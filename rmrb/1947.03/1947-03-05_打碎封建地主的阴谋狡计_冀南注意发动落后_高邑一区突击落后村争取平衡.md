　　[Jinnan, March 3rd] In Xinxian County, the two villages on the west road of the fifth district had a landlord, Mr. So-and-so, with a family of two and seventy-two mu of land. In an attempt to evade burdens and struggle, he had long ago divided sixty-six mu of land among nine poor peasant families to cultivate, and drew up false documents and contracts. The contract stated that the land would be returned to him when the “ground surface” changed (meaning the Central Army arrived). After the leading cadres discovered this matter, they immediately convened all members to expose the landlord's conspiracy and explain that the reason for poverty was exploitation by the landlord, and that the land belonged to the peasants and should be returned to them. On the spot, a poor peasant who had been cultivating the landlord's land said sadly: "Only now do I understand that the landlord is like a 'weasel visiting a hen,' with no good intentions. I will never be fooled by them again." Subsequently, the peasant association fostered grievances and launched a struggle against the landlord. All sixty-six mu of the landlord's land was returned to the peasant association and redistributed rationally to the peasants. Weixian County paid attention to inspiring the masses to voice their grievances, and mobilized backward masses to investigate rent reduction. At a mass grievance meeting in Zhongyuanbao Village, Tian ×× said with emotion: "My family is still keeping things for the landlord! Because I didn't understand the landlord's crimes in the past, it's too late to report it now, and I'm very sorry to everyone." The masses rewarded him on the spot. Then twenty-four people reported that they were keeping clothes, utensils, farm tools, etc. for the landlord, and they have all been taken out and handed over to the peasant association.
　　[Jinnan, March 3rd] Jixian County continues to conduct in-depth inspections and has found that many cunning landlords have been overlooked, and is now re-launching the struggle. For example, the Southeast Neighborhood in the Fourth District overlooked fifteen landlord households, and thirty-three landlord households were not thoroughly purged. The Southwest Neighborhood overlooked fifty-four households, and thirty-one were not thorough. The Northwest Neighborhood overlooked five households, and twenty-five were not thorough. Most villages have not weakened the landlords' floating wealth, and they still have too many houses left. The reasons for this were reviewed as follows: (1) Landlords falsely divided their families, dispersed their land, reduced their target, and superficially became middle peasants, but in essence, they still maintained their landlord lifestyle and ruling position. For example, in Xuejiazhai in the Fifth District, a landlord with three or four qing of land was discovered. Three generations of the family had divided, but they still controlled the village regime and ruled the peasants. (2) Fugitive landlords dispersed their land, asking others to cultivate, eat, and pay differential grain, retaining their land rights. Some falsely pawned it; such landlords have not been purged in Matou in the Fifth District and Xinzhai in the Fourth District. (3) Many landlords pretended to be enlightened and offered their land at the beginning of the mass movement, and the masses were embarrassed to fight them again. The landlords wooed the cadres everywhere, reducing the degree of elimination by lowering their class status or calling them "enlightened." (4) Landlords spread the idea that the situation would change: for example, the masses in Lijiazhuang, Matou in the Fifth District, did not dare to fight against the landlord who was the commander of the Chiang Kai-shek army. (5) The classification of class status was incorrect. Some landlords were classified as rich peasants or well-to-do middle peasants. Some only looked at the land, and some only looked at the mode of operation, without taking a comprehensive view. (6) Cadres did not conduct in-depth investigations and research to help the masses conduct historical class analysis. Many people held the idea that "it's almost there" and considered it done.
　　[Taihang, March 3rd] The filling-in movement in Gaoyi First District is now concentrating its efforts on storming backward villages and striving for balance. Through two months of large-scale campaigns last December and January this year, the district has achieved great results, but due to the lack of thoroughness in the work style of the cadres and the poor ideological mobilization, it has also created many backward villages. At the district and village cadres' meeting on the 9th of last month, the past shortcomings were clarified through review; and it was determined that the main task in the future is to concentrate forces, attack backward villages, and mobilize all backward peasants. After several days of in-depth inspection, the following problems were discovered: (1) Cadres are not thorough. The work in Xiyan Village was backward in the past, and the district cadre who helped the village was not thorough in his work, and even ate at the house of the local bully landlord, creating the bully landlord's three reds (ie, he was red in front of the stubborn army, red when the Japanese came, and also red in front of the district cadre), and the masses dared not struggle. (2) Landlords pretend to be poor and shake the cadres' fighting spirit. For example, in Caoliu Village, the landlord cried to the × cadre of the overturning team during the struggle, and gave them more things to keep. It has now been found that one landlord household has not been struggled against, and the liquidation of three households is not thorough. (3) Cadres' selfishness. Cadres in Sijiazhuang embezzled the fruits of the movement. After ideological enlightenment, they withdrew, and more than 100 mu of land hidden by landlords were found. At present, each village has conducted a household-by-household investigation, looking for loopholes and finding the tail, and combining winter study to conduct class education, enlightening the backward peasants' consciousness. The cadres mainly focus on opening up the "almost there" mentality and carrying out face-washing and blackening, resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, uniting together, and continuing to struggle against the landlords.

　　打碎封建地主的阴谋狡计
    冀南注意发动落后
    高邑一区突击落后村争取平衡
    【本报冀南三日电】莘县五区西路两村，地主某某全家两口人，七十二亩地，他企图逃避负担与斗争，早就把六十六亩地分给九家贫农种着，并立了假文书和契约，契约上写着换了“地面”再把地给他（“地面”是中央军来的意思）。领导干部发现这个事情后，即召集全体会员揭破地主阴谋，并说明穷的原因是受地主剥削，土地是农民的，应当归还农民。当场有一位分种地主地的贫苦农民痛心的说：“我这才明白了，地主是‘黄鼠狼给鸡拜年’，没有好心眼，从今后再也不上他们的当了。”继而农会酝酿诉苦，向地主进行斗争，该地主六十六亩地全部归农会，重新合理分配给农民。威县注意了启发群众诉苦，发动落后群众查减。中元宝村群众诉苦大会上，田××感动的说：“我家还给地主保存着东西哩！因过去不了解地主罪恶，这样说现在报告出来太晚了，很对不起大伙。”大伙当场奖励了他，继而是二十四个群众报出给地主保存着的衣服、器血、农具等，现已全部拿出交给农会。
    【本报冀南三日电】冀县继续深入检查，发现不少狡猾多端的地主被遗漏，现正重新发动斗争。如四区东南小区遗漏地主十五户，清算不彻底的地主三十三户；西南小区遗漏五十四户，不彻底的三十一户；西北小区遗漏五户，不彻底的二十五户。大部村庄地主的浮财没削弱，宅子还留的太多。检讨原因：（一）地主假分家、疏散土地，缩小目标，表面上变成中农，实质上仍保持地主生活与统治地位。如五区薛家寨查出一个三四顷地的地主，老少三辈都分了家，但目前仍掌握村政权，统治农民。（二）逃亡地主把土地疏散，叫别人自种、自吃、拿差粮，保留他的地权。还有的假当出去；五区码头、四区的新寨就未清算这类地主。（三）不少地主假开明，在群运开始就献了田，群众总不好意思再斗。地主四下拉拢干部，用划低成份或“开明”减低消灭程度。（四）地主散布变天思想：如五区码头李家庄群众对当蒋军军长的地主没敢斗。（五）成份划的不对，有的把地主划为富农或富裕中农，有的只看土地，有的只看经营方式，未有从全面着眼。（六）干部不深入做很好的调查研究，帮助群众进行历史的阶级分析，很多人抱着“差不多”就算了的思想。
    【本报太行三日电】高邑一区的填补运动，现正集中力量突击落后村庄，争取平衡。该区经过去年十二月及今年一月两个月的大规模运动，已收到很大成绩，但由于干部作风的不深入与思想发动差，也造成了不少落后村。在上月九日的区村干部会上，经检讨明确了过去的缺点；并确定今后主要是集中力量，突击落后村庄，发动所有落后农民。经过数天的深入检查，发现有如下问题：（一）干部不深入。西烟村过去工作就落后，而帮助该村的某区干部工作又不深入，且在恶霸地主家吃饭，造成恶霸地主的三红（即顽军跟前红，日本来了红，区干跟前也红），群众不敢斗争。（二）地主装像哭穷，动摇干部斗志，如曹留村地主在斗争中给翻身队×干部哭一阵说一阵，即给人家多留东西。现查出地主有一户未斗，三户清算得不彻底。（三）干部的自私思想。寺家庄干部在运动中贪污果实，经思想打通退出后，又查出地主隐藏土地百余亩。现各村均进行了逐户调查、寻窟窿、找尾巴，并结合冬学进行阶级教育，启发落后农民觉悟，干部中主要是打通差不多思想与进行洗脸擦黑，解决干群关系，团结起来，向地主继续斗争。
