Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 11th: According to reports from the Central News Agency, after the "February 28th" incident occurred in Taiwan, and after several days of superficial calm, the "February 28th Handling Committee" organized by the people made thirty-two demands, which were rejected by the Chiang government. They then demanded that the Chiang government's troops in the area voluntarily order a temporary disarmament, which was also refused. On the 8th, Taiwanese people launched armed attacks on the Chiang government's military and political organs in Taipei and Keelung, forcing Chiang's troops to disarm. In Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, amidst the darkness, the sounds of rifles, machine guns, and grenades resounded. The attacked organs included the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, the Garrison Headquarters, the Yuanshan Naval Office, the Huashancho Police Department, the Supply Bureau warehouse, and the Army Hospital. Gunfire continued from 10:30 PM until the next morning. The Keelung Fortress Headquarters was attacked at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. The Kuomintang Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters stated that the people's resistance movement started in a corner of Taipei, occupying the radio station. The news spread, and government organs throughout the province were either occupied or destroyed, and administrative organs throughout the province were "either hijacked or humiliated." An Associated Press dispatch on the 9th stated: Some county governments were occupied by the people. The Central News Agency stated: Yang Lianggong, Kuomintang Minister of Supervision for Fujian and Taiwan, led two battalions of military police from Fujian and landed at Keelung port on the 8th. On the 9th, while en route to Taipei, they were attacked by people's teams holding small cannons, rifles, and grenades. During the battle, Yang's aide, Liu Qikun, had a finger broken, and a military policeman was injured. Yang himself was startled and fell. Since the "February 28th" incident, Chief Executive Chen Yi and the heads of various departments have been hiding in the Administrative Office, afraid to go home. Since the 7th, the Loyal Service Corps and young students organized by the people in Taipei have been patrolling and searching for guns and documents of Chiang's officials. Chen Yi's younger brother, Chen Gongquan's residence was also searched. The Taiwan Central News Agency's telephone line was also cut. Zhou Yihe, the head of Chiang's Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, requested the "February 28th" Handling Committee to stop searching residences starting on the 8th, but this was rejected. Chiang's officials, who usually oppress the people, are now sitting on pins and needles, eager to leave. On the 7th and 8th alone, thousands of people registered for ship berths at the "China Merchants Steam Navigation Company."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 10th: Taipei Dispatch: After Chen Yi announced the Chiang government's softening policy towards the resistance movement on the 6th, thousands of Taipei citizens held a demonstration on the 8th. This procession was held after attending the funeral of Chen Fuxi. Chen Fuxi was shot and killed by Chiang's police for participating in the anti-Chiang government tobacco monopoly on February 28th.

    【新华社延安十一日电】据中央社透露，台湾自“二、二八”事变发生后，经数日之表面平静，七日人民组织之“二、二八处理委员会”提出的三十二项要求被蒋政府拒绝后，即要求蒋政府在当地之部队自动下令暂时解除武装，亦被拒绝。八日台人乃于台北、基隆两地对蒋政府军政机关发动武装进攻，强迫蒋军缴械。黑夜中之台湾首府台北市，步枪机枪手榴弹之声大作，被袭击之机关有台省行政公署、警备司令部、圆山海军办事处，桦山町警务处、供应局仓库及陆军医院等，自夜十时半直至次晨，枪声不绝。基隆要塞司令部于下午二时被攻击。台省国民党警备司令部则谓人民反抗运动自台北一隅开端，占据广播电台，风声所播，全省政府机关或被占领、或被捣毁，全省行政机关“或被劫持，或被殴辱”。美联社九日电称：有的县政府被人民占领。中央社称：国民党闽台监察使杨亮功，自闽率领宪兵两营，八日在基隆港口登岸后，九日转赴台北，途中亦被持有小炮步枪手榴弹之人民队伍袭击；对战中，杨之随员刘启坤被击断手指，宪兵一名受伤，杨本人亦受惊跌倒。目“二、二八”事变后，行政长官陈仪及各处处长均藏身行政公署，不敢回家。七日起，台北市面有人民组织之忠义服务队及青年学生，巡逻与搜查蒋记官员之枪支、文件等。陈仪之弟陈公铨住宅亦被搜查，台湾中央社之电话亦被截断，蒋记台省行政处长周一鹤八日起“二、二八”处理委员会请求停止搜查住宅，已遭拒绝。平日鱼肉人民之蒋记官员，现均如坐针毡，急于求去。仅七、八两日往“招商局”登记船位者即达数千人。
    【新华社延安十日电】台北讯：在六日陈仪宣布蒋政府对反抗运动的软化政策后，台北市民数千人于八日举行示威游行，此一游行系参加陈抚溪的葬礼后举行者。按陈抚溪因参加上月二十八日反抗蒋政府烟草专卖之时被蒋警开枪杀死。
