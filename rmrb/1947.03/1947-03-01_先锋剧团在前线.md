　　Vanguard Troupe on the Front Lines
    The Vanguard Troupe set off for the front on January 16th. Taking advantage of the troops' rest during the old Lunar New Year, they immediately went to various brigades to perform "The White Haired Girl." Before the performances, they went to the troops to collect heroic deeds and model materials, which were compiled into快板 (clapperdash) and folk songs and performed on stage, which was very popular with the comrades in the troops. Especially the performance in the "Wutai" unit had the best results. The troupe arrived at their residence and immediately looked for propaganda cadres to talk about heroic materials that night. They wrote them overnight, and the next night they sang three folk songs and one快板 (clapperdash). The audience exclaimed in surprise: "Wow, they only arrived yesterday afternoon, and in one day they compiled our heroes into songs and快板 (clapperdash)s...". Currently, the troupe has successively written folk songs about anti-Japanese heroes such as "Ding Qiuqiu," "Zhang Xiangshun," "Niu Bangfan," and "Pang Baoshun," as well as快板 (clapperdash)s such as "Killing the Enemy Hero and Model Worker Ding Qiuqiu," "Killing the Enemy Hero Li Hongxi," and "Model Eleventh Company," and five long and short communications. They have also begun writing small operas based on real people and real events. (Lǚ Nà)
