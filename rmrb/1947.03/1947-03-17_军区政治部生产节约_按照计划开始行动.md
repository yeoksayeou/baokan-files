　　Military Region Political Department Production and Thrift
    Action Commences According to Plan
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The production and thrift campaign of the Military Region Political Department has entered the action phase. The department's original production plan was: to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables for the entire year by planting 61 mu of dry and irrigated land, yielding over 122,000 jin of vegetables. The flour mill and kitchen will raise 80 to 90 pigs, providing each person with 2 jin of meat per month. The department will solve its annual needs for soy sauce, vinegar, tofu, cooking oil, and salt through its own production. A small transportation team will also be organized to engage in transportation and production. Individual production tasks will be assigned based on work circumstances and physical conditions, ranging from 150 jin to 300 jin of millet. The total value of the above production items is estimated at 18 million yuan. On the thrift side: collective dining will be implemented, with weighed ingredients and controlled cooking, along with other measures, resulting in a total annual savings of over 575,000 yuan. In total this can reach 18,570,000 yuan. After the plan was announced, the General Affairs Section's tofu workshop and transportation team were established successively. Comrade Zhang Nanshan, the head of the Organization Department, collects bones every morning (for fertilizer) in preparation for planting vegetables. Comrade Zhang's actions motivated all comrades. Comrade Lin has knitted seven pairs of woolen socks and three sweaters, completing the task of handing over 262 jin of millet to the public. The Communications Class is even more enthusiastic. Comrade Hu Guangwen collects manure while delivering letters, achieving great results. The entire class has accumulated over 3,000 jin of manure. Significant progress has also been made in thrift. According to preliminary statistics, the subsidies for rice, clothing, shoes, and socks saved by various units can be totaled to 736,700 yuan.
