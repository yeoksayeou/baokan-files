    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 21st: In the victorious campaign where the Democratic Allied Army annihilated a division of Du Yuming's troops south of the Songhua River, 100,000 liberated peasants from Northeast China enthusiastically participated, demonstrating the people's iron will to resolutely eliminate Chiang. Countless stretcher teams and long convoys of vehicles, horses, and medical personnel raced day and night across the frozen and thawing north and south banks of the Songhua River. This time, Baya, Shulan, Tonghe, and Wuchang counties mobilized 20,000 people and 5,000 horses, forming 1,400 stretcher teams and 1,000 carts. County heads and county-level cadres served as battalion commanders and set out with the teams. Stretcher team members in Shuangcheng County vowed an oath of allegiance by drinking blood, vying to achieve meritorious service. Zhao Shouting and Liu Jingyan, members of the Democratic Youth League in Bayan County, and others requested to go to the front lines to assist in the battle. When the Democratic Allied Army crossed the frozen Songhua River southward to counterattack the invading Chiang troops, thousands of stretchers and civilians advanced at a marching speed of ninety li per night, competing to participate in the front lines, shooting and capturing Chiang troops, and promoting the happy life of the liberated areas to the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. In the vast plains providing camouflage for the troops, transfer stations were established everywhere. When the Democratic Allied Army soldiers passed through the villages, the masses competed to express their sympathy, and women specially made red flowers to present to the wounded.
