Yubei Frontline Troops Practice Military Skills, Implement the Mass Line, and Develop New Methods by Promoting Mass Wisdom
[This newspaper, Taihang, 20th dispatch] The "Hanyang" troops on the Yubei Frontline, after returning from the Tangyin battle, under the slogan of "Learn skills and perform meritorious service for the people," carried out a military training movement that implemented the mass line, and during training, highly promoted the wisdom of the masses. During a combat demonstration exercise by a certain regiment, the regimental leaders took on the roles of company commander, political instructor, quartermaster, etc., and based on actual combat needs, practiced and studied in sections, completely abandoning the old ways and textbook limitations, which resulted in great success. Zhang Longsuo's squad from the 7th Company, after observing the demonstration, immediately and automatically researched methods for pursuing and eliminating the enemy. In five days, they exceeded the spring training plan. Crossing a 30-meter open field with a prepared springboard, which previously took five minutes, now only takes 18 seconds. Previously, crossing a blocked ditch and a 50-meter open field with a prepared ladder required ten people and ten minutes, now it only requires five people and 40 seconds. Regarding small artillery techniques, new methods were also created through mutual assistance and spontaneous research by the masses. The Ma Si small artillery squad of the 6th Company of a certain regiment, with nine people, originally had only two who knew how to operate the artillery, but now all of them do. In practicing night-time firing at flares, they use a hat to cover their eyes during the day to measure angles, and the deviation in firing at distances from 100 to 200 meters is very small. Artillery ammunition handlers participate in measurements to reduce deviations. This training has created an overall enthusiastic atmosphere, and the previously so-called "dead corners" (miscellaneous affairs, telephone supply, etc. personnel) have also become unprecedentedly active. For example, in a night exercise to secretly pass under an enemy bunker and install a six-li (three kilometer) telephone line (twelve li round trip), it only takes 50 minutes. The grooms go out to train their horses before dawn, and after three days of practice, they can jump over a three-foot wide blocked ditch, and saddling and loading four horses has been reduced from 16 minutes to 7 minutes. Mass cultural activities during training are also very active. In addition to the companies reproducing small newspapers and pictorials, the group wrote 1,774 articles in four days, including clappers, poems, communication plans, etc. Evaluating red points, meritorious service books, meritorious service lists, meritorious service reports, medals, reporting to superiors, compiling books, and drawing portraits, and engraving names on captured weapons, have also become the goals that every commander and fighter strives for in the meritorious service training movement. Comrades who did not perform meritorious service in the last battle have expressed their determination: "Watch us next time!" (Liu Zhi)

[This newspaper, Taihang, 20th dispatch] The first phase of the Yubei Frontline's "Hanyang" unit's training and meritorious service movement has been successfully completed. The small artillery techniques of various units have been significantly improved during the training. The small artillery squad of the "Wangjiapo" 5th Detachment, in order to master the deviation of shooting distance and angle, through intensive research and hard training, most of them can now hit the target. The creativity of the masses was fully promoted during the training, such as creating: (1) Eye adjustment measurement (alternating eye observation). For moving targets, the distance between the targets measured by both eyes should be measured with a rope to correct deviations, and the sense of eyesight should also be combined to observe the differences in movements and colors. Take a human figure as a moving target for trial measurement, and then compare whether the target is moving towards a high ground or a low-lying area, so that the target can be hit. (2) Night light trial measurement. If the target distance is 50 meters, the light pattern remains unchanged; at 60 meters, the light is blurred; at 70 meters, the light emits four-cornered light; at 80 meters, the light is straight up and down; at 100 to 150 meters, the light is straight up and down, and explodes around. Using this observation in combination with the feeling of the fingers and arms when shooting can overcome more angle deviations. Both methods are easy to implement and accurate. Yang Dazhen, the small artillery squad leader of the 2nd Company of "Liujiapo," after hard training, can hit the target with every shot at a distance of 80 meters. He has already set the next phase plan to hit the target within 100 meters. Li Guiru, the deputy squad leader of the 9th Company's small artillery squad, used a shoe to support the tail of the gun when shooting directly with live ammunition, flexibly determined the position, and hit an eight-inch gun hole in the wall 60 meters away with one shot, which was immediately applauded by the entire audience. Ma Zhanxi of the "Wangjiapo" 6th Company's small artillery squad studied that it is difficult to erect a sight on the battlefield under enemy fire. He broke with convention and experimented with standing and prone measurements, and obtained a unified number for the distance from the three forms of observation. In order to practice killing the enemy's command post, the squad specially disguised a person to wave a flag and run, and determined the firing distance based on the original flag size and the observed ratio. Previously, the shooting target deviation of the veteran in the squad was often 10 meters, and that of the novice was 20 meters. After this intensive study and hard training, the veteran's deviation was only half a meter, and the novice's deviation was six or seven meters.

    豫北前线练兵贯彻群众路线
    发扬群众智慧创造了新办法
    【本报太行二十日电】豫北前线“汉阳”部队从汤阴战役归来，在“学本领为人民立功”的口号下，贯彻群众路线的练兵运动，练兵中高度发挥了群众的智慧。某团战斗示范演习时，团首长分任连长、政指、司务长等，根据实战需要，分段演习，分段研究，完全抛弃过去老一套及书本限制，结果非常成功。七连张龙锁班参观回来，亦即自动研究出班追击消灭敌人的办法。在五天中，超过了春季练兵计划。通过卅米达开阔地平架好跳板，过去需五分钟，现仅需十八秒。过去通过封锁沟及五十米达开阔地平架好梯子需十人十分钟，现仅需五人四十秒。小炮技术，因组织互助，群众自动研究，亦创造了新办法。某团六连马四小炮班，九个人，原二人会打，现已全会。练习夜间打火光，以白天用帽子遮眼测角度，一百米到二百米之距离发射偏差甚小。炮兵弹药手参加测量，减少偏差。这次练兵形成全面热潮，过去的所谓“死角”（杂务、电话供给等人员），亦空前活跃起来。如夜间演习秘密通过敌碉堡下架通六里电线（往返十二里），仅需五十分钟。马夫不等天亮外出练马，经三天练习即能跳过三尺宽的封锁沟，上下四匹马的鞍驮由十六分减到七分钟。练兵中群众性的文化活动也很活跃，除各连复写小报、画报外，四天中集团即写作一千七百七十四篇稿件，有快板、诗、通讯计划等，评红分、记功簿、立功榜、报功单、奖章、上报、编书、画像，缴获武器刻上名字，亦成为立功练兵运动中每个指战员争取的奋斗目标。上次战役没立下功的同志，均表示决心：“下次看”！（刘志）
    【本报太行二十日电】豫北前线我“汉阳”部练兵立功运动，第一期计划已胜利完成。练兵中各部队小炮技术有显著提高。“王家坡”五分队小炮班，为掌握射击距离与角度的偏差，经全力研究苦练，大部已能命中。训练中充分发扬了群众的创造，如创造了：（一）调眼测（两眼调换观测）。对活动目标要在两眼所测目标距离间，用绳子度量，纠正偏差，还要结合眼力感觉，看动作颜色之不同，以人形作活动目标试测，再看目标活动方向是向高地或凹地来作比较，就可命中目标。（二）晚上灯光试测。目标距离如五十公尺者，灯样不变；六十公尺，灯光发花；七十公尺发出四角光；八十公尺灯光上下成直线；一百至一百五十公尺，灯光上下直冲，周围发炸，以此观测结合射击时手指与胳膊的感觉，能较多克服角度的偏差，两法均易行而准确。“刘家坡”二连小炮班长杨大珍，经过苦练，距离八十公尺远即能弹弹命中。他已订出下期计划要百公尺内命中目标。九连小炮班副班长李贵如，实弹平射时，用一只鞋支在炮尾，灵活订定方位，一炮即命中六十米外墙上的八寸枪眼内，全场立即报以掌声。“王家坡”六连小炮班马占喜研究战场上在敌人火力下很难立测，他即打破陈规，实验立测、卧测后，从三种形式的观测中得出距离远近的统一数字。该小炮班为练习杀伤敌人指挥处，特伪装一人摇旗奔跑，视原旗大小与观察所得的比例决定发射距离。原该班老手射击目标偏差数经常为十米达，新手二十米达，经过此次钻研苦练，老手只偏差半米达，新手六七米达。
