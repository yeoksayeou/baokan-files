　　The Third Battalion in the Battle of Wanglou
    Li Wenbo, Battalion Commander of the Third Battalion of the 92nd Unit
    This battle dispatch, written by Li Wenbo, battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the 92nd Unit, is simple and vivid. It describes not only the entire course of the battle, but also the lively scenes and prominent figures within it. The reason it is so is that Comrade Li Wenbo was a participant in the Battle of Wanglou. We hope that military personnel will write more battle dispatches, and we advocate "write about what you do."

    The Third Battalion of the 92nd Unit, serving as the vanguard on the night of January 13th, pursued and annihilated the remnants of Zhang Lanfeng's troops in the direction of Chengwu. They were required to occupy Wanglou by dawn to intercept the routed soldiers and cover the main force's deployment. Upon arriving at Wanglou before dawn, the battle commenced.

    The Sentry Squad Was the Assault Squad
    Comrade Zhang Bingxun, squad leader of the Third Squad of the Ninth Company, led his entire squad as the sentry, searching for a guide. Noticing a light emanating from a doorway, Squad Leader Zhang peered through the crack and saw four KMT sentries, cradling their bayonet-fixed rifles, dozing off around the fire. As they pushed the door open, the enemy raised their heads, only to be met with several bayonets pointed at their chests. Without uttering a sound, the enemy laid down their weapons. Comrade Zhang Bingxun, along with two soldiers, rushed into the courtyard, hearing snoring coming from the house. They surged inside, and an entire enemy platoon surrendered their weapons! Without firing a single shot, they captured thirty-six men, three machine guns, thirty-two rifles, and one pistol. Upon exiting the house, there were no longer any enemies on the roof. They immediately transformed into an assault squad, launching an attack on the enemy at the south gate.

    Disarming with Bare Hands
    After the Ninth Company opened fire, orders were sent for the Seventh Company to rush forward. Political Instructor Wang Xiqin and Branch Secretary Hao Guanglu urged the troops to keep up. Suddenly, they heard two machine guns being set up behind them. Political Instructor Wang turned around, grabbed the gun barrels, and began to wrestle fiercely. Wang, unarmed, exerted all his strength and slapped the enemy across the face. As the enemy loosened his grip to touch his face, Wang managed to seize the machine gun. Turning his head, he saw Comrade Hao Guanglu already carrying the other one on his shoulder. The two of them, bounding and leaping, caught up with the troops to continue leading the battle.

    Li Yongwen Fights Alone in Two Courtyards
    Clerk Li Yongwen from the battalion headquarters stormed into a courtyard. The enemy fired at him from the houses, but he did not retreat. He continued forward to the doorway of the second gate, only to find another courtyard inside, where the enemy also opened fire. He used up all three of his hand grenades! Still unable to suppress the enemy's firepower, he happened upon a pile of hand grenades scattered haphazardly in the doorway. With this new weapon, Comrade Li Yongwen rained grenades into both courtyards, shouting powerful slogans: "The village is lost, surrender and be spared!" The enemies in both courtyards surrendered. He led twelve prisoners, one machine gun, and nine rifles to report his accomplishment.

    Shi Deming Achieves Another Great Merit
    Hero Shi Deming led two new soldiers from his squad, charging into a courtyard south of the road. Upon entering the main gate, they captured four prisoners before they could even remove the enemy's ammunition pouches. A group of enemies then rushed out of the house. Shi Deming, quick-witted and nimble, threw two hand grenades in quick succession, and the two new soldiers also threw two. The enemy turned around and ran back into the house. Comrade Shi Deming rushed forward, grabbed the one at the rear, and seized a twenty-round Mauser pistol. The remaining enemies stubbornly defended the house. Undeterred, he calmly handed the prisoners and weapons over to the two new soldiers to guard, then gathered the prisoners' hand grenades, one after another throwing over a dozen through the windows. The enemy in the house threw out their guns, and he captured sixteen men, obtaining seven pistols and eight rifles.

    Appropriate Slogans
    The Third Platoon of the Eighth Company was fighting outwards from the street, eliminating the enemy north of the road and then expanding to the south. The enemy blocked the road crossing with machine gun fire. Platoon Leader Shang Jinsheng was the first to charge across, followed by Comrade Li Rutong, who was wounded! Zhou Wenjie was also injured at this crossing. Seeing that the men's movements were slowing, Platoon Leader Shang shouted loudly: "Come on! Capturing Zhang Lanfeng is the greatest merit!" The soldiers surged forward, occupying the enemy's courtyard. The enemy retreated to a small building to resist. Platoon Leader Shang again saw the enemy's weakness and said: "Comrades, the enemy has no hand grenades! The closer we get to the small building, the safer it is to fire!" Indeed, the soldiers approached the small building and threw grenades, completely wiping out this force of over fifty enemies.

    Medic Xing Bucheng
    Medic Qu Yanbin was wounded while rescuing the wounded, so Medic Xing Bucheng of the Ninth Company immediately took over the emergency work for both companies. Under the enemy's fire, he constantly checked the positions of each squad and platoon. When there were wounded, he not only changed their bandages and carried them off the front line, but also delivered their blankets and weapons to them. Guo Changjiang, who had just joined the army, said, "I really admire the Eighth Route Army's care for the wounded. No matter how fierce the fighting, they never abandon them!" When there were no wounded, he joined the squad in combat. He and the Third Platoon were besieging a courtyard when he heard moaning sounds behind him. He abandoned the opportunity for an easy victory and ran to the rescue, only to return from changing the bandages for the wounded of the machine gun and artillery company to see the Ninth Squad exchanging hand grenades with the enemy in the courtyard and on the roof. The enemy occupied the roof, and hand grenades alone could not resolve the battle! The comrades of the Ninth Squad formed a human ladder to climb onto the roof and engage in bayonet fighting. Squad Leader Wang Lushan's upper body had just reached the edge of the roof when he was wounded! It was impossible to fight if he went up, and the roof was too high to come down. In this extremely urgent situation, Medic Xing Bucheng jumped down from the roof, threw a barrage of hand grenades to suppress the enemy's fire, and quickly climbed up the broken foundation to pull Comrade Wang Lushan down. Squad Leader Wang said, "The medic is my savior!"

    The Last Blockhouse
    Most of the enemy had been eliminated, but only one blockhouse in the southwest was still resisting, throwing many hand grenades down. The First Battalion forced its way to the front, but was blocked by the hand grenades and could not climb onto the roof. The regiment's attached flat trajectory gun fired three accurate shots, suppressing the enemy's fire. The First Platoon of the Eighth Company, seizing the opportunity, maneuvered around the enemy's rear from the southwest corner, crossing over a hundred meters of open ground. The platoon leader was wounded! Squad Leader Zhao Sanyuan and Squad Leader Gao Yintang automatically led the team forward. They bravely stormed onto the roof, but the enemy had retreated to the lower level of the blockhouse! Without using a ladder, they jumped down from the roof, rushed into the blockhouse, and captured the last fifty-odd enemies alive.

    Small Statistics
    In this battle, we suffered only thirty-three minor injuries, capturing a total of 365 enemies, seizing two heavy machine guns, eleven light machine guns, 175 rifles, 23 pistols, two small cannons, eleven warhorses, more than 40,000 rounds of ammunition, including 1,500 rounds of pistol ammunition, telephones, binoculars, canteens, satchels, and a large pile of other items.

　　王楼战斗中的第三营
    九二部队三营营长  李文波
    这篇战斗通讯，是九二部队三营营长李文波的作品，写得朴素而生动，既写出了战斗的全过程，又描绘了战斗中的生动场面与突出人物。其所以能如此，是由于李文波同志是王楼战斗的参与者之故。我们希望军事人员多写战斗通讯，我们提倡“做什么”就“写什么。”
    ——编者
    九二部队三营，在一月十三号的夜里，担任前卫，向城武方向追歼张岚峰残部，必须于天明进占王楼，截击溃兵，以掩护主力展开。拂晓前到达王楼，战斗就开始了。
    尖兵班就是突击班
    九连三班长张丙勋同志，率全班担任尖兵，去找向导，见门洞里露出火光，张班长隔门缝一看，四个蒋军哨兵，抱着上刺刀的步枪，围着火打瞌睡，他们一推门进去，当敌人抬起头来，几支刺刀早对住胸口，敌人一声没哼就放下了武器。张丙勋同志带着两个战士，冲进院去，听见屋里还在打呼噜，他们一涌进去，敌人的一个排就缴了枪！一枪没发，就捉了三十六个人，机枪三挺，步枪三十二支，手枪一支。走出房来时，房上已没了敌人，他们立即变成突击班，向南门敌人进攻。
    徒手夺机枪
    九连打响以后，传令七连跑步前去，七连政指王希琴和支书郝光禄督促部队跟上，忽听背后边叭一声支起了两挺机枪，王政指回头抓住敌人的枪身，两人就拚命的夺起来，手无寸铁的王政指，用尽平生力气，照敌人脸上一个耳光，当敌人松手抚脸的时候，王政指才把机枪夺过来，他一回头看见郝光禄同志，早把那一挺扛在肩上了，两人一崩三跳的又赶上部队继续领导战斗。
    李永文独战双院
    营部号目李永文同志，突进一个院去，敌人从房子里向他射击，他没有后退，继续前进到二门的门洞里，不想里边又是一个院子，敌人也向他打枪，他把仅有的三个手榴弹打完了！还是压不住敌人的火力，恰巧门洞里零三八四的扔着一片手榴弹，李永文同志得了这武器，便雨点似的向前后院打去，并喊出了强有力的口号：“村里都完了，缴枪不杀！”前后院敌人都缴枪了，他带着十二个俘虏一挺机枪九支步枪报功去了。
    史德明再立大功
    英雄史德明带着本班两个新战士，冲进路南一个院里去，一进大门就捉了四个俘虏，还没有摘完敌人的子弹袋。从屋里又冲出来一群，史德明手急眼快，一连打了两个手榴弹，两个新战士也打了两个，敌人回头又往屋里跑，史德明同志赶上去把后边的一个抓过来，缴了一架二十响。其余敌人在屋里死守，他不慌不忙，把捉的人和武器交给两个新战士看守，自己把俘虏的手榴弹集中起来，一个接一个的从窗眼里打十几个，打得屋里扔出枪来，他捉了十六个人，得了七枝手枪，八枝步枪。
    适当的口号
    八连三排是从街里往外打，消灭完路北敌人又往路南发展，敌人用机枪封锁了道口，排长商金生首先冲过去，接着李如同志前进负伤了！周文杰也在这个道口上挂了彩，眼看人们动作慢了，商排长大声说：“来呀，捉住了张岚峰是第一功！”战士们一拥过去。占了敌人的院子，敌人退到小楼上抵抗，商排长又看到敌人的弱点说：“同志们敌人没有手榴弹，小楼上打枪越近越保险！”真的战士们逼近小楼投弹，把这股五十多个敌人全部解决。
    卫生员邢步成
    卫生员渠炎斌同志，因抢救彩号负伤了！九连卫生员邢步成同志，马上就负起两个连的救急工作，在敌人火网下不断到各班排阵地上检查，有了彩号他不但给换了药背下火线，还把彩号的被包和武器送到跟前，解放来的郭长江说：“我真佩服八路军的救彩号，打多急也扔不了！”没有彩号的时候他就参加班里作战，他和三排正围攻一个院子，听见后边有呻吟声音，他舍了伸手可得的战功，跑去救急，才给机炮连的伤号换药回来，看见九班在院里和房上的敌人对投手榴弹，敌人占了房顶，光凭手榴弹是解不了战斗了！九班的同志搭成人梯要上房去拚刺刀，班长王路山的上身才爬住房沿，就负伤了！上去是不能战斗，下来吧房又太高，在这万分紧急的时候，卫生员邢步成跳到房下，扔出一阵手榴弹压住敌人的火力，很快的爬上破墙基，把王路山同志接下来，王班长说：“卫生员是我的救命恩人啊！”
    最后一个炮楼
    大部敌人被消灭了，只有西南一个炮楼还在抵抗，并有很多的手榴弹往下打，我们一营逼到跟前，被手榴弹封锁住不能上房，团里附属了平射炮，三发三准，才压住敌人的火力。八连一排看准了火候，就从西南角往敌人背后迂回过去，经过百多米的开阔地，排长负伤了！一班长赵三元和二班长高银堂同志，自动的把队伍带上去，他勇猛的突上了房顶，敌人却钻到炮楼的下层去了！他们没用梯子从房上跳下去，一涌扑进炮楼，把最后五十多个敌人活捉了来。
    小统计
    这次战斗我仅负轻伤三十三人，共俘敌三百六十五名，缴重机枪两挺，轻机枪十一挺，步枪一百七十五枝、手枪二十三架、小炮两门、战马十一匹、子弹四万多发、并有手枪子弹一千五百发、电话机、望远镜、水壶、挂包等一大堆。
