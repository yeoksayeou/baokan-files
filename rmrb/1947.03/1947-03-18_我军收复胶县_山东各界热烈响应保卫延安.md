　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong Front, 16th: The East China People's Liberation Army recovered Jiaoxian City on the Jiaoji Railway at 9:00 AM on the 11th. The Kuomintang special forces, the Transportation Police 3rd, 5th, and 10th Regiments, and one battalion of the 12th Regiment, which had occupied the city, fled towards Qingdao in two routes at dawn on the same day. Jiaoxian City was first liberated from the enemy and puppet forces by the Eighth Route Army on August 19, 1945. Since then, it has been occupied twice by Kuomintang and puppet troops. This is the third liberation.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 15th: A dispatch from Central Shandong reports: Jiang Huaishu, a 53-year-old innkeeper from Luxi Town, Tai'an District, Central Shandong, shot down a Kuomintang plane assisting in the battle during the fierce fighting in Laiwu on the afternoon of February 23rd. At that time, two Kuomintang planes were flying low and wreaking havoc over Luxi Town (22.5 miles west of Laiwu). Jiang Huaishu was searching for Kuomintang stragglers in a small woods north of the town when he raised his gun and fired, hitting the fuselage. The plane crashed near Shijia Quanzi, about five miles north of the town. The two pilots were killed instantly, and six American-made machine guns and some ammunition were seized from the plane.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th: "Immediately mobilize, and take practical action to defend Yan'an, defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and defend Chairman Mao!" This is the unanimous slogan shouted by the 30 million soldiers and civilians in the Shandong Liberated Area after hearing the news of the Kuomintang's attack on Yan'an. Wang Hongqi, a new soldier in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, proposed to the whole class to write a letter to Chairman Mao, stating, "We are eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Shandong, and we will work even harder to fight in the future to defend Yan'an." Gao Zanfei, Speaker of the Binhai District Council, issued a statement calling on the three million people of the district to step up spring plowing, do everything possible to support the front, and cooperate in defending Yan'an. All cadres, party members, government officials, soldiers and civilians in the Bohai area are practicing frugality to support the front, handing over 1.5 million Northern Currency. More than 90% of the cadres directly under the administrative office are saving all allowances, clothing, and other supplies. All units are launching a three-pronged (all units, all year, all items) savings competition.

　　我军收复胶县
    山东各界热烈响应保卫延安
    【新华社山东前线十六日电】华东人民解放军于十一日上午九时收复胶济路上之胶县城。侵据该城之蒋介石特务部队交通警察第三、第五、第十等三个总队及第十二总队之一个大队，当日拂晓分两路向青岛方向逃窜。按胶县城一九四五年八月十九日八路军首次从敌伪手中解放，此后曾两度被蒋军与伪军侵占，此次为第三次解放。
    【新华社山东十五日电】鲁中讯：鲁中泰山区鲁西镇五十三岁酒店店员江怀树，于二月二十三日下午莱芜激战之际，以一枪击落助战蒋机一架。当时蒋机二架在鲁西镇（莱芜西二十二五里）上空低飞肆虐，江怀树正在镇北小树林内搜索蒋军散兵，即举枪一击，正中机身，该机随即堕落于镇北五里许石家泉子附近，驾驶员两名当时毙命，机上美造机枪六挺及弹药一部被缴获。
    【新华社山东十六日电】“立即动员起来，以实际行动保卫延安、保卫陕甘宁、保卫毛主席”，这是山东解放区三千万军民听到蒋军进攻延安消息后一致喊出的口号。人民解放军某部新战士王洪起向全班提议写信给毛主席，要写上“我们在山东正在消灭蒋介石军队，以后更要使劲的打仗，来保卫延安”。滨海区参议长高赞非氏发表谈话，号召全区三百万人民加紧春耕，尽一切力量支援前线，配合保卫延安。渤海党政军民全体干部节衣缩食，支援前线，交公北币一百五十万元，行署直属机关百分之九十以上的干部节约全部津贴衣服等供给品，各机关正展开三全（即全机关、全年、全部）节约竞赛。
