    People's "Meritorious Servants"
    A Record of the An'yang Heroes Commendation Meeting
    Cheng Guang
    On March 7th, at the An'yang Heroes Commendation Meeting, the heroes who were engaged in a life-and-death, blood-and-fire struggle with the enemy, in their unrestrained speeches about their heroic deeds, painted a vivid picture for us of the An'yang people's victorious struggle.
    Meng Zhicai, who had just been liberated, had his nephew and sister-in-law killed after the enemy occupied Shuiye and Guantai. He bravely joined the mass work team and, like many other farmers active in the An'yang area, began to fight. He said to everyone, "It's either the enemy or me. As long as they don't kill me, this matter can't be settled!" He persuaded his angry brother, "Anger won't bring back your wife; only action will!" When he and his brother went behind enemy lines to fight, he once captured a major local tyrant in his village with his bare hands. The tyrant knelt down and repeatedly called him uncle, but he said, "I've never seen an uncle kill his niece's husband; I have to hand you over to the people!" This ignited the flames of counter-liquidation behind enemy lines.
    The people rose up from hatred and learned the art of war. Shen Cheng'san, who appeared day and night behind enemy lines, was a very "courageous" young man. He carried a gun and often argued with the enemy and puppets while working. Once, three "Homecoming Corps" members chased him with sticks and guns in the wilderness. He circled around with the enemy twice, but couldn't shake them off, so he cleverly climbed onto an embankment. "Damn you, you want my life!" He raised his gun and shot the one chasing in front. The other two bad guys turned and ran into the ditch.
    As the struggle intensified, the "Homecoming Corps" and "fight captains" huddled together, with wooden planks and thorns placed on walls and outside houses. To consolidate the points and lines they occupied, the Chiang Kai-shek puppets built walls in many places, changing streets and terrain. Bunkers were built together, forming a triangular crossfire network, with landmines buried along the roadsides in an attempt to preserve their doomed fate. But the unyielding people of An'yang established guerrilla bases here.
    "Flying Tiger on the Roof" - Hu Degui, a strong-willed and tall people's hero, used his flying capture skills to strike at the "Homecoming Corps" in the Sixth District, supporting the masses in counter-liquidation. In Huangmaidian, there was a particularly bad spy named Han, who went in and out of the east and west gates, wantonly oppressing the people. The masses demanded his punishment. One day, Hu Degui found out that Han was sleeping at home, so he took his brothers, crossed over the thorny walls, and dragged Han out of his sleep. Immediately afterwards, he went to capture the "old Baozhang" (village head). The Baozhang jumped off the roof to escape, but Hu Degui flipped down from the roof with a "whirlwind" (a kind of jump in Chinese martial arts). He rushed forward with the most skilled "arrow step" and immediately captured the puppet Baozhang. The villagers inside the house were amazed and secretly laughing. Comrade Hu Degui captured several bad guys that night. Since April, he has captured more than sixty Homecoming Corps members in this area, and the situation in the Sixth District has gradually opened up in this way.
    Landmine expert Yang Kuanxing is one of the most admirable heroes. The enemy buried many Hanyang-made landmines the size of small millstones outside the bunkers, which had injured several villagers in the Second District. Comrade Yang Kuanxing made four life-or-death decisions to figure out how to defuse the enemy's mines. The first time he touched a mine, no one dared to move. He gritted his teeth and carefully dug away the soil around the landmine with his hands. Under the mine, he found a horizontal wire. He didn't dare to move it and brought the mine back intact. After careful speculation during the day, he identified that the wire was not a detonating tube and also found a small off-center hole two-tenths of an inch in size on the side of the mine. Everyone thought this might be a fatal spot, and people stayed far away, afraid to act. Yang Kuanxing thought about it for several days, cut a piece of tin from a foreign bucket, and prepared to plug it in. "Damn it, to save others from dying, it's right for me to die; in another twenty-three years I'll be this old again!" That day, he prepared everything, ready to die, and inserted the tin piece into the hole, but it didn't explode. He studied it repeatedly and finally proved that this was the place where the firing pin was pressed. Putting on the tin piece could separate the firing pin from the ignition. He stepped on it to test it and there was no danger. From then on, whenever he encountered a "small millstone mine," it became a victory product in Yang Kuanxing's hands.
    The people of An'yang on the front line of struggle have broken through the dark clouds behind enemy lines and seen the blue sky.

    人民的“汗马功臣”
    记安阳群英表功会
    程光
    三月七日，在安阳群英表功大会上，与敌人进行着生与死、血与火的斗争的英雄们，在他们尽情谈吐的英雄事迹中，给我们描绘出了一幅安阳人民斗争胜利的活的图景来。
    刚翻了身的孟之才，敌人占水冶、观台后，他的侄儿和嫂嫂被杀死，他就奋身加入群工队，和别的许多活跃在安阳土地上的农民一样开始了战斗。他向大家说：“有敌没我，只要没有把我打死，事情总算不能了结！”他对发气的哥哥劝说：“气不活老婆，只有干才是路！”他和哥哥一块伸向敌后作起斗争时，一次他赤手把他村的一个大恶霸抓到了。恶霸跪下连声叫舅舅，他说：“我没见过杀妗的外甥，非交给人民来办你不行！”点燃了敌后反倒算的烽火。
    人民从仇恨中站了起来，又学会了战争。日夜出没在敌后的申诚三，是非常“有种”的一个青年小伙子。他挂着枪常与敌伪扛着脖子作工作。有一次，有三个“还乡团”拿着棍子和枪，在野地里追捉他，他和敌人兜了两个圈子，还是摆不脱，他就机警的爬向一个堰头，“娘卖的你想要命哩吧！”他端起枪把追在前面的那个揍到了，那两个坏家伙，拔腿就跑向沟里去了。
    在斗争日益剧烈化后，“还乡团”、“斗头兵”都缩拢到一起，墙头房外插起了木板圪针。蒋伪为巩固所占点线，在许多地方构筑了围墙，改变了街道、地形，碉堡都筑在一起，构成三角形的交叉火力网，各路旁埋上地雷，以图保全其救不活了的命运。但安阳不屈的人民却就在这里建立了游击根据地。
    “房上飞虎”——胡德贵这个性子强悍、身材高大的人民英雄，他在敌后六区以飞行捕捉，打击着“还乡团”，为群众反倒算撑腰。黄买店有个最坏的特务韩某，东门进西门出，肆意欺压人，群众要求惩掉他。胡德贵一天探到韩某在家睡觉，便带着弟兄，越过墙头圪针，将韩某从睡梦中抓出。随即又去抓“老保长”，保长跳房想逃走，胡德贵便一个“旋风”（国术中一种跳法）翻下房来，他以耍武最熟练的“箭步”冲上，当即擒住伪保长。老乡们都在房内惊奇着，暗笑着。一夜就把几个坏家伙都捉住了胡德贵同志。四月来先后在这一带共捕捉六十多个还乡团，六区的局面就是这样逐渐打开的。
    起雷手杨宽兴是最使人敬佩的一位英雄。敌人在碉堡外埋上许多如小磨大的汉阳造地雷，在二区炸过好几个老乡。杨宽兴同志下了四次必死的决心，来想法起敌人的雷。头一次摸到了雷谁也不敢动，他咬了咬牙，谨慎的先把地雷周围的土用手挖去，在雷底上发觉一根横串的铁丝，他没敢翻动，将雷原封端回来了。经白天细细揣测，辨清那铁丝不是爆发管，又发觉地雷边上有二分大的一个偏孔，大家觉得这可能是要命的地方，人们都离的远远的不敢下手。杨宽兴想了好几天，剪下一个洋桶片，准备塞进去。“娘卖的，为了少死人，我死也是应该的，再过二十三年又这么大！”那天他就办好一切，准备着死，将洋铁片塞进那孔里去，但并没有响了。他又反复研究，终于证明这是爆发管按火的地方，一上洋铁片，可把还发管与引火隔开来。他踏上试了试也没危险。从此，每遇到“小磨雷”、便成为杨宽兴手中的胜利品了。
    在斗争线上的安阳人民，已拨开敌后的乌云，看到了青天。
