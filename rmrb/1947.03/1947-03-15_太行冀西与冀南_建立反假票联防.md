Taihang, Western Hebei and Southern Hebei
Establish Joint Anti-Counterfeit Currency Defense
[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 12th] In order to crush the shameless conspiracy of Chiang's special agents to print counterfeit currency and disrupt the financial system of the liberated areas, the anti-counterfeit currency work of the First Branch of the Southern Hebei Bank, with the efforts of local Party, government, military, and people, has created a mass movement. From August to the end of last year, a large number of Chiang-made counterfeit notes were seized. It has now been decided that the Gao Yi, Nei Qiu, Lin Cheng, Xingtai, and Shahe branches will go to the county branches in the areas connecting Hebei-Central and Hebei-South to discuss the establishment of a joint anti-counterfeit currency defense and exchange experiences. Currently, Lin Cheng and Yaoshan in Southern Hebei, and Shahe and Yongnian in Southern Hebei have been established. Gao Yi has also sent personnel to Zhaoxian and Ningjin counties in Central Hebei to discuss establishment.
