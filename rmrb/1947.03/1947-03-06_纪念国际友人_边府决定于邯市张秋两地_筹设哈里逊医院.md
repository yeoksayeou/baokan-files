　　Commemorating International Friend
    Border Government Decides to Establish Harrison Hospitals in Handan and Zhangqiu
    [Our Newspaper] Dr. Harrison (TILLSON L. HABRISON. M.D.) of the Tianjin Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, spared no effort in providing medical relief to the Chinese people, traveling to various places. He also suffered persecution and obstruction from the Chiang Kai-shek side during his work. Due to his advanced age and overwork, Dr. Harrison unfortunately passed away in Zhangqiu County on January 9th. All sectors of our border region deeply mourn his passing. Therefore, Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Zhao of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government convened a meeting on February 26th and decided to establish two Harrison Hospitals in Handan City and Zhangqiu County. Director Zhu Lian of the Border Region Health Bureau will be responsible for the preparations, in order to commemorate him.
