　　Latin American Resistance to American Expansion
    Peruvian Parties Form Anti-American Alliance

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Although American imperialism's aggressive behavior toward Latin America is hidden under the guise of "Pan-American Mutual Defense," it still provokes growing opposition from the Latin American people. According to a TASS report: Several powerful parties in Peru, including the People's Party, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the National Action Party, recently formed a broad alliance, declaring their opposition to the reactionary infiltration of American imperialism into Peru and the important position currently held in the government by the APRA party, particularly against the party's further concessions to Standard Oil. In Cuba, at the Seventh National Congress of the Socialist Party, the party's General Secretary Roca stated on the 7th that the situation in Cuba was "extremely dangerous," and that reactionaries supported by American imperialists were attempting to launch a coup and push the government to implement reactionary policies. Roca called on the Cuban people to rise up to stop the reaction and support the government's progressive measures.
