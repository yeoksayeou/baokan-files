    Book Promotion at the Front Lines
    Qí Yǔ
    The People's Pictorial Society of the Propaganda Department of the Jilu Yu Frontline Field Political Department is printing various colored pictures and portraits of Chairman Mao, which are being distributed to commanders and fighters at the front. The first is a photographic portrait of Chairman Mao, available in one-inch and two-inch sizes, with Chairman Mao's famous sayings printed on top of colored patterns: "Serve the people, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, make persistent efforts, unite as one to fight to the end, have a firm political direction, a hard-working style, and flexible strategies and tactics." The first batch of 1,200 copies was sent out on March 17. The second type is postcards. The third type is woodcut colored pictures. The first picture shows three heroes on horseback, with the following written below: "The sun is redder, and the flowers are redder, help each other to achieve merit and be a hero, red horse, white horse, big flowered horse, add merit upon merit again and again." The second picture shows soldiers attacking a city, "Cannons fire at the city head, a sea of red, three people help each other with one heart, I throw bombs, you shoot guns, cover the troops to charge up." The third is: "The sky is full of dust, the ground is full of grass, beat the enemy so they have nowhere to run, you capture prisoners, he seizes guns, I carry the mortar on my shoulder." During the troop training period, comrades such as Ai Yan from the Art Group of the Propaganda Department of a certain unit's Field Political Department went deep into a certain unit on the front line and created a training pictorial, which was posted and exhibited in the companies in the form of wall newspapers. The content of the pictorial included sketches of the activities of training heroes, cooks, and health workers, and the pictures were painted in color. They also explained them to the soldiers in person. Many company and platoon cadres, due to their poor education level, could not read newspapers, but they greatly welcomed colored pictures depicting the lives of soldiers. The publication of such book wall newspapers will greatly improve the cultural life of the soldiers in the frontline field troops.
