Wu'an Cadres Conserve, Quit Cigarettes, and Smoke Pipe Tobacco

[This newspaper] News from our publication: A wave of production and conservation is sweeping through Wu'an's government offices and schools. Li Fucang, the head of the Chengguan District, personally led cadres to sell water, earning 7,000 yuan in ten days. Comrade Wang Xunxun made tofu and earned a net profit of 2,000 yuan, excluding the bean dregs. Secretary Lu Guangxing completed his production task by spinning cotton. They unanimously agreed to suspend clothing, dyeing, office, and allowance expenses from March. The Political Department, the Military Committee, and the Relief Association, in addition to saving two months' worth of clothing, food, vegetable money, and full-year allowances and office expenses, also stipulated that each person should complete a production task of 200 jin of rice and 300 jin of vegetables. Currently, the cooks have earned 20,000 yuan by grinding flour and ginning cotton, and the communications team has earned 6,000 yuan by chopping firewood. The county normal school's thirty-five spinning wheels can produce five jin of thread per day. Principal Wang Wenyan has even created a light and convenient foot-operated single-strand spinning wheel for foreign thread, which is both good and fast. Many cadres have switched from smoking cigarettes to smoking pipe tobacco. And some cadres have quit smoking altogether.
