　　New Areas Must Pay Attention to Conserving Civilian Labor
To the Editors:
    Our Ninth District of Cixian County is a newly liberated area. Recently, many villagers have sold their personal belongings and livestock. When asked why, they say: Having carts and livestock means too much requisitioning for labor service, so it's better to sell them and save trouble! The government originally stipulated two fair methods for requisitioning labor service, but because we are a new area, there are some deviations in the implementation of these methods in various villages. The biggest problem is that the cadres' families do not provide labor service. Taking Linshui Village as an example, out of 349 households in the whole village, 43 village cadres do not provide labor service. Some village cadres have carts and horses but do not provide service, and they randomly allocate labor and carts and horses from the masses, making the masses dissatisfied with our government and dissatisfied with the cadres, reflecting the unfair and excessive labor service requisitioning. Now is the busy spring season, and I hope this will attract attention everywhere. We must calculate accurately and conserve civilian labor. In particular, district and village cadres should cherish the civilian labor in their villages. Except for a small number of village cadres who must stick to daily work and cannot provide labor service, most village cadres should take the lead in providing labor service, mobilizing their own families to provide service, and should never be self-important or arbitrarily allocate labor, wasting civilian labor. If my opinion is correct, please publish it in the newspaper.
    With Respect,
      Reader, Li Min

### 新区要注意节省民力

    大·家·谈
　　新区要注意节省民力编辑同志：
    我们磁县九区是新解放区，近来有不少村子的老百姓，把自家的事和牲口卖了。问他们为啥这样，他们说：有了车和牲口，支差太多，不如卖了省事！本来政府曾规定过两次公平支差办法，但由于我们这边是新区，在各村执行时有些偏差，里面最大的毛病是干部家里不支差。以临水村来说，全村三百四十九户，就有四十三个村干部不支差，有些村干部家有车有马也不出差，而乱拨用群众的差和车马，使群众对我们政府不满，对干部不满，反映支差不公，支差过重。现在正是春忙时期，我希望各地引起注意，要精确计算，节省民力，特别是区村干部，应该爱护自己村里的民力，一个村中除不得已要坚持日常工作的少数村干不能支差外，大部村干应该带头支差，发动自家支差，绝不可自大特殊，更不可胡乱拨差，浪费民力。我这意见如果对的话，请你给我登在报上。敬礼      读者李敏
