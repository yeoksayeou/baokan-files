[Report from this newspaper in Taihang on the 1st] Since its establishment at the beginning of the year, the Changzhi "City and County Urban-Rural Issues Mediation Group" has mediated 73 cases involving urban-rural disputes over the fruits of labor, etc., up to the 18th of this month. The mediation has yielded several experiences: (1) Grasping the spirit that poor people in the city and countryside are one family and should fight together to achieve liberation makes mediation extremely smooth. During the movement, rural masses felt that asking targets in the city to hand over their gains was somewhat slow and unsatisfactory. At the same time, some urban masses believed that rural masses were "randomly targeting" and "randomly taking gains," which hindered the production enthusiasm of workers, citizens, and shop employees. Therefore, during mediation, it is necessary to eliminate dissatisfaction on both sides and focus attention on local tyrants and evil landlords. Bitu Village and Shangxi Street in the city were fighting over six market houses. After mediation, the thinking of both sides was unified. A cadre from Shangxi Street said, "We are all one family, it doesn't matter, consider the houses yours. It's easy to handle when we talk it through." After self-criticism, a cadre from Bitu said, "Our attitude was not good, we hope the cadres and masses of Shangxi Street will forgive us." The problem was resolved with laughter and good humor. (2) Mediation should not only resolve conflicts, but also boldly support and empower the masses on both sides. When cadres and masses of Lujiazhuang called on the Zheng Yi [Justice] Store in the city to struggle against the target Wang Fuxiu (a shop employee), the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Commercial Federation believed that Wang "did not show a bad attitude towards the movement. If he is taken away, it will affect the morale of other shop employees." After investigation by the group, it was found that Wang was a loyal lackey of the big landlord Yang Anhui. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Commercial Federation immediately agreed completely. During the struggle, Wang Fuxiu was indeed found to have hidden most of the landlord's silver dollars and four gold rings. After this resolution, the masses of Lujiazhuang were more satisfied, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also believed that Wang was not an honest shop employee; it is worthwhile to inspect and cleanse shop employees. (3) Be careful to prevent landlords from creating trouble and inciting discord during mediation. The landlord Wang Eryang of Jiaojiazhuang had already returned five houses in the city to the masses of the village, but then Wang went to the city to "donate" the houses to the masses of Xijie, thus causing a conflict between the masses of both sides. After the facts were clarified, the masses on both sides immediately concentrated their efforts to overthrow the landlord. The mediation group actively and proactively serves the masses. Sometimes, even if they miss meals, they must first solve the problem, which the masses call the "Conflict Resolution Committee."

　　揭破地主阴谋  保证城乡团结
    长治获得调解城乡纠纷经验
    【本报太行一日电】长治“市县城乡问题调解小组”，自年初成立以来，迄本月十八日止，共调解城乡争夺果实等问题七十三件。调解中获得几点经验：（一）掌握城乡穷人是一家，共同斗争来翻身的精神，调解极为顺利。运动中乡村群众感到去城里叫对象拿果实，总有些拖延不爽快，同时城市群众，有些认为乡村群众是“乱叫对象”和“乱拿果实”，有碍工人市民和店员生产情绪。故调解时，即需消除双方不满，把两者间注意力集中转向恶霸地主。璧头村与城里上西街争要六间市房，经调解后，双方思想统一，上西街干部说：“自己人，没关系，房子算你们哩，话说通了就好办”。璧头干部检讨后说：“俺们态度不好，上西街干部群众要原谅。”问题嘻嘻哈哈得到解决。（二）调解中不单是解圪瘩，应给双方群众大胆撑腰作主。鹿家庄干部群众向城内正义商店叫斗争对象王福秀（店员）时，市联工会与商联会，认为王“对运动态度表现不坏，如叫走要影响其他店员情绪”。经小组调查后，王乃系大地主杨安惠一只忠实走狗。市联工会商联会即完全同意。斗争中，王福秀果真藏有地主之大部现洋及金戒指四个。这样解决后，鹿家庄群众比较满意，市联工会亦认为王非老实店员；店员中颇值检查清洗。（三）调解中谨防地主捣鬼挑拨。焦家庄地主王二羊，早已将城内五间房退还该村群众，可是王又到城内将房“献给”西街群众，故使双方群众闹起纠葛。事实调查清后，双方群众即集中力量，斗垮地主、调处小组，积极主动为群众服务，有时，甚至误了吃饭，也要先解决问题，群众称之为“解疙瘩委员会”。
