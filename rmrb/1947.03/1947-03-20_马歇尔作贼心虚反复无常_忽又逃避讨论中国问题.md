Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Reports from various sources: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 16th, formally rejecting the Soviet government's proposal to "hear a report from the participating countries of the previous Moscow Conference on the implementation of the decisions on the China issue." Marshall refused any discussion, whether China participated or not, and only proposed that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union exchange information on China in writing before April 1st. This exchange of information would be strictly limited to mutual obligations, namely the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from China, and a copy of the exchanged information must be sent to China. In the past week, Marshall has shown a capricious attitude towards whether or how the Moscow Conference should discuss the China issue. When Molotov made the proposal at the first meeting, Marshall, in principle, "agreed to discuss this issue at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference but requested time to consider and review the procedures for this issue." At the second meeting, Marshall changed his attitude and agreed with Bevin's opinion that the foreign ministers of the three powers should discuss this issue informally, and also requested that Chinese representatives participate in this discussion. After the meeting, Molotov separately informed Marshall and Bevin about this matter, agreeing with Marshall's proposal and formally confirming it. Marshall's reply to Molotov on the 16th is a response to this matter, which is another change in Marshall's attitude. Marshall's flip-flopping aims to avoid reviewing the implementation of the resolutions on the China issue in any form at the Moscow Conference. The current situation in China has been completely undermining the principles of the Moscow Conference's declaration on China due to the serious interference of U.S. imperialism.

　　马歇尔作贼心虚反复无常
    忽又逃避讨论中国问题
    【新华社延安十八日电】各方报导：美国务卿马歇尔于十六日致函苏外长莫洛托夫，正式拒绝苏联政府关于“听取前次莫斯科会议参与国关于中国问题决定实施情形之报告”的建议。马歇尔拒绝不论中国参加与否之任何讨论，仅只提议于四月一日以前由美英苏三国彼此以书面方式交换关于中国之情报，且交换情报仅将严格限于相互之义务一事，即美苏军队自中国之撤退，并须以交换情报之副本送达中国。马歇尔在过去一周中，对莫斯科会议是否或者采取何种方式讨论中国问题，表现了反复无常的态度。当莫洛托夫在首次会议上提出建议时，马歇尔原则上“同意在莫斯科外长会议上讨论此问题，但要求给予时间以考虑检讨此问题之程序”。在第二次会议上，马歇改变了他的态度，赞成贝文的意见，即由三强外长非正式的讨论这一问题，也要求中国代表亦参加这一讨论。会后，莫洛托夫关于此事曾分别照会马歇尔与贝文，同意马歇尔等之主张，并正式确认此事。马歇尔十六日给莫洛托夫之复函，即系对此事之答复，此乃马歇尔态度之又一次的改变。马歇尔之三翻四复，其目的在于逃避在莫斯科会议上以任何形式检讨中国问题决议之实施情况。而目前之中国情势，已因美帝国主义之严重干涉，而将莫斯科会议关于中国宣言的原则破坏无遗。
