　　Central Government Organs Inspect Production and Savings; Discover Many Activists and Models; Various Organs Have Gained Preliminary Production Experience
    [Our Newspaper] The Central Bureau Administrative Bureau and General Branch Committee jointly convened a meeting of central government organs on the 5th of this month to inspect the implementation of production and savings tasks and exchange experiences among units. Representatives from seven units attended, including the Central Bureau, Xinhua Bookstore, Radio Station, Party School, Reception Office, and People's Daily. The reports from each organ indicated an unprecedented surge in production enthusiasm among comrades in directly affiliated organs. In less than a month, over five hundred staff members have joined the production front, creating and utilizing more than thirty production methods—such as spinning, weaving, printing, battery charging, contracting work, selling labor, and various small workshops. Each unit has achieved considerable success. For example, the Central Bureau already has forty-six comrades who have handed in 3,219 catties of millet to fulfill their quotas. Central government organs have saved 65,173 catties of millet in personal savings alone, and many comrades have saved all the clothing they were entitled to receive. During the production process, leaders took the lead, personally engaging in hands-on work, and activists and models emerged continuously. It is projected that by the end of this year, central government organs will complete tasks totaling over 100,000 catties of millet. After detailed discussion, the meeting summarized preliminary experiences as follows:

    1.  The organ branch and administrative departments should constantly use various methods to mobilize, inspect the implementation of individual production plans, so that the movement develops in a balanced way and persists. In terms of leadership methods, attention should be paid to combining with the masses' consciousness.

    2.  There must be a strong production leadership organization to carry out specific organizational work, effectively solve problems, and support the movement. For example, the newspaper office's production leadership organization coordinates production funds, production tools, and the supply and sales of raw materials and products, which greatly increased the comrades' production enthusiasm, and various production methods emerged accordingly. Regularly commend models and cultivate core personnel; carefully select production group leaders. Otherwise, even if the leadership pays attention, it will still be difficult to get things going. For example, Comrade Ma Lishan, a messenger in the Central Bureau, can only stay at home for ten days a month, but by the end of February, he had already completed tasks worth 8,600 yuan. Minister Nie personally sprouted soybeans and has already handed in tasks totaling 50 catties of millet. Hygiene worker Huo Weimin gets up early and works late, carrying 184 loads of water for the hotel room without affecting his work and study, earning 5,000 yuan. These activists in production have all been commended by the branch, which has further promoted the production movement in their respective units.

    3.  In the production movement, public and private interests must be taken into account to make it clear to everyone ideologically that production should not only solve the financial difficulties of the organs but also solve individual difficulties. In addition to handing over to the public, personal household needs should also be established. This will better guarantee the movement.

    4.  Grasp the production center and seasonality. The production center should gradually form in the movement, rather than being predetermined. At the same time, pay attention to the season and seize the opportunity. For example, weaving sweaters now will occupy funds for a long time and cannot be circulated for continuous production. However, handicrafts such as spinning and weaving are easy to sustain, are not restricted by the season, and the time can be flexibly arranged, which is very suitable for organ personnel and should be promoted and created.

    5.  Combining production with business and supply is the best way. The Xinhua Bookstore and the editorial department of the newspaper office engage in printing, and the comrades of the newspaper office and radio station charge batteries. On the one hand, it is easy to control the time, and on the other hand, it enriches business knowledge. Many other organ comrades open their own mills to supply the organs with noodles, combining production with needs, ensuring the source of raw materials and the sales of finished products.

    The meeting stipulated the standards for production activists: First, have a correct labor concept, do not speculate and take shortcuts, and honestly create wealth through labor. Second, actively participate in production and be able to help others and promote others. (Guo Wei)

　　中直检查生产节约  发现了不少积极分子与模范  各机关已取得初步生产经验
    【本报讯】中央局管理局和总支委于本月五日联合召开中直各机关会议，检查生产节约任务的执行情形，交流各单位经验。出席有中央局、新华书店、广播电台、党校、招待处、人民日报等七单位。各机关的汇报，说明了直属机关同志的生产热情空前高涨。不到一个月，已有五百名以上的工作人员涌入生产战线。并创造与运用了三十多种生产方法——如纺织、印刷、充电、包工、卖工及各种小作坊等……，各单位都已获得相当成绩，如中央局已有四十六位同志交了三千二百十九斤小米的任务，中直各机关仅个人方面已节约小米六万五千一百七十三斤，许多同志节约了全部应领的衣物。在生产过程中，首长带头，亲自动手，积极分子与模范不断出现。预计今年年底中直各机关将完成十万斤米以上的任务。经过详尽讨论，会上总结出初步经验如下：
    一、机关支部与行政双方，应经常不断的运用各种方法进行动员，检查个人生产计划执行情形，使运动开展平衡，坚持下去。在领导方法上，应抓紧结合群众的自觉性。
    二、必须有坚强的生产领导机构，进行具体的组织工作，有效地解决问题、扶持运动。如报馆的生产领导机构统筹生产资金与生产工具及原料产品的供销问题，大大地提高了同志们的生产情绪，多种多样的生产方法随之产生。经常表扬模范培养骨干，慎重选拔生产小组长。否则，只有领导上注意，仍不易搞起来。如中央局交通员马立山同志，一月只能在家住十天，到二月底就已完成了八千六百元的任务。聂部长亲自动手生豆芽，也已交了五十斤米的任务。卫生员霍卫民起早搭黑，在不影响工作学习的条件下，给店房挑水一八四担，赚洋五千元。这些生产中的积极分子都已得到了支部的表扬，同时也更进一步的推动了所属单位的生产运动。
    三、生产运动中必须公私兼顾，使大家在思想上明确，生产不仅要解决机关经费的困难，同时也要解决个人困难。除交公外，还要建立个人家务。这样运动会更有保证。
    四、掌握生产中心与季节性。生产中心要在运动中逐渐形成，而不是预先规定。同时要注意季节，抓紧时机。如现在织毛衣，就将长期占用资金，不能周转流通，继续生产。而纺织等手工业即易持久，不受季节限制，时间又能灵活支配，很适合于机关人员，应加以推广与创造。
    五、生产结合业务、结合供给，是最好的办法。新华书店与报馆编辑部搞印刷，报馆电台同志充电，一方面容易掌握时间，同时也丰富了业务知识。其他不少机关同志自己开磨房供给机关吃面，以生产结合了需要，原料来源与成品销路更有保证。
    会上规定了生产积极分子的标准：第一、劳动观念正确，不投机取巧，老老实实从劳动中创造财富者。第二、自己积极参加生产，并能帮助别人推动别人。（郭渭）
