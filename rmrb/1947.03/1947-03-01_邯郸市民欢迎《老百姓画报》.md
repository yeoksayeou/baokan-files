　　Handan Citizens Welcome "The People's Pictorial"
    The "People's Pictorial," published by the Handan Municipal Public Education Center since last autumn, has been well-received by the masses due to its close coordination with various key tasks in the city. Last year, during the emergency preparations for war, after it was discovered that Li Qingxin, a special agent in the city's Ganhegou area, had assassinated village cadres, spread rumors of "regime change," and sabotaged war preparations, the newspaper immediately collected materials and published them as a comic strip, which greatly promoted mass mobilization and war preparation work. Now that spring is approaching and a city-wide sanitation campaign has been launched, Comrade Kang Yaolin of the newspaper, based on facts, has created various critical and commendatory illustrations, which are even more popular among the masses.

　　邯郸市民欢迎《老百姓画报》
    邯郸市民众教育馆去秋以来出刊的《老百姓画报》，因为繁密的配合了全市各种中心工作，深得群众好评。去年紧急备战时，发现该市干河沟特务李清心暗杀村干部，造谣“变天”，破坏备战等情况后，该报即马上搜集材料，画成连环画出刊，对群运及备战工作，给了很大推动。现在春天快到，全市掀起卫生扫除运动，该报康瑶琳同志等，根据事实制出各种批评与表扬的画，更受群众欢迎。（赵寒）
