    [This newspaper's Jilu Yu Frontline dispatch on the 19th] The local corps of the Jilu Yu region recovered Jiaxiang city on March 12th, and the battle results are being tallied. After Chiang's army's 75th division invaded our Jiaxiang on the 20th of last month, our local armed forces of the first and third districts and the vast turned-over peasant guerrillas besieged and harassed the enemy day and night, and the enemy did not dare to take a step outside of Ji. Our guerrilla corps also frequently operated on the enemy's supply line on the Jin (xiang) Jia (xiang) highway, making it impossible to provide the enemy with supplies and ammunition. The enemy then abandoned the city on the 12th of this month and fled to Jining in a panic. Our army is currently pursuing them. Jiaxiang was liberated from the Japanese invaders by our Jilu Yu People's Liberation Army during the great counter-offensive in October 1945. Chiang's army first occupied it on October 18th last year, and our army recovered it again on January 1st this year, before Chiang's army invaded it again on February 20th. This is the third time it has been recovered.

    [Xinhua News Agency Northeast Dispatch on the 18th] After the Democratic Allied Army in the Jilin area routed Chiang's army's 87th division and the 71st Army's direct units, and annihilated the main force of its 88th division, our Liaodong Military Region captured Huanren County, about 70 kilometers southwest of Tonghua in Andong Province, in one fell swoop at 7:00 am on the 17th. The city was occupied by units of the 91st Division of Chiang's army's 71st Army on October 31st last year. As of the end of last month, five county towns in Andong Province, namely Jinchuan, Liuhe, Ji'an, Huinan, and Huanren, have returned to the hands of the people.

    [Xinhua News Agency West Manchuria Dispatch on the 18th] A certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army has recovered Kaoshantun (40 kilometers northwest of Dehui), an important stronghold of Chiang's army on the south bank of the Songhua River, for the third time. The battle began on the evening of the 8th and ended on the evening of the 10th. One battalion of the 362nd Regiment of the 88th Division of Chiang's army's 71st Army, seven infantry companies of the 263rd Regiment, one machine gun company, and one artillery platoon, all entrenched in the area, were completely annihilated. Over a thousand prisoners were captured alone. Detailed battle results are being tallied.

    安东收复桓仁吉北俘敌千余
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十九日电】鲁西南地方兵团于三月十二日收复嘉祥城，战果正清查中。上月二十日，蒋军七十五师一部侵入我嘉祥后，我一、三两分区地方武装与广大的翻身农民游击队，日夜围困袭扰，敌人不敢出冀一步。我游击兵团并经常活动于金（乡）嘉（祥）公路敌之补给线上，使敌给养弹药无法救济，该敌乃于本月十二日弃城向济宁怆慌逃去，我军刻正追击中。按嘉祥系我冀鲁豫人民解放军于一九四五年十月大反攻时由日寇手中解放，蒋军于去年十月十八日第一次侵占，今年一月一日又为我军收复，旋于二月二十日又为蒋军侵占，这次是第三次收复。

    【新华社西满十八日电】民主联军某部第三次收复松花江南岸之蒋军重要据点靠山屯（德惠西北四十公里）。战斗自八日晚开始至十日晚结束，侵踞该地之蒋军七十一军八十八师三六二团一个营，二六三团七个步兵连，一个机枪连，一个炮兵排，全部就歼，仅生俘即达一千余人。详细战果正清查中。
