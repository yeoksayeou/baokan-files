Ideological Exchange

　　Comrades Zhao Tongfeng and Shi Yang:

　　Regarding the question raised by Comrade Zhao in his current affairs study: "When the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries are on the verge of collapse, will American imperialism directly help Chiang Kai-shek by sending troops to participate in the Chinese civil war to attack the Liberated Areas?" Comrade Shi's letter asks: "If the United States directly helps, can we still win?" Here is a combined response:

　　As you pointed out, "directly helping Chiang Kai-shek by sending troops to participate in the Chinese civil war to attack the Liberated Areas," based on various facts over the past year, American imperialism, while not the direct protagonist in the Chinese civil war today, is a behind-the-scenes director. American imperialism is cunning. Today, it does not yet need to attack the Liberated Areas by directly participating in the war. In the past year, it has equipped Chiang Kai-shek with more than 40 divisions, sent 271 warships, helped with loans and materials worth more than 200 million US dollars, and sent nearly 1,000 advisors to help him fight. Since Marshall left China, it has abandoned the pretense of "mediation" and continues to openly support Chiang's internal war militarily, politically, and economically. Chiang's attack on Yan'an was precisely with its support (please refer to the Liberation Daily commentary on page one of this newspaper on the 10th regarding the role of American imperialism in promoting the final division of China.) Although its aggression is so blatant, it still does not dare to directly send troops on a large scale at present.

　　American imperialism does not not want to come forward. It has made over thirty overtures, but many conditions make it unable to not have concerns. First of all, the powerful army and people of the Liberated Areas, the invincible People's Army, have demonstrated an inviolable strength, making it afraid to act rashly. The anti-American fervor of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas also makes it shudder. Secondly, it lacks a just cause. An aggressive war would arouse strong opposition from its own people. The American Communist Party, industrial unions, and progressive democrats have already launched vigorous opposition movements. Furthermore, in today's world, the degree of people's awareness has increased, the organized democratic forces and the growth of communist parties in various countries are stronger, and especially the solid position of socialist Soviet Union in the international arena makes it not so easy for any imperialist to relive the old dream of fascist aggression. Molotov's recent proposal for the Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the China issue is nothing less than a serious warning to American aggression. Therefore, there are currently no signs to judge that it will definitely directly send troops. But this is not to say that it will absolutely not do so in the future. Eliminating this possibility mainly depends on the struggle of the people in the Liberated Areas and the whole country, and the assistance of the American and world people. Finally, it will be made to watch its foster son collapse, and not dare to come forward.

　　However, having said that, even if it lends guns and cannons and US dollars like this today, and dares to send troops to participate in the war in the future, what's so great about it? The United States is an imperialist country whose sun is setting. The people are increasingly dissatisfied with the reactionary authorities after the war, and the number of labor strikes is increasing, even more serious and impossible to resolve than during 1929-1933, and a new special economic crisis will occur this year or next. The expansionist policy of American imperialism has further expanded the contradictions between it and other capitalist countries' colonies and semi-colonies. All this has increased its difficulties and deepened its crisis, forming a seemingly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger. Of course, American imperialists, like Chiang Kai-shek, will not give up until they are "at the Yellow River." Then let them try. In the past year, the United States has given Chiang Kai-shek such heavy support, but as a result, we still wiped out 65 brigades of Chiang's army and captured countless American-made guns and cannons. As Comrade Zhou Enlai said at the Yan'an mobilization meeting: "The United States lent him more than 200 million US dollars in the past year and a half, but it couldn't help him. Even if it lends another 500 million or 700 million this year, it won't be able to help him up." As long as we fight well, even if the United States dares to directly participate in the war, our just, revolutionary, patriotic self-defense war, like the War of Resistance Against Japan, will eventually be victorious!

### 如美国出兵助蒋，我们还会胜利吗？

　　如美国出兵助蒋，我们还会胜利吗？赵桐封  史扬同志：
    赵同志在时事学习中提出的问题：“蒋介石反动派到了崩溃的时候，美帝国主义是否会直接帮助蒋介石出兵参加中国内战进攻解放区？”史同志的来信中问到：“如果美国直接帮助，我们是否还能胜利？”现在合并答复如下：
    您所指“直接帮助蒋介石出兵参加中国内战进攻解放区”，依一年多各种事实看来，美帝国主义今天在中国内战中虽非直接出场的主角，却是一个幕后的导演。美帝国主义是狡猾的，在今天他还不需要以直接出面参战方式来进攻解放区。他一年来装备了蒋介石四十多个师，送了二百七十一只军舰，帮助了借款物资二十多万万美元，派了近一千名顾问帮他打仗。自马歇尔离华以来，更放弃了“调处”的假面具，继续在军事、政治、经济上公开的援蒋内战，蒋之所以进攻延安，也正是有他撑腰（美帝国主义这种促成中国最后分裂的作用，请参看本报十日一版解放日报评论条。）虽然其侵略已露骨如此，但直接出兵，大规模进攻，目前他却还不敢。
    美帝国主义并不是不想出头，他曾逸进过三十余次，但有很多条件，使他不能不有所顾虑。首先是强有力的解放区军民，不可战胜的人民军队表示了不可侮的力量，使其不敢轻举妄动。蒋区人民反美热潮，也使他胆寒。其次，师出无名，侵略战争，会引起他国内人民的强烈反对。美共、产业工会，及进步民主人士，已作了有力的反对运动。再说今后的世界，人民的觉悟程度提高了，有组织的民主力量，和各国共产党的壮大，尤其是社会主义的苏联在国际中的强固地位，使任何一个帝国主义重温法西斯主义侵略的旧梦，都不十分轻便。最近莫洛托夫提议外长会议讨论中国问题，就不啻对美国的侵略，作了一次严重警告。因此在目前尚没任何征兆，判断他一定会直接出兵。但这也不是说他将来绝对不会。消灭这种可能性，主要仍靠解放区和全国人民的奋斗，和美国及世界人民的协助。最后使得他眼看乾儿垮，也不敢出马。
    可是，话又说回来，纵让他今天这样借枪炮借美金，将来竟敢出兵参战，又有什么了不起？美国是个太阳快要落山的帝国主义国家，人民对战后当局的反动日益不满，工潮的有增无已，比之一九二九——一九三三年要更形严重和无法收拾的新的特种经济危机将在今年到明年发生。美国帝国主义的扩张政策，使他和其他资本主义国家殖民地半殖民地间的矛盾更加扩大。这都使他困难增多，危机加深，组成一支外强中干的病虎。当然，美帝国主义者和蒋介石一样，是不到“黄河心不死”的。那末让他们来试试吧。过去一年，美国给予蒋介石这末厚重的支撑，结果，我们还是消灭蒋军六十五个旅，缴获了无数的美械枪炮。正如周恩来同志在延安动员大会上说的：“美国过去一年半，借给他二十多万万美元扶不起他来，今年就是再借五万万或七万万也是扶不起来的。”只要我们好好打，纵使美国敢来直接参战，我们正义的革命的爱国自卫战争，和抗日战争一样，最后也一定要胜利！
