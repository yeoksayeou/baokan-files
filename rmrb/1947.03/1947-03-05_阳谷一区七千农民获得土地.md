　　【Report from JiluYu Headquarters on the 3rd】After the farmers' meeting in Yanggu District 1, seven thousand farmers obtained land. After more than five thousand six hundred farmers in District 1 attended the district conference, through mutual education, they clearly realized that landlords, local bullies, and traitors had seized their land and property. They said, "This will be the world of the poor, and it's time for the poor to collect their debts." After the farmers participating in the farmers' conference returned, from February 10th to the 15th, in just five days, a storm-like "land returns home" movement unfolded vigorously in 106 villages throughout the district. Eighty-three villages have completed their struggles, and seven thousand oppressed and exploited farmers have obtained land.

　　阳谷一区七千农民获得土地
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】阳谷一区农民会议后，七千农民得到土地。一区五千六百余农民，自到区开大会后，在互相教育中，他们很清楚的认识到了地主恶霸汉奸等夺去了他们的土地财产。他们说：“这会是穷人的天下，该穷人要账的时候了。”参加农民大会的农民回去以后，自二月十日到十五只五天，农民们像暴风式的“土地回家”运动在全区一百零六个村庄轰烈展开。已有八十三村斗争完毕，七千受压迫剥削农民得到土地。
