　　Taiyue Fourth Sub-district Review Experience
    Deepen Mobilization, Break Complacency, Clarify Review Spirit and Content
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 14th dispatch] Several counties in the Taiyue Fourth Sub-district, which have largely completed land reform, have undergone three to five inspections and reviews, gaining the following experience: 1. Ideological mobilization for inspection and review: Whether for cadres or the masses, the spirit of the review should be repeatedly explained as completely eliminating feudalism, and it should be done with utmost seriousness. Yangcheng, Gaoping, and Jiyuan have done a better job in this regard. In areas where mobilization is not deep, the review will not uncover problems, and there will be complaints from below, saying that it is making trouble for no reason. If the masses do not understand the purpose of the review, it may cause panic among some middle peasants. In Jiyuan's × village, previous inspections and reviews were poorly mobilized, and a middle peasant became suspicious and hid his cattle at a relative's house. The relative's family was also afraid of being exposed by the review and did not dare to feed the cattle. As a result, the cattle were hidden, and they dared not use the land, preferring to let it lie barren. During this review, it was explained to the middle peasants that the review was not targeting them, and the person suddenly realized and brought the cattle back. When mobilizing for inspection and review, it is necessary to first break the cadres' complacency and the cadres' shielding of the targets of struggle, so that they can consciously check themselves. When Gaoping district cadres went to Weicheng to conduct inspections, village cadres said: "What are you doing here now? Everything has been struggled against, and there is nothing in our village." After the district cadres guided and carried out in-depth inspections, seven feudal vestiges and six landlords and feudal rich peasants who had not been liquidated were discovered. It was also found that these unexposed targets were all somehow related to the cadres. 2. The content of the inspection and review must be clear and specific, and the problems found must be resolved quickly. Yangcheng, Gaoping, and other counties, based on the eight or nine issues instructed by the prefectural committee (such as whether there are feudal landlords engaging in fake struggles, fake being enlightened, or fake donating land in an attempt to evade struggle, etc.) to inspect and review, the masses have a clear direction, can distinguish right from wrong, and can solve problems quickly, resulting in good results. 3. In terms of methods of inspection and review, the main method is in-depth visits from house to house, mobilizing the masses to self-check, and general mobilization meetings are only necessary supplementary methods. Most of the feudal vestiges exposed in this review are related to village cadres, and it is difficult to discover them without going deep. (Taiyue Branch)
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 14th dispatch] Land reform in Qin County has now entered the review stage, and four types of villages have been found where the movement was incomplete: 1. The class division was not clear, causing feudal landlords to evade struggle. 2. There was insufficient understanding of feudal landlords, and they were deceived by the landlords. In the past, some so-called "benevolent rich men" exploited in a relatively mild and skillful manner, and some of the masses mistakenly recognized them as "good people" for a time and did not liquidate them. Some landlords also adopted the method of breaking up the whole into parts. On the surface, they did not have much land, and their original feudal exploitation was forgotten, thus confusing the masses and preventing them from being liquidated for a time. 3. There were biases in the implementation of policies, harming the middle peasants; some landlords were shielded by cadres and remained at large. 4. Cadres did not go deep into the mountain villages and ravines, and the movement was therefore not thoroughly carried out. Now, all cadres in the county are concentrating their efforts to solve the above problems separately. The main experience of this review is to improve the peasants' class consciousness through education in emancipation, improve their understanding of feudal exploitation, and guide them to check themselves and discover various incomplete phenomena.

　　太岳四分区复查经验
    深入动员打破自满明确复查精神内容
    【本报太岳十四日电】太岳四分区大体完成土地改革的几个县，先后都经过三、五次检查和复查，获得几点复查经验：一、检查和复查的思想动员：不论对干部或群众，都应反复说明复查的精神在于彻底消灭封建，应万分认真去做。阳城、高平、济源都做的较好。在没有深入动员的地方，复查就发现不了问题，而且下面埋怨，说是无事找麻烦。群众如不了解复查的目的，还可能造成某些中农的恐慌。济源×村过去几次检查复查，因动员不好，一个中农发生怀疑把牛藏到亲戚家，亲戚家也怕复查出来群众斗争，也不敢喂。结果把牛隐蔽起来，宁让地荒着也不敢用。这次复查中向中农说明不是查农民，这人才恍然大悟，把牛又拉回来。在动员检查和复查时，首先要打破干部自满和干部包庇斗争对象的错误，使其自觉检查。高平区干部到围城检查时，村干部说：“这时来干啥？都斗过了，我村没什么。”后经区干部诱导开展深入检查，才发现了七家封建尾巴和六家未被清算的地主及封建富农。并发现这些遗漏未斗的对象都多少和干部有关系。二、检查和复查的内容必须明确具体，并迅速解决查出的问题。阳城、高平等县根据地委指示的八、九个问题（如是否有封建地主假斗争、假开明、假献田企图逃避斗争等）去检查、复查，群众方向明确，就能辨别是非，查出问题迅速解决，结果就好。三、在检查和复查的方式方法上，主要是挨门挨户的深入访问，发动群众自查，一般大会动员仅是必要的补助办法。这次复查出的封建尾巴大部是和村干部有关系的，不深入便难以发现。（太岳分社）
    【本报太岳十四日电】沁县土地改革现已转入复查阶段，发现运动不彻底的村庄有四种类型：一、对阶级划分不明确，致使封建地主逃避斗争。二、对封建地主认识不足，被地主蒙蔽。过去有些所谓：“善财主”，剥削较为温和机巧，部分群众一时误认他们为“好人”，未进行清算。还有些地主采取化整为零的办法，表面上看，他的土地没有多少了，而忘记其原来的封建剥削，因此迷惑群众一时未能清算。三、执行政策有偏向，损伤了中农；部分地主被干部包庇，反逍遥法外。四、干部没有深入山庄山沟，运动因而没弄彻底。现全县干部正集中力量，分别解决上述问题。此次复查主要经验，是从翻身教育中提高农民的阶级觉悟，提高他们对封建剥削的认识，引导他们自己检查，发现各种不彻底的现象。
