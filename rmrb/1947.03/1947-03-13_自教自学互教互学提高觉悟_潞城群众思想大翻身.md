　　Self-Education, Mutual Education, and Learning from Each Other Raise Awareness
    Lucheng Masses Undergo Great Ideological Transformation
    [Report from this newspaper, Lucheng] The ideological transformation movement in the in-depth stage of the land reform in Lucheng is being carried out with the self-education and mutual education of the emancipated peasants as its fundamental method. Yang Zhaoze, a poor peasant in Dongbao Village, used to believe that poverty was fate, often saying, "A gentleman does not contend with fate." During the ideological transformation movement, the masses guided him to recall his past experiences of exploitation and compared him with Liu Zhaoze, a landlord in the same village: when the Liu family buried his mother, the village was filled with paper money, while he could only wrap his mother in a mat when he buried her. This awakened him to the fact that "not contending with fate" was a deception by the landlords against the peasants, and that he must resolutely struggle against the landlords. Zhang Pangze of Guojiazhuang suffered all his life but was very numb and felt no bitterness. However, when the masses enlightened him by reminding him that he had only worn two pairs of new shoes in his life (one when he got married and one recently after he was emancipated), and that his mother wanted to eat a persimmon before she died but he had no money to buy it, he realized that he had suffered for others all his life and began to hate the old society. Hou Jiazhuang's X Jia Suo used to blame his father for being incompetent. The masses asked him, "Your mother is very capable, why didn't she ever eat a bowl of dry rice in her life?" Then he realized that in the past, he would repair houses for the wealthy as soon as the fifth day of the first lunar month came, delaying his own work, but he never had a house to live in. So he gnashed his teeth and said, "The past society was not our society!" The masses in Li Village compared Chairman Mao with their own parents, saying, "No matter how good our parents are, at most they can keep us from starving to death; Chairman Mao leads us to not only have food and clothing, but also have status and not be bullied and oppressed by the wealthy!"

    As the peasants' awareness increased, the conspiracies of landlords and special agents were exposed. Cheng Xi, a peasant in Zhang Village, reflected that he used to work as a hired hand in the house of the landlord Lu Tianbao, and he was only allowed to eat three "geta" cakes per meal. During the famine year, his mother came to beg for food, and he secretly gave her a bowl of rice soup, but was scolded by the landlord. After liberation, the landlord fed him dumplings overnight and even let him sleep with the landlord's daughter-in-law. He felt that the landlord had become better, so he hid many valuables for him. After reporting these valuables this time, he said, "I violated the landlord's line and shielded the landlord, leaving trouble for everyone and also leaving trouble for myself. I am sorry to the Communist Party and the masses." The peasants in Zhang Village exposed the rumors and threats made by the special agent landlord Zhou Meicheng against him ("Whoever is active, the Central Army will come and kill him"), and regretted that they should not have been his henchmen. He said, "I used to feel sorry for Zhou Meicheng when the masses struggled against him, but today I realize that I was fooled by the special agent." Cui Laiwang of Gaojiazhuang exposed the crimes of eight landlords, saying, "I didn't dare to say it before, but now I understand: I was given a donkey, and the landlord Lu Yungui asked me to take good care of it when he left. They told me to oppose the cadres and make contributions to the 'Central Government.' My backward thinking became a talisman for them! I betrayed Chairman Mao and the people!" He finally said painfully, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You saved me! I was confused for half my life, but today you opened my mind!" From self-education, the masses realized that the past "boxing gyms" and "anti-communist defense corps" were all used by Yan Xishan to use the masses to protect their country; only by joining the People's Liberation Army and the militia can the people protect their own country.

　　自教自学互教互学提高觉悟
    潞城群众思想大翻身
    【本报潞城讯】潞城土地改革深入阶段中的思想大翻身运动，是以翻身农民的自我教育与互相教育为基本方法开展起来的。东包村贫农杨召则以前相信穷是命，时常说：“君子不与命争。”思想翻身运动中，群众诱导他回想以前受剥削的历史，又以本村地主刘召则与他对比：刘家埋他娘时纸絮摆满村，他埋娘时一领席子卷到坟。这一下醒悟到“不与命争”是地主对农民的欺骗，要坚决与地主斗争。郭家庄张胖则受了一辈子罪，但很麻痹，一点也不觉苦。可是当群众启发他想到自己一生只穿过两双新鞋（娶老婆时穿过一双，最近翻了身又穿了一双、他娘临死想吃一颗柿子都没钱买时，他觉悟到自己一生是给人家受了一生，开始恨起旧社会来。侯家庄×家锁以前光埋怨他爹没出息，群众问他：“你娘很能干，为啥也一辈子没吃上一碗干饭？”于是他想到过去一过正月初五就给老财修盖房子，自己活都误了，却一直没房子住，于是切齿痛恨说：“过去的社会就不是咱的社会呀！”李家村群众把毛主席和自己父母来对比说：“父母再好，顶多给咱闹个饿不死；毛主席领导咱不仅有吃有穿，还有了地位，不受老财欺负压迫！”
    由于农民觉悟提高，地主特务的阴谋活动都被揭发出来。张庄农民成喜反省说，他以前在地主路天保家当养工，每顿饭只许吃三个圪塔。灾荒年他娘来讨饭，他偷给娘一碗米汤，还被地主恶骂一顿。解放后，地主连夜给他吃饺子，还让他和地主家媳妇睡觉，他觉的人家变好了，就替人家隐藏许多财物。这次他报出这些财物后说：“我违了地主路线，包庇地主，给大家留祸害，也给我自己留祸害，我对不起共产党和群众。”张庄农民经揭发了特务地主周美成对他的造谣威吓（谁积极中央军过来杀谁），痛悔自己不该给他当狗腿。他说：“以前群众斗争周美成我还心疼他，今天才知道是上了特务的当。”高家庄崔来旺揭发了八个地主的罪恶说：“以前我不敢说，现在我想通了：我分了头驴，地主路云贵走时叫我好好给他把这驴喂上。他们叫我反干部，给“中央”立功，我的落后思想给人家做了护身符！我背叛了毛主席和老百姓！”他最后痛心的说：“毛主席呀！毛主席呀！你可救了我啦！我半辈子糊涂，今天你给我开了窍啦！”群众从自我教育中，认识到过去的“拳房”和“防共保卫团”，都是阎锡山利用群众保他们江山；只有参加人民解放军、参加民兵才是老百姓自己保自己的江山。（振萍、＠富、桂芳）
