    Taihang Third Sub-district Militia Factory Competes in Production
    Studies Technical Tool Improvements
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Taihang Third Sub-district Militia Factory is enthusiastically engaged in a production competition, achieving significant results in the past half-month. Tool Department artisans Yang Shulin and Cui Wuce successfully created a grinding wheel, with its effectiveness nearly matching that of foreign goods. The bomb completion team of sixteen people produced 118 pieces of work in six days, increasing production quantity by 31 percent. Huang Changfu, a young worker in the small cannonball team, previously drilled 60 small holes in the steel rods of cannonball tails each day. With the start of the merit campaign, he planned to drill 70 per day, and over the past six days, he has drilled 100, exceeding his self-set plan by 42 percent and exceeding the administrative plan by 66 percent. Nitre extractor Jin Huaisuo proposed picking his own firewood for nitre refining, aiming to save over 200 catties of coal each day. Under the slogan "Study today, use tomorrow," all departments in the factory are enthusiastically studying technology and improving tools. Many workers are currently researching foot-operated double scissors and silk reeling machines, and are contemplating self-manufacturing gauze.
