Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Jin Sui News: People in Yan Xishan's ruling area are on the verge of death. Even the puppet Yangqu County council recently submitted a document to the Shanxi Provincial Government stating: "Since the autumn harvest of last year, people have mostly been filling their stomachs with grass roots and wild vegetables, and using麻袋 (woven hemp bags) as clothing." According to Taiyuan newspapers, the reason for this tragic situation is that, in addition to the Yan army directly robbing the people of food, Yan Xishan's "Shanxi Provincial Grain Procurement Committee" collects as much as 10 to 20 catties of grain per household per month in the narrow Jinzhong ruling area. If farmers slightly argue, they are falsely accused of being "bandits," immediately arrested and tortured. Farmers are forced to sell land, livestock, wives, and daughters to pay for the grain. Furthermore, due to Yan Xishan's implementation of the military-agricultural integration tyranny, conscription is rampant everywhere, and there are no young adults left in the countryside. At present, spring plowing is impossible.

　　阎锡山统治区人民奄奄待毙
    【新华社延安十六日电】晋绥讯：阎锡山统治区人民已奄奄待毙，其御用阳曲县参会近呈文山西省府亦称：“自去年秋收以来，人民多以草根野菜果腹，麻袋为衣。”造成此种惨状之原因，据太原报纸透露，除阎军直接抢劫民间食粮外，阎锡山之“晋省军粮筹购委员会”，在狭小的晋中统治区每户每月征粮达一、二十斤，农民略有争辩，即被诬为“土匪”，立予拘捕和拷打，农民被迫出卖土地牲畜妻女交粮者比比皆是。再由于阎锡山实行兵农合一暴政，到处抓丁，农村壮年绝迹，目前春耕已无法进行。
