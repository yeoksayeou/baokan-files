    Changzhi Central Agricultural and Forestry Bureau
    Rewards Tree Planting
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 20th] The Changzhi Central Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has recently formulated the following measures for this year's tree planting: 1. Preparatory work: train technical personnel for tree planting and organize tree planting leadership structures. Each village should organize a village road tree planting committee, responsible for leading roadside afforestation within its jurisdiction. 2. Work implementation: Before tree planting, the tree planting committee will divide the roads under its jurisdiction into sections, and then divide the tree planting masses into groups according to section. Most of the saplings will be supplied by the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's Guancun Nursery. The administrative offices and special commissioner's offices will stipulate measures to protect the nurseries on both sides of the road. In the autumn, the special commissioner's office and the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau will jointly inspect the roads along with the county's tree planting guidance committee. Those with a survival rate of 90% or more will be rated first-class, 80% or more will be rated second-class, and 70% or more will be rated third-class. All first, second, and third-class villages will receive rewards, while those below 60% will be criticized. Rewards and evaluations will be based on villages, with a total bonus of 50,000 yuan.
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The technical training class held by the Taihang Changzhi Central Agricultural and Forestry Bureau concluded on the 3rd of this month. Participants included construction staff, production directors, and technical experts from counties such as Changzhi and Licheng, totaling more than 100 people. They deeply studied tree planting, afforestation, animal husbandry, cotton field management, insect pests, and the three major crops, and everyone's learning enthusiasm was very high. Liu Jubao, a technical expert from Lucheng, voluntarily led students to the forest to learn tree planting techniques. Zhang Ge, a more than sixty-year-old indigo dyeing expert from Guzhang, promoted and studied techniques, and personally traveled a long distance to explain indigo dyeing techniques to everyone. They made specific preparations for spring plowing, formulated tree planting and afforestation and nursery work plans, and decided to go back to organize a county-wide spring plowing preparation movement.
