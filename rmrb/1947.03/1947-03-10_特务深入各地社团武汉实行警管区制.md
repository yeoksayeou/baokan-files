The Changchun Kuomintang city authorities have decided to implement joint guarantee and collective liability grouping from the 20th to the 26th. Each "jia" will be composed of five to ten households, divided into several units of collective liability. After the grouping is completed, a joint guarantee and collective liability pledge will be processed. It is stipulated that anyone who "colludes with bandits," privately hides military supplies, or discovers the above-mentioned circumstances and fails to report them, all households signing the joint guarantee and collective liability pledge will be subject to equal punishment.
