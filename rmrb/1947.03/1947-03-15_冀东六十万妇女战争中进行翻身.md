Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 11th - Sixty thousand organized women in eastern Hebei are participating in the land reform movement during lulls in the self-defense war, becoming a magnificent army in the struggle against the enemy and in land reform. During the liquidation of the local tyrant landlord Li Xiangchen in Linmu Village, Linyu, more than a thousand women from a dozen villages poured out their grievances at the meeting, accusing the local tyrant Li Xiangchen of privately establishing a public hall in his home, raping the sixteen-year-old girl Chen Xiaolian, and extorting money from the masses. This aroused strong class hatred among the people present. They unanimously demanded that Li Xiangchen pay for the death of the victim and return the land he had seized to its original owners, liberating many women who had been occupied by Li. Women played a leading role in this movement. For example, women in a village in Funing accused the village's local tyrant monk landlord of raping women and exploiting tenant farmers. Women who had been raped by him came to the meeting to accuse him. As a result, the monk admitted his mistakes and used land to repay his blood debt. In the liquidation movement in Xitaierzhuang, Changli, poor peasant women were extremely active. More than 200 people participating in the struggle were very determined under the leadership of the Women's Federation. Old women, seeing that this was truly a time for women's liberation, all let their daughters-in-law participate in the Women's Federation. A woman in her seventies, leaning on crutches, asked to join the Women's Federation. She said excitedly, "I have been oppressed all my life, and this time I also want to be liberated." During the land reform in the eighth district of Baodi, more than 2,000 women from fifteen villages directly participated in the struggle. Chang Xiuying and An Suzhen, women from Dapu Ying, Changli, led the masses to settle accounts with the landlord puppet township chief. More than 170 women participated. Before the fruits were completely distributed, the puppet township chief colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's puppets to arrest An Suzhen and Chang Xiuying. An Suzhen said to her father, "If my brothers are here, they can take revenge. At most, I'll die, what am I afraid of?" When she arrived at Chiang's stronghold, when the enemy asked her, she said righteously, "They oppress people, so we must fight them!" And shouted, "Without the Communist Party, there would be no China."

　　冀东六十万妇女战争中进行翻身
    【新华社晋察冀十一日电】冀东六十万有组织的妇女在自卫战争的间隙中参加土地改革运动，成为对敌斗争与土地改革中一支雄伟的大军。清算临榆林母村恶霸地主李向辰时，十几个村庄的千余妇女在大会上吐苦水，控诉恶霸李向辰家中私立公堂，强奸十六岁的女孩陈小莲，污辱敲诈群众等事实，激起到会群众强烈的阶级仇恨，一致要求李向辰为死者抵命，将霸地归还原主，解放被李霸占之妇女很多。妇女在这次运动中起了带头作用，如抚宁一村妇女控诉该村恶霸和尚地主奸淫妇女剥削佃户的罪恶，曾被其强奸过的妇女都赶来大会控诉，结果和尚认错，拿出土地偿还血债。昌黎西台儿庄在清算运动中，贫农妇女异常积极，参加斗争的二百余人在妇联会领导下非常坚决，老妇女看到这回真是妇女求解放，都让自家的媳妇参加妇联会。一个七十多岁的老太婆撑着拐杖要求参加妇联会，她兴奋地说：“我受了一辈子压迫，这回也要求解放。”宝坻八区土地改革中，十五个村庄直接参加斗争的妇女有二千余人。昌黎大蒲应妇女常秀英、安素贞，领导群众向地主伪乡长算账，参加的妇女一百七十多人，在果实未分完时，伪乡长勾结蒋伪把安素贞、常秀英捉去，安素贞对他父亲说：“有我兄弟在就能报仇，我顶多是个死，怕啥。”到了蒋据点，敌人问她时，她理直气壮地说：“他们压迫人就要斗他！”并高呼：“没有共产党就没有中国。”
