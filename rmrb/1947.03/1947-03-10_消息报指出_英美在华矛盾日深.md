The News Bulletin Points Out
Anglo-American Contradictions in China Deepening
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] The News Bulletin published an article by Yarovos on the 2nd, entitled "Britain and China," which stated: As a result of Japanese aggression and the increasing activities of the United States, Britain's influence in China has been greatly reduced. The collusion between British "shou gong" (telegraph code missing digits) American capitalists and the Kuomintang leadership, and the large-scale assistance to the Chinese reactionaries in carrying out anti-democratic struggles, have actively gained economic and political positions in China. Britain has tried to reach an economic agreement with the United States, but American capitalists have rejected Britain's requests. Not only that, but they have even instigated China to obstruct Britain's actions to restore its superior position in some cases. The author continued: In the second half of 1946, Britain began intense activities in China, most of which were aimed at the United States. Britain strives to restore its original leading position in China's foreign trade. The British attempt to make Hong Kong the base for Britain's expansion of its influence in South China. To this end, Britain has won over a considerable portion of compradore capital to Hong Kong, using their help to establish many companies in Guangdong. They are also planning to open power plants and textile factories with Sino-British capital and British technical assistance. The author pointed out that in order to counter Britain's plans, the United States formed the so-called "Sino-American Industrial Company" in China. An important thing for Britain in the struggle to win its position in China is the conclusion of a trade agreement, which has been under negotiation for six years. According to British reports, there are serious differences between China and Britain in the negotiations. These newspapers said that the Chinese government's refusal to accept the British terms was mostly instigated by the United States. The author concluded: The sharpness of Anglo-American contradictions in China, although temporarily缓和 mitigated because Britain adopted a policy of cooperation with the United States on international issues, will become larger and deeper in scale as American forces invade all aspects of Chinese life. These contradictions may therefore become more tense in the future.

　　消息报指出
    英美在华矛盾日深
    【新华社延安七日电】消息报二日刊载雅罗沃斯所作题为《英国和中国》一文，略称：由于日本侵略和美国活动日增的结果，英国于中国的势力是大为减低了，英国在中国的首公（电码脱数字）美国资本家与国民党领导集团的勾结，和大规模帮助中国反动派进行反民主的斗争，已积极取得在中国的经济政治地位。英国曾试图与美国求得经济上的协议，可是美国资本家拒绝英国的请求。不仅如此，他们在好些场合甚至挑唆中国阻碍英国为恢复其优越地位之行动。作者继称：一九四六年下半年英国在中国开始激烈的活动，此种行动大部分是对付美国的，英国力求在中国对外贸易上恢复原有的居于首要的地位。英人图使香港成为英国在华南伸张势力的根据地，为此目的英国已争取相当一部分买办资本到香港，利用他们的帮助在广东设立了好多公司。他们还筹划取用中英资本和英国技术上的帮助开设电力厂和纺织厂。作者指出为对抗英国的计划，美国在华组成了所谓“中美实业公司”。英国在争取在华地位的斗争中，重要的一件事就是缔结商约问题，该约六年以来即在谈判之中，根据英国报载称：谈判中中英双方严重的分歧，这些报纸说，中国政府之拒绝接受英方条款大部分为美国所策动。作者结语称：英美在华矛盾的尖锐性，虽因英国在国际问题上采取与美合作政策而缓和一时，但是在美国势力侵入中国生活各方面之后，规模将愈大愈深，这些矛盾今后因之可能愈趋于紧张。
