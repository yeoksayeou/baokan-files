　　The Main Roads Need Repairing
    To the Editorial Comrade:
    The cart is the most important tool in our liberated area's transportation work. Now, because the cart roads and bridges are broken and have not been repaired, it is very inconvenient for carts to travel. For example, the Handan-Changzhi cart road, from Yuquanling in Wu'an to Henandian in Shexian, is really difficult to travel. From Henandian in Shexian downwards, it is common to see carts pulling other carts, or carts destroyed by the roadside, or carts being repaired on the road. The distance from Nanguan in Shexian to Henandian is only half a li, but because the bridge is broken, overturned carts, broken axles, and destroyed cart wheels are seen almost every day. The destruction of goods and the loss of property are countless. Therefore, I believe that repairing this section of the cart road is a matter of great urgency. If it is repaired in time, public and private vehicles, livestock, and goods will suffer less damage, which will both cherish the manpower and material resources of the liberated area and ensure the supply to the front lines. I hope that comrades in charge of transportation departments will take my opinion into consideration.

### 大车路须要修理

　　大车路须要修理编辑同志：
    大车是我们解放区运输工作上最主要的工具，现在由于车道桥梁破烂，未加修理，大车行走实为不便。如邯长大车路，自武安玉泉岭至涉县河南店一段，实属难走，自涉县河南店住下走常见有车拉车的，或毁于路旁的，或在路上修车的。涉县南关至河南店只有半里之遥，由于桥梁坏了，致使翻车，折轴，毁车轮者几乎日有所见，毁货物、损资财不知凡几。所以我认为修整这一段车路是刻不容缓的一件大事。如果及时修整了，公私车辆和牲口货物都少受损失，既爱惜了解放区的民力物力，又保证了前线的供给。我这个意见，请负责交通部门的同志参考。
