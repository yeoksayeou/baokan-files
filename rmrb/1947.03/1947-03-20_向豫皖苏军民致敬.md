　　A Salute to the Military and Civilians of the Yu-Wan-Su Region

　　The heroic military and civilians in the Yu-Wan-Su region behind enemy lines have once again crushed Chiang's army's "mopping-up" operation. This "mopping-up" offensive by Chiang's army against Yu-Wan-Su was of a very large scale, deploying as many as seven brigades and lasting for more than a month. However, the military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su, united in their efforts and actively fighting, continuously dealt powerful blows to the invading Chiang's army, recovering the city of Suixian County, and finally winning a complete victory in the anti-"mopping-up" campaign, defending the strategic base behind enemy lines. The military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su have stood the test, and we extend our highest respect to the military and civilians of the region!

　　The military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su have grown stronger and developed in the midst of arduous struggles. From Japanese imperialism to the Chiang-American reactionaries, they have never ceased their efforts to eliminate them. After the January 13th ceasefire order last year, Chiang Kai-shek called them "bandits," refused to recognize them as liberated areas, and repeatedly "mopped up" and besieged them. In the past year, Chiang Kai-shek has launched major offensives more than five times, and small-scale offensives have been almost uninterrupted. However, the military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su have fought tirelessly, not only crushing the repeated "mopping-up" and "encirclement and suppression" operations of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries but also, in the past six months, developing and expanding rapidly, with the base area more than doubling in size, establishing twenty-two county governments, three districts, including a population of more than three million, and building a field army with strong combat effectiveness, creating many brilliant annihilation results. On January 13th this year, in the Longxing annihilation battle in Fengxian County, an entire regiment of the New 10th Brigade of the 58th Division of Chiang's army was wiped out in one fell swoop, setting the best record for local troops annihilating Chiang's regular army this year. They are situated under the heavy blockade and cruel military attacks of the reactionaries, and they can stand behind enemy lines, be self-sufficient, and fight independently. This is the greatest contribution to the cause of people's liberation.

　　Why did the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries organize continuous offensives against the Yu-Wan-Su liberated area and dispatch a large force of seven brigades? There is no other reason than that the existence of the Yu-Wan-Su base area behind enemy lines seriously threatens Chiang's army's strategic bases in Xuzhou and Kaifeng, and the transportation lines of Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan are in danger of being cut off at any time. From Yu-Wan-Su, crossing the New Yellow River to the south (the Yellow River is returning to its old course), or advancing eastward, Chiang's army is a vacuum, and its weaknesses are fully exposed. Chiang Kai-shek has to constantly use seven to nine regular brigades, a massive force of five to six thousand (including miscellaneous troops), to deal with our Yu-Wan-Su military and civilians. The military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su bear the glorious task of coordinating with the main force on the front line to contain a large number of Chiang's troops. Their struggle is the most intense and arduous, and they have achieved the best results in completing their tasks.

　　The victorious struggle of the Yu-Wan-Su military and civilians over the past year has proved that as long as they rely closely on the masses, boldly mobilize the masses, and correctly implement our Party's various policies, base areas behind enemy lines can be completely created and maintained. In the face of the great power of the people, there are no insurmountable difficulties. Despite the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries' best efforts to carry out cruel destruction, they can only make the Yu-Wan-Su military and civilians fight stronger and stronger. The struggle of the Yu-Wan-Su military and civilians also proves that in the cruel guerrilla war, the development of the troops from small to large and from weak to strong is very fast. It can also annihilate a large number of enemy personnel, and under severe blockade, it can also develop independently, autonomously, and self-sufficiently. In particular, it proves that the people in the Chiang-controlled areas are on the verge of being unable to continue living under the rule of the four major families, and once this resistance force is connected with our army, it will quickly become a great anti-Chiang force. Guerrilla warfare in the Chiang-controlled areas can be widely carried out, and it can be quickly created as a people's guerrilla base area. They have provided extremely valuable experience for the self-defense struggle in the entire region.

　　The military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su have not produced any illusions of peace in the environment of fighting Chiang Kai-shek every day. They have no disputes over war and peace, no disputes over cities and villages. They understand that the only way to survive is to fight, to rely on the vast countryside and peasants that can be relied upon, so they are strengthening the battle and strengthening guerrilla warfare every moment. They have no thoughts of urban material enjoyment, and their internal unity is close; their organs are small, and the combat troops are full and adapt to the war environment; they are arduous and simple and can be self-sufficient. This is the basic reason why they have not taken detours and have achieved victory.

　　They never relax their duties, share life and death with the masses, rely closely on the masses, and stick to their positions. This has won the most enthusiastic support of the masses, and the masses' confidence in persisting in the struggle has also been unprecedentedly improved. They believe that they are the sons and soldiers of the people of Yu-Wan-Su and the backing of the people. Therefore, they can overcome all difficulties and stand invincible.

　　They actively and proactively fight the enemy, implement the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance," and do not let go of any opportunity to win. They seek consolidation in development, defend the liberated area by expanding the liberated area, and gain more space by annihilating the enemy's personnel. In this way, their occupied areas are expanding day by day, and the enemy is being pressed into points and lines. They are even more eager to crush any offensive by the reactionaries.

　　In the scattered guerrilla warfare, they appropriately assembled the main force, moved around and maneuvered, looked for the enemy's weaknesses, and suddenly annihilated and attacked them. They only fight battles that they are sure of winning, and they only fight annihilation battles. Every victory has been achieved in this way, such as the sixty-mile rush to capture Woyang City, the two Longxingji annihilation battles, and the annihilation of the pseudo-Henan Provincial Security Regiment in Suixian City. These battles were all won with small casualties.

　　After the severe test of crushing Chiang's army's mopping-up operation by seven brigades, the military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su will be stronger and more consolidated. Even if Chiang's army continues to organize new offensives after its repeated failures, the bright future of the Yu-Wan-Su liberated area is undoubtedly assured. We hope that the military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su will make persistent efforts, seize every possible opportunity, step up land reform, strengthen the construction of the people's armed forces, and strive to organize people's production so that the construction of the base area can be further improved to meet the new victorious situation. We also call on the military and civilians in all areas occupied by the enemy to learn from the spirit of tenacious struggle of the military and civilians of Yu-Wan-Su, strive to render meritorious service to the people, and fight to defeat the invading Chiang's army!

### 向豫皖苏军民致敬

　　向豫皖苏军民致敬
    豫皖苏敌后军民英勇奋战，已于日前再次粉碎蒋军之“扫荡”。此次蒋军对豫皖苏的“扫荡”进攻，规模极大，出动兵力达七个旅之多，时间持续一个月以上。但我豫皖苏军民戮力同心，积极作战，连续给进犯蒋军以有力打击，收复城、睢县，终于赢得反“扫荡”作战的完满胜利，保卫了敌后战略阵地。豫皖苏军民是经得起考验的，我们特向该区军民致以崇高之敬意！
    豫皖苏军民是在艰苦斗争中日益壮大发展起来的，从日本帝国主义到蒋美反动派，没有一天不要消灭他们。去年一月十三日停战令颁发后，蒋介石称他们为“土匪”，不承认他们是解放区，反复的向他们“扫荡”围攻，一年以来，蒋介石大的进攻在五次以上，小规模进攻则几无中断。但豫皖苏军民奋战不懈，不仅粉碎了蒋介石反动派的多次“扫荡”“驻剿”；且半年以来，猛烈发展壮大，根据地扩大一倍以上，建立了二十二个县政权，三个分区，包括人口三百万以上，建设了一支具有顽强战斗力的军区野战军，多次创造了辉煌的歼灭战果。今年一月十三日，枫县龙兴歼灭战斗，一次歼灭蒋军五十八师新十旅一个团，首创今年地方部队歼蒋军正规军之最佳纪录。他们处在反动派重重封锁和军事上残酷攻击之下，能屹立敌后自给自足，独立奋战，这是对人民解放事业最大的贡献。
    为什么蒋介石反动派要对豫皖苏解放区组织连续不断的进攻和出动七个旅的庞大兵力呢？没有别的，只是因为豫皖苏敌后根据地之存在，严重威胁着蒋军徐州、开封两战略基地，津浦、陇海、平汉三线交通有随时被截断之危机。从豫皖苏而南渡过新黄河（黄水正在归故），或向东挺进，蒋军均是一片空虚，弱点毕露，蒋介石不得不经常以七至九个正规旅、五至六万庞大兵力（包括杂军）来对付我豫皖苏军民。豫皖苏军民担负着配合正面主力作战牵制大量蒋军的光荣任务，他们斗争最紧张最艰苦，他们完成任务的成绩也最好。
    一年余来，豫皖苏军民的胜利斗争的证明只要紧紧依靠群众、放手发动群众，正确执行我党的各种政策，敌后根据地是完全可以创建并坚持的。在人民的伟大力量面前，没有不可克服的困难，尽管蒋介石反动派尽其残酷摧残之能事，只能使豫皖苏军民愈战愈强。豫皖苏军民的斗争还证明在残酷的游击战争中，部队由小到大、由弱到强的发展是很快的，它同样可以大量歼灭敌人有生力量，在严重封锁之下，它同样可以独立自主自给自足的发展。特别证明蒋管区人民在四大家族统治之下，已到不能继续生活下去的边沿，此种反抗力量一经与我军衔接，很快会变成伟大的抗蒋力量，蒋管区的游击战争是能够广泛开展的，并可以迅速创立为人民游击根据地，他们给全区自卫斗争提供了极为宝贵的经验。
    豫皖苏军民在每天与蒋介石斗争的环境中没有产生过和平幻想，他们没有战争与和平的争论，没有城市与乡村的争论，他们懂得欲生存只有战斗，只有依靠可以依靠的广大乡村和农民，因而他们没有一时一刻不在加强战斗，加强游击战争。他们没有对城市物质享受的思想，内部紧密团结；他们机关很小，战斗部队充实适应战争环境；他们艰苦朴素，能够自给自足。这是他们没有走弯路，获得胜利的基本原因。
    他们一天也不放松他们自己的职守，和群众同生死共患难，紧紧依靠群众，坚持阵地，这样取得群众最热烈的拥护，群众坚持斗争的信心也空前提高，相信他们是豫皖苏人民的子弟兵，是人民的靠山，因而他们能够突破一切困难，立于不败之地。
    他们积极主动的向敌人斗争，实行敌进我进，敌不进我亦进，不放松一切可以取胜的机会，从发展中求巩固，从扩大解放区来保卫解放区，从歼灭敌人有生力量来取得更大的空间，这样他们的占区日益扩大，敌人被压于点线，他们就更急于粉碎反动派的任何进攻。
    他们在分散的游击战争中，适当的集结了主力，辗转机动，寻找敌人弱点，突然歼灭打击之；他们只打有把握的仗，只打歼灭仗，历次的胜利都是这样取得的，如六十里奔跑攻克涡阳城，两次龙兴集歼灭战，睢县城伪河南省保安团之歼灭等，这些战斗都是以小的伤亡获取全胜。
    豫皖苏军民经过此次粉碎蒋军七个旅扫荡的严重考验以后，将是更加坚强，更加巩固，纵然蒋军于其屡次失败以后，还在继续组织新的进攻，但豫皖苏解放区的光明前途是无疑的。我们希望豫皖苏军民再接再厉，利用一切可能时机，加紧进行土地改革，加强人民武装建设，努力组织人民生产，使根据地建设更加提高一步，以迎接新的胜利形势。我们并号召全区一切渝陷区军民学习豫皖苏军民顽强斗争的精神，努力为人民立功，为击败进犯蒋军而奋斗！
