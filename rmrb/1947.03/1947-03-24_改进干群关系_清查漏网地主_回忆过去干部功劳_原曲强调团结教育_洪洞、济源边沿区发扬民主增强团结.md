    [This Dispatch from Shexian] After land reform, the peasant class in Yuanqu Village, Fifth District of Shexian, generally improved their awareness. Recently, when rectifying relations between cadres and the masses, the masses adhered to the policy of education and unity regarding cadres who had made mistakes, overcoming the individual masses' tendency toward simple attacks. The village's anti-conscription director had been unfair in assigning corvée labor, had secretly exchanged three pairs of good military shoes, and had failed to provide timely preferential treatment to military dependents with firewood stored in the anti-conscription department, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. The leadership, on the one hand, allowed the masses to express their opinions freely in the literacy school, and on the other hand, inspired the cadres to conduct self-criticism. After a thorough reflection, the masses immediately eliminated their dissatisfaction and discussed with him how to give preferential treatment to military dependents and how to do a good job in anti-conscription work in the future. However, Qin Xuezhong and Cui Tianze, two military dependents, still insisted on dismissing him because of personal grudges. Geng Junsheng, a retired soldier, said, "We cannot isolate our own people." Many masses also said, "We cannot treat our own people with the methods used to treat landlords." The opinions finally became consistent. On the 11th of this month, the village held a cadre evaluation conference, and the leadership inspired the masses to recall the history of past struggles against landlords and everyone's contributions. During the discussion, two different opinions emerged. Most of the liberated peasants believed that the cadres had put in efforts when fighting the landlords. For example, Chen Xiangjun stayed up all night last year to lead the liberation, and they all advocated that as long as the cadres can correct their mistakes, they can still be cadres. Qin Decai, Shen Qingxian, and others believed that "cadres work actively for selfishness and should be dismissed." The peasant Li Zongtang opposed, saying, "Cadres get a little more fruit, and you don't allow them to step down? Who doesn't make mistakes?" Zhang Xinzeng said, "You only talk about the bad things about the cadres! If you become one, you won't be as good as them!" Wu三重 said, "If it weren't for their painstaking leadership, would we be like this?" After the debate, the masses felt that the latter few people were "reasonable," and Qin and Shen also understood, and the tendency to simply attack cadres was overcome. Forty-nine cadre models and thirty-six mass models were selected on the spot. (Yuanqu Correspondence Group)

    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 22nd] The border area of Hongdong and Jiyuan is strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses to promote the struggle against the enemy and the land reform. The cadres in Sheng Village, Hongdong, have an undemocratic work style. At the beginning of this mass movement, many masses demanded the removal of cadres. A few saboteurs took the opportunity to provoke and create antagonism between cadres and the masses. When the county discovered this problem, it mobilized these cadres to conduct profound self-criticism and launched a competition to serve the people. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to conduct self-criticism. After the cadres corrected their mistakes, the masses also recognized the contributions of the cadres and their past mistakes. The relationship between cadres and the masses was unprecedentedly harmonious. The number of peasant association members increased from more than 100 to 250, and the armed village government received enthusiastic support and support from the vast masses. In the re-examination of more than 20 villages in the Fifth District of Jiyuan, it was found that the cadres and the masses were not united, resulting in many feudal remnants slipping through the net. For example, the cadres in Zhuyuangou sheltered the landlords, and the activists rose up to oppose them, causing internal disputes. In the re-examination, democracy was promoted from the bottom up, allowing the masses to boldly express their opinions on the cadres. The internal unity was achieved, and the struggle to cut off the feudal tails was carried out victoriously.

    【本报涉县讯】涉县五区原曲村经过土地改革，农民阶级觉悟普遍提高，最近整顿干群关系时，群众对有错误干部坚持教育与团结方针，克服了个别群众单纯打击的偏向。该村抗勤主任平时派差不公，曾偷换过三双好军鞋，又因未能将抗勤部所存的柴及时优待军属，引起群众不满。领导上一面放手让群众到民校里提意见，一面启发干部自我检讨。经过彻底反省后，群众立即消除了不满情绪，和他一块研究以后应如何优抗，如何做好抗勤工作，但军属秦学忠、崔天则二人因与他有私人成见，仍坚持要罢免。荣退军人耿俊升说：“咱们不能孤立自家人。”许多群众也都说：“咱不能用对待地主的办法对待自己人。”意见终于渐趋一致。本月十一日，该村召开干部评选大会，领导上即启发群众回忆过去对地主斗争历史与各人功劳。座谈中，又出现两种不同主张。多数翻身农民认为干部斗争地主时出过力，如陈相君去年领导翻身把眼都熬红了，都主张只要现在干部有过能改，仍可当干部。秦得才、申清贤等则认为：“干部积极工作是为了自私自利，应该撤还两个。”农民李宗唐反对，说：“干部多分些果实，就不许人家退啦？谁没个错呢？”张心增说：“光说人家干部坏！你当上吧！还不如人家哩！”吴三重说：“要不是人家苦心领导，咱就过成这啦？”经过争论，群众都觉得后面这几个人说得“在理”，秦、申二人也想通了，单纯打击干部的偏向遂被克服。当场选出干部模范四十九名，群众模范三十六名。（原曲通讯小组）
    【本报太岳廿二日电】洪洞、济源边沿区加强干群关系，推动对敌斗争与土地改革之进行。洪洞生村干部作风不民主，在此次群众运动开始，许多群众要求撤换干部。少数破坏分子即乘机挑拨，造成干部与群众的对立。县里发现这一问题，即发动这些干部深刻检讨，展开为民立功竞赛。同时发动群众亦自相检讨。干部改正错误后，群众亦认清了干部的功劳和自己过去的不对，干群关系空前融洽，农会会员由一百余人发展至二百五十人，武装村公所得到广大群众热烈的支持和拥护。济垣五区二十余村庄在复查中发现干部与群众不团结，致漏脱封建尾巴甚多。如竹园沟干部包庇地主，积极分子起来反对，闹成内部纠纷。在复查中自下而上的发扬民主，让群众大胆的对干部发表意见，内部团结了，胜利的进行了割封建尾巴斗争。
