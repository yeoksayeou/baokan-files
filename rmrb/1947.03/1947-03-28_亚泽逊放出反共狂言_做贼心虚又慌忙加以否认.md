Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Washington dispatch: Acting U.S. Secretary of State Acheson stated in the U.S. Congress on the 21st that any country controlled by the Communist Party is a threat to the United States, and the United States has an obligation to assist governments and people in these countries who are fighting against the Communist Party. When answering the question raised by the reactionary Congressman Judd, "Why do we ship weapons to Greece to fight the Communists?" Acheson said in a positive tone: "The United States has equipped 36 modern divisions of the Chinese army according to the Lend-Lease Act (in fact, during the time when Hurley and Marshall were stationed in China, the United States had equipped 45 divisions of the Kuomintang army)." Acheson's words confirmed the true intention of the United States to assist Chiang in the civil war. Acheson, feeling guilty, hurriedly denied it on the 22nd after the Associated Press released the aforementioned remarks, saying that he did not say "any country controlled by the Communist Party is a threat to the United States."

    亚泽逊放出反共狂言
    做贼心虚又慌忙加以否认
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】华盛顿消息：美代理国务卿亚泽逊二十一日于美国会中声称：凡有共产党控制之国家，均为对美国之威胁，美国有义务援助这些国家中对抗共产党之政府人民，于其答复反动众议员楚德所提“何以吾人运武器至希腊对共党作战”问题时，亚氏以肯定之语气说：“美国已按照租借法案装备中国现代化军队三十六个师（按实际在赫尔利及马歇尔驻华时期中，美国已装备国民党军四十五个师）”。亚氏此语证实美国助蒋内战之真正意图。亚氏做贼心虚，在合众社传出亚氏上述谈话后，亚氏又慌忙于二十二日加以否认，说没有讲“凡有共产党控制之国家，均为对美国之威胁一语”云。
