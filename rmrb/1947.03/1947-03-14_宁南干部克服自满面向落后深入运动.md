　　Ningnan Cadres Overcome Complacency, Face Backwardness, Deepen the Movement
    [Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 11th] Ningnan is overcoming complacency among cadres and preparing to conduct a review. After the implementation of land reform in the county in the second half of last year, with the exception of seven small villages, more than 120 villages throughout the county carried out liquidation, and land and housing were distributed once. The county and district cadres were very satisfied. Some cadres even gave a thumbs up and said, "Ningnan's work should be the best!" After the Lunar New Year, the masses' morale was low. The county leadership conducted in-depth investigations in Dongwangdong Town and discovered that there were still 15 landlord households with feudal remnants, three extremely poor households with no land to cultivate, and ten poor peasant households with no housing. The village government and militia occupied 44 brick houses, and furniture worth 250,000 yuan was borrowed and not distributed. There were even individual village cadres who sheltered landlords. Based on the above specific materials, discussions were conducted among cadres, and it was reviewed that the reason lay in the serious pride and complacency of the leading cadres, who only saw the achievements, one-sidedly believed in the activists, did not see the shortcomings in the work, did not face backwardness, did not face the extremely poor and poor peasants, and did not further penetrate the masses to distribute the fruits fairly. After this review, village cadres and activists are now being trained to prepare for a thorough review of the emancipation.

　　宁南干部克服自满面向落后深入运动
    【本报冀南十一日电】宁南克服干部自满情绪，准备进行复查。该县去年下半年推行土地改革后，除七个小村外，全县一百二十多个村庄进行了清算，土地房屋分配一次，县区干部都很满意，某些干部伸出大拇指来说：“宁南的工作数这一份了吧。”旧历年过后，群众情绪低落。该县领导上在东汪东镇深入调查。发现还有十五户地主，留有封建尾巴，三户赤贫无地种，十户贫农无房住，而村公所、民兵占砖房四十四间，借用价值廿五万元的家具未分，甚至有个别村干掩护地主。根据以上具体材料，在干部中进行讨论，检讨原因在于领导干部严重的骄傲自满，只看到成绩，片面的相信积极分子，没有看到工作中的缺陷，没有面向落后、面向赤贫贫农，进一步深入群众中去，把果实分配公平。经此检讨，现正集训村干部与积极分子，准备进行翻身大检查。
