    Various Organs Care for Frontline Soldiers
    Launching a Comfort Bag Movement
    Chairman Yang Rong and Secretary-General Sun of the Border Region Government Enthusiastically Participate
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] After Secretary-General Sun of the Border Region Government conveyed the call on the 9th of this month for female comrades to sew comfort bags for "March 8th" International Women's Day, the Border Region Government Club immediately convened a meeting that evening to arrange specific measures for carrying out this work and separately sent letters to various directly affiliated departments and bureaus to respond. In the past week, 65 comfort bags have been received. From Chairman and Vice-Chairman Yang Rong to service personnel, as well as the family members and children of various cadres, all enthusiastically participated. Each batch received is publicly displayed in the dining hall by the club for the masses to judge, a dazzling array of reds, greens, yellows, and whites. In Chairman Yang's comfort bag, besides a small knife and a pen, there is also a copy of "Fear and Courage". Secretary-General Sun sent silk handkerchiefs and chemical thimbles; Chief Zhao, who is in his forties, personally embroidered words on the pockets; twelve-year-old girl Wang Ruyun also embroidered "Sent to the Eighth Route Army Comrades" and her own name on the pocket. Doctor Liu sent a bowl and a spoon, and used her beloved red satin embroidered pillow top to make a bowl cover, which is practical and beautiful, and has won everyone's praise. Comrade Mi Jintang wrote in his letter: "You sweat when driving and fighting, you need towels, you need soap for washing clothes, you need needles and thread for mending clothes, and you need envelopes, stationery and stamps to write home to report your achievements. Then please accept these necessary things!" In the inscriptions and letters on the bags, everyone wrote their hopes and encouragement to the soldiers. Vice-Chairman Rong and Comrade Lu Geng wrote on their light green pockets: "Serving the people and driving away Chiang Kai-shek – the old fox spirit – is the most glorious!" There are also drawings of charging and killing enemies, and aiming with grenades. Comrade Li Liren told the soldiers in his comfort letter that he saves all his supplies except for a set of single clothes and a pair of socks and shoes issued by the government each year, totaling 369 jin of millet; and he turns in 200 jin of millet to the public from his spare time production to support the front lines. What he gave to the frontline soldiers was a pocket made of white cloth saved last year and his cherished notebook. All the comfort bags have now been handed over to the Political Department of the Military Region for transfer to the front. (Qi Zhi)
    [Another Dispatch] The Border Region Trade General Bureau and the Peace Hospital also enthusiastically responded to the "March 8th" International Women's Day call. Every comrade cares about the brave warriors fighting hard on the front lines and put their own towels, toothbrushes and other daily necessities into the comfort bags they sewed themselves. The Trade General Bureau said in a letter to the Border Region Government Club: "Before receiving your notice, all comrades in the agency, under the concern of the frontline commanders and fighters, have become a spontaneous movement to comfort the army. After the comrades saw your notice, it further promoted the universality of this movement. In just three to five days, 42 comfort bags and 7,000 silver dollars have been collected…." The Peace Hospital is using a "one-item movement" to comfort the frontline soldiers, and 33 comfort bags have been received, all of which have been handed over to the Border Region Government Club for transfer to the Political Department.
