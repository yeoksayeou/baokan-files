Mobilizing Poor and Hired Peasants: Fencao峪 Overturns Its Fate

Fencao峪 was a notoriously backward village in the East Yao District of Lin County. Since Linnan was liberated in 1944, although it had undergone several struggles, such as anti-local tyrant, anti-spy, and reasonable burden, the masses had not been mobilized. The three landlord households of Ren Fulong, Ren Futian, and Ren Fuceng in the village reduced the target of struggle by dispersing land (selling a small amount of bad land and keeping the good land) and dividing the family (Ren Fu'an's thirteen family members were divided into four families). Landlord Ren Fuceng and others even used 150 silver dollars to win over and buy off cadres, and planted their henchman, the security chief and secretary Wu Wenbin, into the government to control all the village's accounts. Later, even landlord Ren Fulong, under the guise of "activism," infiltrated and became a member of the people's education committee. Wang Hongjun, the political director and other cadres, who were very active and resolute in the struggle against the enemy, did not break with the landlords, and said that the landlords' thinking had changed. When other villages were engaged in struggle, the poor and hired peasants in this village wanted to make suggestions, but the cadres said, "Let's consider it." Ren Gengsan, an active poor peasant, made a suggestion to the landlord: "I borrowed a *dou* of fried noodles from you in the past, and I repaid three *dou* of rice!" But he was stopped by political director Wang Hongjun.

During this in-depth land reform movement, the district decided to send Comrade Li Yingtang to Fencao峪, and he immediately ran into a brick wall. The landlords instigated the cadres to resist him. Political director Wang Hongjun initially even hid in the South Mountain. As a result, the masses dared not approach Li Yingtang. Although Comrade Li felt it was very difficult, he firmly remembered one thing: "Only by facing the backward and mobilizing the poor and hired peasants can feudalism be eliminated." Because at that time, the Chiang Kai-shek army occupied Shijia溝, which was only a dozen *li* away from Fencao峪, he led the militia to protect the masses and persisted in the struggle on the border areas. At the same time, he went directly into the ranks of the poor and hired peasants, lived in dilapidated houses, slept with two poor and hired peasant militiamen, and publicly promoted the land-to-the-tiller policy to the masses. He said to the masses: "I am here this time to help everyone overturn their fate. I will not only approach the cadres, but also approach everyone!" The masses, who had suffered from poverty and had no place to voice their grievances, felt relieved when they heard this, but they were still half-convinced. Li Yingtang then brought together those two poor and hired peasant militiamen to form a group of seven people, which later grew to thirty people. The poor and hired peasants came together, and their grievances were endless, and the more they told, the more there were. In this village of less than 160 households, there were 21 poor peasant households, 12 famine refugee households (lower-middle peasants or extremely poor), and 38 hired laborers who had not been liberated. Li Fulai, who had worked as a hired laborer for twelve years, still had no house to live in. Ren Fuchang, who had been a hired laborer all his life, and his family of five covered themselves with a tattered quilt. In the beginning, the newly awakened poor and hired peasants unanimously demanded that the cadres be replaced and that the fruits they had gained in the past during the reasonable burden and other struggles be returned. At this time, everyone was guided to analyze who was the root cause of the cadres going bad? "It is the landlords, they bribed and won over the cadres in order to cover themselves!" And the slogan "Tenants look for landlords, hired laborers look for masters, and maids look for the master's wife, so that everyone can have land to cultivate and food to eat. Just urging the cadres (to give opinions) will not overturn your fate" was put forward. They were divided into tenant, hired laborer, women, and middle peasant groups to unite and tell their grievances, and discuss what crimes they had suffered since birth. Li Fulai said: "I have been a *hanmen* (hired laborer) for twelve years, and my wife worked as a cook for the landlord. That year, I was digging a well for the master and broke my leg. The landlord fired me and forced my whole family to beg for food, and people fled from starvation!" The poor and hired peasants analyzed as they complained. Li Fulai said: "I ate well in the landlord's house. Once I heard the landlord man say to his wife: 'Let him eat better, we fool his belly, and he fools our land.' He asked me to eat well in order to do more work for him, but when I broke my leg, he drove me out!" The wife of Ren Xuecheng in the women's group said that her husband had been a long-term worker all his life, and she had begged for food for fifteen years. The landlord, Ren De, would rather feed the rice to the dog than give it to her. A maid complained that when she was working in the landlord's house, she was beaten on the head during the day, and when she was pinched at night, she cried bitterly, and everyone in the audience also cried.

Once the poor and hired peasants were mobilized, their enthusiasm and wisdom were brought into play. While complaining, they led the cadres to their homes to see for themselves. When the cadres saw that the houses where the poor and hired masses lived were open to the sky, with only straw mats on the floor and winnowing fans as covers, their fighting spirit and enthusiasm also increased. The masses and cadres also visited the homes of Ren Fulong and other landlords, and saw that the landlord's grain was rotten, the silver dollars were rusted, and there was still half a bucket of leftover food. The masses said: "We have nothing to eat, and he has leftovers that rot!" After four days of complaining, they launched a struggle to settle accounts with the landlords. During the struggle, the two large jars of rice that had rotted into ashes from landlord Ren Fulong were taken out for exhibition, and their exploitative accounts were read door-to-door, and even the middle peasants gnashed their teeth in hatred. At this time, the cadres also actively participated in the struggle, and voluntarily confessed to the masses every night, telling everything they had done to embezzle and protect the landlords. The farmers' association also specifically discussed: "Why are Suo Baochang and Little Monk so active in giving opinions on cadres, but not active in struggling against the landlords?" They discovered the landlord's conspiracy to use henchmen to provoke and sabotage the mass movement, which further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. The property that the landlords had tried to disperse was "clarified," and 128 *mu* of land, 125 rooms, 13 head of livestock, 5,000 *jin* of grain, 2,000 silver dollars, and many other clothes and valuables were recovered. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, the poor and hired masses said: "We also have houses and land, and the cadres have also changed, so there is no need to return the fruits. Just don't be careless in the future!" They also said: "The cadres have also suffered a lot! Didn't the director of the farmers' association starve his child to death? They were caught in the landlord's trap, and they have to change in the future!" They proposed "Everyone is responsible for distributing the fruits" "There are two families in the world, one is the landlord, living in buildings and tile houses, and the other is the poor, living in cold kilns! Today, we have to get the things back, and everyone will discuss and distribute them together." First, the houses and land were leveled and made up for, and then whatever was lacking was made up for. Finally, the silver dollars and clothes were rationally distributed according to men and women. The masses reflected: "A few days ago, the landlords didn't know that they would be struggled against to this extent. They thought that Fencao峪 was backward and couldn't do anything. Who knew that if we poor people worked hard together, we would overturn our fate!"

　　面向落后发动贫雇
    芬草峪翻了身
    芬草峪是林县东姚区过去有名的落后村，自从一九四四年林南解放以来，虽说也经过反恶霸、反特务、合理负担等几次斗争，群众并未发动起来。村里任福龙、任福田、任福曾等三户地主，以分散土地（把少数坏地卖了，留好地）、分家（任福庵十三口人便分成了四家）等方法减小斗争目标。地主任福曾等更以一百五十块现洋拉拢收买干部，并粕他们的狗腿保长书记吴文彬打入政权，掌握全村账目，后来连地主任福龙也以“积极”面貌，混进来当民教委员。在对敌斗争中很积极、坚决的政治主任王宏军等干部，因没和地主撕破情面，都说地主思想转变啦。别村闹斗争，本村贫雇群众想提意见，干部说：“考虑考虑吧。”积极贫农任更三向地主提意见：“我过去借你一斗炒面，还三大斗米！”但被政治主任王宏军阻止了。
    这次深入土地改革运动，区上决定李英塘同志到芬草峪，一去就碰了个大钉子。地主怂恿着干部抵抗他，政治主任王宏军开头也躲到南山上去了，群众因此不敢接近李英塘。李同志虽然感到很辣手，可是心里有的，他牢牢地记住一条：“只有面向落后，发动贫雇，才能消灭封建。”因为那时蒋军占领了史家沟，离芬草峪才十几里，他便一面带领着民兵，掩护群众坚持边地斗争，同时还直接深入到贫雇里去，住在破房子里，跟两个贫雇民兵睡在一起，又在群众面前公开宣传耕者有其田的土地政策，他对群众说：“俺这次是来帮助大家翻透身，俺不光接近干部，更要接近大家！”受尽穷困有苦没处诉的群众，听到这一说，心头舒展了，但是仍半信半疑。李英塘便和那两个贫雇民兵团拢了七个人，后来又发展成三十个，贫雇来到一头，苦是诉不完的，越诉越多。这个不满一百六十户的村庄，就有二十一户贫农、十二户逃荒户（下贫农或赤贫）、卅八个雇工没翻身，当了十二年雇工的李福来，现在还没有房子住。当了一辈子雇工的任福昌，五口人盖一床破被。开始，新起来的贫雇都一致要求调换干部，抽出他们过去在合理负担等斗争中多得的果实。这时便引导大家分析干部变坏的老根是谁？“是地主，他收买拉拢干部是为了掩护自己！”并提出“佃户找地主，雇工找主家，使女找主家老婆，才能人人有地种有饭吃，光给干部上劲（提意见）翻不了身”的口号。分成佃户、雇工、妇女、中农小组，进行团拢诉苦，讨论自己生来受过啥罪？李福来说：“俺住了十二年汉们（雇工），俺家女人给地主当掌锅。那年俺给主家打井，跌折了腿，地主把俺开隔了，逼得俺全家讨饭、飘人也给饿跑了！”贫雇农随诉苦随分析。李福来说：“俺在地主家吃的也不错。有一次听到地主男人跟他老婆说：‘叫他吃好点吧，咱哄他肚皮，他哄咱地皮。’叫俺吃好点是为了给他多做活，到俺跌折腿就把俺赶出来！”妇女组任雪成老婆说，她男人住一辈子长工，她要了十五年饭，地主任德把饭喂了狗也不愿意给她。一个使女诉到她在地主家里做活，白天骑在头上打，晚上拧她时，痛哭流涕，全场的人也都哭起来了。
    贫雇农民一经发动，热情与智慧都发挥出来了。他们在诉苦当中，把干部引到自己家里看看，干部一见到贫雇群众住的房子露着天，铺的光席子，盖的簸箕，斗争性积极性也提高了。群众和干部又到任福龙等几户地主家里参观，见到地主的粮食烂了，银元锈了，还有半桶剩饭，群众说：“咱没吃的，他剩下烂了！”诉了四天苦，接着便向地主展开斗争清算。在斗争中，把地主任福龙的两大缸烂成灰的米拿出来展览，把他们的剥削账挨门挨户的念，连中农群众也恨得咬牙切齿。干部此时也积极参加斗争，每天晚自动找群众坦白，把所有贪污包庇地主的事都说出来了。农会里还专门讨论：“索保昌、小和尚为啥提干部意见积极、斗地主不积极？”发现地主利用狗腿挑拨破坏群运的阴谋，更密切了干民关系。把地主极力分散的财产“澄”出来，收回土地一二八亩、房子一二五间、牲口一三头、粮食五千斤，现洋二千元，其他衣服内财很多。分配斗争果实时，贫雇群众说：“咱也有房也有地啦，干部也转变啦，不用退果实了，以后别马虎就行！”又说：“干部也受过大罪呀！农会主任不是饿死了小孩吗？他们上了地主的圈套了，往后可得改改！”提出“分果实大家负责”“天下有两家人，一家是地主，住楼房瓦舍，一家是穷人，住寒窑！咱今天把东西得回来，一家人商商量量来分。”先把房和地填平补齐，其他是缺啥补啥，最后把现洋和衣服按男女合理分配了。群众反映说：“前些日子，地主可不知道斗到他这个地步，以为咱芬草峪落后就干不起来，谁知道咱穷人合伙努一把力，便翻了身！”
