    [Reported from Jiluyu on the 28th] The Chiang troops continue to shell the north bank of the Yellow River, creating floods. On the 23rd, the 72nd Division of the Chiang troops concentrated its shelling on the dikes in Zhonggudui, Yangji, Weili, Sijie Village, Yihezhuang, and other places north of Yuncheng, destroying the dikes along a forty-li stretch. The Yellow River water immediately burst through the breaches. Our Yellow River Commission led civilians to rush to the rescue, but they were met with shelling from the Chiang troops.
    [Reported from Jiluyu on the 28th] The water level in the old course of the Yellow River continues to rise sharply. On the 23rd, the water surface was two meters higher than on the 18th (the message about Chiang's creation of the Yellow River disaster carried by this newspaper on the 28th mistakenly stated "the river water has generally risen by twenty meters"; it should have said "twenty decimeters"), and the water surface was now 600 to 800 meters wide, with a sediment content of 7%. The old river channel has been completely submerged. The riverbank at Liqiao in Puyang County has been eroded and widened by six meters and extended by three meters. Seven new villages in Fan County, including Qiuzhuang and Guanyintang, have been submerged. In addition, the Yellow River water has reached the edge of forty-five other villages, and the masses in each village are urgently relocating with the assistance of our democratic government.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 27th: The rolling Yellow River flowing into the Bohai Sea liberated areas has now seen its water level rise from fifty centimeters to four meters, with a width of seven hundred meters, and continues to rise. The sudden arrival of the Yellow River water has made it impossible for residents on both banks to defend against it, even with day and night repairs. Dangerous projects in Zhangxinzhuang (under Jiyang), Sujia (under Yangzhong County), and Wujia Yang (under Huimin) are in imminent danger. The reporter saw along the river that the torrential river water swept away wood, firewood, and house doors, panels, and furniture, rolling eastward. Residents on the shore cursed the Chiang bandits while trying to salvage their lost property. A total of 170,000 mu of riverbed fertile land has been submerged in the entire area, including large areas of wheat fields that were expected to yield a good harvest. At present, the democratic government is leading the masses in fighting against the Chiang bandits' harassment and the Yellow River water. It is reported that since Chiang Kai-shek arbitrarily closed the breach at Huayuankou and carried out the confluence, the Yellow River water flowed into the territory of Jiyang County in the Bohai Sea liberated area on the 15th, reached the territory of Yangzhong County (a new county located between Huimin and Shanghe) on the 16th, reached the territory of Huimin County on the 18th, reached the territory of Qingcheng and Huantai Counties on the 20th, reached the territory of Bin County and Lijin County on the 21st, and flowed into the Bohai Sea from the territory of Kenli County on the 24th.

    兽军继续炮轰黄河北岸
    蒋造黄灾猛烈扩大
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】蒋军继续炮击黄河北岸，制造水灾。二十三日，蒋军七十二师向我郓城北面仲固堆、杨集、韦里、四杰村、义和庄等处堤岸集中轰击，长达四十里的大堤悉被轰毁，黄水随即冲出缺口。我黄委会率领民夫赶往抢救，复遭蒋军炮轰。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】黄河故道水势继续猛涨，二十三日之水面已较十八日高出二公尺（二十八日本报所载蒋造黄灾消息中“河水普遍上涨二十公尺”为“二十公寸”之误），水面已宽达六百至八百公尺，含沙量百分之七。旧日河身已全被淹没。濮县李桥河岸被冲刷坍宽六公尺、长三公尺。范县之邱庄、观音堂等七个新村已被淹没。另有四十五个村，黄水已逼至村边，各村群众正在我民主政府协助下，紧急迁移。
    【新华社山东廿七日电】流入渤海解放区之滚滚黄流现水位已由五公寸涨至四公尺，宽达七百公尺，并继续高涨中。此次黄水突然到来，两岸居民虽昼夜抢修，亦不及防御。张辛庄（济阳属）、苏家（杨忠县属）、五甲杨（惠民属）等处险工岌岌可危。记者沿河看到滔滔河水席卷木料柴草与房屋门板家具，滚滚东去，岸上居民一面咒骂蒋贼，一面努力抢捞失去财物。全区被淹没之河床良田达十七万亩，其中并有可望丰收的大片麦田。现民主政府正率领群众冒蒋机袭扰与黄水搏斗。按自蒋介石在花园口堵口擅行合龙后，黄水于十五日即流入渤海解放区济阳县境，十六日流至杨忠县（新县位惠民、商河之间）境，十八日至惠民县境，廿日至青城、桓台县境，廿一日至滨县、利津县境，二十四日由垦利县境流入渤海。
