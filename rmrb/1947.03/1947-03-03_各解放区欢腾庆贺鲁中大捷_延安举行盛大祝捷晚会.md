Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Comprehensive news from various locations indicates that the great victory in Central Shandong has sparked jubilation throughout the liberated areas. Newspapers everywhere released special editions or spread the news via telephone. The military and civilians in Yan'an held meetings to celebrate. Yesterday, the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region Assembly Hall hosted a grand victory celebration evening. The CCP Northwest Central Bureau, the Border Region Government, and the Joint Defense Army Headquarters and Political Department sent telegrams to Generals Chen Yi and Su Yu to express their congratulations. When the news reached Qiqihar, a rally of several thousand people was held that day. A sign in front of a paper store read, "Everyone is happy about the victory. We don't charge for paper to write victory reports." In Harbin, as a female student read the special edition aloud in the street, the crowd gathered and cheered and applauded continuously. After hearing the news, three wounded soldiers from a recuperation center in the Huaihai District returned to their units without the doctor's permission. Many other wounded soldiers also requested immediate discharge from the hospital. The CCP Central Bureau of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, the Border Region Government, and the military and political leaders of Taiyue, Taihang, and Jinnan sent telegrams of congratulations.

Our Special Dispatch: The Border Region Government and the Border Region Assembly recently sent a telegram to the headquarters of the East China Military Region, Generals Chen and Su, and all commanders and fighters, congratulating them on the unprecedented great victory in East China, stating:

We are delighted to hear that after defeating the enemy in Southern Shandong, you have achieved another great victory in Central Shandong, annihilating a vast number of enemies and seizing an unprecedented amount of equipment. This has chilled the reactionary ambitions of the tyrant and suppressed the arrogance of the evil forces. Your achievements are magnificent and your power shakes the universe. The impact of this victory will inevitably further shake the dark rule in the KMT-controlled areas and further consolidate the confidence in victory in the liberated areas. We hereby send our congratulations and express our condolences on behalf of the 30 million people in this region.

Our Taihang, 1st: Upon hearing of the great victory in Shandong, the military and civilians throughout the Taihang region were overjoyed and eagerly spread the news, causing all telephone lines in the region to be extremely busy. Victory reports were posted everywhere in cities such as Xingtai, Changzhi, Zuoquan, and Wu'an, and citizens gathered in crowds in front of public blackboards. A clerk in a store in Xingtai's South Gate ran back to the store to report the news after reading the victory report, shouting, "Long live General Chen Yi!"
