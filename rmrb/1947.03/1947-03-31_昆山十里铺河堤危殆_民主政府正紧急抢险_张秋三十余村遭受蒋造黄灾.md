    Kunshan Shili Pu Riverbank Perilous
    Democratic Government Engaged in Emergency Rescue
    Zhangqiu Over Thirty Villages Suffer from Chiang-Created Yellow River Disaster

    [Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 29th Dispatch] The old course of the Yellow River continues to rise sharply. Near Shili Pu in Kunshan (Xin County), the situation of the levee foot, a dangerous stretch of fifteen li, is critical. Although this section of the riverbank has been repaired with stones over the years, it still often experiences floods. After the Yellow River changed its course, most of the original materials were lost. After Chiang Kai-shek violated the agreement and released water last December, our side worked around the clock to repair it, but the project was forced to stop due to repeated bombing and strafing by Chiang's planes. Currently, the reconstruction is estimated to require 5 million catties of materials, plus labor and hemp rope costs, totaling more than 1 million 10,000 yuan in Jilu Yu currency. It will be extremely difficult to lay stones before the major flood season. Collapse during the high water season is a concern. If a breach occurs, Kunshan, Nanwang, and Yuncheng will be completely submerged, and millions of residents will be buried in the river. The local masses are extremely indignant and are urgently engaged in rescue work under the leadership of the democratic government. However, Chiang's troops have set up temporary strongholds at Daijia Temple in Kunshan, frequently engaging in activities in Shili Pu and other places, sabotaging levee construction, and driving away and arresting rescue workers. On the morning of the 25th, Chiang's troops burned all 30,000 catties of accumulated materials in Shili Pu. Their premeditated viciousness is deeply hated by the people of the liberated areas.

    [Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 29th Dispatch] On the 24th, this reporter visited Wu Junhua, the section chief of the Zhangqiu County Repair and Prevention Section, to inquire about the disaster suffered by residents of the old riverbed after the Chiang bandits blocked the Huayuankou. According to him, over thirty villages including Shaozhuang Qian Village in Zhangqiu County have been submerged. The democratic government is leading the masses, braving Chiang's artillery fire, to repair the remaining embankment, 6,580 meters long, in the area of Shaozhuang, Huangzhuang, Sunzhuang, and other villages, day and night. This reporter went to inspect the embankment on the 25th and saw that the west side of Tunbu Village had already been flooded. This village was a newly built village after 1938. All the land in the village, with more than thirty households, except for what is still submerged by the Yellow River, has become a stretch of sand. According to the villagers, if the Yellow River rises again, all the houses in the village will be submerged. They are extremely indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's heinous crimes. The foundations of the houses of Wang Baojia and Wang Shicun in the east of Shaozhuang were submerged by the Yellow River, and cracks have appeared in the walls, and they are being forced to prepare to move. Wang Shicun, who is in his fifties, supported his seventy-eight-year-old mother and said to the reporter: There are more than 110 households in Shaozhuang. In 1937, more than 50 households in the east were washed away by the flood. He pointed to the Yellow River surging fifty meters away and said, "That is the North Street that was washed away. If the flood rises again this year, I don't know how many more homes will be washed away. What hatred do we common people have with Lao Jiang? Why did he release the water before we were ready?"

    昆山十里铺河堤危殆
    民主政府正紧急抢险
    张秋三十余村遭受蒋造黄灾
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】故道黄水继续猛涨，昆山（新县）十里铺附近，长达十五里险工的堤根形势危殆。该段河堤过去虽历年铺石修理，仍常闹水灾。黄水改道后，原有材料大部散失。去年十二月蒋介石违约放水后，我方星夜抢修，因屡遭蒋机轰炸扫射，以致工程被迫停顿。目前重修，预计需材料五百万斤，加上土工及麻绳等费，共需冀钞百余万万元。大泛期前，绝难铺石。大汛期间崩溃堪虞，如一旦决口，昆山、南旺、郓城即将全被淹没，数百万居民将葬身鱼腹。当地群众，激愤万端，正在民主政府领导下紧急抢险。但蒋军在昆山戴家庙处布设临时据点，经常到十里铺等处活动，破坏堤工，驱逐及逮捕抢险群众。二十五日上午，蒋军又将十里铺积存材料三万斤全部焚毁，其蓄意狠毒，解放区人民切齿痛恨。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】二十四日记者曾走访张秋县修防段伍俊华段长，询以蒋贼堵死花园口后，故道河床居民遭受灾害的情形。据称：张秋县已有邵庄前村等三十村被淹没；民主政府正领导群众，冒蒋军炮火，星夜抢修邵庄、黄庄、孙庄等村一带，长达六千五百八十公尺的残堤。记者于二十五日赴沿堤视察，见屯逋村西边已被河水浸入。该村是民国二十七年后的新建村，全村三十余户，所有土地除尚在黄水淹没中的以外，其余已成一片沙滩。据该村民众谈：如黄水再涨，全村房屋即将全部被淹。他们对蒋介石此种滔天罪行极为愤慨。邵庄东头王保家、王士存等户的屋基被黄水浸没，墙壁均已裂缝，正被迫准备迁移。五十多岁的王士存，扶着七十八岁老母亲，对记者说：邵庄有一百一十余户，民国二十六年，东头的五十余户全被洪水冲了。他指着五十余公尺外波浪奔腾的黄水说：“那里就是被冲去的一道北街，今年大水再涨，不知道又要被冲去多少人家。俺老百姓和老蒋有啥仇气？为啥不等咱准备好就放水呢？”
