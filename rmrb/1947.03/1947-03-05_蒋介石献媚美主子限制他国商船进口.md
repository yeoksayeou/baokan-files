　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: A Nanjing dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 26th reported that the Kuomintang Executive Yuan's 777th routine meeting passed the "Measures for Special Permission for Import of Merchant Ships from Non-Treaty Countries by Customs." The measures stipulate that merchant ships from countries that have not signed so-called "reciprocal treaties" with the Chiang Kai-shek government "are not allowed to enter any Chinese port without prior permission from the customs." The ports permitted to enter are also limited to those that the Chiang government "has announced as open to overseas trade and commerce." "If merchant ships from non-treaty countries enter open Chinese ports without permission, the customs may refuse them with or without stating reasons." "If merchant ships from non-treaty countries violate Chinese navigation laws and regulations, the customs may detain the ships and handle them according to law." Sources in Yan'an pointed out that the above measures are equivalent to allowing American ships, which have concluded so-called "reciprocal treaties" with the Chiang government, to freely enter any Chinese port without obtaining prior permission from the customs. These measures were formulated by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to please his master, American imperialism, so that the United States could monopolize the rights to Chinese seaports. At the same time, under this "special permission" system of the Chiang government, Japanese ships, which have been freely coming to China for a long time under the orders of the US military headquarters in Japan, will henceforth receive "legal" protection.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: According to Shanghai newspapers, a Reuters dispatch from Moscow on January 10th stated: Moscow's "New Times" magazine declared that Britain is also demanding that the Kuomintang government sign a Sino-British commercial treaty "similar" to the Sino-US commercial treaty. Although the Kuomintang government is negotiating with Britain, well-informed reporters report that the Kuomintang government, on the advice of the United States, is doing its best to avoid granting Britain the same privileges as the United States. British business circles are dissatisfied with this. People in Shanghai commented on this matter, believing that it is not that the Chiang government is unwilling to sign treaties with countries other than the United States, but that Chiang Kai-shek is only doing it for the sake of his American master's monopoly of interests.

　　蒋介石献媚美主子限制他国商船进口
    【新华社延安二十八日电】中央社南京二十六日消息：国民党行政院七七七次例会通过“海关特许无约国商船进口办法”，该办法规定未与蒋介石政府订立所谓“互惠条约”之国家商船，“非先获得海关准许不准驶入中国任何港口”，准许驶入之港口，亦以蒋政府“宣布对海外贸易开放及通商之港口为限”。“无约国商船未经准许驶入中国开放港口，海关得声明或不声明理由拒绝之”，“无约国商船如有违背中国航政法令，海关得将该船扣留依法处理之”。延安人士指出：上述办法等于允许与蒋政府缔结所谓“互惠条约”之美国船只，可不必获得海关事先允许，自由驶入中国任何港口。该办法系卖国贼蒋介石为讨好其主子美帝国主义，使美国独占中国海港权而订定者。同时，在蒋政府此种“特许”制度下，可使很久以来即在驻日美军总部命令下自由来华之日本轮船，从此更获得“合法”之保障。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据沪报载，路透社莫斯科一月十日电称：莫斯科《新时代》杂志宣称，英国亦要求国民党政府签订一个“类似”中美商约的中英通商协定，虽然国民党政府正在与英国磋商，唯据消息灵通记者报导，国民党政府依美国意见，尽力避免予英国签订与美国同样的特权。英国商界为此发生不满，沪界人士评论此事，认为蒋政府也不是不愿与美国以外之其他国家订约，并不是蒋介石不愿卖国，只是为了他的美国主子独占利权的缘故。
