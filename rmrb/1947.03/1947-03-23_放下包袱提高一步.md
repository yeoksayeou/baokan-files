    Put Down the Burden and Take a Step Forward

    Over the past few years, the vast number of district and village cadres in the Liberated Areas have braved dangers and difficulties, leading the masses to defeat the Japanese invaders, eliminate feudalism, and make many contributions to the cause of the people's liberation. However, due to the incomplete overcoming of the influence of the old society on themselves, and the insufficient help and education from the leadership, they have often gained more in the distribution of fruits. These extra gains have become their burdens, hindering their progress, affecting their relationship with the masses, and adding difficulties to the implementation of the great historical task of thoroughly eliminating feudalism. We have called on good cadres to return the excess fruits, not only to achieve economic leveling and replenishment, but also to help cadres transform their thinking, take a step forward, do more work for the masses, and make greater contributions. After the cadres of Ganbao Village in Taiyue County returned the extra fruit they had received, they proposed to put down the burden and make new achievements, which is worth learning by village cadres in various regions. Solving the problem of cadres returning the excess fruit should not be done hastily. It should be actively approached, and a solution should be sought from the perspective of improving cadres' thinking, guiding cadres to be excited and happy rather than depressed after solving this problem, and to be more active in their work rather than passive.

    放下包袱提高一步
    解放区广大区村干部，数年来不避艰险，领导群众战胜日寇、扫除封建、为人民解放事业立下许多功劳。但由于旧社会对自己的影响没有完全克服，以及领导上帮助教育不够，因此，在果实分配中多得了东西。这些多得的果实成为自己的包袱，阻碍了自己进步，影响了自己与群众的关系，给彻底消灭封建这一伟大历史任务的贯彻增加了困难。我们曾号召好干部退出多得果实，这不仅为了经济上实现填平补齐，而且也是帮助干部改造思想、提高一步、为群众做更多工作，立更大功劳。太岳县干鲍村干部退出多分果实后，提出放下包袱再立功，值得各地区村干部学习。解决干部退出多得果实问题，不能草率从事，应积极的，从提高干部思想上求得解决，引导干部解决这一问题后，不是情绪沮丧，而是兴奋愉快，不是在工作上消极，而是更积极起来。
