　　Iron Flood
　　Adapted by Zhou Wen
　　The book "Iron Flood" was originally written by the Soviet author A.S. Serafimovich. This is a popular adaptation. The book tells the story of peasants, sailors, and handicraft workers from Kuban, Soviet Union, participating in the October Revolution twenty-nine years ago. Despite striving for freedom and liberation, we see this group of "rabble," under the slaughter of powerful enemies, with women and children, wearing ragged clothes, barefoot, with only three bullets per person, and more than half simply with empty guns. Such an army, in indescribable hardship, finally shattered the enemy's encirclement, swept away the powerful enemies, opened the fully armed city, and established a free and happy life. What a great feat! As we are waging a war of self-defense, reading this book is particularly touching. This story clearly tells us that the strength of the Soviet Union today comes from arduous struggle; the people's war is bound to be victorious.

　　铁流
    周文改编
    “铁流”一书，原为苏联罗拉木维支著，这本是改编了的大众本。书内是写二十九年前，苏联古班的农民、水手、手工工人参加十月革命的故事。尽管争取自由解放，我们看这伙“乌合之众”，在劲敌的屠杀下，带着女人孩子，穿着破烂衣裳，赤着足，一个人只有三粒子弹，有一大半简直只有一支空枪。这样的军队，在不能形容的艰苦中，终于粉碎了敌人的重围，扫荡了劲敌，打开全部武装的城池，建立了自由幸福的生活。这是多么伟大的壮举啊！在我们正在进行自卫战争的时候，看这本书，是会特别亲切的。这个故事，很明显的告诉我们：苏联今天的强大，是从艰苦斗争中得来的；人民的战争是必然会胜利的。
