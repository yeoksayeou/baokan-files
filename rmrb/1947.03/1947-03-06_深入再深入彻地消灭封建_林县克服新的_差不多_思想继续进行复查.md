　　Further and More Thoroughly Eliminate Feudalism
    Lin County Overcomes New "Good Enough" Mentality and Continues Re-examination
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After two months of intensive movement during the past winter and spring, Lin County has achieved significant results in land reform. Recently, the County Committee issued a call to all Party members and cadres to overcome the new "good enough" mentality and to launch a re-examination movement targeting backward areas, so that the movement throughout the county will move towards balance and achieve the goal of completely eliminating feudalism and realizing "land to the tiller." Most of the land in Lin County was redistributed in the early summer of last year. According to statistics from ten districts during the recent two months of intensive movement: peasants have recovered another 18,320 mu of land, 16,745 houses, 871 head of livestock, 63,350 pieces of farm tools and furniture, 17,116 shi of grain, 91,400 silver dollars, and many other items such as clothing. Most villages have eliminated extreme poverty, and in some villages, all poor peasants have been elevated to middle peasants. Special attention has been paid to mobilizing poor and hired peasants, mobilizing the backward, and mobilizing women. According to statistics from seven districts, more than 6,000 poor and hired peasant activists and more than 2,700 poor women activists have emerged during the two months of intensive movement, completing the first phase of the land reform intensive movement under tense conditions of war preparation and participation. Various organizations have also been developed and consolidated during the movement. However, because land redistribution in Lin County occurred relatively early, cadres and the masses generally focused on the "hidden assets" of landlords during the initial stages of the intensive movement, neglecting to investigate and clear out the landlords' dispersed and hidden land and farm tools, and neglecting the work of adjusting and supplementing in this regard. Therefore, even in villages with a relatively good working foundation and rapid movement development, some problems still exist. For example, in Nan Jingshe village, a first-class village in Hengshui District, the ideological education during the intensive phase was relatively prominent in the county, but the masses still had opinions about the fair distribution of old fruits, and some cadres took out some of the extra fruits, but not entirely voluntarily, and the masses were unwilling to accept them; another example is Datun village in Chengguan District, which is also a village with relatively good work, but the County Committee recently discovered that 70 mu of landlord land had not been taken back and distributed to the peasants after a slight inspection. In terms of the entire county, some backward villages, such as "peace villages" and "single-surname villages," have not been fully opened up, and the masses in mountain villages and shacks have not been universally mobilized. Almost all twelve districts in the county have such mountain villages. Based on the above situation, the Lin County Committee specifically pointed out: It is hoped that all cadres and Party members will be highly vigilant against complacency and overcome the new "good enough" mentality. The source of this mentality is satisfaction with the existing achievements, without looking far ahead and not seeing the next step. When the intensive movement was initially proposed, the leadership consciously broke the "good enough" mentality of cadres through specific land investigation and class investigation, and the movement in each district further developed, but when they saw that peasants who had never spoken up were also speaking, and new activists appeared in each struggle, or that many things (especially hidden assets) had been recovered from the landlords through intensive struggle, they unconsciously became complacent. Although everyone did not dare to mention "good enough," in essence it was a new "good enough" mentality. After five days of research at the county-wide enlarged cadre meeting, it was proposed to launch a re-examination targeting backward areas in the next month to a month and a half. To raise advanced villages, so that the second and third-class villages can catch up. Specifically stipulating that 232 first-class villages should carry out a solidarity and fraternity movement in conjunction with the re-examination, and finally have a systematic ideological self-conscious brainwashing movement; the remaining 257 second-class villages and 47 third-class villages will continue to start from targeting backward areas and mobilizing poor and hired peasants to catch up with first-class villages, so that the movement will move towards universal balance, achieve the county's complete elimination of feudalism, fill in the gaps, and realize "land to the tiller." In order to complete this urgent historical task, the County Committee called on all cadres to launch a movement to perform meritorious service for the people and to review the shortcomings of the past county committee's division of labor, with one leading group responsible for two districts, which was both laborious and unable to timely study, exchange, and promote experience. Therefore, in the future, it will be divided into three leading groups: the South Group will focus on the combination of Linqi, Qidong, and Dongyao, Yuankang, and Qiquan, three districts. The North Group will focus on the combination of Donggang, Weijiahe, and Hengshui District, and the central leadership group will mainly create experience in improving first-class villages.

　　深入再深入彻地消灭封建
    林县克服新的“差不多”思想继续进行复查
    【本报特讯】经过去冬今春两个月的深入运动，林县土地改革已获得显著成绩，日前县委会特向全体党员、干部发出号召，克服新的“差不多”思想，面向落后展开复查运动，使全县运动普遍走向平衡，达到彻底消灭封建实现耕者有其田的目的。林县大部分土地是在去年初夏时变动的，最近两个月深入运动中，据十个区的统计：农民又收回了一八三二○亩土地、一六七四五间房屋、八七一头牲畜、六三三五○件农具及家具、一七一一六石粮食、九一四○○元银洋、其他衣服等物甚多，大部分村庄已消灭了赤贫，且有些村庄贫农已全部上升为中农，特别是注意了发动贫雇，发动落后，发动妇女，据七个区的统计，两个月深入运动中涌现出六千多个贫雇积极分子，二千七百多个贫苦妇女积极分子，在紧张的备战参战情况下，完成了土地改革深入运动第一阶段的任务。并且在运动中发展与巩固了各种组织。但是由于林县土地变动较早，干部群众在深入运动初期普遍注意地主“内货”，而忽略清查地主分散隐藏的土地农具、忽略在这方面的调剂与填补工作。因此即使工作基础较好，运动发展较快的村庄，也存在着一些问题，例如横水区的一等村南景色，深入阶段的思想教育在全县说来都是较突出的，可是对旧日的果实分配填平补齐方面群众还是有意见的，有些干部虽把一部分多得的果实拿出来，但也不是完全出于自觉自愿，群众也不乐意接受；又例如城关区的大屯村，也是工作较好的村庄，最近县委稍一检查即发现七十亩地主的土地未取回分给农民。若就全县范围来说，还有些“和平村”，“一姓村”等落后村没有完全打开局面，山庄窝铺的群众没有普遍发动起来，而这种山庄全县十二个区几乎没有一个区没有，根据以上情况，林县县委特别提出：希望全县干部党员十分警惕自满情绪，克服新的“差不多”思想，这种思想来源是满足于已有的一点成绩，没有往远处看，看不到下一步。当深入运动开始提出时，领导上有意识的从具体的查田查阶级中，使干部打破“差不多”思想，各区运动都有进一步开展，但当看到从来不吭气农民也讲话了，每次斗争都有新的积极分子出现，或者是经过深入斗争，从地主手中收回的东西（尤其是内货）不少，便不自觉的自满起来。虽然大家不敢提“差不多”，实质上却是新的“差不多”思想。经五天全县扩大干部会研究结果，提出在今后一个月到一个半月内，面向落后，展开复查。提高先进村，使二、三等村迎头赶上，具体规定二三二个一等村结合复查开展一个团结友爱运动，最后来个系统的思想自觉换脑筋运动；其余二五七个二等村，四七个三等村则是继续从面向落后，发动贫雇入手，迎头赶上一等村，使运动走向普遍平衡，达到全县彻底消灭封建，填平补齐实现耕者有其田。并为了完成这一紧迫的历史任务，县委会号召全体干部开展一个为民立功运动，并检讨过去一个县委分工领导两个区，既吃力又不能及时研究，交流推广经验的缺点。因此今后分成三个领导集团，南集团把重点放在临淇、淇东和东姚、元康、七泉，三个区的结合部。北集团重点在东岗、魏家河和横水区的结合部，中部的领导集团主要创造提高一等村的经验。
