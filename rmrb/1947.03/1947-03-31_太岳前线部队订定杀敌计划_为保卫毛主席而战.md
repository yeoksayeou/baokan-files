    Taiyue Front Troops Formulate Plans to Kill the Enemy
    Fight to Defend Chairman Mao
    [This newspaper Taiyue, 29th dispatch] A certain brigade under General Chen Geng's command, which has annihilated over 11,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's troops in the past eight months, has launched a campaign to make meritorious achievements in defending Chairman Mao. In the past eight months, the brigade has fought on the Datong-Puzhou Railway, southwestern Shanxi, and central Shanxi battlefields, annihilating four full brigades of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops, capturing alive Chiang's First Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng, Deputy Brigade Commander Dai Tao, and Chen Chengwu, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 67th Brigade. 7,400 officers and soldiers below the rank of general, including Yan Xishan's 69th Division Deputy Commander Wang Xiongming, were captured alive, and over 4,000 were killed. News of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's offensive against Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region angered all the commanders and fighters of the unit. Each company and hero scrambled to announce their plans to make meritorious achievements in defending Chairman Mao. Special-class combat hero Wu Hengbao eagerly asked his superiors to immediately give him combat missions to eliminate the invading Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan troops. Li Buzhou announced that he would capture five Chiang soldiers alive and seize five rifles as a gift to defend Chairman Mao. The company commander and political instructor of a certain company of the Third Battalion and all the cadres wrote in a letter of determination to the Party committee: "To defend Chairman Mao, we are determined to annihilate an enemy company." The general meeting of all Party members of the Second Battalion was even more filled with impassioned emotions. They formulated their own plans. Jiao Songming would do a good job in rescue work to ensure that the wounded would not suffer. Yan Dazui said: "I myself will get a light machine gun!" A certain company secretary said: "Strive to transform twenty-two party members into heroes!" Liberated soldier Jiang Shanjun said: "Defending Chairman Mao is defending our parents. Our mutual aid group of four people will capture six Chiang soldiers." To ensure the completion of the task, the unit established mutual aid groups in each squad. They practiced martial arts intensively from morning to night every day. Each mutual aid group concretely implemented mutual aid. Old soldiers educated new soldiers, and new soldiers helped old soldiers. Everyone's morale was unprecedentedly high.
    [This newspaper Taiyue, 29th dispatch] The campaign to make meritorious achievements in defending Chairman Mao is currently unfolding in the various field corps and local corps of the Taiyue Front. Since the announcement of the meritorious service plan of the special-class hero Li Buzhou in Taiyue, the meritorious service movement in the troops throughout the region has become even more enthusiastic. Regiment Commander Jiang of a certain regiment and six heroes from the Special Service Company who participated in the heroic conference of the column, including Xu Xiting, Ji Wenzhong, Gao Yutian, and Ma Jinxi, all earnestly formulated plans to make meritorious achievements according to their respective work positions. Platoon Leader Guo Xinchun said: I guarantee that our platoon will annihilate an enemy platoon and capture the equipment of a platoon. Under the active promotion and influence of Jiao Wubao and Jing Laifa, the Liberation Detachment has launched a competition in each squad, platoon, and company. The Seventh Company Branch of the 407 Unit first challenged other units, proposing to create a model branch. The Ninth Company of the 409 Unit challenged Jing Laifa's company, and five squads and Yan Cunren's group challenged Jiao Wubao. The Jiao Wubao movement has now spread to the local corps. The Special Service Company directly under the 21st Sub-district began rectification and training, learning from Jiao Wubao's spirit of enduring hardship before enjoying happiness and the good methods of leading soldiers, with great results.
