　　Taihang Second Prefectural Administrative Office Agricultural and Forestry Bureau
    Formulates Afforestation Plan
    [Reported by this newspaper] After seeing the Administrative Office's call for afforestation, the students of the Taihang Second Prefectural Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's technical training class were greatly encouraged. Based on the conditions in various places, they launched heated discussions and formulated afforestation plans separately: (1) For the existing mountain forests in Heshun and Xiyang, they proposed the slogan of "sustaining the mountains by utilizing the mountains" to protect, manage, and renovate them. Plant cold-resistant pine trees, walnut trees, etc. to solve the fuel problem. (2) In Wu Xiang, Yuci, Zuoquan and Xiangtan along the Zhang River, plant a large number of willow trees to create "flood control forests" and protect the paddy fields. (3) In the suburbs of Zuoquan City and "Zuoquan Forest," where the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau is located, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau will cooperate with various organizations, groups, schools, and the masses to plant a large number of trees as a demonstration area for afforestation. (4) Mobilize organizations, schools, and cooperatives to create "foundation forests" and "construction forests." Regarding afforestation methods: (1) Prepare the saplings before Qingming Festival. (2) Each person in organizations, groups, and schools plants one to two trees, and each unit guarantees a survival rate of 70%. (3) Each trainee plants three trees and mobilizes every household in their village to plant trees. (4) Organize an afforestation committee (attached to the village technical committee), restore mountain closures, formulate forest protection covenants, and propose slogans for loving the forest (Zuo Nong Communication Group, Forestry Section).
