　　The liberated masses in Xingtai City, after receiving a portion of the fruits of struggle, have actively organized themselves and engaged in production, combined with thorough liquidation. Guided by the idea of "having permanent property leads to having a stable occupation," many poor citizens no longer simply set up small stalls or sell scrap (this business earns little money, is unreliable, and sometimes even loses money), but automatically raise funds to open various handicraft factories and workshops. The masses in Nanguan raised funds to establish a large-scale iron factory, which has already started operations after the Spring Festival. It employs over a hundred workers, mostly unemployed blacksmiths and citizens in the past. They are actively building agricultural implements such as iron pliers, plows, and shovels. The masses in Dong Street, District 1, raised 2 million yuan to open a textile factory. Currently, five hand-pulled shuttle looms and three sock knitting machines are in operation. In addition, an iron-wheeled machine will be repaired within days. At present, they can produce at least three bolts of wide cloth and nine dozen socks per day, netting a profit of 8,000 to 9,000 yuan after expenses. The factory uses 25 jin of thread daily, and the more than one hundred women spinners in the street no longer worry about the sales of their thread, and their lives are also guaranteed. Chenghuang Temple Street in District 2 has also found four cloth machines, raised over 400,000 yuan, and is preparing to establish a weaving factory. Women are also buying spinning wheels to prepare to spin thread. According to preliminary investigations, at least five or six weaving factories can be opened recently, which can solve the employment problem for thousands of women.

　　邢市翻身群众获得生产资金
    集资开办工厂作坊
    【本报讯】邢台市群众分到部分斗争果实后，结合深入清算，纷纷自动组织起来，积极生产。在“有恒产，有恒业”的思想引导下，许多贫苦市民已不再单纯摆小摊、卖破烂（此营业赚钱既少，也不牢靠，有时还赔钱），而自动集资开办各种手工业工厂和作坊。南关群众集资成立了一个规模宏大的铁工厂，已于春节后开工，工人百余名，多系过去失业的铁匠和市民，他们正在积极打造铁钳、犁、铲等农具。一区东街群众集资二百万元，开办纺织工厂一个，现已有五架手拉梭机和三部织袜机动工，另有铁轮机一部，日内即可修复，目下每日至少可出宽面布三匹及袜子九打，除开支外可净赚红利八九千元。该厂每日用线二十五斤，该街一百多个纺妇已不再愁钱的销路，生活也有保证了。二区的城隍庙街，也已找到布机四架，集资四十多万，筹备成立一个织工厂，妇女也纷纷买纺车准备纺线。据初步调查，最近至少可开办五六个织工厂，可解决成千妇女的职业问题。
