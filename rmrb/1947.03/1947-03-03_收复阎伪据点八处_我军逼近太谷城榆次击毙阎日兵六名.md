　　Recapturing Eight 阎伪 Strongholds
    Our Army Approaches Taigu City and Yuci, Killing Six 阎日 Soldiers
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 1st dispatch] Our 2nd Military Sub-district's main force, a certain unit, cooperating with the Taigu Independent Battalion, on the 17th of last month, counteracted the encroachment of 阎伪, and recovered eight villages and towns, including Xiaobai, Baiyan, Wangcun, Dongxi Hu, Shangxia Zhuang, and Dongli, 阎伪 strongholds in Taigu. It controlled a plain area of over thirty li, approaching the outskirts of Taigu city. They killed or wounded over forty enemies, captured forty-two enemies below the rank of company commander, seized one light machine gun, ten rifles, two small cannons, over a hundred *shi* of grain, and many other spoils of war. The notorious local tyrant, Shuan Cheng, was captured and handed over to the masses for execution. The masses in this area had suffered greatly under the 四光 (kill all, burn all, loot all, destroy all) policies of the 阎伪 regime. Their joy was boundless at being liberated once again. That day at dawn, our army reconnoitered the enemy's situation and ambushed the high ground east of Xiaobai Town. When the enemy from Xiaobai entered our ambush circle, we dealt them a heavy blow, killing over ten enemies and capturing nineteen. Our army then took advantage of the victory to attack the Xiaobai stronghold, and after a day of intense fighting, Xiaobai was recaptured. On the same day, the enemy from Baiyan mobilized to reinforce, but was again ambushed by our army, resulting in over thirty enemies killed and twenty-three enemies below the rank of company commander captured. We then took advantage of the victory and turned to attack the enemy stronghold in Gaolou. The enemy's seven reinforcement attempts were all repelled. That night, all eight villages and towns mentioned above were completely liberated.
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 1st dispatch] On February 11th, over four hundred 阎伪 troops and over seven hundred Japanese soldiers retained by the traitor 阎锡山, departed from Yucyi city to invade our newly liberated villages of Shantou, Zhuangzi, Lutai, and Zikeng, attempting to plunder the masses. That day, our local guerrilla corps, in coordination with the militia and work teams from the newly recovered areas, ambushed in Zhuangzi Village. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was routed. Six Japanese soldiers were killed, and twenty-four 阎 and Japanese soldiers were wounded. We only sacrificed one soldier.
