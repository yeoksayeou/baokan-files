    Eighth Route Army Unit's Seventh Company, First Squad
    Unity and Mutual Assistance Between New and Veteran Soldiers
    [This newspaper's report from the JiluYu Front on the 22nd] The First Squad of the machine gun platoon in the Seventh Company of a certain regiment of the Eighth Route Army Field Army has not experienced any desertions in the past year, despite intense battles and arduous marches of over seven thousand li. The captured soldiers and new recruits from the base areas who were successively added to the squad have all been trained to be brave and steadfast in the friendly and affectionate atmosphere of the squad. Three members of the squad have been promoted to squad leader, and two have become deputy squad leaders. Comrade Liu Hanzhu, who originally led this squad, has been promoted to platoon leader of the company's first platoon. Platoon Leader Liu has led assault teams seven times during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Self-Defense War, and is known for his bravery and tenacity. However, he is very kind to his comrades, so the soldiers under his leadership can unite and help each other like brothers. Veteran soldiers take care of new soldiers, and new soldiers respect veteran soldiers. They never quarrel or fight, making them a model squad for consolidating the troops. Zhang Qunsheng, who was captured in the Ping-Han Campaign, once thought of running away. Later, he reflected and said, "That night I climbed over the wall and didn't see anyone. But I thought about how good the squad leader was to me, and I felt so sorry for him, so I quietly climbed back." After Liu was promoted to platoon leader, the squad still maintained its original fine traditions. The current squad leader, Ding Jichang, is straightforward, but a bit impatient. Under Liu's influence, he has also learned to use patience, persuasion, specific care, and concern to raise the awareness of the soldiers. Two comrades who were captured in the Xitai battle were in low spirits because they had lost all their belongings and kept sleeping and didn't want to get up. Squad Leader Ding mobilized the whole squad to give them clothes and shoes, which immediately lifted their spirits. During the long march south, the tall members of the squad often helped other squads carry guns, and Deputy Squad Leader Liu Yunqing always carried sixty or seventy jin of supplies and refused to let anyone take his place. Under their impetus, no one in the entire company deserted, no one fell behind, and no one rode in trucks.

    八一部队某团七连一班
    新老战士团结互助
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十二日电】野战军八一部队，×团七连机枪第一班，一年来在紧张战斗及七千余里艰苦的长行军中从未发生逃亡。该班先后补充的解放战士及根据地新战士，均在班内亲密友爱的气氛中锻炼得勇敢坚定。全班被提升为班长者已有三人，为副班长者二人，原来领导这个班的刘汉珠同志已升任该连一排长。刘排长在抗日战争与自卫战争中带过七次突击队，以勇猛顽强著称，但对自己同志却非常和蔼，因而在他领导下的战士，都能团结互助，如兄弟手足。老战士照顾新战士，新战士尊敬老战士，从不争嘴打架，成为巩固部队的模范班。平汉战役解放过来的张群生曾想逃跑，后来他反省说：“那一夜我翻过墙头，一个人也没有看见。不过我想起班长这样好，真太对不起他了，所以悄悄的又爬了回来。”该班在刘升任排长后仍保持原来的优良作风，现任班长丁继昌为人爽直，但是有些急燥，他在刘的影响下也学会了用忍耐说服与具体的关心照顾去提高战士觉悟。有两个西台战斗解放过来的同志，因为东西丢光了情绪很低，老睡着不想起，丁班长发动全班送他们衣服鞋子，立刻使他们情绪高起来了。部队南下长行军时，该班大个子经常帮助别班扛枪，副班长刘云清老是抬着六七十斤不让人换，全连在他们推动下没有一个逃跑的，没有一个掉队的，而且没有一个坐大车的。
