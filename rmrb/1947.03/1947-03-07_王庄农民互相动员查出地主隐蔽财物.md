(Jinan, Hebei, March 5th) After repeated investigations of feudal landlords in Mazhuang and Wangzhuang, Zhengtang (formerly Xinhe County) Third District, a large number of hidden properties were unearthed. After the completion of the struggle for rent reduction in Mazhuang, the peasants' association held group discussions and unanimously agreed that too much land and housing had been left for the landlords, and the peasants had not completely turned the tables. Many people still had "conscience" and "compassionate" views. After discussions, everyone proposed to re-liquidate the five landlord households, including Wang Tongde, and one feudal rich peasant household, and to recover the fruits of their labor. The rent reduction in Wangzhuang not only left the landlords with too much to live on, but also failed to recover their property. After the members mobilized each other, some of the backward members recognized the landlords' conspiracy, drew a clear line with the class enemy, and successively offered up things they had hidden for the landlords. In one day, they offered up 39.2 zhang of homespun cloth, seven single garments, and many other quilts and utensils.

　　王庄农民互相动员查出地主隐蔽财物
    【本报冀南五日电】振堂（原新河县）三区马庄、王庄反复清查封建地主挖出大批隐蔽财物。马庄查减斗争完后经翻身会分组讨论，一致认为给地主留地、房太多，农民还未翻透身。有许多群众还存有“良心”和“慈悲”观点，讨论后大家又提出对王同得等五户地主与一户封建富农再度清算，并追交果实。王庄查减不但与地主留生活多，而且财物未追出来，经会员互相动员后，一部分落后会员认识了地主阴谋，划清了阶级界限，相继献出为地主隐藏的东西；一天中献出花粗布三十九丈二尺，单衣七件及其他被褥器具等多件。
