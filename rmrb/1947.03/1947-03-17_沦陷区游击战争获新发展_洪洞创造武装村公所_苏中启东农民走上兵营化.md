Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 14th: Hongdong County has created a comprehensive armed village government, persisting in guerrilla warfare in the areas occupied by the Chiang army, ensuring that the orders of the democratic government remain effective and in force. This armed village government is a combination of the village government and the rural people's armed self-defense committee, with a lean and efficient structure, detached from production. After a certain village first established this kind of government, it immediately captured plainclothes armed secret agents and suppressed saboteurs, greatly boosting the morale of the masses. Subsequently, six Chiang-occupied villages also organized armed governments, and demarcated guard zones bordering the enemy, coordinating with rotational warfare teams for guard defense. Masses in the Chiang-occupied areas must have a letter of introduction and proof from the armed village government to purchase goods in the liberated areas, and masses in the liberated areas must also have proof to leave the area. This measure has gradually silenced secret agent activities. In January, when the enemies in Hongdong strongholds organized conscription, the armed village government mobilized to help the masses transfer the young and strong men of nine villages. Now, small groups of enemies in each stronghold no longer dare to carry out activities outside the villages.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th: In a certain district of Qidong, Central Jiangsu, more than a hundred miles across the river from Shanghai, behind Chiang's army lines, the people's self-defense forces have greatly developed after the land re-examination. The entire district's peasants have embarked on militarization. The militia implements battalion, company, and platoon formations, with each village as a platoon, several villages as a company, and a township organized into a militia battalion. Taking the platoon as a unit, they collectively camp, attend classes, and discuss combat methods at night, actively destroying major roads and building minor roads, and transforming the terrain. Checkpoints are set up at village intersections to check pedestrians at any time, and members of the Peasant Association report the situation from house to house. On the 18th of last month, the entire district conducted a major inspection. During the day, every household raised a large flag, and at night, torches were lit, and shouts of "Down with the reactionaries" were heard from all directions.

　　沦陷区游击战争获新发展
    洪洞创造武装村公所
    苏中启东农民走上兵营化
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十四日电】洪洞县创造一揽子武装村公所，坚持蒋军侵占区游击战争，使民主政府命令照常有效通行。这一武装村公所为村政权及农村人民武装自卫委员会合组而成，机构精悍，脱离生产。某村首先建立此种政权后，即捕捉便衣武装特务，镇压破坏分子，群众情绪大为振奋。随即有六个蒋占村也组织了武装政权，并划出敌我毗连之警卫地带，配合轮战队警卫防守。蒋占区群众到解放区购买物资，须有武装村公所之介绍证明，解放区群众出境也须有证明。这种措施使特务活动逐渐消声匿迹。一月份，洪洞各据点敌人编组抓丁时，武装村公所即动员帮助群众转移了九个村的青壮丁，现各据点小股敌人已不敢出村活动。
    【新华社华中十日电】与上海隔江相距百余里之苏中蒋军后方启东某区土地复查后，群众自卫力量有巨大发展。全区农民走上兵营化，民兵实行营连排编制，每村为一排，几个村为一连，一乡编成一个民兵营。以排为单位，夜里集体宿营、上课、讨论战斗的办法，积极破大路筑小路，改造地形。各村路口设盘查哨，随时检查行人，农联会员更挨户报告情况。上月十八日全区进行大检查，日里家家扯起大旗，夜间点起火把，四面八方传出“打倒反动派”的喊声。
