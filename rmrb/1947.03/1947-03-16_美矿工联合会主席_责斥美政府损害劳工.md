　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Reports from various sources: Lewis, president of the US Mine Workers Union, delivered a speech to the Senate Labor Committee on the 7th, denouncing the US government's interference with basic labor rights and its totalitarian tendencies. Lewis stated, "Any restriction on labor rights by Congress will establish a totalitarian form of government in the United States; when the workers' right to strike is restricted or deprived, the form of government in the United States will change! The only difference between slavery and freedom is the right to conclude voluntary contracts. The United States' cancellation of the right to strike is turning the clock back to the Middle Ages." Lewis also stated, "As long as the right to strike is restricted, whether the restriction is for an hour, a day, or sixty days, it restricts the basic freedom of American workers." Lewis continued to attack the anti-labor proposals in Congress one by one, saying, "The plan to establish a Federal Mediation Board and stipulate a cooling-off period before a strike will be the first step in implementing compulsory arbitration for our country's workers; it is also the despotic knife, piercing the heart of free America for the first time."

    责斥美政府损害劳工
    【新华社延安十日电】各方报导：美矿工联合会主席路易斯，七日在参院劳工委员会中发表演说，责斥美政府之干涉劳工基本权利及其极权倾向。路氏称：“国会对劳工权利的任何限制，将在美国建立一个极权形式的政府；当工人的罢工权利受到限制或剥夺时，美国的政府形式就要变了！奴役与自由的唯一区别，就是缔结自愿契约的权利，美国取消了罢工权利，即是把时钟摆回到中世纪去”。路氏又称：“只要罢工权利受到限制，不管限制是一小时、一天、或六十天，就是限制美国工人基本自由”。路氏继对国会中的反劳工建议案一一予以抨击，路氏称：“成立联邦调解局及在罢工之前规定冷静时期的计划，将是对我国工人实施强迫仲裁的第一步；也是专制主义的利刀，第一次刺入自由美国的心脏”。
