Our Army Unit Passes Through Yuanchao
Masses Welcome Them on Both Sides of the Road
Affectionate Like Family
[Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region on the 22nd] When a unit of our army arrived in the Yuanchao County area, a scene of love and affection between the army and the people was evident. Groups of Children's League members, Sisters' League members, and men and women masses beat drums and gongs, danced the yangge, and carried pork stew to welcome and comfort their own army on both sides of the road. The democratic government also immediately prepared grain, firewood, oil, salt, and other supplies, and called on all districts and villages to cherish their own army with the feelings of family members, so that the army could receive comfort in both material and spiritual ways. When the troops arrived, the windows in the villages were already papered, the bunks were set up, everything was swept clean, and the oil lamps were filled. Everything was ready. Women members of some villages helped the soldiers with their chores. The leaders of the troops also called on the troops to do a good job in mass work, maintain the village contact system, participate in the "full vat" movement, help with chores, and comfort the families of soldiers. The soldiers, seeing the meticulous care of the democratic government and the masses for them, worked even harder on mass work. For example, in a village where troops were stationed, they repaired the streets and hauled soil and delivered manure for the masses on the third day. The government's preferential treatment of military families was also very well done. In Yuanchao, none of the 8,000 military families went without food. Military family representative comfort groups went to various troops to report on land reform and preferential treatment, and the soldiers all praised the work of the government upon hearing this.
[Another dispatch] Tens of thousands of liberated peasants in a certain county and district recently voluntarily selected representatives and requested the county head to lead them, playing folk instruments and carrying generous comfort goods to enthusiastically comfort General Liu Bocheng's direct troops in a village at the front. Among the comfort goods were precious Yellow River carp. After the comfort team arrived, the troops lined up to greet them. Amidst the sound of drums and gongs, the liberated peasants presented the comfort goods. Then, intimate conversations began between the army and the people. The commanders and fighters inquired with concern about the land reform situation in the district, and the peasants also asked about the news of victory at the front. The army and the people were as close as family.
