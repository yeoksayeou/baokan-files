Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: TASS, New York—As most American newspapers ignore the growing public opposition to Truman's proposal to aid Greece and Turkey, American Progressive Citizens published an appeal in the New York Times on March 18th, criticizing Truman's proposal, and attached the full text of former Vice President Wallace's radio address on March 13th. The appeal stated: "The President's proposal to send arms and money to Greece and Turkey is a dangerous move toward war. We sincerely hope that Congress will decide on this major measure only after its full implications are thoroughly understood by the people."

"American money and personnel should not be used to support emperors and empires. The entire strength of the United States should be used to support the United Nations." The appeal also urged readers to protest to Truman "against his unilateral actions undermining the spirit and purpose of the United Nations"; "immediately write to senators and representatives, urging them to oppose Truman's proposal"; "support genuine relief, which should be strictly allocated based on need and with wartime allies given priority." At the same time, American Progressive Citizens declared that on the 21st, two hundred representatives from twelve states would go to Washington to hold demonstrations against American military aid to Greece and Turkey, and against domestic anti-labor legislation. Congressman Marcantonio declared at a rally in New York that Truman's proposal was similar to Nazi Germany's propaganda under the slogan of anti-communism. New York State Democratic Congressman Powell also opposed Truman's proposal.

On the 15th and 16th of this month, pastors of several churches in New York City also opposed the United States endangering peace with its aggressive policies. Twenty-four Protestants and leaders of some pacifist groups, along with Mrs. Hull, Chairman of the "National Women's League for Peace and Freedom," jointly wrote to Truman, condemning his plans for Greece and Turkey.

Fitzpatrick, President of the Pittsburgh Electrical Workers Union, telegraphed Truman, protesting the transformation of the United States into a world empire. The headquarters of the San Francisco Longshoremen's Union telegraphed Wallace, praising his radio address. The maritime workers' Philadelphia and Seattle port committees protested against supplying weapons to the fascist Greek government, and declared: "American sailors have suffered enough from the pain of war." The American Women's Congress attacked Truman for undermining America's tradition of justice and freedom for all nations. Paul Robeson, Chairman of the Philippine Affairs Committee and singer, issued a statement pointing out that the policies proposed by Truman were very similar to the anti-communist rhetoric of fascist aggressors. Karaflos, Chairman of the Chicago Greek Organizations Federation, declared that American intervention in Greek internal affairs was not helping the Greek people. Mr. Karaflos said that the United States should not support "the fascist Greek government, which only represents Quislings and collaborationists elected under British bayonets." The New York Times reported that many American groups and unions were deeply disturbed by Truman's plan, fearing that it would subvert the prestige of the United Nations. Senator Smith of the Foreign Affairs Committee gave the press thirteen questions about Greece and Turkey. Smith said that before helping "Greece and Turkey, the United States should immediately notify the United Nations, and if any better way to maintain peace is to be taken, the whole situation requires group consultation and collective action by the United Nations." Smith asked: Did the United Nations not propose that war is illegal? Is it not meant to resolve disputes by peaceful means? On what grounds do we send military experts to train Greek troops and arm them? Senator Johnson sharply criticized Truman's proposal, believing that his proposal was leading to political and military intervention on a worldwide scale. He said: "The President is calling for support for emperors and rulers, not for hungry people." He pointed out that Truman made his speech at the same time that Marshall arrived in Moscow, and he accused Truman, Vandenberg, and American reactionaries of deliberately undermining the United Nations organization.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: New York—Kenneth, President of the American "National Lawyers Guild," said that he intends to convene a special emergency executive committee meeting of the Guild in Detroit on April 13th to discuss "the dangers facing the United States as a result of Truman's recent foreign policy statement to Congress."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: New York—Freda Kirchwey, editor of The Nation, commented on Truman's proposal to aid Greece and Turkey, saying that according to Truman's plan, American money and armaments will be used simultaneously to establish the "stability" of the Greek economy and to crush the "rebellion" in that country. Ms. Kirchwey said: "The Greek guerrillas are fighting because they have the support of the majority of the Greek people, who can no longer endure under the oppression of right-wing outlaws and soldiers." Ms. Kirchwey continued: Americans must ask themselves whether they are continuing Churchill's policies? Are they really willing to wage the political war that Truman has already declared?

    杜鲁门援助土希反动政策
    美国各界均表愤慨
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：由于美国大部分报章漠视人民对杜鲁门援助希、土建议之日益增涨的反对，美国进步公民三月十八日在《纽约时报》刊载一抨击杜鲁门建议的呼吁书，其中并附有前副总统华莱士三月十三日之广播讲演全文。呼吁书宣称：“总统建议送给希腊与土耳其的军火与金钱，是走向战争的危险行动，我们热诚的希望国会对此种重大的措施，应待其全部含意彻底为人民所了解后始作决定。”
    “美国的金元与人员不应用来支持皇帝与帝国，美国的全部力量应用以支持联合国”。呼吁书又敦促读者向杜鲁门抗议，“反对由他一个人的行动破坏联合国的精神与宗旨”；“立即致函参众议员，敦促他们反对杜鲁门的建议”；“支持真正的救济，这些救济应以需要与战时盟国保有优先权为原则的严格分配”。同时美国进步公民宣称：二十一日将有代表十二个州的代表二百人，前往华盛顿举行反对美国军事援助希腊与土耳其，反对国内反劳工立法的示威游行。众议员马肯尔尼奥在纽约的集会上宣称：杜鲁门的建议与在反共口号下的纳粹德国宣传相类似，纽约州民主党众议员鲍威尔也反对杜鲁门的建议。
    本月十五、十六两日，纽约城几个教堂的牧师讲道时，也反对美国以侵略的政策危害和平。二十四位新教徒及一些和平主义团体的领袖与“全国妇女争取和平自由同盟”的主席赫尔夫人，共同写信给杜鲁门，谴责其对希腊、土耳其的计划。
    匹兹堡电力工人职工会主席菲兹巴特利克，致电杜鲁门，抗议变美国为世界帝国。旧金山码头工会总部致电华莱士，赞扬其广播讲演，海员工人费城与西雅图港口委员会，抗议将武器供应法西斯希腊政府，并宣称：“美国海员已受够了战争的痛若”。美国妇女代表大会，攻击杜鲁门破坏美国对各民族正义与自由的传统。菲岛事务委员会主席、歌唱家罗伯逊发表声明，指出杜鲁门所建议的政策与法西斯侵略者反共烟极相类似。芝加哥希腊团体联合会主席卡拉弗罗斯宣称：美国干预希腊内政不是帮助希腊人民。卡氏称：美国不应支持“只代表吉斯林分子与在英国刺刀下选出的合作主义者的法西斯希腊政府”。纽约时报报导：许多美国团体与工人都唯恐杜鲁门计划颠复了联合国的威望而大感不安。参院外委会委员史密斯交给新闻界十三个关于希腊、土耳其的问题。史密斯称：美国应在帮助“希腊、土耳其之前，立即通知联合国，若要采取任何较好的办法保持和平，则整个形势要求联合国的集团商议与集体行动”。史密斯问道：联合国不是曾建议战争为非法吗？不是要以和平办法解决纠纷吗？我们以什么理由派遣军事专家去训练希腊军队作战并武装他们呢？参议员约翰逊尖锐批评杜鲁门的建议，认为他的建议是导向全世界规模的政治与军事干涉。他说：“总统是在呼吁支持皇帝与统治者，而不是支持饥饿的人民”。他指出杜鲁门发表演说，恰与马歇尔到达莫斯科同时，他责备杜鲁门登堡与美国反动分子蓄意破坏联合国机构。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】纽约讯：美“全国律师公会”主席肯尼称：他拟于四月十三日在底特律城召开该公会之特别紧急执委会议，以研讨“由于杜鲁门最近对国会发表的外交政策声明，而使美国所面对的危险”。
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】纽约讯：民族周刊编辑吉尔区维评论杜鲁门援助希土事建议称：按照杜鲁门的计划，美国的金钱与军备将同时用来建立希腊经济的“稳定”与粉碎该国的“叛乱”，吉氏称：“希腊游击队之作战是因为他们拥有大部分希腊人民的支持，在右翼不法之徒与士兵们的压迫之下，这些人民已无法再忍受下去了。”吉氏继称：美国人必须问问自己他们是否在继续邱吉尔的政策？他们是否真正愿意进行杜鲁门已经宣布了的政治战？
