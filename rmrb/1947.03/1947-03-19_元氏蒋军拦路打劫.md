　　Due to the layer upon layer of exploitation by the Kuomintang (KMT) officers in Yuanshi, the soldiers have no cotton-padded clothing in the severe winter. They frequently block roads and rob passers-by of their cotton-padded clothes. On February 23rd, a small merchant from Zhao County, while transporting goods near Beicun Village in the fifth district of the county, was suddenly accosted by a Kuomintang soldier, whose clothes were extremely tattered. The soldier stripped him of his clothes and robbed him of his goods. On February 24th, seven more small merchants, wearing only thin clothing, fled to our district's Dongzheng Village. They said, "The enemy commander and soldiers in Yuanshi are robbing the people of their cotton-padded clothes to get through the winter." The KMT bandits in Huolu are even more ferocious, even robbing pedestrians of their shoes and hats, creating a scene of deserted roads and few people in the enemy-occupied area. Recently, between Ren Village and Lingdi, they robbed more than ten hats, seventy-eight cotton-padded jackets and trousers, forty-four pairs of socks, seventy-eight pairs of shoes, twenty-seven yards of cloth, and more than thirty quilts from passing pedestrians in a single day. Two women in Lingdi were even chased into the village by KMT soldiers and stripped of their trousers.

　　元氏蒋军拦路打劫
    【本报太行十五日电】元氏蒋伪军官层层剥削下，士兵严冬无棉衣，经常拦路劫夺路人棉衣。二月廿三日赵县小商，贩货路经该县五区北村附近时，突从路旁跳出一衣裤极为褴褛之蒋军，将其衣服剥去，货物抢走。同月廿四日，复有小商七人穿着单衣逃奔我区东正村，据云：“元氏敌司令士兵抢剥人民棉衣过冬。”又获鹿蒋伪抢夺更凶，甚至连行人鞋帽都悉数抢去，造成敌占区路断人稀景象。最近在任村岭底之间一日即抢去来往行人帽子十余顶，棉衣裤七十八件，袜子四十四双，鞋七十八双，布二十七丈，被子三十余条。岭底有两妇女竟亦被蒋军追至村内，将裤子剥去。
