　　【This Newspaper Special Dispatch】In order to implement land reform, the Central Bureau of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Land Reform Inspection Team, divided into three groups, departed on the 21st of last month to Taiyue, Taihang, Jinnan, and the Jin-Lu-Yu border areas to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the implementation of land reform in various regions. Before the departure of the team, Comrade Nie Zhen spoke about the current land reform movement: Under the call of the Party Central Committee's May 4th Directive, led by the Central Direct Turnaround Team, tens of thousands of cadres throughout the region were successively organized to invest in the vast areas to continue the turnaround movement of last spring, setting off a movement upsurge to implement "land to the tillers." After the autumn, the in-depth movement, with filling gaps and making up deficiencies as the main content, has successively formed a climax in both old and new areas, achieving great results. Feudal landlords have been largely eliminated in various regions, and the extremely poor and poor peasants are gradually being eliminated. In the border areas and areas behind the enemy, experience in combining land reform with self-defense warfare has also been gained. However, it is still far from the entire goal of land reform, that is, completely abolishing the feudal landlord class and achieving an average and reasonable distribution of land. There are still many problems, such as cadres, activists, large tenant farmers, and former tenant farmers receiving too much land; some feudal vestiges of landlords have not been completely eradicated; and some backward masses have not been mobilized. As for the newly recovered areas, it is even more necessary to vigorously mobilize, and we must continue to solve these problems, and we must not be complacent and paralyzed. Experience has proven that we must conduct in-depth and repeated inspections and cannot be satisfied with superficial phenomena and "almost" thinking. We must resolutely implement it to the end and strive to completely solve the land problem within this year. The inspection team should carefully select typical cases, conduct investigations and research, understand the situation, and discover problems in order to help determine policies and continue to promote land reform. We hope that everyone will humbly learn from the masses together. Currently, fifteen comrades of the inspection team have already departed for Taiyue Shimin, Taihang Changzhi, Xingtai, Jinnan Jize, Nanhe, Guanxian, Guangping, and Jin-Lu-Yu Nanle and other counties to begin their work.

    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 4th】All parts of Jin-Sui are concentrating their efforts on carrying out land reform. Party, government, army, and civilian organizations at the border region level have successively drawn nearly three hundred cadres to form fifteen mass work teams, led by leading cadres at the border region level, to go to various places to assist in the work. In Zuoyun, Shuoxian, Youyu, Pinglu and other places in the Yanbei District, there are more than 500 cadres forming 30 work teams or working groups. Cadres and students from various training teams and schools have gone to the countryside one after another. In county-level organizations, in addition to leaving cadres to handle daily work, the main leaders have all gone deep into rural work. There are also work teams in the new districts of the Jinzhong Plain, with a total of more than 400 cadres, focusing on towns such as Wenshui, Xiaoyi, and Duijiu, to universally carry out land reform and liquidation movements; and issue agricultural loans to solve the production difficulties of farmers who have obtained land, and organize spring ploughing and large-scale production on the basis of land reform.

　　聂真同志谈土地改革情况
    号召深入反复检查
    年内彻底解决土地问题
    中央局土地改革考察团已出发
    【本报特讯】为贯彻土地改革，晋冀鲁豫中央局土地改革考察团，分三个组已于上月二十一日赴太岳、太行、冀南及冀鲁豫边地实地考察各地土地改革执行程度。在该团出发前，聂真同志就目前土地改革运动情况谈：在党中央五四指示号召下，以中直翻身队为首，全区先后组织了数万干部投入广大地区继续去春的翻身运动，掀起实行耕者有其田的运动热潮，秋后以填平补齐为主要内容走向深入运动，已在新老地区先后普遍形成高潮，获得很大成绩，各地封建地主大体消灭，赤贫和贫农正在逐步消灭中。在边地和顽后，土地改革也取得与自卫战争结合的经验。但距整个土地改革目的，即彻底取消封建地主阶级并达到平均合理分配土地，还相距很远。还有许多问题，如干部积极分子、大佃户、原佃户多分土地，还有部分地主封建尾巴未割净，一部落后群众未发动起来；至于新收复地区，更需要大力发动等问题，须要继续解决，不容我们自满麻痹。经验证明必须深入反复检查，不能满足于表面现象和差不多思想，要一直放手贯彻到底，争取今年一年内彻底解决土地问题。考察团应很好选择典型，调查研究，了解情况，发现问题，以作确定政策、继续推进土地改革的帮助；望我们大家共同虚心向群众学习。现考察团十五位同志已首途赴太岳士敏、太行长治、邢台，冀南鸡泽、南和、冠县、广平，冀鲁豫南乐等县开始工作。
    【新华社晋绥四日电】晋绥各地集中全力进行土地改革。边区一级党政军民各机关先后抽集近三百名干部组成十五个群众工作团，由边区一级主要负责干部率领分赴各地协助工作，雁北区之左云、朔县、右玉、平鲁等地，共有五百多干部组成三十个工作团或工作组，各训练队及学校员生均纷纷下乡，各县级机关除留干部处理日常工作外，主要负责人均深入农村工作。晋中平川新区亦有工作队，共四百余干部，以文水、孝义、兑九等城镇为重点，普遍开展土地改革与清算运动；并发放农贷，解决获地农民生产困难，在土地改革基础上组织春耕大生产。
