　　Taiyue Summarizes War Support Experience
    Military and Local Cadres Close Unity Guarantees Rapid Mobilization and Timely Demobilization
    [This Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 1st] Due to the enhanced political awareness of the masses after their emancipation and the unity between military and local cadres, war support work in Taiyue has made significant progress in the recent four months of the Self-Defense War. Its main characteristics are reflected in: First, rapid mobilization and timely demobilization. All localities have established organizations to support the front lines. Once the mobilization order was issued, the masses participating in the war immediately and automatically gathered in designated areas, overcoming the past phenomena of centralized and helpless gatherings in counties and districts. During the Quwo and Yicheng battles, Hongtong villages had hundreds of stretchers heading to the front lines in just one day. On the other hand, the logistics department constantly understood the commander's military intentions and decisions, and also ensured the timely dismissal and demobilization of the participating masses. After the Lingshi battle, the commander's decision was for the troops to reorganize, so the logistics department quickly allowed the participating masses from various localities to return home and participate in land reform, thus gaining the support of the masses. Second, political work was established to ensure that the participating masses maintained high morale from beginning to end. In the Yangcheng stretcher team, each company had an elementary school teacher as a propaganda officer, and small group meetings were held every day to review ideological life and continuously improve the ideological understanding of the masses. Before the Quwo and Yicheng battles, a small number of people among the participating masses in Yangcheng still had ideological problems such as "fear of death" or "long duration," and "being at home is better than going out," but after small group discussions, the masses straightened out their thinking themselves. The stretcher team of Zhongzhai Village discussed and concluded: "Our troops are confident in fighting, and the enemy is being beaten. If we listen to the command of the troops, we will not suffer losses. During the Quwo battle, the masses participating in the war in our Fourth District rescued the wounded on the front lines and were very safe." Han Shiying said, "Carrying the wounded is to defend the fruits of emancipation. Coming to Yicheng is to protect our Yangcheng. If the enemy in Yicheng is driven away, Yangcheng will be more consolidated." Tu Tou Xiaobai said, "Going out is certainly hard, but it is even harder if the die-hards are not defeated." Third, military cadres can unite and lead local cadres who participate in the war, which reduces desertion. Comrade Feng Tianfu of a certain regiment said to the local cadres: "Comrades, we have no experience and do not understand the situation of the masses. You are the leaders of the masses, so we rely on you to discuss things more." The mass work cadres of Regiment × always studied and resolved problems that occurred among the participating masses together with the local cadres. They did not easily allow local cadres and masses with little combat experience to go to dangerous places. When necessary, they also sent small troops to cover and protect their safety, fully demonstrating a sincere and democratic style of cooperation with local cadres. Therefore, the stretcher team they led did not experience desertion.

　　太岳总结战勤经验
    军队地方干部亲密团结保证动员迅速复员适时
    【本报太岳一日电】由于广大群众翻身后政治觉悟的提高和军队干部与地方干部的团结，太岳各地战勤工作在最近四个月的自卫战争中有显著的进步。其主要特点表现在：第一动员迅速，复员适时，各地都有了支援前线的组织。动员令一下，参战群众立即自动集中到指定地区，克服了过去在县区集中和手足无措等现象。曲、翼战役时，洪洞各村只一天有百付担架开赴前线。另方面后勤部门时刻了解指挥员军事意图和决心，对参战群众也做到了适时的遣散和复员。灵石战役后，指挥员的决心是部队整训，后勤部门就很快让各地参战群众复员回家，参加土地改革，因此得到群众拥护。第二建立了政治工作，保证了参战群众自始自终参战情绪的高涨。阳城担架队每个中队都有小学教员担任宣传干事，每天有小组会进行思想生活检讨，不断提高群众思想认识。曲、翼战役前，阳城参战群众中有很少数人思想上还有“怕死”或“日期长”、“好出门不如歹在家”等思想毛病，但经过小组会检讨，群众自己把思想打通了。中寨村担架队讨论结果说：“我们部队打仗有把握，敌人是挨打的，要听部队的指挥，就不会吃亏。曲战役咱四区参战群众在火线上抢救伤员，都很安全。”韩世英说：“抬伤兵是为保卫翻身果实，来翼城就是保咱阳城，翼城敌人打走了，阳城更巩固。”涂头小白说：“出门当然苦，可是不把顽固打掉，那才真苦。”第三军队干部能团结带领群众参战的地方干部，这就减少了逃跑。某团冯天福同志见到地方干部说：“同志咱可没有经验，也不了解群众情况，你们是群众领袖，这可靠你们有事多商量。”×团民运干事对于参战群众中发生的问题，总是与地方干部共同研究解决。对一般战斗经验不多的地方干部和群众，不轻易让他们到危险地方去，必要时还派小部队掩护保障其安全，充分表现了热诚与地方干部同心合作的民主作风。所以他们带领的担架队就没有产生逃跑的现象。
