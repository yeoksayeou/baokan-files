    Beiliu Teacher Wang Dongkui
    Uses Living Materials to Educate Children
    [This newspaper's Taihang 21st dispatch] Wang Dongkui, a teacher in Beiliu, Licheng, used living materials to conduct class education for children, which yielded great results. First, he had the children discuss the "Four-Character Classic for Peasants' Emancipation" published in the New China Daily. At noon, when they went home for lunch, two children (first-graders) went to watch the pigs. One was named Li Guowei (from a landlord's family), and the other was named Li Tuchen (from a poor peasant's family). During the watching, an argument arose. Tuchen said, "Pigs are like landlords, only eating and not working. They should be killed and eaten." Guowei said, "Pigs are like poor people, only eating bran and vegetables." The two quarreled and started fighting. From this, the teacher realized that class relations were very clear even among children. He seized this point to carry out education. In the afternoon, he asked the children to discuss who was right. Two factions formed during the discussion, and it was difficult to reach a conclusion. Many children said, "Pigs are like landlords, relying on others for food without working." Some said, "Pork can still be eaten, but landlords are useless, not even as good as pigs!" Wenkui said, "Landlords are ticks and bedbugs, only sucking the blood of us old peasants. If we want to live a good life after emancipation, we must eliminate the exploitation of the tyrannical landlords." After studying these issues, the children understood that feudal landlords were like ticks, eating human flesh and drinking human blood. Everyone should resolutely overthrow the landlords and divide the property with them. After the discussion, the landlord's daughter, Duan Guinu, wrote in her diary that her father should not have oppressed the peasant Shen Qingtang. When Li Sou solved his family's problems, he voluntarily took out his bracelet and returned the debt to the masses. Shen Xiande and Zhang Baigou (poor peasant boys) offered opinions and shouted slogans at the grievance meeting, showing great fighting spirit. This shows that using practical and living materials to carry out education has a great effect.

    北流教员王东魁
    用活材料教育儿童
    【本报太行二十一日电】黎城北流教员王东魁用活的材料给儿童进行阶级教育，收效很大。首先让儿童讨论了新华日报载的《农民翻身四字经》。晌午回家吃饭，有两个小孩（一年级生）同去看猪，一个叫李国伟（地主家孩），一个叫李土辰（贫农家孩）。在看的中间发生了争论，土辰说：“猪像地主，光吃不劳动，应该杀吃了他。”国伟说：“猪像穷人，光吃糠菜。”二人争吵着就打起架来。教员从此才了解了阶级关系在儿童里也表现的很清楚。即抓住这点来进行教育，下午就让儿童讨论他二人那个说的对。讨论中形成两派，争论不清，不少儿童都说：“猪和地主一样，都是靠人吃饭不劳动。”有的说：“猪肉还可以吃，地主没一点用，还不如猪哩！”文魁说：“地主是壁虱臭虫，光吸咱老农民血，我们翻身要过好光景，就要消灭恶霸地主的剥削。”研究这些问题后，儿童明确了封建地主是吃人肉喝人血和壁虱一样的东西，大家要坚决斗倒地主，和地主分家。地主女孩段闺女经过了讨论，自己在日记上写出他父亲不该压迫农民申庆堂的事；李叟在解决他家问题时，自动拿出他的手镯还了群众债。申献德、张白狗（贫农男孩）在开诉苦会时，又提意见又喊口号，斗争精神很大。从这里说明了用实际活的材料，来进行教育，作用很大。
