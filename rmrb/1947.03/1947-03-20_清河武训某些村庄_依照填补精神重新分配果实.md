[This report from our Jinan bureau on the 18th] During the land reform inspection in southern Hebei, villages with unfair distribution of fruits are re-distributing and replenishing. In the Hou Village of Niucheng in Qinghe, the reasons for the unfair distribution were reviewed, mainly due to the undemocratic work style of village cadres and the insufficient work of district cadres. After inspection, it was decided to re-distribute according to the spirit of replenishment, and the masses were extremely excited. Last year, in the anti-traitor and grievance campaign in the Fangtun Village of Wuxun, more than 100 mu of land and more than 37 shi of wheat were recovered. At the time of fruit distribution, those who wanted wheat could not have land. Because the poor peasants had nothing to eat, most only received wheat, and most of the land fell into the hands of middle peasants. The poor peasants who were not members of the association did not receive anything. After inspection and patient education, and after brewing discussions in various groups, the middle and poor peasants agreed to hand over the extra land to be distributed to the desperately poor. As a result, 31 poor households filled in three mu of standard land per person. The unity between middle and poor peasants has become stronger. Village cadres and some masses in Xipan Village of Longping borrowed fruits. The leadership immediately educated the village cadres, and they all took out the things. The masses who took more fruits also voluntarily handed them over when they saw the cadres withdrawing. Chen Yuanfa, the militia captain of Chen Wu Village in Yuan Dynasty, controlled 320,000 yuan of struggle funds and did not distribute them. He attacked anyone who gave him advice. After mobilization, he admitted his mistake to the masses and returned all the accumulated fruits.

　　清河武训某些村庄
    依照填补精神重新分配果实
    【本报冀南十八日电】冀南土地改革检查中，果实分配不公的村庄，都在重新进行分配填补。清河牛城后村，检讨分配不公原因，主要是村干作风不民主，区干工作不深入。经过检查，决定根据填补精神，重新分配，群众情绪极为兴奋。武训房屯村去年反奸诉苦中追回土地一百余亩，麦子三十七石多，当时分果实时，要麦子的不能要地，贫农因为没吃的，多只分到麦子，土地大部落到中农手里，会外的贫农一点也没分着。经过检查耐心进行了教育，并在各小组进行了酝酿讨论，中贫农都同意把多分的土地交出来分给赤贫。结果三十一户贫农每人填平标准地三亩。中贫农之间更团结了。隆平西潘村干和部分群众借用果实，领导上当即教育村干，都把东西拿出来，多拿果实的群众见干部退出，也自动交出来了。元朝陈伍村民兵队长陈元法，掌握了三十二万元斗争款不分，谁给他提意见他打击谁，经过动员，已向群众承认错误，退回全部积压果实。
