　　Taiyue District:
    Five Typical Examples of Combining Combat Support and Production
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 5th] The Taiyue Administrative Office saw several typical approaches emerge last year in combining combat support with production: First, the approach of labor hero Shi Zhenming's mutual aid team. When participating in combat support, one work unit replaced another, transporting four dou (60 li distance) of grain earned ten work points, with extra points awarded proportionally for those who carried more; transporting fifty hand grenades earned ten work points, with extra points also awarded proportionally. Carrying a stretcher earned ten work points, regardless of whether it was carried by four, three, or two people. At the same time, work tickets were used, and combat support work tickets could be exchanged for production work tickets. This method greatly conserved manpower, mobilized people to actively participate in combat support, and allowed the rear to engage in intensive farming, truly ensuring that those who produced, produced, and those who supported combat, supported combat, with men participating in combat and women engaging in production. As a result, Shi Zhenming's team also cultivated 2,210 mu of wasteland last year, and earned 430,000 yuan in ocean currency through transportation, chicken raising, and weaving.

    Second, the approach of Ji Guirong's mutual aid team in Dingyang Village, Qinyuan. After participants went out for combat support, the mutual aid group took responsibility for their household tasks, with wages reduced by half. Participation in combat support earned full work points, and the “drawing people by weight” method was implemented: two people carried the weight of three people, and within the mutual aid group, one person was drawn from every three with strong labor power, and one person was drawn from every four with weaker labor power. Those who stayed home took turns working for the combat support participants, ensuring that the participants were prioritized for plowing, hoeing, and harvesting. The cooperative also lent some money to the participants to carry while transporting goods, and the money earned was their own.

    Third, the approach of combining combat support and production by labor hero Shangguan Zhongyou’s team in Yanshan and the approach of Lujia River. Women and semi-laborers were organized for production. Last year during the autumn harvest, most of the male laborers had gone out to support the front lines. Women and semi-laborers were organized to do the major harvesting, and even old ladies were mobilized to do household chores, earning five work points. In addition, working on the land earned work points according to the work done, which encouraged labor. In the past, it took the entire village seven days to complete the harvest, but last year it was completed in five days. Those who went out to participate in combat support also earned work points, and accounts were settled with each other after they returned.

    Fourth, the labor-military combined work exchange of Du Balian in Jiyuan. Last year during the summer harvest, the entire village was divided into two parts: one part fought at the front while also engaging in production, and the other part engaged in production at the rear. The entire village worked together regardless of specialization, and wherever crops were ripe, they were harvested. After harvesting, crops were quickly threshed and hidden. Those fighting at the front also worked when there was no enemy activity, ensuring that the crops were threshed and stored in eight days, preventing the enemy from seizing a single grain.

    Fifth, the large-scale work exchange combining full and semi-laborers with combat support in Fangdui and Tuanbi villages, Hongdong. Tuanbi Village is ten li away from the city and five li away from a certain stronghold. Therefore, the scope of combining labor and military affairs was expanded, and guarding to monitor the enemy and scouting intelligence were also included in the work exchange. Women and children earned seven work points for guarding, and full laborers earned ten work points for fighting. Full laborers were needed for guarding or night sentry duty, which also earned ten work points. Working in the fields earned points based on labor, and in emergency situations, the work exchange was further expanded to village-to-village exchanges. Last year, in an emergency, the masses of Fangdui Village moved to North Tuanbi, and jointly fought and jointly labored with the village in a large-scale work exchange combining labor and military affairs, from joint defense operations to joint work exchange.

　　太岳区
    参战生产结合出现五种典型
    【本报太岳五日电】太岳行署在去年参战与生产结合方面，出现了几种典型：第一种是劳动英雄石振明互助大队结合办法，参战时一工顶一工，运粮四斗（六十里地）顶十分工，多担者接比例加分数；运手榴弹五十个顶十分工，多担者也按比例增加分数。担架一付顶十分工，不管四人或三人或两人，同样如此。同时使用工票，参选工票可以兑换生产工票，这种办法大大节省了民力，既能动员起积极参战，又使后方进行深耕细作，真正作到了生产的生产参战的参战，男人参战女人生产。因此，石振明大队去年还开荒二千二百一十亩，运输、养鸡、纺织赚洋四十三万元。
    第二种是沁源定阳村纪贵荣互助大队的办法，参战人出去后，家里的活由互助组负责，工资少出一半，参战顶全工，并实行“靠斤抽人”办法，两个人担三个人的斤秤，互助组内力量大的三人抽一人，力量小的四人抽一人，留在家里的人，给参战人轮流作活，保证参战人先犁先锄先收割。合作社还借给参战人一些钱捎带运输，赚下钱归自己。
    第三种岩山劳动英雄上官中有大队的芦家河的结合办法，组织妇女全半劳力生产，去年收秋时，大部分男劳力已出外支援前线，妇女全半劳力组织起来大收割，连老太太也动员起来，作家里活顶五分工。另外上地的按活顶分，鼓励了劳动；过去依靠全村劳力七天才能收割完，去年五天收割完毕。出外参战的人，同样顶工，回来后互相算账。
    第四种是济源杜八联的劳武结合大变工，去年夏收时，全村分两部分，一部分在前面打仗，捎带生产，一部分在后面生产，全村人打乱作活，那里熟就收割那里，收割后，快打快藏；前面打仗的人没敌情时也劳动，作到了八天场里光，没让敌人抢走一颗粮食。
    第五种是洪洞方堆、团壁村的全半劳力与参战大变工，团壁村离城十里，离××据点五里。因此劳武结合范围扩大，放哨监视敌人与侦探情报，也在变工之内，妇女儿童放哨顶七分工，全劳力打仗顶十分工，需要全劳力放哨或黑夜站岗也顶十分工，在地里作活以劳力顶分，在情况紧急时，更扩大到村与村变工。去年情况紧急时，方堆村群众转移到北团壁，就与该村劳武结合大变工，共同战斗共同劳动，从联防作战到联合变工。
