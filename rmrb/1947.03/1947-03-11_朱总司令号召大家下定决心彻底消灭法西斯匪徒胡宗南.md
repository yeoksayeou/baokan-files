Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: At the Yan'an All-Circles Defense of the Border Region and Defense of Yan'an Mobilization Meeting on the 8th, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's full speech:

　　Comrades, fellow compatriots of Yan'an:

　　Why are we holding this mobilization meeting today? Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan of the Kuomintang have returned the representatives we sent out, the envoys for peaceful negotiations; at the same time, they have arrested our people and some democratic progressives in Beiping, Chongqing, and other places. What are they doing? This means: no more talk of peace, we must fight, the door to peace has been shut tight.

　　Chiang Kai-shek wants to fight resolutely, we have no peace to talk about, so of course we can only fight. Today's mobilization meeting is to mobilize for war. In the past seven or eight years in our border region, the situation has been peaceful. Comrades have also fought the Japanese invaders and evacuated, but the enemy never came. Everyone has developed a deep sense of peace, and everyone thought that with Chairman Mao here, and with so many troops, the enemy would probably never come. This concept of peace must be corrected, and we must rise up to eliminate Hu Zongnan's offensive.

　　Hu Zongnan's offensive will first attack Yan'an. This attack is not only possible, but it is certain. What is the basis for this?

　　Hu Zongnan has already deployed troops in front of the border region, this is a fact; sending our representatives back, preparing to fight us for a long time, this is also a fact.

　　Comrades: Chiang Kai-shek has been fighting us for a long time! Although the people of Yan'an may not know much, you can see it in the newspapers.

　　In fact, we fought during the Anti-Japanese War, and we are still fighting after the end of the Anti-Japanese War. The year before last, Chiang Kai-shek invited Chairman Mao to negotiate for peace, but before Chairman Mao returned, fighting broke out in Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan.

　　This time we have been fighting for more than a year, and the battle lines stretch for tens of thousands of miles. Why tens of thousands of miles? The reason is that we are fighting village by village, thousands and tens of thousands of villages, you calculate how long the battle lines are.

　　Comrades, compatriots of Yan'an! Be vigilant and resolve to fight Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek has now sent troops, this is a true all-out offensive, he is using all his forces to fight a civil war. Battles are being fought in Shandong, Northeast, Hebei, Henan, and Jiangsu, and there will be fighting here too. Comrades did not believe in the past that the enemy would invade, but this time you must believe it, this is an all-out offensive, an all-out rupture.

　　Comrades! Do we have the confidence to defeat Hu Zongnan's offensive? Will we win? We will definitely win! Comrades have seen a lot in the newspapers, our newspapers are not fake, we eliminate one and count one. In these eight months, we have eliminated sixty-five brigades (that is, divisions), these are his regular troops, not counting his puppet army units. As far as we are concerned, we have already won victories. We have captured one hundred and twenty of his generals, not counting those killed.

　　We have won victories in the past, but not all places have won victories, there are also some places where we have been defeated. In places where we have fewer troops, such as Longdong, the enemy once occupied Qingyang, although we eventually drove them out, this counts as a defeat; when we drove them out and eliminated a thousand or so people, this was our victory again.

　　Winning a victory is not easy, it is not that hoping to win a victory will lead to victory, let alone hoping that others will win a victory while we enjoy the benefits. All the places that have won victories are those where we fight desperately, where the common people and the army fight desperately, where the regular army and the militia fight desperately, where everyone is of one mind, truly unafraid of death, then we can win a victory.

　　Therefore, comrades, we are confident of winning. But in some places, our troops have not yet been concentrated, and the enemy's troops have concentrated first, so they have invaded our territory, taken the food of the common people, eaten what they could, and burned what they couldn't, which counts as a defeat for us. Chiang Kai-shek has occupied one hundred and several tens of cities, and we have eliminated dozens of his brigades. Has he captured one of our generals? He hasn't said. Has he eliminated our army? We haven't seen him mention any unit numbers. However, we have captured one hundred and several tens of his generals and eliminated dozens of his brigades, so we are confident of winning.

　　Comrades, if we hope that others will win a victory but we do not take action ourselves, then victory will not be achieved. Chiang Kai-shek relies on American imperialism to help him fight, but last year alone, a considerable portion of his family property was seized by us. American imperialism has helped him with 400 million U.S. dollars to equip forty-odd divisions, we have fought against all of them, and the facts prove that American aid cannot save him from failure.

　　Comrades, let me tell you the method of winning victories. In Longdong, the enemy invaded and suffered losses; our militia fought very well, we defeated some of their troops, this is a good experience, and other places should learn from it. The Longxian militia also has good experience, and it should be expanded into the experience of the entire Yan'an sub-district. The militia should fight the enemy whenever they see them, which will make it easier for our regular army to concentrate its forces and eliminate the enemy. The militia's tactics are on the one hand to fight and eliminate the enemy, and on the other hand to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, laying mines everywhere, so that the enemy can't find anything when they come in, leaving only empty cave dwellings, they will be unable to advance or retreat, making it easier for us to eliminate them. The militia should actively fight, cooperate with the regular army, the regular army will fight better with the militia, and the militia will become bolder and bolder with the regular army. This time we are determined to win, we want to eliminate Hu Zongnan inside the border region, his arrival now is a very good opportunity to eliminate him. The terrain here is the best battlefield for the militia, with large mountains, deep forests, and few roads, good for fighting guerrilla warfare, one person can fight several of them in the mountains. If he sends a platoon or a company to search for you, by the time he arrives, you have already shifted your position. The best weapons for the militia are mines and hand grenades.

　　Our regular army is of course not dispersed everywhere, but must be concentrated and hidden, so that when the enemy comes, we can surround and eliminate them, and seize their weapons.

　　Every place must conscientiously do a good job of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, and the grain of every household must be properly buried and hidden, so that the enemy cannot find rice to eat, cannot find coal to burn. The more soldiers the enemy has, the more difficult it will be for them to advance or retreat, and they will be half-dead from exhaustion. Once the main force arrives, it will be easier to eliminate them. Therefore, strengthening the walls and clearing the fields is a task that our cadres in every place must do well, and we must notify and check every household to ensure that they do it conscientiously.

　　Comrades: We must prepare for a long-term war, fighting for a year or six months. If we still haven't driven them out, then we will fight for three or five years, until we eliminate Hu Zongnan, in order to cooperate with other liberated areas in striving for national victory. Comrades, today's mobilization meeting is to call on everyone to resolve to fight! We must fight thoroughly, so that national victory can come! Comrades, this is the meaning of our mobilization.

　　朱总司令号召大家下定决心彻底消灭法西斯匪徒胡宗南
    【新华社延安九日电】八日延安各界保卫边区保卫延安动员大会上，朱总司令讲话全文：
    同志们，延安各界同胞们：
    我们今天开动员大会，为什么动员？国民党蒋介石、胡宗南已把我们派出去的代表、和平谈判的使节送回来了；同时在北平、重庆各地逮捕我们的人和一些民主进步人士，这是干什么呢？这是说：不讲和平了，一定要打仗，已关死了和平的大门。
    蒋介石要坚决打下去，我们没有和平可讲了，当然也只有打下去。今天的动员大会就是动员打仗。过去我们边区七八年来，都是和平的局面，同志们也同日寇打过仗，也疏散过，但敌人总是没有来，大家和平的观念已养得很深了，大家都以为有毛主席在这里，同时我们又有这样多的军队，恐怕敌人永远不会来。这一和平观念要改正过来，要起来消灭胡宗南的进攻。
    胡宗南的进攻，首先要进攻延安，这次进攻不仅是可能的了，而且是一定的了。这有什么根据呢？
    胡宗南已调了军队在边区前面，这是事实；送我们的代表回来，准备长期和我们打仗，这也是事实。
    同志们：现在蒋介石同我们打了好久啊！延安的人虽不大知道，但从报上可以看到。
    事实上抗战时期也打，抗战完结后还是打。前年蒋介石邀请毛主席出去谈判和平，当毛主席尚未回来时，在河北、山西、河南就打起来了。
    这次已经打了一年多了，打仗的地方算起来，战线有几万里。为什么有几万里？这个道理就是一个村一个村的打，几千几万村，你们算算战线有多长。
    延安的同志们、同胞们！要警觉起来，决心和蒋介石打仗。蒋介石现在已调兵来了，这是真正的全面进攻，他用了全部的兵力来打内仗，在山东、东北、河北、河南、江苏都在打仗，这里也要打。同志们过去不相信敌人会打进来，这次一定要相信了，这已是全面进攻、全面破裂。
    同志们！打垮胡宗南的进攻有把握没有？会不会打胜仗？一定会打胜仗的！同志们已在报上看得很多，我们的报纸不是假的，我们是打一个算一个，这八个月消灭六十五个旅（也就是师），这是它的正规军，它的伪军团队还不算。这在我们说来，我们是已打了胜仗。俘掳了它的将官一百一二十个，打死的还不算。
    我们过去是打了胜仗，但不是各地方都打了胜仗，也还有些地方是打败了。我们兵少的地方，如像陇东，敌人曾经占去了庆阳，虽然我们终于把它打出去了，可是这要算一个败仗；我们把它打出去消灭了千把人，这又是我们的胜仗。
    打胜仗不是容易的事情，不是希望打胜仗就能打胜仗，更不是希望人家打胜仗，我们来享福。所有打胜仗的地方，都是自己拚命的，老百姓和军队个个拚命，正规军民兵都拚命，大家一条心，真正不怕死，就能打胜仗。
    所以，同志们，打胜仗是有把握的。可是有些地方我们的兵尚未集中，敌人的兵先集中了，便侵占了我们的地方，把老百姓的粮食抢去吃了，吃不完的烧了，这在我们就算是败仗。蒋介石占了我们一百几十个城市，我们消灭了他几十个旅。他捉到我们一个将官没有？他没有讲。消灭了我们军队没有？也没有见他讲出什么部队的番号。可是，我们却捉到了他一百几十个将官，消灭了他几十个旅，所以我们是有把握打胜仗的。
    同志们，我们如果希望人家打胜仗，自己不动手，这样胜仗就打不成。蒋介石打仗靠美帝国主义帮助，但去年一年，他的家务已被我缴了不小部从。美帝国主义前后帮助他四十万万美金装备他四十几个师，我们都打过了，事实证明美国的帮助也并不能挽救他失败的命运。
    同志们，让我告诉你们打胜仗的办法。在陇东，敌人打进来了，受了损失；我们民兵打得很好，我们打垮了它的一些部队，这是好的经验，别的地方应该来学。陇县民兵也有好的经验，应该将它扩大成为整个延属分区的经验。民兵见着敌人就打，那就很便于我们正规军集中力量消灭敌人。民兵的战法是一方面要打仗消灭敌人，另一方面要坚壁清野，到处埋起地雷，使敌人进来一点东西都找不到，只剩下空窑洞，他将进退不得，更便于我们消灭。民兵积极去打仗，要与正规军配合，正规军有民兵就会打得更好，民兵有了正规军也就愈打胆愈大。这次我们决心要打胜仗，要在边区里面消灭胡宗南，他现在来了，正是消灭他的很好的机会。这里的地形是民兵最好的战场，山大林深路少，好打麻雀仗，在山上一个人可打他几个人。他要派一排一连人来搜索你，可是等他来了，你又转移了阵地。民兵最好的武器是地雷、手榴弹。
    我们的正规军当然不是到处分散的，要集中隐蔽起来，等敌人来了好去包围消灭它，缴它的械。
    各个地方都要切实地作好坚壁清野工作，每一家的粮食都要好好埋藏起来，敌人来了找不到米吃，找不到炭烧，敌人兵愈多愈会感到进退两难，困也困个半死，大军一到，就更容易消灭。所以，坚壁清野是我们各个地方干部要作好的工作，要通知和检查每一家切实作好。
    同志们：我们要准备长期作战，打它一年半年，如果还没有打出去，就打它三年五年，一直把胡宗南消灭为止，以配合其他解放区争取全国的胜利。同志们，今天动员大会就是要大家下决心打！要打得彻底，全国胜利才能到来！同志们，这就是我们动员的意义。
