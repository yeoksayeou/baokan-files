Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Reports from various sources: After British Foreign Secretary Bevin condemned U.S. President Truman in the House of Commons for undermining the resolution of the Palestine issue, Truman declared on February 27th that he would insist on his "demand to immediately allow 100,000 Jews to enter Palestine." American conservative newspapers have also launched a massive attack on Bevin. The New York Times stated: "We dare not hastily judge whether Bevin's condemnation of Truman will benefit him personally; much of the Palestine issue is driven by emotion." A United Press reporter in New York reported fears that the intense struggle between Truman and Bevin might undermine the "U.S.-British front" at the Four-Power Moscow Conference in March.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 28th: Compiled from various sources: The conflict between Britain and the United States over the Palestine issue has recently intensified again. The British Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, prominently published on the 26th a statement made by British Foreign Secretary Bevin in the House of Commons debate on the Palestine issue. Bevin emphasized: "If the Palestine issue were simply a humanitarian problem of allowing 100,000 European Jews to immigrate to Palestine, it would be easy to handle. In reality, the difficulty arises because Jews – more American than Palestinian – intend to subvert what Britain considers the most thorough policy of implementing the mandate." Bevin claimed: "Truman's statement during last year's U.S. Congressional election campaign, calling for the immediate permission of 100,000 Jews to move to Palestine, undermined the opportunity to resolve the Palestine issue." Bevin also said: "Both Britain and the United States have been entangled in promises to the Arabs. The British government spent most of its time consulting with the U.S. government. When the U.S. government was unwilling to implement the recommendations of the Anglo-American Palestine Committee in July last year, Britain immediately took the initiative to propose a basis for discussion between the Arabs and the Jews." Bevin concluded: "Since the discussions were fruitless, the only way out is to submit it to the United Nations for approval of British trusteeship over the territory."

After Bevin's statement was published, a White House spokesman immediately issued a statement, considering the debate in the British House of Commons to be "extremely unfortunate and confusing," and denying that Truman's statement on the Palestine issue last year had "political motives."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 26th: Agence France-Presse, London, February 24th: The Standard Evening News announced in an editorial that the entire British Commonwealth occupation force stationed in Japan consists of 37,000 people, of which 13,000 belong to the United Kingdom. The newspaper requested that these troops be withdrawn. The newspaper stated: Overseas troops feel lonely. Although they are also occupation forces of the victorious nations, they can only exercise secondary rights (note: referring to being squeezed out by the United States), while the country is in dire need of manpower. The War Office announced on February 14th that it had decided to withdraw one brigade.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 28th: Washington dispatch: U.S. authorities have recently expressed concern about the India issue again. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall declared on the 25th that the U.S. government has fully assessed British Prime Minister Attlee's statement. However, Marshall insisted: "The internal crisis in India risks preventing India from realizing its contribution to maintaining international peace and prosperity. An India divided by internal strife can be imagined as only becoming a new source of international tension."

　　莫斯科会议开幕前夕
    英美矛盾日趋激烈
    贝文抨击杜鲁门对巴勒斯坦政策驻日英军受美排挤部分撤退回国
    【新华社延安二日电】各方讯：英外相贝文于下院谴责美总统杜鲁门破坏巴勒斯坦问题的解决后，杜鲁门于二月二十七日声明坚持其“即刻让十万犹太人进入巴勒斯坦的要求”，美各保守报纸复对贝文大肆攻击，纽约时报称：“贝文之谴责杜鲁门之举，对于他本人是否有所得，我们未敢遽下判断，关于巴勒斯坦问题多为意气用事”。合众社纽约记者则报导害怕杜贝之间的激烈斗争，可能破坏三月莫斯科四强会议上的“美、英阵线”。
    【新华社延安二月二十八日电】综合各方消息：英美在巴勒斯坦问题上的冲突，近又趋激烈。英工党机关报每日先驱报，二十六日以显著地位刊载英外相贝文在下院辩论巴勒斯坦问题时所发表之声明。贝文强调：称“如果巴勒斯坦问题只是让欧洲十万犹太人移入巴勒斯坦的单纯的人道问题，那倒是好办，实际上，困难之产生乃因犹太人——与其说是巴勒斯坦的，毋宁说是美国的——意图颠覆英国认为是最周密的实施委任统治的政策”。贝文声称：“杜鲁门于去年美国会竞选中，号召立即允许十万犹太人移至巴境的声明，破坏了解决巴勒斯坦问题的机会”。贝文又称：“英美双方曾为对阿拉伯人的诺言纠缠不清，英国政府大部分时间化在与美政府磋商，至美政府不愿实施去年七月的英美巴勒斯坦委员会之建议时，英国当即主动的提出阿拉伯人与犹太人讨论的基础。”贝文末称：由于讨论无结果，唯一的出路是提交联合国请其批准英国托管该地。
    贝文声明发表后，美白宫发言人立即发表声明，认为英下院之辩论是“极不幸并迷惑人的事”，并否认杜鲁门去年关于巴勒斯坦问题之声明有“政治动机”。
    【新华社延安二月二十六日电】法新闻社伦敦二十四日电：标准晚报于社论中宣布，大不列颠联邦驻日占领区全三万七千人，其中一万三千名属于联合王国，该报系请将这些军队撤回。该报称：国外驻军佥感孤寂，虽然他们也是战胜国的占领军，但只能行使次要权利，（按：指受美国排挤）而国内又极需人力，陆军部于二月十四日宣布，已决定撤回一旅。
    【新华社延安二月二十八日电】华盛顿讯：美国当局最近对印度问题又表示关切。美国务卿马歇尔二十五日宣称：美政府对英首相艾德礼之声明，有充分之估计。但马氏坚称：“印度的内部危机，有使印度无从实现其对维持国际和平与繁荣之贡献的危险，为内争所分裂的印度，可以想像到只能成为国际紧张的新根源。”
