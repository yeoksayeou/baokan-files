　　Carefully Formulate Individual Production Plans
　　Pay Attention to Commending Heroic Models at Any Time
　　Border Region Agencies Continue to Promote Production and Thrift
　　Normal Schools in Various Parts of Taihang Actively Engage in Production and Thrift
　　[Reported by our correspondents] Primary and normal schools in various parts of Taihang are responding to Comrade Bo Yibo’s call to launch a production and thrift campaign. Under the leadership of Principal Yang, the Shexian Normal School formulated a production and thrift plan for all comrades. Collective production focuses on agriculture, cultivating 35 mu of land, which is self-cultivated by teachers and students in groups to ensure self-sufficiency in vegetables. In addition, they opened an oil mill, raised six pigs, bought a mule and a donkey, and assigned one cook to handle transportation. Students take turns helping with carrying water and cooking, and the money earned is used to cover the school's miscellaneous expenses and provide assistance to poor students. In terms of thrift, each person in the school saves two liang of rice per day, and the three weekly noodle meals are reduced to one. In total, this saves 337 jin of rice per month. The school burns 180 jin of firewood per day, which is entirely supplied by students gathering firewood, saving 27,000 yuan per month. They also plan for all teachers and students to work together to build three rooms. At the Anyang First Primary School, after Principal Zhai Yaosheng proposed a production and thrift plan at the weekly meeting on the 17th of last month, all primary school students have automatically organized themselves. Female students have formed laundry and spinning groups, while male students have formed transportation, engraving, contracting, and odd-job groups. In terms of thrift, in addition to each person saving one liang of rice per day from meals, the principal, five teachers, and two cooks have voluntarily proposed "salary reduction," saving more than 100 jin of rice per month. The school plans to be fully self-sufficient in office expenses from March. The entire staff and students of the Border Region Jianye Accounting School launched a thrift campaign, saving more than 3,800 jin of millet, 690 square feet of homespun cloth, 10,000 Jichaocash (冀钞), and many shoes and socks. They also plan to reclaim wasteland to grow vegetables. Principal Wang Fenglai and five teachers opened a small barber shop, taking turns serving as barbers, and the money earned is used to cover the school's office expenses. Teachers in the Liyi School District of Lingchuan County held a teachers' meeting on the 14th of this month and returned to their villages to voluntarily reduce their salaries to the masses. Five of the 14 teachers, including Li Cunbao, reduced their monthly salary from 1.5 shi of rice to 2 jin of cotton, and the rest also reduced it to 7 dou. In total, this saves 75 shi and 6 dou of rice per year. (Jin Bo, Shu Ting, Zhi Quan, Fu Qin, Ming Peng, Wang Dao)
　　[Reported by our correspondent in Taihang] In order to respond to the call of "hard struggle, to meet the light," the Taihang Second Middle School has specially organized a textile factory, and purchased various machines and spinning wheels with loans from the government. There are currently 250 spinning wheels and 3 weaving machines, and production has begun. The entire school is in high spirits for production. (Dong Xu, Wei Yi, Si Jun)
