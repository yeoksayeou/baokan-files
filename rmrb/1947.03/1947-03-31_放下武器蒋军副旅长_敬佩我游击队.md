    [This dispatch from the Jiluyu Front, 29th] Ren Gaoqiangbin, the Kuomintang Army 47th Division 127th Brigade Deputy Brigade Commander and concurrently Director of the Political Department, who recently laid down his arms after being ambushed by the Jiluyu guerrilla forces, has now safely arrived in a certain rear area. Our reporter recently paid a special visit to him. According to him, the guerrilla force resolved the battle in just ten minutes. At 3 PM on the 15th, the car he was riding in was traveling from Changyuan to Jixian when it reached a location in Yanjin. Our guerrilla force was lying in ambush in a village 50 meters away from the road. As soon as they heard the gunfire, the guerrillas were already upon them, and they had nowhere to escape. Those who laid down their arms with Mr. Gao included, in addition to soldiers, Song Zuren, a lieutenant colonel section chief from the 47th Division, Cheng Yuan, a captain member, Liu Duojin, a second lieutenant adjutant, and Mu Hongchang, a second lieutenant member from the 41st Division. Gao himself was wounded at the time, a bullet piercing his wrist, and is now receiving medical treatment. He is 45 years old this year, from Changle, Fujian, and a graduate of the 8th class of the Baoding Military Academy, having enlisted in the military in 1926. He previously served as a regimental commander, battalion commander, military academy tactics instructor, and deputy division commander of the New First Division, among other positions. In the 35th Division, he served as Deputy Division Commander (i.e., Deputy Brigade Commander after reorganization) of the 127th Division, concurrently Director of the Political Department. He expressed great admiration for the bravery of the guerrilla forces in the liberated areas. He said, "The guerrillas strike with surprise and are impossible to defend against. The Kuomintang army entering the liberated areas is constantly on edge, afraid to take a blind step."
