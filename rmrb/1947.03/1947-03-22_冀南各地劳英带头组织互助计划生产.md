    Labor Heroes in Southern Hebei Lead
    Organization of Mutual Aid Production Plans
    [Our newspaper's Hebei South dispatch on the 20th] The emancipated peasants of Southern Hebei are actively preparing for spring plowing. The Old Shop Mutual Aid Team in Guangzong, under the leadership of labor hero Wang Chaozhu, has drawn up a spring plowing plan. This year, because the number of livestock has increased, a lot of grass is needed for feed, so it has been decided to plant more millet. The entire team will spring plow 36 hectares of land (in addition to 7 hectares of wheat fields), with plans to plant 18 hectares of millet and 8.5 hectares of cotton, including 9.5 hectares of sorghum, etc. Animal power alone is sufficient to complete the spring plowing task. If it is urgently necessary to rush to get out time for sideline production, manual labor can be added to carry out assault work. The fertilizer must be transported before the vernal equinox, and hoeing and harrowing should be carried out quickly. Since spring is long this year, millet is easy to get old, and sowing should not be too early, but can be sown after the Grain Rain period, depending on the situation. The entire team has a total of 92 laborers (including half-laborers), 32 cattle, and 4 donkeys, totaling 6,900 man-days and 2,575 cattle-days (two donkeys are equivalent to one cow) during the spring plowing period. However, the total spring plowing is estimated to require only 1,183 man-days and 1,033 cattle-days, leaving 5,717 man-days and 1,542 cattle-days to be used for sideline production such as leaching salt, ginning cotton, and transportation during the remaining time of spring plowing. The entire team plans to buy 15 cattle, reclaim 4 hectares of wasteland, and build 40 houses with the proceeds from sideline production this spring. Since the spring plowing plan was drawn up, three groups have already bought five cattle, and groups such as Wang Baoli and Guo Fengqi are actively breaking up firewood and rotten grass to make fertilizer. The salt leaching group, weaving group, and cotton ginning group are all producing in full swing. Some groups are using the distributed fruit wood to rush to make agricultural tools. The masses of Lin Village in Jize County responded to the call of "cultivating three and reserving one," and have organized 29 mutual aid teams. Among the more than 170 households in the village, 150 households have drawn up production plans, and each team is carrying out salt leaching, nitrate leaching, and weaving in full swing. Wu Qinggui's team has a total of eight households, and it is estimated that each household will be short of an average of 45 days of grain by the end of May, which they plan to solve through sideline production, and they are confident that they can buy one cow and two pigs from the profits of nitrate and salt leaching. Shi Decai, the old hero of Shengfotang in Wei County, has led the mutual aid teams to discuss mutual aid methods and is preparing to establish a "Labor Mutual Aid Cooperative" to unify planning and guide production. In order to solve the difficulty of animal power for spring plowing, 60 people in Qiyinxing Village, Zaoqiang County, have organized themselves to help each other in fishing. They have only fished five times and have already earned more than 100,000 yuan in silver dollars, which can buy two plowing cattle.

    冀南各地劳英带头
    组织互助计划生产
    【本报冀南二十日电】冀南翻身农民，积极准备春耕。广宗旧店互助联队在劳动英雄王朝柱领导下订出春耕计划。今年因牲口增多，须要很多草喂，故确定多种谷子，全联队共春地三十六顷（外有七顷麦地），计划种谷子十八顷，棉花八顷五十亩，其中高粱等九顷五十亩。只用畜力足可完成春耕任务，如急须赶出时间搞副业，可添助人工突击工作，春分前要把肥料运送完毕，很快进行锄地耙地。今年春长，谷子容易老，播种不宜过早，可在谷雨后看情况播种。全联队共劳力九十二个（半劳力折合在内），牛卅二头、驴四匹，总计春耕期间有人工六千九百个，牛工（两驴折合一牛）二千五百七十五个。但总计春耕不过共须用人工一千一百八十三个，牛工一千零三十三个，下余的人工五千七百十七个、牛工一千五百四十二个，利用春耕剩余时间，进行淋盐、轧花、运输等副业生产。全联队计划以今春副业生产买牛十五头，开荒地四顷，盖房四十间。自订出春耕计划后，已有三组买牛五头，王保理、郭凤岐等组都在积极打碎柴烂草沤。淋盐组、纺织组、轧花组都在紧张生产，有的组用分得果实木料赶制农具。鸡泽小寨林群众响应“耕三余一”号召，已组织互助组二十九个，全村一百七十多户，已有一百五十户订出生产计划，各组正紧张进行淋盐、淋硝、纺织。吴清桂组共八户，算至五月底，每户平均缺乏四十五天的粮食，准备从副业生产中解决，并有信心从淋硝、淋盐盈利中买牛一头、猪两只。威县圣佛堂老英雄石德才，已领导各互助组讨论好互助办法，并准备建立“劳动互助社”，统一计划，领导生产。枣强齐音兴村群众，为解决春耕畜力困难，已有六十个人组织起来互助捕鱼，仅捕了五次，已大洋十万余元，可买耕牛两头。
