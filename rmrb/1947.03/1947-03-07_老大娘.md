　　Old Woman

　　During the autumn harvest, the Second Sanitation Center was particularly busy. Each caregiver had to look after an average of two or three seriously wounded soldiers living in civilian homes. However, cadres in the center, in order to save civilian labor, would rather endure more hardship themselves than disturb the masses' autumn harvest.

　　The Second Sanitation Center was stationed in Hanwang Town, Zuoquan County. One day, the Chairman of the Hanwang Women's Relief Association and Li Bingliang, the Women's Squad Leader, were waiting at the village reception station for wounded soldiers to arrive. When there were few people, they would sit on the doorstep and chat. Suddenly, they saw a young comrade, carrying a kettle in one hand and a plate of hot steamed buns in the other, covered in sweat, walking past them towards the seriously wounded soldiers' rooms behind the center. They followed him in. As soon as the young comrade entered the door of the north room, the wounded soldiers in the south and west rooms began to shout: some wanted water, some wanted a bedpan. The young comrade was extremely busy, repeatedly promising, "Yes, yes, yes," but he couldn't get to everyone at once.

　　Bingliang said to the Chairman, "Look! This young comrade is busy with receptions day and night and still can't manage everything. What if he gets sick from exhaustion?" The Women's Relief Association Chairman said, "That's right! Now that we've seen it, we'll mobilize the women to come and take care of them tomorrow!"

　　After a night of mobilization, eighteen women from Hanwang participated in the caregiving work, and they started working in three groups that afternoon.

　　There was an old woman named Cao Qiunü, who was forty-seven years old. She wasn't home when the mobilization took place. That day, she was walking to the fields and passed by the entrance of the seriously wounded soldiers' rooms in the back street. She saw the young women busily taking care of the patients in the wards. She wanted to go in and see what they were doing. As soon as she entered the courtyard, she heard someone groaning and moaning in the north room. She followed the sound and went into the north room. More than a dozen wounded soldiers were lying on the kang. There was no one taking care of them at that moment. When the wounded soldiers saw her enter, some of them called out, "Old lady, please get me a bedpan, I need to have a bowel movement." Cao Qiunü saw that the person had lost a leg and thought to herself, "I still need to go to the fields," but she handed the bedpan over. She thought, "The comrades are injured and in pain, unable to eat or drink properly, and who is it for? Isn't it for us, the common people, to have a good life? If I hadn't come in, this comrade wouldn't even be able to get out of bed to relieve himself. They fought like this for us, how can we not take care of them for a while?" Thinking this, she took her small basket home and told her daughter-in-law, "I'm not going to the fields, I'm going to the ward to help."

　　In her caregiving, she was particularly diligent and considerate. The young women were a little embarrassed to handle bedpans, but Cao Qiunü said, "What's there to be embarrassed about? It's the same as if your own parents, children, or family members were sick." She helped the wounded soldiers go to the toilet. Sometimes she would even reach out and feel if the kang was cold, fearing that the wounded soldiers would catch a cold. She didn't just take care of one ward, she would go into several homes to check on them. As soon as she heard someone calling out, she would run over and ask, "What do you need?" "What can I do for you?"

　　One comrade, who had a serious injury to his waist, couldn't turn over and was in so much pain that he couldn't eat, and tears streamed down his face. She stood by his side and kept begging, "Comrade! Eat a little more, if your stomach is full, the wound won't hurt so much!" As she spoke, she used a towel to wipe his tears. After she fed him, the pain was indeed a little lighter. That wounded soldier said to everyone, "This old woman takes care of me even more kindly than my own mother!"

　　It rained, and the kangs the wounded soldiers were lying on were very cold. If they used firewood to heat them, the rain had soaked the firewood, and it wouldn't light. The old woman ran back to her own home and brought two quilts for the wounded soldiers to put on the kangs. The wounded soldiers ate steamed buns, pork, cabbage, and tofu every day. After a long time, some of them didn't want to eat it anymore and wanted to drink yellow bean porridge. The old woman ran home and asked her youngest daughter to make a large earthenware pot of it. As soon as she entered the door of the north room with it, she was unexpectedly met by the young caregiver, who said to the old woman, "What are you carrying, old lady? We don't allow people to give the wounded soldiers things to eat randomly. If you give them something to eat again, you'll be responsible for all of their meals." The old woman was afraid to go inside and turned to leave. But the wounded soldiers all shouted, "Old woman, bring it back, we want to drink it, don't mind him." The caregiver saw that it was porridge and let her in. One wounded soldier had a bowl, another had a bowl, and in a short while, they drank it all up. The old woman saw that they were drinking it with relish and made another pot, and they drank that too. The old woman said, "As long as you want to drink it, I'll cook you several more pots. This yellow bean porridge is nothing." Everyone shouted in unison, "Give the old lady money, thank you, old woman."

　　After taking turns caring for them for three days, the old woman returned home, but almost whenever she had free time, she would go and visit the wounded soldiers again. When she went, she always asked, "Do you have any difficulties? Is the kang cold? What do you want to eat? I'll go home and make it for you." She also took out her own savings and bought ten boxes of Red Star cigarettes, giving them out, three to one, five to another. The old woman said, "These children are here, it's nothing! If you don't have money for a while, it's not difficult for me at home, spending a little makes me feel at ease." The wounded soldiers said, "Old woman, don't buy us anything to eat next time, save the money for the children, we have public supplies!" The old woman replied, "This is a little bit of my heart, don't dislike it."

　　Wounded soldier Jilin's younger brother came to see him. His injury was almost healed. He sent his younger brother to the street to buy ten cakes and asked his younger brother to help him visit the old woman. The old woman made them egg noodles with gravy and they ate a meal. When his younger brother was about to leave, Jilin said, "When you go home, be sure to tell our parents and family that I am doing very well here, thanks to the old woman's care. My wound is healing quickly! It's all thanks to this old woman's service, our whole family must not forget the old woman." The comrades who recovered and went to the front line also said, "We must fight well, if we don't win the victory, we'll be letting the old woman down!"

　　老大娘
    秋收中，卫生二所特别忙碌，每个看护员平均要照护两三个人家里住的重彩号。但所内干部们为了节省民力，宁愿自己多吃些苦，也不想打搅群众们的秋收。
    二所驻在左权寒王镇上。有一天寒王妇救主席，和妇女中队长李丙良在村招待所里待招来往彩号，人少的时候，她两坐在门限上扯闲话。忽然看见一位小同志，一手提着开水壶，一手端着一盘热腾腾的大蒸馍，满头大汗，从她们身边走向所后的重彩号房。她俩跟着进去，只见那小同志刚一进北房门，南房、西房的彩号们，都叫喊起来：有的要喝水，有的叫给拿尿盆。小同志忙个不停，口口声声的答应着：“有，有，有”，但却不能一下子轮流到。
    丙良对主席说：“你看！这小同志黑明白日忙着招待，还照护不过来，他要累病了，可怎么办？”妇救主席说：“可不是么？咱俩既然见了，明天就动员妇女们来照护！”
    经过一夜动员，寒王的妇女们有十八个人参加看护工作，当天下午就分三组工作起来了。
    有一个老太婆，叫做曹秋女，年纪有四十七岁了。动员时候，她不在家，这天正往地里走，路过后街重彩号房的门口，看见小媳妇们在病房里来来往往殷勤的照护着。她想进去看一看做啥哩。刚走进当院，听着北房有人在哼呀、哼呀的叫喊着。她随声音走进北房一看，炕上躺着十多个彩号，屋里这时没有人看护，彩号们看见她进去了，就有人叫：“老太太给我拿拿尿盆吧，我要大便。”曹秋女一看，那人一条腿没有了，嘴里说呐：“我还要下地呢”，顺手就把尿盆端了过去。一面想着：“同志们，受了伤疼的吃不能吃，喝不能喝，是为了谁呢？还不是为了咱们老百姓们过好时光吗？我要是不进来，这个同志就连小便都不能下地去。人家为咱打成这个样子，咱怎么能不伺候人家一会呢？”想着想着就把小箩头捎回家里，告媳妇说：“不去地了，我到病号房招待哩。”
    她在看护中，特别殷勤贴实。端尿盆的事，小媳妇们不大方便，可是曹秋女说：“那怕啥哩，自己爹娘儿女病了还不是一样。”她扶助着彩号们去大小便。有时还伸手去试一试炕冷不冷，怕彩号们受了凉。她不只看护一个病房，好几个人家他都进去看一看。一听有人喊叫，她就跑过去问：“要什么哩！”“做什么哩？”
    有一位腰上带了重彩的同志，不能翻身，又痛得不能吃饭，眼里流泪。她站在身旁一直央告：“同志！少吃上些饭，肚里饱了，伤口就不疼啦！”说呐又用手巾给他擦眼泪。喂了饭，果然痛得轻一点了，那彩号给大家说：“这位老大娘，真比俺亲娘照看得还亲哩！”
    天下雨了，彩号们躺的炕冷的很，用柴火烧吧，雨把柴淋的水溜溜的烧不着。老大娘便跑回自己家里拿来两条被子，给彩号们铺上。彩号们每天吃蒸馍和猪肉白菜豆腐，日子久了，有些不想吃，想喝黄豆稀饭。老大娘跑回家去叫小闺女给做了一大沙锅。她端着刚进了北房门，不想竟被小看护碰见了，便对老大娘说：你这老人家端的啥？不叫乱给彩号们吃东西，你又给吃了，以后就把这一伙人的饭都管起来。说得老大娘不敢给往里进，返身要走。可是彩号们都叫起来：“老大娘端回来，我们喝哩，不管他”。看护看是稀饭，也就让她进来。彩号你一碗，他一碗，不大一会就喝了个净。老大娘看见他们喝的很香，又做了一锅也喝啦。老大娘说：“只要是你们想喝，我给你们多熬几锅。这黄豆稀米饭不打紧。”大家一齐喊：“给老太太钱，谢谢老大娘”。
    轮流看了三天，老大娘回家后，差不多还是一有闲空，就要去看彩号们一回。去了总是问：“你们有啥困难，炕冷不冷，想吃啥我回去给你们做”。又拿出自己的积蓄钱，买了十盒红星纸烟，给他们分开你三支他五支的吸了。老大娘说：“这伙孩们来，没啥！你们一时没钱，我在家不作难，花几个我心里安。”彩号们说：“老大娘，下回可不要给买吃的，留着钱给小孩们吧，我们有公家供给哩！”老大娘回答：“这是我一点心，不要嫌孬。”
    彩号继林的弟弟来看他，他伤快好了，他打发弟弟去街上买了十个饼子，叫弟弟扶着去看望老大娘。老大娘给他弟兄俩做了鸡蛋卤面条，吃了一顿。弟弟临走时，继林说：“你回家了，千万告给咱爷娘家人说：我在这里很好，有老大娘照看哩。伤口快好啦！都是这老大娘侍候好的，咱一家都不要忘了老大娘。”伤愈再上前线的同志们也说：“要好好打，不打胜仗对不起老大娘！”
