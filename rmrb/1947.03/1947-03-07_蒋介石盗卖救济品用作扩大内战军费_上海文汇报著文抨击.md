Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 5th: Regarding the National Government's request to UNRRA to exchange $200 million USD worth of relief goods for cotton and wheat that can be sold on the Chinese black market, the Wenhui Daily recently published an article criticizing this, stating: "This is a transaction between the National Government and the U.S. State Department. UNRRA and CNRRA are merely their mouthpieces. Following a 70-minute conversation between the National Government's ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, and Marshall on February 17th regarding 'resolving China's economic crisis,' the Associated Press immediately reported that the National authorities had requested UNRRA to change its $200 million relief plan. This is clearly a disguised loan of 500 million yuan, using the $200 million originally intended for post-war industrial and agricultural equipment to purchase cotton and wheat, in order to sell it on the Chinese market for $500 million." The newspaper also stated: "After this fact was revealed, the UNRRA security chief blamed the press for prematurely disclosing the news, embarrassing UNRRA and the Chinese government." The Wenhui Daily pointed out that although the National authorities have tried their best to deny this, the statements of UNRRA Director Rooks and CNRRA confirmed it. As for the amount of this fund, Rooks stated on the 19th that the National Government requested $200 million, suddenly changed to $49 million on the 20th, and then changed to $19 million on the 21st. UNRRA's statements changed again and again, and they cannot be blamed for this, because all of these are transactions between the Chinese Chiang government and the U.S. State Department, but it is certain that the National Government is preparing to "sell relief supplies and use the money to continue the civil war." The newspaper further pointed out that the cotton relieved by UNRRA is all sold to Song Ziwen's "China Textile Company," which is a win-win situation for the National Government. The newspaper stated that UNRRA and the National Government have not only been fiercely criticized by Chinese and American newspapers and public opinion, but also opposed by American congressmen. American Congressman Belludes believes that "the U.S. government cannot allow Chinese black market merchants to get rich from relief supplies." In addition, UNRRA personnel in Shanghai pointed out with even greater indignation that Chiang Kai-shek's carefully planned conspiracy will eventually be realized, and "plowshares will eventually be made into swords." Reuters said that this "is truly a move that will astonish the world."

　　蒋介石盗卖救济品用作扩大内战军费
    上海文汇报著文抨击
    【新华社延安五日电】关于国民党政府要求联总将二万万美元救济物换为可在中国黑市出售之棉花与小麦一事，文汇报顷著文予以抨击称：“这是国民党政府与美国国务院之间的交易，联总与行总不过是他们的传声筒罢了。在二月十七日国民党驻美大使顾维钧与马歇尔作了七十分钟的“解救中国经济危机”谈话后，紧接着合众社便传出国民党当局要求联总改变二万万美元救济计划的消息，这显然是一种变相的五亿元借款，以原购工农业善后器材的二万万美元购买棉麦，以便以五万万美元价格在中国市场抛售。”该报又称：“此项事实被揭露后，联总警长曾责备报界过早揭露此消息，使联总及中国政府受窘”。文汇报指出：国民党当局虽竭力否认此事，但联总署长鲁克斯和行总的声明证实了它。至于这笔款项的数目，鲁克斯十九日声明中称：国民党政府要求者为二万万美元，二十日忽改称四千九百万，二十一日又改为一千九百万。联总声明中一变再变，这也怪不得他们，因为所有这些都是中国蒋政府与美国务院之间的交易，但国民党政府准备“变卖救济物资将所得的金钱来继续内战”，这点是可确定的。该报复指出联总救济的棉花，都是售给宋子文的“中国纺织公司”的，这是对国民党政府一举两得的事。该报称：联总与国民党政府不仅遭到中美报纸舆论之猛烈抨击，且亦遭到美国会议员之反对。美国会议贝卢德斯认为：“美国政府不能允许中国黑市商人借救济物资致富”。此外，上海联总人员更愤慨指出，蒋介石处心积虑的阴谋终将实现，“犁锄终被造成利剑”，路透社则称此“诚为令全世界惊异之举”。
