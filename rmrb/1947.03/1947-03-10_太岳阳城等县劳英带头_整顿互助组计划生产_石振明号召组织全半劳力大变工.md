[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue, dated the 8th] Yangcheng, Jincheng, Shimin, Gaoping, Changzi, Tunliu, Qinyuan, Qinshui, Fushan, and the bordering areas of Jiyuan and Wangwu in eleven counties are universally rectifying and organizing mutual aid, establishing plans for prosperity. In a few places, the work of delivering manure and building ridges has already begun. One ten-person team in the Nanlang village in Shimin that had been liberated in the land reform movement had delivered 740 loads of manure in seven days starting from the fifth day of the second lunar month. Manure for the entire village can be delivered in five days. The prosperity plans that have been established in various locations all aim to achieve “cultivating three and saving one,” and some places aim to achieve “cultivating one and saving one.” Shangguan Zhongyou, a labor hero from Yanshan, has six teams aiming to achieve “cultivating one and saving one.” His approach is to strengthen intensive cultivation, plowing three times and hoeing four times, applying an average of 70 loads of manure on mountainous land and 45 loads on flat land, combined with sideline occupations such as raising 81 pigs, 145 sheep, 549 chickens, 18 beehives, as well as transportation and weaving.

During this rectification of mutual aid, various heroes played a leading role, and the method of combining participation in the war effort with production was also emphasized. After completing the land reform, labor heroes Shi Zhenming, Zhao Meiying, and Zhao Rongzhi immediately convened a meeting of heroes and activists, emphasizing the organization of full and semi-labor forces for large-scale labor exchange and initiating competitions to organize 100% of the labor force (last year it was 95%). They also organized 70% of the women to participate in supporting the front lines, not only ensuring that men fight and women farm but also striving for women to participate in supporting the front lines when necessary. Shangguan Zhongyou, a labor hero from Yanshan in Yangcheng, and Liu Jinrong, a labor hero from Dongjiashan in Shimin, in addition to leading the entire village in establishing prosperity plans, also emphasized the organization of women and children. Yanshan aims to fully organize all 338 female full laborers (including the equivalent in female semi-laborers) to support the front lines and conduct intensive cultivation. Hao Buyun, a militia hero from Ma Zhu, one of the Du Ba Li's, in Jiyuan, led the entire village in organizing mutual aid teams to fight and produce simultaneously. Many liberated heroes are enthusiastically engaged in mutual aid, aiming for a complete turnaround.

　　太岳阳城等县劳英带头
    整顿互助组计划生产
    石振明号召组织全半劳力大变工
    【本报太岳八日电】阳城、晋城、士敏、高平、长子、屯留、沁源、沁水、浮山及边沿区的济源、王屋等十一县，普遍进行整顿与组织互助，订立发家计划，在少数地方已开始送粪垒堎。士敏南朗翻身互助组一个十人的小组，从阴历二月初五起，七天送出粪七百四十担，全村粪五天可送完。各地所订的发家计划，都要做到耕三余一，有些地方要作到耕一余一。岩山劳动英雄上官中有六队要作到耕一余一，他的办法是加强精耕细作，犁三遍锄四遍，山地平均上粪七十担，平地上粪四十五担，结合副业，养猪八十一个，羊一百四十五只，鸡五百四十九只，蜂十八窝以及运输纺织。
    这次整顿互助中，各种英雄起了带头作用，还着重讨论了参战与生产结合的办法。劳动英雄石振明、赵美英、赵荣智在完成土地改革后，随即召开英雄与积极分子会议，强调组织全半劳力大变工，并发动竞赛，把所有劳力百分之百组织起来（去年为百分之九十五）。并组织百分之七十妇女参加支援前线，不仅作到男人打仗女人种地，还要争取到妇女必要时也参加支援前线工作。阳城岩山劳动英雄上官中有、士敏董家山劳动英雄刘锦荣，除领导全村订立发家计划，也强调了组织妇女儿童。岩山要把女全劳力三百三十八个完全组织起来（女半劳力折合在内），才能作到支援前线与深耕细作。济源杜八联之一的马住民兵英雄郝步云，领导全村组织了互助组，一面打仗一面生产，许多翻身英雄更是兴致勃勃闹互助，要彻底翻身。
