The local armed forces and militia in Hongtong, Lingshi, Huoxian, and other counties along the Tongpu Railway are actively protecting land reform. When Hongtong County began land reform, the Second District still had two strongholds, Subao and Hanlue, where Chiang's troops, with a force of three companies, were stationed and frequently harassed the area. Therefore, the entire district was divided into seven groups (each group consisting of three to five villages). The four groups of Hanlue, Shangzhai, Guluo, and Licun surrounded the enemy in Hanlue. The original three groups of Shangxiaqiu and Shangxiayu cooperated with the First District to surround Subao. From January 5th to 27th, they trapped the enemy in Hanlue, forcing them to leave. The rear then carried out land reform. Licun, which is two miles away from Subao, also distributed the land of special agents and landlords Ji Weixian and Yang Yuanying, so that the landlords and bullies in the enemy strongholds dared not retaliate. In Yuantou Village, the Third District of Huoxian County, which is only ten miles away from the enemy's Zhangjiabao, the masses are still vigorously settling accounts with the landlord Han Deli. The militia and self-defense forces patrol the mountains day and night to protect the masses' struggle. The fruits of the struggle are distributed as they are obtained, especially grain and clothing, distributed during the day and distributed at night.

　　洪洞等县民兵地方武装
    包围据点掩护分田
    【本报太岳八日电】同蒲线上洪洞、灵石、霍县等县地方武装与民兵积极掩护土地改革。洪洞全县在开始土地改革时，二区尚有苏堡与韩略两个据点经常驻有蒋军三连兵力，四出袭扰。因而便将全区划为七个集团（每个集团三、五村不等），以韩略、上寨、古罗、李村四个集团围困韩略敌人；原上下邱、上下峪三集团配合一区围困苏堡，自一月五日至二十七日，把韩略敌人困走了。后方则进行土地改革，距苏堡二里的李村，亦分配了特务地主吉维贤、杨原英的土地，使敌据点内的地主、恶霸亦不敢倒算。霍县三区源头村，距张家堡敌仅十里，群众仍轰轰烈烈的与地主韩德礼进行清算；民兵自卫队日夜巡逻在山头掩护群众斗争，果实随斗随分，特别是粮食与衣物，白天斗白天分，黑夜斗黑夜分。
