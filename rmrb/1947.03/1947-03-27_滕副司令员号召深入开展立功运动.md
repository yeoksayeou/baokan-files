    Deputy Commander Teng Calls for Deepening the Merit Campaign
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On March 13th, at the merit mobilization meeting of the military region's directly subordinate units, Deputy Commander Teng of the military region called for a broad and deep merit campaign to accelerate the victory of the war. Deputy Commander Teng first pointed out: "The merit campaign for the people is a major creation in this patriotic self-defense war. The Yan'an Liberation Daily has issued several calls for it. Now this campaign has been widely launched throughout the Party, the army, and all liberated areas. The troops and local areas in this region have also responded enthusiastically and have achieved great results in frontline battles and in the guerrilla warfare in the bordering areas of the occupied territories. It has also attracted great attention in the military region's directly subordinate units. Today's meeting is to further mobilize and organize every unit and every department of our directly subordinate units, and to involve them in this large-scale campaign." Deputy Commander Teng further pointed out: "To earn merit for the people is the most active and concrete manifestation of serving the people. If all cadres and soldiers, Party members and non-Party members, recognize that earning merit for the people is our glorious task, and everyone strives to earn merit for the people, contributing all their strength to the revolution and the war, thereby increasing the efficiency of current work by one to several times, and making it universal to all departments of the Party, the army, and the region, becoming a huge mass movement, then our strength will be unparalleled. We will be able to overcome all difficulties, shorten the war time, and quickly win the victory of the self-defense war. Therefore, the merit campaign is a mass movement, a movement to mobilize and unleash the human, material, and intellectual resources of the military and civilians throughout the region, strengthen war efforts, and strive for victory. It should become our new leadership method and best way of working to win victory."
    Speaking about how to carry out the merit campaign, Deputy Commander Teng said: "We must implement the mass line, mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. To this end, we must first mobilize the masses ideologically, make them fully understand the nature of the self-defense war, raise their political awareness, and consciously contribute all their strength to the self-defense war. This requires ideological preparation from the bottom up. After the preparation is complete, formulate personal merit plans and launch merit competitions. In terms of leadership, it is necessary to promote democracy, not to replace or monopolize, but to value the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, rely closely on the masses, and carry out merit competitions, conduct merit inspections and summaries through the masses; and conscientiously grasp the principle of more praise and less criticism, praising models, discovering heroes, especially discovering those heroes who work hard silently. In this way, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses can be truly developed. Secondly, we must implement the leading role of activists, especially leading cadres." Deputy Commander Teng pointed out: "Earning merit is not only the business of soldiers and lower-level cadres. Leading cadres at the battalion, regiment, brigade (sub-district), column (military region), and department levels should also earn merit for the people. If they stand outside the merit campaign and shout for their subordinates to earn merit, the merit campaign will not be successful. Therefore, it is even more important for leading cadres to earn merit for the people, because they are leading cadres. If they lead the work of a department well, everyone will work very actively, united, and with high morale, and complete tasks quickly and conscientiously, then the entire work will be greatly advanced, and the enemy will be more effectively hit."
    Finally, Deputy Commander Teng called on everyone: "We must be good at using this new leadership method of the merit campaign, widely carry out and deepen the merit campaign among all personnel of the Party, government, military, and civilians, and greatly improve our existing combat effectiveness, work capacity, and productivity. We will surely be able to accelerate the victory of the war and completely eliminate the reactionaries."

    滕副司令员号召深入开展立功运动
    【本报特讯】军区滕副司令员三月十三日，在军区直属队立功动员会议上号召广泛开展和深入立功运动，加速战争胜利。滕副司令首先指出：“为人民立功运动，是此次爱国自卫战争中重大的创造，延安解放日报已经有几次号召，现在这个运动已经在全党全军全解放区普遍开展起来了，本区部队和地方亦已热烈响应，在前线战斗中，在坚持沦陷区边沿区游击战争中，都已取得巨大成绩；在军区直属部队中，亦已引起了极大注意。今天这个会议，就是要把我们直属部队的每一单位，每一部门都能进一步充分发动起来，组织起来，卷入到这个大规模的运动中去。”滕副司令员继又指出：“为人民立功，就是为人民服务最积极最具体的表现，如果不论干部战士，党员非党员，都认识到为人民立功，是我们光荣的任务，大家争着为人民立功，把自己的全副力量，贡献给革命和战争，因而把现有的工作效率提高一倍到数倍，并使之普遍到全党全军全区的一切部门，成为巨大的群众运动，那么我们的力量是无可比拟的，我们就能克服一切困难，缩短战争时间，迅速赢得自卫战争胜利。所以立功运动，就是一个群众运动，是动员和发挥全区军民的人力物力智力，加强战争努力，争取胜利的运动，它应成为我们争取胜利的新的领导方法和最好的工作方式”。
    谈到如何开展立功运动，滕副司令员称：“必须实行群众路线，发动群众的积极性和创造性，为此，必须首先从思想上发动群众，使群众充分了解自卫战争的本质，提高群众的政治觉悟，自觉的贡献自己的全部力量于自卫战争，这样就要从下而上的进行思想酝酿，酝酿成熟以后，订出个人立功计划，开展立功竞赛，在领导上则须发扬民主，不是代替包办，而是宝贵群众的热情和创造，紧紧依靠群众，通过群众来开展立功竞赛，进行立功检查和总结；并认真掌握多表扬，少批评，表扬模范，发现英雄，尤其发现那些埋头苦干的英雄，这样，群众的积极性、创造性才能真正发扬起来。其次，必须实行积极分子带头尤其是领导干部带头。”滕副司令员指出：“立功不仅是战士和下级干部的事，营、团、旅（分区）纵队（军区），部处局科的领导干部，同样应为人民立功，如自己站在立功运动之外，高叫下级立功，立功运动就搞不好，所以领导干部为人民立功，还更加重要，因为他是领导干部，他把一个部处局科的工作领导好，大家工作很积极，很团结，情绪很高，完成任务迅速认真，那么，整个工作就能大大推进，就能更有力的打击敌人。”
    最后，滕副司令员向大家号召：“我们必须善于使用立功运动这一个新的领导方法，在党政军民的全体人员中广泛开展和深入立功运动，把我们现有的战斗力，工作力，生产力大大提高一步，我们必能加速战争的胜利，把反动派彻底消灭。”
