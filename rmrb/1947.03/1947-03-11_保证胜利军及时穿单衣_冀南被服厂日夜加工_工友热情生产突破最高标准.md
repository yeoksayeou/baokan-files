(Our Jinnan dispatch of the 7th) Under the slogan of "Ensuring the Victory Army is clothed in time for Summer," a wave of intense work has swept through the military region's clothing factory. According to the original summer clothing task, the standard for the cutting team was 150 sets per case per day, and the highest standard for each sewing machine was 14 sets per day (half as much again as in previous years). Thanks to everyone's efforts, the output in the past half month has broken through the original highest standard, and now each machine produces an average of 20 sets per day. The workers have shown a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm. Many of the machines are old, and five or six machines often break down every day. They consciously and voluntarily get up early and go to bed late to rush to work. Even the worst of the three shifts do not do less work. On average, each person has to work 12 to 14 hours a day. The second shift proposed a competition to the fifth shift. In order to strive for meritorious service, comrades Zhao Hengrong and Gu Shiguo worked despite having hemorrhoids. Zhang Jingbo persisted in working even though his hands were swollen from fatigue. Comrade Ji Desheng, the managing sergeant, saw that the workers were so tense, so he specially convened a meeting of the cooks to discuss improving their living conditions. Labor hero Wu Zhanbiao said: "I have never been so nervous when working on my own farm at home, nor have I been so united and loving with my own brothers. I think this is all for the sake of quickly winning victory."
　　
(Further dispatch) After hearing the news of the military region's clothing factory's intense work, all the workers in the Tenth District sewing workshop were unwilling to fall behind, and also launched an enthusiastic meritorious service competition. They also formulated a half-month production plan: 1. Speed up the sewing machines; the two-person cutting team must cut 250 to 300 sets of clothes per day to ensure no waste of materials. 2. The summer clothes must be sewn firmly to ensure that they do not come unstitched. They unanimously proposed to challenge the military region's clothing factory.

　　保证胜利军及时穿单衣
    冀南被服厂日夜加工
    工友热情生产突破最高标准
    【本报冀南七日电】在“保证前方胜利军及时穿上单衣”口号下，军区被服厂掀起紧张工作浪潮。按今年夏衣任务原定裁班每个案子每天裁出一百五十套为标准，缝衣机每架每天以出产十四套为最高标准（比往年提高半倍）。在大家努力下半月以来的出产量，突破了原订的最高标准，现在每架机子一天出产均增到二十套。工人们表现了高度的革命热情，很多机子都是旧的，每天常有五、六架机子发生故障，他们就自觉自愿的早起晚睡赶工，三班机子最坏他们并不少做，平均每人每天都要工作十二小时到十四小时。二班向五班提出竞赛。为争取立功，赵恒荣、谷士国二同志，长着痔疮还工作。张静波累的手肿起来仍坚持工作。管理上士姬德胜同志看见工人如此紧张，特召集炊事员会议，讨论改善生活。劳动英雄吴占标说：“在家里作自己庄稼活也没这样紧张，亲兄弟也没这样团结友爱，我想这都是为的迅速争取胜利。”
    【又讯】在听到军区被服厂紧张工作消息后，十分区缝衣所全体工人不甘落后，也发动热烈的立功竞赛。并订出半月生产计划：一、缝衣机加快，剪衣组二人每天要剪出二百五十套至三百套衣服，保证不浪费材料。二、单衣缝制要结实，保证不开线等。并一致提出向军区被服所进行挑战。
