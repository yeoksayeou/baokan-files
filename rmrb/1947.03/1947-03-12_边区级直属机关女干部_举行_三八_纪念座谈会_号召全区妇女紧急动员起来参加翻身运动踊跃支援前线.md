　　Women Cadres of the Border Region-Level Directly Subordinate Organs
    Hold "March 8th" Commemorative Symposium
    Calling on All Women in the Region to Immediately Mobilize to Participate in the Emancipation Movement and Actively Support the Front Lines

    [Reported by this newspaper] Women cadres and family members of various directly subordinate organs at the border region level held a commemorative symposium on "March 8th" International Women's Day. Attendees included over 170 people from more than 20 units, including the Border Region Government, Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, Xinhua Bookstore, People's Daily, Jinan Bank, and Yongxing Printing Bureau. Many female comrades attended with their babies, traveling from afar. Responsible comrades from various departments of the Central Bureau personally attended and provided guidance. The congress nominated Comrades Sun Wenshu, Zhu Lian, Zhuo Lin, Lin Yi, and Ding Kun as the presidium. All female comrades spoke enthusiastically. It was generally believed that women had made great contributions in various aspects such as participating in war support and promoting conscription in the past year's Patriotic Self-Defense War. In the land reform movement, the enthusiastic participation of women not only strengthened the ranks of peasant struggles, but also proved through experience that without the mobilization of women, feudal landlords would be difficult to completely eliminate. Therefore, this year's "March 8th" commemoration particularly requires everyone to do more to help rural women emancipate themselves and promote women's participation in the upcoming large-scale production movement. This is an extremely arduous task, and women cadres should unreservedly and resolutely undertake it. Secondly, the symposium also discussed the personal difficulties of women cadres, such as the issue of infants, the training and progress of women cadres, etc. At a time when we are currently tightening our belts to support the front lines, it is impossible for everyone to find a nanny to take care of their children. Therefore, it is generally believed that organizing small nurseries based on equality, mutual assistance, and voluntary association in each organ, where mothers can take turns caring for the children and free up time for work, is a good direction. In addition, even without such nurseries, it is still very necessary and correct for female comrades to take on the responsibility of raising children themselves. This is because it is nurturing revolutionary offspring and can free up husbands to concentrate on fighting or doing other revolutionary work, and should not be taken lightly; those who take good care of their children should be commended. Regarding the training of women cadres, everyone also put forward many valuable opinions. The congress decided that each unit should elect a women's committee to be responsible for leading the research and implementation of the above-mentioned tasks, and to sort out and resolve the issues raised by everyone. Finally, the congress adopted a telegram of condolences to be forwarded to the front-line soldiers by Chief Commanders Liu and Deng, as well as other telegrams, and launched a labor army movement of donating items. Not only should women comrades do it themselves, but they should also promote it among comrades in the organs and the masses in the驻地, and it is hoped that this movement can be universally carried out in organs at all levels throughout the region. The meeting adjourned after a dinner party at 5 p.m.

　　边区级直属机关女干部
    举行“三八”纪念座谈会
    号召全区妇女紧急动员起来参加翻身运动踊跃支援前线
    【本报讯】边区级各直属机关女干部及家属，特于“三八”节举行纪念座谈会，莅会者有边区政府、军区司令部、政治部、新华书店、人民日报、冀南银行、永兴印刷局等二十余单位，共一百七十余人，不少女同志怀抱婴儿，远道赶来。中央局各部负责同志均亲莅会指导；大会推定由孙文淑、朱琏、卓琳、林一、定坤五同志为主席团，所有的女同志都发言，甚为踊跃。咸认为：一年来的爱国自卫战争中，妇女在参加战勤、推动参军等各方面贡献很大；在土地改革运动中，妇女的踊跃参加，不仅壮大了农民斗争的阵营，而且运动中经验证明，没有妇女的发动，封建地主就很难彻底消灭。因此今年纪念“三八”特别需要大家多做帮助农村妇女翻身工作，并推动妇女参加行将到来的大生产运动。这是一件极艰苦的工作，妇女干部应责无旁贷坚决担负起来的。其次还谈到妇女干部的切身困难，如婴儿问题、妇女干部的培养、进步问题等，在目前正在节衣缩食支援前线的时候，不可能每人都找保姆来代为抚养，因此咸认为：以各机关为单位，组织平等互助的自愿结合的小型托儿所，母亲们可轮流变工照顾，腾出时间工作，这是一个很好的方向。此外，没有这样的托儿所，妇女同志自己担任了抚育孩子的工作，也是很必要的，很正确的。因为这是抚育革命后代，并可解放出丈夫专心去打仗或做其他革命工作，不应轻视；照顾孩子好的应予表扬。关于妇女干部的培养问题，大家也提出很多宝贵的意见。大会决定各单位选举一个妇女委员会，负责领导研究执行以上各种工作，并将大家所提出的问题整理解决。最后大会并通过致刘邓首长转前方将士的慰问电及其他通电，并发起开展一件东西的劳军运动，不仅要妇女同志自己做，而且要推动机关同志及驻地群众做，更希望这一运动能在全区各级机关中普遍开展起来。会议至下午五时举行聚餐后始散。
