Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th – Comprehensive reports: Since Chiang Kai-shek announced his “emergency measures” to deal with the economic crisis, facts have increasingly proven in the past ten days that this move cannot save the economic crisis under the rule of the Four Families. The real effect of this move is a cruel means by which the Four Families attack the workers, peasants, and small and medium bourgeoisie to make a fortune from the crisis. This barbaric attack has now aroused resistance from the people.

Chiang Kai-shek dispatched Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) and Central Statistics Bureau (CSB) secret agents and police to search the market (such as in Shanghai). However, except for a temporary decline in a few commodities in a few cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Kunming, and Changsha, most cities and most commodities maintained the peak prices of the 11th and 12th, and the prices of certain cities and certain commodities, such as department stores in Kunming, raw silk and salt in Guangzhou, and grain in Changsha, Shenyang, and Changchun, continued to rise sharply. Grain and all goods in Jinan also rose sharply. Even in Shanghai, department stores have started to rise sharply since the 23rd. “Following closely on the heels of the Chiang government’s new economic measures, Shanghai and various parts of China (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) are again facing a serious situation” (United Press). Wage earners can only receive wages based on the average price level of January, and therefore their actual income has been deprived of at least 40 percent.

The edge of the Chiang government’s “price control” is aimed at farmers, small and medium producers, and merchants. Its content includes “controlling” and “supplying” daily necessities. According to the measures announced by the Chiang government on the 19th, these items include grain, cotton cloth, fuel, salt, sugar, and cooking oil, but the “supply” targets are only civil servants in Nanjing and Shanghai. Workers and staff are only allowed to "purchase on behalf" of the supply according to local prices. Based on the experience during the Anti-Japanese War, the above items will be forcibly purchased at low prices. Once purchased, it will only facilitate the Four Families to hoard and profit. The measures have already stipulated the division of territories by the Four Families. The Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Song family “manages” cotton cloth, fuel, and cooking oil, the Ministry of Food of the Chen family “manages” rice and flour, the Ministry of Finance of the Song family and the Kong family “manages” salt, and Chiang Kai-shek directly “manages” sugar. The above measures will be implemented soon. The second is to implement "official valuation" or "price limits". These measures were announced on the 21st, and the scope of implementation is Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wuhu, Anqing, Guangzhou, Shantou, Guilin, Wuzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kangding, Kunming, Changsha, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping and other 32 cities. Among them, Nanjing and Shanghai are "strictly controlled areas". Some places such as Guizhou and Hubei have announced a ban on grain exports, and Zhejiang and other places have announced that they will implement "official valuation" starting next month. Public opinion in Nanjing and Shanghai generally believes that in the context of increasingly fierce civil war and increasingly uncontrollable currency issuance, the so-called "official valuation" will only benefit officials. The failure of official valuation already has precedents during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, people described the Chiang government's valuation as "raising prices through valuation, valuing prices that are rising, valuing and raising prices, raising and raising prices," that is, "the more you value, the more prices rise." The implementation of so-called grain embargoes by various local authorities will further divide the domestic market and increase economic chaos.

　　利用经济紧急措施残酷搜刮
    四大家族绞杀各阶层
    蒋区物价继续狂涨市场极度混乱
    【新华社延安二十七日电】综合报导：自蒋介石公布其应付经济危机的“紧急措施”后，旬日来事实日益证明，此举并不能挽救四大家族统治下的经济危机，此举之真实作用乃是四大家进攻工农中小资产阶级借以大发危机财的残酷手段，此一野蛮进攻现已激起人民的反抗。
    蒋介石出动了军统中统特务及警宪搜索市场（如上海），但除上海、广州、昆明、长沙等少数城市的少数商品，一时被迫回跌外，大多数城市与大多数商品均维持十一日、十二日最高峰时之价格，而若干城市及若干商品价格如昆明之百货、广州之生丝、盐、长沙、沈阳、长春之粮食等，且继续昂涨，济南之粮食百物亦猛涨不已，即在上海，二十三日起百货亦已开始猛涨。“紧接着蒋政府的经济新措施之后，上海及中国各地（指蒋管区）又已面对严重形势”（合众社）。薪资收入者只能领取一月份平均物价之薪资，因而他们的实际收入已至少被夺取百分之四十。
    蒋政府“管制物价”的刀锋是对着农民及中小生产者及商业家的，其内容一为“掌握”及“供应”日用必须品，据十九日蒋政府公布的办法规定，此项物品包括粮食、纱布、燃料、食盐、食糖及食油，但“供应”对象则仅为南京上海两个城市的公务员，对于工人职工则仅允照当地物价“代购”供给。照抗战时期的经验，上项物品将以低价强迫购取，一旦收购后，则又仅便利于四大家族囤积渔利，该项办法中已规定四大家划分地盘。计宋家的经济部“主管”纱布、燃料、及食油，陈家的粮食部“主管”米及面粉，宋家与孔家的财政部“主管”食盐，蒋介石直接“主管”食糖，上项办法不久将予施行。第二为实行“评价”或“限价”，此项办法已于二十一日公布，实施范围为上海、镇江、无锡、杭州、宁波、芜湖、安庆、广州、汕头、桂林、梧州、福州、厦门、南京、九江、武汉、重庆、成都、康定、昆明、长沙、西安、兰州、太原、开封、郑州、济南、青岛、天津、北平等卅二个城市，其中南京、上海为“严格管制区域”，若干地方如贵州及湖北已宣布禁止粮食出境，浙江等地则宣布将于下月起实施“评价”；京沪舆论均认在内战愈来愈烈，发钞益发不可收拾之中，所谓“评价”，除使官僚得以渔利外，评价之失败已有抗战期中之先例，其时人民描写蒋政府之评价为“评涨、涨评、评涨涨、涨涨评”，即“越评越涨”而各地方当局实行所谓粮食禁运等则将更加割裂国内市场，增加经济混乱。
