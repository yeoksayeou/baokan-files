　　Guaranteeing the Property Rights of Liberated Peasants
    HeShun County Government Issues Provisional Measures
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 3rd] Following the completion of land reform in HeShun, in order to reassure all strata of society and allow them to focus on production, the county government has issued a public notice promulgating the "Provisional Measures for Protecting the Lives and Property of the Laboring People," passed by the County Council. 1. All land, houses, and all property obtained by liberated peasants during the liquidation movement are private property and are protected by law. No one may infringe upon them. 2. Those of all strata who become wealthy through labor and production will be protected by the government according to law. No one may infringe upon them. The government reiterates that property accumulated through labor and production that does not belong to rental exploitation, corruption, or local bullies, such as the property of middle peasants, must not be altered under any pretext. Those who were wrongly accused during the liquidation movement will be immediately compensated or have their property returned. 3. The people have the right to freely dispose of their private property. In the future, those who become impoverished due to increased population and insufficient land, or due to wasting the fruits of their labor and failing to engage in production, will no longer be subsidized. 4. From now on, crimes committed by the laboring people will be handled by the government's judicial organs. Villages must not arbitrarily punish them. Violators will be punished according to law. 5. Landlords who submit to government laws after the liquidation and turn to labor and production to accumulate wealth will also have their property protected by the government, and their personal safety will be guaranteed. Those who do not consciously change, organize special agents, spread rumors, engage in sabotage, or plot to reverse the verdicts will be resolutely suppressed.
