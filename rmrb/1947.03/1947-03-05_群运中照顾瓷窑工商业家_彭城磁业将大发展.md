Caring for Porcelain Kiln Industrialists and Businessmen in the Mass Movement
	Pengcheng Porcelain Industry to Greatly Develop

[This newspaper's Cixian report] In Pengcheng, a famous porcelain producing area, the masses, during the land reform movement, thoroughly settled accounts with feudal landlords, and appropriately took care of porcelain kiln industrialists and businessmen, enabling the town's porcelain kilns to achieve new development and prosperity. Due to the offensive of Chiang's army, porcelain sales were affected. To take care of the kiln owners' operating difficulties and develop national industry, porcelain kiln workers voluntarily reduced their wages by 30% and cancelled all miscellaneous wages, to achieve labor-capital cooperation and development of production. After joint meetings and consultations between workers and capitalists, labor-capital production contracts and production plans were drawn up. Worker representatives sincerely expressed: For the sake of the development of the porcelain industry, we are willing to give up all miscellaneous wage demands, reduce wages, and ensure increased production, care for tools, and save raw materials. The porcelain kiln owners were very moved, accepted the workers' opinions, actively purchased carts to set up porcelain stations, solved transportation and sales difficulties, saved unnecessary staff expenses, reduced bowl shops, and opened more porcelain transshipment stations to circulate funds and expand production. Porcelain capitalist Zhang Shucai reviewed that he did not manage the porcelain kiln well last year, and this year he will formulate a business plan, sell off inventory, and expand production. After the labor and capital sides signed the production contract, they are cooperating to solve the difficulties of porcelain supply and sales. The democratic government is also vigorously helping to solve the raw material supply. This long-standing national industry will be smoothly developed under the joint management of labor and capital.

　　群运中照顾瓷窑工商业家
    彭城磁业将大发展
    【本报磁县讯】著名瓷业区彭城群众，在土地改革运动中，对封建地主进行彻底清算，对瓷窑工商业家适当照顾，使该镇瓷窑得到新的发展和繁荣。由于蒋军的进攻，曾使瓷器销路受到影响。瓷窑工人为了照顾窑主经营困难，发展民族工业，自动减低工资三成，取消一切杂项工资，以达劳资合作，发展生产目的。经过工人与资方共同开会协商，订立了劳资生产合同和生产计划。工人代表赤诚表示：为了瓷业的发展，我们自愿的放弃一切杂项工资要求，降低工资，并保证提高生产，爱护工具，节省原料。瓷窑主很受感动，接受工人意见，积极购买大车设立瓷站，解决运销困难，节省不必要职员开支，减少碗铺，多开瓷器转运栈，以周转资金扩大生产。瓷窑资本家张树材检讨去年没很好经理瓷窑，今年要制订经营计划，变卖存货，扩大生产。劳资双方于订立生产合同后，正协力解决瓷器供销困难。民主政府在原料供给方面，亦大力帮助解决。此一历史悠久之民族工业，在劳资协力经营下将得到顺利发展。
