    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: United Press reports that French Communist Party members of the National Assembly abstained from voting on the government's policy towards Vietnam on the 19th. After an all-night debate, the policy passed by a vote of 421 to zero. The content is unknown. The Communists' abstention was due to the Ramadier government's refusal to meet the party's demand to negotiate with Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh. It is also reported that Monnerville of the Left Republican Rally has been elected Speaker of the Republican Senate, after the previous Speaker, Li Bei, passed away recently.

    法国会通过对越南政策
    共产党议员弃权
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】合众社报导，法国共产党国会议员于十九日表决政府对越南政策时弃权。该政策在彻夜争辩之后，以四百二十一票对零票通过。内容不悉。共产党人之弃权，系由于拉马弟政府拒绝该党之要求与越南领袖胡志明进行谈判。又悉：左翼共和同盟之蒙沃维勒已被选为共和参议院议长，前议长李贝于不久之前逝世。
