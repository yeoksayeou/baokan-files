Serving the Cultural Needs of the Masses
　　Lucheng Cultural Cooperative Makes Contributions
　　[Report from this newspaper in Lucheng] The Lucheng Cultural Cooperative organized the masses to produce goods in exchange for stationery and textbooks, resolving the problem of purchasing difficulties. It also actively combined propaganda and education with mass production and entertainment. Over the years, it has achieved great results, and the Taihang Administrative Office has issued a commendation. The cooperative was established in January of last year. Over the past year, with their active and proactive efforts and the concern and specific assistance from county leaders, they have achieved remarkable results. They initially received only 25,000 yuan in funds from the Education Section's textbook distribution station. However, they also mobilized people in the cultural field to invest and absorbed funds from the masses, and now the total share capital has increased to 2,018,225 yuan. In terms of distribution, they tried every means to deliver the goods directly to the readers. During the busy farming season, each of the two branches sent a salesperson to the countryside to carry stationery and textbooks to the schools. In order to solve the purchasing difficulties of the masses, they also mobilized the masses to accumulate hemp fiber and weave straw hats in exchange for goods, which not only increased mass production but also solved the raw material problems for their own paper mill and straw hat workshop. Over the past year, they have produced 34,500 reams of paper and printed 52,200 textbooks, enabling Lucheng to be the first to find a satisfactory solution to the textbook problem that had not been resolved in the Taihang District for several years. They also actively participated in social activities, adapted to the needs of the masses, and printed various picture posters and scripts that met the needs of the masses. During the Lantern Festival, they used their vacation time to collectively create riddles and ballads in conjunction with the army support meeting, organized a literary and art troupe, and mobilized the masses to guess lantern riddles at night, with crowds of over 400 people every night. This new type of cultural cooperative is a new creation on our cultural and educational front. In addition to issuing a commendation and awarding 10,000 yuan to encourage them to make even greater contributions, the Taihang Administrative Office is calling on cultural cooperatives in various places to learn from their spirit of humbly studying and improving creation to serve the people, and to launch a movement for cultural cooperatives to make contributions to the people.

　　为群众文化事业服务
    潞城文化合作社立功
    【本报潞城讯】潞城文化合作社，组织群众生产换文具课本解决购买困难问题，并积极结合群众生产娱乐开展宣传教育，年来成绩很大，太行行署特通报表扬。该社成立于去年一月份，一年来在他们积极主动努力和县领导上的关心与具体帮助下，成绩显著。他们原仅接受教育科课本发行栈资金二万五千元；但他们又发动文化界入股，吸收群众资金，现股金已增至二百零一万八千二百廿五元。发行上，他们想尽办法直接送到读者手里。农忙时，两个分社各派一个营业员挑担子下乡把文具课本送到学校。为解决群众购买困难，又发动群众积麻头，编草帽，以货交换，既增加了群众生产，又解决了自己纸厂、草帽庄的原料问题。一年来共造纸三万四千五百区，印出课本五万二千二百本，使太行区几年未解决的课本问题，首先在潞城求得圆满解决。他们并积极参加社会活动，适应群众要求，印出各种适应群众需要的画报剧本等。元宵节他们利用休假集体创作谜语小调结合拥军大会，组织文艺乐团，在夜间发动群众打灯谜，观众拥挤每夜达四百余人。这种新型的文化合作社，是我们文教战线上的新创造，太行行署除通报表扬奖予一万元鼓励其功上加功外；并号召各地文化合作社学习他们虚心研究，改进创作的为人民服务精神，开展文化合作社为人民立功运动。（常江河）
