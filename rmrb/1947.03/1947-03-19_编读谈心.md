　　Editor-Reader Communication
    "Thoughts and Experiences" meets you today in a special page format, but it is actually just a column. In the future, as long as we have one or two manuscripts in this area, we will open a column to publish them, hoping that readers will help us write the following types of manuscripts:
    I. The understanding of Mao Zedong Thought gained from one's own work experience.
    II. Insights or reflections from studying the Party Constitution.
    III. Specialized and systematic understanding and elaboration of Mao Zedong Thought.
    IV. Any knots in your mind that cannot be untied can be put forward as "thought exchange" for everyone to discuss.

　　编读谈心
    《思想和体验》今天以专页的样式和大家见面，但其实只是一个栏。以后只要有那么一两篇这方面的稿子，我们就辟栏刊出，希望读者帮我们写下列各类稿子：
    一、从本身工作经验中体会到的毛主席思想。
    二、党章学习中的心得或反省。
    三、对毛主席思想的专门的系统的了解和阐述。
    四、思想中解不开的任何圪瘩，可作“思想交流”提出，大家讨论。
