    Notice to all parents:
    Our institution has been established for over a year, and thanks to the enthusiastic help from all sectors, we have laid a foundation and appropriately improved the lives of the children. However, due to our lack of experience and the impact of the war, many shortcomings still exist. The 4/4 Children's Day is approaching, and our institution has prepared light refreshments for a social gathering. We sincerely request your presence at that time, and we hope you will provide suggestions for future work so that we can improve.
        Welfare Nursery
        Address: Donglutou Village, Eighth District, She County
