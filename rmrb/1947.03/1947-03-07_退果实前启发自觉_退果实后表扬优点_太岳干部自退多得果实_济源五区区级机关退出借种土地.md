Taiyue, March 5th - In the later stages of land reform and during the re-examination process in various regions, many cadres continue to be discovered who have obtained undue gains through "cheap purchases," "gifts," or "excessive distribution." For example, the chairman of the farmers' association in Dong'an Village, Fifth District of Yangcheng, used three names to obtain an excessive share of the fruits. The leadership used individual talks, praised achievements, and pointed out shortcomings to get through their thinking and let them voluntarily return the gains. The Fifth District of Yangcheng specially convened these cadres, using "heart-to-heart talks" and "praising achievements" to reflect on and correct their mistakes. Initially, Liang Gui, a village cadre, believed that the extra gains were obtained through the masses and not taken privately, and he was unwilling to admit his mistake. However, a cadre from Quling Village said, "We know our problems. You don't need to say more. Although it was passed by everyone, it was still because our cadres wanted good things and were embarrassed to say it, and everyone had unspoken thoughts, so they all helped each other. You let the masses pass it for me, and I will let it pass for you." This revealed everyone's thoughts, and everyone laughed. Xigui also admitted his mistake. After talks and enlightenment, the village chief of Shuangjing Village in Gaoping, Han Chunmao, the chairman of the farmers' association, Han Duoshun, and two others admitted their mistakes in front of the masses, returning 29 mu of land, 7 houses, and 36 silver dollars. This movement was also carried out among district cadres. Qu Fuhe, a cadre in Qinshui District, voluntarily returned a house and 21,000 silver dollars. The Fifth District of Jiyuan went a step further and handed over all the land cultivated by district-level organs, some of which were nominally borrowed, except for a portion cultivated by the cadres' family members, and distributed it to the masses. It was also stipulated that those who had previously mobilized the masses to cultivate the land should return 70% of the harvest to the masses. This exemplary action greatly promoted the return of extra gains by village cadres. Zhao Yuying, director of the Women's Rescue Association in Zhangjin, voluntarily returned the relief grain allocated by the district to the masses because of her previous excessive distribution of fruits.

In addition, many places have carried out necessary follow-up work after the cadres returned the fruits, comforting and praising the cadres. On this basis, a meritorious service campaign was launched. Han Chunmao and Han Maishun, the village chiefs of Shuangjing Village in Gaoping, vowed after returning the fruits: "We will definitely do good things for everyone and make contributions to the people in the future." Qu Fuhe, a cadre in Qinshui District, vowed: "I will transform myself well and make more contributions."

Jinan, Hebei, March 5th - Longping convened a meeting of cadres from various districts to discuss and formulate methods for dealing with the problem of leftover fruits: (1) All leftover land, real estate, and materials in the villages should be distributed to the masses. (2) Houses and land that have not been measured and contracted should be measured and contracted as soon as possible. (3) All fruits embezzled by village cadres and fruits purchased at low prices should be returned to the masses. Village cadres should automatically hand over the property and materials borrowed from landlords to the farmers' association, and village cadres should return the extra fruits that they have been allocated. (4) The gold and silver dollars extracted by the masses should be sold to the bank under the supervision of the village cadres to prevent them from flowing into the Jiang area. (5) All fruits purchased at low prices by county and district cadres should be returned to the masses, and the responsible cadres should lead the apology to the masses.

　　退果实前启发自觉  退果实后表扬优点
    太岳干部自退多得果实
    济源五区区级机关退出借种土地
    【本报太岳五日电】各地填补末期与复查中，继续发现了不少干部以“贱买”、“赠送”、“多分”等方式得到不应得的果实。如阳城五区东安村农会主席，曾一人顶三个名字，多分果实。领导上用个别谈话，表扬功劳，指出缺点等方式，打通思想，让其自觉退出。阳城五区特别召集这些干部，用“谈心事”“表功劳”反省与纠正自己错误。开始时，某村干部梁贵还对多得果实认为是通过群众的，不是私自拿的，不肯承认错误。但经璩岭村的一个干部说：“咱们的毛病咱知道，你不用再说，虽说通过大家，但还不是咱们干部见了好东西心想要，话不好说出口，大家都有心事，所以就都互相给转圈圈，你给我让群众通过，我给你让通过。”这一下说募大家的心思，哄的都笑了，喜贵也承认了错误。高平双井村干部经过谈话启发后，村长韩春茂，农会主席韩多顺等四人当下在群众面前承认错误，退出多得地二十九亩，房子七间，银洋三十六元。这一运动在区干部中也开展起来。沁水区干部璩福合自动退出房子和大洋二万一千元。济源五区更深入一步把区一级机关所种的土地，有些名义上还是借种的，除干部家属亲自劳动耕种一部分外，其余全部交出，分给群众。并规定已往动员群众劳动耕种者，以收获百分之七十退给群众。此种模范行动，大大推动了村干部退出多得果实，张金妇救会主任赵玉英因已往多分果实，这次自动将区上拨给的救济粮食退给群众。
    此外不少地方在干部退出果实后，进行了必须的善后工作，安慰干部，表扬干部。并在这一基础上开展立功运动。高平双井村长韩春茂、韩麦顺在退出果实后宣誓：“今后一定为大家办好事，为民立功”。沁水区干部璩福合立誓：“好好改造自己，多立功劳。”
    【本报冀南五日电】隆平召开各区干部会议，对遗留果实问题讨论出处理办法：（一）各村遗留的土地、房产、物款全部分给群众。（二）未丈量立契的房和地从速丈量立契。（三）村干贪污的果实和贱买的果实全部退还群众。村干暗借地主的财产物款应自动交农会，村干多分果实应退出。（四）群众斗出金子、银元。村干部负责督促卖给银行，以免流入蒋区。（五）县区干部贱买的果实全部退回群众，并由负责干部领导向群众道歉。
