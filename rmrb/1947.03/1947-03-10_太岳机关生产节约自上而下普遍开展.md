Taiyue, March 8th (reported by this newspaper) – The Taiyue organs have launched a production and savings campaign from top to bottom and from bottom to top. Director Niu of the Administrative Office personally formulated a production and savings plan. In addition to cooperating with individuals to grow vegetables and raise pigs, he only requires one set of single-layer clothing in terms of savings, and all other clothing to be received is saved. The Construction Department uses individual savings on single-layer clothing to pool shares for raising pigs and spinning and weaving, and has organized a transportation team to transport coal, earning a profit of 4,200 yuan. Technical personnel from various departments have promoted their expertise, with some making spinning wheels, some rolling cigarettes, some making soap, and some making fermented bean curd and bean paste. The living standards of the organs have gradually decreased. In January, 2.81 shi (石, unit of dry measure) of grain, 2,420 jin (斤, unit of weight) of coal, and 16,269 yuan in office expenses were saved. In addition to lowering living standards, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily and the Taiyue Branch of the Xinhua News Agency have begun printing and binding. Another part is buying spinning flowers and foreign socks, planning to produce at least 10,000 yuan per person this year. Cadres and odd-job workers from the Fourth Prefectural Commissioner's Office jointly formed a transportation team, transporting crucible clay (clay for firing bowls) from the mountains to the porcelain kilns every evening after dinner. From the 22nd to the 28th of last month, they received 1.4 shi of millet in seven days. The Jincheng County Government proposed "Organs are also factories" and launched a handicraft production campaign. The Judicial Section purchased weaving machines, spun their own flowers, and knitted their own socks. After work each day, the whirring of spinning and weaving can be heard. Each traffic officer has a spinning wheel for spinning thread and knitting hats. The cooks mine coke for sale to various organs, and also collectively reclaim wasteland for growing vegetables, ensuring self-sufficiency in vegetables. The Gaoping County Government and Public Security Bureau attach equal importance to agricultural and sideline production, renting land for growing vegetables, spinning flowers, and knitting sweaters, expecting to achieve self-sufficiency in all expenses except grain and clothing throughout the year.
