　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 8th: The U.S. economic aid plan to the Greek royalist government has been criticized by democratic groups in the United States. Nakis, secretary of the American League for Democratic Action Committee, told reporters that he had written to Secretary of State Marshall and the House Foreign Affairs Committee opposing the move. He said that American taxpayers will not support loans to Greek reactionaries to destroy Greek democracy. The National Committee of the Macedonian American League stated in a letter to Marshall: "We strongly protest and urge you to abandon any plan to interfere in Greece's internal affairs by maintaining the corrupt King of Athens and the barbaric rule of neo-fascist soldiers."
