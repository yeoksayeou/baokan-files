    Boldly Advance Behind Enemy Lines to Fight Back Home
    Anyang Militia Recover Vast Villages
    Merit Campaign Creates Mass Upsurge
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Taihang Branch News Agency reporter Shi Hong reports: After five months of arduous struggle, the Anyang military and civilians have comprehensively shifted from a passive to an active position. As of now, they have forced more than 90% of the villages' special agents and landlords to stop their "retaliatory reckoning," and the scope of our government's orders has expanded threefold compared to before (from 33 villages to over 100). North of Shuizha, work has penetrated east of the Shuiguan Highway; south of Shuizha, the vast villages of the Seventh District have returned to the embrace of the motherland; west of the Huan River, the enemy has disappeared. Currently, our staff can freely enter and exit any enemy-occupied village, even Shuizha. The fundamental reason for this is the development of a conscious and voluntary mass-based merit campaign.
    After the enemy occupied Shuizha in October of last year, by mid-November, the Anyang leadership issued a call for merit-making throughout the county. At that time, the enemy was frantically attacking us, and the masses in the enemy-occupied areas were urgently crying for help. The militiamen who had been transferred out all requested to return to their villages to see what was happening. However, because the enemy's paper tiger nature had not been exposed, no one was willing to go down first. At this time, the Fifth and Third Regiments burned down the stone coffin blockhouse on the Shuiguan Highway. The leadership seized on this fact to vigorously publicize it and called on everyone to learn from them and advance behind enemy lines. The slogan was very simple: "Whoever dares to go back to the village to take a look is a good cadre and a good militiaman!" Then, each district selected brave cadres and militiamen and found safe routes for them in advance, escorting them in with armed force. On the same day, the morale of the cadres and militiamen who returned from Tianchi changed. They said, "The enemy is really a paper tiger; the further back you go, the looser they are." The small newspaper "People's Voice" immediately published their situation in Tianchi in large characters to show their merit. When the militiamen saw this, they felt there was no danger, so they also went back to take a look, and entering and exiting enemy areas became commonplace. At this time, some people felt that it was meaningless to just look outside the village; it would be better to go into the village. However, they were afraid of the enemy, so they fired shots at the village entrance to test the situation. If there was no reaction, they would run back to report. On the one hand, the leadership praised this action as reconnaissance by fire and greatly commended it; on the other hand, they suggested that it would be even better to enter the village to find out the situation. At this time, everyone's fear of fighting the enemy had gradually disappeared, and some went to the village to listen for news, while others knocked on the doors of acquaintances to ask about the situation. The leadership, on the one hand, praised everyone who entered the village, and at the same time, gave special praise to those who understood the situation best, greatly increasing everyone's morale.
    After understanding the situation, County Magistrate Ma, County Party Secretary Comrade He, and Director Xu led a large army in twelve routes to advance behind enemy lines on November 21st, catching the enemy's "homecoming legions" completely off guard. The militiamen personally witnessed the enemy fleeing in disarray, and their morale changed unprecedentedly. They all competed to fight and make meritorious contributions. Since then, every day there have been one or two dozen large and small armed forces entering enemy territory, and every night there were gunshots and fires everywhere.
    As of November 27th, both sides of the Shuiguan Highway had become places frequently entered and exited by the Anyang military and civilians. However, the militiamen of Shuizha still felt that entering Shuizha was a difficult task and were afraid to move forward. The masses and the leadership all believed that "it is a disgrace for the people of Shuizha not to dare to enter Shuizha." The Shuizha militiamen were unwilling to fall behind and, after a full discussion, were determined to make meritorious achievements in entering Shuizha. Their first step in the merit-making plan was to enter the North Gate to capture the big special agent landlord Yang Chunfang.
    On the night of the 28th, Deputy Squad Leader Lü Bingquan's group (a total of three people) crossed the Shuiguan Highway, lined with bunkers, for the first time, took off their clothes, waded across the rapid Zhushui River, pasted announcements and leaflets on the main street of the North Gate of Shuizha, climbed into Yang Chunfang's courtyard wall, and tied Yang Chunfang back to the base area. The county headquarters immediately issued an order to commend them, saying that they were intelligent, brave, and unafraid of difficulties, and resolutely completed their mission. In addition to awarding each person a first-class bonus of thirty kilograms of millet, their experience was circulated throughout the county for everyone to learn from. Hou Quan's group was not convinced and also entered the West Gate on December 1st, captured the mother of a special agent captain, and held a small mass meeting. After the small newspaper published this matter, Wang Jinxiao and Zhang Deyi went down the next day during the day. That afternoon, they captured a reactionary landlord in the South Gate. Ji Guangli's group was even more unconvinced, and four or five people took advantage of the enemy's outing to plunder, when the edge of the Shuizha stockade was being built and ditches were being dug, and entered the West Gate, shooting down a sentry head-on. The enemy digging ditches quickly climbed the stockade wall and fired guns and cannons, but Ji Guangli and the others did not panic and were very excited, saying, "We knocked someone down and wasted his ammunition; this deal is still cheap." Saying that, they turned to the South Gate, distributed announcements and leaflets on the street, and then returned safely. Since then, no one has felt that entering Shuizha is a difficult task. The enemy was very terrified, and they all withdrew their troops back to the city before sunset, closed the stockade gates tightly, and imposed a curfew as soon as the lights were turned on, forcing the masses to light street lights in every house to prevent our attacks.
    Because of high morale, a large number of combat heroes and banners, such as the Duan Fazhang Militia Guerrilla Team, the Ren Wenliang Militia Team, and the Xiabao Militia, emerged, becoming recognized models and playing a huge role in promoting the struggle throughout the county. From November to December, in 25 days, the militia alone fought 452 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 192 enemies and recovering 49 villages and towns.
    Their leadership experience is: start with the easiest tasks (such as going to an enemy-occupied village to take a look), and praise every little bit of merit, no matter how small. At the same time, pay attention to seizing the opportunity, put forward new slogans, and gradually raise the movement.

### 大胆挺进敌后打回家乡  安阳民兵恢复广大村庄  立功运动造成群众性热潮

    大胆挺进敌后打回家乡
    安阳民兵恢复广大村庄
    立功运动造成群众性热潮
    【本报特讯】太行分社记者史洪报导：安阳军民经过五个月苦斗，已全面由被动转为主动；截至目前，已迫使百分之九十以上村庄的特务地主停止了“倒算”，我政令通行范围较前扩大三倍（原三十三个村，现一百挂零）。水冶以北，工作已深入到水观公路东面；水冶以南，七区广大村庄重归祖国怀抱；洹河以西，敌人绝迹。现我工作人员已可随意进出于任何一个敌占村庄，以至水冶。其基本原因，乃是一个自觉自愿的群众性的立功运动的开展。
    去年十月敌侵占水冶后，至十一月中旬，安阳领导上即向全县发出立功号召，当时敌人正向我疯狂进攻，敌占区群众急呼救命，转移出来的民兵，都要求回村看看；但由于敌人纸老虎未打破，谁也不肯先下去。这时恰逢五三部队焚毁水观公路上的石棺炮楼，领导上即抓住这一事实，大力宣传，号召大家向他们学习，挺进敌后。口号提的很低：“谁敢回村看看，就是好干部、好民兵！”接着各区选择了胆大的干部和民兵，并预先给找好没危险的路，以武装护送他们进去。当天由天池回来的干部民兵情绪首先变了，他们说：“敌人真是个纸老虎，越到后面越松。”《人民呼声》小报立即将他们到天池去的情况，大字登了出来，以表其功。民兵们一看，觉得没危险，就你也回去瞧瞧，他也回去看看，进出敌区成了常事。这时有人感到光在村外看没意思，不如到村里去，可是又怕有敌人，于是在村口打枪试探，没有反响，就跑回来报告。领导上一方面把这种行动誉为火力侦察，大大表扬；另方面，提出更好的是进村去探出情况来。这时大家对敌斗争的恐怖已逐渐消除，有的便到村里听动静，有的更敲开熟人的门问情况。领导上一方面表扬所有进村的人，同时对了解情况最好的作了特别表扬，大家情绪大大提高。
    了解情况后，马县长、县委书记何同志及徐主任即于十一月二十一日率领大军十二路挺进敌后，把敌“还乡团”搞了个措手不及一团糟，民兵们亲眼见到敌人狼狈逃窜，情绪起了空前变化，都争着打仗立功了。自此，每天都有一二十股大小武装进入敌后，每夜都是遍地枪声火光。
    截至十一月二十七日，水观公路两旁，均已成为安阳军民经常出入之地。但水冶的民兵却仍觉得进水冶是件很困难的事，畏惧不前。群众与领导上都认为“水冶人不敢进水冶是件耻辱”，水冶民兵不甘落后，经全体讨论，下决心要在进水冶上立功；他们第一步立功计划是进北关捕捉大特务地主杨春芳。
    二十八日夜，大队副吕炳全小组（共三人），第一次穿过碉堡林立的水观公路，脱光衣服，涉过急流的珠水，把布告传单贴到水冶北关大街上，爬进杨春芳的院墙，把杨春芳捆回根据地来。县指挥部立即传令嘉奖，说他们智勇双全，不怕艰险，完成任务坚决，除授予每人头等奖金三十斤小米外，并把他的经验通报全县，让大家学习。侯全的小组不服气，十二月一日也进入西关，捉回一个特务队长的母亲，还召开了一个小型群众会。小报把这事一发表，王进校、张德义二人第二天白天就下去了；当日下午就在南关捉回来一个反动地主。姬光礼小组更不服气，四五个人便乘着敌人外出抢掠，水冶寨边正在筑寨挖沟之时，进入西关劈头射倒一个哨兵，挖沟的敌人连忙登上寨墙，大打枪炮，但姬光礼他们没有慌，却很兴奋的说，“打倒了人，又耗费了他的弹药，这买卖倒也便宜。”说着就转到了南关，把布告传单散在大街，然后安然回返。从此，再也没有人感到进水冶是件难事了。敌人非常恐怖，太阳不落就都收兵回城，把寨门闭紧；至点灯即行禁街，并强迫群众家家点路灯，防我袭击。
    由于斗志昂扬，大批战斗英雄与旗帜如段法章民兵武工队、任文亮民兵队、下堡民兵等涌现出来，成为大家公认的模范，在推动全县斗争上都起了巨大作用。十一月到十二月二十五天中，仅民兵单独作战即达四百五十二次，毙伤俘敌一百九十二名，收复村镇四十九个。
    他们的领导经验是：从最容易处着手（如进敌占村看看），不论大小功劳，一星一点都要表扬。同时注意抓紧火候，提出新口号，一步步把运动提高。
