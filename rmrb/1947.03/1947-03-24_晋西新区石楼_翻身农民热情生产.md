    Shi Lou, New District of Western Shanxi
    Emancipated Peasants Enthusiastically Engage in Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 20th] Shi Lou County, a newly liberated area in western Shanxi, has taken on a new look after land reform. Before liberation, in Chengguan Village, many of the more than 300 households suffered from famine and fled. After the land reform, 258 poor farmers in the village obtained 2,226 mu of land. When distributing the fruits of labor, the masses' organization committee, after four democratic discussions, announced that each person would receive an average of 6 mu of land. In addition, 819 yuan in silver was used to buy cattle for poor farmers and to solve the food and farming tools problems for 122 extremely poor families. The land and two oxen of middle peasant Liang Chengcang had been "merged" by Yan Xishan, forcing him to flee, and his children were emaciated from hunger. Now, he has been allocated enough land and bought a large castrated ox, and plans to cultivate 100 mu of land this year. Poor peasant Guo Bulai was allocated 10 mu of land and bought an ox, and plans to reclaim another 10 mu of wasteland. Ninety poor urban residents, including workers, shop assistants, and impoverished citizens, were allocated more than 200 rooms, and 62 small vendors have resumed business. Carpenter Chen Guizi was allocated three rooms. He said excitedly, "In the past, I only built houses for others, and I didn't have my own house. Now I am a master."

    晋西新区石楼
    翻身农民热情生产
    【新华社晋绥廿日电】晋西新解放区石楼县，经土地改革后，气象一新。城关村三百余户解放前，许多户饥馑逃亡，土地改革后，全村有二百五十八个贫苦农民得到土地二千二百二十六亩。分配果实时，由群众组织委员会，经四次民主讨论后公布，每人平均获地六亩，并以清算出之白洋八百一十九元，给贫苦农民买牛和给一百二十二家赤贫解决口粮和农具问题。中农梁成仓的土地和两犋牛以前全被阎锡山“合”掉，被迫逃亡，孩子饿得面黄肌瘦；现在分得足够土地，又买了一头大犍牛，今年计划种地百亩。贫农郭补来分得土地合十亩，买牛一头，准备再开荒坟地十亩。城关工人小店员贫苦市民九十人共分得房二百余间，六十二家小商贩已恢复营业。木匠陈贵子分到三间房，他兴奋地说：“我过去只是给人家造房子，自家没住的，现在算做了主人。”
