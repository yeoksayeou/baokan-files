    【This Dispatch from Jinnan on the 14th】Farmers in Xinbei Village, Shen County, have cleared out over 130 mu of land from the landlords, but have not been able to determine the boundaries nor obtain the land deeds for a long time. The masses said, "The handle of the knife is still in the hands of the landlords." During the recent land reform review, village cadres went to the landlords to ask for the deeds. Only Zhao Xilin's family handed them over, while the other six households refused on various pretexts. After a meeting of the Farmers' Association, everyone unanimously said: "We must resolutely demand them; they must give them up!" It was decided to first form a team to demand the documents from Zhao Hesong, who had served as a section chief in the puppet Han government. They were victorious in retrieving the deeds. They are now making a concentrated effort to measure the land. There are two land-measuring experts in the village who formed two groups and completed the measurement of 130 mu of land in the whole village in three days, and established new contracts. After the contracts were established, the farmers began planning to deliver manure and cultivate the land. Some said they would plant millet on their plot, while others said they would plant sorghum. Production enthusiasm is extremely high.

　　莘北丈地立契农民热情生产
    【本报冀南十四日电】莘县莘北村农民从地主手内清算出土地一百三十余亩，但长期未认地边，文契也未要出来，群众说：“刀把还在地主手内。”最近翻身大检查中，村干去向地主要文契，只有地主赵希林一家拿出来，其他六户都推故不给。经过农会员大会，大家一致说：“坚决要，不给不行！”便决定首先结队去向当过汉奸政府科长的赵合松索回文书，追契胜利；他们正突击丈量土地，这村有两个会算地的先生，组成两个小组，全村一顷三十亩地三天便丈量完了，并立好新契。立契完竣，农民们纷纷计划送粪耕地，有的说我那块地种谷子，有的说我那块地种高粱。生产情绪极高。
