    Licheng Cooperative Promotes Two-Wheel Spinning Wheels
    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] To solve the shortage of thread, the Licheng Third and Fourth District Joint Cooperatives are vigorously promoting two-wheel spinning wheels. The cooperative's staff specially arranged a textile exhibition at the Dongyangguan Temple Fair on February 15th (lunar calendar), setting up promoters to explain to the masses that Zheng Hufeng used the factory's newly made double-wheel spinning wheel and could spin one catty and two liang of thread a day. Visitors were all determined to go back and switch to using large spinning wheels. Under the leadership of the cadres of Zizhen Village in the Third District, workers manufactured 68 large spinning wheels and改造 twelve old spinning wheels, and made six new hand-cranked machines in twenty days. In addition, to solve the difficulty for weaving women in selling finished products, the cooperative has established a native cloth sales office, setting up a store to purchase everything in bulk, and distributing goods according to shares. In addition to the county's joint cooperative and commercial cooperative having invested 1.17 million yuan, the cooperative is continuing to develop this in large quantities.
