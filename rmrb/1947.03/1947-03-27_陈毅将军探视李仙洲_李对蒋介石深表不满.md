Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 25th – General Chen Yi, Commander of the East China Liberation Army, personally visited Li Xianzhou's residence at 9:00 am on the 15th of this month to inquire about the condition of Li's wounds. He expressed deep concern, for which Li was extremely grateful and ashamed. When discussing the Laiwu Campaign, Li said, "The main reason for this failure was the erroneous strategic guidance of the Ministry of National Defense. Also, Mr. Wang Yaowu (note: Commander of the First Appeasement Zone of Chiang's Xuzhou Appeasement Headquarters) interfered too much with his subordinates and should also be held responsible. Mr. Wang directly sent telegrams to the various armies, divisions, and even regiments. Even though I was at the front, I was sometimes unaware of what was happening." When General Chen Yi told him that Chiang's Ministry of National Defense claimed that the failure was due to Li's improper command, Li gave a bitter smile and said indignantly, "Serving as a deputy in the Kuomintang army is like being an appendage. Unless you also hold the position of Director of the Political Department or have connections to higher levels, like me being a deputy commander, there's nothing you can do. When I was at the Jinan headquarters, I only greeted ordinary guests for Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang and I often didn't see each other for days. This time when I came to the front, I was just a high-level messenger. For example, when Chen Cheng came to Jinan to discuss confidential matters with Mr. Wang, I was not allowed to participate. I think fighting Japanese devils during the eight-year War of Resistance was right. Now fighting a civil war is wrong. I wanted to retire long ago, but I was afraid of causing Mr. Wang's misunderstanding and suspicion. I despise his ability to climb the ladder through connections, even though he lacks the qualifications; I don't want to be his subordinate." At this point, Li sighed in despair and said, "I feel that Mr. Chiang uses people based on personal preference." General Chen Yi then said, "According to this, Mr. Li has always been dissatisfied with Mr. Chiang." Although Li had only met General Chen Yi for the first time, they talked very happily, and Li particularly regretted not having met him sooner. The conversation lasted two hours, and General Chen Yi took his leave, saying that Li should not be too tired after his injury. General Chen Yi then summoned the senior officers of the Chiang army's 73rd Army and the Reorganized 43rd Division who had been captured along with Li Xianzhou, including Li Chen, the Major General Deputy Commander of the 73rd Army, and eight others. He explained to them the current situation and military situation and encouraged them to inspect and study democratic facilities and Chinese political issues so that they could contribute to the people after the realization of peace. Before leaving, General Chen Yi also instructed them to convey his concern to Major General Xiao Shiguang, commander of the 193rd Division, who was unable to attend due to his injuries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd – Yu Zhensheng, the pilot of Chiang's P-57 aircraft shot down over Hezhuang, northeast of Laiwu, during the Laiwu annihilation battle last month, was a Second Lieutenant pilot of the 28th Squadron of the Third Brigade of Chiang's Air Force. After being captured and having his wounds treated, he arrived at the "East China Chiang Army Liberation Officer Corps" in the liberated area a few days ago. Yu described his experience of being shot down, saying: On the morning of the 21st of last month, the 77th Division of Chiang's 73rd Army was annihilated in Hezhuang. Wang Yaowu in Jinan was very panicked when the radio lost contact and immediately drove his air force to reconnaissance. At 10:40, two planes took off from Jinan at the same time. The one Yu was flying was the P-57, number 369. When flying over Hezhuang, he saw a large number of Chiang soldiers in gray uniforms, who had laid down their weapons, being escorted south by People's Liberation Army soldiers in yellow uniforms. The two Chiang planes then made a low-altitude strafing run. Yu's plane was forced to land after being hit in the lubricant oil tank. Yu was scratched on the head and legs when he parachuted to the ground. He was captured by the militia of the liberated area and immediately treated. He has now recovered and expressed his deep gratitude for the care and preferential treatment of the military and civilians in the liberated area. Yu is 25 years old and lives at No. 16 Hou Hutong, Wutiao Hutong, Dongsi Archway, Beiping. He has parents and younger siblings. His sister was bombed to death by Chiang's air force in Chengde last year when Chiang's army attacked Rehe.

    陈毅将军探视李仙洲
    李对蒋介石深表不满
    【新华社华东前线二十五日电】华东解放军司令员陈毅将军，于本月十五日上午九时亲往李仙洲住处探询李氏伤口近况，慰问颇殷，李氏感愧至深。谈及莱芜战役时，李氏谓：“此次失败，主要是国防部战略指导错误，而王耀武（按系蒋记徐州绥靖公署第一绥靖区司令官）先生干涉下面太严，亦应负责。王先生每直接分电各军师甚至到团，我虽在前方有时也不知道。”当陈毅将军告以蒋记国防部方面谓此次失败系李氏指挥失当时，李氏苦笑了一下，愤慨地说：“在国民党部队任副职好像当附员，除兼政治部主任或者上级别有来历者外，像我当副司令官，那是没有办法。在济南司令部时，我只是替王先生招呼普通客人，我和王先生也常数天不见面。此次我到前方来，不过是高级的传令兵。例如陈诚到济南来和王先生商谈机密，我都不得参与。我想八年抗战打日本鬼子是应该的。现在打内战是错误的。我早想解甲归田又怕引起王先生的误会疑心。我鄙视他攀升有门，资历不够；不愿屈居其副。”至此李氏灰心叹息道：“我觉得蒋先生用人唯私。”陈毅将军接着说：“照此说来，李先生原是一贯对蒋先生不满的。”李氏虽与陈毅将军初次会面，但纵谈极欢，李氏并尤有相见恨晚之慨。谈话历两小时，陈毅将军以李伤后不宜过于疲劳，乃即告别。陈毅将军旋召见与李仙洲同时就俘之蒋军七十三军及整四十三师高级将校，七十三军少将副军长李琛等九人，为之讲解目前时局与军事形势，并劝勉他们多多视察研究民主设施及中国政治问题，俾和平实现后能对人民有所贡献。临别时，陈毅将军复嘱转达因伤未到之一九三师师长萧事光少将等，表示关切。
    【新华社山东二十三日电】上月莱芜歼灭战中，在莱芜东北和庄上空被击落之蒋记Ｐ５７机驾驶员于振声为蒋空军第三大队第二十八中队少尉飞行员，自被俘获为其治愈伤处后，已于日前抵达解放区“华东蒋军解放军官团”。于氏自述其被击落经过称：上月二十一日晨，蒋军七十三军七十七师就歼于和庄，王耀武在济南以电台失去联络，十分慌急，即驱迫其空军前来侦察；十时四十分，两架飞机同时自济南起飞，于氏所驶者为Ｐ５７式第三六九号。当飞临和庄上空时，见大批放下武器灰色军装之蒋军正被穿黄军装之人民解放军向南押送，两蒋机即低飞扫射。于氏之机以滑润油箱中弹被迫降落，于氏则于跳伞坠地时头脑及腿部均被擦伤，当为解放区民兵所俘，立予治疗，现已告愈。渠对解放区军民之关心优待深表感激。按于氏年二十五岁，家住北平东四牌楼五条胡同后十六号，家中有父母弟弟等人，其姐于去年蒋军进攻热河时在承德被蒋空军炸毙。
