　　Pengcheng Pottery Workers Overturn Their Lives
    Masses Hand Over Confiscated Traitor Kilns to Collective Operation by Workers of Those Kilns
    [Our Paper, Ci County News] Pengcheng Town, Ci County, which mainly produces porcelain, in order to improve the lives of workers, the masses specially handed over the confiscated traitor kilns to the collective operation of the workers of those kilns (currently there are two). At the beginning of the operation, representatives of the masses of the whole town inspected and handed over the original raw materials, tools, and finished products of the two kilns, worth more than 4 million yuan, as a production fund for the original 40-plus workers. Except for a portion used as mass funds (to be returned to the masses after two years), the rest is the workers' own shares. In addition, they can voluntarily buy shares at 10,000 yuan per share. Currently, Zhang Mingliang and Wei Shusheng have been elected as managers from among the workers. Everything in the kiln is decided by all the workers through discussion, and then handed over to the managers for execution, and regular meetings are held for review. Everyone is a shareholder and a worker, and their enthusiasm for production is extremely high.

    群众将没收汉奸窑场交本窑工人集体经营
    【本报磁县讯】以磁业生产为主的磁县彭城镇，为改善工人生活，群众特将没收汉奸的窑场交本窑工人集体经营（现有两个）。开办时，首由全镇群众代表验交两场原有价值四百余万元的原料工具及成品，做为原有四十多个工人的生产基金，除一部做为群众资金（二年后归还群众）外，其余均系工人自己的股金，此外尚可自愿入股，每股一万元。现已由工人中选出张明亮、魏树生为经理，窑上一切事情由全体工人讨论决定后，交经理执行，并定期开会检讨，大家是股东又是工人，生产热情极高。
