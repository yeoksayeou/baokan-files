Establish the Concept of Creating Wealth
    Do Not Let Production Affect Work
    Border Government Summarizes Twenty-Two Days of Production Experience

    [This Newspaper's Report] The Border Government's Production Committee inspected the personal production of the past twenty-two days on March 15th. The entire government, from the leaders to the janitorial staff, participated in this movement and achieved considerable results. In the twenty-two days, more than forty people have spun over forty catties of yarn, Secretary-General Sun spun one catty of machine thread, and eight people completed nine and a half pieces of woolen goods. Other activities such as cotton ginning, sprouting soybeans, grinding tofu, grinding flour, etc., have also yielded considerable results. In agriculture: using "sparrow warfare" tactics, reclaiming wasteland, repairing beaches, and pooling land amounted to more than ten mu, and 130-odd dan of manure were collected. The guards collected a total of over 1,600 catties of manure. Many activists emerged during production. Comrade Zhao Wangdou spun yarn at night for more than ten days, spinning three and a half catties of thread, and got up at the crack of dawn to collect manure. After this stage of production, those who lacked confidence in the past are now full of confidence to complete their production plans.
    The following are some experiences from the twenty-two days of production: 1. The production leadership organization must have concrete organizational work and a clear organizational division of labor in order to effectively promote production. The Border Government's Production Committee is divided into three departments: Handicrafts, Agriculture, and Propaganda, each department responsible for specific organizational work. When spinning yarn, the Handicraft Department solves the problems of funds, raw materials, tools, and sales. Four methods have been formulated: exchanging labor with the masses to weave cloth, organizing cadres' families to weave cloth, earning wages from the masses, and selling to a store in Yangyi. Now there are plans to set standard threads, improve quality, hold "old-timer" meetings (the Border Government has nine experienced spinners) to be hired as technical advisors, and plans to renovate spinning wheels and organize voluntary labor exchange, etc. The Propaganda Department (also the club) publishes red and black bulletin boards, which has played a great role in encouraging production enthusiasm. 2. Production should be carried out according to the specific circumstances of each group. Those who have planted land should not miss the farming season, and those who have not planted land should specialize in spinning yarn. 3. In production, we should first strengthen work and not let the completion of personal production affect work. A collective concept should be established in the group to carry out mutual assistance and labor exchange. Labor exchange should not be completely equivalent to mass production, but the distribution of dividends must be based on the amount of labor time. 4. Comrades working in rural areas should also have certain production tasks and production methods, such as knitting sweaters, writing articles, and selling labor when possible, but because work in rural areas is unstable, their tasks should be appropriately reduced or exempted. 5. We should clearly establish the production concept of creating wealth through labor and prohibit commercial production. (Jiang Dong)

    树立创造财富观念
    不因生产影响工作
    边府总结二十二天生产经验
    【本报讯】边府机关生产委员会，于三月十五日检查二十二天来之个人生产，全机关自首长至勤杂人员，都涌入了这一运动，并获得了相当成绩。二十二天中，四十余人已纺纱四十余斤，孙秘书长纺机器线一斤，八人完成毛织品九件半，其他弹花、生豆芽、磨豆腐、磨面……等亦得不少成绩。农业方面：打麻雀战、开荒、修滩、共地十余亩，拾粪一百三十余担。警卫队战士共拾粪一千六百余斤。生产中涌现了不少积极分子，赵望斗同志夜间纺花十余天纺线三斤半，鸡叫即起来拾粪。经过这一阶段的生产，过去信心不足的，现在都充满着信心，来完成自己的生产计划。
    二十二天生产中，有如下的几点经验：一、生产领导机构，必须有具体的组织工作与明确的组织分工，才能有效的推动生产的进行。边府生产委员会下分设手工业农业与宣传三部，各部负专责进行组织工作。纺花时手工部解决资金、原料、工具、销路问题。并订出了与群众变工织布，组织干部家属织布，挣群众工资，及卖给阳邑一家商店的四个办法。现在又计划定标准线，提高质量，开“老手”会议（边府有九个纺花老手）聘为技术指导，并计划改造纺车，组织自愿变工等。宣传部（俱乐部兼）出红黑榜壁报，在鼓励生产情绪上起了很大的作用。二、生产应该根据各小组的具体情形进行。种了地的应不误农时，没有种地的，就专门纺花。三、在生产中首先应是加强工作，不能因为完成个人生产而影响工作，小组中应树立集体观念，进行互助变工，变工中也不能如群众生产的完全等价，但在分红时必须以劳动时间多少进行分红。四、下乡工作的同志，也应有一定生产任务，生产方式，可以用打毛衣、写稿及可能时的卖工等，但下乡工作不安定，应酌量减免其一部任务。五、应明确树立从劳动中创造财富的生产观念，禁止商业生产。（江东）
