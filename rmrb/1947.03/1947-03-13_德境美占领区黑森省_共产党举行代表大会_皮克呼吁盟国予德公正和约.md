　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Frankfurt dispatch: The Communist Party Congress of Hesse Province, within the US occupation zone of western Germany, opened on the 9th, with over six thousand delegates in attendance. At the congress, both chairmen of the Socialist Unity Party from the Soviet occupation zone delivered speeches. Grotewohl declared: We are awaiting the peace treaty, which will not signify the end of the German people, but their rebirth; the punishment of defeat must not hinder the future of the younger generation, for German youth are without guilt. He then recounted that the Potsdam Agreement stipulated the establishment of a central German government. Chairman Pieck then proclaimed: We do not bear the consequences of the Allies' inability to agree; the fate of Germany is in the hands of the people and depends only on the people's decisions. Pieck continued to relate the inspiring results achieved in the Soviet occupation zone, saying that nationalization is not merely empty words, and land reform has greatly increased the food supply. The meeting closed amidst the singing of "The Internationale" by the entire audience.

    皮克呼吁盟国予德公正和约
    【新华社延安十一日电】法兰克福讯：德国西部美占领区内之黑森省共产党代表大会于九日开幕，与会代表六千余人。会上苏占领区统一社会党两位主席均发表演说，格罗特瓦尔夫宣称：我们在等待着和约，这和约将不是意味着德国人民的完结，而是意味着他们的新生，战败的处分决不能妨碍年青一代的前途，德国青年并无罪过。他继即追述波茨顿协定规定德国成立中央政府。另一主席皮克宣称：我们不承担同盟国间不能协议的后果，德国的命运握在人民手中并且也只依赖人民的决定。皮克继续陈述苏占领区得到令人兴奋的成果，他说国有化并非只是空文，土地改革使粮食供给大为增加。会议在全体听众的自由歌声中闭幕。
