Experiences in the merit campaign in the military
In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu front-line troops, a complete set of experiences has now been created for the merit campaign. From the initiation of merit, merit competitions, mutual assistance in earning merit, to evaluation of merit, recording merit, awarding merit, reporting merit, congratulating merit, and reporting on merit, new experiences are continuously being created in all aspects.

(1) Initiation of Merit
Since the Liberation Daily put forward the merit campaign based on the experience of the Central China People's Liberation Army, various troops believed that this was a more concrete and mass-oriented movement to further the new heroism movement. Thus, it was brewed in the troops. Initially, some troops first organized merit committees from top to bottom and set merit methods, but at that time, the masses did not understand the significance of the merit movement very well, and it did not play a big role. A certain unit took the approach of first discussing among the masses who had contributed to the self-defense war over the past few months. A cook squad leader reviewed that he only had "hard work" but no "merit," but other comrades believed that he also had merit. Thus, from the masses' own review of everyone's merits in the previous period of the self-defense war, everyone's enthusiasm for the merit movement was aroused, and heroic models and activists played a leading role in the merit movement. They also cited the deeds of heroes and models to inspire everyone. Thus, some comrades said: "He is not stronger than me, he can do such a thing, why can't I earn merit?" In this way, the merit movement was launched. Now this movement is not only widely carried out in the front-line combat troops, but also in the logistics and production organs, and it is combined with the specific tasks of the department at present. For example, a platoon of a certain factory saved 1,404 jin of wages and rice and seven sets of single clothes per month in order to earn merit in saving.

In the process of initiating the merit campaign, a ideological problem was also solved - establishing the idea that it is most glorious to earn merit for the people.

(2) Merit Competition
The characteristics of the merit competition are manifested in:

First, the formulation of competition conditions and standards is more practical and meets the requirements of the masses than in the past. In the past, the number of guns seized and prisoners captured was generally used as the evaluation standard, but the current mobile warfare has many specific divisions of labor, such as breaking down roadblocks, building springboards, and climbing city walls. Therefore, the competition standards must be specifically based on the tasks of each group or class. If the task is to pursue the enemy, but the task is abandoned to clean up the battlefield in the middle, then not only will there be no merit, but also criticism will be received. The captured guns should also be mostly distributed to the troops who have completed the prescribed tasks and contributed to them, and should be distributed by the superiors according to the needs of each unit.

Second, advocating "heroes lead the masses, veterans help new soldiers, and everyone helps each other to earn merit." For example, the hero Shi Chongyi, who formulated the "Plan to help new comrades kill enemies and earn merit," is very good. The requirement for veteran fighters to lead new soldiers to earn merit and help each other earn merit is more meritorious than just personal merit.

Third, opposing the scramble for merit. For example, if there is a scramble for things on the battlefield, the merit should be recorded on the side of the person who yields. For example, the practice of Comrade Fang Baichun, a model instructor, in the Juye battle should be recorded; on the contrary, those who compete for prisoners and guns should not be recorded.

(3) Mutual Assistance in Earning Merit

In order to promote the spirit of mutual assistance, the mutual assistance and mutual learning movement is combined with the merit movement to become mutual assistance in earning merit. In order to clarify this point, a certain unit changed the merit committee to the mutual assistance merit committee, and called on heroes to lead their classes, platoons, and companies into hero classes, hero platoons, and hero companies. Only by promoting this collective force can more merit be created and more people's meritorious servants be produced.

(4) Merit Evaluation, Merit Recording, Merit Investigation

Some troops divide merit into three types: major merit, minor merit, and verbal praise. Five praises are counted as a minor merit, and three minor merits are counted as a major merit. The experience of recording merit and evaluating merit is to be cautious and timely. To be cautious, such as in battle, it should be determined according to the size of the role played in the battle, the number of captures, the usual consistent performance, and the situation at the time, and not just according to the amount of his captures to determine the size of his merit. For example, a communicator was seriously injured in the head, and the platoon leader resolutely asked him to go down. He cried and said: "I have not captured anything and cannot complete the merit plan." To evaluate the merit of such a comrade, one cannot haggle over the number of his captures, but must take into account the actual situation and his loyalty to the people. To record merit in a timely manner, in addition to the merit committee paying attention to understanding the situation below, it should also be emphasized that the administrative party club should also go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation and record merit in a timely manner. The process of recording merit is that each class brews, puts forward the class list, the merit committee holds an expanded meeting (cadres above the class and platoon participate) to conduct research, puts forward the entire company list, submits it to the soldiers' congress for discussion and approval, and stipulates that the company merit committee registers the merits of the squad leaders and below, the regimental merit committee registers the merits of the company and platoon cadres, and the brigade political department is responsible for registering the merits of the battalion and regimental cadres.

Establish an inspection system, the regiment inspects once every half a month, the company inspects according to the specific situation of combat training work, and an inspection must be carried out after the battle, and regular inspections are carried out for cadres above the platoon.

When recording merit and awarding merit, do not forget the comrades who sacrificed in the battle without completing their planned combat plan, they should also be evaluated and recorded, and their merits should be reported to their families.

When recording merit, merit cannot be reduced due to demerit, only merit can be offset against demerit.

(5) Reporting Merit

Regarding reporting merit, the 106th unit, according to past practice, wrote letters to tell the local county government and village government and their families about the merit situation at the front; the local government then forwarded the family letters to the front-line troops, encouraging their sons to work hard in the troops.

In this merit movement, they accepted these past experiences and invented the merit report form, reporting the merits of the heroes to his home, village, and county, so that the heroes' relatives and neighbors knew the glory of his merit.

Once the merit report form was invented, it was a great encouragement to the soldiers, and it also played a big role for the newly liberated comrades. After the newly liberated comrades earned merit, they were overjoyed when they saw the letter of condolence from the chief, and they expressed their determination to earn merit for the people.

Based on this experience, the Political Department of the Military Region Field Army printed a large number of "Merit Reports" and distributed them to the troops for use. This merit report form (eight-opening size, lithographed with yellow floral background and red characters) is filled out in two copies, one is sent to the county government for posting, and the other is forwarded to his home for posting on the door or indoors. After receiving the merit report form, the local government may post it at the entrance of the government or on the bulletin board, as the glory of all the people of the county, and send the other copy to the individual's home in a lively manner, and help them write a reply.

(6) Merit List

If there is a new initiative or a meritorious deed that is needed by other units, write the meritorious deed on a larger piece of colored paper in regular script with ink in the name of the chief, and send it to other units under its jurisdiction for posting (such as sending the first battalion to the second battalion in the name of the regimental chief) to encourage everyone to learn from him.

(7) Congratulating Merit

There are several forms of congratulating merit:

First: The chief writes a letter to the subordinate regiment, battalion, or company (depending on the size of the merit), and forwards the congratulation to the individual (at the same time, the county, district, and village can be mobilized to write letters to the front to congratulate him and his unit). Generally, no specific format is specified, and the content is determined according to the specific situation, making appropriate praise and encouragement, and putting forward suitable hopes.

Second: The local government (county, district, village) writes congratulatory letters, congratulatory words, or personally sends cadres to congratulate his family and himself.

Third: The villagers take various forms to congratulate his family.

Fourth: Help his family write a reply, and tell the family about the fruits they have shared, the preferential treatment of the government, etc.

Fifth: For wounded meritorious servants, the political organs of the troops quickly write a letter to him to report his merit.

Sixth: For those who live in the Jiang-occupied area, first record the merit in detail on the merit certificate. If his family is liberated, send the merit report form.

In addition, the Pictorial Publishing House also printed photos of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as local engravings, and presented them to meritorious cadres and soldiers, who could bring them back home. Colored military postcards were also printed for the people's meritorious servants to write home to report their merits. When merit report forms and congratulatory cards pass through the General Post Office of the Military Post, the post office adds woodcut pattern slogans to the envelope. Such as "Self-defense and earning merit, the whole family is honored", "Self-defense and earning merit, the whole village is honored", "Self-defense and earning merit, the whole county is honored", "Heroes lead the masses, everyone helps each other to earn merit", "The people's meritorious servants are the most glorious" (already issued by the front-line political department to the General Post Office of the Military Post).

(8) Merit Flag

Take the company as a unit, make a red flag, and write the names of the meritorious personnel on it, as the company merit flag. Battalions and regiments can also stipulate whose name can be on the battalion merit flag and the regimental merit flag according to the size of the merit. The merit flag can be well preserved at ordinary times, and the merit flag can be displayed whenever an important meeting is held (but be careful not to write the unit number on it to avoid revealing secrets).

(9) Reporting Merit

"Reporting merit and spreading the name everywhere", for comrades who have made merit, it is necessary to quickly "report it", which is a great encouragement to him and the troops. This work has been carried out more systematically recently, and many heroes have been continuously reported in the War Companion Newspaper.

(10) "Three-in-One"

In the mobilization of the Self-Defense War, we put forward slogans such as "Defending the Liberated Areas" and "Defending the Fruits of Emancipation", which can be personally experienced by the fighters in the Liberated Areas; but for the fighters who were liberated from the Chiang Kai-shek army, it is indirect and not specific. The significance of defending the Liberated Areas for them cannot be understood directly at once. After the merit campaign was put forward, the universal slogans were "Everyone earns merit, earns merit everywhere, merit is recorded, merit is rewarded". Such slogans are universally accepted by the three types of fighters, new, old, and liberated, and each starts from their own circumstances to jointly solve the problem of for whom to earn merit. Many liberated soldiers were elected as heroes and received congratulations from the chiefs, and felt that they had been soldiers in Chiang Kai-shek's army for many years, but they were still soldiers. If they fought well, the merit belonged to the officials; the Eighth Route Army fought for the people and for their own liberation, and it was glorious, and everyone could earn merit. They realized that the Eighth Route Army was really different from Chiang Kai-shek's army.

(11) The Convergence of the Two Great Currents of the Merit Movement and the Turn-Over Movement

Reporting merit and congratulating merit have now become mass activities, making the front and the rear, the merit movement and the turn-over movement converge. And it enables the political education of the army and the people to be combined with the living reality of the Self-Defense War, creating an educational method of "people teach soldiers" and "soldiers teach people". After such a real mutual teaching movement, the morale of the troops has been greatly improved, and the commanders and fighters have a further understanding and concern for the goal of fighting for the people and the peasant liberation movement (turn-over). On the other hand, the prestige of the People's Army among the people has been greatly improved, and the social and political status of military families has also been greatly improved.

### 部队立功运动经验

    部队立功运动经验
    立功运动在我冀鲁豫前线部队，现在已经创造出全套的经验。从立功的发动，立功竞赛，互助立功，到评功、记功、奖功、报功、贺功，以及立功的报导等各方面，都在继续创造新的经验。
  （一）立功的发动
    自解放日报根据华中人民解放军的经验，提出立功运动以后，各部队认为这是把新英雄主义运动更加具体化，更加群众化的一个运动，于是就在部队里进行酝酿。最初，有的部队首先由上而下的组织立功委员会，定出立功办法，但当时群众不很了解立功运动的意义，没有起多大的作用。某部便采取首先从群众中讨论几个月自卫战以来谁有功的问题，有一位炊事班长检讨自己只有“苦劳”没有“功劳”，但别的同志则认为他也有功劳。于是就从群众自己检讨自卫战前一段各人的功劳，发动了大家对立功运动的热情，又使英雄模范积极分子在立功运动中起带头作用，又举出英模们的事迹来激励大家，于是有的同志说：“他并不比我强，他能做出那样的事，我为什么不能立功？”这样就把立功运动发动起来了。现在这个运动不只是在前线战斗部队中普遍开展着，而且在后勤及生产机关中也在开展着，并且与本部门在目前的具体任务结合起来了。如××厂一个排为了在节约上立功，每月节约工资米一千四百零四斤，单衣七套。
    立功运动的发动过程中，同时又解决一个思想上的问题——确立为人民立功最光荣的思想。
  （二）立功竞赛
    立功竞赛的特点表现在：
    第一竞赛的条件和标准的订定，比过去的竞赛更切合实际，符合群众要求。过去一般以缴枪，捉俘虏多少，作为评定标准，但目前的运动战，就有着许多具体的分工，如破鹿砦、搭跳板、登城等等，所以竞赛标准要具体根据各组或各班的任务来订。如任务是追击敌人，却放弃了任务在中途打扫战场，那末不但无功，而且要受到批评。俘缴的人枪也应大部分首先分配给完成规定任务有功的部队，并应按照各单位需要，由上级分配。
    第二、提倡“英雄带领群众，老兵帮助新兵，大家互助立功”。如英雄石崇义，订了“帮助新同志杀敌立功计划”，是很好的。对老战士要求带领新兵立功，互助立功，要比只是个人立功功劳大。
    第三、反对争功。如在战场上争缴东西，功就应记在礼让者方面。如模范教导员方柏春同志在巨野战斗中的作法，是应该记功的；相反的，争得俘虏与枪的不应记功。
  （三）互助立功
    为了发扬互助的精神，把互助互学运动与立功运动结合起来，成为互助立功。某部为了明确这一点，把立功委员会改名为互助立功委员会，并号召英雄把自己的班排连都带领成英雄班、英雄排、英雄连。只有发扬这种集体的力量，才能创造出更多的功，产生更多的人民功臣。
  （四）评功、记功、查功
    有的部队把功分为大功、小功、口头表扬三种，表扬五次算一小功，三小功算一大功。记功评功的经验是要慎重及时。要作到慎重，如在战斗中就要根据，在战斗中起的作用大小，俘获多少，平时一贯表现怎样，当时的情况这四方面来决定，而不能只根据他的缴获多少来决定他的功之大小。如有一个通讯员头部负了重伤，排长坚决叫他下去，他哭起来说：“我没有缴获，不能完成立功计划。”像这样的同志评定他的功，就不能斤斤计算他的缴获数量，要兼顾实际情况和他忠于人民的素质。记功要及时，就要除了立功委员会经常注意了解下面情况外，还应强调提出行政上党内俱乐部也应随时深入下层了解情况，及时进行记功。记功的过程是各班酝酿，提出班的名单，立功委员会开扩大会（班、排、以上的干部都参加）进行研究，提出全连名单，交军人大会讨论通过，并规定连立功委员会登记班长以下的功劳，团立功委员会登记连排干部功劳，旅政治部负责登记营团干部功劳。
    建立检查制度，团半月检查一次，连根据作战练武工作具体情形检查，战斗结束后一定检查，并定期进行排以上干部的大检查。
    记功奖功都不要忘记了战斗中未完成其所订战斗计划即牺牲了的同志，同样应该评功、记功，并把他的功劳报告其家属。
    在记功时不能因过减功，只能将功折过。
  （五）报功
    关于报功，一○六部队根据过去部队写信把前方立功情形告诉本县政府和村政权及其家庭；地方政权又把家信转到前方部队，鼓励他们的儿子好好在部队上工作。
    这次立功运动中，他们接受了过去这些经验，发明了报功单，把英雄们的功劳报道他的家里、村里、县里，使英雄们的亲戚邻居都知道他立功的光荣。
    报功单一发明，对战士是一个很好的鼓舞，对新解放的同志也起了好大作用。新解放的同志立功以后，一见到首长慰问信，都欢喜的了不得，纷纷表示决心要为人民立功劳。
    根据这个经验，军区野战政治部又印了大批的“立功报”，分发部队使用，这种报功单（为八开大小，用黄色花底和红字石印）填写二份，一寄县府张贴，一转寄其家张贴于家门或室内。地方政府接到报功单后，可能张贴于本府门口或公布栏，作为本县人民全体的光荣，把另一份用热闹的方法送到本人家中去，并帮助其写回信。
  （六）报功榜
    如有一种新的创举或为别部正需要的一种作法的功劳事迹，用首长名义用较大的一张颜色纸楷书墨笔字，把功劳事迹写上去，送给所属的别部分张贴（如用团首长的名义把一营的送给二营），鼓励大家向他学习。
  （七）贺功
    贺功的形式有几种：
    第一是：由首长写信给所属团、营或连（看功劳大小），并转本人贺功（同时可发动县、区、村写信给前方，向他本人和所属部队贺功）。一般不规定什么格式，由具体情况决定内容，作适当的表扬和鼓励，并提出适合的希望。
    第二是：由地方政府（县、区、村）向其家中及本人写贺功信、贺词或亲自派干部去致贺。
    第三是：同村民众向其家中采取各种形式的贺功。
    第四是：帮助其家中写回信，并告诉家中分得果实，政府优待等情况。
    第五是：负伤的功臣，由部队政治机关迅速写信给他报功。
    第六是：家住蒋占区的，把功劳先详细记在功劳证上，如果他家解放了，就把报功单寄去。
    此外画报社还印了毛主席、朱总司令照片，本刻画等赠给立功的干部及战士，他们又可把这些背回家去。还印制彩色军用明信片，供人民功写信回家报臣功。报功单及贺功片经过军邮总局时，邮局在信封上加盖木刻图案标语。如“自卫立功，全家光荣”，“自卫立功，全村光荣”、“自卫立功，全县光荣”，“英雄带领群众，大家互助立功”，“人民功臣最光荣”（已由前线政治部制发军邮总局）。
  （八）立功旗
    以连为单位，制一红旗，把立功人员的名字都写在上面，作为连立功旗。营团也可以按功劳大小规定谁的名字可以上营立功旗，团立功旗。立功旗平时可好好保存，每逢开重要的大会，即可把立功旗展览出来（但注意不要把番号写上去以免泄露秘密）。
  （九）立功上报
    “立功上报到处传名”，凡是立了功的同志，一定要很快给“上报”，对他本人及部队都是很大的鼓励。这个工作最近进行得较有系统，许多英雄在战友报上都作了连续报导。
  （十）“三合一”
    我们在自卫战争的动员中提出了“保卫解放区”、“保卫翻身果实”等口号，能为解放区的战士所切身体验；但对于蒋军解放过来的战士就是间接的，不具体的了。保卫解放区对他们的意义不是直接的一下子能为他们所了解的。提出立功运动以后，普遍的口号是“人人立功，处处立功，有功记功，论功行赏”。这样的口号，就为新、老、解放三种战士所普遍接受，各从其切身情况出发，而共同达到解决为谁立功的问题。许多解放战士被选为英雄及受到首长们给他贺功后，感到从前在蒋介石队伍里，当了多少年兵，还是一个兵，打仗打的好，功劳是当官的；八路军打仗为老百姓，为自己解放，又光荣，又人人能立功，认识到八路军真是与蒋介石军队不同。
  （十一）立功运动与翻身运动两大巨流的汇合
    报功与贺功，现在已成为群众性的活动了，使前方与后方，立功运动与翻身运动汇合起来。并且使军队与民众的政治教育，通过活生生的自卫战争的现实斗争，互相结合起来，创造了“民教兵”与“兵教民”的教育方法。经过这样的现实互教运动，部队的士气大大提高了，指战员对为人民而战的目标以及对农民解放运动（翻身），都有了进一步的认识与关怀，另一方面，人民军队在民众中的威望大大的提高了，军人家属的社会政治地位也大大提高了。
