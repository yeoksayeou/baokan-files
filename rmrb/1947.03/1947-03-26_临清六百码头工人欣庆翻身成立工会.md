(Report from Jinnan, this newspaper, 24th) The more than six hundred dockworkers in Linqing City, who make a living by building boats, unloading cargo, and transporting goods, have now been organized. A trade union was established at the Mu Shan Theater in the city the other day, and ten regulations on the guild's discipline were formulated. The main spirit is to adhere to the policy of labor-capital cooperation, fair cargo transportation prices, care for goods, and compensation for losses. No fees are charged for transporting belongings for poor military families and honorably discharged veterans. The price for transporting public grain and military supplies is lower than the market price. They advocate thrift and savings, develop sideline production, etc. They take good care of the lives of elderly, weak, and disabled workers. Miao Wenxiang is old and blind, and Xin Liansheng has tuberculosis. Although they cannot work, they are still paid their wages as usual. They call this a small crow repaying the kindness of a large crow. Because of the prosperity of Linqing's commerce and the absence of exorbitant taxes, the workers' lives are improving daily, with some earning as much as 800 yuan per day. At the trade union's founding meeting, worker Hu Chenglin told everyone, "The money I earn now can buy more than one stone of millet. This winter, I wore a brand new three-layer cotton trousers, something I have never had since I was a child. It's truly having plenty of food and clothing!" Zhou Zeyuan said, "Our group of thirty-two people each contributed 1,000 yuan, raising a total of 32,000 yuan to trade in fodder. In less than two months, we made a profit of 200,000 yuan." Guo Zhenqing, a worker from Cheying Street, said, "When the Kuomintang was in power, they forced people to work as corvée labor without pay. The 'International' organized by the Japanese forced us to transport goods for free and even beat us. The current trade union is our own, and we are truly liberated. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao!" (Dao Zhou)

    临清六百码头工人欣庆翻身成立工会
    【本报冀南二十四日电】临清市运河码头，依靠制船卸货运输为生的大把车子工人，现已有六百余人组织起来，日前在该市慕善剧院成立工会，并规定脚行纪律十条，主要精神为本着劳资合作政策，运货价格公平，爱护货物、损失赔偿。搬运贫苦军属及荣退军人东西不取分文，搬运公粮及军用物资，低于市价。提倡节约储蓄，发展副业生产等等。他们对老弱残废工人生活照顾很好，苗文祥年迈眼瞎，新连生有痨病，虽不能劳动，仍然照旧分给工资，他们自称这是小乌鸦报大乌鸦的恩。因临市商业繁荣，又无苛捐杂税，工人生活如日东升，每日收入多者可达八百元。在工会成立大会上，工人胡成林向大家说：“现在我挣的钱能买一石多小米，今年冬天穿上了一件三层新的棉裤，这是我从小没有过的事情，真是丰衣足食了。”周泽远说：“我们组里三十二人，每人出一千元，集资三万二，买卖草料，不到两个月，得利二十万元。”车营街工人郭振清说：“国民党在时抓官差不给钱，组织工会给他们办事。日本在时，组织‘国际’，白运东西还挨打。现在的工会是咱们自己的，咱们真正翻身了。这都是毛主席给的好处。”（道周）
