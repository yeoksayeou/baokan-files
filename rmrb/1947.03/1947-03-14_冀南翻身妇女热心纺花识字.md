Southern Hebei Women Who Have Been Emancipated Are Enthusiastic About Spinning and Learning to Read

[This newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 12th] Women in various parts of Southern Hebei are actively engaged in production and learning culture after their emancipation. Shuang Yinniang of Jizhu Village, Chengci Third District, used to have no house or land. During the rent reduction and land redemption movement, she redeemed more than two mu of land and a residence. She was overjoyed to receive five mu of land during the great emancipation movement. She couldn't stop smiling, and her enthusiasm for life grew stronger. She spun and weaved day and night, influencing her two daughters-in-law to learn from her. Old Ren's wife from Daxia Village is fifty-five years old. When Old Ren died, his son was only four years old, leaving the two of them, mother and son, to beg for more than ten years. During the emancipation movement, they were allocated 6.8 mu of land, and her son was able to farm. He learned how to press oil for others in the oil mill, receiving more than 10,000 yuan in dividends, and also received 300 jin of cotton seeds. Old Ren's wife spun cotton for others early and late, averaging one jin of yarn every five days, earning more than 500 yuan. The women of Qianwang Village, Zaoqiang Fourth District, were divided into two groups after their emancipation, spinning collectively and learning to read. They learned more than fifty new characters in half a month and also learned two emancipation songs. Zhang, an old woman from Zibo Village, Ji County, had begged for more than ten years. She was allocated nine mu of land, with food and shelter, and her son was also able to go to school. After she was allocated land, her family had no fertilizer. She went out to collect manure every day. She often said to others, "We must manage the land well this year since we have been allocated it. My child can also go to school. I have so much enthusiasm for life." Li Erduo, a woman in her twenties from Lijia Village, Hengshui, was beaten and mistreated in her husband's family, eating worse than pigs and dogs. At the struggle meeting, she poured out her grievances, divorced her evil husband, and married a militia member from her village. The couple were very happy. During the campaign to join the army, she mobilized her husband to join the regular army. She is not only a model for mobilizing people to join the army, but also a production model, spinning well and quickly. She was very enthusiastic in the winter school, learning more than a hundred characters in one winter and ranking third in the whole village.
