　　The Battle of Northern Suburbs of Laiwu Proves
    Our Army's Fighting Power Far Surpasses Chiang's Army
    Six Heroes Eliminate 200 Enemies, a Certain Division Eliminates 7,000 Enemies in One Hour
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 14th] Frontline reporter Wu Jianghua reports: In the battle in the northern suburbs of Laiwu, six soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, who lost contact with their unit, fought in the midst of more than two hundred of Chiang's soldiers, eliminating all of them before returning to their unit victoriously. This demonstrates that the political quality and fighting power of the People's Liberation Army far surpasses that of Chiang's army. On February 23rd, the "Hangzhou" unit was pursuing the Fourth Squad of Chiang's army in the northern suburbs of Laiwu. The two combat groups led by squad leader Wu Kuiding, a total of six people, advanced to the woods northwest of Zhangjia Village when they encountered more than two hundred Chiang's soldiers in a follow-up force. Wu Kuiding and his soldiers Zhang Jiashun, Sang Qiwen, Zhou Maofa, Yin Yuxiang, and Dou Fusheng alertly rushed into Chiang's army and engaged in a melee. The six men lost contact with each other, but Chiang's soldiers became even more panicked, and the two hundred plus Chiang's soldiers were completely disorganized. The six of them fought independently and skillfully. Soldier Zhang Jiashun first used a burst of machine gun fire to eliminate a heavy machine gun of Chiang's army on the roadside. On the mountain slope in front of the northern suburbs, a Chiang's soldier was setting up a light machine gun to prepare to fire. He rushed over, grabbed the barrel of the gun, and pressed it down. A burst of bullets passed through his crotch. The hot barrel burned a layer of skin off Zhang Jiashun's hand, but he finally seized the machine gun and swept it in all directions, immediately felling dozens of Chiang's soldiers. He successively captured four machine guns. In front of Yin Yuxiang, a squad of Chiang's soldiers were using a ditch as cover to fire back. A bullet passed through his arm, but he still threw a grenade, liberating nine Chiang's soldiers and seizing a machine gun. Zhou Maofa's machine gun fired burst after burst at Chiang's soldiers. When the bullets ran out, he continued to fire with a newly captured Browning machine gun. Squad leader Wu Kuiding also captured several guns. Dou Fusheng, a newly liberated soldier from the 51st Division, also carried a light machine gun and six rifles seized from Chiang's army. Chiang's soldiers fled in a panic, and the six of them chased and shouted, "Surrender your guns!" "Surrender your guns!" Chiang's soldiers who were caught up raised their hands and laid down their weapons one by one. According to statistics, the six of them captured more than one hundred Chiang's soldiers, seized two heavy machine guns, thirteen light machine guns, and more than fifty rifles. They returned victoriously to their unit with a large group of prisoners and abundant spoils of war.
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 12th] A certain field division of the East China People's Liberation Army took on the task of frontal interception in the Laiwu Campaign and created brilliant achievements. When Chiang's army broke through to a certain area north of Laiwu on the afternoon of February 23rd, the division braved the strafing and bombing of Chiang's planes and annihilated more than 7,000 Chiang's soldiers in one hour, including 4,885 captured alive, including Li Xianzhou and below, and seized a great amount of war materiel.
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th] The fraternal corps of the East China People's Liberation Army closely coordinated in the Laiwu Campaign, creating a brilliant example of annihilating and capturing a large number of Chiang's soldiers with extremely few casualties. After Chiang's army suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the "Guangzhou" troops for three consecutive days, the "Yangtze River" unit annihilated the 579th Regiment of the 193rd Division of the 73rd Army of Chiang's army within one hour at the cost of one death and thirty-two injuries, capturing 956 Chiang's soldiers and seizing all weapons. In the same situation, Hu Regiment of a certain column killed and wounded an uncounted number of Chiang's soldiers in two hours of combat, and captured over 6,000 Chiang's soldiers, including Li Chen, Deputy Commander of the 73rd Army, and Chen Jiong, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 175th Brigade of the reorganized 46th Division, including more than 500 officers of the rank of lieutenant and above. In this battle, the regiment only suffered 24 casualties, a ratio of 1 to 275, and seized 46 artillery pieces alone, consuming only 20,000 rounds of ammunition.

　　莱芜北郊战斗证明
    我军战斗力远胜蒋军
    六勇士歼敌二百某师一小时歼敌七千
    【新华社华东前线十四日电】前线记者吴江华报导：人民解放军某部在莱芜北郊战斗中失去联络的六名战士，在二百多个蒋军当中混战，解决全部蒋军后胜利归队。这说明了人民解放军的政治质量和战斗力远胜蒋军。二月二十三日，“杭州”部在莱芜北郊追击蒋军第四班，班长吴魁定所率领的二个战斗小组共六个人，前进至张家庄西北树林里时，与二百多个蒋军后续部队遭遇，吴魁定及其战士张加顺、桑七文、周茂发、殷于祥、窦福生即机警的冲到蒋军队伍中混战。六个人彼此失去了联络，但蒋军却更加恐慌，二百多蒋军便全部混乱了。他们六个人却独立机敏作战，战士张加顺首先以一梭机枪解决了路边蒋军的一架重机枪，北郊前面山坡上一个蒋军正架起轻机枪准备射击，他一下跑过去抓住枪管往下一按，一梭子弹从他的裤裆穿过去。火热的枪管烫掉了张加顺手上一层皮，可是他终于夺过这挺机枪来，四面扫射，卅几个蒋军立即倒下去，他接连追缴到四挺机枪。殷于祥的前面，一个班蒋军均据沟对击，一颗子弹从他的膀上穿过，他仍旧掷出去一个榴弹，便解放了九个蒋军，夺得了机枪。周茂发的机枪一梭子又一梭子的扫射蒋军，子弹打完了他便以新夺来的一挺勃朗宁机枪来继续射击，班长吴魁定也夺到了好几支枪。窦生是五十一师新解放来的战士，也抬着夺来蒋军的一挺轻机枪和六支步枪。蒋军狼狈窜逃，他们六个就边追边喊“缴枪”“缴枪”，跑着的蒋军一给追到便一个个举手放下武器。统计他们六人共俘虏一百多蒋军、缴获重机枪二挺、轻机枪十三挺、步枪五十多支，他们就带着一大群俘虏和丰富的战利品胜利的回到了自己的部队。
    【新华社华东前线十二日电】华东人民解放军某野战师于此次莱芜战役中担任正面截击，创造光辉战绩。当蒋军于二月二十三日下午突围至莱芜北某地时，该师冒蒋机扫射轰炸，于一小时内歼灭蒋军七千余名，内生俘李仙洲以下四千八百八十五名，缴获甚丰。
    【新华社华东前线十日电】华东人民解放军各兄弟兵团于莱芜战役中密切配合作战，创造以极少伤亡歼俘大批蒋军之光辉战例。“长江”部于蒋军遭受“广州”部队连续三天惨重杀伤后，在一小时内以亡一伤三十二之代价歼灭蒋军七十三军一九三师五七九团，俘蒋军九百五十六人，缴获全部武器。某纵队胡团在同样情况下于两小时战斗中毙伤蒋军不计外，俘蒋军七十三军副军长李琛及整编四十六师一七五旅副旅长陈炯以下六千余人，内尉级以上军官五百余名；是役该团仅伤亡二十四人，为一比二百七十五之比，缴获仅炮类即有四十六门，自己仅消耗弹药二万发。
