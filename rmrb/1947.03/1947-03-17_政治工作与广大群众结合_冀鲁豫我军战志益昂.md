　　Political Work Combined with the Broad Masses
　　The Jiluyu Our Army's Fighting Spirit Soars Higher
　　[Report from Our Jiluyu Frontline Reporter Group, 16th] The political work of General Liu Bocheng's troops has been further enhanced due to the development of the meritorious service campaign and the land reform movement in the rear. The land reform movement among the masses has boosted the fighting will of the troops, while the troops' meritorious service and commendation have enlightened the masses' awareness. The mass-based congratulatory movement for meritorious service has further assisted the political work of the troops. Guo Guisen, a soldier of a certain unit, received letters from his hometown cadres and his father on the Jiluyu front, stating: "During the land reform movement among the masses, our family was allocated twelve mu of land. The village is responsible for all farming and harvesting. Our family of five has enough to eat and wear. You can rest assured and fight the reactionaries on the front line." When a soldier from a certain unit performed meritorious service, the commendation notice was sent to his hometown, Yang'er Village in Lin County. Village cadres went to the family members of the soldier to report the good news and congratulate them. The wife of Yue Guiyuan, a soldier directly under a certain unit, immediately wrote a letter to her husband asking, "So-and-so in our village has performed meritorious service, and local government cadres have come to congratulate them. How glorious! Why haven't I seen your commendation notice?" Yue Guiyuan, after seeing the letter, was anxious and said immediately, "I must perform meritorious service in the next battle." A certain cadre of the frontline political department said, "In the past, when I watched the play 'Frontline,' I didn't feel how intimate it was when Soviet soldiers talked about letters from their lovers in the trenches. I even worried whether it would deepen the soldiers' family concepts, hold them back, and affect the battle. Now I understand the above situation and feel that family letters are very useful for soldiers who shed blood and sacrifice themselves to defend their motherland."

　　政治工作与广大群众结合
    冀鲁豫我军战志益昂
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十六日电】刘伯承将军所部的政治工作，由于立功运动和后方翻身运动的开展，已经进一步提高。群众的翻身运动给部队提高了战斗意志，而部队的立功与报功又启发群众的觉悟，群众性的贺功运动，更帮助了部队的政治工作。某部战士郭贵森，于冀鲁豫前线接获家乡干部及父亲来信称：“在群众翻身运动中，家中分得了十二亩土地，耕种收割，全由村里负责，一家五口，有吃有穿，你可安心在前线打反动派。”某部战士立了功，报功单送到他的故乡林县杨二庄，村干部纷纷向军属的父母报喜、贺功。某部的直属部战士岳贵元的老婆，因为没有接到报功单，马上写了一封信询问他的丈夫说：“咱村××立了功，地方政权干部都来贺功，人家多光荣呀！为什么不见你的报功单？”岳贵元看到信后，急得满头大汗，当即表示：“下次打仗，一定要立功。”前线野政某干部说：“过去我看演‘前线’剧时，觉得苏联战士在战壕里谈论爱人的来信，并不感到怎样亲切，甚至我还耽心是否会加深战士的家庭观念，拖住后腿，而影响了战斗，现在我了解了上述的情形，觉得家信对于为保卫祖国而流血牺牲的战士们，是很有作用的。”
