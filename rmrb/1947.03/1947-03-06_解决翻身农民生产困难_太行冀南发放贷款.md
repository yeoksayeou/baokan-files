　　Solving Production Difficulties for Emancipated Peasants
    Taihang and Southern Hebei Issue Loans
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 2nd dispatch] In order to thoroughly solve the various production difficulties of emancipated peasants, the Taihang Administrative Office and the Taihang District Branch of the Southern Hebei Bank have recently increased agricultural loans by 60 million yuan. Together with previous agricultural loans, the total is 214 million yuan, which is currently being distributed by the county governments and county bank branches throughout the district. In addition, industrial loans of 100 million yuan have been allocated to specifically support iron and wood tool factories, as well as industries such as textiles, paper making, straw hats, and coal mines. After this loan is issued, industry in Taihang will take a further step forward.
    [This newspaper, Southern Hebei, 3rd dispatch] In order to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce, the Third Branch of the Southern Hebei Bank has issued 121.1 million yuan in production loans to support farmers who have obtained land in solving production difficulties (at a monthly interest rate of 1.1%). The bank also convened a joint meeting of managers from county branches and resolved to issue 90 million yuan in agricultural loans this spring, and put forward the following working guidelines: 1. This spring's loans are the bank's main task, and investigations of typical villages and loan preparation work should be completed before the Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects) solar term. 2. Emphasis should be placed on ensuring the resolution of difficulties for newly landed farmers. 3. In the loan area, attention should be paid to poor farmers and disaster victims who have thoroughly turned over and are moving into production villages, as well as small, impoverished villages with production capacity. Appropriate care should be given to military dependents, martyrs' families, and honorably discharged soldiers. Furthermore, in order to support peddlers and small business people in production, it has been decided to issue small business loans of 31.1 million yuan.
    [This newspaper] Changzi will issue 7 million yuan in spring plowing loans to solve the difficulties of livestock power in production for emancipated peasants. In order to make this year's spring loans play a greater role, the County Farmers' Association pointed out that each village should immediately organize a spring loan committee, convene a village meeting, so that the masses understand the significance of the loan, dispel all concerns of the masses about the loan, and at the same time mobilize the masses to invest in buying livestock, and then launch mass deliberation and evaluation. During the evaluation, loans should be issued separately according to the production conditions and the degree of difficulty of the borrowers.
