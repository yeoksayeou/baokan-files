　　Thirteenth Regiment of the Democratic National Construction Army Helps the Masses Carry Water and Grind Grain

　　[This Newspaper's report] Since last winter's rectification, the officers and soldiers of the Thirteenth Regiment of the Democratic National Construction Army have understood that saving civilian labor is the same as supporting the government and cherishing the people. From February 1st to February 25th this year, they transported 84,009 catties of coal, 43,593 catties of grain, and ground 1,923 catties of flour, totaling 4,070 workdays, all done by the officers and soldiers themselves, without asking for a single service. During the same period, the officers and soldiers of the regiment also helped the masses grind grain 792 times, carried water 990 loads, weeded 1,500 catties, and carried coal 120 loads for military families. Song Zhankui, the platoon leader of the First Battalion, carried 45 loads of water for the people in three days. Cook Wang Jinsan always carried a load of water for the villagers before borrowing a villager's bucket, and filled the villager's water vat when returning the bucket. He said, "This way, borrowing the bucket won't affect their water consumption!" Soldier Wen Shigan once promised to grind grain for military dependent Old Lady Li. It happened to be class time, so he asked the squad leader for leave to do it. Sometimes even the regimental commander's horse was lent to the villagers for grinding. The villagers were very touched by this. (Li Bing)

　　民主建国军十三团帮助群众担水推碾
    【本报讯】民主建国军十三团自去冬整训以来，官兵都了解到节省民力就是拥政爱民。自今年二月一日至二十五日，运煤八万四千零九斤，运粮四万三千五百九十三斤，推面一千九百二十三斤，共折工四千零七十个，全是官兵自己作的，没有要一个差。同时期内，该团官兵并帮助群众推碾七百九十二次，担水九百九十担，锄草一千五百斤，替军属担炭一百二十担。一营宋占魁排长三天内替老百姓挑水四十五担，伙夫王金三每次借老乡桶担水，都是先给老乡担一担，还桶时把老乡的水瓮灌满。他说：“这样，咱借桶就不防碍人家吃水嘛”！士兵温士干有一次答应了给军属李老太太推碾，巧逢上课时间，他向班长告准假去办了。还有团长的马有时也借给老乡碾磨。老乡们对这很受感动。（李冰）
