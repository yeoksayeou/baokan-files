    Taihang Factories Increase Production and Achieve Meritorious Service
    Zuoquan Militia Bomb Factory Workers Dedicate Two Hours of Labor Daily
    [Our Newspaper's Comprehensive News] Under the slogan of "Defend Chairman Mao, Strive for Victory in the Counter-Offensive," factories in Taihang are enthusiastically launching a production increase and meritorious service movement. In the past, the Pingding County Explosives Factory used dry molds to make hand grenade and landmine casings, with each person making only sixteen per day. After painstaking research by foundry workers Wang Shuzhi, Wang Shuyuan, Wang Haixiao, and others, they switched to using wet molds, which greatly improved the technology. Now, each person can make an average of sixty-four per day. If a single person makes the mold, they can make one hundred and sixty per day, with a guaranteed yield of over 90%. The factory has already awarded the workers bonuses ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 yuan respectively. All the workers in a certain militia bomb factory in Zuoquan proposed to double the production in March compared to February. Currently, Niu Naidan, a worker in the foundry class, has increased his output from 61 boxes to 100 boxes per day, and has increased the number of roots per person per day from 150 to 240. Technician Huang Junwang voluntarily works two hours of extra labor every day. Under his influence, all the workers in the factory unanimously proposed to dedicate two hours of labor every day. All administrative cadres of the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district Bomb Factory saved 31,600 yuan in supplies for the whole year, and proposed to carry out agricultural production without hindering their work, and to hand over 20% of the proceeds to the public. Workers also voluntarily save two liang of millet per person per day. In the past, the Lishi Xinhua Wood Factory needed twelve to thirteen workdays to make a weaving machine (finished board). Now, they are implementing a small contract system, with piecework scoring. This greatly boosted the workers' morale. Ren Shuangxi took the lead in making iron machines. The first machine took nine and a half workdays, the second took eight workdays, and the subsequent machines were completed in seven workdays. On March 10th, 53 units, with more than 2,000 workers and staff members from various factories, street handicraft workers, and shop employees in Changzhi City, held a mobilization meeting for the meritorious service competition at the Workers' Club. Workers and staff members from various factories, mines, workshops, and shops put forward plans to increase production and achieve meritorious service, announced competitions between factories and individuals, and elected Mayor Huo and 30 other people to form a competition inspection committee. Currently, 90% or more of the employees in twenty factories in the city have formulated specific plans to participate in the meritorious service competition.
