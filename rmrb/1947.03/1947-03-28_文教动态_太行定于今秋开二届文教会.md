    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 25th] The cultural and educational circles of Taihang, in order to better serve the self-defense war and emancipation, as well as the great production movement, have decided to convene the Second Cultural and Educational Conference this autumn to summarize and exchange the achievements and experiences since the First Conference. The conference preparatory committee was established a few days ago. It was decided that the conference content would include: school education, social education, literary and artistic creation, health and childcare, propaganda and mobilization work, newspaper reading and communication, and militia self-study. All cultural and educational workers, including teachers, writers, doctors, nannies, singers, clapper actors, performers, and cultural and educational cadres, as well as collectives and individuals who have been elected as representatives and models by the masses, can attend the conference. The preparatory committee has issued the first notice, calling on all cultural, educational, and health workers in the region to work hard to welcome the conference.
