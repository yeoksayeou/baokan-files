Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Moscow Dispatch: Both Pravda and Izvestia have published commentaries criticizing Truman's speech. Pravda accuses Truman of disregarding the United Nations Organization and questions: If Turkey and Greece are actually feeling threatened, why doesn't the United States lodge a complaint with the United Nations? The newspaper also states: The actions of the United States in aiding Turkey and Greece's imperialist expansionist policies will eliminate the independence of Turkey and Greece and allow the United States to extend its control into those two countries. Izvestia also emphasized that Greece's sovereignty and independence will be harmed by U.S. aid, and the newspaper compared Truman's tone in his speech regarding Turkey to Hitler's tone, noting that Hitler also frequently used the "threat of Bolshevism" to intimidate the world before preparing for acts of plunder.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: United Press reports: Moscow Radio commented on the 15th on Truman's speech to Congress, saying that Truman's remarks violated his promise to follow Roosevelt's policies. The American reactionaries wanted public opinion to accept the change in US policy before Truman delivered this speech, which is an unrestricted expansion, but despite this movement beforehand, Truman's speech still produced extremely strong disapproval.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Athens Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Greek National Liberation Front's resolution on Truman's speech stated: "This speech deeply hurts the honor and prestige of our people. Behind the smoke screen of freedom and democracy, Truman made it very clear that they intend to achieve the goal of dominating the world through monopoly and military control."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: New York Dispatch: In his recent speech to Congress regarding America's "New Foreign Policy," U.S. President Truman requested that Congress lend a huge sum of $400 million to the reactionary governments of Turkey and Greece to help those two governments resist the so-called "communist pressure." Truman's move was welcomed by American reactionaries, and the Hearst-owned Daily Mail, known for its anti-communism, called Truman's proposal "the most resolute anti-communist measure."

　　杜鲁门危害土希独立演说口气极似希特勒
    苏报指责杜鲁门反动演说
    【新华社延安十七日电】莫斯科讯：真理报与消息报先后评论批评杜鲁门演说。真理报指责杜鲁门忽视联合国组织，并质询称：土、希两国在实际上感受威胁，美国何不向联合国控诉？该报又称：美国援助土、希两帝国主义扩张政策之行动，将消灭土、希两国之独立，并使美国控制伸入该两国。消息报亦强调指出：希腊之主权及独立将因美国之援助而受损害，该报并将杜氏所作关于土耳其演说之语气，极似希特勒之语气，盖希特勒在准备掠夺行为之前，亦常以“布尔塞维克之威胁”恫吓世界也。
    【新华社延安十七日电】合众社报导：莫斯科广播于十五日评论杜鲁门在国会之演说称：杜鲁门发表之言论破坏了他遵循罗斯福政策的诺言，美国反动派在杜鲁门发表此项演说前，即欲使公共舆论能接受美政策之转变，此种转变即无限制之扩张，但虽有此种运动于先，杜鲁门演说仍产生极强烈之不利。
    【新华社延安十七日电】雅典讯：希民族解放阵线中央委员评杜鲁门演说之决议称：“此一演说深深的伤害了我国人的荣誉与声望，在自由与民主的烟幕后面，杜鲁门十分清楚的表示了他们意愿以垄断及军事管制来达到统治世界的目的”。
    【新华社延安十五日电】纽约消息：美总统杜鲁门最近在国会关于美国《新外交政策》之演讲中，要求国会以四亿美元巨款借与土耳其与希腊反动政府，以便协助该两国政府用以抵制所谓“共产主义压力”，杜鲁门此举得到美国反动派之欢迎，而以反共著称之赫斯特系之每日邮报，将杜鲁门之建议称为“最坚定之反共措施”。
