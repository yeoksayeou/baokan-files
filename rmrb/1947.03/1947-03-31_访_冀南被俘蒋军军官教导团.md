    Visiting the "Jinan Captured Chiang Army Officer Training Group"
    [This Newspaper, Jinan, 29th Dispatch] This reporter recently visited the "Jinan Captured Chiang Army Officer Training Group." The majority of this unit consists of field grade and company grade officers from the 125th Brigade and 104th Brigade, captured in the previous Hua County battle. Eighty percent are from Sichuan. During the two months of study, they found the truth and are willing to fight to realize the truth. In a record of a discussion meeting, the following was written about the speech of trainee Tian Shunjiang: "In Chiang Kai-shek's army, we were told that the Eighth Route Army practiced communism by sharing wives, killed ordinary people, and that all captured Central Army soldiers would be killed. When I was captured, I thought I would surely die. I didn't expect the Communist Party to be so lenient. What Chiang Kai-shek's officers said was completely shameless slander." Trainee Lü Chizhong wrote a new poem, narrating his nine years of military life, ending with "Fortunately I didn't die, I have been reborn!" to express his unexpected joy. When the training group started, trainee Yao Chong called on everyone in his report: "We have broken through the killing field and been liberated from the clutches of fascism. This is our new life. We must embrace the attitude of 'all things before are as if dead yesterday, all things after are as if born today' and work hard to study and become new people." His call is exactly what everyone has in mind; a wave of learning enthusiasm quickly swept through. Every new book that arrives is read first; Zhang Ruhuan, a trainee from the second team, has already read "On New Democracy" four times. He often says: "Chairman Mao's books are so captivating, the reasoning is so correct." He is now studying "On Protracted War" in detail. In the study of current events, everyone's eyes are gradually brightening. Trainee Wang Youren's two "Occasional Thoughts on Current Affairs" read: "The Japanese invaders have already surrendered, why is the fire of war still raging? Single-mindedly wanting to be emperor, not hesitating to sell out air rights. After the war, how can he continue to be a dictator, conscripting soldiers and levying grain everywhere; he wants to capture all compatriots, come here to turn over a new leaf!" In the room of the political commissar of the second team, several trainees were talking. When the reporter asked them about their thoughts on Hu Zongnan's attack on Yan'an, Yang Zhigang (lieutenant adjutant of Chiang's army's 125th Brigade) told the reporter: "This is called 'the king delivering vegetables'. Another Laiwu second!" Wu Shude (captain of Chiang's army's 104th Brigade) said: "The political, military, and economic crisis of the four major families has reached the point of being incurable. His attack on Yan'an is called 'tadpoles chasing ducks - rushing to die'." Lü Chizhong and Chen Si'an, using the vivid history of the Sichuan army, exposed Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to use the people and eliminate miscellaneous troops. They said angrily: "We will use our personal experience to tell all the officers and soldiers in Sichuan and Chiang Kai-shek's army that for the liberation of the elders in Sichuan and for the liberation of the Chinese people, quickly launch armed uprisings and unite with the people in the liberated areas to end the fascist rule of the Chinese thief Chiang Kai-shek and establish an independent, democratic, peaceful, and unified New China."

    访“冀南被俘蒋军军官教导团”
    【本报冀南二十九日电】记者日前访问“冀南被俘蒋军军官教导团”该部多是一二五旅、一○四旅的校尉军官，是在前次滑县战役中被俘的，百分之八十为四川人。在两个多月的学习中，他们找到了真理，并愿为实现真理而奋斗。在一个讨论会的记录上，这样写着学员田顺江的发言：“在蒋介石的军队里，告诉我们八路军共产共妻、杀害老百姓、捉往中央军一律杀掉，我被俘时，以为必死无疑，想不到共产党这样宽大，蒋介石军官讲的那一套完全是无耻的造谣。”学员吕持中写了一首新诗，叙述九年戎马生活之后，用“幸甚没有死，我倒新生了！”作结语，来表示他意外的欢欣。教导团开学时，学员姚重在汇报上号召大家：“我们冲开杀人的屠场，从法西斯的魔掌里解放出来，这是我们的新生，我们要抱‘以前种种譬如昨日死，以后种种犹如今日生’的心情努力学习重新作人。”他这号召也正是大家的心意；学习热潮很快掀动起来。每页新书寄来，都先睹为快；二队的学员张如汉已把《新民主主义论》读了四遍，他常常说：“毛主席的书一看就把人吸住了，道理说得真对。”他现在又在精读《论持久战》了。在时事学习中，大家的眼睛逐渐明亮起来。学员王友仁两首《时事偶感》云：“日寇投降已经矣，何故烽火又滔天？一心要当皇帝，不惜出卖领空权。战后伺堪再独裁，抓丁派粮遍地哀；全国同胞要擒之，要想翻身这里来！”在二队政委的房间里，有几个学员在那里面谈，记者以胡宗南进攻延安询问他们的感想时，杨志刚（蒋军一二五旅中尉副官）告记者说：“这叫作‘大王运菜’。再来一个莱芜第二啊！”吴树德（蒋军一○四旅上尉）说：“四大家族的政治、军事、经济危机已到不可救药的地步，他进攻延安，这叫作‘蝌蝌赶鸭子——抢死’。”吕持中、陈思安两人，以川军的生动历史、揭露了蒋介石利用人民、消灭杂牌的阴谋，他们怒色的说：“我们将以亲身经验告诉川及蒋介石一切官兵们，为四川父老的解放，为中国人民的解放，赶快举行武装起义，和解放区人民在一起，结束中国贼蒋介石法西斯统治，建立独立、民主、和平、统一的新中国。”
