    Youths in Boyan Town, Wu'an
    Abandon Feudal Customs and Adopt New-Style Weddings
    [Our Dispatch] On the 16th of last month, six young couples in Boyan Town, Third District of Wu'an, held a new-style wedding, eliminating feudal customs and saving a great deal of money. Li Youxin, the political director's son, got married and, for the sake of thrift, switched to a new-style wedding. The other five families in the town who were also marrying off their children on that day joined together. The Li family alone saved eighty-two laborers worth of manpower for carrying sedan chairs, saved over 18,000 yuan in food money for two meals, 5,000 yuan in firecracker and gunpowder expenses, and avoided inviting guests to seventeen tables, saving 24,000 yuan. During the wedding ceremony, the parent Kong Jingjin said, "Parents should not have feudal ideas in the future, they should let their children find partners freely, and eliminate wasteful practices such as gift-giving to seek savings." The groom Lu Xiyuan said, "I am a tenant farmer. If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to turn ourselves around, I would be a bachelor for the rest of my life." The bride Zhai Shuxian said, "I used to be oppressed by the old society and married a bully; today, with the democratic government, I can marry freely, which has relieved me of a lifetime of pain. This is thanks to Chairman Mao's kindness."

    武安伯延镇青年
    去掉封建旧俗  改行新式婚礼
    【本报讯】武安三区伯延镇于上月十六日六对青年男女举行新式结婚，去掉封建习俗，节约很大。政治主任李有信的儿子结婚，为节约起见，改为新式结婚，本镇其余五家也在这天娶亲，六家即联合举行。李同志一家即节省抬轿等人工八十二个，省两顿饭钱一万八千余元，鞭炮火药费五千元，少请客十七桌，省二万四千元。举行婚礼时，家长孔敬金说：“以后当父母的不应有封建思想，应让儿女自由找对象，去掉送礼等一套浪费，以求节省。”新郎路喜元说：“我是个佃户，要不是毛主席领导咱翻身，就会当一辈子光棍。”新妇翟淑贤说：“我从前受旧社会逼迫，和一个恶霸结婚；今天有了民主政府，才能自由结婚，去了我终身痛苦，这是毛主席的恩情。”
