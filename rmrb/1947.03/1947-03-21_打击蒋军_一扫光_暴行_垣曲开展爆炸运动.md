    Hitting Back at Chiang Kai-shek's Troops' "Sweep Away All" Atrocities
    Yuanqu Launches Explosion Campaign
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 19th dispatch] Yuanqu has launched a struggle against the "Sweep Away All." Since the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops re-occupied Yuanqu last year, they have been carrying out "Sweep Away All" looting and rape in the border areas of the first, third, and fourth districts and around strongholds such as Gaoluo. Wherever they go, cattle, donkeys, quilts, clothes, grain, farm implements, etc., are "swept away." In Liuzhang Village, two families were robbed of 32 quilts in one instance. The four members of landlord Yu Sihai's family had all their clothes stolen, leaving them with only one tattered quilt. In Shanggudui, 23 cattle were stolen in one instance, even the mulberry twig winnowing basket of Bao Wuying, a member of the farmers' association committee, was stolen. They also raped women everywhere. In Shugeta, four young women from five families were violated, even the wife of Lu Qingwen, the puppet village chief of the first district, was not spared. This inhuman, bestial behavior has aroused the resistance of the local people, who are actively launching a struggle against the "Sweep Away All." Since the end of last year, many villages have stopped maintaining the status quo, implementing a scorched earth policy and transforming life into a combat footing. Villages close to strongholds have also moved to mountain villages in the countryside, further developing the explosion campaign. The Second District has also carried forward the glorious tradition of the anti-reversal-of-settlements struggle, striking at the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops' "Sweep Away All" everywhere. When Old Wang's cattle were stolen in Changzhi Village, militiaman Chen Tonglin and others sneaked to Liugou near Gaoluo in the middle of the night, pulled the cattle back, and returned them to their original owner. When a unit of puppet troops went to Yandui to loot, six people were killed or wounded by explosions before they even entered the village. Now the Third District has also started this struggle.

    打击蒋军“一扫光”暴行
    垣曲开展爆炸运动
    【本报太岳十九日电】垣曲展开反“一扫光”斗争。自蒋伪军去年再占垣曲后，便在一、三、四区边沿地带和皋落等据点周围进行“一扫光”的掠夺和奸淫。所到之处，牛驴被子衣服粮食农具等“一扫而光”。刘张村两个闾一次被抢走被子三十二条，地主于四海家四口人衣服被抢光，只剩下一条破被。上古堆一次抢走牛二十三头，连农会常委包五英的桑枝簸箕都被抢走了。又到处奸淫妇女，树圪塔五户人家的四个青年妇女均被蹂躏，连伪一区村长吕清文的老婆也不能幸免。这种丧失人性的野兽行为，已激起当地人民的反抗，积极展开反“一扫光”斗争。自去年年底到现在已有不少村子停止了维持，实行空舍清野，生活战斗化。靠近据点的村庄，也都转移到野外山庄，更进一步的展开了爆炸运动。二区更发扬了反倒算斗争的光荣传统，到处打击蒋伪军的“一扫光”，长直村老王的牛被抢走，民兵陈同林等深夜摸到皋落附近的柳沟将牛拉回，交还原主。伪军某部到堰堆去抢掠，还没进村即被炸死伤六人。现三区也开始了这个斗争。
