Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. According to a report from Peiping on the 25th by Associated Press reporter Roderick: Taiwanese residents in Peiping recently issued a statement regarding the Taiwan autonomy movement, pointing out that the "February 28th" incident was forced by "rulers who are worse than the Japanese, completely disregarding the lives and property of Taiwanese people." The statement said: "Our enemies—those unscrupulous and corrupt officials who were sent to rule our beloved island—have destroyed Taiwan with their greed and incompetence. In their year in power, they have destroyed all laws and order and brought hunger and bankruptcy to the peninsula. This is the basic reason for this 'tragedy.' The corrupt authorities abandoned the law-abiding and peace-loving Taiwanese people and gave all senior administrative positions to their relatives and friends. Frenzied speculation and insatiable greed have led to the destruction of all industries and the loss of livelihood for 800,000 Taiwanese people." Roderick said that the statement could not be published in the newspaper because the Kuomintang government prohibited the publication of any news about the Taiwan incident in the newspapers.

    平市台湾籍居民发表声明
    谴责蒋政府逼成台变
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据美联社记者罗得利克二十五日自北平报导：平市台湾籍居民最近发表关于台湾自治运动之声明，指出“二、二八”事件是由“比日人更坏的当政者，对台人生命财产完全忽视”所逼出来的，该声明称：“我们的敌人——那些被送来统治我们可爱海岛的肆无忌惮的腐化的官员们，以他们的贪暴与无能而毁灭了台湾，在他们当权的一年间，他们毁坏了一切法律与秩序，并给半岛带来了饥饿与破产，这就是这场“悲剧”的基本原因，腐败当局摈弃了守法的爱好和平的台人，而把一切高级行政职位给了他们的亲友，疯狂的投机与永无满足的贪婪，带来了一切工业的毁灭与八十万台人的失去生计”。罗得利克说该声明因国民党政府禁止一切有关台湾事件消息在报纸发表，故亦未能在报纸登载。
