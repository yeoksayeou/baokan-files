    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: A unit of the people's local armed forces in Nantong, Central Jiangsu, captured Sanyu, a key town 50 li east of Nantong, on the 18th. All of the Nationalist-held Jiangsu Provincial Security Team and Industrial Security Team, each one platoon, and over 400 "Homecoming Corps" members were annihilated. The unit seized 15 light and heavy machine guns, and over 200 rifles. Sanyu is located on the coast of the Yellow Sea, commanding the traffic arteries of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen and Qidong. The surrounding dozens of li are rich in cotton production, making it an important cotton area in Central Jiangsu. The Nationalist army occupied the town in early December last year, attempting to block traffic and plunder cotton, and massacred hundreds of people. This caused the area within a dozen li of the town to become desolate and uninhabited. This victory not only dealt a major blow to the Nationalist-puppet blockade, but also rescued over 100,000 people in the area from misery.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army behind Nationalist lines in Central Jiangsu, recovered the important stronghold of Sichang on the Hai'an-Libao line in ten minutes on the night of the 10th. It annihilated the enemy garrison and the Nationalist "Self-Defense Forces" of two townships, capturing over 90 and killing or wounding several. Dozens of mobile blockade bunkers of the Nationalist army between Libao, Xichang and Yanghe were completely destroyed, effectively supporting the anti-"encirclement and suppression" efforts of the (Rugao) Eastern County people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: In order to unify and strengthen the leadership of the local struggle in the Yancheng-Huaihai regions, which stand firm behind Nationalist lines, the Northern Jiangsu Military Region has been established. Chen Qingxian is appointed commander, and Cao Diqiu is appointed political commissar. The military region governs vast rural areas spanning nineteen counties from the coast of the Yellow Sea in the east, to the Grand Canal in the west, to Majiadang in the south, and to the Longhai Railway in the north. It has a population of over six million, and is connected to Shandong, Huaibei and Central Jiangsu, forming a contiguous area.
