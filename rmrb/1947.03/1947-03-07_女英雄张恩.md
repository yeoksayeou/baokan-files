　　Female Hero Zhang En
    "On the battlefield between two armies, fighting with swords and spears, heroes are indispensable." This is the evaluation of Comrade Zhang En at the Nanhua Heroes Meeting. The Nanhua Gangyi District was able to persist in its position throughout the four months of guerrilla warfare, and this was inseparable from the arduous struggle of female hero Comrade Zhang En.
    Comrade Zhang En is the director of the Gangyi District Joint Association. After Heze was evacuated, the enemy's large army advanced northward, and some cadres were pessimistic and wavering for a time, and the masses were frightened and panicked, and fled one after another. At this time, Comrade Zhang En was calm and composed. She thought that controlling the cadres was a big job, so she immediately gathered the cadres and mobilized and explained to them overnight. She said, "It doesn't matter, you are all locals, follow the masses, in groups of two or three, and you can persist even if it is serious." This stabilized everyone. From then on, Comrade Zhang En shouldered a gun and led the armed work team to carry out activities. When they arrived at He Village, the masses there asked: "Are you part of Zhang En's group?" "Yes!" "Then we are not afraid here."
    Comrade Zhang En, suffering from severe gynecological problems, ran around day and night. Every time she came back from an expedition, she would always have stomach pains as usual, but she didn't say a word. In October of last year, the enemy entered Youlou. As soon as the gunshots rang out, everyone in the village ran away. Comrade Zhang En stood in the deep water, and shells exploded beside her. She thought that there were still twenty boxes of grenades stored in Zaowang Village, and they must be taken out. If they were lost, the people would punish us. She said to the cadres: "Go, I'll take you!" The comrades were moved and said: "Director Zhang is not afraid of death, what are we afraid of?" At night, Comrade Zhang En forgot the pain of her illness, led everyone carrying guns, with a few grenades tied around their waists, wading through waist-deep water, and sent the bombs to the rear.
    After the enemy largely crossed Nanhua and penetrated into our central area, Comrade Zhang En led her guerrillas to attack the Chiang Kai-shek military stronghold in Xiao Lao's home. In order to punish a bad guy, she worked in the Zhanglou Temple, braving the bone-chilling cold, until midnight. When Comrade Zhang En received an order from her superiors to return to the rear, the masses, upon hearing this, grabbed Zhang En's hand and said, "If you jump into the well, we will jump into the well with you. If you leave, who will we rely on?" When Comrade Zhang En saw the elders crying, she couldn't bear to leave the masses and let them be ravaged by the traitors. She couldn't help feeling a pang of sadness and shed tears, and left He Village with great difficulty.
    After arriving at the rear and sending off the other cadres, her superiors asked her: "Where are you going?" She said: "I'm not going anywhere. I am determined to go back to Nanhua to persist in my work and struggle. I would rather die in Nanhua!" Her superiors agreed to her request, and Comrade Zhang En returned to Gangyi District. The people felt like they had seen a relative and felt that they had someone to rely on. Now, Zhang En's guerrillas are carrying out unremitting struggles against the enemy behind enemy lines.

　　女英雄张恩
    “两军阵前动刀兵，阵阵离不了英雄。”这是南华群英会上对张恩同志的评语。四个月的游击战争，南华岗义区能始终坚持着阵地，是与女英雄张恩同志艰苦奋斗分不开的。
    张恩同志是岗义区的联合会主任。荷泽撤出后，敌人大军北进，某些干部曾一度悲观动摇，群众恐惧惊慌，纷纷逃避。这时，张恩同志沉着镇定，她想，掌握干部是个大工作，马上集合了干部，连夜进行动员和解释。她说：“不要紧，你们都是本地人，跟着群众，三两个人一组，再严重也能坚持。”稳定了大家。从此，张恩同志扛起了枪，带领着武工队活动起来。他们走到何庄，那里群众就问：“你是张恩那部分不？”“是的！”“那俺们这里就不怕了。”
    张恩同志带着沉重的妇女病，日以继夜的奔波，每次出发回来，总是照例的肚子疼痛，但她一声也不响。去年十月间，敌人进了游楼。枪声一响，村里人都跑了，张恩同志站在深水里，炮弹在她的身旁爆炸，他想起灶王庄还存着二十箱手榴弹，一定得弄出来，损失了人民会惩罚我们的，她对干部们说：“走，我带着去！”同志们被感动的说：“张主任还不怕死，咱怕什么？”夜里张恩同志忘记了病的痛苦，领着大家扛着枪，腰上撇着几个手榴弹，趟着腰深的水，把炸弹送到了后方。
    在敌人大部越过南华深入我中心区后，张恩同志带着她的游击队员，袭击肖老家蒋军据点，为了惩罚一个坏蛋，她在张楼小庙里，冒着彻骨的寒风，一直工作到半夜。当张恩同志接得上级命令要回后方时，群众听说纷纷拉着张恩的手说：“你跳井俺跟你跳井，你走了俺依靠谁呀？”张恩同志见父老们哭了，自己也不忍抛开群众去让他们受汉奸们的蹂躏，禁不住一阵心酸，落下泪来，很难过的离开了何庄。
    到了后方，送走了别的干部后，上级问她：“你去那里？”她说：“我那也不去，我坚决要回去到南华坚持工作，坚持斗争，死也死在南华！”上级答复了她的要求，张恩同志回到岗义区，人民像见了亲人，觉得有了靠山。现在，张恩的游击队，正在敌后对敌人进行不息的斗争。
