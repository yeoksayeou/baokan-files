　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: According to Central News Agency dispatches and Shanghai newspapers, shops in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan Province, once went on strike, and National Taiwan University also went on strike for a time in response to the Taiwan autonomy movement. The Chiang Kai-shek government in Taiwan is frantically suppressing the people's autonomy movement. More than 200 leaders and more than 20 students from all over Taiwan have been detained. Taiwan representatives in Shanghai who agreed with the Taiwan autonomy proposal lost their freedom of movement after arriving in Taiwan. Although National Taiwan University has been ordered to resume classes, only a few students are attending.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 13th, two divisions of the Kuomintang army have set sail for Taiwan from Shanghai to suppress the people's autonomy movement in the province. Some military supplies originally scheduled to be shipped to the civil war front have also been diverted to Taiwan. Various signs indicate that the Chiang Kai-shek government's bloody suppression of the people of Taiwan has already begun.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Shanghai News: Wenhui Daily reported on the situation on the eve of the outbreak of the Taiwan autonomy movement, saying: Throughout Taiwan under Kuomintang rule, the painful cries of the people could be heard everywhere. Those ragged Kuomintang troops looted everywhere, thinking "What's yours is mine," which deeply disappointed the people of Taiwan. Most of the officials at all levels under Chen, the chief executive of the Kuomintang's Taiwan administration, were personnel from the puppet Manchukuo and Wang Jingwei's regime. They all spoke Japanese, and their only achievement was to impose harsh taxes and levies. The people were extremely resentful and posted slogans everywhere such as "The evil wolf Japanese devils are gone, and the evil tiger Kuomintang has come." Prices in Taiwan have soared, a hundred times higher than in 1937. One in ten people is starving, and most children are forced to drop out of school. The streets and alleys are filled with the miserable cries of selling sons and daughters.

　　响应自治运动台北一度罢课罢市
    蒋军两师已由上海开往台湾
    【新华社延安十六日电】据日前中央社电讯及沪报透露：台湾省会台北商店曾一度罢市，台湾大学亦曾一度罢课，响应台湾自治运动。台湾蒋记政府对人民自治运动疯狂镇压，台湾各地领袖二百余人及学生二十余人已被拘禁，赞同台湾自治主张之台湾旅沪代表在抵台后即失去行动自由，现台大虽被追复课，但到校学生寥寥无几。
    【新华社延安十五日电】据合众社上海十三日电称：国民党军两师已由上海开往台湾，用以镇压该省人民自治运动，原定运往内战前线之若干军需品，亦改运台湾，各种象征显示蒋政府对台民之血腥镇压，业已开始。
    【新华社延安十七日电】沪讯：文汇报报导台湾自治运动暴发前夕状况称：国民党统治下的台湾到处听到人民痛苦的呼吁，那些衣衫褴褛的国民党军队到处抢掠，“你的就是我的”，使台湾人民深感失望。国民党台湾行政长官陈下面的各级官员，多数都是伪满和汪记属代的人员，他们的讲话都用日语，唯一的政绩是苛征暴敛。人民愤恨到极点，到处张贴“去了恶狼日本鬼，来了恶虎国民党”等标语。台湾物价暴涨，较一九三七年高百倍，十个人中即有一人挨饿，多数儿童被迫失学，街头巷尾充满凄叫卖儿女声。
