The Construction Department of the Border Region Government compiled this article.

The material on Shi Zhenming is very complete, but due to space limitations, we can only introduce the most prominent aspects: the combination of agricultural and sideline production, the combination of war service and production, and his outstanding leadership points, for reference by various regions in carrying out the great production movement this year.

Shi Zhenming is the Wu Manyou of the Taiyue Area

The old hero Shi Zhenming is sixty-four years old this year. In his early years, he worked as a kiln worker for sixteen years. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, due to a famine, he fled from his hometown of Lin County, Henan, to Huabaogou in Ji's family to work as a tenant farmer. The landlord forced him back to Lin County, but he still could not make a living there. He was then forced to work as a tenant farmer in Kongzhi Shibankou (belonging to Ji's family). The landlord, Li Changjiu, wanted to seize his land. Although he hosted a banquet to plead with people, he was still driven away, and the iron plow was confiscated, and the accumulated fertilizer was thrown into the Qin River.

In the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, he moved to Ximugong Mountain in Fancun, Fushan County, as it is now. He rented a barren slope and borrowed a small donkey, plowing the land under the moonlight at night and reclaiming wasteland during the day. In the first year, he harvested twenty dan of coarse grains, paid ten dan in rent, and used seven dan to pay burdens and debts to the Central Army, leaving his whole family with only three dan of coarse grains. Hunger and cold constantly threatened him.

In May of the thirtieth year, the Eighth Route Army's Dare-to-Die Corps (the Shanxi New Army led by Comrade Bo Yibo) arrived in Fushan. The Communist Party and the Anti-Japanese Government issued a call to reduce rent and interest and announced a one-year reduction or exemption of burdens, and a five-year exemption of rent and burdens for newly reclaimed land. Lao Shi breathed a sigh of relief. In the thirty-first year, he newly reclaimed twenty-five mu of wasteland and delivered thirty dan of public grain. In the thirty-second year, the in-depth rent reduction and interest reduction movement was carried out in Yuenan, and Shi Zhenming was liberated from heavy rent and exploitation. In the thirty-third year, he first organized eighteen mutual aid groups with full labor, with a total of twenty-one mutual aid groups in Fancun (only Shi Zhenming's remained after the autumn harvest). Within three years, he increased the reclamation of sixty-five mu of wasteland, cultivating a total of one hundred and twenty mu of land, harvesting ninety-seven dan of grain, raising six cattle, one donkey, and eighty sheep, and hiring one cattle worker, one sheep worker, and one long-term worker.

In the spring of the thirty-third year, he was elected as a labor hero of Fushan County, and at the end of the year, he was elected as a labor hero of the entire Taiyue Area. Up to now, he has developed a joint brigade of five administrative villages, established a mixed business cooperative serving the masses, founded a private primary school, and created a model for combining war service and production. He truly embodies Chairman Mao's advocacy of typical cases driving general leadership, the combination of leading cadres and the masses, and has cultivated a large number of new heroes, forming the direction for developing a new type of rich peasant economy, acknowledged by everyone as the Wu Manyou of the Taiyue Area.

Organizational Scale of Shi Zhenming's Mutual Aid Brigade

In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Shi Zhenming's mutual aid group developed into a mutual aid brigade, with a total of forty-eight groups, two hundred and fourteen male laborers, and eighty-one female laborers. In the thirty-fifth year, it developed into a joint brigade of five villages, including two hundred and thirteen groups in ninety-one natural villages, one hundred and twenty-three male groups, and ninety female groups, six hundred and fourteen male full laborers, four hundred and seventy male semi-laborers, seven hundred and twenty-five female full laborers, two hundred and seventy-seven female semi-laborers, one hundred and fifty-seven children, ninety hired workers, eighty-six cattle and sheep workers, forty-seven disabled people, and eleven carpenters, totaling two thousand four hundred and eighty-nine people.

The number of textile groups increased to one hundred and nineteen, with one thousand and fifty-three female spinners, three hundred and sixty-nine yokes of livestock, totaling seven hundred and thirty-eight animals.

Method of Calculating Work and Converting Work in Agricultural Mutual Aid

The realization of the equal value policy is one of the main conditions for such consolidation and development. The basic principle of calculating work for different types of labor is to base it on labor, supplemented by technology, and standardized by results. For example, the exchange of labor in agriculture is as follows: a male full laborer hoeing the ground and carrying wheat is worth ten points, a semi-laborer sweeping the threshing ground and rolling the stone roller is also worth ten points, a woman shelling corn and cutting grain is also worth ten points, a child helping with the sowing machine and collecting seeds is worth five points, and a full laborer carrying manure and reclaiming wasteland is worth ten points, while a semi-laborer is worth seven or eight points, depending on the situation. The combined method of calculating and converting work is as follows: in sideline and agricultural labor, and in women's sewing labor exchange, making a pair of shoes is worth six work points, making a pair of socks is worth three work points, sewing two pairs of single pants is worth one work point, and a cloth shirt is worth one work point. In spinning labor exchange, weaving two zhang of cloth is worth one work point, carding five jin of cotton is worth one work point, and spinning four liang of cotton is worth one work point. A woman taking care of three children for a day is worth one work point, and taking care of one child for three days is worth one work point. Cooking nine meals is worth one work point. The exchange of labor between people and livestock is that plowing one mu of land with a cow is worth one work point, plowing one and a half mu of stubble land is worth two work points, plowing two mu of wheat stubble is worth one work point, and plowing seven mu of wetland is worth one work point.

Secondly, for the small cowherds, letting the cattle out to graze in the fields in the early morning to do work is worth two work points. After breakfast, the four cowherds are organized into two shifts, two herding and two participating in mutual aid. Whoever they work for, they eat their food. Cowherds earn more money, cow owners save grain, and cowherds can also cut firewood and collect manure during the grazing time. Cutting one hundred and twenty jin of firewood is worth ten work points, and collecting one hundred and twenty jin of manure is worth ten work points. The surplus work of hired workers participating in the mutual aid group belongs to the hired workers. Disabled people and children exchange labor. Small merchants go to the market to trade and carry goods to participate in mutual aid. Those who specialize in making shoes and those who specialize in spinning exchange labor. Women who cannot spin cook and take care of children for those who can spin. Old men in their sixties who cannot do heavy work participate in the spinning group. Winding one jin of thread is worth one work point, and twisting three jin of cotton is worth one work point. Carpenters work for the mutual aid group, and the mutual aid group cultivates land for the carpenters. A carpenter's work is worth five sheng of rice, and agricultural labor is worth three sheng of rice. Transportation organizations buy sixty jin of cotton for the textile group, which is worth one work point. The combination of transportation and agricultural labor is based on the group. The transporters eat communally, and the earned work points are divided four-six (six for the transporters and four for those at home).

The cooperative issues work tickets to the agricultural mutual aid organization free of charge and supplies agricultural implements. For the textile group, it supplies raw materials and sells finished products. It buys foreign knitting machines to knit socks to solve the difficulty of having more spinners than weavers. It manufactures spinning wheels and lends them to female spinners, lends cotton, and collects cloth and thread. The organization of transportation is that the cooperative collects cotton from various villages in Lingxi to pay public grain on behalf of them. The transportation team transports grain to the warehouse and transports cotton back to the cooperative in Lingxi.

Combination of Production and War Service

The rear service of the self-defense war is becoming more and more burdensome with the intensification of the war. Shi Zhenming created a method of combining war service and production. The full laborers are organized into field stretcher teams, the stronger semi-laborers are organized into ordinary stretcher teams and transportation teams, and the weaker semi-laborers are organized into preferential support assault teams. Whatever task comes, whatever labor force is used. In addition, difference tickets are printed, which are controlled by the village civil affairs director (because supporting the labor is a village-wide task). Support tasks are predetermined to be a certain number of points. Transporting public grain, four dou per load, is worth ten points, and those who carry more loads receive a proportional increase. Transporting fifty hand grenades is worth ten points, and transporting seventy-five is worth fifteen points. A stretcher, whether carried by four, three, or two people, is worth forty points, as long as the task is guaranteed to be completed. As a result, everyone voluntarily goes to support the labor. In the mutual aid group, a full laborer earns a maximum of ten points a day. Those who support the labor and carry more loads earn more points, greatly improving the efficiency of supporting the labor. Their method of assigning labor is that the village office assigns labor according to the labor roster. Supporting the labor is based on volunteering. Three people who can carry a load can support the labor for a task requiring five people, saving two laborers for labor in the group. After obtaining the difference ticket, multiply the number of days of supporting the labor by the points that should be earned to get the difference ticket that should be earned. The village office settles accounts every three months. The difference ticket itself has no price. The village office only uses it to calculate the number of points for supporting the labor, but it can be freely exchanged for work tickets within the group at a rate of one point for one point, without any surcharge. To take care of the emotions of those supporting the labor, the village decided that those with difference tickets have priority in allocating work. Militiamen participating in the war earn ten points a day and have priority in allocating work, which can offset the difference or be exchanged for wages.

To ensure that transportation does not interfere with participation in the war, half of the people are organized into transportation teams, and the other half do agricultural labor at home to prepare for supporting the labor. Moreover, supporting the labor and transportation are done in rotation, so that the work is evenly distributed. Transporters do not get work tickets but eat everyone's food, and everyone shares the dividends equally. Carrying sixty jin is the standard, and the excess fare belongs to the carrier himself. Those who support the labor eat their own food, and the difference tickets earned also belong to the whole group.

The five villages in Lingdong are mostly mountainous and have many cattle raisers, and most of them are relatively wealthy. Poorer households raise more donkeys (for transportation). Those with cattle do not have carts, and the cattle cannot carry loads. All the supporting labor is done by donkeys, which is unfair. The number of people buying donkeys is increasing, and after mass deliberation, it was decided that cattle and donkeys should both support the labor. When the donkey goes out to support the labor, the cattle plow the land at home. A donkey carrying eight dou a day is worth twenty points, and a cow plowing one mu of land is worth ten points. Later, it was changed to a donkey carrying five dou for one work point, and a cow plowing one mu and four fen of land for one work point.

Last year, participation in the war was frequent, and too much labor was used, which affected the preferential support work. The weaker semi-laborers were reorganized into preferential support brigades, each with one team and one team leader. The lower semi-laborers do not support the labor but are solely responsible for the preferential support. During the busy farming season, when the strength is insufficient, a women's preferential support assault brigade is temporarily organized.

In Tuling, the labor hero Duan Tingfang organized an autumn harvest brigade. In addition to the full laborers, children and women all participated, first harvesting for the families of those resisting the enemy, then for the families of those participating in the war, and then for the members themselves.

In addition to making military shoes, military pants, military quilts, and dismantling and washing old military uniforms, women spun three thousand six hundred jin of military cotton. During the autumn storage and transportation of public grain, women participated in transporting grain within fifty li, and some carried five dou of grain on their backs and climbed mountains at midnight. When large groups of porters passed through, the village set up reception stations and burned a large amount of firewood, all of which was brought by the women. They washed clothes and cooked for the wounded, and they rushed to grind flour when the army passed through. A large part of the labor force went to participate in the war, and the women rushed to harvest the autumn crops.

Shi Zhenming has achieved the combination of war service and production in his war service work, with strict organization, precise calculation, improved efficiency in supporting labor, and no waste of public resources.

Shi Zhenming's Leadership Method

Shi Zhenming said: "Mutual aid cannot be developed without cultivating new heroes." His cultivation method is to first select the target, find active elements discovered in the land reform of the search and work, and after the village cadres study, they are determined as the training object. After the object is determined, ideological education is carried out first to clarify his mass viewpoint and teach him how to serve the masses. Based on his two years of experience, Shi Zhenming often cautions new heroes not to be arrogant and conceited, to accept the opinions of the masses, and not to be selfish and self-interested. Secondly, do not do everything for them, but try to give full play to the wisdom of the new hero. When encountering difficult problems, he would conduct individual research with them. The old hero does not come forward, focusing on establishing the prestige of the new hero so that the masses can believe in him.

Shi Zhenming used this method of cultivating heroes with heroes and promoting typical cases with typical cases to cultivate ten heroes such as Qi Jingfu and Zhang Shihai. Qi Jingfu then cultivated Ge Wenchang, An Zhenshan cultivated Zhang Guoxiang, Huang Ying cultivated Zhao Meiying, and Zhao Meiying cultivated Li Fenghua and Liu Fengying.

Shi Zhenming served as the captain of the joint brigade of five villages. The first thing in leading the joint brigade was to exchange experiences in a timely manner. The meeting address was the Saiyi Grand Market in the center of the five villages. Everyone exchanged and summarized experiences during the market day. The second was that the five villages influenced and promoted each other. Each village was afraid of falling behind, and the work developed very rapidly in the competition. The third was that the people and livestock of the five villages were adjusted to each other when necessary.

　　太岳区的吴满有
    劳动英雄石振明
    边府建设厅整理
    石振明的材料很完整，因篇幅关系，我们只能介绍他的突出部分：农副业结合、战勤与生产结合、及领导上的突出点，以供各地今年开展大生产运动的参考。
    石振明是太岳区的吴满有
    老英雄石振明今年六十四岁，早年做过十六年的瓦窑工人，民国九年因灾荒袭击，从老家河南林县逃难到冀氏花豹沟做佃户，被地主逼返林县，回去仍然生活不下去，又被迫到孔制石板沟（冀氏属）做佃户，地主李昌九要夺地，虽经摆了酒席央人说合，结果仍然是被赶走，且将铁制犁耙扣下，积下的肥被扔到沁河里。
    民国廿九年，才搬到现在的浮山县范村西木公山，租了一片荒坡，借到一头小驴，晚上月亮底下犁地，白天开荒，头一年收粗粮二十石，交租十石，给中央军交负担还债用去七石，全家只剩下三石粗粮，饥寒一直威迫着他。
    卅年五月间，八路军决死队（薄一波同志领导的山西新军）到了浮山。共产党和抗日政府发布了减租减息号召，并宣布减免负担一年，新开荒地五年不出租不负担，老石算是松了一口气。卅一年新开荒二十五亩，共产粮三十石。卅二年岳南开展了深入的减租减息运动，石振明从重租剥削下获得解放。三十三年他首先组织了十八个全劳力的互助组，全范村共二十一个互助组（秋收时垮的只留下石振明的一个），他在三年内增开荒地六十五亩，共种地一百二十亩，收粮九十七石，养牛六头，驴一头，羊八十只，雇牛工羊工各一人，长工一人。
    三十三年春被选为浮山县劳动英雄，年底又被选为全太岳区劳动英雄，直到现在，他发展了五个行政村的联合大队，建立了一个为群众服务的混合业务合作社，创办了民办小学，创造了战勤和生产结合的范例，真正体现了毛主席提倡的典型推动一般领导骨干与群众结合的领导方法，培养了大批新英雄，形成大家公认的太岳区的吴满有，成为发展新式富农经济的方向。
    石振明互助大队的组织规模
    民国三十四年石振明互助组发展成互助大队，共四十八组，男劳力二百十四人，女劳力八十一人。三十五年发展成为五村的联合大队，计包括九十一个自然村二百十三组，男组一百廿三个，女组九十个，男全劳力六百十四人，半劳力四百七十人，女全劳力七百廿五人，半劳力二百七十七人，儿童一百五十七人，雇工九十人，牛羊工八十六人，残废四十七人，木匠十一人，共二千四百八十九人。
    纺织组增至一百十九个，纺妇一千零五十三人，畜力三百六十九犋，计七百三十八头。
    农业互助的计工折工办法
    所以如此巩固与发展，等价政策的实现是主要条件之一，对各种不同的劳动力做各种不同的生活，计工的基本原则是以劳力为主，技术为辅，成绩为标准的活定分，例如在农业上的变工是：男全劳力锄地担麦顶十分，半劳力扫场放磙也顶十分，妇女撇玉茭割谷也顶十分，儿童帮耧采籽顶五分，担粪开荒全劳力顶十分，半劳力顶七分八分不等，结合的计工折工办法是：副业及农业劳动与妇女缝纫变工上，如作鞋一双顶六个工，作袜一双顶三个工，缝两条单裤顶一个工，布衫一件顶一个工，与纺织变工上，如织布二丈顶一工，弹花五斤顶一工，纺花四两顶一工，妇女看孩子，三个孩子看一天顶一工，一个孩子看三天顶一工，做饭九顿顶一工。人畜变工则是连牛算人细犁一亩顶一工，秋茬地犁一亩半顶二亩，麦茬犁二亩顶一工，耦地七亩顶一工。
    其次放牛小工，清晨小放牛去地里做活顶工二分，早饭后放牛时又将四人组织为两班，二人放、二人参加互助，给谁干活吃谁的饭，牛工多挣钱，牛主省粮食，放牛时间还可以割柴拾粪，割一百廿斤顶十分工，拾粪一百廿斤顶十分工，雇工参加互助组的余工归雇工所有。残废者与儿童变工，小商人逢集赶集，背集参加互助，专会做鞋与专会纺花的组织换工，不会纺织的妇女给会纺织的做饭看孩子变工，六十多岁不能作重活的老头参加纺织组，拐线一斤顶一工，搓花三斤顶一工，木匠给互助组作工，互助组给木匠种地，木匠一工五升米，农业劳动一工三升米。运输给纺织组捎买花六十斤顶一工，运输与农业劳动结合是以组为单位，运输者吃共伙的，所得工票四六分红（运输者六在家者四）。
    合作社对农业互助组织无代价的印工票，供给农具，对纺织组则是供给原料，推销成品，自买洋袜机打袜子，给毛巾厂收线解决纺花者多，织布者少的困难。造出纺车贷给纺妇，贷花收布收线，对运输的组织是合作社，收岭西各村棉花代交公粮，运输队运粮交到仓库，到岭西给合作社运回棉花。
    生产与战勤相结合
    自卫战争的后方勤务，随着战争的激烈而愈益繁重，石振明即创造了战勤生产结合的办法，全劳力组织为野战担架队，较强的半劳力组织为普通担架队运输队，较弱的半劳力组织优抗突击队，什么任务到来，运用什么劳动力，另外印有差票，差票由村民政主任掌握（因为支差是全村性的工作）。支差任务都预定为一定的分数，运公粮每担四斗顶十分，多担者比例增加，运手掷弹每五十个顶十分，担七十五个顶十五分。担架一付不论四人三人或二人抬，一律顶四十分，只要保证任务的完成就行，这样执行结果，都自愿去支差。在互助组做活全劳力一天最高十分。支差多担，就多得分，大大的提高了支差效率。他们的派差办法，村公所根据派差簿该谁派谁，支差则根据自愿，五个人的差三个能担的人就可支了，节省二个劳力在组内劳动，取得差票后，按应顶的分数乘支差天数即得应得的差票。村公所每三月一次清算，差票本身没有价格，村公所只拿他作计算支差分数之用，但可在组内自由拿差票兑换工票，兑的办法仍是一分兑一分，不贴不扣，为了照顾支差人情绪，村里决定存有差票者有拨工优先权。民兵参战每天顶十分，有拨工优先权，可顶差亦可兑换工资。
    为了照顾运输不误参战，二分之一的人组织运输队，又二分之一的人在家做农业劳动，准备支差，而且是支差与运输轮流去作，做到甜苦均匀，运输者不得工票，吃大家的饭，大家平均分红，以担六十斤为标准，多担者所得脚价归担者本人独得，支差者吃自己饭，所得差票也归全组。
    岭东五村多山地，养牛者多，且多较富裕者，较贫户多养驴（为了运输），有牛无车，牛不会驮，支差全用驴，苦乐不均，买驴者日增，即经群众酝酿确定牛驴一律支差，驴出去支差，牛在家耕地，驴驮八斗一天顶二十分，牛犁地一亩顶十分，后又改为驴驮五斗顶一工，牛犁地一亩四分顶一工。
    去年参战频繁，使用劳力太多，影响了优抗工作，即重新组织较弱的半劳力为优抗大队，每设一分队，各设队长一人，下半劳力不支差，专负优抗责任，农忙季节，力量不敷应用，即临时组织妇女优抗突击大队。
    土岭则是由劳动英雄段廷芳组织了收秋大队，除全劳力外，儿童妇女都参加，先收抗属的，次收参战的，再次收队员自己的。
    妇女除作军鞋、军裤、军被、拆洗旧军衣外，纺军花三千六百斤，秋屯转运公粮时，五十里以内者妇女参加运粮，有背五斗粮食半夜里爬大山的，大挑民夫过境，村里设招待站，大量烧柴，全是妇女们打来的。给伤员洗衣作饭，大军过境突击磨面，大部劳动力去参战，妇女们突击秋收。
    石振明在战勤工作上做到了战争不误生产，组织严密，计算精确，支差效率提高，不浪费民力。
    石振明的领导方法
    石振明说：“不培养新英雄就不能发展互助”，他的培养方法，是首先选择对象，从查找工作土地改革中发现的积极分子，经过村干部研究后，确定为培养对象。对象确定后，首先进行思想教育，明确他的群众观点，教他怎样为群众服务，石振明根据他二年的经验中，他常告诫新英雄们不要自高自大，要接受群众意见，不要自私自利。其次是不包办不代替，尽量发挥新英雄的智谋，遇到难解决的问题和他个别研究，老英雄不出头，着重建立新英雄的威信，使群众相信他。
    石振明运用这套以英雄培养英雄，以典型推动典型的办法，培养了齐景福、张世海等十位英雄。齐景福又培养了葛文长，安振山培养了张国祥，黄英培养了赵梅英，赵梅英又培养了李凤华、刘凤英等。
    石振明自任五村联合大队的队长，对联合大队的领导第一是及时的交流经验。会议地址是五村中心的塞圪大市场，赶集时大家交换总结经验；第二是五村相互影响，相互推动，各村都怕落了后，经常在竞赛中，工作的发展非常迅速；第三是必要时五村人、畜力相互调剂。
