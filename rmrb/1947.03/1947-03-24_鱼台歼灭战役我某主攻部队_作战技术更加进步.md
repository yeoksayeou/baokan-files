    Our Main Attack Force in the Yutai Annihilation Campaign
    Has Made Further Progress in Combat Techniques
    [Report from the Jiluyu Front, March 21st] Our reporter Fang De reports: After our main attack force, which annihilated the 68th Regiment of Fang Xianjue's direct line troops in the Yutai outer perimeter annihilation battle, transferred to a certain location, I visited the soldiers' lives in this unit for two weeks and participated in two long marches. The soldiers were all in high spirits, calm, brave, and disciplined on the battlefield.
    Chiang's 5th Army from Shatuji and the 85th Division from Anxinji launched east-west offensives. On the evening of February 21st, the unit was ordered to block the enemy on the right flank. They rushed to the designated location and quickly constructed extremely solid fortifications. The next day, an attacking regiment of Chiang's troops concentrated firepower to fire at us. Their vanguard rapid force of about 60 cavalrymen advanced to about 60 meters from our fortifications. Our soldiers did not fire a single shot. Seeing our composure, the attacking enemy fled in panic. In the evening, the unit made another 80-li long march. No one complained, and no one fell behind.
    The unit has also made leaps and bounds in mastering techniques. The high learning enthusiasm in the team prompted everyone and every unit to not want to lag behind. As soon as the Yangzhuang battle ended, the 6th Company, which had been the main attack force and fought bitterly for two days, began to study the captured Japanese-made Type 92 machine guns intensively. The machine gun instructor was a soldier who had just been liberated from the Yangzhuang battle. Skilled machine gunners are constantly emerging, and some are even more skilled than the best old marksmen before the Yangzhuang battle. For example, Deputy Squad Leader Li Jiu can disassemble the machine gun completely in ten minutes with his eyes closed. On March 2nd, I visited the unit's attack drill. From 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, the soldiers quickly built defensive fortifications as solid as those of Chiang's army. Under the cover of light and heavy weapons, the assault troops launched an attack, rushing through obstacles in the rising smoke, and successfully climbed onto the roof in five minutes without any tools for combat.
    What impressed me strongly was also the unit's mass discipline and political leaps. When the soldiers borrowed materials from the masses during the construction of fortifications, they first wrote down in chalk who it belonged to and which class borrowed it. As soon as the exercise was over, it was immediately dismantled and returned. During combat, in order to prevent the unit from suddenly transferring and not having time to dismantle and return everything, the masses were led to the fortifications in advance to explain clearly. I happened to visit the 7th Company, and the soldiers were holding a discipline review meeting. New soldiers Wang Cheng and Luo Shaowen, who had just been liberated from the Yangzhuang battle, also enthusiastically participated in the discussion like the old soldiers, and they firmly stated at the meeting that they would learn from the spirit of the old comrades to abide by discipline and serve the people.

    鱼台歼灭战役我某主攻部队
    作战技术更加进步
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十一日电】本报记者方德报道：鱼台外围歼灭蒋介石嫡系方先觉部六十八团之我主攻部队转进至某地后，记者曾赴该部队参观战士生活，历时两周，并参加两次长途行军。战士们精神均极为饱满，在作战中无不沉着勇敢与遵守战场纪律。
    蒋军五军自沙土集，八十五师自安新集东西进攻。二月二十一日晚，该部奉命于右翼阻击，即奔赴预定地点，迅速构筑极坚实之工事。次日，进犯蒋军一个团集中火力向我射击，其先头快速部队骑兵约六十余人已进至距工事约六十米处，我战士仍一枪未发。进犯之敌见我如此沉着，即仓惶逃避。晚间，该部复作八十里长途行军，途中没有一个人说二话，也没有一个人掉队。
    该部在技术掌握上也有飞跃进步。队中高涨的学习热情，促使每个人每个单位都不愿落后。杨庄战斗一结束，担任主攻苦战两日之六连即开始紧张学习缴获的日造九二式机枪，教机枪的就是刚由杨庄战斗中解放过来的战士。熟练的机枪手不断涌现，并且有的熟练程度也超过杨庄战斗前，技术最好的老射手。如副班长李九就能够蒙着眼睛，在十分钟内把机枪拆卸完毕。三月二日，参观该部进攻演习。战士们由晨八至十时，就神速地筑好了和蒋军的同样坚固的防御工事。突击部队在轻重火器掩护下，举行进攻，在轰起的浓烟中，冲过障碍，不假任何工具，就顺利地在五分钟内攀登上屋，进行作战。
    给记者强烈印象的还有该部群众纪律和政治上的飞跃进步。战士于构筑工事时借用群众的器材上，都先用粉笔写好谁家的，几班借的。演习一完，立刻拆除送还。作战时，为防止部队突然转移，来不及一一拆卸送还，事先就领群众至工事处交代明白。记者偶至七连，战士们正开检讨纪律会议。杨庄之战才解放过来不久的新战士王成和罗少文，也和老战士一样，热烈参加讨论，他们并在会上坚决表示：要向老同志学习遵守纪律为人民服务的精神。
