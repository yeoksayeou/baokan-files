    Villages Along the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border West of the River
    Organize Joint Defense Armed Forces to Distribute Land
    [This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch of the 23rd] Joint defense land distribution is being widely carried out in the western border area of Hebei, Shandong and Henan. The western fifth district is very close to the Jiang-occupied area of Changqing, and special agents are often active. Initially, the cadres could not understand the idea of holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other. Before the Lunar New Year, the approach was to first counter special agents and then distribute land, focusing only on developing armed forces, organizing joint defense, repairing walled villages, and blocking alleyways. However, after the special agents broke through one opening, the morale of the masses declined, and the cadres were at a loss. Later, the leadership made a self-criticism, believing that the policy of "first counter special agents, then distribute land" was wrong. It was decided to change the policy and convene a meeting of more than 200 activists from fifteen villages in the west. A district headquarters was organized, mainly using the district armed forces, with the county armed forces cooperating to organize joint defense and protect land distribution. After the activists returned to their villages, they universally convened village meetings and grievance meetings to carry out land distribution. The morale of the masses was extremely high. A member of the peasant association in Liuzhuang said, "Even if I am killed tomorrow, I must get some land to cultivate today."

    冀鲁豫河西边沿村
    组织联防武装分田
    【本报冀鲁豫廿三日电】河西边沿区普遍展开联防分田。河西五区离长清蒋占区很近，特务时常活动，干部对一手持枪一手分田的思想起初打不通，在旧历年前进行的是先反特、后分田，只是发展武装、组织联防、修围寨、堵巷口；但被特务突破了一个口子后，群众情绪低落，干部也没了办法。后来领导上做了检讨，认为先反特后分田的方针是错误的，决定转变方针，召开西部十五个村二百多人的积极分子大会；并组织区指挥部，以区武装为主，县武装配合组织联防，掩护分田。积极分子回村后、普遍召开村民大会、诉苦大会，进行分田、群众情绪极为高涨。刘庄有一位农会员说：“到明天打死我，今天我也得要点地种种。”
