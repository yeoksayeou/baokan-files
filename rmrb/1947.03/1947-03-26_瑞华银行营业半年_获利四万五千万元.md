Ruihua Bank Profits 450 Million Yuan in Half a Year of Operation

[Reported by this newspaper] The privately-owned Ruihua Bank held its second shareholders' meeting in its resident location on March 10th. Due to the impact of the war, not all shareholders from various locations were able to attend; many sent letters of explanation or entrusted representatives to participate. Thirty-two shareholder representatives from Xingtai, Jining, Heze, Changzhi, Handan, Wu'an and other places attended. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Hu Zhuxuan reported on the bank's operations for the past six months. This year, with the support of the government, the help of fellow banks, and the efforts of all staff, the bank achieved a net profit of 455 million yuan (approximately equivalent to 455 million yuan in Chiang currency). In the past six months, prices in this region have risen by 59%, and gold has risen by 57%. In addition to guaranteeing tangible capital and gold capital, the bank has a surplus of 50% to 60%. After Inspector Zhang Ziyuan reported, the meeting entered into discussion. Shareholder representatives unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the active work of Chairman Hu and all directors, supervisors, and staff; and approved the methods for surplus distribution and the exchange of whole and fractional shares for dividends. They especially praised the directors, supervisors, and staff for voluntarily reducing their bonuses by 80% (amounting to over 18.2 million yuan). All shareholder representatives also agreed to contribute 50% of the public welfare fund (amounting to 4.5 million yuan) to support the front lines, and all directors, supervisors, and staff also voluntarily donated 50% of their bonuses, totaling 4.5 million yuan, to the front lines. The two donations totaled 9 million yuan, and they paid tribute to the front lines in the name of all shareholders and staff.
