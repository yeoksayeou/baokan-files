　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 15th Dispatch】Peasants in various parts of the Jin-Sui Border Region have universally exposed the conspiracies of landlords to sabotage land reform. Wu Yunwei, a landlord from Caijia Village in Jingle, divided his land among his younger brothers during the rent reduction in 1941, disguising himself as a middle peasant. He infiltrated the democratic government, serving as a grain and fodder committee member, stealing public grain, beating and exploiting villagers, and ultimately causing the death of Cao Maju. Li Zhengqing, a landlord from Baoshangtou Village, pretended to be progressive in order to paralyze the cadres. During the rent reduction and debt settlement in 1942, he "forgave" old debts that had already been repaid several times over in interest. He also pretended to be active in supporting the army and government. Because he had been "enlightened," he was elected as a county councilor. After obtaining this position, he took advantage of low prices to purchase 223 mu of good land and continued to exploit peasants through usury. Zhang Er's 24 mu of land were completely taken away by him through high-interest loans, leaving his entire family unable to make a living. Fan Errang, a landlord from Baini Yao Village in Pian Guan, bribed tenant farmers. The first time, he pretended to donate land to avoid struggle, and the second time, he pretended to settle accounts and return property to the tenant farmers, but then took it back afterward. Landlords in Lin County and other places used their daughters to marry cadres or used their daughters-in-law, younger brothers' wives, and wives to seduce cadres, bribing and dividing them with money, grain, and land, so that cadres would become detached from the masses. Currently, various localities are deeply mobilizing the masses to correct the work style of cadres who use coercion and command and become detached from the masses, strengthening the political education of cadres and the masses, exposing the destructive conspiracies of the landlords, and clearing away obstacles to the realization of "land to the tiller."

　　晋绥各地群运中普遍揭发地主阴谋
    【新华社晋绥十五日电】晋绥边区各地农民，普遍揭发地主破坏土地改革阴谋。静乐蔡家庄地主武云维，在四一年减租时，将土地分与其弟，自己伪装中农，混入民主政权任粮秣委员，偷盗公粮，吊打剥削村民，并将曹马驹害死。保上头村地主李正清，伪装进步以麻痹干部。在四二年减租清债时，将已收利数倍的旧债“免除”；劳军拥政时，也假装积极，因曾“开明”，被选为县参议员，彼于窃得地位后，即乘低价购进二百二十三亩好地，继续高利盘剥农民。贫农张二二十四亩地全被他用高利贷夺去，弄得全家无法生活。偏关白泥窑村地主范二让，收买佃户，第一次假装献地来逃避斗争，第二次又假清算退还佃户财物，事后又收回。临县等地地主，以其女儿嫁给干部或以儿媳、弟妇、老婆引诱干部，用金钱粮食土地贿赂分化，以使干部与群众脱节。现在各地深入发动群众纠正干部强迫命令脱离群众的作风，加强了干部与群众的政治教育，揭破了地主的破坏阴谋，扫除了实现耕者有其田障碍。
