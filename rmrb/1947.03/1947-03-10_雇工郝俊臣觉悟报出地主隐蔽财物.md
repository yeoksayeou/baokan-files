(This dispatch from the Jinnan Bureau reports from Weixian on the 8th) Hired laborers in Wangxiaohe Village, Weixian County, reported the hidden property of landlords after awakening during rent reduction. Hao Junchen, a hired laborer in the village, had always "worked for" the landlord. During this movement, after cadres painstakingly persuaded him, starting with the hardship of his lifetime of labor, they enlightened him by asking if he intended to keep working until he was old. He awakened and reported that he had hidden more than 500 jin of wheat, more than 100 jin of beans, and other packages of clothing for the landlord. Influenced by him, Wang Changyi and two others, as well as a village cadre, reported the property they had hidden for the landlord. The village peasant association immediately absorbed him as a member.

　　雇工郝俊臣觉悟报出地主隐蔽财物
    【本报冀南八日电】威县王小河查减中雇工经觉悟后报出地主隐藏财物。该村雇工郝俊臣，一向给地主“走里”，此次运动中，经干部苦口劝说：从他扛活一辈子的苦诉起，启发他是不是还打算一直扛到老？他觉悟了，报出给地主藏的麦子五百多斤，豆子一百多斤及其他包袱衣物等。在他的影响下，有王昌毅等二人及一村干，报出给地主隐藏的财物；村农会并马上吸收他做会员。
