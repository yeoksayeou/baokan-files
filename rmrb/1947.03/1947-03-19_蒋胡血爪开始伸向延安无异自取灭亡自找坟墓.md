　　Jiang Jieshi's offensive against Yan'an officially began on the 13th. This is Jiang Jieshi's desperate military gamble and a step towards accelerating his self-destruction.

　　The one executing Jiang Jieshi's task of attacking Yan'an is Jiang Jieshi's running dog, Hu Zongnan. This is a conspirator who has only ever lost battles in his life. The reason he is so heavily relied upon by Jiang Jieshi is not because he is good at fighting, but because he is willing to be Jiang Jieshi's running dog. This ever-defeated general, relying on Jiang Jieshi's trust, wantonly tramples on the people of the Northwest, becoming the public enemy of the people of the Northwest. His attack on Yan'an this time provides the people of the Northwest with the best opportunity to thoroughly settle accounts with Hu Zongnan.

　　The main force of Jiang Hu's offensive against Yan'an is east of Luochuan and west of the Yellow River. Those gathered at the Luochuan-Yichuan line are Hu Zongnan's main force, totaling about ten brigades including the First Division; west of the Luo River are his flanking troops, about five brigades. On the 13th, his main attacking troops launched first, attacking in two routes. One route started west from Yichuan, with the target being Jinpenwan and Nanniwan in the southeast direction of Yan'an; the other route went straight from Luochuan to ＠县, with the target being to go to Yan'an via Ganquan along the official route. Simultaneously with the full-scale offensive on the 13th, Jiang Hu began a brutal and inhumane bombing of Yan'an, bombing continuously for eight hours on the 13th and seven hours on the 14th. At the same time, airplanes were dispatched daily to universally bomb and strafe all counties in the border region. Such bombing was only done by Japanese imperialists against the Chinese people in the past. Jiang Jieshi's hatred for the Chinese people has reached such a degree, indicating that he is a thorough big traitor.

　　The Yan'an defense war has just begun, and Hu Zongnan's offensive has been going on for half a week, but on the road to Lintong, they have only advanced more than ten *li* in two days; on the ＠Gan Avenue, they have only advanced to the vicinity of Yulin Bridge, sixty *li* south of Ganquan.

　　Jiang Jieshi publicly spoke at the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Nanjing on the 15th, wanting to "destroy" the CCP's power. At that time, the report he received was the beginning of the invasion of Yan'an and the brutal bombing of Yan'an, which he thought was very satisfactory. However, the death knell on other battlefields was hammering his head again. First of all, in the Northeast, in late February, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army automatically moved north in the Jilin-Changchun area, and Du Yuming boasted greatly, declaring victory; Jiang Jieshi was so happy that he issued not only commendation orders but also medals. However, at the beginning of this month, the Democratic Allied Army only added a little counterattack, and the 71st Army, one of Jiang Jieshi's main forces in the Northeast, wiped out an entire 88th Division northwest of Dehui on the 9th and 10th in one fell swoop, and even defeated the 87th Division and the army's directly subordinate units. Du Yuming repeatedly said, "I am not good at propaganda," but what should be done with the medals that Jiang Jieshi had just issued!

　　The Shandong battlefield is also not going smoothly for Jiang Jieshi. After the Jiang army's disastrous defeat on the 24th of last month, Jiang Jieshi personally went to Jinan to "see off" the Seventh Division, but the Shandong war situation did not change because of Jiang Jieshi's farewell. On the Jinpu Railway, the Jiang army gathered troops from southern Shandong, western Shandong, and along the Jinpu line to try to go north to Jinan, but so far has not been able to pass Xiexian, while Qufu behind has already been recovered by the people once. On the Jiaoji Railway, more than ten important towns such as Zhoucun, Zhangdian, and Yidu are still in the hands of the people, and key areas such as Gaomi, Jiaoxian, and ＠shan in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway and more than two hundred *li* of railway line have been successively liberated by the people, and Weixian has become an isolated city. Chen Cheng flew to Jiaoxian on the 2nd of this month to cheer for the isolated and defeated Jiang family's Eighth Army, perhaps he should go again now. But what magic trick can this "Chief of Staff Headquarters" who personally directed the battle situation in central and southern Shandong and sent off the Seventh Division have!

### 蒋胡血爪开始伸向延安无异自取灭亡自找坟墓

　　蒋胡血爪开始伸向延安无异自取灭亡自找坟墓
    蒋介石对延安的进攻战，于十三日正式开始了，这是蒋介石绝望的军事冒险，是蒋介石加速其自取灭亡的步骤。
    执行蒋介石进攻延安任务的是蒋介石的走狗胡宗南，这是一生只会打败仗的阴谋家，他在蒋介石下面之所以如此被重用，不是因为他会打仗，而是因为他甘心作蒋介石的走狗。这位常败将军凭借蒋介石的信任，肆无忌惮的蹂躏西北人民，成为西北人民之公敌。他这次进攻延安，正给西北人民以向胡宗南彻底清算的最好机会。
    蒋胡对延安的进攻主力，系在洛川以东，黄河以西。其集结于洛川、宜川”线者，为胡宗南之主力，计第一师等约十个旅；洛河以西为其侧翼部队，约五个旅。十三日，其主攻部队先行发动，分两路进攻，一路由宜川西出发，攻击目标在延安东南方向的金盆湾、南泥湾；另一路则由洛川直趋＠县，目标在循公路线经甘泉趋延安。十三日全面进攻的同时，蒋胡对延安开始毫无人性的大轰炸，十三日连炸八小时，十四日连炸七小时。同时，对所有边区各县每日派飞机普遍轰炸与扫射。这样的轰炸，过去只有日本帝国主义者对付中国人民才这样干过，蒋介石与中国人民为仇到了这样程度，说明他是十十足足的大汉奸。
    延安保卫战还刚开始，胡宗南进攻已半周，而在临镇一路，两天不过前进十余里；＠甘大道上也不过前进到甘泉南六十里之榆林桥附近。
    蒋介石十五日在南京国民党三中全会上公开演说，要“摧毁”中共力量。他那时所得的报告是进犯延安的开始与对延安的残酷大轰炸，自以为很得意。但是，另外战场上的丧钟又捶得他脑袋发痛。首先是东北，二月下旬，东北民主联军于吉长地区自动向北运动，杜聿明就大吹法螺，自表胜利；蒋介石喜的既下奖令，又颁奖章。但是，本月初民主联军只稍加回击，蒋介石在东北有数的主力之一的七十一军，就在九、十两日一举在德惠西北消灭了整整一个八十八师，连八十七师和该军军直属队也打垮了。杜聿明再三的说“我不善于宣传之道”，但蒋介石刚发下去的奖章又怎么办呢！
    山东战场对蒋介石也不顺利。上月二十四日，蒋军芜大败之后，蒋介石曾亲往济南送七师人之“终”，但山东战局并没有因蒋介石的送终而有所改变。津浦路方面，蒋军集结鲁南、鲁西及津浦沿线之部队图北上济南，但至今未能过西安，而后面的曲阜却已被人民一度收复了。胶济路方面，不出周村、张店、益都等十余重要城镇仍在人民手中，而胶济路东段之高密、胶县、＠山等要地及东西二百余里之铁路线，又先后被人民解放，潍县成为一座孤城。陈诚本月二日曾飞胶县与孤立的而且是残败的蒋家第八军打气，也许现在又该去一趟了。但是这位亲自指挥鲁中鲁南战局、奉送了七师的“参谋总部”，他能有什么妙法呢！
