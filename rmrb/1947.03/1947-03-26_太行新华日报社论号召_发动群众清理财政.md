Taixing Xinhua Daily Editorial Calls for Mobilizing the Masses to Clean Up Finances
[Report from our newspaper in Taixing, 24th] The Taixing Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial entitled "New Directions for Rectifying and Resolving Local Finances," calling on the entire region to launch a mass campaign to investigate long-term unattended stockpiled materials in order to reduce the people's burden and enhance the material and financial resources for self-defense. After the masses were emancipated, they developed a sense of ownership, creating the conditions for this work. We should break away from the past practice of only having financial and grain cadres conduct rectification and investigation, and thoroughly investigate in conjunction with the masses. At the same time, we should promote the experience of Heshun, Xiangyuan, and Lucheng in investing a portion of local grain funds in production and construction, so that local finance moves towards self-sufficiency, taking less or nothing from the people. We should also promote the spirit of Xiangyuan and other counties in the Second Special District, which overcame departmentalism in the process of rectification, took care of the overall situation, and supported the border region and the front lines with the proceeds from rectification. We must thoroughly eliminate the phenomena of indiscriminate collection and spending, arbitrary borrowing, or soliciting donations from the masses for the construction of institutions. Grain and funds that were borrowed and used indiscriminately in the past should be immediately cleared and handed over to the public. The border region's and local finances should be strictly separated. In the past, individual regions reported losses and arrears of border grain and funds, or failed to report grain donated by the masses and included it in local accounts, etc., which were manifestations of departmentalism; if such phenomena occur again after rectification, they should be severely punished. Those who invest in commercial operations should also be criticized.

    太行新华日报社论号召
    发动群众清理财政
    【本报太行二十四日电】太行新华日报顷以“整顿与解决地方财政的新方向”为题发表社论，号召全区来一次群众性的清查存放多年无人过问的埋伏物资，以减轻人民负担与增强自卫的物力财力。群众翻身后有了主人翁思想，创造了这一工作的条件。应打破过去仅是财粮干部整顿清查的办法，结合群众彻底清查。同时发扬和顺、襄垣、潞城以地方粮款一部投资生产建设事业，使地方财政走向自给，不取之于民或少取之于民的经验。并发扬二专区襄垣等县，在整顿中克服了本位主义，照顾全局，以整顿所得支援边区、支援前线的精神。彻底革除滥收滥支、随意拉借，或为了机关建设向群众募捐现象。过去如有乱借乱用的粮款应即清理交公。边、地财政应严格分清，过去个别地区有汇报边粮边款损失与尾欠，或群众献粮不报，归入地方等本位主义现象；整顿后如再发生应予严办。投资经营商业者亦应受到批评。
