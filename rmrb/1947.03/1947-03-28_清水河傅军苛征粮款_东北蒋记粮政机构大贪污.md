    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 18th: After Fu Jun reoccupied Qingshui River, he harshly levied grain requisitions. Last year, the 40,000 people of the county were forced to borrow 13,000 shi of wheat as provincial, county, township, and bao public grain, equivalent to 22,000 large shi of mixed grains, and bear public funds of 1.26 million yuan. This county is a poor area in southern Suiyuan, and grain is already severely scarce. However, Fu’s die-hard security team and county government personnel still rotate in sending food to the residents of the urban area every day, and the people's lives have fallen into a tragic plight.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: Changchun news: A major embezzlement case recently occurred in the grain administration agencies of the Kuomintang in Northeast China. The main perpetrators of the embezzlement are Lin Sixian, Director of the Second District Grain Administration Bureau of the Kuomintang in Northeast China, and Lin Huaide and Shi, Deputy Directors of the Bureau, as well as warehouse directors Jia Shaolin, Lin Longfei, Liu Bin, and Li Zhesen. The amount of embezzlement is more than 100 million Northeast circulating notes (one yuan is equivalent to 13 yuan of KMT legal tender). This huge sum of embezzled money was obtained by forcibly suppressing prices and extorting the people under the pretext of collecting public grain.

    清水河傅军苛征粮款
    东北蒋记粮政机构大贪污
    【新华社晋绥十八日电】傅军重占清水河后，苛征粮款，去年全县四万人民即征借省县乡保公粮一万三千石小麦，合杂粮二万二千大石，并负担公款一百二十六万元。该县本为绥南贫瘠县份，粮食已感严重困难，但傅顽保安队及县府人员每日仍向城关居民轮流派饭，人民生活已陷入悲惨绝境。
    【新华社东北二十五日电】长春消息：东北国民党粮政机构中近发生一大贪污案，贪污主角为国民党东北第二区粮食管理局局长林斯贤及该局副局长林怀德、石等和仓库主任贾绍麟、林龙飞、刘斌、李哲森等人。贪污数额在东北流通券（一元合国民党法币十三元）一亿以上，此项贪污巨款，系借搜括公粮机会，强制压低价格苛勒百姓所得。
