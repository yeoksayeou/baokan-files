What are we "Swearing to Always Abide By"?
A Juxtaposition of the Pseudo-Constitution and Real Events, Part 1
Dongfang Man

Chiang's pseudo-constitution, with its one hundred and seventy-five articles, is clearly like an old, smelly, and lengthy bound foot of an old woman, yet it insists on embroidering "democracy," "freedom," "autonomy," and "equality" flowers on it, waving them before people's eyes and wrapping them around their necks, to dazzle you and prevent you from smelling its stench. Simply listing the articles can be misleading; reading them in reverse can also be tiresome. In fact, by simply using its own words and comparing them with commonly known facts, its falsity becomes self-evident, requiring no further explanation. Take its opening statement, for example:

"The National Assembly of the Republic of China, entrusted by all the people, based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on the founding of the Republic of China, in order to consolidate national power, protect civil rights, establish social stability, and enhance the welfare of the people, hereby enacts and promulgates this Constitution to be followed by the entire nation forever."

What "all the people" and "Sun Yat-sen's teachings"—the common people have heard these ghost stories for eighteen or nineteen years and already understand them as lies, so there is no need for comparison. Only by comparing the latter four constitutional objectives with the major events that occurred around November 25th of last year can we discover that this is indeed an extremely satirical set of general principles. Let us list them as follows:

"Consolidate National Power" outline:

	First item: The Chiang-American Commercial Treaty, wholesaling and retailing all national rights, is signed. Second item: Still feeling that not enough has been sold to "consolidate," the "Chiang-American Aviation Agreement" is signed. Third item: American soldiers rape female student Shen Chong on the streets of Beiping. Fourth item: The U.S. military decides to garrison Qingdao long-term. Fifth item, sixth item...too numerous to list.

"Protect Civil Rights" outline:

	First item: Thousands of Shanghai peddlers are driven, beaten, and imprisoned by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Second item: Zhu Xuefan, fleeing to Hong Kong, is assassinated. Third item: Chongqing students are beaten for patriotic propaganda. Fourth item: Liang Renda, promoting the use of domestic goods, is killed. Fifth item: Xinhua Daily, The Masses magazine, Democratic Daily… are investigated, sealed, and forced to shut down…

"Establish Social Stability" outline:

	First item: Mobilizing two hundred divisions to attack the Liberated Areas. Second item: Forced conscription and grain requisition, causing chaos in every household. Third item: Resistance of Yi people in Xikang, and civil uprisings in dozens of provinces involving hundreds of thousands of people. Fourth item: Releasing the Yellow River to flood seven million people…

"Enhance the Welfare of the People" outline:

	First item: Labor strikes are widespread, and wages are not allowed to rise based on the monthly index. Second item: Chiang Kai-shek personally instructs Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank, to stir up the gold rush. Third item: Prices soar two and a half times…

Chiang Kai-shek said at the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang: "We have truly never neglected our preparations for implementing constitutional government." We should really thank him for his loyalty to his American masters and the Four Great Families. Just these preparations for implementing constitutional government have sold out our people to the point where they are almost skin and bones. If constitutional government is truly implemented, he will even sell our ashes as fertilizer for America. Yet, he still wants us to "swear to always abide by" it!

    “赌咒永远大家照办”些什么
    伪宪真事对读录之一
    东方漫
    蒋造伪宪一百七十五条，明明是又臭又长的脏婆娘的裹脚布，却偏要在上面绣些“民主”、“自由”、“自治”、“平等”的花儿朵儿，幌在人的眼前，绕在人的脖上，叫你眼花缭乱、不闻其臭。专录条文，易被迷惑；一味反读，也感厌倦。其实就用他的词句，和人所共知的事实对照一读，也就其伪自明，简直连注解都用不着加的。譬如拿它开宗明义的冒头来说吧：
    “中华民国国民大会受全体国民之付托，依据孙中山先生创立中华民国之遗教，为巩固国权、保障民权、奠定社会安宁、增进人民福利，制定本宪法颁行全国、永矢咸遵。”
    什么“全体国民”、“中山遗教”，老百姓听了十八九年，早已懂得是鬼话，连对读也不必了。只拿后半四项制宪目的来比照一下去年十一月二十五日前后发生的大事，就发现这实在是极富刺讽意味的一套总纲。试列举如下：
  “巩固国权”纲：
    第一目：一切国权，整趸批卖的蒋美商约签字。第二目：尚嫌卖得不够“巩固”，又订《蒋美航空协定》。第三目：美兵在北平大街，强奸女生沈崇。第四目：美军决定长期囤驻青岛。第五目，第六目………不胜列举。
  “保障民权”纲：
    第一目：上海摊贩数千人为上海市政府驱打监禁。第二目：朱学范逃亡香港被刺。第三目：重庆学生因爱国宣传被打。第四目：梁仁达提倡爱用国货被杀。第五目：新华日报，群众杂志、民主报……被查封迫停。……
  “奠定社会安宁”纲：
    第一目：动员两百师，进攻解放区。第二目：抓丁征粮，鸡飞狗上墙。第三目：西康夷民抗战，各省数十万民变。第四目：放黄水淹七百万人。………
  “增进人民福利”纲：
    第一目：工潮遍地，工资以一月指数为准不得上升。第二目：蒋中正手谕中央银行总裁贝祖贻掀动黄金潮。第三目：物价陡涨二倍半。……
    蒋介石在国民党三中全会上说：“我们实在没有一天怠忽我们实行宪政的准备”。真该谢谢他对美国主子和四大家族的忠勤，单只这行宪的准备就把我们全国人民卖到剥得快成骨头架子了，真个行宪，可就连骨头灰也要让他卖把美国做肥田粉。就这，他还要我们“赌咒永远大家照办”（永矢咸遵）呢！
