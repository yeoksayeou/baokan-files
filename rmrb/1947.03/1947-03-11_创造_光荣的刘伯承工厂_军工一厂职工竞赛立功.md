　　Creating a "Glorious Liu Bocheng Factory"
    Workers of Military Industry Factory No. 1 Compete to Earn Merit
    [Our Dispatch] All the workers of Military Industry Office No. 1 Factory have launched a fervent production competition to strive for the title of "Glorious Liu Bocheng Factory." Various labor heroes are vying to increase the production of artillery shells to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, all with the enthusiasm of seizing the red flag in four or five years to win the competition. Some units in the factory were newly built and severely lacked personnel and equipment, but they actively challenged the iron smelting and sand casting production units. Workers successively formulated plans for increasing production and saving resources. After Factory Director Li announced the launch of a friendly competition with brother factories of the Military Industry Office, all the workers, even the coal kiln cooperative, were drawn into the competition wave. Bai Peitang, the second-ranked labor hero of the factory, said: He wants to establish greater merit in this movement. Wang Wuhai, a labor hero of the iron smelting department, wants to personally install ten iron smelting square furnaces during the competition, saving two-thirds of the manpower and ensuring the production of raw iron for sand casting; fitters and machinists are willing to add voluntary work hours. The daily average output of Bai Erhai and Bai Peitang has increased to over 160. The output of Dong Yaohai, a sand casting apprentice, has surged from 100 to 200. One red furnace plate could only be used by three groups in the past, but now it can be used by five groups. Coal kiln workers greatly increased production in the three-day competition. Gao Erchang of the sand casting department worked hard to improve the sand casting technology for large artillery shells, successfully doubling the previous output. In addition to his work, the timekeeper also went to the red furnace to strike the hammer for an hour. After the tense labor, the workers seized the time to study culture and technology. Hu Guangyun's machinist class automatically organized apprentices to study culture, and the relationship between master and apprentice was extremely good. Small blackboards have been set up in the installation department and woodworking groups. Groups such as the stewing furnace and sand casting groups bought their own paper and pens to improve their cultural and technical level.

　　创造“光荣的刘伯承工厂”
    军工一厂职工竞赛立功
    【本报讯】军工处第一厂全体职工为争劝光荣的刘伯承工厂”，展开了热烈的生产竞赛。各色劳动英雄，争着增产炮弹打垮蒋介石，均以四五年夺大红旗的热情来争取竞赛的胜利。该厂有部分单位新建不久，人员器材异常缺乏，也积极向冶铁翻沙各生产单位提出挑战，工人们纷纷订出增产节约计划。当李厂长宣布向军工处各兄弟厂展开友谊竞赛后，全体职工以至煤窑合作社，都卷入了竞赛浪潮。全厂第二名劳动英雄白培堂表示：要在这次运动中建立更大功劳。冶铁部劳英王五孩要在竞赛中亲自动手装冶铁大方炉十炉，节省人力三分之二，保证出的毛织供翻沙用；钳工机工均愿加义务工。白二孩、白培堂每日平均产量提高到一百六十以上。翻沙见习工匠董尧孩产量已由一百激增至二百。红炉一盘过去只能供三个组使用，现在可供五个组。煤窑工友在三天竞赛中产量大增，翻沙部高二长努力改进大炮弹翻沙技术成功，超过以往产量一倍，记工员除工作外，还到红炉打锤一小时。工人们于紧张劳动之后，抓紧文化技术学习，机工胡广云班自动组织徒弟学习文化，师徒关系极为良好。按装部及木工各组都建立起小黑板，焖炉翻沙等组自买纸笔提高文化技术水平。
