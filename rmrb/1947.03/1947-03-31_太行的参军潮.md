The liberated peasants of the Taihang Mountains, upon hearing the news of the Jiang-Hu army's attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, were filled with righteous indignation. They unanimously shouted, "Go to the front to defend Chairman Mao! Defend our land!" In just over ten days, tens of thousands of young people have surged onto the battlefield of the patriotic self-defense war.

This army recruitment movement was launched on the basis of ideological liberation. Liberated peasants, workers, merchants, and students throughout the region have all expressed their desire to go to the front lines to "defend Chairman Mao!" During a discussion on "Protecting Our Land and Fruits of Labor" in Neiqiu Chengguan, the elderly proposed working hard to increase production and wealth; the women proposed spinning, weaving, and carrying stretchers in the rear to care for the wounded and sick; and the young men all shouted, "We will go to the front lines to kill the enemy and protect you." Two hundred young people immediately signed up to join the army. In Madiao Village, Wuan, where only six families reside, four young men were mining coal when they heard from other workers that the Jiang-Hu army was attacking northern Shaanxi. The four of them ran home and immediately signed up for the army. Cao Shuanggui from Baisha Village, who was working in a coal mine, signed up for the army without even going home. Li Chengwen, an old man from Bei Wenzhang, had already sent two sons to join the army last year. This time, he sent his third son to the Eighth Route Army. He said to his third son, "Third son, in order to protect the good house we were allocated, you must also sign up for the army." Zhang Mi (female) from Hexi Village had just married Yang Shun from Wang'erzhuang. When Shun signed up for the army this time, Mi comforted her husband, saying, "You fight the stubborn enemy well at the front, and don't worry about home." She made two pairs of shoes and two pairs of socks overnight, ready to send Shun to the front lines. Before he left, she bought 500 yuan worth of eggs for Shun to take with him and gave him the 2,000 yuan from her wedding as travel expenses. Sang Yangbao, a military dependent from Dongxiao Village, Pingshun, personally sent his third son to the district. He said to the district chief, "Defending Chairman Mao is also defending ourselves. If we don't go to the front lines, who are we counting on?" Why is he able to do this? He said, "In 1920, I was so hungry that I couldn't bear it anymore, so I fled to Dongxiao Village to settle down. I asked someone to treat the landlord Xu Tingbi to rent five mu of land, but the grain I harvested was not even enough for his rent. When the Japanese devils came, I couldn't even get enough to eat begging. The whole family was preparing to flee when I happened to meet District Chief Wang, who came up with a solution for me—rent reduction. I united a few poor brothers and struggled against Xu Tingbi, and got back the five mu of land. I know that these good days were given to me by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I will never forget it. When fighting the Japanese, I sent two sons away; now the damned guys are attacking the place where Chairman Mao lives, in good conscience I cannot not send my youngest son to defend Chairman Mao."

Guo Jinzhong, a liberated old peasant from Suobao, She County, said when sending his son to join the army, "Child, think about our past life, we couldn't even get enough to eat of bran and vegetables every day. Now we have land and houses, all given to us by Chairman Mao. Jiang Jieshi is here to destroy our good times, who are you going to fight if you don't go fight him?" Wang Guangfan from Beishui Village said, "My family has been hired laborers for three generations. After liberation, we became middle peasants. This is all Chairman Mao's idea. Now Lao Jiang is attacking the border region where Chairman Mao lives. I want to join Chairman Mao's guard regiment and fight Jiang Jieshi to the death." Communist Party members in Wuan County have also proposed joining Chairman Mao's guard regiment. Dozens of outstanding Communist Party members in the county have already signed up. Zhang Shuangzhen, a sharpshooter from Nanfengzhuang who never misses a shot, said, "In the past, I was a pauper, but now I have become a middle peasant. Who gave me these good times? I know it in my heart. I want to go to the border region to protect Chairman Mao."

The new soldiers who signed up to go to the front lines, with the send-off from their parents, wives, and sisters, rushed to the battlefield. The masses in 36 villages in the eighth district of Ci County held a grand send-off meeting. The wives of the new soldiers danced and sang, sending their husbands to the front lines. Especially the women of Shandi and Gangtou villages, whose husbands are all militiamen. This time when they joined the army, they also signed up to join the militia, taking on the tasks of their husbands at home. When seeing them off, they walked shoulder to shoulder with their husbands, draped in bullets and carrying guns, talking as they walked: "Go to the front line and fight the enemy well, don't worry, the work at home is guaranteed to not fall behind...."

The enthusiasm for joining the army is burning throughout the Taihang Mountains. From the towns to every mountain village, the liberated peasants are voluntarily carrying their luggage and rushing to the front lines.

    太行的参军潮
    太行山的翻身农民，听到蒋胡军进攻陕甘宁边区的消息，莫不愤怒填胸。他们一致喊出“上前线保卫毛主席！保卫土地！”仅仅十余天的时间，已有数万青年涌上爱国自卫战争的战场。
    这次参军运动，是在思想翻身的基础上动起来的，全区的翻身农民，工人、商人，学生都纷纷要求上前线“保卫毛主席去”！内邱城关翻身农民，在讨论“保田保果实”问题时，年老的人提出努力生产增加财富；妇女们提出在后方纺织、抬担架照顾伤病员；年青小伙子们都喊出“我们上前线杀敌人，保卫你们”。当场即有二百青年报名参军。武安仅有六户人家的麻地凹村四个青年，正在煤窑挖煤，听到其他工友传说蒋胡军进攻陕北的消息，四个人跑回家就报名参军了。白沙村曹双桂，在煤窑上做工，没顾得回家就报名参军了。北文章李成文老汉在去年就送走两个儿子参军，这次他又把第三个儿子送给八路军，他对三孩说：“三孩，为了保卫咱分的这一处好房子，你也得报名参军去。”河西村的张密的（女）刚刚和王二庄的杨顺的结了婚，这次顺的报名参军时，密的安慰她丈夫说：“你好好在前边打顽固军吧，不要挂念家。”她连夜做了两双鞋、两双袜，准备送顺的上前线，临走时，她买了五百元鸡蛋，给顺的带上，并把她结婚时两千元的拜钱给顺的做盘费。平顺东效村军属桑杨保亲自又把第三个儿子送到区上。给区长说：“保卫毛主席也是保卫自己，自己要不上前线，是指望着谁？”他为什么能这样呢？他说：“我在民国九年饿的实在受不住了，才逃到东效村落户。托人请客才租种上地主徐廷弼的五亩地，谁知收的粮食还不够人家的地租。日本鬼子来了，要饭都吃不饱了。全家就准备逃荒，赶巧碰到王区长，他给我想的办法——减租，我联合了几个穷弟兄将徐廷弼斗争了一下，将那五亩地要回来了。我知道这是共产党毛主席给我的好日子，我一辈子不能忘，在打日本时，我就将两个儿子送走了；现在狗日的攻打毛主席住的地方，凭良心我不能不再送小三去保卫毛主席。”
    涉县索堡翻身老农民郭进中送儿参军时说：“孩，你想想咱过去日子，每天糠菜都吃不饱。现在地也有了，房子也有了，这都是毛主席给咱的。蒋介石来破坏咱的好时光，你不去打他谁去？”北水村王广泛说：“俺家三辈给人家当雇工，翻身后才成了中农，这都是毛主席给咱想下的办法。现在老蒋进攻毛主席住的边区，我要参加毛主席的警卫团，去和蒋介石拚命。”武安县共产党员亦提出参加毛主席警卫团，现该县已有数十名优秀共产党员报名。南冯庄弹不虚发的神枪手张双镇说：“过去我是个穷光蛋，现在成中农了，好时光是谁给我的，我心里明白，我要求上边区保卫毛主席。”
    报名上前线的新战士，在自己的父母、妻子、姊妹欢送下，奔上战场。磁县八区三十六村的群众举行了盛大的欢送会，新战士的妻子扭着秧歌、唱着歌，欢送她们的丈夫到前线去，特别是山底、岗头两村妇女，她们的丈夫都是民兵，这次参军时，她们都又报名参加民兵，担负起丈夫在家的任务。送行时，她们披着子弹扛着枪与丈夫并肩而行，边走边谈：“你到前线好好打敌人，放心吧，家里工作保险落不了后……。”
    参军热火燃烧在整个太行山上，从城镇到每一个山庄，翻身农民都自愿的背起了行李，奔赴前线。
