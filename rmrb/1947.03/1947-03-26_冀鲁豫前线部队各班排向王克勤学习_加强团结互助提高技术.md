    Frontline Troops in the Jiluyu Region Learn from Wang Keqin
    Strengthening Unity and Mutual Assistance, Improving Skills
    [This newspaper's Jiluyu Front, 24th dispatch] The Wang Keqin movement continues to deepen in the Jiluyu Frontline units. All units and every soldier have generally proposed to learn from Wang Keqin. Qiao Yongxi, the artillery platoon leader of a certain company, asked Wang Keqin to tell him his leadership methods. Wang Keqin said: "My method is to let everyone think of solutions." Platoon Leader Qiao held more "Zhuge Liang Meetings," and progressed quickly in politics and tactics, and quickly transformed the newly liberated soldier Yu Honggan. The fourth platoon leader of a certain company led his platoon to study machine guns intensively, and within two days, they learned the technique of Wang Keqin's squad to troubleshoot machine guns in the dark in two minutes. Zhao Xiwei, the seventh squad leader of a certain company, led the whole squad to study Wang Keqin's squad's method of uniting new soldiers through mutual assistance and "introduction meetings," transformed the new soldiers, and cultivated five machine gun shooters within a week. Wang Yue, a newly liberated soldier from the third squad of a certain company, saw Wang Keqin being praised, and knew that the Eighth Route Army would not bury talent, and determined to catch up with Wang Keqin, and soon became a model soldier. Gao Wanxiang, the second squad leader of Wang Keqin's platoon, led the whole squad to work hard to learn from the first squad, the "Wang Keqin Squad."
