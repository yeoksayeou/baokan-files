Ningnan's Land Reform Peasants Join the Army

Liu

I. How to Mobilize

"Defend the land!" "Defend Chairman Mao!" In Ningnan, 3,200 land-reform peasants signed up to join the People's Liberation Army within ten days.

This is a newly liberated area in Jinnan, which has undergone a relatively thorough land reform; with a total population of 130,000 in the county, each person received an average of two to three mu of land. During the movement, land-reform peasants widely and deeply discussed a question: "Now that we have turned ourselves around, how do we defend it?" The education on defending the fruits of victory greatly enhanced the class consciousness of land-reform peasants, deepened their class hatred, and made them clearly aware of the necessity of thoroughly defeating the landlords and consciously participating in the armed forces. At the same time, they further realized the connection between Little Chiang (the landlords) and Big Chiang (Chiang Kai-shek), and consciously felt the sacred duty to join the People's Liberation Army to defeat Big Chiang. On this mass ideological foundation, the leadership put forward the task of 800 people from Ningnan joining the army.

The Ningnan County Party Committee convened a five-day conference and small meetings for county, district, sub-district, and village cadre group leaders and other activists to break through the cadres' thinking about defeating Old Chiang and defending the land. Initially, some people said confidently: "If we mobilize them to go, we will definitely complete the task." Who are "them"? "Are you mobilizing me to go? Why don't you go? Why don't you mobilize yourself?" The question immediately delved into a focal point of thought. "Really! Why don't I mobilize myself to go?" The thought slowly brewed and developed, so "I'll go, you'll go too, we'll go first, and they'll eventually go." The leadership promptly gathered several encouraging slogans from the masses: "To forge iron, one must first be strong oneself!" "Being able to join and expand the army is a hero!" "Good cadres take the lead and hook up; hook up, strive for the locomotive, and hook up to forty-eight carriages!" (The most carriages on the Pinghan Railway are forty-eight). After such full mobilization and resolving the work of preferential treatment for military families and some cadres' family concerns, the cadre challenge competition movement between districts, sub-districts, groups, and individuals immediately unfolded. In each village, more than 2,000 people automatically signed up to join the army at one time, including the cadres themselves.

After the cadres returned, from the county cadre to the district, from the district cadre to the village, mass mobilization meetings were held, and the industrial, agricultural, youth, women, and military departments held system meetings, and small group meetings were held to conduct more profound ideological education: "Reforming oneself must be thorough." How can it be considered thorough? Consolidating the fruits of victory is considered thorough! How to consolidate the fruits of victory? Only by taking up arms. Why were the landlords so tough in the past? Because they controlled the guns. Thus, the ideological slogans of "thoroughly reforming oneself," "controlling the guns," "defending the land," and "defending Chairman Mao" became the slogans of mass action in various villages. The mass competition movement of mutual challenges between individuals, cadres and the masses, groups, and villages was also launched like the county congress. In the three towns of Dongwang Village in the county, the South Town took the lead in launching a challenge, guaranteeing the completion of thirteen people, the West Town responded by exceeding the South Town by three times, and the East Town's goal was to exceed the West Town by one-third. In Mafang Village with more than 200 households, the entire village had more than 130 young adults, and 74 of them collectively signed up to join the army at this meeting (after inspection, 55 remained). Among them, 31 wives sent their husbands, 9 fathers sent their sons, 2 fathers and sons joined the army, and there were also brothers who went to the battlefield together, and veterans who joined the battlefield for the second time. Within ten days, 3,200 people collectively signed up to join the army in the whole county, including 300 women, 138 Communist Party members, and more than 30 village and above cadres. The new recruits who signed up in various villages were not sent away immediately, and the village's preferential treatment committee fully resolved various problems in the preferential treatment of military families in such a short period of time. Some good preferential treatment committees even hired long-term workers for military families with preferential treatment funds to fully ensure the production and labor of military families. Some villages with more recruits also implemented adjustments on a sub-district basis to reasonably reduce the burden of preferential treatment for military families on the masses. These facts further strengthened the new recruits' determination to defend their homes and kill the enemy. Even if individual immature new recruits temporarily changed their minds, they would receive education and help from the masses of the whole village during this period of stay before departure, and quickly strengthen their determination. Such a stay played a great role in strengthening the ideological maturity of the new recruits and consolidating the troops.

Before the departure of the new recruits, each village held a solemn oath-taking ceremony - signing a guarantee letter. This is a beautifully printed three-part form: one is given to the village cadre, one is given to the soldier, and one is given to the government. The conditions to be filled in are decided by the masses themselves: for example, the new recruit says: "I will never go home until Old Chiang is defeated." "If I desert, I am not a hero." The village cadre's guarantee says: "If the family members are not taken care of, I am willing to compensate with my own land." The democratic government then stated on the spot: "In the future, we will check the work of both parties based on the certificate, and those who do well will be rewarded."

After layers of education and encouragement, 1,289 new recruits remained after six strict inspections from the villages to the district in Ningnan County. The eliminated youths cried and refused to go home. Some were so angry that they did not eat for two or three days. Later, after an eight or nine hundred li long journey, they arrived at the front line without any desertions, and the number gradually increased along the way. Because those youths who were eliminated and unwilling to go home caught up with the troops again on the way.

Why is the conscription work in Ningnan so smooth? First, it seized the principle of breaking through the thinking of cadres and activists, and grasping the principle of "to forge iron, one must first be strong oneself," so that the cadres truly played an exemplary leading role among the masses, and at the same time overcame the ideological concerns of "if the cadres are pulled out, the work cannot be done." The leadership promptly put forward: "Don't be afraid of pulling them out, be bold and let go; even if they are pulled out, new cadres can grow out of the masses." When the masses saw that the cadres dared to do it, their courage also increased, so the number expanded particularly. Second, because the masses had a foundation in their thinking beforehand. The education on defending the fruits of victory was closely carried out during the land reform, which unprecedentedly improved the political thinking of land-reform peasants in defending their homes and defending themselves.

II. How to Send Troops

In this conscription movement, Ningnan has also created valuable experience in sending troops. More than 1,000 new recruits in the whole county arrived at the front from this county, and were able to avoid desertion after a journey of eight or nine hundred li. The main reason is that the leadership took the mass line, believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and tried to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses.

Before they set off, they convened a meeting of cadres above the company level of the new recruits to carry out ideological mobilization. Then, each company convened a branch committee and an activist meeting (including party members and non-party members) to specifically study how to consolidate the troops during the march.

According to the discussion, the new recruits, under the principle of voluntariness, organized mutual aid groups, with three to five people in a group, and three to five groups in each class. When organizing the mutual aid group, the slogan was put forward: "Help with walking and marching labor, guarantee each other politically, and do not desert." After the mutual aid group was organized, each company convened a soldiers' congress with the company as the unit, concentrated the discussion of the masses, formulated a covenant, and swore on the spot to ensure that no desertions occurred. At the same time, at the activity meeting of each company, the challenge competition was launched from bottom to top with the class as the unit, electing models, opposing "backwardness," and putting forward the conditions of the competition: "Ensure that there is no desertion in the whole class and the whole group." A review was conducted every three days. The review and commendation were completely through the mass line, and the units or individuals who were publicly recognized by the masses as doing a good job in consolidating the troops during the march were given various commendations at the general meeting, and everyone stood up and applauded them; the leadership also called on them to learn from them. Other units also had to send representatives to "study abroad" and visit. During the march, these model units walked in front. For individuals, there were also material rewards such as notebooks, towels, soap, and cigarettes. The enthusiasm of the masses was stimulated. The idea of "everyone cherishing their reputation and not wanting to fall behind" slowly became the most glorious and strong will of every new recruit.

In the high tide of competition, the soldiers also automatically launched a struggle against the "chicken feathers" (deserters) among individual wavering and backward elements. They were very dissatisfied with the fact that a few "chicken feathers" damaged the reputation of the entire company, and everyone had the requirement and determination to thoroughly oppose the "chicken feathers." Because the masses themselves stood up to supervise, any "chicken feathers" would definitely be caught. After catching the "chicken feathers," everyone immediately checked the covenant, commended the "chicken feathers" catching heroes, explained the shamefulness of the "chicken feathers," and promoted their reflection and awakening. This kind of struggle was very successful, and after this kind of struggle, there were very few "chicken feathers."

During the march, the leadership promptly grasped the changes in the thinking of the masses. In fact, the thinking of new recruits often fluctuated during the march; for example, when they left this county, everyone was very afraid of being unfamiliar and felt unhappy, and the leadership was good at using concrete examples to explain that being unfamiliar was temporary, and everyone would become familiar with each other slowly by living together. At the same time, they also promptly put forward the encouraging slogan of "poor people all over the world are one family" on the ideological basis of the new recruits' class consciousness, which expanded the small scope of everyone's hometown concept. For example, when they approached the front line, they were afraid when they heard cannons and airplanes, and then they were allowed to visit the prisoner of war camp by the way. The actual examples educated them: the enemy is not terrible; the morale of the soldiers was suddenly improved. At this time, the front line had just won a victory, and they seized this point to tell everyone that our front line had already won a victory, and quickly went to capture prisoners and move new weapons, and everyone's emotions were even higher, and they were willing to rush to the front line quickly.

After arriving at the troops, the new recruits were unwilling to be broken up too much, and the troops tried their best to take care of this. After the reorganization, the troops convened a welcome meeting for the new recruits, and everyone spoke. The new recruits said: "Today I have nothing else to say, I want to fight Old Chiang, I must learn from the old soldiers, I will answer the chief that I will never desert." Some captured soldiers in the troops, as soon as they saw the new recruits, immediately asked how they came, and when the new recruits introduced the situation, the captured soldiers were deeply moved, and some even cried. In this way, some old soldiers who initially looked down on the new recruits also changed their views. They said: "This time a group of political instructors has come, which is better than going to a few political classes!" Therefore, under the spirit of mutual respect and mutual learning, the three types of soldiers (old soldiers, new soldiers, liberated soldiers) quickly blended together.

When I went to visit the new recruits in each battalion the day after the reorganization, they were all very happy. They had no other requirements. A new recruit fiddled with the large cap gun in his hand, and a round plate of bullets coiled around his waist, and he guaranteed to me: "Please don't worry, we will definitely win glory for Ningnan County, and in order to defend the fruits of land reform and defend Chairman Mao, fighting Old Chiang will never fall behind!"

    宁南翻身农民参军记
    柳
     一、怎样动员
    “保卫土地！”“保卫毛主席！”宁南翻身农民，在十天内有三千二百人，报名参加人民解放军。
    这是冀南一个新区，经过较为彻底的土地改革；全县十三万人口，每人平均获得土地二亩至三亩。运动过程中，翻身农民广泛深入讨论了一个问题：“我们翻了身，如何去保卫？”保卫果实的教育，大大提高了翻身农民的阶级觉悟，加深了他们的阶级仇恨，使他们明确彻底打垮地主，自觉参加武装的必要。同时，也进一步认识到小蒋（地主）与大蒋的联系，自觉有参加人民解放军去打败大蒋的神圣义务。在这样的群众思想基础上，领导上向宁南提出了八百人的参军任务。
    宁南县委召集县、区、小区、村干小组长等干部积极分子，开了五天大会和小会，打通干部打败老蒋、保卫土地的思想。开初一些人很自信的说：“动员他们去，一定能完成任务。”“他们”是谁呢？“你动员我去吗？为啥你不去呢？为啥不动员你自己呢？”问题马上深入到一个思想的焦点。“真的！为啥不动员我自己去呢？”思想慢慢酝酿发展，于是“我去你也去，咱先去，他们总会去。”领导上又及时从群众中集中了几个鼓动性的口号：“打铁首先本身硬！”“能参能扩是好汉！”“好干部带头挂钩；钩挂钩，争取火车头，要挂满四十八辆车！”（平汉路火车最多挂四十八辆）经过这样的充分动员，并解决了优军工作和一些干部的家庭顾虑之后，区与区、小区与小区、组与组、个人与个人的干部挑战竞赛运动就立刻开展起来了。各村一次自动报名参军的人员达两千余名，干部自己也包括在内。
    干部回去后，县干到区，区干到村，召开群众动员大会，工农青妇武各部门召开系统会议，又开小组会，更深刻的进行了思想教育：“翻身要彻底”，怎样才算彻底？巩固果实才算彻底！如何巩固果实？只有起来掌握枪杆。过去地主为啥硬？因为他们掌握了枪杆。于是，“彻底翻身”、“掌握枪杆”、“保卫土地”、“保卫毛主席”的思想鼓动口号就成了各村群众行动的口号。个人与个人、干部与群众、小组与小组、村与村的互相挑战的群众竞赛运动、也就和县大会一样掀起来了。该县东汪村东南西三镇的群众，南镇首先发起挑战，保证完成十三人，西镇的回答却是超过南镇三倍，东镇的目标则是超过西镇三分之一。二百多户的马房村，全村青壮共一百三十余人，此次大会上集体报名参军的就达七十四人（后经过检验剩了五十五人）其中妻子送丈夫的三十一人，父送子九人，父子参军的两人，也有弟兄同上战场的，也有复员军人二次上战场的。全县在十天内，集体报名参军的达三千二百人，妇女报名的也有三百人，共产党员一百卅八人，村以上干部三十余人。各村报名的新战士，没有马上把他们送走，村的优军委员会就在这样短促期内，首先圆满的解决了优军中的各种问题；有些好的优军委员会，并用优军款替军属雇下了长工，以充分保证军属家庭的生产劳作。有些参军较多的村庄，又以小区为单位实行了调剂，合理的减轻了群众优军的负担。这些事实更加坚定了新战士保家杀敌的意志。即使个别不成熟的新战士临时发生了变故，也会在出发前的这段停留期中，得到全村群众的教育帮助，迅速坚定起来。这样的停留，对加强新战士的思想成熟和巩固部队，都起了很大的作用。
    新战士出发前，各村举行了庄严的宣誓仪式——立保证书。这是一种印制精美的三连单：一条交村干，一条交战士，一条交政府。填写的条件，由群众自己决定：如新战士说：“不打垮老蒋永不回家”。“如开小差，不算好汉”。村干部的保证说：“若对家属照顾不到，愿拿自己土地赔偿”。民主政府则当场表示：“今后要凭证检查双方工作，谁作得好，还要奖励。”
    经过层层的教育和鼓励后，宁南全县新战士由村送到分区，经过六次严格检查之后，还剩下一千二百八十九人。被检查掉的青年哭哭涕涕，坚决不愿回家。有的气得两三天都不吃饭。以后经过八九百里的长途，送达了前线没有发生逃亡，沿途反而逐渐增多了。因为那些验掉不愿回家的青年，半路上又赶上部队了。
    宁南参军工作为什么这样顺利呢？第一、就是抓住了打通干部和积极分子的思想，掌握了“打铁首先本身硬”的原则，使干部真正在群众中起了模范的带头作用，同时也克服了“干部拔枯了，工作不能干”的那种不放手的思想顾虑。领导上及时提出了：“不怕拔枯了，要大胆放手；即使拔枯了，群众中也可以生长出来新干部。”群众看到干部都敢干，自己勇气也就大了，所以数量扩得特别多。第二、由于群众事先在思想上有了基础。土地改革中密切进行了保卫果实的教育，使翻身农民的保家自卫的政治思想空前的提高。
  二、怎样送兵
    此次参军运动中，宁南又创造了宝贵的送兵工作经验。全县一千多位新战士，从本县抵达前方，经过了八九百里的行程，能够作到没有逃亡。其主要原因，是领导上走群众路线，相信群众、依靠群众，尽量发挥群众的积极性。
    在没有出发前，他们就召开了新战士连以上干部会，进行思想动员。接着各连又召开了支委会，积极分子大会（包括党员与非党员），具体研究行军中如何巩固部队的问题。
    根据讨论，新战士在自愿原则下，组织起互助小组，以三五人为一小组，每班建立三组至五组不等。组织互助组时，提出口号：“走路行军劳力帮助，政治上互相保证，不开小差。”互助组组织起来后，各连即以连为单位，召开军人大会，集中群众的讨论，制订公约，并当场宣誓，保证不发生逃亡。同时，又在各连活动分子会上，以班为单位自下而上发动挑战竞赛，选举模范，反对“落后”，并提出竞赛的条件：“保证全班全组没有一个逃亡。”三天评判一次。评判表扬完全通过群众路线，群众公认在行军中巩固部队好的单位或个人，在全体大会上即受到各种表扬，大家都起立向他鼓掌；领导上并号召向他学习。其他单位还要派代表去“留洋”参观，行军时，这些模范单位即走在前面，对于个人，还有笔记本、毛巾、肥皂、纸烟等物质奖励。群众的进取心激发起来了。“大伙爱护名誉，不甘落后”的思想，便慢慢成为每个新战士最光荣的坚强的意志了。
    在高度的竞赛热潮中，战士们又自动的对个别动摇落后分子开展了反“草鸡毛”（开小差的人）斗争。他们对少数“草鸡毛”破坏了全连的名誉，都非常不满，大家都有彻底反“草鸡毛”斗争的要求和决心。由于群众自己起来监督，因此有“草鸡毛”一定就会被捉住。捉住“草鸡毛”后，大家即进行检查公约，表扬捉“草鸡毛”英雄，说明“草鸡毛”的可耻，而促其反省觉悟。这样的斗争很成功，经过这样斗争后，“草鸡毛”就很少了。
    在行军中，领导上及时掌握了群众思想的变化。实际上，新战士在行军中，思想是经常波动的；如离开本县时，大家都很怕生疏感到不愉快，领导上就善于用具体的例子，去解释生疏是暂时的，大家生活在一起慢慢大家就熟了。同时，他们又在新战士阶级觉悟的思想上及时提出了“天下穷人是一家”的鼓动口号，这样就把每个人乡土观念的小范围扩大了。又如接近前线时，他们听到大炮飞机就害怕，以后即让他们顺便参观了俘虏营，实际的例子教育了他们：敌人并不可怕；战士们的士气就顿时提高了。这时前方正打了胜仗，他们又抓紧这一点告诉大家我们前方已打了胜仗，赶快去捉俘虏，搬新武器，大家的情绪更加高涨，都愿意赶快赶到前线去。
    到部队后，新战士都不愿意拆得太零散，部队也尽量照顾了这点。整编后，部队即召开了欢迎新战士大会，大家都讲了话。新战士说：“今天我没有旁的话说，我要打老蒋，我必须向老战士学习，我答复首长我决不开小差。”部队里有些俘虏兵，他们一见新战士即询问是怎样来的，当新战士把情形介绍后，俘虏兵都深深的感动了，有的甚至哭了。这样一来，开始有些看不起新战士的老战士，也转变了观念。他们说：“这次可来了一批政治教员，这比上几堂政治课还强呢！”因此在互相尊重、互相学习的精神下，三种战士（老战士、新战士、解放战士）很快就融洽了。
    当改编后第二天，我去各营探望新战士的时候，他们都很欢喜。他们没有别的要求。一位新战士搬弄着手里的大盖枪，腰间盘着圆圆的一盘子弹，向我保证说：“请别耽心，我们决为宁南县争光，为了保卫翻身果实保卫毛主席，打老蒋是永不会落后的！”
