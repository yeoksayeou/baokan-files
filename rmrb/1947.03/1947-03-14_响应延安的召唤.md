　　Responding to the Call of Yan'an
    The situation has developed to a new juncture. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries have expelled our personnel stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places, and are妄想attempting to extend their bloody claws to Yan'an. A crazy atmosphere of terror shrouds the Chiang-controlled areas, but the masses' resistance struggle is intensifying. The Taiwan people's uprising troops have already established an autonomous government. The dark rule of the Four Big Families is in a precarious situation. It is in this environment that we heard the call to battle from the soldiers and civilians of Yan'an: "We demand that all 140 million people in the liberated areas, 1.5 million People's Liberation Army soldiers, and millions of militia members rise up together to defend Yan'an and defend Chairman Mao, launching even more fierce annihilating blows against the Chiang troops, striving for even more glorious victories, in order to quickly end the civil war and end Chiang Kai-shek's disastrous and dictatorial rule that harms the country and the people." (Telegram from the Yan'an All-Circles Mobilization Rally) We call on all troops, organs, schools, and organizations, both at the front and in the rear, without exception, to hold meetings to discuss the Yan'an Mobilization Rally telegram and the calls from Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, and to formulate combat action plans to respond. The front should strive to fight, and the rear should intensify work. Every organization must respond, and every comrade must respond. This is our sacred duty. Combat heroes like Wang Keqin are the best examples. We are in a great era when the storm is about to arrive. Revive yourselves, and perform meritorious service for the people! Perform meritorious service for the motherland! Fight to defend Yan'an, to defend Chairman Mao! Fight to end Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule! Forward!

　　响应延安的召唤
    时局发展到了新的关头。蒋介石反动派把我驻京、沪、渝等地人员驱逐出境，并妄想将其血爪伸到延安。蒋管区各地笼罩着疯狂的怖恐，但群众反抗斗争却愈演愈烈。台湾民变兵已建立了自治政权。四大家族的黑暗统治，处在风雨飘摇之中。我们就是在这样环境中听到了延安军民战斗的召唤：“我们要求全解放区一万万四千万人民，一百五十万人民解放军和数百万民兵，一致奋起为保卫延安、保卫毛主席展开对蒋军更猛烈的歼灭性打击，争取更辉煌的胜利，以便迅速结束内战，结束蒋介石的祸国殃民的独裁的统治。”（延安各界动员大会通电）我们号召前后方一切部队、机关、学校、团体，无例外地开会讨论延安动员大会通电及朱总司令、彭副总司令、周恩来同志等的号召，并订出战斗的行动计划，以为响应。前方努力作战，后方加紧工作。每个组织都要响应，每个同志都要响应。这是我们神圣的义务。杀敌英雄王克勤等就是最好的榜样。我们是处在暴风雨即将到来的大时代。振奋起来，为人民立功！为祖国立功！为保卫延安，保卫毛主席而战！为结束蒋介石反动统治而战！前进啊！
