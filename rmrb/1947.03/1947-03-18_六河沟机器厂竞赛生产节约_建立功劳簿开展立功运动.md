　　Six River Ditch Machine Factory Competes in Production and Conservation; Establishes Merit Book and Launches Merit Campaign
    [This Newspaper] The Six River Ditch Machine Factory's foundry department, responding to Comrade Bo Yibo's call, has set out a production competition plan and established a merit book to launch a merit campaign.
    The factory's plan for production, conservation, and tool maintenance includes: 1. Guaranteeing no reduction in quality while increasing output by one-third. For example, making a "yuan" car previously required 157 work hours at the fastest, now it will be guaranteed to be completed in 100 work hours. Previously, making a set of gears required nine work hours; now, making two sets will take six work hours, generally increasing efficiency by one-half. 2. Scrap products will not exceed 5 to 10 percent. 3. Use waste iron wire instead of wire nails, coke powder instead of lead powder, and wood chips instead of iron chips. Immediately seal the furnace after use, and pick up and reuse any coke that is not fully burned. 4. Take care of tools, placing them in tool containers or hanging them on the wall after work. Study how to改造 (transform/remodel) sandboxes and tools to be both labor-saving and durable.
    Regarding working conditions: 1. Change the eight-hour work system to nine hours, no smoking, and no absenteeism. 2. Unity between master and apprentice, with everyone helping to solve difficulties.

    [This Newspaper] The Workers' Union of the Jinan Bank Issuing Office held an expanded executive committee meeting on the 28th of last month to study production and conservation issues. In terms of production, it was decided to develop sideline production such as textile, transportation, and barbering, with each person contributing 7,000 yuan to the public. Vegetable growing will be self-sufficient for half a year. In terms of conservation, in addition to personal conservation, all workers in the agency will be mobilized to add two days of voluntary work per month, and paper cigarettes will be completely eliminated starting in March. According to preliminary statistics, the annual production and conservation can reach more than 23 million yuan.

　　六河沟机器厂竞赛生产节约
    建立功劳簿开展立功运动
    【本报讯】六河沟机器厂翻砂部响应薄一波同志号召，订出生产竞赛计划；并建立功劳簿，开展立功运动。
    该厂计划在生产节约爱护工具方面：一、保证质量不减低，产量提高到三分之一。如作元车，过去最快需工一百五十七个，今后保证以一百个工完成。过去作牙轮一套需九个工、现在作两套用六个工，一般提高到二分之一。二、作废活不超过百分之五到百分之十。三、以废铁丝代替洋钉，焦炭面代替铅粉，木片代替铁片，用完炉子即马上封火，未烧透之焦炭拣起再用。四、爱护工具，下班工具放在工具器内，或挂在墙上，研究砂箱工具如何改造得又省工又耐用。
    在工作条件方面：一、把八小时工作制改为九小时，不吸烟、不误工。二、师徒团结，有困难大家帮助解决。
          （熔铸）
    【本报讯】冀南银行发行处职工总会于上月二十八日召开执委扩大会议，研究生产节约问题，生产方面决定开展纺织、运输、理发等副业生产，每人交公七千元。种菜做到半年自给，节约方面除个人节约外，并发动全机关工人每月加两天义务工，从三月起根绝纸烟。据初步统计，全年生产节约可达二千三百余万元。
