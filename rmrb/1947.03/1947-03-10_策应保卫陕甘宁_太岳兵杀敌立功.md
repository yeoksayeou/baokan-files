　　Coordinating to Defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia
    Taiyue Soldiers Kill Enemies and Achieve Meritorious Service
    [Our Taiyue dispatch, 8th] Last December, the Taiyue militia launched a meritorious service campaign to defend Yan'an and Chairman Mao, achieving the brilliant result of annihilating more than 2,000 enemies. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek attacked Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia again. The Taiyue Military Headquarters specifically issued a call on the 3rd for the entire region to launch another campaign to kill enemies and achieve meritorious service. It stipulated that from March 15th to April 15th, the glorious task of annihilating 1,000 enemies must be completed within the time limit, and all cadres and militia members must perform at least one meritorious service.
    [Our Taiyue dispatch, 8th] As Chiang's troops along the Tongpu Railway invade the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, the guerrilla warfare in southern Shanxi is becoming increasingly active. The Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Brigade intercepted a large Chiang-puppet transport team loaded with military grain, consisting of 43 carts, in Cao Zhang, Shuitou, and other places south of Wenyan on the 16th of last month. The Xinjiang Guerrilla Brigade attacked and destroyed lines between Wenxi Lizhuang on the 20th, collecting more than 1,000 catties of wires.
    [Our Taiyue dispatch, 8th] In 45 days from January 1st to February 15th, the Huoxian militia fought 46 times using tactics such as explosions and sniping, annihilating 101 enemies and seizing two machine guns and three rifles. The Yinshang joint defense zone twice repelled enemy attacks of more than 1,000 people, creating the first major victory for the region's militia this year. The Military Headquarters specifically issued a commendation.
    [Our Taiyue dispatch, 8th] A certain unit of the Liberation Detachment launched a new meritorious service campaign on the 3rd, calling on everyone to perform a meritorious service for the people this year, killing one to one and a half enemies. It also called on Communist Party members, enemy-killing heroes, and model workers to lead everyone in performing meritorious service, and the entire army should learn from the special-class enemy-killing hero Jing Laifa. The unit established meritorious service evaluation committees at all levels and adopted democratic methods to evaluate meritorious service. Meritorious service is divided into three classes, and those with three meritorious services of the same class are promoted by one class. Meritorious service is one of the conditions for promoting cadres. A meritorious service introduction letter is issued upon transfer. Meritorious service lists are published on time, medals are awarded, and good news reports are printed. For soldiers who have families in the liberated areas, the good news reports are also sent to their homes. Now, all battalions and companies and individuals are busy formulating meritorious service plans, keeping pace with Comrade Jing Laifa.

　　策应保卫陕甘宁
    太岳兵杀敌立功
    【本报太岳八日电】去年十二月，太岳民兵掀起立功运动保卫延安、保卫毛主席，获歼敌二千余人辉煌战果。最近蒋介石又进攻陕甘宁，太岳武总特于三日号召全区再次展开杀敌立功运动。规定三月十五日至四月十五日，限期完成杀敌一千名的光荣任务，全体干部及民兵每人至少立功一件。
    【本报太岳八日电】在同蒲沿线蒋军西犯陕甘宁边区之际，晋南游击战争益趋活跃。赵川游击大队于上月十六日在闻言以南曹张、水头等地截获蒋伪运输大队满载军粮的大车四十三辆；新绛游击队于二十日在闻喜礼庄间破击，收割电线千余斤。
    【本报太岳八日电】霍县民兵于一月一日至二月十五日四十五天内，以爆炸冷枪等战术作战四十六次，歼敌一百零一名，缴机枪两挺，步枪三支。阴的联防区曾两次击溃敌千人以上的进攻，创全区民兵今年首次大胜利，武总特通令表扬。
    【本报太岳八日电】解放支队某部于三日开展新的立功运动，号召每人今年要为人民立一件功劳，杀敌一个至一个半。更号召共产党员、杀敌英雄、模范工作者带领大家立功，全军要向特等杀敌英雄荆来发学习。该部在各级单位成立评功委员会，采用民主方式评功。功劳分三等，同等功劳三次者提升一等。立功为提升干部条件之一。调动时发功劳介绍信。并按时出功劳榜，发奖章、印喜报，在解放区有家的战士立了功，还把喜报送到他们家里。现在各营连及个人正忙着订立功计划，向荆来发同志看齐。
