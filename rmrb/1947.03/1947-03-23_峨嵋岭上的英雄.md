    Hero of Emei Ridge
    Taiyue Branch
    Lying horizontally at the junction of Wen and Xia counties, a forty-li-long earthen ridge—Emei Ridge—is the hometown of Ren Keliang, a people's militia hero from southern Shanxi. Like other farmers, he loves this fertile land. Since the Chiang Kai-shek's army occupied southern Shanxi, Ren Keliang has shouldered his gun and never left this place. He said, "I, Ren Keliang, was born on Emei, grew up on Emei, was emancipated on Emei, and fight on Emei. I will not let Chiang Kai-shek occupy this good place." Last year, the Chiang-Yan army mobilized forces of over a thousand men several times to "encircle and suppress" and "mop up" on Emei Ridge, but they completely failed to eliminate the militia led by Ren Keliang; instead, they were repeatedly repelled by Ren Keliang's militia team. The enemy's fear of Ren Keliang increased day by day, and the "Love-the-Hometown Corps" issued an order: "Whoever captures Ren Keliang alive will be heavily rewarded by the county." But who dared to approach Ren Keliang? In September, the stubborn county magistrate came up with a deceptive trick, saying to Ren Keliang's mother: "As long as you can call your son back, I will be responsible for guaranteeing his safety. And I will hang a plaque on your door, so that neither the Central Army nor the Second War Zone will be allowed to enter your home at will," and he left a letter for her to pass on to Ren Keliang. When this letter reached Ren Keliang's hands, he tore it up without hesitation, "Even if they destroy my house, they can't destroy me; I still have to fight." The threat of the stubborn puppet government destroying his home deepened his hatred for the enemy, and his guerrilla activities became even more vigorous. In the two months from mid-September to November 20th, they killed 42 enemies and captured 2 machine guns, 21 rifles, and 1 pistol. On December 24th last year, Ren Keliang led the militia to burn down eight enemy blockhouses on the ridge. The next day, the enemy from the Bingtou stronghold, with two companies of troops, rushed to Xiaozhao Village in an attempt to capture Ren Keliang alive. He, along with Guo Yumu and Guo Zhongya, avoided the enemy's sight, turned out of the village, and fired from under an earthen mound thirty meters away from the enemy, suppressing the enemy inside the temple. They threw hand grenades into the temple, and the enemy was forced to flee outwards. Guo Zhongya grabbed a stubborn soldier, who fled in a panic, defecating in fear. They pursued for more than ten li, and machine-gunned two stubborn soldiers to death. Once, Ren Keliang accidentally shot himself and was injured. Others advised him to rest in the hospital for a few more days, but he said to everyone, "In the past, people said that a hero doesn't bear three parts of illness. It's not a big deal to me. I can't calm down until I take down those bastards." He left the ward with his militia, braved dangers, and sneaked into Xinzhuang Village to launch an ambush, capturing another three enemies and seizing three guns. In January, more than 300 of Chiang Kai-shek's troops returned from "encircling and suppressing" from Dayang Town and ran into Ren Keliang's militia team. The enemy concentrated 19 machine guns, one mortar, and six or seven grenade launchers to fire at them. Ren Keliang's militia team, with only a dozen people, resisted the fire while retreating to an underground dugout to fight the enemy, repelling them. This time, they captured another six people and six guns. Relying on his native Emei Ridge, Ren Keliang dispatched troops day and night to attack the enemy's transportation, and has so far captured more than 30 carts, 4 bicycles, and more than 30 *shi* of wheat. He has become a banner for persisting in the struggle against the enemy on Emei Ridge.

    峨嵋岭上的英雄
    太岳分社
    横躺在闻夏交界处长约四十华里的一条土梁——峨嵋岭，便是晋南民兵英雄任克良的家乡。他和其他农民一样，热爱这块肥沃的土地。蒋军侵占晋南以来，任克良就扛起枪，从没有离开这地方一步。他说：“我任克良生在峨嵋，长在峨嵋，翻身在峨嵋，战斗在峨嵋，我不能让蒋介石占住这个好地方。”去年蒋阎军几次调动千人以上的兵力，在峨嵋岭上“清剿”“扫荡”，完全没有打掉任克良率领的民兵，反被任克良的民兵队打退了。敌人对任克良的恐惧一天比一天增加了，“爱乡团”传下命令：“生擒任克良者县上重赏”。但是，谁敢接近任克良呢？九月，顽县长想出一个欺骗的办法，对任克良的母亲说：“只要能叫你儿子回来，我负责担保无事。并且给你门上挂一个牌子，无论中央军二战区都不准随便进你的家”，并留了一封信要他转给任克良。这封信传到任克良手里，他毫不犹豫的撕掉了，“毁了我的房，毁不了我，还是要干”。顽伪毁家的威胁，更加深了他对敌人的仇恨，游击活动越加起劲了。从九月中旬到十一月二十号的后两个月，他们毙敌四十二名，缴获机枪两挺、步枪二十一支、短枪一支。去年十二月二十四日，任克良领着民兵到岭上烧了敌人八个炮楼，翌日冰头据点敌人以两个连兵力赶到小赵村，企图活捉任克良。他和郭玉木、郭中亚三个人避过敌人的视线，转出村子，在离敌三十多公尺的土＠下射击，敌人被压入庙内。他们向庙里扔手榴弹，敌人被迫往外逃走，郭中亚一把抓住一个顽军，敌人便屎滚尿流的逃窜了。他们追击十余里，机枪打死两个顽军。有一次，任克良自己走了火，受了伤，别人都劝他在医院多休养几天，他向大家说：“过去有人说好汉不担三分病，搁到咱身上不当紧，不把那些孙子干倒心静不下去。”他离开病房带着自己的民兵，不避艰险的摸到新庄村打了一个伏击，又俘敌人三个、缴枪三支。一月里，蒋军三百余人由大洋镇“清剿”回来，与任克良的民兵队碰了头。敌人集中十九挺机枪、一门迫击炮、六七个掷弹筒向他们射击，任克良民兵队仅十余人，冒着炮火一面抵抗，一面退到一个地＠下与敌人对战，将敌击退，这次又俘获人枪各六。任克良依靠生长他的峨嵋岭，日日夜夜出动袭击敌人运输，迄今已缴获大车三十多辆，自行车四辆，小麦三十余石。他已成为峨嵋岭上坚持对敌斗争的旗帜。
