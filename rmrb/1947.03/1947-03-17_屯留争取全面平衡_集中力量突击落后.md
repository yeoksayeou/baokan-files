　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th】In Tunliu County, 214 out of 224 administrative villages have basically completed land reform (accounting for more than 90% of the county's administrative villages). Farmers have recovered more than 127,000 mu of land and more than 140,000 shi of fine grains (converted from various fruits). Out of the county's 31,602 households, 25,353 have received land and grain. The original number of poor peasant households was over 9,000, and now each person has an average of 2.4 mu of land. More than 8,000 households have risen to the level of middle and rich peasants (accounting for 89% of the original number of households). The original number of destitute peasant households was over 3,000, and 2,811 households have risen to the level of middle and rich peasants. The rest have risen to the level of poor peasants. Destitution has been completely eliminated. In many villages, poor peasants have also been completely eliminated. For example, in Yuli Village, all 58 poor peasant households and 8 destitute households have risen to the level of middle peasants. In Dongxing'an Village, all poor and destitute peasants have risen to the level of rich middle peasants. The number of peasant association members in the county has grown to more than 60,000, accounting for 50% of the total population. More than 16,000 militiamen have been developed, accounting for more than 13% of the total population. The movement has absorbed a large number of women to participate in the struggle, and some women have also joined the militia. (The above are statistics for 214 villages). However, in some villages, the enthusiasm of cadres and activists has led to excessive gains or embezzlement of fruits, which has affected the thoroughness and depth of the movement. This is now being actively addressed. Since February 10th, the entire county has concentrated its efforts to attack the 28 backward villages that have not yet been completed, and the movement is also nearing its end.

　　屯留争取全面平衡
    集中力量突击落后
    【本报太岳十五日电】屯留全县二百二十四个行政村中，已有二百一十四个基本完成了土地改革（占全县行政村百分之九十以上）。农民们收回土地十二万七千余亩，细粮（各种果实折合）十四万余石。全县三万一千六百零二户中，有二万五千三百五十三户得到土地和粮食。贫农原有九千余户，现每人平均有地二亩四分，上升中农与富农的共八千余户，（占原户数百分之八十九）。赤贫原有三千余户，上升中农和富农的二千八百十一户，其余均上升为贫农。赤贫已全部消灭。许多村庄贫农亦全部消灭，如峪里村贫农五十八户，赤贫八户，都全部上升为中农。东兴岸村贫农、赤贫全部上升富中农。全县农会会中员发展到六万余人，占全人口百分之五十。发展民兵一万六千余人；占全人口百分之十三强。在运动中吸收了广大妇女参加斗争，并有一部分妇女参加了民兵。（以上为二百十四村的统计）。但有些村庄因干部积极分子多得或贪污果实，影响了运动的彻底深入，现正积极解决中。从二月十日开始，全县集中力量突击落后，尚未完成的二十八个村，运动亦将近结束。
