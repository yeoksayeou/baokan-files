　　Turning themselves around to help everyone turn around
    Yushe Xishan Village Cadres Refuse Rewards from the Masses
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 15th] Pei Zhiyu, the village chief of Shangxishan Village in Yushe, political director Li Erzhi, Farmers' Association Chairman Pei Sanyuan, and Militia Committee Director Zhao Fuzhong, have all achieved a turnaround during previous rent reduction and debt liquidation campaigns. In this land redistribution movement, they did not take even a thread or strand from the fruits of the struggle. They distributed everything to the masses. Because they led the turnaround day and night, the masses specially offered them twenty sheep and one hundred thousand yuan as rewards. But they all declined, saying, "We have already turned ourselves around, we cannot accept this. The merit belongs to everyone, and the turnaround should be for everyone. Chairman Mao's cadres are here for the masses." The masses said, "You are our village's Chairman Mao." Under their leadership, all 175 households in the village have achieved land equalization. There is no conflict between cadres and the masses. The whole village is as united as a family, and they are actively engaged in production and wealth creation.
