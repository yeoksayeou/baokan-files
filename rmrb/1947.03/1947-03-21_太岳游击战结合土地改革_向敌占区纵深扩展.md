    Taiyue Guerrilla Warfare Combined with Land Reform
    Extends Deep into Enemy-Occupied Areas
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Summary of the Taiyue February Guerrilla War: In February, some of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Tongpu were transferred west to invade Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. The Taiyue militia and guerrillas cooperated to defend Yan'an and launched an exceptionally active guerrilla war in the middle of the month. Under the slogan "Fight while dividing land," the militia and masses in various places expressed, "We will divide the land even if we lose our heads." In Jiyuan, County, Lingshi, Linfen and other places, the combination of guerrilla warfare and land reform started earlier. They are now carrying out land reform on the basis of resisting "counter-settlement" and are promoting it to backward areas. In the grid areas such as Xiangling, heroic struggles of dividing land while fighting against "encirclement and suppression" have begun. However, in most areas of the region, armed struggle is being used to open up the situation, conduct current affairs education, and launch political offensives. For example, the Fifth District of Yicheng used psychological warfare to defeat the puppet regime and won over twelve people including the village head and twenty-two people including puppet soldiers and their family members. In terms of tactics, the past hard-hitting and reckless fighting methods have been corrected, and tactics mainly based on explosions combined with sniping have been adopted to cover the masses to settle accounts and divide the land peacefully. In one month, Yicheng killed, wounded, and captured 124 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops at the cost of three minor injuries and one death, and a large number of guerrilla war heroes such as Zhang Baozhi and Hao Zhenhai emerged. Guerrilla teams in various places have also launched a new campaign to make meritorious contributions by annihilating the enemy. Guerrilla teams in Hongdong, Linfen, Quwo, Xiangling, Yicheng and other counties have successively penetrated deep behind enemy lines, competing to seize machine guns. In the last seven days of February, they seized four machine guns and once recovered Qulin Town, an important town in Quwo. In the Jinan triangle area of Wenxi, Fupan, and Jilu, Zhao Chuan's guerrilla team's tactics of advancing when the enemy advances and winning by surprise have been widely adopted. On the 12th, the Jilu militia battalion penetrated deep into the enemy's heartland in Fennan, including the areas of Xiazhuang, Longtou, and Hutou. They won three battles in five days, killing, wounding, and capturing 32 enemies. They once raided the Hutou stronghold without firing a single shot, captured 15 members of the revenge team alive, and seized one machine gun and ten rifles. When the guerrillas recovered Wangyukou and Yaotou, Chiang Kai-shek's 31st Brigade urgently mobilized 1,500 members of the "Love Hometown Corps" to reinforce and cooperated with the 164th Regiment of the 55th Brigade on the Jiangyuan line to attack us from both sides. However, they were constantly attacked along the way. The 31st Brigade advanced to Zhai Li in Xia County, and the 164th Regiment advanced to Hengyu northeast of Xia County and dared not move forward again. They were finally forced to retreat on the 22nd. In the Jinan area alone, more than 300 enemies were annihilated in the offensive in the second half of the month, and a large area was recovered.

    太岳游击战结合土地改革
    向敌占区纵深扩展
    【本报特讯】太岳二月游击战总结：二月同蒲蒋军部分西调，进犯陕甘宁，太岳民兵游击队配合保卫延安，于月中开始了异常活跃的游击战争。在“一面打仗一面分田”的号召下，各地民兵群众表示：“丢了头也要分地”。济源、县、灵石、临汾等地，游击战与土地改革的结合开始较早，现正在反“倒算”的基础上进行土地改革，并向落后地区推进。襄灵等格子网中，则开始了一面分田一面反清剿的英勇斗争。但全区绝大部分地区，则正以武装斗争打开局面，进行时事教育、政治攻势。如翼城五区以攻心战打垮伪政权，争取了编村团队长等十二人与伪军伪属二十二人。在战术方面，已纠正了过去猛打猛冲的硬干战法，采用了以爆炸为主配合冷枪的战术。掩护群众安心算账分田。翼城一个月中以轻伤三人牺牲一人的代价，杀伤俘蒋伪军一百二十四人，并出现了大批的游击战英雄如张保芝、郝振海等。各地游击队还展开了新的歼敌立功运动，洪洞、临汾、曲沃、襄灵、翼城等县游击队纷纷深入敌后，竞赛缴机枪。二月下旬七天中就缴了四挺机枪，并一度收复曲沃重镇曲林镇。在晋南三角地带闻喜、复盘、稷麓等地，普遍地发挥了赵川游击队敌进我进出奇制胜的战术。稷麓民兵营于十二日深入汾南敌人心脏之下庄、龙头、虎头一带，五天中三战三捷，毙伤俘敌三十二人，曾以急袭一枪未发的打入虎头据点，活捉复仇队十五人，缴机枪一挺步枪十支。当游击队收复王峪口、窑头时，蒋军三十一旅急调“爱乡团”千五百人增援，与绛垣线上的五五旅一六四团配合向我夹击。但沿途不断遭受打击，三十一旅进至夏县寨里，一六四团进至夏县东北横榆时即再不敢前进，终于二十二日被迫撤退。仅晋南地区在下半月的攻势中，就歼敌三百余人，恢复了广大地区。
