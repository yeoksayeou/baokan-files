　　Retired Soldier from Fengyi Voluntarily Gives Up Excess Gains
    Farmers Praise Him as "Pioneer of the Masses"
    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Rensuo, a retired soldier from Fengyi, Tunliu, actively led the masses to turn over a new leaf. Recently, in response to the call from higher authorities, he voluntarily handed over sixteen extra houses, twenty-six mu of land, twenty-seven yuan in cash (equivalent to forty-eight shi of rice), and one mule to fill in the "Gedaohao" (a local term, likely referring to land leveling or filling in a ditch). Influenced by his actions, nine other retired soldiers also gave up their excess gains. At the celebration of turning over a new leaf, everyone praised them for not being selfish, and awarded all the retired soldiers a large banner with the inscription "Pioneer of the Masses." The district farmers' association issued each of them a certificate and a silver medal for "turning-over-a-new-leaf hero."

　　丰仪荣退军人自让多得果实
    农民誉为“群众先锋”
    【本报讯】屯留丰仪荣退军人李仁锁，积极领导群众翻身，近为响应上级号召，把多得的房子十六间、地二十六亩、现洋二十七元折米四十八石、骡子一头，均自动拿出填了圪道。在他的影响下，九个荣退军人也都让出多得果实。在庆祝翻身大会上，大家认为他们不自私自利，奖给全体荣退军人大旗一杆，旗上写着“群众的先锋”。区农会发给每人奖状一张，翻身英雄银牌一个。
