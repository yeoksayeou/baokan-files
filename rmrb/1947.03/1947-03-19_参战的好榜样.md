　　Good Examples of Participating in the War

　　In the dark night, the troops and militia were fiercely fighting the enemy outside the village. Gao Dezi alone was responsible for guarding sixty-one prisoners. The enemy's shells landed frantically in the nearby yards and houses, and the prisoners in the houses rioted, using the excuse of needing to relieve themselves to run out of the yard. Dezi, in his anxiety, had a flash of inspiration. On the one hand, he threatened them with his gun, saying, "We won't be polite, we won't be responsible if you are killed for causing trouble!" On the other hand, he gestured to the sentries on the gate and roof to pay attention. After driving the prisoners back into the house, he looked at the street and there was no one to be seen. He was a little anxious, thinking, "If these bad guys escape, it will not only increase the enemy's strength, but the troops will have worked in vain." He made up his mind that he would rather die than let them run away. He also thought, "It's worth it if an enemy comes and I kill one." Later, he lined the prisoners up in two rows, and he followed closely behind, saying, "There are landmines everywhere in the village, so don't dare to walk around randomly," and along the way he kept shouting "Attention, be careful." In this way, he safely escorted the prisoners to the rear.

　　During the battle of Mafang, at the critical moment of fierce fighting, the troops ran out of hand grenades. Kang Weide, a model participant in the war, hurriedly and voluntarily mobilized the militia for hand grenades, but they were unwilling to give them. Weide said, "We carry hand grenades to eliminate the enemy. Giving them to the troops will have a greater effect than if we used them." After receiving the supply of grenades, the troops took down the blockhouse in one go. After the battle, the troops specially awarded them two "submachine guns," twenty-seven rifles, and one pistol.

　　Once, the day before the troops were to operate in Yukecun, the enemy surrounded them from behind. Gao Dezi immediately told the troops to retreat quickly. Relying on his familiarity with the terrain, he immediately hid. When the enemy advanced to within forty or fifty meters, he aimed three shots and killed two enemies. The enemy counterattacked, and Dezi threw two more hand grenades and turned to run. When the enemy chased to Yulutou Village, our troops had already ambushed them, killing more than twenty enemies in one go and driving the enemy back to Yuanshi City.

　　During the participation in the war on the Bai-Jin Line, some militiamen were unwilling to help the masses with production. Weide mobilized them, saying, "Let's think about how the Eighth Route Army helped us with production when they first arrived? The masses here live a hard life, and it is a newly liberated area. Is it right for us not to help with production?" After unifying everyone's thinking, they would help the masses carry manure, plow the land, and pull the plow as soon as they rested. The masses sent them a lot of white flour and vegetables, and said, "The militia are really good, and they endure hardship." In the war, Gao Dezi took the time to carry out propaganda to the masses. His method was to first help the masses, and start by talking about the pain of housework and life, so that they gradually understood that the participating militia and the masses were one family. Then he promoted the benefits and policies and laws of the old liberated areas, otherwise the masses would not like to listen.

### 参战的好榜样

　　参战的好榜样
    黑夜，部队和民兵在村外与敌激烈的战斗着，高德子一人担负了看守六十一个俘虏的任务。敌人的炮弹，疯狂的落在附近的院里房上，屋里的俘虏们乱起来，借口大小便，跑出院来。德子心急智生，一面用枪威吓说：“咱可不客气，你们要乱打死可不负责！”一面指手划脚叫门上房上的岗哨注意。把俘虏赶进屋后，到街上一看，一个人影也没有。他心里有些着急，心想：“这些坏家伙要是跑了，不只增加敌人力量，部队也算白辛苦了。”他下了决心，死也不能让他们跑一个。又想：“敌人如来打死一个也够本。”后来，把俘虏排成两行，他紧跟在后面说：“村里到处是地雷，不敢乱走，”沿途又连喊“注意，小心”。这样，把俘虏安全的带到后方。
    打马坊时，正在激烈战斗的紧要关头，部队打完了手榴弹，参战模范康维德急忙自动向民兵动员手榴弹，但都不愿给，维德说：“咱带手榴弹为的是消灭敌人，给了部队，比咱起作用还要大。”部队得到这批炸弹的接济，一股劲打下了炮楼。战斗结束后，部队特奖给他们两支“冲锋机”，二十七支步枪，一支短枪。
    一次，部队到鱼科村活动的头一天，敌人就从后面包围过来，高德子便让部队赶快退下，他凭借自己地形熟悉，立即隐蔽起来，当敌人进到四五十米远处，他瞄准三枪打死两敌，敌又反扑过来，德子又打了两个手榴弹，转身就跑。敌追到榆路头村时，我部队早已埋伏好，一气打死敌二十余名，将敌赶回元氏城。
    白晋线参战中，有些民兵不愿帮助群众生产，维德动员说：“咱们想想八路军刚到时是怎样帮助咱们生产来？这地方群众生活苦，又是新解放区，咱们不帮助生产对不对？”打通大家思想后，都一休息就给群众担粪、刨地、人拉犁地。群众送他们很多白面、蔬菜，并反映说：民兵真是好，又吃苦。高德子在参战中，并抽时间向群众宣传，办法是：先帮助群众，并从家务痛苦生活谈起，使其逐渐了解参战民兵和群众是一家人，然后宣传老解放区的好处和政策法令，不然群众不爱听。
