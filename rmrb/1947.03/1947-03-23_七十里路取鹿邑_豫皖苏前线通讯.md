    Taking Luyi After Seventy Li
    Frontline Dispatches from the Yu-Wan-Su Region

    On January 31st, we braved the moonlit night for seventy li to reach Luyi. At dawn on February 1st, we occupied the four gates of Luyi. At 4:30 in the afternoon, before the enemy planes had left, we began a fierce attack, and within half an hour, we occupied the city. One battalion of the Chiang army's 75th Division still attempted to resist stubbornly. Comrade Xi Jinwu, who was good at organizing firepower, used the grenade launcher with a spirit level and the rifle grenades on the Type 99 rifles that the Chiang army's 140th Brigade had "gifted" to us, giving them a lesson. In an instant, they followed the example of the garrison commander Ji Sun and surrendered all their weapons.

    Facing the evening glow, the first group to leave the city were the prisoners, one hand holding shackles, the other touching their waistbands, happily muttering, "I can see the sky! I can see the sky!" Some stared at the sky, as if they were afraid of losing this patch of blue sky again.

    The second group was over three thousand prisoners marching out in formation. Among them, eighteen hundred were new recruits from the 75th Division, some only having put on a grey uniform. In the group of prisoners, County Magistrate Sun Jingxuan and his foreign-style wife, Fan Zhenjue, appeared particularly timid, their heads hanging down weakly. I thought: they are probably missing their small kitchen. I had been to their small kitchen and seen it contained Jiangyaozhu, sea cucumber, shark fin, lily bulbs, Jianlian seeds, Japanese miso, Taiwanese snow sugar... It will be difficult for them to eat these things again. I asked him, "Do you know the burden on the people of Luyi County?" He shook his head and said, "One wave is not over, and another wave comes, I don't know either, you have to ask the people below!" The county magistrate probably loved to perform operas; his wife dressed like an opera actress; two opera troupes lived on either side of his hall, and there was also a brand new set of opera costumes and gongs and drums. These were all confiscated by our Forward Drama Troupe.

    Finally, amidst the sound of military music, our ×××× troops, who had made meritorious contributions in the city's capture, marched out of the city in neat steps. The soldiers were excitedly carrying the newly captured three heavy machine guns, twenty light machine guns, eight hundred rifles, one hundred thousand rounds of ammunition, twenty warhorses, and two hundred sabers. All other uncleared firearms, ammunition, flour, and other assets were handed over to the discipline inspection team and the materials collection team for safekeeping. The attacking troops all withdrew outside the city, and merchants and residents paid them surprised attention.

    One hour after the end of the battle, the troops did not commit the slightest offense, and order was maintained on the streets. This was an experience that the people of Luyi County had never had before. Many merchants and residents exclaimed, "We have never seen such a good army!" (Tian Bing)

    七十里路取鹿邑
    豫皖苏前线通讯
    一月三十一日，我们冒着七十里路的月夜赶到鹿邑。二月一号的黎明，占领了鹿邑四关。下午四时半，敌人的飞机还没有走，我们便开始了猛烈的攻击，半小时的战斗，占领了该城。蒋军七五师的一个营还企图顽抗。我善于组织火力的郄晋武同志，便把蒋军一四○旅“送”给我们的带水平气泡的掷弹筒和九九式步枪上的枪榴弹，使他们领教了。刹那之间，他们也仿效着守将纪荪，全部缴了枪。
    迎着夕霞，第一批出城的是一手提着镣铐，一手摸着裤腰，嘴里喜欢的唠叨着“可见到天了！可见到天了！”的囚犯们。他们有的凝视着天空，好像诚恐头顶上这块蓝天再失掉了似的。
    第二批是整队出城的三千多名俘虏。内有一千八百名是七五师训练的新兵，有的才穿上件灰大衣。在俘虏群里，县长孙敬轩和他的洋里洋气的太太范贞珏，显得格外胆怯，他们无力的垂着头。我想：他们大概是在怀念小厨房。我曾经到他们小厨房里看过，里面有江ｙáｏ＠①柱、海参、沙鱼肚、百合、建莲子、东洋面酱、台湾雪糖……他们再想吃这些东西，是困难了。我问他：“你知道鹿邑县人民的负担吗？”他摇一下头说：“一波未完，一波又来，我也不知道，得问下面！”县长大概是很爱唱戏的，他的老婆打扮的很像戏子，他的大堂两边住着两班戏子，还有一套崭新的戏衣和锣鼓。这些，都被我们的前进剧社缴来了。
    最后，在一片军乐声里，我们攻城有功的××××部队，迈着整齐的步伐出城。战士们兴奋地，携带着新缴的三挺重机枪、二十挺轻机枪、八百条步枪、十万发子弹、二十匹战马、二百把马刀。其他一切尚未清出的枪械子弹、面粉及其他资财，一律交纪律检查组及物资收容队看管。攻城部队全部撤出城外，商民向他们行着惊奇的注目礼。
    结束战斗一小时，部队秋毫无犯，大街上秩序井然，这在鹿邑县人民的心里，是从来没有的经验。多少商民惊叹着：“我们从来没有见过这样好的军队呀！”（田兵）
