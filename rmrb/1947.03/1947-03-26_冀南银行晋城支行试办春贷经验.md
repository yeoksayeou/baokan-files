The Jinan Bank Jincheng Branch, in order to ensure that this year's spring loans truly support mass production, specifically used the Southwest Tianshi area as a base for trial implementation, and gained some experience: (1) Solving the ideological problems of cadres and the masses: The main difficulty in Southwest Tianshi is the lack of livestock. When doing loan work, individual conversations with cadres and meetings revealed these thoughts: The loans are too small, the price of livestock is high, and it won't solve any problems. Dispersed loans won't be effective, and lending to a few households may offend those who don't get loans. Natural villages are very scattered, and every village cadre wants to get some loans for their village. Some cadres want to lend money carelessly, and if they can't buy livestock, they can engage in other production. After discovering these thoughts, several specific methods were adopted to solve them: (1) Repeatedly explaining that bank loans can only play a supporting and helping role in production, and that the main thing is to rely on the strength of the masses. If livestock are lacking, a plan should be drawn up to gradually solve the problem through production surpluses. If the strength is insufficient when solving the problem, the bank can help. In this way, some cadres became clear, and they said: "Right! This year we must mobilize the masses to accumulate capital and combine it with bank loans to solve the livestock problem." Who should be lent to? A discussion and research was launched at the cadre meeting, combined with the review of land reform, and it was discovered that whoever has the greatest difficulty in agricultural production should be lent to. (2) Conduct extensive publicity among the masses to allow them to freely discuss. As a result, it was found that the masses had the following thoughts: Some of the masses have confused thoughts and low production enthusiasm, and there is a "proud to be poor" mentality. Some of the masses, although they have been liberated, have not built a foundation, and are afraid that they will not be able to repay the loans in the autumn if they borrow too much. Some people have money to buy livestock, but they are afraid that others will say they are rich peasants. Some people are afraid that if they buy livestock, they will be organized into mutual aid groups for everyone to use, and so on. These thoughts are all obstacles to production, so policy education was conducted among the masses to explain that loans are to help everyone establish a solid foundation for prosperity. This dispelled the masses' ideological concerns and further helped them make production plans. (2) How to distribute the funds? (1) Focus on those who have newly gained land but lack animal power, lack production tools, and have difficult family circumstances, especially taking care of military dependents and honorably retired soldiers without a production base. The amount of the loan should be used in a concentrated way to solve the difficulties of farmers in production, oppose average dispersion, and oppose the transfer of use. (2) First, let the masses report the amount of money they need and its purpose, divide them into groups for mutual evaluation, and then democratically elect impartial people in the village to form a supervisory committee. According to the opinions of the groups and based on the principle of the size of the family's difficulties, determine who should be lent to and how much should be lent, re-evaluate, and then announce it to the masses for approval. (3) After the loan amounts are assessed, the borrowers are organized into loan groups (based on mutual aid groups), and repayment plans are formulated for phased zero repayments. This not only enables the borrowers to guarantee repayment to each other, but also promotes production plans and encourages mutual competition through loans.

    冀南银行晋城支行试办春贷经验
    冀南银行晋城支行为使今年的春贷真正能扶植群众生产，特以西南田石为基点试办，取得一些经验：（一）解决干部与群众的思想问题：西南田石主要困难是缺少牲口，做贷款工作时，在和干部个别谈话与会议中，发现这些思想：贷款太少，牲口价高，解决不了什么问题。分散贷款起不到作用，贷给几户又怕得罪了贷不上的人。自然村很分散，那个村干部也想给自己村贷些。有些干部想马马虎虎贷些款，不能买牲口也搞些别的生产。发现这些思想后，便采取了几种具体办法进行解决：（１）反复说明银行贷款对生产只能起扶持与帮助作用，主要应靠群众力量，如牲口缺少，只有订出计划逐渐在生产积余中求得解决，解决时如力量不足，银行可以帮助。这样，有些干部就明确了，他们说：“对！今年咱们要好好动员群众积资，结合银行贷款来解决牲口问题。”应贷给谁？在干部会议上展开讨论研究，结合翻身检查，发现谁在农业生产中困难最大就贷给谁。（２）在群众中进行广泛宣传，让群众自由酝酿。结果发现群众有如下思想：部分群众思想混乱生产情绪低，存在着“以贫为荣”思想，有些群众虽是翻了身但因没打下基础，怕贷的多了秋后还不起；有些有钱买牲口，又怕别人说他是富农；有些人怕买上牲口组织到互助组里大家用等等。这些思想都是生产的障碍，因此便在群众中进行政策教育，说明贷款是帮助大家扎富根，这样解除群众思想顾虑，并进一步帮助群众作生产计划。（二）款子怎样放下去？（１）以新翻身得地而无畜力，生产工具缺乏，家境困难者为主要对象，特别是照顾军干属及生产无基础的荣退军人。贷款数目要集中使用，以解决农民生产中的困难，反对平均分散，反对转移用途。（２）首先让群众自报需款数及用途，划分小组互相评议，再由群众民主选出村中公正人士组成监察委员会，根据小组意见，按家庭困难大小为原则，确定谁该贷，该贷多少，复评后再向群众宣布，由群众批准。（３）贷款数目评定后，将贷款人编成贷款小组（以互相组为基础），分别订出分期零还的归还计划，这样不但使贷款户可以互相保证归还，而且通过贷款推动生产计划，鼓励互相竞赛。
