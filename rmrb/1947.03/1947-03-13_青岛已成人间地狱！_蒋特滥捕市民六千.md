　　Qingdao Has Become a Living Hell!
    Chiang Kai-shek's Special Agents Indiscriminately Arrest 6,000 Citizens
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] The fascist terror of mass arrests by the Chiang government has spread to Qingdao. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Qingdao on the 10th, 5,000 Kuomintang military police conducted a surprise midnight "household registration check," and 6,000 Chinese citizens were arrested.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] According to the Chongqing Dagong Bao on the 3rd and 5th, sugarcane farmers in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, petitioned the county government on January 18th due to the unfair official assessment of sugarcane prices. Police opened fire, killing and injuring more than 20 people. The masses were outraged and destroyed the county government. Afterwards, the authorities even called the farmers "traitorous parties," arrested the chairman of the farmers' association and more than 20 farmers, subjected them to torture, and forced them to pay bribes of 7 million yuan, but they have not been released. A Kuomintang special agent agency was stationed on the upper floor of a house at 19 Sangdi Street in Hejiang County, playing cards and singing operas every day, which greatly disturbed the resident surnamed Hu on the lower floor. On the first day of the lunar new year, when the Hu family was having a dinner, dirty water from upstairs dripped into the Hu family's vegetable bowl. The Hu's son slightly reproached them, and he was immediately labeled as a "rebellious party" and immediately detained.

    【新华社延安十日电】据三、五两日渝大公报披露，四川资中县蔗农因官方对蔗价评议不公，一月十八日向县府请愿，被警察开枪毙伤二十余人，群情激愤捣毁县府，事后当局竟谓农民为“奸党”，逮捕农会理事长及农民二十余人，非刑拷打，并迫令贿赂七百万元，迄未释放。合江县城桑地街十九号房屋楼上，驻有国民党特务机关某部，每天打牌唱戏，楼下住民胡姓不胜其扰。旧历元旦，胡姓老幼聚餐时，楼上倾倒脏水滴入胡姓菜碗中，胡姓之子略加责备，即被彼冀指为“逆党”，立予拘押。
