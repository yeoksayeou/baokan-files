　　The Merit Campaign of the Bo'ai Army and People
    Yan Xin
    Since December of last year, the merit campaign in the fourth sub-district of the Taihang region has been relatively successful, greatly promoting the development of guerrilla warfare, local work in the guerrilla areas, and the improvement of relations between the army and the local people in Bo'ai County.

    The first key to Bo'ai's campaign was to strengthen the unified leadership of the entire county's Party, government, army, and people. The county Party secretary and the county head were not merely formally concurrently serving as political commissar and commander of the independent battalion. Instead, at the very beginning of launching the merit campaign, they personally went deep into the companies to specifically understand and resolve the ideological problems and practical difficulties within the troops. They helped the commanders and fighters understand the war situation and mobilized everyone to discuss it; if some comrades had personal problems, they helped to solve them or to work through their thinking; if the troops were understaffed, had difficulties with grain and money, lacked ammunition, or were short of shoes, they could discover the problems in a timely manner and mobilize the local people to solve them quickly. In this way, they first enhanced the troops' sincere love for the local Party and government organs and the people, and resolved the thinking of some commanders and fighters who felt that the local people did not care about the troops. This achieved unity of thought and harmonious feelings, laying a solid foundation for the merit campaign.

    Next was in-depth merit mobilization. First, the cadres were organized to deliberate, so that each comrade understood the glory of performing meritorious service for the people and the leadership methods of the mass line, as well as the great role of cadres taking the lead. Then, the soldiers in the platoons and squads were presented with the idea of "everyone performing meritorious service, striving to become heroes supported by the masses after the liberation of northern Henan," dispelling the passive emotions of some soldiers who believed that "small soldiers cannot perform great feats" and "just do what they are told." The slogan quickly combined with each individual's desire for progress and hope for a greater future, forming a great force.

    After mobilization, each unit, and even individuals, were then organized to formulate their own plans for killing the enemy and performing meritorious service, and mutual challenges and competitions were launched. At the beginning, some units' plans were too high, and the leadership guided everyone to clarify the viewpoints of "long-term focus, starting from reality, gradually improving, and accumulating small victories into great victories." Finally, each unit formulated realistic plans based on the most practical situation and challenged each other.

    After the independent battalion issued the challenge, everyone from cadres to soldiers became tense. The battalion and company quickly selected merit committees, and the mood of the troops changed greatly. Some soldiers were determined to capture two enemies and obtain two guns within a month. Some even wanted to capture three by themselves. Soldiers challenged each other privately, using a pencil, a small notebook, or other things as trophies. Performing meritorious service truly became a mass movement.

    On January 9, the Fifth District took the lead in capturing an enemy investigator from the Henan North Office who had previously served as a puppet platoon leader in Guitun, seizing seventy or eighty catties of salt. The leadership promptly publicized and praised this, which immediately encouraged the entire county. On the 11th, the first company of the independent battalion, in conjunction with the Fifth District, attacked Guitun, capturing five enemies and obtaining one machine gun and five rifles. The soldiers who were being trained in various districts heard the news and demanded to go down the mountain to operate as soon as possible. At this point, a county-wide movement was vigorously launched.

    On the 19th, the Second and Third Districts ambushed the Jiaoqing Highway, killing an enemy squad leader and seizing ten head of livestock and twenty barrels of kerosene. The militia second team also seized twenty-two head of livestock, and on the 23rd, captured three more enemies. The public security team also captured two. Everyone's enthusiasm became higher and higher, and the soldiers often went down the mountain before dawn to lie in ambush.

    After a month of activities, each district successfully completed its tasks, and the independent battalion also captured officers above the rank of captain. The troops were unprecedentedly consolidated, and the phenomenon of desertion was completely eliminated. Some soldiers who were previously ideologically backward also gradually became active. They personally experienced the power of their own strength, and after hearing the prisoners say that the puppet army only ate two meals of corn a day, their thinking changed greatly, and they also enthusiastically demanded to perform meritorious service.

    In the competition to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service, their leadership methods were: First, organizing units to act in coordination. When attacking Liu Guoding's puppet district office troops, the martial arts team gave him a sudden surprise attack on the first day, chasing him for several miles. Knowing that he would retaliate, the martial arts team called the troops to go together the next day. When the enemy came out, the martial arts team attacked first. Thinking it was just the militia, the enemy fought hard. Our troops pounced up in an instant, scattering the enemy in all directions, even causing them to jump into the river to escape. Attacking Sujiazhuang, Xijiegou, and Xiashuimo were all successful examples of coordinated action.

    Second, combining armed activities with local work. There were local personnel in each armed force. When attacking the enemy, they would strike accurately if they could, and if they couldn't, they would hold mass meetings or do other local work in various villages. They captured many puppet office personnel and reformed many puppet village governments. Many villages bordering the enemy were able to implement government orders and hold celebrations of victory. Some landlords in the city contacted us, and some major despots fled to Xinxiang; those who stubbornly resisted by relying on enemy power (such as the landlord of Sujiazhuang) were resolutely attacked to bring them to submission. Now the enemy dares not harass even the earthen fortresses and Guitun near the city.

    Third, unifying and appropriately adjusting the use of local and military cadres to overcome difficulties on both sides in a timely manner and exchange experiences. Cadres transferred from the local area to the troops have now served as deputy company commanders and branch secretaries.

    Fourth, promptly commending models and establishing banners. Liu Chengshan, the seventh squad leader of the second company, was commended by the battalion for his heroic combat, and after the Liu Chengshan movement was called for, a group of even more outstanding heroes of killing the enemy, such as Gang Kaoshan, Zhao Zunlun, Li Lusu, Li Yong, and platoon leader Du Shibao, emerged, promoting the entire movement. This made the work of promoting cadres proceed smoothly. Units that suffered failures were not criticized directly but were guided to review the reasons.

    Fifth, the mass line of evaluating and recording merits. All merits were recorded only after being judged and recognized by everyone. The soldiers said: "In the past, those who were good at talking took advantage, but now no one can bury the merits of those who have done good work, and no one can falsely report those who have not."

    Sixth, the masses supervise the leadership and promote a democratic style. Individual cadres who scolded soldiers were immediately subjected to benevolent and positive corrections by the soldiers, overcoming complaining behind their backs, and the troops were unprecedentedly united.

　　博爱军民的立功运动
    雁心
    去年十二月以来，太行四分区的立功运动，作得比较有成绩，而博爱军民在开展游击战争、开展游击区地方工作以及改善部队与地方关系各方面，都起了极大的推动作用。
    博爱开展这一运动的第一个关键，是强化全县党政军民的一元化领导。县委书记与县长不是形式的兼任独立营政委与营长，而是在开始发动立功运动之初，即亲自深入连队，具体了解与解决部队内部的思想问题与实际困难。他们帮助指战员们了解战争形势，并发动大家讨论；有些同志有个人问题，即帮助其解决或打通思想；部队不满员，粮款有困难，子弹不够，缺鞋，都能及时的发现问题并发动地方予以迅速解决。这样，首先提高了部队，对地方党政机关与人民更真诚的热爱，解决了部分指战员认为地方不关心部队的思想。做到了思想一致、感情融洽，给立功运动打下坚实基础。
    接着是深入的立功动员。首先在干部中组织酝酿，使每个同志认识了为人民立功的光荣与群众路线的领导方法，干部带头的巨大作用等。然后向班排战士提出“人人立功、争取豫北解放后都成为群众拥戴的英雄”，打通部分战士中认为“当小兵立不下大功”与“叫怎就怎”的被动情绪。口号与各人要求进步，要求有更大前途的希望迅速结合起来，形成一种很大力量。
    动员之后，接着就组织各单位甚至个人都自订杀敌立功计划，并发动互相挑战竞赛。一开始有的单位计划太高，领导上引导大家明确“长期着眼、从实际出发、逐步提高、积小胜为大胜”的观点。最后各单位根据最实际情况都订出切实计划，互相挑战。
    独立营提出挑战后，从干部到战士一齐紧张起来。营连迅速选出立功委员会，部队情绪起了很大变化。有些战士下决心要在一月内捉敌二名，得枪二枝。有的甚至一人要捉三个。战士们私下自己挑战，以一支铅笔、一个小本或其他东西为锦标。立功真正成了群众运动。
    一月九日，五区抢先在贵屯捉回曾任伪连长的敌豫北办事处调查员，缴获食盐七八十斤。领导上抓紧通报表扬，立刻鼓舞了全县。十一日，独立营一连结合五区袭击贵屯，俘敌五人，得机枪一挺，长短枪五支。各区正在整训的战士们闻讯，都要求赶快下山活动。至此，全县性运动蓬勃展开。
    十九日，二、三区小伏击焦清公路，毙敌班长一、缴牲口十头、煤油二十筒。民兵二队亦缴获牲口二十二头，二十三日，再捉敌三名。公安队亦捉到两个。大家情绪越来越高，战士们往往天不明就摸下山去埋伏起来。
    经过一个月活动，各区均胜利完成任务，独立营也捉到尉级以上军官。部队空前巩固，逃亡现象完全消灭了。从前思想上有些落后的战士个别也都逐渐积极起来，他们亲身体验到自己力量的强大，又听到俘虏诉说伪军中一天两顿吃玉茭，思想大变，也热烈要求立功。
    在杀敌立功竞赛中，他们的领导方法是：第一，组织各单位协同动作。打伪区署刘国定部时，头一天武工队打他个猛不防，追了他好几里。武工队知道他要报复，第二天就叫着部队一同去。敌人出来，武工队先打，敌以为又是民兵，便硬打起来。我部队刹那间扑了上去，把敌人打了个四散奔命，甚至跳河而逃。打苏家庄、西界沟、下水磨，都是协同动作的成功。
    第二，武装活动与地方工作结合。各武装部队中都有地方人员。袭敌时，摸准了就打，摸不住就在各村开群众大会或做其他地方工作。他们活捉了好多伪办公人员，改造了许多伪村政权。许多接敌村庄均能政令通行，开庆祝胜利大会。有些入城地主找我接头，有的大恶霸逃往新乡；有的仗敌势顽抗（如苏家庄地主），则坚决打击，使其就范。现在敌人连城边的土屯、贵屯都不敢去骚扰。
    第三，地方与部队干部统一使用，适当调剂，及时克服双方困难，并能交流经验。由地方调到部队的干部，现已有任副连长、支书的。
    第四，及时表扬模范、树立旗帜。二连七班长刘成善英勇作战，受到营的表扬，并号召刘成善运动后，接着便出现了更杰出的罡靠山、赵尊伦、李陆宿、李勇及排长杜世宝等一批杀敌英雄，推动了整个运动。并使提拔干部工作顺利进行。有的单位遭到失败，也不正面批评，而引导他们检讨原因。
    第五，群众路线的评功记功。凡记功都是大家评判公认了的。战士们说：“从前会说的人就占便宜，现在谁有功劳也埋没不了，没功劳也假报不了。”
    第六，群众监督领导，发扬民主作风。有个别干部骂战士，立即受到战士们善意的正面纠正，克服了背后发牢骚，部队空前的团结。
