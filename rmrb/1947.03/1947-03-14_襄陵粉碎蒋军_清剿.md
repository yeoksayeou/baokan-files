(This article transmitted by) Taiyue, 12th (of the month): The army and people of Xiangling have once again smashed the Chiang army's "encirclement and suppression." On the 23rd of last month, a regiment of the Chiang army's 90th Division set out from Linfen in three routes to encircle and suppress the central area of ​​Ta'er Mountain, less than three miles from the Eastern Garden of Xiangling. They were constantly resisted by our army and civilians along the way and suffered considerable casualties. A certain village militia used a cold gun at Shibapan to destroy an enemy mortar and kill seven enemy company platoon leaders and below, and wound four. Local guerrillas also carried out activities deep into the Chiang-occupied area on the evening of the 27th, destroying transportation and attacking enemy military transport. After five days and nights of hard fighting by the local army and people, the Chiang army was finally completely repelled on the 28th. This time, the Chiang army was extremely vicious in its intentions, attempting to destroy the Xiangling Liberated Area. All the masses who were captured were taken away, and even the elderly, weak, women and children were not spared. However, the people of Xiangling resolutely resisted the Chiang army's "encirclement and suppression." A worker in Nanshan was captured by the Chiang army and forced to lead the way to the kiln to capture the masses hiding in the kiln. He deliberately tilted his head and extinguished the lights, and slipped into a deep ditch. The Chiang army grabbed another old man and asked him to go down to the kiln to find people, and told him, "The Central Army is gone, come up quickly!" But he shouted loudly, "The Central Army is here!" so that the people in the kiln could prepare in advance.

　　襄陵粉碎蒋军“清剿”
    【本报太岳十二日电】襄陵军民又一次粉碎蒋军“清剿”。上月二十三日，蒋军九十师一个团自临汾分三路向襄陵东方园不足川里的塔儿山中心地区清剿，沿途遭我军民不断阻击颇有伤亡。某村民兵在十八盘以冷枪击毁敌迫击炮一门，炸死敌营排班长以下七名，伤四名。地方游击队并于廿七日晚深入蒋占区活动，破坏交通，袭击敌军运输，经当地军民五昼夜之苦斗，终于二十八日将蒋军全部击退。此次蒋军用心毒辣，企图毁灭襄陵解放区，凡被抓之群众，都被带走，老弱妇孺亦难幸免。但襄陵人民坚决反抗蒋军“清剿”，南山一个工人被蒋军抓住，强迫他带路下窑捉捕藏在窑内的群众，他故意将头一歪，熄灭灯火，溜下深沟。蒋军抓住另一个老汉下窑找人，并叫他说：“中央军走了，快上来吧！”但他却大声喊叫：“中央军来了！”使窑下的人能预为准备。
