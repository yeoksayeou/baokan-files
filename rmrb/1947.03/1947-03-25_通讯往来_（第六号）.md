    To all branch offices, reporters, and correspondents:

    The People's Daily's front-page lead story on March 20th, second edition, "Solving the Rift Between Cadres and the Masses: Two Fears Turned into Two Smiles," and the front-page lead story on March 21st, first edition, "Anyang Militia Restores Vast Villages," are worthy of everyone's study. Their characteristic is that they specifically and vividly report the process of a piece of work. The former reports the process of resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, and the latter reports the process of carrying out the militia meritorious service campaign. What we lack most in the manuscripts we receive every day are reports on the work process. They only say what was done, but not how it was done, how to mobilize honest farmers, only saying how many were mobilized, but not what steps were taken. They write that cadres returned excessive gains, only saying how much was returned, but not how to guide them, how to solve ideological problems. Therefore, others cannot learn from it, and the guiding role is not great. A report on the process is to write out the path taken to achieve a kind of result, and its experience is most convenient for others to learn. It is hoped that everyone will study the above two drafts and pay attention to writing more about the work process.

    通讯往来  （第六号）
    各分社、记者、通讯员：
    人民日报三月二十日二版头条“干群疙瘩解开两个怕变成两个笑”，及二十一日一版头条“安阳民兵恢复广大村庄”值得大家学习，其特点是具体生动地报导了一个工作的过程，前者报导了解决干群关系的过程，后者报导了开展民兵立功运动的过程。我们每天所收到的来稿中比较缺少的就是关于工作过程的报导，只说做了什么，却不说如何做的，如何发动老实农民，只说发动了多少，不说经过什么步骤，写了干部退出多得果实，只说退了多少东西，不说如何引导、如何解决思想问题，因此，别人无法学习，指导作用也不大。写过程的报导就是写出达到一种成绩所经过的道路，其经验也最便于别人学习。希望大家研究上述两稿，注意多写工作过程。            晋冀鲁豫新华总分社
