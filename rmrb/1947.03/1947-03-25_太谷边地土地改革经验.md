    Taigu Border Area Land Reform Experience
    Taigu County Party Committee
    After three months of arduous struggle from mid-November of last year to mid-February of this year, 93 villages in the Taigu border area have launched the land reform movement, and more than ten villages have completed it thoroughly. The leading experience has the following points:
  (1) Overcoming Several Thoughts Hindering the Movement
    In the beginning, many cadres were only single-mindedly fighting, believing that as long as they could win a few battles, the situation would change, and that land reform was not important. Or they thought that land reform was a matter for the later turn-over teams and shirked their responsibilities. This resulted in the loss of many favorable opportunities, resulting in cadres and militiamen dancing naked. Another thought was the fear of creating a red-white confrontation, of scaring away landlords, and of undermining the anti-Yan united front. Still others believed that only rent and interest reduction could be implemented in the border area.
    To overcome these erroneous ideas, we cited many facts: for example, a village that mobilized the masses to carry out land reform also did a good job in guerrilla warfare, which greatly enlightened those who neglected land reform. The landlord in Podi, Fourth District, defected to the enemy without struggle, as did Nan Zhang. Many fugitive landlords had not been struggled against or had not been thoroughly struggled against; while in villages where the struggle was truly thorough, the landlords bowed their heads to the masses and no longer defected to the enemy. These facts broke the idea of fearing red-white confrontation. Everyone realized that the red-white confrontation was not due to land reform, but to the past work style of some comrades in the occupied areas of grabbing everything at once.
  (2) Pushing the Focus of Enemy-Our Struggle Forward, Implementing Land Reform in the Rear
    The Fourth District focused the enemy-our struggle on the Beizhang and Nanshen areas, three to five miles around the enemy strongholds. Then, seizing the opportunity, it drew cadres to intensively train poor peasants in large numbers in the rear, raising their class consciousness by telling of their sufferings and tracing their roots of poverty, and breaking their worries about change by hating the landlords. Then they were organized to return to their villages to develop peasant associations, collude with poor peasants, unite with middle peasants, and struggle against the landlords. The main targets of struggle (mostly treacherous and domineering landlords) identified during the training were immediately detained to prevent the landlords from escaping upon hearing the news, which would affect the morale of the masses.
  (3) Establishing Order for Guerrilla Life in the Border Area
    The development of the land reform movement in Liujiazhuang first established three lines of defense and landmine blockades, and the retreat and transfer groups in the village were well-defined and arranged in order. The masses felt that they would not suffer losses even if the enemy came, and only then did the struggle begin. Jing Shen Village was an organized transfer to the mountains in the rear before the liquidation was launched. The treacherous and domineering landlords were managed by the masses who had been transferred in groups, which reassured the masses very much.
  (4) Vigorously Publicizing the Policy of "Land to the Tiller"
    In addition to mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, meetings should be specifically held with middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants to clearly announce that middle peasants will not be struggled against, so as to avoid panic. Podi and Zhaojiagou did not do this, and the special agents scared away many middle peasants by spreading rumors. For small and medium landlords, it should also be proposed that "escaping leaves behind sins, staying at home leaves behind a livelihood" to stabilize those who stay at home and win over those who escape. Jing Shen Village did this, and the landlords did not escape.
  (5) Quick Struggle, Quick Distribution, Trying to Achieve Democratic Discussion
    The distribution of fruits should be quick, and the class strata of the whole village must be divided in advance, and the levels should be divided according to the depth of the holes, and standards should be set. After the struggle, the distribution should be carried out immediately, and do not wait until the struggle is over before distributing. But try to strive for everyone to discuss it (even if it is a small group discussion), which will not delay time very much, and will also enable the opinions of the masses to be expressed, prevent corruption and injustice and theft, enhance unity, and prevent landlords and special agents from taking advantage of it. Pang Village did not grasp the overall principle when distributing the fruits, and the village chief and director took care of it, and many properties were not distributed for a long time, which resulted in dissatisfaction among the masses, and even the masses who received the fruits were not active.

    太谷边地土地改革经验
    太谷县委会
    太谷边地经过去冬十一月中旬到今年二月中旬三个月的艰苦斗争，已有九十三村开展了土地改革运动，且有十余村已搞彻底。其领导经验有以下几点：
  （一）克服阻碍运动的几种思想
    开始时，许多干部只是单纯打仗，认为只要能打几个胜仗就能转变局面，土地改革做不做不关紧。或者认为土地改革是后面翻身队的事，推诿不做。曾因此失掉不少有利机会，造成干部民兵裸体跳舞。另一种思想是怕造成赤白对立，怕吓跑地主，破坏了反阎统一战线。还有是认为在边地只能实行减租减息。
    为克服这些错误思想，我们举出许多事实：如某村发动群众实行了土地改革，游击战争也开展的好，这给忽视土地改革者以很大启发。四区坡底地主未经斗争也投了敌，南张也是如此。许多逃亡地主，都是没有被斗或没有斗透；而真正斗争彻底的村庄，地主反而向群众低了头，不再投敌了。这些事实，把怕赤白对立的思想打破了。大家都认识到：赤白对立并非由于土地改革，而是我们过去部分同志在沦陷区乱抓一把的工作方式造成的。
  （二）把敌我争夺的焦点往前推，在后面实行土地改革
    四区把敌我斗争胶着在敌据点周围三、五里地的北张、南沈一带。然后抓紧时机，抽干部在后面大批集训贫苦农民，以诉苦追穷根提高其阶级觉悟，以对地主的仇恨打破变天顾虑，然后组织他们回村发展农会，串通贫农，团结中农，对地主斗争。训练中肯定了的主要斗争对象（多为奸霸地主），马上扣起来，以免地主闻风逃跑，影响群众情绪。
  （三）建立边地游击生活秩序
    刘家庄土地改革运动的开展，首先是建立了三道岗与地雷封锁，把村里退却转移的小组划好，次序排好，群众觉得敌人来也吃不了亏，这才开始了斗争。井神村是有组织的转移到后面山上才展开清算。奸霸地主被分组转移的群众管理起来，群众非常放心。
  （四）大力宣传耕者有其田政策
    除发动贫雇外，应专门召开中农与富裕中农的会议，明确宣布不斗中农，以免引起恐慌。坡底、赵家沟由于没这样做，特务一造谣就把许多中农吓跑了。对中小地主，也应提出“逃跑留罪恶、在家留生活”，以稳定在家者、争取逃跑者。井神村这样做了，地主便没有什么逃跑的。
  （五）快斗快分，尽量做到民主讨论
    分果实要快，必须事先把全村阶级阶层划分好，按洞深浅划分等级，订出标准。斗争出来，随手就进行分配，不要等斗完再分。但要尽量争取让大家讨论一下（小组讨论也好），既不很耽误时间，也使群众意见都能表达出来，防止贪污不公与偷窃现象，增强团结，不致显地主特务有所乘。庞村分果实时没掌握整个原则，村长、主任包办，好些财物迟迟不分，结果弄得群众不满，连分得果实的群众也不积极了。
