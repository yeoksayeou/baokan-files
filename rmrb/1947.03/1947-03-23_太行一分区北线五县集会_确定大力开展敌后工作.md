    Taihang First Military Sub-district's Northern Five Counties Meeting
    Determines to Vigorously Carry Out Work Behind Enemy Lines

    [Our Dispatch] In response to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call for a widespread guerrilla war, and to lay the foundation for the main force's operations and the recovery of lost territory, the county party secretaries, directors of the Armed Forces Committee, and responsible comrades of the independent battalions and the sub-district's backbone regiments from the five northern counties of Taihang First Military Sub-district – Gao (yi), Zan (huang), Yuan (shi), Huo (lu), and Jing (xing) – gathered from February 16th to 24th to study and unify the issue of fighting the enemy. The conference examined the insufficient understanding of the serious phenomenon of the creation of partial or complete no-man's-lands by the enemy, and recognized that the cadres' peaceful illusions had not been completely overcome and that work behind enemy lines had not yet taken root. It then determined that the overall policy for the future is to: remove obstacles to the unreserved development of guerrilla warfare, arm the whole people to vigorously carry out work behind enemy lines, oppose the plunder and conscription of the stubborn pseudo-regime, and launch a movement to protect fields, protect villages, and protect conscripts. Specific tasks and methods should be implemented by each county according to local conditions. These include: (1) eliminating the antagonism between red and white in the no-man's-lands and semi-no-man's-lands in the border areas, mobilizing the masses who are away from home to return, organizing joint defense to fight the enemy in a unified way, and persisting in the struggle to protect spring plowing and production; those who are unwilling to return should be organized to carry out production; (2) striving to get fleeing personnel to return home for production; the party, government, army, and people should be fully combined to resolutely crack down on the ringleaders of the returning reactionaries, and at the same time strive to disintegrate their secondary and coerced elements; (3) conducting in-depth activities behind enemy lines, vigorously carrying out work behind enemy lines, and paying attention to taking root and creating experience in legal and illegal struggles behind enemy lines, and organizing mass production; (4) continuing to mobilize the masses in the border areas, paying attention to not mechanically copying experience, and the troops should also participate; (5) continuing to carry out a widespread mass political propaganda war, publicizing the situation that we will surely win and Chiang will surely be defeated and our policies, in order to disintegrate the stubborn pseudo-army. To this end, joint defense command areas have been divided and personnel for the troops to participate in the county party committees have been determined (backbone regiments participate in the county party committee wherever they are located). Finally, a summary was made. In his summary, Deputy Political Commissar Ma of the sub-district pointed out that leading comrades should strengthen ideological guidance and overcome the cadres' fear of difficulties, trouble, and fatigue. Attention should be paid to arming the whole people, with the backbone regiments leading the local armed forces and militia, and the militia leading the self-defense forces, developing indigenous weapons and launching an explosion movement, and cultivating various experts and special shooters, and correcting tactics by changing from defense to offense. It is necessary to correct the phenomenon of being divorced from the masses, and to carry out a merit-making movement. The summary particularly emphasized the issue of the party's centralized leadership. He first pointed out that it is necessary to establish the idea of the party's unified leadership, eliminate the influence of each doing its own thing that affects unity, and recognize that being responsible to the party, to the masses, and to work is unified. Secondly, the leadership must study the experience of unifying forces, and the county party committee must carefully study the methods of combining the tasks assigned by the higher authorities with the work of the county. Third, organizationally, all work should be unified under the county party committee, with regular study of the guidelines, tasks, and policies. The county secretary should concurrently hold positions and power and reside in the troops, so that the command post truly becomes the executive organ of the county party committee. Finally, improve the relationship between the army and the local areas, respect, help, and learn from each other, and promote the spirit of self-criticism. The summary finally pointed out that the troops should strictly check mass discipline, save civilian manpower, promote combat initiative, and pay attention to combining combat with training to improve combat effectiveness. At present, the leading comrades have returned to their respective counties, and it is expected that the First Military Sub-district's struggle against the enemy will soon see a new development.
