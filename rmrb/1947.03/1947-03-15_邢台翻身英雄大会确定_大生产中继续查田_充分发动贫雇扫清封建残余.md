Land Distribution Must Be Equal; We Will Not Rest!
　　Xingtai Upsurge Hero Conference Confirmed
    Continuing Land Investigation During Great Production
    Fully Mobilizing Poor and Hired Peasants to Eliminate Feudal Remnants
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After two months of in-depth movement before and after the Lunar New Year, all 51 backward villages in Xingtai County have been broken through, and most of the feudal vestiges remaining in 121 villages have also been eliminated, bringing the county's land reform movement to a balanced state. Therefore, the county specially convened a county-wide Upsurge Hero Conference on the 24th of last month to celebrate the initial completion of land reform in the county and continue in-depth land investigation. The conference was attended by 357 upsurge heroes and representatives from the county's eleven districts, and 20 upsurge heroes from Xingtai City also attended. Through two days of group discussions and three days of speeches at the conference, the heroes not only recognized the true face of the landlords from the exploitative relationships but also realized the tenacity of the landlords from the struggles over the years, gained a deeper understanding of the landlords, and improved their thinking. Before the meeting, the masses in the mountainous areas thought that the plains were prosperous and that the poor people suffered less than in the mountainous areas. The masses in the mountainous and plain areas also thought that the people in Xingtai City suffered less than them. Thus, there was some estrangement in everyone's thinking. However, after the heroes poured out their sufferings at the conference, everyone realized that the crows in the world are generally black, the landlords are equally bad everywhere, and the poor masses are all one family, and the heroes of the county united closely. In addition, the heroes in the new districts had not engaged in long-term struggles with the landlords and did not know much about the landlords' stubbornness and cunning, thinking that after a major move, the landlords would not dare to do anything. After listening to the reports of the heroes in the old districts on their eight years of arduous struggle with the landlords and all the sabotage methods used by the landlords, their understanding and vigilance towards the landlords also increased. Furthermore, they discovered some feudal vestiges that had not been thoroughly struggled against. At the summary meeting, Comrade Guo Fengshan, Secretary of the County Party Committee, gave a brief account of the county's land reform movement over the past year, pointing out that through the upsurge movement over the past year, the masses of the county have recovered more than 147,000 mu of land, accounting for about 30 percent of the total cultivated land area, more than 67,000 houses, more than 2,000 head of livestock, more than 100,000 shi of grain, 227 taels of gold, more than 9,700 taels of silver, more than 122,000 silver dollars, and more than 50 million yuan of Jicha, as well as many other agricultural tools, clothing, and furniture. In addition, a large number of weapons were seized from the landlords' homes, with 87 villages seizing 37 long and short guns and more than 1,800 rounds of various bullets.

    土地分配不匀绝不歇手
　　邢台翻身英雄大会确定
    大生产中继续查田
    充分发动贫雇扫清封建残余
    【本报特讯】经过旧历年前后两个月的深入运动，邢台全县的五十一个落后村已全部突破，一百二十一个村里尚残存下来的封建尾巴，亦已大部消灭，使全县的土地改革运动走向平衡。因此，县里特于上月二十四日召开全县翻身英雄大会，庆祝全县土地改革的初步完成并继续深入查田。到会有全县十一个区的翻身英雄及翻身代表，共三百五十七名，邢台市的翻身英雄二十名亦出席参加。经过两天小组讨论和三天大会发言，使英雄们不仅从剥削关系上认识了地主的真面目；并且从历年的斗争中体会到地主的顽抗性，对地主有了更深刻的认识，思想上更提高了一步。未开会前，山地群众以为平原地好富足，穷人受的罪一定比山地轻；而山地和平原的群众，又都以为邢台市民的苦处，总要比他们少些；这样，大家思想上就有些隔阂。但英雄们在大会上诉苦以后，大家才知道原来平原和市里群众所受的痛苦，和山地一样。于是，大家都彻底认识到天下老鸦一般黑，到处地主都一样坏，穷苦的群众都是一家人，全县英雄亲密的团结起来。另外，新区的英雄们没有和地主进行过长时期的斗争，还不甚了解地主的顽抗和狡诈，以为大动后，地主们就不敢怎么样了。在听了老区英雄们报告了和地主八年来艰苦斗争的经验，以及地主所使用的一切破坏手段后，他们对地主的认识和警惕也提高了。进一步又发现了一些还没有斗彻底的封建尾巴。在总结会上，县委书记郭凤山同志把本县一年来的土地改革运动作了扼要的叙述，指出：经过一年来的翻身运动，全县群众共收回土地十四万七千余亩，约占全耕地面积总数百分之三十，房屋六万七千余间，牲口两千余头，粮食十万余石，金子二百二十七两，银子九千七百余两，银元十二万二千余元及冀钞五千余万元，其他农具、衣服、家具等甚多。另外，还从地主家里搜出大批武器，八十七个村计查获长短枪三十七支，各种子弹一千八百余发。
