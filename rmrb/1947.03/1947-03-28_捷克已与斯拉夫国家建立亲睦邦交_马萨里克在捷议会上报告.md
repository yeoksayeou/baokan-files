    Czechoslovakia Has Established Amicable Relations with Slavic Countries
    Masaryk Reports to the Czech Parliament
    [This is a TASS dispatch from Prague, dated March 23rd:] Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Masaryk recently reported to the National Constituent Assembly on Czechoslovakia's foreign policy, detailing the amicable relations between Czechoslovakia and other democratic Slavic countries. Masaryk stated: "Last year, we further strengthened the amicable relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. The eventful past year has once again proven that we and the Soviet Union share sincerity in resolving the most significant issues in post-war Europe. Like the Soviet Union, we are extremely concerned about the elimination of Nazism and Fascism, and we are also concerned about eliminating the dangers of German aggressive ideology from the heart of Europe. We hope that Slavic countries can safeguard their borders in accordance with the reasonable interests of their nations and their economic and security needs.” Masaryk highly praised the Soviet Union's foreign policy and particularly emphasized the importance of the Polish-Czech Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance signed in Warsaw on March 10th, which aims to consolidate European security and defend against new aggression from Germany or other countries colluding with Germany. Masaryk continued: Our amicable relations with Yugoslavia, based on the Yugoslav-Czech Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance signed in Belgrade on May 9, 1946, are developing effectively. Masaryk said he confidently expects to consolidate amicable relations with Bulgaria; after the signing of the peace treaty, Bulgaria will return to the family of freedom-loving nations.
    [This is a TASS dispatch from Prague, dated March 24th:] During the debate in the Czech National Constituent Assembly on Foreign Minister Masaryk's report, twelve members of parliament, representing various political parties, fully endorsed the government's foreign policy, supporting the establishment of close amicable relations and cooperation with the Soviet Union, other Slavic countries, and Western democratic countries.
