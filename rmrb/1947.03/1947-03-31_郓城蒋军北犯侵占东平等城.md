(Reported from the Jilu Yu Front Line on the 29th) The 32nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Yuncheng, and the 85th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Wenshang, invaded northward simultaneously. The 32nd Division occupied Dongping City on the 23rd. The 85th Division successively occupied Dong'a and Pingyin on the 24th and 26th. The two Chiang Kai-shek armies were effectively resisted by our militia and local troops along the way, suffering heavy losses. Currently, these three cities are under constant attack and siege by our guerrillas and militia. This move by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the eastern front is clearly an attempt to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek 11th, 64th, and 7th Divisions in their northward invasion of my Xi'an and other places from Ziyang (Yanzhou) along the Jinpu Railway.

    郓城蒋军北犯侵占东平等城
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】冀鲁豫区东平郓城蒋军三十二师与汶上蒋军八十五师同时北犯，三十二师于二十三日侵占东平城。八十五师于二十四、二十六两日先后侵占我东阿、平阴两城，两路蒋军沿途遭我民兵及地方部队有力阻击，损失甚重。现该三城正在我游击队及民兵不断袭击围困中。东线蒋军此举显系企图配合蒋军第十一师、六十四师、第七师由滋阳（兖州）沿津浦路北犯我西安等地。
