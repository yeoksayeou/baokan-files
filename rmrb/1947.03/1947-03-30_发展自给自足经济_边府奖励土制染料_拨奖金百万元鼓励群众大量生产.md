Developing a Self-Sufficient Economy
Border Region Government Rewards Locally Produced Dyes
Allocates 1 Million Yuan in Bonuses to Encourage Mass Production

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper] In order to develop a self-sufficient economy, the Border Region Government has made a decision to promote and reward locally produced dyes, calling on the people of the Border Region to vigorously promote their existing experience in making local dyes, and to strive to experiment and research, improve and enhance them. The content of the decision is as follows:

According to investigations, the total annual import of dyes for the entire region requires an average expenditure of more than 20 catties of rice per person per year. What an astonishing amount of leakage this is! In the past year, the price of dyes has risen three to five times more than the price of grain. The dyeing cost for one foot of cloth is more expensive than the cloth itself. What an unreasonable phenomenon this is! Our local products are exported in exchange for such a large amount of unequal-value dyes, causing a great loss to our people's economy and having an extremely unfavorable impact on farmers' production. It should be said that this is one of the roots of poverty for the vast number of people in our region. We should be determined to ban the import of dyes and various luxury goods, dig out the roots of poverty, promote local goods, and reward industry to plant the roots of wealth.

To this end, it is decided to widely reward the creation and invention of mass-based local dye methods. The government has determined a total bonus of one million yuan, and has instructed the Construction Department to set up a special committee to widely solicit various methods from the people for manufacturing dyes using plant roots, stems, leaves, bark, as well as chemical methods. It is hoped that all compatriots and technical experts in the region will strive hard to create, invent, improve, and enhance local dyes, and introduce various manufacturing methods to the government in detail. Once reviewed and found applicable, in addition to being given bonuses separately, they will also be commended or awarded medals. If it is necessary to set up factories for manufacturing, the government will invest to support them and provide various conveniences in sales.

[Another News] In order to specifically organize the manufacture of locally produced dyes, the Border Region Government has specifically instructed all administrative offices and counties: (1) Ideologically, it must be clear that achieving self-sufficiency in dyes is specifically serving the masses and specifically performing meritorious service for the people. At the same time, it must be clearly understood that our region has sufficient natural conditions, with extremely rich reserves of various dyeing raw materials such as plants and minerals. As long as mass invention and creation are added, it is entirely possible to solve the problem. We must have the determination and confidence to organize this work. (2) It is necessary to become a mass movement, combining the government cadres' movement to perform meritorious service, mobilizing everyone to contribute their own experience and wisdom, and promptly commending those who have achieved even a little success. (3) Help the masses to improve and enhance their conservative old experiences and old methods, promote new inventions and creations, and send the raw materials and manufacturing methods to the local county government for review. Those who are reviewed and determined to be applicable shall be rewarded and their experience shall be widely introduced, and the manufacturing shall be specifically organized and promoted. Governments at all levels below the administrative office shall propose a certain amount of bonus money and issue medals and certificates of merit within the principles of the budget. The reward coverage should be wide in order to mobilize the broad masses. The Border Region Government will focus on rewarding those who have made outstanding achievements in improving and enhancing old methods and in new inventions and creations. (4) Once reviewed and tested to be applicable, they should be immediately encouraged to engage in sideline production or set up factories for manufacturing based on specific conditions. Governments and cooperatives at all levels should specifically organize, effectively support, and organize sales. (5) Governments at all levels should promptly report to the Border Region Government the discovered methods of local dye production and new inventions and creations, regardless of size. (Guang Ju)

    发展自给自足经济
    边府奖励土制染料
    拨奖金百万元鼓励群众大量生产
    【本报特讯】为发展自给自足经济，边府特作出提倡奖励土制染料决定，号召边区人民大力发扬旧有土制染料的经验，并努力试验研究，加以改良与提高，决定的内容如左：
    根据调查，全区全年之入口染料，平均每人每年需二十多斤米的支出。这是何等惊人的一笔漏记，一年以来，染料涨价超过粮食涨价的三倍到五倍，一尺布的染色钱比一尺布价还贵，这又是何等的不合理现象？我们土产出口换来的是如此大量的不等价交换的染料，造成我们人民经济的大损失，给予农民生产以极不利的影响，应该说这是本区广大人民的穷根之一，我们应该下定决心禁止染料及各种奢侈品入口，挖掉穷根，提倡土货，奖励工业以栽富根。
    为此决定广泛奖励群众性的土制染料办法的创造发明，本府确定奖金总额一百万元，并责成建设厅设专门委员会，广泛征求民间利用植物根茎叶皮以及用化学办法制造染料的各种办法。望全区同胞及技术专家，奋发努力，创造发明或改良提高土染料，并将各种制法，详细介绍来府，一经审查适用，除分别给予奖金外，并分别表扬或赠予奖章。如需设厂制造者，本府当投资支持，并给予推销上的种种便利。
    【又讯】边府为具体组织土制染料的制造，特指示各行署及各专县：（一）思想上明确能做到染料自给即是具体的为群众服务，是具体的为民立功，同时须明确了解本区有足够的自然条件，各种染色原料植物矿物等蕴藏极富，只要加上群众性的发明创造是完全可以解决的，要有决心有信心的去组织这一工作。（二）要成为群众性的运动，结合着政府干部立功运动，发动每个人贡献出自己的经验与智慧，有一点成就者都抓紧表扬。（三）帮助群众将保守着的旧经验与旧办法改良提高，提倡新的发明创造，将原料及制法送当地县政府审查，经审定确为适用者，予以奖励，并广泛介绍其经验，与具体组织推广制造。行署以下各级政府，在不影响预算原则下提出一定数额奖金并制发奖章奖状，奖励面要宽，以期动员广大群众。边府则着重奖励旧办法的改良提高与新的发明创造之有优越成绩者。（四）一经审查试验适用者，应即根据具体条件，鼓励群众当作副业生产，或设厂制造，各级政府各级合作社要具体组织，确实支持，并组织推销。（五）各级政府要将所发现之土制染料办法及新的发明创造，无论大小随时速报边府。    （广居）
