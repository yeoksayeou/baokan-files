　　【This newspaper, Taihang, 13th dispatch】In order to strengthen the education of the correspondents, cooks, and grooms of the Taihang Third Administrative Office, the office established a night school for its support staff last month, hiring office cadres as teachers to hold classes. The curriculum includes ideological education, general knowledge of current events and politics, literacy, Mandarin Chinese, and arithmetic, among other cultural subjects. Since its establishment, the school has been quite effective. Not only has the political awareness and cultural level of the support staff gradually improved, but it has also promoted the office's movement for thrift and production. For example, orderlies and cooks actively collect hemp fibers and coal dross, and correspondents and grooms are very active in transportation. Work is intense and life is active, creating a refreshing atmosphere. The office also established this school last spring, gaining experience that learning must be combined with work. When starting a school, it is necessary not only to work on the thinking of the support staff and inspire their initiative to learn, but also for office leaders to be responsible for calling and helping, giving it importance, and making cadres clearly understand that the support staff is the basic mass of the office, and enthusiastically serve them. After the start of the school, attention should be paid to commendation at any time, cultivating activists, grouping them according to their level and allowing them to lead themselves. The "little teacher" system can also be used to help those who are absent from class, and those who are on business trips or out of town can be assigned self-study according to their level.

　　【Taihang, 13th dispatch】Primary school students in the Jiang-occupied area of northern Henan, unable to bear the suffering of being conscripted by the Chiang and puppet regime, have fled to the Liberated Areas one after another. Eighty-seven male and female primary school students who fled from Jiaozuo and Bo'ai to our Lingchuan County have recently been studying in the joint high school specially established for them by the Fourth Administrative Office. The Fourth Administrative Office also allocated 100 shi of rice as a school production fund, and the Eighth Middle School also lent 15 spinning wheels to help them produce. They are now all very settled in their studies.
