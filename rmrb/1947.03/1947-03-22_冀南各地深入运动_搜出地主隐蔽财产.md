    Hebei South Areas Deepen Movement
    Search Out Landlords' Hidden Wealth
    [Our Hebei South Dispatch from the 20th] Hebei South areas continue to search out landlords' hidden wealth. In Beizhang Village, Fifth District, Chengxian County, the landlord Zhang Weiqing had no good things left when the masses inspected his property. The masses knew that his daughter, a "Catholic Saint" (religious), was his "chief of staff." At the general meeting, they questioned her, but she was very tough and pretended: If I hide my father's things, God will immediately crack the ground into a black hole and push me into hell. At the time, many people were deceived and bewildered by her. However, after the turning-over association exposed her, they found the baggage she had hidden. Meng Erben of Liuhu Village, First District, Zhendang, was a feudal landlord. Last year, during the mass movement, 80 mu of his land were touched, but his house and floating wealth were not. His family still lived the life of a landlord. Last November, when they inspected his property, he distributed all his clothes and farm implements to 57 farmers in the village. Most of these farmers had been his tenants or hired laborers. When he dispersed the property, he said: "As long as I get through this struggle, we will divide the things 30/70, and I will never let you work for nothing." So, when they struggled against his floating wealth, there were only a few broken cabinets and boxes in his home. Through repeated deliberation and discussion in the Farmers' Association, the 57 farmers recognized Meng Erben's conspiracy and reported the hidden things one after another.
    [Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch from the 20th] When Feicheng Third District was carrying out "filling in the gaps and making up the differences," it exposed the landlords' conspiracy to confuse the masses. There are more than 170 households in Zhao Village, Third District, which had undergone liquidation and grievances and land reform, but it was not thorough. Some landlords pretended to do small business, and the cadres were temporarily blinded, thinking that "filling in the gaps and making up the differences" could not be done. Later, they analyzed and studied each household's living conditions and different geology door to door. It was found that there were still four landlords who retained a lot of land. In the whole village, except for 86 middle peasants, the remaining 80 households were poor peasants and landless households. Only then did they realize that they had been confused by the landlords, so they broke the idea that there was no target. In this way, the masses quickly started working. As a result, all the landlords' floating wealth was confiscated, and 91 mu of land, 11 courtyards, 4 donkeys, and 3 cotton gins were taken back.

    冀南各地深入运动
    搜出地主隐蔽财产
    【本报冀南二十日电】冀南各地继续搜查地主隐蔽财产。成县五区北张庄地主张渭清，当群众检查他的财产时，好东西都没有了。群众知道他闺女“天主圣女”（信教）是他的“参谋长”，在大会上追问她，她态度非常硬，并装腔作势说：我如果藏了我父亲的东西，天主立刻把地裂成黑洞，把我推到地狱里去，当时许多群众被她欺骗迷惑。但在翻身会检举下，发现她隐藏的包袱。振堂一区六户村孟二本是个封建地主，去年群运时动了他八十亩地，宅子浮财没动，他家仍过着地主的生活；去年十一月检查时，他把家中所有的衣物农具全数分藏本村五十七户农民家里；而这些农民多都当过他的佃户或雇工，他疏散时说：“只要我熬过这次斗争，咱们三七分东西，绝不叫你们白费心。”所以到斗争他的浮财时，家中只有几件破烂的柜箱。在农会反复酝酿讨论中，五十七户农民认识了孟二本的阴谋，纷纷报出所藏东西。
    【本报冀鲁豫廿日电】肥城三区进行“填平补齐”时，揭破地主迷惑群众的阴谋。三区赵家村有一百七十多户，曾进行过清算诉苦与土地改革，但并未彻底，有的地主假装做小买卖，干部一时被蒙蔽，认为“填平补齐”无法搞。后来根据各家的生活好坏，地质的不同等来挨门分析研究。发现还有四家地主保有不少土地，全村除八十六家中农外，其余八十多家都是贫农和无地户，才了解到受了地主迷惑，便打破没对象的想法，这样群众很快的就干起来了。结果将地主的浮财全部没收，并要回土地九十一亩，院子十一处，驴四头，弹花弓三个。
