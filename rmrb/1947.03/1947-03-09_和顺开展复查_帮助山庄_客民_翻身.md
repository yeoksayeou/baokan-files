　　He Shun Launches Review
    Helping "Guest People" in Mountain Villages Overturn Their Situation
    [Report from this newspaper in He Shun] The He Shun County Party Committee summarized the work of universal training of farmers at the joint meeting of secretaries last month and called for the launch of a review movement. The First District of the county regarded the sudden attack on mountain village nests as one of the central tasks before spring plowing. District leaders, from the universal training of farmers, discovered that in Xiaoshan Villages around Feng and Gaojia Zhuang, the immigrants still have not overturned their situation, and the village government is still controlled by feudal forces. In the whole village of more than 220 households, many immigrants lived a miserable life like servants. Many poor tenant farmers who rented mountain land had no surplus grain to fill their stomachs at the end of the year and no cotton clothes to cover themselves in the cold winter. They urgently demanded to overturn their situation. In the short period when district cadres cooperated with activists to go deep into the mountain villages, it was discovered that 23 immigrants had been beaten to death by "mountain owners", 120 had been forced to beg for food, and 98 had starved to death. They poured out their years of suffering, accused the mountain tyrants of their feudal rule crimes, and recovered a large amount of land they had reclaimed. The mountain village democratic government was transformed. However, because there were many stones and little land in the mountain villages, the land was not enough for the immigrants to be distributed. They organized 70 poor households to move to rich villages, and distributed the remaining mountain land and houses to the mountain village farmers to completely overturn their situation. Now the farmers who have moved to large villages such as Baizhen have received assistance from the local farmers' association and have been allocated sufficient land and grain. Now they are no longer discriminated against as "outsiders" and are united with the local farmers who have overturned their situation, living a new and happy life.

　　和顺开展复查
    帮助山庄“客民”翻身
    【本报和顺讯】和顺县委于上月分书联席会上总结普训农民工作，号召开展复查运动。该县一区把突击山庄窝村，当作春耕前中心任务之一。区领导上从普训农民中、发现冯、郜家庄一带小山庄，外来户仍然没有翻身，村政权至今仍为封建势力所把持。全村二百二十余户不少外来移民，过着婢奴一样悲惨生活。许多租种山地贫佃农，年关却无余粮充饥，严冬没有棉衣遮盖，他们迫切要求翻身，在区干部配合积极分子深入山庄活跃短时期中，发现外来移民被“山主”打死者廿三人，被逼讨饭者一百二十人，饿死九十八人。他们尽情的倾吐多年的痛苦，控诉山霸王封建统治罪恶，收回了自己开垦的大批土地，改造了山庄民主政权。但由于山庄石多地少，土地不够移民分配，他们组织了七十户贫农迁移富村，把遗下山地房屋，分配山庄农民彻底翻身。现移到白珍等大村农民，得到当地农会帮助，分得足够的土地和粮食，现在他们已不再被当作“外来户”来歧视，和本地翻身农民团结一致，过着新的愉快生活。（志远、世昌、拴林、贵）
