    Experiencing the Suffering of the Masses to Enhance Fighting Spirit
    Wen County Cadres Persist in Struggle
    Recover and Restore Rural Base Areas Behind Enemy Lines
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Wen County cadres have enhanced their fighting spirit by experiencing the suffering of the people and are rising up to carry out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, recovering and maintaining rural base areas. After the Chiang troops invaded the county, cadres wanted to rely on the main force and were afraid to advance alone into enemy-controlled areas. The leadership did not adopt direct criticism of this negative retreat mentality but called on everyone to universally recall the suffering of the masses. One cadre, when talking about the disasters suffered by the masses under the trampling of the Chiang troops after our withdrawal from Wen County, and the recent repeated requests from the masses for us to persist in Wen County, felt that he would have no face to face the Wen County compatriots if he did not persist, and almost cried. After deep reflection, everyone unanimously resolved to go back and swear to the masses to persist in Wen County. Thus, all the cadres rose up and advanced into the enemy's rear, fearlessly launching fierce struggles against special agents and "retaliation." As of the end of February, of the 164 administrative villages in the county that had been invaded and occupied, 36 were already under our control, and many other villages were preparing to contact us. The landlords of Village × held meetings for three days, trying to figure out how to make contact, but they could not come up with any leads. Finally, they decided to ask a member of our peasant association to introduce them to us. When the member refused, they all knelt down and begged. A female family member of a soldier who resisted Japan from Village × came out of the village to find one of our cadres. After she returned to the village, everyone in the village spread the word that she had brought the Eighth Route Army back with her. The bad guys were all scared away. Later, when they saw that there was no Eighth Route Army, they returned to the female family member and said, "We are all from the same village. We have kept the fruits of your previous struggle for you. Whenever you want them, we will bring them back to you." Many armed work team members have now written letters to their villages, asking them to reverse the struggle to seize back the fruits. The anti-retaliation movement is developing vigorously.

    体验群众痛苦提高斗志
    温县干部坚持斗争
    复恢敌后农村阵地
    【本报特讯】温县干部从体验人民痛苦中提高斗志奋起开展敌后游击战争，恢复与坚持农村阵地。蒋军侵入该县之后，干部都想依靠主力，不敢单独挺进敌人统治区。领导上对这种消极的退却情绪没有采取正面批评，而号召大家普遍回忆群众痛苦。一个干部在谈到我们退出温县后群众受蒋军蹂躏的灾难及最近群众一再向我们要求坚持温县时，感到再不坚持就无脸见温县同胞，几乎哭起来。大家经过深刻反省，也都一致下决心回去向群众宣誓坚持温县。于是全体干部奋起挺进敌后，不避艰险的对敌展开猛烈的反特务、反“倒算”斗争。截至二月底止，该县一百六十四个被侵陷行政村，已有卅六个为我掌握，另有不少村庄正准备找我接头。×村地主整开了三天会，想不出接头线索，最后决定要求我们一个农会会员介绍给我们接头，该会员表示拒绝时，他们便一齐跪倒要求。×村一个女抗属出村来找了一下我们的干部，回村后，村上人都传说她带着八路军回来了，坏蛋都被吓跑，后来看见没有八路军时，又回村对这女抗属讲：“咱是一村人，你以前倒出来的果实，我们是给你保存着，你什么时候要，我们什么时候给你往回拿，”不少武工队员现已给自己村上去信，让倒回被夺之斗争果实。反倒算运动正猛烈开展中。
