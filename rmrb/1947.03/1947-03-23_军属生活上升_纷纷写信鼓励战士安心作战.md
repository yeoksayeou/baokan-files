    From the Ji-Lu-Yu Front, March 21st (Report from our newspaper) - After receiving merit citations, military dependents in the rear areas have been writing letters to the soldiers at the front, reporting on the improvement of their families' situations during the land reform movement, as well as the people's love for their sons and brothers and their enthusiasm for supporting the front lines. The political department of a certain regiment received as many as 93 letters from soldiers' families in one day. Among them was a description from the masses of Houhuayuan Village in Zaoqiang County, celebrating the meritorious service of soldier Wang Yujin, saying: "After the news of victory came, we were very impressed by your heroic struggle. During the Lunar New Year, the villagers prepared a glorious plaque. Children, women's literacy classes, and male and female militia members went to your home with gongs and drums, shouting slogans, and invited you to a feast." Jin Qingxue's family in Lin County wrote to their son Jin Erzi, who was in a certain artillery unit: "Last year, we bought one mu of irrigated land, which was also cultivated by the village on our behalf. There is plenty of food at home, and everything is going well." Jin Tianfu also received a letter from home, saying that in the movement to level and make up land, his family had increased by five mu of land through adjustment and purchasing, a house, and a mule. They already have enough to eat and wear, and don't have to worry about life anymore. There were also two letters written by the soldiers' wives. One was from Liu Jincheng's wife, reporting: "Everything is harmonious and beautiful at home, and another twelve people have joined the army in the village." A woman from Shangcun Village in the 11th District of Lin County wrote to her husband, Guo Tianxi, saying: "This time we were allocated 20,000 yuan in fruits of labor, bought three rooms, four fen of irrigated land, and also allocated one mu of dry land. Things are going very smoothly at home, and there are no difficulties. I hope you will work hard outside, achieve victory early, and completely eliminate the reactionaries. Please tell me about the victories at the front."
