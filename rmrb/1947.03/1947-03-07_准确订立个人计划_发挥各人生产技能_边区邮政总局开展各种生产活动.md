[Report from this newspaper] The Border Region Postal Administration has launched various production activities. Fifteen comrades from the administration who remained at home and persisted in their work formulated individual production and frugality plans based on their physical strength, workload, and available time. They also detailed their monthly tasks for submission to the public, publicized to the club to facilitate mutual supervision among groups. Red and blue lists are filled out monthly, with those who fail to complete their tasks appearing on the blue list. Currently, in one cadre group of five people, four have learned to spin cotton. The entire administration has borrowed seven spinning wheels. Many cadres from the Postal Administration and Postal School have halted their cigarette-rolling plans and joined the cotton-spinning campaign. The flour-milling group earned five thousand yuan in a week and immediately reinvested it in further production. They reward those with a correct attitude towards production and those who work actively and diligently. In terms of production methods, in addition to collective labor, farming, grass cutting, and flour milling, they strive to utilize each person's production skills to the fullest. One comrade is skilled at making plows. He collaborated with a carpenter in the village to make ten plows before the spring plowing season, which earned ten thousand yuan. Making another ten plows in the autumn plowing season will more than double their task. After overcoming the mentality of relying on the public, the family members of the administration's cadres have engaged in self-sufficiency activities, spinning six to eight ounces of thread per day, and they plan to cooperate with the cadres to weave cloth, exceeding their self-sufficiency production plans.
