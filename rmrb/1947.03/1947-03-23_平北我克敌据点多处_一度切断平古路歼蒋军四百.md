    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st— The Ji-Re-Cha People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces, launched an attack on the Pingchuan area of Pingbei (north of Beiping) on the evening of the 2nd of this month. In two days of combat, they recovered strongholds such as Gaoliying, Beimafang, Niulanshan, Dongsanqi, Luding, and Daxinfeng, killing and wounding 165 enemy soldiers, capturing over 90 puppet troops, and seizing two light machine guns, two grenade launchers, 106 rifles, five pistols, two American automatic rifles, over 6,000 rounds of ammunition, over 90 hand grenades, 100,000 catties of grain, and other military supplies. Our army then withdrew from Gaoliying and Niulanshan.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st— The Eighth Route Army in Pingbei and Chanan counterattacked the Chiang and Fu troops who were nibbling away at our territory, eliminating nearly 400 enemy soldiers. On the 2nd of this month, the Pingbei area recovered the Niulanshan station, 30 li north of Shunyi on the Pinggu Road, and the important town of Mafang on the Beiping-Huairou highway, eliminating over 250 enemy soldiers. On the 11th, the Eighth Route Army in Chanan counterattacked the Fu troops' New 31st Division, 92nd Regiment, which had invaded Daxieyang in Zhuolu, eliminating over 130 enemy soldiers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st— The objective situation in the Ji-Zhong and Ji-Jin areas in February was characterized by two main aspects: first, the bulk of Chiang’s troops were concentrated on the Ping-Bao line in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, leaving other areas sparsely defended, and the people's guerrilla warfare became increasingly active; second, the Chiang and puppet troops in the border areas actively plundered grain and property from the liberated areas, leading to an unprecedentedly tense anti-nibbling and anti-grain-grabbing struggle in various places. According to incomplete statistics, in February, the Eighth Route Army and local armed forces in these two areas fought over a hundred battles, liberating 14 important villages and towns occupied by Chiang and puppet forces, including Jie×zhen (belonging to Yangshuo on the Zhengtai Railway), Jinjiafan (belonging to Xin County on the Tongpu Railway), Changzhen (between Zhengding and Xinle on the Pinghan Railway), and Xinan Town, Wangbo, and Xindian near northwest Tianjin, killing, wounding, and capturing over 1,500 Chiang and puppet soldiers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Han Front, 19th— The Chiang troops occupying Yixian and Mancheng in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway have been plunged into the flames of guerrilla warfare. Dozens of guerrilla teams, demolition squads, and work teams composed of local people have fought the enemy more than ten times in the past two weeks, killing and wounding over 30 Chiang’s Mancheng county government section chiefs and below. On the nights of the 4th and 5th of this month, militiamen in the Mancheng area, braving the night, twice attacked Mancheng and the Chiang army stronghold of Libao Village nearby, destroying all 30 bunkers. Militiamen in Yixian captured four major traitors from Lianghang, five li from the city, including Lu Yingzhou and Tong Zhongqiu, who had been heavily employed by the Chiang family, forcing the Chiang and puppet forces in the two cities and their nearby strongholds to only be able to defend themselves within newly built fortifications, and any attempt to venture out was met with attacks. The vast countryside along the Yi-Man line remains under the control of the People's Liberation Army.
