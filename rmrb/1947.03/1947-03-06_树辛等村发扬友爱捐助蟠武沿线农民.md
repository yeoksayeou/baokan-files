　　[Our Newspaper News] Li Yu, Changle, and nineteen other villages along the Panwu line in Wuxiang suffered severe damage from the enemy's destruction in 1943, resulting in significant material losses. During this round of rent reduction, although farmers obtained land, they still faced many difficulties. The leadership initiated a mutual aid movement, calling on wealthier villages to extend class friendship and provide assistance. This has yielded significant results. More than ten villages in the Third District, including Shuxin, Donggou, and Wanggou, contributed 300,000 yuan. Thirteen villages in the Second District, including Dongbao, Hanbi, and Shimen, contributed 49 shi of grain, 20 mu of land, and 500,000 yuan to help the masses in the villages along the Panwu line achieve a complete turnaround. Wealthy villages in this district are also helping poor villages. For example, Tuansong is helping Dongfangshan with 40 shi of grain and 40 mu of land; Zhujiashan is also helping Dongfangshan with 20 shi of grain and 40 mu of land; and Sibao is helping Nan Shanghe with 50 mu of land.
