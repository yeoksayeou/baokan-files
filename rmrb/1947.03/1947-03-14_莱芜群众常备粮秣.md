Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 12th. During the Northern Expedition War, the masses of Laiwu created a method of regularly stocking provisions, which was convenient for both the army and the people. This method involves each household regularly stocking 20 catties of millet, 5 catties of pancakes, 100 catties of firewood, 2 catties of dried vegetables, and two households preparing a pair of shoes. When the troops arrive, these supplies are concentrated for use. Afterwards, the village collectively settles the accounts, and after the supplies are used up, they are replenished according to the original amount. This avoids the problem of being unprepared in case of emergencies.

　　莱芜群众常备粮秣
    【新华社山东十二日电】北伐大战中莱芜群众创造粮秣常备法，军民称便。该法为每家常备小米二十斤，煎饼五斤，木柴一百斤，干菜二斤，两家准备一双鞋子，部队来时即集中使用，事后由村中统一算帐，用完后又按数准备起来，可免临时筹措不及。
