[This dispatch from our Taihang office is dated March 15th.] Land reform has been largely completed in more than ten counties, including Changzhi, Lucheng, Huguan, Licheng, Heshun, Yushe, Wuxiang, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, Shexian, and Wu'an. A universal re-examination is now underway. The development of this movement in various regions has started with mass training of peasants to conduct systematic ideological education, raising the masses' ideological awareness. Cadres and the masses consciously united before universally launching repeated inspections. The main goals are to inspect whether the feudal landlords have been thoroughly eliminated and whether the land has been distributed fairly and reasonably. In Heshun, the re-examination unfolded throughout the county after mass training of peasants in early February. In Fenggao Village, first district, a small mountain village, feudal forces still controlled village affairs, and more than two hundred outside households had not yet been liberated. After enlightenment through mass training, these people voluntarily rose up to settle accounts with the landlords, and more than seventy households moved to other villages with the help of district cadres. Now all the poor peasants in the village have been liberated, and the political power is also in the hands of the peasants. After enlightenment, the peasants in Xucun decided to separate from the landlords, voluntarily taking out thirty-five *shi* of grain and more than ten bundles of belongings that they had hidden for the landlords. After mass training in Zhanmalu Village, sixth district, landlords were thoroughly liquidated, and the gains recovered exceeded any previous time. After mass training in Yushe, many honest peasants who dared not speak or manage village affairs became activists. In villages such as Hecun and Beicun, honest peasants, after being trained in the district and returning to their villages, immediately sought out village cadres that night to demand thorough liberation. Six old men in Shencun urged village cadres to reprocess the unfairly distributed gains. After ideological movement in Changzhi Village, the ideas of "conscience" and "fate" were discarded, and landlords such as Cai Liuhaizi were thoroughly liquidated, recovering more than four hundred silver dollars and grain quilts, etc. After a major ideological transformation, Catholic people in Zhao Jia Ling, Xiangyuan, conducted a general liquidation against the feudal rulers. After the ideological awareness of cadres and masses in Qiushutan, Zuoquan, was raised, the knots were untied, and land was redistributed, and mountain village peasants were also liberated. In Futou Village, Huguan, honest peasants consciously investigated and found more than seventy *mu* of land, houses, grain, and livestock belonging to landlords. In Lucheng, an ideological transformation was conducted throughout the county at the end of February. In Shexian, more than ten thousand new (honest peasants) and old activists were trained in districts in early March, and the two counties are now carrying out universal re-examination. Licheng is now preparing to thoroughly re-examine by calling a conference of more than ten thousand activists and village cadres to inspire awareness and launch a unity movement. This movement proves that although the previous large-scale movement and inspection movement initially raised the masses' awareness and greatly relieved the masses' ideological obstacles such as "conscience," "fate," and "change of dynasty"; however, because the education was only partial, one-sided, and not systematic, the masses' thoughts have not yet been transformed. This led to "backward" actions such as pitying landlords, unwillingness to thoroughly liquidate, fear of "change of dynasty" and not daring to demand gains, and preserving things for landlords. Therefore, to carry out re-examination, it is necessary to make a major ideological transformation, systematically raise the peasants' awareness, and completely separate them from the landlords in thought and action to thoroughly eliminate the landlords. Regarding the methods of major ideological transformation, some places (Heshun, Yushe, Shexian, Licheng, etc.) first directly train a group of key personnel by the district (such as Heshun training twenty thousand, Shexian ten thousand), and then use these people to universally train peasants; some places (such as Changzhi, Lucheng, Xiangyuan, etc.) use the village as a unit to mobilize peasants to generally express their grievances in winter school, inspiring class consciousness.

　　普训农民提高觉悟彻底扫清封建残余
    太行十余县普遍进行复查
    系统思想教育作法
    由区大量集训冬学发动诉苦
    【本报太行十五日电】长治、潞城、壶关、黎城、和顺、榆社、武乡、左权、襄垣、涉县、武安等十余县，土地改革已大体完成，现正普遍进行复查。这一运动的开展，各地都是首先经过普训农民，进行系统的思想教育，使群众思想觉悟提高，干部与群众自觉团结起来后，随即普遍展开反复检查。主要目标是：检查封建地主是否彻底消灭，土地是否平均合理的分配。和顺于二月初普训农民后，复查在全县展开。一区冯郜家庄一带山庄小村，封建势力仍然把持村政，二百余户外来户还未翻身。这些人经过普训觉悟，自动起来和地主算账，并有七十多户在区干部帮助下，移至外村，现全村贫农均已翻身，政权也归农民掌握。许村农民觉悟后，决与地主分家，自动拿出替地主隐藏的三十五石粮，十余个包袱。六区沾马路村普训后，彻底清算地主，收回果实超过以往任何一次。榆社农民经过普训，许多不敢说话、不管村事的老实农民都成了积极分子，河村、北村等村，老实农民在区受训回村，当夜就找村干部要求彻底翻身。申村六个老汉，催促村干部重新处理分配不公的果实。长治村经过思想运动，解除“良心”“命运”思想，彻底清算地主蔡六孩等，又收回银洋四百余元及粮食被子等。襄垣赵家岭天主教民，经过思想大翻身，遂向封建统治者进行了总清算。左权秋树滩干部群众觉悟提高，解开圪瘩后，重新分配土地，山庄农民亦获翻身。壶关福头村，老实农民自觉后，清查出地主土地七十余亩及房屋、粮食、牲口等。潞城二月底全县进行思想大翻身。涉县于三月初分区集训新（老实农民）旧积极分子万余人，现该两县正普行复查。黎城现正以号召开万余人的积极分子与村干部大会，启发觉悟，开展团结运动，准备彻底复查。这一运动证明：经过前次的大运动与检查运动，虽初步提高了群众觉悟，大大的解除了群众的“良心”“命运”“变天”等思想障碍；但是由于只是部分的、片面的、而未系统的进行教育，群众思想上仍没翻身；所以就产生了可怜地主、不愿彻底清算、害怕“变天”不敢要果实、给地主保存东西等“落后”行动。因之开展复查，必须使思想大翻身，系统的提高农民觉悟，使其在思想上行动上完全与地主彻底分家，才能达到彻底消灭地主。关于思想大翻身的做法，有的地方（和顺、榆社、涉县、黎城等县）是先由区直接训练一批骨干（如和顺训练二万，涉县一万），然后再依这些人普训农民；有的地方（如长治、潞城、襄垣等县）是以村为单位，在冬学里发动农民总诉苦，启发阶级自觉。
