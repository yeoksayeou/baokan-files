　　Yang and Rong Chairmen Cable Rooks and Todd
    Requesting Cessation of Chiang Kai-shek's Aircraft Atrocities and Adherence to Agreements to Stop Water Release
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Yang Xiufeng and Rong Wusheng, Vice Chairmen of the Border Region Government, recently sent a cable to Mr. Rooks of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Office, etc., regarding the request to cease the Kuomintang's atrocities along the lower reaches of the Yellow River and to stop the confluence and water release. The original cable is as follows:
    To Mr. Rooks of the UNRRA Office in Shanghai, and forwarded to Mr. Todd:
    The coordinated progress of the Qiangkou dike restoration project for the return of the Yellow River to its old course, to reduce downstream disasters, is a fundamental principle of all past agreements, and is of profound and immense importance to the lives and property of the seven million residents along the river in our region. All impartial people should give it the utmost concern and seek a win-win solution. The efforts made by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the people of our region in this direction over the years have been recognized by you, and should be sympathized with by all righteous friends in the world. What about the opposition of the Kuomintang government? Agreements are repeatedly made but then torn up. Actively blocking the breach closure, deliberately obstructing dike restoration, delaying the payment of project costs and resettlement relief funds, even condoning special agents to arrest and kill dike restoration personnel and sabotage dike restoration work. Recently, they have intensified their actions, violating the agreement to release water, and repeatedly sending aircraft to bomb and strafe the employees, materials, and civilian boats engaged in emergency repairs. Moreover, wherever the Chiang Kai-shek army goes, they even extensively excavate and destroy the new dikes built with the blood and sweat of millions of people. All of this has been personally witnessed by your subordinate, Mr. Hansen. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to achieve his conspiracy to eliminate the liberated areas, does not hesitate to resort to such vicious tactics, placing millions of people along the river in a deadly situation. I wonder what your thoughts are upon hearing this?
    Now the area along the river has become a world of terror, and people are scrambling to avoid death, let alone cooperating with dike restoration! However, I recently read a broadcast from the Central News Agency on March 6, stating that "The Hualienkou confluence project will begin on March 6 and will be fully completed by the 20th. The new diversion channel has been excavated, and water will be released on the 8th," I wonder if this is true? I would like to draw your attention to the stipulation in the Shanghai agreement of mid-February that "The date of the confluence will be determined by consultation among the Water Conservancy Commission, the UNRRA, and the four parties in the liberated areas, depending on the actual needs of the project in mid-March." Now that the Kuomintang is harassing and bombing the downstream areas, making dike restoration work impossible, we have not heard of any effective measures taken by you to stop this, but instead, you are unilaterally actively assisting in blocking the breach, making the confluence, digging the diversion channel, and releasing water. Is this a violation of the agreement? Where is the spirit of the agreement? The UNRRA's assistance to the Chinese people in river management is truly a righteous act, but such measures not only go against your original intentions, but also make you share the responsibility with the Kuomintang reactionaries for flooding the people of the liberated areas! The people of our region fear the deepening of the great disaster and are extremely indignant. We hereby submit the following matters for your consideration:
    1. The UNRRA should immediately take action to stop the Kuomintang's atrocities along the lower reaches of the river, in order to facilitate dike restoration work.
    2. In accordance with the spirit of the Shanghai agreement in mid-February, immediately stop the confluence and water release, and start the confluence after consultation among the four parties, depending on the progress of the downstream dike restoration project.
    3. Immediately allocate the full amount of the second phase of dike restoration project funds and necessary equipment so that construction can begin immediately when the agreement allows.
    4. Compensation should be provided for the losses of dike restoration personnel and materials caused by the Kuomintang's bombing and strafing.
    We earnestly request you to uphold justice and save the critical situation. This is the fortune of the millions of people along the river, and also the fortune of the friendship between the Chinese and American people.
      Yang Xiufeng, Rong Wusheng, Border Region Government of Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan
                  March 10th

　　杨、戎主席电鲁克期及塔德
    要求制止蒋机暴行遵照协议停止放水
    【本报特讯】边区政府杨找正副主席顷为要求制止蒋方在黄河下游沿岸之暴行及停止合龙放水，致电联总中国办事处鲁克斯先生等，原电如下：
    上海联总办事处鲁克斯先生并转塔德先生鉴：
    黄河归故之墙口复堤工程配合进行，以减少下游灾害，为年来历次协议之基本原则，关系我区沿河七百万居民之生命财产者至深且巨。凡属公正人士当必予以极度关怀而谋求两全之道。中共中央及本区政府人民年来本此方针所为之努力，当为先生等所共是，并应为举世正义友人所同情。反对国民党政府如何呢？协议屡订但随即被撕毁。积极堵口，故阻复堤，拖付工程费及移民救济费，纵使特务捕杀复堤人员，破坏复堤工作。近更变本加厉，违约放水之后，复不断以飞机轮番狂炸扫射抢险之员工资材与民船、而蒋军所至甚且大肆挖毁千万人血汗培成之新堤。凡此种种均为贵属韩森先生所亲历目睹。蒋介石为遂其消灭解放区之阴谋，不惜下此毒手，置沿河数百万人民于死地，未识先生等闻之感想如何？
    现在沿河已成恐怖世界，人民避死不遑，更无论与工复堤矣！乃顷阅中央社三月六日广播谓“花园口合龙工程三月六日开始，二十日前可全部完成。新引河已挖成，八日放水”云云，不知是否属实？特提起阁下注意最近二月中旬之上海协议中“合龙日期至三月中旬视工程实际需要再由水委会联总行及解放区四方面会商确定”之规定。今国民党在下游骚扰轰炸使复堤工作不能进行，未闻先生等有效制止，反而单方面的积极协助堵口合龙挖引河放水，是否违犯协议？协议之精神安在？联总协助中国人民治河实属义举，但如此措置，不惟有背先生等初衷，且将言辞与国民党反动派共负水淹解放区人民之责矣！本区人民惧大祸之日深，万分愤激，谨提下列数事请鉴纳：
    一、联总立即采取行动制止国民党在下游沿河之暴行，以利复堤工作。
    二、按照二月中旬上海协议之精神，立即停止合龙放水，视下游复堤工程进度，经四方面协议再开始合龙。
    三、立即拨足应发之第二期复堤工程费及应用器材以便于协议许可时立即兴工。
    四、因国民党飞机轰炸扫射所遭受之复堤人员物资损失，应予补偿。
    敬恳主持正义，力挽危局，沿河数百万人民之幸，亦中美人民友谊之幸。
      晋冀鲁豫边区政府  杨秀峰  戎伍胜
                  三月十日
