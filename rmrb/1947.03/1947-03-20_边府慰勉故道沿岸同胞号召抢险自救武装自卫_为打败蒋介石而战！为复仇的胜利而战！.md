　　[Special Dispatch from this newspaper] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government extends condolences to compatriots along the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan due to Chiang's breach of faith in releasing water to return to the old course, stating:

　　The Kuomintang reactionaries have once again torn up the Shanghai Agreement and released all the Yellow River water to flood us. Our compatriots in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, who have suffered the ravages of Chiang's bandit army, are now facing an even more severe Yellow River flood specially made by the Chiang family government! Such heinous and anti-people behavior is unprecedented. Before this monstrous crime was realized, they constantly destroyed dikes and plundered materials, fearing that the water would not cause a disaster. In the past month, they have been frantically bombing both banks of the Yellow River. Not only has the repair work been impossible to carry out, and the residents along the river unable to relocate, but also the continued relief work has been greatly hindered. Their sinister intentions, not happy unless they kill the people, are all too obvious.

　　Recalling the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course over the past year, our people and government in the liberated areas, for the sake of balancing all considerations and minimizing losses, have always been patient and made great efforts and arduous struggles in the face of the Chiang family government signing agreements again and again, and tearing up agreements again and again. In particular, our compatriots in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, despite the difficulty of tools, lack of work rations, and constant killings and destruction, were able to repair the old dikes and organize dangerous works in a short period of time, fighting against the Yellow River water sent by the Chiang family government. This is a rare miracle in the history of river management. Now Chiang's bandits are brazenly disregarding everything, acting recklessly, not only using American planes and weapons to kill their own people, but also using the monstrous Yellow River water to submerge our liberated areas. Their humanity is extinct, reaching the extreme! Those who play with fire will surely be destroyed, and the traitors will eat their own bitter fruit. There is no doubt about it. We must carry forward the great achievements of the past and move forward!

　　Compatriots! Fellow disaster victims! We must know that today's Yellow River flood is inseparable from Chiang's bandit's military offensive. Only by completely defeating the invaders can the management of the Yellow River be successful. Therefore, our urgent task today, disaster relief, self-rescue, and armed self-defense are inseparable. Riverbed residents who have not yet moved should quickly relocate, using all means to repair dikes and rush to rescue them. If it cannot be done during the day, it must be rushed to repair at night. And protect the dikes as much as possible, take up arms, and strictly prevent Chiang's special agents from destroying them. Fight to defeat the offensive of the dictator and traitor, and fight for the victory of revenge! Work hard! We are by no means isolated, and the entire liberated area and the people of the whole country will inevitably further support us.

　　边府慰勉故道沿岸同胞号召抢险自救武装自卫
    为打败蒋介石而战！为复仇的胜利而战！
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府为蒋方违背信义放水归故慰勉冀鲁豫黄河沿岸同胞称：
    国民党反动派现在又一次撕毁上海协议放全部黄水来淹我们了。遭受蒋贼大军蹂躏的我冀鲁豫同胞，今又面临着蒋家政府所特制的更加严重的黄河水灾！像这样穷凶极恶，与民为敌，是史无前例的。在这一滔天罪行实现以前，他们即曾不断破坏堤岸，掠夺器材，惟恐水不成灾。最近一月以来，更加对黄河两岸疯狂轰炸。不但使修复工程无法进行，沿河居民不能迁移，即继续救济工作亦大受阻碍。其用心狠毒，不杀人民不快，是再明显也没有的了。
    回想一年以来的黄河归故问题，我们解放区的人民和政府为兼其并顾，为少受损失，在蒋家政府一次一次签订协议、又一次一次撕毁协议的情况下，始终委曲隐忍并尽了极大努力艰苦斗争。尤其我冀鲁豫区的同胞，在工具困难、工粮缺乏，而又不时遭到残杀、破坏的情况下，终能于短短时间修补旧堤，整理险工，与蒋家政府送来的黄水搏斗，这在治河历史上是少有的奇迹。今蒋贼竟悍然不顾，肆意妄为，不仅用美国飞机武器杀本国的人民，更用滔天黄水来淹没我解放区，人性绝灭，至于此极！玩火者必灭顶，卖国贼将自食其果，是毫无疑义的。我们要发扬过去的伟迹，更向前进！
    同胞们！灾胞们！我们要知道：今天的黄河水灾，与蒋贼的军事进攻是分不开的。必须彻底打败进攻者，治黄才有成功之可言。所以我们今天的迫切任务，抢险自救与武装自卫是分不开的。还未迁移的河床居民，要找空军迅速迁移，以一切办法修堤抢险，白天不能，要夜间抢修。并要尽可能保护堤坝，拿起武器来，严防蒋特破坏。为打败独夫民贼的进攻而战，为复仇的胜利而战！努力吧！我们决不是孤立的，整个解放区以及全国的人民都必然的要更进一步支援我们。
