    Shi Zhenming Team Cooperative Organizes Mass Production
    Earning Over One Million Yuan in Two Years

    [This report from Taiyue, 27th] The "Yixin Sheng Farmers' Cooperative" of the Shi Zhenming United Mutual Aid Team in Fushan organized mass production, sold the labor products of its members, supplied the daily needs of its members, and developed over two years, earning over one million yuan. The cooperative was founded in July 1944 with shares of 110,000 yuan from the village's leading masses. At that time, it only bought and sold consumer goods and had no connection with the labor mutual aid groups or weaving groups. In October 1945, after replacing Chen Chuankui, an accountant who looked down on production and was not democratic, the Yixin Sheng Farmers' Cooperative reopened. It corrected its past errors in separating itself from the masses in its business policy, truly followed the mass line, and focused on organizing mass production, serving the labor mutual aid groups and weaving groups, and serving the broad masses of farmers. The cooperative became the purchasing agent and sales organization for the mutual aid groups and weaving groups, providing work vouchers and labor exchange accounts. When there was a grain shortage in February of last year, it lent grain to group members like Guo Ling and Wang Baolu who had no grain to eat. When Hu Wenlin's transportation team in Yuantou lacked capital, the cooperative lent them twelve shi of rice. It bought sixty plows and supplied them to mutual aid groups such as Zhang Wanhe's, without making any profit. At the end of March, after settling accounts, every yuan earned a dividend of 50%, excluding all expenses. The masses had an even better impression of the cooperative, saying, "The cooperative not only serves the masses, but also makes money." The old hero Shi Zhenming further promoted the cooperative he led. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the masses re-electing agricultural association cadres, he also reformed the cooperative and made the accounts clear to the masses, posting detailed lists. As a result, the masses not only did not vote out the cooperative cadres, but also elected the accountant Zhao Rongxin as deputy manager and Zhang Zuowu as manager. The cadres gained the trust of the masses, and everyone's morale was even higher. In April 1946, during wheat weeding, the cooperative sold seventy hoes to the masses, selling them fifty yuan cheaper than the market price. It also bought fifty good hoes and sold them at cost, rewarding the poorest and most active group members in the mutual aid groups, charging only 50 yuan per hoe, payable whenever they wanted. The market price for piglets was 600 yuan per jin, but the cooperative sold them to mutual aid group members for only 200 yuan per jin, even cheaper for military families. A total of twenty-seven piglets were sold, saving the masses 75,000 yuan. Every household in the mutual aid groups raised pigs, with Hu Delin's group having seventeen piglets. When changing into lighter clothing, dyes were expensive, costing 400 yuan to dye black, which could only dye eight chi of cloth, averaging 50 yuan per chi. The cooperative then opened a dyeing workshop, dyeing dark blue cloth for only 30 yuan per chi. During the autumn harvest, over one hundred sickles were bought from Yangcheng and sold to the mutual aid groups at cost. The cooperative also took out 180,000 yuan to buy over 3,800 jin of cotton and lent it to the weaving groups. Later, the cooperative distributed cotton and collected cloth. The First and Third Districts allowed transportation teams to transport public grain and also bought low-priced cotton for weaving, saving labor. This year, after five account settlements, dividends were distributed each time, totaling a profit of 1,070,000 yuan over two years. Subsequently, their business content is to provide whatever the people need. They are now preparing to open tofu and other workshops, develop sideline businesses, continue to supply agricultural tools to mutual aid groups, and increase hand-operated weaving machines for weaving groups.

    石振明队合作社组织群众生产
    两年盈利百余万元
    【本报太岳廿七日电】浮山石振明联合互助大队“一心盛农民合作社”组织群众生产，销售社员劳动产品，供给社员日常需要，发展两年，盈利百余万元。该合作社系卅三年七月集合该村、带头群众股金十一万元创办的，当时只买卖消费品，和劳动互助组，纺织组没有联系。三十四年十月，换了轻视生产不民主的会计陈传奎，一心盛农民合作社重新开张，改正过去脱离群众的错误营业方针，真正走群众路线，中心放在组织群众生产上，为劳动互助组，纺织组服务，为广大农民群众服务，合作社便成为互助组、纺织组的买办和销售机关，给互助组印工票和变工账等。去年二月间粮食困难时，借给没粮吃的组员郭龄、王保禄等粮食；垣头胡问林运输队没资本，合作社就借给他十二石米；买铧六十张供给张万合等互助组，不赚一点利。到三月底结账时，除去一切开支每元还赚红利五毛，群众对合作社反映更好，都说：“合作社不只为群众服务，还能赚钱”。老英雄石振明把自己领导的合作社往前推进一步，趁群众改选农会干部机会，也把合作社改造一下，并把账目给群众一个明白，贴清单宣布。结果群众不但没把社内干部选掉，并且把会计赵荣新选成副经理，把张作武选做正经理，干部取得了群众信任，大家情绪就更高涨了。三十五年四月锄麦时，给群众卖锄七十张，锄价比市上少卖五十元，又买了五十张好锄，按本出卖，奖励互助组里最贫苦劳动最积极的组员，每张只收洋五十元，啥时要钱啥时给。市上卖猪娃每斤六百元，社内卖给互助组员每斤只二百元，军属买更便宜，共卖出猪娃二十七个，给群众省洋七万五千元。互助组家家户户养猪，胡得林等互助组有小猪十七个。换夹衣时颜料正贵每个煮黑四百元，只能染布八尺，每尺平均五十元，合作社便办染坊，染深蓝布一尺只要三十元。秋收时到阳城买回镰一百余张，照原本卖给互助组；合作社又拿出十八万元，买棉花三千八百余斤，贷给纺织组，后来合作社又放花收布。一、三区交纳公粮让运输队转运脚价，同时给纺织又买到低价的花，并节省了民力。本年一月经过五次结账，每期都分得红利，两年共获利一百零七万元。继之他们的营业内容是老百姓需要什么就办什么。现在准备开豆腐等作坊，发展副业继续给互助组调剂农具，给纺织组增加手拉梭织布机。
