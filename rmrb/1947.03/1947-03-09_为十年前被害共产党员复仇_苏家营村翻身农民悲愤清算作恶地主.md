　　To avenge the Communist Party member murdered ten years ago:
    The liberated peasants of Sujiaying Village bitterly settle accounts with the evil landlord
    [This Newspaper, Weixian, 7th] The peasants of Sujiaying, Julu County, are settling accounts for the ten years of blood debts of feudal landlords, solemnly reburying the martyrs. During the land revolution in the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936], the Communist Party members of Sujiaying, Julu County, fought against the feudal landlords for the survival of the suffering peasants. The landlord Meng Cunyou and others secretly reported the Communist Party members of Sujiaying to the Hebei-based old government that summer. After several encirclements of the village, more than ten people were arrested, including Zhang Yujin, the head of the county's Communist Youth League organization, Meng Qingzeng, a branch committee member, and guerrilla Chen Xuenian. As a result, seven of them died heroically. The following year, in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, Chen Baogong's father was forced to death by Meng Cunyou's debt collection. This matter was suppressed for ten years. In this grievance session, the masses first demanded to settle this blood debt. At the grievance meeting, more than 20 victimized households and the families of the deceased cried bitterly, recounting their sufferings. Everyone in the audience shed tears. In an instant, grief turned into anger. Shouts filled the meeting, and everyone resolved to thoroughly settle accounts with the evildoers to comfort the dead.
