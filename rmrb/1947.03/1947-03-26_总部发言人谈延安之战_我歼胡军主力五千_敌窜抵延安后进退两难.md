    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 24th. A spokesperson for the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army met with reporters today in a certain location in Northern Shaanxi, stating: In this battle to defend Yan'an, our army inflicted 5,000 casualties on the enemy at a very small cost, and killed He Qi, the commander of their 48th Brigade. The spokesperson pointed out: The Hu Zongnan army's attacking forces were all lightly equipped, advancing through uninhabited wilderness mountains, so their forces were very tired. The 53rd Brigade and 61st Brigade of their 90th Division suffered the heaviest losses, and the 90th Division is one of the two main divisions of Hu's army. Hu's army was divided into left and right groups. The right group, led by Dong Zhao, consisted of three brigades of the 1st Division, two brigades of the 90th Division, and two brigades of the 27th Division. The left group, led by Liu Kan, consisted of two brigades of the 36th Division, two brigades of the 17th Division, two brigades of the 76th Division, and one brigade of the 15th Division. It was truly a desperate gamble, bringing out all their belongings. Because Xi'an was empty, Chiang Kai-shek urgently transferred the 10th Division under Luo Qingwen from Sichuan and Hubei from afar. The spokesperson said: After Hu's army fled to Yan'an, the Kuomintang propaganda machine spread rumors, saying that they had eliminated 10,000 of our troops, and that Hu's army had advanced to Anding, Qingjian, etc., which is complete nonsense. As of the 22nd, Hu's army had not dared to move a step forward from Yan'an. If Hu Zongnan really captured 10,000 of us, then please publish the list like our Xinhua Broadcasting Station, but do not forge it, otherwise it will prove that he is completely fabricating rumors. The spokesperson pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek lost more than 60 divisions (brigades) of troops and then opened up this new battlefield, trapping Hu Zongnan's main force of 14 brigades here, the strategic stupidity is very obvious. But in order to "boost morale," there is no way not to do so, which is called being in a dilemma. Now that they have invaded, they cannot retreat, and advancing will only get them deeper. In short, it is even more of a dilemma. Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan are very happy now, but this kind of happiness is short-lived, please see the precedent of Chiang Kai-shek occupying Linyi; the officers and soldiers of the Jiang-Hu army will soon know that the only way to return to their hometown alive is to lay down their weapons.

    总部发言人谈延安之战
    我歼胡军主力五千
    敌窜抵延安后进退两难
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】人民解放军总部发言人今日在陕北某地接见记者称：此次保卫延安之战，我军以极小代价使敌人伤亡五千，并击毙其四十八旅旅长何奇。发言人指出：胡宗南军进攻部队全系轻装，从无人荒山中开路前进，故其兵力非常疲劳，其九十师之五十三旅六十一旅损失最重，而九十师乃是胡军两个主力师之一。胡军分左右两集团，右集团董钊率第一师三个旅、九十师两个旅、二十七师两个旅、左集团刘戡率三十六师两个旅、十七师两个旅、七十六师两个旅及十五师之一个旅；真是孤注一掷，全部家当都搬出来了。由于西安空虚，蒋介石急从四川、湖北把第十师罗庆文部老远调来。发言人说：胡军窜抵延安之后，国民党宣传机关大肆造谣，说消灭我军一万人，又说胡军已进抵安定、清涧等等，完全是一派胡说。至二十二日止的消息，胡军尚未敢由延安前进一步。如果胡宗南真是俘虏我们一万人，就请他像我们新华广播电台一样把名单公布出来，但不许伪造，否则就证明他是完全造谣。发言人指出：蒋介石于损失了六十多师（旅）兵力之后，再来开辟这个新战场，把胡宗南主力十四个旅陷死在这里，战略的愚蠢是很显然的。但为了“振奋士气”，又无法不这样做，这叫做进退维谷。现在打进来了，退是不能退的了，进就陷得更深。总之，就是更加进退维谷。蒋介石、胡宗南现在很高兴，但此种高兴是短命的，请看蒋介石占领临沂的前例；蒋胡军的官兵很快就会知道，若要生还故乡，唯有放下武器。
