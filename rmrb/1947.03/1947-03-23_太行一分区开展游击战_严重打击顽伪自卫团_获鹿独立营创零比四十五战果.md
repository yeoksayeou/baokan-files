The First Sub-district of Taihang Launches Guerrilla Warfare
Seriously打击顽伪自卫团
Huolu Independent Battalion Achieves a Zero to Forty-Five Victory

[Reported by this newspaper] To coordinate with the Pinghan Northern Section campaign, the troops of the First Sub-district of Taihang launched continuous guerrilla and sabotage warfare in February, achieving victory. A part of the sub-district's core troops, combined with the local armed forces of Jingxing and Huolu, began to operate actively in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang and along the Zhengtai Railway at the beginning of the month. The compatriots in the occupied areas welcomed them and nodded in praise. From the 2nd to the 20th, in nineteen days, they fought eighteen battles, killing, wounding, and capturing eighty-one stubborn and puppet soldiers, capturing one hundred and sixty puppet Bao chiefs and self-defense regiment leaders, destroying three pillboxes, three wooden bridges, and seizing over ten thousand catties of electric wire. This attack打击顽伪军 and the Baojia self-defense regiments, greatly helping the development of work in Jing and Huolu, forced the Zhengtai transportation to be cut off for three days, and Shijiazhuang was shaken. According to statistics, in February, the entire sub-district fought more than sixty battles of various sizes, killing, wounding, and capturing more than three hundred stubborn and puppet soldiers and puppet Bao chiefs and self-defense regiment leaders, destroying four pillboxes, three bridges, two miles of railway, seizing more than thirteen thousand catties of electric wire, five hundred and sixty catties of rail spikes, sixty-four rails, eighty-five utility poles, more than twenty horses, and many other military supplies such as rifles, submachine guns, bullets, and bayonets.

Judging from the enemy situation in the sub-district in February, the 95th and 96th Regiments of the 32nd Division of the Third Army and the 19th, 20th, and 21st Regiments of the Seventh Division, originally stationed in Shijiazhuang and its suburbs, were successively transferred north to reinforce at the end of January and the beginning of February. After our attack, Shijiazhuang and Zhengtai felt threatened and had to rush back to their original defenses in mid-February, robbing Peter to pay Paul, and their lack of troops became increasingly apparent. During this period, the defense of Shijiazhuang was weak. To prevent our "digging out the heart" tactics, strict vigilance was enforced and defenses were strengthened. Therefore, the construction of a railway around Shijiazhuang began on February 5th. Yuan氏 and Liangdu (Jingxing) and other places also added outer moat walls, but the city ring road was difficult to establish due to a lack of materials, and was forced to stop after building a quarter of the northwest corner. Another defense method was to take the offensive as a defense, instigating the home-returning corps to penetrate deep into our rear areas to harass, seize livestock, and抢粮, intensify activities to disrupt our social order, and achieve the effect of defense. According to observation, this kind of activity of taking the offensive as a defense and raiding our weak areas may continue in the future, but our side has raised vigilance, so the struggle against raids and抢夺 and anti-conscription will gradually become more intense.

[Reported by this newspaper from Huolu] Since the stubborn puppets invaded our Huolu liberated area at the end of last month, the home-returning corps have been抢粮抓丁 everywhere, and the people have suffered unspeakable pain. To protect the masses, the county's independent battalion ambushed on the northwest mountain of Donggou on the 3rd of this month. At 9:00 a.m., more than fifty members of the Huolu city home-returning corps militia swaggered to Shuiyu to loot. We immediately surrounded the village in three routes and annihilated all the enemies. In total, thirty people including the head of the home-returning corps were captured alive, fifteen were killed or wounded, one light machine gun, thirty-four rifles and short guns, nine hundred and seven rounds of ammunition, more than seven hundred catties of粮食, twenty-seven head of livestock, and a part of other military supplies were seized. We suffered no casualties. (Zhu Lan)

    太行一分区开展游击战
    严重打击顽伪自卫团
    获鹿独立营创零比四十五战果
    【本报讯】太行一分区部队为配合平汉北段作战，二月份连续展开游击破击战，获得胜利。分区基干兵团一部，结合井（陉）获（鹿）地方武装，于月初即开始活跃于石家庄市郊及正太沿线，沦陷区同胞纷纷迎接，额首称庆。自二日至廿日十九天内作战十八次，毙伤俘顽伪军八十一人，俘伪保长自卫团长以下一百六十人，破毁碉堡三座，木桥三座，获电线一万余斤。此次出击打击了顽伪军与保甲自卫团，予开展井、获工作以莫大帮助，迫使正太交通断绝三天，石庄为之震动。据统计全分区二月份总计大小战斗六十余次，毙伤俘顽伪军及伪保长自卫团长以下三百余人，破毁碉堡四座，桥梁三座，铁路二里，破获电线一万三千余斤，道钉五百六十斤，道轨六十四根，电杆八十五根，缴马二十余匹，其他缴步马枪、子弹、刺刀等军用品甚多。
    综观二月份该分区敌情为原驻石庄及市郊之第三军三十二师九五、九六团及第七师十九、二十、二十一三个团，于一月底二月初陆续北调增援。当我出击之后，石庄、正太感受威胁，不得不在二月中旬急忙调回原防，挖肉补疮，捉襟见肘，其兵力之不足益形明显。在此期间，石庄守备薄弱，为防我挖心战术，遂严行警戒，加强守卫，故在二月五日开始修筑环石铁路，元氏、良都（井陉）等地亦加修外壕围墙，但环市路终因器材缺乏难以筹设，于修起西北角之四分之一段后被迫停工；其另一守卫方式则是以攻为守，唆使还乡团深入我腹地袭扰，牵牲口、抢粮，加紧活动，以紊乱我社会秩序，收防卫之效。据观察今后此种以攻为守、奔袭我薄弱地区之活动还可能继续，然我方已提高警惕，故奔袭及反抢夺反抓丁斗争将渐趋激烈。（纯一）
    【本报获鹿讯】自上月底顽伪向我获鹿解放区进犯后，还乡团到处抢粮抓丁，人民痛苦不堪。该县独立营为保卫群众，于本月三日设伏洞沟西北山上，上午九时获鹿城还乡团壮丁队五十余人大摇大摆的到水峪抢掠。我当即分三路把村包围，将敌全部歼灭。计：生俘还乡团团长以下三十人，毙伤十五人，缴轻机枪一挺、长短枪三十四支、子弹九百零七发、粮食七百多斤、牲口二十七头，其他军用品一部。我无伤亡。（朱烂）
