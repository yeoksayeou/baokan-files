[Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue, 12th] Special-class hero Jiao Wubao responded to the call to "Perform Meritorious Service for the People" in defense of Yan'an, taking the lead in motivating everyone to develop merit plans. He has achieved "everyone making a plan, everyone determined." The annual merit plan set by Jiao Wubao's mutual aid group and his ninth squad is as follows: 1. Eliminate two enemy squads to one platoon, ensuring the entire squad is equipped with new weapons. 2. Cultivate two to three enemy-killing heroes. 3. The entire squad must be united, genuinely warm and friendly, without quarrels or disagreements, helping each other. Criticize each other for shortcomings, and solve problems together. 4. Resolutely execute orders, overcome all difficulties in any environment, and complete tasks. 5. Guarantee no violations of the policy on prisoners of war and mass discipline, truly implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. Learn from the military-civilian relations of the Seventh Company and Pei Zhongyi. 6. Ensure that new comrades are brought to the battlefield in every battle. 7. Seize every opportunity to study, constantly improving political understanding and military skills. Overcome all bad tendencies and ensure that the squad's name is not on the record book. Guarantee that the entire squad's average grenade throwing distance is above 31 meters.

[Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue, 12th] Since the launch of the Jiao Wubao movement in Unit 407, the Eighth Company of the Liberation Detachment has produced a second "Jiao Wubao" – Kong Zhaoxiang. He is also a new soldier who enlisted last year and has been commended by the battalion in the Pinghan Line and Yicheng battles. Responding to the call to launch the Jiao Wubao movement, he is determined to emulate Jiao Wubao, mobilizing his mutual aid group to challenge Jiao Wubao's group. He guarantees that there will be no deserters in his group, that he can lead all new soldiers in combat, and that he can complete every combat mission. He often patiently and actively persuades and specifically helps the new soldiers in his squad. During marches, he often carries extra weight for others. During breaks, he often takes the initiative to cook and boil water. He pays particular attention to mass discipline. With his help, not only have all the soldiers in the squad corrected their faults, but they are also particularly grateful to him. In the defense of Liu Huangling, he demonstrated the spirit of courage and mutual assistance in completing the task. When he accepted the task of repelling the enemy's counterattack from his superiors, he took the initiative to encourage new soldiers such as Liu Yongheng. In battle, he closely led his mutual aid group, boosting everyone's courage, finding terrain, and leading new soldiers such as Zhang Wenxue in charging the enemy. When he was chasing the enemy to seize a machine gun, he was unfortunately wounded in his left arm, but he still helped others collect three guns before leaving the battlefield. With such a heroic spirit of mutual assistance, everyone affectionately calls him the second Jiao Wubao.

[Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue, 12th] A unit of the Liberation Detachment held a military meeting on the 4th, summarizing 136 model soldiers in training and enemy-killing heroes in the Yu-Xi campaign, including Kong Zhaoxiang and 11 others who were awarded first-class merit, and Zhang Mingzhu and 27 others who were awarded second-class merit. In addition to being recorded in the regimental merit book, material rewards were distributed separately, and merit commendation letters were sent to their families. The remaining 96 people were given verbal commendations and had their merits recorded in the company and battalion merit books respectively. In addition, 15 model machine gun squads, rifle squads, and mutual aid groups were all commended with photographs. The Wu Bingchen squad of the First Company of a certain unit was selected as a model training squad. The Wu Bingchen squad proposed that "Only when everyone is united can there be a high tide in training," which promoted a training upsurge in the entire squad and company. Through hard training, the entire squad's grenade throwing distance increased from 23 meters to more than 30 meters now. In the regimental test, it was awarded the model squad for the second time.

    焦五保订出立功计划
    解放支队奖励杀敌英雄孔兆祥等
    【本报太岳十二日电】特等英雄焦五保响应保卫延安“为民立功”的号召，自己并推动大家制订立功计划。已作到“人人订计划，个个下决心”。焦五保互助组和他的第九班订出的全年立功计划如下：一、消灭敌人两班至一个排，保证全班都换成新式武器。二、要培养出两个至三个杀敌英雄。三、全班团结，确实作到亲亲热热，不吵架，不闹意见，互相帮助。谁有缺点互相批评，谁有困难大家解决。四、执行命令，坚决在任何环境下排除一切困难，完成任务。五、保证不违犯俘虏政策和群众纪律，确实作到三大纪律、八项注意。向七连和裴中义的军民关系学习。六、保证每次战斗都能把新同志带上战场。七、抓紧一切空隙进行学习，不断提高政治认识和军事技术。克服一切不良倾向，保证记过簿上没有班里的名字。保证全班投弹平均三十一公尺以上。
    【本报太岳十二日电】四○七部自展开焦五保运动后，解放支队八连又出现了第二个“焦五保”——孔兆祥。他也是去年入伍的新战士，在平汉线和翼城战役中都受到过营里的表扬。他响应开展焦五保运动的号召，决心要向焦五保看齐，动员他的互助组同焦五保组挑战。保证本组没有逃亡的，能带领所有新战士作战，能完成每个战斗任务。他对本班新战士经常自动的耐心劝说和具体帮助。行军中，他常替别人多担东西，休息时他自己也常抢着去作饭烧水。尤其注意群众纪律。全班战士在他的帮助下，不但都改正了毛病，并特别感激他。刘黄岭的守卫战，他更表现了勇敢互助完成任务的精神，当他接受了上级的反扑敌人的任务时，他便自动找新战士刘永恒等进行鼓动。战斗中，他紧紧的带着自己的互助组，给大家壮胆、找地形，并带领新战士张文学等向敌冲锋。当他追击敌人夺取机枪时，不幸左臂负了伤，还架着别的彩号，替他们搞了三支枪，才下了战场。他有这样的英勇互助的精神，大家都感动的称他为第二个焦五保。
    【本报太岳十二日电】解放支队某部于四日召开军人大会，总结出练兵中的模范者，及豫西作战中的杀敌英雄一百三十六名，其中孔兆祥等十二名立了头功，张明珠等二十八名立了二等功。除登记在团功劳簿上外，并分别发给物质奖励，给其家中寄去报功单。其余九十六位作了口头表扬，分别在连营功劳簿上记功。此外，尚有十五个模范的机枪班、步枪班、互助小组，一律以照像表扬。某部一连吴丙辰班当选为练兵模范班，吴丙辰班在练兵运动中提出“只有大家团结好，练兵才会有高潮”，推动了全班全连的练兵热潮。在苦练下，全班投弹由二十三公尺，提高到现在的三十余公尺。在全团的测验上，第二次荣膺模范班。
