Responding to the Call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to Perform Meritorious Service for the People
Jinnan Workers Increase Production Through Competition

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] After seeing the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' call to vigorously carry out the production movement, the Jinnan District workers convened a symposium of cadres from directly subordinate factory trade unions. On the one hand, they summarized the recent three-month production upsurge, and on the other hand, they resolved to continue to work hard to increase production to support the patriotic self-defense war and learn from the spirit of the Taihang factories' enthusiastic dedication to work. Comrade Liu Zhiming of the Third Bomb Factory invented a donkey-pulled rotary machine, saving the labor of four people. In the production blitz in December of last year, the Second and Third Bomb Factories created a peak record of an average of ××× hand grenades per person per day. Last winter, the clothing factory saved 20,000 square feet of cloth, worth 850,000 yuan, when cutting cotton-padded clothes. Implementing an "two-eight split" profit sharing system, workers received 170,000 yuan. This year, they plan to save × sets when cutting unlined garments. Tian Kunshan, the chairman of the trade union, re-mobilized at the workers' meeting and called for a new wave of competition through challenges between classes to perform meritorious service for the people. The garment-cutting class took the lead, starting work on the fifth day of the first lunar month; initially, each table produced 71 sets per day, now it produces more than 150 sets, more than doubling the output, and they compete with each other. Wu Zhanbiao rises early and works until dark, making more than a hundred extra sets every day. Comrade Zhang Jingbo, who is over fifty years old, continues to work even with swollen hands. Sewing worker Zhang Changyin used to produce ten sets a day, now he produces sixteen sets. They guarantee that their class of five frames will complete eighty sets every day. Workers throughout the factory are striving for the title of model class, with the following conditions: (1) Complete on time, (2) Quality according to upper-level regulations, (3) Dimensions according to vehicle area regulations, neither too large nor too small. Workers in the printing industry are also not lagging behind. For example, after the Jinnan Daily was changed to a daily publication, the typesetting room used to have three workers, which was later reduced to two. Now, Comrade Shao Yulin, the chairman of the trade union, personally goes down to typeset, further reducing it to one and a half people, taking trainees, and still able to complete the task on time. In the past, it took four shifts to finish the work, but now it is printed out before 12 o'clock every day. The administrative office printing plant uses the method of "the machine doesn't rest, even if the people do," and now prints an average of 1,750 copies of grain coupons per day, ensuring the needs of the front lines and facilitating the calculation of the administrative office's financial and grain figures. Currently, the printing industry trade union is preparing a small newspaper jointly produced by the newspaper, bookstore, and administrative office printing plant to exchange experiences and welcome new tasks.

　　响应总工会号召为民立功
    冀南职工竞赛增产
    【本报特讯】冀南区职工见到边区职工总会大力开展生产运动的号召后，便召集各直属工厂职工会干部座谈会，一方面对最近三月来生产热潮作了总结，一方面决心今后要继续努力增加生产量，支援爱国自卫战争，学习太行各厂职工热烈献工的精神。炸弹三所刘致明同志发明驴拉旋把机，节省四个人的工，炸弹二所、三所在去年十二月份生产突击中，创造每人每天平均能产×××个手榴弹的最高记录。去冬被服厂裁棉衣时，即已节约布二万方尺，值洋八十五万元，实行二八分红制，工人分得十七万元。今年裁单衣时计划节约×万套。工会主任田昆山在工人大会上重新动员号召用各班挑战的方式掀起新的竞赛热潮，为人民立功。裁衣班首起带头作作，正月初五便开了工；开始一天每个案子出七十一套，现在出到一百五十余套，增加一倍以上，并相互比赛。吴占标黎明即起，直干到黑，每天能多作百多套。五十多岁的张静波同志把手累肿了，还不停工。缝衣工人张长印过去每天能出十套，现在出到十六套。他们保证本班五个架子，每天要完成八十套。全厂工人为争取模范班而努力，其条件：（一）按期完成，（二）质量按上级规定，（三）尺寸按车区规定，不能或大或小。印刷界职工也不落后，如冀南日报改为日刊后，排字房过去是三个工人，后减到两个，现在工会主任邵玉林同志亲自下去排字，又减到一个半人，带着练习生，仍能按期完成任务。过去四个班还要拖延，现每天不到十二点钟就印出来了。行署印刷厂用“憩人不憩机”办法，现在平均每天印粮票一千七百五十份，保证了前方的需要，便利了行署财粮数目的计算。现印刷界职工会为交流经验，由报社、书店、行署印刷厂共出一个小报，来迎接新的任务。
