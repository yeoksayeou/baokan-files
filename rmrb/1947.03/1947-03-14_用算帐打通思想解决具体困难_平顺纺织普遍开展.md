Using Accounting to Open Up Thinking and Solve Specific Difficulties
　　Widespread Textile Production in Pingshun
　　[This Newspaper's News] Comprehensive Dispatch from Correspondents: Pingshun is universally developing the textile movement using specific accounting methods to open up thinking and solve technical and tool problems. Yang Qiutao of Xingcheng Village in the Seventh District was willing to form a mutual aid group with textile expert Li Jin'e, but her mother-in-law did not want her to weave. So they held a family meeting at her home. First, taking Su Zhiping as an example, they calculated that she could spin five liang of cotton per day, and after two months, she could weave it into cloth and sell it for 33,000 yuan, netting a profit of 25,500 yuan, enough to buy 20 shi and 7 dou and 5 sheng of grain, which is more than the annual harvest. After her mother-in-law's thinking was opened up, she happily allowed Qiutao to join the textile group. The masses in Zhengshui Village in the Second District said, "Planting six mu of land is not enough for three people to change seasons; weaving is more profitable." The literacy class for women in Yangjingdi changed to meeting once every five days, with the content focusing on the study of textile technology. Each group set a plan, with commendations and merits used as materials for future hero elections. When sixty-year-old woman Liu Xiaogou weaved for the first time, her husband shook the thread for her. An old woman mobilized her daughter-in-law, saying, "I can take care of the children and cook; you should weave quickly!" The Nansai sub-district in the Second District organized twenty-six carpenters using a contracting method, guaranteeing a blitz of 43 hand shuttle looms and 213 large spinning wheels in 20 days. The older girls at Xishe Primary School in the Fifth District spend half the day spinning cotton and half the day studying. Cheng Jinshuo, a militiaman from Dongtan Village, learned to spin cotton in addition to practicing martial arts in the morning. In the past twenty-three days, he has spun a total of seven jin, and the 2,800 yuan he earned has been used to buy another seven jin of cotton. Now he can spin ten liang a day.

　　用算帐打通思想解决具体困难
    平顺纺织普遍开展
    【本报讯】综合通讯员报导：平顺各地以具体算帐方法打通思想与解决技术工具问题、纺织运动已普遍开展起来。七区杏城村杨秋桃愿和纺织能手李金娥成立互助组，但她婆婆不愿意叫她纺织，就到她家开家庭会议，首先以苏芝平为例算帐按她每天纺花五两，两个月后织成布，可卖三万三千元，可净赚二万五千五百元，能买粮二十石七斗五，比一年收粮还多。婆婆思想打通后，很高兴的让秋桃参加了纺织组。二区正水村群众说：“种六亩地不够三个人换季，纺织利大。”羊井底妇女识字班改为五天上一次课，内容以研究纺织技术为主，各小组订出计划，以表扬记功作将来选举英雄的材料。六十多岁的老婆刘小狗新织时，老汉给抖线，有个老太婆动员媳妇说：“我能看孩子做饭，你快纺吧！”二区南赛小区以包工办法组织了廿六个木匠工人，保证廿天突击手拉梭机四十三架，大纺车二百一十三辆。五区西社小学较大的女生是半天纺花，半天念书。东弹村民兵程金锁早晨除练武外还学会了纺花，二十三天来共纺了七斤，所赚的二千八百元又买下七斤花，现在他一整天能纺十两。
