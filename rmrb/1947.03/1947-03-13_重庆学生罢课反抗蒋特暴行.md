　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Chongqing dispatch: The patriotic anti-brutality surge of Chongqing students has not been deterred by the "February 5th" and "February 8th" bloody incidents manufactured by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. To protest the brutality of the special agents, Chongqing University, Women's Normal College, and Rural Construction College went on strike on the 10th of last month, and the Sichuan Provincial College of Education and Municipal No. 1 Middle School went on strike on the 11th. The Anti-Union Presidium, in an emergency meeting on the 11th, decided to call on all schools in the city to strike for three days starting on the 12th. During the strike, the Presidium will petition Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters, demanding a thorough investigation into the masterminds behind the two major bloody incidents, the handover and severe punishment of the murderers, otherwise the schools will continue to strike. It also called on students in schools across the country to strike, teachers to strike, and industry and commerce to strike, to appeal to the World Student Federation, and to submit a memorandum to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. On the afternoon of the same day, more than 100 representatives from people's organizations and all walks of life in Chongqing gathered to discuss supporting the students' patriotic movement. They decided to establish a support association for the bloody incidents on the spot, raise funds to solve the financial difficulties of the anti-brutality movement, and passed a letter to the compatriots of the whole country, calling on compatriots across the country to support and participate in the anti-brutality patriotic movement.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: According to TASS Shanghai, 8th: Shanghai student groups gathered to protest against Chiang's secret agents' illegal mass arrest of innocent citizens in Peiping, and the brutal killing of Liang Renda, who participated in the boycott of American goods conference in Shanghai. Many citizens in the streets participated in the gathering, and shouted slogans such as "Develop China's industry and commerce," "Boycott American goods," "Freedom of assembly and association," "Abolish secret service agencies," and "We protest against illegal arrests and defend human rights." The Shanghai Student Union held a press conference at which a petition was read, stating: Shanghai students protested against the U.S. military's continued stationing in China in violation of the 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution. Because the United States mediated in name but aided Chiang in reality, the Chinese civil war has expanded, and the people's suffering has intensified. The Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution on the China issue has been completely destroyed by the United States. China should be independent and autonomous, and can no longer be subjected to American oppression.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: According to a Shanghai newspaper report cited by TASS Shanghai on the 9th: Sixty-six professors from universities in Shanghai issued a declaration supporting the protest of professors from universities in Peiping against the authorities' mass illegal arrests. The declaration demanded the protection of human rights and the cessation of illegal arrests.
