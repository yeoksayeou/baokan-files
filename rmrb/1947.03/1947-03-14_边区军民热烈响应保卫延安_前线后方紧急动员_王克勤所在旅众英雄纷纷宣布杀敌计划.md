　　[This dispatch from the Front Lines of Ji-Lu-Yu on the 12th by our newspaper] The telegram from the Yan'an Mobilization Conference has inspired General Liu Bocheng's troops. On the night of the 9th, the Political Department of the Field Army, after hearing the Yan'an broadcast, immediately convened a meeting of cadres from directly subordinate units to communicate the message, and telegraphed all units overnight, instructing them to urgently mobilize, intensify training, and annihilate more enemies to make contributions to defending Yan'an and protecting Chairman Mao. The next morning, the walls of the headquarters' residence were covered with the telegram from the Yan'an Mobilization Conference. Villagers gathered around, staff explained, and everyone was both indignant and full of confidence. An old man said, "Chiang Kai-shek doesn't want to live, don't blame us for being impolite!" In the evening, a joint military-civilian meeting was held in the residence. Twelve military personnel and civilians spoke in succession. Lu Qingxian, a soldier liberated from the Battle of Juan'nan, said, "Without high mountains, the plains wouldn't stand out. I have deeply understood Chiang Kai-shek's crimes and his dictatorial government must be abolished." Farmer representatives called on the front to intensify the fight against old Chiang, and the rear to intensify efforts to uproot Chiang's foundations. Everyone should work hard, and good days are coming.
    When the news of Hu Zongnan's attack on Yan'an reached the meeting of enemy-killing heroes of the regiment where Wang Keqin was, a raging fire ignited in the heroes' seats. Everyone scrambled to announce their personal plans to kill the enemy. The famous hero Wang Keqin thumped his chest and exclaimed, "I used to be in Chiang Kai-shek's army. Now I am a member of the 1.5 million-strong People's Liberation Army. I fully know that the war of self-defense is for the sake of all the people and for myself. Now, I swear to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all the people of the country that I will do my best to cultivate all the people in my platoon into enemy-killing heroes. Under the leadership of our regimental leaders, we will fight a few more 'Dayang Lake' annihilation battles to protect Chairman Mao and Yan'an; and hope that Chiang's soldiers quickly wake up, lay down their weapons and join the People's Army; only in this way can they liberate their hometowns and turn themselves over. This is the time for us to perform meritorious service for the people!" The heroes also sent a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu to respond to the call: "Commander-in-Chief Zhu: We have heard your call. We vow to cultivate more enemy-killing heroes like Wang Keqin and annihilate more enemies to defend Yan'an, protect Chairman Mao and you; we know that our war of self-defense is for the independence and democracy of the motherland, and for a better life; we believe that Chiang's bandit's offensive will inevitably be crushed by us, and the end of his traitorous and dictatorial rule will inevitably come quickly.”
    [This dispatch from Ji'nan on the 12th by our newspaper] The Ji'nan District Committee of the Communist Party of China has just called on the entire Ji'nan Party, government, military, and civilians to urgently mobilize in response to the Jiang-Hu troops' reckless invasion of Yan'an. All parties should work hard to fight, and the rear should intensify its work to provide strong support to the People's Liberation Army on the Northwest battlefield. We must follow Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call: "We must prepare for a long-term war. If we haven't pushed them out after fighting for a year and a half, we will fight for three to five years" to completely eliminate the Chiang's troops attacking the liberated areas. We must implement land reform, completely eliminate landlords, and completely eliminate extreme poverty, leaving no trace of feudal vestiges, truly enabling landless and land-poor peasants to obtain land and organize armed forces. The seven million peasants of Ji'nan should struggle hard, bravely sacrifice, defend Yan'an, and strive for the victory of national democracy.
    [This dispatch from Ji'nan on the 12th by our newspaper] Upon learning of Chiang's troops' attack on Yan'an, the Ji'nan Military Region and the Ji'nan Military Affairs Committee sent a telegram to the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of people in the Northwest battlefield, encouraging each other with resolute cooperation in combat. It stated: The traitor Chiang Kai-shek expelled the personnel of the Chinese Communist Party Liaison Office from Jing, Hu, and Yu, openly expanding the civil war. Now he is attacking Yan'an with seventeen brigades. We are extremely angered by this news. Recalling that the Jiang-Hu troops have attacked Yan'an twice, and you have repelled them twice, this time Chiang's bandit's attack is actually a desperate struggle. In the face of your incomparably heroic strength, we firmly believe that Chiang Kai-shek's ruling clique will never find the "turning point" he dreams of, but will only accelerate his path to the grave. All the troops and 200,000 militiamen in Ji'nan will resolutely cooperate with you in combat. The final victory must be ours!
    [This special dispatch from our newspaper] The emancipated peasants of Taihang are actively carrying out land investigation and distribution, expanding the People's Liberation Army, and responding to the call to defend Yan'an and Chairman Mao. Along the Baijin and Pinghan lines, the vast number of emancipated peasants in the new districts are flocking to the People's Liberation Army. In sixteen villages in Huguan, 290 young men enlisted in the army in one day. The wave of joining the army is also underway in Wu'an, Shahe, and other places. More than a hundred village cadres and activists in the ninth district of Wu'an, Liuquangou, are holding meetings to discuss thoroughly investigating and distributing land. Hearing that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking Yan'an, they were extremely indignant. Li Fugui, the model cooperative director of Zhaozhuang, said excitedly: "We just overthrew the little Chiang, and now the big Chiang is attacking us with American guns. We have no other way but to unite well and eliminate his 'calamitous army'!" All the peasants expressed that they would perform meritorious service in the land distribution and army recruitment movements. Women's relief cadres from seven villages, including Sanwang Village and Shili Inn, proposed: "Men go to the front to fight the big Chiang, and we women will fight the little Chiang at home!"

　　边区军民热烈响应保卫延安
    前线后方紧急动员
    王克勤所在旅众英雄纷纷宣布杀敌计划
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十二日电】延安动员大会的通电，激励着刘伯承将军的部队。九日夜间，野战军政治部听到延安广播后，立即召开直属队干部会议传达，并连夜电告各部队，训令他们紧急动员起来，加紧练兵，歼灭更多的敌人，为保卫延安与保卫毛主席而立功。次日清晨，总部驻地的墙壁上到处贴着延安动员大会的通电。村民们围看着，工作人员解释着，大家既愤慨又充满了信心。一个老大爷说：“蒋介石自己不想活，不能怪咱们不客气！”晚间召开驻地军民联合大会，军民十二人相续演说，鄄南之役解放过来的战士陆清贤说：“没有高山显不出平地，我已深深知道了蒋介石的罪恶，非取消他的独裁政府不可。”农民代表号召前方加紧打老蒋，后方加紧刨蒋根，大家努一把力，好日子就要来了。
    当胡宗南进攻延安的消息传到王克勤所在旅的杀敌英雄大会上的时候，英雄席上顿时燃起万丈怒火，人人争着宣布个人杀敌计划。著名英雄王克勤拍胸顿足，大声疾呼：“我从前干过国民党的队伍，现在我已是一百五十万人民解放军的一员，我完全知道自卫战争是为着全国老百姓，为着自己。现在，我向毛主席、朱总司令和全国老百姓宣誓，以最大努力把我的一排人都培养成杀敌英雄，在我们旅首长的领导下，再打他几个“大杨湖”歼灭战，保卫毛主席和延安；并希望蒋军士兵们赶快觉悟起来，放下武器到人民军队里来；只有这样才能解放自己的家乡，自己才能翻身。这是我们为人民立功的时候了！”众英雄并驰电朱总司令响应号召：“朱总司令：我们听见了你的号召，我们誓以培养更多的像王克勤一样的杀敌英雄，歼灭更多的敌人，来保卫延安，保卫毛主席和您；我们知道我们的自卫战争是为了祖国的独立、民主，为了更好的生活；我们相信蒋贼的进攻必然被我们粉碎，而其卖国独裁统治的末日也必然迅速到来。”
    【本报冀南十二日电】中共冀南区党委顷就蒋胡军冒险进犯延安事号召全冀南党政军民紧急动员起来。四方努力作战，后方加紧工作，给西北战场人民解放军以有力的配合。必须遵照朱总司令的号召：“我们要准备长期战争，打它一年半年，如果还没有打出去，就打它三年五年”，把进攻解放区的蒋军彻底消灭。要贯彻土地改革，彻底消灭地主，完全消灭赤贫，不遗留任何一点封建尾巴，真正使无地和少地的农民获得土地，组织武装。全冀南七百万农民应艰苦奋斗，英勇牺牲，保卫延安，争取全国民主的胜利。
    【本报冀南十二日电】冀南军区、冀南武委会闻悉蒋军进攻延安，特致电西北战场人民解放军及西北广大人民，以坚决配合作战相勉。略称：卖国贼蒋介石逐出京沪渝中共联络人员，公开扩大内战，现以十七旅之众进攻延安，此间闻讯，万分激怒。回溯蒋胡军两次进攻延安，你们两次将其击退，这次蒋贼进攻，实为垂死挣扎。在你们英勇无比的力量面前，我们坚信蒋介石统治集团绝不会找到他所梦想的“转机”，而只能加速使他走向坟墓。冀南全部军队及二十万民兵，坚决配合你们作战，最后胜利一定是我们的！
    【本报特讯】太行翻身农民积极开展查田分地，扩大人民解放军，响应保卫延安保卫毛主席的战斗号召。白晋、平汉沿线广大新区翻身农民纷纷涌入人民解放军。壶关十六个村庄，一天内即有二百九十名青壮年入伍。武安沙河等地参军浪潮亦正开展中。武安九区柳泉沟百余村干积极分子，正在集会讨论彻底查田分地。听到蒋介石进攻延安，异常愤慨。赵庄模范合作社长李富贵激动地说：“我们刚把小老蒋扳倒，大老蒋又拿着美国枪向咱们进攻来了，俺们没有别的办法，只有好好团结起来消灭他的‘遭殃军’！”全体农民都表示要在分田和参军运动中立功。三王村、十里店等七村妇救干部提出：“男人上前线打大老蒋，我们妇女要在家打小老蒋！”
