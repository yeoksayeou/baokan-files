    Conscription Movement in Xingtai City
    Chen Guang
    From the 7th to the 10th, in just three or four days, the entire city launched an extremely solemn, enthusiastic, and joyous conscription movement, with 574 young adults enlisting in the army. This movement was the first of its kind in Xingtai City, and preliminary summaries yield the following experiences:
    Firstly, this conscription was carried out on the basis of the mass emancipation movement. After the basic masses of Xingtai City were emancipated from the rule of traitors and landlords, their thinking changed. The most obvious reflection of this in the conscription movement was the idea of "thorough emancipation, and protecting emancipation after it is achieved." This shows that the masses have the conscious thought of protecting their own liberation after achieving it, which is the most fundamental condition for forming this conscription movement. In addition, during the distribution of the fruits of struggle, the family members of soldiers were given special preferential treatment and care by the masses, which greatly improved their status and had a significant impact on the thinking of the general emancipated masses.
    Secondly, the approach to this conscription work was completely based on the leadership and work methods of mass consciousness and willingness. Currently, the mass emancipation movement in the city is carrying out a summary in preparation for turning to in-depth work. In the mass emancipation summary, the masses universally discussed the question of "how to protect emancipation and how to protect the fruits." The leadership grasped this ideological requirement of the masses and induced the masses to have a relatively in-depth discussion. During the discussion of this issue, the masses universally raised the demand to join the army. Five militiamen from Xiguan Street in the Second District submitted a "Request to Join the Army to Fight the Traitor Chiang Kai-shek" to the District Government. The masses in many streets proposed "digging up the roots of old poverty and asking the government to call for conscription." According to the demands of the masses, the leadership concentrated these demands and then carried out a general call for conscription. Slogans such as "Joining the army is the most glorious! Digging up the roots of old poverty to make contributions for the people! Welcoming victory and protecting the fruits!" were put forward. Because the masses had made ideological preparations and the general call was put forward appropriately, a strong mass conscription movement was immediately launched. Activists and cadres connected with the masses, the masses connected with the masses, fathers connected with sons, and women connected with husbands, all connecting with each other. The young adults of each street collectively registered to join the army in groups of three or five, with very few individual mobilizations. Therefore, in just two days, 574 people registered in various streets, more than doubling the task. When the broad masses heard that young adults had registered to join the army, they reported the good news to each other and automatically supported the new soldiers. For example, Shi Youmei, a small businessman in Xiguan Street, was already 53 years old. Upon hearing that 20 young adults in his street had registered to join the army, he went to the conscription committee, laughed loudly, went home, took two bottles of white wine and 30 salted eggs, and sent them to the conscription committee to support the new soldiers. After the new soldiers who registered were inspected by the district, each street held a farewell meeting for the new soldiers. In their speeches to the masses, the new soldiers rarely mentioned family difficulties, and all expressed their firm will of "not returning home until Chiang's army is defeated." The family members of the new soldiers were all instructing their sons and husbands to fight well against Chiang Kai-shek on the front lines. Liu Xueshi, a woman, sent her husband to the front lines and said, "You fight well in the front, firmly dig up the roots of poverty; I will spin yarn and weave cloth and plant rich seedlings in the rear, and after planting rich seedlings, I will support the front lines." Dozens of people at a time spoke on stage at the farewell, recounting the suffering inflicted by Chiang Kai-shek and instructing the new soldiers to fight well against the traitor. When it came to preferential treatment for military families, the women said, "From now on, anything that needs sewing will be our job." The children said, "Anything that needs running around will be our job." Many people volunteered to take care of certain military families.
    Thirdly, the screening of new soldiers. Because it was emphasized that "it must be a voluntary army" when making the call for conscription, and the masses also proposed "do not allow those under struggle or bad elements to join the army, they will not protect us with guns in their hands" during the discussion of conscription, the vast majority of those who registered this time were good, and the screening work was carried out relatively easily. After screening by the masses and the leadership, among the young adults who joined the army, farmers (most of whom were emancipated farmers) accounted for 33.5%, workers in various industries (including factory workers, handicraft workers, apprentices, masons, carpenters, etc.) accounted for 27%, shop assistants accounted for 12.4%, and poor urban residents and small businessmen accounted for 32.7%. From a political quality perspective: Communists accounted for 14.3%, street cadres accounted for 8%, and militiamen accounted for 68%. From these two statistics, it can be seen that the quality is good.

    邢台市的参军运动
    陈光
    从七号到十号三四天的时间里，全市掀起了一个极其庄严热烈、欢喜愉快的参军运动，有五百七十四个青壮年报名参军。这个运动在邢台市还是第一次，初步总结有以下一些经验。
    首先这次参军是在群众翻身运动的基础上进行的。邢市基本群众从奸霸、地主的统治下翻身后，他们的思想上就起了变化，在这次参军运动中反映最明显的，就是“翻身要翻彻底，翻身之后还要保卫翻身”的思想。这说明群众具有自己得到解放还要保卫自己解放的思想自觉，这是形成这次参军运动的最基本的条件。另外，在分配斗争果实中，对于军属经过群众进行了特别优待与照顾，大大提高了军属地位，给予一般翻身群众思想上的影响也是很重大的。
    其次，在这次参军工作的作法上，是完全采取了群众自觉自愿的领导方法与工作方法。目前全市群众翻身运动正是进行小结准备转向深入，在群众的翻身小结里，群众讨论普遍提出了“如何保卫翻身，如何保卫果实”的问题。领导上抓住了群众这一思想要求，诱导群众作了比较深入的讨论。在这问题讨论中，群众普遍提出参军的要求，二区西关街五个民兵向区政府上《请求参军去打卖国贼蒋介石书》，许多街的群众提出“挖老穷根，要求政府号召参军。”根据群众这个要求，领导上把它集中起来，才进行参军的一般号召。提出“参军最光荣！刨老穷根为老百姓立功！迎接胜利保卫果实！”等口号。由于群众思想上都做了准备，一般号召又恰如其分的提出之后，立即就掀起群众性的强烈参军运动。积极分子、干部串通群众，群众串通群众，父亲串通儿子，妇女串通丈夫，相互串通着，各街青壮年们都是三五成群的集体报名自动参军，很少是个别动员的，所以在各街里仅仅只是两天的时间里就报名到五百七十四名，已经超过任务一倍多了。广大群众听到青壮年们报名参军，互相报着喜信，自动拥护新战士。如西关街小商人石优美已经五十三岁了，听到本街有二十个青壮年报名参军，到参军委员会里一看，大笑，跑到家里拿了两瓶白酒，三十个咸鸡子，送到参军委员会拥护新战士。经区里检验报名的新的战士后，各街都开欢送新战士会，新战士向群众讲话里很少提出家庭困难的，个个都表示着“不打败蒋军不回家”的坚决意志，新战士们的家属都在嘱咐他们的儿子、丈夫上前方好好打败蒋介石。妇女刘薛氏送郎上前线说：“你在前方好好打仗，坚定挖穷根；我在后方纺花织布栽富苗，栽了富苗还要支援前线。”欢送的群众们都是成几十人的上台讲话，诉着蒋贼给的苦，嘱咐新战士好好打卖国贼；提到优待军属，妇女们说：“以后凡是缝缝运运的事都是我们的。”儿童们说：“凡是跑跑打打的事都是我们的。”许多群众都是自己报着照顾某某军属。
    第三，新战士的审查工作。由于在进行参军号召时即强调“一定是自愿兵”，群众在讨论参军时也提出“不要斗争对象坏分子参军，他们拿上枪不会保卫咱们。”所以这次参军报名者绝大多数是好的，审查工作比较容易的进行了。经过群众和领导上的审查后，入伍青壮年中农民（大部是翻身的农民）占百分之三十三·五，各业工人（包括工厂工人、手工业工人、学徒、泥水匠、木匠等）占百分之廿·七，店员占百分之十二·四，贫苦市民与小商人占百分之三十二·七。从政治质量上看：其中共产党员占百分之十四·三，街干部占百分之八，民兵占百分之六十八。从这两个统计里可以看到质量是好的。
