　　US Reactionary Diplomacy Provokes Fierce Criticism From All Sides
　　The Moscow Conference of the Four Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States and France is scheduled to open on the 10th. Bevin, Bidault, and Marshall, as well as their respective delegations, have arrived in the Soviet capital. Given the breadth and profound impact of this four-power consultation, people around the world are paying close attention to it.

　　In the week leading up to this important meeting, the clamor of American expansionists has subsided somewhat. Leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties specifically called on members of Congress on the 6th to temporarily halt criticism of the Soviet Union during the Moscow Conference. However, at the same time, the US authorities made several diplomatic moves. One was the US State Department's announcement on the 6th protesting the Soviet-controlled authorities in Hungary for arresting Kóvács, the former Secretary-General of the Smallholders Party, a fascist. This incident occurred on the eve of Marshall's departure from the United States for the Soviet Union and is another example of American "pinprick diplomacy." The second was Marshall's statement on the 4th promising economic aid to Greece and requesting British troops to continue to be stationed there. The British government had requested assistance from the US some time ago, but the US only granted it on the eve of this Moscow Conference. This was clearly an attempt to give Britain a boost. The third was that Marshall changed his itinerary en route to the Soviet Union, making a special trip to Paris to visit the French President and Prime Minister. All three of these actions give the impression that the US is eager to respond at a time when the Anglo-French alliance was signed on the 4th, negotiations on revising the Anglo-Soviet treaty will begin as soon as Bevin arrives in the Soviet Union, and talk of an Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is rampant. They also show that the US will have some plans at the meeting. Of particular note is that when Marshall passed through Berlin, he emphasized that the US policy for dealing with the German question was the same as Byrnes' Stuttgart speech last year, and the principles discussed in that speech contradicted the Potsdam Conference resolutions. As a result, Bidault and some members of the British delegation said on their way to the Soviet Union that the Moscow Conference would have "great difficulties."

　　However, these actions by the US authorities have aroused opposition at home and abroad. US Senator Taylor and Representative Sadowski have successively demanded that the authorities abide by the Potsdam Agreement, strongly stating that "we must cooperate with the Soviet Union and defeat the disastrous policy of quarreling with the Soviet Union, which is supported by the Republican Party." Union leader Nixon further pointed out that if the US adopts the policies of Vandenberg and Dulles, it will be impossible to solve the problem of foreign trade. The Greek National Liberation Front and the Greek Communist Party have severely criticized the US for providing economic assistance to the reactionary government in Athens. The Soviet Union resolutely rejected the US protest regarding the Hungarian issue on the 8th.

　　As Moscow prepares to open, the world situation has taken on new developments. Regardless of the US attitude towards the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, Bevin and Bidault met with Molotov on the 9th before visiting Marshall. As Soviet international affairs expert Monin said on the 7th in commenting on the Moscow Conference, there are many difficulties in the German question, but if it is handled in good faith, a consensus can be reached. If an agreement is reached on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement, it will make it impossible for any conspiracy by American capitalists who want to turn Germany into a colony to succeed.

### 美国反动外交策动遭到各方严厉抨击

　　美国反动外交策动遭到各方严厉抨击
    苏英美法四强外长莫斯科会议定十日揭幕，贝文、比道尔以及马歇尔及各该国代表团均已抵达苏京。鉴于此次四强会商内容之广泛与乎影响之深远，全世界人民均予以重大之注意。
    在此重大会议之前的一周中，美国扩张主义分子的叫嚣已较前稍减，民主、共和两党领袖特于六日吁请国会人士在莫斯科会议期间对苏联之批评暂行停止。然而就在此同时，美国当局又作若干外交上的策动，其一为美国务院六日公布抗议苏联驻匈牙利控制当局逮捕法西斯分子的小地主党前总书记柯法克，此事发生于马歇尔离美赴苏之前夕，为美国“针刺外交”之又一例。其二为马歇尔四日声明允予希腊经济援助，并要求英军继续驻扎希境，本来英政府在若干时日以前，即要求美方予希援助，而美方直至在此莫斯科会议前夕始予允许，这显然是拉英国一把。其三为马歇尔于赴苏途中改变行程，特路经巴黎而访问法国总统及总理。凡此三端，一则使人有如是印象，即在此英法同盟已于四日签字、而英苏修约谈判俟贝文抵苏后即行开始、英法苏三国同盟之说又甚嚣尘上之际，美方急谋应付；一则显示美方在会上将有所策划，此中令人注意者，为马歇尔于路过柏林时，曾强调美方处理德国问题之方针为去岁贝纳斯的斯图加特演说，而此演说中所谈之原则，又适与波茨顿会议决议相违反。因之比道尔及英代表团若干人士在赴苏途中，曾言及莫斯科会议将有“甚大困难”。
    然而，美国当局这些行动已引起国内外之反对。美参议员泰勒、众议员沙多夫斯基等，已先后要求当局遵守波茨顿协定，力言“必须与苏联合作，并击败与苏联争吵的灾难政策即共和党所拥护的政策。职工领袖尼克松更指出，如美国采取范登堡、杜勒斯的政策，则不可能解决对外贸易问题。希腊民族解放阵线及希共严厉抨击美予雅典反动政府以经济援助。苏联已于八日坚决拒绝美方关于匈牙利问题之抗议。
    当此莫斯科筹备揭幕之际，世界局势已有新的发展，不管美国对苏英法态度如何，贝文及比道尔已于九日在访马歇尔之前，先后与莫洛托夫会谈。正如苏联国际问题专家莫宁七日评论莫斯科会议时所说的，德国问题有许多困难，但如以善意行事，则可达到一致协议。如果以波茨顿协定为基础而达到协议的话，就可以使得想把德国变成殖民地的美国资本家任何诡计无法可施。（新华社延安十日电）
