　　After the masses had fully "vented" their grievances and had no further opinions to offer, Wang Ting, Yang Shuangquan, and others immediately requested the removal of cadres like Lü Jinbao. At this point, we consciously discovered and cultivated Liu Guoliang from Beiyuan, who could see the cadres' merits, to speak up. He said, "Although there are blemishes on the cadres' faces, their skin is ultimately white, representing shortcomings within their merits. In the past, the Beiyuan chief only listed pocket money on the receipts, and I was detained by the authorities for just a casual remark. Now, we can point out the cadres' shortcomings, and they can correct them. That's much better. Furthermore, cadres attend many meetings, lose work time, and eat cold meals, but their contributions to the masses are indeed substantial. We might not even be as good as them if we were cadres ourselves." This statement diffused the anger demanding the removal of cadres, shifting it towards a more correct approach.

　　The cadre team first conducted a discussion on "What are the harms of not mobilizing the backward?" to break down the attitude of looking down on or even hating the backward. Then, all the opinions raised by the backward peasants were given to the cadres; Lü Jinbao alone received more than fifty suggestions. The cadres were somewhat panicked and distressed, feeling that "being a cadre means working hard for no reward," and some stubbornly refused to admit their mistakes. At this time, we studied with the cadres, saying, "Most of the masses' opinions are correct, and some are half-correct. We cannot fixate on what is incorrect and fail to accept what is correct." At the same time, we also proposed, "As long as you honestly wash your faces before the masses, the masses will definitely see the cadres' merits and guarantee that there will be no struggle sessions; whoever washes their face the cleanest will be given credit." In this way, the cadres dispelled their concerns and had the determination to wash their faces.

　　After conditions were ripe for both sides to resolve their "knots," a meeting was held on the third day. After the masses presented their opinions one by one, District Chief Li was the first to wash his face. I also made a self-criticism based on the opinions raised by the masses. The village cadres said, "Even the district chief is washing his face, how can we not wash ours?" which greatly encouraged their sincerity and courage to wash their faces. Lü Jinbao said, "I am the number one in terms of bad work style; I will never retaliate against anyone who offers criticism. Because my work style was not good, everyone was afraid to see me. Although I am still the same person today, my heart has changed." After accepting most of the opinions and explaining a small portion, Jinbao also said, "One of my feet was already on the edge of a cliff, and everyone pulled me back this time. Please pull me further away from the edge of the cliff." The masses felt that Jinbao's self-criticism was sincere and that he had truly turned around, and everyone was happy. At this point, the two "fears" turned into two "laughs," the relationship between cadres and the masses was more united than ever, and the backward also moved forward. Specific issues were resolved back in the village, and all backward peasants were mobilized to untie their knots.

　　Comrades Li and Liu summarized simply: "Cadres washing their faces is the key to improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, improving the relationship between cadres and the masses is the main key to mobilizing the backward, and large-scale collective training is the best method. The leadership style of district cadres must implement the mass line, which is to allow the masses to educate themselves and learn on their own to understand ideology. The leadership's responsibility lies in cultivating typical examples that are key to reversing thinking, so as not to be submerged. District cadres must first wash their faces in order to set an example for village cadres, don't think that there are no 'knots' between district cadres and village cadres and the masses; sometimes the bad work style of village cadres is learned from district cadres."

　　区干首先带头检讨启发村干鼓舞群众
    群众肚子“泻透”后，再无意见可提时，王廷、杨双全等马上要求撤换吕金保等干部。这时就有意识的发现与培养能看见干部功劳的北原刘国亮发言，他说：“干部脸上虽有黑，皮可总是白的，是功劳里面的缺点。过去北原保长清单上支有零花钱，我说了句闲话，就把我扣到衙门里。现在干部有缺点咱能提，他能改，这多好。再说干部开会多，误工多、吃冷饭，为群众功劳也实在不少。叫咱当干部还不见得如人家哩。”这一说，落下了撤换干部的怒气，变为正确的处理态度。
    干部队是首先进行“不发动落后有什么害处”的讨论，打破看不起甚至仇视落后的态度，接着把落后农民所提的意见全部都交给干部，只吕金保就接到五十多条意见。干部有些恐慌苦恼了，感到“当干部出力没下场”，有的硬着嘴不承认。这时，我们就和干部研究说：“群众的意见大部是对的，有些一半对。我们不能死盯住不对的，对的也不接受。”同时又提出：“只要老实向群众洗脸，群众定会看见干部功劳，保证不会斗；谁要洗得脸净，还给谁记功。”这样，干部打消了顾虑，有了洗脸的决心。
    双方解“圪瘩”条件成熟后，第三天即集合在一起开会。群众将意见一一提过后，李区长是第一个洗脸的人，我把群众所提意见作了检讨。村干部说：“区长还洗脸哩，咱们还能不洗，大大鼓舞了他们洗脸的诚心和勇气。”吕金保说：“我是作风不好的第一名，大家提意见我决不报复；我因作风不大好，人人见了害怕。今天虽还是我这块肉，可是我的心变了。”金保将大部意见接受和小部解释后，又说：“我一条脚已跌在崖下了，大家这次才把我拉起来，你们把我拉到离崖边再远些吧。”群众觉得金保检讨诚实，就是真转过来了，大家都高兴。至此，两个“怕”变成了两个“笑”，干群关系空前团结，落后也前进了。具体问题回村解决，并发动全部落后农民解圪瘩。
    李、刘二同志简单的总结：“干部洗脸是改善干群关系的关键，改善干群关系是发动落后的主要关键，而大批集训又是最好的方式。区干部领导作风要贯彻群众路线，就是让群众自教自学的自通思想。领导责任在培养扭转思想关键的典型，才不会自淹。区干部首先洗脸才能给村干部做榜样，不要以为区干部与村干部、群众就没“圪瘩”，有时村干部不良作风是跟着区干部学来的”。
