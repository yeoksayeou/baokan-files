    Qinghe Struggles Against Hidden Landlords
    [This newspaper's Jinan dispatch, 27th] In Qinghe's in-depth inspection movement, cunning landlords were exposed and struggled against. In the first district's Wu Song Village, when the gravely evil landlord Wu Zhenbang was struggled against last time, the Farmers' Association Director Wu Geduo was bought off, and the struggle was not thorough. This time, during the inspection, after deliberation, enlightenment, and education, with the leadership supporting the masses, the masses rose up and unanimously demanded a resolute and thorough reckoning with Wu Zhenbang. After the masses discussed his crimes and circumstances, they unanimously agreed to leave each member of his family two mu of land and a house, and return the rest entirely to the peasants. In the second district's Chen Er Village, the landlord Jiao Dong colluded with traitors and puppets. In last year's mass movement, because he provoked village cadres to be disunited and sectarianism arose in the village, the struggle against him was not thorough. During this major inspection, each group conducted democratic discussions and unanimously agreed to re-handle him. It was resolved to confiscate one of his residences and thirteen mu of land. In the third district's Chengguan Village, it was discovered that the landlord Qiu Zhigui had concealed thirty mu of black land, previously using the excuse of his sister's "private" land, distributing it to three poor peasant households. During last year's mass movement, these three poor peasant households were deceived by him. Now, after education and enlightenment, they voluntarily reported it. The masses unanimously agreed to recover these thirty mu of black land and conduct another reckoning with his family.
