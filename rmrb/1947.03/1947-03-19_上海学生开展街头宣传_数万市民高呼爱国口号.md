Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Shanghai News: The Shanghai Student Anti-Tyranny Federation decided to conduct anti-tyranny patriotic street propaganda on Sunday. On the afternoon of the 23rd of last month, the Federation set out according to plan. Participants included more than ten units such as St. John's University, Aurora University, Soochow University, and the China Industrial and Commercial School, totaling more than a thousand people. They were divided into ten large teams, which were further divided into hundreds of small teams. Each large team had a propaganda vehicle. When a large team arrived in a busy area, it split into small teams, carrying zithers, washbasins, gongs, and various musical instruments, and beat them everywhere. Citizens gathered upon hearing the sound. Propagandists told the truth about the "February 9th" bloody incident and the Chongqing "February 5th" and "February 8th" tragedies, and accused Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents of beating patriotic people. The listeners were all moved. When the propagandists sang ditties such as "Down with the Secret Agents," rickshaw pullers and pedicab drivers also sang along in unison. The propagandists mingled with the citizens. A middle-aged man in his forties insisted on participating in the propaganda and automatically distributed propaganda materials. A small vendor listened and said: "Your actions are right. Indeed, business has been bad since American goods came!" After listening, the citizens all said that they wanted to avenge Liang Renda and decided not to buy American goods next time. When the propagandists shouted patriotic slogans, the citizens responded in unison. On that day, tens of thousands of citizens listened to the speeches. At the Baxianqiao sub-station alone, more than two thousand citizens gathered, and 50,000 copies of the "Letter to Citizens" were distributed.
