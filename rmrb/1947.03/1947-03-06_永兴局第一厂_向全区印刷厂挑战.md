Yongxing Bureau First Factory
Challenges All Printing Factories in the Region

[Reported by this newspaper] The First Factory of Yongxing Printing Bureau, to implement and improve the results of the first support-the-frontline movement last year, put forward the slogan: "Increase production, improve quality, practice strict economy, and transform thinking," calling for the launch of the second "support movement." According to the plan of all factory workers, specific standards for increasing production and saving were formulated, and these conditions were used to challenge Military Industry Branch Factory No. 1, while also launching a challenge to all printing factories in the border region: (1) In terms of increasing production: guarantee the output of 1.1 million characters per month (compared to the past average of 950,000), and an average of one additional voluntary work day per month for each worker in the factory. Departments with more than 20 people should not have more than two people taking personal leave each month; cultivate four skilled apprentices in magazine page assembly and six in book page assembly; those who have just arrived this year should learn to classify all kinds of materials and typeset simple drafts during the movement; four apprentices capable of engraving topic characters and No. 5 characters; four apprentices familiar with all complete casting. Deadlines are tight, and only early completion is allowed. (2) Improve quality: pay attention to the aesthetics of page layout, eliminate blurred topic characters, pick out high and low characters, and ensure no more than ten errors per 70,000 characters. Technical workers should make at least two uses of each paper matrix. Seventy percent of apprentices who have been here for half a year should achieve two uses of each matrix, and lead typefaces should be clear to ensure exquisite printing. (3) In terms of economy: implement the existing economy system from last year's "support movement," set standards for material consumption, and implement a reward and penalty system. Stipulate the service life of supplies and ensure that old items are exchanged for new ones without losing a single lead character. (4) In terms of transforming thinking: one-third of the staff should participate in political classes, and at each critical juncture of the situation, all factory personnel (including cooks, etc.) should discuss current affairs in groups and establish a core group for current affairs. Organize a newspaper reading group for those who cannot understand the newspaper, learning one to five characters and one hour of cultural learning each day. Regularly publish "Employee Life" to conduct labor discipline education. (5) To ensure the completion of the above four points, implement individual registration, quality inspection and dismissal systems, conduct grouped production, and carry out merit-based competitions between individuals and groups. Organize technical research conferences based on production units, and workers should strive to be "model mother hens" (teaching good practices); apprentices should promote the spirit of hard work and self-study, and establish a democratically elected judging committee and workers' union to promote collective leadership. Conduct informal review meetings once a week or every half month, and a monthly factory-wide unity based on individual plan reviews. Each cadre should help at least one worker improve and pay attention to hygiene to prevent disease. Improve meals on the existing basis and eat more varieties. Activate the broadcasting station and commend models at any time.

    【本报讯】永兴印刷局第一厂，贯彻与提高去年第一次支援前线运动的成果，提出：“增加生产，提高质量，厉行节约，改造思想”，号召发动第二次“支运”。根据全厂职工计划，订出具体增产节约标准，并以此条件向军工一分厂应战，同时向全边区印刷厂发起挑战：（一）增产方面：每月保证排出一百一十万字（过去平均每月九十五万），全厂平均每人每月加一个义务工。二十人以上的部门每月不超过两个人请事假；要培养出四个熟练的拚杂志版、六个拚书版的练习生；今年刚来者，在运动期内学会归各式材料和排简单稿；四个能刻题目字和五号字的练习生；四个熟悉全部打浇的练习生。限期紧活，只准提前完成。（二）提高质量：版式讲究美观，消灭模糊题目字，拣出高低字，每七万字不超过十个错字，技术工人打的纸型起码一张用二次。半年前来的练习生十分之七作到一用二，铅版字划清楚，以便保证印刷精美。（三）节约方面：贯彻去年“支运”中已有的节约制度，材料订定耗用标准，实行分红分黑制。用品规定使用期，并作到以旧换新不掉一个铅字。（四）改造思想方面：三分之一的参加政治课，在每次时局转变关头，全厂人员（包括炊事员等）分组讨论时事，成立时事骨干小组。看不懂报的人组织一个读报组，每天识一至五个字与一小时文化学习。定期出版《职工生活》，进行劳动纪律教育。（五）保证上列四点完成，实行个人登记，质量检查与退工制，进行分组生产，人与人、组与组进行立功竞赛。根据生产单位组织技术研究会，工人争取做“模范老母鸡”（教人好的）；练习生发扬苦学自学精神，成立民选评判会、工人会，发扬集体领导。分别进行一周或半月一次的漫谈式检讨会，一月一次从检查个人计划作为基础的全厂团结。每个干部起码要帮助一个工友进步，并注意卫生，防止疾病。在现有基础上改善伙食，多吃花样。活跃广播台，随时表扬模范。
