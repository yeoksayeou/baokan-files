　　Implementing Labor-Capital Profit Sharing to Increase Production
    Yihua Iron Factory Achieves Significant Business Development
    [Report from our Jinan Bureau on the 1st] Responding to the call of the democratic government to improve workers' lives, increase production, and improve quality, the Yihua Iron Factory in Linqing City has experienced rapid business development, with both labor and capital reaping substantial profits. The factory, which started operations in January of last year with a capital of 1.66 million yuan, manufactured cotton gin bows and wide-bottomed pots. At the end of the lunar year, sales totaled over 36 million yuan. After deducting food, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses of over 8.29 million yuan (government burden accounting for only 7%), workers' wages of over 2.66 million yuan, the net profit was over 9.29 million yuan. The factory still had over 80,000 catties of coal, over 6,500 catties of pig iron, and over 8,000 catties of wood. The number of workers increased from 40 to over 50. The factory's rapid development is primarily attributable to two factors: First, it implemented wage and clothing increases for workers, improved their treatment, and adopted a profit-sharing system of 60% for capital and 40% for labor. Moreover, wages were adjusted according to price fluctuations, ensuring workers' family livelihoods and boosting their production enthusiasm. Shopkeeper Song Haizeng said: "Since improving workers' treatment, production volume and quality have rapidly increased, expanding sales." Second, it implemented a business strategy of serving the rural areas. Shopkeeper Song joyfully told the reporter: "I deeply feel that running industries that serve the people's needs is most beneficial and glorious. Soon after our factory opened, we felt that the products couldn't meet the demand. We gained a valuable experience from our operations: to make money, it's best to manufacture all the tools ourselves." Last spring, they manufactured 18 pot-pouring molds, more than 10 large sandboxes for casting machines, and one machine bed for making machine parts. In the future, they plan to manufacture most of the tools they use themselves in order to obtain greater profits and expand the scale of the factory. Currently, the factory is preparing to produce iron weaving machines and cotton ginning machines (Note: there are now ten iron factories in Linqing City).

　　实行劳资分红提高产量
    益华铁厂营业大发展
    【本报冀南一日电】由于响应了民主政府改善工人生活、增加产量、提高质量的号召，临清市益华铁工厂，营业飞跃发展，劳资双方均获巨利。该厂自去年一月开办，资本为一百六十六万元，制造弹花弓和广锅，旧历年底结账时，销货共值三千六百余万元，除开支伙食、运费、公杂费、负担八百二十九万余元（交政府负担仅占百分之七），工人工资二百六十六万余元，净赚九百二十九万余元，尚存煤八万多斤、生铁六千五百多斤、木料八千多斤，工人由四十人增至五十多人。该厂能够获得如此迅速之发展，第一是对工人实行了增资增衣，改善了工人待遇，实行了资六劳四的分红制，而且工资随着物价之涨落而增减，工人家庭生活获得保障。生产情绪高涨。宋海增掌柜说：自提高工人待遇后，产量质量迅速提高，扩大了销路。第二是由于实现了为农村服务的营业方针。宋掌柜喜悦的告诉记者：我亲切感到办人民所需的工业最有利，也最光荣，我们工厂开办后，不久即感到产品供不应求，从经营中获得一个宝贵经验，就是要想赚钱，一切工具最好都来自己制造。去年春天他们自制了十八个倒锅模型，十余付倒机器的大沙箱，一付制机器零件的机器床。今后他们准备所用的工具，尽量自己制造，以便获得更大利润，并扩大工厂的规模。现该厂正准备出产铁制织布机、轧花车（按：现临市铁工厂已发展到十家）。
