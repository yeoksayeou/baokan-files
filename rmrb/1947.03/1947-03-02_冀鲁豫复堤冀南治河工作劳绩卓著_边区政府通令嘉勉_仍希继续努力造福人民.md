　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government recently issued the Bian Jian Lian Zi No. 1 circular, commending the dike restoration work on the Yellow River in the Ji-Lu-Yu area. The original text is as follows: To the Directors of Administrative Offices, Commissioners, and County Heads:

　　The return of the Yellow River to its old course has been a major struggle for our border region against the Kuomintang's conspiracy to flood our liberated areas for the past year, with the Ji-Lu-Yu area bearing the brunt. Despite the extreme shortage of labor and materials, and amidst enemy-caused disasters, Chiang-caused disasters, and natural disasters, with the masses lacking food and shelter, we mobilized and organized over 200,000 people daily to restore 1,462 *li* of dikes in just over ten days. The Kuomintang violated the agreement and released water without authorization. Our people along the river recognized the reactionary rulers' vicious conspiracy to harm the people, and unanimously rose up to save themselves, engaging in arduous and inspiring struggles. The correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the tireless efforts of Comrades Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu of the CCP delegation in Nanjing, Shanghai, Kaifeng, and other places, arguing on principle and speaking out for the people, are something that the people of this region should deeply appreciate. The administrative office planned effectively, and Comrades Wang Xiaoyi, Zhao Mingfu, Cheng Run, and Wang Huayun traveled to various places, mediating and negotiating, adhering to the principle of restoring dikes before releasing water, and resolutely opposing the conspiracy to flood and submerge us; and Commissioners and County Heads such as Zhang Fang, Lü Qian, Xie Xinhe, and Yang Jun, who directly led the masses along the river to restore dikes, as well as all cadres who participated in the dike restoration work, worked tirelessly day and night to organize and serve the people, achieving outstanding results.

　　This historically rare great engineering achievement, in addition to thanking the leadership and assistance of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the CCP delegation, is inseparable from the hard work and meritorious deeds of the people along the river and the above-mentioned leading cadres of the administrative office. The Third Plenary Session of our government's committee unanimously decided to extend cordial greetings to the compatriots along the river, to issue an explicit commendation to the administrative office and the above-mentioned cadres at all levels, and to issue a circular to the entire region to commend them. At present, the dike restoration has not been fully completed, and Chiang Kai-shek has already released water in violation of the agreement, causing the residents along the river to flee in panic, which is deeply regrettable and infuriating! How to argue on principle, strive for just assistance, and how to urgently save ourselves and stop the floods from flowing freely still requires our common and continued efforts. With the people of the border region as support and the people of the entire liberated area as a backing, the desperate struggle of the Ji-Lu-Yu area is not isolated, and we will surely shatter any conspiracy of the reactionaries to eliminate the liberated areas. This order!

　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government recently issued the Bian Min Jian Lian Zi No. 2 circular, commending the river harnessing work in Southern Hebei. The original text is as follows: To the Directors of Administrative Offices, Commissioners, and County Heads:

　　The river harnessing in Southern Hebei is a great construction work in our region. In one year, we dug four new rivers and ten old rivers, totaling 101,606 *zhang*; built 1,255,072 *zhang* of dikes; constructed nineteen canals, totaling 146,250 *zhang*; dredged twenty sections of straight ditches, dealt with thirty dangerous spots, repaired twelve sluice gates, repaired twenty-two bridges, and sealed sixty-four breaches.

　　The area of inundated land in the two river systems has been reduced from an average of 670,235 *mu* per year to 190,446 *mu*, saving 4,797,841 *mu* of cultivated land from flooding. This is a great creation of the people of Southern Hebei and should be commended; it is also an outstanding achievement of the administrative office and our cadres at all levels in serving the people and should be commended.

　　Comrade Liu Jixing, Director of the Construction Department of the Administrative Office, Comrade Zhang Jingbo, Director of the Fuyang River Affairs Bureau, Comrade Liu Zhouguang, Director of the Weiyun River Affairs Bureau, and the commissioners and county heads along the river, and the cadres at all levels who participated in the river harnessing work, have worked extremely hard and achieved remarkable results in serving the people. The Third Plenary Session of our government's committee unanimously decided to issue an explicit commendation. The administrative office's leadership is strong, and the entire region is hereby commended by circular, and we hope that they will continue to work hard to implement this year's river harnessing plan. This order!

　　Chairman Yang Xiufeng
　　Vice Chairman Rong Wusheng

    边区政府通令嘉勉
    仍希继续努力造福人民
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府顷发表边建联字第一号通令嘉勉冀鲁豫黄河复堤工作。原文如下：各行署主任、专员、县长：
    黄河归故是我边区一年来对国民党阴谋淹我解放区的重大斗争，冀鲁豫区首当其冲。在工料奇缺敌灾、蒋灾、天灾之余，群众食居无依的情况下，动员组织群众每天以二十余万计，在短短十几天内复堤一四六二里。国民党违反协议擅自放水，我沿河人民认清了反动统治者残民以逞的恶毒阴谋，一致奋起自救，艰苦斗争可歌可泣。中共中央的正确领导与中共代表团周恩来、董必武二先生等在南京、上海、开封等地的竭尽心力，据理力争，为民请命，这是本区人民应该深为感谢者。该署策划有方，该区王笑一、赵明甫、成润、王化云等同志的各地奔走，折冲撙俎，坚持先复堤后放水的原则，坚决反对放水淹我的阴谋；以及沿河直接领导群众复堤之张方、吕谦、谢鑫鹤、杨钧等专员、县长与所有参加复堤工作干部之日夜辛勤劳苦组织为人民服务，成绩优异。
    这一历史上少有的伟大工程成就，除应感谢中共中央及中共代表团的领导帮助外，与沿河人民及该署领导上述干部同志的辛劳功绩是分不开的，本府第三届全体委员会议一致决议，对沿河同胞致亲切之慰问，对该署及上述各级干部明令嘉奖，并通令全区予以表扬。现在复堤尚未全部完成，蒋介石已经违约放水，致使沿河居民仓惶流离，深可痛愤！当前如何据理抗争，争取正义援助，如何急起自救，制止洪水横流，仍须共同继续努力。有边区人民为支援，有全解放区人民为后盾，冀鲁豫区之殊死斗争不是孤立的，我们必能粉碎反动派消灭解放区之任何阴谋。此令！
