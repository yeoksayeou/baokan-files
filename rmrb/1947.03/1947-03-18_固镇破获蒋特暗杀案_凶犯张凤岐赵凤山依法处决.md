　　Gu Town Cracks Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Assassination Case
    Criminals Zhang Fengqi and Zhao Fengshan Executed According to Law
    [Our newspaper’s Wu'an dispatch] In the Ninth District of Gu Town, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents Zhang Fengqi and Zhao Fengshan, under the instigation of special agent leader Liu Zhicheng, specialized in spreading rumors and lies, undermining the peasants' emancipation, provoking discord between the military and the people, and even assassinating military personnel and government cadres. They were publicly tried by the masses and sentenced to death. Zhao Fengshan once used a technique of pressing on the shins with both hands to make one of our squad leaders dizzy, and then offered him a bowl of poisoned water. Fortunately, the squad leader did not drink it, thus avoiding disaster. Zhang Fengqi had poisoned the water tank in the garrison's kitchen and put red alum in the grain. On the morning of January 3rd, the troops went to eat, leaving only soldier Li Chunmao at home brushing his teeth. Zhang Fengqi put poison in his toothbrush cup, and Li Chunmao died an hour later. On January 20th, Zhao Fengshan poisoned Comrade Jing Guangqiu, the telephone platoon leader of a certain unit. On February 16th, he poisoned the water tank of village cadre Zhao Jitai, causing the whole family to fall ill for more than ten days. On February 20th, when the military and civilians went to a fair, cook squad leader Wang Zhanfu was alone at home. Special agent henchman Pan Mancang reported this to Zhang Fengqi and Zhao Fengshan. Zhang Fengqi, who was skilled in martial arts and very strong, strangled Comrade Wang Zhanfu to death in broad daylight and hung the corpse on a beam, pretending that Wang Zhanfu had committed suicide. In addition, they cut telephone wires five or six times and, disguised as dogs, crawled into cadres' rooms at night in an attempt to assassinate them, but failed. They also eavesdropped on telephone calls, stole documents, and smashed the troops' pigs, among other things. The Party and the people hated them to the core. Finally, on February 25th, the criminals Zhang Fengqi and Zhao Fengshan, along with their henchman Pan Mancang, were captured. On the 6th of this month, a public trial was held. The criminals confessed their crimes. With the unanimous demand of more than 2,000 people present, except for Chiang Kai-shek's special agent henchman Pan Mancang, who was given an opportunity to reform himself and sentenced to imprisonment because he was deceived and tricked, Zhang Fengqi and Zhao Fengshan were shot on the spot.
