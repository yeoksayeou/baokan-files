Checking Fields and Promoting Production Simultaneously
    Licheng, Pingxiang, and Other Places Create Methods
    [Our newspaper, Taihang News] Some villages in Licheng, Huguan, and other counties have achieved great success in conducting production during the rent reduction campaign. Dongguanbi Village in Huguan, under the leadership of the emancipated hero Huangfu Lai, engages in production during the day and struggle at night, holding a full-day meeting when necessary, achieving "no delay in checking fields and production." From mid-November of last year to January 20th of this year, the village's mill produced 115,000 yuan worth of goods. The oil mill produced 110,000 yuan, transportation earned 120,000 yuan, and textiles earned 65,000 yuan. Including the tofu workshops, flour mills, dye shops, cooperatives, etc., the total profit for more than two months was 786,000 yuan. In Licheng's Xiazhuang, textile work was not interrupted during the winter's rent reduction campaign. In three months, they wove 7,150 feet of cloth and spun 653 jin of thread, earning 1,117,000 yuan. Under the influence of labor hero Wang Fengqi's small cooperative, they organized oil mills, mills, saltpeter workshops, flour mills, tofu workshops, and transportation teams. These small cooperatives were closely integrated with the rent reduction campaign, earning a total profit of 2,567,000 yuan in three months. In Heshun's Shuangyujian Village, 52 women were organized for textile production during the rent reduction movement. In 40 days, they spun 253 jin of cotton, earning 157,000 yuan.

    [Our newspaper, Jinan, 28th dispatch] Pingxiang pays attention to close integration with production during rent reduction. Many villages are producing while fighting for emancipation. For example, the masses in Houjie, Makang Temple in the Fourth District, are almost all engaged in basket weaving. There are three dugout houses where baskets are woven, and people are engaged in production all day long. Cadres go down to the households separately, approach the masses, and inspire connections. Wang Mengjing said, "My family has cultivated land for two generations and worked hard all their lives, but for three generations, we haven't even had a proper gate. We still live in a 'jiudidun' (meaning a mud house without a foundation) with a thatched roof, suffering because of the landlord's exploitation." Many peasants have become aware and joined the peasant association to completely defeat the landlords. Cadres, fearing that it would delay the masses' production, decided to hold more group activities and fewer large meetings. In Aicun, in the Second District, men are salting the land and women are spinning and weaving during the day. The leadership decided that women should hold group meetings during the day, always taking some piecework with them, and men should hold group meetings in the evening. The masses' response has been very positive.

　　查田生产两不误
    黎城平乡等地创造办法
    【本报太行讯】黎城、壶关等县有些村庄，查减中进行生产，获得巨大成绩。壶关东关璧村在翻身英雄皇甫来掌领导下，白天生产夜晚斗争，必要时开一天大会，做到“查田生产两不误”。该村从去年十一月中旬到今年一月二十日，磨坊生产十一万五千元。油坊十一万元，运输十二万元，纺织六万五千元，算上豆腐坊、粉坊、染坊、合作社等，两个多月共获利七十八万六千元。黎城霞庄在去冬查减中，纺织工作也未间断，三个月织布七千一百五十尺，纺线六百五十三斤，赚洋一百一十一万七千元。在劳动英雄王逢奇小型合作社影响下，组织了油坊、磨坊、硝坊、粉坊、豆腐坊、运输组等。这些小型合作与查减紧密结合，三个月共获利二百五十六万七千元。和顺双鱼间村查减运动中组织了五十二个妇女纺织，四十天纺花二百五十三斤，赚钱十五万七千元。（史廷璧、辰星）
    【本报冀南二十八日电】平乡查减中，注意和生产密切结合，不少村作到一面生产，一面闹翻身、如四区马康庙后街群众，差不多都编锅拍，有三个编锅拍子的地窨子，人们整日都在专边生产，干部就分头下户子，接近群众，启发串连。王梦景说：“俺家两辈子捎地，一辈子抗活，三辈没有个街门，现在还是住着“就地墩”（土房没墙脚的意思）麦秸顶的破房受罪，这都是地主剥削的。”不少农民觉悟，参加农会，彻底打垮地主。干部怕耽误群众生产，又决定多在小组活动，少开大会。二区艾村，白天男的淋盐，妇女纺花织布，领导上研究决定，白天妇女开小组会，都必须拿着零活，晚上男的开小组会，群众反映很是满意。
