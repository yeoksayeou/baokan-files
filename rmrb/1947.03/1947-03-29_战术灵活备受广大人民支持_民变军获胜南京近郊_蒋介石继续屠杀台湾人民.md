    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th – According to sources from Southern Jiangsu: The people's uprising forces are extremely active in the vicinity of Nanjing. On a certain day in late February, a unit of the people's uprising forces engaged in a fierce battle with Chiang's "encirclement and suppression" troops near Qian'ai Temple, more than 20 li north of Danyang, for as long as ten hours. The Kuomintang Nanjing city defense forces also went to assist in the battle, but ultimately the people's uprising forces won a complete victory due to their flexible tactics and skills, killing and capturing dozens of Chiang's army platoon leaders and below, and seizing one light machine gun, three Mauser pistols, and eleven rifles. This unit is deeply rooted among the people and receives widespread support and endorsement.
