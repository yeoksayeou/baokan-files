    The Political Tendencies of Shanghai People
    Pu Jun
    To analyze the political leanings of Shanghai citizens today, it's generally said they are more left-leaning. Attitudes toward the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) can be divided into the following categories:
    The first type, especially workers, as well as progressive students, businessmen, cultural figures, and freelance professionals, recognize the greatness of the CCP from legends, their own hometowns, books, newspapers, and historical experience. They also personally experience the bloody and dark rule of the KMT. The contrast between the two intensifies their support for the CCP. The Shanghai "Masses Weekly" (a CCP organ, now ordered to be closed down by the Jiang government), whose sales topped the magazine industry, is proof of this. The number of these people is "increasing daily, and from the perspective of the proportion of the city's people, it is a relatively large number."
    The second type are neutral individuals, mostly from the upper-middle class. They used to have some prejudices against the CCP (influenced by KMT propaganda), but these have long been shaken. Many people in Shanghai are like this. They express: "We cannot make any assertions about the CCP. We will talk about it after seeing the facts in the future." However, when the topic touches on the KMT, they immediately say, based on practical experience: "That! No need to say anything, they are simply a gang of foxes and dogs, even worse than the pro-Japanese traitors!"
    The third type is a smaller minority. Because they have been deceived by the rulers throughout history, they are pessimistic and disappointed, thinking: "All crows under the sky are equally black!" Furthermore, because they have been subjected to deceptive propaganda from the KMT, they believe that the CCP is also no good. However, they believe that the KMT is "so bad that it cannot get any worse." After seeing many facts, these people can easily discover that their own understanding is flawed.
    Only a very small number of reactionaries and special agent lackeys are resolutely anti-communist and anti-people.
    It can be said that attitudes towards the CCP have various different expressions, but the understanding and attitude towards the KMT is consistent: "So bad that it cannot get any worse!"
    Because the Democratic League can unite with the people to strive for democracy and peace, even though it only met the people of Shanghai after the war, its status and prestige have greatly improved.
    In a word: The prestige of the KMT's Jiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families is inversely proportional to their wealth. On the one hand, they are "making ten thousand gold a day," while on the other hand, they are "plummeting rapidly."

    上海人的政治倾向
    蒲军
    要分析今天上海市民的政治倾向，一般的说是更左了。对中共和国民党的态度，可分下列几类：
    第一种人，特别是工人，以及进步的学、商、文化人、自由职业者，他们从传说，从自己的故乡，从书本上，从报章上以及从历史上的经验，认识到中共的伟大，更身受国民党血腥的黑暗统治，两相对比与对中共的拥戴更热烈了。上海的《群众周刊》（中共机关刊物，现已为蒋政府勒令停刊）销数占杂志界的首席，即为一证明，这种人“天天的激增着，而且从全市人民的比例来看，是一个较大的数字。
    第二种人是中立人士，多半为中上阶层，他们对于中共过去有些成见（受国民党宣传影响），但自下早已动摇。这样的人在上海很不少，他们的表示是：“咱对中共不能作任何断言，待将来看到事实后再谈。”然而谈锋一刺到国民党，他们就根据实际经验，立刻会说：“那！不用说了，简直是狐群狗党，经汉奸还不如！”
    第三种人是较少数的，他们由于历来受统治者的欺骗，所以悲观失望，以为：“天下乌鸦一般黑！”更因受到国民党的欺骗宣传，认为中共也不行，但是对于国民党则认为“坏的无可再坏”，这些人在看到许多事实后，就很容易去发觉了自己认识上的半斤八两是错误的。
    只有极少极少的反动分子，特务狗腿，才是坚决反共反人民的。
    可以说对中共的态度总有各种不同的表示，而对国民党的认识和态度，则是一致的：“坏到不可再坏！”
    民主同盟也因其能与人民一致争取民主和平，所以虽然战后才与上海人相见，其地位与威信已大大提高了。
    一句话：国民党蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族的威信，正与他的财产成反比例，一方面是“日进万金”，一方面却是“一落千丈”。
