　　Turning-Over Hero Bai Gui Personally Takes the Lead
    Patiently Mobilizing Village Cadres to Return Fruits
    [This newspaper, Cixian News] In the third district, Shangchen Village, turning-over hero Bai Gui guided cadres to voluntarily return the fruits they had gained excessively and examine their work style, greatly enhancing the unity between cadres and the masses. During the in-depth movement in the village, cadres proposed to the masses, "Whoever is protecting the landlord's belongings should quickly hand them over to wash their faces clean," but the masses reflected, "If the masses holding the landlord's belongings is black, is it not black for the cadres to embezzle the fruits?" After discovering this situation, turning-over hero Bai Gui immediately convened a cadre meeting for self-criticism. He took the lead in confessing and handing over a felt blanket, a quilt, and a stool that he had obtained without the consent of the masses. Influenced by him, the Director of People's Education, Liu Xingran, handed over a chair; the Public Security Officer, Bai Liang, confessed to a felt blanket and a mattress; and Bao Ping confessed that he and Bao Xuewen and four others had stolen half a vat of clothes during the struggle against bullies in the winter of the previous year. But then they discovered that some cadres had the idea of being afraid of losing face. Bai Gui guided everyone in carefully discussing, "Have we lost our people? How can we not lose face?" They unanimously recognized that confessing frankly and returning the items was not a loss of face, and they were all willing to return all the items to the masses. The next day, the cadres took out the embezzled items and placed them in front of the theater. The masses were surprised and said, "What are they doing!" Later, a mass meeting was held. The cadres made self-criticisms one by one, admitted their mistakes, and allowed the masses to judge. The masses said, "The cadres have made great contributions to us. Who doesn't make small mistakes? A good cadre is one who can correct their mistakes." Some said, "If the cadres are giving in to us, we must also give in to the cadres." After everyone's discussion, they supported giving the cadres the things that were useful to them. The Director of People's Education, Liu Xingran, did not have a chair, and the masses still carried the chair back to his house. Liu Xingran repeatedly declined, but the masses said, "You have to take it whether you want it or not!" As for Bao Xuewen, who had embezzled the most fruits and did not confess thoroughly, the masses unanimously decided to replace him, calling on him to reflect well. Bao Liang wasted the embezzled items and cannot return them now. The masses said, "We won't ask him to return them now, but will ask him to make contributions in the future, and offset his mistakes with future merits." After the meeting, the masses reflected, "In the past, which puppet township head didn't embezzle? Who dared to say anything! Now, if it weren't for the cadres led by the Communist Party, who could be like this!" Now the cadres and masses in the village are unprecedentedly united and are continuing to carry out the tail-cutting movement.

　　翻身英雄白贵亲自带头
    耐心动员村干退果实
    【本报磁县讯】三区上陈村翻身英雄白贵引导干部自退多得果实，检讨作风，大大增强干群团结。该村深入运动中，干部向群众提出“谁保护地主东西赶快献出来，洗脸擦黑”，但群众反映：“群众保有地主东西是黑，干部贪污果实是黑不是黑？”翻身英雄白贵发现这种情况后，立即召集干部会进行检讨，他带头讲出并交出自己未经群众同意而得的一领毡子、一条被子、一个板凳。在他影响下，民教主任刘兴然交出一个椅子；公安员白亮检讨出一领毡子，一个铺底；暴平将前年冬天斗争暴平时和暴学文等四人偷的半缸衣服也坦白出来。但又发现有些干部有怕丢人思想，白贵引导大家仔细讨论：“咱们的人丢了没有？怎样才算不丢人？”一致认识坦白认错退出并不丢人，都愿将东西全部退还群众。第二天干部把贪污的东西拿出摆在戏楼前，群众惊奇地说：“这是干啥哩！”以后召开群众大会，干部一个个自我检讨，承认错误，并让群众裁判时，群众说：“干部对咱有很大功劳，人谁还没个小错，有错能改就是好干部。”有的说：“干部尽让咱，咱也得尽让干部。”经过大家讨论，把干部有用的东西拥护给干部，民教主任刘兴然没有椅子，群众把椅子仍旧抬回他家，刘兴然再三推让不要，群众说：“不要也得要！”对贪污果实最多、坦白不彻底的暴学文，群众一致决定撤换他，叫他好好反省、暴良将贪污的东西浪费了，现在退不出，群众说：“现在不叫他还，叫他今后立功，将来将功折罪。”会后群众反映：“以前伪乡长那个不贪污，谁敢吭！如今要不是共产党领导的干部，谁能像这样呢！”现在该村干部与群众空前团结，正继续展开割尾巴运动。
