【Report from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 12th】The phenomenon of cadres and activists in some villages in Tunliu County obtaining excessive "fruit" (the gains of land reform) is quite serious. In Wangjiazhuang, Second District, out of a total of 97 households, 86 households had obtained "fruit," with the entire village possessing 458 mu of land, 125 rooms, and 410 shi of rice as a result of land reform. The 12 cadre-activist households in the village alone obtained 204 mu of land, 64 rooms, and 240 shi of rice, accounting for about one-half of the total "fruit." The methods for obtaining excessive "fruit" were mostly exclusive occupation, cheap purchases, and private appropriation. This phenomenon has attracted great attention from the leadership. County and district leaders personally visited households, conducted detailed inspections, and specifically promoted the slogan "Liberate oneself, help others liberate themselves, and achieve liberation for everyone." Many activists have already voluntarily returned excess "fruit." For example, Xi Yuangong, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Lingshang Village, voluntarily gave up 30 shi of millet; Liu Quanlin, director of the Military Committee, gave up a courtyard of houses and a head of livestock; and village cadre Liu Quansheng voluntarily gave up half of his livestock to help everyone achieve liberation.

　　屯留县区干部亲自动员
    认真解决退果实问题
    【本报太岳十二日电】屯留某些村庄干部与积极分子多得果实现象相当严重。二区王家庄共九十七户，得果实户八十六户，全村总果实地四百五十八亩，房一百二十五间，米四百一十石。该村干部积极分子十二户，就得地二百○四亩，房六十四间，米二百四十石，业占总果实约二分之一。多得果实的方法：多为独占、贱买和私取。这种现象已引起领导上极大注意。县区领导干部亲自挨户访问，详细检查，具体推动在“自己翻身、帮助别人翻身，做到人人翻身”口号下，已有不少积极分子自动让出果实。如岭上村农会主席袭元公，自愿匀出小米三十石，武委会主任刘全林匀去房子一院、牲口一头，村干部刘全盛自愿匀出牲口二分之一，帮助大家翻身。
