    [This dispatch from our newspaper’s correspondent in Taihang on the 28th] After four months of comprehensive guerrilla warfare in Anyang, new developments have been made in the creation of guerrilla warfare experience. The turning point began in November of last year, when, after reviewing the previous stage of the struggle, it was clearly proposed to carry out independent and autonomous mass-based guerrilla warfare, and to promote the positive aspects of cadres and the masses: "The people of Anyang have hard bones, and they will fight the enemy to the death. We would rather be beaten down than dragged down." It also called on good cadres to take the lead in serving the people and establishing meritorious service, and to organize a large number of armed work teams, fighting on one hand and rectifying on the other, marching into the enemy's rear. Since then, the entire situation has been reversed, from passive to active. Before January, the activities of the armed work teams averaged eight times a day, and later increased to twelve times. On average, they killed or wounded more than seven enemies a day, killing or wounding nearly eight hundred enemies in four months. During the struggle, twenty-nine enemy-killing heroes emerged, more than sixty villages were recovered, and three enemy rear base areas were initially created. The area of activity expanded to 186 villages, and the entire springboard area moved forward one step. The main experiences gained from these achievements are: (1) Rapidly support the united struggle against the enemy in the enemy's rear with new guerrilla warfare. After the armed work teams went deep into the enemy's rear and launched struggles, in order to directly connect the frontal struggle with the enemy's rear war, the original single-line joint defense organization in this area was changed. District boundaries were broken up, and a deep joint defense was established from front to back. The district organizations established joint command headquarters. Each joint defense responsibility area was in the enemy's rear, all facing east of the Pinghan Railway, overcoming the initial fragmented and chaotic state. Everyone shifted from cooperating with each other to actively fighting together to win the victory of the vanguard. The frontal enemy's rear armed work teams, militia, and demolition teams coordinated their actions in a unified manner. In the frontal border areas, they transformed the necessary terrain, destroyed roads, etc., to stop the enemy's expansion. In the enemy's rear, they greatly developed all aspects of guerrilla warfare, so that the front and rear combined military and political activities. The district joint defense organization leadership absorbed armed work teams, mass leaders, and enemy-killing heroes, which facilitated unified command, and the strength was easy to concentrate and disperse. The enemy not only could not destroy us, but was constantly subjected to our serious blows. (2) Highly develop the new creations of mass guerrilla tactics to form a multi-faceted guerrilla struggle. Since the call to universally launch the blasting movement, from December 9th to 23rd, in the Second District area, more than thirty enemies were blown up one after another, and examples of killing and wounding enemies through the combination of flying explosions, capture, and sniping appeared in the enemy's rear. Based on the creations of the masses, the leadership put forward the call for four major tactics: In the enemy's rear, carry out flying explosions, sniping, capture, and night raids. Flying captures, climbing walls, and jumping off cliffs should be sudden and accurate, and should combine courage and wisdom with flexibility. Flying explosions should fly far and lay many mines. The burying method should be clever. Immediately, a killing and anti-reckoning meritorious service competition was launched on the front of the enemy's rear. Under the organized "starry sky" flying activities, the four main aspects of explosions, sniping, capture, and night raids formed a guerrilla fire network in the enemy's rear. Flying capture and sniping are combined with landmine attacks to block the enemy. The combination of offense and defense, and flexible dispersal and concentration, has also developed into using guerrillas against "guerrillas," putting the enemy's puppet special forces in a state of constant killing and terror. (3) The combination of guerrilla armed forces with various aspects of the struggle can establish guerrilla base areas. The people's strength can be rapidly developed further, and more people will take up arms against the enemy.

    安阳游击战获胜经验：
    打乱区界建立纵深联防
    四大战术结合构成游击火网
    【本报太行二十八日电】安阳经过四个月全面游击战争的开展，在游击战争经验的创造上有着进一步的新发展。形势的开始转变是在去年十一月，当时从检讨前一段的斗争中，明确提出要进行独立自主的群众性游击战争，发扬干部与群众的积极面：“安阳人骨头硬，死也要与敌人拚，宁叫打垮，不叫拖垮。”并号召好干部要带头为民立功，大量组织武工队，一面斗争，一面整顿，向敌后进军。从此，扭转了整个形势，由被动走向主动。元月前，武工队的活动每天平均八次，以后到十二次，每天平均要杀伤敌人七个以上，四个月杀伤敌近八百左右，斗争中涌现出二十九名杀敌英雄，收复村子六十多个，初创了三块敌后根据地，活动村扩大到一百八十六个，整个跳板区向前推进了一步。获得这些成绩的主要经验是：（一）迅速以新的游击战争支持敌后统一对敌斗争。当武工队深入敌后斗争展开之后，为使正面斗争与敌后战争直接连结起来，便一改过去的本区单线联防组织，打乱区界，由前而后的建立了纵深联防。区组织联合指挥部，每个联防的责任区在敌后，一致面向平汉路东，克服了初期的一片片、一团团的支离混乱状态，使大家由各自配合转向了共同积极的为争取最前锋胜利而战斗。正面敌后武工队、民兵、爆炸组统一配合行动，在正面边地改造必要地形、破路等，以停止敌人伸展。在敌后则大大发展各方面的游击斗争，以使前后同作到军事政治活动相结合。区联防组织领导吸收武工队和群众领袖及杀敌英雄等组成，便于统一指挥，力量也易集中和分散，敌对我不但摧不垮，反而时时遭到我严重的打击。（二）高度发挥群众游击战术上的新创造，形成多面的游击斗争。自号召普遍开展爆炸运动后，从十二月九号到二十三号，在二区一带，就先后炸伤敌三十多个，并在敌后出现了飞行爆炸、捕捉和冷枪相互结合杀伤敌人的范例。领导上根据群众创造，提出四大战术号召：敌后要进行飞行爆炸、冷枪、捕捉和夜摸。飞行捕捉爬墙跳崖要突然、准确，要勇智结合机动灵活，飞行爆炸要远飞，下雷多。埋法巧。随即在敌后正面开展杀敌和反倒算立功竞赛。在有组织的“满天星”飞行活动下、从爆炸、冷枪、捕捉、夜摸四个主要方面构成了敌后游击火网。飞行捕捉、冷枪战并与地雷进攻封锁相结合，进攻与防御和灵活的分散集中，又发展到以游击对“游击”，使敌伪特务武装处于我不断杀伤和恐怖中。（三）游击武装结合各方面的斗争，建立游击根据地。人民力量即可迅速得到更大的发展，就有更多的人走向武装对敌。
