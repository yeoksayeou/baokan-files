I See the Road Clearly
A Prisoner's Talk

More than six hundred Chiang Kai-shek soldiers captured in the Tangyin campaign were sitting in a spacious courtyard for a speak bitterness meeting. Ten days ago, they were still blindly slaughtering their compatriots for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Only in these ten days of actual life did they gradually understand what the Eighth Route Army in the liberated areas was all about. Eight or nine of them wanted to speak several times, but couldn't, only shed tears. So they were taught to hold a small meeting alone. After everyone had spoken of their sad experiences with tears and snivels, one of them, whose voice seemed choked, still couldn't speak, only cried. After the meeting, he pulled the company commander (a captured instructor) to a secluded place and said, "Report to the company commander, let me talk to you in your room alone!"

(The golden light of the setting sun faintly reflected in the company headquarters room. A narrow-shouldered, thin-faced prisoner sat on the edge of the kang with his head down. After seeing that only the company commander and himself were in the room, he glanced at the company commander and opened his mouth: "My name is Gao Jingwen, from the east of Zhangde Prefecture. When I was a child, my father ran a carpentry shop in Zhangde Prefecture. I went to school there for a few years. When I was sixteen, my father bought a few acres of land, and I went home to farm for two years. In the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), I was working as an external affairs officer at the 'China Third Coal Mine' in the south when I suddenly received a letter from home urging me to return immediately. When I got home, I found out that my family had suffered a great disaster. The matter was like this: that summer, my father finished his business and returned to the countryside. A local tyrant in the village suddenly cut down an acre of my family's nearly ripe wheat and sent five or six gun-toting henchmen to force my father to pay the debt, saying that my third uncle owed him an old debt when he was alive. He not only wrote the land to him, but also forced him to immediately hand over the land and clear the debt. The land was originally bought by my father from my third uncle and had been planted for several years. My father didn't know anything about the debt. Since the dead can’t speak for themselves, my father filed a complaint with Zhangde Prefecture in a fit of anger. But although we had reason, they had money. After fighting the lawsuit for several months, it came to nothing. My father was poor and had nowhere to reason, so he walked home with a stomach full of injustice. Just as he left the south gate of Zhangde Prefecture, he was beaten to death on South Gate Street by the local tyrant's henchmen who had been waiting for him!" As he spoke, tears fell on his cotton coat. "On the fourth day after I got home, I suddenly heard someone jumping over the wall in the middle of the night, followed by three Mauser bullets piercing the window paper, one hitting my right wrist." He raised his right hand to show the company commander the scars on his right wrist and the back of his hand. "At that moment, I understood that they were afraid that I would take revenge, so they struck first. I had to grit my teeth and didn't say a word. After hearing that everyone in the yard had scurried away, I ran out that night and hid in the house of a relative in a neighboring village. When the local tyrant heard that I wasn't dead, he immediately ordered the head of the Baojia system to drag me to join the 'Security Team,' insisting that it was my turn. There was no one in the family who could work. My 78-year-old grandfather and blind grandmother knelt and cried several times, but it was no use. From that time on, I shouldered a gun and became a 'soldier.'"

"Later, I don't know if the Security Team surrendered to the New Fifth Army (referring to Sun Dianying's troops), or the New Fifth Army surrendered to the 'Security Team.' I was assigned to the company as a clerk, in charge of armaments. Before I came back from home this year, I discovered that a box of five hundred rounds of ammunition was missing. I looked everywhere, but couldn't find it. Not long after this happened, the soldiers started spreading rumors. I was really afraid that the company commander would find out. I was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. Then, a gun that I was storing for someone else suddenly disappeared. I looked everywhere, but couldn't find it either. I was so worried that I couldn't sleep at night, and my eyes were bloodshot. Who is setting me up? Isn't it very clear!" He stood up angrily, his lips turned purple, and his hands and legs trembled.

The company commander asked with concern, "Isn't losing a gun punishable by death? How did you..."

He interrupted, "Three days after the gun was lost, I still hadn't dared to tell anyone. On that day, in the middle of the night, the Eighth Route Army attacked Zhongshan. The Eighth Route Army saved me! The Eighth Route Army saved me!" he repeated with emphasis.

"I see the road clearly. I can't go home. The village is still dominated by the local tyrant. I can't live if I go home. I only hope that I can join the Eighth Route Army, and in the future, we can fight together to my hometown so that I can avenge my father!"

The company commander said very moved, "You are right. When you get to the troops, as long as you work hard to improve and stand with the people, your aspirations can be easily achieved!"

Gao Jingwen smiled excitedly. Every word of the company commander was engraved in his heart. (Taihang Branch of Xinhua News Agency)

    我看清了道路
    一个俘虏兵的谈话
    汤阴战役被俘的六百多蒋军士兵坐在一个宽敞的院里开诉苦大会。十天前，他们还是盲目的替卖国贼蒋介石屠杀自己同胞，仅在这十日的实际生活中，他们才渐渐懂得解放区八路军到底是怎么回事。其中有八九个人几次要说，都说不出来，光流眼泪，于是单教他们开个小会。等大家都一把鼻涕一把泪地说出伤心事后，有一个嗓子像塞住了似的依然谈不出来，泪直流。会后他把连长（俘虏的教员）拉到一个僻静的地方说：“报告连长，让我一个人到你屋谈去吧！”
   (落日的金光淡淡地映在连部房里。一个窄肩膀瘦长脸的俘虏兵低头坐在炕沿上。他看屋里只剩下连长和自己后，看了连长一眼开口说：“我叫高景文，彰德府东边人。小时候我爹在彰德府开木匠铺，我在那里上了几年学，十六岁时，我爹买下几亩地，我就回家务了两年农。民国三十一年，我正在南边‘中国第三煤矿’当外勤，忽然接到家信催我立刻回家。到家才知道我家碰上了一场大祸。事情是这样：就在那年夏天，我爹把买卖拾掇了回到乡下，本村一个恶霸突然割了我家一亩快熟的麦子，又派五六个带枪的狗腿逼我爹还账，说是我三叔活着时候欠他老账，不但把地写给他，还强迫立刻交地清债。那地本是我爹从我三叔手买下的，种了好几年了。短钱的事，我爹根本不知道，死人口供没处对，我爹一股火告到彰德府。可是咱虽有理，人家却有钱，打了几个月官司，打个平常。我爹是人穷没处说理，就含着一肚子冤往家走，刚出彰德府南门，就被恶霸早安置下的狗腿打死在南关大街上了！”他说着说着眼泪一串串落在棉衣上：“我到家第四天半夜，忽然听到有人忽通忽通的跳墙进来，接着三颗盒子子弹穿过窗纸，一颗打进我右手腕。”他抬起右手给连长看右腕和手背上的伤疤。“当下我就明白是人家怕我报仇，先下手了。只好咬紧牙关，没哼一声，听清院里人都窜了，我才连夜跑出躲到外村亲戚家里。恶霸听说我没死，立刻叫保长拉我去当“保安队”，硬说轮到我名下。家里没一个能生产的人，我七十八岁的爷爷和瞎了眼的奶奶，跪哭了几场也没用。从那时我就扛起了枪，当开了‘兵’。”
    “后来，不知是保安队降了新五军（指孙殿英部），还是新五军降了“保安队”，我编到连里当文书，管军械，年前我由家回来，发现丢了一箱五百发的子弹，我到处找，找不见。出这事没几天当兵的就传开了，真害怕叫连长知道。正在急的像热锅上蚂蚁的时候，代存的一支枪又突然不见了，到处找，也找不着，愁得我夜里睡不着，眼睛通红，这究竟谁作下圈套害我呢？不是很明白的吗！”他气的站起来，嘴唇发紫，手腿直抖。
    连长很关心的问：“丢枪不是要枪毙吗？你怎么………”
    他截住说：“枪丢了三天，我还没敢叫一个人知道，就在那天半夜，八路军打进钟山，八路军救了我！是八路军救了我！”他加重语气重复地说。
    “我看清了道路，我不能回家，村里还是恶霸的天下，回家也不能过，我只希望我能参加八路军，将来咱们一道儿打到我家那里，好给我爹报仇！”
    连长很感动地说：“你说的很对，将来到部队，只要努力进步，跟老百姓站在一起，你的志愿很容易达到！”
    高景文兴奋地笑了，连长的话每一个字都刻在他的心里。（太行分社）
