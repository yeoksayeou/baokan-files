　　Thousands of Cadres and Masses in the Fifth District of Licheng Gather to Systematically Air Grievances and Enlighten the Backward
    [Reported from Licheng by this newspaper] Over a thousand cadres and masses from the Fifth District of Licheng held a turn-over and review meeting on the 3rd of this month. They first conducted a systematic general airing of grievances, breaking through the thinking of some backward elements and thoroughly separating them from the landlords. One farmer from Fifty Mu Village, during his grievance airing, believed that his poverty was due to having little land and bad luck, while Dong Lai Dian was rich because of good luck, having dozens of hectares of good land. The cadre retorted, "How did he get dozens of hectares of land?" Active element Wang Shanlin spoke first, "He and I are from the same family, and I know his background well. He was originally from She County, and opened a small shop after fleeing to Fifty Mu. I brought fifty strings of cash to Fifty Mu to buy land and stayed at his house for ten days. He insisted that I owed him fifty strings of cash for food, which led to me not being able to buy the land, and the money disappeared. My five family members had to beg for food. This is the root of his wealth and the root of my poverty." Wang Xiantang then added, "Li Shuquan worked hard to cultivate several hectares of wasteland, but he was forced to seize it. He was also fined 130 yuan for no reason, which drove Shuquan to his death." As a result, everyone realized that Dong Lai Dian's dozens of hectares of good land came from exploiting the poor. When discussing in Wangjia Village, active elements used facts to illustrate the cunning and rascality of the landlord. The landlord of the village, Dong Jinshu, pretended to be enlightened at the beginning of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement, surrendering all his property and 350 yuan in cash. The masses all recognized Dong Jinshu as an enlightened landlord, saying that he really had nothing left. However, during the second liquidation, another 700 yuan in cash was found in his home. During the third liquidation, more than 900 yuan in cash, more than 30 good clothes, and more than nine dan of grain were uncovered. The masses and cadres all recognized the cunning of the landlords. After liver, a consensus was reached: "Landlords and the poor are irreconcilable. We must go back and help the masses to break through their thinking and thoroughly eliminate feudalism."

　　黎城五区千余干部群众集会
    系统诉苦启发落后
    【本报黎城讯】黎城五区千余干部群众，于本月三日举行翻身检查大会，首先进行系统的总诉苦，打通部分落后分子思想，使之与地主彻底分家。五十亩村一个农民，在诉苦中认为自己穷是地少命不好，人家东来店富是命好，有十几顷好地。干部反问道：“他十几顷地是怎样来的？”积极分子王善林先说：“我和他是本家，我可摸到他的底细，他原是涉县人，逃到五十亩开了座小店，我带着五十串钱，到五十亩来买地，在他家里住了十来天，他硬说吃了他五十串钱饭，闹的地没有买成，钱也不见了，老小五口就要起饭来，这就是他的富根，也就是我的穷根。”王先堂接着说：“李树全辛辛苦苦的开了几亩荒地，也叫他强占过去了；还无故罚了一百三十元，把树全活活逼死。”这一来，大家都认识到东来店十几顷好地是剥削穷人来的。王家庄的积极分子在讨论时，用事实说明了地主的狡猾无赖，该村地主董金书，在开始查减时，他假装开期将全部家产及三百五十元现洋献了出来。群众都认董金书是开明地主，说他真是没东西了，但第二次清算时，又在他家里拿出七百块现洋。第三次清算，又搞出九百多块现洋，三十多件好衣服；粮食九石多，群众干部都认识了地主的狡猾。肝后一致认识：“地主和穷人是势不两立，回去要帮助群众都打通思想，彻底消灭封建”。
