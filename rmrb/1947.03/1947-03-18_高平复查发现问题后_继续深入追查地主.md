　　【Taiyue News, March 17th】In Gaoping, the re-examination revealed that nearly 3,000 impoverished and poor peasant households had not received an inch of land. The leadership was shocked and immediately continued in-depth re-examination. First, two reasons were found at the Yonglu base point: One was that class enemies had infiltrated the village peasant association, shielding other class enemies. The second was that landlords and local bullies organized sham struggles and sham distribution of spoils, so many impoverished and poor peasants were unable to turn themselves around. When the re-examination at the Yonglu base point reached Liujiazhuang, it was discovered that Liu Xiaomai, who had served as a puppet soldier, had infiltrated the peasant association and served as a member of the standing committee, shielding the target of struggle, Liu Yanghai. Last year, when the mass movement was in full swing, Liu Yanghai's problem was superficially dealt with by means of confiscation, but in reality, Liu Yanghai was given 15,000 yuan to invest in the cooperative. Because of this, many poor peasants did not receive an inch of land, and three impoverished families were still swallowing chaff and vegetables, and covering themselves with straw mats. In Majiazhuang, it was discovered that the landlord He Qiufa had organized a sham struggle and sham distribution of spoils. The village superficially struggled against twelve landlords and local bullies, seizing more than 700 *shi* of grain, but the poor people did not receive much, and the twelve who were struggled against divided between two and twelve *shi* among themselves. The target of struggle, Ma Yinmen, infiltrated the cooperative and also received twelve *shi* of spoils. After the Yonglu base point discovered these problems, it immediately reorganized the struggle. Liujiazhuang expelled the infiltrated traitor Liu Xiaomai from membership, and struggled against Liu Yanghai again. Majiazhuang struggled against Ma Yinmen and He Qiufa, and they alone returned 40 *shi* of grain. In the re-examination of Fushi and other villages, it was discovered that many landlords were not returning contracts, waiting for "the change of regime," and the masses immediately launched a struggle to demand contracts; Wang Deren initially stubbornly resisted returning them, but after a night of struggle, he took out the thirteen contracts and three old account books he had preserved. The masses also pursued a large number of contracts and old account books from more than twenty other targets of struggle.

　　高平复查发现问题后
    继续深入追查地主
    【本报太岳十七日电】高平在复查中发现将近三千户赤贫与贫农未分得一寸土地，领导上大吃一惊，随即继续深入复查。首先在永绿基点发现两种原因：一种是斗争对象混入村农会，包庇其他斗争对象。二是地主恶霸组织假斗争、假分配果实，因此不少赤贫与贫农未能翻身。永绿基点复查到刘家庄时，发现曾当过伪匪的刘小买混入农会充任常委，包庇斗争对象刘羊孩。在去年群运轰轰烈烈时，表面上用没收的办法对刘羊孩问题处理了一下，其实给刘羊孩在合作社入股一万五千元，因比不少贫农未分得一寸土地，三家赤贫仍旧咽着糠菜，盖着席片。在马家庄发现地主贺秋法组织假斗争、假分配果实。该村表面上斗争了十二家地主与恶霸，斗出粮食七百多石，但是穷人未分得多少，被斗争的十二家却互相分得二石至十二石。斗争对象马银门混入合作社，也分到果实十二石。永绿基点发现这些问题后，立刻重新组织斗争。刘家庄把混入的奸细刘小买开除了会籍，又斗争了刘羊孩。马家庄斗争了马银门、贺秋法，光他们就退出了粮食四十石。扶市等村在复查中发现不少地主不退文书，等待“变天”，群众即掀起要文书斗争；王德仁最初仍顽抗不退，经一夜斗争，他才将保存着的十三张文书、三本老账拿出，群众并追出其他二十多家斗争对象的文书老账甚多。
