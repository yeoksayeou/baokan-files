Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month at 3 p.m., the UNRRA ship "Wan Jing" carrying relief supplies arrived in Yantai from Shanghai. Those arriving in Yantai on the ship included UNRRA special envoys Mr. Purley, Ms. Mary Thompson, Mr. Sykes, an inspector from the American Church Committee for Relief in China, Mr. Hodson, a reporter from the Shanghai English-language China Press, Mr. Li Chengzhi, director of the Shandong Liberated Area Relief Association's Yantai office, and Mr. Li Youxue, liaison officer of the Liberated Area Relief Association's Shanghai office, also returned to Yantai on the ship. Yantai Mayor Yao Zhongming rushed to the dock to welcome them. Upon arriving ashore, Li Chengzhi told reporters: "Most of these relief goods are old and worn, including ten old trucks and more than 2,000 tents that the U.S. military used during the war in the South Pacific Islands. I don't know what use these supplies will be when they are transported to the liberated areas." His words were filled with regret.

    【新华社山东二十六日电】本月十七日下午三时，联总“万敬”号轮运载救济物资由沪抵烟，随该轮来烟者，有联总驻外特派员蒲礼＠、汤玛丽女士、美国教会驻华救济委员会视察员司克慈及上海英文大陆报记者合纳逊、山东解放区救济总会驻烟办事处主任李澄之，及解放区救济总会驻上海办事处联络官李友学氏亦乘该轮返烟。烟市市长姚仲明赶往码头欢迎。李澄之南抵岸时语记者：此次救济物多资系破旧，其中有破旧卡车十辆，及过去美军在南洋群岛作战时所用之帐篷二千余架，不知此等物资运来解放区有何用处，言下不胜遗憾。
