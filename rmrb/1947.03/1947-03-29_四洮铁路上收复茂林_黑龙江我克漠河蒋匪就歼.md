    Xinhua News Agency, South Manchuria, 27th -- The Chiang Kai-shek troops who invaded Maolin, an important town on the Siping-Taonan Railway, 80 miles north of Liaoyuan, retreated southward in fear of being annihilated by the Democratic Allied Army. The town of Maolin has now returned to the hands of the people.

    Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 27th -- A unit of the Democratic Allied Army in the Heihe area entered the city of Mohe on the bank of the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, on the extreme northern border, on the 20th of this month. The bandit gang Zhang Bojun and his troops, who were entrenched in the area and commissioned by Chiang Kai-shek, were largely annihilated. The pseudo-regimental commander Zhang Bojun himself was also killed. The people's armed forces suffered no casualties. They are currently pursuing and annihilating the remaining bandits.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th -- (Delayed) A reporter from the Songhua River front of this agency reports: The following is a scene of annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's 88th Division -- After a day and a half of forced march, the warriors of a unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, who were originally more than 200 li away, ambushed near the highway from the east of Liu Jiatun in northeast of Nong'an to Kaoshantun. This was around 1:00 AM on the 11th, the sky was dark, and the cold wind was howling. All the light and heavy weapons were appropriately deployed. The eighth squad circled to the right of the highway. Every warrior held a grenade and waited breathlessly for the commander's order. Half an hour later, seven Chiang Kai-shek's cars with dazzling lights sped from Kaoshantun towards Liu Jiatun. "Why isn't the order given?" "I think it's going to be a big one." "Don't worry, the superiors must have a plan. Didn't you see that there were not many people in the cars? Why bother attacking them?" "Wait, let's reel in a big one, there must be more behind." The soldiers whispered. Sure enough, a column of more than 20 American-style trucks led by three armored cars, illuminating with bright lights, crawled over. However, the cars stopped two li away from the village, and the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers jumped out of the cars and spread out to search forward to the left and right. When they entered the village, the armored cars and trucks went to the front again. The soldiers saw clearly that the whistle sounded when the first three cars entered the village. The soldiers jumped up suddenly, and grenades, machine guns, and artillery fire erupted at the same time. The fire illuminated the night sky. With a sudden and overwhelming firepower, the so-called armored troops of Chiang Kai-shek's 88th Division, nearly two battalions, who had separated from their "armor", were immediately thrown into chaos and scrambled to flee. But they were immediately ambushed by the eighth squad. A row of machine guns and a burst of grenades knocked down more than 200 people. The remaining ones scrambled to climb a small hill. At dawn, the eighth squad braved the dense fire and charged up for close combat. In an instant, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were captured, and only about 100 escaped in the chaos. Dozens of burning car wrecks lay on the road near the village, and oil stains stained the withered grass by the roadside.

    四洮铁路上收复茂林
    黑龙江我克漠河蒋匪就歼
    【新华社南满二十七日电】侵距辽源北八十里四洮铁路线上重镇茂林之蒋军，深恐被民主联军消灭，近日向南退却，茂林镇乃重归人民手中。
    【新华社西满二十七日电】黑河地区民主联军某部，于本月二十日进驻黑龙江上游岸旁极北国境线上之漠河城，盘踞该地受蒋贼委派之胡匪张伯军所部已大部就歼，伪团长张伯军本人亦被击毙，人民武装毫无伤亡，现正追歼残匪中。
    【新华社东北二十七日电】（迟到）本社松花江前线记者报导：下面是歼灭蒋军八十八师的一个镜头——经一天半的强行军后，原在二百多里以外的东北民主联军一部勇士们，伏在农安东北刘家屯以南的东往靠山屯的公路附近，这是十一号清晨一时左右，天色漆黑，寒风呼啸，所有的轻重武器都已作最适当的布置，第八小队绕到公路的右方，每个勇士都按住手榴弹屏息以待指挥员的命令。半小时后，七辆闪着耀眼灯光的蒋军汽车，东从靠山屯方向驰向刘家屯去了。“为什么不发命令呢”？“我看是要干大的”，“你放心，上级一定有计划，你不是瞧见车上没有什么人，打它干吗？”“等着吧放长线捉大鱼，后面一定还有”。战士们纷纷小声议论着。不一会，果然有以三辆装甲汽车为前导的一列二十余辆美式大卡车探照着朗朗的灯光爬过来，可是在离村还有两里地的地方汽车停了，蒋军士兵都跳下车来向前后左右分开搜索前进。当进村时，装甲车和大卡车又走到了前面，战士们看的清楚，当前面三辆车刚进村时号声响了，战士们蓦地跳起，一时手榴弹机枪和炮声大作，火花照明了夜空，以猛然压倒一切的火力，使脱离了“装甲”的蒋军八十八师将近两个营的所谓装甲部队，立刻混乱不堪，拔脚后窜，但立即遭到八小队伏击，一排机枪和一阵手榴弹，就足足打倒了两百多人，剩下的忙着爬上一个小岭子。天快明时，第八小队冒着密集火网冲上去短兵相接，霎时蒋军三百余名被俘，只有百余人乘乱逃窜。数十辆燃烧着的汽车残骸躺在村边路上，油渍染污了道旁的枯草。
