　　Egyptian Prime Minister Officially Announces
    Egypt-UK Issue Submitted to UN Security Council
    Reason: Britain Refuses to Withdraw Troops and Occupies Sudan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th] Agence France-Presse, Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy officially announced on the 3rd that Egypt has decided to submit the dispute with Britain to the United Nations Security Council. Nokrashy stated that during the months of negotiations with Britain, Egypt had made every possible effort to reach an agreement with Britain. The failure of the negotiations lies in Britain's inability to meet Egypt's two main demands: that British troops immediately withdraw from Egypt without the need to sign a treaty, and that Egypt's sovereignty over Sudan be restored.
