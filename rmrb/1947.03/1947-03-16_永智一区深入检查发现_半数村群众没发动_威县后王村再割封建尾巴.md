[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, dated 14th] After an in-depth inspection of Yongzhi First District, many serious problems were discovered, with the masses in over half of the villages not mobilized. The entire district can be roughly divided into four types of villages: 1. Villages where the masses have been mobilized, feudal forces have been eliminated, and the fruits of struggle are reasonably distributed, achieving "land to the tiller," with sound mass organizations and cultivation of mass leaders. There are thirteen villages of this type. 2. Villages where feudal forces have been defeated, the masses have obtained some fruits, but the distribution is biased, mass organizations are unsound, and village cadres are detached from the masses. There are twenty-two villages of this type. 3. Villages where the masses have not been mobilized, feudal forces have not been eliminated, a few people monopolize and manipulate matters, or there is sham struggle, and mass organizations are ineffective. There are twenty-three villages of this type. 4. Small villages without landlords and villages near enemy areas that have not been moved have a total of twenty-six. Out of the eighty-four villages in the district, the masses have not been mobilized in forty-nine; even in the thirty-three villages where mobilization was relatively full or once initiated, many problems still exist. Based on the above inspection, the cadres' complacency has been shattered. Efforts are now being reorganized by transferring village cadres and activists to form land reform inspection teams to conduct in-depth mobilization.

[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, dated 14th] During the rent reduction campaign in Houwang Village, Wei County, many landlords and feudal rich peasants were liquidated. After the rent reduction, under the spirit of further eliminating feudalism and cutting off feudal remnants, a serious inspection was conducted again. According to the results of the door-to-door inspection by each group of the Peasants' Association, it was found that there were still five landlord households that had not been liquidated. These households appeared to own little land and did not seem very wealthy; however, from the perspective of their business methods, they all lived off exploitation without labor, so it was decided to liquidate them again. After democratic discussion by each group, different landlords were treated differently. For example, landlord Wang Zhaozai, a military dependent, was left with nine mu of land, and the rest of his belongings were left untouched; for the widowed and lonely landlord Wang Lizhi and Pei Yin's family, the former was left with eight mu of land, the house and its contents untouched, and the latter was left with eight mu of land, three rooms, and the rest of his belongings untouched. For teacher Zhang Qiyong's family, because he taught and served the masses, the land was left untouched, but he only had to vacate eight rooms. As for the mother of female tyrant Wang Zhaolin, the masses unanimously demanded to thoroughly defeat her ferocity, and it was resolved to let the women struggle against her.

　　永智一区深入检查发现
    半数村群众没发动
    威县后王村再割封建尾巴
    【本报冀南十四日电】永智一区经过深入检查，发现存在着许多严重问题，半数以上村群众没发动。全区大体可分为四种类型村庄：一、群众已发动，消灭了封建势力，比较合理的分子斗争果实，实现了耕者有其田，群众组织健全，培养了群众领袖，这类村庄共有十三个。二、打垮了封建势力，群众得到些果实，但分配有偏向，群众组织不健全，村干脱离群众，这类村共有二十二个村。三、群众没发动起来，封建势力仍未消灭，少数人包办操纵或假斗争，群众组织不起作用，这类村共有二十三个。四、没地主的小村及靠近敌区未动的村共有廿六个。全区共有八十四个村，群众没发动起来的占四十九个；就是发动比较充分和一度发动过的三十三村，也还存在许多问题。根据以上检查，打破了干部自满思想。现正重新组织力量抽调村干积极分子，组织翻身检查队，深入发动。
    【本报冀南十四日电】威县后王村查减中，对许多地主、封建富农进行了清算。查减后，在进一步消灭封建及割掉封建尾巴的精神下，又认真进行检查。按农会各小组挨门挨户检查结果，发现仍有地主五户未清算。这些户表面看拥有土地不多，富力也不大；但从经营方式看都是不劳而食靠剥削度日的，故决定再行清算。经各小组民主讨论，对不同地主分别处理。如对军属地主王兆宰留下九亩地，其他东西不动；对孤寡地主王立志家及裴银家，前者留下八亩地，宅子东西不动，后者留下八亩地，三间房子，其他东西不动。对教员张其永家，因他教书为群众服务，土地不动，只退出八间房子。对女恶霸王兆林的娘，群众一致要求彻底斗垮她的凶焰，决议让妇女斗争她。
