    Nangong District One Training Camp Active Elements
    Deepen Examination of Feudalism
    [This Dispatch from Southern Hebei, 24th] The West Sub-district of Nangong District One gathered over 200 male and female activists from eight villages for ideological education. The activists examined their own ideological obstacles that hindered the thorough elimination of feudalism and the full mobilization of the masses. For example, Banbizhuang believed that the struggle was over after it had happened, and were afraid that the village representatives would think that if the masses came to meetings quickly and fought fiercely, they would not be fully mobilized. Xin Zhuang representatives believed that there were no targets of struggle in the village, and the masses had not been mobilized, so there was no way to fully mobilize the masses. Based on this, the leadership provided patient education, emphasizing that the full mobilization of the masses and the thorough completion of land reform would ensure that not a single feudal landlord remained. The goal was not only to have land to cultivate, food to eat, and social status, but also to truly understand from an ideological perspective how land, food, and status came about, and how to maintain them in the long term. It was proposed that upon returning, a thorough examination should be conducted to determine whether the feudal landlords had been defeated, whether the masses' awareness had been raised, and whether the activists themselves still had any tendencies to be detached from the masses and hinder them from achieving complete liberation. Finally, the accurate review content mainly included a major land inspection, thorough elimination of landlords, and ensuring that the common people were truly in charge. The above issues were combined with the specific circumstances of each village, and lively group discussions were launched. Each village challenged each other to compete in achieving liberation, all with the confidence of never falling behind, promoting the inspection movement to move forward.

    南宫一区集训积极分子
    深入一步检查封建
    【本报冀南二十四日电】南宫一区西小区集合八个村的男女积极分子二百余人，进行思想教育，积极分子检查出本身存在阻碍彻底消灭封建、充分发动群众的思想障碍。如半壁庄认为斗争过去就算完事大吉，怕村代表认为群众开会到的快、斗的急就不发动充分。新庄代表认为村里没有斗的对象，群众也没起来，再没办法充分发动群众。据此领导上作了耐心的教育，强调充分发动群众，把土地改革要作彻底，不留一个封建地主，不但有地种有饭吃有社会地位，还要从思想上真正明白土地、饭碗、地位是怎样来的，怎么才能保住长久，并提出回去后彻底检查封建地主是否打垮，群众的觉悟是否提高，本身是否还有脱离群众阻碍群众翻透身的地方。最后准确复查的内容主要是土地大检查，彻底消灭地主，老百姓真正当家。以上问题结合了各村具体情况，开展了热烈的小组讨论，各村互相挑战竞赛翻身，都抱着绝不落后的信心，推动检查运动向前开展。
