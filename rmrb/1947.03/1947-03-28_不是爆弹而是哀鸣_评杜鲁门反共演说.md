Not a Bomb, But a Wail
A Critique of Truman's Anti-Communist Speech

    In his speech to the U.S. Congress on March 12th regarding "aid to Greece and Turkey," Truman openly raised the anti-communist slogan. After the speech was delivered, strong opposition resounded throughout the world, and it was opposed within the United States by people's organizations, democrats, and Wallace. If there is any characteristic of Truman's speech, it can be pointed out in three aspects: First, Truman picked up the anti-communist banner, a reactionary banner that was used by Hitler, tattered, failed, and foul-smelling; second, Truman openly declared that he would aid "democratic countries" like Greece, whose reactionary government's traitorous autocracy, corruption, and darkness ranked first in the world; third, Truman set a precedent, that if in the past American imperialism always tried to obtain the consent of other countries or several major powers, at least on the surface, when interfering in other countries' internal affairs, this time the interference in Greece and Turkey was for "American security," and he simply acted arbitrarily without the consent of any country. These three characteristics add up to one characteristic, that is, Truman openly exposed the hideous face of American imperialism.

    American imperialism has always been known for its adeptness at deception. Why this time did the American financial oligarchs have to prop up that poor, incapable President Truman, and have him deliver a Hitler-style "bomb speech," a General Scobie-style declaration, an all-out arbitrary posture? Isn't this very incongruous?

    The reason is that American imperialists are now in an unprecedentedly difficult position in history. They are wailing, and they have no other way but to resort to such methods.

    The unprecedented difficulties of American imperialists are manifested in three aspects, namely, an anti-Soviet war cannot be launched, the rapid progress of the world's people cannot be contained, and the American economic crisis is imminent. These three things are so certain that even the most stubborn reactionaries cannot deny them. When Churchill delivered his reactionary speech last March, the difference from when Truman delivered his speech this March is that last March the American reactionaries had not yet realized that their unprecedented difficulties would inevitably come, and they still thought that an anti-Soviet war was still possible; the people of the world could be quelled by deception and oppression; and the economic crisis would not necessarily come quickly. But this March, they had a clear awareness, knowing that their fantasies did not correspond to reality, knowing that their difficulties were so great, so they simply nakedly acted as imperialists, thinking that this might be more beneficial than hidden aggression.

    Hidden aggression can no longer work. Naked imperialist aggression will only work to some extent under the following conditions, that is, the people still have the weakness of fearing the reactionaries in spirit, and the weakness of overestimating the strength of the reactionaries, and there is still the possibility of being frightened by the reactionaries. If the people do not have this spiritual weakness, or can overcome this spiritual weakness, then the American reactionaries' "new policy" will only have one result, and that result is the further isolation, greater weakness, and increased difficulty of the American reactionaries.

    Now the people of the whole world, after the tempering of the anti-fascist war, have personally witnessed the downfall of Hitler's Germany and Japanese imperialism, so the people of the whole world have a profound understanding of the reactionary nature of the financial oligarchs, and at the same time, their fragility. After World War II, this understanding was further enhanced due to the perseverance and victory of China's patriotic self-defense war, the perseverance and victory of the Greek guerrilla war, the perseverance and victory of the Philippine guerrilla war, and the perseverance and victory of the independence wars in Vietnam and Indonesia, thus the vast people of the world more greatly scorn the reactionaries. This is one of the necessary prerequisites for the people of the world to achieve their own liberation. Without despising the reactionaries and fearing them, the people have no hope of liberation.

    After World War II, among the bourgeoisie of the whole world, only the American and British bourgeoisie still retained some illusions and fears of them among the people, and the American and British financial oligarchs took advantage of this point of illusion and this point of fear; in other words, they used the spiritual weaknesses in the people, especially the British and American people, to maintain their rule and make the people of the world continue to live a sorrowful life. The American reactionaries previously shouted loudly about the "atomic bomb," and now they are doing their best to render Truman's speech as a "bomb speech," the purpose of which is to use the spiritual weakness of the people in order to scare the people, rule the people, and poison the people. One of the most important tasks now for the workers' parties and democrats of the world, especially in the United States and Britain, is to constantly educate the people to overcome their spiritual weaknesses, not to have illusions about the bourgeoisie, nor to be afraid of it, but to expose its reactionary nature and at the same time despise it.

    May I ask, how much "explosiveness" does Truman's speech actually have? At most, it is just 400 million US dollars plus 350 million US dollars in relief funds. Such a small amount is not enough for the corruption of officials in Greece, a small country! If all of it is used in China, it is only 3.75 percent of the 200 billion US dollars of the entire private property of the Four Big Families. What good would that do? Do the American imperialists have any magical way to fill the ocean with a cup of water! As for training troops and equipping troops, the United States had already tried hard to do it in China, and Britain had already tried hard to do it in Greece, and neither of them worked. What good will it do to do it again this time?

    Not a bomb but a wail. That is how Truman's speech should be viewed. As for U.S. Undersecretary of State Acheson's statement that the United States does not want China to have a government dominated by the Communist Party, then the American reactionaries are allowed to say whatever they want in the United States; as for the fate of China, it is determined by the Chinese people, and it is not determined by the likes and dislikes of Mr. Acheson, an American reactionary. American reactionaries have long been interfering in China's internal affairs. Their ability is only so great. None of the Chinese people are afraid of them, and they believe that they will soon be able to use their own strength to drive out American imperialism from China, just like driving out the "anti-communist" Japanese imperialism.

    不是爆弹而是哀鸣
    评杜鲁门反共演说
    在杜鲁门三月十二日在美国国会关于“援助希土”的演说，公然提出了反共口号。这个演说发表后，在全世界响起了强烈的反对的声浪，在美国内部也受到人民团体、民主人士的和华莱士的反对。如果要说杜鲁门的这个演说有什么特点的话，那末可以指出三点：第一是杜鲁门拾起了反共的旗帜，这面旗帜乃是希特勒用过了的、破烂了的、失败了的、臭不可闻的反动旗帜；第二是杜鲁门公然宣言要去援助像希腊这样的“民主国家”，这个“民主国家”反动政府的卖国专制腐败黑暗，是在世界上列于第一等的；第三是杜鲁门开了一个先例，如果过去美国帝国主义干涉别国内政时，还总想办法至少表面上要取得别国或几个强国的同意，那末这次干涉希土就为了“美国的安全”，干脆不得任何国家的同意而独断独行。这三个特点总起来是一个特点，就是杜鲁门公开暴露了美国帝国主义的狰狞容貌。
    美国帝国主义素来以善于欺骗著称，为什么这一次美国的金融寡头要把那可怜的无能力的总统杜鲁门撑出来，要他来一个希特勒式的“爆弹演说”，来一个斯科比将军式的宣言，来一个不顾一切独断独行的姿态呢？这岂不是很不调和的么？
    原因就在于美国帝国主义者现在处在历史上空前未有的困难地位，他们在哀鸣了，他们除了这样的办法以外，毫无别的办法了。
    美国帝国主义者空前未有的困难表现在三方面，即反苏战争是打不起来了，世界人民的迅速进步是遏制不住了，而美国的经济危机却紧迫着要到来了。这三件事是如此的确定，连最顽固的反动派也不能不承认。去年三月邱吉尔发表反动演说之时，与今年三月杜鲁门发表演说之时，其不同之点就在去年三月美国的反动派还没有自觉到他们的空前困难必会到来，还以为反苏战争仍有可能；世界人民可以用欺骗和压迫的办法平息下去；经济危机不一定很快到来。而今年三月，他们却有了明确的自觉，知道自己的幻想不合于事实，知道自己的困难是那末巨大，因此他们就索性赤裸裸的做帝国主义者，他们以为这样比隐隐藏藏的侵略或许更有利些。
    隐隐藏藏的侵略已经不能顶事了，赤裸裸的帝国主义侵略，只有在下述条件之下才会多少顶事，这条件就是人民在精神上还有畏惧反动派的弱点，还有过高估计反动派力量的弱点，还有被反动派吓坏的可能。如果人民没有这个精神上的弱点，或者能够克服这个精神上的弱点，那末美国反动派的“新政策”便只有一个结果，这个结果就是美国反动派的更加孤立，更加无力，更加困难。
    现在全世界的人民经过了反法西斯战争的锻炼，他们亲眼看到希特勒德国和日本帝国主义的倒台，所以全世界人民对于金融寡头们的反动性，同时对其脆弱性是有了深刻认识的。这种认识在第二次世界大战之后，由于中国的爱国自卫战争的坚持与胜利，由于希腊游击战争的坚持与胜利，由于菲律宾游击战争的坚持与胜利，以及由于越南与印度尼西亚独立战争的坚持与胜利，而更加增强了世界广大人民藐视反动派。这是世界人民取得自己解放的必要的前提之一，不藐视反动派而惧怕反动派，人民就没有解放的希望。
    第二次世界大战之后，全世界的资产阶级中只剩下美国的和英国的资产阶级在人民中还保留着若干对他们的幻想和恐惧，而美国和英国的金融寡头则利用了这点幻想与这点恐惧；换句话说，利用了人民中特别是英美人民中精神上的弱点维持其统治，并使世界人民继续过着愁苦的生活。美国反动派以前所以大叫“原子弹”，现在又把杜鲁门演说竭力渲染为“爆弹演说”，其目的都在利用人民精神上的弱点，以便吓唬人民，统治人民，毒害人民。世界的特别是美英两国的工人政党与民主人士，现在的最重要任务之一，就是不断的教育人民克服精神上的弱点，不要对资产阶级幻想，亦不要怕它，而要揭露它的反动性，同时又藐视它。
    试问杜鲁门演说的“爆弹性”究竟有多少呢？充其量不过是四万万美金再加上三万万五千万美金救济费而已。这样的微小之数，全部用到希腊一小国还不够那里官僚的贪污呢！如果全部用到中国来，只抵四大家族全部私产二百万万美金的百分之三·七五，那又顶得什么事？美国帝国主义者难道有什么神法可以用一杯水填满海洋么！至于训练军队，装备军队那一套，美国早在中国努力做过，英国也早在希腊努力做过，也都没有顶过什么事，此次再做一番，又得顶什么事呢？
    不是爆弹而是哀鸣，对杜鲁门演说应该如此看法。至于美国副国务卿亚泽逊宣称：美国不愿中国有共产党占优势的政府，那末美国反动派在美国是容许它讲话的自由的；至于中国的命运，那是由中国人民来决定的，并不以亚泽逊先生一个美国反动派的好恶来决定。美国反动派干涉中国内政由来已久，它的本领只有那末大，中国人民谁也不怕它，而且相信不久必能以自己的力量，像赶走“防共”的日本帝国主义一样，把美国帝国主义也赶出中国去。
