(This report from Taihang, 11th) The armed consciousness of farmers in various parts of Taihang who have newly obtained land has been consciously raised, and they all request to participate in defending their emancipation. Farmers in Ganquan Village, She County, said: "To overthrow Little Chiang (referring to the local tyrant landlord) we must also overthrow the big tyrant Old Chiang, only then can we protect the land." Countless villages, all farmers, have requested to join the militia. Ganquan expanded by 25 people in one instance. In addition, the militias in various places are actively building. For example, farmers in Nanzhuang Village pooled 200,000 yuan to purchase weapons. Villagers in Huyukou, Yantou and other villages all pooled funds into cooperative production as regular armed construction costs. The militia villagers of Luting, Neiqiu, also established a small-scale militia cooperative, achieving self-sufficiency in ammunition costs.

　　鲁亭建立民兵小型合作社
    做到弹药自给
    【本报太行十一日电】太行各地新获得土地的农民武装自觉提高，均要求参加保卫翻身。涉县甘泉村农民说：打倒小蒋（指村中恶霸地主）还要打倒大恶霸老蒋，土地才保得住。无数村庄全体农民均要求参加民兵，甘泉一次即扩大廿五人。此外各地民兵并积极建设，如南庄村农民集资二十万元购买武器，胡峪、沿头等村全集资投入合作社生产，作经常的武装建设费。内邱鲁亭村民兵并建立民兵小型合作社，做到了弹药费的自给。
