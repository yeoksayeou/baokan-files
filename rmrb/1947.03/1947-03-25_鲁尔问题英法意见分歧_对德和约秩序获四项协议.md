Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: Moscow Dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Conference's discussions on the principles of dealing with Germany's economy and the issue of reparations have lasted for four days and have not yet reached an agreement. At the 20th meeting, most of the time was spent discussing the issue of German coal production and the handling of the Ruhr question, with British and French representatives holding opposing views. Bidault declared in the discussion that guaranteeing France's access to German coal was a prerequisite for negotiating any agreement on the German economy. Bevin denied Bidault's demands regarding coal and repeatedly refused to establish four-power control in the Ruhr. Bidault, on the other hand, demanded that "special control" of the Ruhr must be established as soon as possible. Another part of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was devoted to listening to Vyshinsky's work report on the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on Germany. Vyshinsky stated that the assistants had reached agreements on the following points in preparing for the post-war order with Germany: First, the peace treaty with Germany will be drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference (whose members include the Foreign Ministers of the countries that signed the German Instrument of Surrender). Second, the assistants accepted the French delegation's proposal to establish four permanent committees of the Foreign Ministers' Conference to study various issues related to the peace treaty with Germany. Third, the assistants agreed to establish an information consultation committee, which is responsible for the following tasks: (1) To periodically inform the governments of all allied countries of the progress of the Foreign Ministers' Conference in preparing the peace treaty with Germany. (2) To transmit all documents related to the Foreign Ministers' Conference's preparation of the peace treaty with Germany to the governments of all allied countries. (3) To exchange memoranda on the German question with representatives of the governments of all allied countries. (4) The Foreign Ministers' Conference shall provide the representatives of the governments of all allied countries with all possible opportunities to make any statements on the German question at the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: Moscow Dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on Germany, chaired by British representative Strang on the 19th, discussed the report of the Allied Reparations Agency while carrying out the work submitted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 18th. The representatives stated to the Foreign Ministers' Conference their opinions on the issue of reparations. After a lengthy discussion, the assistants failed to reach a resolution on this topic. The points of disagreement will be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. At the conclusion of the meeting, the assistants discussed the procedures for preparing the peace treaty with Germany.
