　　Land Reform Combined with Spring Plowing
    Spring plowing has arrived, and some cadres feel that land reform is "almost done" and it is time to switch to production. This "almost done" thinking must be corrected. Experiences in various places have proven that completely eliminating feudalism, thoroughly mobilizing the backward elements, and truly achieving fair and reasonable distribution of the fruits is not an easy task. The Xingtai Emancipated Hero Conference (see page two of today's newspaper) proposed continuing to repeatedly check land reform in the production movement to achieve truly equal land distribution, leaving no backward masses behind, which is entirely correct. This is in line with the spirit of Comrade Nie Zhen's instructions before the departure of the Central Bureau's Land Reform Inspection Group: "To resolutely implement it to the end, and strive to thoroughly solve the land problem within this year." It is hoped that cadres in various regions will conscientiously understand this spirit, combine land reform with spring plowing based on local conditions, and create methods of combining them.

　　土地改革结合春耕
    春耕到了，有的干部觉得土地改革“差不多”了，要转入生产了。这种“差不多”思想必须纠正。各地经验证明，彻底消灭封建，彻底发动落后，真正做到果实分得公平合理，不是一件容易的事。邢台翻身英雄大会（见今日本报二版）提出在生产运动中继续反复检查土地改革，做到真正平均分配土地，不留一个落后群众，是完全正确的。这正符合聂真同志在中央局土地改革考察团出发前所指出“一直放手贯彻到底，争取今年一年内彻底解决土地问题”的精神。希望各地干部，认真体会这种精神，根据当地情形，把土地改革与春耕结合进行，并创造结合的办法。
