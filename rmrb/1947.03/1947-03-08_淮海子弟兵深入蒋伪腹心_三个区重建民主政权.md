　　Huaihai Soldiers Deepen into the Enemy's Heart
    Three Districts Re-establish Democratic Regime
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th] A certain company of the Huaihai soldiers penetrated deep into the enemy's heartland to carry out guerrilla warfare. In twenty days, they fought more than thirty battles, killing 370 enemy soldiers and "Homecoming Corps" members at the cost of one casualty and one injury. They captured more than 50 alive, destroyed one enemy district office and four township offices, and restored the democratic regime in three districts in the triangular area of more than 500 square miles east of the Huaiyin-Shuyang Road and south of the Lianshui-Guzhai Road, rescuing more than 50,000 people.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th] Following the military victory, the democratic governments of Xinghua, Qintong, Dongtai, Taipei, Rugao and other counties in Central Jiangsu are working hard to restore district work in order to reduce enemy-occupied areas and expand liberated areas. In the past two months, Taipei County (Dongtai) alone has restored fifteen townships, and has largely destroyed the enemy regime from Fuan and Libao to Bicha in Dongtai, forcing the enemy troops to be trapped in a few strongholds. According to the restoration work in Dongtai and Taipei, there are the following experiences: (1) The key to whether or not it can be restored lies in whether the cadres have the determination and whether they rely on the masses; (2) Before the situation is opened, the enemy's "Homecoming Corps," "Security Team" and other organizations should be disintegrated first to eliminate the concerns of the masses, and at the same time supplemented by political propaganda; (3) After the situation is opened, the masses should be mobilized immediately, and the movement to eliminate traitors should be launched to promote national democratic integrity.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th] The prices in the liberated areas of northern Jiangsu are stable and the commerce is prosperous. Taking Sheyang Town as an example, in recent months, due to the widespread attacks by the New Fourth Army, the prices of various goods have generally dropped by one-third. The price of rice per stone has dropped from 50,000 Central China Bank notes to more than 30,000 yuan, and the price of matches per dozen has dropped from 1,100 yuan to 700 yuan. More than 90 new stores have been restored in the town, and one Baofeng Silver Store and six fresh fish shops have been newly opened. The daily business of Dacheng Store is 2 million yuan. The general price level in the town is often one-third cheaper than that in Bao Ying City, which is only about 30 kilometers away and occupied by the enemy.

　　淮海子弟兵深入蒋伪腹心
    三个区重建民主政权
    【新华社华中五日电】淮海子弟兵某连深入蒋伪腹心地区，开展游击战，二十天中作战三十余次，以伤亡各一的代价毙蒋军及“还乡团”三百七十余，生擒五十余，摧毁蒋记区署一，乡公所四，在淮（阴）沭（阳）路以东涟（水）古（寨）路以南五百余平方华里的三角地带恢复三个区的民主政权，解救群众五万余。
    【新华社华中五日电】随着军事胜利，苏中兴化、溱潼、东台、台北、如皋等县民主政府正努力进行恢复区工作。以缩小蒋占区，扩大解放区。两个月来仅台（东台）北一县即已恢复十五个乡，并将东台境内富安李堡至栟茶一线蒋政权大部摧毁，迫使蒋军困守少数据点内。根据东台、台北恢复工作有如下经验：（一）能否恢复之关键，在于干部是否有决心，是否依靠群众；（二）在局面打开之前，应首先瓦解蒋记“还乡团”、“保安队”等组织，解除群众顾虑，同时辅以政治宣传；（三）在局面打开后应立即放手发动群众，展开肃奸运动，发扬民族民主正气。
    【新华社华中五日电】苏北解放区物价平稳，商业繁荣，以射阳镇为例近月来因受新四军广泛出击的影响，各货普遍下降三分之一，食米每石由华中银行币五万元降至三万余元，火柴每打由一千一百元降至七百元，全镇新恢复商店九十余家，增开宝凤银号一家，鲜鱼行六家，大成商店每日营业二百万元，该镇一般物价常较相距仅约三十公里之蒋占宝应城便宜三分之一。
