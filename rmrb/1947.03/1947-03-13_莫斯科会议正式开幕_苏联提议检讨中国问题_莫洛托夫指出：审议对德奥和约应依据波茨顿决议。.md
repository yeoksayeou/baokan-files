Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 11th: TASS, Moscow, March 10th: The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference officially opened at 5 PM today in the Aviation Industry Building. The meeting hall was adorned with the flags of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. In addition to the four foreign ministers, members of the four national delegations were present, including Vyshinsky, Gusev, Soviet Marshal Sokolovsky, Smirnov, and Seminov from the Soviet Union; Hood, Hall-Patch, and Dixon from the United Kingdom; Cohen, Murphy, Bohlen, Dulles, and General Clark from the United States; and General Jadoux, Moraville, Alphand, and Audoin from France. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presided over the opening of the first session of the Foreign Ministers Conference and delivered a brief opening speech, stating: "Gentlemen! On behalf of the Soviet government and myself, I welcome the chief representatives of the British, American, and French delegations: Mr. Bevin, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Bidault, and their assistants. During our last meeting in New York, we established the plan for this conference. We will have to review several important issues regarding the German peace treaty and discuss the Austrian peace treaty. Our current task is not easy, but we have a reliable foundation for working together, primarily the historical resolutions on the German question passed at the Crimean Conference and the Berlin Conference (i.e., the Potsdam Conference). The London Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies and the Allied Control Council for Germany have been tasked with discussing the German and Austrian issues, and have already done a great deal of useful work, presenting the necessary materials and suggestions for our consideration. Please allow me to wish success to this conference, which begins today. Now, let us proceed with the current business."

British Foreign Secretary Bevin then spoke, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the British delegation to the Soviet government for its hospitality and emphasizing the importance of the work before the conference. He proposed that Molotov, as the representative of the host government, should chair the first meeting. French Foreign Minister Bidault and US Secretary of State Marshall both seconded the motion, emphasizing the significance of this Foreign Ministers Conference and the importance of the work it undertakes. Molotov pointed out that all members of the Foreign Ministers Conference were eager for the success of this conference. Molotov accepted the invitation to serve as Chairman of the first meeting, expressed his gratitude to his colleagues, and suggested that the Foreign Ministers Conference should establish a procedure for rotating the chairmanship. Following this, the Foreign Ministers Conference decided on several organizational matters and proceeded with discussions on procedures.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 11th: According to TASS, Moscow: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made a statement at the first session of the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference on the 10th, stating: "The Soviet delegation would like to make a suggestion regarding the agenda. As is well known, at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union in December 1945, the three foreign ministers unanimously agreed on the necessity of achieving unification and democratization in China under the guidance of the Nationalist Government, the necessity of broad participation of democratic elements in all institutions of the Chinese democratic government, and the necessity of ending the civil war. The three foreign ministers further reaffirmed adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. The US and Soviet foreign ministers reached a complete agreement on the willingness to withdraw Soviet and American troops stationed in China as early as possible after fulfilling their obligations and responsibilities. Since the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, the situation in China has not improved. Therefore, the Soviet government proposes that the Foreign Ministers Conference hear reports from the participants in the Moscow Conference agreement on the implementation of the agreement regarding the China question." Molotov, in explaining the Soviet delegation's proposal, reminded: "The China question was discussed at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union in December 1945, and a decision was passed. The Soviet delegation proposes that this Foreign Ministers Conference hear a report on the implementation of the decision regarding the China question passed at the Moscow Conference. When discussing this issue in December 1945, it was from the perspective of the participating nations in the conference. Everyone knows that Chinese representatives did not participate in the conference at that time. At that time, the foreign ministers believed that the decisions they passed did not require the presence of Chinese representatives. That conference was directly related to the policies of the participating governments; and now, what is needed at the conference is only a report on the implementation of the decisions passed at that time. In my opinion, there is no need to invite Chinese representatives to participate in the conference, because the representatives did not participate in the formulation of the agreement passed in December 1945. Here, the Soviet government's proposal is as follows: to hear a report from the participants in the last Moscow Conference on the implementation of the decisions regarding the China question from that conference. The Soviet delegation does not object to considering and discussing this issue in an additional session of the Foreign Ministers Conference at a time that is convenient for all parties." US Chief Representative Marshall, in his speech, agreed to discuss this issue at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, but requested time to consider the procedure for reviewing this issue. The conference participants agreed to postpone consideration of the Soviet delegation's proposal until the next meeting on the 11th.

　　莫斯科会议正式开幕
    苏联提议检讨中国问题
    莫洛托夫指出：审议对德奥和约应依据波茨顿决议。
    【新华社延安十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：莫斯科外长会议今日下午五时在航空工业大厦正式开幕，会场满悬苏、美、英、法等国旗。与会者除四国外长外，有四国代表团之团员，计苏联有维辛斯基、古赛夫、苏联元帅索科洛夫斯基、斯米尔洛夫及赛米诺夫。英国有胡德、霍尔巴奈及狄克森。美国有柯亨、穆菲、波伦、杜勒斯及克拉克将军。法国有贾德鲁将军、摩维尔、阿尔亨德及阿杜恩。苏外长莫洛托夫主持外长会议首次会议之揭幕，并致简短开幕词称：“各位先生！我代表苏联政府和我个人、欢迎英、美、法代表团各位首席代表：贝文先生、马歇尔先生、比道尔先生，以及他们的助理。我们在上次纽约会议中，曾制定了这届会议的计划，我们将必须审议若干关于对德和约的重要问题，并讨论对奥和约问题。我们当前的任务并不容易，但是我们有着共同工作的可靠基础，首先是克里米亚会议及柏林会议（即波茨顿会议）所通过的关于德国问题的历史决议，伦敦外长代表会议与对德管制委员会均曾受命讨论德奥问题，并已作了很大和有用的工作，并提出了必要的材料和建议供我们审议。请让我预祝从今天开始的本届会议的成功，现在我们就要处理当前的业务了”。
    英外相贝文继起发言，他代表英代表团感谢苏联政府的招待，并强调会议当前工作的重要性，他提议莫洛托夫作为会议东道国政府的代表，理应担任第一次会议的主席。法外长比道尔及美国务卿马歇尔均附议，并力述此次外长会议的意义以及会议所承当的工作之重要性。莫洛托夫指出外长会议所有委员均亟欲此次会议能获成功。莫氏接受请他担任第一次会议主席之建议，对与会同僚表示感谢，并希望外长会议应建立轮流当主席的程序之后，外长会议决定若干组织问题，并进行程序的讨论。
    【新华社延安十一日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外长莫洛托夫十日于莫斯科四强外长会议首次在会上发表声明称：“苏联代表愿就议事程序提出一项建议，有如众所周知者，一九四五年十二月莫斯科会议上美、英、苏三国外长曾一致认为中国有在国民政府指导下实现统一奥民主化的必要性，有由民主分子广泛参加中国民主政府一切机构及停止内战的必要性。三国外长又曾更加确认遵守不干涉中国国内事务的政策，美、苏两国外长曾经达成完全的协议，愿将苏、美驻华军队在履行其义务与责任之后，尽可能早日撤退。自莫斯科三国外长会议以来，中国局势尚无改进，因此苏联政府提议，外长会议听取莫斯科会议关于中国问题之协定的参加者作关于会议协定实施情形的报告”。莫洛托夫在说明苏联代表团提案时提醒道：“中国问题曾在一九四五年十二月美、英、苏三外长会议上加以讨论，并通过决定。苏代表团提议在本次外长会议听取关于莫斯科会议所通过中国问题决定的实施情形的报告。在一九四五年十二月讨论此问题时，是从参加会议之一定国家的观点出发的。大家都知道，当时会议上中国代表未参加，当时各位外长相信他们当时所通过的决定无须中国代表出席，那次会议直接关系于与会各国政府的政策；而在现在，会议上所需要者只是报告当时通过之决定实施的情形，在我看来无邀请中国代表参加会议之必要，因为该代表未参与一九四五年十二月所通过的协定之制订。在此，苏联政府的提议如下：听取上次莫斯科会议参加者关于该会议有关中国问题之决定的实施情形的报告，苏联代表团不反对在各方均便利之时在外长会议的一次会议上，额外的考虑并讨论此问题”。美首席代表马歇尔于发言时，同意在莫斯科外长会议上讨论此问题，但要求给予时间，以考虑检讨此问题的程序。会议与会者同意展期十一日的下次会议中，考虑苏代表团此项提议。
