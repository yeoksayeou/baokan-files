Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 8th: After the Nanjing Liaison Office of the Chinese Communist Party received the order from the Kuomintang "Capital Garrison Headquarters" on February 28th to forcibly withdraw, it was immediately subjected to close surveillance by Kuomintang secret agents. The agents' actions were so brazen and shameless that they can be described as having reached their limit, fully demonstrating Chiang Kai-shek's determination to break the decade-long relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and finally close the door to peaceful negotiations. The residences of the Nanjing Delegation of the Chinese Communist Party at 17 and 30 Meiyuan New Village were heavily surrounded by secret agents; most of the houses next to these numbers were secret service agencies and disguised agent residences. However, in the past, they used more covert methods. After February 8th, the agents' actions intensified. The Nanjing Garrison Headquarters and the Police Department strictly ordered their affiliated agents to tail all personnel entering and leaving the CCP Liaison Office, and threatening phone calls were made every day. There were often seven or eight cars, eight or nine motorcycles, and thirty or forty agents parked outside the CCP Liaison Office. Whenever someone left the Liaison Office by car, a car would follow. For example, if there were three people in the CCP's car, the agents would follow with three cars. Xinhua News Agency's telegraphic drafts have been forbidden from being sent to various subscribers, and reporters visiting have been interrogated every time. Several reporters have even been taken to the temporary secret service command post set up in Tonglan Lane for questioning. On February 2nd, when Mr. Wang Bingnan visited Stuart, the agent's car even drove into the front yard of the U.S. Embassy to monitor; when Wang visited Shao Lizi, the agents even went inside and sat in the living room. On the 5th, when the Liaison Office hosted a farewell banquet for foreign journalists at the Da Jicheng Restaurant in Nanjing, there were more than twenty agents, equal in number to the hosts and guests, lingering outside the room and shouting loudly. The agents monitoring around Meiyuan carefully inspected the garbage poured out of the rooms every day. On the 4th and 5th, secret agents went to the Xinhua Daily's office on Zhongshan Road in Nanjing to snatch books and instigated hooligans to smash the doors and windows with stones. The Nanjing-based fascist "National Salvation Daily" frequently sent people to forcibly tear off the Xinhua Daily pasted on the newspaper columns and paste the extremely reactionary "National Salvation Daily." When the Liaison Office personnel left Nanjing in batches on the 2nd and 7th to return to Yan'an, each car was escorted by a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's agents, and personnel and luggage were unreasonably searched. Xinhua News Agency's radio was confiscated under the pretext of "contraband." Dozens of Chinese journalists who went to the airport on the 7th to see them off were also forced to register their names, addresses, and newspaper names at the airport entrance. It is reported that news reporters and social figures who often went to Meiyuan for interviews on official business have been put on a blacklist and are prepared to be arrested in the near future.

    【新华社延安八日电】南京中共联络处于上月二十八日接获国民党“首都卫戍司令部”强迫撤退命令后，即遭国民党特务严密监视，特务们行动之放肆与无耻，可谓已达于极点，充分表示蒋介石决心破裂十年来国共关系，最后关闭和平谈判之门。南京中共代表团所在地梅园新村十七号及三十号，原后特务重重包围之中；紧靠这两号房子，大部是特务机关和化妆的特务住所。不过过去还比较用隐蔽方法，二月八日以后，特务行动即变本加厉；南京卫戍司令部与警察厅严令所属特务，对中共联络处进出人员一律盯梢，且每日皆有恐吓电话打来，中共联络处门外经常有汽车七八辆、机器脚踏车八九辆及特务三四十人停留门前，每逢有人自联络处乘车外出，即有汽车跟随。如中共车中有三人，特务即跟上三辆车挠。新华社电讯稿已被禁止外送至各定户，来访之各报记者每次必被盘诘，有数记者且曾被带至僮岚里临时设立的特务指挥所盘问。上月二日，王炳南氏访问司徒雷登时，特务车挠也开进美大使馆前院监视；王访问邵力子时，特务竟一同进内，并同坐客厅。五日，联络处在京市大集成餐室宴别外籍记者时，即有与主客相等之特务二十余名在房厅外徘徊，且高声叫嚣。在梅园周围监视之特务，每日非常小心地检查房内倾出之垃圾。南京中山路新华日报办事处四、五两日有特务至门市部抢书，并唆使流氓以石头猛砸门窗。南京宣扬法西斯的《救国日报》则经常派人强迫将贴报栏之新华日报撕去，而贴上极端反动的《救国日报》。联络处人员二日及七日分批离京返延之时，每一汽车前后均有大批蒋记特务乘车押送，人员行李皆遭无理搜查，新华社之收音机被借口“违禁品”加以没收。七日至机场送别之中国记者数十人，在机场进口处亦被强迫登记姓名、住址及报馆名称。据悉：一向因公常到梅园采访之新闻记者与社会人士，均已被开入黑名单，准备在最近期内加以逮捕云。
