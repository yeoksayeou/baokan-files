    Formulate Concrete Measures to Solve Spring Plowing Difficulties
    [Reported by this newspaper] With spring plowing just around the corner, the Xingtai City Committee, Relief Association, and Municipal Government are now taking joint action to actively find ways to solve the production difficulties of the newly emancipated farmers in the villages outside the city. Over 2,600 peasant households in the villages outside the city have been allocated an average of 1.5 mu of good land per person, as well as necessary farm tools and production funds, through the great emancipation movement last winter. However, due to a complete lack of savings, they still feel a shortage of livestock, waterwheels, and fertilizer for production, and there is no solution for topdressing fertilizer for wheat fields. In response to this, specific solutions have been formulated. Regarding the fertilizer issue: it has been decided to collect all the manure and urine accumulated in hotels, shops, and residential houses in the city, as well as street soil and garbage from streets and wasteland, to solve the problem of topdressing fertilizer for wheat fields throughout the city (estimated at 10 to 15 dan per mu), which will be more than sufficient. In addition to the municipal government launching a city-wide clean-up campaign, mobilizing citizens to thoroughly remove all manure, soil, and garbage, the City Relief Association is also organizing peasants in the villages outside the city to implement mutual assistance in topdressing fertilizer, transporting manure and garbage cleared from the city to the wheat fields. Livestock issue: According to the situation outside Xiguan Pavilion, there is still a shortage of one-third to one-half of the livestock. If several families buy one together, it would not be a problem, but the forage is too expensive to afford. The solution is to organize sideline production, cultivating land while taking time to grind flour, make tofu, haul coal, and transport goods. Waterwheel issue: It has been decided to organize households with waterwheels to help those without, using labor to compensate for the use of waterwheels, and appropriately supplement some waterwheel repair costs. This can increase the irrigated area by one-third. In addition, there are plans to jointly build the Niuwei River water conservancy project north of the city with Xingtai County, turning all the cultivated land outside Beiguan into paddy fields.

　　邢市各领导机关
    订出具体办法解决春耕困难
    【本报讯】春耕在即，邢台市委会，救联会及市政府，现正采用联合行动，积极设法来解决本市城外乡村新翻身农民的生产困难。本市城外各村两千六百余户农民，经过去冬大翻身运动，每人平均都分到好地一亩半，以及必要的农具和生产资金。但因毫无积蓄，在生产上仍感到牲口、水车和肥料不足，麦地追肥尚毫无着落。据此，特定出具体解决办法。关于肥料问题：决定将市内各旅店、商号、民宅所积存的粪尿及牲口粪，各街道、废地上的街土、垃圾全部收集起来，解决全市麦地追肥（每亩以十担至十五担计），足足有余。除由市府发起一次全市清洁卫生运动，发动市民将所有粪土垃圾彻底清除外，市救联合会更组织城外乡村农民，实行追肥互助，将城内清出的粪尿垃圾，运到麦地里去。牲口问题：据西关阁外情况，现在牲口还缺少三分之一到一半，如果几家伙买一个，倒不成问题，就是草料太贵，买起喂不起。解决的办法是组织副业生产，一面种地，一面抽空磨面、磨豆腐、拉煤，运货。水车问题：决定组织有水车户与无车户互助，以劳力补水车工，并酌量添补一部分水车修理费，这样可增加三分之一的浇水面积。另外，计划与邢台县联合兴修城北牛尾河水利，将北关外耕地全部变成水田。
