    Yubei Troops' Cultural Life is Active
    Clapper Talk is Widely Popular
    [This Newspaper's dispatch] Comrade Ren Dawei reports from the Yubei Front: Currently, the cultural life of the Yubei troops is very active. Reciting clapper talk, reading letters from home, writing articles, painting, singing, and watching operas have become indispensable parts of the soldiers' lives. The Frontline Political Department's Vanguard Theater Troupe performs in rotation during breaks in battles, performing soldiers' dramas such as "Liu Shunqing," "Military-Civilian Mutual Assistance," and "Miao Qiunian's Cannon Squad." The latter is a Yangge plaza drama created by the troupe about the unit itself. The scenery and performance are very combat-oriented. When "Miao Qiunian's Cannon Squad" was performed for the "Hanyang" unit, all the soldiers of the small cannon squad were invited to introduce themselves and be photographed. Soldier Wang Fuxi said, "Squad Leader Miao sacrificed himself, but I can still see him in the play, I am very happy!" Dong Jinbao jumped up when he heard that his squad was in the play and said, "I'm not sick anymore, I'm going back to the squad!" Guo Guizi, who was transferred to the first squad, saw that he was in the play and asked the small cannon squad, "Do you want me back?" New soldier Zhang Wendong said to the squad leader during the photo, "I joined a glorious squad right away, I guarantee I won't fall behind." Comrades from the "Fujian" unit praised their performance after watching the play for having three major characteristics: 1. Performing during the day, two shows a day, which is economical and combat-oriented, and will not affect the next day's training because of staying up late to watch the play. 2. It can be seen from three sides, and more people can hear it. 3. People wait for the play, the play does not wait for people.
    Clapper talk has become the most widely loved and popular form of cultural activity among soldiers. It not only enlivens the company's life, but also improves the soldiers' cultural level. The "Hanyang" team produced a large number of excellent clapper talk works during the scabies treatment and training campaign. Their ability to create is amazing. One sentence from you, one sentence from him, and seven or eight拼凑 (pīn còu) make a complete thing. And the content of these clapper talks is closely related to the tasks of each period. Some are praising achievements in work, some are praising the deeds of heroes and models, and some are praising the glue-like internal unity and military-civilian unity, and some are criticizing bad tendencies. It is not only spread by word of mouth, but also seen on walls and door panels.
    Reading letters from home has also become one of the soldiers' cultural activities. When a soldier is reading a letter just sent from his home, and reads about the distribution of the fruits of liberation, everyone applauds warmly. They all understand that the war being waged today is a patriotic war of self-defense, closely linked to their own interests. Letters from home about gaining the fruits of struggle will further encourage soldiers to bravely kill the enemy and defend the fruits of liberation.
    The company newsletters of a certain regiment received 1,774 submissions from soldiers during the four-day intensive training. The "Forward Newspaper" run by Qin Qizhong, the company clerk Qiao Yongxiu, has been published to the tenth issue, and the "Forward Pictorial" has also been published for two issues. He participated in the entire process of running the newspaper, from interviewing and editing to copying, all of which were done by himself. His method of interviewing is to follow the soldiers to train together, watching and writing, and the soldiers are particularly energetic when they see him. Everyone wants to be in the newspaper. As soon as the newspaper is printed, they rush to see if their name is on it, and they discuss the matters in the newspaper.

    豫北部队文化生活活跃
    快板广泛流行
    【本报讯】豫北前线任大卫同志报导：目前豫北部队文化生活甚形活跃。朗诵快板、读家信、写稿、画画、唱歌、看戏等，已成为战士生活中不可缺少的一部分。前线政治部先锋剧团在战役间隙轮回公演，演的都是战士剧，有《刘顺清》、《军民互助》、《苗秋年小炮班》等，后者是该团创作的本部队的秧歌广场剧，布景及演出都很战斗化。当“苗秋年小炮班”在“汉阳”部队演出时，并请小炮班全体战士本人出来介绍及摄影。战士王富喜说：“苗班长牺牲了，我在戏上还能见到他，真高兴！”董金保听到他班上了戏，高兴得跳起来说：“我没病了，回班去！”调到一班的郭贵子见戏中有他，向小炮班说：“我回去你们要不要？”新战士张文东在照像时对班长说：“一来就到光荣班，我保证不落后。”“福建”部队的同志看完戏赞扬他们演出有三大特点：一、白天演出，一天两场，既节约，又战斗化，不会因为晚上看戏睡迟了影响第二天练兵。二、可以三面看，人多些都能听见。三、人不等戏，戏等人。
    快板成为战士文化活动中最广泛喜爱流行的一种形式。它不仅活跃了连队生活，而且也提高了战士的文化程度。“汉阳”队在治疥与练兵运动中，产生了大批优秀的快板作品，他们创造的能力是惊人的，你一句，他一句，七拚八凑就成了一个完整的东西。而这些快板的内容，又都是密切结合每一时期的任务，有的是歌颂工作中的成绩，有的是歌颂英雄与模范的事迹，还有的是歌颂胶一样的内部团结与军民团结，也有的批评不良的倾向。不仅流传在口头上，还见之于墙壁上门板上。
    读家信亦成为战士文化生活之一，当某一个战士在朗读他家里刚寄来的信，读到分得翻身果实时，大家就报以热烈的鼓掌。他们都懂得今天进行的战争是爱国自卫战争，与自己的利益密切结合在一起的。家里得到斗争果实的来信，会更鼓舞起战士勇敢杀敌与保卫翻身果实的热情。
    某团的各连队小报在四天大练兵中，接到战士来稿达一千七百七十四件。秦启忠连文书乔永秀办的《前进报》，已出到十期，《前进画报》亦出了两期。他参加了办报的全过程，从采访编辑，到复写，都是由他一手完成。他采访的方法是跟着战士一块练兵，边看边写，战士们见到他，做动作就特别有劲，大家都想上报。报一印出来，就争着看有没有自己的名字，纷纷议论报上事情。
