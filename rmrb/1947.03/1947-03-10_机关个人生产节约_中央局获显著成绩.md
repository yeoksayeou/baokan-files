　　Significant Achievements in Individual Production and Savings by 机关 Personal Production and Savings in the Central Bureau

　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Correspondent Cui Xi reports: Since the Central Bureau's机关 Personal Production launched the individual production and savings campaign, it has achieved significant results. According to preliminary statistics, in February, 109 people saved 7,839 jin of millet, and 46 people contributed 3,200 jin to public tasks. Calculated at an average price of 30 yuan per jin, this has increased the public revenue by 33,107 yuan. Currently, 105 people have set personal plans to engage in production, and 21 spinning wheels are turning non-stop every day. Comrade Gu Tao from the Transportation Section has spun four jin of thread, and Section Chief Li from the Administration Bureau has also spun more than two jin. In particular, Comrade Li Qin, a family member, spins twelve liang of thread a day; she is very busy from morning till night, which is worthy of learning for all family members. Recently, new spinning wheels are constantly being added, indicating that this major mode of production will become increasingly common. The flour milling team of the Organization and Propaganda Departments is also doing a good job. They have not only established preliminary work calculation methods (washing 150 jin of wheat, grinding 50 jin of chaff, and feeding livestock for 10 days each counts as one work unit), but also organized family members to participate. They can now grind nearly 100 jin of wheat per day. The comrades in the Research Office mainly focus on binding books, and have bound 100 commemorative albums for the public. The five comrades from the former Administrative Office are seizing time and using every evening after dinner to carry out continuous contract work, repairing deep ponds, painting houses..., and have now completed one-third of the annual task. Comrade Ma Yushan from the Transportation Section has produced the most, earning 8,600 yuan through carrying stretchers, doing odd jobs, and repairing roads. Next is Comrade Huo Weimin, a nurse from the health clinic. He gets up at dawn to fetch water for nearby shops and also grows bean sprouts, now producing 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Therefore, when submitting tasks recently, Comrade Gu Tao submitted the most, 175 jin of millet, followed by him with 160 jin. In addition, activities such as cutting pig bristles, making shoes, knitting sweaters, and cultural production such as writing books and contributing articles are also underway.

　　In terms of savings: Many people have saved all the subsidies for items such as towels, soap, toothbrushes, and toothpaste, and nearly one-third of the comrades only need a single set of clothing and two or three pairs of shoes. Comrade Pan Shi saved the most, returning all items except for a pair of shoes to the public.

　　On the evening of March 5th, the heads of each production team reported that everyone is now generally mobilized. This is due to Comrade Bo Yibo's call and the personal mobilization of the heads of the机关, which made everyone's production concept of overcoming difficulties, supporting the front lines, and welcoming the light particularly clear. At the same time, the responsible comrades first reduced their living standards and actively responded to the call (such as Minister Nie and Director Ping, who are also engaged in production in their busy schedules and have now completed 50 to 80 jin of tasks), which also promoted everyone's production enthusiasm. However, individual comrades still have not set personal plans, or are still hesitating despite having plans. The merit campaign still needs to be vigorously carried out in order to consolidate and enhance this upsurge. To this end, in addition to lending out 100,000 yuan in loans and purchasing more than 500 jin of cotton, the 机关 cooperative is actively preparing to set up a small textile factory and organize purchasing and selling affairs to ensure that everyone does not lack raw materials or have unsold finished products in handicraft production.

　　机关个人生产节约
    中央局获显著成绩
    【本报特讯】通讯员崔玺报导：中央局机关自开展个人生产节约运动以来，已获较显著成绩。据初步统计，二月份一○九人已节约小米七八三九斤，四十六人交公任务三二○○斤。如按平均价每斤三十元计算，已可使公家增加三三一○七元的收入。现在订出个人计划进入生产的已达一○五人，二十一辆纺车正在每日不停的转动，交通科谷涛同志已纺出四斤线子，管理局李科长也纺够二斤多，特别是家属李勤之同志，更一天纺十二两线子；从早到晚，十分紧张，值得所有家属学习。最近新的车挠仍不断增加，显示这一主要生产方式将日益普遍。组、宣两部的磨面组合也搞的很好，他们不但订出初步的计工办法（淘麦子一五○斤，磨稃五○斤喂牲口十天各算一个工），而且把家属也组织在内，现已能每日磨麦近一百斤左右。研究室同志主要是订精装书，已给公家订出一百本纪念册。时间抓的比较紧的有原行政处的五个同志，利用每晚饭后进行连续包工，修深塘、刷房子………，现已完成全年任务三分之一。生产最多的是交通科马玉山同志，他靠抬担架、打短工修路等办法，已完成八千六百元的收入。其次是卫生所看护霍卫民同志，他是天一亮就起来给附近商店挑水，附带还生豆芽，现也生产五六千元，因之最近交任务时除谷涛同志交一七五斤小米最多外，他也交了一六○斤。此外剪猪毛、做鞋子、打毛衣以及文化生产如编书、投稿等等也正在进行。
    节约方面：毛巾、肥皂、牙刷、牙粉等补助部分，很多人全部节约了，近三分之一的同志只要一身单衣、两三双鞋子。最多是磐石同志除一双鞋外，全部节约归公。
    三月五日晚，各生产组长汇报，都觉得现在是普遍的动起来了。这是由于薄一波同志的号召、机关首长们的亲自动员，使大家克服困难支援前线迎接光明的生产观念特别明确，同时各负责同志首先降低生活水平，积极响应号召（如聂部长、平局长也在百忙中生产，现已完成五十斤到八十斤的任务），也推动了大家的生产热忱。但个别同志仍有没订好个人计划，或虽有计划仍在犹豫。立功运动也尚需大力开展，以便巩固并提高这个热潮。为此机关合作社最近除了已借出十万元贷款，并代购五百余斤棉花外，正积极筹办小型纺织工厂，及组织代购代销事宜，以保证大家在手工业生产中不缺原料，不存成品。
