(Jinan News, Hebei, 17th) When Chiang's troops fled south from Daming, they abducted over a thousand peaceful residents. Upon reaching the outskirts of Anyang, they spread rumors, saying, "The Eighth Route Army has killed all your family members, and Daming City has been razed to the ground. Don't go back!" As a result, some were forced into military service, while the rest were left in Yiannian Village, northeast of Anyang City, without food or lodging, suffering immensely. On the 23rd of last month, six people had already escaped back to the South Gate.

(Jinan News, Hebei, 15th) After our army recovered Daming, reporters visited the Zhangnan area of Wei County, which had been brutally trampled by Chiang's troops. In every village where Chiang's troops had stayed, the trees were sawn off halfway up, and watchtowers stood everywhere. No one could hear the sounds of pigs or chickens. A farmer from Houwenyi Village said, "My quilts, clothes, grain, chickens, and sheep were all looted by Chiang's troops. I had to work for them on an empty stomach, and if they weren't happy, they would beat me severely." In Dading Village, in the Third District, 300 *shi* of grain, eight head of livestock, and countless clothes and belongings were looted. More than ten members of the farmers' association were beaten to the point of being unable to move. The "Homecoming Corps" committed atrocities in the village, demanding money at will. A middle peasant's fields were robbed of 20 *shi* of grain and one head of cattle, and all the belongings in his house were looted. His family of twenty was left with only two *dou* of grain. The captain of the "Homecoming Corps," Guan Zongming, buried over eighty people alive behind the Dazhai Temple in the village. Over fifty corpses have been exhumed, and some corpses remain unclaimed, while others cannot find the bodies of their loved ones. Many "body-seekers" are shedding tears of disappointment, their hearts ablaze with the fire of revenge. They are all planning that this blood debt must be repaid by the Chiang bandits.

　　蒋军自大名南窜时抓走千余和平居民
    【本报冀南十七日电】蒋军自大名逃窜时，抓走千余和平居民，到安阳城郊，造谣说：“八路军把你们家里人都杀净了，大名城已经炸平了，千万别回去。”结果一部被迫当兵，其他都在安阳城东北延年庄，食宿无着，痛苦万分。上月二十三日，南关已有六名逃回。
    【本报冀南十五日电】我军收复大名后，记者曾访问惨遭蒋军残踏的魏县漳南地区，凡是蒋军住过的村庄，树木都从半腰锯光，满村矗立着岗楼，谁家也听不见猪叫鸡飞了。后文义村一个农民说：“我家被子、衣服、粮食、鸡、羊部被蒋军抢光了，饿着肚子还得给他们作工，一不合他们的意，就要毒打。”三区大丁屯村被抢走粮食三百石、牲口八头、衣服东西无法统计，农会员挨打不能动的有十余人。“还乡团”在村中任意作恶要钱，中农田被抢走粮食二十石，牛一头，家中东西全被抢光，全家二十口人只剩下二斗谷子。“还乡团”的队长关宗铭，在村庄集大庙后活埋了八十多个群众，已有五十多具死体起走，还有些死体无人找认，有的则找不着自己人的死体，很多“找尸”的人都流着失望的眼泪，心里燃起复仇的热火，他们都在计划着，这笔血账一定要蒋贼偿还。
