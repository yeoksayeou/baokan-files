    "Prescribing the Right Medicine" for Patient Mobilization:
    Using Original Tunes to Activate Honest Farmers
    [Report from Shexian by our newspaper] After the initial adjustment of the relationship between cadres and the masses in Yuanqu Village, Fifth District, efforts were further intensified to mobilize honest farmers. First, a forum was held with over 150 people (including 30 women) to encourage everyone to speak truthfully, and many more problems were discovered. Huang Qiming said, "We poor and hired peasants are the masters, but there are still many in the village who have not been mobilized. I know that in my street alone, there are still 53 people, including Zhang Zhegen and Wu Guishun, who don't talk much, don't attend winter school, and don't come to meetings." Zhang Nanfang said, "Speaking of this, there are many more in our village." As a result, everyone realized that there were still many honest people who had not been mobilized. All 130 cadres, both old and new activists in the village, organized a work brigade to go deep into the people's schools to mobilize them. After the meeting, cadres and activists mobilized door-to-door, and the number of people in the four people's schools in the village slowly increased from 480 to 630. In the process of mobilization, there were also many twists and turns. Some "artillery" activists adopted simple methods, not investigating the reasons for backwardness and forcing people to get involved. For example, Yue Chengyu mobilized Wu Dezong by simply saying: "Raise whatever you have to say at the people's school." Shen Qingxian mobilized an honest farmer by saying: "Don't you have no irrigated land? Raise an opinion at the people's school, and you might get a share of land." Some were patient in their mobilization, but failed to resolve ideological problems. For example, when a public security officer mobilized old man Cui Mingchang, he also adopted a casual chatting approach. Cui Mingchang raised the issue: "We don't understand the distribution of fruits of labor. Regardless of good or bad, regardless of the number of people, a good house is one room, and a dilapidated house is also counted as one room." The public security officer didn't know what to say next, so he started rambling. There were also some who had a purely task-oriented view, lacking patience and trying to force ideas into the minds of the masses. For example, Pei Dongcheng talked to six or seven groups (about 100 people) in half a day. His method was a question-and-answer format: "Why does the land belong to the families?" "Shouldn't it belong to the landlords?" "Why are we the masters of society?" Everyone just stared blankly, unable to answer. Some used the method of "prescribing the right medicine" to guide and improve people ideologically. For example, Zhang Zhegen (a poor peasant), a military dependent, was mainly worried about his brother serving in the army far away. Huang Qiming understood his concerns and used a casual chat to talk to him: "Your brother is fighting for us. But the army alone is not enough. We also need to help more from the rear. For example, if you work alone in the field, you have to work until dark. If you have more people, won't he be able to come back sooner?" "If you put it that way, our rear work is a major thing! I used to be unhappy when military dependents were called upon to perform tasks. In the future, I will be happy to do more tasks than others, so that my brother can come back sooner when we defeat old Chiang." As a result, Zhang Zhegen automatically went to the people's school and mobilized Zhang Gen, Qin Sinu, and others to attend the people's school as well.
    After studying the above methods, everyone unanimously recognized that mobilizing the backward is a matter of patience, and Huang Qiming's "prescribing the right medicine" method is the best. According to statistics, in a short period of seven days, a total of 180 honest farmers were mobilized, and 142 male and 76 female activists emerged. There are still some people in the village who have not been mobilized. After discussion, everyone decided that each old activist would guarantee to mobilize two more people, and each new activist would mobilize one, and launched a further in-depth movement to mobilize honest farmers.

    “对症下药”耐心动员
    原曲发动老实农民
    【本报涉县讯】五区原曲村在初步调整干群关系之后，又进一步深入发动老实农民，首先召开了百五十余人（妇女三十人）的座谈会，启发大家说老实话，又发现许多问题。黄起名说：“咱们贫雇是主人，但村里还有好多没有发动起来，我知道的俺一街就还有张折根、吴桂顺等五十三个不大说话的人，冬学也不上，开会也不到。”张南芳说：“你说起这来吧，咱村还多着哩，这一来大家认识了还有很多老实人未发动，全村干部新老积极分子一百卅人组织了一个工作大队，在民校深入发动。会后干部积极分子挨门逐户动员，全村四处民校慢慢的由四百八十个人增到六百三十人。在发动过程中也经过不少曲折，个别“炮手”积极分子，采取简单方法，不追究落后原因硬往起搞，如岳成玉动员吴得仲只简单说：有啥到民校提吧。申清先动员一个老实农民说：你不是没有水地？到民校提个意见，还不弄它三分园地。还有些在发动中，也耐心，但不能解决思想问题。如公安员在动员老汉崔明昌时，也是采取了闲拉闲扯的方式，崔明昌提出问题说：果实分配咱就不明白，不分好坏，不分人多少，好房也是一间，窟窿房子也是一间顶一间。公安员不知往下再说什么，就乱扯开了。还有个别的是单纯的任务观点，不耐心、硬往群众脑筋灌。如裴东成三个人半天就拉扯谈了六七伙，（约一百人）他的方式是一问一答“为啥土地归家？”“还是地主该的咱哩吧！”“为啥咱是社会主人？”大家都瞪着眼答不来了。有些用对症下药的方法，从思想上诱导提高，如军属张着根（贫农）主要的是因兄弟参军在外，每天在家挂念，黄起名了解了他的心思，便利用闲拉扯的方式给他谈：“你兄弟是给咱们打仗的，光军队也不行，还得咱在后方多帮助。比如咱在地里一个人做活，要搭黑，多用几个人他不是就能早些回来。”“照你这样说吧，咱后方工作还是一个大事哩！以前叫军属支差，我心就不高兴，以后我比旁人多出些差心里也乐意，早打败老蒋我兄弟也能早些回来。”这一来张着根便自动的上了民校，并动员张根、秦四女等也都上了民校。
    以上几种办法，经大家研究后，一致的认识了动员落后是个耐心事，黄起名“对症下药”办法最好，在短短的七天当中据统计，共发动起一百八十个老实农民，出现了积极分子男人一百四十二人，妇女七十六个。现在全村仍有一部分没发动。大家讨论决定，老积极分子每人再保证发动两个，新积极分子每人一个，开展了再深入一步的发动老实农民运动。（原曲通讯小组）
