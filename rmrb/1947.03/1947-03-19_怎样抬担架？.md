　　In the great patriotic self-defense war, the emancipated peasants of our various regions have enthusiastically rushed to the self-defense battlefield, undertaking various war service tasks, many of whom are participating in stretcher teams. As for how to carry a stretcher, we should know this in order to reduce the suffering of our brave wounded soldiers. So, how can we carry it to make the injured comrades comfortable and free from pain? Now, I will introduce a few points to pay attention to when carrying a stretcher:

　　(1) How to lift someone with a head injury: If the head is injured, keep his head flat, without a pillow. When carrying him, be steady and calm, do not shout loudly, and place him in a quiet place when resting, and do not let his brain be stimulated by sound vibrations.

　　(2) How to lift someone with chest and back injuries: If the chest or back is injured, use grass or clothes to raise the back, so that the injured comrade can lie diagonally, like lying on a rickshaw. If the back is not raised, his breathing will be difficult.

　　(3) How to lift someone with abdominal injuries: For comrades with stomach injuries, the back should also be raised a little. He must be asked to bend his legs, because if his legs are straightened, it will tighten the abdomen, and the wound will be particularly painful.

　　(4) How to lift someone with limb injuries: If the arm or leg is injured, if the bone is not broken, the injured arm or leg can be raised and placed in a suitable place, without squeezing his injured part, and do not shake when walking.

　　(5) How to lift someone with hip and side injuries: If the hip is injured, lie on your side on the stretcher, or lie prone if that's impossible. If the right side of the body is injured, lie on the left side, and if the left side is injured, lie on the right side. In short, do not press the wound.

　　(6) How to lift someone with bone injuries: Whether it is a broken leg or a broken arm, it is best to use a door panel to lift. Because the place where the bone is broken is extremely painful with slight movement, it must be lifted with a door panel, so that it does not shake when walking, so that the injured comrade suffers less pain.

　　(7) How to lift the wounded onto a stretcher: It only takes four people to lift the wounded onto a stretcher. Two people face each other, holding each other's hands under the wounded's body, two people lift the legs, and two people lift the head. At this time, special attention should be paid to the wounded's wound, and do not press it. There is also a way to lift the wounded person by lying him on a quilt, with four people each holding a corner of the quilt, and lifting him up together with the quilt.

　　(8) Bring a quilt on the stretcher. It is very cold on winter nights and a quilt is needed. On the other hand, injured comrades are afraid of the cold due to bleeding, so more grass (wheat straw is best) should be spread on the stretcher, and the quilt should be well covered to prevent drafts, especially when sending the wounded at night.

　　(9) Do not shake when carrying, it is best to be fast and steady, and send them to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible. The seriously injured go first, and the old and weak stretcher bearers also go first. After crossing the river, wait until everyone is together before leaving, so as not to lag behind, especially at night.

　　(10) Do not talk nonsense in front of the wounded, especially comfort the seriously injured. If some have sacrificed, do not talk or make noise to affect other wounded, and immediately report to the comrade in charge of escorting the stretcher for proper handling.

### 怎样抬担架？

　　怎样抬担架？
    在伟大的爱国自卫战争中，我各地翻身农民，多踊跃奔赴自卫战场，担负各种战勤工作，其中有许多是参加担架队的，至于担架的抬法，我们应该知道，以减少我们英勇负伤将士们的痛苦。那末，怎样抬法才能使受伤的同志舒服不受痛苦呢？现在把抬担架时要注意的几个问题介绍如下：
    （一）头脑受伤的抬法：头脑受伤，要把他的头放平，不要枕头。抬走时，要稳当、镇静，不要大声吵嚷，休息时要放在清静地方，不要使他的脑子受到声音震动的刺激。
    （二）胸背受伤的抬法：胸背受伤，要用草或衣服把背垫高，叫受伤同志斜躺着，象躺在洋车上一样。如果不把背垫高，他的呼吸要受到困难。
    （三）腹部受伤的抬法：肚子受伤的同志，背也要垫高一些，必须叫他把两腿屈起，若两腿伸直，能拉紧肚皮，伤口格外痛。
    （四）四肢受伤的抬法：胳膊和腿受了伤，如果骨头没有断，可把他受伤的胳膊或腿垫高，安放在适当的地方，不要挤压着他的伤部，走起路来也不要摇晃。
    （五）臀部和身侧受伤的抬法：臀部受伤，要侧躺在担架上，不行时可伏卧。身右受伤，可用左身躺着，左面受伤则用右身躺着。总之，不要压迫着伤口。
    （六）骨头受伤的抬法：无论断腿骨折和胳膊骨折，最好用门板抬。因为骨头断了的地方，稍一活动，就疼痛难忍，所以必须用门板抬，走起路来不至摇晃，使受伤同志少受痛苦。
    （七）怎样往担架上抬伤员：往担架上抬伤员，有四个人就行，两个人对面，从伤员身下互相把手握着，二人抬腿、二人抬头，这时应特别注意伤员伤口，不要压着。还有一种抬法，就是把伤员卧在被子上，四个人一人握着一个被角，连被子抬。
    （八）担架上要带被子，冬天晚上很冷需要盖被子，另一方面，受伤的同志，因流血，身上怕冷，所以担架上要多铺草（麦秸最好）被子要盖好，不要透风，特别在黑夜送伤员更要多盖被子。
    （九）抬走时不要晃动，最好又快又稳当，早送到医院去进行治疗。重伤先走，老弱担架员也要先走。过河后要等齐再走，以免拉下距离，尤其黑夜更应注意。
    （十）在伤员面前，不要乱说话，特别对重伤员要多安慰。如有的牺牲了，切不要乱讲乱吵影响其他伤员，要马上报告负责押送担架的同志适当处理。
