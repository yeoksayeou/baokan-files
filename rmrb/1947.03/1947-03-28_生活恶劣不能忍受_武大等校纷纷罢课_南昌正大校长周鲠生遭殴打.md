Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. A dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 24th revealed that in the past two months, Wuhan University and Hubei Teachers College in Wuchang, and Zhongzheng University in Nanchang have successively gone on strike, demanding improved treatment. The lack of educational facilities and the deplorable living conditions of students have reached a point where they can no longer be tolerated. The strike at Wuhan University occurred last month and has been forced to resume classes. The Teachers College and Zhengda University followed Wuhan University in striking, and the issue has not been completely resolved. During the strike, the Chiang Kai-shek appointed president, who refused to improve student treatment, was driven away by students. Zhou Gengsheng, the reactionary and stubborn president of Nanchang Zhengda University, was even beaten by angry students. The Kuomintang Ministry of Education has adopted a high-handed policy of so-called "strict handling" and "no leniency" towards the students' reasonable actions, claiming that the striking students will be "rectified."
