[Taiyue, March 12th (Report from this newspaper)] The Taiyue Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial titled "Playing the Last Move," calling on cadres and activists to promote the noble quality of serving the people, withdraw from cheaply bought and excessively gained fruits of struggle, so that all peasants can achieve liberation. The editorial stated: Returning the fruits of excessively gained and favorably cheap purchases by cadres to the masses is the last move in whether or not the policy of "land to the tiller" can be fully realized. Our region's land reform movement has been relatively successful this time, but we must also play the last move of returning the gains well; if this problem is not resolved satisfactorily, the entire movement will be "undone," and it will be difficult to do it again later. Therefore, whether in areas where land reform has been completed or is nearing completion, a thorough inspection of the distribution of fruits should be carried out universally and in depth to resolve it satisfactorily and take the movement a step further.

　　太岳新华日报社论号召
    干部积极分子发扬自觉退出多得果实实现填补
    【本报太岳十二日电】太岳新华日报顷以“下最后一着棋”为题发表社论，号召干部积极分子发扬为人民服务的崇高品质，退出贱买与多得的斗争果实，使所有农民都能翻身。社论称：把干部多得及好的贱买的果实退给群众，是能否完满实现耕者有其田的最后一着棋。我区此次土地改革运动做得比较完满，但还必须把退果实这最后一着棋走好；这个问题如得不到圆满解决，整个运动便会“功亏一篑”，以后再来作就困难了。因此不论在已经完成或接近完成土地改革的地区，均应普遍深入的进行一次果实分配的检查，将其圆满解决，把运动深入一步。
