    Taihang Second Military Sub-district's Training Experience:
    Combining Training with Combat
    Combining Politics with Technology
    [This newspaper reports] The Taihang Second Military Sub-district convened a staff meeting from the 3rd to the 5th to summarize the training work of last year and January and February of this year, drawing the following experiences: (1) Combining combat and training: After each battle, the Taiyuan Independent Battalion conducted self-criticism from the bottom up, carefully summarizing the experience and lessons learned in the battle, and incorporating them into training, seizing the gaps in combat to conduct repeated actual combat exercises; the troops' combat effectiveness was rapidly improved, creating brilliant achievements of four wins out of four and zero losses versus 136. (2) Combining politics and technology: enabling every commander and fighter to have high awareness and skill. The Yangquan Independent Battalion has used this to create model combat achievements and has been commended and rewarded several times. (3) Specific leadership by leaders: The achievements of the Second Military Sub-district in training under combat conditions last year were due to the specific leadership of the sub-district leaders. In order to complete this year's training tasks, the meeting formulated a training plan for the first half of the year based on the different situations of each unit. Chief of Staff Du emphasized that all units should quickly launch mass training movements. Director Leng called on all units to improve their skills, and everyone should make contributions to training. All the comrades and staff members directly under the division who attended the meeting were in high spirits and held rifle, light machine gun live ammunition shooting and live ammunition throwing after the meeting, with excellent results.

    训练与战斗结合
    政治与技术结合
    【本报讯】太行二分区于三日至五日召开参谋会议，总结去年与今年一、二月份练兵工作，得出几点经验：（一）作战与训练结合：太谷独立营每次战斗后，自下而上的进行检讨，认真总结战斗中的经验教训，并贯注于训练中，抓紧战斗空隙即进行反复的实战演习；部队战斗力得以迅速提高，创造了四比四捷及零比一三六的辉煌战绩。（二）政治与技术结合：使每个指战员均有高度自觉与技术。阳独立营曾以此要创模范战绩，受到几次的表扬嘉奖。（三）首长具体领导：去年二分区部队练兵能在战斗情况下取得成绩，有赖于分区首长的具体领导。为完成今年的练兵任务，会议根据各个部队的不同情况，拟定上半年训练计划。杜参谋长着重指出：各部队应迅速开展群众性的练兵运动。冷主任号召各部队把技术提高一步，人人在练兵上立功。到会各同志及分直参谋人员情绪饱满，于会后举行步枪、轻机枪质弹射击及实弹投掷，成绩甚佳。
