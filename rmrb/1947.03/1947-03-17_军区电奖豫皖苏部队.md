　　Military Region Commends Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Troops
    [This newspaper's special dispatch] The Military Region recently sent a telegram to commend the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu troops, which reads: "Since the beginning of this year, your region's continuous victories and rapid development have shaken the heart of the Chiang army. The Chiang army was forced to use more than seven brigades of heavy troops to "sweep" and "suppress" you. In the past month, you have waged a heroic and arduous anti-sweeping struggle, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, and attacked Xia邑 East Pass and Huaiyang North Pass, recovering Zhecheng and Suixian, and twice attacking Taikang, gloriously defending this land belonging to the people, containing a large number of Chiang's troops, and playing a significant coordinating role in the overall war situation. A telegram of commendation is hereby sent, and it is hoped that all the soldiers and civilians will be encouraged to continue their efforts, persevere, and usher in new victories!"

　　军区电奖豫皖苏部队
    【本报特讯】军区顷致电嘉奖豫皖苏部队，略称：“今年以来，你区的连续胜利与猛烈发展，已经震撼了蒋军的心脏，蒋军被迫以七个旅以上的重兵，向你们“扫荡”、“清剿”。一个月以来，你们以艰苦卓绝的反扫荡斗争，予敌人以重大杀伤，并袭入夏邑东关、淮阳北关，收复柘城、睢县，两度攻入太康，光荣地坚持了这块属于人民的土地，牵制了大量蒋军，对全面战局起了重大的配合作用，特电嘉勉，并望鼓励全体军民，再接再厉，坚持下去，迎接新的胜利！”
