　　Local Armed Forces of the Seventh Military Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    Protect the Masses in Land Distribution
    Active in the Suburbs of Jining
    [Reported by our newspaper from Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 28th] Our local armed guerrilla forces in the Seventh Military Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan are active in the suburbs of Jining. They are both carrying out land distribution and attacking the enemy and puppets. In the four days from February 8th to 11th, they annihilated more than 60 enemies. On the 8th, our guerrilla forces were enthusiastically mobilizing the masses to distribute land near Weilang and Shanmiaoxian near Jining, when suddenly more than 70 enemy and puppet troops rushed to seize grain. After our guerrilla forces counterattacked, the enemy and puppets fled in all directions, and the masses' enthusiasm for land distribution was even higher. On the 10th, our local armed forces went deep into the Yangzhuang and Mazhuang areas, five li away from the suburbs of Jining, and captured two people, including the secretary of the puppet district of Nanpo. At 3 p.m. on the same day, more than 1,000 enemy and puppet troops launched sneak attacks on Madi and Yangzhuang in separate groups. After our counterattack, and after half an hour of fierce fighting, we killed more than 10 enemy soldiers and wounded more than 30. We only suffered one serious injury, creating a brilliant victory of fifty to one. On the 11th, our local armed forces, in coordination with local militia, protected the masses in distributing land in Jia Zhuang, 15 li east of Jining city, and defeated more than 100 enemy and puppet troops who were attacking and harassing, capturing two enemy platoon leaders and killing one.
    [Reported by our newspaper from Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 26th] In January, the local armed forces and other troops of the Tenth Military Sub-district's Corps displayed a high degree of initiative and successfully completed the glorious task of killing the enemy assigned by the military region, some even exceeding the task. Among them, the troops of the Fifth Military Sub-district and the ×× Regiment of the Seventh Military Sub-district were particularly outstanding. In January, a total of 72 battles, large and small, were fought, killing and capturing more than 1,600 stubborn puppet troops, seizing 24 light machine guns, 116 rifles and carbines, 59 pistols, and many other spoils of war.
