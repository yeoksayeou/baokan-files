    Taiyue Shizhenming Mutual Aid Brigade Mobilizes Women to Learn to Handle Plows and Harrows
    [This newspaper Taiyue twenty-fifth dispatch] Taiyue Qin Yuan, Yangcheng, Jincheng, Gaoping, Shimin, Qinshui and other counties' liberated peasants are enthusiastically preparing for large-scale spring plowing. The Shizhenming Joint Mutual Aid Team proposed that not only should the organizational form be emphasized, but also ideological education, so as to consolidate the mutual aid groups. It is estimated that the war will be very frequent this year, and various places are rectifying mutual aid, paying attention to the combination of war service and production. Many mutual aid groups have become long-term combined forms. The Shizhenming Joint Mutual Aid Team has organized a "Standing Stretcher Team," unified work points and service points, and is preparing for long-term production and long-term support for the front. The Dayang Town Mutual Aid Group in Jincheng discussed 42 measures to combine production and war service, ensuring that production and support for the front are not affected under any circumstances. Because full labor force frequently participates in the war, all localities are required to organize 100% of the full and semi-labor force and animal power, especially organizing women to participate in major labor. Dayang Town in Jincheng leads women to participate in production mutual aid, and during the busy farming season, the textile group is transformed into an agricultural labor mutual aid group. The Shizhenming Joint Mutual Aid Team mobilized women to learn how to handle plows and harrows, upgrading them from semi-labor to full labor. Thirty young women in the Yuantou Village Brigade have already learned how to plow the land. The above-mentioned counties are restoring and newly establishing mule and horse fairs to regulate plowing animals and farm implements. At the mule and horse fairs in Wangbi in Shimin and Dongguan in Yangcheng, hoes, plows, plowshares, manure forks, looms, spinning wheels, and farming cattle are selling well, which is unprecedented in history. Shops and tax and trade bureaus in Gaoping and Jincheng are selling livestock without profit to help the masses solve their difficulties. Village cooperatives are also issuing spring loans with profits. At present, most villages are delivering manure, transporting coal, chopping firewood, and building stoves. It is estimated that a large-scale spring plowing campaign will begin in the entire area in early April.

    太岳石振明互助大队动员妇女学掌犁耙
    【本报太岳二十五日电】太岳沁源、阳城、晋城、高平、士敏、沁水等县翻身农民，兴致勃勃的准备大规模的春耕。石振明联合互助队提出不仅要重视组织形式，而且要重视思想教育，使互助组巩固下去。估计今年战争非常频繁，各地整顿互助注意战勤与生产结合，许多互助组已变成长年结合的形式。石振明联合互助队中便组织着“常备担架队”，统一工票与差票，准备长期生产，长期支援前线。晋城大阳镇互助组讨论出四十二条生产与战勤结合办法，在任何情况下皆不能影响生产与支援前线。由于全劳力经常参战，要求各地百分之百的将全半劳力及畜力组织起来，特别是组织妇女参加主要劳动。晋城大阳镇领导妇女参加生产互助，在农忙时将纺织组转为农业劳动互助组。石振明联合互助队动员妇女学习掌犁耙，由半劳力上升为全劳力。垣头村大队三十个青年妇女已学习犁地。上述各县正恢复与新设骡马大会，调剂耕畜与农具，士敏之王壁、阳城之东关等骡马大会上，锄头、犁耙、犁铧、粪叉、织机、纺车及耕牛销路畅旺，为历史上所未有。高平晋城各商店及税务贸易局皆无利贩卖牲畜，帮助群众解决困难。各村合作社亦以盈利发放春贷。目前大部分村庄正在送粪、运煤、打柴、垒灶，估计全区大规模的春耕运动在四月初即可展开。
