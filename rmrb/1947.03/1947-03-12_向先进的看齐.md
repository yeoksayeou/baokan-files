　　Learning from the Advanced
    News of the personal production movement in government agencies is constantly being published in newspapers, and many agencies have achieved great results. However, a few agencies are still not energetic enough or effective enough. The production and frugality movement is a major task for rear area agencies this year, and it cannot be allowed to drift. Those who have not done well must work hard and learn from the advanced. According to materials from the Central Administration Bureau, the General Branch Committee, and other sources, to run agency production well, the following issues must be properly resolved:
    First, a sound leadership structure. In places that are doing well, the responsible comrades of the agency are generally leading in person, and the production team leaders are also properly selected. At the same time, the leadership method is based on organizing and inspiring based on the opinions of the masses, forming a mass upsurge, rather than the leadership coming up with a set of methods and forcing the masses to implement them. If the responsible comrades of the agency do not care and delegate it to secondary personnel to lead, or are leaders in name only and are not actually responsible, and there is no group of leading core members, or if a simple administrative order is used instead of taking the mass line, it will not be done well. Second, personal production plans and regular inspections to solve difficult problems at any time. The plan is a specific goal to strive for. Only with a self-determined goal can there be enthusiasm for struggle. With regular inspections, the movement can continue to develop to a higher stage; otherwise, the enthusiasm that is aroused for a time will become slack and then decline. Third, taking both public and private interests into consideration. It is best if individuals can handle everything beyond what is required by the task. Helping individuals establish their families can stimulate production enthusiasm and is also beneficial to work and study. Fourth, launch a meritorious service movement. It is best to conduct monthly democratic inspections based on individual plans, evaluate and record merits, and commend and reward comrades who have achieved results, have creativity, and can help others.
    A few comrades still have a "wait-and-see" mentality. Some are waiting for a production "trick" that requires little effort but yields great profits. These people are mainly afraid of hardship, afraid of trouble, and cannot let go of their airs. They need to learn from Chairman Yang's delivery of manure and Minister Nie's growing of bean sprouts. Some are waiting for the counter-offensive and victory before entering the city. These people are mainly suffering from the harm of underestimating the enemy and the thought of quick victory. They should see that before we achieve victory, there is still a long and arduous journey ahead. In the current tense and arduous struggle, everyone should share in its glorious part. The experience of the Border Region Government proves that agency production has a great impact on the nearby masses after it is launched. Therefore, in order to promote the large-scale production movement in the Border Region this year, we should also do a better job in agency production.

### 向先进的看齐

　　向先进的看齐
    机关个人生产运动的消息，不断在报上发表，许多机关获得很大成绩。但也有少数机关还不够有劲，不够得法。生产节约运动今年是后方机关的一个大任务，决不能任其自流。还没有做得很好的，必须发奋努力，向先进的看齐。据中管局及总支委材料及其他材料，把机关生产办好，要确当解决下述几个问题：
    第一、健全的领导机构。凡办得好的地方，大概都是机关负责同志亲自领导，生产组长也推选的得当。同时在领导方法上是根据群众的意见加以组织和启发，形成群众性的热潮，而不是领导上想出一套办法，硬要群众去执行。凡机关负责同志不管而委之与次要人员去领导，或挂名领导实际不负责，又没有一批领导骨干，或不采取群众路线而用单纯行政命令，都办不好。第二、个人生产计划与经常检查，随时解决困难问题。计划是具体奋斗目标，有了自己定的目标才能有奋斗热情，加上经常检查，运动才能不断向更高阶段发展，否则一时鼓动起来的热情将会由松懈而走向消沉。第三、公私兼顾。最好超出交任务以外的部分全归个人处理。帮助个人建立家务，可以刺激生产情绪，对工作学习也有益处。第四、开展立功运动。最好是依据个人计划，按月民主检查，评功记功，对于有成绩有创造能帮助别人的同志，予以表扬奖励。
    有少数同志还有“等待”情绪。有的是等待出力少获利大的生产“妙法”。这些人主要是怕吃苦，怕麻烦，放不下架子，需要向杨主席送粪、聂部长生豆芽学习。有的是等待反攻，胜利，再进城市。这些人主要是受轻敌速胜思想的害。他们应当看见，我们在胜利之前，还有一段相当长期的艰苦的途程。在当前紧张而艰苦的斗争中，每人都应分担其光荣的一份。边府经验证明，机关生产搞起来以后，对附近群众影响很大。因此为了推动边区今年大生产运动，我们也应把机关生产做得更好一些。
