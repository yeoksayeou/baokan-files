　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taihang, dated the 15th] In their efforts to serve the people, the Shouyang Independent Battalion has once again achieved remarkable feats. At 5:00 AM on the 7th, the battalion launched a surprise attack on the 2nd Company of the Yan puppet “Revenge Detachment” stationed at Da@. After forty minutes of intense fighting, most of the defending enemy were annihilated, with 13 killed and 34 captured, including the "reverse reckoning" ringleader and "Revenge" Detachment Commander Ji Han, and Company Commander Nie Guangqian. The battalion seized one light machine gun, two small cannons, twenty-two rifles, two pistols, one warhorse, and two donkeys. Subsequently, the battalion awarded each of those who contributed to this battle with 10,000 yuan and commended each with a meritorious service citation.

　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taihang, dated the 15th] In Tangyin, after the Hebi campaign, tyrannical landlords and reverse reckoning elements are extremely alarmed. Recently, upon hearing of our great victory in Lunan, they have become even more pessimistic. Yuan Wende, the quartermaster of the South Tianmen Mining Area in the county, is a native of Tumen. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was a loyal lackey of the Japanese invaders. The masses now call him a double traitor. On the 2nd of this month, Yuan committed suicide in Hebi by placing a rifle under his chin and triggering it with his foot. Zhang Zhanmei, a member of the "Returning Home Corps" in Siwangtai, Tangyin County, revealed to the tyrannical landlord Kang Youming that their demise was imminent. Zhang said, "Once the Central Army crosses the Yellow River, where will we go? If one person leaves, what will happen to the family?" After talking, the two embraced and cried bitterly.

    【本报太行十五日电】寿阳独立营在为民立功中，再建奇勋。七日上午五时，该当奔袭驻大＠之阎伪“复仇支队”第二中队，激战四十分钟，守敌大部被歼，毙敌十三名，俘“倒算”头子“复仇”大队长继汉，中队长聂光前以下三十四名。缴获轻机枪一挺，小炮两门，步枪二十二枝，手枪两枝，战马一匹，毛驴两头。嗣后，该营对此次战斗有功者分别奖洋一万元，并各记功一次。
    【本报太行十五日电】汤阴在鹤壁战役后，恶霸倒算分子，极为慌恐。近又闻我鲁南大捷，彼等尤为悲观。该县南天门矿区司务长袁文德，系土门人，抗日战争中，即为日寇忠实走狗，现群众呼之为双料汉奸。本月二日，袁于鹤壁以步枪对举下颔，脚蹬枪机自杀毙命。该县寺望台“还乡团”张占梅向恶霸康有明透露，彼等穷途末路已迫在眉睫，张说：“中央军一过黄河，咱往那里走？一人走了，家眷怎办？”两人谈后抱头大哭。
