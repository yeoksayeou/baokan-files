　　From Five Thousand Yuan to One Million
    ——A Record of Production and Savings in Military University Team 11
    Zhang Liyun
    Military and Political University Team 11 is a new unit established last spring. At the beginning of its establishment, the higher authorities issued 5,000 yuan as activity funds, and it had nothing else. However, over the past year, in addition to various expenses, the fund has grown from 5,000 yuan to one million. This is not a miracle, but the result of diligent management and active production. "If times are tough, you have to think of tough solutions," this is the working belief of the leading cadres of Team 11.
    The first thing was to find ways to save. The team headquarters convened a research meeting of administrative staff, absorbed many opinions from the masses, and came up with many methods, proposing the slogan: "Don't leave a bowl of leftover rice, don't waste a grain of rice," and ensuring that the idea of saving was instilled in all personnel. Each time they cooked, they measured the rice according to the number of people, and the leftover rice was put into the next pot. Sometimes, if there was not enough rice, they would not ask for a second serving. Originally, 120 catties of coal were burned every day, but in order to save, the cooks would pick out the blue coal from the coal slag and burn it again, saving 20 catties of coal every day.
    In just over a month, they saved six shi (small shi) of millet. The captain and instructor personally went to the Pinghan Railway to buy four pigs (including two sows). Soon the sows gave birth to eight piglets. At the time of the July accounting, they saved 19 shi and 4 dou of rice for entertaining the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, and the company's food expenses were saved by 2,700 catties. They sold the rice and bought eight more fat pigs and twelve small pigs weighing more than ten catties. The students invested their private savings and bought twelve pigs as well. The entire team raised more than 40 pigs, which later became one of the main sources of improving the lives of Team 11 and a priceless treasure for getting rich.
    Another source of wealth was agricultural production: Because Team 11 had a good relationship with the local villager Chen Chengze, they cultivated a good vegetable garden under Chen's guidance. They listened very carefully to Chen Chengze when managing the vegetable garden, watering when they should, fertilizing when they should, and following Chen Chengze's advice on cultivating seedlings, transplanting, selecting seeds, and reserving seedlings. They were not sloppy and did not violate the agricultural season. As a result, the three-mu vegetable garden yielded 12,000 catties, with the best quality and quantity in the entire brigade. In addition, they planted seventeen mu of potatoes and five mu of radishes, harvesting more than 20,000 catties. The five mu of small plots planted by the students individually were not included in the calculation. In terms of grain production, they planted twenty-seven mu of corn, ten mu of millet, and two mu of beans, harvesting a total of more than 25 shi of grain.
    During the summer harvest, they implemented a division of labor with the mutual aid group of Wang Shuangjing, who was stationed in the village: Team 11 and the mutual aid group harvested wheat together, harvesting more than 180 mu in two days. Because of continuous rain, other mutual aid groups harvested wheat late and suffered some losses, only Wang Shuangjing's group suffered no losses at all. The mutual aid group helped Team 11 by lending them farm tools.
    Team 11 has not engaged in commercial production. They saved grain and earned money, and they either bought pigs or livestock. Once they bought livestock, they went out to engage in transportation. For example, once they transported goods for merchants from Changzhi to Handan, earning 240 catties of alkaline salt in one trip. These 240 catties of salt were invested in the cooperative, which then earned a donkey worth 40,000 yuan. Because the transportation work was done normally, they earned 30,000 to 20,000 yuan every month. Recently, they earned 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in one trip.
    Last autumn, Team 11 ate four dishes per meal and two large pigs per month. After moving to the new area, they still eat two dishes per meal and continue to eat meat regularly.

### 从五千元到一百万——记军大十一队的生产节约

　　从五千元到一百万
    ——记军大十一队的生产节约
    张立云
    军政大学十一队是去年春季成立起来的新单位，成立之初上级发给五千元作为活动基金，其他一无所有，但是一年来除了各种花费外，基金却由五千元生长到一百万。这不是一个奇迹，乃是辛勤经营积极生产的结果。“光景穷要想穷办法”，这是十一队领导干部的工作信念。
    开头一件事便是想办法节约，队部召集事务人员开研究会，吸收了许多群众意见，想了许多办法，提出：“不留一碗剩饭，不浪费一粒米”的口号，并把节约思想在全体人员中打通，每次作饭按人下米，剩的饭下在下次的锅里，有时饭少差一些也不再要第二次。烧炭原来每天一百二十斤，炊事员同志为了节省便每天从炭渣里把蓝炭拣出来再烧一次，这样，每天就省炭二十斤。
    一个来月节约了六石（小石）小米，队长指导员亲自跑到平汉线买回四口猪（内有两口母猪），不久母猪下了八个小猪娃。七月结帐时节约招待抗属米十九石四斗，连队伙食节约二千七百斤，把米卖掉又买了八头膘猪和十二口十几斤重的小猪，同学们把私人的积蓄入了股，也买了十二口猪，全队共养猪四十多口，这些猪后来就成了十一队改善生活的主要依靠之一和发财致富的无价宝。
    致富的另一泉源是农业生产：十一队因为和老乡陈成则关系好，在陈的指导下培育了一个好菜园，他们在经营菜园时非常听陈成则的话，该浇就浇、该灌粪就灌粪，培秧移栽选种留苗都照陈成则说的办，不粗糙、不违农时，结果三亩菜园收了一万二千斤，质量数量都是全大队第一。此外还种了十七亩山药蛋，五亩萝卜，收了二万多斤。同学们个人种的五亩小块地还未计算在内。在粮食生产上种了二十七亩玉茭、十亩谷子、二亩豆子，共收粮食二十五石多。
    夏收期间和驻村王双景的互助组实行分工：十一队全体互助组收麦，两天收了一百八十多亩，别的互助组由于阴雨连绵，麦子收的迟都吃了一些亏，只有王双景组一点损失也没受。互助组对于十一队的帮助是借给他们农具。
    十一队没作过商业生产，他们省了粮食赚了钱不是买猪就是买牲口，买了牲口就出去搞运输。譬如有一次从长治到邯郸给商家运货，一次就赚了二百四十斤碱盐，这二百四十斤盐入到合作社又赚了一头毛驴，价值四万，因为运输工作搞得正常，每月总要赚个三万两万的，最近有一次，竟赚了七八万。
    去年秋，十一队每顿饭要吃四个菜，每月吃两口大猪，搬到新地区后，每顿还吃两个菜，不断吃肉。
