    Jinan Troops Intensify Training
    Military Factories Step Up Production and Increase Output
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 21st dispatch] Local Jinan teams are being successively upgraded to regular army units. To defend Chairman Mao, they are intensifying training. Military factories are working hard to step up production and strengthen self-defense capabilities. A certain regiment in the military region is in the process of being upgraded, and the soldiers are discussing: "When we are upgraded to a regular army unit, we must strengthen our fight against Chiang Kai-shek and strive for an early counter-offensive." At the celebration meeting for the establishment of a certain brigade, all the soldiers expressed their willingness to compete with other brother regiments in progress and combat. The 5th and 6th Squadrons of the military region's training regiment have completed their studies, and all the trainees have vowed to perform meritorious service to defend Chairman Mao with their actions, and have all departed for the front lines. A certain sub-district's guard company was just upgraded, and not a single person has asked for leave during the spring training. Squad Leader Wang Qing'en and Third Squad Leader Wang Suo often get up in the middle of the night to practice martial arts. The Fifth Squad of the Second Platoon is making the fastest progress, throwing grenades an average of three meters farther than a week ago. All the workers at the military region's ordnance repair shop want to perform meritorious service to defend Chairman Mao, and unanimously proposed working night shifts. The workers at a certain sub-district's ordnance repair shop exceeded the original plan by one-third in half a month.
