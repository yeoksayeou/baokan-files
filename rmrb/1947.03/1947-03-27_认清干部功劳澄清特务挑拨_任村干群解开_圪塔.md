    Recognizing Cadres' Merits, Clarifying Special Agents' Sabotage:
    Ren Village Cadres and Masses Untie the "Knot"
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] This newspaper's reporter Zhan Chao reports: In Ren Village, Lin County, cadres boldly let the masses vent all their dissatisfaction with the cadres, using the power of the masses to promote cadres' conscious admission of errors and transformation of their work style; they also guided the masses to recognize the cadres' merits and cherish the cadres, creating an experience that enables the masses to untie the "knot," unite closely, and deepen the land reform movement.
    Ren Village, after rent reduction in 1942 and years of investigation and reduction, especially after a period of relatively free reckoning and struggle last summer, saw most of the land revert to the peasants. However, due to insufficient mobilization of the masses and limitations on the duration of rent reduction and reckoning, the fruits were gained individually, and the phenomenon of uneven wealth among the peasants still existed. What was particularly important was that the poor work style of the village cadres and their greater gains from the fruits caused dissatisfaction among the masses, preventing them from concentrating all their efforts against external forces, so that feudal forces could still operate in secret, engaging in instigation and sabotage. At the beginning of this year, the leadership called for deepening land reform to fill the gaps and make up for the deficiencies. No matter how the leadership guided, the masses' response was always, "The landlords have nothing left," "Struggling leads to good houses and land, but we can't buy them if we want to, the struggle is in vain!" The leadership felt that if the relationship between cadres and the masses was not resolved, the movement would be difficult to deepen further. Therefore, they inspired the masses to raise any questions they had, negotiating until late at night, which resulted in the revelation that twenty-six poor peasant households in the village lacked land and housing, that more than sixty people had not received any fruits, and many specific opinions were raised regarding cadres' greater gains from the fruits.
    At the same time, the leadership inspired the cadres to consciously solve the cadre-mass relationship first. The chairman of the peasant association and the militia instructor had both considered avoiding their own problems and first struggling against feudalism. The leadership then raised a question: "Do we act according to the opinions of the masses, or do we ask the masses to act according to our opinions?" Cheng Yufang, the more conscious political director, said, "Of course, we act according to the masses! Forcing the masses to act according to us, what kind of service to the masses is that!" The meeting fell silent. The leadership then inspired everyone to reflect: "Why do cadres prepare to move their families away as soon as they hear about war preparations, even when the enemy is still far away? Aren't they just afraid of being unable to lead the masses when the time comes?" At this meeting, the cadres initially examined their past mistakes of putting labels on the masses, using "turning big things into small things" and "turning small things into nothing" to shut the mouths of the masses; they proposed: Only by letting the masses vent their grievances and release their anger can the knot be thoroughly untied, but their consciousness was not high enough, and their self-criticism was not thorough enough.
    After discussion, the leadership felt that to thoroughly solve the problem, the power of the masses must be used to promote it. In the evening, they convened the masses in the Dadong School to encourage them to express their opinions as much as possible. The more the masses talked, the more energetic they became. The director of the Fourth Street Armed Committee could not help but stand up and explain, but the masses did not say a word. The leadership re-mobilized, and finally even the most honest masses raised their opinions.
    The next morning, a village-wide cadre meeting was held for self-reflection. The cadres' determination was greater. Cheng Yufang, the political director, first admitted that what the masses said was true. He himself had indeed embezzled a woolen coat in the past, bought an extra estate, and a silkworm slope. Then the town head also admitted his mistakes of protecting his father-in-law and preventing the masses from struggling against him. More than thirty cadres successively reflected on the fact that they had misappropriated or gained more from the fruits of struggle in the past. The leadership allowed everyone to find their own solutions. The cadres all voluntarily confessed their mistakes to the masses, even mentioning what they should return. Some took off their gold rings and removed their fur coats on the spot.
    At the same time, the branch committee secretary led the masses in a meeting. After thoroughly venting their grievances and releasing their anger, everyone felt much lighter, but their resentment towards the cadres was still deep. At this time, the leadership consciously guided the masses towards unity, making them recognize the cadres' merits and cherish the cadres, and the masses' emotions immediately changed. Everyone spoke of many of the cadres' good points.
    On the third day, a joint meeting of village cadres and the masses was held again to allow the masses to continue to express their opinions, and the result was very satisfactory. The masses all said, "If they have merits and can correct their mistakes, we should all support them well." Therefore, even the Second Street Peasant Association chairman, who was previously the most dissatisfied, was only asked to return half of his real estate and livestock. The masses insisted on putting the fur coat returned by Cheng Yufang back on him, showing an unprecedented love for the cadres in recent years. The cadres were deeply moved and more bravely accepted criticism from the masses and corrected their mistakes.
    Next, the masses were allowed to review the cadres to see who could be and who could not be cadres. After deliberation in street and group, the masses all agreed, "Apart from those who are in their mother's womb and those who have entered the grave, who doesn't have some mistakes!" "A good cadre is one who corrects his mistakes." All the current cadres were approved, although some individuals insisted on replacing cadres, the masses did not agree. The cadres then guaranteed to the masses, "We will definitely work harder in the future to lead everyone to turn over completely."
    After the cadre-mass relationship was thoroughly resolved, the masses automatically launched a "tell the truth" and "one heart" movement. Hu Fuhe said, "I made a mistake! I want to confess, Mi Quanying asked me to get people to give false opinions about the cadres (frame them) and replace all the cadres. I did this and I'm really sorry to everyone, I even lost my father's face!" Another militiaman and a woman from the Third Street also reflected the same situation. Mi Quanying, a member of the peasant association, saw that others had told the truth and voluntarily confessed, saying, "I did get people to give false opinions about the cadres, but I am not the root, the root is Zhang Zibin (a special agent) from Dongge." As a result, the masses all recognized the despicable nature of the special agents and demanded to struggle against the special agents. The cadres deeply realized that "With the masses, the activities of special agents can definitely be clarified." The relationship between cadres and the masses became unprecedentedly close.

    认清干部功劳澄清特务挑拨
    任村干群解开“圪塔”
    【本报特讯】本报记者展潮报导：林县任村镇大胆放手让群众发泄所有对干部的不满，以群众力量，推动干部自觉认错转变作风；又引导群众认识干部功劳爱护干部，创造了使群众解开“圪塔”，亲密团结深入土地改革运动的经验。
    任村经过四二年减租与历年查减，尤其是去夏一段较放手的清算斗争，大部土地转归农民。但由于群众发动不充分，减租清算有年限限制，果实是各得各的，农民中贫富不均现象仍存在。特别重要的是由于村干部作风不好以及多得果实，造成群众对干部不满，不能集中全力对外，以致封建势力仍能暗中活动，挑拨破坏。今年年初，领导上号召深入土地改革，填平补齐。不管领导上怎么引导，群众的反映总是“地主没啥了”、“斗争出了好房好地咱想买不能买，斗争白搭啦！”领导上感到干群关系不解决，运动很难进一步深入，便启发群众让大家有问题尽管提，一直谈判深夜，提出了村里有二十六户贫农缺地缺房，六十多人没有分到过果实，对干部多得果实提出了不少条具体意见。
    同时领导上便又启发干部自觉首先解决干群关系，农会主席、民兵指导员都曾有过想避开自己问题先斗封建的想法。领导上乃提出一个问题：咱依照群众意见办事，还是叫群众依咱意见办事？”较自觉的政治主任程毓芳说：“当然是咱依群众呀！硬叫群众依咱，还叫什么为群众服务！”会场沉默了。领导上接着启发大家反省：“为啥干部一听到备战，敌人还老远便准备搬家？光怕到时候领不起群众？”这次会上，干部们初步检讨了过去给群众戴大帽子、用“大事化小事”，“小事化无事”来堵群众嘴的毛病；提出：只有让群众发尽牢骚出透气，才能彻底解圪塔，但自觉不够，检讨不彻底。
    领导上经过讨论，觉得要彻底解决问题，必须用群众力量来推动。晚间便又在大冬学里号召群众尽量提意见。群众越谈越有劲，四街武委会主任忍耐不住站起来解释了一番，群众都不吭了。领导上又重新动员，最后连最老实的群众也提了意见。
    第二天早起召开全村干部会反省。干部决心大了，政治主任程毓芳首先承认群众提的都是事实。自己过去确曾贪污了一件毛衣，多买了座庄子，一个蚕坡。接着镇长也承认了自己包庇老丈人，不让群众斗争等错误。三十多个干部都相继反省了过去挪用或多得斗争果实的事实。领导上让大家自寻解决办法，干部们都自愿向群众坦白认错，连应退东西都说了说，有的当场把金戒指取下，把皮大氅脱掉。
    和这同时，分委书记领着群众开会，大家经过彻底发牢骚出气，心头都松快了许多，但对干部的怨恨仍深。领导上此时有意识的向团结方面引，使群众认识干部功劳，爱护干部，群众情绪立时起了变化。你一言我一语说了很多干部的好处。
    第三天又召开全村干部与群众联合大会，让群众继续提意见，结果很圆满。群众都说：“有功劳，犯了错误能改，咱们都应好好拥护。”因此大家连以前最不满意的二街农会主席，也只让他退出半数房地牲口。程毓芳退出的皮大衣，群众坚决又披到他身上，表现了数年来未有的对干部的爱护。干部深受感动，更勇敢的接受群众批评，改正错误。
    接着让群众审查干部，看谁能当谁不能当，群众经过分街分组酝酿，都认为“除了在娘肚里和入了土的人，谁个没有点错误！”“有错改错就是好干部。”全数批准了现任干部，虽有个别人坚持要撤换干部，群众都不同意。干部则向群众保证：“今后一定更努力工作领导大家翻透身。”
    干群关系彻底解决后，群众自动来了个“说老实话”“一条心”运动。胡福和说：“我可办错啦！我要坦白坦白，米全英叫我活动人给干部提假意见（栽赃），把全体干部都换了。我办这真对不起大家，连我爹的人也丢了！”另外一个民兵与三街一个妇女也反映了同样情形。米全英是个农会会员，看见别人都说了实话，也自动坦白说：“我确实活动给干部提假意见，可是我不是老根，老根是东阁张子斌（特务）。”这一来，群众都认清了特务的卑鄙，要求斗争特务。干部则深刻体会到“有了群众，特务活动定能澄清。”干群关系空前地密切起来。
