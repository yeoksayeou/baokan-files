    Our Army's Six Hundred Plus Taiwanese Soldiers Respond to the Taiwan Autonomy Movement
    [This newspaper's dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front on the 24th] Over six hundred Taiwanese soldiers in the People's Liberation Army, in response to the Taiwan people's autonomy movement, have recently published an open letter to their fellow Taiwanese compatriots, the original text of which is as follows:
    Taiwanese fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters! We are all workers, farmers, and students from Taipei County and Hsinchu County in Taiwan. Last year, we were seized by the utterly ruthless Chiang Kai-shek to serve as soldiers, forcing us to attack the North China Liberated Areas. Because we knew that Chiang Kai-shek was the enemy of the people, we quickly laid down our weapons and joined the People's Liberation Army, fighting for the independence, democracy, freedom, and peace of our motherland.
    Our Taiwan has just been liberated from fifty years of enslavement by the Japanese bandits, but Chiang Kai-shek has brought us even more cruel exploitation and darker rule than the Japanese bandits, and has sold our beautiful and rich homeland to American imperialism. The hideous faces of Chiang and the Americans have been recognized by all our Taiwanese compatriots. Although Chiang Kai-shek used all kinds of cruel means to coerce us to abandon our homes, we have never forgotten the disaster-stricken "Formosa" (note: this is a beautiful name that Taiwanese people use for Taiwan) under the oppression of Chiang and the Americans. When we heard the news of your armed uprising, how moved and encouraged we were! We vow to fight the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to the death to support and cooperate with you. When you raise your self-defense guns and shed blood with the enemy, and know that your children are fighting our common enemy on the front lines of the patriotic self-defense war, how gratified and courageous you will be a hundredfold!
    Fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters! Although we are not fighting on the same battlefield, our gun muzzles are aimed at the same enemy—Chiang Kai-shek. Our goals are the same—to liberate the motherland and liberate Taiwan. Our victory is the victory of our homes; similarly, the victory of our homes is our victory. We must persevere in the war to the end, until the bloody rule of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and traitorous regime is ended.
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation!
    Long live the Taiwan Autonomy Movement!

    我军中六百余台湾战士响应台湾自治运动
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十四日电】人民解放军中之台湾战士六百余人，为响应台湾人民自治运动，顷发表告台湾同胞书，原文如下：
    台湾父老兄弟姊妹们！我们都是台湾台北县和新竹县的工人、农民和学生，去年被穷凶极恶的蒋介石抓来当兵，强迫我们进攻华北解放区，因为知道蒋介石是人民的公敌，我们很快就放下武器，参加了人民解放军，为祖国的独立民主自由和平而战。
    我们台湾刚从日寇五十年的奴役下解放出来，而蒋介石却带给我们比日寇更残酷的压榨和更黑暗的统治，又将我们美丽富饶的家乡，出卖给美帝国主义。蒋美的狞狰面目，已为我全体台胞所认识了。我们虽然被蒋介石用各种残毒手段，胁迫我们离弃家园，但我们没有一刻忘记过在蒋美欺压下的灾难深重的“福尔摩沙”（按：这是台湾人对台湾的美称），当我们听到你们武装起义的消息，我们是多么的感动和振奋！我们誓与蒋介石卖国贼作殊死战，以支援、配合你们。当你们擎起自卫枪支与敌人喋血的时候，知道了你们的子弟却正在爱国自卫战争前线上和我们同时的敌人搏斗的时候，你们将是多么的快慰和奋勇百倍啊！
    父老兄弟姊妹们！我们虽不在一个战场上作战，但我们的枪口是向着一个敌人—蒋介石发射，我们的奋斗目标都是一个——解放祖国、解放台湾，我们的胜利就是家里的胜利；同样的，家里的胜利也就是我们的胜利。我们必须把战争坚持到最后，直到结束蒋介石独裁卖国的血腥统治。
    中国人民解放万岁！
    台湾自治运动万岁！
