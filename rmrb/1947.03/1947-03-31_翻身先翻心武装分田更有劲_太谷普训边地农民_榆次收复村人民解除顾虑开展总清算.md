Turning the Mindset First Makes Armed Land Distribution More Effective
    Taigu Extensively Trains Farmers in Border Areas
    Yuci Recaptured Villages Remove Concerns and Launch General Liquidation
    [Report from this newspaper's Taihang, 29th] After our army recovered strongholds such as Xiaobai and Baiyan in Taigu last month on the 17th, more than 40,000 people in the Pingchuan area were encouraged to reverse the settling of accounts and carry out a major transformation, even working in villages like ××, only three to five miles away from the enemy. This time, the ability to accomplish this was mainly due to the method of "extensively training farmers to first turn their minds." Last autumn, the masses did not turn their minds (i.e., were not awakened), and cadres simply gave them some fruits of the struggle. When the war came, many people returned these gains to the landlords. After this test, the cadres were educated, and this time they first trained more than 430 activists at the district level and then extensively trained more than 40,000 farmers through joint defense or village compilation, launching campaigns to pour out grievances. With the farmers ideologically awakened, they were motivated, and all kinds of methods were devised. For example, fearing the enemy's arrival, the militia took the initiative to attack, burying layers of landmines on the roads, blockading the enemy, and protecting the gains of the transformation. In villages closest to the enemy, such as ××, in addition to the militia, a "Guard the Fruits of the Transformation Security Team" was also organized. The farmers' associations have also expanded, launching liquidation movements everywhere, determined to eliminate feudalism and achieve a thorough transformation.
    [Report from this newspaper's Taihang, 27th] Villages in the border areas of Yuci, such as Dongxijianzi, carried out a transformation struggle in August of last year, initially completing land reform. After the enemy stubbornly occupied the area in October of last year, most of the fruits of the transformation for the farmers were lost. After the area was liberated again at the end of January, a movement to reverse the settling of accounts and conduct a general liquidation was immediately launched. The district first convened a meeting of a large number of village cadres and activists to discuss: "Do we still dare to turn over?" Many people felt that the gains of the transformation could not be protected if the enemy came, and they would instead lose their shirts. Militia hero Tian Si'er said: "This time when the enemy came, the landlord robbed me of my quilts and grain, and I had no way to survive. But this time I dare to, want to, and must turn over again. If I don't, I can't survive even more." After he finished speaking, everyone followed suit. Some said they didn't dare to turn over, and would wait until we had taken Yuci City before turning over. Others said: "Don't be afraid! Dare to turn over. The landlord has reversed the settlement of accounts, so we can't spare him. The more he reverses, the angrier we get, and we must turn over resolutely and thoroughly." In the end, everyone agreed ideologically that they should turn over and mustered the courage to dare to turn over. Then, based on the lessons learned from this war, they discussed how to preserve the fruits of the transformation. Everyone shared their experiences. Tian Lizhen said: "The landlord Tian Qianli reversed the settling of accounts with me, but I didn't give it to him. I said the fruits were mine, not yours, and I had already eaten the grain, so the landlord couldn't do anything. We must fight those damn guys." Yu Yinxi said: "I deposited my fruits in ×× village in the base area and didn't lose them. Those that were not transferred and were carried on our bodies were robbed by the enemy. It's better to deposit the fruits in the base area." An Erze said: "I didn't deposit my fruits in the base area, but I didn't lose them either because I buried them well and didn't let anyone know." Finally, from the discussion, they clarified the methods of preserving the fruits. In addition to transferring and burying them, they also needed to expand the militia, increase the number of guns, eliminate small groups of enemies when they came, and transfer when large groups came. Those big special agent landlords who refused to submit to death were resolutely suppressed so that they could not escape. After resolving the ideological and practical problems, everyone's fighting spirit was extremely high, and they all said that they could now turn over and dared to turn over. Ren Gengniu said: "This solves the problem. New accounts plus old accounts, a general liquidation. It's no good being a good man if we don't defeat the landlord." Currently, the reverse settling of accounts and the general liquidation in the district are proceeding vigorously.

    翻身先翻心武装分田更有劲
    太谷普训边地农民
    榆次收复村人民解除顾虑开展总清算
    【本报太行二十九日电】上月十七日我军收复太谷小白、白燕等据点后，平川四万余群众又鼓起劲来反倒算大翻身，一直干到离敌三五里路的××等村。这次能大干起来，主要是用了“普训农民先翻心”方法。去秋群众没翻心（即未觉悟），只是干部给了些果实，战争到来，不少群众给地主退果实。经过这一考验，干部受到教育，这次就首先以区集训了四百三十余积极分子，又以联防或编村普训了四万余农民、发动了诉苦。农民思想觉悟，干起来有劲，一切办法也就想出来了，如怕敌人来，民兵就主动出击，把地雷层层埋到路上，封锁敌人，保卫翻身。离敌最近的××等村除民兵外，还组织了“保卫翻身警卫队”。农会也扩大了，到处开展清算，决心消灭封建翻透身。
    【本报太行二十七日电】榆次边地东西见子等村，去年八月，群众就进行了翻身斗争，初步完成土地改革。去年十月敌顽侵占后，所有翻身农民果实大部受到损失，一月底再度解放后，便立即进行反倒算与总清算运动。区上首先召开了大批村干和积极分子会讨论：“是否还敢翻身？”有不少人觉得翻下果实敌人来了保不住，反赔了老底。民兵英雄田四儿说：“这次敌人来，地主把我被子、粮食都抢走了，当下就没法活。但这次再闹翻身，我是敢翻、要翻、必须翻，不翻就越不能活。”他说完后，大家就跟着发言，有的说是不敢翻，等咱打了榆次城再翻吧。另一些人说：“不怕！敢翻，地主倒算了，不能饶了他。他越倒算咱越火气大，要坚决彻底的翻。”最后思想上都同意了要翻，并鼓起了敢翻身的勇气，接着以这次战争的教训，讨论如何保存果实的问题。大家各个都说出了自己的经验。田立贞说：“地主田千利向我们倒算果实，我没有给他，我说果实是我的，并不是你的，我已将粮食吃了，地主也没办法。非和狗日们斗争不行。”宇银喜说：“我把果实寄放在根据地××村就没丢了，没有转移出去的和身上背着的，敌人便抢走了。果实还是往根据地寄放好。”安二则说：“我的果实没有往根据地寄放，但也没丢了。因我埋藏的好，又没让别人知道”。最后从讨论中明确了保存果实的办法，除用转移埋藏等方法外，更要扩大民兵，增多枪支，少部敌人来就消灭他，大部来了转移。最坏的大特务地主死不归服者，坚决镇压，不让他们跑了。解决了思想与实际问题后，大家斗争情绪极高，都说这就能翻敢翻了。任更牛说：“这一下可把问题解决了，新账加旧账，一笔总清算，干不倒地主不算好汉。”现该区反倒算与总清算正猛烈进行中。
