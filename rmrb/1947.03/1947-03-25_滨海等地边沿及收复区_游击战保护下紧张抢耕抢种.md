    Coastal and Other Border Areas and Recovered Areas
    Guerilla Warfare Protects
    Tense Seizing of Agricultural Opportunities
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd) In the border areas of coastal Shandong and other places in southern Shandong, and in the newly recovered areas behind Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the seizing of agricultural opportunities is being carried out tensely under the effective protection of guerilla warfare. In more than two hundred villages near the suburbs, the armed work teams and militia are watching the enemy from high places. More than eight hundred yokes of oxen organized by the masses in each village are working hard together; those without oxen are pulling plows together in groups of five or six. Since the 12th, from morning till night, the sound of urging oxen can be heard everywhere. In a certain village, 190 households have 30 yokes of oxen and have cultivated 420 mu of land in three days. Li Zhimei and his six brothers have completed plowing all 21 mu of their spring land. It is estimated that spring plowing in the village will be completed in a few days. In Tancheng, Linyi, Donghai and other counties, more than 120 villages and towns newly recovered behind Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the people who had left their homes are returning to their homes to engage in spring plowing. After the masses in a certain village in the Puxi district of Donghai drove away the "Home Returning Corps" following the people's local armed forces, they immediately returned home to repair farm tools, deliver manure and plant the land. All forty women and twenty-four children in the village participated in the labor exchange. In the third district of Cangshan (new county) south of the Lin (Yi) Zao (Zhuang) Highway, north-south joint defense is implemented. The militia, in coordination with the field protection brigade, is actively operating in the border areas every day, cracking down on Chiang Kai-shek's troops who are looting grain, and protecting more than 47,000 masses in the entire district to seize the opportunity to plant.
