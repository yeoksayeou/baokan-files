    Pay Attention to Achieving County-Wide Balance
    Neiqiu Launches Another Review
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 27th dispatch] After in-depth movement, the land reform movement in Neiqiu County is currently focusing on catching up with the lagging areas to achieve balance, carrying out a comprehensive second in-depth inspection, and launching a solidarity movement. Since December of last year, the county has proposed the guiding principle of in-depth movement of checking land and making up deficiencies. All districts in the county have universally trained approximately 6,000 poor and hired peasants at grassroots units. The training broke down the ideas of not valuing land (due to lack of labor and fear of burden) and the sentiment of struggling against middle peasants. It clarified for whom the investigation and replenishment were being carried out; who was being investigated and what was being investigated; to whom was it being replenished, and what was being replenished; and how to investigate. After returning to the villages, they closely combined ideological education and held comparison meetings, raising the slogan: "Think about the past, look at the present." How were you oppressed in the past and what was life like? How have you been emancipated now? What have you been given? What is still lacking? Each village used the method of small groups complaining about suffering, large groups leading to complaints, and then small groups complaining again, repeatedly complaining and leading to complaints, to raise the class consciousness of the peasants and inspire demands for replenishment, discovering many problems. In District One alone, it was found that there were still 342 feudal hidden landlords who had not been struggled against or had not been thoroughly struggled against, hiding more than 3,400 mu of land and 61 head of livestock in various ways. Because the class divisions were unclear in the past, landlords infiltrated the leading groups, deceived the masses, and preserved themselves. For example, Yang Wanzeng, a landlord in Nan Street, even served as the chairman of the peasant association, and the civil affairs commissioner was also a landlord. Eleven landlord households, although they had been struggled against, only gave the peasants some dilapidated houses and meager land, merely skimming the surface. They deceived those above and oppressed those below, and the peasants did not dare to struggle. After the problem was discovered, the leadership immediately expressed its attitude of "helping the peasants to thoroughly eliminate feudalism and achieve complete emancipation," supporting the peasants and taking the lead for them, first removing the bad cadres and strengthening their confidence in emancipation, and launching a fierce struggle. According to statistics from Districts One and Two alone, more than 13,500 mu of land, 7,800 rooms, and more than 400 head of livestock were recovered. The fruits of the labor were fairly and rationally distributed, with land allocated according to mu and yield, houses according to need, and livestock according to size and amount of cultivated land; special care was taken for military families in addition to the prescribed distribution, and care was given to the orphaned and widowed with no labor, drawing from the bad to supplement the good, and drawing from the far to supplement the near. Poor peasants generally saw an increase in land, laying the foundation for production. For example, before the movement, poor peasants in Dong Street had one mu of land per person, but now they have reached four mu, and middle peasants have also increased. Statistics from District Two show that each peasant has reached an average of four to five mu of land. However, due to different work foundations and conditions, there are still a dozen villages, with remnants of feudal tails and silent peasants, that are still lagging behind. To this end, at the beginning of the month, the county and district cadre meetings decided to: organize forces to attack the backward villages, mobilize the silent peasants, and completely eliminate the feudal tails. In general villages, there should be another in-depth inspection to resolve outstanding issues, adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses, carry out ideological education, raise awareness, and launch a great unity movement among the peasants.

    注意争取全县平衡
    内邱开展再次复查
    【本报太行二十七日电】内邱的土地改革运动，经过深入运动，刻正突击落后争取平衡，进行普遍的再次深入检查，开展团结运动。该县从去年十二月即提出查田补齐的深入运动方针，全县各区均普遍的分基点训练了贫、雇农民约六千余人，训练中打破了不重视土地（没劳力，怕负担）思想与斗争中农的情绪。明确了为谁查补；查谁查什么；给谁补，补什么；如何查等问题。回村后紧密结合思想教育，开比比会，提出：“想想过去，看看现在。”过去如何受压迫生活如何？现在身翻的如何？分了些什么？还缺些什么？各村均以小组诉苦，大组引苦，再到小组诉苦，反复的诉苦引苦的方式，提高了农民阶级觉悟，启发了填补要求，发现了许多问题。仅一区清查出未斗或斗的不彻底的封建隐蔽地主还有三百四十二户，用各种方式隐藏着土地三千四百余亩，牲口六十一头。因过去阶级划分不明，地主混入领导集团，欺骗群众，保存自己。如南街地主杨万增还任农会主席，民政委员也是地主。有十一户地主，虽经斗争，也给予农民一些破房薄地，只是烫了层皮。欺上压下，农民不敢斗争。问题发现后，领导上即表明“帮助农民彻底消灭封建翻透身”的态度，替农民撑腰作主，首先撤换坏干部，坚定了翻身信心，开展了猛烈的斗争。仅一、二区统计，又收回土地一万三千五百余亩，房屋七千八百余间，牲口四百余头。所得果实均公平合理分配，土地按亩按产量，房屋按需要，牲口按大小及耕田多少；对军属掌握了除按规定分配再优待，对孤寡没劳力的照顾，抽坏补好，抽远补近，贫农获得土地普遍上升，打下了生产基础。如东街运动前贫农每人一亩地，现在达到四亩，中农亦有增加。二区统计每个农民，则已平均达到四至五亩土地。但由于工作基础与条件不同，还有十数村，残存封建尾巴与不吭气农民，仍为落后村。为此月初县区干部会决定：组织力量突击落后村，发动不吭气农民，彻底消除封建尾巴。在一般村则应再次深入检查，解决遗留问题，调整干群关系，进行思想教育，提高觉悟，开展农民大团结运动。
