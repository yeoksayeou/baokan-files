Thirty-Eighth Army Training Corps

Learning Enthusiasm Grows Daily

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The learning enthusiasm of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's Thirty-Eighth Army Training Corps is increasing daily, discipline is good, and relations between the military and the people are harmonious. The team started on March 1st, and first carried out two weeks of ideological education. Under the slogan of "Lay down your burdens and study with peace of mind," they overcame the erroneous ideas of treating the training as a chore, thinking that it was unavoidable to be rotated, using the training as a bridge for job transfers, or regarding the training as a way to muddle through. In the third week, military studies began. Brigade and team-level cadres proposed a leadership style of "taking off shoes and going into the water, going deep into the lower levels." On average, each class had a cadre responsible for leadership. Special group leaders were set up for each technical class. Before class, the group leader convened education to research teaching methods, and then promoted them to all teams for unified implementation. Experiences and methods in learning were collected and immediately disseminated to each team. The brigade has a "Teaching Voice Newspaper," and the teams have blackboards, specializing in the exchange of experience. Mutual aid groups in the classes all formulated individual learning plans in coordination with the merit-making campaign. Now, learning enthusiasm is growing daily. For example, Comrade Xi Shangxu, the instructor of the Second Team, although his arm is disabled, in order to take the lead, his learning plan is to shoot 25 rings in target practice, throw grenades 30 meters, and perform bayonet drills and other subjects the same as the students. Student Song Xiewen used small wooden sticks tied to his finger joints to practice the 90-degree bend when pulling the trigger. Li Zuwu of the First Team was also unaccustomed to bending his fingers, so he practiced anytime, anywhere. Gao Jianying of the Third Team was approved by the doctor to rest, but still studied while sick.

    三十八军教导队
    学习情绪日高
    【本报特讯】西北民主联军第三十八军教导队学习情绪日益高涨，纪律良好，军民融洽。该队于三月一日开学，首先进行了两周思想教育，在“放下包袱安心学习”的口号下，克服了对轮训当做支差，认为不得已轮到就受受，及借轮训做为调动工作的桥梁，或把轮训当为混招牌等错误思想。第三周开始军事学习，大队及队级干部提出“脱鞋下水，深入下层”的领导方式，平均一个班就有一个干部负责领导；各技术课专设组长，课前组长召集教育研究教学方法，再推及各队统一实施；并收集学习中的经验办法，即时传播各队。大队有《教声报》，队有黑板报，专门交流经验。班内互助组都配合立功运动订出个人学习计划，现下学习情绪日益高涨。如二队教导员席尚需同志虽臂部残废，为了起带头作用，他的学习计划是打靶二十五环，投弹卅公尺，刺杀及其他课目与学员一样。学员宋锡文用小木棍绑在手指节上，练习引枪时九十度的弯曲，一队李祖武手指也不习惯弯曲，他随时随地的练；三队高健英经医生批准休养，仍抱病学习。        （王文治）
