　　Shahe's Experience in Combating Counterfeit Currency
　　[This newspaper's Shahe dispatch] The mass anti-counterfeit currency struggle in Shahe from top to bottom has achieved remarkable results and experience. This struggle began in July last year, starting with cadres in county and district departments, and then penetrating into various villages, forming a mass movement. There was even a day when 30 counterfeit currency criminals were captured. Zhang, the head of the Judicial Section, once specialized in the interrogation and education of counterfeit currency criminals. According to incomplete statistics, 1,431,500 yuan of counterfeit currency was seized in half a year. The methods and experiences are as follows: 1. The Shahe Bank vividly carried out extensive publicity, making cadres of various agencies realize that the anti-counterfeit currency struggle should be one of the political tasks. For example, Du, an old government traffic officer, would chase after anyone who used counterfeit currency. Duan Changying, the head of the Industry and Commerce Section, alone found 100,900 yuan. 2. In July, the bank held short-term (five-day) training classes for the commercial associations, exchanges, and exchange offices in various market towns to enable them to recognize counterfeit currency. It was stipulated that counterfeit currency identification committees should be established in various market towns, with three or five members, from which a person in charge would be selected. Every market day, they would go to the market to inspect or conduct individual publicity. After more than 20 days, most of the counterfeit currency on the market was transferred to the countryside, changing its sales methods. The bank also mobilized primary school teachers to learn to recognize counterfeit currency at a meeting of primary school teachers convened by the government, and bank comrades often went to the countryside to publicize. 3. Once someone is found to be using counterfeit currency, immediately trace the source. Even if they are indeed good people, they should be educated to raise the public's vigilance. At the same time, it should be explained that this was made by Chiang Kai-shek, and everyone should get rid of it for the sake of everyone. In order to avoid misunderstandings or the escape of counterfeit currency criminals, the method of issuing slips was adopted. If you cannot recognize it yourself, you can ask the payer to issue a slip, and then find the bank exchange office to identify it.

　　沙河反假票取得经验
    【本报沙河讯】沙河自上而下的群众性反假票斗争已获得显著成绩与经验。这一斗争开始于去年七月，首先从县区各部门干部做起，继又深入各村，形成群众性运动，曾一天即查获假票犯三十名，司法科张科长曾一度专作假票犯审讯与教育工作。据不完全统计，半年查获之假票达一百四十三万一千五百元。其办法及经验为：一、沙河银行生动进行广泛宣传，使各机关干部认识到反假票斗争应是政治任务之一，如政府交通员杜老太每见有人化假票，就直追到底。工商科段长英一人即查出十万零九千元。二、七月份银行举办了各集镇商联会、交易所、兑换所的短期（五日）训练班，使能认清假票，规定各集镇设立假票识别委员会，由三个或五个委员中再选出负责人，每逢集日，即到市场检查或个别宣传，经过二十多天，集上假票大部转入农村，改变其推销方式，银行又在政府召开的小学教员会上动员大小学生学认假票，银行同志则经常下乡宣传。三、一经查出使用假票者，立即追根，即使确系好人，亦应进行教育，提高群众警惕，同时要说明这是蒋介石造的，大家害大家除，使假票无处活动。为避免误会，或假票犯逃掉，采用了打条办法，自己认不清时可叫付款人打张纸条，然后找银行兑换所辨认。
