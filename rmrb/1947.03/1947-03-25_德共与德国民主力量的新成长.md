    The New Growth of the German Communist Party and Democratic Forces in Germany
    From Hitler's rise to power in March 1933 to Germany's surrender in May 1945, the German people suffered under fascism for a full twelve years, with cannons replacing butter and concentration camps becoming the law.
    However, no matter how high the flames of fascism rose, the German people, under the leadership of the German Communist Party (GCP), resolutely fought for democracy and freedom. At the end of 1942, representatives of the GCP, the Social Democratic Party, anti-Hitler Nazi Party members, and people from all walks of life secretly held a national anti-war movement conference. After June 1943, this movement more broadly involved Catholics, liberals, and old political parties. Anti-war demonstrations were even held in Berlin, and the "Free Germany Fighting Committee" actively operated in Munich, the Nazi stronghold. In July 1943, German prisoners of war, members of parliament from various parties, provincial councilors, trade union leaders, and liberal writers formed the "National Committee for a Free Germany" in Moscow, laying the foundation for the growth of the new Germany today. When Hitler was on the verge of collapse, the German people also coordinated with the Allied forces' offensive, staging large-scale uprisings in Hamburg, Bremen, Munich, and other places.
    From the surrender until now, Germany has been under the separate occupation and joint control of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France.
    In these four occupation zones, the development of the GCP and German democratic forces has varied due to the different policies of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. However, the Communist Party, Social Democratic Party, Free Democratic Party, and Christian Democratic Party in each occupation zone formed an anti-fascist people's united front shortly after the surrender. They formulated a common action program regarding Germany's domestic and foreign affairs, including purging the remnants of Nazism, rebuilding a democratic Germany, and rapidly restoring the German national economy.
    The number of Communist Party members throughout Germany has grown from 350,000 before the war to 670,000 now. In the Soviet occupation zone, the Communist Party merged with the Social Democratic Party on April 13th of last year, renaming itself the Socialist Unity Party (SED). In the British and American occupation zones, the Communist Party also took unified action with the SED in February of this year, jointly forming a Central Executive Committee. During the nationwide elections on September 15th of last year, the SED and the Communist parties in the British, American, and French occupation zones won more than 6.3 million votes (if the left-wing forces of the Social Democratic Party in the British, American, and French occupation zones are included, the total number of votes was more than 9.6 million, accounting for more than one-third of the total votes). In November, the SED also announced its draft German constitution. In the Berlin city government, the GCP's strength is significant. Paul Schwenk is the Assistant Mayor, Margarete Sommer is in charge of social welfare, and education and broadcasting are also under the GCP's control. From August 1945 to April 1946, the number of GCP members in Berlin doubled, reaching more than 32,000, becoming the largest party in Berlin. In the three provinces of the Soviet occupation zone, the GCP and the Social Democratic Party jointly formed a government in June 1945. GCP member Börnli served as the Second Deputy Chairman in Brandenburg Province, Bergerling Leienki served as the First Deputy Chairman, and Gesaburg served as the Third Deputy Chairman. In Saxony Province, Fischer served as the First Deputy Chairman. In 1946, these three provinces established a unified new government, with the Communist Party holding five of the twelve ministerial positions. The prestige of GCP leaders Bartel, Chairman Pieck, and Vice-Chairman Walter Ulbricht has become the beacon of light for the German people, following in the footsteps of Thälmann.
    Under the leadership of the GCP, the German labor movement has also developed vigorously, initially in the Soviet occupation zone and later expanding to the British, American, and French occupation zones. The Free German Trade Union Federation has millions of members. Peasants in the Soviet occupation zone have also turned over under the support of the GCP. From the promulgation of the land reform decree in Saxony Province in September 1945 to the basic completion of land reform throughout the Soviet occupation zone in December of the same year, according to the preliminary report of the Central Agricultural and Forestry Administration, 7,000 large landowners were liquidated, and 281,953 peasant households (including some immigrants) were allocated land. The rural foundation of German fascism and militarism has been completely shattered.
    Last year, Pieck stated that the tasks of the GCP and German democratic forces are: "To liquidate Nazism and militarism, to deprive the great landowners, large trusts, and financial capital of their power, to purge Nazis from all state institutions and local autonomous governments, to eliminate Nazis from educational and industrial institutions, to punish war criminals and Nazi leaders, to promote the reconstruction of the German economy, to establish a democratic and unified Germany, and to establish friendly relations with all countries." Although some of these tasks have been completed, the current situation requires even greater efforts from the GCP and the German people, especially in the democratic reforms of the American, British, and French occupation zones. Without strong democratic forces, it is difficult to eliminate the fascist remnants nurtured by American, British, and French imperialist elements.

    德共与德国民主力量的新成长
    从一九三三年三月希特勒登台到一九四五年五月德国投降，整整十二年的时间，德国人民受着法西斯的磨难，大炮代替了牛油、集中营就是法律。
    然而不管法西斯的凶焰有多么高，德国人民在德共领导下坚决的为民主自由而战斗。一九四二年年底，德国共产党、社会民主党、反希特勒的纳粹党人代表和各阶层人民的代表曾秘密举行全国反战运动大会。一九四三年六月以后这种运动更广泛的卷入了天主教徒、自由主义者、以及旧的政党。反战示威甚至举行于柏林城内，而“自由德国斗争委员会”竟在纳粹的老巢慕尼黑城中积极活动。一九四三年七月，德国被俘军人，许多政党的国会议员、省议员、职工会领袖和自由主义作家在莫斯科所组的“自由德国民族委员会”。更给今天新德国的成长奠下了基础。当希特勒快要崩溃的时候，德国人民也配合了盟军的进攻，在汉堡、布来梅、慕尼黑等地举行大暴动。
    从投降到现在，德国由苏美英法分别占领共同管制。
    在这四个占领区，德共及德国民主力量的发展，虽因苏美英法的政策不同而各异。然而各占领区的共产党、社会民主党、自由民主党与基督教民主党、却在投降后不久就缔成了反法西斯的人民统一战线，拟定了关于德国内政外交的共同行动纲领，包括肃清纳粹余毒、重建民主德国尽速恢复德国国民经济。
    全德的共产党员，由战前的三十五万发展到现在的六十七万、苏占领区的共产党于去年四月十三日与社会民主党合并，更名统一社会党。英美占领区的共产党又于今年二月与统一社会党统一行动，共组中央执行委员会。去年九月十五日全德大选时，统一社会党和英美法占领区的共产党共获六百三十余万票（如果加上英美法占领区的社会党左派力量，选举票共为九百六十余万票，占总票数三分之一强）。十一月间统一社会党并公布其德国宪法草案。在柏林市政府中，德共力量是强大的，保罗盛克是助理市长，玛格希克主持社会福利事业、教育与广播亦在德共主持之下。从四五年八月到四六年四月，柏林德共党员扩大一倍，达三万二千余人，成为柏林第一大党，在苏占区三个省中德共与社会党于四五年六月合组政府，德共党员伯尔利在布兰登堡省任第二副主席，柏格棱堡莱恩基任第一副主席，格萨堡任第三副主席。在萨克逊省，菲切尔任第一副主席，四六年该三省又成立统一的新政府，十二位部长中，共产党占五位。德共领袖巴特尔，主席皮克，副主席华尔特乌尔布利西的威望，已经成为台尔曼以后，德国人民的高山明灯了。
    在德共的领导下，德国的职工运动，也膨勃的发展，起先是在苏占领区，后来发展到英美法占领区，自由德国职工联合会，拥有会员数百万人。苏占区的农民，也在德共支持下翻了身，从一九四五年九月萨克逊尼亚省首先颁布土地改革法令起到同年十二月全苏占领区基本完成土地改革止：据中央农林业管理局的初步报告，即有七千个大地主被清算，二八一、九五三户农民（包括一部分移民）分得土地。作为德国法西斯主义与军国主义的农村基础，从此被打得粉碎。
    去年皮克所说的德共和德国民主力量奋斗的任务是：“清算纳粹主义与黩武主义，剥夺大地主大托拉斯财政资本的权势，清洗一切国家机构和地方自治政府中的纳粹分子，肃清教育和实业机关中的纳粹分子，惩办战争罪犯和纳粹领袖，推动重建德国经济，建立民主统一德国，与各国建立谅解的友谊”。这些任务虽然已经完成了一些；然而今天的形势还更多的需要德共和德国人民的努力，特别是美英法占领区的民主改革，没有强大的民主力量，是很难肃清美英法帝国主义分子所卵冀的法西斯残余的。
