Weekly Comprehensive War Report

　　The development of the war situation this week (February 23rd to March 1st) shows that after Chiang Kai-shek's major defeat in Shandong, he attempted a more adventurous attack on Yan'an. Chiang Kai-shek's plan to attack Yan'an this time was to use a surprise attack strategy, attempting to take Yan'an directly from the Yichuan line in the east. However, to confuse the People's Liberation Army, he first transferred four brigades of troops occupying the Guanzhong sub-district of the border region to invade Longdong in the west, and directed Liao Ang, the former commander of the eastern line stationed in Yijun, to advance westward, occupying Qingyang city in one day. But Chiang Kai-shek's main force for attacking Yan'an, the First Division and the Ninetieth Division, were secretly transferred westward from Shanxi, gathering in Yichuan. The Yan'an headquarters has exposed Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy.

　　The Luzhong Campaign was a shock to Chiang Kai-shek, because the 73rd Army was one of Chiang Kai-shek's few military trump cards. This time, along with other Chiang's troops in the north, a total of seven divisions and 50,000 men were completely wiped out in the Boshan and Laiwu areas on the 23rd. Li Xianshou, Han Jun, and others were captured, and the Chiang's troops under Wang Yaowu's command lost nearly half of their strength. The People's Liberation Army controlled the entire Zibo railway line and the western section of the Jiaoji Railway (more than a hundred miles from Yidu in the east to Zhoucun in the west). The Chiang's 8th Army in eastern Shandong was also forced to retreat, and more than a hundred miles of the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway between Yexian and Gaomi was also recovered on the 28th. The entire 15th Traffic Police Corps, equipped with American weapons, was wiped out, and the People's Liberation Army successively recovered ten county towns including Yexian, Boshan, Linzi, and Changshan.

　　After the Chiang's troops in southern Shandong occupied the empty city of Linyi, they dared not advance seeing the major defeat in Luzhong. Now they are dividing their forces to lean north along the Jinpu Railway towards Jinan. Chiang Kai-shek's painstaking efforts to concentrate troops in southern Shandong over the course of a month have now forced them to disperse again, and the temporary local advantage in southern Shandong will no longer exist.

　　In the Jilu豫 region, the battlefield in the past week has been in the southwestern Shandong region south of the old Yellow River. Wang Jingjiu's 5th Army, the 75th Division, and the 72nd Division, totaling about 80,000 men, invaded the vast area of southwestern Shandong, occupying empty cities such as Shanxian, Caoxian, and Dingtao. They originally wanted to fight against General Liu Bocheng's main force, but they did not find them. Because Mi Wenhe, Liu Ruzhen, Zhang Lanfeng and other units and their henchmen, such as the "Security Corps" and "Returning Home Corps," have long been annihilated or are incomplete, they have to disperse their forces to defend these empty cities and maintain supply lines. After a series of burdens were placed on them, the so-called "mobile troops" did not move much.

　　The war situation in the Northeast is beginning to change. The Democratic Allied Forces on the eastern front smashed the third offensive by Chiang's troops against the Linjiang area of ​​Andong Province, and successively recovered the three cities of Jinchuan, Liuhe, and Ji'an from March 25th to 28th; the western front recovered Kailu City in Rehe; the central route recovered Nong'an and Jiutai, two cities north of Changchun, from February 23rd to 26th. The recovery of Jiutai cut off the Jitai Railway.

　　In the past week, the People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 60,000 Chiang's troops and recovered 16 county towns - Xintai, Laiwu, Boshan, Zichuan, Changshan, Zouping, Yidu, Linzi, Yexian, and Changyi in Shandong, Ji'an, Jinchuan, Liuhe, Nong'an, and Jiutai in the Northeast, and Kailu in Rehe; the People's Liberation Army also voluntarily evacuated eight cities - Juye, Jiaxiang, Zou County, Qufu, and Qingyang in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.

### 我歼敌六万克县城十六座蒋军惨败之余图偷袭延安

专栏：一周综合战报

　　我歼敌六万克县城十六座蒋军惨败之余图偷袭延安
    本周（二月廿三日至三月一日）战局的发展，表现蒋介石在山东大败之后，企图更加冒险进攻延安。蒋介石这次向延安之进攻计划，是企图用突袭战略，欲由东线宜川一线直取延安。但为迷惑解放军计，先抽调侵占边区关中分区之军队四个旅西侵陇东，并由其前驻宜君之东线指挥官廖昂指挥西进，一日已侵占庆阳城。但是蒋介石进攻延安之主力第一师和第九十师等，却正秘密由山西西调，向宜川集结。延安总部已把蒋介石这一阴谋揭露了。
    鲁中会战对蒋介石是震动的，因为第七十三军是蒋介石有数的军事王牌之一，此次与其他北路蒋军共七个师五万人，二十三日在博山、莱芜地区全部覆没，李仙洲、韩浚等被俘，王耀武指挥下的蒋军损失近半。人民解放军控制了淄博铁路全线和胶济路西段（东起益都，西迄周村的百余里）。鲁东蒋军第八军亦被迫退却，掖县高密间胶济路东段百余里，也于二十八日被收复，美械的交通警察第十五总队全部被歼，解放军先后收复掖县、博山、临淄、长山等十座县城。
    鲁南蒋军至侵占临沂空城后，眼看鲁中大败不敢前进，现正分兵沿津浦路向北靠拢济南。蒋介石煞费心血历时经月集中到鲁南来的部队，如今又不得不分散开来，摆在鲁南的暂时的局部优势又将不存在了。
    冀鲁豫地区，一周来战场在旧黄河以南的鲁西南地区。王敬久的第五军第七十五师、第七十二师约八万之众，侵入鲁西南广大地区，侵占了单县、曹县、定陶等空城，本想找刘伯承将军的主力作战，但是他们却没有找到。因为米文和、刘汝珍、张岚峰等部和其爪牙“保安团”、“还乡团”等早已被歼灭或残缺不全了，他们不能不分散兵力据守这些空城和维持补给线，一连串的包袱背上后，所谓“机动部队”也不大活动了。
    东北战局正开始变化。东线民主联军，粉碎了蒋军第三次对安东省临江地区的攻势，于三月二十五至二十八日相继收复金川、柳河、辑安三城；西线收复热河之开鲁城；中路则自二月二十三日至二十六日间，收复长春以北之农安九台两城。九台收复，即切断了吉田铁路。
    本周内，人民解放军共歼蒋军六万多人，收复县城十六座——山东之新泰、莱芜、博山、淄川、长山、邹平、益都、临淄、掖县、昌邑，东北之辑安、金川、柳河、农安、九台及热河之开鲁；解放军又主动撤离八城——巨野、嘉祥、邹县、曲阜及陕甘宁边区之庆阳等。
