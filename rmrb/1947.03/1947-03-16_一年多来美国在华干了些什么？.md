What Has the United States Been Doing in China for More Than a Year?
　　Liao Gailong
    Since the Japanese surrender more than a year ago, what has American imperialism been doing in China? It has only done three things.
    The first thing is to instigate and aid Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war.
    In the past year, the United States has supplied Chiang Kai-shek with $4 billion worth of war materials and money.
    This included 1,150 airplanes, 471 ships, 67,000 various vehicles, as well as many tanks, artillery pieces, rocket launchers, chemical warfare equipment, ammunition, etc. These "materials" have caused millions of Chinese people to lose their lives in Chiang Kai-shek's initiation of the civil war!
    In the past year, the United States has desperately equipped and trained Chiang Kai-shek's army for the civil war. Until recently, the United States has equipped 64 divisions, 18 transportation corps, 20 security regiments, and a parachute battalion of Chiang's army, totaling 840,000 men. In the past year, the United States has trained 140,000 to 150,000 military personnel for Chiang Kai-shek in the navy, air force, infantry, artillery, engineering, logistics, automobile, communications, paratrooper, secret service, traffic police, staff, military doctor, and quartermaster fields. In addition to training Chiang's army, the United States still has a military advisory group of 4,000 to 5,000 members stationed in China for extended periods. In many battles in which Chiang Kai-shek attacked the Chinese liberated areas, such as the Battle of Panshan on January 17th last year and the Battle of Changli Hongqiao on February 5th, they were directly led and supervised by American officers.
    In the past year, the United States transported 14 corps and 8 transportation corps of Chiang's army, totaling approximately 540,000 men, to the civil war front.
    Not only that, but the United States also directly participated in Chiang Kai-shek's attacks on the liberated areas. After the Japanese surrender, the United States dispatched 110,000 ground troops, more than 150 airplanes, and over 200 warships to Nanjing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Qinhuangdao, and other places to help Chiang Kai-shek seize these cities and seaports surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, and to occupy and garrison the Beining Railway. By July 1946, American troops had directly attacked the liberated areas in more than 30 incidents, deploying 2,300 troops, which together with the Chiang's puppet troops they led, totaled 4,800 men. American aircraft made countless incursions into the liberated areas, and the American Navy once invaded the waters off Yantai, issuing an ultimatum to force the People's Liberation Army to withdraw from Yantai.
    Particularly shameful was the fact that the United States ordered Japanese bandits to help Chiang Kai-shek fight against the People's Liberation Army that was accepting the surrender. As soon as Japan surrendered last August, MacArthur ordered the invading Japanese army in China to surrender only to Chiang Kai-shek. Marshall and MacArthur also agreed to send a large number of Japanese officers to China to serve as instructors for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war army.
    In the past year, Marshall came to China to "mediate" in the Chinese civil war, and the result of the "mediation" was a comprehensive and unprecedented large-scale civil war. After Marshall came to China, violating the ceasefire order, he transported nine corps of Chiang's army to the civil war front, prior to which only five corps had been transported; after Marshall came to China, he equipped 25 divisions of Chiang's army and bought time, covering up Chiang Kai-shek's increase of troops attacking the liberated areas from one million to two million. Regarding the truth about Marshall's "mediation," the authoritative liberal publication in Shanghai, *The Weekly Review*, pointed out: Marshall's initial task in China was to freeze the military situation within the passes, so that Chiang Kai-shek could develop toward the Northeast. When Chiang Kai-shek attacked the Northeast, Marshall flew back to the United States. After Marshall came to China again, he adopted a "hands-off attitude" toward the civil war in the Northeast. It was not until the 184th Division revolted in Haicheng against the civil war and the situation became unfavorable to Chiang Kai-shek that Marshall resumed his activities. "When Xuanhuaidian was in imminent danger, Marshall did not say a word, but when Li Xiannian's army reached Xiangfan and might enter Sichuan and Shaanxi, Marshall quickly sent an executive group to mediate and stop them."
    The above facts illustrate that the Chinese civil war was "aided" by the United States, and its scale was unprecedentedly expanded with the "mediation" of the United States. The British magazine *New Statesman* said it completely accurately: "The American President has in fact become the supreme commander of the Kuomintang army."
    The second thing the United States has done in China in the past year is to consolidate Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship and help him trample on democracy.
    First of all, the United States' support for Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale civil war is essentially to strangle China's democracy by attacking the democratic liberated areas. All the measures taken by Chiang Kai-shek in his occupied areas prove that the purpose of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war is to undermine the free land system of the liberated areas, restore the feudal land system, destroy the democratic political and economic system of the liberated areas, and implement the restoration of the feudal baojia system and the feudal comprador-bureaucrat capital rule. In a word, the United States wants to help Chiang Kai-shek stifle the embryo of a new democratic China.
    American imperialism gives direct and indirect support to all the autocratic and dark facilities of Chiang Kai-shek in its ruling areas. In February, before the ink on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference was dry, the American reactionaries hinted that Chiang Kai-shek should launch a fascist anti-Soviet and anti-Communist movement in various places as an excuse to tear up all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. At that time, as recorded in *The Weekly Review* in Shanghai, "American Secretary of State Byrnes opportunely issued an anti-Soviet statement in distant echo." Since then, hundreds and thousands of atrocities that crushed freedom of speech and various democratic rights have broken out one after another, all the way to supporting Chiang Kai-shek in convening his hand-picked bogus "National Assembly" and creating a bogus constitution. The United States also retrained the heinous Chiang gang secret agents. The US and Chiang jointly established the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," and set up secret agent training classes everywhere, with the slogan: "Establish a German Gestapo-style secret police and SS with Chinese-style spirit and American-style technology."
    In the past year, the atrocities of American troops stationed in China killing and insulting our compatriots and raping our women have emerged in endlessly. In the one year from September 1945, in Shanghai alone, 1,866 of our compatriots were killed or injured by the atrocities of American troops, not including the number of people who were raped and insulted.
    The facts show that the United States is the culprit that promotes Chiang Kai-shek and crushes Chinese democracy together with Chiang Kai-shek. Is there any doubt about this?
    The third thing the United States has done in China in the past year is to infringe upon China's sovereignty by various means and turn China into its own colony. This is also the general purpose of American imperialism's aggression against China, which, separately speaking, is:
    1. With Chiang Kai-shek's "consent," the United States occupied large cities, railways, and seaports, and acquired naval and air bases in places such as Qingdao. According to the Chiang-US Commercial Treaty, the United States was allowed to invade Chinese airspace for flight photography. In the *Sino-US Commercial Treaty* publicly signed on November 4, the United States obtained the right to invade and dock warships in any Chinese seaport; in the *Sino-US Air Force Agreement* signed on December 20, the United States also obtained the right to land "non-traffic" military flights in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and locations that "may be agreed upon at any time in the future." Therefore, the United States has completely undermined China's territorial, territorial sea, and airspace sovereignty, and Chiang-controlled China has become an American military base.
    2. In the past year, cheap American goods have been dumped into our country in a flood. After the *Sino-US Commercial Treaty* and the *Air Transport Agreement* were signed, American merchant ships could further control China's treaty ports, customs, and trade, control sea, land, and air transportation routes and communications, and destroy our country's national industry. China has become a monopoly market for American goods.
    3. In the past year, the United States has intervened in and gradually controlled China's petroleum, lead, antimony, tungsten, tin, electricity, power, sea, land, and air transportation, etc.; after the *Sino-US Commercial Treaty* was signed, "all Chinese territories are open to the American business community" (according to Gu Weijun, ambassador of the Chiang government to the United States), the United States can further use its abundant capital and advanced technology to directly mine and establish factories in China, taking advantage of our country's cheap labor. China has become a monopoly investment site for American financial oligarchs.
    4. American goods are dumped into our country on an unprecedented scale (in the first half of last year, the United States' surplus over China was more than 200 million yuan). Through the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Chen, and Kong, a comprador network has been gradually established in our country from towns to remote areas, and through the low exchange rate stipulated by the Chiang government, the vast number of Chinese farmers are exploited through unequal exchange, and Chinese agriculture is gradually forced to submit to its needs. The American agricultural inspection team has also formulated a "broad plan" to control Chinese agricultural products, primarily tung oil, wool, silk, etc., which will soon be implemented to realize "agricultural China, industrial America," making China a monopoly raw material supply site for American imperialism.
    5. Through $4 billion in loans to Chiang, the United States has controlled the entire Chiang government's finance and choked the throat of the entire Chiang-controlled China.
    6. The extraterritoriality that the United States had in our country before the war has been transformed and revived due to the privileges of American troops stationed in China, UNRRA personnel, and the establishment of the "Sino-US Commercial Arbitration Committee." American advisors are common in various departments of the Chiang government; Chiang Kai-shek's army is trained, designed, and advised on tactical plans by Americans...
    More than a year ago, President Truman declared that he wanted to make China an "independent," "peaceful," and "democratic" country. But the facts over the past year have proven how hypocritical and shameful this statement is! Last December, President Truman reiterated his statement from a year ago, saying that he would "not interfere in China's internal affairs" and that he wanted China to achieve "peace" and "democracy." American imperialists are really deceiving people too much. Today, only a madman would believe this kind of nonsense!
    After more than a year of lessons, the Chinese people have deeply understood how serious the new national crisis facing them is. Facts have proven that the Chinese people cannot be conquered. Chiang Kai-shek plus American imperialism will not work. Over the past year, the Chinese People's Liberation Army's patriotic self-defense war has annihilated a large number of invading troops of traitors. The patriotic democratic movement and anti-Chiang people's uprisings have swept the country, which proves that the Chinese people are advancing toward victory.
    If the US authorities do not change course, then the fall of Japanese imperialism is a lesson from the past.

　　一年多来美国在华干了些什么？
    廖盖隆
    自日本投降后一年多来，美国帝国主义在中国做了些什么呢？它只做了三件事。
    第一件是指使和援助蒋介石打内战。
    一年多来，美国以四十亿美元的作战物资与金钱供给了蒋介石。
    其中包括飞机一千一百五十架，舰船四百七十一艘，各种车六万七千辆以及许多坦克、大炮、火箭炮、化学战具、弹药等。这些“物资”，已使上百万中国人在蒋介石发动内战中丧失其生命！
    一年多来，美国拚命装备、训练打内战的蒋介石军队。迄最近止，美国已装备了蒋军六十四个师、十八个交通总队、二十个保安团及伞兵大队，共计八十四万人。一年多来美国训练了蒋介石的海、空、步、炮、工、辎、汽车、通讯、伞兵、特务、交通警察、参谋、军医、军需等军事人员，共计十四万到十五万人。美国除训练蒋军外，尚有四五千人的军事顾问团员长留中国。而在蒋介石进攻中国解放区的许多战役，例如去年一月十七日的盘山之战役以及二月五日的昌黎虹桥之战中，直接由美国军官率领及督战。
    一年多来美国运了蒋军十四个军，八个交通总队，共约五十四万人，进入打内战的阵地。
    不仅如此，美国还直接参与蒋介石对解放区的进攻，日本投降后美国曾派遣了十一万的陆上部队，一百五十架以上的飞机、二百余艘军舰，进驻南京、上海、青岛、天津、北平、秦皇岛等地，帮助蒋介石侵占这些解放军所包围的城市、海港，并侵占和守驻北宁路。到一九四六年七月止，美军直接进攻解放区的事件共达三十余次，出动兵力二千三百人，与其带领之蒋伪军合计则为四千八百人。美国飞机对解放区作无数次的袭扰，美国海军曾侵入烟台海面，以最后通牒迫令解放军退出烟台。
    特别可耻的，就是美国命令日寇帮助蒋介石对受降的解放军作战。去年八月日本一投降，麦克阿瑟就命令侵华日军只能向蒋介石投降。马歇尔、麦克阿瑟还商妥派遣大批日本军官来华，充作蒋介石内战军队的教练。
    一年来，马歇尔来华对中国内战作了“调处”，而“调处”的结果是一个全面的空前的大内战。马歇尔来华后，违犯停战令的规定，运了蒋军九个军进入内战的火线，在此前，尚只运了五个军；马歇尔来华后装备了蒋军二十五个师，并争取了时间，掩护蒋介石把进攻解放区的军队从一百万人增加到二百万人。关于马歇尔“调处”的真相，上海权威的自由主义刊物《周报》曾指出：马歇尔初来华的任务，是把关内的军事态势冻结起来，使蒋介石可以向关外发展。当蒋介石进攻东北时，马歇尔飞回了美国。马歇尔再度来华后，对东北内战则采取“袖手旁观态度”。直到一八四师在海城起义反对内战，形势对蒋介石不利，马歇尔才恢复了活动。“当宣化店岌岌可危时，马歇尔没有说一句话，但当李先念军冲到襄樊，可能入川入陕之际，马歇尔就赶快派执行小组来调处阻止了。”
    上面这些事实说明了：中国的内战是美国“援助”出来的，其规模则随着美国的“调处”而空前扩大起来。英国《新政治家》杂志说得完全确切：“美国总统实际上成了国民党军队的最高统帅。”
    一年多来美国在华所做的第二件事，就是巩固蒋介石的法西斯独裁，帮助他蹂躏民主。
    首先，美国支持蒋介石大打内战，本质上即是通过向民主的解放区的进攻来扼死中国的民主。蒋介石在其侵占区的一切措施证明了：蒋介石内战的目的就是要破坏解放区的自由土地制度，使封建土地制度复辟，摧毁解放区的民主的政治和经济制度，实行封建保甲制度与封建买办官僚资本统制的复辟。一句话，美国要帮助蒋介石窒死新民主中国的胚胎。
    美国帝国主义对蒋介石在其统治地区的一切专制黑暗设施给以直接间接的支持。二月间，政协决议墨迹未干，美国反动派即暗示蒋介石在各地发动反苏反共的法西斯运动，作为撕毁全部政协决议的借口，当时情形，正如上海《周报》所记载的：“美国国务卿贝纳斯曾适时发表反苏声明遥相呼应”。从此以后，就接连爆发千百次摧残言论及各种民主权利的暴行，一直到支持蒋介石召开其一手包办的伪“国大”制造伪宪法。美国还重新训练了万恶的蒋帮特务。美蒋合办了“中美合作所”，在各地遍设特务训练班，其口号为：“以中国式精神，美国式技术，建立德国盖斯塔波式秘密警察和党卫军”。
    一年多来，驻华美军杀害、殴辱我们同胞，强奸我们妇女的暴行，更层出无穷。从一九四五年九月起一年间，仅上海一地，我同胞死伤于美军暴行者，即达一千八百六十六人，被强奸、侮辱的人数还不在内。
    事实说明了：美国乃是推动蒋介石，及和蒋介石一起摧残中国民主的罪魁。这难道还有疑问吗？
    一年多来美国在华所做的第三件事，就是用各色各样的办法侵害中国的主权，变中国为它自己的殖民地。这也就是美帝国主义侵华的总目的，分开来说，就是：
    一、根据蒋介石的“同意”美国占驻了大城市、铁路与海港，取得了青岛等处的海空基地。根据蒋美商约，美国被准许侵入中国全部领空飞行拍影。在十一月四日公开签订的《中美商约》中、美国取得了以军舰侵入并停泊在中国任何海港之权；在十二月二十日签订的《中美空军协定》中，美国又取得了在上海、天津、广州及“今后随时同意”的地点，“非交通的”军事飞行的降落权。因此，美国已把中国的领土、领海、领空主权全部破坏，蒋管中国已成为美国的军事基地。
    二、一年来廉价美货已滚滚倾销我国。《中美商约》和《空运协定》签订后美国商船更可控制中国的通商口岸、海关和贸易，控制海上、陆上和空中的运输道路和交通事业，摧毁了我国的民族工业。中国已成为美货的独占市场。
    三、一年来美已插足并逐步控制了中国的石油、铅、锑、钨、锡、电气、电力、海、陆、空交通事业等等；《中美商约》签立后，“中国全部领土均对美国工商界开放”（蒋政府驻美大使顾维钧语），美国便更得以挟其雄厚资本与高度技术，利用我国廉价劳动力，在华直接开矿、设厂。中国已成为美国金融寡头的独占投资场所。
    四、美货以空前规模（去年上半年美对我出超在二亿元以上）倾销我国，经过蒋、宋、陈、孔四大家，在我国逐步建立了从城镇到僻壤的买办网，并经过蒋政府所规定的低汇率，以不等价交换剥削中国广大农民，并逐步迫使中国农业服从其需要。美国农业考察团且已拟定控制中国农产，首先是桐油、羊毛、丝等的“广大计划”，并即将实施，实现“农业中国，工业美国”，使中国成为美帝国主义独占的原料供应场。
    五、经过四十亿美元的对蒋借贷，美国已控制了整个蒋政府的金融、财政，扼住了整个蒋管中国的咽喉。
    六、战前美国对我国的领事裁判权，已因驻华美军，联总人员之特权，以及中美商事公断委员会”的设立，而变相复活。美国顾问普遍于蒋政府的各部门；蒋介石军队均由美国人训练并设计及建议战术计划………。
    一年多以前，杜鲁门总统曾经声明，要使中国成为“独立”、“和平”、“民主”的国家。但一年多来的事实证明这一声明是何等虚伪与可耻！去年十二月杜鲁门总统却又重申其一年前的声明，说要“不干涉中国内政”，要使中国得到“和平”、“民主”。美帝国主义者实在欺人太甚了。今天除非是疯子，才会相信这一套鬼话！
    中国人民经过一年多的教训，已经深刻了解摆在自己面前的新民族危机是何等严重，实事证明，中国人民是不可能被征服的，蒋介石加上美国帝国主义并不顶事，一年多来，中国人民解放军的爱国自卫战争，已歼灭了大量的卖国贼进犯军，爱国民主运动与抗蒋民变，已磅礴全国，这证明了中国人民正向胜利前进。
    美国当局不改弦易辙，那么日本帝国主义覆亡，即是前车之鉴。
