Commander Liu Cares About the People's Emancipation
	Rang Mingde
	I have been working under the direct leadership of General Liu Bocheng for seven years, but I rarely see him except in meetings. In the seven months since the beginning of the Self-Defense War, I often went to him for instructions. Now, recalling a few things, I write them down below, which may be helpful to readers.

	Always Concerned About the People
	Whenever he arrives in a place, he always takes time out from his busy schedule to inquire about the living conditions of the masses; especially whether the land issue has been resolved, the relationship between the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army and the people, and the attitude of the people towards us, as a basis for his instructions and to promote the civil affairs work of the troops. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, a very common cry among the young people joining the army everywhere is: "I don't want to go anywhere else, I want to be a soldier of General Liu Bocheng. Please tell General Liu Bocheng that we will definitely work hard." Due to the frequent wars and constant victories, the troops have been constantly replenished with new forces. However, some of these people are farmers, and some have just been liberated from the Chiang Kai-shek army, so they do not understand the rules of the Eighth Route Army, and therefore some behaviors that harm the interests of the masses have occurred. I was then tasked with refunding and compensating the masses. In Lizhi Village and Dazhutan, the local people were moved and said: "Please tell the Liu-Deng leaders, rest assured! We will definitely work well and strive to support the front."

	The People Are Our Lifeline
	Since the beginning of the New Year, the troops have recovered vast areas of lost territory. In order to enable the masses in the recovered areas to quickly turn over a new leaf, a large number of emancipation teams have been organized. The guards who have followed General Liu Bocheng for many years have also participated in the work of the emancipation team. When Guard Kang Li bid farewell to General Liu, General Liu took the time to have a thirty-minute conversation with Comrade Kang Li, encouraging Comrade Kang Li to serve the people, and giving detailed instructions on his working methods, etc. When Comrade Kang Li returned to the emancipation team and told everyone about this, all the comrades in the emancipation team felt very honored, and everyone unanimously expressed their determination: if the work is not done well, we will be sorry for our Commander Liu.

	Checking at Any Time to Achieve Implementation
	After the emancipation teams were formed, Commander Liu personally went to the front to direct the battle. When he came back later, I went to ask for instructions. As soon as we met, General Liu asked me with a smile, "Do you know how the work has been these days? How many villages are there in this county? How much land and population are there in total?" I immediately reported to him what I knew. Commander Liu then asked: "Why was the meeting you held in ×× village that day not successful? Is the work in ×× and ×× now seemingly better?" I told him that because the first meeting was not successful, the method was changed. First, we went deep into the villages to understand the situation, selected objects, combined the emancipation teams with the combat troops, concentrated our efforts on the central villages, created experience, and then promoted it to various villages. After reporting these situations, Commander Liu said: "Very good, this has not only mobilized the masses, but also united the local cadres, and made the relationship between the army and the people even closer." After this incident, I thought that the troops have to fight, and of course Commander Liu is busier than ever, but he still often guides our work. If our commanders at all levels were like this, not only would the civil affairs work be successful, but all political work would naturally be done better. Of course, our commanders at all levels are learning from our teacher - Commander Liu.

### 刘司令员关心人民翻身

　　刘司令员关心人民翻身
    穰明德
    我在刘伯承将军直接领导下工作已经七年了，但除开会外却常不见面。自卫战争开始的七个月中，我是经常去领教的，现在回忆起几件事情，写在下面，对读者或许有点帮助。
    时刻关心着人民
    每到一地，他都是在百忙中抽时间探询群众的生活状况；特别是土地问题是否解决，民主政府与人民解放军对人民的关系，及人民对我们的态度，以作他指示和推动部队做民运工作的依据。在冀鲁豫区，各地青年参军中很普遍的呼声是：“那里我都不去，要就当刘伯承将军的兵，请你告诉刘伯承将军我们一定努力工作。”由于战争的频繁和不断的大捷，因此部队不断补充了新的力量。但这些人有的是农民，有的新从蒋军解放过来，因而对八路军的规矩不懂，所以发生些损害群众利益的行为。我当时受领任务向群众退款与赔偿。在礼直集和大渚潭，当地群众都感动的说：“请你告诉刘邓首长，放心吧！我们一定很好工作，努力支援前线。”
    人民是我们的命根
    新春以来，部队收复广大失地，为使收复区群众迅速翻身，组织了大批翻身队。跟刘伯承将军多年的警卫员，也参加了翻身队工作。当警卫员康礼同志向刘将军告别时，刘将军即抽出时间与康礼同志作三十分钟的谈话，鼓励康礼同志为人民服务，并谆谆指示其工作方法等。当康礼同志回到翻身队，把这件事告诉大家时，翻身队全体同志感到非常荣幸，大家一致都表示决心：如工作做不好，就对不起我们的刘司令员。
    随时检查以求贯彻
    翻身队组成后，刘司令员亲自到前线指挥作战去了。等以后回来时，我就去请示。当我一见面，刘将军就满面笑容地问我：“你知道这几天工作怎样？这个县有若干村？共有多少土地和人口？”我当即将我所了解的情况汇报给他听。刘司令员又问：“你那天在××村召开会议，为什么未开好？现在××、××工作似乎好一些吧？”我告诉他，因为第一次未开好，就改变了方式，先深入各村了解情况，选择对象，翻身队与作战军相结合，集中力量到中心村，创造经验后，再推广到各村。把这些情况报告后，刘司令员就说：“很好，这样既发动了群众，又团结了当地干部，更亲密了军民关系”。从这一件事情后，我想部队要作战，刘司令员当然是再忙也没有了，但他还经常指导我们的工作。如果我们各级指挥员都这样的话，不仅民运工作有成绩，全部政治工作也自然会作得更好。当然，我们的各级指挥员，都是在学习着我们的老师——刘司令员的。
