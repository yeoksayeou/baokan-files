[Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan office on the 16th] More than a thousand officers and soldiers of the Chiang army, ranging from school-level to lieutenant-level, who laid down their weapons before the southern campaign in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region's Training Regiment, have launched a wave of complaints in recent days, accusing the bloody rule of the four major families. Before the accusations, the students were first relieved of their embarrassment in complaining and their thoughts of blaming their own fate. They then automatically convened accusation meetings, vying to make accusations. Zhang Yuzhang, a warrant officer and special affairs chief of the 87th Regiment of the 29th Brigade of the 55th Division of Chiang's army, painfully recounted how his parents lost twelve acres of land because they borrowed four dou of sorghum from the landlord and were unable to repay it. Later, after borrowing two more dou of sorghum, the landlord demolished three tiled houses, forcing them to move to a temple. His father stole the village chief's wheat seedlings due to hunger and was robbed of his only remaining property – a table and a water tank. His older brother was assassinated for saying a few angry words, causing his mother to fall ill in bed… At this point, tears were streaming down his face, and he choked with sobs, covering his face and weeping. After a while, he finally managed to hold back his tears and said, choking: when he received a letter from home and rushed home, he only saw a pile of rubble in front of the door. His mother fainted immediately upon seeing him. At this point, Comrade Zhang could no longer restrain himself and burst into tears, causing sighs of sorrow throughout the audience.

Zeng Rongzheng, a former lieutenant platoon leader of the 6th Company of the 366th Regiment of the 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division of Chiang's army, tearfully recounted how his white-haired old mother was beaten with a cane for resisting the oppression of Zhang Jiucheng's younger brother, the captain of Xinjin County, Sichuan; his nephew's wife was raped by Zhang; and his father, eldest brother, second brother, and uncle were all killed. He was forced to leave home to become a soldier. Finally, he exclaimed with tears in his eyes: "I never want to go back to that dark society in my life, the liberated area is my home!" Zhang Zhenju, a former quartermaster sergeant (formerly a lieutenant platoon leader) of the 55th Division of Chiang's army, accused that in Chiang's army, due to disagreement in words, he aroused the private hatred of the company commander, often suffered beatings, and was attempted to be shot three times under false pretenses. Wang Zhikuan recounted that in a certain company of the 6th Replenishment Training Center, more than seventy new recruits died of starvation and illness within a year due to the company commander's corruption. After death, they were thrown into the suburbs to be devoured by wild dogs, and the seriously ill were buried alive. The rule of the Chiang family is sinful, and the painful past cannot be fully recounted. In recent days, each team has published "Our Accusations" and wall newspaper special issues. Comrade Zhang Qingshuo of the Second Team also drew "A Blood and Tears Map of the Chiang-Controlled Area," depicting the hellish life in the Chiang-controlled areas.
