Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jìn Chá Jì] (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region) 6th Dispatch: Our correspondent reports on the Jidong (East Hebei) water region bloodbath caused by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, noting: The Chiang Kai-shek troops, the 425th and 426th Regiments of the 142nd Division of the 92nd Army, and the 168th Regiment of the 56th Division in the area, a total of three regiments, suddenly invaded the water region on the 2nd of last month. Engaging in rape, arson, and murder, they looted over fifty towns and villages in three days, arresting and massacring over one hundred and fifty young men and women. In villages such as Shijiowo in Yutian County, many women were raped and then regretted [being alive], and a three-month-old infant in Damicang, Shidi [probably should be Jidi] was starved to death. Preliminary statistics show that 6,080 houses were burned, and over 2,054 households, totaling more than 10,000 people, were left without food or clothing. The local people's government is now actively engaged in relief efforts.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jìn Chá Jì] (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region) 7th Dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek's planes recently caused a major tragedy in Yu (玉, Jade) County, unprecedented in the area in the eight years since the Anti-Japanese War. On the 28th of last month, during a local temple fair, two Chiang Kai-shek planes suddenly came and strafed wildly, killing twenty-five people on the spot and wounding one hundred and twenty-two. The market was covered in blood. Wang Dingzi's father, a victim from Shangzhuang, held up a kitchen knife and said, "Chiang Kai-shek killed my son, I will risk my old life to fight him." Our Party and government cadres immediately expressed condolences to the families of the victims and quickly sent the injured to the hospital for treatment.
