    Taiyue Fourth Military Sub-district Expanded Cadre Meeting Decides to Combine War Effort Review with Production
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Taiyue, 27th] The Fourth Military Sub-district convened an expanded cadre meeting to summarize the land reform movement in the entire region. It started on the 1st of this month and ended on the 21st. In the past year, the Fourth Military Sub-district has undergone three stages in the mass movement: anti-traitors and despots, rent reduction and debt liquidation, and the complete overturning of the old order. The last stage was the climax of the mass movement in the entire region. From last November to the present, according to incomplete statistics from six counties, including Gaoping, Yangcheng, Shimin, Jincheng, Wangwu, and Jiyuan, the peasants have recovered more than 280,000 mu of land, 77,000 rooms, nearly 50,000 cave dwellings, 822,000 shi of grain, 14,000 livestock, and a large number of clothes, utensils, and silver ingots. The ultra-poor have been eliminated, and the poor peasants have risen in status. According to statistics from 108 villages in three counties, the ultra-poor received an average of 2.9 mu of land per person, the poor peasants received an average of 2.5 mu of land per person, the middle peasants received an average of 3.3 mu of land per person after the distribution, and the well-to-do middle peasants received an average of 4.66 mu of land per person after the distribution. After the peasants received the land, their level of awareness was unprecedentedly improved, and they actively demanded to be organized to defend Chairman Mao and to defend the fruits of their labor by armed force. The Jincheng Peasants' Association has developed to 90,000 members, accounting for 30% of the county's population. The militia in the entire region has more than doubled in size.
    The meeting also summarized the experiences and lessons learned in implementing policies. First of all, regarding the policy towards middle peasants, the following problems still exist from the perspective of the entire region: 1. In villages where there were no landlords or rich peasants or where feudal elements had already been investigated, landless and land-poor peasants were still targeting middle peasants to get land. 2. Some former bandits and secret agents among the middle peasants were inadvertently purged in the process of "washing faces and blackening" (being wrongly accused). 3. A small number of middle peasants who had lent small amounts of money were also treated as feudal remnants to be cut off. 4. There was a belief that as long as the blow did not exceed 10%, it would not matter if individual cases were slightly excessive. 5. Middle peasants who lacked labor were mobilized to voluntarily contribute land. The meeting finally determined that the future direction and tasks are to combine the war effort review with production: (1) Strengthen military construction, realize that the local areas take care of the troops, and the rear takes care of the front, and establish permanent organizations for participation in the war. (2) Combine production with thorough review; for villages with serious problems, focus on investigating feudal elements, and generally promote production.

    太岳四分区扩干会决定
    战争复查生产结合进行
    【本报太岳二十七日电】四分区召开干部扩大会议，总结全区土地改革运动。从本月一日开始至二十一日结束。四分区在一年来的群众运动中，曾经过反奸霸，减租清债反总清算齐翻身运动三个时期，而最后一个时期则是全区群众运动的最高潮。从去年十一月至现在，据高平、阳城、士敏、晋城、王屋、济源等六县的不完全统计；农民收回土地二十八万余亩、房屋七万七千余间、窑洞近五万孔、粮食八十二万二千余石、牲口一万四千余头及衣服用具元宝等甚多。赤贫消灭，贫农上升。据三个县一百零八个村庄的统计：赤贫分得土地每人平均二亩九分、贫农分得土地每人平均二亩五分、中农分得土地后，每人平均三亩三分、富裕中农分得土地后，每人平均四亩六分六厘。农民分得土地后，觉悟程度空前提高，积极要求组织起来，保卫毛主席，武装保卫果实。晋城农会会员已发展达九万人，占全县人口百分之卅。全区民兵发展一倍以上。
    会议中并总结了执行政策的经验与教训。首先是对中农政策从全区来看，还有以下的问题：一、没有地主富农或封建已查完的村庄，无地少地的农民仍未得到土地，便找到了中农头上。二、中农成份的一些伪匪人员，在“洗脸擦黑”中，无形中被清算了。三、少数中农放过小账亦被当作封建尾巴去割。四、认为只要打击而不超过百分之十，个别动一点亦不要紧。五、缺乏劳力的中农便动员其自愿献田。会议最后确定今后方针任务是战争复查与生产结合：（一）加强军事建设，实现地方照顾部队、后方照顾前方，建立经常的参战组织。（二）结合生产贯彻复查；问题严重的村庄，重点放在追查封建，一般推动生产。
