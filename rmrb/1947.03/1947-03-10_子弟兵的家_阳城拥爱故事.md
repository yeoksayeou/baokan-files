　　　　More Convenient Than Being at Home
　　In late November last year, the people of Shangxia Zhuangtou (Upper and Lower Zhuang Villages) in the first district of Yangcheng were carrying out a leveling and replenishment campaign. Suddenly, they heard the news that the Eighth Route Army was coming to be stationed there, and the whole village jumped up excitedly. Guo Fusheng, the village militia instructor, said, "Our village people have land to cultivate, houses to live in, and food and clothing, all thanks to the Eighth Route Army's sacrifices and bloodshed. Now that the army is coming to be stationed in our village, what do you think we should do to treat them well?" Zhang Shuidi, a woman, said, "I want to sweep my good house clean and lay out felt and mats." Sun Xiaogou also said, "No matter what, we have to let the troops sleep on the kang (heated brick bed)." After discussion, in order not to affect the land reform, a reception team was organized, and each family sent bowls, chopsticks, basins, and all furniture to the reception team.
　　Early the next morning, the entire village lined up, beating drums and gongs, waiting on the main road of Shangzhuang. By the afternoon, they discovered that a neat formation was approaching from the Xiazhuang path. As soon as the lookout reported, the crowd surged towards the troops. Guo Fusheng and Guo Fengting, who were leading, grabbed the horses of the battalion commander and political instructor, saying, "We have been preparing for a long time, quickly come home and rest!" As soon as the soldiers entered the houses, it was like entering a new home. The stove was burning hot, and the kettle was steaming. The neat kangs and beds were all covered with felt, blankets, mats, and straw. The tables and chairs were wiped clean and bright, and the windows were papered snow-white. Each family had a certain number of people to take care of the soldiers. The reception team distributed the prepared furniture to each squad, with everything available. The commanders were so moved that they said, "This is more convenient than being back in our own homes." The next morning, as soon as they got up, the villagers, with gongs and drums, entered the battalion headquarters. Everyone brought gifts, like celebrating a lively Lantern Festival. People circled around the yard and stopped in front of the battalion commander's house. Guo Fusheng and Guo Fengting entered the battalion commander's house. Before they could speak, Guo Fusheng said, "The common people have come to offer a little token of appreciation." The masses immediately rushed to put down their things, causing the political instructor to repeatedly express his thanks. The reception team also organized all the village's livestock to haul coal and buy vegetables for the troops in the city.

　　　　The People's Sincerity Consolidated the Troops
　　Feng Suojin, a machine gun squad soldier, went to his landlord Guan Shunma's house to borrow scissors. Guan Shunma hurriedly jumped off the kang, opened the cabinet, and took out a fried dough stick and a pair of scissors. "My child, eat this dough stick before you go!" Suojin refused to eat and ran away with the scissors. The old lady chased him to the door and grabbed him: "You must eat this one! You have been running around for our liberation, unable to eat a peaceful meal, you must eat it! You must eat it!" She forcefully stuffed it into his hand.
　　The next day, the machine gun squad was holding a squad meeting when the old lady brought in a basket of fried dough sticks. "Comrades, don't mind if it's not good, eat it while you're meeting!" After saying that, she put it down and left. Feng Suojin was so moved that he said to all the comrades in the squad: "Comrades! The old lady is so good to us, what should we do after eating it?" One soldier suggested launching a "full water jar" movement for all the villagers and striving for victory to protect the people's fruits of liberation. Jin Qunsheng, a liberated soldier from the Meng County battle, usually liked to complain. This time, he confessed: "In the past, I heard about serving the people, but I didn't know who it was for. Today, I truly realize that the people are like this old lady. I will be determined to do a good job." Many liberated soldiers were moved to tears by the sincere hospitality of the villagers. The troops were stationed for seven days, and all the water jars in the village were filled to the brim. When the troops were about to depart, each family prepared good food to invite the troops to eat, and each company also prepared food to invite the landlords, making it a close-knit family. Everyone's satchel was filled with gifts from the villagers—dry rations and persimmon cakes. The battle of Yuanqu began, and the soldiers took out the dry rations and persimmons given by the villagers from their pockets to eat. Wang Dongsheng, a rifle squad soldier, said: "Eating the villagers' sweet persimmons increases the energy for fighting."

　　　　Why Not Station in Our Village
　　After the Battle of Yuanqu, when the people of Shangxia Zhuangtou heard that the troops were returning, they cleaned up their houses as they had before, waiting for them. When the militia members who participated in the battle returned to the village, they learned that they were stationed in Nanciying. The old men, children, and women wondered why they didn't come back. Fortunately, Duan Xueying, the political instructor of the Sixth Company, returned and passed by Shangxia Zhuangtou and was seen by the masses, who immediately pulled him into the village and asked him why he didn't bring the troops to Shangxia Zhuangtou to be stationed. After the instructor explained, they sent representatives with gifts to Nanciying to visit the troops.

　　　　The People's Soldiers' Home
　　The old year arrived, and each platoon and squad made New Year cards for their respective landlords in Shangxia Zhuangtou and sent them on the first day of the Lunar New Year. They said in the letter: "We are training intensely and cannot go home for the New Year. All the comrades in the battalion extend New Year's greetings to all the elders and brothers, and wish everyone a Happy New Year." On the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, the people of Shangxia Zhuangtou sent representatives again, carrying a lot of pork and eggs to see them and to comfort the wounded and sick. On the Lantern Festival, the brigade headquarters, in order to thank the people of Shangxia Zhuangtou for their care and love for the people's soldiers, sent a large banner to Shangxia Zhuangtou with five distinct characters written on it—"The People's Soldiers' Home."

　　子弟兵的家
    ——阳城拥爱故事
             比在自己家里还方便
    去年十一月底，阳城一区上下庄头老百姓正在进行着填平补齐运动，忽听得八路军要来驻的消息，马上全村的人都兴奋的跳起来。村里民兵指导员郭福生说：“咱村的人都有地种、有房住、有吃穿了，都是八路军流血牺牲打来的，今天军队要来村驻，大家说应该怎么招待？”妇女张水弟说：“我要把家里好房扫干净，铺上毡和席。”孙小狗也说：“不论怎样，总得叫队伍在炕上睡。”讨论到最后，为了不影响土地改革，组织了一个招待股，各家把碗筷盆一切家具送到招待股。
    头一天早上，全村人们排着队打着锣鼓在上庄大路上等，到下午才发现整齐的队伍由下庄小道过来了，瞭望哨一报告，人群向着队伍拥去，领头的郭福生、郭凤廷拉住营长、指导员的马说：“我们早预备好了，快到家里休息！”战士们一进家，就像进到新房似的，热烘烘的炉火上开水壶在喷着热气，整齐的炕、床都铺着毡、毯、席子、铺草，桌椅板凳擦得明亮亮的，窗子都糊得雪白，各家都有一定的人招呼。招待股把准备好的家具分送到各班，样样都有，用啥有啥，感动得指挥员们都说：“这比回到自己家里还方便。”第二日早上刚起来，全村群众锣鼓喧天进到营部，人人带着礼物，活像正月十五闹红火。人们在院中周旋一圈，在营长住屋前停住。郭福生、郭凤廷进到营长住屋时，不等他们开口，郭福生就说一声“老百姓来慰劳一点小意思”。群众马上争先恐后的放下东西，急得教导员连声称谢。招待股又把全村的牲口组织起来拉着给队伍去城里驮煤买菜。
            人民的真诚巩固了部队
    机枪班战士冯锁金到房东关顺妈家去借剪，关顺妈忙跳下炕来去开柜取出一根油条一把剪子来。“俺孩吃了这个油条再走！”锁金不肯吃拿起剪子就跑，老太太追到门外抓住他：“可得吃了这一个！你们为了俺翻身跑东跑西吃不上一顿安生饭，可得吃！可得吃！”说呐硬塞到他手里。
    第二天机枪班正在召开班务会，老太太又提了一筐油条送进来。“同志们不要嫌不好，开着会吃吧！”说完放下就走了。感动得冯锁金向全班同志说：“同志们！老太太对我们这么好我们大家吃了该怎么办？”一个战士提议要给全村老乡来个“满缸”运动，要打胜仗保卫老百姓的翻身果实。孟县战役解放战士靳群生，平常好说个二话，这次他检讨说：“过去我听说为人民服务不知是为了谁，今天才真正认清了人民就像这老太太一样，我要下决心好好干。”许多解放战士受到老乡的真诚招待感动得哭起来。队伍驻了七天，全村的水缸都是满溜溜的，当队伍要出发的那天，各家都准备着好饭请队伍吃，各连也准备好饭请房东，亲亲热热真是一家。每人的挂包里都塞满了老乡的礼物——干粮和柿圪塔。垣曲战斗开始了，战士们都从口袋里取出老乡们送的干粮和柿子来吃。步枪班王冬生说：“一吃老乡的甜柿子，打仗的劲头就提高了。”
            为什不驻咱村
    垣曲战役结束后，上下庄头老百姓听到队伍要返回来，和上次一样的收拾好房子等待着他们，到参战民兵回村来，才知道他们在南茨营驻下了。老汉、小孩、妇女们都想着他们为什么不回来。可巧六连指导员段学英返回来路过上下庄头被群众看见了，马上拉他到村里，问他为什么不把队伍带到上下庄头驻？指导员解释一番走后，他们便派出代表拿上礼物去南茨营探望队伍。
            子弟兵的家
    旧年到了，各排各班都给各人上下庄头的房东做好拜年片，大年初一就送去了。他们在信中说：“我们练兵正紧张，不能回家去过年，全营同志特向诸位父老兄弟拜年，并祝大家过新年快乐。”正月初四，上下庄头老百姓又派出代表携带许多猪肉、鸡蛋去看他们，并慰问伤病员。元宵节那一天，旅部为了感谢上下庄头的老百姓对子弟兵的关怀和爱护，给上下庄头送了一面大旗，上面写着鲜明的五个大字——“子弟兵的家”。（太岳分社）
