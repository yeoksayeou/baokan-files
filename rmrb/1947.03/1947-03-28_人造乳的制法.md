How to Make Artificial Milk

Use several pounds of washed soybean sprouts (the amount depends on your needs). Cut off the thin ends of the soybean sprouts, and chop the heads and bodies with a knife. Put them into a clean iron pot, add water, and cook into a thick soup (the consistency of thin noodle soup is sufficient; the thicker it is, the more nutritious). Add a little white sugar or rock sugar and a little sea salt. Boil the mixture one or two times (this will kill any roundworm eggs and harmful substances in the sugar). Taste the soup to ensure that the sweetness and saltiness are similar to that of human milk. Separately, take a clean bowl and break a fresh raw egg into it. Pour the boiled soybean sprout soup (with sugar and salt) into the egg bowl, stirring constantly while pouring. The amount poured should be enough for one feeding for the baby (increase or decrease the amount according to the baby's size). Feed the baby three to five times a day (the same number of times as breastfeeding). After eating this, if the child's large intestine becomes dry and the stool is too thick, it is advisable to feed them spinach puree (a small amount of washed spinach leaves, chopped) two or three times a month. When using, add the chopped spinach to the soybean sprout soup and boil it once, do not overcook (overcooking will destroy the green vital elements). For newborns, use a small spoon to feed them; there is no need for a "nursing bottle."

When tomatoes are in season, it is best to eat them three times a month. The preparation method is the same as with spinach puree. Children can eat this artificial milk until they are three years old. It can also be used as a nutritional supplement for children aged seven or eight. Weak and milk-deficient mothers can also eat artificial milk or drink soybean sprout soup (thick soup with salt), which can increase milk production. There is no need to eat fish soup or meat soup.

Artificial milk is more reliable than "cow's milk," especially if the cow is sick or the sterilization is not thorough, which can be harmful. Goat's milk is too hot, and it is not suitable for babies to eat too much.

    人造乳的制法
    用洗净的黄豆芽若干斤（多少皆可，以需要而定），将豆芽末稍之细尾巴截去，豆芽头及身用刀切碎，入净铁锅中，加水煮成浓汤（如稀面汤之稠度即可，愈稠，滋养力愈大），加入白糖或冰糖少许、海盐末少许，在浓汤中煮一两滚（这可将糖内之蛔虫卵及有害物煮死），盛出用口尝一尝，使豆芽汤甜咸程度略如人乳之甜咸程度即可。另外用一个净碗，将一个新鲜生鸡蛋在碗中打碎，用煮沸加糖盐的豆芽汤，冲入蛋碗中，边冲边搅，每冲的数量，以够婴儿吃一次即可（婴儿大小可酌情增减），每日吃三五次即行（如同吃人奶的次数）。吃此之后，如小儿大肠干结，大便太稠，宜一月中吃两三次菠菜末（洗净之菠菜叶少许切碎），用时将碎末加入豆芽汤内煮一滚，不要多煮（多煮则绿色生命素损失），初生的婴儿，可用小调羹舀（音咬）喂，不用“哺乳器”也能行。
    有番茄时期，每月吃三次最好，制法与菠菜末同，这种人造乳，小儿可吃到三岁，七八岁的儿童当补养品也好。虚弱乳少的乳母，也可吃人造乳，或喝黄豆芽汤（加盐之浓汤），可使乳汁旺盛。不必吃鱼汤、肉汤也可。
    人造乳比“牛乳”可靠，特别是乳牛有病或消毒不净，吃了有害；羊乳性热，婴儿吃多了不也宜。
