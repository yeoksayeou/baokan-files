    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 18th: Farmers in the Yan'an urban area, amidst roars of "Defend the Border Region," "Defend Chairman Mao," and "Annihilate the Bestial Troops of Hu Zongnan," are persisting in land reform. At a liquidation and grievance meeting held by farmers in the northern suburb of the North District last month on the 28th, poor peasant Han Da and his son tearfully recounted how landlord Hou Xuelin used a broken saddle and a debt of three thousand yuan to take away Han Da's donkey, driving Han Da to the point of attempting suicide. Under the anger of the masses, Hou Xuelin had no choice but to personally lead the donkey back to Han Da. Farmers in Dongguan Township insisted, "Even if the enemy reaches Qilipu, we will still divide the land; even if the enemy enters the city of Yan'an, we will still divide the land!" At the grievance meeting on the 8th, 180 male farmers and 55 female farmers accused landlord Cai Fengzhang and rogue landlord Gao Gen of their crimes. Luo Mingwu, a farmer from Yinjia Gully who suffered the most from Cai Fengzhang's oppression, said, "I borrowed money from him to buy land, dig a well, and plant vegetables. I paid back the money, but he still sued me, and I was beaten with 4,700 strokes of the戒尺 [戒尺 is a kind of ruler used as a disciplinary tool], and imprisoned for three months; with my hand on the bench, he forced me to sign the document." The masses shouted, "When the big tree falls, there's firewood to burn!" "Cai Fengzhang and Gao Gen, quickly return the land you have seized from us!" Finally, Cai Fengzhang and Gao Gen had no choice but to agree to return nine years' worth of rent and the land and cave dwellings they had seized from the poor.

    “消灭胡宗南兽军”怒吼声中
    延安坚持土地改革
    【新华社延安十八日电】延安市区农民在“保卫边区”、“保卫毛主席”、“消灭兽军胡宗南”的怒吼声中，坚持土地改革。北区北郊乡农民清算诉苦大会于上月二十八日举行时，贫农韩大父子哭诉地主侯学林以一个破鞍子和三千元的债款，就拉走了韩大的一条毛驴，当时急得韩大要上吊寻死。在群众的愤怒下，侯学林不得不亲手牵出毛驴还给韩大。东关乡农民坚持“敌人打到七里铺，我们要分地；假定敌人进了延安城，我们还是要分地！”在八日的诉苦大会上，男农民一百八十人，女农民五十五人，控诉地主蔡凤章和流氓地主高根的罪恶。受蔡凤章压迫最惨的尹家沟农民罗明五说：“借他的钱买地，打下井、种下菜，我还了钱，他还要告我，挨了四千七百戒尺，坐了三月牢；手搭在板凳上，逼着我划押。”群众高呼：“打倒大树有柴烧！”“蔡凤章、高根，快退还霸占我们的土地！”终于蔡凤章、高根不得不把九年的租子和霸占穷人的土地、住窑都答应退还。
