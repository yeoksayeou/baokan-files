    Winter Literacy Program in Yehe Promotes Village Work
    [This newspaper's Wu'an dispatch] The winter literacy program in Yehe Village, Third District of Wu'an, has now become a driving force for the village's work. In recent months, it has achieved considerable success: (1) In terms of cultural learning, fifty people can now recognize route slips, and thirteen can write route slips, even Li Yuqing, a 49-year-old farmhand, has learned to write route slips. The winter literacy program has also created thirteen allegros such as "Emancipation" and "Anti-Stubborn Victory" and eight plays such as "Emancipation" and "Breaking Superstition," all written about real events in the village. They were performed at the village's celebration meeting for killing enemy heroes, moving an old woman to tears. (2) It has become a venue for the masses to express their grievances, enhancing their ideological awareness. It has played a promoting role in other work such as giving preferential treatment to military dependents, resisting the enemy, and distributing land.

    野河冬学推动村工作
    【本报武安讯】武安三区野河村冬学，现已成为该村工作的推动机。数月来取得不少成绩：（一）文化学习上，现在有五十个人会认路条，十三个人会写路条，连四十九岁的雇农李鱼庆也学会了写路条。在冬学里还创作了翻身、反顽胜利等十三个快板及翻身，破除迷信等八个剧，写的完全是本村的实事。在家庄庆祝杀敌英雄会上演出，感动的一位老太太掉了眼泪。（二）成了群众诉苦的场合提高了思想觉悟。对其他优抗、分土地等工作起了推动作用。
