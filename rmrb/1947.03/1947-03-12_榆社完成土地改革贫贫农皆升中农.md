　　Yushe Completes Land Reform, Impoverished Peasants All Promoted to Middle Peasants
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 10th] Yushe has completed land reform, and the entire county has universally realized "land to the tiller." The county's "filling the gaps and making things even" movement began in December of last year and turned into an in-depth inspection phase in February of this year. After repeated and continuous emancipation movements, more than 40,000 mu of land, more than 9,900 houses, more than 1,000 head of livestock, more than 9,000 sheep, more than 27,000 shi of grain, and many other clothes, gold, silver, etc., were recovered from the hands of feudal bullies and landlords. After democratic discussion, filling in the potholes first and then making up the difference, and distributing according to need, the peasants were thoroughly emancipated. The 996 extremely poor households and 3,436 poor peasant households, accounting for one-quarter of the county's total households (the county's total number of households is 16,520), have all risen to the level of middle peasants. The peasants were extremely excited after their emancipation. Cao Xiunian, from Xizhou Village, wore landlord Yang Peizhi's clothes, shoes, and socks, and said to everyone he met: "I have been completely emancipated. I didn't go to meetings in the past, but now I don't leave after the meetings are over." Bai Niuyuan from Bai Village happily said: "Only by digging up the roots and demolishing the bricks can we vent our anger completely. Now, it's like the blue sky has returned." Li Fusheng, who used to live as a beggar, posted the following couplet for the New Year: "In the old society, I begged from door to door; in the new society, I have food and clothing." An old peasant who had been emancipated at the age of seventy in Wang Village posted on his door for the New Year: "In the past, I lived alone in a cold kiln at the age of seventy; now I live in a courtyard with buildings and have turned my life around." Qiao Shu, an old bachelor in his sixties from Tan Village, had food and clothing after his emancipation, married a wife, and also had a child, saying that the old man had three joys entering his home.

　　榆社完成土地改革赤贫贫农皆升中农
    【本报太行十日电】榆社完成土地改革，全县已普遍实现了耕者有其田。该县填平补齐运动，始于去年十二月，至今年二月即转向深入检查阶段，经过反复连续的翻身运动，由封建恶霸地主手中收回土地四万余亩，房屋九千九百余间，牲口一千余头，羊九千余只，粮食二万七千余石，其他衣物金银等很多。这些果实经过民主讨论、先填圪洞后补齐、按需分配后，农民得到彻底翻身。占该县户数四分之一（全县总户数为一万六千五百二十户）的九百九十六户赤贫，三千四百三十六户贫农，全部上升为中农。农民翻身后，异常兴奋。西周村曹修年，把地主杨培芝的衣服鞋袜都穿在他身上，见人就说：“我算大翻身啦，过去开会不去，现在是开完会不走。”白村白牛元高兴的说：“挖了根子拆了砖，才算把气出尽，这一下可变成青天啦。”过去以乞丐为生的李福生，过年贴的对联是：“旧社会沿门乞讨，新社会有吃有穿。”王村一个七十岁的翻身老农民，过年门上贴着：“过去孤守寒窑七十岁，现住庭房楼院把身翻。”潭村六十多岁的老光棍乔书翻身后有吃有穿，又娶下老婆，还带有孩子，说老汉是三喜进门。
