After Mass Movement in Shimin, Militia Quality Improves

[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 17th] The people's armed forces of Shimin have been transformed and developed during the land reform movement. According to recent statistics from the county's Armed Forces Committee, there are now 4,000 militiamen, 77 percent of whom are newly developed. Bad elements who had previously infiltrated the militia have also been purged, and the quality has been greatly improved. For example, before land reform in Xiwancun Village, in the Third District, the original militia consisted of 81 people, including 1 landlord, 6 old rich peasants, 14 old well-to-do middle peasants, 34 middle peasants, and 2 poor peasants. After land reform, there are now 12 well-to-do middle peasants, 58 new middle peasants, and 7 poor peasants, totaling 77 people. There has also been a large replenishment of weapons. Most of the weapons previously privately collected by local tyrants and evil gentry have been transferred to the emancipated peasants. There are now ×× rifles and × pistols. All × militia companies in the county regularly march to the front lines. The county is now universally launching a military training movement to improve the three major techniques, with an emphasis on explosives.
