Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. Reports from various sources: Mr. Acheson, the U.S. representative to the Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo, left the United States on the 25th to return to Japan. Before his departure, he gave a radio speech on the 22nd, advocating "speeding up the recovery of the Japanese economy" and "deciding on the Japanese reparations issue as soon as possible." The New York Herald Tribune supported Acheson's proposal in an editorial on the 23rd, stating, "The Americans are willing to rebuild the industry of our former enemy, the Japanese, first, and then build the industry of America's friends and allies in Asia." The newspaper believed that "although this move is unfortunate," "a decision should be made even at the risk of offending by error." The newspaper further revealed the plan of the American reactionaries to support Japanese zaibatsu to colonize China, saying, "Some Americans often have this intention, that is, Japan obtains iron and coal from China, then makes steel, and then sells it to China." This plan of the American reactionaries is gradually underway. MacArthur Headquarters in Tokyo issued an order on the 20th to expand the equipment of Japanese textile factories to 4 million spindles to produce a large amount of cotton yarn.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. TASS News Agency, Moscow, 23rd. A Pravda observer, commenting on the reactionary activities of the American reparations "expert" Pauley, said: Pauley's political career in the United States is notorious. He has connections with oil tycoons. Pauley is equally notorious in international circles. Months ago, he kept spreading complete lies, saying that the Soviet Union "forcibly occupied a large number of Manchurian industries" and kept repeating the number of two billion U.S. dollars like a parrot. He wanted to use this to undermine the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union in resolving the Japanese reparations issue, and at the same time wanted to obtain the ambiguous rights as the protector of China. Pauley's actions have proven to be worthless in the United States and will not be recognized internationally.

　　管制日本委会美代表
    竟主扶植日本财阀
    纽约先驱论坛报透露，美日财阀勾结图殖民地化中国。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】据各方讯：美驻东京盟国管制委员会代表艾其森，于二十五日离美返日。行前于二十二日广播演说，主张“尽速恢复日本经济”，“早日决定日本赔偿问题”。纽约先驱论坛报二十三日社论中支持艾氏主张，并称：“美国人愿意首先重建我们以前的敌人——日本人的工业，然后再建立美国在亚洲的朋友和盟国的工业”该报认为“此举虽属不幸”，“即使冒犯错误的危险，也应采取决定”。该报更进一步的透露美国反动派扶持日财阀而使中国殖民地化的计划说：“某些美国人常有这种意愿，即日本从中国获得铁和煤，然后造成钢，再卖给中国”。美国反动派这一计划正逐步进行中，东京麦克阿瑟总部二十日下令扩充日本纺织厂设备至纺锭四百万枚，以生产大量棉纱。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日电：真理报观察家于评论美国赔偿问题“专家”鲍莱的反动派活动称：鲍莱在美国国内的政治生涯臭名昭彰，他与油业大资本家有关系，鲍莱在国际场合中也同样声名狼藉，数月前他就不断散播彻头彻尾的谎言说：苏联“强占大批满洲工业”并像鹦鹉一样喋喋不休地念着二十亿美元这个数目，他要借此以破坏苏联在解决日本赔款问题中的合法利益，同时想得到作为中国保护人的暖昧权利。鲍莱的作为，业已证明在美国国内一文不值，在国际上也不会得到承认。
