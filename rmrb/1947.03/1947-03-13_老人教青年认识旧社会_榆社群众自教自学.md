Old People Teach Young People to Recognize the Old Society
　　Yushu Masses Educate and Learn by Themselves
　　[Our Newspaper, Taihang, 10th dispatch] In Wenshang's Xishan Village, the masses' awareness has been raised through self-education and self-study methods. From the 10th to the 26th of last month, the emancipated peasants of this village carried out a self-education, self-study, and mutual-teaching-and-learning ideological emancipation movement. In the movement, many old people, because they had more suffering and knew more things, became the best teaching materials. When discussing the question of "Who does the land really belong to?", sixty-year-old Li Erhai said: "Yaze Gen (place name) was originally a river滩. In the 26th year of Guangxu, we repaired more than three qing of land, but after planting it for only two or three years, the landlord Chen Erbao saw it and became jealous. He said that the river滩 was his and privately wrote a fake paper: 'South to Liancun Road, north to the River God Temple (seven li long), west to Xishan Gen, east to Xiyuan Ze Bian (two li wide). The river flows on both sides, the land is in the center, the river is in the center, the land is on both sides.' He seized all the land opened up by the poor. After that, the poor couldn't even dig a handful of soil. If you go to court, the yamen is theirs, so you have to give up. Everyone, tell me, who does the land really belong to?" As a result, many peasants' thoughts of "conscience" and "fate" were broken, and they believed that it was completely reasonable to take back the land now. When eliminating superstitious thoughts, former Feng Shui master Pei Zaiyuan became the best teacher. He said: "When someone died in the Qiao family of Sangshugou, they asked me to 'An Zheng' sixteen dead, I 'An' became twenty-six, and nothing happened. Later, no matter who I gave it to, it was nonsense, and I made money." Under Pei Zaiyuan's confession, the masses realized that Feng Shui masters were like this, and they all said: We have suffered a lot from superstition in the past. In the self-education and self-study of the masses, the district cadres played the role of "lighting the lamp," overcoming the past practice of "cadres speaking and the masses listening."

　　老人教青年认识旧社会
    榆社群众自教自学
    【本报太行十日电】汶上西山村，用自教自学的办法，提高了群众的觉悟。该村翻身农民于上月十日至二十六日，进行了自教自学，互教互学的思想翻身运动。运动中许多老年人因痛苦多，知道的事情多，成了最好的教材。讨论“土地究竟是谁的”问题时，六十岁老汉李二孩说：“崖则根（地名）原是一片河滩，光绪二十六年，俺们修下有三顷多地只种了二、三年，地主陈二保看见眼红，就说这条河滩是他的，私自写了张假纸：“南至廉村道，北至河神庙（七里长）西至西山根，东至西园则边（二里阔）。河流两旁，地在中央，河流中央，地在两旁。”把穷人开出来的地全部侵占去了，以后穷人连一把土都不能去刨。打官司吧，衙门是人家的，只好拉倒。你们大家说地到底是谁的？”由此许多农民“良心”“命运”的思想便打破了，认为现在收回土地是完全合情合理的。清除迷信思想时，前阴阳先生裴在元就当了最好的教师。他说：“桑树沟乔家死了人，叫我“安正”十六死的，我“安”成了二十六，啥问题也没出。后来不管给那家，也是胡说八道，赚了钱就算。”在裴在元自白下，群众认为阴阳仙原来如此，一致说：过去咱们吃迷信的亏真不小呀。在群众自教自学中，区干部起了“拨灯”作用，克服了过去“干部讲群众听”的填鸭作法。
