　　Village Cadre Marries
    Be Vigilant Against Landlord Conspiracies

To the Editors:

    Gao Manjing, the village chief of Zhenzhang Village, Second District of Changzhi, was a penniless resident of a temple in the past. After the liberation, he acquired sixteen mu of land, seven rooms, and a donkey. However, he only cares about himself and wants to marry the eldest daughter (seventeen years old) of a target of struggle. The district cadres couldn't stop him, and he insisted on marrying her. At the wedding, he indulged in extravagance and waste, picking out the best things from the fruits of struggle to make flower shoes for the woman and putting silver jewelry on her. He invited the whole village to eat, spending more than 7,000 yuan just on wine. The village chief also secretly visited his father-in-law's house (the target of struggle). Other cadres dare not say anything, and the masses secretly say: "A few days ago, she was a target of struggle, and now she is the village cadre's wife. He forgets the poor after liberation and has truly forgotten his roots!" The result will be shielding feudal landlords, becoming corrupt and degenerate, and alienating himself from the masses. We think this phenomenon is worth being vigilant about!
    Readers Lin Tang, Ren Bin

    Readers Qiao Wenshun, Hu Rong, and others wrote, saying that there are also similar situations in Wu'xiang, Xiangyuan, and Xingtai. We believe that when marrying the daughter of a landlord, special attention should be paid not to fall for the landlord's honey trap, and not to forget the liberation and dampen the will to struggle, blur the class consciousness, or even degenerate and deteriorate just because you married a landlord's woman. Whether it is cadres or the masses, they should be seriously vigilant. The conspiracies of feudal landlords are very vicious. They will never be willing to give up their sinful rule just like that, but will take advantage of any opportunity to enter. Therefore, all localities should check to see if anyone has fallen into the trap of feudal landlords. If so, they should be well educated so that they can wake up quickly, continue to shatter the landlord's conspiracies, and thoroughly liberate themselves. As for extravagant waste in marrying a wife, it is also not good. At present, various places are launching a production and frugality movement to support our patriotic self-defense war. Wasting the fruits of struggle casually is not only contrary to the principle of frugality, but also harmful to the production and prosperity of "digging out the roots of poverty and planting the roots of wealth" for thorough liberation, because the fruits of struggle are the capital for our production and prosperity. Without this capital, we cannot produce well, and it should attract serious attention from all localities.

### 村干部娶老婆  要警惕地主阴谋

　　村干部娶老婆
    要警惕地主阴谋编辑同志：
    长治二区针漳村村长高满景，过去是个住庙的赤贫，翻身后，得地十六亩，房七间，驴一头。但他只顾自己，要和斗争对象的一个大闺女（十七岁）结婚，区干阻挡不住，非结不行。在结婚时，大举铺张浪费，在斗争果实中，拣上好东西给女人做花鞋，拿上银器给女人戴。请全村人去吃饭，仅喝酒一项花洋七千多元。村长还偷偷的到岳父家（斗争对象）去看望。其它干部不敢吭，群众偷偷的说：前几天是斗争对象，这几天是村干老婆，这样翻身忘穷人，真是忘了本啦！结果会包庇封建地主，腐化堕落，脱离群众的。我们想这种现象，值得提起警惕！
    读者林堂、任斌
    读者乔文顺、胡容等来信，说到武乡、襄垣和邢台等地，也有上述这种情形。我们觉得，和地主女儿结婚，要特别注意不要上了地主的美人计的当，不要娶了地主家的妇女就忘了翻身，消沉了斗争意志，模糊了阶级意识，甚至堕落蜕化。不论干部和群众，都应该严重警惕，封建地主的阴谋是很毒辣的，他们决不甘心就这样放弃他们罪恶的统治，而是一有空子，就会乘虚而入的。所以各地都不防检查一下，看看是否有人上了封建地主的圈套，如果有的话，要好好教育，使他赶快清醒起来，继续粉碎地主阴谋，彻底翻透身。至于娶老婆大肆铺张浪费也是不好的，现在各地正在展开生产节约运动，以支援我们的爱国自卫战争。拿斗争果实随便浪费掉，不但不合节约原则，就是对“挖了穷根栽富根”彻底翻透身的生产发家来说，也是有害的，因为斗争果实就是我们生产发家的本钱，没有了这笔本钱，就不能很好生产了，应引起各地严重注意。
