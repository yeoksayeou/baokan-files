　　From the Perspective of Increasing Wealth in the Border Region
    Border Government Comrades Spin and Farm
    [Report from this newspaper] Individual production within the Border Government agencies is proceeding enthusiastically. On the second day of the second lunar month, at the Yetao fair, Border Government comrades returned from the fair carrying spinning wheels and cotton, discussing their individual production plans with smiles. Comrade Yang Ke has budgeted his annual clothing supply, planning to spin cotton and use labor exchange with the villagers to weave cloth. Many comrades are planning to do the same. The entire Border Government now has eighteen spinning wheels. Female doctor Ren Xiuying and her husband, doctor Liu Xingyang, have set a goal of spinning fifteen jin of cotton in three months. They even compete with each other while spinning. Agricultural "sparrow warfare" is also extremely active, with the court and the General Affairs Office taking the lead, and the Civil Affairs Department not lagging behind. The concept of producing wealth has been recognized by everyone. Any production that cannot increase the wealth of the border region but only benefits individuals is despised. The club has specially prepared red and white lists; those who are actively producing or have good production methods will be placed on the red list.

　　从增加边区财富着眼
    边府同志纺花种地
    【本报讯】边府机关个人生产，已在热烈进行中。阴历二月初二，冶陶大会，边府同志赶会归来，均背着纺车与棉花，笑谈着各人的生产计划。杨克同志已节约全年被服供给，计划纺花与老乡变工织布，很多同志都计划这样做。全边府现已有纺车十八架，女医生任秀英同志与她的丈夫刘兴洋医生，订出三个月纺花十五斤的计划。他二人纺花时，并互相竞赛。农业上的“麻雀战”也极活跃，法院与总务处首先动手，民政厅也不落后。生产财富的观念，已为每人所认识，凡是不能增益边区财富而只能使个人得利的生产，已为人所不齿。俱乐部特装红白两榜，积极生产或生产方式好的，将上红榜。
