Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th. The private textile industry in Hai (men) Qi (dong) County, Suzhong, which is far behind the enemy lines of Chiang Kai-shek's army, is thriving under the support of the democratic government. The county produces more than 300,000 bolts of cloth annually, not only achieving self-sufficiency in clothing but also being able to sell to other areas. Haiqi was originally one of the famous cotton-producing areas. After the land reform, the democratic government and the Women's Federation focused on leading self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-dyeing, and the textile industry has greatly developed. According to statistics from one district alone, there are more than 15,000 female spinners, with an average of two looms per three households, and more than ten sock knitting machines per township. Due to the improvement of technology, the patterns and colors of the cloth are also diverse.

　　自弹自纺自织自染
    苏中年产布三十万匹
    【新华社华中十二日电】远处蒋军后方的苏中海（门）启（东）县民间纺织业，在民主政府扶植下蒸蒸日上，全县年产布三十万匹以上，不但做到穿衣自给，且可推销外地。海启原为著名产棉区之一，土地改革后民主政府与妇联会均着重领导自弹自纺自织自染，纺织事业乃大大发展。仅据一个区统计，即有纺妇一万五千余名，平均每三户有两架织布机，每乡有十余部织袜机，由于技术的提高，布面花色亦多种多样。
