[This newspaper's correspondent in] Ji-Lu-Yu [Region] on the 16th reports: In Guancheng, due to rent reduction and debt clearing targeting feudal landlords in recent years, many landlords superficially pretend to be middle or poor peasants, while secretly concealing a great deal of property. After inspection by the county committee, a joint action was organized across the entire district or in smaller areas to launch a thorough investigation and struggle against the landlords. It has now been discovered in the first district that five landlords were hiding two urns of antique porcelain and twelve silver ingots. In the second district, Yao Da and ten other families in Jiang Village were found to have four silver ingots. In the fourth district, more than eighty bags of grain, fifty-one silver dollars, five liang of silver, and four gold rings were discovered in Xililou. A Mauser pistol was found in Wenzhai Village; four cartloads of copper were found in Yanzhuang. After this inspection, the masses' enthusiasm for struggle has been greatly enhanced, and the cadres have realized that their mass viewpoint was poor in the past, and they have overcome the ideas of "there is no point" and "good enough."

　　观城地主隐蔽财物
    伪装中农逃避清算
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】观城由于几年来对封建地主的减租清债，地主表面多伪装中农或贫农，暗中隐蔽很多资材。经县委会检查，组织了全区或小区的联合行动，展开对地主的清查与斗争。现已在一区查出有五家地主隐藏两瓮古瓷器、十二个元宝。二区姜庄姚大十家查出四个元宝。四区西李楼查出八十多袋粮食、五十一块现洋、五斤白银、四个金戒指等。文明寨查出一支盒子枪；阎庄查出四大车铜。经过这次检查，群众斗争的积极性大大提高，干部才认识到过去自己群众观念差，克服了“没搞头”“差不多”的思想。
