    【This Newspaper, Jinan 21st】In the newly recovered areas of Gaotang, land reform is being promoted, and the broad masses are universally brewing an upsurge of emancipation. Since persuading nearly a thousand puppet miscellaneous personnel to repent and uncovering more than one hundred guns, clarifying the situation, the leadership in Gaotang has proposed selecting key areas to mobilize the masses. The county party secretary went deep into × village in the eighth district to promote land reform. The peasants listened with rapt attention; even three farm women stopped spinning to listen quietly. Due to the publicity and enlightenment in this village, activists emerged, breaking the ice. When cadres in the seventh district carried out publicity, they paid attention to integrating with the actual situation. After publicizing the ten major crimes of the miscellaneous troop commander Deng Xiechen, a member of the masses complained to the cadres, saying that his three sons had been killed by Deng. The unit immediately grasped the education, enlightened class consciousness, and cultivated him into an activist. County and district cadres, undeterred by hardship, actively helped the peasants to emancipate themselves, and many villages have begun to brew an upsurge of emancipation.
    【This Newspaper, Jinan 23rd】In the process of investigation in Makang Village, Pingyuan, the masses launched a struggle against the landlord Li Luowen's family. A total of 130 people spoke of their sufferings, put forward 255 opinions, and unanimously proposed the slogans "Return the land and houses to the old home" and "Return the property to its original owner." The village is now in the process of settling accounts.
