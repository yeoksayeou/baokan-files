　　Liberated Peasants Rush to Buy Farm Tools for Production
    Prosperous Scene at Yehtao Livestock Fair
    [Special Dispatch] On February 22nd (second day of the second lunar month), the famous Yehtao Livestock Fair in Wu'an was held. On that day, liberated peasants from Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi and other places came from afar to buy livestock and make farm tools, preparing to produce to their hearts' content on their newly acquired land. I squeezed from inside the village to the fairground outside the village. The open space of hundreds of acres was already filled with scattered stalls, tents, livestock, farm tools... It was full of infinitely joyful peasants who were conducting various transactions. In front of dozens of hardware stalls, peasants buying iron shovels and hoes were crowded like sardines. You see: "I want a hoe," "I'll buy two shovels," "..." In just a little while, more than forty shovels and more than twenty hoes on a hardware stall were bought as if they were flying away. Mr. Zhang, who was happy about his booming business, said: "The reason why business is so good this year is because in the past only a few rich people were customers, but now everyone has been liberated and everyone has become a customer." The most lively place was the livestock market. Five or six hundred animals were running around on the river beach. People who didn't have livestock in the past, today jumped on the back of their favorite animals and wandered around the field, then paid the money with satisfaction and rode back smiling. According to incomplete statistics: During the three-day conference, farmers purchased more than two hundred and fifty livestock. In the pocket market, I saw more pockets than I had ever seen before, and the peasants were buying them so enthusiastically. According to them: "This is to prepare for this year's great production!" At the west end of the venue, there were several large piles of baskets, manure baskets, plows, harrows and other farm tools every day, but every day they were sold out in less than half a day. During the few days of transactions, I also discovered a new and important thing, that is, the peasants were very willing, and universally bought books and stationery for their children. At a small stationery stall, after an old man bought a writing brush for his grandson, the grandson was not satisfied and wanted to buy an ink stick. The old man did not hesitate at all, and smiled so wide that his mouth cracked open and said: "Okay! Buy another one if you want!" Is this a normal phenomenon? I asked the owner of the stationery stall, and he said: "The business was never so good that year!" In the short moment when I asked him, I saw that he had earned more than a thousand yuan. On this day, the Yehtao Xinhua Bookstore also specially set up two sales departments, but they were still crowded. They can sell 110,000 to 120,000 yuan worth of books and stationery every day. In the center of the venue, the Martyrs' Hall made of white cloth stood there, and every peasant who walked in was in awe. They clearly remembered that they could have today because of the blood of these martyrs. Next to the Martyrs' Hall was the cultural shed set up with the help of the Wu'an People's Education Center. Through dozens of colorful pictures, the visiting peasants more clearly understood the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous civil war, and the true face of Chiang Kai-shek's "Chiang-American Commercial Treaty" of betraying his ancestors; At the same time, they also recognized that the People's Liberation Army was winning battles every day, and that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, they would surely move towards victory. During the three-day conference, rural drama troupes from Yangyi and other places specially organized conference entertainment, among which the dramas such as "Turning Over" and "Changing Work Style" were the most popular among the audience. The conference began to disperse on the 24th.

　　翻身农民争购农具闹生产
    冶陶骡马会景象繁荣
    【本报特讯】二月二十二日（旧历二月初二），为武安冶陶著名骡马大会会期。是日河南、河北、山东、山西等地的翻身农民，均远道赶来，购买牲口，添制农具，准备在自己新获的土地上痛痛快快的生产。我从村内挤到村外的会场，数百亩地的旷场上，已被星罗棋布的货摊、帐棚、牲口、农具………塞满了。充溢着无限喜悦的农民，正进行各种各样的交易，在几十家铁货摊前，购买铁锹锄头的农民，已挤得水泄不通，你看：“我要一把锄”“我买两张锹”“…………”只一会儿，一家铁货摊上的四十多张锹，二十多把锄就像飞一样的被买走了。高兴自己生意兴隆的张老板说：“今年生意所以好，是因为过去只有几家有钱人是顾主，现在大家都翻了身，大家都成了顾主了。”最热闹的是牲口市，五六百匹牲口在河滩上跑来跑去，过去没有牲口的人，今天也跳到自己喜爱的牲口背上，在场上溜来溜去，然后满意的交完了钱，笑嘻嘻的骑着回去了。据不完全统计：在三天大会中，农民购买的牲口，就在二百五十余头以上。在口袋市上，我看到了过去从来没有看见过那样多的口袋，而农民们的购买也是那样热烈。据他们说：“这是替今年大生产作准备的！”在会场的西头，每天都有好几大堆箩筐、粪筐、犁、耙等农具，但是每天都是不到半天，就卖得空空了。几天交易过程中，我还发现了一个新的重要的事情，就是农民们都很乐意，而且普遍的给娃娃们买书籍和文具了，在一家小文具摊上，一个老汉给孙孙买了一枝毛笔后，孙孙还不满足还要再买一锭墨，老汉没有半点犹豫，笑得裂开了嘴说：“好！要买就再买一锭吧！”这是平常的现象吗？我问了文具摊的老板，他说：“那年也没有今天的生意好呵！”就在我问他那短短刹那间，我看到他收入了一千多块钱。冶陶新华书店这天也专门设了两个门市部，但是仍然拥挤不通，他们每天可以卖出书籍文具十一、二万元。在会场的中心，白布扎成的烈士堂耸立在那里，每个走进去的农民，都肃然起敬，他们清楚的记得，自己能有今天，都是这些烈士的鲜血换来的。烈士堂的旁边是武安民教馆帮助设立的文化棚，通过几十幅彩色的图画，参观的农民们，更明白的认识了蒋介石的卖国内战的罪恶，蒋介石出卖祖宗的“蒋美商约”的真面目；同时也认识了人民解放军在天天打胜仗，认识了在毛主席朱总司令领导下。一定能够走向着胜利。三天大会期间，阳邑等地的农村剧团，专门组织了大会娱乐，其中演出的翻身与转变作风等话剧，最受观众欢迎。大会至二十四日始散。
