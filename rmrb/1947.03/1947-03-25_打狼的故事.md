In Libi, Qingshui, there is a village of forty-three households. Among these forty-three households, twenty-two are named Chen. Several Chen families are feudal forces who rule the entire village. However, in past struggles, due to the mischief of special agents and a few bad elements, some were only lightly scratched, while others were not touched at all. On the contrary, they mixed into the struggle, gained benefits, and concealed themselves.

I. The "Wolf's" Beating Experience

In this village, there is a man named Zhai Shikuang, with a family of seven. In the past, he had 58.5 mu of land, making him a middle peasant. Due to famine years and lack of food and drink, debts accumulated, and 36.5 mu of his land were seized by landlords Zhao Taihua and Ren Jiazhen. He still had 22 mu of land. He is a robust man with triangular eyes, high cheekbones, protruding ears, and a pointed chin. As a child, he was mischievous and naughty, and the old folks called him "Yellow-haired Wolf," a name he still bears today. At the age of eleven, he herded cattle for others, and at fourteen, he worked as a farmer, being strong and willing to work. Because his wife had a pockmarked face and was slovenly, they had marital discord, and she ran away from home. Not causing trouble for others and finding no way out, she returned home. From then on, he did not engage in proper work and indulged in eating, drinking, gambling, and prostitution. The feudal forces Chen Zhibiao and Cui Yaoxi originally disliked him for being righteous and often used this as an excuse to extort and beat him. People in the village also looked down on him. However, he remained strong and often opposed the landlords and feudal forces. When the Central Army was present, the landlords secretly reported him as a traitor, and he had to pay a ransom to avoid being executed, selling his cattle and mortgaging his land to pay the fine. When the Japanese occupied Qingshui, they selected him as the puppet village head. The landlords again secretly reported him as a disguised Eighth Route Army soldier and fined him once more. During the struggle last year, the leadership did not know his situation, and the landlord rulers played tricks, using the "Wolf" as a shield, and he was struggled against, losing his house, land, cattle, and the fruits of his past reclaiming (land seized by the landlords in the past).

II. After Beating the "Wolf"

After beating the "Wolf," they also attacked Wagangzhai (a group in the front street village), struggling against a total of eight households: three feudal rich peasants, two wealthy middle peasants, two middle peasants, and one poor peasant. From then on, the masses felt uneasy: "Who knows when it will be our turn?"

This time, after the county cadre meeting, Political Commissar Yang conveyed the implementation of "land to the tiller," everyone examined the situation, and the feudal forces had not yet been crushed, and many middle peasants were harmed.

During the discussion of the middle peasant issue, everyone specifically discussed the "Wolf's" situation. Everyone said he was a middle peasant, but some said he was a local tyrant. Those who said he was a local tyrant argued that if he were, why was he fined and nearly executed when the Central Army was present? Why did the village landlord Chen Zhibiao seize his garden land, Cui Yaoxi take 120 jin of his white flour, Cui Zhenxi take away his cattle, and Zhao Taihua and Ren Jiazhen take his land through debt? The other side said that he would demand a share of the loot when others stole things. After this discussion, it was discovered that those who said he was a local tyrant mainly did so because they had gained his property in the struggle. Who really wanted to beat the "Wolf"? Chen Zhibiao and Zhang Mingju were the masterminds because they were afraid that their bad deeds would be exposed and adopted a preemptive strike. Only then did everyone understand that the "Wolf" was a basic element of the masses, not only suffering hardship but also being the key to uniting the middle and poor peasants. If the "Wolf" could be united, there would be no problem with the middle peasants, and they would be united as one.

However, the masses in the village knew this but still had to mobilize the masses, the middle peasants panicked, and the "Wolf" was so scared that he soiled his pants.

III. Beating the Real Wolf

After education in the winter school, everyone realized that this time was to thoroughly eliminate the feudal forces (landlords and local tyrants) and realize "land to the tiller." Everyone understood, "We are all the oppressed." Activists brewed among the masses that poor and middle peasants were one family and should unite to struggle against the feudal forces, thus reassuring the middle peasants and encouraging them to participate in the struggle.

In this struggle against feudal rich peasant Chen Yonglin, among the 95 participants, there were 38 middle peasants, 30 poor peasants, 11 new middle peasants, 2 wealthy middle peasants, and 4 rich peasants. In this struggle meeting, the "Wolf" was no longer the target of beatings. The "Wolf" was with the masses, holding solid evidence, and powerfully questioning, "Chen Yonglin, who did you rely on to be so powerful?" Chen Yonglin replied, "Zhai Zhende." Du Wenjin said, "Chen Yonglin, are you trying to deceive us? You won't get away with it if you don't tell the truth!" At this point, he revealed his gang of accomplices.

In short, from this struggle, the poor and middle peasants became even more united, and the middle peasants were very active in the struggle. They are now actively preparing for a hot and fiery anti-feudal struggle.

(This story is selected from the Taiyue Xinhua Daily. Although the narration is brief, it describes how feudal forces forced a person to become a "wolf" and how they used other people's lives and flesh to cover up their exploitation and avoid being struggled against. It also points out the importance of mobilizing the backward and uniting the middle peasants. These are all important issues in today's mass movement. We hope that those who go deep into the countryside can truthfully reflect this complex struggle. It would be even better if they could adopt a literary form!)

    打狼的故事
    李铁侬  王兆基
    沁水里壁，有一个四十三户人家的村子，这四十三户中，就有二十二户是姓陈，姓陈的有几家是封建势力，统治全村，可是这些人，在过去的斗争中，因为特务与少数坏分子的作怪，有的只是轻轻的从皮上过了一下，有的还根本没有动，相反的他们混在斗争中得了果实，掩盖了自己。
    一、“狼”的挨打经历
    这村里有个翟世宽，家有七口人，在从前有土地五十八亩半，是个中农。因灾荒年没吃喝，累债把三十六亩半地被马道地主赵太华、任加贞夺走了，自己还有二十二亩地。他身体魁梧，三角眼、高额骨、招风耳、尖下巴，小时顽皮淘气，当时的老汉们便叫他黄毛狼，一直到现在人家还叫他狼。他十一岁上给人家放牛，十四岁务农，有力肯动。因为媳妇长的满脸麻子，又龌龊，夫妻不和生气逃跑在外，不闹人家，无出路，才又返回家来；从此不务正业，吃喝嫖赌样样全。他曾坐牛皮包过黄河，到陕西贩大烟土，封建势力陈之标、崔姚喜本来讨厌他好打不平，便借此经常讹诈捆打他，村里人也看他不起。但他还很坚强，常和地主封建势力作对，中央军在时地主密告他是汉奸，赔过斩，卖牛典地给了罚款；日本人占了沁水，又选他为伪闾长，地主又密告他是八路军便衣，罚了一次款。在去年斗争时，领导上不知道他的情形，地主统治者从中捣鬼，把“狼”挡了炮眼，斗出了他的房子、地和牛和他在过去清算回来的果实（过去地主夺走的地）。
    二、打了“狼”以后
    打了“狼”又打瓦岗寨（前街村的集团），共斗争了八户，封建富农三户，富裕中农二户、中农二户、贫农一户。从此以后，群众心里有了鬼：“不知什时，就会轮到自己头上。”
    在这次群众开始经过县干会议杨政委传达了实现耕者有其田以后，大家检查了一下，封建势力还没被打垮了，部分损害不少中农。
    在讨论中农问题时，大家曾专门讨论“狼”的情形。大家都说他是中农，但有的却说他是恶霸。这方面人说，他既然是恶霸，为什么中央军在时，受罚赔斩，咱村地主陈之标霸了他的园子地，崔姚喜拿了他一百二十斤白面，崔真秀拉走他的牛，赵太华、任加贞累走他的地，日本人说他是八路军便衣，罚了他二百元鬼票？那方面人说他，别人偷上东西他就要分赃。讨论至此，发现说他是恶霸的人，主要是因为在斗争中得了他的果实。究竟是谁要打“狼”的呢？陈之标与张明聚是主谋，因为他们害怕说出他们的坏事，采取了先发制人的手段。这才大家明白了，狼是基本群众，不但是苦，而且是咱中贫农间的钥匙，如果能团结了“狼”，中农决没有问题，会团结成一圪瘩。
    可是村里群众知道了还要发动群众，中农慌张了，“狼”吓的屙在裤子里。
    三、打了真正的狼
    经过冬学上教育，大家认识这次是彻底消灭封建势力（地主恶霸），实现耕者有其田，大家才明白的说：“我们都是受压迫者。”积极分子在群众中酝酿了贫雇中农是一家人，应团结起来向封建势力作斗争，因之中农也就放心，而且参加了斗争。
    在这次斗争封建富农陈永林时，共参加的九十五人中，中农三十八人，贫农三十人，新中农十一人，富裕中农二人，富农四人。在这次斗争会上，“狼”不再是挨打的对象了，“狼”和群众在一起，握着真凭实据，有力的在质问着：“陈永林，你那样利害仗谁势？”陈永林答：“翟真德的。”杜文锦说：“陈永林，你这是赶马送草啦，你不实说不算？”这时他才说出他那群狐群狗党来。
    总之从这次斗争中，贫中农更加显示团结紧了，中农而且在斗争中很积极，他们刻下正在积极准备热火朝天的反封建斗争。
    （这篇故事选自太岳新华日报，叙述虽然简略，但写出了封建势力如何把一个人逼成“狼”，又如何用别人的生命和血肉来掩盖自己的剥削，避免被斗争；并指明了发动落后，团结中农的重要，这些都是今日群运的重要问题，我们希望深入农村的人，能把这种复杂的斗争，如实的反映出来，如果能采用文艺的形式，那就更好！）
