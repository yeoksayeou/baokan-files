(Our newspaper, Jinan, 15th dispatch) Jize, an advanced county in land reform in Southern Hebei, after training more than 1,200 village cadres, convened a county-wide district cadre meeting in early February, resolving to strive to achieve "Cultivating Three, Surplus One." According to investigations, achieving "Cultivating Three, Surplus One" in this county is not easy relying solely on agricultural income. For example, the agricultural harvest in well-irrigated areas is the largest. Its income is enough to maintain 88.9% of the annual consumption and public land grain. The agricultural income from cotton fields can maintain 96% of the annual consumption and public grain, while the agricultural income in alkaline areas can only maintain 64% of the annual consumption and public land grain.

From the perspective of labor and livestock in each village, in well-irrigated areas, each laborer averages 15 mu, cotton areas average 33 mu, wheat areas average 22 mu, dry land areas average 18 mu, and alkaline areas average 20 mu. In well-irrigated areas, each livestock averages 90 mu, cotton areas average 109 mu, wheat areas average 170 mu, general areas average 130 mu, and alkaline areas average 209 mu. To cultivate the land well, each hectare of general dry land requires two strong livestock, while well-irrigated land requires three to four. If mutual aid is vigorously developed, it can not only solve the shortage of labor but also free up certain manpower for sideline occupations. According to calculations, Nan Zhendi (well-irrigated area) can free up 40 people, Chai Zhuang (cotton area) can free up 50 people, and Ting Zibancun (dry land area) can free up 66 people. If more oxen are bought for deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, the yield can definitely be increased. Sideline occupations such as leaching salt, leaching saltpeter, flower workshops, oil presses, and textiles generate significant income. According to the production plan statistics of Zhou Guanzhuang, the income from leaching salt exceeds agricultural income by 1,575 shi. Other sideline occupations can also generate an average income of 8 shi per person per year. Furthermore, based on the investigation of well-irrigated areas, cotton-growing areas, wheat-producing areas, general areas, and alkaline areas, all have the conditions to achieve "Cultivating Three, Surplus One."

For example, the combined total of Huang Gou and Nan Zhen in the well-irrigated area currently cultivates 9,900 mu of land, including 2,940 mu of well-irrigated land. The yield of well-irrigated land is 1.6 dou per mu (1 dou of wheat equals 2 dou of coarse grain), and the yield of dry land averages 5 dou per mu (each dou of coarse grain is 25 jin), totaling 8,172 shi of grain. Textile production: assuming each strong woman, after deducting newly worn cloth, can weave and sell 5 bolts of cloth per year, a total of 3,600 bolts are woven, and each bolt of cloth is exchanged for 4 dou of coarse grain, totaling 1,440 shi. Other sideline income exceeds 1,637 shi, totaling 11,242 shi for the three items. The two villages have a total of 2,697 people, and the annual consumption and public land grain (approximately 3 shi per person) total 8,014 shi, leaving a surplus of 3,235 shi, an average of 1.2 dou per person.

For example, the four villages of Chen Zhuang, Fu Ma Zhai, Meng Guanzhuang, and Ba Jiazhai in the alkaline area currently cultivate 12,755 mu of land, which can produce 3,816.5 shi of grain (3 dou per mu). Leaching salt: assuming each strong person leaches 800 jin per year, 588,000 jin of salt can be leached, which can be exchanged for 3,200 shi of coarse grain. The productive force of textile women is 504 people, weaving 2,858 chi of cloth, exchanging for more than 1,143 shi of coarse grain, totaling 8,169.5 shi of coarse grain. The four villages have a total of 1,982 people, deducting the annual consumption and public land grain of 5,975 shi (an average of 3 shi per person), leaving a surplus of 2,194.5 dou, an average of 1.07 dou per person.

Based on the study of the above materials, all cadres have extremely high confidence in achieving "Cultivating Three, Surplus One." The meeting put forward the following opinions on the leadership of the production movement:

1.  Based on the principle of voluntary combination, organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, and conduct in-depth organizational work in four seasons of the year: first, spring plowing; second, summer weeding; third, autumn harvest and wheat planting; fourth, winter sideline production. Strive to organize more than 70% of the labor force in two years.

2.  Resolve the contradictions in mutual aid and organically use the surplus labor. Each mutual aid group must combine with sideline occupations and strive for the mutual aid group to engage in sideline occupations to absorb more labor. At the same time, the requirement of poor families to calculate labor and return grain immediately should also be resolved. The method of using sideline occupation to earn money and return grain can be used, because wealthy households are also unwilling to provide grain in the spring, but they have no objection to repaying labor with earned money.

3.  In terms of crops, plan to plant some cotton, peanuts, rice, indigo, tobacco, etc., to prevent grain disasters and strive to sell less grain.

4.  If a mass production movement is created, it should be emphasized to convene family meetings, formulate family production plans, and create a climax of husband and wife competition, brother competition, and everyone participating in the movement.

5.  Relevant production leadership departments should participate in and combine with the production movement. Bank loans should be used centrally to support indigo planting, etc. River construction work should be carried out in the gaps of agricultural production.

Currently, all villages in the county are generally brewing to launch a large-scale production movement.

　　鸡泽干部深入研究全县情况
    决争取实现耕三余一
    【本报冀南十五日电】冀南土地改革先进县份——鸡泽，为开展大生产运动，集训一千二百余村干后，于二月上旬又召开全县区干部会议，决议为实现“耕三余一”而奋斗。据调查该县要实现耕三余一，单靠农业收入是不易的，如井浇地区的农业收获量最大。其收入够维持全年消耗及公地粮的百分之八八·九。棉花地农业收入能维持全年消费及公粮百分之九六，碱地区农业收入仅能维持全年消费及公地粮的百分之六四。从各村劳动力和畜力上看，在井浇地区每个劳动力平均一五亩，棉花地区平均三三亩，麦地区平均二二亩，旱地区平均一八亩，碱地区平均二○亩。井浇地区每个牲口平均九○亩，种花地区平均一○九亩，种麦地区平均一七○亩，一般地区平均一三○亩，碱地区平均二○九亩，要把地种好，一般旱地每顷须两个强壮牲口，井地须三个至四个。如能大力开展互助，不仅能解决劳力不足，还能抽出一定人力进行副业。根据计算南臻底（井地）能抽出四○人，柴庄（花地）能抽出五○人，亭自颁村（旱地）能抽出六六人。如果添买耕牛深耕细作，产量定可增加。副业如淋盐、淋硝、花坊、油坊、纺织等收入很大，据宙贯庄生产计划统计，淋盐收入超过农业收入一五七五石，其他副业每人每年也能平均收入八石。再根据井浇地区、种棉地区、产麦地区、一般地区、碱地区的调查，均有实现耕三余一的条件。如井浇地区以黄沟南臻的合计，现种地九千九百亩，内井浇地二千九百四十亩，井地产量每亩大斗一石六斗（麦子一斗折粗粮二斗），旱地产量每亩平均五大斗（每斗粗粮二十五斤），总计能产粮八千一百七十二石。纺织按每个壮年妇女除去新穿布，全年可织五匹卖布，共织三千六百匹，每匹布换四斗粗粮，共换一千四百四十石，其他副业收入一千六百三十七石以上，三项共计一万一千二百四十二石。两村共二千六百九十七人，全年消耗及公地粮（每人约三石）共该八千零十四石，余三千二百三十五石，每人平均一石二斗。如碱地区陈庄、驸马寨、孟贯庄、八家砦四村合计，现种地一万二千七百五十五亩，能产粮三千八百一十六石五斗，（每亩三斗）。淋盐按每个壮年全年淋八百斤计，能淋盐五十八万八千斤，能换粗粮三千二百石。纺织妇女生产力五百零四人，织布二千八百五十八尺，换粗粮一千一百四十三石以上，共收粗粮八千一百六十九石五斗，四村共一千九百八十二人，除全年消费及公地粮五千九百七十五石（每人平均三石），余粮二千一百九十四石五斗，每人平均一石零七升。根据对以上材料的研究，全体干部对实现耕三余一信心极高。会上对生产运动的领导提出如下意见：一、根据自愿结合原则，将全劳力半劳力组织起来，一年分四季进行深入组织工作：一是春耕，二是夏锄，三是秋收种麦，四是冬季副业生产，两年争取组织百分之七十以上的劳动力。二、解决互助中的矛盾，将剩余劳力有机使用。每个互助组必须结合副业，并争取互助组经营副业，以吸收更多劳动力，同时亦应解决贫家马上计工还粮的要求，可用副业经营赚钱还粮的办法，因富裕户春天亦不愿出粮，如以赚的钱还工倒都没有意见。三、在农作物上有计划的种些棉花、花生、稻子、蓝、烟叶等防备谷害，争取少卖粮食。四、如造成群众性的生产运动，应强调召开家庭会议，订家庭生产计划，造成夫妻竞赛，兄弟竞赛，人人参加运动的热潮。五、有关生产领导部门要参与和结合生产运动，银行贷款要集中使用，扶植种靛等。河务建设工作，要在农业生产空隙中进行。现全县各村正普遍酝酿开展大生产运动。
