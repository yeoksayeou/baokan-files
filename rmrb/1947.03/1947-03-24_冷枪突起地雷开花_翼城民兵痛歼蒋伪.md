    【This Dispatch from Taiyue on the 22nd】The Yicheng militia has promoted a tactic combining ambushes and landmines, dealing heavy blows to Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn troops everywhere. On the 2nd, more than 40 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers entrenched in Beiguan attempted to loot grain in the Second District. When they entered the pre-set minefield of Dahekou, our militia ambushed them with sniper fire. The enemy panicked and scurried about, triggering several landmines, resulting in 3 deaths and 4 injuries. On the same day, another mobile demolition team went deep near the enemy stronghold of Dajiao in Jiang County to lay mines. About 50 enemy soldiers advanced towards Zhongheshui area. Our demolition team bravely fought back, and the enemy triggered landmines in the chaos, killing one and wounding three. In the militia's pursuit with sniper fire, another three enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. On the 6th, more than 20 enemy soldiers invaded Dahekou again and were ambushed by the militia, capturing six enemy soldiers including a platoon leader, and seizing four rifles and one machine gun.
