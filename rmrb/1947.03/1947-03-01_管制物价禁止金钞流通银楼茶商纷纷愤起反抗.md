Following Chiang Kai-shek's announcement banning the circulation of gold currency, black market trading emerged in Shanghai within twenty-four hours. Black markets in Chengdu, Shenyang, and other places also began to surface. Speculators, especially those with power and influence, went underground. Opinion leaders in Nanjing and Shanghai pointed out that the ban on gold currency trading was solely due to the Central Bank having already unloaded over two million taels of gold when gold prices soared and its US dollar and foreign exchange reserves being depleted. Thus, it attempted to forcibly reclaim gold currency at extremely low prices. However, the Central Bank's gold currency recovery over the past ten days has been negligible. The victims of this measure are only ordinary people who purchased gold currency due to the sharp fall in Chiang currency. They bought gold currency at high prices of 900,000 yuan (per tael) and 18,000 to 20,000 yuan (per US dollar). In an instant, with a "ban on trading" gold currency, 30-40% of the value was plundered by the Four Big Families. They were forced to sell their gold currency, but only received 480,000 Chiang yuan (per gold) and 11,000 yuan (per dollar). At the same time, dozens of gold jewelry stores and silver shops in the Chiang-controlled areas were forced to close. The "Measures for Handling Gold Ornaments" announced by the Chiang government on the 20th stipulated that the gold ornaments in each store must be sold at official prices within three months, further pushing the industry to the brink of bankruptcy.

However, workers and small and medium-sized business owners who were brutally exploited by the Four Big Families in the economic emergency measures are launching strikes to demand wage increases. It is expected that the end of the month will be a critical juncture, as hundreds of wage increase demands must be addressed at that time (United Press, Shanghai, 24th). Representatives of silver shops from various regions in the Chiang-controlled areas have gathered in Shanghai. The industry held a representative conference on the 22nd and will establish a "Silver Shop Self-Preservation Committee" to call for the abolition of the Chiang government's laws that strangle the silver shop industry. On the 23rd, tea merchants in Shanghai rose up to demand "price adjustments." The Tea Trade Association expressed opposition to the Chiang government's "new economic measures" and warned that tea prices must be increased, otherwise the tea industry will find other ways to export tea.

　　管制物价禁止金钞流通银楼茶商纷纷愤起反抗
    蒋介石宣布禁止金钞流通后不出二十四小时，上海即已出现低声耳语的黑市买卖，成都沈阳等地的黑市亦均日露头角，投机家特别是有势力的大投机家已遁入地下。京沪舆论界指出：金钞买卖的禁止，仅因中央银行二百余万两黄金已在金价暴涨时抛出，美钞及外汇亦已涸竭，从而企图强迫以极低价格扒回，但旬日来中央银行所扒金钞却微不足道。此一措施的牺牲者仅为一般由于蒋币猛跌而购入金钞之小户，他们以九十万元（一两）及一万八千到二万元；（一美金）的高价购入金钞，转瞬间一声“禁止买卖”金钞，价钱之百分之三四十均被四大家掠劫而去。他们被迫出卖金钞，但所得仅为蒋币四十八万（金）及一万一千余元（钞）。同时蒋管区数十家金饰店及银楼均被迫停业，廿日蒋政府公布的金饰处理办法，并规定各店楼之金饰均须于三个月内按官价售出，该业益面临破产悲运。
    但在经济紧急措施中被四大家残酷剥夺的工人与中小资产者工厂工人正在发动罢工，要增求资，预料月底将为紧急关头，因是时数百起增资要求必须加以答复（合众社上海二十四日电）。蒋管区各地银楼业代表已纷集上海，该业已于二十二日召开代表大会，将成立“银楼业图存委员会”，呼吁废除蒋政府扼杀银楼业之法令。二十三日沪市茶商群起要求“调整物价”，茶业同业公会表示反对蒋政府的“新经济措施”，警告称：必须提高茶价，否则茶界将以其他办法输出茶叶。
