The pseudo-constitution, "three-read" passed by the Chiang clique's so-called National Assembly on November 25th last year, is divided into fourteen chapters, totaling one hundred and seventy-four articles. But it can be summarized in eight characters: The people have no power, the autocrat holds sway.

The pseudo-constitution begins by saying "The National Assembly of the Republic of China, entrusted by all the people, based on the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen who founded the Republic of China…formulates this constitution, promulgates it throughout the country, and will forever abide by it." But in reality, "this constitution" is only "entrusted" by Chiang Kai-shek alone and "formulated" according to the will of Chiang Kai-shek the autocrat. Chapter I (Articles 1 to 6) is the "General Principles," which are also a few empty words, saying that "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People, owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people," "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people," "The territory of the Republic of China is based on its inherent boundaries, and shall not be altered without the resolution of the National Assembly," "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal,"………But in reality, it should be read as "China is a fascist state based on Chiang's principles, ruled by Chiang, and enjoyed by Chiang's dictatorial system," "Chiang Kai-shek can arbitrarily sell China's territorial sovereignty," "The four big families of China are high above, ruling all other people and all ethnic groups."

Chapter II (Articles 7 to 24) is "The Rights and Obligations of the People." From Articles 7 to 22, it vaguely stipulates that "all people are equal before the law regardless of gender, race, religion, class, or party affiliation," and also passively stipulates that they have freedom of person, residence, movement, speech, publication, religious belief, assembly, and association. But then comes Article 23: "The freedoms and rights listed above shall not be restricted by law except when necessary to prevent interference with the freedom of others, avoid imminent danger, maintain social order, or promote public interest." In the end, the so-called freedoms and rights of the people are still crossed out with a stroke of the pen. Under the system of autocratic rule, is not the so-called "social order" and "public interest" precisely the "order" and "interests" of the autocrat and the big landlords and comprador class he represents! Is not the so-called "freedom of others" precisely the freedom of the autocrat to practice fascist terror! Is not the so-called "imminent danger" precisely the "danger" to the dictatorial rule! The pseudo-constitution does not mention the freedom that the people should have: freedom from want and freedom from fear. Regarding personal freedom, the pseudo-constitution also provides some "guarantees," but they are also very hypocritical. "No one shall be arrested or detained except by judicial or police organs in accordance with legal procedures, and no one shall be interrogated or punished except by a court in accordance with legal procedures." "When a person suffers illegal arrest or detention by any organ, he or she or another person may petition the court to investigate." Under a dictatorial system, who controls the judicial and police organs? Who stipulates the "legal procedures?" After being illegally arrested and detained, the person has no freedom at all, and may even be killed immediately. How can he or she petition the court to investigate? In a situation where people are often quietly taken away by special agents and suddenly declared "missing," on what basis can "another person" petition the court to investigate? Who should the court investigate? What if the investigation yields no results? The principle of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) draft constitution revision is: "All freedoms and rights that the people of a democratic country should enjoy shall be guaranteed by the constitution and shall not be illegally violated." This principle cannot be found in the pseudo-constitution.

Chapter III (Articles 25 to 34) is the "National Assembly." It stipulates that the National Assembly "represents the national people in exercising political power"; its functions are to elect and recall the president and vice president, to reconsider amendments to the constitution proposed by the Legislative Yuan, and it can exercise the power of initiative and referendum on general laws. National Assembly representatives are re-elected every six years; the National Assembly meets at the location of the central government. These provisions clearly violate the PCC principles: "All the people exercise four powers known as the National Assembly." "Before the implementation of the universal presidential election system, the president shall be elected by an electoral body composed of county-level, provincial-level, and central assemblies." Sun Yat-sen also said in Chapter VI of "Psychological Reconstruction": "After the constitution is formulated, the people of each county shall vote to elect the president..." The declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang also stated: "The people shall directly exercise the powers of initiative, referendum, and recall by means of people's assemblies and general voting." The pseudo-constitution creates a tangible "National Assembly," where "national representatives" go to the location of the central government to exercise four powers in a large hall, and can only exercise them once every six years. This deprives the people of direct democracy, creates the special privilege of "national representatives" over the people. The pretty words spoken by "national representatives" during the election campaign are not fulfilled, and they even sell themselves to privileged individuals, bureaucrats, and the comprador class. The people can do nothing about it, and can only re-elect them after six years. A National Assembly that meets once every six years cannot effectively oversee the ordinary administration of the government. However, through this tangible "National Assembly," the Legislative Yuan elected by the people becomes a mere formality, making it easier for the president and the president of the Executive Yuan to become dictators, and reducing the Legislative Yuan to a technical organ under the control of the president.

Article 26, regarding the representatives of the National Assembly, besides deceiving the Mongol and Tibetan nationalities, ignores other nationalities, with only one sentence: "The number of representatives elected by various ethnic groups in the border areas shall be determined by law." This openly denies the ethnic status of the Hui and other minority nationalities who do not live in the border areas.

The pseudo-constitution places special emphasis on the president, devoting a special chapter (Chapter IV) to it, and listing eighteen articles (from Article 25 to Article 52). Article 36: "The President commands the land, sea, and air forces of the entire nation." Article 38: "The President exercises the power to conclude treaties and declare war and make peace in accordance with this Constitution." Article 39: "The President declares martial law in accordance with the law, but must be approved or ratified by the Legislative Yuan." (Since there is "ratification," it shows that martial law can be declared without the consent of the Legislative Yuan.) Article 41: "The President appoints and removes civil and military officials in accordance with the law." Article 43 also stipulates the president's power to issue "emergency decrees." Look at how majestic and awe-inspiring the president is! Is this not a great dictator? What is even more wonderful is Article 44: "For disputes between the various Yuans, except as provided for in this Constitution, the President may convene a meeting of the presidents of the relevant Yuans to resolve them." In this way, the president is like a great emperor sitting high on the throne, and all "decisions" must be "judged before the emperor." What is said about the separation of five powers is just a facade, the great power is in the hands of one person!

Chapter V (Articles 53 to 61) is the "Executive." Article 53: "The Executive Yuan is the highest administrative organ of the state." In fact, there is also a "highest" president who also exercises administrative power. According to the PCC principle: The Executive Yuan should be responsible to the Legislative Yuan. If the Legislative Yuan expresses a vote of no confidence in the entire Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan shall either resign or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, but the same president of the Executive Yuan shall not request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan again. However, Article 57 of the pseudo-constitution states: "The Executive Yuan shall be responsible to the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the following provisions: (1) The Executive Yuan has the responsibility to submit policy guidelines and policy reports to the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Legislative Yuan have the right to question the president of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan during meetings. (2) If the Legislative Yuan does not approve of the important policies of the Executive Yuan, it may pass a resolution requesting the Executive Yuan to change them. The Executive Yuan may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider the resolution. If two-thirds of the members of the Legislative Yuan present maintain the original resolution upon reconsideration, the president of the Executive Yuan shall immediately accept the resolution or resign. (3) If the Executive Yuan believes that the laws, budgets, or treaties resolved by the Legislative Yuan are difficult to implement, it may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider the resolution within ten days of its delivery to the Executive Yuan. If two-thirds of the members of the Legislative Yuan present maintain the original resolution upon reconsideration, the president of the Executive Yuan shall immediately accept the resolution or resign." This is equivalent to saying that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the President and not to the Legislative Yuan. The executive branch does not obey the legislative branch, which means it does not obey the people. The President and the Executive Yuan are above the Legislative Yuan, the organ of the people's representatives, forming a special power system and a special professional bureaucratic system, acting arbitrarily and no one can interfere.

Chapter VI (Articles 62 to 76) is the "Legislature." Article 62: "The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative organ of the state, organized by members of the Legislative Yuan elected by the people…" In reality, the word "highest" here is also false. Article 72 stipulates: "After the Legislative Yuan passes a bill, it shall be sent to the President and the Executive Yuan. The President shall promulgate it within ten days of receipt, and handle it in accordance with the provisions of Article 57." This means that the power to veto any resolution of the Legislative Yuan is still controlled by the President. According to Article 57, the Legislative Yuan must have two-thirds of the members present to maintain the original resolution in order to resist the President's veto. In the Legislative Yuan, where Chiang Kai-shek's lackeys occupy the majority, it is impossible to reach this two-thirds majority unanimously. According to the PCC principle: The Legislative Yuan shall be directly elected by the voters, and its functions are equivalent to the parliament of various democratic countries. The pseudo-constitution completely overthrows this principle, overthrows the Legislative Yuan's power of no confidence in the Executive Yuan, which means it cancels the power of the Legislative Yuan equivalent to that of a parliament. Regarding the election of members of the Legislative Yuan, the pseudo-constitution also ignores the ethnic status of the Hui and other non-border ethnic groups.

Chapter VII (Articles 77 to 82) is the "Judiciary." It says: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the state," "Judges shall conduct independent trials based on the law beyond party affiliation and shall not be subject to any interference." In reality, these are also false: because the president of the Judicial Yuan and the grand justices are to be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan. Since the dictator will not give up the rule of special agents, the power of the judicial system will always be undermined by dictatorial violence. When even the "Constitution" is still dictatorial in nature, the general laws must also be made according to the convenience of the dictator's rule, and the "judges" are also made according to the model required by the dictator. It is impossible for them to be absolutely "beyond party affiliation" in practice.

Chapter VIII (Articles 83 to 89) is the "Examination." It also says: The Examination Yuan is the "highest" examination organ of the state, in charge of examinations, preparation, qualification, performance appraisal, rank salary, promotion, commendation, pension, retirement, and old-age care. It stipulates that the president and members of the Examination Yuan are also nominated and appointed by the President. But it also hypocritically stipulates that "members of the Examination Yuan shall exercise their powers independently based on the law beyond party affiliation." Since the president, who is a great dictator, is not "beyond party affiliation," can the members of the Examination Yuan nominated and appointed by him be "beyond party affiliation?" Under a dictatorial system, the selection of civil servants is not all for the purpose of making them his tools of rule, and the standards set for examinations and "appointment, qualification, performance appraisal..." must also be determined according to the needs of the dictator.

Chapter IX (Articles 90 to 106) is the "Control." According to the PCC principle: The Control Yuan should be elected by the provincial assemblies and the assemblies of various ethnic autonomous regions. Its role, in addition to supervising administrative and other organs, also reflects the special interests of various provinces and ethnic autonomous regions. However, Article 91 of the pseudo-constitution states: "Members of the Control Yuan shall be elected by the provincial and municipal assemblies, the local assemblies of Mongolia and Tibet, and overseas Chinese organizations..." Here, it does not recognize Mongolia and Tibet as ethnic groups at all, but only says "local," and does not mention the Hui, Miao, and other minority ethnic groups at all. Article 100: "The Control Yuan's power to impeach the President and Vice President shall require the proposal of more than one-fourth of all members of the Control Yuan, the review and resolution of more than half of all members of the Control Yuan, and shall be submitted to the National Assembly." This is equivalent to the Control Yuan not having the power to impeach the President; the National Assembly only meets once every six years, and it is not easy to hold temporary meetings, and representatives from all over the country have to go to the "location of the central government"!

Chapter X (Articles 107 to 111) is the "Powers of the Central and Local Governments." Article 107 first lists a large number of matters that are "legislated and executed by the central government," and Article 108 lists a large number of matters (including "General Principles of Provincial and County Autonomy," administrative divisions, forestry, industry, commerce, mining, education system, banking and exchange system, shipping and fishing, all public utilities, cooperative undertakings, transportation undertakings, qualification, appointment, and supervision of local officials, labor law and other social legislation, land law, police system, public health, relief and welfare...) are also "legislated and executed by the central government," only dragging a tail behind it: "or executed by the provinces and counties." It stipulates that provinces can formulate separate regulations, but also stipulates that "they shall not conflict with national laws." In this way, after the province formulates separate regulations, the central government revises or adds laws, which can invalidate the province's separate regulations at any time. The pseudo-constitution leaves so few matters for the provinces and counties to legislate and execute! Local autonomy and the equalization of power between the central and local governments are thus abolished. The position of the province, which should be the highest unit of local autonomy, in the pseudo-constitution is still the same as the position of the province as an administrative region of the state. Article 111 stipulates that in addition to the matters listed in Articles 107 to 110, "if unlisted matters occur, those whose affairs have a national nature belong to the province, and those whose affairs have the nature of a county belong to the county; in case of dispute, it shall be resolved by the Legislative Yuan." From here, it can also be seen that the pseudo-constitution is based on centralism, not local autonomy. It does not assign matters that the province can handle to the province, but "bestows" matters that the central government does not want to the province, and when there is a "dispute," it must be "resolved" by the central government. The province's obligation is only to follow the laws and orders formulated by the central government and help the dictator rule the people in various places. Even the personnel of the provincial government are "qualified and appointed" by the central government.

This can be seen more clearly in Chapter XI (Articles 112 to 128), "Local System": Article 112: "The province may convene a provincial people's assembly to formulate provincial autonomy laws based on the General Principles of Provincial and County Autonomy, but shall not conflict with the Constitution. The organization and election of the provincial people's representative assembly shall be determined by law." This means that the province cannot formulate a provincial constitution, but can only formulate a "provincial autonomy law" as one of the general laws, and even the "provincial autonomy law" must be formulated according to the "General Principles of Provincial and County Autonomy" formulated by the central government. Even the organization and election of the provincial people's representative assembly are stipulated by the central government by "law." There is also Article 114: "After the provincial autonomy law is formulated, it must be sent to the Judicial Yuan immediately. If the Judicial Yuan believes that there are unconstitutional provisions, it shall declare the unconstitutional provisions invalid." Article 115: "If a certain provision in the provincial autonomy law encounters major obstacles during its implementation, after the Judicial Yuan convenes relevant parties to express their opinions, the president of the Executive Yuan, the president of the Legislative Yuan, the president of the Judicial Yuan, the president of the Examination Yuan, and the president of the Control Yuan shall organize a committee, with the Judicial Yuan as the chairman, to propose a plan to resolve it." Is there still a bit of "autonomy" here? Also, Article 116: "Provincial regulations that conflict with national laws are invalid." Article 117: "If there is doubt as to whether provincial regulations conflict with national laws, it shall be interpreted by the Judicial Yuan." And the "provincial autonomy law" is only one type of "provincial regulations"; whether it conflicts with the Constitution and the laws formulated by the central government can only be determined by the central government unilaterally. Moreover, after the provincial autonomy law is formulated, the central government may formulate new laws, cancel a certain law, or revise a certain law, which may invalidate the "provincial autonomy law." The PCC principle: Determine the province as the highest unit of local autonomy, the division of powers between the province and the central government shall be stipulated in accordance with the principle of equalization of power, and the province may formulate a provincial constitution; these have all been abandoned by the pseudo-constitution.

The province has no autonomy, let alone the autonomy of minority nationalities. The pseudo-constitution only adds at the end of the first section "Province" of Chapter XI: "The autonomous system of various Mongol banners in Mongolia shall be determined by law." "The autonomous system of Tibet shall be guaranteed." How is the "law" "determined"? What is "guaranteed"? Obviously, it is just lip service. As for other minority nationalities, not a single word is mentioned. The PCC principle: The autonomous rights of minority nationalities living in a certain place should be guaranteed; no trace of this can be found in the pseudo-constitution. According to Wang Chonghui's report to the Chiang clique's Legislative Yuan, this article was personally crossed out by Chiang Kai-shek.

Chapter XII (Articles 129 to 136) is "Election, Recall, Initiative, and Referendum." These four items should have been completely direct democracy. However, since the pseudo-constitution raises a tangible "National Assembly" to elect and recall the president and vice president and exercise the powers of initiative and referendum, the people's universal, equal, and direct rights to elect, recall, initiate, and referendize are deprived. Article 130: "Citizens of the Republic of China who have reached the age of twenty have the right to vote in accordance with the law. Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution and laws, those who have reached the age of twenty-three have the right to be elected in accordance with the law." The age of voters is actually sufficient at eighteen (as the new Soviet constitution stipulates that the minimum age of voters is eighteen). As for the words "except as otherwise provided in the law" and "in accordance with the law," they give the dictator an excuse to deprive the people of their right to vote and be elected; because, under dictatorial rule, who knows how the "law" "stipulates," and who knows when there will be a new "law" formulated?

Chapter XIII (Articles 137 to 169) is "Basic National Policy." In the "National Defense" section, the principles of "separation of military and civilian affairs" and "governing the army with politics" in the PCC resolution are erased. The "Diplomacy" section only emptily says "protect the rights and interests of overseas Chinese, promote international cooperation...", but there are no provisions for protecting national sovereignty. The "National Economy" section only vaguely says that land legally acquired by the people should be protected by law, and cancels the principle of "land to the tiller" in the PCC's Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction; it passively says "the state should generally establish financial institutions for the common people to relieve unemployment," without guaranteeing people's employment; it emptily says "regulate capital," but does not stipulate the suppression of bureaucratic capital and the protection of national capital. The "Social Security" section for the improvement and protection of people's lives is at most a hypocritical pie in the sky, which can never satisfy hunger, and the dictator never intends to fulfill it. The "Education and Culture" section does not stipulate educating citizens with the spirit of democracy and guaranteeing the freedom of academic research, but only says "educational, cultural, and school organs and schools, public and private throughout the country, are subject to the supervision of the state." Under the dictatorial system of "I am the state," it naturally means being supervised by the autocrat. The "Border Areas" section also pretends to say "The state shall legally guarantee the status of various ethnic groups in the border areas." From the previous articles, it can be known that this is also empty talk. The entire "Basic National Policy" does not mention the policy towards all minority nationalities within the country, and the interests of minority nationalities who do not live in the "border areas" are drowned out by Han chauvinism in the pseudo-constitution. The PCC's Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction has been castrated into a cripple in the "Basic National Policy" of the pseudo-constitution.

Chapter XIV (Articles 170 to 175) is "Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution." Article 74: "The Constitution shall be amended in accordance with one of the following procedures: (1) It may be amended by the proposal of one-fifth of the total number of representatives of the National Assembly, the attendance of two-thirds, and the resolution of three-fourths of the representatives present. (2) A constitutional amendment proposal shall be drafted by the proposal of one-fourth of the members of the Legislative Yuan, the attendance of three-fourths, and the resolution of three-fourths of the members present, and shall be submitted to the National Assembly for reconsideration...." According to the PCC principle: "The power to amend the Constitution belongs to the joint meeting of the Legislative and Control Yuans, and the amended articles shall be submitted to the organ that elects the President for reconsideration." According to the PCC principle, the Control Yuan has the function of reflecting the special interests of various provinces and ethnic autonomous regions. Amending the draft constitution without going through the Control Yuan means ignoring the special interests of various provinces and ethnic autonomous regions. The PCC principle says: "Submit it to the organ that elects the president for reconsideration," which during the transitional period refers to the "election organ composed of county-level, provincial-level, and central assemblies," and in the future refers to the intangible National Assembly that implements universal direct elections, that is, all voters, and not the tangible "National Assembly" where "national representatives" go to a place to meet. Submitting the amendment of the Constitution to the so-called "National Representatives" for reconsideration instead of all voters reduces democracy too much, which is convenient for the dictator to tamper with the basic law of the country - the Constitution; this is too dangerous for the people of the whole country!

    大独裁者的护身符
    ——蒋记伪宪介绍
    燕凌
    去年十一月二十五日在蒋记非法国大“三读通过”的伪宪法，分为十四章，共计一百七十四条；但可以八个字概括尽之：人民无权，独夫专权。
    这部伪宪法一开头说是“中华民国国民大会受全体国民之付托，依据孙中山先生创立民国之遗教……制定本宪法，颁行全国，永矢咸遵。”而实际上“本宪法”只是受蒋介石一人之“付托”，依据蒋介石独夫的意思而“制定”的。第一章（第一条至第六条）是“总纲”，也是几句空话，说什么“中华民国基于三民主义为民有民治民享之共和国”，“中华民国之主权属于国民全体”，“中华民国之领土依其固有之疆域，非经国民大会之决议不得变更之”，“中华民国各民族一律平等”，………而实际上应读为“中国基于法西斯主义为蒋有蒋治蒋享之独裁制国家”，“中国之领土主权蒋介石可以随意出卖”，“中国四大家族高高居上，统治其他一切人民，一切民族”。
    第二章（第七条至第二十四条）是“人民之权利义务”。从第七条到二十二条，笼统的规定了“人民不分男女、种族、宗教、阶级、党派在法律上一律平等”，也消极地规定了有身体自由，有居住、迁移、言论、出版、信教、集会、结社等自由权利，但紧接着就来了一个第二十三条“以上列举之自由权利除为防止妨害他人自由，避免紧急危难，维持社会秩序或增进公共利益所必要者外，不得以法律限制之。”所谓人民的自由权利，结果还是一笔勾销了。在独夫专权的制度下，所谓“社会秩序”、“公共利益”还不正是独裁者及其所代表的大地主买办阶级的“秩序”与“利益”！所谓“他人自由”还不正是独裁者实行法西斯恐怖的自由！“紧急危难”还不正是独裁统治的“危难”！人民应有的不应匮乏与无所恐惧的自由，伪宪根本就没有提到。关于人身自由，伪宪也给了一些“保障”，可是也是非常虚伪的。“非经司法或警察机关依法定程序不得逮捕拘禁，非由法院依法定程序不得审问惩罚。”“人民遭受任何机关非法逮捕拘禁时，其本人或他人得向法院声请追究。”试问在独裁制度下，司法、警察机关是掌握在谁的手里呢？“法定程序”又是谁规定的呢？遭到非法逮捕拘禁后，本人什么自由也没有了，甚至立即被杀害了，又怎能向法院声请追究呢？在人民往往会被特务不声不响捉走而突告“失踪”的情形下，“他人”又能根据什么向法院声请追究呢？要法院向谁追究呢？追究不出结果又奈何？政协宪草修改原则是：凡民主国家人民应享之自由及权利，均应受宪法之保障，不受非法之侵犯”，这原则在伪宪里是找不到影子的。
    第三章（第二十五条至三十四条）是“国民大会”。规定了国民大会“代表全国国民行使政权”；它的职权是选举及罢免总统副总统，复决立法院所提宪法修正案，而且可以行使一般法律的创制恢复决权。国民大会代表每六年改选一次；国民大会开会地点在中央政府所在地。这些规定显然违背了政协原则“全国选民行使四权名之日国民大会。”“在未实行总统普选制前，总统由县级省级及中央议会合组选举机关选举之。”孙中山在“心理建设”第六章中也说过：“宪法制定后，由各县人民投票选举总统……。”在国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言中又说：“以人民集会及总投票之方法，直接行使创制、复决、罢免各权。”伪宪弄出来一个有形的“国民大会”，由“国民代表”到中央政府所在地去在一个大会堂中行使四权，而且每六年才能行使一次，这就剥夺了直接民权，产生了“国民代表”对人民的特权，“国民代表”在竞选时说的漂亮话不兑现，甚至卖身给特权者、官僚、买办阶级，人民也奈何不得，隔六年之久才能改选。六年开会一次的国大事实上是无法过问政府平常施政情形的，但却可借这个有形的“国大”，却使人民选举的立法院等于虚设，使总统与行政院长便于独裁，使立法院降为在总统操纵下的一个技术机关。
    第二十六条关于国民大会代表的规定，除了给蒙藏民族以欺骗之外，对其他民族是忽视的，只有一句“各民族在边疆地区选出之代表，其名额以法律定之。”这公然否认了回族及其他不居住在边疆的少数民族的民族地位。
    对于总统，伪宪是特别着重的，特别列为一章（第四章），而且罗列了十八条（从第二十五条到五十二条）。第三十六条“总统统率全国陆海空军。”第三十八条“总统依本宪法行使缔结条约及宣战媾和之权。”第三十九条“总统依法宣布戒严，但须经立法院之通过或追认。”（既有“追认”，可见不得立法院同意就可以戒严。）第四十一条“总统依法任免文武官员。”第四十三条并制定总统发布“紧急命令”的大权。看总统何等威风凛冽！这不是大独裁者是什么？更妙的是四十四条：“总统对于院与院间的争执，除本宪法规定者外，得召集有关各院院长会商解决之”，这样总统俨然是高踞宝座的大皇帝，一切“执”，都得“御前裁决”了。说什么五权分立，还不争是大权在于一人之手！
    第五章（第五十三至六十一条）是“行政”。第五十三条“行政院为国家最高行政机关。”其实，另有“最最高”的总统也操着行政权的。按照政协原则：行政院应对立法院负责，如立法院对行政院全体不信任时，行政院或辞职或提请总统解散立法院，但同一行政院长不得再提请解散立法院。而伪宪第五十七条却是“行政院依左列规定对立法院负责：（一）行政院有向立法院提出施政方针及施政报告之责，立法委员在开会时有向行政院长及行政院各部会首长质询之权。（二）立法院对于行政院之重要政策不赞同时得以决议移请行政院变更之，行政院对于立法院之决议得经总统之核可移请立法院复议，复议时如经出席立法委员三分之二维持原决议，行政院院长应即接受该决议或辞职。（三）行政院对于立法院决议之法律案、预算案、条约案如认为有窒碍难行时，得经总统之核可于该决议案送达行政院十日内移请立法院复议。复议时如经出席立法委员三分之二维持原案，行政院院长应即接受该决议或辞职。”这等于说行政院对总统负责而不对立法院负责，行政不服从立法，也就是不服从人民。总统与行政院在人民代表机关立法院之上，形成特殊权力系统，特殊的职业官僚制度，作威作福，无人能干涉。
    第六章（第六十二至七十六条）是“立法”。第六十二条“立法院为国家最高立法机关，由人民选择举之立法委员组织之。……”实际上这里所谓“最高”也是假的。第七十二条便规定了“立法院法律案通过后移送总统及行政院，总统应于收到后十日内公布之，依第五十七条之规定办理。”这就是说，对立法院的任何决议案，否决权还是操纵在总统手里的。依照第五十七条，立法院必须有出席人数三分之二维持原案，才得抵制得住总统的否决权。在蒋介石的喽＠占多数的立法院里，这三分之二的大多数一致就不可能达到。按照政协原则：立法院由选民直接选举之，其职权相当于各民主国家之议会。伪宪完全推翻了这一原则，推翻了立法院对行政院的不信任权，也就是说把立法院相当于议会的权力取消了。关于立法委员的选举，伪宪也漠视了回族等非边疆民族的民族地位。
    第七章（第七十七至八十二条）是“司法”。说：“司法院为国家最高司法机关”，“法官须超出党派以外依据法律独立审判，不受任何干涉。”实际上这些也是虚伪的：因为司法院长和大法官都要由总统提名经监察院同意而任命。独裁者既不会放弃特务统治，司法系统的权力在独裁暴力下总是要受破坏的。在连“宪法”都还是独裁性质的时候，一般的法律一定也都是依独裁者统治的方便而制作的，“法官”也是依独裁者所需要的模型制造出来的，要他们绝对“超出党派”在实际上是不可能的。
    第八章（第八十三至八十九条）是“考试”。也说：考试院为国家“最高”考试机关，掌理考试、备用、铨叙、考绩、级俸、升迁、褒奖、抚恤、退休、养老等事项。规定考试院长和委员也都是由总统提名任命。而却也虚伪的规定了“考试委员须超出党派以外依据法律独立行使职权”，作为大独裁者的总统既不是“超出党派以外”的，由他提名任命的考试委员就能“超出党派以外”吗？在独裁制度下，考选公务员还不都是为了给他作统治工具，所定的考试以及“任用、铨叙、考绩……”的标准也必然是依照独裁者的需要而定的。
    第九章（第九十至一○六条）是“监察”。依据政协原则：监察院应由各省级议会及各民族自治区议会选举之。作用除监察行政等机关外还反映各省及各民族自治区的特殊利益。而伪宪第九十一条却是：“监察委员由各省市议会、蒙古西藏地方议会及华侨团体选举之。……”这里根本不承认蒙、藏为民族，只说是“地方”，对回、苗等其他少数民族则根本没有提及。第一百条：“监察院对于总统副总统之弹劾权，须有全体监察委员四分之一以上之提议，全体监察委员过半数之审查及决议，向国民大会提出。”这等于监察院没有弹劾总统的权力；国民大会六年才开一次，开临时大会，又得全国各地代表都到“中央政府所在地”去，谈何容易！
    第十章（第一○七至一一一条）是“中央与地方之权限”。一○七条先列举了一大堆事项都“由中央立法并执行之”，一○八条又列举了一大堆事项（包括“省县自治通则”，行政区划、森林工商矿业、教育制度、银行及交易所制度，航业及渔业、一切公用事业、合作事业、交通事业、地方官吏之铨叙、任用、纠察，劳动法及其他社会立法、土地法、警察制度、公共卫生、振济抚恤……）也都“由中央立法执行之”，只在这后面拖上一条尾巴：“或交省县执行之”。规定省可以制定单行法规，却又规定了“不得抵触国家法律。”这样，省制定了单行法规后，中央又改订或增删了法律，就随时可以使省的单行法规无效。伪宪留给省县立法及执行的事项就少得这样可怜！地方自治、中央地方均权就这样被取消了。应作为地方自治最高的单位的省，在伪宪中的地位和作为国家的行政区域的省的地位仍然一样。第一百一十一条规定除一○七至一一○各条列举的事项外，“如有未列举事项发生时，其事务有全国一致之性质者属于省，有一县之性质者属于县；遇有争议时由立法院解决之。”从这里也就可以看到伪宪是以中央集权，而不是以地方自治为出发点的。不是把省能办的事都划给省办，而是把中央不要的事项“舍施”给省，而有“争议”时还得由中央“解决”。省的义务只是奉行中央制定的法律和命令，帮助独裁者在各地统治人民。连省政府的人员也都是由中央“铨叙任用”的。
    这在第十一章（第一一二至一二八条）“地方制度”里就可以看得更明白：第一一二条：“省得召集省民大会，依据省县自治通则制定省自治法，但不得与宪法抵触。省民代表大会之组织及选举以法律定之。”这就是说省不得制定省宪，只能制定作为普遍法律之一种的“省自治法”，就是“省自治法”也得依据中央所制定的“省县自治通则”而制定。连省民代表大会的组织和选举也都由中央以“法律”规定。还有第一一四条：“省自治法制定后须即送司法院，司法院如认为有违宪之处，应将违宪条文宣布无效。”第一一五条：“省自治法施行中如因其中某条发生重大障碍，经司法院召集有关方面陈述意见后，由行政院院长、立法院院长、司法院院长、考试院院长与监察院院长组织委员会，以司法院为主席提出方案解决之。”这里还有一点“自治”的气息吗？还有，第一一六条：“省法规与国家法律抵触者无效。”第一一七条：“省法规与国家法律有无抵触发生疑义时，由司法院解释之。”而“省自治法”不过是“省法规”的一种；它和宪法和中央制定的法律有无冲突，只有听凭中央单方面解释。而且，省自治法制定后中央再定出新法律，取消某法律或改定某法律都可能使“省自治法”无效。政协原则：确定省为地方自治之最高单位，省与中央权限之划分依照均权主义规定，省得制定省宪；这些都被伪宪摒弃了。
    省没有自治权，少数民族的自治权更不用说了。伪宪只在第十一章第一节“省”的末两条附加上“蒙古各蒙旗地方自治制度以法律定之。”“西藏自治制度应予保障。”“法律”怎样“定”？拿什么“保障”？显而易见，只不过是官面文章而已。至于其他少数民族，又是根本没有提到一个字。政协原则：聚居一定地方的少数民族，应保障其自治权；在伪宪中找不到一点痕迹。据王宠惠在蒋记立法院的报告，这一条是蒋介石亲手一笔勾销的。
    第十二章（第一二九至一三六条）是“选举罢免创制复决”。这四项原应该完全是直接民权。而伪宪既抬出一个有形的“国民大会”来选举与罢免总统副总统，及行使创制、复决之权，人民的普遍、平等、直接的选举权、罢免权和创制复决权就被剥夺了。第一三○条：“中华民国国民年满二十岁者有依法选举之权。除本宪法及法律别有规定者外，年满二十三岁者有依法被选举之权。”选举人的年龄，其实十八岁也就足够的了，（如苏联新宪法规定选民的最低年龄即为十八岁）。至于“法律别有规定者外”“依法”等字样，就更给独裁者以剥夺人民选举权与被选举权的借口；因为，在独裁统治下，鬼知道“法律”如何“规定”法，谁又知道什么时候会有什么新“法律”又制定了出来？
    第十三章（第一三七至一六九条）是“基本国策”。“国防”一节中，关于政协决议中的“军民分治”、与“以政治军”的原则是被抹去了。“外交”一节只空洞的说“保护侨民权益、促进国际合作……”，却没有保护国家主权的规定。“国民经济”一节只笼统的说人民依法取得之土地应受法律之保障，把政协的和平建国纲领中的“耕者有其田”的原则取消了；消极的说“国家应普设平民金融机构以救济失业”，而没有对于人民就业的保障；空洞的说“节制资本”，却不规定取缔官僚资本与保障民族资本。“社会安全”一节对于人民生活的改进与保障，顶多只是虚伪的画饼，永远不能充饥，独裁者也永不打算兑现的。“教育文化”一节对于以民主精神教育国民以及保障研究学术的自由等也没有规定，而只说“全国公私立之教育文化机关学校受国家之监督。”在“朕即国家”的独裁制度下，自然就是说受独夫的监督。“边疆地区”一节，还假猩猩的说什么“国家对于边疆地区各民族之地位应予合法之保障。”从以前的那些条文便可知道这也是空话。整个“基本国策”里，没有提到对国境内所有少数民族的政策，不在“边疆地区”住居的少数民族的利益，在伪宪中被大汉族主义淹没了。政协的和平建国纲领在伪宪的“基本国策”里被阉割得成为残废了。
    第十四章（第一七○至一七五条）是“宪法之施行及修改”。第七四条：“宪法之修改应依左列程序之一为之：（一）由国民大会代表总额五分之一之提议三分之二之出席及出席代表四分之三之决议得修改之。（二）由立法院立法委员四分之一之提议四分之三之出席及出席委员四分之三之决议拟定宪法修正案提请国民大会复决，……。”按照政协原则：“宪法修改权属于立法监察两院联席会议，修改之条文，应交选举总统之机关复决之。”依照政协原则，监察院有反映各省及各民族自治区的特殊利益的作用。修改宪草不经过监察院，也就是忽视各省及各民族自治区的特殊利益。政协原则所说：“交选举总统之机关复决”，在过渡期间是指“县级省级及中央议会合组”之选举机关，将来是指实行普遍直接选举的无形的国民大会，也就是全体选民，而不是指“国民代表”到一个地方开的有形的“国民大会”。修改宪法不交全体选民而交给所谓“国民代表”去复决，就把民主缩小得太多了，这正便于独裁者纂改国家的基本大法——宪法；对于全国人民，这太危险了！
