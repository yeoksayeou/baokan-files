　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. According to a Central News Agency report on the 3rd, Stuart had concluded his trip to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places, and returned to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 3rd. According to Shanghai newspapers, the main task of Stuart’s trip was "perhaps to eliminate the anti-American sentiment of students and intellectuals in South China." Stuart gave speeches in various places, all emphasizing that "the current enemy of China is internal." Stuart wanted students not to "use freedom," not to be "xenophobic," and even said that students should not have patriotic ideas, but should develop an "international concept" to achieve the "ideal" of "one family under heaven," openly demanding that the Chinese people endure the enslavement of China by American imperialism. Stuart wanted "those who have been educated in the United States to be the first to respond to this effort." Public opinion in Beijing and Shanghai believes that this only shows his ignorance of the degree of national awakening of the Chinese people. Appropriately, while Stuart was giving a speech in Shanghai, the National Student Anti-Aggression Association was actively preparing in Shanghai for a nationwide signature campaign demanding the complete departure of American troops and opposing the "Sino-US Commercial Treaty," which was also being enthusiastically carried out among students in Shanghai, Beiping, and other places.

　　司徒雷登华南之行妄图消弭反美情绪
    【新华社延安五日电】据中央社三日讯：司徒雷登已结束上海、广州、香港等地之行，于三日下午返抵南京。据沪报披露，司徒此行主要任务“或为消弭华南学生及知识分子之反美情绪。司徒曾在各地发表演讲，皆强调指出：“目前中国的敌人是内在的”，司徒要学生不要“利用自由”，不要“排外”，甚至说学生不能有爱国观念，而应养成“国际观念”，以达成“天下一家”之“理想”，公开要求中国人民忍受美帝国主义对中国之奴役。司徒要“曾在美国受过教育的人最先响应这种努力”。京沪舆论界认为此仅表现他对中国人民的民族觉醒程度的无知。适当司徒在沪演说同时，全国学生抗联会正在沪积极筹划中，要求美军全部离开及反对“中美商约”之全国性签名运动，亦在上海、北平等地学生中热烈进行。
