    The production and frugality campaign in our district has begun to penetrate the countryside. In Beiliuxun Village, Lin County, men guarantee not to smoke cigarettes, and women in Beiliu Village, Li County, propose precise calculations to avoid wasting even a mouthful of rice. These methods need to be vigorously promoted. It is necessary to widely mobilize the masses to set diligence and frugality plans to build wealth, so that every household engages in production and practices frugality. It is also necessary to help district and village cadres to carefully sort out village finances, establish sound village financial systems, promote hard work and thrift, self-denial and public service, and reduce the burden on the people. Only by leading and organizing the masses to get rich can we better support the front lines. Production and frugality in government offices have a great promotional and encouraging effect on the masses. In order to further develop this movement, government cadres must help the people in nearby villages and learn from the masses.

    组织群众勤俭发家
    本区生产节约运动，已开始深入农村。林县北捋寻村男人保证不吸纸烟，黎城北流村妇女提出精确计算，做到不浪费一口饭。这些办法需要大力推广。要广泛发动群众定勤俭发家计划，做到家家户户生产节约。还要帮助区村干部认真整理村财政，建立良好的村财政制度，提倡艰苦节约，克己奉公，减轻民负。只有领导、组织群众发家致富，才能更好地支援前线。机关生产节约对群众有很大推动鼓舞作用。为了这一运动得到更大开展，机关干部必须帮助附近群众工作，并向群众学习。
