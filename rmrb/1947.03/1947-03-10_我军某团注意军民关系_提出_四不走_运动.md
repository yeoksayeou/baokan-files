Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, March 8th: Reporter Li Pu reports: General Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious army constantly reminds subordinates to pay attention to civil-military relations. The political department of a certain regiment recently launched a "Four Don'ts Leave" movement, mobilizing troops to do four things before each march: (1) Don't leave until the landlord's water tank is full; (2) Don't leave until the ground is swept clean; (3) Don't leave until procedures are cleared; such as returning borrowed items, compensating for losses, settling accounts, etc.; (4) Don't leave until fortifications are dismantled. Each time when building fortifications, don't add soil unless in an emergency, so that they can be easily and quickly dismantled. When borrowing doors from villagers' carts, etc., be sure to instruct the owner to remember the location clearly, so that the owner can retrieve them himself in case of an emergency mission and there is no time to explain. The first three items were proposed by a reconnaissance company of another regiment. The regiment saw it in the "Comrades-in-Arms Report" of the troops, supplemented it, and added the fourth item. All the work of the Eighth Route Army is gradually developed through mutual learning in this way. General Liu Bocheng himself attaches great importance to the interests and feelings of the masses, and pays great attention to even daily trivial matters. For example, in some places in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, men and women have separate toilets and do not want to mix. After General Liu learned about this custom, every time he arrived in a place, he would order his subordinates to investigate clearly and write three large characters outside the women's toilet to avoid subordinates mistakenly entering.

　　我军某团注意军民关系
    提出“四不走”运动
    【本报冀鲁豫前线八日电】新华社记者李普导：刘伯承将军之常胜报军，经常提醒部属注意军民关系。某团政治处最近提出四不走运动，发动部队在每次行军之前做四件事：（一）房东的水缸挑不满不走；（二）地不扫干净不走；（三）手续不清不走；如送还借物，赔偿损失，结清账目等；（四）工事不拆不走，每次修筑工事时，非到紧急情况不加土，以便容易迅速拆除。借用老百姓的大车门板等，必须指引物主记清地点，以便万一接受紧急任务不及交代时，物主可以自己取回。其中前三项系另一团的侦察连所提出，某团从部队的战友报上看到，并加以补充，又加上第四项。八路军的一切工作，都是这样相互学习而逐渐发展起来。刘伯承将军本人对群众的利益和感情极为重视，虽日常小事亦甚加注意。如冀鲁豫有些地方男女各有厕所，不愿混杂，刘将军知道有这种风俗以后，每到一地，必令部下调查清楚在女厕所外面写上三个大字，以免部属误入。
