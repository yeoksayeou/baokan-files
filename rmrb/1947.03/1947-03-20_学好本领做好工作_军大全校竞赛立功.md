　　Study Hard to Master Skills and Do a Good Job
    Military University Launches School-Wide Competition to Earn Merits
    [This Newspaper Reports] The entire staff of the Military and Political University is actively cultivating a large number of military and political cadres to support the front lines of the self-defense war. In order to quickly master skills in training and go to the front lines, the students put forward the slogan "Earn merits on the study front." Everyone said, "To be a hero on the battlefield, first be a hero in learning." Getting up early and going to bed half an hour later is a common phenomenon. "Living alarm clocks" who lead other comrades to get up early and practice hard appear everywhere in the classes. Although the superiors have asked everyone to observe the time, shouts of killing often replace the bugle call for getting up. The Zhang Shoutian mutual aid group forgot to eat in order to break through a hidden bunker from the base of the wall; Xue Fugui fell into the barbed wire while climbing obstacles, tearing his pants and scratching his hands, but he continued to persevere. Even sick people were unwilling to miss a single movement. Sun Wen said, "My illness requires three months of rest, but now, in order to earn merits, I won't rest for a single day." Du Zhitao and Xu Weihua, who had just arrived at the school not long ago, had both served as regimental commanders in the Kuomintang army. Now they carry their bedrolls, do morning exercises, attend classes, get meals, fetch water, and sweep the floor like everyone else. Comrade Du Zhitao said, "I want to master my skills and defeat old Chiang, and make great contributions for the people." In terms of bayonet drill, the fourth and fifth detachments completed the basic and defensive movements in one week, achieving mastery of the essentials and accurate movements. The education plan required 80% accuracy in live ammunition shooting, but the fourth detachment achieved 92% accuracy, with an average of 12 rings per person. The second detachment achieved 90% accuracy, with an average of 13 rings per bullet. The obstacle course was 170 meters long, and the plan required it to be completed in 80 seconds. As a result, Comrade Zhang Shoutian created a record of 65 seconds. The whole team averaged 79 seconds, exceeding the plan. The first detachment, with all 93 members, collectively passed the course continuously in 4 minutes and 30 seconds, averaging 4.4 seconds per person. The results of grenade throwing were also extremely significant: the plan required an average of 30 meters per person for the political detachments and an average of 35 meters per person for the military detachments. As a result, the political detachments, such as the fifth detachment, averaged 32 meters, and the military detachments, such as the first detachment, averaged 38.3 meters per person. Shangguan Meiye initially only threw 25 meters, but after three weeks of hard training in order to earn merits, he threw 54.5 meters. Comrades in the Third District threw 55 meters.
    Cadre comrades put forward the slogan "Serve the students wholeheartedly" and wanted to "earn merits on the education front." They often stayed up until 12 o'clock to sleep because of student life and learning leadership issues. The shooting instructors taught and learned at the same time from the beginning of education, and never rested for a single day in a month. Comrade Chen Bo, the leader of the fifth detachment, never took off his clothes to sleep because he was guiding the students' learning late into the night. Vice Presidents Xu Erwei also often went to the detachments to participate in morning exercises and provide specific guidance.
    Administrative staff put forward the slogan "Do our job well, guarantee the students' good learning, and go out to kill more of Chiang Kai-shek's troops." Liang Zheng, the fifty-year-old cooking squad leader, challenged his squad, discussing the conditions sentence by sentence. They signed their names under the conditions, saying they would do what they said. Sure enough, the detachments never ate undercooked rice, and the dishes were delicious. One-third of the flour issued by the superiors was used by many units to adjust to one meal a day, with many varieties. Cook Miao Defu said: "If the students like to eat soft rice, I will make soft rice. I make rice by following the mass line." In terms of conservation, Wu Jinquan picked up even a piece of broken firewood and put it on the woodpile. The cooking squad of the second detachment also published a blackboard newspaper to praise their merits. The cooking squads of each detachment all ordered merit books and frequently recorded their merits. In the initial summary of the first stage of study, the first brigade alone recorded ten major merits, and the second detachment recorded more than fifty merits.

　　学好本领做好工作
    军大全校竞赛立功
    【本报讯】军政大学全体人员积极培养大批军政干部支援自卫战争前线。同学们为在练兵中赶快学好本领上前线，提出“在学习战线上立功”的口号，大家说：“要在战场上当英雄，先在学习上当英雄”。早起晚睡半小时是普遍现象，班里到处出现带领其他同志早起苦练的“活钟表”，虽然上级提出要遵守时间，可是杀声往往还是代替了起床号。张守田互助组为了从墙基下打通一个暗堡，忘记了吃饭；薛富奎爬障碍跌在铁丝网里挂破了裤子挂烂了手还是继续坚持，病员都不肯旷过一个动作，孙文说：“我的病要休息三个月，现在为了立功，一天也不休息。”刚到校不久的杜志韬、徐维华同志，都在国民党军队里当过团长，现在跟大家一样背着被包出操上课打饭打水扫地，杜志韬同志说：“我要把本领学好去打败老蒋，为人民立大功劳。”。在刺杀方面四、五队一周即学完了基本动作和防护动作，做到了掌握要领和动作确实。教育计划要求实弹射击百分之八十命中，结果四队命中百分之九十二，每人平均十二环。二队命中百分之九十，每弹平均十三环。超越障碍全长百七十米，计划要求八十秒完成，结果张守田同志创造了六十五秒的纪录，全队平均七十九秒超过了计划，一队全队九十三人集体连续通过共费时四分三十秒，每人平均四秒四。投弹成绩亦极显著：计划要求政治队每人平均三十米，军事队每人平均三十五米，结果政治队如五队平均三十二米，军事队如一队每人平均三十八米点三。上官美野，最初只投二十五米，为了立功，苦练三周后投到五十四米五，三区同志投弹五十五米。
    干部同志提出了“全心全意为学员服务”的口号，要“在教育战线上立功”。为了同学生活、学习领导问题常常熬到十二点才睡觉，射击教员从教育开始一面教一面学，一个月内从没休息过一天。五队队长陈波同志因为预导学习半夜没脱衣服睡过觉，徐二位副校长也常到各队参加操课具体指导。
    事务人员提出“作好自己工作，保证学员学习好，出去多杀蒋家军”的口号。五十岁的炊事班长梁政，向他的队挑战，一句句地讨论着条件，他们在条件的下面画了押，说到做到；真的各队从来没有吃过生饭，菜又可口，上级发的面是三分之一，不少单位调剂到一天一顿，花样多，炊事员苗得福说：“同学们喜欢吃软饭我做软饭，我做饭走群众路线”。在节约方面，吴金全见一根碎柴也拾到柴堆上，二队炊事班还出了黑板报进行表功，各队炊事班都订了立功簿，经常记功。在学习第一阶段初步总结时，单第一大队就记了十个大功，二队就记了五十多个功。
