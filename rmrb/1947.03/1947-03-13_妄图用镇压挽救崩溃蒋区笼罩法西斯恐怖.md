Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 11th: Comprehensive reports indicate that Chiang Kai-shek has begun to implement a fascist counter-revolutionary reign of terror.

　　This fascist terror was foreshadowed by the "February 5th" and "February 8th" bloodbaths in Chongqing; the "February 9th" massacre in Shanghai was a test case in Shanghai. Around the time of the withdrawal of the CCP delegation from the Military Mediation Department in mid-to-late February, over 2,400 citizens were arrested in Beiping, marking the official beginning of the widespread terror. This was followed by mass arrests in Shenyang, and the arrest of over 600 people in Suzhou between Shanghai and Nanjing, further probing the reactions of the people in Shanghai and Nanjing.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's fascist terror has clearly received support from the United States. U.S. Ambassador Stuart, during his ten-day "trip" that began in late last month, repeatedly delivered speeches in Shanghai and various parts of South China, claiming that China's "enemies" were "internal," referring to "destructive divisive activities," etc. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's remarks on strengthening aid to Chiang on February 16th further strengthened Chiang Kai-shek's determination to implement reactionary terror.

　　On February 17th and 28th, Chiang Kai-shek formally forced the CCP representatives and liaison personnel in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing to withdraw, and closed the New China Daily, Masses Magazine, and the New China branch offices in Nanjing and Chongqing. It was generally expected that Chiang Kai-shek would use the pretext of "suppressing the Communist Party" to cruelly suppress the patriotic and democratic movements of the people. According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 6th, "Fairly reliable indications show that the Kuomintang plans to launch a 'Communist suppression movement' after the withdrawal of Communist liaison personnel from major cities." Liberals in Shanghai are currently in a state of fear, which is further intensified by slogans appearing in the city center: "Down with the Red Bandits," "Down with Opponents of the Government."

　　According to news reports and dispatches, the first item in Chiang Kai-shek's terror plan is to massively arrest patriotic and liberal elements. Reuters revealed that a certain party "estimates" that there are 20,000 underground Communist Party members in Shanghai, which is a foreshadowing of Kuomintang special agents making mass arrests in every school, shop, and factory. At the same time, the Kuomintang authorities in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, after notifying the CCP liaison personnel in the three cities to withdraw, declared that they would "not be responsible for the protection" of local CCP members discovered thereafter. The Beiping Garrison Command also announced: "From now on, any unscrupulous elements lurking in this city to 'disrupt public order' or 'probe military and political information' will be regarded as rioters or spies and will be punished according to law upon discovery." This shows that the Chiang government is fabricating rumors in many ways to pave the way for the massive arrest of patriots and liberals.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's fascist "police district system" and "collective responsibility system," which completely deprive the people of their freedom, are also being actively promoted in various regions. The three towns of Wuhan have already begun to implement the "police district system" at the beginning of this month, and the "collective responsibility" method is also being implemented for public bureaus, employees, and soldiers in various regions. The Kuomintang Postal Administration has taken the lead in secretly ordering employees of post offices in various regions to implement "collective responsibility," stipulating that five people form a group, and if one person is "collectively responsible," the other four will be equally punished.

　　Patriotic and liberal public opinion organs are suffering unprecedented barbarous persecution. The China Democratic League newspaper and the Democracy Daily were forced to cease publication on the 3rd, and the Chengdu Huaxi Evening News also received warnings and threats. In Shanghai, according to a United Press report on the 6th, "According to newspapers controlled by the Chiang government, Shanghai's last remaining liberal newspapers, the United Evening News and Wenhui Daily, may soon be forced to cease publication 'due to a shortage of printing paper,'" but in reality, the two newspapers have a considerable amount of printing paper in Shanghai. Chiang Kai-shek's fascist atrocities will undoubtedly further lose popular support and force the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to rise up and wage a more resolute struggle.

### 妄图用镇压挽救崩溃蒋区笼罩法西斯恐怖

　　妄图用镇压挽救崩溃蒋区笼罩法西斯恐怖
    【新华社延安十一日电】综合报导：蒋介石已开始实行法西斯反革命大恐怖。
    这一法西斯大恐怖，系以重庆之“二、五”“二、八”两次血案为前导；上海“二、九”惨案，则为在上海之试探。二月中下旬，军调部中共代表团撤退前后，北平二千四百余市民被逮捕，则是大恐怖之正式开始。接着便在沈阳大捕人，上海、南京间的苏州六百余人的逮捕。便是对上海、南京人民的再试探。
    蒋介石法西斯恐怖显然获得美国方面的支持，美大使司徒于上月下旬开始的十天“旅行”中，曾在上海及华南各地一再发表演讲，所谓中国之“敌人”系“在内部”，如“破坏性之分裂活动”等。美新任国务卿马歇尔于上月十六日发表加强援蒋的谈话后，更使蒋介石决心进一步实行反动恐怖。
    上月十七日与二十八日，将介石正式迫令京、沪、渝三地中共代表及联络人员撤退，封闭新华日报、群众杂志及京渝两地新华分社，一般人都预料继此之后，蒋介石将借名“镇压共产党”，残酷的镇压人民爱国民主运动。据合众社上海六日电称：“相当确实的迹象，显示国民党计划在共产党联络人员自各大城市撤退后，发动“镇压共产党运动”，上海之自由主义分子刻正恐惶不安，这种恐怖又为市中心出现的标语所加强：“打倒赤匪”、“打倒反对政府者”。
    据报纸、电讯消息：蒋介石恐怖计划中之首先一项，即为大举逮捕爱国及自由主义分子。据路透社透露：某方“估计”上海之共产党秘密党员为二万人，此即国民党特务人员将在每一学校、商店、工厂大举捕人之预示。同时，京、沪、渝国民党当局于分别通知三地中共联络人员撤退后声称：以后发现中共地方党员“不负保护之责任”。“北平警备司令部亦宣布：“今后如有不肖之徒潜伏本市“扰乱治安秩序”、“刺探军政消息”，即视为暴徒或间谍，一经查获，决依法制裁”。此显示蒋政府正多方制造谰言，为大举逮捕爱国者及自由主义者伏笔。
    蒋介石完全剥夺人民自由的法西斯“警管区制”及“连坐制度”亦积极在各地推行，武汉三镇本月初均已着手施行“警管区制”，各地公务局，职工及军人采用“连坐”之办法亦在进行。国民党邮政总局已首先密令各地邮局员工实行“连坐”，规定五人为一组，一人“连坐”其余四人皆被同等治罪。
    爱国的与自由主义的舆论机关，正遭受空前野蛮的迫害，民盟报纸及民主报于被迫于三日停刊，成都华西晚报亦受警告威吓。在上海方面，据合众社六日称：“据蒋政府控制下的报纸载称，上海硕果仅存之自由主义报纸联合晚报与文汇报，“由于印报纸的缺乏”，可能不久即被迫停刊”，但实际上两报在沪市存有不少印报纸的。蒋介石这种法西斯暴行，无疑的将更加丧尽民心，而逼迫蒋管区人民起而作更坚决的斗争。
