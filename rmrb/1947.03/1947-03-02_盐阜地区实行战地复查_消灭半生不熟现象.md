　　Salt-Fou Area Implements Wartime Review
    Eliminate Half-Baked Phenomena
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th] Since the land reform began in the Yancheng-Funing area of northern Jiangsu province in July last year, it has now been largely completed. According to preliminary statistics from seven counties including Huaian, Yancheng, Funing, and Sheyang, 1,110,000 landless and land-poor farmers have obtained more than 2 million mu of land. Among them, due to the Chiang army's offensive, the comprehensive land review was affected, some land contracts were not written, and public land was not distributed. Now, the Yancheng-Fou District Party Committee has issued instructions to strive to complete the wartime review before the spring plowing to eliminate the phenomenon of half-baked land reform.

　　盐阜地区实行战地复查
    消灭半生不熟现象
    【新华社华中二十七日电】苏北盐（城）阜（宁）地区自去年七月开始土地改革现已大部完成。据淮安、盐城、阜宁、射阳等七个县初步统计，一百十一万无地与少地农民获得田地两百余万亩。其中因蒋军进攻，致影响土地复查全面进行，部分地方契尚未写，公田未分。现盐阜区党委发出指示，争取春耕前完成战地复查，消灭半生不熟现象。
