(This newspaper's Jinnan Office, 17th) The Fourth Prefectural Committee (Nangong District) recently issued instructions to its subordinate counties to continue implementing the land reform re-examination, calling on them to earnestly overcome complacency and thoroughly eliminate feudalism. It first pointed out that: the main crisis in the current land reform re-examination movement is the complacent thinking that overestimates achievements. Without conducting in-depth and detailed investigations, it is assumed that land reform has been completed or basically completed; without truly estimating the degree of mass mobilization from the perspective of mass awakening, but seeing that 80 or 90 percent of the masses are organized in form, or even simply seeing the masses dancing the Yangko, it is assumed that they have been fully mobilized; without transforming production based on the degree of mass mobilization and the thoroughness of land reform, but rushing to transform production based only on a certain time (before spring plowing), all these ideas are optimistic estimates that are divorced from reality. Only by overcoming these ideas and conducting in-depth investigations to understand the situation can we continue to implement the land reform re-examination movement. According to our understanding, in the third district of Ningnan, the fruits have not been completely distributed in thirty-five villages, landlords have been omitted in twelve villages, and there are internal disputes in five villages. In the inner east district of Yaoshan, most villages have problems with struggling against middle peasants, and there are widespread problems with fruits. Cadres cheaply buy fruits, some village cadres are corrupt and enrich themselves, eat and drink extravagantly, and waste fruits. The militia team lives in good brick houses and does not allow the masses to distribute them, etc. Other counties also have similar problems. The instructions emphasized that the land reform movement is to overthrow thousands of years of feudal rule and to establish a new democratic order. This cannot be achieved by a short period of storm and cannot completely destroy feudal forces. It must be repeatedly checked to thoroughly eliminate feudalism.

　　克服麻痹自满彻底消灭封建
    冀南四地委指示各县
    【本报冀南十七日电】四地委（南宫区）近向所属各县发出继续贯彻翻身大检查指示，号召认真克服自满麻痹思想，彻底消灭封建。首先指出：目前翻身检查运动中的主要危机，是对成绩估计过高的自满麻痹思想，不去做深入细致的调查，就认为土地改革已经完成或基本上完成了；不去真正从群众的觉悟上估计群众的发动程度，而从形式上看到组织了群众的百分之八十或九十，甚至单看群众扭起秧歌来，就认为已经充分发动了；不去根据群众发动的程度、土地改革的彻底程度来转生产，而只是根据一定的时间（春耕前）急忙的转生产，所有这些思想都是脱离实际的乐观估计，只有克服了这些思想，深入的调查了解情况，才能继续贯彻翻身检查运动。根据我们了解，宁南三区有三十五个村果实没有完全分清，十二个村庄有遗漏地主，五个村有内部纠纷。尧山内东区大部分村庄有斗争中农问题，普遍有果实问题，干部贱买果实，一部村干贪污自肥大吃大喝浪费果实，民兵队住好砖房子不让群众分配等；其他各县也都有类似的问题。指示继强调翻身运动是推翻几千年来的封建统治，并且要建立一个新的民主秩序，这就决不是只经过短时期的暴风雨就能达到目的，就能彻底摧毁封建势力的，必须反复检查才能彻底消灭封建。
