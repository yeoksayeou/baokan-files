　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: According to a Shanghai dispatch on the 27th, since the Jiang government announced the method of changing the allocation of public education personnel to in-kind payments, teachers and staff of private secondary schools in Shanghai have also demanded in-kind allocations and launched a signature campaign. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Education Research Association, public and private schools both provide social education and make the same contributions, and the treatment should not be so disparate. For the welfare of teachers and staff in private middle schools throughout the city, the association has launched a signature campaign among teachers in middle schools throughout the city to unanimously submit requests to the Jiang-controlled Social Bureau and Education Bureau.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Hangzhou dispatch: All 500+ faculty and staff members of National Zhejiang University, due to soaring prices and inability to continue living, sent representatives Wang Guosong and two others to Nanjing on the 24th of last month to petition the Jiang government's Executive Yuan and Ministry of Education, demanding adjustments in treatment and that public education personnel should enjoy the welfare of daily necessities allocation.
