　　Introducing a Personal Production and Savings Plan

　　Among the personal production and savings plans of the Border Region Government机关, Comrade Shen Cunhua, the head of the accounting section, has developed a relatively specific one. It is worth everyone's reference and is introduced as follows:

　　(1) Production: 1. Complete a sweater of ten liang of wool yarn, which can be made into six sweaters. At a labor cost of one thousand yuan per piece, it can earn six thousand yuan. 2. Sew six sets of casual clothes (I saved a set of unlined clothing cloth last year, and first made one set as a model). According to the general tailoring wage of 80%, it can earn three thousand yuan. 3. Fight a "sparrow war" to plant fifty pumpkin plants. Each plant yields five jin, so two hundred and fifty jin can be harvested. At ten yuan per jin, it can earn two thousand five hundred yuan. 4. Participate in the agricultural brigade for the whole year and strive for twenty days. The minimum dividend per day is four hundred yuan, which can earn eight thousand yuan. 5. Strive to make a pair of shoes, with a profit of five hundred yuan. The rice obtained from the above, at sixty yuan per jin, can buy more than three hundred jin of rice. (Spinning was not specified at the time, but Comrade Shen has now learned it.)

　　(2) Savings: 1. Do not receive any allowances for cotton-padded clothes, unlined clothes, or quilts throughout the year. Do not ask for handmade money for socks, and save two pairs of shoes. 2. Use up the pen nibs, wipe them clean to prevent rusting, and do not use new pen nibs when not filling out forms. 3. Use waste paper as much as possible. (Xiushan)

　　介绍一个个人生产节约的计划
    边府机关的个人生产节约计划中，以会计科长申存华同志的订得比较具体，值得大家参考，特介绍如下：
    （一）生产：一、完成十斤毛线的毛衣，可打毛衣六件，每件工资一千元，可得六千元。二、缝便衣六套（去年自己存一套单衣布，先做成一身作榜样）按一般缝衣工资八扣可得三千元。三、打麻雀战种南瓜五十棵，每棵收五斤可收二百五十斤，每斤以十元计可得二千五百元。四、参加农业大队全年争取二十天，每日分红最低四百元计可得八千元。五、争取做鞋一双，得利五百元。以上所得米以六十元一斤计可购米三百余斤。（纺花当时未订，现申同志已学会。）
    （二）节约：一、全年津贴棉衣单衣被子完全不领。袜子不要手工钱，再节约鞋两双。二、笔尖用完擦净不让生锈，不填表不用新笔尖。三、尽量使用废纸。（秀山）
