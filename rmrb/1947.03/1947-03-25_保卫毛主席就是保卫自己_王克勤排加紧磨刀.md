    Defending Chairman Mao is Defending Ourselves
    Wang Keqin's Platoon Intensifies Sharpening of Knives
    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front, March 23rd by our correspondent Ke Gang] On the evening of March 19th, in a small village on the battlefield, inside the house where Wang Keqin's first squad was stationed, under a red banner embroidered with the seven large characters "Follow Wang Keqin's Direction," Wang Keqin led his entire platoon in holding a thought-sharing meeting.

    Wang Keqin: "Let's discuss, why should we defend Chairman Mao? If our thinking isn't clear, we won't fight well."

    Wang Jinshu: "I say defending Chairman Mao is defending ourselves. Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Yan'an is just a last-ditch struggle before his death. He definitely won't succeed!"

    "Report, I want to speak, I want to speak!" Many people clamored to speak.

    Wang Keqin: "Don't rush, don't all speak like Wang Jinshu. That's not useful. You have to say *why* defending Chairman Mao is defending yourselves. What's your relationship with Chairman Mao?"

    (A moment of silence)

    Li × Xiu: "Without Chairman Mao, my family wouldn't have been able to turn ourselves over, wouldn't have gotten our fruits; so I want to defend Chairman Mao. When defending Chairman Mao, I must perform meritorious service; because I'm a soldier of Wang Keqin's platoon, I can't let the platoon leader lose face."

    He Zongru: "I'll read my dad's letter, see if my thinking is clear." He took out a letter and read: "…Our family has turned over! Three and a half mu of land per person, no more worries about food and drink. In the army, you must only advance, never retreat. Our good times are given to us by Chairman Mao…" "I feel that if I don't work hard to defend Chairman Mao, I'll be letting my father down."

    Gao Wangao: "As long as Commander Liu gives the order, I'll be the first to rush up. I joined the army to defend my liberated interests; although I've been wounded twice, I haven't performed meritorious service yet. This time, to defend Chairman Mao, I must perform meritorious service."

    Cao Youlong: "I was liberated in the battle of Yutai; today at the mass meeting, I saw many common people go on stage to speak. This is something that never happened on Chiang Kai-shek's side. I saw in 'Tears of Blood' how Chiang Kai-shek conscripted soldiers just like when they grabbed me. My mother was also kneeling on the ground pulling at them, and they kicked her to the ground." He cried. "I want to defend Chairman Mao, I'm a poor man, I want to turn over and take revenge!"

    Huang Tiansong: "I'm from Fujian, also came from Yutai. I saw that the people here have food and clothing, and I remember that Chiang Kai-shek never did anything good for us there. Without Chairman Mao, China would perish."

    Ren Hexiao: "I won't say much, I'm determined to defend Chairman Mao and perform meritorious service. This is to protect myself, I don't care if I die. Only if Chairman Mao is safe can my family's future life be safe."

    "Report! I want to speak, I want to speak!" Again, many people clamored to speak.

    Li × Xiu: "I don't agree with him saying that he doesn't care if he dies. Since defending Chairman Mao is defending ourselves, what's the point of planning to die? Doesn't the platoon leader always say? We must improve our skills and find ways to kill the enemy, and only if we can live can we be heroes!"

    "That's right, that's right! We should sharpen our knives and improve our skills... As long as Commander Liu gives an order, our platoon will rush up to eliminate the enemy, only then can we defend Chairman Mao. If you think of dying first, how can you defend Chairman Mao?" Everyone in the room stood up, shouting. Yuan Kezhong, the photographer from the People's Pictorial Press, flashed his magnesium light, completely capturing the scene of Wang Keqin holding up his unsheathed battle knife—a platoon of soldiers who have clarified their thinking, strengthened their fighting spirit, and united more closely to prepare to annihilate more enemies.

### 保卫毛主席就是保卫自己  王克勤排加紧磨刀

    保卫毛主席就是保卫自己
    王克勤排加紧磨刀
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十三日电】本报记者柯岗报导：三月十九日夜晚，战地的小村，王克勤第一班住的屋子里，在绣着“走王克勤的方向”七个大字的一面红色大奖旗下边，王克勤领导全排战士们在开思想互助会。
    王克勤：“咱讨论讨论吧，为什么要保卫毛主席？大家思想要闹不通，就打不好仗。”
    王金书：“我说保卫毛主席就是保卫自己，蒋介石进攻延安不过是临死以前蹬了一下，他保险不沾！”
    “报告，我说，我说！”许多人争着说。
    王克勤：“不慌，你们不要都像王金书那样说，那不顶用，要说说为啥保卫毛主席就是保卫自己，你和毛主席有啥关系？”
    （沉默片刻）
    李×修：“没有毛主席，我家就翻不了身，得不到果实；所以我要保卫毛主席。在保卫毛主席的时候，我一定要立功；因为我是王克勤排的战士，不能给排长丢人。”
    何宗儒：“我念念我爹的信，你们看我思想通不通。”他拿出信来念：“………咱家翻身啦！一口人三亩半地，再不愁吃喝哪，你在队伍上只许前进，不许后退。咱的好时光是毛主席给咱的………”“我觉得不努力保卫毛主席，就对不起父亲。”
    高万告：“只要刘司令员下命令，我第一个冲上去，我是为了保卫翻身利益参军的；虽然我负伤两次了，可是还没有立功。这回为保卫毛主席，一定要立功。”
    曹有龙：“我是在鱼台打仗时被解放过来的；今天开大会，我看见很多老百姓都上台讲话，这是蒋介石那边从来没有的，我看见‘血泪仇’里边演的蒋介石抓壮丁就跟抓我时一样，俺娘也是跪在地下拉着，被他们一脚踢倒了。”他哭起来。“我要保卫毛主席，我是穷人，要翻身报仇！”
    黄天松：“我是福建人，也是打鱼台过来的，我看到这边老百姓有吃有穿，想起蒋介石在我们那里从没办过好事，要没有毛主席，中国就要亡国。”
    任合小：“我不多说，我决心保卫毛主席立功，这是为了保自己，我死了也没关系。只有毛主席平安，我家里以后的生活才能平安。”
    “报告！我说，我说！”又是许多人争着发言。
    李×修：“我不同意他说自己死了也没关系，既然保卫毛主席就是保卫自己，自己也要打算去死，那算个啥呢？排长不是常说吗？要提高技术想办法杀死敌人，自己能活着，才算英雄！”
    “对呀，对呀！我们应该好好磨刀提高技术，…………只要刘司令员一下命令，咱排就冲上去消灭敌人，那才能保卫毛主席，要是自己先想去死，那还能保卫毛主席？”全屋的人都站起来，嚷嚷着说。人民画报社的摄影记者袁克中同志的镁光轰然亮了一下，把王克勤所举起的这一把出了鞘的战刀——这一排明确了思想，更加强了斗志，更紧密地团结起来准备更多歼敌的战士，完全摄入镜头。
