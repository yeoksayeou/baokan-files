Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th: Wang Shumin, Chief of Staff of the 67th Brigade of the Chiang Army, who laid down his weapons in the Jin Southwest Campaign, revealed Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to eliminate dissidents. He said: "The 67th Brigade was only formed last summer by combining Sun Lianzhong's 31st Division of the former Northwest Army and Luo Zhuoying's 67th Division of Chiang's direct line. When Dong Zhao commanded five brigades to advance towards Puxian and Daning this time, when he discovered that he had fallen into the encirclement of the Eighth Route Army, he personally led his direct line troops to escape more than a hundred miles to Fenyang overnight, enabling us to retreat, but repeated telegrams for assistance were ineffective, and we were finally eliminated." Wang is a native of Wanping, Hebei, 35 years old, and has served as a staff officer in the 29th Army and Sun Lianzhong's department. Recalling the painful situation of the Northwest Army, he said: "Sun Lianzhong's department had two armies, four divisions, and one independent brigade, a total of eighteen regiments. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were always placed on the front line without replenishment. At the time of Japan's surrender, only one army, three divisions, and nine regiments remained. Last summer, it was reorganized into one division, three brigades, and five regiments. Last autumn, under the command of Hu Zongnan, when all of us attacked the Jin Southwest Liberated Area, we were placed in the most dangerous positions without assistance, and we suffered heavy losses. On the other hand, Hu Zongnan's department never fought in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, it only had one army and three divisions. After reorganization, it had more than twenty brigades, all equipped with the best weapons. The non-direct troops are so miserable compared with Chiang's direct line troops." Hu Fangzhen, Major General and Chief of Staff of the Yan Army's Jinxi General Command, also said: "When we were in critical combat, we telegraphed Dong Zhao six times to send troops to assist us, but he remained unmoved. In their (referring to Chiang Kai-shek, etc.) minds, it is the same whether we wipe out the Eighth Route Army or the Eighth Route Army wipes us out."

　　前西北军军官王树民氏谈
    蒋介石决心消灭杂牌
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】晋西南战役放下武器之蒋军六十七旅参谋长王树民揭发蒋介石消灭异己的阴谋，他说：“六十七旅于去年夏才由原西北军孙连仲之三十一师和蒋嫡系罗卓英部之六十七师合编而成，此次董钊指挥五个旅向蒲县、大宁前进，当他发现已陷入八路军包围时，便亲率嫡系连夜向汾阳逃出百余里才使我们撤退，连电求援无效，终被消灭。”王氏系河北宛平人，现年三十五岁，历任二十九军及孙连仲部参谋。他追述西北军痛苦的处境时说：“孙连仲部有两个军，四个师及一个独立旅，共十八个团，抗战期间总是摆在最前线，不给补充；日本投降时仅剩下一个军三个师九个团，去夏又整编为一师三个旅五个团；去秋在胡宗南指挥下全部进攻晋西南解放区时，把我们放在最危险的阵地，又不给援助，损失殆尽。反观胡宗南部八年抗战中从未打过仗，抗战初仅有一军三个师，整编后有二十多个旅，都是装备最优等的武器。杂牌军与蒋的嫡系相比就是这样悲惨。”阎军晋西总指挥部参谋长胡芳珍少将也说：“我们在作战危急时，曾六次电请董钊派兵援助，他都按兵不动，在他们（指蒋介石等）的心中，我们打掉八路军或八路军打掉我们总归都是一样。”
