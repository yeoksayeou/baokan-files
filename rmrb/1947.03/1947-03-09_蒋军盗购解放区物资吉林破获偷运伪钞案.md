　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th. In recent months, the Public Security Bureau of the Yi County Democratic Government in Jilin Province has successively uncovered several cases of smuggling counterfeit money. Investigation reveals that this is a planned and organized conspiracy by the Kuomintang reactionaries to steal supplies from the liberated areas, disrupt the financial system, and harm the people's livelihood. The main culprits, Li Tingkui, Zhao Shutai, Liu Qimin, and others, have now been arrested. According to Li Tingkui's confession: this conspiracy was directly instigated by the Chiang army headquarters in Shenyang, with Cui Taishan as the overall person in charge, and a liaison station was formed by a group of five people. Among them, a person named Quan Yishan has already exchanged 220,000 yuan of counterfeit Northeast Bank notes for supplies and fled back to Jilin. The first batch of counterfeit Northeast Bank notes transported from Shenyang amounted to 1 million yuan. After being transported to Jilin, they were escorted to the Jiang'an area by Chiang's military officers, and then smuggled into the liberated areas to steal supplies with these counterfeit notes. The "Yuan He" store, located on Caoshi Street in Jilin, specializes in liaison and transportation. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents use various methods to transport counterfeit money. The methods discovered in previous cases include hiding them under horse-drawn carriages, bundling them into cloth and yarn, and hollowing out bundles of superstitious paper offerings to hide them inside.
