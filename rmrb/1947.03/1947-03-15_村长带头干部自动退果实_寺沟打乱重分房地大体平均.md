　　Village Chief Leads Cadres to Voluntarily Return Profits
    S溝 Reorganizes and Re-divides Houses and Land, Achieving Basic Equality
    [Reported by this newspaper] Influenced and promoted by the village chief, Comrade Zhang Deqi, who first voluntarily returned the excessively distributed profits, cadres in Sigou Village, Xingtai County, successively returned their excessively distributed profits.  Furthermore, they uniformly redistributed and appropriately compensated for all the land and houses in the village, truly achieving a fair and reasonable distribution of profits for the entire village. After Comrade Zhang Deqi returned from a meeting in the county, he conducted a survey of the distribution of land and houses in the village and discovered that the distribution was unfair: out of the 120 households in the village, there were sixty-some courtyards, averaging one courtyard for every two families. However, his own family was allocated the best house of the landlord, and six or seven other cadres were also allocated a courtyard each, while some other households were allocated relatively cramped quarters. In terms of land, the amount of land held by hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants was roughly the same, with each person averaging 2.3 to 2.6 mu of land. However, in terms of quality, cadres and activists received more of the good land, while other poor peasants received more of the bad land, which was actually unfair. Therefore, at a mass meeting, Comrade Zhang Deqi proposed to everyone that a reasonable redistribution be carried out, and he took the lead in voluntarily returning the excessively allocated houses and good land. Other cadres who had excessively distributed profits also successively returned the excessively distributed houses and land. After detailed study by everyone, the houses were reorganized and uniformly redistributed, matched according to the number of people in each household, averaging one courtyard for every two families. Furthermore, livestock pens, stone rollers, and millstones were also appropriately distributed, so that every household had access to them. Since the land difference was not too great, it was no longer completely reorganized and redistributed, but the more than 30 mu of good land that had not yet been distributed was entirely distributed to households with less good land, averaging one mu of good land per household, and six fen of bad land were withdrawn. In this way, the amount of land remained largely unchanged, and the quality was roughly equal.

　　村长带头干部自动退果实
    寺沟打乱重分房地大体平均
    【本报讯】在村长张德奇同志首先自动退出多分果实的影响和推动下，邢台县寺沟村干部相继退出多分果实；并将全村土地、房屋做了统一的分配与适当的调补，使全村的果实分配真正达到了公平合理。张德奇同志从县里开会回去后，把全村土地、房屋的分配情形作了一个调查，发现分配不公：计全村一百二十户，有六十几院房子，平均两家人能分到一处院子。但他自己一家就分了地主的一院顶好的房子，其他六、七个干部，每家也都分了一个院子，另有些户分配的比较窄狭。在土地方面，雇、贫、中农的土地数量都差不多，每人都平均有了二亩三分到二亩六分土地；但从质量上来看，干部和积极分子分的好地多，其他贫农分的坏地多，实际上还是不平。因此，在群众会上，张德奇同志向大家提出，重新进行一次合理的分配，并首先自动将自己多分的房子和好地退出来；其他多分果实的干部，也纷纷把多分的房地退了出来。经过大家详细研究，将房子打乱统一重新分配，按各户口多少搭配起来，平均两家人分一处院子；并把牲口圈、碾盘、磨子等也作了适当的分配，家家都有的使用。土地相差尚不太远，就不再打乱重分，只是把尚未分的三十多亩好地，全部分给好地少的户，平均每户补上一亩好地，抽回六分坏地。这样一来，地的数目依然没有大的变化，质量也就差不多相等了。
