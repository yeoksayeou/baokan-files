Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning, March 21st: This agency's special correspondent analyzes the military situation in the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning area, stating: Over the past three months, the military and civilians throughout the region have actively engaged in self-defense and counter-attacks, achieving successive victories. In areas such as XXX (under Jianchang), Xinbozi (under Weichang), Yongle Xiji, and Anping Mafang (both on the sides of the Tianjin-Beijing Highway) alone, over 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops have been annihilated. The three major base areas of Eastern Hebei, Southern Rehe, and Western Liaoning are becoming increasingly consolidated. The fundamental changes during this period are: (1) The Chiang Kai-shek troops in the entire area, numbering approximately twenty-three regiments, are besieged in the thirty-two empty cities they occupy and along the iron railway line extending over 1,000 kilometers. The vast countryside remains under the control of the People's Liberation Army. (2) After the land reform, farmers in various localities enthusiastically joined the army, and the People's Liberation Army is growing stronger day by day, gradually entering active combat. The liberation of Anping, Yongle, Mafang, and other places on both sides of the Tianjin-Beijing Highway in February, and the raids into Tongxian and Wuqing, are clear evidence of this. The large and small bandit gangs that were incorporated and commissioned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops in various places have been successively eliminated, and the remaining small gangs are also in a state of struggling.

    冀热辽形势有显著变化
    我军进入主动作战
    【新华社冀热辽二十一日电】本社特派记者分析冀热辽区军事情势称：三个月来全区军民积极自卫反击，迭获胜利，仅在×××（建昌属）、新拨子（围场属）、永乐西集、安平马坊（均在平津公路两侧）等地即歼蒋军千余名，冀东、热南、辽西三大根据地日趋巩固。这一期间的基本变化是：（一）全区蒋军共约二十三个团，困守其侵占之三十二座空城及长达一千公里以上之铁路线，广大乡村仍为人民解放军所控制。（二）土地改革后各地农民踊跃参军，人民解放军日益壮大，已逐渐进入主动作战，二月份中解放平津公路两侧安平、永乐、马坊等地，袭入通县、武清即为明证。各地被蒋军收编加委之大小匪股已次第肃清，残余小股亦呈挣扎状态。
