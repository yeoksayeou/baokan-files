　　Political Education for New Soldiers
　　Nan Fei
　　First, one must understand that a peasant, accustomed to a scattered and individual rural life for many years, although voluntarily enlisting in the army during a mass upsurge of enthusiasm, still harbors various personal goals due to differing levels of awareness. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct essential political training, tailored to the thinking of new soldiers and practically combined with military training. During training, no fixed political textbooks should be prescribed. Generally, it can be carried out in the following steps, according to the developmental law of new soldiers' thinking:
　　I. At the beginning, it is necessary to carry out education to transform the motivation for joining the army and supplementary mobilization education for joining the army. New soldiers who enlist often have their bodies in the army, but their minds have not yet joined. They need to undergo arduous and even long-term supplementary mobilization education to stabilize. The methods of education are: one is to launch a frank self-reflection movement; the other is to launch a grievance-airing movement. The former is carried out when receiving new recruits, asking everyone to speak out about their ideological problems, family difficulties, etc., to help solve them, and to promote activists to take the lead in self-reflection, so as to achieve "knowing everything and saying everything without reservation." When brought back for training, take the company as a unit and find a few who suffered the most oppression and exploitation from landlords before emancipation to conduct typical grievance-airing, and introduce the living conditions of the people in the KMT-controlled areas, conduct comparative education, and enlighten their class consciousness. When necessary, a larger-scale grievance-airing meeting can be convened to ignite a wave of the movement with bitterness. Make the new soldiers understand why they should join the army and transform their motivation for joining the army.
　　II. Introduce the characteristics of the People's Army and the living conditions of the troops, appropriately coordinating with the education of democracy and discipline; tell them that officers and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army are equal, and it is forbidden to beat or scold them, and they can offer opinions to officers; the Eighth Route Army emphasizes unity, and veteran soldiers care for new soldiers. The Eighth Route Army cherishes the people, and the people support the Eighth Route Army, and the army and the people are one family. And compare Chiang Kai-shek's army with the People's Army, so that they feel that it is glorious to participate in their own army and do things for the people. Also tell them that a scattered life is not as good as a collective life, and to live a collective life, they must abide by the rules of collective life, just as the people must abide by government laws. At the same time, it is necessary to establish necessary living systems in the troops to prepare mentally and organizationally for intense large-scale military training. Make them establish feelings for the revolutionary army, and gradually replace feudal family feelings with the collective revolutionary feelings of the troops. This is an arduous task that must be carried out throughout the entire training process.
　　III. Repeatedly explain and solve the "fear of death" problem with the spirit of "survival." The "fear of death" ideology is the main obstacle to consolidating the morale of new soldiers and implementing various training programs. It is the biggest ideological burden for new soldiers after joining the army. We must vigorously break through this link. We must speak openly and not avoid it. The solution to this problem is to first affirm that war will cause death. Then, from our strategic and tactical military command, from the numerical comparison of casualties between the enemy and us, from the comparison of the total number of our army and the number of casualties, and from the key points of the human body that can cause death and very little physiological knowledge, repeatedly explain and tell concrete and vivid battle examples, such as the story of Regiment Commander Wu Zhong, so that new soldiers understand:
　　1. Victory naturally comes at a price, but our victory is achieved at a relatively small price. 2. If we want to avoid death, we can only kill the enemy who wants us to die, and turn the fear of death into hatred for the enemy. 3. Work hard to learn, practice skills, obey orders from superiors, and listen to commands, so as to reduce casualties. 4. Even if we sacrifice, it is supreme glory to die for the cause of people's liberation.
　　IV. Explain from the people's history of struggle: "We must win, we must win." We should seize the time to carry out current affairs education, combined with the facts of the oppression and suffering they personally experienced in the past, and the happy life after emancipation, explain that the present is a key moment in the life-and-death struggle close to the final victory. If we cannot win today, all past sacrifices and bloodshed will be in vain, and the future suffering is unimaginable. From the perspective of the comparison of strength between the enemy and us, conduct education to strengthen confidence in victory and see the prospects for victory. Some troops have edited and printed popular teaching materials based on the *Liberation Daily* editorial "On the War Situation" and referring to the Four Big Families of China for education, which has played a great role. The main thing is to encourage new soldiers to ask more questions themselves. They are very concerned about current affairs issues, especially the war situation, and will raise countless large and small questions, which should be answered patiently. This is much better than having cadres speak first.
　　V. Finally, introduce our regular army, propose meritorious service for the people, arouse the envy of new soldiers for the regular army, "Go to the regular army with American weapons!" Ask to join the regular army and test their learning achievements in practice.

　　对新战士的政治教育
    南飞
    首先应了解一个农民，长年习惯于分散的个体的农村生活，虽然在群众性的参军热潮中，自愿报名参军，但是由于觉悟程度高低不一，多数人还是抱着各种不同的个人目的，因此要针对着新战士的思想，实际结合着军事训练进行必要的政治训练。训练时，不规定什么固定的政治教材，一般说，可随着新战士的思想发展规律，按以下步骤去进行：
    一、开始时要进行改造入伍动机及参军的补助动员教育。新战士入伍，往往组织上参了军，思想上还没有参军，需要再经过艰苦的甚而长期的补助动员教育，才能稳定下来。教育的方法，一个是开展坦白反省运动；一个是开展诉苦运动。前者在接收新兵时进行，要大家把思想问题，家庭困难等都说出来，以帮助解决，并推动积极分子带头反省，做到“知无不言，言无不尽”。带回训练时，以连为单位找几个未翻身前最受地主压迫剥削的进行典型诉苦，并介绍蒋管区人民生活状况，对比教育，启发其阶级觉悟。必要时，可召集较大范围的诉苦会，以苦引苦，掀起运动热潮。使新战士了解为什么要参军，改造其入伍动机。
    二、介绍人民军队的特点，及部队生活状况，适当地配合着民主与纪律的教育；告诉他们八路军官兵平等，不准打骂，可以提官长的意见；八路军讲团结，老战士同新战士互相爱护。八路军爱护老百姓，老百姓拥护八路军，军民是一家人。并拿蒋介石军队与人民军队做对比，使其感到参加自己的军队，为人民做事，是光荣的。还要告诉他们，散漫生活没有集体生活好，过集体生活，就要遵守集体生活的规矩，像老百姓要遵守政府法令一样。同时应该建立部队中必要的生活制度，为紧张的大练兵作精神与组织的准备。使他们建立革命军队的感情，以部队的集体的革命感情、逐渐代替家庭的封建感情。这是一件艰苦的工作，要贯串于全部训练过程中。
    三、反复以“求生”的精神解释和解决“怕死”问题。“怕死”思想是巩固新战士情绪、实施各种训练的主要障碍，是新战士入伍后最大的思想包袱，要大力突破这个环节，要公开说通，不能避讳不谈。解决这个问题的办法，首先要肯定打仗是会死人的。然后从我们的战略战术军事指挥上，从敌我战斗伤亡的数字对比上，从我军总数与伤亡数的对比上，从人身上能致死命的要点和很少的生理知识上，来反复说明并讲述具体的生动的战斗实例，如吴忠团长的故事，使新战士了解到：
    １、胜利自然要付代价，但我们的胜利，是以较小的代价取得的。２、我们要想不死，只有把要我们死的敌人打死，把怕死心理转向对敌人的仇恨。３、努力学习，练好本事，服从上级命令，听指挥，就可以减少伤亡。４、即使牺牲了，为人民解放事业而死，是无上的光荣。
    四、从人民的斗争历史上说明：“我们一定要胜利，我们不胜利就不行”，应抓紧进行时事教育，结合着他们过去在实际生活中亲身受到压迫痛苦的事实，及翻身后的美满生活，说明目前是接近最后胜利的生死斗争关键，今天不能胜利，过去所有的牺牲流血，都成白费，将来的痛苦，更不可想像。从敌我力量对比方面，进行教育，坚定胜利信心，看到胜利前途，有些部队曾根据解放日报社论“论战局”“战局在开始变动”，参考着中国四大家族，编印通俗教材进行教育，起了很大作用。主要的，还启发新战士自己多提问题，他们对时事问题，特别是战争情况很关心，会提出无数的大小问题，要给以耐心解答，这样比先由干部去讲，要好得多。
    五、最后要介绍我们的正规军，提出为人民立功，引起新战士对正规军的羡慕，“到正规军用美式武器去！”要求参加正规军，从实际中测验自己的学习成绩。
