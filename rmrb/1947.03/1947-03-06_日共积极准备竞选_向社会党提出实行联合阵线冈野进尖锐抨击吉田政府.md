　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) is actively preparing for the election campaign to be held in late April. JCP General Secretary Kyuichi Tokuda declared on the 28th that the JCP plans to nominate 150 to 170 candidates, 30 of whom will be women. JCP leaders and Mrs. Nozaka Tetsu (i.e., Okano Susumu), who recently arrived from the Soviet Union, will participate in the election. Tokuda also stated that in last year's election, the JCP won two million votes and six seats; in this election, it will win more seats, at least 40 to 50. In the past year, the JCP's membership has increased from 6,800 to the current 70,000; at the beginning of January this year, when the JCP Congress was held, it was 59,000. Tokuda also stated that all formal party members have persuaded their family relatives to elect JCP candidates and have also requested that party sympathizers take the same action. Another JCP spokesperson announced on the same day that JCP General Secretary Tokuda will send a letter to Tetsuo Katayama, chairman of the executive committee of the Socialist Party, calling for cooperation in the upcoming general election to eliminate the conservatives in the government and realize the return of power to the people. The spokesperson also listed nine policies for which they are willing to cooperate with the Socialist Party, including the implementation of nationwide democratic control over all banks and basic industries, as well as land reform. The right-wing elements of the Socialist Party refused to cooperate with the JCP, while the left-wing elements, with the strong support of the JCP, opposed the re-election of Heano as chairman of the "Election Planning Committee," otherwise, they will implement a boycott in the general election.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 4th: Tokyo Dispatch: The JCP's active preparations for the next general election continue. JCP leaders Nozaka Tetsu and Shiga formally proposed to Socialist Party leaders Mizutani and others on the afternoon of the 2nd to cooperate in the upcoming election and implement a united front. Nozaka Tetsu pointed out that the approaching election will be "a struggle between democratic and conservative forces," emphasizing the necessity of a united front between the two parties to resist conservative parties. Mizutani assured the two JCP leaders that he would submit the proposal to the party's next Central Executive Committee. However, the Socialist Party's consistent attitude is to advocate the so-called "independent line." At the same time, the JCP is currently holding training courses in Tokyo for election campaigns. Nozaka Tetsu is the main speaker, studying methods of election campaigning. 400 JCP youth members are being trained for three weeks. It is reported that Nozaka Tetsu pointed out in his speech: "I will go down to promote, so that the masses can understand, to explain clearly to old women, women... and must answer all questions." Banners hanging in the classroom include "Down with the black market and inflation government that harms the country and the people" and "Realize a government of the working people through a democratic people's front."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: TASS Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Communist Party leader Nozaka Tetsu (Okano Susumu) delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, sharply criticizing the Yoshida government and denouncing it for failing to meet any of the demands put forward by government and municipal officials and employees. Nozaka pointed out that under these circumstances, it is only natural that transportation and national railway employees, as well as government and municipal officials and employees, continue to wage anti-government struggles. Nozaka concluded that the basic way to overcome the current crisis is for the Yoshida cabinet to resign immediately.

　　日共积极准备竞选
    向社会党提出实行联合阵线冈野进尖锐抨击吉田政府
    【新华社延安三日电】东京讯：日共已积极准备于四月下旬举行的大选之竞选运动。日共总书记德田球一于二十八日宣称：日共准备提出一百五十至一百七十名候选人，其中有三十名为妇女。日共各领袖及目前自苏联来之野坂铁（即冈野进）夫人均将参加竞选。德田并称：去年选举中，日共获二百万选票，得六个议席；这次选举中，将获更多的议席，至少是四十至五十席。在过去一年中，日共党员由六千八百人增至现在的七万人；今年一月初，日共代表大会召开时，为五万九千人。德田又称：一切正式党员已劝说其家庭亲属选举日共候选人，亦已请求党的同情者采取同样行动。另一日共发言人同日宣布：日共总书记德田将致函社会党执委会主席片山哲，吁请在未来大选中合作，以铲除政府中的保守派，而实现还政于民。该发言人并列举愿与社会党合作之九项政策，其中包括对一切银行基本工业实施全国性的民主管制，以及土地改革。社会党之右派分子拒绝与日共合作，左派分子获日共之强力支持，而反对右派分子平野留任“选举计划委员会”主席，否则将在大选中实行抵制。
    【新华社延安四日电】东京讯：日共对下届大选之积极准备工作继续在开展中。日共领袖野坂铁与志贺已于二日下午正式向社会党领袖水谷等提出在即将到来选举中合作，实行联合阵线的建议。野坂铁指出：迫近的选举将为“民主与保守力量之间的斗争”，强调两党实行联合以反抗保守政党的必要。水谷向两位日共领袖保证将建议提交该党下届中执委。但社会党一向的态度是赞成所谓“独立路线”的。与此同时，日共现正在东京举办进行竞选运动的训练班，由野坂铁主讲研究竞选运动的方法，受训者有日共青年党员四百人，时间为三周。据悉，野坂铁在讲演中指出：“我要下去宣传，使群众都了解，要和老太婆、妇女……清楚的解释，必须答复一切问题。”课堂中悬挂之标语有“打倒祸国殃民的黑市和通货膨胀的政府”、“通过民主人民阵线实现劳动人民的政府”。
    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社东京讯：日本共产党领袖野坂铁（冈野进）在众议院发表演说，尖锐抨击吉田政府，并斥责吉田政府未曾满足政府及市政机关工人和雇员所提出的任何要求。野坂指出：在这种情形下，交通和国营铁路雇员及政府和市政机关雇员继续进行反政府斗争，自属当然。野坂结语称：克服目前危机的基本办法，是吉田间立即辞职。
