　　Linfen Guerrilla Battalion Kills Enemies Within Grid Networks
    ——Taiyue Military Region Commends
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 28th] The Taiyue Military Region issued a commendation on the 23rd for the Linfen Guerrilla Battalion. On the 15th, nine enemies from Goose House Village (20 li south of Linfen) went to Naxi Village (10 li south of Xiandi County) for activities. They were discovered by our Linfen Battalion, which immediately surrounded the village. One enemy was killed, five were captured, and one grenade launcher and four rifles were seized. On the 16th, more than 50 enemies from Hou Village (5 li west of Xiandi County) went to Xichenghuang to plunder. The battalion immediately pursued them and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy at Shangguan Village (20 li southeast of Linfen). Three enemies were killed, eleven were captured, and one light machine gun and eight rifles were seized, without any losses on our side. This battalion's proactive attacks, penetrating deep behind enemy lines, seeking opportunities, and continuous combat to annihilate the enemy's living forces is an exemplary spirit worthy of study throughout the region.

　　临汾游击大队格子网内杀敌
    ——太岳军区通令表扬
    【本报太岳二十八日电】太岳军区于二十三日通令表扬临汾游击大队，十五日鹅舍村（临汾南二十里）敌九名，到南席村（县底南十里）活动，被我临汾大队发觉，即将该村敌包围，毙敌一人，俘五人，获掷弹筒一个，步枪四支。十六日候村（县底西五里）敌五十余到西程皇抢掠，该大队立即前往追击，至上官村（临汾东南二十里）与敌激战，毙敌三人，俘十一人，缴轻机枪一挺，步枪八支，我无损失。该大队这种主动出击，深入敌后，寻找机会，连续作战，求得歼灭敌人有生力量；这一模范精神，值得全区学习。
