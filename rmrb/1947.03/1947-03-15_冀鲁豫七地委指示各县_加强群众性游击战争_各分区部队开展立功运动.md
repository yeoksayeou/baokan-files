The Seventh Prefectural Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Directs All Counties
　　To Strengthen Mass Guerrilla Warfare
　　Troops in All Military Sub-districts Launch a Merit Campaign
　　[Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 14th Dispatch] The Seventh Prefectural Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, in order to overcome some shortcomings discovered in the preparedness inspection, has instructed all counties to strengthen the viewpoint of relying on the masses, strengthen village-level mobilization, and launch mass guerrilla warfare. The Seventh Prefectural Committee discovered in its preparedness investigation that there are two problems in the development and improvement of guerrilla warfare in some village areas: First, cadres are better integrated with the armed forces, and the majority of militiamen and activists in each village have been integrated with cadres to form guerrilla teams. However, not enough attention has been paid to conducting in-depth war mobilization of the masses, integrating the broad masses, and launching mass guerrilla warfare. Second, due to insufficient mobilization, the masses still have some muddled ideas ideologically, such as not having fundamentally recognized the Chiang Kai-shek army, which has weakened their determination to fight resolutely. In some villages, because of the concentration of militiamen and cadres, bad elements take the opportunity to spread rumors, causing panic among the masses. The Prefectural Committee believes that if these problems cannot be solved well, the policy of "the district not leaving the district" will not be implemented. If the district guerrilla team cannot be integrated with the masses, there is a danger of being driven out by the enemy. Therefore, the above decision was made.
　　[Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 13th Dispatch] The local armed forces of all military sub-districts are enthusiastically responding to the merit campaign. The Political Department of the Fourth Military Sub-district called on troops to strengthen the relationship between superiors and subordinates, do a good job in loving the people, and enthusiastically launch the "Three-Three" movement. That is, "Three Goods," "Three Quicks," and "Three No-Goes." "Three Goods" means: First, superiors and subordinates should be friendly and good; second, the spirit of labor should be good; and third, the relationship between the military and the people should be good. "Three Quicks" means being quick in carrying water, sweeping the floor, and drawing water with a well rope when helping the masses. "Three No-Goes" means not leaving before the water tank is full before marching, not leaving before the floor is swept clean, and not leaving before the borrowing procedures are cleared. Now "Three Quicks" and "Three No-Goes" have become a mass movement. The merit campaign in the rear echelon headquarters of the Fourth Military Sub-district has also entered a new stage, breaking the phenomenon of empty talk about merit and integrating it with work. Everyone has set a merit plan and a draft merit proposal. The outstanding performance of the merit campaign in the Sixth Military Sub-district is reflected in combat. During the battle to annihilate the puppet army of Li Lianxiang, a certain regiment conquered Chen Temple stronghold, surrounded by four moats, two rows of deer antlers, and nine rows of barbed wire, in forty minutes at the cost of one wounded person. The Eighth Military Sub-district convened a merit-making conference for troops directly under its command. Deputy Political Commissar Zhang put forward specific conditions for making merit and pointed out the erroneous idea that there is no way to make merit in the work of the agency. Now the work in all departments is extremely tense.

　　冀鲁豫七地委指示各县
    加强群众性游击战争
    各分区部队开展立功运动
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】冀鲁豫七地委为克服备战检查中所发现的一些缺点，指示各县加强依靠群众的观点，加强村级动员，开展群众性的游击战争。七地委在备战调查中发觉某些村区在游击战争的开展与提高上存在着两个问题：第一、干部结合武装较好，各村大多数民兵与积极分子已与干部结合，编成游击队。但没有足够注意对群众进行深入的战争动员，结合广大群众，开展群众性的游击战争。第二、因动员的不够，群众在思想上还存在着一些糊涂问题，如还没有从本质上认识蒋军而减弱了坚决斗争的决心。有些村因集中民兵和干部，坏分子乘机造谣，引起群众恐慌。地委会认为这些问题如不能很好解决，“区不离区”的方针将无法贯彻。区游击队如不能与群众结合，就有被敌人撵出去的危险。因此作出上述决定。
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】各分区地方武装热烈响应立功运动。四分区政治部号召部队密切上下级关系，作好爱民工作，热烈开展“三三”运动。即“三好”“三快”与“三不走”。“三好”，一要上下级友爱好，二要劳动精神好，三要军民关系好。“三快”是在帮助群众工作挑水快，扫地快，井绳打水快。“三不走”是行军前水缸不满不走，地不扫净不走，借物手续未清不走。现“三快”“三不走”已成为群众性运动。四分区后梯队司令部立功运动亦已走上新阶段，打破了立功空谈现象，与工作结合起来，每人订了立功计划与立功草案。六分区立功突出地表现在作战中，某团在歼伪军李连祥战役时，以四十分钟时间和负伤一人的代价攻克了四道围壕，两道鹿砦，及九道铁丝网环绕的陈寺据点。八分区召开了直属队军人立功大会，由张副政委提出立功具体条件，并指出机关工作没法立功的错误思想。现各部门工作都异常紧张。
