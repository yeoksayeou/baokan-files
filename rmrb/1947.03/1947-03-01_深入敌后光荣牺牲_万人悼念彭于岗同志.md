　　Glorious Sacrifice Deep Behind Enemy Lines
　　Tens of Thousands Mourn Comrade Peng Yugang
　　[This newspaper reports from Taihang on the 25th] Comrade Peng Yugang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Huixian County, encountered the enemy at Wulihe, five miles from the city, on January 26th while developing guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. He unfortunately sacrificed his life. When the sad news spread, the masses of the county were filled with grief and indignation. On the 12th of this month, over ten thousand people in Panshang (referring to the mountainous area of Huixian County) spontaneously gathered at Xipingluo to hold a memorial service. On that day, the cold wind was biting, and the masses came from all directions with sacrificial offerings in their hands and white flowers on their chests. The masses behind enemy lines also disregarded the heavy blockade of Chiang Kai-shek's and the puppet regime and came from afar to mourn the hero they loved. Comrade Peng was from Zuoquan Matian, and came from a poor family. He was 26 years old and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1938 (at the age of 17). During the struggles of rent reduction and debt liquidation in 1942 and the cracking of the major case of Kuomintang secret agents who assassinated Deputy Commander Peng in Matian in 1943, Comrade Peng took the lead among the masses and actively led the struggle, which was loved by the masses of Matian. He was transferred to Huixian County Public Security Bureau as section chief last February. Since Chiang Kai-shek's and the puppet regime's breach of contract and large-scale attack on the people of Huixian County, Comrade Peng has led public security team members to raid areas near the city gates, crack down on profiteers and local bullies, and capture Chiang Kai-shek's and the puppet regime's plainclothes agents. The sacrifice of Comrade Peng is a loss to the Chinese people.

　　深入敌后光荣牺牲
    万人悼念彭于岗同志
    【本报太行二十五日电】辉县公安股长彭于岗同志，一月二十六日于敌后开展游击战争中，与敌遭遇于距城五里之五里河，不幸牺牲，噩讯传出，该县群众莫不悲愤。本月十二日，盘上（指辉县山地）万余群众自动集会西平罗追悼。是日寒风刺骨，群众手捧祭品，胸佩白花，由四处赶来，敌后群众亦不顾蒋伪之重重封锁，远道赶来悼念他们所爱戴的英雄。彭同志左权麻田人，家境贫寒，现年二十六岁，三八年（十七岁）参加中国共产党。在四二年减租清债，四三年麻田破获暗杀彭副总司令国特巨案等斗争中，彭同志即身先群众，积极领导，为麻田群众所热爱。去年二月调辉县公安局任股长。自蒋伪违约大举向辉县人民进攻后，彭同志即带领公安队员，直捣城关附近，打击倒爷奸霸，捕捉蒋伪便衣。彭同志之牺牲实为中国人民之损失。
