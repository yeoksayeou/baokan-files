    Changzhi County Committee Summarizes Land Reform Experience
    [Our Newspaper] The land reform and emancipation check-up movement that began in Changzhi County in early December of last year, after a fierce great land investigation movement and in-depth movement, lasted for four months. According to statistics from 175 administrative villages in the county, farmers recovered a total of 72,963.6 mu of land (87,953.9 mu recovered during the rent and interest reduction movement), more than 20,000 rooms, more than 800 livestock, nearly 60,000 shi of grain, and many other materials and utensils. Under the slogan of "What's lacking is what's divided to fill the gaps," through mass self-reporting, group discussions, mutual comparison, evaluation committee reviews, and mass approval, the gaps were filled, and the deficiencies were made up. More than 6,000 extremely poor people in the county received an average of 2.5 mu of land per person; more than 1,500 farm laborers received an average of 4.8 mu of land per person; more than 58,000 poor farmers received an average of 1.5 mu of land per person. 203 demobilized soldiers received an average of 4.7 mu of land per person. More than 90,000 middle peasants received an average of 0.27 mu of land per person. All the extremely poor, farm laborers, and poor peasants were elevated in status. The County Committee summarized the main points of the land reform experience as follows:

  Clearly Define the Policy of Mobilizing All Poor and Farm Laborers and Thoroughly Eliminate Feudalism
    1. Mobilizing poor and farm laborers, with them as the main force, and uniting with middle peasants is the most basic class line and method for completing land reform. The understanding and clarification of this policy went through many twists and turns. In the rent and interest reduction struggle stage, due to unclear leadership ideology, the beginning emphasized boldness and letting go, believing in the masses to support and make decisions, but it was not clear to whom to let go, who to believe, and who to support. In some villages, the movement naturally formed a backbone of poor and farm laborers, and the results were relatively good, while in some villages, the movement initially grabbed a part of the middle peasants or hooligans who dared to speak and fight, without making the poor and farm laborers the backbone, and the movement remained sluggish and chaotic. Taoyuan in the first district is a typical example of this. At the beginning of the land reform movement, the County Committee made a clearer decision to "face honest peasants" and "mobilize poor and farm laborers." In the implementation, 100% of the poor and farm laborers were emancipated, and 90% were mobilized. In Nantianhe, 73 out of 74 poor and farm laborers became activists. In each district and village, after several specific calculations and specific division of labor by cadres, the poor and farm laborers were mobilized, so the movement was large-scale and thorough. In the rent and interest reduction stage, whoever had a problem got the fruit, so that some extremely poor households, who were so poor that they did not even have a problem, did not get the fruit and were not emancipated. The fruits of the struggle were sold, and speculative middle peasants benefited a lot. Although the slogan "Farmers all over the world are one family" was also put forward, it only meant not advocating struggle against middle peasants, but allowing them to solve problems, resulting in middle peasants taking out a lot of property, damaging the interests of some middle peasants, and the goal of uniting middle peasants was still not achieved. In the land reform stage, the main emphasis was on eliminating landlords, not fighting the rich. Moreover, it was clarified that middle peasants should not only not be struggled against, but should also be given a share of the fruits. Therefore, most of the middle peasants were united, most of them participated in the peasant associations, and all of them got a share of the fruits. Therefore, mobilizing the masses must start with the poor and farm laborers, give them great power, support them to make decisions, mobilize them to unite with the middle peasants to form a broad peasant action, and boldly let them struggle against the landlords and eliminate feudalism, which is a complete class line. All villages where the struggle was chaotic, the landlords took advantage of loopholes, and the movement did not go well were because they violated this policy.

  Combine with Action and Pay Attention to Ideological Emancipation
    2. Start with ideological mobilization and conduct ideological education to achieve ideological emancipation of peasants. The standard for peasants' thorough emancipation is not only economic emancipation, but also ideological emancipation. If the ideology is not awakened and not emancipated, it will form a phenomenon of open struggle but secret non-struggle, fake struggle, sheltering landlords, pitying landlords, and landlords collapsing in name but not in reality. The ideological emancipation of peasants runs through the entire movement. At the beginning, it must start with complaining about suffering and finding the root of poverty, so that peasants can recall the essence of landlord exploitation, hate the landlords, and act on the class intuition of hating the landlord class to launch a struggle. For example, the movement in Beitianhe initially launched a three-day, three-night movement of complaining about suffering and finding the root of poverty. Every peasant held family meetings, group meetings to complain, and collective complaining by all the peasants. In the process of complaining about suffering and finding the root of poverty, the peasants unanimously hated the five major landlords in the village, including Zhao Kailao, and plunged into the struggle on the fourth day. All villages in the county were mobilized in the process of complaining about suffering and finding the root of poverty. However, after the peasants acted, they would have new ideological concerns, hindering the deepening of the movement. Therefore, it is necessary to educate in action, struggle and educate at the same time. For example, Yangbao Village shattered the landlords' seven bribery attempts in the entire struggle and carried out ideological education, so the movement deepened. Houbeizhuang, after the struggle broke out, the landlord Li Linzhi threatened the masses with change of dynasty, hindering the movement. Then, a struggle to settle the accounts of the change of dynasty was carried out, and finally the landlord was overthrown. Quzhai Village, in the process of distributing the fruits, discussed at the same time that the fruits were the blood and sweat of the peasants, improved class consciousness, resolved the disputes in the distribution of fruits, and realized that they should be suitable for themselves, compare with others, and be convenient for others and themselves. Complaining about suffering and finding the root of poverty in action, combined with ideological education, can only be individual, partial, and unsystematic. When the movement is deepening, it is also necessary to focus on ideological education and launch a comprehensive and systematic movement of ideological emancipation of peasants. The county launched a comprehensive ideological emancipation movement in mid-February, using methods such as breaking through typical examples, group discussions, and general debates to finally systematically solve the issues of: Should we struggle? Who is the master of the land? Whose are the fruits of the struggle? And thoughts such as conscience, fate, and superstition. The peasants consciously stepped forward to put down their burdens, tell their thoughts, withdraw from Taoist gates, investigate landlords, and finally separate from the landlords.

  Continuous Struggle, Repeated Investigation, Multiple Exposing Landlord Conspiracies
    3. Boldly let go, trust the masses, and repeatedly investigate the landlords to thoroughly eliminate feudalism. The feudal rule of the landlords was eliminated through multiple, repeated, and continuous struggles. However, from the leadership to the broad masses, due to naivety and insufficient understanding of the essence of the landlord class, they became complacent after each struggle and developed a "good enough" mentality. This was the case after rent reduction, after the great land investigation movement, and only after ten or eight investigations of the landlords in the in-depth movement did they gradually realize the essence of the landlord class. Experience has proved that due to the conspiracies and tricks of the landlord class to escape the struggle and preserve themselves, the awareness of cadres and peasants will not be improved at once. Therefore, eliminating landlords is a multiple, repeated, ten or eight struggles. The largest landlord in Zhonghe Village, Master He, was struggled against at the beginning of the movement, and he was still struggled against at the end of the movement, more than ten times. Cao Fuxiang, the target of struggle in Nantianhe, hid his property in more than 120 places. The leadership must educate cadres at any time to recognize the cunning conspiracy of the landlord class and form a continuous, multiple investigation struggle. In the repeated investigation of landlords, it is necessary to enlighten peasants to consciously put down their burdens, dig "air-raid shelters," and separate from the landlords. In the in-depth movement, a considerable number of peasants were generally found to have taken on the landlords' burdens and preserved their property. In Yuangajun Tianxinyuan, one landlord family had 25 peasant households preserving their property for them. In Beizhai, there were 80 households that could not break away from the landlords. This is worthy of everyone's attention.

  How to Massively Use Activists
    4. Massively use activists, cultivate a leadership group with poor and farm laborers as the backbone, and summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner. At the beginning of the movement, in addition to the County Committee directly convening expanded cadre meetings and Party member training classes, each district convened mobilization meetings of village cadres and activists of about 500 people. During the distribution of fruits at the end of the great inspection, during the in-depth movement, and during armed consciousness, each district successively convened general meetings. More than six meetings of activists and village cadres were held in each movement, and each base point (an average of six base points per district) held meetings in a timely manner to exchange experiences and conduct inspections. Experience has proved that large-scale mass movements must be led by massively using activists, developing rapidly, and implementing rapidly, so that the leadership can also summarize the creations of the masses in a timely manner. Attention should be paid to increasing the composition of new activists in each stage of the movement, and not fixing it.

    The village-level leadership in the movement must be a leadership group composed of poor and farm laborers as the backbone. In addition to the village-level responsible cadres, this leadership group should include a group of poor and farm laborer activists. Each meeting at the district level was attended by village-level cadres and lower-level poor and farm laborer activists. Therefore, they naturally formed a leadership group after returning to the village. When district-level cadres came to the village, they also mobilized and discussed village cadres and activists together, thus gradually cultivating this leadership group, so that village-level cadres and the masses could truly combine, and district-level cadre leadership could also truly penetrate into the masses. For example, Nantianhe, with the emancipated hero Cao Linshui as the backbone, united ten main cadres in the village, eleven peasant association group leaders, and more than twenty active militiamen and activists, forming a leadership group of more than forty people in the village. With such a leadership group, the mass line can be implemented. The key to the County Committee's leadership lies in timeliness, because new problems arise quickly in the development of the movement. The County Committee must personally understand the situation at the lower level at all times, concentrate the opinions and creations of the masses, and disseminate them to the broad activist layer and spread them to the broad masses through the County Committee liaison meetings, district-level main cadre meetings, district cadre meetings, district liaison meetings, and base point meetings.

    长治县委会总结土地改革经验
    【本报讯】长治县从去年十二月初开始的土地改革翻身大检查运动，经过了猛烈的大查田运动，及深入运动，历时四个月。据全县一百七十五个行政村的统计，农民共收回土地七万二千九百六十三亩六分（减租减息运动中收回的八万七千九百五十三亩九分），房屋二万余间，牲口八百余头，粮食将近六万石，及其他物资用具等甚多。这些果实在“缺什分什填圪道”的口号下，经过群众自报小组讨论，互相比较，评议会评议，群众批准，填平补齐，全县赤贫六各余人，平均每人得到土地二亩五分，雇农一千五百余人，平均每人得地四亩八分，贫农五万八千余人，平均每人得地一亩五分。荣退军人二百零三人，平均每人得到土地四亩七分。中农九万余人，平均每人得到土地二分七厘。赤贫、雇、贫农全部上升。县委总结土地改革经验主要有以下几点：
  明确发动全部贫雇方针放手彻底消灭封建
    一、发动贫雇，以贫雇作主力，团结中农，是完成土地改革最基本的阶级路线与方法。这条方针的领会与明确，是经过了许多曲折道路的。在减租减息斗争阶段，由于领导思想不大明确，在开始即强调了大胆放手，相信群众撑腰作主，对放给谁？相信谁？给谁撑腰？不明确。有些村庄运动自然形成贫雇骨干结果就比较好，而有些村庄一开始抓住了一部敢说敢斗的中农或流氓没有使贫雇成为骨干，运动就一直消沉、乱斗。一区桃园就是这种典型。土地改革运动一开始，县委就较明确的作出了“面向老实农民”“发动贫雇”的决定，执行中贫雇农百分之百的翻了身，百分之九十被发动了起来，南天河七十四个贫雇中，七十三个成为积极分子，各区村都是经过了几次的具体计算，干部具体分工，发动贫雇，因之运动规模宏大也彻底。减租减息阶段是谁有问题谁得果实，使一些赤贫户贫的连问题也没有者，没得到果实，没有翻了身，斗争果实采取出卖办法，投机中农得利不少。虽然也提出了“天下农民是一家”的口号，仅只是不主张斗中农，但允许解圪塔，结果中农拿出不少的财物，损害了部分中农利益，团结中农的目的仍未达到。在土地改革阶段，主要强调了消灭地主，不是斗富。而且明确了中农不仅不应该被斗，而且应当分到果实，因之大部中农被团结了起来，大部参加了农会，全部得到了果实。因之，发动群众必须从贫雇农入手，给他们大权，给他们撑腰作主，发动起他们去团结中农形成广大农民行动，大胆放手的交他们去斗争地主，消灭封建是完整的阶级路线。凡是斗争混乱，地主钻空，运动搞不好的村庄都是因为违犯了这条方针而来的。
  与行动结合注意思想翻身
    二、从思想发动入手进行思想教育达到农民思想翻身。农民彻底翻身的标准，不仅是经济上翻身，必须思想上一样翻身，思想不觉悟不翻身，会形成明斗暗不斗，假斗争，包庇地主，可怜地主，地主明垮暗不垮等现象。农民思想翻身是贯串整个运动过程的，开始必须是从诉痛苦找穷根入手，使农民回忆地主剥削本质，使农民仇恨起地主，在仇恨地主阶级的阶级直感上行动起来，发动斗争。如北天河一开始运动是发动了三天三夜诉痛苦找穷根运动，每个农民都开家庭会小组诉苦会，及农民全体的集体诉苦，在诉苦找穷根中，农民一致的仇恨了全村赵开老等五户大地主，第四天就卷入了斗争。全县各村都是在诉苦找穷根中行动起来的。但当农民行动起来之后，又会在思想上产生新的顾虑，阻碍着运动的深入。因之必须在行动中教育，一边斗争，一边教育。如杨暴村即在整个斗争中粉碎了地主七次收买，进行了思想教育，运动才深入下去，堠北庄在斗争起来后，地主李林芝用变天威胁群众，阻碍了运动，即进行算变天账的斗争，最后斗垮地主，璩寨村在分配果实中一边分果实，一边讨论了果实是农民血汗，提高了阶级觉悟，解决了农民分果实中的纠纷，认识了自己要合适，比比别人行不行，与人方便自己方便。诉苦找穷根行动中，结合思想教育，只能是个别的部分的不系统。在运动走向深入时，还必须以思想教育为主，发动一个全面的、系统的农民思想翻身大运动。全县于二月中旬全面的发动了思想大翻身运动；用突破典型、小组讨论、大会辩论等方式最后的系统的解决了：斗争该不该？谁是土地的主人翁？斗争果实是谁的？及良心命运迷信等思想。农民自觉的起来放包袱，说心思话，退道门，查地主，最后与地主分家。
  持续斗争反复清查多方揭露地主阴谋
    三、大胆放手，相信群众，反复再反复的清查地主，彻底消灭封建。地主的封建统治被消灭是多次的，反复的持续的斗争。可是从领导上到广大群众，由于幼稚，对地主阶级本质认识不够，因之每次斗争之后，就自满起来，产生差不多思想。在减租后如此，在大查田运动后如此，到深入运动十次八次的清查地主时，才逐渐的认识了地主的阶级的本质。经验证明由于地主阶级的阴谋诡计，逃避斗争，保存自己，干部农民的觉悟不会一下提高，因之消灭地主就是一个多次的反复的十次八次的斗争。中和村最大的地主和老爷一开始运动就斗他，一直到运动最后还斗他，斗争十余次以上，南天河斗争对象曹福祥，财产隐藏了一百廿余个地方，领导上必须随时教育干部，认识地主阶级狡猾阴谋，形成一个持续的多次的清查斗争。在反复的清查地主中必须随时启发农民自觉，放包袱，挖“防空洞”与地主分家，在深入运动中，全县普遍的发现相当数量的农民背上了地主的包袱，给地主保存了财产，原家庄天心院一户地主，就有二十五户农民给他保存财产。北寨有八十户和地主割不断关系，这是值得大家注意的。
  如何大量运用积极分子
    四、大量的运用积极分子，培养以贫雇为骨干的领导集团，及时总结交流经验。运动开始发动，除县委直接召开扩大干部会议及党员训练班外，每区都召开了五百人左右的村干部与积极分子动员会议。在大检查告一段落分配果实时、深入运动时，武装自觉时，各区都接连的召开了大会，每次运动中都开过了六次以上积极分子村干部会议，每个基点（每区平均六个基点）又及时的召开了会议，交流经验，进行检查，经验证明；大规模的群众运动，必须是领导上大量的运用积极分子，迅速开展，迅速的贯彻，领导上也才能及时总结群众的创造。每段运动都须注意增加新积极分子的成份，不要固定起来。
    运动中村级的领导，必须是组成贫雇为骨干的领导集团，这个领导集团除包括村级负责干部外，应包括一批贫雇积极分子。区上的每次会议都是由村级干部与贫雇下层积极分子参加的，因之他们回村后自然的形成了一个领导集团，区级干部到村后，也一样把村干部与积极分子在一块动员讨论，这样逐渐培养这个领导集团，使村级干部与群众真心结合起来，区级干部领导也可真正深入到群众中去。如南天河以翻身英雄曹林水为骨干，团结了全村十个主要干部，十一个农会小组长，及二十余积极民兵与积极分子，形成了全村四十余人的领导集团。有了这样的领导集团，才能贯彻群众路线。县委的领导主要关键在于及时，因为运动发展中，新问题的产生是很快的，县委要亲自动手，时时了解下层情况，集中群众意见与创造，并用县委接头会，区级主要干部会议，区干部会，区接头会，基点会等方式贯彻到广大积极分子层中，散播到广大群众中去。
