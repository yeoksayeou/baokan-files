Women Cadres in the Border Region Send a Telegram to Commanders Liu and Deng to Express Sympathy to All Commanders and Fighters at the Front

[Reported by this newspaper] The Women Cadres and Family Members of the direct subordinate organs of the Jinji Luyu Border Region held an expanded symposium on "March 8th" International Women's Day and issued a letter to all women in the region. The original text is as follows:

    Last year today, the ceasefire order, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the peaceful nation-building program of "guaranteeing women's equal status in politics and economics" brought us infinitely bright hopes. This hope was soon shattered by Chiang Kai-shek, who colluded with US imperialism to implement treason, dictatorship, and civil war. Chiang Kai-shek concentrated dozens of brigades to launch a large-scale offensive against our Jinji Luyu Border Region. Wherever the flames of war reached, our women sisters suffered particularly deep pain and disaster.

    But we women sisters are by no means slaves to be slaughtered. In the past year, our women sisters in the border region have heroically participated in the patriotic self-defense war and exerted great strength in all aspects. We participated in the war by comforting the troops, undertaking various war support tasks, actively participating in the emancipation movement, replacing men in completing rear production tasks, and encouraging our husbands and sons to bravely kill the enemy... We have made significant contributions in war, emancipation, and production.

    This year's "March 8th" International Women's Day is when the national patriotic self-defense war is about to turn into a full-scale counter-offensive, and Chiang Kai-shek is in deep crisis, determined to gamble everything, completely break down, and launch an attack on Yan'an. Our women sisters must urgently mobilize, strengthen unity, work hard in production, work hard, participate more actively in the emancipation movement, and more heroically support the front line, and struggle for the early realization of the independence, peace and democracy of the Chinese nation!

[Reported by this newspaper] The Women Cadres and Family Members of the direct subordinate organs of the Jinji Luyu Border Region held an expanded symposium on "March 8th" International Women's Day and sent a telegram to Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng to express sympathy to all commanders and fighters at the front. The original telegram is as follows:

    For the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation, and to defend the democratic, free and happy life of the Jinji Luyu Liberated Area, you have fought heroically with Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of US imperialism, and wiped out nearly 20 enemy brigades, gradually gaining the initiative in the war and laying the foundation for a full-scale counter-offensive. All the women cadres and family members of our general directly subordinate team extend our sincere condolences to you, and at the "March 8th" International Women's Day symposium, we initiated a campaign to comfort the troops with one item per person to express our respect and enthusiasm. We are determined to respond to the call of the Party, work hard, produce and save, support the front, and fight for the early defeat of Chiang Kai-shek. We send this telegram to express our condolences and wish you victory and health!

　　边区女干部电刘邓首长
    慰问前方全体指战员
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁边区直属机关女干部及家属“三八”节扩大座谈会发表告全区妇女书，原文如下：
    去年今天，停战令、政协决议与“保证妇女在政治上经济上之平等地位”的和平建国纲领给我们带来了无限光明的希望。这个希望不久即被勾结美帝国主义，实行卖国、独裁、内战的蒋介石打破了。蒋介石集中几十个旅向我晋冀鲁豫边区大举进攻，战火所至，我们妇女姐妹们遭受了特别深重的痛苦与灾难。
    但我们妇女姐妹决非任人宰杀的奴隶，一年来，我们边区的妇女姐妹英勇的参加了爱国自卫战争，在各方面发挥了伟大的力量。我们参战劳军，担负各种战勤工作，踊跃参加翻身运动，代替男子完成后方的生产任务，鼓励自己的丈夫儿子英勇杀敌……，我们在战争、翻身、生产中作了重大的贡献。
    今年的“三八”节正是全国爱国自卫战争即将转入全面反攻，而蒋介石危机深重，决心孤注一掷，全面破裂，发动进攻延安的时候，我们妇女姐妹们要紧急动员起来，加强团结，努力生产，努力工作，更踊跃的参加翻身运动，更英勇的支援前线，为早日实现中华民族的独立和平民主而奋斗！
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区直属机关女干部及家属“三八”节扩大座谈会致电刘司令员、邓政委慰问前方全体指战员同志，原电如下：
    你们为了中华民族的独立解放，为了保卫晋冀鲁豫解放区民主、自由、幸福的生活，与美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石英勇奋战，消灭敌人近二十个旅，逐渐取得了战争的主动权，奠定了全面反攻的基础。我们总直属队全体女干部及家属特向你们致亲切的慰问，并在“三八”妇女节座谈会上发起每人一件东西的劳军运动、以表我们的敬意和热忱。我们决心响应党的号召，努力工作，生产节约，支援前线，为争取早日打败蒋介石而斗争。特电慰问，并祝胜利和健康！
