　　Yuncheng Actively Overcomes Difficulties to Complete Seven Wartime Support Missions
    General Headquarters of the JiluYu Rear Area Issues Commendation
    [This newspaper's JiluYu dispatch, 28th] The General Headquarters of the JiluYu Rear Area recently issued a circular commending counties that have successfully completed wartime support missions during the seven self-defense war campaigns. The original order pointed out: "Yuncheng has demonstrated a high degree of responsibility for serving the self-defense war in completing wartime support missions. During the seven campaigns, the county provided 1,100 stretchers, completed 140,000 jin of flour and rice, 5,000 jin of charcoal, and 70 coffins within three days, ensuring the needs of the war. Linze County, which failed to complete its mission, is hereby given a warning." It continued: "There are two types of leadership styles: one is active and responsible, overcoming difficulties, strengthening mobilization and organization work, and ensuring the completion of tasks; the other is emphasizing difficulties, resisting tasks, and engaging in perfunctory and delayed work. The former should be promoted, and the latter should be changed." Finally, it pointed out to all levels of command: "You should learn from Yuncheng's style, strictly enforce discipline, and ensure the thorough completion of every task."
    [This newspaper's Shexian dispatch] After successfully completing their missions, the stretcher bearers and civilian laborers who participated from Shexian returned. Some were injured by enemy fire while rescuing the wounded and have been sent to a hospital in a certain location in Mu County for treatment. The county party committee, county government, armed forces committee, rescue association, post office, bank, public security bureau, county cooperative, teachers' college and other units, have successively brought慰劳品 to express their sympathy. Han Fuqing, 41, said: "This little thing is nothing. Our frontline troops are not afraid of sacrifice, aren't they all for our people!"

　　郓城主动克服困难完成七次战勤任务
    冀鲁豫后方总指挥部通令表扬
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】冀鲁豫后方总指挥部顷通令表扬自卫战争七次战役中完成战勤任务之有功县份，原令指出：“郓城在完成战勤任务上，表现了高度为自卫战争服务的负责精神。该县七次战役中共出担架一千一百付，三天完成面米十四万斤、木炭五千斤、棺木七十具。保证了战争的需要。并对未完成任务之临泽县于以警告处分。”继称：“一种是积极负责，克服困难，加强动员组织工作，保证完成任务的领导作风，一种是强调困难，拒抗任务，敷衍迟缓的工作作风，应发扬前者、改变后者。”最后指出各级指挥部：“应学习郓城的作风，严整纪律，保证每一任务的彻底完成。”
    【本报涉县讯】涉县参加担架民夫于胜利完成任务后返回，有个别在敌人密集火力下因抢救伤员而挂彩的，已送木县某地医院疗养。县委机关、县府、武委会、救联会、邮局、银行、公安局、县联社、师范等单位，纷纷携带慰劳品前往慰劳。四十一岁的韩福清说：“这点小事算个啥，咱前线军队不怕牺牲，还不都是为咱们老百姓！”
