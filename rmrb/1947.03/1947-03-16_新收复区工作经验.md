Work Experience in Newly Recovered Areas
    Taihang Branch

    Since last winter and this spring, our army has launched continuous offensives against the enemy in Tangyin, liberating more than sixty villages and towns such as Loulou, Zhao Family Factory, Deng Family, and Lou Family Village. We have gained preliminary experience in carrying out work in the newly recovered areas.
    (1) Repeatedly disseminate the news of our army's victories, especially in the local area, to explain the nature, tactics, and future of the war, to stabilize the people's emotions, overcome the people's confusion about the war, and increase confidence, so that the people recognize that the war is to protect their own liberation interests. On the other hand, because the peasants have not seen American soldiers holding guns and killing ordinary people, and still have the orthodox idea of Chiang Kai-shek as the "central government," their understanding of the patriotic nature of the war is very insufficient, and more efforts should be made to publicize it in this regard.
    (2) Extensively and deeply publicize our policy of eliminating traitors in various ways. For ordinary masses, cadres, militiamen, and all elements who have been deceived, coerced, or forced to join the enemy in fleeing to the Chiang Kai-shek puppet areas, as long as they come back and realize that they have taken the wrong path, they should be treated with leniency, and their lives and property should be protected; if they can bring back the guns they took, the government will reward them. If they cannot bring them back, they can also repent to the government and make new contributions. Explain that what we want to eradicate are the landlords and bullies who collude with Chiang Kai-shek and the puppets to harm the people, and send the slogan "Peasants are always one family, confession and repentance are nothing" to their hearts. Explain that "there is no good life for us on the east side (Chiang-controlled area)," and relying on relatives and friends is not a long-term solution. Only by returning to our home where we have a house to live in, land to cultivate, food to eat, and a voice to speak, can we have "our time."
    In carrying out this work, we must let cadres and activists with prestige among the masses send letters and messages to them, let their relatives, friends, old women, women, and children in the village communicate with those who are striving to return, and use various methods to publicize policies and strive for their return.
    (3) Restore various organizations, and everything should be subordinate to the struggle against the enemy. First of all, we must organize the cadres and activists who remain in the village into the village headquarters, restore the self-defense team sentry posts and social order, and lead the masses to carry out the emptying of houses and fields to prevent the enemy from coming again to loot grain. Organize mass transfer groups and joint security groups, which can be merged and organized under the principle of voluntary combination of the masses, and formulate covenants, establish front and rear headquarters, and other organizations should carry out work uniformly in the headquarters.
    (4) After the masses have suffered the enemy's looting, rape, retaliation, and reversals of accounts, they are full of grief. We should organize the masses to make such accusations, so that the masses can recognize the brutal faces of Little Chiang and Big Chiang, further enlighten the masses' awareness and fighting will, and shout the slogan "Get back what was taken and settle the accounts, and live a good life from now on" to encourage the masses. Publicize the government's laws and decrees on the protection of the property and land rights of the liberated masses to support the masses' actions, so that the liberated interests of the masses who have suffered losses can be restored.

　　新收复区工作经验
    太行分社
    去冬今春我军连续对汤阴敌发动攻势，解放了鹿楼、赵家厂、邓家、娄家庄等村镇六十多个，在进行新收复区工作中，已获初步经验。
    （一）反复的传播我军胜利消息，尤其是本地面的，说明战争的性质、打法与前途，来稳定群众情绪，克服群众对战争认识上的糊涂，提高信心，使群众认识战争是保卫自己翻身利益的。另一方面由于农民没有见到美国兵拿着枪杆杀老百姓，以及对蒋介石还存在着“中央政府”的正统思想，所以对战争是爱国性质的了解就非常不够，在这方面还要大力宣传。
    （二）广泛深入的利用各种方式宣传我之锄奸政策，对逃往蒋伪区的一般群众干部民兵与一切上当胁从及被迫投敌的分子，只要其回来认识自己是走错了路，都要宽大处理，保障其生命与财产；带去的枪能背回时政府有奖，不能背回时，也可向政府悔过自新，重新立功劳。说明我们所要铲除的是罪大恶极的勾结蒋伪苦害人民的地主恶霸，把“农民总是一家人，坦白悔过没事情”的口号，送到他们的心坎里。说明“到东面（蒋管区）没有咱的时光过”，投亲戚靠朋友总不是长久事，只有回到咱有房住、有地种、有饭吃、有话说的家，才有“咱的时光”。
    进行这件工作，要让在群众中有威信的干部积极分子给他们捎信传话，让他们的亲戚朋友和村里的老太婆、女人、小孩与争取回来的人去串通，运用各种方法去宣传政策、串通争取。
    （三）恢复各种组织，一切服从于对敌斗争。我们首先要把留村的干部与积极分子组织到村指挥部里，恢复自卫队岗哨与社会秩序，领导群众进行空舍清野，防备敌人再来抢粮。组织群众转移组与联环保小组，在群众自愿结合原则下，可以合并组织，并订出公约，设立前后方指挥部，其他各种组织到指挥部里统一进行工作。
    （四）群众尝受了敌人的抢劫、奸淫、报复、倒算等蹂躏后，有着满腹悲酸，我们应当组织群众的这种控诉，使群众认清小蒋大蒋的残暴面孔，进一步启发群众的觉悟与斗争意志，喊出“要回东西算清账，从此再过好时光”的口号，去鼓励群众。宣传政府对翻身群众财、地权的保障法令，去支持群众的行动，使群众受到损失的翻身利益得到恢复。
