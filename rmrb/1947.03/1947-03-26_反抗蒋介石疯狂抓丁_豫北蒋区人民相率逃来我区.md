    Resisting Chiang Kai-shek's Mad Conscription
    People in the Chiang-Controlled Areas of Northern Henan Flee to Our Areas
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 24th dispatch] To replenish his invading army that had been shattered to pieces, Chiang Kai-shek has been frantically conscripting soldiers in various places since January. The conscription quota for the Henan controlled area in January was 300,000, and 71,000 people had already been conscripted by the end of January. The pro-Chiang Henan Provincial Assembly also telegraphed Chen Cheng, requesting him to cancel the unfulfilled number. Chen Cheng not only refused but also said that he would make up for the "conscription quota" of the 36th year of the Republic. To supplement this "conscription quota," the Chiang government promulgated the "Regulations for Punishing Crimes Against Military Service," and the Ministry of Education decided that starting in February, all free-of-charge students from high schools and normal colleges who had fled their homes would be cancelled, in an attempt to force them to become cannon fodder for the civil war. The student community in Henan was in an uproar and is brewing a movement to "go to the Liberated Areas!" Before the first mission was completed, the second conscription order was issued, with a quota of 120,000 for the Henan Garrison District, with a deadline for completion. The conscription quota for Huixian County was 2,000, and Guan Chaoyan, the county magistrate and Chiang's dog, has issued an order that each bao (a unit of 100 households) must provide 60 conscripts. He also formed armed conscription teams to specialize in catching people, and villages such as Baogongmiao, Qianhoufancheng, Zhaotun, and Zhaogu have been surrounded and searched several times. Yang Tianchang of Maqiao committed suicide because his son was conscripted. The landlord Jia Jintan's family had two conscripts assigned to them. Some young people in the county blinded themselves or took poison to create illnesses. During the day, no young adults can be seen in the villages. When the conscription team went to Dalangzhong Village to conscript soldiers, the village was already empty before they even got close. The conscripts who were taken from Xinkuaicun Camp also ran back one after another. At present, the number of people fleeing to the Liberated Areas is increasing day by day. Zhou Jiasuo, an old couple from Chenzhuang, Xinxiang, a mother and her three children from Fanling Village, and Jia Er, a strong young man, have successively fled to the Liberated Areas and have been given relief by the democratic government to help them settle down and make a living.

    反抗蒋介石疯狂抓丁
    豫北蒋区人民相率逃来我区
    【本报太行二十四日电】蒋介石为补充其被打得稀烂的进犯军，一月份以来又在各地疯狂抓丁。河南管区一月份抓丁额为卅万名，一月底即抓到七万一千人。御用的河南省参议会也电请陈诚取消未完成数，陈诚不仅未允，反说还要补征三十六年度的“征兵额”。为补充这一“征兵额”，蒋政府颁布“防害兵役治罪条例”，教育部并决定自二月份起，高中、高师以上之流亡免费生，一律取消，想逼他们当内战炮灰，河南学生界舆论大哗，正酝酿着：“到解放区去！”第一期任务未完，二期抓丁令又下，河南师管区为十二万名，并限期完成。辉县抓丁额二千名，该县蒋家狗县长关朝彦已发布每保要六十名壮丁的命令。并组武装抓丁队专事捕抓，包公庙、前后凡城、赵屯、赵固等村已被围抓数次。马桥杨天昌因儿子被抓，自杀而死。大地主贾锦坛家有被派壮丁两名。该县青年有的将眼弄瞎，有的服毒制造疾病。白天村里见不到一个青壮年。抓丁队到大粮重村抓丁，离村还很远，村里便逃空了。新块村营被抓走之壮丁，亦纷纷跑回。目前逃来解放区者与日俱增。新乡陈庄周家锁老俩口，范岭村母子三人及嘉二壮年相继逃来解放区后，均受到民主政府救济，协助其安家渡日。
