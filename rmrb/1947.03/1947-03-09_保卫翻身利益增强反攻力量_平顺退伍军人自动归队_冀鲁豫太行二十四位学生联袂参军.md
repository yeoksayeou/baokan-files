　　Defend the Interests of Emancipation, Strengthen the Counter-Offensive Force
    Retired Soldiers in Pingshun Voluntarily Rejoin
    Twenty-Four Students from the Taihang Region of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Jointly Enlist
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In order to protect the liberated areas and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, retired soldiers in Pingshun County are voluntarily rejoining the army. Last November, when Chiang Kai-shek brazenly attacked the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, eighty retired soldiers in the Second District voluntarily rejoined the army in one day. In the Third District, thirty-one people also voluntarily returned to the front line. Most of them are emancipated peasants with extremely high morale. As of now, the number of volunteers rejoining the army has reached 984. Except for 149 elderly and weak individuals who were deemed unfit for service, 835 have returned to their units. Guo Lie, a member of a revolutionary martyr's family in Wu Jing, First District, excitedly said to everyone: "Don't worry about things at home at all. The village cadres are taking care of everything. My family has a nursing infant, and the village cadres have already found a wet nurse. This time, I will not return home until the reactionaries are defeated!" Yang Fangfang from Tongzhen, Second District, said: "After defeating Chiang Kai-shek, I will return home, achieving both loyalty and filial piety!" (Wang Min)
    [Dispatch from This Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 2nd] In order to strive for an early victory in the war of self-defense, eighteen students, including Xu Qin from the Jian'guo Academy, volunteered to join the army and go to the front line. On the 19th, President Yang led all the teachers and students of the school in holding a joyous farewell meeting, and the atmosphere was extremely warm. Before leaving for the front line, Qing Hong's father also came to the farewell and instructed him: "You must do a good job in the army and wipe out the Chiang bandits for the broad masses of the people!" During the meeting, in addition to President Yang delivering a speech on behalf of all the teachers and students of the school to express his respect to the students for resolutely joining the army to overthrow the reactionaries, he also encouraged everyone to continue to study hard after leaving the school and make more contributions to the people. Finally, Xu Qin, on behalf of the eighteen students who joined the army, thanked the academy for the warm farewell and expressed that they must not forget the president's encouragement, resolutely defeat the Chiang army, and serve the people.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Zhang Yonglin, Wang Pi'ying and other six students from Taihang First Middle School voluntarily signed up for the army on the 18th of last month. At a grand farewell meeting held by all the students in the school, they expressed their determination to serve the people and strive for a victory in the counter-offensive. Zhang Yonglin said: "In the past, I suffered from the oppression and exploitation of landlords and bullies, and I could not live. My father was forced to death by the landlords, and I wandered for two years before I was emancipated under the leadership of the Communist Party and entered middle school. But Chiang Kai-shek launched a civil war and did not allow us to study in peace. Today, I want to join the army and go to the front line to defeat the reactionaries' offensive and then come back to study." Wang Pi'ying said: "In the past, I was afraid of being a soldier, so I came to school. Now I understand that only by defeating the reactionaries' offensive can we have a good life. Serving the people and going to the front line is the most glorious thing!" (Wen Ji, Jin Wen)

　　保卫翻身利益增强反攻力量
    平顺退伍军人自动归队
    冀鲁豫太行二十四位学生联袂参军
    【本报特讯】平顺县退伍军人为保全故区，打败蒋介石的进攻，纷纷自动归队。去年十一月间蒋介石悍然进攻陕甘宁边区，二区一天内即有八十个退伍军人自动归队。三区也有三十一人自动重上前线。他们大部都是翻身农民，情绪极高。截至目前为上，自动归队者已达九百八十四名，除老弱一百四十九名因体弱被动外，已有八百三十五名回到部队。一区中五井郭烈属，向大家兴奋地说：“家里的事一点也不要挂心，有村干部给照应，我家有个吃奶的小孩，村干部已经给找上奶妈，这回不打退反动派，决不回家！”二区童镇杨方方说：“打败蒋介石以后回家去，落个忠孝双全！”（王民）
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】为争取自卫战争早日胜利，建国学院徐勤等十八位同学志愿参军，开赴前线。十九日杨院长率领全校师生开欢送大会，情绪至为热烈。庆洪同学在开赴前线之前，他父亲也赴至欢送，并嘱咐他：“到部队里要好好的干，替广大人民清扫蒋贼子！”会中除杨院长致词代表全校师生对诸生毅然参军打倒反动派表示敬意，并勉励大家离校后仍要努力学习，多多为人民立功。最后由徐勤同学代表参军十八位同学对院方的热烈欢送致谢，并表示一定要不忘院长的勉励，坚决打败蒋军，为人民服务。
    【本报特讯】太行一中学生张永林、王丕英等六人，上月十八日自动报名参军，在全校同学盛大的欢送会上，他们表示出为人民服务、争取反攻胜利的决心。张永林说：“我过去受地主恶霸的压迫剥削，无法生活，父亲被地主逼死，自己流浪了二年，在共产党领导下才翻了身，入了中学。可是蒋介石发动内战，不让我们安心读书，今天我要参军上前线，打垮反动派的进攻再回来学习。”王丕英说：“过去我怕当兵才到学校来，现在我明白，只有打垮反动派进攻才能过好时光。为人民服务到前线去，是最光荣的！”（文吉、进文）
