    Adapting to the Needs of the War of Self-Defense
    Taiyue Administrative Office Establishes War Service Contingent
    Border Counties of the First and Second Special Districts Streamline Institutions and Establish Logistics Sections
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 19th dispatch] In order to strengthen war service work, the Taiyue Administrative Office decided at its political affairs meeting on the 25th of last month that, in the border counties of the First and Second Special Districts, the three sections of Culture and Education, Construction, and Justice, other than the Finance and Grain Section, would be temporarily abolished. The original work would be uniformly led by the Joint Office. The office would have one secretary-director and two to three secretaries. The Civil Affairs Section would be changed to the Logistics Section, with the number of staff increased to four, to increase the strength of war service work. The First and Second Special Districts will add five war service work teams, which will be under the unified leadership of the office for special district war service work. The Administrative Office has specially established a war service contingent, with Yang Shaoqiao, Director of the Construction Department, and Tian Jiesan, Deputy Director of the Office, serving as the contingent commander and deputy contingent commander respectively, representing the Administrative Office in participating in the work of the front-line logistics command.
