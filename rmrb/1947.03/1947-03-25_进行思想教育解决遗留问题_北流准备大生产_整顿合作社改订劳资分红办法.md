    Conduct Ideological Education to Resolve Legacy Issues
    Beiliu Prepares for Large-Scale Production
    Rectify Cooperatives and Revise Labor-Capital Profit Sharing Methods
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] Beiliu Village in Licheng is actively resolving legacy issues and preparing for spring plowing. During a meeting of cadres, heroes, and production team leaders on the 12th of this month, it was found that the masses' enthusiasm for production was not very high. After review, there were the following reasons: 1. After the mutual aid teams settled accounts last autumn, cadres and military dependents owed 1,240 catties of wage grain, and many surplus labor households did not receive their wage grain. During the emancipation movement, the masses generally developed the idea that "it's uncertain who things belong to," fearing to offend people and not actively asking for what they were owed, including 15 old middle-peasant households who felt it was safer not to ask. 2. The "fixed share, flexible work" method, designed to reward production, was not seriously implemented. For example, Liu Laohu said, "I toiled for a year and got ten shares, and Yang Gengsheng, who was naughty and lazy, also got ten shares." 3. After the emancipation movement, some individuals were not very satisfied with the distribution of fruits. 4. After the masses were allocated land, they lacked fertilizer. After review, it was decided that each team should conduct ideological education in conjunction with production preparations, thoroughly resolve the legacy issues from the mass movement and last year's production, and accurately calculate preparations for spring plowing. A short-term plan was also formulated: to pull out all the flower stalks within ten days, repair the cotton fields, and rake all the autumn land completely before mid-February in conjunction with coal transportation, and solve the problem of half a year's fuel before March. The method of accumulating fertilizer is to strive to solve it by relying on the mountains to cultivate wasteland, dig pit soil, dig ground soil, and empty latrines. Women and children are responsible for sweeping street soil and collecting dirty water in conjunction with the hygiene movement. Cadres should accurately divide labor and go deep into each mutual aid brigade to provide specific leadership. (Pi Yi, Dong Kui, Jiang He, Huan Qing)
    [Another News] Beiliu Village, a typical example of combining emancipation with production, is rectifying cooperatives, settling accounts, and distributing profits in preparation for large-scale production. After the victorious conclusion of the land reform in the village, in addition to rectifying the agricultural mutual aid textile brigade, the cooperative is actively carrying out settlement of accounts and profit distribution, and expanding its share capital. The total share capital of the village's thirteen workshops and factories is 2,507,000 yuan, and most of the 1,628,000 yuan in dividends earned in three months has been completed. In terms of expanding shares, in addition to the credit department already expanding its shares by 1,007,000 yuan, the cooperative has received more than 139,900 yuan in new shares in ten days. After this profit distribution, it was decided to change the past method of workers not earning wages, but determining the profit distribution ratio based on the amount of capital and labor. For example, the flour mill used to distribute profits based on labor at 30% and capital at 70%. Worker Li Zaoxu had not received wages for a year and owed the mutual aid team more than 70 catties of grain, so the mutual aid team was unwilling to keep him, and he was not active in working in the flour mill. After discussion, it was decided to change to 20% for labor and 80% for capital, and the workers would receive three catties of millet per day, so their enthusiasm was very high. The cotton ginning and batting factory originally distributed profits at 50% for labor and 50% for capital. Now it has been changed to 70% for labor and 30% for capital. As a result, the amount ginned by one wind bow has increased from 15 catties to 40 catties per day. New plans have also been made for improving tools. 35,000 yuan will be used to buy a water mill, which can grind one stone of grain per day with one animal and two people (a stone mill can only grind two dou), increasing production fourfold. The four animals and eight women saved will be used to transport coal and weave cloth, earning 126,000 yuan per month. At the same time, the problem of the entire village eating noodles can be completely solved. Last year, the wood factory made more than 100 spinning wheels and more than 70 hand-pulled looms, and modified more than 100 hand-pulled looms, solving the problem of textile tools for six or seven nearby villages. Now they are trying to make double-wheel spinning wheels and have decided to set up a branch factory in Fengzitu, investing 200,000 yuan, using surplus funds, improving production technology, and supporting production in this village and other villages. This is the new direction for Beiliu's future development. (@Tian, Xin Ran)

    进行思想教育解决遗留问题
    北流准备大生产
    整顿合作社改订劳资分红办法
    【本报黎城讯】黎城北流村正积极解决遗留问题，准备春耕。该村于本月十二日召开干部、英雄、生产组长会议时，发现群众生产情绪不很高。经过检讨，有以下几种原因：一、去年秋季互助组结账后，干部与军干属拖欠工资米一千二百四十斤，不少余工户没有得到工资米。翻身运动中，群众普遍产生“东西不定归谁”的思想，怕得罪人，也不主动去要，其中老中农十五户觉得不要还保险些。二、为奖励生产而订的死分活计办法没认真实行。如刘老虎说：“我扑闹了一年是十分，杨根生调皮偷懒也是十分”。三、翻身运动后，个别人对果实分配不很满意。四、群众分得土地后，缺乏肥料。经检讨决定各队结合生产准备进行思想教育，彻底解决群运与去年生产中遗留问题，精确计算准备春耕。并订出短期计划：十日内拔完花杆，修好棉田，所有秋地结合驮煤在二月中旬以前全部耙完，三月前解决半年燃料问题。积肥办法则以靠山薰荒，打坑土，挖地土，掏茅坑等办法力求解决，妇女儿童结合卫生运动负责扫街土，积脏水，干部则精确分工，深入各互助大队具体领导。（丕义、东魁、江河、浣清）
    【又讯】翻身结合生产的典型北流村，正整顿合作社结账分红准备大生产。该村土地改革胜利结束后，除整顿农业互助纺织大队外，合作社并积极进行结账分红，扩大股金。全村十三个作坊工厂股金二百五十万七千余元，三个月所得红利一百六十二万八千余元已大部分完。扩股方面，除信用部已扩股一百万七千元外，十天内合作社已收到新股十三万九千九百余元。经过这次分红，决定改变过去工人不赚工钱，按资金与劳力的多寡决定分红比例办法。如粉坊去年是按劳三资七分红，工人李糟续一年未得工资，欠下互助组七十多斤米，因此互助组不愿要他，他在粉坊作工也不积极了。经讨论决定改为劳二资八分红，工人每日得工资小米三斤，这样情绪都很高涨。轧花弹花厂原为二五分红（劳资各半），现改按劳七资三，这样，一架风弓由每天弹十五斤增至四十斤。改良工具上也订出新计划，以三万五千元买水磨一盘，一个牲口两个人一天能磨一石，（土磨只能磨二斗），可增产四倍，将所节省的四个牲口八个妇女用于驮炭织布，每月可赚十二万六千元，同时全村吃面问题可全部解决。木工厂去年做纺车一百余辆，手拉梭机七十余架，改手拉梭机一百余架，解决了附近六七个村纺织工具问题。现又试做双轮纺车，并决定在风子驼设立分厂，投资二十万元，利用富余资金，提高生产技术，扶植本村及外村生产，是北流今后发展的新方向。（＠田、心然）
