    Li Youcai Comes to Life on Stage
    Impressions After Seeing the People's Theater Perform "The Ballad of Li Youcai"
    After seeing the People's Theater's performance of "The Ballad of Li Youcai," I couldn't help but think: It's a pity that such a truly vivid peasant drama cannot be moved to stages in Shanghai and other places. If it were possible, wouldn't it also cause a sensation in the theater world and win the same honor as the novel "The Ballad of Li Youcai"?
    During the years of the War of Resistance, I don't remember seeing realistic peasants on the stage in the Great Rear Area. Peasants rarely became the main characters in dramas, and if they occasionally appeared, they were just intellectuals dressed in peasant clothing. In Yan'an, peasant roles were played vividly and realistically. In my memory, the more simple and profound ones seemed to be only a few short plays from Lu Xun Academy of Arts and the yangge dances of the Northwest Worker-Peasant-Soldier Troupe. Living rural characters like those in "The Ballad of Li Youcai" can only be written by a writer like Zhao Shuli, who comes from the peasantry. And only a theater troupe like the People's Theater, which grows from the soil, can perform them.
    The characters of Li Youcai, Old Qin, Little Fu, and Yan Hengyuan on the stage all have excellent creations. Especially the roles of Li Youcai and Little Fu. One always maintains the right measure, even in the excited scenes of being locked out and driven away and the victory of the struggle, there is no superfluous emotional outburst inappropriate for a poor peasant accustomed to hardship; the other's energy permeates the entire play, vividly portraying a young peasant with a fearless and extremely strong rebellious spirit, naturally and without the slightest slackness. The other characters, such as De Gui, Little Fu's mother, Little Yuan's mother, and Little Shun, are also successful; the older actors use their deep life experiences and the excellent skills they have learned from local operas, mostly easily achieving the demands of the play; it is not easy for the young actors to have such good achievements. Naturally, to some extent, people will still feel that they are not acting from the heart, and the flavor of the play is a little lacking. For example, the psychological pain of Chen Xiaoyuan's role in changing from good to bad and then from bad to frank introspection towards a cadre from a poor peasant background is not expressed. The coolie nature of Old Yang's role and the stirring spirit of approaching and understanding the masses through labor are also not prominently highlighted. (Of course, this is also because the playwright did not emphasize this scene.)
    The script's adaptation and direction not only faithfully embodies the spirit of the original work, but also incorporates many new experiences of the land reform struggle, greatly strengthening the educational and propaganda significance of this play. The increase in the scene of Yan Hengyuan deceiving and forcing Little Yuan's mother to remarry to the point of jumping off a cliff, Little Fu's face-to-face questioning of Little Yuan whether he really sent him to weed the fields, and Little Yuan's affirmative scene, which makes the places written in one stroke in the novel more visualized; all make class hatred clear and the atmosphere of struggle strengthened, which shows that the adapters and directors have worked hard. The final disposal of each character is also generally appropriate. But one point is worth raising for discussion, that is, in the final struggle scene, without the full complaint of several peasants who have suffered the most (such as Little Yuan's mother not appearing), it immediately turns to tying up and beating, and the power of persuasion does not seem to be strong enough. Some acts and scenes (such as Act II) are slightly lax. But basically, this adaptation and direction can be said to be successful. I noticed the audience under the stage. The progress of the play attracted more and more people, applauding three times for Little Fu and others making fun of the landlords and lackeys, and shouting "Go!" when Yan Hengyuan was tied up. Everyone understood and loved it very much. After seeing this play, they will surely be more convinced of the power of the masses themselves, and realize that the cunning rule of the landlords can eventually be overthrown.
    The People's Theater has very high artistic achievements, but unfortunately I know too little about the theater itself and its actors. It is a pity that I cannot praise their successful character creations one by one, like praising a writer.

    李有才活上舞台
    看人民剧团演出《李有才板话》后零感
    看了人民剧团演出的《李有才板话》。不禁想道：可惜这样真这样活的农民剧不能搬到上海等地舞台上去演，如果可能时，也一定会轰动剧坛，博得和小说《李有才板话》一样的荣誉的吧？
    抗战几年中，不记得在大后方的舞台上曾看到过逼真的农民。农民很少成为剧中主角，剧中偶然有也不过是穿了农民服装的知识分子。在延安，农民角色演得活而且真，印象中较为朴素深刻的，似乎也只有鲁艺的一两出短剧和西北文工团的秧歌中有几个。像李有才板话中这些活生生的农村人物，只有赵树理这样从农民中来的作家才能写得出。也只有人民剧团这样从土地中生长出来的剧团才演得出。
    舞台上的李有才、老秦、小福、和阎恒元的性格，都有很优秀的创造。特别是李有才和小福两角，一个始终掌握分寸，纵然在被封门赶出和斗争胜利那样激动的场面，也没有多余的不适合于一个受惯苦难的贫农的感情流露出来；一个精力弥漫全剧，把一个天不怕地不怕的反抗性极强的青年农民活现出来，很自然而又毫不懈怠。其余像得贵、小福娘、小元娘、小顺等角，也都成功；老年的演员运用他们深切的生活体验和从地方剧中学到的优长的技巧，大多架轻就熟的达成了剧的要求；青年演员们能有这么好的成就，已不容易，自然，多少还会使人感到没有从内心演出，戏味差一些。如陈小元一角对一个贫农出身的干部由好变坏，再由坏转到坦白反省，这样转变中心理的痛苦，就没有表现出来。老杨一角的雇农本色以及从劳动中接近和了解群众的扇动的气概，也都未显著的突出。（自然，这也由于编剧没强调这个场面。）
    剧本的编导，不仅忠实地体会了原作的精神，而且融合了不少翻身斗争新的经验，使这出戏的教育和宣传意义都大大加强。阎恒元骗逼小元娘去改嫁以至跳崖一场的增加，小福当面质问小元是否真是派他锄苗，小元肯定一场对小说中一笔写出的地方的形象化；都使阶级仇恨分明，斗争气氛加强，足见编导人是用了苦心的。各个人物最后的处置大体也都适当。但有一点值得提出商量，就是最后斗争场面，没有经过几个受害最深农民的充分诉苦，（如小元娘即未出场）立即转入捆打，说服力量似乎还不够大。有些幕和场（如第二幕），稍嫌松懈。但基本上，这次改编导演，可以说是成功的。我注意台下的观众，剧的进行，吸引得人越来越多，三次为小福等耍笑了地主和狗腿们而鼓掌，捆起阎恒元时高喊加油，大家看得很懂也很爱。看过这出戏后，他们一定会更加相信群众自己的力量，认识出狡猾的地主统制最后终是可以推倒的。
    人民剧团的艺术成就很高，可惜我对剧团本身和它的演员们，都知道得太少。很遗憾不能像表扬一个作家一样，对他们性格创造的成功一一表扬。
