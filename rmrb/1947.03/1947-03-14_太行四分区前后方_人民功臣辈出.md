　　Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district, Both Front and Rear
    People's Heroes Emerge
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district, both at the front and in the rear, has enthusiastically launched a campaign to earn merit in response to the sub-district's call. In Bo'ai County, under unified leadership, the cadres' teams, armed work teams, independent battalions, and the Public Security Bureau all set targets for annihilating the enemy in advance, sparking a competition. The best teams aimed to eliminate thirty enemies per month, some squads proposed eliminating three enemies per month, and some soldiers aimed to capture one or two enemies individually. The morale of the soldiers in the independent battalion was extremely high, with some companies rushing down the mountains before dawn. On February 9th, the Fifth District took the lead, capturing an investigator from the Yu-Bei Office of the enemy, earning the first merit. On the 11th, this company captured ten enemies in one fell swoop in Guitun, seizing one machine gun and five rifles. The county reported victories and sent prisoners one after another, even four victories in a single day, greatly encouraging other units. Unit 1046 stipulated concrete measures for everyone from cadres to soldiers, from individuals to units: individual merit awards ranged from 500 to 3,000 (currency not specified), while unit awards were 10,000 to 20,000 for a celebratory meal, as well as taking photos under the red flag and public praise in the newspaper. In addition to general regulations, the competition conditions for each battalion and company also included unity in combat, adherence to good discipline, and ensuring no loss of honor. The Third Battalion proposed, "We will be in the vanguard in any battle!" Soldiers in each company enthusiastically discussed this, late into the night. In the battle to recover Wen County, the brave soldiers of Unit 46 vied to earn merit, annihilating two enemy companies in one fell swoop, while Units 55, 1044, 77, and 44, among others, captured around one hundred enemies each. During the pursuit and annihilation in the snow, many soldiers lost their shoes and suffered frostbite, without uttering a sound; some soldiers passed by their homes without even turning their heads. In Wu Zhi County, the militia and armed work teams of each district launched thirteen independent operations behind enemy lines in January and February, killing and capturing 156 enemy troops and puppet soldiers, and seizing 25 rifles and 300 rounds of ammunition. They recovered 106 villages, and thirty villages voluntarily handed over more than 8,000 jin of public grain and more than 200,000 (currency not specified) in public funds. Ren Xiuhe's armed work team in Jiaozuo captured four enemy platoon leaders and below, earning their third meritorious service. The Second Detachment of Qin-nan annihilated fifteen enemies in Xiao Si. A squad from Unit 47 ambushed in Tianmen, seizing one machine gun. For these people's heroes, the sub-district political department has unified and finely produced merit books, distributing them to each unit. Led by the Qin Branch in the military, Units 44 and 66 used the lulls in combat to launch movements to air grievances, transitioning to revenge, laying a deep ideological foundation for the merit-earning campaign. Currently, the sub-district merit-earning campaign has spread from the front to various rear organs. Seven comrades from the sub-district political department have already been recognized in the merit books, and the telephone bureau and hospital have both selected merit-earning committees, setting specific standards. The hospital treated twice as many wounded and sick soldiers in February as in January, with doctors voluntarily contributing money to create new treatments. (Yan Xin, Liu Bo)
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After receiving instructions from the sub-district political department on launching a campaign to earn merit for the people, the Tai Gu Independent Battalion immediately held various large and small meetings, elected merit evaluation committees, and stipulated merit standards as follows: ensure the completion of tasks and create experience, have a conscious sense of organization and discipline, be able to save and not waste, have a hardworking style, be able to study regularly, improve political, cultural, and military technical levels, be brave in combat, execute battlefield discipline, and have gains. The scoring method for seizures: one light machine gun 10 points, one light cannon 7 points, one Arisaka rifle 7 points, one grenade launcher 5 points, one rifle 5 points for every seven, one point for every five bullets, one point for a bayonet. Slogans included: "Sweat more in peacetime, bleed less in wartime." "Practice diligently in peacetime, don't panic on the battlefield." "Strive to win more victories and usher in the light!" "Those without merit earn merit, those with merit add merit to merit," etc.
