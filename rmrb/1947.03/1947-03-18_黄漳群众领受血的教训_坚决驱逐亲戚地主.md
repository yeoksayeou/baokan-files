　　Huangzhang Masses Learn a Bloody Lesson:
    Resolutely Expel Landlord Relatives
    [This Dispatch from Zuoquan] Having learned the lesson of feeding wolves who devour people, the masses of Huangzhang Village in the Fifth District have thoroughly broken with the landlords. During this in-depth movement in the village, a backward peasant, Wang Bingyuan, revealed that his daughter had previously been forced by the landlord Liu Shihua to wear good clothes inside to deceive the masses, and after the movement, the clothes were taken off again. However, after Wang Bingyuan spoke out, Liu secretly threatened him, saying, "Humph! You spoke out to struggle against me, you won't escape either!" Wang Bingyuan was frightened and was forced to jump off a cliff on February 28th and died. This bloody fact stirred up the entire village of peasants, and everyone said with gnashing teeth: "We are feeding wolves who devour people! In the past, because Liu Shihua had two sons working outside, we took care of him and let him openly donate land, but who knew he was a beast in human clothing, and actually did such a thing!" Thus, they launched a fierce struggle against Liu, exposing and accusing him of his deep and serious crimes. The more the masses accused, the angrier they became, but Liu did not yield at all. After a search, it turned out that he was wearing many silk clothes, and had hidden 20,000 Jicha notes. The three women in his family were wearing a total of twenty-seven good clothes. Also, 17,000 Jicha notes were found on another landlord woman. In this way, some of the masses who previously thought it was "almost enough" saw that the struggle against the landlords was not thorough enough. Many people said: "Landlord, you are full of tricks. We all have clear eyes. Today, we won't let you get away without repaying your blood debt!" Shi Geng, who had not participated in the struggle in the past and had delivered letters to the landlord, became an activist this time. He said: "Landlords harm people everywhere. Before the movement, they asked us to keep things for them, and after the movement, they wanted them back, and even forced our people to death. We will settle this account with him!" Wang Guangcai, who used to be silent, jumped up and shouted loudly: "Let's all unite! We must fight the landlords to the end!" The masses shouted together: "Never feed wolves who devour people again!" After the meeting, the peasant Wang Shanen angrily issued an eviction order to the landlord relative hiding in his house: "My family ate chaff and vegetable leaves during the famine years, and you hoarded grain that rotted and wouldn't lend it to us. You can't eat and drink in my house today!" As he spoke, he pushed the landlord out of the door. Zhang Wujiu handed over all the clothes and belongings of the landlord Zhang Liuhua (his aunt) stored in his house to the farmers' association and drove her out of his house: "Landlords are all bad people, get out of here! I don't care if you're a relative or not!" Deng Yinzhu, who used to be the most backward peasant, also took out the things his wife had hidden for his wife's sister (the landlord). When his mother-in-law (the landlord) ran to his house from behind the door, he resolutely refused to let her in. Now the whole village, regardless of men or women, has all been swept into the upsurge of resolutely breaking with the landlords and is continuing to thoroughly settle accounts with the landlords.

　　黄漳群众领受血的教训
    坚决驱逐亲戚地主
    【本报左权讯】接受喂狼吃人血的教训，五区黄漳村群众彻底与地主分家。该村这次深入运动中，落后农民王丙元说出自己闺女以前被地主刘世华强迫替他将好衣服穿在里面，骗过群众，运动结束后又将衣服脱去。但王丙元说了后，刘即暗中威胁说：“哼！你说了斗争我，你也跑不脱！”王丙元害怕，于二月二十八日被逼跳崖死了。血的事实激动了全村农民，大家咬牙切齿的说：“咱们喂狼吃人啦！过去因为刘世华有两个儿在外参加工作，咱们照顾了他，让他开明献田，谁知他人面兽心，竟做出这样事来！”于是向刘展开猛烈斗争，揭发控诉其深重罪恶。群众越诉越怒，但刘却毫不低头，大家一搜，原来他身上穿着许多绸缎衣服，并藏有冀钞二万元，他家三个女人身上共穿着廿七件好衣服。又在另一个地主女人身上也追出冀钞一万七千元。这样，有些群众以前认为“差不多”了的，都看到了地主斗得不彻底，许多人说：“地主你鬼许多。俺们大家眼睛明。今天不你还血债不依你！”史更和过去不参加斗争，给地主送过信，这一次成了积极分子，他说：“地主处处害人，运动以前叫咱给他保存东西，运动以后又要回去，还逼死咱的人，跟他算这笔账！”过去不吭气的王光才跳起来大声喊：“咱们大家团结起来！要跟地主干到底！”群众一齐高呼：“再不要喂狼吃人！”会后，农民王善恩怒冲冲地给躲在他家地主亲戚下了逐客令：“我家灾荒年吃糠咽菜，你存的粮食烂了也不借给俺，你今天不能在我家吃喝！”说着即将地主推出门外。张五九把地主张榴花（他姑姑）存在他家的衣物统统交给农会，并将其赶出家门：“地主没一个好人，给我滚吧！不管你亲戚不亲戚！”邓银柱从前是个最落后的农民，也把他老婆给他妻妹（地主）藏的东西拿出来，他岳母（地主）被门后跑到他家，也坚决不叫进门。现在全村不分男女，已全部卷入坚决与地主分家的热潮，继续向地主进行彻底清算。
