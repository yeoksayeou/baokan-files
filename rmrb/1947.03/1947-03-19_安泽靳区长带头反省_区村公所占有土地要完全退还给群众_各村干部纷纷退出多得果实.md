[Report from this newspaper] Anze is deploying a land reform movement to investigate the sealing of land to fill loopholes. In mid-February, each district and village convened meetings of cadres and activists to mobilize cadres to engage in self-criticism. The question of "Whose tails should be cut off? Whose loopholes should be filled?" was clarified, with the requirement to ensure: peasants fully express their grievances, poverty roots are thoroughly dug out, and tails are cut off. Zhao Qiyin, chairman of the Shicao Farmers' Association in the Ninth District, reflected on his relationship as a "sworn brother" with the landlord Kong Xianmi, stating that he was unwilling for the masses to struggle against Kong, and thus the masses dared not speak out. Wang Qinghai, vice chairman of the Qinbi Farmers' Association, reflected that he considered the poor peasant Wang Donghai a backward element, and therefore did not lead him in settling accounts with the feudal rich peasant Meng Xiniu. Through everyone's self-criticism, forty-five households of peasants who had not thoroughly turned themselves over were discovered throughout the district. At a meeting of village cadres in the Eleventh District, District Chief Jin Wenhua reflected that in the past, district and village offices had occupied land seized from struggle by the masses, totaling twenty-five mu in Shangdeng and eight other villages alone, and that this should be completely returned to the masses in the future. Wang Fucai, director of the District Armed Forces Committee, reflected: "In the past struggle, I was allocated ten mu more land and also bought some furniture cheaply. Now I feel that none of this was right, and I want to completely return it to the masses." Following this, village cadres also conducted candid self-criticisms, and all were willing to voluntarily return excess gains or cheaply purchased items to the masses.
