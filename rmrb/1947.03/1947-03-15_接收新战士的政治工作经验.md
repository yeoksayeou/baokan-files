　　Political Work Experience in Receiving New Soldiers
    ·Nan Fei·
    At present, as the flames of the War of Self-Defense are raging, large numbers of young and middle-aged people in the Liberated Areas have turned themselves over and are consciously and enthusiastically joining the army to defend their homes and fields and defeat the Chiang Kai-shek army. As a result, our troops are constantly adding new members. This situation should arouse our attention to the work of new recruits. Now, let's briefly introduce some experiences in political work when receiving new recruits for the reference of comrades in the same work position.
    I. In order to eliminate the family concerns of new soldiers and lay the ideological foundation for intense military training in the future, the best way to assemble new soldiers is to receive them locally and bring them back for training. First, select capable cadres to form organizational structures at the regimental, battalion, and company levels, and go to the troop receiving point to carry out the receiving work. Conduct a period of reorganization there before bringing them back for training. The reorganization time should not be too long, at most a week. During the reorganization period, on the one hand, send people to select a good training location (the location must have good mass conditions, be stable, have convenient firewood, water and food, and have relatively concentrated houses), and prepare training equipment, such as wooden hand grenades, straw targets, aiming tools, various obstacles and training ground settings.
    II. It is necessary to conduct preliminary investigation and research. Formulate various registration and statistical forms, and cooperate with local cadres to understand the following issues in as much detail as possible: 1. The methods and methods used in mobilizing soldiers, the motives and ideological characteristics of new soldiers in joining the army; 2. Local cadres, mass leaders and activists who take the lead in joining the army; 3. Local customs, people's living conditions, and land reform situation (new areas, old areas), that is, the social environment in which the new soldiers are located; 4. The composition and background of the new soldiers (peasants who have turned themselves over, objects of struggle, young students, former puppet troops, etc.), age and general political level, and cultural level; 5. Physical height, strength, and whether there are any diseases.
    III. Then, according to the investigated and understood materials, immediately carry out universal and strict review work. Draw responsible cadres from local cadres and military cadres to form a review committee or review team, and send medical staff to participate, discuss together, determine the review standards, and conduct the review to avoid disputes between the local and military on the quality of new soldiers. When reviewing, it is necessary to prevent the local cadres' simple task viewpoint, focusing on quantity but not quality; and the military cadres' simple and perfunctory, impatient, and careless faults. Everyone should be responsible to the people's army, responsible for the War of Self-Defense, and resolutely wash away the old, young, sick, weak, and disabled new soldiers who do not meet the conditions for being soldiers, so that the new soldiers feel that joining the army is not easy, and truly experience the glory of revolutionary soldiers. If necessary, a grand enlistment ceremony can be held. If elimination is carried out when training begins, the impact will be very bad. Or if special agents are absorbed, the harm will be even greater. In addition, during the review, attention should also be paid to discovering talents with special skills, and registering them so that they can be used properly.
    IV. Establish organizations and do not disperse them temporarily. When establishing organizations, take the village, district, and county as units, and the principle is not to disperse them temporarily. However, appropriate adjustments should be made to activists and new soldier party members to ensure that there are activists in the class and party members in the platoon to ensure our leadership over the new soldiers. When assigning cadres, we must take care of the local cadres and mass leaders who take the lead in joining the army and place them in the cadre positions at the squad and platoon levels. If cadres from the county and district take the lead in joining the army, with the consent of the regimental committee and the approval of the higher authorities, the order can be officially announced and they can serve as battalion and company cadres. If the local area has already completed the establishment and the cadres are complete when assembling the new soldiers, the cadres who go to receive the new soldiers should insert themselves into the work through them. Generally, do not change the originally equipped local cadres. If it is really inappropriate when training starts, then mobilize and replace them.
    V. Turning an ordinary person into a soldier, in his opinion, this change from civilian to soldier is a revolution, which will produce many large and small "ideological knots" that cannot be untied. For example: In the struggle to turn over and become masters, land has been distributed and life has been improved. It is good to be an ordinary person at home, but Chiang Kai-shek is going to attack the Liberated Areas, and in order to defend the fruits of the struggle, it is necessary to come out and be a soldier. What should I do? After joining the army mobilization and current affairs education, it is considered that joining the army is necessary, but after joining the army, there are many difficulties left at home. Can they be solved? Seeing the preferential treatment and the welcome, farewell, and condolences when enlisting, it is considered glorious to join the army; however, the army has to fight, and fighting requires people to die. Will it happen to oneself? It is good to have acquaintances together, they understand each other, and their tempers are known, but when they are with veteran soldiers, they have experience, they are confident in fighting, and they will not suffer losses. Is it better to disperse or not to disperse?… In general, there are only two problems: one is homesickness, and the other is fear of death. Therefore, when receiving new soldiers, political work should take care of the ideological characteristics of the new soldiers, untie the "ideological knots" for the new soldiers, and master the ideological leadership of the new soldiers. Call on them to eliminate concerns, boldly reflect, open up their baggage, put down their baggage, and patiently explain and educate them. For example, the family difficulty problem, either their own requirements are too high and cannot be handled; or the village cadres made inappropriate promises when mobilizing soldiers and cannot be realized, should be explained clearly. At the same time, stipulate "transformation of the motive for joining the army and supplementary mobilization education" as the political education policy for the first week after receiving new soldiers. Combining the glorious deeds when joining the army and the basic spirit of armed defense of the fruits of turning over, unify understanding, overcome impure motives, and wavering emotions, so that new soldiers can serve in the army with peace of mind.
    VI. Not only to eliminate the "ideological knots" of new soldiers, but also to solve the practical problems of new soldiers. These are two aspects of the same problem. Gather and sort out the specific and reasonable problems raised by the new soldiers by village, and then cooperate with the village cadres to solve them thoroughly, settle the families of the new soldiers, and the new soldiers and village cadres jointly make a guarantee, the village cadres put forward a guarantee that their family problems will be solved in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations, and the new soldiers put forward a guarantee that they will study in the army with peace of mind and will not desert. The guarantee is copied in triplicate (also known as the three-part form), one copy is kept by the district and village, one copy is kept by the army, and one copy is kept by the new soldier.
    VII. After these due tasks are completed, when the troops are about to be brought back for training, new soldiers can be mobilized to write letters to their families and local cadres to bid farewell, express their determination, and organize a warm welcome and farewell along the village through the local system. The cadres on duty in the district and village can accompany the new soldiers to the troop station, which will play a great role in stabilizing and consolidating the emotions of the new soldiers, and can also eliminate the new soldiers' dissatisfaction with the local cadres and mobilization methods. During the march, it is necessary to strengthen cultural and entertainment work, pay attention to consolidating the troops, take care of the sick, and organize a reception team to keep the new soldiers in a vigorous and full state of tension.
    VIII. Pay close attention to mass discipline, establish a preliminary management system (such as duty system, leave system, roll call system, family reception system, etc.), appropriately improve living conditions, and ensure material supply.

### 接收新战士的政治工作经验

　　接收新战士的政治工作经验
    ·南飞·
    目前当自卫战争烽火正炽，解放区大批青壮已翻身自觉，为保家保田打败蒋军踊跃参军，因而我们部队不断有新的成员增加，这种情况，极应引起我们对于新兵工作的重视。现在，先把接收新兵时政治工作的点滴经验，简略介绍一下，以供同一工作岗位的同志们参考。
    一、为了解除新战士的家庭顾虑，奠定以后紧张大练兵的思想基础，新战士集合起来以后，最好的办法，是就地接收，带回训练。先选派得力干部，分别组成团营连各级组织机构，到受兵地点，进行接收工作，在那里进行一个时期整理，再带回训练。整理时间不宜太长，至多一个礼拜。在整理期间，要一面派人选好训练地点（选择驻地时，必须是群众条件好的，安定的，柴水粮食方便的，而且房子比较集中的），准备好训练器材，如木质手榴弹，草靶，瞄准用具，各种障碍及操场设置等。
    二、要进行初步的调查研究工作。制定各项登记统计表格，协同地方干部，尽可能做到比较详尽的了解到下面一些问题：１、在动员参军时所采用的方式方法，新战士的入伍动机及思想特点；２、带头参军的地方干部群众领袖与积极分子；３、当地风俗人情，人民生活状况，土地改革情形（新区、老区）即新战士所处的社会环境；４、新战士的成份出身，（翻身农民，斗争对象，青年学生、当过顽伪军等）年龄及一般政治水平、文化水平；５、体格高低、强弱、有无疾病。
    三、然后，根据调查了解的材料，立即进行普遍的又是严格的审查工作。由地方干部与部队干部中抽出负责干部，组成审查委员会或审查小组，并派医务人员参加，共同商议，确定审查标准，进行审查，以避免地方与部队对新战士质量的争论。审查时，要防止地方干部的单纯任务的观点，重量不重质；与部队干部简单潦草，不耐心、不细心的毛病。大家以对人民军队负责，对自卫战争负责的精神，把不合当兵条件的老小病弱残废的新战士，坚决洗刷下去，使新战士感到入伍并不容易，真正体验到革命军人的光荣。必要时可举行隆重的入伍仪式。如果到训练开始，再去消洗，影响是非常坏的。或者吸收了特务分子，危害就更大。此外，在审查中，还要注意发现有特殊技能的人才，登记起来，以便才得其用。
    四、建立组织，暂不编散。建立组织时，以村区县为单位，以暂不编散为原则。但是对于积极分子与新战士党员要作适当调整，做到班有积极分子，排有党员，保证我们对新战士的领导。配备干部时，一定要照顾带头参军的地方干部与群众领袖，把他们安放在班排两级的干部位置上。有县和区的干部带头参军的，经过团委会同意，上级批准，可正式公布命令，充任营连干部。如果地方上在集合新兵时，已经编制就绪，干部齐全的话，去接收新兵的干部，就通过他们，插入工作，一般对原来配备的地方干部，不要更动，到开始训练时，实在不合适，再行动员抽换。
    五、把一个老百姓变成兵，在他说，这种由民到兵的变化，是一个革命，会产生许多大大小小的“思想圪塔”解不开。如：在翻身斗争中分得了土地，生活有了办法，在家当老百姓好，但是蒋介石要进攻解放区，为了保卫斗争果实，又需要出来当兵，怎么办？经过参军动员与事时教育，认为参军是应该的，但是参军以后，家里留下许多困难，能不能得到解决呢？看到优军及入伍时的欢迎欢送慰劳，认为参军光荣；但是，军队要打仗，打仗要死人，会不会死到自己头上呢？熟人在一块很好，说话也懂，脾气又摸，但是，和老战士在一块，人家有经验，打仗有把握，不会吃亏，究竟分散好，还是不分散好呢？……诸如此类的问题，总起只有两个：一个是想家，一个是怕死。因此，在接收新兵时，政治工作就要照顾到新战士的思想特点，为新战士解开“思想圪塔”，掌握对新战士的思想领导。号召取消顾虑，大胆反省，打开包袱，放下包袱，耐心进行解释教育，如家庭困难问题，或者是自己要求过高，无法处理；或者是在动员参军时，村干部给予了不适当的诺言，不能实现，都要讲清楚。同时，规定“改造入伍动机及参军的补助动员教育”，为接收新兵后第一周的政治教育方针。结合参军时的光荣事迹及武装保卫翻身果实的基本精神，统一认识，克服动机不纯，摇摆不定的情绪，做到新战士能安心当兵。
    六、不仅解除新战士的“思想圪塔”，也要解决新战士的实际问题。这是一个问题的两方面。把新战士提出的具休的合理的问题，以村为单位，集合整理到一块，然后协同村干部给以彻底解决，把新战士的家安顿好，由新战士与村干部自订保证书，村干部提出来以后保证按优待条例解决他们的家中问题，新战士提出来保证到部队安心学习，不开小差。保证书复写三份（亦称三联单），区村保存一份，部队保存一份，新战士自己保存一份。
    七、这些应有的工作进行完毕，临到带部队回来训练时，可发动新战士向家里，向地方干部写信辞别，表示决心，并且通过地方系统，组织沿村热烈欢迎欢送，区村在职干部能陪送新战士到部队驻地，对新战士的情绪稳定与巩固上会起很大作用，也可以消除新战士对地方干部与动员方式的不满情绪。在行军途中，必须加强文化娱乐工作，注意巩固部队，照顾病号，组织收容队，使新战士一直保持着旺盛饱满的紧张情绪。
    八、要十分注意群众纪律，建立初步的管理制度，（如值日制度、请假制度、点名制度、家属接见制度等。）适当改善生活，保证物质供给。
