Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th (Delayed dispatch) United Press Washington, 6th dispatch: After declaring on the 24th that "aid to Greece is of extreme importance to the United States," U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, on the eve of his departure for Moscow, also released a note from the United States to the Soviet Chairman of the Allied Control Commission for Hungary and the governments of the Soviet Union, Hungary, and the United Kingdom, opposing the arrest by the Soviet occupation authorities of Kófa, former Secretary-General of the Smallholders Party, who actively organized anti-Soviet terrorist groups, and accusing the Soviet Union of "interfering in Hungary's internal affairs." Hungary is still a defeated nation under Allied control, and the Allied Control Commission has the right to punish all fascist activities. The Hungarian government is currently a coalition government composed of the Smallholders Party, the Communist Party, and the Social Democratic Party. Within the Smallholders Party, there are two factions: one faction consists of democratic and progressive elements who support Hungary's democratic reforms; the other faction consists of reactionary elements who oppose land reform and collude with the remnants of the former Horthy feudal fascists, attempting to drag the country back to the Horthy era under "foreign interference."

　　马歇尔曾致苏联照会竟反对逮捕匈反动派
    【新华社延安八日电】（迟到）据合众社华盛顿六日电：美国务卿马歇尔继二十四日声明“援助希腊对美国极关重要”之后，复于启程赴莫斯科之前夕公布美国致匈牙利盟国管委会苏联主席及苏、匈、英三国政府之照会一件，其中反对苏联占领军当局逮捕积极组织反苏恐怖团体之小地主党前总书记柯法克并指责苏联“干涉匈国内政”。按匈牙利现仍为战败国，在盟国管制之下，盟管制委员会有权惩办一切法西斯活动。匈牙利政府现为小地主党、共产党及社会民主党所合组之联合政府，小地主党内有两派，一派为民主进步分子，赞成匈牙利的民主改革；另一派为反动分子，反对土地改革，并勾结前霍尔第封建法西斯的余孽，企图在“外国干涉”下把国家拉回霍尔第时代。
