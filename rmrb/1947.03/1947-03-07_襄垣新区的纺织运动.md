　　The textile industry in the new district of Xiangyuan was very developed before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Every family had a loom, and every woman had a spinning wheel. In addition to self-sufficiency, more than 200,000 catties of cloth could be exported annually. The net profit from cotton was more than 250,000 catties. Textile was one of the main incomes of local farmers. When the Japanese invaders occupied the area, they banned the sale of cotton. Anyone who had a catty of cotton in their home would be charged with a crime. Due to the interruption of cotton supply, the textile industry was almost completely destroyed. For more than six years, there was no sound of weaving in the countryside, and most young women did not know how to spin and weave. The cloth stored by farmers over the years was all worn out, and homespun cloth almost disappeared.
　　In the autumn of 1945, Xiangyuan was completely liberated. The county government called on people to restore textile production and provided large loans and cotton to the masses. The textile industry quickly recovered. Last year on "March 8th" (International Women's Day), women in Xiang County held a meeting and put forward the slogan: "Everyone should spin and weave, and the old and middle-aged should teach the young." After a year of effort, most young women have learned to spin and weave. Among the 34,000 women, more than 11,000 know how to spin and weave. All the textile tools have also been repaired. There are now 17,000 spinning wheels. For every ten spinning wheels, there are eight spinners. There are 500 looms, an average of one loom for every 40 spinners. There are a total of 1,200 cotton bows (old-fashioned), an average of one for every 18 spinners. After emancipation, the productive capital of farmers has greatly increased, and they are actively making and buying new tools. In the first district alone, four new-style wind bow cotton gins (made in Xingtai) and three hand-pulled shuttle looms have been purchased. Women's enthusiasm for spinning and weaving is unprecedentedly high. Even women in the urban area who never engaged in spinning and weaving are now spinning and weaving.
　　In order to thoroughly restore and develop textile production in the new district, the county leadership called on every spinner to be able to weave 7.5 catties of cloth in the spring and complete 17 catties throughout the year. In late February, the county cooperative held a meeting of cadres from various district cooperatives and women's rescue associations to study and develop the following methods for developing textile production in the new district: 1. Eliminate the masses' fear of getting rich. After the mass movement, some people have the idea of "wanting to get rich but being afraid of getting rich," thinking that "having money will lead to struggle." This seriously hinders the development of textile production. Therefore, it is specifically stated that "getting rich through labor will never lead to struggle," and the story of Wu Manyou's laboring to get rich should be widely publicized. The "March 8th" Women's Day will be commemorated in advance, and women's symposiums will be held by district to eliminate ideological obstacles to the development of textile production. 2. Organize as much as possible. At present, it is not required to be universal, but to organize with emphasis and gradually expand. Learn from the experience and lessons of the old district and guard against formalism. 3. Improve technology on the basis of universal spinning and weaving. At present, the first requirement is to universally use wide cloth with old machines, and the cloth surface should be at least 1.2 feet wide. Develop wind bow cotton gins as much as possible. The county cooperative will specially train a group of technicians to provide technical guidance. At present, each district has a small textile factory specializing in training technicians for hand-pulled shuttle machines and gradually promoting them. 4. From raw material supply to finished product sales, the county cooperative will supply cotton in large quantities. The district cooperatives will play the role of exchanging cotton for cloth, and each village cooperative will set up one to three people to implement the method of exchanging cloth for cotton, going deep into each household to collect cloth and give cotton, so as to use cotton to support cloth and cloth to support cotton. 5. Solve the problem of tool shortage. At present, the most pressing problem is the shortage of cotton bows. In addition to being responsible for solving the problem of bowstrings, the county cooperative should also help the masses purchase wind bow cotton gins in large quantities.
　　Emancipated women's textile capital has increased. At present, each spinner has more than three catties of cotton in stock, and they have generally started spinning and weaving in the late first month of the lunar calendar. It is expected that when the spring textile plan is completed, the women's spinning and weaving in the new district of Xiangyuan will exceed the pre-war level. (Taihang Branch)

　　襄垣新区的纺织运动
    襄垣新区纺织事业，抗战前就很发达，家家有织机，妇女人人有纺车，产布除自给外，每年尚可输出二十余万斤。净赚棉花在二十五万斤以上，纺织是当地农民主要收入之一。日寇占据时，禁止棉花买卖，家存一斤棉花者，即要论罪，由于棉花来源断绝，纺织事业，摧残殆尽，六年多、农村不闻机杼声，年轻的妇女便多半不会纺织，农家历年存的衣布都穿尽净，土布几乎绝迹。
    三十四年秋，襄垣全境解放，县府号召恢复纺织，并大量给群众贷款贷花，纺织事业，迅即恢复。去年“三八”，襄县妇女集会，提出：“人人纺织起来，老年中年教青年”的口号，经一年努力，青年妇女大部已学会纺织。三万四千妇女中，会纺织者即有一万一千余人。纺织工具也全部修复。现共有纺车一万七千架，十个纺车，已有八架纺车，织布机五百架，平均四十个纺妇有一架，弹花弓（旧式）共有一千二百张，约十八个纺妇平均一张。经过翻身，农民生产资本大增，积极制买新式工具，仅一区新买风弓弹花机（邢台制）即有四架，手拉梭织布机三架。妇女纺织情绪，空前高涨，从不闹纺织的城关妇女，现在也纺织起来了。
    县领导上为了彻底恢复与发展新区纺织，号召每个纺妇春季要能织布七斤半，全年完成十七斤。县联社特于二月下旬，召开各区联社，妇救会干部会，对于开展新区纺织，研究出如下办法：一、消除群众怕发财思想。经过大运动，群众中有些存在“想发财又怕发财”思想，认为“有钱就要斗”。严重的障碍着纺织的开展。为此特肯定提出：“劳动发财，决不斗争”，并要广泛的宣传吴满有劳动发家的故事，“三八”妇女节提前纪念，以区为单位，召开妇女座谈会，消除开展纺织的思想障碍。二、尽可能的组织起来。目前不要求普遍进行，是有重点的组织，逐渐扩展。接受老区经验教训，谨防形式主义。三、在普遍纺织起来的基础上提高技术。目前首先要求普遍做到旧机用宽布，布面至少尺二宽。尽可能的发展风弓弹花机，由县联社专门训练一批技师，作技术指导。现各区都有一个小型纺织厂，专训手拉梭机技术人财，逐渐推广。四、原料供给到成品推销，由县联社大批供给棉花，各区联社起花布兑换庄的作用，各村合作社专设一人至三人，实行布包换花的办法，深入各户，收布给花，做到随织随换。以花养布，以布养花。五、解决工具困难。目前最迫切的问题是弹花弓太少，县联社除负责解决弓弦问题外，并要帮助群众大量购买风弓弹花机。
    翻身妇女纺织资本增加，现每个纺妇存花均在三斤以上，旧历正月下旬，已普遍纺织起来了。预计春季纺织计划完成时，襄垣新区妇纺事众，将超过战前。（太行分社）
