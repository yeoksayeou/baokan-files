Overcoming "Good Enough" Mentality, Deepening the Fill-in-the-Gaps
　　Gaoyi Launches the "Three Comparisons" Movement
　　[This newspaper, Taihang, 15th dispatch] Gaoyi is currently carrying out a three comparisons movement - comparing class, comparing living conditions, and comparing emancipation - to continue checking and filling in the gaps. After the previous stage of the movement, many cadres harbored a "good enough" mentality, and the work could not be opened up. After each district convened village cadres and activist meetings, many "backward" villages were identified. Landlords still maintained feudal rule. Although some villages had undergone struggle and the landlords had indeed given some thin land and broken houses to the poor, most of the good land was still in the hands of feudal landlords, or only the cadres and a few activists had been emancipated, while the "backward" peasants had not yet moved, etc. These facts shattered the "good enough" mentality. The masses of Caoliu and Huacun villages, in comparing class, comparing living conditions, and comparing emancipation, compared the lives of the landlords after liquidation with the lives of the emancipated peasants, and immediately saw that the peasants had not been completely emancipated, and the landlords still had remnants of power. When comparing classes, the hired worker Zhang Laoxing said, "I have worked all my life, and now I still live in two broken houses, while the landlords still live in tall buildings and large courtyards." Guo Laojing said, "I have been emancipated, but all I have is some grain, but what about Guo Laozi (a managing landlord), Guo Zhenjiang, and Guo Liantou (feudal rich peasants)? What do they wear, what do they eat?" As such, the village discovered that 45 peasant households still needed to be filled in with houses and land, and the liquidation of 12 local bullies, landlords, and feudal rich peasants was not thorough. The reason for this was often that the landlords used false enlightenment and land dedication to deceive the cadres and activists. The peasants, after this awakening and improvement, all demanded that blood and sweat debts be thoroughly settled and land be recovered. In three days of speaking out and struggle, more than 200 mu of land, more than 270 houses, and more than 90 dan of grain were recovered. The two villages are now distributing the fruits of the struggle and continuing to fill in the gaps. The movement throughout the county is now also reaching a climax.

　　克服“差不多”思想深入填补
    高邑开展“三比”运动
    【本报太行十五日电】高邑刻正开展比阶级、比光景、比翻身的三比运动，继续检查填补。上段运动后，不少干部存在着“差不多”思想，工作打不开局面。经各区召开村干部与积极分子会，查出许多“落后”村。地主还保持着封建统治，有些村虽经斗争，地主也真给了穷人些薄地破房，但大部好地仍然掌握在封建地主手中，或则仅干部与少数积极分子翻了身，而“落后”农民尚未动等，这些事实打破了差不多思想。曹留与花村两村群众在比阶级与比光景、比翻身中，拿清算后的地主生活与翻身农民一比，即看出农民并未彻底翻身，地主还有尾巴。在比阶级时，雇工张老兴说：“我劳动了一辈子，现在还住两间破房，地主还住着高楼大院。”郭老景说：“我翻了身，可是光有些夺，人家郭老芝（经营地主），郭振江、郭连头（封建富农），穿的是甚，吃的是甚。”如此，该村共发现四十五户农民还须填补房子地，而十二户恶霸地主及封建富农，清算均不彻底；原因多系地主以假开明献地方式迷惑了干部与积极分子。农民经此觉悟提高，均要求彻底算清血汗账，收回土地。三天诉苦斗争，即收回土地二百余亩，房二百七十余间，粮食九十余石。该两村现正分配果实继续进行填补，全县运动现亦走上高潮。
