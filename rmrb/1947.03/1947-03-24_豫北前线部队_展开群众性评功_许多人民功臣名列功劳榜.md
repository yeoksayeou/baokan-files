    Troops on the Yubei Front
    Launch Mass Appraisal of Merits
    Many People's Heroes Listed on Rolls of Honor
    [This newspaper dispatch] Comrade Pei Chun reports from the Yubei front: After the Tangyin campaign, our troops on the Yubei front universally launched mass appraisals of merit, posted rolls of honor, and recorded merits in the merit books. Each unit's newspaper prominently published the names of those who had performed meritorious service, introducing their achievements. Among the cadres, those who were awarded merits by the front headquarters, in addition to the model commander, Company Commander Qin Qizhong, and the model political worker, Instructor Chen Qigui, also include Jiang Lianyi, the third company commander of the × Regiment. In the battle of Caojia, when the enemy counterattacked our forces, Company Commander Jiang personally led his troops in repeated hand-to-hand combat, finally repelling the enemy and retaking the position. Wang Genyuan, the tenth company commander of the × Regiment, and Xin Desheng, the deputy company commander, in the Yuanzhuang pursuit battle, faced an enemy more than four times our strength in a counter-offensive, and after several rounds of grenade and bayonet fighting, finally held the position firmly. In addition, Fang Wenju, the commander of the × Regiment, personally led a unit with very few casualties, captured seven bunkers southwest of Caojia in one fell swoop, annihilated an enemy company, and removed the threat to the flanks and rear of our attacking troops. Wang Haidong, the commander of the × Regiment (Political Commissar Wang Lilao commanded the assault team; Political Commissar Wang was knocked down by a landmine, got up and continued to advance. Deputy Regiment Commander Peng Shouqiu, after being wounded and treated, firmly refused to leave and continued fighting. Political Commissar Li Wenqing advanced with the assault team during the attack, calmly commanding, and organized cover during the retreat, holding out until the very end. Hu Wenzhang, the sixth company commander of the × Regiment, took the lead in the charge during the battle of Yuanzhuang. When the enemy counterattacked, he stubbornly resisted in the houses. Although the company suffered some losses, the morale of the entire company remained high due to the exemplary role and active explanation of Company Commander Hu. Li Xuehui, the political instructor of a certain company, personally led the assault team in the battles of Zhao's Factory and Deng's Family, both propagandizing and mobilizing, and using his own exemplary role to promote the entire company. This company was a new company, but under the leadership of Instructor Li, the company's combat style has caught up with the old companies. All of the above comrades were publicly praised by the front commander at the campaign summary meeting.
