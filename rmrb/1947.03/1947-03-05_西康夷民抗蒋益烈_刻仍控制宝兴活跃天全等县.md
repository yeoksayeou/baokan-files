Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Reports from Shanghai, Chongqing, and Chengdu newspapers indicate that victorious news of the armed uprising of the Han and Yi people in Western Kang continues to arrive. As of the end of January, the city of Baoxing County was still in the hands of the "People's Self-Defense Army." The city was captured by the militia last winter and changed hands twice after Chiang's troops "suppressed" it. The Lushan militia captured the county seat twice, on January 4th and 21st. Currently, they are fighting Chiang's troops at Luojia Mountain, 20 miles from the city. The suburbs of Tianquan, Rongjing, and Ya'an counties are also controlled by the militia. In the Ningyuan area, 36,000 Yi people (the Chongqing National Gazette of December 23rd claimed nearly 100,000) under the command of Commander Ahelumu are bravely resisting Chiang's troops' second "suppression" in the Ligu area of Puxiong. Chiang's troops have launched three attacks, and the Yi residents of Xinjigou Village alone have been bombed twice, resulting in numerous casualties. The Yi people's resistance has become even more resolute. Chiang's troops' first "suppression" began last winter. The "suppression" army, supported by five aircraft, engaged in fierce battles with the Yi army in Wulijian, Hengliangzi, and other places, with Chiang's troops suffering hundreds of casualties. Subsequently, the main force of the Yi army dispersed and constantly attacked behind Chiang's troops, seriously threatening their supplies. By the end of December, Chiang's first "suppression" had failed. In January, the Xichang Garrison Headquarters demanded that the Yi people "surrender their weapons," which was sternly rejected.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: According to the Kuomintang's Chengdu Huaxi Daily, the armed uprising of Qu Bogai Shao in the border areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei has grown to 5,000 people. In January, the armed forces formed by the Yi people of Mabian County in southwestern Sichuan, led by Bi Xingfa and others, launched a self-defensive counterattack against the fourth squadron of the fifth administrative district police of Chiang's government, killing and capturing 19 officers and soldiers, including the Chiang's party squadron leader He Ruyan, and seizing two machine guns and more than 20 rifles and pistols. Recently, in the Leshan and Emei areas, a militia of over a hundred people, led by a certain female leader, has emerged and once attacked Xiting Town west of Leshan, and is now active along the Lexi Highway. In the southern Sichuan counties of Longchang and Neijiang, and the northern Sichuan county of Nanbu, the army and people have recently been active in all directions.
