Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 18th: Moscow dispatch: On the 17th, the Allied Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference continued to discuss the military terms of the Austrian peace treaty. The foreign ministers' assistants reached an agreement on several issues, especially regarding the number of airports within Austrian territory. The treaty will specifically stipulate that the number of airports should strictly correspond to the tasks of the air force and civil aviation transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 19th: Moscow dispatch: On the 18th, the Allied Foreign Ministers' Assistants continued to discuss the political terms of the Austrian peace treaty. At the London Conference, the foreign ministers' assistants agreed that the following provisions must be included in the treaty: prohibiting any kind of political or economic union between Germany and Austria; and preventing the revival and activities of organizations whose purpose is to conclude political or economic alliances with Germany, to conduct propaganda favorable to the alliance, and any form of pan-German propaganda. In the discussion on the 17th, US representative Clark opposed prohibiting any form of pan-German propaganda, claiming that he would propose a different plan. Soviet representative Gusev disagreed with Clark's opinion, pointing out that any pan-German propaganda is dangerous. During the London discussions on this proposal, the British representative had agreed on the necessity of prohibiting any form of pan-German propaganda. However, on the 17th, Hood changed his opinion, supporting the US representative's decision to submit this issue to the Council of Foreign Ministers for resolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 20th: Moscow dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Assistants handling the Austrian issue continued to discuss the political terms of the Austrian peace treaty on the 19th, under the chairmanship of British representative Hood. The assistants studied the clause on "the transfer of Germans in Austria to Austrian nationality." US representative Clark opposed the Soviet proposal to deprive Germans residing in Austria of their rights. The Soviet Union suggested this because Germans in Austria played a considerable role in preparing for the German-Austrian annexation. Soviet representative Gusev reiterated that the clause under discussion was directly related to the issue of maintaining Austrian independence, and it was also related to the refugee problem and had significant political implications. At the chairman's suggestion, further discussion of this clause was postponed until after the refugee problem was discussed. The representatives then proceeded to discuss the special regulations and laws on clearing the remnants of the fascist system and restoring the democratic system.
