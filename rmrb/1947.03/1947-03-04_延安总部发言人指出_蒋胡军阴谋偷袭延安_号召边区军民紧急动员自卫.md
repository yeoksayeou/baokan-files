　　Yan'an Headquarters Spokesperson Points Out
    Jiang-Hu Troops Plot to Raid Yan'an
    Calls on Border Region Military and Civilians to Immediately Mobilize for Self-Defense
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] The Yan'an Headquarters spokesperson pointed out to reporters today that Hu Zongnan is orchestrating a major military plot, namely concentrating forces to seize Yan'an. The main force of the Hu army, the reorganized First Division and the reorganized Ninetieth Division, are crossing the Yellow River westward and concentrating in the Yichuan area, which is the main force for attacking Yan'an. Hu's army's attack on Qingyang is actually a feint, with the aim of attracting our army westward, so that its main force can take advantage of the situation to launch a surprise attack on Yan'an. This military plot of Hu Zongnan is closely coordinated with Chiang Kai-shek's military plot to persecute the CCP representatives and liaison personnel stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. The spokesperson warned: "This attack is likely to be launched on March 6th. After being exposed, it may be brought forward or postponed. The Chiang side's so-called escort of CCP liaison personnel to Yan'an is intended to "escort" them to Yan'an occupied by the Chiang army. In other words, it is to persecute them." The spokesperson called on all military and civilians to mobilize urgently to smash Hu Zongnan's sudden attack on Yan'an.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] "Thoroughly smashing Hu Zongnan's offensive against the border region is the best congratulatory gift to celebrate the victory in Central Shandong!" This was the call of Chairman Lin Boqu at the Bianfu celebration meeting for the victory in Central Shandong the day before yesterday. Shen Bochun, former speaker of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Senate, said in his speech: "This great victory of annihilating 50,000 enemies only took 60 hours, which proves that Chiang Kai-shek's civil war power has become surprisingly weak." Mr. Li Furen, one of the responsible persons of the Northwest China Democratic League, said, "Smashing Hu Zongnan's attack and achieving greater victories must rely on everyone's efforts to achieve." Finally, there was an evening party to add to the fun.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] The People's Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Qingyang, the capital of the Longdong sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, at 5 pm yesterday (the 1st). The invaders were the 24th Brigade of the 76th Division of the Jiang-Hu army.
    Also, it is reported: Meng, where the Zhenyuan County government is located, was occupied by the Jiang-Hu army on the 28th of last month.

　　延安总部发言人指出
    蒋胡军阴谋偷袭延安
    号召边区军民紧急动员自卫
    【新华社延安二日电】延安总部发言人今日对记者指出胡宗南正在布置一个重大的军事阴谋，即集中兵力袭取延安。胡军主力整第一师与整第九十师在西渡黄河，正在集中宜川地区，此为进攻延安的主力。胡军进攻庆阳实乃一佯攻性质，其目的在吸引我军西向，以便其主力乘虚突袭延安。胡宗南的这一军事阴谋，与蒋介石企图迫害留驻京沪渝中共代表及联络人员的军事阴谋是密切配合的。发言人警告说：“这个袭击很可能在三月六日发动，在被揭露后可能提早或推迟，蒋方人员所谓蒋中共联络人员护送到延安，其意图是想把他们“护送”到蒋军占领的延安。换一句话说，就是迫害他们。发言人号召全体军民紧张动员起来，粉碎胡宗南对延安的突然袭击。
    【新华社延安二日电】“彻底粉碎胡宗南对边区的进攻，是庆祝鲁中大捷的最好贺礼！”这是林伯渠主席在前天边府庆祝鲁中大捷大会上的号召。前晋冀鲁豫边区参议长申伯纯讲话中称：“此次歼敌五万的大捷，一共只打了六十个钟头，这证明蒋介石内战力量已经脆弱到可惊程度了。”西北民盟负责人之一的李敷仁先生称“粉碎胡宗南进攻，取得更大的胜利，必须靠大家努力争取才能获得。”最后并有晚会助兴。
    【新华社延安二日电】人民解放军于昨日（一日）下午五时主动撤离陕甘宁边区陇东分区首府庆阳，侵占该地者为蒋胡军第七十六师之第二十四旅。
    又讯：镇原县府所在地孟于上月二十八日为蒋胡军侵占。
