    奸淫掳掠无恶不作
    【新华社晋察冀二十四日电】蒋军奸淫掳掠等暴行，其内部文件已予招认。蒋记十一战区司令长官部相智字第六三三四号代电中称：“据报由津至保民商利用铁道运送商品时，屡有不肖官兵中途劫夺情事，商民最近损失达五千万元之巨等情……”。第三军参通字第一七四号代电开：“接孙长官（按：即孙连仲）据报冀东国军途经宝坻辛渠镇时，沿途时有借机抢掠、并有奸淫良家妇女者，所以国军所到妇女恐慌异常，逃避一空”。又参战字五一零一号代电开：“据报各县地方保安团队及地方武装每多吃缺派款，……并假剿匪之名行抢掠之实，指农民牲畜为战用品而行没收，以致民众痛苦万分，怨声载道”。十六军五一一六号代电开：“据报此次冀东我部队每有强认布店中存布为匪布者”。上述同类性质之文件甚多，均于解放望都、定县时为人民解放军所缴获。
