    Lingchuan Cadres Plan Land Reclamation
    Zhangbin Middle School Spins and Weaves
    [Reported by our newspaper] The Taihang production and frugality campaign continues to be widely carried out in various government organs and schools. After the Lingchuan Expansion Cadre Conference discussed the campaign to perform meritorious service for the people, 160 cadres became involved in the production and frugality movement. The cadres saved a total of 7,094 catties of rice, 234 pairs of shoes, 78,500 yuan, and 539 square feet of cloth, all of which were handed over to the public to support the front lines. In addition, they also guaranteed to reclaim 315 mu of land, spin 269 catties of cotton, and hand in 6,630 catties of vegetables to the public. Under the slogan of "Everything for supporting the front lines," all the cadres of the Second District Office of She County unanimously decided to save one month's worth of grain, totaling 1,000 catties of rice, to supply the front lines. This amount was compensated for by reducing their living standards. Currently, the cadres in the district have reduced their consumption of noodles from once a day to once every four days, planted 2.4 mu of flat land, and opened up small plots of river land to grow tobacco and rice to solve the problem of year-round vegetables and office expenses. The Taihang Postal Administration, vocational school female cadres and family members held a symposium on "March 8th" International Women's Day and decided to work hard on spinning and weaving. Female cadres and family members of the Xinhua Bookstore also recently discussed production and establishing household management. Comrade Zhou Zhiqi, in addition to completing her personal production tasks, also wants to establish a household reserve of 200 catties of rice. Family members have also actively made spinning and weaving and shoe-making plans. Sister-in-law Shi has already spun four catties of cotton in the first ten days, and she will weave cloth herself later. After the ideological mobilization of the "March 8th" symposium, all the employees, family members, and female cadres of the Second Factory of the Yongxing Printing Bureau are in high spirits for production and frugality. They are now ordering spinning wheels separately. The Wanxing Branch of the Second Sub-district of the Taihang Trading Company used to spend 24,000 yuan on cigarettes every month. Now, all 20-odd employees in the store have made a dry tobacco pipe each and quit smoking cigarettes, which will save more than 240,000 yuan annually. The entire store also collectively planted a seven-fen vegetable garden, and from April onwards, they will be self-sufficient in vegetables, which can save 30,000 yuan in vegetable expenses per month. After Principal Li took the lead in setting personal production and frugality plans, Zhangbin Middle School overcame the past phenomena of simply relying on the public and being afraid of labor. Now, the student cooperative is actively leading students in production. It already has six knitting machines, towel machines, weaving machines, and cotton ginning bows each, and more than seventy spinning wheels are all in operation. It is estimated that the living problems of more than one hundred self-funded students this year can be completely solved through production.

    陵川干部计划开荒
    漳滨中学纺花织布
    【本报综合消息】太行生产节约运动继续在各机关学校普遍开展中。陵川扩干会讨论为民立功运动后，一百六十个干部卷入生产节约运动。干部节约米共七千零九十四斤，鞋二百三十四双，钱七万八千五百元，布五百三十九方尺，全部交公支援前线。此外并保证开荒地三百十五亩，纺花二百六十九斤，交公蔬菜六千六百三十斤。涉县二区区公所在“一切为了支援前线”口号下，全体干部一致决定节约一月粮食计一千斤米供给前线，此数由降低生活抵补。现该区干部已由一天一顿面减到四天一顿面，种平地二亩四分，并开小块河地种烟叶稻子等解决全年蔬菜与办公费。太行邮政管理局、职业学校妇女干部及家属，于“三八”节举行座谈会，决定努力纺织。新华书店妇女干部与家属亦于最近讨论生产与建立家务问题，周之奇同志除完成个人生产任务外，还要建立二百斤米的家务。各家属亦纷纷订出纺织做鞋计划。史大嫂在前十天内已经纺了四斤花，她以后还要自己织布。永兴印刷局第二厂全体职工家属及女干部，经“三八”座谈会思想动员后，生产节约情绪很高，现在分别订购纺车。太行贸易公司二分区万兴号一分店过去每月纸烟开销两万四千元，现全店二十余人皆制旱烟袋一支，戒吸纸烟，全年将节约二十四万元以上。全店并集体种菜园七分，从四月份起将做到吃菜自给，每月可节省菜金三万元。漳滨中学经李校长带头订出个人生产节约计划后，克服过去单纯依靠公家及怕劳动等现象。现学生合作社积极领导同学生产，已有织袜机六部，毛巾机、织布机、弹花弓各一部，纺车七十余辆全部开工，预计今年百余自费生的生活问题可以全部生产解决。
