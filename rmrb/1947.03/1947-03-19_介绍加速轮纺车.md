　　Introducing the Accelerated Wheel Spinning Wheel

　　The accelerated wheel spinning wheel is a creation of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Its structure is very simple: it adds two wheels, one large and one small, between the crank wheel and the spindle of the old-style spinning wheel (the large wheel is three inches in diameter, and the small wheel is one inch; the two wheels are fixed on the same axle). The string of the small wheel is connected to the crank wheel, and the string of the large wheel is connected to the spindle (as shown in the figure). The rotation of the crank wheel drives the small wheel, and the large wheel rotates with the small wheel. The string of the large wheel drives the spindle. Because the diameter of the large wheel is three times that of the small wheel, the spindle can rotate three times faster with the same rotation of the crank wheel.

　　The old spinning wheel required three to five turns for each thread, and the thread had to be pulled very slowly, wasting time on the crank wheel. However, this spinning wheel only requires two or one and a half turns. The right hand slowly cranks, and the left hand can pull the thread as quickly as possible. With practice, the output will naturally increase.

　　Based on the available materials, we believe that this spinning wheel has development prospects because it has these advantages: (1) It is indeed much faster than the old spinning wheel (more than one-half faster). (2) It is simple and inexpensive to make, simply lengthen the crossbar of the wheel seat (four or five inches) and add two wheels to the bar. (3) It is easy to learn, and it becomes much faster with practice. (4) Because the degree of sheltering is large, the spun thread is of good quality.

　　介绍加速轮纺车
    加速轮纺车是陕甘宁边区的创造，构造很简单，就是在旧式纺车的摇轮与锭子之间加上大小两个轮子（大轮直径三寸，小轮一寸，两轮固定在同一轴上，），小轮的弦连到摇轮上，大轮的弦连到锭子上（如图），摇轮转动带动小轮，大轮随小轮转，大轮的弦带动锭子，因为大轮比小轮直径大三倍，所以摇轮同样旋转，锭子可以快三倍。
    旧纺车每一条线要摇三至五周，线要拉的很慢，时间都耽误在摇轮上面了。可是这种纺车只摇两周或周半就行。右手慢慢地摇，左手可以尽快的拉线，熟练后产量自然是会提高的。
    根据现有材料，我们认为这种纺车是有发展前途的，因为它具有这几个优点：（一）的确比旧纺车快许多（快二分之一以上）。（二）制起来简易省钱，把车座横档加长一些（四五寸），在档上加上两个轮子即可。（三）容易学会，熟练后就快多了。（四）因为摭度大，纺出来的线好。
