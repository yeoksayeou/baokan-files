Half-Month Battle Situation in Our Area from February 16th to 28th
	Enemy on Longhai Line Forced to Disperse, Our Troops in Yuwan and Su Advance Southward
	Chiang Troops in Northern Henan are Empty, Enemy in Southern Shanxi Crosses Westward with Weak Defense

	In the second half of February, there were no major campaign activities on any of the battlefields in our area. In the Jiluyu area, under the prestige of our army's return to the Longhai Line in early February, threatening Xuzhou and Bianliang, Chiang Kai-shek's predetermined plan to concentrate the main force of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters to reinforce the Lunan battlefield was shattered, and he was forced to adopt an offensive defense, launching attacks on both sides of the Longhai Line. Starting on February 13th, first, eight brigades under the unified command of Wang Jingjiu launched a counterattack against our army north of the Longhai Line in two columns. The left column (all of the 85th Division and two brigades of the 72nd Division), commanded by Wu Shaozhu, moved north from Minquan along the line of Cao County, Dingtao, Heze, and various cities. The right column (all of the 5th Army and one brigade of the 75th Division), directly commanded by Wang Jingjiu, moved north from Mamuji Station east of Shangqiu along the line of Shan County, Chengwu, Juye, Jiaxiang, and Yuncheng, attempting to pressure our army to the north bank of the old Yellow River, firmly control the southwestern Shandong area, cut off the connection between Jijinyu and Lunan, and lift our army's threat to the Longhai Line. Our army retreated steadily with small units, successively abandoning eight county towns (at present, our entire area still controls ten newly recovered county towns), forcing Chiang Kai-shek's already concentrated forces to be redistributed, burdened with baggage, and plunged into the fire of our guerrilla warfare, facing the danger of being suddenly annihilated by our army anytime and anywhere.

	At the same time, on the Yuwansu battlefield south of the Longhai Railway, the 174th and 176th brigades of Chiang's 48th Division (formerly stationed in Anqing, transferred to Bengbu in early February), the New 15th Brigade of the 72nd Division (formerly stationed in Shaanxi), the New 10th Brigade of the 58th Division (near Yongcheng), and the 64th Brigade of the 15th Division (formerly stationed east of Kaifeng) were attacking our army from the east, west, and north directions to lift our army's threat to the south side of the Longhai Line and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and reoccupying our Luyi, Zhecheng, Hao County, and Taikang cities. Our army used decentralized guerrilla activities to strike the attacking enemy everywhere. On the 18th, a part of our army repelled the attack of more than 2,000 people from the New 10th Brigade's 29th Regiment and the Yongcheng Security Regiment in Xu Anlou and Ding Lukou south of Xiayi, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 120 enemies, which is one example. At the same time, a part of the main force advanced southward, penetrating deep into the Yellow River flooded area, capturing the Qiuqu stronghold southeast of Huaiyang, and liberating the Shen (Qiu), Lu (Yi), and Huai (Yang) triangular area. In short, Chiang's mobile forces, about thirteen brigades, have been detained by our army north and south of the Longhai Line, and cannot add these forces to the Lunan battlefield according to Chiang Kai-shek's predetermined plan of "key pointism"; Chiang Kai-shek's strategic intention has once again been shattered by our army.

	In northern Henan, since the main force of Chiang's army, the 85th Division and the Rapid Second Column (i.e., the 49th Brigade), were transferred south, the defense has been extremely empty. Our army's western attack on Hebi (west of Tangyin) and eastern attack on Chuwang (southeast of Anyang) have put the 32nd and 40th Divisions in a state of being beaten everywhere and reinforcing everywhere, exhausted. Tang Yongliang, commander of the 32nd Division, was almost captured in the battle outside Hebi (three of his guards have been captured). When he retreated to Tangyin, he was completely defeated. Wang Zhonglian was trapped in Xinxiang and had to use transport regiments to take on city defense, at a loss and in a state of embarrassment. Now, in order to save this critical situation, Chiang's army has transferred the Rapid Second Column back to Xinxiang from the Minquan area to strengthen the defense.

	In southern Shanxi, because Hu Zongnan is actively deploying to attack Yan'an, all of the First Division, all of the 90th Division, and about seven brigades of the 47th Brigade of the 27th Division and the 12th Brigade of the 17th Division are crossing the Yellow River one after another, or are gathering in Jishan, Hejin, Daning and other places to prepare to cross the river. The thirty county towns in the Chiang-Yan occupied areas of southern and western Shanxi are only guarded by all of the 30th Division, one and a half brigades of the 38th Division, one brigade of the 27th Division (a total of about eleven regiments), and local teams, completely exposed to our army's strikes at any time. On the 13th, our local troops in Taiyue captured two strongholds, Yaotou and Wangyukou, in the area south of Xia County and northeast of Pingmu. On the 25th, they annihilated a part of the Yan army near Hedi Village north of Huo County (preliminary results: more than 900 enemies were killed and captured, and six heavy machine guns, more than ten light machine guns, and three small cannons were seized). In the future, the Chiang-Yan army will continue to suffer greater blows from us.

　　二月十六日至二十八日
    本区半月战况
    陇海线敌被迫分散豫皖苏我军南进
    豫北蒋军空虚晋南敌西渡守备亦弱
    军区司令部
    二月下半月，本区各个战场上，均无大的战役活动。冀鲁豫方面，在我军二月初重临陇海线、威胁徐汴的声威之下，蒋介石集中郑州绥署主力增强鲁南战场的预定计划便告破产，被迫采取攻势防御，向陇海两侧进攻。二月十三日起，首先以王敬久统一指挥下的八个旅，分两纵队向陇海以北我军举行反扑，其左纵队（八十五师全部，七十二师两个旅）由吴绍蜀指挥，自民权出动沿曹县、定陶、荷泽、各城之线北犯，右纵队（五军全部及七十五师一个旅）由王敬久直接指挥，自商邱以东之马牧集车站出动，沿单县、城武、巨野、嘉祥、郓城之线北犯，企图压迫我军至旧黄河北岸，确掌鲁西南地区，切断冀晋豫与鲁南的连系，解除我军对陇海线的威胁。我军则以小部队节节抗退，连续放弃八座县城（现全区我尚控制新收复县城十座），使蒋介石已经集中起来的兵力，被迫重新分散，背起包袱，陷入我游击战争的火海，而面临随时随地被我军突然歼灭的危险。
    与此同时，在陇海路以南的豫皖苏战场上，蒋军四十八师一七四、一七六两旅（原驻安庆，二月初调蚌埠）、七十二师新十五旅（原驻陕西）、五十八师新十旅（永城附近）及十五师六十四旅（原驻开封以东）正为解除我军对陇海南侧及津浦线的威胁而从东、西、北三方向向我军进攻，再占我鹿邑、柘城、毫县、太康等城。我军则以分散的游击活动，到处予进攻之敌以打击；十八日我军一部在夏邑以南之徐暗楼及丁路口击退新第十旅二十九团及永城保安团等两千余人之进攻，毙伤俘敌一百二十余名，即其一例。同时，更以主力一部，向南挺进，深入黄泛区，攻克淮阳东南之秋渠据点，解放沈（邱）、鹿（邑）、淮（阳）三角地区。总之，蒋军机动兵力约十三个旅已为我军抑留于陇海线南北，而不能按照蒋介石“重点主义”的预定计划，把这些兵力加到鲁南战场去；蒋介石的战略意图，又一次为我军所粉碎。
    豫北方面，自蒋军主力八十五师、快速第二纵队（即四十九旅）南调之后，守备已异常空虚；我军西攻鹤壁（汤阴以西），东攻楚旺（安阳东南），已使其三十二师、四十师两部，陷入处处挨打、处处增援、疲于奔命的状态，三十二师师长唐永良在鹤壁外围战斗中几乎被俘（其卫士三人已被俘），退回汤阴时，溃不成军。王仲廉困守新乡，只好用输送团来担任城防，手足无措，窘态毕露。现蒋军为挽救这一危局，已调快速第二纵队由民权一带返回新乡，增强守备。
    晋南方面，由于胡宗南正积极布置进攻延安，第一师全部、第九十师全部及二十七师之四十七旅，十七师之十二旅等共约七个旅兵力，正先后西渡黄河，或正集结稷山、河津、大宁等地准备渡河；晋南、晋西蒋占区三十个县城，仅由三十师全部、三十八师一个半旅、二十七师一个旅（共约十一个团的兵力）及地方团队驻守，完全暴露于我军的随时打击之下。太岳我地方部队于十三日在夏县以南、平睦东北地区攻克窑头、王峪口等据点两处，二十五日又在霍县以北之河底村附近歼灭阎军一部（初步战果：毙俘九百余人，缴获机枪六挺，轻机枪十余挺、小炮三门），今后蒋阎军将继续遭我更大的打击。
