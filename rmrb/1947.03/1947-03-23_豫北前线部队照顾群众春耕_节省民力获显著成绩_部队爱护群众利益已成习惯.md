    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Comrade Wang Minzhao from the Yubei Front reports: The education and activities of the troops on the Yubei Front in supporting the government and cherishing the people have been integrated into the regular life of the troops. After the last battle west of the Pinghan Railway concluded, the troops immediately worked with local authorities to inspect the mass discipline in the battle areas, reviewing all materials within the troops for education and practical purposes. Problems requiring compensation or resolution were handled by designated personnel in conjunction with local governments. In areas where troops were stationed or passing through, people were sent to solicit opinions from local residents and the masses. For example, after the troops participated in the Tangyin campaign, fighting continuously for seven days and nights, they were extremely exhausted. Upon arriving at their stationing area, due to darkness and cold, some individuals did not sufficiently observe discipline or treat the masses well. The next morning, the Political Department of the Front immediately dispatched personnel to the district office to convene a meeting of village chiefs from the villages where the troops were stationed, soliciting opinions about the troops and recording specific facts for prompt handling by relevant units. Simultaneously, they explained the course and gains of the campaign to the village chiefs. During the meeting, the village chiefs reflected that "the troops are working so hard at the front, we are not taking good enough care of them." Some even said, "We have also been out and participated in battles; one person has difficulties when going out, and such a large force has even more difficulties. We should help them well." The troops then launched a "three no-leave" movement to implement good mass discipline, that is, not leaving until the ground is cleaned, not leaving until borrowed items are returned, and not leaving until water jars are filled. All units did very well. As spring arrived and wheat seedlings began to grow, the troops not only proposed a ban on walking on wheat fields but also helped the masses build weirs to block roads and mobilized army livestock to deliver manure to the villagers. To increase production for the masses, the troops made every effort to save civilian labor, with some service units undertaking tasks entirely on their own. For example, during each march and transfer, the "Hanyang" unit's "Wangjiapo" bridging planks, ladders, hand grenades, ammunition, electrical wires, and other combat equipment were previously carried by civilian laborers. In recent marches, to save civilian labor, the troops carried these items themselves, saving 200 civilian laborers each day. Soldiers competed to carry more, saying, "We are also common people at home; revolution is for the people." When a special company of a certain unit was marching, Wang Guilin developed sores on his feet. Platoon Leader Gong Sanxiao said, "What do we do if Wang Guilin can't walk?" He asked everyone to think of a solution. Zhang Sandai said, "Let's carry him." This moved everyone, and they said, "Let's find a stretcher." Zhang Sandai, Wang Youxi, Cheng Yanming, Wang Tisheng, and Yue Sicheng took turns carrying him to the destination. Along the way, the villagers saw this and said, "The Eighth Route Army not only sheds blood for the people at the front but also sweats for the people, saving civilian labor." In responding to and implementing the "three no-leave" movement, due to the masses' enthusiastic creativity, many new developments have emerged in mass discipline. Hao Bingchen and Wang Sanxin of the machine gun squad in "Fanjiapo" initiated the idea of cleaning out the outhouses for the masses before leaving. The two of them cleaned out a pit of manure completely, delivering it to the villagers' fields. The landlord, an old man, was moved and said, "I am sixty years old, and I have never seen troops clean outhouses for the common people. When the Central Army was here, let alone cleaning, they defecated everywhere on the streets and in the courtyards. It stank in the summer, and no one cared." Three days after the troops in "Fanjiapo" transferred, villages sent letters seeking the troops' opinions on their stay. A letter from Fujia Donggou Village in Lin County said, "The discipline of your First Battalion stationed in our village was very good. After you left, every household checked and did not find a single needle or thread missing. Not a single dried persimmon hanging on Fu Jinfu's wall was missing, and not a single Jicha banknote was missing from the roll left in the landlord's house where the Third Squad was stationed. You also helped the landlord with production, carrying water, weeding, sweeping the courtyard, and accumulating fertilizer. Before leaving, you put the straw, door panels, where you took them, not messing anything up. When you left, you carried your own bombs and grain, even carrying the sick themselves, which was truly wonderful. We did not help you very well, we hope you will send a letter and give us some advice to help us improve." After receiving the letter, the First Battalion immediately wrote a letter thanking the villagers for their care and conducted a special introspection to do even better in the future.

    [Another Dispatch] On the afternoon of March 1st, the First Battalion of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments was stationed in Qianjiagang. The Sixth Company had just arrived at their encampment and had not yet entered the village. Suddenly, a little girl ran from the direction of Xiaoxinzhuang, shouting repeatedly, "Fire! Fire!" It turned out that the little girl, from villager Liu Yonggui's family in Xiaoxinzhuang, had been careless while cooking and boiling water, and the fire had shot out of the chimney, igniting the haystack behind the house and spreading to the thatched house of his eldest child. It happened that the wind was strong, and the wind fueled the fire, which grew larger and larger. There was only an old woman at home, and there was no way to put it out, so she sent the little girl to find the Eighth Route Army. As soon as Company Commander He Maolin heard this, he immediately sent Platoon Leaders Zhang Leyi and Pang Yongyao with a platoon to rush to the fire like a charge. After running half a mile, they arrived at the scene of the fire, where the fire was already burning on all sides, with flames raging. The comrades of the Sixth Company bravely built human ladders to climb onto the roof, knocking down the beams that were on fire. Some poured water on the fire, some covered the fire with soil, and some covered the fire with blankets. Several comrades jumped into the fire to put it out, disregarding the danger. Platoon Leader Zhang Leyi burned his own cotton coat, and many comrades got their lower bodies wet from pouring water. After more than ten minutes of valiant rescue, the fire was finally extinguished. Afterwards, the masses thanked them, saying, "Thanks to the comrades for putting out the fire, otherwise the whole village would have been burned down." The village cadres also repeatedly thanked them, saying, "There are only a dozen households in our village, and there are not many men to begin with. It just so happened that everyone went to the market or production, and some went to training. There was no one in the village to put out the fire. If it weren't for the comrades coming to the rescue, all the houses in the village would not have been safe."

    豫北前线部队照顾群众春耕
    节省民力获显著成绩
    部队爱护群众利益已成习惯
    【本报特讯】豫北前线王敏昭同志报导：豫北前线部队拥政爱民的教育与活动，已贯穿于部队的经常生活中。上次平汉路西战役结束，部队即协同地方检查作战地区的群众纪律，将所有材料在部队进行检讨与实际教育，需要赔偿与处理的问题，即派专人前往会同地方政府处理。部队驻军及经过之地区，都派人向地方及群众征求意见。如前次部队参加汤阴战役连续作战七天七夜后十分疲劳，到达驻地时因天黑寒冷，个别人员对纪律遵守不够及对群众态度不好，前线政治部次日晨即派专人到区公所召集军队驻村各村长会议，征求对军队的意见，并录下具体事实转交各有关部队迅即处理；同时向各村长讲述此次战役经过与收获。会议中各村村长都反映：“军队在前方这样辛苦，我们招呼十分不够”。有的还说：“我们也出过门，参过战，一个人出门都有困难，这样大部队困难更多，我们应该好好帮助。”部队旋即发起执行良好群众纪律的“三不走”运动，即地不扫干净不走，借东西不还清楚不走，水不满缸不走。各个部队都做得很好。春天到来麦苗已开始生长，部队不但提出禁走麦地，还帮助群众垒堰断路，并动员军队牲口给老乡送粪，为使群众增加生产，部队极力节省民力，有些勤务部队完全自力担任。如每次行军转移时，“汉阳”部“王家坡”的跳板、梯子、手榴弹、弹药、电线等作战器材，以前都是由民夫担抬，在最近的行军中，为节省民力由部队自己担带，每日即节省民力二百个，战士们都争着愿多担些，他们说：“咱在家也是老百姓，革命就是为人民。”某部特务连行军时，王贵林脚上长了疮，排长弓三小说：“王贵林不能走怎么办？”叫大家想办法，张三贷说：“咱背他”。这激动了大家都说：“找担架抬吧”，张三贷、王有喜、程彦明、王体生、岳四成五人轮流抬到目的地。一路上老乡见了都说：“八路军不仅为人民在前线流血，也在为人民流汗，节省民力。”各部队在响应执行“三不走”的运动中，由于群众的热情创造，在群众纪律上并且有了许多新的发挥。“范家坡”机枪班郝炳辰和王三信发动临走时替群众挖净毛厕，两个人就把一坑粪挖的干干净净，带老乡送到地里去。房东老汉感动的说：“我六十岁了，没见过军队给老百姓挖毛厕的。中央军在时，不说挖吧，满街满院到处拉屎，夏天臭的不能在，谁管呢。”“范家坡”部队转移后第三天，各村纷纷来信征求部队对驻村意见。林县傅家东沟村来信说：“你们一营驻我村纪律很好，走后家家检查没掉一针一线。傅金伏家墙上挂的柿干一个也不少，三小队驻的房东家放的一卷冀钞一张也不缺。你们还帮助房东生产、担水、锄草、扫院、积肥。临走时铺草，门板，那里取那里放，一点不乱。走时自己担炸弹，背粮食，连病号也自己抬，真是太好了。我们对你们帮助不很好，望来信提些意见，帮助我们进步。”一营接信后，马上写一封信感谢老乡们的爱护，并专门进行一次反省检查，要今后搞的更好些。
    【又讯】三月一日下午，四五部队一营驻防千家岗，六连刚到宿营地还没进村。忽然从小辛庄方向跑来一个小女孩，连连叫唤“救火呀，救火呀！”原来小辛庄老乡刘永贵的小女孩，因做饭烧水不小心，火冒出烟筒，烧着房后草垛，延烧到他大孩的草房，恰巧天刮大风，风助火势越烧越大。家里只有一个老婆子，没有办法，才叫小女孩来找八路军。和茂林连长一听，马上派张乐义、庞勇耀排长带一个排像冲锋一样的赶去救火，跑了半里地赶到起火地点时，大火已四面燃起，火舌乱窜。六连同志马上勇敢的搭人梯爬上了房檐，把火烧着的梁打下去，有的用水泼火，有的用土盖火，还有的用被蒙火，好几个同志不顾危险跳在火中救火。张乐义排长把自己棉袄也烧坏了，很多同志浇水把下半身都弄湿了。经过这样点把钟奋勇抢救，大火终于被扑熄了。事后群众感谢的说：“多亏同志们救火呀，不然全村房屋要给烧光了”。村干部也连声道谢说：“我们这村一共才十几户人家，男人本来就不多，又碰巧大家都去赶集、生产，还有的受训去，村里就没有人救火，要不是同志们来救，全村房子都不保险”。
