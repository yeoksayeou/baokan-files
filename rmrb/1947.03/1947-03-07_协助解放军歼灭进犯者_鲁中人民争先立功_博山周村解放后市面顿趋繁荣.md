　　Assisting the PLA to Annihilate the Invaders
    The People of Central Shandong Compete to Perform Meritorious Deeds
    Market in Boshan and Zhoucun Quickly Prosper After Liberation

    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 5th: This reporter, Zhuang Zhong, reports that in the battle where the five million people of the Central Shandong Liberated Area assisted the People's Liberation Army in annihilating seven divisions of Chiang's troops in the Laiwu area, they competed to perform meritorious deeds. In the past ten days, this reporter has witnessed countless heroic deeds of the people in the Yimeng Mountain area. Over 400,000 soldiers and civilians successively went to the front, singing and laughing while discussing their individual plans to perform meritorious deeds. Among the four militia regiments participating in the war in Yibei County (north of Yishui), the Chen Xueyu Demolition Team alone successively detonated and killed over 300 invading Chiang soldiers on the front lines of Boshan, Laiwu, and Xintai. In Limianzi, 120 households automatically made 1,850 jin of pancakes and white flour cakes, milled 2,800 jin of millet and 1,800 jin of wheat flour, and collected 6,000 jin of firewood, all of which were transported to the front in a single day on the 15th. The masses said: "Central Shandong had a bumper harvest last year. We'll feed our army well so they can fight the reactionaries!" Women and children were important forces in this logistics army. In addition to standing guard and keeping watch, the children also led the army and delivered supplies. The women near the Yishui tributaries braved the severe cold to light fires at night to illuminate the river surface, allowing the troops to pass safely. Women from various places crossed mountains and ridges to visit their fathers, sons, husbands, and other relatives in the Liberation Army at the front, bringing them encouragement and strength, and returning home with news of victory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th: On the second day (the 25th) after Zhoucun was liberated again, national flags flew throughout the city, and slogans welcoming the Liberation Army were posted everywhere. The people automatically demolished all of Chiang's army's internal war bunkers. The silk shops and other stores rearranged the goods they had buried and placed them on the shelves. The Dongguan market was crowded with people, a phenomenon that did not exist when Chiang's army occupied the area. With the assistance of the democratic government, the privately-owned electric light company resumed power supply on the same day, and the city's theaters and cinemas resumed normal performances.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th: After Boshan City was liberated again, order was quickly restored. The democratic government has issued a proclamation to reassure the people, canceling the grain and money apportioned by Chiang's puppets, abolishing the conscription system and the baojia system, attracting refugees, protecting industry and commerce, regulating grain, and stabilizing prices. Clear regulations have been made for each item. At present, the democratic governments in the urban area and nearby villages have all been established, most shops have resumed business, and the wounded soldiers and vagrants abandoned by Chiang's army have also been properly resettled.
