Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 6th: After the Democratic Allied Forces recovered the cities of Kailu and Kulun, they nearly recovered Tongliao county town, an important connecting point of the Da(hushan)-Tong(liao) and Liao(yuan)-Bai(yintai Lai—namely Tongxun) railways in Liaobei Province, on the 6th. The results of the battle are currently being verified.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: On the 4th, a unit of the Democratic Allied Forces recovered Huinan county town, more than a hundred kilometers north of Huairen. This is the fourth city to be liberated again in Andong Province, after Ankou, Jinchuan, and Liuhe. Huinan was occupied by the 182nd Division of Chiang's 60th Army on October 14th last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: A unit of the Democratic Allied Forces, active in the Chiang-occupied area of southern Liaoning, fiercely attacked Hedong Village, ten *li* southwest of Huilin Village, Jinping County, on the night of the 2nd. After fierce fighting until dawn on the 3rd, they annihilated one battalion (minus two companies) of the 65th Regiment of the New 22nd Division of Chiang's New 6th Army, as well as two transport companies and one artillery platoon, totaling over 400 men including the battalion commander. They seized six mortars and four heavy machine guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: The main force of Hu Zongnan's 29th Army, the 48th Brigade of the 17th Division, which was attacking Longdong, has been severely attacked by a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army in Xihuachi. Starting at dawn on the 3rd and continuing until the morning of the 5th, the Chiang's troops, despite having two planes to assist them, still suffered over a thousand casualties, and over seven hundred were captured alive. The remnants then fled south. Now, Qingyang and Heshui counties in the Longdong District, as well as Xihuachi town and other places, have all been recovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 6th: Chiang's troops, who invaded the southern part of the Binhai District in several routes in the latter half of last month, have been forced to retreat after being severely attacked by the People's Liberation Army and harassed by guerrillas. Chiang's troops, who invaded north from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, retreated to Xiaodongguan area, about seventy *li* southwest of Ganlong County, on the 1st of this month. Another group of Chiang's troops, who invaded east from the west bank of the Mu River to Qingzhuang (about thirty *li* south of Donghai), also fled to places such as Dashao, west of the river, on the 2nd. Now, there are no enemy traces east of the Mu River, north of the Lin(yi)-Qing(kou) Highway, and in the area south of it.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th: A reporter interviewed Hai Jingqiang, the brigade commander of the 188th Brigade of the 46th Division of Chiang's army captured in the Laiwu campaign, in a certain place on the front line. Hai is 41 years old and is the nephew of Bai Chongxi, the Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Defense. He was wearing a soldier's uniform and had not had food for days before being captured. When the reporter visited him, Hai was having a hearty breakfast. Hai came out of the group of captured soldiers and voluntarily admitted his identity. He told the reporter happily: "I knew long ago that the Communist troops treat prisoners well, so there is no need to hide my true identity." Hai worked in the Gui army in his early years. Speaking of being divided, reorganized, weakened, and forced to fight in the civil war by Chiang Kai-shek, he was extremely indignant. Hai said: "The treatment of our miscellaneous troops is unequal. The direct line troops eat empty salaries, but we don't get any. A few years ago, I was given a demerit, and repeated requests to cancel it were not granted." Speaking of this battle, Hai said: "Chen Cheng is completely incompetent. He ordered his subordinates to go deep into enemy territory alone, surrounded by enemies on all sides, but he deceived himself by saying that the bandit army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) was no longer a military force. He temporarily dragged the troops around, so how could they not be defeated under your (referring to the People's Liberation Army) layers of encirclement and attack?!"
