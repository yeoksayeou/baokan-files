Basic Knowledge of Spinning

Spinning is not difficult to learn. Since the start of personal production in our organization, more than a dozen comrades have already learned it. Of course, doing anything is always a bit troublesome at the beginning, and learning to spin is the same. Here, I will discuss the several stages that beginners inevitably go through:

The first problem encountered is the inability to draw a thread. When the wheel is turned, the thread end carries the cotton roll and the whole thing is pulled away from your hand. If you pull hard, the spindle will "gag, gag" like a duck. This is because beginners start by turning the spinning wheel and then drawing the thread, which twists the thread end on the cotton roll, making the spindle inflexible. If you pull harder, the thread will break! Therefore, at the beginning, pay attention to turning the handle with your right hand, and simultaneously drawing the cotton roll with your left hand to ensure that the thread end is not twisted on the cotton roll. After threading the spindle, leave at least one and a half feet of thread outside the spindle tip, as this will ensure that the thread end does not twist. But if it is "dead", do not pull hard. Stop turning the spinning wheel handle and use your right hand to help turn the thread end back a bit to make it "alive" again before turning the wheel and spinning. This process should not be very long. You can overcome this problem after working through at most three cotton rolls.

The second inevitable trouble is that the drawn thread is uneven in thickness, either as thick as a lamp wick or as thin as a hair – and it often breaks. You have to join the thread twice every three turns of the wheel. Sometimes, as soon as you've joined one section, another section breaks. Thus, the more breaks, the more anxious you become; the more anxious, the easier it is to break. In fact, the root of this problem is uneven thread drawing. To prevent the thread from breaking and to make the thread even, you must: (1) If the thread suddenly becomes thick, turn the wheel slower, draw the thread faster, and pinch the cotton roll between your thumb and forefinger tighter. (2) If the thread suddenly becomes thin, turn the wheel faster, release more cotton roll, and draw slower. Beginners must be calm and patient during this process, and not be flustered or annoyed. "Patience" will help you succeed here. Endure for three days, and you are guaranteed victory!

The third problem encountered is generally still how to make the thread even, and moreover, to make the thread drawn from the cotton roll naturally even. This requires attention to: first, making each cotton roll the same thickness and tightness; if the cotton is machine-carded, you must also see clearly to roll it along the cotton fibers. Second, turning the wheel evenly, and drawing the thread at a consistent speed. Third, holding the cotton roll with your thumb and forefinger with consistent pressure, generally feeling a light and brisk movement at the fingertips is enough. Next is threading. It is easier to thread spindles with "leather washers." For those without "leather washers," if the thread gap is too large, the thread will easily collapse after being drawn. The angle between the drawn thread and the spindle tip should be about thirty-five degrees to prevent collapse.

These are the "troubles" that beginners inevitably encounter when learning to spin. Other skills will "naturally arise with practice," so I won't discuss them here.

### 纺线的基本知识

　　纺线的基本知识
    纺线并不难学。我们机关个人生产开始以来，已有十多位同志学会了。当然，做任何一件事，开始总是要麻烦一些，学纺线也是一样。我这里就把初学纺线者必经的几个过程先谈一下：
    第一着碰到的是抽不出线，一摇车轮，便线头带棉卷，整个儿要从手里拉走，如果硬拽着，锭子就在下面“嘎嘎，嘎”，鸭子似的叫起来。这是由于初学者一开始先摇纺车，然后抽线，把棉卷上的线头扭死了，锭子活动不灵便的缘故，再硬拽，线就断了！所以，开始时，应注意右手摇把手，左手就同时要抽棉卷，要保证线头不在棉卷上扭死；往锭子上线后，使留在锭尖外边的线至少要有一尺五寸左右，因为这样可以保证线头不扭死。但如果“死”了，也不要硬拽，应该停下纺车把手，用右手帮助回一回线头，使其“活”了再摇车轮，再纺。这一步过程不要很长，至多弄完三根棉卷就可克服。
    第二着必经的麻烦是抽出的线子粗细不匀，不是粗的像灯心，便是细的甚于发丝——还常常断了。摇不上三转，总得接两次线；有时接好这一段，另一段又断了。于是，弄得越断越急；越急越易断。其实这一根本毛病，就是抽线不匀。要想使线不断，要使线匀，必须：（一）线突然变粗了，你便使车轮转的慢些，抽线抽的快些，拇指与食指间的棉卷捏的紧些，（二）线突然变细，你就使车轮转快些，棉卷放多些，抽慢些。初学者在这一过程一定要平心静气，不可着慌、恼火。在这里“忍耐”会助你成功。忍过三天，包你胜利！
    第三着遇到的问题一般还是如何使线匀，而且，使线条从棉卷上抽出来就自然是匀的。这就得讲究：一是一根棉卷粗细一样，松紧一样；如果是机器弹的花，卷时还得看清顺着棉纤维卷。二是车轮转的匀，抽线快慢也匀。三是拇指与食指捉住棉卷的松紧也做细匀，一般是指尖感到轻快的弹动就行。其次是上线，锭子上附有“皮钱”的好上，无“皮钱”的，线缝大了，上上去的线容易一抽又垮下来，应使抽出的线条和锭尖成三十五度左右的内角，即可防止垮线。
    初学纺线者必碰到的“麻烦”就是这些。其他“熟中自能生巧”，这里就不谈了。
