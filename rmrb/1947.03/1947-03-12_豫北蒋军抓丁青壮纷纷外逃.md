　　The Kuomintang troops in northern Henan are conscripting young men on a large scale, and the masses are rising up to resist this tyrannical act. Anti-conscription slogans are popular among the masses: "Leave early and come out early, return after dark," "If caught, run back," etc. Zhou Jiazhen, an old man from Chen Village, Xinxiang, had four sons. One was conscripted by the 32nd Army last autumn, and the second was also conscripted after the autumn harvest. The eldest son, fearing trouble at home, fled to Xinxiang Railway Station to do business, but was also conscripted during the New Year. The whole family is left with only the old and the young, unable to make a living. Many young men, in order to avoid conscription, resorted to unfortunate tragedies. One strong man from Yuanzhuang had his wife cut off three of his fingers with a kitchen knife to escape conscription. A mother and her three sons from Fanling, Xinxiang, and two strong men from Fancun, Huojia, fled to the liberated area of Huixian one after another. Our democratic government gave them a warm reception, provided relief, and helped them settle down and resume production. According to the youths who fled: the conscription officials and personnel at the conscription office in Tongmeng Township, Huojia, were making a fortune; at the entrance of the conscription office, there were tragic cries of mothers mourning their sons, wives mourning their husbands, and sons mourning their fathers.
