　　Nan Village Conducts Systematic Ideological Education
    Peasants Improve Armed Self-Awareness
    [Our Newspaper, Lucheng News] Lucheng Fourth District (New District) has seen turned-over peasants, who have undergone a major ideological transformation during the land reform movement. The vast number of peasants have soaring patriotic self-defense enthusiasm. They link their fate with the victory of the Eighth Route Army's patriotic war and demand to join the militia to defend their land. After ideological education, the Nan Village militia has surged to more than 100 people, doubling in size compared to before the land reform. Tenant farmer Shen Ertu used the fact that his ancestors had worked hard and suffered for three generations to illustrate that no matter how hard you worked generation after generation in the old society, you could not get rich. Only the Communist Party liberated Lucheng and everyone turned over. He said, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are even closer than our parents! I want to sign up to carry a gun and become a militiaman to overthrow the old Yan, old Chiang reactionaries." Like him, 52 young men, including Shen Wenzhu, and 12 self-defense team members, awakened from their memories of turning over and poured into the militia. They said, "We cut off the tail of little old Yan. If we don't cut off the root of big old Chiang, we won't be able to protect our fruits." Even many old men actively demanded to join the militia to protect their own interests. (Mang Gou, Xing Fu)
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 5th Dispatch] Changxiang Village in Chengci is a relatively wealthy village, but 21 landlords, accounting for 10% of the village's population, occupied 24% of the land. A total of 117 extremely poor households, accounting for 50% of the village's population, occupied 9.8% of the land. The landlord group headed by Zhang Jun, consisting of 11 large landlords, controlled the village administration and established pro-Japanese armed forces such as the "Guoqing Society" and "Militia," becoming a "model village" during the Japanese occupation. They used Zhang Futai, Li Chengzhang, and others to form black gun teams in the village to suppress the masses. Once, due to attempted rape, they beat to death three members of Lian Pingan's family, and no one dared to say anything. During the vigorous land reform movement, with the help of the turn-over team, the farmers of Changxiang, with unparalleled unity, crushed the rule of the feudal landlords. 458 people poured out their grievances, and 1,421 mu of land, more than 200 houses, 28 donkeys, and more than 100 shi of grain were recovered. The peasants happily said, "The sky is clear!" "The land has returned home!" After the 21 landlords were liquidated, the peasants left them each with 2.8 mu of land. Twenty-two impoverished households were promoted to middle peasants, with an average of 3.5 mu of land per person. Ninety-five poor peasant households also rose to middle peasants, increasing from an average of 0.9 mu to 3.5 mu per person. They also transferred 80 mu of land to poor villages. The farmers in the village are now continuing to rectify their internal affairs and actively preparing for production.

　　南村进行系统思想教育
    农民提高武装自觉
    【本报潞城讯】潞城四区（新区）翻身农民，经过土地改革中思想大翻身运动，广大农民爱国自卫热情昂扬，他们把自己命运和八路军爱国战争胜利联系在一起，纷纷要求参加民兵保卫自己土地。南村民兵于思想教育后激增到一百余人，较土地改革前扩大一倍。雇农申二秃以他祖宗三辈勤劳受苦的事实，说明在旧社会任你怎样辈辈勤劳，也不能发财，只有共产党解放了潞城大家才翻了身。他说：“共产党毛主席比俺爹娘还亲哩！我要报名扛枪当民兵，打倒老阎老蒋反动派。”和他一样从翻身回忆中觉醒的农民申文珠等五十二个年青小伙子和十二个自卫队员，一齐涌入民兵。他们说：“咱割了小老阎的尾巴，不再割掉大老蒋的根，咱的果实也保不住，连许多老汉也积极要求参加保卫自己利益的民兵。（忙狗、兴福）
