　　Breaking Down Re-examination Obstacles
    Wangwu Corrects "Good Enough" Thinking
    Qin County's Emancipated Peasants Gather to Celebrate and Prepare for Re-examination
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 9th] In Wangwu, the "good enough thinking" of cadres has hindered the deepening of the movement during the re-examination process. After the land reform movement in the county was basically completed, the cadres breathed a sigh of relief and developed a "good enough" mentality. Some even said, "Revolutionary work can never be completely finished, so good enough is good enough." In addition, they were busy supporting the front lines and neglected in-depth re-examination, which led to the revival of feudal forces in some villages. For example, the landlord of Huayuangou in the first district even questioned the secretary of the Women's Rescue Association, saying, "On what basis are you struggling against me? Now everyone talks about equality, and I should also be emancipated!" And he demanded the return of thirty mu of land and two buildings. In some villages in the third district, the peasants were still afraid of the landlords and secretly returned the land they had been allocated to the landlords, so that many poor peasants were still unable to be emancipated. In addition, many cadres and activists gained too much fruit and had not yet returned it to the masses, and there were even phenomena of continuing to buy fruit cheaply. This has now attracted the attention of the leadership and is being corrected.
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 9th] After seven months of continuous struggle, land reform in Qin County has been largely completed. On the 22nd of last month, 50,000 emancipated peasants from the entire county gathered in the city to celebrate the return of land to the people. The procession was led by armed militiamen, carrying a large portrait of Chairman Mao, with drums and music filling the air as they entered the venue. Old men and women with shaky teeth and falling hair stepped along, swaying like in a Yangge dance, walking happily. At the crossroads, stood a monument commemorating the emancipation, stipulating February 12th as the Qin County Peasants' Emancipation Day. During this land reform, more than 80,000 people in the county were involved in the movement, going through 5,800 struggles of all sizes. Now, 21,000 landless and land-poor farmers in the county have obtained land, recovering 94,200 mu of land and 23,000 buildings from the landlords, local tyrants, and evil gentry. The vast majority of the poor and landless peasants in the past have laid the foundation for production and prosperity. The main pillars of feudal rule, such as the major traitors Niu Huihan, Wang Bangzheng, Shi Xikui, and Li Shiweng, have been judged by the masses. Big landlords such as Tian Jinquan, Zhou Hanjie, and Wei Anren have also been overthrown and disgraced. The entire rural landscape has been transformed, and the people have obtained true democratic life that they have never had before. For the first time, the workers and peasants have become the masters of society. Many poor old men who could not afford to marry wives in the past have now gotten married. The number of primary school students in the county has increased by more than 6,500, and the more than 4,000 mu of land that was barren under the management of the landlords in the past has been distributed to the peasants for cultivation. In order to cherish this great historical undertaking, the Qin County Peasants' Association has decided to immediately conduct a comprehensive re-examination, to ensure that no peasant is left without land to cultivate, that no peasant is left unemancipated, and that no feudal remnants are left behind.

　　打破复查障碍
    王屋纠正“差不多”思想
    沁县翻身农民集会庆祝准备复查
    【本报太岳九日电】王屋在复查中因干部“差不多思想”障碍运动深入。该县土地改革运动基本上完成后，干部即大松一口气，发生了“差不多思想”甚至有人说：“革命工作那天也作不完，差不多就行啦。”又加支援前线繁忙，忽视深入复查，致使某些村庄封建势力又形复活。如一区花园沟地主竟质问妇救会秘书说：“你依啥来斗争我？现在人人都讲平等，我也应该翻身啦！”并提出退还他土地三十亩，楼房二座。三区有些村庄农民，仍然害怕地主，将分得土地，暗地里退给地主，致使许多贫苦农民仍未能翻身。此外不少干部与积极分子多得果实，仍未退还群众，甚至有继续贱买果实的现象。现已引起领导上注意，正设法纠正中。
    【本报太岳九日电】沁县经过七个月持续的斗争，土地改革已大体完成。上月二十二日，全县五万翻身农民，齐集城内庆祝土地还家。游行队伍由武装民兵领着，抬着毛主席大画像，鼓乐喧天，进入会场。齿摇发落的老汉、老婆踏着步像扭秧歌的样子，高兴的走着。十字街口，矗立着一座翻身纪念牌，规定二月十二日，为沁县农民翻身纪念日。这次土地改革，全县有八万余人卷入运动，前后经过五千八百次大小斗争，现全县已有二万一千无地少地的农户，获得土地，他们从地主豪绅奸霸手里，收回土地九万四千二百余亩，楼房二万三千间，往日穷苦无地的农民，绝大部分已打下生产发家的基础。封建统治的主要柱石为大汉奸牛晖汉、王邦正、史锡魁、李世文等已受到群众审判。大地主田金泉、周汉杰、魏安仁等也被斗得威风扫地，整个农村面貌变了个新样，人民已得到以前从来没有的真正民主生活，工农群众第一次作了社会的主人。许多娶不起老婆的穷老汉现在也结了婚。全县小学生已增加六千五百余人，往日在地主经营之下荒芜了的四千余亩土地，农民都已分配耕种。为珍贵这一伟大历史事业，沁县农会并决定立即进行一次普遍的复查，不让一个农民没地种，不让一个农民不翻身，也不让留下一个封建尾巴。
