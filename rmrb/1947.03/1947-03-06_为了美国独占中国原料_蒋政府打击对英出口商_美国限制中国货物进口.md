Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai: The Chiang Kai-shek government, through the Central Bank, officially began posting exchange rates for the supply and purchase of Chiang currency against the Hong Kong dollar and Sterling Bloc currencies on the 28th. The rates offered to importers are 48,000 Chiang currency to one pound sterling (based on one pound sterling equaling four US dollars) and 3,000 Chiang currency to one Hong Kong dollar. The rates offered for purchase from exporters are 40,000 Chiang currency to one pound sterling and 2,500 Chiang currency to one Hong Kong dollar. According to economic circles: This move by the Chiang government is a double blow to Chinese exporters. The sterling exchange rate of 48,000 yuan was already lower than the actual exchange rate. Furthermore, the Central Bank skims off another 8,000 yuan in the process of buying and selling. Exporters will find it even less profitable, and consequently, China's export trade, especially exports to Britain, will inevitably suffer a major blow. Last year, China's exports to Britain plummeted compared to pre-war levels, amounting to only just over 2.48 million pounds (while British goods exported to China amounted to 4.93 million pounds last year). This year, it will be even lower. The Chiang government's suicidal sterling exchange policy is to facilitate its master, the United States, in monopolizing the Chinese raw materials market.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: A Shanghai dispatch on the 20th: Due to the US government's adoption of new import restrictions, China's export trade is facing an increasing crisis. According to Shanghai newspapers: The US government has recently stipulated that importers and exporters must first apply to the US government for a letter of credit for transporting goods and obtain an import license before they can request foreign exchange settlement from the bank. However, the issuance of such letters of credit is severely restricted, and it is often difficult to obtain approval. Coupled with the Chiang government's rapid inflation of paper money and soaring prices, the prices of Chinese export goods are even higher than in the United States. For example, tung oil sells for over 10,000 US dollars per dan in the United States, while it costs over 100,000 yuan in Shanghai. Adding transportation costs, exporters will suffer significant losses. Recently, American ships are often fully loaded with American goods coming into China, but return empty.

　　为了美国独占中国原料  蒋政府打击对英出口商
    美国限制中国货物进口
    【新华社延安四日电】据中央社沪讯：蒋币对港币及英镑集团货币之供应及收进价格，蒋托中央银行已于二十八日开始正式挂牌：供应进口商者，为四万八千蒋币合一英镑（按一英镑等于四美元），三千元蒋币合一港元；由出口商收进者，为四万蒋币合一英镑，二千五百蒋币合一港元。据经济界称：蒋政府此举是对中国出口商的双重打击，四万八千元之英镑汇率原已低于实际汇率，再加中央银行一进一出之间又刮去八千元，出口商将更无利可图，且因此中国出口贸易特别是对英输出，势必大受打击。去年中国对英出口较之战前一落千丈，仅为二百四十八万余镑（按去年英货输华为四百九十三万镑），今年将更减低。蒋政府之自杀性的英汇系为便利其主人美国对中国原料市场之独占。
    【新华社延安四日电】二十日沪讯：由于美国政府采取新的限制进口办法，中国出口贸易益陷危机。据沪报称：美国政府最近规定进出口商运输货物需先向美政府声请信用状，获得进口许可证，始得向银行请求结汇。但此种信用状发给限制极严，多难获准，加上蒋政府剧烈膨胀纸币，物价飞涨，中国出口货价格较美国尤高。如桐油每担在美卖万余元美金，在沪为十余万元，加上运费出口商即大亏其本，近日常有美国轮船满载美货进口而空船驶返现象。
