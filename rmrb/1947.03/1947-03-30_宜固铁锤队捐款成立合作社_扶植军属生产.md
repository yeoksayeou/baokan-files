    Yigu Iron Hammer Team Donates Funds to Establish Cooperative
    Supporting Military Families' Production
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] The Yigu Village Patriotic Home-Protecting Iron Hammer Team in the fifth district of Yangcheng County is supporting military families' production by donating funds to establish the "Unity and Resistance Cooperative." Wang Yuan, the leader of the Iron Hammer Team, and team members such as Su Jingyun, donated a total of 385,000 yuan to help the cooperative open an oil press. The oil press can produce 20 jin of oil per day, earning 20 oil cakes. With a monthly profit of 600 oil cakes, the 88 military families in the village, with over 800 mu of land, can each use an average of five oil cakes per mu as fertilizer, which can completely solve the fertilizer difficulties for military families during spring plowing. Under the leadership of the Unity and Resistance Cooperative, each Iron Hammer Team member guarantees to help one military family with production. Currently, they are first organizing military families to dig and build earthwork. In addition, the cooperative guarantees to solve any difficulties faced by military families. For example, when military families like Li Guiying lack farm tools, the cooperative immediately adjusts and provides them. When the masses lack oil and salt, the cooperative transports salt and lends it to them, guaranteeing repayment after the summer harvest this year. Not only will the government benefit from the "Unity and Resistance Cooperative's" profits, but military families will also receive preferential treatment.

    宜固铁锤队捐款成立合作社
    扶植军属生产
    【本报太岳廿七日电】阳城五区宜固村爱国保家铁锤队扶植军属生产，捐款成立“优抗同心合作社”。铁锤队王源及其队员苏景云等，共捐款三十八万五千元，帮助合作社开设油坊，每天可打油二十斤，赚油饼二十个。一月赚油饼六百个，全村军属八十八户，八百余亩土地，每亩平均施用油饼五个作肥料，可全部解决军属春耕肥料困难。在同心合作社领导下，每个铁锤队员保证帮助一户军属生产，目前首先组织军属刨地垒，此外合作社保证军属有啥困难就解决啥。如军属李桂英等缺乏农具，合作社便即刻为之调剂；群众缺油盐，合作社便运盐借给用，保证在今年夏收后还完。不仅政府以“同心合作社”盈利，军属即可受到优待。
