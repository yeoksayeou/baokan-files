[Taixing News, 21st] At the LiCheng Second District Duanjiazhuang political director Comrade Zhang Haitang, at the district cadre merit and unity conference on the 8th of this month, consciously reviewed his mistakes. He said: "When I first heard the call from the higher authorities to implement 'land to the tiller' and completely eliminate feudalism, I was determined to serve the masses. But when it came to distributing the fruits, I forgot the pain once the wound healed, and only considered myself, forgetting my poor friends. In the first scoring, it was stipulated that whoever was active would订分more. Cadres shielded each other. I should have gotten six points, but I was rated seven. Under my influence, the cadres' scores increased. There is also something I'm sorry to the masses about. One dark night, several of us cadres went to the village office for a meeting. Passing by the fruit storage room, I took a hoe, the civil affairs director also took a hoe, and the education director and Farmers' Association chairman Yang Licheng each took a mulberry hoe. This made us afraid to tell on others. When the masses reflected that the fruits were missing, I felt uneasy. When the masses questioned, I said they couldn't be lost, probably in the village office. The few of us secretly put back what we had taken. When County Chief Dong went to my village, I told him in detail. He said it was good to know your mistakes and admit them. I confessed in the civil school and told the masses: 'Whoever has any opinions on the cadres and cooperatives, boldly raise them. There will be no retaliation.' I also educated the cadres, saying: 'Don't dislike being poor, admitting mistakes to the masses and returning the extra fruits is what makes a good cadre.' Influenced by this, the cadres all 'washed their faces,' and returned the extra fruits. The whole village achieved filling the gaps and making up the deficiencies. If the main beam is not straight, the secondary beams will be crooked. Cadres are the leaders; don't lead the way astray." At this time, all the cadres and activists in the audience were moved, vying with each other to 'wash' their own 'black,' unanimously saying: "Learn from Zhang Haitang, resolutely return the fruits to the masses."

    黎城二区干部立功团结大会上
    张海棠自觉说实话
    感动全场纷退果实
    【本报太行廿一日电】黎城二区段家庄政治主任张海棠同志，在本月八日全区干部立功团结大会上，自觉检讨错误。他说：“我开初听到上级号召实行耕者有其田彻底消灭封建时，便决心要为群众服务；但到分配果实时，却揭了疮疤忘了痛，只为我个人打算，把穷朋友们都忘啦。第一次评分，规定谁积极谁多订分，干部互相包庇，我本应六分，给我评了七分，在我影响下，干部们分数提高了。我还有一件对不起群众的事，有一天黑夜我们几个干部去村公所开会，路过果实保管房，我取了一把钗，民事主任也取了一把镢，教育主任和农会主席杨礼成各取了一把桑钗，弄得咱也不敢说人家。群众反映果实丢了时，我行坐不安，群众追问，我说丢不了，大概是在村公所放着，我们几个把私取的东西又悄悄的放回去。董县长去我村，我给他详细说了，他说知错认错就好，我便在民校内坦白了，并给群众说：谁对干部和合作社有意见，就大胆提，决不报复。又教育干部说：“大家不要嫌差，向群众认错退出多分果实才是好干部。影响干部都洗了脸，退出多得果实，全村做到填平补齐。大梁不正二梁歪，干部是带头人，千万不要引坏路。”这时全场干部积极分子都感动了，争先恐后抢着洗自己的黑，一致说：“学习张海棠，坚决给群众退果实。”
