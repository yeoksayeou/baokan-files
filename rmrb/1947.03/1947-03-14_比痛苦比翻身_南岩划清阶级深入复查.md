　　Comparing Suffering, Comparing Emancipation:
    Nanyan Distinguishes Class Status and Conducts Thorough Re-investigation
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 12th] Nanyan Village in Gaoyi County is conducting a re-investigation by comparing suffering and comparing emancipation. In previous land reform movements, many problems were left unresolved due to the lack of thoroughness of the cadres. At the beginning of this rectification movement, the village cadres and activists believed that there were no more problems, that the land reform was complete, and that there were no loose ends. They felt that even if there were a few backward elements, there was no way to mobilize them. After the district cadres arrived in the village and discovered the problems, they convened the cadres to explain the policy of filling in the gaps and making up for deficiencies. After discussion, everyone realized that filling in the gaps was a meticulous task that required patience and thoroughness. If the backward peasants were not emancipated and the landlords were not thoroughly defeated, they launched a comparison of emancipation within the peasant association. First, the comparison was made in group meetings, and everyone raised many opinions: that the poor who should have been emancipated had not received the fruits of the struggle, while those who should not have been emancipated had been given livestock. Then, a general meeting was held to allow everyone to speak. Geng Ge Ying said, "I used to work as a hired laborer and beg for food. It was only after the Communist Party came that I was emancipated and given land, but I still don't have any livestock. But Geng Lao Min (a bankrupt landlord) used to live by exploitation. During the struggle, he made a suggestion and was given livestock." Downward-mobile rogue landlord Ming Qiu (who is now living as a middle peasant) stood up and wanted to compare as well. Everyone said, "What right do you have to be emancipated? You used to wear silk and satin, strolling around, and you even got a share of the spoils?" Through the comparison of emancipation, the landlords were isolated, the class boundaries were clarified, and the masses' awareness was raised. They truly recognized who were the exploiters and who were the exploited. It was also discovered that although landlord Geng Lao Chang had been struggled against, his life was still better than that of a middle peasant, and he still had two wives. At the same time, some "backward" peasants had opinions about the distribution of the fruits of the struggle, feeling that "it doesn't matter whether you speak up or not, it doesn't help to speak up, why bother." The slogan "Mobilize the backward, thoroughly eliminate feudalism" was immediately put forward, and the struggle was launched again. The cadres were determined to make this movement a success.

　　比痛苦比翻身
    南岩划清阶级深入复查
    【本报太行十二日电】比痛苦、比翻身，高邑南岩村进行复查。过去多次翻身运动中，因干部不深入，曾遗留下不少问题。在这次填补运动开始时，该村干部与积极分子却认为没问题了，翻身彻底，尾巴也没有了，就是有几个落后分子，什么办法也发动不起来。区干部到村发现问题后，召集干部讲了填平补齐的方针，又经讨论，大家才认识了填补是一个细致的工作，须要耐心深入，落后农民翻不了身，地主也打不垮。即在农会中展开比翻身。首先在小组会上比，大家就提出了好多意见，该翻身的穷人没分上果实，不该翻身的却分得了牲口。接着即开大会，让大家都说。耿哥影说：“我过去当长工、要饭，共产党来了我才翻了身，分到土地，但是还没有牲口。可是耿老敏（破产地主）过去是靠剥削生活，斗争中，他提了个意见，却分上牲口了。”下降流氓地主明秋（现过着中农生活）站起来也要比，大家都说：“你凭什也要翻身，过去穿绸摆缎，游来摆去，还分果实呢？”经过比翻身，孤立了地主，划清了阶级界线，群众觉悟提高，真正认识了谁是剥削者与被剥削者。并查出地主耿老昌虽经斗争，但其生活比中农还强，现在还是两个老婆。同时有些“落后”农民对分果实有意见，觉得“提不提没什，提出来也不顶事，提他干嘛。”当即提出“发动落后，彻底扫除封建”为口号，再次展开斗争，干部决心把这次运动搞好。
