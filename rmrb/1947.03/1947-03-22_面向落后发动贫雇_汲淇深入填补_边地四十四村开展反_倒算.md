    Mobilizing the Poor and Hired Peasants in Backward Areas
    Jixian and Qi County Intensify Efforts to Fill the Gaps
    Anti-"Reversal of Settlements" Launched in Forty-Four Border Villages
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 20th] Jixian and Qi County, west of the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan, have reached an advanced stage in the effort to fill the gaps, and the anti-"reversal of settlements" in the border areas has also been further developed. In the hinterland, 23 of the 44 administrative villages have distributed the fruits [of the struggle]. According to statistics from 13 villages, peasants have recovered more than 600 mu of land, more than 700 rooms, 40 head of livestock, and more than 800 shi of grain (not including other clothing, furniture, etc.). During the movement, attention was paid to mobilizing the backward elements. A total of 330 backward masses were mobilized in 13 villages, of which more than 190 have become activists, and 97 women activists have emerged. In late February and early March, the hinterland shifted to in-depth work, digging "air-raid shelters." Statistics from 16 villages show that 63 peasants voluntarily reported the land, livestock, and grain hidden for landlords, as well as four short guns and 200 bullets. During the movement, the leadership grasped three key links: first, widespread and in-depth propaganda for "land to the tiller," repeatedly explaining to the masses that this is reasonable and legal, breaking the shackles of the old policies; second, mass class division, clarifying the goals of the struggle for the masses, stabilizing the middle peasants, and preventing chaos in the ranks; and third, using poor peasants as the backbone and starting with the backward elements, the movement is showing strength.
    In the border areas, anti-"reversal of settlements" has been carried out in 44 villages in the past month, with armed activity supporting the masses. The militia and armed work teams of the Third District captured nine members of the "Returning Home Corps" and "Reversal of Settlements Team" in ten days. The movement of "holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other" has been widely launched. In early March, county and district cadres held a meeting to summarize the February movement. Everyone was in high spirits, and each district competed with each other, proposing: "Carry out the liberation to the end and make contributions to the people!" (Wenshu, Cheng Guo)

    面向落后发动贫雇
    汲淇深入填补
    边地四十四村开展反“倒算”
    【本报太行二十日电】豫北平汉西侧汲淇县，填补运动已至深入阶段，边地的反“倒算”亦有进一步开展。腹地四十四个行政村，已有廿三个村分配了果实。据十三个村统计：农民收回土地六百余亩，房七百余间，牲口四十头，粮食八百余石（其他衣物家具等未计）。运动中注意了发动落后，十三个村共发动起三百三十个落后群众，其中一百九十余人已成为积极分子，涌现出九十七个妇女积极分子。二月底三月初，腹地即转入深入，挖“防空洞”。十六个村统计：有六十三个农民自动报出替地主隐藏之土地、牲口、粮食等及短枪四支、子弹二百发。运动中，领导上抓住了三个环节：一是普遍深入的宣传耕者有其田，反复给群众说明这是合理合法的，打破旧政策的束缚；二是群众性的划分阶级，使群众明确了斗争目标，安定了中农，阵营不乱；三是以贫农为骨干，从落后层着手，运动表现着有力。
    在边地，一月来有四十四个村进行了反“倒算”，武装活动给群众撑腰；三区民兵、武工队，十天即捕捉了“还乡团”、“倒算队”九名。“一手拿枪，一手分田”的运动，已普遍开展。三月初，县区干部集会总结二月运动，大家情绪极高，各区互相竞赛，提出：“把翻身搞到底，为人民立功劳。”（文书、成国）
