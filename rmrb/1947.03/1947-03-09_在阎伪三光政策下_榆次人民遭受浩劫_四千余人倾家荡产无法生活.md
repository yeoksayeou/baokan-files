[This dispatch from our newspaper's Taihang Office on the 7th] Under Yan's puppet "Three Alls" policy, the Yuci County government recently announced the losses suffered by 39 villages in the county due to Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard "burn all, kill all, loot all" policy over the past year. These include: over 28,600 *shi* of grain, over 500 head of livestock, and over 3,600 sheep. The total value of these three items alone reaches 124.4 million yuan. Other losses are impossible to calculate. Over a thousand women were raped and young men were seized. More than two thousand people were ruined and unable to live, and many have moved to villages in the heart of the Liberated Areas, where the village people's government provides relief and supports their production to help them maintain their livelihoods. The people universally declare: "If Yan Xishan doesn't die, we will never be able to live!"
