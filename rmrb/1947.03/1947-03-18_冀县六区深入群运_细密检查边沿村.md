　　Jixian Sixth District Deepens Mass Movement
　　Thoroughly Inspects Border Villages
　　[Our newspaper, Southern Hebei, 16th dispatch] Jixian Sixth District was the first to respond to the county committee's call to thoroughly inspect the mobilization of the backward, completely eliminate feudalism, and launched a surprise attack on the northernmost border villages. Since the launch of the mass movement in Nantulu Village, district cadres have rarely visited. The landlords have not been overthrown. For example, each member of a landlord's family was allowed to retain ten mu of land, and not only good land but also wheat fields. All kinds of furniture and items were untouched, and each family still had two or three houses, while poor people only had one room per household. After the inspection was arranged, the district committee discussed focusing on this village for a surprise attack. After the district cadres conducted a thorough inspection of the village, it was discovered that five landlord families had not been thoroughly struggled against. Among them, Wu Xianting's family used to cultivate more than three qing of land, fed six mules, and hired eighteen male and female long-term laborers. After the incident, although they were reduced to more than two qing of land, they still hired two long-term laborers. After a thorough reckoning with the five landlord families in the village, a total of more than 70 mu of land, more than 50 houses, two cattle, one mule, seven pigs, one box, 150 bullets, 96 large gun bullets, and many other items were seized.
　　[Our newspaper, Southern Hebei, 16th dispatch] Julu Shifodian unearths hidden property of traitorous and despotic landlords. Landlord Li Yixiang in the village had 140 mu of land before the incident, five people in his family, hired one worker, rented out 100 mu of land, and lent money at high interest. He began to hide his wealth as early as 1939, selling 100 mu of land, getting rid of his hired worker, and selling his cattle during the famine, superficially becoming a middle peasant. During the mass movement for emancipation, he was reasoned with and accounts were settled, totaling 1.83 million yuan in compensation for losses. Li Yixiang was speechless and ran out of arguments in front of the masses, but refused to pay the compensation, saying, "You can take my life, but I have no money." The masses knew that his family had hidden property, so they sent militiamen to search his house, and as a result, they found 100 bags of grain, more than 200 yuan in silver, and many other packages of cloth. The fruits are now being distributed.

　　冀县六区深入群运
    细密检查边沿村
    【本报冀南十六日电】冀县六区首先响应县委会深入检查发动落后彻底消灭封建的号召，对最北部边沿村进行突击。南土路口村自开展群运以来，区干部很少到过，地主没有打垮，如对一家地主每人按十亩地留，不但留好地，且是麦地，各种家具东西也一概未动，房子每家仍有两三处，贫苦群众每户只合一间房子。自布置检查后，区委会即讨论以这村为重点，进行突击，经区干到村细密检查，又发现五户地主没斗彻底，其中吴献亭家从前种三顷多地，喂六条骡子，雇着十八个男女长工，事变后虽落到两顷多地，仍雇着两个长工。该村对五户地主彻底清算后，共斗出土地七十余亩、房子五十多间、牛两头、骡子一匹、猪七口、盒子一把、子弹一百五十粒、大枪子弹九十六粒，其他东西甚多。
    【本报冀南十六日电】巨鹿石佛店挖出奸霸地主隐蔽财物。该村地主李义祥事变前有地一百四十亩，人五口，雇工一人，租出地一百亩，并高利放账。他民国二十八年即开始隐蔽，卖地一百亩，去掉雇工，过灾荒时又把牛卖了，表面上成了中农。群众翻身运动中向他说理清算，总计应赔偿损失一百八十三万元，李义祥在群众面前理屈词穷，但应赔偿部分死不拿出，并说：“要了命也没款”；群众知道他家有隐蔽财物，便派民兵去他家找，结果找出粮食一百口袋，现洋二百多元，其他包袱布匹很多，现正分配果实中。
