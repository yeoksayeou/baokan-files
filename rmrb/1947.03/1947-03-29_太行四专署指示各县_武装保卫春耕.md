    Taihang Fourth Special District Office Directs Counties
    to Arm to Defend Spring Plowing
    [Report from this newspaper] The Taihang Fourth Special District Office issued instructions to all counties on the 6th of this month to arm and defend spring plowing and production. The main points are as follows: (1) Boldly mobilize the masses for guerrilla warfare to defend spring plowing and summer harvest. In guerrilla warfare, we must always make ideological and organizational preparations to cooperate with the main forces for counter-offensive and to recover lost territories. Pay attention to combining labor and military force, participation in war and production. Be prepared to participate in the war at any time. (2) In border areas, the masses should be organized to hold a gun in one hand and plow in the other, fighting when the enemy comes and plowing when the enemy leaves. In the core areas, some people and animal power should be organized to prepare the fields early, deliver manure, plow the land, and rush to sow seeds. (3) Ensure the completion of the task of self-spinning and weaving 540,000 catties of homespun cloth. (4) In spring plowing, we must rationally use labor to organize mutual assistance, formulate household plans, and promptly discover and cultivate labor heroes, model families, model groups and villages, promptly reward them and disseminate their experiences, and establish banners in spring plowing production.
