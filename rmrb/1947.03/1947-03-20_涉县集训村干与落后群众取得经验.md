    Solving the Cadre-Masses Knot: Two Fears Turn into Two Laughs
　　She County Intensive Training of Village Cadres Gains Experience with Backward Masses
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 17th] To improve cadre-masses relations, break down obstacles to mobilizing the backward elements, and smoothly carry out the review, district head Li Duo and Farmers' Association Chairman Liu Kezheng held a comprehensive training class from the 5th to the 9th for 158 people, including cadres, activists, and backward peasants from five key villages in Zhongyuan (Zhongyuan, Beiyuan, Nanyuan, Taipingzhuang, and Zhan'ao). According to comrades Li and Liu, regarding the training situation and experience: Among the 158 people who registered, there were 51 cadres, 24 activists, and 83 backward peasants. Because the main problem in the Zhongyuan key point was the "knots" between cadres and the masses, they were divided into two teams, one for cadres and one for backward peasants. Activists alienated from the masses (8 people) joined the cadre team, while those with good relations with the masses (16 people) joined the backward peasant team. After the mobilization of "holding family-style talks, chatting about daily life, resolving 'knots,' and achieving great unity," the two teams proceeded separately. Initially, backward peasants were afraid to express their opinions, fearing "retaliation" from the cadres; the cadres were panic-stricken, fearing mass struggle. At this point, the slogan "Turn two 'fears' into two 'laughs'" was put forward, and "taking rhubarb" was used on the backward peasants; "Guarantee that cadres will not retaliate; say whatever you want and vent it all out," while cultivating typical speakers. After half a day of deliberation, the opinions began to be raised. Wang Ting, a poor peasant from Zhongyuan, said: "The public security director of our village, Lü Jinbao, just has a bad work style. We are really afraid of him. Last winter, during the struggle against the landlord Sun Zhanguo and others, Lü Jinbao was not often around. I said he was eating the landlord's mutton and shielding the landlord, and proposed replacing the cadre. Lü Jinbao retaliated. He said I was a special agent attacking cadres and imprisoned me for seven days. When distributing the fruits, I said we should investigate carefully and fill them according to the size of the gully, but the cadre said there was no time and just used the 'grabbing paper balls' method to divide them blindly. Farmers' Association Chairman Sun Zhanmei got a lot and it was good. If you had a kiln, you wanted to divide a house; if you had a house, you wanted to divide a kiln; if you had both a house and a kiln, you divided a foundation as well. No one in the masses dared to say anything." Then, Wang, Yang Quan, and others raised many opinions to cadres like Lü Jinbao. At this time, the policy of "adding fuel to the fire" was used, allowing the masses to vent their opinions about the cadres thoroughly. Indeed, there were more and more opinions, and 54 people spoke. After the masses had fully expressed their opinions about the village cadres, and then traced the root, they boldly raised opinions about the district cadres. Feng Xiaoliu from Zhongyuan said: "District Head Li, you were somewhat subjective about Yang Zaolin's residence. You only listened to the village cadres and didn't listen to the masses before making a decision. In the future, don't just follow the cadre line, but also follow our mass line; don't just live in the cadres' homes when you come, but also go outside to inquire; when you live in the cadres' homes, we don't dare to go, how can we reflect our opinions to you." District Head Li praised Feng Xiaoliu's opinion, and then Wang Qun and Chen Guiwen from Beiyuan also raised opinions.

    干群疙瘩解开两个怕变成两个笑
　　涉县集训村干与落后群众取得经验
    【本报太行十七日电】涉县九区为改善干群关系，打破发动落后障碍，顺利进行复查，区长李铎与农会主席刘克正，于五日至九日，举办了中原基点五个村（中原、北原、南原、太平庄、占凹）的干部、积极分子、落后农民共一百五十八人的一揽子训练班。据李、刘二同志谈训练的情况和经验说：报到的一百五十八人中，有干部五十一人、积极分子二十四人、落后农民八十三人。因中原基点的主要问题是干群结有“圪瘩”所以就分了两队，一队是干部，一队是落后农民。脱离群众的积极分子（八人）归干部队，与群众关系好的（十六人）参加落后农民队。在“开家庭会谈家常和解开‘圪瘩’大团结”的动员后，两队分头进行。开始时，落后农民有意见不敢提，怕干部“报复”；干部恐慌，怕群众斗争。这时就提出“把两个‘怕’变成两个‘笑’”的口号，对落后农民“吃大黄”；“保证干部不报复，有啥说啥泻透肚”，同时培养发言典型。经过半天酝酿便提开了，中原赤贫王廷说：“俺村公安主任吕金保就是作风不好，咱真怕人家。去冬斗争地主孙占国等时，吕金保不常在，我说是吃了地主羊肉，包庇地主，提出要换干部。吕金保就报复。说我是特务打击干部，将我禁闭了七天。分果实时，我说要好好调查一下按圪道大小填，干部说没那时间，就用“抓纸弹”办法瞎分开。农会主席孙占梅分得多又好，有窑想分房，有房想分窑，房窑齐全又分了地基，群众谁也不敢吭。”接着王、杨全等都给吕金保等干部提了许多意见。这时就用了“火上添油”的政策，叫群众对干部的意见发泄个透。真的，意见越来越多，发言者有五十四人。当群众对村干部意见发透后，再追一下根，就大胆对区干部提开意见了。中原冯小流说：“李区长，杨造林住的事，你就有些主观主义，你们光听村里干部话没听群众话就决定了。以后你们不要光走干部路线，也走走俺们这群众路线；不要一来就死住在干部家，也到外面打探打探；你们一住到干部家，俺们就不敢去，那能给你反映意见。”李区长表扬了冯小流提的意见后，接着王群和北原陈贵文都提了意见。
