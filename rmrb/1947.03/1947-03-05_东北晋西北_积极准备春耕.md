　　Northeast and Northwest Shanxi
    Actively Prepare for Spring Plowing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd] The Northeast Daily published an editorial on the 23rd, calling on all areas to actively prepare for spring plowing, stating in brief: The broad masses of peasants in the Northeast Liberated Areas have already obtained land; this is a solid foundation for organizing production this year. The basic task of spring plowing is to ensure that all land cultivated last year is sown, and, where possible, to cultivate as much reclaimed wasteland as possible. At the same time, preparation for spring plowing should be coordinated with land reform, so that areas that are "half-cooked" (i.e., areas where work has not been fully completed) thoroughly resolve the land problem, and should help peasants solve difficulties such as plowing livestock, seeds, fertilizer, and farm implements. In addition to government agricultural loans, the most important method is to rely on organizing shared plowing, exchange labor, and mutual assistance, utilizing existing folk organizational forms and kinship to adjust, so as to avoid delaying spring plowing and leaving land uncultivated due to a lack of plowing livestock, etc.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd] Amidst the cheers of "land returns home" in the Northeast Liberated Areas, peasants in various regions are actively purchasing and adjusting livestock in preparation for spring plowing. In Wang Fenglou Village, Ning'an County, Songjiang Province, villages that possessed livestock given by the "Development Group" during the puppet Manchukuo period voluntarily donated thirty-two cattle and four horses to poor peasants in their own and neighboring villages. In Dexin Township, Yanji County, Jilin Province, more than 100,000 yuan obtained from liquidation was used to buy seventeen cattle and distribute them to poor households. Sancheng Township also used 82,000 yuan (each yuan equivalent to 15 yuan in Chiang's currency) from liquidation funds and 5,000 yuan donated by the village farmers' association to buy nine cattle and distribute them to eighteen poor households, with two households sharing one head of cattle. Pei You and his son, farmers in Yanshou County, Songjiang Province, used their winter leisure time to gather firewood and used the proceeds to buy a horse. In Bin County, various places have organized cooperation between households with carts and horses and households without carts and horses for exchange labor and mutual assistance in production. Guo Yintang, a farmer in a certain district of Tonghe, excitedly said: "My family has never raised livestock for generations. This year, I was given land and bought livestock. This is truly the greatest joy of my life."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 3rd] In various counties in Northwest Shanxi that have undergone land reform, peasants are actively expanding spring plowing. Yaozhuang Village, Baode County, used the profits from winter production to purchase thirteen more plowing cattle. After the Spring Festival celebration of the liberation conference, all thirty households in the village organized all their manpower and livestock to change work, and all fertilizer for three thousand acres of cultivated land has been delivered. Xiawang and three other villages along the Hutuo River in Maicun each increased rice paddies by more than a hundred acres, which can increase production by twenty large shi (a unit of dry measure). The Ningwu trading agency distributed 5 million yuan in industrial loans and helped produce 40,000 jin of iron, organizing more than 150 ironworkers to rush to manufacture various farm implements. In January, more than 8,000 finished products of various sizes were produced and transported for sale to new areas such as Xinxian County and Shuoxian County to meet the needs of farmers for spring plowing.

　　东北晋西北
    积极准备春耕
    【新华社东北三日电】东北日报于二十三日发表社论，号召各地积极准备春耕，略称：东北解放区广大农民已获得土地，这是今年组织生产的坚固基础。春耕的基本任务是保证去年耕种的土地，全部种上并在可能条件下，尽力开一部分熟荒。同时准备春耕要和土地改革配合起来，使“半生不熟”地区（即工作未完全做好的地区）彻底解决土地问题，并应帮助农民解决耕畜、种籽、肥料和农具等困难。除可用政府的农贷外，最主要的办法要靠组织搭犋、换工和互助，利用民间原有的组织形式和亲属关系来调剂，务期不致因耕畜等缺乏，而延误春耕和荒芜土地。
    【新华社东北三日电】东北解放区各地农民在欢庆“土地回家”声中。纷纷购买与调剂牲口，积极准备春耕。松江宁安县王凤楼村，拥有伪满时“开拓团”放给牲口的各村，自动捐出牛三十二头、马四匹，分给本村和邻屯的贫苦农民。吉林延吉县德新乡，将清算得来的十多万元，买了十七头牛分给贫户。三成乡也以清算现款八万二千元（每元合蒋币十五元）及村农会的五千元捐款，买了九头牛，分给十八家贫户，每两家合养一头。松江延寿县农民裴有父子二人，利用冬闲打柴，以收益买进马一匹。宾县各地组织有车马户和无车马户合作，换工互助生产。通河某区农民郭印堂兴奋地说：我家几辈子没养过牲口，今年分了地又买了牲口，真是这辈子最大的喜欢。
    【新华社晋绥三日电】晋西北经过土地改革的各县，农民正积极扩大春耕。保德腰庄村以冬季生产获利，增买耕牛十三头，在春节庆祝翻身大会后，全村三十户将人畜力全部组织变工，已将三千亩耕地肥料送毕。沿沪沱河买村下旺等四村，每村增开稻田百余亩，能增产二十大石。宁武贸易机关发放工贷五百万元，并帮助产铁四万斤，组织一百五十余铁业工人，赶造各种农具。一月份已制出大小成品八千余件，运销于新忻县、朔县等新区，以供农民春耕需要。
