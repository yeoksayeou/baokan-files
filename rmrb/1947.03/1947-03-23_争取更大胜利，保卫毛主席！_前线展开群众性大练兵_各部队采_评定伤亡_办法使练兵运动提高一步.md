[This dispatch from the front lines of the JiluYu region, March 21st] Following the heroes' congress, a mass sharpening movement has unfolded within General Liu Bocheng's unit. Their slogan is: "Sharpen our blades well, kill more enemies, defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao!" During the sharpening movement, every officer and soldier can accurately execute Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's instructions: Fight battles against different enemies using different methods; pay attention to summarizing actual combat and field exercises. Artillerymen, machine gunners, and riflemen all have a very serious concept of the enemy situation in the exercises, and can strive to think about how to effectively shoot and advance under enemy fire, break through the front lines, expand the depth, and pursue and annihilate the enemy. Many combatants especially like to pursue. At present, this movement is gradually moving towards a climax through mutual aid groups, "Zhuge Liang meetings" where everyone thinks of solutions, and learning from Wang Keqin and other methods. In terms of shooting, a unit has produced 25 new skilled heavy machine gunners who are proficient in disassembling, assembling and troubleshooting with their eyes closed. They can also suddenly shoot at hidden and appearing fire targets 150 meters away at night, achieving 15 out of 30 bullets hitting the gun eye, and 15 bullets hitting within a 30-centimeter diameter around the gun eye. Some other shooters, at 200 meters away at night, can suddenly fire five rounds and guarantee that four rounds will hit the firing hole of a bunker. In terms of grenade throwing, driven by the Tang Qixing mutual aid group, a unit gets up at dawn to practice diligently, and now two squads have generally increased their throwing distance by ten meters. The reason for their excellent results is that they deeply understand the famous saying in the book "Fear and Fearlessness": "Victory is prepared before the battle."

[This dispatch from the front lines of the JiluYu region, March 21st] The JiluYu front-line troops have begun to adopt the "casualty assessment" method, which has greatly improved the military training movement. After the "casualty assessment" method created by the East China People's Liberation Army was published in the Battle Companion newspaper, the officers and soldiers of the front-line troops unanimously praised it, and the 24th Brigade immediately implemented it. The assessment results revealed that since the self-defense war, two-thirds of the casualties in the 5th Company of the 46th Regiment could have been avoided. For example, Liu Jingshan moved slowly when charging in the Yangzhuang battle and was knocked down by the enemy. Wang Ying casually ran out of the fortifications during the Junan campaign and was wounded by artillery shells. Yang Laijun, the squad leader of the small artillery team, led two soldiers in pursuit without dispersing and advancing. An artillery shell hit the middle, seriously injuring two and killing one. When An Sixiao and Ma Qingxi touched the edge of the village in the Yangzhuang battle, the enemy had not yet noticed them. Instead of continuing to advance, they shouted loudly, and a burst of machine gun fire from the enemy resulted in one injury and one death. Yang Xinling, Hesheng Xiao, and others were all wounded because they did not obey orders and did not conceal their bodies. After the "casualty assessment" review, the instructor realized that he had suffered a great loss by not observing the enemy. Platoon Leader Song Fujiang felt that he had not commanded well and was sorry for the wounded comrades. The new soldiers also clearly understood that "if you don't learn skills, you will suffer." Everyone said: "We must accept this bloody lesson and learn skills and techniques well." The troops' morale for military training has been greatly improved. New soldiers Jia Dongfa and Shi Fuhai practice grenade throwing and field movements during game time in the evening. Zhang Wenyuan, who was liberated from Yangzhuang, guaranteed to learn the small artillery within three days. Hu Shengkai had not learned bayonet fighting in the Chiang Kai-shek army, but he learned both forward and backward bayonet thrusts within two days. Now, most companies have been swept up in a hard training frenzy, and everyone automatically gets together before dawn every day to practice marching at quick time. (Wang Hutian)

    争取更大胜利，保卫毛主席！
    前线展开群众性大练兵
    各部队采“评定伤亡”办法使练兵运动提高一步
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十一日电】刘伯承将军某部于群英大会结束后，群众性的磨刀运动随即展开。他们的口号是：“磨好刀，多杀敌，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席。”在磨刀运动中，每一个指战员都能准确执行朱总司令所指示的：对什么敌人打什么仗；注意实战总结和野外演习的办法。炮手、机枪手、和步枪兵在演习中都有非常严肃的敌情观念，都能努力思虑在敌火下有效射击前进，突破前沿，扩展纵深，直到追歼敌人，许多战斗员特别喜欢追击。目前这一运动正通过互助组、“诸葛亮会”，大家想办法，学习王克勤等方式逐步走向高潮。射击方面，某单位已涌现新的重机枪手二十五名，熟练闭目拆装和排除故障，并在夜晚突然射击百五十公尺外枪眼内的隐现火靶时，作到每三十发弹射进枪眼十五发，射在枪眼周围直径三十生的范围内者十五发。另一些射击手夜晚在二百公尺以外，突然射五发，可保证四发射进地堡的射击孔。投弹方面，某部在唐奇兴互助组的推动下，黎明即起，发奋苦练，现两班已普遍增加十公尺。他们这种优越成绩的造成，是由于他们深刻懂得了《恐惧与无畏》一书上的名言：“胜利是在战斗之前准备的。”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十一日电】冀鲁豫前线部队开始采用“评定伤亡”办法，使练兵运动大大提高一步。华东人民解放军所创造的“评定伤亡”的办法在战友报发表后，前线各部队指战员都一致赞扬，二四部队并立即实行起来。评定结果，发觉四六部队第五部队自卫战争以来，全连伤亡中的三分之二是可以避免的。如刘景山在杨庄战斗中冲锋时动作慢，被敌人打倒。王英在鄄南战役时随便跑出工事，被炮弹打伤。小炮班长杨来军带领两个战士在追击时不分散前进，一个炮弹打在中间，两个重伤，一个牺牲。安四小、马清西二人在杨庄战斗中摸到村边时，敌人还没发觉，他们不继续前进反而大喊大叫，敌人一梭机枪打来，一伤一亡。杨心灵、荷生小等都是不听指挥不隐蔽身体而负伤。“评定伤亡”的检讨后，指导员认识了不观测敌人吃了大亏。排长宋福江感到自己没有指挥好，对不起负伤的同志。新战士也更清楚的知道了“不学本事就要吃亏”。大家都说：“我们一定要接受这一场血的教训，好好练本事学技术。”部队练兵情绪大大提高，新战士贾东法、石富孩晚上游戏时间演习投弹和野外动作。杨庄解放过来的张文元保证三天学会小炮，胡胜凯在蒋军里没学过刺杀，两天内就学会前进后退两种刺杀动作。现多数连练兵已卷入苦练热潮，每日天明以前大家都自动结合，练习急行军。（王虎田）
