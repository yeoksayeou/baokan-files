Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th: "Chiang Kai-shek's American-equipped infantry in the Northeast theater has been depleted by more than one-third." This was the conclusion reached by the Northeast Daily in its March 17th editorial celebrating the complete annihilation of the 88th Division of the American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek 71st Army and the complete rout of the 87th Division by the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces on the Songhua River front. The editorial pointed out that this unprecedented victory has made the changing situation in the Northeast more obvious and its development more rapid. After sternly refuting the arrogant and deceptive propaganda of Chiang Kai-shek, Du Yuming, and their ilk, the editorial stated: "Chiang Kai-shek's invading army in the Northeast consists of seven armies and twenty-one divisions, all equipped with American weapons, and represents the cream of the entire Chiang Kai-shek army. In addition, there are several security columns. However, in the year since March of last year, excluding the annihilated security forces and the Chiang Kai-shek troops annihilated in Rehe, the Chiang Kai-shek troops annihilated in the Northeast in whole regiments and battalions amount to more than seven divisions. This means that Chiang Kai-shek's American-equipped troops in the Northeast theater have been depleted by more than one-third. Although he can conscript soldiers according to the puppet Manchukuo national conscription register, he will inevitably encounter popular opposition, and the conscripted men, without training and with war-weariness and anti-war sentiments, will inevitably have reduced combat effectiveness." The editorial continued: "Our army will not only forever defend the interests of the people of the Northeast, but also, with the deepening of the land reform movement, our army's combat effectiveness will become increasingly vigorous and strong, and its initiative is rapidly increasing. Our army will and certainly can expand its victory and annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's troops by the thousands and tens of thousands and by whole divisions, achieving lasting peace for the people of the Northeast."

This Newspaper Reports: Yang Xiufeng and Rong Wusheng, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Border Government, telegraphed congratulations to the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces on their great victory in annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's 88th Division, stating: "We are delighted to hear that the Allied Forces completely annihilated Du Yuming's 88th Division and routed the 87th Division and the directly subordinate units of the 71st Army in the area of Kaoshantun, northwest of Dehui, on the 9th and 10th. The good news has made the entire region jubilant. The victory of the Songhua River counterattack not only shattered Chiang Kai-shek's shameless rumors but also supported the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region with the victory in the Northeast, dealing a heavy blow to Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bloody claws in their invasion of Yan'an. We hereby telegraph our congratulations and extend our regards."
    Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, and Vice Chairman Rong Wusheng, March 19th

    东北蒋军美械部队三分之一以上被歼
    边府电贺民主联军松花江反击胜利
    【新华社东北十九日电】“蒋介石在东北战场上的美械步队已消耗了三分之一以上”，这是东北日报十七日社论庆祝松花江前线东北民主联军完全歼灭美械蒋军七十一军八十八师及完全击溃八十七师的辉煌胜利时，对一年来蒋军侵犯东北解放区的总结。社论指出：此次空前胜利，使正在变化中的东北战局从此表现得更加明显，发展更加迅速。社论于严正驳斥蒋介石杜聿明辈狂妄欺骗宣传后称：“蒋介石侵入东北的军队共有七个军，二十一个师，全系美械装备，是全部蒋军的精华，此外还有几个保安纵队，而自去年三月迄今不过一年时间内，除被消灭的保安部队及在热河消灭的蒋军不计在内，单在东北境内蒋军整团整营被歼者计有七个多师兵力之多，这就是说蒋介石在东北战场上的美械部队消耗了三分之一以上了。虽然他可以按伪满国民兵册抓兵，但必遭人民反对，而且抓来的壮丁没有训练，加上厌战反战情绪，其战斗力必然降低。”社论继称：“我军将不仅永远保卫东北人民的利益，而且随着土地改革运动的深入，我军战斗力日益蓬勃壮大，主动性正在迅速增加，我军将要而且一定能够扩大胜利，把蒋军整万整千整师加以歼灭，达到东北人民永久之和平。”
    【本报讯】边府杨戎正副主席电贺东北民主联军歼灭蒋军八十八师之大捷称：欣闻联军于九、十两日在德惠西北靠山屯一带，歼灭杜聿明八十八师全部，并击溃八十七师及七十一军直属队。捷报传来，全区欢腾。松花江反击胜利，不仅粉碎了蒋介石无耻造谣，并且以东北的胜利策应陕甘宁，给蒋胡血爪进犯延安以重大打击。特此电贺并致慰忱。
