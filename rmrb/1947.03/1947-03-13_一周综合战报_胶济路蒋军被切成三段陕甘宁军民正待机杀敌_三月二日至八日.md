Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 11th: One Week Comprehensive War Report (March 2nd to 8th):

    Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against Yan'an is imminent, and the military and civilians of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have been urgently mobilized to meet Hu Zongnan with an iron fist. In the battle of Changchun in the Northeast, the Democratic Allied Forces strategically advanced and retreated, while Chiang Kai-shek boasted of victory and issued awards. In the battle on the Jiaoji Railway, Chiang Kai-shek's army has been cut into three sections, each of which has become an isolated force. These are the main features of this week's military situation.

    Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's deployment of seventeen brigades to attack Yan'an is basically complete, with their main force of four divisions on the Yichuan-Luochuan line, and more than two divisions also assembled west of the Luo River. The 29th and 17th divisions and other units feigning an attack on eastern Gansu have been mostly transferred east. The 48th Brigade of the 17th Division, stationed in Xihuachi, suffered heavy losses and has been transferred back to Guanzhong for replenishment. Qingyang, Heshui, and Xihuachi have all been recovered. Hu Zongnan has assembled an air force squadron in Xi'an and plans to use paratroopers against Yan'an.

    Few of Chiang's direct line troops remain in Shanxi. Yan Xishan cobbled together remnants to launch an offensive in central Shanxi. The 19th Army's Deputy Commander Yu Zhenhe and others led troops from Qixian, Pingyao, and Jiaocheng to attack Wenshui, losing nearly two regiments in the northwest suburbs of Wenshui on one day. The commander of the 72nd Division, Ai Ziqian, barely escaped with his life, and Wenshui City was once again recovered.

    In the Shandong war situation, Chiang's army's formation is becoming increasingly chaotic. Chiang Kai-shek is now ordering Chen Cheng to "reorganize the Shandong military structure, adjust and reconfigure the military agencies and troops." (United Press) Chen Cheng is frantically running between Xuzhou, Qingdao, and Jinan. This inept commander, who only knows how to issue orders telling his subordinates to "concentrate and await orders to attack at the opportune moment," is only making things worse the more he interferes! The Jiaoji line is no longer a line. Qingdao, Xuxian, and Jinan have become three points, and the middle point - Weixian - is like a lone boat in the sea, about to collapse! The Chiang army in the northern section of the Jinpu line is also wandering aimlessly, with no hope of resolving the crisis ahead and the danger of another "change of guard" behind. From the 1st to the 3rd, Zaozhuang and Guoliji, southeast of Beizhuang to its northeast, were once recovered by the People's Liberation Army. The Chiang army being driven out of the area east of the Shu River, north of the Lin(yi)-Qing(kou) highway, and on its south side are all examples of the Chiang army's distress.

    Chiang Kai-shek is boasting about the "victory" in Changchun, but the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recovered Jinan in the eastern line on the 4th, and the Allied Army has advanced more than 100 kilometers in the past ten days. On the 6th, Tongliao was recovered in the west, cutting the Da(hushan)-Tong(liao) railway in half, and the Allied Army has entered eastern Jehol. The Allied Army's anti-encirclement war in the area north of Changchun has come to an end, and it is gradually retreating to its original defense line. Chiang Kai-shek has been "fabricating war results" for days. The United Press also saw that "the Kuomintang's major propaganda offensive of the Communist army's 'paper' offensive against Changchun has turned into a 'paper' victory for the Kuomintang," and exposed that its purpose is to "offset the Communist army's victory in the Jinan area" because "the Kuomintang military is actually being duly punished in central Shandong."

    This week, the People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 10,000 enemy troops on all fronts and recovered five county towns – Qingyang and Heshui in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Gaomi in Shandong, and Jinan and Tongliao in the Northeast. Three cities were proactively evacuated – Manzhouli, Xi'an, and Jiutai.

　　一周综合战报
    胶济路蒋军被切成三段陕甘宁军民正待机杀敌
    三月二日至八日
    【新华社延安十一日电】一周综合战报：（二日至八日）
    将介石进攻延安的军事已箭在弦上，陕甘宁边区的军民已紧急的动员起来，用铁拳等待胡宗南。东北长春外国之战，民主联军有计划的进进出出，蒋介石却大吹法螺，自认胜利，大发奖状。胶济路的战事，蒋介石军已被切成三段，每一段已成孤军。这是本周军事主要的特点。
    蒋介石、胡宗南以十七个旅进攻延安的部署已基本完成，其主力四个师在宜川、洛川一线，洛河以西亦集结两个师以上。佯攻陇东的二十九师十七师等部已大部东调。十七师四十八旅住西华池受重创后，已调回关中补充。庆阳、合水及西华池均已收复。胡宗南在西安集结一个空军大队，并拟对延安使用伞兵。
    山西蒋军嫡系所剩无几，阎锡山凑合残兵败将发动晋中进攻，十九军副军长于镇河等，率众由祁县、平遥、交城会犯文水，一日在文水城西北郊损失近两团。七十二师师长艾子谦仅以身免，文水城又告收复。
    山东战局，蒋军阵势日益混乱，蒋介石现在正命陈诚“改组山东军事机构，调整并重新配置军事机构部与军队”。（合众社）陈诚在徐州、青岛、济南间手忙脚乱，这位只会下命令叫部下“集中待命相机进攻”的笨伯，越是到处下手，越是弄得乱七八糟！胶济线现在已不成一条线了，青岛、徐县、济南已成三点，而中间一点——潍县更是大海中的孤舟，摇摇欲坠了！津浦线北段的蒋军，亦在彷徨无主中，前无足以解决危局之希望，后有再“换防”之危险。一日至三日，枣庄及其东北之北庄之东南之郭里集，曾一度为解放军收复。沭河以东、临（沂）青（口）公路以北及南侧地区蒋军之被赶走，都是使蒋军苦恼的例子。
    蒋介石吹嘘长春“胜利”，但是东北民主联军于四日又在东线收复济南，旬日来联军已向前推进百余公里。西于六日收复通辽，将大（虎山）通（辽）铁路拦腰切断，联军已打入热东。联军在长春以北地区的反围食战，已告一段落，逐渐撤退至原来防线。蒋介石又连日“捏造战果”，合众社也看到“国民党大事宣传的共军对长春的‘纸上’攻势，一变而为国民党的‘纸上’大胜利”，并且戳穿其目的是想“抵消共军在济南区之胜利”，因为“国民党军事实际际地在鲁中得到应有惩罚”。
    本周内各线人民解放军歼敌万余人，收复县城五座——陕甘宁之庆阳、合水、山东之高密，东北之济南、通辽。主动撤除三座城——满、西安、九台。
