Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 24th: TASS, Baghdad: Truman's message regarding "aid" to Greece and Turkey has been condemned by Arab countries. The Iraqi progressive newspaper sharply criticized Truman, stating: Truman's speech, in effect, means that a major power has violated the boundaries of the United Nations organization and threatens the existence of this organization as a tool for maintaining peace. The newspaper *Saut al-Ahrar* stated: "Truman's speech has caused astonishment among people of the world. His challenge to the United Nations is similar to the challenge of the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan to the League of Nations before the war." The newspaper believes: "Truman is attempting to use the positions occupied by Turkey and Greece to establish new strategic bases for American imperialism." The famous Egyptian writer Taha Hussein wrote in a newspaper article mentioning the consequences of American intervention in the Near East: "The United States hopes not only to spread its political influence on these countries through the dollar, but also by sending technical, economic and military personnel to Greece and Turkey."
