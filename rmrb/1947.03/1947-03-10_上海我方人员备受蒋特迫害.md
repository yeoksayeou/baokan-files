Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai report: The CCP Shanghai Liaison Office was forced to evacuate and suffered threats and persecution from Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, losing their freedom and only able to leave after five days. The situation was as follows: At 10:30 PM on February 28th, an officer from Chiang's Songhu Garrison Command brought a "fast mail telegram" from Xuan Tie-wu to General Zhou Enlai's residence on Ma Si Nan Road, ordering CCP personnel to submit a withdrawal list by March 3rd and leave Shanghai on the 5th. Before the officer had even stepped out the door, the liaison office was surrounded by a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's police and secret agents, claiming they were ordered by the Garrison Command to search the premises, and the telephone lines were immediately cut off, completely depriving CCP personnel of their freedom. During the search, even two publicly sold shortwave radios were confiscated for "safekeeping." At midnight that night, black-clad secret agents came to force Comrade Chen Jiakang, the CCP spokesperson in Shanghai, to immediately hand over the withdrawal list, and all personnel were placed under house arrest. At this time, secret agents confiscated all mail belonging to CCP personnel and prohibited them from reading newspapers. When Chinese and foreign reporters came to visit, they were strictly interrogated and blocked from entering. When Chen Jiakang personally went to open the door, he was violently prevented by the secret agents inside and outside. Under these circumstances, Dong Biwu intended to personally visit Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Garrison Commander Xuan Tie-wu, and Police Chief Yu Shuping to negotiate, but he was also blocked by police and secret agents. Subsequently, he sent a written protest, stating that depriving CCP personnel of their freedom was illegal, but to no avail. On March 2nd, Comrade Dong Biwu once again lodged a serious protest with Xuan Tie-wu, and a withdrawal plan was finally agreed upon. That evening, Dong left by car for Nanjing, having already been deprived of his freedom for forty-eight hours since the evening of February 28th. Unexpectedly, when Dong arrived at Xiaguan in Nanjing the next morning, he was held at gunpoint by Chiang's secret agents and detained for an hour. Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang's barbaric acts against CCP representatives have completely lost their humanity. After Dong protested to Xuan Tie-wu, CCP personnel at the Shanghai office still did not regain their freedom, and their comings and goings were still monitored by Chiang's agents. It was not until 7:00 AM on March 5th that all personnel from the CCP Shanghai Office, Xinhua Daily, and Masses Magazine were escorted by police cars sent by the Garrison Command to the North Station to board a train to Nanjing. At this point, personnel of the CCP Shanghai office were completely forced to evacuate Shanghai.

### 上海我方人员备受蒋特迫害

　　上海我方人员备受蒋特迫害
    【新华社延安八日电】沪讯：此次中共上海联络办事处被迫撤退，备受蒋介石特务恫吓、迫害，失去自由，五日后始得成行。经过情形如下：二月二十八日晚十时半，蒋家淞沪警备司令部派军官一人携宣铁吾致中共联络处“快邮代电”一件，赴马司南路周恩来将军公馆，勒令中共人员于三月三日提出撤退名单，五日离开上海。该军官尚未踏出大门，办事处四周已为大批蒋家警察特务重重包围，口称奉警备司令部命令前来搜查，电话线亦立即被切断，中共人员完全失去自由。搜查时连市面公开出售之长波收音机两具，亦被搜去“代为保管”。当夜十二时，又有黑衣特务来威逼上海中共发言人陈家康同志立刻交出撤退名单，所有人员均被软禁室内；此时特务人员已没收中共人员一切邮件及禁止阅报，中外记者来访俱被严加盘诘，拦阻门外。陈家康亲往开门，均为室内及室外特务暴力阻止。在此情形下，董必武氏拟亲往访晤蒋家上海市长吴国桢、警备司令宣铁吾及警察局长俞叔平交涉，亦遭警察特务阻止。继以书面向其抗议、并说明褫夺中共人员自由系非法行为，亦无结果。三月二日，董必武同志再度向宣铁吾提出严重抗议，始商定撤退办法。当晚董氏乘车赴京，距二月二十八日晚业已失去自由四十八小时；讵料董氏翌日晨抵南京下关时，竟遭蒋帮特务以手枪抵住胸膛，囚禁一小时。国民党蒋介石以此种暴行加于中共代表身上，可谓已完全失去人性。董氏向宣铁吾抗议后，沪办事处中共人员仍未恢复自由，出入会客仍遭蒋特监视；直至五日上午七时，上海中共办事处及新华日报、群众杂志全部人员始被警备部派来警车押解至北站上火车赴南京。至此中共上海办事处人员完全被迫撤离上海。
