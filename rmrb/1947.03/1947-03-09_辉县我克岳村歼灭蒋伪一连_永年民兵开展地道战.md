　　【Our Newspaper Taihang, 7th Dispatch】On the evening of the 4th, the People's Liberation Army counterattacked the puppet army north of Hui (county) and recovered the Yuecun stronghold, annihilating one company of the puppet 12th Corps. More than 40 enemies were killed or wounded, 108 were captured, and six light machine guns, more than 60 rifles, and one telephone were seized. On the 5th, our army attacked Xishicun (north of Shuiye) in Anyang, killing more than 50 people including the head of the "Returning Home Corps," capturing 45 people, and seizing more than 20 rifles.
　　【Our Newspaper Special Dispatch】Tunnels and underground caves have been established in all villages in Yongnian, and the explosion campaign has been widely launched. At dawn on February 3rd, more than 600 enemy puppets from the city invaded the villages of Dongyangzhuang, Xiyangzhuang, and Beikuo north of the city. When the enemy puppets invaded Beikuo Village, the militia hung landmines on the doors and defended the houses, retreating into the underground caves after a half-hour of fierce fighting. As soon as the enemy entered the door, the mine exploded, and they dared not enter the courtyard again. The enemy stepped on fourteen local-made landmines in Dongyangzhuang, resulting in eleven casualties, and they fled back in frustration. The masses suffered no losses.

    【本报特讯】永年各村地道、地洞均已建立，爆炸运动普遍展开。二月三日拂晓，城内敌伪六百余名进犯城北东杨庄、西扬庄、北廓等村。敌伪进北犯廓村时，民兵在门上挂了地雷，上房坚守，激战半小时后退入地洞，敌一进门雷就炸了，不敢再进院里。敌在东杨庄踏乡地雷十四个，伤亡十一名，废然回窜。群众毫无损失。
