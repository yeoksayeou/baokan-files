    【This dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu Front on the 22nd by our reporter Ke Gang:】 To summarize the work achievements of implementing the mass line since the Self-Defense War, and to further carry out the Wang Keqin movement, a certain regiment where Wang Keqin is located convened a meeting of killing-the-enemy heroes and model workers on the 9th. 185 heroes and model workers from various regiments attended the meeting (of which one-third were former KMT soldiers who joined our army after being liberated). Model squads such as Wang Keqin and Zhang Baoyu were invited to attend. The venue was surrounded by colorful statistics and photos of combat achievements. The common people flocked to inspect the glorious achievements of the heroes, and they all said in unison: "Fight on! Our army is getting tougher and tougher. Let's see how many more blows Chiang can take!" Many people, after seeing the Wang Keqin squad and Wang Keqin's picture performed by the cultural troupe, searched for Wang Keqin everywhere. Elementary school students followed Wang Keqin all day long, asking him to tell stories of battles. After heated discussions and full exchange of experiences, the heroes and models selected Wang Keqin, Zhang Baoyu and 58 others as the regiment's first and second class heroes and models. After the political commissar made a concluding report, they formulated personal plans, vowing to annihilate more enemies, defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao, and create thousands of Wang Keqins. The conference lasted for six days and closed on the morning of the 14th with awards.
    【This dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu Front on the 22nd:】 "Whoever can learn from the masses, develop and concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and serve the masses, will have the greatest wisdom." This was the first sentence of the concluding report made by the political commissar of Wang Keqin's regiment at the regiment's heroes' meeting. He emphasized: "Facts have proved that if we want to do all kinds of work well, we must mobilize the broad masses of soldiers and create a mass movement. Since last year, our regiment has gone through three stages of mass movement: pouring out grievances, mutual assistance, and killing-the-enemy emulation. Many leaders such as Wang Keqin emerged during the movement. These people emerged from the masses and promoted the masses, ensuring the completion of the tasks." "Why do we need to specifically carry out the Wang Keqin movement? Because Wang Keqin is the most outstanding on the battlefield." He pointed out that Wang Keqin has four major advantages worth learning: First, he has experience in leading new recruits, patiently educating them, and actively helping them, transforming the timid Bai Zhixue into a fearless warrior. He proved that there are no soldiers who cannot fight, and no people who cannot be reformed. Second, he proposed "Rely on parents at home, rely on mutual assistance in revolution," raising mutual assistance to a theoretical level. Everyone comes up with ideas in marching, fighting, and training, and mutual assistance is done very well. Third, he used the method of introduction to let the soldiers of the liberated areas and the liberated soldiers learn from each other, combining courage and technology. Fourth, he loves the masses, and rescues the common people regardless of danger in the rain of bullets. Finally, he repeatedly said: "Heroes cannot be proud and cannot be divorced from the masses. Whoever does not serve the masses cannot be a hero."

    【This dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu Front on the 22nd:】 Wang Keqin, the well-known killing-the-enemy hero and platoon leader of a certain company, announced his plan to create a model platoon in front of the award platform at the regiment's heroes' meeting on the 14th, saying: 1. In addition to continuing to do a good job in mutual assistance in various tasks, we will also propose to hold heart-to-heart talks at any time under the principle of voluntary combination to achieve a deep understanding between superiors and subordinates and solve problems in a timely manner. Have more individual talks with cadres and less public criticism. 2. Resolutely implement the method of officers and soldiers teaching and learning from each other. Everyone learns to use terrain and terrain features, throws grenades more than 30 meters, and ensures that new soldiers learn to load and unload machine guns and troubleshoot within ten weeks. 3. Ensure that the terrain is well scouted and the fire team is well organized so that everyone can move under enemy fire. 4. Do a good job in mass work, publicize when entering and exiting, and do not enter houses that have not been vacated. Understand and respect the customs and habits of the masses, and implement the "full jar movement." Select two people from each squad to carry out propaganda work every day. Check discipline when leaving and make compensation. Hold regular meetings with landlords. After the plan was read out, the heroes were inspired. Dozens of heroes and models such as Chen Ziying immediately stood up and proposed a competition with Wang Keqin, and the mood was extremely enthusiastic.

    王克勤所在旅召开群英大会
    总结执行群众路线成绩
    选出一二等英雄模范六十名
    王克勤宣布创造模范排计划
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十二日电】本报记者柯岗报导：前线某部王克勤所在旅，为总结自卫战争以来执行群众路线的工作成绩，进一步开展王克勤运动，特于九日召开杀敌英雄模范工作者大会，到会各团英雄、模范一百八十五人（内原为蒋军士兵被解放后参加我军者占三分之一），王克勤、张保玉等模范班，全体被邀列席。会场环布彩色作战功绩统计和照片，老百姓成群结队争相检阅英雄们的辉煌功绩，他们异口同声的说：“打吧，咱队伍越打越硬，看老蒋还能打几下！”许多群众看到文工团演出的王克勤班和王克勤像片之后，到处寻找王克勤。小学生们整天跟着王克勤，要他讲战斗故事。英雄模范经热烈座谈，充分交流经验后，选出王克勤、张保玉等六十人为全旅一、二等英雄模范，他们并于政治委员作总结报告后，订出个人计划，誓为歼灭更多敌人，保卫党中央、保卫毛主席、创造千百个王克勤而奋斗，大会历时六日，于十四日晨给奖闭幕。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十二日电】“谁能向群众学习，把群众的智慧发扬起来、集中起来，为群众服务，谁就有最大的智慧。”这是王克勤所在旅的政委在该旅群英大会上作总结报告时的头一句话。他着重指出：“事实证明，各种工作要想作好，必须发动广大士兵群众，造成群众运动。我旅从去年以来，有过诉苦、互助和杀敌竞赛等三个群众运动的阶段，运动中产生了王克勤等许多带头人，这些人从群众中涌出来，又推动了群众，保证了任务的完成。”“为什么要专门开展王克勤运动呢？是因为王克勤在战场是最出色的一个。”他指出王克勤有四大优点值得大家学习：第一、有带新兵的经验，耐心教育，积极帮助，把胆小的白志学改造成无畏的勇士。他证明了没有不能打仗的战士，没有不能改造的人。第二、他提出“在家靠父母，革命靠互助”，把互助提到理论的高度，在行军作战练兵中，大家想办法，互助搞的很好。第三、他用介绍的办法，让解放区战士和被解放战士互助学习，把勇敢和技术结合起来。第四、他爱护群众，在枪林弹雨中不顾危险救护老百姓。最后他再三的说：“英雄是不能骄傲、不能脱离群众的，谁要不为群众服务，谁就不能当英雄。”

    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十二日电】著明杀敌英雄某连排长王克勤十四日于该旅群英大会授奖台前宣布他创造模范排计划称：一、除继续作好各种工作的互助外，并提出在自愿结合的原则下，随时开谈心会，达到上下彼此之间的深刻了解，及时解决问题。对干部多作个别谈话，少当众批评。二、坚决执行官兵互教互学办法。人人学会利用地形地物，投弹在三十公尺以上，保证新战士十星期内学会装卸机枪，排除故障。三、保证看好地形，组好火方，使每人都能在敌火力下运动。四、群众工作做到进出宣传，没有腾好的房子不进去。了解并尊重群众风俗习惯，执行“满缸运动”。每班选出两人，每天进行宣传工作。走时检查纪律，进行赔偿。定期召开房东会。这一计划宣读后，群英振奋，陈子英等数十英雄模范当即起立向王克勤提出竞赛，情绪至为热烈。
