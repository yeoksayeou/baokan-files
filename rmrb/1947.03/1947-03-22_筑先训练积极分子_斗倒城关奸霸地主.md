    [Reported by this newspaper, Jilu Yu on the 20th] After the Han traitor landlord Ding Qingao in the Chengguan District of Zhuxian (Liaocheng) was struggled against, the peasant association organization in the village rapidly expanded. Ding Qingao's son used to work in the puppet police station. Relying on the power of the Han traitors, he bullied and extorted from the masses, and exploited more than 270 mu of land. After our army recovered Zhuxian, the masses launched anti-traitorous accusations, and when settling accounts with the evil landlord, Ding Qingao attempted to evade the struggle. He secretly convened a meeting of the puppet Bao and Jia heads, deciding to have the poor peasant Liu Hanchen be the chairman of the peasant association; and sent his confidant Xu Shangyi with two dou of corn to Liu Hanchen, saying, "You do it, you won't lose out. If you have any difficulties, I will help you solve them. If the 'Central' army comes again, I guarantee you'll be a good person." Liu Hanchen was temporarily used by him. After Ding Qingao was detained by the democratic county government, the masses had not yet divided his ill-gotten wealth, Liu Hanchen secretly hid some soft goods, and then hypocritically went to the district to propose to divide Ding's things, in order to release Ding, but did not get permission from the district. When the county held an activist training class, Liu Hanchen also participated in the training and understood the crimes of evil landlords exploiting and oppressing the poor, and became enlightened. So he confessed to everyone about being used by Ding, and said: "Whoever protects Ding's things again is not human." He reported the stored items on the spot, and then won over Xu Shangyi, explaining that "poor people should care for other poor people, turning back is the right thing to do." After the training, the activists in Qiancaishi returned and immediately convened a mass struggle meeting for the entire street. All the peasants rose up and overthrew the Han traitor Ding Qingao and ten bad landlords. After the meeting, the number of peasant association members increased by more than 50, and women and children's organizations expanded, with more than 90 percent of households participating in the organization.

    筑先训练积极分子
    斗倒城关奸霸地主
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】筑先（聊城）城关区汉奸地主丁钦告被斗后，该村农会组织就急剧扩大起来。丁钦告儿子从前在伪警察所做事，他仗恃汉奸势力，欺压讹敲群众，剥削得来二百七十多亩地。我军收复筑先后，群众开展反奸诉苦，向恶霸地主算账时，丁钦告企图逃避斗争，便先暗地召开伪保甲长会议，决定叫贫民刘汉臣当农会会长；并派亲信许尚义送二斗玉米，给刘汉臣说：“你干吧，亏不着你。有啥困难帮你解决，若“中央”军再来了，我保你是好人。”刘汉臣一时被他利用，当丁钦告被民主县府扣押后，群众还没分他的浮财，刘汉臣暗中先把一些细软东西掩藏起来，便虚伪的到区里提出要分丁的东西，以便把丁放出，但没有得到区里允许。县里办积极分子训练班时，刘汉臣也参加受训，明白恶霸地主剥削压迫穷人的罪恶，觉悟过来。于是把受丁利用的事情向大家表明，并表示：“谁要再给老丁掩护东西，不算人。”他当场报告了存放的东西，接着又争取许尚义，说明“穷人顾穷人回头是好人。”训练结束后，前菜市的积极分子回去即召开全街群众斗争大会。全体农民起来斗倒了汉奸丁钦告及十家坏地主。会后农会会员增加了五十多，妇女儿童组织扩大，百分之九十以上户都参加了组织。
