    Enhance Class Consciousness, Unleash Creativity:
    Artillery Training Team Innovates Drills
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The military region's artillery training team has launched a wave of study. Liberated soldiers and officers enhanced class consciousness and worked together to create new drills. During the Self-Defense War, our army captured a lot of American weapons. In order to use these new weapons, an artillery training team was established. When the team was first established, the ideological situation of the soldiers (liberated KMT army officers and soldiers of the 10th artillery regiment accounted for 50 percent) was very chaotic. It was only after three weeks of class education and speaking bitterness movements that it was clarified and unified. All the liberated officers and soldiers deeply reflected on the inhuman treatment and deceptive propaganda they had suffered in the Kuomintang army after being conscripted. They realized that they were the oppressed and exploited class, and that the leader who had oppressed and deceived them in the past was Chiang Kai-shek. They unanimously demanded revenge on this greatest enemy. For example, before speaking bitterness, liberated soldier Ding Ji'an believed that Chiang Kai-shek could not be defeated, that his soldiers could not be eliminated, and that his weapons could not be exhausted. During the speaking bitterness session, he cried and shouted: "I am Wang Dongcai in 'blood and tears of hatred', my father is Wang Renhou. But I have not yet been reunited with them, nor have I obtained revenge. I want revenge!" Cao Xingshun said: "Only by learning your skills well can you serve the people and avenge yourself!"
    Now the whole team has been swept into a wave of learning technology. Military and political cadres guide on the one hand, and join the ranks of learning on the other. The learning method focuses on mutual assistance and inspiring the creativity of the masses. When learning the names of the various parts of the cannon, in addition to other drills, people are often crowded on the cannon, studying each other, and they can recite them fluently during evening discussions. Squad leader Zhao Tianze wrote the names of the various parts of the cannon on the blackboard in the squad in order, to combine it with cultural studies. Other subjects, such as the components of the cannon and the positions of the gunners, are also drawn on the blackboards in each squad to facilitate indoor learning. Originally, some of the American-style operations often resulted in head collisions, which were chaotic and not applicable. Squad leader Lu Qingxian set up a wooden cannon in the courtyard using benches and shovels for the whole squad to study in order to improve this drill. As a result, he and soldier Wang Wenbin created a new "gunner positioning" operation method, which is better than the American operation method. Squad leader Wu Qiyi also created a new "cannon retraction" action, which has now been promoted to all squads, overcoming the shortcomings of the American operation method, and breaking the idea that the "model order" is an unchangeable "golden rule".
    Other aspects of military life are very tense. They get up before dawn to sweep the streets. The entire village is cleaned up by the time the reveille sounds. When assembling, they are already standing in formation on the parade ground as soon as the signal drops. During operations, there is no need for cadres to give orders to adjust their steps, and they can automatically maintain the neatness of the ranks. (Wang Wenzhi)

    提高阶级自觉发挥创造性
    炮兵训练队创新操法
    【本报特讯】军区炮兵训练队掀起学习热潮，被解放官兵提高阶级自觉，一致努力，创造新操法。自卫战争的过程中，我军曾缴获了不少的美式武器，为了利用这些新武器，开办了炮兵训练队。该队刚成立时，战士（解放蒋军炮十团官兵占百分之五十）思想状况很紊乱，在经过了三周的阶级教育及诉苦运动后，才得到了澄清和统一。所有的被解放官兵深刻的反省到被抓丁后在国民党军队中所受的非人待遇及欺骗宣传，都认识到自己是被压迫被剥削的阶级，过去压迫和欺骗他们的头子就是蒋介石，一致要求向这个最大的敌人复仇。如解放战士丁吉安在诉苦之先，认为蒋介石是打不垮的，他的兵员是消灭不完的，武器是抛不光的。在诉苦时，他痛哭流涕的呼出：“我就是‘血泪仇’中的王栋材，我父亲就是王仁厚。可是我还没有像他们一样的得到团圆，得到复仇，我要复仇！”曹兴顺说：“学好自己的本事，才能为人民服务，为自己报仇！”
    现在全队已卷入学习技术的热潮，军政干部一面指导，一面入列学习。学习方法着重互助及启发群众的创造性，在学习炮之各部名称时，除了其他操课外，炮上经常拥挤着人，互相研究，晚上讨论都能背诵烂熟。四班长赵田泽则在班里的小黑板上，把炮的各部名称依次写出，以结合文化课的学习。其他课目如炮之组件及炮手的位置等也画在各班的小黑板上，以便室内学习。原来美式的操作，有些动作操作起来时常碰头，既紊乱又不适用，四班长陆清贤为了改良这个操法，在院子里用长凳和铁锹等架起一个木炮来，供全班研究。结果与战士王文斌创立出“炮手定位”的新操作法，比美式操法好，五班长吴其议也创立了新的“收炮”动作，现都推及各班，克服了美式操法的缺点，打破了认为“典范令”是不可更变的“金科玉律”的思想。
    其他在军事生活上非常紧张，未明即起，打扫街道，起床号时全村打扫完毕，集合时信号一落已在操场中站好队，在操作中不需干部口令调整步伐，都能自动保持行列的整齐。  （王文治）
