    Standards for Class Division

    Comrade Shen Yi: Regarding your question about class division, here is a brief reply: The amount of land is not the only standard for determining class composition. Due to the complexity of Chinese society, each class has a particularly large number of strata and types. Generally speaking, there are four important standards for class division. The first is the relationship of exploitation, which is a primary and fundamental standard for dividing strata. To determine what class a household belongs to, it is necessary to first understand its production relationship with others: whether it exploits others, is exploited by others, or neither exploits nor is exploited. The second is the means of production, such as land, cattle, farm tools, and fertilizers in rural areas. The presence or absence and the amount of these means of production can be used as a standard for class division. The third is the regular living situation, which mainly includes clothing, food, and housing, while also considering its ratio to the size of the population and the general standard of living at the time and place. Fourth, understand the current foundation and historical development of the household, its past position in the production relationship, and the reasons for changes in the possession of means of livelihood. As for the detailed classification of rural classes, please refer to the article "Regulations of the Taihang District Party Committee on Standards and Specific Division of Rural Classes" published on the second page of this newspaper on January 24th. Regarding the families you asked about, only the amount of land is mentioned, and other conditions are not understood, so it is difficult to give a definite answer as to which class or stratum they belong to.

    Can the Swing Game Be Abolished?

    Comrade Wang Qingyuan: Your suggestion to abolish the swing game in rural areas to avoid the danger of people falling and getting hurt shows your concern for the safety of the masses, which is very good. However, the swing is a traditional and widespread game in China with a long history and a mass character. It is both entertaining and good for physical and mental exercise, so the masses in various places enjoy playing this game very much. It is a good phenomenon, and it is not good to abolish it, and in fact, it cannot be abolished. As for the possibility of danger, this can be avoided. Various places can put more fine soil or soft sand under the swing frame, and those who do not know how to swing should not be forced to go up to swing.

    划分阶级的标准
    沈毅同志：你问划分阶级的问题，简复如下：阶级成份的划定，土地的多寡不是惟一的标准，由于我们中国社会的复杂性，使各阶级都有着特别多的阶层和类型。一般的说：划分阶级有四个重要的标准，第一是剥削关系，这是一个主要的，同时也是基本的划分阶层的标准，要判某一户是什么阶级，必先了解清楚他与别人的生产关系。是剥削人的还是被人剥削的，还是既不剥削人也不被人剥削的。第二是生产手段，如在农村即指土地、耕牛、农具和肥料等而言，这些生产手段的有无与多少，都可作为划分阶级的一种标准。第三是经常的生活情况，他所包含的主要内容是衣食住三项，并同时顾到它与人口多少的比例，当时当地一般的生活水平等。第四了解该户现在基础和历史发展情形，过去在生产关系中的地位，生活手段的占有以后变化的原因。至于农村阶级的详细划法，请参看本报一月二十四日二版所载《太行区党委关于农村阶级划分标准与具体划分的规定》一文。你问的几家，只说明了土地的多少，不了解其它诸条件，故很难肯定的答复属于何种阶级或阶层。
    秋千游戏能废除吗？
    王庆元同志：你提议废除农村中的秋千游戏，以免发生跌坏人的危险，这种关心群众的安危之热情是很好的。不过秋千这种游戏，是我们中国历史悠久最普遍最群众性的一种游戏，既可娱乐，又可运动身心，所以各地群众多乐于作这种游戏，是很好的现象，废除了不好，而且实际上也是废除不了的。至于容易发生危险，这是可以避免的，各地可于秋千架下多垫些细土或柔沙，不会打秋千的人，不要勉强硬拖上去打就行。
    我国各省市的简称
    李玉生同志：你说不知道我国扣省市的简称，看报很困难，现将各省市简称开列如下：江苏省简称苏省，南京市简称京，上海市简称沪。浙江省简称浙省，杭州市简称杭。安徽省简称皖省。江西省简称赣。湖北省简称鄂，武昌、汉口、汉阳简称武汉或汉。湖南省简称湘。四川省简称蜀或川，重庆市简称渝，成都市简称蓉。河北省简称冀，北平市简称平，天津市简称津。山东省简称东。山西省简称晋。河南省简称豫，开封市简称汴。陕西省简称陕。甘肃省简称陇或甘。宁夏简称宁。福建省简称闽。广东省简称粤。广西省简称桂。云南省简称滇。贵州省简称黔。辽宁省简称辽。吉林省简称吉。黑龙江省简称黑。（现东三省已改为九省尚无简称。）热河省简称热。新疆省简称新。察哈尔省简称察。绥远省简称绥。西藏省简称藏。其它青海、西康等省无简称。
