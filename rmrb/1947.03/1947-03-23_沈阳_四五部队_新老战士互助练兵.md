"Shenyang" 4-5 Unit
New and Veteran Soldiers Help Each Other in Military Training

[Our newspaper, Taihang, 21st dispatch] When the "Shenyang" 4-5 Unit attacked the Zhi Lu He blockhouse, the hero of killing the enemy, Su Fuhong's platoon, achieved a complete annihilation of an enemy platoon at a slight cost. After the leadership praised and disseminated this victory, everyone deeply realized that the improvement of tactics and techniques was the main factor for small casualties and great victories. The Liang Bangrong mutual aid group automatically arranged learning, and the 5th company automatically built blockhouses in preparation for assault drills. The 43rd unit got up early and went to bed late, and practiced bayonet fighting even under the moonlight, which has become a common phenomenon. The military skills of the newly replenished liberated soldiers are immediately respected by commanders and fighters. A new comrade in the 5th company performed very well in a drill, and the battalion commander immediately praised him and asked everyone to learn from him. The mutual aid movement between new and veteran soldiers is rapidly developing. In the inspection of the meritorious service plan, the 48th unit has formulated a military training plan. Based on everyone's discussion, the Wang Tianfu squad has also formulated specific methods for practicing bayonet fighting. Initially, no one in the first and second platoons of the 48th unit could jump over the vaulting horse. After half an afternoon of hard training, six comrades were able to jump over it that day. In the afternoon of the second day, the 2nd company threw grenades. Comrade Ding Renxiu, a machine gunner in the 2nd platoon, created a record of 47 meters. Another soldier, Zhang Shan, also threw 46 meters, and both were very accurate. The wooden grenades thrown weighed one and a half catties.

    【本报太行二十一日电】“沈阳”四五部队打直路河碉堡时，杀敌英雄苏福红排以轻微代价换得完全歼灭敌人一个排的胜利，经过领导上表扬传播，大家深深体会到战术技术提高，乃伤亡小而胜利大的主要因素。梁邦荣互助组自动布置学习，五连自动修设碉堡准备演习攻坚，四三部队早起晚睡，月亮地里还要练习刺杀，已经成为普遍现象。最近补充的新解放战士的军事技术，立刻为指战员们所尊重。五连一位新同志演习动作很好，营首长即刻表扬，并让大家学习。新老战士的互助运动正迅速开展。四八部队在检查立功计划中，已订出练兵计划，王天福班根据大家讨论的结果，还订出练习白刃扑搏的具体办法。四八部队开始一、二排没有一个人能跳过木马，经过半下午苦练，当天即有六个同志跳过。二连在第二天下午打手榴弹，二排机枪班战士丁任修同志，创造了四十七米的纪录。另一战士张山也打到四十六米，而且都很准确，所投木弹为一斤半重。
