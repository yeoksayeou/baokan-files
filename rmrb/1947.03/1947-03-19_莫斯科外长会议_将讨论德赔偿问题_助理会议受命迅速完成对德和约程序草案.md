　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Moscow dispatch: The Foreign Ministers Conference adjourned on the 16th and is scheduled to reconvene today at 4 p.m. to discuss the issue of German reparations.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Moscow dispatch: At the Foreign Ministers Conference on the 15th, chaired by Marshall, the Foreign Ministers decided, based on Molotov's proposal, to hear the work reports of the Foreign Ministers' Assistants. Vyshinsky, representing the Assistants, reported that the Assistants had prepared a draft procedure for the German peace treaty and had discussed in detail the French plan to establish an Allied Intelligence Advisory Committee. An agreement had been reached on this issue, namely, that the conference would be attended by the four major powers and countries neighboring Germany, as well as countries that had participated in the war against Germany. The task of the committee was also agreed upon. However, disagreements arose during the discussion of the committee's specific composition. The U.S. and British representatives opposed the inclusion of an Albanian representative in the committee, while the Soviet representative insisted on this, supported by the French representative. After a brief exchange of views on the working procedures of the Assistants' Conference, the Foreign Ministers accepted Molotov's proposal, which suggested that the Assistants' Conference continue its work, while the Foreign Ministers would review this contentious issue within a reasonable period of time. Bidault believed that the discussion on the composition of the Intelligence Advisory Committee would not be prolonged, as this issue affected many countries. The Foreign Ministers then decided to instruct the Foreign Ministers' Assistants to submit a report on the preparation of German peace treaty procedures by March 20th. Subsequently, the Foreign Ministers also discussed the issue of displaced persons, referring to people of various countries who had been forcibly abducted to Germany or to German-occupied countries during the war. During the discussion, Bidault and Bevin both expressed their views.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Moscow dispatch: At the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference on the 12th, the issue of the number of German prisoners of war held by Germany was raised. When the Foreign Ministers held their fifth meeting at 4 p.m. on the 14th, they continued to exchange official materials on this issue. France currently has 630,000 German prisoners of war, of which 500,000 are being used for France's economic recovery. There are still 890,000 prisoners of war in Soviet territory, and one million have been repatriated to Germany from the Soviet Union since Germany's surrender.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Moscow dispatch: The Austrian issue Foreign Ministers' Assistants met on the 14th to discuss one of the most important issues of the Austrian peace treaty: German assets in Austria. The four-nation delegation of the German Assets Committee in Austria presented their respective proposals on this issue at the meeting. Soviet representative Gusev stated that the three heads of state had made a clear resolution on this issue at the Berlin Conference, and the Soviet delegation insisted on this resolution. No new four-nation agreement is needed on the issue of transferring German assets. The Austrian government has not, in practice, acknowledged the resolutions of the Berlin Conference to this day. In view of this, the Austrian peace treaty should stipulate in detail that the Austrian government must recognize the four powers' privileged right as occupying powers to extradite all assets and be responsible for taking necessary measures to suppress the transfer of such assets. British representative, De, and U.S. representative, Clarke, continued to speak, attempting to deny the four powers' legitimate rights to the aforementioned German assets. This issue was not resolved at the end of the meeting.

　　莫斯科外长会议
    将讨论德赔偿问题
    助理会议受命迅速完成对德和约程序草案
    【新华社延安十七日电】莫斯科讯：外长会议于十六日休会，定今日下午四时复会讨论德国赔偿问题。
    【新华社延安十七日电】莫斯科讯：十五日之外长会议由马歇尔任主席，根据莫洛托夫的建议，各外长决定听取外长助理的工作报告，维辛斯基代表助理会议报告工作声称：助理会议已准备了德国和约的程序草案，曾详细讨论了法国的计划，即组织盟国情报咨询委员会问题，此一问题已获致协议，即该会议由四强及邻近德国的国家与参加过对德作战的国家参加，该会之任务亦获致协议，惟在讨论该会之具体组成时，发生异议，美英代表反对阿尔巴尼亚代表加入该会，苏代表则坚持此举，且得法代表之支持。各外长关于助理会议工作程序作短时间交换意见后，接受了莫洛托夫的建议，莫氏建议助理会议继续工作，外长会议则在相当时间内审议此一存有争执之问题。比道尔认为关于情报咨询会议组成问题之讨论不会迁延过久，盖此问题影响许多国家，外长会议遂决定指令外长助理于三月二十日呈交准备德国和约程序的报告。此后各外长尚讨论了无家可归者的问题，所谓无家可归者，即指在战争期间被强力诱拐至德国或诱拐至德国占领国家的各国人民而言。在讨论中，比道尔与贝文都发表了意见。
    【新华社延安十六日电】莫斯科讯：十二日之四强外长会议上曾提出了德国国家之德国战俘数目问题，十四日下午四时各外长举行第五次会议时，继续对此问题交换了官方材料，法国现有德国战俘六十三万人，其中五十万人被用于法国的经济恢复上，在苏联领土内现在尚有战俘八十九万人，自德国投降后已有一百万人自苏遣送回德。
    【新华社延安十六日电】莫斯科讯：奥国问题外长助理于十四日集会讨论对奥国和约中最重要问题之一的德国在奥资产问题，奥境德国资产委员会之四国代表团，在会议上对此问题提出了各自的建议。苏代表古赛夫称：三国首脑在柏林会议上对此问题已有明确决议，苏代表团坚持这一决议，关于过渡德国资产问题不需要新的四国协议，奥政府在实际上至今不承认柏林会议的决议。有鉴于此，对奥和约应详细订阅奥政府必需承认四强具有特权占领国的引渡一切资产，并负责采取必要措施镇压迁移此种资产。英代表、德及美代表克拉克继续发言，他们企图否认四强于上述德国资产的合法权利，在会议结束时这一问题未获协议。
