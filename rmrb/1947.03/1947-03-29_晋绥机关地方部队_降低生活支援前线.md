    Jin-Sui Region Authorities and Local Troops
    Reduce Living Standards to Support the Front Lines
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 25th] The authorities and local troops in the Jin-Sui Border Region are universally implementing austerity measures and increasing production to support the front lines. It has been decided to eliminate work-related expenses and the small mess halls. Food rations for Party, government, and civilian organizations will be reduced by half, and those for local troops by a quarter, while improving the living standards of field armies and the wounded. Officer uniforms will be eliminated. Except for cadres and soldiers below the company level and miscellaneous personnel, no single-layer or cotton-padded clothing will be issued this year. Orderlies will be abolished, as well as guard personnel and livestock of units below the county level. Except for draft animals distributed to poor farmers for production, mules and horses will be organized into transportation teams by districts to serve the front lines. Economic democracy will be implemented, and the household affairs of troops, organizations, and individuals will be examined and all resources will be used to support mass production. Personnel of various troops and organizations should engage in production, achieving self-sufficiency in vegetables, meat, and daily necessities.
