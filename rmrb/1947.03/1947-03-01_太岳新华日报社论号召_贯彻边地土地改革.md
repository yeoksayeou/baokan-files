Taiyue, 25th (From Our Newspaper) Today, the *Taiyue Xinhua Daily* published an editorial entitled "Implement Land Reform in Border Areas," which stated: The movement of the masses in the border areas, holding guns in one hand and distributing land in the other, has already begun in a few regions. However, the majority of the border areas are still in the stage of opposing counter-settlement or mobilization. Therefore, in addition to striving for the complete completion of land reform in areas where it is already close to completion, the struggle to carry out land reform in the border areas along the Tongpu Railway and the Yellow River has become the main task in striving for the universal completion of "land to the tiller" throughout the region. It continued: Since the beginning of the new year, the continued development of mass movements in counties such as Jiyuan, Linfen, and Lingshi has swept away the idea that "land reform cannot be implemented" in the border areas, proving that the masses in the border areas are equally eager for land. However, the main concern of the masses in the border areas is the idea of "changing the sky" (i.e., fearing the return of the Kuomintang). "The weather is still uncertain," and "the time is not yet ripe"; this is the ideological hurdle to overcome in opening up the situation. Therefore, to mobilize the masses in the border areas, it is necessary to vigorously carry out current affairs propaganda and education, using the advanced ideas of the masses to enlighten some of the backward ideas of the masses, and using facts that the masses have seen or can understand to illustrate the greatness of the unity of strength; especially the "Four Alls Policy" (kill all, burn all, loot all, destroy all) implemented by the Chiang Kai-shek's army everywhere, allows the masses to realize from their painful experience that only struggle can lead to survival. For example, the masses in Qiaoli, Linfen, initially refused to carry out land reform, using the excuse that "an eight-斗 (dǒu) jar cannot hold one 石 (dàn)". Later, after holding a "Situation Analysis Meeting" and using the facts of the Kuomintang army's atrocities witnessed by the masses to arouse the masses' struggle and confidence, the movement immediately unfolded. The masses in the border areas of Lingshi put forward the idea of "uprooting big trees," pointing out the direction of the mass movement for the entire border area, that is, in the land reform movement in the border areas, the focus should be on attacking the worst treacherous despotic landlords, and appropriate care should be given to law-abiding small and medium landlords. The scope of attack should be narrow, the scope of fruit distribution should be wide, the vast majority should be united, and the morale of the masses should be consolidated. In terms of struggle methods, it is necessary to seize the opportunity and act quickly, "things should be done urgently, and food should be eaten hot," which is the correct method put forward by the masses based on the characteristics of the border area situation. The editorial called on the local armed forces, guerrillas, militiamen, and cadres at all levels in the border areas to perform meritorious service for the people in the land reform in the border areas and to launch a meritorious service movement. The local armed forces and militiamen should actively attack, encircle, and intercept the enemy, and implement joint village defense to cover the masses' liquidation. Leading cadres should especially have the determination to share life and death with the masses, live and fight with the masses; therefore, units or individuals who share life and death with the masses and actively cover and lead the masses to turn themselves around should be encouraged and commended, while individuals who are fearful and run away should be subject to due criticism or punishment.

　　太岳新华日报社论号召
    贯彻边地土地改革
    【本报太岳二十五日电】太岳新华日报今日以“贯彻边沿区的土地改革”发表社论略谓：边沿区群众一手拿枪一手分田的运动，已在少数地区展开，但大部边沿区仍停留在反倒算或动员阶段，因此今后除在已接近完成土地改革的地区不骄不懈力求彻底完成外，在同蒲沿线与黄河沿岸的边区地带开展土地改革的斗争，成为争取在全区范围内普遍完成耕者有其田的主要任务。继称：新年以来，济源、临汾、灵石等县群运的继续展开，使边沿区“不能实行土地改革”的思想为之一扫，证明边沿区群众同样迫切要求土地。但边沿区群众有顾虑的主要是“变天”思想。“天气还不知是阴是晴”，“时候还不到哩”；这便是打开局面的思想关口。因此发动边沿区群众必须大力进行时事宣传教育，拿群众中的先进思想以启发群众中的某些落后思想，拿群众亲眼看见或可能理解的事实来说明团结力量的伟大；尤其是蒋军到处实行“四光政策”，使群众从惨痛的经验中认识到只有斗争才能生存的真理。如临汾乔李群众开始对土地改革借口推说：“八斗的瓮装不了一石”，后来经过开“看时势会”，用群众亲眼看见的蒋军暴行事实激起群众斗争与信心，运动便随即展开。灵石边沿区群众在斗争中提出“挖大树”，为全边沿区群运指出了斗争的方向，即是在边沿区土地改革运动中应集中打击最坏的奸霸地主，对安分守己的中小地主应予以适当的照顾。打击面窄分配果实面宽，团结绝大多数，巩固群众情绪。在斗争方法上要抓紧火候，快斗快分，“事要急办，饭要热吃”，就是群众根据边沿区形势的特点而提出的正确办法。社论中号召边沿区的地方武装、游击队、民兵及各级干部，要在边沿区土地改革中为民立功，展开立功运动。地方武装及民兵积极的出击围困阻击敌人，实行联村联防以掩护群众清算，领导干部尤应有与群众同生死共患难的决心，与群众一块生活，一块战斗；因此对于与群众同生死积极掩护领导群众翻身的单位或个人，应予鼓励与嘉奖，个别畏俱逃跑的人，则应受到应有的批评或处分。
