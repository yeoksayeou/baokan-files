    Lebanese Newspapers
    Denounce Truman's Aggressive Policy
    [Our Dispatch] TASS, Beirut, March 20th: Lebanese newspapers sharply criticized Truman's speech before a joint session of the U.S. Congress. The newspaper *Al-Kaidouf*, under the title "Only Imperialists Praise Truman," wrote: "World public opinion mostly believes that Truman's speech marks a new trend in American policy, leading the world into a new war for the purposes of profiteering, domination, and expansion. Only warmongers like Churchill and his imperialist lackeys have expressed great joy at Truman's speech." The newspaper *Zohair* wrote: Truman's announcement to send American military and civilian personnel to Turkey and Greece will determine the policies of the governments of these two countries, dictate the way of life they must adhere to, and constitute direct interference in the internal affairs of these two small countries. Never, anywhere, has a politician so openly interfered in the internal affairs of independent countries.

    黎巴嫩报纸
    抨击杜鲁门侵略政策
    【本报讯】塔斯社贝鲁特二十日电：黎巴嫩报纸尖锐抨击杜鲁门在美国国会参众两院联席会上之演说。《亚尔卡道夫》报以《只有帝国主义者才称赞杜鲁门》为题写道：“世界舆论大都认为杜鲁门之演说，标志着美国政策之新倾向，为了渔利、统治及扩张之目的，而将世界导入新的战争中。只有像邱吉尔及其帝国主义喽罗们一类的战争贩子，才对杜鲁门之演说表示极大之欣喜。”《佐日尔》报写道：杜鲁门宣布派遣美国军事及文职人员赴土耳其及希腊，将决定该两国政府之政策、规定彼等必须依附的生活方式，并构成对该两小国内政之直接干涉。不论何时何地，绝没有一个政治家如此公开的干涉独立国家之内政。
