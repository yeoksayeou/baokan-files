    Collection Group Leaders Report Mid-Month Results
    Shi Zhenming Promotes Textiles
    [Our paper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] Shi Zhenming convened a meeting of twenty-one textile group leaders within the Joint Brigade on the 7th, reporting on the textile achievements of the past month and a half. The twenty-one groups, comprising one hundred and fifteen women, spun a total of four hundred and thirty-two jin of thread and wove one thousand six hundred and eighty-seven chi of cloth. After deducting costs, a profit of four hundred and eighteen thousand one hundred yuan was made. After hearing everyone's reports, Shi Zhenming excitedly encouraged everyone, saying, "Before planting, we must do a good job of spinning and weaving. The more we spin and weave, the better. When it's time to plant, we will go to the fields and do a good job of farming. We must all learn to be all-rounders."
