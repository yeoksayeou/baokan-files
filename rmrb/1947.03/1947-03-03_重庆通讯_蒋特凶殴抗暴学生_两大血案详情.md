Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 26th: Chongqing Dispatch: Recently in Chongqing, two major tragedies occurred in succession where Kuomintang secret agents savagely beat anti-tyranny students. Over seventy students were beaten and injured, with twenty severely wounded. On the 5th of this month, the Anti-American Atrocity Association's propaganda team, in order to go deep into the rural areas, sent over forty male and female students across the river to Jiangbei to conduct propaganda work. At 1 PM in the afternoon, they performed the street play "American Atrocities" in Jiangbei Park Square, with crowds of up to 6,000 people watching. Suddenly, more than ten Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in military uniforms and over two hundred plainclothes secret agent thugs carrying bricks, stones, and clubs rushed into the square, completely destroying the students' propaganda flags, floats, and pictures. The students and the masses rose up to stop them, but to no avail. The students then joined hands and shouted "Chinese people don't hit Chinese people," and went forward. The inhuman secret agents took the opportunity to grab and beat them indiscriminately, with groups of ten or so surrounding one or two students and beating them severely. Bricks, stones, tables, chairs, and clubs flew all over the place. The female students' woolen sweaters and blue cloth clothes were stripped off or torn, and steel cotton coats were snatched away. Two female students had their shoes taken off by the secret agents and were subjected to all sorts of insults. Seven people were severely injured on the spot, and more than twenty were slightly injured. Among them, male student Wang Jinbo was the most seriously injured and was in critical condition; another student, Li Xi, was surrounded and beaten up to six times, until he lay on the beach unable to move. Many female students were protected by the common people into their homes, but were still dragged out and beaten by the secret agents. Many students, under the escort of the common people, managed to cross the river.

    After the tragedy occurred, it shocked the million citizens of Chongqing, who unanimously roared "Protest against the Kuomintang Secret Agents." They brought fruits to the hospital to comfort and care for the injured students, and letters and telegrams of condolence from all sides came like snowflakes. On the morning of the 7th, over a hundred representatives of the "Anti-Alliance" organized a petition team to march in formation, petitioning Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing Provisional Headquarters and the Municipal Government. This team, filled with tragic and angry emotions, shouted slogans such as "Cancel the secret service organization," "Guarantee personal freedom," and "Severely punish the perpetrators of the tragedy" along the way, and passersby applauded in sympathy.

    The students presented four demands to Chiang Kai-shek's Provisional Headquarters: (1) Severely punish the perpetrators and investigate responsibility; (2) Compensate for all losses; (3) Guarantee the organization of the Anti-Alliance and the safety of the students; (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. The representative of the Provisional Headquarters verbally accepted the students' demands, but the representative of the Municipal Government alternately accepted and overturned them, repeating this up to three times, and finally, under the righteous indignation of the masses and the pressure of the students, agreed to the students' demands. Unexpectedly, the words were still ringing in their ears when an even bigger bloodshed occurred on the 8th.

    On the morning of the 8th, two hundred and twelve students from the "Anti-Alliance" propaganda brigade set out from Shangqingsi to conduct propaganda. While passing Xilukou, a person claiming to be the section chief of the Political Department of the Garrison Command followed the brigade, forcing the propaganda team to tell him the propaganda route before leaving. When the propaganda reached Datong Road, suddenly three trucks, one carrying a military officer in military uniform, rammed into the student ranks from behind, disrupting the student formation. At this time, military personnel in military uniforms, pre-positioned at the front of the team, signaled with whistles and shouted loudly: "Hit them!" Secret agent thugs ambushing on both sides immediately charged the brigade with carrying poles and wooden sticks, even the wooden frames of nearby air-raid shelters and the iron frames of rickshaws became their weapons. Both ends of Datong Road were guarded by secret agents, and over two hundred students were surrounded and savagely beaten.

    Thirteen students were severely injured on the spot, and more than twenty were slightly injured. Among them, some had their heads smashed open and brains splattered out. A female student named Li Caixiu, only fifteen years old, lost consciousness on the spot after being savagely beaten, and fell unconscious in a pool of blood. The thugs continued to beat her with carrying poles, and she was only saved from a tragic death after being rescued by the surrounding masses. Those most seriously injured and in life-threatening condition included Liu Guangrong (male), whose head was cracked and brain matter protruded; Xu Honggang (male), who had three large lacerations on his head with brain matter protruding; Xie Shigui (female), who was severely injured and mentally deranged; Zhou Jing (male), who suffered severe internal injuries and was covered in blood; and Li Caixiu (female), who suffered severe internal injuries. The masses who witnessed this tragedy were all filled with grief and indignation, and rushed to carry the injured students to the hospital.

    After these two major tragedies occurred, all circles in Chongqing were engulfed in a wave of angry protests. The Anti-American Atrocity Committee, the Democratic National Construction Association, the Constitutional Government Promotion Association, and sixteen other people's organizations issued protest letters and letters of condolence to the students. Every day from dawn to dusk, hundreds of workers, shop assistants, students, teachers, women, and writers continuously went to the hospital to comfort the glorious wounded and launched a fundraising campaign.

    蒋特凶殴抗暴学生
    两大血案详情
    【新华社延安二十六日电】重庆通讯：重庆最近连续发生国民党特务凶殴抗暴学生之大惨案两起，被殴受伤之学生达七十余人，其中重伤者二十人。本月五日，抗议美军暴行联合会宣传队为了深入农村，派出男女学生四十余人渡江至江北进行宣传工作，下午一时在江北公园广场演出街头剧“美军暴行”，群众围观者达六千人。不料突有身穿军服的蒋记特务十余和便服特务暴徒二百余名持砖石棍棒闯入广场，将学生宣传之旗帜、花船、图片完全捣毁，学生与群众起而制止无效，学生们即互相携手，高喊“中国人不打中国人”，迎上前去，毫无人性的特务即趁势乱抓乱打，十个左右一群的包围着一二个学生毒打，场内砖石桌椅棍棒横飞，女学生的毛线衣、蓝布衣服被剥去或撕毁，钢棉大衣被抢去，有两个女生被特务脱去鞋子，百般侮辱。当场被殴重伤者七人，轻伤者二十余人，其中男生王锦波伤势最重，性命垂危；另一学生李熙则被围殴达六次之多，直打到躺在沙滩上动弹不得。许多女学生被老百姓保护到家里去，仍被特务拖出毒打。好些学生在老百姓的护送下，才过了江。
    惨案发生后，震动了渝市的百万市民，一致发出“抗议国民党特务”的怒吼。他们纷纷携带果品赴医院慰问、看护受伤学生，各方慰问的涵电像雪片飞来。七日上午“抗联”百余代表组织请愿队结队游行，向蒋介石重庆行辕及市府进行请愿。这支充满着悲壮和愤怒情绪的队伍沿途高呼：“取消特务组织”、“保障人身自由”、“严惩惨案凶手”等口号，路人都鼓掌同情。
    学生们向蒋介石行辕提出了四项要求：（１）严惩凶手追究责任；（２）赔偿一切损失；（３）保障抗联会之组织及同学之安全；（４）保障此后不发生类似事件。行辕代表口头上接受了学生要求，但市府代表忽而接受忽而推翻，反复达三次之多，终于在群众的义愤和学生的压力下答应了学生的要求。不料，言犹在耳，八号又发生了更大的一件血案。
    八日晨，“抗联”宣传大队二百十二个学生由上清寺出发宣传。行经西路口时，忽有一自称警备部政治部科长者尾随大队，迫令宣传队告以宣传路线后始行离去。宣传行至大同路时，忽有三辆卡车，一辆上载一身穿校官军服军人，从队伍后面横冲直撞，扰乱学生行列。此时，预先站在队伍最前面的身穿军服的军人用口哨示意，高声喊：“打！”两旁埋伏的特务暴徒即用扁担、木棒向大队冲击，连附近防空洞的木架、黄包车上的铁架都成了他们的武器。大同路两端均为特务把守，二百余学生悉被包围。横遭毒打。
    当场学生被殴重伤十三人，轻伤二十余人，其中有被击破头颅、脑浆迸出者，有一个仅十五岁之女生李才秀遭凶殴后当场不省人事，昏倒血泊中，暴徒仍继续以扁担毒打，经四周群众抢救后始免惨死。受伤最重有生命危险者计有刘光荣（男）头部打裂脑浆冒出，许宏刚（男）头上三条大裂口脑浆冒出，谢仕桂（女）其伤甚重精神失常，周竞（男）内部重伤满脸鲜血，李才秀（女）内部重伤。目睹此惨剧发生的群众，莫不悲愤填膺，争先将受伤学生抬送医院。
    这两大惨案发生后，渝市各界都卷入愤激的抗议怒潮中，抗议美军暴行委会、民主建国会、宪政促进会等十六个人民团体发表了抗议书及慰问学生书，每天从清晨到深夜，成百的工人、店员、学生教师、妇女、作家络绎不断的前往医院慰问光荣的负伤者，并发动募捐。（二月十一日）
