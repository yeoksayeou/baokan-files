    【Our Newspaper Taiyue 28th Dispatch】Land reform in the border areas of Zhaocheng, after overcoming ideological obstacles among cadres and with militiamen taking the initiative to attack and protect land distribution, is rapidly unfolding in most areas. Last December, the leadership proposed a "guerrilla warfare and land reform as a unified whole" movement. Some cadres lacked confidence, believing that the border areas were too close to the enemy and that the masses had too many concerns and would not dare to struggle. After January, cadres went to the border villages to publicize the land policy, holding various forms of meetings in each village to explain it. First, in Dong Village, half of the masses participated in the anti-corruption struggle. The masses in Xiaohuma, west of the railway, also rose up to oppose the village head Zhang Liuwa's corruption. By January 18th, when the base points reported, the comrades had a different understanding of the mass movement in the stubborn areas. Everyone believed that "the masses in these places are the most severely oppressed, and they urgently demand to speak out and settle accounts," and "the border areas are densely populated and have little land, and the peasants also urgently demand to be allocated land." On January 29th, at a meeting of group leaders from various base points, a clear arrangement was made to boldly launch a movement integrating land reform and guerrilla warfare. By the end of the month, villages such as Shitun, Mingjiang, Dongcun, Nanfunu, Gengpi, and Chenjia Geta had begun their struggles. When the masses in Chenjia Geta arrested the local tyrant Chen Langyan, a man who had been sick all winter and hadn't left his house asked his mother: "Mom! Is it dawn? They've arrested Chen Langyan, I want to go speak out about my grievances." In this village, only two miles from the railway, only three out of more than one hundred households did not participate in the struggle. An old man said, "The sun has risen from the north, and even the base of the south wall is warm." In terms of struggle methods, most places adopted the method of arresting first and then struggling. The masses in Xiaohuma even brought food and their struggle targets to Nanfunu, east of the railway, to speak out about their grievances and settle accounts. The militiamen's attacks to protect the land distribution took place after the meeting of heroes who killed the enemy in early February. Everyone responded to the call to "hold a gun in one hand and distribute land in the other." The county's militiamen, especially those in the border areas, freely combined into groups of three to five, penetrating near the enemy's strongholds to strike at the enemy's supply lines with sniper fire and explosions. By the end of February, in just twenty days, they had fought twelve battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 41 enemy soldiers (not including sporadic captures), and seizing various weapons such as pistols, grenades, and bullets. Because the militiamen dared to boldly penetrate near enemy strongholds and take the initiative to attack, small groups of enemies did not dare to operate. The militiamen of ×× Village openly came forward to support the masses in their struggle against feudal forces. After the movement began, it caused fear among some middle peasants. Therefore, in conjunction with the movement, land policy propaganda was carried out. Students from the Second Senior Elementary School even formed propaganda teams, going deep into the border villages to explain to the masses in various ways such as plaza dramas, fast-clapper rhymes, and singing, which was extremely welcomed by the local masses.

    民兵三五成组主动打敌人
    赵城边地分田开展迅速
    【本报太岳二十八日电】赵城边沿区土地改革，在干部思想障碍打通、民兵主动出击掩护分田后，运动迅速在大部地区展开。去年腊月，领导上提出开展游击战争土地改革二位一体的运动，有些干部没有信心，认为边缘区离敌人很近，群众顾虑多，不敢斗争。一月份以后，干部到边缘村进行土地政策的宣传，每到一村就召集各种形式的会讲解。首先在东村就有半数群众参加了反贪污斗争。铁路西的小胡麻群众也起来反对村长张六娃的贪污。到一月十八日，各基点汇报时，同志们对接顽区群众运动，有了不同的认识。大家认为：“这些地方群众受压迫最利害，他们迫切要求诉苦清算，”“边缘区人稠地窄，农民也迫切要求分得土地。”一月二十九日在各基点小组长会议上，明确布置了放手发动土地改革游击战争二位一体的运动。到月底已有师屯、明姜、东村、南伏牛、耿辟、陈家圪塔等村开始了斗争。当陈家圪塔的群众把恶霸陈廊延扣起时，一个病了一冬天没有出门的人问他母亲：“妈！天明了吗？人家把陈廊延扣起了，我要诉苦去。”这个离铁路仅二里的村子，一百多户只有三家没参加斗争。一个老汉说：“这是太阳从北出来了，照的南墙根地也热了。”在斗争方法上，大部分采取了先扣后斗。小胡麻的群众还带上给养带上斗争对象到铁路东面的南伏牛来诉苦算账。民兵的出击掩护分田，是在二月上旬开了杀敌英雄会议之后，大家响应一手拿枪一手分田的号召，全县民兵特别是边缘区的民兵都自由结合，三五成组，深入到敌人的据点附近，以冷枪爆炸打击敌人的补给线，到二月底仅二十天就打了十二次仗，毙伤俘敌四十一人（零星俘获的不在内），缴获手枪、手榴弹、子弹等武器多样。由于民兵敢于大胆深入敌据点附近主动出击，小股敌人便不敢活动。××村民兵公开出头，支持群众和封建势力斗争。运动开始后，有些地方引起了中农的恐惧，因此便结合运动，进行土地政策宣传。第二高小学生，更组成宣传队，深入边缘村，以广场剧、快板、唱歌等多样方式，给群众解释，极为当地群众欢迎。
