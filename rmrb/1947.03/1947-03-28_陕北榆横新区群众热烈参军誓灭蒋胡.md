Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th—The Chiang Kai-shek army's invasion of the border region has sparked a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army among the masses in the Yu(lin)heng(shan) New District in northern Shaanxi. By the beginning of March, Zhenchuan County alone had seen 800 young people join the main forces. Wang Anfu of Wang Xingzhuang recovered eight hectares of land that had been seized by landlords more than ninety years ago during the land reform. At the same time, the rent was reduced for the more than ten hectares of land he leased. To defend the land, he and his two brothers competed to join the army. Wang Anfu secretly signed up that night. His wife encouraged her husband to fight bravely in the army, while she would work hard at home spinning and weaving. Liu Lianyuan of Hebao Third Township's grandfather was forced to flee by the Chiang Kai-shek government in the past, and his father was forced to commit suicide because he could not pay the military grain. This time, he resolutely demanded to join the Eighth Route Army to avenge this irreconcilable hatred. Thousands of new soldiers, sent off by their parents, siblings, and relatives, all vowed not to return home until Chiang and Hu's armies were wiped out.

    陕北榆横新区群众热烈参军誓灭蒋胡
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】蒋军侵犯边区，已在榆（林）横（山）新区群众中激起参军热潮。至三月初，仅镇川一县即有八百名青年投入主力。王兴庄的王安富在土地改革中收回了九十多年前被地主强占去的八垧地，同时租种的十多垧地也减了租，他和两个兄弟为保卫土地都争相参军，王安富当晚悄悄的去报了名，他妻子鼓励丈夫在部队里要奋勇杀敌，她在家努力纺线织布。河堡三乡刘涟元祖父过去被蒋政府逼迫逃亡，父亲因为无力缴军粮被逼自杀，这次他坚决要求参加八路军，报此不共戴天之仇。千万名新战士在父母兄妹欢送中，均誓言不灭蒋胡军决不回家。
