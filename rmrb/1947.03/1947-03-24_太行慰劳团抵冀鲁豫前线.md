From now on, we must intensify production and practice thrift to support the complete victory of the patriotic self-defense war. Comrades! Please rest assured that your families are being taken care of by the five million people of the Taihang region, and are the joint responsibility of cadres at all levels of the Party, government, and military. At present, we are extensively carrying out the movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. We hope that you will continue to achieve great victories. We extend our special and cordial greetings to wounded and sick comrade Zhou Zhi and wish him a speedy recovery." Soldier Meng Wangxi received a letter from his wife stating: "Today our family was allocated two mu of good land, ten rooms, eight dou of grain, and a fat sheep. The cadres are taking good care of us. There are no difficulties at home at all. A few days ago, I heard in the winter school that the bandit Chiang is coming to attack us again. Please wipe him out completely and come back to live a good life." On the 27th, the comrades of the慰问 group went to various teams of the unit to express their regards and introduce the construction of the Taihang region and the liberation of the peasants. The soldiers were in extremely high spirits and said, "We will fight more beautiful battles to respond to the greetings of the people of Taihang."
