"China's Destiny" and Its Fate in America

According to New York airmail news, Chiang Kai-shek's book "China's Destiny" has had two translated versions published in the United States. One version is annotated by Mr. Jaffe, an expert on Far Eastern issues and editor of the "Amerasia" magazine. Two Chinese professors translated it based on the original book published in Chongqing in March 1943 and is distributed by Roy Publishers in New York. The other translation is by Wang Chonghui and published by Macmillan. Wang’s translation, in order to please his current masters, the American imperialists, has added flattering words to the United States that were not in the original book. At the same time, it deletes "Western imperialists" and replaces them with "Japanese imperialists," with whom he used to collude, and removes several passages unfavorable to the United States and Britain. The original translation distributed by Roy Publishers includes comments from Theodore White, Annalee Jacoby, and Roy Publishers, all of whom believe that "China's Destiny" is China's "Mein Kampf," and said: "From this book, we can see Chiang Kai-shek's absolute belief in the 'leader,' that is, Hitler and dictators, his plan to maintain the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship at the cost of civil war, and his views on China's future foreign relations." Konrad, the book review editor of the Republican New York Herald Tribune, wrote a review on January 28, also believing that it is correct to call the book "China's Mein Kampf." Pralcod, the book review editor of the New York Times, commented in the newspaper on January 28: "Chiang Kai-shek's 'China's Destiny' will make China conform to the ancient Chinese tradition of centralized feudal autocracy, or even more to modern totalitarianism; in any case, it will not be democratic." Yue Fei, the foreign news editor of the Afternoon Post, commented on January 23: "From all aspects, it proves what has long been known, that the feudal-minded 'China's Destiny' is in Chiang's mind nothing more than feudal fascism and the perpetuation of Chiang himself and the Kuomintang's power." The Chicago Sun published an article by a certain writer on February 1, who expressed deep disgust with the book, asking: "Can the Kuomintang represent the wishes of the Chinese people? Is Chiang qualified to explain China's destiny?" Dr. John King Fairbank, former director of the United States Information Service, wrote in the New York Times: "China's industrialization may be used mainly to strengthen the power of the state and its rulers, as in the past in Japan, and it may also be used to improve the lives of the majority of Chinese peasants. Chiang's view of 'China's Destiny' belongs to the former and definitely not the latter. If we support it, we will fall into a state of eternal doom."

    《中国之命运》在美国之命运
    据纽约航讯，蒋介石所著的《中国之命运》一书已有两种译本先后在美出版，一种译本系由美国远东问题专家美亚杂志编辑贾非注释，中国两个教授根据一九四三年三月在渝出版之该书原本译出，而由纽约洛伊公司发行；另一译本则系王宠惠所译，麦克米伦公司出版。王译本为讨好其现在主子美帝国主义者已增添了原书中所无的讨好美国的文字，同时并将“西方帝国主义者”删去，代以其过去与之勾搭的“日本帝国主义”，并将若干对美英不利之处删去。洛伊公司发行之原本译本中有白修德及贾安娜与洛伊公司之评语，俱认为《中国之命运》一书乃中国的《我的奋斗》，并谓：“我们可由此书看见蒋介石对于‘元首’即希特勒与独裁者的绝对信仰，他不惜以内战维持国民党一党独裁的计划，以及他对中国未来对外关系的见解”。共和党的纽约先驱论坛报书评编辑康奈德于一月二十八日撰文评论，亦认为称该书为“中国的《我的奋斗》”是正确的。纽约时报书评编辑泼赖科德一月二十八日在该报评称：“蒋介石所著的《中国之命运》将使中国与中国古代之中央封建集权传统相称，或更与现在之极权主义相合，无论如何都不会是民主的。”下午报国外新闻编辑岳非一月二十三日评称：“从各方面看来，证明了早已周知的事，即具有封建思想的《中国之命运》在蒋心目中不过是封建的法西斯主义以及蒋本人与国民党权力的承存而已。”芝加哥太阳报在二月一日登载某名作家一文，他对该书表示深恶痛绝，他问：“国民党能代表中国人民的愿望吗？蒋有资格说明中国之命运吗？”前美国新闻处长费正清博士于纽约时报上写道：“中国工业化可能利用为主要在加强国家及其统治者的力量，一如过去之日本，同时也可能利用来改良大多数中国农民的生活，蒋的《中国之命运》的见解是属于前者而绝非后者，如果我们予以支持，将使我们陷于万劫不复之境。”
