　　*Liberation Daily* Editorial Warns UNRRA
　　Do Not Be a Tool for American Aggression Against China
　　Should Immediately Stop Chiang Kai-shek's Murderous Trade
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] *Liberation Daily* published an editorial entitled "Oppose New Blood Debts," stating: Chiang Kai-shek's "emergency measures" to "resolve" the recent financial crisis are firstly, implementing "national" (i.e., the Four Big Families') wartime comprehensive control, and secondly, seeking further assistance from the United States, requesting UNRRA to exchange $200 million worth of industrial machinery and other relief supplies for cotton and wheat in order to sell them on the black market and use the proceeds for civil war expenses. UNRRA believes that as long as the Chiang government can "guarantee that the cotton it obtains is used for farmers in need and does not flow into the black market," it can "approve this plan." The editorial pointed out that UNRRA's declared purpose is to provide relief to disaster-stricken people in various countries without discrimination based on race or political belief. The people in China's liberated areas who have suffered from war account for more than half of the country's total, but the relief supplies they receive account for only 2% of the total UNRRA shipments to China, while the vast majority of supplies sent to the Kuomintang areas fall into the hands of the Four Big Families and are used for civil war. If UNRRA truly approves Chiang Kai-shek's so-called cotton and wheat purchase plan, this batch of cotton and wheat will inevitably flow into the black market to fill the bottomless pit of civil war financing. The editorial recalled events from fourteen or fifteen years ago, stating that when the Japanese invaders had already established the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932, and the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army was in dire straits in Heilongjiang, Chiang Kai-shek used all his strength to conduct civil war. On November 30th of that year, American imperialism gave him a so-called "cotton and wheat loan" of $13 million. In 1933, Japan captured Shanhaiguan and invaded Rehe. At that time, the Chinese Soviet Government issued a declaration calling for joint resistance against Japan with all the country's armies under three conditions. However, Chiang Kai-shek still recklessly "suppressed the Communists," and American imperialism again gave Chiang Kai-shek a "cotton and wheat loan" of $50 million on June 4th. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek also said that this sum would definitely be used for production. However, according to the testimony of Senator Reed, Chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Investigating Committee, the entire sum was used to purchase arms and aircraft. The editorial strongly stated: Chiang Kai-shek is now launching a new $200 million "cotton and wheat purchase plan" to "stabilize the economy." The Chinese people have certainly not forgotten the painful lessons of history and will surely rise up to resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's new murderous trade. At the same time, it warns the American authorities that $200 million in assistance can only be squandered by the Chiang Kai-shek government for a maximum of 24 days and will not help at all. However, for the entire Chinese people, it will add new hatred on top of old grievances, and this will be a new blood debt. The people of the liberated areas of China have every reason and right to demand that UNRRA reject Chiang Kai-shek's absurd request and approve the plan proposed by the China Liberated Areas Relief Association to allocate all $200 million worth of relief supplies to the disaster-stricken people in the liberated areas. Otherwise, the Chinese people will forever recognize that UNRRA is merely a tool of American imperialism to interfere in China's internal affairs, massacre the Chinese people, especially the disaster-stricken people of China.

　　解放日报著论警告联总
    不要做美国侵华工具
    应即制止蒋介石的杀人买卖
    【新华社延安二十七日电】解放日报以《反对新血账》为题发表社论称：蒋介石为了“解救”最近的财政金融恐慌采取的“紧急措施”，一是实行“国家”（即四大家族）战时全面管制，二是求美国进一步的帮助，要求联总将两亿美元的工业机械等救济物资换为棉花、小麦，以便销行黑市，充做内战战费，联总认为：只要蒋政府能“保证其所得之棉花用于有几顷需要之农民，而不任其流入黑市”，就可以“批准此项计划”。社论指出：联总宣布的宗旨是不问种族、政治信仰的差异，不加歧视地救济各国的灾难民。中国解放区因战争而受灾难的人民占全国半数以上，但所得救济物资只占联总运华物资的百分之二，而送给国民党地区的则绝大部分落入四大家族之手，作内战之用。蒋介石此次所谓购买棉麦计划，如果联总真个批准，这批棉麦势必流入黑市，填塞内战财政的无底洞。社论于此回忆十四五年前的往事称：当一九三二年日本侵略者已建制了伪满，东北义勇军在黑龙江陷入绝境的时候，蒋介石却用全力进行内战，美帝国主义便于当年十一月三十日给他以一千三百万美元的所谓“棉麦借款”。一九三三年日本攻陷了山海关，打进了热河，当时中华苏维埃政府发表宣言，号召愿在三条件下与全国各军队共同抗日。但是，蒋介石仍是放肆“剿共”，美帝国主义又在六月四日给蒋介石一笔五千万美元的“棉麦借款”，当时蒋介石也说这笔款项一定用于生产事业。但据美参院军需调查委员会主席雷氏证明，这款项全部用作购买军火和飞机。社论力称：蒋介石今天又要来一个二万万“棉麦购买计划”来“稳定经济”了，中国人民决然没有忘掉历史的惨痛教训，必然要起来坚决反对蒋介石这一新的杀人买卖。同时，警告美国当局，二万万美元的帮助，对于蒋介石政府最多只能挥霍二十四天，丝毫不顶事。但对于全中国人民，却又将在旧冤之上添上新仇，这将是一笔新的血账。中国解放区人民有充分的理由和权利要求联总拒绝蒋介石这一荒谬要求，并批准中国解放区救济总会提出的计划，将二万万美元的救济物资全部拨归解放区灾难民应用。否则，中国人民将永远认定，联总只是美帝国主义干涉中国内政、残杀中国人民、特别是中国灾难民的工具。
