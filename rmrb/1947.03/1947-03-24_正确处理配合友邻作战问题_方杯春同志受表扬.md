    Correctly Handling Cooperation with Neighboring Units
    Comrade Fang Beichun Commended
    [Report from the JiluYu Front, this newspaper, 22nd] The Political Department of the JinjiLuYu Military Region Field Army recently issued a circular commending Comrade Fang Beichun, a model instructor of a certain unit in the Battle of Juye (now promoted to director of the political department of the regiment), for being able to consider the overall situation on the battlefield, not compete for merit, correctly handle internal disputes, and strengthen unity. The commendation is as follows: "Order No. 1 of the Political Department of the JinjiLuYu Military Region Field Headquarters for Commendation and Reward, March 19th. – Commendation of Model Instructor Comrade Fang Beichun. During the Juye operation, after the first detachment of the ××× unit broke into the South Gate, Instructor Fang Beichun led his unit to develop towards East Street from the designated area. Soldier Li Honglian reported: "I just captured a prisoner. He said there are more than a hundred enemies and an officer in the southeast corner of the field. Please order us to quickly seize their weapons." At that time, Instructor Fang considered that the field was not the unit's operational area, so he reported the situation to the regimental commander. The regimental commander immediately said: "Since the neighboring unit has not arrived, you should go." Instructor Fang then led his troops to charge into the tower, forcing the enemy to surrender. At this time, a certain unit responsible for the operation in that area arrived at the foot of the tower and, seeing that the enemy had been eliminated by Instructor Fang and his troops, began to argue. Instructor Fang immediately shouted from the tower: "There is nothing to argue about before the enemy is completely eliminated. This matter is easy to solve." He then handed over all the captured personnel and weapons to that unit. He immediately led his troops away from the disputed area and continued to annihilate the enemy. Comrade Fang Beichun's exemplary behavior of obeying orders, cooperating with neighboring units, and correctly handling internal disputes on the battlefield, ensuring internal unity, demonstrates the high political principles of the People's Liberation Army cadres and the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. In addition to ordering the column to assess his merits and award him a commendation, a special circular is issued for commendation, and the entire army is called upon to learn from him."

    正确处理配合友邻作战问题
    方杯春同志受表扬
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十二日电】晋冀鲁豫军区野战政治部顷以巨野之战某部模范教导员方杯春同志，（现已升任团政治处主任）在战场上能顾全大局，不争功，正确处理内部争执问题，加强了团结，特通令表扬如下：“晋冀鲁豫军区野战司令部政治部通令奖励一号，三月十九日。——表扬模范教导员方杯春同志。巨野作战时，×××部队第一分队突进南门后，教导员方杯春带领所部由指定地区向东大街发展，战士李洪连报告：“刚才捉着一个俘虏，他说东南角场上有一百多个敌人，还有一个官长。请首长下命令，叫咱们赶快去缴枪。”当时方教导员考虑到场上非本单位作战地区，即将情形报告团长。团长当即说：“既然友邻部队没有到，你们就去吧。”方教导员即率部前往冲进塔上，迫使敌人投降。这时担任该地区作战的某部才到达塔下，见敌人已为方教导员率部解决，便争执起来。方教导员即在塔上高呼：“敌人还没消灭前没有什么可争的，这事情好解决。”随即将所俘人枪移交某部。马上率部离开争执地点，继续歼灭敌人。方杯春同志这种在战场上遵守命令，协同友邻，并正确处理内部争执，保证内部团结的模范行为，表现了人民解放军干部的高度政治原则性，和共产党员的崇高品质。除令该纵队评定其功绩予以记功外，特通令表扬，并号召全军向他学习。”
