　　The Self-Defense Fortress on the Tongpu Railway Line
    The Yin Di Joint Defense Area

　　Yin'de Village in Huo County is located on the railway line south of the city, surrounded by strongholds of the Chiang, Yan, and puppet (Japanese collaborationist) forces. It has used ingenious mine warfare combined with sniping to repel countless attacks by the Chiang, Yan, and puppet troops. It is hailed as the Du Ba Lian (referring to a particularly heroic village) on the Tongpu Railway Line.

　　Last October, when Chiang's army invaded northward, the villagers were momentarily panicked. Some hid their sickles, some buried their weapons, and a few even fled to other villages. However, Zhu Shuanxi and Zhang Yinba, heroes in killing the enemy, remained exceptionally calm and brave, going to the railway to plant stone mines to stop Chiang's army from advancing. People in the village asked in disbelief, "You dare to plant mines?" "The central army's rocket launchers are much more powerful!" They ignored the questions and not only planted mines but also sneaked into Xin Zhi Station to ambush the enemy, killing one, capturing one alive, and seizing two rifles. This reassured everyone, and they began to say with confidence, "Chiang Kai-shek's army is also just bluffing." Zhang Qingren said to them enthusiastically, "Call me next time, I'll go too." From then on, more and more farmers participated in protecting their homes and fields, and the elusive mine warfare repeatedly thwarted Chiang's army's offensives. Last December, Chiang's 90th Division twice gathered more than a thousand troops to attack the village, but both times they were kicked out. On December 6th, the enemy attacked in three routes. As soon as they entered the minefield, they stepped on one, killing one soldier. The ambushing militiamen fired cold shots simultaneously, making it impossible for the enemy to advance or retreat. They were surrounded for a whole day, and one enemy soldier was killed and six were wounded, forcing them to retreat in defeat. That night, the militiamen estimated that the enemy would retaliate and moved the masses overnight. The next day, before dawn, the enemy did attack the village again, but upon entering the village, they couldn't even find a chicken. Just as they were hesitating, mines and cold shots rang out all around, instantly killing three people and wounding three, forcing them to retreat in disarray once more.

　　The Yin'de Joint Defense Zone is not only capable of defense but also capable of offense. On December 10th last year, the Yin'de militiamen planted mines near Bali Zhaifang. Because the weather was too cold, the mines they planted could not be disguised. They came up with an idea and created the "Mud God Scolding Formation," carrying out the mud god from the temple and placing it on the mine, and writing on the mud god: "Yan Xishan, Chiang Kai-shek! How's your civil war going? I see it's not working out well, you're just losing hundreds of thousands of men; desert and go home!" The third day, when the enemy passed by there, they saw this "Mud God" and were both angry and annoyed. They kicked it, and with a loud bang, one enemy soldier was killed and four were wounded.

　　Although the Yin'de Village militia has won constant victories, they are never arrogant or complacent. They say, "Only the united strength of the masses can defeat the enemy!" When Cao Village carried out land reform, they asked Yin'de to provide protection. The Yin'de militiamen did not hesitate and provided protection for more than ten days. After Cao Village completed its land reform, it expanded its armed forces and joined Yin'de's joint defense. They frequently conduct self-criticism to strengthen their ties with the masses and improve their tactics. Therefore, the Yin'de Joint Defense Zone can stand firm on the Tongpu Railway Line and become a strong self-defense fortress. (Tai Yue Di News)

　　同蒲线上的自卫堡垒
    阴底联防区
    霍县阴的村在城南铁路线上，四周是蒋阎伪的据点，它用神奇雷阵，结合冷枪击退过蒋阎伪无数次进攻，被誉为同蒲线上的杜八联。
    去年十月蒋军北犯，使该村老百姓一时惊惶失措，有的藏镰刀，有的埋武器，更有少数逃往别村。可是，杀敌英雄朱拴喜、张银把却异常镇静勇敢，到铁路上去埋石雷，阻止蒋军前进。村里人惊疑地问：“你们敢去埋雷？”“中央军的火箭炮厉害的多哩！”他俩没有理会，不仅埋了雷，还跑到辛治车站偷袭敌人，打死了一个，活捉了一个，缴了两支步枪。这一下大家才沉住了气，开始有信心地说：“蒋介石军也扯蛋。”张青人对他俩热心地说：“下次叫上我吧，我也去。”从此参加保乡保田的农民愈来愈多，和邻村组织联防，神出鬼没的地雷战一次次阻击了蒋军的进犯。去年十二月。蒋军第九十师曾两次集结兵力千余进攻该村，都被踢了出去。十二月六日，敌人分三路进攻，刚走入地雷网，就踏响一颗，炸死一人。埋伏的民兵冷枪齐发，敌进退不得，整整被围困了一天，被打死一名打伤六名，只得废然撤退。当晚，民兵们估计敌人会报复，连夜叫群众转移。第二天天色未明，敌人果然又进攻该村了，可是进村后连鸡也找不到一只。正在迟疑，四周又响起了地雷和冷枪，一下炸死三个人，伤了三个人，又只得狼狈退出。
    阴的联防战区不仅能守，而且能攻。去年十二月十日，阴的民兵到八里寨房埋雷，因天气太冷，埋下的雷不能伪装。他们急中生智，创造了“泥神骂阵”，把庙里泥神抬出来，放在雷上，又在泥神上写了：“阎锡山、蒋介石！你们内战打的怎么样？我看打的不上算，净光舍了几十万；开小差回家吧！”第三天敌人经过那儿，见到这“泥神”，又气又恼，一脚踢去，轰隆一声，敌人被炸死一个，炸伤四个。
    阴的村的民兵虽然不断胜利，但从不骄傲自满。他们说：“只有群众团结一致的力量才能打胜敌人！”曹村进行土地改革，请阴的去掩护。阴的民兵毫不犹豫，直掩护了十多天。曹村土地改革完成后，扩大了武装，加入了阴的的联防。他们经常进行检讨，以加强与群众联系和提高战术。因此，阴的联防区能屹然立于同蒲线上，成为坚强的自卫堡垒。（太岳迪讯）
