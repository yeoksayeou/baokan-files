The "Peasant University" in Nanjingse, is an ingenious creation of peasants for their own systematic emancipation education during the in-depth land reform movement.

I. Introduction

The story of Nanjingse Village running a "Peasant University" has a background.

Nanjingse is a "first-class village" in Hengshui District, Lin County. The work foundation of this village is indeed relatively good. After the liberation of the Shui (Hengshui) Lin (County) highway in 1944, Nanjingse was the first to engage in struggle; before this in-depth land reform movement, Nanjingse also engaged in the most struggles—a total of more than 110 struggles in five natural villages. Especially during the struggle last spring, most of the land was changed, and more than 30 special agents were "clarified"; when it comes to handing over public grain, participating in the war, and joining the army, which one was not completed 100%? The work of the "Passing Army Reception Station" was also praised! Therefore, cadres and activists were very complacent, and the district also felt that the movement in this village was "almost" done.

At the beginning of January this year, cadres from the 7th and 8th districts held a joint meeting in Nanjingse to discuss the issue of deepening the movement. At that time, everyone focused on the backward villages, and the villages that were "almost" done (this type of village accounted for a large proportion in Hengshui District) seemed to only need to shift to production movement. However, Comrade Yu Guang of the County Party Committee, who was responsible for leading the work in the 7th and 8th districts at the time, proved from his actual investigation that this was not the case. There were still many problems in the so-called "almost" done villages. He personally checked the work in Nanjingse, and specifically talked to poor peasants, hired peasants, and family members of revolutionary soldiers, and found that the village cadres did not publicize the land reform of "filling in the gaps and making up for deficiencies" to the masses after the meeting. Only a few cadres were leading the "anti-" special agents. The masses reflected that "anti-special agents are not as good as 'clarifying' old rich men." Political Director Qin Wu Cheng said: "Humph! You have no vision. People are shooting black guns, but you can't see them?" Although other cadres did not completely follow Qin Wu Cheng, they felt that "there is not much oil and water left in the old rich men. If we continue to fight, we will be fighting the middle peasants!" "We don't want to fill in the gaps and make up for deficiencies either. Let those who haven't turned over do it!" They also said: "You are the pioneers, and we will back you up!" Adopting a passive wait-and-see attitude. When county and district cadres visited door-to-door, the family member of a revolutionary soldier, Wu Cheng's sister-in-law, began to complain. She said, "I raised my opinion three or four times in the past, but the cadres always rejected it, saying it was a small opinion. Should I say it or not!" An honest peasant said, "The year the Eighth Route Army came, the rich peasants Chang Jianwen and Qin Jianping led the 'Hu Lu team' to rob his house. He secretly reported to the Eighth Route Army in the west. Qin Jianping led the bandits of the 'Hu Lu team' from Xiliang Village and killed three members of his family!" He said, "I didn't dare to mention it in the past because I was afraid that people wouldn't believe me! This time, I'm not afraid of 'the sky changing.' I'm just afraid that if I raise it, it won't be resolved for me!" A total of 15 poor peasant households were investigated, as well as eight households that had returned from fleeing the famine, lacking houses and land. Based on these facts, a meeting of cadres and old activists was convened to ask everyone to recall: How did we rise up in struggle? In the beginning, the cadres all showed off their merits, and were not convinced, saying: "Back then, we activists carried guns day and night to fight the 'Hu Lu team.' Later, we led the struggle against the landlords and rich peasants. Isn't that what we did? Now he's forgotten everything! He's raising opinions now!" The leadership first affirmed and praised everyone's merits, and then led everyone to discuss: Have we completely turned over? Who hasn't turned over yet? At this time, new and old activists were gathered together to hold a meeting. Everyone unanimously believed that they must unite and make a general reckoning with the landlords and rich peasants in order to completely turn over. The organized inspection team went to each street and household to inspect and complain at the same time. In an instant, more than 40 households who had not turned over gathered around, collecting more than 400 opinions. Even the middle peasants raised opinions. When the old activists saw that the new activists were doing well, their enthusiasm was also boosted. They swore to the masses on the spot: "Don't be afraid, everyone, struggle! I will take the lead and resolutely do it!" The great movement began.

II. Establishment of the "Emancipation Corps"

When the great movement began, someone proposed to organize an emancipation work team. The masses said: "Humph! We won't call it a work team. There is a 'Return Home Corps' in the east. Let's establish an 'Emancipation Corps'!" "Right!" "Right!" For a time, the merit book, the complaint department, and the speech place were all established, regardless of whether it was day or night! They hung up lanterns and started working. Everyone said: Let's do it openly. Anyway, the land is ours and should be returned. Let us be the masters.

The fifty or so cadres of the "Emancipation Corps" elected by the masses and those who signed up voluntarily led more than 300 activists to go deep into each street and household to publicize: "Now our policies and decrees have changed. You can say what you didn't say enough in the past, and you can get what you didn't get! This is the last struggle, don't miss the good opportunity!" Someone asked: "Can small opinions be raised?" Poor peasant activists said: "Humph, small opinions are real big pains! In the past, the landlords and rich peasants beat my man to death and deducted two acres of good land from me, and only gave me five dou of rice for the deal! Don't be afraid, raise your opinions!"

"I only got a rent reduction for two years. Can I raise this?"

"Yes!"

"I have no opinions on the five big households. Can I raise opinions on the middle peasants?"

"Yes!"

"Can I raise opinions on the village cadres and district cadres?"

"Yes!"

"I was still young when my father died, but I vaguely remember something. Can I raise it?"

"Yes!"

"The rent reduction for the landlord in the neighboring village was not settled. Now he is still secretly asking me for interest! Can I recalculate?"

"Yes!"

When the preparations began, there were still a very few "backward" peasants who did not speak. The newly rising poor peasant activists then advised him: "Don't drink cold water like a hanging ghost, or shit dry bamboo like eating chaff!" "What are you afraid of? If you want to do it, don't calculate. Don't be afraid of breaking your head with a fan!" The masses clamored: "To hell with being polite and considerate!" "The landlords eat so much that they're almost falling over with fat, and we're so thin that we're almost dying!" "The wealth and status of the landlords are the result of our suffering! Every piece of land and every ticket is made of our blood and sweat! If we don't dare to take it back, what conditions are we talking about? Our poverty and their wealth is the most reasonable condition! If you have any opinions, please speak up!" Forming a mass movement to mobilize the backward.

Before the general assembly for complaining, the "Emancipation Corps" reviewed the past failures (shortcomings): Find the target first and then struggle, the masses' anger is not fully vented, and they are not happy. This time, it was decided to boldly let the masses complain and raise opinions, and distinguish the targets in the struggle. The slogan "You can complain about anything, and you can raise opinions on anyone" was put forward. Upon hearing this, those who were working as hired laborers in other villages also returned, those who had fled the famine also returned, and the sick also rode donkeys to rush over. Misery led to misery, opinion led to opinion. While complaining, they analyzed, struggled, and calculated accounts and clarified property, for a full five days. A total of more than 1,000 issues were raised, and 21 households were "clarified" (ten of which were middle peasants). The cadres and activists of the "Emancipation Corps" then held a meeting for them, saying: "Raising opinions is to wash your face and wipe away the dirt, for the better. Don't be afraid, isn't it the same to raise opinions for the cadres?" Especially seeing that they were not among the first or second-class targets (the first and second-class targets were all feudal lords, rich peasants, and special agents), and they were not beaten or forced to wear tall hats to beg for assurances, these ten or so middle peasants were relieved. They said: "In the past, it was said that poor and middle peasants were one family, but there was always something unnatural in my heart. This time, everything has been 'clarified', and there is nothing more enjoyable than this!" Many middle peasants voluntarily took out the things they had hidden for the landlords, feudal lords, and rich peasants and handed them over to the "Emancipation Corps." Twenty or so middle peasants joined the peasant association. During the complaining process, a separate meeting of poor peasant women activists was also held, and it was proposed that "If women don't speak up, the landlords won't be 'clarified'! If women don't turn over, men's emancipation is only half!" So that men actively supported women, and the most backward stratum was also mobilized. A total of 167 poor peasant men and women emerged, and more than 40 new activists emerged.

III. The Masses Voluntarily Demand "Brainwashing"

The complaining struggle improved the masses, and also trained cadres and educated Party members. The Party branch began to discuss: Since our Communist Party serves the masses and seeks benefits for the masses, is it better to be big or small? It was said that it was better to be big. They also discussed why our village branch had not developed. Was it because there were no suitable candidates? It was said no. In terms of composition, there were hired peasants who were better than us; in terms of struggle, they dared to fight even more than us; in terms of unity, they had even more mass support than us. But why didn't we develop them? Some said it was because they raised opinions against them; others said they were afraid that they were "loose-lipped" and unreliable, exposing themselves. Therefore, they didn't even dare to talk about the Communist Party to the masses who wanted to know about it. After reviewing, it was decided to openly discuss the Party in the peasant association and among the masses. Everyone spoke up: "In the old society, there was no way out for us poor people. We had all kinds of ideas. Some beggars walked to the gate of the landlord's house and thought: 'They can't finish eating it and feed it to the pigs. If only I could eat this meal one day!' Some thought: 'If I ever become emperor, I will shoot the old rich men with a gun!' 'If I ever become an official, I will seek benefits for everyone!' Seeing the landlords riding tall mules and horses, I thought: 'I don't need livestock. I just want to suffer less!' 'I don't matter. I just want to be able to support my mother!' Even thinking: 'If I stumble and pick up a silver ingot!'... Although there were all kinds of ideas, no one had a way. The old society forced you to become a thief or a bandit! To hang yourself or starve to death! Today, with the Communist Party leading everyone, there is a clear path to struggle. Look, isn't today 'one day'?!"

People continued to say: "After getting something, we are afraid that Chiang Kai-shek will come and rob it. We think about how to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. It just so happens that the Communist Party is leading everyone to fight Chiang Kai-shek and defend the good times. Don't you feel great?! Don't you feel happy?!" Then they discussed who the Communist Party was. Some said it was the Eighth Route Army, some said it was the cadres, and some said it was the peasant association. Another person retorted that it was not right. If it was the peasant association, wouldn't we all be communists? Another person stood up to prove that it was not right. He had personally seen the Communist Party in Taiyuan in the 24th year of the Republic of China. They were wearing locomotive caps... Everyone discussed a lot. In short, they felt that the Communist Party was good and that the Communist Party was doing things that were on their minds. They wanted to be in the Party, but they didn't know where to find it. The County Party Committee explained to everyone: Every village has the Communist Party. The old root of communism is the masses. Whoever can serve the masses well can be in the Communist Party. Everyone suddenly understood. ×× new activist Party members even more actively asked to know: "How can we serve the masses? How can we truly become the servants of the masses? New peasant association members and new women's federation members all actively asked to know what was going on inside the peasant association and the women's federation, and where they would be working in the future? Especially at this time, an incident occurred. The county, district, and village cadres all advocated distributing the fruits of struggle according to need, but the masses insisted on drawing lots, saying: You all talk about democracy and the mass line. Why don't you let us be the masters? The cadres said: Whatever you say, that's what we'll do. On the morning of the 22nd day of the twelfth lunar month, on a large area of eleven mu on the edge of Nanjingse Village, the fruits of struggle were displayed in a colorful array. The masses were all happily going to the "Fruits of Struggle Fair." As a result, a middle peasant wanted a floral cloth to make clothes, but drew a jar of stir-fried noodles. A poor peasant wanted some scraps of cloth and cotton batting to make a quilt, but drew a pair of planks. No one was satisfied, but they couldn't complain about the cadres. Everyone said: "This won't work. We need to be trained and brainwashed!"

IV. The "Peasant University" Opens

"To brainwash, let's go to the county for training. It's too far! Let's start our own school for two days. Whoever wants to brainwash can come in." Three hundred people came at once, bringing their own dry food and supplies, and eating "emancipation meals" together. Everyone said: "In the past, the landlords and rich peasants ran a normal school in Longmen Temple. This time, we're running a peasant university." Someone advocated calling it a self-training class, but everyone said, "Let's still run a 'Peasant University.' Landlords and rich peasants can't even get into our university. They don't understand our principles."

The "Peasant University" opened like this, without teachers, and they taught themselves. The village chief served as the principal, the political director served as the political instructor, and the cadres were also assigned work. In the process, members who were enlightened earlier and those who were enlightened later turned around and became teachers for the cadres. At the same time, new and old members and new and old Party members learned from each other and taught each other. The university was divided into four classes: peasant association, women, militia, and Party members. Class leaders and group leaders were democratically elected. Then there was a collective discussion of the curriculum. "Let's talk about the peasant association class first! In the old society, could we rise up in struggle? Why were some people active in the struggle and some not? This is the first lesson, let everyone talk about it." Everyone spoke up: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no us! In the past, we were all craftsmen, and we couldn't live in the tall buildings and mansions we built. Now they all belong to us, look how much we got!" "In the past, we didn't know that we had such great power. We can't turn over without struggle!"... The first lesson for the militia was to discuss: "Why do we ordinary people still need to take up guns when we have the Eighth Route Army? Who are we fighting for? And who are we fighting with?" They clarified that they were fighting for everyone, for their wives and children, and fighting with the landlord Chiang Kai-shek, and reviewed the special thought of being "one level higher than the ordinary people." The Party members mainly talked about why each person wanted to be in the Party? What did they plan to do in the Party? How to love the masses, love the militia, and serve the masses? The topic of the women's class was: Who caused our women to suffer in the past? Why do our men scold their wives and beat their children? Many women who had been living in "secret" and "inauspicious" circumstances said: "Hey! We were poor in the past, and we were useless here! Damn it, damn it! I'm not here anymore! I want my descendants to always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" Several female family members of revolutionary soldiers said: "This time, I am completely willing. In the past, I always felt a little unhappy when my men and children joined the army. Not this time!" Wu Cheng's sister-in-law even wanted to send her second child to join the army. During the learning process, when a family member of a revolutionary soldier got married, the women also voluntarily carried the sedan chair, established household chores for the family members of the revolutionary soldiers, and trekked through the snow to send firewood to the army thirty or forty miles away. They tidied up the passing army reception station.

Following closely was a large class with all four classes together, talking to each other, and praising the thirty or forty activists in the peasant association. When it came to political director Qin Wu Cheng, everyone said: "Although Wu Cheng has shortcomings and his attitude is not good, he is resolute, sharp-eyed, and quick-handed." The armed forces and various systems solicited opinions, and solved the "knots." Everyone's conclusion was: Without the Communist Party, we would never be able to turn over. Only by rising up ourselves and struggling resolutely can we get the large, good land with landlords' silver ingots. To defend the fruits of struggle, we can only do it ourselves. If we do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, and promoting participation in the army and the war, the whole village must be united into one machine, just like fighting a war, with infantry, artillery, and machine guns, and there must be leadership. Even the location of the village command was discussed.

The last lesson was a collective discussion on the distribution of the fruits of struggle. The topic was called "Whose fault is it?" Everyone said: The cadres were right after all, to distribute according to need. We couldn't think straight for a while, and thought that everyone wanted the good stuff, and who would want the bad stuff? As a result, only one militiaman got a floral quilt, his wife got a good mattress, and the two of them were just right. The rest were not suitable for anyone. To use an analogy, if we distribute according to need, it would be appropriate if I wanted to use a bowl and got a bowl, but if I wanted to wear a pair of pants and got three good blankets, I wouldn't be happy. Everyone's thinking was clear, and they distributed the 130 mu of land that came out of this struggle to 80 farmers who lacked land according to the principle of filling in the gaps and making up for deficiencies. More than 30 middle peasant households who had originally received the fruits voluntarily took out the fruits, and even composed a song saying: "Those with too much should be conscious and voluntarily withdraw! Fill in the gaps for households with little land, and supplement the poorest people..."

The "Peasant University" was open for a total of three days. It was almost the lunar new year, and the more than 300 first-term "graduates" went back to their respective homes to be "teachers", helping their wives and husbands brainwash, and preparing for the movement to thoroughly celebrate when they completely turned over. Then they would run the second term of the "Peasant University."

V. A Little Explanation

Just as the reporter was about to finish, Comrade Yu Guang said that he hoped to add a little explanation, that is, Nanjingse had created many valuable experiences in this in-depth movement, which promoted the 7th and 8th districts and Lin County. But there were still shortcomings. First, the relationship between cadres and the people had not been completely resolved like in Ren Village (another article). Second, because the land had been changed last year, although it had basically achieved an average of two mu of land per person, it still contained the issue of internal adjustment, which was left to be completely resolved in the next step.

　　南景色的“农民大学”
    （本报记者展潮）
    南景色的“农民大学”，是深入土地改革运动中，农民自我进行系统的翻身教育的天才创造。
            一、引子
    说起南景色村办“农民大学”的事，其中有一段来历。
    南景色是林县横水区的“一等村”。这个村的工作基础的确是比较好的。一九四四年水（横水）林（县）公路解放后，第一个搞斗争的就是南景色；在这次深入土地改革运动以前，搞斗争最多的也是南景色—五个自然村一共搞了一百一十多次斗争，特别是去年春天的一段斗争，土地大部都变动了，还“澄”出了三十多特务；说到交公粮、参战、参军，那一样不是百分之百的完成任务？“过路军人招待所”的工作，还受过表扬哩！因此，干部积极分子都很自满，区上也觉得这个村的运动就是“差不多”了。
    今年元月初，七、八区干部在南景色开联席会，讨论深入运动问题，当时大家都把眼光集中到落后村，南景色等“差不多”（这类村子在横水区占的比重较大）的村庄，似乎只掉下转入生产运动的问题了。但是，当时负责领导七、八区工作的县委余光同志，从他的实际考察中证明并不是这样，所谓“差不多”的村庄，问题还不少。他便亲自动手检查南景色的工作，专门找贫雇抗属谈话，发现村干部开会回来没有向群众宣传土地改革“填平补齐”，只有少数干部领导着“反”特务。群众反映“反特不如‘澄’老财”，政治主任秦五成说：“哼！你们眼光不明，人家打黑枪，你们还看不见？”其他干部虽没有全跟秦五成跑，却觉得“老财油水不大了，再斗就斗到中农头上了！”“填平补齐咱也要不上，叫没翻身的人干吧！”还说：“你们打先锋，俺在后面给您拉后手！”采取消极观望态度。当县区干部挨门挨户访问的时候，抗属吾成嫂就诉说开了，她说：“俺过去在大会上提三、四次意见，都叫干部顶回来了。说是小意见，说不说吧！”一个老实农民说：“八路军来那年，富农常建文、秦建平领着“胡掳队”抢他家东西，他秘密到西边报告八路军，秦建平又引上西良村土匪“胡、掳队”把他家三口人杀了！他说：“俺过去不敢提，是怕人家不行俺！这回俺倒不怕‘变天’，就怕提出不给俺解决！”一共检查出十五户贫农，还有八家逃荒回来的户口，缺房子少地的。根据这些事实，便召开了个干部老积极分子会，叫大家回想回想：咱是怎样斗争起来的？开始干部们都摆功劳，不服气的说：“那时候，日夜背枪打‘胡掳队’是咱这伙积极分子，后来斗争地主老财，那回又不是咱这伙人领头干？这时候他都忘本啦！提开意见啦！”领导上首先肯定表扬了大家的功劳，然后引到大家讨论：咱翻透身没有？谁们还没有翻身？这时候，便把新老积极分子召集在一起开会，一致认为必须团结起来，向地主老财来一次总清算才能翻透身。组织检查组到各街各户一边检查一边诉苦，一下子就围拢了四十多户没翻透身的人，搜集了四百多条意见，连中农也提开意见了，老积极分子看见新积极分子干得红，劲头也鼓起来了，当场向群众宣誓：“不怕，大家斗争吧，由俺作主，坚决干到的！”大运动开始了。
            二、成立“翻身团”
    大运动开始的时候，有人提议组织翻身工作队，群众说：“哼！咱不叫工作队，东面有‘还乡团’，咱成立‘翻身团’吧！”“对！”“对！”一时功劳簿、诉苦部、发言处，都成立起来了，不分黑明白夜！挂起灯笼干开啦。大家说：公开明干吧，反正土地是咱们的，应该归回来，叫咱们当家吧。
    由群众选举和自动报名出来的五十来个“翻身团”干部，领导着三百多个积极分子，深入到各街各户宣传：“现在咱政策法令变啦，过去没说够的还能说，没有得利的还能得！“这是最后一次斗争，不要误了好机会！”有人问：“小意见能不能提？”贫雇积极分子说：“哼，小意见是正经大痛苦！过去地主老财打死俺男人扣了我二亩好地，用五斗米就给完了片！不怕，有意见就提吧！”
    “减租的时候俺只退了二年租，这个能提不能？”
    “能！”
    俺对五大户没有意见了，对中农有意见能提不能提？”
    “能！”
    “对村干部、区干部有意见能不能提？”
    “能！”
    “俺爹死的时候俺还小，约莫还记得一点能提不能？”
    “能！”
    “对外村地主减租没算清帐，现在还往俺偷要利啦！能不能重算？”
    “能！”
    开始酝酿的时候，还有极少数“落后”农民不说话，新起的贫雇积极分子便劝他说：“你不要吊死鬼喝凉水，吃粗糠屙棒棰啦！”“怕啥哩？既要干莫要算，打破头皮不怕房扇子扇！”群众嚷嚷说：“日他娘还讲啥客气，讲啥情面？”“人家地主吃他妈的肥得快倒了，咱瘦得快死了”！“地主的富和贵，说是咱受过的罪！他一块地一张票，都是咱的血和汗！咱不敢要回来，还讲啥条件？咱穷他富就是最合理的大条件！有意见请说啦！”形成一个群众性的发动落后运动。
    大会诉苦以前，“翻身团”便检讨了过去的败症（缺点）：先找好目标再斗争，群众怒气出不尽，心衰不痛快。这次决定大胆放手让群众诉苦提意见，在斗争中分别对象。提出“啥苦都能诉，无论对谁有意见都能提”的口号，听见了这，在外村当雇工的也回来了，逃荒户也回来了，病人也骑上毛驴赶来了。苦引苦，意见牵意见，一面诉苦、一面分析、一面斗争、一面算帐澄财产，整整闹了五天。一共提出一千多件问题，“澄”出了二十一户，（其中有十户是中农），“翻身团”干部积极分子便给他们开会说：“提意见是为了洗脸擦黑，为了好，不要害怕，给干部不是一样提意见？”特别是看到头二等对象里面没有他们（头二等都是封建、富农、特务），既不挨打又不戴高帽子讨保训押，这十来户中农放心了，他们说：“过去说是贫中农是一家，心里总有点不自然，这回把事情都‘澄展’了，再没有比这还痛快了！”很多中农都自动把替地主封建富农隐藏的东西拿出来，交给“翻身团”，二十来个中农参加了农会。诉苦过程中，还单独召开了一次贫雇妇女积极分子会议，并提出“妇女不发言，地主‘澄’不展！妇女不翻身，男人翻身才一半！”使男人积极支援妇女、把最落后的一层也发动起来了。贫雇农男女共起来一百六十七个，涌现出四十多个新积极分子。
            三、群众自动要求“换脑筋”
    诉苦斗争提高了群众，也锻炼了干部教育了党员。党的支部便开始讨论，咱们共产党既为群众服务为群众谋利，大了好还是小了好？说大了好。又讨论为啥咱村支部没有发展？是不是没有合适对象？说不是的。论成分，有比咱好的雇农；论斗争，比咱还敢斗；论团结，人家比咱还有群众。但是为什么不发展呢？有的说，因他们进来提意见顶了自己；有的说，怕人家“口松”不可靠，暴露了自己，因此连群众想知道共产党的事也不敢说。经过检讨，便决定在农会里面在群众中间公开讨论党，大家都说开啦：“从前在旧社会里走头无路，咱穷人有各种各样想法，有的要饭走到地主家门口想：‘人家吃不了喂了猪，有朝一日，咱能吃上这一顿就好啦！’有的想：‘咱有朝一日得了帝，非把老财用枪嘣了不行’！‘有朝一日俺当了官，非给大伙谋利不行！’看见地主骑着高骡大马，心想：‘咱不要牲口也行，只要少受点罪就好了’！‘俺倒不要紧，只要能把俺娘养活了才好！”甚至想：“跌一交拾起个元宝才好！’……虽有各种想头，谁都没有办法，旧社会逼你当小偷、当土匪！上吊、饿死！今天有了共产党领导咱们大家，有了斗争的明路，你看看今天是‘有朝一日’不是？！共产党的主张就是咱群众们的心事。”
    人们接着往下说：“得了东西光怕老蒋过来抢了，心想怎能把蒋介石打败了才好，恰巧共产党今天就领导咱大家打老蒋，保卫好时光，你看得劲不得劲？！痛快不痛快？！”接着便讨论谁是共产党？有人说八路军，有人说干部，有人说农会，另一个人反驳说：要是农会，咱们不都是共产党了吗？再一个人起来证明说，都不对，便民国廿四年在太原亲眼见过共产党，是戴火车头帽的。……大家议论纷纷，总之觉得共产党好，说共产党办的都是咱心上的事，要求在党，但又不知上那里找。县委便给大家解释说：村村都有共产党，共产的老根就是群众，谁能给群众办事办得好就能在共产党，大家才恍然大悟。××个新积极分子党员更积极要求知道：“怎样才能为群众服务？怎样才能真正成为群众的勤务员？新农会会员、新妇联会会员，都积极要求知道农会妇联会里边的事，倒的将来干到那里？特别是这时候出了一件事，县区村干部都主张按需要分配斗争果实，群众却非主张抽纸条不行，还说：你们都说民主、群众路线，怎又不让俺都作主？干部说：你们说怎就怎吧。阴历腊月二十二那天早上，在南景色村边十一亩地大一块场上，斗争果实花红柳绿的摆了一大片，群众都高高兴兴的去赶“斗争果实会”，结果一个中农想要个花布做衣裳，抽纸条却抽着缸炒面，一个贫农想要点碎布棉套缝被子，却抽到了一副板，没有一个人满意的，却又不能埋怨干部，大家说：“这不行呀，咱得训练训练，换换脑筋吧！”
            四、“农民大学”开课了
    “换开脑筋，去县里受训吧，太远！咱就自己开两天学吧，谁愿意开脑筋谁就进来。”一来来了三百多人，自己拿干粮带给养，在一块吃“翻身饭”。都说：“龙门寺以前人家地主老财办师范，咱这回开农民大学。有人主张叫自训班，大家说“咱还是办“农民大学”吧。咱这个大学，地主老财想入学都不行，他不懂得咱的道理。”
    “农民大学”就这样开课了，没有教员，自己教自己。村长担任校长，政治主任当政治教员，各干部也都分了工，进行当中，先觉悟的和后觉悟的会员，反过来又是干部的教员，同时新老会员新老党员互学互教。大学里分成农会、妇女、民兵、党员四个班。民主选举了班长、组长。接着就是集体讨论课程，“先说说农会的课吧！从前老社会咱能不能起斗争？为啥有人斗争积极有人不积极？这就是第一课，叫大家都说说”，大家就说开啦：“没有共产党就没有咱！以前咱都当匠人，修好高楼大院咱住不上，现在都成咱自己的啦，你看多得！”“以前不知道咱有这大力量，想翻身离开斗争万不能！”……民兵第一课是讨论：“为啥有八路军咱老百姓还要拿枪？咱为谁干？和谁作斗？”明确了为大家为自己老婆孩子和地主老蒋作斗，检讨了“比老百姓高一等”的特殊思想。党员主要是说各人为啥要在党？在了党打算干些啥？怎样爱护群众爱护民兵为群众服务？妇女班的课题是：咱妇女以前受罪是谁给的？为啥咱男人骂老婆打孩子？许多在过“悄悄道”、在过“黄道”的妇女都说啦：“嘿！咱过去穷，在这也不顶事！该死、该死！俺不在啦！俺要俺子孙后代永远跟着共产党毛主席走”！有几个女军属说：“俺这回可是满心自愿啦，过去男人孩子参军心里总有点不痛快。这回不啦！”吾成嫂连第二个孩子也要送去参军。在学习的过程中，有家军属娶亲，妇女们还自动抬轿，给军属建立家务，踏雪到三四十里以外去给军队送柴。把过路军人招待所整理得好好的。
    紧跟着是四个班在一起上大课，互相谈心，表扬了农会里三、四十个积极分子，提到政治主任秦五成，都说：“五成虽然有败症，态度不好，可是人家坚决，眼明手快。”武装及各系统五相征求意见，解了“圪塔”。大家的结论是：没有共产党，咱永远不能翻身，只有自己起来坚决斗争，地主元宝四整的大块好地就是咱们的。要保卫斗争果实只有自己干，把拥军优军参军参战作好，全村更要团结成一盘机器，就好像打仗一样，有步兵、有炮兵、有机关枪，还得要有领导，连村指挥按在什么地方，也讨论好了。
    最后一课，就是集体讨论斗争果实分配问题。课目叫做“怨谁的过”？都说：还是人家干部说的对，按需要分配，咱一时想不开，觉得谁都愿意要好的，坏的谁要？结果只有一个民兵汉子拿了条花棉被，老婆拿了个好褥子、两口子恰对好了，其余谁都不合适。打比说按需要分配，俺等着用个碗，分到碗恰合适，俺想穿条裤，分到三床好毡，俺就不如意。大家思想通了，便把这次斗争出来的一百三十亩地，按填平补齐的原则分给八十户缺地的农民，原先分得到果实的三十多户中农，自动把果实拿出来，还编了个歌子说：“过多的要自觉，自动退出来！填平少地户，补给最穷人……”。
    “农大”一共开了三天，快过阴历年了，三百多个第一期“毕业生”，便分头回到各家去当“教员”，帮助自己家老婆、汉们开脑筋，准备运动彻底庆祝翻透身的时候。再办第二期“农民大学”。
            五、一点说明
    记者正待要收稍的时候，余光同志说，他希望附加一点说明，就是南景色在这次深入运动中，创造了许多宝贵经验，推动了七、八区和林县。但是还有缺点，一是干民关系还没像任村（另文）那样彻底解决，一是因为土地去年就变动了，现在虽然大体做到每人平均二亩地，但还包含着个内部调剂问题，留待下一步彻底解决。
