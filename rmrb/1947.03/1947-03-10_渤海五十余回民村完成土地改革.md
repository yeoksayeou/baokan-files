Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 6th. Over fifty Hui villages in Jingyuan, Qingyun, Zhenhua, Wuqiao, Deping and other counties in the Bohai area have completed land reform. Over 1,500 Hui households have obtained land. In Li Jiasi, the fourth district of Deping alone, over 300 Hui households have been allocated over 600 mu of land and over 50 rooms. In Jingyuan and Shangcun, each person was allocated 1.6 mu of land. In Dingjiabu Village, Qingyun, each person received as much as 2.8 mu. Even in Changjia Village, where land is scarce, absolute poverty has been eliminated. After the land returned home, the appearance of each village was renewed. The fourth district of Deping immediately implemented rural self-government. Hui people in each village enthusiastically participated in the election and elected two county councilors and four district committee members. Self-government organs, such as the Women's Association, etc., have been universally established in each village, and a Hui militia squadron has been organized. There are five Islamic primary schools.
