　　The First Day Since the Creation of the World
    Huguan Chengguan Peasants Hold Overthrow Parade
    [Our Newspaper, Huguan] After the victory of land reform in Chengnanguan, a celebration meeting for all the peasants who had overthrown the old order was held on the 20th of last month. On the morning of that day, as soon as the bell rang, the peasants who had overthrown the old order were either carrying the quilts they had been given, or wearing the clothes they had been given. The activists, like Lian Bu’ao, had shaved their beards and were wearing new headscarves. Old logistics worker Chen Yerong, wearing a new set of clothes, looked like a new son-in-law. Li Jubao's wife, wearing new clothes, wore the shiny satin she had been given in a cross, like a new bride. Guan Shuangren's child, a family member of a soldier, was smiling and jumping. Someone asked him, "Who gave you the fancy clothes?" He pointed to the large portrait of Chairman Mao and said, "He" gave them to me. Wang Sanlao's wife, a 76-year-old widow, was wearing the clothes for the elderly that she had been given. When everyone saw her, they laughed and said that the old lady had truly overthrown the old order. In the celebration parade, several treacherous landlord tyrants were at the front, carrying wooden shovels on their shoulders, with ditties written for them by the masses pasted on them, reciting in the streets: "I am the Second Emperor of Nanguan, my nickname is Chen Dongjing, I am a corrupt and extortionate tyrant, using big bushels and small scales to cheat people, I can make children cry, if they don't eat my Dongjing's grain." Another one recited: "Chen Ernv is a bad partner, with two weights on one scale, relying on my wealth and power, the peasants I exploit cannot survive, I am the first to exploit people..." The mass parade was filled with gongs and drums, performing various stilt stories, singing and entertaining themselves. They also held high a large red flag with the words "Now the world has changed, Chairman Mao leads us to have rights, old peasants have land, this is truly a joyful event." A giant portrait of Chairman Mao was held high in the crowd, cheering: "Overthrowing the old order, we must not forget Chairman Mao, listen to his call and follow him." Granny Wang couldn't walk, so she sat in a cart to participate in the parade. Whenever she saw someone, she shouted: "My old woman has overthrown the old order! If it weren't for Chairman Mao, I would have died long ago!" The whole village, old and young, embraced Chairman Mao's portrait and shouted: "Everyone united, our strength is great, overthrow the landlords and tyrants, if we want to thoroughly overthrow the old order, defeat the old roots of the landlords (referring to Chiang Kai-shek)." The peasants cheered to their hearts' content, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the old peasants who have overthrown the old order!" After the parade, everyone pondered that this was the first day since the creation of the world.
