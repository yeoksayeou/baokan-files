    Bohai Newly Recovered Areas
    Actively Carry Out Land Reform
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 27th] The Bohai area is actively carrying out land reform in the newly recovered areas. The Jinan local armed forces advanced to the periphery of Tianjin near Xiaozhan and Jinghai, attacking the Chiang army. The rear implemented the policy of "one hand holding a gun, the other distributing land." In a certain two districts of Jinan (new county), more than fifty villages have now completed land redistribution. According to statistics from fifteen villages including Qijiayao: more than 27,000 mu of land, more than 300 houses, and more than 20,000 jin of grain have been recovered from local despots and landlords. At the same time, two home-defense brigades were established, and militia organizations were also widely formed. The CCP Bohai Third Sub-district Committee transferred a large number of strong cadres and more than 300 emancipated activists from old areas such as Guangrao and Boxing to the newly recovered areas of Changshan, Zouping, and Huantai counties to carry out land reform. The Zouping County Committee convened a meeting of major county and district cadres on the 4th of this month, demanding that all actions be taken before the Qingming Festival. Huantai divided more than 40 villages in the Jinling area into seven joint defense zones and established core leadership.
