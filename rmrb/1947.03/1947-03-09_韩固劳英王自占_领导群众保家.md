　　[Report from this newspaper's office in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 7th] Wang Zizhan, a labor hero from Han Gu Village in Nanle County, actively led the masses to persist in the struggle against the enemy and defend the fruits of their liberation. When the enemy advanced into the Qingfeng-Nanle border area, Wang Zizhan first gathered the militia and engaged the enemy in guerrilla warfare, stipulating that the militia would not leave the village unless the enemy entered it. If the enemy occupied the village, they would combine forces in the district. He also mobilized and organized thirty-four old men who decided among themselves that they would say nothing if the enemy came, even if it meant death. The landlords who had been struggled against saw that the villagers were all organized and secretly contemplated, "The Japanese made trouble for eight or nine years, but the Eighth Route Army only grew stronger. Although we have been struggled against, we can still live, but we dare not stir up too much trouble." The enemy's first attack on Qingfeng saw small units operating in the southern part of the Second District, and the bad elements in the village did not dare to act, nor did the "Homecoming Legion" dare to enter the village. After the enemy occupied the village, Wang Zizhan took the militia to the district to regroup. Chiang's army captured Li Erzhao and asked him where the militia village cadres were. Erzhao said, "I don't know." Chiang's army tied him up, and he said, "Anyway, I will die before I speak. I am seventy or eighty years old, do I still want to live for another seventy or eighty?" The enemy left helplessly.

　　韩固劳英王自占
    领导群众保家
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】南乐韩固村劳动英雄王自占，积极领导群众坚持对敌斗争，保卫了翻身果实。当敌人进占清（丰）南（乐）边境时，王自占首先召集民兵和敌人打麻雀战，约定：敌人不进村，民兵不出村。敌人把村子占了，就到区里结合。又动员组织起三十四个老头子、他们自己规定：敌人来了啥也不说，打死也不说。被斗户见村里的人都已组织起来，就暗里酝酿：“日本人闹了八九年，八路军还是越来越多。咱虽说叫斗了，还算能活，可不敢多惹事了。”敌人第一次进攻清丰，小部队活动到二区南部，村里坏蛋没敢动，“还乡团”也没敢进村。敌人进占该村后，王自占带着民兵到区里集中，蒋军抓住李二照问民兵村干部在那里，二照说：“不知道。”蒋军把他捆起来，他说：“反正我死也不说，我七八十啦，难道还活七八十？”敌人无可奈何的走了。
