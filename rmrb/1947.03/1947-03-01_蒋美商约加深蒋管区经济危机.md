　　The US-Chiang Commercial Treaty Deepens the Economic Crisis in the Chiang-Controlled Areas
    Wang Zhongqing
   (I) The US and Chiang Have Been Colluding for a Long Time
    The Sino-American Commercial Treaty was signed on November 4th of last year, but Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of China and the US reactionaries' plot to colonize China have a long history. As early as the signing of the Sino-American New Treaty in 1943, the United States adopted a hypocritical attitude similar to that towards the Philippines, plotting to control China's economy after the war. First, it established the Sino-American Foreign Exchange Fund, making Chinese currency break away from the Sterling bloc and enter the Dollar bloc. Then, it sent Nelson and Henderson to China to investigate Chinese industry, established the "Wartime Production Bureau," and generated a "Chinese Industrialization Plan" based on American investment in China. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the United States planned to expand its total exports to China from about 2.5% before the war to 24%. Chiang Kai-shek also followed the intention of US imperialism, opening the inland river navigation of Jing (Nanjing), Wu (Wuhu), Xun (Jiujiang), and Han (Hankou), with the national Director-General of Customs being headed by the American L. T. Lydd, specially allowing Chennault to engage in shipping in China. Comprador bureaucrats colluded with imperialist elements to organize import and export companies (such as Yangzi Jianye Company, owned by Kong Xiangxi's son, the import and export trading companies of Song Ziwen and Song Ziliang, Jinshan Company, Lida Company, and Sino-American Industrial Company jointly operated with Chennault), preparing institutions for promoting American goods. The Sino-American Business Association (the headquarters for investment in China, organized in New York) also actively prepared to build petroleum, cotton yarn, shipbuilding, electrical, chemical, cement, and other factories in China last year to realize its long-established large-scale investment plan. With the promulgation of the new Company Law, it paved the way for American capital to invest in China, allowing companies to be established in China to specialize in Chinese industries, regardless of whether foreign capital had a parent company in its home country. This was already a situation of simultaneous commodity and capital input, but Chiang Kai-shek still felt it was not enough, and last year, he signed this unprecedented treaty of national betrayal. At this point, the ugly faces of the US and Chiang colluding and stealing and selling China's territorial sovereignty have been fully exposed!
  (II) Chiang Kai-shek Sells Out Everything of the Chinese People
    If Chiang Kai-shek's treaty of national betrayal is fully implemented, it will plunge the Chinese nation into eternal doom, and the Chinese people will forever be slaves and beasts of burden of US imperialism. Articles 2 to 5 of the treaty stipulate that "this party" (referring to the United States) may engage in commerce in "the other party" (referring to China), establish factories alone or in cooperation with the other party in the other party, and operate various enterprises. The scope of trade includes agricultural products, minerals, and industrial products, and the scope of enterprises includes commercial firms, factories (manufacturing and processing), scientific research, education, religious and charitable undertakings. China will be completely open in this wide range. Americans and their legal entities enjoy various economic rights and preferential treatment in China, formally the same as the Chinese, but in essence, they surpass and overwhelm the Chinese in everything. According to the second paragraph of Article 2, any "legal persons and organizations" legally organized in the United States must also be legal in China, not only in terms of undertakings but also in terms of occupations. These few articles alone are enough to control China's economy. The Chinese people have only one way out: bankruptcy, unemployment, and becoming slaves. What's more, there are more than twenty other well-thought-out and meticulous clauses? Therefore:
    1. National industry will be strangled to death by American goods. China's national industry was very fragile before the war. Foreign capital occupied a controlling position, with British capital reaching more than 26 million pounds, US capital reaching 290 million US dollars, and Japanese capital reaching more than 11.2 billion yen in the Northeast. After the Anti-Japanese War, British and American capital reduced their activities, and the occupied areas were completely controlled by Japanese capital. Around 1941, the national capital in the Great Rear Area had a short-term boom, but it was soon ravaged by comprador bureaucrat capital. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, American capital and goods completely dominated the Chinese market, and factories in the Chiang-controlled areas collapsed one after another. According to Li Xiang's research, from August of the previous year to May of last year, "a total of 363 factories changed in Chongqing, of which 19 were changed due to relocation and increased capital, and the remaining 95% were closed due to their inability to continue production." According to the Chongqing Business Daily on November 5th last year, "According to reliable statistics, there were more than 1,650 factories in Sichuan at the time of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and 40% of them have closed down due to the recession in the past year since the victory, and 35% are struggling." "There are more than 1,800 factories in the Shanghai Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Association, including textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, leather making, oil refining, alcohol, machinery, and other industries. Now, 80% of them are closed, and the rest are partially suspended." In the future, the provisions of Articles 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the treaty of national betrayal, which stipulate that American capital can be imported into China in large quantities to manufacture various commodities (in fact, it has already been implemented), will be implemented, and national industry will really only have one way to die.
    2. Agriculture is even more bankrupt. Last year, the Chiang-controlled areas suffered severe disasters. The disaster areas covered 19 provinces, with 100 million disaster victims and more than 75 million mu of wasteland. After the autumn harvest, the situation did not improve much. Under the burden of requisition, lending, high rent, usury, exorbitant taxes, and military disasters, farmers could not afford to save their lives and were unable to produce. Tea, silk, tung oil, cotton, medicinal materials, wool, pig bristles, and other sideline industries also went bankrupt one after another, while American agricultural products flowed in continuously. According to customs statistics from January to September last year, American goods accounted for more than 570 million yuan out of the total import value of more than 990 million yuan, and among American goods, agricultural products such as cotton, fruits, vegetables, grains, and tobacco alone accounted for more than 150 million yuan. Now, the treaty of national betrayal stipulates that American "legal persons and organizations" can plant, process, and purchase movable and immovable property in China, and can invest in agriculture, etc. Will China's technologically inferior agriculture not become even more bankrupt, and still be able to compete with it?
    3. Chinese merchants can only be compradors and shop assistants. According to Articles 9 to 20 of the US-Chiang Commercial Treaty, the inventions, trademarks, and trade names of "this country" people should be effectively protected, the tax standards for "this country" people should be the same as those for "the other country" people, and "no tax, fee, or expense" should be "different from or higher than that of the other country's nationals." "No exports or imports may be prohibited," "the customs duties levied and the methods of collection shall be treated the same as those of nationals," and "inland taxes" shall also be "granted no less favorable treatment than that now or hereafter granted to the same plants, products, or manufactures of the other Contracting Party." From Articles 21 to 24, the provisions on shipping stipulate that American ships can navigate to all open ports, one ship can dock at several ports, can load and unload goods along the way, and can freely choose shortcuts, "without being subject to any transit tax." "The ships and cargoes of this Contracting Party shall, in the ports, places, and territorial waters of the other Contracting Party, irrespective of the port of departure of the ship or the place of origin and destination of the cargo, be accorded in all respects treatment no less favorable than that accorded by that other Contracting Party to its own ships and cargoes"! In this way, China's tariffs, even the last bit of cover, have been removed, and China's dying shipping industry will never have hope of revival. Under the same treatment between Chinese and American merchants, how can opening shops and doing business compete with American merchants? Not only the import and export industry, due to the large funds and low interest rates of American merchants, cannot compete with them, but even general merchants will have to be compradors and shop assistants for American merchants.
  (III) The Chinese People Will Never Be Colonial Slaves!
    However, no matter how clever the US and Chiang reactionaries calculate, the Chinese people will never allow Chiang Kai-shek to sell them out and become colonial slaves of US imperialism. Yuan Shikai wanted to be emperor and signed the "Twenty-One Demands" with Japanese imperialism. Wang Jingwei became a puppet emperor of the Japanese invaders and signed the traitorous Wang-Japan secret treaty. But the Chinese people used their own strength to defeat the Japanese imperialists and smash these traitorous treaties. Today, the democratic forces of the Chinese people are stronger than ever before in the Yuan Shikai period and the Anti-Japanese War period. They have the confidence and strength to abolish this shameful US-Chiang Commercial Treaty, just like abolishing all unequal treaties in the past. Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei's fate will be a good example for Chiang Kai-shek!

　　蒋美商约加深蒋管区经济危机
    王中青
   （一）美蒋狼狈为奸由来已久
    中美商约是去年十一月四日签字的，但蒋介石卖国、美国反动派阴谋殖民地化中国却是由来已久。当民国三十二年一日签订中美新约时，美国便采取了像对待菲律宾一样的伪善态度，阴谋战后掌握中国的经济，首先成立中美外汇基金，使中国货币脱出英镑集团，投入美元集团。接着又派纳尔逊、韩德逊来华考察中国工业，成立“战时生产局”，并产生了一个以美国投资中国为前提的“中国工业化计划”。抗战胜利后，美国计划扩张对华输出总额由战前的百分之二·五左右，增加到百分之二十四。蒋介石也就仰承美帝国主义的意旨，开放了京芜浔汉的内河航行，全国总税务司由美人李度主持，特准陈纳德在华经营航运。买办官僚们勾结帝国主义分子，纷纷组织进出口公司（孔祥熙之子的杨子建业公司、宋子文、宋子良的进出口贸易公司、金山公司、立达公司，与陈纳德合的中美实业公司等），更为推销美货准备好机构。而中美工商联合会（在纽约组织的对华投资的指挥部）为实现其早已订立的庞大投资计划，也在去年积极地在华筹建石油、棉纱、轮船制造、电气、化学、水泥等工厂。及至新公司法颁布后，更为美资投资中国开辟了坦途，不论外资在其本国有无总公司，都可在中国设立公司，专办中国实业。这已经是商品输入加资本输入双管齐下的局势了，但蒋介石仍以为未足竟于去年又签订了这个史无前例的卖国新约。至此，美蒋狼狈为奸，偷买偷卖中国领土主权的狰狞面目，已暴露无遗！
  （二）蒋介石出卖了中国人民的一切
    蒋介石的卖国新约如果全部实行，则将陷中华民族于万劫不复的境地，中国人民永为美帝国主义的奴隶牛马。该约的第二到第五条规定“此方”（指美国）可在“彼方”（指中国）经营商业，单独或与彼方合作在彼方开设工厂，及经营各种企业，贸易范围包括农产品、矿物及工业品，企业范围包括商行工厂（制造及加工）科学研究，教育、宗教及慈善事业，在这广泛范围内中国将无所不开放，美国人及其法人团体在中国所享受的各种经济上的权益与优待，形式上完全和中国人一样，实质上是一切超越并压倒中国的人。按照第二条第二项的规定，凡在美国依法组织的“法人及其团体”在中国也必然合法，不但事业如此，职业也如此。只这几条就足以控制中国的经济，中国人只有破产、失业、做奴隶的一途了，何况还有其余二十几条设想周祥无微不至的条款呢？因此：
    一、民族工业将被美货勒死。中国民族工业，战前就是很脆弱的。外国资本占了控制地位，英资达二万六千余镑，美国二万九千万美元，日资在东北即达十一万二千余万日元。抗战之后，英美资本缩小活动，沦陷区完全被日资所统制，大后方于三十年左右，民族资本曾有短期繁荣，但旋又被买办官僚资本所摧残了。抗战胜利之后，美资与美货完全霸占了中国市场，蒋管区工厂随之纷纷倒闭。据李翔氏的研究，从前年八月到去年五月，重庆“共有变动工厂三百六十三家，其中十九家，是因迁移增资变动的，其余百分之九十五是因无法继续生产而关门的”。又据去年十一月五日，重庆商务日报载：“抗战胜利时，四川工厂据可靠统计有一千六百五十余家，而胜利一年来因不景气倒闭者占百分之四十，百分之三十五在勉力挣扎”。“上海中小联合会会员工厂有一千八百余家，包括纺织、化工、制药、制革、炼油、酒精、机器等工业，现在有十分之八关门，其余在局部停工中”。将来卖国新约第二、三、四、五条规定的美国资本可大量输入中国设厂制造各种商品一实行（事实上已经实行了），民族工业，实在只有死路一条。
    二、农业更加破产。去年蒋管区灾荒严重时期，灾区遍及十九省，灾民一万万，荒地七万五千余万亩，秋收之后，情况无大改善，农民在征实征借、高租、高利贷、苛捐杂税，及兵灾之下，农民救死不赡，生产无力，茶、丝、桐油、棉花、药材、羊毛、猪鬃等副业亦相继破产，而美国农产品源源输入。据海关去年一月到九月的统计，进口货值九千九百余万万元中，美货达五千七百余万万元，而美国货中，仅棉花、果品、蔬菜、粮食、烟草等五项农产品，即达一千五百余万万元。现在卖国新约规定，美国的“法人及其团体”，可在中国种植、加工、购置动产不动产，可向农业投资等等。而技术低劣的中国农业，不更加破产，还能与之竞争？
    三、中国商人只好做买办伙计。按照蒋美商约第九条到二十条的规定，“此国”人的发明，商标及商号，应予以有效之保护，课税标准，“此国”人应与“彼国”人一样，不论“税金规费或费用”皆“不得异于或高于彼国国民”，“不论输出品或输入品，一概不可禁止”“所课关税及征收方法，应与本国人同样待遇”、“内地税”也“应给予不低于现在或将来所给予缔约彼方之同样种植物，出产物或制造品之待遇”，由二十一条到二十四条关于航业规定，凡是开放港口，美方皆可通航，一只船可停泊几个港口，可以沿途起卸货物，且可自由选择捷径，“不得课以任何过境税”，“缔约国此方之船泊及载货，在缔约国彼方之口岸，地方及领水内，不论船泊之出发口岸为何，亦不论载货之产地及目的地为何，在各方面概应给予不低于该缔约国彼方所给予的船泊及载货之待遇”！这样一来，中国的关税，连最后的一点遮栏也拆除掉了，奄奄一息的中国航业，亦将永无振作希望，华商与美商在同样待遇之下，开店做生意，怎能敌过美商呢？不但进出口业，由于美商资金大，利息小，无法与之竞争，就是一般商人也只好给美商做买办、做伙计了。
  （三）中国人民决不做殖民地奴隶！
    然而尽管美蒋反动派算盘算得怎样巧，中国人民决不会让蒋贼出卖，做美帝国主义的殖民地奴隶，袁世凯想做皇帝，和日本帝国主义签订了“二十一条”，汪精卫当了日寇的儿皇帝，订立了卖国的日汪密约，但中国人民用自己的力量，把日本帝国主义者打败了、粉碎了这些卖国条约；中国今天的人民民主力量，较之袁世凯时期，抗战时期，更加坚强无比了，有信心有力量来废除这个可耻的蒋美商约，像废除以往一切不平等条约一样，袁世凯、汪精卫的下场将是蒋贼的好榜样！
