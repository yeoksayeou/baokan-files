　　[This Newspaper, Jilu-Yu, 11th dispatch] The Jilu-Yu Daily recently published an editorial, condemning the shameless conspiracy of Chiang and the US to close the breach and release the flood, and calling on the people of the border region to rise up and save themselves. The editorial first pointed out: "Since the Chiang side violated the agreement and released water at the end of last year, starting in February of this year, they have become even more frantically destructive towards our river areas. Large numbers of planes are dispatched daily to indiscriminately bomb our dangerous works, ferry crossings, shipyards, and material yards, continuing for a month now. This has not only forced us to be unable to repair the dikes, but also destroyed many of the dangerous works that had already been completed, such as Shili Pu and Sun Kou. The amount of materials and manpower we have lost in repairing the river has exceeded the amount actually needed. Chiang Kai-shek is single-mindedly trying to put the people to death, and has even decided to close the breach and release the flood, inundating millions of people on the Jilu-Yu plain." The editorial pointed out: The people must firmly remember the crimes of the Chiang-American reactionaries and rise up urgently to save themselves: (1) Chiang Kai-shek's implementation of this unprecedentedly cruel and evil plan is also due to the vigorous assistance of American imperialism. The blocking project at Huayuankou has been fully supported with materials and equipment by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) under the direction of American personnel, and American personnel have also participated in the planning. American personnel, such as Tadd, also participated in the various agreements signed between Chiang's side and us. American imperialism and its executors must bear the same responsibility for Chiang's implementation of this poisonous plan. All of our losses suffered from the disaster must be settled with them in the future! In addition, those who resolutely implement Chiang's poisonous plan, such as Zhu Guangxiu, director of the Dike Closure Bureau, must also be judged and punished by the people in the future. (2) We must rely on our own efforts to eliminate the disaster. We must overcome all difficulties in the resolute conduct of the patriotic self-defense war, organize forces to repair dikes and rescue the endangered, build and repair ships, step up the relocation of residents in the riverbed, strictly protect the dikes, and plant willow trees everywhere on the dikes. If it cannot be done during the day, it can be done at night; if it cannot be done by concentrating a large number of people, it can be done in a decentralized manner; those who are carrying out land reform and serving war service and other work should schedule their time and relocate their manpower to actively carry out self-rescue.

　　冀鲁豫日报社论指出
    蒋美堵口放水罪恶必将遭到人民惩罚
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】冀鲁豫日报顷发表社论，斥责蒋美合龙放水的无耻阴谋、并号召边区人民奋起自救。社论首先指出：“自去年年底蒋方违约放水后，本年二月起又对我沿河更加疯狂破坏，每日出动大批飞机滥炸我险工渡口船厂料厂，迄今持续一月之久，不但迫使我无法抢修堤坝，且业已修成之险工如十里铺、孙口等多处亦被炸毁，我方修河物资及人力损失之数量，已超过实际所需要之数量。蒋贼一心一意置人民于死地，竟又决定合龙放水，淹害冀鲁豫平原千百万人民。”社论指出：人民必须牢记蒋美反动派的罪恶，并急起自救：（一）蒋介石实施这一旷占未有的残暴恶计，同时也是由于美帝国主义的大力帮助。花园口堵口工程是得到美籍主要人员主持的联总给以充分的物资器材的支持，并由美籍人员参预筹谋进行的，蒋方与我们签订历次协议，亦有美籍人员如塔德等参加，美帝国主义及其执行人对蒋贼实施这一毒计是要同负其责的。我们所有遭受灾害的损失，将来必须向他们清算索取！此外，坚决执行蒋贼这一毒计的如堵复局长朱光庥等，将来亦必须由人民来审判惩办。（二）灾害必须我们自力来消除。我们必须在坚决进行爱国自卫战争中克服一切困难，组织力量修堤抢险，赶造和修补船只，加紧迁移河床居民，严护堤坝，遍植堤柳。白天不能进行，可在夜间进行，不能集中大量人员进行的，可分散进行；正在进行土地改革与服务战勤及其他工作的应把时间排布开，把人力调迁好，积极进行自救。
