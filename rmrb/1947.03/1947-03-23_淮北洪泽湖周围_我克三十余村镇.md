Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st—Our guerrilla corps in the rear of the Chiang army in northern Huaihai have bravely attacked over the past half-month, liberating vast areas around Hongze Lake that had been occupied for nearly half a year. They captured and forced the retreat of Chiang army strongholds in important towns and villages such as Guirenji, Lufeng, Banchengzhen, Jinzhizhen, Nanxinji, Wangwei, Magongdian, and Renji, totaling more than thirty places. They captured 781 Chiang soldiers and killed or wounded 167.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st—Local armed forces and militia in Huaihai used "netting rabbits" tactics to eliminate 35 Chiang soldiers in 20 minutes who came out to harass. On the dawn of the 16th, a search platoon of the 484th Regiment of the 162nd Brigade of the Chiang Army's 44th Division, in full collaboration with the "Returning Home Corps," plundered westward from Zhangdu, on the Yanhai River line between Huaiyin and Lianshui. The local armed forces and militia in the area had already set up a dragnet. As soon as they entered the ambush site, they bravely charged forward and immediately ended the battle, capturing 19 people including the platoon leader, wounding 7, killing 9, and seizing all their weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st—A large number of young heroes have emerged in the guerrilla warfare in the Jiang-occupied areas of Yancheng and Funing. Han Xiubo, a 15-year-old child from a certain district of Sheyang County on the west bank of the Chuanchang River, attempted to steal a machine gun when the Chiang army came to his hometown, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness. Although he failed due to insufficient strength, he stole a bullet pouch, hid thirty rows of American-made 7.9mm bullets, and presented them to the democratic government. In early February, a unit of the Sheyang County guerrillas patrolled along the Sanchang River bank and encountered dozens of Chiang soldiers. At that time, the guerrilla scouts were too far forward, and after being discovered by the enemy, they were subjected to intense fire. The unit commander wanted to order them to move to a favorable position, but the adults were too large a target to move forward. Wang Datao, an eight-year-old child, volunteered to crawl through the rain of bullets to deliver the order to the sentry post. After moving to a new position, they fought fiercely for 20 minutes, repelling the Chiang soldiers. In this battle, two Chiang soldiers were wounded, and no one in the guerrilla team was injured.

    【新华社华中二十一日电】盐阜蒋占区游击战争中涌现大批小英雄。串场河西岸射阳县某区十五岁儿童韩修伯，在蒋军到他家乡时，乘敌不备想把机枪偷走，因体力不够未果，只偷出一子弹内袋，藏美造七九子弹三十排，献给民主政府。二月上旬，射阳县游击队一部沿三场河岸巡逻，遭遇蒋军数十名，当时游击队尖兵太突出，被敌发现后，即以猛烈火力射击，该部指挥官欲令其转移至有利阵地，但大人目标太大，无法前进，适有一个八岁小孩王大桃自愿在弹雨下匐伏至尖兵哨发传达命令，转移阵地后，激战二十分钟，将蒋军击退，是役击伤蒋军两名，游击队无一伤人。
