(Our newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 19th) In order to solve the financial difficulties before the dawn, Comrade Guo Zhichao, Secretary of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Eighth District Committee, called for production and thrift at the financial and economic meeting of the directly subordinate organs of the Special Commissioner's Office. Comrade Zhichao first pointed out that the Eighth District suffered a poor harvest last year and was also heavily looted by the enemy. A spring famine is very likely this year, so we must intensify thrift; at the same time, under the principle of not increasing the burden on the masses, we must support production, expand the collection area, and increase the wealth of the masses. The methods are: (1) The guiding ideology should focus on the most difficult aspects, the organizational structure should be streamlined as much as possible, and in terms of supply, the army should be prioritized over the local areas, and the front line over the rear. (2) Launch an economic struggle against the enemy and organize fiscal revenue. Improve the industrial and commercial departments, establish blockades, organize anti-smuggling teams, and cooperate with the militia to prevent smuggling and tax evasion. Stabilize prices, control markets, resist Chiang Kai-shek's currency, and consolidate the Ji currency. Issue loans to support production, relieve disaster victims, and revitalize the rural economy. The focus is on agriculture combined with household side occupations, such as the textile industry in Qingfeng, the oil pressing in Puyang, and the straw braid and small handicraft industries and small merchant shipping in Nanle and Qingfeng. Loans should be granted using simple methods with contracts and guarantors, lending and recovering simultaneously without stopping. (3) Reduce the burden on villages. At present, wartime service tasks are heavy, and village expenses sometimes exceed the amount of public grain. The masses should be inspired to supervise each other, and village expenditures must be approved by the district and announced once a month. The village expense burden per person per year should not exceed five catties of millet. If there are special circumstances that necessitate exceeding this limit, a request should be submitted to the Special Commissioner's Office for approval. (4) The issue of production by government organs is a major part of developing financial resources and ensuring self-sufficiency. Within the limits of laws and policies, and under the principle of benefiting both the public and private sectors and prioritizing the public sector, government organs should engage in production to improve the lives of cadres and reduce the burden on the people.

    冀鲁豫八专区规定
    村款开支经区批准
    启发群众互相监督
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】为解决黎明前财经困难，冀鲁豫八地委书记郭志超同志在专署直属机关财经会议上号召进行生产节约。志超同志首先指出八分区去年歉收，又遭敌人大肆抢掠，今年春荒很有可能，必须加紧节约；同时在不增加群众负担原则下，扶持生产，扩大征收面积，增加群众财富。其办法：（一）领导思想上应从最困难处着眼，组织机构应尽量紧缩，在供给上，先军队后地方，先前线后后方。（二）开展对敌经济斗争，组织财政收入。健全工商部门，建立封锁线，组织缉私组，配合民兵防止走私漏税。稳定物价，掌握集市，抵制蒋币，巩固冀钞。发放贷款，扶持生产，救济灾民，活跃农村经济。其中心是农业结合家庭副业，如清丰的纺织，濮县的打油，南（乐）清（丰）之草帽辫、小手工业、小商船运输。贷款应采用有契约有保人的简便办法，一面贷一面收，永不停止。（三）减轻村负担。目前战勤任务繁重，村款有的超过公粮数目，应启发群众互相监督，村开支必须经区批准，每月公布一次。每人每年村开支负担不得超过小米五斤，如有不得不超过的特殊情形，应呈请专署批准。（四）机关生产问题是开发财源保证自给自足的主要部分。在法令政策以内，公私两便、先公后私的原则下进行机关生产，改善干部生活，减轻人民负担。
