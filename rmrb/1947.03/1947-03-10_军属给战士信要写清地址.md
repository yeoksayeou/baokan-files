Military Families Should Clearly Write Addresses on Letters to Soldiers

To the Editor:

According to a letter from the post office: Recently, letters from military families to soldiers often cannot be delivered because the address is incomplete. Some only write "X Battalion, X Company," for example, "First Battalion, First Company." But which brigade and which regiment does this "First Battalion, First Company" belong to? Therefore, it cannot be found. In the future, please clearly write "X Column (or X Department), X Brigade, X Regiment, X Battalion, X Company." Some letters do not have a location; please pay attention to writing the location in the future. Also, some military families write to soldiers using their childhood nicknames, but in reality, they no longer go by that name, so they cannot be found. Therefore, please write the soldier's current name. Please publish this letter in the "Reader Service" column.

Sincerely,
The Political Department of the Military Region

　　军属给战士信要写清地址编辑同志：
    据邮局来函：近来常有军属给战士写的信找不到投寄的地方；有的只写×营×连收，如一营一连吧，究竟那个旅的那个团的一营一连呢？所以就找不到。以后写清×纵队（或×部门）×旅×团×营×连才行。有的信没有地点，以后也要注意写地点。还有的军属给战士写信，写他的小名，实际上他已不叫这名了，也找不到，所以要写战士现在的名子。此信请在“读者服务栏”刊登。此致敬礼
