    Shexian Normal School Entirely Joins the War Effort
    [This newspaper's Shexian dispatch] On the 18th of this month, all teachers and students of Shexian Normal School gathered to discuss how to "Defend Chairman Mao, defend ourselves." Student Wang Wenfang said: "Now that the army is fighting on the front lines, the people in the rear are enthusiastically supporting the front lines. I am determined to go to the front lines to work, even if it is just carrying stretchers." Female student Wang Yunqing said, "Although I cannot join the army, I can still be a nurse and donate the money I earn from making socks to the soldiers." After discussion, it was unanimously decided that all would join the war effort and participate in various front-line tasks. They will also donate 12,230 yuan of production profits to the front-line soldiers. After several days of preparation, they went to the front lines on the 23rd.

    涉县师范全体参战
    【本报涉县讯】涉县师范全体师生于本月十八日集会讨论如何“保卫毛主席，保卫自己”。同学王文芳说：“现在军队在前方打仗，后方老百姓都热烈支援前线，我要坚决上前方工作，那怕是抬担架也好。”女生王云清说“我虽不能参军，我还能当看护员，并把我做袜子赚的钱献给战士。”经过讨论，一致决定全体参战，参加前线各种工作。并将生产的红利捐出一万二千二百三十元，献给前方战士。经过数天的准备工作，已于二十三日走向前线。
