　　Eyewitness Account of Conscription in the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
    Tian Bing
    After the Lunar New Year, I followed the army to the areas of Zhecheng, Luyi, Suizhou, Ningling in Henan and Bozhou in Anhui. This is an area that Chiang Kai-shek has ravaged for a long time. There are very few strong young men in the villages, mostly women, the old and weak, or disabled young people. Every family lives in a low, dilapidated thatched cottage. Even if the landlord's wall collapses, it cannot be repaired. During the New Year, the windows of the main room were not covered with new paper. Although they wore long gowns for the New Year greetings, they were all greasy and tattered.

    Chiang Kai-shek demanded 120,000 conscripts from Henan, coupled with heavy burdens, the people's lives are not difficult to imagine. No matter which village you go to, you can hear about people cutting off their hands or their wives blinding their eyes to avoid military service. Stories of mistreatment of recruits are even more common. In Qinghe Garden, Pukou, Major Zhang Qicang of the 83rd Division received 150 conscripts from Qingjiang County on October 14 last year. Because desertion was rampant, he tied five people together with ropes and wrote the word "soldier" in large letters with red ink on their backs and clothes. When Luyi County and Ji Jinan's Li Jiazhai grabbed conscripts, those who were caught and wanted to escape were tied up, with four bricks placed under each hand and foot. A poor 19-year-old young man was crushed. A 60-year-old man in Ji was beaten forty times and fined 5 million yuan because he failed to catch his son. A conscript from Daxinji, Luyi, was getting married and was taken away before dawn. As a result, it cost 600,000 yuan to buy him back. Although the regulations stipulate that the age of conscripts is from fifteen to thirty-five, children as young as twelve or thirteen were also taken away.

    The conscription money is distributed layer by layer. If the Chiang Kai-shek county government wants fifty conscripts, the township head will ask for eighty. If it costs 400,000 yuan to buy a conscript, the township head and bao chief will ask for 600,000 yuan. Some of it went into their pockets, and some was used to bribe superiors. For example, Wang Dong, the township head of Beiwanglou in Zhecheng, hanged himself because he couldn't cope with the situation. This is an extremely small number of conscientious township heads. At the beginning, you could pay money to avoid conscription, but later, when the money ran out, people still had to go. So the poor people here have no way out, and the rich people are also getting poorer. Almost 90% of the rural land has been transferred to the township heads and jia chiefs. Zhang, the uncle of the puppet army, used to have only a few dozen acres of land, but now it has increased to 40 qing. ...

    For the sake of conscription, the township heads are very intimidating. In the countryside, the town head and township head are also called "Your Excellency." This is the "honorific title" used by the secret agents to address Chiang Kai-shek. Whoever uses it has to pay 500,000 yuan. Because when they call it, it is mostly to ask for exemption from conscription, first bribe them, and then respectfully ask "Your Excellency" to approve it.

　　蒋管区抓丁见闻
    田兵
    旧历年后我随军到了河南柘城、鹿邑、睢州、宁陵和安徽亳州一带。这是蒋介石蹂躏已久的地方，各村很少看见壮丁，大都是妇女老弱，或青年的残废人。每家都住在快要倒塌的低矮的茅屋内，就是地主倒了墙也修不起来。过年时，正堂屋的窗户也没糊上新纸。虽然他们贺年也穿着长衫，却都是油污破烂不堪。
    蒋介石向河南要十万二千壮丁，加上繁重的负担，人民的日子是不难想像的。无论走到那村，都可听到为了逃避兵役砍掉手或被妻子刺瞎眼睛的事情。虐待新兵的事更是随处可以听得到。在浦口庆和园八十三师少校张其仓，于去年十月十四日接收清江县壮丁一百五十名，因逃风甚炽，乃以绳索五人一绑，并用红墨水在背脊衣服上大书“兵”字。鹿邑县、汲济南李家寨抓壮丁时，被抓者想逃跑，便被捆起来，手脚各垫四块砖。可怜一位十九岁的青年便被压碎了。汲一位老先生六十岁了，因没有抓住他儿子，他被打了四十棍，还罚了五十万元。鹿邑大新集一个壮丁正结婚，天未明就被抓去了，结果花了六十万元才买回。虽说规定壮丁年龄是十五至三十五，但十二、三岁的娃娃也被抓走了。
    抓丁财一层层的发下去，假如蒋记县政府要五十个壮丁，乡长则要八十。假如四十万元买一个壮丁，乡保长就要六十万元。一部分落了腰包，一部贿赂上级。像柘城北王楼的王东乡乡长就是因为应付不了而自己上吊死，这是极少数有良心的乡长。开始抓丁还可以出钱，以后钱出完了，人还是得去。所以在这儿穷人没办法，富人也搞穷了。农村土地几乎百分之九十都转到了乡长甲长手里。伪军张的叔子过去只有几十亩地，现在增加到四十顷了。……
    为了抓丁，乡镇长的威风是很吓人的。在农村里，镇长、乡长也称“钧座”。这是特务们称呼蒋介石的“尊号”，谁称一下，还得出五十万元。因为称的时候，大都是为了请免征壮丁，先行贿赂，然后敬祈“钧座”核准的原故。
