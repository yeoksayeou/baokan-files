　　Public Grain Storage Method
    Zhou Yufu from Kang Village, Shahe County, is very effective in storing public grain. He stored forty dan of public grain without any loss. His method is to line the top and bottom of the grain bin with a foot-thick layer of chaff. The bottom is padded with straw mats or grass and supported by bricks, raised one foot above the ground. The house is entirely made of bricks, with the doorway blocked up. Only small holes are left in the walls. When taking grain, a bamboo tube is inserted, and the grain flows out through the tube. This prevents rats and birds, and also prevents moisture and rot.

　　公粮保存法
    沙河县康村周玉富，保存公粮很得法，他保存四十石公粮，一点都没损失。他的办法是席圈上下铺上一尺厚的糠，底下垫席或草，以砖支起，离地一尺高，房子完全用砖砌成，门口垒住，墙壁仅留小洞，取时用竹筒插入，粮食顺筒流出，既可防鼠，又可防雀，同时还不会潮湿腐烂。
