    Neiqiu Basically Completes Land Redistribution; Decides to Further Strive for Balance
    [Our Dispatch] After thorough and repeated land investigations since December of last year, Neiqiu farmers have recovered over 90,000 mu of land (approximately 35% of the total land in the new district), basically realizing "land to the tiller." Before the movement, poor peasants in Dongjie averaged one mu of land per person; now they have four mu. Middle peasants previously averaged 3.4 mu per person; now they have 3.7 mu. The emancipated peasants in the Second District have reached five to six mu per person. In the entire county's new district, emancipated peasants generally average over four mu per person, and feudal forces have been basically crushed. The remaining problems in the current movement are that the movement is not yet fully balanced, the feudal tails of more than a dozen villages have not been completely cut off, and some honest peasants have not been fully mobilized ideologically. To this end, the county and district cadres joint meeting at the beginning of the month specifically decided: (1) To continue in-depth investigation and supplementation, conduct in-depth ideological mobilization, and reorganize the organization. Adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses, convene training classes and symposiums for various classes, and carry out the conscious great unity movement of the peasant class. (2) To further delve into general villages, continue to dispatch cadres to make a concentrated push in "backward villages," leaving no feudal tails and ensuring that no peasant remains unemancipated. (3) Combining the investigation and supplementation movement, conduct education on production and wealth creation, break down ideological obstacles to production, restore production organizations, rectify mutual aid, and prepare for spring plowing. (Ziqi)
    [Our Dispatch from Neiqiu] During the recent investigation and supplementation movement in the Second District, many instances were exposed of landlords using "honey traps" to soften up cadres and activists, attempting to evade and undermine the mass struggle. For example, Ren Huchen, a landlord in Zhongcheng Village, instructed his daughter and daughter-in-law to win over the chairman of the Military Affairs Committee and the village chief, which has now been exposed by the masses. Li Keying, a landlord in Xiyongan, fearing mass struggle against him, attempted to promise his daughter to the son of the deputy village chief; a landlord in Shifang had his daughter seduce the militia instructor. These many misdeeds have now been exposed to the masses through struggle. Village cadres, activists, and the masses have all recognized the landlords' despicable conspiracies, saying, "We must be vigilant!" Village cadres and the masses are now continuing to carry out the struggle to thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants under the slogan of "find accurately" and "strike accurately." (Zhi'an)

    内邱大体完成填补
    决定再深入争取平衡
    【本报讯】内邱经过去年十二月以来的深入反复查田，农民共收回土地九万余亩（约占全新区土地百分之三十五），基本上实现了耕者有其田。东街运动前贫农每人平均一亩地，现在达到四亩；中农过去每人平均三亩四，现在达到三亩七，二区的翻身农民每人都达到五亩至六亩以上；全县新区一般翻身农民达到每人平均四亩以上，封建势力基本上已被打垮。目前运动中的遗留问题是运动还未完全平衡，还有十几个村的封建尾巴未彻底割掉，部分老实农民还没有完全从思想上发动起来。为此，月初县区干部联席会特决定：（一）继续深入查补，深入思想发动，整理组织。调整干群关系，召开各不同阶层的训练班、座谈会，开展农民阶级自觉的大团结运动。（二）一般村再深入，继续抽调干部突击“落后村”，不留一个封建尾巴，不留一个农民不翻身。（三）结合查补运动，进行生产发家教育，打破生产上的思想障碍，恢复生产组织，整顿互助，准备春耕。（子琦）
    【本报内邱讯】二区在最近查补运动中，揭发了不少地主用“美人计”软化干部和积极分子，企图逃避与破坏群众斗争。如中程村地主任虎辰，布置他闺女和儿媳妇拉拢武委会主任与村长，现已被群众揭发。西永安地主李克英怕群众斗争他，企图将闺女许给副村长的儿子；十方一个地主让自己闺女去勾搭民兵指导员。这许多劣迹，现都经过斗争，被暴露于群众之前。村干、积极分子与群众，都认清了地主的卑鄙阴谋，都说：“咱们可得警惕呀！”各村干部、群众现正在“找的到”“打的准”的口号下，继续开展彻底扫清封建残余的斗争。（治安）
