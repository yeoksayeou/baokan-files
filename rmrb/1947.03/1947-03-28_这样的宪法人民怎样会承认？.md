How Can the People Recognize Such a Constitution?
    Zhou Jianren

Mr. Zhou Jianren, the younger brother of Mr. Lu Xun, is now a democratic figure in the Great Rear Area. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he persisted in the resistance in the Great Rear Area, and after the war, he strongly advocated democracy. From this article, we not only understand his attitude towards the Kuomintang's constitution, but also hear the voice of the people in the Great Rear Area today.
    —Editor

The Political Consultative Conference was jointly organized by representatives of various parties and non-party figures. The entire Chinese people naturally regard it as a legitimate and democratic conference. The resolutions produced by this conference are naturally also considered legitimate and must be abided by. Therefore, proceeding according to the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference is the only legitimate path, and not proceeding according to these procedures is illegal. This is very basic common sense and need not be elaborated upon. Even in daily life, if a few individuals are jointly handling a matter, it would be very wrong if one party does not act according to the agreement afterward. How much more so in a major matter like nation-building? Once an agreement has been reached through consultation, it becomes the legal basis for all subsequent actions. What other legitimate path is there?

But I don't know how it happened, (on the surface, it seems it only took Marshall to take a trip to the United States) everything changed. Instead of following the Political Consultative Conference, the only legitimate and democratic path, suddenly, as if by a stage magic trick, the solemn undertaking of nation-building was instantly transformed into a playful sleight of hand. The Chinese people will certainly not abandon this solemn people's stance. In order to demand survival and progress, how can they be satisfied with watching magic tricks? Therefore, the "thing" that emerges from the magic-like transformation, calling it a "constitution," will not be recognized by the people. They will inevitably be the first to deny that it is a constitution. Many people's organizations have already published statements denying it.

Because what the people demand is actual democracy. People want to eat, want to wear clothes, want houses to live in, want the right to speak, want the right to elect trusted people to do various things, etc. (I can't elaborate here). They certainly don't just want a piece of empty paper, a blank check, or, for example, a food advertisement on the wall while they are starving at the foot of the wall. No one would be satisfied with such a life. Moreover, the Chinese people are now deeply sophisticated and very experienced, and they are not easily fooled again. The people need actual democracy, which means obtaining the power to live a democratic life. This is not like appreciating art, where hanging a painting or pasting a piece of wallpaper is enough to satisfy. Therefore, the "constitution" unilaterally manufactured without the Political Consultative Conference's procedures will not be recognized by everyone. Even if it is exactly the same as the Political Consultative Conference's draft constitution, or even more democratic than the Political Consultative Conference's draft constitution, the people will not recognize it. Because the people resolutely oppose a small group of people taking over and planning on their behalf, and this is indeed not something that can be taken over and planned on by others.

However, some overly "honest and good" people still have their minds filled with fetishistic ideas. It seems that once the articles of the constitution are written and passed, they will generate a kind of power and naturally have the ability to restrain, forgetting that the success or failure of things still requires flesh-and-blood people to do them, and empty words are ineffective. These people then think that having a constitution that is not very democratic, but at least close to democratic, is better than having none at all. Having this thing can at least be used as a basis. In fact, this is not the case at all. Others feel that "getting promoted and making a fortune" is important, and they have already become detached from the people. If they succeed in creating such a "constitution," they will have the opportunity to become officials or have land to acquire. Then, even fetishistic ideas are not needed. They will support this kind of "constitution." These people, what about national rights? Even if sovereignty is given away? What about the people's rights? Even if the people can survive? They don't care about any of these things. I would also like to ask those who hope that as long as there is a democratic constitution, democratic politics can gradually be realized, to look at the talk of Professor Zhang Zhirang, a legal scholar, to get a lot of warning. The January 1st "United Evening News" said:

    "Professor Zhang Zhirang of Fudan University said: 'The constitution passed this time is roughly the same as the draft proposed by the government, but compared with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, there are many inconsistencies, especially regarding the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, the relationship between the central government and local governments, the National Assembly issue, and the restrictions on people's freedom. These four items are particularly important. Therefore, to say that this constitution is based on the propositions of various parties and social notables is not actually the case.'"

Professor Zhang clearly stated that this "constitution" has "many inconsistencies" with the draft constitution of the Political Consultative Conference. It is not actually based on the draft constitution discussed by various parties and non-party figures. Many people, however, are under such a misbelief.

Also recently, the political scientist Professor Zhang Xiruo made the following comment in an interview with Mr. Hu Di, a reporter for the "United Evening News," regarding the "constitution":

    "This constitution has little to do with actual politics. It is just a trick played by the Kuomintang in the current stage of actual politics. There is a saying in Shanghai: it is a new gun technique, a new gun technique in a year of open struggle. It is of no great importance. This is an article and trick created by the Kuomintang in response to the times. It is just a minor detail in the political evolution of the Chinese people. It is okay to be happy to watch it, but it doesn't matter if you don't want to watch it."

If this explanation is not enough, you can also refer to other facts to see the signs of whether there is a democratic atmosphere.

    1. During the period when the "National Assembly" was being held and a one-sided "constitution" was being passed, the "United Evening News" on December 23rd of last year said: The Shanghai Municipal Police Department issued Instruction No. 16483, prohibiting the sale of about 50 kinds of magazines and books.
    2. Three days after the closure of this "National Assembly," that is, on December 28th of last year, the "United Evening News" said: Twenty-six kinds of publications in Chongqing were banned and sealed up by the municipal government.

Enough, there is no need to copy more. Judging from these two news items, if passing the "constitution" is really to implement democracy, why strengthen the suppression of freedom of speech and ban publications while "drafting the constitution"? Is it that when the "constitution" is being passed and after it has been passed, it is necessary to severely suppress freedom of speech? Is it that not doing so is not democratic? Does this undemocratic situation indicate that when the "constitution" is implemented, there will suddenly be a thunderclap and democracy will be everywhere?

No one will believe that democratic politics in the human world will appear so "miraculously."

Also, Marshall's "Statement on Leaving China" also talked about this "constitution" and said that it was "democratic." He did not support the Political Consultative Conference's road, in which he personally participated, but praised the "constitution" produced in violation of the Political Consultative Conference's road as "democratic." He said: "The National Assembly has formulated a democratic constitution, the main parts of which are in line with the principles resolved by the political consultative conference of various parties and factions in January last year..." The wording is very clever, making it difficult for people to grasp. On the one hand, it says "main parts," and on the other hand, it says "in line with the principles." It seems to be saying that it is very much in line, and it also seems to be not very much in line. Marshall's efforts have raised the awareness of the Chinese people, making the Chinese believe that it was wrong to think that they could help China's politics get on the path to democracy in the past.

Just look at the fact that although he has repeatedly criticized the powerful reactionary groups in the Kuomintang government, in fact, American policy has always been helping this kind of group. Moreover, he openly praised this thing that was passed, saying it was a democratic constitution, which is really incomprehensible. Marshall said that he could not get any truth from publishing this statement, which might make the truth even more blurred (he asked people to believe that the undemocratic and illegal "constitution" was legal and democratic).

    这样的宪法人民怎样会承认？
    周建人
    周建人先生，鲁迅先生之弟，现在是大后方的民主人士，抗战期间在大后方坚持抗战，抗战后则极力主张民主，从这篇文章，不仅使我们了解他对国民党宪法的态度，并且使我们听到了今天大后方人民的呼声。
    ——编者
    政治协商会议是各党派代表及无党派人士共同组织的，全中国人民当然认为合法的、民主的会议。由这会议产生的各项决议，自然也被认为合法的，而且必须遵守。所以照政协的程序做去，是唯一的合法的道路，不照这程序做去，便是违法。这是非常浅近的常识，无须多讲。便在日常生活里，少数个人之间商办一件事情，如事后一方面不照协定做去，亦大不可，何况在建国这样的大事情？既经由协商而成一种协定，便是以后一切行动的法律根据，舍此还有什么合法的路子？
    但不知道怎样一来，（表面上单见马歇尔往美国去走了一趟以后）一切变了式样，舍去政协这唯一合法、民主的路不走，却忽的一来，好象魔术登台一样，把建国大计的严肃事业，立刻变为幻弄手法的儿戏了。中国的人民当然是不肯抛弃这庄严的人民立场的，为了要求生存，要求进步，岂能看看变戏法以为满足？因此从魔术似的变化出来的一件“物事”，说它是“宪法”，人民大众是不会承认的，必然争先否认它是宪法，许多人民团体已经登报否认了。
    因为人民所要求的是实际的民主，人们要吃，要穿，要房子住，要有权讲话，自己有权选出信任的人们去做各种事情等等（这里不及细说），绝不是只要一纸空文，空头支票，或者比方墙上登着食品的广告，自己却饿倒在墙脚下，这样的生活是没有人会满足的。而且中国人民现在世故已深，经验已很丰富，不容易再上当的了。人民需要实际民主，也就是要拿到能够实行民主地生活的权柄。这事情不象美术的鉴赏，只要挂一幅画或贴上一张花纸，看看就可满足的。因此不由政协程序片面制造出来的“宪法”，大家不会承认它。即是完全跟政协宪草一样，或者比政协宪草更其民主，人民也不会承认。因为人民坚决反对由一部分人包办，代谋，而且这的确不是可由别人包办代谋的事情。
    不过有些过于“忠厚老实”的人们，头脑里还充满着拜物教思想哩。好象宪法的条文一经写成，通过后，便会发生一种力量，天然会有约束的能力似的，忘记了事情的好坏还须要有血肉的人去做才可以，空文是不发生效力的。这一些人遂以为有一部虽然不大民主，只要近乎民主的宪法，比没有总好一点。有了这一个东西，至少总可以拿来作一种依据，事实上却完全不是这么一回事。另有一些人觉得“升官发财”要紧，与人民已经脱离了，如果弄成功这样一部“宪法”，就有机会做官，或有地皮可得，那么便是拜物教的思想亦不需要了，他们是会赞成这种“宪法”的。这些人，对于民族权利怎么样？即主权送掉没有？人民权利怎么样？即人民生活得下去吗？都是不去过问的。我还要请那些希望只要有一个民主的宪法就渐能实现民主政治的人们，看看法学家张志让教授的谈话，可以得到不少的警惕。一月一日的联合晚报上有云：
    “复旦大学张志让教授说：‘这次通过的宪法与政府提出的草案，大致相同，但与政协的决议比较起来，不合之处很多，特别是关于行政院与立法院之关系，中央与地方之关系，国大问题与人民自由之限制问题，这四项尤其重要。所以要说这部宪法是根据各党派与社会贤达所主张的，事实上不是如此。’”
    张教授明白地说明了这一“宪法”，与政协的宪草“不合之处甚多”。它事实上不是根据各党派与无党派人士所商量的宪草的。有不少人，却在这样的误信。
    又最近，政治学家张奚若教授对联合晚报记者胡笛先生关于“宪法”的谈话中还有这样的一段议论：
    “这部宪法与实际政治没有多大关系，只是在现阶段国民党玩实际政治的一种把戏，上海人有一句话：是一种新枪法，是一年来公开斗争的一种新枪法，无关宏旨，这是国民党应时而生的文章与花样，在中国人的政治演变上只是一个小节，高兴看固无不可，不高兴看，也没关系。”
    如果这样的说明还不够，更可以参考一下别的事实，看看苗头，有无民主的气象呢？
    一、正在开“国大”，通过片面“宪法”的时期中，去年十二月二十三日联合晚报上说：上海市警察总局发出第一六四八三号训令，禁止约五十种杂志及书籍出售。
    二、这种“国大”闭幕后三日，即去年十二月二十八日，联合晚报上说：重庆有二十六种刊物被市府取缔、查封。
    够了，其他不必再抄录了。从这二则消息来看，如果通过“宪法”，真要实行民主，为什么一面“制宪”，一面要加强压迫言论自由，取缔刊物呢？是不是正在通过“宪法”之时，及既通过以后，必须严厉镇压言论自由的呢？是不是不这样做就不民主吗？这种不民主的情形表示实行“宪法”之时，会忽然霹雳一声，遍地民主的吗？
    没有人会相信人世间的民主政治是这样“奇迹”地出现的。
    还有，马歇尔的《离华声明》中也讲到这种“宪法”，而且说他是“民主”的。他不支持亲自参加的政协道路，却赞成违反政协道路产生的“宪法”是“民主”。他说：“国民大会业已制订一项民主之宪法，其中主要部分均与去年一月各党各派政治协商会议议决之原则相符合………”。文句是很巧妙的，令人看了不易捉摸。一则曰“主要部分”，再则曰“原则相符合”。看去好象在说很相符合，也象不大符合的。马歇尔的努力提高了中国人民的觉悟，使中国人相信过去认为他们能帮助中国政治走上民主道路是错误的。
    只要看他虽一再指摘国民党政府里的有势力的反动集团，可是事实上美国政策却始终在帮助这一种集团。而且他公然称赞通过的这件物事，说是民主的宪法，实在不解。马歇尔说他的发表这种声明里得不到什么真相，可能使真相反而模糊（他叫人把不民主不合法的“宪法”当作合法与民主来相信）。
