　　Promote Democracy by Letting the Masses Offer Opinions and Educate Village Cadres to Truly Open Up Their Minds
    Weixian Third District's Experience in Resolving Cadre-Masses Relations

    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Weixian Third District, in opening up thinking and transforming village cadres and resolving cadre-masses relations, has gained the following experiences:

    I. What ideological obstacles do old village cadres have? 1. They believe that the leadership's current mobilization of the masses is initially targeting village cadres. Their eight years of contributions during the War of Resistance should not be brought up to the masses. They should not be asked to admit their mistakes to the masses, as this would be humiliating. 2. They completely attribute their mistakes to the leadership. In villages with factions, they completely attribute the mistakes to the opposing side. 3. When the masses offer opinions, they say that the masses have prejudices, are acting from a sectarian perspective, or that the opinions are from bad people, so they cannot be reasoned with. Some are willing to humbly accept issues regarding work style that the masses bring up, but become unreasonable when economic issues are raised. Some believe that now that democracy is being promoted, the masses are the bosses, and they must admit their mistakes. Therefore, they accept them reluctantly. 4. Or they try to deal with the masses, even suppressing them.

    II. How to open up the thinking of village cadres: 1. Repeatedly discuss the spirit of the land reform and the great inspection, emphasizing that the leadership should inspect together with the masses, and everyone should be humble. 2. Combine the strength of the leadership with the strength of the masses. On the one hand, promote democracy and let the masses offer opinions; on the other hand, focus on educating village cadres. 3. Use village cadres who have already been opened up to mobilize those who have not. Commend village cadres who humbly conduct self-criticism and have gained the support of the masses.

    [Our Newspaper's Report] Qinghe Third District, in order to transform the work style of cadres, convened a district-wide village cadre introspection conference on February 11th to examine their thinking. After being enlightened, they discussed in groups, and all village cadres made profound reflections, identifying the following issues: (1) Individual instances of embezzlement of the fruits of struggle, unclear accounts, using the fruits of struggle for buying and selling, and wasting the fruits of struggle on excessive eating and drinking. (2) Pushing work and not doing labor, assigning labor and porters for tasks at their own homes. (3) Individual instances of being tricked by landlords, accepting invitations and gifts, and providing cover for landlords. (4) Old village cadres believe they made contributions during the War of Resistance, look down on other cadres, the masses, and new activists, and believe that the masses' liberation is their own achievement, failing to see the strength of the masses. (5) A small number of cadres perfunctorily deal with higher authorities. After this review and reflection, the cadres felt as if a major illness had been cured. They are now enthusiastically discussing how to transform themselves and serve the masses.

　　发扬民主让群众提意见教育村干真正打通思想
    威县三区解决干群关系经验
    【本报讯】威县三区打通思想改造村干部，解决干群关系上获得如下几点经验：
    一、老村干部有那些思想障碍？１、认为领导上这次发动群众头一炮先斗村干，抗战八年有功不能向群众提，单叫向群众承认错误，丢人。２、把自己的错误完全推到领导上，有派别的村，把错误完全推到对方。３、群众给提出意见来，就说群众有成见，宗派出发，或说是坏人提出的，我打不通。也有的群众给提出关于作风上的问题，肯虚心接受，但提到经济上的问题就又不通了。有认为兴了民主，群众是大爷，不承认错误也不行，于是勉强接受。４、或设法对付群众，甚至镇压群众。
    二、如何打通村干思想：１、反复谈解翻身大检查的精神，领导上与群众一块检查，大家都要虚心。２、领导力量与群众力量结合。一方面发扬民主让群众提意见，另一方面抓紧对村干教育。３、通过先打通的村干去动员打不通的村干。对虚心自我检讨，而又得到了群众拥护的村干加以表扬。
    【本报讯】清河三区为转变干部作风，于二月十一日召开全区村干反省大会检查思想。经启发后分组讨论，各村干都作了深刻反省，检查出以下几种问题：（一）个别贪污斗争果实账目不清，借用果实作买卖，浪费果实大吃大喝。（二）推工作忙不干活，自己家里的活派差派夫。（三）个别上了地主圈套，吃请受礼，给地主打掩护。（四）老村干部自认抗战有功，看不起其他干部、群众和新积极分子，认为群众翻身是自己的功劳，看不见群众力量。（五）少数干部马马虎虎应付上级。干部经这次检讨反省，心里像去了一大场病，现正热烈讨论如何转变，为群众服务。
