[Report from this newspaper's front in the Jilu Yu Region on the 13th] Chen Cheng's "Observations on 'Suppressing Bandits' in the Taixian, Jiangyan, and Qutang Areas of Northern Jiangsu" has been captured by the People's Liberation Army on the Jilu Yu front. This document was copied and distributed to his subordinates by Zhao Yanxing, the magistrate of the Chiang-controlled Jinxiang County. Regarding military affairs, the "Observations" admit that "the Nationalist army is everywhere on the defensive," "there is a lack of confidence among all levels," "a lack of combat experience," and "combat effectiveness has been greatly reduced, and repeated equipment changes cannot compensate for the above losses." "The Nationalist army can only occupy points and lines, making it difficult to supply materials, depleting troop sources, and making it impossible to replenish after casualties." Regarding politics, Chen Cheng confesses to the crimes of the Nationalist army and the Three People's Principles Youth League "Homecoming Legions," stating: "There are many groups following our army's advance, such as the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Homecoming Legions, in various forms, mostly local despots by nature, accustomed to filth, and with too many monks and too little gruel, they engage in corruption under various guises, creating hatred among the people, causing the people to turn their backs on us." It also says: "The bandit army (referring to the People's Liberation Army, same below) does indeed achieve cooperation between the army and the people, but we may not. We have not reasonably handled the land distributed by the bandits after recovering it, causing the peasants to tend towards the bandits." Regarding the economy, it is even more frankly admitted: "The bandit area is effectively controlled, but after we recover it, we adopt a plundering policy, prices soar, causing public unrest and complaints."

　　陈诚自供内战败绩
    并对蒋军罪恶直认不讳
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】陈诚“参加苏北泰县姜堰曲塘地区之《剿匪》观感”一件，已为冀鲁豫前线人民解放军战斗中缴获。该件系蒋记金乡县县长赵彦兴抄发其属下者。关于军事，该“观感”自认“国军处处被动”，“各级互无信心”，“缺乏战斗经验”，“战斗力大减，虽屡换装备亦无补上项损失。”“国军仅能点线占领，物资接济困难，兵源枯竭，伤亡之后，无法补充。”关于政治，陈诚自供蒋军及三青团“还乡团”等的罪恶称：“我随军推进团体众多，如三青团、还乡队，形形色色，多为地道土豪，食污成性，且僧多粥少，假冒各类方式贪污，造成民众仇恨心理，使民心背我。”又谓：“匪军（指人民解放军，下同）确实作到军民合作，但我则未必。经匪分配之土地，收复后我无合理处置，使农民趋向于匪。”关于经济，更直认不讳：“匪区管制得法，我收复后则取掠夺政策，物价暴涨，引起民众生活不安，而有所怨言。”
