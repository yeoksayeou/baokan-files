Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th -- Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense spokesperson made a shamelessly outrageous statement on the 25th. The following day (26th), Peng Xuepei made an absurd and preposterous response to reporters' questions. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on this, saying:

　　The Chiang Kai-shek clique, from the head to the lackeys, all employ gangster tactics. The news they have always denied is precisely what exists in fact or is becoming a fact. What they say they will do is precisely what they are unwilling to do and will never do; and what they say they will not do is precisely what they intend to do and have already done. In a word, turning black into white and white into black is the propaganda rule of Chiang Kai-shek and his gang. As is well known, Chiang Kai-shek categorically denied last year that there would be an economic panic in the Chiang-controlled areas, but this year a major panic has arrived. It is clearly himself who caused the economic panic, but he wants to shift the responsibility onto the CCP. He is full of "benevolence, righteousness, and morality," and "new life," but the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families are dens of male thieves and female prostitutes, corrupt officials, and bandits. He claims to be orthodox and should pass it on to his descendants for generations, but the fair-minded American people say he is a "monster" and a "parasite driving the country towards a suicide system" (New York Afternoon Journal, February 19th). This time in the Lu'nan campaign, Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda machine had already boasted that "Chen Yi's troops were annihilated by sixteen brigades and seven columns," but it was Chiang's seven reorganized divisions that were annihilated, and Li Xianzhou was captured alive. Therefore, Peng Xuepei's denial that the Jinan campaign was a great victory is precisely because the Lu'nan campaign was indeed a great defeat. The Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of National Defense spokesperson's "denial" of launching an offensive against Yan'an is just like the chief liar Chiang Kai-shek pretending to invite the CCP to participate in "reorganizing the government" while issuing the December 30th secret order, which is to say that an offensive was indeed launched against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Look at the facts, about a week before Li Xianzhou was captured, Hu Zongnan dispatched seven brigades and thirteen regiments to attack the Guanzhong Sub-region of the Border Region, occupying Malan; he also transferred the main force of the Reorganized First Division from southern Shanxi to cross the Yellow River to the west. As for what the Ministry of National Defense spokesperson nonsensically said, "the fighting in that area has come to an end," it precisely shows that Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are plotting how to reorganize, vainly trying to conceal their humiliating and foolish attempt to invade Yan'an. Whether their wishful thinking can be realized remains to be seen; Li Xianzhou is a lesson from the past. The areas occupied by the Chiang army under any base excuse will certainly be recovered by the people of the liberated areas. This is by no means something that can be settled with two sentences of a nonsensical "came to an end." The Ministry of National Defense spokesperson also fabricated "drug trafficking in Guanzhong," which is precisely the Chiang Kai-shek, who came from the Qinghong gang as a small apprentice living by drug trafficking, is used to reversing black and white, a gangster tactic, which is known to all and not worth laughing at!

### 蒋家喽罗无耻撒谎  新华社记者痛加驳斥

　　蒋家喽罗无耻撒谎
    新华社记者痛加驳斥
    【新华社延安二十七日电】蒋记国防部发言人二十五日发表了无耻透顶的谈话，翌日（二十六日）彭学沛又发表了荒谬绝伦的答记者问，新华社记者对此加以评论称：
    蒋记班子由头目到喽罗，俱是一派流氓手法，他们历来否认的消息，正就是事实上存在或正在成为事实的；他们说要做的，恰正是他们所决不愿做和决不会做的；而他们说不做的，恰正是他们所要做的和已经做了的。一句话，黑的变成白的，白的变成黑的，就是蒋介石一伙的宣传规律。如所周知，蒋介石去年矢口否认蒋管区会有经济恐慌，今年就来了大恐慌。明明是自己造成了经济恐慌，却要把责任推到中共身上。他满口“仁义道德”“新生活”，蒋宋孔陈四大家族就是男盗女娼的贪官污吏贼窝子。他自称为是正统，应该传之子孙万世，但公正的美国人民就说他是个“怪物”，是“驱使全国走向自杀制度的寄生虫”（二月十九日纽约下午报）。这回鲁南会战，蒋家宣传班子早就大吹大擂说：“陈毅部队被歼十六个旅七个纵队”，而这回被歼的正是蒋记的七个整师，李仙洲被生擒活捉。所以，彭学沛出来否认济南会战打了大胜仗，正是鲁南实在打了大败仗。蒋记国防部发言人“否认”向延安发动攻势，就是如撒谎头子蒋介石一面装出邀请中共参加“改组政府”，一面颁发十二月三十日密令一样，就是向陕甘宁边区实在发动了攻势。请看事实，当李仙洲下马就擒前约一星期，胡宗南就出动了七个旅十三个团兵力进攻边区的关中分区，侵占了马栏；还由晋南抽调主力整编第一师等西渡黄河。至于该国防部发言人胡说什么“该方战事已告一段落”，正说明蒋记强盗正在盘算如何重新布置，妄想掩盖其窜犯延安的蠢动自惭，他们的如意算盘能否如愿以偿，李仙洲就是前车之鉴。蒋军在任何卑污借口下侵占的地区，解放区人民誓必收回，这绝非两句“告一段落”的荒唐文章所能了事。该国防部发言人又胡诌什么“关中贩毒”云云，这正是以贩毒为生的青红帮小徒弟出身的蒋介石颠倒黑白的惯技，流氓手法，路人皆知，不值一笑！
