Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. According to a report in the Shanghai News on January 17th, American forces are actively invading Northwest China. The report stated: The United States is paying close attention to Tibet, a strategically important continental base. It has long used the excuse of finding a transport route from India to China to send two members of the Strategic Intelligence Bureau to Tibet. Now, it has further decided to send a "goodwill visiting group" to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, this year to establish "diplomatic relations" with Tibet. In contrast, Britain recently attempted to use the bait of sponsoring Tibet's request for "independence" from China to obtain the establishment of several military bases in Tibet, but failed. The newspaper also revealed on January 20th that the Chiang government, with American support, is undertaking the large-scale construction of a route running through the Northwest. The author of the article pointed out: "The government's (referring to the Chiang government) road construction plan has always been just a paper exercise. This time, after the prompting of powerful figures, it is still implementing the plan bit by bit despite all the difficulties." The article explained that the route is based on the Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway, and goes north along the Dianqing and Qingxin highways to Xinjiang, and south connects with the Chengtian Road, Sichuan-Yunnan Road, Yunnan-Burma Road, and Haicheng-Xin Highway, with a total length of more than 1,700 kilometers, of which one-third has now been completed. The Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the railway, with a total length of more than 370 kilometers, has completed one-sixth of its roadbed. The Chengdu-Tianshui Road, which is connected to the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, started construction last autumn. The Diankang Railway, which connects the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam roads in the south and the Chengtian and Chengyu roads in the north, sent a survey team in May last year and spent four months surveying the route from Kunming via Xichang to Chengdu. This project has been included in the Chiang government's so-called "Five-Year National Defense Plan" and is being accelerated. In addition, the Pingliang-Ningxia Highway from Pingliang, Gansu, to Ningxia is also being actively rebuilt. The 700-mile highway from Dunhuang, out of Yumenguan, to Qiang has been opened to traffic last year. The article finally sharply criticized the Chiang government for allowing the United States to use this major artery running through western China to achieve its political and military goals, saying: "We should not use our lives and property to gamble for others. We hope that the railway will bring us peace, democracy, and prosperity, not criminals. If some people cruelly intend to take the destiny of the country and the nation and hang it on the tails of ambitious people, it will definitely not be allowed by the people of the whole country."

　　美国魔手侵入大西北
    蒋介石开门揖盗大事修路
    【新华社延安四日电】据一月十七日沪报载文披露，美国势力正积极侵入中国大西北。该报称：美国对西藏这一块有重大意义的大陆基地甚为注意，早就借口找寻由印入华运输线，派有战略情报局局员二人驻在西藏，现在又进一步定于今年派遣“亲善访问团”赴西藏首府拉萨，以便同西藏建立“外交关系”；与此相对抗的，是不久以前英国企图以赞助西藏向中国要求“独立”为钓饵，求得在西藏建立若干军事基地，但未获成功。该报一月廿日又揭露蒋政府正在美国支持下大修纵贯西北之路线，该文作者指出：“从来政府（指蒋政府）筑路计划，总不过是纸面具文，这次经过有力者的提示，乃在万分困难中仍然一点一滴地将计划付诸实现。”该文说明该路线系以陇海路天兰段为基干，北循甸青、青新两公路去新疆，南接成天路、川滇路、滇缅路、海成新公路，全长一千七百余公里，现已完成三分之一。天（水）兰（州）段铁路全长三百七十余公里，路基已完成六分之一，与天兰铁路相衔接的成（都）天（水）路去秋已开工兴筑，南接滇缅、滇越两路，北接成天、成渝两路的滇康铁路，去年五月派出测量队，以四个月的时间测完了昆明经西昌到成都的路线。此项工程已列入蒋政府所谓“五年国防计划”中，正加紧兴建中。此外，从甘肃平凉到宁夏的平宁公路亦在积极重修，炖煌出玉门关到羌的公路七百余里已于去年通车。该文最后对蒋政府以此一纵贯中国西部之大动脉，让美国利用以达其政治军事目的尖锐抨击称：“我们不应拿自己的生命财产去供别人赌博，希望铁路给我们带来和平民主和富强，而不是罪徒，如果某些人竟狠心地打算连国家民族的命运一起拿去挂在野心者的尾巴上，那一定不为全国人民所允许。”
