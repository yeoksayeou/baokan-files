Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Yan'an held a mobilization rally yesterday (the 8th) at 4:00 PM in the Chamber of Commerce assembly hall to defend the border region and Yan'an. Besides personnel from government offices and schools, what was especially striking was the thousands of farmers and their militia self-defense forces who had rushed in from the four rural districts within forty to fifty *li* of Yan'an, as well as the CCP liaison personnel who had just been forced to withdraw from the KMT-controlled areas the day before, totaling over ten thousand people, crowding the entire venue, the hillsides next to it, and the main road in front. Red-tasseled spears, rifles, and millions of arms demonstrated the great, unassailable strength of the army and people of Yan'an.

"Resolutely defend the border region, defend Yan'an, defend the land, defend democracy, defend a life of plenty, and defend Chairman Mao!" "The entire army and people of the border region must urgently mobilize, smash the offensive of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and drive out the fascist bandit Hu Zongnan!" These two large banners posted on either side of the venue were the calls to arms of the border region's army and people in their self-defense, reflecting the strong will of the people of Yan'an to prepare for war in recent days.

The rally began amidst the sounds of battle horns. After electing Chairman Lin Boqu, Vice-Chairman Li Dingming, Vice-Chairman Liu Jingfan, Vice-Speaker Xie Juezai, Vice-Commander Wang Weizhou, Deng Yingchao, Xi Zhongxun, Mayor Xie Huaide, Bai Qian, Chairman Wang Kewen, Yang Buhao, and ten others to the presidium, Chairman Lin delivered the opening remarks. After pointing out the situation of the Chiang-Hu armies' continuous attacks on the border region after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, he called out: "The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is the birthplace of democracy, the location of the CCP Central Committee, has cultivated revolutionary cadres, and has done many things to liberate the people and make China democratic, peaceful, and independent. We must do everything in our power to defend the border region, defend Yan'an, defend Chairman Mao, and defend Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" He demanded, "Everyone must unite, learn from past experience, establish organizations such as militia guerrillas, cooperate with the regular army in combat, and drive out Hu Zongnan! Commanders and fighters, militiamen, guerrillas, all the people must organize to smash the offensive of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" (The masses shouted: Defend Yan'an! Defend Chairman Mao! Defend Commander-in-Chief Zhu!) Subsequently, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, and Comrade Zhou Enlai spoke in succession (the original text will be detailed separately). Comrade Deng Yingchao, representing the women's community, said: "We will definitely win this battle, just like in the middle of the Anti-Japanese War, right?" (The masses said: "Right!") "Clear the fields, don't give the enemy a single grain of food, don't let them live here, don't let them survive! The 70 million women in the liberated areas won't fall behind, right?" (The women present said: "Right!") "We will definitely keep up! (Everyone said in unison: "We can keep up!") Men go to the front lines, women make shoes, make clothes, carry out land reform, and produce, we will definitely win the battle! Various worker, youth, and other organizations must become participating organizations, cooperate in combat, and we can definitely win the battle! The Chinese people will definitely win!" (Everyone shouted: The Chinese people will definitely win!) Then, Chairman Wang Kewen gave a speech on behalf of the business community, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek tore up the agreements and attacked the liberated areas, and also attacked Yan'an. The workers, peasants, and businessmen of Yan'an must unite, join the self-defense forces, and form stretcher transport teams to repel the enemy. We have the strength! Resolutely defend the border region, defend Yan'an, defend Chairman Mao, defend Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" After the speech, the rally passed a telegram (see today's newspaper, second page, for details), shouted slogans, and adjourned.

    【新华社延安九日电】延安各界保卫边区、保卫延安的动员大会，于昨日（八日）下午四时在商会大会场举行。到会的群众，除了机关、学校的人员外，特别引人注目的是延安四五十里内四乡赶来的数千农民和他们的民兵自卫军，还有前日刚从蒋管区被迫撤回的中共联络人员，共约万余人，把整个的会场旁边的山坡以及门口的大路都挤满了。红缨枪、步枪和千万只臂膀，表现出延安军民不可侮的伟大力量。
