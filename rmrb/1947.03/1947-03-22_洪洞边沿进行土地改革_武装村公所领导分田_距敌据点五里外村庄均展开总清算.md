    Land Reform Carried Out on the Edge of Hongdong
    Armed Village Governments Lead Land Distribution
    General Liquidation Unfolded in Villages Within Five Li of Enemy Strongholds
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] Armed village governments in the border areas of Hongdong County are leading peasants in launching a land reform movement. In the entire county, 31 out of 132 villages have already initiated struggle, and the villages of Shangzhai and Quanzi Zhang have preliminarily realized "land to the tiller." The Second District, where mobilization is best, has initiated struggle in 20 out of 32 villages, and the remaining villages are also brewing. In addition to leading and mobilizing the masses, the armed village governments, in conjunction with the militia home guard, are besieging the enemy day and night on the front lines, preventing the enemy from venturing out, greatly increasing the masses' confidence in the victory of the struggle. Villages within five li of the enemy's Subao stronghold have become safe areas, and the masses are settling down to liquidate the landlords. Quanzi Zhang (ten li from Subao), after a half-month of vigorous movement, has completed filling in the gaps and making up the differences, and all landlords and poor peasants in the village have been eliminated. Summarizing the situation in various villages, the struggle is currently being carried out in three types of villages. The first type is represented by Baishuzhuang, which had previously undergone struggle, but it was all superficial, and the feudal forces still retained a lot of land; only two of the village's nine landlords and feudal rich peasants had been liquidated. At the beginning of this movement, a general liquidation approach was adopted, mobilizing the masses to carry out a major struggle, and the peasants obtained land in a very short time. The second type is represented by Beiguadi, where land is scattered. After years of rent reduction and interest reduction and last year's major anti-traitor struggle, the feudal rule has been crushed, and the feudal elements of the rich peasants have also been largely eliminated. Currently, investigation and cleaning up and distribution of fruits are being carried out to fill in the gaps. The third type is represented by Village ××, which is only five li from the enemy, and the masses have been transferred and dispersed to other villages. Although the masses have enemy concerns, they have no "change of dynasty" thinking after a long period of training, and urgently demand the distribution of land. The armed village government of this village is organizing groups in various villages to brew the struggle.

    洪洞边沿进行土地改革
    武装村公所领导分田
    距敌据点五里外村庄均展开总清算
    【本报太岳二十日电】洪洞边沿区武装村公所领导农民展开土地改革运动，全县一百三十二个村已有三十一个村掀起斗争，上寨、泉子掌两村已初步实现耕者有其田。发动最好的二区，三十二区村中已有二十个村展开斗争，其余各村也正在酝酿。武装村公所除领导发动群众外，并结合民兵保家队日夜在前线围困敌人，使敌人不敢出扰，大大的增加了群众斗争胜利信心。距敌苏堡据点五里以外的村庄已成安全地区，群众安心与地主进行清算。泉子掌（距苏堡十里）经半个月轰轰烈烈的运动，已完成填平补齐，全村地主与贫农全部消灭。综合各村情况，目前正以三种类型村开展斗争。第一种以柏树庄为代表，过去曾经过斗争，但皆是水过地皮湿，封建势力仍保有很多土地，全村九户地主与封建富农，仅清算过两户。此次运动一开始即采取总清算的方式，发动群众进行大斗争，经过很短时间，农民便获得了土地。第二种以北卦底为代表，该村土地分散，经过历年的减租减息与去年的大反奸斗争，封建统治已被摧垮，富农的封建部分亦大部消灭。现正调查与清理分配果实，进行填补。第三种以××村为代表，该村距敌仅五里，群众已转移分散到其他村中。群众虽有敌情顾虑，但久经锻炼，却无“变天”思想，迫切要求分配土地，该村武装村公所正分头到各村组织小组，酝酿斗争。
