    Klement Gottwald, Leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party

    Klement Gottwald is the chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. On July 3, 1946, when the new Czechoslovak government was formed, Gottwald became the Prime Minister. This biography was originally published in "Czech Democracy" and is now selected for publication here, which will help us understand the development of the world's new democracy. We also plan to continue collecting biographies of leading comrades of communist parties and people's heroes from various countries and continue to publish them.

    The results of the election prove that Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, has been entrusted to organize a new government that conforms to the will of the people. Undoubtedly, Comrade Gottwald is already an outstanding figure in the history of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. His name is closely linked to the establishment of the powerful Czechoslovak Communist Party, to the struggle of the Czech and Slavic peoples against Hitler's fascism, and to the construction of a democratic people's republic.

    Gottwald was born on November 23, 1896, into a peasant family in Dědice, Moravia. He spent his childhood in the Moravian countryside. At the age of twelve, he went to Vienna to start an apprenticeship as a carpenter. In the anti-Czech atmosphere that prevailed in Vienna at the time, he experienced the national oppression of the Czech people for the first time. While working as an apprentice, he attended school, and after school, he worked for his master until 8 or 10 p.m., and two days a week he had to work until 2 a.m. In 1912, he joined the Czech Social Democratic Youth Organization and a workers' sports group, and began studying socialist literature. In 1914, the Great War broke out, and Gottwald returned to Moravia to work as a carpenter, but after only a year he was drafted into the Austrian army, where he suffered all kinds of abuse. In the autumn of 1915, he was sent to the Eastern Front, and later he deserted from the army, ending his career in the Austrian army. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed and the Czechoslovak Republic was established, he was in the new Czech army. After retiring from the army, he began working in a factory and became a workers' representative and the secretary of the local left-wing Social Democratic Party organization.

    After the establishment of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Gottwald quickly became one of the active members of the Bolshevik core of the party. From 1921, he abandoned his profession and devoted himself to working for the party. He ran a Slavic newspaper, during which time he thoroughly familiarized himself with the various issues of the Slavic nations. In 1924, he became the editor of Slavic Truth. Gottwald became the central figure of the left wing of the party, which was working to expel elements hostile to the working class from the party, thus abandoning the legacy of opportunism and reformism.

    Gottwald was a staunch fighter for these principles. At the Third National Congress of the party in 1925, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee. In 1926, he went to Prague to be responsible for the party's Central Propaganda Department, fighting for the party's policy of true Marxist-Leninism, and finally won at the Fifth Czechoslovak Communist Party National Congress. At that meeting, hostile elements and opportunists were excluded, and Comrade Gottwald was unanimously elected as the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. It can be said that from the time Gottwald became the leader of the Bolshevik faction, most of his life history has been the history of the party.

    The ensuing years of world economic crisis, unemployment, and the declining living standards of the working people, in Gottwald's report to the party's Sixth Congress, predicted the further increase in the severity of the crisis; and stipulated the task of uniting all working people, regardless of political beliefs, to fight for work and bread, and to resist the attack of capitalism. The crisis of fascism became increasingly prominent in Germany, and the reactionary forces in Czechoslovakia also imitated these fascists, suppressing the workers' movement. Gottwald was responsible for formulating the strategy of the anti-fascist united front and defending democratic rights. He wrote: "We believe that the bloody fascist reactionary wave is trying to engulf the whole of Central Europe, bringing endless suffering to all working people. The working class must first seek a common language at this time, and must act in unison."

    In 1935, the Seventh Congress of the Communist International was held in Moscow. Gottwald and Georgi Dimitrov played a prominent role in formulating the principles of the people's front and the national front, and these principles later became the basis for concentrating democratic forces against fascism. He also emphasized the need to establish a people's front government in Czechoslovakia. These issues were further developed at the Seventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1936. At that meeting, Gottwald answered the question that everyone cared about: Is it possible to defend the republic against fascist aggressors? "It is possible," he said, "as long as the division within the working class is overcome, and a united front of workers' parties and organizations is established." However, his warnings did not receive enough attention from other socialists and democratic parties.

    Later, the republic was betrayed. At the meeting of the party's leading comrades in November 1938, Gottwald stipulated a new task: to immediately prepare for secret work and transfer all party organizations to underground activities. The struggle continued, and at the end of November, the party's Central Committee decided that Gottwald and several other leading comrades should go to Moscow in order to guide the future struggle there. In one of his articles (published in Paris), he laid the foundation for the party's policy during the entire occupation, and in fact these policies later became the goal of the entire Czech resistance movement.

    In July 1941, the Soviet-Czech treaty was concluded. As the person in charge of Czech exiles in Moscow, Gottwald's responsibility became even greater. He led this group in Moscow, directed the Czech Communist Party in England, and even participated in the work of the party in the country. In 1943, in the Czechoslovak publication in Moscow, he specifically discussed the issue of establishing the future liberated republic on the basis of the new democratic people's masses. During President Beneš's visit to Moscow, he discussed the issue of the resistance movement with the President and suggested to the President the main points and content of what later became the Košice government program.

    On April 4, 1945, the President of the Czechoslovak Republic appointed the first government of the liberated republic in Košice, and Comrade Gottwald was appointed as the first Deputy Prime Minister. Prior to this, the Communists had been participating in the activities of the government. The development of events proved the correctness of the Communist Party's policy. The Czech working people warmly welcomed Gottwald and other party comrades to lead the country, and from the establishment of this new liberated republic, it was emphasized that all efforts must be made to rebuild the destroyed economy and establish a truly democratic system for the people's masses.

    His ability as a statesman is due to his constant contact with the working people from all walks of life, listening to their opinions, and mastering the party's policies in cooperation with them. It is in this spirit that he leads the entire Communist Party.

    捷共领袖哥特瓦德
    克里曼·哥特瓦德是捷克共产党主席，一九四六年七月三日捷克新政府成立，哥特瓦德就任总理，这篇传记原载“捷克民主”，现选载于此，对我们了解世界新民主主义的发展会有帮助。今后并打算继续搜集各国共产党领导同志及人民英雄传记，继续发表。
                ——编者
    选举的结果，证明捷克共产党主席克里曼·哥特瓦德已经被委托组织一个符合人民意志的新政府，无疑问地，哥特瓦德同志已经是捷共历史上的出色人物了，他的名字是与强大的捷克共产党的建立，与捷克族与斯拉夫族反希特拉法西斯主义的斗争，以及与民主的人民共和国的建造紧紧联系着的。
    哥特瓦德一八九六年十一月二十三日，生于摩拉维亚、台第司的一个农家里，他的幼年时期就是在摩拉维亚乡村里度过的，十二岁时去维也纳，开始在一个木工手下做学徒，在当时维也纳正盛行的反捷克的气焰下，他第一次体会了捷克族的民族压迫。他一面做学徒，一面进学校求学，散学后为他主人工作到晚上八点钟或者十点钟，每周还有两天要工作到清晨两点钟。一九一二年他参加捷克社会民主青年组织与一个工人体育团体，开始攻读社会主义文学。一九一四年大战爆发，哥特瓦德返回摩拉维亚干木工，但仅仅一年就被征入奥地利军队，在那里，他经受了各种各样的虐待。一九一五年秋天开赴东线，以后他从部队逃跑出来，终止了他在奥地利军队的生涯。奥匈帝国覆灭，捷克共和国建立时，他在新捷克军队里。退役后，他开始在一个工厂作工，成为工人代表与当地左翼社会民主党组织的书记。
    在捷克共产党建立以后，哥特瓦德很快就成为那些党的布尔塞维克核心的积极分子之一。一九二一年起他抛弃职业，全力为党工作。他主办一家斯拉夫报纸，在这期间，他透彻地熟悉了斯拉夫民族的各项问题。一九二四年，任斯拉夫真理报编辑，哥特瓦德成了党内左翼的中心人物，那时候，党的左翼正在努力从党内驱除敌视工人阶级的分子，因此得以抛弃了机会主义和改良主义的遗产。
    哥特瓦德是为这些原则而斗争的坚强战士，于一九二五年党的第三次全国代表大会上，当选为中央委员。一九二六年他赴布拉格负责党的中央宣传部工作，为革命的真正马列主义党的政策而斗争，终于在第五次捷共全国代表大会上胜利了。在那一次会上，敌视分子和机会主义者被排除，全体一致选举哥特瓦德同志为捷共总书记。可以说，从哥特瓦德成为布尔塞维克派领袖起，他的生活史的大部分就是党的历史。
    接踵而至的世界经济危机、失业和劳动人民生活水准遭受打击的年份，在哥特瓦德向党的第六次代表大会所作的报告里，预言了该危机严重性的进一步增涨；并规定了不分政治信仰团结一切劳动人民的任务，来为工作和面包而斗争，并抵抗资本主义的进攻。法西斯主义的危机在德国越来越显著了，捷克国内的反动势力也模仿这些法西斯主义者，镇压工人阶级的运动。哥特瓦德负责制定反法西斯统一战线及保卫民主权利的策略，他写道：“我们认为，血腥的法西斯的反动浪潮正想淹没整个中欧，给一切劳动人民带来无尽止的痛苦。工人阶级这个时候必须首先觅取共同的语言，而且必须一致行动。”
    一九三五年共产国际第七次代表大会举行于莫斯科，哥特瓦德与乔治·季米特洛夫在制定人民阵线和民族阵线的原则上起了突出的作用，而这些原则在以后成了集中民主力量反对法西斯主义的基础。他还强调必须在捷克成立人民阵线的政府，这些问题在一九三六年召开的捷共第七次代表大会上得到了进一步的发展。在那次会上哥特瓦德回答了每个人所关心的问题：保卫共和国反对法西斯侵略者有无可能？“可能的”，他说：“只要克服了工人阶级内部的分裂，并建立起工人阶级各党及各团体的统一战线就可能了。”然而，他的警告并没有得到其他社会主义者及民主党派足够的注意。
    后来，共和国被出卖了，在一九三八年十一月的党的领导同志的会议上，哥特瓦德规定了新的任务：立刻准备秘密工作，将一切党的组织转入地下活动。战斗继续着，到十一月末党的中央决定哥特瓦德与其他几个领导同志到莫斯科去，以便在那里指导未来的斗争。在他的一篇文章（该文在巴黎发表）里，奠定了党在整个占领期间政策的方针，事实上这些方针以后成了整个捷克抵抗运动的目标。
    一九四一年七月，苏捷条约缔结。哥特瓦德作为在莫斯科捷克流亡者的负责人，责任更重大了。他领导在莫斯科的这个集团，指导在英国的捷克共产党，甚至还参与国内党的工作。一九四三年在莫斯科的捷克斯拉夫刊物上，他具体地论述了在新民主主义人民大众的基础上建立未来解放共和国的问题。贝奈斯总统访莫斯科期间，他和总统讨论了抵抗运动的问题，并且向总统建议了那些后来成为科息斯政府纲领的主要点与内容。
    一九四五年四月四日，捷克共和国总统在科息斯任命了解放后共和国的首届政府，哥特瓦德同志被任为首届副总理。在此以前，共产党人就一直参与了该政府的活动，事情的发展证明了共产党政策的正确，捷克劳动人民热烈的欢迎哥特瓦德以及其他党的同志领导全国，从这个新的解放共和国建立起，也就强调必须竭尽全力重建被破坏的经济与建立真正人民大众的民主制度。
    他的政治家的能力，是由于他经常联系着各界劳动人民，听取他们的意见，而且在与他们的合作中掌握党的政策，他是在这种精神下领导整个共产党的。
