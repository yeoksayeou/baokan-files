    Fifth-Fourth Unit Puts Out Fire
    Brigade Political Department Commends and Awards Meritorious Service
    [Reported from Taihang on the 22nd of this month] Our Fifth-Fourth Unit, while moving from a certain location to a village in Anyang on the 1st of this month, had just arrived at the encampment when a girl rushed over from Village ××, urgently pleading, "Quick, come and help us put out the fire!" It turned out that the girl was cooking when sparks from the chimney fell into the straw stack behind the house. That day, a strong wind was blowing, and the wind fueled the flames, making them difficult to control. Furthermore, most of the men in the entire village (nineteen households) had gone to the market, leaving mostly elderly people, women, and children behind, who were helpless. Our Sixth Company, disregarding the fatigue of the march, dispatched Platoon Leader Zhang Leyi with a platoon to rush to the rescue. When the troops arrived at the village, the fire was spreading with the wind, and the house of Liu Dahai next door was already on fire. More than ten houses in a row were in imminent danger. Our soldiers quickly formed a human ladder and charged towards the raging fire. They first knocked down the burning main beam of Liu Dahai's house, then immediately poured water and covered it with soil. Platoon Leader Zhang Leyi even risked his life by jumping into the fire pit to rescue important materials and farm tools, only running out when his cotton uniform caught fire. After the fire was extinguished, most of the comrades were soaked in mud and water from the waist down. The old men and women of the entire village gratefully said, "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, the entire village would have been burned down by the time the people returned from the market." The masses expressed endless gratitude, and the Brigade Political Commissar also issued a circular of commendation to the unit, and recorded a meritorious service.

    五四部队救火
    旅政通报表扬记功
    【本报太行廿二日电】我五四部队于本月一日由某地移防安阳某村时，部队刚到宿营地，忽由××庄方面跑来一女孩，急求部队：“快去给俺救救火！”原来女孩做饭时，烟囱火星落入房后草垛，是日适刮大风，风助火烈，势难招架，同时全村（十九户）男人大部又外出赶集，留村人几尽为老幼妇女，束手无策。我六连当不顾行军累倦，派张乐义排长带一排人奔赴急救。部队跑步至该村时，火头正随风伸展，隔壁刘大孩之房已着火，接连着的十余家房舍，危在眉睫。我战士迅即搭起人梯冲向正炽之大火，首将刘大孩房已着之大梁打落，随即泼水盖土，张乐义排长并舍身跳入火坑抢出重要物资及农具，直到他的棉衣着火始跑出。救毕火，大部同志下身几全被泥水湿透。全村老汉老婆们感激的说：“要不是八路军，等赶集人们回来，全村就烧光啦。”群众说不尽的感激，旅政委对该部亦通报表扬，并记功一次。
