    Book Publications Double
    In the new five-year plan for Soviet national economic development, preparations are being made to greatly expand the printing industry. The Soviet State Publishing Company Association will greatly increase the publication of novels, scientific, technical, and agricultural works. Plans for the construction of new printing companies have already been drafted. The printing company to be established in Ulan-Ude will publish 75 million books annually, an output equal to the total number of books published by all publishing companies that joined the association in 1946. The number of books to be published in 1947 will be double that of 1946.
    Large Number of Soviet Works Published in Europe and America
    According to a report by Alexander, Deputy Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Soviet Writers' Union, in the past five years, a total of 1,200 Soviet literary works have been published in Europe and America. The number of Soviet works published in Britain in 1945 was almost equal to the total number of Soviet works published in Britain in the past twenty years. Simonov's "Days and Nights," depicting the Battle of Stalingrad, sold 500,000 copies in the United States.
