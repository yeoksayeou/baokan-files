Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 27th: The sudden withdrawal of UNRRA personnel stationed in Yantai on the 10th, and the cessation of Deputy Director-General of UNRRA, Mr. Jackson's planned inspection of Yantai, has aroused speculation from all walks of life here. A reporter recently interviewed the spokesman of the Shandong Liberated Area Relief Committee to inquire about the details and reasons for the event. The spokesman provided the following statement: On the 10th of this month, Dr. Baker, a medical roving officer of UNRRA stationed in Shandong, and Mr. Tang Fude, the director of agricultural rehabilitation in the Shandong region, suddenly received a telegram from Dr. Qi, the director of the UNRRA Qingdao office, relayed by the captain of the "Wan Jing" ship, stating that due to the military situation, they should quickly leave Yantai and temporarily retreat to Shanghai. At that time, Dr. Baker and others telegraphed requesting a delay, but it was not approved. Our side, not having received a formal notice from UNRRA regarding the withdrawal of personnel, was quite concerned about their safety when leaving the area. The UNRRA Yantai office had also not received such notification and telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters for clarification, but no reply was received. Because Dr. Baker and others were repeatedly urged by telegram from Qingdao, they returned to Shanghai on the "Wan Jing" ship on the afternoon of the 12th. Because our side had the UNRRA Yantai office responsible for the safety of these three gentlemen, and although no formal documents were received, a farewell banquet was held, and the matter was reported to Mr. Dong Biwu, chairman of the Liberated Area Relief Committee in Shanghai. According to the UNRRA personnel stationed in Yantai, the Shanghai headquarters telegraphed stating: "The withdrawal of UNRRA personnel stationed in Yantai has nothing to do with Shanghai." Based on the above situation, this action was clearly planned by the Qingdao side, and its intention is quite puzzling. The spokesman continued: International relief efforts must not be abandoned because of the military actions of the Chiang Kai-shek troops attacking the liberated areas. This time, the arbitrary withdrawal of UNRRA personnel stationed in Yantai and the suspension of relief supplies to the liberated areas under the pretext of destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek troops do not conform to the principles of morality and fairness. Finally, the spokesman stated in a solemn tone: Our liberated area military and political authorities have been, are now, and will always be fully responsible for protecting the safety of UNRRA and UNRRA personnel. At a time when the post-war relief plan established by the Three-Party Committee Conference has just begun to be implemented, this incident suddenly occurred, causing all relief work plans to be shelved, disregarding the suffering of the people in the liberated areas. In response, in addition to reporting to Mr. Dong Biwu and formally lodging a protest with the UNRRA China office, we hope that UNRRA will treat everyone equally and quickly send personnel to the liberated areas again to continue their work, which is what the people in the liberated areas eagerly desire.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: According to a report by the Shanghai United Press, UNRRA liaison personnel recently withdrawn from Yantai and Shijiusuo stated: UNRRA relief supplies to the liberated areas accounted for only two percent of the total supplies shipped to China, and those shipped to the Shandong liberated areas accounted for only eighteen percent of the total relief supplies shipped to Shandong Province, while the Kuomintang area of Shandong, with only five percent of the province's population, received over eighty percent of the supplies. The liberated areas urgently needed agricultural machinery, but received only eighteen boxes. Hospitals in the area were in dire need of beds and surgical equipment. Most hospitals lacked thermometers or surgical knives. One hospital had only a small knife left by the Japanese, which was useless because it had been ground down for too long.

　　我山东救委会发言人称
    联总擅撤驻烟台人员漠视解放区救济工作
    【新华社山东二十七日电】联总驻烟台人员突于十日奉命匆匆撤退、联总副署长杰克逊等亦停止来烟巡察一事，引起此间各界纷纷猜测。记者顷特走访山东解放区救委会发言人，询问经过详情及其原因，承蒙发表谈话如下：本月十日联总驻烟山东医务巡回官白克大夫，山东区农业整理主任汤孚德突接“万敬”号船长转来联总青岛署长齐大夫来电，谓因军事形势，促其迅速离烟，暂时撤退返沪。当时白大夫等曾电请缓行未允，我方因未接联总撤退人员正式通知，对彼等离境安全责任颇为顾虑，而行总烟台办事处亦未接到是项通知，曾电询上海行总，迄未见复。白大夫等因青岛方面电促再三，遂于十二日下午随“万敬”号返沪。我方因有行总烟台办事处负责该三氏之安全，虽未接正式文电，乃设宴饯行，并将此事报告驻沪解放区救委会主席董必武氏。据行总驻烟人员谈，上海行总来电称：“此次撤回联总驻烟人员之事，与上海无关。”根据上述情况，此举显系青岛方面所计划者，其用意殊令人难测。发言人继称：国际救济事业决不能因蒋军进攻解放区的军事行动而放弃，此次借口蒋军破坏而擅自撤回联总驻烟人员，停送解放区救济物资，实不符合道义与公平原则。最后，发言人以郑重语气称：我解放区军政当局对联总、行总人员的安全，过去现在和将来都是完全负责保护的。现值三方委员会会议订立的善后救济计划甫在执行之际，突然发生此事件，以致所有救济工作计划陷入搁浅，漠视对解放区人民之灾情，对此我方除报告董必武氏向联总中国分署正式提出抗议外，并希联总一视同仁，迅速派员再到解放区继续进行工作，这是解放区人民所切望的。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据上海合众社报导，最近由烟台、石臼所撤回之联总联络人员称：联总救济解放区物资仅为运华物资总数百分之二，运至山东解放区者仅为运至山东省救济物资总数的百分之十八，而山东国民党区人口仅占全省百分之五，却得物资百分之八十以上。解放区亟需农业机器，但所得者仅十八箱。该地医院病床及外科器材极感缺乏，大部医院无寒热表或外科用的手术刀，某一医院仅有日人留下的小刀一把，且因磨用过久，已无用处。
