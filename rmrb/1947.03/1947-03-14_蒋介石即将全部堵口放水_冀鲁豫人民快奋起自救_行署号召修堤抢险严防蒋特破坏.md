　　Chiang Kai-shek is About to Completely Block the Flow and Release the Water
    People of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces, Quickly Rise Up and Save Yourselves!
    The Administrative Office Calls for Repairing Dikes, Rushing to Prevent Disaster, and Strictly Guarding Against Chiang Kai-shek's Special Agents Sabotage

    [Our Newspaper, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, 11th Dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek, in coordination with his military offensive, will completely block the Huayuankou breach within days, causing all the Yellow River water to flow into the Liberated Areas. The people of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, who have suffered under Chiang's troops, are about to face an even more serious disaster created by Chiang. According to the Shanghai Agreement resolution on the closure of the Huayuankou breach, a decision could only be made after both parties had consulted and inspected the dike restoration project on March 15th to see if it had been completed. Unexpectedly, after the Zhangqiu meeting in December of last year, Chiang's representatives and the American advisor Tadder returned to Kaifeng and arbitrarily released water, flooding the houses and fields of our residents in the riverbed. Later, because the diversion canal that was dug was blocked by quicksand, Chiang's side dug three diversion canals and made every effort to block the breach, changing the flat blocking method to a vertical blocking method (blocking from both sides of the breach towards the middle). It is reported that this project can be completed between the 7th and 12th of this month. Four or five days after completion, the Yellow River water can completely flow into its old course. Our dike restoration project was forced to stop in the past due to Chiang's side's delayed payment of construction funds. Currently, all 37 dangerous sections have not been completed, and 120 miles of dikes in the Shouzhang, Zhangqiu, and Dongping sections have not been repaired. In addition, the Dongming, Changyuan, Changqing, and Qihe sections are located in marginal areas and are disturbed by Chiang's puppet troops. More than 300 miles of dike work have not been repaired. Even the dikes repaired in the first phase have been repeatedly damaged by Chiang's troops. Chiang's planes have continuously bombed the dikes and ships in the old course. Many sections of the dikes must be repaired. Now, Chiang's side is blocking the Huayuankou breach and driving all the Yellow River water into the old course. If our dike work is not repaired, when the spring peach flood season comes, especially when the summer flood season arrives, the water will inevitably overflow and flood our Liberated Areas. Chiang's treachery and viciousness are as clear as fire! The people of the entire Hebei, Shandong, and Henan region have been urgently mobilized to carry out self-rescue and self-defense.

    [Our Newspaper, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, 11th Dispatch] Chiang's side has arbitrarily decided to close the Huayuankou and release water within days. The Administrative Office of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan has issued a letter to the compatriots along the river, calling for them to rise up and save themselves. The letter stated: "Due to Chiang's violation of the agreement and sabotage of the old course dike restoration work, most of the one thousand miles of dikes and all thirty dangerous sections from Changyuan and Dongming to Changqing and Qihe have not been repaired. Although some temporary repairs were carried out after the Yellow River was introduced into the old course, they were destroyed after being attacked by Chiang's planes for a month. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's (UNRRA) assistance in relocating residents of the riverbed was also terminated due to bombing by Chiang's planes. The facts have taught us not to have any illusions about Chiang and the Americans. We should immediately rise up to fight against the upcoming Yellow River disaster. Riverbed residents who have not yet relocated must relocate quickly. Compatriots on both sides of the river must voluntarily repair the dikes and rush to prevent disasters. We must protect the dikes and strictly guard against sabotage by Chiang's special agents. As long as we strive to save ourselves, all of Chiang's attempts to harm the people will be reduced to nothing. At the same time, we must take up arms and go to the self-defense battlefield; the victory of the self-defense war is also the victory of our revenge."

　　蒋介石即将全部堵口放水
    冀鲁豫人民快奋起自救
    行署号召修堤抢险严防蒋特破坏
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】蒋介石配合其军事进攻，日内即将完全堵死花园口口门，使黄水全部流入解放区。遭受蒋军蹂躏的冀鲁豫人民，即将面临蒋贼制造的更严重的灾难。按上海协议决议花园口口门合龙问题，须待三月十五日双方议商视察复堤工程之是否完成，然后方能决定。不料去年十二月张秋会谈后，蒋方代表及美籍塔德顾问回到开封即擅自放水，淹没我河床居民的房屋田地，其后因所挖引河为流沙淤塞，蒋方乃挖掘三道引河，倾全力进行堵口，变平堵法为立堵法（从口门两边向中堵）。据悉该项工程可于本月七日至十二日全部竣工，竣工后四、五日内，黄水即可完全流入故道。我复堤工程过去因蒋方工款迟迟不发，被迫停工，现险工三十七处全部未完成，寿张、张秋、东平段河堤一二○里未修复。此外，东明、长垣、长清、齐河各段处在边缘地区，受蒋伪军扰乱，有三百余里堤工未能修复，即第一期修复之堤工，亦屡遭蒋军破坏，蒋机更连日不断大肆轰炸故道堤工船只。堤工多处必须补修。现蒋方堵死花园口口门，驱使全部黄水流入故道，在我堤工未修复的情况下，至春季桃汛水长，特别是夏季伏汛一来，势必泛水横流，淹没我解放区，蒋贼之奸险毒辣，洞若观火！现冀鲁豫全区人民已紧急动员起来，进行自救自卫。
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】蒋方擅自决定于日内在花园口合龙放水，冀鲁豫行署特发表告沿河同胞书，号召奋起自救，该书称：“故道复堤工作，由于蒋方违约破坏，从长垣、东明至长清、齐河一千里堤岸及全部险工三十余处，大部未能兴修，虽在黄水引入故道后，部分临时抢修，但蒋机持续一月袭击，复被破坏，联总协助河床居民迁移工作，亦因蒋机轰炸而终止。事实教育我们，绝不要对蒋美抱任何幻想，应立刻奋起与即将到来的黄灾搏斗，还未迁移的河床居民要迅速迁移，两岸的同胞要自动起来修堤抢险，要保护堤坝，严防蒋特破坏。只要我们奋自救，蒋贼一切谋害人民之企图必将化为泡影。同时，我们必需拿起武器，奔赴自卫战场；自卫战争的胜利，也是我们复仇的胜利。”
