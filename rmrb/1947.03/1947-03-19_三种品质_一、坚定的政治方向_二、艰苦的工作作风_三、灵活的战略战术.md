　　Three Qualities
    I. Firm Political Direction
    II. Hardworking Style
    III. Flexible Strategy and Tactics
    ·Lin Xi·
    This was the motto personally formulated by Chairman Mao when he directly led the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an from 1937 to 1938. He often explained these three points, and when the trained cadres graduated, he presented them with these three points as a gift. Recently, the Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu Border Region Military District has designated it as the military training for the entire army, requiring cadres and soldiers to understand and apply it well.

    Chairman Mao explained these three points as follows: "A cadre of a people's army should have a firm and unwavering political direction to strive for the cause of the people's liberation. In order to realize this correct political direction, he should not hesitate to endure hardship, even bloodshed and sacrifice. Therefore, every cadre of a people's army must first have the quality of a firm and unwavering political direction."

    Then he explained the second point, saying: "Cadres of the people's army, having the quality of a firm political direction to strive for the cause of the people's liberation, must also possess the quality of a hardworking style necessary to realize this correct political direction. Because the cause of the people's liberation is a very arduous cause, without the training and development of a hardworking style, it is impossible to realize the correct political direction. Therefore, a hardworking style becomes the second quality of cadres of the people's army."

    Finally, Chairman Mao explained the third point, saying: "Cadres in the people's army must not only possess the above two qualities, but also be good at adopting various flexible strategies and tactics to fight the enemy, based on the specific changes in the enemy and our situation, in order to win over allies, isolate the enemy, defeat the enemy, and achieve victory in the cause of people's liberation. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army requires its cadres to have the quality of flexible strategies and tactics when fighting the people's enemies."

    In fact, as long as "strategy and tactics" are not rigidly regarded as military struggle terms, but are used in their meaning in revolutionary struggle, then these three points are not only a school motto and military training, but also a creed for every revolutionary cadre and a motto for every working comrade.

    May I ask: What kind of work does not require a "firm and unwavering political direction to strive for the cause of the people's liberation"? Leading the mass movement for emancipation, without a firm political direction, one will be frightened and confused by landlords and bullies. Organizing production work, without a firm political direction, will lead to speculation, opportunism, and perfunctory work. Even clerical and technical work such as receiving telegrams, keeping accounts, and cutting stencils will not be able to continue without a firm political direction because of fickleness. To use an analogy, having a firm political direction in work is like having a hard bone in the human body. Without it, one cannot stand up or walk. Today, on the eve of the new high tide of the democratic movement, in order to win the victory of the patriotic self-defense war and promote the early arrival of the new high tide, it is even more necessary to especially understand the phrase "not hesitating to shed blood and sacrifice," and to examine at any time whether the firmness of one's own political direction has reached this degree.

    As for the "hardworking style," there is no need for much explanation. The production and economy movement advocated by Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Comrade Bo Yibo is a concretization of this point, and everyone is putting it into practice. If you want to know whether you truly adhere to this point put forward by Chairman Mao and whether you have this quality, you only need to examine whether you are seriously engaged in production and economy, and ask others to evaluate whether you are doing a good job.

    "Flexible strategy and tactics" can also be interpreted as "flexible working methods" in general work. That is to say, one must be good at adapting to the current environment, using existing conditions, uniting activists, promoting advantages, overcoming shortcomings, and creating new methods. Being able to do some of this is considered to have understood this point.

    Thinking carefully about the mistakes or failures in past work, almost all of them were formed by violating some of these three points, that is, by not possessing these qualities. Only then do I deeply understand that memorizing and writing down these three points is easy, but deeply understanding and actually applying them in daily work at all times, without the slightest violation, and letting them truly become qualities that grow on oneself, still requires a process of arduous tempering. For a revolutionary worker, if he wants to maintain these three qualities and often polish them to be bright and fresh, then "self-criticism and criticism" is the best emery.

### 三种品质  一、坚定的政治方向  二、艰苦的工作作风  三、灵活的战略战术

　　三种品质
    一、坚定的政治方向
    二、艰苦的工作作风
    三、灵活的战略战术
    ·林曦·
    这是毛主席一九三七——三八年直接领导延安军政大学时，亲手制定的校训。他常常讲解这三条，当受训干部毕业时，又拿这三条相赠送，最近晋冀鲁边军区政治部，更把它定作全军的军训，要干部和战士都好好来领会并运用它。
    毛主席对这三条是这样解说的，他说：“一个人民军队的干部，他应该具有为人民解放事业奋斗的坚定不移的政治方向，他为了实现这正确的政治方向，就是如何困苦，甚至流血牺牲亦应在所不惜，因此人民军队的每一个干部，必须首先要具有坚定不移的政治方向这个品质。”
    接着他解说第二条说：“人民军队的干部，具有了为人民解放事业奋斗的坚定的政治方向这个品质，他还同时必须具备为实现此正确的政治方向所必需的艰苦的工作作风的品质。因为人民解放的事业是非常艰巨的事业，没有艰苦的工作作风的锻炼和养成，是无法实现正确的政治方向的，因此艰苦工作作风，就成为人民军队干部第二个品质。”
    最后毛主席解说第三条说：“人民军队中的干部，不但要具备上述两种品质，在军事政治斗争中，他还要善于依据敌我具体情况的变化，采取同敌人斗争的各种不同的机动灵活的战略战术，以达到争取同盟军，孤立敌人打败敌人，使人民解放事业取得胜利。因此人民解放军要求他的干部，在同人民的敌人斗争时，还必须具有灵活的战略战术的品质。”
    其实，只要不把“战略战术”呆板当作军事斗争的术语，而采用它在革命斗争中的含义，那这三条就不止是校训、军训，实在是每个革命干部的信条，每个工作同志的座右铭。
    试问：作那一种工作不须要“为人民解放事业奋斗的坚定不移的政治方向”呢？领导群众翻身运动，没有坚定的政治方向，就要被地主恶霸所吓倒、所迷惑。组织生产工作，没有坚定的政治方向，就会流于投机取巧，敷衍塞责。就是收收电报、记记账、刻刻钢板………等事务工作技术工作，没有坚定的政治方向也会见异思迁，干不下去。打个比喻来说，工作之有坚定的政治方向恰象人身之有硬的骨头，如果没有，就立不起来，走不动路。今天处在新的民主运动高潮的前夜，要争取爱国自卫战争的胜利，推动新高潮的早日到来，就更要特别体会“流血牺牲亦应在所不惜”这句话，随时检看自己政治方向的坚定性有没有达到这个度数。
    至于“艰苦的工作作风”一条，无须多加解说，朱总司令和薄一波同志所号召的生产节约运动就是这一条的具体化，大家都正在动手实行，要想知道自己是否真正服膺了毛主席提出的这一条，有没有这种品质，只要自己检看一下生产节约是否认真在做，并请旁人评评做得是否算好，就得了。
    “灵活的战略战术”，在一般工作中，似乎也可以解做“灵活的工作方法”，那就是说，要善于适应当前的环境，运用现存的条件，团结积极分子，发扬优点，克服缺点，创造出新的方法。稍能作到一些，也就算得对这一条有了体会。
    细细回想以往工作中的错误或失败，几乎全是违犯了这三条中的某些条，也就是说没有具备这些品质而形成的。于是才深深懂得：背诵和记下这三条条文是容易的，而深切体会并实际在日常工作中时时运用，不稍违反，让它真正成为生长在自己身上的品质，却还需要一个艰苦磨炼的过程。一个革命工作者，要想使自己保有这三种品质，并且把它常常磨炼得明亮清新，那“自我批评和批评”就是最好的金钢沙。
