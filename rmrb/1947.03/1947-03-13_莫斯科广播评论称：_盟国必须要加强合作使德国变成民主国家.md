Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th: On the eve of the Moscow Conference, a Moscow weekend radio commentary stated: The Moscow Conference must strengthen the cooperation between the Allies which is essential for establishing a solid peace on a democratic foundation. The commentator recalled the statement made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on June 8th last year, in which Molotov said that the German question "is not a question of destroying Germany, but of transforming Germany into a democratic and peaceful country, retaining its resources of industry, agriculture, and foreign trade, and merely depriving it of the economic and military resources needed to become an aggressive power again." The radio commentator continued: The German question may give rise to different opinions in Moscow, but lessons should be drawn from the recently concluded five-nation treaty, and the beneficial work completed by the foreign ministers' representatives in London and by the Allied Control Council, makes people believe that the Moscow Conference may indeed reach a solution to the German question.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Agence France-Presse, Moscow: On the evening of the 9th, a Moscow radio commentator published a commentary entitled "The Soviet Union Strives for World Peace," stating that in the past two years since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has strived to establish world peace while defending the unity of great powers and the equal rights of all countries. The radio commentator recalled the fact that at all national conferences, the Soviet Union deliberated on the consistent resolutions adopted by the great powers, respected the decisions made in Potsdam, and all the steps taken to eliminate fascism. He then talked about the Soviet Union's important position in the United Nations, saying that the Soviet delegation has repeatedly opposed reactionary groups, which have tried to undermine the unity of the great powers in the Security Council. The Soviet Union has proposed disarmament suggestions, which have been satisfactorily adopted by all countries. In drafting the five-nation treaties, the Soviet Union has strived to protect the sovereignty and economic independence of these countries, and has opposed Greece's absurd demands on Bulgaria. The commentator concluded by praising the Soviet Union's work in eliminating militarism and purging Nazis in the German occupation zone. He claimed that only by systematically and powerfully eradicating all remnants of fascism throughout the world can world peace be established.

　　莫斯科广播评论称：
    盟国必须要加强合作使德国变成民主国家
    【新华社延安十一日电】据法新闻社莫斯科九日电：在莫斯科会议开幕的前夕，莫斯科周末广播评论称：莫斯科会议必须加强盟国之间基于民主基础而建立坚固的和平必不可少的合作。评论员追述去年六月八日苏外长莫洛托夫的声明，莫洛托夫曾说德国问题“并不是毁灭德国的问题，而是将德国转变成一个民主而和平的国家，保有它的工业农业，国外贸易的资源，仅仅剥夺它再度成为一个侵略强国所需的经济与军事资源。”广播评论员继称：德国问题或将在莫斯科引起不同的意见，但是应当可能自最近缔结的五国和约中吸取教训，由外长代表在伦敦所完成的以及盟国管制委员会所完成的有益工作，使人相信莫斯科会议确也可能达成对德国问题的解决。
    【新华社延安十一日电】据法新闻社莫斯科讯：九日晚莫斯科广播评论员以题为《苏联为世界和平而奋斗》发表评论称：自战争结束以来的过去两年内苏联曾为建立世界和平而努力，同时并保卫强国的一致及一切国家的平等权利。该广播评论员回忆此种事实即在一切国家会议上，苏联斟酌各强国采取一致的决议，并尊重在波茨顿所作的决定，以及一切为了清除法西斯主义所采取的步骤。他继谈及苏联在联合国中的重要地位时称：苏联代表团曾多次反对反动集团，这些反动集团曾在安理会上设法破坏各强国的一致，苏联曾提出裁军的建议，此建议为一切国家所满意地采取，在起草五国的和约中，苏联曾努力保护这些国家的主权与经济的独立，并曾起而反对希腊对于保加利亚的荒谬的要求。评论员结语对苏联在德国占领区内所实行消灭军阀主义及肃清纳粹的工作予以赞扬。并称：只有有计划地与有力地在全世界根绝一切法西斯主义的残余，才能建立世界的和平。
