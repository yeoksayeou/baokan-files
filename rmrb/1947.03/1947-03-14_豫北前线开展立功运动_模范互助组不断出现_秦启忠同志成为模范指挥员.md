　　The Yubei Front Launches a Merit Campaign
    Model Mutual Aid Groups Continuously Emerge
    Comrade Qin Qizhong Becomes a Model Commander
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] A report from the Yubei Front reporter group: In implementing the mass line leadership method, the main force on the Yubei Front has called for the launch of a merit campaign for the people and the establishment of mutual aid groups, which has achieved significant results. In the Tangyin Campaign, the "Jiang" unit saw the emergence of three different types of model mutual aid groups: (1) Qi Liting Mutual Aid Group. Qi Liting is the company commander of the sixth squad of "Niujiazhuang," a hero who kills enemies. He was the first to rush into the enemy's bunker at Zhao Family Factory and seize the machine gun, but because there was no mutual aid group, he could not seize more spoils of victory. He said, "This time the education for me is the greatest, and it is much more profound than taking classes." This campaign saw him persuade and encourage the entire squad to organize a mutual aid group, and he led the advance with exemplary actions in battle. The entire squad was closely united with him, quickly resolving the battle, seizing a machine gun, ten rifles, a pistol, and ammunition, and capturing prisoners, while strictly abiding by battlefield discipline and the prisoner policy. (2) Hou Zhongjie Mutual Aid Group. Hou Zhongjie is a young soldier from the second squad of the first company of "Zongjiazhuang," who was newly liberated in the Zhao Family Factory battle. In this campaign, he wanted to organize a mutual aid group to earn merit for the people. The organization mobilized two party member soldiers to join his mutual aid group and elected him as the leader. Before the battle, he actively educated his group members, using his own experience to introduce the enemy's internal situation, telling them that the action to attack the bunker must be fierce, that 20 meters away from the bunker is the danger line, that it is less dangerous to go past it, that once at the bunker the enemy has no way to resist, and that we must quickly throw grenades inside. He also told them how to charge under enemy fire, and led the entire group with brave and exemplary actions in battle, closely pursuing the fleeing enemy. They seized a machine gun, thirteen rifles, a pistol, and captured twenty enemies. He used his own example to shout and persuade the enemy to surrender their guns and educated the prisoners. (3) Yang Yushan Mutual Aid Group. This group was composed of four backward elements. Yang Yushan mobilized everyone to help each other "wash away their dishonor" and formulated merit plans for peacetime and wartime. After the mutual aid group was established, everyone became active. During the battle, they rushed to the front. Shi Faling was wounded but did not leave the front line. They were the assault group in the attack on Loujiagou, and they were the first to rush into the village.

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] A report from the Yubei Front reporter group: After summarizing the Tangyin Campaign, the Yubei Front troops specially commended Comrade Qin Qizhong, the model commander, and Comrade Chen Qigui, the model political worker. Comrade Qin Qizhong is the company commander of the first company of the thirty-ninth group of the "Hanyang" unit. Under extremely dangerous circumstances, he resolutely carried out orders, continuously organized seven charges, and finally held the acquired position, protecting the safety of friendly neighbors and his own troops. He is also good at using the mass line's new leadership method, inspiring the masses to think of solutions, study tactics, and actively carry out political work, creating a wave of enthusiasm for killing the enemy and training soldiers. Comrade Chen Qigui is the instructor of the ninth company of the 203rd unit of the "Shenyang" troops. In the critical situation of the Yuanzhuang battle, where the enemy had superior forces several times our own and organized counterattacks, he set an example and called on the ninth company's soldiers to "Earn merit now!" He personally jumped out, picked up a grenade, and led the countercharge against the enemy at the forefront, continuously repelling the enemy's counterattacks several times. Finally, he joined forces with friendly neighbors to defeat the enemy's 106th Brigade of the 40th Division, demonstrating the tenacity of political workers and political work on the battlefield. The front command called on all military and political cadres in the army to learn from Comrades Qin Qizhong and Chen Qigui. (Wang Minzhao)

　　豫北前线开展立功运动
    模范互助组不断出现
    秦启忠同志成为模范指挥员
    【本报讯】豫北前线记者团报导：豫北前线主力部队在执行群众路线的领导方法中，号召开展为人民立功运动及建互助组活动，已获得显著成绩。在汤阴战役中“江”部队出现了三个不同类型的模范互助组：（一）齐力廷互助组。齐力廷是“牛家庄”六班的连长，是一个杀敌英雄，打赵家厂第一个冲进敌人碉堡缴了机关枪，但由于没有互助组，不能缴更多的胜利品。他说：“这回给我的教育最大，比上课可深刻的多”。这次战役，说服鼓舞了全班组织互助组，并在战斗中以模范行动领导前进，全班都紧紧结合着他，很快解决战斗。缴了一挺机枪，十支部枪，一支驳壳枪及子弹俘虏，并严格遵守战场纪律及俘虏政策。（二）侯忠杰互助组。侯忠杰是“宗家庄”一连二班的青年战士，是赵家厂战斗新被解放的。这次战役中他要组织互助组为人民立功，组织上动员两个党员战士参加他的互助组并选他为组长。战前他积极的教育他的组员，现身说法介绍了敌人的内部情况，告诉打地堡的动作要猛，离地堡二十米远是危险线，过去危险就小，到了地堡上敌即无法，我们就要迅速向里边打手榴弹。并告诉在敌火下如何冲锋，战斗中以勇敢的模范行动带领全组，追击中能紧紧掌握穷追敌人。缴了一挺机枪、十三支步枪、一支手枪，俘虏二十个敌人。以自身例子喊话争取敌人缴枪、并对俘虏进行教育。（三）杨玉山互助组。这是四个落后分子组成的，杨玉山动员大家互助“洗刷自己的不光荣”，并订有平时及战时的立功计划。成立了互助组后，个个都变得积极了，战时冲在最前面，史法林负伤不下火线。打娄家沟他们是突击组，他们第一个冲进村里。
