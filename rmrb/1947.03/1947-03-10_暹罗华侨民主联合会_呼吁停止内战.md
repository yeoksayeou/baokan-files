　　Siamese Overseas Chinese Democratic Federation
    Calls for an End to the Civil War
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th (Delayed): The Siamese Overseas Chinese Promoting Homeland Peace and Democracy Federation issued a public telegram on the 26th of last month to Yan'an and Nanjing, stating their opinions on the current national affairs and calling for an end to the civil war. They advocated that "peace should be achieved" on the basis of "conscientiously implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference" and respecting the ceasefire agreement signed by both parties on January 10th of last year, with both parties returning to their original positions prior to January 13th. Regarding Chiang Kai-shek's bogus National Assembly, bogus constitution, and so-called "reorganized government," the telegram pointed out that they all violated the decisions of the Political Consultative Conference.
