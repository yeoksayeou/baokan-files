    After Our Army's Great Victory in Central Shandong, the Enemy in Jinan is Terrified
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in the Jilu豫 Border Region, dated the 23rd] According to visitors from Jinan, after the People's Liberation Army's great victory in Central Shandong, the Chiang troops in Jinan are extremely panicked and have put forward the so-called slogan of "Defending Greater Jinan." Since the 23rd of last month, Jinan has been under emergency curfew for days, and fortifications have been stepped up in all streets, with all able-bodied young men being drafted. The defeated Chiang troops of the 12th, 46th, and 73rd Armies retreating from the Jiaoji Railway Line and Laiwu City have jammed the Jingyi and Jing'er Avenues in Jinan, making them impassable. All hospitals are full, and most of the wounded soldiers cannot be admitted to the hospitals, moaning in the streets, with no one paying attention to them. According to a driver transporting wounded soldiers, "Fortunately, the seriously wounded were all burned; otherwise, Jinan Prefecture would not be able to accommodate the wounded soldiers alone." Commodity prices in Jinan have also skyrocketed as a result. Millet has risen from 600 yuan to 2,000 yuan per jin, and coal costs 1,000 yuan per jin. All kinds of materials are strictly prohibited from leaving the city. Many landlords who fled are also unable to bear the suffering and have returned to the liberated areas. The atmosphere in the city is extremely tense, and the citizens are secretly pleased amidst their worries, hoping that the People's Liberation Army will liberate Jinan soon.

    我军鲁中大捷后济南敌恐惶万状
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】据济南来客谈：人民解放军鲁中大捷后，济南蒋军恐慌万状，提出所谓“保卫大济南”口号。自上月二十三日起，济南连日紧急戒严，各街加紧构筑防御工事，青壮年悉被抓丁。自胶济线及莱芜城退下的蒋军十二军、四十六军、七十三军溃兵，把济市经一、经二两条大马路挤得水泄不通，各医院人满，多数伤兵不能入院，呻吟街头，无人理睬。据运伤兵的汽车夫说：“幸好把重伤号都烧了，不然济南府光伤兵也盛不了。”济市物价也因之飞涨不已，小米每斤由六百元涨至两千元，煤一千元一斤，各种物资严禁出境。不少逃亡地主也不堪其苦，重回解放区。全市空气紧张万分，市民们明忧暗喜，在痛苦熬煎中企盼人民解放军早日解放济南。
