How Xingtai's Backward Villages Broke Through
    Tang Ximin

Around December of last year, when Xingtai County proposed "storming backward villages" and "cutting off feudal vestiges," launching a large-scale turn-over and check-up movement, there were still fifty-one backward villages throughout the county where the situation had not fundamentally improved. Why did so many backward villages still exist under such a large-scale and vigorous movement by the entire population? This was mainly due to the feudal landlords employing all kinds of soft and hard tactics, doing their best to obstruct and sabotage the effort. They controlled almost all of the village cadres, and under the protection of these corrupt village cadres, they concealed themselves.

During the land reform movement, cunning landlords, in collusion with the village cadres they had bought off, staged various forms of sham struggles and schemes to conceal their property. A landlord in Wangjia Village, District One, heard that a turn-over and check-up was coming, knew that it would be difficult to hide if he didn't pretend to struggle fiercely. So, he instructed the village cadres to pretend to arrest him at the village office one night and interrogate him. They tied hay and quilts to the pillars and beat them with sticks to make loud cracking sounds; the landlord pretended to be beaten, crying and begging loudly, intentionally letting the masses hear. Seeing that other villages were displaying the fruits of struggle on the streets, the landlord in Xishimen took the initiative to find someone to display his household furniture in front of his own door. The sham struggle staged by the landlord and village cadres in Dongyangwo, District Six, was even more realistic. They pretended to detain the landlord, held a struggle meeting, and made accusations. The landlord deliberately refused to confess. They pretended to beat the landlord for a while. Finally, the landlord wept and confessed his mistakes, compensated for his wrongdoing, and distributed some gains. However, all those who made accusations and received the gains were people he had bought off, and most of them returned it to him afterward. The landlord in Xisheng Village instructed the village cadres to visit each household and tell the masses not to approach the county and district cadres who were checking and conducting turn-over. As a result, even if the villagers were not gathering firewood during the day, they went to the fields early, and closed their doors and went to sleep as soon as it got dark, making it impossible for our cadres to find an honest villager. When one of our county committee comrades went to Zhaogu Village, District Four, to check on the turn-over, the landlord knew that our comrade would definitely seek out poor people for investigation. So, he specifically asked an old man to wear a good woolen sweater under his ragged cotton robe and deliberately approach our county committee comrade. Seeing that he was wearing ragged clothes on the outside, the county committee comrade thought he hadn't turned-over yet and asked, "Have you turned-over?" "Yes, I've turned over completely this time." Then, he asked, "If you've turned-over completely, why are you still wearing this ragged cotton robe?" The old man opened his robe, showed the woolen sweater to the county committee member, and pointed to it saying, "If I hadn't turned-over completely, where would I have gotten such a good woolen sweater!"... In addition, landlords universally used "voluntary" methods with villagers, distributing their broken furniture, bad clothes, and poor land in large quantities. Superficially, everyone in the village averaged one and a half to two mu of land, but it was not even comparable to half a mu of good waterlogged land owned by the landlord. Coupled with the deceptive propaganda of the landlords, the majority of the masses were also paralyzed. For example, the masses in Kong Village said, "Why is it necessary to struggle? We can turn-over peacefully without struggle!"

Based on these situations, the county committee organized a large-scale inspection team from the bottom up, drawing more than five hundred village cadres from advanced villages in the six districts and combining them with county and district cadres to directly penetrate into the backward villages for a blitz. Because these village cadres were mostly from villages near the backward villages, they were very familiar with the situation in the backward villages. They not only already knew most of the crimes of the landlords in the village, but also had close ties with the farm laborers and poor peasants in the village. In this way, they quickly united with the poor villagers.

After the inspection team entered the backward villages, the first problem they encountered was how to deal with the village cadres controlled by the landlords? Should they pull them in to work together or overthrow them all? Experience has shown that they cannot be relied upon, nor can they be struggled against at the beginning. If we were to pull these village cadres along with one hand and mobilize the masses with the other, then the masses would doubt us; conversely, if we launched a struggle against them from the beginning, it would cause the masses to lose their sense of direction in the struggle. Therefore, at this time, we can only adopt an attitude of ignoring them, putting them aside first, and directly mobilizing the masses. After the masses are mobilized, they will be allowed to examine them. Some will be transformed in the struggle with the masses, and the masses will keep them; some will be incompetent, and the masses will purge them.

Secondly, in order to break through the backward villages, it is necessary to start with directly penetrating the farm laborers and poor peasants, especially paying attention to the honest farm laborers and poor peasants. In the backward villages, many farm laborers and poor peasants have not participated in the organization, and the more honest the farm laborers and poor peasants are, the less mobilized they are. In fact, only by "finding the farm laborers and poor peasants can we find the suffering of the masses, and only by finding the suffering of the masses can we find the feudal exploitation of the landlords." Therefore, at the beginning of the work, we should first find the most honest farm laborers and poor peasants to mobilize them, and after they are mobilized, let them communicate with each other. In this way, all the farm laborers and poor peasants can be quickly mobilized.

When most of the farm laborers and poor peasants in the village have been mobilized, and there are new backbones, they can be organized into several farm laborer and poor peasant groups to participate in the farmers' association together, and then let them unite the middle peasants. Here, it is necessary to remember one point, do not let the newly mobilized farm laborers and poor peasants join the farmers' association in small groups of two or three; otherwise, they will be small in number and lack strength, and they will have no leader. After joining the farmers' association, they will be defeated, bought off, or suppressed by those bad cadres using threats and inducements. Only when they have formed an organizational force and have new leaders, can they combine with the original good elements in the farmers' association to conduct mass examination, remove bad cadres, and improve the organization.

Finally, to mobilize the masses in backward villages, it is necessary to first mobilize them ideologically. The reason why so many backward villages have emerged in the mass movement is that, in addition to the sabotage of the landlords, the lack of ideological awareness among the farm laborers and poor peasants in these villages is also an important reason. Because they still have many confused ideas in their minds, such as the wrong understanding of "conscience," "fate," and "not getting involved first." Therefore, we must especially emphasize starting from ideology. Only by breaking their wrong understandings will they actively participate.

The general experience is: when first finding honest farm laborers and poor peasants, do not talk to them about struggle or say that they are being deceived by the landlords; instead, casually chat with them about the suffering they have endured and encourage them to talk about their sufferings in the old society. Then, gradually guide them to discuss "who caused these sufferings" (the root of poverty)? "Why have other villages turned-over, but our village hasn't?" (compare turn-over) and ask them to compare their own lives with the current lives of the landlords... In this way, a series of systematic education will make the masses deeply realize the evil deeds of the landlords in their village, expose their tricks of deceiving everyone and hiding from the struggle, discover that the struggle against the feudal landlords in the past was extremely incomplete, and unanimously find the target of struggle, and start to work hard.

　　邢台落后村是怎样突破的
    唐西民
    营去年十二月间，邢台县提出“突击落后村”和“割封建尾巴”，开始大规模翻身检查运动的时候，全县尚有五十一个落后村根本没有打开局面。为什么在全体群众这样轰轰烈烈的大运动底下，还会有这么多的落后村存在呢？这主要的是由于封建地主采用了一切软硬办法，竭力阻挠破坏所致。他们差不多全部掌握了村干部，在坏村干包庇之下，将自己掩护起来。
    在土地改革运动中，狡猾的地主们和这些被他们收买了的村干结合起来，演出了形形色色的假斗争和隐瞒财产的骗局。一区王家庄的地主，听说要检查翻身了，知道不假装狠狠的斗争一下，很难再掩避过去，于是授意于村干，在一天的晚上，假装把他抓到村公所里去拷问。一面在柱子上绑上干草和被子，用棒子打的劈劈拍拍的响；一个地主则装做挨打的声气，大声的哭叫哀求，故意让群众听见。西石门的地主，看见各村都把斗争果实摆到街上，他也就主动的找了一个人，把他家里的家具都摆到自己门口来。六区东羊窝地主和村干合演的假斗争更是逼真，装模作样的把地主扣起来，开斗争大会，诉苦，地主故意不坦白，把地主假揍一阵，最后地主痛哭流涕的认了错，赔了东西，也分了果实，只是诉苦和分果实的全是他收买去了的人，分了以后大部都又给他退回去了。西盛村的地主则是叫村干挨门挨户去布置一番，叫群众不要接近检查翻身的县区干部，弄得群众白天就是不拾柴火，也都早早的下地去了，晚上天不黑就关门睡了觉，使我们干部在村里找不到一个老实群众。四区赵孤庄地主，当我们的一个县委同志到该村检查翻身时，他知道我们的同志一定要专找穷人来调查，于是特地叫一个老头子，里面穿了一身很好的毛衣，外边仍旧披上破棉袍，并故意跟我们的县委同志去接近。县委同志看到他外面穿着破衣裳，觉得他还没有翻身，就问他说：“你翻身了么？”“翻身了，这一回可翻透了。”又问他：“你既然翻透了身，为啥还穿这破棉袍呢？”老头子把袍子解开，露出毛衣来给县委看，并指着说：“要不是翻透了身，咱那里有这么好的毛衣穿呵！”……另外，地主们对于村里的群众，普遍的使用了“自愿”的办法，将他的破家具、歹衣服和坏地大量分给群众；从表面上来看，村里每个人都平均有一亩半到二亩的土地了，其实还比不上地主半亩好水地。再加上地主的欺骗宣传，多数群众也被麻痹了。如孔村的群众就这样说：“何必非斗争不行呢？不斗争，和平也能翻身呀！”
    根据这些情况，县委会特自下而上的组织了大规模的检查队，由六个区抽调了五百多个先进村的村干部和县区干部结合起来，直接深入到落后村去突击。因为这些村干部多系落后村附近村里的人，对落后村的一切情况都很熟悉，不仅早已深知该村地主的大部罪行；而且和该村雇贫农也有密切的联系，这样，很快的就和该村的贫苦群众结合起来了。
    检查队进到落后村以后，首先遇到的一个问题，就是如何来对待被地主掌握了的村干部？是拉着他们一起来干呢？还是把他们都打下去呢？经验证明：对他们既不能依靠，也不能一开始就斗争。如果我们是一手拉着这些村干、一手来发动群众，那么，群众就会怀疑我们；反之，如一开始就对他们展开斗争，就会使群众迷失斗争方向。因此，这时对他们只能采用不理的态度，把他们先放到一边，而直接去发动群众，等群众发动起来以后，再让群众去审查他们。一部分和群众在一起斗争中转变了，群众就把他们留下来，一部分不能胜任的，群众会把他们清洗出去。
    其次，要想突破落后村，就必须从直接深入雇贫入手，尤其要注意老实的雇贫农。在落后村里，许多的雇贫农都没有参加组织，越是老实的雇贫农，也就越发没有发动。事实上只有“找到雇贫才能找到群众的痛苦，找到了群众的痛苦，才能找到地主的封建剥削。”所以，在一开始工作时，就应该先找最老实的雇贫农来发动，把他们动员好了，再让他们去互相串通，这样，很快的就可把全部雇贫发动起来。
    当全村大部分雇贫都已发动起来了，并且已有了新的骨干，这时，就可以把他们组成若干雇贫小组，一起参加农会里去，再让他们去团结中农。在这里，需要切记一点，千万不要把新发动的雇贫农三个两个的零星参加进农会去；否则人少势孤，既无战斗力，又无领头人，参加农会以后，就会被那些坏干部用威胁利诱的办法，将他们各个击破，收买或打击下去。只有当他们已经形成了组织力量，并且已有了新的领袖，这时再参加进去，就可以和农会里原有的好分子结合起来，进行群众性的审查，将坏干部撤换，把组织整理完善。
    最后，发动落后村的群众，必须先从思想上发动起来。在大运动中所以产生了这样多的落后村，除了地主的破坏以外，这些村里的雇贫农，思想上尚未觉悟也是一个重要的原因。因为他们在思想上还存在着不少糊涂观念，如“良心”、“命运”、“不沾先”等等错误认识；所以，就必须特别强调从思想上来发动，只有打破了他们的这些错误认识，他们才会积极的干起来。
    一般的经验是：最初找到老实雇贫农的时候，先不和他们谈斗争，或说受地主愚弄；而是和他们随便的闲谈所受的痛苦，启发他们来对旧社会诉苦。然后，再逐步的引导他们讨论“这些痛苦是谁给的”（是穷根）？“为啥外村翻了身，咱村翻不了身？”（比翻身）并叫他们把自己的生活和地主现在的生活比一比看。……如此有系统的一连串的教育下去，群众便会深刻的认识到本村地主的罪恶行为，揭破其欺骗大家隐避斗争的诡计，发现对封建地主过去斗的极不彻底，而一致找到斗争对象，开始大干起来。
