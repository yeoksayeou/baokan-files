　　Head of Relief Addresses:
    Chiang Kai-shek Attempts to Steal and Sell Relief Supplies
    The Chinese People Resolutely Oppose
    Border Region Assembly and Relief Association Also Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Xinhua News Agency reporter recently interviewed Yang Shangkun, head of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association, regarding the Chiang Kai-shek government's request to exchange US$200 million worth of industrial and agricultural supplies from UNRRA for cotton and wheat for sale on the market for profit. Yang issued the following statement:

    The Chiang Kai-shek government's request is actually an attempt to steal and plunder the Chinese people's relief supplies to seek high profits in order to save its increasingly collapsing financial crisis and use it to carry out the civil war. The China Liberated Areas Relief General Association and the people of the liberated areas resolutely oppose this shameless attempt by the Chiang Kai-shek government!

    In the China Liberated Areas, the population suffering from war disasters and deserving relief accounts for more than one-half of the total 42 million disaster victims in China, namely 26 million. Of the total US$535 million in UNRRA relief supplies to China, the suffering people in the liberated areas should receive one-half or at least two-fifths. However, the KMT-controlled relief work monopolizes relief supplies and uses them as a political weapon for its one-party dictatorship, discriminating against the needs of the vast number of war-affected people in the liberated areas. Therefore, although UNRRA has shipped more than 1.55 million tons of relief supplies to China, less than 2% has been distributed to the people in the liberated areas. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA), under the guise of representing all disaster victims in China, has stolen their food, clothing, and other relief supplies to support the KMT's civil war policy, which has long been proven by ironclad facts. To correct this situation that violates the spirit of UNRRA's basic charter and to implement the principle of fair and non-discriminatory relief, the remaining US$200 million in relief supplies must be fully allocated to the liberated areas. We have full and sufficient reason and right to oppose the Chiang Kai-shek government's request to exchange cotton and wheat, and we demand that the UNRRA authorities reject the Chiang Kai-shek government's shameful plan to steal relief supplies from the people of the liberated areas. If UNRRA has not completely forgotten its policies and can value the needs of the people and fairly distribute its relief supplies regardless of race, religion, or political belief, the UNRRA Central Committee must immediately reject the Chiang government's request and allocate all of these US$200 million to the disaster victims in the Chinese liberated areas, consult with representatives of this association, establish direct contact, and carry out relief work for the disaster victims in the liberated areas. Because experience has proven that the ERRCA, monopolized by the KMT, cannot undertake the task of fair relief.

    Regarding the relief supplies needed in the liberated areas, this association submitted a written plan to the UNRRA China Office in January of this year, detailing the proportions of various supplies needed. We request that UNRRA approve the plan submitted by this association and implement it immediately. What the people in the Chinese liberated areas need for relief are mainly medicine, farm tools, and various tools. The wheat and cotton requested by the Chiang government are not for the urgent needs of the people at all, but for the interests of the four major families of the rulers. They will use this wheat and cotton to seek high profits and use them as war funds for the civil war.

    We demand that UNRRA take immediate measures to stop this extremely detrimental behavior to the Chinese people. Otherwise, complying with the Chiang Kai-shek government's request would be tantamount to UNRRA openly assisting Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out the civil war with relief supplies, which the entire Chinese people will resolutely oppose!

    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly and Relief Association jointly telegraphed Mr. Egerton, Director of UNRRA China Office, and Mr. Rooks, Director of UNRRA Washington Office, on the 26th of this month, protesting Chiang Kai-shek's theft and sale of relief supplies and his use of UNRRA's cotton and cloth as military uniforms for the KMT army engaged in the civil war, expressing extreme indignation! The telegram stated: Our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area, with a population of 30 million, suffered severe devastation from the enemy during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and the disaster victims account for 90% of the national disaster victims. However, for more than a year, "Chiang Kai-shek's ERRCA" has only distributed less than 2% of the UNRRA's shipped materials. Not only are the materials very few, but also various obstacles are given in transportation. The materials transported to Shijiusuo and Zhangqin and other places were wantonly bombed by airplanes and damaged, completely violating UNRRA's relief policy. The telegram raised the issue of Chiang Kai-shek's madness in using relief supplies for the civil war, and proposed: supporting Chairman Dong's protest. Furthermore, on behalf of the people of the entire region, we appeal to the world, demanding that UNRRA reject Chiang Kai-shek's request, uphold justice, and directly, fairly, and reasonably distribute relief supplies.

　　解总负责人发表谈话：
    蒋图盗卖救济物资
    中国人民坚决反对
    边区参议会及救济分会亦提出抗议
    【新华社延安二十六日电】新华社记者顷就蒋介石政府要求将联总救济中国价值二万万美金的工业农业物资换为棉花、小麦以便在市场上出售谋利事，走访中国解放区救济总会负责人杨尚昆氏，承杨氏发表谈话如下：
    蒋介石政府这一要求，实际上是企图盗窃劫夺中国人民的救济物资谋取高利，以挽救其日趋崩溃的财政危机和用以进行内战。中国解放区救济总会及解放区人民坚决反对蒋介石政府这一无耻的企图！
    在中国解放区中，遭受战争灾难应当获得救济的人口，占中国全部灾难民四千二百万的二分之一以上，即二千六百万。在联总运华善后救济物资总额五亿三千五百万美金中，解放区受难人民应当获得二分之一或至少五分之二。可是，国民党一党包办的救济工作，垄断救济物资，以救济物资为其一党独裁的政治武器，歧视解放区广大受战争的人民的需要。因此，虽然联总已运到中国一百五十五万余吨救济物资。但分配于解放区人民者却不及百分之二。行总顶冒全中国灾难人民的名义，盗窃了他们的食粮衣服和其他救济物资来支持国民党的内战政策，早已为铁一般的事实所证明。纠正这种违反联总基本条约精神的情势，实行公平救济不加歧视的原则，就必须把现在仅余的二万万元救济物资全数拨交解放区。我们有完全充分的理由和权利反对蒋介石政府掉换棉花、小麦的要求，并要求联总当局拒绝蒋介石政府窃夺解放区人民救济物资的可耻计划。联总假若还没有完全忘却自己的政策，能够重视人民的需要而不分种族、宗教、政治信仰之不同公平分配其救济物资的话，联总中央委员会就须立即否决蒋政府的要求，并将此二万万余美元全数拨归中国解放区的灾难民，与本会代表协商，建立直接联系，进行对解放区灾难民的善后救济工作。因为经验证明，国民党一党包办的行总是决不能担负公平救济任务的。
    解放区所需之救济物资，本会曾于本年一月向联总中国分署提出了书面的计划，并详列所需各项物资之比例。我们要求联总核准本会所提之计划，并立即施行。中国解放区人民需要救济的主要是医药、农具、与各种工具，蒋政府所要求的小麦、棉花，完全不是为了人民的迫切需要，而是为了统治者四大家族的利益。他们将用此项小麦与棉花来谋取高利，充作内战的战费。
    我们要求联总立即采取措施，停止这一对中国人民极端不利的行为。否则，顺应了蒋介石政府的要求，那就无异于联总公开以救济物资援助蒋介石进行内战，全中国人民是会坚决反对的！
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区参议会与救济分会为抗议蒋介石盗卖救济物资，于本月二十六日联合致电联总驻华分署署长艾格顿及华盛顿联总署长鲁克斯，对蒋介石图盗卖价值两万万美元之救济物资及其以联总之棉花、布匹用做进行内战之国民党军之军报，表示极为愤慨！该电内称：我三千万人口的晋冀鲁豫解放区，于八年抗日战争中，遭受敌人之严重摧残，灾难人民占全国灾民千分之九十，而“蒋介石之行总”一年多以来，只分给不及联总运华物资的千分之二。不仅物资甚少，且在运输上给以种种阻难，运至石臼所、张钦等地之物资，又用飞机肆意轰炸，加以损毁，完全违背联总救济政策。该电对蒋介石之丧心病狂，以救济物资用于内战之暴行，提出：拥护联总董主席之抗议。更代表全区人民向全世界控诉，要求联总拒绝蒋介石这一请求，主持正义，直接的公平合理分配救济物资。
