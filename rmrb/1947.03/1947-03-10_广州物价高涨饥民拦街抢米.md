　　Guangzhou's Soaring Prices Lead to Starving People Blocking Streets and抢ing Rice
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] Guangzhou News: A major disturbance occurred in Guangzhou City on the 11th of last month. At both Zhongchang Street and Liu'erSan Road, large numbers of coolies and beggars blocked rice transport vehicles,抢ing grain. The police were unable to stop them. Due to rising gasoline prices, the number of public buses operating in the city, which was over 300, had decreased to around 100 yesterday, and today it has fallen to only 30. The transportation lines have completely stopped. Many rice shops and money houses have automatically ceased trading. The reason for this situation is the plummeting value of the Kuomintang currency. Since the beginning of the month, the price of rice has soared from 70,000-80,000 per shi (unit of dry measure for grain) to over 100,000 (reaching 160,000 on February 13th).

　　广州物价高涨饥民拦街抢米
    【新华社延安七日电】广州讯：（迟到）广市上月十一日发生大混乱，中长街及六二三路两处均有大批苦力及乞丐阻挡运米车辆，抢夺粮米，警察亦不能制止。全市三百余辆公共汽车，因汽油涨价，昨日行驶者亦减至百辆左右，今日竟减至三十辆，交通线完全停顿。米店钱庄多自动停止交易，造成此种情况之原因为蒋币暴跌。自月初以来，米价每石由七八万骤涨到十余万（按二月十三日涨到十六万）。
