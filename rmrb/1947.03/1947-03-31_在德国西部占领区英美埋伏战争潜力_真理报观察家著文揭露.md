    In the Western Germany Occupation Zone
    Britain and the United States Bury War Potential
    Pravda Observer Publishes Article Revealing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th] TASS reports: Pravda observer Ma Jin wrote an article stating: Vansittart's (Note: Vansittart is a British expert on German issues, a Conservative) new clamor exposes the essence of the British side's subtle manipulation of the German issue. Vansittart's "economic plan" for Germany is basically this: First, Germany must be deprived of the possibility of developing its export trade; second, it must abandon the compensation plan adopted by the Potsdam Conference. This kind of "economic plan" only stems from one goal, which is to make the German economy subordinate to the interests of British and American capital. Regarding the current situation in Western Germany, Ma wrote: Many facts make people believe that the policy of the British and American occupation authorities is to maintain the level of German peacetime industry at an extremely low level, actually freezing it; at the same time, they refuse to take all necessary measures to completely destroy Germany's war potential. Not long ago, the British and American occupation authorities stopped dismantling equipment used to pay compensation, so the most important resolution of the Potsdam Conference has been practically abandoned. Since then, the British and American occupation authorities have taken unilateral actions in terms of compensation, and their scale is growing. Against this background, the connection between the strategies of some British and American people regarding the level of German industry and the compensation issue becomes obvious. The British and American occupation authorities artificially put the industry in the Western German occupation zone at an extremely low level, thereby creating the premise of refusing to meet the Soviet Union's reasonable demands for payment of compensation. British and American capitalists in Germany are extremely active in at least two aspects: first, they are rapidly taking over the former German market; second, they have completely taken over all management rights of German import and export trade. It is worth noting that the United States is not satisfied with seizing Germany's capital position; the United States is conducting a solid offensive against Britain's economic position in Germany, and the merger of the British and American occupation zones means that the United States has achieved the result of "killing two birds with one stone."

    在德国西部占领区
    英美埋伏战争潜力
    真理报观察家著文揭露
    【新华社陕北廿七日电】塔斯社讯：真理报观察家马顷著文称：范西塔特（按：范西塔特系英国的德国问题专家，保守党人）新出喧嚷，暴露了英国某些方面关于德国问题的立场施巧妙权术的本质。范西塔特的对德国“经济计划”，基本上就是这么一个东西：第一、德国得被剥夺发展其出口贸易的可能性；第二、放弃履行波茨顿会议所通过的赔偿计划。此种形式的“经济计划”，只是出自一个目标，即使德国经济隶属于英美资本的利益。论及目前德国西部之形势时，马写道：许多事实使人相信英美占领当局的政策，在于使德国平时工业维持极低之水平，读者实际上使它冻结；同时又在于拒绝以一切必要之措施，实现完全摧毁德国工业的战争潜在力。不久以前，英美占领当局停止了拆卸作为支付赔偿之用的装备，因而波茨顿会议的最重要决议已经实际上放弃，此后英美占领当局在赔偿方面，即采取了单方面的行动，其规模自在增长中。在此种背景之下，某些英美人士关于德国工业水平的策略与关于赔偿问题的策略间的瓜葛就显而易见了。英美占领当局人工的将德国西部占领区的工业置于极低水平，从而制造拒绝满足苏联关于支付赔偿合理要求的前提。在德国的英美资本家们至少在两方面是极端活跃的：一、他们正在迅速的掌握着以前之德国市场；二、他们已全部接管了德国出入口贸易的一切经营权。值得注意的，是美国并不以夺取德国资本之地位为满足，美国正在进行着一个反对英国在德国之经济地位的坚固攻势，英美占领区的合并，即意味着美国已收“一石双鸟”的结果。
