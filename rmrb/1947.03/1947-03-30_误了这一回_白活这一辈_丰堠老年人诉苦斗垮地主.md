    "Miss This Time, Wasted This Life"
    Elderly People in Fenghou Complain and Overthrow Landlords
    [Reported from Zuoquan by this newspaper] After the adjustment of the relationship between cadres and the masses in Fenghou Village, Zuoquan, achievements were made in mobilizing the "backward" to thoroughly squeeze out feudalism. Cadres and activists first went to various households to investigate and found that most peasants had not yet poured out all their grievances, the elderly had even more, and the landlords had not truly bowed their heads. Immediately, a campaign was launched to encourage backward elderly people to "pour out all their grievances and overthrow the landlords." Under the slogan "Miss this time, wasted this life," after a day of communication and preparation, Fan Gengcheng, a backward old man with the deepest suffering, was first mobilized to voluntarily demand to speak out his grievances. At the grievance meeting, he first said: "The local tyrant landlord, Sun Daqing's family, lost eighty-four silver dollars. He clearly knew it was his own family who did it, but he falsely accused me of stealing them, forcing me to confess, and beat me until I was a mess. Then he押 (put under custody) me to the village office. The village chief was from his own family. He immediately said, 'It's easy to handle if you confess honestly, otherwise, I'll sentence you to life imprisonment.' I was already half-dead from the beating, and I thought about how my whole family relied on my own labor to eat. I had no choice but to confess randomly. But I couldn't come up with the silver dollars right away. Sun Daqing forced me to sell my broken house, bad land, and rotten furniture. Finally, I sold my own daughter to pay off this unjust debt. My family was forced to beg along the streets... Sun Daqing indulged in extravagance, but I was left to suffer from hunger and cold in the temple..." Speaking of this, Old Man Fan burst into tears, and the masses present also shed tears. On the spot, two-thirds of the backward old men were guided to pour out their grievances. In their complaints, they revealed the various destructive actions of the landlords, such as conspiring to buy people off, sowing discord, spreading rumors, and threatening. The masses indignantly proposed the slogan: "Thoroughly overthrow the landlords!" The next day, a struggle meeting was held. The "backward" old men repeatedly told the activists: "Today, you stay behind a bit and let us old men come to the front." When struggling against Sun Daqing, Old Man Fan first spoke out his grievances. When he spoke of being forced to sell his own daughter, the old men were all furious and shouted to beat the landlord. Sun was overthrown this time and finally completely bowed his head, willing to sell all his property to repay his blood debts. The next day, the landlord Song Shifu was also struggled against. Song frankly admitted his various conspiracies to undermine the masses. The old men excitedly said: "The spring movement was a cadre movement, the summer movement was a representative movement, but this time it is a mass movement. This time, we can say that we have overthrown the landlords!" After this struggle, the activists in the village overcame their complacency of looking down on the "backward" as useless, and the class consciousness of the peasants was raised to an unprecedented level.

    “误了这一回  白活这一辈”
    丰堠老年人诉苦斗垮地主
    【本报左权讯】左权丰堠村干群关系调整后，在发动“落后”深入挤封建上获得成绩；干部积极分子首先分头深入各户调查，发现大部农民尚未倒净苦水，老年人苦水还多，地主亦未真正低头。当即发动落后老年人“诉净冤苦，斗倒地主”。在“误了这一回，白活这一辈”的口号下，经一天的串通酝酿，首先发动起痛苦最深的落后老汉范更成，自动要求诉苦。在诉苦会上他先说：“恶霸地主孙大庆家丢了八十四块现洋，明明知道是他自己家里干的，非冤枉是俺偷了，逼着招认，把俺吊打得成了烂蒜，又把押到村公所，村长是他自家人，劈头就说：“好好承认事情好办，不然就判你个无期徒刑。”俺早被打成半死，想起一家老小全靠自己一手劳动吃饭，只好胡乱承认了。可是一时拿不出现洋，孙大庆逼着把破房、坏地，烂家具全部变卖，最后把亲生闺女卖了才算还了这笔冤债，一家人逼得沿街要饭………孙大庆花天酒地，俺可落得在神堂里忍饥受冻……。”说到这里，范老汉老泪俱下，在场群众亦都掉出眼泪。当场有三分之二落后老汉被引导着倾倒苦水，诉苦中挤出了地主阴谋收买，拨挑离间，造谣威胁的种种破坏行动。群众激愤提出：“彻底斗垮地主”的口号。次日即召开斗争大会，“落后”老汉们纷纷叮嘱积极分子：“今天你们靠后些，叫俺老汉们上前头。”斗争孙大庆时，范老汉首先诉苦，说到被逼出卖亲生闺女时，老汉们都奋怒高呼要打地主。孙这一下可被斗倒了，至此始完全低头，情愿倾家荡产还血债。次日又斗争地主宋世富，宋坦白承认自己种种破坏群众的阴谋。老汉们兴奋的说：“春天运动是干部运动，夏天运动是代表运动，这一回才叫大家运动，这一下可算把地主斗倒啦！”该村经过这次斗争，积极分子克服了轻视“落后”不顶事的自满情绪，农民阶级觉悟空前提高。
