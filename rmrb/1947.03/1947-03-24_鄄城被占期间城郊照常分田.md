(Reported by our newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 22nd) During the second occupation of Juancheng by the Chiang Kai-shek troops (the county was recovered by our army on the 3rd of this month), the local land reform continued as usual. Before the enemy arrived, the democratic government vigorously suppressed local tyrants and landlords to support the masses. For example, in the ninth district, they suppressed major local tyrants on the one hand and convened meetings of landlords and puppet organizations on the other, making them automatically guarantee to behave themselves. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Juancheng for the second time, the landlords did not dare to react, and the masses saw our armed work teams active every day. The villages around the city, amidst the sounds of gunfire, monitored the enemy on the one hand and continued the land-to-the-tiller movement on the other. In Wangzhuang and Xionglou, only two miles north of the city, more than 700 farmers persisted in distributing grain. They said: "If the 'disaster army' enters the village, we will fight them; if they leave the village, we will distribute grain." On the 28th of last month, when the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the city briefly invaded the northeast, 95 percent of the villages in the urban area were involved in the struggle to distribute grain and land. After the recovery, the climax of the struggle rose again.

    鄄城被占期间城郊照常分田
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】蒋军二次侵占鄄城（该县已于本月三日为我军收复）期间，当地土地改革照常进行。在敌人未到时，民主政府大力镇压恶霸地主，给群众撑腰，如九区即一面镇压大恶霸一面召开地主及伪大会，使其自动保证安分守己。在蒋军第二次侵占鄄城时，地主即不敢反动，加之群众每天都见到我武工队活动，城周各村庄在炮火声中，一面监视敌人，一面仍照常进行土地还家运动，距城北仅二里的王庄、熊楼七百余农民仍坚持分粮，他们说：“遭殃军进村，咱就和他干，出村咱就分粮。”上月二十八日城内蒋军一度向东北进犯时，城区百分之九十五的村子都卷入分粮分田斗争，收复后斗争高潮又起。
