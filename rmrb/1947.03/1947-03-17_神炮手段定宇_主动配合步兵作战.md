　　Divine Artilleryman Duan Dingyu
    Actively Cooperates with Infantry Operations

    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th] Duan Dingyu, an artillery company commander from a certain unit in Taiyue, who was selected as one of the People's Heroes, created a brilliant example of artillery actively cooperating with infantry in the Lüliang Campaign. Throughout the entire campaign, all three hundred of their shells hit their targets, providing strong support to the infantry. During the Puxian battle on January 1st, the company used over a hundred shells from its position on the eastern outskirts to cover the infantry as they continuously took down six enemy positions in half a day, achieving perfect accuracy. In the siege of Xiaoyi City, two companies of a certain unit were surrounded by an enemy several times their size. Company Commander Duan took the initiative to rush to the forward position and, with nine consecutive accurate shots, routed the enemy, allowing the two companies to withdraw safely. Company Commander Duan is creative in his work, modifying artillery to ensure that it hits the target 100% of the time within 100 meters. When shooting, he does not use any testing equipment at all; he only needs to look with his eyes to be without deviation. In summarizing his shooting experience, he said, "Artillerymen also need to build fortifications, and the artillery must be mounted stably to avoid vibrations that cause deviations or damage the firing pin. If the weather is cold, you can first use medicine to heat the artillery to prevent it from being destroyed. At the beginning of the firing, it is not advisable to put too much medicine; you can put more medicine after firing a few times."
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th] The People's Heroes Conference of a certain column, which lasted for six days, officially closed on the 5th. The heroes who attended the meeting exchanged experiences in depth, inquired and talked with each other, and sent representatives to visit. After listening to typical reports, they generally studied and brewed, setting off a heat wave of learning technology to improve tactics. Comrade Liu Youguang, the political director of the column, pointed out six common characteristics of the heroes in his summary, calling on everyone to learn from them. First, the spirit of the heroes to serve the people and their firm and tenacious determination to achieve their plan to annihilate the enemy. Director Liu used the words of the hero Li Wan on the battlefield, "The Eighth Route Army is only allowed to advance one foot, not retreat one inch," as a representative of this characteristic. Second, hard struggle with both wisdom and courage. Director Liu used the heroic stories of the heroes on the battlefield to explain "whoever can overcome difficulties can win." He pointed out that the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth characteristics of the heroes are love for oneself, hatred for the enemy, obedience to orders, faithful implementation of the policy of treating prisoners, and reliance on the masses. After expounding the important significance of these characteristics, Director Liu encouraged everyone not to be proud after returning to the team, but to add merit to merit. And lead more heroes to make new plans to kill the enemy and annihilate more enemies. Learn from the Shandong Liberated Area, fight more victories, overcome shortcomings, and maintain the glorious title of "not violating the slightest of the people" of the whole army. Chen Xiping, a model commander among the heroes, responded to the hopes of the conference by saying: "I have learned the village warfare, and I will tell the brothers about the experience separately when I go back." Reconnaissance squad leader Jia Lianxin is determined to abide by battlefield and mass discipline and establish greater achievements. Finally, after passing congratulations on the great victory in Shandong and a letter of thanks to all circles in Taiyue, the whole group shouted slogans such as "Serving the people to the end" and "Victory, victory, and more victory" and dispersed the meeting.

　　神炮手段定宇
    主动配合步兵作战
    【本报太岳十五日电】太岳某部被选为人民功臣之一的炮兵连长段定宇，在吕粱战役中创造了炮兵主动配合步兵作战的光辉范例。在整个战役中，他们的三百发炮弹全部命中，对步兵作了有力的支援。一月一日蒲县战斗时，该连在东郊外阵地上以百多发炮弹，掩护步兵于半日内连续打下敌人六个阵地，作到弹无虚发。在孝义城围攻战中，某部两个连被数倍于我之敌包围，段连长主动赶至前锋阵地，接连以九颗必中炮弹，将敌击溃，两个连安全撤出。段连长在工作上富于创造性，改造大炮，保证在一百米内百发百中。他在射击时完全不用任何测试器械，只需用眼一看，便无偏差。他在总结自己的射击经验时说：“炮兵同样须作工事，必须把炮架稳，以免震动而生偏差，或打坏撞针。若遇气候寒冷，可先用药将炮烘烘，防止炮被炸毁，在开始打时不宜多放药，打几下后才可多放药。”
    【本报太岳十五日电】某纵队人民功臣大会先后进行六天，已于五日正式闭幕。到会各功臣会深入的交流经验，互相询问谈心，推派代表参观。在听取典型报告后，即普遍研究酝酿，掀起学习技术提高战术的热潮。纵队政治主任刘有光同志，在总结中指出功臣们共同的六个特点，号召全体学习。一、功臣们为人民服务的精神及其坚决顽强实现自己歼敌计划的决心。刘主任以英雄李万在战场上所说“八路军只许前进一尺，不许后退一寸”，作为这种特点的代表。二、坚苦奋斗智勇双全。刘主任以功臣们在战场上的神勇故事、说明“谁能克服困难，谁就能胜利”。他指出功臣们三、四、五、六等项特点为对己热爱、对敌人狠，服从命令，忠实执行俘虏政策，依靠群众等。在阐述这些特点的重要意义后，刘主任勉励大家回队后不要骄傲，要功上加功。并带领更多的英雄订出新的杀敌计划，更多的歼灭敌人。向山东解放区学习，多打胜仗，克服缺点，保持全军的“秋毫无犯”的光荣称号。功臣中模范指挥员陈西平回答大会的希望说：“自己学会了村落战，回去要将经验分别讲述给弟兄们。”侦察班长贾连新决心遵守战场及群众纪律，建立更大的功劳。最后通过祝贺山东大捷及致太岳各界谢信后，全体高呼“为人民服务到底”、“胜利，胜利，再胜利”等口号散会。
