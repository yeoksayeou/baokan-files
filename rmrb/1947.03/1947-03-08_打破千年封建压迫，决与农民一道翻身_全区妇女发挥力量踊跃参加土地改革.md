　　【Our Newspaper Special Dispatch】 In the land reform movement, due to the universal increase in peasant awareness, women's awakening has been greatly inspired. They realize that their suffering is inseparable from the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords. Many women, who in the past had coveted the small favors of landlords, secretly hid things for landlords, and opposed their husbands' participation in the struggle, have, once awakened, confessed and reported themselves, completely separating from the landlords. Experience in various places has proven that without the class awakening and active participation of women in overturning their lives, it is difficult to completely eliminate the feudal rule of landlords in rural areas. After the women of Shouzhisudian Village awakened, they brought out over a hundred packages of hidden property of the landlords. The women's movement has broken through the past isolated situations of anti-abuse, anti-old ethics, and even opposition to peasant associations. In the critical period of participating in war preparations along the Taihang-Pinghan line, women and the elderly stayed in the villages to settle accounts with landlords, capture special agents, and the movement has never been interrupted. In Xiajin, Enxian, Jixian, Chengwu, and other places in southern Hebei, women tenant farmers and debtor women, along with those who had served as maids, concubines, wet nurses, and female servants for landlords in the past, colluded with each other to express their grievances, standing in the crowd for the first time to accuse the landlords and bullies of their oppression and humiliation. Now, in the peasant associations in various places, a large number of poor women members have been absorbed, and women's departments of the peasant associations have been established, marking a new unity between the women's movement and the peasant movement. In Wu'an, women who have joined the peasant association account for one-fourth to one-third or more of the peasant members. In various land distribution and deliberation meetings, there are female councilors elected jointly by all the peasants. Facing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and the landlord's counter-offensive in Linzhang and Daming, women competed with each other to take up red-tasseled spears and rifles to stand guard, patrol the villages. In Yaoshan and other places, women voluntarily participated in the militia, playing a significant role in defending the overturning of their lives. In Jiyuan, Fushan, and other places, men fought on the mountaintops, while women divided the land in the gullies, finally completing the initial land reform amidst the sound of gunfire. Experience in various places has proven that in places where women are well-mobilized, families are harmonious. Disagreements between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law are more easily resolved reasonably after mediation. Women have changed their old concept of relying on men, and men have changed their old concept of underestimating women. The masses in Diantou said: "Even without the men, women alone can overwhelm the landlords!" In the peasant families in Datun Village, Linxian, the phenomenon of discord between husband and wife, and quarrels between mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law, and sisters-in-law has been eliminated by eighty or ninety percent. Many villages have produced well-respected women leaders and female labor heroes. More than one-third of the women cadres in Guanxian have participated in leadership work, and half of the more than six hundred new activists in Rencun, Linxian, are women. Many women have been elected as village chiefs, deputy village chiefs, chairpersons of peasant associations, etc.

　　打破千年封建压迫，决与农民一道翻身
    全区妇女发挥力量踊跃参加土地改革
    【本报特讯】土地改革运动中，由于农民觉悟的普遍提高，大大启发了妇女的觉醒，他们认识到自己的痛苦原来和封建地主的压迫剥削是分不开的。许多妇女，过去曾贪图地主的小便宜，暗给地主藏东西，反对自己丈夫参加斗争，但一经觉醒，纷纷坦白自报，彻底与地主分家。各地经验均曾证明，没有妇女的阶级觉醒与积极参加翻身，就很难完全取消地主在农村的封建统治；授治苏店村妇女觉醒后，即拿出百余包地主的隐蔽财物。妇女运动已突破过去孤立的反虐待、反旧礼教，以至和农会对立的局面。太行平汉沿线各县在参战备战紧急时期，都是妇女和老人留在村里清算地主，捉拿特务，运动迄未中断。冀南夏津、恩县、冀县、城武等地，佃户债户妇女与过去给地主当过使女、小老婆、奶娘、女佣，互相串通诉苦，第一次站在人群广众中，控诉地主恶霸对她们的压迫、侮辱。现在各地农会中，都吸收了大批贫苦的妇会员，成立了农会妇女部，标志着妇运与农运新的统一；武安加入农会的妇女，占农会员四分之一至三分之一以上，各种分田评议会中，均有全体农民共同选出的女评议员；临漳、大名妇女面临蒋介石的进攻和地主的反攻，他们一个一个争先拿起红缨枪、步枪站岗放哨，巡逻村庄；尧山等地，妇女自动参加民兵，在保卫翻身中起了很大作用；济源、浮山等地，男人在山顶打仗，女人在山沟分田，终于在炮火声中初步完成土地改革。各地经验证明，妇女发动好的地方，家庭和睦；婆媳不和，经过调解比较容易得到合理解决。妇女改变了依靠男人的旧观念，男人改变了轻视妇女的旧观念。店头群众说：“就是没有汉们，光妇女也能压倒地主！”林县大屯村农民家庭中夫妻不和、婆媳妯娌争吵现象已消灭十之八九。许多村庄已产生出众望所归的妇女领袖与女劳动英雄；冠县三分之一以上的妇女干部都参加了领导工作，林县任村新积极分子六百余人中，一半是妇女。不少妇女被选为村长、村副、农会主席等。
