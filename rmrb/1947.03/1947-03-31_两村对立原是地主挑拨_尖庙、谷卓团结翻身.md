    The antagonism between Jianmiao and Guzhuo villages in the fourth district of Zuoquan, created by the instigation of feudal landlords, was not resolved until the current conscious unity movement. The two villages share an administrative village. During the overthrow movement, each village protected its own village's landlords and exclusively attacked landlords from the other village. For example, when struggling against the Guzhuo landlord Chen Yishi, the people of Guzhuo did not act, while the people of Jianmiao were very active; when struggling against the Jianmiao landlord, the people of Jianmiao did not act. As a result, the landlords took advantage of loopholes and left remnants, preventing the peasants of both villages from completely overturning the feudal system. This "knot" was not formed overnight. For example, in past years' assignments of labor service, because the main cadres and the cadres assigning the labor were from Jianmiao, although Jianmiao had more people than Guzhuo, Guzhuo provided more labor service. The people of Guzhuo all said, "The Jianmiao cadres are powerful and tough and can withstand the demands." At the same time, the Jianmiao cadres showed contempt for the Guzhuo cadres in various tasks. In this unity movement, the cadres of both villages enlightened class consciousness based on a deep understanding of the principle that "all peasants under heaven are one family, and landlords on earth are equally blackhearted." A meeting was held to resolve the "knot." At the meeting, in an atmosphere of unity, the opinions were expressed one by one, and after a review, all the "knots" were readily solved. Everyone laughed and said, "We are like the Dragon King's temple flooded by the great water, one family not recognizing another family. Landlords deceive people, big villages bully small villages, these are all things done by the landlords. Protecting our own village's landlords is beneficial to the landlords; we cannot overthrow feudalism. We peasants must not be exploited by the landlords again." In this way, hatred was concentrated on the landlords. Now the peasants of the two villages are united and determined to join forces to completely defeat the landlords of both villages.

    两村对立原是地主挑拨
    尖庙、谷卓团结翻身
    【本报太行二十九日电】左权四区尖庙、谷卓两村，在封建地主的挑拨下所造成的对立，直至目前的自觉团结运动中，才算解开。两村有一个行政村，翻身运动中，两村各自包庇本村的地主，专门外村地主。如斗谷卓地主陈义时，谷卓人不动手，尖庙人很积极；斗尖庙地主时，尖庙人就不动手了。这样，地主钻了空子留下尾巴，致两村农民都没有翻透身。这“圪塔”不是一下结成的，如历年派差中，因主要干部和拨差干部是尖庙的，尖庙虽比谷卓人多，但出差没有谷卓多。谷卓人都说：“尖庙干部又大又硬，能抗住门市。”同时，尖庙干部在各种工作上，表现出看不起谷卓干部。此次团结运动，两村干部从深刻认识“天下农民是一家，地上地主一般黑”的道理上，启发了阶级觉悟。召开了解“圪塔”会。会上，两村在团结的空气中，将意见一一说出，一一检讨后，所有的“圪塔”均迎刃而解。大家笑哈哈的说：“咱是大水冲了龙王庙，一家不认的一家人。地主欺骗人，大村欺小村，这都是地主办的事。各地包庇本村地主，是对地主有利，咱不能翻身。咱农民可不能再受地主利用了。”这样，仇恨都集中到了地主身上。现两村农民已团结一致，决心合力彻底斗垮两村地主。
