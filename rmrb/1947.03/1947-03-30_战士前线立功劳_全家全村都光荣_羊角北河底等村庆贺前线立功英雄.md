    Soldiers Earn Meritorious Service on the Front Lines
    The Whole Family and Village are Honored
    Yangjiao, Beihe, and Other Villages Celebrate Heroes with Meritorious Service on the Front Lines
    [Our Newspaper, Zuoquan News] Last month, on the 27th, Yangjiao in the Fifth District of Zuoquan received a commendation list from the Political Department of the Military Command, reporting that Hou Cunzheng, a soldier from the village, persisted for a whole day and night in the battle to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Yutai, repelling seven enemy counterattacks and finally eliminating the enemy. Zhang Xianting, Zhang Rui, and Wu Er’man bravely and resolutely obeyed orders in the Juye battle, erecting ladders to climb the city walls, eliminating the enemy, and completing their missions, all becoming heroes in killing the enemy. The news immediately spread throughout the village. On March 7th, more than 500 people from the entire village gathered to celebrate. The chairman of the farmers' association immediately guaranteed that they would take good care of the land for the families of the soldiers, and that there would be no difficulty in providing firewood and water. Then, Hou Macheng, a family member, said: My brother has only been in the army for less than a year and has already become a hero. I am a former rich peasant, and the masses have taken extra care of me during the turn-over movement. I will write to my brother and tell him to focus on killing the enemy. Zhang Xianting's mother, wearing her new clothes from the turn-over, went on stage and said with a smile: "This time I have turned myself over, and I have been allocated cattle, houses, and land. My son has also become a hero, and everyone is helping me with planting and cutting firewood. Please tell my son to defeat Chiang Kai-shek before he comes back to see me."
    When the masses of Shihuiyao Village posted the commendation list at the home of Comrade Zhang Rongtang, his mother said: My Rongtang was a lazy child at home. He joined our Eighth Route Army, and they educated him well, and now he has become a hero. I will spin and weave well at home and become a spinning and weaving hero. (Renjie, Shuping, Yuxiu, Zemin)
    [Our Newspaper, Wu'an News] Beihe Village in the Eighth District received a commendation list sent by a unit of the People's Liberation Army on the front line, reporting the news of Liu Shengyuan's meritorious service in the village. Farmers from the entire district flocked to congratulate him with gifts. The entire village of Beihe was covered with red and green slogans. The whole street was freshly washed, and nine glorious flags fluttered in the wind at the hero's door, along with a gold-lettered plaque presented by the entire district. A Yangge team and a theatrical troupe of nineteen people came to celebrate, entering the venue with gongs and drums. At the meeting, the chairman reported on the heroic deeds of Liu Shengyuan: "Holding a gun and confronting the enemy for six hours, killing eight enemies." The masses cheered and celebrated. Shengyuan's mother said, "My Shengyuan voluntarily joined the army last year, and he has become a hero in less than half a year. Today, everyone has come to congratulate him and give gifts. This is something I never dreamed of."
