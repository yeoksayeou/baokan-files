    [News from Lingchuan, by our newspaper] After the land reform movement, the Sixth District of Lingchuan discovered that in thirteen villages, due to the lack of unity between cadres and the masses, many honest farmers had not been mobilized. It was also found that over seventy old problems and two hundred and forty new problems from past movements had not been resolved. In Xigou Village, within this district, 490 members of the peasant association were afraid to speak out, with 115 members storing things for landlords, and 46 "backward" farmers also storing things for landlords. After investigation, the village cadres all conducted sincere self-criticism and resolved to thoroughly solve the above problems. Cadres of Xiaozhao Village said: "This time, we will first make self-criticisms to the masses, and let the masses offer their opinions. Then we will solve other problems."
