    Taiyue Primary and Secondary Schools Actively Participate in Production
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 28th dispatch] According to reports from the primary and secondary school communications group: Shimin Middle School, Jinan Middle School, and primary schools in Gaoping, Jincheng, Yangcheng, and other places are enthusiastically engaged in production. Wangxi Primary School in Shimin pays attention to spring plowing propaganda, establishing ten family blackboard newspapers. Students created 28 production songs and “banhua” (a form of short, rhythmic propaganda). For example, elementary school student Wang Xiaobian's "Mutual Aid is Good" banhua: "Mutual aid is good, mutual aid makes work really good, tilling the land more, hoeing the land early, careful cultivation makes crops good, land that should be hoed once, mutual aid hoed twice, land that should be hoed twice, mutual aid hoed three times. Big ears of grain, plump grains, the grain harvest is really good, everyone participates in the mutual aid group, the benefits of mutual aid are endless." This banhua played a stimulating role in the organization of labor in the village. Jin Feng Village Primary School formed a broadcasting Yangko team to promote spring plowing at the Daduicun land distribution rally. Many students voluntarily offered to help military families, martyrs' families, and emancipated farmers with spring plowing. Thirty-six teachers and students from Jincheng No. 2 Normal School helped martyrs' families transport manure, reclaim wasteland, and repair levees. Yangcheng Shangqin Elementary School stipulates that Sundays are rest days, and students take turns carrying coal, carrying water, delivering manure, and farming for military families. Huzhuang Primary School held a parents' meeting to discuss production issues, stipulated a half-day system, with children going to school in the morning and participating in family production in the afternoon. In one month, teachers and students of Jinan Middle School earned more than 270,000 yuan from spinning, weaving, transportation, and milling, without affecting their studies due to production.
