　　Four Foreign Minister Representatives Hold Meeting
    Discuss the German-Austrian Treaty Issue
    Soviet Representative Advocates Giving Germans the Opportunity to State Opinions and Restricting Austrian Air Force Bases and Armaments
    [This Newspaper Dispatch] TASS Moscow, March 12th: The Foreign Minister Representatives' meeting on German issues began discussing the preparatory procedures for the German treaty on the morning of March 12th. The results of the London Representative Conference allowed the Foreign Minister conference to obtain reports from the four powers' governments outlining their opinions on deciding this procedure. The London Foreign Minister Representative Conference agreed that the German treaty should be drafted by the four governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The four Foreign Ministers instructed the representatives to continue discussing these issues and prepare appropriate recommendations. The Potsdam Agreement had the following resolution: that the Foreign Minister conference "will be responsible for preparing a peaceful solution for Germany, which will be accepted by the German government when a German government for peaceful purposes is established." It appears from the decision in Potsdam that the future German government will have the opportunity to state its opinions on the draft treaty before the German treaty is signed. However, during the London conference, the US delegation put forward a suggestion advocating the use of certain "international laws" instead of the German treaty, and deciding the German peace solution without the participation of the German government. The US, UK, and French delegations insisted on replacing "Treaty with Germany" with "German Treaty," while the Soviet Union opposed this wording and solemnly pointed out that the German government should be given the opportunity to state its opinions at the future peace conference. After a long discussion, US representative Murphy agreed to abandon the term "German Treaty" and accept the wording "Treaty with Germany." The preparation procedure for the draft treaty will continue to be discussed at the next meeting.
    [This Newspaper Dispatch] TASS Moscow, March 13th: The Foreign Minister Representatives' meeting discussed the military clauses in the Austrian treaty on the 12th. Because there were two viewpoints on the issue of the number of troops in the army, after a brief discussion, the Foreign Minister Representatives decided to stop the discussion of this issue and turn to discuss the issue of the number of air force bases within Austria. The Soviet representative pointed out that in such a small Austrian territory, there were fifty-four military aviation bases, most of which were built by the Germans, while in 1938, there were only nine air force bases within Austria. Of all the air force bases in Austria, only eighteen have been demilitarized. Obviously, since Austria is only allowed to retain no more than ninety military aircraft, it does not need fifty-four air force bases. Therefore, it is very reasonable to reduce the number of air force bases to make them only sufficient for air force and civil aviation applications. As is well known, the British and American representatives, who hold different opinions from the Soviet representative, expressed great concern about this issue, and they were unwilling to include any clauses related to reducing Austrian air force bases in the draft of the Austrian treaty. The representatives agreed to submit this issue to military experts. The meeting further discussed the Soviet delegation's suggestion that Austrian convoys should only be equipped with weapons manufactured in Austria. This suggestion was rejected by the US, French, and British representatives, who insisted that Austria has the right to use weapons supplied by any country. The representatives did not reach any agreement on this issue.

　　四外长代表举行会议
    讨论对德奥和约问题
    苏代表主张予德人陈述意见机会并限制奥国空军基地与武器装备
    【本报讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：德国问题外长代表会议于三月十二日晨开始讨论对德和约之准备程序。伦敦代表会议之结果，使外长会议获得了四强政府陈述其对决定此程序之报告。伦敦外长代表会议同意对德和约应由苏、美、英、法四国政府草拟。四国外长曾指示各代表继续讨论这些问题，并准备适当之建议。苏方代表维辛斯基建议逐步考虑对德和约准备程序之一切要点，与会者均予同意。波茨顿协定曾有下述决议：即外长会议“将负责准备德国之和平解决方案，此将于和平目的之德国政府成立时，由德国政府予以接受。”由波茨顿之决定看来，德国未来政府在对德和约签字以前，将得机会陈述其对和约草案之意见。然而，当伦敦会议之际，美代表团方面曾发表建议，主张用某些“国际法”代替对德和约，而决定德国和平之解决无需由德国政府参预其间。美、英、法三国代表团坚持以《德国和约》代替《对德和约》，而苏联则反对此种措辞，并严正指出在将来之和平会议中，应予德国政府以陈述其意见之机会。经长久之讨论后，美代表穆菲同意放弃《德国和约》之名词，而接受《对德和约》之措辞。和约草案之准备程序，将在下次会议继续讨论。
    【本报讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：外长代表会议于十二日讨论对奥和约中之军事条款，因陆军之人数问题有两种观点，经简短讨论后，各外长代表即决定停止此问题之讨论，转而讨论奥国境内空军基地之数目问题。苏联代表指出，在如此小的奥国领土上，有五十四个军用航空基地，其中大部为德国人所建，而在一九三八年时，奥国境内则仅有九个空军基地。在奥地利所有的全部空军基地中，只有十八个被解除了武装。很明显的，在奥地利只被允许保留不超过九十架军用飞机以来，它是不需要五十四个空军基地的。因此减少空军基地数目而使其仅够空军及民用航空应用是非常合理的。如所周知，持有与苏联代表不同意见之英美代表们，对此问题表示了极大的关切，举凡一切有关减少奥地利空军基地问题之任何条款，彼等皆不愿列入对奥和约草案，代表们同意将此问题提交军事专家。会议更进而讨论苏联代表团关于奥地利车队只能用奥国所制造之武器装备之建议，此建议遭美法英代表之拒绝，彼等坚持奥国有权使用任何国家所供给之武器，代表们对此问题，未达任何协议。
