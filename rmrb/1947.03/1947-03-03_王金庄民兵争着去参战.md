【Benbao Shexian Xun】During this war participation, the Wangjinzhuang militia in the fourth district of Shexian County all vied to go. Old self-defense team member Wang Liquan also wanted to go, but everyone said he was too old and wouldn't let him. He was very dissatisfied and said, "Everyone has a share in participating in the war, and it can't just be you militiamen going!" Liu Huaishun and Liu Zhongyuan, two brothers, both scrambled to sign up, and their father said with a smile, "If you two are competing to go, I will reward each of you with 1,000 yuan for travel expenses."
