Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: A Moscow dispatch from United Press reports that the newspaper *Izvestia* published a commentary on the 1st stating: "It is now proven that U.S. troops have not withdrawn from China, and it seems that the United States intends to continue its policy towards China. World democratic public opinion has the right to expect the United States to fulfill its own promises consistently in word and deed, especially because the presence of U.S. troops in China has become an important cause of the Chinese civil war." *Izvestia* also pointed out that U.S. Howard news agency reporter Newton recently tried to find excuses for the U.S. military presence in China, spreading rumors that the Soviet Union supplied weapons to the Chinese Communist Party. *Izvestia* stated that when Marshall left China via Hawaii, he claimed that he had no evidence of Soviet aid to the CCP, and Congressman Mansfield, who returned to the United States from China, also said the same thing in Washington on the afternoon of February 23rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: A dispatch from TASS Shanghai on the 23rd reports: "The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Qingdao has been postponed for unknown reasons. Many houses and military camps that U.S. troops had withdrawn from have not been handed over to the Chinese, and are now being repaired again and guarded by U.S. soldiers. In recent days, several ships fully loaded with fuel, vehicles, and munitions have arrived in Tanggu, Tianjin." A report on the 12th from the *Beiping Chronicle*, a newspaper controlled by the Kuomintang Military Bureau, also stated: "According to reliable sources, U.S. troops stationed in China will use 'training the Chinese Navy' as a reason to remain in China for another five years."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: A Moscow dispatch from the Associated Press on the 25th, citing a TASS dispatch from Shanghai, stated: "The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Tanggu has been halted for unknown reasons." It also stated: "New U.S. supplies are arriving, and the military camps they are closing have not been handed over to China, but are still guarded by U.S. troops."

　　美国撤军诺言等于放屁
    华北美军竟不撤退
    军火船只反又开抵塘沽等地
    【新华社延安二日电】合众社莫斯科讯，消息报一日发表评论称：“现已证明美军并未撤离中国，并且似乎是美国打算继续执行其对华政策。世界民主舆论有权期望美国言行一致地履行其自己的诺言，特别是因为美军驻在中国成为中国内战的重要原因。”消息报并指出：美国霍华德系记者牛顿最近图为美军驻华找借口，造谣说苏联的武器供给中国共产党。消息报称：马歇尔在离华经夏威夷时，曾宣称他没有苏联援助中共的证据，旅华返美的众议员孟斯菲德二月二十三日下午在华府也讲了同样的话。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】据塔斯社上海二十三日电称：“青岛美军之撤退已展期，原因不明。美军曾经撤出的许多房屋与军营并未移交中国人，而现在又再事修理，且由美兵守卫。数日来，满载燃料、车辆与军火的若干船只已开达天津塘沽。”国民党军统局御用之北平纪事报十二日消息亦称：据可靠方面消息传称，驻华美军将以“训练中国海军”为理由，在中国尚有五年之驻留。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】据美联社莫斯科二十五日电录引塔斯社上海通讯称：美军自天津、青岛及塘沽的撤退工作，业因不可知的理由停止。又称：美军新供应品正在到来，他们结束的军营尚未移交中国，仍由美军守卫中。
