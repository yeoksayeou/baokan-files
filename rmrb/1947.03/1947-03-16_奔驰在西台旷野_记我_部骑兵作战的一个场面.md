Galloping Across the Western Terrace Wilderness
    A Scene from the Operation of My × Regiment's Cavalry
    ·Xia Chuan·
    After a fierce artillery battle, just at four o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy trapped in the Western Terrace Collection, like the raging water of a breached dam, flowed out in a dark mass from the south寨墙 (zhai qiang - fortified village wall).
    But they immediately encountered the pincer attack of the 78th and 2829th units. Immediately after, our Third Company's white horses, led by Instructor Song Zhen, shouted slogans of "Confiscate weapons and spare lives," "Whoever resists will be killed," and bravely charged into the large group of enemies breaking through.
    The enemy panicked! Upon seeing the cavalry, images of the "White Horse Regiment" and "Black Horse Regiment" and all sorts of magical legends immediately emerged in their minds, growing ugly and terrible shadows of death. In an instant, most of them lost the courage to fight back. The third platoon leader, Xu Liancheng, met the resistance of an officer and immediately repaid him with a sharp blade! As a result, the officers forgot to control their troops, and those holding guns forgot the instinct to load bullets and fire. Their nerves completely lost self-control, and their brains became extremely simple: running, blindly running.
    Comrade Zhang Junren, our excellent combat hero, single-handedly charged back and forth in the enemy's ranks, seizing machine guns whenever he saw them, killing those who didn't surrender! Bullets pierced his cotton coat and cotton trousers, flying around him like zizzing bees. Moreover, appearing so alone as one person drills into the enemy crowd!… He had no time to think about any of this, using his knife to slash and kill, using his newly acquired machine gun to sweep, making groups of enemies afraid to offer any resistance to this lone knight!
    This was no longer a battle formation, but a chaotic mob. As the cavalry charged, some crawled on the ground, some raised their hands, and others were hitting their "luck" while running and fleeing!
    Suddenly, one hears: "Drop your guns and run!"
    "Raise your hands!"
    "Clap your hands!"
    Thus, this group of desperate people dropped their guns, raised their hands, and clapped their hands, running blindly and frantically.
    Not far away, the Fifth Company blocked them off on horseback, and the routed enemy turned south again. The south side was again met with fire resistance, so they turned east again. As a result, the whole group rushed into our annihilation circle!

　　奔驰在西台旷野
    记我×部骑兵作战的一个场面
    ·夏川·
    经过一阵激烈的炮战，刚好下午四点，困守西台集的敌人，像决堤的恶水，黑压压地从南寨墙上流出来。
    但立刻遇到七八部队和二八二九部队的钳击、紧接着我们三连的白马，便在宋桢指导员的率领下，喊着“缴枪不杀”，“谁打杀谁”的口号，高举着雪亮的战刀，勇猛冲进敌人突围的大队。
    敌人慌了！一见骑兵，在脑子里便浮现出“白马团”“黑马团”种种神奇的传说，生长出丑恶可怕的死的阴影，一霎时，大都丧失了还手的勇气；三排长许连成遇到一个军官的抵抗，当即报之以锋利的刀锋！于是当官的忘记了掌握部队，拿枪的忘记了推上子弹射击的本能。他们的神经完全没有了自制力，大脑变得极度单纯；奔跑，盲目的奔跑着。
    战士张俊仁，我们优秀的战斗英雄，匹马单刀，在敌人的队列里往返驰骋，见机枪就夺，不缴枪就杀！子弹穿破了棉袄，穿破了棉裤，在他周围兹兹乱飞；而且，一个人钻进敌人群中，显得是多么孤伶！………这一切，他都无暇思虑，用刀砍杀，用新得的机枪扫射，使成群的敌人，对这一单行的骑士不敢有任何抗拒！
    这已不是战斗的行列，是杂乱的乌合之众，骑兵冲来了，有的爬在地下，有的举起双手，有的则在奔跑逃命中撞自己的“运气！”
    忽而听到：“放下枪跑！”
    “举起手来！”
    “拍手！”
    于是，这一群亡命之徒，便丢下枪，举起手，拍着巴掌盲目惊慌的乱跑起来。
    不远，五连又乘马拦头截住，溃乱的敌人又折向南，南面又遇到火力的阻击，再折向东，结果便整个窜入我们的歼灭圈！
