    Correspondence No. 7
    Comrade Du Zhanchao:
    The experience of Ren Village in Dachuan County in resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses is very good. It is hoped that specific materials will be quickly added on several important points, and a news report will be written and sent: (1) The process of ideological transformation of cadres from unconsciousness to consciousness, the specific ideological situation before and after. (2) The specific process of the masses changing from hating cadres to loving them? The submitted draft only shows the previous hatred and subsequent love, but does not show how hatred was transformed into love. It is hoped that detailed information on the opinions raised during the winter study sessions, the speeches of cadres and the masses at the conference, and ideological activities outside the conference will be supplemented. Even the ideological changes of one or two people would be helpful.
    The ideological review draft of Ren Village reflects the specific thoughts of the masses before and after, but does not describe the specific process of enlightenment and transformation, which is also hoped to be supplemented quickly.

    通讯往来  第七号
    杜展潮同志：
    达县任村解决干群关系的经验很好。望在几个重要关节上迅速补充具体材料，写成新闻通讯发来：（一）干部从不自觉到自觉的思想转变过程，前后思想具体情况。（二）群众对干部由恨到爱的具体过程？来稿只看到前恨后爱，却看不见如何转恨为爱。希将历次冬学提意见与大会的干群发言与会外思想活动等详细情况补充一下。即使是一、二人的思想变化也好。
    任村思想复查稿反映群众前后思想很具体，但没写出觉悟转变的具体过程，也望速作补充。
