    Taihang Post Office Launches Emulation Drive
    Guaranteeing Good Military Postal Service
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 18th] To respond to the "February 7th" editorial of the People's Daily, which proposed a campaign to earn merit, the Taihang Post Office and its trade union convened a joint meeting of union standing committee members and county bureau chiefs on the 7th of this month to discuss launching a campaign among postal cadres and workers to earn merit for the people. The meeting decided that the union and the administration would jointly form a merit evaluation committee; the district bureau union and administration would each select five people to be responsible, and each bureau station union would select one person and the administration one person, and then select one more person to jointly form a merit evaluation team. The proposed standards for earning merit were: that mobile post offices accompanying the army should maintain regular contact between the front and the rear, ensuring that the soldiers at the front receive newspapers and letters as early as possible. The rear must ensure that they receive news as early as possible. Those who achieve results according to the above standards will be evaluated in four grades. Merit evaluation should strictly avoid doing everything on behalf of the masses; the mass line should be followed. Competitions should be launched between bureaus and stations, as well as between individuals, and models should be elected and the movement summarized in the autumn. Everyone at the meeting was in high spirits, saying, "We must earn more merit and strive to be heroes."
