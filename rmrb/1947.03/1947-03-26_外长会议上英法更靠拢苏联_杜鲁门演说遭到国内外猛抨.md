    At Foreign Ministers' Conference, Britain and France Move Closer to the Soviet Union
    Truman's Speech Attacked Domestically and Internationally
    Over the past week, the world's attention has remained focused on Moscow. The second week of the Moscow Conference has ended, and the foreign ministers have moved from a broad exchange of views to a concrete review of the German Control Council's 800-page report. The portion of the report concerning the principles of handling the German economy and reparations was the first to be reviewed, and it remains a very important part of the report, with the Ruhr issue and reparations at its core. Another part of the Control Council's report, namely the handling of Germany politically, was also reviewed at the meeting. The week's meetings showed, as before, that there were two different lines in dealing with this issue; what was different from the past was the formation of a new division between these two lines, which is that France is more clearly aligning itself with the Soviet Union on this issue. The symbol of this is Bidault's important statement on the 18th. Stalin's meeting with Bidault on the 17th was hailed by American journalists as a "major event outside the Moscow Conference." The Franco-Soviet rapprochement that this meeting fostered became a feature of the second week of the Moscow Conference. During the second week, Britain did not take an absolute position on what was called a stalemate. While Bevin disagreed with Molotov on many important points, they agreed on the establishment of central administrative bodies in Germany, industrial development, and the preparation of plans for German financial reform. Marshall, who came to the meeting with a "big stick," did not appear active in the second week. Bevin, while following his lead in some places, was "greatly surprised" and somewhat "frustrated" when he heard him declare that 2,000 enterprises in the American zone of Germany had been designated for dismantling equipment as reparations. The facts of the past twenty-one months have shown that there are two contradictions in dealing with Germany. The first is the divergence between the Soviet Union and the US, British, and French reactionaries on the elimination of German militarism and Nazism and the implementation of German democratization; the second is the struggle between the US and British reactionary monopoly capital over annexing Germany, plundering Germany, and dismembering Germany. Judging from various facts, although the former contradiction is fundamental, the latter contradiction will become more real and more prominent; that is, the distance between the British and American reactionaries will become greater and greater. Because of this relationship, the Moscow Conference will never be guided by Marshall's "big stick"; on the contrary, under the pressure of increasing isolation, Marshall cannot but compromise to a considerable extent. To a certain extent, there is a complete possibility for the four powers to reach an agreement on the German issue.
    Over the past week, American democrats have launched an extremely broad mass movement against Truman's policy of aiding the Greek and Turkish reactionaries. From members of Congress to professional groups, peace groups, women's groups, ethnic groups, and even religious groups, all have been drawn into the movement. Truman's so-called "new policy" is using anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric as a smokescreen to make a show of force at the Moscow Conference and to cheer on Marshall; but his real aim is only for his own "world empire" dream abroad and his "attack on the rights of the people" at home. The American people have seen through this trick, so it has aroused extremely widespread opposition. This opposition movement is so powerful that even Vandenberg, the reactionary leader who directed Truman's policy, had to feign and propose a so-called "amendment" to Congress on the 21st, demanding that aid to Greece and Turkey "conform to the purposes of the United Nations." This is of course nonsense, but in reality, while preparing to pay, the American fleet has already announced a "visit" to Greece and Turkey; various American missions (including military advisory groups) will also swagger to Athens and Ankara. As the American iron claw extends so concretely into Britain's sphere of influence, Britain is of course distressed. When the British House of Commons held an inquiry on the 17th, members asked questions such as "Did the two governments consult before Truman made his statement?" and "Did the government participate in giving opinions?" The British government's statement was extremely "cautious," only objecting to members' mentioning "concern" about American interference in the Near East. "Expressing concern" or "visiting," the heroic Greek people's war of self-defense against foreign occupiers and traitors is unfolding victoriously. The National Liberation Front has united a wider range of allies in the patriotic war. Even Acheson admits that the scale of the war of self-defense and its threat to reactionary rule is pushing Greece to the brink of emergency.

### 外长会议上英法更靠拢苏联  杜鲁门演说遭到国内外猛抨

    外长会议上英法更靠拢苏联
    杜鲁门演说遭到国内外猛抨
    过去一周，全世界的目光仍注视着莫斯科。莫斯科会议的第二周已告结束，各外长已自广泛的交换意见，转入具体的审查德国管委会长达八百页的报告。该报告关于处理德国经济原则与赔偿问题的部分，首先受到审查，还是报告中很重要的部分，这一问题以鲁尔问题与赔偿问题为核心。管委会报告的另一部分，即关于在政治上处理德国的问题，亦在会上受到审查。一周的会议显示和过去一样的，是在处理这一问题时存在两条不同的路线；和过去不一样的，是这两条路线中新的分野的形成，这就是法国在这个问题上比较明确的和苏联的靠拢。其标帜是比道尔十八日的重要声明，斯大林与比道尔十七日的会谈被美国记者誉为“莫斯科会议之外的重大事件”。这一会谈所促成的法苏接近，成为莫斯科会议第二周的特点。会议第二周的英国，对于被称为僵局的部分并未采取绝然态度，贝文固然在很多重要的地方和莫洛托夫意见不同，但在德国中央行政机构、工业发展与德国财政改革计划的准备方面，意见则是一致的。带着“大棒”赴会的马歇尔，在第二周中并不显得活跃。贝文对他固然在有些地方是亦步亦趋，但在听到他宣称德国美占区二千个企业已被指定拆除装备作为赔偿时，则“大为惊讶”，而且有些“沮丧”。二十一个月来的事实表明，在处理德国时存在着两种矛盾，其一是苏联与美、英、法反动派之间关于消除德国军国主义、纳粹主义，实行德国民主化方面之分歧；其二是美、英反动的独占资本之间关于吞并德国、剥夺德国、支解德国方面之争执。由种种事实看来，前一种矛盾虽然是基本的，但后一种矛盾将变得更加现实，更加突出；就是说，英、美反动派之间的距离，将要愈来愈大。因为这种关系，莫斯科会议决不会受马歇尔“大棒”的指导；相反的，马歇尔在日益孤立的压力下，不能不相当妥协。德国问题在一定程度上在四强之间就有获取协议的完全可能。
    过去一周，美国国内民主分子为反对杜鲁门援助希土反动派的政策，掀起了极其广泛的群众运动，自国会议员至职业团体、和平团体、妇女团体、民族团体，甚至宗教团体等都卷入运动中。杜鲁门的所谓“新政策”，本是用反苏反共为烟幕对莫斯科会议虚张声势，为马歇尔助威；但他真正目的只是为了它自己在国外的“世界帝国”迷梦，以及在国内的“进攻人民权”。美国人民识破了这种诡计，所以引起了极其广泛的反对。这个反对运动十分有力，以至导演杜鲁门政策的反动派头子登堡，也不得不于二十一日装腔作势的向国会提出什么“修正法案”，要求援助希土“符合联合国之宗旨”。这当然是鬼话，实际上是一面准备付款，另一面美国舰队就已经宣布“访问”希、土；美国的各种使团（包括军事顾问团），也将大模大样的开往雅典、安哥拉了。美国这只铁爪这样实实在在的伸到英国的势力范围内，英国当然苦恼了。英下院十七日举行质询时，议员们曾纷纷提出“两国政府在杜鲁门发表声明前是否会商”及“政府有否参加意见”等问题。英政府之发言则极为“谨慎”，仅反对议员们言及美国插足近东一事“表示关切”。“表示关切”也罢，“访问”也罢，英勇的希腊人民反对外国占领者与卖国贼的自卫战争，正在胜利展开中。民族解放阵线在爱国战争中，已结合了更广泛的同盟。自卫战争的规模和它对反动统治的威胁，连亚泽逊也承认：希腊情况已濒迫急之境。
