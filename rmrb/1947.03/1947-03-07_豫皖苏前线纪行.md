　　A Journey to the Front Lines of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu
             Great Strides Forward
    On the third day after the Spring Festival, this reporter accompanied the People's Liberation Army to the front lines of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu amidst wind and snow. Along the way, military vehicles rumbled and warhorses neighed as the People's Liberation Army counterattacked the Zhecheng and Suixian areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. In the villages we passed, people wearing bright red and green New Year's clothes came out to greet us, cheering, "Where did so many Eighth Route Armymen come from? These are all veteran Eighth Route Army soldiers!" When we passed Zhu Archway, Aunt Kong, the landlady, took out two jujube and bean buns and warmly stuffed them into Staff Officer Wang's arms: "Brother, don't be polite, you're not an outsider." Staff Officer Wang sincerely accepted them.
    On the moonlit and frosty night, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the fortresses lining the Longhai Railway fled in a panic at the sound of the train's roar. The "Tiger Squad" of the puppet township government, who didn't have time to escape, were all captured by a few of our scouts. The people in Chiang Kai-shek's distant rear were spreading rumors: "The divine Eighth Route Army has arrived, Chiang Kai-shek is finished!" (January 25th)
             Reining in the Horses at Dawn
    While resting at Leima (a market town), our guide told us that a battalion of Chiang's "Henan Security Regiment" had been in the village until noon. At midnight, as we approached a few miles from Leima, the warhorses neighed a few times. The Chiang troops, with their long ears, heard it and, fearing annihilation, ran away without even saddling their horses. The morning in Leima was an extremely lively scene. Men and women were all busily searching for their belongings in the Chiang troops' fortifications, pulling tree branches and dismantling door panels. The bunkers around the village were quickly torn down. Our army was stationed in Leima. At the headquarters of a certain unit, the common people freely went in to find their belongings, even searching the commander's room. A certain commander smiled and said to the villagers, "Come in, see if that's your stuff. We're leaving, so you can take it back." Several sixteen or seventeen-year-old girls also ran to find things, not afraid of the Eighth Route Army at all. An old woman on South Street said to me, "There are more people on the street than during the New Year! When Chiang's army was stationed here during the New Year, who dared to come out?! We didn't even dare to celebrate the New Year!" (January 28th)
            Encampment at Guanzhuang
    After recovering Zhecheng, the People's Liberation Army marched eastward. That night, after a sixty-mile forced march, we arrived at Guanzhuang, thirty miles west of Bozhou in Anhui Province, at cockcrow and moonset.
    We shouted until our throats were hoarse, but no one opened the door. It wasn't that the common people were stubborn, but that Chiang Kai-shek's bloody rule had taught them too deep a lesson. We entered the courtyard, and in the north room, a three-year-old child was lying on the bed, crying like a slaughtered pig. The quilt on the bed was still warm, and there was an earthen cave under the bed. The landlord had run away into the cave and couldn't be called out. The signalman lit some firewood, prepared a cup of milk, put cotton pants on the child, and the chief of staff took out biscuits from his pocket and fed the child in his arms.
    After a while, the child's grandmother came out, trembling. Seeing our friendly attitude towards her, she felt relieved and repeatedly called out "Old General," praising us incessantly. After about half an hour, the old woman boiled water, took out sugar and peanuts, and offered them to us, but no one ate them. Only then did she realize that we were not Chiang's army. The chief of staff told her that we were the Eighth Route Army. She repeatedly shouted to her daughter-in-law and daughters who were hiding in the cave: "Come out, girls, the Eighth Route Army Old Generals have come, not the 'calamity army'."
    The old woman told me that her family had been robbed twice by the "calamity army" last year, and they even dragged her daughter away and slept with her for a night. The old woman was so frightened that ever since then, whenever someone knocked on the door at night, the whole family would hide in the cave like mice. (February 1st)
            The Nunnery at Bali Temple
    Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, incense burning at the nunnery in Bali Temple, northwest of Bozhou, has been incessant. When this reporter stepped into the nunnery, Master Wang and Master Gao were kneeling before the gods, chanting and praying: "I am sixty years old this year and have never seen such a good army. They treat us like family. Buddha, please bless the Eighth Route Army to win battles and change the land into the Eighth Route Army's territory so that I can offer you good incense." The several masters of the nunnery have been constantly asking our comrades to sew clothes and cook meals for them for the past few days. (February 2nd)
            Reflections on the Mulan Shrine
    In the afternoon, with great excitement, I went to pay homage to the shrine of the ancient (reporter's note: according to legend, Hua Mulan was from Bozhou City during the Northern Wei Dynasty) national heroine Hua Mulan. I heard that there was a bronze statue of her there. When I walked to the southwest corner of the city, an old man told me: "Don't go, there's nothing there. The Mulan statue was destroyed by the Central Army long ago." This dampened my excitement by half. I still climbed the city wall and followed the enemy's dug trenches to the Mulan Shrine in the southwest corner of the city. It was an extremely dilapidated tile-roofed house with two bunkers in front. There was indeed no bronze statue of Hua Mulan here, only blood-stained green military uniforms and unexploded grenades. Below the city were endless wild graves, and the cold wind was desolate. Filled with emotion, the reporter recalled the scene of this patriotic girl joining the army, as sung in the "Ballad of Mulan" that I read as a child: "I didn't hear the sound of my parents calling their daughter, but only the sound of the Yellow River flowing swiftly. I left the Yellow River in the morning and spent the night at the Blackwater River. I didn't hear the sound of my parents calling their daughter, but only the sound of the barbarian cavalry from Yanshan chirping." Today, the Mulan Shrine is only a place for lamentation. (February 3rd)
            The Boiling Wo River
    "A year of hardship, all donated in March." This is a couplet on the gate of a family outside the East Gate of Bozhou. From this, it is not difficult to imagine the suffering of the people of Bozhou under Chiang's rule. In order to visit this famous "Little Nanjing" (i.e., Bozhou), I strolled to the banks of the Wo River in the morning. Here, two enemy warehouses had been opened. Countless people were carrying baskets and sacks to move grain. The crowd was so dense that the Wo River Bridge was almost broken. A ragged child named Li Wendou was panting with exhaustion, his forehead covered in sweat. He murmured to me: "I didn't even eat white flour during the New Year. Since the Eighth Route Army came, we poor people have something to eat. Are you still going?" An old woman surnamed Wang from Ximenli also came to move grain. She cursed with hatred: "Have you caught that fat grandson (reporter's note: referring to Hu Zhiyuan, the Chiang-appointed magistrate of Boxian County)? He scared us so much that we shivered whenever he came out...." She also eagerly hoped: "I heard that the Eighth Route Army is distributing land equally (referring to 'land to the tillers'). The land in our Bozhou all belongs to the eight big families (the Jiang, Gao, Wang, Zhao, etc., eight big landlords)...." As she spoke, many people gathered around. From this, it is not difficult to imagine how urgent the poor people's demands for land are!
    The people carrying grain smiled in the warm sun; the Communist Party was just like the winter sun to them.
    Standing on the boiling Wo River, witnessing these boiling masses, I silently sang for these liberated people:
    The cold winter that ravaged the flowers and trees has passed, and Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule that harmed the people is coming to an end! The spring breeze blows, melting the ice and snow. The Communist Party has come, saving the people of this land. A riot of color, that is spring! The savior of the people, that is Mao Zedong! (February 4th)
            The Bozhou Battlefield After Victory
    In the morning, I crossed the Wo River and arrived at Dadingzhuang and Zhangdazhuang, the battlefields where the 15th Brigade of Chiang's 75th Division was annihilated. They were all the same, with no trees or good houses left. Chiang's troops buried themselves in their own trenches. In Dadingzhuang, which had less than twenty households, there were about two hundred dead warhorses lying there. One enemy corpse's helmet had seven holes in it. More than a dozen trucks were destroyed, and rice was everywhere. It is conceivable how fierce the artillery fire was at the time. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are now carrying rice, meat, and checking their supplies, food, and weapons. Many common people also came to help them clean up the battlefield.
    This Bozhou battlefield after the victory, with patches of blood, crisscrossing corpses, red brick walls, and billowing smoke, is truly "Thirty miles north of Bozhou, corpses of horses trampled across; the Wo River waters splatter, blood soaks the fertile soil." Everyone knows that this tragic scene was created by the fascist culprit Chiang Kai-shek. (February 5th)
            Even in Death, They Can't Forget the Eighth Route Army
    We stayed at Baomiao, five miles east of Suixian County. The landlord's son, Guo Guangzhi, was sick in bed.
    In the morning, the meal was rice and two meat dishes; the old woman's eyes were watching us. When we heard the old woman eating, she said: "Brother, my son is very sick, he wants to eat some rice, but we can't afford it." Director Miao, after hearing this, immediately served a bowl of rice and gave her all the dishes as well. The hot rice and delicious dishes were immediately eaten by the patient, who hadn't eaten properly for several days. Then, he also said with strength to the old woman: "Mother, let me see what the Eighth Route Army looks like!" This man with a sallow complexion and sunken eyes looked at Comrade Chen and said: "Brother, even if I die, I will never forget your Eighth Route Army!" Director Miao also served a bowl of rice to Guo Guangzhi's child, Yongfu, and fed him in the sun. Guo Guangzhi said: "Little Fu, look how good your Eighth Route Army uncle is, hurry up and grow up and follow the Eighth Route Army uncle." This smart child, Xiao Fu, also smiled at the director, half-swallowing, half-speaking: "Join the Eighth Route Army...." At night, the old woman burned incense and made a wish: "God, quickly change to the Eighth Route Army's territory. If we change to the Eighth Route Army's territory, we will have a good life, and my illness will be cured!" (February 11th)
            A Girl Who Firmly Joins the Eighth Route Army
    When passing through Ling Village in Suixian County, an old woman told me this tragic and heroic story.
    Not long ago, the Chiang puppet "Security Regiment" stationed a running dog of Chiang Kai-shek with a ferocious face here. The daughter of the honest farmer Wang Lao was raped by him in front of Wang Lao. Wang Lao, this honest farmer, couldn't bear it and cursed while pulling his daughter. This Chiang soldier shot and killed old Wang Lao. There were only the father and daughter in his family. After Wang Lao was killed by the Chiang army, his daughter packed up the things in the house and said to the people in the village: "I want to join the Eighth Route Army!" (February 15th)

### 豫皖苏前线纪行
勇进

　　豫皖苏前线纪行
             大踏步前进
    春节后的第三天，记者随人民解放军在风雪交加中进抵豫皖苏前线。路上兵车辚辚，战马萧萧，人民解放军向豫皖苏柘城、睢县地区反击。我们经过的村庄，人们穿着红红绿绿的新年衣服，都走出来迎接。欢呼着：“那里来的这样多的八路军？这都是老八路呀！”路过朱牌坊时，房东孔大娘拿出两个枣豆包，亲热地塞到王参谋怀里：“您大哥，别客气，这可不是外人。”王参谋诚恳地接受了。
    在月冷霜白的夜里，陇海路侧林立的堡垒中的蒋军听见火车吼声，就一溜烟逃跑了。来不及跑的伪乡公所“老虎队”，我们去几个侦察员就都擒来了。蒋介石远后方的老百姓风传着：“神八路来了，老蒋不行了！”（一月二十五日）
             勒马的早晨
    勒马（一个集镇）休息时，向导告诉我们，这村中午还有蒋军“河南保安团”一个营。半夜，我们走近离勒马几里路的地方，战马叫了几声，耳朵长的蒋军一听见，怕被歼灭，马没有上鞍子就窜跑了。勒马的早晨，是一个极其热闹的场面。男的、女的，都匆忙地在蒋军工事里找自己的东西。拉树枝，拆门板，村子周围的碉堡很快就拆完了。我军在勒马驻下了。在某部司令部，老百姓随便进去找自己的东西，一直找到司令员住室，某司令笑着对老乡说：“你们进来吧，看那是您的东西，我们走了您好拿回去。”几个十六七岁的姑娘也跑去找东西，对八路军毫不害怕。南大街一个老大娘对我说：“街上比过新年的时候人多多啦！过年时，老蒋军队住在这里，谁敢出来！？连年也不敢拜呀！”（一月二十八日）
            官庄宿营
    柘城收复后，人民解放军就挥戈东向。这天夜里，六十里急行军，鸡鸣月落方抵安徽境亳州西三十里官庄宿营。
    喊门把噪子喊哑也不开。这不是老百姓顽固，是蒋介石的血腥统治对他们的教训太深了。我们进了院子，北屋里床上躺着一个三岁孩子，杀猪样的啼哭。上床被子还热呼呼的，床下有个土洞，房东从洞里跑掉了，喊也喊不出来。通讯员点着木柴，座上一杯牛奶，替小孩穿上棉裤，参谋长从口袋里摸出饼干，把小孩子抱在自己的怀里喂。
    一会，这个孩子的祖母颤抖着走来了。见我们对她态度和睦，她才放下心来，连声“老总”“老总”，称赞不绝。约莫半个钟头，老太太烧好了开水，拿出糖和花生要我们吃，但谁都不吃，她这才明白我们不是老蒋军队，参谋长告诉她，我们是八路军。她连声喊洞里藏着的媳妇和姑娘：“出来吧，妞，八路老总来了，不是‘遭殃军’。”
    老太太告诉我，去年他家被“遭殃军”抢了两次，还把她姑娘拉去睡了一夜。老太太可吓坏了，从这以后，夜里一有人敲门，全家人就吓得老鼠一样的钻到洞里去。（二月一日）
            八里庙的尼姑庵
    亳州西北八里庙的尼姑庵，自八路军来后，烧香的络绎不绝。当记者踏进尼姑庵时，庵里的王师傅、高师傅正跪在神前，一面敲木鱼，一面慢慢地祈祷：“我今年六十了，没有见过这样好的队伍，对俺们和一家人一样。老佛爷，你保佑八路军打胜仗，把地面换成八路军的，我好给你上好香。”尼姑庵的几个师傅，几天来不断的找我们同志给缝衣服、作饭。（二月二日）
            木兰祠观感
    下午，我怀着极其兴奋的心情，去瞻仰古代（记者按：据传花木兰系北魏时亳州城里人）民族女英雄花木兰的祠堂。听说那里有她的铜像。当我步行到城西南隅的时候，一个老百姓告诉我：“你不要去了，那里什么也没有，木兰像早就被中央军毁了。”这把我兴奋的心情消减了一半。我毕竟登上了城墙，沿着敌人挖的交通沟倪到西南城角的木兰祠。这是一座极其破落的瓦房，前面有两个碉堡，这里真没有花木兰的铜像，只有血污的绿军装和没打响的手榴弹。城下则是无际野墓，阴风凄凄，不胜荒凉。记者感慨之余，回味起孩子时所读的《木兰辞》上所歌颂的这位爱国女郎参军的情景：“不闻爷娘唤女声，但闻黄河流水声溅溅。旦辞黄河去，暮宿黑水头，不闻爷娘唤女声，但闻燕山胡骑声啾啾。”如今的木兰祠也只有令人悲吊而已。（二月三日）
            沸腾的涡河
    “一年苦中苦，三月都捐完。”这是亳州东关外一家大门上的对联。由此，不难想到亳州人民被蒋军统治时的痛苦。为了参观这个著名的“小南京”（即亳州），上午我漫步至涡河畔，这里，有两个敌人的仓库被打开了。无数的人，正拿着篮子口袋来搬粮食，人挤得涡河桥快压断了。一个穿得十分破烂的孩子李文斗，累得气喘，满头是汗珠。他喃喃的告诉我：“过年就没吃上白面。八路军来了一天，俺穷人就有啥吃了。您还走不？”西门里一个王姓的老太太也是来搬粮食，她恨恨的骂着：“那个胖龟孙（记者按：系指蒋记亳县县长胡志远）您捉住了没有？他一出来就吓得我们打哆嗦……。”她又热切盼望地说：“听说八路那里均地啦（指耕者有其田），俺亳州的地都是八大家的（蒋、高、王、赵等八家大地主），……。”当她谈到这里的时候，不少的人围拢来了。从这里也不难想到穷人们对土地的要求是如何的迫切啊！
    扛粮食的人们在暖和的太阳下展开了笑脸；共产党对于他们，也就正像冬天的太阳。
    我站在沸腾的涡河畔，目击这些沸腾的群众，默默的为这解放了的人们歌唱：
    摧残花木的寒冬过去了，残害人民的蒋介石独裁统治快要完蛋了！春风吹来，融化了冰雪，共产党来了，救了这一方的老百姓。千紫万红啊，是春天！人民的救星啊，是毛泽东！（二月四日）
            胜利后的亳北战场
    上午，我踏过了涡河到了歼灭蒋军第七十五师第十五旅的战场丁大庄、张大庄，都是一样，没有树木，也没有一座好的房子了，蒋军在自己的战壕里把自己埋葬了。不到二十户的丁大庄，有二百来匹死了的战马躺着，一个敌尸的钢盔上就有七个眼子，十几辆大卡车被打坏了，大米满地都是，可想当时炮火是如何激烈了。人民解放军的战士们，现在在这里有的扛米，有的扛肉，有的检查自己的用品、食物和武器。不少老百姓也来和他们一起打扫战场。
    这个胜利后的亳北战场，片片的血泊，纵横的尸体，红红的墙砖，滚滚的烽烟，真是“亳州北卅里，马踏尸体横；溅溅涡河水，血浸泥土肥。”谁都知道，这个惨酷的场面，是法西斯罪魁蒋介石造成的。（二月五日）
            死了也忘不了八路军
    住在睢县东五里保庙，房东的儿子郭广志病在床上。
    早晨，饭是大米和两个肉菜；老太太的眼睛看望着我们，当我们听老太太吃饭时，她才说：“您大哥，俺儿病的很厉害，想吃点大米，也买不起。”苗主任听到后，马上盛了一碗大米饭，把全部菜也都送给她。热腾腾的饭和好滋味的菜，这个好几天没下饭的病人一下就吃完了。然后，也用力的给老大娘说：“娘呀，让我看八路军是啥样的呀！”这个面黄如土眼睛已凹下的人望着陈同志说：“大哥，我死了也忘不了您八路军呀！”苗主任另外也给郭广志的孩子永福盛了一碗大米饭，在太阳下喂着他。郭广志说：“小福，你看您八路大爷多好呀，赶快长大跟八路大爷走吧。”小福这个聪明的孩子也望着主任笑，嘴里半吞半吐的说：“当八路……。”夜里，大娘又烧香许愿：“老天爷，赶快换成八路地面吧，换了八路地面，俺就有日子过啦，俺的病就好啦！”（二月十一日）
            一个坚决参加八路军的姑娘
    路过睢县领村的时候，一个老太太给我讲了这个悲痛壮烈的故事。
    不久以前，蒋伪“保安团”在这里安置了一个带着狰狞面孔的蒋介石的走卒，老汉王劳的姑娘被他当着王劳的面强奸了。王劳这个老实的农民也忍不住，就一面骂着，一面拉着他的姑娘。这个蒋军一枪把老王劳打死。他家里就是父女两人，王劳被蒋军打死后，他的女儿收拾了家里的东西，对村子里的人说：“我要去当八路军去！”（二月十五日）
