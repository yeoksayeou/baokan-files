    Stable Factory Cultivates Skilled Workers
    Returns Home as Technician, Teaching the Whole Family
    [This newspaper, Zuoquan News] The hundred-day textile movement in Majiu Village has rapidly unfolded. When textile production was first launched last year, not a single woman knew how to spin. Now, more than sixty people can spin, and many farming families now have everyone who can spin. They stipulated that yarn be collected and threads delivered every seven days. Each time the threads were handed in, technicians led everyone to study who spun the thread well and how to spin well; who spun third-class thread, and how to spin well. While studying, experiments were carried out in the factory established in the village. In this way, the spinning women's skills gradually improved. At the same time, everyone was told how to take care of the spinning wheels. For example, Zhao Fengxian learned after going to the factory for only a few days. She bought a spinning wheel herself and spun at home. In less than a month, her mother and grandmother learned, and she taught her entire family. Hao Ailan, an eleven-year-old girl, could spin four to six liang of first-class thread every day in less than a month in the factory. Wang Sidan, the women's association secretary, had become a full-fledged worker after seventy days in the factory and could serve as a technician. Six of the eight women organized last year are now technicians. The factory only teaches weaving and novices who don't know how to spin at all. Those who have learned go home to be technicians, teaching their own families and neighbors. Now, textile production has become a craze in the whole village. Some people bought their own cotton to spin, while others borrowed cotton from factories in the city to spin (borrow one jin and ten liang of cotton and return one jin of yarn). This solved the capital difficulty and also learned textile production. Now, women who can spin in the whole village account for one-third of the women in the village, and can spin more than thirty jin of cotton and weave more than twenty-one zhang of cloth every seven days. Women in the whole village who cannot spin are all vying to go to the factory to learn. (Cui Hong)

    马厩纺织厂培养能手
    回去当技师教会全家
    【本报左权讯】马厩村的百日纺织运动已迅速展开。去年发动纺织时还没有一个妇女会纺，现在已有六十多人会纺了，许多农家并已全家会纺。她们规定七天领一次花交一次线，每次交线时由技师领导大家研究看谁纺的线好，怎样纺好的；谁纺的是三等线，怎样就能纺好。一面研究，一面在本村成立的工厂实验，这样纺妇的技术就渐渐提高了。同时又把收拾纺车的办法告诉大家，如赵风先去工厂不几天就学会了。她自己已买了一架纺车回家纺，不到一个月，她娘她姥姥都学会了，她一人教会了全家。郝爱兰是个十一岁的女孩，进工厂不到一个月每天能纺四两到六两，还是头等线。王四旦是妇救会秘书，去工厂七十天已学成了全手，能当技师。去年组织的八个妇女现已有六个当了技师，工厂里只教织布和根本不会纺花的新手，已经学会的回家当技师，教自己家和邻家，现在全村纺织已成热潮。有的自己买了花纺，有的到城里工厂贷了花纺（贷一斤十两花交一斤纱），这样解决了资本困难，也学会了纺织。现在全村会纺织的妇女占全村妇女三分之一，每七天能纺三十多斤花，织二十一丈多布。全村不会纺织的妇女都争着要到工厂学习。（崔鸿）
