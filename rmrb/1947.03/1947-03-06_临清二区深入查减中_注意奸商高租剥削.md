　　【Benbu Jinan 4 Ri Dian】The Linqing Second District has adopted the following methods in this land reduction campaign: First, in "blank villages," cadres first conduct individual interviews, then use winter schools to conduct turning-over education for the masses, and discover and cultivate activists, who then mobilize the masses. Second, in villages that have undergone struggle, a review is conducted to thoroughly liquidate the landlords' scattered land. On the one hand, the masses are mobilized to report the landlords' scattered land they are cultivating; on the other hand, mass organizations are mobilized to investigate the landlords' scattered land. After clearing the land, it is discussed by the masses and handed over to the Farmers' Association for unified management and distribution. Zhu Village cleared out 234 mu of land. Third, in villages near cities, the feudal exploitation of peasants by merchants is also liquidated. For example, major treacherous merchants in Linqing, such as Fude and Deju, purchased land from the masses at low prices during famine periods, and then extracted the masses' blood and sweat through feudal exploitation methods such as renting, leasing, and mortgaging, and relied on enemy and puppet forces to transfer public grain, expenses, and black levies to the masses. In Nanshuiguan, 58 impoverished peasant households with 174 people only had 56 mu of land, averaging 0.32 mu per person. The land was occupied by several large treacherous merchants in the city. The movement also paid attention to resolving outstanding issues. For example, much of the land recovered from past struggles was still occupied by various organizations (workers, farmers, youth, women) and should be redistributed to the peasants. Furthermore, land adjustments between rich and poor villages were organized to ensure that poor peasants obtained sufficient land.

　　临清二区深入查减中
    注意奸商高租剥削
    【本报冀南四日电】临清二区此次查减，系采取了以下几种作法：第一、在“空白村”干部先进行个别访问，然后经过群众冬学，进行翻身教育，并发现与培养积极分子，通过他们去串连群众。第二、在斗争过的村庄进行复查，彻底清算地主的疏散土地。一面动员群众自报所种地主的疏散土地，一面通过各群众组织，发动其会员调查地主的疏散土地，清出后经群众讨论，交农会统一处理与分配。朱庄一村即清出二百三十四亩地。第三、在城市附近村庄，并清算了封建性商人对农民的剥削，如临清福德、德巨等大奸商，曾于灾荒期以贱价收买群众土地然后又以出租、出佃、出当等封建剥削方式榨取群众血汗，并仗敌伪势力，将公粮、花销、黑差等转嫁于群众身上。南水关赤贫农五十八户，一百七十四人，只有地五十六亩，每人平均零点三二亩，土地为城市几家大奸商占去。运动中并注意解决了遗留问题，如过去斗争收回的土地，尚有很多为各组织占种（工、农、青、妇）应重新分给农民，并组织了贫富村的土地调剂，以保证贫苦农民分得足够的土地。
