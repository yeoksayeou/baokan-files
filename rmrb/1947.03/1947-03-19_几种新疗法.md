　　Several New Therapies
    Gastric ulcer is a stubborn chronic disease that is difficult to treat. Many people suffer from it and experience great pain. Recent experience has shown that if patients take large amounts of amino acids daily, the acidity in the stomach is greatly reduced, ulcers gradually scar over, and the patient's appetite increases, with very good results.
    Surgical patients often develop blood clots in severed blood vessels after surgery, which can be dangerous. If patients take or are injected with Diemnrtol (a type of tasteless and odorless powder), blood clotting can be prevented.
    Herpes zoster, commonly known as snake rash or "缠龙" (entwining dragon) by the people, is a stubborn and difficult disease to treat. Recent experience shows that injecting patients with procaine can inhibit the progression of lesions in the nerve ganglia or nerve fiber bundles.
    We often see people suffering from persistent migraines. Recently, the use of dihydroergotamine (abbreviated as D.H.E. 5) has shown excellent results.
    Young people often develop blackheads on their faces, which we call "面麻" (facial hemp). In the past, applying ointments to this condition had no effect. Recently, "活络菌素" (Huoluo Junsu - invigorating bacterium element) (produced by the Environmental Sanitation Company) has been invented. Giving patients two to four tablets each time (on an empty stomach) can cure it.

　　几种新疗法
    胃溃疡是难治的顽固慢性疾病，患这病的不少，痛苦很大。最近经验，如属患者每天服用大量氨基酸，则胃内酸度大减，溃疡处渐结瘢痕，病人食欲增加，效果很好。
    外科病人做手术后，往往使切断的血管，形成血栓，致使病人发生危险，如果病人内服要注射Ｄiemnrtol（是一类无味无臭的粉末），就可防止凝血。
    带状泡疹，老百姓叫蛇行疹或缠龙，这病顽固难治。最近经验，给病人注射普罗卡因，可以阻止神经节或神经纤维束上病变的进行。
    我们经常见到有人患顽固的偏头痛，最近是使用双水麦角素（简称Ｄ、Ｈ、Ｅ、５），效果殊佳。
    青年人长了一脸黑点，我们叫面麻。过去对此病涂药膏，毫无效果，最近发明活络菌素（环卫公司出品），每次给病人服二片到四片（空肚服）就可治好。
