　　[This was] reported from the Taiyue [Military District] on the 7th of this month: After the land was returned to the farmers in the Second District of Qinshui, the farmers were overjoyed at the celebration meeting on February 9th, and asked to start their own businesses and get rich. Some even suggested comparing themselves to Wu Manyou. Wang Sanguan, a labor hero from Longquan Village, set out his plan: 1. Immediately rectify the mutual aid team and organize 100% of the male and female labor and semi-labor forces. 2. Organize all the women in the village to spin and weave, and strive to ensure that every household has enough clothes this year. 3. As spring ploughing is approaching, organize everyone to prepare firewood and charcoal for the whole year and to deliver manure. Wang Tianyin, a rich peasant who started his business through labor, said: "I have more than 80 mu of land and four oxen, and I still have to work hard to compare myself with Wu Manyou." Xi Jincai, a 15-year-old hired worker, also said: "I have been emancipated this year and I will work hard to ensure active support for the front, make strong military shoes, defeat Chiang Kai-shek and defend our fruits."

    【本报太岳七日电】沁源二区土地回家后，在二月九日庆祝会上，农民欢喜若狂，要求兴家立业发财致富，更有些人提出来和吴满有比一比。龙泉村劳动英雄王三管，订出了他的计划：一、即刻整顿互助大队，要将男女劳力、半劳力百分之百的组织起来。二、组织全村妇女纺织，今年要做到家家穿衣自给。三、春耕将到，组织大家准备全年柴炭和送粪。劳动起家的富农王天银说：“我有八十多亩地四只牛，还要好好闹，和吴满有比一比。”十五年的老雇工席金财也说：“我今年翻了身要好好劳动保证支差积极军鞋做的结实，打败蒋介石保卫我们的果实。”
