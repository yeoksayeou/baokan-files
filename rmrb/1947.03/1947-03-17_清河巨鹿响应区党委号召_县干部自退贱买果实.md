[Jinan News, Hebei Province, 15th] In order to thoroughly achieve leveling and equalization, county-level cadres in Qinghe and Julu counties have consciously returned ill-gotten gains from cheap purchases of fruits. After studying the area Party committee’s call to "return ill-gotten gains from cheap purchases of fruits," all cadres in Qinghe county-level agencies who had cheaply purchased fruits conducted in-depth ideological self-examination. Li, a section chief of the Public Security Bureau, bought land and other fruits during the mass movement. He said to everyone, "The mistake has already been made. This is my shame, and I will definitely return everything completely." In total, the various agencies bought ten mu of land, one residence, and other items, all of which were voluntarily returned. After the news spread, it was deeply supported by the masses. Nearby people said, "This is truly the people's government! Old Jiang's government could never do this in a million lifetimes!" In order to promote the active participation of cadres and activists in returning excess or embezzled fruits, the Julu County Party Committee took the lead and has completely returned ill-gotten gains from cheap purchases of fruits. Some items that were damaged and could not be returned were compensated to the masses at the original price. The county Party committee has instructed all county cadres to conduct ideological self-examination and return all fruits cheaply purchased from the masses or compensate them at the original price.

[Jinan News, Hebei Province, 15th] After village cadres and activists in villages such as Liutongzhuang in Longping returned excess fruits, the peasants were truly mobilized. After the rent reduction in Liutongzhuang, the masses became disheartened. After in-depth investigation by area cadres, it was learned that Yang Xiaoqing, the director of the peasant association, was covering up for the landlord Cao Yinshan and persuading the masses to move less of his things, and had also borrowed 10,000 yuan from the landlord Cao Xiaoshen. Instructor Cao Wenxing also embezzled fruits, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. After understanding the situation, a mass meeting was immediately convened. The masses raised many opinions to the village cadres. Cao Wenxing and others all confessed their mistakes to the masses at the meeting, returned the embezzled fruits, and expressed that they would work hard in production and abide by the association's regulations in the future. After the meeting, the masses said with satisfaction, "This is truly practicing democracy." After the masses in Xipan Village distributed the fruits, their morale was still low. No one went to the meetings, and the village cadres complained that the masses were backward. After in-depth investigation by the area cadres, it was found that the director of the peasant association and the militia captain, among others, had embezzled fruits. The village cadres were immediately educated. The village cadres became aware of their mistakes and confessed at the mass meeting. The masses shouted, "Welcome to confess!" Militia captain Wang Xiaogui's confession was not thorough enough, and the masses removed him from his position as captain. After the handling, the morale of the masses soared.

    【本报冀南十五日电】隆平刘通庄等村干积极分子，退出多得果实后，农民才真正发动起来。刘通庄查减后，群众消沉，经区干深入检查，得知农会主任杨小庆，替地主曹银山打掩护劝说群众少搬他的东西，并向地主曹小申借了一万元。指导员曹文兴也贪污果实，引起群众不满。了解情况后，即召开群众会，群众向村干提出很多意见，曹文兴等均在大会上向群众坦白认错，退回贪污果实，并表示今后要努力生产，服从会章。会后群众都满意的说：“这才算真实行了民主。”西潘村群众在分了果实后，情绪仍低落，开会没人去，村干部埋怨群众落后，经区干深入检查，发现农会主任和民兵队长等，都贪污了果实，当即对村干进行教育，村干部觉悟，在群众会上坦白认错，群众高呼“欢迎坦白！”民兵队长王小贵坦白不够，群众撤其队长职，处理后群众情绪高涨。
