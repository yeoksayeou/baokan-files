Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 14th: Comrade Wu Yuzhang, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party in Chongqing, the staff of the CCP Liaison Office in Chongqing, and all the staff of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily were forced to withdraw from Chongqing and return to Yan'an on the 9th. This reporter made a special visit to inquire about their experience of being searched and detained by a large number of military police in Chongqing, and being forced to withdraw. Except for the situation of the Xinhua Daily being surrounded, monitored and searched, which has been slightly published, regarding the monitoring and searching of the Chongqing Liaison Office, it is said:

At three o'clock in the deep night of February 27th, more than a hundred military police suddenly and violently knocked on the door of No. 23 Zengjiayan, the CCP Liaison Office in Chongqing. The comrades were awakened from their sleep, opened the door, and dozens of armed military police and some plainclothes secret agents swarmed in and searched everywhere, overturning boxes and cabinets, and scattering clothes and books all over the room. Finally, they swarmed into Comrade Wu Yuzhang's room. Comrade Yuzhang got up quickly, dressed, and asked what was happening. They claimed: "In order to 'protect' your safety, we want you to withdraw." When asked if they had official business, Yang Shuping, the director of the Kuomintang Garrison Headquarters, said, "Yes." Comrade Yuzhang opened a letter from Sun Yuanliang of the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters and saw that it said, "In order to protect the safety of the CCP personnel in Chongqing and maintain local public security, the CCP personnel must withdraw by March 5th," etc. Comrade Yuzhang immediately stated to Yang: "The CCP Liaison Offices in Nanjing, Shanghai and Chongqing were allowed to be established by the government. We cannot withdraw without a government order or an order from our Party. We must stick to our posts and cannot withdraw." A plainclothes secret agent next to him said: "You are undermining peace talks, starting rebellions, and making enemies of the people, causing the people to be unable to live in peace. The masses are very indignant," etc. Comrade Yuzhang immediately retorted: "Who is making enemies of the people? Who is actively fighting the civil war? Who is making the people's lives uneasy? Opposite where we live is an arsenal, which has been rushing to manufacture munitions day and night for several months; conscription and grain requisition are as urgent as fire; transportation is entirely for military use; everything is in a state of war. Who wants to fight a civil war, isn't it clear?" Comrade Yuzhang's voice and expression were stern, so that the other party had to say: "I can't explain it to you clearly." Yang then said: "Please finish reading the official document, I'm afraid you can't see the mimeographed version clearly, here is a version written in ink. Below it also says that the commander is willing to provide transportation and send troops to 'escort' you back to Yan'an, etc. Please don't worry." Comrade Yuzhang said: "You have already messed up everything we have. You cannot arrest our personnel. I want to meet with Commander Sun, Chief of Staff Xiao of the Xingyuan, and Mayor Zhang, etc. Everything must be discussed in person before we talk." They said: "The people here have all been gathered in the living room downstairs." Comrade Yuzhang immediately went downstairs to the living room to meet the comrades. The comrades complained about how they had suffered atrocities, and the loss of money, watches, and other items. Comrade Yuzhang said to everyone: "Commander Sun has come with official business, wanting us to withdraw; we will never withdraw unless we get a clear order from the government and the Central Committee of our Party; we must maintain our Communist Party's position and integrity. As for the military police breaking down the door without first giving official documents and searching arbitrarily, that is wrong. I will go to see Commander Sun, Mayor Zhang, etc." They didn't allow it. Now I'm going to make a phone call." Comrade Yuzhang immediately went to make a phone call, but the phone was also cut off by them, and he couldn't get through. They also said: "Mr. Wu is old, please go upstairs and rest in bed, and wait for dawn; Commander Sun will come tomorrow." Comrade Yuzhang said: "If you let our comrades go back to their rooms to rest, then I will go to rest; otherwise, I want to be with the comrades." They said: "They can also rest here, please go back to rest, old man." The comrades also persuaded Old Wu to go to rest, and Old Wu went upstairs to wait for dawn. Dozens of military police came and went in our temporary concentration camp—the living room and Old Wu's room, and many plainclothes secret agents and military police repeatedly searched the rooms until about ten o'clock on the morning of the 28th, when Sun Yuanliang arrived and met with Old Wu, repeating his official business again. Old Wu repeated the central statement of February 21st: he would never withdraw without a clear order from the government and the Central Committee of our Party and our Party's Nanjing Liaison Office. And he said: "We are determined to stick to our posts, we are not afraid of any pressure. I am already seventy years old, I have participated in the Reform Movement of 1898, the Tongmenghui, the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, the Great Revolution of 1925-27, the Ten-Year Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the current movement to fight for independence, peace, and democracy; since I decided to make revolution, I have long put life and death aside, I often think of finding a suitable place to die, and this place may be a suitable place to die. Who can avoid death, as long as one dies with value, one person's death can cultivate millions of people, the outstanding sons and daughters of our Chinese nation have a glorious tradition of not fearing death. I want to maintain the noble and heroic personality of revolutionary party members and communists; now although the peace talks have stalled, the door is not completely closed; this kind of action will finally close the door to peace talks." After Old Wu said these impassioned words, he demanded the withdrawal of the military police monitoring; even if they wanted to monitor, they could monitor outside the room. Sun said: "For the sake of prudent 'protection,' we can't help but do this." Old Wu also requested to meet with Xiao Yisu, the chief of staff of the Chongqing Xingyuan, and Zhang Dulun, the mayor of Chongqing. Sun replied that he could go and discuss it with them. Old Wu asked about the situation of the Xinhua Daily, and Sun replied that the situation was very smooth and stable, so please rest assured. Old Wu requested to meet with Xiong Fu and Yu Gang, the heads of the Xinhua Daily; Sun replied that he would convey it and asked Old Wu to prepare to leave Chongqing. After Sun left, Old Wu immediately drafted a telegram to Zhang, the director of the Chongqing Xingyuan in Nanjing, explaining the situation of being suddenly searched and monitored by a large number of military police on the morning of the 27th, and expressing that he could not withdraw without a government order and an order from the Central Committee of our Party. He asked him to quickly order the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters to immediately stop the monitoring and to allow the Xinhua Daily to continue publishing and operating as usual. This telegram was sent to Sun Yuanliang for forwarding, and by March 1st, two days after the incident, armed military police were still standing in the room, shouting day and night, so that Old Wu could not sleep for a moment. He often talked to the comrades and the military police about the heroic deeds of revolutionary history, and the spirit of sacrifice of revolutionary party members and communists, emphasizing that we must inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition of our nation; many moving deeds were either personally experienced or witnessed by him. This not only moved our comrades, but also moved many military police. On the afternoon of March 1st, at 6 p.m., Chief of Staff Xiao of the Xingyuan and Mayor Zhang came to see Old Wu, and Old Wu told them about what had happened; Xiao said that he didn't know about it beforehand, but yesterday Commander Sun told him on the phone that he had sent official business to Mr. Wu at 10 p.m. the night before, and acted at 3 a.m., and the process was very good; he didn't know that there were many bad situations. But when he saw the military police standing in the room, he had to say that they had to carry out special "protection." In the evening, Mr. Bode, the American Deputy Consul in Chongqing, brought a telegram from Dong Lao, saying that American planes would come to Chongqing on the 5th and 6th, each carrying fifty people to evacuate to Yan'an. On March 2nd, Xiong Fu and Yu Gang from the newspaper office came to see Old Wu under the supervision of military police. When Old Wu talked with Xiong and Yu, several plainclothes people wearing military uniforms also sat down to take notes, and their aura was extremely fierce. When Yu Gang started to report on the situation of the newspaper being closed, one of the secret agents said: You can only speak for forty-five minutes. Old Wu said sternly: "Why?! We are not prisoners, don't we even have the freedom to speak? I'm prepared to speak for three hours, I want to finish speaking before I die!" That person dared not speak. Yu Gang reported that the military police came to the newspaper like they were facing a formidable enemy, and searched everywhere; then Old Wu spoke, explaining that this atrocity was the Kuomintang's final closing of the door to peace talks, and its determination to fight the civil war to the end. Our position is firm, we must maintain the personality of our Party members, we are not afraid of sacrifice, the three hundred and eighty-five of us in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming are as united as steel, we are not afraid of any pressure! If we sacrifice one person, ten thousand people will rise up to replace us. We must be outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation..." Old Wu became more and more impassioned as he spoke, and the secret agent tried to stop him, but Old Wu continued to speak eloquently. The comrades saw that Old Wu was too excited, so they asked Old Wu not to speak anymore; Comrade Yu Gang said: "I will convey Old Wu's words." When comrades Yu Gang and Xiong Fu left, Old Wu said: "Please comrades be strong and unite like steel!" Yu Gang replied loudly: "We will definitely not be afraid!" The attitude was extremely sad and indignant. Everyone in the room was moved to tears. Since then, many of the military police have been moved, and their attitude has become better day by day. Old Wu took the opportunity to talk to comrades and soldiers about stories of being a person and making revolution, and many military police said that they had only now realized the nobility of the personality of Old Wu and the communists. Later, when they were about to leave, some military police soldiers asked Old Wu to write inscriptions, and Old Wu gave them many books. On March 9th, our personnel in Chongqing were finally forced to leave Chongqing. However, we will always maintain deep spiritual connections with the people of Chongqing and all parts of the Southwest.

　　吴玉章同志等返延
    在渝时曾遭蒋特百般迫害吴老正气磅礴军警亦感动
    【新华社延安十四日电】中共重庆代表吴玉章同志及中共重庆联络处工作人员以及重庆新华日报全部工作人员九日由渝被迫撤返回延。记者特往访问，询以他们在重庆被大批军警搜查拘禁及被迫撤退的经过情形，除新华日报部分被包围监视搜查情形已略有发表外，对于重庆联络处被监视搜查情形，据云：
    二月廿七日深夜里三点钟的时候，中共驻渝联络处曾家岩二十三号突来军警不下百余人猛烈打门，同人在睡梦中惊醒，启门，数十荷枪军警及一部便衣特务人员即蜂涌而入，遍处搜查，翻箱倒柜，衣物书籍狼籍室内。最后蜂涌入吴玉章同志室内，玉章同志穿衣急起，问何事，他们声称：“为‘保护’你们的安全，要你们撤退。”问他们有无公事，国民党警备司令部处长杨叔平说：“有。”玉章同志拆开重庆警备司令部孙元良来函一看，说是“为保护中共在渝人员之安全及地方治安之维持，中共人员须于三月五日以前一律撤退”等语，玉章同志即向杨声明：“中共京沪渝联络处是政府允许设立的，我们非得政府命令或我党命令不能撤退，我们必须坚守我们的职位，不能撤退的。”旁边即有便衣特务人员说：“你们破坏和谈，称兵作乱，与人民为敌，使人民不得安定，民众十分愤激”等。玉章同志立即反问：“谁与人民为敌？谁在积极打内战？谁使人民生活不安？我们住的对面就是兵工厂，数月以来日日赶造军火；征兵征粮，急于星火；交通工具，全作军运；一切是战争状态。谁要打内战，还不明白吗？”玉章同志声色俱厉，使对方只得说：“我同你说不清楚。”杨才说：“请先生把公文看完，恐先生看油印的不清楚，这里还有一份墨笔写的。下面还有司令愿代备交通工具，并派兵‘护送’返回延安等事，请先生不要着急。”玉章同志说：“你们已把我们所有搞的这样乱，我们的人员你们不能捕去，我要同孙司令、行辕萧参谋长、张市长等见面，一切要面谈后再说。”他们说：“你们这里的人都已集中在楼下客厅里。”玉章同志即下楼到客厅，与同志们见面。同志们诉说他们怎样遭受暴行，及金钱、表等等物件之损失，玉章同志向大家说：“孙司令员有公事来，要我们撤退；我们非得政府明令及我党中央命令，是誓死不撤退的；我们要保持我们共产党的立场与气节。至于军警未先给公事即破门而入，且肆意搜查，是不对的，我就要去见孙司令、张市长等，他们不许，现在我去打电话。”玉章同志即去打电话，但是电话也被他们切断了，打不通。他们又说：“吴先生年老了，请上楼在床上休息，以待天明；明天孙司令就会来。”玉章同志说：“你们如果让我们同志各回房间去休息，我才去休息；否则，我要与同志们在一起。”他们说：“此地他们也可以休息的，还是请老先生去休息罢。”同志们大家也劝吴老去休息，吴老才上楼去，以待天明。室内数十名军警往来我们临时集中营——客厅及吴老房间里，不少的便衣特务及军警屡次搜索各房间，直到廿八日晨十时顷，孙元良才到来，与吴老面谈，照他的公事再述一遍。吴老照二月二十一日中央声明：非政府明令及我党中央与我党南京联络处有命令，决不能撤退，说了一遍。并说：“我们誓死坚持我们的岗位，任何压力我们都不怕的。我现已将七十岁的人了，我从戊戍政变、同盟会、辛亥革命、五四运动、一九二五——二七大革命、十年国内战争、抗日战争、现在的争取独立和平民主运动，我都参加；自从决心革命以来，生死早已置诸度外，我常想找一适当的死所，此地或者是适当的死所了。人谁不死，只要死得有价值，死一个人可以培养出千万的人，我们中华民族的优秀儿女是有光荣不怕死的传统的。我要为革命党人共产党员保持高尚英勇的人格；现在和谈虽停顿，门还未关死；此等行动，将最后关死和谈之门。”吴老慷慨激昂的说这番话以后，即要求撤退监视的军警；即使要监视，可以到室外去监视。孙说：“为慎重‘保护’起见，不能不如此。”吴老又要求与重庆行辕参谋长萧毅肃及重庆市市长张笃伦见面，孙答他可以去和他们商量。吴老问新华日报情形，孙答情形很顺利安定，请放心。吴老要求与新华日报社负责人熊复、于刚等见面；孙答当转告，并请吴老准备撤离重庆。孙去后，吴老即拟电致南京之重庆行辕主任张说明廿七日晨突被大批军警搜查监视情形，并表示如无政府明令和我党中央命令不能撤退。请他速军重庆警备司令部立即停止监视，并使新华日报照旧发行营业。此电即送请孙元良代发，及至三月一日，出事已过两天，荷枪军警仍林立室中，日夜叫嚣异常，以致吴老未能安睡一刻。他常常在同志们和军警群众间讲说革命历史的英勇事迹，和革命党人及共产党员的牺牲精神，强调必须承继和发扬我民族的革命传统；许多可歌可泣的事迹，都是他亲身所历或见着的。这不仅使得我们的同志们感动，而且使许多军警都大为感动。三月一日午后六时，行辕萧参谋长和张市长来见吴老，吴老告以经过情形；萧说他事前并不知道，只是昨天孙司令在电话中告诉他说前晚十时送公事与吴先生，三时即行动，经过很良好；并不知道有许多不好的情形。但他看见室内军警林立，又只得说他们不得不特别进行“保护”。晚间重庆美国副领事布德持董老来电，说美国飞机将于五日及六日各一架来渝，各载五十人撤退到延安，三月二日报社熊复、于刚在军警监视下陪同来见吴老，当吴老与熊、于谈话时，有几个便衣和着军衣的人也坐下来作记录，他们的气势极端凶恶。于刚一开始报告报社被封闭情形，有一特务就说：只能讲话四十五分钟。吴老声色俱厉的说：“为什么？！我们不是囚犯，连讲话的自由都没有了吗？我准备要讲三点钟的话，我要趁我还没有死把话讲完！”那人不敢讲话了。于刚报告当时军警如临大敌，凶恶的到报馆来，到处搜查情形；随后吴老讲话，说明此次的暴行系国民党最后关死和谈之门，决心内战到底。我们的立场是确定的，我们要保持我们党员的人格，我们不怕牺牲，我们在重庆、成都、昆明的三百八十五人团结得钢铁一样，任何压力我们都不怕的！我们牺牲一个人，会有一万人起来代替我们。要作中华民族的优秀儿女……”，吴老越讲越激昂，特务曾加制止，吴老更滔滔不绝的讲下去。同志们看吴老太兴奋了，随请吴老不必再讲了；于刚同志说：“我就将吴老的话传达下去。”于刚、熊复两同志离去时，吴老说：“请同志们坚强团结得钢铁一样！”于刚大声答说：“我们一定不怕！”态度异常悲愤。全室之人有为之感动而流泪者。自此以后，军警中有许多人受了感动，态度一天比一天好。吴老有机会就和同志们及士兵等谈论作人及革命的故事，有许多军警表示对于吴老、对于共产党员，到今天才认识了他们人格的高尚。以后临行时，有些军警士兵请吴老题字，吴老送他们许多书。三月九日，我们在重庆的人员终于被迫离开了重庆。但是，我们和重庆以及西南各地人民永远保持着深厚的精神联系。
