    Ji-Lu-Yu Government Organs and Factories
    Practice Thrift and Self-Reliance to Support the Front Lines
    [Reported from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 19th] Government organs and factories in the Ji-Lu-Yu area are enthusiastically launching a campaign of thrift and self-reliance in response to the call of the Central Bureau. Preliminary and incomplete statistics from several locations show that 70,000 jin of millet have been saved and used to support the front lines, enough to feed three companies of soldiers for half a year. More than 50 workers at the Ji-Lu-Yu Printing Factory are saving their entire year's wages. Chen Shuangjin from the Third Factory, Gui Lianke from the Second Factory, and others are saving their entire wages and daily necessities such as sleeves and soap. The entire factory saves more than 1.25 million yuan in half a year. The Ji-Lu-Yu area and county bureaus have also formulated collective and individual plans for thrift and self-reliance. The District Bureau and county bureaus in Jibei, Puyang, Kunwu, and other counties have saved a total of 7,500 jin of millet, equivalent to one-third of their total operating expenses. The First Special District Office saved 12,000 jin of millet. Twenty cadres from the provincial capital and county government saved all their single-layer clothing, shoes, socks, and subsidies for half a year, equivalent to 5,200 jin of millet. The Eighth Special District Office and its directly subordinate organs are also discussing thrift and self-reliance. The First District Committee called on party members to save as much as possible, "Save one more jin of rice, make the difficulty one point less." The thrift and self-reliance campaign is now being vigorously carried out in the district.
