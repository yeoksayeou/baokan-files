    Pingding and Bo'ai Refugee Women Engage in Textile Production for Self-Salvation
    [Our Dispatch] In order to persist in the struggle against the enemy and respond to the government's call for production and self-salvation to overcome the disaster, more than 18,000 disaster refugees in Pingding used the fruits that were not distributed in the mass movement last winter as capital to organize 17 village sideline immigrant cooperatives in areas such as Dongxi Beian to vigorously develop textile production. At the beginning, everyone was not very confident in textile production, thinking that they could not learn it, and even if they did, it would not solve the problem. The leadership mobilized them with "even if you can't add a catty, add two taels." Dongxi Beian organized 98 people, who spun 90 catties of cotton for the Di Yu Cooperative in 14 days, and exchanged it for 150 catties of cotton. This improved everyone's morale. The cooperative built spinning wheels day and night, and women actively participated in spinning. Of the 1,800 female laborers, more than 1,500 have started spinning. In 14 days, they spun more than 2,600 catties of cotton, which can be exchanged for 132 dan of miscellaneous grains, greatly alleviating this year's spring famine. The refugee textile movement is now being promoted universally.

    [Our Dispatch] Refugee women who withdrew from the Bo'ai First District are organized to engage in textile production to solve their livelihood difficulties. In the past, most of them made a living by setting up stalls and were unwilling to spin. The leadership used methods such as mass mobilization meetings, individual talks, and practical accounting to get their ideas straightened out. Chen Shuying said: "The season is about to change, and you can't earn much money by setting up a stall. Only by spinning cotton well can you exchange it for unlined clothing!" Then, using the method of "voluntary association based on mutual interest," 24 people formed four textile groups and proposed competitions with each other. In order to save lamp oil, they concentrated in one house as a group. Later, they also helped each other to weave cloth, and adopted methods such as recording work points and exchanging equivalent values, and formulated a bonus system: four taels of spun yarn is equivalent to one work point, one zhang of woven cloth is equivalent to one work point, yarn is divided into first, second, and third grades, and after the woven cloth is sold, bonuses are distributed according to work points, and morale is very high. They tell everyone they meet: "We'll wear new clothes back to our hometown!" (Jian Zhong)

    平定博爱难民妇女纺织生产自救
    【本报讯】平定一万八千余灾难民，为坚持对敌斗争，响应政府的生产自救战胜灾荒号召，把去冬群运一部未及分配的果实做资金，组织了东西北岸等十七个村边地移民合作社，大力开展纺织。开始时，大家对纺织信心不大，认为学不会，学会也解决不了问题。领导上以“不能添斤也添两”来动员，东西北岸组织了九十八人，十四天给地峪合作社纺花九十斤，换回花一百五十斤。这样，提高了大家的情绪，合作社星夜造纺车，妇女们积极参加纺织，一千八百女劳力，已有一千五百余人开始纺织。十四天内纺花二千六百余斤，可买杂粮一百三十二石，大大减轻了今年的春荒。现难民纺织运动正普遍推进中。

    【本报讯】博爱一区撤出之难民妇女组织起来从事纺织，解决生活困难。她们过去多摆摊为生，不愿纺织。领导上用大会动员与个别谈话、实际算账方法，打通思想。陈树英说：“马上就要换季，靠摆摊赚不下几个钱，只有好好纺花，才能换单衣！”接着用“对心思自愿结合”的办法，二十四个人组成四个纺织小组，彼此提出竞赛。为节省灯油，以组为单位集中到一家纺，以后又互助织布，并采取记工、折工等价交换办法，订出分红制度：纺线四两顶工一个，织布一丈顶工一个，线分一、二、三等，织成布出售后按工分红，情绪很高。她们见人就说：“穿上新衣回老家！”  （建中）
