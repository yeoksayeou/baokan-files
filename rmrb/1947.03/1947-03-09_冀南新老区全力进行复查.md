　　Jinnan New and Old Areas Go All Out for Re-examination
　　[Jinnan, March 7th (This newspaper)] The land reform movement in the new and old areas of Jinnan entered an in-depth stage in January. The main contents of the movement are to re-mobilize the masses, investigate hidden landlords; mobilize cadres and activists to return the excess gains; and carry out a thorough "backward village" campaign to thoroughly implement "land to the tiller." The inspection revealed that a large number of landlords, using cunning and hidden methods, continued their feudal exploitation and rule. For example, in three sub-districts of the fourth district of Ji County, 74 hidden landlords and 86 incompletely liquidated households were found. In the sixth (eighth district) of Guan County, 22 hidden landlords were found, and more than 100 rich peasants had not cut off their feudal tails; more than 200 landlords and feudal rich peasants still possessed 62,000 mu of land and a large amount of materials. Yongnian found that 133 villages still retained feudal tails. Thirty-three villages near the city and small villages had not been mobilized. The Liu Ying landlord still retained 43 head of livestock, 47 waterwheels, and 10 carts. In the second district of Yongzhi, the struggle against landlords was generally very light, and feudal politics and exploitation were not completely eliminated. Hou Village, Xiao Village, and Tian Village in the fourth district all had "fake struggles." The peasants and a certain landlord agreed that "if Chiang Kai-shek comes, the land will still belong to the landlord." The peasants divided the carts but still placed them in the landlord's house, and had to beg the landlord for permission to use them. Later inspections revealed that the distribution of fruits was unfair, and village cadres and activists were seriously corrupt and wasteful, hindering the realization of "land to the tiller." For example, in the sixth and eighth districts of Guan County, after the anti-traitor liquidation, nearly 20,000 mu of land was obtained. In most villages, the land was priced and sold, and most of the land fell into the hands of the upper strata of poor peasants. Among the 1,450 extremely poor people, only 699 mu of land were obtained. In the key village of Wali in Linqing, 300 mu of land were seized, but only 200 mu were distributed to the masses, and the remaining 100 mu were cultivated by the militia. The floating wealth was about one million yuan, but it had not been distributed to the masses for more than half a year. Experience has proved that we must fully recognize the hidden conspiracies of the landlords and repeatedly conduct re-examination and liquidation to thoroughly eliminate feudal landlords. The reason why landlords were omitted in Ji County was that some landlords falsely divided their families, appearing to be middle peasants, but were actually landlords. For example, in Xuejiazhai, a landlord with more than three qing of land was found. The three generations of the family were scattered, but they still controlled the village power and exploited the peasants. Some escaped landlords scattered the land and temporarily asked others to cultivate and eat the grain themselves or falsely mortgaged it. Matou and Houxinzhai did not liquidate these landlords. Some landlords speculated in offering land, and some landlords won over cadres and used the method of changing their class status to "enlighten" to evade liquidation; some landlords spread the idea of ​​the change of dynasty and threatened the masses. The reason why landlords were not eliminated in many places and the feudal tails of rich peasants were not cut off was due to the district cadres forcing the masses to "take care of the landlord's life" and "grasp the rich peasant policy." The leadership has repeatedly proposed a major inspection of emancipation; it was ultimately hindered by the "complacency" and "almost" thinking in various places. This is an extremely painful lesson. Since February, cadres in various parts of Jinnan have carried out inspections from top to bottom, eliminated complacency and "almost" thinking, and universally launched a land reform inspection movement with the main contents of investigating hidden landlords and mobilizing cadres and activists to return over-distributed fruits. At present, it is still the beginning of the inspection. Cadres in various counties are now going all out to go deep and conduct serious inspections.

　　冀南新老区全力进行复查
    【本报冀南七日电】冀南新老地区土地改革运动于一月份进入深入阶段。运动的主要内容为重新发动群众，清查隐蔽地主；动员干部积极分子，退出多得果实；突击“落后村”，彻底实行耕者有其田。从检查中发现尚有大量地主，以狡猾隐蔽方式，继续其封建剥削统治。如冀县四区三个小区，清查出隐蔽地主七十四户、清算不彻底的八十六户。冠县六（八区，清查出隐蔽地主二十二户，百余户富农未割封建尾巴；二百余户地主、封建富农还拥有六万二千亩土地和大量物资。永年清查出一百卅三村留有封建尾巴。城附近村庄及小村有三十三村没有发动。刘营地主还保有四十三头牲口、四十七辆水车、十辆大车。永智二区对地主斗的一般都很轻，封建政治与剥削均未彻底消灭。四区后村庄、萧庄、田庄均有“假斗争”，农民和某某地主约定“老蒋来了土地仍归地主”。农民分了大车仍放在地主家中，使用时得向地主求情。后检查中发现果实分配不公，村干、积极分子贪污浪费果实严重，障碍着“耕者有其田”的实现。如冠县六、八区经过反奸清算，获得土地近两万亩，多数村庄将土地定价出卖，大部土地落入贫农以上阶层中，赤贫一千四百五十人中，仅得到土地六百九十九亩。临清重点村洼里，斗出三百亩土地，只分给群众二百亩，余一百亩归民兵耕种。浮财约百万元，半年多还没分给群众。经验证明：必须足够认识地主的隐蔽阴谋，反复的进行复查清算，才能彻底消灭封建地主。冀县地主被遗漏原因是有的地主假分家，看似中农、实乃地主。如薛家寨查出一家三顷多地的地主，老少三辈分的七零八落，但仍掌握着村权，剥削农民。有的逃亡地主把土地疏散，暂叫别人自种自吃纳粮，或假当出去。码头、后新寨就未清算这类地主，有的地主投机献田，有的地主拉拢干部用改变成份“开明”办法逃避了清算；有的地主散布变天思想，威吓群众。不少地方地主未被消灭，富农封建尾巴未被割去，是由于区干部强制群众，“照顾地主生活”，“掌握富农政策”所致。领导上曾多次提出翻身大检查；终为各地“自满”“差不多”思想所障碍，这是极为惨痛的教训。二月份以来，冀南各地干部纷纷自上而下的进行了检查，扫除了自满、“差不多”思想，普遍展开了以清查隐蔽地主动员干部、积极分子退出多分果实为主要内容的土地改革检查运动。目前来说，还是检查的开始，各县干部现正全力深入，认真检查中。
