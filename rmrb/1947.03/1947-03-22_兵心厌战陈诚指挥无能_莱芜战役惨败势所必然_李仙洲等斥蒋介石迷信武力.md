Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 18th: Senior Chiang army officers, including Li Xianzhou, Deputy Commander of the Second Appeasement Zone of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, and the officers of the 73rd Army, the reorganized 46th Division (original army), who laid down their weapons in the Laiwu Campaign, held a forum a few days ago. They generally believed that the soldiers' war-weariness and Chen Cheng's incompetent command were the two major reasons for the disastrous defeat in this campaign. They also strongly stated that Chiang Kai-shek's blind faith in military force was bound to lead to failure. Li Chen, Major General and Deputy Commander of the 73rd Army, took the lead in pointing out: "The above made a wrong judgment, causing us (referring to the 73rd Army) and the 46th Division to enter the pocket." Hai Jingqiang, Major General and Brigade Commander of the 188th Brigade of the 46th Division, summarized that Wang Yaowu, Commander of the Second Appeasement Zone, ordered the division to withdraw from Xintai on the 16th of last month and arrive in Yanzhuang (15 li north of Xintai) on the same day, but the next day he ordered them to return to Xintai. He said: "In this way, the fate of death was doomed." Li Xianzhou said: "Although I am the deputy commander, I am actually just a senior messenger when I come to the front." He also said: "Chief of Staff Chen (Chen Cheng) is responsible for strategic guidance. His strategic guidance is wrong, and tactical measures cannot remedy it." Yang Ming, Major General and Commander of the 15th Division of the 77th Army, said: "The 46th Division has been fighting in Xintai for two days. Our 73rd Army asked the higher authorities for a brief, and Chen Cheng replied in a telegram: "There is no war in Xintai." Naturally, he will not be able to appreciate the soldiers' widespread war-weariness. He is in a high position and wields great power, and he is self-righteous, so he is innocent." Finally, Major General Li Chen used Hitler and Mussolini as examples to criticize Chiang Kai-shek, saying that if he insists on believing in military force, he will definitely fail. He believes that a broad movement to appeal for peace and oppose the civil war must be launched. The participants unanimously decided to jointly issue a circular telegram and immediately elected a drafter. The meeting lasted for more than three hours before it adjourned.

    兵心厌战陈诚指挥无能
    莱芜战役惨败势所必然
    李仙洲等斥蒋介石迷信武力
    【新华社华东前线十八日电】莱芜战役中放下武器之蒋军徐州绥靖公署第二绥靖区副司令官李仙洲暨七十三军整四十六师（原军）等高级军官于日前举行座谈，咸认我军兵心厌战与陈诚之指挥无能，为此次战役惨败之两大原因，并力称：蒋介石迷信武力，一定失败。七十三军副军长李琛少将首起指出：“上面判断错误，致使我们（指七十三军）与四十六师都进入了口袋。”四十六师一八八旅旅长海竞强少将概述第二绥区司令官王耀武曾于上月十六日命令该师自新泰撤退，当日抵颜庄（新泰北十五里），但次日又命令他们重到新泰，他说：“如此，死的命运便注定了。”李仙洲氏称：“我虽是副司令官，但实际上到前方来仅是一个高级传令兵。”又说：“陈总长（陈诚）是负责战略指导责任的，他战略指导错误，战术上无法补救。”七十七军十五师师长杨明少将则谓：“四十六师在新泰作战两天了，我们七十三军向上级请示要略，陈诚回电说：“新泰无战事。”自然他更不会体会到士兵们普遍的厌战情绪，他位高权大，刚愎自用，也就无罪了。”最后李琛少将以希特勒、墨索里尼为引证斥责蒋介石，若要迷信武力一定会失败，他认为必须发动一个广泛的呼吁和平反对内战运动，与会者一致决议联名发表通电，并即推选起草人。会议历三小时余始散。
