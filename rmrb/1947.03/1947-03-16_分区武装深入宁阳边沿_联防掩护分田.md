[This dispatch comes from the Jilu Yu Border Region on the 14th] The Ningyang border area is frequently harassed by the puppet bandits Zhang Ziming and Wu Huawen's troops. The armed forces of the Seventh Sub-district are penetrating the rural areas to mobilize the masses, implementing joint defense while distributing land. Since December, more than 100 people, including the puppet bandit Xiao Luoyang Huang Qixing, have been arrested, enabling farmers in more than 80 villages to obtain land. During the combined implementation of joint defense and land distribution, the district joint defense teams closely cooperated with the sub-district armed forces and the masses, combining the militia self-defense forces to help the masses stand guard, patrol, and enforce martial law, and penetratingly conducted land reform propaganda and mobilization, supporting the masses. The leadership proposed "To fight the tiger, first strike the head; to weed, uproot the roots." First, the land and property of the ringleaders of the bad elements, such as Zhang Ziming's secretary Zhang Xiuyu and Wu Huawen's secretary Liu Fuchun, were struggled against and distributed to the peasants. Then, 46 evil despotic landlords from the third and fifth districts, such as Zhu Baozhen, who were exposed by activists, were detained to remove "stones" for the masses. A forum was also convened with elementary school teachers and intellectuals, calling on them to participate in the land reform. After the county held a poor peasant congress on February 9, a wave of land reform was set off everywhere. The second district, only thirty miles away from Yanzhou, which was occupied by the puppet Wu Huawen, is also enthusiastically carrying out land distribution.

　　分区武装深入宁阳边沿
    联防掩护分田
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】宁阳边缘区常受伪匪张子明、吴化文部骚扰，七分区武装深入农村发动群众，一面联防一面分田。自十二月以来逮捕伪匪小洛阳黄其兴以下百余人，使八十余村的农民得到土地。在联防分田结合进行中，各区联队配合分区武装与群众密切联系，结合民兵自卫队帮助群众站岗放哨戒严，并深入土地改革宣传鼓动，给群众撑腰。领导上提出“打虎先打头，锄草要刨根。”先将张子明书记张秀玉、吴化文秘书刘怫春等坏蛋头子的地财斗出，分给农民，接着将积极分子所检举的三、五区恶霸地主朱宝贞等四十六人扣押，给群众搬“石头”，又召集小学教员知识分子座谈会，号召他们参加土地改革。二月九日县召开贫农大会后，土地改革热潮便到处掀起，距伪吴化文所盘据之兖州仅三十里的二区，亦热烈进行分田。
