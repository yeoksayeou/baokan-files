Deepen Thought Mobilization in the Movement
    Wang Zongqi

    Carrying out thought movements and focusing on systematically raising the masses' class consciousness is the main direction for deepening the movement.

    During the Great Movement, in Changzhi, each village adopted methods of individual mobilization, collective grievance-telling to understand thoughts, prescribing the right remedy, discarding burdens and thoroughly separating from landlords, etc., to partially and unsystematically resolve issues such as whether to struggle or not, whether the struggle is just, who owns the fruits of the struggle, and ideological problems such as conscience, fate, and superstition, initially raising the peasants' class consciousness. However, precisely because it was partial and unsystematic, backward thoughts still existed in the peasants' minds, such as pitying the landlords for giving them food, still talking about conscience and fate, and believing that struggle was a new decree, that the earth's veins revolved every thirty years, etc. Therefore, in action, it was quite common to preserve things and personal belongings for the landlords, and to be unable to break away from the landlords. In order to finally raise the peasants' class consciousness, systematically clarify their thinking, finally break away from the landlord class, separate families, and ideologically draw a class boundary, it is necessary to launch a thought movement including all peasants, men, women, old and young. Only when this thought movement is carried out can we achieve the final elimination of landlords and the complete class consciousness of the peasants.

    Raising the Peasants' Class Consciousness is the Main Goal of the Thought Movement

    The feudal thoughts of the peasants are extraordinarily complex and specific. For example, during the struggle and grievance-telling, they dare to beat and struggle against the landlords, but after the struggle, they pity the landlords and talk about conscience; they hate the landlords of their own village, but not the landlords of other villages; they hate the landlords who have exploited them, but not the landlords who have not exploited them. They do not regard the landlord as a class, but as the problem of a certain individual. For example, Huo Village believes that there is a distinction between good and bad landlords, regarding the good life of the landlords as a result of their ability to manage and succeed; others regard their own poverty as innate, a lack of good fortune, often separating superstition and fate from the landlord class, failing to understand that superstition and fate are the tricks of the feudal landlord class, serving the feudal landlord class. Therefore, it is necessary to make all peasants clearly recognize that so-called conscience, fate, and secret societies are all tricks and methods of the landlord class to consolidate their exploitation and rule. We should not simply discuss whether there are gods or ghosts, but should trace the roots to the landlord class and make the masses clear about the viewpoints of the two classes.

    In the thought movement to raise the masses' class consciousness, Huo Village created a way to open the door to the thought movement by comparing class lives, and during the movement, a series of centrally focused solutions gradually raised the masses' class consciousness. The process is as follows: The first stage mainly involves settling the total accounts with the landlords. In settling the total accounts with the landlords, a profound exposure of the landlords' lives was made, such as explaining that the landlord Cai Liu-hai only got up halfway through the morning, ate sesame seed cakes and egg soup, and took tonics; he went out in a sedan car; a concubine followed to light his cigarette, he slept under an eight-panel quilt, and under a mosquito net. After calculating the total account, Cai Liu-hai exploited forty-two households in Huo Village, totaling eighty-five mu of land and twenty-three houses.

    In settling the total life accounts with the landlords, it was discovered that some people believed that the landlords: men have steel, women have ambition, have the materials to succeed; some people believed that the landlords have fate and good fortune. At this time, the question of why they have fate and good fortune, such as conscience, fate, and superstition, was naturally discussed, and finally the conclusion was reached: "It is not poor fate, but the ditch has not been filled," "Superstition and fate are the laws of the landlords, to bewilder the poor and exploit them."

    After this problem was solved, it was discovered that some people said that there was a distinction between good and bad landlords; some people said that the landlords of their own village were not good, but the landlords of other villages were good, that the landlords who had exploited them were not good, but the landlords who had not exploited them were good. After the problem was discovered, a debate was launched, and finally the following conclusion was reached for the landlord class: "Landlords are like dogs, eating excrement all over the world"; "Landlords are like wolves, eating sheep all over the world." Landlords are not divided into good and bad, "The yellow wolf is more cunning than the black wolf, and the leopard jumps out from the middle, one is more cunning than the other." This made the masses clear that the landlord was a class rather than an individual. They realized that in the old society, landlords with money could travel all over the world, and the poor without money could not move an inch; in the new society, the liberated households can travel all over the world, and the bad landlords cannot move an inch.

    After solving this ideological problem, someone proposed: mother and child are connected, and relatives and friends cannot break off relations. After discussion, everyone realized that coal cannot build walls, daughters cannot support their mothers, relatives spend relatives' money, landlords exploit us with landlords' money, thus finally making the peasants more aware that friends spend friends' money, and break off relations with landlords.

    After this problem was solved, the various conspiracies and tricks of the landlord class in the movement and their future plans and escape routes were discussed. At this time, the peasants politically exposed the landlords' conspiracies and recognized that the landlords started out strong, then pretended to be poor, and then wanted to change the sky, with two hearts. Thus, after a step-by-step awakening of the peasant class, they turned to investigating the landlords, and found more than 400 silver dollars, twelve dan of grain, and fifteen quilts.

    Organizational Leadership of the Thought Movement

    Small Group Discussions to Break Through Typical Cases

    If you want to start a thought movement, you must emphasize small group discussions. Only through small group discussions can the true thoughts of the masses be exposed. In small group discussions, you must be good at inducing breakthroughs in typical cases, breakthroughs in those who dare to boldly expose their thoughts and are the quickest to awaken, and use these people to promote the movement. For example, in Henan, during the winter study, Shuang Suo was the first to dare to expose his true thoughts, thus enlightening the masses' free thinking. Also, because he was the fastest to awaken ideologically, he led the broad masses. Yuanjia Village is another typical case. First, they seized the first landlord, Tianxin Yuan, and discussed whether Tianxin Yuan was enlightened, whether the peasants depended on Tianxin Yuan, whether Tianxin Yuan depended on the peasants, whether Tianxin Yuan spoke of conscience or not, and mobilized the masses' thoughts. This is another way to break through typical cases.

    Concentrate on Problems, Winter School Debates, from Typical to Comprehensive, from Confused to Clear

    For example, Tianhe seized the masses' large number of prominent secret society, superstition, and fate ideas, concentrated them, and launched a discussion at the winter school. They debated whether there were gods or not, and studied whether relying on the lords was a loss or a gain. At first, they thought there were lords, then half gods and half humans, then neither completely believing nor completely disbelieving, and finally affirmed that there were no gods or ghosts. They awakened, burned the lords, withdrew from the secret societies, and traced back to the special agent landlords like Song Rongrongfang and Ma Hanzhang.

    Freedom of Thought, Say Whatever You Have, Say a Lot of What's on Your Mind

    The Fourth District organized more than ten ideologically awakened members of different types to enlighten the winter schools in various villages in order to inspire the masses to dare to speak their minds, which had a great effect. Among them, the main ones were awakening from superstitious thoughts, awakening from sheltering landlords, and awakening from the sense of ownership, believing that struggle was just, which greatly enlightened the masses.

    On the Basis of Ideological Awakening, the Peasants Consciously Got Up to Discard Burdens, Break Off Relations, and Dig "Air Raid Shelters"

    The peasants quite commonly sheltered landlords, gave landlords things, pitied landlords, and could not break off relations with landlords. The main reason was that their thoughts were not awakened. To solve this problem, it is necessary to dig air raid shelters on the basis of ideological consciousness; and it must be the peasants' conscious action, they must dig it themselves. In Yuanjia Village, Henan, Beizhai, Huo Village and other four villages, on the basis of the peasants' consciousness, 186 households discarded the sheltering, accounting for more than a quarter of the total number of 755 households in the four villages. The four villages took out 619 pieces of clothing, 150 silver dollars, 22 quilts, and seven or eight shi of food. Of course, it must be clear that some of this was because the landlords threatened to change the sky and bought them off to preserve things, and some were ideologically backward and sheltered the landlords. The thought of sheltering landlords is like sitting on a stick under your butt, you are not stable in your heart. Sheltering is not only a burden of things, but also once you preserve things for the landlords, your thoughts are burdened. Therefore, it is necessary to dig air raid shelters on the basis of the peasants' ideological consciousness. Not only must we emphasize making them ideologically aware and discarding burdens, but more importantly, we must make them ideologically hate the landlords and not simply ask them for things; let alone force the backward to discard burdens.

　　深入运动中的思想发动
    王宗祺
    开展思想运动，集中的系统的提高群众阶级觉悟是深入运动的主要方向。
    在大运动当中，长治各村曾采取了个别发动，集体诉苦摸心思，对症下药方，放包袱与地主彻底分家等等思想发动的方法，部分的不系统的解决了该斗不该斗的问题，斗争是不是正义的问题，斗争果实是谁的以及良心命运迷信等思想问题，初步的提高了农民的阶级觉悟。但正由于是部分的不系统的所以在农民思想上仍然存在可怜地主给地主饭吃，还讲良心命运，以及认为斗争是个新法令，地脉三十年一周转等等落后思想，所以在行动上相当普遍的给地主保存东西，保存内物，和地主割不断关系。为了最后的提高农民的阶级觉悟，思想上系统的明确起来，最后的与地主阶级割断关系，分开家，思想上划清阶级界线，就必须开展一个包括男女老少全体农民的思想运动。只有这个思想运动开展起来，才能达到最后的消灭地主，与农民的完全阶级自觉。
    提高农民的阶级自觉是思想运动的主要目标
    农民的封建思想是异常复杂而具体，比如在斗争诉苦的时候对地主敢打也敢斗，可是在斗争过去后他又可怜地主讲良心；仇恨本村地主，不仇恨外村地主；仇恨剥削过自己的地主，不仇恨没有剥削过自己的地主。没有把地主看成是一个阶级，看成是某一个人的问题。如霍村认为地主有好地主坏地主之分，把地主的好过，看成是人家会闹，会成人家；还有把自己的穷，看成天生的命穷、没福气，往往把迷信和命运与地主阶级分开来看，不了解迷信命运是封建地主阶级的手腕，是为封建地主阶级而服务的。因此，必须叫全体农民明确认识，所谓良心命运会道门等等这是地主阶级为了巩固他的剥削，巩固他的统治的手腕和办法，不应当单纯的讨论，有神没有神，有鬼没有鬼，应当追根到地主阶级身上、叫群众明确了两个阶级的观点。
    在提高群众的阶级自觉的思想运动上，霍村创造了从阶级生活的对比，打开了思想运动的门，而在运动当中一系列的有中心的逐渐的解决，逐渐的提高群众的阶级觉悟，其过程是：头一段主要是给地主算总账在给地主算总账当中，给地主生活做了一个深刻的暴露，如说明地主蔡六孩半晌才起来，吃的烧饼鸡蛋汤，保养药；出门坐的是轿车；小老婆跟上点烟，盖的是八幅被，撑的是蚊帐。算了一下总账，蔡六孩在霍村剥削了四十二户，共八十五亩地，二十三间房子。
    在给地主算生活总账中，发现了一部分人认为地主：男有钢，女有志，有材料会成人家，有一部分人认为地主有命有福。这时就自然而然的讨论、为甚有命有福等良心命运迷信的问题，最后得到结论：“不是命穷，是圪道没有填平”，“迷信命运是地主的法，迷住穷人好剥削。”
    这个问题解决后，又发现有部分人说有好地主与坏地主之分；有部分人说本村地主不好外村地主好，剥削过自己的地主不好，没有剥削过自己的地主好。问题发现后，就展开了争论，最后给地主阶级得出结论：“地主好比狗，走遍天下都吃屎”；“地主好比狼，走遍天下都吃羊。”地主并不分好坏，是黄狼更比黑狼乖，当中蹦出豹子来，一个更比一个乖”。这样使群众明确了地主是一个阶级而不是一个人的问题，认识旧社会地主有钱走遍天下，穷人没钱寸步难行；新社会翻身户走遍天下，坏地主寸步难行。
    在把这个思想问题解决之后，又有人提出：子母连肠，亲戚朋友割不断关系。讨论后，大家认识了煤炭打不了墙，闺女养不了娘，亲戚有钱亲戚花，地主有钱剥削咱，这样最后使农民更加觉悟起来，朋友有钱朋友花，与地主割断关系。
    在这个问题解决了以后，接着讨论地主阶级在运动中各种阴谋鬼计以及他今后的打算和后路。这时候农民在政治上，揭露了地主的阴谋，认识到地主开始气壮，其次是装穷，接着想变天，存在两条心。这样经过了一步一步的农民阶级觉悟，转上了清查地主，查出四百余块现洋、十二石粮食、十五条被子。
    思想运动的组织领导问题
    小组讨论突破典型
    思想运动想要搞起来，必须强调小组讨论，只有小组讨论，才能暴露群众的真实思想。在小组讨论当中，要善于诱导突破典型，突破敢于大胆暴露思想，觉悟最快的人，拿这种人来推动运动。比如河南在冬学中首先是由双锁敢于暴露真实思想，因此启发了群众思想自由，也由于他思想觉悟的最快，带领了广大群众。原家庄是另一种典型，首先抓住第一户地主天心院，讨论天心院是否开明，农民靠天心院，天心院靠农民，天心院讲良心不讲良心？叫群众思想运动起来，这也是突破典型的另一种方法。
    集中问题冬学辩论由典型到全面由糊涂到明确
    如天河抓住了群众大量的突出的会道门迷信命运思想，集中起来到冬学展开讨论。辩论了有神没有神，研究了靠老爷是吃亏沾光，开始认为有老爷，到一半神一半人，再到不可不信不可全信，到最后肯定没神没鬼，觉悟起来，烧老爷，退会道门，追到宋荣荣芳马汉章等特务地主老根上。
    思想自由有什说什大量说心思话
    四区为了启发群众敢说心思话，组织了十余个不同典型的思想觉悟分子，到各村冬学启发，作用很大。其中有主要的是迷信思想觉悟起来，有的是包庇地主觉悟起来，有的是主人翁思想觉悟了，认为斗争是正义的，这样不同类型给群众的启发很大。
    在思想觉悟的基础上农民自觉的起来放包袱割断关系挖“防空洞”
    农民当中相当普遍的存在着包庇地主给地主放东西，可怜地主和地主关系割不断，主要原因是思想不觉悟，要解决这个问题，必须在思想自觉的基础上去挖防空洞；而且必须是农民自觉的行动，自己去挖。原家庄、河南、北寨、霍村等四村，在农民自觉的基础上，有一百八十六户放下包庇，占四个村总户数七百五十五户四分之一强。四个村拿出衣裳六百一十九件，银元一百五十元，被子二十二条，食粮七八石。当然必须分清楚，这当中有一部分是地主变天威胁收买给他保存东西，有部分思想上落后，给地主包庇东西。包庇地主思想是屁股下坐杆杖，自己心里不稳当，包庇不但是东西的包袱，而且一给地主保存了东西，思想就背上包袱。因此必须在农民思想自觉的基础上挖防空洞，不但要强调叫他们思想觉悟起来放下包袱，而且更重要的是要他思想仇恨地主，不可单纯向他要东西；更不能强迫落后放包袱。
