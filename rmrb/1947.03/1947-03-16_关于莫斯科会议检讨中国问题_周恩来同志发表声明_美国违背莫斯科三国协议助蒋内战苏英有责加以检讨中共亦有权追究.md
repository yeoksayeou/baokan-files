Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 13th: General Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, issued the following statement in Yan'an on March 12th:

The current meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers in Moscow is suggesting a review of the implementation of the agreement on the China problem reached by the participating countries at the Moscow Conference in December 1945. We believe this is necessary and reasonable. At that time, the participating countries unanimously agreed that China must stop the civil war and realize democratization, and that democratic elements should widely participate in all institutions of the Chinese government. The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union reiterated the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs, and the United States and the Soviet Union also agreed to withdraw their troops from China. After the agreement was issued, the US representative conducted mediation negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China. After a year of proof, the Chinese civil war not only did not stop but intensified; the democratization of the Chinese government not only was never realized but became more dictatorial. One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is that the US government's policy not only interfered in China's internal affairs but also aided Chiang in the civil war; not only did it not withdraw US troops from China, but it also used the US Navy, Army, and Air Force to participate in the Chinese civil war. This situation clearly violates the principles of the Moscow Conference agreement in December 1945. The participating countries at that time have a responsibility to review this matter. The Chinese Communist Party, as one of the parties involved in the China problem, obviously also has the right to investigate this matter. If the Kuomintang government formally requests the Four Foreign Ministers Conference or the Four Foreign Ministers Conference decides to invite China to participate in discussions on the China problem, the Chinese Communist Party will request the same rights as the Kuomintang government to send its own representatives to participate in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the China problem. Because the Kuomintang government cannot represent the 140 million people in the Chinese liberated areas led by the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic elements of China, and the US government representative has long acknowledged the equal status of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in mediating China's internal problems; therefore, it will absolutely not allow the Kuomintang government to unilaterally participate in the discussion of this issue.

　　关于莫斯科会议检讨中国问题
    周恩来同志发表声明
    美国违背莫斯科三国协议助蒋内战苏英有责加以检讨中共亦有权追究
    【新华社延安十三日电】中国共产党代表周恩来将军于三月十二日在延安发表声明如下：
    现在在莫斯科开会之四国外长会议，正建议检讨一九四五年十二月莫斯科会议参与国关于当时所达到的中国问题协议的执行情形，我们认为这是必要的，而且合理的。当时协议各国曾一致认为中国必须停止内战与实现民主化，民主分子应广泛参加中国政府一切机构，英、美、苏三国外长曾重申不干涉中国内政的政策，美、苏两国并相约从中国撤退驻军。协议发表后，美国代表即在华进行国共两方谈判的调处，经一年的证明，中国内战不仅未停，且更加剧；中国政府的民主化不仅从未实现，且更加独裁。造成此种现象的主因之一，乃美国政府的政策不仅干涉中国内政，更援蒋内战；不仅未从中国撤退美军，且更以美国海陆空军参加中国内战。这种情形，显然违背了一九四五年十二月莫斯科会议的协议原则。当时参加各国，实有责任检讨此事。中国共产党为中国问题当事人之一，显亦有权利追究此事。倘国民党政府向四国外长会议正式要求或四国外长会议决定邀请中国参加关于中国问题的如何讨论，中国共产党即要求与国民党政府有同等权利派遣自己的代表参加四国外长会议关于中国问题的讨论。因为国民党政府既不能代表中国共产党所领导的中国解放区之一万万四千万人民及中国的民主分子，而美国政府代表调处中国的内部问题已久已承认国共两方的对等地位；故绝不容国民党政府片面参加此项问题的讨论。
