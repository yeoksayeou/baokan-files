    Lucheng First District Collectively Makes Military Shoes
    Saving Labor and Materials, Sturdy and Neat
    [This newspaper, Lucheng News] The Lucheng First District recently convened a meeting of anti-war and women's rescue secretaries from various villages to summarize the four major benefits of organizing collectively to make military shoes last year: First, everyone is together, exchanging labor and helping each other, collectively cutting, saving labor and materials. According to incomplete statistics from eighteen villages, making 641 pairs of shoes saved a total of 961.5 workdays and 12.84 bolts of cloth. Second, mass inspection improves the quality of shoe making. Third, the cooperative uniformly handles the purchase and dyeing of cloth, and the shoe patterns use a single one, with consistent colors and styles, neat and uniform. Fourth, no delays, one-time delivery. With the above benefits, more than 90% of the villages in the district are preparing to adopt the method of organizing collectively to make military shoes this year.
