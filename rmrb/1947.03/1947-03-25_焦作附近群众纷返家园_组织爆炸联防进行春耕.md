    People Near Jiaozuo Return Home En Masse
    Organize Blasting Joint Defense to Carry Out Spring Plowing
    [Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo] Residents of over ten villages in the uninhabited areas near Jiaozuo, such as ××, have recently returned to their homes en masse to carry out blasting and spring plowing production. The ××gou Militia Self-Defense Force led the villagers back to the village, first rushing to build stone mines. From early morning to late at night, from river gullies to mountain tops, the sound of "ding-dang" could be heard everywhere. By the 8th of this month, more than ten villages had completed 1,900 stone mines. The Western Joint Defense of the Second District completed more than 1,000 stone mines in eight days. The masses of ×× village created the method of "burying and striking in the same place." They buried many landmines and stone mines near enemy strongholds and around the village, and organized joint defense. Every mountain top has a lookout post, maintaining mutual contact, and the people's production morale is very stable. The democratic government is now preparing loans to help farmers solve the difficulties caused by the enemy's Three Alls Policy (kill all, burn all, loot all) regarding farm tools and seeds.

    焦作附近群众纷返家园
    组织爆炸联防进行春耕
    【本报焦作讯】焦作附近无人区××等十余村群众，近纷纷重返家园，开展爆炸进行春耕生产。××沟民兵自卫队带领着全村群众回村，先赶造石雷，从早到夜，从河沟到山顶，到处一片“丁当”声。本月八日前十余村已完成一千九百多石雷。二区西联防八天内完成一千多个石雷。××村群众创造了“在那里埋就在那里打”的办法。他们把敌据点附近及村周围都埋了许多地雷、石雷，又组织了联防，各山头都有＠望哨，互相联络，群众生产情绪很安定。现民主政府正准备贷款帮助农民解决敌人三光政策造成的农具种籽等困难。（王汝珍）
