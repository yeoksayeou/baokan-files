　　Completing Half-Year Plan in One Battle
    205th Unit of Yantai Launches Campaign to Earn Merits
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The platoons, squads, and individuals of the "Yantai" 205th Unit have all formulated detailed plans for earning merits and have launched a revolutionary competition. In the recent Wenjiagou Ambush alone, the brave and resourceful heroes have earned these merits for the people: Comrade Wu Changfu of the Fourth Squad of the Seventh Battalion captured one light machine gun, one rifle, and two prisoners. Comrade Liu Chunhe of the First Squad of the Seventh Battalion captured one machine gun and one prisoner. Comrade Zhang Xuan of the First Platoon of the Eighth Battalion captured one machine gun and three prisoners. The Fifth Squad of the Eighth Battalion obtained two small cannons, eleven small cannon shells, six hand grenades, two rifles, three bayonets, and captured three prisoners. Comrade Xie Tianxiang of the Third Platoon of the Fifth Battalion captured one heavy machine gun. Many of these achievements were planned to be completed in half a year, but were completed at once in this battle. There are also many comrades who obtained rifle bullets, etc., which have not been calculated in detail. Soldiers who have not completed their tasks are working harder, and soldiers who have completed their tasks have made new plans to see who completes their tasks earlier and who exceeds their tasks by more.

　　一战完成半年计划
    烟台二○五部队掀起立功热潮
    【本报讯】“烟台”二○五部队大队、小队、排、班及个人都订出了周密的立功计划，并发起革命竞赛。只在这次文家沟阻击战中，英勇机智的英雄们就为人民立下了这些功劳：七大队四班吴长福同志缴获一挺轻机枪、一支步枪、捉两个俘虏。七大队一班刘春和同志缴了一挺机枪、捉了一个俘虏。八大队一排张宣同志缴了一挺机枪、捉了三个俘虏。八大队五班得了二门小炮、小炮弹十一发、手榴弹六个、两支步枪、三把刺刀，捉了三个俘虏。五大队三排付谢天祥同志，缴获一挺重机枪。这其中有很多是计划半年中完成的，这次一次就完成了。还有好多同志得了步枪子弹等没有详细计算，没有完成任务的战士也更加加油干，完成任务的战士又订出新的计划，看谁的任务完成的早，看谁的任务超过的多。
