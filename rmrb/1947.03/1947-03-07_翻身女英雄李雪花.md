　　The Emancipated Heroine Li Xuehua
Li Xuehua, chairman of the Women's Rescue Association in Pingcheng Township, Lingchuan, is a 19-year-old woman. On February 14th, at the Seventh District's Emancipated Heroes Conference, she spoke in front of so many people for the first time. Here is her self-narration:
　　"My family was poor. At the age of nine, I became a child bride. At fifteen, my father arranged a marriage for me, but after marrying, I suffered countless beatings and scoldings. My husband, Zhang Dazhang, was twelve years older than me. Within a year, he found another woman and sold me to Yang Zhoucun's family for two and a half dou of rice. In the thirty-third year (1944) the Eighth Route Army came. Xiao Ling (a comrade working in the area) saw me wearing very ragged clothes in the village and kept coming to my house to find me, asking if I had any grievances. At that time, I did have grievances: the family that sold me kept all my clothes. I was afraid of things changing, so I said, "No!" Political Commissar Li from the district often talked to me, telling me to express my grievances, denounce the local bullies, and fight the local tyrants. From the fruits of the struggle against the wealthy, I was given a set of clothes to cover my skin, and I realized there was a way to achieve emancipation. The sixth time Comrade Xiao Ling came to call me, I finally signed up for the Peasants' Association…"
　　"…At first, I didn't dare to do it, afraid of making mistakes, and I wasn't good at speaking. Xiao Ling kept talking to me, telling me: "Don't be afraid of making mistakes! I'll stand up for you." The year before last, in March, I was the first to mobilize He Renzhi, who was a very poor widow. As soon as I sat down and said a few words, she said: "Children! I have no grievances. Hurry up and leave!"… One morning, I didn't succeed with two families. In the afternoon, I took some needlework to Zhao Fuxiang's mother's house, doing some sewing while talking, and gathered two or three grievances. After that, whenever I went to a family, I would bring some needlework, and I could gather three or four grievances a day. After running around a lot, poor people started looking for me. Zhang Chouhe had been a farmhand for seventeen years. Last winter, he came to my house and said, "There's no way out!" I said, "Why don't you settle accounts and marry a wife!" My words reminded him, so he settled accounts and got three rooms, five mu of land, a cow's leg, and more than 1,900 yuan, and he married a wife. This time, when supporting the front and sending public grain, he was very happy and said, "I've been emancipated! Let's go."… Qin Taoxiang (female) was a cook, her husband was a farmhand for the local bully Jin Da. He had promised them three rooms. Last November, when sweeping away feudal consciousness, she still didn't dare to mention it. I said to her: "Poor people all over the world are one family. Speak up! I'll lead the women to help you. If you don't hustle (get up and do something) this time, when will you ever get it done?!" After expressing her grievance, she got to live in the rooms and also got three mu of good land. In total, I mobilized five poor families to achieve emancipation.…"
　　"…But my husband couldn't see things clearly, always afraid of me attending meetings. When I returned, he would wear a dark face, either ignoring me or saying: "What kind of meetings are you attending, coming and going like the wind…" I repeatedly advised him, saying: "The Eighth Route Army is here. If we don't achieve emancipation now, when will we?" He was always afraid of "things changing," and even said: "If the Kuomintang army comes, you face it alone, don't involve me"… Later, I found Li Youfu (an activist) to help me break through his thinking, and later he understood. After participating in the emancipation, he was allocated five rooms, seven mu of land, a cow's leg, and more than one shi of grain. Last July, he joined the militia. Now he is very active and doesn't complain about me attending too many meetings anymore."

　　翻身女英雄李雪花
    陵川平城镇妇救会主席李雪花，是个十九岁的青年妇女。二月十四日，七区选举翻身英雄会上，她第一次对着这样多的人发言，下面是她的自述：
    “家里穷，九岁上童养给人家，十五岁上父亲给找下婆家，娶过后挨过无数打骂。男人张大章比我大十二岁，一年功夫人家又找上一个女人，二斗半米把我卖到杨周存家。三十三年八路军过来，小凌（工作同志）在村上看见我穿的很破，一直去家找我，问我有意见没哪。那时咱有意见：卖我的那家把衣裳都扣啦，我怕变天，说“没哪！”区上李政委也常和我谈话，叫提意见诉苦斗恶霸，格（从）斗争老财的果实中给了我一身衣裳，盖住肉皮，我就想到翻身有办法。第六次小凌同志去叫我，我才报名上了农会…………。
    “…………开头我不敢干，怕干错，也不会说话，小凌不断给我谈话，告我：“不怕，干不错！我给你作主。”前年三月，我头一个动员和仁支，她是个很穷的寡妇老婆，刚坐下说了几句，她说：“孩们！我没有哪意见，快走吧！”………………一晌午两家不成功，后晌取上生活（针线）去赵福祥母亲那儿，也做也格扯（谈），收拾了两三个意见。以后，我去那家都要带上生活，一天能收拾三四个意见。跑的多啦，穷人们也找起我来，张丑和当庄稼（长工）十七年，去年冬天去我家说：“没办法！”我说：“你不能表表账，娶上个老婆！”一句话提醒了他，表了账分到三间房，五亩地，一条牛腿，一千九百多块钱，娶上老婆。这回支差送公粮，他很高兴说：“翻了身啦！咱去”。……秦陶香（女）当掌锅，男人当庄稼（长工），恶霸靳大的，承许下给三间房，去年十一月盘茬（扫封建意识）她还是一直不敢提，我对她说：“天下穷人是一家，你提吧！我领导妇女帮助你们，这回不忽沙忽沙（起来干），等到啥时”！？提了意见才住上房，还得了三亩好地。总共加起来，我发动了五家穷人翻身。…………
    “…………可是我男人思想不通，总怕我开会，回去了就黑风着脸，不是不理就是说：“开的是个啥会，风来风去………”我再三劝他说：“八路军来啦，不翻身等到啥时哩？！”他总是怕“变天”，还说：“遭殃军过来你一个人招架吧，不要连累我”………………以后我又找到李有富（积极分子）帮我打通他的思想，后来他想通啦。参加翻身分了五间房，七亩地，一条牛腿，一石多粮食，去年七月参加民兵。现在很积极，也不说我开会多啦。”
