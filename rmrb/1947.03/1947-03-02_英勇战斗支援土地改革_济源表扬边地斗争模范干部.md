    Heroic Fighting Supports Land Reform
    Jiyuan Commends Model Cadres in Border Struggles
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 28th] In the Jiyuan Second District border area, many model cadres have emerged in the guerrilla warfare combined with land reform. The County Command issued a circular on the 10th to commend them. The first model cadre is Comrade Wang Jie, deputy instructor of the district. In late November last year, enemy strongholds were densely established on the south bank of the Mang River, threatening the land reform on the north bank. A few cadres were unwilling to operate on the south bank. Comrade Wang Jie volunteered and led eight militiamen into Ruicun, a "grid network" area, and in one battle defeated more than 30 men of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Fan Dengke's unit, shattering some people's erroneous idea that "it is impossible to operate in the grid network." In more than a month after late November, Comrade Wang Jie led twelve militiamen to fight behind enemy lines thirty times, captured eight regular enemy soldiers, and seized seventy-three members of the "counter-reckoning team," enabling the smooth progress of land reform on the north bank of the Mang River. When the militia lacked clothing, he gave them clothes; when they were sick, he took meticulous care of them. Sharing weal and woe with the militia, Comrade Wang Jie treated the militia like his own brothers, standing guard together, and sleeping on the ground together. The second is Comrade Ding Men. He is the village chief of Nanguanzhuang. In the land reform, he led the masses to divide land during the day, and led the militia to lay mines at night, only getting to sleep in the middle of the night. The next day he would lay mines again before dawn, working hard without complaint. He also often talked with the militia, and the militia were united around him. The third is Comrade Tan Guoquan, the financial and food assistant of the First District Office. On January 3, more than 100 enemies from Yeqiang came to disturb Nanguanzhuang, attempting to sabotage the land reform. He only led more than ten militiamen and successfully resisted the enemy, protecting the interests of the masses. The fourth are Comrades Qu Lixiong and Qu Chengxian. In the Miaodian battle, the enemy charged at them with more than twice their strength. The new militiamen were very frightened, but they bravely took the lead and held off the enemy, killing one enemy and strengthening the confidence of the other militiamen.

　　立功运动中到处出英雄
    英勇战斗支援土地改革
    济源表扬边地斗争模范干部
    【本报太岳二十八日电】济源二区边沿区在游击战争结合土地改革中，涌现出许多模范干部。县指挥部于十日通令表扬。第一名模范干部是区副指导员王杰同志，去年十一月下旬，蟒河南岸敌人据点林立，威胁北岸进行土地改革。少数干部不愿到南岸活动。王杰同志却自报奋勇，带了八个民兵冲入“格子网”瑞村，一战把蒋伪范登科部三十余人击溃。打破了一些人“格子网无法活动”的错误思想。十一月下旬后一个多月中，王杰同志带领十二个民兵驰骋敌后作战三十次，俘敌正规军八名，抓住“倒算队”七十三人，使蟒河北岸土地改革得以顺利进行，民兵缺衣他就送衣，病了，他细心照顾。和民兵共甘苦，王杰同志对民兵如亲兄弟。一块儿站岗放哨、一同睡在地下。第二名是丁门同志。他是南官庄的村长。在土地改革中，他白天领导群众分地，晚上领导民兵埋雷，半夜才能睡觉，第二天天不亮又埋雷，任劳任怨，他又常与民兵谈话，民兵都团结在他的周围。第三名是谭国全同志，一区署财粮助理员。一月三日冶墙敌一百余人出扰南官庄，图破坏土地改革的进行，他只带了十余民兵，就胜利地阻击了敌人，保卫了群众利益。第四名是璩立熊和璩承贤两同志。庙店战斗，敌以超过他们一倍的兵力冲过来，新民兵很恐慌，但他们奋勇当先，把敌人顶住。毙敌一名，坚定了其他民兵的信心。
