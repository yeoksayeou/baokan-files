    Jiluyu Guerrilla Warfare is Entirely Proactive
    Over a Thousand Enemies Annihilated in One Month
    [This newspaper's Jiluyu dispatch on the 21st] The Jiluyu District's guerrilla warfare in February has completely shifted from passive to active, from eliminating local bandits to striking regular Chiang Kai-shek troops. According to incomplete statistics, there were 51 battles in one month, annihilating 1,671 enemies and seizing 32 machine guns and 1,200 rifles and pistols. As the Chiang Kai-shek troops were tight in the front and loose in the rear, and under the dragging and control of our main forces, they were concentrated in one place. Our local armed guerrillas seized their weaknesses and struck them. The enemy's local bandit "homecoming corps" has become a sitting duck. Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops withdrew from Qingfeng, Nanle and other places, the Puyang local bandits dare not leave the city. Our guerrillas have taken root in nearby villages. The masses have risen up to establish joint defense, armed to protect grain and lives. In the Shayu area southwest of Puyang, the enemy only has a few isolated strongholds, and most of the villages are in the hands of our guerrillas. On the 9th, our guerrillas eliminated the strongholds of Danjia and Yinmiao in a two-hour battle, annihilating 200 enemies. On the 22nd, the Xiaoyuzhuang stronghold was eliminated, and another 300 enemies were annihilated. Guerrilla warfare is combined with anti-liquidation and land distribution. For example, in the Yucheng area, grain and land distribution continued to be implemented even after it was invaded by the Chiang Kai-shek troops.

    冀鲁豫游击战完全主动
    一月歼敌千余
    【本报冀鲁豫廿一日电】冀鲁豫区游击战二月份已由被动完全转向主动，由消灭土顽开始转向打击正规蒋军。一个月中据不全统计，共战斗五十一次，歼敌一千六百七十一人，缴获机枪三十二挺，长短枪一千二百枝，由于蒋军前紧后松，在我主力拖拉与控制下，集中于一处，我地方武装游击队抓紧其弱点即予以打击，敌后土顽“还乡队”已成为瓮中之鳖。濮阳土顽自蒋军由清丰南乐等地撤退后，不敢出城，我游击队在附近村庄已扎下根基。群众纷纷起来成立联防，武装保粮保命。濮阳西南沙区一带，敌仅有几个孤立据点，大部村庄在我游击队手中。九日我游击队以二小时战斗，拔除单家、尹庙两据点，歼敌二百。廿二日拔除小于庄据点，又歼其三百。游击战争与反倒算、分田结合起来，如鄄城一带，虽在蒋军侵陷后仍继续贯彻分粮分地。
