Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 22nd: The East China People's Liberation Army is constantly producing examples of strict adherence to mass discipline. When a certain regiment moved to a newly liberated village after the victory in the Laiwu Campaign, it was raining heavily. Shao Zitang, the second platoon leader of the ninth company, negotiated with the residents for housing. All the soldiers in the platoon stood in the rain waiting, without a word of complaint. The guard battalion stopped outside the village to rest, sending cadres into the village first to find suitable accommodations, and then entering in formation. In three days of rapid marching, a certain regiment carried 1,217 loads of water for the masses in the stationed area and cleaned up the area. When the mass discipline inspection team of the regiment's political department sought opinions from the masses, they all said, "Leaving aside everything else, just the fact that the water jars in each household are full and the ground is swept very clean tells us that this army is our own people's." Since the self-defense battle, Zhang Zhengrong's squad of the 30th Detachment of a certain unit has not touched a single vegetable from the masses despite several meals of bland food. During the Zaozhuang battle, when the weather was cold, a soldier borrowed a towel from the masses and returned it immediately after the battle. In the recent Laiwu Campaign, the squad rescued a civilian house in Wangjiadian that had caught fire after being bombed, and after the battle, they helped the people clean up, disregarding their fatigue. As a result, Zhang Zhengrong's squad has been honored with the title of "Model Squad for Mass Discipline." At the same time, all units are able to publicize to a village when stationed in one. A certain regiment publicized the Lu Zhong victory to 1,399 people during three days of marching. The soldiers' propaganda team of the sixth company of a certain regiment performed a flower boat show in the stationed area. It was very popular with the masses, and many companies also used the masses' enthusiasm and past suffering to educate the troops in a timely manner, greatly helping to consolidate and improve mass discipline.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 22nd: Cao Wenxuan, who was liberated from the Chiang army a year ago, was quickly promoted to platoon leader of a certain regiment of the East China People's Liberation Army due to his brave and resourceful combat and his ability to unite comrades. The unit has launched a "Learn from Cao Wenxuan Movement." When he was liberated a year ago, he was initially uneasy due to the influence of Chiang Kai-shek's deceptive propaganda. However, under the enlightenment of the people's army's magnanimous education and the moving facts of the masses' love for the army, he finally changed and fought bravely and tenaciously in numerous battles. Cao received honorary titles such as "Combat Hero and Solidarity Model," "Model Party Member," and "Model Telegraph Operator" in the regiment, and was immediately promoted to his current position. In the Lunan Campaign, he led his entire platoon into a Chiang army stronghold. The enemy's firepower was quite fierce, but he cleverly used stones to build fortifications for the new soldiers, resulting in very few casualties. In ordinary times, he put himself in the shoes of the new liberated soldiers and enlightened and educated them day and night, resulting in the transformation of some backward soldiers. All the soldiers in the platoon were united around him. In the past eight months, no one had deserted, and their combat morale and confidence were extremely high. Currently, 200 heroes and models in the regiment are humbly learning from him, and the movement is being promoted and expanded.

    华东人民解放军群众纪律严明
    【新华社华东前线二十二日电】华东人民解放军中不断涌现严格执行群众纪律的范例。某团于莱芜战役胜利后移驻布告解放之某村时，正遇大雨，九连二排长邵子堂与居民交涉住屋，全排战士站在雨地等待，无一怨言。警卫营则停在庄外休息，派干部先进村找好住处，然后整队而入。某团于三天快速行军中仍为驻地群众担水一二一七担，并打扫清洁。该团政治处群众纪律检查组向群众征求意见时，他们都说：“不说别的，单就各家缸水满口，地扫的非常干净，就晓得这队伍是俺老百姓自己的了。”某部队三十支队张正荣班自卫战以来，数餐淡食未动群众一菜。枣庄战斗时，天气寒冷，一战士向群众借一块毛巾，战后立即送还。此次莱芜战役，该班抢救王家店被炸起火之民房，战后又不顾疲劳帮助老百姓打扫清洁，因之张正荣班已荣膺“群众纪律模范班”的称号。同时各部队均能贯彻到一村宣传一村，某团行军三天向一三九九人宣传了鲁中大捷情形，某团六连战士宣传组在驻地玩花船宣传。大受群众欢迎，许多连队更及时以群众热情与痛苦反转来教育部队，大大帮助了群众纪律的巩固与提高。
    【新华社华东前线二十二日电】一年前自蒋军中被解放过来的曹文选，由于作战英勇机智，善于团结战友，迅速被提升为华东人民解放军某团排长，该部队并掀起“学习曹文选运动”。当他一年前被解放时，由于受蒋介石欺骗宣传影响，开始情绪不安，但在人民军队宽大教育及群众热爱部队的动人事实启发下，终于转变，屡次战斗英勇顽强。曹在团内获得战斗英勇团结模范、模范党员、模范电报通讯员等荣誉称号，立被提升任现职。鲁南战役中他率全排突入蒋军据点，敌人火力颇猛，他机智的用石块为新战士垒起掩体，以致伤亡极微。平时他根据自己的体念将心比心，昼夜对新解放战士启发教育，结果使一些落后战士得到改造；全排战士都团结在他周围，八个月来无一人离队，战斗情绪与信心异常高涨。现该团二百位英雄模范均虚心向他学习，并正将此运动推广展开中。
