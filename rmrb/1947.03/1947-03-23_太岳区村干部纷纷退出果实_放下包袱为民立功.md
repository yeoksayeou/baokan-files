    Village Cadres in the Taiyue Region Voluntarily Return Illicit Gains
    Shed Burdens to Serve the People and Achieve Merit

    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Taiyue, 21st] In Changzi, Jincheng, Yangcheng, Wangwu, and other counties, cadres are responding to the call of the District Party Committee during the review process and are voluntarily returning illicit gains. District cadres are taking the lead in setting a model, conducting serious self-criticism, and promoting village cadres' voluntary return of excessive gains, undervalued purchases, and privately received benefits. All district cadres in the Fifth District of Changzi voluntarily returned undervalued and excessive gains such as buildings, livestock, and bedding within five days. The exemplary role of the district cadres has promoted self-examination among the cadres in various villages: "Are we detached from the masses? Are the masses satisfied with us? How can we be good cadres? What does it really mean to serve the masses?" These questions have triggered intense ideological struggles among the cadres, and the idea of serving the masses has finally triumphed over selfish thoughts. He Jin, chairman of the Bao Village Farmers' Association, and the group leader voluntarily returned 30 pieces of clothing and said with relief, "In the past, I couldn't break through my selfishness. Whenever the masses held meetings, I was afraid of being criticized. Now that I've shed the burden, I can wholeheartedly serve the masses and achieve more merit." In six villages, including Beiyang, Tiancun, and Yaotou in the Second District of Wangwu, there were still 71 extremely poor households and 497 poor peasant households that had not received land. Because the village cadres voluntarily returned more than 2,800 mu of land obtained illicitly, the goal of "land to the tiller" has been fully realized. After this step in the district, extreme poverty has been completely eliminated, and 71 percent of poor peasants have been lifted out of poverty. Han Hong, vice chairman of the Dongdayang Town Farmers' Association in Jincheng, also returned seven livestock and 73 mu of land obtained illicitly. In Gulong Village, Yangcheng, the practice of distributing the illicit gains returned by cadres to poor military families has further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. The masses therefore further realized that village cadres are truly considering the masses in everything they do, and they support the cadres even more. When Bao Village formally established its Farmers' Association, the masses still elected He Jin as the chairman of the Farmers' Association.

    太岳区村干部纷纷退出果实
    放下包袱为民立功
    【本报太岳廿一日电】长子、晋城、阳城、王屋等县干部在复查中响应区党委号召，纷纷退出多得果实。区干部首起模范作用，进行严肃的自我批评，推动了村干部自退多得、贱买、私受果实。长子五区全体区干部在五天内自动退出贱买和多得的楼房、牲口、被褥等。区干部的模范作用推动了各村干部的自我检讨：“咱们是否脱离群众？群众对咱们是否满意？怎样当一个好干部？怎样才算真正为群众服务？”这些问题引起干部剧烈的思想斗争，为群众服务的思想终于战胜了自私的思想。鲍村农会主席何金和小组长自动退出卅件衣服后，轻松的说：“过去私心没打破，群众一开会，就怕人家议论，这次放下包袱后，可以歇心为群众再立功了”。王屋二区北阳、田村、瑶头等六个村，尚有赤贫七十一户，贫农四百九十七户没有得到土地，由于村干部自动退出多得土地二千八百多亩，已完满实现耕者有其田。该区经过这一步骤，赤贫完全消灭，贫农消灭百分之七十一。晋城东大阳镇农会副主席韩洪等也退出多得牲口七个、土地七十三亩。阳城固隆村则以干部退出多得果实分配给贫苦军属的办法，进一步密切了干群关系，群众因此进一步认识村干部真是处处为群众打算，更拥护干部。鲍村在正式成立农会时，群众仍然选举了何金为农会主席。
