    Taihang Paper Mill Workers Voluntarily Reduce Salaries and Dedicate Labor
    [This newspaper's dispatch] In addition to production competitions, Taihang Paper Mill workers are now launching a salary reduction and labor dedication movement. Ning Chaoxi, a worker in the first branch factory, voluntarily offered to do five days of voluntary labor each month, saying, "Dedicating labor is just like going to the front lines." Workers have been actively dedicating labor, with a total of forty-seven people dedicating a total of two hundred and ninety workdays from March to August 1st. Cadres Li Wenying and eight others have reduced their monthly salaries by forty-four workdays, donating over 30,000 yuan. Chen Shi, a worker in the second branch factory, proposed doing seven days of voluntary labor each month. A total of sixty-nine people have dedicated one hundred and forty-three workdays each month, and more than 10,000 yuan in silver dollars. Eleven cadres have reduced their salaries by fifty-three workdays each month. The third branch factory is also keeping up, with a total of seventy-five people dedicating three hundred and twenty-two workdays each month. In total, the three branch factories have dedicated two thousand six hundred and sixty-five workdays over five months. Cadres at the factories and purchasing stations have reduced their salaries by a total of one hundred and four workdays. Valued at 244 yuan per workday, or 300 yuan per workday, this is worth a total of 1,022,950 yuan in silver dollars (from March to August 1st). Other purchasing stations and the repair factory are continuing to respond.
