　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Beiping, 2nd – One hundred and ninety-two professors from five universities in Beiping, including Yenching, Tsinghua, and Peking Universities, led by Professor Zhao Zichen of Yenching University, issued a letter of protest. They echoed the previous declaration of human rights protection by thirteen professors, demanding the immediate release of the more than two thousand innocent citizens who were illegally arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents last month, and opposed the "police district system" implemented by the Chiang-controlled Beiping Police Bureau, which deprives people of their freedom.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: United Press, Beiping, 28th – Due to protests from university students and various sectors of society against the recent mass arrests of people, the Kuomintang authorities in Beiping have further strengthened censorship of Chinese newspapers, and issued a notice to all newspapers that they are only allowed to publish Central News Agency reports regarding the activities of university students. Foreign residents generally do not know what the arrests and student protests are about, because the only English newspaper in Beiping, the Peking Chronicle, which is run by the Kuomintang, has not published a single word about it.

　　北平五大学百余教授
    抗议蒋特非法捕人
    【新华社延安八日电】北平二日讯：平市燕京、清华、北京等五大学教授一九二人，由燕大赵紫宸教授领衔，发表抗议书，响应前此十三教授之保障人权宣言，要求立即释放上月横遭蒋特非法逮捕之二千余无辜市民，并反对平市蒋记警察局实施剥夺人民自由之“警管区制”。
    【新华社延安六日电】美联社北平二十八日电：平市国民党当局因大学生及各界抗议最近大肆逮捕人民，已进一步加强检查中文报纸，并通令各报对于各大学学生动态，仅准刊载中央社消息。一般外侨均不知逮捕及学生抗议的情形如何，因平市唯一英文报纸仅国民党所办之北平纪事报，迄无只字刊载。
