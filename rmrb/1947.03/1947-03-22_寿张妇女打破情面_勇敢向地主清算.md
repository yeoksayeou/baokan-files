    Shouzhang Women Break Through Sentimentality and Bravely Liquidate Landlords
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Jilu Yu on the 20th] Women in the first and second districts of Shouzhang County are enthusiastically participating in land reform. In Xiyintang, District One, when liquidating landlords, women broke through their sentimental feelings for the landlords and were even braver than men in moving floating wealth. Women accounted for two-thirds of the turned-over heroes elected in the two villages. Wang He Shi in District Two, 25 years old, whose family had six mu of land and four people, had begged for food for two years in the past. When the village was clearing the landlord's floating wealth, the landlord's women secretly carried bundles and ran away. When she saw it, she immediately chased after them and snatched them back. She said, "I've been keeping an eye on this for a long time." When turning over the landlord Wang Cunx's grain, others dared not go down to the cellar, but she went down and found a pile of grain. Because the village cadres of × Village were controlled by the landlord, the members of the peasant association did not dare to say anything, but under the leadership of the women of Yuan Tingyu's family, they first held a meeting to discuss the targets of struggle, and the women took the lead. Under their influence, the peasant association also began to move. The women then proposed to establish a land liquidation committee. After everyone agreed, they elected members separately. Women accounted for seven of the fifteen members.

    寿张妇女打破情面
    勇敢向地主清算
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】寿张县一、二区妇女踊跃参加土地改革。一区西影唐在向地主清算时，妇女打破了对地主的情面，搬浮财比男人还勇敢。在两村选举的翻身英雄中，妇女占三分之二。二区王何氏，二十五岁，全家六亩地，四口人，过去曾要过二年饭，村上清理地主浮财时，地主的妇女偷背着包袱跑，她看到后马上追上去，夺回来。她说：“我早留心啦。”在翻地主王存×的粮食时，别人不敢下地窖，她下去了，结果找到一囤粮食。×村因村干受地主掌握，农会会员也不敢吭，可是在袁庭玉家的妇女带头下，首先开会讨论了斗争对象，妇女们先动起来。农会在她们影响下，也动起来了。妇女又提出建立土地清算委员会，大家同意后即分别选举委员，十五个委员中妇女占了七人。
