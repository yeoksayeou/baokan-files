　　Correction
    According to a telegram from Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an, in the battle northwest of Wenshui County (published in this newspaper on the 7th) it was mistakenly reported that "Yan's army's 72nd Division Deputy Division Commander Wang Weizhen was captured alive, and Division Commander Ai Ziqian barely escaped." The correct information is: "Division Commander Ai Ziqian and the wounded Deputy Division Commander Wang Weizhen led the remaining 300-plus troops and fled." We hereby issue this correction.

　　更正
    据延安新华社来电，五日所播文水城西北战斗（载七日本报）中“生俘阎军七十二师副师长王维桢师长艾子谦仅以身免”系“师长艾子谦及负伤之副师长王维桢，率残部三百余人逃走”之误。特此更正。
