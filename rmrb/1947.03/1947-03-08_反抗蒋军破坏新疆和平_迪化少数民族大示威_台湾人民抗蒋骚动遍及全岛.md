Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 6th: According to news from Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province, nearly a thousand Uyghurs and Kazakhs in Dihua city twice marched on the 19th and 25th of last month and surrounded the provincial government to petition, making dozens of demands. The demands particularly emphasized reducing the number of Kuomintang troops in southern Xinjiang, accusing them of undermining peace in Xinjiang and disrupting people's lives. During the parade, more than a hundred Kazakhs rode horses at the front, holding large banners of petition, and the队伍 shouted slogans along the way.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 6th: According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 5th, a large-scale uprising by the people of Taiwan against the tyrannical rule of the Chiang government has spread across the island. A Central News Agency report quoted Peng Xuepei on the 5th, who also admitted that the uprising had affected Kaohsiung in the southern part of the province and major cities along the railway line running north and south. From Keelung in the north to Kaohsiung in the south, including the provincial capital Taipei and the cities of Hsinchu, Taichung, and Tainan, the people have been swept up in this wave of anger. TASS stated that since the incident broke out on the 28th of last month, all transportation between Taiwan and the mainland has been cut off. The Taiwanese people's uprising is due to their inability to tolerate the Chiang government's dark police district system, the monopoly of important economic sectors, and the behavior of corrupt officials. The people in the uprising have demanded that the Chiang government punish the offending police, abolish the monopoly, appoint local people's leaders as administrative heads to establish an autonomous government, and lift restrictions on local students serving in public office. Reuters reported that the Taiwan People's Association in Shanghai also demanded on the 4th that Chiang Kai-shek immediately reform politics and give the Taiwanese people enlightened treatment.
