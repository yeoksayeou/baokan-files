    Local Armed Guerrilla Forces in Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    Universally Assist the Masses to Overthrow Their Oppressors
    [Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch, 19th] The local armed forces in various districts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and the guerrilla forces in the Jiang-occupied areas have universally launched a movement of holding a gun in one hand and assisting peasants to completely overthrow their oppressors with the other. Troops in the central districts are going deep into the countryside to mobilize the masses to actively participate in land reform. Troops in the border areas are both covering and mobilizing the masses for joint defense, and carrying out land distribution. Troops in the recovered areas are assisting the masses in retaliating against traitors and recovering land. Guerrilla forces in the Jiang-occupied areas are helping the masses to carry out counter-liquidation. After a large detachment of the Seventh Sub-district went deep into the countryside, it clearly put forward the slogan, saying to the poor peasants: "If the poor want to overthrow their oppressors, they must divide the land." Within seven days, it helped three villages carry out land reform, enabling 90 households (460 people) of poor peasants to obtain land. The Yunbei Detachment of the Second Sub-district, while carrying out intensive training, formed resident village work groups, dispersed to various villages, and visited poor peasants to mobilize struggle. The troops of the Sixth Sub-district first attacked key villages. After the directly subordinate team of the sub-district entered Dong'a and Dongwangshan villages, which were known as "feudal fortresses," it immediately mobilized the masses to deliberate. In five days, it broke the deadlock and exposed a large amount of land and floating wealth of landlords. The Taixi local armed forces in the border areas are both suppressing bandits and helping the people to distribute land, and put forward "The troops resolutely help the people to overthrow their oppressors." Now, the situation has been broken in ten large villages in Ningyang, and land reform has been initially completed in some villages in Changqing. The directly subordinate team of the Eighth Sub-district helped the masses in the recovered areas to retaliate against traitors, doing specific propaganda, education, and investigation work, and supporting the masses with practical actions. For example, when some bad landlords in Xiaoshizi Village attempted to restore their rule when the Jiang troops arrived, forcing the members of the peasant association to ask where public property was deposited, the detachment immediately detained them. The masses rose up to settle accounts with the bad landlords, and their emotions were extremely high. They said, "In the past, you helped us struggle, and today you are helping us to take revenge. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, we would never be able to get our land and property back in our lifetime." The Linze Detachment of the Second Sub-district supported the masses in counter-liquidation behind enemy lines. A bad landlord in × Village once forced the masses to repay one and return three. The detachment detained him, and the masses immediately demanded the landlord return 2,200 catties of grain. The armed forces of the Seventh Sub-district are both attacking enemy and puppet forces in the vicinity of Jining and carrying out land distribution. In just four days from February 8th to 11th, they annihilated more than 60 enemies and mobilized peasants in three villages to rise up and divide the land.

    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】冀鲁豫各区地方武装及在蒋占区的游击队普遍展开一手持枪，一手扶持农民大翻身运动。中心区部队深入农村，发动群众积极参加土地改革。边沿区部队一面掩护和发动群众联防，一面进行分田。收复区部队扶持群众反奸复仇，收回土地。蒋占区游击队则帮助群众进行反倒算。七分区一大队深入农村后，即明确提出口号，对贫农说：“穷人要翻身，就要把地分。”七天内帮助三个村进行土地改革，使九十户（四百六十口）贫农得到土地。二分区郓北大队一面突击整训，一面组成驻村工作组，分散各村，访问贫苦农民发动斗争。六分区部队先打重点村，分区直属队进入素称“封建堡垒”的东阿、东旺山村后，即发动群众酝酿，五天就轰开了局面，斗出地主大批土地浮财。边沿区泰西地方武装一面剿匪，一面帮助老百姓分田，并提出“部队坚决帮助老百姓翻身。”现宁阳已有十个大村轰开局面，长清亦有部分村子初步完成土地改革。八分区直属队帮助收复区群众进行反奸复仇，做具体宣传教育调查等工作，并用实际行动给群众撑腰。如小什字村部分坏地主在蒋军到来时，企图恢复统治，逼问农会会员公家资财寄放处，分直部队当即加以拘押，群众纷起与坏地主算账，情绪极高。他们说：“过去你们帮俺斗争，今天又帮俺报仇，不是共产党八路军，俺的土地财物一辈子也回不了家。”二分区临泽大队在敌后扶持群众反倒算。×庄坏蛋地主曾强迫群众倒一还三，该队将其拘押，群众当即向地主要回粮食二千二百斤。七分区武装在济宁近郊一面打击敌伪，一面进行分田。仅二月八日至十一日四天中，即歼敌六十余人，并发动三个村农民起来分田。
