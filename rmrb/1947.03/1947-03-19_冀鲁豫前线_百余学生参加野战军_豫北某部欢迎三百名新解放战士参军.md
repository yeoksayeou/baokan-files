　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Frontline
    Over a Hundred Students Join the Field Army
    A Unit in Northern Henan Welcomes Three Hundred Newly Liberated Soldiers to Join the Army
    [This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Frontline dispatch, 17th] The Political Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Self-Defense Frontline Field Army has recently assigned one hundred and twenty-four political and cultural work cadres, who have been training for three months, and thirty-five university students who have just joined the army from Northern University and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Institute of Architecture, to combat troops in response to the call to "Defend Yan'an." These one hundred and twenty-four trainees were all middle school students from areas such as Juye and Yuncheng before Jiang's army occupied them last year. Because they could not bear the trampling of Jiang's army, they rose up to join the army. They achieved excellent results in their three months of study. When they heard the call of the emergency mobilization meeting to defend Yan'an, they all enthusiastically requested to immediately rush to the front line to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service.
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 17th] The "Lushan" unit on the Northern Henan front line held a meeting on the 1st of this month in its station to welcome three hundred newly liberated soldiers (i.e., Jiang's army soldiers captured in the self-defense war) to join the army. All the leaders of the unit personally participated. At the meeting, Chief of Staff × called on the newly liberated soldiers to learn from Wang Keqin. In the speeches of the liberated soldiers who joined the army, Yang Jitang, a soldier of the 32nd Division of Jiang's army, swore to join the People's Liberation Army and avenge the people and himself. Guo Yuehe, a young soldier who had just been liberated from the Juye battlefield, tearfully recounted how he was oppressed when he was captured by Jiang's bandits to serve as a soldier. He said that his mother was beaten by Jiang's army and is still unable to move. He swore to avenge his mother and defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. In the free speeches, old soldiers liberated from the Pinghan and Shangdang campaigns spoke, condemning the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan.
