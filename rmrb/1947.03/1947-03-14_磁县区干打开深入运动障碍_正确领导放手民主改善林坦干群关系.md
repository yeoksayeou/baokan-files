[This report from our newspaper in the Taihang Mountains, dated the 12th] After Cixian County's Lintan Village rectified its cadres and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, it thoroughly liquidated the landlords. During the land redistribution movement, village chief Wang Keliang and more than ten other cadres sheltered landlords. Fourteen landlord families were not thoroughly liquidated. For example, the landlord Wang Shuangui (family of four) still retained nine mu of good irrigated land, while the poor military dependents only received distant and poor land. When the military dependents raised objections, the cadres retorted, "You're complaining about bland salt, aren't you?" The distribution of the harvest was not unified according to need, but was sold at a price; whoever had money could buy it, and the poor peasants and farm laborers who had no money could not turn over a new leaf. Women who participated in the struggle were also dissatisfied because they did not receive any fruits of their labor, and the cadres even thought, "It doesn't matter if she's there or not." The cadres, however, divided up the harvest in large and good portions, and used the harvest to open grain shops for private production. As a result, the masses developed resentment toward the cadres, and the movement fell into decline. After the district cadres conducted an in-depth investigation and discovered this problem, they first rectified the cadres under the slogan of "unity against the enemy." The methods were: on the one hand, to support the masses and allow them to vent their opinions of the cadres as much as possible; on the other hand, to enlighten the cadres' class consciousness and persuade them to wash their faces and wipe away the black marks with the masses, and to return the excess harvest they had divided. At first, the masses all said, "We dare not offer opinions, because after you (the district cadres) leave, the cadres will retaliate!" The district cadres repeatedly stated, "It's guaranteed nothing will happen." The masses then brewed their thoughts in groups of three or five, until more than two hundred masses rose up to give opinions to the cadres, with great anger. Seeing that the masses were truly rising up and had the determination to wash their faces and wipe away the black marks, but also having concerns about "fear of being dragged out and beaten, fear of losing face," the district cadres again assured them, "As long as you thoroughly reflect, the masses will forgive you," and the cadres were also relieved. After both sides were prepared, a mass meeting of more than five hundred people was convened. Village Chief Wang Keliang placed the harvest he had taken too much of in the meeting place, thoroughly reviewed his various mistakes, and felt so sorry that he burst into tears. Under his influence, ten cadres all made self-criticisms and returned the excess harvest on the spot. The anger of the masses quickly subsided, and they unanimously said, "That's right." Wang Fuying, chairman of the farmers' association (who had been a puppet soldier, puppet police officer, puppet village chief, and puppet secret agent), and two other bad cadres were dismissed after discussion by the masses. As for the village chief and other cadres, the masses believed that although they had made mistakes, they also had merits, so they approved of them continuing to be cadres. The masses said, "Good and bad must be distinguished." When two truly poor cadres wanted to return the excess harvest, the masses unanimously declined. In resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, special agents attempted to take the opportunity to strike down the cadres and take the stage themselves, pretending to be active and falsely accusing "the cadres of embezzling seven hundred catties of wheat." When they were exposed by the masses, who said, "Tell the truth, don't make up lies!" The special agents were also exposed. The cadres were even more grateful, saying, "The masses have sharp eyes, they can distinguish between good and bad, they are not fighting us, they are saving us." In this way, the "knot" between cadres and the masses was easily resolved, and then new cadres were elected. Although the problem was solved, there were still some gaps in the thinking of the new and old cadres. The new cadres said, "We have offered opinions to them, and we are always afraid that they will be dissatisfied with us." The old cadres said, "Having made such a big mistake, can we still lead the masses in the future?" After the district cadres discovered this, they convened a forum for the new and old cadres. First, the old cadres made another self-criticism: "We were wrong in the past, and everyone's criticism was correct. If we were not criticized, we would be dead! We must do a good job in the future." The new cadres said, "We have little experience, and we will learn from you in the future." Everyone was very united and unanimously expressed that they would wash their faces and wipe away the black marks diligently in the future. After the new leadership group was established, it quickly launched a major struggle against the special agents and landlords.

　　磁县区干打开深入运动障碍
    正确领导放手民主改善林坦干群关系
    群众眼睛亮好坏分得清
    坏干部予以撤换好干部批准继任
    【本报太行十二日电】磁县林坦村经过改造干部，密切干群关系后、彻底清算地主。该村填补运动中，村长王克良等十余干部，包庇地主。十四户地主均未彻底清算。如地主王双贵（四口人）仍留下九亩好水地，而贫苦军属反只分得远地坏地。军属提意见，干部反说：“白吃盐还嫌淡吗？”果实分配，不是统一按需要分，而是作价出卖，谁有钱谁买，没有钱的贫雇农都没翻身。妇女参加斗争，没得到果实也不满意，干部还认为：“有她没她不碍事”。干部们却分得又多又好，并拿果实开粮店作私人生产。因此，群众对干部结下了“圪塔”，运动陷于消沉。经区干部深入检查发现此问题后，在“团结对外”的口号下，首先改造干部。办法是：一方面给群众撑腰尽量发泄对干部意见；一面启发干部阶级觉悟，劝说他们向群众洗脸擦黑，退出多分果实。开始群众都说：“可不敢提意见，你们（区干部）走了，干部就要报复！”区干部再三表明说：“保险没事”。群众便三三五五的酝酿，一直到二百余群众起来给干部提意见，火气很大。干部见群众真正起来，有了洗脸擦黑的决心，但又产生“怕拖打、怕丢人”的顾虑，区干部又作保证：“只要彻底反省，群众是会原谅的”，干部也安心了。双方都有了准备后，就召开了五百多人的群众大会，村长王克良把自己多拿的果实摆在会场，彻底检讨了自己的各种错误，自感抱歉、便大哭起来。在他影响下，十个干部都做了检讨，并当场退出多分的果实，群众火气很快松下，一致说：“这就对了”。农会主席王福英（当过伪军、伪警察、伪村长、伪密探）等三个坏干部经群众讨论，予以撤职。其次村长等干部，群众认为他们虽有错误，但也有功劳，所以批准仍当干部，群众说：“好坏要分清”。有两个真正贫苦干部要退多分果实，群众齐声谢绝。在解决干群关系中，特务分子曾企图乘机打下干部，自己登台，假装积极，诬说“干部贪污麦子七百斤”。当被群众揭露：“该怎是怎，反被抓瞎话！”特务分子也被澄出。干部更感激的说：“群众眼睛亮，好坏分得清，不是斗咱，是救了咱。”这样，干群“圪瘩”遂迎刃而解，接着就选举了新干部。问题虽然解决，但新老干部思想上总还有些隔阂，新干部说：“咱给人家提了意见，总怕不满咱”。老干部说：“犯了这大错误，今后还能领导群众哩”。区干部发现后，便召开了新老干部座谈会，首先老干部再做检讨：“过去错了，大家提的对，如果不提，将来我们是死路一条！今后一定要好好干”。新干部说：“俺们经验少，以后要跟你们学习”。大家十分团结，一致表示今后要勤洗脸、勤擦黑。新的领导集团建立后，迅即展开了对特务地主的大斗争。
