    Taihang Fifth Administrative Region Decides to Clear Accounts, Clear Inventory, and Rectify Wartime Service
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Taihang Fifth Administrative Region convened a meeting of the heads of finance and food departments of various counties on the 3rd of this month to inspect and arrange future financial, food, and wartime service work. Regarding food supply work, the meeting reviewed the past tendency of prioritizing finance over food and the lax management of grain, which led to partial spoilage of grain and instances of embezzlement and concealment by individual cadres. It was decided to thoroughly clear inventory and accounts. The method is: responsible comrades at all levels should first examine themselves and promote all cadres to form a mass movement of clearing, and establish reward measures. Regarding local finance, this year it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of county funds raised by the county and village funds raised by the village for self-sufficiency in production. Except for Anyang, Tangyin, Jiqi, and counties, Lin, She, Ciwu, and other counties must strive to completely eliminate direct levies. Generally, solutions should be found through transportation, gathering firewood, etc. It is strictly forbidden to waste resources on village banquets and excessive eating and drinking, which must be approved by the county district when necessary. Regarding wartime service and corvée labor issues, the meeting identified problems such as the waste of manpower and the small scope of corvée labor burdens in the past. In some villages, the burden of labor was less than half of the total labor force. For example, in Nanyi Village, out of 130 laborers, 70 did not perform corvée labor. To overcome these shortcomings, it was decided to implement a work-point reward system. Half-laborers, old liberated area cadres, and militia members are all required to perform corvée labor (attending meetings and training in districts and counties also counts as work). Corvée labor, participation in combat, and production are all recorded as work points. Large-scale work exchanges are implemented on the basis of mutual aid, to minimize or avoid hindering production. To implement the above-mentioned financial, food, and wartime service work, Lin County has already convened a training class for more than 500 cadres, and other counties will convene cadres to study and deploy [these measures].

    太行五专署决定清账清仓整顿战勤
    【本报讯】太行五专署于本月三日召开各县财粮科长会议，检查并布置今后财粮、战勤工作。在粮秣工作上，检讨了过去的重财轻粮的观点与对粮食管理松懈，以致粮食部分腐烂、及个别干部贪污、埋伏等现象，决定彻底清仓、清账，办法是：各级负责同志首先检讨自己、推动全体干部，形成群众性的清理运动，并定出奖励办法。关于地方财政，今年要继续贯彻县款县筹，村款村筹生产自给方针。除安阳、汤阴、汲淇、县外，林、涉、磁武，等县均须争取全部免除直接派征。一般以运输、拾砍、打柴等生产来解决。严禁村中烟酒招待和大吃大喝等浪费现象，必要时，须经县区批准。关于战勤工作与差务问题，检查出过去的民力浪费、差役负担面小等问题。有些村劳力负担面尚不及全劳力的二分之一。如南邑全村劳力一百三十个，就有七十个不支差。为克服这些毛病，决定实行记工奖工制。组织半劳力，老区干部民兵一律支差（到区县开会受训也顶工），支差、参战、生产都记工。在互助基础上实行大变工。做到少妨害或不妨害生产。为贯彻上述财粮及战勤工作，林县已召开五百多干部的训练班，其他各县均将召集干部研究布置。（向明）
