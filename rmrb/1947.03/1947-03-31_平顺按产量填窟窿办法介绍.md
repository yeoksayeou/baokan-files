Introduction to the Ping Shun Method of Filling Gaps According to Output
    Collected and Organized by Wang Julin Through Collective Study

    The Dou Village in the Third District of Ping Shun created a method of distributing land according to population and output, which was widely adopted in the land reform movement last winter. The advantage of this method is that the standard is clear, and it is easy to check the gaps. In the past, when discussing the distribution of fruits, it was often said that so-and-so was not good enough and should be given something. Exactly how they "should" be given was not specific or clear enough. If the distribution is based on population and output, one can see how many people there are, the average land output per person, and know how much should be filled. At the same time, this method can also avoid certain cadres from engaging in favoritism. This method is especially suitable for areas where land quality varies greatly. However, it should be noted that Ping Shun, as an old area, has a long-term working foundation, and the assessment of the base amount of special burden work is relatively true and fair. If this method is used in new areas or old areas where grain production assessment is still poor, it needs to be studied and considered. The following is a brief introduction to this method for reference:

  I. Determining Standards
    Before distributing the fruits, the first thing to do is to determine the standard for land distribution. Let the masses discuss how to distribute it and what is fair and reasonable? Naturally, it will be pointed out that land varies in distance, fertility, and barrenness, and it must be distributed according to output to be reasonable, otherwise, "irreconcilable conflicts" will occur. In this way, the principle is passed, and then the standard is determined based on the average population and land output of the whole village. For example, in Kou Village, the average land per person is 3.9 mu, and the output is 6.3 shi. The distribution is based on this standard. Before the distribution, the average land per person for landlords in the village was 4.36 mu, and the output was 10 shi; the average land per person for rich peasants was 4.2 mu, and the output was 9.33 shi; the average land per person for upper-middle peasants was 4.46 mu, and the output was 9.5 shi; the average land per person for middle peasants was 2.96 mu, and the output was 6.66 shi; the average land per person for new middle peasants was 3.74 mu, and the output was 4.087 shi; the average land per person for poor peasants was 2.24 mu, and the output was 3.066 shi; the average land per person for very poor peasants was 1.45 mu, and the output was 0.73 shi. After the distribution, the average land per person for very poor peasants was 2.76 mu, and the output was 6.1 shi. The best land was used to fill the gaps. The average land per person for poor peasants was 2.71 mu, and the output was 5.6 shi, which also filled the gaps. The average land per person for new middle peasants was 2.72 mu, and the output was 5.71 shi. Although the land was not as large as the original average, it was exchanged for good land, and the output increased by 1.7 shi. The average land per person for middle peasants was 3.13 mu, and the output was 6.87 shi. The average land per person for upper-middle peasants was 4.26 mu, and the output was 9.32 shi (because the rent of the pawned land was less, the grain output was two dou). This proves that the interests of the middle peasants were not harmed.

    If you encounter a poor village with small tails and large gaps, you can only lower the distribution standard, and you must never harm the interests of the middle peasants. For example, in Zi Ling Village in the Third District, the landlords did not have much land left. The average land per person in the village was 1.7 mu, and the output was 4 shi. They had to lower the standard to 1.4 mu of land with an output of more than 3 shi for distribution. During the distribution, those who did not meet the standard were supplemented, and those who exceeded the standard were not distributed. In short, this method is a balancing act for filling gaps, not a comprehensive leveling act.

  II. Several Points to Consider During Distribution
    According to this standard, in addition to giving priority to filling the gaps for revolutionary martyrs and their families, and the very poor, many details need to be taken into account. For example, the issue of caring for orphans, widows, and bachelors. In the distribution, we often encounter old bachelors who are very poor. This should be taken care of during the distribution. For example, in Shi Cheng, when distributing land to bachelors, each person was allocated land as if they were one and a half people in preparation for marriage, etc. For households with a large population and few means of production, if the average output is less by one or two dou, they will no longer be supplemented. In terms of caring for mountain products and specialties, the principle is that every family has them, but if a piece of land is divided and the harvest of specialties is relatively large, those whose average output is slightly worse will not be supplemented. The main thing is to take care of good or bad, distant or near land. This adjustment is very important. For example, Ma Fu Kui, a poor peasant in Black Tiger Village, originally had 18 mu of distant and bad land. During the distribution, he was given 8 mu of good and near land. Generally, priority is given to adjusting the land for revolutionary martyrs and their families to be near and good, so that it is convenient for them to cultivate and for the masses to cultivate on their behalf.

  III. Specific Method of Distribution According to Output
    Distribution according to output is mainly based on the account of the output of the land under burden. The average number of people, land, and output of the whole village is announced. After that, the gap households of the masses or the appraisal committee selected by the farmers' association, combined with the original turn-over committee and cadres, jointly appraise the output household by household. The appraisal results are announced in the farmers' association and passed by the masses before distribution. In this way, the standard is clear, and the leadership is combined with the masses. The distribution is very fair and reasonable, and a mass management of fruit distribution can be formed.

    平顺按产量填窟窿办法介绍
    集体研究王巨林整理
    平顺三区豆村创造了按人口产量平均分配的办法，在去冬的土地改革运动中被广泛采用。他的好处是标准明显，容易检查窟窿，过去分果实讨论中，往往说谁谁不行，应该分，究竟他怎样“应该”就不够具体明显，若按人口产量分配，一看几口人每口平均土地产量，就知道应该填多少，同时这种办法，也可避免某些干部绚私。这种办法尤其在土地质量好坏悬殊的地区最为适合，但这里附带说明的是因平顺老区他有多年的工作基础，特别负担工作的基础量评议较真实公平，若在新区或产粮评议尚差的老区，这种办法的使用就需要研究考虑。兹将这种办法扼要介绍如下，供各地参考：
  一、确定标准
    在分果实之前，首先要确定分土地的标准，让群众讨论如何分？怎样公平合理？自然就会提出土地有远近肥瘠之分，必须按产量才能合理，否则就会发生“撕扯不开”的困难。这样来通过原则，再以全村人口平均，土地产量确定标准，如口村每口平均土地三九亩产量六·三石，就根据这个标准来填窟窿。该村在分配以前，地主每口平均土地四·三六亩，产量一○石，富农每口平均四·二亩，产量九·三三石，富中每口平均四·四六亩，产量九·五石，中农每口平均二·九六亩产量六·六六石，新中每口平均土地三·七四亩产量四·○八七石，贫农每口平均二·二四亩，产量三·○六六石，赤贫每口平均土地一·四五亩，产量○·七三石。分配以后，赤贫每口平均土地二·七六亩，产量六·一石，分配上最好土地填起了窟窿，贫农每口平均土地二·七一亩，产量五·六石，亦补齐了窟窿。新中农每口平均土地二·七二亩，产量五·七一石，地虽没原平均数大，但换成了好地，产量增加一·七石，中农每口平均地三·一三亩，产量六·八七石，当中每口平均地四·二六亩，产量九·三二石（因抽典地少产粮二斗），这证明并未伤害中农利益。
    如果遇到尾巴小窟窿大的贫瘠村，只能降低分配标准，也决不能损害中农利益。如三区，字岭村地主土地不多了，全村人口平均土地是一·七亩产量是四石，只好降到土地一·四亩产量三石多的标准来分配。分配时则是根据标准不足者补齐，超过者不分，总之这种办法是对填窟窿的平衡作法，并非全面推平的作法。
  二、分配时应照顾的几点
    根据这个标准，对烈军抗敌、赤贫窟窿尽先给填以外，还需照顾到许多细节。如对孤寡光棍的照顾的问题，在分配中常遇到老赤贫的老光棍，在分配时应照顾这点，如石城对光棍分配时，每口以一口半人分土地，以备结婚等，对人口较多而且少生产有办法之户，在产量平均少一斗半斗也就不再填补，在山货特产的照顾方面，原则是家家都有，但如果分了一契地，因特产收获较大，产量平均稍差者亦不填补，主要的还是好坏远近地的照顾，这个调剂是很重要的，如黑虎村贫农马富魁原有十八亩远坏地，在分配时就分给八亩好近地，一般对近地好地烈军属尽先调剂，这样在他们耕种与群众代耕均为便利。
  三、按产量分配的具体方法
    按产量分配主要是根据负担的地亩产量账，把全村的人口地土产量的平均数公布，此后群众的窟窿户或农会中选出评委会和原来的翻身委员会结合干部共同挨户按产量评议，把评议结果在农会公布，让群众通过，再进行分配，这样标准明显又使领导与群众相结合，分配非常公道合理，对果实分配也能形成群众性管理。
