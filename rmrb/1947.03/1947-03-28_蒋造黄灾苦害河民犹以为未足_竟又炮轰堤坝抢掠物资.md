[This dispatch from our newspaper's office in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 26th] After the raging Yellow River waters flowed into the territory of Shouzhang County, villages and towns along the river in the county, such as Sun Village and Hejiawa, were completely submerged. Three dikes at Zhang Village, Lujiazhuang, and other locations have already collapsed. On the 17th and 18th, Chiang Kai-shek's troops invading Nanluli (Dancheng) bombarded the residents of Sun Village and Hejiawa on the north bank who were salvaging property and repairing dikes, causing 65 casualties. Upon hearing the news, our democratic government rushed to the area and transported the injured residents to Zhangqiu People's Hospital for treatment.

[This dispatch from our newspaper's office in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 26th] Just as the residents of the old course of the Yellow River were suffering from the yellow river disaster, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Yuncheng plundered our dike repair materials everywhere and bombarded the north bank dikes for days, massacring disaster-stricken residents. On the 16th, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Yuncheng used trucks to steal all the iron hooks, firewood and charcoal stored by our Yuncheng River Defense Section. On the 17th, Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the south bank of Sunkou bombarded the Sunkou dike, firing seven incendiary bombs, igniting the grass dam, which was mostly destroyed, making the dike even more critical.

[This dispatch from our newspaper's office in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 25th] After all the Yellow River water poured into the old course, the river water rose sharply. Within four days, from the 15th to the 18th, in the territories of Puyang, Fanxian and Shouzhang counties, the river water generally rose by 20 meters. The linked ditches at Zhangjiyang, Caoziyu and other places between Fanxian and Shouzhang were all flooded by the Yellow River water, and the dangerous works along the river at Liqiao, Sunkou, and Shilipu are all in critical condition. The Fanxian-Shouzhang River Defense Section is currently leading the masses in rushing to block the river ditches and dikes day and night.

[Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu, 26th] Due to years of silt accumulation in the riverbed of the old course of the Yellow River, the incoming Yellow River water overflowed the river channel in the Dongzhuang area of Fanxian County on the night of the 17th. The dangerous works in this section at Lidui, Yangji, Hongmiao, Longkou, Wulongtan, etc., are all in critical condition, and the 200-li dike is also thin. Although the people there are urgently repairing it, they are constantly bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. On the 23rd, Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Yuncheng bombarded the Sunkou dangerous works from across the river.

[Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th] Millions of people in the Bohai Sea Region along the old course of the Yellow River will be displaced by the Yellow River disaster created by Chiang Kai-shek. The Administrative Office of the Bohai Sea Liberated Area has issued another emergency appeal, mobilizing the residents along the Yellow River to immediately defend themselves and save themselves according to the planned steps, and to take revenge on the Chiang bandit who caused the disaster. It also reiterates its request to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to immediately allocate funds for dam and dike projects and relocation fees in accordance with the agreement.
