　　Yuci Guerrilla Unit Launches Political Offensive, Over Forty Yan Puppet Troops Surrender
    [This dispatch from] Taihang, 7th of this month: The Yuci small-scale guerrilla unit is launching a political offensive near enemy strongholds along the railway. In the past month, over forty Yan [Xishan] puppet troops have abandoned their weapons and defected. When the masses in Kaizhan saw the guerrilla unit, they said, "If you hadn't come, we wouldn't be able to survive. Yan Xishan oppresses us so much that it's impossible to live. Every tael of silver costs three shi of wheat. If we don't pay, they will skin us alive and leave us out in the cold." The families of the puppet troops in Beizhao cried to the guerrilla unit, vying for "Glorious Soldier Certificates" and requesting to return to the Liberated Areas. Many landlords living in the city are destitute. For example, the parents of Xiao Wen from Zikeng both froze to death in the City God Temple. Our guerrilla unit has been conducting activities deep inside the city, and tens of thousands of leaflets are flying everywhere. The landlords know that the democratic government welcomes them back to their hometowns and guarantees their livelihoods. They are all returning home one after another. After the landlord Kui Shuancheng returned home, he was comforted and helped by the democratic government. He cried bitterly and vowed to stand with the peasants and oppose the unscrupulous merchants.

　　榆次武工队开展政攻阎伪军四十余人投诚
    【本报太行七日电】榆次小型武工队，迫近铁路附近敌据点展开政治攻势。一月来阎伪军摧机投诚的已达四十余人，开占时群众见到武工队时说：“你们不来我们就活不成了，阎锡山欺压我们实在难活，每两银要三石麦子，不给便剥皮挨凉。”北赵伪军家属对武工队大哭，争着索取“荣师证”要求回到解放区。许多地主住在城里，生活无着，如紫坑小文的父母双双冻死在城隍庙。我武工队深入城内活动，千万张传单满天飞，地主们知道民主政府欢迎他们回乡并保障他们的生活，都纷纷返家。地主奎拴成回家后，经民主政府加以安慰与帮助，痛哭流涕，誓死和农民在一起，反对暴商。
