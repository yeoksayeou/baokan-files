　　Yang Congying's Reunion with Her Son
    —A Story of the Emancipation of the People of Wu'an

    One afternoon after the Lantern Festival, Yang Congying, an emancipated poor woman from the vegetable garden street in the south gate of Wu'an city, received her son, Guo Fang, from the street office of the democratic government. She had sold him eight years ago due to hunger and cold. The son was already twelve years old.

    During the emancipation movement, Yang Congying was an activist in the vegetable garden street. She is thirty-four years old this year. The comparison between her experience of poverty and suffering in the past thirty-four years and the current situation makes her feel that the democratic government and the Communist Party are even closer than her own parents. Her mother starved to death when she was eight years old, and she was sold to the Guo family as a daughter-in-law by her hungry father when she was only fourteen years old. The miserable life that followed made her often resent her cruel father. But when she was again forced by hunger to sell her own son, Guo Fang, the inner pain was even indescribable. At this time, she no longer resented her father; but who should she blame? She could only secretly shed tears, resenting that she was "born and raised in poverty," and resenting that she and her son had a "bitter fate!"

    The day after she took her child back, I visited her house with a worker from the city. She was sitting on the edge of the kang, holding her child and crying. No, not crying, but happy. She told me that she was telling her child: "Fang, this is our home, our own home, and I am your mother, your biological mother." She was happy, but tears involuntarily flashed in her eyes. When Fang called out "Mother!" tears fell like two strings of beads on the child's face. Her sixteen-year-old daughter leaned beside her, bowing her head and stroking her younger brother's head. My visit evoked painful memories for her.

    Her first husband, surnamed Guo, was a poor opium addict. From the age of sixteen, she washed clothes, cooked, and served people in the landlord's house. Even in the cold winter months, she had to soak her frozen and bleeding hands in the icy river water outside the city every day to wash clothes. At the age of twenty-two, she was forced to be dismissed because people thought she had too many children (one daughter and two sons). In 1936, when the youngest child, Fang, was two years old, her husband wandered to the northeast (and died in the northeast not long after). She relied on sewing and washing clothes for others to raise her children. After the Japanese occupied Wu'an City, her life became even more difficult. The money she earned in a day could only buy some bean flour soup, which was "thinner than the landlord's noodle soup." She let the younger ones drink first, and she herself could only save a mouthful to drink. In the autumn, she was so hungry that "a man with arms as thick as this was carrying a dry skeleton."

    "Let the child escape with his life!" The neighbors all advised her like this. Oh my god! She was about to sell her child again! But hunger finally forced her to do so. On the first day of the second lunar month in 1938, she took Fang from her nipple and was taken away by someone amidst her cries. Fang's brother was adopted by another household in the Guo family, and she worked as a wet nurse for others to take care of her miserable mother and daughter.

    "Why sell my child and come to nurse other people's children?" She would cry whenever she thought of it, and therefore often incurred the owner's scolding.

    Yang Congying's current home is where she remarried after selling Guo Fang. Her husband is a water carrier. During the great famine of 1943, the family sold everything, even the broken mat was gone, so they had to flee for their lives separately. She took her daughter and wandered around the Shijiazhuang Railway Station for several years, and returned after the Eighth Route Army liberated Wu'an. Her husband did not return, and there is still no news of him. As soon as she came back, she and her elderly father-in-law and mother-in-law received relief from the democratic government. In the emancipation movement of the masses in the south gate, she was an activist among women. She recognized the old society, broke the view of a bitter fate, and awakened the earliest. Therefore, she stood at the forefront and waged a resolute struggle against the rulers of the old society. Now she has been emancipated, has a house and land. She and her mother-in-law and daughter are spinning cotton, and her daughter is also going to school to study. She is also doing "things for our people" in the Women's Federation.

    "Which one was not given to me by the Communist Party and the democratic government," she looked around the tables, cabinets, chairs, and stools in the house, and the blankets and bedding spread on the kang. "And my Fang! After being emancipated, having everything, I thought of Fang, and this is the only thing that made me sad. The democratic government also promised that I could redeem him, and now he has indeed been redeemed," she hugged the child even tighter.

　　杨从英母子团圆记
    —武安人民翻身故事
    元宵节后的一个下午，武安城南关菜园街翻身贫妇杨从英，从民主政府的街公所领回了八年前因饥寒交迫卖出了的儿子郭方的。儿子已经十二岁了。
    在翻身运动中，杨从英是菜园街的积极分子，她今年三十四岁。过去三十四年贫困痛苦生活的体验与今天情况的对比，使她感到民主政府，共产党比爹娘还亲。她八岁时娘就饿死了，还是十四岁的儿童就被饥饿的父亲卖给郭家作了媳妇；以后的悲惨生活使她常常怨恨狠心的父亲。但当她又被饥饿逼得要卖自己的儿子郭方的时，内心的悲痛更是没法说出。这时她不再怨父亲了；但是该怨谁呢？她只好暗暗流泪，怨自己是“穷里生、穷里长”，怨自己和儿子的“命”苦啊！
    她领回孩子的第二天下午，我和城关一位工作员上她家访问，她正搂着孩子坐在炕沿上哭呢。不，不是哭，是高兴。她告诉我，她正在告诉孩子：“方的，这是咱的家，咱自己的家，俺才是你的娘，是你的亲生娘”。是高兴，但是热泪不由得在她眼内闪动。当方的一叫“娘”！眼泪就像两串珠子，扑簌簌滚在孩子的脸上了。她的十六岁的闺女，倚在旁边，低着头在抚摸弟弟的头。我的访问引起了她的痛苦的回忆。
    她的第一个姓郭的丈夫是个吸料子的穷汉，从十六岁起她就在老财家里洗衣做饭侍候人。寒冬腊月，她也得天天把冻得流血的双手，浸在城外冰冻的河水里洗衣服。到二十二岁，人家嫌她孩子多（一女两男），被迫解雇。民国二十五年，最小一个孩子——方的两岁时候，丈夫流落到关外去了（不久死在关东），她靠为人缝补与洗衣抚养儿女。日本人占了武安城后，她的日子更艰难了。一天赚下的钱只能买点豆面滚汤，“比老财家的面汤还稀”。先让小的喝，她自己只好剩一口喝一口。到秋天饿得“胳膊粗的汉子顶着一个干骷髅”。
    “让孩子逃个活命吧”！邻家壁舍都这样劝她。天哪！临到自己又要卖孩了！但饥饿终于迫得她不得不这样作。民国二十七年二月初一，她把方的从奶头上摘下来，哭叫着被人家带走了。方的哥哥过继给郭家另一户，她给人家作奶妈来顾着她凄惨的母女俩。
    “为甚把俺孩卖，倒来奶人家的孩呢”？那时她一想起就哭，因此也常常惹主人的骂。
    杨从英现在的家，是在卖了郭方的后改嫁的，丈夫是一个担水卖的。民国三十二大灾荒，家里卖得连破席片也没有了，只好各自逃生。她带着女儿到石家庄车站上流浪了几年，八路军解放武安后回来了。丈夫却没有回来，到现在还没音信。她一回来就与年老的公公、婆婆获得民主政府的救济。在南关群众的翻身运动中，她是妇女中的积极分子，她认识了旧社会，打破了命苦的观点，觉悟得最早。因之站在最前面和旧社会的统治者作坚决的斗争。现在她翻了身，有了房又有了地。她和婆婆、女儿都纺花，女儿还上学念书，她还在妇救会“为咱老百姓办事情”。
    “那一样不是共产党、民主政府给俺的”，她环顾家里摆的桌柜椅凳和炕上铺的毛毯被子。“还有俺的方的！翻了身，有了，我就想方的，就是这件事我心里难过。民主政府又答应我可以赎回来，现在果然赎回来了”，她把孩子抱得更紧。
