    A Wonderful Prescription for Reneging on Debts
    Dongfang Man

    Since Marshall could not make the Chinese people stop arguing and obediently become slaves to the gold standard, and Molotov insisted on forcing him to report on "the implementation of the agreements reached" at the last Moscow conference, this Secretary of State and Marshal, after twenty-four hours of consideration, came up with a brilliant plan: "Reneging!"
    The first movement of "Reneging" is: "Push," pushing the problem from inside the meeting to outside the meeting. The reason Marshall painstakingly invented was: "The Three-Nation Declaration on China is not a Foreign Ministers' Meeting Declaration," so it can only be discussed outside the meeting.
    This is typical diplomatic rhetoric, translated into plain language, it means: "Although it is clear that the meeting was held by the three foreign ministers, and the declaration was issued by the three foreign ministers, it is really inconvenient to settle the account on the spot. Old brother, let's talk about it behind the scenes!"
    The second movement of "Reneging" is: "Make a fuss," with newspapers like Hearst ranting anti-Soviet and anti-Communist at home, and ordering the Chiang family's lackeys to "love the country and protect rights" in China.
    The US-Chiang clique naively thought that by colluding they could still use this guise to deceive a few more people. But a Shanghai vendor had already pierced through it with one sentence: "Indeed, business has been bad since American goods came!" This is truly genuine patriotism (not selling American goods!) and protecting rights (the right to survive!).
    The third movement of "Reneging" is: "Overturn." Not only can the debt of December 15th be denied, but even what was agreed to a few days ago for outside discussion can be completely overturned with a change of face.
    However, Mr. Marshall! The debts written down in ink at diplomatic conferences can be reneged on, but the blood debts written by American troops, warships, planes, and bombs on Chinese territory cannot be reneged on. Tell me, have Konoe and Tojo ever been able to renege on them?

    赖账奇方
    东方漫
    马歇尔既无法使中国人民不吵不闹，服服贴贴的做金元奴隶，而莫洛托夫偏偏非要逼着他对上次莫斯科会议“所达到的协议的执行情形”作报告不可。于是经过二十四小时的考虑，这位国务卿兼元帅，果然想出一个妙法来：“赖！”
    “赖”的第一部曲是：“推”，把问题从会里推到会外。马歇尔好不容易发明出的理由是：“三国对中国声明，并非外长会议声明”，因此只能会外讨论。
    这是典型的外交辞令，翻译成明白的话，就是：“虽然明明会是三国外长开的，声明是三国外长发的，但当场算账，实有不便，老哥，咱们还是拉个背场谈吧！”
    “赖”的第二部曲是：“闹”，在国内是赫斯特一类的报纸狂吠反苏反共，在中国是下令蒋家奴才“爱国护权”。
    美蒋满以为他们串通起来还能再利用这种幌子骗几个人。但一个上海小贩早已一句话戮穿：“的确自从美国货来了以后生意就没有了！”这话里才真是真情在爱国（不卖美国货！）护权（活得下去的生命权！）
    “赖”的第三部曲就是：“翻”。不仅十二月十五的账可以不认，就是几天以前答应的可以会外讨论也可以脸子一变，大部推翻。
    但是，马歇尔先生！外交会议上写下的墨笔账好赖，美军、美舰、美机、美弹在中国领土上写下的血账，却是赖不掉的。你说，近卫，东条可都曾赖掉过么？
