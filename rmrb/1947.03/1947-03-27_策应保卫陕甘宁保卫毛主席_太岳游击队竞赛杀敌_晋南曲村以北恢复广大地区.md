[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 25th] Since mid-March, all local armed forces in the Taiyue region have launched a campaign to eliminate the enemy in response to the call to defend Chairman Mao, annihilating more than 200 enemy soldiers in ten days. Guerrilla teams from Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingchuan, and Huoxian counties in the First Military Sub-district have penetrated the railway lines and areas around Fenxi to attack Yan Xishan's stubborn troops who are nibbling away at territory and looting grain, killing and capturing 43 enemy soldiers and seizing five rifles. The gun-seizure campaign by the Linfen-Jixian guerrilla team in the Second Military Sub-district continues to unfold, seizing two enemy machine guns and thirteen rifles, killing and capturing 31 enemy soldiers. The Anyi-Xiaxian Independent Battalion in the Third Military Sub-district organized small armed units to penetrate the suburbs of Anyi, and at one point attacked the Dafang Village stronghold, 40 miles northwest of the county. Wenxi has recovered the Liuyukou stronghold. These two locations have killed and captured 25 enemy soldiers including a major commanding officer, destroyed one vehicle, seized eight rifles, and one telephone. The Mengxian guerrilla team in northern Henan repelled two attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's troops invading Pozhang, killing and capturing 16 enemy soldiers, seizing 16 rifles, and more than 400 rounds of ammunition. The leaders of the Taiyue Military Region issued a commendation order on the 21st to commend the above guerrilla teams.

[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 25th] In early March, the military and civilians in southern Shanxi once again smashed the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan troops' mopping-up operations, and at the same time launched a major offensive. As of the 3rd of this month, the security regiments and militia fought 29 battles, twice attacking the town of Qucun, killing and capturing 26 enemy soldiers, destroying the roads between Quwo Shicun and Qucun Shicun, intercepting 15 enemy transport carts, more than 8,000 catties of wheat, one machine gun, nine rifles, more than 500 rounds of ammunition, 1,800 catties of electric wire, four mules and horses, and liberating more than 100 civilian laborers. Most of the areas north of Qucun and east of Mengcheng, which were previously nibbled away by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, have been recovered, and 16 armed village governments have been established. Sixty-seven Chiang's stubborn soldiers took the opportunity to flee or were won over by us. The offensive is still continuing. On the 15th of this month, the militia of the Fourth District ambushed the enemy on the Mengcheng highway, capturing seven enemy transport carts, more than 6,000 catties of wheat, one rifle, and capturing one enemy soldier. On the 12th, the Xiangling Security Brigade ambushed Chiang Kai-shek's troops looting grain in Nanliang, killing and capturing 14 enemy soldiers after an hour of fierce fighting, and seizing 12 rifles. On the same day, the Hongtong militia laid mines in the Heshenmiao area, killing two enemy soldiers, and sniping killed three.

[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 25th] The Jiyuan Second District militia, which persists in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and protects the masses' land reform, has fought more than 100 battles in the past five months, killing, wounding, and capturing 133 enemy soldiers, with only one of our soldiers wounded. The squad personally led by Comrade Wang Jie, the district instructor, has achieved even more remarkable results. Their small guerrilla team of 12 people fought day and night with the enemy, engaging in 73 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 105 enemy soldiers, with no casualties on our side, creating a brilliant record of 0 versus 105. Thanks to the active participation of the militia, all 25 administrative villages in the district have been restored, and the land reform of 10 administrative villages has been protected, and a joint defense system of 16 administrative villages north of Nanling has been established. In order to better protect the land reform, they proposed a kill-the-enemy competition to the Mengxian Independent Battalion: From March 15th to the end of this month, they guarantee to complete the task of killing and capturing 20 enemy soldiers and protecting the land reform in four villages.
