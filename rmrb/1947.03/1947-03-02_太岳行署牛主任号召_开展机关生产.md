(This report from our newspaper in Taiyue, dated the 28th) Director Niu of the Taiyue Administrative Office held a meeting on the 19th with cadres from various directly subordinate organs in the Taiyue region. Director Niu reported on the region's production and conservation issues for the year, calling on all cadres to engage in production and conservation to welcome a brighter future and to launch a campaign to earn merit. He provided clear and specific explanations of the various guidelines and plans for launching a major production campaign in the Taiyue region this year, requiring livestock from various government organs to assist the masses in plowing for three days without compensation during the spring plowing season. When discussing the issue of production in government organs, he pointed out the significance of such production this year, which lies in reducing the burden on the people, taking the lead in the major production campaign, and supporting the front lines to strive for greater victories. Therefore, under the principle of the rear supporting the front and the local areas supporting the troops, efforts should be made to gradually achieve complete self-sufficiency in everything except grain and clothing, with government organs solving their own difficulties and individuals solving their own problems. It was also stipulated that each person should contribute 2,000 yuan's worth of production value to the public annually. The guiding principle for production in government organs is to emphasize agriculture, sideline occupations, and handicrafts equally, and to earnestly correct the past tendency to focus solely on commercial activities. This year, all commercial activities related to production in government organs must be centralized and managed uniformly at each level, overcoming the incorrect practice of relying solely on a small number of production personnel without organizing all personnel in the government organs to engage in production. Production in government organs should be combined with the work and needs of the organs themselves, making use of specialized skills and doing what one is capable of, while being consistent and continuous, paying attention to both major and minor tasks. Self-spinning and weaving, planting in small vacant areas, and rolling cigarettes are encouraged. He suggested that each government organ should establish a production committee to implement management, supervision, production, and enjoyment by all, and that no idle person should be allowed in any government organ, and no waste of public money should be permitted. A two-hour production system should be established, and strict economy should be practiced, eliminating all unnecessary expenses and lowering living standards. However, in order to address the difficulties faced by local cadres in guerrilla areas and to strengthen the struggle against the enemy, it was decided that the treatment of local cadres in guerrilla areas should also be appropriately improved, with a distinction made between their treatment and that of cadres in rear areas.

　　太岳行署牛主任号召
    开展机关生产
    【本报太岳二十八日电】太岳区各直属机关干部于十九日集会，由行署牛主任报告今年全区生产节约等问题，号召全区干部生产节约，迎接光明，开展立功运动。对太岳区今年开展大生产运动的各项方针和计划作了明确具体解释，要各机关牲口在春耕中无代价的给群众代耕三天。谈到机关生产问题时，指出今年机关生产的重要意义，在于减轻人民负担，给大生产运动带头，支援前线争取更大胜利。因此，应在后方照顾前方、地方照顾部队的原则下，应逐渐做到除粮食被服外，其余全部自给，机关困难机关解决，个人困难个人解决。并规定每人全年交公二千元的生产任务。机关生产的方针，是以农业、副业、手工业并重，认真纠正过去只着重经营商业的偏向。今年所有机关生产，商业部分必须按级集中，统一经营，克服把机关生产单纯依靠少数生产人员而不组织机关全部人员来生产的不正确做法。机关生产应和本机关的业务和需要相结合，发扬一技之长，会什么干什么，要经常持续，看大又看小。提倡自纺自织，种空隙小地，卷纸烟等。他建议说：各机关要成立机关生产委员会，实行大家管理，大家监督、大家生产、大家享受，不许可机关有一个闲人，不许可浪费公家一元钱。建立二小时的生产制度，并厉行节约，取消一切不必要的开支，降低生活水平。但为了照顾游击区地方干部的困难，加强对敌斗争，决定游击区地方干部待遇也应适当提高，与后方机关干部待遇要有区别。
