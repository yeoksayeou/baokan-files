　　Director Wang of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee Speaks:
    Chiang Kai-shek's Aircraft Attack on Our Old Course Banks Is To Coordinate the Offensive in Southern Shandong
    UNRRA Should Immediately Stop Aiding Chiang Kai-shek's Regime in Blocking the Breach
    [Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 27th Dispatch] Wang Huayun, Director of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, spoke to reporters regarding Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft bombing of levee works along the old course and disrupting resident relocation, stating: "Chiang Kai-shek's forces violated the agreement in December last year by releasing water, causing a catastrophe for the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area along the river, leaving residents of the riverbed homeless. Under the protests of the people in the liberated areas and the opposition of national public opinion, Chiang Kai-shek's forces were forced to sign an agreement in Shanghai on February 8 to quickly provide relief to riverbed residents and allocate funds to repair the dikes. However, Chiang Kai-shek's forces not only failed to implement the agreement but also dispatched large numbers of aircraft to indiscriminately bomb and strafe our riverbank dangerous works, material factories, shipyards, ferries, houses, riverbed resident relief materials, and river management personnel. As of now, 67 of our ferries have been destroyed, worth a total of 130 million yuan. 760,000 catties of straw were burned, worth 70 million yuan, and a total of 94 employees and civilians were injured or killed in the attacks. A UNRRA vehicle transporting relief supplies for riverbed residents was destroyed, making it impossible for UNRRA to carry out its work and forcing it to withdraw completely. Chiang Kai-shek's repeated signing of agreements to deceive the people has once again been exposed by the bloody facts it has created."
    When reporters inquired about Chiang Kai-shek's intentions in attacking the riverbanks, Director Wang emphasized: "It is obviously a cruel military conspiracy. The attacks on our riverbanks have been going on for more than ten days, which shows that Chiang Kai-shek not only wants to destroy the dikes and prevent relief work, but his main intention is to blockade the Yellow River, cut off our transportation between the north and south banks, and clear the way for his offensive in southern Shandong. We pointed out long ago that Chiang Kai-shek's talk of river management is all a military and political conspiracy at heart, but UNRRA still does not believe it. This time, UNRRA representatives Mr. Hanson, Mr. Jiang Sheng, and others witnessed the tragic situation of Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft bombing and strafing along the river and the suffering of the residents. The iron facts have completely proved that UNRRA's past active assistance in blocking the breach was a trap set by Chiang Kai-shek. Now that Chiang Kai-shek's scheme has been fully exposed, UNRRA should immediately stop all assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's regime in blocking the breach."
    [Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 27th Dispatch] After Chiang Kai-shek's forces violated the agreement by releasing water, they also dispatched the air force to wantonly destroy the old course's dike restoration and relocation efforts. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office issued a circular to the entire country and the world denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities. It stated in brief:
    The Chiang government violated the agreement by releasing water, causing unprecedented catastrophe for the people downstream, and Chiang Kai-shek also sent the air force to bomb wantonly, destroying dikes, dangerous works, docks, and boats along the old course, and strafing villages along the river. We solemnly denounce this unprecedentedly brutal crime to the entire country and the world! The Chiang government says it is managing the river on the Yellow River issue, but it is actually carrying out its military and political conspiracy. After tearing up the Heze, Nanjing, and Shanghai agreements, it sent a large number of American-made aircraft to bomb wantonly along the old course. The large and small boats and dike-repairing straw that our people built in all kinds of difficulties were mostly burned down, and 25 river management workers were killed or injured, and 94 civilians were injured or killed in the attacks. A UNRRA vehicle was destroyed, and personnel were forced to withdraw. Therefore, our dikes cannot be repaired, dangers cannot be rescued, and riverbed residents cannot be saved. We especially make an urgent appeal to the entire country and the world on behalf of the people of the entire Hebei-Shandong-Henan region to immediately stop the US side from helping Chiang Kai-shek's side to unilaterally block the breach, recall the American staff at Huayuankou, and stop military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek.
    [Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, 27th Dispatch] American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft have repeatedly attacked urban and rural areas in counties such as Shouzhang, Zhangqiu, Yanggu, Fanxian, Liaocheng, and Shenxian in recent days. Villages on both sides of the Yellow River from Puyang to Shouzhang were harmed, and many civilian and merchant ships were destroyed. The people of all counties in Hebei-Shandong-Henan deeply hate the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft.

　　冀鲁豫黄委会王主任谈：
    蒋机袭击我故道沿岸是为了配合进攻鲁南
    联总应即停止援助蒋方堵口
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日电】冀鲁豫黄河水利委员会主任王化云，为蒋机轰炸故道沿岸堤工，破坏居民迁移工作，对记者发表谈话称：“蒋方去年十二月违约放水，使冀鲁豫沿河遭受浩劫，河床居民无家可归。在解放区人民抗议与全国舆论反对之下，蒋方又被迫于二月八日在上海签定一次从速救济河床居民和拨款抢修河堤之协定。然而蒋方不但不执行协议，并且连日派大批飞机，对我河堤险工、料厂、船厂、渡船、房屋、河床居民救济物资及治河员工滥施轰炸扫射。截至目前止，我方渡船已炸毁六十七只，值一亿三千万元之巨。秸料被烧七十六万斤，价值七千万元，员工群众被袭击伤亡者共达九十四人，联总运送河床居民救济物资汽车被炸毁一辆，致使联总无法进行工作而全部撤回。蒋贼屡次签定协议麻痹人民的假面具，又一次为其所制造的血腥事实揭穿。”
    记者询及蒋方袭击沿河用意何在，王主任着重称：“很明显的，是残忍的军事阴谋。袭击我沿河，已持续十余日之久，足见蒋贼不仅欲破坏河堤，阻止救济工作，其主要企图则为封锁黄河，切断我南北岸交通，扫清其进攻鲁南的后顾之忧。我们很久以前就指出，蒋方口头治河，其内心全是军事政治阴谋，但联总犹不相信。这次联总代表韩森、蒋生等先生目睹蒋机沿河轰炸扫射，居民受害的惨状铁的事实已完全证明过去联总积极帮助堵口，是中了蒋贼的奸计。今天蒋贼的奸计毕露，以后联总应立即停止对蒋方堵口的一切援助。”
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日电】蒋方违约放水后，又派遣空军大肆破坏故道复堤抢险及迁居移民工作，冀鲁豫行署特通电全国全世界控诉蒋方暴行。略称：
    蒋政府违约放水，下游人民惨遭空前浩劫，而蒋介石又派空军大肆轰炸，故道河堤、险工、渡口、船只均被破坏，沿河村庄悉遭扫射。对此史无前例的残暴罪行，我们沉痛向全国及全世界控诉！蒋政府对黄河问题口头上说是治河，而实为遂行其军事政治阴谋。撕毁荷泽、南京、上海协议后，又派大批美制飞机沿故道滥施轰炸，我人民于万般困苦中修造的大小船只、修堤秸料多被烧毁，治河员工死伤二十五人，被袭击伤亡群众达九十四人。联总汽车被炸毁，人员被迫撤去。因此，我方堤不能修，险不能抢，河床居民不能救，特代表冀鲁豫全区人民向全国全世界紧急呼吁，立刻停止美方帮助蒋方片面堵口，调回花园口美国工作人员，停止对蒋介石的军事援助。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】美造蒋机连日遍袭寿张、张秋、阳谷、范县、聊城、莘县等县城乡。濮阳至寿张黄河两岸村庄受害，民船商船多被炸毁。冀鲁豫各县人民对蒋机暴行，莫不切齿痛恨。
