Strengthen Education and Raise Awareness to Form a Surge of Enthusiasm for Joining the Army and Making Meritorious Contributions
Some Experiences in the Conscription Movement in Wu'an
[Report from our Wu'an correspondent] This time, the conscription movement in our county quickly formed a mass upsurge of enthusiasm for joining the army and making meritorious contributions. In three or four days, the entire county exceeded its quota, with more than 3,000 people voluntarily signing up. This movement has the following characteristics:

First, overcoming the cadres' simple task-completion mentality was emphasized. It was stressed that the conscription movement should be turned into an ideological movement, a mass movement. This meant not only mobilizing young people to join the army, but also mobilizing all the masses under the current new situation. Everyone should think about how to fulfill their responsibilities and start a meritorious service movement. For example: good young men go to the front line, while those at home give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and resistance fighters by plowing fields for them, supporting the front line, filling in gaps and making up deficiencies, and working hard in production. Different educational content and mobilization slogans were put forward for different targets. In this way, on the one hand, the masses' thinking was raised a step, and on the other hand, through conscription, the county's future meritorious service movement will be launched in all work. The county and districts have prepared merit ledgers so that this conscription truly becomes a mass movement. Seventeen cadres in the Fourth District acted under the slogan of "Leading the liberation in the past, taking the lead in joining the army today, adding merit upon merit." When it was announced that their merit would be transferred to the troops, other cadres also cheered.

Second, the content of propaganda and mobilization: One was the Fourth District's "Think about the past, compare with the present, look to the future," to consolidate the liberation for ten thousand years, we must fight Little Chiang and defeat Big Chiang. The other was the universal use of folk revolutionary stories to mobilize, such as using the story of the "Red-Haired Woman" opposing Xu Zhou, Lei Zhenhai's expedition to the north, Li Chuang Wang's attack on Beijing, to compare the fact that the people in the Great Rear today are all dissatisfied with Chiang's dictatorial rule and want to rise up in revolt. What is missing today is the north wind (Zhuge Liang lacked the east wind at the time), so we must join the army, defend ourselves, and save the people in the Great Rear. This is the spirit that all farmers in the world are one family. In the past, the old liberated areas liberated the new areas, which was a great achievement. Today, we must make another contribution. Furthermore, we must defend Chairman Mao and defend the land. The peasants said: Chairman Mao led us to turn over, like a bright light, illuminating the way for us. Joining the army to defend Chairman Mao is to repay the kindness of our liberation.

This time, the slogans were all put forward from a positive perspective. For example, for women, instead of opposing "dragging their feet," it was "Men joining the army have merit, and women at home are also glorious." For returning troops, it was "Old cadres, with ability, comrades at the front are waiting for you to lead them," "Revolutionary history is the most precious, return to the front and make meritorious contributions again," and so on.

Third, publicity methods: In addition to various meetings, this time each district issued conscription tabloids and newsletters to promptly disseminate and promote the masses in each district and village. They also created many publicity tricks to make the movement more enthusiastic. For example, the Tenth District used flags to write down the achievements of each village and traveled around the villages to spread the word. After completing its task, the Yehe area of the Third District went to other villages to parade. Dongmaxiang in the Second District completed twelve enlistments in one night and ran to the district in the middle of the night to report the news. While the Eighth District was holding a meeting, an old man had already led his son to the district for enlistment. These vivid stories were quickly spread in the villages, creating a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army and making meritorious contributions.

    加强教育提高自觉  形成参军立功热潮
    武安参军运动经验点滴
    【本报武安讯】这次本县的参军运动，很快即形成群众性的参军立功热潮，三四天中全县已超过任务，自动报名的达三千余人。这次运动有以下几个特点：
    一、首先提出克服干部单纯完成任务思想，强调把参军运动作成思想运动，群众运动，这就不是单动员年青人参军，而是把所有群众都在目前新形势下动员起来，要各人都想想自己如何去尽自己责任，掀起一个立功运动。如：好青年上前线，在家的优抗代耕，支援前线，填平补齐，努力生产。对各种不同对象，提不同教育内容与动员口号，这样一方面教育群众思想上提高一步，另一方面通过参军把全县今后的立功运动开展到一切工作中去。县区都准备了功劳簿，使这次参军真正形成一个群众性的运动。四区十七个干部，就是在“过去领导翻身，今天带头参军，功上加上功”口号下行动起来的，当宣布把他们这一功劳转到部队去时，其他干部也都狂欢起来。
    二、宣传动员内容：一是四区的“想过去、比现在、看将来”，要巩固翻身万万年，必须斗了小老蒋、打败大老蒋。一是普遍的都用民间流传的革命故事来动员，如以红毛老婆反徐州，雷振海征北，李闯王攻北京，刮北风来比喻大后方人民今天都不满蒋的独裁统治都要群起反抗，而今天所差的是北风（诸葛亮当时是缺东风），所以我们要参军，保卫自己，拯救大后方人民，这是天下农民是一家的精神。过去老区解放了新区，这是立一个大功，今天要再立功。再次是保卫毛主席，保卫土地。农民们说：毛主席领导我们翻了身，就像一盏明灯，给我们照着路。参军保卫毛主席，报咱翻身恩。
    这次口号都是从积极方面提的，如对妇女不是反对拉后腿，而是“男人参军有功名，妇女在家也光荣”，对归队是“老干家，有本领，前方同志等着你带领”，“革命历史最贵重，再回前方立功名”等。
    三、宣传方式：除各种会外，这次各区都出了参军小报与捷报等，及时传播推动各区村群众，也创造了不少的宣传花样，使运动更形热烈。如十区用旗写上各村成绩，走遍各村传播，三区野河完成任务后，到外村串通游行，二区东马项一夜完成十二名，当天半夜跑到区上报了信，八区正开会时，有老汉已带领儿子送到区上去入伍等。这些生动故事都很快在各村传说着，造成参军立功热潮。
