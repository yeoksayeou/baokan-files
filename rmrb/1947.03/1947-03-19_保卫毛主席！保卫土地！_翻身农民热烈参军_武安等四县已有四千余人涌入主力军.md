　　Defend Chairman Mao! Defend the Land!
    Peasants Who Have Overturned Their Lives Enthusiastically Join the Army
    Over 4,000 People from Wu'an and Four Other Counties Have Poured into the Main Force.
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The peasants who have overturned their lives in Wu'an have launched a campaign to join the army, "Defend Chairman Mao, defend the land!" In the two days from the 13th to the 15th, more than 2,000 young and strong men have joined the People's Liberation Army. In the old liberated areas of Yangyi and Berlin, 70 to 80 people joined the army from each village, while in the new liberated area of Yehe, 13 people joined the army in just two hours. The "Merit Citation" from the front line gave the peasants who had overturned their lives the greatest encouragement, and they went to the battlefield of patriotic self-defense with the heroic spirit of resolutely fighting in the land reform.
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Under the slogans of "Overturn your own lives and join the army yourself, protect your own interests yourself!" and "If you want to completely overturn your lives, dig up the roots of the landlords!" the peasants of Huguan County have set off a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, 1,380 young and strong men from the county poured into the main force. Xing Aiping, the secretary of the women's association in Dongguanbi, District One, and Li Xuehua, the chairman of the women's association in Pantuodi, not only actively mobilized their husbands and uncles to join the army, but also said to other women: "Today we are digging up the roots of the landlords! Our men are going to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and we women will not hold them back, but will work hard to produce!" Among the 108 soldiers who joined the army in District Two, several cadres took the lead in signing up. In District Three, 197 people volunteered to join the army in one day. Militia member Zhao Xianglou and his brother Xiangming competed to go to the front line. The brother said, "You are only 18 years old and not yet married, stay at home. I will join the army to protect our fruits of liberation." Xianglou said, "Since I'm not married, I don't have to worry about my family, I'd better go!" The two argued endlessly until the district finally sent his brother back. Guo Minfu, the political director of Panmachi in District Four, convened a family meeting. Minfu said, "Our family is doing well, this time I will take the lead in joining the army!" His younger brother immediately signed up. Guo Jiaoshui, deputy director of the Armed Forces Committee, said, "My father was killed by stubborn troops, this revenge must be avenged!" He immediately led a squad to join the army. The wife of Ji Junqi, the village deputy, compulsory education teacher, and director of the Armed Forces Committee of Dong Berlin Village in District Five, said to her husband when she mobilized him: "Overturning our lives depends on ourselves, and protecting the fruits also depends on us!" Her husband immediately signed up. The 60-year-old Li Changhai said, "Without strength, we can't dig up the roots of the landlords, I want to send my son to join the army!" Qin Ansheng, deputy director of the District Armed Forces Committee of District Six, took the lead in signing up to join the army at the village cadre meeting, and 50 village cadres also volunteered to kill the enemy and make meritorious service. The chairman of the Shenjiao Farmers' Association said, "I will not close my eyes in death until Chiang Kai-shek's attack is repelled!" The village chief of Futou Village said, "I used to be a cowherd, but now I am the village chief, who should go if I don't?" Lei Zhensheng, a large landlord from Dashannan, sneaked away to Beiping. This time, when the chairman of the Armed Forces Committee led 25 young people to join the army, they shouted in unison: "Overturn our lives to Beijing and catch Xie Zhensheng!" Comrade Ma Zhaocun is from Xiushan Village, Huguan. He made great contributions in the front-line battle, and the merit citation was sent back to his hometown. The whole village, men, women, and children, cheered and celebrated. Under this influence, more than 120 young people in the Xiushan community were determined to sign up to join the army, go to the front line to eliminate harm for the people, and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek troops. On the 7th of this month, the new soldiers of the entire Xiushan community and Ma Zhaocun's mother (sitting in a large cart), with a large sign more than a foot long in front of her, inscribed with the nine characters "Combat Hero Ma Zhaocun's Merit," were crowded by the masses before and after, with gongs and drums beating loudly, parading in Huguan Chengguan and other places. At this time, County Magistrate Wang squeezed out from the crowded audience and bought cigarettes for the new soldiers to smoke. The thousands of new soldiers from various villages who came to the city all praised Ma Zhaocun in unison and were determined to learn from him.

    [Our Newspaper] The upsurge of peasants in Heshun overturning their lives and joining the army has spread throughout the county. As of the 7th, more than hundreds of people in the seven districts have signed up, and 550 have been qualified after review. In the fourth district alone, 300 people signed up in one night, and in the third district, 111 people signed up in one day. In Shinanping, 56 people signed up in one night, including five women who asked to go to the front line. Guo Lianggong, a 65-year-old man from Malianqu Village in the third district, said to his son, "Gengfang, go and join the army! I have lived for so many years, and I have never had such a good life. If we don't go to protect the fruits, we won't have such a good life when Chiang Kai-shek comes!" Gengfang listened to his father and immediately signed up. Li Xiaoyu, the women's captain of Jiujing in District Two, persuaded her husband, "Good men should join the army! Go! I and our father will take care of the family, so you don't have to worry. Kill more enemies in the front and come back after defeating Chiang Kai-shek!" Before she finished speaking, her husband Zhang Cunyuan turned around and ran to the village office to sign up. Liu Luobao of Wenyuan Village in District Two mobilized his nephew and said, "Young people from other villages are all joining the army, you should go too! The Communist Party led us to turn over, who should we call if we don't go to protect the fruits!" After five young people from a certain village signed up, they were sent back to the village because they were too young. They said unhappily, "They think we are too young and not qualified, we will grow up quickly and join the army again!" (Xiao Qiming)
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Under the call to defend the land and defend Chairman Mao, 569 young people in Lucheng have joined the People's Liberation Army. In the 16 villages of the fourth and fifth districts, 409 young people volunteered to join the army in one day and night. When the peasants of Lucheng were examining their thoughts and turning over their lives, news came that the Chiang-Hu troops were attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region. The peasants were immediately filled with anger. In Nancun, District Four, 86 young people joined the army. Hao Facheng, director of the Licungou Farmers' Association, said, "Chairman Mao led me to turn over, and I have no other way to repay his kindness. My eldest son has already joined the army, and now I will send my youngest son to be a Eighth Route Army soldier, even though he is only 17 years old. If I wait for him to grow up for two more years, it will be too late to fight Chiang Kai-shek." After more than 40 young people in Wang Village, District Five, signed up, they all automatically swore, "We will never come back until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated!" Zhao Xiao'e, a woman from Shandi Village, volunteered to sign up and said, "My man and I will join the Eighth Route Army together." An old man from Yun Village who was a military dependent also wanted to join the army. The masses said he was too old. He said, "I'm old, but I can't carry a gun, but I can still feed the horses and cook." Zhang Lisheng, a military dependent from Chongbi Village, was mobilized by his mother and wife to join the army. Cao Xiu, an old man from Huangnian Village, said, "I am too old to join the army, let my son go." Li Yin, chairman of the women's association in Nanjie Village, said, "I am a woman and cannot join the army to defend Chairman Mao. I guarantee to mobilize my husband to join the army." All the cadres in District One guaranteed to mobilize 340 young people to join the army within two or three days. The chairmen of the women's associations in each village also proposed: "Guarantee that women will not hold back, and mobilize their husbands to join the army."
