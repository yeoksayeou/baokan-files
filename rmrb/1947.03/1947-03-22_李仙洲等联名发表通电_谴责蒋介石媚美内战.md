Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 20th: Li Xianzhou, Deputy Commander of the Second Appeasement Zone of the Xuzhou Appeasement Headquarters, and other high-ranking Kuomintang officers who laid down their arms in the Laiwu Campaign in Central Shandong, jointly signed and issued a circular telegram on the 17th, calling for peace and launching an anti-civil war movement. The full text of the circular telegram is as follows:

    To all parties, organizations, schools, newspapers, and compatriots across the country: After the victory against Japan, unfortunately, the civil war broke out. Millions of officers and soldiers who should have been demobilized are not used for production but are left to rot in the wilderness. Countless precious financial resources are not used for construction but are consumed by the flames of war, leading to economic bankruptcy and devastation of production. This not only lowers our international standing but will also plunge the nation into eternal doom. Whose fault is this? Mr. Chiang should serve the people in his spirit, sacrifice himself for the masses, and should not have the color of dictatorship, colluding with American imperialism to launch a civil war, harming the people and the country. Moreover, the talents of the whole country (code unclear), its planning and leadership should be based on cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and follow the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) line. Therefore, in the current environment, the government authorities should no longer be blindly confident in military force, violate the PCC resolutions, and should respect public opinion in everything and base everything on democracy. The country belongs to the 450 million compatriots; politics is the affair of the 450 million compatriots. Its propositions and disputes should be determined by the compatriots of the whole country. How can we allow military disasters to continue, driving compatriots into the abyss of blood!? The examples of Hitler and Mussolini should serve as a warning. In the recent Battle of Laibei, because its essence violated the will of the people, the morale of the army was war-weary and morale was low. Moreover, under the erroneous strategic guidance of Chief of Staff Chen of the Ministry of National Defense, the entire army was annihilated, which was inevitable. Having seen this, Xianzhou and others resolutely laid down their arms and withdrew from the civil war. Now, in order to promote the early realization of national peace and democracy, we specifically call for peace and launch an anti-civil war movement. Today's China can only be saved by peace and democracy and opposing civil war. Only when the government army stops attacking the People's Liberation Army can the disaster be reversed. Therefore, the 450 million compatriots all have the responsibility to strive for peace. We hope that everyone will rise up together to eliminate the scourge of war, so that we can cooperate sincerely and move towards democracy together. Then the country will be fortunate! The nation will be fortunate!

    Signed: Li Xianzhou, Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the Second Appeasement Zone of the Xuzhou Appeasement Headquarters; Han Jun, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 73rd Army; Li Chen, Major General and Deputy Commander of the 73rd Army; Yang Ming, Major General and Commander of the 15th Division of the 73rd Army; Xu Yaxiong, Major General and Deputy Commander of the 15th Division of the 73rd Army; Su Chongguang, Major General and Commander of the 193rd Division of the 73rd Army; Gan Chengcheng, Major General and Brigade Commander of the 175th Brigade of the 46th Division; Hai Jingqiang, Major General and Brigade Commander of the 188th Brigade of the 46th Division; Chen Jiong, Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander of the 175th Brigade of the 46th Division; You Jingxiang, Major General and Director of the Political Department of the 175th Brigade of the 46th Division; Tao Zhongjian, Major General and Chief of the Third Division of the Second Appeasement Zone; Tan Shuchu, Colonel and Regiment Commander of the 45th Regiment of the 15th Division of the 73rd Army; Xia Fuxian, Lieutenant Colonel and Regiment Commander of the 56th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 46th Division; Wei Zhaoxin, Colonel and Regiment Commander of the 564th Regiment of the 188th Brigade of the 46th Division; Zhou Bing, Colonel and Regiment Commander of the 5234th Regiment of the 175th Brigade of the 46th Division.

    谴责蒋介石媚美内战
    【新华社华东前线二十日电】在鲁中莱芜战役中放下武器之蒋军高级军官徐州绥靖公署第二绥靖区副司令官李仙洲等，于十七日签字联名发表通电，呼吁和平，发起反内战运动，通电全文如下：
    各党派、各机关团体、学校、各报社以及全国同胞均鉴：抗战胜利后，不幸内战爆发，目睹数百万应复员之官兵不用于生产而陈尸原野，无数量宝贵之财力不用于建设而乃消耗于战火，使经济破产，生产涂炭，不徒国际地位低落，更将陷民族于万劫不复之地。此谁之过也？蒋先生应本为国民服务之精神，舍身为众，不宜有专制独裁之色彩，勾结美国帝国主义发动内战，殃民而祸国，且全国人才（电码不明），其策划与领导应本国共合作，遵循政协路线精神，故以目前环境，政府当局不应再迷信武力，违反政协决议，一切应尊民意，一切以民主为依归。夫国家者，四万万五千万同胞之国家也；政治者，四万万五千万同胞治理之事也，其主张与争执均应取决于全国同胞，安可兵运祸结，驱同胞于血海深渊！？希特勒、墨索里尼之徒可为殷鉴。此次莱北之战，因其本质违反民意，致军心厌战，士气低落，且在国防部陈总长错误之战略指导下，全军覆没，势所必然。仙洲等有见及此，毅然放下武器，退出内战，今为促进国家和平民主早日实现，特呼吁和平，发起反内战运动。盖今日之中国，只有和平民主、反对内战方可救国，只有政府军停止进攻解放军，方可挽回劫运。故四万万五千万同胞均有和平奋斗之责任，望一致奋起以消除战祸，使精诚合作共向民主而迈进，则国家幸甚！民族幸甚！
