In the Wu Xun land reform great examination, many villages witnessed village cadres and activists responding to the call of the District Party Committee by voluntarily returning excess gains. In Xiji Village, First District, village cadres decided on their own reward method when distributing the gains, awarding themselves over 200,000 yuan. After education by the leadership, they came around, admitted their mistakes to the masses, and returned the excess gains. In Wangxin Village, Second District, village cadres used gains funds and privately borrowed cotton from landlords and rich peasants to establish a cooperative, which has also been handed over to the masses for operation. After inspection, 185 mu of land that had not been distributed in Qianwang Village were quickly distributed to the poor, and 80,000 yuan of gains funds were extracted and distributed to poor and middle peasants. Under the slogan of "All Poor People Are One Family," 25 mu of land were given to poor peasants in Houwang Village. In Dazhi Fangtou Village, Fifth District, village cadres privately used gains to establish a cooperative, and all gains were delayed in distribution. Now the cooperative has been transferred to the Farmers' Association, and all the gains, 73 mu of land and 500,000 yuan, have been distributed, eliminating extreme poverty in the entire village. Because village cadres and activists returned the distributed gains to the peasants, the morale of the peasants was greatly enhanced. After the clearing of gains in Dazhi Fangtou, a great reflection on land reform was immediately carried out, and everyone actively volunteered when carrying stretchers. In the Fourth District, besides Liu Yingwu, who did not separate from production, the remaining cadres bought the fruits of struggle cheaply. Two cadres even divided the gains funds of the masses, making it difficult to promote the work of mobilizing village cadres and activists to return excess gains. After reflection, cadres throughout the district decided to first rectify themselves before leading village cadres to return excess gains. The specific methods for rectification were: (1) Register the items bought by cadres, the method of purchase, when, and from which village. (2) The original items must be resolutely returned, and damaged items should be compensated at market prices. After evaluation, district cadres returned 26 pieces of clothing, 13 pieces of woodenware, and compensated 14,600 yuan for the increased value. With the problem resolved, the cadres also felt very happy. Village cadres in ×× Village collectively embezzled 90,000 yuan and, under the influence of the district cadres returning gains, handed it all out. Liu Peitian took out a good coffin, and 778 pieces of lost clothing, quilts, and leather suitcases were all found.

　　武训村干响应党的号召
    自动退出多得果实
    纸房头私用果实成立合作社亦交给群众
    【本报冀南二十七日电】武训翻身大检查中，许多村庄由于村干积极分子响应区党委号召，纷纷退回多得果实。一区溪集村干在分果实时自己决定提奖办法，共提奖二十余万元，经过领导上教育打通了思想，已向群众认错，退出了多得的果实。二区王信村村干私用果实款、私借地主富农棉花开办合作社，亦已交由群众经营。前王庄经过检查，未分的一百八十五亩地已迅速分给贫民，并抽出八万元果实款分给贫中农，在“天下穷人是一家”的号召下，送给后王庄贫农土地二十五亩。五区大纸房头村干私用果实成立合作社，所有果实迟迟不分，现在合作社已转入农会全部果实七十三亩地、五十万元，已分配下去，全村赤贫已消灭。因为村干、积极分子把分得果实退给农民，农民情绪大大提高，大纸房头清理果实后，紧接着进行了翻身大反省，出担架时人人踊跃。四区不脱离生产的干部除刘影武外，其余干部都贱买了斗争果实，还有两个干部分了群众的果实款，因此动员村干积极分子退出多得果实工作难以进行。全区干部经过反省，决定先清理自己，再领导村干退出了多得果实。清理的具体办法：（一）登记干部买的东西，买的方式，什么时候，何村的。（二）原物坚决退回，坏者应按市价赔偿。经过评议，区干退回了衣裳二十六件、木器十三件、增价赔偿一万四千六百元。问题解决了，干部也觉得很愉快。××村干集体贪污了九万元，在区干退出果实影响下，也全部拿出来。刘培田拿出好棺材一个，以前失掉的衣、被、皮箱七百七十八件又都找出来。
