(This article was transmitted by our correspondent from the Taiyue area on the 12th.) The land redistribution campaign has resurged in the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area. Since the large-scale invasion by the enemy last autumn, mass movements in Southern Shanxi were halted. After the Lunar New Year, due to the urgent demands of the masses and the attention and promotion of leadership, the movement has restarted. Xia County is the fastest and most successful in its mobilization. After the fifth day of the first lunar month, Xia County designated seven key villages to begin preparations. After the twentieth day of the first lunar month, the key villages began liquidation struggles. Villages like Xigou and Caojiazhuang have now concluded, and the fruits have been distributed. The masses in Xigou received an average of more than four mu of land per person. The masses are extremely enthusiastic and continue the liquidation during enemy "sweeps," with militia providing cover and the masses persisting in land distribution. Pinglu, Wenxi, and Anyi counties have also begun liquidation. Anyi persisted in land distribution struggles even under the enemy's "sweep" of two thousand troops.

　　晋南解放区在战争频繁中
    再度掀起分田斗争
    【本报太岳十二日电】晋南解放区再度掀起分田斗争。去秋敌人大举进犯以来，晋南群运即陷于停顿，旧历年后，由于群众的迫切要求及领导上的重视和推动，运动又重新展开。其中以夏县发动较快，较好。阴历正月初五以后，夏县即划分七大基点村酝酿起来，正月二十以后各基地开始了清算斗争，西沟、曹家庄等村现已结束，果实亦分配了。西沟群众每人平均得地四亩以上。群众情绪极高，在敌“扫荡”中继续清算，民兵掩护，群众坚持分田。平陆、闻喜、安邑等县也开始了清算，安邑在两千敌人“扫荡”下，仍坚持分田斗争。
