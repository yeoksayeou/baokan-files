　　Our Army’s He Defa Squad Returns Victoriously After Fighting Behind Enemy Lines
    [This newspaper, Frontline of Ji-Lu-Yu, 13th dispatch] The First Battalion, Fourth Company, First Squad of a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army, on the 18th, near Dingtao, when the main force was transferring, was ordered to find guides and lost contact with the company. They were stranded behind Chiang’s army. Under the leadership of Squad Leader He Defa, after eight days of arduous struggle, they finally returned victoriously to the team on the 25th. Near Dingtao, the squad encountered the Chiang side’s security regiment. In an emergency, some newly liberated soldiers showed wavering, and some new soldiers expressed fear. He Defa said to the whole squad: "I learned how to fight guerrilla warfare in the Eighth Route Army. As long as we maintain a good relationship with the masses, we are guaranteed to be fine, and guaranteed to bring you back to the team." Everything they borrowed from the common people along the way was returned to the original owner. They carried water and swept the floor for the common people. The grain and firewood used in the eight days were all obtained from the village chief, and were carefully registered for reporting to superiors for repayment after returning to the team. He Defa also particularly pointed out: To struggle independently, it is even more necessary to improve skills. Therefore, he also led the entire squad in combat exercises along the way. After returning to the team, the regimental meritorious service committee decided to award He Defa the title of Model Worker and suggested approving his admission to the Party. The First Battalion held a soldiers' meeting on the 26th to welcome them, and representatives from other battalions participated and sent many gifts of appreciation. Squad Leader He Defa was liberated from Chiang’s army during the Ping-Han Campaign the year before last. He said: When he first came to the Eighth Route Army, he went to a place in Lingchuan, Shanxi. The common people there were very miserable after being ravaged by Chiang’s 27th Army. The superiors told them to give some of their unwanted clothes and belongings to the common people. Only then did he believe that the Eighth Route Army was really for the poor. In March, when they arrived in Jiaozuo, the common people came to offer condolences and sent many gifts. Only then did he truly realize that the Eighth Route Army was the army of the people. He said, "This is why I brought this squad back."

　　我军某部何德法班辗转敌后胜利归来
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十三日电】八路军某部一营四连一班于十八日在定陶附近当大军转移时，奉命找寻向导，失掉连络，辗转蒋军后方，在班长何德法领导下，经八天艰苦奋斗，终于二十五日胜利归队。该班在定陶附近遭遇蒋方的保安团，情况紧急的时候，曾有个别的新解放战士表示动摇，个别的新战士表示恐惧，何德法对全班说：“我在八路军里学会了打游击，只要我们和群众的关系搞好，保险没事，保险带你们归队。”他们沿途所借用老百姓的东西都一律归还原主，给老百姓挑水扫地，八天里所用的粮食柴火都是找村长要的，且详细登记，归队后报告上级以便偿还。何德法又特别指出：要独立奋斗，更需要提高技术，因此沿途还带领全班进行作战演习。归队后团立功委员会决定授与何德法以模范工作者的称号，并建议批准其入党。一营特于二十六日召开军人大会欢迎他们，其他各营均派代表参加，并送慰劳品甚多。何德法班长是前年平汉战役中从蒋军解放过来的。他说：初来八路军时，到山西陵川某地，那里的老百姓经蒋军二十七军蹂躏后非常艰苦，上级叫他们把不要的衣服和东西送些给老百姓，这时他才相信八路军真是为了穷人。三月到焦作时，老百姓都来慰劳，送了好多慰劳品，他才真正认识了八路军是老百姓的军队。他说：“这就是我为什么把这一班带回来的原因。”
