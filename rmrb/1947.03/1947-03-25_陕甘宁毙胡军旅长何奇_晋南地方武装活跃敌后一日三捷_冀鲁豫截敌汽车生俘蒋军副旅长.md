    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd – He Qi, the brigade commander of the 48th Brigade of the Chiang-Hu army who ventured to invade the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has been killed. He is the first Chiang-Hu army lieutenant general-level officer to be needlessly sacrificed while executing the order of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to attack Yan'an.
    This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd – The Third Battalion of a local armed force in Southern Shanxi is active behind enemy lines, achieving three victories in one day, killing, wounding, and capturing 65 enemy soldiers, including a Kuomintang army company commander, and seizing 39 rifles and one machine gun. On the 5th, this unit cooperated with the Xia County guerrillas and militia to ambush the enemy at Yanzhang, killing and capturing four enemy soldiers and seizing two rifles. On the same morning, the unit encountered a Kuomintang army company in Guoli Village, resulting in a fierce battle that captured ten enemy soldiers, including a platoon leader, and seized four rifles. On the same evening, the unit launched a surprise attack on the enemy's "Love the Village" Tenth Company in Weiguo Town, completely eliminating the enemy in 20 minutes, killing and capturing 33 enemy soldiers, including the company commander Zhang Wenwu, and seizing one machine gun and 30 rifles and short guns. Zhang Wenwu was a notorious tyrant from Zhou Village, Xia County, who personally massacred more than 200 farmers. The people of Northern Xia County hated him to the bone. This time, our army completely eliminated the enemy without any casualties and killed Zhang Wenwu, which made the people of Xia County rejoice and bring pigs and sheep to show their appreciation to the army.
    This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Frontline, 23rd – On the 15th, the people's guerrillas of the Fourth Military Subdistrict of Hebei-Shandong-Henan ambushed Wangkan, north of Yanjin, intercepted a Chiang army vehicle, killing seven people, including Chen Yuanxiang, the political director of the Fifth Pacification Zone, and capturing 18 people, including Gao Qiangbin, the deputy brigade commander and political director of the 127th Brigade of the 41st Division.
