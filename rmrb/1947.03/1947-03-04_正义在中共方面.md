　　Justice is on the side of the Chinese Communist Party
　　Zhang Gangbo
　　The famous Shanghai democrat Mr. Zhang Gangbo recently published an article entitled "Reading Mr. Zheng Yun Junyun's Advocacy of Political Mental Health" in the combined issue of Volumes 14, Issues 4 and 5 (published on February 4th) of the Shanghai "Masses Magazine", denouncing the fallacy that "the greatest obstacle to peace lies in the suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party." In the article, he stated his position, saying: "I also declare that I am over sixty years old and have never been affiliated with any party... Since the victory, the military has been overbearing and the bureaucrats have been tyrannical. The people are living in dire straits, and the country is on the verge of collapse. I am risking my old life to stand up and join with the gentlemen to strive for democracy. Last year, I went to Beijing to petition for this reason." Then he put forward two points: (1) Marshall was by no means an arbitrator invited by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, nor was he a disinterested third party, but rather he came to implement the US policy of aggression against China, "regarding China as a colonial cesspool," supporting the Kuomintang with one hand and regarding the Communist Party as a thorn in his side, nominally an arbitrator but actually an accomplice. He was wholeheartedly instigating civil war, and his blaming the civil war on the suspicion between the two parties was to shirk responsibility at the Moscow Conference. (2) In the life-and-death struggle between democracy and anti-democracy, government by the people and dictatorship, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot be treated equally. It is necessary to distinguish right from wrong, otherwise it is helping the dictators. The following is an excerpt from the second half of the full text. The title is added by us. Mr. Zhang is a national capitalist, and this article tells us how deeply the general public today despises the rule of the four big families.
　　—Editor

　　...The Kuomintang, relying on foreign aid, launched a civil war. Using the weapons of others to kill their own compatriots. What's more, it is the unrighteous attacking the most righteous, the tyrant robbing the people. Starting a war for no reason, making enemies of the whole country, what could be more insane! What they are maintaining is the rule of one-man dictatorship and one-party autocracy. What they are preserving is the privileged class, scraping the people's fat and oil. They do not hesitate to lead wolves into the house, allowing foreign troops to garrison fortresses. They are betraying the country and selling it for glory, signing treaties that cede sovereignty. Their hearts are to be condemned, their crimes unforgivable. There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart, no greater humiliation than shamelessness. Their poison will harm the present and their stench will linger for a thousand years.
　　...The warmongers are going their own way, recklessly starting wars, trying to eliminate the CCP by force. They undermined the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and unilaterally convened the National Assembly. They forcibly control public opinion with violence, and special agents eliminate dissidents. The peace talks finally broke down, and the momentum has become a prairie fire. After that, all issues will be resolved on the battlefield. You advance step by step, aggressively pressing people into a desperate situation. How can people be willing to wait for death with their hands tied, and be slaughtered with their necks stretched out? Forced to resist, swords and soldiers meet, and the victorious will be the merciful. When the military situation is unfavorable, they will launch another round of peace offensives, trying to resume peace talks. If the situation were reversed, would you be fooled again? They are tyrannical, insidious and treacherous, abandoning faith and righteousness, hypocritical monks, greedy, cruel and fierce, and full of evil. Heaven's sins can still be forgiven, but self-inflicted sins cannot be lived with!
　　Speaking of suspicion, it is not mutual. Only the weak fear the strong, and are always prepared to suffer losses. That's why the CCP is suspicious of the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang only has hatred for the CCP. They regard them as irreconcilable enemies, hating them for fighting for power, especially as strong rivals. For twenty years, the CCP has suffered countless massacres and oppressions from the Kuomintang. Even the third party, the Democratic League, has suffered the same treatment. To this day, there are still tens of thousands of people imprisoned and abused. These are the most outstanding people, and also our young men. Last year's promise of amnesty this year only benefited the general corrupt officials, corrupt officials, thieves and adulterers, who are social scum who have reappeared in broad daylight. However, the political prisoners, the elite of the country, have sunk into the sea without a trace and are still trapped in the dark hell. Zhang Xueliang's remonstrance by force defended against foreign invasion and made contributions to the country. He stood up and waited for orders, which was understood by the world. Now, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he is still being held in custody, for more than ten years. Rewarding evil and punishing good, inverting merit and crime, ignoring promises and faith, it is truly destructive of reason. For the sake of the country's future, for the sake of cherishing talents, what kind of country is this absurd measure? Every time I think about it, my hair stands on end and my eyes are about to split. This group of warmongers, reactionary groups, are iron-hearted and unrepentant. Mr. Zheng advocates political hygiene to them, seeks democracy from dictators, seeks cessation of war from the god of war, talks about benevolence and righteousness to tigers and wolves, seeks compassion from Jie and Zhou, which is really like throwing stones into water, seeking skins from tigers, entering the pit of dung and maggots, and demanding cleanliness, entering the shop of abalone and seeking fragrance, isn't it running in the opposite direction?
　　Of course, the reactionary group, at the beginning of launching the civil war, thought they had full confidence in the military. In addition, the backstage boss patted his chest and boasted, relying on a hard backing. Airplanes, tanks, artillery, armor, military supplies, were continuously supplied. They were confident and fearless, and dared to risk the world's disapproval. They still thought that the CCP was like a turtle in a jar, with no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth, afraid of where she would escape? Therefore, Generals Chen Cheng, Du Yuming, Zheng Yunmin, Cai Wenzhi, and Liang Huasheng, flaunted their power and spoke shamelessly. They guaranteed to eliminate the main force of the CCP in three to five months, causing them to be defeated, surrender on their knees, and beg for mercy. One hand was wishful, and the other hand was calculating, steady and steady. But people have thousands of plans, and heaven only has one. They forgot the ancient訓, "Those who rely on virtue will prosper, and those who rely on force will perish." "Attacking the heart is the best, attacking the city is the worst." "Soldiers are like fire, if they are not restrained, they will burn themselves." "The people are like water, they can carry a boat, and they can also overturn it." Now the wars are endless, and it is difficult to get off the tiger. The horned sheep has entered the fence.
　　...Mr. Zheng's criticism of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as being equally bad, as being from the same hill, is flawless. Standing in the neutral position of a third party, it seems to be the fairest and most appropriate. In fact, this kind of non-committal, ambiguous position is very different from my observation; it is not in line with my principles. We must distinguish right from wrong, black from white. Confucius hated purple for taking away from red, hated weeds for messing up seedlings, and hated those who are similar but not the same, also for this reason. What is right is right, what is wrong is wrong. What is real is real, what is false is false. It is absolutely not allowed to be vague, muddled, or ambiguous. It is especially important to avoid reversing right and wrong and confusing black and white. To act on impulse and establish subjective arguments. As far as I know, the Kuomintang authorities do hold "controlling self-confidence". And the Communist Party has "political self-confidence." (Editor's note: The quotations are from Mr. Ke of the Millard's Review) For ten years, the Communist Party has been in the liberated areas, enduring hardships, working hard and diligently. All policies are focused on serving the people's welfare. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, "equal land ownership, equitable capital control," "land to the tiller," the Kuomintang abandoned like tattered shoes, the CCP is implementing. There is Zhao Chaogou's "One Month in Yan'an" and Stein's "Challenge of Red China", which describe it in detail, and I have read the original English version from beginning to end. Furthermore, I can attest to what I have heard and seen. The so-called New Democracy, rectification movement, labor heroes, three-thirds system, and solving the land problem are all obvious facts. No matter how skillfully they use malicious propaganda, they can only deceive for a while, and will eventually not be able to erase the truth. Real gold is not afraid of fire, and there will be a day when the truth comes out. We have true knowledge and insight, and we can see clearly who will win and who will lose, who will gain the people's hearts and who will lose them? Which side is truly for democracy? Which side is anti-democratic or pseudo-democratic? Which side has revolutionary power and which side is the object of revolution? In the past year, during the peace talks, between righteousness and profit, all aspects have been revealed. The CCP stands upright, never changes, and adheres to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. This is a charter jointly signed by all parties and factions, a sacred and solemn law. Who is obeying it and who is violating it shows the level of personality. The so-called social notables have actually changed their minds halfway and sold out their friends for glory. The Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party have broken their alliances and sought favor by participating in the National Assembly. It is not necessary to deeply blame the petty people for seeing profit and forgetting righteousness, and being enthusiastic about wealth and honor. What is most heartbreaking is that the leader of a great country does not care about his own credibility or the spirit of abiding by the law. The four promises he personally issued were broken and never fulfilled. The five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were torn to pieces before the ink was dry. If this trend continues, the superiors will follow suit, and shame will be swept away. The CCP, on the other hand, is consistent in words and deeds, and strives for perfection. The military reorganization plan maintains a five-to-one ratio and abandons military confrontation. Moreover, it recognizes the National Assembly representatives appointed ten years ago, and its intention to compromise and seek peace can be made clear to the world, and it has also won the sympathy of righteous people.
　　I have always been optimistic about the situation and have firm confidence. China has a cultural and historical background of more than two thousand years, and it will not only not sink, but it will also be developed and promoted. Our natural talent is not inferior to any other nation. With education, it is not difficult to keep pace. Looking at the progress of the world, the success of the Soviet Union. The democratic tide is advancing rapidly, surging and unstoppable. Since the Republic of China, for thirty-five years, the people's intelligence has been enlightened and the atmosphere has been greatly opened. It has already transcended capitalism from its own feudalism and gradually transformed into socialism. In the transitional period of getting rid of the old and setting up the new, there will inevitably be a difficult course. The current chaotic situation and dark phenomena are the remnants of feudal poison and autocratic remnants, and they are the dying glimmers of a doomed decline. Reactionary autocracy is outdated and will be overthrown like decaying wood. Justice and democracy, in line with the trend, are like the rising sun in the east, and will surely rise. Before dawn, it is nothing but midnight. Before spring arrives, there is first severe winter. Metabolism and human evolution are endless.
　　As for Mr. Zheng's "advocacy of political mental health," I believe that the two sides cannot be compared. Because in fact, they are very different. On the one hand, the heart is pure and there is no mental illness, so there is no need to "treat mental illness with psychological medicine." On the other hand, it is the opposite. It is already riddled with holes and the disease has penetrated into the bone marrow. The critical and dangerous situation is probably ten or a hundred times worse than what Qin Shu of Jiangling said in his humble house. I am afraid that it cannot be saved by medicine, and it is not effective to cut and treat it. How can we still talk about light-hearted psychological medicine that can be reversed? If we still conceal our illness and avoid treatment, and delay and make mistakes, we will suffer our own consequences. We must wait for all the doctors to give up, respectfully express their apologies, be grieved by loved ones and pleased by enemies, and become a victim of the transitional era. We will see that the sins are deep, and we will not perish on our own. The disaster will spread to the party and the country, and we will die in our beds.

　　正义在中共方面
    张纲伯
    上海著名民主人士张纲伯先生近在上海《群众杂志》十四卷四、五期合刊（二月四日出版）上发表《读郑君允钧鼓吹政治的心理卫生读后》一文，痛斥“和平最大障碍，由于国共两党之猜疑”的谬论，文中自述立场说：“我也同时声明，年逾花甲，向无党派。……胜利以还，军人跋扈，官僚肆虐。民不聊生，国将不国，不惜老命，挺身而出，追随诸君子争取民主，去年进京请愿，亦本此意。”随即提出两点：（一）马歇尔决非国共双方同意邀请的调人，决非利害无关的第三者，而是来执行美国侵华政策，“视中国为殖民地的尾闾”，一手扶植国民党，视共产党为眼中钉，名为调人，实为帮凶。一心一意，挑拨内战，他之将内战归咎于两党的猜疑，是为了在莫斯科会议上卸责。（二）在民主与反民主、群治与独裁的生死斗争中，不能将国共双方同等看待，要明辨事非，否则就是帮独裁者的忙。下面选载的，是全文的后半部。题是我们加的，张先生是一位民族资本家，这篇文章告诉我们今日一般人士对四大家族的统治，已是如何深恶痛绝。
    ——编者
    ……国民党凭借外援，发动内战。用他人的武器，杀自己的同胞。何况是不仁伐至仁，独夫贼万民。兴无名之师，掳通国之敌，丧心病狂，孰过于此！所维持的，一人独裁，一党专政的统治。所保全的，特权阶级，刮地皮而来的民脂民膏。不惜引狼入室，许外兵驻要塞。媚外卖国，订丧权的商约。其心可诛，其罪不容赦。哀莫大于心死，辱莫甚于无耻，流毒当世，遗臭千古。
    ……好战分子，一意孤行，妄动干戈，想用武力消灭中共。破坏政协决议，片面召开国大。暴力强制舆论，特务排除异己。和谈终告决裂，大势已成燎原。此后一切问题，在战场上解决。你得步进步，咄咄逼人，置人家于绝地。人家岂肯束手待毙，引颈就戮？迫不得已，起而相抗，刀兵相遇，兵哀者胜。及至军事失利，又来一套和平攻势，要想恢复和谈。易地面处，你会再上当么？暴戾恣睢，阴贼险狠，灭弃信义，诈伪和尚，贪残酷烈，恶贯满盈。天作孽，犹可为，自作孽，不可活！
    讲到猜疑心理，并非是双方面的。只有弱者畏惧强者，时时刻刻备吃亏。所以中共对国民党，才起猜疑。国民党对中共，只有仇恨。视同不共戴天，恨其争夺政权，尤为劲敌。二十年来，中共受国民党屠杀压迫，不可胜计。即第三者的民盟，也受到同样待遇。至今被囚禁，受虐待，尚有数万人。此皆最优秀分子，也是我们的青年子弟。去年诺言，今年大赦，只便宜了一般贪官污吏，窃盗奸伪，枉法肮行的社会渣滓，重现于光天化日之下。而国家菁英的政治犯，反而石沉大海，仍陷于黑暗地狱之中。张学良兵谏御侮，有功国家。挺身待命，天下共谅。今抗战胜利仍受幽禁，时愈十载。赏恶罚善，功罪倒置，不顾轻诺寡信，真是灭没理性。为国家前途计，为爱护人才计，这种荒谬绝伦的措施，还成什么国家？每一念及，怒发冲冠，目眦灵裂。这批好战分子，反动集团，铁石心肠，怙恶不悛，郑君向他们鼓吹政治的卫生心理，向独裁求民主，求战神息干戈，向虎狼谈仁义，求桀纣发慈悲，真是以水投石，与虎谋皮，登粪蛆之坑，而言清洁，入鲍鱼之肆，而求馥郁，岂非南辕而北其辙么？
    当然啦，反动集团，在发动内战之初，自以为军事有十分把握。加之后台老板拍胸张胆，靠膀铁硬。飞机坦克，大炮兵甲，军火物资，源源接济。有所恃而无恐，甘冒天下之不韪。犹以为中共，已如瓮中捉鳖，上天无路，入地无门，怕她逃到那里去？故而陈诚、杜聿明、郑允民、蔡文治、梁华盛诸将军，耀武扬威，大言不惭。保证三五个月内消灭中共主力，使他溃不成军，屈膝投降，匍匐乞命。一只手如意，一只手算盘，笃笃定定。可是人有千算，天只一算。他们忘记了古训，“恃德者昌，恃力者亡”。“攻心为上，攻城为下”。“兵犹火也，不戢将自焚”。“民犹水也，既能载舟，亦能覆舟”。现在兵连祸结，骑虎难下，欲罢不能，带角羊已进笆河了。
    ……郑君对国共两方，作半斤八两的批评，以为一邱之貉，无所轩轾。站在第三者中立的地位，看来似乎再公平确当没有了。其实这种不落边际依违两可，与我的观察，大有出入；与我的原则，不相符合。我们要分是非，辨黑白。孔子恶紫之夺朱，恶莠之乱苗，恶似是而非者，亦职此故。是则是，非则非。实则实，虚则虚。决不容含糊囫囵，模梭笼统。尤切忌是非颠倒，黑白混淆。意气用事，主观立论。据我所知，国民党当局，确抱“控制性的自信”。而共产党则有“政治性的自信”。（编者按：引号中为密勒氏评论报凯氏的言论）十年以来，共产党在解放区，卧薪尝胆，埋头苦干实干。一切施政，专心致志，为人民谋福利。中山先生三民主义，“平均地权，筠制资本”，“耕者有其田”，国民党弃如敝屣，中共倒在实行。有赵超构著《延安一月》，斯坦因的《红色中国的挑战》，叙述备详，英文原本，我都从头至尾读过。再证之于耳之所闻，目之所见。所谓新民主主义，整风运动，劳动英雄，三三制，解决土地问题，皆是有目共睹的事实。凭他用巧妙手段，恶意宣传，只能蒙蔽于一时，终久不能将真相抹煞的。真金不怕火，必有水落石出的一日。我们真知灼见，洞若观火，孰胜孰败，谁得民心，谁失民心？那一方真正为民主？那一方是反民主或假民主？那一方有革命力量，那一方是革命对象？一年以来，和谈之际，义利之间，各方面原形毕露。中共顶天立地，始终不变，坚守政协决议。这是各党各派共同签署的宪章，神圣庄严的约法。谁在遵守，谁在违背，便见人格的高低。所谓社会贤达，竟有中途变节，卖友求荣。青年民社，背盟邀宠，参加国大。小人见利忘义，热中富贵，不足深责。最可痛心疾首者，堂堂一国领袖，竟不顾一己信用，守法精神。亲手所颁的四项诺言，食言而肥，从不兑现。政协五项决议，墨渖未干，撕成片片。此风一长，上行下效，廉耻荡焉扫地。中共则言行相符，委曲求全。整军方案，保持五与一的比例，放弃武力对峙。且承认十年前所指派的国大代表，其意图妥协，企求和平的苦心，盖可大白于天下，也得正义人士的同情。
    我对时局是向抱乐观的，更具坚决自信心。中国有二千余年文化历史的背景，不但不会陆沉，而且必有发扬光大的一日。我们天赋才智，不在任何民族之下。加以教育，不难并驾齐驱。外观世界的进步，苏联的成功。民主潮流，突飞猛晋，奔腾澎湃，莫可遏止。民国以来，攘三十五年，民智启发，风声大开。已由本身的封建主义，超越资本主义，逐步蜕化到社会主义。除旧布新，去窳改良，在过渡时期中，必有艰苦的历程。目前种种混乱局面，黑暗现象，便是封建余毒，专制遗孽，势将没落的回光返照。反动独裁，时代落伍，将如摧枯拉朽，必被打倒。正义民主，顺应潮流，已如旭日东升，必定抬头。黎明之前，莫非子夜。春天未到，先有严冬。新陈代谢，人类进化是无止境的。
    至于郑君“鼓吹政治的心理卫生”，我以为双方不能相提并论。因为事实上，大相迳庭。一方面心地本属纯洁，心里并无病态，用不着“心病还须心药医”。其他一方面，适得其反。已百孔千疮，病入膏盲。其危急险恶情形，殆十百倍于敝家江陵秦疏之所云。恐非药石所救，诚非割诊不为功。还谈得到轻描淡写的心药医，所能挽回么？若仍讳疾忌医，因循坐误，自贻伊戚。必待群医束手，谨谢不讳，为亲者所痛仇者所快，成了过渡时代的牺牲品。行见罪孽深重，不自殒灭，祸延党国，寿终正寝也。
