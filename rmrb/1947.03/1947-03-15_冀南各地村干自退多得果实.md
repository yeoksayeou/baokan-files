(This article transmitted by our newspaper from Southern Hebei on the 12th) In order to thoroughly level the playing field and make up for deficiencies, village cadres in various parts of Southern Hebei are consciously returning excess gains. Hu Dian, the leader of the Liuer Ying Joint Defense Zone in Chengci, admitted his mistake at the village mass democratic meeting, saying: "The land I was allocated was more than anyone else, fifteen mu for two people, which prevented other people from thoroughly improving their situation. I want to return five mu of land and two hundred jin of cotton to make up for the poor households." The chairman of the farmers' association said, "The land I was allocated was also more than the masses, I will return three mu." At the district-wide village cadre meeting in Qinghe Second District, District Chief Ma took the lead in announcing the return of twelve wooden strips he had bought cheaply in Baying. Under his influence, village cadres and activists from twenty-three villages also voluntarily returned gains from cheap purchases. Village cadres in Dong Wangdong Township, Ningnan, received excessive gains. After reflection, they admitted their mistakes to the masses. Instructor Tian Chongshan has already returned the land and items that should not have been allocated to the farmers' association. The chairman of the farmers' association also returned a house that was over-allocated, as well as some other items. Gao Sixiao, a representative of the emancipated peasants in Hulinzhai, Wanlu, embezzled two coffins and several bags of wheat during the mass movement last year. After mobilization and education, he has returned all the embezzled gains to the masses.

　　冀南各地村干自退多得果实
    【本报冀南十二日电】为彻底填平补齐，冀南各地村干自觉退还多得果实。成磁柳儿营联防区中队长胡殿，在该村群众民主大会上，自觉认错说：“我分的地比谁也多，两口人分了十五亩，使别的群众翻不透身，我要退出五亩地、二百斤棉花，填平穷户”。农会主任说：“我分得地也比群众多，我退回三亩。”清河二区全区村干大会上，马区长带头宣布退回在坝营贱买的十二根木条，在他的影响下廿三个村的村干积极分子也自动退出贱买果实。宁南东汪东镇村干多分果实，经过反省向群众认了错，指导员田崇山已把不应分的地和东西交还农会。农会主任也退回多分的宅子一处，其他物品一部。万鹿胡林寨去年群运中翻身代表高四小贪污了两口棺材和几袋麦子，经过动员教育，已将贪污果实全部退给群众。
