    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 24th - The land reform movement in southern Sui is being carried out in conjunction with armed resistance against Fu Zuoyi's massacres and suppression. Farmers in the border areas of Qingshuihe and Lin counties are actively exposing hidden special agents and conducting liquidation struggles. In two villages, for example, militiamen guarded the mountain tops several miles away against Fu's cavalry, while inside the villages, the masses held grievance and liquidation meetings during the day and moved outside the villages at night to discuss the distribution of the fruits of their labor. Their slogan was "Everyone comes to move (grain, property), the young men come to work." In one village, after liquidating the former puppet village chief Zhang Kai and others, nearly a thousand mu of land was recovered and distributed to seventy-five landless peasant households and families of soldiers and martyrs. In a village in Liangcheng, after the masses exposed the rumors and threats of landlords Sun Lushu and two other families, more than 600 mu of land were liquidated and distributed to forty-seven poor peasant households. A middle peasant household that lacked land also received land, and now the village has an average of 20.5 mu of land per person.

    绥南边沿武装分田
    【新华社晋绥二十四日电】绥南土地改革运动与武装反抗傅作义屠杀镇压结合开展，清水河和林两县边沿区农民，纷纷检举暗藏特务分子，进行清算斗争。某某两村，以民兵在山头警戒数里外之傅军骑兵，村内群众白天开诉苦清算大会，夜晚则转移到村外评议分配果实，他们的口号是“大伙来了转，小伙来了干”。某村向伪村长张凯等进行清算结果，收回近千亩土地，分配给七十五户无地之农民及军属烈属。凉城某村群众揭破地主孙禄寿等三家之造谣威胁后，清算出土地六百余亩，分配给四十七户贫苦农民。某户缺地中农也分得土地，现该村每人平均有地二十亩半。
