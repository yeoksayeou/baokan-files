    Cadres Reflect on Themselves, Masses Praise Achievements
    Qin County's Experience in Loving the People and Supporting Cadres
    When the mass movement in Qin County developed from widespread mobilization to in-depth investigation and sweeping away feudal remnants, many old revolutionary base areas and guerrilla zones experienced cadres becoming detached from the masses, causing dissatisfaction. In a few places, cadres were even struggled against by the masses in the same way as landlords, causing "pain to loved ones and joy to the enemy," and greatly hindering the work. Based on the spirit of uniting cadres and the masses, we sought ways to "love the people and support the cadres."
    The implementation of this slogan began in the form of rectification. At the time, villages were conducting land reform reviews, and many problems were directly or indirectly related to certain cadres. Therefore, these cadres who were detached from the masses were gathered together, separate from the masses, to carry out this work. This allowed the masses to boldly voice their opinions, and prevented cadres with problems from engaging in activities that opposed the masses out of fear of being struggled against. For example, Ni Village did not do this during the review, and cadres and the masses formed two opposing camps. After reviewing the work for more than ten days, not a single problem was identified.
    The main purpose of removing these cadres who were detached from the masses was to have them consciously reflect on and examine their shortcomings in their work, thereby achieving transformation. First, attention must be paid to dispelling ideological concerns: they feared being singled out for rectification, so some cadres without problems were also transferred in; they feared that admitting to corruption and struggling over the fruits of victory would lead to struggle by the masses, or that shielding landlords would lead to punishment by higher authorities, and were unwilling to speak; or they were unwilling to take responsibility because certain wrongdoings were related to individual district cadres. In such cases, district cadres should first conduct self-examinations to break down these concerns and help and guide them to carry out examinations. At the same time, explanation and education should be carried out among the masses, proposing the slogan of "supporting cadres." The masses' understanding of them was a great encouragement to them; their reflection would also be welcomed by the masses. For example, after the village cadres of the Sixth District reflected on themselves and returned to deal with the problems, they came back to report; after the village cadres of the Fourth District reflected on themselves and dealt with the problems, the masses reported on their behalf. These greatly motivated cadres who were reflecting or had not yet reflected.
    Although "loving the people and supporting cadres" proceeded separately, the initial focus was on "loving the people," on establishing the mass viewpoint, and only later on "supporting cadres." "Supporting cadres" is impossible without cadres' determination to change their work style and sincerity to confess and repent to the masses. However, when cadres confess to the masses, it will also not work without the masses' understanding and the principle of "face-to-face." In one village, after a cadre reflected on himself, he tearfully recounted his mistakes to the masses and returned the struggle gains he had obtained and embezzled. However, the masses did not show any willingness to be kind to him, even demanding as much as he returned, and wanting more after he had returned everything, leaving the cadre with no way out, resulting in new opposition. After Guo Rusheng, the political director of Heshanggou, reflected on himself and apologized to the masses, the masses saw that he spoke sincerely and refused to let him return the fruits of victory. He repeatedly tried to return them, but the masses repeatedly refused, pushing back and forth, only returning a portion. These cadres, receiving the love of the masses, were even more determined to serve the people. Therefore, once cadres have reflected on themselves, a movement focused on "supporting cadres" must be carried out immediately. Du Jinhe of Hougou became detached from the masses, and the masses were very dissatisfied with him. However, during the War of Resistance, when many people wanted to maintain relations with the enemy, he was the only one who dug many small cellars in his home and persisted in the struggle. The masses had not forgotten these heroic deeds, and as soon as he admitted his mistakes, he was immediately elected chairman of the Farmers' Association again. Song Village used a form of "praising achievements" to achieve good results. They had the masses list the merits of each cadre from beginning to end, absolutely not burying any of their achievements (even very small ones), in order to "support cadres" and encourage cadres to continue to perform meritorious service for the people. After recalling Guo Rusheng's meritorious deeds, Heshanggou greatly encouraged his courage to continue creating achievements, and he automatically led civilians to participate in the war.

    干部反省群众表功
    沁县爱民拥干经验
    当沁县群众运动发展到由普遍发动转向深入检查扫清封建尾巴的时期，许多过去的老区和游击区，都曾发生干部脱离群众，引起群众的不满，甚至少数地方干部被群众像斗争地主一样的斗争了他们，弄得“亲痛仇快”，工作受到了很大的阻碍。本着使干部与群众走上团结的道路精神，找出“爱民拥干”的办法来。
    在实践这个口号的时候，是用整风的形式开始的。当时各村正在进行翻身检查，有许多问题直接间接的和某些干部有关。因此，把一些脱离群众的干部调集在一起和群众分开来进行这个工作，这样，群众可以大胆的提出意见；有问题的干部也不致因为害怕群众斗争而进行某些与群众形成对立的活动。如倪村在检查当中没有这样做，干部与群众即形成对立的两个营垒，检查了十几天工作，连一个问题也没有检查出来。
    调出这些脱离群众的干部，主要是要他们自觉的反省与检查自己在工作中的毛病，从而得到改造。首先要注意到解除思想上的顾虑：他们怕专门整他们，调的时候，也调一些没有问题的干部来；他们怕反省出贪污斗争果实群众要斗争，怕包庇地主上级要处罚而不肯说；或是因某些错误行为与个别区干部有关，而不甘心自己担过。诸如此类，那么就由区干部自己先作检查，打破他们这些顾虑，帮助和诱导他们来进行检查。与此同时，在群众中进行解释教育，提出“拥干”的口号，群众谅解他们了，对他们是很大的鼓励；他们反省了，群众也会对他们表示欢迎。如六区村干部反省后回去，处理罢问题回来报告；四区村干部反省后，处理罢问题由群众替他们回来报告，都曾给正在反省或未反省的干部以很大的推动。
    “爱民拥干”虽是分头并进的，但开始重点是放在“爱民”，放在树立群众观点上，以后才放在“拥干”。没有干部改造作风的决心和向群众坦白悔过的诚意，“拥干”是不可能的。可是在干部向群众悔过的时候，如果没有群众的谅解，没有“面对面走”的原则，也闹不成。有一个村子，干部反省后向群众痛哭流涕的申述他的错误了，把他多得和贪污的斗争果实向群众退出了，群众却没有与他为善的表示，甚至你退多少要多少，退完了还想要，使这干部无路可走，结果形成新的对立。和尚沟政治主任郭如生反省后向群众道歉，群众见他说得诚恳，也就拒绝他退果实，他再三要退，群众再三不要，推来让去只退了一部分。这些干部得着群众的爱护，便会更加坚定了为人民服务的决心。所以干部既经反省之后，以“拥干”为主的运动，便须立即进行。后沟杜金和脱离群众，群众很不满意他。但他在抗战时，很多人要维持敌人了，只他一人家里挖了许多小地洞，坚持斗争，这些英雄业迹，群众没有忘掉，他一认错，马上又选他当农会主席。松村曾用一种“表功”的形式，获得良好的效果，他们让群众把每一个干部自始至终的功绩都表一表，绝对不埋没他们（即使是很微小的）每一功勋，以此来“拥干”，来鼓励干部继续为民立功。和尚沟追述了郭如生的功勋之后，大大鼓起他继续创作功绩的勇气。自动带民夫去参战。
