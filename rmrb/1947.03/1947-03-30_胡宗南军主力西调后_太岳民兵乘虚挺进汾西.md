    After the Main Force of Hu Zongnan's Army Was Transferred Westward
    Taiyue Militia Took Advantage of the Situation to Advance into Fenxi
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 28th dispatch] After the 90th Division and the 1st Division of Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan's army were transferred westward to attack our democratic holy land of Yan'an, the independent battalions, militia, and guerrillas of Xinjiang, Jilu, and other counties actively advanced towards southern Fen. The guerrillas who fought back to Xinjiang on the 3rd formed dozens of small armed groups and were active in the southern part of the county. On the 4th, a company of Chiang's army invaded Yangwang. The militia and guerrillas rose up to counterattack, annihilating a platoon of the enemy, killing and capturing 87 enemy soldiers, and seizing 12 rifles and 1 machine gun. After the victory news spread, the local masses took out hidden weapons and captured enemy and puppet personnel. The enemy in Xiangbi was forced to flee that night, and all Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army's local pawns and secret agents fled with them. Now, all three districts of the county have been re-liberated, and small armed groups are distributed throughout the county. The guerrillas and militia who fought back to Jilu have won three battles in five days since the 12th, killing and capturing more than 30 enemy soldiers. They are now sweeping away the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime and restoring the democratic regime.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 28th dispatch] The Taiyue 19th Military Sub-district held a gathering of heroes in its驻地 on the 27th of last month, and responded to the call to defend Chairman Mao. Summarizing the combat experience of the area, a total of 200 heroes and models from the military corps, guerrillas, and militia of the entire sub-district attended. Deputy Political Commissar Yang summarized the achievements of the Jinnan military and civilians in the half-year self-defense operation, saying: The troops fought 310 times, and the enemy's casualties were 12 times ours. The militia fought 931 times, killing and capturing 1,118 enemy soldiers, with 146 of our casualties, an enemy-to-us casualty ratio of 10 to 1, eliminating about one brigade of the enemy. He also pointed out that this was all the result of the heroes' loyalty and constant efforts for the people. From the 2nd to the 12th, the conference turned to group discussions and typical reports. Among the typical reports, Hou Tongyun, a model of a troop leader and model of a soldier, Liu Jihui, a model commander, Qiao Dongshun, a reconnaissance hero, and Shang Qingfu, Shen Qingxi, Shen Qingyuan, and Duan Wenzhong, militia heroes, were the most outstanding. Hou Tongyun cared for the soldiers in every possible way. During his year as squad leader, there were no desertions in the squad, and he completed every combat mission. In half a year, Liu Jihui transformed a newly established company into a company capable of completing assault missions with considerable combat effectiveness and improved the equipment of the troops. Qiao Dongshun twice conducted reconnaissance against the enemy, resolutely and bravely. In the Wangmao battle, he captured three enemy bandits alive, including Zhang Duanchang, in front of the enemy's bunker. Shang Qingfu had a variety of methods for laying mines and could combine them with sniping. Shen Qingxi, who combined wisdom and courage, led the militia to defend his hometown, penetrated deep into the enemy's heartland, and captured 49 enemy soldiers. Shen Qingyuan started with a sickle and once led a militia to seize the guns of an enemy platoon. Duan Wenzhong, at the advanced age of 40 or 50, served as the militia captain, and in six months the militia grew to 300 people, organized joint defense, and repelled several enemy attacks.
