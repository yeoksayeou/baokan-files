    Foreign Ministers' Representatives Meeting Achieves Results, Elections in Soviet Republics Concluded

    From now until the opening day of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Moscow Conference, there are only two weeks left. The London Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference, preparing for this meeting, is now actively accelerating its work. The draft Austrian peace treaty, except for economic clauses, has been fully completed. Important progress has also been made in the drafting report of the Allied Control Council for Germany. These two preparatory tasks are expected to be completed by the 25th.

    At this time, the elections to the Supreme Soviets of the sixteen Union Republics, which demonstrated the political and spiritual unity of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, were fully concluded on the 16th. Following this, the joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened on the 20th. One of the main tasks of the meeting is to decide on the Soviet Union's national budget for this year. According to the budget reported by the Soviet Minister of Finance, in the second year of this post-war new five-year plan, the funds for national economic construction in the Soviet Union have increased by nearly 27 billion rubles compared to last year, while defense expenditures have been significantly reduced (accounting for only 12 percent of the total), demonstrating the nature of a socialist country dedicated to peaceful construction. At the same time, the Soviet Union is continuing to demobilize large numbers of troops. The Soviet forces stationed in Germany have now been reduced to 200,000, and those in Austria to 30,000. Large numbers of demobilized soldiers will be投入投入 on the production front. The continued demobilization of troops and the increase in economic construction budget will undoubtedly greatly help the early completion of this year's production plan.

    In the United States, we see a different situation. Although measures by the reactionaries to restrict labor rights, maintain a huge military budget, and implement universal military training, and extend the conscription law have met with strong resistance from public opinion inside and outside Congress, especially from labor organizations, they are still being brewed and proposed. Regarding the attitude towards the upcoming Moscow Conference, the American reactionaries are, as usual, harping on the "anti-Soviet" tune. Of particular note is Vandenberg's speech last week, in which he hoped that Marshall "could become the representative of the united bipartisan foreign policy of the United States at the Moscow Conference, as successful as Benes." In this atmosphere, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, disregarding his position as a high-ranking government official, openly and unscrupulously discredited the Soviet Union, slandering the Soviet Union's peace policy as "aggression," and was protected by Marshall, which naturally aroused the protest of the Soviet government. In the reply on the 20th, the Soviet Foreign Minister stated that he insisted on his original opinion and considered Marshall's reply to be "unconvincing."

    The British coal shortage situation on the eve of the Moscow Conference has not improved much. In order to increase the number of miners, the British government is recruiting troops from General Anders' Polish exiled army and political refugees from other countries across the country. This move has been criticized by leftists. The British government announced on the 21st that it would reduce the army by a quarter. It is generally believed that the way to overcome the crisis lies in changing the current foreign policy. British Communist Party Secretary Pollitt, in his speech at the British Communist Party Congress, advocated "reorganizing the government" and "improving relations with the Soviet Union, new democratic countries, and colonies." General Secretary Wilner of the National Union of Mineworkers also believes that miners' lives should be improved to increase coal production and avoid disaster.

    Recently, the British government has suggested to the Soviet Union that it send personnel to the Soviet Union to continue trade negotiations. It is rumored that the UK and the Soviet Union are initially exchanging views on the issue of revising the alliance treaty. These situations will have an impact on the Moscow Conference.

    Although there are many difficulties in the upcoming Moscow Conference, as long as the major powers act in good faith, it is not difficult to obtain peaceful and harmonious resolutions.

    外长代表会议获有成就苏联各共和国选举结束
    从现在起到四强外长莫斯科会议开幕之日，只有半月时光了。准备这次会议的伦敦外长助理会，现在正积极加速其工作。对奥和约草案除经济条款外，已全部完成。盟国对德管制委员会之草拟报告工作，亦获重要进展。此两项准备工作预期于二十五日完成。
    在这个时候，表现了苏联各民族政治与精神一致的十六个加盟共和国最高苏维埃的选举，于十六日完全结束。继之苏联最高苏维埃的两院会议，于二十日开幕。会议主要任务之一，为决定苏联本年度国家预算，根据苏财长所报告的预算，在这战后新五年计划的第二个年头，苏联国民经济建设经费，比去年增加了几达二百七十亿卢布之多，而国防经费则予大量缩减，（只占总数百分之十二），这表现了社会主义国家和平建设的本色。与此同时，苏联还正继续进行大批军队复员工作，现在驻德苏军已缩减至二十万，奥境亦减至三万。大批复员军人，将投入生产战线。军队的继续复员与经济建设预算的增加，无疑将大大帮助今年生产计划的提早完成。
    在美国，我们看到另一种情况，反动派限制劳工权利，维持庞大军事预算及实行普遍军训，延长征兵法等法案虽遭到国会内外舆论尤其是劳工组织的坚强反抗，仍在酝酿提出。在对未来莫斯科会议的态度上，美国反动派照例又弹起“反苏”滥调，特别值得注意者为范登堡上周演说中，希望马歇尔在莫斯科会议中“能成为美国两党联合外交政策的代表人，像贝纳斯一样成功”。在这种气氛中，美副国务聊亚泽逊，竟不顾其政府高级官员职位，公开无忌惮地诋毁苏联，诬蔑苏联的和平政策为“侵略主义”，并且受到马歇尔的袒护，这自然要引起苏联政府的抗议。在二十日的复文中，苏联外长表示坚持其原来的意见，对马歇尔的复文认为是“难以令人信服”的。
    莫斯科会议前夕的英国煤荒情况，尚无若何改善，为了增加矿工，英国政府正在各地召募波兰流亡将军安德斯的部队及其他国家的政治亡命者。此举为左翼人士所指摘，英政府于二十一日宣布将减裁军队四分之一。一般认为克服危机的办法，在于改变现行的外交政策，英共书部波立特于英共大会演说中，主张“改组政府”，“并改善对苏与对各新民主国家以及对殖民地的关系”。全国矿联总书记威尔纳亦认为应改善矿工生活，以增加煤产来避免厄运。
    最近英政府已向苏联建议，派员赴苏继续贸易谈判。据传英苏间对修改同盟条约问题，正初步交换意见中。这些情况，对莫斯科会议不无影响。
    即将到来的莫斯科会议虽然困难不少，但只要各大强国本善意行事，则不难获得有利于和平的和协决议。
