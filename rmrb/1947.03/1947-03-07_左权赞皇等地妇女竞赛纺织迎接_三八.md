　　Women in Zuoquan, Zanhuang and Other Places Compete in Weaving to Welcome "March 8th"
    [Our Newspaper] As the "March 8th" Women's Day is approaching, women in Zuoquan, Shexian, Zanhuang, Pingding and other counties are actively preparing for the commemoration, launching weaving competitions, and preparing for weaving exhibitions, to further promote the weaving movement. In the third and fifth districts of Zuoquan, preparatory committees were established in late February to accelerate the preparation work. Zhao Chunhua, the top weaving hero of Taihang, proposed to the preparatory committee that in the half month leading up to "March 8th," each woman who can spin cotton should complete one jin of yarn, and each woman who can weave should complete seven jin of cloth. Women who cannot spin or weave should strive to learn to spin and be able to draw thread by "March 8th." The third district of the county decided to hold a conference at Tongtan, Songshuping, and Shili Dian, where three joint defenses are held, and collect good thread and cloth for exhibition and select models. Wang Jinzhuang in Shexian decided that on "March 8th," every woman in the village will wear new clothes and eat a good meal. Currently, every woman in the village is launching a movement to spin three jin of cotton, and a skill competition will be held at that time. In Zhao Bao Village, Zanhuang, all seventeen weaving groups in the village are actively weaving, striving to weave forty jin of cloth per person from the first month to the end of the month, with the whole village weaving 6,560 jin of cloth, taking practical achievements to commemorate their own festival. The cooperative has withdrawn 4.5 million yuan to help women purchase raw materials. Pingding, based on the different conditions in each district, proposed that villages with a foundation in weaving should achieve prosperity through weaving, secondary districts should achieve self-sufficiency in weaving, and villages that have not yet started should achieve semi-self-sufficiency. Women along the district should strive to learn to weave, and displaced refugees should achieve self-reliance through weaving, laying the foundation for long-term struggle. The entire county is striving to complete spinning 14,736 jin of cotton and weaving 62,394 zhang of cloth. To welcome the "March 8th" festival, a weaving competition movement has been launched throughout the county.
