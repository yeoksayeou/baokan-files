　　The Printing Plant of This Newspaper Achieves Success in Both Production and Thrift

    [This Newspaper] Since the production and thrift campaign began on March 1st, all employees of the newspaper printing plant have shown a high degree of initiative, and work efficiency has generally improved. The typesetting department, with fourteen participants, previously produced only three large newspaper pages. After the campaign began, in addition to setting three newspaper pages daily, they also set two pages of books. Comrade Song Fugen, a model worker from the previous youth work campaign, is even more active this time. He not only does his own work well but also actively helps others with page imposition. Comrade Tian Zhongyuan of the stereotype department proposed many ways to save money. In the past, they used sixty catties of large coal per month (at thirty-two yuan per catty). Now, they use coal dust and coal cakes instead, saving eight hundred and forty yuan per day. In the past, white paper was used to make paper matrices; now, waste paper is used entirely. In the past, they used to light a lamp while brushing paste; now, they can do it without a lamp, saving thousands of yuan per month. When this newspaper was founded, the engraving department had four skilled workers and four trainees, barely able to maintain the daily engraving work. Now, only the old technician Comrade Song Tingwen, with four trainees, can complete this work. In addition, they also conduct some amateur production, engraving seals for outside, producing more than fifteen thousand yuan in half a month. In addition to their work, comrades in the proofreading department actively sprout soybeans, etc. When one of the cooks in the kitchen was sick, Comrade Li Chengcai still ensured that everyone had good meals and also fed pigs and made tofu, etc.

　　本报印刷厂生产节约均获成绩
    【本报讯】本报印刷厂自三月一日开始进行生产节约立功运动以来，全体职工表现了高度的积极性，工作效率普遍提高。排字部参加生产的十四人，过去只做三块大报版，运动开始后，每日除排三块报外，还排两版书。宋福根同志是上次青工运动中的模范，这次更积极，他不但把自己工作做好，还积极帮助别人拚版等。浇版部田忠元同志提出许多节约的办法，过去用大块煤每月六十斤（每斤三十二元），现用煤面和煤糕代替，每日可省八百四十元。过去打纸版用白纸，现在完全改用废纸；过去刷浆糊点着灯，现在不点灯也行，这样每月省洋千元。刻字部在本报创刊时有四个熟练工人，四个练习生，刚能维持每日的刻字，现只有老的技师宋廷文同志一人带着四名练习生，就能完成这些工作。此外，还进行一些业余生产，给外边刻图章，半月多生产一万五千余元。校对科同志除工作外，积极纺织生豆芽等。伙房炊事员病了一人，李成才同志仍然保证大家吃好饭，另外还喂猪做豆腐等。
