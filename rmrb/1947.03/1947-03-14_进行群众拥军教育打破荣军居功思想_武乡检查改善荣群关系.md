　　Taihang, 12th (reported by this newspaper) Wuxiang's veteran-civilian and cadre-masses relations have greatly improved after the turn-over and inspection. In the past, in many villages, veterans were not well taken care of, and veterans sometimes made excessive demands due to their meritorious service, resulting in disharmony. During this campaign, the leadership paid attention to solving this problem. On the one hand, it carried out in-depth education on supporting the army among the masses in conjunction with the turn-over movement. On the other hand, it set up a training class for veteran activists in the district, led by the district head and branch secretary. The approach taken by the Second District was that the district head and branch secretary first expressed the attitude of "feel free to express any opinions," and everyone actively spoke. Many opinions were raised, and the leadership proposed from a positive perspective: "How to strengthen relations, what attitude should we take?" They inspired everyone to conduct self-criticism. After deliberation, it was unanimously believed that: "The reason why we were not united with cadres and the masses in the past was mainly us. The idea of ​​meritorious service was at play, which allowed special agents to exploit and sabotage, and we also became alienated from the masses, which was really dangerous." The leadership also represented all cadres and the masses in conducting a self-criticism, saying: "In the past, we did not do a good job in helping everyone establish a family, and we did not take good care of everyone when distributing the fruits of victory in several movements." Finally, He Yuangui, Shi Jufu, and other 13 model veterans who built their families through their own labor, implemented government decrees, obeyed village leadership, and actively helped the masses to turn over were selected. After returning to the village after training, joint meetings of veterans and village cadres were held to conduct self-criticism, and the estrangement was eliminated. During the Lunar New Year, veterans throughout the county actively participated in the movement. In Shuxin Village, two veterans were elected as cadres. During the distribution of the fruits of victory, veterans in each village participated in the evaluation committee, and the masses took special care of them and helped them establish their families. For example, the 13 veterans in Shuxin received enough fruits of victory, totaling 65 mu of land, 3 courtyard houses, 53 shi of grain, 38 pieces of clothing, and cattle, donkeys, sheep, furniture, farm implements, and silver dollars. Veterans and cadres and the masses said to each other: "We are truly one family." Now they are united in production.

　　进行群众拥军教育打破荣军居功思想
    武乡检查改善荣群关系
    【本报太行十二日电】武乡经过翻身检查，荣退军人与干部群众关系大大改善。过去运动中不少村庄对荣军照顾不够，荣军也因居功思想而有时过高要求，因此发生不融洽现象。这次运动中领导上即注意解决这一问题，一面在群众中结合翻身普遍进行深入的拥军教育；一面即以区开办了荣军积极分子训练班，区长、分书均亲自领导。二区的作法是由区长、分书首先表明“有啥意见大胆提”的态度后，大家便踊跃发言。意见提了许多，领导上即从积极方面提出：“如何密切关系，咱自己应抱啥态度？”启发大家作自我检讨，经酝酿一致认为：“过去和干部群众闹不团结，主要是咱，居功思想在作怪，结果让特务钻空破坏，咱们也脱离了群众，真是危险。”领导上亦代表全体干部群众检讨说：“过去没很好帮助大家建立家务，几次运动中分果实没很好照顾。”最后选出自己劳动建家、执行政府法令、服从村领导、积极帮助群众翻身的模范荣退军人何元贵、石具福等十三人。训练后返村，均召开，荣退军人村干部联席会，作了检讨，隔阂遂告消除。旧历正月填补中全县荣军均积极卷入了运动。树辛村并有两个荣军被选为干部。分果实中，各村荣军均参加评委会，群众特别照顾了他们，帮助他们建立了家务。如树辛十三位荣退军人，都分得足够的果实，计地六十五亩，楼房院三所，粮五十三石，衣服三十八件，牛、驴、羊及家具、农具大洋等，荣军和干部群众相见皆说：“真是一家人”，现正团结闹生产。
