    Democratic League Advocates Joint Mediation by the Three Powers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] According to United Press reports from Shanghai on the 17th and 18th: The Democratic League held a press conference on the 17th and issued a statement on the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain mediating the China problem, stating: The China Democratic League advocates that the participating countries of the 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference should "jointly mediate" rather than "jointly interfere" in the China problem. Luo Longji, a spokesperson for the Democratic League, supplemented the League's declaration, saying: "The Chinese people not only welcome this kind of friendly mediation, because mediating China's internal disputes is different from interfering in its internal affairs, the government (referring to the Chiang government) did not reject Molotov's suggestion in Moscow that it is necessary to review the China situation." In its statement, the Democratic League condemned the Kuomintang's atrocities of large-scale arrests in Peiping, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places, demanded the protection of human rights, and expressed that the League will continue to work tirelessly for the realization of democracy in China.

　　对苏英美检讨中国问题
    民主同盟主张三国共同调解
    【新华社延安十八日电】据合众社上海十七、十八日讯：民盟于十七日举行记者招待会，对苏、美、英调解中国问题发表声明称：中国民主同盟主张一九四五年莫斯科外长会议的参与国来“共同调解”，而不是“共同干涉”中国问题。民盟发言人罗隆基补充该盟宣言称：“中国人民不仅对此种友谊调解，因为调解中国内争与干涉其内政是两件不同的事情，政府（指蒋政府）没有拒绝莫洛托夫在莫斯科建议检讨中国情势之必要”。民盟声明中谴责国民党连续在北平、青岛、上海等地大批捕人的暴行，要求保障人权，并表示该盟不屈不挠继续为中国民主的实现而努力。
