    Model Soldier Jia Zitian
    Jia Zitian is from Fudong County. From a young age, he worked as a hired laborer. He served as the director of the district trade union, leading the emancipation movement of one hundred and twenty workers and farmers from twelve villages. Since the start of the self-defense war, he often thought, "If Old Chiang comes, poor people will definitely not survive." Therefore, he joined the army without any hesitation, bringing with him three young men: Bai Xuegui, Liu Chunshan, and Yang Heyun, and he didn't take anything from the village. At that time, his father was very ill at home, his younger brother had broken his leg, and he himself was still setting up a cotton gin. These difficulties couldn't stop his revolutionary enthusiasm. He said, "The revolution is a big thing, my own affairs are small. Only by protecting the liberated areas can we have a home."
    Since joining the team, he has been able to consolidate the comrades he brought with him, and he also explained and encouraged them in a timely manner, so they don't miss home and their work is active. In the squad's duties, such as carrying water, sweeping the floor, going on errands, serving food, getting meals, and getting up early, he always takes the lead, influencing his squad to rush to do everything. He used the money he earned from ginning cotton to buy pencils and paper, giving each person in his squad a pencil and a notebook, helping everyone study. One of his squad members, Wang Zhenduo, was sick, and he used his own money to buy noodles and cooked them himself for Wang Zhenduo to eat. Guo Quanshan was very backward. After joining his squad, through his constant persuasion and convincing, he slowly became an activist and did very well in both his studies and work.
    The landlord was backward and wasn't satisfied with asking people. Through his constant feeding the landlord's cattle, giving them water, weeding, and doing odd jobs, his relationship with the landlord gradually improved.

    参军模范贾子田
    贾子田是阜东县人，他自幼就给人家当雇工，曾任区工会主任，领导一百二十名工人和十二个村农民的翻身运动。自从打起了自卫战争后，他常想“老蒋来了穷人一定活不成”，于是便毫无顾虑的带着白雪贵、刘春山、杨合云三名青年参军，并且不要村中一点东西。那时他的家里父亲病的非常重，弟弟摔坏了腿，自己还安着轧车轧棉花，这些困难都阻止不住他的革命热情，他说：“革命事大，自己事小。保住解放区，才能有家”。
    自从到队后，他能把带来的同志巩固住，还及时的对他们解释鼓励，所以都不想家，工作又积极。在班的勤务上，如担水、扫地、出差、打菜、打饭、早起等都干到前头，影响的他班什么事都抢着去干。他用自己轧棉花赚来的钱买铅笔、纸，给他班每人一枝铅笔，一个本子，帮助大家学习。他班有个王振铎病了，他用自己的钱买挂面，并且自己做了给王振铎吃。郭全善很落后，到他班后，经他不断的劝解、说服，慢慢的成了一个积极分子，学习上工作上都很好。
    房东落后，问人都不满意，经他不断给老乡喂牛、饮牛、锄草、干零活，和房东关系慢慢就好了。
