	Vigorously Develop the Land Reform Movement in Newly Recovered Areas
	The Whole Situation in Zhuxian County is Opened Up; 100,000 Farmers Fight Against Traitors and Carry out Liquidations
	[Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 14th] After the liberation of Zhuxian (聊城), a vigorous land reform movement was launched in conjunction with the struggle against traitors and revenge. Within ten days, from February 5th to 14th, all areas of the county initially broke open the situation. At the beginning of the movement, the masses in various places demanded to speak out about their suffering and seek revenge. The leadership adapted to the urgent demands of the masses, using administrative power to coordinate with the actions of the masses, punishing more than 30 heinous traitors and spies, removing the stumbling blocks to the movement, enlivening the emotions of the masses, and opening up the situation. In terms of methods, the first step was to convene peasant associations and meetings of activists for training and mobilization, with a total of more than 40,000 people trained. Joint struggles were carried out on the scale of small districts. The momentum of the movement was immense, with more than 100,000 farmers involved in the movement, and they have already begun to gain benefits. On the 12th, the First District first convened a conference of more than 4,000 activists to accuse Ma Fenglin, a traitorous landlord from Gehai. During the struggle in Gehai, 28 out of 30 households in Yangzhuang spoke out about their suffering. On the 9th, the Ninth District convened a meeting of 4,000 people to struggle against the local tyrant Sun Wenzhang, and the masses confiscated his property. After the Sixth District convened a meeting of more than 6,500 activists, on the 17th, in Kun Guantun in the South District, they accused Nie Xiangxi, the No. 1 ruling figure in the county who had served as a member of the Beijing Parliament. The situation in the entire district immediately opened up. On the 16th, the Eighth District convened a meeting of more than 7,000 people in Houying to accuse the local tyrant and traitor Ma Sanxiang. An older sister said, "He killed my four-month-old child, dragged away my eighteen-year-old son, and buried my seventy-year-old father alive, robbing all my family's belongings." Other districts have also successively carried out joint struggles, opening up the situation.
	In the joint struggle, the unified action created a great momentum, eliminating the masses' "change of dynasty" thinking and overwhelming the reactionary forces. In the distribution of fruits, it was also possible to solve the difficulties of small villages with poor land and, at the same time, help backward villages open up the situation. However, in actual action, several problems arose: 1. Advanced villages took over backward villages. 2. The masses in rich villages were unwilling to let things from their own villages go out, and at the same time, landlords tried to dedicate land to their own villages to escape the struggle; the masses in other villages felt that even if they struggled against the landlords in other villages, they would not be able to get much, so they were not active in the struggle. 3. The masses in this village always felt that the treatment of the landlords in this village was too harsh, while the treatment of the landlords in other villages was too lenient. After research by the leadership, in addition to vigorously carrying out the education of "Farmers all over the world are one family," it was decided to take different approaches based on different situations. In the Niguan Village area, each village discussed and reported the landlords who should be struggled against. In addition to jointly struggling against some large landlords and jointly distributing the fruits, the rest would be handled by each village itself. Villages in the Tan× area adopted the method of first discussing in the village and determining how much land and how many houses to give to the poor villages, and whatever was left, no matter how much was struggled out, would belong to this village. In general, the entire district still carried out joint struggles, but villages could indicate in advance that they did not need to attend certain struggles if they did not want to. The masses were very satisfied with the above method.

　　大力开展新收复区土地改革运动
    筑先全县局面打开
    十万农民反奸清算
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】筑先（聊城）解放后，结合反奸复仇掀起如火如荼的土地改革运动，在二月五日至十四日十天内，全县各区初步轰开局面。运动开始，各地群众纷纷要求诉苦复仇，领导上适应群众迫切要求，用行政力量配合群众行动，惩办了罪大恶极的汉奸特务三十余人，搬开了运动的绊脚石，活跃了群众情绪，打开了局面。作法上首先是召开农民会与积极分子会，进行训练动员，共训练了四万余人，以小区为单位进行联合斗争，运动声势浩大，十万余农民卷入运动，并已开始获得利益。一区于十二日首先召开四千余积极分子大会，控诉葛海一带汉奸地主马凤林。葛海斗争时，杨庄三十户就有二十八户诉苦。九区在九日召开了四千人的大会，斗争恶霸孙文章，群众并没收了他的家产。六区召开了六千五百余人的积极分子会后，十七日在南小区昆官屯控诉全县第一号统治人物当过北京议员的奸霸聂湘溪，全区局面立即轰开。八区在侯营于十六日召开了七千多人的大会，控诉恶霸、汉奸马三祥，一位大嫂说：“他搞死了我四个月的小孩子，拉走了我十八岁的儿子，又活埋了我七十多岁的老公公，把我家的东西全部抢走。”其他各区亦先后进行联合斗争，轰开局面。
    在联合斗争中，统一行动声势浩大，消除了群众的“变天”思想，压倒了反动势力；在分果实上也能解决小村贫土地少的困难，同时也帮助了落后村打开局面。但实际行动中却产生了几个问题：一、先进村包办落后村。二、富村的群众不愿叫本村的东西外出，同时地主为逃避斗争也想法把地献给本村；外村群众感到斗了他村地主也分不了多少东西，斗争也就不积极。三、本村的群众总嫌对本村的地主处理的重，对外村处理的轻。经领导上做了研究，除了大力进行“天下农民是一家”的教育外，确定根据不同的情况采取不同的处理。在倪官屯一带，由各村讨论自报应斗的地主，除统一斗一部分大地主，统一分果实外，其余由各村自己处理。谭×一带村庄，采取先由当村讨论，确定给贫村多少土地、多少房子，下余的不论斗出多少，一概归本村。全小区一般的仍是联合斗争，但那村预先说明那一次斗争不需去时，可以不去。以上这个办法群众都很满意。
