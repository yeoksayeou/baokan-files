    Chiang and Hu's Troops Invade Our Eastern Gansu in Separate Routes
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st -- While Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense denies attacking Yan'an, the military actions of Chiang and Hu's troops against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are becoming increasingly active. Confirmed sources report: Chiang and Hu's troops began attacking Qingyang, the capital of the Longdong sub-region of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, in two routes yesterday morning (February 28th). One route attacked the town southwest of Qingyang at 8:00 AM. Our army proactively withdrew from the area, and Chiang and Hu's troops continued to advance towards Qingyang via Guojia Yao. The other route attacked a town fifty li away from Qingyang, and after occupying the town, divided their forces to attack Baimapu (forty li southwest of Qingyang), Banqiao Town, and other places.
