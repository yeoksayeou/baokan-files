    Dongping Sixth District, Shahe Station Area
    Canal Detachment Wins Repeated Victories
    [Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region) Dispatch, 19th] In early March, the Canal Detachment organized by the Seventh Military Sub-district Command and the Commissioner's Office's Armed Work Team won three battles in three engagements in the Shahe Station area, Sixth District of Dongping. On the 4th, over a hundred men from Chiang's 96th Division of the Fifth Army arrived at Shahe Station to seize grain. The Commissioner's Office's Armed Work Team launched a surprise attack and routed them. On the morning of the 5th, a squad of Chiang's troops from Mazhuang went to the Shahe Station area to loot, but were ambushed by the Canal Detachment, capturing two enemy soldiers and seizing two American-style rifles and over a hundred rounds of ammunition. On the 7th, over twenty Chiang's troops from Nanxinzhuang again went to the area to seize grain and were once more routed by the Canal Detachment, which captured one American-style machine gun and one American-style rifle, killing one enemy soldier and capturing another. On the 8th, Chiang's troops advanced on the Shahe Station area with two battalions divided into three routes in an attempt to retaliate, but our guerrillas had already moved. Thanks to the active operations of our Canal Detachment and the Commissioner's Office's Armed Work Team, small groups of Chiang's troops no longer dare to attack. Residents who had fled from both the north and south banks of the Weizi River in the Fifth District of Dongping have returned home one after another, and special agents no longer dare to operate. Prices have fallen rapidly; for example, the price of steamed buns has dropped from 400 yuan per catty to 200 yuan per catty.

    东平六区沙河站一带
    运河支队连战连捷
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】七分区司令部所组织之运河支队与专署武工队于本月初旬，在东平六区沙河站一带三战三捷。四日，曹桥蒋第五军九十六师百余人到沙河站抢粮，专署武工队以突击将其击溃。五日晨马庄蒋军一个班又到沙河站一带抢劫、遭运河支队伏击，俘敌二名，缴美式步枪两支，子弹百余发。七日，南新庄蒋军二十余人再至该地抢粮，又遭运河支队击溃，缴美式机步枪各一，毙俘各一。八日蒋军以两营兵力分三路进犯沙河站一带，企图报复，但我游击队早已转移。由于我运河支队与专署武工队积极活动，小股蒋军已不敢出犯。东平五区苇子河南北两岸外出逃难之居民相继返家，特务亦不敢活动，物价急速下降，如馍每斤即由四百元降至二百元。
