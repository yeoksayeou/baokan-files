Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: Moscow dispatch: At the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Molotov recently delivered an important statement on the issue of Germany's provisional political institutions and put forward the following proposals. The form and scope of Germany's provisional political institutions should be resolved according to the following principles: (1) Germany's political institutions must be democratic in nature, and state organs must be established on the basis of democratic elections. (2) The centralized state organs of Hitler's Germany, which destroyed the parliament and local autonomous governments, must be thoroughly eliminated; the decentralized governments that existed before Hitler's rule must be re-established, and Germany's bicameral parliament must be restored. (3) This provisional German government must be established on the basis of guaranteeing Germany's political and economic unity, and must be able to fulfill Germany's obligations to the Allied countries. In order to implement the above tasks, it is now suggested that as the first step in forming the provisional German government, the German central administrative departments in charge of finance, industry, transportation, communications, and foreign trade must be formed in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The Allied Control Council, together with representatives from Germany's democratic parties, free trade unions, and other anti-fascist and anti-Nazi groups and various regions, should draft a provisional democratic constitution. Elections should be held in accordance with this provisional constitution, and a provisional German government should be formed accordingly. In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the German government must be tasked with eliminating militarism and fascism and implementing Germany's genuine democratization as its basic tasks, and must also implement measures to rehabilitate the German economy and unconditionally fulfill Germany's obligations to the Allied countries. The provisional German constitution should be approved by the German people. Germany should once again become a peaceful and democratic republic, with a German parliament including two houses. The rights of the German states that conform to the constitution must be guaranteed. The President of the German Republic must be elected by the parliament. The constitution passed by the German parliament should be implemented throughout Germany. The German constitution and local constitutions should be based on democratic principles. The German constitution and local constitutions will guarantee the formation and activities of all democratic parties and trade unions and other democratic public organizations, and will guarantee German citizens' freedom of speech, publication, religion, belief, assembly, and association, regardless of their race, gender, or spoken language. The German parliament and local parliaments will be elected on the basis of universal, equal, and direct elections using secret ballots in accordance with the proportional representation system. Local autonomous governments (county, district, and urban and rural committees) will be elected on the same democratic basis as local parliaments.
