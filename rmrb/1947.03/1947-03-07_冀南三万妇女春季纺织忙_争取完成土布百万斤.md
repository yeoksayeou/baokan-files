　　[This report from our Jinnan office, dated the 5th] The emancipated women of Southern Hebei have begun their spring spinning and weaving campaign, with the goal of completing one million jin of cloth to support the front lines and earn wages to overcome the difficulties of spring plowing. In Ji Ze, over 30,000 emancipated women who have undergone land reform have enthusiastically joined the wave of spinning and weaving. In Junzhai Village, eighteen spinning and weaving groups, consisting of one hundred and seventy-eight women, have woven ninety bolts of cloth in half a month since the second day of the first lunar month, with thread for thirty more bolts still to be woven. The women in Da Hanggu Village are all weaving, and impoverished women who have received grain say, "Thanks to the government for coming up with this idea; we don't have to worry about eating or farming this spring." In Li Machang, groups of sisters aged thirteen or fourteen, and old ladies aged sixty or seventy, have all been spinning and weaving since the second day of the first lunar month. Last year, the women of Wu Guanying Village wove and sold 2,478 bolts of cloth, earning a year's worth of public grain (53,075 jin) and an additional 20,000 jin of grain, totaling the equivalent of the autumn harvest. The women of the village recently decided to complete six hundred bolts of cloth by the end of the first lunar month. When they heard the call from higher authorities to spin and weave to supply the front lines, every woman worked even harder day and night. The twenty-five-member spinning and weaving group led by the women's association director of Yuanchao Fangge Village has been cooperating since the spring of 1944, and their family economies have all improved. The women's association director composed a song to teach everyone: "Spinning and weaving for three years, earning grain and earning money, who gave us these benefits? Chairman Mao's leadership saved us." At the Wuxun Xingda Collective mutual aid spinning and weaving symposium, the women's association director said, "We all come from poor backgrounds, and we are not afraid of straining our eyes and suffering; after being emancipated, we must work hard to build our homes." Young women said, "We must produce well to be considered improved." An old lady, a family member of a martyr in Da Liuzhuang, wove eighteen bolts of cloth in half a year, greatly improving her life. In Xingjiading Village, Hengshui, a nine-year-old girl can spin four and a half liang of thread per day. In Bi Dian, a woman can weave forty city feet of cloth per day. In some villages, spinning and weaving groups have established homespun cloth cooperatives to uniformly collect homespun cloth and promote its sale.
