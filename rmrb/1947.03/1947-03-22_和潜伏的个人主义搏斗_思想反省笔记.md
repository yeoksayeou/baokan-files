    Fighting Latent Individualism
    Reflections on Thought
    Wei Yu
     II. Without the intention to be content with one's lot, there is a mind prone to change.
    After Japan's surrender, I requested to come to the front lines, saying it was to participate in the intense combat work and the earth-shaking mass movement. Having arrived here, I then requested to go to my hometown area, saying it was for the localization of cadres, always thinking: local cadres always have more advantages than outside cadres; they understand the situation in their work, connect with the masses, live close to home, are familiar with the people and the place, and are valued by the leadership, and they have and should have certain priorities in use and promotion. This kind of thinking seems half-public and half-private, close to human sentiment; in reality, it is valuing the private over the public, using the public for private gain. It starts from the individual, always wanting to seek a comfortable environment. I should warn myself: a person who wholeheartedly serves the people should let himself obey the organization, not let the organization obey himself; he should think less about his own convenience and more about the interests of the Party. He should restrain himself to adapt to the environment and should not demand that the environment adapt to him. If one does not combine personal plans with the revolutionary cause, and always thinks that "the grass is always greener on the other side of the hill," then one will eventually end up in a situation of "wandering far and wide, with no skills to rely on."
    III. Covert Egalitarianism
    Whenever hard struggle is mentioned, one always looks upwards, demanding that everyone be the same, lacking the spirit of self-reliance, and first achieving sharing joys and hardships with the soldiers. This kind of "comparing" thinking, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "It does not start from the overall interest, but from individual interests." Comparing upwards like this, one feels the disparity is too great; comparing to the middle, one feels that happiness and suffering are not evenly distributed. One feels that it's the same revolution, so why have I become "proletarian," in poverty and disease, while some people happen to have a lot of money and live comfortably? Isn't this the honest person suffering? The problem here is comparing upwards and to the middle, but never downwards; comparing living enjoyment, but never work or contribution. Since the Self-Defense War, the Party has called for changing the usual way of life, advocating hard struggle, and sharing joys and hardships with the soldiers. Many leading comrades have set an example by abolishing small stoves, and the difference in living standards has long been very small. But I am still haggling over it, not thinking about how to be more frugal and work hard to produce and set a model role. This is truly individualism at work.

    和潜伏的个人主义搏斗
    思想反省笔记
    畏予
     二、无随遇而安之意，有见异思迁之心。
    日本投降后，要求到前方来，说是为了参加紧张战斗的工作与翻天复地的群运。既到此间，又要求到家乡地区，说是为了干部地方化，心里老是在想：本地干部总是比外来干部占便宜得多，工作上了解情况。联系群众，生活上接近家乡，人地熟悉，领导上也重视本地干部，使用与提拔上也有而且应有某些优先权。这种想法，好像半公半私，近乎人情；实际上是轻公重私，借公济私的打算，是从个人出发，到处想寻求适意的环境。应当警告自己：全心全意为人民服务的人，应当让自己服从组织，不应让组织服从自己，应当少从自己的便利打算，而要多为党的利益着想。应当约束自己去适应环境，不应当要求环境来适应自己。如果不把个人打算结合于革命事业之中，老是“这山望着那山高”，那最后会落到，“远走高飞，无技可依”的境地的。
    三、藏头露尾的平均主义
    一提艰苦奋斗，总是往上看，要求大家一样，缺乏自我作起的精神，首先作到与士卒同甘苦。这种“比一比”的想法，正如刘少奇同志所说：“它不是从整个利益出发，而是从个人利益出发，”这样向上一比，觉得悬殊太大，向中一比，觉得苦乐不均。觉得一样的革命，为什么我变成“无产阶级”处于贫病交加，而有些人偏偏有很多钱，生活裕如呢？这难道不是老实人吃亏吗？这里的毛病是比上比中偏偏没有往下比，比生活享受偏偏没有比工作、比功劳。自卫战争以来，党号召改变平时的生活方式，提倡艰苦奋斗，与士卒同甘苦，许多领导同志以身作则，自动取消小灶，生活上的差别早就很小了。而自己偏还在斤斤较量，不去想如何更克苦节约，努力生产来起模范作用，这实在是个人主义作祟。
