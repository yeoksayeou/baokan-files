Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, 27th: Xinhua News Agency correspondent Li Puqing, in an article titled "The Tactics of the Eighth Route Army," commented on the situation in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield, saying: General Liu Bocheng's dragging of Chiang Kai-shek's Wang Jingjiu Group back to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield while they were en route to aid Southern Shandong is the biggest gain from General Liu's second attack on the Longhai Railway. In mid-August of last year, General Liu launched his first attack on the Longhai Railway, attracting approximately 70,000 of Chiang's troops, including Wang Jingjiu, from the Southern Jiangsu, Shandong, and Central Plains battlefields, greatly reducing the burden on other fraternal units. In the past six months, after approximately 60,000 of Chiang's troops from the Wang Jingjiu and Wang Zhonglian groups and other Chiang's troops were annihilated, they advanced to the Daming and Nanle area. In January, General Liu launched an attack on southwestern Shandong, recovering many county towns such as Juancheng and Chengwu, cutting off Wang Jingjiu's rear, and dragging the Wang Jingjiu and Wang Zhonglian groups back to the Longhai Railway. Furthermore, he recovered seven county towns south of the Longhai Railway, causing fear and confusion among Chiang's troops. Chiang Kai-shek deeply felt that his forces had been dispersed over the past nine months and that his vital forces had been heavily annihilated everywhere. Therefore, he attempted to adopt a policy of focusing on key points in order to reverse the declining trend. At the end of January, he began to piece together his forces and launched a large-scale concentrated offensive against Southern Shandong, attempting to first eliminate General Chen Yi's main force, and then concentrate his attack on General Liu Bocheng. Unexpectedly, just as the Wang Jingjiu Group was hurrying east, General Liu launched his second attack on the Longhai Railway, dragging him back again. General Liu Bocheng neither allowed them to open up the Pinghan Railway nor allowed them to go to Shandong; Chiang Kai-shek lost this move again. Now, after advancing in large strides, General Liu is retreating in large strides again. The strategic mission has now been accomplished. He has proactively withdrawn from several empty cities such as Shanxian, Chengwu, and Dingtao. The Wang (Wang Jingjiu, Wang Zhonglian) Groups paid the price of more than 3,000 casualties for invading these cities, and their forces could not help but be dispersed, and their supply lines could not help but be extended. General Liu is once again confusing them, and they do not know what magical plans General Liu is making again. Although they are boasting loudly, they are terrified in their hearts. Last year, they still had many other troops to protect each other and advance side by side; there were also many puppet county security regiments and "homecoming corps" to defend their rear, suppress the democratic movement, search for conscripts, and requisition grain. Now, most of these pawns have been annihilated or are incomplete. Chiang Kai-shek's empty-shell strategy has lost this supporting force and has to assign its own mobile forces to share the task of defending and maintaining the long transportation line. Our local armed forces and rear enemy troops have gained the conditions for free movement. The Wang (Wang Jingjiu, Wang Zhonglian) Groups are also increasingly anxious after a long journey; therefore, who knows, one day, they will encounter the fate of total annihilation like Zhao Xitian, Liu Guangxin, or Yang Xianming. Advancing and retreating in large strides, not sticking to fixed front lines, not dispersing forces to defend cities to the death, but concentrating at any time to prepare for annihilating the enemy's vital forces time and time again - this is the tactic of the Eighth Route Army. This is assembling and waiting for an opportunity, not passive waiting, but actively mobilizing the enemy, creating the enemy's mistakes, and exposing the enemy's weaknesses. Doesn't the current situation clearly illustrate this point?

　　刘伯承将军所部大踏步进退
    迫使蒋军南北奔波完全被动
    新华社记者评冀鲁豫形势
    【本报冀鲁豫前线廿七日电】新华社特派员李普顷以“八路军的战法”为题，评述冀鲁豫战场的形势说：蒋军王敬久集团奉命驰援鲁南的途中，被刘伯承将军拖回冀鲁豫战场，这是最近刘将军第二次出击陇海路的最大收获。去年八月中旬，刘将军第一次出击陇海路，把包括王敬久在内的蒋军约七万之众从苏北、山东和中原战场吸引过来，大大减轻了其他兄弟部队的负担。半年来，王敬久和王仲廉两集团在其他蒋军约六万之众被歼灭以后，进到大名、南乐一带。刘将军于一月间出击鲁西南，收复巨野、城武等许多县城，切断王敬久的后路，把王敬久、王仲廉两集团拖回到陇海路上；并在陇海路南收复了七个县城，引起了蒋军的恐惧与混乱。蒋介石深感九个月来兵力分散，有生力量处处遭到大量歼灭，因此企图改取重点主义，以图挽回颓势。于一月底开始拚凑兵力，大举集中进攻鲁南。妄想首先消灭陈毅将军主力，再集中进攻刘伯承将军，不料正当王敬久集团急忙东调之时，刘将军第二次出击陇海路，又把他拖了回来。刘伯承将军既不许他们打通平汉路，也不许他们到山东去；这一着蒋介石又输了。现在，刘将军在大踏步前进之后，又大踏步后退。战略任务现已达成了。主动撤出了单县、城武、定陶等几座空城。两王（王敬久、王仲廉）集团侵占了这些城市，即付出了三千以上伤亡的代价；而且兵力不能不分散，补给线不能不延长。刘将军又在迷惑他们，他们不知道刘将军又在作什么神奇的打算。他们口里虽然大吹大擂，内心却是心惊胆战。去年，他们还有其他许多部队互为护卫，齐头并进；还有许多伪县保安团和“还乡团”为他们守备后方，镇压民主运动，搜抓壮丁，征发粮食。现在，这些爪牙则大部被歼灭，或者残缺不全了。蒋介石的空心战略失去了这种支持的力量，不得不把自己的机动部队分担防守和维持漫长的交通线的任务。而我地方武装和敌后兵团获得了机动自如的条件。两王（王敬久、王仲廉）集团也在长途奔波之后益感焦虑；因此，说不定那一天，他们就要遭遇赵锡田、刘广信或者杨显明那样全军覆灭的命运。大踏步进退，不胶着于固定的战线，不分散兵力以死守城市，随时集中起来，准备一次又一次地歼灭敌人的有生力量，这就是八路军的战法。这是集结待机，不是消极的等待，而是积极的调动敌人，创造敌人的错误，暴露敌人的弱点。目前的形势不是清清楚楚说明了这一点吗？
