　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Moscow Dispatch: Pravda diplomatic commentator, Sakov, recently wrote an article stating that the recent conspiracies of Hitler bandits discovered in the American and British occupation zones of Germany, as well as the attempts by war criminal defense lawyers in the Tokyo trial to prove the justice of Japanese aggression and slander the Allied countries, are all due to the fact that Fascism still enjoys lenient treatment from the occupying authorities. The Berlin newspaper, Neues Deutschland, commenting on the Nazi underground organizations uncovered in the American and British occupation zones, pointed out that Nazi groups have not been eliminated. As long as reactionary forces do not leave their key positions in the economic spheres of western and southern Germany, such underground movements will again find new supporters and organizers.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th.

　　真理报外交评论家指责
    美英占领区纳粹活动
    【新华社延安七日电】莫斯科讯：真理报外交评论家萨科夫，顷著文称：最近在德国美英占领区发现的希特勒匪徒的阴谋，以及东京审判中战犯辩护人企图证明日本侵略为正义及诽谤盟国的活动，都是由于法西斯主义依然享受着占领当局宽厚待遇的结果。柏林新德意志报在评及美英占领区所破获之纳粹地下组织时，指出纳粹集团并未被扫除。只要反动势力一日不离开德国西部与南部经济领域中之关键地位，则此种地下运动便会再次的找到新的支持者与组织者。
    【新华社延安五日电】塔斯社讯：柏林人报顷于抨击德境英占区多如牛毛的保守与反动党派时称：此等党派已被准予出版报纸、杂志保有党的俱乐部，他们的领袖们均受来路不明方面人士之津贴，他们可以召开党代表大会，在会上出现的是纳粹的口号。
