    The Newly Recovered Areas of Qingfeng
    General Liquidation for Revenge Against Traitors
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 19th dispatch] With the strong support of the democratic government, the people of Qingfeng have combined the movement of revenge against traitors with the movement of returning houses and land. After the city was recovered, the masses strongly demanded revenge, but some cadres had a "rest" mentality after fighting as guerrillas. After checking the work, they immediately changed and actively supported the masses. Each district held activist meetings and mass rallies, arrested bad elements, and confiscated their property for the masses. District Chief Guo of the Tenth District led the masses of more than a dozen villages to confiscate the property of the worst speculator, Liu Xitang, and others, breaking the deadlock. The district chief of the Eighth District led the district team and the masses to confiscate the real estate and land of Zhang Junmin, a local tyrant and special agent of Chiang Kai-shek, and handed it all over to the masses. Xiyangshao Village in the Eighth District struggled against the big landlord Su Qingze, and struggled to obtain land, farm tools, etc. The masses said: "Having avenged our hatred and divided the land, we will follow the Communist Party to the death."

    反奸复仇总清算
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】在民主政府大力支持下，清丰人民结合反奸复仇开展房地还家运动。该城收复后，群众强烈要求复仇，但有些干部存在打游击后的“休息”思想；经检查工作后，即转变积极分给群众撑腰，各区召开积极分子会及群众大会，将坏分子加以逮捕，并没收其财产给群众。十区郭区长带了十几个村的群众没收了最坏的投机分子刘西堂等的财产，打开了消沉局面。八区区长带领区队和群众没收了蒋特恶霸张俊民的房产地土，全部交给群众。八区西阳邵村向大地主苏庆泽斗争，斗出土地农具等，群众说：“报了仇分了地，死也跟着共产党走。”
