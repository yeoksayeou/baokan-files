　　US, Britain Undermine the Potsdam Agreement
    Conduct Private Transactions in German Occupation Zones
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Reports from various sources: US and British officials announced on the 24th that private commercial transactions between the US, Britain, Belgium, and Luxembourg (on the one hand) and the US and British occupation zones in Germany (on the other hand) will begin on March 4th. It is understood that the Soviet Union and France did not participate in this action. According to the Potsdam Conference's resolutions, Germany during the occupation period should be treated as a single economic unit, and the policy regarding Germany's overall import and export should be jointly formulated by the four powers.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] Tokyo dispatch: The US occupation authorities announced on the afternoon of the 22nd that former German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, has been released from prison and will return to Germany with German expatriates in Japan. Stahmer was the head of Nazi Germany's secret police in the East during the war and served as the German Ambassador to the puppet government in Nanjing in 1942.
