　　[This dispatch from our newspaper's office in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 17th:] Belated news: Chiang's troops, who had once again invaded Chengwou and Juancheng, were constantly attacked by the People's Liberation Army at their strongholds and along transportation lines. They were forced to flee in panic on the 26th of last month, and the aforementioned two cities were liberated. Currently, the Chiang troops in Dingtao, Caoxian, Juye, Yuncheng, and other places are besieged in empty cities under the constant attacks of our guerrillas, and they dare not leave their nests for even half a step.

　　[This dispatch from our newspaper's front line in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 17th:] The People's Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Ningyang City on the 9th. The invading troops occupying the city were Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn Fifth Army.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 14th:] (Belated) After the Jiaodong Field Army of the East China People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 2,000 men of Chiang's Eighth Army in Shahe (southwest of Yexian) from the latter part of last month, they took advantage of the victory to clear the remaining enemies along the Yantai-Weifang line and swept across the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway. From the 28th of last month to the 1st of March, within 54 hours, they completely destroyed the Chiang army's solid defense line, which stretched for over a hundred miles from Hama Village (more than fifty li southeast of Weixian) in the west to Gaomi City in the east. The entire defending force, the 15th Traffic Police Corps of Chiang's army and the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Regiment of Chiang's puppet Bao Yi Division, were wiped out. More than 2,000 enemy soldiers were captured alive, including Major General Zhang Guliang, the Chief Commander of the 15th Traffic Police Corps, and Vice Commander Chen Haowei. More than 600 were killed or wounded. Gaomi, Changyi, Jiaoxian and more than twenty important towns and stations were recovered in one fell swoop, and vast areas were liberated again. A total of twelve cannons of various types, seventy light and heavy machine guns, and one thousand one hundred and seventy rifles and carbines were seized.
