　　Tensions Rise in Diplomacy Before Moscow Conference
    Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Draw Closer, the United States Will Undoubtedly Be Isolated
    The Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference is about to convene next week. The preparatory work and diplomatic activities of the countries concerned surrounding the conference have recently presented a tense and busy picture. After much negotiation, the Allied Control Council in Berlin completed its report on the progress of controlling Germany on the 24th. The London Foreign Ministers' Representatives Conference also drafted a report on procedures for dealing with Germany and the Franco issue as scheduled on the 25th. Both reports contain agreed and disagreed parts, and will be submitted to the Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. The departure dates of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France attending this conference have all been confirmed. Moscow is about to become a world-renowned political center.

    In the run-up to this Moscow conference, many noteworthy events have occurred in the relations between the four powers in the past week.

    First, let's look at the Soviet Union. Soviet newspapers have recently sharply criticized the American and British reactionaries for violating the Potsdam Agreement in the German occupation zones, and the United States for violating the decisions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference of the previous year in China, Korea, and Japan. This indicates that adhering to the decisions of past conferences is the Soviet Union's unwavering attitude. At the same time, the Soviet Union announced on the 26th its conditional agreement to the United States' trusteeship of the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific, and agreed to discuss the US settlement of Lend-Lease materials to the Soviet Union. This open and benevolent attitude has undoubtedly won greater sympathy from world public opinion.

    Looking at Britain again, unlike previous international conferences last year, no obvious anti-Soviet remarks have been seen from British officials before this conference; on the contrary, the fact has confirmed that the British-Soviet treaty revision discussions are underway. At the same time, the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty was signed on March 4. According to a US news agency report on the 28th, "The Anglo-French alliance completes the triangular relationship of mutual guarantees between the Soviet Union, Britain, and France." On the other hand, Britain's attitude towards the United States has changed. Bevin publicly rebuked Truman in the House of Commons on the 26th for undermining the resolution of the Palestine issue. Such a fierce dispute is the first in post-war British-American relations. Naturally, Bevin also said in a speech in the House of Commons on the 27th: "British-American relations are the most friendly," but according to some British diplomats, Bevin's dispute with Truman will weaken the cooperation between the two countries at the Foreign Ministers Conference. It is still recalled that the debate on British domestic and foreign policies triggered by the coal shortage is still ongoing. Contrary to the proposition of some right-wing capitalists to "rely more on the United States," the British Communist Party, the left wing of the Labour Party, and even some capitalists have called for the immediate conclusion of mutually beneficial trade agreements with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to seek self-reliance.

    As for France, it has suffered from German aggression three times in the past 75 years. The French people naturally urgently hope for the success of the Moscow Conference. French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez, in his speech on the 23rd, particularly emphasized the need for France to guarantee that it would not be invaded again. French Prime Minister Ramadier's remarks on the 27th also unprecedentedly clarified France's position on the Moscow Conference. Ramadier said: "France, Britain, and the Soviet Union have engaged in negotiations and may soon form a solid alliance among the three. France may become a mediator among the three in Moscow, trying to create a harmonious atmosphere."

    In this complex situation, Marshall, as the US Secretary of State, remained silent for a month and a half on the major issues related to this conference since taking office, and only expressed his attitude on February 25. On the one hand, he declared that the US policy toward Germany "remains as elucidated by the Potsdam Declaration," and on the other hand, he said that the US policy toward Germany "remains as elucidated by Byrnes in his Stuttgart speech," while the spirit of that speech ran counter to the Potsdam Declaration. At the same time, observing Marshall's announcement to accelerate the transfer of surplus materials in the Western Pacific and US-donated ships to the Chiang government, and the decision to accompany Republican anti-Soviet expert Dulles to the Soviet Union, as well as the US authorities' recent active reactionary measures in countries such as Korea and Japan, will undoubtedly cause great difficulties for the Moscow Conference. However, these words and deeds of the US authorities are enough to reflect their outward strength but inner weakness. Truman convened Marshall, Acheson, and the leaders of both houses of Congress on the 27th to discuss foreign policy issues in secret. According to the Associated Press, Truman appealed at the meeting to the leaders of the two parties in Congress to attend the Moscow Conference with Marshall, fearing that its weakness would be exposed, which is clear evidence.

    Looking at the above, it is not difficult for people to see that: mainly due to the attitude of the United States, there are still many difficulties facing the Moscow Conference. However, judging from the recent signs that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are moving closer, the United States will undoubtedly become isolated. This is the bright side of the prospects for the Moscow Conference. The pessimistic atmosphere spread by the American and British reactionary newspapers before the conference only proves that they are good at destroying the cause of peace.

### 莫斯科会议前外交呈现紧张  英法苏三国日趋接近美国无疑将陷于孤立

　　莫斯科会议前外交呈现紧张
    英法苏三国日趋接近美国无疑将陷于孤立
    莫斯科四国外长会议下周就要召开了，围绕会议的各项准备工作和有关国家的外交活动，近来呈现出一幅紧张忙碌的图景。柏林盟国管制委员会在多方折冲之后，已于二十四日完成管制德国进展情形的报告。伦敦外长代表会议亦于二十五日如期草成对德程序及对佛郎哥问题的报告。这两个报告都包含有已获协议和未获协议的部分，一并送交外长会议讨论。出席这一会议的美英法三国外长的行期，均已确定。莫斯科即将成为举世瞩目的政治中心了。
    在这莫斯科会议前夕，一周来四强关系中发生了许多值得注意的事件。
    先看苏联，苏联报纸最近曾尖锐的抨击美英反动派在德境占领区违背波茨顿决定，美国在中国、朝鲜以及日本违反前年莫斯科外长会议的决定，这表示坚持历次决定，是苏联坚定不移的态度。同时，苏联又于二十六日宣布有条件的同意美国托管太平洋前日委任统治岛屿，并同意讨论美对苏租借物资清算问题。这种磊落善意的态度，无疑博得世界舆论的更大的同情。
    再看英国，和去年各次国际会议不同，英官方在这次会议之前，未见有明显的反苏言论；相反的，事实已证实英苏两国修约讨论正进行中。同时，英法同盟条约已订于三月四日签字。据美新闻处二十八日评称：“英法盟约完成了苏英法三大国相互保证的三角关系”。另一方面，英国对美国的态度却有了变化。贝文二十六日在下院公开斥责杜鲁门破坏了巴勒斯坦问题的解决。这样激烈的争执，还是战后英美关系中的首次。自然，贝文二十七日于下院演说中还说：“英美关系最为友善”，但是据英国某些外交家预料，贝文与杜鲁门这次争执，将削弱两国在外长会议上的合作。犹忆以煤荒为导火线而引起的英国内外政策的争论，现在还在斗争之中。与某些右派大资本家“更加依靠美国”的主张相反，英共、工党左翼甚至一部分资本家，则发出了立即与苏联及东欧诸国缔结互惠贸易协定，以谋自力更生的要求。
    至于法国，它在过去七十五年中，三次遭受德国的侵害，法国人民自然迫切希望莫斯科会议之成功。法共总书记多列士在其二十三日演说中，就特别强调法国保证不致再受侵略的必要。法总理拉氏二十七日的谈话，也空前明确说明法国对莫斯科会议的立场。拉氏说：“法、英、苏三国已从事谈判，可能很快将三者结成巩固的同盟。法国在莫斯科或将成为在三国之间充当调解人，尽力造成和谐的空气。”
    在这种复杂的处境里，作为美国国务卿的马歇尔，自其就任之日起，对有关此次会议的重大的问题，沉默一月又半，于二月二十五日始表示态度。他一方面声明美国对德政策“仍如波茨顿宣言所阐明者”，另一方面又谓美对德政策“仍如贝纳斯在斯图加特演说中所阐明者”，而该演说精神却是与波茨顿宣言背驰的。同时，观乎马歇尔声言加速将西太平洋剩余物资及美赠蒋舰船交给蒋政府，并决定偕共和党反苏专家杜勒斯赴苏，以及美当局近来在朝鲜、日本等国的积极反动措施，无疑将予莫斯科会议甚大之困难。但是，美国当局这些言行，适足以反映其外强中干。杜鲁门于二十七日召集马歇尔、亚泽逊及参众两院巨头密商外交问题。据合众社称：杜氏于会上吁请议会中两党领袖，与马歇尔一同去出席莫斯科会议，而唯恐其弱点暴露，即食明证。
    纵观上述，人们不难看出：主要由于美国的态度，莫斯科会议面前的困难还是不少的。但是揆之最近英法苏三国趋向接近的迹象，美国无疑将趋于孤立。这是莫斯科会议前途的光明面。美英反动派报纸在会议前所散布的悲观空气，只不过证明它原是以破坏和平事业为能事罢了。
