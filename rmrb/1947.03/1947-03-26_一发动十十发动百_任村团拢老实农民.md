    One mobilizes ten, ten mobilize a hundred
    The Ren village cadre unites with the honest farmers
    [This Newspaper reported] After boldly and freely resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses in Ren Village, Lin County, advanced masses and members of the Farmers' Association reflected: "The cadres have washed their faces and wiped off the dirt; our Ren Village will get things done this year!" They requested immediate action to clarify the landlords. The leadership then guided everyone by saying: "How should we carry out the struggle this year?" Activists said: "Let's carry out a general reckoning in the people's school!" Immediately, a count was taken, and only thirty-odd people from Second Street were automatically attending winter school, and the situation in other streets was similar. The leadership then induced everyone to recall past struggles, saying: "We have been fighting for a long time, why haven't we turned ourselves over completely?" A concrete calculation was made: "Second Street has more than 300 households in total, but only thirty-odd people are actively fighting. The landlords are stronger than us, so naturally things don't get done!" Activists determined that it was essential to unite with honest farmers. "How do we unite?" Fu Yuekui said: "I remember that year when District Cadre Liu Yuming mobilized me to join the Farmers' Association, it wasn't simple! I was initially afraid of being drafted into the army, but old Liu didn't mind the trouble and straightened out my thinking." Like this, everyone has an experience of moving from "backwardness" to progress. More than thirty activists automatically made self-criticisms, saying: "We can't blame the people for being backward, we can only blame ourselves for our poor work style and incorrect line. We would ask people ‘What are you thinking?’ every time! The first time we went to mobilize, we could see people, but the second time, you wouldn't even catch a glimpse of their shadow! We didn't even examine ourselves, and instead adopted an attitude and cursed people as 'dead dogs who can't be helped!' Honest farmers are naturally afraid to approach us!" They agreed on a rule: when going to mobilize honest farmers, first examine one's own past failings. One female activist even put forward a slogan: "When mobilizing women, treat the older ones as if they were our mothers, and the younger ones as if they were our sisters. Persuade them patiently and never adopt an attitude!" Male activists also put forward slogans such as "Treat the older ones as if they were our own fathers and uncles, and the younger ones as if they were our own brothers." Then they went to unite with the masses. Yuan Qiaohua and several other female activists united with poor peasant women everywhere, regardless of day or night. She went to Liu Yonghua's house time and time again, but never saw her. Later, she finally caught a glimpse of her coming back, but she was gone again when she entered the house. It turned out she was hiding in the cellar, with a pot on her head. When Yuan Qiaohua and two others helped her up, she was covered in sweat. Yuan Qiaohua said, both happily and ashamed: "Alas! Seeing us scares you more than seeing bandits?! This is all due to our poor work style in the past!" She carefully examined the "attitude" she had adopted and the times she had stamped her feet during the previous mobilization, and said in a good-natured voice: "We poor people only see other poor people as kin. Your family is poor, but you don't rise up to turn yourself over. In the past, I really wanted to bite you!" Then she brought up her own painful experiences of being a maidservant, begging for food, and being extorted by landlords. Liu Yonghua sighed deeply and said: "Speaking of this, my suffering is endless! It's just that I didn't realize this step in the past. When you came, you asked me ‘What are you thinking?’ and said I was ‘hopelessly backward,’ which scared me, I was really afraid of losing my life. Women explained things together, talking and laughing, and Liu Yonghua said: 'I will definitely go to winter school this afternoon.'" Six female activists from Second Street united forty-eight poor women in seven days. The women who rose up first and those who rose up later gave opinions to the men: "You men haven't mobilized enough yet, let's start a competition!" The men said: "Right!" The first, third, and fourth streets also launched a competition to unite the "honest."

  Delineate Class Lines, with Poor and Hired Peasants as the Main Force
    Unite to Overthrow the Landlords
    During the process of uniting, they divided the households that had turned themselves over, those that had not turned themselves over, and the middle peasant households into three groups for separate forums to delineate class lines and understand their thoughts. The middle peasant households compared their past and said: "We suffered quite a bit in the past. In the old society, the landlords didn't pay grain or taxes, it was all on our heads! Ever since the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party came, there has been disaster relief and reasonable burden-sharing. Chairman Mao's leadership is really good, and we have also turned ourselves over!" The households that had turned themselves over reflected on why they were active in the past but not now. They all said: "We felt that we had turned ourselves over, and thought: ‘Leveling and replenishing,’ there's nothing for us anyway, and we were too lazy to go to meetings, and even if we did, we would say little."
    Then, they reflected on history: "How did we turn ourselves over?" They realized that "relying on oneself alone doesn't get things done!" "We turned ourselves over with everyone's help, but we abandoned our poor brothers! We are really ungrateful!" Some people used an analogy: "Leveling and replenishing is like our mutual aid group. People work for you, and you don't reciprocate, it's all recorded!" Looking back at the fact that the landlords hadn't been thoroughly struggled against, they felt that their turning over wasn't complete, saying: "Watch, from now on in mutual aid and turning over, I will definitely charge forward!" The poor and hired peasants who hadn't turned themselves over said: "This year, when they said 'leveling and replenishing,' I thought that even if I didn't want to turn myself over this year, it wouldn't work, and the cadres have washed their faces and wiped off the dirt, and it feels even more like it's not a problem. Even if we don't go, won't they still 'replenish' our family!" When reflecting on how to get the landlords' things out, and whether it would be easy to get them out, they felt that they had to rise up and struggle. Then they discussed whether doing it alone would work. They said it wouldn't work and proposed: "Find our old大哥(elder brother) (households that turned themselves over last year) for experience, and unite the poor, hired, and middle peasants for strength!" Then, at the general meeting, they asked the households that had turned themselves over and the middle peasants: "You took the stone slabs off your bodies and left us behind. This time we want to struggle and turn ourselves over, will you help us?" "Help!" The households that had turned themselves over said: "We forgot who dug the well when we were drinking the water! That's really wrong! From now on, we will definitely help everyone turn themselves over completely!" The middle peasants said: "We thought we were targets of struggle in the past, and we weren't of one mind with everyone. We didn't mention our opinions about the landlords and even preserved the landlords' packages of grain and other items. From now on, we will overthrow the landlords together with everyone." Seeing that the time had come, the cadre asked: "Just saying 'struggle and turn yourselves over,' do you have any opinions?" They said: "Yes, lots!" Asked: "Who are you preparing to struggle against?" Everyone was silent for a moment. Town Chief Su Yutian stood up and said: "Let's struggle against my father-in-law first!" Armed Committee Director Wang Qingfa said: "Let's struggle against my uncle first!" Everyone said: "Right, we were preparing to struggle against the two of them!" The atmosphere of the meeting became lively again. After deliberation, it was decided to struggle against seven landlords, despots, and secret agents. The next morning, eight venues were set up on one main street, and the poor and hired peasants themselves presided over the venues. Men struggled against the men in the landlord's families, and women struggled against the women in the landlord's families.

    During the day, they struggled against the landlords, and at night, they gathered at the winter school to discuss the situation, analyze and deliberate, reward new activists, and check who were still honest. Because during the struggle, everyone unanimously realized that: the most powerful thing is honest people rising up and telling the truth, which can best overthrow the landlords. They proposed: "Mobilize the backward layer by layer, struggle against the landlords batch by batch, mobilize as you struggle, one mobilizes ten, ten mobilize a hundred, leaving no one behind, and thoroughly overthrowing the landlords!" Thus, Gu Wenju went back to straighten out his wife's thinking, saying: "You say I'm ruthless in struggling against the landlords, but don't you think about how much beating and scolding your father suffered from the landlord when he was a servant (long-term worker)?" His wife suddenly understood and automatically went to winter school to participate in the complaining and struggling. Peng Xi went back and held a family meeting, saying: "Why did our family move three times in one year? Where did everything we worked so hard for go?" This raised the whole family's awareness. In one family of fourteen in Second Street, there were still nine backward women. The men and women members of the Farmers' Association in his family competed to mobilize them. In the end, they were all mobilized. After they rose up, they went to mobilize other backward women. Later, the four streets of winter schools were packed every night, with each winter school increasing from dozens of people to four or five hundred people.
  
    Unite with Awareness, Speak Carefully and Listen Patiently
    Small Opinions Are Genuine Suffering
    Because the poor and honest peasants suffered too much oppression in the past, and a life of enduring humiliation for a long time made them afraid of showing their faces and afraid of speaking, therefore, in addition to enlightening the cadres and old activists to "unite with awareness" and understand the principles of "small opinions are genuine suffering" and "speak carefully and listen patiently" and avoid hurting their self-esteem, the leaders also had to timely praise various models and gradually consolidate their awareness ideologically. Since the day they struggled against the seven landlords, several new activists (including poor and middle peasants) voluntarily offered the things the landlords had hidden in their homes and were praised. Then more than 30 honest peasants automatically offered things up. Models were selected for each struggle, and by the end of the movement, a total of 654 male and female models had been selected in the village. Some of the newly emerging poor hired activists were elected as group leaders of the Farmers' Association, and some were elected as appraisers, custodians, and so on. The social status of the poor and hired peasants has been improved, and the role of the main force has become more and more prominent. (Zhan Chao)

    一发动十十发动百
    任村团拢老实农民
    【本报讯】林县任村经过大胆放手解决干群关系后，先进群众与农会会员都反映说：“干部洗了脸擦了黑，咱任村今年可要办事啦！”要求马上行动起来，澄清地主。领导上便引导大家说：“咱今年该怎个开展斗争？”积极分子说：“还是在民校里开展总清算吧！”当即点了点数，二街自动上冬学的才三十多人，其他街的情形也不相上下。领导上便诱导大家回想过去的斗争说：“咱一直闹斗争，为啥翻不透身？”具体算了算账“二街一共三百多户，积极斗争的才三十多个人，地主比咱力量大，自然不办事啦！”积极分子认定非团拢老实农民不可，“怎个团拢法呢？”傅月奎说：“想起那年区干部刘玉明动员俺参加农会，可不简单！俺开头光怕当了兵，人家老刘不害麻烦，才把俺的思想打通”。像这样从“落后”走向进步，谁都有一段经历，三十多个积极分子便自动检讨说：“不能怨人家落后，只怪咱作风不好，路线不对，动不动就问人家‘啥思想’？头回去动员还见人，二回去了连个影子也不叫你见！咱还不检讨自己，一味端起态度，骂人家‘死狗扶不上墙！’老实农民自然怕接近咱了！”便约定了一条：去家动员老实农民，先检讨检讨自己过去的败症，一妇女积极分子还提出一个口号：“动员妇女大的好比俺娘，小的好比俺姊妹，耐心说服动员，绝不起态度！”男积极分子也提出“大的好比俺亲爹亲大爷，小的好比俺亲兄弟”等口号。便分头团拢群众去了。袁巧花几个妇女积极分子，不分黑明昼夜到处团拢贫农妇女，她一趟一趟地上刘用花家，总是不见人，后来好容易才瞅见她回来了，进屋又不见了，原来她躲在地窖里，头上还顶个锅，待袁巧花三个人把他搀上时，已是满头大汗。袁巧花又高兴又惭愧的说：“唉！你见了俺们，比见胡掳队还害怕？！这都怨俺过去的作风不好啊！”把过去那次动员时“起态度，”那次跺脚的事，都细细检讨了一番，又好声好气地说：“咱穷人只见穷人亲，你家穷，又不起来翻身，过去俺真恨不得咬你两口！”便扯起自己过去当使女要饭受地主讹诈的痛苦来。刘用花长长的叹了口气说：“提起这吧，俺的痛苦扯也扯不完！就是过去没有觉悟到这步，你们一来就问俺‘啥思想’？又说俺‘落后的要命’，把俺吓蒙了，真怕要了命。妇女们在一起解释开，又是说又是笑，刘用花说：“俺后晌一定去冬学。”二街六个妇女积极分子，七天团拢了四十八个贫苦妇女。先起后起的妇女都向男人提意见：“你们男人动员可还不多，咱展开竞赛吧！”男人说：“对！”一、三、四街也开展一个团拢“老实”的竞赛。
  划清阶级贫雇为主  团结起来登展地主
    在团拢过程中，便把翻身户、没翻身户、中农户分成三下开座谈会，划阶级摸心思，中农户先比时光说：“俺们过去受的罪可不小，旧社会起粮起款地主不出，全压在咱头上了！自从来了八路军共产党，又是救济灾荒、又是合理负担，毛主席领导得真好啊，咱也是翻身啦！”翻身户反省为啥过去积极现在不积极？都说：“觉得咱翻身了，认为：‘填平补齐’反正没咱份，开会也懒得去，就是去了也少言语。”
    接着便从历史上反省：“咱是怎样翻身的？”觉悟到“光靠自己不办事！”“咱靠大家帮助翻了身，却把穷弟兄扔啦！真亏心！”有人打比喻说：“填平补齐就好比咱互助组，人家给你变工，你没有还工，都记上账哩！”反过来看地主都还没有斗透，更感到自己翻身不彻底说：“瞧着吧，从今往后互助翻身，俺一定打冲锋！”没翻身的贫雇农说：“今年一说是‘填平补齐’，俺心想今年就是不想翻身也不行，干部也洗脸擦黑啦，更觉得不成问题，咱就是不去吧，还不是一样要填到咱家！”当反省到地主东西怎样拿出来、好不好拿？便觉得非起来斗争不可，接着讨论光咱办事不办事？说不办事，提出：“经验少找咱老大哥（去年翻身户）、力量小贫雇中农团结成一坨！”便在全体大会上向翻身户和中农提出：“你们把身上石板揭了，只丢下俺们，这次俺们要斗争翻身，你们帮助不帮助？”“帮助！”翻身户说：“俺过去吃水忘了掏井人啦！真不对！今后一定帮助大家翻透身！”中农说：“俺们过去以为是斗争对象，与大家不一心，对地主有意见也不提，还给地主保存包袱粮食等件，从今往后要和大家一齐登展地主。”干部看见时机已到，便问：“光说斗争翻身，都有意见没有？”说：“有，多着哩！”问：“准备好斗争谁？”一时都沉默了。镇长苏玉田站起来说：“先斗争俺老丈人吧！”武委会主任王清发说：“先斗争俺叔吧！”大家说：“对，俺们就是准备斗他俩！”会场的空气又活泼起来了，酝酿结果，确定斗七个地主恶霸特务。第二天早起，便在一条大街上摆了八个场子，贫雇农民自己主持会场，男人斗争地主家男人，妇女斗争地主家妇女。
    白天斗争地主，晚上在冬学凑情况，分析酝酿，奖励新的积极分子、检查还有那些老实人。因为在斗争中，大家一致认识到：最有力量的是老实人起来说老实话，最能登展地主，提出：“一层层的发动落后，一批批的斗争地主，随发动随斗争，一个发动十个，十个发动百个，不留一个落后人，彻底登展地主！”于是谷文聚回去打通他老婆的思想说：“你说我斗地主斗的狠，你就不想想，你爹住汉们（长工）挨过地主多少打骂？！”他老婆一下想开了，自动上冬学参加诉苦斗争。彭喜回去开了个家庭会说：“咱家一年挪三个地点是怎回事？咱死受活受得来的东西都上那里去了？”提高了全家觉悟。二街一家十四口人，还有九个妇女落后，他家男人和妇女农会员便比赛着发动，最后都发动起来了，她们起来以后，又去发动别的落后妇女。后来四条街冬学，每天晚上都贯满了，每个冬学都由几十个人增加到四五百人不等。
  团拢自觉细说耐听  小意见是正经痛苦
    由于贫雇老实农民受过去的压迫太大，长期忍声受气的生活，使他怕抛头露面怕讲话，因此领导上，除了启发干部老积极分子的“团拢自觉”，懂得“小意见是正经痛苦”、“细说耐听”等道理，不去伤害他们的自尊心外，还得及时的评奖各种模范，从思想上一点一点地去巩固他们的觉悟。自从头天斗争七个地主，有几个新积极分子（贫中农都有）自献出地主隐藏在他家的东西，受到表扬以后，接着便有卅多个老实农民，都自动献出来了。斗争一次选一次模范，运动结束的时候，全村一共选出了六百五十四名男女模范。新涌现出来的贫雇积极分子，有的被选为农会小组长，有的被选为评议员、保管员等等。贫雇农民的社会地位提高了，主力军的作用也越加显示出来了。（展潮）
