Without Complacency, Patient and Thorough

Comrade Zhang Jie Conducts Detailed Investigation to Expose Landlord's Disguised Conspiracy

[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 4th] After the removal of the bad cadres in Huayangling Village, Xiangyuan, the masses have achieved genuine liberation. This village, known as a model during last year's movement, underwent a detailed inspection after the Lunar New Year, revealing that landlord Li Zhanxian was still serving as the public security director, and political director Li Shuanglin was also a landlord's running dog. As soon as they were liberated in the autumn of the year before last, they seized the opportunity to pretend to be active and usurp village leadership. Every struggle was manipulated by them. They classified themselves as poor peasants and received particularly generous shares during fruit distribution. When the masses were dissatisfied, they threatened, "You try to classify me! Who dares to say I'm not a poor peasant?" The masses were afraid and swallowed their anger. When the masses were settling accounts with landlord Deng Genqiu, Li Shuanglin scolded the masses at the meeting, saying, "You're creating chaos! Who told you to struggle against 'middle peasants'? You'll be responsible if problems arise!" Frightened, the masses dared not move. Li Zhanxian's uncle, a feudal rich peasant, had also joined the peasant association. When the masses wanted to cut off his "tail," Li Zhanxian scolded, "You're rebelling! Even members of the peasant association are being struggled against?" He often suppressed activists. For example, deputy village chief Li Liujin, a poor peasant, was often publicly humiliated by them: "Look at you! How can you serve the masses?" When peasant association chairman Wang Bingtian offered some suggestions, Li Zhanxian said, "The public security director is under the leadership of the county government. I examine village cadres for political problems. Be careful!" The cadres were too frightened to offer further suggestions. During fruit distribution, they advocated using a paper balloting method. When poor peasants Wang Xiaohu and Duan Baolao asked for some shares, Li Zhanxian said angrily, "Just you? Cadres have their own ways." As a result, they got nothing. Every time there was a meeting in the district, their reports were very impressive, and they used various methods to deceive the higher-level cadres when they came. This problem had not been exposed for more than a year. In the Lunar New Year, district cadre Zhang Jie came to the village and was surprised to see the masses were lifeless. He immediately conducted a detailed investigation. Through individual visits and group discussions, the village's problems were fully revealed. The masses said, "Now that we've told you, you must be responsible for solving it. Otherwise, we'll suffer after you leave." Comrade Zhang said, "Be bold and do it! I'll be responsible for everything." The masses first conducted class division and purged the peasant association, removing the two bad elements, Li Zhanxian and Li Shuanglin. They then dismissed them from their cadre positions and elected peasant leader Wang Jincai as village chief and political director. Other cadres were also appointed by poor peasants. The masses' enthusiasm immediately surged, and within six or seven days, the landlords of the entire village were thoroughly settled, including Li Zhanxian. The "tail" of the feudal rich peasant was also quickly cut off. After democratic discussion, the fruit was quickly distributed, and the masses happily said, "Now we are truly liberated!"

　　毫不自满耐心深入
    张杰同志细致调查拆穿地主伪装阴谋
    【本报太行四日电】襄垣化岩岭村，撤除坏干部后。群众获得真正翻身。该村去年运动中，素称模范，经旧历正月细致检查，发现地主李占先还当公安主任；政治主任李双林亦是地主的走狗。他俩在前年秋刚解放时，即投机取巧，假装积极，窃取村领导地位，每次斗争均由他们操纵，他们把自己都划成贫农，分果实时，均特别优厚，群众不满，他们还威吓说：“你们给我划划阶级，谁敢说我不是贫农”，群众害怕，遂忍气吞声。群众清算地主邓根秋时，李双林在大会上大骂群众说：“乱干一起，谁叫你们斗‘中农’，出了问题你们负责”，吓的群众不敢动了。李占先的叔父是封建富农，也入了农会，群众要割他的尾巴，李占先即大骂说：“你们造反呀，农会会员也要斗”；对于积极分子却常打击，如副村长李六金，是个贫农，他俩经常当众辱骂：“看你那个样吧，还能替群众办事”，农会主席王丙田给他们提了些意见李占先即说：“公安主任是受县政府领导的，村干部有政治问题，都由我考查，你小心点”，吓的干部们再不敢提意见。分果实，他们主张用捏纸弹办法，贫农王小虎、段保劳要求分些东西，李占先怒气冲冲的说：“光由你们呀！干部自有办法”。结果什么也没分上。每逢区上开会，他俩报告的十分漂亮，上级干部一来即用各种办法欺骗。这问题一年多，始终没有暴露，旧历正月，区干部张杰到该村，见群众死气沉沉，大为诧异，遂即进行细致调查，经个别访问、小组座谈，将该村问题完全发现，群众说：“我们既给你谈了，你就得负责解决，不然。你走了，我们可要吃亏”。张同志说：“大胆的干吧，一切由我负责”。群众首先进行阶级划分，清洗农会，把李占先、李双林两个坏蛋，均清洗出去。接着即罢免他俩干部职务，选举农民领袖王进才当村长兼政治主任，其他干部也均由贫农担任，群众劲头即起来，六、七天内，即将全村地主彻底清算，李占先亦其中之一，封建富农的尾巴也迅速割掉，果实经过民主讨论，很快分配了，群众都喜洋洋的说：“这才真真翻了身啦”。
