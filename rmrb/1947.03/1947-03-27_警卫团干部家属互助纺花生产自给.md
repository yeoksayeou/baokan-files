    【This Newspaper's Report】Five cadre families from the Guard Regiment participated in the meritorious service campaign to solve their own livelihood problems. The directly subordinate units of the regiment convened a meeting of relevant cadres and determined the following solutions:
    (1) Inspire family members to produce for self-sufficiency, overcome the "Madam" mentality, and perform meritorious service for the people. (2) Voluntarily form mutual aid groups and contact the local cooperative to solve the difficulties of buying and selling cotton and obtaining funds; those with public contribution tasks can formulate production plans, borrow temporarily from the public, and return them within a limited time. (3) In order to improve skills and exchange experiences in a timely manner, some female comrades are specially assigned to help educate, and to regularly understand their production situation. (4) Those who not only achieve self-sufficiency in production but also have surplus contributions to the public will be credited with one merit.
    As a result, their enthusiasm for production is very high. Liu Shuqin said: "I can work, and I don't rely on men or trouble the superiors for anything. I have now spun six *jin* of cotton according to the old scale, and I can earn 6,000 yuan. I can spin seven *jin* per month according to the old scale, which is enough to maintain my life with a surplus."

    警卫团干部家属互助纺花生产自给
    【本报讯】警卫团五户干部家属，参加立功运动，解决自己的生活问题。该团直属单位召开有关干部会议，确定下列解决办法：
    （一）启发家属生产自给，克服太太思想，为人民立功。（二）自愿结合互助与驻地合作社联系，解决买卖纺花及资金困难；有缴公任务者，可订生产计划由公家暂借，并限期交还。（三）为了提高技术，及时交流经验，特派一些女同志帮助教育，经常了解她们的生产情况。（四）除生产自给，又有富余缴公者记一功。
    这样一来他们生产情绪很高，刘树琴说：“我能劳动，一切都不依靠男人和麻烦上级。我现在已纺了老秤六斤花，可赚洋六千元，我每月能纺老秤七斤，足够维持生活而有余。”
