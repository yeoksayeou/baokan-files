　　On the Performance of Yangko Opera

　　The expressive techniques of Yangko opera can be basically divided into two types: symbolic and realistic.

　　Based on the form of Yangko, the movements of the characters in the play should pay special attention to dance-like qualities. However, these movements must be determined according to the identity and personality of the characters in the play (including the size of the movements, the steps of the dance, the posture, the creation of the external form, and the expression of the inner personality, etc.), and should be mainly large movements accompanied by music. Only in this way can the empty space be enlivened. Deliberately trying to please the audience by making some trivial or funny movements will destroy the atmosphere and effect of the plot.

　　The second characteristic of Yangko opera performance is the rhythmic nature of the movements. Regarding this point, we should critically learn from the strengths of the old artists, learning how they artistically transform the characters' movements and language into the rules of song and dance, learning how they closely combine music (mainly instruments) and movements, and learning how their movements are dignified and forceful. (These are all reflected in the fact that they do not move their hands and feet randomly in every lyric, but rather use extremely vivid movements in the most expressive places to powerfully reflect it to the audience. At the same time, when they move, they don't just flash in front of you and be done with it, but rather pause in front of the audience for a moment, leaving that wisp of emotion for the audience to contemplate. This gives people an extremely deep impression.) Of course, it is even more important to learn from real life, to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to understand their thoughts, feelings, and lifestyles. Only in this way can we enrich our performing arts and perfectly express their lives. Regarding this, I offer three points for reference: (especially for intellectual actors)

　　1. Strengthen the concept of labor: Labor is one of the important foundations of creation. Participate in labor, and in the life of labor, truly experience the feelings of the working people and cultivate our labor consciousness. I remember two actors performing the scene of ordinary people breaking roads and carrying railway tracks. A railway track that ten people could not lift, they easily lifted and carried while walking and singing on stage, causing the audience to laugh. Because they lacked the experience of labor and lacked real feelings and solid movements.

　　2. Strengthen our physique: We must gradually remove some of the gentle gestures of intellectuals and find healthy and beautiful labor gestures. We must first strengthen our physique. Only with a healthy body can we express a happy mood and vigorous and abundant vitality.

　　3. Often ponder and experience the life postures of the workers and peasants, and record them in our diaries at any time. Let the images of those laborers flash in our minds at all times, as a mirror for creating movements and dance steps.

　　In Yangko, singing is also an important part of the performance. Almost most of the emotions are conveyed through singing. And how to use singing to express emotions is a troubling question. Some people feel that singing will lose "realism" and feel awkward, always feeling that it is easier to grasp emotions with words and movements. This is influenced by some foreign dogmas of spoken drama, which absolutize "realism." This view is incorrect. For example, the singing in old operas is mostly welcomed by the common people, but the audience does not feel it is unreal. On the contrary, it often moves people. Singing is just an artistic form of expression, an exaggerated expression of emotion, and a beautification of language. The so-called reality is mainly to truthfully express the thoughts and feelings of the characters in the play. This is a creation, not a simple imitation of life.

　　Here are two points: First, the pronunciation must be true and clear. Squares and earthen stages do not gather sound, so we must learn the folk method of vocalization, use the power of the dan tian, amplify the sound, and sing the words truly, sending every word into the ears of the audience. Second, we must determine the characteristics of the singing based on the character and mood of a certain character. In addition, it is also important to strengthen the study of folk songs, understand folk customs, be familiar with local languages, and sing the lyrics with more folk flavor and local color.

　　Speaking of the symbolic performance techniques of Yangko opera, it is to use gestures and movements to make the audience feel the weight, size, shape, and danger of objects (such as crossing a single-plank bridge), etc. In other words, it is to lead the audience into the realm you specify, into the same field of feeling as yourself. For example, the action of opening a door must not be the same for everyone, just casually flicking it with both hands! We must study what kind of door it is, what kind of person with what kind of personality is opening it? These are all things that actors must study carefully before they can perform them. Therefore, the movements performed using symbolic techniques must make the audience feel real and have personality. It cannot be achieved by being frivolous and random, or "picking it up casually."

### 论秧歌剧的表演

　　论秧歌剧的表演
    秧歌剧的表现手法基本上可以分为象征的和现实的两种。
    根据秧歌的形式，剧中人物的动作应特别注意到舞蹈性，但这种动作必需是根据剧中人的身份性格来决定，（包括动作的大小舞步的姿态，外形的创造和内心的性格的表现…等）而且以带有音乐伴奏的大动作为主，这样才能把那空旷的场子活跃起来，故意讨好观众，作出些琐碎或滑稽的动作，是会破坏剧情的气氛和效果的。
    秧歌剧表演的第二个特点是动作的节拍性，关于这一点，我们应该好好的批判地向旧艺人学习他们的长处，学习他们如何把人物的动作和言语艺术化成歌舞的规律，学习他们如何把音乐（主要是乐器）和动作密切相结合的规律，学习他们的动作庄重有力。（这些都表现在他们并不在每个唱辞中都手脚乱动，而是在最足表现的地方用极形象的动作把它很有力的反映给观众，同时动作起来，也不是在你面前一幌就算完啦，而是在观众面前停留片刻，把那一缕情感留给观众一个思索的时间，这样给人的印象是极深刻的。）当然，更重要的还是向现实生活学习，向工农兵学习，了解他们的思想情感与他们的生活方式，这样才能丰富我们的表演艺术，完美的表现他们的生活。关于这，提出三点作为参考：（特别是知识分子演员）
    一、加强劳动观念：劳动是创造的重要基础之一，参加劳动，在劳动生活里面，真正去体会劳动人民的感情，锻炼我们的劳动意识。记得有两个演员表演老百姓破路抬铁轨，人家十个人都抬不动的一根铁轨，他们俩轻易地抬着铁轨，在台上边走边唱，引得台下的观众都嗤嗤发笑。因为他们没有劳动的体验，缺乏着真实的情感和踏实的动作。
    二、健全我们的体格：要把知识分子某些轻柔的姿态逐渐去掉，并去寻找其健康美的劳动姿态，必需首先健全我们的体格，有了健康的身体，才能表达出愉快的心情和蓬勃充足的生命力。
    三、经常揣摹体验工农群众的生活姿态，随时随地把它们划在自己的日记本上，让那些劳动者的形象，时时在自己脑子中闪现，作为创造动作和舞步时的借镜。
    秧歌中，歌唱也是表演的重要部分。差不多大部分的情感都是用歌唱的方法传达出来的。而如何用歌唱来表达情感，这是使人苦恼的问题，有些人感到唱起来会失掉“真实感”，并且感到蹩扭，总是觉得用言语和动作更容易把握情感一些，这是受了话剧的一些洋教条的影响，把“真实感”绝对化了，这种看法是不对的。譬如旧戏的演唱，大都为老百姓所欢迎，但观众并不感到不真实，相反的它常常能感动了人。歌唱不过是一种艺术的表现形式，一种情感上夸大的表现，语言的美化，所谓真实，主要是把剧中人的思想，情感真实的表现出来，这是一种创造，而不是单纯的生活上的模仿。
    这里提出两点：首先是吐字要真，要清楚。广场和土台子是不聚音的，因此我们必需学习民间发声的方法，运用丹田的力量，把声音放大，字句唱真，将每一个字都送进观众的耳朵里。其次，要根据一定人物的性格和情绪，来决定唱时的特点。此外，如加强民歌研究，了解民情风俗，熟悉地方语言，把歌词唱得更富有民间风味，地方色彩，也很重要。
    说到秧歌剧的象征表演手法就是用手势和动作来使观众感觉到物体的重量，大小形状，危险性（如过独木桥）……等，换言之，就是把观众引到你所指定的意境中，和自己感觉相同的领域里去。例如开门动作决不能都是千篇一律的都用两手随便拨一下就算完啦！我们必需研究是什么样的门，什么样甚么性格的人去拨？这些都是要经过演员细心研究，才能表演出来的。所以用象征手法表演出来的动作，要使观众感到真实，有个性，就不是轻率乱动，“随便拈来”所能成功的。
