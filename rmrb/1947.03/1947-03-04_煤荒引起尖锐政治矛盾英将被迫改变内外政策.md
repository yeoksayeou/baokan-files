　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 28th: (Combined London Dispatch) The complex situation triggered by the coal shortage, which has lasted for two weeks, is now increasingly developing into the core of sharp struggles between various parties in Britain. The right-wing, led by the Conservative Party and part of the Liberal Party, is taking advantage of the coal shortage to actively demand the resignation of Industrial Fuel Minister Shinwell, and even propose the formation of a coalition cabinet to force the Labour Party out of power. Economically, the methods proposed by the right-wing are: (1) import labor from abroad to solve the labor shortage crisis; (2) revise the direct tax system; (3) revise the current minimum wage system; (4) improve the management system of existing nationalized enterprises, etc. Some of them have also expressed their willingness to rely more on the United States, advocating that if the old loan is used up, another loan could be obtained from the United States. However, this proposition of relying on the United States cannot gain complete support even among British bankers and industrialists. A part of them strongly advocate getting closer to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in order to achieve self-reliance. On the other hand, the more powerful progressive forces such as the Labour Party left-wing, the British Communist Party, and trade unions, in light of the actual situation, propose: (1) reduce overseas troops to supplement domestic labor; (2) improve the living conditions of miners to enhance coal production; (3) accelerate the nationalization of state-controlled transportation; (4) improve relations with the Soviet Union, and immediately conclude mutually beneficial trade agreements with the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries in Europe to avoid the impending impact of the American economic crisis. However, the Labour Cabinet led by Attlee and Bevin has so far not expressed a clear direction. On the one hand, it demands increased production from labor, but on the other hand, it refuses to improve the lives of workers; on the one hand, it announces the reduction of some overseas troops, but on the other hand, it tries its best to recruit desperados such as the Polish Anders Army. The British government's rejection of Truman's "aid" of coal, and its expression of willingness to revise the old treaty with the Soviet Union and to form an alliance with France, certainly has the intention of distancing itself from the United States and getting closer to the Soviet Union and France, but its important purpose is still to ease the opposition at home and abroad as an expedient measure. This coal shortage has further expanded the contradictions between the Labour Party's domestic and foreign policies, forcing it to change its current policies.

　　煤荒引起尖锐政治矛盾英将被迫改变内外政策
    【新华社延安二月廿八日电】综合伦敦消息：持续两旬的煤荒，在英国内部所引起的各种复杂情况，现已日益发展为各党派间尖锐斗争的核心。以保守党及部分自由党为首的右派，利用煤荒积极活动，要工业燃料部长辛克尔辞职，甚至提出组织联合内阁，迫工党下台。在经济上，右派提出的方法是：（一）从国外输入劳动力，解决劳工不足的危机。（二）修改直接税制。（三）修改现行最低工资制。（四）改善现行国有化企业的管理制度等等。他们中间并且有人表示愿意更加依赖美国，主张如果旧的借款用光，不妨再向美国借一笔。可是这样依赖美国的主张，甚至在英国大银行家与工业家中间也不能得到完全的支持。他们中间一部分力主与苏联及东欧国家接近，以谋自力更生。另一面势力更加强大的工党左派、英共、职工会等进步力量，针对实际情况，提出：（一）减少海外驻军以补充国内劳力。（二）改善矿工生活条件以增强煤的生产。（三）加速国有化国家管制运输业。（四）改善对苏关系，立即与苏联及欧洲各新民主主义国家订立互惠贸易协定，避免即将到来的美国经济危机的袭扰。但是，以艾德礼、贝文为首的工党内阁，迄今并未表明确定的方针。一方面要求劳工增产，另一方面却拒绝改善劳工生活；一方面宣布减少若干海外驻军，另一方面却极力召募波兰安斯部队之类的亡命者。英政府谢绝杜鲁门煤炭的“援助”，并表示愿意与苏修改旧约，及与法缔盟约之举，固不无远美近苏法之意，但其重要目的，仍为缓和国内外反对的权宜之计。此次煤荒使工党内外政策之矛盾更加扩大，逼使其不得不有所改变现行政策。
