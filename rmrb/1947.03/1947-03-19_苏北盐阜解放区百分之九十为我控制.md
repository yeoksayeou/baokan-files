　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: The military and civilians in the Yancheng (Yancheng) and Funing (Funing) Liberated Area of northern Jiangsu are persisting in the struggle against the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops. To date, over ninety percent of the area remains under the control of the People's Liberation Army. From September to December of last year, Chiang Kai-shek's 74th, 67th, 44th, and 28th Divisions successively occupied Huaiyin, Huai'an, Lianshui, Yeting (Yancheng), Funing and other cities, attempting to completely eliminate the people's armed forces and fully occupy the Yancheng-Funing Liberated Area. In January of this year, during the "encirclement and suppression" in the area, more than 70 strongholds were built throughout the region. However, under the multiple blows of the New Fourth Army's soldiers and militiamen guerrillas, the Chiang Kai-shek troops were forced to shrink to the two transportation lines of the Grand Canal and the Nantong-Ganyu Highway. Currently, the number of Chiang Kai-shek's strongholds in the area has been reduced to just over 30, a decrease of more than one-third compared to the time of the "encirclement and suppression." The entire territory of the two counties of Binhai and Fudong (both newly established counties) east of the Nantong-Ganyu Highway is free of enemy presence. Among the 138 towns and cities in the area, only 27 are occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The remaining 111 towns and cities (including Chenjiagang, Dongkan, Huanglin, etc.) are under the administration of the democratic government. Of the 3.7 million people, only 400,000 are under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, accounting for slightly less than eleven percent. Among the 1,062 villages, only 113 are occupied by Chiang Kai-shek, accounting for 10.6 percent. From the coast of the Yellow Sea in the east to the west bank of the Grand Canal, and from Majiadang in the south to the Yan River in the north, the vast rural areas are stable, except for the 310-mile-long Nantong-Ganyu Highway from Liuzhuang to Nanxin'anwei. The 400-mile coastline, including the Guan River estuary, the Yu Huang River estuary, and the Sheyang River estuary, as well as the vast salt fields and cotton reclamation areas, are protected by the New Fourth Army's coastal defense forces and are producing as usual. Ships travel freely between the estuaries.
　　After Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied the two Huai areas in September last year, the guerrillas began fighting on both sides of the Grand Canal. The military and civilians in Huai'an and Baoying counties, between the Grand Canal and Hongze Lake, have been fighting Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the crisscrossing water networks for the past six months, directly threatening both sides of the two Huai areas and the Nantong-Ganyu Highway. A mass guerrilla war movement to kill the enemy and achieve meritorious service is being launched everywhere. Li Deyao, a model militiaman from Fudong County, killed two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and then set a plan to kill six enemies before transplanting rice seedlings. The militia of the × District of Sheyang (new county) County, west of Chuanfang River, fought 110 battles in the 40 days of Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of the area, killing and capturing 74 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and "home-returning corps" members. The Huai'an militia guerrilla team fought 146 battles in 21 days of counter-"encirclement and suppression," killing and capturing 675 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and "home-returning corps" members. In the past three months, the Yancheng-Funing soldiers团fought 40 battles, killing and capturing 1,014 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers (excluding "home-returning corps" members), seizing 18 light and heavy machine guns, 30 grenade launchers, and 375 rifles and horses. According to incomplete statistics, the militia guerrilla teams throughout the region fought 1,416 battles, killing and capturing 504 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and "home-returning corps" members, seizing 4 machine guns, over 100 rifles, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 9th: The vast salt fields between Chenjiagang, Guan River, and Sheyang River in northern Jiangsu are still stable and normal under the protection of the New Fourth Army Yancheng-Funing soldiers' salt guards. The 4,000-plus troops of Xu Jitai, a puppet officer of Chiang Kai-shek in Guanyun, have repeatedly invaded, but have been repelled by the people's armed forces. On January 15, two Chiang Kai-shek warships invaded the Guan River, attempting to occupy Chenjiagang and Xiangshui, important towns in the salt fields, but were also bravely repelled by the New Fourth Army's soldiers. The salt-producing area south of the Guan River is part of the famous Huaibei Salt Field in the country. It was liberated by the New Fourth Army before the Japanese surrendered. In recent years, the lives of salt farmers have been greatly improved, and production has also increased. Therefore, when Chiang Kai-shek's troops approached, the salt farmers organized self-defense teams to assist the soldiers in defending the salt area.

　　苏北盐阜解放区百分之九十为我控制
    【新华社华中十六日电】华中苏北盐（城）阜（宁）解放区军民坚持蒋军侵占区斗争，迄目前止百分之九十以上地区仍在人民解放军控制中。去年九月至十二月蒋军七十四、六十七、四十四、二十八等师先后侵占淮阴、淮安、涟水、叶挺（盐城）、阜宁等城，企图将人民武装完全消灭，全面占领盐阜解放区。今年一月间，向该区“清剿”时曾在全区筑下七十余据点，但在新四军子弟兵与民兵游击队多处打击下，蒋军被迫缩至运河及南（通）赣（榆）公路两交通线上。现全区蒋军据点已减至三十余个，较“清剿”时减少三分之一以上。南（通）赣（榆）公路以东滨海、阜东（均新设县）二县全境无敌踪。全区一三八个城镇中为蒋军侵占者仅二十七个，其余一百十一个市镇（包括陈家港、东坎、篁林等）均在民主政府治理下，三百七十万人口中，在蒋军统治下的仅四十万人，占百分之十一弱。一千零六十二个乡村中，蒋占乡村仅一百一十三个，为百分之十点六，东起黄海之滨西抵运河西岸，南迄马家荡北至盐河，中间除刘庄至南新安圩三百一十里长之南（通）赣（榆）公路外，广大农村秩序安定。包括灌河口、淤黄河口、射阳河口在内之四百里海岸线及广大盐场、棉垦区，均在新四军海防部队保卫下照常生产，各河口间船舶往来自如。
    去年九月间蒋军侵占两淮后，游击队便在运河两侧打响。运河、洪泽湖间的淮安、宝应县军民，半年来一直在纵横交叉的水网中与蒋军作战，直接威胁两淮及南通赣榆公路两侧。群众性游击战杀敌立功运动到处掀起，阜东县民兵模范李德耀击毙蒋军两名后又订出插秧前杀敌六名的计划，串坊河西岸的射阳（新县）县×区民兵在蒋军侵占该地四十天中作战一百一十次，毙俘蒋军及“还乡团”七十四名，淮安民兵游击队在二十一天反“清剿”中作战一百四十六次，毙俘蒋军及“还乡团”六百七十五人。三个月来，盐阜子弟兵团作战四十次毙俘蒋军（“还乡团”未计入）一千零十四人，缴轻重机枪十八挺，掷弹筒三十个，步马枪三百七十五支。全区民兵游击队据不完全统计，作战达一千四百十六次，毙俘蒋军及“还乡团”五百零四人，缴机枪四挺，步枪百余支，子弹万余发。
    【新华社华中九日电】苏北陈家港、灌河及射阳河间广大盐场迄今仍在新四军盐阜子弟兵盐卫队之保卫下安定如常。灌云蒋伪军徐继泰部四千余人屡次进犯，均被人民武装击退。一月十五日，蒋舰两艘侵入灌河，企图占领盐场重镇陈家港及响水口，亦为新四军子弟兵英勇击退。灌河以南产盐区为全国著名的淮北盐场之一部，日寇投降前即为新四军解放，几年来盐民生活大大改善，生产量亦有增加，故蒋军逼近后盐民即纷纷组织自卫队，协助子弟兵保卫盐区。
