　　Zuoquan First District Launches a Movement to Unite with the Backward
　　Backwardness without mobilization, feudalism cannot be eradicated; peasants without unity, landlords will not die easily.
　　[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 7th] Under the principle of carrying out the unity movement and thoroughly eliminating feudalism, the first district of Zuoquan is now rectifying the relationship between cadres and the masses. On the 16th of last month, the district convened a meeting of 130 people, including village cadres, activists, and some honest peasants, to review their relationship with the masses. After discussion, the cadres clarified that the main reason for the problem was their own shortcomings of "looking down on backward peasants," which often hurt them in the movement, thus affecting unity, and most backward peasants did not rise up. For example, in Chengguan alone, there were 82 backward peasants who never spoke up (37 men and 45 women). According to district-wide statistics, the backward stratum accounts for 30 to 35 percent of all peasants. The disunity within the peasantry created loopholes for the feudal landlords. After a cadre in North Street ran into a snag with a backward peasant named Zhang Guisheng, the landlord specifically sought out Zhang Guisheng when buying silver dollars, saying, "Alas! Turning over, turning over, only the cadres can turn over. See, you made a suggestion and it was rejected by the cadres. Don't bother." The landlord also seized on the fear of "changing the sky" and said, "Whoever divides the fruit invites disaster, it is better to get less than to get more, and better not to get anything at all." In five or six days, the landlord pulled in 15 backward peasants. Cadres in South Street also said: Because we don't care about the "backward," one "backward" person developed into four "second backward" and twelve "small backward." At this point, everyone clearly concluded that "backwardness without mobilization, feudalism cannot be eradicated; peasants without unity, landlords will not die easily." The cadres realized that backward peasants are their class brothers and decided to launch a unity movement to patiently enlighten the class consciousness of the backward masses. They should also take the initiative to make self-criticism to the masses, untie the "knots," and seek unity. Some cadres were afraid of losing their prestige or being struggled against by the masses. After discussion, they also realized that "the masses can see clearly, black will be washed clean, and credit will not be erased." Finally, Wang Xiangyun of Chengguan said: "I have offended many people, and they don't come near me anymore. Those who have been pushed away have become holes for the landlords. I will definitely apologize to those I have offended, admit my mistakes, fill these holes, change my style, and unite all the peasants to thoroughly eliminate feudalism." Currently, the movement for unity between cadres and the masses is being carried out in various villages, and the landlords' remaining "air-raid shelters" are also being discovered by the peasants one after another, and the movement has further deepened.
　　[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 7th] Since the cadres of Nanzhuang Village in Wu'an changed their attitude of despising the "backward" masses and actively and patiently mobilized them, they have now promoted four new activists who have changed from "backward" to active as cadres, which has excited all the "backward" masses. The four new activists are very energetic, and within a few days, they mobilized 403 women. Also, the cadres of Sanbaishu Village actively mobilized the backward and boldly allowed the new activists to take charge. In the distribution of the fruit, they first filled the small portions of three backward households, and these three new activists became the locomotives. They not only mobilized all the backward masses, but also exposed a large account of the landlord's transformations, recovering 100 red documents, 200 mu of land, 144 houses, and blood-and-sweat accounts such as current silver. The cadres happily said: "Mobilizing and uniting the backward to work together, there is a way to do everything."

### 左权一区开展团结落后运动

　　左权一区开展团结落后运动
    落后不发动，封建挤不净；农民不齐心，地主不死心。
    【本报太行七日电】左权一区在开展团结运动、彻底消灭封建的方针下，现正进行整顿干部与群众关系。上月十六日，该区召开了全区村干部、积极份子和部分老实农民共一百三十人的会议，检讨与群众关系。经过讨论，干部明确了主要因自己存在有“看不起落后农民”的缺点，运动中常碰他们，致影响团结，大部落后农民没起来。如城关就有永不吭气的落后农民八十二人（男三十七、女四十五）。全区统计：落后层占全体农民的百分之三十至三十五。农民内部不团结，给封建地主造下了空子。北街干部在给落后农民张桂生碰了一次钉子后，地主买银元就专找张桂生说：“唉！翻身翻身，只是干部们能翻身，你看你提了个意见还叫干部碰回来，趁早不要干。”又抓住怕“变天”思想说：“谁分果实谁招祸、多得不如少得，少得不如不得。”五六天，地主就拉了十五个落后农民。南街干部也说：由于咱不管“落后”，一个“落后”就发展了四个“二落后”和十二个“小落后”。至此，大家才清清亮亮的得出结论是：“落后不发动，封建挤不净；农民不齐心，地主不死心”。干部认识了落后农民是自己的阶级兄弟、决定开展团结运动，耐心启发落后群众阶级觉悟。并应主动向群众自我批评，解开“圪塔”求得团结。个别干部怕失威信或被群众斗争，经讨论后，也认识到“群众看得清，有黑要洗，有功也不抹煞。”最后，城关王相云说：“我碰了许多群众都不挨近我了，碰走的人都成了地主的窟窿，我回去一定向碰了的人赔情认不对，填住这些窟窿，转变作风；把全体农民团结起来，彻底消灭封建。”现干群团结运动已在各村开展中，地主之残余“防空洞”亦纷纷被农民发现，运动已进一步深入。
    【本报太行七日电】武安南庄村干部自转变了轻视“落后”群众态度，积极耐心发动，现又提拔四个由“落后”变为积极的新积极分子当干部，兴奋了全部“落后”群众。四个新积极分子很起劲，数天内就发动了四百零三个妇女。又三柏树村干部积极发动落后，又大胆让新积极分子起来当家干。分果实中首先填小了三户落后群众，这三个新积极分子就成了火车头。不但发动了全部落后群众，并向地主斗出变大账一本，收回红文书一百张，土地二百亩，房子一百四十四间，这有包袱现洋等血汗账。干部高兴的说：“发动团结落后一道干，作啥也有办法。”
