　　The More Thorough the Land Reform, the More Powerful the Guerrilla Warfare
    Jilu Yu Daily on Jiaxiang Mass Movement
    [This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 10th dispatch] The Jilu Yu Daily recently published a short commentary on the combination of land reform and guerrilla warfare in Jiaxiang, stating: The surge in morale among the masses and cadres in Jiaxiang after the land reform, and their confidence and determination to persist in guerrilla warfare, give us the following important insights: First, a clear understanding of the relationship between land reform and persisting in guerrilla warfare. When Jiaxiang was recovered, the county leadership immediately launched the anti-traitor and revenge movement in accordance with the urgent demands of the masses, enabling the masses to redress grievances and take revenge; and recover the looted grain and land, carrying out the land-returning-to-home movement. Therefore, the masses have the strength and determination to defend their fruits. Experience has proven that the more thoroughly land reform is carried out, the higher the farmers' enthusiasm for protecting the land, resisting Chiang, and defending themselves, and the more widely and powerfully guerrilla warfare can be carried out. If the leadership is good at raising the farmers' demands for protecting the land and resisting Chiang, it will definitely be able to closely combine the vigorous land-returning-to-home movement with the struggle against the enemy, achieving victory in guerrilla warfare and protecting the fruits of liberation. Second, although the masses are worried about the enemy's arrival, what they fear most is having no food to eat. Therefore, the masses said: "Our village fears nothing, but starvation." Therefore, regardless of the enemy planes circling at low altitude and the shelling of artillery, even on the eve of Jiaxiang's occupation by the enemy, the masses were still enthusiastically distributing grain and land. This shows the urgency of the masses' demand for grain and land distribution and the possibility and absolute necessity of resolutely implementing land reform before the enemy arrives. Third, before the enemy arrives, our firm determination to safeguard the interests of the masses and persist in guerrilla warfare has further strengthened the confidence of cadres and the masses in victory and the courage to fight. The masses rose up, making the landlords bow their heads in front of the masses, vowing not to dare to do evil. In short, due to the preliminary implementation of land reform in various places, we already have an indestructible mass base.

　　土地改革越彻底游击战争越有力
    冀鲁豫日报论嘉祥群运
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】冀鲁豫日报顷发表短论，评论嘉祥土地改革与游击战争的结合称：嘉祥土改后，群众与干部情绪的高涨和坚持游击战争的信心与决心，给我们以下几个重要启示：第一，明确认识到土地改革与坚持游击战争的关系。当嘉祥收复后，县领导机关即根据群众迫切要求，坚决开展了反奸复仇运动，使群众伸了冤，报了仇；并索回被劫夺的粮食和土地，进行了土地还家运动。因此群众就有了保卫果实的力量和决心。经验证明，那里的土地改革进行得越彻底，那里的农民保田反蒋自卫的情绪就越高，游击战争就越能广泛有力的开展。领导上如善于提高农民保田反蒋的要求，就一定可以把热火朝天的土地还家运动和对敌斗争紧密结合起来，达到游击战争的胜利，保住翻身的果实。第二，群众虽然担心敌人来，但最害怕的是没饭吃。所以群众说：“俺村啥也不怕，怕的是挨饿。”因此不顾敌机低空盘旋和大炮的轰鸣，甚至在敌占嘉祥的前夕，群众还在热闹的分粮分田。这说明了群众要求分粮分地的迫切和敌人未来前放手贯彻土地改革的可能与完全必要。第三，在敌未来前，我们坚决表示维护群众利益，坚持游击战争的决心，就更加坚定了干部与群众胜利信心与斗争的勇气，群众起来使地主在群众面前低头，发誓不敢为非作歹。总之，由于各地初步贯彻了土地改革，我们已具有不能摧毁的群众基础。
