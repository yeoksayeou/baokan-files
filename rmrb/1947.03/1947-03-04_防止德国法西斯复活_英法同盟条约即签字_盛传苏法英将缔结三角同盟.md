　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: London dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Bevin, on the day following the House of Commons debate on foreign affairs (February 28th), reported to the House of Commons on the Anglo-French alliance treaty. He said: "Regarding the terms of the Anglo-French alliance treaty, the two countries have reached an agreement and are currently making minor amendments. The treaty is expected to be signed on March 4th in Dunkirk by the French Foreign Minister and myself." Conservative Party leader Eden warmly welcomed Bevin's statement. Bevin also mentioned this treaty during the House of Commons debate on the 27th. It is said that the various autonomous towns have been fully informed of the negotiations with the French government, and the intentions of the British government have also been communicated to the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union. A British Information Office dispatch on the 28th stated: The discussions on the Anglo-French treaty "took place during Léon Blum's visit to Britain in mid-January, and shortly thereafter, the negotiations were conducted in London by the French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, and the Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Harvey. The purpose of this alliance is to prevent any future German aggression and maintain peace and security. Together with the Franco-Soviet treaty and the Anglo-Soviet treaty—the amendments of which are currently being discussed by the British and Soviet governments—the Anglo-French treaty completes the triangular relationship of mutual guarantee among the three major European powers to prevent any recurrence of German aggression."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Agence France-Presse, Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly began debating foreign policy on February 27th. French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a speech on the following day, in which he stated regarding the Anglo-French alliance treaty: He was very pleased that the negotiations had come to a close, and the current text of the treaty has been approved by the British and French governments, "therefore, I will be able to go to Dunkirk on March 4th to sign the alliance treaty." The entire assembly responded to this statement with a standing ovation. Bidault continued: "We will pass this alliance, and every clause in the Anglo-French treaty will also be provided to our other allies." According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris on the 28th: "The new alliance treaty is a prelude to the Moscow Conference. As a supplement to the Franco-Soviet treaty, this Anglo-French alliance treaty will serve as the basis for negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union regarding the amendment of the existing Anglo-Soviet treaty to suit the current situation." Bidault told the assembly that negotiations with Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Poland are underway.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: According to a United Press dispatch from Paris on the 27th: French Prime Minister Ramadier revealed at a press conference that France, Britain, and the Soviet Union have engaged in negotiations, and it is possible that the three will soon form a solid triangular alliance.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Agence France-Presse, London dispatch, 1st: Well-informed sources believe that the Belgian government will contact the British government in order to begin a Belgian-British alliance similar to the Anglo-French treaty. It is believed that the Belgian government will first attempt to sign an agreement with the Soviet Union similar to the Franco-Soviet pact before beginning these negotiations.

    盛传苏法英将缔结三角同盟
    【新华社延安二日电】伦敦讯：英外相贝文于下院辩论外交问题之次日（二月二十八日），向下院报告英法同盟条约。他说：“关于英法同盟条约的条款，两国已获协议，现正作少数修正。该约可望于三月四日由法外长与本人在敦克尔克签字。”保守党领袖艾登对贝文的声明表示热烈欢迎。关于这一条约，贝文于二十七日下院辩论中亦曾提及。据说各自治镇对于与法政府的谈判曾始终得到充分的通报，英政府的意图亦曾告诉美苏两国政府。英新闻处二十八日电称：英法缔约的讨论，“举行于一月中莱翁勃鲁姆访英之时，不久之后即由法驻英大使马西格里与外交部次官助理哈飞爵士在伦敦谈判，此盟约之目的在于防止今后德国的任何侵略，保持和平安全。加上法苏条约与英苏条约——该约的修正事宜，现正由英苏政府讨论中——，英法条约完成了欧洲三强国的互相保证的三角关系，以防止德国侵略之任何再起。
    【新华社延安二日电】法新闻社巴黎讯：法国民议会于二月二十七日开始辩论外交政策，法外长比道尔于辩论之次日发表演说，其中关于英法同盟条约称：他对谈判之已告结束，甚感荣幸，现条约原文为英法政府所批准，“因而我能于三月四日赴敦克尔克签定同盟条约”。对此声明，议会全体议员曾报以起立欢呼。比道尔继称：“我们将通过这个同盟，而英法条约中每一条，亦将提供我们的其他盟邦”。据法国新闻社巴黎二十八日电称：“新的同盟条约为莫斯科会议的序幕，作为法苏条约之补充的此一英法同盟条约，将成为英苏关于修改现存之英苏条约而使其适合于目前情况之谈判之基础”。比氏告议会称：与比、荷及捷克、波兰的谈判正在进行中。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据合众社巴黎二十七日电：法总理拉马第在记者会上透露，法英苏三国已从事谈判，可能很快将三者组成巩固的三角同盟。
    【新华社延安二日电】法新闻社伦敦一日电：消息灵通方面相信比利时政府将与英政府接洽，以期开始类似英法条约的比英同盟。据信比政府在开始这一谈判之前，将先试图与苏联签订一类似于法苏间的协定。
