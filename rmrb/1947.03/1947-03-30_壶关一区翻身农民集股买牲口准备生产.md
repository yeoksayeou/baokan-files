    Overturned Farmers in Huguan District One
    Pool Funds to Buy Livestock to Prepare for Production
    [This newspaper's Huguan dispatch] After the farmers in Huguan District One overturned [became liberated], their production enthusiasm is high. They are pooling funds to buy livestock to prepare for launching a large-scale production movement. At first, the masses in Dongguanbi were afraid that there would be too little livestock and too many corvée labor assignments, so they were not actively buying. The hero of the overturn, Huang Lai, took the lead in mobilizing four families to buy back a head of livestock. He was praised at the people's school, saying, "Corvée labor is assigned fairly based on the total labor and livestock power of the village. We can't just call on those who have livestock to do corvée labor. If you buy more livestock, the government will reward you." This influenced the whole village to pool funds to buy livestock. The village has 202 households. In the past, there were more than 60 heads of livestock. After the enemy looted and pulled them away, only four heads were left in the year before last. Now it has increased to 42 heads. The whole village is now transporting, planning to buy 70 heads of livestock before the autumn this year. Driven by Dongguanbi, in the five months from last autumn to now alone, the whole district has newly bought a total of 259 heads of livestock, including 64 mules, 7 horses, 81 donkeys, and 107 cattle. Including the original number before last autumn, there are a total of 1,020 heads. Various villages are still buying. (Ma Rulong)

    壶关一区翻身农民
    集股买牲口准备生产
    【本报壶关讯】壶关一区农民翻身后，生产情绪高涨，纷纷集股买牲口，准备开展大生产运动。东关壁群众开始怕牲口少支差多不敢积极买，翻身英雄黄来当先动员好了四家买回牲口一个，就在民校表扬说：“支差是按全村劳畜力公平支，也不能光叫有牲口的支差，多买了牲口，政府还要奖励。”这样影响全村纷纷集股买牲口，该村二百零二户，过去有牲口六十余头，经敌人抢拉到前年只留下四头，现在已增加到四十二头。现全村正在运输，计划今年秋前要买牲口七十头。在东关壁推动下，仅去秋到现在五个月，全区新买牲口计骡六十四头、马七匹、驴八十一头、牛一百零七头，共二百五十九头。连去年秋前原有数共有一千零二十头，现各村还正在购买。      （马如龙）
