　　Actively Organize the Yizhong Weaving Factory for Women's Spinning

　　The textile industry in Xingtai City was rebuilt only after liberation. At the time of liberation, there was not a single weaving factory in the whole city, let alone any spinning. After more than a year of efforts, there are now 25 weaving factories and 37 household weaving factories, with more than 700 women spinners in the city. The business and management methods of the Yizhong Weaving Factory in Mashi Street, the Fourth District, are worth promoting. In the past year, it has not only generated dividends nearly three times the capital for the masses but also actively promoted and organized the women's spinning movement in this street and other streets.

　　Almost all the weaving factories in the city still use imported thread. However, from the day it was established, the Yizhong Weaving Factory has tried its best to use the thread spun by women in the city. At first, because the women in the city did not know how to spin and did not have spinning wheels, the factory first invested in making more than 20 spinning wheels, at a cost of 200 yuan each, and distributed them in groups to women in the street who wanted to spin; it also lent them cotton, asked them to learn, and then pay back the capital after earning money. More than 20 women in this street began to spin. When they first started learning to spin, the spinning was slow and not good. The Yizhong Factory took the women's situation into consideration and did not limit the time for delivering the thread. Regardless of whether the thread was spun well or badly, it guaranteed purchase, only dividing the wages into three grades: 60 yuan, 70 yuan, and 80 yuan, etc., according to the quality of the thread. To solve the problem of where to sell these bad threads, the factory specially installed a loom for weaving waistbands. The profit earned from weaving waistbands was also not very low. As far as the factory was concerned, it did not suffer much loss.

　　Some factories deduct from wages if the amount of thread spun is not enough to cover the amount of cotton. Some even issue cotton at a low price and collect thread at a high price, causing the spinners to suffer. The Yizhong Factory, however, issues cotton and collects thread fairly. As long as they spin enough 15 taels of thread, the factory will recover it at one catty. This greatly increased the enthusiasm of the spinners. Yang Sheng, the manager of the Yizhong Factory, often personally went to various streets to conduct in-depth mobilization of women who could spin; and let the women who were already spinning thread for the factory connect with more women, and called on people everywhere at mass meetings in various streets. Therefore, a large number of spinners were united. In the beginning, there were only a dozen people, but in three or four months, it developed to 250 people.

　　When the Yizhong Factory started doing this, some people thought that this method would definitely result in a loss. However, the results of one year of operation have proven that its management methods are correct. Not only has it won the enthusiastic support of the masses in various streets (Yang Sheng was selected to participate in the Taihang Second Heroes' Conference last winter), but it has also obtained considerable profits. When the factory was first established in November of the year before last, it only had a capital of 44,100 yuan. After operating for half a year, it made a net profit of 50,000 yuan in the first settlement in April of last year, with a dividend of one times per share. In May, the capital expanded to more than 200,000 yuan; in the second settlement of the old lunar year, it made a net profit of 343,500 yuan. After starting work in the first month of this year, the capital has expanded to 489,200 yuan. Waistband machines and sock weaving machines have also been added, and the total number of employees in the factory has also increased from 10 to 15. A small settlement was made in the first month. In just over 20 days, a net profit of 280,000 yuan was made, including public accumulation funds. Now, all the factory's assets are dividends of the citizens of this street.

　　In order to carry out this year's large-scale production movement and organize more women to spin thread, the Yizhong Factory is planning to expand its capital to 3 million yuan, add four iron-wheeled machines, four hand-cranked spinning machines, and increase the number of employees to 27. If this plan is realized, it can produce at least 29 zhang of wide cloth, 12 dozen towels, 50 waistbands, and 6 dozen socks every day. The minimum net profit per day can be 30,000 yuan. More than 300 women are needed to spin thread. In the future, women in this street will not have to worry about finding a market for their spun thread, and their production and livelihood problems after their liberation can be completely solved. They said: "Our factory will only have two goals in the future: one is to be self-sufficient in spinning and not buy foreign thread; the other is to ensure that the newly liberated women in this street have work to do and food to eat."

　　积极组织妇纺的益众织工厂
    邢台市的纺织工业，是在解放以后才重新建设起来的。刚解放时，全市根本没有一家织工厂，更没纺线的。经过一年多的努力，现全市已有织工厂二十五家，家庭织工厂三十七户，纺妇七百余名。这二十五家织工厂中的四区马市街益众织工厂的营业和经营方式都有许多值得推广的地方。一年来不仅给群众谋得了将近于股本三倍的红利，更积极推动和组织了本街及外街妇女的纺花运动。
    本市的各家织工厂，差不多还都用的是外来线子。但益众织工厂，从它开始成立的那一天起，就尽量使用本市妇女所纺的线子；起初，因为城市妇女都不会纺线，没有纺车，工厂便先出资打了二十多辆纺车，按成本二百元一辆，分组发给本街要求纺花的妇女；并借给他们棉花，让他们去学习，赚钱后再还本，本街有二十多个妇女便开始纺起线来。初学纺线，纺的慢又不好，益众工厂为妇女打算，对交线时期不加限制，不管线纺的好坏，也都保证收购，只是将工资按线的好坏分为六十元、七十元、八十元等三等。工厂为解决这些坏线的出路，特安设织腰巾机一架，织成腰巾后，所赚的利润也并不很低，在工厂说来，也没受多大损失。
    有些工厂，线纺成不够棉花数，就从工资内来扣除，甚至有个别发花收线，出低入高，使纺妇们吃亏；益众工厂却发花收线公平，只要纺够十五两线子，工厂就可按一斤来收回，纺妇们积极性大大提高。益众工厂经理杨生，经常亲自到各街去找那些可以纺花的妇女进行深入动员；并让已经给工厂纺线的妇女，去串通更多的妇女，并在各街群众会上到处号召。因此团结了大批的纺妇，最初只十几个人，三四个月就发展到二百五十人。
    当益众工厂开始这样做的时候，有些人认为这样搞法，非赔本不可。但一年来经营的结果，事实证明它经营方法正确，不但获得了各街群众的热烈拥护（杨生曾被选派参加了去冬太行二届群英大会），同时，也获得相当利润。该厂前年十一月刚成立时，只有资本四万四千一百元，经营了半年，到去年四月的第一次结账，就净赚了五万，每股分红一倍。五月资本便扩大到廿万余元；旧历年的第二次结账，又净赚了三十四万三千五百元。今年正月初开工后，资本已扩大到四十八万九千二百元。又增加了腰带机、织袜机，全厂职工亦从十人增加到十五人。正月的作了一小结，只二十多天，连公积金在内又净赚了二十八万元。现该厂全部财产，都是本街市民的红利。
    为了开展今年的大生产运动，组织更多的妇女纺线。益众工厂正计划将资本扩大到三百万元，再添设铁轮机四架，手拉纺机四架，职工增加到二十七人。如这个计划实现后，每日至少能出产宽面布二十九丈，手巾十二打。腰带五十条，袜子六打，最低每天可净赚洋三万元。需要三百个以上的妇女来纺线，本街妇女今后纺线就不愁没销路，她们翻身以后的生产和生活问题都可完全解决了。她们说：“我们的这个工厂，今后只有两个目的：一个是自纺自给，不买外线；一个是保证本街的新翻身妇女有活做，有饭吃。”
