　　Niu Shue and Hanzhuang Textiles
　　——A Record of a Model Female Village Head
　　Hanzhuang Village in Huguan County, with two to three hundred households, elected a twenty-five-year-old young woman as deputy village head. She has now become one of the model cadres in the Taihang area, and her name is Niu Shue.

　　The winter before last, the government called for the development of textiles. Half of Hanzhuang Village were outsiders from Henan. The people of Henan all knew how to weave, but were unwilling to teach the local Shanxi people, saying it violated Henan's rules. Shue found Wang Pangniu, who had attended the county's labor hero meeting. She was also afraid of violating the rules, but Shue said: "Whether you are from Shanxi or Henan, the poor are all one family. You came to Shanxi, didn't you suffer oppression and lack food and clothing every year? If it hadn't been for everyone rising up to turn things over, you wouldn't be able to weave either." Pangniu was persuaded. Shue then went to Wang Xin, a village cadre from Henan, and said: "You are a cadre, if you don't mobilize your wife, how can you mobilize others?" Wang Xin's wife was also mobilized. People to teach were found, but the women said: "The cotton distributed by the cooperative has been watered. If the spun thread is short weight, who can afford to pay for it?" It turned out that the cooperative's manager was a landlord, and he was sabotaging. Shue mobilized the village to settle accounts with him. Some people said: "What's the point of settling accounts? The cooperative is jointly run by three villages. Even if we settle accounts, it's still other people's money." But Shue continued to mobilize the women, saying: "The cotton is spun by us, the flour is eaten by us, and the 'branch' -- the manager -- is making a fortune off of us." Finally, more than a hundred women rose up and calculated that the manager had embezzled more than 27,000 yuan, and everyone replaced the manager. The problem was solved, but the women were still unwilling to organize. Some said they had children to take care of, others said their families were already a group, they would just spin, what was the point of organizing? In reality, everyone was afraid that being together would lead to trouble and losing money. Shue thought she should set an example herself first, so she organized ten people to spin together. The result was that it saved labor and made money. There was no problem with that. But first, Shue's family started to make trouble. Her mother-in-law said: You eat the family's food, but you don't do the family's work. Her sisters-in-law said: You only eat ready-made food, you don't do anything yourself. Shue held a family meeting and decided that everyone would take turns cooking and divide the family's cotton, each spinning their own. The sisters-in-law were satisfied, but the mother-in-law still didn't agree, so they implemented an 20/80 profit sharing scheme, where each person spun five liang of thread per day, and earned two-tenths for themselves and eight-tenths for the family. If they exceeded five liang, the family got one-tenth and the individual got nine-tenths. There were no more problems. Unexpectedly, rumors spread in the village. Some people said: If this goes on, you can earn more than a thousand in five or six days. If you work for a year, there will be no money left to earn. If the district knows, the burden will increase. For a time, textile production stopped. Finally, the district sent an official document stating that all the money earned from handicrafts would not be subject to taxation, which finally solved the problem. Now everyone is weaving, but some are active and some are not. Shue consulted with the cooperative and made three spinning wheels and bought some towels, etc., to reward the model women selected by everyone to encourage them. From then on, Hanzhuang's textile industry boomed. It's not enough for our village to be good, the whole district has to be good. The district asked Shue to discuss opening a textile training class in Hanzhuang to promote the entire district, and Shue readily agreed. The east family borrowed machines, the west family borrowed shuttles, and a total of more than thirty women from other villages were trained. But Shue was still worried, afraid that these women would not be able to promote the textile industry in their respective villages when they returned. She mobilized the women in her village to go out and teach weaving. Some women were unwilling, but Shue said: Chairman Mao led us to turn things over, we can't forget Chairman Mao. If we teach others, they won't forget us either. She mobilized a total of twenty-six women to go out and teach more than one hundred and twenty women, and the textile industry in the entire district also developed. ... ...

　　The reporter recorded her model deeds, which interestingly illustrate how the textile movement in the Taihang area was launched. Of course, more importantly, the person who did such a thing was a woman, and she represents how the women of the entire Taihang area are shouldering the important task of building the Taihang area in the same way as men.

　　If you want to ask why Niu Shue is so enthusiastic about doing things, it's because when she was a teenager, her family was so poor that they sold her to Li Shuzheng as his wife for three hundred catties of flour. Li was also a pauper, and he got nine mu of land after the rent reduction and interest rate reduction in 1933, and from then on he was promoted to a middle peasant. That is the answer.

　　牛书娥和韩庄纺织
    ——记一个模范女村长
    壶关县二三百户的韩庄村，选了一个二十五岁的年青妇女当副村长，她现在并成为了太行区的模范干部之一，她的名字是牛书娥。
    前年冬天，政府号召发展纺织，韩庄村有一半是外来的河南人，河南人人会纺织，却不愿教本地的山西人，说是犯了河南的规矩。书娥找到了曾参加县里劳动英雄会的王胖妞，她也怕犯了规矩，书娥说：“山西人也罢，河南人也罢，穷的总是一家人。你到山西来，不也是受压迫年年没吃穿，要不是大家起来翻了身，你就会纺织也不行。”胖妞被说服了。书娥又去找村干部河南人王新说：“你是个干部，你不动员你老婆出来，怎样动员别人？”王新老婆也动员出来了。教的人有了，但是妇女们说：“到合作社领的花都上过水，纺成线缺斤秤，谁赔得起。”原来合作社经理是个地主，他在捣鬼，书娥发动村上和他算账。有些人说：“算个啥，合作社是三个村合开的，算出来还不是人家的。”书娥却继续动员着妇女，她说：“花是咱纺的，面是咱吃的，得支——经理——发的是咱们的财。”最后一百多个妇女起来算出了经理贪污二万七千多元，大家换了个经理。问题解决了，但是妇女还不愿组织起来，有的说家有孩子顾不上，有的说咱家里就算一个组，纺就纺吧，组织起来干什么？实的里是大家怕在一起闹不好，赔了钱。书娥想还是自己先作了榜样，便组织了十个人纺起来，结果是省工又赚钱、这算没问题了。可是首先书娥家里就闹开了，婆婆说：吃了家里饭，不做家里活。妯娌们说：光吃现成饭，自己不动弹。书娥在家开了个家庭会，决定大家轮流作饭，把家里的花分开，各纺各的。妯娌们满意了，但婆婆还不答应，于是又实行二八分红，每天每人纺五两线，赚下钱个人得二分，家庭得八分。超过了五两，家庭得一分，个人得九分。再没有问题了。不想村上又传开话了。有人说：这样闹起来，五六天就赚一千多，干上一年，赚钱就没的了，区上知道，负担可就该增加了。一时纺织停顿下来了。最后区上来了正式公文，说明凡是一切手工业默下的钱，都不负担，这才算解决。现在大家都纺织起来了，可是有的积极，有的就不积极。书娥和合作社商量，做了三架纺花车，买了些毛巾等，奖给大家选出来的模范妇女鼓励大家。从此韩庄的纺织轰轰烈烈闹起来。本村好了，总还得全区好才行，区上找书娥商量在韩庄开纺织训练班推动全区，书娥一口承应下来。东家借机，西家借梭，一共训练了三十多个外村妇女。但书娥还不放心，怕这些妇女回去推动不了各村，她又动员本村妇女出村去教纺织，有的妇女不愿意，书娥说：毛主席领导咱们翻了身，咱们忘不了毛主席，咱们教会了人家，人家也忘不了咱们。她一共动员了二十六个妇女出村教会了一百二十多个妇女，全区纺织也发展起来了。…………
    记者记下了她这一个模范事迹，它很有趣的说明了太行区的纺织运动是怎样开展起来的。当然更重要的是，做下这样一件事情的乃是一个妇女，她正代表着整个太行区的妇女怎样在和男人一样担负着建设太行区的重任。
    如果要问为什么牛书娥这样办事热心。她十几岁上家里穷得没法，以三百斤面的代价把她卖给了李树正为妻，李可也是个穷光蛋，三十三年减租减息得了九亩地，从此升为中农。这就是答案。
