　　Promote the Merit Campaign to the Countryside
    Today's newspaper reports that women in various counties of the Taihang Third Administrative Region are launching a merit campaign in the spring hundred-day spinning and weaving effort. In Qiushuyuan Village in Licheng County and Jiachi Village, Shixia, and other villages in Pingshun County, there is a surge of mutual challenges between individuals, groups, and villages. This is a new development in our region's merit campaign and a very good way to commemorate this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day.
    Our region's merit campaign was first launched in the army and then expanded to rear-area organizations; now it has penetrated into the masses in the countryside, which is a very good phenomenon. Facts have proven that wherever the merit campaign is launched, work there sees rapid progress. Women in villages such as Licheng and Pingshun counties are consciously competing for merit in the hundred-day spinning and weaving campaign, which will be a reliable guarantee for completing the spring spinning task. Just as with spinning and weaving, other tasks such as land reform, spring plowing, and war support can also launch merit campaigns based on the actual situation of each village to promote them. We call on comrades working in counties and districts to pay attention to this new development of the merit campaign penetrating the rural masses, and to consciously and systematically advocate, encourage, help, and organize, so that the merit campaign can be widely carried out in various places, and all kinds of work can be improved a step further.

　　把立功运动推广到乡村中去
    今日报载太行三专区各县妇女，在春季百日纺织中开展了立功运动。黎城秋树垣及平顺家池的、石匣等村，掀起个人与个人，组与组，村与村的相互挑战。这是我区立功运动的新发展，是今年纪念“三八”节很好的方法。
    我区立功运动，首先从军队发起，以后扩展到后方机关中；现在又深入到乡村群众中去了，这是很好的现象。事实证明，那里开展了立功运动，那里的工作就有飞跃进步。黎城、平顺等县各村妇女自觉的在百日纺织运动中竞赛立功，这将是完成春纺任务的可靠保证。纺织工作是这样，其他如土地改革、春耕、战勤等工作，亦可以根据各村的实际情形，发起立功运动，予以推动。我们号召各县、区工作同志，重视目前立功运动深入乡村群众这一新的发展，有意识有计划的去提倡、鼓励、帮助、组织，使立功运动在各地广泛开展，使各种工作都能提高一步。
