Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th: The Fubaihong Armed Work Team, active near Dazhongji in Tai (Dongtai) North, a famous cotton-producing area, has now become a shield for the people in the cotton reclamation area. Fubaihong was a worker who had worked in Dazhongji for fourteen years and suffered all kinds of oppression in the old society. Last year, he actively led the workers to stand up and was elected as the General Chairman and Captain of the township's cotton ginning trade union. After Dazhongji was occupied by Chiang's army, he immediately led the workers to organize an armed work team to persist in the struggle for self-defense. On December 15th last year, taking advantage of the Chiang army's troop rotation and weak forces, he entered the street and transported back more than 200 loads of the people's property that had been looted before safely transferring it. When returning to the market in the middle of the night, they were mistaken for heavenly soldiers descending. On January 25th last year, the team once forced back Chiang's army, rescuing more than 240 trapped residents. On the 29th of the same month, the team entered Zhenbing again, capturing several Chiang-organized "Self-Defense Force" members and returning after posting slogans such as "Oppose Treason" and "Cut Down [Military Spending]". In the past two months, the team has fought more than 20 battles, killing and capturing 23 Chiang soldiers and "Returning Home Corps" members. Under the team's active resistance, Chiang's army has been forced to hold onto Dazhongji, and the villages near the stronghold have never been organized into Baojia [collective responsibility system], nor have they paid Chiang's taxes.

　　台北工人武工队活跃敌后
    解救人民拒缴蒋捐
    【新华社华中四日电】活跃于著名棉产地台（东台）北大中集附近的阜百宏武装工作队，现已成为棉垦区人民的屏障。阜百宏是在大中集做过十四年工的工人，在旧社会里受尽种种压迫，去年仅积极领导工人翻身，被选为全镇轧花工会总会长兼大队长。大中集被蒋军侵占后，他即领导工人组织武工队，坚持自卫斗争；去年十二月十五日，该人乘蒋军换防兵力空虚之际，进入街中，搬运回被抢民物二百余担后；安全转移。夜半将往返回该集时，惊为天兵下降，去年一月二十五日，该队并一度逼退蒋军，救出被困居民二百四十余。同月二十九日，该队再度进入镇丙，活捉蒋记“自卫队”多名，满贴反对卖国  裁等标语而回。两月来该队曾作战二十余次，毙俘蒋军及“还乡团”二十三名。在该团积极抗击下，蒋军始终困守大中集，据点附近各乡、始终未编保甲、未缴蒋捐。
