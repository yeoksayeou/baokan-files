Our JiluYu combat troops pay great attention to the work of supporting the army and cherishing the people. Whether in marching, in the intervals between battles, or even in battles, they do everything possible to carry out the work of supporting the army and cherishing the people, so the relationship between the army and the people is very close.

	The Second Company of the Wenshang Brigade Supports the Masses in Standing Up
	The masses in Huangjiadian Village, ×× County, were unable to stand up under the rule and oppression of reactionary landlords, traitors, and special agents in the village. After the Second Company of the Wenshang Brigade was stationed in the area, it decided to use guns to support the mass movement to stand up. It sent comrades Zhou Qinghe, Li Wenyou, and others to conduct in-depth investigations and understanding of the situation, and held a "Poor Brothers Meeting," discovered activists and mass leaders, and helped them elect assessors. Then, with the support and encouragement of the revolutionary armed forces, the masses began to take action. In just a few days, they obtained the fruits of struggle: 1.5 hectares of land, 5,600 kilograms of grain, and 12,000 kilograms of firewood. The masses' fighting spirit and courage were greatly improved, and they expressed unlimited kindness and love for our army.

	Strict Discipline Praised by the Masses
	In marching, the 264th Unit specifically formed a discipline inspection brigade to carefully check the discipline of the troops. The machine gun company of the Second Battalion of the 223rd Unit paid great attention to discipline. When the discipline team went to inspect on the 22nd, the masses said, "Good." For example, during the seven days they were stationed there, not a single piece of bark was damaged by the livestock. Before the march of the supply office of the Third Eighth Unit's company, Director Liu convened a meeting of the communications, cooking, and feeding squads, proposing a discipline competition. The result was very good. When they left Yuhuangmiao, the villagers insisted on sending them off in carts. Company Commander Wang and Doctor Li of the company's reception station were particularly concerned about the carters who followed them. Every time they arrived at a place, they got food and drink for the villagers. The villagers said, "You are so good!" The Eighth Detachment of a certain unit of the 265th Unit widely publicized the propositions of our party and our army to the masses in the villages occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek's army during the southward march, and implemented the "full water tank" movement. Fan Shilin, the company commander of the 36th Unit, coordinated with the village cadres to find straw for bedding when camping in Wangzhuang, weighed it, and distributed it to each platoon. He instructed each squad, "Do not use this straw for fire. Tie up the straw tomorrow and send it back here." Before leaving the next day, he found the village cadres, explained the bedding straw, and asked them to weigh it to see how much was missing. The village cadres were so happy that they said, "It's natural to lose some after sleeping on it for a night. It doesn't matter if you lose a little." Liu Renhe of the Third Detachment always filled the landlord's water tank, no matter how tired he was, every time he arrived at a place. The Eighth Detachment extensively promoted the propositions of our Party and army to the masses in villages once occupied by Chiang Kai-shek’s troops during the southward march, and universally implemented the "Fill the Water Tank" campaign.

	Conscientiously Saving Civilian Labor and Promoting Hard Work
	The 72nd Unit originally had ×× military vehicle carts. In order to save civilian labor and reduce the burden on the people, they distributed the hand grenades pulled by the carts to everyone, from the highest leader of the unit to every handyman, and as a result, the number of carts was reduced by half. The First Company of the 74th Unit used to feel that there were various difficulties in marching, and small carts, porters, and donkeys were needed to solve them. Since the leadership checked and paid attention, there are now no donkeys, porters, or small carts in the march, and the troops are moving in the same way. Once, when departing from ××, Political Commissar Dou and Director Zhou of the company discovered a porter in plain clothes in the directly subordinate unit. They immediately went to the unit to check. After asking, they found out that he was a soldier who had just voluntarily returned to the team.

　　我冀鲁豫部队随时注意拥爱工作
    我冀鲁豫作战部队，对拥爱工作十分注意，无论在行军中，在战斗间隙中，甚至在战斗中，都尽一切可能进行拥爱工作，因而军民关系十分密切。
    汶上大队二连支持群众翻身
    ××县黄家店群众，在该村反动地主、汉奸、特务的统治压榨下，不能翻身，汶上大队二连驻该区后，决心用枪杆来支持群众翻身运动，乃派出周庆合、李文有等同志，深入调查了解情况，召开了“穷兄弟爷们会”，发现了积极分子与群众领袖，帮助他们选出了评事员。于是群众在革命武装的支持与鼓舞下，开始行动起来，只几天工夫，得到斗争果实地一顷五十亩，粮五千六百斤，柴一万二千斤，群众的斗争情绪与斗争勇气大大提高了，并对我军表示无限亲切与爱戴。
    纪律严明群众称赞
    在行军中，二六四部队专门组成纪律检查大队，仔细检查部队纪律。二二三部二大队机枪连，很讲纪律，廿二日纪律组去检查，群众都说：“好”。如他们在那里驻了七天，就没有一块树皮被牲口啃坏。三八部队中队供给处在行军前，刘处长召集了通讯、炊事、饲养三个班的会议，提出纪律比赛，结果搞的很好，当他们离开玉皇庙时，老乡硬要用车送他们。中队收容所王所长、李医生，特别关心跟随他们的大车夫，每到一地，就给老乡弄吃喝，老乡说：“您太好了！”二六五部队某部八分队，在南下行军中，普遍建立了借物证。三六部队范士林连长在王庄宿营时，协同村干部找铺草，过了秤再分给各排用，并嘱咐各班“不准用这草烤火，明天把草捆好仍旧送到这里来。”第二天出发前，找到村干部，交代铺草，还请他们过秤，看少了多少。村干部喜欢的不行，说：“铺了一夜自然要少点，少点也不要紧。”三小队刘仁和，每到一地，不管怎样疲劳，总要给房东担满缸水。八小队在蒋军占过的村庄大量向群众宣传我党我军主张，并都实行了满缸运动。
    认真节省民力发扬艰苦作风
    七二部队原有××辆军械大车，为了节省民力，减轻人民负担，他们把大车拉的手榴弹，从该部最高首长起，到每个勤杂人员都分带起来，结果减少大车一半。七四部队一中队过去行车常常觉着有种种困难，要小车、民夫、毛驴等才能解决，自从领导上检查注意后，现在行军没有一个毛驴、民夫或小车，部队一样的行动。一次从××出发时，该中队窦政委、周主任发现直属队有一个穿便衣的挑夫，立即到该单位检查，一问，原来是才自动归队的战士。
