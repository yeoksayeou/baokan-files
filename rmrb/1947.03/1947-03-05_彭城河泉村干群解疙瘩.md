　　Pengcheng Hequancun Cadres and Masses Resolve Conflicts
    [Report from this newspaper] Cadres and masses in Hequancun, Pengcheng, resolved conflicts and improved cadre-mass relations. The masses in the village were dissatisfied with the cadres' embezzlement of fruits, and some said: "Anyway, we've got blood on our hands from killing, and all the good stuff is taken by the cadres." Some cadres also complained. Zhao Zhifu said, "Some cadres are embezzling things, making us look bad too. I'm really discouraged!" After the leadership found out, they first held a cadre meeting, proposing "We are one family, let's not speak like outsiders." Xie Gengchun said, "I am the most at fault. I took seven pieces of clothing, two pieces of cloth, wore a woolen sweater, and a woolen scarf. This matter is my heart disease, and I hope everyone will come and cure me." Under his influence, cadres Shan Yougui, Li Jin, and others also made self-criticisms. The next day, these cadres admitted their mistakes and returned the items at a mass meeting. The masses also raised many opinions to help the cadres clear their names. Ren Decai said, "This meeting to resolve conflicts is great! Everyone, think about how every town chief used to be corrupt? Who dared to say anything back then!" Finally, everyone proposed: "In the future, if we have any opinions, we will raise them at the meeting, not talk behind people's backs, so that the special agents have no opportunity to exploit."

　　彭城河泉村干群解疙瘩
    【本报讯】彭城河泉村干部群众解疙瘩，改善干群关系。该村群众对干部贪污果实不满，有人说：“反正咱杀人落了两手血，好东西都叫干部要了。”有些干部也发牢骚，赵支伏说：“干部里有人贪污东西，叫俺跟着落不是，俺实在灰心！”领导上发觉后，首先召开干部会，提出“一家人不说两家话”，谢更春说：“错是数我错大，我拿了七件衣服，两块布，穿了一身毛衣，一条毛围巾，这件事是我的心病，希望大家都来给我治病。”在他的影响下，干部单有贵、李金等也都纷纷作了检讨。第二天这些干部在群众大会上承认错误，退出东西，群众也提了许多意见，帮助干部擦黑。任得才说：“咱这个解疙瘩会就好着哩！大家想想以前那个当镇长不贪污？那时谁敢吭！”最后大家提出：“今后有意见就在会上提，不背后说，叫特务无机可乘。”
