Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd. After the liberation of Zhangdian, citizens, supporting the old and leading the young, tightly surrounded the democratic government workers, saying in unison: "The reactionaries are too bad, they knew you would come back sooner or later!" Of the original thirty-five large stores in Zhangdian, only twenty-five were barely surviving after seven or eight months of occupation by the Chiang army. Had the People's Liberation Army arrived any later, the merchants would have had to hand over 60,000 jin of wheat that the Chiang army was currently demanding. When the public notice of reassurance was posted, the masses scrambled to read it, and many people reported weapons hidden by the Chiang army to the democratic government, handing over twenty guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in two hours. An old man from a certain village traveled a long distance to report a warehouse of the Chiang army in a certain location. The democratic government is now actively carrying out consolidation work.
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 2nd] When the news of the victory on the northern front of Lu (Shandong) reached this area, all the soldiers and civilians in the region were overjoyed. After the extra edition was published, the sound of gongs and drums resounded everywhere. The villages near the residence of the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily are undergoing land reform, which made them even more enthusiastic and excited. Zhu Qingxiang, a member of the Zhu Lou farmers' association, said: "The people's army is fighting old Chiang, and we farmers are digging up Chiang's roots!" Cadres of the San Guan Miao village read the news of the victory to the farmers, and everyone jumped up with excitement after hearing it. Old lady Qiu said, "That's how you deal with old Chiang!" When the Yue Zhuang stretcher team was preparing to depart for the front line, they heard the news of this victory, and everyone became even more energetic in equipping the stretchers. Liu Lao Jian said, "We must take good care of the wounded." Zhang Wujin, a soldier of a certain unit, said: "We must also fight such a beautiful battle!"

　　张店市民热烈欢迎我军
    民主政府积极进行安抚工作
    【新华社山东三日电】张店解放后，市民扶老携幼把民主政府工作人员紧紧围成一团，异口同声地说：“反动派太坏了，知道你们迟早会回来的！”张店原有三十五家大商店，在蒋军侵占七八个月后，仅余二十五家勉强支撑，人民解放军倘使晚来一步，商家又要缴出蒋军正在催索中之小麦六万斤。当安民布告贴出后，群众争相阅读，许多人把所知蒋军藏下的武器报交民主政府，两小时即交出二十支枪，子弹数百发。某村一老百姓远道赶来，报告某处有蒋军仓库一所。现民主政府正积极进行安抚工作。
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】鲁南北线胜利消息传到此地，全区军民莫不欢欣鼓舞。号外刊出后，各地锣鼓欢腾之声共起。冀鲁豫日报驻地附近村庄正进行土地改革，更热烈兴奋。朱楼农会员朱庆祥说：“人民军队打老蒋，咱们农民刨蒋根！”三官庙村干部把胜利的战报念给农民听，大家听后都兴奋的跳起来。邱老太太说：“就是这样治老蒋才行！”岳庄担架队正准备出发前线时听到这胜利消息，大家更起劲的装备担架床。刘老渐说：“可是要好好的保护伤员。”某部战士张武进说：“我们也要打这样的漂亮仗！”
