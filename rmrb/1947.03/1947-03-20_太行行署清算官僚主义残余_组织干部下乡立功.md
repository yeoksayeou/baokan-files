(Our newspaper Taihang, 18th dispatch) In response to the Border Region Government's call to launch a campaign to earn merit, the Taihang Administrative Office conducted a month-long major inspection campaign of its agencies from February 2nd to March 1st, to clear away the remaining bureaucratic practices in its work. Under the leadership of Director Li Yiqing, all cadres, with a serious attitude of being responsible to the people of the entire region, criticized some cadres for neglecting the leadership of mass movements and not doing enough to support and make decisions for the masses; in terms of finance, they still held a purely revenue-collection viewpoint and had not learned the mass line of "developing production and building finance"; the already existing creative experiences in local financial work, obstructed by the remnants of bureaucracy, had not been summarized and promoted; there was a lack of ideological and political leadership towards the lower levels, and leadership did not come from the masses and go to the masses, but came from the mind and went to paper, among other unthorough practices. They also conducted ideological self-examination and re-clarified the concept of the masses and the mass line. During the summary and inspection campaign, Director Li pointed out: To earn merit for the people, one must have the "orderly servant" thinking of wholeheartedly serving the people, deeply understand what the masses need and oppose, and have a loyal attitude towards work, the mass line, and a democratic style. This clearing away of bureaucracy has laid the foundation for the merit-earning campaign. After the summary, they formulated standards for earning merit: 1. Those who lead a department or organization to significant achievements; 2. Those whose work performance exceeds the general level; 3. Those who have new creations that promote work; 4. Those who overcome difficulties to complete tasks; 5. Those who respond to the call to promote others or actively contribute to construction. Director Li called for mutual assistance in earning merit rather than competing for credit. To this end, the Administrative Office decided that most of its cadres would go to the countryside this year, and compiled and printed two volumes of a spring work manual. The first batch of thirty people, divided into six work groups, departed on the 8th. Before leaving, Director Li specifically instructed: Listen to the opinions of the masses, learn from practice, and lead the entire region to launch a vigorous production movement and a vigorous movement to support the war.

　　太行行署清算官僚主义残余
    组织干部下乡立功
    【本报太行十八日电】响应边府号召，开展立功运动，太行行署特自上月二日至本月一日进行了一月机关大检查运动，清算工作中残存的官僚主义。在李主任一清的领导下，全体干部以对全区人民负责的严肃态度，批判了部分干部忽视群运领导，对群众撑腰作主不够；财政上仍有单纯征收观点，而未学会“发展生产建设财政”的群众路线，各地财政工作中已有的创造经验，官僚主义残余的障碍亦未能予以总结发扬；对下缺乏思想领导与政治领导，领导不是从群众中来到群众中去而是从脑子里来到纸面上去等不深入的作风。并作了思想检查，重新明确了群众观念与群众路线。在总结检查运动时李主任指出：要为民立功，必须有全心全意为人民的“勤务员”思想，深入了解群众需要什么反对什么，和对工作的忠诚态度，群众路线与民主作风，此次清算了官僚主义即为立功运动打下了基础。总结后他们订出了立功标准：一、领导一部门一组织有显著成绩者；二、工作成绩超过一般水平者；三、有新创造因而推动工作者；四、克服困难完成任务者；五、响应号召推动别人或积极建设议有贡献者。李主任号召互相帮助立功而不要争功。为此行署决定今年大部干部下乡，并编印了春季工作手册两册。首批下乡者三十人分六个工作组，已于八日出发。离署前李主任特叮咛：倾听群众意见，向实际学习，领导全区开展热烈的大生产运动和热烈的支援战争运动。
