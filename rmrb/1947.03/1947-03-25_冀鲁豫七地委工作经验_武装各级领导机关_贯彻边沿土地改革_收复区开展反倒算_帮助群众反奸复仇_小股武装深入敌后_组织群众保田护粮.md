[This newspaper dispatch from Jiluyu, dated the 22nd, reports on] the experience of the Seventh Prefectural Committee of Jiluyu in fighting the enemy in three types of areas: (1) Border areas: In the past, the entire region's armed forces were concentrated, waiting for developments, which led to the stagnation of village-level work, unrest among the masses, and opportunistic activities by bad landlords. 1. District cadres should quickly disperse their armed forces to operate in small units, transforming peacetime organizations into wartime organizations, using the armed organizational form to lead the villages, continuing to deepen war preparations, distributing land and grain, and implementing land reform. 2. Conduct war mobilization among the masses, proposing slogans such as "Protect your lifeblood (land), protect your livelihood (grain)," and "Hold a gun in one hand and distribute land in the other." (2) Recovered areas: Due to the landlord counterattacks and the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, the broad masses suffered losses and harbored flames of anger against Chiang Kai-shek and desires for revenge. 1. Before the enemy retreats, try to understand the situation in the villages. As soon as the enemy leaves the villages, we should enter immediately, conduct propaganda based on the specific situation, offer condolences and compensation to the victims, and launch revenge and settlement based on the opinions of the masses, returning grain for grain taken and land for land taken, and demanding life for life. The government should greatly support the masses to suppress evil and inspire the masses' courage to fight. 2. In carrying out post-war work, conduct in-depth education and mobilization, and punish the rebellious elements according to the severity of their offenses, while appropriately rewarding landlords who perform well. 3. The government should post notices to quickly restore democratic order, stabilize the emotions of the masses, and further strengthen war preparations to prevent the enemy from invading again. (3) Enemy-occupied areas: Local bullies and landlords flaunt their power, and the basic masses are subjected to brutal oppression, eagerly awaiting our rescue, while all classes, in light of the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, also lean towards us. 1. Cadres should combine armed forces and flexibly use dispersed or concentrated forms, inserting and withdrawing as appropriate, operating in the enemy's heartland. 2. Timely use armed force and administrative power (such as issuing notices and proclamations, and issuing hand-written orders) to crack down on and suppress local bullies and landlords, intensify propaganda and mobilization, so that the masses can carry out conscious struggles to protect land and grain, and issue warnings to landlords: "Whoever colludes with secret agents or the Home Return Corps will find their own way to the Yellow Springs (death)," and "Law-abiding good landlords will be cared for by the members." Tell the masses "Protect the land you have been allocated and you will have no trouble eating steamed buns when the wheat is harvested; protect the grain you have been allocated and you will not suffer from hunger in the spring." 3. Closely combine open armed struggle with secret, persistent struggle. 4. Seize favorable opportunities to attack the Home Return Corps, capture armed secret agents, distribute leaflets, disintegrate the enemy army, and carry out planned explosions, sabotages, and harassments... and launch a wide range of guerrilla warfare.
