    Jincheng Gongnong Restaurant Warmly Welcomes Civilian Laborers
    [Our dispatch] The Jincheng Xiaodongguan Gongnong Restaurant has been commended by the Taihang Fourth Special District for its meritorious service in assisting war support work. The Gongnong Restaurant had only recently opened. When civilian laborers from Lingchuan came to stay at the restaurant while transporting grain, the staff enthusiastically provided bowls and chopsticks for their use. The restaurant originally used coal for heating, but fearing the laborers would suffer from the cold weather, they switched to burning charcoal and increased the fire to provide great convenience and comfort to the grain-transporting laborers. The restaurant manager said, "Serving civilian laborers is equivalent to participating in the war effort." Because the restaurant assisted in war support work meritoriously, the Taihang Fourth Special District awarded them a plaque with the inscription "Meritorious Service in War Support". Commissioners Du and Liu, in a letter to Jincheng County Head Yang, praised it as a model restaurant.

    晋城工农饭店热忱招待民夫
    【本报讯】晋城小东关工农饭店协助战勤工作有功，荣受太行四专署表扬。工农饭店新开设不久，当陵川民夫运粮住在该店时，店员热心招待亲借碗筷给民夫用。该店原烧煤火，因天气寒冷，怕民夫受冻，特改烧炭火把火加大，给予运粮的民夫很大的方便及安慰，该店经理说：“招待民夫亦等于参战工作。”因该店协助战勤有功，太行四专署特奖予“功在战勤”的锦匾一面，杜、刘二专员致晋城杨县长函中，誉为模范店。
