    Licheng County Held a Meeting of Honored Veterans to Review Their Emancipation
    [This Newspaper Reported] Licheng held a county-wide meeting of honored and retired soldiers on the 6th of this month to review their emancipation. Currently, each honored veteran in the villages has an average of 3.6 mu of land. Only 19 poor peasant households remain. Middle peasant households have increased from 272 to 408, and prosperous middle peasant households have increased from 41 to 76. Rich peasant households have increased from 25 to 36. This year, they received 29,300 jin of honor grain, all of which has been invested in cooperatives. During the emancipation movement, most veterans struggled against landlords in their residing areas, and their prestige among the masses has further increased. 193 heroes and models of emancipation have emerged. However, some problems were also identified, such as insufficient consideration for honored veterans in the distribution of fruits, and some honored veterans being used by secret agents to deliberately make things difficult for cadres. In the end, everyone decided that major problems would be handled jointly by the county government and the county Veterans Affairs Management Committee, while general problems would be handled jointly by the district cadres and the district Veterans Affairs Management Committee. At the meeting, the Veterans Affairs Management Committee called on all honored and retired soldiers to become models in implementing government decrees, to teach their military skills to the militia and local armed forces, to focus on production and establish their households, and to launch a vigorous merit-making campaign.

    黎城全县荣军集会检查翻身
    【本报讯】黎城于本月六日召开全县荣退军人大会，检查翻身。现在各村荣誉军人每人平均已有三亩六分地，贫农仅剩十九户，中农由二百七十二户增至四百零八户，富裕中农由四十一户增至七十六户。富农由二十五户增至三十六户，今年领荣誉粮二万九千三百斤，全部投入合作社。在翻身运动中，大部军人与住地地主进行了斗争，在群众中威信比前更加提高。涌现出一百九十三个翻身英雄模范。但也检查出不少问题，如分配果实时对荣誉军人照顾不够，还有的荣誉军人被特务利用，故意和干部为难。最后大家决议：大问题由县府和县荣管会协同处理，一般问题由区干协同区荣管会处理。会上荣管会号召全体荣退军人成为执行政府法令的模范。把自己的军事技术教给民兵地方武装。好好生产建立家务，展开热烈的立功运动。（廷豪、履端）
