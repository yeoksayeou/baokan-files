Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 16th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the so-called "Patriotic and Rights Protection Movement" recently instigated by Jiang Jieshi, stating: At the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, after Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed "hearing a report on the implementation of the agreement on the China issue reached by the participating countries of the Three-Power Moscow Conference in December 1945," Jiang Jieshi instigated a group of his lackeys to stage a so-called "Patriotic and Rights Protection Movement." This shows nothing more than that Jiang Jieshi is a die-hard running dog of American imperialism. Jiang Jieshi, like an echo, invariably expresses abject welcome to every statement made by American imperialists (including Vandenberg and Hoover) regarding the China issue. Now he says he is "opposed to international interference." Who would believe that? American imperialism, under the guise of "mediation," interferes in our internal affairs. This time, Molotov proposed that the participating countries of the previous Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers make a report, which clearly means that the US should make a report. Exposing the US's interference under the guise of "mediation" will prevent American imperialism from interfering in China's internal affairs. This is obviously beneficial to the Chinese people, but only detrimental to American imperialists. All Chinese people should welcome this proposal. However, Jiang Jieshi actually opposes it, which shows that Jiang Jieshi is really not a Chinese person. He is a complete traitor, a running dog of American imperialism. Jiang Jieshi's so-called "patriotism" is loving America, not China. The "rights" that Jiang Jieshi "protects" are the ultimate decision-making power of the United States over Chinese affairs, not the protection of China's sovereignty. If Jiang Jieshi still had Chinese sovereignty in mind, he would never have proposed the so-called "final decision-making power of the United States" last June, nor would he have signed the "Sino-US Commercial Treaty," which completely betrayed China's sovereignty, last November. Jiang Jieshi's only backing now is American imperialism. He welcomes American intervention in China's internal affairs and fears any change in this situation because any change would be tantamount to announcing the death penalty for his traitorous dictatorship. We, the Chinese people, advocate that the Chinese people solve the Chinese problem themselves and oppose other countries interfering in China's internal affairs. To achieve this goal, the Chinese people advocate first changing the status quo of American imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs. Because American imperialism is the most reactionary imperialist in the world after the collapse of fascism, the Chinese people must first oppose interference in China's internal affairs by such an imperialist. American imperialism must get out of China! Such a demand is a truly patriotic and rights-protecting demand. Jiang Jieshi's "patriotism and protection of rights" is the traitorous act of a running dog of American imperialism.

### 记者发表评论称：  蒋介石的“爱国护权”是爱美国不是爱中国

　　新华社记者发表评论称：
    蒋介石的“爱国护权”是爱美国不是爱中国
    【新华社延安十六日电】新华社记者评论蒋介石最近所指使的所谓“爱国护权运动”称：莫斯科外长会议上，苏外长莫洛托夫提出了“听取一九四五年十二月三强莫斯科会议参与国关于当时所达到的中国问题协议的执行情形之报告”的建议之后，蒋介石嗾使其一群走狗闹一个什么“爱国护权运动”，这除了显示出蒋介石是美国帝国主义的一条死走狗而外，毫无任何意义。蒋介石对于美国帝国主义者（包括范登堡、胡佛在内）的每个关于中国问题的声明，像应声虫一样，必定表示五体投地的欢迎。现在倒说他是“反对国际干涉”的，试问有谁相信？美国帝国主义以“调解”为名干涉我国内政，此次莫洛托夫提议要前次莫斯科三强外长会议的参与国来做一个报告，这显然是要美国做报告。揭穿美国以“调解”之名行干涉之实，这起阻止美国帝国主义干涉中国内政的作用。这对于中国人民显然有利，只有对于美国帝国主义者才是不利的。凡是中国人，都应该欢迎这个提议。但是，蒋介石居然反对，足见蒋介石实在不是个中国人，他是个十足的汉奸，是美国帝国主义的走狗。蒋介石的所谓“爱国”是爱美国，不是爱中国。蒋介石的“护权”，“护”的是美国对中国事情的最后决定权，不是护什么中国的主权。如果蒋介石心目中还有中国主权，则去年六月蒋介石决不会提出所谓“美国的最后决定权”，去年十一月也决不会签订彻底断送中国主权的“中美商约”。蒋介石现在的唯一靠山就是美国帝国主义，他欢迎美国单独干涉中国内政，而且生怕这种情形会有任何改变；因为任何改变都等于宣布他的卖国独裁的死刑。我们中国人民主张中国问题由中国人民自己解决，反对别国干涉中国内政。为了达到这一目的，中国人民主张首先改变美国帝国主义干涉中国内政的现状。因为美国帝国主义是法西斯崩溃后世界上最反动的帝国主义者，中国人民必须首先反对由这样的帝国主义者来干涉中国内政，美国帝国主义必须滚出中国去！这样的要求，才真正是爱国护权的要求。蒋介石的“爱国护权”，乃是美国帝国主义走狗的汉奸行为。
