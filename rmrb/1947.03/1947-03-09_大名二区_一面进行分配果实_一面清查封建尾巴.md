　　Distributing Fruits While Investigating Feudal Remnants
　　[Jinan News, Hebei, 6th] The masses in Daming Second District are simultaneously distributing the fruits of victory and launching a large-scale review of the overthrown regime. Many hidden landlords and rich peasants with feudal remnants have been exposed and liquidated. The peasants have recovered a large amount of land. For example, in Dahuo Village, two landlord households were identified, and the peasants recovered 93 mu of land. Wang Ruheng in Dong'an Village appeared to be a middle peasant, but he owned a lot of land outside the village and actually lived by exploitation. In Fenshang Village, nine landlord households were originally struggled against, but their land was not thoroughly dealt with due to an unclear understanding of their outside land. This time, another seven households with more than 50 mu of outside land were identified and completely confiscated by the Farmers' Association. In Xidian Village, 17 landlord households were identified, and three qing of land were recovered. In Wang Village, Yan Yue Village, Han Village, and other villages, more than 200 mu of land have also been identified. These landlords concealed their status by using fake pledges, fake sales, and fake family divisions. Some landlords colluded with village cadres to escape the settlement.

    一面进行分配果实  一面清查封建尾巴
    【本报冀南六日电】大名二区群众一面分配果实，一面展开翻身大检查，许多隐蔽的地主及富农封建尾巴已被清算出来，农民收回大量土地，如大霍庄清算出两户地主，农民收回土地九十三亩，东安村王如恒表面是中农，但他的外庄地很多，实际上靠剥削度日。坟上村原斗争了九户地主，因对他们的外当地了解不清，未有彻底清算。这次又检查出七户外当地五十多亩，已完全收归农会。西店村清算出十七户地主，收回土地三顷。王庄、阎岳村、韩庄等村也清算出二百余亩土地。这些地主是用假当、假推、假分家等手段隐蔽了自己的成份，部分地主是拉拢村干，逃避了清算。
