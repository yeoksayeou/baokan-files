[This Newspaper Taihang 3rd Dispatch] In response to the call for meritorious service movement proposed in the People's Daily "February 7th" editorial, the Changzhi City Federation of Trade Unions has issued a letter of challenge to the Xingtai City and Taihang Second and Third Special District Federations of Trade Unions to carry out workers' movements and guarantee industrial production increases through friendly competition. The content includes: 1. Ensure that 100% of workers in all factories in the city enthusiastically participate in the production increase movement, with at least ten factories achieving overall improvement. 2. Create four typical factories as required in the "February 7th" editorial, ensuring sufficient raw materials, low costs, good quality, high output, and wide sales channels. 3. Continue to organize scattered small handicrafts in the form of cooperation. 4. Try to organize shop assistants to participate in the movement, such as strengthening the unity of Qiangdong partners and running the store well. 5. Double the size of the workers' armed forces (i.e., worker pickets who do not leave production). 6. Union cadres should go deep into factories, summarize experience at any time, and make cadres universally improve a step in the movement. The competition period is from March to July for five months. After receiving the letter of challenge, the Xingtai City and the Second and Third Special District Federations of Trade Unions all expressed their willingness to participate in this competition, and they are now discussing how to respond, and the competition conditions will be supplemented.

Also: The industrial production increase movement in Changzhi City has been widely launched. All factories have democratically discussed and formulated production increase plans with all employees. The Huafeng Iron Factory has taken practical action, and workers are not resting even on Sundays. The sand-turning workers are particularly enthusiastic. By working overtime for one day, they increased production by more than 2,000 catties of ironware, ten bench vises, two cotton ginning machine large wheels, and eight belt pulleys. The cotton ginning machine produced by the tap water company processing plant used to gin only fifteen catties of cotton per hour; now, after the worker Tian Jisong's transformation, it can gin thirty catties per hour, and it is better than before.

　　响应本报“二七”社论号召
    保证增产竞赛立功
    长市职工会向邢市等地发出挑战书
    【本报太行三日电】长治市职工会，响应人民日报“二七”社论所提出的立功运动，特向邢台市及太行二、三两专区职工会发出开展职工运动、保证工业增产进行友谊比赛的挑战书。内容包括：一、作到发动全市属工厂工人百分之百热烈参加增产运动，至少十个工厂达到全面提高。二、创造“二七”社论中所要求的典型工厂四个，作到原料足、成本低、质量好、产量多、销路广。三、以合作形式继续组织分散的小手工业。四、尽量组织店员参加运动，如强东合伙团结，办好商店。五、扩大工人武装一倍，（即不脱离生产的工人纠察队）。六、工会干部深入工厂，随时总结经验，使运动中干部普遍提高一步。以上竞赛时期为三月至七月五个月。邢市及二、三专区职工会于接到挑战书后，均表示愿意参加这一竞赛，现均在讨论如何回答，竞赛条件将有所补充。
    又：长市工业增产运动已普遍展开，各工厂均经全体职工民主讨论订出增产计划，华丰铁厂已实际行动起来，工人礼拜天亦不休息。翻沙工人特别起劲，加工一天就增产了二千余斤铁器、十把虎钳、两个弹花机大轮，八个皮带轮。自来水公司加工厂所出之弹花机，过去每小时只弹花十五斤；现经工人田吉松改造，每小时能弹三十斤，且比过去弹得好。
