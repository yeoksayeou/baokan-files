    The more thoroughly feudalism is eliminated,
    the more stable the border environment becomes.
    Sweep away feudal remnants from top to bottom.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 23rd] The land reform experience in the Yuanqu border area proves that the more thoroughly feudal forces are eliminated, the more stable the environment becomes; otherwise, the masses will have "change of dynasty" worries, and turmoil is bound to occur. When the mass movement began in Shang Dengban and Xia Dengban villages, they were afraid of provoking landlords to surrender to the enemy for revenge, so they adopted moderate measures, which gave the landlords an opportunity to exploit. Landlords used the following methods in an attempt to maintain feudal rule: (1) Moderating the relationship between landlord and tenant, with land ownership still belonging to the landlord. Tenants did not pay rent, but only paid burdens. Land of this type of rental totaled 112 mu. (2) False mortgages. In order to escape struggle, landlords falsely mortgaged 45.2 mu of land. The mortgage period was three years. (3) False land returns. Landlords such as Gao Yuwen, Gao Linqing, and Lü Ke Ren all pushed their land to village cadres and relatives, avoiding struggle. (4) Emphasizing care for landlords, leaving them fertile land and tall buildings, thus the feudal prestige was not overthrown, and the enthusiasm of the masses was not high. When the cadres saw the landlords, they greeted them with flattery, and when they saw the masses, they shook their heads with contempt. In this county-wide movement upsurge, the masses of the two villages rose again to struggle with the landlords, reclaiming 172 mu of land, 40 rooms, 11 cave dwellings, and a large amount of other grain and furniture from the landlords in five days. The landlords and despots were completely subdued, and Chiang's army lost its eyes and ears and dared not attack easily. The two villages changed from turmoil to tranquility.

    上下登坂扫清封建残余
    【本报太岳廿三日电】垣曲边沿区土地改革经验证明，封建势力愈消灭的干净，环境便愈安定；否则群众有“变天”顾虑，势必动荡不安。上登坂、下登坂两村在群众运动开始时，恐怕刺激地主投敌报复，于是采取缓和手段，结果给了地主钻空子的机会。地主采用以下方式，企图保持封建统治：（一）缓和租佃关系，地权仍属地主，佃户不出租子，只出负担。此类形式的租佃土地尚有一百一十二亩。（二）假典地。地主为了逃避斗争，假典出四十五亩二分地。典期皆三年。（三）假退地。如地主高玉文、高霖清、吕克仁都将土地推给了村干部与亲友，逃避了斗争。（四）强调照顾地主，给地主留下肥沃土地和高楼大厦，因此封建的威风未倒，群众热情不高，地主见了干部迎送恭维，见了群众摇头卑视，在此次全县运动高潮中，两村群众亦再起与地主斗争，五天内向地主索回土地一百七十二亩，房四十间，窑十一孔及其他粮食家具甚多。地主恶霸完全制服，蒋军失掉了耳目。不敢轻易出击。该两村变动荡而为安宁。
