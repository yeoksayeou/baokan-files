(From our newspaper in Taihang, 11th) After land reform in Gaoyi, the masses' awareness has been raised and they have automatically armed themselves. Now, in addition to strong militia, each village has large and small joint defenses. Each village has organized an armed self-defense force, using various new and old weapons to actively combat the activities of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and "Home-Returning Legions." On February 11th, more than 40 Chiang Kai-shek special agents and "Home-Returning Legion" members, carrying more than 20 rifles, went to Wangliu Village in the county's first district to rob. The militia immediately engaged the enemy in fierce fighting. After half an hour of battle, militia reinforcements from the joint defense arrived and drove the enemy back. On the night of the 13th, more than 120 enemies raided Maliu Village, Huayuan, Dafuzhuang and other villages in our first district. Militiamen from each village immediately engaged the enemy in street battles. The enemy attacking Maliu Village were unable to break through after several charges. The enemy attacking Huayuan Village were discovered by us, and the militia engaged the enemy in a grenade battle on the roof of the command post, while also shouting slogans. From the old men in their sixties and seventies to the ten-year-old children, all participated in the battle. For example, Guo Minglu, who had just been liberated, was only ten years old. As soon as he heard the gunfire, he ran to the command post, asked for a grenade, and went up to the roof with the militia: "The Communist Party liberated us, and you come to rob us of our good things. See if you dare to steal with that one hand!" The enemies attacking other villages also encountered the same resistance. That night, although the enemy desperately robbed 16 head of livestock, more than 50 quilts, and 160 pieces of clothing, they were intercepted by our joint defense militia and part of the independent battalion north of the city. The looted materials were recovered, seven enemies were killed, 16 were wounded, 17 enemies were captured alive, and five rifles and some ammunition were seized. But the enemy was not reconciled. On the night of the 14th, they went to Wancheng Town in our fourth district. Part of our militia held out against the enemy, and part of them turned to the outer line to ambush the enemy. When the enemy robbed six head of livestock and some quilts, and prepared to flee, they were fiercely attacked by our ambushing militia. The looted livestock and other property were recovered, five enemies were killed or wounded, and one pistol and three grenades were captured. After running into a brick wall in Wancheng, the enemy divided into two groups and looted Beipudi and Shijiazhuang. They were pursued by our joint defense militia, and all the looted goods and livestock were recovered. Two pistols, five bullets were seized, and three enemies were wounded.

(From our newspaper in Taihang, 11th) The militia of a certain village in Gaoyi actively responded to the call of their superiors to solve their own ammunition difficulties, and have learned to make their own landmines and grenades. After being trained in explosives last winter, Feng Rongshen, Li Goudan, and Li Wen of the village's explosives team worked hard to study and transform local weapons. The power of the grenades that did not explode has been increased after transformation, and raw materials have been saved. They first disassembled the broken grenades to carefully study their structure, found the source of the problem, and then loaded a certain amount of realgar, and then loaded some pieces of pig iron. In a few days, more than 50 were transformed, and nearby militiamen took broken grenades to ask them to transform them. The self-made detonators also have good results. Now, one person can make more than 20 detonators and load ten mines in one hour. One person can make five mines per hour from making to loading. Local masses and militiamen exchange broken grenades or landmines for them, and three can be exchanged for one.

　　高邑翻身农民齐心保家
    大小联防相互策应屡次打垮敌人进攻
    【本报太行十一日电】高邑经过土地改革，群众觉悟提高，自动武装起来。现各村除有坚强的民兵外，还有大小联防，每村组织了武装自卫队，利用各种新旧武器，积极打击蒋特“还乡团”的活动。二月十一日蒋特“还乡团”四十余人，揣步枪二十余支，到该县一区王留村抢劫，民兵即与敌人展开激战，经半点钟战斗，各联防支援民兵赶到，把敌人打退；十三日夜，敌一百二十余人，又到我一区马留村、花园、大夫庄等村抢掠，各村民兵即与敌展开巷战。到马留村之敌几次冲锋都没有冲进去；到花园村之敌，被我发觉后民兵在指挥部房上与敌人展开手榴弹战，并进行喊话。该村上自六七十岁的老头，下至十岁的小孩也都参加了战斗。如新翻身的郭明禄才十岁，一听枪响就跑到指挥部，要了一颗手榴弹随民兵一同上房了：“共产党给俺翻了身，你们来抢俺的好东西，看你那一只手敢抢？！”到其他村的敌人也同样遇到了打击。这夜敌人虽拚死命抢去十六头牲口、五十余条被褥、一百六十件衣裳，但到城北被我联防民兵与独立营一部截住，将抢的物资夺回来，并打死敌人七名、打伤十六名，活捉敌人十七名，得步枪五支及一部弹药。但敌人还不死心，十四日夜又到我四区万城镇，我民兵一部与敌坚持，一部即转入外线伏击敌人。当敌抢了六头牲口及一些被褥，准备逃窜时，遭我埋伏的民兵痛击，夺回被抢掠的牲口及其他财物，并毙伤敌人五名，缴获手枪一支、手榴弹三个。敌人在万城碰钉后又分两股到北蒲底、石家庄抢掠，被我联防民兵追击，将所抢东西及牲口全部夺回，并缴手枪二支、子弹五发、打伤敌人三名。
    【本报太行十一日电】高邑某村民兵积极响应上级号召，解决自已弹药困难，已学会自造地雷、手榴弹。该村爆炸队冯荣身、李狗旦、李文去冬受爆炸训练后，努力研究改造土武器，不响的手榴弹经改造后，较原先效力增大，且节省原料。他们首将坏手榴弹拆开仔细研究其构造，发现病源，继装入定量的剥雄黄，再装进一些生铁片子即成。几天内改造五十余个，附近民兵纷纷拿坏手榴弹请其改造。自造雷管，效果亦好，现一人一小时可造雷管二十余个、装雷十个，一人连造带装，每小时可造雷五个。当地群众民兵以坏手榴弹或地雷与之对换，三个可换一个。
