　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th—According to the recently received World News and Commentary Weekly (November 16, 1946): On July 21, 1945, French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez issued his famous appeal, calling on French miners to increase production. Communist Industrial Production Minister Paul has contributed more than any other minister to the victorious production movement. As a result of the efforts of the working class under the leadership of the General Confederation of Labor and the Communist Party, the production movement has achieved significant victories. Overall production has increased by one hundred percent in one year. Between October 1945 and September 1946, monthly iron production rose from 147,900 tons to 347,000 tons, and monthly steel production rose from 207,100 tons to 419,000 tons.
