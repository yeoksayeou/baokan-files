	Point Out Shortcomings and Recognize Contributions
	Cadres and Masses in Dongwang Town Eliminate Estrangement

[Our Newspaper] Ningnan Dongwang Town's adjustment of cadre-mass relations, paying attention to cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses, and commending the contributions of cadres, has achieved good results. Its main experiences are: 1. County and district cadres must first understand that they should not only see the problems of village cadres, but also their contributions in leading mass movements and other work. In adjusting relations, do not relax criticism of their mistakes because of their contributions, but also do not adopt the method of thoroughly criticizing and replacing cadres with new ones, as this will allow special agents and landlords to take advantage of the situation for a counterattack, and cause dissatisfaction among village cadres. The "on-stage" and "off-stage" will sow internal disputes, creating difficulties in the work. 2. Clear up the cadres' fear of future troubles, as well as the obstacles of "pleasing those above," "pleasing those below," and "pleasing the family." At the cadre meetings, it was clearly stated that the goal was not to struggle against cadres but to enable them to do a better job to the end. Being afraid of losing face is like a bald man covering his head with a towel; in fact, everyone knows the merits and demerits of the cadres. At the same time, three questions were raised for reflection: Are you the people's overlords? Have you forgotten the pain once the wound has healed? Are you still treating the masses with the style of before liberation? What harm is there to your work and yourself? In this way, the director of the Dongwang Farmers' Association cleared up the cadres' thinking and happily withdrew the over-distributed fruits. 3. Encourage the masses to express their opinions on the cadres, advocating "say what you have to say, don't let it become a hidden illness." After the opinions are expressed, guide the masses to recognize that "cadres are the sons of the people," and establish the idea that cadres have shortcomings but also have contributions. 4. After the cadres and masses have cleared their thinking, hold a "diagnose the illness and reconcile" meeting; at the meeting, encourage the masses to speak freely, and generally cadres should also take the lead in raising opinions, breaking down the barriers between the masses and cadres. After the masses have finished speaking, the cadres should confess their mistakes with a strict self-discipline attitude. Finally, propose "one good" and "two thoughts"; "one good" emphasizes the benefits of raising opinions; "two thoughts" are: think about whether the cadres had contributions in the past, and whether the mistakes were knowingly committed, or shortcomings in the work of progress. 5. In order to enable the masses to express their opinions fully, after the meeting, go separately to households or streets and alleys to chat with the masses to further understand what problems and confused ideas still exist, so as to continue to solve them. It was proposed to the cadres: good cadres should serve the people to the end.

    指出缺点认清功劳
    东汪镇干群解除隔阂
    【本报讯】宁南东汪镇调整干群关系，注意珍贵群众热情，并表扬干部功劳，取得良好结果，其主要经验为：一、县区干部，首先明确不但要看到村干的毛病，也要看到他们领导群运等工作的功劳。在调整关系上，不要因功劳就放松了他们的错误，但也不要对干部以深恶痛绝的打击去旧换新的办法，这样会叫特务地主钻空子反攻，村干不满。上台与下台的种下了内部的纠纷，造成工作中的困难。二、打通干部怕后患的思想，以及“上”“下”“家里”三不落好的障碍。在干部会上，响亮提出的不是斗干部而是使干部更好到底，怕丢人那就是秃子盖手巾，其实干部的优劣那个人都知。同时提出三想：是不是群众的上司？是不是好了疮忘了疼？是不是还以未翻身前的作风来对待群众？他给工作，给自己有啥害处？如东汪农会主任就这样打通了干部思想，很喜欢的退出了多分果实。三、启发群众说出对干部的意见，提倡“有啥说啥不要成了心病”。意见说出后并诱导群众认识“干部是人民的儿子”，树立干部是有缺点但也有功劳的思想。四、干部群众思想打通后，就开挖病与和好大会；会上启发群众发言，一般干部也要带头提意见，打破群众与干部的隔膜，群众说完后，干部要以严己责己的态度坦白自己错误。最后再提一好两想；一好中强调出提意见的好处；二想：想想过去干部有无功劳，错误是明知故犯，还是进步工作中的缺点。五、为了使群众把意见说尽，会后再分头到户或街头巷尾和群众扯一扯，再了解还有什么问题和糊涂观念，以便继续解决，对干部提出：好干部要为人民服务到底。
