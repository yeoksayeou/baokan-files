　　Greek People's Liberation Front
    Opposes US Aid to Reactionary Government
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] TASS, Athens, 6th: The Central Committee of the Greek People's Liberation Front recently issued a statement regarding the British and American declaration, stating: "The Greek people have never ceased demanding the withdrawal of British troops from Greece and believe that this is the most important condition for ensuring independence and democracy. At a time when the people have the possibility of realizing their demands, the United States has come forward to demand that British troops continue their occupation. The significance of American interference is to support the anti-democratic regime imposed on the Greek people from abroad, to continue supporting the indefinite prolongation of the domestic turmoil caused by the regime, thereby depriving Greece of its independence for a long time." The statement also stated: "If the United States insists on imposing this yoke on the Greek people, it will cause a wider uprising of the Greek people, regardless of the cost, to strive for national independence."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th] Under the guise of "preventing Greece from falling into the hands of the Communists," American imperialism has launched a movement to aid the Greek fascist regime, attempting to gain a foothold in the Eastern Mediterranean. According to various reports: US Secretary of State Marshall declared at a press conference on the 4th that "the Greek economy is on the verge of collapse." Truman and Congress have given it "urgent attention." The next day, the Turkish News Agency announced that the US ship "Amity" would soon arrive in Athens.

    【新华社延安十日电】塔斯社雅典六日电：希腊人民解放阵线中央委员会顷发表关于英美声明称：“希腊人民从未停止要求英军自希撤退，并相信这是确保独立与民主的最主要条件，在人民将有实现他要求可能之时，美国却出而要求英军继续其占领；美国干涉的意义，就是支持自国外强加于希腊人民头上的反民主的政权，继续支持该政权所引起的国内骚乱之无限期延长，从而长期剥夺希腊的独立”。声明又称：如果美国硬要将此枷锁加在希腊人民的头上时，将会引起希腊人民更广泛的起义，不顾一切代价以争取国家之独立”。
    【新华社延安八日电】美帝国主义在“防止希腊落入共产党手中”之烟幕下，已掀起援助希腊法西斯政权的运动，力谋插足于东地中海。据各方报导：美国务卿马歇尔四日招待记者会上宣称，希腊经济已处于崩溃边缘”，杜鲁门及国会均予以“紧急注意”，翌日土耳其新闻局并宣布美舰“密友”号即将开抵雅典。
