    Recalling the Bitter Past
    Resolving to Fill the "Deficit Households"
    Xiaowen Cadres Undergo Ideological Transformation, Voluntarily Return Ill-Gotten Gains
    [This dispatch from Ping Shun] In Xiaowen Village, Ping Shun, the cadres' class consciousness was raised by "recalling their own painful history and comparing it with the current suffering of the peasants who have not yet turned over," and they consciously returned the excess gains to the masses, thereby strengthening the unity between cadres and the masses. During the land reform in the village, the cadres improperly handled the fruits of struggle, resulting in individual "deficit households" not being able to thoroughly turn over. The cadres also created factional contradictions because of the distribution of the fruits of struggle. The public security director received an extra thatched house and a tree, and the deputy village chief spread rumors everywhere, saying that the public security director was stealing the fruits of struggle, etc. The masses' dissatisfaction with the cadres increased day by day. After understanding the situation, the district cadres first decided to take the lead on both sides and support both sides. In the people's school, the masses were allowed to boldly express their opinions, ensuring a thorough resolution. After two days of deliberation, the masses began to dispel their concerns about retaliation from the cadres and raised many issues concerning the unfair distribution of fruits of struggle and the cadres' work style. The leadership then summoned the cadres and encouraged them to conduct self-criticism. Initially, the public security officer believed that the masses' opinions were due to the cadres instigating each other and retaliating against each other. The village chief also said, "We have been making trouble for half a month, and we haven't gotten anything. In the end, we only got a wooden shovel." The political director said, "The two mu of good land I exchanged for, they insisted on me exchanging, so I exchanged." The self-criticism failed to go deep. The leadership suggested recalling the history of the eight-year War of Resistance and the life before the war, calculating the accounts of turning over, and comparing them with the "deficit households," so that the cadres could review themselves again. As a result, the public security director recalled that his family had been hired laborers for three generations. When the family was divided, the four people only received eight fen of land and were burdened with forty yuan of debt. In the twelfth month of the lunar year, the landlords forced them to pay their debts to the point of death. He couldn't even go home. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, he stole an elm tree, which he only exchanged for seven sheng of rice. It was finished by the ninth day! In the end, he sold his grandson with tears in his eyes to pay off the debt. In the several years of struggle, he had turned over, but he forgot that his poor brothers were still "deficit households." He couldn't help but cry out loud. The village chief recalled the scene when the landlord demanded debt and forced him to sell his sister. Now he had forgotten his roots after receiving eighty-six shi of grain. While speaking, his voice was filled with tears. Many cadres deeply felt painful about their wrong work style of ignoring the masses after they had turned over. After thorough reflection, everyone actively confessed their mistakes and were willing to return the excess gains. However, some cadres developed pessimism. They felt that "in the past, covering half of your face would make people "pity" you, but now you are being criticized!" The village chief said, "We openly distributed the fruits of struggle, but secretly took the fruits of struggle. How could the masses not raise objections?" The pessimists gradually realized that it was their own work style that was the problem. The public security director confessed on the spot that he had privately taken more than twenty items of fruit of struggle. The next day, the leadership encouraged the masses in the people's school to think about the merits of the cadres. When everyone recalled "how did we get through the eight-year War of Resistance," they unanimously agreed that they would not have made it without the cadres' painstaking leadership and struggle. After the cadres gained the understanding of the masses, they returned nine mu and six fen of land, one hundred and sixty trees, and many pieces of grain, furniture, and clothing on the spot, filling the "deficit" for sixteen households. The relationship between the cadres and the masses began to become closer. The whole village has organized fourteen mutual aid teams and six textile teams in an atmosphere of unity, preparing to devote all their efforts to the great production movement. (Lin Hua)

    回忆过去苦时光
    决心填平窟窿户
    孝文干部思想转变自退果实
    【本报平顺讯】平顺孝文村以“回忆自己的痛苦历史，和对比未翻身农民现在的痛苦”，提高干部的阶级觉悟，自觉的将多分果实退还群众，密切了干群团结。该村土地改革中，干部处理斗争果实不当，致使个别窟窿户未能翻透身。干部们也因为分果实闹开宗派矛盾，公安主任多分了一所茅房和一颗树，副村长就到处宣传，说公安主任偷斗争果实等等。群众对干部不满情绪，日益增加。区干部了解情况后，首先决定了两头作主，两面撑腰，在民校中让群众有话大胆提，保证彻底解决。经过两天酝酿，群众始解除怕干部报复的顾虑，提出干部分果实不公与作风上许多问题。领导上又召集干部，启发进行自我检讨，最初，公安员认为群众提意见是干部挑拨，互相报复。村长也说：“闹了半个月，什也没得上，最后才分了个木锨”。政治主任说：“我换的二亩好地，是人家非叫我换不行，我才换的。”检讨始终未能深入。领导上提出回想八年抗战历史及战前的生活，算算翻身账，对比窟窿户，让干部再检讨。这样一来，公安主任回想起自己三辈当雇工，分家的时候，四口人仅分八分地，还带着四十块外债。腊月天老财们逼死逼活的要账，自己有家不能回，大年初一偷了颗榆树，也只换了七升米，吃到初九就完啦！最后是捏着一把泪把孙子卖掉顶了账。几年斗争中，自己算是翻了身，却忘记从前的穷弟兄们现在仍是“窟窿户”，不禁失声痛哭起来。村长忆起当年老财要账，逼着自己卖了妹子的光景，而现在分了八十六石粮食就忘了本。说时声泪俱下，不少干部都对自己翻了身就不管群众的错误作风，深深感到痛苦。经过彻底反省，大家都纷纷自动讲出自己错误，愿意退出多分果实，个别干部中却产生悲观情绪。觉得“过去盖半个脸还有人“可怜”，现在反到被人家提开意见啦！”村长说：“咱明里分果实。暗里拿果实，群众还能不提意见？”悲观的人乃逐渐明确了，原来是自家作风有问题，公安主任当场坦白曾私拿果实二十余件。次日，领导上在民校中启发群众想想干部功劳。在大家回忆“八年抗战是怎样过来的”时，一致认为：不是干部苦心领导斗争，咱也过不来。干部取得群众谅解后，当场退出九亩六分地、树一百六十颗、粮食、家具、衣服多件，填平了十六户窟窿户干群关系开始密切起来。全村在团结的气氛中已组织起十四个互助组，六个纺织组，准备全力投向大生产运动。（林华）
