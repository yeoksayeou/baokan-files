Taihang, March 16th (Our Newspaper) – The Taihang Second and Fourth Administrative Offices both convened judicial conferences at the end of February to summarize the achievements and experiences of judicial work during last year's mass movement. They also studied how to implement a judicial policy of serving the people in the future, in order to consolidate the benefits of the peasants' emancipation and stabilize the democratic order after land reform. The Second Administrative Office meeting concluded that last year, judicial cadres of the Second Administrative Office and its ten-odd subordinate counties transformed court-based judicial work into judicial work going to the countryside, with everyone participating in the mass movement. On the one hand, they participated in mobilizing the masses; on the other hand, they used judicial power to support the masses, and promptly suppressed spies and special agents who sabotaged the mass movement. This also broke the view that judicial cadres have always emphasized their special status, believing that their job could not be combined with the central tasks of mass movement and production. Last year, counties such as Licheng created experiences in combining with production work. For example, when rectifying mutual aid, judicial cadres went to the countryside to help rectify mutual aid work, and at the same time mediated civil disputes between farmers in production mutual aid groups. Simultaneously, in the course of coordinating central tasks with judicial work in the countryside last year, all judicial cadres were educated. They realized that trials divorced from the masses, whether civil or criminal, were difficult to be reasonable. Particularly in dealing with spy cases, if the understanding of the materials and mass opinions was insufficient, it was easy to be deceived by their one-sided confessions and misuse the policy of leniency, resulting in mass dissatisfaction. Judicial work in the countryside not only makes it easier to understand all the materials of the case and absorb mass opinions, but also speeds up the conclusion of the case, so that the masses do not have to travel back and forth, and waste time and money, which does not affect the production of the masses. In the future, for civil cases in rural areas, that is, disputes between farmers, the "solving knots" method created in the mass movement will be adopted, and village mediation committees will be generally established to lead the masses to mediate themselves. And strengthen the district-level cadres to enable them to independently handle civil disputes and lead the village mediation committee. Village mediation organizations have begun to be organized in various places last year, and their role is very large. The candidates must be emancipated peasants, upright, capable, and trusted by the masses. The county judicial section should strengthen its leadership over the district and village mediation organizations. The Fourth Administrative Office meeting also emphasized the work of eliminating traitors in the border areas to strengthen the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet spies and traitors, and resolutely suppress the spies, special agents, and local bullies who carried out "counter-settlements" against the peasants. To this end, a public notice was specially resolved and announced, stating the crimes, death sentences, and confiscation of property of the main elements of this kind of restoration and counter-settlement and the slaughter of the people. Once they are arrested and brought to justice, they will be executed immediately. Anyone who announces a death sentence can be executed.

　　司法下乡群众称便
    太行二专署总结司法工作经验
    【本报太行十六日电】太行二、四两专署均于二月底先后召开司法会议总结去年群运中司法工作的成就与经验，研究今后如何贯彻为人民服务的司法方针以巩固农民的翻身受益与安定土地改革后的民主秩序。二专署会议总结称：去年二专署所属十余县司法干部变法庭司法为下乡司法，全体参加了群运。一面参加发动群众工作，一面即以司法权力为群众撑腰，及时镇压了破坏群运的奸特分子。如此并打破了司法干部一向强调特殊，认为岗位工作无法与群运、生产等中心工作结合的观点。黎城等县于去年并创造了与生产工作结合的经验，如在整顿互助时，司法干部下乡一面帮助整顿互助工作，一面即调解生产互助组中农民间所发生的民事纠纷。同时在去年配合中心工作下乡司法的工作中也教育了全体司法干部，认识了脱离群众的审讯无论民事、刑事均难入情入理。特别对奸特案件的处理，如了解材料与群众意见不够，易为其片面的供词所蒙蔽而乱用宽大政策，招致群众不满。下乡司法不仅易于了解案件的全部材料，吸收群众意见，且结案时间迅速，使群众无往返之劳与其时间盘川上的浪费，不致影响群众的生产。今后对农村中的民事案件亦即农民间的纠纷，采群运中创造的“解圪瘩”办法，普遍建立村的调解委员会，领导群众自行调解。并健全区级干部使有独立处理民事纠纷与领导村调委会的能力。村调解组织去年各地已开始组织，作用甚大，其人选一定要是翻身农民，正直有能力而又为群众信仰者。县司法科则应加强对此区村调解组织的领导。四专会议上并强调边地除奸工作以加强对蒋伪奸特的斗争，坚决镇压向农民进行“倒算”的奸特恶霸。为此特决议布告宣布此种复辟倒算、残杀人民罪大不赦的主要分子的罪状、死刑与没收其财产，一旦缉拿归案即予执行。凡宣布死刑者，人人得而诛之。
