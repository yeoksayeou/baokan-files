　　Sweat and Blood Unite to Defeat the Enemy
    永兴 Printing Bureau Holds Symposium for Model Workers
    Improving Quality and Reducing Costs
    [This Newspaper's Report] In order to improve printing and publishing work and launch a meritorious service campaign, the 永兴 Printing Bureau recently held a symposium for model workers and employees. Secretary Wang of the General Branch first spoke, saying: Thanks to the achievements of the 永兴 factory's first phase of the "Youth Work" and "Support the Front" movements, 46 young workers have been trained, greatly improving everyone's skills. Last December, the printing of Commander Liu's book "Combined Tactics" received commendation from the leaders, and the printing of the "People's Daily" was also completed one day ahead of schedule. The criticisms and opinions from the outside world about our printing being "bad," "slow," and "expensive" are changing. However, further efforts are still needed to improve quality and reduce costs in the future! Next, Wang Yongzhi, a model type-casting worker, said: "The type-casting factory has recently made some new innovations. We have implemented a personal production registration system, and the output has increased by 40% compared to before (in the past, less than 1,000 characters were cast per hour, but now more than 1,400 are cast). In terms of savings: In the past, the type-casting furnace burned 17-20 catties of charcoal per shift, but recently, after switching to briquettes, it only burns 4-6 catties of large charcoal."
    Labor worker Li Tianchang, is a model of thrift in the "Support the Front" movement. He suggested that everyone should treat public property as if it were their own, saying, "I used to herd sheep for 20 years. When the owner gave them to me, I didn't want anyone to take even a strand of wool. After I came to the factory, I valued public property even more than my own." Finally, they discussed setting individual plans, with apprentices planning how to learn skills, and experienced workers planning how to train young workers and how to increase output. Comrades Fu Lianjun and Zhang Shoutan, the "Old Hens" (model experienced workers), proposed that technical work should be "careful and meticulous," opposing the idea of "reaching the sky in one step" and complacency with the status quo. Zhao Shudian, a model young worker, shared his experience, saying: "The improvement of skills mainly depends on the self-study and hard work of us apprentices. I plan to spend two hours every Sunday studying techniques in the future." Secretary Liu encouraged everyone to maintain the glorious title of model worker, learn from the masses, lead everyone, and leave their names on the "merit book" of the Self-Defense War. After the meeting, every comrade, with high enthusiasm, wanted to launch a competition between factories, between work groups, and between individuals.

　　血汗结合打败敌人
    永兴印刷局劳模工友座谈
    提高质量减低成本
    【本报讯】为提高印刷出版工作，开展立功运动，永兴印刷局于日前举行劳模工友座谈会。汪总支书首先发言说：由于永兴厂第一阶段的“青工”“支运”成绩，已培养了四十六位青年工人，使大家的技术大大的提高了一步。去年十二月印刘师长的《合同战术》一书，受到了首长的奖励，《人民日报》的印刷过程亦提前了一天，外面对我们印刷“坏”“慢”“贵”的批评和意见，已在改变中。但今后质量的提高，成本的减低，还须更努一把力！接着模范铸字工人王永治说：“铸字厂最近有些新创造，我们已实行了个人生产登记制度，产量已较前提高了百分之四十（过去每小时铸字不足一千个，现在则铸一千四百多个）。在节约方面：铸字炉过去一班烧炭一七——二○斤，最近改烧煤糕后，只烧大炭四——六斤就行了。”
    劳力工人李天长，他是“支运”中的节约模范。他提议在爱护资财上，要大家把公家的东西看成和自己的东西一样，他说：“我过去放羊廿年。主家交给我，我是不愿叫别人拿去一根羊毛的。我到工厂后，对公家资财比我的东西看得更宝贵。”最后讨论订个人计划，练习学徒订出如何学习技术，成工就订出如何培养青工、如何增加产量，“老母鸡”（模范成工）傅连军、张寿潭等同志提出在技术上要“精耕细作”反对“一步登天”和满足现状的想法。模范青工赵书典谈他的经验说：“技术的提高还主要依靠咱们学徒的自学和苦学。我计划以后星期天也抽两小时学习技术。”刘秘书鼓励大家要保持模范的光荣称号，学习群众，带领大家，在自卫战争的“功劳簿”上留下名字。会后每个同志都以高度热情，要展开厂与厂、工作间与工作间、个人与个人的竞赛。
