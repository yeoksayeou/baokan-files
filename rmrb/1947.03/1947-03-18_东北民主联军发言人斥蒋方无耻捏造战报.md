　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th—Just as Du Yuming, Chiang's Northeast Security Commander, and the notorious Central News Agency were brazenly boasting that they had "completely crushed" the Northeast Democratic Allied Army and were advancing in separate routes across the river towards Harbin, the news that the Northeast Democratic Allied Army had annihilated over 6,600 enemy troops of Chiang's 88th Division and other units northwest of Dehui immediately provided a powerful irony. A spokesperson for the Democratic Allied Army Headquarters told reporters about the facts of Chiang's shameless rumors and our military victory, stating first: "Du Yuming and the Central News Agency sincerely wished to 'completely crush' us, but this is only their subjective wish. To broadcast a subjective wish as fact is called spreading rumors. The Democratic Allied Army did indeed annihilate Du Yuming's 88th Division and routed the 87th Division, at a location from Kaoshantun to Nong'an line northwest of Dehui, from the evening of the 9th to the 10th of this month." He then described the course of this operation: "In this operation, our army seized the initiative and advanced in great strides towards the Jilin-Changchun area. In the battle of Chengzijie, we annihilated three battalions, including the 89th Regiment of the New 1st Army's 30th Division. Following this, the enemy in Jiutai and Nong'an fled in panic. Du Yuming said this was 'limited to confidential matters that cannot be announced.' I will provide an annotation for him: the so-called 'confidential' means insufficient troop strength and fear of being annihilated. Du Yuming said that 'the elders of Changchun and Jilin suffered a scare' and considered it 'unfortunate,' but in reality, it was Du Yuming and his colleagues who were truly frightened. As early as the end of February, foreign news agencies in Shanghai had already reported that the families of Chiang's soldiers had retreated to Shenyang, but Du Yuming, disregarding the emptiness of the western, southeastern, and southern Manchurian regions, hastily transferred the 87th and 88th Divisions north (at this time, our army in western and southeastern Manchuria recovered Kailu, Liuhe, Jinchuan, Nan and other county towns). When we took the initiative to move backward, the stupid Du Yuming began to boast about 'pursuing in separate routes with irresistible force,' the 'success of the strategy of luring the enemy deep,' 'the Communists suffered 30,000 casualties,' 'there are no more Communists south of the Songhua River, and the national army has completed its counterattack mission'.... The Kuomintang reactionaries even clamored that Chiang's army was only sixty-nine li away from Harbin. Chiang Kai-shek fully encouraged him, issued commendation orders, and sent awards. Just as he was floating in a sea of self-praise, in the battle northwest of Dehui, Chiang's 88th Division was completely annihilated. At this time, Du Yuming demonstrated that he was 'not good at publicity,' and the Central News Agency couldn't make a 180-degree turn, saying that the Democratic Allied Army had 'risen from the ashes and made a comeback.'" Regarding the attack on Harbin, the spokesperson asked: "Don't Chiang Kai-shek and Du Yuming always want to occupy Harbin? Before, they said they would take it within five days, and this time they said it would take ten days. But Chiang's soldiers are spreading words like this: 'Go be a free soldier'! Under the influence of the Democratic Allied Army's policy of treating prisoners leniently, they all long to come to the liberated areas, withdraw from the civil war as soon as possible, and get rid of the evil war waged by Chiang Kai-shek. Large numbers of Chiang's soldiers are laying down their weapons and coming to the liberated areas to be free soldiers. In short, low morale, insufficient troops, attending to one thing and neglecting another, and increasingly falling into passivity—this is the true situation of Chiang's army in the Northeast today, and no amount of rumor-mongering and boasting can cover it up."

　　东北民主联军发言人斥蒋方无耻捏造战报
    【新华社东北十五日电】正当蒋家东北保安司令杜聿明和臭名远扬的中央社在放肆吹嘘他所谓“一举击溃”了东北民主联军，并已分路渡江向哈尔滨前进时，东北民主联军在德惠西北歼灭蒋军八十八师等部六千六百余人的消息，立刻给了一个有力的讽刺。民主联军总部发言人顷将蒋方无耻造谣与我方军事胜利的事实告诉记者，首称：“杜聿明与中央社是真心满想‘一举击溃’我们的，但是这仅仅是他们主观愿望而已，把主观愿望当作事实呱啦呱啦广播，这就叫造谣了。而民主联军却确确实实歼灭了杜聿明的八十八师，击溃了八十七师，地点是德惠西北靠山屯至农安一线，时间是本月九日至十日晚间。”继即叙述此次作战经过：“此次我军掌握主动，大踏步向吉长地区前进，城子街一战即歼灭新一军第三十师之八十九团等三个营，接着九台、农安之敌即行逃窜。杜聿明说这是“限于机密事宜不能宣告”，我来替他下个注解，所谓“机密”者、兵力不足，怕被歼灭之谓也。杜聿明说“长吉两地父老饱受虚惊”而引为“不幸”，其实真正饱受惊吓的只是杜聿明及其同僚。早在二月底，上海的外国通讯社就已报道蒋军家眷已向沈阳撤退，但是杜聿明仍不顾其西东南满三方的空虚，急调八十七、八十八等师北上（此时西满、东南满我军收复开鲁、柳河、金川、南等县城）。当我主动向后运动时，蠢笨的杜聿明就自吹自擂起来了，什么“分路追击势如破竹”，“诱敌深入战略的成功”，“共军伤亡达三万人”，“松花江南岸已无共军，国军反击任务已完成”……。国民党反动派甚至喧嚷蒋军离哈尔滨只六十九里了。蒋介石为之充分打气，颁发了表扬令，送去了嘉奖章。正在轻飘飘吹得热闹的时候，德惠西北一战，蒋军八十八师全军覆没，这时杜聿明就表现得“不长于宣传之道”了，中央社也转不过一百八十度的湾，说民主联军又“死灰复燃，卷土重来了。”谈到进攻哈尔滨，发言人发问道：“蒋介石、杜聿明辈不是时时刻刻想占哈尔滨吗？以前他们说是五天之内拿下来，这次又说要十天了，但是蒋军士兵中却流行着如此的话：“当自由兵去”！——在民主联军优待俘虏政策影响下，他们都渴望来解放区，早日退出内战，摆脱蒋介石所进行之罪恶战争，大量的蒋军放下武器到解放区来当自由兵了。总之，士气低落，兵力不足，顾此失彼，日益陷入被动，这就是今天东北蒋军的真正情况，任何造谣吹牛都是掩盖不住的。”
