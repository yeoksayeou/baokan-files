　　Land Reform Movement

    Experiences in the Deepening and Consolidation Phase and Future Tasks
    Speech by Comrade Li Xuefeng at the联席 Meeting of County Secretaries of the Fifth District Committee
    On February 10th, the Fifth District Committee convened a联席 meeting of county secretaries from various counties to summarize the deepening movement of the past two months. After detailed reports and enthusiastic discussions from each county, Comrade Li Xuefeng of the District Party Committee delivered a summary report of over ten thousand words titled "Experiences and Future Tasks of the Deepening and Consolidation Phase of the Land Reform Movement in the Fifth District."

    Comrade Xuefeng first pointed out that the deepening movement in various counties over the past two months has made great progress and created rich experiences, which should be summarized and promoted. At the same time, he raised new issues that need to be resolved to push the movement to a universal and in-depth level and complete the historical task of "land to the tiller."

    Mobilizing Poor and Hired Peasants, Uniting Middle Peasants - Still the Basic Policy for Mobilizing the Backward

    Regarding the issue of facing the backward, mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, and uniting the broad masses of middle peasants for full mobilization, Comrade Xuefeng pointed out: backward masses are generally still extensive. This includes a considerable portion of poor and hired peasants and their women, a considerable portion of military dependents and middle peasants. Therefore, mobilizing the poor and hired, and uniting the middle peasants, remains the basic policy for mobilizing the backward. The first obstacle to mobilizing backward masses is that our cadres are satisfied with the large scale of the great movement and assume that it is almost complete. It is necessary to recognize that our work is often unbalanced. Leaders should personally investigate the actual situation of the movement, and personally work in several villages to gain experience, repeatedly educating cadres from the actual experience of the movement's development to overcome complacency. The second obstacle is the resistance of village cadres. The reasons are: most of the village cadres are leading groups with poor peasants as the backbone, but they lack class consciousness and mass consciousness, or cadres of middle peasant origin are in power and have factionalism, or backward cadres protect landlords, etc., thus resisting thorough land reform; or they are bound by the historical experience of rent reduction, inheriting the old methods of struggle, such as whoever raises an opinion gets the fruit, and whoever is active gets more fruit. They despise the backward, do not see the problems and voices of the backward masses; or they are arrogant and meritorious, heroically monopolizing and bestowing favors, mainly unwilling to mobilize the poor and hired and cultivate a large number of new activists. The experience of breaking this obstacle is: it is necessary for the masses to criticize and expose cadres, and fully vent the dissatisfaction of the masses. Without this, the masses cannot be mobilized, and the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses cannot be brought into play. Secondly, it is necessary to resolutely persuade cadres to make self-criticisms, withdraw from the over-gained fruits of struggle, and correct mistakes. This is the main key to solving the relationship between cadres and the masses. Without this, it will inevitably lead to the masses opposing the cadres, affecting the division within the masses. Then, guide the masses to calmly examine the cadres, assess their merits and demerits, and approve the cadres. Continue to expose the sabotage activities of bad elements from enlightening the masses to tell the truth, so that the masses unite around the cadres. Then, mobilize the masses to fully pour out their grievances, select new activists, form new leadership groups, and quickly launch a struggle against the landlords. Without this, previous efforts will be wasted, and the movement will not be able to develop.

    Solving the Relationship Between Cadres and the Masses - Breaking the Obstacle to Mobilizing the Backward

    The so-called problem of backward villages, one is that landlords, special agents or their lackeys actually control the village administration; one is that cadres have degenerated, protecting landlords, and the masses have not been mobilized; one is that it has just started, but has been taken back by landlords and special agents. In this situation, the poor and hired are often not mobilized, the middle peasants are struggled against, the masses are unwilling, there is nothing on the surface, but it is actually not active at all. The landlords pretend to be enlightened, pretend to struggle, pretend to donate land, disperse their property, use cadres to block the higher authorities, and even truly attack the mass leaders, or cover up the class essence in the form of factional struggles. The experience of breaking this obstacle is: directly approach the poor and hired peasants or the middle peasants who have been attacked, establish a new leadership core through the complaints of individual poor and hired peasants and middle peasants, resolutely support the masses and make decisions for them, and boldly remove cadres based on the awakening of the masses, track down the backstage, or unite with the original upright cadres, isolate the worst ones, transform or establish a leadership group from the movement, and seize the militia regime; and boldly develop the movement, quickly distribute the fruits of struggle, and accomplish it at one go to consolidate the mobilization of the masses.

    Secondly, there is the issue of mobilizing the poor peasants. The poor and hired are the most resolute in the revolution, but because feudal oppression is too cruel, too vicious, and too insidious, many backward views, such as "conscience is doomed," cannot be eliminated at once. In addition, the active cadres despise them, so it is not easy to mobilize them all at once. According to the experience of various counties, they pour out their grievances, divide the class boundaries between peasants and landlords, enlighten the class consciousness of the poor and hired peasants, make them understand the relationship with the Communist Party, and the relationship with the middle peasants, improve their revolutionary determination, and make them become the backbone of the movement.

    Thirdly, there is the issue of uniting the middle peasants. Experience has proved that uniting the middle peasants requires the awakened poor and hired to unite them. At the same time, it is necessary to guide the middle peasants to recall their painful history and the history of turning over, educate the middle peasants to help the poor and hired to turn over, and make the middle peasants break with the landlords ideologically and politically from the division of classes. Publicize that "land to the tiller" not only does not infringe upon the middle peasants, but is also beneficial to the middle peasants, mobilize the middle peasants to participate in the struggle, obtain the fruits of struggle, and expose the landlords' exploitation conspiracies, reveal the landlords' hidden property, and "expose" the landlords' special agent activities. For middle peasants who have bad habits and are dissatisfied with the poor and hired, use the method of "washing their faces and wiping them black" to solve the problem within the peasants, but do not hurt the middle peasants. If they have been hurt, appropriate compensation should be given. In the movement, the production activities of the middle peasants should also be taken care of.

    Fourthly, there is the issue of mobilizing women. Generally, women are placed among the poor and hired to be mobilized, such as holding family meetings, where men and women compare progress. Cultivate women activists and leaders, and make extensive use of activists to lead the broad masses of women to participate in the entire struggle. At the same time, directly mobilize women to fight against landlord women, absorb women to participate in the distribution of fruits, respect women's opinions, and take care of women's demands. In areas where a large number of men are participating in the war, mobilize women to fight alone, making them the main force of the struggle, improving their social and family status, and breaking the men's contempt for women, but it should be combined with organizing women, textile production, and establishing housework.

    Developing Backward Villages - Work and Economy

    Regarding the issue of eliminating feudalism while giving consideration to all kinds of people and landlords, Comrade Xuefeng pointed out: Eliminating feudalism is our Party's firm goal, and how to eliminate it is a very complex issue. The experience of the past two months has proved that the "resistance" of landlords is quite tenacious. To completely break the landlords' "resistance" and completely eliminate feudalism, we still need tremendous efforts, deepening and deepening again, eliminating the landlords' clerks, sky accounts and other restoration capital. At the same time, there must be firm policies to give appropriate consideration to landlords who truly bow their heads, so that they can live and move towards production.

    Conducting Systematic Ideological Education - Launching a Conscious Solidarity Movement

    Regarding ideological education and the solidarity movement, Comrade Xuefeng talked about: In order to carry out the mass conscious solidarity movement, various places can adopt the methods of intensive training and winter school, combined with the overall peasant solidarity conference, to specially carry out a systematic ideological education for a period of time. After the masses themselves educate the cadres, the masses educate the masses, and the masses educate the cadres. From the perspective of class, the poor and hired educate each other, women educate women, and the poor and hired and middle peasants educate each other, to carry out a mass self-education and self-study conscious movement. At the same time, we must also launch a solidarity movement to resolve opinions and contradictions between the masses, between the poor and hired, between those who started early and those who started late, between various mass organizations, between party branch members, and between the party and the masses, creating a broad solidarity movement.

    Use the mass conscious solidarity movement to liquidate and overcome blind sectarianism. On the other hand, consolidate and promote the new revolutionary traditional spirit in the anti-feudal struggle, and apply this new spirit to future production movements and patriotic self-defense struggles. In terms of work style, we must establish a revolutionary action of labor practice, overcome the extremely lax and rogue habits of the old society, establish a new work style of loving the people and respecting cadres among the people and cadres, and overcome the old work style of being detached from the masses and having a small collective viewpoint. This movement should still absorb and cultivate a large number of new activists, rapidly transform and expand the leadership group, connect with the broad masses, and absorb a large number of outstanding members into the Party. The Party branches and Party members should participate in the great conscious solidarity movement together with the masses. Party members should educate the masses, and the masses should educate the Party members, and the Party branches should be trained and developed to truly become a mass Party.

    In terms of education methods, when carrying out this movement, intensive training methods can be adopted, absorbing activists and ordinary people, absorbing a large number of poor and hired, and also absorbing some middle peasants, training together, which is convenient for giving play to the methods of the mass line. After intensive training, then go to the villages and streets to carry out activities. Here, the method of peasant university can also be adopted, batch by batch, step by step, to expand the active members to the maximum extent. After intensive training, you can open poor and hired peasants' associations, peasant family associations, women's associations, all the way to the overall peasant conference. Winter school is the main activity place. In winter school, inside and outside winter school, free activities are carried out in classes and groups, breaking the previous winter school education methods and adopting a broad mass line method.

    The spirit of education is mainly to promote the mass heroic spirit in the movement to turn over, and overcome the bad ideas left over from history from comparative education. Do not simply recall the tragic life in history, do not simply emphasize reflection, and mainly adopt the method of discussing and telling stories. In short, this conscious movement should be filled with vivid, lively, happy and majestic emotions.

    Ideological Education Content

    There are the following points in the education content: Land and labor ideology: Let the masses clarify who is the master of the land, so that the masses understand that the working people are the orthodox, working to turn over, working to become rich, working is noble, and parasitism is the most shameful. Class ideology: Make the peasants clear about the past and present status of the poor and hired peasants, the peasants are one family, the victory and future of the peasant revolution, and the relationship between the peasants and the Communist Party. Armed ideology: Establish the idea that the peasants are armed to defend the victory of turning over, defend the land, defend the liberated areas, and defend the motherland. Therefore, it is proposed that outstanding members should participate in the militia self-defense team, care about the militia, review the militia, participate in the army, support the army, love the army and its families, enlighten the masses to give preferential treatment to the military and take care of the military dependents from landlord origin, and combine with practical activities to check the preferential resistance, commend the models, and sign self-defense and anti-espionage joint defense treaties. The ideology of liberating women and caring for youth: Let the broad masses understand the contribution of women in the war to turn over, and the vast role in production. Educate women to establish housework and appropriately participate in social activities. Eliminate the feudal ideas of despising women and abusing women. Educate everyone to recognize the contribution of young people in land reform, to love them; educate young people to learn from adults, respect adults, and cultivate and mobilize a large number of revolutionary reserves from the ideological and solidarity levels.

    Where there are contradictions between workers and peasants, workers should be absorbed to participate in this movement. Or after the trade unions and peasant associations mobilize independently, then convene a worker-peasant solidarity conference, or absorb workers to participate from intensive training to village activities. Focus on educating members, especially poor and hired peasants, so that they understand that peasants are the predecessors of workers, and in the future, they will greatly develop industry and absorb peasants to participate in work, and understand the importance of handicrafts to peasants. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the organization of workers, educate workers, and let workers learn and discuss together with peasants in the countryside, and not fall into isolation. The solution to contradictions should be solved from the ideological movement, and the government should also make adjustments in the administrative and other laws.

    This movement is also a production mobilization conference. In this period of conscious solidarity movement, we must take care of women's textile and spring peasant production time, and the movement time should not be too long. At the end of the movement, we should hold a solidarity conference of working people to mobilize the masses to organize, and order home-based plans. And mobilize cadres and activists to play a model role in the production movement, and help discover and cultivate new heroes in the production movement.

    Mass Organization Building

    Regarding the issue of organization building, Comrade Xuefeng talked about: In the later stage of the in-depth movement and in ideological education, we must greatly develop various organizations. On the basis of broad democratic life, and taking care of the mass production time, we must establish a vivid life for various organizations. This kind of organizational life activities should be combined with winter school, and should not be restricted to a certain form. The task of the organization is to organize mass life activities, not to restrain the masses. Only in this way can we improve the prestige of various organizations and the actual ability to unite the masses. This is to consolidate the victory of uniting the masses from the organization. The activities of the organization should adapt to the lives of the masses and should take diverse forms. Basic organizations should not be too many, and the form should not be too strict. The village-level leading organization should be simple, and in each mass movement, a variety of forms should be adopted.

    In the concluding remarks of the report, Comrade Xuefeng pointed out that all localities should implement unified leadership and rectify discipline, in order to unify the use of forces and carry out work. At the same time, he advocated the merit-making movement, commended heroes, advocated using the brain, and gave play to the creativity of cadres. The leadership should use the experience of cadres to educate cadres, especially to improve cadres from the ideological method and leadership method, and also improve themselves.

　　土地改革运动
    深入巩固阶段经验与今后任务
    李雪峰同志在五地委县书联席会上的发言
    二月十日五地委召开各县县书联席会议，总结两个月来的深入运动。经各县详尽汇报热烈讨论后，由区党委李雪峰同志以“五分区土地改革运动深入巩固阶段的经验与今后任务”为题，作了万余言的总结报告。
    雪峰同志首先指出两个月来各县深入运动有很大的发展，创造了丰富的经验，应加以总结发扬。同时又提出了新的问题，要加以解决，把运动推向普遍深入，完成耕者有其田的历史任务。
    发动贫雇团结中农  仍为发动落后基本方针
    关于面向落后、发动贫雇、团结中农充分动员广大群众问题，雪峰同志指出：落后群众一般还是广大的。其中包括相当部分的贫雇农及其妇女，相当部分的军属与中农，因此发动贫雇，团结中农，仍是发动落后的基本方针。发动落后群众的第一个障碍，是我们干部满足于大运动的猛烈规模，自以为差不多。必须认识我们的工作常常是不平衡的，领导上应亲自动手去考查运动的实际情况，并亲自作几个村取得经验，反复多次的从运动发展的实际经验上教育干部克服自满情绪。第二个障碍是村干部的抵抗。其原因是：村干部大部是贫农为骨干的领导集团，但缺乏阶级思想、群众思想，或者是中农成分干部当政，而有宗派主义，或者落后干部包庇地主等，因之抵抗彻底的土地改革；或者为历史上减租经验所束缚，他们继承着老一套的斗争方法，与谁提意见谁得果实，谁积极谁多分的分果实办法。轻视落后，看不见落后群众的问题与呼声；或则自大居功英雄式的包办恩赐，主要不愿去发动贫雇与培养大批新积极分子。打破这个障碍的经验是：必须要群众批评揭发干部，尽情的发泄群众不满情绪。不如此就不能动员群众，发挥群众的热情与智慧。其次必需坚决说服干部作自我批评退出多得斗争果实，改正错误，这是解决干部与群众关系的主要关键。不如此就必然造成群众反对干部，影响群众内部的分裂。然后引导群众冷静的检查干部，评定干部功过，批准干部，继任从启发群众说老实话中“蹬展”坏分子的破坏活动，使群众团结到干部的周围。再发动群众充分诉苦，选拔新的积极分子，组成新的领导集团，迅速开展对地主斗争。不如此就将前功尽弃，运动就无从开展。
    解决干部群众关系  打破发动落后障碍
    所谓落后村问题，一种是实际上是地主特务或其狗腿掌握村政大权；一种是干部蜕化，包庇地主，群众没有发动起来；一种是刚刚搞开，又被地主特务夺回。这种情况，常是贫雇未发动，中农被斗争，群众不肯，表面没啥，实际毫不活跃。而地主则假开明，假斗争，假献田，分散自己财产，利用干部封锁上级，甚至真正的打击群众领袖，或从宗派斗争形式，掩盖阶级的实质。打破这个障碍的经验是：直接接近贫雇农或受打击的中农，经过个别贫雇农中农的诉苦串通建立新的领导核心，坚决给群众撑腰作主，并大胆的依据群众的觉悟，撤换干部，追寻后台，或团结原有干部中正派的，孤立最坏的，从运动中改造或建立领导集团，掌握民兵政权；并且放手把运动发展下去，迅速分配斗争果实，一气呵成，以巩固群众的发动。
    其次是发动贫农问题。贫雇是革命最坚决的，但因封建压迫太残酷、太毒辣、太阴险，所以也有不少落后良心命运在天等观点就不能一下去掉。加上干部积极分子对他们轻视，就不易一下发动起来，根据各县经验，他们诉苦，划分农民与地主的阶级界限，启发贫雇农的阶级思想，使其了解与共产党的关系，与中农的关系，提高其革命坚决性，使其成为运动中的骨干。
    第三是团结中农问题。经验证明，团结中农，要由贫雇觉悟起来去团结。同时要引导中农回忆自己痛苦历史与翻身历史，教育中农要帮助贫雇翻身，从划分阶级中使中农在思想上政治上与地主决裂。宣传耕者有其田，不但不侵犯中农，而且对中农是有利的，动员中农参加斗争，分得果实，并使其暴露地主的剥削阴谋，揭发地主隐藏财产“蹬展”地主的特务活动，对有败症为贫雇所不满的中农，要用洗脸擦黑的办法，在农民内部解决，但不要刺伤中农。如已刺伤的，应适当加以补偿。在运动中并要照顾中农生产活动。
    第四是发动妇女问题。一般是把妇女放到贫雇农中去发动，如开家庭会，男女比进步。培养妇女积极分子和领袖，大量运用积极分子，使其带领广大妇女参加整个斗争。同时要直接发动妇女去斗争地主妇女，吸收妇女参加分配果实，尊重妇女意见，照顾妇女要求。在男人大批参战地区，发动妇女单独斗争，使其成为斗争主力，提高其社会家庭地位，打破男人对女人的轻视，但要与组织妇女、纺织生产、建立家务结合起来。
    开展落后村  工作经济
    关于消灭封建而又给各色人等各色地主以照顾问题，雪峰同志指出：消灭封建是我党坚定的目标，如何去消灭是一个很复杂的问题。两个月的经验证明，地主“抵抗”是相当顽强的。要完全打破地主“抵抗”，彻底消灭封建，还需要我们巨大的努力，深入再深入，消灭掉地主的文书天账等复辟资本。同时要有坚定的政策，给真正低头的地主以适当的照顾，使其能生活下去，并走向生产。
    进行系统思想教育  开展自觉团结运动
    关于思想教育与团结运动问题，雪峰同志谈到：开展群众自觉团结运动，各地可采取集训和冬学方式，结合全体农民团结大会，专门作一段系统的思想教育。经过群众自己进行干部教育群众，群众教育群众，群众教育干部。从阶层上讲，贫雇相互教育，妇女教育妇女，及贫雇中农在一起的相互教育，开展一个群众自教自学自觉运动。同时也要开展一个团结运动，解决群众之间，贫雇之间，先起与后起之间，各种群众组织之间，支部党员之间，党与群众之间的意见和矛盾，造成广大的团结运动。
    以群众自觉团结运动来清算克服盲目的宗派主义。另方面巩固发扬反封建斗争中新的革命传统精神，把这新精神运用到今后生产运动爱国自卫斗争中去。在作风上要建立劳动实际的革命行动，克服旧社会极端涣散流氓习气，在人民与干部中建立爱民尊干的新作风，克服脱离群众小集体观点的旧作风。这个运动仍然要吸收培养大批新的积极分子，急速改造与扩大领导集团，连系广大群众，并吸收大批优秀分子入党。党的支部与党员要和群众在一起参加伟大的自觉团结运动，党员教育群众，群众又教育党员，把党的支部，锻炼发展真正成为群众性的党。
    教育方法上，进行这一运动时，可采取集训方式，吸收积极分子也吸收普通群众，吸收大量贫雇，也吸收一部中农，在一块集训，便于发挥群众路线的方法。经过集训，然后再到各村各街中去活动。这里还可采取农民大学方法，一批批一步步，把积极分子层扩大到最大限度。经过集训，可开贫雇农会，农民一家会、妇女会、一直到全体农民大会。冬学是主要活动场所，在冬学内、冬学外分班分组自由活动，打破以往冬学教育方式，采取广大的群众路线方式。
    教育的精神，主要是发扬翻身运动中群众英勇气概，从对比教育中，克服历史上遗留的不良思想。不可单纯回忆历史上凄惨生活，不可单纯强调反省，应主要采取讨论说故事的方法。总之要使这一自觉运动充满了生动活泼愉快雄壮的情绪。
    思想教育内容
    教育内容上有下面几点：土地与劳动思想：叫群众明确谁是土地的主人翁，使群众明确劳动人民是正统，劳动翻身、劳动发家、劳动高尚、寄生最可耻。阶级思想：使农民明确贫雇农今昔地位，农民是一家，农民革命胜利与前途，农民与共产党的关系。武装思想：树立农民武装保卫翻身胜利，保卫土地，保卫解放区，保卫祖国的思想。因此提出优秀分子要参加民兵自卫队，关心民兵，审查民兵，参加军队，支援军队，爱护军队及其家属，启发群众优军与照顾地主出身的军属，并结合实际活动检查优抗，表扬模范，订自卫锄奸联防条约。解放妇女与爱护青年思想：叫广大群众了解妇女在参战翻身运动中的贡献，在生产中的广大作用。教育妇女既建立家务，又要适当参加社会活动。扫除轻视妇女虐待妇女的封建思想。教育大家认识青少年在土地改革中的贡献，要爱护他们；教育青少年学习成年人，尊重成年人，从思想上团结上培养发动大批革命后备。
    工人与农民有矛盾的地方，应吸收工人参加这一运动。或经过工会农会各自动员，然后召开工农团结大会，或从集训到村中活动都吸收工人参加。着重教育会员、尤其贫雇农，让他们了解农民是工人的前身，今后还要大大发展工业，吸收农民参加作工，并了解手工业对农民中的重要。同时要加强组织工人，教育工人，让工人到农民中一块学习，一块讨论，不要陷于孤立。解决矛盾，要从思想运动上来解决，政府在勤务等法令上，也应加以调剂。
    这个运动同时也是生产动员大会。在这段自觉团结运动中，要照顾妇女纺织及春季农民生产时间，运动时间不可太长，在运动末尾，应开一次劳动人民团结大会，动员群众组织起来，订按家计划。并动员干部积极分子在生产运动中起模范作用，并在生产运动中帮助发现培养新英雄。
    群众组织建设
    关于组织建设问题，雪峰同志谈到：在深入运动后期与思想教育中，要大大发展各种组织。在广大民主生活基础上，并照顾群众生产时间，要建立各种组织的生动的生活。这种组织生活活动要和冬学相结合，不要拘一定形式。组织的任务在于组织群众生活活动，不是约束群众。只有这样才能提高各种组织的威信和实际团结群众的活动能力。这才是从组织上巩固团结群众的胜利。组织的活动，应适应于群众的生活，应采取多样形式。基本组织不可过多，形式上不要过于严密，村级领导组织应简单，而在每个群众运动中，应采取多种多样的形式。
    在报告结语中，雪峰同志指出各地都要贯彻一元化领导，整饬纪律，在于统一使用力量，开展工作。同时提倡立功运动，表扬英雄，提倡用脑，发挥干部的创造性。领导上要用干部经验教育干部，特别要从思想方法上，领导方法上，去提高干部，同时也提高自己。
