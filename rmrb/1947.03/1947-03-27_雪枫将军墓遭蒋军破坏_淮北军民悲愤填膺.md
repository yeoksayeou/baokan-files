    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th: The tomb of the late General Peng Xuefeng, former commander of the 4th Division of the New Fourth Army, who dedicated twenty years to the cause of national democratic revolution, and led the people and soldiers of Huaibei in eight years of bloody war against Japan, and gloriously martyred in September 1944, was completely destroyed by the Chiang troops who occupied Yongcheng (Xuefeng County). General Peng's coffin was dragged out of the tomb by Chiang's troops, and his remains were abandoned in the water; they were secretly salvaged and buried by the local people. When the Huaihai People's Guerrilla Forces recovered Xuefeng County on February 3, they re-coffined him and properly buried him in a certain location. General Peng's tomb was originally a cement structure, four feet high, with a bronze statue of General Peng on the front and a biography of the General engraved on the back. It was located in the Martyrs' Cemetery in the west of Xuefeng County. After the Chiang troops occupied the area, they cut down all the trees in the cemetery, completely destroyed the tomb base, and used General Peng's bronze statue as a target for live ammunition shooting practice. The monument to the thousands of anti-Japanese martyrs of the former 4th Division and the Huaihai Military Region was also smashed. The people and soldiers of Huaibei are filled with grief and indignation at this, and vow to resolutely fight to drive out the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to comfort the spirit of General Peng and the anti-Japanese martyrs.

    雪枫将军墓遭蒋军破坏
    淮北军民悲愤填膺
    【新华社华中二十五日电】献身民族民主革命事业二十年，并领导淮北军民八年流血抗日战争，于一九四四年九月光荣殉国的前新四军第四师彭故师长雪枫将军之灵墓，横遭侵占永城（雪枫县）之蒋军破坏无遗。彭将军灵柩被蒋军从墓穴拖出，遗骸弃于水中；由当地人民秘密捞起掩埋。淮北人民游击部队于二月三日收复雪枫县时，始将其重新入殓，妥葬某地。彭故师长墓原系水泥筑构，四尺高，正面为彭将军铜像，背面刻有将军传略，安葬于雪枫县西烈士陵园，蒋军侵占该地后将陵园树木伐光，墓基全部破坏，并以彭师长铜像作为实弹射击枪靶。原四师及淮北军区数千抗日牺牲烈士纪念碑亦被粉碎，淮北军民对此莫不悲愤填膺，誓以坚决战斗赶走卖国贼蒋介石，以慰彭师长及抗日烈士英灵。
