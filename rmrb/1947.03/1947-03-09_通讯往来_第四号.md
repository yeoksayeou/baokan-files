　　Communication and Contact

    No. 4
    To the correspondents of the small newspapers in Linzhang, Handan, and Chengci who have turned over:
    Since the work teams left your counties, what is the current situation of the spring transport? What problems have been left over after the period of great development? How are you carrying out in-depth inspections and implementing the "fill the gaps and make up the deficiencies" campaign? We hope you will seize upon typical areas for reporting, we eagerly await your news.

    To the comrades of the Offices in Neiqiu, Shahe, and Lincheng in the First Military Sub-district:
    Since receiving your summary materials from December, there have been very few reports on the progress of the in-depth movement in your counties. Please provide a systematic introduction to the process of carrying out the investigation movement, ideological education, tackling the backward, and striving for a balanced movement in various places; specifically reflect on the various experiences in the in-depth movement. We hope you will seize upon the cadre summaries and the meetings of the turned-over heroes, and organize and send in various typical materials.

    To the comrades of the Ping'an Office: Please continue to report on your county's method of distributing fruits equally based on output standards. We hope you will conduct in-depth investigations into whether village cadres and large tenants over-distributed fruits exceeding the average output during the rent reduction period; and make a typical continuous report on the specific process by which you adjusted the fruits to achieve an average and reasonable land distribution.

    To all correspondents: Currently, the frontline troops are sending "Merit Citation Forms" to the family members of commanders and soldiers who have performed meritorious services for the people. We hope that you will use news sketches and other forms to report on the situation after the "Merit Citation Forms" are sent to the villages and the situation after the soldiers' families receive them; this will greatly encourage the frontline commanders and soldiers and is the best way to support the frontline work.

　　通讯往来
    第四号
    临漳、邯郸、成磁翻身小报社通讯员：
    自翻身队离你县后，目前春运进行情况如何？在大发展阶段后遗留什么问题？你们怎样开展深入检查，贯彻填平补齐运动？希抓住典型地区报道急盼。
    一分区内邱、沙河、临城办公室诸同志：
    自接你们十二月总结材料后，你县深入运动情形很少报导。请即将各地开展查出运动、思想教育、突击落后、争取平衡运动过程作系统的介绍；具体反映深入运动中各种经验。希抓紧干部总结与翻身英雄会，整理各项典型材料寄来。
    平顺办公室同志：请将你县按产量为标准平均分配果实办法继续报导。希深入调查村干部大佃户减租时期有无多分果实超过平均产量情形；把你们如何调整果实达到平均合理分配土地的具体过程，作典型连续报导。
    各地通讯员同志：现前线各部队纷纷给为人民立功的指战员家属寄发“报功单”，希望以通讯速写等形式把“报功单”寄到村里后的情形和战士家属接到后的情形加以报导；这对前线指战员的鼓舞作用很大，是最好的支援前线工作。
