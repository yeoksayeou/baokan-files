　　Feicheng Breaks Free from Old Experiences and Boldly Carries Out Land Reform
　　[Report from this newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 1st] The main reason why land reform was not thorough in various districts of Feicheng in the past was examined: cadres had the idea of being afraid to move and make mistakes, restricting themselves to the circle of settling accounts and pouring out grievances, so the new spirit of land reform was never conveyed to the masses. This created the problem of "the superiors are afraid and the subordinates don't move." After renewed discussions, various districts universally launched propaganda, proposing to support the masses in settling accounts, and proposing: "Land reform is a reasonable and legal demand of the peasants." On the 1st and 2nd of last month, villagers elected representatives, totaling more than 10,000 people, gathered by district to study the "major event of land returning home." At the meetings in various districts, a movement to find the roots of poverty and the roots of wealth was launched. Land Reform Committees have now been established in all villages. In addition to paying attention to cultivating new activists, special emphasis is placed on the unity of new and old activists.
　　[Report from this newspaper, Nanwang] The work in the Fifth District of Nanwang was weak in the past. Last autumn, the masses were deceived and threatened by bandits and special agents, and a Red Spear Society was organized. Immediately afterwards, Chiang's troops invaded, and the masses in the district fell into dire straits. It was not until a month ago that our army recovered it. On the 4th of this month, a mass meeting of more than 2,000 people was held in the whole district to celebrate the victory and announce the implementation of land reform. The Nanwang County Chief came to speak in person and openly reviewed the various reasons why the work had not been deepened in the past. The masses were extremely moved, and the cadres' confidence was unprecedentedly enhanced. Director Xu of the Federation said: "In the past, it was thought that the masses here were backward and the people were fierce. Being in this place was like being in a tiger's den, extremely dangerous. Now we have finally found the way."

　　肥城打破旧经验束缚
    放手进行土地改革
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】肥城各区检讨过去土地改革不彻底的主要原因：是干部存在不敢动怕出错的思想，限制在清算诉苦的圈子里，所以土地改革的新精神始终没有传达到群众中去。产生了“上怕下不动”的毛病。经重新讨论后，各区普遍开展宣传，提出给群众撑腰清算，提出：“土地改革是农民合理合法的要求。”上月一、二两日各村农民选出代表。总计约万余人，分区集合，研究“土地还家大事”。在各区的会议上，均开展了找穷根、找富根的诉苦运动。现各村均已成立土地改革委员会，除注意培养新的积极分子外，并特别强调提出新旧积极分子的团结问题。
    【本报南旺讯】南旺五区过去工作薄弱，去秋群众受土匪特务欺骗威胁，曾发生红枪会组织，随即蒋军进犯，该区群众陷入水深火热苦境，直至月前始为我军收复，本月四日举行全区二千余人群众大会庆祝胜利，并宣布进行土地改革，南旺县长亲临讲话，公开检讨过去工作未能深入的种种原因群众极为感动，干部信心空前增强，联合会徐主任说：“过去认为这里群众落后，民性强悍，在此地就像置身虎窟，危险异常，现在才找着门路了。”
