    Taihang District Party Committee Personally Conducts In-Depth Investigation
    Soon to Summarize Land Reform Experience
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch on the 27th] In order to deeply understand the land reform situation in various sub-districts, summarize experience, and provide specific guidance, Comrades Li Xuefeng, Wang Weigang, Lai Ruoyu, Leng Chu, and others from the Taihang District Party Committee personally went to various sub-districts after the December [November - translator] district committee meeting, for about two months. They have now returned separately and are rushing to report and study issues. It has been decided to issue instructions on the current key issues. Wei Xiaoquan, Peng Gan, and nine other comrades from the Research Office and Office of the District Party Committee also went to seven counties, including Wuxiang, Licheng, Changzhi, Heshun, Wu'an, Xingtai, and Yuci, after the Heroes' Congress to conduct typical investigations on land reform. They began reporting on the 17th, which has now been completed. Starting on the 24th, comrades from the research offices and offices of various sub-districts, as well as comrades from Wu'an, Ci County, She County, and other places, will report on typical investigations. Reports will be given on approximately one hundred typical villages. After the reports, the areas will be divided into old areas, new areas (each further divided into advanced, backward, and general), new and old areas, and border areas, forming eight research groups (the Xingtai city issue will be studied separately). Efforts will be made to make a preliminary summary of the extent, problems, and experience of land reform in the Taihang District by April 10th. Then, the District Party Committee will draw conclusions based on this preliminary conclusion and personal inspections. This is a comprehensive investigation, study and summary of the period since the Taihang District's previous anti-traitor liquidation, rent reduction and interest rate reduction, to the implementation of "land to the tiller." It is of great significance for correctly evaluating past achievements, promoting experience, and especially for guiding future land reform in border areas and newly recovered areas.

    【本报太行二十七日电】为深入了解各分区土地改革情况，总结经验，并进行具体指导，太行区党委李雪峰，王维纲，赖若愚，冷楚等同志，于去年十一月地委会议后，即先后亲赴各分区，约两月之久，现已分途返回，连日赶作汇报、研究问题，并决定就当前切要问题即发指示。区党委研究室、办公室魏效泉，彭淦等九同志，亦于群英大会后，分赴武乡、黎城、长治、和顺、武安、邢台、榆次等七个县作土地改革的典型调查。并于十七日开始汇报，现已完毕。从二十四日开始，由各分区研究室，办公室及武安、磁县、涉县等地同志作典型调查汇报。汇报典型村庄共约百余个。汇报后，将划分老区、新区（又各分先进、落后、一般）新老区，边地四种地区八个小组研究（邢台市问题另作研究），争取于四月十日前，将太行区土地改革的程度、问题、经验，作出初步总结。然后，区党委根据此初步结论及亲自考察，再作出结论。此系太行区前年以来从反奸清算，减租减息到实行耕者有其田的总的调查研究和总结，对于正确估计过去成绩，发扬经验，特别对指导今后边地及新恢复区土地改革，有极重大意义。
