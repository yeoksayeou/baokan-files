Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 2nd: A person in charge of the CCP Central Committee commented on Chiang Kai-shek's forcing the CCP representatives and staff stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing to withdraw, stating: Chiang Kai-shek's garrison commands in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing notified the CCP representatives currently stationed in the aforementioned three locations, Dong Biwu, Wu Yuzhang, and their staff and families, on February 27th and 28th, respectively, that they must all withdraw before March 5th. They have also forcibly shut down the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, closely monitored and forcibly concentrated the CCP personnel in the aforementioned areas. Whether this absurd measure by Chiang Kai-shek is based on his own orders or the reckless actions of his local authorities, it indicates that Chiang Kai-shek's side has decided to finally break down and fight it out, closing the door to all negotiations. Since February of last year, Chiang Kai-shek has consistently broken his promises and violated the ceasefire orders and resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference countless times. For the sake of the motherland's independence, peace, and democracy, the Chinese Communist Party has always been accommodating and has done its utmost in the various negotiations. Even after Chiang Kai-shek brazenly disregarded everything, convening a bogus National Assembly to create a bogus constitution while launching an offensive against Yan'an, the CCP was still willing to continue negotiations on the two minimum conditions of restoring the military positions of January 13th of last year and abolishing the bogus constitution and restoring the Political Consultative Conference line, using peaceful methods to resolve all major domestic issues. However, Chiang Kai-shek stubbornly rejected the most reasonable and minimal demands put forward by the CCP. After facing serious crises in his own military, political, and economic aspects recently, he actually took this step, forcing all representatives and staff of the CCP in various places who were responsible for negotiation and liaison work to withdraw within a limited time, finally closing the door to all peace negotiations, and attempting to carry out the civil war to the end, realizing his conspiracy to eliminate the CCP and the democratic forces of the whole country by force. As for the Chiang Kai-shek's police and secret service organs' claims that the CCP personnel were "inciting disturbances, organizing riots," and "spreading rumors and inciting unrest," these are shameless slanders and intimidation tactics of Chiang Kai-shek's police, secret service, and special agents, attempting to create a pretext for creating great terror against CCP personnel and all democrats in major cities. Their order for CCP personnel to complete the withdrawal so urgently before March 5th is obviously absolutely impossible to achieve; their purpose is to arrest and persecute CCP personnel under the pretext of "no responsibility for protection" when they cannot withdraw by the deadline. We have pointed out this conspiracy of arrest and persecution long ago, and now is the time for them to implement this conspiracy. Chiang Kai-shek's police and secret service organs have now concentrated CCP personnel in Chongqing and Shanghai, in a state akin to imprisonment, with no freedom even to enter or leave the gates, which is a prelude to arrest and persecution. The person in charge concluded by saying: If Chiang Kai-shek does not immediately change and abandon this absurd step, then he is truly heading towards a dead end, and he should be responsible for all the consequences!

　　中共中央负责人称
    蒋方决心最后破裂
    迫我驻京沪渝人员三月五日前撤离图在限期不能撤退时加以逮捕迫害
    【新华社延安二日电】中共中央负责人评论蒋方迫使中共驻京沪渝代表及工作人员撤离事称：蒋介石在京沪渝的卫戍警备机关于二月二十七日和二十八日分别通知现留在上述三处的中共代表董必武、吴玉章和工作人员及眷属，限于三月五日前全部撤退，并已强迫停闭重庆新华日报，严密监视和强迫集中上述各地的中共人员。蒋方这一荒谬措施，无论是出于蒋介石本人的命令或是其地方当局的胡作非为，都是表示蒋方已经决心最后破裂放手大打下去，关死一切谈判之门。从去年二月以来，蒋介石一贯背信弃义，无数次地破坏停战令与政协各项决议。中国共产党为了祖国的独立、和平、民主始终委曲求全，在历次谈判中做到仁至义尽。甚至当蒋介石已经悍然不顾一切一面召开伪国大制成伪宪法，一面发动向延安的攻势之后，中共仍然愿意在恢复去年一月十三日军事位置与取消伪宪、恢复政协路线两个最低限度的条件下继续谈判，用和平方法解决国内一切重大问题。然而，蒋介石却横蛮地拒绝中共所提出的最合理的与最低限度的起码要求，在其自己的军事、政治、经济各方面近来遭逢严重的危机之后，竟然出此一着，强迫中共在各地担任谈判联络工作的全部代表与工作人员限期撤退，最后地关死一切和平谈判之门，妄图内战到底，实现其武力消灭中共及全国民主势力的阴谋。至于蒋方宪警机关所说的中共人员“煽动风潮，组织暴动”，“散播谣言，鼓动变乱”云云，乃是蒋介石宪警特务无耻的毁谤、威吓之惯技，企图作为在各大城市对中共人员和一切民主人士造成大恐怖的借口。他们限令中共人员如此急迫地在三月五日以前撤退完毕，这显然是绝对不可能办到的事情；其目的是想在到期不能撤退时，便在“概不负保护责任”的借口下逮捕和迫害中共人员。这种逮捕迫害的阴谋我们早就指出过，现在是他们实施这个阴谋的时候了。蒋介石的宪警特务机关现已将渝沪中共人员集中起来，形同监禁，连进出大门也没有自由，这就是逮捕迫害的先声。该负责人末称：蒋介石这一荒谬步骤如不立即改变和放弃，那真是他自己走到了绝路，一切后果应由他负责！
