　　[Reported from Licheng by this newspaper] During the land reform movement in Licheng, public and private stores and production departments of government organizations also voluntarily donated the wealth they were storing for landlords. When Yumin Village held a meeting to review each person's understanding of the land reform movement and conduct mutual criticism, activist Shen Yuanjiang pointed out that the store's manager, Wang Shangqi, and clerk, Duan Changsen, were shielding each other, hiding things for landlords. After review and education, the two confessed their mistakes to the masses, and were willing to return all the hidden supplies to the masses. Under their influence, more than 20 public and private businesses, including the Xin Sheng Bookstore, Min Jian Store, Li Feng Store, and the Workers' Union Cooperative, reported that they were hiding over 70 items of clothing and bedding, over 80 tables and benches, and silver dollars belonging to landlords.

　　黎城公私商店不作“防空洞”献出地主寄藏物资
    【本报黎城讯】黎城查田运动中，各公私商店、机关生产部门也纷纷自动献出为地主保存之财物。浴民庄开会检讨各人对查田运动之认识进行互相批评时，积极分子申远江提出该号经理王尚奇店员段长森互相包庇，替地主隐藏东西，经检讨教育后，二人向群众坦白认错，愿将全部隐藏物资交还群众。在他们影响下，当晚即有新生书店、民建商店、黎丰商店、工联社等二十余家公私商号报出隐藏地主之衣被七十余件，桌凳八十余件，及银洋等。
