Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 5th: Prague dispatch: The First Council Meeting of the World Democratic Women's League has issued a message to women worldwide on the occasion of the upcoming International Women's Day, stating: 1947 marks the second celebration of this holiday after the victory. In some countries, as long as the breeding grounds of fascism are not eradicated, March 8th must be commemorated as a day of struggle. Women have fought for freedom and peace, and we cannot consider our mission complete until freedom and peace are achieved. Although international reactionaries are attempting to obstruct progress, democratic countries have grown, and democratic forces worldwide are rising. The World Democratic Women's League calls on women worldwide to unite in the struggle to finally eliminate fascist remnants, develop democracy, independence, defend lasting peace, and protect our rights.
