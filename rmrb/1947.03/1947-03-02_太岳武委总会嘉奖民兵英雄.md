Taiyue, 28th—The Taiyue Military Commission General Association issued a circular on the 19th, commending the militia combat teams of hero model counties, districts, and villages in the entire area for their achievements in killing enemies in 1946, and awarding them banners and certificates. These included Xue Pinghua, a combat hero from Dubalian, Jiyuan, who organized the villages of Liuzhuang, Lianchi, and four others into a joint defense. He used thorn bushes and landmines to build a ten-mile-long explosive defense line, cleared the fields, buried landmines in every house, and organized evacuations. In every battle, men, women, old, and young all took part. Over the year, they shattered more than 30 attacks by Chiang’s puppets. They fought 190 battles throughout the year, killing or wounding 99 enemies, capturing 30, and seizing five rifles and one pistol. He also led the Dubalian peasants to turn themselves over and completed land reform amidst the artillery fire, creating a typical example for the entire region. In addition to Xue Pinghua's individual award, Dubalian received a banner reading "Protect the fields, protect the home, win every battle." Zhang Yin, an explosion hero from Huo County, led the militia in the Yindi war zone to carry out an explosion campaign and created explosive tactics such as the "Mud God Scolding Array." Throughout the year, they fought 90 battles, killing or wounding 80 enemies below the rank of battalion commander, capturing 11 below the rank of platoon leader, and seizing 13 rifles and two machine guns. The Military Commission General awarded a banner reading "Joint Defense and Explosion, Able to Attack and Defend." The Mashanshang combat team in Zhao City created an astonishing ambush battle at Shitancun, annihilating 47 enemies in three minutes. They won a banner reading "Bravely Engage the Enemy, Win by Surprise." Furthermore, Han Jinhu, an old hero from the county, though in his sixties, also heroically swore in the campaign to kill enemies and perform meritorious service, "I will kill two enemies to defend Chairman Mao." As expected, he succeeded and killed two enemies. The Military Commission General awarded him five cans of milk and fifty eggs. Other awarded militia combat heroes included Pei Defu, Yin Xi, and Wu Yong, explosion heroes from Pingyao; Liu Fugen from Lingshi, who created the "Eagle Catches Chicken" tactic; Zhao Tu'er from Yuanqu, who led the anti-liquidation struggle; Ren Keliang, a hero in the "Grid Network" from Xia County; Li Yinbao (Yemingzhu), a long-march hero from Yangcheng; Shang Qingfu, a flying explosion expert from Hongdong; Hongsongdong, Huo County; Wu Jinzhong, Li Ying, and Qiao Lilong, explosion heroes; Hou Wenqing, a hero from Xinjiang, who used camouflage tactics; Luo Laifu, a six-shooter from Jiexiu; Li Dechang, a long-march explosion expert from Qinyuan; Ren Mingrui, who created the scarecrow explosion, and Jin Suirong, among 25 others, each receiving a medal and 2,000 Jicha banknotes. In the campaign to kill enemies and perform meritorious service in December of last year, Pingyao, Huo County, Jiyuan, Lingshi, Xia County, Yuanqu, and Jiexiu, which had killed over 100 enemies, and the Second District of Lingshi, which had a record of annihilating 104 enemies, each won a banner reading "Defend Chairman Mao, Meritorious in Killing the Enemy." The Zhunwang joint defense in the First District of Fushan and the Jilu Militia Combat Team, the Meng County Militia Combat Team, the Gao Huida Combat Team, and Xinxing Village in Yuanqu each won a banner and a certificate.
