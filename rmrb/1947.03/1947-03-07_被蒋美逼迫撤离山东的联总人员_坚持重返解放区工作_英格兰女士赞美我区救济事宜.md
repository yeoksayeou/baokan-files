Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 5th: Earlier this month, Chiang Kai-shek's planes deliberately bombed and strafed ships carrying UNRRA relief supplies to the Shandong Liberated Area and the areas where UNRRA personnel were working, attempting to cut off the transportation of UNRRA relief supplies to the Liberated Area and intimidate UNRRA personnel into withdrawing from the Liberated Area. However, according to an article in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on February 28th entitled "A Visit with UNRRA's Miss England": The vast majority of UNRRA staff members who were recalled to Shanghai, disregarding any intimidation, insisted on returning to work in the Shandong Liberated Area within days. Why are they disregarding everything and insisting on returning to work in the Shandong Liberated Area? Miss England, a former founder of the Peiping Union Nursing School, president of the University of Washington Nursing School, and in her fifties, replied to the Wenhui Daily reporter's inquiry: "The people there are genuinely trying to create happiness for the common people, and I am willing to contribute to the Chinese people, so I am willing to go to the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists to help them work whenever I have the opportunity." She went on to describe what she saw and heard in Zhangjiakou in the spring of 1946, she found that the relief work there was so organized and so efficient that she was very satisfied. She said: "I went to inspect the distribution of milk powder, and I found that UNRRA in that area was truly and fairly distributing it to the orphans in urgent need, and everything was carried out according to the planned schedule, quickly and efficiently." She said: "I found that the people there are at least not as miserable as they are here (referring to the KMT-controlled areas). They are warmly dressed, well-fed, and the children all have rosy cheeks. The people have already had good times. During the few days we were there, we didn't see a single beggar. The people's lives there are truly happy." She praised the medical relief and treatment work in the Shandong Liberated Area, saying: "They are doing such a good job, and in the harsh environment of almost no equipment, they are doing sacred and responsible work." In Miss England's conversation, there was a sincere admiration. It is this situation that moves them, so that they are not afraid of hardship and want to return to the Shandong Liberated Area to work, and also makes this Miss England, who is over fifty years old, want to return to the Shandong Liberated Area to continue to serve as the director of the nursing training class.

　　被蒋美逼迫撤离山东的联总人员
    坚持重返解放区工作
    英格兰女士赞美我区救济事宜
    【新华社延安五日电】上月初，蒋介石飞机故意轰炸扫射载运联总救济品赴山东解放区的船只和联总人员工作的地区，企图断绝联总救济品对解放区的运输，并恫吓联总人员使其从解放区撤退。但据上月二十八日沪文汇报《联总英格兰女士访问记》一文称：被召回上海的联总工作人员，绝大多数不顾任何恫吓，坚持日内重返山东解放区工作。为什么他们不顾一切坚持重返山东解放区工作呢？前北平协和护士学校创办人、华盛顿大学护士学校校长五十多岁的联总英格兰女士答复文汇报记者询问时说：“那边的人是真心要为老百姓谋幸福的，我也愿为中国的老百姓出力，所以一有机会我便愿意到中共的地区中去帮助他们工作”。他继述一九四六年春天她在张家口的见闻，她发现那边的救济工作进行的那么有组织，那么有效率，使她非常满意。她说：“我是去视察奶粉的分派情形的，我发觉解总在那地区中是真正公平地分派到有迫切需要的孤子们手中，一切都依着早就拟好的计划进行，迅速而有效率”。她说：“我发现那边的老百姓至少没有这里苦（指蒋管区），他们衣穿得暖，饭吃得饱，孩子们全有红润的面颊，老百姓已有好时光过了。我们在那边的几天，便看不到一个乞丐，那边人民的生活是真正快乐的”。她对于山东解放区的医药救济治疗工作甚为称赞，她说：“他们的工作做得太好了，在几乎一无设备的艰苦环境中，他们正做着神圣负责的工作”。在英格兰女士的谈话中，流露着衷心的赞美。是这种情形感动着他们，使他们不畏艰苦的要重返山东解放区工作，也使这位五十余高龄的英格兰女士要回到山东解放区继续担任护士训练班主任的工作。
