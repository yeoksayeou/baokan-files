　　Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference
    The world-renowned Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference has opened. The main topics of this foreign ministers' conference are the German and Austrian issues. The drafting of the Austrian treaty has been carried out to a considerable extent by the four foreign ministers' assistants, while the German treaty has not yet been drafted. It is expected that the Austrian treaty will be adopted at this foreign ministers' conference, and the main contents of the German treaty will be discussed and outlined.
    Before the foreign ministers' conference opened, the British and American, especially the American, reactionaries released "pessimistic" arguments, saying that this foreign ministers' conference would not achieve anything. U.S. President Truman announced that he would send his Secretary of State Marshall to Moscow with a "big stick." The reactionaries pretended to be aggressive, as if they had the ability to make this conference fail to achieve anything. In fact, no reactionary, whether British or American, has the power to make this foreign ministers' conference fail to achieve anything. Their pretentious shouting is just a manifestation of outward strength but inward weakness, and its role is only to scare others, making others think that these reactionaries still have the ability to influence international politics, and although they cannot do good things, they still have the ability to do bad things, so they can be forced to submit to them. In fact, these reactionaries have never been so outwardly strong but inwardly weak as they are today. The international reactionaries are so desperate that they have to give up the good things that can obviously win the sympathy of the whole world to the Soviet Union, and let the Soviet Union say the good words, while they are nakedly playing the role of hooligans on the international political stage, talking about "pessimism" and "big sticks"!
    Not only that, but who in the world is afraid of their "big sticks"? At most, this kind of "big stick" is as "scary" as Churchill's "British-American anti-Soviet army" in his speech last March. Churchill's reactionary speech did not scare people, on the contrary, Churchill himself became completely isolated because of it. Replacing the "British-American anti-Soviet army" with a "big stick," what good results will Truman get?
    The crux of the international situation must ultimately be found in the economic aspect. Economically, the Soviet Union will never have an economic crisis; the economic crisis in the United States is already imminent, and Britain has already begun to be in crisis due to the coal shortage. There are two ways for Britain to solve the economic crisis. One way is to launch a world war like Hitler, which is impossible for Britain. The other way cannot but be to solve the European problem, stabilize the European economy, reform domestic affairs, let the colonies be independent, be friendly with the Soviet Union, and resist American aggression. As long as the first method does not work, Britain will have no choice but to gradually adopt the second method, even if it is unwilling. Many recent political events in Britain, such as the agreement to revise the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty, such as the struggle with the United States over the Palestine issue, all indicate this situation. Britain is a country that has already experienced an economic crisis, and the solution of the German and Austrian issues is very urgent in terms of Britain's economic needs. Among the three countries of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, Britain is the first country that urgently needs to solve the German and Austrian issues quickly in terms of economic interests.
    Although the United States is aggressive, it must also demand a solution to the German and Austrian issues for its own economic interests. The more imminent the U.S. economic crisis becomes, the more urgent its demand to solve these problems will be. However, although the U.S. economic crisis is imminent, it has not yet arrived. Precisely because of this, the American reactionaries still believe that they have an opportunity to struggle, and want to thoroughly disrupt this foreign ministers' conference. This kind of disruption, due to the imminence of the U.S. economic crisis and the arrival of the British economic crisis, is actually the end of its strength. Its method is likely to be to knock as much as possible before the compromise. The situation is already very clear that a third world war is definitely not going to break out now. (Missing hundreds of characters) It is still too early to say that this foreign ministers' conference will have a very satisfactory result, but a satisfactory result will definitely come sooner or later, and all pessimistic arguments are unfounded.
    How this foreign ministers' conference will discuss the China issue has become the object of speculation by all parties. Since the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December of the year before last, the situation in China has changed drastically. After Chiang Kai-shek drove away the liaison personnel of the CCP representatives and closed the door to peace talks, the China issue returned to the same situation as before the December 12th Incident in 1936. Chiang Kai-shek nakedly revealed his fascist nature, and the only way out for the Chinese people is the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, and there is no other way out. Since the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference the year before last, the American imperialist policy of intervention in China and the policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war have been the main reasons for the large-scale death and economic collapse of the Chinese people in the civil war. The hideous face of American imperialism has been exposed to the people of the world for more than a year, and the fascist and traitorous nature of Chiang Kai-shek has also been unprecedentedly exposed. China is still one of the five powers, but Chiang Kai-shek's international status is already equal to Franco of Spain. The degree of American imperialist intervention in China's internal affairs is no different from Hitler's intervention in Spain's internal affairs before, but the form is slightly different, euphemistically called "mediation," helping construction and "relief."
    American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek are very afraid of this four foreign ministers' conference discussing the China issue, because if it is discussed, it will inevitably revisit the resolution of December of the year before last, and thus will condemn the American government and the Chiang Kai-shek government. Therefore, the Chiang Kai-shek government, which cleanly sold China to American imperialism, suddenly became "patriotic" and clamored against the foreign ministers' conference discussing the China issue. In addition to showing the guilty conscience of the U.S. and Chiang, there is nothing else worthy of attention.
    The Chinese people are justified and fully believe that their own strength can defeat Chiang Kai-shek, who has added the assistance of American imperialism, so they welcome any international moral support, but they have no dependent mentality. As for interference like that of U.S. imperialism, we resolutely oppose it to the end! Our belief is that the power of the Chinese people and the people of the world will surely be able to defeat American imperialism and the fascist Chiang Kai-shek, and this day will not be far away.

### 莫斯科外长会议

1947-03-16

专栏：解放日报社论

　　莫斯科外长会议
    举世瞩目的莫斯科四国外长会议已经开幕。此次外长会议的主要议题为德奥问题，对奥和约的起草已由四外长助理们进行到一个相当的段落，而对德和约则尚未起草；预料此次外长会议上将要通过对奥和约，而对于对德和约的主要内容将要商议出一个眉目来。
    在外长会议未开以前，英美的特别是美国的反动派大放“悲观”论调，说这次外长会议决无成就。美国总统杜鲁门宣布要他的国务卿马歇尔带着“大棒”去莫斯科，反动派装得气势汹汹，似乎他们有本领能使此次会议毫无成就似的。实际上，反动派不论是英国的也好，不论是美国的也好，谁也没有力量使此次外长会议毫无成就。他们的装腔作势的叫嚷，只是外强中干的表现，其作用只在吓唬别人，让别人以为这些反动派还有左右国际政治的能力，虽然好事做不出来，但做坏事却还有本领，因而向他们屈服。实际上，这些反动派从来没有像今天这样外强中干，真是越来越脆弱，国际反动派的山穷水尽已到如此地步，以致不得不把那些显然可以取得全世界同情的好事都让给苏联去做，把那些好话都让给苏联去说，而自己却赤裸裸地串着国际政治舞台上流氓痞子的角色，说什么“悲观”，什么“大棒”！
    不但如此而已，世界上有谁怕他们的“大棒”呢？这种“大棒”，充其量像去年三月邱吉尔演说中“英美反苏联军”那样“吓人”吧，邱吉尔的反动演说没有吓坏人，相反的邱吉尔本人因此完全孤立了起来。用“大棒”来代替“英美反苏联军”，试问杜鲁门又会得到什么好结果？
    国际形势的症结，最后还要从经济方面去找。在经济上，苏联是永远不会有什么经济危机的；美国的经济危机却已经迫近地要到来，而英国则已因煤荒而开始处在危机中。对于英国解决经济危机有两个方法，一个方法是索性像希特勒一样发动世界大战，这对于英国是办不到的，另一个方法就不能不是解决欧洲问题，安定欧洲经济，改革内政，让殖民地独立，与苏联友好和对抗美国的侵略。只要第一个方法走不通，英国即使老大不愿意，也没有办法不逐渐地采用第二个方法。最近英国政治上的许多事件，如答应修改英苏同盟条约，如在巴勒斯坦问题上与美国的斗争等等，都表示了这种情况。英国是已经发生了经济危机的国家，德奥问题的解决在英国经济的需要上来说是很急迫的。在英、苏、美三国中，英国在经济利益上是第一个急迫需要迅速解决德奥问题的国家。
    美国尽管气势汹汹，但为了自己的经济利益，也不能不要求解决德奥问题。美国经济危机愈加迫近，其要求解决这些问题也会愈加迫切。但是美国的经济危机虽然迫近却还没有到来，正因为如此，美国的反动派还认为有机会挣扎一下，要在此次外长会议里结实捣乱一下。这种捣乱由于美国经济危机的迫近，和英国经济危机的已经到来，实际上是强弩之末，其手法很可能是想在妥协之前愈多愈好的敲一下竹杠。事情已经很清楚，第三次世界大战在现在是一定打不起来的了。（中缺百余字）现在来说这次外长会议会有很圆满的结果似尚过早，但是圆满的结果迟早一定会有，一切的悲观论都是毫无根据的。
    此次外长会议如何讨论中国问题，成为各方所推求的对象。自从前年十二月莫斯科三国外长会议以来，中国的情形是大变了。蒋介石赶走中共代表联络人员，关死和谈之门以后，中国的问题回到一九三六年双十二事变以前一样，蒋介石赤裸裸的露出了法西斯的本相，中国人民唯一出路就是爱国自卫战争的胜利，除此以外再无别的出路。自前年莫斯科三国外长会议以来，美国对华的帝国主义干涉政策，援蒋内战的政策，乃是使中国人民在内战中大批死亡和经济崩溃的主要原因。美国帝国主义的狰狞面目，一年多来在世界人民面前暴露无遗了，蒋介石的法西斯与卖国贼的本质也是从来未有的暴露无遗了。中国仍是五强之一，但是蒋介石的国际地位已经等于西班牙的佛朗哥，美国帝国主义对于中国内政的干涉，其程度亦与以前希特勒对西班牙内政的干涉无异，不过形式上稍有不同，美其名曰“调处”，帮助建设与“救济”而已。
    美国帝国主义与蒋介石很怕此次四国外长会议讨论中国问题，因为如果讨论起来，就必然会重提前年十二月的决议，因而会谴责美国政府与蒋介石政府。因此把中国干净出卖给美国帝国主义的蒋介石政府忽然“爱国”起来了，大声疾呼反对外长会议讨论中国问题，这除了表示美蒋的做贼心虚外，别无任何值得重视之处。
    中国人民理直气壮，完全相信自己的力量可以战胜加上了美国帝国主义援助的蒋介石，因此对于任何国际上道义的声援都是欢迎的，却并无依赖的心理。对于像美帝国主义那样的干涉，则坚决反对到底！我们的信念是：中国人民与世界人民的力量，必定能够战胜美国帝国主义与法西斯蒋介石，而且这个日子是不会很远了。（三月十二日）
