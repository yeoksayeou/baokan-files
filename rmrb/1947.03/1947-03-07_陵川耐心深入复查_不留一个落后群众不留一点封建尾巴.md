[This dispatch from our newspaper comes from] Taihang, 5th. Lingchuan is currently carrying out the "Double Check" movement (checking for loopholes, checking for remnants). After more than fifty days (from December of last year to February 10th of this year) of large-scale emancipation movement, according to statistics from two districts, farmers recovered more than 25,000 mu of land, more than 6,500 rooms, more than 8,000 dan of grain, more than 500 head of livestock, and more than 800 sheep (other clothing and items not included). Impoverished farmers have generally risen, and middle peasants have also received fruits. In order to thoroughly realize land reform, the county convened cadre and emancipation hero meetings in each district in the middle of last month to summarize experiences, discuss continuing to deepen the movement, and put forward three "musts" for cadres: (1) Must go deep into the masses, carefully examine, and face the "backward" (villages and people); (2) Must patiently solve problems; (3) Must listen to the opinions of the masses, consciously admit mistakes, bravely accept criticism, and unite democratically. Four "no leaving behinds" for emancipation: (1) Leave not a single loophole; (2) Leave not a single remnant; (3) Leave not a single backward person; (4) Leave not a single fruit undistributed. After the meeting, they immediately went their separate ways to carry out in-depth inspections. During the in-depth inspections, the Sixth District discovered that 150 landlords were not thoroughly struggled against. 490 members of the peasant association dared not speak (of which more than 160 were acting as "air-raid shelters"), 70 outstanding problems were left, 240 new problems arose, and cadres in 13 villages were at odds. The Fucheng District found that 88 landlords were not thoroughly struggled against, concealing 56 mu of land, and more than 100 impoverished farmers had not completely turned over. The Chengguan District, under the guideline of supporting the masses, taking charge, and uniting to attack the landlords, first resolved the estrangement between cadres and the masses and raised the awareness of the cadres. For example, Wang Tiehai, the political director of Ping Village, led the masses to struggle against his father-in-law, greatly supporting the backward masses. At present, each village is carrying out resolving the outstanding problems.

　　陵川耐心深入复查
    不留一个落后群众不留一点封建尾巴
    【本报太行五日电】陵川正开展双查运动（查窟窿，查尾巴）。该县经过五十余日（去年十二月至今年二月十日）的大规模翻身运动，据两个区的统计，农民收回土地二万五千余亩，房六千五百余间，粮食八千多石，牲口五百余头，羊八百余只（其他衣物等未计），赤贫农普遍上升，中农亦分得果实。该县为彻底实现土地改革，于上月中旬，各区均先后召开了干部及翻身英雄会，总结经验，讨论继续深入运动，并提出干部三要：（一）要深入群众，细心检查，面向“落后”（村与人）；（二）要耐心解决问题；（三）要倾听群众意见，自觉认错，勇敢接受批评，团结、民主。翻身四不留：（一）不留一个窟窿；（二）不留一点尾巴；（三）不留一个落后群众；（四）不留一点果实不分配。会后即分头进行深入的检查，在深入检查中六区发现一百五十个地主斗的不彻底。农会会员有四百九十人不敢说话（内当“防空洞”者一百六十余人），遗留问题七十件，新问题二百四十件，有十三个村的干部闹不团结。附城区则查出八十八户地主斗的不彻底，隐瞒土地五十六亩，一百余户赤贫农没翻透身。城关区在给群众撑腰作主，团结起来向地主进攻的方针下，首先解决干部与群众的隔阂，提高了干部的觉悟；如平村政治主任王铁海领导群众斗争他的岳父，给落后群众大大撑了腰。现各村正在进行解决遗留问题。
