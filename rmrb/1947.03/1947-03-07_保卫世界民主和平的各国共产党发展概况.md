　　Overview of the Development of Communist Parties in Various Countries Defending World Democratic Peace
　　War educated the people, and the people will win the war, win peace, and win progress. This is the law of the current new world situation.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Mao Zedong
　　In the anti-fascist war, the communists of all countries stood at the forefront of the struggle, uniting and leading the people to victory. After the war, they were the firm defenders of world peace and democracy, leading the people in a resolute struggle against fascist remnants and anti-democratic forces. Therefore, the communists of each country are sincerely loved and actively supported by the people of their respective countries, who elect them to the government or parliament as their most trusted representatives. Due to the unprecedented increase in the awareness of the people of the world, the strength of the communist parties in various countries has developed rapidly, pushing the post-war world forward. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet Union defeated the German invaders, rescued all of humanity, and became even more powerful. Its international status has greatly increased. The All-Union Communist Party has more than six million members and has become the central fortress for defending world peace and democracy. After leading the Chinese people through eight years of arduous struggle to defeat the Japanese invaders, the Chinese Communist Party has grown unprecedentedly, with its membership increasing to 2.2 million. It has become the central force for the Chinese people to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, civil war, and dictatorship, and to uphold independence, peace, and democracy. In addition, communist parties in 20 countries around the world are holding important positions in their governments, whereas before the war, no communist parties had ever participated in these governments.
　　In Europe, the governments of sixteen countries, including France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Iceland, Austria, Spain (note: referring to the democratic Spanish government now in Mexico, not the Franco government), and Germany, are either organized by the Communist Party or have the Communist Party participating. Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania are the four countries whose governments are led and organized by the Communist Party. In Yugoslavia, the famous Marshal Tito serves as Prime Minister, and the Deputy Prime Minister is also a communist, Kardelj. In Bulgaria's general election last October, the Bulgarian Communist Party achieved a major victory, winning 277 seats out of 465 in the new parliament. Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov formed a new government. There are currently 400,000 members, averaging one communist for every seventeen people. In Czechoslovakia's general election last May, the Czech Communist Party rose to become the largest party in the country, with twice as many votes in parliament as the second party, the National Socialist Party. The Czech Communist Party was responsible for forming a democratic coalition government, with Czech Communist leader Klement Gottwald serving as Prime Minister. The Czech Communist Party holds nine of the twenty-six cabinet seats. It has 1.3 million members (including Slovakia), averaging one communist for every eight people. The Chairman of the Albanian People's Government is Communist General Enver Hoxha, a founding father of Albania, commander of the 80,000-strong Albanian National Liberation Army, and Chairman of the Albanian People's Front.
　　The Communist Party of Poland is also called the Workers' Party. The Deputy Prime Minister of the unified national government is the Workers' Party member, Geder. The Polish Workers' Party has 310,000 members.
　　In Romania, Hungary, and Finland, former German satellite states, the Communist Party suffered brutal repression for its anti-fascist activities, but with the enthusiastic support of the people, it struggled steadfastly and finally rescued their countries from German control. After the war, they all held important positions in the government. In the Romanian coalition government, the Communist Party, the Peasant Party, and the Social Democratic Party each held three ministerial seats. In the parliamentary elections last November, the democratic party bloc won an overwhelming victory, occupying 348 of the 414 seats in the new parliament. The General Confederation of Labor under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party has 1.5 million members. The Hungarian Communist Party held four ministerial seats in the coalition government, occupied 20% of the seats in parliament, and had 160,000 members. Before the war, the Finnish Communist Party could not operate openly and suffered greatly from repression. However, it leads the powerful Finnish people's organization, the "Finnish People's Democratic League," and jointly forms a government with the Finnish Social Democratic Party and the Agrarian League, holding important positions such as Minister of the Interior. In 1939, the Finnish Communist Party had only 2,000 members and no representatives in parliament. By last June, its membership had increased to 28,000, with 49 members in parliament (one-quarter of the total), and the party newspaper sold 150,000 copies daily.
　　Another country that withdrew from the Axis powers halfway was Italy. When resisting the Germans, the Italian Communist Party organized 250,000 guerrillas in northern Italy. Mussolini was captured and shot by Italian Communist guerrillas. After Italy joined the Allied forces, that government could not do without the Italian Communist Party. Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti served as Minister of Justice and Deputy Prime Minister. In the general election last June, although reactionary forces at home and abroad concentrated their efforts to attack the Italian Communist Party, it still won 105 seats. Together with its allied party, the Socialist Party, it was the alliance with the most seats in parliament. In February last year, it had 1.8 million members, which increased to 2.16 million by October. At the end of the year, in the municipal elections in six major cities including Rome, the Communist Party had overwhelmed the Christian Democratic Party (the leading party in the June general election, led by the current Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi).
　　In Western Europe, Northern European countries that had been occupied by Germany – France, Belgium, Norway – and Central and Southern European Austria, the communist parties of each country also held important positions in the government, and the communist party of the small Nordic country of Iceland had also joined the government. The French Communist Party was the third largest party before the war, and in the October 1945 election, the French Communist Party jumped to become the leading party. In the June general election last year, due to the joint attack by reactionary parties at home and abroad, the French Communist Party retreated to the second largest party, but with only one less seat than the previous election, still holding 150 seats. In Bidault's cabinet, the French Communist Party held seven seats, with Thorez as Vice President. In the November election, the French Communist Party once again won the position of leading party in parliament, winning 168 seats in the National Assembly. In the French government, the French Communist Party holds five ministerial positions, including the Ministry of Defense, with Thorez as Deputy Prime Minister. Before the war, the French Communist Party had only 40,000 members, which increased to 1.2 million by last May, more than the total number of members of all other French parties combined. The party newspaper sells more than 2 million copies daily. Thirty of the forty French industrial trade unions are under the leadership of the French Communist Party. The Belgian Communist Party had only 10,000 members in 1939, with nine members in parliament, and the party newspaper sold 10,000 copies. By last June, its membership had increased to 100,000, with 20 members of the House of Representatives and 11 senators in Congress, occupying 58 seats in the provincial assemblies, ranking first in industrial cities such as Liège. The party newspaper sells 110,000 copies daily. There are four cabinet members in the current government, and in November, Belgian Communist Party Chairman Julien Lahaut was elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Norwegian Communist Party had only over 3,000 members in 1939, with no representatives in parliament, which increased to 33,000 by last June, with 13 members of parliament, and the party newspaper sells 50,000 copies. There are two cabinet members in the current government. In Austria, the Austrian Communist Party and the Socialist Party formed an alliance. In the cabinet, the Austrian Communist Party holds one seat and the Socialist Party holds five seats. In parliament, the two parties jointly hold 76 seats. The Austrian Communist Party had only 8,000 members in 1933, which increased to 130,000 by last June, and the party newspaper sells 450,000 copies. The Icelandic Communist Party has joined the government. The Icelandic Communist Party had 600 members in 1939, which increased to 1,100 by last June, and the party newspaper publishes 4,000 copies.
　　In Germany, although the Communist Party's activities are still suppressed in the British and American occupied zones, the German Communist Party already has 670,000 members and plans to expand to 1 million in the shortest possible time. If we look back to the pre-war period when there were only 350,000, we can see that it has developed rapidly. In the Soviet-occupied zone, the German Communist Party has participated in the work of local governments. Last February, the German Communist Party and the Socialist Party (with over 1 million members) merged to form the Unified Socialist Party, becoming the largest party in Germany. Recently, it has also taken unified action with the Communist Parties in the American and British occupied zones to jointly form a Central Executive Committee.
　　The Spanish Communist Party was a powerful party during the People's Front era in 1936. After the defeat of the Republican Army, the Spanish Communist Party still has 25,000 members persisting in the anti-Franco struggle at home. Last April, the Spanish Communist Party sent a representative to participate in the Giral Republican government in exile in Mexico.
　　The communist parties of the above sixteen countries are resolutely implementing the land reform policy of "land to the tiller" and guaranteeing labor welfare. For example, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany have either completed the land reform of "land to the tiller" or are vigorously carrying it out, giving the broad masses of working people the opportunity to stand up. (⑶⑷)
　　In Asia, there are also three countries where the Communist Party has organized or participated in the government. The Chairman of the government of the Republic of Vietnam is the leader of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Ho Chi Minh. The People's Government under his leadership is composed of the Vietnam Independence League, the Democratic Party, the Revolutionary League, and non-party figures led by the Vietnamese Communist Party. During the Anti-Japanese War, the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party had 500,000 people. Although the Korean Communist Party is still oppressed in the American-occupied zone and the Central Committee of the Korean Communist Party has been unreasonably arrested, in North Korea occupied by the Soviet Union, the Korean Communist Party has won the greatest love of the people. Korean Communist leader Kim Il-sung is currently the Chairman of the North Korean People's Committee, leading the coalition government in the region and carrying out thorough land reform. The Indonesian Communist Party is currently leading the Indonesian people in an unyielding struggle against British and Dutch armed aggressors. Its position in the Republican government is becoming increasingly important, with six people entering the cabinet. In the reorganization of the National Committee (equivalent to the National Assembly) on New Year's Day this year, the Communist Party increased from one seat to thirty-five seats.
　　In the Americas, the Chilean Communist Party was invited by President Videla to participate in the government last November. Three communists serve as Minister of Public Works, Minister of Agriculture and Public Land, and Minister of Colonial Affairs. The participation of the Chilean Communist Party in the government is a pioneering event in the political history of Latin America. The Chilean Communist Party already had 72,000 members in 1942.
　　In the above twenty countries, after the Communist Party participated in the government, not only has it shown progress and strength in politics, but also in the economy and culture. The reason lies in the fact that the awareness and unity of the broad masses of the people in various countries have been improved in this anti-fascist war and after the war, and they have realized that only the Communist Party is the savior of the people.
　　Although the communist parties in many other countries have not participated in the government, they have become indispensable leading forces in the struggle for peace and democracy, and are developing vigorously. The British Communist Party already has two seats in parliament. The workers under the leadership of the British Communist Party exceed 1.1 million. British Communist Central Committee member Arthur Horner was elected General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers. The chairman of the second largest trade union in the UK, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, is communist Jack Tanner. The British Communist Party has repeatedly criticized Bevin's foreign policy of following the United States. In events such as the British military intervention in Greece and the British and Dutch offensives in Indonesia, the British Communist Party has spoken out for the weak and condemned British imperialists. The political position of the British Communist Party is increasingly improving, and its主張 has won the support of the broad masses of Labor Party members. There are currently 45,000 members. In addition to the British Communist Party, the strength of the communist parties in European countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Greece is also developing rapidly. Before the war, the Danish Communist Party had only 6,000 members, no representatives in parliament, and the party newspaper sold 6,000 copies. By last June, its membership had increased to 60,000, with 18 members of parliament, and the party newspaper sells 50,000 copies. Before the war, the Dutch Communist Party had only 9,000 members, with three members of parliament. By last June, its membership had increased to 50,000, with 10 members of the House of Representatives, 5 senators, and the party newspaper sells 250,000 copies. In the municipal elections in Amsterdam (the capital of the Netherlands) last winter, the Dutch Communist Party jumped to become the largest party in the city. The Swedish Communist Party had 11,000 members in 1940, which increased to 22,000 in 1944, and then to 48,000 in 1945. The Greek Communist Party has become the most powerful party in the democratic front and is currently leading the People's Liberation Army in fighting against the reactionary government forces. On the northern border of Italy, in one of the smallest countries in the world, San Marino, in addition to the 20 members of the Democratic Alliance, the rest are communists and socialists. The Vice President is also a communist, which shows that the Communist Party and all democratic and progressive forces have universally developed in every corner after the war.
　　The Japanese Communist Party had only 1,200 members in 1945, which increased to 20,000 last May, an increase of 18 times in half a year. By January this year, it had increased to 59,000, more than doubling in half a year. Now, the Japanese Communist Party has become the backbone of the democratic movement, leading 13 parties to participate in the democratic front, and also occupies six seats in parliament. In addition, the communist parties in Asia, such as the Indian Communist Party, have become the only parties that can unite the masses of both the Hindu and Muslim faiths, with 55,000 members (only 5,000 in 1942). The Malayan Communist Party has 16,000 members. The Burmese Communist Party also has a strong national army under its leadership. The Burmese Communist Party is mainly responsible for the highest organization of the Burmese national liberation movement, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, with 6,000 members. The Philippine Communist Party is currently leading the broad masses of the people in an armed struggle against American imperialism and Philippine reactionaries for the true independence of the nation. The Lebanese Communist Party has 15,000 members (only 1,500 before the war). Palestine has 2,000 members.
　　The American Communist Party is constantly criticizing the reactionary foreign policy of the US authorities and actively supporting China's independent, peaceful, and democratic movement. The membership of the American Communist Party has grown from 70,000 in July last year to 100,000 in September, an increase of 30,000 in two months. The American Communist Party has become the backbone of the American democratic movement, not only in the labor movement, but also has a wide range of influence in newspapers, magazines, publishing, broadcasting, and film industries. In the Americas, there is also the Brazilian Communist Party, which had only 4,000 members in May 1945, which increased to 130,000 last May, an increase of 32 times in one year. It won the most votes in the state and city elections in January this year and achieved a great victory. The Canadian Communist Party also has 30,000 members.
　　There is also the Communist Party of Australia, with 30,000 members. The Communist Party of South Africa has 3,000 members in Africa and has a significant impact on miners.
　　Globally speaking, the Communist Party has undergone a universal and rapid development in this anti-fascist war, especially after the war, and is now leading the people of the world to fight for lasting peace.

　　保卫世界民主和平的各国共产党发展概况
    战争教育了人民，人民将赢得战争，赢得和平，又赢得进步，这就是目前世界新形势的规律。
                                                    ——毛泽东
    在反法西斯战争中，各国共产党人站在斗争的最前列，团结和领导人民走向胜利。在战争结束后，又是全世界和平民主的坚决保卫者，领导着人民对法西斯残余及反民主势力进行着坚决的斗争。因此，每一国家的共产党人都受到各该国人民的真诚热爱和积极拥护，把他们当作自己最亲信的代表选举到政府或议会里去。由于世界人民的觉悟程度空前提高，各国共产党力量急速发展，使战后世界迈步前进。苏联在共产党领导下，战胜了德国侵略者，拯救了全世界人类之后，更加强大无比，国际地位大大提高，联共拥有党员六百余万，成为保卫世界和平民主的中心堡垒。中国共产党领导中国人民经过八年苦斗，战胜日本侵略者之后，空前壮大，党员增至二百二十万，已成为中国人民反对蒋介石卖国、内战、独裁和坚持独立、和平、民主的中心力量。此外，全世界已经有二十个国家的共产党在政府中负着重要的职务，而在这次战争前，这些国家是从来没有共产党参加政府的。
    在欧洲，有法国、意大利、捷克、波兰、南斯拉夫、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、芬兰、挪威、比利时、冰岛、奥地利、西班牙（按：指现在墨西哥的民主西班牙政府，非指佛朗哥政府）及德国等十六个国家的政府，或由共产党组织或有共产党参加。由共产党领导组织政府的有南斯拉夫、保加利亚、捷克、阿尔巴尼亚四国。南斯拉夫是著名的铁托元帅任内阁总理，副总理也是共产党员卡德尔。保加利亚去年十月的大选，保共获得重大胜利，在新议会四六五席议员中占二七七席，保共领袖季米特洛夫组成新政府。现有党员四十万，平均十七人中有一共产党员。捷克去年五月的大选，捷共一跃而为捷克第一大党，议会的票数双倍于第二党——国家社会党，捷共负责组成了民主的联合政府，捷共领袖哥特瓦尔德任内阁总理，在二十六席阁员中捷共占九席。有党员一百三十万（连斯洛伐克在内），平均每八个人中有一共产党员。阿尔巴尼亚人民政府的主席是共产党员霍查上将，他是阿国复国的元勋，是八万阿国民族解放军的统帅，也是阿国人民阵线的主席。
    波兰的共产党又叫工人党，举国一致的联合政府的副总理，就是工人党人哥德尔卡。波共有党员三十一万人。
    在罗马尼亚、匈牙利、芬兰这些前德国附庸国家中，共产党曾因反法西斯而受到残酷摧残，但他们获得人民热烈拥护，始终坚强不屈的奋斗，终于把他们的国家从德国掌握里挽救出来。在战争后，他们在政府里都占有重要的位置。罗马尼亚的联合政府中，共产党与农民党、社会民主党各占三个部长席。去年十一月的国会选举，民主政党集团获压倒胜利，新议会四一四席中占三四八席。罗共领导下的劳动总同盟有一百五十万会员。匈牙利共产党在联合政府中占了四个部长席，在议会中占有百分之二十的席数，有党员十六万。芬兰共产党在战前是不能公开活动的，受摧残很厉害，但是，它领导芬兰强有力的人民团体“芬兰人民民主联盟”，和芬兰社会民主党及农民党共组政府，担任着内政部长等重要位置。在一九三九年芬共只有二千党员，在议会内没有代表，到去年六月，党员增至二万八千，议会内有四九名议员（占四分之一），党报日销十五万份。
    另外一个中途退出轴心的国家是意大利。意大利共产党在反抗德国人的时候，曾在意北组织了二十五万游击队，墨索里尼就是意共游击队抓到抢毙的。意大利加入盟军作战以后，那一届的政府也离不开意共，意共领袖爱尔科里曾任司法部长、内阁副总理等职。在去年六月的大选中，虽然国内外反动势力集中力量攻击意共，但还是获得一○五席，与它的联盟党——社会党合计起来，是议会里席数最多的联盟。去年二月间有党员一百八十万人，到十月即增为二百一十六万。年底罗马等六大都市的市选，共产党已压倒了基督教民主党（六月大选的首席党，以现任总理加斯贝利为首）。
    在西欧、北欧曾被德国占领过的国家——法国、比利时、挪威及中南欧的奥地利，各该国的共产党在政府里也占着重要的位置，北欧小国冰岛的共产党也已参加了政府工作。法共在战前为第三大党，四五年十月大选中法共跃为首席党；去年六月大选中，由于国内外反动派一起攻击法共，选举结果，法共虽退居第二大党，但议席只比上届少一席，还占一五○席；在比道尔的内阁中，法共占七席，多列士任副总统；十一月的大选，法共又荣膺议会首席大党，在国民议会中获一六八席，在法政府，法共占有国防部等五个部长职位多列士任副总理。法共在战前只有四万党员，到去年五月即增至一百廿万人，较法国其他各党派人数的总和还要多。党报日销二百余万份。法国四十个产业工会，有三十个是在法共领导下的。比利时共产党在一九三九年只有一万党员，议会里有九席议员，党报日销一万份，到去年六月党员增至十万人，在国会里，有二十名众议员与十一名参议员，在省议会里占五十八席，在工业城市如列日等城均占首位。党报日销十一万份。在现政府中有四名阁员，十一月，比共主席朱理安拉维特当选众院副院长。挪威共产党在一九三九年只有三千余党员，议会里没有代表，到去年六月党员增至三万三千，有议员十三名，党报日销五万份。现政府中有两名阁员。在奥地利，奥共与社会党结成联盟，在内阁中奥共占一席，社会党占五席，在议会中，两党共占七十六席。奥共在一九三三年仅有党员八千人，到去年六月即增至十三万人，党报日销四十五万份。冰岛共产党已参加了政府。冰共在一九三九年有六百党员，到去年六月增至一千一百人，党报发行四千份。
    在德国，虽然英美占领区还压抑共产党活动，但德共已有六十七万党员，计划最短期内发展到一百万，如果追溯战前只有三十五万，可见它发展很快。在苏军占领区，德共已参加地方政府工作，去年二月德共与社会党（有党员百余万）合并组织成统一社会党，成为德国最大的政党。最近又与美英占领区的共产党统一行动，共组中央执行委员会。
    西班牙共产党在一九三六年人民阵线当权时代，曾是一个强有力的政党，共和军失败后，直到现在，西共还有二万五千党员在国内坚持反佛朗哥斗争，去年四月间，西共派了一个代表参加流亡在墨西哥的吉拉尔共和政府。
    以上十六国的共产党，都坚决进行着“耕者有其四”的土地改革政策及保障劳动福利。如波、保、罗、匈、奥、捷、阿、南及德国苏军占领区，有的已经完成“耕者有其田”的土地改革，有的正在大力进行，使得广大劳动人民得到了翻身的机会。（⑶⑷）
    在亚洲，也有三个国家的共产党组织起政府或参加政府。越南共和国政府的主席，就是越共领袖胡志明，他所领导下的人民政府，系由越共领导的越南独立同盟、民主党、革命同盟及无党派人士组成。在抗日战争中，越共领导下的人民解放军有五十万人。朝鲜共产党虽然在美占领区尚受压迫，鲜共中委会被无理逮捕，但在苏占领的鲜北，鲜共已获得人民的最大爱戴，鲜共领袖金贻逊，现任鲜北人民委员会主席，领导该地区的联合政府，正在进行彻底地土地改革。印尼共产党现正领导着印尼人民，对英、荷武装侵略者进行着不屈不挠的斗争。在共和政府中的地位日益重要，有六人入阁，今年元旦的民族委员会（相当于国民议会）改组中，共产党由一席增至三十五席。
    在美洲，智利共产党是去年十一月应总统魏德拉之邀请参加政府的，三位共产党人分任公共工程、农业与公共土地、殖民部长，智共之参加政府，是拉丁美洲政治史上之创举。智共在一九四二年即有党员七万二千人。
    在以上二十个国家里，有了共产党参加政府之后，不但在政治上表现了进步有力量，在经济及文化方面也有飞跃的发展。原因就在于各国广大人民在这次反法西斯战争中及战争后，觉悟和团结都提高了，认清了只有共产党才是人民的救星。
    其它许多国家内的共产党虽未参加政府，但在和平民主的斗争中，也已经成了不可缺少的领导力量，并正在蓬勃的发展中。英国共产党在议会里已有了两席，英共领导下的工人超过一百一十万人，英共中委霍尔纳当选为全国矿工联盟总书记，英国第二大工会机器工会的主席就是共产党员唐纳。对贝文追随美国的外交政策，英共屡予抨击，英军干涉希腊内政，英、荷进攻印尼等事件中，英共都为弱小民族仗义执言，斥责英帝国主义分子。英共在英国的政治地位已在日益提高，它的主张已获得了工党广大党员的支持。现有党员四万五千。除英共外，欧洲丹麦、荷兰、瑞典、希腊等国的共产党，其力量也在急速的发展着。丹麦共产党在战前只有六千党员，议会内没有代表、党报日销六千份，到去年六月党员增至六万人，有议员十八名，党报日销五万份。荷兰共产党战前只有九千党员，在众院有三名议员，到去年六月党员增至五万，有十名众议员，五名参议员，党报日销二十五万份。去冬荷姆斯特丹（荷京）市选中，荷共一跃而为该市第一大党。瑞典共产党在四○年有一万一千党员，四四年增至二万二千，四五年即增至四万八千。希腊共产党已成为民主阵线中最有力量的政党，现正领导人民解放军与反动政府军作战。意大利北部边界上，一个世界上最小的国家——圣马利诺，六十个议员中除了二十名民主同盟外，其余就是共产党与社会党，副总统也有一个共产党员，可见共产党和一切民主进步力量，战后在每个角落都是普遍发展起来了。
    日本共产党，一九四五年的只有一千二百名党员到去年五月增至两万人，半年内增加了十八倍，到今年一月即增至五万九千人，半年内又增加了两倍多。现在日共已成为民主运动的中坚，领导着十三个党派参加民主阵线，在议会中也占有六席。此外，亚洲的共产党，如印度共产党已成为唯一能团结印、回两教群众的政党，有党员五万五千（四二年只有五千人）。马来亚共产党有党员一万六千。缅甸共产党领导下也有一支坚强的国民军，缅甸民族解放运动的最高组织——反法西斯人民自由联盟，缅共负着主要的责任，有党员六千。菲律宾共产党现正领导着广大人民为了民族的真正独立，与美帝国主义及菲反动派进行武装斗争。黎巴嫩共产党有党员一万五千（战前只一千五百人）。巴勒斯坦有党员二千。
    美国共产党，不断抨击美当局的反动外交政策，并积极声援中国的独立和平民主运动。美共党员已由去年七月的七万人发展到九月的十万人，两月内增加三万。美共已成为美国民主运动的中坚，不仅在工人运动中，且在若干报纸、杂志、出版、广播与电影各业中，均有广泛影响。美洲还有巴西共产党，一九四五年五月只有党员四千人，到去年五月即增为十三万人，一年内增加三十二倍，今年一月的州市选举中获票最多，获得大胜。加拿大共产党也有党员三万。
    还有澳大利亚的共产党，有党员三万。非洲的南非共产党有党员三千，在矿工中有重大的影响。
    在全世界说来，共产党在这次反法西斯战争中特别是战争后，有了普遍的飞跃的发展，现在正领导着世界人民为争取持久的和平而斗争。
