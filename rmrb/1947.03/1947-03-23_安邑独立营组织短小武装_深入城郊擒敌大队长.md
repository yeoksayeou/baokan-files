(This report from Taiyue on the 21st) The Anyi Independent Battalion, standing firm in the Jinnan triangle area, has organized small armed units to penetrate the enemy's heartland around Anyi city, posing a serious threat. Comrade Yang Shiying's detachment, from the 28th of last month to the 5th of this month, achieved a glorious record of zero casualties while capturing thirteen members of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army, including a battalion commander, and seizing eight long and short guns and a set of important documents. On the 28th of last month, the team captured seven enemy puppet soldiers upon their first action. On the 5th of this month, they conducted a second operation around Anyi city and encountered six members of the "Love the Homeland Corps." They cleverly and boldly approached the enemy, and when only a few dozen steps away, an enemy platoon leader asked, "Which unit are you from?" Yang and others retorted, "Which unit are *you* from? What are you doing here?" The enemy replied, "We are the Fifth Company of the Xiaxian Love the Homeland Corps." A member of Yang's unit replied from the side, "We are from the Anyi Security Battalion, here to send something to the battalion commander." With three questions and two answers, they moved closer to the enemy. Comrade Yang Shiying, adopting the tone of a battalion commander, lectured the enemy platoon leader: "Seeing how afraid of death you are, you raise your guns to scare people without seeing whether they are your own or the Eighth Route Army?" The six enemies were so frightened that they stood aside, afraid to move. Then, Comrade Yang Shiying asked in surprise, "Why are you out here in civilian clothes? That's not right, is it?" The enemy platoon leader replied, "We have passes. We're out on patrol." Comrade Shiying, feigning distrust, ordered his soldiers, "Take their guns first, and we'll go to Xiaxian together to talk about it." The six stubborn soldiers were thus captured.

    安邑独立营组织短小武装
    深入城郊擒敌大队长
    【本报太岳二十一日电】屹立于晋南三角地带的安邑独立营组织短小武装，深入敌腹心安邑城周活动，给敌以严重威胁。杨士英同志所率领的一个分遣队自上月二十八日至本月五日，以零比十三之光荣成绩，捕捉蒋伪军大队长以下十三人，缴获长短枪八支，重要文件一部。上月二十八日，该队出马即捕捉敌伪军七名，本月五日又二次到安邑城周活动，与六个“爱乡团”团员遭遇，他们机警大胆的接近敌人，仅距数十步远时，敌一排长问：“你们是那一部分？”杨等反问：“你们那一部分？来干什么？”敌人回答：“我们是夏县爱乡团五连。”杨部一队员在旁回说：“我们是安邑保安大队来送营长的。”三问两答之间，更接近了敌人。杨士英同志装出营长的口气教训敌人的排长：“看你们这么怕死，不看是自己人还是八路军，就把枪举起来吓唬谁？”六个敌人吓得站在一旁不敢动。接着，杨士英同志惊奇的问：“你们怎么穿着便衣出来活动，不对吧？”敌排长答：“有路条，我们是出来游击的。”士英同志装出不信任的态度，给战士下命令说：“把他们的枪先带起来，一同到夏县再说。”六个顽军就这样被俘虏了。
