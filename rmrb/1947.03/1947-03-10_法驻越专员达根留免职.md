Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. According to various sources, the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, D'Argenlieu, was dismissed by the French cabinet on the 6th, and his vacancy has been filled by the appointment of Bolaert. D'Argenlieu was a staunch advocate of reconquering Vietnam by force. Some people in Paris believe that this transfer is related to the recent developments in the Franco-Vietnamese war, because since the beginning of this month, the Vietnamese people's war of self-defense has spread to Cambodia, a French "protectorate" not far from Saigon. At the same time, the Vietnamese army launched a counter-offensive in Hanoi and other places in the north, and the French transportation line between Haiphong and Hanoi was cut off from time to time.

　　法驻越专员达根留免职
    【新华社延安八日电】综合各方消息：法国驻越南之高级专员达根留，已于六日为法内阁免职，遗缺已任命鲍拉埃继任。达氏系坚决主张以武力重新征服越南者。巴黎若干人士认为此次调动与法越战事之最近发展有关，缘本月初起，越南人民的自卫战争已发展至柬埔寨，此为距西贡不远的法国“保护国”，同时在北部河内等地越军发动反攻，海防河内间之法方交通线，时被切断。
