Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: A certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army recovered Nong'an County, 70 kilometers northwest of Changchun, at 4 PM on the 25th. Since the Democratic Allied Army annihilated five battalions of the Chiang army's American-equipped New First Army's 30th Division on the 23rd, and recovered Chengzi Street northeast of Jiutai, the Chiang army entrenched in various strongholds north of Changchun has been shaken. The Chiang army in Nong'an abandoned the city and fled south. Nong'an was occupied by the Chiang army's New Sixth Army on May 26th of last year. During the more than eight months of their occupation, the residents suffered greatly. After the democratic county government entered the city with the army, they immediately began to offer condolences and relief.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: The Chiang army's third offensive plan against the Linjiang area of ​​Andong Province has been crushed by the heroic Liaodong soldiers and civilians. This time, the Chiang army began its offensive on the 18th, advancing in four routes from Jinchuan, Liuhe, Tonghua, and other places. Their forces included the entire 71st Division and 91st Division, the main force of the 2nd Division of the 51st Army, and parts of the 22nd Division of the New Sixth Army and the Provisional 21st Division of the 60th Army. By the night of the 23rd, all routes of the Chiang army had been repelled. In this battle, over 4,000 Chiang soldiers were captured alive alone. Detailed battle results are still being verified.
