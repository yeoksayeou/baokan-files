Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 30th: London dispatch: During a question session in the British House of Commons on the afternoon of the 17th, the British government displayed cautious remarks regarding Truman's statement on aid to Greece and Turkey, and expressed concern about Labor Party members' discussions regarding American intervention in the Near East. When parliamentarians requested the British government to explain: (1) the circumstances of consultations between the British and American governments before Truman's statement; (2) whether the US government had notified the British government of the content of Truman's statement in advance, and whether the British government had participated in providing opinions, the Minister of State, McNeil, replied that his position did not allow him to issue detailed statements on this matter. However, the British government had not consulted with the US government in advance regarding Truman's statement. The British government had notified the US government through normal diplomatic channels that Britain would cease financial aid to Greece after March 31st. The British government knew nothing about the political conditions attached to the American proposal to aid Greece. Labor Party members Osbon and Sifmen questioned whether the British government would make recommendations to the US regarding US military aid to Turkey, arguing that material aid without appropriate conditions would be unfortunate.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 18th: London dispatch: Labor Party member Thomas declared during a debate in the House of Commons on March 14th regarding British loans to Greece: It is a tragedy to take money to help the current Greek system, "a system that is making those who fought in the Greek puppet army during the war suffer," and it is impossible for Britain not to know that the gendarmerie includes well-known Hitler collaborators.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 17th: Athens dispatch: The left-wing Liberal Party of Greece issued a statement on the 18th regarding Truman's speech, emphasizing that the United States is using Greece for its own political and strategic purposes, which violates the true interests of the Greek people.

    美国援助土、希以插足近东
    英国议员纷表关切
    【新华社延安三十日电】伦敦消息：英下院于十七日下午举行质询时，显示英政府对杜鲁门援助希土之声明发言谨慎，并对工党议员论及美国插足近东一事，表示关切。若于议员要求英政府说明：（一）英美两国政府在杜鲁门发表声明前之协商情形。（二）美政府是否事先以杜鲁门，声明内容通知英政府？英政府有否参加意见？国务大臣麦克尼尔答称：彼之地位未能就此事发表详细声明，惟英政府事先未与美政府商讨杜鲁门声明。英政府曾由正常外交途径通告美政府英国将于三月三十一日，后停止对希财政援助。英政府对美国建议援助希腊之政治条件，一无所悉。工党议员奥斯汶与锡弗门质问英政府对美国军事援助土耳其是否将向美国提出建议？盖实事援助如未配合以适当条件则将获不幸。
    【新华社延安十八日电】伦敦讯：工党议员汤姆斯于三月十四日在下院辩论英国对希贷款时宣称：拿钱去帮助目前希腊的制度，“这种制度使战时打过希腊伪军的人们还正在受苦”，是一个悲剧，英国不可能不知道宪兵队中包容有闻名的希特勒合作者。
    【新华社延安十七日电】雅典讯：希左翼之自由党于十八日关于杜鲁门的讲演发表声明，强调美国为它自己的政治与战略目的而利用希腊的意见，是违犯希腊人民真正利益的。
