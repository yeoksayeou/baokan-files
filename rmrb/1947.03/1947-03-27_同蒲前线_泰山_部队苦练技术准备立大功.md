    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 25th] Since the "Taishan" unit on the Tongpu Front launched the merit-making campaign, it has achieved the expected results. In order to achieve great merits in the future, the soldiers are competing to practice hard during combat intervals, getting up at dawn to throw grenades. Liberated soldier Tang Fa Gui, despite suffering from eye problems, insisted on going to the training ground, saying, "Earning merit is for the people, and also for myself. In the future, when we fight back to Shaanxi, we will liberate my home." New soldier Hao Quande also clamored to keep up with the veteran soldiers. His arm was already swollen from throwing grenades, but he still practiced whenever he had time. He said, "I can't improve if I don't get through these few days." In order to promote the widespread development of the merit-making campaign, the leadership has called on all commanders and fighters to continue to vigorously promote this campaign, pointing out that this campaign is an organizational method and leadership approach for leveraging everyone's enthusiasm and creativity. They also put forward the following points of attention for carrying out this campaign: (1) It should be widely carried out and continuously conducted, so that this work is carried out from the company to the organization, from the cadres to the soldiers, from peacetime to wartime. (2) Credit should be recorded for merits, and advantages should be promoted. Do not obliterate even small merits, ensuring that not a single merit of each person is missed. It must be ensured that: (a) those with merit do not compete for credit, and leaders should meticulously record merits; (b) before evaluation, there should be extensive deliberation and democratic discussion to ensure that merits are reported truthfully and evaluated fairly. (3) Recording merits should not be generalized, but should be based on the significance and role of completing the task, as well as subjective efforts, timeliness of completion, and costs paid. (4) Plans should be made for completing tasks, and inspections should be carried out frequently according to the plans. (5) Strengthen organizational work, determine grades according to merits, establish registration methods, and commend in a timely manner.
