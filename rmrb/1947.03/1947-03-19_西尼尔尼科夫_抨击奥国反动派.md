　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: TASS reports: Sinelnikov recently published an article in Red Star, commenting on the Austrian issue, stating: "It is well known that Austria was liberated by the Soviet and Allied forces, but the Austrian ruling group is now making every effort to distort this historical fact, and they are trying to minimize Austria's actual crimes in the war. Last year, the Austrian Prime Minister began to talk about Austria's 'self-liberation.' The Austrian government's memorandum to the London Foreign Ministers Conference and the speech by Schuschnigg, one of the leaders of the People's Party, also pursue the same goal. According to materials from the Austrian Institute of Finance, Austria supplied a total of 1.5 million to 1.6 million officers and soldiers to Hitler's Germany during World War II, which amounted to two-thirds of Austria's adult men between 1938 and 1945. Austria was also Germany's 'arsenal and bomb depot.' After the annexation of Austria by Germany, 153 large and medium-sized arms factories were established and rebuilt in the eastern provinces of Austria alone, and the western provinces of Austria were no exception. Although the anti-Hitler struggle in Austria was actively based, the scale of its resistance movement was negligible. Even after the Soviet and Allied forces entered its territory, no force rose to strike the retreating Hitler's army. Post-war Austria has not yet done everything to democratize the country. Austria has been liberated for two years, but the law to abolish Nazification was only passed a few months ago, and this was due to pressure from the Allied Council. The Allied Council even had to add many amendments to the bill."

    抨击奥国反动派
    【新华社延安十六日电】塔斯社讯：西尼尔尼科夫顷在红星报上撰文评论奥国问题内称：“人所周知，奥国系由苏军与盟军所解放的，但是奥国统治集团现正尽一切努力以歪曲这一历史事实，他们并试图与小奥国在战争中所起的实际罪恶。去年奥总理开始了奥地利“自己解放”的言论，奥政府致伦敦外长代表会议的备忘录及人民党领袖之一舒糙的米的讲演亦追求同样的目的；根据奥国财政研究院的材料，在第二次世界大战时期奥国总共供给希特勒德国官兵一百五十万到一百六十万人，达一九三八至一九四五年间奥国成年男子的三分之二。奥国又是德国的“军火库与炸弹储存所”，在德奥合并之后，单在奥国东部各省即建立了与重建了一百五十三个巨大的大中型的兵工厂，奥国西部各省亦无例外。在奥国反希特勒斗争固基积极，但其抵抗运动的规模是微不足道的，甚至在苏军与盟军进入其国土之后，尚没有一枝力量起来打击退却的希特勒军队。战后的奥国还没有作到使该国实行民主化的一切事情，奥国获得解放已经两年了，但仅在数月之前始通过废除纳粹化的法律，而且这还是由于盟国委员会施以压力的结果。盟国委员会且不得不对该法案加上许多修正。
