　　The Handan Radio Station Deeply Praised Nationally
    Sets Ambitious Goals for Further Improvement
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Handan Radio Station, born amidst difficulties and becoming one of the trumpets of the people nationwide, has received favorable comments from people all over the country. Listeners in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Kunming, and other places have sent letters praising: "The Handan Radio Station is very good; the sound is very clear." Now, in order to further improve, the staff of the station, after in-depth discussions, have set out ambitious goals for the first half of the year. The first is to strive for the initiative in propaganda, with planned and organized reporting. The steps to achieve this goal are to enrich the workforce and improve the organization, so that the liaison, editing, information, graphics, and literature and art departments can be quickly established. Efforts should be made to make the programs diverse and rich, the news timely, the wording as colloquial as possible, short and concise, the pronunciation clear when broadcasting, the articulation fluent, the intonation with ups and downs, and full of emotion. Small programs such as dramas, stories, and songs should also be broadcast. The station's broadcast for the "March 8th" Women's Day began to be more complete, vivid, and lively. With the heartfelt care and multifaceted assistance of various agencies, the entire staff is working hard to complete and exceed their ambitious goals as soon as possible.
