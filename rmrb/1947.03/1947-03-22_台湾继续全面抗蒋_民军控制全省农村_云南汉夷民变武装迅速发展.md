    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th -- The people of Taiwan are continuing their full-scale resistance against the dark rule of the Chiang government. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai, Chen Bisheng, one of the representatives of six Taiwanese groups stationed in Shanghai who went to Nanjing to petition, told reporters on the 13th that since Chiang's reinforcements arrived in Taiwan Province, the people's armed forces have poured out of the mountains to fight Chiang's troops. The people's army controls the vast rural areas of the province and effectively controls three important cities, including Taitung. Chiang's troops are currently only holding seven cities. According to a Central News Agency report on the 13th, the cities of Tainan, Taichung, and Chiayi, which are held by the Chiang government, have not fully restored "order," and the "martial law" in Taipei and the important port of Keelung has not been lifted. Due to the interruption of transportation, prices in Taipei have risen twice as high as before the February 28th Incident. According to United Press, Chen Bisheng condemned: When the Kuomintang reinforcements arrived in Taiwan Province, Chen Yi immediately went back on all the "political reform" promises he had announced and has begun to arrest large numbers of university students, professors, and leaders from all walks of life (including provincial senators).

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th -- According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 17th: The Chiang government's deceptive policy towards the people of Taiwan has failed. Many Taiwanese youths who participated in the Taiwan autonomy movement, disregarding Bai Chongxi's so-called "leniency," have successively entered the mountains.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th -- A New China Daily Kunming dispatch from Chongqing on February 4th cited Kunming newspaper reports: Various newspapers revealed that the armed uprisings of Han and Yi people in various parts of Yunnan have further developed recently. The armed forces of ethnic minorities in the Puxiong area of ​​Jianshui County, southern Yunnan, who resisted the Chiang government, numbered only several hundred last year, but now number more than two thousand. At the end of last year, Chiang's troops launched a large-scale "suppression campaign" and established a small airport in the nearby Ganheba area, using aircraft to assist in the battle, but to no avail. The rebel troops of Long Yonghe in Shiping County also originally numbered several hundred, but have recently grown to six or seven thousand, operating in the Tachong area. The hundreds of rebel troops between Simao and Puer in southwestern Yunnan have been increasing in size recently, making Chiang's troops afraid to easily "suppress" them. The mountainous area on the southwest bank of the Jinsha River in western Yunnan was originally a base for more than ten thousand Yi ethnic armed forces. In January, a rebel unit equipped with American-style weapons appeared at the junction of Binchuan, Heqing, and Dengchuan counties, firing submachine guns in a demonstration, causing the local militia to dare not attack. Since December, rebel troops numbering several thousand or more than a hundred have appeared several times outside the county seat of Shizong County in eastern Yunnan and near Chengyaoshi in the county. As for the activities of small rebel groups, they are everywhere. According to various newspapers, the reasons for the widespread uprisings in Yunnan are that Chiang Kai-shek massively dismissed Yunnan troops, restored the tyrannical policies of conscription and grain requisition, leading to dire living conditions, and severely oppressed ethnic minorities, forcing the people to take desperate risks. When Chiang Kai-shek seized political power in Yunnan, rebel activities were only sporadic on the Yunnan-Guizhou Road and in western Yunnan. By last winter, they had spread throughout the province.

    台湾继续全面抗蒋
    民军控制全省农村 
    云南汉夷民变武装迅速发展
    【新华社延安二十九日电】台湾人民刻正继续全面反抗蒋政府之黑暗统治。据合众社沪讯，台人驻沪六团体赴京请愿代表之一陈碧生，十三日招待记者称：自蒋军援军到达台省后，该省人民武装从各处山地涌出与蒋军作战，民军控制全省广大农村，并确实控制台东等三个重要城市，蒋军现仅据守七个城市。据十三日中央社称，蒋政府据守之台南、台中、嘉义等城市尚未完全恢复“秩序”，省曾台北及重要港口基隆“戒严”迄未解除。台北因交通断绝物价已较二、二八事件前涨两倍。据合众社称，陈碧生谴责谓：当国民党增援部队抵达台省后，陈仪立即自食其已宣布的一切“改革政治”之诺言，且已开始大批逮捕大学学生、教授及各界领袖（包括省参议员）。
    【新华社延安二十日电】据合众社上海十七日消息：蒋政府对台湾人民之欺骗政策已遭失败，许多参加台湾自治运动之台湾青年不顾白崇禧所宣示之所谓“宽大为怀”，相继进入山中。
    【新华社延安二十日电】重庆新华日报昆明二月四日通讯引昆明报纸消息：各报透露，日前云南各地汉夷民变武装有进一步发展。滇南建水县属普雄一带少数民族反抗蒋政府之武装，去年仅数百人，现达两千以上。去年年底蒋军曾大举“进剿”，并在附近干河坝建立小型机场，用飞机助战，迄未收效。石屏变民龙永和部原亦数百人，近已发展至六七千人，活动于塔冲一带。滇西南思茅、普洱间之数百变民队伍，近来规模愈大，使蒋军不敢轻易“进剿”。滇西金沙江西南岸山地，原为万余夷族武装之根据地，一月间宾川、鹤庆、邓川三县交界处更出现美式装备之变民一部，连放冲锋枪示威，使当地团队不敢出击。滇东师宗县城外三、四里地方及县属撑腰石附近，自十二月以来多次出现数千或百余人之变民队伍。至小部变民的活动，则到处皆是。据各报称：云南民变蜂起之原因为蒋介石大量裁遣滇军，恢复征兵征粮暴政，生活惨苦，与极度压迫少数民族，人民被迫挺而走险。蒋介石夺取云南政权之初，仅滇黔路上及滇西时有变民活动，至去冬则蔓延全省各地。
