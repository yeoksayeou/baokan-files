Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: A dispatch from Shanghai on the 28th states: Private industrial and commercial enterprises here are increasingly in dire straits due to the aggressive price hikes of American goods and the Kuomintang government's public utilities. Since Chiang Kai-shek announced on the 17th of last month the adjustment of the exchange rate to three times the original amount, i.e., 12,000 yuan, the prices of foreign goods have soared daily, increasing by 55% to 100% within a week. For example, a regular suit costing 480,000 yuan sold for over 800,000 yuan on the 23rd, and American white-edged serge has risen from 30,000 yuan per yard to 60,000 yuan. General public utilities are also using the excuse of increased costs making it impossible to maintain operations and are requesting price increases from the Kuomintang municipal government's public utilities bureau. Trolley buses plan to increase prices by 100% from March 1st, and public buses by 400% to 1400%. Private industrial and commercial enterprises, unable to withstand the pressure, are also demanding price increases. The tea industry association is carrying out petitions, and the flour and cooking oil industries are also requesting price increases.

　　上海物价继续腾涨
    【新华社延安七日电】二十八日沪讯：此间民营工商业正因美货及蒋政府公营事业之猛烈涨价而益陷绝境，由于上月十七日蒋介石宣布调整外汇至原数三倍即一万二千元，外货价格连日飞升，一周内上涨达百分之五十五至百分之一百不等，如普通四十八万元一套的西装在二十三日已需八十万元以上，美国白边醇尔呢已自三万元一码涨至六万元，一般公用事业亦以成本增加不能维持为借口，向蒋记市府公用局要求增价，电车拟自三月一日增价百分之百，公共汽车增百分之四百至一千四百。民营工商业不堪压迫亦要求加价，茶叶业会进行请愿、面粉业食油业等亦要求加价。
