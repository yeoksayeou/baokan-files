    Xinhua Bookstore Establishes Mobile Bookstore

    [Our Newspaper] In order to expand its readership, the North China Xinhua Bookstore, taking advantage of the ×× and ×× horse and mule fairs, sent personnel to carry books and stationery to set up mobile bookstores. They were enthusiastically welcomed by the masses. Liberated peasants eagerly purchased popular reading materials, and children bought textbooks, paper, and pens. In total, over 100,000 yuan worth of books were sold during the two events. Recently, the bookstore is preparing to participate in the Shexian County ×× horse and mule fair, and has specially prepared crude cloth tents and advertising posters for the mobile bookstore. The bookstore will continue to promote books and journals through mobile bookstores in the future, delivering newly published books to readers quickly.

    新华书店设流动书店
    【本报讯】华北新华书店为扩大读者群，利用××、××骡马大会，派人担去书籍文具开设流动书店，得到群众热烈欢迎，翻身农民争购通俗读物，儿童们买课本、纸笔等。总计两次售出十万余元的书籍。最近该店正准备参加涉县××骡马大会，特为流动书店制备粗布棚，画广告画。该店今后将继续以流动书店方式推销书志，将出版的新书迅速送到读者手里。
