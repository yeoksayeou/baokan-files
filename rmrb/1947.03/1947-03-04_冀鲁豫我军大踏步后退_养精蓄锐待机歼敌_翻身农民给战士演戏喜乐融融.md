　　[This Dispatch from the Jilu-Yu Front by this Newspaper] Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Pu reports: General Liu Bocheng's troops, after advancing in big strides and victoriously attacking the Longhai Railway, have now withdrawn in big strides to a certain place, conserving strength and waiting for opportunities to annihilate the enemy. The reporter arrived at a certain place with the army at three o'clock in the morning on the 20th. That evening, the cultural troupe of a certain brigade hosted an entertainment evening, with the participation of rural theater troupes organized by liberated peasants from the stationed area. The stage was built with large carts and door panels, which was very convenient. The cultural troupe performed three short plays, two of which were about the relationship between the army and the people, and one about the life of the troops, which were very popular among the soldiers; the soldiers who had just been liberated from the KMT army were particularly interested. The reporter chatted with a soldier in the audience. He had been a soldier in the KMT army for nine years, and this time he was liberated from the Longhai Railway and joined the Eighth Route Army. He said: I didn't expect that we would be putting on plays so quickly after just fighting and marching. The Eighth Route Army's affairs are really a bit "strange." The reporter asked him: How is life these days? He said: The superiors announced that we will be practicing military exercises in the morning and evening these days, doing cleaning and sanitation during the day, and also eating a few good meals of meat. Our company has already had two meals. The reporter then asked him: Do you understand the principle of the Eighth Route Army's big step withdrawal? He said: Today the instructor said that our method is really good. For example, while our class is leisurely watching the play, the enemy does not know where our main force is, advancing while being worried and scared. We are watching clearly in the open, seizing the opportunity to suddenly strike him, and it would be strange if he doesn't have bad luck!

　　冀鲁豫我军大踏步后退
    养精蓄锐待机歼敌
    翻身农民给战士演戏喜乐融融
    【本报冀鲁豫前线一日电】新华社记者李普报导：刘伯承将军所部于大踏步前进胜利出击陇海路后，现已大踏步后退至某地，养精蓄锐、待机歼敌。记者于二十日清晨三时随军到达某地。当晚某旅文工队主持娱乐晚会，并有驻地翻身农民组织的农村剧团参加出演。戏台用大车和门板搭成，非常便捷。文工队演出短剧三场，两场的内容是军民关系，一场是部队生活，很受战士欢迎；刚从蒋军解放过来的战士，尤感兴趣。记者在场中和一个战士闲谈，他在蒋军当兵九年，这次从陇海路解放过来，参加了八路军。他说：想不到刚刚打过仗，行过军，这样快就演起戏来。八路军的事情真有点“奇怪”。记者问他：这几天生活如何？他说：上级宣布了这几天早晚演习军事，白天搞清洁卫生，还要好好吃几顿肉，我们连上已经吃过两次了。记者又问他：懂不懂得八路军大踏步沤退的道理？他说：今天指导员说过，我们的这办法真不错。比如我们班在安安闲闲看戏，敌人却不知道我们的主力到了那里，一面前进，一面提心吊胆。我们在明处看的清清楚楚，抓住机会，猛然干他一下，他不倒霉才有鬼哩！
