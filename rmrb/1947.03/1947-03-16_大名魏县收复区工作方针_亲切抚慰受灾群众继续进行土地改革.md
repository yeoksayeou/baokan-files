　　Work Guidelines for the Recovered Areas of Daming and Wei Counties
    Cordially Comfort the Disaster-stricken Masses and Continue Land Reform
    [Report from our Jinnan Office on the 14th] A reporter from the Jinnan Branch of the Xinhua News Agency recently interviewed Comrade Jiao Shanmin, Political Commissar of the Third Sub-district, and Commissioner Wen regarding the work in the recovered areas of Daming and Wei counties. Comrade Jiao Shanmin stated: The main reason why Wei and Da were able to persist victoriously this time was due to the land reform movement carried out last year, and the firm execution of the slogan "The county will not leave the county, and the district will not leave the district" by county and district cadres. At present, the main task in the recovered areas of Wei and Da should be to carry out post-war rehabilitation and restore democratic order. Two points deserve special attention: First, we must fully recognize that the fear and resentment of some of the masses in the recovered areas are temporary and inevitable. We must patiently listen to the opinions of the masses, unconditionally accept the correct criticisms of the masses, and carry out thorough door-to-door condolences and relief work. Only when the masses receive genuine warmth will their morale be boosted again. Second, the restoration of democratic order should go through a process and should be carried out according to the urgent demands of the masses. At present, the following tasks should be grasped in the recovered areas: 1. Through in-depth investigation and research into the various atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, use the facts to educate the masses, inspire hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and raise morale; understand the urgent demands of the masses during the investigation. 2. Resolutely destroy the Chiang Kai-shek puppet order and call on personnel of puppet organizations to repent and start anew with the government. 3. In order to solve the difficulties in the lives and production of the masses, the Commissioner's Office has allocated 700,000 catties of grain to provide relief to the refugees, and to bury and comfort the heroic village cadres and military dependents who died for the country. 4. The county and district should conscientiously summarize the experience of this struggle against the enemy. 5. In conjunction with the above work, land reform should continue to be promoted, in-depth inspections should be carried out, and a revenge and liquidation movement should be launched. Regarding fleeing landlords, Commissioner Wen stated: Our democratic government, in addition to resolutely suppressing those lawless landlords who brutally murdered the masses and committed numerous evils, will adopt a lenient policy towards general fleeing landlords; and hopes that they will return to the liberated areas, as long as they repent to the government, abide by the law, and engage in production with peace of mind, the government will guarantee the safety of their lives and property.

　　大名魏县收复区工作方针
    亲切抚慰受灾群众继续进行土地改革
    【本报冀南十四日电】新华社冀南分社记者顷以大名魏县收复区工作问题访问三分区政委焦善民同志暨温专员。焦政委称：此次魏、大所以能胜利坚持，其主要原因，是由于去年进行了土地改革运动，县区干部坚决执行了“县不离县、区不离区”的口号。目前魏、大收复区的主要任务，应是进行善后，恢复民主秩序。其中有两点值得特别注意：第一、必须足够的认识当前收复区部分群众的恐惧与埋怨情绪是暂时的而且也是必然的；我们必须耐心倾听群众意见，无条件的接受群众的正确批评，很好的进行挨户的慰问抚恤工作，只有使群众得到真实的温暖时，群众的情绪才会重新鼓舞起来。第二、恢复民主秩序要经过一个过程，应根据群众的迫切要求进行工作。目前在收复区应抓住以下几件工作：一、从深入调查研究蒋伪军的种种暴行中，以事实宣传教育群众，启发对蒋伪军的仇恨，提高斗志；调查中了解群众的迫切要求。二、坚决摧垮蒋伪秩序，号召伪组织人员向政府悔过自新。三、为解决群众生活与生产上的困难，专署特拨粮七十万斤，对难民进行救济，并安葬与抚恤英勇殉难的村干与军属。四、县区应认真的总结此次对敌斗争的经验。五、结合上述工作，应继续推行土地改革，深入大检查，开展复仇清算运动。对逃亡地主，温专员称：我民主政府除对那些惨杀群众、作恶多端的不法地主坚决予以镇压外，对一般逃亡地主一本宽大政策；并希望他们回到解放区来，只要向政府悔过，奉公守法，安心生产，政府将保障其生命财产的安全。（寒影）
