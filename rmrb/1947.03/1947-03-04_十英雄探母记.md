　　Record of Ten Heroes Visiting Their Mother
    To show we cannot forget our "mother," our ten comrades from the armed work team ventured deep into the enemy's rear, a place soaked in blood and tears. We reunited with our loved ones, the once-liberated peasants who are now suffering under the trampling feet of Chiang's army. Below are some excerpts from those reunions:

    I. Mother's Comfort
    "I see you're not any kind of army; you're just the Eighth Route Army!"
    Once the landlord recognized us as comrades from the armed work team, the old lady busied herself cleaning the house for us. The old man and the elder brother quickly went to the entrance to post sentries. After we entered the house, the old lady quickly brought three quilts, comforting us, saying, "Sleep well, don't worry."

    At dawn, the old lady woke us up, saying, "This house isn't secluded enough. The landlord's family lives right over by that window. Go to your third aunt's house!" So the old lady, cheerfully sweating, helped one person with their quilt, another with their bags. After everyone lay down to sleep, she looked around the room again, saying, "You all sleep well. No need for you to ask questions. Your elder brother and your uncle are watching outside, and I'm watching at the door."

    After a while, the landlord's elder brother rushed in, panicked, saying, "Wake up! Wake up! The enemy is coming! It's from the township office, only a dozen or so people." The old lady quickly relayed the message to us, and we waited quietly in the house for further reports. "They've gone past! They've gone to the head of the village to find the village head!" The old lady came to report the situation a second time. By then, it was already past breakfast time.

    The young second sister-in-law, standing in the courtyard, shouted loudly, "Mother, you have so many lice on you, let me scald them with hot water!" She was afraid that outsiders would see why her family was starting a fire at this hour, so she said this and went to make food for us.

    "There's something going on in the village; there's a fight. They're here to mediate. They've gone to the landlord's house up front, probably looking for something good to eat!" The old lady said, coming in for the third time. As the sun was setting in the southwest, the old lady brought a basket of cornbread and sweet potatoes, comforting us, saying, "Bear with it; we don't have any good food to eat."

    As darkness fell, we prepared to leave. The landlord's whole family was busy. The old man, the elder brother, and the second sister-in-law all went out to stand guard. The old lady was busy moving tables and stools. After we jumped over the earthen wall, she handed over the bundles one by one. This flurry of activity left the old lady gasping for breath. When we left, we gave the old lady four thousand yuan for the food, but she refused to accept it no matter what. "We didn't eat any good food; how could I take your money? From now on, we're family!" We were unwilling to eat her food for free, so we put the four thousand yuan on the floor, but it was taken out of the house again. After handing it back and forth six or seven times, she still wouldn't take it, so in the end, we had to secretly leave the money on her windowsill and leave.

    II. Tears and Hatred
    In the dark of night, we jumped into the courtyard of a peasant association member's home in ×× Village. After explaining that we were from the Eighth Route Army, his whole family got up and crowded into a small west room to see their loved ones.

    "Xiao Er, before it gets light, before that rooster crows, catch it. Tomorrow, go and buy some wine!" The peasant association member said this to his younger brother. Before he could finish speaking, Xiao Er was grabbed by us, saying, "We don't want those things!" The member said, "What's the point of keeping it? They'll end up eating it anyway, wouldn't it be better if we ate it?!" After a long argument, he finally went to make noodles.

    At this time, the member began to pour out his grievances. In the past, he had been allotted eight mu of land as a result of the struggle, but it was all taken back by the bad landlord. He was only given one hundred yuan of legal tender per mu, and the sorghum and beans in the field were also completely taken away by the landlord. The money received in the past was extorted by the landlord at a rate of "one penalty for every ten." The Kuomintang said they wouldn't levy taxes, but now they're already demanding three and a half jin of wheat, one jin of millet, one chi of white cloth, half a liang of cotton thread, one hundred yuan for dyeing fees per mu, and eight hundred yuan per month for miscellaneous expenses. Other things like the cost of repairing the deer barricades aren't even included. Finally, he said, "No matter what, it's hard to starve to death. As long as we don't starve to death, we'll wait and see! When the Eighth Route Army comes back, our day will come!"

    III. Waiting for the People's Army to Return
    On the eighth night, Comrade Wang walked into the courtyard of a rich peasant's home in ×× Village without making a sound. He felt his way to the bedside and gently touched the old gentleman's bearded face. The old gentleman sat up in fright: "Who is it?" Comrade Wang said, "I'm Director Wang!" The old gentleman, naked, grabbed Comrade Wang tightly, not saying a word, just sobbing. Comrade Wang's body was held tightly by him. Not knowing what to say, he felt a pang of sadness and began to cry as well. The room was filled with sobs.

    "Don't be sad, cover yourself with the quilt, let's talk slowly!" Comrade Wang said, suppressing his sorrow.

    "How did you come? I haven't slept a wink tonight, I was just planning to die!" the old gentleman said, choking with sobs.

    "Why do you want to die?"

    "I can't live anymore, those bad seeds have extorted me to the point where I can't live! A few days ago, those bad seeds found two foreign flour sacks in my house and fined me two hundred thousand yuan. My eight mu of land was also sold, and my calf was also sold... Now they want to fine me another three hundred thousand..." The old gentleman cried, unable to speak.

    Comrade Wang interrupted his sobbing and comforted him, saying, "Endure it slowly!" Then he told him about the victory in Juan'nan and our strategic guiding principles for mobile warfare, which rescued him from his grief.

    The old gentleman put on his clothes and went to call his son and daughter-in-law. He crouched under the wall and said in a low voice: "Director Wang is here, get up!" The old gentleman then said to his daughter-in-law: "Also, prepare the white flour for those bad boys tomorrow, go make noodles!" But Comrade Wang firmly refused.

    Comrade Wang continued the conversation, asking, "Who else are you inviting tomorrow?"

    "Because when they tied me up that day, my elder brother said, "Princes break the law, and everyone is treated equally," and they have to fine me another three hundred thousand. How can I live? I really can't live! I'll try to invite them to a feast tomorrow and see if they can reduce it a bit?" The old gentleman said sadly, "Since you left, I haven't slept. Every night when I hear the dogs barking, I get up to see if our troops have arrived. That night, I got up two or three times."

    "Ah!" The old gentleman sighed again and said, "When I saw you, I didn't want to die anymore! I've lived for seventy or eighty years and haven't seen such chaotic extortion and fines... Ah, if I could go back to being twenty years old, I'd be a fool if I didn't follow you!" (Reported by the Jilu Yu Branch)

　　十英雄探母记
    为了“母亲”不能忘怀，我们武工队十个同志，深入到血泪交加的敌后去，重会到了那被蒋军践踏得痛苦不堪的亲人——一度翻了身的农民们，下面是会见时的一些片段：
    一、母亲的安慰
    “我看你们啥队伍也不是，就是八路军！”
    房东认清了我们是武工队的同志，老太太就忙着给我们打扫房子，老大爷、大哥赶快到门口去放暗哨。我们进了房子后，老太太赶快送来三床被子，她安慰我们说：“你们好好的睡吧，不要紧。”
    天明了，老太太把我们喊醒，他说：“这屋子不僻静，窗户那边就是家地主，到你三婶子那屋里去吧！”于是老太太又快活的流着汗水，替这个拿被子，替那个拿包袱。大家睡倒后，她又到屋里看了一遍，说：“你们好好睡，用不着你问事，你大哥、你大爷在外边看着，我在门口看着。”
    一会儿，房东的大哥慌张的跑进来说：“醒醒！醒醒！敌人来啦，是乡公所的，只十几个人。”老太太忙来把话转告给我们，我们在屋里静静地等待着报告。“过去啦，上东头找庄长去啦！”老太太第二次来报告情况，这时已是吃过早饭的时候了。
    年轻的二婶子，站在院子里，高声喊：“娘，你身上那么多的虱子，我给你热水烫烫吧！”她怕外边看出了她家为什么这时候烧锅，说了这话，就去替我们做饭了。
    “这庄上摊事啦，有打架的，是来管闲事的，他们上前边地主家去啦，大概是想吃点好东西！”老太太第三次进来说。太阳西南时，老太太端着一筐子窝窝、红薯来，安慰着说：“受着点吧，咱没啥好饭吃”。
    天黑了，我们准备出发，这时房东全家都忙坏了，大爷、大哥、二嫂，都出去站岗，老太太忙着搬桌子凳子，我们跳过土墙后，她又把包袱一一的递过来，这一阵累的老太太直吁吁发喘。走的时候，我们把四千元饭钱给老太太，她无论如何不肯收。“没吃了好饭，还能要钱，往后咱就是一门亲戚啦！”我们又不甘心白吃她的饭，四千元票子放到屋里，又被从屋里拿出来，来回给了六七次，她无论怎样也不收，最后，我们只好偷偷的把钱放在她的窗台上走了。
    二、眼泪和仇恨
    黑夜，我们跳进了××庄的一个农会会员家里，说明是八路军后，他全家都起来拥到一间小西屋里去，看自己的亲人。
    “小二，趁天不明，别等那个鸡叫，逮住它。天明，再打酒去！”农会员对他弟弟这样说，他的话还未说完，小二被我们抓住了说：“咱不要那些事！”会员说：“留着干啥，也少不了叫他们吃，咱吃了不好吗？！”争执好久，结果才去打面条。
    在这个时候，会员诉起苦来，从前他分了八亩地的斗争果实，全被坏地主夺了去，一亩地只给一百元法币，地里的高粱、豆子，也完全被地主夺去了。过去得的钱，地主按“见一罚十”讹诈，国民党嘴说不征，现在已经每亩要了三斤半麦子、一斤小米、一尺白布、半两棉线、染钱一百元、每月还要零用费八百元，其他像修鹿砦费等，还不算在内。最后他说：“不管怎样，饿死人是很难的，只要饿不死，就等着看！等八路军回来，就有咱的日子啦！”
    三、等着人民的军队回来
    八日夜里，王同志走进××庄一家富农的院子，没有一点声响，摸到他床跟前，轻轻的在老先生长满胡子的脸上摸了一下，老先生惊骇的坐起来：“谁呀”？王同志说：“我是王主任”！老先生赤着身子，一把搂住王同志，嘴里一个字也没说出来，只是呜咽的痛哭。王同志的身子被他抱的紧紧的，不知说些啥好，一阵心酸，也哭起来，屋里充满了呜咽声。
    “你别难受，盖上被子，咱慢慢的说吧！”王同志抑止着难过说。
    “你怎来的？今夜我一夜没有睡着，才打算死去来！”老先生哽咽着说。
    “为啥要死呢？”
    “不能活啦，叫那些坏种讹的不能活啦！头几天，这些坏种在我家里翻出两个洋面袋子，罚我二十万花了，八亩地也卖啦，小牛也卖啦……现在又要罚我三十万……”。老先生哭的说不出话来。
    王同志打断他的痛哭，安慰他说：“慢慢的熬吧！”接着把鄄南胜利消息及我们运动战的战略指导方针告诉他，这才把他从悲哀中救出来。
    老先生穿上衣服，去叫他儿子和儿媳，他爬在墙根下小声的说：“王主任来啦，起吧！”老先生又对儿媳说：“还有，预备明天请坏小子们的白面哩，去擀面条去！”可是被王同志坚决的拒绝了。
    王同志接着这个话题，继续问下去。“明天又请谁？”
    “因为那天绑我时，俺大哥说了一句：“王子犯法，一律按罪”，非再罚我三十万不行，这还有啥活头，真不能活了！到明天请请客看，还能减点不？”老先生忧伤的说着：“从你走了，我没睡过觉，每天夜里一听见狗咬，就起来看看咱的队伍来了没有，那夜就起来两三回。”
    “哎！”老先生又长叹了一口气说：“我一见你，也不想死啦！我活了七八十岁，没看见过那么乱讹乱罚红眼啦，……哎，我要是去上二十岁年纪，不跟上你干是个鳖！”（冀鲁豫分社电）
