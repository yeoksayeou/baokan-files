Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: In the eight months of the Patriotic Self-Defense War (from July last year to February this year), the East China People's Liberation Army has annihilated over 280,000 Chiang troops, not including the achievements of local armed militia. According to statistics, out of the 281,661 Chiang troops annihilated, 115,048 were killed or wounded, and 166,613 were captured. If viewed in stages, the proportion of prisoners is increasing: from July to October, a total of 101,000 Chiang troops were annihilated, of which 57,140 were killed or wounded, accounting for 57 percent, and 43,860 were captured, accounting for 43 percent. However, from November to February of this year, out of the 180,661 Chiang troops annihilated, the number killed or wounded decreased to 57,908, accounting for 32 percent, while the number captured increased to 122,753, accounting for 68 percent. From the above statistics, it is clear that in the first four months, the number of killed or wounded was greater than the number of prisoners, while in the last four months, it has changed to more prisoners than killed or wounded. Furthermore, taking January and February of this year as examples, in January, out of the 55,000 [unclear number] hundred and twenty-four Chiang troops annihilated, 39,006 were captured, accounting for 70 percent; in February, out of the 73,150 Chiang troops annihilated, 59,650 were captured, accounting for 80 percent. This reveals a pattern, that is, the more Chiang Kai-shek's troops adopt a policy of focusing on concentrating forces and advancing side by side, the more they are annihilated. This is a powerful illustration of the People's Liberation Army becoming stronger and stronger, and Chiang Kai-shek's troops becoming weaker and weaker. At the same time, it also shows that no matter what methods Chiang Kai-shek adopts, he cannot save his already doomed fate.

    山东八个月歼敌廿八万敌越集中兵力被我歼灭越多
    【新华社华东廿六日电】华东人民解放军在八个月爱国自卫战中（去年七月至今年二月止）已歼灭蒋军二十八万余人，地方武装民兵战绩尚不在内。据统计，在被歼之蒋军二十八万一千六百六十一人中，毙伤十一万五千零四十八名，俘虏十六万六千六百一十三人。如分期观之，则俘虏比例愈来愈大：如七月至十月共歼蒋军十万零一千人，其中毙伤五万七千一百四十人，占百分之五十七，俘虏四万三千八百六十人，占百分之四十三。但自十一月至今年二月共歼之蒋军十八万零六百六十一人中，毙伤降低至五万七千九百零八人，占百分之三十二，俘掳则升至十二万二千七百五十三人，占百分之六十八。从上列统计数字明显看出，前四个月是毙伤多于俘虏，而最近四个月已转变为俘虏多于毙伤。再如以今年一、二两月为例，则一月份歼蒋军五万五千×百二十四人中，俘虏三九零零六人，占百分之七十；二月份歼蒋军七万三千一百五十人中，俘掳五万九千六百五十人，占百分之八十。这显示着一个规律，即蒋军越采取重点主义集中兵力齐头并进，则被歼灭越多。这便是人民解放军愈战愈强蒋军愈战愈弱的有力说明。同时，也说明不论蒋介石采取什么办法都不能挽救其已注定的失败命运。
