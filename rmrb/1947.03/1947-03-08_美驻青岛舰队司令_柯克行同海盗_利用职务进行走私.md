Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 6th - Not long ago, US Secretary of State Marshall declared that the continued presence of US troops in Qingdao was to "defend the Chinese coastline from piracy and smuggling." However, Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Seventh Fleet stationed in Qingdao, has recently been discovered to be a major "smuggler" engaging in "piracy" on the Chinese seas! On February 6th, American columnist Drew Pearson revealed Kirk's secret black market dealings in his "Washington Merry-Go-Round" column. Pearson stated: "While naval authorities are imprisoning privates for selling cigarettes on the Shanghai black market, admirals are getting rich. They can sell cars on the Shanghai market for as much as $8,200, use government money to transport them to Shanghai on landing craft, and use government radio stations to give priority to their business without anything happening to them." Pearson went on to list facts, stating: "Here is a series of almost unbelievable telegrams between Kirk and his friends regarding the sale of a car. Here are two of the telegrams. One is from Kirk to Major Conner, telling him: 'Car has been loaded onto Landing Craft 1141 from Okinawa and is being shipped to Shanghai. It left Okinawa on October 5th and should arrive in Shanghai around October 7th. You are instructed to return to Shanghai immediately after returning here. Your suggestion to add $700 in extras to the car is approved.' The other telegram is from Commander Sasser of the 1st Marine Air Wing to Kirk, telling him: 'Captain Connally is personally responsible for the shipment and suggests loading the car onto Landing Craft 1141 on October 6th. The exact shipping date is undetermined.'" Pearson stated: "Conner seems to be the person in charge of the Shanghai end of the deal, but he did not receive orders to stay in Shanghai, so he telegraphed Major Schuler in Shanghai from Qingdao to contact a car dealer in Shanghai. According to Schuler's reply to Conner, the Shanghai offer was $8,200 US dollars. However, he still felt this offer was not enough, even though most cars in America only sell for a fraction of that price. As a result, Conner again used public funds to telegraph Schuler, demanding $8,700. In the end, this price does not seem to have been accepted, and the offerer stopped talking about it. Therefore, the last message from Major Schuler ends with: 'We are all very unhappy.'"
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 6th - According to belated Shanghai newspapers, a Reuters dispatch from San Francisco on February 13th stated: About 1,400 US Marine Corps soldiers are scheduled to depart for the Pacific via Guam on the 14th. Some may still be sent to China, unaffected by the State Department's statement that it will soon withdraw US troops. According to a Marine Corps spokesman, a large number of the soldiers sent to China will be stationed in Qingdao, subordinate to the US Seventh Fleet. US troops stationed in Qingdao will remain after the withdrawal of US troops from other parts of China. The soldiers from Guam will depart from Pearl Harbor on the General Breckenridge ship. Families of US officers will also travel to Qingdao on the ship.

　　美驻青岛舰队司令
    柯克行同海盗
    利用职务进行走私
    【新华社延安六日电】不久以前，美国务卿马歇尔曾宣称：美军继续留驻青岛系为“防御中国沿海地带之海盗及走私行为”；但驻青美第七舰队司令柯克上将，最近却被人发现他就是在中国海面从事“海盗行为”的一个大“走私”者！上月六日，美国著名专栏作家德鲁·皮尔逊氏在“华盛顿轮转机”专栏中，揭露柯克利用职务进行黑市买卖之秘密。皮氏称：“正当海军当局对在上海黑市出售香烟的小兵加以监禁的时候，元帅们却发财了。他们可以在上海市场上以八千二百元美金的高价把汽车出售，可以花政府的钱用登陆艇运到上海，可以用政府的无线电台优先发电进行买卖，而不出任何事情。”皮氏继列举事实称：“这里是一连串几乎难令人相信的电讯，是柯氏和他的友人之间关于一辆汽车的出售的事情的。现在把两件电文载录下面，一封是柯克致康尼尔少校的，告诉他：‘汽车已自冲绳岛装上一一四一号登陆艇运沪，十月五日离冲绳岛，大致可于十月七日抵沪，兹授命你在回抵此间后即回上海。你建议在车上加七百元附加物，准予所请。’另一电是海军第一航空大队司令沙赛克致柯克的，告诉柯：‘康纳利上尉私人负责起运，他并建议在十月六日将汽车陌上一一四一号登陆艇，确切起运日期未定。’”皮尔逊称：“康尼尔似为这笔交易的上海方面负责人，但他未得到留在上海的命令，所以他从青岛致电上海的孝尔少校与上海一汽车商接触。根据孝尔给康尼尔的回电，上海方面的发价是美金八千二百美元。可是这一发价他还嫌不够，虽则在美国大多数的汽车只卖这价钱的几分之一。结果康尼尔又用公款致电孝尔，讨价八千七百美元。最后，这价钱似乎未被接受，而发价的人也不再谈了。所以，孝尔少校末一次电讯的结尾是：‘我们全都很不愉快。’”
    【新华社延安六日电】据迟到之沪报载联合社旧金山二月十三日电称：美海军陆战队士兵约一千四百名，定于十四日开往太平洋瓜代，一部或者仍将开往中国，不受国务院声明即将自撤退美军之影响。据陆战队发言人称：开往中国之士兵大批将驻留青岛，隶属美国第七舰队。青岛所驻美军在中国其他各地美军撤退之后仍将留驻，瓜代之士兵将自珍珠港乘“勃勒根里奇将军”号轮船出发，美军官之家属亦随船至青岛。
