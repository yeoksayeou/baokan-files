　　Should Co-education Be Implemented in Senior Primary Schools?
To the Editors:
　　Currently, some people advocate gathering all the female students in various regions' senior primary schools to establish separate girls' senior primary schools, arguing against co-education. They believe that co-education presents numerous inconveniences in terms of male-female relationships, teaching, homework, and daily life.
　　However, others disagree, arguing that co-education not only avoids these disadvantages in learning, homework, and daily life but, on the contrary, offers many benefits in male-female cooperation. In today's economically underdeveloped society, educational opportunities for girls are not as readily available as for boys due to the lingering backward ideology of valuing males over females. If girls have to travel long distances to attend school, families are likely to disapprove. Concentrating female students from various senior primary schools in one place would, in effect, impact the enrollment of seven or eight out of ten girls.
　　These two opinions are still being debated. Which one is correct? We hope you can provide an answer.

To Comrade Lin Guiqiao:
　　We forwarded your question to the Border Region Government's Education Department, and their reply is as follows:
　　We believe that the reasons Lin Guiqiao raised in favor of co-education in senior primary schools are correct. We would like to elaborate on two points:
　　(1) In a backward society, women are subjected to various forms of constraints and oppression, and this is also the case in education. The reasons against co-education, superficially, may seem not to disparage women's education, but in reality, they restrict women's access to schooling. They often stem from outdated perspectives, which are naturally incorrect.
　　(2) Co-education, both in theory and practice, is a problem that has long been resolved. Especially in the schools of the liberated areas, this has been the practice for several years. However, for some backward areas or newly liberated areas, some people still advocate for single-sex schools. The government does not force co-education but rather actively persuades and mobilizes, waiting for their awareness to increase before implementing co-education. This is the appropriate approach. Reply respectfully.

### 高小应否男女合校？

　　高小应否男女合校？编辑同志：
    现在有人主张把各个地区的高小女生，要集中在一起，单独成立女高，不要男女合校。他们认为那样，在男女生关系上，在教学、作业和生活上，都有很多不方便。
    但是有人不同意，认为在男女合校中，学习、作业和生活上，不仅没有坏处，相反的在男女的配合上，倒有很多好处。在今天这个经济还不够富足的社会环境下，女子求学还不能如男子容易，因为还残存着重男轻女的落后思想，如走上老远的路去求学，家庭一定不愿意，如果把分处在各个地区的若干高小的女生集中在一处学习，事实上就要影响十分之七八的女生辍学。
    上面两种意见还在争论，究竟那种正确，希即解答。
            读者林桂樵林桂樵同志：
    你问的问题，我们转问边府教育厅，承他们的答复如下：
    对林桂樵所提高小可以男女合校的理由，我们认为正确，仅稍申述两点：
    （一）妇女在落后的社会中，受着各方面束缚压迫，在教育问题上也是如此，这是个社会改革问题。不主张男女合校的理由，表面上似乎不轻视妇女教育，而实际是限制了妇女上学，多从旧的观点出发，那自然是不正确的。
    （二）男女合校在理论上、事实上是一个早已解决了的问题，特别是解放区的学校，几年来都是这样做的。不过对于部分落后地区或新解放区，还有些人主张男女分校，政府并不强制合校，而是在积极说服动员的条件下，待其觉悟提高后再合校，这是应有的工作态度。谨复。
