Ji-Lu-Yu Seven Regional Committee Directive:
    Implement Land Distribution During Guerrilla Warfare
    [Our newspaper from Ji-Lu-Yu, 10th] Comrade Wan Li, Secretary of the Seven Regional Committee, recently raised the following points at the County Secretary Preparatory War Joint Conference regarding the current guerrilla warfare and various tasks: First, in the current process of shifting to guerrilla warfare, some comrades have not yet been able to make the shift in their thinking. We must resolutely and thoroughly make the shift. The implementation of land reform has laid the foundation for guerrilla warfare, and we must continue to increase the enthusiasm of the masses for resisting Chiang and protecting their land. Second, there are currently three types of villages in various regions: one is a village where land and grain have been distributed relatively thoroughly, and ideological education and organizational work are well integrated, but there are relatively few such villages; one is where land and grain have not been completely distributed, and feudal forces have not been completely defeated; and one is where land reform is being brewed. The second and third types of villages are more numerous. If land reform cannot continue to be implemented during the guerrilla warfare, it will be difficult for the masses in the latter two types of villages to persist in guerrilla warfare. Therefore, land reform must be implemented. Third, it is necessary to strengthen the district position, which is an important link in adhering to guerrilla warfare. It can promptly grasp and promote village guerrilla warfare. Fourth, in terms of leadership, we must resolutely shift to guerrilla warfare and not harbor any侥幸 (jiǎo xìng,侥幸 means a fluke, a lucky chance, or侥幸心理 is the tendency to seek gains by luck) mentality. Maintain a strong core leadership, with the county secretary, county magistrate, and battalion commander together, and grasp the core armed forces to inspect and guide the work. Send some county cadres to the district to strengthen the work in the district.

　　冀鲁豫七地书指出
    游击战中贯彻分田
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】七地委书记万里同志，日前在县书备战联席会上，关于目前游击战及各种工作，提出以下几点：第一、目前转向游击战争的过程中，有些同志思想上一时还转不过来，必须坚决彻底的转。土地改革的进行，打下了游击战的基础，还必须继续提高群众反蒋保田的热情。第二、目前各地有三种类型村：一种是分田分粮较彻底村，思想教育组织工作结合的较好，但这种村比较少；一种是地和粮还未分得彻底，封建势力也未彻底打垮，一种是在进行土地改革的酝酿。二、三种村较多，如不能在游击战争中继续贯彻土地改革，后两种村群众游击战争也就难于坚持，因此必须贯彻土地改革。第三、要加强区阵营，这是坚持游击战争的重要环节，它能及时掌握与推动村游击战争。第四、在领导方面，要坚决转向游击战争，不存丝毫侥幸心理。保持有力的领导骨干，县书、县长、大队长在一起，并掌握骨干武装检查指导工作，派一部分县干部到区里，加强区里的工作。
