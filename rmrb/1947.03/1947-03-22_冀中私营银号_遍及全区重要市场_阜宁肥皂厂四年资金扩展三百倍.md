Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin-Cha-Ji] 20th: Private banks in the Central Hebei Region are found in all important markets. Before the July 7th Incident, there were over 90 banks in Hebei, with Central Hebei accounting for the majority. After the incident, almost all went bankrupt or changed professions. After the Japanese surrender, the democratic government actively supported the development of private banks. Last February, the Xinji Dazhong Bank first appeared, followed by Anguo's "Fusheng Gong," "Daxing Hao," and "Yujin Bank." By the end of last year, there were a total of 31 banks in the region. These banks were mostly privately owned and easily accessible to industry and commerce, leading to rapid business development. For example, when Dazhong Bank opened, its capital was only 1.17 million border currency, but by October it had increased to over 10 million. Statistics from 19 banks showed that the total amount of deposits and loans had reached over 20 billion border currency. Last July, Dazhong Bank averaged 16 million in loans per day, increasing to 40 million in August and 70 million in September.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: The Minsheng Soap Factory, a private enterprise in Yilin Town, southwest of Funing in Northern Jiangsu, has seen its capital expand 300-fold and its production increase 15-fold in the past four years, thanks to the support of the democratic government. Although cities such as Funing, Huai'an, and Lianshui are occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the factory is still operating as usual, and its products are selling well. According to Manager Du Xiaofu, the Minsheng Soap Factory was founded in 1943 with a capital of 38,000 yuan raised by him and other merchants in the town. At the time, it was experimental in nature, with only one small caustic soda pot, producing 100 bars of Minsheng soap per month. All raw materials for soap making, except for oils and fats, had to be imported from outside the Liberated Areas. The democratic government then encouraged the import of soda ash, and essential soap-making ingredients such as vanilla oil and "Three Pigeons Yellow" were imported duty-free. In 1945, soap was also exempted from sales tax, and now it is only taxed at 3%. Therefore, the factory's capital has now expanded to two large caustic soda pots, producing 1,500 bars of soap per month. In addition to Minsheng soap, it also produces a variety of other products, such as Johnson soap, Minsheng hygienic medicated soap, and Minsheng scented soap. Many nearby merchants come to purchase in bulk, and even many Shanghai merchants have come to visit, expressing particular admiration for the factory's ability to withstand the dumping of American goods and the oppression of bureaucratic capital.

    冀中私营银号
    遍及全区重要市场
    阜宁肥皂厂四年资金扩展三百倍
    【新华社晋察冀廿日电】冀中区私营银号遍及全区重要市常“七七”事变前，河北银号曾有九十余家，冀中即占其大半。事变以后几乎全部倒闭与转业。日寇投降后，民主政府即积极扶植私人银号发展，去年二月辛集大众银号首先出现，接着安国的“复盛公”“大兴号”“裕晋银号”先后开业，截至去年年关，全区已共有三十一家银号，各银号多为私人集股经营，与工商业易于融通，业务日益发展。如大众银号开张时资金仅边币一百十七万元，迄十月间即增至一千余万元，统计十九家银号的存放款总数，曾达边币二百亿元以上。大众银号去年七月每日平均放出一千六百万元，八月份增到四千万元，九月份则增至七千万元。
    【新华社华中十六日电】苏北阜宁西南的益林镇民营民生肥皂厂，在民主政府扶植下，四年来资金扩展三百倍，生产量增高十五倍，目前阜宁、淮安、涟水等城，虽为蒋军侵占，但该厂仍照常开工，出品畅销。据经理杜小甫先生告记者：民生肥皂厂系于民国三十二年由渠及本镇商人集金三万八千元所创立，当时为尝试性质，只有一口小号火碱锅，月产民生皂一百条，制皂原料除油脂外，都要从解放区外输入。民主政府便奖励碱粉进口，香草油、三鸽黄等制肥皂必须品，概免税进口。卅四年又准肥皂免税行销，现在亦不过征税百分之三，故该厂资本现已扩展至大号烧碱锅两口，月产肥皂一千五百条。出品除民生皂外，尚有强生皂、民生卫生药皂、民生香皂等多种，附近商人多来批购，甚至很多上海商人亦到此参观，对该厂能不受美货倾销及官僚资本压迫尤表羡慕。
