    Training Experience Since the Self-Defense War
    Military Region Headquarters
    Since the Self-Defense War, various corps have seized every available moment during lulls in continuous operations to carry out intensive training, achieving significant results and universally improving combat effectiveness. The preliminary experiences in training during combat over the past eight months are summarized below:

  (1) Utilizing Lulls in Combat for Training

    Within two or three days after the end of a battle, troops should be allowed to recover their strength (sleep, bathe, repair clothing, clean weapons, improve living conditions) and adjust their organization (form squads and platoons, assign cadres, replenish personnel, comfort the wounded, adjust weaponry). Then, a bottom-up combat summary should be conducted, with each individual to the squad, platoon, and even the entire column engaging in self-examination to discover and commend heroic deeds and model companies in combat. Any special skill should be praised, creating a wave of enthusiasm. This enthusiasm for reviewing combat should then be turned towards training, bringing the experiences from combat into training. Heroes, model individuals, innovators, and all active elements from combat should be used as leaders in training, and their creations and good actions in combat should be used as training subjects for universal learning.

  (2) Combining Combat and Training

    After each campaign summary, the lessons learned should be promptly applied to post-campaign training to adapt to the needs of the next campaign. In particular, the needs personally felt by soldiers on the battlefield should be the main content of training, which will easily boost learning enthusiasm and maximize effectiveness. When practicing movements, all requirements must be the same as in actual combat. For example, when practicing defense, all fortifications and obstacles (outer trenches, barricades, bunkers, etc.) should be built. The solidity of the fortifications should be the same as in actual combat. If the inspection finds that the solidity is not up to par, the fortifications must be rebuilt, ensuring that it is practical and serious. In offensive exercises, the steps of actual combat should also be followed, such as destroying barricades, passing through outer trenches, breaching bunkers, and engaging in street fighting. All movements should be practiced during the day and also frequently at night. Subjects practiced at night (such as digging fortifications) should be inspected and reviewed during the day for authenticity. Many subjects should be trained using experimental methods to verify their effectiveness (such as the explosive power of explosives). In addition, when learning enthusiasm is high, slogans related to combat can be put forward, such as "Learn good skills to annihilate the × army" as a basis for the next combat mobilization.

  (3) The Mass Line in Training

    1. Mutual Aid Groups: Based on an understanding of the troops' situation, squads should be systematically organized into mutual aid groups (two or three groups per squad, three or four people per group). When forming the groups, different elements should be mixed together, so that veteran soldiers can lead group members with their exemplary role, newly liberated soldiers can use their skills, and new soldiers can easily learn. The squad leader leads his squad's groups while also being a group member. They join the group to learn skills that are not as good as others. Platoon leaders, deputy platoon leaders, and branch secretaries not only guide training but also automatically participate in weaker groups to learn.

    2. More Rewards, Less Criticism, Active Elements Taking the Lead: All cadres participating in learning groups should take the lead in learning, become models of observing learning discipline, and listen to the training of the squad leader or group leader, truly achieving the mass line of soldiers teaching officers, soldiers teaching soldiers, and officers teaching soldiers. When conducting a specific technical training, grades should be recorded at any time to check and evaluate the progress of each individual and squad/platoon. Conduct commendations, convene hero meetings, merit meetings, elect heroes and models, and encourage learning and exchange of learning experiences. Those who make the fastest progress, even if their grades are not necessarily the best, or those who make the most effort to help others should also be commended. As for those with poor grades and slow progress, the group or squad/platoon should review the reasons or improve their methods. In short, cadres should adopt this leadership method of less criticism and more encouragement to inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and help them from ideological transformation to learning progress. After learning enthusiasm is mobilized, each group and squad/platoon can automatically formulate its own learning plan, emulate those with good grades, and enter into revolutionary competition. At this time, each group and squad/platoon will fear falling behind, and they will automatically try their best to work hard in extracurricular activities, at night, and even in the middle of the night, creating an unstoppable wave of learning.

    3. Creating Typical Examples: In the process of training, cadres should conduct in-depth investigation and research, use Zhuge Liang-style symposiums, collective reports (usually by platoon, with squad leaders, group leaders, and outstanding performers participating), understand the technology of the entire platoon, exchange experiences, and calculate and register scores. From the bottom up, discover models. Under the unanimous approval of the masses, typical individuals or units can be selected, and this typical example can be used to educate the whole, in order to influence other companies to launch training movements.

    4. Utilizing the Skills of Newly Liberated Soldiers: In addition to transforming their thinking and making them recognize the essence of the people's army, newly liberated soldiers can be encouraged and consolidated by utilizing their skills. In the training movement, according to their different skills (mostly good combat movements, ability to use new weapons, digging fortifications that meet requirements, providing cover and rest, and facilitating the deployment of firepower), they can be hired by the company as temporary instructors of various techniques. During the time they are responsible for the course, all cadres and soldiers treat them with the attitude of a teacher to encourage them to promote their skills, and at the same time can influence the learning enthusiasm of the entire company and promote new heroism.

  (4) Unified Leadership and Mobilization

    The mobilization work for training should be combined with the mobilization work for combat and the merit campaign. The political work and Party work during the training period are the political work and Party work for training. All work revolves around the central task of training, all for the purpose of improving combat effectiveness, physical strength, and foot strength to meet new battles. All personnel are involved in the wave of training, wholeheartedly focusing on training the troops well.

    自卫战争以来的练兵经验
    军区司令部
    自卫战争以来，各兵团利用连续作战空隙，抓紧一切可利用的时间突击练兵已获重大成绩，战斗力已普遍提高。现将八个月来战斗中练兵的初步经验摘要介绍如下：
  （一）利用战斗空隙练兵
    在一个战斗结束后的二、三日内令部队恢复体力（睡眠、洗澡、修理服装、擦拭武器、改善生活）和调整组织（编班、编排、配备干部、补充兵额、慰问伤员、调整武器），接着便应进行自下而上的作战总结，从每个人到班排乃至全纵队进行自我检查，以发现和表扬战斗中的英雄事迹，模范连队，即一技之长均应表扬，造成一种热潮，接着便把检讨战斗的热潮转向练兵，把战斗中的经验带到练兵中去，利用战斗中的英雄模范者、创造者及一切积极分子，做为练兵中的带头分子，把他们在战斗中的创造和好的动作，做为练兵中的课目普遍学习。
  （二）战斗与练兵结合
    每次战役总结后，应将所得经验及时运用到战役后的练兵中去，以适应于下次战役的需要，特别是把战士在战场中亲身感觉的需要，做为练兵的主要内容，则学习情绪即易高涨，收效也最大，在演练动作时，一切要求须与实战相同，例如：演习防御便做好一切工事和障碍（外壕、鹿砦、地堡等），其工事巩固的程度要求和实战时一样，倘经检查认为坚固程度不合的工事即须重做，务须做到切实认真；在进攻的演习中，也按实战步骤破坏鹿砦，通过外壕，破击地堡，登城巷战等实施之，一切动作在白天演习后，要多在夜间演习，在夜间演习的课目（如挖工事）要于白天检查讲评，以资真切，许多课目应用实验方法来训练，以证实它的效果（如炸药的爆破威力），另外在学习情绪高涨时，可以提出有关战斗的口号，如“学好技术来歼灭×军”，以做下次战斗动员的基础。
  （三）群众路线的练兵
    一、互助组：根据对部队情况的了解，有计划的将各班编成互助小组（每班二、三小组，每组三、四人），在编的时候，把不同的成份配合起来，这样老战士以模范作用领导组员，新解放战士可发挥他的技术，新战士便于学习。班长一方领导本班的小组，同时也是组员。编入小组学习某些不如别人的技术，排长、副排长、支书，一方指导训练，同时也要自动的参加到比较薄弱的小组内学习。
    二、多奖励少批评、积极分子带头：一切参加学习小组的干部，均应在学习中起带头作用，成为遵守学习纪律的模范，听从班长或组长的教练，做到真正兵教官、兵教兵、官教兵的群众路线，在进行某一技术训练时，应随时登记成绩，以便检查和评定各人及班排的进度。进行表扬，召开群英会，立功会，选举英雄和模范，鼓励学习交流学习经验，进步最快。但成绩未必最好的，或帮助别人最努力的亦应提出表扬，至于成绩差，进步慢的则让组内或班排自己检讨原因，或改良方法。总之干部均应采取此种少批评多鼓励的领导方法，以启发群众的积极性、创造性，帮助他们从思想的转变到学习的进步。学习情绪发动后，各小组及班排即能自动的订出自己的学习计划，向成绩好的看齐，而进到革命竞赛，这时各小组班排恐睢落后，多在课外、晚上以及半夜自动想尽办法加紧苦练，造成一种不可阻止的学习浪潮。
    三、创造典型：在练兵过程中，干部应进行深入调查研究，利用诸葛亮座谈会，集体汇报（通常排为单位，班长、组长、成绩优秀者参加），了解全排技术，交流经验，结算登记成绩，从下而上发现模范，在群众一致批准的条件下，可选出典型人物或单位，抓着这一典型教育全体，以影响其他连队展开练兵运动。
    四、利用新解放战士之技术：对待新解放战士除改造其思想，使之认识人民军队的本质外，在利用他的技术上也可鼓励他和巩固他，如在练兵的运动中，根据他们的不同技术（多半是战斗动作好，对新武器会用，挖工事合乎要求，有掩盖能休息，便于发扬火力），以连队名义聘为各种不同技术的临时教员，在他担任的课程时间内，一切干部及战士都以对教员的态度对待他，以鼓励他发扬他的技术，同时可以影响整个连队学习情绪，提倡新英雄主义。
  （四）一元化的领导和动员
    练兵的动员工作要与战斗的动员工作和立功运动相结合，练兵期间的政治工作和党的工作就是练兵的政治工作和党的工作，一切工作围绕着练兵这一中心任务，一切为着提高战斗力和体力、脚力迎接新的战斗，一切人员卷入练兵的热潮，全心全力把兵练好。
