    Methods of Planting Indigo
    Wu'an County is a place where indigo is planted very well. Below are the indigo planting experiences I recorded from an old farmer in Wu'an, for reference by indigo planters in various regions.
  I. Sowing
    The method of sowing indigo seeds is to do it one or two days after Qingming. When sowing, first water the field. After an hour, when the water has seeped into the soil, then sow the seeds. After sowing, immediately cover with three finger-widths of fine soil. After six or seven days, the indigo seeds will sprout. At this time, the original three finger-widths of fine soil should be thinned by one and a half finger-widths, to make it easier for the sprouts to emerge from the soil.
  II. Transplanting
    After sowing, when the indigo seedlings have grown to about eight inches above the ground, around the time of Xiaoman (Lesser Fullness of Grain), dig up the seedlings and transplant them. When transplanting, the tops of the seedlings should be aligned (not the roots). If the tops are aligned but the roots are not, the longer roots can be curled up in the soil, so that the indigo plants will grow to the same height and not overshadow each other. The best density for planting is 600 "kilns" (clusters) per fen of land. Each "kiln" can have seven or eight seedlings. After planting, if the weather is not dry, there is no need to water them; if there are no weeds on the ground, there is no need to hoe them.
  III. Fertilizing
    Fertilizing is usually done about twenty days before the start of the sanfu (hottest period of summer), when the indigo seedlings have grown as big as broomcorn. The method of fertilizing is to separate the indigo seedlings by hand and place the fertilizer in the middle of the plant. Generally, indigo is fertilized with dregs from sesame oil pressing. The best fertilizer is the hooves of livestock, because the hooves of livestock are the most nutritious and suitable for nourishing the indigo. After fertilizing, if the weather is dry, water them once; if it is not dry, there is no need to water them.
  IV. Harvesting
    Knowing when to harvest is crucial. If you harvest too early, the indigo seedlings have not absorbed all the fertilizer and have not grown strong enough. If you harvest too late, the indigo's color will be shriveled. Generally, indigo is harvested about twenty days after fertilizing. Do not pay attention to the size of the indigo seedlings. It is important to know that the size of the indigo seedlings is not very important; the main thing is to look at the quality of the indigo's color.

    种蓝的方法
    武安县是种蓝种得很好的地方，下面是我记录一个武安老农口述的种蓝经验；以供各地种蓝参考。
  一、种
    种蓝的方法，下种籽是在清明后一二天，下籽时，先浇上水，过一小时，等到畦面的水渗入地下时才下籽。下籽后，立即盖上三指深的细土。再过六七天，靛籽便会生出芽来，这时，就应将原来盖上的三指深的细土，去掉一指半厚，让芽容易长出土面来。
  二、栽
    种后，等到靛苗长出离地面八寸高后，约在小满时节，便把靛苗挖起来移栽。栽时，要将靛苗的头顶端对齐（不是把根对齐），如将上面的苗头对齐了而苗根不齐时，则可把长的苗根卷齐窝在地底下，使将来靛苗的身子长成一样高，谁也不霸谁。栽的稀密，最好是一分地栽六百窑为宜。每一窑里可栽七八个苗子。栽上后，如天不旱，不用浇水；地面没有荒草时，也不用锄它。
  三、上肥
    上肥料的时候，大半是在入伏前的二十天左右，要在靛苗长的象扫帚苗一样大了，就是上肥的时候。上肥的办法，是用手将靛苗搬开，把肥料放进苗株的中间，一般种靛是用大麻饼的油渣子作肥料，最好的肥料是用牲口的蹄腕，因为牲口的蹄腕肥最肥最合的垫靛的滋养。上肥后，如天旱，就浇它一遍，如不旱就不用浇水。
  四、割
    什么时候该割，掌握这一时机最要紧。因为割早了，靛苗没吸完肥料，还没长壮，割迟了，靛的色气就干瘪了。一般割靛是在上肥后二十天左右。切不要看靛苗长的大小。须知靛苗的大小是没多大关系的，主要是看靛的色气的好坏。
