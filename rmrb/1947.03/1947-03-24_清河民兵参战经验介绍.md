Introduction to the Qinghe Militia's Wartime Experience
    苑洪波

    (I) Two tasks before concentrating in the county:
    1. After the district armed forces committee receives the order from the county, it should plan the villages for the distribution of cadres and personnel, and after the plan is made, notify the village cadres who should go on the expedition and the squadron cadres responsible for the village to come to the district for a meeting. The content: First, the task and time (make it clear). Second, discuss and agree on the distribution of squadron cadres, village cadres, and the number of people in each village. Third, prepare all the items to be carried (rifles, bullets, grenades, rice bags, quilts, etc.). Only by holding meetings with squadron cadres and village-level cadres can problems be solved at the meeting, the responsibilities of cadres clarified, and the sense of responsibility of cadres increased, so that the assembly can be rapid when the time comes.
    2. Compile well in the district: When assembling in the district, before coming to the county, the district armed forces committee must properly compile the organization of platoons and squads according to the specific situation of quality, weapon quality, and cadre strength, and then come to the county for assembly, so as to avoid organizational chaos and sporadic problems when arriving at the county.
    (II) Work after concentrating in the county:
    1. Smooth out thinking: When the militia concentrates in the county, the county can convene the heads of each district to report on the militia's negative thoughts and problems; at this time, the militia's negative thoughts and actions can be summarized, combined with the political situation and current tasks, and a thought-provoking report can be made at a general meeting, so that each group can discuss and reflect, in order to smooth out thinking and improve morale.
    2. Challenge: After the mood is stable, convene another general meeting of the militia. The content: First, summarize the conclusions of the group discussion; second, announce the conditions for model militia and reward methods; third, call on everyone to challenge, compete, and take oaths, and then the groups discuss, individuals versus individuals, squads versus squads, platoons versus platoons, and companies versus companies find objects for mutual challenge. The results of the challenge should be summarized and passed to form everyone's resolution.
    3. Establish various organizations and various systems: First, organize an economic committee. According to the number of people, establish economic committee organizations in each village. The establishment of this organization can be done by the militia electing it. Task: Master the supply system and improve life within the system. Second, the entertainment committee can also be a company unit led by people who are interested in entertainment through democratic election by the militia to lead everyone's entertainment. Third, system: Establish a reporting system, a review system, and clear regulations for work and rest time from top to bottom.
    After the above work is done, set off again (it takes about two days).
    (III) From the beginning to the end of the task:
    1. Seize the gaps for rectification and training. In the process of participating in the war, whether it is cooperating with the front or the rear, there must be gaps. Seize this gap to carry out rectification and training. The content: "Situation," "Tasks," "Mass Work," "Password Q&A," "Advance and Retreat," "Sentry Duty Instructions," "Air Defense," "Turning Steps"... Study or practice according to actual needs. Only by combining with reality can we improve the militia's enthusiasm for learning.
    2. Recording good and bad work - During the work, the squad leader will hold a meeting every night to record the good and bad things of each comrade. For example: how many times have you talked to the masses, swept the yard for the landlord, carried water, and fed the cattle...etc.; bad things such as scolding the masses, eating the masses' things...etc. are also recorded in the account. This has a great effect on understanding the situation and encouraging the militia's morale.
    3. Deal with problems promptly:
    In the work of participating in the war, regardless of the contradictions within the militia or the violations of mass discipline, they should be dealt with quickly and without delay. The longer the time, the greater the problem will develop; at the same time, the militia (or squad platoon) with excellent work achievements should also be commended and rewarded in a timely manner to improve morale. For example: During this participation in the war at the end of the year in Yunzhuang, Renping (the residence of the miscellaneous troupe Yun Maozai), a squad of a company caught four chickens from the masses. They had just prepared to cook them when the brigade headquarters discovered it, detained the squad leader for two hours of reflection, and held a full company meeting to deal with it. As a result, the chickens were returned. The squad was severely criticized at the militia meeting, and the entire company was very satisfied.
    4. Handling of spoils:
    After a battle, the spoils must be properly handled. Generally, the spoils can be handled in two ways:
    The first is weapons, rifles, machine guns, bullets, etc. Whoever captures them will be given appropriate material rewards (reward as many people as there are); in addition, it is best to let whoever gets the guns bring them back to their villages for use (if there are many guns in the village, they can be transferred to other villages) in order to encourage their morale. However, a note must be given to the county to prove that it is not the private property of the village, and grenades and other things can be brought back to the village for use, but must not be sold privately, and should be public weapons for the village. (Large quantities are exceptions)
    The second type of spoils is scattered items obtained in cleaning the battlefield, such as a military uniform, coat, etc. Whoever gets them must also be properly handled during the summary; it should be resolved democratically based on group discussions.
    5. Inspection:
    Before the end, gather everyone together for a major inspection of mass discipline. When doing this work, the significance of the inspection must be explained, the masses' thinking must be smoothed out, and then an inspection committee must be organized to conduct mutual inspections to avoid misunderstandings and dissatisfaction with the leadership.
    6. Election:
    Take a day off before disbanding to conduct model work elections. During the election, each squad selects one candidate based on the amount of credit and model conditions, and conducts a general bean vote. The more serious the form, the greater the significance.
    7. Summary:
    At the final disbandment, hold a summary meeting to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of participating in the war and point out the direction for the future. At this meeting, party and government leaders should be invited to give instructions and reward models.

    清河民兵参战经验介绍
    苑洪波
    （一）未集中到县前的两件工作：
    １、区武委会接到县之命令后，即计划好干部及人数分配的村庄，计划好后，通知应出征村干及其负责该村之中队干部来区开会。其内容：一、任务及时间（讲明确）。二、中干、村干及各村人数分配谈好。三、一切携带物件准备好（大枪、子弹、手榴弹、米袋、被子……等）。只有召开中队干部及村级干部会议，有什么问题即在会议上解决，明确干部责任，加重干部之责任心，到时集合才能迅速。
    ２、在区编制好：在区集合起，未向县来时，区武委会必须将班排之组织，根据质量好坏、武器优劣、干部强弱等具体情况，编制妥善，再来县集合，以免到县时组织混乱，光闹零星问题。
    （二）集中到县后的工作：
    １、打通思想：民兵集中县时，县可召集各区负责人汇报民兵不良思想及发生的问题；这时可将民兵不良思想行动总结起来，结合政治形势及当前任务召开大会做一启发性的报告，使各小组讨论反省，以便打通思想，提高情绪。
    ２、挑战：情绪稳定后，再召开全体民兵大会。其内容：一、总结小组讨论结论；二、宣布模范民兵条件及奖励办法；三、号召大家挑战，竞赛宣誓，然后小组讨论，个人与个人、班与班、排与排、连与连自找对象，进行互相挑战。挑战的结果应当总结通过，形成大家的决议。
    ３、建立各种组织及各种制度：一、组织经济委员会，根据人数多少，每村各建立经济委员会组织，该组织的产生，由民兵推选即可。任务：掌握供给制度，在制度内改善生活。二、娱乐委员会也可以连为单位由民兵民主选举对娱乐有兴趣的人领导大家娱乐。三、制度：自上而下建立汇报制度，检讨制度，作息时间要有明确规定。
    以上工作作好后，再行出发（约需用两天时间）。
    （三）任务开始到结束：
    １、抓住空隙进行整训，在参战工作过程中，不管是配合前方也好、后方也好，一定是有空隙的，抓住此种空隙，可以进行整训。其内容：“形势”“任务”“群众工作”“口令问答”“前进后退”“岗哨须知”“防空”“转法步法”……根据实际需要进行学习或演习，只有结合实际才能提高民兵的学习热情。
    ２、好坏工作记账——在工作当中班长每天晚上开会时，将每个同志的好坏事都记住。例如：给群众谈话几次，给房东扫院子担水喂牛……等；坏的骂群众、吃群众的东西……等也记在账上。这对于了解情况及鼓励民兵情绪作用极大。
    ３、发现问题及时处理：
    在参战工作中，不管民兵内部的矛盾或破坏群众纪律，均应迅速处理，不应迟延，时间长问题就越发展越大；同时对工作成绩优良之民兵（或班排）也应及时表扬奖励，以便提高情绪。例如：年底这次参战在荏平之云庄（杂团云茂才住地）一连的×班捉了群众四只鸡，刚弄好正要下锅做，被大队部发觉了，将该班长扣起反省了两个钟头，开全连会议处理，结果将鸡退回。在民兵大会上将该班作了严格批评，全连反映都很满意。
    ４、缴获物的处理：
    一次战役结束后，必须将缴获之物品适当处理，一般缴获物，可分两种办法处理：
    第一种是武器，大枪机枪子弹等类的东西，谁缴获的给以适当物资奖励（几个人就奖几个人）；另外所得之枪支谁得的最好叫他带回本村使用（如该村枪支较多可调剂给他村）以便鼓励其情绪。但必须给县打条子证明不是他村私有，手榴弹类、东西，可带回本村使用，不许私卖，应为村子公共武器。（大批例外）
    第二种缴获物，是在打扫战场中所得之零星物品，例如：一身军装大衣等，谁得的，到总结时也要适当处理；根据小组讨论，民主解决。
    ５、检查：
    临结束时，将全体集合在一起，对群众纪律来一大检查。做此工作时必须将检查的意义讲明，打通群众思想，再组织检查委员会，进行互相检查，以免发生误会，对领导不满。
    ６、选举：
    解散前抽一天时间，专门进行选举模范工作。选举时，各班根据功劳多少及模范条件，每班选候选人一人，进行全体投豆选举，其形式越严肃意义越大。
    ７、总结：
    在最后解散时，开一总结会议，总结参战之优缺点与指出今后方向，在此会上应邀请党政民负责人训话，并奖励模范。
