Four Sisters Offer Birthday Greetings
　　·Collaboration by Han Sai, He Chi, and Hu Ke·
　　甲: I'll say it, I'll say it! (Singing the tune of "North Wind Blows")
　　丁: Honestly, your man is a cook! Hmph! You can't forget about cooking!
　　甲: You little brat! All you do is run your mouth!
　　老: Eldest daughter's idea is good, people are iron, food is steel, you can't fight a victorious battle without eating!
　　甲: Dad! Let me drink! (About to drink)
　　乙: (Stopping her) Big sister, don't rush! I have a good way to support the front!
　　老: You wait a moment! Listen to your sister first!
　　乙: (Singing the tune of "North Wind Blows") Planting cotton, spinning cotton,
　　Weaving white cloth and dyeing it,
　　Making military uniforms and sewing shoe soles,
　　Dense stitches like sesame seeds;
　　Comrades, climbing mountains and crossing rivers,
　　Our rear is for them.
　　Put a letter in the military uniform,
　　Tell him to bravely kill the enemy.
　　丁: Him! Him! You can't forget him! Hmph!
　　乙: Oh! Who is it?
　　丁: Your Zhang company commander!
　　乙: You little brat! I'm not talking about him! I'm talking about the one wearing the clothes!
　　丁: Haha! Zhang company commander doesn't wear clothes? Fighting naked?
　　乙: (Angry) Even if he's naked... no! no! I'm talking about the one wearing the clothes I made! You little brat!
　　老: Enough! Enough! Whoever it is, it is! If it's Zhang San, it's Zhang San, if it's Li Si, it's Li Si!
　　乙: (Hitting the old man) Dad! Dad! You're helping her talk, no way! I have to drink! (About to drink)
　　丙: (Stopping her) Wait a minute! Hmph! I have an even better way!
　　老: Right! Right! The eldest daughter wants the front to eat well, the second daughter wants the front to dress well, what is the third daughter's way of supporting?
　　丙: (Singing the tune of "North Wind Blows")
　　When the army comes, vacate the house,
　　I wash clothes for the comrades,
　　In winter, I heat the warm kang for the comrades,
　　In hot weather, I cook mung bean soup;
　　Comrades, coming and going,
　　We help with grain and grass,
　　Comrades live in our village,
　　Just like returning to their hometown.
　　老: Good! Good! The third daughter's idea is not bad, letting the army live well, the idea is strong!
　　丁: Hmph! The idea is good, the idea is strong, there is one person carrying a machine gun!
　　丙: You are a thorny bramble! You are the king of thorns! You are both good and strong! (Chasing her) You little brat!
　　老: Enough! Enough! All are good! Dad is not good!
　　丙: Then it's my turn to drink! (About to drink)
　　丁: (Stopping her) Oh! Wait a minute! The best idea is still to come!
　　老: Then fourth daughter, you also sing a section!
　　丁: You listen! (Singing the tune of "North Wind Blows")
　　Left hand a basket of big eggs,
　　Right hand a bag of fine white flour,
　　A sheep's belly towel tied on the head,
　　Happily going to the front line;
　　Say hello to the comrades,
　　And feed the wounded tea and rice,
　　Comrades eat the comfort items,
　　Guaranteed to make Chiang Kai-shek perish early.
　　老: Good! Good! Let the comrades at the front be mentally happy, and also express our people's intentions! When the comrades are happy, they will kill three or five hundred more stubborn soldiers!
　　丁: This time it's my turn to drink! (About to drink)
　　丙: (Stopping her) Let's have a discussion! Wouldn't the Eighth Route Army freeze if they didn't live in houses? My idea is better! Vacate the warm house.
　　乙: The Eighth Route Army can't do without clothes! Let Dad say it!
　　甲: The Eighth Route Army can't do without food! My idea is better! Dad! What do you say?
　　老: (Thinking for a while) Good! All good! (Counting clappers)
　　The four daughters spoke well, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are also good,
　　Everyone's idea is very good, eat well, dress well, live well, be in good spirits;
　　The rear supports well, the front fights well,
　　Fights well, fights wonderfully, fights really great,
　　Reactionaries, can't escape, sooner or later we will eliminate them, eliminate them.
　　(White) What do you think? I think so! All are good, all drink!
　　甲: Dad! You only say our ideas are good, how do you support the front, tell us four sisters too!
　　老: (Laughing) Ask me? Ginger is spicier when it's old, an old general going into battle is worth two. You listen: (Singing the tune of "Sour Jujube Thorns")
　　Five cups of wine, pour them first,
　　Listen carefully to Dad's words,
　　Sending letters, leading the way, carrying stretchers,
　　The old man must love the country even more. Chorus: Everyone, drink a glass of wine,
　　Wish us a great victory,
　　The front and rear work together,
　　Enjoy glory and wealth soon. (Drinking)
　　(Loud gongs and drums)
　　四女: Listen! (Singing the tune of "Sour Jujube Thorns")
　　(Background singing)
　　老: (Continuing to sing) Daughters, follow me,
　　Follow me out of the village to take a look.
　　(Gongs and drums circling the stage)
　　丁: (Singing) The big mule, five feet tall,
　　Pulling the big cannon forward.
　　丙: (Singing) The cannon sounds, booming,
　　Defeating the Chiang troops and enjoying peace.
　　乙: (Singing) The soldiers are in high spirits,
　　The three-eight rifle has a bayonet.
　　甲: (Singing) The cadres carry boxes,
　　Protecting the border area with great merit.
　　众: (Chorus of "Sawing the Big Vat", i.e., "Nailing the Vat" tune)
　　What a great team of people's soldiers,
　　Going to the front to fight the stubborn troops,
　　One by one truly heroic,
　　Team after team with great prestige,
　　Soldiers and the common people,
　　Unite and do not relax,
　　Good fellow villagers and good brothers,
　　Resolutely eliminate the invading army.
　　老: Stop singing! The army is coming, don't even say go and comfort them! Take the chickens and meat you gave me with you!
　　众: Right! Let's go comfort them! (Each holding gifts, they leave together)
　　老: (Looking at the daughters leaving, talking to himself) Hehehe! These girls!
　　(Blowing the door tune "Sour Thorns")
　　Girls, truly inseparable, number one progressive elements,
　　Since childhood, they have been naughty, and they can't change their old habits when they grow up.
　　I, the old man, am happy, and I had a truly fulfilling birthday.
　　This play is over, please give me your opinions.
　　(Bows and exits)

    乙：（唱《北风紧》调）种棉花，纺棉纱，
    织成白布又染了它，
    做军装又把鞋底子纳，
    密密的针线赛芝麻；
    同志们，爬山过水，
    咱们后方为了他。
    军装里塞上一封信，
    叫他勇敢把敌杀。
    丁：他！他！你就忘不了他！哼！

    向同志，问声好，
    再给伤员喂茶饭，
    同志们吃了慰劳品，
    管叫蒋介石早完蛋。

    谁的办法都挺好，吃好穿好住好精神好；
    后方支援好，前方打的好，
    打的好，打的妙，打的真是呱呱叫，
    反动派，跑不了，早晚叫咱们消灭了，消灭了。
    （白）你们看怎么样？我看这么着吧！都好，都喝酒！
    甲：爹！你光说我们办法好，你又是怎么样支援前线，也说给我们姐儿四 个听听呀！
     老：（笑哈哈地）问我么？姜，是老的辣，老将出马，一个顶俩。你们听 着：（唱《酸枣刺》调）

    开上前方打顽军，
    一个一个真英勇，
    一队一队好威风，
    子弟兵来老百姓，
    团结起来不放松，

    众：对！咱们去慰劳吧！（各持礼品拥下）
    老：（望众女下，自语）嘿嘿嘿！这丫头们！
    （吹过门《酸刺刺》）
    丫头们，真不离，进步分子数第一，
    从小儿，就淘气，长大改不了旧脾气。
