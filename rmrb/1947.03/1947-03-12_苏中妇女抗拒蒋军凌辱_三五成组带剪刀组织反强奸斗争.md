　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th—Infuriated by the bestial acts of Chiang's troops, women in Rudong County (eastern Rugao) in Central Jiangsu have launched an organized anti-rape struggle. Incomplete statistics from just a few villages, such as Julai and Juzhuang in the county, show that over a hundred women have been raped, more than twenty are unable to get out of bed due to the assaults, and eight have died after being gang-raped. Even the wife of the Kuomintang-appointed Baozhang (local leader) of Baigong Township, Miao Heting, and the wife of the landlord Miao Bolun, were brutally gang-raped to death by ten of Chiang's soldiers. When Chiang's troops were raping a fourteen-year-old girl in Juzhuang, she shouted "Help!" from inside the room. Her ten-year-old younger brother immediately grabbed a pitchfork and stabbed the Chiang's soldier painfully. As the Chiang's soldier was about to flee, he was met by an old woman with scissors who rushed over and angrily cursed: "It's you beasts who are harming people!" The Chiang's soldier was so frightened that he scurried away with his head in his hands. In a certain place along the Ru (gao)-Jue (gang) line, when a Chiang's soldier attempted to rape a pregnant woman, she immediately wrestled with him, broke his nose, and then quickly reported him to the militia. The Chiang's soldier failed in his rape attempt and was instead captured alive by the militia. This kind of victory news immediately spread among the masses, further developing into organized struggles. Now, groups of three to five women are forming small groups, all carrying weapons such as scissors. If one is raped, the group collectively uses their weapons to fight the Chiang's troops. In one city alone, four thousand women have joined this struggle.

　　苏中妇女抗拒蒋军凌辱
    三五成组带剪刀组织反强奸斗争
    【新华社华中八日电】苏中如东县（如皋东部）妇女在蒋军兽行激怒下，爆发了有组织的反强奸斗争。该县据余来仅据高庄等数村不完全统计，被强奸妇女即达百余，被奸不能起床者二十余人，被轮奸身死者八人；连百宫乡蒋记保长缪鹤庭之妻、地主缪伯伦之妻，亦惨遭十个蒋军轮奸致死。当蒋军在高庄强奸一十四岁女孩时，她在房内高喊“救命”，其十岁的幼弟即拿铁叉痛戳蒋军，蒋军正要夺门而出，又遇一拿剪刀的老太太冲来怒骂：“就是你们这群畜牲害人！”蒋军吓得抱头鼠窜。如（皋）掘（港）线上某地一蒋军想强奸一孕妇时，她即与蒋军扭打，打破蒋军鼻子后又急报民兵；蒋军强奸未遂，反被民兵生俘。此种胜利消息立即在群众中传开，进一步发展为有组织的斗争。现三个五个妇女成立一小组，均身藏剪刀等武器，一人遭到强奸，就集体用武器与蒋军作战。某一市即有四千妇女卷入这一斗争。
