Taigu Pingchuan militia retreated to the mountains after the Yan puppet army's "flood" offensive in July of last year. Some formed armed work teams, some were called home-guarding teams, and some operated independently in their original organizational forms. After the rectification and training at the end of last year and in January of this year, they have improved in both organization and ideology. During the political offensive around the Lunar New Year, mass meetings were widely held in villages in the Pingchuan area within three miles of the enemy. Slogans deceiving people by Yan Xishan were scrubbed off, and our slogans were written on, and leaflets and "Return Home Certificates" were sent to Yan army strongholds, greatly shaking the Yan army in various strongholds, who asked people to find militiamen to get "Return Home Certificates." Through the efforts and propaganda of the militia, 104 people came over. The militia adopted irregular methods of activity, such as going out early and returning late, or going out late and returning early, advancing into Pingchuan; now there are militiamen everywhere and at all times. The Yan army of 30 to 40 people in Yangyi dare not leave the village; the Yan army in Shangzhuang, as soon as they leave the village, use skirmishing formations, rising and falling, falling and rising, daring not to advance straight.

The development of guerrilla warfare in Taigu Pingchuan, the Ying regiment truly played a role in supporting the militia, and the militia itself had organizational forms and leadership methods adapted to guerrilla warfare. 1. The organizational form of the militia is based on the principle of "advancing to the enemy's rear and facing their own villages." The X and X districts are organized into detachments according to the joint defense groups that have not been withdrawn. Those who can return to the village return to work, and those who cannot return are responsible for guarding. If they advance to the enemy's rear, the militia of the stronghold villages and the surrounding villages will contact their own villages by finding acquaintances and sending letters. After the enemy in Baiyan and Xiaobai was defeated in the Xiaobai battle in X district, the two militia armed work teams in X district were divided into four, forming two groups according to the original joint defense, and went deep into the vicinity of the strongholds to carry out work in their own villages; the villages that had been liberated were dispersed to their own villages to mobilize the masses. The militia truly acted as both soldiers and workers. In one team in X district, the militiamen could all return to their villages, but they could not stay for long. After being dispersed, the strength was not enough to be allocated, so they adopted a method of rotating village activities, today in Village A and tomorrow in Village B. One team in X district could all return to the village and had strength, but could not stay overnight, so they adopted a method of living together and carrying out activities in different villages. 2. Collective leadership, division of labor and responsibility, must achieve concurrent posts and powers. In the X and X districts, the district organizes the militia armed work team headquarters, with the district head serving as the captain, the director of the armed committee as the deputy captain, and the political commissars of the basic team as the political commissars. The captains of each detachment are concurrently held by the armed committee and the government cadres, and the instructors are concurrently held by the sub-committees. The cadres and militiamen live together, which also overcomes the tendency to engage in systems or the militia not being led by others. District cadres who do not have concurrent posts form working groups with the withdrawn village cadres to specifically study issues such as propaganda and organization. The selection of responsible persons for each team pays attention to the relationship with the militiamen in each village: they must be familiar, have prestige, be able to solve the actual problems of the militiamen, and regularly give lessons, read newspapers, and explain policies. 3. Except for individual villages, most of the militia in Pingchuan withdrew to the mountains, and some of their families also withdrew to the mountains, so the livelihood problems of the militia and their families need to be solved. Each district organized a militia production department and a militia family production department. The family production department in the Sixth District used ten stones of rice borrowed from the district office as a fund to set up weaving. The militia stipulated a system of taking turns returning to the production department to take care of their relatives, and special personnel gave lessons and taught literacy, greatly stabilizing the morale of the militia.

　　挺向敌后面向本村的太谷平川民兵
    霍衡文
    太谷平川民兵于去年七月阎伪军“水漫”进攻之后撤至山上，有的组成武工队，有的叫保家队，有的依原来组织形式单独活动。经过去年年底与今年一月份的整训，在组织上，思想上均已提高。旧历年关的政治攻势，普遍在平川区离敌人三里地的村庄召开群众大会，刷洗阎锡山的骗人标语，写上我们的标语，给阎顽据点内送传单，荣归证，引起各据点的阎军大大动摇，托人找民兵要荣归证。经过民兵的争取、宣传，跑过来一○四人。民兵采取了早出晚归，晚出早归等不定时的活动办法，挺向平川；现在是处处有民兵，时时有民兵，阳邑阎军三、四十人不敢出村；上庄阎军一出村就用散兵阵势，起来伏倒，伏倒起来，不敢直进。
    太谷平川游击战争的开展，营兵真正起了给民兵撑腰的作用，民兵本身则有了适应游击战争的组织形式和领导方法。一、民兵的组织形式是根据“挺向敌后，面向本村”的方针而变化。×、×两区按照未撤出的联防组成分队，能回村的回村工作，不能回村的担任警戒。如向敌后挺进，据点村与周围村的民兵即以找熟人、捎信等方式和本村取得联系。在×区小白战斗后，白燕、小白的敌人被打垮了，×区的两个民兵武工队划为四个，依原来联防组成两个集团，深入据点附近，开展本村工作；已经解放的村子，则分散到本村发动群众。民兵真正做到了既是兵又是工作员，×区有一个队，民兵都能回村，但都不能长久，分散之后，力量又不敷分配，则采取了轮村活动办法，今天在甲村、明天到乙村。×区有一个队都能回村，也有力量，但不能住夜，则采用了集中生活，分村活动办法。二、集体领导、分工负责，必须做到兼职兼权。×、×两区，以区组织民兵武工队大队指挥部，由区长兼队长，武委会主任兼队副，基干队正、副政委兼政委，各个分队的队长由武委会和政权干部兼，指导员由分委兼，干部和民兵生活在一起，这样也克服了闹系统或民兵不受别人领导的偏向，没有兼职的区干部，则和撤出的村干部组成工作组，专研究宣传、组织等工作问题。各队负责人的人选，都注意到和各村民兵的关系：要熟习、有威信，能解决民兵的实际问题，经常给上课、读报、讲解政策。三、平川的民兵除个别村外，大部撤到山上，有的家属也撤在山上，所以民兵与家属的生活问题都需要解决。各区即组织民兵生产部、民兵家属生产部，六区的家属生产部，以区公所借给的十石米做基金，筹办纺织。民兵中规定了轮流回生产部照看亲人的制度，并有专人给上课、教识字，大大安定了民兵情绪。
