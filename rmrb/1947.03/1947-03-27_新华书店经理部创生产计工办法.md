    【Our Newspaper Dispatches】The Xinhua Bookstore Manager Department's production team completed one-quarter of the year's production task in one month. The entire team consists of nine people, with only seven regularly at home. They mainly focus on grinding flour and batting cotton, while also engaging in transportation, vegetable cultivation, spinning, hairdressing, ink production, and assisting collective production. From February 10th to March 16th, over 35 days, they produced 558 catties of millet, exceeding their individual quotas by 108 catties, and created a suitable scoring method. Due to the diverse nature of production methods, both price-based and time-based scoring methods were adopted. The price-based method involves converting daily production income into millet based on the market price, with one point awarded for every catty of millet's worth. If the income is from collective production, points are divided equally among the people, while also recording the earned cash amount in the income column. The time-based scoring method awards one point for every hour of labor, which is very convenient for utilizing time, as the value of one hour of labor is approximately equal to one catty of millet. If a certain type of production has high profits, then the first scoring method is used. This provides reasonable consideration for those with strong labor power and also stimulates the enthusiasm and creativity of team members.

    新华书店经理部创生产计工办法
    【本报讯】新华书店经理部生产小组，一个月已完成全年生产任务四分之一。全组共九人，经常在家的只七人，以磨面弹花为主，以运输、种菜、纺纱、理发、制墨水、辅助集体生产，从二月十日到三月十六日卅五天内，生产小米五百五十八斤，除每人交任务外尚余一百零八斤，并创造了适当的记分办法。由于生产方式的多种多样，所以采取了记价记时两种办法。记价的办法是把每日生产收入，按市价折合成小米，值一斤米就记一分。若是集体生产所得，就按人平均记分，同时在收入栏内记下所赚现金数目。按时记分办法是劳动一小时就记一分，对利用时间上有很大方便，因一小时的劳动价值约等于一斤米。若某种生产利润大，则按第一种办法记分。这样一面对劳动力强的给以合理照顾，同时也发挥了组员的积极性和创造性。
