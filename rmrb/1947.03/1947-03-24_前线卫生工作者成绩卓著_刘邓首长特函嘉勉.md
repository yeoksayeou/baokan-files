    Frontline Health Workers Achieve Remarkable Results
    Liu and Deng Send Special Letter of Commendation
    [Report from the JiluYu Front, this newspaper, 22nd] Liu, Deng and other leaders recently sent a letter of commendation in recognition of the remarkable achievements of frontline health workers. The original letter is as follows: “Dear Comrades in health work: You have made tremendous efforts in the self-defense war, and have done the most valuable work for the frontline soldiers. You have worked day and night, painstakingly and resolutely completing your tasks. Under the leadership of Minister Qian Xinzhong, you have adopted new therapies, enabling a large number of brave wounded people's fighters to be discharged from the hospital in a very short period of time. This is your great achievement. We hope that you will continue to work hard, adhere to the spirit of serving the people, work more conscientiously and carefully, strive for excellence, overcome difficulties and shortcomings in your work, and launch a campaign to earn merit, in order to cooperate with the front lines to strive for the early arrival of the counter-offensive. With the salute of the people's liberation! Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Jichun, Li Da."
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 18th] Medical personnel of a certain column of the New Fourth Army are conducting battlefield treatment with great enthusiasm and skill, and are launching a campaign to earn merit. In a certain battle, a platoon leader was injured, his carotid artery ruptured (note: this is a fatal injury site for any animal), and blood shot up to a foot high. Surgeons Fan Dihong, Chen Yaohan, etc., quickly sutured the rupture in his carotid artery with a rapid treatment surgery, and then removed the bullet. About ten days later, the platoon leader's wound began to heal, and his neck was gradually able to move. According to Fan, Chen, etc., "No wound can defeat us, even if it is a napalm wound, we can quickly treat it." On February 4th, merit evaluations were conducted, and thirteen medical personnel, including Wu XiongRong, who once bandaged and carried fifty-six wounded soldiers on his back, have been added to the list of merit.
