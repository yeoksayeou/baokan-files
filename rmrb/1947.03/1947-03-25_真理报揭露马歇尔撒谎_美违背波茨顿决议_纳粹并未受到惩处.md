    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. TASS reports: A _Pravda_ observer recently wrote a commentary on Marshall's previous speech at the Foreign Ministers' Conference regarding the denazification and democratization of Germany, stating: In theory, empty rhetoric about democracy is of no help in solving practical problems. In the western occupation zones of Germany, especially the American zone, both theory and practice violate the Potsdam Agreement. In theory, Marshall demands that freely formed parties have the right to free elections, but in practice, in the American-occupied Bavaria province, democratic parties are discriminated against. The law promulgated in Bavaria stipulates that those who receive less than 10% of the vote cannot participate in parliament, with the result that democratic parties have no proper representation in parliament. Marshall advocates the rights of unified trade unions, but in reality, the policy of the British and American occupation authorities is to split the all-German trade union movement and hinder its consolidation. The denazification in the American zone also contradicts theory and practice. According to the Control Commission's report, as of January 1st this year, the American zone had released 44,244 members of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and secret police, and the British zone had released 34,000. As of January 1st, only 710 people in the American zone had been convicted of opposing peace, while in the Soviet zone, there were 14,240. Based on these figures, this cannot be considered a normal situation. The British and American occupation zones' wholesale pardon of former Nazis, SA members, and secret police personnel is the reason for the widespread unrest that has recently been revealed in the British and American occupation zones. These facts all indicate that the democratization in the British, American, and other western occupation zones has not been satisfactory, let alone completed.
    [Our Newspaper] TASS, Moscow, 18th. The Soviet Trade Union's newspaper, _Trud_, international commentator Shudin, recently wrote an article entitled "German Trade Unions and the Elimination of Nazi Remnants," stating: When the Foreign Ministers' Conference discusses the issue of eliminating Nazi remnants and democratizing Germany, it should be noted that the German Trade Union has more than 7 million members, of which 3.5 million are in the Soviet occupation zone. Therefore, the Soviet occupation zone is the pioneer of Germany's new democratic movement. The reason why the work of eliminating Nazi remnants can be effectively carried out in the Soviet occupation zone is that German workers and government officials united under the democratic trade union have participated in this work. The exclusion of trade unions in the western occupation zones from participating in the cleansing work has delayed the progress of the work of eliminating Nazi remnants and has created various shortcomings. Marshall and Bevin have tried their best to deny the indisputable facts cited by Molotov, and they have tried to find reasons to show that the German Trade Union is satisfied with the progress of the work of eliminating Nazi remnants, but the facts are the opposite. At the meetings of trade unions in various occupation zones, the representatives of the western regions did not conceal their dissatisfaction with the slow progress of the work of eliminating Nazi remnants. Many trade union leaders in the British and American occupation zones have repeatedly expressed their dissatisfaction with the delay and hesitation in carrying out political cleansing work. Shudin concluded that the trade union has the right to participate in the work of eliminating Nazi remnants and that it is their duty.

    真理报揭露马歇尔撒谎
    美违背波茨顿决议
    纳粹并未受到惩处
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社讯：真理报观察家顷著文评论马歇尔前此在外长会议上关于德国非纳粹化与民主化的讲演称：在理论上关于民主的空论对于解决实际问题是没有帮助的，在德国西部占领区特别是美占区，理论与实际都同样是违背波茨顿决议。在理论上，马歇尔要求各自由组成的党派有权自由竞选，而实际上在美占区的巴伐利亚省，民主党派却受到歧视。在巴伐利亚颁布的法律，规定获选票不及百分之十者不得参加议会，以致民主党派在议会中无适当代表权。马歇尔主张统一的职工会的权利，但实际上英美占领区当局的政策却是分裂全德国的职工运动，并妨碍其巩固。美占区的非纳粹化也是理论与实际相矛盾的，根据管委会的报告，截至今年一月一日止，美占区释放的冲锋队和秘密警察达四万四千二百四十四人，英占区三万四千人，至今一月一日止，美占区只有七百一十人因反对和平获罪，而苏占区则有一万四千二百四十人。根据上面这些数字来看，不能承认这是正常的情形。英美占领区整批的赦免前纳粹分子、冲锋队、秘密警察人员，这就是最近透露出的英美占领区广泛发生骚乱的原因，这些事实都指出英美及其他西部占领区的民主化做得不能令人满意，更谈不上说是已经完成。
    【本报讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日电：苏联职工联盟机关报——劳动报——国际评论员舒丁，顷以《德国职工联盟与清除纳粹残余》为题写道：外长会议讨论德国清除纳粹残余及民主化问题时，应当注意德国职工联盟拥有七百余万会员，而其中有三百五十万在苏联占领区内。因此，苏联占领区乃德国新民主运动之先导。清除纳粹残余工作能在苏联占领区内有效进行，其原因之一就是团结在民主职工联盟之下的德国工人、及政府机关人员，已经参加了这种工作。西部占领区职工联盟被排斥参加清洗工作，结果使清除纳粹残余工作之进行延缓下来，并产生了种种缺点。马歇尔及贝文竭力否认莫洛托夫所引证的不可争辩之事实，彼等力图找寻理由说明德国职工联盟满意清除纳粹残余工作之进行，但事实却与此相反。在各占领区职工联盟会议上，西部地区之代表们，并未隐瞒其对清除纳粹残余工作迟迟进行之不满，英美占领区的许多职工团体领袖，曾对政治清洗工作进行之延缓与踌躇，反复表示不满。舒丁结语称：职工联盟有权要求参加清除纳粹残余工作，且为彼等之职责。
