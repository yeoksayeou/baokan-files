    In Areas Harvesting Two Crops a Year, Golden Queen Corn Can Also Be Planted
    Xingtai Agricultural Bureau Exchanges Planting Experiences
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Xingtai Agricultural Bureau recently held an agricultural technology training class to share planting experiences with Golden Queen corn. It was mentioned that in the past, some people believed that Golden Queen corn was only suitable for areas that harvested one crop a year, and that it wouldn't work to plant it in areas that harvested two crops. Therefore, it has not been widely promoted in areas that harvest two crops a year for several years. Last year, after the First District Agricultural Bureau was established in Xingtai, in addition to calling for it at the Labor Hero Conference, they also conducted comparative tests of planting it on their own farms and with local corn. Under the same conditions, Golden Queen yielded 422 jin per mu, while local corn only yielded 330 jin per mu. Golden Queen yielded 92 jin more per mu, an increase of 28% over local corn. The growing season was only slightly longer - 99 days for local corn and 113 days for Golden Queen. Harvesting it did not delay planting wheat. An Jiuren, a labor hero from Xiaoxi Village in Neiqiu, planted wheat stubble corn last year (the wheat yielded one dan per mu), and Golden Queen yielded five dan per mu, while local corn yielded two dan. In Li Jia Yao, Xingtai, Golden Queen corn generally averaged 4.5 dan per mu, while local corn averaged two dan.
    Experience from various places has proven that Golden Queen is also very suitable for planting in areas where two crops are grown annually, and the yield is still quite high. An Jiuren said, "Planting one mu like this, including wheat and corn, is enough for two people to eat for the whole year." (The above examples are all from irrigated land.)
    The experience of planting two crops in dry land in Bailujiao, Neiqiu, has also yielded good results. Harvesting corn does not delay planting wheat, but there are not many examples of this. If you are afraid of temporary lack of rain, you can intercrop it in the wheat field early, which will make the two-season harvest in dry land more secure.

    [This newspaper dispatch] The Taihang Second Administrative Office Agricultural Technology Training Class graduated on March 8 and has returned to various counties to conduct small-scale agricultural technology training. The method of this training class is mostly a combination of scientific theory and practical experience, and a combination of classroom learning and field learning (such as what kind of soil is suitable for various crops). During the 20 days of study, a total of eight types of problems were studied. For example, in planting cotton, comrades from Yushe reported that they planted it every year, but didn't harvest much. After this study, they discovered many past problems and actively learned from Yu Tai Qi students with cotton planting experience, realizing the importance of technology. This training laid a favorable foundation for the promotion of special crops and the improvement of technology this year.

    收两季庄稼地方同样能种金皇后
    邢台农林局交流种植经验
    【本报讯】邢台农林局在最近召开的农业技术训练班里，交流金皇后玉茭的种植经验，谈到过去有人认为金皇后玉茭只适合种全年收一季庄稼的地方，收两季的种上不行。因此几年来在种两季庄稼的地方，没有得到大量的推广。去年一分区农林局在邢台成立后，除在劳英大会号召外，又在自己农场种植和本地玉茭作了比较试验，在同一条件下，金皇后每亩产四百廿二斤，本地玉茭只产三百卅斤。金皇后每亩多收九十二斤，比本地玉茭增产百分之廿八。只是生长期略长一些——本地玉茭九十九天，金皇后一百一十三天。收割以后，还不耽误种麦。内邱小西村劳动英雄安九仁，去年种的麦茬玉茭（麦子每亩收了一石），金皇后每亩打五石，本地玉茭打两石。邢台李家窑一般金皇后玉茭平均收四石五斗，本地玉茭平均打二石。
    从各地的经验证明，金皇后在全年种两季庄稼的地方种植，也是很合适的，产量还是相当的高。安九仁说：“像这样种一亩，连麦子带玉茭足够两个人全年吃。”（以上例子都是水地）
    内邱白鹿角旱地种两季的经验，收成也很好，割了玉茭也不误种麦、但这例子还不很多，如果怕临时没雨，可早在麦田里套种，这样旱地两季收的更保险。

    【本报讯】太行二专署农业技术训练班，于三月八日毕业，已分返各县进行小型农技训练。这次训练班的方法多是科学理论与实际经验相结合，课堂学习和田间学习相结合（如各种作物，适宜何种土壤）。二十天学习中，共研究了八种类型的问题，如种棉花，榆社同志们反映说，每年种上，收不多。这次经过学习，才发现了过去很多毛病，积极向种棉有经验的榆太祁学员虚心学习，认识了技术的重要。这次训练对今年推广特种作物和技术提高上，奠定有利条件。
