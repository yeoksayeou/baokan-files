Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: The US government's announcement of long-term agricultural "cooperation" between the US, China, and the Philippines has been described by people here as another shameful crime by Chiang Kai-shek to ruin the nation's foundation and the people's livelihood. From this, it can be seen that China has been regarded by the United States as an agricultural zone like its colony, the Philippines. According to a dispatch from the US Information Service in Washington on the 25th, the US Department of Agriculture announced that China and the Philippines have accepted the "assistance" of US agricultural experts. The report on the "improvement" of agriculture in China and the Philippines, where experts from both countries are working, includes various recommendations. The report was approved by the US government in advance and has now been published in the three countries. The delegation that drafted this plan consisted of personnel dispatched by the State Department and the Department of Agriculture, as well as agricultural technicians from China and the Philippines. They stayed in China and the Philippines for several months last year and formulated a "long-term plan to improve agriculture in China and the Philippines." According to the summary of the report of the Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Group, which was published by the Central News Agency on February 24, its central spirit lies in developing China's agricultural export products to supply the United States with industrial raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: Shanghai News: A US agricultural delegation has come to China again. The group of nine arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo on the 22nd of last month. On the 24th, the Chiang government officially announced the "China Agricultural Construction Plan" drafted by the delegation. The delegation is part of the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" and came to China in June last year to "inspect Chinese agriculture." They returned to the United States in November and submitted the above-mentioned plan to the US-Chiang government. The plan advocates the establishment of an agricultural control bureau, the development of export agricultural products, chemical fertilizer plants, etc. It also stated: "Originally, it was hoped that some of the above-mentioned suggestions could be the beginning of future agricultural cooperation between China and the United States." Its purpose is to control Chinese agriculture and turn China into a complete American colony. The delegation's return to China this time is to carry out the task of participating in the plunder of Chinese agriculture.

    美农业考察团再度来华
    【新华社延安一日电】美国政府公布美中菲农业长期“合作”一事，被此间人士称为蒋介石断送国脉民命的又一可耻罪行。于此可见中国已被美国当作它的殖民地菲律宾一样的农业地带。据美国新闻处华盛顿二十五日电，美国农业部公布中菲两国已接受美农业专家“协助”。在两国专家工作之中国及菲律宾农业“改进”报告内，包括各种建议。该报告事先是已获得美政府批准，现已在三国公布。拟定该项计划之使团，系由国务院及农业部派遣之人员及中菲两国农业技术人员共同组成，彼等大年曾在中菲两国内勾留数月，并拟定“改善中菲两国农业之长期方案”。按中美农业合作团报告的提要，已经中央社在二月二十四日发表，其中心精神在于发展中国农业的外销品，供给美国以工业原料。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】沪讯：美国农业考察团再度来华，一行九人已于上月二十二日由东京飞抵沪。二十四日，蒋政府正式发表该团所拟“中国农业建设计划”。该团系“中美农业技术合作团”组成部分之一，曾于去年六月来华“考察中国农业”，十一月返美，并将上述计划交美蒋政府。该计划主张设置农业管制局，发展外销农产品，化学肥料厂等。并称：“本来希望上述建议的若干事业可为将来中美两国农业合作之肇始。”其目的在控制中国农业，使中国变成十足的美国殖民地。该团此次再度来华，即为执行参与掠夺中国农业的任务。
