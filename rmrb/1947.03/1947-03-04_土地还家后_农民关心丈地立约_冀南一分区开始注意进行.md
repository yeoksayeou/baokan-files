[Report from our newspaper in Jinnan on the 2nd] After liquidation in Wuxun's Fengduanwang Village, attention was paid to carrying out the necessary procedures for "land returning home," such as surveying, contracting, and tax deeds, which further increased the enthusiasm of the farmers. During the anti-traitor and grievance campaign in the village, 158 mu of land were recovered, and Wangzhuang donated 69 mu to the village's farmers' association, totaling 227 mu. During this major inspection, all the land was distributed to 53 peasant households, and new contracts were drawn up. Feng Liandeng, after being allocated six mu of land, said happily, "I'm forty years old, and I've been working hard all day long, saving every penny, but I haven't had a single piece of land. Now I've been given six mu of good land, and the document is in our hands, so I can rest assured that the land will always be ours." Then he happily handed the document to his child and said, "This is the land Chairman Mao gave us, never forget Chairman Mao's kindness." However, many places still do not pay enough attention to this work, only calculating the list of how much each household should receive, and the farmers have not yet realized that the land has truly returned home. For example, an old man in Yongzhi Tianzhuang said, "They all say that I've been allocated six mu of land, but it hasn't been given to me yet. Who knows where the land is?" The First Prefectural Committee has now instructed all county committees to pay attention to this work.

　　土地还家后
    农民关心丈地立约
    冀南一分区开始注意进行
    【本报冀南二日电】武训冯段王村经过清算后，注意进行丈量、立约、税契等“土地还家”必经手续，农民热情更加提高。该村反奸诉苦时，追回土地一百五十八亩，并有王庄赠送该村农会六十九亩，共地二百二十七亩。在这次大检查中，全部分给五十三户农民，立了新契。冯连登分六亩欢喜的说：“我活了四十岁啦，成天起早搭黑省吃俭用也没有一分地，现在我分了六亩好地，文书拿在咱手里，可以放下心了，地永远是咱的了。”随又高兴的把文书递给他的小孩说：“这是咱毛主席给咱的地，永别忘毛主席的恩。”但目前尚有许多地方对此项工作注意不够，只是算出谁家应分的数目清单来，农民还没有想到土地真正回家。如永智田庄有个老头说：“都说分给我六亩地，可是至今未给我，谁知道地在那里？”现一地委已指示各县委注意这一工作。
