　　[This dispatch from the Taihang Mountains, 5th] Xiuwu's emancipated peasants in the Anshangbian village of the Second District enthusiastically participate in the militia, actively defending their hometown with arms. In the past two months, they have operated behind enemy lines thirty times, capturing more than ten traitorous bullies, burning down thirteen enemy blockhouses, cutting down more than 150 catties of electrical wire, and persuading more than 700 people in enemy-occupied areas to return. The people of Anshangbian village, in a wartime environment, couldn't get salt, so the militia stood guard at the river ditch village hilltop, the village opened a market, and exchanged salt with people from the enemy-occupied areas. Under their protection, the village has suffered no losses since the Jiang army occupied northern Henan. During the New Year, the villagers cut meat, cut tofu, and invited the militiamen to eat, with the old men happily saying, "You are truly our own children!"
    [News from this newspaper] In the forty days from January 1st to February 10th, our Bo'ai Local Corps and the militia took the initiative to attack behind enemy lines, creating brilliant results, totaling over three hundred battles, annihilating 161 Jiang and puppet troops, disintegrating 32 enemy soldiers, seizing one machine gun, twenty rifles, five pistols, sixty livestock, reaping over a thousand catties of electrical wire and many other spoils of victory, exceeding the original plan to eliminate the enemy and achieve meritorious service by more than four times.
