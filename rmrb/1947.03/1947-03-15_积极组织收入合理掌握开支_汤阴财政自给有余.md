　　Actively Organize Revenue, Rationally Control Expenditures
    Tangyin Achieves Fiscal Self-Sufficiency
    [This newspaper, Tangyin news] Since the occupation of Hebi, Loulou, and other places by the pseudo-Sun Dianying troops in November of last year, most of the county's one hundred and eleven administrative villages, except for five, have been reduced to stubborn occupation areas and guerrilla zones (fifty villages have now been recovered), and the financial situation is very difficult. Under these circumstances, the democratic government adopted the policy of "actively organizing revenue and rationally controlling expenditure," achieving fiscal self-sufficiency with a surplus. The methods are as follows: 1. Liquidate concealed materials, enrich production funds, expand production, and increase income. After clearing, the livestock seized and confiscated by various districts in the past, except for those retained for personal use, amounted to thirteen heads of livestock, equivalent to 500,000 yuan. In addition, 200,000 yuan of production funds scattered in various departments of the county government were unified in the Linxian Hejian to establish a freight station to develop transportation. Tax personnel were drawn out to personally control the leadership. From December of last year to the end of February of this year, a profit of 900,000 yuan was obtained. 2. War-seized materials, except for military supplies, are divided equally between the government and those who seized them as a reward. This not only takes care of the combat morale of the troops and militia but also increases government revenue. In four months, a total of twenty-two head of livestock and fifty-five sheep were seized. After deducting the rewards, the government revenue was 800,000 yuan. The above two items totaled 1.7 million yuan in revenue, which solved the expenses of 400 militiamen, refugees, etc., and also opened a wartime small hospital, printed war zone newspapers and leaflets, and launched a killing contest in conjunction with the propaganda offensive. 3. To solve the lives of evacuated people, the policy of "organizing production for self-relief, taking specific care from the actual situation" was adopted, so as to achieve less expenditure and satisfactory solutions. For example, in taking care of the lives of refugees, after review and democratic discussion, it was decided to replace what was missing. The county has filled a total of 3,681 feet of cloth, 617 pounds of cotton, and 600 people, with each person having less than five feet of cloth. When issuing relief grain, 1,394 refugees received less than seven taels of rice per person per day. Two-thirds of the cotton cloth and grain were resolved by the refugees' production. Forty-four refugees were evacuated from General Mu's tomb, and each person earned 42 kilograms of rice, solving their living difficulties and achieving self-sufficiency.

　　积极组织收入合理掌握开支
    汤阴财政自给有余
    【本报汤阴讯】汤阴自去年十一月伪孙殿英部抢占鹤壁、鹿楼等地后，全县一百一十一个行政村，除五个村外，大部沦为顽占区与游击区（现已收回五十余村），财经十分困难。在这种情况下，民主政府采取了“积极组织收入，合理掌握开支”的方针，做到了财政自给而有余。其办法有如下三点：一、清算埋伏物资，充实生产基金，扩大生产，增加收入。经过清理，将各区过去缴获没收之牲口，除留自己使用者外，计收回牲口十三头，合洋五十万元。又将县府各科分散之生产基金二十万元，统一于林县合涧成立货站，发展运输。抽出税收人员，亲自掌握领导。从去年十二月到今年二月底，获利九十万元。二、战争缴获物资，除军用品外，政府得一半，奖励缴获者一半。这样既能照顾部队民兵战斗情绪，又可增加政府收入。四个月共缴获牲口二十二头，羊五十五只，除提奖外，政府收入八十万元。以上两项共计收入一百七十万元，解决了四百个民兵、难民等开支外，并开设了战时小医院、印发战地小报、传单，结合宣传攻势展开了杀敌竞赛。三、解决撤出群众生活，采取了“组织生产自救，从实际出发具体照顾”的方针，做到开支少，而又圆满解决了问题。如在照顾难民生活上，经过审查与民主讨论决定缺一件补一件，缺一表补一表，缺花补花，缺布补布。全县共补布三千六百八十一尺，花六百一十七斤，人六百口，每人尚不足五尺布。发救济粮，一千三百九十四个难民，每人每天米不足七两。三分之二的花布、粮食，均靠难民生产解决。将军墓撤出难民四十四人，每人即赚米四十二斤，解决了生活困难，做到自给自足。
