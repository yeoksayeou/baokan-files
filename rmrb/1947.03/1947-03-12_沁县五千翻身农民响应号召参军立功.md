　　Defend Chairman Mao, Defend Emancipation
　　Five Thousand Emancipated Farmers in Qin County Respond to the Call to Join the Army and Perform Meritorious Service
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 10th] "Defend Chairman Mao, join the army and perform meritorious service!" Under this solemn slogan, the emancipated farmers of Qin County accomplished this heroic feat in forty hours: five thousand emancipated farmers, merchants, students, and civil servants petitioned to kill the enemy, and have formed a "Chairman Mao Protection Vanguard." When Xiao Wenyu, secretary of the Qin County Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported that Chiang Kai-shek had once again invaded Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, thousands of emancipated farmers rose up and shouted: "Go to the front line, defend Chairman Mao, and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." The wave of joining the army quickly spread throughout the county. In Gu Yi village, forty-three people voluntarily signed up in six hours. Li Zhaoxiang, a 58-year-old emancipated hero from Chen village, also signed up. People said, "You are too old." He became anxious, lifted his cotton-padded jacket, and said loudly, "I am old, but can't I still carry water?" Another old man, Zhang Ertie, also insisted on going. After arguing, he finally agreed to take care of a dozen military families in the rear. Many labor heroes and model cadres have also requested to join the army. Retired soldiers Huo Niansuo and Huang Enrong returned to the battlefield. Zhao Shiliang from Pintou Village said: "The landlords in the village have been overthrown, but the feudal trees and the feudal roots have not been uprooted. We go to the front line to dig up these big roots." Wang Sihai, chairman of the Dongkun Farmers' Association, said: "Who doesn't want to sleep on a warm kang? If you don't revolt against Chiang Kai-shek, he will take your life." Wei Delong from Shangwan said: "Chairman Mao led us to emancipation, he is our benefactor. Chiang Kai-shek wants our lives, he is our enemy, let's go to the front line!"
　　Emancipation is the Guiding Light, Joining the Army is Taking the Lead
　　Heshun Cadres Take the Lead in Joining the Army
　　[This newspaper, Taihang, 10th] The 80,000 emancipated farmers of Heshun have greatly improved their awareness after general training in January and February. At the end of last month, during current affairs studies in various village schools, emancipated farmers spontaneously launched a wave of joining the army. Sun Guanghe, an emancipated old farmer from Qianqi Village, District Three, said: "In the past, I was afraid of my son and brothers joining the army. Since I received training in the district, I know that we cannot survive if Old Chiang attacks. If we don't fight Old Chiang, who will?" Liu Peide, the instructor of the W委会 [Military Affairs Committee] in Beiliyang, District Two, heard the call to join the army and said: "My brother went last time, and I will go this time. I won't come back until Old Chiang is defeated!" Under Liu Peide's influence, more than ten young people in the village have signed up. Xue Baoli, deputy village head of Xidong＠, District One, said: "Our cadres are the guiding lights in emancipation, and we must take the lead when joining the army." Under his leadership, dozens of young people in the village have signed up. In Yu Nv Village, District Three, and Xing Village, District One, under the leadership of cadres Gong Shunyuan, Wang Naibao, and others, more than thirty young people have signed up. On the 1st and 2nd of this month alone, more than 370 young people from the Chengguan District and Districts Two, Three, and Four have signed up, and the wave of joining the army is spreading throughout the county.
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Twelve veteran soldiers of the Fengfeng Mining Area's Mining Guard, after studying current affairs, unanimously requested to go to the front line. Cui Lairong said: "We won another great victory in Shandong, it's almost time for a counter-offensive, I've been wanting to go to the front line for a long time and have a good fight!" Encouraged by the enthusiasm of these veteran soldiers, eleven young team members also volunteered to join the army. Wan Qude said: "My family has been emancipated, and we have been given land and houses. I want to go to the front line with you to perform meritorious service!" On the morning of the 5th, more than a thousand workers and masses from nearby the mining area came with cigarettes, towels, and other gifts to see them off. A comrade worker said: "You are going to the front line to fight, and we will step up production in the rear. We will ensure that your lives are not difficult." (Shao Yu)
