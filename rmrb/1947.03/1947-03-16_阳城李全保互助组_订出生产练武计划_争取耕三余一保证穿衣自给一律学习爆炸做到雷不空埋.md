(Our newspaper, Taiyue, 14th dispatch) The Li Quanbao mutual aid group in Jiangli Village, Third District of Yangcheng, a hero group combining labor and military affairs, in order to intensify training and improve military techniques and tactics in this year's production campaign, has specifically summarized the achievements and experiences of last year's production and training, and formulated a production and training plan for this year. In last year's production campaign, the mutual aid group led by Li Quanbao, consisting of 57 people, combined with the mass movement, seized every opportunity to conduct military training, and achieved great results. The main reasons for the achievements were that everyone clearly understood that land reform, production, and military training were all for the purpose of emancipation: "Speak out bitterness and struggle to dig out the roots of poverty; mutual aid production to establish the roots of wealth," and "Military training to protect the good times." Therefore, in military training and production, everyone demonstrated the spirit of being active and enthusiastic, competing with each other, helping each other, learning from each other, and the poor and rich helping each other; secondly, democracy was promoted. All major and minor matters of production and military training were decided after everyone's research and discussion, and then resolutely implemented; and various competitions were launched to commend models. Thirdly, the system of equal exchange was implemented, with a work point system that ensured no one suffered losses and other methods based on work value. This year's production and training plan: In agriculture, in addition to intensive cultivation to strive for "cultivate three, surplus one," 80 mu of cotton and 5 mu of hemp will be planted to ensure self-sufficiency. In terms of sideline occupations, one pig will be raised for every two households, 112 chickens will be raised for the entire group, 160 silkworm egg sheets will be raised, one hive of bees will be raised, and 60 spinning women will be organized to spin 1,800 jin of cotton (two liang per person per day, calculated over ten months). Military training plan: (1) Rotation-based self-defense militia will all learn explosives, from explosion technology to explosion tactics, striving to ensure no empty burial of mines during wartime; grenade throwing technology must break the 35-meter record and be accurate, learning various terrains and postures for grenade throwing. Shooting skills are required to be mastered by everyone, with an average of one sharpshooter for every 20 people, ensuring every bullet hits the target. Everyone is required to be proficient in using various terrains and features for flexible advance and retreat. (2) Women's militia are required to learn explosion technology, grenade throwing is required to exceed 30 meters, and shooting is required to be mastered by everyone. (3) Self-defense teams are required to learn explosion, camouflage of mines, moisture-proof paving, etc. Grenade throwing is required to exceed 30 meters, and they must be able to utilize various terrains and features. (4) Each militia self-defense team will formulate its own plan and standards based on its own situation, and complete them in stages.

    订出生产练武计划
    争取耕三余一保证穿衣自给一律学习爆炸做到雷不空埋
    【本报太岳十四日电】阳城三区匠礼村劳武结合英雄李全保互助组，为了在今年生产运动中加紧训练，提高军事技术与战术，特总结了去年生产练武的成绩和经验，订出了今年生产练武的计划。在去年的生产运动中，李全保所领导的五十七人的互助组，结合群运，抓紧一切空隙进行练武，获得很大成绩。获得成绩的主要原因是由于大家明确了土地改革、生产、练武这三件事情都是为了翻身，“诉苦斗争，挖穷根；互助生产，扎富根”，“练武保卫好时光”。因此在练武与生产上，都发挥了每个人自动积极、互相竞赛、互相帮助、互相学习、贫富互济的精神；其次是发扬了民主。凡生产练武的大小事情，都经过大家研究决定，然后坚决执行；并发动了各种竞赛，表扬模范。再次是实行了等价交换，互不吃亏的工票制和按工作价等办法。今年的生产练武计划：农业方面，除精耕细作争取耕三余一外，要种棉八十亩，种麻五亩，保证自给。副业方面，每两家养猪一口，全组养鸡一百一十二只，养蚕一百六十席，养蜂一窝，组织纺妇六十人，纺花一千八百斤（每人每天二两，以十个月计算）。练武计划：（一）轮战自卫民兵一律学爆炸，由爆炸技术提高到爆炸战术，争取战时雷不空埋；投弹技术要打破三十五米纪录，而且不偏差，学会各种地形，各种姿势的投弹法。射击技术，要求人人精通，平均每廿人中产生一个神枪手，做到弹不虚发。要求每人都能熟练的利用各种地形地物，进退自如。（二）妇女民兵要求每人都学会爆炸技术，投弹要求超过三十米，射击上要求人人会打枪。（三）自卫队要求每人都学会爆炸和按埋伪装、防潮铺街等。投弹要求超过三十米，而且会利用各种地形地物。（四）每个民兵自卫队根据自己的情形，自订计划自订标准，分期完成。
