Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. Moscow News: The main topic of the second week of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting is the discussion of the Allied Control Council's report on the economic principles and reparations issues concerning the handling of Germany. It is generally believed that these two issues are the most important in the report, and also the largest differences among the four-power representatives in the Control Council's report. It is reported that when the Foreign Ministers discuss the economic principles, they will discuss them separately according to the following eleven parts: (1) Industrial level issue. (2) Elimination of war potential issue. (3) Food and rationing issue. (4) Agricultural issue. (5) Dissolution of cartels issue. (6) Import and export trade issue. (7) Domestic trade issue. (8) Economic unification issue. (9) Transportation issue. (10) Financial, banking, and economic policy issue. (11) Economic transfer issues between Germany and the Allied countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Moscow News: On the first day of the second week of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting—March 17th—Bidault served as chairman, and the meeting discussed the report of the German Control Council on economic principles and reparations issues. Bidault first asked the Foreign Ministers to make general statements on the above issues. Then, each aspect of these issues was discussed separately. British Foreign Secretary Bevin was the first to speak, followed by Molotov, who expressed the Soviet government's views on the issues under discussion, and then US Secretary of State Marshall spoke.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. Moscow News: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a lengthy statement at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting on the 17th. Molotov first reviewed the implementation of the Yalta and Potsdam Conference resolutions on the economic principles and reparations issues concerning the handling of Germany, criticizing the United States and Britain for failing to implement these resolutions, and especially mentioning Britain's unilateral actions, saying that Britain seized all of Germany's coal production in 1945 and all of the Ruhr area's steel production in 1946. Molotov said that such actions could not be tolerated. Molotov put forward the following suggestions at the meeting: (1) Immediately establish a central administrative body managed by Germans to handle industrial, transportation, commercial and other aspects. (2) Germany's coal production should be increased to 10 million or 12 million tons. (3) The Ruhr area should be jointly managed by the four countries. (4) Improve Germany's financial, economic and monetary system, and increase Germany's exports. (5) Nationalize the industries of trusts and cartels. (6) Seek the assistance of Germany's major political parties to complete the above work. (7) Eliminate the economic merger agreement in the British and American zones, because this agreement violates the Potsdam Agreement. (8) Determine the total amount of German reparations based on the 1938 world price standard; the 10 billion US dollars in reparations that the Soviet Union should receive should be obtained from the industrial equipment it removes in Germany, Germany's current production, and Germany's property abroad; German reparations should be paid off within ten years (starting from the date of the Potsdam Conference). (9) Restore the work of the Four-Power Reparations Committee. (10) Eliminate obstacles to the development of peacetime industry.
