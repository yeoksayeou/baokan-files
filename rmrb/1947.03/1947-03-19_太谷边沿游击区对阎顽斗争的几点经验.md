Some Experiences of the Taigu Border Guerrilla Area in the Struggle Against Yan's Stubborn Forces
    Bai Ruixi, Taigu County Magistrate

    Last summer and autumn, Yan's stubborn forces launched an offensive against us with a "flood-style" military strategy and a "sky full of stars" espionage policy, which put us in a passive and unfavorable position in the struggle against the enemy. Many newly liberated villages in the plains and eastern foothills were temporarily turned into guerrilla areas and enemy strongholds. This was the most serious period for Taigu since the Great Advance.

    In the recent four or five months, especially since the beginning of 1947, our struggle situation has gradually changed from passive to active, and the situation has improved day by day. This is partly due to constantly learning from the experiences of other regions in the struggle; on the other hand, it is also due to our exploration of some experiences in actual combat, which has improved our combat methods and increased our confidence in victory.

  (1) Improve Tactics and Widely Launch Guerrilla Warfare

    After a period of replenishment and training last autumn, the quality of the Independent Battalion has greatly improved. Under the slogans of "Killing the enemy to protect the home" and "There will be no peace until Yan Xishan's Jin-Sui Army is defeated," a killing enemy competition was launched. According to statistics from eight battles in the recent three months alone (early November to early February): a total of 121 enemies were killed or wounded, 92 were captured alive, 10 light machine guns, 3 small cannons, 1 grenade launcher, 61 rifles and carbines, 29 bayonets, 5,735 rounds of ammunition and other military supplies were seized. In addition, six attacks were carried out, and 2,500 catties of electric wire were collected, while our side paid the price of only one lightly wounded soldier. A record of 213 to 1 was created under the policy of eliminating enemy's active forces. In addition to the continuous improvement of the quality of the troops and the high fighting will, the continuous improvement of guerrilla tactics is also one of the main reasons for victory.

    1. The troops move quickly and do not form a pattern, making it difficult for the enemy to figure out, so that a small number of troops can be used to defend a larger area. The number of local armed forces of the enemy in Taigu is larger than ours. It has established 14 strongholds in our four districts, 4, 5, 6, and 7. This border line stretches for more than 80 miles from northeast to southwest. When our troops arrive in this area, the enemy will move and loot in those three districts, causing great harm to the masses. Later, we adopted the method of moving unpredictably and mostly at night. Although the troops were relatively tired, we achieved our task of eliminating the enemy's active forces. For example, recently, after our Independent Battalion moved from the 7th district to the 4th district, the enemy in the 4th district hid in the stronghold and dared not go out. Then, on February 1, we transferred to the 6th district. After the enemy in Bei[unclear] village in the 4th district discovered it, on February 4, the enemy company commander said to the soldiers: The Independent Battalion has arrived in the 6th district, we can boldly move around, and immediately after breakfast, went to Baicheng Town, five miles southwest of our Bei[unclear] village. Unexpectedly, our army had returned to the 4th district the night before, and immediately detoured to intercept the enemy, killing and wounding 22 enemies, capturing 21 alive, and seizing 2 light machine guns and 12 rifles. Then, on the evening of the 5th, our army transferred to the 6th district overnight and ambushed in Sigua Village. The enemy in Yangyi stronghold thought that our army was still in the 4th district, and a company boldly conducted field exercises in the direction of Sigua early on the 6th. When the enemy approached the entrance of the village, the grenades and bayonets of our ambushing soldiers appeared in front of the enemy. In just five minutes, the company was wiped out. This irregular flying tactic made the enemy always feel uneasy and dare not recklessly harass in all directions.

    2. Fight ambushes instead of attrition battles. In addition to a few cadres who are old soldiers of Yan's stubborn army, the enemy's local armed forces are mostly newly captured recruits and standing soldiers from its "governed villages." These people resent Yan's stubborn forces for conscripting soldiers and lack military common sense, especially afraid of our army's grenade charge, and collapse as soon as they are attacked. In the Baicheng battle, we killed, wounded and captured only 33 enemies, but the enemy lost more than 7,000 people, because more than half of the people took the opportunity to flee the battlefield. Understanding these weaknesses of the enemy, fighting ambushes, the victory is great and the losses are small.

    3. The combination of battalion soldiers and militia is good, which not only increases the strength, but also exercises the fighting courage of the militia. In the Dongjia battle and the Baicheng battle, the militia and the battalion soldiers fought side by side and seized enemy weapons together. However, in the cooperation, the militia should not be allowed to bear the main aspect or stand alone. At the same time, the victory products seized by the battalion soldiers should be appropriately distributed to the militia, which will further improve the morale of the militia, and they will also be willing to take the initiative to cooperate with the battalion soldiers.

    4. The use of battalion soldiers should be concentrated, and the organizational form of the militia should be flexible. In order to achieve a more effective elimination of the enemy's active forces, the use of battalion soldiers should not be too dispersed, because the powerful cooperation of district cadres and militia everywhere can widely launch guerrilla warfare. Therefore, the Independent Battalion generally chooses a mobile position, which can wait for an opportunity to attack the enemy and take care of the overall situation. However, the organization of the militia should not always imitate the battalion soldiers. The militia in the enemy stronghold villages can generally form a working team, and concentrate on activities, guerrilla warfare on the one hand, and work on the other. Below the team, villages are divided into several groups as units. The masses are familiar with the terrain when carrying out guerrilla activities, which makes it easy to penetrate behind enemy lines, and it is easier to contact the masses when carrying out work. The militia in non-stronghold villages should generally be scattered in villages as units, which is not easy to be separated from the masses, and take joint defense operations when necessary.

    5. In the militia's combat, it is necessary to overcome the "resisting bull's horn" mentality, and carry forward the tactics of detouring to the enemy's flanks and carrying out explosions and joint defense operations. Since the Great Advance, the "machine gun" mentality has grown in the militia, willing to fight hard battles, unwilling to guerrilla, and even less believe in the role of landmines. This mentality is the cause of Taigu's long-term inability to launch mass guerrilla warfare. After ideological rectification, the Fourth District has gradually overcome and corrected it in practical actions. Now it can not only extend to activities near the enemy's strongholds, but also protect the interests of the masses and take back the things that the enemy looted from the masses. Under the impetus and leadership of Jia Maohou, a first-class militia hero in the Taihang District, the militia in the Fifth District blocked the enemy in Rencun and protected Fancun and nearby villages. Their experience is to actively cooperate with the battalion soldiers when the battalion soldiers are present, and go deep behind enemy lines. When the battalion soldiers transfer, they take joint defense operations.

    (2) Strengthen Unified Leadership and Seriously Rectify the Camp

    In this regard, our neighboring counties have also gained some experience, and have earnestly implemented the regulations of concurrent posts, concurrent battles, and concurrent work. One of the county Independent Battalion, county magistrate (battalion commander) and county party secretary (political commissar) often accompanies the troops. Not only do they jointly study various strategies and tactics for fighting against the enemy with the deputy battalion commander and deputy political commissar, and even directly participate in the war; but they also go deep into the soldiers to understand the soldiers' ideological status and personal life and family situation, which is convenient for solving problems in a timely manner, consolidating the troops, and adjusting the relationship between the local area and the troops.

    Secondly, the deputy battalion commander and deputy political commissar of the Independent Battalion participate in the county party committee to jointly study the work of the whole county and deploy work, so that local work and combat tasks are closely integrated; at the same time, when the troops arrive in each district, they can check and help the work of the district in the name of the county party committee. Because the focus of struggle (content and region) in each period is determined uniformly, it is convenient to fully carry out the work.

    Similarly, one of the district chief (captain) and branch committee secretary (political commissar) often lives and acts with the district cadre team. Moreover, each district forms the wandering militia into a working team, with the district chief and the director of the district armed committee concurrently serving as the captain and deputy captain, and the branch committee secretary concurrently serving as the political commissar. This makes the district cadre team and the militia more closely integrated. The grass-roots organization of the working team is a group, with the village as the unit, and the village chief and the director of the armed committee serving as the group leader and deputy group leader respectively, leading the armed activities on the one hand, and carrying out the work of the village on the other.

    Regarding the work of rectifying the camp, a large number of cleansing work has been done in the troops and the militia, resolutely cleaning out the reactionary class enemies (the new soldiers are strictly reviewed when they join the army), and grasping the weapons in the hands of reliable elements. This work should be carried out universally, especially in the militia.

　　太谷边沿游击区  对阎顽斗争的几点经验
    太谷县长  白瑞西
    去年夏秋两季，阎顽在军事上以“水漫式”，特务工作上以“满天星”的政策向我展开攻势后，曾使我们在对敌斗争上处于被动与不利的形势。将平川及东山麓的许多新解放村庄，又暂时变成游击区和敌据点，这是大进军以来，太谷局面最严重的时期。
    最近四五个月，特别是进入一九四七年以来，我们的斗争形势逐渐由被动走向主动，局面也随着日益好转。这是一方面由于在斗争中不断吸取其它地区的经验；另一方面也由于我们在实际斗争中摸索到一些经验，提高了我们的斗争方法，增加了我们斗争胜利的信心。
  （一）提高战术广泛开展游击战
    去年秋季以后，独立营经过一度补充训练，质量大大提高，在“杀敌保家”和“不打垮阎锡山晋绥军不能过安心日子”的口号下，开展了杀敌竞赛。单以最近三个月（十一月初至二月初）的八次战斗统计：共毙伤敌人一二一名、生俘九二名、缴获轻机枪十挺、小炮三门、掷弹筒一个、步马枪六一枝、刺刀二九把、子弹五七三五发及其它军用品一部。此外并破击六次，收电线二五○○斤，而我方所付之代价仅轻伤战士一名。在消灭敌人有生力量的方针下创造了二一三比一的纪录。能获得这样光辉的成绩，除部队质量的不断提高与斗争意志的昂扬外，游击战术的不断改进也是胜利主要原因之一。
    １、部队运动迅速，且不形成规律，使敌人捉摸不定，这样可用少数部队保卫较大的地区。太谷敌人地方武装的数量比我们大，它在我四、五、六、七四个区内打下了十四个据点。这条边沿线由东北到西南长达八十余里，我方部队到这个区，敌即在那三个区活动抢掠，给群众危害很大。以后我们采取了出没无常，且多在夜间运动的办法，虽然部队比较疲劳，却达到了我们消灭敌人有生力量的任务。比如最近我独立营由七区到四区后，四区敌人即钻在据点不敢外出，我即于二月一日转到六区，四区北＠村敌人发觉后，于二月四日敌连长向战士说：独立营已到六区，我们可以大胆活动，即于早饭后到我北＠村西南五里之白城镇，不料我军已于前一日晚又转回四区，当即迂回截击敌人，毙伤敌人二二名，生俘二一名，缴获轻机枪二挺、步枪一二枝。接着我军于五日晚又连夜转往六区，设伏于四卦村，阳邑据点之敌以为我军尚在四区，一个中队于六日早大胆向四卦方向作野外演习，当敌人接近村口，我伏兵之手榴弹刺刀即出现敌人面前，仅历五分钟，即将该中队消灭。这种不规律的飞行战术，使敌时刻提心吊胆，不敢肆无忌惮的四出骚扰。
    ２、打伏击仗不打消耗仗。敌人的地方武装，除了少数干部是阎顽军的老战士外，其余都是新抓壮丁和它“治村”区的常备兵。这些人，既怨恨阎顽抓丁，又缺乏军事常识，尤其害怕我军之手榴弹冲锋，一打即垮。在白城战斗中，我毙伤俘敌仅三三名，但敌人方面则损失了七千余人，因一半以上的人数都在战场上乘机逃散。了解敌人这些弱点，打伏击，胜利既大，损失又小。
    ３、营兵民兵结合得好，不但力量大，而且锻炼了民兵的战斗勇气。东贾战斗和白城战斗，民兵和营兵并肩作战，同样缴获了敌人武器。但在配合作战中，不能让民兵担负主要方面或独挡一面。同时营兵缴获之胜利品，要适当分给民兵一部，这样更会提高民兵的斗志，而且也愿主动配合营兵作战。
    ４、营兵的使用应集中，民兵的组织形式要灵活。为了要达到更有效消灭敌人有生力量，营兵的使用就不能过于分散，因为到处有区干队和民兵的有力配合，一样可广泛的开展游击战。因此，独立营一般是选择机动位置，既可待机打击敌人，又能照顾了全面，但民兵的组织则不宜老模仿营兵。在敌人据点村庄的民兵，一般可组成武工队，集中活动，一面游击，一面开展工作。队以下，以村为单位分成若干小组，这样在进行游击活动时，群众地形熟悉，易于深入敌后，同样在进行工作时可以更容易的联系群众。在非据点村的民兵一般应以村为单位分散活动，不易脱离群众，必要时采取联防作战。
    ５、民兵的作战，必须克服“抵牛角”的思想，要发扬迂回敌人侧背，开展爆炸和联防作战的战术。自从大进军以来，民兵中滋长着“机关枪”思想，愿打硬仗，不愿游击，更不相信地雷的作用。太谷长期的不能开展起群众性的游击战，就是这种思想在作怪。四区经过思想整顿，已在实际行动中逐渐克服改正。现在不但能伸到敌人据点附近活动，而且保护了群众利益，把敌人抢掠群众的东西夺回来。五区民兵在太行区一等民兵杀敌英雄贾毛猴的推动、带头下，阻击了任村敌人保卫了范村及附近村庄。他们的经验是营兵在时积极配合营兵作战，深入敌后，营兵转移即采取联防作战。
    （二）加强统一领导认真整顿阵营
    在这一点上我们相邻县同样取得了一些经验，切实作到了兼职兼战兼工作的规定。在县独立营、县长（营长）和县委书记（政委）经常有一人随同部队行动。不但和副营长、副政委共同研究对敌斗争的各种策略战术，以至直接参战；而且深入到战士中去了解战士的思想状况和个人的生活与家庭情况，既便于及时解决问题，巩固部队，又可以调整地方与部队的关系。
    其次是独立营副营长、副政委参加县委会，统一研究全县工作，布置工作，使地方工作和战斗任务密切结合；同时部队到各区时，他们可以县委名义检查帮助区的工作。因统一决定每一时期斗争的重点（内容与地区上），便于全力开展工作。
    同样区长（队长）和分委书记（政委）中经常有一人和区干队共同生活，共同行动。而且各区把流亡的民兵组成武工队，由区长、区武委会主任分兼正副队长，分委书记兼政委。这样使区干队和民兵更加紧密的结合起来。武工队的基层组织是小组，以村为单位，村长和武委会主任分任正副组长，一面领导了武装活动，一面也能进行村的工作。
    关于整顿阵营工作，部队和民兵中都作了大量清洗工作，把反动的阶级敌人坚决清洗出去（部队当新战士入伍即作严格审查），把武器掌握在可靠分子手中。这一工作特别在民兵中应普遍进行。
