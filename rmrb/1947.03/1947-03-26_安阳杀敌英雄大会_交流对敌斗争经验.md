    Anyang Heroic Gathering to Kill the Enemy
    Exchanging Experiences in Combating the Enemy
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 23rd] The first Anyang conference of heroes who killed the enemy and model workers after the launch of the merit campaign in Anyang was held on March 6th on the border of Anyang and Lin counties amidst the busy struggle against the enemy. Heroes and model workers who supported the front lines through production and self-sufficiency, snipers, demolition experts, creators of guerrilla bases behind enemy lines, and female guerrillas appearing for the first time in the Taihang Mountains all gathered to exchange experiences to strengthen the overall struggle against the enemy on both the front and behind enemy lines. The conference was filled with new victories in the patriotic self-defense war. A large banner at the front of the venue read: "Experience needs to be improved; never be complacent or arrogant; the enemy has not been completely defeated; we must make persistent efforts!" On the first day of the conference, nearby residents and businesses spontaneously came in groups to congratulate and express their gratitude. Political Commissar Chen called on all heroes and model workers at the conference to further deepen the merit campaign, vigorously develop mass guerrilla warfare, carry out mass work behind enemy lines, and build and consolidate guerrilla bases behind enemy lines. At the merit evaluation meeting on the 9th, democracy was highly promoted, and mass assessment and review were brought into play. Leaders also personally consulted the heroes for their opinions on the command of the struggle against the enemy, which further united the upper and lower levels and the heroes. Duan Fazhang's and Ren Wenliang's work teams, which created guerrilla bases behind enemy lines, flying capture expert Hu Degui, demolition expert Song Sheng, mine-laying expert Yang Kuanxing, female guerrilla Han Erhua, and other heroes have been selected and awarded prizes and commendations. Each hero immediately formulated new plans for struggle based on the summary opinions of the conference, preparing to embark on new battles and push the county's merit campaign to a new climax.
