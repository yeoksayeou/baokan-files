(This report from Taiyue, 27th) The Taiyue Administrative Office recently formulated a large-scale production campaign plan for this year. It calls on the masses throughout the region to combine land reform and launch a large-scale production movement. The original text roughly stated: This year, the region's production will focus on agriculture, combined with sideline occupations, organized to overcome difficulties, and strive to achieve "cultivate three, surplus one." In agriculture: universally develop mutual aid and exchange labor to overcome difficulties. In the old areas, mutual aid and exchange labor should reach over 70%, and in the new areas, strive to gradually reach over 60%. The biggest difficulty in this year's production is the widespread and serious lack of livestock, which must be resolved through various methods such as loans, labor exchange and mutual assistance, and promoting joint purchases. Attention must also be paid to improving agricultural technology, promoting improved varieties, and striving for an increase of eight sheng of coarse grains per mu throughout the region, and vigorously promoting cotton planting and other special crops. Sideline occupations should focus on textiles and transportation. Ensure that over 50% of women are organized to engage in textiles. The silkworm production in Jin, Yang, Gao, Shimin, and Qingshui should increase by one-third. In basic areas, strive for an average of one pig per two households and two chickens per person. In terms of handicrafts: industries such as papermaking, towel making, and coal and iron industries should strive to achieve self-sufficiency on the existing basis. Production in border areas mainly adopts the method of combining labor and military affairs, and when necessary, the method of joint defense and large-scale labor exchange can be adopted.

(This report from Taihang, 27th) The Taihang Administrative Office recently announced the overall production plan for agriculture, sideline occupations, and industry in 1947. The plan takes agriculture as the main focus, develops a comprehensive production combining sideline agriculture, and vigorously develops handicrafts, industry, and commerce as the general guidelines; strives to universally achieve "cultivate three, surplus one" in the entire region except for the tense war zones, and ensures sufficient food and clothing in the border areas, striving for a surplus as the goal. The basic methods are to organize more extensively and comprehensively, improve labor efficiency, and improve technology through accurate calculation and rational use of labor and livestock power. The plan is divided into four parts: 1. In agriculture and sideline occupations, this year, it is required to organize 80% of the labor force in the entire region, and 70% of the semi-labor force and auxiliary labor force. In the new areas, strive to organize over 70% of the full labor force and over 50% of the semi- and auxiliary labor force. Plant one million mu of cotton and ten thousand mu of indigo in the entire region. Continue to promote "811 millet" of 30,000 mu, "Golden Queen Corn" and "169 Wheat", and carry out mass seed selection, breeding, and seed exchange campaigns. Plant five million trees in the entire region this year, striving for a survival rate of 70%. 2. Develop sideline occupations in a planned and large-scale manner. Carry out production such as silkworm breeding, beekeeping, medicinal herb collection, hunting, weaving, salt boiling, saltpeter boiling, and brick and tile lime burning according to local characteristics. Raise chickens universally throughout the region and ensure that every village raises pigs. This year, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry will increase the breeding of improved varieties such as "Leghorn chickens" and "Berkshire pigs" in preparation for promotion next year. The primary task of handicrafts and industry is to develop textiles, increasing the number of hand-drawn looms from 13,000 to over 20,000, developing spinning machines and large spinning wheels, increasing the number of textile women to 70% of the female population, and organizing 60% of them. Secondly, attention should also be paid to developing wool spinning, coal and iron industries, and papermaking industry, striving to produce 50,000 pieces of paper, achieving four-fifths of self-sufficiency. 3. Further develop cooperation and transportation. Develop cooperatives in every administrative village in both new and old areas, and organize them in a concealed form in guerrilla areas. 4. Leadership issues: The plan points out that it is necessary to universally educate the masses on uprooting poverty and establishing wealth, further develop labor hero movements, and help the masses formulate plans to get rich and various production plans. Attention must also be paid to vigorously leading production in border areas, organizing the combination of labor and military affairs, and timely solving the production difficulties of the masses in border areas. A spokesman for the Administrative Office believes that the people of Taihang District have the experience of large-scale production campaigns in 1944, 1945, and 1946, and have a foundation where the labor force in the old areas has been organized to over 70%. Many villages achieved "cultivate three, surplus one" last year. Now the people of the entire region have realized "the tiller has his own land," and production conditions and enthusiasm have been unprecedentedly improved. We have the confidence and strength to complete this large-scale production plan that exceeds any previous year, and guarantee that the entire region achieves "cultivate three, surplus one." Lay a material foundation for self-defense and counter-attack to welcome victory.
