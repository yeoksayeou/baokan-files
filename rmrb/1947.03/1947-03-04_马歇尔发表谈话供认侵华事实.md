Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. According to the United States Information Service, Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, on the 26th, made a statement on the China issue, saying: "Regarding the transfer of surplus materials, the 1946 ship donation to China, and the implementation of the aid to China act, the U.S. government is now trying to eliminate its technical difficulties. The act stipulates U.S. military training, service programs, and technical consultation for China, etc., at that time to relieve the duties of the U.S. military in China and to promote the Chinese government to further guarantee and improve the safety of navigation in its territorial waters." Note: The United States' strengthening of aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, explained by Marshall as "aiming to relieve the duties of the U.S. military in China," just reveals the true colors of the U.S. imperialist aims in China. His so-called promotion of the Chiang Kai-shek government to "further guarantee or improve the safety of navigation in its territorial waters" is also an admission of the fact of U.S. imperialism's aggression against China's territorial waters.

　　马歇尔发表谈话供认侵华事实
    【新华社延安一日电】据美国新闻处华盛顿讯：美国务卿马歇尔二十六日就中国问题发表谈话称：“关于剩余物资之转移、一九四六年船只赠华与援华法案之执行，美国政府现正设法消除其技术上之困难。该项法案规定美国对华军事训练、服务计划及技术咨询等等，其时的在解除美军在华之职务，并促使中国政府更进一步保障及改进其领海内航行之安全。”按：美国加强援蒋内战，被马歇尔解释为“目的在解除美军在华之职务”恰好露出了美国在华帝国主义目的之马脚。其所谓促进蒋介石政府“进一步保障或改进其领海内航行之安全”，则又供认了美国帝国主义侵略中国领海的事实。
