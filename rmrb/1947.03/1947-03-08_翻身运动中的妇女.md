Women in the Upsurge Movement

　　Over the past year, women in various regions have been actively involved in the struggles of speaking out about grievances, conducting land redistribution and settling accounts with landlords. In speaking out, they have demonstrated that women not only share the same miserable, exploited lives as peasants but also sometimes experience even deeper suffering than men. Therefore, their primary demands align with those of the peasants, which is to eliminate the feudal economic exploitation of the landlord class. Consequently, only by thoroughly eliminating the landlord class can women achieve liberation. During this upsurge movement, a vast number of impoverished women peasants in Xiajin, Enxian, Julu, Pingxiang, Jixian, Ningnan and other places, through speaking out, realized that the root cause of their hardship, coarse food, abuse, and mistreatment stemmed from the usurious high rents and exploitation by landlords. Their class consciousness was significantly heightened, and they immediately established their own organizations to fight alongside the peasants against the landlords and reclaim the land that had been seized. In border areas such as Fushan and Jiyuan, while the men were fighting, the women were settling accounts and distributing land in the villages, demonstrating their urgent desire to be liberated from the land. However, some places, believing that women were backward or thinking they could be mobilized later during the production movement, allowed them to drift along without including them in meetings, speaking-out sessions, training of activists, or cultivation of cadres. Even when they were included, it was only on an individual basis, leaving the majority outside the movement's circle, which added many difficulties to the movement. For example, in Diantou, Wu'an, peasant women were not vigilant against landlord women and engaged in casual chatting while carrying water and doing chores together, leaking secrets of the peasant association, leading to peasants letting information slip to the landlord's detriment. In Changzhi, Lu'an, Xiangyuan, Licheng and other counties, it was commonly found that women were hiding stolen goods for landlords, acting as "air-raid shelters" for them, and undermining the efforts of cadres and activists. This proves that if women are not mobilized or are not mobilized thoroughly, the backward elements cannot be eliminated; consequently, the landlord class cannot be completely overthrown, and the peasants cannot achieve a thorough upsurge.

　　Deep within the movement, many places that had previously not paid enough attention to mobilizing women have begun to do so. Yaoshan proposed: "If women are not mobilized or not thoroughly mobilized, the land reform review can only be considered half complete." Wu'an proposed a "whole family, one heart" movement in the class investigation, mobilizing women to pursue landlords. Changzhi, Lu'an, Xiangyuan, Licheng and other counties also proposed: "Mobilize women to eliminate the landlord's 'air-raid shelters'." After class education, the awareness of the broad masses of women was raised, and they resolutely broke ties and separated from the landlords, automatically digging out "air-raid shelters". After the women of Su Dian, Changzhi, realized the landlord's plot, they took out more than a hundred packages that had been hidden for the landlord in two days, cutting off the landlord's feudal tail. This proves that only by thoroughly mobilizing women can the landlord class be completely eliminated. However, due to past neglect of women, it is easy for people to develop a "that's good enough" attitude when they first rise up, which is worth noting. I believe that the primary task of the women's movement at present is to mobilize and thoroughly mobilize the poor women, unite the middle peasant women, and repeatedly investigate together with the peasants, and finally eliminate the landlords who have been omitted and hidden, in order to achieve the thorough liberation of the peasant class (including women). Therefore, in areas where women have already been initially mobilized, complacency should be avoided and mobilization should continue in depth. In old liberated areas that have entered production, thorough inspections should continue during production. As for areas where women's mobilization has not yet formed a large-scale movement, they must speed up and catch up.

　　After the land reform, with the peasants freed from the landlord class's exploitation and their living conditions improved, many families have become more harmonious. At the same time, with the demonstration of women's strength in the struggle, traditional ideas that belittle women have begun to change. However, the feudal shackles on women for thousands of years are difficult to completely remove in the upsurge movement. Therefore, after the thorough completion of land reform, it should continue to be resolved as an internal problem of the peasants in an educational way, but it should still be regarded as sweeping away the feudal ruling ideology of the landlord class, and therefore should still be resolved by raising the class consciousness of the peasant class, rather than simply focusing on technology. Some places are resolving issues such as what the daughters-in-law wear and their participation in social activities by holding three-way meetings of mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law, and young women, promoting harmony between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and between sisters-in-law, which is good. But it would be better if it could be carried out from both men and women and raised to a high level of class consciousness, so that they could realize that the disharmony in the past and the internal oppression and abuse were mainly caused by the exploitation of the landlord class, thereby concentrating their hatred on the landlords, resolutely clearing its influence, uniting closely, and developing production; and from production, continuing to raise women's awareness, improve family relations and economic status, in order to achieve women's complete liberation.

### 翻身运动中的妇女

　　翻身运动中的妇女
    一年来各地妇女纷纷卷入诉苦清算分田斗争，在诉苦中证明妇女不仅和农民过着同样被剥削的悲惨生活，而且痛苦的感受有时比农民还深。所以她们的主要要求和农民是一致的，同样是要解除地主阶级的封建经济剥削。因而只有彻底消灭地主阶级，妇女才能求得解放。此次翻身运动中，夏津、恩县、巨鹿、平乡、冀县、宁南等地广大赤贫农妇女，经过诉苦，认识到自己吃糠咽菜、挨打受气的老根，原来是在高利贷重租剥削的地主身上，阶级觉悟顿形提高，并立即建立自己组织与农民并肩对地主展开斗争，收回被夺田地。浮山、济源等边地，男人打仗，女人在村清算分田，表现出她们要从土地上解放的迫切要求。但是有的地方以为妇女落后，或认为在生产运动中再去发动，以致任其自流，开会、诉苦、积极分子训练、干部培养中都没有她们；或者只是个别的吸收她们，大多数仍站在运动圈外，给运动增加了许多困难。例如武安店头农妇对地主妇女不警惕，在一起抬水做活闲拉扯，将农会秘密泄露，形成农民斗争，农妇透气现象。长、潞、襄、黎等县普遍发现妇女替地主隐藏赃物，给地主当“防空洞”，并拉扯干部积极分子的后腿。由此证明，如果不发动妇女或发动得不彻底，则落后层即不能消灭；因之地主阶级亦不能彻底打垮，而农民亦即不能彻底翻身。
    深入运动中，许多过去对发动妇女注意不够的地方已开始注意了。尧山提出：“那里妇女没发动或发动不彻底，翻身检查只算完成一半。”武安在查阶级中提出全家一条心运动，发动妇女追击地主。长、潞、襄、黎等县亦提出：“发动妇女消灭地主‘防空洞’”。经过阶级教育广大妇女觉悟提高，坚决撕破情面和地主最后分家，自动挖掉“防空洞”。长治苏店妇女认识地主阴谋后，两天内即拿出给地主隐藏的百多个包袱，割掉地主封建尾巴。证明，只有彻的发动妇女才能彻底消灭地主阶级。但由于过去对妇女的轻视，故当她们刚起来后，一般人往往容易产生“差不多”的自满思想，这是值得注意的，我以为目前妇女运动的首要任务，即是发动并彻底发动赤贫穷妇女团结中农妇女，和农民一道反复清查，并最后消灭遗漏及隐蔽地主，以求得农民阶级（包括妇女）的彻底解放。因此妇女已有初步发动的地方，应力戒自满继续深入发动，已进入生产的老区亦应在生产中继续深入检查；至于直到现在妇女发动尚未形成大规模运动的地区，则尤须快马加鞭，迎头赶上。
    经过土地改革，农民解除地主阶级的剥削，生活改善后，许多家庭已趋于和睦；同时经过斗争中妇女力量的显示，轻视妇女的传统观念也已开始在改变着。但几千年来对妇女的封建束缚很难于翻身运动中完全解除，故土地改革彻的完成后，还应继续作为农民内部问题以教育方式解决，但仍应视为是扫除地主阶级的封建统治思想，因而仍应以提高农民阶级觉悟来解决，而不是单纯从技术上着眼。有些地方是以召开婆婆、媳妇、闺女等三种会议的方式，解决媳妇穿衣，参加社会活动等问题，促进婆媳、姑嫂和睦，这是好的。但如果能从男女双方进行，并提到高度阶级觉悟则更好，以便使他们认识过去家庭不和与内部的压迫虐待等主要是地主阶级的剥削所造成，从而把仇恨集中到地主身上，坚决清除其影响，一致亲密团结，生产发家；并从生产中，继续提高妇女觉悟，改善家庭关系及经济地位，才能求得妇女的完全解放。
