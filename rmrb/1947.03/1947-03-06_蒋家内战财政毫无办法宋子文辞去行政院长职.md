Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: According to a Nanjing dispatch from the Central News Agency: The Kuomintang Executive Yuan President, Soong Tzu-wen, has resigned and is temporarily replaced by Chiang Kai-shek. In a report answering questions at the Legislative Yuan's temporary meeting on the morning of the 1st, Soong Tzu-wen admitted that the Kuomintang's financial and economic crisis "has never been as serious as it is currently facing." The Kuomintang government is "falling into a war that consumes more than the War of Resistance Against Japan." He admitted that the "only way" for the Kuomintang government to balance revenue and expenditure has always been to "rely mainly on the printing press to make up for it." Soong Tzu-wen said that "I myself seem to be a public enemy, and whenever prices skyrocket, I am cursed," and "it can almost only be considered fate." According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 1st, a Shanghai newspaper commentary stated: Soong Tzu-wen's resignation will not solve China's economic chaos, pointing out that "as long as the civil war continues, more serious inflation cannot be stopped." It also pointed out that the successor is just another member of a "privileged family."

　　蒋家内战财政毫无办法宋子文辞去行政院长职
    【新华社延安三日电】据中央社南京一日消息：国民党行政院长宋子文已辞职，改由蒋介石暂行兼理。宋子文在一日晨在立法院临时会议答复质询之报告中承认，国民党财政经济危机，“从来没有像目前所遭遇的这样严重”。国民党政府正“坠入比较抗日消耗更为严重的战争中”。承认国民党政府平衡收支的“唯一办法”，一向是“主要靠印刷机来弥补”。宋子文说他“本人已经好像是公众的仇敌，每当物价暴涨，本人即被人唾骂，而“几乎只可认为命运所支配”。另据合众社上海一日电传沪报评论称：宋子文之辞职，并不能解决中国经济之紊乱，指出：“只要内战继续进行，更严重的通货膨胀便不可能制止。”并指出继任者只是另一“特权家族”分子。
