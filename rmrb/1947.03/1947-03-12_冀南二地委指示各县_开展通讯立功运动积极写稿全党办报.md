　　Second Prefectural Committee of Jinnan Directs All Counties
    Launch Communication Merit Campaign, Actively Write Articles, and Run Newspapers by the Whole Party
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Propaganda Department of the Second Sub-district Committee of Jinnan, in order to make the district's communication and reporting work more timely and regular, and to rapidly and balancedly develop communication work, recently instructed all counties, pointing out that the People's Daily and the Jinnan Daily are their own party newspapers, and are the guide for the actions of the party, government, army, and people of the whole district. Therefore, they cannot be simply regarded as matters for the comrades of the newspaper offices. According to the central government's spirit of "the whole party runs the newspapers," it is necessary to organize all party members to lead the masses to serve the party newspapers (writing articles and offering opinions on the newspapers). In particular, the propaganda departments should take the lead in completing this task. Regarding the specific methods of communication organization, it is stipulated that counties that do not have communication cadres should quickly assign them. The newspaper office has a business guidance relationship with the communication cadres, and the prefectural committee's propaganda department has an organizational leadership relationship with the communication cadres. All members of the county committees should organize a central communication group. In addition to personally writing articles, they should also lead and promote the communication groups of the party, government, army, and people's systems to carry out reporting work. The propaganda departments of each county should conduct an inspection and rectification of the existing communication work. The central group and the communication cadres should earnestly take responsibility for leadership. When each county arranges, inspects, and summarizes any work, it should also arrange, inspect, and summarize communication work. The propaganda cadres must report to the prefectural committee's propaganda department once a month. In order to launch a writing campaign and increase enthusiasm for communication writing, a communication merit campaign should be launched. Comrades who are enthusiastic and actively write articles should be especially commended.

　　冀南二地委指示各县
    开展通讯立功运动积极写稿全党办报
    【本报讯】冀南二分区地委宣传部，为使该区通讯报导工作，作到更加及时和经常，使通讯工作发展迅速走向平衡，日前特指示各县，指出人民日报、冀南日报都是自己的党报，是全区党政军民行动的指南，因此不能单纯看成报社同志的事情，必须根据中央“全党办报”的精神，组织全体党员带领群众，为党报服务（写稿与对报纸提意见），特别是宣传部门，更应带头完成此种任务。在通讯组织的具体办法上，规定：凡没有通讯干事的县份，应迅速配备起来，报社对通讯干事是业务指导关系，地委宣传部对通讯干事是组织领导关系。各县委会全体委员，应组织一个中心通讯小组，除亲自写稿外，并分别领导推动党政军民各系统通讯小组进行报导工作。各县宣传部对现有通讯工作，应作一检查与整理，中心小组与通讯干事应切实负责领导。各县布置检查总结任何工作时，同时就应布置检查总结通讯工作，宣干每月必须向地委宣传部报告一次。为了掀起写稿运动，提高通讯写作的热情，应展开通讯立功活动。对热心积极写稿的同志，应特别给以表扬。
