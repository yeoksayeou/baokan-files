　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Associated Press, London: The "Workers' Daily" published an article on the 4th entitled "Sunset of the British Empire" (according to a British saying, the British Empire is the empire on which the sun never sets). The article stated that the empire "is a rock around the neck of the British people, draining the fruits of their labor into useless military spending. It wastes manpower in the form of occupying forces and plunges vast lands of the world into poverty and industrial backwardness. The sun has already set on the British Empire, and even billions of dollars cannot sustain it! Britain will be happy to understand this, and if a militant society at home is combined with a progressive foreign policy, it will possess everything needed to victoriously solve problems in the future.”
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: TASS, New York: According to Cook, the London correspondent for the "Chicago Sun," the British government recently intended to import Greek tobacco instead of American tobacco in order to preserve its dollar reserves. However, the American government clearly stated that this behavior violated the conditions of the loan to Britain. Therefore, the British government abandoned any attempt to reduce the import of American tobacco to below 200 million US dollars in 1947.

　　没落的英国
    【新华社延安五日电】美联社伦敦讯：工人日报于四日刊载题为《日落大英帝国》，（按照英国的俗话是大英帝国日不落）的文章，该文称：帝国“是围绕在英国人民颈子上的一块磐石，它拿英国人民的劳动成果流入无用的军费里去，它以占领军的形式来浪费着人力，并将世界上大片土地投入贫穷与工业落后之中。太阳已照在大英帝国头上了，这个帝国纵有亿万美元也保持不住了！对这一点理解得愉快英国就会变得愉快，假使在国内提出一个战斗性的社会与进步的外交政策结合，将来它就拥有一切胜利解决问题所需要的东西”。
    【新华社延安十四日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：据芝加哥太阳报驻伦敦记者库赫称：英国政府最近为了保留美元外汇，曾拟输入希腊烟草以代替美国烟草，但美国政府明白表示这种行为违反对英贷款之条件，因此英政府便放弃了减少一九四七年美国烟草输入至二万万美元以下的任何企图。
