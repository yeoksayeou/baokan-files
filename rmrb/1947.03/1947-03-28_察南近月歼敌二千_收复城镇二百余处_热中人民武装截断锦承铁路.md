The enemy counterattacked with over 500 reinforcements the next day but was repulsed. On the night of the 10th, the people's armed forces raided Jia Chezhan between Jinlingsi and Chaoyang, capturing alive the commander of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the Northern Rehe Detachment, Xi Fengru, and 10 others, and killing or wounding over 20. On the same night, a unit of the people's armed forces raided Qinghemen between Yixian and Fuxin. The next day, Chiang's army from Jinzhou went to reinforce it, but was ambushed on the way, capturing over 30 and killing or wounding nearly 100. On the 10th, the people's armed forces in central Rehe carried out sabotage operations between Lingyuan and Yebaishou. The Jinzhou-Chengde Railway has been cut off. (2) The people's armed forces in southern Chahar have annihilated over 2,200 Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi troops in Daxinyang in Zhuolu, Nanjouchang in Huaian, and other places in recent months, and recovered over 200 towns. The vast area in the Xuanhua, Zhuolu, and Huaian areas, north to Zhangjiakou, south to Huashaoying, west to Chaigoubao, and east to Shenjing, is now under the control of the people's armed forces.
