Sights and Sounds from Frontline Service

　　Living in the liberated area, serving at the front lines.
　　The Kuomintang troops once stayed in the village, the damage everywhere truly heartbreaking:
　　Four or five li away from the village, everything is barren;
　　Waist-high tree stumps, branches used to build walls;
　　From the village entrance, pillboxes stand on both sides;
　　Crisscrossing trenches, doors covering the top;
　　Facing the street, the residential courtyards, the gates all blocked.
　　After a long time of turning around, finally found the alley to enter the house;
　　Every house is connected, making it very convenient to visit each other.
　　Turning and twisting, an old man stood by the alley,
　　Before I could ask, tears immediately streamed down his face:
　　"Comrade, look, the doors have all been taken away,
　　Some used to cover trenches, some went into the baking fields.
　　Cattle, sheep, chickens, and dogs, all filled the 'Central' [Kuomintang] stomachs.
　　Chests overturned, cabinets opened, saying they were looking for Communists,
　　Clothes and belongings, everything swept away.
　　If anyone tried to reason, they would be slapped hard.
　　Women were raped, too terrible to speak of.
　　Upon seeing young and strong men, they were forced to become soldiers,
　　Uttering not a word, they were called Communists,
　　Pointing a gun at you, they would take your life.
　　Having tasted the 'Central' flavor, recognizing the bandit Chiang Kai-shek,
　　The name 'Central' spells disaster, an extremely fitting name.
　　I am already seventy, unable to go to the battlefield;
　　This is my grandson, old enough to be a soldier.
　　He joined the Eighth Route Army, joined the Communist Party,
　　He will surely avenge us and eliminate the bandit Chiang Kai-shek!"
　　The old man's words reached this point, choking and unable to continue.
　　I also didn't say anything, just offered a few words of comfort.
　　Passing through many homes, excrement and urine everywhere, extremely filthy;
　　Inside the houses and in the courtyards, it was all the same.
　　Unconsciously shedding tears, I lost my appetite.
　　It has been two weeks now, and I still cannot forget.
　　Writing this to publish in the newspaper, to inform all the fellow villagers.

　　前线服务见闻
    家住解放区，服务到前方。
    顽军曾住村，到处实堪伤：
    离村四五里，均是秃光光；
    腰高树桩桩，枝头札做墙；
    走到村头起，碉堡矗两旁；
    纵横作战壕，门板盖顶上；
    临街住宅院，大门全堵挡。
    回转好大会，找到进宅巷；
    家家相通连，串门极便当。
    转弯又抹角，一翁立巷旁，
    没等我发问，立即泪两行：
    “同志你来看，屋门全摘光，
    有的盖战壕，有的入烤场。
    牛羊和鸡犬，填进‘中央’肠。
    箱倒柜儿开，说找共产党，
    衣服和财物，件件一扫光。
    谁若讲讲理，耳光打的响。
    妇女被奸淫，丑恶没法讲。
    见了青壮年，强迫把兵当，
    口吐一不字，说是共产党，
    托枪向着你，就要把命伤。
    亲尝‘中央’味，认清贼老蒋，
    ‘中央’号遭殃，名称极恰当。
    我年已古稀，不能上战场；
    这是我孙孙，略长把兵当。
    参了八路军，加入共产党，
    一定报仇冤，消灭贼老蒋！”
    翁言话至此，哽咽不能详。
    我也没言语，略作安慰腔。
    通过好些家，屎尿极肮脏；
    屋内和院里，全都是一样。
    不觉暗落泪，饮食也不想。
    如今已两周，犹记不能忘。
    写出登报端，告知众老乡。
