    Shi Yuying, a cadre family member from the Postal Headquarters, came to the Headquarters with her husband last February. Because she had a cultural foundation equivalent to the third grade of elementary school, she wanted to live at the school to study. The organization also felt she had potential for development and decided to subsidize her with 45 jin of rice per month to live at the school. However, expenses such as clothing, food, and stationery still had to be found by herself. Therefore, she took the time to sew clothes for the elderly, earning 2,600 yuan, which solved these problems. In August, she became a publicly funded student. This year, the number of publicly funded students at the school was reduced, and the organization also tightened its expenditures. Family members adopted a policy of self-sufficiency through production, so Shi Yuying could no longer live at the school. At first, she was not very understanding and felt dejected. However, after the mobilization meeting for production and thrift in the organization, and influenced by the practical actions of her comrades, her thinking changed. She said, "Studying hard is to be able to work and serve the masses. It's better to produce something now to reduce public expenses, which is also for the benefit of the people." She started spinning cotton... spinning more every day. Now she can spin 12 liang of thread every day.
    She also formulated a plan for production, thrift, and establishing household affairs: spin 15 jin of cotton per month, earning 500 yuan per jin, for a total of 7,500 yuan. Eating 25 jin of rice at 44 yuan per jin requires 1,100 yuan, 4 jin of flour requires 400 yuan, 1 jin of salt requires 150 yuan, and oil requires 150 yuan. After deducting 2,200 yuan in consumption, a minimum of 5,000 yuan can be guaranteed for reinvestment in production. She will not make new single-layer or cotton-padded clothes this year, but will wear the old ones. Having produced for one month, in 22 days, she spun 14 jin of cotton for villagers, earning 7,000 yuan, made two pairs of shoes and two pairs of soles. She also spun 2 jin of cotton herself and raised a chicken, which laid 20 eggs, enough for oil and salt expenses. After reviewing the plan, she felt that she could not give up studying just to focus on production. She planned to improve her skills and speed up spinning as much as possible, squeezing out time to review her lessons, so that production and learning could be combined.
    Her spirit of hard work, endurance, and active production has inspired the other cadre family members at the Postal Headquarters. Wang Meirong spun five and a half jin of cotton and has woven more than five zhang of large-sized cloth. An old lady in her seventies, who had never spun cotton in her life, has now learned and spun two jin and nine liang. The little girl Jia Su also spun five jin of thread. (Li Qiyan)

    邮总干属石玉英生产自给
    石玉英是邮务总局一个干部家属，去年二月跟她男人到总局，因为自己有相当于初小三年级的文化基础，想住学校学习，机关也觉得她有培养前途，决定每月津贴她四十五斤米让她住学，但衣服、菜金、文具费……等仍得自己设法，因此她就抽时间给老人缝衣服、赚洋二千六百元，解决了这些问题。八月又转为公费生。今年学校公费生名额减少，机关也紧缩开支，家属采取生产自给方针，这样石玉英便不能住学校了。开始她思想不很通，情绪低落，但在机关生产节约的动员大会以后，以及同志们的实际行动影响，她的思想起了变化，她说：“念好书是为了能工作来服务群众，不如现在生产些，减少公家开支，也就是为了老百姓。”他开始纺起花来……一天比一天纺得多，现在每天能纺线十二两。
    她又订出生产节约建立家务计划：每月纺花十五斤，每斤赚工资五百元，可得七千五百元。吃米二十五斤每斤四十四元，需一千一百元，四斤面四百元，一斤盐一百五十元，油一百五十元，除消耗二千二百元外，最低可保证五千元投入再生产，今年不做单衣棉衣还穿旧的。现在生产一月，二十二天给老乡纺花十四斤赚洋七千元，做成鞋两双，底子两双，自己还纺花二斤，养了一只鸡，下蛋二十颗，足够油盐费用。检查计划以后，她觉得，光顾生产不能放弃了学习，计划纺花尽量提高技术、加快速度，挤出时间来温习功课，使生产与学习结合起来。
    她这种刻苦耐劳积极生产的精神，鼓舞了邮总的其余干部家属，王美容纺花五斤半，并已织成了大尺五丈多布。一位七十多岁老太太，一辈子没纺过花，现在已学会，纺了二斤九两，小女孩贾素也纺了五斤线。（李启艳）
