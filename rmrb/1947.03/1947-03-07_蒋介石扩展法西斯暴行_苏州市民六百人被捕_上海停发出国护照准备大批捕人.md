Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Chiang Kai-shek's illegal large-scale arrest of citizens has expanded from Beiping, Shenyang and other places to Central China. According to a United Press Suzhou dispatch on the 3rd, Chiang Kai-shek's military police and secret agents, under the pretext of "checking household registration," extensively searched and arrested more than 600 citizens on the weekend (2nd).

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai News: The Preparatory Committee of the National Federation Against U.S. Military Atrocities in China convened an emergency meeting on the afternoon of February 27th to respond to the ten professors in Beiping's request to guarantee personal freedom. They issued a letter to professors and students nationwide, demanding that the Chiang government immediately release the arrested students. If this goal is not achieved, they will protest with action.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Beiping News: The "September 3rd" Society has lodged a serious protest against Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents' indiscriminate arrest of more than 2,000 residents in Beiping.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai, 2nd News: The Chiang government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered its Shanghai office to suspend the issuance of passports from March 1st, except for overseas Chinese who have obtained proof from the Chiang-controlled Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. It is generally believed that this is a prelude to the Chiang government's mass arrest atrocities in Shanghai. This kind of fascist atrocity has already occurred in Beiping and Shenyang since last month.

　　蒋介石扩展法西斯暴行
    苏州市民六百人被捕
    上海停发出国护照准备大批捕人
    【新华社延安四日电】蒋介石非法大规模逮捕市民的暴行，已由北平、沈阳等地扩展至华中。据合众社苏州三日电称，周末（二日）深夜，蒋介石军警特务假“清查户口”为名，广泛搜查逮捕市民在六百名以上。
    【新华社延安三日电】沪讯：全国抗议美军驻华暴行联合会筹备会，于二月二十七日下午召集紧急会议，响应北平十教授要求保障人身自由，当场发表告全国教授及同学书，要求蒋政府立即释放被捕学生，如目的不达，则以行动抗议。
    【新华社延安四日电】北平讯：“九三”学社为蒋介石特务滥捕平市居民二千余人，提出严重抗议。
    【新华社延安三日电】上海二日讯：蒋政府外交部已命令其驻沪办事处自三月一日起，除华侨已取得蒋记侨委会证明文件者外，其余一律停止签发出国护照。一般认此为蒋政府在沪大批捕人暴行之先声，上月以来，此种法西斯暴行已在北平、沈阳发生。
