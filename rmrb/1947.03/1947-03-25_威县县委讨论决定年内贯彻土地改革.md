[Reported from our newspaper's Jinan Office on the 23rd] The Weixian County Party Committee held a meeting on March 15th to study the situation of the rent reduction movement in the past three months. The meeting lasted for four days and clearly pointed out that the mark of victory in land reform lies not only in the return of land to the peasants but also in the ideological awakening of the peasant masses. It pointed out that because spring plowing is approaching, we should not be eager to achieve quick results and be careless. We should thoroughly break the optimistic mood and the "close enough" mentality; combine with production, completely eliminate feudalism within this year, fully mobilize the masses, and complete land reform. According to the results of the study, although the rent reduction movement in Weixian has expanded from point to area, it is still far from the comprehensive and thorough realization of land reform. For example, in the 40+ villages in the Sixth District, where the work is relatively good, only six villages, including Zhenghe, Liujiazhuang, and Wangcun, have been initially fully mobilized, and only four villages have distributed the fruits of the struggle. The masses in other villages have not yet been fully mobilized; as for whether the fruits are fairly distributed, it has not yet been checked. In the 46 villages of the Fifth District, 33 villages have not yet started mobilization. Secondly, the cadres, influenced by the idea of "completing land reform before spring plowing," are eager to achieve quick results, and often go to another village before the work in one village is done. In many villages that have been mobilized, the feudal forces have not been completely eliminated, the fruits have not been reasonably distributed, and the masses have not been fully mobilized, the cadres have already left, thinking that the major mobilization has been completed. Thirdly, there are still hundreds of small villages in the county. Many cadres believe that there are no landlords in these villages, and even if there are one or two landlord households, they have been struggled against in the last mass movement and there is no "big target" to attack, so these villages have been lightly let go. But this is not actually the case. For example, the landlord Yin Tongshan in Xiaoliuzhuang was subjected to a joint struggle by twelve villages in the last mass movement, and it was thought that the struggle was "close enough," but this time he was struggled against for an additional 20 million yuan in fruits (the price of land and houses). In addition to solving the problems of this village, it can also solve the problems of three poor villages nearby, including Majiazhuang and Jixiaohe. Jiang Luorui in Jiangjiazhuang and Li Luochun in Fujiazhuang are all hidden landlords who still rule over the masses in their villages. There is no doubt that, based on the above three points, the county committee unanimously believes that it is necessary to deeply implement land reform and strive to complete it thoroughly within one year. In this year, we must concentrate all our efforts and carry it out in depth; we must achieve the goal of fully mobilizing the masses, completely eliminating feudalism, and completing land reform. To this end, first of all, cadres and activists must establish a democratic style and implement the mass line. Mobilizing struggle, distributing fruits, and reorganizing organizations must all go through the conscious movement of the masses. Secondly, it is necessary to correctly lead the masses in classifying class status because many landlords have dispersed their land in various ways to evade burdens, narrow targets, and confuse the peasants. The basis for classifying landlords is mainly the method of operation, the amount of wealth, and the historical context. For example, if a landlord has changed his status, it is necessary to see whether he normally participates in labor. If he does not have hired labor now, but he himself does not normally work, and the land is barren, or although he labors, his wealth is still equivalent to that of a rich peasant or a landlord, then it is necessary to consider the historical context to determine his class status. Thirdly, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize the "honest peasants" and mobilize women, and distribute to them the fruits they need. Cadres at all levels must dispel all concerns and consciously support them. It is necessary to select typical examples, convene meetings of several villages or the entire district, and joint meetings of village representatives to conduct demonstrations, and use facts to open up the minds of cadres and activists, in order to fully mobilize the "honest peasants," mobilize women, and strengthen the momentum of the peasant struggle.

    威县县委讨论决定年内贯彻土地改革
    【本报冀南二十三日电】威县县委于三月十五日举行会议，研究三个月以来查减运动状况，历时四天，明确指出土地改革胜利的标帜，不仅在于土地回家，同时在于农民群众的思想觉悟。指出不要因春耕之将到，急于求成，马虎了事，应彻底打破乐观情绪与“差不多”思想；结合生产，于今年一年内彻底消灭封建，充分发动群众，完成土地改革。根据研究结果，威县查减运动虽已由点向面扩展，但距全面彻底实现土地改革尚远，如工作较好的六区四十多村，初步充分发动的只有郑河、刘家庄、王村等六村，分完果实的只有四村，其他村庄群众尚未充分发动；至于果实是否公平则尚未检查。五区四十六村中，尚有三十三村未着手发动。其次，干部因受“春耕前完成土地改革”的影响，急于求成，常常一村工作还没作好，便往另一村去，很多经过发动的村庄，封建势力还没彻底消灭，果实尚未合理分配，群众发动亦不充分，干部则已经离去，以为大动已经告成了。第三、全县还有百余小村，许多干部认为这类村没有地主，即便有一二户地主，上次群运中已经斗过，没有“整头”了，因此对这些村庄都轻轻放过了。实际并不然，如小刘庄地主尹同山，上次群运中对他发动过十二村联合斗争，认为斗的“差不多”了，但这次又斗出果实两千万元（土地、房屋折价），除解决本村问题外，还可解决附近马家庄、集小河等三个小穷村问题。蒋家庄蒋洛瑞、傅家庄李洛春等都是隐蔽地主，还统治着全村群众。毫无疑问，根据以上三点，县委会一致认为须深入贯彻土地改革，争取一年内彻底完成。在这一年中，要集中全力，深入进行；务要达到充分发动群众，彻底消灭封建，完成土地改革之目的。为此，首先干部、积极分子必须树立民主作风，贯彻群众路线。发动斗争，分配果实，整理组织等，都要经过群众自觉的运动。第二、要正确领导群众划分阶级，因为有很多地主为逃避负担、缩小目标，曾以各种办法疏散土地，迷惑农民。地主划分根据，主要是经营方式，财富多寡和联系历史，如地主变了成份，要看他是否正常参加劳动，现在虽无雇工，本人仍不正常劳动，土地荒芜，或虽劳动而其财富仍相当于富农于地主的就要联系历史来决定成份。第三、要大力发动“老实农民”，发动妇女，分给他们需要的果实。各级干部必须打消一切顾虑，有意识的为他们撑腰，要选择典型，召开几村或全区大会，和村代表联席会，进行示范，用事实打通干部积极分子的思想，以达到充分发动“老实农民”，发动妇女，壮大农民斗争声势。
