　　[Jinnan Dispatch, 18th of this month] The Jinnan Daily recently published an editorial stating: After the district party committee called on cadres to return cheaply bought or excessively distributed gains, twelve counties responded actively in less than twenty days. The Julu County Committee conscientiously reviewed its actions, set an example, and resolutely returned cheaply bought gains to the masses. Some counties convened district and village cadres for introspection, and some county and district cadres openly reviewed their actions at mass meetings, returning the gains. These exemplary actions influenced village cadres to also return excessively distributed or borrowed gains, which is very good. It pointed out that cadres in various regions should continue to vigorously promote the "return gains" work. First, recognize that cadres returning gains is a matter of the relationship between cadres and the masses. If cadres gain too much, the masses will be dissatisfied, but when district and village cadres return cheaply bought or excessively distributed gains to the masses, the masses immediately express, "This is truly implementing democracy!" turning dissatisfaction into support. Secondly, cadres returning gains is related to implementing land reform. If buying cannot be handled fairly, attempts to further eliminate remaining landlords, implement land reform, enter large-scale production, and unleash the masses' enthusiasm for supporting the front lines will be in vain. Thirdly, cadres returning gains is actually helping cadres to consciously improve themselves a step. Many of our district and village cadres are meritorious and glorious; however, due to coming from various rural families and being in a rural feudal remnant environment for a long time, they have engaged in actions such as cheaply buying or excessively distributing gains, infringing on the interests of the masses. This is a stumbling block to cadres' progress. We must resolutely and bravely smash the stumbling block, thoroughly examine and correct our mistakes, resolutely return excess gains, and make ourselves politically progress greatly.

　　冀南日报发表社论
    鼓励干部退出多得果实
    【本报冀南十八日电】冀南日报近发表社论称：区党委号召干部退回贱买或多分果实之后，不到二十天即有十二个县积极响应。巨鹿县委认真检讨，以身作则，坚决把贱买果实退还群众。有的县召集区村干部进行反省，有些县区干部在群众大会上公开检讨，把果实退还。这种模范行动，影响村干也退出多分、借用的果实，这都是很好的。指出各地干部应继续大力推动“退果实”工作；首先认识干部退回果实，是干部与群众关系问题，干部多得果实群众不满，但当区村干部把贱买、多得果实退给群众之后，群众马上表示“这才是真正实行民主哩！”变不满为拥护。其次，干部退果实，关系着贯彻土地改革问题。如果买不能公平处理，想进一步消灭遗漏地主，贯彻土地改革，进入大生产与发挥群众积极支援前线就会落空。第三、干部退回果实，是从实际上帮助干部自觉的提高一步。我们的区村干部，不少是有功的光荣的；但由于出于农村的各样的家庭，又长期处在农村封建残余的包围中，因此发生贱买或多分果实，侵犯群众利益的行动，这是阻碍干部进步的绊脚石。我们要坚决勇敢的粉碎绊脚石，彻底检查与纠正自己的错误，坚决退回多得果实，使自己政治上大进步。
