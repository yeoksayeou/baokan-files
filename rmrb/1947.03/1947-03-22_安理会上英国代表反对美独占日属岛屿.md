Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Chenggong Lake News: During a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on the afternoon of the 12th, British representative Cadogan raised new objections to the US trusteeship of Japanese-held Pacific islands. After elaborating on the UK's objections to the economic clauses of the US plan, the British representative argued that the principle of equal opportunity should be explicitly included in non-strategic and strategic trusteeship agreements. Chinese and British representatives have formally submitted a proposed amendment to the Security Council to curb US commercial priority in trust territories, stating that the UK will reserve the economic status granted to the US in the US trusteeship islands plan. On the same day, New Zealand and India simultaneously requested to participate in the Security Council's debate on the former Japanese mandated islands. The Indian government, in its letter to the Security Council, requested a delay in the discussion to allow all non-Security Council members to state their views on the US draft trusteeship. Finally, the Security Council decided to invite five countries, New Zealand, India, Canada, the Netherlands, and the Philippines, to participate in the discussion of the case and postponed the debate on this issue to the 17th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: TASS, London, 14th: Walter Fletcher, a Conservative Party member who recently returned to Britain after a seven-week stay in China, published an article in the *Manchester Guardian*, stating that the current situation in China has led the United States to find the Japanese reactionaries better than the Kuomintang. The United States is working to establish Japan as the equivalent of the 49th US state. Japan will be their main strategic base for establishing an anti-Soviet stronghold. Japan can produce first-class goods cheaper than anywhere else in the world, selling well in the Far East. In the future, it seems likely that the Japanese will become both producers and cannon fodder.

    安理会上英国代表反对美独占日属岛屿
    【新华社延安十八日电】成功湖讯：联合国安理会十二日下午开会时，英代表贾德干对美国托管太平洋日属岛屿事提出新的反对意见。英代表在详陈英国对美方针刺经济条款的反对意见后，主张机会均等的原则，应明文列入非战略及战略托管协定，中英代表已正式向安理会提出一修正案建议，抑制美国在托管领土上之商业优先权。并称：英国将保留美方计划中所给予美国托管岛屿的经济地位。同日纽西兰与印度同时提出要求参加安理会关于前日本委任统治岛屿的辩论，印度政府在其致安理会函中要求延缓讨论以便一切非安理会理事国的陈述其对美国托管草案的意见。最后安理会决定邀请纽、印、加、荷、菲五国参加该案之讨论，并将此问题辩论日期展至十七日。
    【新华社延安十六日电】据塔斯社伦敦十四日电称：在中国逗留七周后最近返英之保守党党员瓦尔特·佛勒契在《曼建斯特卫报》上发表了一篇文章，其中有云中国目前的情况，使美国发现日本反动派较国民党为佳，美国正努力使日本成立类似美国的第四十九州，日本将是他们建立反苏据点的主要战略基地，日本可产生较全世界按价钱低之头等货物畅销远东，日本人在将来似可能成为生产者又成为炮灰。
