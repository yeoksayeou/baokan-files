　　Taihang Administrative Office Issues Instructions for Winter Schools to Transition to People's Schools
    [Our newspaper's report from Taihang, 13th] The Taihang Administrative Office recently issued instructions to the entire region regarding the transition of winter schools to people's schools. The instructions pointed out that last year's winter schools played a significant role in serving the war effort, land reform, production, enlightening the masses' class consciousness, and establishing new ideas. Currently, they should be transformed into permanent people's schools to educate farmers after their liberation and consolidate their new thinking. Educational methods should not only focus on reflection and grievance airing but should further inspire class consciousness, encouraging people to "be masters of their own destiny" and "become new heroes," promoting their patriotic and self-defense spirit of valor. It is also important to establish the idea of "building a prosperous family and establishing a career on a solid foundation." With the current domestic struggle situation being extremely tense, the self-defense counter-offensive about to begin, Chiang Kai-shek further leaning on the United States, and his inevitable failure in the future, the people's schools should greatly publicize these issues. Continue to implement education against the false constitution, the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, and the stationing of American troops in China. All cultural institutions in the villages (mass blackboards, loudspeakers, reading groups, rural theater troupes, etc.) should be reorganized and unified under leadership. Each special county should mobilize "Li Youcai"-like figures in the countryside to create clapper talks and folk songs, composing, teaching, singing, and performing them as they go. People's schools should become discussion forums for the central work of the masses and meeting halls for cadres and the masses to discuss matters. Volunteer teachers must be 100% active members of the mass movement, and cadre study groups and youth tutorial classes should be organized on a large scale.

　　太行行署指示冬学转为民校
    【本报太行十三日电】太行行署顷向全区发出冬学转民校指示：指出去年冬学在服务于战争、翻身、生产启发群众阶级自觉，树立新思想上起了很大作用，目前应即转为经常的民校，教育翻身后的农民，巩固其新思想。教育方法不仅反省诉苦，而应进一步启发阶级自觉“自作主人”、“作新英雄”，发扬其爱国自卫的尚武精神。并树立“兴家立业按富根”思想；对当前国内斗争形势空前紧张自卫反攻即将到来、蒋介石进一步投靠美国及其必然失败前途，民校中应大大宣传。继续贯彻反伪宪，反蒋美商约及美军驻华的教育。各村所有的文化机构（大众黑板、广播筒、读报组、农村剧团等）均应整理，统一领导。各专县应发动农村中“李有才”编快板、歌调，随编随教、随唱随演。民校应成为群众中心工作的讨论会，干部群众的议事厅。义教必须百分之百是群运中的积极分子，并应大量组织干部学习小组和青年补习班。
