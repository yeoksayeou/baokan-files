After the masses were emancipated, the share capital of cooperatives in various villages in the Seventh District of Zuoquan increased greatly. To meet the needs of the masses for production and prosperity, village cooperatives pooled 2.9 million yuan to establish a district cooperative. Zhen Laishuan, manager of the cooperation model Suicheng Village Cooperative in the district, was selected as the manager of the district cooperative. Furthermore, emancipated peasants in the district requested improvement in cultural education and collected 220,000 yuan from the fruits of their struggle to establish a private senior primary school. The funds were also invested in the district cooperative for production. If funds are insufficient, the county will subsidize part of it. The school has now opened in Suicheng with a freshman class of 35 students. Because many children of peasants are requesting admission, there are plans to add a preparatory class.

　　左权七区成立区联社创办高小一所
    群众翻身后，左权七区各村合作社股金均扩大甚多。为适应群众生产致富要求，各村社特集资二百九十余万元成立区联社，选全区合作模范粟城村合作社经理甄来拴任区社经理。又该区翻身农民要求提高文化教育，特从斗争果实中集基金二十二万元创办民办高小一所。基金亦投入区联社进行生产。经费不足时由县补助一部。现该校已在粟城开学，有新生一班三十五人。因农民子弟要求入学者甚多，拟再增设一预备班。
