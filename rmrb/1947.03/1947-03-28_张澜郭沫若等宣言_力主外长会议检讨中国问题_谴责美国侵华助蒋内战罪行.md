Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 25th: According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on March 23rd: Prominent Chinese democrats Zhang Lan, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, and many other well-known university professors, scientists, etc., recently published a declaration in the Dagong Bao regarding the discussion of the China issue at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, stating that the Chinese people do not reject fair and well-intentioned mediation. The declaration stated: They oppose those who, under the guise of mediation, assist one side of the conflict and prolong the Chinese civil war, as the United States has done. The declaration cited many facts to prove that the United States continued to provide the Kuomintang government with economic and military assistance after the victory over Japan. It pointed out that the Chinese people demand that the United States change its policy towards China for this very reason. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, recently reorganized from the Third Party, also issued a declaration, clarifying its attitude towards the current situation in China. The declaration first pointed out that the current problems in China must be resolved on the basis of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and then stated: "Our attitude towards the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference is that every self-respecting Chinese and truly independent Chinese must oppose foreign interference in China's internal affairs, especially any assistance to any party with the purpose of provoking and encouraging the Chinese civil war; however, we do not oppose at all any fair and well-intentioned mediation from friendly countries that can bring peace and democracy to China." Mr. Zhang Dongsun, Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, stated in an interview with reporters in Beiping that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference must discuss the implementation of the December 1945 Moscow Conference's statement on the cessation of the Chinese civil war and the establishment of a coalition government.

    张澜郭沫若等宣言
    力主外长会议检讨中国问题
    谴责美国侵华助蒋内战罪行
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据塔斯社上海二十三日电：中国著名民主人士张澜、马叙伦、郭沫若、沈钧儒、章乃器及其他许多著名大学教授、科学家等，顷就莫斯科外长会议研讨中国问题一事，于大公报上发表宣言，声称中国人民并不拒绝公正而善意的调解。宣言称：他们反对那些在调解的掩饰下协助冲突一方，而延长中国内战的人，如像美国做的那样。宣言摘引许多事实，证明美国在战胜日本后，仍给予国民党政府以经济与军事的援助。指出中国人民要求美国改变对华政策，也正是此一理由。新近由第三党改组之农工民主党亦发表宣言，阐明其对中国目前局势之态度。该宣言于首先指出中国目前问题必须以政协为基础加以解决后，继称：“我们对莫斯科外长会议之态度，我们明言每一自尊的中国人与真正独立之中国人，必须反对外国对中国内政的干涉，特别反对任何人以挑起及鼓励中国内战为目的的对任何方面的援助；但是，我们完全不反对任何友邦的可以给中国带来和平与民主的公正而善意的调解”。民盟秘书主任张东荪氏于北平接见记者时发表谈话，力主莫斯科外长会议必须研讨四五年十二月莫斯科会议关于中国内战必须停止与组织联合政府声明的执行问题。
