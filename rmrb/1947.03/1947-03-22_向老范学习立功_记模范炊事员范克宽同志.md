    Learning from Lao Fan to Achieve Merit
    ——A Record of Model Cook Fan Kewan
    Méicūn
    At the administrative staff meeting, an old man in greasy clothes, with a ruddy complexion and vigorous spirit, walked onto the stage with a smile and an air of great importance. Everyone fixed their eyes on him. He naturally raised his fist and said loudly, "Don't think I'm old. I don't dare to compare with everyone in other aspects, but let's compare work! I, Lao Fan, am not bragging; watch what happens!"
    This is Fan Kewan, the top model administrative worker just elected by everyone. He is a 53-year-old cook in the School Headquarters of our Military and Political University. In the campaign to achieve merit, I feel that he should be introduced to everyone, so that everyone can learn from his example of achieving merit.

  I. “Work hard,” “Study hard!”
    He often advises everyone to "work hard, work loyally, and work with peace of mind." He said, "To serve the people, you must do this. As long as you work hard, the people will not mistreat you. There is a great future in doing revolutionary work!" He has been involved in the revolution for over ten years (coming from the Northeast Army in 1936). His comrades who used to cook with him are now either sergeants or quartermasters, but he is still a cook. However, he never cares about status or power. He said, "Revolutionary work is not divided into big or small. As long as you do it well, you will be equally respected."
    If you ask why he is always a cook, he has a good answer himself: "I didn't study hard, and I can't even recognize a few words, let alone write a note. How can I be a cadre?" Recognizing this, he began to value learning. He often advises those young devils who don't study hard: "I, Lao Fan, have suffered a lot in my work because I didn't study hard and couldn't read! You young people must study hard!"

  II. “Hardworking Work Style”
    Although he is over fifty years old, everyone praises his work ethic. Last summer, he was the head of the cooking squad in the School Headquarters. For a few days, there were only four cooks left due to illness, while there were more than 160 people to feed, including the large and medium canteens. He led the four people, getting up early and going to bed late, sacrificing their noon naps. He personally cooked large pot dishes, medium canteen meals, and sick meals. Meals for guests and those returning from business trips were also made by him personally. He also fed pigs, carried water... From morning to night, long after the lights-out bugle had sounded, he was still busy in the kitchen. Under his influence, the other four people worked very hard and did their work beautifully, so that everyone's meals were not affected. Later, he went to work in the small canteen. There were many guests in the small canteen, and he was even busier cooking alone. But he didn't mind the trouble and fatigue at all, and he happily cooked every meal perfectly. When the school moved, the organization decided to let him ride in a car because he was old, but he refused. He said, "Let others ride, I can walk!" He didn't sit in the car at all along the way. He ran all the thousand-mile journey on his own two legs. He was old, and his legs were clumsy, so walking was naturally very difficult, but he thought, "Better to have the meal waiting for the people than the people waiting for the meal, no matter what." This high sense of responsibility urged his legs to hurry forward. Therefore, although he always had to wait for the team to go a long way before he could pack up the pots and pans and start off each time, he always arrived at the campsite about two hours earlier than the team. When the leaders arrived, water and meals were prepared in every detail, without affecting the leaders' lives at all. After the school moved to the new location, he worked as a master chef in the small shop. Every day, in addition to making various dishes and meals, he had to fry more than ten pounds of sesame candy and bake twenty pounds of flatbread. He got up before dawn and stood by the pot to work until midnight before resting. He often couldn't eat on time. He was still busy when everyone else had finished eating for a long time.

  III. Not One or Two Extra Grains of Rice!
    He said to me, "To be truly loyal to the people, you must pay attention to conservation and cherish every thread and needle of the public's property! For example, when studying, if you don't know how to write a word, first use a firewood stick to draw on the ground, practice until you know it, and then write it in the notebook, without wasting even a small piece of paper." When he cooked, he planned first, not adding one or two extra grains of rice, and not adding an extra bowl of water. He said, "If you add too much rice, you can't finish it, and it's all wasted. If you add too much water, you waste firewood." Before he went to the small canteen, the small canteen used to burn more than 100 kilograms of coal a day. After he arrived, he felt that it was too wasteful, so he thought of ways to save. First, he modified the stove, making the grate higher in the front and lower in the back, in a sloping shape, so that the fire would burn easily; he left a finger-width gap between the grate bars, so that the raw coal that was not thoroughly burned would not leak down; when lighting the fire, he did not light it from the top down, which would have caused the raw coal to fall down, but from under the grate, he hooked out the thoroughly burned, blackened, and weak charcoal piece by piece, not letting a single piece of raw coal leak down. In this way, he only burned seventy kilograms of coal to cook the same amount of food without using the bellows. After going to the small shop, he still paid attention to saving. Every day, one large pot and two small pots, he burned from before dawn until midnight, averaging only forty kilograms of firewood.

  IV. Willing to Work in the Eighth Route Army for a Lifetime!
    He has been away from home for seventeen or eighteen years. When he left, he left behind his old mother and wife. He hadn't seen them all this time, and he was so old himself. But he never thought of retiring and being demobilized, and he didn't even have the idea of asking for leave to go home and visit. In fact, his home was only about three hundred li from the garrison. This time, the march was not far from his home, but he didn't go back to take a look. Some comrades advised him, "Lao Fan, you should go back once!" But he said sternly, "I am over fifty years old this year, and I can't do it for many more years. The revolutionary cause is not finished yet! The work is so busy, work is the most important thing, and going home is a small matter!" At the end of last year, he asked to join the Communist Party. He said, "I have been in the Communist Party's army for more than ten years, and I know that the Communist Party is wholeheartedly serving the people. The Communist Party is my home, and I am willing to work in the Eighth Route Army for a lifetime!..." Now, he is a glorious Communist Party member who serves the people for life.

    向老范学习立功
    ——记模范炊事员范克宽同志
    梅村
    在事务人员大会上，一个穿着一身油腻衣服，红光满面，精神勃勃的老头子，微笑着，气昂昂地走上台子。大家把眼睛都看着他，他很自然地把拳头一挥，大声说：“别看我老了，其他方面不敢和大家比，咱们比工作！我老范不吹牛，以后看事实！”
    这是才被大家选出的头名模范事务工作者——范克宽同志，我们军政大学校部五十三岁的老炊事员。在立功运动中我觉得应当把他介绍出来，让大家学学他立功的榜样。
  一、“好好干”，“好好学！”
    他常劝大家“要艰苦工作，忠心工作，安心工作。”他说：“为人民办事，就要这样。只要你好好干，人民不会亏你的，干革命工作，最有前途了！”他参加革命十来年了，（三六年从东北军过来的），从前和他一块作饭的同志，如今，有的当上士了，有的当司务长了，而他仍是一个炊事员，但是，他从来不计较地位高低，职权大小，他说：“革命工作，不分大小，只要干的好，一样受尊敬。”
    要问为什么他老当炊事员呢？他自己有个很好的问答：“自己不好好学习，根本斗大的字不识一升，连个条子都开不了，怎能当干部？”认识了这一点，他对学习就重视起来了。而且常劝那些不努力学习的小鬼们：“我老范因为学习不努力，不识字，在工作中不知吃了多少苦头！你们年青青的，可要好好学啊！”
  二、“艰苦的工作作风”
    他虽然五十多岁了，但他的工作精神，谁提起来都连声称赞。去年夏天，他在校部当炊事班长。有几天，炊事员病的只剩下四个人了，而吃饭的人，大灶加中灶，却在一百六十口以上。他领导着四个人，早起晚睡，午觉也牺牲了。他亲手作大锅菜，中灶菜饭，和病号饭。来了客人，出差回来的饭，也都是他亲手去作。外带着还喂猪，担水……从早到晚，吹过息灯号很久了，他还在厨房里忙碌着。在他的影响下，其他四个人，都干的很起劲，把工作做的漂漂亮亮的使大伙的伙食没受到影响。后来，他到小灶工作。小灶客人多，他一个人做饭，更忙了。但他丝毫不嫌麻烦和疲劳，高高兴兴的，每顿饭都作得呱呱叫。学校搬家的时候，因为他年纪大，组织上决定叫他坐车走，可是他不坐。他说：“让别人坐吧，我可以走！”一路上，屁股没有挨到过车上。千把里路程，全是用两条腿跑的。他年纪大了，腿笨了，走起来自然是很艰难的，但是，他心里想：“能叫饭等人，不叫人等饭，无论如何。”这种高度的工作责任心，催着他的两腿，拚命往前赶。所以，虽然每次出发，他总得等队伍走好大一会了，才能将锅碗收拾停当，开始动身，而每次到达宿营地时，他却总是比队伍早到两点钟左右。首长们一到，水、饭都预备的周周到到，一点也不影响首长的生活。学校到新驻地以后，他在小铺当大师傅。每天，除作各种菜饭外，要炸十几斤面的麻糖，打二十斤面的饼子。三更起床，一起来，就站在锅边工作，一直到半夜才休息。饭，经常不能按时吃，大家都吃过饭好久了，他还忙着没吃饭呢。
  三、不多下一两米！
    他对我说：“真正对人民忠心，就要注意节约，爱惜公家的一针一线！比如学习的时候，不会写的字，先用柴棒棒在地上划，练会了再写到本子上，连一小块纸头也不浪费。”他作饭的时候，先计划好，不多下一两米，不多添一碗水，他说：“米下多了，吃不完，都糟蹋啦，水添多了，费柴火。”他未到小灶以前，小灶一天要烧一百多斤煤炭。他去以后，觉得那样太浪费，便想办法节省。首先改造炉灶，把炉条垫的前面高后面低，成斜坡形，使火容易烧旺；把炉条间，留上一指宽的缝，使烧不透的生煤块，不会往下漏；通火时，不从上面往下通，这样把生煤都通下去了，而从炉条底下，将烧透发黑乏炭，一块一块往下勾，不让一块生煤漏下去。这样一来，每天作同样多的饭，不用风箱只烧七十来斤炭。到小铺以后，仍然注意节约。每天一口大锅，两口小锅，从天不明烧到半夜，才平均烧四十斤柴火。
  四、愿意在八路军里干一辈子！
    他离开家十七八年了，出来时，家中丢着老母妻子，一直没有见过面，自己年纪又那末大，可是，他从来没想到要退伍复员，连请假回家看看的念头也没有。其实他家离驻地才三百来里。这次行军离家门不远，他也没绕回去看一眼。有的同志劝他：“老范，应该回去一趟呀！”他反而严正的说：“我今年五十多岁了，再干不了多少年了，革命事情还没干完哩！工作这样忙，还是工作要紧，回家是小事呀！”去年年底，他要求参加共产党。他说：“我在共产党的军队里十几年了，我知道共产党是一心一意给老百姓办事的，共产党就是我的家，我愿意在八路军里干一辈子！……”现在，他已经是一个终身为人民服务的，光荣的共产党员了。
