Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 6th: The Kuomintang's reorganized 77th Army's 59th Division, which occupied Zaozhuang and Guoliji to its southeast, launched a northward offensive in separate routes on the morning of the 3rd of this month, once again attempting to encroach upon the Lunan mountainous area. After suffering a heavy blow from the People's Liberation Army, the remnants retreated in a panic towards Fengxian County, and both locations were thus recovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang, 6th: Yan Xishan's 19th Army unit Yu Zhenhe, which had invaded Wenshui County, was subjected to a devastating blow (suffering 1,000 casualties) at Dongshetun, 40 li northwest of Wenshui City. On the evening of the 1st, they led parts of Yan Xishan's 40th Division, 39th Division, and 66th Division, a total of four units, to flee north to the vicinity of Shihou Town (15 li south of Jiaocheng). As a result, Wenshui County and Kaishan, an important town on the Taiyuan-Fenyang line, were liberated once again.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 6th: Tian Fengshan, the platoon leader of the 3rd Platoon of the 7th Company of a certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Field Army, led his entire platoon in self-defense during the Baonan Campaign. He was exemplary in military command, prisoner of war work, and battlefield discipline. (1) He was flexible in command, made use of terrain and features, and acted nimbly and bravely. In three battles, at the cost of one death and one injury, he killed and captured 180 enemies, exceeding his own numbers. In political work, he was good at winning over enemy troops. For example, in the Shijiatuan battle, he repeatedly applauded to welcome the enemy to surrender. An enemy battalion commander surrendered with more than 50 men. In the Dingxian battle, he organized these newly liberated soldiers to shout and persuade Kuomintang soldier Guo Shaowen to surrender. He then sent Guo Shaowen to Xiguan to shout, winning over more than 100 Kuomintang soldiers. (2) Battlefield discipline was strict. For example, in the Shijiatuan battle, someone picked up a fan, and the platoon leader immediately told him to put it down. The execution of the prisoner of war policy was also exemplary. Due to the outstanding leadership of Platoon Leader Tian and the bravery of the soldiers, in the first month of this year's battles, the platoon not only completed its annual merit-earning plan of annihilating the enemy and seizing weapons, but also exceeded the original plan by 100%.

　　鲁南蒋军背腹受敌
    我军收复枣庄
    晋中再克文水城开栅镇
    【新华社华东前线六日电】侵占枣庄及其东南之郭里集的蒋军整编七十七军五十九师，于本月三日晨分路北犯，再次企图进窥鲁南山区，当遭人民解放军予以重创后，残部向峰县城方向狼狈溃退，该两地即告收复。
    【新华社吕梁六日电】侵陷文水县城之阎军十九军于镇河部，于距文水城西北四十里之东社遭歼灭打击（损失千人）后，于一日晚率阎军四十师、三九师、六六师各一部共四个部北窜至石候镇（交城南十五里）一带，至此文水县城及太（原）汾（阳）线上之重镇开栅再获解放。
    【新华社晋察冀六日电】晋察冀野战军某部七连三排长田凤山，在保南战役中，领导全排自卫战争，在军事指挥、俘虏工作、战场纪律各方面均堪称范例。（一）指挥灵活，利用地形地物，动作机动勇猛，三次战斗中以牺牲一人、伤一人的代价毙俘敌人一百八十名，超过自己人数。在政治工作上善于争取敌军，如十家疃战斗数次鼓掌欢迎敌人缴枪，敌人营长率五十多人放下武器，定县战斗即组织这些新解放战士喊话，争取蒋军郭绍文放下武器，又立使郭绍文至西关喊话，争取过来一百多蒋军。（二）战场纪律严明，如十家疃战斗有人拾到一把扇子，排长见了立刻叫放下。执行俘虏政策亦称模范，由于田排长的杰出领导及战士的英勇果敢，在今年第一个月的战斗中，该排不仅已完成歼敌缴枪的全年立功计划，并超过原计划一倍。
