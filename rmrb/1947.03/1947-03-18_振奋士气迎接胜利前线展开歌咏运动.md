　　【Report from Jilu豫 Frontline, 16th】 To boost morale and greet victory, our frontline troops are enthusiastically launching a singing campaign. A certain unit, in its instructions calling for the widespread development of singing, pointed out: Majestic singing can encourage our army's morale, and the lyrics are also excellent political teaching materials, which can concisely and clearly teach the troops why our army is fighting, the excellent traditions of our army's relations with the people, officer-soldier relations, and combat style. Therefore, we must create military songs that meet current requirements and let them be sung widely in the troops. The unit has now begun practicing and is rushing to print the first collection of "People's Liberation Army Songs," widely soliciting contributions. Deputy Political Commissar Zhang is extremely concerned about the singing movement. He believes that singing is a manifestation of morale. In the past, the Chinese Red Army often sang very majestic songs that were suitable for the current tasks and situations. Songs quickly reflect reality. Often when enemies face each other across the mountains, our singing is loud and clear, and our morale is high. The enemy is lifeless and dispirited, giving the enemy a great mental threat. He talked about the problem of singing folk songs, believing that folk songs are for the peasants, and the peasants who have just joined the army naturally like folk songs. However, in the army, their lives have also changed, and folk songs cannot express the content of life in the army. Therefore, the troops must sing majestic military songs, not folk songs, which is a further combination of spirit and military life.

　　振奋士气迎接胜利前线展开歌咏运动
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】为振奋士气，迎接胜利，我前线各部队刻正热烈展开歌咏运动。某部在号召广泛开展歌咏指示中指出：雄壮的歌声能鼓励我军士气，歌词又是很好的政治教材，能把我军为什么而战，我军军民关系、官兵关系、战斗作风等优良传统简明扼要教导部队。因此我们要创作适合当前要求的军歌，让部队中普遍唱起来。现该部已开始练习，并赶印“人民解放军歌集”第一集，普遍征集稿子。又张副政委对唱歌运动，极表关心，他认为歌唱就是表现士气。以前中国红军经常唱着非常雄壮的，适合当前任务、情况的歌子。歌子很快的反映现实，常常敌我对峙山头，我们是歌声嘹亮，士气昂扬。敌人死气沉沉，士气不振，给敌人精神上很大威胁。他谈到唱小调问题，认为小调是农民的，刚参加部队的农民自然喜欢小调。但在部队里，他们的生活也改变了，小调不能表现部队的生活内容了。因此部队中一定要唱雄壮的军歌，不能唱小调，这是在精神上进一步和军事生活的结合。
