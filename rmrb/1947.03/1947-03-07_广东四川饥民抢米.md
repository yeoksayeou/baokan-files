Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th -- According to reports in the Shanghai press: On the 17th of last month, an incident occurred in Yingde County, northern Guangdong, in which 600 famine victims seized 70,000 *shi* of rice. This was because the price of rice in Guangdong was soaring at the time (note: in mid-last month, the price of rice in Guangzhou surged from 70,000-80,000 per *shi* to 160,000), making it impossible for the poor to live. Rice merchants were transporting rice purchased from Hunan via the Beijiang waterway to Guangzhou, and when they reached the county's territory, all the rice was seized by the famine victims. Furthermore, according to reports in the Chongqing press, in Beimu Town, Neijiang, Sichuan, hundreds of famine victims boarded boats to seize rice in January. This was the third large-scale rice seizure incident in southern Sichuan since December, with the previous two occurring in Rongchang and Longchang.

　　广东四川饥民抢米
    【新华社延安四日电】据沪报载：粤北英德县上月十七日发生六百饥民抢米七万石事件，因是时广东米价高涨（按：上月中旬广州米价每市石由七八万猛涨达十六万），贫民无法生活，适有米商由湘购米取道北江水路运广州，至该县境时，被饥民全部抢去。又据渝报载，四川内江碑木镇，一月间亦有饥民数百人上船抢米，此为十二月以后川南第三次大规模抢米事件，前两次发生于荣昌、隆昌。
