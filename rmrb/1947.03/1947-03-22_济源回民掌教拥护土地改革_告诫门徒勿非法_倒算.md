    Jiyuan Hui Religious Leader Supports Land Reform
    Warns Followers Not to Illegally "Reverse the Settlement"
    [This from our newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] Mr. Ma Yulong, a religious leader of the Hui people in Jiyuan, praised the land reform in the liberated areas and warned some of his followers not to be deceived by Chiang Kai-shek into carrying out "reverse settlement" against the peasants. The Xiagjie Village area of Jiyuan is a Hui minority area. Before the War of Resistance and under the rule of the enemy and puppets, the Hui people suffered the same oppression and devastation as the local Han people, and their lives were extremely miserable. After the Japanese surrendered and the Chiang army crossed north, the Hui compatriots were subjected to brutal oppression, and many mosques were burned down by enemy agents. At the beginning of the land reform, the Hui people also surged into the movement, uniting with the local peasants to fight against feudal forces. However, a small number of Hui landlords, deceived by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda, actually carried out "reverse settlement" against the peasants. Mr. Ma Yulong told reporters: The Communist Party not only does not interfere with the household registration and beliefs of the Hui people, but also leads the Hui people to stand up, share the fruits of the struggle, and establish their own Hui peasant associations and militia. We are very grateful; those "reverse settlement" elements are all traitors to Islam.

    济源回民掌教拥护土地改革
    告诫门徒勿非法“倒算”
    【本报太岳二十日电】济源回教掌教马玉龙先生盛赞解放区土地改革，并告诫某些门徒勿受蒋介石欺骗向农民进行“倒算”，济源下街村一带为回民区，抗战前及敌伪统治时，回民与当地汉民同样遭受压迫蹂躏，生活痛苦不堪。日寇投降，蒋军北渡，回胞受到残暴的压迫，清真寺多被敌特焚毁。土地改革一开始，回民亦风起云涌卷入运动，与当地农民团结一致向封建势力斗争。但少数回民地主因受蒋介石欺骗宣传，竟向农民进行“倒算”。马玉龙先生对记者说：共产党不仅不干涉回民的户籍与信仰，并领导回民翻身，分得斗争果实，建立回民自己的农会与民兵，我们非常感谢；那些“倒算”分子，皆是伊斯兰的叛徒。
