　　First Battalion of the Democratic National Construction Army
    Officers and Soldiers Work Together to Accumulate Manure and Boost Production
    [Report from this newspaper] To welcome the spring plowing season, the Democratic National Construction Army launched a manure accumulation campaign. One battalion collected 2,850 baskets of manure in one week. Wang Zexiu, the Second Battalion Commander of the 13th Regiment of the Second Army, went for a run outside the village during morning exercises. He saw a pile of cow dung on the way. Since he didn't have a bag, he picked four corn husks, wrapped the dung, and carried it back on his backpack. Everyone laughed and asked him what it was. He said, "This is my production fund." Hao Jiaoguo, the platoon leader of the × platoon of the Second Company, challenged the battalion commander. In the middle of the night, he carried a manure basket to the outside of the village and collected a load of manure. Before dawn, he went to ×× Town, which was eight li from the garrison, and collected another load. The soldiers carried manure baskets whenever they went out. Once, Sun Fakui went to the military headquarters to practice bayoneting, but he forgot to bring his manure basket. He wrapped the manure in something and brought it back. (Wang Liangyi)

　　民主建国军第一营
    官兵齐动手积肥闹生产
    【本报讯】为迎接春耕，民主建国军展开积肥运动，一个营一星期拾粪二千八百五十筐。第二军十三团第二营长王则修，早操时到村外跑步，半路上见了一堆牛粪，没带袋子，就拾了四个玉茭叶，把粪包住，放在背包上带回来。大家都笑着问他是什么？他说：“这就是我的生产基金。”二连×排排长郝交国提出了与营长挑战，半夜就担着粪筐到村外拾了一担粪回来天还不明，又到离驻地八里的××镇拾了一担回来。战士们只要是出门就背着粪筐。有一次孙发魁到军部驻地去剌枪，忘带粪筐，他就把粪用东西包着带回来了。（王良义）
