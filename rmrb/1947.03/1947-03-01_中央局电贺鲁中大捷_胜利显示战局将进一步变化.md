　　Central Bureau Cables Congratulations on the Great Victory in Central Shandong
    Victory Shows Battlefield Situation Will Further Change
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] The CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau telegraphed congratulations on the great victory in Central Shandong. The original telegram is as follows: Comrades Chen Yi, Su Yu, Rao Shushi, Li Yu, and forwarded to all commanders and fighters of the Shandong People's Liberation Army:
    Chiang Kai-shek exhausted all his strength in the Shandong campaign. As soon as you struck, you captured Hao Pengju alive, and in the Battle of Laiwu, you captured Li Xianzhou alive, annihilating as many as seven divisions of the enemy. This severely taught the American-Chiang alliance and the like of Chen Cheng and Xue Yue that they cannot save their ever-deepening military crisis. The battlefield situation is showing that further changes are about to occur. The liberated areas and the people of the whole country are cheering and inspired by your unprecedented and glorious victory. We hereby send a telegram to congratulate you and wish you to continue your efforts and win even greater victories!
            With regards from the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau
          (February 27)

　　中央局电贺鲁中大捷
    胜利显示战局将进一步变化
    【本报特讯】中共晋冀鲁豫中央局电贺鲁中大捷，原电如下：陈毅、粟裕、饶漱石、黎玉诸同志并转山东人民解放军全体指战员同志：
    蒋介石用尽了一切力量进行的山东会战，你们一出手就活捉了郝鹏举，而莱芜之役又生擒李仙洲，歼敌达七师之众，严重的教训了美蒋及陈诚、薛岳之流休想挽救其愈益深重的军事危机，战局正在显示即将发生进一步的变化。解放区和全国人民均为着你们这一空前的辉煌胜利而欢腾鼓舞，谨电驰贺，并祝你们再接再厉，胜上加胜！
            中共晋冀鲁豫中央局有感
          （二月二十七日）
