[This article transmitted from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 7th] The Chiang Kai-shek troops that have once again invaded the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are now mired in a sea of guerrilla warfare. According to incomplete statistics, the Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Military Sub-districts alone annihilated a total of 838 enemy soldiers in February, recovering three enemy strongholds including Junjia in Hua County. On February 3rd, a regiment of our Sixth Military Sub-district attacked the enemy puppet stronghold of Hongmiao, north of Qihe City, annihilating over 360 puppet soldiers of Li Lianxiang's unit. On the 10th, a unit of local armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district recovered the enemy strongholds of Zhuanjia and Yinmiao in Hua County, killing over 200 enemy soldiers including a battalion commander. On the 22nd, a regiment of the Eighth Military Sub-district recovered the enemy puppet stronghold of Xiaoyuzhuang (southwest of Jingdian) in Gaoling County, killing over 50 puppet soldiers including the puppet district chief Qingchi, and capturing over 70. The masses in the suburbs of Puyang City are currently organizing joint defense to strictly prevent the Chiang Kai-shek puppets in the city from looting grain. Land reform in the Seventh Military Sub-district is in full swing, and guerrilla warfare is being carried out on the basis of the Spring Transport. After the enemy occupied Jiaxiang, the masses in the suburbs of the city still persisted in the struggle to divide land and grain.
