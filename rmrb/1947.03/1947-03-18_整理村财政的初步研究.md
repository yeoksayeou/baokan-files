　　Preliminary Research on Reorganizing Village Finances
    Tian Lin
    Many places have already begun to implement the new policy of village funds being raised and managed at the village level, with self-sufficiency in production and no collection from the masses. This is a new direction in financial and economic work and should be universally promoted. But how exactly should this policy be implemented and carried out? Based on materials from various places, the following points are made:

    I. Ideological Mobilization and Education: To implement this new policy is a revolution in concepts and working styles, not an easy task. Therefore, ideological education should run through the entire process of reorganizing village finances and establishing a new system. The significant meaning of reorganizing village finances and reducing the burden on the people for the self-defense war and land reform should be explained, mobilizing all the masses to reorganize, establishing a collective concept of everyone managing affairs, everyone becoming prosperous, and everyone supervising, as well as a sense of ownership. Secondly, based on class consciousness, village cadres should be educated to transform their past simple administrative orders for mobilization and apportionment, and their work style of simply asking the masses for things, raising it to a concept of serving the masses.

    II. Clearing Public Property: This work must rely on the masses; cadres alone cannot do it well. On one hand, cadres are mobilized to confess their hidden assets without punishment, and on the other hand, mass inspections are carried out. In Dongguan, Xiyang, many problems such as hidden assets, embezzlement, random spending, and random borrowing were discovered, breaking the past perception that Dongguan had no public property. Xiangyuan also cleared out 250,000 jin of hidden grain and cotton, and more than 2,000 pairs of military shoes, adding a large financial production fund. However, when clearing, the village public property should be separated from the county public property and the fruits of struggle. At the same time, when recovering old debts such as loans and warehouse grains, poor households and rich households should also be treated differently.

    III. Establish and Strengthen Village Financial Management System, establish a Village Financial Management Committee, implement mass management, combine top-down approval with bottom-up supervision, and formulate precise budgets, tightening expenditures, and not spending where expenditures can be avoided. The Taihang Second Special District stipulates that village administrative, construction, and education expenses are set by the county, the village makes a budget, the district reviews it, and the county approves it; other necessary expenses such as military service must also be approved by the district, and the village shall not arbitrarily mobilize apportionments or spend wastefully. In some places in Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region), the village income and expenditure of each village are posted in the market for comparison and public criticism, which is very good.

    IV. Combining Financial Management with Production: This is the basic method of financial resources, and many places have already started doing this. The gains from reorganizing public property and saving can be used as funds for investment in production, and its profits can be used for village expenses. Wang Village Chief of Puyang County, Jilu豫, spontaneously created this method, so that schools could be run and militiamen could buy bullets without asking the masses for money, and the masses only paid five jin of rice per mu as village funds. Licheng used methods such as reclaiming wasteland, planting land, and opening workshops to make the village funds self-sufficient, and also organized the masses to produce and pay local funds. After Xiyang Dongguan accurately calculated and saved 130,000 yuan, it invested the cleared public property in production, and it is estimated that the income this year will be enough to cover all village expenses. Wang Village within the dike in Ji County, because of the frugality of the cadres, the masses, in addition to public grain and public firewood, no longer have any burden, and only used the half-year village funds issued by the county last year to support the work for the whole year. In addition, organizing the families of martyrs and soldiers to produce and establish family businesses is also an important way to reduce village expenditures.

    Wherever this new policy has been implemented, it has greatly reduced the burden on the masses, enabling the masses to invest the fruits in production, purchase production tools, livestock fertilizers, seeds, etc., which not only improves the farmers' production enthusiasm, but also enriches the material strength and directly supports the patriotic self-defense war.

　　整理村财政的初步研究
    田林
    许多地方已开始实行村款村筹、生产自给，不向群众征收的新方针，这是财经工作上一条新的路线，应普遍推广。但究竟如何实行并贯彻这个方针呢？根据各地材料，有如下几点：
    一、思想动员与教育：要实行这个新方针是一个观念、一套作风的革新，不是一件容易的事情，因此思想教育应贯串整理村财政建立新制度的全过程。应说明整理村财政减轻民负对自卫战争及土地改革的重大意义，动员全体群众来整理，树立大家当家、大家发家、大家监督的集体观念及主人翁思想。其次从阶级自觉基础上，教育村干转变过去简单的行政命令的动员摊派，单纯向群众要的工作作风，提高为群众服务观念。
    二、清理公产：这个工作必须依靠群众，光干部是搞不好的。一面以谈出来不处罚动员干部自报，一面进行群众性检查。昔阳东关发现埋伏、贪污、乱支、乱借等问题甚多，打破了过去认为东关没公产的看法。襄垣亦清理出埋伏粮食、棉花二十五万斤，军鞋两千多双，增加了一笔大的财政生产基金。但在清理时应将村公产与县公产和斗争果实分开，同时在收回借款、仓谷等旧欠时，贫户和富户亦要分别对待。
    三、建立并加强村财政管理制度，成立村财政管理委员会，实行群众性的管理，由上而下的批准与由下而上的监督相结合，并制定精确预算，紧缩开支，可以不开支者即不开支。太行二专区规定村行政、建设、教育费三项由县规定标准，村作预算，区审核，县批准；其他参军等项必须开支亦须经区批准，村不得随意动员摊派，亦不得随便开支浪费。冀鲁豫有的地方将各村村款收支在集市上放榜，互相比较并让群众批评，都是很好的。
    四、财政管理与生产结合：这是财源的基本办法，很多地方已经开始这样作了。整理公产和节约所得即可以作为基金投入生产，而以其利作为村经费。冀鲁豫濮县王庄村长即自发的创造了这种办法，以致办学校、民兵买子弹都不向群众要钱，群众每亩地只出五斤米作村款。黎城以开荒、种地、开作坊等办法村款自给外，并组织群众生产交地方款。昔阳东关精确计算节约十三万元后，又将清理出的公产投资生产，预计今年所得利益足够全部村款开支。冀县堤内王村由于干部节约，群众除公粮、公柴外，再不出任何负担，仅以去年县里发给的半年村经费支持了全年工作。此外组织烈、军属生产建立家务，也是减轻村开支的一个重要办法。
    凡是实行此新方针的地方，已大大减轻了群众负担，使群众将果实投入生产，购置生产工具、牲口肥料、种籽等，不仅提高了农民生产情绪，而且也就是充实物质力量直接的支援了爱国自卫战争。
