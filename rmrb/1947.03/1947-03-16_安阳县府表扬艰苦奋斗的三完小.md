　　Anyang County Government Commends Third Elementary School for Hard Work
　　[This newspaper, Anyang news] Anyang Third Elementary School's faculty, staff and students have overcome difficulties through work-study programs, continued their studies, and actively participated in mass movements, earning commendation from the county government. This school was only established last spring. Just as the school was taking shape, it was caught in the aggression of the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops against Shuiye, Guantai, and other areas of the county. Even the location of the Third Elementary School was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops. The school relocated while organizing all teachers and students to propagandize to the masses on the road, explaining the reasons why the Chiang army was bound to be defeated and we were bound to win, stabilizing the people's morale. They moved to a dilapidated temple in a remote mountain gully, with nothing. They immediately divided up to collect firewood, build stoves, and make door curtains, transforming the ancient temple into a school building. The educational content also changed with the war, focusing on war preparedness, air defense, battlefield first aid, telling stories of the Red Army's Long March, the inevitable defeat of the Chiang army, and the atrocities of the American army. Due to the development of the war, the school relocated to She County for the second time. Being unfamiliar with the place, the difficulties were even greater. The school then proposed combining study with production to overcome the difficulties. All students engaged in mutual labor assistance between themselves and between students and faculty. In three days, they chopped more than 4,500 catties of firewood, worth more than 31,500 yuan (local currency), solving the firewood shortage. At this time, it coincided with the land reform movement in Taicang Village, but the masses were not fully mobilized. The school then put forward the slogan "Help local farmers to stand up," using the facts of landlords oppressing and exploiting peasants to raise everyone's awareness, and organized everyone to participate in the mass movement in the village. At the struggle meetings, poor students all told of their own suffering, shouting the slogan "The landlords of She County are the landlords of Anyang, and landlords everywhere are like little Chiang Kai-sheks!" They also gained a lot of knowledge from the farmers' struggle, overcoming some students' incorrect understanding of the mass movement. The school has now gloriously received awards and commendation from the Anyang County Government. (Anyang Education Section)

　　安阳县府表扬艰苦奋斗的三完小
    【本报安阳讯】安阳三完小全校教职学员变工生产解决困难，继续学习，并积极参加群运，获得该县政府表扬。该校是去春才创办的，学校刚刚搞成个样子，就赶上蒋伪向该县水冶、观台等地进攻，连三完小的所在地亦被蒋伪侵占了，学校一面搬家，一面组织全体师生在转移途中向群众进行宣传蒋军必败我们必胜的道理，安定群众情绪。他们转移到山沟内四邻不靠的一座破庙里，什么也没有，即分头拾柴、修火灶、打门帘……，将古庙修成校舍。教育内容也随着战争转变为备战、防空、战地救护、讲红军长征故事、蒋军必败、美军暴行等。由于战争发展，学校第二次转移到涉县，人生地不熟，困难更多，该校乃提出学习与生产结合来克服困难，全校同学间，同学与教职员间，都实行变工。三天割柴四千五百多斤，合洋三万一千五百多元，解决了烧柴困难。这时正赶上太仓村的填补运动，群众未充分发动起来。该校即提出“帮助本地农民翻身”的口号，以地主压迫剥削农民的事实来提高大家觉悟，又组织大家参加本村群众运动。斗争会上，贫苦同学都诉出自己的痛苦，喊出了“涉县地主即是安阳地主，不管那里地主都是小蒋介石”的口号；他们又从农民斗争中增长了许多知识，克服了部分同学对群运的不正确认识。该校现已光荣获得安阳县府奖励与表扬。（安阳教育科）
