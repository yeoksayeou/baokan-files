　　【Our Newspaper Pingshun News】After the land reform in Pingshun, universal attention was paid to the rectification and transformation of the militia, absorbing activists who had been tested in struggle to participate in the militia, changing the composition of the militia since the War of Resistance Against Japan, and transforming some cadres' old attitudes towards the militia. The transformation of the militia in this county went through a complex struggle process. In the past, cadres generally loved "neatness", young people in groups, sectarian views, fearing that poor old men would be troubled by serving in the militia, and included many landlords and bad people. In this test of the fiery emancipation, the awakened emancipated peasants of Chengguan were very worried about the militia handling cases. After a leadership inspection, it was found that there were six landlords and two feudal rich peasants in the militia. In the process of struggle, it was universally discovered in Beipo in the Fifth District and Sitou in the Sixth District that the militia colluded with landlords and hid ingots and wealth for the targets of struggle, which aroused the attention of cadres and launched a mass movement to examine the militia. The Armed Committee of the Sixth District proposed "Who can defend the fruits of emancipation?" overcoming the idea of the Sitou cadres not paying attention to the class composition of the militia. The masses and cadres unanimously agreed to cleanse six landlords and four rich peasants, and absorb new emancipated households to strengthen the militia. At the end of the county-wide movement, a total of 559 militiamen were cleansed, and more than 1,400 new militiamen joined, establishing a strong peasant armed force of more than 6,000 people. In Tongyugou in the First District, there were as many as seven pairs of father and son soldiers. The emancipated peasants consciously demanded to take up arms to defend their fruits. Military属 Ren Binglin had mobilized two sons to go to the front line, and after emancipation, he asked his third son to join the militia. The Geng Shuiling brothers in Caozhuangou, two of his elder brothers joined the army, and all the brothers joined the militia. The masses in Shimen Village automatically took out five dan of grain to buy weapons and establish armed forces to fight against old Chiang. The political rectification and military training movement of the militia in various places is now beginning. On February 1st, the militia self-defense team of Dongshiziling in the Third District held a military training competition to select models. In the First District, fifty militiamen from Zhangjing took a grenade throwing test, and the average result was 38.3 meters per person. At present, the villages are enthusiastically carrying out offensive and defensive combat exercises to meet the self-defense counter-offensive.

　　平顺普遍整顿民兵
    坚决清洗地主不可靠分子大量吸收经过考验的农民
    【本报平顺讯】平顺经过土地改革，普遍注意对民兵的整顿和改造，吸收经过斗争考验的积极分子参加民兵，改变了抗日战争以来的民兵成份，转变了一些干部对民兵的旧态度。该县改造民兵曾经过复杂斗争过程，过去一般干部对民兵存在着爱“整齐”，年青人一伙伙，宗派观点，怕穷人老汉当民兵出差麻烦，容纳不少地主坏人在内。在这次翻身烈火考验中，城关觉悟翻身农民，即对民兵看案子很不放心，领导上一检查，果然发现民兵内有六个地主、两个封建富农。在斗争过程中，五区北坡、六区寺头等地普遍发现民兵与地主勾搭，替斗争对象掩藏元宝资财，才引起干部注意，开展了群众性审察民兵运动。六区武委会提出“谁能保卫翻身果实？”克服寺头干部不注意民兵阶级成份的思想，群众干部一致同意清洗了六个地主、四个富农，吸收新翻身户壮大民兵。全县运动结束，共清洗民兵五百五十九人，新参加民兵则在一千四百人以上，建立起一支数达六千余人的强大农民武装。一区童峪沟父子兵即达七对之多，翻身农民纷纷自觉要求拿起武器保卫果实。军属任炳林已动员两个儿子上前线，翻身后又叫他三儿加入民兵。草庄沟耿水岭弟兄六个，他两个哥参军，兄弟都参加了民兵。石门村群众自动拿出五石粮食买武器，建立武装打老蒋。各地民兵正开始政治整训和练兵运动。三区东十子岭民兵自卫队二月一日举行练武比赛评选模范，一区张井五十个民兵投弹测验结果，每人平均三十八米三。现各村为了迎接自卫反攻进行的攻防战斗练习，正热烈进行中。
