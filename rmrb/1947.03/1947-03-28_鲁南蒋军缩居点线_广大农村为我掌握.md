Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th: The raging people's guerrilla warfare in the Lu Nan area is forcing seven divisions of Chiang's troops to retreat to points and lines. Currently, from the banks of the Yi River in the east to the side of the Longhai Railway in the south, and reaching the edge of Weishan Lake in the west, including the rear and periphery of Chiang's troops between Linzao, Taizao, and both sides of the Jinpu Railway, the vast rural areas remain in the hands of the people. Cadres of the democratic government and militia are persisting in the slogan of fighting in place. The command headquarters, working teams, explosive teams, and farmland protection teams in various counties are leading the people to take the initiative in combat, forcing Chiang's troops to retreat to a few points and lines such as Xin County, Zaozhuang, Teng County, Zou County, Qufu, and Lanling. The important transportation and supply line for the invading Chiang's troops, the highway between Lin (County) and Zao (Zhuang), is being severely threatened by the people of Zhao Bo (Xin County) and other counties. Two-thirds of the area within these two counties is free of the enemy. Local armed forces and militia in Pi County have compressed the Chiang-puppet security forces into the city and a few strongholds, and spring plowing is proceeding as usual throughout the territory. The Song Zuo Ru explosive team, active on the railway line from Lincheng to Zaozhuang, killed or wounded 44 Chiang soldiers in just eight days. Working teams are frequently appearing in the outskirts of Zaozhuang.

    广大农村为我掌握
    【新华社山东二十六日电】鲁南地区如火如荼之人民游击战争，逼使蒋军七个师兵力只能退缩于点线上，现东起沂河岸边南至陇海路旁西抵微山湖畔间，包括临枣、台枣和津浦铁路两侧之蒋军后方与边缘区内，广大农村仍在人民手中，民主政府干部及民兵在坚持原地斗争的口号下，各县之指挥部武工队爆炸队保田队领导人民主动作战，已逼使蒋军退缩至新县、枣庄、滕县、邹县、曲阜、兰陵等少数点线中。现进犯蒋军之重要交通补给线临（县）枣（庄）间公路正遭受赵博（新县）等两县人民严重威胁，两县境内三分之二地区无敌踪。邳县地方武装及民兵，已将蒋伪保安队压缩城内及少数据点中，全境仍照常进行春耕。活跃在临城至枣庄铁路线上的宋左儒爆炸队，八天内即杀伤蒋军四四名。枣庄外围武工队则经常出现。
