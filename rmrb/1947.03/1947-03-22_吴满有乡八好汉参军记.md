    The Story of Eight Heroes from Wu Manyou Township Joining the Army
    Zhang Chao
    After the labor hero Wu Manyou returned from the Yan'an County Standing Committee meeting, he kept thinking about the county magistrate's call to defend the border region at the meeting. After much deliberation, he decided halfway that he would let his eighteen-year-old son, Zhonggui, join the army. Back in the village, he only discussed it with his fourth brother, Manyin. Manyin was the platoon leader of the militia and eagerly requested to sign up; however, he was the housekeeper and the leader of the family's production, so after repeated dissuasion from the old hero, he had to give up. This happened at the end of October; by the beginning of November, the old hero had signed up for his son at the mobilization meeting of the Liulin District government, and he also said to the crowd: "The people in our district must set an example and sign up more. If Hu Zongnan hits us once, we will hit him twice!" These few words moved everyone. Within a few days after the meeting, eight heroes from Wu Manyou Township alone signed up to join the army.
    Wu Zhonggui was in the fifth grade of Yan'an City Elementary School. On the afternoon of the day the district held the meeting, he suddenly received a notice from his father. Zhonggui was originally an enthusiastic young man, and this news was exactly what he wanted. He immediately packed his luggage and hurried home. That night, the old hero convened a family meeting and announced that Zhonggui would join the army. At first, everyone was a little stunned, but after the old hero explained the reasons, and Zhonggui and Manyin chimed in, it was passed. Only Zhonggui's newly married wife lowered her head and remained silent. After the meeting, someone said to Zhonggui: "You should explain it to your wife properly—" The new wife heard this and her face flushed red, and she hurriedly whispered in defense: "No need to explain! I'm not that kind of woman!" After Zhonggui returned home, he went to the east village and the west village every day, talking to new recruits day and night, and he really didn't spend much time at home. When the villagers saw that the Wu family had such a heroic father and a good son, and also a sensible and reasonable new wife, they all praised them.
    In addition to Wu Zhonggui, there were five other heroes: Li Yuejun from Shaoyuan Village, a poor peasant; Miao Yangye; Liu Erbao from Qiugou Village; Liu Dahai, the nephew of Liu Jianzhang; and Song San from Qiushuta. The original plan of six people was already full. Who knew that later, an old farmhand of Wu Manyou (Wu had three farmhands, Zhang Shenglang, age twenty-seven. This man had been a soldier in Yulin at the age of fourteen). He couldn't stand the corruption of the Kuomintang army and the oppression of soldiers, so he escaped to Yan'an to find work in his tenth year. This year, he agreed with Wu Manyou to work for ten months, and he had already worked for eight months and fifteen days. This time, seeing the master's son and many young people signing up to join the army, he was eager to try, but it was difficult to speak up because the work period had not yet expired. After the first villagers' meeting in Wu's jujube orchard to call for joining the army, he decided to sign up. At that time, coincidentally, Song San, who had signed up, asked to withdraw his name due to family difficulties. One day, the township government was discussing this matter, and Zhang Shenglang ran over and quietly squatted aside listening. The township head, Ji Fa, found it very strange and asked: "You're not going to suffer, what are you squatting here for?" Zhang Shenglang stammered and replied: "I want to be a soldier, see if you want me?" The township head said: "If we want you, but we have to see if you meet the conditions." "What conditions do you want?" "Gamble?" "No!" "Drink!" "No! There's no such thing for sure!" "Why do you want to be a soldier?" "Good you township head, if young people don't go to fight Chiang Kai-shek, who will go?!" The township head saw that he was strong and nimble, and immediately agreed to him. Zhang Shenglang ran back to the jujube orchard to seek the old hero's consent. The old hero beamed with joy and replied repeatedly: "Okay! Okay! Why didn't you say so sooner? … Okay, I don't want the wages for these forty-five days!"
    The next day, a symposium was held in Wu's jujube orchard. Kuizhuang donated 500,000 border currency and bought a lot of melon seeds and wine to celebrate the new soldiers. Zhang Shenglang said to the crowd: "I've been in this village for two or three years, do you have any opinions about me? In our People's Army, we must listen carefully to everyone's criticism." The crowd saw his heroic appearance and his humility, so they didn't mention his small mistakes this time, and they all replied in unison: "No objections at all." "He is good at enduring hardship!" "You must be a good soldier." … Wu Zhonggui interjected at this time: "Folks, when we go to the front to fight, you must do a good job in the rear, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and then come back and live a peaceful life with everyone, do you think that's right?" "Right!" A burst of applause rang out in the cave. Then they served wine and melon seeds, talking and laughing, very lively. Song San, who originally wanted to slip away, also came to participate that night, and seeing this scene, he felt very regretful. He stood up from the corner and said: "I still want to go, but my family..." Before he could finish speaking, everyone shouted one after another: "If your family has difficulties, everyone will take care of them, go with peace of mind!" "You are going to fight for everyone, how can everyone watch your family starve to death?!" So Song San re-enlisted in the army.
    On the day before they were about to leave for the army, Liu Dafu, a farmhand from Yangjiapan, also rushed over. He was the second nephew of the cooperative hero Liu Jianzhang. Hearing that his uncle had persuaded his older brother, Dahai, to join the army, he hurriedly rushed to the Nantong Cooperative to ask his uncle if he could still sign up. Liu Jianzhang was naturally overjoyed and told Dafu to hurry to the township government to sign up.
    On the day of departure, wine tables were set up in each village along the road, like a festival. The men and women, old and young, in each village were already waiting at the entrance of the village. When the eight heroes arrived, they swarmed up, stuffing melon seeds, peanuts, cigarettes, and fried cakes into all the heroes' pockets, without even having time to say thank you. The old man Wen Huaixiang from Miaohe personally served wine to the eight heroes, constantly chanting blessings: "After drinking this cup of promotion wine, I wish you all good health and kill more enemies!"

    吴满有乡八好汉参军记
    张潮
    劳动英雄吴满有，开罢延安县常驻议会回来，一路思量着县长在会上保卫边区的号召，左思右想，半路上就拿定主意叫他十八岁的老生儿仲贵去从军。回到庄来，单找四弟满银商量。满银是自卫军排长，争着要求报名；可是他是管家的，又是全家生产的领导人，经老英雄再三劝阻，只得罢休。这是十月末尾的事；到了十一月初，老英雄便在柳林区政府的备战会上替儿报了名，还向众人说道：“咱们区里的人要起个模范，多报些名。胡宗南打咱一锤，咱便给他两锤；”几句话，说的众人个个动情。会后不到几天，单吴满有乡就有八个好汉报名从军。
    吴仲贵正在延安市完小五年级念书，区上开会的那天下午，忽接到父亲通知，仲贵原是个热心青年，这一看，正中了他的下怀。当即收拾行李，急忙回家。当晚老英雄召开家庭会，宣布仲贵从军。开头众人不免楞住，待老英雄把道理说明，仲贵和满银又在旁一唱一和，也就通过。惟有新娶的仲贵媳妇低首不语，会后有人对仲贵说道：“你该好好跟婆姨解释一番——”新媳妇在旁听见，满脸飞红，急忙低声分辩道：“用不着解释！我才不是那号婆姨女子！”仲贵回家后，天天走东村、转西庄，白日黑地找新战士拉话，也确实没在家里待过多少时间，村人见吴家有这样英雄老子好汉儿，又有懂事明理新媳妇，莫不众口赞扬。
    除了吴仲贵，还有五个好汉就是：稍园梁贫农李月俊、苗养业，湫沟贫农刘二宝、刘建章的大侄刘大海、湫树塌的宋三。原来计划的六名已足了额。谁知后来蓦地又出来一个吴满有的长工（吴有三个长工，张生良，年纪二十七。此人十四岁上就在榆林当兵）他看不下国民党军队的腐败和欺压士兵，第十年逃来延安揽工。今年给吴满有说好揽工十个月，已经做了八个月零十五天，这回看到主家的儿子和许多青年人报名从军，又跃跃欲试，无奈工期未满难以开口。在吴家枣园第一次开村民会号召从军后，就决心报名，当时凑巧有个报了名的宋三提出家境困难要求撤名。一天，乡政府正在讨论这件事，张生良竟跑来悄悄ｋē＠①蹴了在一边听着，乡长纪发觉得很奇怪，问道：“你不去受苦，ｋē＠①蹴在这哒作啥？”张生良吞吞吐吐的答道：“我想当兵，看你们要不要？”乡长道：“要是要，不过要看你够不够条件。”“你说要些啥条件？”“赌不？”“不！”“喝吧！”“不！这号事保险没有！”“你为啥要当兵？”“好你乡长咧，年青人不去打蒋介石，谁去打么？！”乡长见他强壮又利洒，马上答应了他。张生良撒腿就跑回枣园征求老英雄同意，老英雄眉飞色舞，连应道：“成！成！你为啥不早说？……好吧，这四十五天工我也不要了！”
    过了一天吴家枣园开座谈会，奎庄募捐了五十万边币，买了许多瓜子和酒，欢送新战士，张生良向众人道：“我在这庄盛了二三年，你们对我有啥意见没？咱人民军队，一定要好好听大家批评。”众人见他这般豪杰模样，又如此虚心，这回也就不提他小过错了，齐声应道：“一满没意见。”“是好受苦人么！”“你一定是个好战士。”……吴仲贵此时插话道：“乡亲们，咱们上前方打仗，你们要做好后方工作，打垮了蒋介石，再回来和大家过太平日子，你们说对不对？”“对！”窑洞里响起了一片掌声。接着看酒递瓜子，又说又笑，好不热闹，原想抽腿不去的宋三，这夜也来参加，眼见这番情景，十分懊悔。他从角落里站起来，说道：“我还是愿意去，不过我家里……”众人不等他说完，你一言我一句的嚷了起来：“家里困难有大家照应，你放心去！”“你去打仗是为了咱们大家，大家还能眼看你家里人饿死？！”于是宋三重新报名从军。
    到了动身入伍前一天，杨家畔竟又赶来一个揽工刘大福。他是合作英雄刘建章的二侄，听说叔老子劝哥哥大海从了军，急忙赶到南通合作社来，问叔老子还能不能报名，刘建章自然喜出望外，叫大福赶紧到乡政府报了名。
    起程那天，沿着大路各村都摆下酒桌，像过节一般，各村男女老少早已候在村口。待八名好汉来到，便一拥而上，瓜子、花生、纸烟、油炸糕，往好汉们所有袋里乱塞，连说声谢谢也来不及。庙河的温怀祥老汉亲自给八名好汉看酒，口里不断念着祝词：“喝完这杯高升酒，祝各位身体健康，多杀几个敌人！”
