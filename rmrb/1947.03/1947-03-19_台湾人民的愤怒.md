The Anger of the Taiwanese People

After Japan surrendered, Chen Yi's first gifts to the people of Taiwan were a considerable number of Fujianese and a large number of "plans."

However, the "takeover" work was unexpectedly "lenient" towards the Japanese. They took the opportunity to conceal some of the weapons they were originally prepared to hand over in the mountains, scattered tens of thousands of rifles and short guns in various places, and moved away quite a bit of movable materials and equipment. Now, many Taiwanese are worried that the Japanese will one day riot, make a comeback, and invade again.

In all the many "taken over" factories and farms, Japanese technical personnel were retained, and the management of the factories remained the same. Truly, almost everything relied on the enemy.

Under the "benevolent rule" of the Chiang family, the so-called "economic construction" began, starting with the unified control of "rice" and "sugar," which caused many adventurers who came to Taiwan seeking gold to run into a wall. The Chiang government inherited six of the eight original Japanese monopolies (camphor, tobacco, alcohol, salt, matches, weights and measures), plus the unified control of import and export trade, forcing Taiwanese industrialists and businessmen who had concentrated capital to withdraw from these enterprises automatically. Land and property were transferred from the Japanese prefectural government to Chen Yi's "Governor-General's Office," only changing the name; "seals" and monopolies meant that factory chimneys no longer emitted smoke. To this day, most of Taiwan's industrial production is still at a standstill; some private firms and factories are preparing to close down one after another, while a small number are converting to small factories, manufacturing tinplate, cork, and so on, eking out a living! According to figures released by the Chiang government authorities, the important industrial product of cane sugar produced only 80,000 tons last year, less than one-tenth of its peak period. The special product camphor manufacturing industry has completely stopped. The Chiang government seems to feel that this kind of "favor" to the Taiwanese is not enough, and pulls the blood-stained hands of the Americans to strangle the Taiwanese people's throats. Last November, Bradley, the head of the American Sugar Industry Survey Group, came to Taiwan to "study cane sugar," and gave Keelung Port to the United States for "direct trade." The Keelung Customs authorities were ordered to officially open up Japanese cargo ships. In January, Canada also concluded a draft agreement with the Chiang government on steel industry cooperation. In short, the Chiang government wants to loot and sell Taiwan completely!

Under the fascist rule of the Chiang government, the People's Association, the Farmers' Association, and many other folk organizations promoting the democratic movement, which had a broad mass base, were dissolved. Special agents ran rampant. Young people often "disappeared" and their whereabouts were unknown. Official cars changed owners. Open robbery and secret plunder, corruption and smuggling filled the entire island. Few people in the Chiang government in Taiwan were not immensely wealthy. These were all the blood and sweat of the Taiwanese people, who became even more emaciated.

Now factories are closing down one after another, followed by massive layoffs. In addition, there are staff reductions in government agencies, and more and more people are returning to their hometowns from other provinces, making the unemployment problem even more serious. In early November last year, the number of unemployed in Taiwan reached 600,000 to 800,000, accounting for one-tenth to one-eighth of the province's population. Recently, prices have soared, and the food problem is extremely serious. The price of rice per catty has risen from 18 Taiwan dollars in January to 60 Taiwan dollars (each dollar is equivalent to 36 Chiang coins). Students at National Taiwan University have been eating porridge for several days. Ordinary civil servants are also in great distress. The people are suffering from hunger and cold, and robbery cases are emerging one after another. Those forced to take risks posted slogans such as "Officials take the oil, we rob."

Taiwanese compatriots, today they deeply understand that the master of the past was the Japanese robber, and the master of the present is the upstart of the four major families.

Moreover, there were not as many unemployed, nor such high prices, nor such severe hunger and death during the Japanese rule; therefore, the Taiwanese people turned their anger into resistance. Workers became involved in labor unrest because they could not make a living. Labor unrest also occurred in the tobacco, alcohol, and camphor bureaus of the Monopoly Bureau, the cement fertilizer plant of the Resources Committee, and factories belonging to several provincial companies. The outbreak of the "February 28th Incident" further illustrates that the Taiwanese people launched a desperate armed resistance against the greedy and tyrannical rule of the four major families.

### 台湾人民的愤怒

　　台湾人民的愤怒
    日本投降以后，陈仪到台湾首先带给人民的礼物是不少的福建人和大批的“计划书”。
    可是“接收”工作却使日寇出乎意料之外的“宽大”。他们便趁机把本来预备交出的武器部分地隐蔽到山地里去，把成千成万中短枪散藏在各处，把可以搬的物资器械也搬去了不少。现在许多台湾人都在担心着日寇有一天会暴动，会卷土重来再侵略。
    在所有计多“接收”的工厂农场里，都保留了日寇的技术人员，工厂的管理也仍依旧。真的，几乎一切都靠敌人了。
    在蒋家“德政”下，所谓“经济建设”开始了，首先是“米”和“糖”实行了统制，使很多到台湾来淘金的冒险者碰了壁。日本原有的八种专卖，蒋政府就继承了六种（樟脑、烟、酒、盐、火柴，度量衡器具），加上进出口贸易的统制，使得集中了资本的台湾本土工商业家，只好自动退出这些企业。土地产业从日本的县督府转移到了陈仪的“长官公署”只是换了一个名子，“封条”与垄断，使得工厂的烟囱再也不冒烟了。到今天台湾工业生产大部仍在停工状态，某些民间商行、工厂正纷纷准备歇业，小部分则改营小型工厂，制造铁皮，软木塞之类，苟延残喘！工业重要产品蔗糖，据蒋政府当局发表数字，去年仅产八万吨，不及全盛时期的十分之一。特产樟脑制造业已全部停顿。蒋政府这种对台湾人的“恩惠”还似乎觉得不够，再把美国人的血手拉来扼到台湾人的咽喉上，去年十一月间美国糖业考察团长勃莱迭斯就到台湾来“研究了蔗糖”，又把基隆港给与美国“直接通商”，基隆海关当局更奉令正式开放日本之货船。一月间，加拿大并与蒋政府订立钢业合作之草约。总之，蒋政府要把台湾刮尽卖绝！
    在蒋政府法西斯的统治下，拥有广大群众的人民协会和农民协会以及其他许多推动民主运动的民间团体被解散，特务分子横冲直撞、青年们常常有“失落”而不知去向，官舍汽车换了主人，明抢暗夺，贪污走私充满了全岛，台湾的蒋政府内已很少有人不是腰缠万贯的。这些刮来的都是台湾人民的血汗脂膏，台湾人民是更显得枯瘦了。
    现在工厂纷纷停闭，接着大量工人失业了，加以机关裁员，省外回籍者日渐增多，失业问题，更加严重。去年十一月初，台湾失业人数达六十万至八十万，占全省人口的十分之一至八分之一。最近物价高涨，粮食问题极端严重，米价每斤已从一月的十八元涨到台币六十元（每元折合蒋币三十六元）。台湾大学学生都已经吃了几天稀饭。一般公务员也痛苦万状。人民饥寒交迫，抢案层出不穷，被迫挺而走险者曾高贴“官揩油，我们抢”的标语。
    台湾同胞们，今天已深深了解了过去的主人是日本强盗，现在的主人是四大家族的新贵。
    而且日寇统治时代还没有这样多的失业，也没有这样高的物价，更没有这样残重的饥饿、死亡；因此台湾人民把他们的愤怒变成反抗，工人因无法生活而卷入工潮，专卖局之烟、酒、樟脑，工厂资源委员会之水泥肥料厂，以及若干省营公司所属厂家也发生工潮。“二、二八事件”的暴发，更说明台湾人民对贪婪横暴的四大家族统治展开了殊死的武装反抗。      （施＠）
