(This report from the Jinnan area, dated the 17th) In the mass emancipation movement in the Fifth District of Wucheng, a district-wide adjustment was carried out to resolve the land issues of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers. For example, in Jiama Camp Village, there were many poor military families, and their land problems could not be resolved. The leadership mobilized the masses in wealthier villages to allocate 2.5 hectares of land to be distributed to military families. In the distribution of fruits of labor, all families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the district were given a higher priority. The masses received an average of 0.2 hectares per person, while military families could receive an average of 0.27 hectares. Direct relatives of martyrs or honored soldiers could receive 0.27 to 0.33 hectares per person. Gao Qigui, a seventy-year-old member of a martyr's family in Gao Village, had a family of nine and previously only had 0.03 hectares of land. During this mass movement, he received 3.27 hectares, an average of 0.36 hectares per person. He joyfully said, "If it were under the dark government in the past, even ten of my sons couldn't earn this much. It's truly like ascending from hell to heaven!" To ensure that military families had housing, all the ancient temples and trees on temple land in the district were used to resolve the issue of building houses for military families.

　　武城五区全区调剂
    解决军烈属土地问题
    【本报冀南十七日电】武城五区在群众翻身运动中，为解决烈军工属土地问题，进行了全区性的调剂。如甲马营村贫军属多，土地问题无法解决，领导上即动员富村群众，拨去两顷五十亩地，分给军属。在分果实上，全区烈军属提高一级，有优先权，群众每人平均三亩，军属可以平均四亩，烈属或荣誉军人的直系亲属每人可分四亩到五亩。高庄烈属高其贵年已七十余，全家九口人，过去只有五亩地，这次群运中分得四十九亩，每人平均合六亩，他欢喜的说：“要是在过去黑暗政府里，我十个儿也挣不出这些东西来，真是从地狱升到天堂了。”为保证军属有房住，全区将所有古庙及庙地里的树木，统统作为解决军属建立房屋之用。
