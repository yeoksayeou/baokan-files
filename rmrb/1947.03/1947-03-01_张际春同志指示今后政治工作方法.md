　　Zhang Jichun's Instructions on Future Political Work Methods

　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After Comrade Zhang Jichun, Deputy Political Commissar, recently returned during a lull in the war and listened to reports from various departments, he convened a meeting of all staff members of the headquarters in the Military Region Political Department office at 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd, and gave extremely clear and sincere instructions on the issue of future political work methods. Although Deputy Political Commissar Zhang is on the front lines of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, persevering in tense and heavy work, his spirit is very full and his body seems healthier than before. Under the affectionate gaze of everyone, he first talked about the current war situation, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek lost forty to fifty brigades in last year's civil war, which was an extremely heavy blow to him, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to send Minister of National Defense Chen Cheng to Xuzhou to inspect and command the so-called Lunan decisive battle, attempting to salvage his collapsing crisis. But no matter how painstakingly Chiang Kai-shek plans and exhausts all means, he still cannot win battles, because politically he is carrying out a dictatorial and traitorous civil war, the hearts of the people across the country are alienated, and morale is not high. The contradiction between insufficient military strength and too broad a front in military terms is always unsolvable and increasingly serious. Chiang's army is bound to be defeated." After describing the war situation at the front, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang pointed out that the current war is characterized by a certain "seesaw" nature. Although Chiang Kai-shek adopts the method of cutting flesh to heal sores, deploying some troops for use in major areas, he still cannot escape the blow of annihilation. Our basic task is to continue to annihilate the enemy's active forces. Therefore, the gains and losses of certain cities still do not have much effect on the war situation. For example, our army's withdrawal from Linyi and the enemy's re-occupation of Juye will not have much impact on the Lunan and Luxi war situations, while our main force is always actively maneuvering. Even the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas see this very clearly."

　　Next, regarding the tasks and methods of political work this year, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang put forward extremely specific and thorough instructions. He said: "Political work, in addition to ensuring the realization of tasks such as combat, training, production and frugality, uniting officers and soldiers, uniting the military and civilians, and disintegrating the enemy army, has no other political work tasks. These tasks ultimately aim to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and win the victory of the self-defense war. The problem of political work today is not the problem of tasks, but the problem of methods. Therefore, reforming political work means reforming those working methods. Subjectivism and dogmatism in political work are errors in ideological methods and working methods."

　　"First," Deputy Political Commissar Zhang said, "based on the experience gained from exploring in the half-year of the Self-Defense War, solving problems ideologically and strengthening ideological education is the most important and most basic method in political work. Everyone knows this, and Chairman Mao pointed it out long ago in On Coalition Government. But how to do it? This requires more research." He used the work of two different columns at the front as examples, saying, "Both columns emphasized solving problems ideologically, but one specifically conducted ideological education in addition to general proposals, while the other only conducted general ideological education. As a result, the former had strength, while the latter showed no strength; the former had a great impact, while the latter did not have any major impact, and people's actions remained the same." He emphasized, "The purpose of ideological education is to transform people's thinking, awareness, and actions, so that they form a new awareness and action and become a habit. Mere general ideological education cannot play a significant role. It is necessary to commend a specific action (a reflection of thought), which is the direction we want to promote, so that people move in the right direction, and the other incorrect directions will naturally have no place. If we further appropriately criticize the incorrect directions, then people's thinking and understanding will become clearer, and greater strength will be generated. Therefore, ideological education is not about whether it is emphasized, but whether it is specifically conducted."

　　"In addition, strict organization and discipline are also necessary." Deputy Political Commissar Zhang used the implementation of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention and the actions of the troops on the battlefield as examples to illustrate that "although consciousness is the main thing, there must also be organization and discipline to unify everyone's actions and steps." He particularly pointed out: "The organization of the army is the most strict, and for the few backward elements, it is even more necessary to have organization and discipline to restrain or urge their actions. Thoughts of peace not only affect us ideologically but also cause some damage to our organization. Therefore, strengthening this aspect is also important." "Even if everyone is of one mind ideologically, it is still impossible to defeat the enemy if they are a disorganized mob organizationally." Deputy Political Commissar Zhang used such heavy words to illustrate the importance of organization and discipline.

　　"Commending heroes and models plays a significant role on the front lines. This is a working method and also one of the methods of ideological education. There have been many introductions in this regard, so I won't repeat them; the same can be universally developed in the work behind the lines." Deputy Political Commissar Zhang also pointed out: "In the current political work, it is necessary to strengthen the work of the Party Committee. Although the principle of one-yuan leadership in the army is to restore the spirit of the Gutian Conference, it is a new issue for most comrades. In this sense, it is also a new construction, and we should study it well and implement it in the army." Finally, he emphatically pointed out a point of experience in political work: "Political work is not the work of a few political workers, but the work of all Party members and soldiers. Therefore, political organs must mobilize everyone to do it. The task of political organs is to make political work, in addition to being proficient in political work, also become everyone's work and organize everyone to participate in political work. Some comrades think that political work is the work of political workers, and therefore adopt a hands-off attitude, and some political workers shut themselves off and isolate themselves, which are all wrong. It is very clear that if our military commanders or soldiers have a high political interest and development, their military work and command will also develop smoothly, because everything is built on a conscious political basis. Marshal Suvorov also believed that political awareness and morale are fundamental, which shows how urgent it is for political work to become a mass work in the position of all work in the troops!" After Deputy Political Commissar Zhang gave specific work instructions to various departments, regarding the issue of front and rear work, he said: "Both the front and rear are in the tense state of the entire war. The work is a whole and cannot be separated, and both are equally important and equally glorious. The victory on the front lines is not only the achievement of the front-line troops, but also the achievement of the work behind the lines. Although the working conditions in the front and rear are very different, the rear must naturally still support the front lines with the greatest effort today, but both the front and rear can contribute their intelligence and talents." Therefore, he called on: "Regardless of the front and rear, every comrade should use a fighting, tense mood and strive to complete the tasks in their respective work positions. In the Patriotic Self-Defense War, both the front and rear should launch a campaign to perform meritorious service."

　　张际春同志指示今后政治工作方法
    【本报特讯】张副政委际春同志最近乘战争空隙归来，听取了各部会报之后，特于二十三日上午九时在军区政治部办公室召开本部全体工作人员会议，对于今后政治工作方法问题，有极其明确的恳切的指示。张副政委虽在爱国自卫战争的最前线，坚持紧张而沉重的工作，但精神十分饱满，身体似乎较前更为健康，在全体亲切的目光注视下，首先谈到目前的战况，他说：“蒋介石在去年的内战中，损失了四五十个旅，这对他是个极其沉重的打击，迫使蒋介石不得不派遣国防部长陈诚来徐州视察，指挥所谓鲁南决战，企图挽回其日将崩溃的危局。但无论蒋介石如何苦心积虑，想尽办法，仍是打不了胜仗的，因为在政治上他是进行独裁卖国的内战，全国人心背离，士气不高，在军事上的兵力不足与战线太广的矛盾，始终是无法解决而且日益严重，蒋军必败是确定了的。”张副政委叙述了前方战况之后，指出目前战争的特点是带有些“拉锯式”，尽管蒋介石采取挖肉补疮法，他调若干兵力使用在主要方面，但歼灭的打击，他是仍然无法逃避的。我们的基本任务，还是继续歼灭蒋军有生力量，因此某些城市的得失，对于战局仍然还不起多大作用。如我军撤出临沂及敌人的再陷巨野，对于鲁南及鲁西战局，并不能发生多大的影响，而我们的主力，则始终主动的活动着，这点连蒋管区的人民，都是看的很清楚的。”
    接着，对于今年政治工作任务与方法问题，张副政委提出极其具体和透彻的指示，他说：“政治工作除了保证作战、练兵、生产节约、团结官兵、团结军民、瓦解敌军等任务的实现以外，别无其他什么政治工作任务，而这些任务归根到底又是为了粉碎蒋介石的进攻，争取自卫战争胜利。今天政治工作的问题不是任务问题，而是方法问题，所以改造政治工作，是说的改造那些工作的方法问题。政治工作中的主观主义、教条主义，是思想方法、工作方法上的错误。”
    “首先”，张副政委说：“根据半年自卫战争中摸索体验一条经验，从思想上解决问题，加强思想教育，这是政治工作中最主要也是最基本的方法，这是大家都知道的，毛主席的论联合政府中，早已指出过。但如何做呢？这就要多研究了。”他以前方两个不同的纵队工作举例，他说：“两个纵队同样是强调了从思想上解决问题，但一个是除一般的提出外，并具体的进行思想教育，一个却只进行一般的思想教育。结果前者有力量，而后者表现没有力量，前者发生很大的影响，而后者并不发生什么重大影响，人们的行动仍然如故。”他着重的说：“思想教育的目的，是要改造人们的思想意识与行动，使之形成一种新的意识和行动，并且成为习惯。仅仅一般的思想教育，是不能起什么很大作用的。必须要表扬一种具体行动（思想的反映），这就是我们所要提倡的方向，使人们向着正确的方向前进，则另外的不正确的方向，自然就没有地位了。如果更进一步适当的对于不正确的方向加以批判，那么人们的思想和认识会更明确起来的，会发生更大的力量。因此，思想教育不在乎是否强调，而在于是否具体进行思想教育。”
    “此外，严肃组织和纪律，也是必要的。”张副政委以执行三大纪律八项注意和部队在战场上的行动为例，说明“自觉虽然是主要的，必须还要有组织与纪律，统一大家的行动与步骤。”特别指出：“军队的组织是最严密的，对于少数落后部分，更须要有组织与纪律来约束或督促他们的行动。和平思想，不仅给我们思想上以影响，而且也给我们组织上以某些损害。因此，加强这一方面，也是重要的。”“虽然在思想上是万众一心了，但如果在组织上是乌合之众，仍然不可能战胜敌人的。”张副政委用这样沉重的字句来说明组织和纪律的重要。
    “表扬英雄模范，在前方起着显著的作用，这是工作方法，也是思想教育方法之一。这一方面，已有很多介绍，不去重复；后方工作中，一样可以普遍展开。”张副政委还指出：“当前政治工作中，必须加强党委的工作，一元化的原则在部队中虽然是恢复过去古田会议的精神，但对于大多数的同志说，是一个新问题。在这个意义上说，又是个新的建设，我们应很好的来研究，并在部队中贯彻实施。”最后，他着重指出政治工作中的一点经验说：“政治工作，不是少数政工人员的工作，而是全党全军同志的工作，因此政治机关要发动大家来做，政治机关的任务，就在于如何使政治工作除精通政治工作业务以外，同时并变成大家的工作，组织大家参加政治工作。有些同志认为政治工作是政治工作人员的，因而采取袖手旁观的态度，也有些政工人员，关起门来孤立自己，都是错误的。非常明白，我们的军事指挥员或者战士，谁的政治兴趣高有发展，他的军事工作与指挥也就顺利发展，因为一切都是建筑在自觉的政治基础上的。苏沃洛夫元帅也认为政治认识、士气是基本的，这说明政治工作在部队一切工作中的地位及其要求变成群众性的工作，是多么迫切呵！”张副政委对各部门的具体工作指示之后，关于前方和后方工作的问题，他说：“前方后方同样都是处在整个战争的紧张状态中，工作是整体的不可分开的，都是同样的重要同样的光荣的。前方打胜仗，不仅是前方部队的功绩。同时也是后方工作的功绩，前后方的工作条件虽有很大的不同，今天后方自然还须以最大努力支援前线，但前后方都能贡献自己的聪明才力。”因此，他号召：“不管前方和后方，每个同志都应当用战斗的紧张的心情，努力的完成各人自己工作岗位中的任务，在爱国自卫战中，前后方都开展立功运动。”
