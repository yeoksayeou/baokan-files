[This report from our Taihang correspondent, 20th] The Third Administrative Office of Taihang recently issued a commendation regarding the water conservancy efforts in the Third District of Pingshun, stating: Dongzhuang in the Third District of Pingshun, in order to develop the textile industry and solve the difficulties of cotton ginning and carding, organized a water conservancy committee last winter to utilize the water power of the Zhuozhang River to design a water-powered blowing bow. This committee, led by Comrade Yue Yong, and with the collective research of Zhao Meng'en and five others, planned the project and organized an earthwork construction team of more than forty people. After two months, it was fully completed by the end of the lunar year. Currently, one waterwheel-driven blowing bow, two cotton gins, and two spinning machines have been installed and are rotating very quickly. One blowing bow can produce 500 jin of finished cotton per day, exceeding manual labor by five times. During the project, it was always combined with the rent reduction work in the village, and they overcame various difficulties. For example, when the top beam was first installed, it would not rotate. Comrade Yue Yong added an iron shaft after research, and then it started to rotate. Many carpenters who had only done small household work also fully utilized their creativity. Now, they are planning to manufacture more blowing bows. The commendation pointed out: In areas and villages lacking scientific and technological knowledge, the success of the cadres and masses of Dongzhuang Village in this water conservancy project proves that the people of the liberated areas are creative. It is hoped that all regions can utilize local conditions to carry out mass-based creative undertakings. In particular, the mass cadres of Dongzhuang Village should strive for excellence and build it even more completely.

    东庄干群天才创造
    利用水力弹花纺纱
    太行三专署特通令表扬
    【本报太行二十日电】三专署顷通令表扬平顺三区兴修水利称：平顺三区东庄为开展纺织，解决弹花轧花困难，于去冬组织水利委员会，利用浊漳水力，设计水打风弓。该会由岳庸同志负责，另有赵蒙恩等六人集体研究，规划工程，组织一个四十多人的土木包工队。经两个月时间，到阳历年底全部完成。现已装置起立轮绊带风弓一架，轧花车两架，纺纱机两架，转动很快。一架风弓日出五百斤成花，超过人力五倍。在工程进行中，始终与该村查减结合，并冲破种种困难，如开始安起天梁转动不开，岳庸同志又加装铁轴，经研究后，便转动起来。许多只做过小生活的木工，也充分发挥了他们的创造性，现又计划制造风弓。通令中指出：在缺乏科学技术的区村，东庄干部群众此次兴修水利的成功，证明解放区人民是有创造性的，并望各地能利用当地条件进行群众性的创造事业，特别是东庄村的群众干部，更应精益求精，把它建设的更完备些。
