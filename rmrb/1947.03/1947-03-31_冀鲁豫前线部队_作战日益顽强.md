    [Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei] Director Zhong of the Political Department of a certain unit, recently returned from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front, spoke at length about the rapid progress of the troops at the front, and said: (1) It is reflected in the tenacity of combat: The Longbao Defense War was the best test of the tenacity of our troops. For half a month, the enemy only advanced ten miles. The entire unit proposed "The village remains as long as we are here," preparing to endure three thousand shells. After the Battle of Longji, there was a quick counterattack, launching the Jinan Campaign, capturing Xin alive, and obtaining five howitzers. Then in the Huaxian Campaign in November, the Huangzhuang stronghold had the most solid fortifications, which the enemy called "permanent fortifications," which were unbreakable, but we only fought for two hours and completely resolved the battle. The heroic and tenacious spirit of our soldiers is very admirable. (2) Reflected in mass discipline: This self-defense war had the best impact on the masses. During the Longguji Defense War, the troops helped the masses with the autumn harvest during the lulls in the fighting. When the troops were stationed in Guancheng, they were very successful in helping the masses with their work. The county magistrate personally wrote a letter asking us to issue a commendation. This time the troops were stationed in a certain place, because the people were very poor due to the ravages of war, we told the government not to launch a comfort campaign. The county and district also instructed the villages not to offer comfort to the troops. As a result, the masses voluntarily launched a campaign to comfort the troops, with several villages donating over two million in goods and money. (3) Everyone is modest: This is a characteristic jointly demonstrated by all commanders and fighters—from the commander to every soldier. Although they have won many battles, they are never proud, always feeling that they are not as good as other troops, and diligently striving to learn from other troops. (4) Tight organization improves discipline—discipline is combat effectiveness. The troops at the front have made the fastest progress in this regard. Now, the execution of orders is never bargained, but is resolutely and thoroughly completed. (5) Everyone has a responsible democratic work style, which is also following the mass line. For every work task, everyone is mobilized to discuss, think of ways, and complete it with collective wisdom and effort. For example, once when it was necessary to clarify the enemy's situation, an order was given to capture live prisoners. As a result, the masses came up with a way, and the story of Luo Baozhou cleverly capturing prisoners appeared. That is, after each battle, everyone is mobilized to review the tactics and improve step by step. (6) Taking care of the overall interests and opposing departmentalism is best implemented. All the materials seized in each battle are turned over to the public. Soldiers only know how to eliminate the enemy on the battlefield, and there is no phenomenon of violating battlefield discipline. This is the main manifestation of the progress of the troops at the front in the past six months. The progress of the troops at the front comes from all aspects. Comrades in the rear are equally meritorious.

    冀鲁豫前线部队
    作战日益顽强
    【本报冀南讯】甫自冀鲁豫前线归来之某部政治部钟主任纵谈前方部队进步之神速情况，略称：（一）表现在作战的顽强上：龙保卫战，是对于我们部队顽强性的最好的考验，半月使敌人仅前进十里，整个部队都提出“人在村在”，准备挨三千发炮弹。龙集战后，紧接着来了个回马枪，打响济南战役，活捉了信，得了五门榴弹炮，接着十一月滑县战役，黄庄据点工事最坚固，敌人称为“永久工事”，是不可攻破的，但是我们仅仅打了两小时，就全部解决战斗。我们部队战士的英勇顽强精神是很可爱的。（二）表现在群众纪律上：这次自卫战中给群众影响最好。龙崮集保卫战中，利用战争空隙帮助群众收秋。部队驻在观城时，帮助群众工作很有成绩，县长亲自写信，要我们通令嘉奖。这次部队在某地驻防，因为人民受到战争摧残很贫困，我们向政府讲不让发动慰劳。县区也向村里布置不要群众慰劳，结果群众自愿发起劳军，几个村子慰劳物品及钱达二百多万。（三）大家虚心：这是全体指战员——上自司令员，下至每个战士共同表现的一个特点，大家虽然打了许多次胜仗，从不骄傲，总觉不如别的部队，兢兢业业的努力向别的部队学习。（四）严密组织提高纪律——纪律就是战斗力。这一点前方部队进步最快，现在对于命令的执行，从不讲价钱，是坚决、彻底的完成命令。（五）大家负责的民主工作作风，也就是走群众路线，对于每一工作任务，都是发动大家讨论，想办法，群策群力的完成。如有一次要搞清敌人情况，下命令捉活俘虏，结果群众想出了办法，出现了罗保周巧计捉俘虏的故事。就是每次战役结束后，对于战术的研究，也发动大家检讨，步步提高。（六）照顾整体利益，反对本位主义，这一项执行的最好，每次战役之所缴获物资全部归公，战士们在战场上只知道消灭敌人，没有违犯战场纪律的现象。这是前方部队在近半年一来，进步的主要表现。前方部队的进步是从各方面得来的。后方的同志，也同样是有功劳的。
