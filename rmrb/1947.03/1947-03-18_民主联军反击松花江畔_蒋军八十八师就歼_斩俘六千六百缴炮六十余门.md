　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, urgent dispatch, 15th: The Northeast Democratic Allied Forces annihilated the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's 88th Division on the banks of the Songhua River on the 10th, which had advanced north from Changchun, and routed the 87th Division and the directly subordinate units of the 71st Army. Since the end of last month, when the Democratic Allied Forces annihilated the 89th Regiment of the 30th Division of the New 1st Army in Chengzijie and occupied Jiutai and Nong'an, Chiang Kai-shek's army has gathered forces and advanced north from Changchun. In order to lure the enemy deep, when the Chiang Kai-shek troops arrived at the Songhua River on the 9th of this month, the Democratic Allied Forces launched a counterattack. On the 9th, they repelled a part of the 50th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's New 1st Army in the Lianjiagou and Chaoyangbao area northwest of Dehui, destroying and capturing five tanks. On the evening of the same day, the 88th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 71st Army in the Kaoshantun area northwest of Dehui, under the attack of the Democratic Allied Forces, fled to Dehui. The Democratic Allied Forces completely annihilated one battalion of its 262nd Regiment, and five companies of its 264th Regiment were intercepted at Kaoshantun. On the evening of the same day, the main force of the 88th Division and the 87th Division reinforced Kaoshantun. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the 88th Division was completely annihilated except for a very small number that dispersed; the 87th Division and the directly subordinate units of the 71st Army were completely routed and fled back to Nong'an in a panic. According to preliminary statistics, in this battle, more than 5,100 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and officers were captured, including the regiment commander and deputy regiment commander of the 263rd Regiment and the regiment commander of the 264th Regiment (including nine battalion commanders), more than 1,500 were wounded, more than 3,500 rifles were seized, more than 100 light machine guns, more than 40 heavy machine guns, more than 60 artillery pieces of various calibers, more than 80 submachine guns, and five anti-tank guns, and all ammunition and supplies of the army were seized. Detailed battle results are being checked.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: The morale of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Yongji and other isolated strongholds is extremely low under the siege and political propaganda of the local military and civilians. Good news is secretly circulating internally: "The Democratic Allied Forces are issuing passports to return home" and "Everyone is given a lot of travel expenses." When a company of the 112th Regiment of the New 38th Division of the New 1st Army was transferred from Wula Street to Tiangang, more than 30 people deserted. A soldier of the company, Gao Fengming, arrived at a unit of the Democratic Allied Forces on the 22nd of last month. According to him: "The treatment of new and old soldiers in the Central Army is unequal. New soldiers only receive 28 yuan, which is 8 yuan less than the old soldiers. New soldiers are always mistreated." Zhang Yiqing and Pan Yixin, two soldiers of the Second Company, First Battalion, First Regiment of the 21st Temporary Division of the 60th Army, defected to the Democratic Allied Forces from the Tiangang stronghold, bringing with them a U.S.-made submachine gun stolen from the squad leader. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek's army has posted notices throughout Yongji City to "stabilize the people's hearts."

　　民主联军反击松花江畔
    蒋军八十八师就歼
    斩俘六千六百缴炮六十余门
    【新华社东北十五日急电】东北民主联军十日在松花江畔歼灭由长春北犯之蒋军八十八师主力，并击溃八十七师及七十一军直属队。民主联军自上月下旬歼灭城子街新一军三十师八十九团占领九台农安后，蒋军即集结兵力由长春向北进犯；为诱敌深入，至本月九日各路蒋军抵达松花江边时，民主联军即展开反击，九日将德惠西北之连家沟、朝阳堡一带蒋军新一军五十师一部击退，击毁并俘获坦克五辆。当日晚，德惠西北靠山屯一带蒋军七十一军八十八师在民主联军攻击下，向德惠逃窜，民主联军全歼其二六二团一个营，其二六四团五个连则被截阻于靠山屯。当日晚，八十八师主力及八十七师均向靠山屯增援。经一昼夜激战，八十八师除极小部分溃散外，全部就歼；八十七师及七十一军直属队则被全部击溃，狼狈窜回农安。据初步统计，是役共俘蒋军二六三团正副团长、二六四团团长以下官兵五千一百余人（内营长九名），击伤其一千五百余人，缴获步枪三千五百余枝，轻机枪一百余挺，重机枪四十余挺，各种口经炮六十余门，冲锋枪八十余枝，反坦克枪五枝，并缴获该军全部弹药辎重，详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社东北十五日电】永吉及其他孤立据点的蒋军，在当地军民的围困和政治宣传下，士气极为低落，内部暗传好消息：“民主联军发回家护照”，“每人发很多路费”。新一军新三十八师一一二团一营一连从乌拉街到天岗换防时，三十余人开了小差。该连士兵高凤鸣于上月二十二日抵达民主联军某部，据他说：“中央军新老兵待遇不平等，新兵只发二十八元来钱，比老兵少八元，新兵没有不受气的”。六十军暂二十一师一团一营二连士兵张义清、潘义辛两人由天岗据点摧械投奔民主联军，并偷来班长的美制冲锋机枪一枝。现永吉市内蒋军遍贴“安定民心”的布告。
