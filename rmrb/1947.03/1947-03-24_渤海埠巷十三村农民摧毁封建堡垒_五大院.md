Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st—Farmers in thirteen villages in the Bohaibu Alley District of Shanghe County, Bohai, jointly demolished the feudal fortress of the "Five Great Courtyards" and recovered a century of blood debts. The Wang family's "Five Great Courtyards" in Wangzhai Village were major evil despots who had ruled the Bohaibu Alley District for over a century. They owned more than 4,000 mu of land, 500 buildings, 400 livestock, more than 30 sedans, employed more than 100 long-term laborers, more than 400 short-term laborers, 40 to 50 maids and women, and had more than 60 armed guards. During the great famine in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, the landlord Wang Tonglong opened the Yisheng Pawnshop and swindled a large amount of property from farmers at a small price. Later, he took out the valuables and set fire to the pawnshop. Thousands upon thousands of poor pawnshop customers cried to the heavens and the earth, but the Wang family celebrated the success of this brilliant strategy for getting rich, adding more than 2,000 mu of land in one go (in addition to more than 2,500 mu of estate land in other counties, the Five Great Courtyards had 1,500 mu of land in the village). More than 400 tenant households in the surrounding thirteen villages rented less than one mu of land per person on average, paying 40% of their harvest as rent and suffering all kinds of exploitation and enslavement. The Wang family produced high officials from generation to generation. "Wen Kui Di" and "Governor's Office" were the historical titles of the Wang family. The landlord Wang Jingbai served as the director of the Zizhou Sino-Japanese Joint Mining Office during the enemy and puppet period. In order to "transform the feng shui," the Wang family built a "Kui Xing Tower" in the northwest corner, built large ponds around the village, built spiritual stopover buildings by the ponds, and built ten high buildings in the courtyard, using more than 100,000 man-days of unpaid labor. The "Five Great Courtyards" had more than 40 large opium pipes. Children were addicted to opium from birth and would cry incessantly if they were not given a few puffs every day. The Wang family once drove young female tenants to pick cotton for them, falsely accusing them of stealing flowers, forcing several women to undress and be searched, and finally rascally saying, "I am checking if your skin is white or not." None of the victimized farmers did not hate the Wang family, but they dared not speak out. Last spring, rent and interest reduction campaigns were carried out everywhere, but the Wang family was very resourceful, turning rented land into mortgaged land and using their henchmen to serve as village cadres to continue to rule the farmers. After the land-to-the-tiller movement was launched last June, thousands upon thousands of men and women farmers unanimously rose up to settle blood debts with the "Five Great Courtyards." Except for the estate land in other counties, 870 mu of land returned to the hands of the farmers. The "Kui Xing Tower" and "Stopover Buildings," built with the blood and sweat of the farmers, were demolished in the anger of the farmers; they used the existing materials to build their own brand-new houses. More than 400 tenant farmers in thirteen villages were divided into land and became self-cultivating farmers, and more than 500 middle peasants shared the fruits. Sixty poor tenant farmers in Wangzhai Village rose to become middle peasants. The Wang family's "Five Great Courtyards" had a total of 150 people. In order to take care of their lives, the government and the masses left them 360 mu of land and 100 buildings.

    渤海埠巷十三村农民摧毁封建堡垒“五大院”
    【新华社山东二十一日电】渤海商河县埠巷区十三个村农民，合力摧毁封建堡垒“五大院”，讨还百年血债。王寨村王家“五大院”，是统治埠巷区百年多的大恶霸，拥有土地四千余亩，楼房五百间，牲口四百头，轿车卅余辆，使用长工百余、短工四百余、丫环妇女四、五十，并有护院武装六十余。清末民初大歉年，地主王同龙开亿盛当，以微少代价骗到农民大量财物。后将值钱的检出纵火将当铺烧光，成千成万贫苦当户哭天号地，王家却欢庆这一发家妙策的成功，一气添置土地二千余亩（五大院除外县有庄田二千五百余亩外，本村有地一千五百亩），周围十三个村四百余家佃户，平均每人租种不到一亩地，四六交租，差拨工受尽剥削奴役。王家代代出大官“文魁第”“都督府”是王家的历史称号，地主王静白，敌伪时期曾任淄州中日合办矿业所所长。为了“改造风水”，王家更修西北角建起“奎星楼”，环村修立大水塘，塘边修上停灵楼，院中筑高楼十座，无代价动工达十余万。“五大院”共有四十余支大烟枪，小孩生下来就染上烟瘾，每天不给他喷上几口就哭叫不停。王家曾驱迫佃户青年妇女替他摘棉花，反诬她们偷了花，强迫几个妇女解开衣服任其搜摸，最后无赖地说：“我是看看你们的皮白不白。”受害农民没有一个不痛恨王家，但是敢怒不敢言。去年春天到处进行减租减息，王家神通广大，把租地变成佃当地，利用狗腿子出任村干部，继续统治农民。去年六月土地还家运动开展后，成千上万的男女农民，一致起来向“五大院”清算血债，除外县庄田外，八百七十亩地回到了农民手里，用农民血汗筑成的“奎星楼”“停灵楼”，在农民愤怒下加以拆毁；利用现成材料建起自己崭新的房屋，十三个村四百多户佃农，分得土地变成自耕农，五百余户中农分得果实。王寨村六十户贫佃农上升为中农，王家“五大院”共有一百五十口人，政府与群众为照顾其生活，尚留给地三百六十亩，楼房一百间。
