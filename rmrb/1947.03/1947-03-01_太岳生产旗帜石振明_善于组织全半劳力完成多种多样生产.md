(From our Taiyue correspondent, 27th) The Shi Zhenming Mutual Aid Team has become a banner for the people of the Taiyue region in carrying out production. This joint mutual aid team includes five administrative villages—Fan Village, Tuling, Chuankou, and Guanyin Temple in Yuantou—totaling 391 natural villages with 2,489 members and 738 livestock. All able-bodied men, women, young and old, are organized, ensuring that no one within a radius of forty li does not participate in mutual aid labor. Cowherds and shepherd boys who used to not go out early are now organized by Shi Zhenming to participate in mutual aid groups, each earning two work points every morning. After breakfast, if there are four cowherds, they are divided into two groups, with two herding the cattle and two continuing to participate in labor. Those herding the cattle eat the cattle owner’s food, while those participating in mutual aid eat the food of whoever they are working for, satisfying both the owner and the worker. The cattle owner saves two meals, and the worker also earns two work points. Herding cattle can incidentally involve collecting firewood and manure, with every 120 jin of firewood or manure collected equivalent to ten work points for the individual, saving the mutual aid team from having to allocate specific people for firewood collection. Carpenters provide carpentry work for the mutual aid team, and the mutual aid team cultivates land for them. Merchants also participate in the mutual aid team, but all profits from their market trading belong to them. Idlers who lack the habit of labor are organized together, starting with light work and gradually transitioning to heavy work, with working hours also slowly increasing. Landlords who face hardship after being liquidated are encouraged to participate in mutual aid, with grain and tools lent to them to boost their enthusiasm for production. Even the disabled and lame are organized; if they cannot do heavy work, they exchange labor with children, with children carrying loads for them while they weed seedlings for the children. Old women look after the young women's children, and young women cultivate land for the old women. In short, anyone can participate in mutual aid, and agriculture, industry, and commerce can all engage in labor exchange. Work points are recorded based on labor, skills, and achievements, with equal value exchange. Top labor earns ten work points per day, medium labor earns seven to eight work points per day, semi-labor earns five to six work points per day, and lower labor earns four to five work points per day. If women weeding seedlings or old men plowing, sowing, or threshing are not weaker than top labor, they are rated according to their effectiveness, with a reward system in place. For example, if someone exceeds the general level, they can earn eleven to twelve work points. In addition, animal power is also used for labor exchange, with a person and an ox plowing one mu of fine soil equivalent to one work point, plowing three mu in two days equivalent to three work points, plowing one and a half mu of hard autumn crop land equivalent to two mu, sowing six mu equivalent to one work point, and harrowing four mu equivalent to one work point. Due to the complexity of labor exchange and the difficulty of recording work points, a work ticket system has been created, with points assigned per task and work tickets issued. The work tickets are managed by the group leader of each team, with each person initially receiving 300 points. If they feel they need more, they can freely request more from the group leader, and if there are changes in wages, the work tickets are collected and reissued. For example, when weeding seedlings, each work point is worth three sheng of rice, and when harvesting wheat, each work point is worth five sheng of rice, at which point the work tickets are collected and settled. If the work tickets at the time of weeding seedlings are more than the original amount received, it is considered saved work; otherwise, it is considered owed work. Those who have saved enough to replenish their original amount receive wages, while those who owe work but cannot pay it back at the moment are provided a loan by the cooperative.

    善于组织全半劳力完成多种多样生产
    【本报太岳二十七日电】石振明联合互助大队已成为太岳区人民进行生产的旗帜。该联合互助大队包括范村、土岭、川口、原头的观音庙等五个行政村共三百九十一个自然村，队员达二千四百八十九人，牲口七百三十八头所有男女青壮老劳力都组织起来了，使周围四十余里的村庄，没有一个人不参加互助劳动。放牛工及牧童清早不出门，石振明便将他们组织起来，参加互助组，每人每早记工二分。早饭后如有四个牛工，便分为两组，两人放牛，两人依旧参加劳动。放牛的吃牛主的饭，参加互助的给谁劳动吃谁的饭，使主雇两方都满意，牛主省两顿饭，雇工也得二分工。放牛可捎带拾柴拾粪，每拾一百二十斤柴或粪即顶十分工归自己，亦省得互助组内专门拨人打柴。木匠给互助组作木工，互助组给他种地。商人也参加互助组，但逢集市做买卖得利，全归自己。二流子没有劳动的习惯，将他们组织在一起，开始作轻活，逐渐转为重活，劳动时间亦是慢慢由少增多。被清算后的地主，生活困难，便动员他们参加互助，借给其粮食与用具提高其生产情绪。残废跛子也被组织起来，不能做重活则与儿童变工，儿童给他担挑，他给儿童拔苗。老婆给青年妇女看孩，青年妇女给老婆种地。总之任何人皆能互助，农工商皆能变工。记工是按劳力、技术、成绩为标准，等价交换。上劳力一工十分，中劳力一工七分至八分，半劳力一工五分至六分，下劳力一工四分至五分。妇女拔苗、老汉半劳力耕地、下种、碾场，并不弱于上劳力便按效果评分，并且还有奖励制度，如有人超过一般水平，便顶十一分至十二分。此外畜力也变工，连牛带人细犁一亩顶一工，两天犁三亩地顶三工，秋庄稼地硬犁一亩五分顶二亩，麦地二亩顶一工，下种六亩顶一工，耙地四亩顶一工。由于变工复杂，记工困难，创造了工票制度，按件订分，发给工票。工票由每组组长负责，一般每人先发三百分，如自己感到不足，可自由向组长增减，工资若有变动，即收回工票重新发出。如锄苗时每工三升米，割麦时每工五升米，此时便将工票收回清算。锄苗时的工票比原来领数多了，便是存工，反之便是欠工。补足原领数存工者得工资，如欠工者一时交不出由合作社垫给作为借贷。
