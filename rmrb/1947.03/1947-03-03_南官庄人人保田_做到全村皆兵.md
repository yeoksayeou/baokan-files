　　South Guanzhuang: Everyone Protects the Fields, Achieving Total Mobilization

　　[Report from Taiyue by this newspaper on the 1st] South Guanzhuang, a border village in the Second District of Jiyuan, after completing land reform amidst the gunfire, proposed achieving "total mobilization" in order to launch a movement to protect homes and fields. During the land reform in this village, the local tyrant and bully Shang Fudong and others colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek troops from Longtai six times, invading and sabotaging the land reform. However, they were repelled by the village militia each time, so the masses recognized the importance of armed protection of the fields. Later, the tyrant Shang Fudong threatened to "mobilize a large army to wipe out South Guanzhuang." Subsequently, in April, he led over a thousand enemies from Longtai, Yusi and other places, carrying six heavy machine guns and four mortars, to invade South Guanzhuang, and sent more than fifty counter-reckoning team members as the vanguard. Upon reaching Pei Village (separated from South Guanzhuang by the Mang River), they were immediately ambushed by militia snipers, with four killed or wounded, abandoning the corpses and fleeing. The South Guanzhuang militia took advantage of the situation to pursue across the Mang River, using dense machine gun fire, causing the enemy to retreat in panic. On the 6th, more than three hundred enemies invaded again but were still blocked outside Pei Village. The enemy launched four offensives against the high ground of Pei Village, but were repelled by the militia guarding Houyuan Stockade, and one enemy soldier was killed. After two hours of fighting, the enemy ultimately failed and retreated in frustration. After two battles, the emancipated peasants in the village were filled with victorious confidence, and they mobilized their sons, brothers, and husbands to join the home and field protection militia. Now, all the people in the village are swept up in a wave of martial arts training, and they have established joint village defense with Nanrong, Zaiwei, and other villages to jointly protect the fields.

　　南官庄人人保田
    做到全村皆兵
    【本报太岳一日电】济源二区边地南官庄，在炮火中完成土地改革后，为了展开保家保田运动，提出做到“全村皆兵”。该村在进行土地改革期间，奸霸头子尚福东等，曾六次勾结龙台蒋军进犯破坏土地改革。但被该村民兵一一击退，因此群众认识了武装保田的重要。以后奸霸尚福东扬言“调动大军扫光南官庄”。遂于四月率领龙台、禹寺等敌千余人，携重机枪六挺，迫击炮四门向南官庄进犯，并派出倒算队五十余人为先头部队。进至裴村（与南官庄隔一蟒河）即被民兵冷枪阻击，毙伤四名，弃尸而逃。南官庄民兵趁势追过蟒河，以密集机枪射击，打得敌慌忙撤退。六日敌三百余人再度进犯，仍被阻击于裴村村外。该敌曾四次向裴村之高地冲锋，均被据守候园寨民兵击退，并击毙敌一人，战斗二小时后，敌终不得逞泄气而回。该村经过两次战斗后，翻身农民充满胜利信心，纷纷动员儿子兄弟丈夫参加保家保田民兵队。现全村人民均卷入练武热潮，并与南荣、载维等村，建立联村联防，联合保田。
