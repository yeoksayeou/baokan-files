Xia County, Taiyue, 21st (From Our Correspondent) To coordinate with the military offensive of the guerrillas, a certain district in Xia County has universally convened "Find a Way Out" meetings for families of 顽军 soldiers. These meetings have been held sixteen times and have played a significant role in winning over the 顽军 soldiers coerced by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. At the "Find a Way Out" meetings, families were first encouraged to express their grievances based on their different actual sufferings. In a certain village, a detailed investigation was conducted beforehand regarding which family member of a 顽军 soldier "loved their son the most" and "who lacked labor the most." During the 顽军 family meeting, one young woman's husband was seized and taken away, leaving only her seventy-year-old mother and one-and-a-half-year-old child at home, and the fields were completely barren. She said, "Following the wolves (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan forces) is a dead end." The young woman cried sadly, "It's all Chiang Kai-shek's fault!" The seventy-year-old Cui Lao Han loved his son the most. At the meeting, he was guided and inspired: "You still let the 顽军 grab him to be a soldier even though you only had one son. You failed your ancestors above and your children and grandchildren below. Everyone is planting trees to guard against old age, but you have ended up with nothing." The old man bitterly complained, "The damned Chiang Kai-shek, he wants to kill me. I must call my child back!" At this time, the lenient policy of the democratic government was immediately explained, stating that as long as they returned and repented, the government would not hold them accountable and would guarantee their safety, in order to dispel their worries. After this "Find a Way Out" meeting, most of the 顽军 families discussed "Being a 顽军 soldier has no good end," "The child calls for the father," "The father calls for the child," and "The wife calls for the husband," creating a heated movement. In half a month, more than ten 顽军 soldiers from Xia County's "Love the Hometown Corps" alone were called back.

    夏县某区召集顽军家属
    启发诉苦找出路
    【本报太岳二十一日电】夏县某区配合游击队的军事进攻，普遍召开顽军家属的“找出路”会议。先后进行十六次，对争取被蒋阎胁迫的顽军士兵起了很大作用。在“找出路”会上，首先根据各个顽军家属不同的实际痛苦，发动他们诉苦。某村对顽属中“谁最爱儿子”、“谁最缺劳力”，都在事先作了详细调查。开顽属会时，有一少妇的男人被抓去后，家中只剩下七十多岁的老母和一岁半的小孩，田地完全荒了，她说：“跟上狼（指蒋阎军）咬人，只有死路一条。”少妇伤心的哭着说：“都是蒋介石害了我。”七十多岁的崔老汉最爱儿子，在会上即诱导启发他：“一手捉谷（指独子），还叫顽军抓走当了兵，上对不起祖先，下对不起儿孙，大家都是栽树防老，你自己落得没下场。”老汉气恨恨的诉起苦来：“狗日的蒋介石，他是要杀我了，我非把孩子叫回来不行。”此时即当场说明民主政府的宽大政策，只要回来悔过自新，政府不究既往，保证无事，以打破他们的顾虑。经过这次“找出路”会后，多数顽属纷纷议论“当顽军没好下场”、“娃叫爷”、“爷叫娃”、“妻叫夫”，一时形成热烈运动。半月来仅夏县“爱乡团”的顽军士兵即被叫回十余人。
