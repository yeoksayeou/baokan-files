　　Hukou Masses Inspire Each Other to Raise Awareness
    Recognize the Landlord's Beastly Nature
    Resolutely Separate from Landlords Ideologically, Refusing to Be "Air Raid Shelters"
    [Our newspaper, Changzhi News] Hukou town held an ideological review conference during the in-depth movement. Wang Genbao, chairman of the Farmers' Association, first reviewed his own thinking, saying: "In the past, I borrowed six sheng of soybeans from the landlord Song Tuzi. Because he was a neighbor, and seeing that everyone was fighting against big things, I felt embarrassed to bring up this small matter." Yang Erpang's wife said: "We borrowed a cast iron pot lid from the landlord An He. We were not active in the struggle because we thought it would be bad to fight against someone after borrowing something from them." Cui Shuangzi's wife said: "My mother-in-law felt sorry for her daughter, who talked about relatives covering up six or seven items belonging to the landlord Niu Haishui!" After everyone reviewed their thoughts one by one, political director Li Sanzi asked, "How have the landlords treated us?" "Should we talk about sentiment and conscience with the landlords?" The masses then launched a heated discussion. Wang Sanzi jumped up and said, "The landlord lost his conscience long ago! I was burning bricks for Song Jiuhai. If six layers collapsed out of ten layers of bricks, he wouldn't pay me. Eight or nine times out of ten, it was the sixth layer that collapsed, and we often worked for nothing. Do you think the landlord's exploitation is ruthless or not? Song Jiuhai's two brick courtyards are made with the blood and sweat of people like us. What conscience does he have?" Middle peasant Wang Dongsheng continued, "The landlord Wang Yushan is from the same family as us. He was the village chief before. When my family couldn't pay the grain, he detained my mother in the temple. He doesn't care about your feelings!" The old man Wang Manjing chimed in, "Listen to me. I worked for the wealthy Pei Wuqu of Bei Shicao. I went back for lunch earlier than he liked, and he would use a rattan whip to drive me out, not letting me eat. In the city, day labor earned over 130 coins, but he only gave me 90 coins. Where do you say the landlord's conscience is?" The masses immediately shouted in unison, "The landlord has lost his conscience!" "Landlords are capable of doing things that defy conscience!" Then they started to yell, one after another. "I've been chased with a whip too. All wealthy people are equally bad!" "Right, right! All wealthy people are equally bad! In the past, when we asked a wealthy person for a clod of earth, not only would they not give it, but they would also let their dogs bite us. The landlords separated from us poor people long ago, and they lost their sentiment and conscience long ago!" "In famine years, landlords only knew how to seek advantages and didn't care about the life and death of others. Their conscience was eaten by dogs and replaced with a wolf's heart to specifically devour poor people!" At this point, political director Li Sanzi made a conclusion, calling on everyone to separate from landlords ideologically, go back and hold family meetings to continue reviewing their thoughts, and thoroughly ensure that not a single grain of rice or a single small item belonging to the landlords is concealed.

　　壶口群众互相启发提高觉悟
    认清地主人面狼心
    坚决从思想上和地主分家不做“防空洞”
    【本报长治讯】壶口镇在深入运动中举行思想检查大会。农会主席王根保首先检讨自己的思想说：“过去借地主宋秃子六升豆子，因为是邻居，见人家的大东西都斗了，这点小东西总不好意思拿出来。”杨二胖妻说：“咱借地主安和铁锅盖用，斗争时不积极，心想借人家东西还斗争人家，怕坏良心。”崔双子妻说：“我婆婆心痛她的闺女，讲亲戚包庇地主牛海水六、七件东西！”经过大家一个个检讨后，政治主任李三子提出“地主对咱们怎样？”“是不是跟地主讲情面？讲良心？”群众随即展开热烈讨论。王三子跳起来说：“地主早把良心坏啦！我给宋九孩烧砖，垒十层坯子，坍六层就不给钱，坯子一坍十有八九是六层，俺往往白干一场，你看地主剥削狠不狠？宋九孩两座砖院还不是我们这些人的血汗，他有啥良心呀？”中农王东升接着说：“地主王玉山跟咱是本家，从前人家当村长，俺家缴不上粮，就把俺娘扣到庙里，人家不管你情面不情面！”老头子王满景抢着说：“听我说，我给北石槽老财裴五曲打忙工，前晌吃饭时候回去，人家嫌早，常用藤条鞭子把咱赶出来，叫咱吃不上饭。城里忙工一百三十多个钱，他只出九十个钱，你们说地主的良心在那里？”群众立即一齐高呼：“是地主把良心坏了！”“坏良心的事地主都能办！”接着你一言我一语地嚷起来。“我也让人家用鞭子赶过，天下老财一样坏！”“对对！天下老财一样坏！从前咱跟老财要一个圪塔，不给还罢，又让狗咬，地主早与咱穷人分家了，良心情面早没有了！”“灾荒年地主只知讨便宜，不管别人死活，良心早叫狗吃了，换成狼心专吃穷人！”至此，政治主任李三子做结论。号召大家从思想上与地主分家，回去召开家庭会继续检查思想，彻底做到不包藏地主一粒米，一点小东西。（其光）
