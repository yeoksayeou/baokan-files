　　Precise Calculation Saves Civilian Labor
    Logistics Experience of the Taiyue First Military Sub-district
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 8th dispatch] County heads and production section chiefs of the Anze, Tunliu, Changzi, and Erqin (Qinyuan, Qin County) five counties of the Taiyue First Military Sub-district, discussed on the 17th of last month the experience of saving civilian labor, developing production, and supporting the self-defense war: Logistics work must have precise calculations. Commissioner Guo gave an example: Once, a certain unit wanted to purchase 600,000 catties of grass on their behalf. At the time, we felt that if all of it was purchased by Qinyuan, Qinyuan's grass would be eaten up. So, we assigned 70,000 catties to Changzi and 80,000 catties to Qin County. But transporting from Changzi and Qin County to the army's station was over 200 li. One cart could only carry 200-300 catties. Including the cost of people, livestock, and lodging, the transportation cost would be much higher than the price of the grass. Then, we specifically calculated the land and livestock of Qinyuan once and realized that producing 600,000 catties of grass was not a problem. Therefore, we changed the original plan, which saved the civilian and animal power of several hundred carts. County Head Wu Zhigang of Tunliu County talked about the county's experience in saving civilian labor: "Once, the army needed 800 donkeys to carry grain. One donkey can only carry 80 catties, and it needs a person to follow. It also walks slowly. At that time, the masses were busy plowing. So, we flexibly used two people to replace one animal. Two people carrying 60 catties each is 120 catties, and they walk faster. Saving the donkeys allows them to plow the fields at home. One donkey is much better than one person at plowing. This not only allows for more and faster transport but also saves civilian labor." After such research, everyone felt that a slight deviation leads to a great error, and precise calculation is indeed an important issue in saving civilian labor. (Sai Zhou)

　　精确计算节省民力
    太岳一分区后勤经验
    【本报太岳八日电】太岳一分区安（泽）屯（留）长（子）及二沁（沁源沁县）五县的县长生产科长等在上月十七日讨论：节省民力开展生产支持自卫战争中，得出一个经验：后勤工作必须有精确计算。郭专员举例说：有一次某部要代买六十万斤草，当时我们觉得如全部由沁源代购就会把沁源的草吃光了，于是派给长子七万斤、沁县八万斤。但从长子、沁县运到军队驻地二百多里，一辆车只能装二、三百斤，连人、牲口、铺费算起来，脚价要比草价大的多。又具体的将沁源的土地、牲畜计算了一次，知道出六十万斤草还是无问题，所以改变了原计划，即节省了几百辆车的民力与畜力。屯留县长吴至岗谈到该县节省民力的经验时说：“有一次军队要八百头毛驴驮粮，一头毛驴只能驮八十斤，还得跟一个人，走的又慢。当时群众忙于犁地，我们就灵活的改用两个人力代替一个畜力。两个人每人担六十斤就是一百二十斤，走的又快，将驴节省下来，就可以在家犁地，一头驴比一个人犁地强的多，这既能多运快运，又省了民力。”经这样研究后，大家觉得差之毫厘失之千里，精确计算实为节省民力的重要问题。（赛周）
