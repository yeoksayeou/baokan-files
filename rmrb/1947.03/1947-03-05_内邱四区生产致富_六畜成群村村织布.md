　　Neiqiu Fourth District Prospers Through Production
    Livestock Flourishes, Villages Weave Cloth
    [This Newspaper Neiqiu News] The Fourth District, formerly known as "half a year of bran and vegetables," has seen its peasants transformed and liberated after the land reform. They are now fully engaged in production and construction, and the lives of the masses have become much more prosperous than before. The district has fifty villages with a population of over ten thousand. It now possesses over 11,000 sheep, 2,286 pigs, over 2,000 head of livestock, and 421 beehives. The district has also established six cotton ginning workshops, twelve carpentry shops, as well as blacksmith shops, oil presses, dye houses, vegetable shops, etc. Every village has established a cooperative. Among the 4,748 women in the district, 1,823 have learned to spin, and 432 have learned to weave. There are currently 2,248 spinning wheels and 243 looms. To achieve "three parts farming, one part surplus," the slogan "Every household should spin cotton, every village should weave cloth" has been put forward this year. Last winter, the district, village, and cooperative opened weaving training classes to train 500 weavers. This spring, it was decided to train another 500 people. All women aged 15 to 50 are required to learn to spin cotton. To solve the problem of tools, the district, village, and cooperative have organized twelve carpentry shops to produce spinning wheels and looms. The district has also decided to plant 1,500 mu of cotton to solve the raw material shortage. Wang Shunde, a farmer from Gangdi, said: "We have climbed out of the pit of poverty! Our village has more than 500 sheep, 13 looms, and more than 20 weavers this year. With production, we won't have to worry about food and clothing."
