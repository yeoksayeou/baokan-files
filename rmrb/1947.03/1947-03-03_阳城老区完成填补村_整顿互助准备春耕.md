Taiyue, March 28th (From Our Newspaper) The Yangcheng Old Liberated Area has completed village filling, is actively rectifying mutual aid, and preparing for spring plowing. Jiangli Village reviewed the shortcomings in last year's mutual aid: some mutual aid team leaders were landlords, not enthusiastic about leading production, sometimes disbanding and sometimes joining, inaccurate evaluations, and unfair work recording; cadres and militia organized mutual aid teams separately, and when work was busy or they left for rotation combat, production stopped; some teams separated full and semi-labor forces; some teams had many livestock while others had few, etc. After the review, all 38 mutual aid teams were dispersed and voluntarily reorganized. In the organization, attention was paid to overcoming the above problems. For example, the Lequan Water team had many elderly people with high production skills, so they were combined with a child. The Yang Changle team had many capable young men, so they were combined with a clumsy man. In addition, each team also absorbed landlords who had been liquidated to participate in labor and helped them solve difficulties. Livestock were also evenly distributed so that each team had livestock. The whole village organized 43 teams, including 431 full and semi-labor forces, and has now begun delivering manure.

Taihang, March 1st (From Our Newspaper) Longhu Village in She County, after the land reform movement, has seen all 51 impoverished peasant households rise to become middle peasants. However, due to insufficient ideological education during the movement, all classes have ideological concerns and dare not boldly prosper. For example, middle peasant Li Jinliang, who never used to get up early, now gets up only when it's time to eat, feeling that enough to eat and wear is enough. Impoverished peasant Wang Mingtang often said after the land reform, "Anyway, what can we do? If we have it, we eat it, if we don't, we don't," so he ate and drank extravagantly. Landlord Wang Chengbang was left with a few acres of land after the mass movement, but he had no intention of producing, thinking that no matter how much he earns, it's someone else's. Based on the above ideas, the village used the literacy class this month to solve ideological problems through informal discussions. Using the fact that Wang Tingsheng, a newly wealthy peasant in the village, became prosperous through labor and was not liquidated, it was explained that the struggle is not against whoever is rich, but against feudal exploitation. For the formerly impoverished, it was proposed to rather save at the mouth of the granary than at the bottom, and to establish long-term planning and the idea of managing a family. For the landlords, it was explained that the government will still guarantee what you earn through labor in the future. After this effort, the masses' thinking gradually cleared up, and they all actively demanded production and prosperity. Li Jinliang and Wang Mingtang both requested to join the mutual aid team, and landlord Wang Chengbang also prepared capital to do small business.

　　阳城老区完成填补村
    整顿互助准备春耕
    【本报太岳二十八日电】阳城老区完成填补村，正积极整顿互助准备春耕。匠礼村检讨去年互助中的缺点：有些互助组长是地主，领导生产不起劲，时散时合，评价不准，记工不公；干部与民兵各单独组织互助组，工作忙或轮战出发，生产便停顿，有些组全半劳力分开组织；有的组内牲口多有的组内牲口少等问题，检讨后三十八个互助组全部分散重新自愿结合。组织中注意克服以上毛病，如乐全水组老年人多，生产技术高明，便结合一个小孩。杨长乐组精干的小伙子多，结合一个笨汉。此外，各组又吸收被清算的地主参加劳动，并帮助其解决困难。牲口亦均匀搭配，使各组都有牲口，全村组织起四十三组，包括全半劳力四百三十一人，现已开始送粪。
    【本报太行一日电】涉县龙虎村，经过填补翻身运动，现全村五十一户赤贫农均上升中农。但由于运动中思想教育不够，各阶层在思想上都存在着顾虑，不敢大胆的发家。如中农李金良过去从来没有清早不起，现在是睡到吃饭时才起来，觉得够吃够穿就算啦。赤贫王明堂翻了身常说：“反正咱还能弄成啥，有了就好吃，没了就不吃”，因此大吃大喝。地主王成邦群运后，给他留下几亩地，亦无心生产，认为受多少也是人家的。根据以上思想，该村于本月就利用民校漫谈解决思想问题。用本村新富农王廷盛劳动起家未被清算的事实，说明斗争不是谁富就斗谁，是反对封建剥削。对过去赤贫，提出宁在囤口省不在囤底省，树立长期打算，成人家过时光的思想。对地主则解释今后劳动得来的东西，政府还要保障你。经此努力群众思想逐渐打通，均积极要求生产发家。李金良、王明堂均要求参加互助组，地主王成邦也筹备资本做小生意。
