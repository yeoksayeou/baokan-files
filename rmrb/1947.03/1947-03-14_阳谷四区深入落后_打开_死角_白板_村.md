　　[This dispatch from our newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 11th] After the Farmers' Congress in the Fourth District of Yanggu, a land-to-the-tiller movement was launched in all villages. The "backward," "dead corner," and "blank slate" villages also broke through the situation. Shen Village was a famous "backward village." After the Farmers' Congress ended, it jointly struggled against eight traitorous and tyrannical landlords. More than 1,800 members of the Yu Small District transported the landlords' ill-gotten wealth, returning with more than thirty cartloads of fruit; influenced by the joint struggle in Shen Village, West Xin Village in Kangping Small District also carried out a struggle the next day, and also helped the Xin Village Farmers' Association to struggle against the traitor leader Liu Guangxing.

　　North Jiao Village, a "dead corner" that had not been opened up for five years, was also opened up after this Farmers' Congress. The reason why it had not been opened up in the past was that the district cadres were surrounded by village cadres controlled by landlords. After this Farmers' Congress ended, the village cadres still pretended to convene a congress in form. When struggling against the local tyrant Liu Baoyu, they secretly did not allow the masses to speak, only putting forward unimportant opinions themselves. However, after this Farmers' Congress, the masses turned around and secretly said to the district cadres, "If I raise an opinion, will you support me?" The district cadres replied to them, "Do it resolutely." Liu Yuliang then angrily complained: "Liu Baoyu deserves to die, you raped my wife!" Then many people complained, and when Liu Baoyu was arrested, the masses' emotions were greatly heightened, and the tyrannical rulers were overthrown.

　　阳谷四区深入落后
    打开“死角”“白板”村
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】阳谷四区农民大会后，各村都掀起土地还家运动。“落后”“死角”“白板”村也轰开了局面。沈庄是有名的“落后村”，在此次农民大会结束后，联合斗争了八个奸霸地主，余小区一千八百余会员搬运地主浮财，满载三十余辆大车的果实而归；康平小区西辛庄在沈庄联合斗争影响下，于第二天亦进行了斗争，又帮助辛庄农会斗争汉奸头子刘光兴。五年来未打开的“死角”北焦村，在这次农民大会后，也打开了。过去没有打开的原因，是区干部被地主所掌握的村干包围。这次农民大会结束后，村干仍装做在形式上召开大会，斗争恶霸刘宝玉时，却暗地里不准群众发言，仅由自己提出不重要的意见。但群众经这次农民大会后，大家却转回头偷偷对区干部说：“俺提了意见，您给俺撑腰吗？”区干答复他们：“坚决的干吧。”刘玉凉就愤怒的诉说：“刘宝玉该死，你强奸我的老婆！”接着很多人诉苦，当将刘宝玉押起来，群众情绪大为高涨，恶霸统治者被打倒了。
