(This article originates from Taihang, dated 7th of the month) The "Meritorious Service Campaign" in our district has penetrated the economic sector. Recently, the Industrial and Commercial Second Branch convened a meeting of county bureau chiefs, putting forward the slogan "Learn from Liu Jiuqing in Performing Meritorious Service for the People." Comrade Liu has achieved remarkable results in implementing the district party committee's instruction on "organizing mass small-scale import and export." Comrade Liu is the director of the ×× Office, which is only thirty-odd miles away from the Yan stubborn strongholds. The area is at the forefront and has been made into a no-man's land by the Yan puppet regime, resulting in a large number of refugees fleeing to the interior. Liu arrived at his post last November. The import and export in the area was chaotic, smuggling was rampant, and unscrupulous merchants took advantage of the refugees' production to speculate. The enemy was also blockading us, and the border "import and export" work was at a standstill. After understanding the situation, Comrade Jiuqing personally established relationships with district and village cadres and refugees, as well as merchants in the stubborn and enemy-occupied areas. He decided to use × as a trading place and organized export groups. When deciding to export, each group would select one person to go to the office to complete the procedures, and another person to scout enemy positions and contact merchants in the enemy-occupied areas to negotiate transactions. Merchants in the enemy-occupied areas found it convenient, and the border people also felt that "being organized saves time and is safer." In December alone, they exchanged for ××× catties of edible salt. In order to solve the people's necessities in a timely manner, a small number of transit agencies were established at non-fixed addresses, specializing in absorbing goods from Hong Kong, with incidental exports, so that merchants in the enemy-occupied areas would actively come to trade, eliminating their worries that their goods would not find customers. Comrade Jiuqing felt that simply punishing smugglers would not solve the problem. He started by helping everyone find legitimate ways to make money, helping the masses calculate: what can be imported and exported? What is profitable? Then, for those who repeatedly refused to change after repeated education, he adopted the method of mass discussion and consolidated handling, and smuggling was greatly reduced. He organized the refugees, using their relatives in the enemy-occupied areas to export our mountain groceries and exchange them for necessities such as edible salt. One refugee family of three, with one donkey, made this their production, earning a net profit of 15 piculs of millet in two months, and other refugee families earned at least three piculs. Comrade Jiuqing worked hard and lived frugally. Last early winter, when he returned from the ×× border area, he was not wearing socks. After only one day of rest, he went to the front again. His leadership style is democratic, and he is very approachable to the masses. When people first meet him, they think he is an ordinary peasant. His spirit of not avoiding hardships and his in-depth mass style have enabled our border economic struggle to achieve great results.

　　太行工商二分局
    号召学习柳久青
    组织点滴输出入为民立功
    【本报太行七日电】本区“立功运动”已深入到经济部门。日前工商二分局召开县局长会议，提出“为民立功学习柳久青”的口号。柳同志在执行区党委“组织群众性的点滴输出入”指示上，成绩卓著。柳为距阎顽据点××仅三十余里之××事务所主任，该地前沿，为阎伪制造之一片无人区，难胞逃来内地极多。柳于去年十一月到岗位，当地出入口混乱，走私严重，奸商借口难民生产投机取巧；敌人又在对我封锁，边地“输出入”工作陷于停顿状态。久青同志了解情况后，便亲自与区村干部及逃难群众，深入顽区与敌占区商人建立关系，并决定×地为交易场所，组织起输出小组，决定出口时，各组选一人到事务所办手续，再选一人侦察敌情和敌占区商人接头，商谈成交。敌占区商人感到方便，边地群众亦感到“组织起来省时又保险”。仅十二月份，即换入食盐×××斤。为及时解决群众必需品，在不固定地址，设立少数吞吐机构，专门吸收港来物资，附带输出，使敌占区商人主动来交易，消除他们货物来了找不到顾主的顾虑。久青同志觉得单纯处罚解决不了走私问题，他从帮助大家，找正当生财之道着手，帮助群众计算：什么可出入？什么有利？再对一再教育不改的人，采取群众讨论，巩固处理的方法，走私乃大为减少。对逃来难民组织他们，利用敌占区亲戚关系，将我山杂货输出，换入食盐等必需品，某难民一家三口，毛驴一头，做此生产，两月净赚小米十五石，其它难民户最低亦赚三石。久青同志工作艰苦，生活俭朴，去年初冬从××边地回来，还未穿袜子，仅休息一日，又到前面去。领导作风民主，与群众极易接近，初见他都以为他是一个老百姓。他这种不避艰苦的精神和深入的群众作风，使我边地经济斗争，取得很大的成绩。
