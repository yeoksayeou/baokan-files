    [This dispatch comes from the front lines of the Ji Lu Yu region on the 23rd.]
    Responding to the call to defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and in answer to the regards of Commanders Liu and Deng, the First Unit of a certain field hospital on the front lines saw 149 wounded soldiers, recovered from their injuries, return to the front within a week. Unrecovered soldiers and residents of the village gave them a warm send-off. The unrecovered soldiers shouted, "We will catch up soon, see you at the front!" Currently, one-third of the wounded soldiers from various field hospitals in the front have returned to the front lines to kill the enemy.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd] The battle cry of "Eliminate the Chiang-Hu army! Defend Chairman Mao!" resounds throughout the Shandong liberated area. All the military and civilians, regarding the Northwest People's Liberation Army's voluntary withdrawal from Yan'an and the temporary occupation of an empty city by the Chiang-Hu army, unanimously believe that the Chiang army has now taken on a large burden, and the People's Liberation Army will more easily eliminate the invaders. The "People's Hero First Company" of a certain unit in East China is working even harder to improve its skills, resolutely expressing its determination to fight for even greater victories in East China. More than a hundred workers who withdrew from the Zaozhuang mining area immediately joined the guerrillas upon hearing the news. The Lunan Workers' Detachment, the Hui Detachment, and others also immediately mobilized to strike the enemy. Upon hearing the news, military and government organizations in central Shandong immediately deepened the organization and inspection of spring plowing and support for the front lines, preparing to use even greater strength to strike the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. An old man in a certain village on the edge of the Jiaodong area entrusted the government to forward a treasured ginseng root to Chairman Mao to express his condolences. All 37 million people in Shandong Province believe that our army's voluntary withdrawal from Yan'an will allow for more mobile operations, and this will increase their confidence in victory.
