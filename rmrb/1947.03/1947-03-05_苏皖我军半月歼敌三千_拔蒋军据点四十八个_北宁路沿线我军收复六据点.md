Xinhua News Agency, Central China, March 3rd: The soldiers and civilians in the newly liberated areas of Jiangsu and Anhui, south to the Yangtze River and north to the Longhai Railway, are actively launching a counter-"mopping up" war. In the first half of February (from the 1st to the 17th), a total of 3,261 Chiang's soldiers below the battalion commander level and "Home Return Corps" were annihilated, and 77 light and heavy machine guns and 8,115 rifles and carbines were seized. Among the 48 captured strongholds, including 28 locations along the Ru (Gao) Jue (Gang) line in central Jiangsu, such as Tangjiayuan, Zhujiadu, and Caizhen, more than 10 locations in Donggou and Dongqiao in the early district of northern Jiangsu, and more than 10 locations concentrated in Shijiaqu and Yanghua in the coastal area. They also once attacked Wangzhigang near the suburbs of Baoying, Juegang, a major town in eastern Rugao, and Matang. This caused Chiang's army to be stretched thin, completely compressed into the area line, while the soldiers and civilians of Jiangsu and Anhui changed from small persistence to large-scale recovery.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, March 3rd: The Eighth Route Army, active in the southern coastal area of the Beining Railway, successively recovered Nannijing, belonging to Changli, and Xiaoji and Zaoyuan, belonging to Tangshan, two key Chiang-puppet points on the 19th and 20th of last month. In this battle, more than 100 puppet "Brotherhood Society" leaders including Wang Zilin from the Feng (Run) Luan (County) area were captured, and 7 light and heavy machine guns and more than 200 rifles and carbines were seized. Another working team that advanced on both sides of the Pingjin Road successively recovered the Chiang-puppet strongholds of Muchang, Yangfang, and Daxinzhuang between Wuqing, Anping, and Hexiwu at the end of last month.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, March 3rd: Since the 3rd Corps of the Chiang army in Shijiazhuang and the eastern section of the Zhengtai Line assembled and advanced northward along the Pinghan Road, it launched attacks against the local Eighth Route Army on the 15th and 18th of last month, but were repelled. Changshou Station, which was once occupied by it on the 20th, was also quickly restored. In the three battles, more than 230 Chiang soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, March 3rd: Qiao Richeng's bandit troops, entrenched in Ying County, Yanbei, concentrated a total of four battalions of their Provisional 1st Regiment, etc., and launched a large-scale grain robbery and conscription in Fengyong, southeast of Ying County, on the 2nd. The Eighth Route Army rushed to rescue the people upon hearing the news. Qiao's bandits resisted stubbornly in the village. After only four hours of fierce fighting, most of the bandit army was wiped out. A total of 135 enemy troops, including Battalion Commander Qiao Jinming, were killed and 125 were captured. 26 large carts of grain robbed from the people were intercepted and immediately returned to the masses.
