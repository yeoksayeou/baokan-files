Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 18th: TASS reports: On March 17th, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Stalin, received French Foreign Minister Bidault. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Joxe, were also present.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 20th: United Press reports: On March 18th, a commentator from the American Columbia Broadcasting Corporation broadcast from Moscow: "Significant events have begun to occur outside the Moscow Conference. French Foreign Minister Bidault has visited Stalin in the Kremlin. Other foreign ministers present, Marshall of the United States and Bevin of Britain, will also request talks with Stalin. Both Marshall and Bevin are eager to meet with the Soviet leader. Britain is keen to discuss revising and extending the twenty-year treaty with the Soviet Union. As for what Marshall will discuss, it can be stated with certainty that he will not be talking about the weather. Bidault's initial invitation to the Kremlin, especially with Molotov present, is of great significance." McGedoff of the American National Broadcasting Company broadcast from the Soviet capital on the same day: "During Bidault's visit to Stalin, the talks lasted nearly two hours, and among the many issues they discussed, the major problems currently facing Germany were undoubtedly addressed."

    贝文将与斯大林商讨修改苏英盟约
    【新华社延安十八日电】塔斯社报导：三月十七日，苏联部长委员会主席斯大林接见法外长比道尔，当时苏外长莫洛托夫与法驻苏大使贾德鲁亦在座。
    【新华社延安二十日电】合众社讯：美哥伦比亚广播公司评论员十八日自莫斯科广播称：“重大之事件已开始在莫斯科会议之外发生，法外长比道尔已进克里姆林宫访见斯大林。其他来此之英美外长马歇尔及贝文，亦将要求与斯氏座谈，马贝二氏均亟欲会见苏联首要。英国亟欲商谈修改并延长与苏联二十年盟约问题，至于马歇尔将谈论何事，可以确定者即彼所谈者必非天气。比道尔首获克里姆林宫之邀，尤以莫洛托夫亦在座，实具非常之意义。”美国国家广播公司之麦杰道夫于同日自苏京广播称：“比道尔访谒斯大林时，会谈约近两小时，彼等所谈论之甚多问题中，无疑曾谈及德国目前之重大问题”。
