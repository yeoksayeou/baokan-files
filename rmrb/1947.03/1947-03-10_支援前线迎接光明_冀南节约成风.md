　　【Ji'nan News, 8th】To support the front lines, a wave of thrift has swept through various organizations in the Ji'nan area. The Military Region Headquarters, from cadres to soldiers, a total of 93 people, saved 44 summer uniforms, 179 pairs of shoes, 31 pairs of socks, 76 towels, and 1,126 catties of grain for allowances, all according to their own thrift plans. The Health Section decided to save half of its monthly office expenses, and also to collect firewood in the fields, not allowing the public to provide firewood for burning, and to use prescription paper to wrap medicine for patients. The Ordnance Section stipulated that lights should not be lit during evening study and discussion sessions, and only when working and writing. External correspondence should use office paper, and internal correspondence should use waste paper and old forms. The Political Department currently has 16 cadres, guards, and communicators, who have saved 49 towels, 45 pairs of shoes, 20 pairs of socks, 12 summer uniforms, and 480 catties of grain for allowances.

　　The Supply Department, in order to tighten office expenditures, stipulated that office lamp oil should be issued sparingly, except for the horse stable and kitchen, which should receive a little more, with the rest receiving only 5 qian each. Each pen nib should be used for 20 days. Waste newspapers should be used to make envelopes. Ink should be uniformly prepared by the management section, which can reduce usage by 60,000 yuan per month compared to the past.

　　The Second Printing Factory of the Ji'nan Bank had each section and individual universally formulate thrift plans. The leading cadres of the Third Section voluntarily cancelled the use of orderlies, which can save 9,100 yuan per month. Fourteen cadres in the First Section collectively quit smoking, and the cadres in the Second Section decided not to smoke cigarettes, but to smoke dry tobacco. In the past, the iron and carpentry group used fire to burn triangular iron to save effort, but now they put in more effort and do not use fire, saving 50 pounds of coal per day. The clinic used to use seven people, now it retains five, and does a better job than before. Seventy out of the ninety people in the Second Section voluntarily donated wages totaling 75,570 yuan, to be sent to the front lines. Family member Wang Cilan proposed not to rely on men for food, because relying on men is relying on the public, which would increase the burden on men and the public. In the future, she will definitely work hard to produce.

　　The Fourth District Committee emphasized that thrift and frugality should focus on a grain of rice, a piece of firewood, and a yuan of money, accumulating small savings to support the front lines. Since January, in addition to saving one liang of rice per person per day, the naturally ventilated stove in the communal kitchen has been changed to a bellows stove. In mid-January, in addition to the 5,000 yuan for the bellows, 20,000 yuan can be saved. After saving on matches, 100 boxes can be saved, equivalent to 5,000 yuan. Last year, the communication squad's vehicle wheels, in addition to replacing major parts, were completely repaired by themselves, and the wheels were specifically allocated, with individuals responsible for management, competing to save money from the 50 catties of rice allocated for repairs for each vehicle. Using coarse paper and waste paper to print envelopes can also save an expense. Currently, all savings have been collected to 50,000 yuan, which is prepared to be sent to the front within the month.

　　【Ji'nan News, 8th】The Ji'nan Jian'guo College has formulated a production plan for the first half of the year, deciding to complete a production task worth 3,201,000 yuan to subsidize public miscellaneous expenses. In terms of vegetable funds, the General Affairs Section of the school headquarters is responsible for completing a production task of 1,392,000 yuan, and each team completes 1,475,000 yuan. 40,000 catties of millet are used as the production fund for each team, and 60,000 catties of millet are used as the production fund for the General Affairs Section. In addition to continuing to expand the factory buildings and operate a steamed bun shop, all the cadres, miscellaneous personnel, and students in the college are currently brewing plans for growing vegetables, indigo, tobacco leaves, leaching salt, accumulating fertilizer, and spinning textiles.
