Experiences of Deepening the Movement in Lucheng Fifth District

The mass movement in the Fifth District began in late September 1945. It went through the anti-traitor movement from September to the end of the year, the rent reduction movement from January to March 1946, and entered the in-depth stage in March. In April, it fully turned to production. After the wheat harvest, a check and elimination campaign was launched. Before the autumn harvest, a review of the liberation was conducted. After the autumn harvest, a vigorous wheat field management campaign was carried out, until the current ideological transformation campaign. After five movements, the landlords launched three counter-attacks, and the masses fought back four times. Some experiences were gained in the in-depth movement that lasted for more than a year.

Self-satisfaction is the enemy of in-depth movement, and it must be checked again and again, and deepened again and again.

In the spring and summer of last year, we checked and found that the landlords had not been defeated, nor had they bowed their heads. Special agents were active around Machang Daizhuang. Therefore, a leak-checking campaign was launched. Because we did not face the backward elements, the landlords were fought in turns in a "gliding steamwing" manner, suppressing the arrogance of special agent landlords' counter-attacks. The originally active people were still active, and the originally backward people were still backward. Everyone was complacent, and the summer harvest began, and the movement stopped. In the autumn, after studying the "May 4th" instructions, the district cadres concentrated on checking the work in Zhangzhuang and found thirty-two poor peasant households. The landlords put needles in the peasants' rice bowls and poured urine on the peasants' bodies, thus breaking the thinking of all district cadres and village cadres and masses. The leadership proposed five not-leaving (not leaving a poor peasant, not leaving a backward element, not leaving a problem, not leaving feudal ideas, not leaving a landlord) as the standard for inspection, and as the order of inspection. Cadres and activists from various villages conducted door-to-door inspections, breaking complacency and launching a campaign to speak out grievances facing the backward elements, forming a very fierce movement. When the autumn harvest began, the movement was suspended again. At the same time, we encountered preparations for war after the autumn, and the cadres' complacency was extremely serious, and the landlords launched another counter-attack. At that time, the slogan "If self-satisfaction is not eliminated, the peasants will suffer and the landlords will laugh" was put forward, and mass inspections of poor peasants, backward elements, and landlords' counter-attacks were carried out in the peasant association. It was discovered that most women, the elderly, and a group of middle peasants were still backward, and the rumors of special agents were discovered, exposing the extremely despicable and vulgar, and varied counter-attack conspiracies of the landlords. The movement was launched under the slogan of "uniting to check fields and oppose counter-attacks" until today's ideological transformation, all in one go. In the middle, there were also several times of complacency and almost-done thinking, but due to checking again and again, it was possible to deepen again and again. Finally, a new complacency arose, and all district cadres were concentrated again, and an ideological check (ideological test) was conducted in the advanced village of Licun Gou, and it was found that 28 out of 161 people were honest peasants, breaking the new complacency.

From the historical experience of five movements, three counter-attacks, and four repeated checks in the past seventeen months, we realize that: the landlord class is very stubborn and cunning; the ideological liberation of peasants is not easy; self-satisfaction is the enemy of in-depth movement. Only by checking again and again can we constantly overcome self-satisfaction and deepen again and again. The inspection in the Fifth District has developed from checking the landlords first to checking the poor peasants and backward elements first; from the cadres' inspection to the masses' inspection; from the economic and political inspection to the ideological inspection.

Unify the demands of advanced and backward masses, and launch the "backward" to form a movement of the broad masses.

After the autumn harvest, in the midst of war preparations, special agents spread rumors, saying: "The East is red, a dragon is about to come out, the sky is about to change." The landlord's counter-attack was steady (they accepted the experience of counter-attacking before the summer harvest). The cadres and activists were complacent and could not see it. The landlord of Wangcun threatened the wife of the political director, Kuanxin, saying: "The Central Army will come over in a few days and kill you two first." She was very weak and secretly asked people to guarantee her safety. The landlord did not want her to participate in the struggle again; she promised to give the landlord's old mother a bedpan when the Central Army came. This matter was not known to Kuanxin until she made a self-criticism at the district women's congress. At this time, the cadres, activists, and liberated masses were all engaged in production. A large cart could earn 20,000 yuan at a time in Handan, and two times could earn an old cow, while the backward elements were mostly pessimistic and disappointed. The liberated masses said they were stubborn. In this situation, to form a movement to check the fields, we must unify the demands of advanced and backward masses. At this time, based on the fact that backward masses kept things for the landlords, we proposed "If there is one backward element, the landlord will have one more strength, and the peasants will have one less strength," and called on "mobilizing the backward elements to dig the landlords' foundations." In the ideological transformation in Gaojiazhuang, on the third day, it was counted that the ideology of 58 masses had been transformed, and everyone became complacent, clamoring not to engage in field checking but to engage in production. After checking again, it was found that only one woman in the first group had transformed her ideology, and the rest were backward, so everyone was asked to discuss "Whose strength is the backward element?" and called on everyone to "face their own families", "Whose strength is it if their own wives cannot be mobilized?" Lao Chengshui said that he attended meetings and struggles and distributed fruits, but his wife secretly dug up and gave five sheng of corn to the landlord at home. Chengshui questioned her, and she initially only admitted three sheng. Chengshui said: "She sends food and drink to the landlord, isn't that the landlord's strength? She dug up five sheng for the landlord, but told me three sheng, she is close to the landlord and far from me. I want to be active, but she is holding me back, saying that if the sky changes, she will kill us old couple. I don't listen, she says: Old man, if you don't listen to me, don't sleep with me!" Many people had this experience, and everyone concluded: "We are like fighting a war with the landlords. If there is one backward element, the landlord will have one more person. If half of the village is backward, they will capture us, and we will not be able to capture them." In this way, the demands of advanced and backward masses were unified, and facing the backward, mobilizing women, mobilizing their own wives, old fathers, and old mothers, formed a lively mass movement.

Putting Down the Burden

The landlords in the Fifth District resisted the mass struggle, some of them had been preparing since the Anti-Japanese War; some of them had just liberated themselves and put their clothes, furniture, grain, land, and silver dollars in the homes of the peasants. At that time, the peasants were not aware, afraid of the change of the sky, and talked about affection, so they carried the burden and dared not look up in the movement because of concerns. Therefore, in mobilizing the backward masses, it is inevitable to touch on the issue of putting down the burden. On this issue, there were two lines: one was like Zhangzhuang, where the peasants who kept the burden were beaten, and the burden was beaten out, but some were beaten three times and still could not put it down; as a result, the peasants became more backward. The other was to call on the automatic release of the burden in ideological mobilization. When Song Yushan Village in Jiacun was just liberated, he saved three shi of wheat and a leather suitcase for Niu Jinbao, a killer, and also saved the clothes of two other landlords. From the liberation to last autumn, he did not say a word, and lowered his head at the meeting, fearing that others would be active and expose him: At the same time; he also pulled three other middle peasants to follow him backward, saying: "Are you afraid that the struggle will not come to our heads?" In the pre-autumn check and liberation, he was mobilized to speak out his grievances. After he woke up, he put down the burden and said: "Niu Jinbao harassed our family and oppressed us so much that we dare not look up, it's not that I'm backward." So he became an activist, and he also mobilized the three middle peasants he had pulled. In speaking out grievances, the cadres proposed "Don't be a warehouse for the landlords," and one after another put down the burdens that were sent to the landlords. A total of eighty-one families before and after. The total number of peasants who sent things to the landlords accounted for 30% of the total number of households in the village. Huang Xiaoyan's mother had always nursed children and begged for food for the landlord, gave birth to five children, gave three to others, died one, and there was one more son. In the ideological transformation, she figured it out and put down the burden. She saved things for eight landlords in three districts and five villages. In Linzhang, the masses did not fight out the clothes from the beginning of the struggle to the liberation check. This time, in the ideological transformation, the masses realized, and they spoke out and released the burden. Out of sixty households in the village, thirty-one households released the burden, and seventy-two pieces of clothes were released in one day, and eighty-two other items. The clothes released in one day were more than the clothes fought for in one year. Experience proves that only by doing a good job in ideological mobilization can a conscious movement to put down the burden be formed. Only when the peasants put down the burden will the landlords feel isolated, otherwise, the landlords will not bow their heads.

Transforming Cadres with Mass Power in the Movement

Although the "knots" existing between cadres and the masses are not deep-rooted, they are also numerous. In the past, the treatment was to condone cadres, only seeing their merits, forgiving their shortcomings, and as a result, "raising a cat and raising a tiger," the more they were raised, the bigger they became; if it became unbearable, they would be dismissed and attacked. In this in-depth movement, Linzhang, Nanshe and other villages created preliminary experience in transforming cadres with mass power.

Mao Kui, the village chief of Linzhang Village, and Xinhe, the public security officer, were originally activists in the movement before being selected as the village chief and public security officer. Both of them were caught by Dong Shuanzhu, a special agent landlord in the village, for their weakness of prostituting themselves, and he pimped for them. As a result, the three people became a top leader. When the district trained peasants and held ideological transformation meetings, many cadres, activists, and masses from the village went. In the four villages, the masses spoke out their grievances, and on the first day, they all spoke out about the cadres, especially Xinhe and Mao Kui. Tiancheng's mother cried loudly, saying that the cadres had harmed her son. Her son joined the army last autumn, deserted and ran home, and was sick at home. The village sent him to the district in the middle of the night, and he died of illness in the wind. The cadres reflected on their style at the mass meeting and admitted their mistakes. Tiancheng ran back. Originally, the village cadres decided at the meeting to send a letter to the district first, and then send him back to the team after he recovered from his illness. Dong Shuanzhu, who received education and training in the district, came back and said that he was worth half a district cadre, insisting that he had to be sent. After discussion, the masses said: "Tiancheng and Tuchang led the masses to fight against Dong Shuanzhu. This is a landlord counter-attack that harmed the new soldier. The cadres were fooled by Dong Shuanzhu." The masses turned to Dong Shuanzhu and spoke out their grievances, and Dong Shuanzhu was fought. In the ideological transformation, the masses compared the old and new cadres. In the past, when he was the village chief, he said what was what and rode on the heads of the basic people. This time, when he was a cadre, he had to go through the masses for everything, and if he did something wrong, he had to reflect on it; in the past, the gang of people who maintained the meeting, took the basic people to support the difference, they ate meat and food, didn't they eat our blood and sweat? This time, the cadres did not divide much of the fruits of the struggle; that gang of people only managed to support the difference and ask for food, and this time, the cadres are leading the liberation, really one is heaven and the other is underground. In this way, with the power of the masses, the cadres were separated from the special agents, the cadres made self-criticism, and the masses expressed the merits of the cadres, the cadres realized the power of the masses, laid the foundation for the masses to supervise the cadres in the future, and the relationship between the cadres and the masses was close and normal. This movement is still in progress. Only recently has it begun to address the relationship between cadres and the masses. It is planned to let the masses complain freely, help the cadres to reflect, lay the foundation for the masses to supervise the cadres, and select the most active, upright, highly conscious, capable, and promising people to the leading group to unite the masses of the whole village and lay the foundation for the promotion of district cadres in the future.

    潞城五区深入运动的经验
    五区的群众运动是从四五年九月下旬开始的，经过了九月至年底反奸、四六年元月至三月的灭租，三月间已进入深入阶段，四月间全面转向生产，麦收后，开展一次查灭，秋收前检查翻身，秋收后大力开展了麦田，直到现在的思想大翻身，经过了五次运动，地主三次进行反攻，群众四次反复斗争，在持统了一年之久的深入运动中获得一些经验。
  自满思想是深入运动的敌人，必须检查再检查、深入再深入。
    去年春夏之交，我们检查到地主并没有打垮，也没有低头，特务以马厂带庄为中心大肆活动，于是开展了查漏运动，由于没有面对落后，结果来了个“溜蒸翼”把地主轮番又斗了一回，压下了特务地主反攻的气焰，原来积极的还积极，原来落后的仍落后，大家自满，夏收开始了，运动停下来。秋天学习了“五四”指示，集中区干部检查了张庄工作，发现了三十二户贫农，地主往农民饭碗里下针，往农民身上倒尿盆，因而打破了全体区干部以及村干部群众的思想，领导上提出五不留（不留一个贫农，不留一个落后分子，不留一个问题，不留封建思想，不留一个地主）作为检查的标准，按照先后作为检查的顺序，各村干部积极分子进行了挨门挨户的检查，打破了自满，开展了诉苦面向落后，形成非常猛烈的运动。秋收开始，运动又暂停，同时又遇到秋后备战，干部自满极严重，地主又有反攻，当时提出“自满思想不打掉，农民吃苦地主笑”的口号，在农会中进行了群众性的检查贫农落后和地主反攻。又发现了大部妇女、老人、和一批中农还落后，发现了特务的造谣，揭发了地主极其卑鄙龌龊，五花八门的反攻阴谋，在“团结查田反反攻”的口号下开展了运动，直到今天的思想大翻身，一气呵成。当中也曾几度产生自满差不多思想，但由于检查再检查、才做到深入再深入。最后又产生了新的自满思想，又集中了全区区干部，在先进村李村沟进行了思想大检查（思想测验），发现一六一人中有二十八个人是老实农民，又打破了新的自满思想。
    从十七个月来五次运动，三次反反攻，四次反复检查的历史经验中我们认识到：地主阶级十分顽强狡猾；农民思想解放不是轻而易举；自满思想是深入运动的敌人。只有检查再检查，才能不断克服自满，才能做到深入再深入。五区的检查是由先检查地主发展到先检查贫农、落后；由干部的检查发展到群众的检查；由经济政治的检查，发展到思想的检查。
    统一先进群众和落后群众的要求，把发动“落后”形成广大群众的运动。
    秋收以后，在备战当中，特务大造谣，说：“东方红，要出龙，天要变”。地主反攻是稳扎稳打（他们接受了夏收前反反攻的经验）干部积极分子自满看不见，王村地主威胁到政治主任宽心的老婆说：“中央军不几天就过来，先杀你俩口。”她很懦弱，偷偷地要求人家保证。地主不叫她再参加斗争；她答应中央军过来给地主老娘端尿盆。这件事直到全区妇女大会上她作了反省，宽心根本不知道。这时干部积极分子，翻身群众都大闹生产，一辆大车下一次邯郸赚两万，两次赚一个老牛，而落后分子大都悲观失望，翻了身的群众反而说他们顽固。在这种情形下，要把查田形成运动，只有统一先进群众和落后群众的要求，这时我们根据落后群众保存地主东西的事实，提出“有一个落后分子，地主多一分力量，农民少一分力量，”号召“发动落后分子，挖地主墙脚”。在高家庄思想大翻身中，第三天统计了一下有五十八个群众思想翻了身，大家自满起来，嚷着不搞查田间生产。又检查了一下，发现第一组中妇女只有一个思想翻了身，其余都落后，就叫大家讨论“落后分子是谁的力量？”号召大家“面向自己家”，“自己老婆发动不起来是谁的力量”？老成水说他开会斗争分了果实，他老婆在家偷偷挖给地主五升玉茭，成水追问她，她起初只承认三升。成水说：“她给地主送吃喝，还不是地主力量？挖给地主五升，给我说三升，跟地主近，跟我远，我要积极，她拉后腿，说变了天杀我老俩，我不听，她说：老汉你不听我说，你不要和我在一起躺！”许多人都有这经验，大家结论说：“咱和地主好比打仗，有一个落后分子，地主那边多一个人，全村有一半落后分子，人家就擒住咱，咱就擒不住人家。”这样就统一了先进群众和落后群众的要求，把面向落后，发动妇女，发动自己老婆、老爹、老娘，形成了一个热火朝天的群众性的运动。
  放包袱
    五区地主抵抗群众斗争，有的是从抗日战争时代就作了准备的；有的是刚一解放时把自己的衣服、家具、粮食、土地、银洋放到农民家里，那时农民不觉悟、怕变天、讲情面，就背上了包袱，在运动中因为有顾虑。不敢抬头。因而在发动落后群众时，必然接触到放包袱的问题。在这问题上曾经存在两条路线：一条是像张庄把寄包袱的农民打了，打出包袱来，但有的打了三次还放不完；结果农民越落后了。另一条是在思想发动中号召自动放包袱，贾村宋玉山庄刚解放时保存下杀人精牛进宝的麦子三石，皮箱一个，还保存另外两家地主的衣服，从解放后到去秋他没有发过一句言，开会就低着头，怕别人都积极了露出了他：同时；他又拉了另外三家中农也跟着落后，说：“你怕斗争轮不到咱们头上来？”秋前检查翻身中，发动他诉苦，以后他觉悟起来，把包袱放下来说：“牛进宝屙了咱一家，压的咱死死的，不敢抬头，不是我落后。”于是他变成积极分子，把他拉的那三家中农也发动起来，在诉苦中干部提出“不给地主作仓库”，接二连三地把寄地主的包袱放下来，前前后后共八十一家。总计寄地主东西的农民占全村户数的百分之三十。黄小燕他娘，一贯给地主奶孩子要饭，生了五个孩子，给了人家三个，死了一个，还有一个儿，在思想大翻身中，她想通了，放下包袱，她保存了三个区、五个村八个地主的东西。临漳群众从开始斗争到翻身检查没有斗出衣服来，这次思想大翻身中群众觉悟了，诉着诉着就放开包袱，全村六十户，就有三十一户放包袱的，一天放下衣服七十二件，其他物件八十二件，一天放的衣服比斗了一年还要多。经验证明：只有思想发动搞的好，才能形成自觉的放包袱运动，只有农民放下包袱，地主才会感到孤立，否则，地主不会低头。
  运动中以群众力量改造干部
    干部与群众存在的“疙瘩”，虽然根子不深，但也很多，以前处理是姑息干部，只看到功劳，原谅其缺点，结果“养过猫养虎”，越养越大；弄到不可开交就撤职打击。在这次深入运动中，临漳、南舍等村创造了以群众力量改造干部的初步经验。
    临漳村长卯魁、公安员新和，原来是运动中的积极分子，才选拔为村长和公安员，两个人都因为嫖破鞋，被该村特务地主董拴柱抓住了弱点，给他们拉皮条，结果三个人成了一把手，区上普训农民，开思想大翻身会时，该村去的干部积极分子和群众很多，四村发动诉苦，群众头一天全诉到干部身上，尤其对新和和卯魁，天成他娘诉的大哭起来，说干部害了她儿，她儿去秋参军，开小差跑回来，病在家，村上半夜送到区上，大风一吹病死了。干部们在群众会上反省了自己作风，承认了自己错误。天成跑回来原来村干部会上决定先给区上送个信，病好了再送他归队人家董拴柱到区里受教育训回来，说是顶半个区干部，硬说不送不行，群众一讨论说：“天成和土长领导群众斗争过董拴柱，这是地主反攻害了新战士，干部是跟上董拴柱上了当。”群众一下子转到董拴柱身上诉起苦来，斗争了董拴柱。思想大翻身中群众对比了新旧干部，以前当村长说什是什骑在基本人头上，这会当干部什么也得通过群众，干错了还要反省反省；以前维持会那伙办公人，带着基本人去支差，他吃肉吃粮，还不是吃的咱的血汗，这会干部斗争果实也不多分；那伙人光管支差要粮食，这会干部是领导翻身，真是一个天上，一个地下。这样以群众力量，使干部和特务分了家，干部作了反省，群众又表了干部功劳，干部体会到群众力量，打下今后群众监督干部的基础，干群关系密切与正常起来。这个运动还正在进行，日前才开始接触到解决干部与群众关系，计划放手让群众发牢骚，帮助干部反省，打下群众监督干部的基础，并选拔最积极、正派、觉悟高、有能力、有前途的人到领导集团中来，以团结全村群众，并为今后提拔区干部打下基础。
