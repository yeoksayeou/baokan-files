　　Half-Month Battle Report in This Region

　　Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Military and Civilians Crush Chiang's "Mopping-Up" Operations, Guerrilla Warfare Universally Launched in Southern Shanxi and Other Places

　　In the first half of March, after a month of continuous heroic fighting, the officers and soldiers of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu battlefield basically crushed the "mopping-up" and "suppression" operations of Chiang's seven brigades (including the 138th Brigade, 174th Brigade, and 176th Brigade of the Reorganized 48th Division; the New 10th Brigade and 183rd Brigade of the Reorganized 58th Division; the New 15th Brigade of the 72nd Division; and the 64th Brigade of the 15th Division) and the 17th Traffic Police Regiment (local county teams not included in the calculation) around March 10th. They recovered Zhecheng and Suixian, attacked Taikang twice, raided the North Gate of Huaiyang and the East Gate of Xiayi, and annihilated and contained a large number of Chiang's troops (details in this newspaper on the 17th), effectively coordinating the operations of our army on various battlefields, especially the East China battlefield, making Chiang's plan to "clear the south of the Longhai Railway" a pipe dream, and giving infinite encouragement to all the soldiers and civilians who are fighting hard behind enemy lines. This further proves that it is entirely possible and necessary to persist in the enemy's rear liberated areas.

　　In the Jilu-Jin and northern Henan areas, after Chiang's main force, the Reorganized 27th Army (including the 75th Division, 85th Division, and 72nd Division of the 5th Army), invaded east from Yuncheng and Juye and occupied Wenshang and Ningyang, the cities occupied by Chiang's army on the western Jilu-Yu front became even more empty. Our army recovered Yuncheng on the 3rd of this month, and small units penetrated deep into the enemy's rear and won successive victories. On March 8th, our army intercepted the Chiang family's activity headquarters' motor vehicle battalion and the 1st transport regiment near Heze, seizing eighteen trucks. On February 22nd, a company escorting transport was annihilated between Shanxian and Caoxian. All of these things demonstrate how the supply lines of Chiang's troops deep in the liberated areas are being severely threatened by our guerrilla warfare. Furthermore, due to the supplies our army obtained during the offensive operations in the southwestern Shandong area in January and February, the majority of local bandits in the area have been cleared by us, and the people's confidence in victory has been further strengthened. Chiang's troops are trapped in isolated cities, both deaf and blind, and can no longer be as rampant as they were during their first offensive on the cities of southwestern Shandong after September of last year. Chiang's army on the Pinghan Railway, in addition to concentrating some forces (the 32nd Division and the 49th Brigade) to defend key points and lines, has no power to make any reckless moves. This is completely different from the situation four and a half months ago when they bared their fangs and claws to invade Daming, Linzhang and other places, vainly attempting to open up the Pinghan Railway.

　　In the Jinzhong and Jinan areas, after seven brigades of Chiang's direct line troops, including the 1st Division, 90th Division, and 27th Division, were transferred west, the defense of Yuncheng and Wenxi was taken over by the 55th Brigade of the 38th Division. The area north of Wenxi to Hongdong (including Linfen and Fushan) is still guarded by the 30th Division (Northwest Army, former subordinates of Sun Lianzhong). The defense of Guixian and Zhaocheng is taken over by the 69th Division drawn from Yan Xishan and the 8th, 9th, and 10th Brigades originally south of the Zhengtai Railway and the Taiyuan-Jiaozuo Railway. Under this situation of extremely weak Chiang's army defense, our guerrilla warfare in the Chiang-occupied areas and behind enemy lines has been universally launched. For example, our Jilu local armed forces have won three consecutive victories from February 11th to 22nd, attacking two strongholds, killing or wounding 13 enemies, capturing 42 alive, seizing 2 light machine guns, 17 rifles, and 1 pistol, and destroying 2 bunkers. The Anbei local armed forces also won three battles in three days from February 10th to 14th, capturing the Ducun stronghold, capturing 15 enemies, seizing 9 rifles and 3 pistols, creating a model for the activities of small units behind enemy lines.

　　本区半月战况
    豫皖苏军民粉碎蒋军“扫荡”晋南等地游击战争普遍开展
    三月上半月，豫皖苏战场官军经过连续达一个月的英勇战斗之后，已在三月十日前后基本上粉碎了蒋军七个旅（包括整四十八师之一三八旅、一七四旅、一七六旅，整五十八师之新十旅、一八三旅，七十二师之新十五旅，十五师之六十四旅）及一个交警十七总队的“扫荡”与“清剿”（各县地方团队尚未计算在内），收复柘城、睢县，两度攻入太康，袭入淮阳北关、夏邑东关，并歼灭与牵制了大批蒋军（详情见十七日本报），有效地配合了各战场，特别是华东战场我军的作战，使蒋军“肃清陇海路南”的计划成为泡影，给一切在敌后方艰苦奋斗的军民以无限鼓舞，更加证明了坚持敌后解放区是完全可能而且必要的。
    冀鲁晋、豫北方临蒋军主力整廿七军（包括五军七十五师、八十五师、七十二师）自郓城、巨野东犯占我汶上、宁阳以后，冀鲁豫西线各被占城市更形空虚，我军于本月三日收复郓城，更以小部队深入敌后活动连获胜利。三月八日我军在荷泽附近，截获蒋家活动总部汽车营及辎重第一团，大卡车十八辆。二月二十二日在单县、曹县间歼灭掩护运输之一个连；都说明了深入解放区的蒋军，其补给线是如何遭受我游击战争的严重威胁。且由于我军一、二两月在鲁西南地区攻势作战的给养，该区土顽大部分为我扫清，群众胜利信心更加坚定。蒋军困守孤城，既聋且瞎，再不能像去年九月以后第一次进攻鲁西南各城时的猖狂了。平汉线蒋军则除了集中一部兵力（三十二师及四十九旅）固守点线之外，绝无力作任何蠢动。与四个半月以前张牙舞爪侵占大名、临漳等地，妄图打通平汉线时迥然不同。
    晋中、晋南方面，蒋军嫡系第一师、九十师、二十七师等七个旅兵力西调之后，运城闻喜防务已交三十八师五十五旅接替，闻喜以北至洪洞（包括临汾、浮山等地）仍由三十师（西北军，孙连仲旧部）担任守备，龟县、赵城等地防务则由阎锡山抽调六十九师及原在正太线及太线以南的第八、九、十总队等部接充。在此种蒋军守备十分空虚的情况下，我在蒋占区、敌后方的游击战争已普遍开展起来。如我稷麓地方武装，自二月十一日至二十二日连续获得三次胜利，攻入据点两处，毙伤敌十三人，生俘四十二人，缴轻机枪二挺、步枪十七支、短枪一支，烧毁碉堡两座。安北地方武装亦于二月十日至十四日内三战三捷，攻占杜村据点，俘敌十五名，缴步枪九支、短枪三支，创造了敌后小部队活动的范例。
                （三月一日至十五日）
