　　District Cadres Lead Village Cadres
    Sincere Self-Criticism and Return of Ill-Gotten Gains
    Neidong District, Yaoshan Summarizes Experience in Returning Ill-Gotten Gains
    [Our Jinnan Dispatch, 18th] In the land reform movement in Neidong District, Yaoshan, some cadres bought fruits at low prices or misappropriated them, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and affecting the unity between cadres and the masses, as well as hindering the in-depth progress of the movement. After discovering this, the leadership immediately educated and mobilized district and village cadres, organized self-reflection and self-criticism, made self-criticism in front of the masses, and returned the ill-gotten gains, resolving the conflicts between cadres and the masses. The cadres regained the support of the masses. The following are some of the experiences in dealing with this issue: 1. Simply starting with village cadres does not work. For example, when some ill-gotten gains were not cleared, when village cadres were asked to clear them, they said, "What about the district cadres who bought them cheaply? How can we write the public announcement?" The district cadres of Neidong District took the lead in examining their own mistakes and were determined to return the ill-gotten gains. When the village cadres saw the district cadres reflecting and examining themselves, they were inspired to think about the issue and launched a self-examination movement. 2. Loudly put forward slogans, repeatedly mobilize, and carry out self-examination and mutual examination. In Neidong District, slogans such as "Returning is glorious, the masses support it; not returning is a shame and will be resented by the masses," "Washing your face should be thorough, not only washing yourself, but also helping others wash, those who wash clean are models, who doesn't wash is the most shameful," were put forward. Then, through large and small meetings, and individual talks, in-depth and repeated mobilization was carried out. Finally, mutual examination and "face washing" were carried out for those who were lagging behind, so that the return work was carried out smoothly.

　　区干带头推动村干
    诚恳反省退还果实
    尧山内东区总结退果实经验
    【本报冀南十八日电】尧山内东区在土地改革运动中，有些干部贱买或挪用果实，引起群众不满，影响干群团结和运动的深入。领导上发现后，当即教育动员区村干部，组织反省检讨，在群众面前自我批评，退出果实，解除了干群的圪瘩，干部重新得到群众拥护。这一问题的处理，有以下几点经验：一、单纯从村干着手行不通。如有些果实未清理，让村干清理时，村干说：“某区干贱买的怎么办，如何下笔公布？”内东区区干首先带头检查了自己错误，决心退还果实，村干见区干反省检查，随之就打通了思想，展开了检查运动。二、响亮提出口号，反复的动员，展开自我检查和互相检查。在内东区提出“退还是光荣，群众拥护；不退是耻辱，为群众所不满。”“洗脸要洗净，不光自己洗，还要帮助别人洗，洗的净是模范，谁不洗最丢脸”等口号。接着大小会、个别谈，深入反复动员，最后对落后的进行互相检查洗脸，这样才顺利的开展了退还工作。
