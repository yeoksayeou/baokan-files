Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: In the vicinity of Liuzhuang and Baiju in Dongtai, occupied by Jiang's troops, horrifying mass burial pits have been discovered. According to refugees who fled Liuzhuang, those buried alive were young and able-bodied men who resisted being drafted by Jiang's troops, numbering over one hundred in total. One refugee witnessed in the dead of night a group of Jiang soldiers with shovels escorting several youths from the town to behind Zishan Mountain in eastern Liuzhuang. They dug a large pit, tied the victims' hands and feet, threw them into the pit face down, and then covered them with dirt. After each layer of dirt, they poured a bucket of water and stamped it flat. Similar tragedies have also been discovered in Daba Bridge and other areas south of Baiju.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: After Jiang's troops occupied central Jiangsu, taxes and levies became exorbitant. Currently, 30% of households are without food. Unable to bear the oppression, the people have risen up to resist the levies. The Jiang-controlled district public office recently convened three tax collection meetings, all of which were fruitless. At the first meeting, not a single person spoke. At the second meeting, the Jiang side voluntarily reduced the "bullet tax" to one dou per mu and the "self-defense tax" to three dou per mu, but still, no one spoke. At the third meeting, when the Jiang side further increased the "bullet tax" to two dou per mu, the masses at the meeting angrily shouted, "This is not allowing us to live!" and dispersed in a burst. The struggle against levies is now spreading throughout the four townships of Hai'an, with the unanimous slogan of the masses being "Unite to resist the levies!"

　　东台蒋军活埋青年
    被惨害者先后达百余人
    【新华社华中六日电】蒋军侵踞之东台刘庄、白驹两地附近，均发现骇人听闻之埋人坑。据自刘庄逃出之难民谈称：被活埋者均系抗拒蒋军抓丁之青壮年，先后已达百余人。一难民曾于深夜目击一部荷锹之蒋军自镇上押解青年数人，至刘庄东紫山背后，挖一大坑，将被害者手足捆住，背面朝下扔入坑内，然后用泥土盖上。每盖一层泥，即浇一桶水，用脚踩平。在白驹南大桥等地圩亦发现同样惨案。
    【新华社华中六日电】蒋军侵占苏中后捐税繁重，目前已有十分之三户口断炊，人民不堪逼迫，纷起抗捐。蒋记区公署日前曾召集三次收捐会，均无收获。第一次开会群众没有一人发言，第二次蒋方自动减低“子弹捐”至每亩一斗，“自卫捐”每亩三斗，但仍没有一人发言。第三次会上蒋方更增加“子弹捐”到每亩二斗时，会场群众即奋然高呼：“这不要我们活命了！”一哄而散。现抗捐斗争正在海安四乡蔓延，群众一致的口号是“团结起来抗捐！”
