　　Gaoping Re-examination Reveals:
    Over One Hundred and Fifty Impoverished Peasant Households Did Not Receive a Single Plot of Land During the Movement
    [Our Taiyue dispatch, 12th] Gaoping has begun a re-examination of land distribution, discovering that 153 extremely poor and lower-poor peasant households, and 2,845 poor peasant households did not receive a single plot of land in this movement. 225 poor peasant households and 2,413 middle-peasant households who were harmed during the anti-traitor and anti-hegemon struggle also did not receive compensation. Conversely, 26 rich peasant households were allocated 168 mu of land, and 151 well-to-do middle-peasant households were allocated 817 mu of land. The majority of poor peasants did not achieve liberation. Based on the experience of the Mi Shan base, the main reasons for this incompleteness are threefold: First, the work was not meticulous enough, leaving feudal remnants unaddressed. Attention was only paid to open struggles, neglecting the landlords and land hidden in the shadows. Second, individual bad cadres shielded the targets of struggle. Jia Zuoyuan, the former chairman of the Mi Shan Farmers' Association, protected Song Sun-sheng, who had served as a puppet village chief. The masses detained Song Sun-sheng seven times, but he released him seven times. Third, class divisions were not clearly defined, and Zhang Huo-sun, a Mi Shan landlord who had always relied on exploitation, was let off. In addition, some cadres obtained excessive or embezzled gains, and some villages adopted a method of distributing gains based on problems, so the extremely poor and poor peasants did not receive land, while the rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants received a lot.

　　高平复查发现
    百五十余户赤贫农运动中未得一分地
    【本报太岳十二日电】高平开始分田复查，发现一百五十三户赤贫和下贫农、二千八百四十五户贫农在此次运动中未分得一分土地。在反奸霸斗争中被损害的二百二十五户贫农，二千四百十三户中农亦未得到补偿。相反的却有二十六户富农倒分得土地一百六十八亩，一百五十一户富裕中农分得土地八百一十七亩，贫苦农民大部没翻身。根据米山基点的经验，造成不彻底的主要原因有三：一、工作不细致，遗漏下封建尾巴。光抓明处斗，忽视了暗处的地主及土地。二、个别坏干部包庇斗争对象。米山前任农会主席贾作元包庇当过伪村长的宋孙生，群众曾七次扣压宋孙生，他就放了七次。三、阶级割分不明确，把米山地主一直靠剥削度日的张火孙等放过了。此外有的干部多得和贪污果实，有的村庄采用以问题分果实的方法，所以赤贫、贫农未分得土地，而富农和富裕中农却得到很多。
