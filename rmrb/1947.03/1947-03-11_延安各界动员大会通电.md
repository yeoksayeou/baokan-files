Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: The Yan'an All-Circles Rally for the Defense of the Border Region and the Defense of Yan'an, held on the 8th, sent a telegram to all the military and civilians of the liberated areas, all compatriots across the country, and all overseas compatriots. The original telegram is as follows (excerpts):

Traitor Chiang Kai-shek, with the active support and encouragement of American imperialism, on the one hand, drove away the liaison personnel of the Communist Party of China, openly declaring a complete break; on the other hand, ordered Hu Zongnan to assemble seventeen brigades, defying the world, to launch an attack on our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the democratic holy land of Yan'an. This absurd measure of Chiang Kai-shek fully exposes that his own military, political, and financial crisis has reached an irreparable point, and he vainly attempts to capture Yan'an to restore his extremely low morale, in order to prolong the civil war and maintain his traitorous dictatorial rule for a while. Everyone knows that this desperate adventure of Chiang Kai-shek will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. In the past six months, the military and civilians of the liberated areas have annihilated a total of sixty-five brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's invading army, capturing countless American-equipped weapons. The recent great victory in Shandong has further shaken Chiang Kai-shek's entire civil war machine. The Chiang army is getting weaker and weaker as it fights, and its defeat is set; while the military and civilians of the liberated areas are getting stronger and stronger as they fight, and the final victory of the patriotic self-defense war is beyond doubt. In addition, the autocratic dictatorship of the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families, with finances on the verge of bankruptcy, the economy in collapse, and the people living in misery and resentment, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule has become the target of public criticism, at the end of its rope! Yet Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of his American masters, dares to brazenly use the attack on Yan'an as a means to save his own crisis and to flaunt his military power to the world, only to show his recklessness and dig his own grave. We call on all the military and civilians of our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to quickly mobilize and engage in a sacred battle to defend the land, defend Yan'an, and defend Chairman Mao, and to cut off the bloody claws of the traitor at the gates of Yan'an. We demand that all 140 million people and 1.5 million People's Liberation Army soldiers and millions of militiamen in the entire liberated area rise up together to launch a more fierce annihilating blow against the Chiang army to defend Yan'an and defend Chairman Mao, and strive for a more brilliant victory, so as to quickly end the civil war and end Chiang Kai-shek's disastrous dictatorial rule. The Chiang army soldiers on the front lines of the civil war should resolutely refuse to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek, not become sinners of their compatriots, and should immediately lay down their arms and join the People's Liberation Army to fight for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland. At this critical moment, we are especially willing to work together with all sectors of society and democratic parties across the country to fight against the interference of American imperialists and against the reactionary rule of the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families, and to fight for the minimum democratic rights and survival rights of the Chinese people. If the bloody hands of American imperialism are not shaken off for a day, and the spine of the traitor is not broken for a day, the Chinese people will not have independence, peace, and democracy for a day. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorial rule is also a disaster for the thirteen million overseas Chinese. It is the root cause of the humiliation and persecution suffered by overseas Chinese. However, Chiang Kai-shek is now using remittances from overseas Chinese as capital to expand the civil war and attack Yan'an. Therefore, all overseas Chinese must take urgent steps to stop Chiang Kai-shek and accelerate the bankruptcy of his dictatorial civil war policy. The people of Yan'an from all walks of life call on compatriots across the country at this mobilization rally today to unite more closely. We must work hard to expand and consolidate the national united front against American imperialist aggression and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship, smash Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to attack Yan'an, crush all of Chiang Kai-shek's offensives, quickly end Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and strive to establish an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China! We will surely win, long live the independent, peaceful, and democratic New China!

Yan'an All-Circles Rally for the Defense of the Border Region and the Defense of Yan'an.

　　延安各界动员大会通电
    【新华社延安九日电】八日延安各界保卫边区、保卫延安动员大会，通电全解放区军民，全国各界同胞及海外各界侨胞，原电如下：（函略）
    卖国贼蒋介石在美国帝国主义的积极支持与怂恿下，一面赶走中共联络人员，公然宣布全面决裂；一面令胡宗南集结十七个旅，冒天下之大不韪，发动向我陕甘宁边区与民主圣地延安的进攻。蒋介石这种荒谬绝伦的措施，完全暴露其自己军事、政治、财政的危机已达到无可挽救的地步，而妄图以攻占延安挽回其十分低落的士气，以便延续内战，维持其卖国的独裁统治苟延残喘于一时。尽人皆知，蒋介石这种孤注一掷的冒险，必然遭受可耻的失败。解放区军民于过去半年内，已经歼灭蒋介石进犯军主力六十五个旅之众，缴获其美械装备无算。最近山东大捷，更令蒋介石的内战机构发生全盘的动摇。蒋军愈战愈弱，败局已定；而解放区军民则愈战愈强，爱国自卫战争之最后胜利已无可置疑。加之，蒋宋孔陈四大家族之专制独裁，财政濒于破产，经济陷于崩溃，民不聊生，民怨沸腾，蒋介石的反动统治已成众矢之的，强弩之末！乃蒋介石在其美国主子的支持下，竟敢放肆地以进攻延安作为挽救其自身危机，借以向世界眩耀其武力之手段，徒见甚卤莽灭裂，自掘坟墓而已。我们号召我陕甘宁边区全体军民，迅速动员起来，为保卫土地、保卫延安、保卫毛主席进行神圣的战斗，将卖国贼的血爪斩断在延安门外。我们要求全解放区一万万四千万人民，一百五十万人民解放军和数百万民兵，一致奋起为保卫延安、保卫毛主席展开对蒋军更猛烈的歼灭性打击，争取更辉煌的胜利，以便迅速结束内战，结束蒋介石的祸国殃民的独裁统治。内战前线上的蒋军将士们，应该坚决拒绝替蒋介石当炮灰，不作自己同胞的罪人，应该立即放下武器参加人民解放军，为祖国的独立和平民主而奋斗。当此时局紧张之际，我们尤愿与全国各界同胞及民主党派共同奋勉，为反对美帝国主义者干涉、反对蒋宋孔陈四大家族的反动统治而斗争，为争取中国人民最低限度的民主权利与生存权利而斗争。美帝国主义的血手一天不摆脱，卖国贼的脊梁一天不打断，中国人民便一天没有独立和平与民主。同时，蒋介石的卖国独裁统治亦即是一千三百万海外侨胞的灾难，它是侨胞横遭凌辱迫害之总根源；但是蒋介石现在却利用侨胞的汇款作为扩大内战进攻延安之资本，因此全体侨胞必须采取紧急步骤制止蒋介石，加速其独裁内战政策的破产。延安各界人民今天在这一动员大会上向全国同胞呼吁更加紧密团结，我们要努力扩大和巩固反对美帝国主义侵略与蒋介石卖国独裁的民族统一战线，击破蒋介石进攻延安的阴谋，粉碎蒋介石的全部攻势，迅速结束蒋介石的统治，为建立一个独立和平民主的新中国而奋斗！我们一定胜利，独立和平民主的新中国万岁！
    延安各界保卫边区保卫延安动员大会。
    中华民国三十六年三月八日。
