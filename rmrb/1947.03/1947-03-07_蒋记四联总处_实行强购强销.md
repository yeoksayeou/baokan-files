Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 5th: Nanjing Dispatch: The "Four Joint Offices," a financial dictatorship organization of the Four Big Families, chaired personally by Chiang Kai-shek, passed the "Four Joint Offices This Year's Work Program" on the 27th, to further exploit private production and marketing enterprises and peasant handicraft workers. The program stipulates that, in accordance with the "Daily Necessities Supply Measures," various industries will be "assisted" as much as possible through methods such as collateral loans, foreign exchange mortgages, and loans, depending on the production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales situation. This will force "production and marketing enterprises that receive loans to accept the dispatch of personnel by the competent authorities and loan granting agencies to be responsible for verifying accounts at any time," and force private production enterprises that obtain loans to sell their products at official prices. "The competent supply authorities may order part or all of their products at a certain price," and those who "violate the regulations" will be "punished by the competent authorities." Furthermore, private transportation enterprises are forced to transport the "supplies" of the Four Big Families at the "lowest price" and with "priority capital." In addition, the program also stipulates methods to deprive peasants through "loans." The "loan" targets include important materials such as cotton, grain, silk cocoons, tea, and tung oil. According to the above agricultural products, all are "supplies" or exports that the Four Big Families will acquire.
