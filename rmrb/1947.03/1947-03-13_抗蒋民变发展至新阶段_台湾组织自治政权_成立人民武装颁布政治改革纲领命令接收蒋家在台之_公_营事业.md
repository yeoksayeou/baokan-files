Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 11th: The anti-Chiang people's uprising in Taiwan has developed to the stage of organizing a temporary autonomous regime. The "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" has de facto become the temporary autonomous regime of Taiwan, and has promulgated important programs and orders, possessing a certain amount of armed force. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Taipei on the 9th: "The Taiwan Province February 28th Incident Handling Committee has brazenly established itself as the government." Furthermore, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 9th: The orders of Chiang's government's Taiwan Administrative Governor "Chen Yi are only effective within the provincial government." It is reported that since the February 28th massacre of citizens in Taipei by the Chiang government sparked unrest throughout Taiwan, the Taiwanese people have established their own armed forces to maintain order and traffic. The Chiang government's Taiwan authorities announced on the 6th of this month measures such as "restructuring the provincial government" in an attempt to maintain the Chiang family's rule and soften popular resistance. This deception has been seen through by the Taiwanese people and has failed miserably. According to Central News Agency reports, the February 28th Committee has promulgated several important orders, one of which is to order the establishment of a handling bureau to deal with the aftermath of the incident, and another to establish a political affairs bureau responsible for planning the reform of Taiwan Province's politics. The Political Affairs Bureau will be established before March 15th, and the members of the bureau will be elected by universal suffrage of the Taiwanese people, first by each township electing one candidate, and then by each city council selecting them. The allocation of quotas is as follows: Taipei City 2, Taipei County 3, Keelung City 1, Hsinchu City 2, Hsinchu County 3, Taichung City 1, Taichung County 4, Changhua City 1, Chiayi City 1, Tainan City 1, Tainan County 4, Kaohsiung City 1, Kaohsiung County 3, Pingtung City 1, Penghu County 1, Hualien County 1, Taitung County 1, totaling 31.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 11th: According to an 8th Central News Agency report: The "February 28th Handling Committee" organized by the people of Taiwan passed the "Proposal for Reforming Taiwan Province's Politics" consisting of 32 articles on the 7th and "submitted" it to Chen Yi. The full text is as follows: "(1) Formulate an autonomy law as the highest model for provincial politics, in order to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals of nation-building.
