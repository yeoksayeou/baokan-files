    Yubei Frontline Troops
    Remarkable Results Achieved by On-the-Spot Appeals
    [This Dispatch] Our comrade Zhao Lixiang reports from the Yubei front: All commanders and fighters of the Yubei frontline troops attach great importance to on-the-spot appeals and actively participate. Significant results have been achieved in recent battles. For example: In the Battle of Loulou, Zhang Xiangshun, a heroic soldier of our "Shenyang" unit, shouted when the engineers blasted a hole in the blockhouse, "The Eighth Route Army treats prisoners well! I was a prisoner of the 30th Army, not only was I not killed, but now I am a squad leader; come over, and you will be treated well too!" Immediately, two men ran out to negotiate surrender, but they were shot dead by Liang Zhemin of the enemy's machine gun company. He then shouted, "Shoot your officers! Whoever doesn't order you to surrender, tie them up and there's a reward!" As a result, the three officers who were forcing them not to surrender were tied up, and all the men surrendered. In the Battle of Zhongshan, Comrade Wang Dao, Deputy Political Instructor of our "Tongjiang" unit, proposed the slogan to the enemy: "Brothers of the New 5th Army, reinforcements are not coming, the blockhouse is useless, surrender is the only way out!" "The guns belong to others, but your lives are your own, it's not worth dying for the officers!" This moved the soldiers' hearts, and seventy-two men laid down their weapons. The Cao Family Blockhouse was guarded by seventeen enemy soldiers. Our "Shenyang" unit, with military force, appealed to the enemy: "You will come over sooner or later, we guarantee not to touch your personal belongings! We have already captured your platoon leader!" The enemies discussed and surrendered, and our soldiers applauded to welcome them. In the Battle of Ji’s Family Mountain, a squad of enemies was holed up in a house and refused to come out. Yang Shaofa, a newly liberated soldier from our "Tongjiang" unit, shouted a few loud sentences and won them over. The slogan was: "Brothers, come out and surrender! I came from Zhao Family Factory, the Eighth Route Army treats us very well." During the Tangyin Campaign, while pursuing the 32nd Division, Hou Zhongjie, a newly liberated soldier from Zhao Family Factory, shouted: "Don't run, come over! The Eighth Route Army gives us everything!" "The Eighth Route Army treats us very well, the officers are very kind." After hearing the appeals, more than a dozen enemies returned to surrender, and the quartermaster who had already crossed the river also turned back. The following experiences have been gained from practical on-the-spot appeals: (1) The combination of military force and political offensive makes appeals most effective. (2) Organizing newly liberated soldiers to appeal to the enemy, using their personal experiences to explain our army's policies, makes it easiest for the enemy to believe. If prisoners from the same battle are won over, educated, and organized to make appeals, the effect is even greater. (3) When wavering enemies encounter difficulties (such as officers' supervision and obstruction) and are afraid to surrender, the appeal personnel should immediately and proactively propose specific methods to indicate a way out, and call on them to take action, so as to accelerate their determination to surrender. (4) The content of the appeals should be very relevant to the specific enemy situation and best meet their inner needs. Therefore, during each battle preparation, investigations and studies must be conducted to understand their political situation and research specific and vivid appeal content and slogans. In battle, it is especially necessary to understand the current situation of the enemy from the prisoners.

    豫北前线部队
    火线喊话成绩显著
    【本报讯】豫北前线赵理湘同志报导：豫北前线部队全体指战员对火线喊话极为重视，并踊跃参加。在最近几次战斗中，取得显著成绩。如：鹿楼战斗，我“沈阳”部杀敌英雄张祥顺同志，当工兵把炮楼炸开一个窟窿时，他喊道：“八路军优待俘虏！我是三十军的俘虏，不但没杀，现在当班长；你们过来，也优待！”即刻跑出两个接洽缴枪，但却被敌机枪连梁哲民打死了。他机动的又喊：“打死你们当官的！谁不叫缴枪，捆起来有赏！”结果把三个威逼不叫缴枪的官长捆起、而全部人缴了枪。钟山战斗，我“通江”部队副政指王道同志向敌提出口号：“新五军弟兄们，援兵来不了，炮楼不顶事，缴枪才是出路！”“枪是人家的，命是自己的，替长官卖命犯不着！”打动了士兵的心，七十二人放下武器。曹家炮楼由十七个敌人驻守，我“沈阳”部队在军事威力下对敌喊话：“你们迟早要过来，你们过来保证不动你们私人东西！我们已捉住你们的排长了！”敌人商量着缴了枪，我们战士鼓掌欢迎。姬家山战斗，敌人一个班守着屋子不出来，我“通江”部新解放战士杨少法，响亮的喊了几句，就争取过来。口号是：“弟兄们，出来缴枪吧！我是赵家厂过来的，八路军待我们很好。”汤阴战役，追击卅二师中途，从赵家厂新解放的战士侯中杰喊话：“不要跑啦，过来！八路军啥都发给！”“八路军对咱很好，当官的都很和气。”听了喊话，十几个敌人回来缴枪，已渡过河的事务长也转回来。从实际火线喊话中，获得如下经验：（一）军事威力结合政治攻势，喊话最易生效。（二）组织新解放战士向敌喊话，以现身说法来说明我军政策，最容易使敌人相信。同一战斗的俘虏，即争取教育组织他进行喊话，生效尤大。（三）当动摇的敌人遇到困难（如长官监督阻制等情）不敢缴枪时，喊话人员立刻即应主动提出具体方法指示出路，号召其行动起来，这样能加速缴枪决心。（四）喊话内容应非常切合具体的敌情，最能符合于其内心要求。因此在每次战斗准备时，即须进行调查研究，了解其政治情况，研究出具体生动的喊话内容与口号。在战斗中，随时从俘虏口中了解当前敌人的当前情况，尤为必要。
