　　[Our Newspaper Comprehensive News] The production and thrift movement continues in the Party, government, and civilian organs and schools in the Taihang area. Comrades from the Military Region Headquarters and Xinhua Daily are digging small plots of land by the riverbank after dinner. Many comrades from the General Affairs Department of the District Party Committee have learned to spin cotton. Comrades from the Administrative Office who go to the countryside have specially studied mobile production methods, starting production with the masses wherever they work, ensuring the completion of production tasks. The Taihang Trading Company, in Shexian County, transported tiles and broken soil from the Hengsheng Goods Store construction site to outside the city, earning 1,600 yuan for nine people in one afternoon. The Second District Committee eliminated small kitchens, and cadres quit smoking one after another, with the total savings in clothing, bedding, and daily necessities reaching 1,159,400 yuan. They collectively cultivated ten and a half mu of land and two and a half mu of vegetable gardens, aiming to be self-sufficient in vegetables throughout the year. All cadres and staff members of the Third Commissioner's Office are divided into six production groups to spin cotton, and eleven spinning wheels have already started turning. This year, Lucheng's local grain and funds require more than 450,000 jin of rice and 3.5 million yuan, which is planned to be entirely resolved through organ production. Mining coal, investing, providing low-interest grain loans, and tool factories, along with indirect income, will complete more than 17 million yuan; in addition, expenditures will be tightened, and systems such as prior approval before expenditure and preventing乱开支 of village funds will be established. Each person's monthly ration is reduced from 22.5 jin of flour to only 10 jin, saving more than 60,000 yuan for nine people annually. In terms of production, it is guaranteed that each person will cultivate 0.5 mu of wasteland, combined with handicraft production, it is estimated that each person will hand in 200 jin of rice annually. All staff members of the Jixi Cooperative General Store have set personal production and thrift plans, and even the cook has proposed saving 20 jin of firewood per month. A agricultural and sideline labor technology room has been established, equipped with hand-operated machines and spinning machines, to carry out textile and agricultural improvement research. All teachers and students of the Wu'an County Normal School use their spare time to spin cotton, and now 30 spinning wheels have been prepared; in addition, each class group has cultivated a total of 120 mu of wasteland. The Eighth Primary School of the county saves one liang of rice and one qian of oil and salt per person per day, and all the savings are used to support the army. Taihang Fourth Middle School proposed "not to relax a minute of spare time and complete the production task of handing in 10,000 yuan per person." The carpentry group has made five spinning wheels in three days, the ironworking group has made more than a dozen iron ingots in a few afternoons, the cotton batting group has taken the time to bat 12 jin of cotton in three days, and all 26 girls in the school have participated in cotton spinning. Up to now, the school has saved about 440,000 yuan. All primary school teachers in Zuoquan County have unanimously proposed to reduce the subsidy rice by three jin per person per month. Seventy students and five teachers of the Fifth High School each have a spinning wheel and are carrying out a production movement of one liang of cotton per day. The students' parents said, "Now the school is truly both civil and military." Two hundred and thirty teachers in Licheng reduce their salary rice by ten jin per person per month. Thirty teachers and students of Ping Shun No. 1 High School formed five weaving groups, each person spins an average of two liang of cotton per day, and the teachers also guarantee to plant 30 pumpkins per person to solve their own vegetable problems. Five teachers of Pingding No. 1 High School took the lead and proposed to save two liang of millet per person per day, launching a movement to support the front line with a handful of rice, and 16 publicly funded students have responded one after another. This movement has now penetrated into the front lines of the struggle against the enemy. When the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee held a meeting of party members and cadres on February 17, it also put forward a thrift plan and commended seven comrades including Han Yusheng. Some of them saved single clothes and shoes, and some of them saved allowances and food money.
