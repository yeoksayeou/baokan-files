Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 27th: The land reform in the central area of ​​Hebei has been largely completed by January of this year, and is currently being reviewed in conjunction with the war and production. According to statistics from 37 counties and cities including Gaoyang, Suning, Xinguo, and Shengfang, 6,287 villages have completed land reform, accounting for more than 83% of all villages. According to statistics from Raoyang based on villages, the highest number of households participating in the movement accounted for 97% of the total number of households, and the lowest accounted for 89%. According to statistics from 17 counties including Anguo, Raoyang, and Hejian, 555,659 mu of land have been returned to the farmers. The distribution of fruits has been quite extensive. For example, in Anping, 27,013 households have been allocated land, accounting for 58% of the total number of households in the county, and 85% of the population has received property. The rural areas that have undergone land reform have changed greatly. There is no extreme poverty in Dacheng County, and 2,760 poor farmers in Anping County have been promoted to middle peasants, and 96 tenant farmers have become owner-cultivators. In Suning County, 6,030 poor farmers have been promoted to middle peasants. Production enthusiasm has generally increased. Last winter, the production income from spinning and weaving alone in Anping reached 460 million yuan, which can be used for the winter consumption of 230,000 people; after the peasants in Yimen Village of the county turned over, they organized cooperatives, and those who invested accounted for more than 80% of the households in the village. Farmers in various places designated the day of liberation as the Liberation Day and held grand celebrations. Every family posted new couplets, just like the New Year; liberation songs and ditties could be heard everywhere. Li Jingzhong, a farmer in Shenxian County, was oppressed by the landlord in the past and became paralyzed. After turning over, he was able to walk with a cane. Guo Yaoqi, a farmer in Beijie, Xianxian County, became insane due to being angry with the landlord, but suddenly recovered after turning over. The farmers' love for their government and army has increased a hundredfold. When Taizhuang, Qingxian County, arranged for the collection of public grain last autumn, the village-level cadres only said one sentence, preparing to hold a meeting the next day to discuss it, but the masses paid it all on the same night. In order to protect their land and homes, 40,000 liberated farmers in central Hebei have joined the People's Liberation Army in two months, and various mass organizations have also achieved unprecedented development. According to statistics from 16 counties including Anping, Dacheng, and Raoyang, the number of farmer association members has increased by 128,043, the number of women members has increased by 88,482, and other organizations such as trade unions and youth organizations have also increased. A large number of new cadres have emerged in the movement. According to statistics from Raoyang, Suning, Anping, and Anxin counties alone, 950 activist voters have been promoted to village cadres. At present, the liberated farmers in various places are preparing to launch a large-scale production movement with great enthusiasm.
