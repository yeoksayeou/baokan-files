    Wholeheartedly Serving the People
    Cheng Shiru Declines "Support Grain"
    [This Newspaper Reports] "Zhoucun would be like a house without pillars if it lacked Cheng Shiru." This is the saying of the liberated peasants of Zhoucun (Yongnian). Cheng is the village head of Zhoucun, who cares about the emancipation of the masses at all times. Once, the chairman of the Farmers' Association planned to marry the daughter of the landlord Wang Mingde, who had been struggled against. When Cheng Shiru heard about it, he felt it was inappropriate and immediately questioned the chairman of the Farmers' Association: "His father was struggled against, will the masses be satisfied if we marry his daughter?" After this reminder, the chairman of the Farmers' Association suddenly realized the problem and immediately gave up the idea.
    During the fruit distribution, the evaluators assessed several thousand catties of "support" grain for the village cadres. Cheng Shiru firmly insisted on not taking it and said to the other village cadres: "The basic masses have not yet benefited, and we are getting things first, this will separate us from the masses." Under his influence, the village cadres finally refused the grain. At the village office's review meeting, he always criticized himself first, and then encouraged others to criticize themselves. Therefore, the whole village was united like one person, and all work was done ahead of other villages. Cheng Shiru has become a banner for the people in the surrounding villages.

    赤心为民
    程世如谢绝拥护粮
    【本报讯】“周村缺了程世如好比房子缺了柱”。这是周村（永年）翻身农民的口头禅。程是周村村长，时时刻刻关心群众翻身，有一次，农会主任打算娶被斗地主王明德家的闺女，程世如听说后，觉得事情不妥，马上向农会主任提出质问：“他父亲被斗，咱娶他家的闺女群众是否满意？”经这样一提，农会主任恍然大悟，马上打消了这个想头。
    分果实时，评议员给村干部评议了几千斤“拥护”粮，程世如坚决主张不要，并对其他村干说：“基本群众还未得到利益，咱先得了东西，这样咱们就会脱离群众。”在他的影响下，村干们终于拒绝了这项粮食。村公所检讨会上他总是先检讨自己，然后再推动别人检讨，因而全村团结得像一个人一样，一切工作都作到其他村的前面。程世如已成为周围村庄人民的一面大旗。
