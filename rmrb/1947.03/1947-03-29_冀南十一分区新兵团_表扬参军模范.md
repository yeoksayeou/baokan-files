    [Report from our Jinnan Office, 27th] The Eleventh Sub-district New Soldiers Regiment commended 93 military service models. During the two-week training process, the New Soldiers Regiment of this sub-district, from the squad to the regiment, democratically elected 97 military service models, including Jia Zitian, Liu Jindou, Zhang Tieming, Xu Dajian, Zhang Lianzhuang, Yang Zhenhai, Sun Zhanyun, Yun Wentian, Ma Yuzhao, Xie Dexing, Li Jintang, Ma Fuying, and Zhang Kaichang. They all voluntarily joined the army, did not take any property from the villagers, and led more than three young people to join the army, guaranteeing that they would not desert, would not go AWOL, would not ask for leave after joining the army, would work diligently, endure hardship, study well, and abide by discipline. To this end, the regimental headquarters held a grand commendation meeting for all new soldiers, commending the 97 military service models and calling on all new soldiers to learn from them. The villagers and elementary school students stationed in the villages celebrated the meeting with gongs and drums; Deputy Political Commissar Chen of the sub-district personally awarded honorary flowers and prizes, and took photos for commemoration. At the meeting, the regimental Political Commissar Shi called on everyone to learn from Comrade Jia Zitian and other military service models, and after listing Comrade Jia's exemplary deeds, said that the reason why their 97 comrades could become models was because they were able to discard personal interests and wholeheartedly serve the masses. The commendation meeting moved most of the new soldiers, who expressed their willingness to work hard in the future and become good revolutionary soldiers.
