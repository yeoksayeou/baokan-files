　　Jilu Yu No. 7 Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office
    Form Frontline Organ Work Group to Help Local People
    [This newspaper's Jilu Yu dispatch on the 10th] In the tense environment of guerrilla warfare, the Jilu Yu No. 7 Prefectural Committee and the directly subordinate organs of the Commissioner's Office formed a work group. Whenever they arrived at a stationed area, they would contact the leading organs of the stationed district to assist them in carrying out work such as war preparation and land reform. After specific division of labor, upon arriving in a village, some personnel would immediately convene village cadre meetings to promote our army's victories and strengthen war preparation, etc., and separately convene meetings of landless or land-poor households and mass meetings of the entire village in order to gain in-depth understanding, promptly correct deviations in the village, and stabilize the morale of the masses. This greatly helped the work among the masses in the stationed village, and enabled the leading organs to understand the situation of work at the lower levels in a timely manner.

　　冀鲁豫七地委暨专署
    组成前方机关工作组帮助驻地群众工作
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】七地委及专署直属机关在游击战争紧张环境中，组成一个工作组，每到一驻地即与驻区领导机关联络，帮助他们进行备战及土地改革等工作。经过具体分工，到村后部分人员立即召开村干会议，宣传我军胜利及加强备战等，并分头召集分地没得地户及全庄群众大会，以作深入了解，及时纠正庄里的偏向，稳定群众情绪。这样对驻村群众工作帮助很大，并使领导机关及时了解下层工作状况。
