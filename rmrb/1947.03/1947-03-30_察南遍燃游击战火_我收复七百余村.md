    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 28th: Guerrilla warfare has spread throughout Chahar South. Among the 1,112 administrative villages in the seven counties of Wei County, Zhuolu, Huaian, Yangyuan, Tianzhen, Xuanhua, and Huailai in Chahar South, 747 are currently under the control of the democratic government, where all laws and decrees are fully implemented. Local armed forces are active in the remaining 200-plus villages and are rapidly recovering. In this area, engulfed in the flames of guerrilla warfare, the Chiang-Fu forces' weakness of insufficient troop strength and being stretched thin is even more exposed. When the Chiang-Fu forces concentrated their troops to attack Yuan in February, Yangzhuang, Baile, Liushuzi, and other strongholds in Wei County and other places were forced to retreat by the militia guerrillas. The flames of guerrilla warfare even reached the urban area of Wei County. The Tianzhen County guerrilla squad persisted in fighting near the county seat, killing, wounding, and capturing 11 Chiang soldiers and arresting more than 20 secret agents last month. In the Battle of Bai Xiaoshan, Gao Quan, the deputy captain of the Tianzhen puppet security force, and five others were captured alive. The increasing number of Chiang-Fu soldiers deserting also illustrates the growing fear and unease within their ranks. In the seventh district of Wei County alone, 22 Chiang soldiers who surrendered have been taken in in the past two months, and over 100 members of the puppet security team have deserted on the Ping-Sui Railway Line in a single month.

    察南遍燃游击战火
    我收复七百余村
    【新华社晋察冀廿八日电】察南蔚县、涿鹿、怀安、阳原、天镇、宣化、怀来七县所属一千一百一十二个行政村中，目前有七百四十七个在民主政权控制之下，各种法令贯彻无阻。其余二百余个村经常有地方武装活动，正迅速恢复。该区在游击战争火海中，蒋傅军兵力不足，捉襟见肘之弱点更充分暴露。二月中蒋傅军集中兵力进攻源时，蔚县等地之杨庄、白乐、柳树子等于余据点均被民兵游击队逼退，游击战之火一直烧至蔚县城关。天城镇游击小队在县城附近坚持斗争，上月中毙伤俘蒋军十一名，捉特务二十余名；白小山战斗中活捉天镇伪保安分队长高全等五名。蒋傅军逃亡日多的事实，也说明着其内部日益增涨的恐惧与不安；仅蔚县七区，两月来即收容投诚之蒋军二十二名，平绥线上伪保安队一个月逃亡达百余名。
