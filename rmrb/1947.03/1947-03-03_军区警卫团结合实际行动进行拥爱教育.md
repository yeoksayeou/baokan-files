　　Military Region Guard Regiment Combines Practical Actions with Love-the-People Education
    [Our Dispatch] The cadres and soldiers of the Military Region Guard Regiment are combining their "Love-the-People" study with practical actions, further improving military-civilian relations. In the past, members of the 5th Company would secretly throw away coal on the road while carrying it. Some even complained, "I came here to be a soldier, not to suffer!" After "Love-the-People" study and self-criticism, they all realized that their labor was to save civilian manpower. On the 11th of last month, the company commander and political instructor took the lead in carrying coal from sixty li away. Along the way, everyone sang "For the Masses," and morale was unprecedentedly high. Seventy cadres and soldiers carried a total of 4,300 jin of coal, saving 43 head of livestock and 40 civilian laborers. An old man in his sixties said, "I have never seen a company commander and instructor carrying coal in my life. They truly deserve to be called the people's soldiers!" Furthermore, during a discipline inspection, the direct-affiliated unit of the regiment discovered that Qin Guoli had hidden 100 jin of wheat and three bundles for a landlord. After "Love-the-People" reflection, the soldier became aware of his mistake and confessed it at a mass meeting, handing the items over to the village for disposal. Influenced by him, many backward people who had been harboring landlords came forward to report their hidden items. According to incomplete statistics, there were over 154 items of clothing, bedding, etc., and over 400 jin of grain. Currently, the regiment's discipline inspection is further integrated with the tail-cutting movement in Yuquanling.

　　军区警卫团结合实际行动进行拥爱教育
    【本报讯】军区警卫团干部战士拥爱学习结合实际行动，进一步改善军民关系。该团五连从前担煤时，有人在半路上偷偷把煤扔掉，还有人抱怨说：“我是来当兵，不是来受苦！”经拥爱学习检讨后，都认识到自己劳动是为了节省民力。上月十一日连长与政指带头，到六十里外去担煤，一路上大家唱着“为了群众”的歌子，情绪空前高涨。干部战士七十人共担煤四千三百斤，节省牲口四十三头，民力四十个，一个六十多岁的老汉说：“一辈子没见连长指导员还担煤，真不愧人民的子弟兵呵！”又该团直属队在纪律检查中发现秦国利替地主隐藏麦子一百斤，包袱三个。经拥爱反省，该战士觉悟，在群众大会上承认错误，将东西交村上处理。在他影响下，有许多包庇地主的落后群众纷纷报出东西，据不完全统计，有衣被等一百五十四件，粮食四百余斤。现该团纪律检查与玉泉岭的割尾巴运动，进一步结合起来。
