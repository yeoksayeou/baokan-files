(Our Newspaper, Jinan, 27th Dispatch) After the farmers of Daxinzhuang in Yaoshan eliminated feudalism and distributed the fruits of their labor, they convened a mass meeting of the entire village on the sixteenth day of the second lunar month, attended by over 500 men and women. After the meeting began, Qi Zhenhe, the director of the Farmers' Association, held 330 old documents recovered from the landlords in his right hand and 360 new documents received from the government in his left hand. He raised the old documents and shouted, "These are our lifelines that were exploited and swindled away by the landlords. We must remember this blood debt!" Then he raised the new documents in his left hand and shouted, "These are the rice bowls that Chairman Mao led us to reclaim. We must always follow Chairman Mao!" Everyone shouted in unison, "Burn the old documents!" The documents, which were the basis for the landlords' deprivation of 660 mu of land from the peasants, instantly turned into a pile of ashes. Applause and laughter filled the meeting place. Immediately afterward, the new documents were distributed. Liu Laofeng, a desperately poor man in his seventies who received four mu of land and a house, accepted the deed and said with a smile, "Chairman Mao saved me!" He then bowed and kowtowed to Chairman Mao's portrait. Qi Zhenhe, who was allocated a brick house, angrily said after receiving his deed, "I've been a hired laborer for half my life and was terribly exploited by the landlords. My own fingerprints are on the documents being burned." He kicked the pile of ashes of the burned documents three times forcefully. Old Mingniang, in her fifties, received the new deed, smiling so wide she could barely close her mouth. She carefully folded the deed, wrapped it in several layers of a handkerchief, and happily said to her child, "Today is the sixteenth day of the second lunar month, the day we have land and a house. When your father died, he didn't leave us anything. This is Chairman Mao leading us to turn ourselves around, good child: don't forget when you grow up." After all 360 new documents were distributed, everyone unanimously decided to designate the sixteenth day of the second lunar month as Land Homecoming Day, and to hold a meeting every year on this day for commemoration.

    大辛庄农民欢庆翻身
    【本报冀南廿七日电】尧山大辛庄农民消灭封建、分配果实后，于旧历二月十六日，召开全村群众大会，到会男女五百余人。开会后，农会主任齐振河右手拿着三百三十张从地主手中追出的旧文书，左手拿着从政府领来的三百六十张新文书。他举起旧文书喊道：“这是咱们命根子，被地主剥削讹诈去的，咱们要记住这笔血债”！随又举起了左手的新文书喊道：“这是毛主席领导咱要回来的饭碗了，咱们要永远跟着毛主席走！”大家一齐喊起来：“把旧文书烧了！”地主剥夺农民的六百六十亩地的依据——文契，霎时变成一堆灰尘，群众掌声欢笑声充满了会场。紧接着分发新文书；七十多岁的赤贫刘老凤、分了四亩地，一处宅子，他接过文契，笑着说：“可是毛主席救了俺！”说着向毛主席的像又作揖又鞠躬。齐振河分了一处砖宅子，接过文书后，愤怒的说：“我住了半辈子雇工，被地主剥削的好苦，烧的文书就有我的亲手印。”他在烧的文书灰堆上狠狠的踢了三脚。五十多岁的老明娘接了新文书，笑的合不上嘴，把文书叠好，用手巾包了好几层，高兴的向孩子说：“今天是阴历二月十六，是咱有地有房的一天，你爹死时没给留一点东西，这是毛主席领导咱翻的身，好孩子：长大别忘了。”三百六十张新文书发完了，大家一致决议，规定二月十六日为土地回家纪念日，每年今天开会纪念。
