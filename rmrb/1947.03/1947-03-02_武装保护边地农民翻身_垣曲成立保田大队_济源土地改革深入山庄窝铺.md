　　Armed Protection for Border Area Peasants to Overthrow Landlords
    Yuanqu Establishes Land Protection Brigade
    Jiyuan Land Reform Penetrates Mountain Villages and Forts
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 28th] Yuanqu has established an armed Land Protection Brigade to protect the masses in carrying out land reform. Last winter, Yuanqu failed to combine support for the front lines with mass movements, so land reform was only carried out in eleven villages in the hinterland, and most of the border villages were untouched. The leadership also neglected the importance of armed protection for the masses in the border areas to carry out land reform. A certain cadre went alone to a village three miles away from the enemy to mobilize the masses, but failed to organize militia for joint defense. He was once surrounded by the enemy, and the masses still did not dare to act. At present, the entire county unifies the large and small armed forces and organizes the Land Protection Brigade, which is under the unified command of the county, district, and village headquarters to protect the masses' struggle. Cadres swear to live and die with the masses, stabilize the masses' emotions, and boldly settle accounts with landlords and despots.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 28th] Jiyuan border area land reform has shifted to the small mountain villages at the junction of Ji (yuan) and Meng (county). After Jiyuan's Yellow River coast completed land reform, it shifted to the forty or fifty small mountain villages belonging to the six villages of Nigou River, Hongtu River, and Langcha in the overlapping mountains of the sixth district on the border of Ji and Meng. This area is where Jiang special agent Wei Ansheng and Li Huifu's "reserve team" and "counter-settlement team" are active. The local masses were threatened and dared not rise up. Since February, the militia of the sixth district have been laying minefields at the passes of Yanmen and Cao'ao to lure the enemy into the trap. On the 20th, Wei Ansheng's "reserve team" attacked, stepping on a landmine and wounding several people. They also abandoned two corpses at Yanmenkou and fled back in panic. Since then, land reform has begun in this area. The land reform training courses run by the six villages of Hongtugou and others also ended at this time, and a vigorous movement began.

　　武装保护边地农民翻身
    垣曲成立保田大队
    济源土地改革深入山庄窝铺
    【本报太岳二十八日电】垣曲成立武装保田大队掩护群众进行土地改革。垣曲去冬未能把支援前线与群运结合，因此仅在腹地十一个村庄进行土地改革，大部边沿村庄未动，领导上也忽视武装掩护边沿区群众进行土地改革的重要性。某干部曾单身到距敌三里的村子发动群众，未组织民兵联防，曾被敌人包围，而群众仍是不敢动。目前全县统一大小武装，组织保田大队，由县区村指挥部统一指挥，掩护群众斗争。干部宣誓与群众同生共死，稳定群众情绪，大胆向地主、恶霸进行清算。
    【本报太岳二十八日电】济源边沿区土地改革转入济（源）孟（县）交界的山地小庄。济源黄河沿岸完成土地改革后，就转入济、孟边界六区山峦重叠之尼沟河、红土河、狼岔等六个村所属之四五十座小山庄。该区为蒋特卫安生、李惠甫之“后备队”、“倒算队”活动之所。当地群众被威胁不敢起来。二月起六区民兵在雁门、曹凹等隘口满布雷阵，诱敌入圈，二十日卫安生之“后备队”来袭，踏响地雷，炸伤数人。并在雁门口弃尸两俱怆惶逃回，从此该区开始了土地改革。红土沟等六个村所办之土地改革训练班亦于此时结束，开始轰轰烈烈的运动。
