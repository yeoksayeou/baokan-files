Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: According to TASS, Copenhagen, 26th: Danish newspapers reported that the Danish people, upon learning that Kilhart, a Republican Congressman from California, USA, suggested on the 25th that Truman be authorized to merge Iceland into a state of the United States and purchase Greenland, expressed indignation. The National Times stated that we are unwilling to mention what this American congressman suggested; Denmark will not give up Greenland, this idea is utterly absurd.

Editor's Note: The United States currently has air force bases in Narsarsuaq in southern Greenland and Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. Narsarsuaq is approximately 1,565 miles from Montreal, Canada, 1,855 miles from New York, and 2,215 miles from Berlin. Reykjavik is 1,390 miles from Paris, 1,175 miles from London, and 1,480 miles from Berlin. Therefore, these two places have become part of the "strategic central base" of the United States in Europe and North America.

　　美图侵占冰岛格陵兰丹麦舆论咸表愤慨
    【新华社延安一日电】据塔斯社哥本哈根二十六日电：丹麦报纸载称，丹麦人民在获悉美加州共和党众议员基尔哈特，于二十五日建议授权杜鲁门合并冰岛为美国一个州，并购买格陵兰之后，咸表愤慨。国民时报载称，我们对于这位美国议员不愿意提什么建议，丹麦不会让出格陵兰，这种念头实是荒谬之至。
    编者按：美国现在在格陵兰南部居理恩哈伯及冰岛首都的雷克加维克都有空军基地，居理恩哈伯距加拿大的蒙特娄约一五六五英里，距纽约一八五五英里，距柏林二二一五英里。雷达加维克距巴黎一三九○英里，距伦敦一一七五英里，距柏林一四八○英里。因而这两个地方成了美国在欧洲及北美“战略中心基地”之一部分。
