　　Sold Livestock and Homes, Not Enough to Satisfy Chiang’s Troops' Insatiable Extortion:
    Sixty-Year-Old Man from Shijian Village, Anyang, Hangs Himself in Resentment

    [Our newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 15th] The Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in Anyang extort in every possible way, causing many farmers to be ruined and their families destroyed. The masses describe the situation after the Chiang army occupied Anyang as: "Since there was a 'Caotou Jiang' (referring to Chiang Kai-shek), the people have suffered disaster. Since the scourge army came, people die, families are destroyed, and the lights are blown out." Wang Mantun, a sixty-year-old man from Shijian Village in the Sixth District, had a family of four. He hired a farmhand and bought six mu of dry land and a donkey. After the Chiang army occupied Shuiye, they used the excuse that his son was wearing good clothes, insisting that "no one but the Eighth Route Army wears such good clothes," and detained his son in Shuiye on November 13th, demanding that Wang Mantun pay 100,000 yuan to redeem him. Helpless, Wang paid the enemy with his only beloved donkey to redeem his son. On December 17th of last year, the puppet Bao Public Office again assessed him 80,000 yuan. The "Homecoming Corps" demanded it once a day, forcing him to sell all his houses (six rooms) completely, and paid 70,000 yuan. On New Year's Eve, amidst heavy snow, the whole family was in a state of being without food or shelter. The "Homecoming Corps" came to demand payment again, saying: "Bring money if you have it, bring people if you don't." After neighbors begged for mercy, they finally agreed to pay it all on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Just the second day after the New Year, the puppet Bao Public Office assessed him again, 2,000 yuan per mu of land, three catties of rice and two catties of flour. In the occupied area, land had long become a burden to the farmers. Wang Mantun could not sell the land to pay. In utter despair, Wang hanged himself that day. After Wang's death, the "Homecoming Corps" and the puppet Bao Public Office still forced his relatives to bear the land rights and pay the "public funds." The members of the same clan all said, "Wang's character is the same, but we are not one family." Relatives and friends said, "We haven't been in contact for a long time, and besides, we can't finish cultivating our own land." Wang Mantun's tragedy is just one of the thousands of tragedies under the Chiang and puppet troops' trampling in today's occupied area of Anyang.

    In addition: In Xujia Village, all 100 households, with 1,240 mu of land, were occupied by the Chiang army for only three months. They levied 840 catties of cotton per mu, levied 1,005,000 yuan, and assessed 2,600,400 yuan for gun purchase expenses per capita, 84,000 yuan for construction fees, 7,440 catties of rice for small labor, and 1,360 catties of millet for the door guard soldiers (special agent secret society armed forces), totaling 5,645,000 yuan and 8,800 catties of rice. Each mu amounts to 4,552.4 yuan and 7.125 catties of rice. The masses said: "Old Chiang! Why don't you just come and take the land? We can't live anyway!"

    蒋军到处烧杀掠抢
    人民切齿誓报血仇
　　卖了牲口卖尽房地不够蒋军无厌勒索
    安阳石涧村六十老翁含愤自缢
    【本报太行十五日电】安阳蒋伪百般勒索，不少农民家破人亡。群众对蒋军侵陷安阳后的情景描绘为：“自从有了草头将（指蒋介石），百姓头上有灾殃。自从来了遭殃军，人亡家破鬼吹灯。”六区石涧村六十老翁王满囤，全家四口人，他住了一个长工，买下六亩旱地、一头驴。蒋军侵占水冶后，即借口他儿穿的衣服好，硬说是“除了八路军没有穿这么好的人”，乃于十一月十三日，将其子扣押至水冶，让王满囤出十万元赎人。王无奈将其唯一心爱的毛驴付敌赎子。去年腊月十七日，伪保公所又派款八万元，“还乡团”一日催要一次，逼得无法，又将其所有房子（六间）完全卖掉，缴款七万元。旧年除夕，时逢大雪，全家正处于居食无着之际，“还乡团”又来催款，并渭：“有钱带钱，没钱带人。”后经邻居磕头求情，始答应大年初一日全数交清。刚过年第二天，伪保公所即又给他派款，每亩地二千元，三斤米二斤面。在沦陷区土地早已成为农民的累赘，王满囤又难能卖地付款，王万般无奈遂于当日上吊自尽：王死后，“还乡团”及伪保公所仍迫其本族亲友承受地权交付“公款”。本姓氏族们都说：“王字倒是一样，就是不一家。”亲友们说：“早就没来往啦，况且俺的地也种不完。”王满囤悲剧，仅是今日安阳沦陷区内蒋伪蹂躏下千万悲剧之一。
    又讯：许家村全村一百户人，一千二百四十亩地，蒋军侵占仅三个月，即按亩征花八百四十斤，征款十万零五千元，按丁派买枪款二百六十万零四千元，修建费八万四千元，派小工米七千四百四十斤，给门头兵（特务会门武装）派小米一千三百六十斤，连同零星招待，先后总共已出款五百六十四万五千元，出米八千八百斤。每亩合洋四千五百五十二元四，及米七斤一两。群众说：“老蒋！你干脆来收了地吧，咱反正不能活了！”
