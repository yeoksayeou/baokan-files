Taiyue, March 7th (Reported by this newspaper) – Two hundred and sixty-five liberated Chiang-Yan soldiers from Taiyue marched to the front lines of the patriotic self-defense war on the 28th of last month. After being liberated, they attended grievance meetings and realized the bloody feud between themselves and Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. Therefore, they resolved, "I would be unworthy if I didn't avenge this," and requested the Taiyue Military Region to join the Eighth Route Army and go to the front lines to perform meritorious service for the people and avenge themselves. More than three hundred people signed up, but only two hundred and sixty-five were approved, the rest being unable to go to the front lines due to illness or disability. On the 28th of last month, the local people held a farewell meeting, treating them like their own sons and brothers, giving them flowers and sending them gifts of comfort. Wang Tianyou, a quartermaster sergeant of the Eighth Regiment, said: "In the past, I was a watchdog for the Chiang family party, full of sins. Now I know that the only way to atone for my sins is to go to the front and kill the enemy." Li Yongcheng, a sergeant of the 31st Brigade, said excitedly: "I will avenge the murder of my parents on Chiang Kai-shek, and I must defeat this grandson of a turtle, Chiang Kai-shek!" All two hundred and sixty-five people shouted in unison: "Let's go and avenge our blood feud!"

　　太岳被解放蒋阎军参加我军奔赴前线
    【本报太岳七日电】太岳蒋阎军被解放士兵，已有二百六十五名于上月二十八日走上爱国自卫战争前线。他们被解放后，经过诉苦大会，认清了自己与蒋介石、阎锡山有着血海深仇、所以下定决心，“此仇不报枉为人”，遂向太岳军区请求参加八路军，上前线去为人民立功，为自己报仇。报名的有三百余人，但被批准的只有二百六十五名，其余因疾病、残疾不能上前线。当地老百姓特于上月二十八日开欢送大会，像对待自己的子弟兵似的，给他们戴花、送慰劳品。保八团的军需上士王天有说：“过去我是替蒋家党看家狗，一身罪过。现在知道了只有上前方去杀敌人，将功折罪。”三十一旅中士李永成激昂的说：“我和蒋介石报杀父亲母之仇，我非打败蒋介石这个龟孙子不可！”二百六十五人一致高呼：“报我们的血海深仇去！”
