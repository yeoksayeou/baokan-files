Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 26th: The Democratic Allied Army's Liaobei Local Corps and the Chang(ling) Huai(de) Workers' Team fiercely counterattacked Changling City, 100 li northwest of Changchun, on the evening of the 19th. The Chiang troops occupying the city offered slight resistance before fleeing in disarray, and the county seat was thus recovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: The 5th Regiment of the 2nd Division of Chiang's 52nd Army advanced towards the Tonghua area from Xinbin at 11:00 AM on the 23rd. The Democratic Allied Army's Liaodong Military Region forces engaged them in a fierce battle in the Wangqing area on the outskirts of Tonghua. By approximately 2:00 PM, the majority of the enemy force had been annihilated, with over 800 Chiang army officers and soldiers captured alive, over 300 killed or wounded, and the seized materials are currently being inventoried.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: Delayed news: On the morning of the 11th, a reporter inspected the Guojiatun and Liujiatun line in Dehui County along the Yitong River. This area was the scene of a fierce battle where the Democratic Allied Army severely attacked Chiang's 71st Army just a dozen hours prior. As the reporter entered the entrance of Guojiatun village, dozens of carts loaded with Chiang army guns and ammunition were being pulled by liberated area civilians, followed by a long line of newly captured American-made artillery vehicles. Further on were over 800 captured Chiang soldiers wearing gray coats, trudging forward in four columns. Later, the reporter visited the battlefield. This was a strip of land approximately half a li long on the eastern ridge outside the village. The trenches on both sides of the road were filled with Chiang army corpses, and military supplies were scattered everywhere. Many wounded Chiang soldiers were being helped by liberated area medical personnel, climbing onto more than twenty American-made trucks. One severely wounded soldier told the reporter through gritted teeth that after being wounded, he was subjected to several fierce strafing runs by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, adding another severe injury. The commander of a certain regiment of the Democratic Allied Army, who directed the battle of Liujiatun, recounted the course of the battle: "Advancing to the vicinity of Liujiatun were the Chiang army's 71st Army's Special Service Regiment, Artillery Battalion, Engineering Battalion, and the rear organs of the 87th Division. They were intercepted by our forces at dawn on the 10th. At the start of the battle, our commanders and fighters immediately forgot their fatigue from the past few days and charged valiantly. The Chiang troops occupied the deep trenches on both sides of the road on the eastern ridge and resisted stubbornly. Our army repeatedly charged. At this time, the ninth squad leader of a certain company was captured. While the Chiang army regimental commander was questioning him, our charging troops arrived. The squad leader seized the opportunity to grab the Chiang army commander's box cannon and immediately shot the Chiang army regimental commander dead. The enemy's position was thrown into chaos, and our army launched an attack at 4:00 AM, completely annihilating the Chiang troops in the area after ten hours."

    【新华社东北二十六日电】迟到消息，记者于十一日晨巡视伊通河畔德惠县属之郭家屯、刘家屯一线，此地在十数小时以前尚为民主联军痛击蒋军七十一军的激烈战场。当记者刚步入郭家屯村口时，见数十辆满载蒋军枪弹的大车正被解放区民夫们曳引而过，紧接着是新缴获的美制炮车的漫长行列，再过去就是八百多身穿灰大衣的被俘蒋军，他们排成四路纵队蹒跚前行。随后记者参观战场，这是在屯外东岗长约半里的一段地带，公路两侧深沟中填满了蒋军尸体，军用品则狼藉遍地，许多蒋军伤兵正得到解放区救护队员的扶持，攀登二十多辆美制大卡车。一个重伤号切齿地告诉记者：他负伤后还遭蒋介石飞机数次猛烈扫射，又添上一处重伤。指挥刘家屯战斗的民主联军某团长，回溯此次战斗经过称：“进抵刘家屯一带的是蒋军七十一军特务团炮兵营工兵营和八十七师的后方机关。十日拂晓为该部截击，战斗开始我指战员顿时忘却数日疲劳，勇猛冲击，蒋军占领东岗上公路两侧深沟顽抗，我军反复冲杀，此时曾有某连九班长为其俘去，当蒋军团长正询问时，我军冲锋部队赶至，该班长乘机夺得蒋军匣枪立将蒋军团长击毙，敌阵地立时大乱，我军自晨四时发动进攻，经十小时后即尽歼该地蒋军。”
