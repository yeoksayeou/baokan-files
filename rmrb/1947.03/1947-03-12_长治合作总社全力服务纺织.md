　　Changzhi Cooperative General Office Fully Serves Textile Industry
    [From Our Correspondent in Changzhi] The Lu'an Cooperative General Office is fully committed to serving the textile industry and actively promoting a self-sufficiency movement in homespun cloth. According to Comrade Wang Bi, the business minister of the office, the office has supplied the following textile tools to various counties in the past month: 20 cotton fluffs, 200,500 steel needles (each thousand costing 8,000 yuan less than the market price), 210 bamboo pillars, and over 10,000 jin of cotton were allocated. To solve the difficulty in supplying tools, the office is purchasing from other regions through various connections. For example, last winter, people were sent to Xingtai and Hengshui to buy cotton, but they did not succeed. Finally, seven peddlers who traveled to Xinxiang and Anyang were contacted to purchase a large number of cotton pillars. In order to reduce the price of tools, more than a dozen skilled workers have recently been invited from Xingtai to prepare for the establishment of a tool factory to manufacture cotton fluffs, cotton gins, etc. Some areas felt that yarn could not be turned into cloth, so the office is responsible for the mutual exchange of cotton, cloth, and yarn. Recently, 1,200 jin of yarn were transferred from Huguan to Lucheng. In addition, local handmade shuttles were purchased and sold to areas without shuttles. At present, six cadres have been dispatched to various counties to investigate and help strengthen the role of cooperatives in the textile movement in order to promote the entire textile movement.

　　长治合作总社全力服务纺织
    【本报长治讯】潞安合作总社全力为纺织服务，积极开展土布自给运动。据该社业务部长王碧同志称，近一月内该社对各县纺织工具的供给：计有风弓廿架，钢针廿万零五百根（每千根低于市价八千元），竹柱二百一十根，调剂棉花万余斤。该社为解决工具供应困难，通过各种关系向外区采购。如去冬派人至邢台、衡水买棉，没有买到，乃拉通七个走新乡、安阳的小贩才购到大批棉柱。为减低工具价格，近复由邢台请来十多个技术工人筹办工具厂，自造弹花风弓，轧花车等。部分地区感到有线变不成布，该社即负责花、布、线的相互兑换，最近又从壶关给潞城调剂线一千二百斤，此外又采购本区自造土梭向无梭地区出售。目前并抽派干部六人分赴各县调查，帮助加强合作社在纺织运动中的作用，以推进整个纺织运动。（行夫、右勤）
