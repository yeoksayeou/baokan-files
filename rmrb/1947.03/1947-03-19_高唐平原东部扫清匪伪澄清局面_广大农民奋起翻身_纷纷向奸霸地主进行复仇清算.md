[This report from our Jinnan office on the 17th] In the eastern Gaotang Plain on the Jinnan border, after sweeping away the remnants of Chiang's special agents, puppet bandits, and clarifying the situation, the broad masses of peasants have launched a large-scale movement to turn the tables for the first time. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the peasants in this area suffered immensely under the bloody rule of Japanese invaders, traitors, puppets, Chiang's special agents, and feudal landlords. After the Japanese surrender, Chiang Kai-shek instructed the local puppet bandits, secret agents, and landlords to continue to massacre and plunder the masses. The local democratic government, under the slogan of "holding a gun in one hand and turning the tables in the other," led the peasants in armed struggle and promoted land reform. However, due to the activities of the puppet bandits, our work fluctuated and could not develop in a balanced manner. Last month, after the Eighth Route Army, in coordination with the local peasants, thoroughly defeated the forces of Chiang's special agents and puppet bandits, many puppet bandit soldiers dispersed and returned home, hiding in the countryside and carrying out sabotage activities. The Party, government, army, and people of Gaotang and Pingyuan immediately organized forces to simultaneously suppress the puppet bandits, call on puppet bandit personnel to repent and surrender, and mobilize the peasants to promote land reform. More than sixty puppet bandit soldiers in Pingyuan have already repented to the government, surrendering one machine gun and more than one hundred long and short guns. After Li Xingtian from Lizhuang in the Fourth District returned home from being a puppet bandit, the government conducted three education sessions with his family, finally winning him over to repent and start anew. Influenced by this event, many puppet bandit personnel in the eastern part of the district are now repenting to the government. In Gaotang, moved by the repeated suppression and lenient policies of the county brigade and the Public Security Bureau, more than two hundred puppet bandits from the Second, Third, and Seventh Districts each repented, more than one hundred from the Eighth District repented, and eighty from the Fourth and Sixth Districts each repented, surrendering a total of six machine guns, one hundred and sixty-two rifles, eighteen Mauser pistols, four handguns, and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. Due to the sweeping of puppet bandits and the clarification of the situation, the broad masses of peasants, in order to seek justice and revenge, have enthusiastically launched a high tide of struggle. Five hundred peasants in Dongguan, Pingyuan, took the lead in settling accounts with the traitorous tyrant Jin Yuan, who had relied on his nephew being a puppet district chief to force two people to death. After reasoning and complaining, hundreds of peasants paraded in protest. The fire of anti-traitorous and vengeful revenge in the Pingdong area is spreading comprehensively. Gaotang is also seizing the opportunity to carry out land reform. In villages where the masses have not been mobilized, peasants are being mobilized to thoroughly settle accounts with the landlords and local bullies who have colluded with the enemy, puppets, bandits, and special agents to bloodily oppress the masses for the past nine years. In areas where the masses have been mobilized, a general review of the turn-over is being conducted.

　　高唐平原东部扫清匪伪澄清局面
    广大农民奋起翻身
    纷纷向奸霸地主进行复仇清算
    【本报冀南十七日电】冀南边沿高（唐）平（原）东部扫荡蒋特伪匪残余，澄清局面，广大农民首次掀起大规模翻身热潮。抗战八年中该地农民在日寇、奸伪、蒋特、封建地主血腥统治下，生活万分痛苦。日寇投降后，蒋介石指令该地伪匪、特务、地主，继续残杀掠夺群众。当地民主政府曾在“一手拿枪、一面闹翻身”口号下，领导农民，进行武装斗争和推进土地改革，终因伪匪之活动，使我方工作此起彼伏，不能平衡发展。上月八路军配合当地农民，彻底击溃蒋特伪匪力量后，有很多伪匪士兵溃散回家，隐蔽农村，进行破坏活动。高、平党政军民，随即组织力量，一面清剿伪匪，号召伪匪人员悔过自首；一面发动农民，推动土地改革。平原已有六十余名伪匪士兵向政府悔过，缴出机枪一挺、长短枪百余支。四区李庄李兴田从伪匪回家后，政府曾向其家属进行三次教育，终于争取李兴田悔过自新。在这一事件影响下，该区东部很多伪匪人员，现正纷纷向政府悔过。高唐在县大队、公安局反复清剿及宽大政策感动下，二、三、七区各有二百人以上伪匪悔过，八区有百余人悔过，四、六区各有八十余人悔过，共计缴出机枪六挺、步枪一百六十二支、匣枪十八支、手枪四支，子弹千余发。由于扫荡伪匪、澄清局面，广大农民为申冤复仇，热烈掀起斗争高潮。平原东关五百农民，首起清算汉奸恶霸金元，他曾仗其外甥当伪区长，逼死两条人命；当说理诉苦后，数百农民游行示威。平东地区反奸复仇怒火，正向全面开展。高唐亦在抓紧时机进行土地改革。在群众未发动过的村庄，发动农民向九年来勾结敌伪匪特血腥压榨群众的地主恶霸，进行彻底清算。在群众发动过的地区，普遍进行翻身大检查。
