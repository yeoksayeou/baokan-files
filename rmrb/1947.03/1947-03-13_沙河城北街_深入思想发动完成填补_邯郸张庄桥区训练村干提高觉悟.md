Shāhé City North Street
    Thorough Ideological Mobilization Completes Land Redistribution
    Hándān Zhāngzhuāngqiáo District Trains Village Cadres to Raise Awareness
    [Report from this newspaper in Shāhé] This county's North Street, Shāhé City, broke the "things will change" mentality through thorough ideological mobilization, achieving complete land redistribution. The mass movement in this street, after a major development phase last winter, overthrew 37 despotic landlords, special agents, and landlords. However, due to the lack of organized in-depth accusation meetings and ideological mobilization, many people still harbored worries about a change in government. Most of the more than 200 households lacking land and housing dared not boldly demand houses and land, failing to report problems and affecting the completion of land redistribution. Some backward farmers even felt it was "wrong" to divide the landlord's houses and land. For example, Fán Èrgǎi míng said: "Although our house is very dilapidated, it was built by ourselves; the Fán family's descendants do not leave the Fán family's door!" Some small landlords and feudal rich peasants pretended to be poor peasants, attempting to swindle the fruits of the mass struggle. After review, the leadership clarified that "without good mass mobilization, it is difficult to truly complete land redistribution." Therefore, they further mobilized the masses ideologically to separate from the landlords. Fán Èrgǎi míng recalled that he used to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord Chén Lǎobìng, producing ten bags of grain and five bags of wheat a year, while he himself only got five bags of wheat for food and wages. He said angrily: "No wonder the Chén family acquired estates and fields; he exploited ten bags of grain from me alone every year, this house and land are all mine!" Many poor peasants recalled that they were so exploited in the past that they were ruined and lived in temples begging for food, and they were determined to reclaim their houses and land. The landlord's high-interest loans forced the middle peasant Hú Shìchūn to sell all his houses and land, and his donkey starved to death. Some middle peasants complained about the plight of not even being able to afford a wife. At this point, the poor peasants and middle peasants united to accuse the landlord's crimes, breaking the silent situation of fearing to offend people and fearing a change in government. Afterwards, through comparing past suffering, the masses' enthusiasm for demanding houses and land was extremely high, and the land redistribution work was completed smoothly and reasonably.

    [Report from this newspaper in Hándān] In the land redistribution movement, in order to raise the masses' class consciousness and completely eliminate feudalism, Zhāngzhuāngqiáo District specially held a training class for village cadres and activists from February 12th to 22nd, and discovered the following problems: (1) Feudal forces threaten the masses. The local tyrant Zhào Tíngzhēn from Guōjiāzhuāng usurped the position of chairman of the farmers' association, sheltering landlords. At the meeting to struggle against the landlord Kāng Tóng in the village last year, Zhào Tíngzhēn openly threatened the masses, saying: "If someone from the district comes, whoever makes suggestions will be thrown into the river!" Last year, the district sent someone to work in the village, and only then did they discover the problems in the village. (2) Cadres have a complacent "good enough" mentality, hindering the deepening of the movement. Cadres from villages such as Dōngxiǎotūn and Běizhāngzhuāng believe that the landlords have already been "defeated" and "do not need" to be struggled against anymore. However, after enlightening discussion, they began to realize that the landlord Wáng Wényì in Běizhāngzhuāng still had 50 mu of irrigated land, and another 18 landlords needed to be re-struggled against. (3) The cadres' work style is not good, and the landlords take the opportunity to provoke discord. Sòng Jīntáng, the public security officer of Liǔlínqiáo, confessed that five cadres in his village competed with each other for power and profit and attacked each other when dividing the fruits, allowing the landlords to take advantage of the situation. (4) "Backward" elements hide things for the landlords. Forty cadres, militiamen, and activists in Zhāngzhuāngqiáo village confessed that they had buried things for the landlords in the past, used the landlords' money, wrote documents for the landlords that they would not be struggled against, and protected the landlords by using conciliatory methods during the struggle, etc. After ten days of deep reflection and the leadership's enlightening education, everyone's awareness was generally improved, and they were prepared to return to the village to thoroughly carry out the struggle.

　　沙河城北街
    深入思想发动完成填补
    邯郸张庄桥区训练村干提高觉悟
    【本报沙河讯】本县城北街以深入思想发动打破变天思想，达到填平补齐。该街群运在去冬经过大发展阶段，斗倒三十七户恶霸特务地主，但因没有组织深入诉苦与思想发动，许多群众仍有变天顾虑。二百多户缺地缺房的农民，大部不敢大胆要房要地，有坑不报、影响填平补齐。有些落后农民甚至觉得分地主房地“亏心”。如樊二改明说：“虽然我们房子很破，可是自己盖的，樊家子弟不出樊家门！”若干小地主及封建富农却假装贫苦农民，企图骗取群众斗争果实。领导上经过检讨，明确了“群众发动不好，即难真正填平补齐”，于是进一步从思想上发动群众与地主分家。樊二改明回忆到自已过去给地主陈老并当长工一年能产十袋谷、五袋麦，而自己连吃带赚只得五袋麦时，他愤恨的说：“难怪陈家置庄置田；他一年从我一个人身上剥削十袋谷，这房地都是我的呀！”许多贫农回忆到过去被剥削得倾家荡产，住庙讨饭，都坚决要索回自己房地。中农胡是春被地主高利贷逼得房地卖净，饿死驴子。有的中农诉说自己连老婆都娶不起的窘困生活。至此，贫农与中农联合起来控诉地主罪恶，打破了怕惹人、怕变天的沈闷局面。以后经过比时光、比坑，群众要房要地的情绪极高，填补工作得以顺利的合理完成。（沙河公安局）
    【本报邯郸讯】张庄桥区在填补运动中，为提高群众阶级觉悟，彻底消灭封建，特于二月十二至二十二日，举办村干和积极分子训练班，发现以下几个问题：（一）封建势力威胁群众。郭家庄恶霸赵庭珍窃据农会主任职位，掩护地主，去年该村斗争地主康桐的大会上，赵庭珍公开威胁群众说：“要是区上有人来，谁提意见，就把谁扔到河里！”去年区上曾派人至该村工作，始发现该村问题。（二）干部有“差不多”的自满思想，阻碍运动深入。东小屯、北张庄等村干部认为地主已经“打垮”了，“不需要”再斗争了。但经过启发讨论，始查觉北张庄地主王文义尚有水浇地五十亩，另有十八家地主需要重新斗争。（三）干部作风不好，地主乘机挑拨。柳林桥公安员宋金堂坦白出他村五个干部在分果实时，彼此争权夺利互相攻击，让地主钻了空子。（四）“落后”分子为地主隐藏东西。张庄桥村四十个干部、民兵、积极分子检讨出过去替地主埋藏东西，使用地主的钱，给地主立不斗争文书，斗争时用和解的方式包庇地主等等。经过十天的深刻反省与领导上的启发教育，大家觉悟普遍提高，准备回村彻底斗争。（赵寒）
