Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the Situation in Central Jiangsu in February

[Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th] A reporter from the Central Jiangsu Branch of Xinhua News Agency recently analyzed the situation on the Central Jiangsu guerrilla battlefield in February, stating:

(1) In February, the military and civilians of Central Jiangsu launched over 1,100 proactive attacks, annihilating more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, capturing 58 strongholds, recovering vast amounts of lost territory, and smashing Chiang's "encirclement and suppression" plan, comprehensively gaining the initiative. In the past month, due to the emptiness of their forces, Chiang's troops concentrated on "encirclement and suppression" in areas on both sides of the Ru (Gao) Jue (Gang) and Ru (Gao) Huang (Qiao) lines, and intensified their complete blockade from Xuzhou to Haian, detouring to Juegang, attempting to cut off our north-south connection. However, the military and civilians of Central Jiangsu preemptively struck, launching the Chenzao battle on January 31, annihilating four companies of Chiang's troops in one fell swoop; on February 9, they launched the Pin (Tu) Bei battle, forcing the 79th Brigade of the reorganized 49th Division of Chiang's troops, who were "encircling and suppressing" Ru (Gao) Dong, to come to their aid. With the Chiang's troops along the Ru (Gao) Jue (Gang) line weakened, the military and civilians of Rudong took the opportunity to launch a comprehensive counterattack, restoring more than 20 strongholds such as Yanzhuang, Zhouzhuang, and Shixiang, and liberating large areas south of the Ruhuang line. Chiang's troops had no choice but to return to Rudong, and our army then expanded the Pin (Tu) Bei offensive on the 15th, attacking Jiaoxie and other places. The 79th Brigade of the Rujue line and the 315th Regiment of the 105th Brigade of the 19th Division, who were "encircling and suppressing" both sides of the Ruhuang line, had to come to support Rugao again, and their "encirclement and suppression" troops were completely caught in extreme panic and were exhausted. At the same time, the military and civilians of Xinghua, Qintong, Gaoyou, and Baoying proactively launched attacks, smashing Chiang's troops' three "sweeps," recovering more than ten strongholds, and destroying the Chiang regime in 49 townships. In the difficult environment of Chiang's troops' strongholds, the military and civilians of Nantong fought bravely and recovered many strongholds, opening up the war situation in the area. The Chiang's troops of Hai (Men) Qi (Dong) "encircled and suppressed" for more than a month, occupying less than ten strongholds, and more than 130 towns were still in the hands of the people. Chiang's troops were squeezed onto the Ruhuang, Rujue, and Tongyu communication lines, and their "encirclement and suppression" plan was completely shattered. The rapid expansion of guerrilla areas and the passive position of "encirclers and suppressors" is a major change in the situation between the enemy and us since the Self-Defense War, and will be further developed in the future.

(2) Under the influence of the comprehensive counterattack and victories everywhere by the people's armed forces, Chiang's troops and their henchmen were extremely panicked, and a large number of them fled. In the Jiang (Yan) Qu (Tang) Hai (An) line, under the Chiang's 49th Division, more than 200 people fled in just a few days, of which more than 120 defected to the People's Liberation Army. By the end of February, the number of "Homecoming Legions" and Chiang's regime personnel who fled or reformed had reached more than 2,500. Even Yang @, the Chiang-appointed Nantong County Magistrate, absconded with public funds because he saw no hope in opposing the Communist Party. The Chiang's personnel trapped in various strongholds were in a state of panic, alarmed several times a day.

(3) The masses' fighting spirit is unprecedentedly high, and the mass self-defense movement is developing vigorously; the scale is unprecedented since the Self-Defense War. When Zhouzhuang, Rugao, was recovered, more than 10,000 people automatically helped the army to level Chiang's bunkers and fortifications. More than 60,000 people participated in sabotage during the anti-"encirclement and suppression" in Rudong, and more than 30,000 people cooperated with more than 100 joint defense teams to harass and attack the enemy in turn. During the anti-"encirclement and suppression" in Haiqi, 100,000 people participated in sabotage, making it impossible for Chiang's troops to open the Haiqi Highway to this day. The included classes are even more extensive, and all men, women, old and young, including enlightened landlords, have been involved in the struggle. This is the basic factor for achieving victory, and it has laid a solid foundation for the continued victory of the struggle in the future.

　　苏中我全面取得主动敌极度恐惶疲于奔命
    新华社记者评二月份苏中形势
    【新华社华中十一日电】苏中分社记者顷分析二月份苏中游击战场形势称：
    （一）苏中军民二月以主动出击一千一百余次，歼灭蒋伪军三千余人，攻克据点五十八处，收复广大失地，粉碎了蒋军“清剿”计划，全面取得主动。一月来蒋军由于兵力空虚，乃集中“清剿”如（皋）掘（港）、如（皋）黄（桥）线两侧地区，并加紧其自徐州经海安迂回掘港之全线封锁，企图切断我南北联系。但苏中军民先发制人，于一月三十一日进行沉灶战斗，一举歼灭蒋军四个连；二月九日复发动拼（荼）北战斗，迫使“清剿”如（皋）东之蒋军整编四十九师七十九旅来援。如（皋）掘（港）线蒋军兵力空虚，如东军民即乘隙展开全面反击，恢复燕庄、周庄、实巷等二十余据点，解放如黄线以南大块地区。蒋军不得不回师如东，我军乃于十五日扩展拼（荼）北攻势，进击角斜等地，如掘线七十九旅及“清剿”如黄线两侧之十九师一○五旅三一五团又只得前来支援如皋，其“清剿”部队完全陷于极度慌乱与疲于奔命。与此同时，兴化、溱潼、高邮、宝应军民主动出击，粉碎蒋军三次“扫荡”，收复十余据点、摧毁四十九个乡的蒋政权。南通军民在蒋军据点林立艰苦环境中，奋勇出击，亦收复据点多处，打开该地战争局面。海（门）启（东）蒋军“清剿”月余，只占领不到十个据点，一百三十余市镇仍在人民手中。蒋军被压挤到如黄、如掘、通榆等交通线上，其“清剿”计划全盘粉碎。游击地区之猛烈扩大与“清剿”者已处于被动，这是自卫战争以来蒋后敌我形势的一个大变化，今后将更加开展。
    （二）在人民武装全面反击到处胜利的影响下，蒋军及其爪牙极度恐慌，大批逃亡。蒋军四十九师所部在姜（堰）曲（塘）海（安）一线上，仅数天中就逃亡二百余人，其中百二十余名投奔解放军。而“还乡团”及蒋政权人员的逃亡或自新的数目，迄二月底止已达二千五百余人。连蒋记南通县长杨＠亦因反共无望卷款潜逃。困守各据点的蒋方人员陷入风声鹤唳，一日数惊。
    （三）群众斗争情绪空前高涨，群众性自卫运动猛烈展开；其规模之大，为自卫战争以来所未有。收复如皋周庄时，一万多群众自动帮助军队平毁蒋军碉堡工事，如东反“清剿”中六万多人参加破击，三万多人配合一百多联防队轮番困扰击敌。海启反“清剿”中，有十万群众参加破击，使蒋军至今无法打通海启公路。而包括的阶层更为广泛，所有男女老少，包括开明地主在内，都卷入了斗争。取得胜利的基本因素，而且为今后斗争继续胜利奠下了深厚的基础。
