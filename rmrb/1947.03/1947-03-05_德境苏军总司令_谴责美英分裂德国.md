　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: A delayed dispatch from Berlin: On February 25th, Soviet Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Sokolovsky, made an important statement in the German Control Council, condemning the economic merger agreement of the US and British occupation zones in Germany, which was not approved by the Control Council and violated the principle of unified action in joint work. Sokolovsky stated that this merger did not take the implementation of the Potsdam Conference's policy of eliminating Germany's war industry potential, paying reparations, or eliminating the economic foundation of fascism in western Germany as its immediate or secondary goal. The merger agreement stipulates that the US and British occupation zones trade only with Western countries, completely ignoring the issue of developing trade relations between the occupation zones. The rest of Germany is treated as foreign territory, which clearly leads Germany towards final division. Sokolovsky questioned whether the purpose of the merger was to exploit the German economy through occupation, making it subordinate to US and British monopolies, and to abolish German independence, making western Germany a subsidiary of foreign monopolies? Sokolovsky also stated that administrative and territorial reorganizations, as well as mergers of provinces and states, are now being hastily carried out in the western region, which is puzzling. Sokolovsky concluded by saying that the Soviet side will continue to strive to maintain the Potsdam principles as its responsibility, and he is convinced that, facing the difficulties of the Control Council, it is entirely possible to resolve them in accordance with the policy lines agreed upon by the Allied countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: TASS, Washington, February 28th: US Democratic Congressman Shadroske of Missouri announced that he had submitted a statement to US representative to the Moscow Conference, Cohen, urging the US delegation to support the current German-Polish border as determined at the Potsdam Conference. He said: In all respects, the Potsdam decision on the Polish border is correct, and any violation of this policy will be detrimental to the cause of world peace.

　　德境苏军总司令
    谴责美英分裂德国
    【新华社延安三日电】柏林迟到消息：二月二十五日德境苏军总司令索科洛夫斯基在德国管制委员会中发表重要声明，谴责德境美英占领区之经济合并协定并未经管委会之准许，违反了共同工作中一致行动的原则。索氏称：这一合并并未将实行波茨顿会议关于清除德国战争工业潜在力，偿付、赔偿或消灭德国西部法西斯经济基础的政策作为其立即或第二步的目标。合并协定确定了美英占领区仅与西方国家贸易，而完全忽视发展各占领区间之贸易关系问题。德国的其余部分都被当作外国领土，这明显的是使德国走向最后的分裂。索氏质问：是否合并的目的在于利用占领以榨取德国经济，使其附属于美英的独占；并取消德国的独立而使西部德国成为外国独占的附属品？索氏又称：在西部地区现在又急忙的在进行行政与领土的改组，省与邦的合并，这是令人奇怪的。索氏末称：苏联方面以继续努力保持波茨顿原则为已责，他确信面对管委会的困难，依照盟国已协议的政策路线是完全可以解决的。
    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社华盛顿二十八日电：美密苏里州民主党众议员沙多斯克宣称，他已向美出席莫斯科会议代表科亨提出声明一件，敦促美国代表团支持波茨顿会议上所确定的目前德波边界。他说：从各方面说，波茨顿关于波兰边界的决定都是正确的，任何违背这一政策必将有害于世界和平事业。
