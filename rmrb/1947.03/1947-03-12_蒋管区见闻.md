　　Sights and Sounds from the Chiang-Controlled Areas
    Zhang Zhihan
    When our troops entered the vicinity of Tuocheng, the masses there treated the Eighth Route Army like their own brothers, telling us everything. On January 30th, we stayed in Niudoucheng Village, fifteen miles north of the city. During a break, I talked to some villagers. Near the village, we met two young men collecting manure. As soon as they saw us, they said happily, "Now that you're here, we can't survive here anymore!" Then he began to complain, saying, "Last year, I produced thirty-five catties of wheat per mu, plus a hundred yuan in taxes, and several big trees were cut down; those that weren't cut were marked, and they had to be given to people whenever they wanted them. If you can't pay the grain taxes, they will seize your land. After they seize your land, they will rent it back to you. After you harvest the wheat each year, you can only keep the straw; the grain all belongs to them. The burdens are borne by middle-income and poor households. People with money and labor, and those who have connections with the government, don't have to pay. They arrest young people whenever they see them. Seven or eight people have been arrested from our small village of twenty or so families. As soon as they catch you, they twist your hands behind your back, tie them with a small rope, and drag you away. Once you get to the city, they take off your cotton clothes, put on military uniforms, and you become their soldiers. If you want to come back, you have to pay at least 300,000 yuan. If you get caught again, you're out of luck." Then they said excitedly, "We are relieved now that you are here. You can give the people a chance to vent their anger. As long as your guns fire, I guarantee Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers won't fight, because the soldiers all hate their officers." There was a peasant who broke through the city wall in the west of Zhecheng. He was very active in his work. I asked him why he was so happy. He said, "Comrade, look at my hands." His two hands were missing the index and middle fingers. It turned out that in order to avoid being caught and forced into the army, he endured the pain and cut off his own fingers. He said that now that the city walls were broken, the bastards could no longer stay safely in the city and harm the people.

　　蒋管区见闻
    张之韩
    当我们部队进到拓城附近时，那里群众见了八路军，好像亲兄弟一样，无话不说。一月三十日我们住在城北十五里牛斗城村，趁休息的空隙找了几个老乡谈心，在村旁遇着两个拾粪的青年，一见面就很高兴的说：“你们走啦，这里不能活了！”接着他便诉起苦来，他说：“我去年每亩地出了三十五斤麦子，还有一百元款，几颗大树也砍光了；没砍的也都号上了，啥时要就得啥时给人家。粮款出不起就扣地，把地扣去又租给你，每年的麦子收下后，你光留下麦秆，粮食都是人家的。负担都是中等户及贫苦户出，有钱有劳力的人和官府有关系的人都不出。碰到青年就抓，我们二十来家的小村子被抓去有七八个了，只要捉住你两手向后一扭，小绳一捆，拉着就走，到了城里把棉衣一脱，换上军衣，就成了他们的兵。如果你想回来，至少出三十万元，下次再抓到就活该倒霉。”接着他们兴奋的说：“你们一来我们就放心了，你们可给老百姓出口气吧，只要你们枪一响，保险蒋介石的兵不打，因为当兵的都恨他们当官的。”柘城西关有个破城的农民，工作很积极，我问他为什么那样高兴，他说：“同志，你看我的手。”他的两手没有了二指及中指，原来为了逃避被捉当兵，他忍着痛把自己的手指砍去了，他说破了城墙，王八蛋们再也不能安稳驻在城里遭害老百姓了。
