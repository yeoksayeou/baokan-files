　　Shi Zhenming of the Joint Mutual Aid Zhenxi Brigade, after the liquidation of feudal remnants, the emancipated peasants are enthusiastically preparing for the great production movement. Recently, the entire village's spring plowing plan was announced, mainly including the following items: (1) 100% organization, implementing intensive cultivation, improving soil, and increasing coarse grain yield by one dou per mu. (2) Increase two new canals, maintain moisture in the river management area, and expand cultivated land area. (3) Implement early plowing; land not plowed last period must be plowed twice. (4) Implement large-scale labor exchange between "cattle shortage" in Tianhe and "labor shortage" in mountain gullies. (5) Combine difference tickets and work tickets for equivalent exchange, and prioritize plowing and sowing for those participating in the war effort. (6) Achieve self-sufficiency in grain and cotton. Plant 40 mu of grain and 100 mu of cotton. (7) Absorb liquidated landlords to participate in labor mutual aid, follow Zhang Yongtai's path, and resolve their difficulties. After these plans were announced, the masses greatly supported them. Each mutual aid group held family meetings to formulate plans for prosperity. Labor hero Zhao Rongzhi has already prepared his plan for prosperity. The entire village's spring plowing preparations are unfolding enthusiastically. Of the 150,000 dan of manure, 80,000 dan have already been delivered to the fields, along with 30,000 jin of firewood and 3,000 jin of coal. They used accounting methods to conclude that burning coal can save labor, and it is now being greatly promoted. According to a seven-person household using one labor unit to collect firewood, approximately 120 jin can be burned for three days; burning coal requires two labor units to carry over 70 jin of coal, with a coal price of one sheng of rice, which can be burned for ten days. Women burning firewood to cook can spin one liang of cotton per day; burning coal can spin two liang of cotton. A cooperative jointly invested by the masses of the villages of Tiantou and Fancun also provided 30 shi of millet to help emancipated peasants in production, and also custom-made various agricultural tools for the peasants at low prices.

    组织全部劳力  实行精耕细作
    【本报太岳一日电】石振明联合互助镇西大队，查封建尾巴结束后，翻身农民热情勃勃准备大生产运动。最近宣布全村春耕计划，主要有以下几项：（一）百分之百组织起来，实行精耕细作，改良土壤，每亩增加粗粮一斗。（二）增开新渠两条，治河地区保湿，扩大耕地面积。（三）实行早犁，去年未期土地一律犁两遍。（四）天河“缺牛”与山沟“缺人”实行大变工。（五）差票与工票结合等价交换，尽先给参战群众犁种。（六）粮、棉做到自给自足。种粮四十亩，种棉一百亩。（七）吸收被清算雇主参加劳动互助，走张永泰道路，并解决其困难，这些计划公布之后，群众很拥护，各互助组召开家庭会议，制定发家计划。劳动英雄赵荣智，已经把发家计划制好，全村的春耕准备热火朝天的展开，十五万担粪，已有八万担送到地里，打柴三万斤，担煤三千斤。他们用算账办法得出烧煤可以省工，现正大大提倡。按七口人家用一个工打柴，约一百二十斤，可以烧三天；烧煤用两个工，担煤七十多斤，煤价米一升，可以烧十天。妇女烧柴做饭，每天可纺花一两；烧煤可纺花二两。填头、范村两村群众投资合办的一个合作社，也拿三十石小米，帮助翻身农民生产，并给农民低价定制各种农具。
