Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th. People from all walks of life in Songjiang Province and Harbin City held a grand rally at Zhaolin Park in Harbin at 10:00 AM yesterday to celebrate the great victory in Southern Songjiang and welcome the more than 5,000 captured Chiang Kai-shek army officers and soldiers who arrived here the day before yesterday. In the evening, several evening parties were held to entertain them. After arriving here, they were housed in specially prepared heated reception centers, provided with fine grains, and given cigarettes and food. Visiting delegations from all walks of life went to express their regards throughout the day. This morning, representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek army officers and soldiers will hold forums with students, workers, shop assistants, and people from all walks of life in Harbin.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th. Recently, a reporter interviewed Zeng Qi, head of the 19th Regiment of the New 30th Division of the New First Army of the Chiang Kai-shek army, who laid down his arms in the Battle of Chengzijie last month, in a certain place. Zeng said when talking about the reasons for the failure of his unit: "You (referring to the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, the same below) were completely active, and we (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek army, the same below) were completely passive. Our forces were scattered, and what we occupied were points and lines, making it impossible to concentrate, resulting in loopholes everywhere and beatings everywhere. None of the five armies (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek army) in the Northeast is not being beaten or suffering losses." Zeng said: The old soldiers are unwilling to fight, and the newly recruited soldiers who are forcibly conscripted are even less trained. I am also very tired of the civil war. I am 42 years old and have reached the age of retirement, but my repeated requests have never been answered. I hope that peace will be realized as soon as possible, so that I can be an innocent commoner. When the regiment was destroyed, Zeng disguised himself as a soldier and hid among the soldiers, changing his name to Wang Shunfu, claiming to be a clerk in the company headquarters, but was eventually discovered.

    哈尔滨市各界庆祝松南大捷
    【新华社东北二十五日电】松江省及哈尔滨市各界人士于昨日上午十时在哈市兆麟公园举行庆祝松南大捷大会，并欢迎前日抵此之五千余被俘蒋军官兵，入晚并有数处晚会招待。彼等抵此后，即住入特备暖气的招待所，拨以细粮，并分赠香烟、食品，各界访问团终日络绎前往慰问，今日上午蒋军官兵代表将分别与哈市学生、工人、店员、各界举行座谈。
    【新华社东北二十五日电】记者日前于某地访问上月下旬在城子街战斗中放下武器的蒋军新一军新三十师十九团长曾琪。曾氏谈及该部失败原因时称：“你们（指东北民主联军，下同）完全主动，我们（指蒋军，下同）完全处于被动，兵力分散，所占的都是点线，无法集中，以致到处是漏洞，到处挨打，现在东北的五个军（指蒋军）没有一个不挨打不受到损失的。”曾氏表示：老兵都不愿打仗，强抓来的新兵更无训练，我对内战也十分厌烦了，我现年四十二岁，已届退伍年龄，但屡次要求从未获覆。但愿和平早日实现，做一个清白老百姓。曾氏于该团覆没时曾改装士兵藏于士兵群中，改名王顺甫，自称系连部文书，复终被查获。
