Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 18th: Moscow dispatch: The Council of Foreign Ministers Assistants' meeting on Germany continued its discussion on March 17th regarding the preparatory procedures for a German peace treaty. During the discussion on the composition of the Intelligence Advisory Committee, U.S. representative Murphy proposed inviting not only Allied nations neighboring Germany or those with armed forces participating in the war against Germany but also all nations that had declared war on Germany. Murphy's suggestion was opposed by French representative Chauvel and also by Soviet representative Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky stated that while democratic countries were engaged in arduous combat against Fascism, some countries, though formally severing relations with Hitler's Germany, preferred to stand idly by. Vyshinsky pointed to the example of Turkey, which only mustered the courage to declare war on Germany on April 26, 1945, while Germany surrendered on May 9th; this example is highly instructive. Vyshinsky continued: Of course, there could be some exceptions regarding countries that provided actual assistance in the war against Germany, such as Iran's war efforts, which were recognized in a special declaration by the three leaders. However, this does not mean that the basic principle can be violated; such countries can be invited, but with reservations, that is, such invitations should be regarded as exceptions. Vyshinsky believed that the representatives of former German satellite states, which later switched to the Allied side and participated in the fight against Fascism, should also have the opportunity to express their opinions during certain stages of the preparation of the treaty, such as Romania, which sent eighteen divisions to fight against Germany and Bulgaria. Italy also played some limited role in the war against Germany. By this point, the participants generally agreed in principle with Vyshinsky's suggestion, but decided that the list of countries participating in the work of the Intelligence Advisory Committee would be drawn up when the entire treaty preparation process was adopted. The meeting then discussed the composition of the permanent committees of the Council of Foreign Ministers on various issues related to the German peace treaty. This issue had been agreed upon in principle at the London Conference. The French delegation had proposed the establishment of four committees: a committee to deal with the political and constitutional composition of Germany, a committee to deal with territorial changes and related issues, a committee to deal with the economic organization of Germany and reparations issues, and a committee to deal with disarmament and demilitarization. The London Conference had also suggested the establishment of necessary subcommittees. At the meeting on the 15th, British representative Strang's proposal overturned the already established procedure for drafting the treaty and violated the responsibility of the Council of Foreign Ministers to draft the German peace treaty as determined by the Berlin Agreement. Strang suggested that the chairman of the committee should not necessarily be a representative of the Four Powers, as stipulated in the French plan, but that any representative of the Allied nations could serve. Vyshinsky explained that the procedure proposed by the British delegation was designed from the outset to ensure the complete failure of the work of drafting the treaty. Vyshinsky stated: The permanent committees and subcommittees are working bodies, and they want to turn these bodies into discussion clubs. Strang evaded discussion of the substance of the issue and merely claimed that his suggestion was that the permanent committee should not include all the Allied nations, but only nineteen countries would participate. The discussion of this issue will continue at the next meeting.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 18th: United Press reported: General Clay, the new governor of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany and commander of the occupation forces, arrived in Moscow on the afternoon of the 17th from Berlin at Marshall's summons.

    情报咨询委员会参与国对德外长助理会获协议
    【新华社延安十八日电】莫斯科讯：三月十七日对德外长助理会议继续讨论对德和约的准备程序，在讨论到情报咨询委会之组成时，美代表墨菲提议不仅邀请邻近德国之盟国或有武装力量参加对德作战之国家，而且邀请对德宣战之各国参加，墨菲之建议受到法代表摩维尔之反对，亦受到苏代表维辛斯基之反对。维氏称：当民主国家对法西斯主义进行艰苦作战之时，某些国家虽已正式与希特勒德国断绝关系，但宁愿袖手旁观。维氏指陈不能忘记土耳其的例子，土耳其于一九四五年四月二十六日才鼓起勇气对德宣战，而五月九日德国即投降了；这个例子极有启示性。维氏继称：关于在对德国作战中作了实际援助的各国当然也能有些例外，例如像伊朗的作战努力，在三国领袖的特别宣言中即曾受重视，但是这不是说可以违背基本原则，这种国家可以受邀请，但应附有保留，即这种邀请应作为例外。维氏认为也应该考虑前德国附庸国，但后来转入盟国方面并参加了对法西斯主义作战之国家的代表，在准备和约的某些阶段中有机会陈述意见，例如像罗马尼亚这个国家，曾派出十八个师对德国和保加利亚作战，在对德作战中意大利也起了某些有限的作用。至此与会者在原则上均同意维辛斯基的建议，但又决定参加情报咨询会议工作的国家名单延至整个和约的准备程序通过时拟定。会议继而讨论外长会议关于对德和约中各种问题之永久委会的组成，这一问题在伦敦会议时曾在原则上达到协议，法代表团曾建议成立四个委会，即处理德国政治与宪法组成的委会、领土改变及与此有关问题的委会、处理德国经济组织与赔款问题的委会、及处理解除军备与废除军事化的委会，并且伦敦会议亦曾建议成立必要的小组委会。在十五日的会议上英代表斯特朗提出的建议推翻了业已确定的草拟和约的程序，并违反柏林协定所确定的外长会议草拟对德和约的责任；斯特朗建议委员会的主席不一定是四强的代表而有如法国计划所规定者，即盟国之任何代表均可充任。维辛斯基说明英代表团所建议之程序，从一开始就注意草拟和约之工作要完全失败。维氏称：永久委会与小组委会均系工作机关，而他们却要把这些机关变成讨论中的俱乐部。斯特朗回避讨论此问题之实质而仅声称他建议永久委会不包括全体盟国，只有十九个国家参加，此一问题之讨论将于下次会议中继续举行。
