    Struggle First, Distribute Benefits Later
    Wu Baojin and Li Zhonghua Honored as Model Cadres
    [This Dispatch from Zuoquan] Wu Baojin, the village chief of Yangjiao Village in the Fifth District of Zuoquan, and Li Zhonghua, the director of the Farmers' Association, have been gloriously elected as model workers in the emancipation movement for putting struggle first and distributing benefits later. The village's emancipation movement began last winter, and Wu and Li actively led the peasants in pouring out their grievances and organizing the struggle. For two months, they were constantly participating in plenary discussions or small group deliberations, finally completely crushing the village's feudal forces. Wu is a poor peasant. During the distribution of benefits, he received a donkey and 1.2 mu of good land, just enough to cultivate. He immediately gave his original 3 mu of land to a poor peasant working at the lime kiln. The masses believed that he and Farmers' Association Director Li Zhonghua had received too few benefits and decided to give each of them another robe. Wu refused, saying, "Today everyone is liberated; let's fill the holes first and then make things complete. Many worker brothers still haven't worn robes; let's give them to them!" The masses knew that his family lacked food, and they wanted to subsidize him with five dou of corn, but he refused again. He said, "The donkey I received has hauled six trips of coal, earning more than 6,000 yuan. With further production and farming, I won't have to worry about food!" The masses insisted on giving it to him, so he consulted with Li Zhonghua and persuaded the masses by reasoning with them. They said, "We received benefits in 1943, so we shouldn't be given anything this year. Having a donkey is better than grain." Their exemplary behavior educated the cadres who had incorrect emotions during the distribution of benefits, and three people voluntarily returned the benefits they had received excessively. The masses reflected, "You don't need many good cadres; one is worth ten." With the unanimous support of the entire village, the two have been gloriously elected as model workers in the village's emancipation movement.

    斗争在前分果实在后
    武保金李中华荣膺模范干部
    【本报左权讯】左权五区羊角村村长武保金、农会主任李中华，斗争在前，分果实在后，光荣当选为翻身运动中的模范工作者。该村翻身运动于去冬开始，武、李二人即积极领导农民诉苦，组织斗争。两月来无时不在参加大会讨论或小组酝酿，终于彻底摧垮了村中封建势力。武是贫农，分果实中，分了一头驴，一亩二分好地，刚够种，即将自己原来三亩地让给石灰窑的贫农种，群众认为他和农会主任李中华都得的果实太少，决定每人再分一件袍子。武不收，说：“今天大家翻身，先填窟窿后补齐，好多工人兄弟至今没穿过袍子，分给他们吧！”群众知他家里粮食不足，又以五斗玉茭补助他，同样遭到拒绝。他说：“我拿分的驴运了六趟煤，赚六千多元，今后再生产、种地，粮食就不愁啦！”群众坚决要给，他就和李中华商议，以算账方式劝阻群众，他们说：“我们四三年得了果实，今年就不该分啦，有驴就顶粮食了。”他们的模范行为教育了分果实时发生不正确情绪的干部，有三人自动退出多得的果实。群众反映说：“好干部不用多，一个顶十个。”在全村一致拥护下，二人已光荣当选为该村翻身运动中的模范工作者。
