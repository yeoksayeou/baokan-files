    Armed Turn-Over Teams Penetrate Villages;
    Border Area Joint Defense Distributes Land in Yuanqu
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in the Taiyue area, dated the 23rd] Yuanqu has corrected the thinking that "land reform cannot be carried out in border areas." The flames of struggle are sweeping across the county. Along the Jiang (County) Yuan (Qu) highway, which stretches for dozens of *li* from Gaoluo in the west to Yuanqu City in the east, the movement to return land to the peasants is unfolding amidst the sounds of gunfire. Land reform in Yuanqu had been affected by the war, and the mass movement had once stagnated. Since the county-wide cadre expansion meeting on February 17th, which mobilized people to hold a gun in one hand and distribute land in the other, the peasants in each village have launched a general liquidation movement to "sharpen their knives and chop down feudalism." Currently, the towns of Tongshan, Liucun, and Nanyan have realized "land to the tiller." More than 20 villages, including Zhucun, Chencun, Fengcun, and Songcun, are in the process of distributing the fruits [of the revolution], while villages such as Baishui, Changzhen, and Ducun are continuing their struggle against feudal forces amidst the sound of gunfire. The reasons for such resolute mass action in the border areas are:

    Important Experience

    First, armed forces guaranteed the land reform movement. The county established a unified land reform headquarters, organized "armed turn-over teams" with battalion soldiers, militia, and armed work teams as the backbone, and combined them with the command posts of various joint defense villages to penetrate the border villages. If the enemy did not come out, they would distribute land. If the enemy moved, they would conduct joint defense operations. They also combined the guard militia of various joint defense villages to launch offensives against enemy strongholds. There were battles every day on the Jiang (County) Yuan (Qu) highway for twenty days. On February 26, when the enemy from Gaoluo advanced towards our Changzhi Village, the "armed turn-over team" combined with the militia to ambush them in Yuanyu Village. The masses of Huoxing Village, which belongs to Changzhi Village, still insisted on settling accounts with the landlords. Baishui Village is constantly subjected to enemy attacks, but the masses have not relaxed the distribution of land while relocating to different places.

    Second, all cadres in the county, from the county level to the village level, launched a movement to perform meritorious service for the people. In any difficult environment, cadres resolutely shared life and death with the masses. Lu Bin, the district chief of the Fourth District, lived with the masses of Baishui Village for more than a month. When the enemy came out, he fought alongside the militia to repel the enemy and continued to hold meetings and carry out struggles as usual. The village chief of Macun struggled against the landlords with the masses during the day and led the masses to monitor the enemy at night, going wherever there was activity.

    Third, taking hired and poor peasants as the backbone, they united with middle peasants to fight together and won over the small and medium landlords. "Fight the big ones, not the small ones." The scope of attack was less than 10%, which made many small and medium landlords willing to automatically settle accounts rather than flee and suffer.

    Finally, the more thoroughly feudalism is attacked, the stronger the peasants' armed forces become. When land reform was first carried out in Macun, only cadres and activists were armed to protect the struggle; but after the feudal forces were completely defeated, the peasants obtained land. An old man clutched a hand grenade day and night, wanting to join the militia to kill the enemy. During the celebration of the turn-over, more than 80 people signed up to join the militia at one time.

### 武装翻身队深入各村庄  垣曲边沿联防分田

    武装翻身队深入各村庄
    垣曲边沿联防分田
    【本报太岳二十三日电】垣曲纠正了“边沿区不能进行土地改革”的思想，斗争烈火弥漫全县，西起皋落、东至垣曲城长达数十里的绛（县）垣（曲）公路上，亦在炮火连天中展开土地还家运动。垣曲曾因战争影响了土地改革，群众运动一度停滞。自全县二月十七日扩干会议动员布置一手拿枪一手分田后，各村农民便掀起“磨快刀砍封建”的总清算运动。目前同善镇、刘村、南堰等村已实现了耕者有其田，驻村、陈村、丰村、宋村等二十余村正在分配果实，白水、长真、杜村等村正在炮火中再接再厉的与封建势力斗争。此次边沿地区群众行动如此坚决的原因：
    重要经验
    首先，以武装保障了土地改革运动，全县建立了统一的土地改革指挥部，组织以营兵、民兵及武工队为骨干的“武装翻身队”，结合各联防村指挥部深入边沿各村，敌人不出进行分田，敌人一动就联防作战。并结合各联防村的警卫民兵向敌人据点展开攻势，绛、垣公路上廿天中每天均有战斗，二月二十六日皋落敌向我长直村进扰，“武装翻身队”即结合民兵于原峪村伏击，长直村所属之火星村群众仍坚持与地主清算。白水村不时遭受敌人进攻，但群众在四处转移中仍未放松分田。
    其次，全县上至县干部、下至村干部皆展开为民立功运动，在任何艰难的环境下，干部都坚决与群众同生死共患难，四区区长吕斌与白水村群众共同生活月余，敌人出来即与民兵并肩作战，打退敌人，照常开会斗争。马村村长白天与群众一块向地主斗争，夜间带领群众监视敌人，那里有动静，就往那里去。
    再次，以雇贫为骨干团结中农一起斗争，并争取了中小地主的回头。“斗大不斗小”，打击面不足百分之十，使得许多中小地主情愿自动清算，不愿逃跑受罪。
    最后，封建打击得越彻底，农民的武装便越坚强。马村在一开始进行土地改革时，仅干部积极分子武装掩护斗争；但将封建势力打得落花流水之后，农民得到了土地，一个老汉白天黑夜皆牢握一颗手榴弹，要参加民兵杀敌。在庆祝翻身大会中，一次报名参加民兵者达八十余人。
