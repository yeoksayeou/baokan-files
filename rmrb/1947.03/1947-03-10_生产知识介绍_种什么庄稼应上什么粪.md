Introduction to Production Knowledge
What Kind of Fertilizer Should Be Applied to What Kind of Crop

Currently, the main agricultural activity is applying manure to the fields. For a piece of land planted with a certain crop, one should know what kind of fertilizer is suitable for that crop to grow well and produce a large yield. If fertilizer is not applied properly, the yield will be small, or even harmful. Now, let me briefly introduce the methods of applying fertilizer for your reference:

First, human excrement and urine (i.e., night soil): Its greatest effect is to make the leaves of crops grow luxuriantly. Therefore, it is suitable to apply more night soil when growing vegetables. It is best to apply it while green for sorghum, corn, and millet; but for cotton or melons, night soil should not be used, or should be used sparingly, to avoid melon vine overgrowth or cotton growing wild branches. In addition, large-leaf tobacco is also not suitable for night soil because it will make the tobacco unsmokable.

Second, ash and soil fertilizer: Mainly wood ash. It can make the branches and stems of crops grow strong and produce more starch. Therefore, when planting wheat, beans, sweet potatoes, yams, and other crops, more wood ash should be applied.

Third, barnyard manure: There are various kinds, such as cattle and sheep manure, mule and horse manure, and pig manure. Among them, cattle and sheep manure has strong potency but is cold in nature and slow to take effect. It is suitable as base fertilizer and spread in the fields, but not suitable for damp and shady land. Generally, it is suitable for planting grain, wheat, vegetables, etc. Mule and horse manure is hot in nature and takes effect quickly. It can be used as base fertilizer for any crop and any soil type. Pig manure is cold in nature and slow to take effect. It is suitable as base fertilizer for various crops and various soil types, but it is not suitable for planting tobacco.

Fourth, kang soil: It is hot in nature and absorbs a lot of water, making it most suitable for planting irrigated land. Except for cotton, eggplant, wheat, beans, and other crops where it should be used sparingly, it is suitable for all other crops.

Fifth, oil cakes: Due to different raw materials, their effectiveness varies in speed. For example, cottonseed and castor bean cakes have slow potency and should be sown at the same time as the seeds. If used as supplementary fertilizer (green application), it must be fermented in advance. Sesame, peanut, rapeseed, and other oil cakes have faster potency and should be used as supplementary fertilizer.

Sixth, green manure: It is suitable for various crops and soils, and is the best base fertilizer. Because it produces organic acids after decomposition, it is especially suitable for alkaline land. In addition, because it contains a large amount of organic matter, it can transform sandy and clay soils into loam. It has the effect of improving the soil. (Xintian)

　　生产知识介绍
    种什么庄稼应上什么粪
    目前一般农事的主要活动，是往地里送粪。那块地种什么庄稼，就应该知道这种庄稼使什么粪，才能长得好，产量大。如果使粪不得当，产量就会小，或者反倒有害。现在把使粪方法简单介绍一下，以供各地参考：
    第一、人粪尿（即大粪）：它的最大功效就是能使庄稼的叶子长得茂盛。所以种蔬菜就适于多施大粪。种高粱、玉茭、谷子就顶好抓青；种棉花或瓜，就不能用大粪或少用。免得瓜闹秧或棉长疯条子。此外，种大叶烟也不适用大粪。因为使上大粪，烟就不好吸了。
    第二、灰土粪：主要是草木灰。它能使庄稼的枝干长的强壮，又能多生淀粉。所以种小麦、豆类、红薯、山药蛋等作物时，应多使草木灰。
    第三、圈粪：有牛羊粪、骡马粪、猪粪等多种。其中，牛羊粪劲大性冷，奏效慢，宜当的粪，撒在地里用，但不适于发阴地，一般种谷、麦、蔬菜等都适用这种粪。骡马粪，性热劲快，什么庄稼什么土质，都可用作的粪。猪粪性冷劲慢，宜做的粪，适于各种庄稼，各种地质，但种烟不合适。
    第四、炕土：性热吸水多，最适合种水浇地。除棉花、茄子、麦、豆类等作物宜少用外，对其他各种作物都很适合。
    第五、油饼：因原料不同，其效力也各有快慢。如棉籽蓖麻饼，劲慢、应和种子同时播下，如当补肥（抓青），事先一定要发酵才好。而芝麻、花生菜籽等麻饼，劲都较快，应作补肥用。
    第六、绿肥：宜于各种庄稼和土壤，当的粪最好。因为它腐烂后发生有机酸，所以特别适于碱地。此外，又因为它含有多量的有机质，所以能变沙土、粘土为壤土。有改良土壤的作用。（心田）
