Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: According to reports from the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on the 28th and 1st, the Kuomintang authorities, under the pretext of preventing the activities of "unstable elements," will adopt a "joint guarantee system" for civil servants and soldiers nationwide. Major cities have begun preparations to "purge" these so-called "unstable elements." The Beiping area has already started, and it is reported that Beijing, Shanghai, and other places will follow suit. Currently, the Kuomintang Postal Administration has secretly ordered all its employees to implement the "joint guarantee method," requiring each employee to complete the joint guarantee letter before March 15th. Shanghai postal workers are panicked and unanimously refuse to fill it out, and are scheduled to hold a general meeting of all employees on the afternoon of the 28th to discuss countermeasures. The main content of the "joint guarantee method" implemented by the Postal Administration's circular is: "Each bureau should organize employees serving in the same section or bureau in groups of three to five, fill out joint guarantee letters, and mutually guarantee not to participate in 'reactionary work'." "If any of the jointly guaranteed employees discover that any person in their joint guarantee group has 'reactionary behavior,' they should report it secretly in writing or orally to their superior official, and after verification, they should immediately report it to the local police station for arrest."

　　蒋介石统治内部不稳公务员军人须具联保
    【新华社延安三日电】据沪文汇报二十八日及一日消息：国民党当局借口防范“不稳分子”活动，将对全国公务员及军人采用“联保制度”，各大都市已从事准备“肃清”此种所谓“不稳分子”。北平方面业已开始，京沪等地闻亦相继实行，现国民党邮政总局已密令各所属员工，即实行“联保办法”，限各员工于三月十五日前将联保书填写完毕。沪邮局员工群情惶惑，一致拒绝填写，并定于二十八日下午召开全体员工大会商讨对策。邮政总局通令执行之“联保办法”，主要内容为“各局应就组织中同股、同局服务之员工以每三人至五人为一组，填具联保证书，互相担保不参加‘反动工作’”。“联保员工如发现本联保组内任何一人有‘反动行为’，应以书面或口头向该主管长官秘密举发，经查明后，应立即报请当地警局逮捕”。
