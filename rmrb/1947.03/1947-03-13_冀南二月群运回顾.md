Review of the February Mass Movement in Southern Hebei
Ji'nan Branch

The mass movement in the Southern Hebei Region in February presented more prominent issues compared to the previous months. A thorough and comprehensive inspection was universally conducted in all areas. Reviewing the development in various regions over the past month, the following three issues emerge:

I. Vigorous Implementation and Ongoing Pursuit of the Policy of Thoroughly Eliminating Feudalism. Following the in-depth investigation by the District Party Committee's mass movement investigation team in key areas, and after careful and thorough inspections by various counties, it was proven that a considerable number of feudal landlords still existed in the vast rural areas who had not been eliminated. In the investigation in the Sixth and Eighth Districts of Guan County alone, only about one hundred households out of one hundred and thirty-four landlord households were liquidated. Even those that were liquidated were not done so thoroughly. Landlords in the two districts of Guan County owned 22,000 mu of land. Naturally, the land problem for poor farmers would not be thoroughly resolved.

Since discovering twelve overlooked landlord households in Zhenghe Village, Wei County, after going deep into basic units, Wei County issued two calls: "Repeatedly Inspect and Thoroughly Eliminate Feudalism." Zhenghe also created experience in this regard. The sixty-one groups of the Farmers' Association launched extensive democratic discussions on policies and class divisions. In the class division process, they not only looked at the past from the present, exposing the landlord Zhao ×× who attempted to evade liquidation through fake family divisions; but also, in discussing policies, they connected with political conditions and re-struggled against six households of hostile, tyrannical cult leaders.

What is even more worth mentioning is that it shattered the complacent thinking of some cadres who believed it was "almost done." In particular, Ji County had previously decided to end the mass movement and shift to production under the leadership. However, after investigations in villages like Zaoyuan revealed the existence of landlords, the county changed its policy. This indicates a significant shift in the thinking of cadres and a concrete manifestation of the work beginning to deepen. The ideological transformation played a decisive role in the smooth progress of the work over the past month.

However, some shortcomings in the work were also exposed. Just taking the reasons for the landlords being overlooked as an example, it was mostly due to the cadres' lack of in-depth work. The landlords dispersed their land and concealed their status. When dividing classes, the cadres (district and village) did not grasp the principles, lacked a clear class viewpoint, and did not follow the mass line, treating landlords as rich peasants or well-to-do middle peasants. Some cadres (district and village) even had unstable stances and protected their relatives and neighbors. These issues should continue to be corrected at present, otherwise, there is a possibility of repeating past mistakes.

II. The Clearing and Distribution of Fruits of Victory and the Return of Cheaply Purchased and Excessively Distributed Fruits of Victory have Attracted Great Attention in Various Regions. The facts of the past month prove that this issue is indeed serious. Some villages had not distributed anything even after several struggles. Even when they were distributed, they were mostly unfair. As Comrade Zhang Yanji, Deputy Minister of the Civil Affairs Department of a certain district committee, stated in his article, "There are problems in every village after a big movement," mainly concerning the issue of the fruits of victory. In addition, it was quite common for district cadres to cheaply purchase fruits of victory. For example, in Ji County and Wu Xun × District, almost all cadres, except for a few, had purchased some.

Various counties have specifically analyzed the situation and formulated specific measures. Many counties have proposed that the main content of the major inspection is to clear the fruits of victory. Those that have not been distributed should be distributed quickly and rationally, those that have been distributed unfairly should be redistributed, compensating the lean with the fat, and cadres who have embezzled or cheaply purchased should resolutely return them to the masses. The actual implementation over the past month has yielded great results. For example, after the village cadres of Pan Village had their thinking straightened out, they voluntarily reported the fruits of victory they had embezzled and consciously returned them to the masses. In particular, the district cadres of Wu Xun Fourth District have returned twenty-six pieces of clothing, thirteen pieces of wooden furniture, and eighteen pieces of items with increased prices, totaling more than 14,000 yuan to the masses.

One of the biggest experiences in carrying out this work is that if the village cadres confess frankly and return the items sincerely, the masses will support them. The more the village cadres cover up their mistakes and dare not confess, the more the masses will oppose them. In addition, if district cadres who have cheaply purchased fruits of victory make a good self-criticism and take the lead in returning them, they will have the capital to carry out the clearing work, and it will be easier for the village cadres to straighten out their thinking, and the clearing work will proceed smoothly.

The biggest problem at present is that some cadres are not conscious and have misgivings in their minds. Some are afraid of losing face, afraid of returning the fruits of victory, and afraid of being dismissed. Some regions have proposed: "Even if you don't say you made a mistake, the masses will know, which is even more embarrassing; correcting mistakes is not embarrassing, but more glorious." Using such facts to conduct education is a good material.

III. Adjusting the Relationship Between Village Cadres and Activists and the Masses has also been Relatively Prominent in this Month. The Fifth District Committee has raised the loudest voice, and the district committee and counties have special instructions. The Fourth District Committee and Linqing, Shen County, and other places have proposed launching a "checking style" movement at the same time as investigating and eliminating feudalism. These are all new spirits shown in February, and also a month when the relationship between cadres and the masses began to improve.

To solve this problem, we must intervene from two aspects. For some, solving the problem of the fruits of victory solves the main part of the problem of village cadres' detachment from the masses. Others are due to the historical leadership's monopoly, which caused the village cadres to be undemocratic, thus detaching them from the masses. The three roots checked out by the county and district cadres in Ji County are very correct. The main responsibility should be borne by the leadership (it is not that there is no reason for the village cadres themselves). This is the correct path to solve the problem.

One problem that has become clear in various places is to take into account the merits of the village cadres, and also to enlighten the village cadres to admit their mistakes to the masses, but the main thing is to mobilize the masses to make suggestions, urge the village cadres to reflect and confess, and lay the foundation for the masses to supervise and educate the cadres. If these three aspects are emphasized solely, there will be deviations. If they are well integrated, the masses will also take into account the merits of the village cadres, the village cadres will also confess and admit their mistakes, the consciousness of the masses will also be improved, and democratic habits will also be cultivated. In addition to appropriate self-criticism of individual responsibility, the most important thing for district cadres is to educate village cadres to help the masses establish a democratic life.

Solving this problem should be a mass-based policy of transforming cadres, handing the cadres over to the masses for supervision and management, and tempering and testing themselves in the democratic life of mass-based regular criticism and self-criticism. The most profound experience in January is why the lesson of serious detachment from the masses still exists after replacing the leadership in one movement after another in the past. Recalling it, it is because when cadres make mistakes, they are replaced by a batch, batch after batch, detaching from the leadership's training and education and the masses' supervision and management. As a result, it will never be replaced well.

　　冀南二月群运回顾
    冀南分社
    冀南区二月群众运动，比较以往数月更有突出的问题。各地均普遍深入的进行全面大检查。回顾一月来各地发展的概况，有以下三个问题。
    一、大力执行了和正在贯彻着彻底消灭封建的方针。自区党委群运调查团深入重点调查后，又经各县认真深入的检查，证明了广大农村仍存在着一批相当数字的封建地主未被消灭，仅冠县六、八区的调查，一百三十四户地主只清算了百多户，即便清算过的也不彻底，冠县两区地主拥有土地两万二千亩，当然贫苦农民土地不会彻底解决。
    威县自深入基点发现郑河一村遗漏地主十二户后，会发出两次号召：“反复检查彻底消灭封建。”在这方面郑河也创造出经验，农会的六十一个小组展开广泛的民主讨论政策，划分阶层。在划分阶层中，不但从现在去看过去，将用假分家企图逃避清算的地主赵××揭发出来；在讨论政策中，并联系了政治条件，将敌性、恶霸六户教主重新斗争。
    更值得提出的是：打破了部分干部认为“差不多二”的自满思想，特别是冀县过去领导上己决定结束群运转入生产，经枣园等村调查发现仍有地主后，改变了方针，这说明干部思想上是一个很大的转折，也是工作开始走向深入的具体表现，一月来工作能够顺利的开展，思想转变起了决定作用。
    但另一方面也暴露了工作中的某些缺点，仅从地主被遗漏的原因来说吧，多是由于干部工作不深入，地主疏散了土地隐蔽起成份，在划分阶层时干部（区村）掌握原则，阶级观点不明确，又没走了群众路线，把地主当成富农或富裕中农，甚或有的干部（区村）立场不稳，包庇了自己的亲邻所致。这些问题在目前仍是应当继续纠正的，不然还有可能踏上过去的复辙。
    二、清理分配果实及退还贱买和多分的果实已引起各地高度的重视。一月来的事实证明这个问题的确严重，有的村几次斗争就没分过，即便分的，也多不公平，正如一地委副民运部长张延积同志文中所谈，“大动后村村有问题”，主要也是果实问题，另外区干贱买果实也相当普遍，如冀县、武训×区除个别干部外，差不多都买了一些。
    各县都具体分析了情况，订出具体办法，不少县份提出大检查的主要内容是清理果实，未分过的要迅速合理分配，分的不公的要重新分配，抽肥补瘦，干部贪污和贱买的要坚决退还群众。一月来的实际执行，收到很大成绩。如潘村村干思想打通后自报贪污果实自觉退给群众，特别是武训四区区干已退给群众衣裳二十六件，木器十三件，增价十八件，共一万四千多元。
    进行这个工作一个最大的体验，村干坦白的好，诚心诚意的退，群众就拥护，村干越掩护自己错误，不敢坦白，群众就反对；另外如有的区干贱买了果实，检讨的好，以身作则，首先退还，作清理工作就有资本，村干也容易打通思想，清理工作就会顺利的进行。
    目前最大的问题，就是有些干部不自觉，思想上存在着顾虑，有的怕丢脸、怕退果实、怕撤职。有的地区提出：“犯了错误不说群众也会知道，更丢脸；有错改错不是丢脸，更是光荣”。拿这类事实进行教育是很好的材料。
    三、调整村干和积极分子与群众的关系在这一月也表现较为突出，五地委提的最响，地委和县都有专文指示；四地委和临清、莘县等地，提出与查灭的同时开展“查风”运动，这都是二月份表现的新精神，也是干部和群众关系开始好转的一月。
    解决这个问题要从两方面插手，有的解决了果实问题，村干脱离群众的问题就算解决了主要部分；另有的是由于历史上领导的包办造成村干不民主，因而脱离了群众，冀县县区干部检查出的三个根源很对，主要责任应由领导上负（不是没有村干本身原因），这是解决问题的正确道路。
    目前各地明确起来的一个问题，就是照顾村干的功劳，又要启发村干向群众认错，但主要还是动员群众提意见，督促村干反省坦白，并打下群众监督教育干部的基础，这三方面如单纯强调那一方面都会出偏向。如结合的好，群众也会照顾了村干的功劳，村干也会垣白认错，群众觉悟也会提高，也会锻炼出民主习惯。区干除了适当的检讨个人责任外，最主要的是教育村干帮助群众建立民主生活。
    解决这个问题，应是群众性的改造干部的方针，把干部交给群众监督管理，从群众性的经常批评与自我批评的民主生活中锻炼自己，考验自己。一月来最深刻的体验是过去一次运动换一次领导，为什么到现在还是严重脱离群众的教训，回忆起来，就是干部有了错误就换一批，一批批的脱离领导上的培养教育与群众的监督管理，结果到什么时候也不会换好。
