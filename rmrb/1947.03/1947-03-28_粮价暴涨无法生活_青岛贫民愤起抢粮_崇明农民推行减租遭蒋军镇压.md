Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th: Qingdao Dispatch: Qingdao's poor people, unable to survive due to soaring grain prices, have launched a struggle to seize grain. Since the beginning of last month, grain prices in Qingdao have risen at an even faster pace. From February 9th to 15th, in just six days, the price of wheat flour soared from 60,000 yuan per bag to 120,000 yuan, an increase of 250% compared to the January price of 33,500 yuan per bag. Chiang Kai-shek's "Emergency Economic Measures" on February 16th failed to halt this upward trend; grain prices continued to rise. Rice shops generally adhere to the principle of "stocking goods, not money," resulting in a situation where there are transactions but no goods, or there is a market but no goods. Ordinary poor people are unable to survive and are now angrily engaging in the struggle to seize rice. On the 7th of this month, a unit in the city transported twelve large carts of rice from its warehouse. As soon as they left the warehouse gate, they were surrounded by over a hundred poor people wielding cloth bags and knives, who cut open the bags and seized all the rice. Military police arrived with guns to suppress them, but to no avail.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: According to a Shanghai newspaper report in February: News from Chongming, Jiangsu, indicates that at the end of last year, an incident occurred in Chongming where the Kuomintang army used armed force to suppress the local peasants' "25% Rent Reduction" movement. After the rule of the Japanese devils was replaced by the Kuomintang rule in Chongming, the lives of the peasants not only did not improve in the slightest, but the amount of rent paid actually increased. The landlords, in collusion with the local county authorities, formed a "Rent Collection Office," using various harsh methods to force peasants to pay rent. A local rural intellectual named Sheng Wuwei explained the significance of the "25% Rent Reduction" to the peasants based on the Kuomintang Central Government's "25%" Rent Reduction decree and the Kuomintang County Government's and County Party Headquarters' proclamation on "25%" Rent Reduction. However, this matter came to the attention of the local Kuomintang authorities, who immediately ordered the first company of the logistics battalion of the 21st Division of the Army stationed in the area to arrest Sheng. The company commander, Ren Bili, later issued a notice stating that this was still a lenient punishment; if it weren't for the local peasants collectively pleading on Sheng's behalf, he would have been subjected to a more severe punishment. After this incident, the "25% Rent Reduction" fraud that the Kuomintang has always been playing was completely exposed among the peasants of Chongming.

    粮价暴涨无法生活
    青岛贫民愤起抢粮
    崇明农民推行减租遭蒋军镇压
    【新华社山东二十六日电】青岛讯：青市贫民因粮价暴涨无法生活，已掀起抢粮斗争。自上月初青市粮价即以较过去更快之速度上涨，二月九日至十五日，六天中麦粉售价即由每袋六万元骤涨至十二万元，较一月份每袋三万三千五百元涨百分之二百五十，二月十六日蒋介石之“经济紧急措施方案”并未能阻止此种上涨趋势，粮价继续上涨，各米店咸抱“存货不存钱”主张，形成有行无市有市无货局面。一般贫民已无法生活，随愤起作抢米斗争。本月七日，该市某单位由仓库运来大米十二大车，甫出库门，即为手持布袋及小刀之百余贫民围住，以刀割袋，将米尽行抢光，宪兵持枪赶至镇压，亦无效果。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据二月沪报载：江苏崇明消息，崇明于去年底曾发生国民党军以武装镇压该地农民“二五减租”运动事件。崇明自日寇统治为国民党统治代替后，农民生活不但未有丝毫改善，地租缴纳量反变本加厉，地主结合当地县当局组成之“收租处”，以各种严厉办法强制农民缴租。当地有一农村知识分子名盛无畏者，即根据国民党中央“二五”减租法令及该县国民党县政府县党部关于“二五”减租之布告向农民阐述“二五”减租之意义，但此事为当地国民党当局获息，即令该地驻军陆军整编二十一师辎重营第一连将盛拘捕；该连连长任必烈事后并发表通告，这还是从轻发落，如果不是当地农民集体为盛请求的话，将对盛施以更重之刑罚云。此事发生后，国民党一向玩弄之“二五”减租骗局在崇明农民中完全被识破。
