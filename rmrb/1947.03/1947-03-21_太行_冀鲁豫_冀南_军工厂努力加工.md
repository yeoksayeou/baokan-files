Taihang
    [Reported from the Taihang area on the 18th] The Taihang × District grenade factory has been carrying out a production increase campaign to support the front lines for a month. In February, the factory's grenade output more than doubled compared to January. Over the past month, the workers' enthusiasm for labor has been extremely high, and they have fully demonstrated their creativity for meritorious service. Processing has become a prevailing trend. Comrades in the carpentry department work overtime until 3 a.m. every day. Comrade Li Chengxi set a goal of drilling 2,000 holes a day, and Kong Xiaocheng gets up at 4 a.m. to start the furnace. Bao Yuquan, the foreman of the sand casting department, modified the windmill furnace, saving one labor unit. He also increased the output from 35 cans per furnace to 50 cans, and increased the casting of shell casings from over 400 to over 600. Carpenter Xin Laiyuan took out his own gear and modified a drilling bed, increasing the number of wooden handle holes drilled from 350 to over 1,700, more than double the output of electric drilling. Non-technical personnel in the factory not only complete their own work but also help complete department work. For example, the fireman drills holes for the carpentry department, the administrative chief personally cooks for comrades working overtime, the sand casting department helps the finished department dig out shell casings and transport them, and Geng Linjing helps the workers working overtime to grind medicine. The movement has improved technology and can save raw materials. The carpentry department's scrap rate, which used to be 60%, is only 8% this month. Ma Hongzhong of the finished department increased potassium nitrate extraction from 60 jin to 100 jin, and production is also becoming more orderly. To celebrate the victory of increased production, the factory issued an extra half-month's salary as encouragement. The district political department also awarded 1,800 yuan. All employees have greater confidence in continuing to increase production.
    
    [Reported from Ji'nan on the 19th] The Gucheng ××× Iron Factory serves the people and has made a profit of 30,000 yuan in four months. Last year, on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, the Gucheng branch of the Ji'nan Bank and county-level agencies established the ××× Iron Factory, with a capital of 418,000 yuan and dozens of workers. They manufacture hand grenades to supply the army and militia, and also manufacture agricultural implements such as pots, plowshares, and grate bars. They can produce more than 100 pots a day, which are still not enough to sell. They manufactured ×× thousand hand grenades in four months. At the end of last year, the settlement showed a profit of 9,735,939 yuan. In addition to the dividends paid to shareholders, each 10,000 yuan of capital received dividends of 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. The factory is currently continuing to expand, and all employees have extremely high morale for production.

    [Reported from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 19th] A campaign for meritorious service is vigorously underway at a certain grenade factory. The factory put forward the slogan "Pave the way for meritorious service ideologically, carry out ideological examination and learning. Struggle arduously and welcome the light." Many comrades said that they should bury themselves in their work; many comrades have formulated plans for meritorious service. Some comrades who originally planned to ask for leave to go home have now abandoned their original intentions. Chen Xide, the leader of the third squad, in addition to taking the lead in sawing, also leads work review meetings every day and writes the minutes of the meetings on the blackboard newspaper. Each unit has collectively put forward work directions. The first platoon put forward "One smooth, two transparent, three invisible" (i.e., the shell is smooth, the screw eye is transparent, and no broken coke, broken iron, broken silk, etc. are seen in the work area), so as to avoid waste of materials. The second platoon proposed "Three insurances" for assembling grenades: "No falling handle, no dud, no firing." The third platoon proposed "Sawing and planing lathes should not stop working." The supply department store held a mobilization meeting for meritorious service. Political Commissar Liu put forward the standards for meritorious service: (1) Work actively and diligently, achieve significant results, and complete tasks on time. (2) Obey leadership and abide by discipline. (3) Warehouse registration is orderly and organized. (4) Goods are not lost or wasted. (5) Procedures are clear, systems are strict, attitude is good, and figures are clear. After deliberation, the entire factory launched a campaign for meritorious service.
