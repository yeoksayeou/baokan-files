    Chairman Yang Plants on the滩地
    Han Cunliang
    One evening, I went to the fields to plant spinach. I suddenly saw Chairman Yang and his guard ahead, walking and talking about how to cultivate and what to plant on that piece of land he was leveling on the river滩. The guard said, "That piece of land should be plowed into ridges to prepare for pumpkins." The breeze carried Chairman Yang's voice: "Don't just plow ridges, plow the whole thing, the soil will be loose, and anything will grow!"
    Chairman Yang's land was in the southeast corner of our spinach field, not far away. As long as I looked up, all his actions would clearly jump into my eyes.
    As soon as he entered the field, he began to diligently and laboriously move stones to build the field dikes. When he got hot, he took off the gray homespun woolen coat he had brought back from Yan'an the year before and placed it on the stone dike he had built, and continued to move stones. In his fifties, with a thin body, in order to support the front line, he disregarded the hard work and fatigue of official duties and continued to actively lead production. I was moved, and quickly took out my camera and walked towards him, capturing his laboring posture of repairing the滩 and building the dikes.
    "Are you looking for me? Is there anything I can do for you?" Chairman Yang asked with a smile as soon as he saw me coming. Then he added, "What do you think is good to plant on this land?" The guard and I replied at the same time, "Pumpkins, corn, millet, anything will grow." He pointed to a long piece that had already been plowed on the west side and said, "That's to prepare for pumpkins, this piece hasn't been decided yet." Then he took the hoe from the guard and began to hoe it, one stroke at a time.
    As the sun was setting, when I finished sowing the five large rows of spinach seeds and was walking back, Chairman Yang was still patiently repairing his newly reclaimed river滩 land.

    杨主席种滩地
    韩村良
    某日傍晚，我到地里去种菠菜。忽见杨主席和他的警卫员在前面，边走边谈着他在河滩修整的那块地怎样耕种和种什么东西。警卫员说：“那块地该刨成沟，准备点南瓜。”微风送来了杨主席的声音：“不要光刨沟，把它统统刨一遍，地刨遍了土松，种什么东西都肯长！”
    杨主席的地就在我们菠菜地的东南角，相距不远。只要抬起头，他的一切动作便都可清清楚楚的跳进我的眼帘。
    他一走进地里，就很紧张而吃力的一块一块搬石头垒地堰。搬得热了，就把他前年从延安穿回的那件灰色土产呢大衣脱下来，放在自己垒好的石堰上，又继续搬起石头来。五十多的年岁，瘦弱的身体，为了支援前线，竟不顾公务的劳碌与疲累而仍如此积极的带头生产着。我感动了，连忙掏出照像机走向他，把他修滩垒堰的劳作姿态摄进镜头。
    “是不是找我？有什么事吗？”杨主席一见我走来，便抬起来笑容可掬的问。接着他又说：“你看这地种什么东西好？”我和警卫员同时回答他说：“种南瓜、玉茭、谷子都可以。”他指着靠西边已经刨过的一长块说：“那是准备种南瓜的，这块还没决定。”说着就又从警卫员手中要过镐头来，一镐一镐的刨起来。
    夕阳西沉时，当我撒完五大畦菠菜籽，往回走时，杨主席仍在耐心的修整着他那块新开垦的河难地。
