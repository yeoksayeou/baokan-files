Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. Deputy Commander Peng delivered a speech at the Yan'an All-Circles Rally to Defend the Border Region and Defend Yan'an. The full text is as follows:

　　Comrades! I have been in Yan'an for four years, and this is the first time I have met with you all. I apologize.

　　Today, we are holding a mobilization rally. Hu Zongnan has deployed seventeen brigades and thirty-five regiments to attack the border region and attack Yan'an. The enemy who invaded Heshui and Qingyang have already been driven out by us!

　　In the direction of Luochuan and Yichuan, the enemy has concentrated thirteen brigades to prepare to invade Yan'an, and we must also drive them out!

　　Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan are mobilizing large armies to attack our border region and undermine peace. For the sake of peace, we must eliminate them. Without eliminating them, there can be no peace. Our peasants want to divide the land, and we must continue to divide it where the land has not been well divided. Even if the enemy comes, we must divide it, because even if the land is divided, the enemy cannot take it away. We must give our sons and grandsons a home and a career. If our peasants do not farm, they will have no food to eat. Hu Zongnan's attack is to destroy our land distribution, so that our peasants will never have the opportunity to turn over. He is protecting the big landlords and protecting the counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, we must truly crush Hu Zongnan's attack and drive him out!

　　Chiang Kai-shek wants to implement dictatorship, and we want democracy, to make China belong to everyone. For the sake of democracy, we must also defeat his attack! Without abolishing Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, there will be no democracy in China!

　　The Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek wants to sell out the country. The first traitor was Wang Jingwei, who sold China to Japan. Now there is another traitor, Chiang Kai-shek, who wants to sell China to American imperialism. If we want the independence of the Chinese nation, we must abolish Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship.

　　To have peace, we must eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's attacking army; to divide the land, we must crush his attack; to have democracy, we must also abolish his dictatorship; if the Chinese nation wants independence, it must also abolish his traitorous dictatorship! If we do not eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's attacking army, none of these four things can be achieved!

　　The question is, can we eliminate his attacking army? We definitely can eliminate it! Some people want to ask me: What evidence do you have? Where is the evidence? Naturally, there is evidence!

　　The events of 1935 are the evidence. At that time, Liu Zhidan in northern Shaanxi only had three thousand people, and later Xu Haidong came, with no more than three thousand people. Finally, the Central Red Army arrived in northern Shaanxi, with only seven thousand people, totaling no more than fifteen thousand people. But how many enemies were there at that time? As far as I remember, there were one hundred and one regiments, three hundred thousand people. Today, Hu Zongnan only has thirty-five regiments. At that time, we only had fifteen thousand people, but today it is different. The border region at that time only had three to four hundred thousand people in five counties, but now we are much bigger. Everyone, think about it, am I lying? (The crowd answers: It's true!) No lies, this is a fact! At that time, the Red Army totaled no more than fifteen thousand people, and the ratio of the Kuomintang and Communist forces was twenty to one; but today he only has thirty-five regiments, seventeen brigades, and we have much more than the fifteen thousand people at that time. Can we win? (The crowd shouts: We will definitely win!) Yes, we will definitely win! At that time, we crossed the Yellow River to Shanxi on the southern front, and later returned across the Yellow River to the western front. We won every battle, so much so that the Northeast Army talked about peaceful resistance against Japan; so much so that Yan Xishan was frightened and sat unsteadily in Taiyuan; so much so that Ma Hongkui lost his troops and generals; so much so that Hu Zongnan was defeated in the battle of Shanchengpu; finally, Chiang Kai-shek also received a lesson in Lintong!

　　Now eleven years have passed, and we probably can't compare it that way. Now, we have already eliminated more than sixty of his brigades and captured one hundred and twenty generals. All our liberated areas, North China, Northeast China, and northern Jiangsu have already risen up to eliminate the enemy's attacks. We must continue to work hard to eliminate another sixty of his brigades, capture another one hundred and twenty of his generals, and capture all the attackers together. In this way, peace and democracy will be realized, the Chinese nation will be independent, and the peasants will have land.

　　Eleven years ago, we won victories, now we win victories, and we will continue to win victories in the future!

　　Hu Zongnan's thirty-five regiments and seventeen brigades are very likely to be wiped out here!

　　After eliminating his thirty-five regiments, and he attacks Yan'an, then perhaps we will have to fight to Xi'an! If we eliminate his thirty-five regiments, he will have no troops in Xi'an, so shouldn't we go to Xi'an? Is this possible? (The crowd shouts: Yes!) Yes, I think it is very possible, as long as everyone works hard! If we work hard, it will be sooner; if we work less, it will be later; but in any case, it is possible!

### 彭副总司令指出  我们一定能打胜仗

　　彭副总司令指出
    我们一定能打胜仗
    【新华社延安九日电】彭副总司令在延安各界保卫边区保卫延安动员大会上讲演，全文如下：
    同志们！我到延安四年了，今天第一次和大家见面，很抱歉。
    今天，我们开一个动员大会；胡宗南已调了十七个旅、三十五个团来进攻边区、进攻延安，敌人侵犯合水、庆阳已被我们打出去了！
    洛川、宜川这方面，敌人集中了十三个旅要准备进犯延安，我们也要把它打出去！
    蒋介石胡宗南调动大军打我们的边区，破坏和平；我们为了和平，就要消灭它，不消灭它就不能和平。我们农民要分土地，土地没有分好的地方还要继续分，敌人来了也要分，因为地分了敌人纵然来了也抬不走；要给我们的儿子孙子成家立业，我们农民不种地就没有饭吃。胡宗南的进攻，就是来破坏我们分地，使我们农民永远没有翻身的机会，它是保护大地主保护反革命的；所以我们要真正粉碎胡宗南的进攻，把它打出去！
    蒋介石要实行独裁，我们要民主，把中国变成是大家的。为着民主，也要打垮他的进攻！不取消蒋介石独裁，中国就没有民主！
    国民党蒋介石要卖国；第一个卖国贼是汪精卫，把中国卖给日本；现在又出了一个卖国贼蒋介石，他要把中国卖给美国帝国主义。我们要中华民族独立，我们就要取消蒋介石的卖国专政。
    要和平，就要消灭蒋介石的进攻军队；要分地就要粉碎他的进攻；要民主，也要取消他的独裁；中国民族要独立，也要取消他的卖国专政！不消灭蒋介石的进攻军队，这四样事情都得不到的！
    问题即是能不能消灭他的进攻军队？一定能消灭它！有人要问我：你有什么证据，证据在那里呢？自然是有证据的！
    一九三五年的事情就是证据，当时陕北刘志丹只不过三千人，后来来了一个徐海东，也不过三千人。最后中央红军开到陕北，也只是七千人，共计不超过一万五千人。可是，那时候的敌人有多少呢？据我记得的，那时敌人有一百零一个团，三十万人。今天，胡宗南却只有三十五个团。那时候我们只有一万五千人，现在可就不同了。边区那时只有三四十万人，五个县，现在我们是大的多了。大家想一想看，我是不是扯谎？（群众回答：是真的！）没有扯谎，这是事实！当时红军却总共不超过一万五千人，国共兵力是二十与一之比；可是今天他只有三十五个团、十七个旅、我们比那时的一万五千人就多的多了。我们能打胜吗？（群众高呼：一定能打胜的！）是的，是一定能够打胜的！当时，我们在南线过黄河到山西，后来又回渡黄河到西线，都是无仗不胜，打得东北军讲了和平抗日；打得阎锡山心惊胆跳，在太原坐不稳；打得马鸿逵损兵折将；打得胡宗南兵败山城堡；最后，蒋介石也在临潼受到了教训！
    现在已过了十一年了，恐怕不能这样来比。现在，我们已经消灭了他六十几个旅，捉了一百一二十个将官，我们所有的解放区，华北、东北、苏北早都起来消灭敌人的进攻；我们要继续努力，再消灭它六十个旅，再捉他一百一二十个将官，把进攻者一起捉来，这样子就会实现和平民主，中华民族就会独立，农民就会有了土地。
    十一年前我们打胜仗，现在我们打胜仗、将来还要打胜仗！
    胡宗南的三十五个团十七个旅有很大可能就被消灭在这里！
    消灭它三十五个团后，他打延安，那时恐怕我们要打到西安去了！消灭它三十五个团，他西安就没有兵力，我们还不到西安去吗？这可能不可能？（群众高呼：能！）是的，我看很可能，只要看大家努力！努力大，早一点；努力小，迟一点；但是，无论如何是可能的！
