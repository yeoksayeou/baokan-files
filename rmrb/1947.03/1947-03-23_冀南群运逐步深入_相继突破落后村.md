    Southern Hebei Mass Movement Gradually Deepens
    Successively Breaking Through Backward Villages
    [Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 21st] The land redistribution and review movement in Southern Hebei is penetrating "backward villages." In Shijiazhuang, First District of Nangong, the landlord Zheng Baozhou owned more than 60 mu of land, had a family of ten, 30 rooms of houses, and more than 100 mu of land in other villages, totaling 160+ mu. He had many ways to control the masses. The women in his family deceived twenty households through the "Bodhisattva Association"; the men deceived more than thirty households in the "One Heart Hall" and "Helping People Association." They gathered on the first and fifteenth of each month, deceiving the masses not to turn over, saying, "The meat on everyone's body cannot stay on your own body." When the mass movement was approaching, he asked his sister, Bao Yu, to be the director of the Women's Association, and he himself infiltrated the Farmers' Association. Due to Zheng Baozhou's cunning, the struggle in this village had risen and fallen three times. Recently, this problem was discovered during the review of rent reduction. First, enlightenment education was carried out on the deceived masses. When the masses became aware, Zheng was expelled from the Farmers' Association, and a struggle was immediately launched against him. Kongzhou Village, Fourth District of Ji County, is a typical backward village. After the rent reduction review was deployed at the end of last year, seventy-two honest peasants were first mobilized to form a Farmers' Association and led the struggle against the landlord Deng Weiyi. The masses raised fifty-two accusations of Deng's crimes, and the peasants finally recovered their blood and sweat accounts. In Yongzhi Cui Village, four landlord households dispersed their land by writing false names, letting others impersonate them, or falsely distributing the land to their daughters. After this review, through discussions in various groups, the landlords' conspiracy was exposed, and a liquidation struggle was carried out. A total of more than 120 mu of land and some movable property were recovered, and red contract documents were found. The other five households that were not thorough were also re-liquidated, and the fruits have all been distributed to the masses.

    冀南群运逐步深入
    相继突破落后村
    【本报冀南廿一日电】冀南各地翻身检查深入“落后村”。南宫一区师家庄地主郑保州，有地六十余亩，人十口，房子卅间，外村地百余亩，共有一顷六十余亩。他统治群众办法很多，他家妇女在“菩萨会”欺骗着二十户；男的在“一心堂”、“扶人会”，则欺骗卅多户。每月初一、十五集合，欺骗群众不要翻身，说：“大家的肉按在自己身上长不住”。群众运动快来到，便叫他妹保玉当妇女会主任，他自己也钻进农会里。由于郑保州的狡猾，该村斗争曾三起三落。最近查减中发现这问题，首先对被骗群众进行了启发教育，群众觉悟了，把郑清出农会，并立即对他进行斗争。冀县四区孔周村是典型的落后村，去年年底布置查减后，首先发动老实农民串连起七十二人，组成农会，领导向地主邓维一进行斗争，群众共提出邓罪恶事实五十二条，农民终于索还了血汗账。永智崔村四户地主，以写假名，让别人顶名或假分给女儿的办法，疏散了土地。在这次检查后，经过各小组讨论，揭破了地主的阴谋，进行了清算斗争，共追回土地一百二十多亩、浮财一部，并追出红契文书。其他五户不彻底者，也重新作了清算，果实已全部分给群众。
