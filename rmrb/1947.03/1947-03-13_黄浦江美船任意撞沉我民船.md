　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Shanghai News: On the 15th of last month, the "Zhongshan" vessel of the American President Lines sank three barges in the Huangpu River. Two crew members, Wang Jinhong and Chen Fucai, went missing. Afterwards, the Shipping Committee determined that the American vessel was at fault for the accident due to navigational errors and should be held responsible. However, because the Chiang government's port committee repeatedly delayed making a decision on the case until the 26th, the offending American vessel had already left Shanghai on the 23rd. The American shipowner also returned to his country with the ship, leaving the owners of the sunken ships with no recourse to sue. This case may end without resolution.

　　黄浦江美船任意撞沉我民船
    【新华社延安十日电】沪讯：上月十五日美国总统轮船公司之中山号轮在黄浦江撞沉驳船三艘，船员王金洪、陈富财二人失踪，事后船舶委员会已判定美轮航道错误应负失事责任，但由于蒋政府港委会一再拖延于二十六日始对此案作决定，该肇祸之美轮则早已于二十三日离沪，美国船主亦随轮返国，沉船之船东将无从控告，此案或将不了了之。
