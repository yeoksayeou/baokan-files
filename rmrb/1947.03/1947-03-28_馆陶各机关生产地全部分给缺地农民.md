    【This newspaper, Jinan, 26th】 During the rent reduction movement in Guantao, wealthy villages were generally mobilized to donate land to poor villages. However, 48 poor villages still had land insufficient for their peasants to cultivate. The county leadership then allocated 2,649 mu of land used for production by various organs and some unallocated confiscated land from traitors to the aforementioned villages. The districts are currently carrying out the allocation.
