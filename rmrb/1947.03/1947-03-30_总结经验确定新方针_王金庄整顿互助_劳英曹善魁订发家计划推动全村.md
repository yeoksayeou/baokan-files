    Sum Up Experience to Determine New Policy
    Wangjinzhuang Rectifies Mutual Aid
    Labor Hero Cao Shankui Formulates Enrichment Plan to Promote the Whole Village
    [Our newspaper, Shexian News] After the land investigation and rent reduction in Wangjinzhuang, a model production village in Shexian County, the village is now, on the one hand, continuing to resolve outstanding issues by combining them with ideological education, and on the other hand, preparing for spring plowing under the leadership of Labor Hero Cao Shankui by summarizing last year's mutual aid experience. The advantages of last year's mutual aid were that groups were formed voluntarily, plans were summarized on a seasonal basis, agriculture and sideline production were combined, and production and war participation were combined. The disadvantages were that individual groups' work conversion was unfair, work points were not used after the autumn harvest, there were still wage arrears, households with livestock plowed the land but did not return the work, the distribution of points for livestock was high, and the distribution of points for labor was low, etc. After two days of discussion, the methods for correcting shortcomings and this year's policies were determined: the original mutual aid groups will be the main force, re-combining voluntarily, work conversion and equivalent exchange must be fair, accounts must be carefully calculated, and each household and each group will formulate production plans on a regular basis. Within five days, twenty-three mutual aid groups were rectified in the whole village.
    [Another dispatch] Labor Hero Cao Shankui has formulated an enrichment plan of "cultivating one and saving two": the whole family has two laborers, planting the original 8.3 mu of flat land and 3 mu of wasteland, applying 45 loads of fertilizer per mu (35 loads last year), which can yield 6.7 shi of refined grain. The whole year can save 284 labor days and 423 livestock days (with two livestock), all of which are used for transportation, helping with busy work, and digging medicinal materials, which can earn a total of 17.7 shi of rice. Two female laborers can earn a net profit of 5.5 shi by spinning and weaving. Other income from raising pigs and chickens, cooperative dividends, etc., can earn a total of 5.7 shi. The total annual income is equivalent to 30.8 shi of refined grain, and the total expenditure is 8.1 shi (for the whole village of six people, calculated at half a jin of rice and one qian of salt per person per day, and one zhang eight chi of cloth), with an annual surplus of 12.7 shi, and a further surplus of 6.5 shi from "cultivating one and saving two". Under his promotion, the whole group also formulated a plan, and group member Zhang Qi (poor peasant) was able to achieve "cultivating one and saving three". Cao is more actively promoting the whole village. Currently, 26 households have formulated household plans, and 13 mutual aid groups have formulated annual production plans.
