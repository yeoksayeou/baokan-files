　　Xing City Catholic Church Espionage Case Trial Concludes; Principal Culprit Ge Lecai and Others Deported
    [Our Newspaper] The principal culprits in the Xingtai City Catholic Church espionage case, Polish Bishop Ge Lecai, Father Lang Benren, and Sister (Superintendent of the Church Hospital) Jin Lanying, after being tried by the Xing City People's Court and patiently educated by the Xing City District Court for over a month, have fully recognized and admitted the crimes they committed. The Municipal Government, based on the severity of their crimes, has handed down separate sentences, deciding to deport Ge and Lang, while releasing Jin Lanying. Thus, the three-month-long case has come to a complete end. Since being transferred from the People's Court to the Xing City District Court at the end of December last year, the court has conducted seven patient interrogations, enabling them to consciously and thoroughly recognize their crimes. Their personal lives were taken care of as much as possible; they were allowed to read, chant scriptures, and pray in court as before. After realizing their crimes, they all expressed deep regret. Ge Lecai said, "I am the bishop of the church, and I should be responsible for the crimes committed by the church. According to the laws of the Catholic Church, we are only responsible for preaching. Colluding with enemy puppets and traitors, trying to keep the puppet army to defend the city, hiding and sending away dozens of big traitors and spies, storing more than sixty guns for them, and organizing spies in schools to carry out sabotage work to oppose the Communist Party and the democratic government are all criminal acts. It's all my fault, and I am willing to turn over a new leaf." Lang Benren also stated, "We should have obeyed the laws of the democratic government when preaching after liberation and should never have colluded with enemy puppets, organized spies, and opposed the people. We should be severely punished for our crimes. Now, we only ask the government for forgiveness and leniency, and I will definitely repent and start anew in the future." Ge and Lang were escorted out of the country by personnel dispatched by the Municipal Government on the 25th of last month.

　　邢市天主堂特务案审判结束
    主犯葛乐才等驱逐出境
    【本报讯】邢台市天主堂之特务案件主犯波兰籍主教葛乐才、神甫郎本仁、修女（教会医院院长）金兰英，经邢市人民法庭审讯及邢市地方法院月余的耐心教育，已完全认识并承认了他们所犯的罪行。市府遂根据其所犯罪行的轻重，分别予以判处，决定将葛、郎两人驱逐出境，金兰英则予以释放。至此，历时三月之久的案件、乃全部结束。葛乐才等三人自去年十二月底，由人民法庭移交邢市地方法院后，法院方面曾先后耐心进行了七次讯问，使他们自觉的彻底认识其所犯罪行；而对于其个人生活方面，则尽量予以照顾，彼等在法院中仍可照旧读书、念经、祈祷。当他们认识所犯罪之后，均深表悔悟，葛乐才说：“我是教堂的主教，教堂所犯的这罪，我都应该负责。按照天主教会法律，我们只管传教，勾结敌伪汉奸，挽留伪军死守城池，掩藏送跑几十个大汉奸特务，存放了他们六十多条枪，并在学校里组织特务，作破坏工作，借此来反对共产党和民主政府，这些行为都是犯罪的，这全是我的错误，我愿意改过自新。”郎本仁亦表示：“我们在解放即传教，应该遵守民主政府的法律，绝不应勾结敌伪，组织特务，和人民作对。论罪我们应受到极严厉的处分。现在，只要求政府原谅宽大，我以后一定悔改自新。”刻葛、郎两人已于上月二十五日，由市府派员押送出境。
