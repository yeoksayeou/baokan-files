　　Selling National Interests to the Point of Administrative Power
    Chiang Allows the U.S. to Establish Aviation Bureau in Shanghai
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】 Yan'an sources point out: The Chiang government's permission for the United States to establish an aviation bureau in Shanghai is a treacherous crime of Chiang Kai-shek, who has completely lost national dignity. This matter shows that American aggression against China has expanded from territorial waters and airspace to the scope of administrative power. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 11th: "Today's Executive Yuan meeting approved the United States to establish a branch of its Civil Aeronautics Administration under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai. The bureau will be responsible for repairing and inspecting American commercial aircraft passing through Shanghai and maintaining its transportation system."

　　卖国卖到行政权
    蒋允美在沪设航空局
    【新华社延安十二日电】延安人士指出：蒋政府允许美国在上海设立航空分局一举，为蒋介石丧尽国格的卖国罪行，此事说明美国侵略中国已自领海领空扩展至行政权范围。据路透社南京十一日电：“今日行政院会议，允许美国在上海美国总领事的管辖下建立其民用航空局分局，该局将负责修理与检查经过上海之美国商用飞机，并维持其交通系统。”
