　　Fight to the End (Clapper Talk)
　　Lin County Sixth District Cadres Cooperation
　　The old rich guys are very cunning,
　　Pretending to be poor, they beg for food.
　　Hiding land, burying silver dollars,
　　Clothes and treasures scattered and concealed.
　　Red contracts, records of grievances,
　　Guns and accusation posters they refuse to relinquish.
　　Fellow villagers, calculate carefully,
　　What to do if they don't hand it over?
　　What to do? Wage a long-term war,
　　It doesn't count until they hand it over.
　　It doesn't count, keep at it,
　　When they hand it over, it's the end, it's the end!
　　Landlords are really slippery,
　　Coaxing cadres, making friends.
　　Arranging marriages, promising tall buildings,
　　Secretly offering cigarettes and inviting to drink.
　　Pulling noodles, with meat sauce on top,
　　Giving money, being generous.
　　Using the "beauty trap" to deceive you,
　　The landlord portrays everything as rosy.
　　Spreading rumors, talking about a change of regime,
　　Luring you onto a paper boat.
　　Comrades, wake up quickly,
　　What are the landlords doing this for?
　　To hide land, to conceal houses,
　　To hide assets and silver dollars.
　　Exploiting people, not repaying debts,
　t for you that they don't have time.
　　They deceive, you are fooled,
　　The masses will not forgive you when they rise up.
　　Tell comrades to think it over,
　　Don't let a thousand days of effort be lost in one day, lost in one day.
　　Landlords are very cunning,
　　As soon as they see us, they laugh heartily.
　　They know what they are doing,
　　Exploiting people and not accounting for it.
　　Afraid of struggle, hiding things,
　　That's why they come to discuss things with us.
　　One pair of pants, two liters of grain,
　　Small favors to trick us.
　　Falsely selling land, secretly storing grain,
　　Clothes in the baggage;
　　Documents, silver dollars,
　　And bullets and guns.
　　Fellow villagers, think about it,
　　Continuing to preserve it is not appropriate,
　　Take it out, it's truly glorious;
　　The masses support and praise you, praise you.
　　Fellow villagers, think back,
　　What kind of life did we live before?
　　Renting land, half the harvest as rent,
　　Forced to do corvée labor to build houses.
　　Grinding rice and flour, washing clothes,
　　Carrying water and sweeping the yard, busy all year round.
　　Visiting relatives, no food provided,
　　Taking care of the dams on rainy days.
　　Carrying silver taels, never-ending,
　　Apportioning funds to buy guns, setting traps for us.
　　Lending grain, adding fifty percent interest,
　　Unable to repay, losing the village land.
　　Selling white flour, cheating people,
　　Making the village property and land completely clean.
　　Landlords don't perform duties,
　　Forcing us poor people to carry it for them.
　　Buying conscripts, the poor suffer,
　　Landlords don't care about the money.
　　Local bullies, carrying guns,
　　Extorting, beating people, raping girls.
　　After exploitation, it's truly pitiful,
　　Just in time for a year of famine.
　　Landlords have stored grain,
　　Not even lending us a taste of fermented fertilizer.
　　Eating white clay, swallowing coarse bran,
　　Leading the whole family to flee from the famine.
　　From Henan to Shanxi,
　　Suffering from cold and hunger.
　　Fellow villagers, think back,
　　How miserable we were then!
　　Now, the sky has cleared,
　　We can avenge our hatred and redress our grievances.
　　Calculate the accounts, it's only right,
　　To recover this debt of blood and sweat.
　　Peasants, unite,
　　We must fight the landlords to the end, fight to the end!

　　斗到底（快板）
    林县六区区干部合作
    老财们，手腕高，
    假装穷人把饭要。
    隐瞒地，埋现洋，
    衣物财宝分散藏。
    红文书，变天账，
    快枪揭帖死不放。
    老乡们，仔细算，
    他要不拿怎样办？
    怎样办，持久战，
    不拿出来永不算。
    永不算，一直干，
    啥时拿出算完蛋、算完蛋！
    地主们，真滑头，
    拉拢干部拜朋友。
    说媳妇，许高楼，
    暗送纸烟请喝酒。
    拉面条，肉浇头，
    又给钱，又糊厚。
    美人计，把你装，
    地主说的八面光。
    造谣言。说变天，
    叫你上了纸糊船。
    同志们，快醒吧，
    地主这样为的啥？
    为隐地，为瞒房，
    为隐资财和现洋。
    剥削人，不还账，
    不是为你没时光。
    他欺骗，你上当，
    群众起来不原谅。
    叫同志，多思量，
    切不要千日功劳一日丧、一日丧。
    地主们，手腕高，
    一见咱来哈哈笑。
    他做事，他知道，
    剥削人来不算了。
    怕斗争，把物藏，
    才来与咱好商量。
    一条裤，二升粮，
    小恩小惠把咱装。
    假卖地，暗存粮，
    包袱里边有衣裳；
    有文书，有现洋，
    还有子弹和快枪。
    老乡们，想一想，
    继续保存不妥当，
    拿出来，真荣光；
    群众拥护又表场，又表扬。
    老乡们，回头想，
    从前过的啥时光。
    租种地，半分粮，
    拉官工来修盖房。
    磨米面，洗衣裳，
    挑水扫院四季忙。
    走亲戚，不管饭，
    阴天下雨管着堰。
    抬银两，没个完，
    派款买枪圈套咱。
    放粮食，加五利，
    还不起了，下庄地。
    卖白面，把人坑，
    庄产地土出弄净。
    地主们，不支差，
    逼咱穷人给他抬。
    买壮丁，穷人难，
    地主们，不计钱。
    恶霸们，提手枪，
    讹人打人奸姑娘。
    剥削完，真可怜，
    恰巧遇上灾荒年。
    地主们，有存粮，
    沤粪也不借咱尝。
    吃白土，咽粗糠，
    领着全家去逃荒。
    由河南，到山西，
    又挨冻来又受饥。
    老乡们，回头想，
    那时咱们多凄凉！
    到现在，露晴天，
    能报仇恨能伸冤。
    算算账，理应当，
    要回这笔血汗账。
    农民们，团结起，
    要和地主斗到底、斗到底！
