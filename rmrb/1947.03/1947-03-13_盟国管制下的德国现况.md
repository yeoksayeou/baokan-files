　　The Current Situation in Germany Under Allied Control
　　Li Yang
　　Nearly two years have passed since the end of the German fascist rule that poisoned the entire world. However, how to handle the German question has always been the greatest concern of peace-loving international democrats around the world. As the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference opens, it is meaningful to introduce the situation in Germany under the separate control of the Allies. The fact is very clear: the Soviet authorities are helping the German people and cooperating with them to transform Germany. On the other hand, the British and American reactionaries do not cooperate with the German people, but oppress them; the Soviet Union adheres to the spirit of the Crimea and Potsdam Conference decisions, thoroughly eliminating Nazism and militarism, while the British and American reactionaries protect Nazi elements, protect the monopoly bourgeoisie, and the roots of the Junker families. One is the people's path, and the other is the anti-people's path.

　　In the Soviet occupation zone, the German people have gained true democracy and freedom rights. All anti-fascist parties—the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Union, and the Liberal Party—have resumed their activities, and in May of last year, they established a People's United Front. The vanguard of the German working class—the Communist Party—closely united with the Social Democratic Party in combat and formed the Socialist Unity Party. The Soviet occupation authorities truly practiced the principle of "enabling the German people to rebuild their new life on a democratic and peaceful basis" (Potsdam Communiqué). In September of last year, elections for local administrative personnel were held successively in the states of Saxony, Thuringia, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania, with more than 90 percent of eligible voters participating. In the “absolutely scientific and error-free” (according to an American journalist who witnessed the election) election, the Socialist Unity Party won the support of the vast majority of voters, who elected more than 70,000 citizens to participate in the administrative work of 146 cities and more than 2,000 rural areas.

　　But what is the situation in the western British and American occupation zones? There, the freedom of the German people has been almost completely deprived, and the activities of various political parties, and even trade unions, are greatly hindered. In the British occupation zone, when anti-fascist workers were preparing to hold a meeting to discuss the struggle against the remnants of German fascism, they were sabotaged by the British military authorities. Some small parties that serve as shelters for anti-democratic elements, such as the Lower Saxony Farmers' Party, the Radical Liberal Party, and the "New Rhineland Party," have been established in the British occupation zone. However, the Social Democratic Party's provincial party headquarters in Schleswig-Holstein was persecuted, and the activities of the German Communist Party were unreasonably limited to the scope of the district, with publishing, propaganda, and activities being restricted in many ways. In Bavaria and the Rhineland, the American military administration appointed unpopular reactionary religious figures to organize the government. The New York Times once pointed out that the first mayor appointed by the American military was "a new Nazi," and the New York World-Telegram also criticized the mayors appointed by the American military in Aachen and Mecklenburg as German industrialists who originally managed military chemical factories. Any mass demonstrations against the current unreasonable control are unreasonably suppressed.

　　In the Soviet occupation zone, land reform began enthusiastically in September 1945. Seven thousand large landowners owned 1,648,898 hectares of land, which have been distributed to landless peasants, agricultural workers, and poor peasants. 59,200 poor peasants, 157,823 landless peasants and agricultural workers, and 64,130 immigrants have received land. However, in the western American and British occupation zones, large estates are still held by war profiteers and large landowners. Hillsfield still owns 675 hectares of land, and arms magnate Krupp owns 4,000 hectares. The British and American occupation zones suffer from a severe shortage of food, and the daily food ration per person has been reduced to 400-500 calories. Last winter, Hamburg experienced a coal shortage, and the prices of essential goods rose, with workers unable to afford even the rationed food with their wages.

　　In the cities of the Soviet occupation zone, the property of Nazi elements was confiscated. As early as May 1945, the Soviet authorities restored free trade and the profit system, and banks and shops reopened. In industry, the monopoly capitalist "cartels" and "trusts" were liquidated, and workers had full control. However, in the British and American occupation zones, industry is still controlled by monopoly capitalists, and many Nazi technicians, managers, and factory owners still occupy important positions in the Ruhr, Essen, Hildesheim, and other industrial areas. The British and American authorities have protected industrialists like Krupp from escaping responsibility for war crimes. On the eve of Christmas last year, the commander of the American occupation forces, McNarney, announced the amnesty of "800,000 minor Nazis." Under the protection of the American authorities, the Nuremberg International Tribunal acquitted three important Nazi war criminals, Papen, Schacht, and Frick, in July last year, arbitrarily undermining the Potsdam decision to severely punish Nazi war criminals.

　　In terms of industrial production, German industry in the Soviet occupation zone reached 70 percent of the production level stipulated by the Allies in 1946, while the British and American occupation zones intentionally prevented the development of civilian industry. They used various means to place the industrial areas of western Germany under British and American capital. Not only did they fail to comply with the Potsdam Conference decision to eliminate Germany's military industrial potential, but they also carried out some special military production. This has resulted in an extreme shortage of daily necessities for the people in the western American and British occupation zones, and their lives are extremely difficult!

　　盟国管制下的德国现况
    李洋
    自从荼毒全世界的德国法西斯统治告终以来，迄今将近两年了。可是如何处理德国问题，始终是全世界爱好和平的国际民主人士所最关注的问题。值此莫斯科外长会议开幕之际，介绍一下盟国分别管制下的德国情况，是有意义的。事实是很明显的：苏联当局是帮助德国人民，与德国人民合作，以改造德国。而英美反动派则不与德国人民合作，相反的是压迫人民；苏联坚持克里米亚、波茨顿会议决定的精神，彻底消灭纳粹主义和军国主义，而英美反动派则包庇纳粹分子，保护独占资产阶级，容克家族的根株。一条是人民的道路，一条是反人民的道路。
    在苏占领区内，德国人民获得了真正的民主、与自由权利。一切反法西斯政党——共产党、社会民主党、基督教民主联盟、自由主义党——已恢复活动，并在去年五月间，建立了人民统一战线。德国工人阶级的先锋队——共产党，与社会民主党在战斗中紧密地团结起来，组成了社会统一党。苏联占领当局真正实践了“使德国人民在民主与和平的基础上，重新建造他们的新生活”（波茨顿公报）的原则。去年九月，在萨克森联合州、约林吉亚州、梅根棱堡、波美拉尼亚各地，曾先后举行地方行政人员的选举，参加选民达百分之九十以上。在“绝对科学而且毫无错误”（目睹选举的美国记者语）的选举中，社会统一党获得了绝大多数选民的拥护，他们选出了七万余公民参加一四六座城市及二千余个乡村区域的行政工作。
    可是，西部英美占领区的情形怎样呢？那里，德国人民的自由已被剥夺殆尽了，各政党、甚至职工联盟的活动，均受到重大的阻碍。英占领区内的反法西斯工人们，当准备集会讨论与德法西斯残余势力进行斗争时，受到英军当局的破坏，一些作为反民主分子庇护所的小党派，如下萨克森农民党、激进自由主义党、“新莱茵党”等，却在英占领区内建立起来了。可是，社会民主党在斯莱维、郭尔坦斯的省党部，却受到迫害，德共产党的活动，更无理的被限于区的范围，出版、宣传与活动，均受到多方的限制。在巴伐利亚及莱茵河各地，美军行政机关曾任命不孚众望的反动宗教分子组织政府，纽约时报曾经指出第一个美军任命的市长便是“一个新纳粹分子”，纽约午报也曾指摘过亚琛和麦克伦堡美军任命的市长是原来管理军用化学工厂的德国实业家。任何反对现行不合理管制的群众示威，都被无理的压抑下去。
    在苏占领区内，一九四五年九月，土地改革已经热烈的开始了。七千个大地主拥有一、六四八、八九八公顷的土地，已经分配给无地农民、农业工人和贫农。有五九、二○○贫农、一五七、八二三无地农民和农业工人、六四、一三○移民得到了土地。可是，西部美英占领区的大地产，仍然握在战争贩子与大地主手中，希尔斯菲德仍拥有六七五公顷的土地，军火大王克虏伯则拥有四千公顷。英美占领区则由于粮食的严重缺乏，每人每日粮食配给量降到四、五百卡罗里。去年冬天汉堡煤荒，必需品价格上涨，工人所得工资连配给食粮也买不起。
    在苏占领区的各城市中，纳粹分子的财产被没收了，早在一九四五年五月，苏联当局便恢复了自由贸易和利润制度，银行商店也开门了，工业中也清算了独占资本家“卡特尔”、“托辣斯”等垄断制度，工人有充分的管制权。可是，在英美占领区内，工业仍掌握在独占资本家手中，许多纳粹技师、经理、工厂主仍在鲁尔、埃森、希尔德海姆及各工业地区占有重要的地位。英美当局曾保护克虏伯一流的工业家逃脱战犯责任。去年圣诞节前夕，美占领军司令麦克纳尼宣布赦免“小纳粹八十万”名。在美国庇当局护下，努连堡国际法厅去年七月曾开释了三名重要纳粹战犯巴本、沙赫特、弗烈兹，任意破坏波茨顿严惩纳粹战犯的决定。
    在工业生产方面，苏占领区的德国工业，于一九四六年内已达到盟国规定生产水平百分之七十，而英美占领区则有意阻止民用工业的发展，他们用各种手段使德国西部各工业区置于英美资本之下，不但不遵照波茨顿会议决定清除德国军事工业潜力，反而进行某些特别的军用品生产。致西部美英占领区人民日用品异常缺乏，生活困苦不堪！
