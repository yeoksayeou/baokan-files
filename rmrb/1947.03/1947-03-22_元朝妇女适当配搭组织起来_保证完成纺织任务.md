[Hsinan Daily, 20th Dispatch] In order to ensure that the soldiers at the front lines are able to wear single-layer clothing in a timely manner, the liberated women of the Yuan Dynasty have launched a spring textile movement. On the 25th of last month, village cadres in the Fifth District enthusiastically discussed the spring textile task at a meeting. Wu Ronglian, the women's director, said, "Even if we aren't given manual labor grain, we should still do it. The soldiers at the front are risking their lives and suffering for us. We don't transport supplies or carry stretchers, so what else are we women doing if we don't complete the textile task?" The 321 village cadres immediately launched a competition and set out the following conditions: (1) Guarantee the mobilization to complete the textile task. (2) The spun cotton should be fine, white, and even. (3) The woven cloth should be flat, smooth, and dense. After the women's association director of Mao Su Village returned to the village, she quickly convened a meeting of all the women in the village, specifically stating that weaving cloth should be done even more carefully than weaving for themselves, so that the soldiers at the front can wear it for a few more days, which would count as the women's association fighting against Chiang Kai-shek. Everyone said in unison: "We will complete the task within the prescribed period, and we will definitely not fall behind other villages." They immediately compiled statistics on all the looms and spinning wheels in the village, and paired those who could weave with those who could not. The old women cooked, milled flour, and took care of the children. Lu Gaizhi, the women's association director of Hou Liusheng Village, said at a meeting of all the women in the village: "It is the duty of our women to provide the front-line troops with single-layer clothing. Our village has to weave 900 feet of cloth." Before she finished speaking, Zhao Mishun's mother stood up and said, "I'll weave 60 feet, okay? If it's not woven well and doesn't pass inspection, I won't take the cotton or grain, and I'll even ask everyone to criticize me." They enthusiastically formed voluntary groups of those who could weave and spin. Just as the meeting was about to end, a woman in her forties rushed in, complaining in a flustered manner, "There's no cloth for me to weave? Why didn't you call me to the meeting?" Director Lu quickly replied, "Mother Yue'e, don't be angry. In the future, we will definitely look for you first to weave cloth and make shoes for the front-line soldiers." Only then did Mother Yue'e happily say, "I heard that our women are weaving cloth for the Eighth Route Army, but I'm not weaving any. I'd be so sorry to the Eighth Route Army!"

    元朝妇女适当配搭组织起来
    保证完成纺织任务
    【本报冀南二十日电】保证前方战士及时穿上单衣服，元朝翻身妇女掀起春季纺织运动。上月二十五日，五区村干大会上热烈讨论今春纺织任务，妇女主任吴荣莲说：“别说还发给手工粮，不给也应干，前方战士为咱拚命受罪，咱不运输又不抬担架，不完成纺织任务我们妇女做啥。”三百二十一名村干随即掀起竞赛，纷纷订出条件：（１）保证动员完成纺织任务。（２）纺花要细白又匀。（３）织的布要平、光、稠。毛苏村妇会主任回村后，很快召开全村妇女会，特别说明织布要比织自己的还得认真，使前方战士多穿几天，也算我们妇会抗了老蒋。大家齐口同声说：“按规定时期完成任务，一定不落到外村后边。”随即把全村织布机和纺花车统计好，会织的和不会织的配备开，老婆婆做饭、磨面、看孩子。后刘胜妇会主任卢改枝在全村妇女会上说：“叫前方军队穿上单衣是咱妇女应尽的任务，咱村要织九百尺布。”话未讲完，赵米顺娘就站起来说：“我织六十尺吧，织不好验不上，棉花粮食都不要，还要请大家批评。”热热闹闹把能织能纺的都自愿组成小组。刚要散会忽又来了一个四十多岁的妇女，慌慌忙忙的埋怨说：“没有我织的布啦，开会怎不叫我呢？”卢主任赶快回答说：“月娥娘，你别生气，以后给前线战士织布做鞋一定先找你。”月娥娘这才高兴的说：“我听说咱妇女给八路军织布，单我不织，这多对不起八路军呀！”
