    The following is a transcript of the resolution on German reparations from the Potsdam Conference of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States on August 3, 1945, for readers' reference:

    (1) Soviet reparations claims will be met by the transfer of assets from the Soviet zone of occupation in Germany and appropriate German assets abroad.

    (2) The Soviet Union will be responsible for satisfying Poland's reparations claims from its own share of reparations.

    (3) The reparations claims of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and other countries entitled to reparations will be met from the Western zones and appropriate German assets abroad.

    (4) In addition to obtaining reparations from its own occupation zone, the Soviet Union may also obtain reparations from the Western zones: 1. From significant industrial equipment that is not needed for the German peacetime economy but is suitable for use, such as from the metallurgical, chemical, and machine manufacturing sectors, 15 percent will be extracted and transferred. The Soviet Union will exchange items of equal value, such as food, coal, potash, zinc, timber, pottery, and gasoline products, and other agreed-upon commodities. 2. From these industrial sectors not needed for the German peacetime economy and to be transferred from the German Western zones, 10 percent will be extracted and handed over to the Soviet government as reparations, and the Soviet Union will not need to provide any goods in exchange. The transfer of equipment stipulated in (1) and (2) will be carried out simultaneously.

    (5) The quantity of sectors to be transferred from the Western zones as reparations must be determined within six months from now.

    (6) The transfer of industrial equipment will be carried out as quickly as possible and completed within two years from the date of the decision stipulated in (5). The delivery of products stipulated in (4) section 1 will begin as soon as possible. The Soviet Union will deliver according to the agreed-upon installment method within five years from the date of commencement. The quantity and nature of the industrial sectors not needed for the German peacetime economy and thus provided for reparations will be determined by the Control Council in accordance with the policy formulated by the Allied Reparations Committee with the participation of France, and submitted to the commander of the region where the equipment is originally located for final approval.

    (7) Before the total number of sectors to be transferred is determined, the sectors that can be delivered, as determined by the procedure stipulated in the last item of (6), will be delivered first.

    (8) Except as stipulated in (9) below, the Soviet government waives all claims regarding German enterprises located in the Western occupation zones of Germany in terms of reparations.

    (9) The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States waive all claims regarding enterprises located in the Western occupation zones of Germany, as well as German assets in Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and eastern Italy, in terms of reparations.

    (10) The Soviet government makes no claims on the Allied gold in Germany.
