　　General Secretary of the All-British Miners' Union
    Demands Improved Miner Treatment
    Attlee Seeks Countermeasures
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th – According to a France Press dispatch from London on the 27th, the British Cabinet's special committee responsible for fuel issues will convene again tonight under the chairmanship of Attlee. This meeting is particularly important, as it is anticipated that the General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, Communist Horner, will present the union's demands and the union's counter-proposal to the government's coal production increase plan. Horner told reporters this morning that the miners are demanding a minimum weekly wage of seven pounds; currently, underground miners earn five pounds per week, and surface workers earn four and a half pounds. Horner will also demand the accelerated construction of housing and other improvements for miners. Horner concluded his remarks to reporters by saying, "The government will have to choose between improving the working conditions of miners, or else millions of workers will rely on relief for a living."

    艾德礼正筹对策
    【新华社延安四日电】据法新闻社伦敦二十七日电称：英内阁负责燃料问题的特别委员会，今晚将在艾德礼主持下再次集会。此次会议特别重要，因预料全国矿工联盟总书记共产党员霍尔纳，将提出其工会之要求，及工会对政府煤炭增产计划之对案。霍氏今晨告记者称：矿工要求每周最低工资七镑，矿工现每周地下层工作工资五镑，地面工作四镑半。霍氏亦将要求加速为矿工建造住宅及其他改进，霍氏结束对记者谈话时称：“将使政府在两者之间择其一，或者改善矿工工作待遇，否则几百万工人将依救济为生”。
