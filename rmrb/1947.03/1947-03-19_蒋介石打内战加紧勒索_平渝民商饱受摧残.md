Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Beiping News: The privately-owned Zhongxing Foreign Firm in Rongxian Hutong, Yiwumen Inner Street, Beiping City, was forced into bankruptcy directly due to conscription and extortion by the authorities. This symbolizes the tragic situation of private manufacturers in Beiping City. Since the arrival of Chiang's army in Beiping, from December of the year before last to June of last year, the firm was levied business tax amounting to 20 million yuan. In December of last year, when Chiang Kai-shek conscripted 30,000 soldiers in Beiping, the firm was forced to provide four new recruits, forcing the workers in the firm to be sent, and the firm had to pay 20 million yuan in resettlement fees to the new recruits. However, when handing over the recruits, the police station created trouble, demanding money again and extorting more than 10 million yuan. The remaining nine workers were frightened and ran away, resulting in the complete bankruptcy of the entire foreign firm. The owner of the firm, Liu Yufang, fled Beiping, and now all the houses and properties of the firm have been unreasonably confiscated by Chiang's military police as the location of a detachment.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Chongqing News: In the year of Chiang Kai-shek's all-out civil war last year, the loss of Min Sheng Company's ships in providing transport for soldiers and grain, compared to the cost, reached more than 6.3 billion yuan. The number of ships requisitioned often reached 44, accounting for one-fifth to one-quarter of the ships in service. Calculating by the number of times they were requisitioned, an average of 20 ships per day were requisitioned. Last year, the total debt of the company reached 13.5 billion yuan. The person in charge of the company said: Min Sheng Company has two futures, one is bankruptcy, and the other is a lingering existence. The latter is more likely, but the eventual result is still collapse.

    【新华社延安十六日电】北平讯：平市宜武门内绒线胡同私营众兴洋行，直接因当局征丁与勒索而被迫破产，此象征平市私营厂商的悲惨境遇。自蒋军到平后，前年十二月至去年六月该行即被征收营，税达二千万元，去年十二月蒋介石在平征兵三万，强迫指定该行要出新兵四名，逼得将在该行工人送去，并由该行发给新兵安家费两千万元，但在交差时在警察所又横生枝节，硬要交钱了，又勒索了一千多万元，其余九个工人吓得跑掉，结果整个洋行全部破产。该行主人刘玉芳逃离化平，现该行所有房屋财产全被蒋宪兵无理没收为分队驻所。
    【新华社延安十六日电】渝讯：在蒋介石去年一年大打内战中，民生公司船只应差运兵运粮运费，与成本相较损失达六十三亿余元，被拉差船只经常达四十四艘，占行驶船只五分之一至四分之一，如以应差次数计算，平均每天即达二十艘船应差。去年度该公司负债总额共达一百三十五亿元，该公司负责人称：民生公司有两个前途，一是倒闭，一是苟延残喘，后者可能性较大，但蔓延结果仍是要倒下去。
