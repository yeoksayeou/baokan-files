[From Our Taiyue Dispatch, 1st] Gao Ping is gradually resolving the difficulties with livestock power during the spring transport. After years of destruction by the Japanese puppets, the county's livestock power has been reduced to an unprecedented extent. For example, in the Second District, the entire district's livestock has been reduced to just over 500 head, with each animal plowing an average of over 200 mu of land. On both sides of the Qugao and Jiujin highways, each animal has to plow 300 to 500 mu of land. In Mishan, a key village in the First District, the number of livestock has decreased by two-thirds compared to before the war. This difficulty has been resolved during the mass emancipation movement over the past year, especially in the fill-in movement. For example, Mishan, a key village, has increased by more than 130 head of livestock. The solutions are as follows: (1) Develop sideline occupations to accumulate savings to buy livestock. For example, one farmer in Pang Village borrowed 3,000 yuan from the bank last year, but because the amount was too small to buy livestock, he bought three pigs at the time, raised them to adulthood, and exchanged them for a cow, which has now given birth to a calf. Zhao Zhuang added five new cattle last winter, all of which were purchased with profits from sideline production. (2) Pool the money from the fruits of struggle to jointly purchase livestock. Pang Village used 440,000 yuan from the fruits of struggle to transport livestock from other districts and distribute them to newly emancipated households. (3) Use cooperative dividends to buy livestock. Cooperatives use the dividends obtained by the masses to buy livestock and sell them to the masses. (4) Confiscate livestock returned by the objects of struggle from the feudal remnants. (5) Exchange mules and horses for cattle. Mountainous areas are not suitable for the use of mules and horses, so a small number of mules and horses are exchanged for cattle from the mountains. For example, one household in Mishan exchanged a mule for four cattle from the mountains. (6) Provide preferential treatment in terms of corvée duties to those who are rewarded for raising shares to buy livestock, reducing the number of times their livestock is conscripted for corvée. Nan Zhu Zhuang and other villages have increased a lot of livestock by this method.

　　高平大力准备生产
    多方解决畜力困难
    【本报太岳一日电】高平在春运中，逐渐解决了畜力困难。该县经过数年日伪的摧残，畜力空前减少，如二区全区牲口减至五百余头，平均每头牲口耕种二百亩以上土地。曲高与臼晋公路两旁，每头牲口要耕种三百至五百亩土地；一区米山基点村，牲口较战前减少三分之二。在一年来群众翻身运动中，尤其在填补运动中，解决了这一困难。如米山基点村即增加了一百三十余头牲口。解决办法有如下几点：（１）发展副业积蓄买牲口。如庞村一户农民去年从银行贷款三千元，因数量太少买不到牲口，当时便买下三口猪，养大换了一头牛，现在又生下小牛。赵庄去冬新增五头牛，皆是副业生产盈利买来的。（２）集中斗争果实的银钱合买牲口。庞村以斗争果实中四十四万元，从外区贩回牲口分给新翻身户。（３）以合作社红利买牲口。合作社将群众所得红利，买回牲口卖给群众。（４）查封建尾巴中斗争对象退出的牲口。（５）以骡马调换耕牛。山地不适合使用骡马，便以少数骡马向山下调换耕牛。如米山一户，以一条骡从山下换回四头牛。（６）奖励集股买牲口者，从差务上照顾，减少其牲口支差次数。南朱庄等以此办法增加不少牲口。
