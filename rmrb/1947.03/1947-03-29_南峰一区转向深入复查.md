    Southern Peak First District
    Shifts to In-Depth Review
    [Report from this newspaper's correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 27th] Since the land reform was carried out in the Southern Peak First District in February, the peasants have undergone great changes, and the majority of peasants have now been emancipated. It is now shifting to a stage of consolidation and deepening. The entire district has recovered 4,476 mu of land from landlords, 146 head of draught cattle, and a large amount of houses, grain, and farming tools. 169 extremely poor households and 1,090 poor peasant households have risen to the level of middle peasants. Only 223 poor peasant households have not yet risen. The entire district has seen an influx of 6,005 new members into organizations. The masses have ideologically recognized the principle that labor is the most glorious and exploitation is the most shameful. A folk song circulating among the masses says: "Landlords are bad, landlords are evil, they live off others and do nothing, if everyone were like them, China would be finished." The current issue is further in-depth study and improvement. It is necessary to continue to: 1. Strengthen ideological education, and consolidate the organization. 2. Develop people's armed forces to protect the fields and grain. 3. Thoroughly eliminate feudalism and conduct a review.

    南峰一区
    转向深入复查
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日电】南峰一区自二月起进行土地改革后，农民经过大动，农民已多数获得翻身，现正转入巩固深入阶段，全区计收回地主土地四千四百七十六亩，耕牛一百四十六头，及房子粮食耕具等甚多。赤贫一百六十九户及贫农一千零九十户均已上升为中农。仅有贫农二百二十三户尚未上升。全区涌入组织的新成份有六千零五人。群众已从思想上认识了劳动最光荣，剥削最可耻的道理。群众中流传的歌谣说：“地主坏，地主恶，清吃坐穿活不干，人人都像他，中国早完蛋。”现在是进一步深入与提高问题。要继续作到：一、加强思想教育，整理巩固组织。二、发展人民武装，保田保粮。三、彻底消灭封建，进行复查。
