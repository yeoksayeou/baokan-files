    Jilu Yu Military Direct Organs
    Assist Local Farmers in Overturning Their Situation
    [Our newspaper's front line in Jilu Yu, 22nd dispatch] The Jilu Yu Military Region's directly subordinate organs are helping farmers carry out land reform. The Headquarters specifically established a civil affairs working group to rapidly launch a liquidation movement in coordination with village cadres. Soldiers from the guard platoon and communications platoon stand guard for the masses at night, intercepting seven bags of grain and more than ten bundles secretly transported by landlords, and returning them to the masses. In February, the clothing supply unit of the logistics department assisted farmers in a certain village in recovering more than 350 mu of land, more than 200 shi of grain, and more than 30 rooms from the local tyrant landlord Wang. The Logistics Military Academy extracts cadres, divides them into groups, and goes deep into the villages where they are stationed to carry out land reform in coordination with district and village cadres.
