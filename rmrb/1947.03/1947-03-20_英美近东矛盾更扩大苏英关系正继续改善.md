　　Under worldwide attention, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, aside from the issue of China, conducted its first week of work in a relatively harmonious atmosphere. In the past week, the Moscow conference proceeded simultaneously in three forms: the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on Germany, and the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on Austria. In a series of meetings, the representatives of the four powers extensively exchanged views on issues such as the China issue, the democratization of Germany, the issue of German prisoners of war, the procedures for drafting a German peace treaty, and the issue of German assets in Austria. Some agreements were even reached on the procedures for the German peace treaty. However, the China issue caused considerable waves. On the opening day, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed that "the Foreign Ministers Conference should hear reports from the participants of the previous Moscow Conference on the China Agreement regarding the implementation of the conference's decisions." This suggestion was completely reasonable, and even Marshall, who went to Moscow with a "big stick," could not but superficially accept it at the time, only wanting to play tricks on the "methods and procedures of discussion." Subsequently, the reactionary American newspapers clamored with anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric, and the Chiang Kai-shek government knelt at the feet of its master, weeping and complaining. Later, Bevin proposed a method of off-site discussion. Marshall, feeling guilty, hurriedly agreed again, but on the condition that no communiqué be issued and that no representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek government participate. But by the weekend, Marshall knew that America's actions in China were completely a pile of stinking dog excrement that could not be shown to the public, so he changed his attitude again, completely refusing to discuss the China issue. He only agreed that the three powers would exchange information on the implementation of the agreement on China, and only limited to the issue of the withdrawal of American and Soviet troops from China, and a copy must be given to the Chiang Kai-shek government. Regarding this issue, the Chinese Communist Party has issued a solemn statement on behalf of the Chinese people. The Soviet Union and Britain have not yet expressed their final positions, but it can be asserted that despite the obstruction of the American reactionaries and their running dogs in China, the outcome of the development of the situation will inevitably be beyond their expectations.

　　Another noteworthy event in the past week was Truman's speech to Congress on the 400 million dollar loan to Greece and Turkey on the 12th. In this speech, Truman, in his capacity as president, openly and for the first time clamored about "the Soviet threat" and "the pressure of communism," just as Hitler had done in the past, which was by no means accidental. This, as Wallace said, is "America's crisis," an unscrupulous adventure by the American rulers in the face of economic crisis. "The world is hungry and uneasy, and people everywhere are demanding change. Truman cannot stop these changes any more than he can stop the tide from rising and the sun from setting." (Wallace's words) Truman's behavior completely ignores the United Nations Organization, and whether it is "anti-Soviet" or "anti-communist," it is still a smokescreen. The actual action, as pointed out by the Soviet newspaper, is to "eliminate" the independence of Turkey and Greece, and at the same time, it is the dollar firing on the pound, and American monopoly capital is trying its best to squeeze into the British sphere of influence, which is the expansion of Anglo-American contradictions in the Near East. The British reactionaries are both happy and fearful about the American loan; happy because they can quench their thirst with poison (especially in Greece), and fearful of the "dollar diplomacy's" "replacement." The British official spokesman's "expression of regret" after Truman's speech and the British government's rush to lend to Greece are a true reflection of the above two moods. Within the British Parliament, fierce debates are being aroused regarding the American expansion into the Middle East, and some members have expressed great indignation, advocating that Britain completely break away from American diplomatic influence. The development of this event will increase the distance between Britain and the United States.

　　The visit of the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to Britain during the Moscow Conference symbolizes a new development in U.S.-British-Soviet relations. At the same time, Bevin will discuss the revision and supplementation of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty with the Soviet authorities in Moscow. The continued change in Anglo-Soviet relations has become an inevitable trend, and the obstruction of a few reactionaries will be in vain. (March 18th)

### 英美近东矛盾更扩大苏英关系正继续改善

　　英美近东矛盾更扩大苏英关系正继续改善
    在举世瞩目之下，莫斯科外长会议除了对于中国问题外，是在比较融洽的空气中进行了第一周的工作。过去的一周，莫斯科会议以三种形式同时进行，即四强外长会议、对德外长助理会议、对奥外长助理会议之同时集会。在一连串的会议中，四强代表曾就中国问题、德国民主化问题、德国战俘问题、草拟德国和约之程序问题及德国在奥资产问题等，广泛的交换了意见。德国和约之程序问题，且获得某些协议。惟对于中国问题，则引起相当大的波折。苏外长莫洛托夫于开幕日提出“外长会议应听取前次莫斯科会议关于中国协定参加者作关于会议决定实施情形之报告”的建议，这个建议本完全合理，甚至连带着“太棒”去莫斯科的马歇尔，当时也不能不表面接受，只是想从“讨论方式和程序”上出花样。接着美国反动报纸又大肆反苏反共叫嚣，蒋介石政府跪在他主子裤子下哭诉，后来贝文提出会外讨论办法，马歇尔因为作贼心虚，手忙脚乱又赶紧同意，但以不发表公报和蒋介石代表参加为条件。但到周末，马歇尔知道美国在中国的行动完全是一堆臭狗屎不能见人，所以又改变态度，根本拒绝讨论中国问题，只同意三强方面交换对于执行关于中国协议之情报，且只限于交换美苏军队自中国撤退问题，并须抄一个副本给蒋介石政府。关于这个问题，中国共产党已代表中国人民发表严正声明，苏英尚未表示最后态度，但可以断言，尽管美国反动派及其在中国的走狗横加阻挠，局布发展的结果必然出于他们的意料之外。
    过去一周，另一引人注意的事件，是杜鲁门于十二日关于对希土四万万美元贷款在国会的演说。杜鲁门以总统身份，在这一演说中，公开的首次的叫嚣什么“苏联的威胁”、“共产主义的压力”，有如希特勒过去所作者，绝非偶然。这正如华莱士所说，是“美国的危机”，是美国统治者在经济危机之前不择手段的冒险。“世界在饥饿与不安，各地方的人民都要求改变美国为军事目的贷出的借款，杜鲁门之不能阻止这些改变，犹如他不能阻止潮水的涌来与太阳的下落”。（华莱士语）杜鲁门之这一行为，完全忽视联合国组织，而且不论“反苏”也好，“反共”也好，都依然是一种烟幕。实际行动正如苏报所指出的，是在“消灭”土希两国的独立，同时也是金元向英镑开火，是美国独占资本极力的挤进英国势力圈，是英美在近东矛盾的扩大。英国反动派对美国的贷款，是一则以喜一则以惧；喜的是可以饮鸩止渴（尤其是在希腊），惧的是“金元外交”的“取而代之”。英国官方发言人在杜鲁门演说之后的“表示惋惜”，和英政府之急急忙忙对希贷款的情形，正是上述两种心绪的写照。英国议会内部对于美国向中东扩张，正引起激烈的争辩，一部分议员已经表示极大的愤慨，主张英国完全脱离美国外交影响。这一事件的发展，将加大英美的距离。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团在莫斯科会议期间访英，象征美英苏关系的新的发展。与此同时，贝文将在莫斯科同苏联当局商谈英苏同盟条约之修改与补充的问题。英苏关系将继续改变，已成必然的趋势，少数反动派的阻挠，将徒劳无益。（三月十八日）
