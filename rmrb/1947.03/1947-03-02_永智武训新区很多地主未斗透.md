　　【This dispatch from our newspaper's Jinan, Hebei correspondent on the 27th】According to a report by Comrade Zhang Yanji, special correspondent of the Xinhua News Agency's Jinan Branch: After the great mobilization last year in the Yongzhi and Wuxun New Districts, the economic and political rule of the landlords was basically overthrown, and the peasants who had suffered from feudal oppression and exploitation for thousands of years initially stood up. However, many villages still have many remaining problems. For example, in 68 villages in the Fourth District of Yongzhi, except for the ten small, poor villages in the south that had no struggle content, the villages that underwent great mobilization appeared in the following types: A. Only 12 villages, such as Gaofendui and Cuilou, were fully mobilized by the masses and achieved "land to the tiller." The conditions were: 1. Feudal exploitation has been completely eliminated. 2. The land has been distributed (but not measured, contracted, or taxed). The autumn harvest was reaped by the peasants who divided the land, and some of the movable property was distributed, but some was not. 3. There are sound mass organizations (peasants' association, militia, women's association, children's corps) and mass leaders, and the village chief is newly elected. 4. There are branches that can play a backbone role. 5. Various tasks are easy to promote. B. After the great mobilization, the landlords were generally eliminated (because there were still households that were missed). Due to the village cadres handling everything, the masses were not fully mobilized. After the great mobilization, the village cadres and militia were seriously corrupt and wasted the fruits of the struggle. In terms of work style, they were coercive and commanding, causing the masses to be silent. About half of the villages in the entire district are of this type. For example, in Cuilou, Xiaoqu, and Jia Village, the branches were old branches from the War of Resistance, and the struggle was entirely handled by the branches. The heads of the peasant association groups were not clear about any problems. The head of the peasant association, Jia Guojun, took charge of everything, and the accountant, Jia Guobao, embezzled 4,000 catties of grain and fled. The 14 militiamen spent 800 catties of wheat on steamed buns and 200 catties of wheat on lamp oil when they slaughtered a pig during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. Militiamen had to be hired with money to go out. Once, when they sent soldiers to Liulin, each person was given one dou of wheat per day. This has aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses, and the masses have automatically risen up to clear their accounts. C. Landlords created false struggles during the great mobilization. False struggles occurred in villages such as Hou Lizhuang, Xiao Zhuang, and Tian Zhuang. The landlords of Hou Lizhuang made an agreement with the peasants: if Chiang Kai-shek came, the land would still belong to the landlords; if Chiang Kai-shek did not come, the peasants would farm the land, and the harvest would be divided in half. The landlord's cart was said to belong to the masses, but it was still kept in the landlord's house. Whoever drove the cart had to ask the landlord for instructions. The head of the peasant association was a running dog of the landlord Li Tingyan. D. The fourth type is villages that have not been mobilized at all. There are three villages in the entire district: Meijing, Meiwangzhuang, and Xue Zhuang. In short, the villages of the third and fourth types are still the world of the landlords, and the peasants are still inferior, only the form of expression is somewhat different. The mobilization in the Second District of Yongzhi is also uneven. The worst is the Jin Haozhuang sub-district. All the sub-districts have been struggled against, but the struggles have been very light, and the landlords have not been eliminated. Three of the five village cadres in Jin Haozhuang were addicted to opium, eating and drinking lavishly, womanizing, and embezzling 4 million yuan of the fruits of the struggle. The village cadres spent 230,000 yuan on making indigo-dyed cloth clothes. The village cadres in Yecunzhai Village embezzled and wasted all the fruits of the struggle. Jin Hao Village was struggled against in August last year, and the fruits of the struggle had not been recovered by the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month last year. Even the relatively well-mobilized Wugudao sub-district is uneven. There are 15 villages in this sub-district. Only eight villages, such as Feng Zhuang, Yangqianhuzhuang, and Da Haozhuang, have mobilized the masses and solved the land problem thoroughly. In five villages, such as Li Zhuang, Qi Zhuang, and Shuangjing, the landlords were not thoroughly eliminated, and the masses were not ideologically mobilized. For example, Li Zhuang is all one clan and one surname. Under the landlord's bribery, they only took out part of the land. The masses did not pour out their grievances. During the struggle meeting, the village cadres hired a few people for 5,000 yuan to deal with it because it was not good to see that they did not pour out their grievances. Chengmazhuang and Jiang Zhuang failed to solve the land problem because they were small and poor villages with no landlords. Furthermore, in the Matou sub-district of the Eighth District of Wuxun, the nine villages have not yet been struggled against, and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents are still secretly active there. Although the Liangshuizhen sub-district of the Seventh District has been struggled against, the masses have not been mobilized.

### 永智武训新区很多地主未斗透

　　永智武训新区很多地主未斗透
    【本报冀南二十七日电】据新华社冀南分社特派记者张延积同志报导：永智、武训新区，经过去年的大发动，基本上打垮了地主经济上与政治上的统治，数千年来身受封建压迫剥削的农民初步翻了身，但许多村子还存在着不少遗留问题。如永智四区六十八村，除南部十个小穷村没斗争内容外，其余经过大动村庄出现下面几种类型：甲、经过大动群众充分发动起来并实现了耕者有其田的，只有高粪堆、崔楼等十二个村庄，其条件是：１、封建剥削已彻底消灭。２、土地已经分配（但没有丈量、立约、税契）。去秋庄稼已由分地农民收割，浮财分了一部分，尚有一部分未分。３、有健全的群众组织（农会、民兵、妇会、儿童团）有群众领袖，村长是新选的。４、都有支部，并能起骨干作用。５、各种工作都容易推行。乙、经过大发动，一般消灭了地主（因为还有遗漏户）由于村干包办，群众没有充分发动起来，大动后村干、民兵贪污浪费果实很严重，作风上强迫、命令，致使群众沉寂，全区此种村约占一半。如崔楼、小区、贾庄，支部是抗战时期的老支部，斗争全是支部包办的，一切问题农会小组长都不清楚，农会长贾国俊总揽大权，管账先生贾国保贪污了四千斤粮食逃了。民兵十四人去年中秋节杀了一口猪，光吃馍馍花了八百斤麦子，点灯油用了二百斤麦子，民兵出门得用钱雇，有一次到柳林送参军，每人每天给一斗麦子。这都已激起了群众的不满，群众已自动起来清理他们的账目。丙、大动中地主制造假斗争，在后李庄、萧庄、田庄等村均是假斗争。后李庄地主与农民订约：老蒋来了地仍是地主的，老蒋不来地归农民种着，打了粮食对半批。地主的大车说是归群众了，但仍在地主家放着，谁驶车得上地主家请示，农会长是地主李廷衍的走狗。丁、第四种类型是根本没有发动的村庄，全区共有梅井、梅王庄、薛庄三村。总之第三、第四类型村庄仍是地主的天下，农民仍然是人下人，只是表现形式有些差别。永智二区发动的也不平衡，最差的要算金郝庄小区。该小区都斗了，但斗的都很轻，地主没有被消灭。金郝庄五个村干有三个吸白面，大吃大喝搞娘们、贪污浪费果实四百万元。村干做阴丹士林布的衣服就花了二十三万元。也村寨村的村干把果实都贪污浪费了。金郝村是去年八月斗的，到去年腊月二十七果实还没有追上来。即便发动比较好的五股道小区也是不平衡的。该小区共有十五个村，群众发动起来土地问题解决彻底的只有冯庄、杨千户庄、大郝庄等八个村，李庄、起庄、双井等五个村地主消灭不彻底，群众没在思想上发动起来。比如李庄都是一族一姓，在地主收买下只把土地拿出一部分，群众没有倒苦水，在斗争会时村干因没倒苦水的不好看，花五千元雇了几个人应付了一下。程马庄、姜庄因是小穷村没地主，土地问题未能解决。又如武训八区马头小区，九个村至今还没斗争，蒋特仍在那里秘密活动，七区梁水镇小区虽然斗过了，但群众均未发动起来。
