    Regarding the Anglo-Soviet Treaty

    Readers have recently inquired about the Anglo-Soviet Treaty: How was it signed? What were its contents? And why is it being revised now? Here are comprehensive answers to these questions:

    The Anglo-Soviet Treaty, signed on May 23, 1942, was primarily based on the fact that Hitler was suffering extraordinarily heavy losses under the heroic and powerful blows of the Red Army. Especially significant was the Battle of Stalingrad, in which the Soviet army achieved a complete victory, and the initiative in the war completely shifted to the Soviet Red Army. However, in order to quickly defeat Germany and relieve the suffering of the European people as soon as possible, the Soviet Union hoped that Britain and the United States would rapidly open a second front in the West to cooperate. Therefore, Molotov personally went to London and Washington, completely dispelling the erroneous ideas of Britain and the United States that overestimated the strength of Germany and doubted the peaceful diplomacy of the Soviet Union after the war. The Anglo-Soviet and Soviet-American mutual aid agreements were subsequently concluded. The Anglo-Soviet Treaty was set for a term of twenty years, and its main contents were:

    In the war against Germany and all countries in Europe that joined it in acts of aggression, the two Contracting Parties mutually guarantee each other military and all other kinds of assistance and support. (Article 1) The two Contracting Parties guarantee that they will not enter into any negotiations with the Hitler government or any other German government that has not clearly renounced all aggressive intentions, and will not negotiate or conclude any armistice or peace treaty with Germany or any other country in Europe that joined it in acts of aggression, except by mutual consent. (Article 2) The two Contracting Parties declare their willingness to unite with other like-minded nations to adopt proposals unanimously and act jointly in the post-war period to maintain peace and resist aggression (Article 3, Paragraph 1). Pending the adoption of this proposal, the two Parties shall, immediately after the end of the war, take all measures within their power to ensure that Germany or any country in Europe that joined it in acts of aggression cannot repeat aggression and destruction of peace (Article 3, Paragraph 2). If, in the post-war period, one of the Contracting Parties is involved in war as a result of an attack by Germany or any country mentioned in Article 3, Paragraph 2, the other Contracting Party shall immediately provide the Party involved in war with all military and other support and assistance within its power. This article shall remain in effect until the two Contracting Parties mutually agree that it may be replaced by the adoption of the proposal referred to in Article 3, Paragraph 1. If such a proposal is delayed in adoption, this article shall continue to be effective for twenty years (Article 4). The two Contracting Parties, taking into account the security interests of each Party, agree to work together in close and friendly cooperation after the reconstruction of peace to organize the security and economic prosperity of Europe (Article 5). The two Contracting Parties agree to provide each other with all possible economic assistance in the post-war period (Article 6). The two Contracting Parties guarantee that they will not conclude any alliance directed against the other Party, nor will they participate in any alliance directed against the other Party (Article 7).

    The significance of this treaty was profound, as Molotov said at the time: "It not only consolidated the friendly relations already formed between Britain and the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance given in the war against Hitler's Germany, but also transformed these relations into a solid alliance, becoming the basis for joint action by both sides after the war. It is not only of great political significance in Anglo-Soviet relations, but also of great political significance for the development of international relations throughout Europe."

    But why is it being revised now? This is because the international situation has undergone significant changes after the war, and there are also some negative aspects in the treaty. The changes in the international situation after the war are: (1) Although Hitler and his partners have been eliminated, fascism has been resurrected through the corpses of the United States and reactionary factions in various countries. American imperialism is expanding everywhere, attempting to "annex Britain" (as Comrade Lu Dingyi said). "Britain's dependencies and colonies are all over the world. Under the US imperialist policy of seeking hegemony over the world, in Canada, South America, Australia, the Atlantic islands, in the Middle East Palestine and Arabia, in Egypt, in the Mediterranean, and finally in India and Burma and other places, US imperialism is attacking Britain. These conflicts in some places have developed or are developing into armed struggles. In the future, the possibility of US imperialism provoking aggressive wars against other capitalist countries (primarily Britain) exists" (Comrade Lu Dingyi: Explanation of several basic issues in the post-war international situation). Britain (except for the reactionaries), in order to cope with this reality, has to take precautions and further strive for Soviet cooperation to jointly seek peace in Europe and the world. (2) The economic panic in the United States will arrive this year or next, which is not only a problem for the United States, but also will bring disaster to Britain. In addition, Britain has spent all its savings in the war and is burdened with debt. If it does not further obtain economic assistance from the Soviet Union and strengthen economic reciprocity with the new democratic countries of Europe through Anglo-Soviet economic cooperation, it will have no way to escape the impact of the US economic panic. (3) Post-war Europe is already a new democratic Europe, and the power of the people within Britain is also growing stronger. If the Labor government does not strengthen cooperation with the Soviet Union, it will become isolated from Europe and its own people and head towards decline. (4) The Soviet Union also knows that to ensure world peace, closer cooperation with Britain is necessary, and the Soviet Union's construction and revival also want to obtain Britain's help in certain aspects.

    These are the objective and subjective conditions that led to the two countries' discussions on revising the treaty. At the same time, the Anglo-Soviet Treaty also has negative aspects: according to the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 1, either country may believe that the current or future international security organization is sufficient to guarantee world peace and arbitrarily declare the cancellation of the obligation to "take joint action in the post-war period to maintain peace and resist aggression." This leaves a loophole for British reactionaries to arbitrarily break the treaty. On December 12th last year, Bevin was already talking nonsense, saying: "Britain cannot be obligated to anyone except the UN Charter." He wanted to use the Charter of the United Nations, which does not yet have the full power to guarantee world peace, to tear up the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. Stalin saw this clearly, so in his reply to Bevin's request to extend the treaty for fifty years, he said: "First of all, it should be revised to remove those reservations that extend this treaty." Bevin originally wanted to use the extension to deceive the British people and force the Labor government to improve its relations with the Soviet Union. This false conspiracy has been completely shattered.

### 关于苏英同盟条约

    关于苏英同盟条约
    苏英同盟条约是怎样签定的？内容如何？为什么现在要修改？这些问题近为读者所问及，兹综答如次：
    一九四二年五月二十三日，苏英同盟条约签定的基础，主要是由于希特勒在英勇强大的红军打击下，受到了异常惨重的损失。那时尤其是有决定意义的斯大林格勒一役，苏军取得全胜，战争的主动权便完全转到了苏联红军手中。然而要很快打败德国，提早解除了欧洲人民的痛苦，苏联希望英美迅速在西方开辟第二战场以配合，因此莫洛托夫亲自去到伦敦和华盛顿，把英美对德国力量估计太高，和怀疑战后苏联的和平外交等错误想法作了彻底的扫除。苏英苏美的同盟互助协定也就随之而相继缔定了。苏英条约定期二十年，主要内容是：
    在对德国及在欧洲与之合伙参加侵略行动的所有各国作战中，缔约国双方互相保证彼此给予军事的及其他所有一切种种援助与支持。（第一条）缔约国双方保证，决不与希特勒政府或未明确宣告抛弃一切侵略意图之德国其他任何政府开始任何谈判，除互相同意外，决不与德国或在欧洲与之合伙参加侵略行动的其他任何国家谈判或缔结休战条约或和约（第二条）。缔约国双方声明，愿意联合其他同心合意之国家，一致采纳建议，在战后时期共同行动，以维持和平并抵抗侵略（第三条第一款）。在此项建议尚未采纳以前双方在战事结束之后，当即就权力所及，采取一切措置，务使德国或在欧洲与之合伙参加侵略行动之任何一国，不可能复演侵略与破坏和平（第三条第二款）。倘战后时期中，缔约国之一方，又由于德国或第三条第二款中所述任何一国进攻该方之结果，而被卷入战争时，缔约国之他方，当立即给予被卷入战争之对方以一切军事的与其他在其权力所及之支持与援助。在缔约国双方互相同意承认，可由第三条第一款所拟建议之采纳以代替之以前，本条当始终有效。倘此类建议延不采纳，则本条在二十年内当继续有效（第四条）。缔约国双方顾及每一方之安全利益，同意在再建和平以后，在密切而友好之合作中，共同工作，以组织欧洲之安全与经济繁荣（第五条）。缔约国双方同意，在战后互相给予一切可能之经济援助（第六条）。缔约国双方保证，决不缔结针对另一方之任何盟约，亦不参加针对另一方之任何联盟（第七条）。
    这个条约的意义的重大，诚如当时莫洛托夫所说：“不但巩固了英苏之间已经形成的友谊关系和在反对希特勒德国所进行的战争中，相互给予援助，而且把这些关系，变成巩固的联盟，成为双方在战后共同行动的基础。不只是在英苏关系上有其重大政治意义，而且对于整个欧洲国际关系的发展，也有很大的政治意义”。
    可是现在为什么又要修改呢？这是因为战后国际形势已经有了重大的变化和条约中还有一些消极的部分。战后国际形势的变化是：（一）希特勒及其合伙虽已被消灭，法西斯却借美国及各国的反动派的尸首还魂，美帝国主义到处扩张，企图“吞并英国”（陆定一同志语）。“英国的附属国与殖民地，遍于世界，在美国帝国主义独霸世界政策之下，在加拿大、南美洲、澳州、大西洋岛屿、在中东巴勒斯坦与阿拉伯，在埃及，在地中海，最后在印度与缅甸及其他地方，都有美帝国主义向英国进攻。若干地方的这些冲突，已发展成为或者已成为武装的斗争。在将来美帝国主义向其他资本主义国家（首先是英国）挑起侵略战争的可能是存在的”（陆定一同志：对于战后国际形势中几个基本问题的解释）。英国（除了反动派）为了应付这个现实，他不能不未雨绸缪，更进一步争取苏联合作以共谋欧洲与世界和平。（二）美国的经济恐慌，今明年就要到来，这不仅是美国的问题，而且要遗祸于英国，加以英国在战争中花费了所有积蓄，负着满身债务，如果他不更进一步取得苏联经济上的帮助，并通过英苏的经济合作而加强对欧洲新民主国家的经济互惠，他就没有办法逃出美国经济恐慌的影响。（三）战后欧洲已经是新民主主义的欧洲，在英国内部，人民的力量也日益强大。工党政府如不加强与苏联的合作，就会从欧洲与自己人民中孤立起来，走向没落。（四）苏联也知道要保障世界的和平，与英国更密切的合作是必需的，苏联的建设复兴，某些方面也欲取得英国的帮助。
    这些便是引致两国商谈修改盟约的主客观条件。同时，苏英条约中也是具有消极部分的：根据第三条第一款之规定，两国任何一方都可以认为现在或将来国际安全组织，已经足以保证世界和平而任意宣布取消“在战后时期共同行动以维持和平并抵抗侵略”之义务。这给英国反动派留下了擅自毁约的漏洞。去年十二月十二日贝文就在那里胡说：“英国除对联合国宪章外，无论对谁也不能负义务”。想用现在尚未具有完全保障世界和平力量的联合的宪章，来撕毁苏英盟约。斯大林看清楚了这点，所以在回复他要求延长条约的期限至五十年的一文中说：“首先应当把它修改，取消那些延长这一条约的保留”。贝文原想用延期来欺压英国人民迫促工党政府改善对苏关系的要求，这假阴谋是被粉碎无余了。
