    The Battle of Yan'an
    Fan Bulesi, Translated by Wang Xi
    This article was published in the January 4th issue of the *Millard's Review Weekly*. The author's background is unknown. This is an abridged translation. This foreigner understands the CCP's strategic tactics a hundred times better than Chen Cheng. More than two months before Chen Cheng's boasting, he had already punctured his bragging. He pointed out that not defending a city to the death would be more conducive to "achieving the goal of annihilating enemies with numerical superiority." Therefore, although Yan'an was evacuated, it will not create any surprise or misperception in the minds of Chinese and foreign people who truly understand the Chinese situation.
                ——Editor
    The prelude to the attack on Yan'an began on December 13th, but the tempo was slow due to the following reasons: First, it is too dangerous to attack a well-organized and heavily armed area with only a limited force of 100,000 troops. Second, it takes time to reverse the opposition of domestic and international public opinion to make the attack favorable. Third, the CCP's counterattack in November warned the Kuomintang army, making them more cautious. Unless they find other better ways to stop the CCP army's counterattack, a large-scale attack on Yan'an will only increase the resentment of the people of Yan'an and make them more determined to resist to the end.
    In addition, the CCP's November offensive campaign changed the strategic situation; in particular, the complete collapse of Yan Xishan's headquarters in western Shanxi allowed the CCP army to gain freedom of national movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Chahar-Hebei, and Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu border areas, thus reducing the threat from eastern Hebei to Yan'an.
    In this situation, the struggle for Yan'an will depend on the balance of power between the two sides. The Kuomintang headquarters' original strategic plan—attacking from three sides simultaneously—is difficult to achieve. Current trends indicate that the Kuomintang's last resort may be a surprise attack—using paratroopers or cavalry to stab the heart of the border area, Yan'an. Obviously, this type of action will not achieve any good results in an area full of determined defenders.
    Then, will the battle for Yan'an become the turning point of this war, like the Battle of Stalingrad against the German fascists?
    I personally believe that the time for a global change in the Chinese civil war is near; but in a country like China, this change will not occur in the defense of a certain city like it happened in Stalingrad or Verdun. Because, although the CCP is well aware that they are on an equal footing with the Kuomintang army, they will continue their own type of mobile warfare to destroy the enemy. The CCP is also good at positional warfare, as evidenced by the Battle of Siping Street, but using this strategy against a more powerful enemy cannot achieve the goal of annihilating enemies with numerical superiority. That is to say, we can see that the CCP will not conduct a decisive annihilation of the Kuomintang army solely in Yan'an. The CCP will concentrate superior forces in various regions to defeat the enemy.

    延安之战
    范布列斯  作  汪溪译
    这篇文章发表于一月四日之密勒氏评论周报，作者履历不详，文为节译。这位外国人，对中共战略战术的了解，比陈诚高明何止百倍，在陈诚吹牛以前两个多月，就已把他的牛皮戮穿了。他指出不死守一个城市，是会更加有利于“达到歼灭数量占优势之敌人之目的的”。由此可见，延安虽撤退，不会在真正了解中国情势的中外人士心目中，造成若何惊异和错觉的。
                ——编者
    进攻延安的序曲，已于十二月十三日奏开了，但其节拍是迟滞的，这是由于下列的原因：第一，仅以有限的十万兵力向一组织极好、武装很强的地区进攻，是太危险了。第二，国内及国际舆论的反对，想扭转舆论有利进攻是需要时间的。第三，中共部队在十一月份的反击，警告了国民党军队，使他们更加小心。除非是他们找到其他更好的方法，制止中共军之反击，否则，大规模的进攻延安只会增加延安人民之愤恨，使他们更坚决地抵抗到底。
    此外，中共十一月份的战役攻势，改变了战略形势；特别是阎锡山指挥部在晋西的全部崩溃，使中共军在陕甘宁、晋察冀，及晋冀鲁豫边区取得全国运动之自由，因而减除了东侧冀对延安之威胁。
    在此种情况下，延它之争夺，将决于双方力量之对比。国民党指挥部原来的战略计划——从三面进攻，同时并进——是很难实现的。目前之趋势指明着，国民党之最后一计，可能是一个突然袭击——用降落伞部队或骑兵，或可刺伤边区心脏之延安。显然，这类行动，对于一充满了坚决保卫者的地区，是得不到任何好结果的。
    那末，延安之争夺战，可能象斯大林格勒之对德国法西斯一样，成为此次战争之转捩点么？
    我个人认为，中国内战，全局变动之时期已近在眼前；但是在中国这样的国度里，此变动不会象发生在斯大林格勒或凡尔登一样地发生于某个城市之保卫战中。因为，中共虽确知他们与国民党军立于同等的地位，他们还将继续着自己类型的运动战以摧毁敌人。中共也善于阵地战，四平街之役，即一例证，但运用此战略对付火力较强的敌人，是不能达到歼灭数量占优势之敌人之目的的。这就是说，我们可以看出，中共不会单独在延安进行一次对国民党军有决定意义的歼灭。中共必将在各地区集中优势兵力，以打垮敌人。
