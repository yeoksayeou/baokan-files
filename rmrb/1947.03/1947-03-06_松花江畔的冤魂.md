　　The Unjust Souls on the Banks of the Songhua River
    (Special Correspondent Huashan, Xinhua News Agency)
    When our troops buried the remains of Chiang's soldiers in Qitamu, a strategic point north of the Jilin-Changchun Railway, we collected many family letters. Many of these letters were stained with dirt, the paper crumpled, and affixed with "airmail" stamps. They had traveled from the distant South to the Northeast, and yet managed to reach the hands of loved ones, absorbing the familial love. From these treasured letters, we once again saw that the soldiers of Chiang's army, who boasted of being the "Number One Army in the World," were all kind people forced to the front lines of the civil war. They were driven by the Chiang gang to the banks of the Songhua River in Northeast China, and finally left behind their families suffering from hunger and hardship, dying with unutterable grievances. Among them, what was shocking were letters from Sichuan, the "Land of Abundance," writing of "ten houses, ten empty" and "no harvest of the six grains." The recipient, Liu Jiwei, had already been dismembered. Judging from his clothing, he was a squad leader or platoon leader, while the anxious faces and voices of his parents, wife, and children, as revealed in the letters, leaped off the page. The sending address was "Xinqiao, Tianye Temple, District 3, Qu County, Sichuan." From June 1, 1946 to August 17, four airmail registered letters were sent to Liu Jiwei. The first letter was written by "Brother Liu Guangzhen," and it said: "The prices here are soaring. Rice is 15,000 yuan per stone, and cloth is 12,000 yuan each." After writing, he also told him to "ask for a leave of absence to return home to see your parents and brother to avoid worrying." The letter also勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强
tried to tell him "Don't worry." After a month, his parents wrote, but they started by saying, "Recently, our hometown has suffered from years of famine and drought, and most people have starved to death. Countless people have fled, making it difficult to survive. Ten houses out of ten are empty, and people are eating leaves and green seedlings like livestock. Our family of several people has no one to take care of them. Your brother has a waist ailment and cannot move. You can imagine the situation at home. After seeing this letter, my son, return home quickly. Otherwise, father and son will not be able to meet." After writing the letter, the last sentence was added in a postscript: "Please, please, please come back soon." The handwriting trembled, making it unbearable to read. At the same time, there was also a letter "respectfully" from his sons, Lan Kun and Gui Chen. The six lines of hasty writing, besides wishing him "normal diet and smooth sailing in all matters," were mainly "We, mother and son, are suffering from hardship and hunger at home, hoping you will return home soon to take care of the family, so as not to worry our grandparents." After the tearful appeal, they added two lines at the end of the letter saying: "Uncle Huitong and my third uncle are out of touch. We hope you can inquire about them while you are away."
    The last family letter was written by his wife, Liu Dengshi. Under "Airmail Registered," she specially noted the words "Hurry Up." The letter said: "Since you left, my husband, it has been several years. Who knew that a famine would descend from the heavens, with no harvest of the six grains, and public funds being urged every day, with no food to eat and no money left. Helplessly, nine acres of land were sold, and countless pieces of furniture were gone. The hardship is indescribable..." This family of six, old and weak, placed their hope in "requesting the superiors to grant leave to return home," just like the family letters of other Chiang soldiers. However, the Chiang army "superiors," who were enemies of the people, buried their lives! Even their corpses were abandoned. But the people of the liberated areas cannot allow this abandoned Sichuanese to be exposed to the elements in a foreign land with resentment, nor can they ignore the grievances of the Chiang army's families represented by these blood-and-tear-stained letters.
    Liu Jiwei's family should no longer wait. You should consider your real way out in the future; and the Chiang army officers and soldiers who share the same fate as Liu Jiwei and their families should be clear about the pain of their own disasters and the causes of these disasters.

　　松花江畔的冤魂
    （新华社特派记者华山）
    我军掩埋吉长路北要地其塔木蒋军遗尸时，搜集到许多家信，有很多信竟染满了污痕，信纸揉损，贴的“航空”邮签，从遥远的南方转辗东北，而且竟能落到亲人手中，在他们怀里沾上骨肉的亲情。从这些被珍贵的家信中，我们又一次看到了自夸，“天下第一军”的蒋军士兵，都是被逼送到内战前线的善良人民。他们被蒋家匪帮赶到东北人民的松花江畔，终于撇下饥饿困迫下的家人，含着无以伸诉的冤恨死去了。其中有触目惊心的是“天府之国”的四川来信，竟写着“十室十空”“六粮不收”，收信人刘继威，已经肢体分离。就其衣饰上判断出是班长或排长，而他的父母妻儿，在信中所暴露的焦灼音容，则跃然纸上。发信地址写着“四川渠县三区镇天爷庙新桥”，从民国卅五年六月一日到八月十七日，接连给刘继威来了四封航空挂号信，第一封是“胞兄刘广珍”写的，信上说：“我们这里物价飞涨谷子每石一万元，白米一石五万元，布匹一个一万二千元。”写完以后又叫他“请平安假返家看望双亲与兄以免牵念。”信中还勉强叫他“不要挂念。”过了一个月，他的父母来书，却劈头就说：“近来家乡连年遭荒旱之灾，人饿死大半，外逃者不计其数，实难过活，民间十室十空，人们都食树叶青苗等，实如牲畜，我全家数口无人照管，你哥有腰疾不能动，你想我家却也不难。我儿见信后，即速返里。否则父子就不能见面了。”写完信最后一句话，又补笔加上“千万千万为望归盼。”字迹颤抖不忍卒读。另同一时来的，还有他的儿子兰坤和桂臣“叩禀”的信，草草六行字，除了遥祝“饮食如常诸事顺遂”，便是“俺母子在家受苦挨饿，盼望你早早返里照管家中，以免我祖父母操心为盼依依哀诉之后，又在信末加上两行说：“惠通表叔及我三叔在外都没音信，望您在外打听”。
    最后一封家信，是他的妻子刘邓氏写的，在“航空挂号”底下，还特别注上“加快”两个字，信中说：“自夫去后，不觉数年，谁知天降荒年，六粮不收，又加公款日日督促，口无所食，手无余钱。无奈，地卖九亩，家具无数，苦难之处，一言难尽……”这一家老弱六口，把他们的希望寄托在“请求上官准假返里”，如同其他蒋军士兵的家书一样。但是以人民为敌的蒋军“上官”，却把他们的命葬送了！连尸首也撩下不管。但是解放区的人民，不能象这个被丢弃的四川人，含着怨恨暴尸异乡，也不能象这些血泪写成的家书所代表的蒋军家属的哀怨没人问。
    刘继威的家属现在不应当再等待了，你们应当考虑你们今后真正的出路；和刘继威同命运的蒋军官兵及其家属们，对于自身灾难之惨痛，及造成这种灾难的原因，应当是弄得清楚的时候了。
