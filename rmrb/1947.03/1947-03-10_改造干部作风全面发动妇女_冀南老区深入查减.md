　　Transforming Cadre Work Style, Fully Mobilizing Women
　　Old Liberated Areas in Southern Hebei Province Conduct Thorough Checks and Rent Reduction

[Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 8th] In the old liberated areas of Wei (County), Ju (Lu County), Nan (Gong County), Guang (Zong County), Ping (Xiang County), Lin (Qing County), Wu (Yi County), and Zao (Qiang County), the land reform movement has expanded from specific points to a broader scale, with some areas entering the stage of distributing the fruits of victory. Following the completion of checks and rent reductions in 49 demonstration villages in Wei County, a full-scale mobilization is now underway. In Ju Lu, half – over a hundred villages – have already conducted reckonings with landlords and feudal rich peasants, while other villages are continuing to push forward. In Linqing, four and a half districts west of the river have thoroughly reckoned with landlords' dispersed landholdings. In 270 villages, generally poor peasants have each obtained over three mu of land. In the Second District, peasants in 63 villages have recovered 8,655 mu of land, and eleven "blank villages" have been completely broken through. The movement's characteristics: First, the struggle to eliminate feudalism is closely integrated with the peasants' solidarity movement. Before the checks and rent reductions, contradictions among peasants, between village cadres, and between village cadres and the masses were extremely serious and widespread. Feudal landlords took the opportunity to provoke and buy off individuals to launch counterattacks. Therefore, a "work style rectification" movement to transform old village cadres and activists was widely carried out in various places. As village cadres and activists admitted their mistakes to the masses and established a democratic work style, consulting with the masses on everything, the peasants' enthusiasm for uniting to fight landlords rose to an unprecedented level. The second characteristic of the movement is the broad and enthusiastic participation of women. For example, during the checks and rent reductions in Ju Lu, women participated in every village. When struggling against Song Dechang in Zhao Zhuang, a woman named Li Xiumei led the women in voicing their grievances. When moving the fruits of the struggle, they consciously said, "This is all what was extracted from us." In total, over 20,000 women throughout the county have participated in the checks and rent reductions. When the Fifth District made a concentrated push in the backward villages of Qiu, Liu, Li, Guo, and Zhang Zhuang, it mobilized women cadres from the villages of Nan Bei Yun Qi, Su Jia Zhuang, and Zheng Cun to participate in the work. Having received practical training in their own villages, they had effective methods when working in other villages. The situation in all five backward villages was turned around in seven days. Women in each village participated in the struggle and received a share of the fruits of victory, greatly elevating their status in their families and villages. The reasons for achieving the above results: First, the leadership accepted the experience from the peasant movements in other regions that "if women are not mobilized, it will be difficult to mobilize them later." They realized that only by fully mobilizing women could a grand momentum for the peasant movement be generated and feudalism be completely eliminated. At the beginning of the checks and rent reductions in Ju Lu, it was proposed that "if women in a district cannot be fully mobilized, the land reform cannot be considered completely accomplished." Second, the feudal ideology of male cadres was broken, and the view that "mobilizing women is the business of women cadres" was shattered. Male cadres in various places earnestly worked to mobilize women.

　　改造干部作风全面发动妇女
    冀南老区深入查减
    【本报冀南八日电】威（县）钜（鹿）南（宫）广（宗）平（乡）临（清）武（邑）枣（强）等县老区土地改革运动已由点到面的开展，有的地区进入分配果实。威县四十九个示范村查减结束后，现已走向全面大动。钜鹿已有二分之一——百余村对地主、封建富农进行了清算，其他村庄正继续开展。临清河西四个半区彻底清算了地主的疏散地，二百七十个村庄一般赤贫农均获得三亩以上土地，二区六十三个村农民收回土地八千六百五十五亩，十一个“空白村”完全突破。运动的特点：首先在消灭封建的斗争中密切结合了农民的团结运动。查减前农民内部、村干与村干、村干与群众的矛盾极为严重和普遍，封建地主曾挑拨收买乘机反攻，因此各地普遍开展了改造老村干老积极分子的“查风”运动，由于村干积极分子向群众承认了错误，树立了民主作风，事事和群众商量，农民团结一致斗争地主的情绪空前高涨。运动第二个特点是广大热烈的涌入运动，如钜鹿查减中，村村皆有广大妇女参加，赵庄斗争宋德常时，妇女李秀梅领导妇女诉苦。搬运果实时，她们觉悟的说：“这都是剥削咱的。”总计全县参加查减的妇女已达两万余。五小区突击落后村邱、刘、李、郭、张庄时，就调有南北云齐、苏家庄、郑村的妇女村干参加工作，她们在本村受到实际锻炼，到外村也有办法，五个落后村在七天内全部打开局面。各村妇女参加了斗争，分得了果实，她们在家庭中、譬村中的地位大大提高。获得以上成绩的原因：首先是领导上接受了其他地区的农民运动中如不发动妇女，以后便难发动”的经验。认识了只有充分发动妇女，才能产生农民运动的宏伟声势，彻底消灭封建。钜鹿查减开始便提出“那区妇女若不能充分发动，土地改革便不算彻底完成”。其次是打破了男干部的封建思想，打破了“发动妇女是妇女干部的事”的观点，各地男干部都认真的作了发动妇女的工作。
