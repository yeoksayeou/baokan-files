　　"I had my eye on this pig for a long time!"
　　Guo Jinsheng, a pig-raising expert from Baotou Village, Yangcheng County, offered a whole pig weighing over eighty jin to comfort the troops for the New Year. On the afternoon of the 30th, accompanied by the sounds of gongs and drums, he led the villagers, both men and women, to the courtyard of the Political Department of the Military Region. Two people in front carried a cloth banner with the words "Pig-Raising Expert Comforts Soldiers" written on it, and below hung a glass certificate awarded by the county government. Two people behind carried a large, white pig. The Political Department repeatedly declined, feeling that one pig was too much for one family to offer, but he insisted on leaving the pig behind. The Political Department sent a representative to speak to the masses to express their gratitude and presented them with a red flag. After the masses returned, I invited Guo Jinsheng and the village chief to sit in my house. He said, "I had my eye on this pig for a long time. This year, in October, the superiors called for war preparations, and I sold a litter of pigs, specifically keeping this one to support the army for the New Year! A few days ago, I asked the village chief to first say hello to the county government, but after several trips, it didn't work out. This morning, I personally went to the county to find Secretary Wang, and I said to him: Whether you tell me to support the army or not, I will support the army!" He became more and more energetic as he spoke: "You say it's too much for me to support the army with one pig? I say it's not too much! Before, I was exploited by the monks of Dongguan Road. Pork was sold for eight cents a jin, and I paid forty yuan in interest every year for selling meat. One year, they drove six big, fat pigs from my pigpen with a whip to pay off the interest. I paid interest for a full ten years, and fifty or sixty big pigs were given to them for nothing! I suffered such exploitation from the age of ten to forty-five. When they hit me, they would say: 'If there's wind, go blow it; if there's injustice, go complain. The yamen isn't built of bricks—go ahead!' They also said, 'My pig's head is your garlic, dipping you dry.' It made me angry. In that dark society, the landlords didn't treat us like people. If they told us to go east, we didn't dare turn west. We had to eat hardship our whole lives. My whole family ate locust leaves, and my children starved to death. At that time, although I could raise pigs and farm the land, because I was exploited, I suffered for thirty-five years and was 'still a pauper.'" At this point, he changed his tone and said, "The Eighth Route Army and the democratic government came, and I turned over and even got rich. My land increased to twelve mu, and I also have half a mu of vegetable garden. My eighteen-year-old child is also studying at a college in the city and will get married in a few months. This is all thanks to the good times brought by the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party. Shouldn't I offer a pig to repay their kindness!"

　　“我早打了这口猪的主意！”
    阳城县宝头村养猪行家郭金生，新年慰劳部队八十多斤重的整猪一口。三十日的下午，锣鼓喧天的引着全村男女群众到了军区政治部的院子，前边两个人用杆子横插着一块布，上边写着“养猪行家慰劳战士”，下边还挂着县府奖给的玻璃奖状。后边两个人抬着白白的一口大猪。政治部再三谢绝，觉得他一家慰劳一个猪太多；但他坚决把猪给留下了。政治部派代表向群众讲话表示谢意，并赠给红旗一面。群众回去了，我把郭金生和村长让到我家去坐。他说：“我早打了这口猪的主意，今年十月上级号召备战，我把一窝猪都卖了，专留它叫新年拥军哩！前几天，我就让村长先跟县府打个招呼，跑了几次没说通。今早晨我亲自到县里找着王秘书，我跟他说：叫拥也要拥哩，不叫拥还要拥哩！”他越说越有劲：“你说我拥军一口猪太多？我说可不多！从前我受东关路和尚的剥削，猪肉卖八分钱一斤，我卖上肉每年给上四十元利钱。有一年，人家一鞭子自我猪圈赶了六口大肥猪顶利钱，整整上了十年利，五六十口大猪，就这样白白给了人家啦！就受这样的剥削，十岁上受到四十五岁，人家打了我还说：‘有风你去刮，有冤你去伸，衙门没用砖磊着——去吧！’还说：‘我的猪头你的蒜，蘸也把你蘸干了。’来气我，那种黑暗社会里地主不把咱当人看，人家叫往东，咱不敢往西转，只得一辈子吃到的（吃亏吃到的的意思），我一家人吃槐叶，孩子饿死了，那时我虽能喂猪能种地。因为受剥削，直受了三十五年罪，‘还不是个穷光蛋’。”说到这里，他才转变语气，说：“八路军、民主政府来啦，我翻了身还发财啦。地增加成十二亩、还有半亩菜园。十八岁的孩子，也到城里高校念书，再迟几个月就给他结婚哩。这都是八路军共产党给的好光景，还不应该拿一口猪来报恩吗！”
