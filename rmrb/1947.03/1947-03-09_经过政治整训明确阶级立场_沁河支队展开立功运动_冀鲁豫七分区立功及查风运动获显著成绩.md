　　After Political Consolidation to Clarify Class Standpoint
    Qinhe Detachment Launches Merit Campaign
    Significant Achievements in Merit and Rectification Campaign in the Seventh Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 5th] The Qinhe Detachment seized the gaps in the war to conduct twenty days of political consolidation. During the consolidation, they studied the current situation, recognized the situation, and strengthened their belief in victory. Through the speaking bitterness campaign, their class standpoint was further clarified. After the consolidation, a vigorous campaign to perform meritorious service for the people was launched. On February 16th, a detachment-wide merit conference was held. After the Deputy Political Commissar summarized the speaking bitterness campaign, the venue immediately erupted. Everyone rushed to announce their merit plans. Chen Wanyuan of the Fifth Company said: "Our company is short of twenty rifles and two light machine guns. We are determined to seize them from the enemy and not ask the superiors for replenishment. The seven locally made guns must be exchanged for standard-issue ones." This won warm applause from the audience. Zhang Qicheng, a new soldier who had only enlisted for less than ten days, said: "I joined the army to protect the fruits of our labor, to dig up the old roots and fight Old Chiang. I am not afraid of sacrifice in any emergency." Yan Tujiang, the cook of the Fifth Company, wanted to perform meritorious service for the people with his kitchen knife, guaranteeing that everyone would eat on time, not eat raw rice, and have water to drink. Thunderous applause erupted again. Some people were so anxious that they were sweating because they didn't get a chance to speak. Then, the companies and platoons put forward challenges for killing the enemy and performing meritorious service. Amidst cheers, the detachment leader personally issued merit books to each company and selected the detachment's merit evaluation committee. Finally, the Political Committee called on everyone to deliver on their promises, learn skills to perform meritorious service, and practice mutual assistance. The Deputy Political Commissar led everyone in taking an oath, saying: "We are a group of people who have been exploited and oppressed by evil landlords and despots. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have turned ourselves around, overthrown the evil landlords, and gained freedom and liberation. We are the people's soldiers, willing to dedicate ourselves to the people's cause, to protect our homeland, fields, parents, wives and children, to protect the good times of liberation, to recover lost territories, and to perform meritorious service for the people!"
    [This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 6th] The Seventh Sub-district's local armed forces deployed a "Merit" and "Rectification" campaign in December of last year. It has now been underway for two months and has achieved great results, overcoming right-leaning ideas in the troops, establishing righteousness, and transforming the work style. As a result, combat effectiveness has also been improved. The kill-the-enemy task assigned by the higher authorities for January was completed in half a month. In terms of leadership style and work style, the phenomenon of "no one cares about anyone" between superiors and subordinates has been corrected. Leaders are combining with the masses and implementing the mass line's working method. Some experience has been gained in this process: (1) There must be a widespread and in-depth mobilization work. The better the mobilization, the greater the achievements. For example, everyone in the Nanzhuang Brigade knew about the call for meritorious service and established a clear idea of performing meritorious service. The combat morale of the troops was very high and also very solid. Conversely, if the mobilization is not thorough, or the units have not "rectified," the results are less significant, and the work achievements are small. (2) First, take the initiative to go deep into the lower levels and provide concrete assistance. At the same time, call on everyone to resolve to put down their "burdens." (3) Check the top first, then check the bottom. Leaders should lead by example and provide inspiration, influencing everyone. Do not check behind closed doors; do not only reflect on oneself; one should absorb the opinions of lower-level cadres. "Rectification" is to check how much the results of past rectification campaigns have been transformed in practical work. This is a concrete and frequent work. (4) With the leadership of the Party as the core, convening a "Rectification" meeting will have an even greater effect.

　　经过政治整训明确阶级立场
    沁河支队展开立功运动
    冀鲁豫七分区立功及查风运动获显著成绩
    【本报太行五日电】沁河支队抓紧战争空隙，进行了二十天政治整训。整训中经过时事学习，认清了时局，坚定了必胜信念。经过诉苦运动，更明确了阶级立场。整训后展开了轰轰烈烈的为民立功运动，二月十六日，召开全支队立功大会，副政委把诉苦运动作了总结后，会场马上沸腾起来，人人抢着宣布自己的立功计划。五连是陈万元说：“我们连上缺二十支步枪，两挺轻机枪，决心从敌人手里缴获，不要上级补充。七支土造枪要换成广造的。”博得全场热烈掌声。入伍不到十天的新战士张其成说：“我是为保卫果实刨老根打老蒋参军的，我在任何紧急情况下不怕牺牲。”五连炊事员阎土江要用菜刀为民立功，保证大家按时吃饭，不吃生饭，有水喝，掌声又雷动了。有些人轮不上发言，急得直流汗。接着各连、排又提出杀敌立功竞赛挑战。在欢呼中，支队长亲自发给各连功劳簿，选出支队评功委员会。最后，按政委会召大家时间要兑现，立功要学本事，实行互助。副政委领导大家宣誓，誓言中说：“我们是一伙受恶地主恶霸剥削压迫的人，在共产党毛主席领导下翻了身，打垮恶霸地主，获得自由解放，我们是人民子弟兵，愿献身人民事业，保卫家乡田园父母妻子，保卫翻身好时光，收复失地，为人民立功！”
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】七分区地方武装在去年十二月布置了“立功”与“查风”运动，现已进行两月，得到了很大成绩，克服了部队中的右倾思想，树立了正气，转变了作风。因此，亦提高了战斗力，上级给予的一月份杀敌任务，半月就完成了。在领导作风，工作作风上，纠正了上下“谁也不管谁”的现象，领导与群众结合，实行了群众路线的工作方法。在这个过程中得到了一些经验：（一）要有普遍深入的动员工作、动员的好，成绩就大。如南庄大队人人都知道立功的号召，树立了明确的立功思想，部队的战斗情绪就很高也很巩固。相反的如动员不深入，或未“查风”的单位，显著较大，工作成绩小。（二）首先，动手深入下层，具体的帮助。同时，号召大家决心放下“包袱”。（三）先查上，后查下。首长以身作则，示范启发，以影响大家。不要闭上门查，不能光顾自己反省，应吸收下级干部意见。“查风”是检查过去整风的成果在实际工作中转变了多少，这是一个具体而又经常的工作。（四）以党的领导为核心，召开“查风”会议，效果就更大。
