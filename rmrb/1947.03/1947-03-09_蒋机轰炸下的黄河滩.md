　　The Yellow River滩 Under Chiang Kai-shek's Bombing

　　Chiang Kai-shek deliberately released floodwaters, inundating the homelands of 60 million innocent residents in the riverbeds of Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan provinces. Only after extensive relief efforts and assistance from the democratic government did they begin to find a way to live. Before their tears had dried, Chiang's planes began days of "fatigue bombing"; before the flood disaster was over, they faced "fire" disaster.

　　The 54 embankments along the dangerous section from Lujia to Shilipu were bombed by Chiang's planes seven times on February 14th, 19th, and 26th, destroying all the materials used for reinforcing the embankments. Thousands of residents braved the smoke and flames to fight the fire. Many elderly people, children, and women, lacking water buckets, used their bare hands to scoop up mud and throw it on the fire. The flames illuminated the angry faces of these peasants. They gnashed their teeth, sometimes clenching their fists in fury, sometimes frantically trying to put out the fire. After the fire was extinguished, they began to reinforce the dikes again. An old woman from Lujia carried a basket of wheat straw and hurriedly handed it to a man who was reinforcing the dikes, saying, "Brother, hurry up and use this to reinforce the dikes! This is the wheat straw you use to feed the livestock, but we’ve used it all!"

　　The ferries purchased by the democratic government for the residents of Sunkou with loans were all destroyed by Chiang's planes on February 21st. Sun Jinyuan and his wife, residents of Sunkou, were cutting reeds in the reed fields when Chiang's planes suddenly appeared, and bombs fell with a sharp sound. Sun Jinyuan's left hand was blown off, but his right hand was still clutching the reeds. His wife's brains were splattered all over the ground. Sun Hongfa, who operated a ferry, had his head blown off, and his bloody hands were still tightly gripping the edge of the boat. Sun Hongfang's family of five had 30 mu of land, 22 mu of which were flooded. This bombing killed his entire family, leaving only an elderly mother in her seventies.

　　Many civilian boats sought refuge from the bombing by hiding in the hidden parts of the Qing River, but on the 15th, Chiang's planes discovered them, and all 36 boats were destroyed and sunk. The wide Qing River Bay was stained with blood, and the cries of despair were extremely tragic. A young man from Shaojiaji, only eight or nine years old, stood on the shore cursing. He told the reporter, "My family of three was allocated eight mu of land after we were liberated, but the Yellow River flooded seven mu, and our home was washed away. My parents were killed by the bombing. The government lent us 100,000 yuan, and we just managed to repair a broken ferry, but Chiang Kai-shek destroyed it again. I can't just sit here and die; I have to join the Eighth Route Army and fight Chiang Kai-shek!"

　　蒋机轰炸下的黄河滩
    蒋介石放水归故，淹没了冀晋豫河床内六千万善良居民的家乡。经过民主政府多方救济帮助，他们才开始找到了生活。他们的泪痕未干、蒋机又连日“疲劳轰炸”；水灾未已，又遭“火”灾。
    路家到十里铺的险工有五十四道垛、在二月十四、十九、二十六三天内被蒋机轮番轰炸七次，险工防有条题材料全被焚毁。成千的居民冒着火烟抢救火灾，许多老人、孩子和妇人没有水桶汲水，用双手捧着泥土往火上丢。火焰照耀着这些农民愤怒的脸，他们咬牙切齿，有时狂怒的握着拳头，有时疯狂的抢救。大火扑灭后，他们又开始抢塞堤霸。路家一个老太婆提着一篮麦秸，赶忙递给抢塞的男人说：“大哥，赶快塞吧！这是你喂牲口的麦秸，张嘴都用完啦！”
    民主政府贷款给孙口居民购置的渡船，二月廿一日全被蒋机炸毁。居民孙金元夫妻俩正在苇田里打拨苇子，蒋机突然飞来，炸弹紧声而至，孙金元左手炸飞了，右手还抓着苇子。他妻的脑髓被炸了一地。摆渡船的孙洪发头被炸飞，一双血淋淋的手还紧在船缘上。孙洪方一家五口，三十亩地，被水淹没二十二亩。这次轰炸全家老幼全被炸死，只剩一个七十余岁的老母亲。
    许多民船因逃避轰炸划到清河暗处躲藏，但十五日被蒋机察觉，所有三十六集船全部毁沉。广宽的清河湾，血迹斑斑，啼哭呼号之声极为凄惨。邵家集一个才八九岁的青年在岸边哭着咒骂，他告诉记者说：“俺一家三口，翻身后才分得八亩地，黄水来淹了七亩，家也冲没，爷娘被炸死啦。政府贷给十万元，才修补了一只破渡船，老蒋又给炸毁了。我不能在岸边死受，非跟八路军一起去跟老蒋拚不可！”
