Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th: According to Suiyuan's Kuomintang newspapers, the big traitors of Gui (Suiyuan) Bao (Baotou) who had taken refuge in Ningxia, Lanzhou, Xi'an and other places, have recently returned to Sui and Bao disguised as merchants, carrying large quantities of "yellow goods," "black goods," and "white goods" (gold, opium, silver), taking the opportunity to fly to Tianjin and Beijing to sell them, living a carefree life. In Sui province, from Fu Zuoyi down to the village chiefs, corruption is rampant. In Linting County, the rear of the province, last year the people suffered unspeakable misery from the floods, but the county agricultural official embezzled public grain three times, totaling 1,500 big dan. Bo Youliang, the head of Min Dou Township in Wuchuan, embezzled 10 million yuan under the guise of purchasing grain. Yang Zuoliang, the head of Min Zhi Township in Taolin, embezzled 4.7 million yuan in less than half a year after taking office. Fu Zuoyi has recently increased his extortionate taxes and levies, plundering the people's wealth, with numerous items, including "comfort money," "clothing fees," "pacification fees," and so-called "hard donations," totaling more than ten kinds. In a certain township in Fengzhen, the five villages under its jurisdiction (with a total of more than 400 households) were forced to pay more than one million yuan within two months. Many local administrative officials collude with bandits to plunder on a large scale. Mu Yaowu, the magistrate of Wanquan County in Chahar Province, colluded with bandits such as Chen Xinjing to rob farmers of a large number of livestock and property in Longshengzhuang and Pingdiquan (both belonging to the Sui province) and transported them back to his hometown of Langshan County in the rear. The lives of ordinary middle and lower-level public servants and teachers are extremely miserable. An elementary school teacher described his family situation, saying, "The children are freezing without clothes to wear, and the wife is starving without rice to eat, the more annoyed, the less of an escape." Fu Zuoyi's tyrannical rule has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among his subordinates. An employee of a factory shouted, "We must eliminate the blood-sucking vermin."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Guisui Kuomintang newspapers revealed: Fengzhen, occupied by Fu's army, has become a world of terror. Returning evil landlords wantonly massacre the people. From September to the end of last year, as many as 246 people were brutally murdered. A certain street chief in the city died under a grass-cutting knife, and his head was hung for public display for three days.
