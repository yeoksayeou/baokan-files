Visiting a Woman Who Has Turned Over

　　“Comrade! Please sit down quickly, let me tell you all about my turning over and suffering… Speaking of turning over, I've turned over pretty well. Look at this house, the furnishings in this house, all came from turning over!”

　　It was dusk when I entered Old Mrs. Zhang's house and asked her about her past suffering and her current experience of turning over. Before I could even finish my question, she eagerly began to speak.

　　“I am fifty years old this year. From the time I was married at eighteen, I had little to eat or drink, until the Eighth Route Army came when I was forty-eight. Only then did life begin to change. I suffered for thirty whole years.

　　“My husband died early, leaving behind only half an acre of barren hillside. Adding a woman and a child, all mouths to feed who couldn’t move and work, it really made things difficult for me. But what could I do? I just had to grit my teeth and go to the fields, carry manure, and gather firewood. But no matter how much I suffered, half an acre of barren hillside just couldn't support the three of us. There was no other way, so I had to bite the bullet and work as a day laborer for the landlords. From then on, I knew that landlords were really able to be mean! Comrade! Think about it, in the autumn, harvesting rice for the landlord, suffering all day long, but all I got was thin rice soup and bran cakes. Not to mention white flour, they wouldn't even give you salt.

　　“In April, when the wheat was harvested, I thought about taking the children to pick up some wheat ears, so we could eat a couple of meals of white flour. But before we even got to the edge of the landlord's field, someone yelled and chased us away…” As she spoke, she sighed.

　　“Having suffered a lifetime, now that you've turned over, you should enjoy happiness from now on!” I brought up something to make her happy.

　　“That’s right! Since the Eighth Route Army came, I have been turning over better year by year. I had my child join the Eighth Route Army, to save him from suffering at home with little to eat or drink. Later, the village gave preferential treatment to the families of soldiers, and exchanged my half acre of barren hillside for three more acres of land. From then on, life finally turned around!

　　“The year before last, I harvested five or six *dou* of grain. When I saw the grain entering the door, I couldn't stop smiling. I thought to myself, the Eighth Route Army really brought us a lucky star! Last year, I harvested one *shi*, and this year, my whole family saw another one and a half *shi* of grain. This year, my family of three has nine acres of land. If we work hard, we are sure to see more than two *shi* of grain. If I spin and weave well, life will be even better. I think, these thirty years of suffering were not in vain…”

　　As she spoke, she laughed heartily, a laugh that was truly from the heart.

　　“When you were struggling against the landlords, what were you thinking? Did you feel sorry for them?” I continued to ask.

　　“Feel sorry for them? When I think of how mean they were, I hate them to death, how could I feel sorry for them? All the suffering I endured in the past, wasn't it all because of the landlords' meanness? We can't show any leniency to the landlords! We must overthrow them completely so that we poor people can turn over completely…”

　　访一个翻了身的妇女
    “同志！你快坐下，叫我好好给你说说我翻身和受苦的事。…说起翻身，我总算翻的不坏。你看一这房，这房里的摆饰，都是翻身翻来的呀！…”
    黄昏，当我走进张老太太的家里，问她以前受苦和现在翻身的经历，她不等我的问话落地，就急着讲起来了。
    “我今年五十岁了。从十八岁娶过来就是少吃没喝，一直到四十八岁八路军过来，日子才算变了个样，整整受了三十年的苦。
    “孩他爹死的早，只留下半亩不打粮食的山坡地。再加一个妇女一个小子，都是张嘴要吃不能动弹的人，真是把我难为死了。可是有啥法？我只有咬咬牙，自己下地、担粪、拾柴火。可是死受活受，半亩不打粮食的山坡地，咋个也顾不住三口人吃穿。没有法，我就硬着头皮给人家老财打短工。从那时候，我就知道老财是真能刻薄人呀！同志！你想想，秋天给老财割谷，死受活受的受了一天，可是除了稀米汤糠饼子就啥也吃不上。别说白面见不上，就是想吃点盐，人家都不给。
    “四月里，麦子打下来。心想领着孩们去拾点麦穗，也好吃两顿白面。可是不等俺走到人家老财地边上，就有人嚷嚷着把俺撵走了……”说呐，她叹了一口气。”
    “受了一辈子罪，现在翻了身，往后可该享福啦！”我提起使她高兴的事。
    “对啦：八路军一来，我可是一年比一年翻的好啦。我叫俺孩参加了八路国，省得在家少吃没喝的受罪。后来村上优待抗属，把俺那半亩不打粮食的山坡地换了换，又给添了三亩地，以后这日子总算翻过来啦！
    “大前年，俺收了五六斗粮食。俺看见粮食进门，就笑的合不住嘴，心里想，真是八路军给俺带来了福星啦。前年俺又打了一石，年时个，俺全家又见到了一石五斗粮食；今年俺全家三口人，九亩地，好好作务，保险要见到两石出头的粮食。我再好好纺线织布，生活就更好。我看，这三十年的罪总算没有白受。………”
    说呐，她哈哈的笑起来了，笑的那样爽朗，真是从心的发出来的。
    “斗争老财的时候，你心里怎样想的。不可怜他们吗？”我接着问？
    “可怜他们？想起他们刻薄人的事，恨都恨死了，还会可怜？我自己从前受的罪，那一样不都是老财刻薄的？可不能给老财留情面！非把他们斗垮，俺穷人才能翻透身………。”
