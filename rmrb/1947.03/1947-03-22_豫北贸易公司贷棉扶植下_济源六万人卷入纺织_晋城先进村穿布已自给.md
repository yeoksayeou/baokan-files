    [This report from our Taiyue office, dated the 20th] Under the support of Henan North Trading Company, which has loaned out 250,000 catties of cotton, Jiyuan is experiencing a spring textile movement with over 60,000 women in the county already involved in the textile boom. After the land reform in Jiyuan, the broad masses of rural women have established the idea of becoming prosperous through their own efforts. Upon hearing the news of the Trading Company's cotton loans, they rushed to receive cotton. In eight days, all 250,000 catties of cotton were loaned out. According to the manager of the Trading Company: Jiyuan is a wheat-producing area, and farmers are not very busy in the spring, so there is still a month and a half to carry out textile production. It is estimated that the 250,000 catties of cotton can be woven into 90,000 bolts of cloth. After deducting the cost of the cotton loans, 60,000 bolts of cloth can be earned. At a market price of 3,500 yuan per bolt, this can earn 210 million yuan.

    [This report from our Taiyue office, dated the 20th] Jincheng, which previously had no textile habits, now has 9,525 women who have learned to spin yarn. They use 8,334 spinning wheels and 929 looms, and in two and a half months have spun 21,402 catties of yarn and woven 7,301 bolts of cloth (the above statistics are for four districts). The most advanced villages in textile production, such as Shangcheng and Jinta, have already achieved self-sufficiency in cloth. In the past impoverished lives of the peasants in these villages, in addition to worrying about food and drink, the lack of clothing was a major suffering. In Jinta, more than half of the households didn't even have a quilt for the whole family. An old man's lined garment had been worn for eight years, with patches weighing 13 and a half catties. After their liberation, they obtained production funds, and under the promotion of the government, diligently learned to spin and weave. In Shangcheng village, with a population of 1,031, no one knew how to spin or weave in the past. Now, 325 women have learned to spin yarn, and 113 women have learned to weave cloth. In two and a half months, the entire village has woven a total of 1,094 bolts of cloth, averaging more than one bolt per person.

    豫北贸易公司贷棉扶植下
    济源六万人卷入纺织
    晋城先进村穿布已自给
    【本报太岳二十日电】豫北贸易公司贷出棉花二十五万斤，扶植济源春季纺织运动，全县已有六万余妇女卷入纺织热潮。济源经过土地改革后，广大农村妇女树立了发家致富的思想，听到贸易公司贷花消息后，争先恐后前往领花，八天中二十五万斤棉花已全数贷完。据贸易公司经理谈：济源是产麦区，春季农民不很忙，尚有一个半月时间进行纺织，估计能把二十五万斤棉花织成九万匹布。除贷花成本外，可赚布六万匹。每匹以市价三千五百元计，可赚二万万一千万元。
    【本报太岳廿日电】素无纺织习惯的晋城，现已有九千五百二十五个妇女学会纺纱，彼等以纺车八千三百三十四辆，织布机九百二十九架，在两个半月中纺线二万一千四百零二斤，织布七千三百零一匹（以上为四个区统计）。纺织最先进的上城、靳圪塔等村、已达到布匹自给自足。这些村庄的农民在已往的贫苦生活中，除了发愁吃喝，没有衣服是一大痛苦。靳圪塔有一大半户口全家没一条被子，某一老人的一件袷衣穿了八年，布绽补得有十三斤半。彼等翻身后，得到生产资金，在政府推动下，勤苦的学习纺织。上城村一千零三十一口人，过去没有一人会纺织，现已有三百廿五个妇女学会纺花，一百一十三个妇女学会织布，在两个半月中，全村共织布一千零九十四匹，平均每人一匹以上。
