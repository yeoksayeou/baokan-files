    Persuasion and Education Transform Village Cadres
    Taiping Re-Mobilizes the Masses

    [Report from our newspaper] Chengci's Taiping Village has transformed its village cadres and re-mobilized the masses. Before this land reform and thorough examination, some village cadres were bought off by big landlords and local bullies, shielding landlords and obstructing the struggle of the masses. The head of the Farmers' Association, Yan Fujiang, and the militia captain, Yan Yun, misappropriated 100,000 to 200,000 yuan of fruit proceeds. The masses had opinions but dared not express them. Director Wang of the County Federation and seven district cadres organized an inspection of Taiping Village, going deep into each household to investigate and understand that the masses feared: first, the village cadres would be selfish and seek personal gain, causing them to offend others for nothing; second, the escaped landlords would lead Chiang's troops back. The county and district cadres then persuaded and educated the village cadres to admit their mistakes to the masses and resolve the knots in their hearts. After Yan Fujiang's self-criticism, he said: "From now on, I will resolutely fight the landlords to the end, and will not misappropriate the fruit." The militia captain also admitted his mistakes to the masses. The confidence of the masses was boosted. After two days of networking and uniting with surrounding villages, more than 1,300 people rose up and held a mass meeting, with more than 80 people pouring out their grievances. The feudal fortress of Taiping Village began to be broken through by the masses. (Zhang Zhuyan, Niu Jixian)

    说服教育改造村干
    太平重新发动群众
    【本报讯】成磁太平村改造村干部，重新发动群众。此次翻身大检查前，个别村干部为大地主恶霸所收买，包庇地主，阻碍群众斗争。农会主任阎福江，自卫队长阎云等，挪用果实款十万至廿万元，群众有意见不敢提。县联会王主任，区干部七人，组织对太平村的检查，深入各户调查，了解群众一怕村干部走里自私，自己白得罪人；二怕逃亡地主带领蒋军过来。县区干部即说服教育村干部向群众认错解圪塔。阎福江检讨后说：“今后我要坚决对地主干下去，不分果实了。”自卫队长同样向群众认错。群众信心提高，经过两天串连，联合周围村庄，一千三百余人起来开大会，诉苦的即有八十余人。太平村封建堡垒开始被群众所突破。（张舳岩、牛冀贤）
