    Important Correction
    In the article "Thoroughly Investigate and Eliminate Hidden Landlords" published in the "Work Study" column on page two of this newspaper on February 24th, the materials cited regarding the Gongchengbao, Beizhaolin, and Yahou Lizhuang villages in Qixian County, and the Wuguanying village in Zexian County, do not conform to the facts. We hereby make the following corrections based on a telegram from the Jinnan Branch: (1) The original text in the first to third lines of the third paragraph stated: "After the land reform in the three villages of Qixian Gongchengbao, Beizhaolin, and Yahou Lizhuang was 'completed,' the leadership believed that the twelve landlord households, who had been reduced to middle and poor peasants, still retained an average of 9-12.5 mu of land per person." The "9-12.5 mu of land" referred to the situation before the review by the emancipated peasants, not the situation after the review. (2) The fifth paragraph, lines one to three, stated that "After the land reform in Qixian Gongchengbao, landlords retained an average of 9 mu of land per person, rich peasants 7.7 mu, middle peasants 6 mu, poor peasants 3.4 mu, and extremely poor peasants 1.2 mu." This also refers to the situation before the review by the emancipated peasants, and was mistakenly cited as the situation after the review. (3) The seventh paragraph, lines seven to eight, cited that in Ze Wuguanying "landlords still had an average of 6.07 mu of land per person, with a yield of 4.22 shi, while rich peasants had an average of 9.6 mu of land per person, with a yield of 8.6 shi." The term "landlords" refers to old, weak, widowed, orphaned, and disabled military dependents who were renting out land. Additionally, the so-called rich peasants, apart from one household that was an omitted feudal rich peasant, the remainder were households without labor power, newly wealthy households, and active village cadres. The aforementioned misquotes were all due to insufficient and imprudent research of the materials. We will strengthen corrections in our work in the future and hope that the branches and readers from all regions provide more feedback to improve our work.

    重要更正
    二月二十四日本报二版“工作研究”栏所载《彻底清查消灭隐蔽地主》一文中所引企之县公城堡、北赵林、衙后李庄三村及泽县吴官营村之材料与事实不符，兹根据冀南分社来电更正如下：（一）原文第三段第一行至第三行谓：“企之公城堡、北赵林和衙后李庄等三个村土地改革‘完成’后，领导上认为已下降为中、贫农的十二户地主，每人平均仍留有九——十二亩半地。”其中所引“九——十二亩半地”系翻身检查以前的情况，不是检查以后的情况。（二）第五段第一行至第三行所说“企之公城堡土地改革后，地主平均每人仍留有地九亩，富农七亩七，中农六亩，贫农三亩四，赤贫一亩二”，亦系翻身检查前的情况，误作检查后情况引用。（三）第七段第七行至第八行所引泽吴官营“地主每人平均却尚有地六·○七亩，产量四·二二石，富农每人平均地九·六亩，产量八·六石”，文中“地主”，系老弱孤寡及无劳力的军工属等出租户之误。另所谓富农，除一户系遗漏之封建富农外，余系无劳动力户，新发户及积极村干等。上述各项材料之误引，均系研究材料不够审慎之故，今后当在工作中力加改正，尚希各分社各地读者多提意见，以便改进工作。
