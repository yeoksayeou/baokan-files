　　Use Wisdom to Fight
    Introducing Part Two of "Fear and Courage"
    ·Liu Beigeng·
    The first part of "Fear and Courage" by the Soviet writer Alexander Bek, focused on how the Red Army built and governed its army, while the second part describes how the Panfilov Division fought in the Battle of Moscow, clearly and vividly illustrating a very important idea: "Use wisdom to fight."
    In the autumn of 1941, Hitler's army approached Moscow, and the Panfilov Division was entrusted with a task that concerned the fate of all mankind: to resist the enemy in front of Moscow with a small force, until reinforcements arrived; to buy time, to seize the enemy's time. The Panfilov Division completed this task through continuous combat, shattering Hitler's attempt to occupy Moscow. This book tells us how the Panfilov Division fought through the lens of Baurzhan's battalion.
    "Use wisdom to fight" was a phrase Panfilov liked to say. He taught his officers: "The commander's main responsibility, the main thing, is to think again and again."
    When Panfilov inspected the security line, he asked the soldiers digging the trenches: "What are you using to dig?" He felt that using only shovels was not enough, so Panfilov taught the soldiers: "Use your brains to dig. You have to dig fake positions. Use tactics, deceive the enemy." He said the same to the sentries: "Soldiers must think carefully, soldiers must use their brains to fight."
    Two different examples help us understand that bravery must be combined with wisdom, and victory must be prepared for before the battle. Once, Baurzhan spent a lot of effort planning an ambush, repeatedly studying the situation of both the enemy and ourselves, thinking so hard that he didn't even want to eat. As a result, in the first battle on the highway, the enemy suffered serious casualties from the firepower, and the Donsky platoon killed about a hundred Hitler soldiers. The next day, Baurzhan did not consider that the enemy would learn from their previous mistake. He ordered the Brudny platoon to use the same tactics as yesterday, so the Brudny platoon was driven away by the enemy. In this way, Baurzhan realized that this was due to his own "lack of thinking" before the battle.
    What kind of thinking should be used in combat? Panfilov opposed the passive, purely defensive tactics of being beaten, advocating the use of active, proactive, and flexible offensive tactics. Baurzhan felt unsure about defending an eight-kilometer-long sector with one battalion, and he was prepared to die with the position as a last resort. Panfilov told him not to rush to die, but to learn how to fight, to take preemptive measures, to implement offense, and if necessary, to bring the soldiers out of the trenches to fight. The main thing was to hold the road, not to defend the trenches to the death. This kind of thinking supported Baurzhan, allowing him to not think about how to escape the struggle in extremely difficult circumstances - when the defense line was broken through, when he lost contact with the regimental headquarters, and when the enemy's forces outnumbered his own - but to use every possible means to find the enemy's weaknesses and strike at them. Only by actively attacking could he complete the task of buying time, and only then could the entire battalion fight back to Volokolamsk and join the main force.
    How should soldiers be cared for in wartime? Panfilov said: "We must never ask infantry to fight with their chests out. We must care for the soldiers, not with empty words, but with actions, with firepower." In other words, a commander, when fighting, must know how to use his mind, how to organize and develop his own firepower, inflict serious casualties on the enemy, and reduce his own casualties to a minimum. If you do these things, the soldiers will surely trust you. During the final march of Baurzhan's troops to reunite with the division headquarters, German trucks were constantly speeding on the highway. The terrain was unfavorable to Baurzhan, and they had to pass through a one-kilometer-wide open space. The troops had been operating and marching for a long time without rest, the shells were almost exhausted, there were not many bullets left, and wounded soldiers, vehicles, and artillery needed to be taken care of. Under such unfavorable conditions, Baurzhan did not panic, but was able to use his mind to decide to organize more than seven hundred rifles, using volley fire to prevent the enemy from daring to raise their heads, and the trucks were also shot and ran wildly. Thus, the entire battalion of men, horses, vehicles, and artillery passed through the highway and went straight to Volokolamsk.
    Panfilov was good at summarizing actual war experience and using it to improve the tactical skills of his troops. He said to Baurzhan: "My army is my research institute. This also applies to you, your battalion is your research institute."
    "Fear and Courage" can be regarded as a living "combat regulation," but from its rich ideological content and lively artistic techniques, it is also an excellent realistic military novel. It is of great educational significance to our front-line troops. We have already learned from the first part how to educate troops, how to train troops, and these methods have been proven in actual combat. Its second part will help us to further improve our command art.

### 要用智慧作战  介绍《恐惧与无畏》第二部

　　要用智慧作战
    介绍《恐惧与无畏》第二部
    ·刘备耕·
    苏联别克著的《恐惧与无畏》第一部，着重表现红军怎样建军治军，而它的第二部，则是描写潘菲洛夫部队在保卫莫斯科战争中怎样打仗，明确地生动地说明一个非常重要的思想，这就是“要用智慧作战”。
    一九四一年秋天，希特勒的军队逼近莫斯科，潘菲洛夫师团担负了关系于全人类命运的任务：以少数兵力在莫斯科前面抵挡住敌人，一直抵挡到援军开到；要争取时间，要夺取敌人的时间。潘菲洛夫师团从不间断的作战中，完成了这个任务，把希特勒侵占莫斯科的企图打得粉碎。这本书透过巴武尔章的一个营，告诉我们潘菲洛夫师团是怎样打仗的。
    “要用智慧作战”是潘菲洛夫喜欢说的话，他教导他的干部：“指挥官的主要责任，主要事情就是再三思索。”
    潘菲洛夫视察警戒线，问挖交通壕的战士：“你们用什么挖呢？”他觉得只会用铁锹挖是不够的，因此潘菲洛夫教导战士：“要用脑筋去挖。你们要去挖假阵地。要用计策，要欺骗敌人。”他对岗兵也是这样说：“当兵士的总要好好的想，兵士要用脑筋打仗。”
    有两个不同的例子帮助我们了解，勇敢要同智慧结合，胜利要在战斗前准备。一次巴武尔章为了布置一个伏击，费尽了心机，反复研究敌我双方的情况，想得连饭都不愿吃了，结果公路上第一次战斗，敌人遭受了严重的火力杀伤，顿斯基排打死了一百来个希特勒官兵。第二天，巴武尔章没有设想到敌人上一次当是会学一次乖的，他命令布鲁得内排采取同昨天一样的打法，因而布鲁得内排被敌人打跑了。这样，巴武尔章才体会到这是由于自己在战前“思考少了”造成的过失。
    用什么思想作战呢？潘菲洛夫反对被动的单纯防御的挨打战术，主张采用积极、主动、灵活的进攻战术。一营人要担任八公里长的防御，巴武尔章感到没有把握，万不得已时只好与阵地共存亡。潘菲洛夫告诉他不要急着去死，而要学习打仗，要采取先发制人的手段，实行进攻，必要时应该把战士从战壕里调出来打仗，主要的是守住道路，不必死守住战壕。这种思想支持了巴武尔章，使他在极端困难的情况下，防线被突破，与团部失掉联系，敌人兵力比自己多，他并不想怎样逃脱斗争，而是利用一切可能，寻找敌人弱点打击他，只有积极的出击，才完成了争取时间的任务，也才能使全营打回瓦洛科拉木斯克与主力会师。
    在战时又该怎样爱护兵士呢？潘菲洛夫说：“决不能叫步兵挺胸作战，要爱护兵士，不是空话来爱护，而是用动作，用火力爱护。”换一个说法，就是：一个指挥员，在打仗时，要会用思想，要会组织和发扬自己的火力，给敌人严重杀伤，使自己的伤亡减少到最低限度。做到这些，战士必定信服你。巴武尔章的队伍，最后同师团部会合的进行中，德寇的卡车不断地在公路上奔驶，地形不利于巴武尔章，他们必须通过有一公里宽的平地，部队的长期作战行军得不到休息，炮弹几乎打光了，子弹也不多，伤兵、车辆和大炮等又需照顾。在这样不利条件下，巴武尔章没有慌张，而能用自己的思想决定把七百余支步枪组织起来，以排射打得敌人头都不敢抬起来，卡车也被打得乱跑，于是全营人马车炮通过公路，一直走到瓦洛科拉木斯克。
    潘菲洛夫善于总结实际战争经验，并以此来提高部队的战术素养。他对巴武尔章说：“我的军队，就是我的研究院。这话也是对你说的，你的一营人，就是你的研究院。”
    “恐惧与无畏”，可以看作一本活的“战斗条令”，但从它具有丰满的思想内容和活泼的艺术手法来看，又是一部优秀的写实的军事小说。它对我们前线部队的教育意义极大。我们已经从第一部中学到了如何教育部队，如何训练部队，这些方法并且在实际战斗里已证实了它的力量。它的第二部将要帮助我们指挥艺术的更加提高。
