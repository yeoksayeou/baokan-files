　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 10th: According to a Hong Kong dispatch from the Associated Press on the 9th, General Li Jishen issued a statement condemning Chiang Kai-shek for being directly responsible for the current national crisis in China, and called on followers of Sun Yat-sen's doctrine to rise up and demand reform. The aforementioned statement has been widely published by Chinese newspapers here, criticizing the bankruptcy of China's economy and politics, for which the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, cannot shirk their responsibility. The statement pointed out that a reform program must be implemented, otherwise China will collapse.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 10th: Shanghai News: Northeastern figures Zhou Jingwen, Ning Wu, and Lu Guangsheng sent a letter to Chiang Kai-shek on the 15th of last month, demanding the release of Zhang Xueliang. The letter pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek had broken his promise and violated his word. When Zhang Xueliang was sentenced to ten years in prison by the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek had "personally requested a special pardon from the National Government," but he was two-faced and did not keep his word, placing Zhang Xueliang under "strict supervision" for ten years. Now that the "supervision" has exceeded the term of imprisonment, "legally and reasonably," there is no reason for Zhang Xueliang to remain confined.

　　李济琛谴责蒋介石
    东北民主人士要求释放张学良
    【新华社延安十日电】据合众社香港九日讯：李济琛将军发表声明，谴责蒋介石应对中国目前的国难直接负责，号召孙中山主义的信徒们起来要求改革。上项声明已由此间华文报纸广泛刊载，责难中国经济及政治的破产，以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派不得辞其责。该声明指出改革纲领必须实现，否则中国即将崩溃。
    【新华社延安十日电】沪讯：东北人士周鲸文、宁武、卢广声于上月十五日致函蒋介石，要求释放张学良，函中指出蒋介石背信弃义违背诺言，当张学良被国民政府判处徒刑十年时，蒋介石曾“代呈国府面邀特赦”，但口是心非，说了不算的，把张学良“严加管束”了十年，现在“管束”超过徒刑的期限，“于法于理”，张学良是再没有理由受禁闭的了。
