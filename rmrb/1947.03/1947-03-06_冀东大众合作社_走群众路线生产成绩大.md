　　Jidong Dazhong Cooperative
    Achieves Great Production Results by Following the Mass Line
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 2nd dispatch] The Dazhong Cooperative in the 14th District of Jidong (Pinggu, Miyun, etc.) has achieved results in organizing both official production and mass production by following the mass line. From its establishment in May of last year to the end of the year, the cooperative has earned a profit equivalent to 288,000 jin of rice, completely solving all living expenses and miscellaneous fees for the district-level organization, and developing the mass textile industry. The cooperative's spinning and weaving machines have increased from six to 246, expanding from Pinggu to Shunyi. Due to the development of the textile industry, the people's lives have improved. In Jiagezhuang, with one hundred and several dozen households, the cooperative earned more than 50,000 jin of rice in weaving labor within two months. Wang's family, a poor peasant family of four in Donggaocun, often couldn't eat a single meal of rice a day in the past. After participating in weaving, they now earn an average of eight to nine jin of rice in labor per day, accumulating more than two shi in two months. The reason why the cooperative has achieved the above results is that it has completely followed the mass line, abandoned the official style, utilized social relationships, united private merchants and skilled workers, and solved the problems of cadres, employees, and workers. In terms of business operations, it adopts centralized leadership and decentralized operations, and opens grain stores, flour mills, iron and wood factories, etc. according to the needs of the masses, thus gaining deep support from the masses.

　　冀东大众合作社
    走群众路线生产成绩大
    【新华社晋绥二日电】冀东十四分区（平谷密云等地）大众合作社，走群众路线，在组织机关生产与群众生产方面，都有成绩。合作社自去年五月成立至年底，已获利计米二十八万八千斤，完全解决了分区一级机关的全部生活及公杂费，并发展了群众的纺织业。该社纺、织机由六架发展到二百四十六架，在地区上由平谷发展到顺义一带。由于纺织业的发展，群众生活因之提高，一百几十户的贾各庄，两月由合作社赚得纺织手工米五万余斤。东高村贫农王家妻女四人，过去常是一天吃不上一顿米饭，参加纺织后，每天平均赚手工米八九斤，两月积下了两石。该社所以获得上述成绩，是由于一切通过群众路线，放下机关作风，利用社会关系，团结了私商及技术工人，解决了干部职员与工人问题。在经营方式上，采用集中领导分散经营，并根据群众需要，开设粮行、面厂、铁木工厂等，因之深得群众赞助。
