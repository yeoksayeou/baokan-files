Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: United Press International, Shanghai, March 1st: The China Liberated Areas Relief Association telegraphed Rooks, Director-General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Washington, at 9:00 AM on the 1st, protesting the Chiang government's house arrest of Dong Biwu, Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, and Wu Yunfu, the representative of the Association stationed at the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party. The telegram demanded the immediate restoration of their freedom of movement. The Relief Association stated that although the Chiang government had demanded that all Communist personnel withdraw completely by March 5th, the Relief Association was not prepared to end its work. It pointed out that if the Relief Association were closed, the distribution of UNRRA relief supplies to the Liberated Areas would come to an end. Recently, UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) agreed to allocate 15,000 tons of relief supplies to the Liberated Areas each month. In its telegram to Rooks, the Relief Association requested that the Chiang government guarantee the safety of all Relief Association staff.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: Dong Biwu, Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, telegraphed General Rooks, Director-General of UNRRA in Washington, and the UNRRA Central Committee on February 19th, through Egerton, Director of the UNRRA China Office, protesting the UNRRA Central Committee's special meeting scheduled for February 24th to consider the Chiang government's request to sell relief supplies worth US$200 million on the black market. The protest stated: The China Liberated Areas Relief Association firmly opposes this proposal. The Chiang government's plan actually means that the people and refugees in war-torn areas, especially the Liberated Areas, will no longer be able to receive relief, and it will fuel the current attacks on the Liberated Areas. We are deeply regretful that UNRRA, which has an obligation to help the suffering Chinese people, is even considering such a proposal! We hope you will convey to General Rooks and the Committee that we fundamentally disapprove of this plan. We believe that UNRRA should insist on sending these supplies to the Liberated Areas, where it is guaranteed that the supplies will not be sold and will be used entirely to relieve the people who truly suffered during the War of Resistance Against Japan, rather than considering selling the supplies on the black market.
This newspaper's Jiluyu dispatch, March 3rd: UNRRA representative Hanson, CRRRA representative Wang Hechen, and others, were retreating towards Kaifeng on the 20th of last month. While crossing the river at Puyang County, they were subjected to heavy bombing by Chiang's aircraft. Three UNRRA trucks were destroyed, and Hanson and others narrowly escaped being hit. All destroyed vehicles were clearly marked with UNRRA insignia. Unable to pass through the Chiang aircraft's blockade line, they returned to Zhangqiu on February 26th. Hanson and others expressed extreme indignation at the Chiang side's destruction of relief work and obstruction of the evacuation of relief personnel, and have reported the bombing incident to UNRRA, stating: "We are dodging bombing all day, and business cannot be conducted. We will take the route of Linqing and Tianjin to return to Shanghai."

    抗议蒋介石软禁董必武同志
    冀鲁豫联总代表遭蒋机轰炸无法撤退
    【新华社延安三日电】合众社上海一日电：中国解放区救济总会于一日晨九时致电华盛顿联总署长鲁克斯，抗议蒋政府软禁解总主席董必武及一行驻行总代表伍云甫于上海中共办事处。该电要求立即恢复其行动自由。解总表示：尽管蒋政府要求中共人员于三月五日前完全撤退，但解总并未准备结束。并指出：解总如关闭，联总对解放区救济物资之分配将告结束。而最近联继、行总会允许每月以救济物资一万五千吨分配予解放区。解总于其致鲁克斯电文中，要求蒋政府应保证所有解总工作人员之安全。
    【新华社延安三日电】中国解放区救济总会主席董必武氏，曾于二月十九日经联总驻华办事处长艾格顿致电华盛顿联总署长鲁克斯将军及联总中委会，抗议联总中央委员会将于二月二十四日召开特别会议，考虑蒋政府所提欲将价值二亿美元之救济物资在黑市出售之请求。抗议称：中国解放区救济总会坚决反对此提议，蒋政府此项计划实际意味着遭受战祸地区之人民及难民，尤其是解放区，将再不可能得到救济，并将助长目前对解放区之进攻。我们并以帮助受难的中国人民为义务的联总，竟欲召开会议研究如此之提议，深为遗憾！希望你向鲁克斯将军及委员会传达，我们根本不赞成这一计划。我们认为联总与其考虑将物资出售于黑市，不如坚持将此项物资送至解放区，那里保证物资不会出卖，而完全用于救济那些在抗日战争中真正受难的人民。
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】联总代表韩森、行总代表王贺宸等，于上月二十日向开封撤退，路经濮县渡河时，遭蒋机大肆轰击，联总卡车被击毁三辆，韩森等险被击中。被毁之汽车均涂有联总显明标歼，渠等因无法通过蒋机封锁线，遂于二月二十六日折返张秋。韩森等对于蒋方如此破坏救济工作，又阻挠救济人员撤退，表示万分愤慨，已将此次被炸经过报告联总谓：“终日躲轰炸，业务无法进行，将取道临清、天津返沪”。
