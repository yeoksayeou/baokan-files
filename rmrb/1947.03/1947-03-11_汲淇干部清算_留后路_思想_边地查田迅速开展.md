　　The Jiji County [汲淇县], west of the Pinghan [Pingjin-Hankou] Railway in northern Henan, launched a land investigation and a campaign to help people stand up on their feet at the beginning of last month, to make up for what was lacking. In the border areas where the struggle against the enemy is intense, many villages have also begun their fight for liberation. The movement was launched after crushing the "the world might change" mentality, especially after correcting the "leaving a way out" mentality among cadres. At the beginning of last month, when the first district convened a meeting of village cadres and activists, most cadres believed that "the big landlords have run away, and the small landlords are almost done," resisting the effort to make up for what was lacking by saying that "there are loopholes, but no loose ends [to tie up]". After calling for self-reflection, it was discovered that cadres had a serious fear of "the world changing" and a "leaving a way out" mentality. The district is close to the border area, and many of the local bullies and traitors who had been purged are in the "Homecoming Corps". When Chiang's special agents raided the area at the end of last October, many cadres in Xuebaizhuang Village [雪白庄村] were captured by the "Homecoming Corps," which caused the village cadres to dare not distribute the property confiscated from the local tyrant Yan Yude [阎玉德] to this day, and even to protect the landlords. At the meeting, cadres were educated with the example of Xuebaizhuang Village: the cadres of that village thought they had a way out, were paralyzed by Chiang Kai-shek's regime, and suffered a great loss when the enemy came and did not transfer; on the contrary, other villages did not leave a way out, resolutely carried out guerrilla warfare when Chiang's regime swept through, and suffered no losses. This made all the cadres realize that "leaving a way out" is actually a dead end, and only struggle is the way to survive. After the cadres' thinking was cleared, they went back to the villages to make connections, and at the same time paid attention to mobilizing the backward elements. A large number of feudal remnants and air-raid shelters were unearthed, and the movement quickly moved towards a climax. According to the county leadership, the experience of the first district is that in the "double investigation," one should first investigate the loopholes; when the "loophole households" are awakened, the feudal remnants will have no way to hide. In the border areas, to break the "the world might change" mentality, it is necessary to combine current affairs education with class education to inspire the masses' will to struggle. At the same time, it is necessary to organize guerrilla warfare to fully support the masses politically and militarily.

　　汲淇干部清算“留后路”思想
    边地查田迅速开展
    【本报太行九日电】豫北平汉西侧汲淇县于上月初展开了查田查翻身的填补运动。对敌斗争紧张的边地，不少村庄也开始了翻身斗争。运动是在粉碎变天思想，特别是纠正了干部中的“留后路”思想后开展的。上月初，一区召开村干部与积极分子会时，大部干部均认为“大地主跑了，小地主差不多了”，以“有窟窿，没尾巴”，抵抗填补。号召反省后，发现干部中有严重的怕“变天”“留后路”思想。该区接近边地，恶霸地主与被清算的奸特多在还乡团中，去年十月底蒋特奔袭该地，雪白庄村干部即被还乡团俘走甚多，致使该村干部对没收恶霸阎玉德的财产，至今不敢分配，甚至有掩护地主现象。经会上以雪白庄例子教育干部：该村干部因自以为留有后路，对蒋伪麻痹，敌来不转移就吃了大亏；相反其他村庄不留后路，蒋伪扫荡时坚决开展游击战，未受损失。使全体干部认识了“留后路”实际上是死路，只有斗争是活路。干部思想打通后，即回村串通，同时注意发动落后层，大批封建尾巴与防空洞始被发掘出来，运动即迅速走向高潮。据该县领导上谈：一区的经验“双查”中应首先查窟窿，窟窿户觉悟，封建尾巴即无法隐蔽。在边地要打破“变天”，必须时事教育与阶级教育结合，启发群众斗争意志。同时须组织游击战争，在政治与武装上充分给群众撑腰作主。
