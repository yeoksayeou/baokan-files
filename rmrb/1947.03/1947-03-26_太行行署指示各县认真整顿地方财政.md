Taihang Administrative Office Directs All Counties to Conscientiously Rectify Local Finances

[From our newspaper in Taihang, the 23rd] After summarizing past experiences in local financial work, the Taihang Administrative Office recently issued instructions for a general rectification of local finances. The instructions emphasized breaking down departmentalism in financial work, establishing a sense of the overall situation, improving local finances, and fully supporting the front lines. 1. Strictly distinguish between the three levels of financial management: the border region, the county, and the village. After the masses have been emancipated and their awareness has been raised, each county should conduct a general mass investigation of public grain from the past. 2. Closely integrate financial management with market management, and organize indirect income such as transaction fees to reduce the burden on the people. However, no fees may be collected except for transactions involving grain and livestock. 3. Promote the experience of combining financial rectification with local construction. For example, Xiangyuan County can extract a portion of local grain funds to directly operate coal kilns, or other counties can lend a certain amount of local grain funds to cooperatives, providing loans to support production. Or invest in production ventures. 4. Implement a scientific and democratic management system. Local finances, especially village finances, must be absolutely transparent, and the masses must be mobilized to manage their own affairs. 5. Reduce the social burden on the people. According to a survey of six villages, the burden of expenses such as supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, cultural entertainment, public construction, and militia equipment accounts for 26.4% of the border region's grain. There is a great deal of waste involved, and strict management and thrift must be enforced in the future. Necessary construction costs should be included in the formal expenditures of village finances for assessment purposes.

    太行行署指示各县认真整顿地方财政
    【本报太行廿三日电】太行行署于总结过去地方财政工作经验后，特于日前发出普遍整顿地方财政指示。强调打破财政工作上的本位主义，树立全局思想，改进地方财政，全力支援前线。一、严格分清边、县、村三级财政管理制度。各县在群众翻身后觉悟提高的基础上，应普遍进行一次对过去公粮群众性的清查。二、与管理市场密切结合，组织交易手续费等间接收入，以减轻人民负担。但除粮食、牲口交易外，其余一律不能征收。三、发扬整顿财政与地方建设结合的经验。如襄垣抽出一部地方粮款直接经营煤窑，或如其它县以一定地方粮款贷放给合作社，整放零取使起贷款扶助生产的作用。或投资生产事业。四、实行科学民主的管理制度，地方财政特别是村财政绝对公开，发动群众大家当家。五、减轻人民社会负担。根据六个村调查，拥军优军、文化娱乐、公共建筑、民兵装备等费用的负担，竟占边区粮食的百分之二六点四。其中浪费甚大，今后必须加以严格管理、厉行节约。必要的建设费列入村财政正式开支以内，以便考核。
