Welcoming "March 8th" Women's Day

Today is the second "March 8th" Women's Day since Japan's surrender. A year ago, women compatriots across the country commemorated our own festival with great joy and anticipation. At that time, the ceasefire order had been issued, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference had been reached, and the "guarantee of women's equality in political, social, educational, and economic status" and the early nation-building program had been announced. The Chinese women, who had been oppressed for thousands of years, saw light and hope before them. They thought that the untold disasters and sacrifices suffered in the eight-year war of resistance could finally end and be exchanged for an independent, peaceful, democratic, and happy life. However, all these reasonable and legitimate hopes were shattered by American imperialism and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek. In the past year or so, with the support of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek has thoroughly destroyed the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, letting go and waging a civil war, and strengthening fascist dictatorship, causing the Chinese people to continue to suffer in deep water and scorching fire. First, it is the women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who have suffered the humiliation of the American army and the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's opposition group. And recently, American imperialism is still attempting to keep American troops stationed in China for a long time, and further taking various forms to step up aid to Chiang. Chiang Kai-shek, under this aid, is desperately expanding the civil war and intensifying the offensive against Yan'an again. He has occupied Malan, the capital of the Guanzhong sub-district, and fierce battles are unfolding in eastern Gansu, to show his determination to completely break with peace and close the door to peace. This will obviously cause more serious devastation and damage to the people of the whole country, especially women compatriots, and plunge the Chinese nation into an unprecedented disaster!

At the beginning of the serious situation, all Chinese women must unite more closely, mobilize, and, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the reactionary ruling group of Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism's enslavement and colonization of the Chinese people. In the struggle for national independence, liberation, and the people's democratic freedom, Chinese women are by no means the docile sheep imagined by the reactionaries; on the contrary, they are a very important and powerful force in striving for the independence, peace, democracy, and freedom and liberation of the motherland. In the past year, the vast number of women compatriots in Chiang Kai-shek's ruling areas have participated in various anti-war and anti-civil war movements (such as the 100,000-person anti-civil war parade in Shanghai in June last year, where women accounted for six-tenths of the participants), and opposed "anti-communism and anti-Sovietism" (such as the Chongqing women's memorial meeting on "March 8th" last year, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China), especially after the case of American troops insulting female students at Peking University, the patriotic movement that surged up across the country showed the spirit of their heroic struggle and unleashed great power. In the Liberated Areas, they have shown brilliant achievements in the patriotic self-defense war for the motherland. They enthusiastically participated in various logistical tasks of the self-defense war. Due to their great enthusiasm for the cause of the motherland and their own liberation, they mobilized their husbands and sons to join the People's Liberation Army by the thousands, while they themselves took the place of men to step up production, and some even participated in and led the militia guerrillas. Millions of poor women in various Liberated Areas have shown themselves to be seeking liberation in the land reform and emancipation movement... [Missing text]...emerged many new women heroes. After the emancipation struggle, the awareness of the broad masses of women has been greatly raised, their economic and social status has also been greatly improved, and women's organizations have developed greatly. Now, all the Liberated Areas are showing a new atmosphere of family harmony and diligent production. They will unite with greater strength to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!

The women of the Liberated Areas must first use their greatest efforts to support the great patriotic self-defense war. We must learn from the glorious examples of Gao Fengying in central Jiangsu and Liu Hulan in Shanxi, and lead the broad masses of women to wage a struggle against the enemy to the death; we must more enthusiastically launch the army recruitment movement, mobilize patriotic young men to join the army and go to the front to fight the enemy; women must more wholeheartedly sew clothes and make shoes for the soldiers, comfort the wounded and sick, and participate in all war-related hard work, in order to support and assist the People's Liberation Army. Today, Chiang Kai-shek has once again launched an offensive against the Shaanxi-Gansu border region and Yan'an. All the women in the border region should quickly mobilize, everything for the front line, everything for the victory of defending the border region, defending Yan'an, working nervously and tirelessly, in order to completely smash the offensive of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan!

Another major task for the broad masses of women in the Liberated Areas today is to more actively participate in land reform. The status of women themselves is a measure of social development and social change. The experience of the past year has proved that the more working women participate and the higher their enthusiasm, the more thorough the land reform will be carried out. All poor women in the Liberated Areas should learn from the mother of Li Fengniu, the "speaking bitterness leader", should enthusiastically participate in the liquidation and speaking bitterness struggle, oppose talking about feelings and personal relationships with those who oppress them and resolutely demand the return of their lifeline – the land. The liquidation committees and land committees in various places should absorb as many women activists as possible to participate, and the women's federations in various places should rely on the new activists who have emerged in the land reform to "connect" and expand the women's masses, seek their own development, and also use vivid examples of struggle to educate and improve women's political awareness. In particular, we should pay attention to the fact that we must quickly organize women to participate in the spring plowing movement on the basis of land reform, and strive to take over men's labor and better develop production. Women are the main force in organizing industries. In order to win the victory of the self-defense war and improve the lives of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, we must work harder to develop the organization movement and truly achieve that every household spins thread and every village weaves cloth. This production army is of great importance to the final victory of our self-defense war and the consolidation of the fruits of land reform.

The entire mobilization of women in the Liberated Areas to achieve the three tasks: participation in the war, land reform, and the production movement, the purpose is to oppose the aggression of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship, is for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland and for their own liberation, is to help the women compatriots in Chiang Kai-shek's ruling areas who are now suffering and are fighting heroically. All patriotic women in China unite! Fight to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang offensive, fight for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland! We bravely advance, persevere in our struggle, we must win, and our victory will surely come soon.

### 迎“三八”妇女节

　　迎“三八”妇女节
    今天是日本投降后的第二个“三八”节。一年前，全国女同胞曾经以十分欢喜与期待的心情，纪念我们自己的节日，当时停战令已经颁发，政协决议已经达成，“保证妇女在政治上、社会上、教育上、经济上地位之平等”的和早建国纲领已经通过相公布，几千年来被压迫的中国妇女面前显出了光明和希望。她们以为在八年抗战中遭受的说不尽的灾难和牺牲从此可以终结，可以换来独立和平民主幸福的生活了。但是，所有这一切合理与此的希望，却被美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石撕个粉碎。一年多来，蒋介石在美国帝国主义的支持下，彻底破坏了停战令与政协决议，放手大打内战，加强法西斯独裁，使中华人民依然在水深火热中熬煎。首先是国民党区的妇女，她们受尽了美军的凌辱和蒋介石反对集团的压迫。而最近，美帝国主义仍然企图在中国长期留驻美军，并进一步采取多种形式加紧援蒋，商蒋介石就在这种援助之下，正在拚命的扩大内战，再度加紧发动进攻延安，已占领了关中分区首府马栏，陇东正展开激战，以表示其决心全面决裂到的，关死和平之门。这显然将使全国人民、首先是妇女同胞遭受更严重的摧残与损害，陷中国民族于空前的灾难中！
    在严重局势的开头，全中国妇女要更加团结起来，动员起来，和全国人民一起，坚决反对蒋介石反动统治集团及美国帝国主义奴役中国人民，殖民地化中国。在为民族独立解放与人民的民主自由的斗争中，中国妇女决非反动派所想像出来顺的绵羊；正相反，她们是争取祖国独立和平民主与自由解放的一支十分重要与强大的力量。一年以来，蒋介石统治区的广大妇女同胞，曾经在历次的反战内战（如去年六月上海十万人反内战进行参加者，妇女占十分之六），反对“反共反苏”（如去年“三八”节重庆妇女纪念大会，要求美军退出中国，特别在美军窜污北大女同学案发生以后，全国风起云涌的爱国运动中使美及其英勇的斗争气概，发极大的力量。在解放区，对祖国的爱国自卫战争更表现了光辉的成绩，她们踊跃地参加自卫战争各项后勤工作。由于她们对祖国与自身解放事业的伟大的热忱，她们动员自己的丈夫儿子成千成万的参加人民解放军，她们自己则代潜男子加紧生产，有的甚至自己参加和领导民兵游击队。各解放区千百万贫苦妇女在土地改革翻身运动中，更显得是自求解放的………（中缺十余字）涌现出许多新的妇女英雄。经过翻身斗争，广大妇女的觉悟大大提高了，她们的经济地位与社会地位亦大大提高了，妇女的组织大大发展了，如今各解放区是一片家庭和睦勤劳生产的新气象，她们将团结得更有力量，以粉碎蒋介石的进攻！
    解放区的妇女，首先要用最大的努力支援伟大的爱国自卫战争。我们要学习苏中高风英和晋刘湖兰的光荣范例，领导广大妇女和敌人作誓死不屈的斗争；我们要更加热烈地展开参军运动，动员爱国好男儿去参军、上前线打敌人；妇女们要更加尽心竭力地为战士们缝衣做鞋，慰问伤病员，参加一切战争勤劳工作，以支援与协助人民解放军。今天蒋介石已经再一次发动了向陕甘边区和延安的攻势，全边区妇女应迅速动员起来，一切为着前线，一切为了保卫边区、保卫延安的胜利、紧张和毫不疲倦地工作，以彻底粉碎蒋介石、胡宗南的进攻！
    解放区广大妇女今天另一个重大任务，是更加积极地参加土地改革。妇女的自身是社会发展与社会变革的尺度。一年来的经验证明，劳动妇女参加的人数较多、积极性越高，土地改革便进行得越彻底。解放区一切贫苦妇女，应该向沉重的“诉苦领导”李风牛的母亲学习，应该热烈参加清算诉苦斗争，反对和封建压迫着讲感情要私情，坚决地要回自己的命根子——土地。各地的清算委员会、土地委员会应该尽量吸收妇女积极分子参加，各地妇联制依靠在土地改革中涌现出来的新积极分子来“串连”扩大妇女群众求得自己的发展、也用斗争的生动实例进行教育，提高妇女的政治觉悟，特别应该注意我们要在土地改革的基础上迅速组织妇女参加春耕运动，要紧张地接替男子的劳力，更好地发展生产。妇女们是要组织业的主力，为了争取自卫战争的胜利和提高解放区军民的生活，要更加努力开展组织运动，真正做到家家纺线，村村织布。这支生产大军是与我们自卫战的最后胜利和巩固土地改革的果实有重大的关系的。
    解放区妇女全体动员起来实现第三个任务：参战、土地改革和生产运动、目的就是为了反对美国帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石的卖国独裁，就是为了祖国的独立和平民主和为了自己的解放？就是为了援助蒋介石统治区现在受尽苦难和正在英勇奋斗的妇女同胞。全中国的爱国妇女团结起来！为战胜蒋介石国民党的进攻而战，为祖国的独立和平民主而战！我们勇敢的进军，坚持的奋斗，我们一定要胜利，我们的胜利不会很久就一定到来了。
