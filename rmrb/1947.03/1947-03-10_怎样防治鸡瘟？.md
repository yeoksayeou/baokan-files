　　How to Prevent and Cure Chicken Plague?
To the Editor:
    The chicken plague (epidemic chicken disease) in the Shili Dian area of Wu'an is quite severe, and the masses are at a loss, resulting in significant losses in sideline production. The symptoms of the chickens are that their combs turn black or purple, their wings and tails droop, they walk with a limp, their mouths secrete yellow fluid, and they have diarrhea. Please quickly introduce some prevention and treatment methods and publish them in the newspaper. Sincerely,
               Reader Xiao Ming

Comrade Xiao Ming:
    The chicken disease you mentioned is chicken plague. The source of the disease is a filterable toxin that exists in the blood, nervous system, secretions, and excrement of diseased chickens. Healthy chickens will be infected if they come into contact with diseased chickens, their excrement, or their coops (chicken nests).
    Chicken plague is difficult to cure, so prevention is very important. The following are several prevention methods: (1) People who feed diseased chickens can also transmit the disease to healthy chickens. It is best not to keep healthy chickens and diseased chickens together. (2) Chicken coops should be placed in high, dry, and sunny locations. It is best to sprinkle some lime inside the coop and clean it regularly to keep it clean. (3) Chicken feed should also be clean, and they should not be allowed to eat rotten food. Give them clean water to drink every day. Adding some salt to the feed when feeding can enhance the chickens' resistance and aid digestion. Or feed them two li of sulfur every day to break down blood clots. (4) Regularly check the chickens for disease. If a chicken is found to be sick, kill it quickly. When a diseased chicken dies, it should be buried deeply in the ground (three feet or more) along with its feathers. Confine the healthy chickens and prevent them from running around outside.
    If the chickens are in the early stages of the disease, there are several treatment methods: (1) Feeding them some garlic can both prevent and treat the disease (garlic has bactericidal properties). (2) Mix kerosene and flour, roll them into rice-grain-sized pieces, and feed them to the chickens. Or drench them with alum water, twice a day, one tablespoon each time. (3) Grind one grain of croton into powder, add two qian of vegetable oil, and drench the diseased chicken. (4) Use one fen of Sichuan pepper, two fen of Gansui earth, two fen of gentian (available in pharmacies), and add lard to make pills to feed the chickens. (5) When the chicken is first sick, cut open its neck, pour out the contents, wash the mucus inside with water, and then sew it up with needle and thread. (6) Mix equal parts of chili powder, mung bean flour, and turpentine (available in pharmacies), mix well, make into pills, and feed one or two pills every two hours. (7) Drench them with sesame oil twice, or drench them with six or seven drops of hemp oil. (8) Prick the chicken's feet and wing joints with a needle to make it bleed, and then drench it with a little wine. You may as well try these folk methods.

　　怎样防治鸡瘟？编辑同志：
    武安十里店一带，鸡灾（鸡的流行性病）相当严重，群众束手无策，对副业生产损失很大。鸡的症状是鸡冠呈黑或紫，两翅和尾下垂，走动颠跛，嘴流黄水，拉稀屎。请你们赶快介绍一些防御和治疗的方法，登报宣传为荷。此致敬礼！                                       
               读者晓明晓明同志：
    你所谈的鸡病，是鸡瘟，病源是由于一种滤过性的毒素，存在于病鸡的血液、神经系、分泌物和排泄物中，好鸡接触了病鸡或病鸡排泄物和病鸡住舍（鸡窝），都会传染。
    鸡瘟很难治好，所以预先防止是很重要的，预防法有以下几种：（一）喂病鸡的人再喂好鸡也可以传染。最好不让好鸡与病鸡放在一起。（二）鸡窝要安置在高处、干燥、向阳的地方，窝内最好撒些石灰，经常打扫保持清洁。（三）鸡的饲料也要干净，不让它吃腐烂东西，每天给它些干净水喝。在喂时，放点食盐在饲料内，可以增强鸡的抵抗力，又可助消化。或每天喂它二厘硫磺，可以溃血。（四）经常检查鸡是否有病，如果发现那只鸡有病，就赶快把它杀掉。病鸡死了，应连羽毛深埋到三尺以下的土中。好鸡关起来，不让它们在外乱跑。
    鸡如果是初病，有以下几种治法：（一）喂它一些蒜，既可预防，又可治疗（蒜有杀菌力）。（二）煤油和面粉，搓成米粒大、喂吃。或灌明矾水，一天两次，一次一汤匙。（三）用巴豆一粒研成碎末，再放入植物油二钱，给病鸡灌下。（四）用大花椒一分、甘子土二分、龙胆草（药铺有）二分，再加上猪油合成丸子去喂鸡。（五）鸡初病时，把脖子用刀割开，把里面的东西倒出来，再用水将里面的粘液洗净，然后用针线缝好。（六）辣椒末、绿豆面和松节（药铺有）各等份，调匀做成丸子每隔两小时喂一二粒。（七）灌香油两次，或灌大麻油六七滴也可。（八）用针扎鸡脚和翅膀拐，使它流出血来，再灌一点酒就行了。以上这些土法，大家不防试试。
