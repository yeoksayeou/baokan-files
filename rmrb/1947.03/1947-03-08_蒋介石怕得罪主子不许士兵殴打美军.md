【This newspaper's report from the frontlines of Ji-Lu-Yu, 5th】 American soldiers stationed in China are helping Chiang's army wage civil war, and their actions of insulting our compatriots have aroused hatred among Chiang's soldiers. In recent battles, our army seized telegram number 7810 from Kang Dezi of Chiang's newly formed 21st Division, which stated: "According to the Committee's Wei Yang Ban San Yi telegram: This Committee has repeatedly received reports from the American side stating: 'Nationalist' troops often have incidents of beating 'Allied' soldiers, which will not only hinder our friendly Sino-American cooperative relationship, but will also directly affect combat capability. It is hoped that all subordinate units will be ordered to refrain from beating them under any pretext. If such incidents occur, the units must be held responsible." American soldiers bully Chinese soldiers in our major cities, beat rickshaw pullers, run over pedestrians, rape female students... Chiang Kai-shek's government not only turns a blind eye but also tries its best to cover up for its masters. When Chinese soldiers, out of hatred, beat American soldiers, Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered his subordinates to "be held responsible," acting as a slave worshipping his master, which is the height of shamelessness!

　　蒋介石怕得罪主子不许士兵殴打美军
    【本报冀鲁豫前线五日电】驻华美军帮助蒋军进行内战，侮辱我国同胞之行为，在蒋军内部亦已引起士兵之仇恨。我军在最近战斗中缴获蒋军新编第二十一师康德字第七八一○号之代电，该电称：“按奉委座未养办三一电开：本会迭据美方报称：‘国军’部队，往往有殴打‘盟军’之事件发生，此不但有碍吾中美合作友好之关系，并将直接影响于作战能力。希即饬所属各部队，不得再有借故殴打情形。如有此事件发生，各部队须负责任。”美军在我各大城市欺侮中国兵士，殴打车夫、轧死路人、强奸女学生………，蒋介石政府不但置若罔闻，且为其主子百般掩护。中国士兵由于仇恨，殴打美军，蒋介石却亲饬所属“须负责任”，入主祀奴，无耻之尤！
