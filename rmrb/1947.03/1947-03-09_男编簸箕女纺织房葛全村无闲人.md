[This article transmitted by] This newspaper's Jinnan office, 7th [of March]. Yuanzhao First District's Fangge Village has seen rising living standards for its farmers after land reform and vigorous production. Fangge Village is a small, impoverished village of just over 40 households, totaling less than 200 people, cultivating a little over 7 liang of barren land. Just outside the east gate lies a sandy hollow, and there wasn't a single brick house in the entire village. After several struggles for emancipation, the people shook off feudal oppression, and their enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented heights. Last winter, there was not a single idle person in the entire village. Most of the villagers know how to weave winnows; 42 people in the village were weavers, and the elderly or children who couldn't weave helped by making warp threads and strips. From October to the end of last year, the village earned over one million yuan. Fang Yitian, over 50 years old, fearing that there wouldn't be oxen to plow the fields in the spring, redoubled his efforts, weaving until midnight every day. In 27 days, he earned enough to buy a half-grown ox worth 60,000 yuan. Forty-five women in Fangge Village participated in an organized women's spinning mutual aid group of twenty people. From last autumn to the end of the year, they wove more than 200 zhang of cloth. Besides supplying the village's needs, they sold over 100 zhang, earning a total profit of over 500,000 yuan. Each member of the mutual aid group received a dividend of 10,000 yuan, 5 zhang of cloth, and 2 jin of cotton. Except for the elderly, there wasn't a single idle woman in the entire village. Even 9-year-old girl, Gailian, learned to spin and gin cotton; it truly deserves the name of "Weaving and Plaiting Village." The entire village, men and women, plunged into production. Since last autumn, the number of livestock in the village has increased from four to twenty-three, and more than a dozen good houses with brick foundations have been built. Now another five or six families have bought bricks, tiles, and timber, preparing to build houses this spring. Everyone in the village is wearing brand new clothes, and most families are eating yellow rice, vermicelli, and cabbage. The farmers of this village cannot help but sing happily: "Led to emancipation and production, we have food to eat and clothes to wear. If you ask who gave us this time, our hearts are filled with gratitude to Chairman Mao."

　　男编簸箕女纺织房葛全村无闲人
    【本报冀南七日电】元朝一区房葛村，经过土地改革和积极生产，农民生活上升。房葛村是一个四十来户的小穷村，总共不足二百口人、种着七两多不毛之地，一出东门就是沙窝，全村没有一座砖房。经过几次的翻身斗争，人民摆脱了封建压迫，生产情绪空前高涨。去冬全村没有一个闲人，该村大都会编簸箕，全村编者四十二人，不会编的老人或小孩打经子、打条子。自去年十月至年底，全村赚洋百余万元，五十多岁的房义田，怕春天没牛耕地，就加劲每天编到半夜，廿七天的工夫就赚了个价值六万元的半大牛。房葛村四十五个妇女参加组织，成立了二十人的妇纺互助社。自去年秋后至年底，织了二百多丈布，除供本村穿外，还售出百余丈，共得利五十余万元；互助社每人分利一万元、五丈布、二斤花。除老人外，全村没有一个闲着的妇女，连九岁女孩改莲，也学会了纺花、轧花，真不亏叫作“织编庄”。全村男女卷入了生产，从去年秋后算起，全村四头牲口，增至二十三头，修下了十几间有砖基的好房。现在又有五六家买下了砖瓦、木材等准备今春盖房。全村人都穿上暂新的衣服，大多数人家都是吃的黄米饭、粉条、白菜。该村农民不无愉快的歌唱：“领导翻身和生产，咱们有吃又有穿，要问时光谁给的，心中感谢毛主席。”
