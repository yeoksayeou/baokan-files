    Proactively Organize Incursions Behind Enemy Lines
    Qin South Establishes Consolidated Base Area
    Entire Area North of Meng-Qin Highway Under Our Control
    [Our newspaper Taihang dispatch, 19th] The situation behind enemy lines in Qinyang, south of the Daoqing Railway, has taken on a new look. At the beginning of the year, when county and district cadres gathered to study the future struggle against the enemy, the county committee put forward the slogan "Defend Qin North, Develop Qin South." However, at that time, the enemies in Shuibeiguan and Bo'ai, north of the Qin River, still frequently harassed us, and the second and third districts along the eastern bank of the Dan River were often in a state of combat readiness. The fourth and fifth districts of Qin South were guerrilla areas, while the sixth and seventh districts of the city were entirely controlled by the enemy. In January, we proactively organized incursions behind enemy lines, and within a month, we transformed a turbulent area into a consolidated base area. The fourth and fifth districts of Qin South became relatively consolidated base areas, and most of the first, sixth, and seventh districts were under our control. Because we established contact with the broad masses behind enemy lines, the enemy only harassed us twice in the fourth and fifth months, one of which was intercepted by our guerrilla forces, who left more than ten corpses behind and fled. In mid-February, the county committee again proposed: "Consolidate the north of the road, develop the east of the road (referring to the east of the Meng-Qin Highway), and strive to gain a foothold in the east of the road by the end of March." After the meeting, the secretary of the county committee personally led the battalion soldiers, armed work teams, and public security plainclothes teams across the east of the road. On the night of February 24, the entire puppet Da Township Office of Xiwangtai (equivalent to a district office below the county level) was wiped out, and Da Township Chief Li Fulin and more than ten people including the Da Township Captain were captured alive, and a number of long and short guns were seized. After entering March, the sixth and seventh districts of the city (except for the four gates) and the area east of the Meng (County) Qin Highway have been brought under our control. Under the extension of the power of our guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, most of the puppet Bao chiefs and landlords have taken the initiative to contact us. A certain village Bao chief and landlord in the sixth district held a meeting together to discuss contacting us, saying: If we offer money, we are afraid that the Eighth Route Army will not want it; if we send grain, the traces will be too obvious; finally, it was decided to send thirty bolts of cloth to the democratic government.

    主动组织敌后出击
    沁南建立巩固根据地
    孟沁公路以北全部为我掌握
    【本报太行十九日电】道清路南之沁阳敌后形势，已呈新局面。年初全县县区干部集会研究今后对敌斗争时，县委会即提出“保卫沁北，开展沁南”的口号，但当时沁河以北水北关与博爱敌人仍常出骚扰，沿丹河东畔之二、三两区则常处于备战状态，沁南四、五两区为游击区，城关之六、七区，则全为敌控制。一月份我主动组织敌后出击，一个月中，即变动荡区为巩固根据地。沁南四、五两区变为比较巩固之根据地，一、六、七区大部为我掌握。由于我与敌后广大群众取得连系，故四、五两月内敌只出扰两次，其中一次被我游击部队截击，遗尸十余具逃走。二月中旬，县委会又提出：“巩固路北、开展路东（指孟沁公路以东），争取三月底在路东生根立足。”会毕，县委书记便亲自带领营兵、武工队、公安便衣队越过路东。二月二十四日夜，即将西王台伪大乡公所（相当县以下的区公所）全部歼灭，活捉大乡长李福林，大乡队长等以下十余人，缴长短枪一部。进入三月后，城关之六、七区（除四关外）及孟（县）沁公路以东地区，已经为我掌握。在我敌后游击战威力伸展下，大部伪保长、地主已与我主动接头。六区某村保长和地主在一起开会讨论与我接头事，说：上货吧（送钱）又怕八路军不要；送粮食吧，形迹太大；最后决定给民主政府送来三十匹布。
