Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Newspaper reports from various locations reveal that since last winter, the Chiang Kai-shek government has been carrying out large-scale military-style plunder and annexation of people's land across the country. These enterprises, under the so-called American-style mechanization, aim to achieve the complete control of Chinese agriculture through the combination of Chiang's bureaucratic capital and American financial power.

It is reported that the specific methods used by the Chiang government to plunder people's land are twofold: first, to openly encroach upon and annex farmers' land under the guise of "land reclamation" and "joint ventures"; and second, to "officially order" the "seizure" of large amounts of Chinese farmers' land that was cruelly plundered and forcibly concentrated by the Japanese invaders during their occupation. The Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense's Joint Logistics Headquarters, with Chiang Kai-shek's personal "approval," decided on a certain day this year to establish land reclamation corps in provinces such as Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Guizhou, driving disabled and retired soldiers to "implement compulsory 'land reclamation'." The land of ordinary farmers is being annexed, causing them to cry out in misery. Yunnan has also followed the orders of the Kuomintang Executive Yuan to implement the same measures, establishing a "Land Reclamation Bureau" and setting up so-called collective farms in the Yunnan-Burma border area. It is rumored that the "land reclamation" in the Yunnan-Burma border area is also related to the US-Chiang military transportation plan in Southwest China. As for the "seizure" of land plundered by the enemy and puppets, the scale is largest in Northeast China and Taiwan. The so-called "pioneer fields" of the Japanese in Northeast China amount to millions of mu, which have been taken over by the "Northeast Land Reclamation Bureau" specially established by the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense. This bureau completely inherits the Japanese "Northeast Development Headquarters." The director of the bureau once declared that they would continue to implement the Japanese development policy in Northeast China. According to Tang Huizu, deputy director of the Kuomintang Land Administration Department, after inspecting Taiwan in January, about one-fourth of the land in Taiwan is considered "public land" left by the enemy, and they are preparing to establish so-called "cooperative farms" to engage in mechanized farming. Tang also publicly praised Japan's "good management in the past 50 years" in Taiwan's agriculture. The Northeast development land and Taiwan's "public land" were the most barbaric means used by the Japanese invaders to exploit Chinese farmers in these two regions in the past, and the most blatant manifestation of their colonial policy. Now, this policy is being fully continued by the Kuomintang government to control Chinese agriculture and exploit farmers' production. This matter has aroused widespread anger among farmers in various regions. One of the contents of the slogan to abolish Chiang's "public enterprises" raised in the Taiwan People's Autonomy Movement is to oppose the Chiang government's plunder of Taiwan's land. At the same time, the United States is actively developing direct control over Chinese agriculture through its "UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA) connections. All Chinese agricultural "land reclamation" and "joint ventures" are actually carried out entirely under the control of American capital and American technology. The so-called "mechanization of Chinese agriculture" is actually "Americanization." The National Government's "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (ERRRA) Agricultural and Forestry Department, together with the Agricultural Reclamation Office under the control of American capital, and the "Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee," which is mainly composed of the American side of the UNRRA and the Kuomintang Agriculture and Forestry, Food, Transportation, and Economic departments, directly manage Chinese agriculture. "Agricultural machinery factories" have been established in various provinces, and hundreds of electric engines have been transported to the Yellow River flood area in Kaifeng, Henan, and Hubei. Most of the technicians in these factories are Americans, and the deputy director of the factory, Ke Baix, was sent by the UNRRA. In northern Anhui, a huge "cooperative farm" has been established in thirteen counties. The farmland forcibly "concentrated" by the farm is approximately four hundred and ten thousand mu, and the operating capital and tools are entirely planned by the American side. The "Agricultural Machinery Office" and the "Rehabilitation Committee" are nominally for improving Chinese agricultural technology and relieving Chinese rural areas, but in reality, they are using this as a means to implement the "Agriculture China, Industry America" plan formulated by the "Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Team" last year. The normal private agriculture in the Chiang-controlled areas is being destroyed by American money and American machines, and the vast number of farmers are thus plunged into a more serious abyss of unemployment and suffering. This is the true picture of American agricultural mechanization in the Chiang-controlled rural areas in collaboration with the Chiang government.

    美蒋勾结借名屯垦合营
    大规模掠夺农民土地
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各地报纸消息披露：蒋介石政府自去冬以来，即在全国范围内对人民土地实行大规模军事性掠夺兼并，并企业在所谓美式机械化步骤下达到蒋记官僚资本与美国金融势力结合一起彻底控制中国农业之目的。
    据悉蒋政府掠夺人民土地之具体办法有二：一为利用“屯垦”“合营”名义公开侵夺和兼并农民土地，一为“明令”“接收”日寇在其占领期间残酷掠夺和强迫集中之大量中国农民土地。国民党国防部联勤总部已于今年一日间经蒋介石亲自“核批”决定在湖南、四川、福建、甘肃、陕西、贵州等省设置屯垦总队，驱使残废军人及退役军人“实行强制性‘屯垦’。”一般农民土地横遭兼并，农民皆叫苦连天。云南亦奉国民党行政院命令实行同样办法，成立“垦殖总局”，在滇缅边境地区设置所谓集体农场。据传滇缅边地区之“垦殖”与美蒋在中国西南之军事交通计划亦有关系。至于敌伪掠夺土地之“接收”以东北与台湾规模最大，东北日人所谓“开拓田”已有数百万亩，为国民党国防部特设之“东北屯垦局”所接收，该局系完全继承日寇东北“开拓总局”者，该局局长曾宣称彼等在东北将继续实施日人之开拓政策。台湾据国民党地政署副署长汤蕙族一月间在台视察后称：台湾全省土地约有四分之一算作敌遗留之“公地”，准备设立所谓“合作农场”，从事机械化之耕作。汤氏并公开赞美日本在台湾农业方面“过去五十年之经营其为良好”云。东北开拓地与台湾“公地”为过去日寇在该两地榨取中国农民之最野蛮手段，为其殖民地政策之最露骨表现，今此种政策又为国民党政府全部继续，用以控制中国农业榨取农民生产。此事已激起各地农民之普遍愤怒，此次台湾人民自治运动中所提废除蒋记“公营事业”口号内容之一，即系反对蒋政府对台湾土地之掠夺。同时美国正通过“联总”关系，积极开展对于中国农业之直接控制，所有中国农业之“屯垦”“合营”，实际上系完全在美国资本与美国技术控制下进行者，所谓“中国农业之机械化”实即“美国化”之谓。国民政府“行总”农林部合组织在美国资本控制下之农垦处与以“联总”美国方面为主体而由国民党农林、粮食、交通、经济四部成立之“黄（河）泛（滥）区复兴委员会”两机构直接主持中国农业之经营。“农械厂”已在各省设立分厂，已将电引机数百架运往河南开封黄泛区及湖北等地，该厂技术人员多为美人，该厂副主任柯白×系“联总”派来者。皖北方面已在十三县设立庞大之“合作农场”该场强迫“集中”之农田约为四百×十余万亩，经营资本及工具完全由美方统筹。“农械处”与“复委会”名义上为改进中国农业技术及救济中国农村，但实际上系为借以实行去年“中美农业合作团”所拟定之“农业中国工业美国”计划。蒋管区农村之正常私营农业，正为美国金钱与美国机器所摧毁，广大农民因此陷入更严重之失业和痛苦深渊，这就是美国在蒋管区农村与蒋政府实行农业机械化之真象。
