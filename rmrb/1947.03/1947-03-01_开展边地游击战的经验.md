Experiences in Conducting Guerrilla Warfare in Border Areas
Chen Xin

Currently, the mass guerrilla war in the border areas of the Taihang Region is widely underway, and heroic models who persist in the struggle in the border areas have emerged, such as Jia Maohou from Taigu, Tian Si'er from Yuci, Liu Ziqiang from Xiuwu, and Wang Guoan from Tangyin. From studying how these border heroes opened up the situation of guerrilla warfare, we have drawn the following experiences for your reference:

(1) Guerrilla Warfare Must Be Closely Combined with Mobilizing the Masses

The heroes mentioned above are all models of closely integrating guerrilla warfare with mobilizing the masses. In the struggle against the enemy, all villages have largely implemented "land to the tiller." In Liu Ziqiang's village in Xiuwu, the entire village originally cultivated twelve *qing* of land, of which landlords (eight households) occupied eight *qing* and forty *mu*. After the struggle, the masses took back the land and everyone was liberated. Tian Si'er's village originally cultivated fifteen *qing* of land, of which one landlord household cultivated seven *qing*. After the struggle, all but five households in the village received land.

Where should guerrilla warfare and mobilizing the masses start? This should be determined based on the specific local conditions. Wang Guoan, in March of last year, seized the gap when the enemy did not launch a large-scale attack on his village, and mobilized the masses four times in half a month, quickly mobilizing and arming the masses to carry out guerrilla warfare. Tian Si'er, under the frantic looting of the Yan puppet regime, organized the masses to resist looting and then led the masses to turn to the land struggle. Regardless of where you start, the two should be closely integrated once you start, with one hand holding a gun and the other distributing land; men fighting and women distributing land; or closely combining arming the masses with mobilizing the masses, developing and establishing militia, and carrying out guerrilla warfare to defend the gains of liberation. For example, after the first struggle against the local tyrant, Wang Guoan proposed: "We are liberated! Is it okay not to organize a militia? What should we do when the stubborn army comes?" After discussion among the masses, seven militiamen were organized, disarming seven rifles from Sun Zhenhui, arming themselves. In the next three struggles, the militia developed to twenty-two people, and four more rifles were bought with the fruits of the struggle. In this way, a solid ideological and organizational foundation for guerrilla warfare was laid in the mass movement, enabling guerrilla warfare to develop rapidly and widely.

The characteristics of mobilizing the masses in the border areas are: because landlords, secret agents, local tyrants, and black gunners are integrated, when mobilizing the masses, it is necessary to accurately target these extremely hated and extremely sinful bullies and combine them with counter-espionage. The scope of attack should be small, but it should be thorough, rapid, and decisive; the scope of unity should be large, and the method of arbitration should be used to solve problems for small and medium landlords; the distribution of fruits should be broad, paying more attention to uniting all peasants.

(2) Combine the Struggle Against the Stubborn Enemy to Establish the Guerrilla Life and Guerrilla Order of the Border Masses

First of all, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to carry out emptying villages, breaking the peaceful illusions and complacent mentality towards the enemy ideologically. After Tian Si'er mobilized the masses to empty the village, the enemy came to the village several times without causing any losses to the masses, and happily said: "Emptying the village is really good." Liu Ziqiang mobilized the masses to hide food in the rear villages. When the enemy attacked, the masses all moved with peace of mind. Liu Ziqiang concluded: "Food is the lifeline. As long as the lifeline of the people is hidden, the people's will to struggle will be firm."

Secondly, it is necessary to organize the masses to move. Liu Ziqiang divided the masses into groups and relocation areas, and cadres led them. When the enemy situation was tense, the whole village could move quickly. The masses reflected: "The Eighth Route Army is really good, they can find ways for the masses!" Tian Si'er also mobilized the masses of the whole village to dig cave dwellings in the wild, and they all lived outside the village at night. Although the enemy tried their best to encircle and attack, the masses suffered no losses. In areas of intense struggle, it is necessary to seize the time to transform the terrain and carry out cave and tunnel warfare so that the masses have a basis for fighting the enemy.

(3) Organize the Combination of Labor and Military Affairs to Arm and Defend Production

Doing a good job in combining labor and military affairs can further strengthen the masses' confidence in the struggle and mobilize the whole people against the enemy. There are three forms of combining labor and military affairs: (1) The militia and the masses are mixed to form mutual aid groups, which jointly produce in peacetime, and the militia covers them in wartime, implementing work points and recording work by *xiang*. This is how Liu Ziqiang did it. (2) The militia and the masses are organized separately, with the militia in front and the masses behind. They all produce in peacetime, and the militia covers the masses to move in wartime. In the morning, they are in the direction far from the enemy, and in the afternoon, they are in the direction close to the enemy. The land in the whole village is exchanged for work production. This is how Wang Guoan did it. (3) If necessary, use joint defense to support production. After Tian Si'er led the masses to move to ×× village, he helped the masses of that village produce and exchanged work with each other.

The above three methods are to change the organizational form according to the different enemy situations. In the first form, the relationship between the militia and the masses is good, but under the tense enemy situation, it is not as good as the second form, so that the militia can concentrate its strength to deal with the enemy. The third form is a kind of assault method in the season of defending the summer harvest and autumn harvest and fighting with the enemy. Organizing joint defense or large-scale support from the entire rear is very necessary.

(4) Organize Joint Defense While Pushing the Struggle Forward

Organizing joint defense and mutual support is a good way to fight the enemy, but in the past, most of the local joint defense was between border villages and rear villages, forming prominent and isolated front villages, which were easily lost. Recently, under the principle of "the enemy advances, I advance; the enemy does not advance, I also advance," the focus of the struggle against the enemy is pushed forward, and the organization of joint defense is also to join forces with the front guerrilla villages or the villages occupied by the enemy. This is a major development in the organization of joint defense! ××× carried out the work of ×× village in front of his village, helped the masses to liberate themselves, and developed eleven militiamen. He also extracted six rifles from his village to support them. He said: "As long as the work of ×× village is done well, wherever the enemy comes from, the enemy will be stopped there." He also developed × informers in the enemy stronghold. Liu Ziqiang also organized the masses in the enemy stronghold and let them produce in the border area close to our side. Jia Maohou organized the youth of various villages in the stubborn occupied area to get in touch with the soldiers of the stubborn army, striving to disintegrate the stubborn puppet army. These are all typical examples of pushing the struggle forward and organizing joint defense.

The content of joint defense used to be only mutual support in combat and intelligence, but now it includes supporting liberation and mutual aid production, and the villages have formed extremely close ties of life and death.

(5) Use Ambush and Raiding Tactics to Annihilate the Returning Home Corps and Revenge Squads, and Use Joint Defense Explosions to Deal with Large Groups of Enemies.

Just after the Yan army's large-scale offensive, eight people from the Zhicun area brought seven rifles to Tian Si'er's village to demand food. Si'er used a surprise encirclement, except for one enemy on guard who escaped, the remaining seven people and six guns were all captured. Jia Maohou said: "To fight the Returning Home Corps, we must use the method of an eagle catching a rabbit, 'sculpting' it and not letting go!" So he often killed or captured three or five enemies. This is a new experience in militia tactics, unlike in the past when simply harassing the enemy or driving the enemy away was considered a success.

The method of dealing with large-scale enemy offensives is to adopt joint defense operations and explosions. In October of last year, the enemy in Yuci attacked Tian Si'er in two routes with a battalion of troops. A group of enemies first arrived in Beitian, and Si'er led the militia to support them; another group of enemies attacked Si'er village from the south, first stepping on two mines, killing three enemies and wounding two. Si'er encountered the enemy back and forth, and retreated to Zhanghu village behind, causing the two enemies to fight misunderstanding, killing and wounding more than ten people. The enemy attacked Zhanghu again, and Si'er and the militiamen from Zhanghu and other villages had buried landmines to meet them, and the enemy stepped on two more, killing one and wounding three. The enemy did not dare to move forward anymore, and Si'er led the militia to counterattack, driving the enemy back. This is an example of joint defense and explosion repelling a large group of enemies. There are many militia in other places who fought such battles. As long as we do a good job in joint defense and explosions, the militia are fully capable of crushing the enemy's large-scale offensives!

　　开展边地游击战的经验
    陈新
    目前我太行区边地群众游击战争，普遍开展，涌现出太谷贾毛猴、榆次田四儿、修武刘自强、汤阴王国安等坚持边地斗争的英雄模范。我们从研究这些边地英雄如何打开游击战争局面的创造中，得出下面几点经验，供大家参考：
  （一）游击战争与发动群众要紧密结合
    上面说的各位英雄都是游击战争与发动群众紧密结合的模范。在对敌斗争中各村都大体上实行了耕者有其田。修武刘自强村，全村原种地十二顷，地主八户就占有八顷四十亩，斗争后，群众把土地收回，大家都翻了身；田四儿村原种地十五顷，地主一户就种了七顷，斗争后，全村除五户外，都分得土地。
    游击战争与发动群众，两者应先从那里着手？这要根据当地具体情况来决定。王国安在去年三月间，抓住敌人未向他村大举进攻的空隙，半月内发动了四次群众斗争，迅速把群众发动与武装起来，开展了游击战争；田四儿则是在阎伪疯狂抢掠下，组织群众反掠夺，紧接着领导群众转上了土地斗争。不论先从那里开始，但一着手后，二者即应紧密结合，一手拿枪、一手分田；男人打仗、女人分田；或在发动群众中紧密结合武装群众，发展建立民兵，为保卫翻身利益开展游击战争。如王国安在大家第一次斗争恶霸后就提出：“咱们翻了身啦！不组织民兵行不行？顽固军来了怎样办？”经过群众讨论，组织了七个民兵，解除了孙真会七枝步枪，武装了自己。在以后三次斗争中，民兵发展到二十二人，又拿斗争果实买了四条步枪。这样在群运中，就打下坚实的游击战思想与组织基础，使游击战争能迅速广泛开展起来。
    边地发动群众的特点是：由于地主、特务、恶霸、黑枪手结为一体；发动群众时，要打准这些为群众痛恨，罪大恶极的奸霸，并和反特结合起来，打的面要小，但要彻底迅速、干脆；团结的面要大，对中小地主应用仲裁方式，解决问题；分配果实面应广，更多的注意团结全体农民。
  （二）结合群众对顽斗争建立边地群众的游击生活与游击秩序
    首先是要动员群众进行空室清野，从思想上打破对敌和平幻想与苟安心理。田四儿在动员群众空舍清野后，敌人数次到村里群众都没受损失，很高兴的说：“空室清野真是好。”刘自强动员群众把粮食藏到后方村，敌人进攻时，群众便都安心转移，刘自强得出经验说：“粮食是命根，只要把老百姓命根藏好了，老百姓斗争意志一定坚决。”
    其次要组织群众转移，刘自强把群众都划分了组与转移地区，并有干部带领，敌情紧张时，全村能迅速转移。群众反映说：“八路军真好，能给群众想办法！”田四儿并动员全村群众在野外打窑洞，黑夜都在村外住，敌人虽然费尽心思包围袭击，但群众毫未受损失。在斗争紧张地区，要争取时间改造地形，开展窑洞地道斗争，使群众对敌斗争有依托。
  （三）组织劳武结合武装保卫生产
    劳武结合搞的好，更可坚定群众斗争信心，发动全民对敌。劳武结合的形式有三：（１）民兵和群众混合组成互助组，平时共同生产，战时民兵掩护，实行工票，按晌记工，刘自强就是这样作的。（２）民兵和群众分别组织起来，民兵在前，群众在后，平时都生产，战时民兵掩护群众转移，上午在距敌远的方向，下午到距敌近的方向，全村土地互相变工生产，王国安就是这样作的。（３）必要时以联防支援帮助生产，田四儿带领群众转移到××村后，即帮助该村群众生产，互相变工。
    以上三种办法是根据敌情的不同，而变换组织形式，第一种形式，民兵和群众关系好，但在敌情紧张下，就不如第二种形式，以便民兵集中力量对付敌人。第三种形式是在保卫夏收、秋收季节和敌人争夺的一种突击办法，组织联防或整个后方的大支援是非常需要的。
  （四）把斗争向前推进中组织联防
    组织联防互相支援，这是对敌作战的一个好办法，但过去各地多是边地村和后方村的联防，形成前方村突出孤立，易遭损失。最近各地在“敌进我进，敌不进我亦进”的方针下，把对敌斗争焦点，向前面推进，组织联防也是和前方游击村或敌占据点村来联防，这是联防组织的一个大发展！×××开展了他村前面的××村工作，帮助群众翻身并发展了十一个民兵，他又把自己村的步枪抽出六枝支援他们。他说：“只要××村工作搞起来，敌人从那里来，那里就会打住敌人。”他还在敌据点发展有×个情报员，刘自强并把敌据点的群众组织起来，让到靠近我方的边地生产。贾毛猴组织顽占区各村青年与顽军士兵取得联系，争取瓦解顽伪军，这都是把斗争向前推进并组织联防的典型。
    联防的内容，过去仅是作战与情报上的互相支援，现在则包括了支援翻身互助生产，村与村之间结成生死相连的，极密切联系。
  （五）用伏击奇袭战术歼灭还乡团、复仇队，用联防爆炸对付大
        股敌人。
    田四儿在阎军大进攻刚过后，有治村八个人带步枪七枝到他村要粮，四儿便用奇袭包围战，除一个站岗的敌人逃脱外，其余七人六枪，全被俘获。贾毛猴说：“打还乡团要用鹰抓兔的办法，‘雕’住就不放”！所以他经常三、五个毙俘敌人。这是民兵战术的新经验，不像过去单纯扰敌或把敌人赶跑就算了事。
    对付大股敌人进攻的办法，采取联防作战与爆炸。去年十月间，榆次敌人以一个营的兵力分两路向田四儿进攻，一股敌人先到北田，四儿便带领民兵去支援；另一股敌人从南面向四儿村进攻，先踏响了两个雷，死敌三名伤二名。四儿前后遇敌，便向后面张胡村退却，使两方敌人打了误会，死伤十余人。敌人又向张胡进攻，四儿和张胡等村民兵，已埋好地雷来迎接，敌人又踏响两颗，死一伤三，敌人不敢再往前进，四儿便带领民兵反击，把敌打退，这是联防与爆炸打退大股敌人的一个范例。其他各地民兵打这样仗的很多，只要我们联防与爆炸搞的好，民兵是有完全可能粉碎敌人大股进攻的！
