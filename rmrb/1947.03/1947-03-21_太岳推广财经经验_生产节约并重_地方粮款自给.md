    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 19th] Many counties in Taiyue last year combined financial management with production, resolving the expenditure of local grain and funds. Jincheng used local grain and funds to operate paper mills, wineries, oil mills, and flour mills, earning a profit of 2.8 million yuan. The entire expenditure of local grain and funds was 2 million yuan, leaving a surplus of 800,000 yuan. Gaoping also operated various workshops, earning a profit of 960,000 yuan (local funds expenditure was 1 million yuan, with a slight shortfall). Qinyuan's various productions also earned a profit of 1 million yuan throughout the year. The three counties collectively increased fiscal revenue by 4.76 million yuan, greatly reducing the burden on the masses. Based on this experience, the Taiyue Administrative Office decided that this year, local grain and funds should emphasize both production and conservation. Under the principle of not affecting fiscal expenditure and not affecting the focus of work, each county can use local grain and funds in conjunction with the county's production characteristics to operate factories and workshops (but is not allowed to engage in commerce), so as not to levy local funds from the masses, thereby reducing the burden on the masses.

    生产节约并重
    地方粮款自给
    【本报太岳十九日电】太岳许多县份去年以财政管理与生产结合，解决了地方粮款的开支。晋城利用地方粮款经营纸厂、酒坊、油坊、粉坊等，获利二百八十万元。地方粮款全部开支二百万元，尚余八十万元。高平也经营了各种作坊，获利九十六万元（地方款开支一百万元，稍有不足）。沁源各项生产，全年亦获利一百万元。三县共增加财政收入四百七十六万元，大大减轻了群众负担。太岳行署根据此项经验，决定今年地方粮款采取生产与节约并重，在不影响财政开支，及不影响工作重点原则下，各县可利用地方粮款结合本县生产特点，经营工厂作坊（但不准经营商业），作到不向群众征收地方款，以减轻群众负担。
