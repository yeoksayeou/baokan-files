　　The People of Xiangling in the Grid Network
    Taiyue Branch
   (1) Enclosed in the Grid Network
    The Xiangling Liberated Area has an area of only 1,300 square li, bordering the Tongpu Railway to the east, 15 li away from the Fushan-Yicheng Highway to the west, 40 li away from the Quwo-Yicheng Highway to the south, and 30 li away from the Linfen-Fushan Highway to the north. All around are important strongholds of the Chiang Kai-shek army, but it can proudly stand in the enemy's grid network, blocking the enemy's two brigades from sweeping. The surrounding Chiang Kai-shek army is often more than ten times larger than ours, but the 34,000 soldiers and civilians of Xiangling have never known what surrender means. They only have extreme contempt for the reactionaries and try to eliminate them. The reason why they can persevere in hard struggle in the grid network is precisely because the people have the determination and rich experience in self-defense war, because of the correct leadership, and because the local cadres, external cadres, and the army can closely unite, closely contact the masses in many ways, share life and death, persist in their positions, and protect the interests of the people. Therefore, no matter how bad the environment is, they can get the support of the masses, and the enemy cannot squeeze them out of this small area. On the contrary, they have developed. Last winter, a martial arts team was established to advance into the west of Tongpu Road, develop work, and establish a people's armed political power—the Third District Office.
  (2) Abandoned Peace Thoughts
    From October 23rd last year to January this year, the Chiang Kai-shek army conducted nine "sweeps" against the Xiangling Liberated Area, using more than eleven regiments. The sweeps lasted from one day to a week, looting, destroying, and raping, creating countless sins. Wherever the Chiang Kai-shek army went, they dug three feet into the ground, and all the gold, silver, and soft goods were swept away. What showed the Chiang Kai-shek army to be even more savage and depraved was the rape of women. In Wentao Temple Village, forty women were raped, and a seventeen-year-old girl in Dragon King Temple was gang-raped by eight Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, with her cheeks bitten. This kind of action by the Chiang Kai-shek army precisely shows the despairing emotions of officers and soldiers suppressing war and having no way out. In the past, some of the masses still had some peaceful illusions about the Chiang Kai-shek army, but after the Chiang Kai-shek army's "sweeping," the serious destruction threatened the lives of the people, and peaceful illusions were abandoned. Even the landlords realized that "the Chiang Kai-shek army is really bad." Jia Puru was the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Xiangling County Party Department. The secret caves in his home that had not been dug out when the Japanese devils were there were dug out by the Chiang Kai-shek army this time, causing great losses. He said indignantly: "The No. 1 Army in the world is really the No. 1 bad army in the world."
  (3) War Strengthens the People
    The militia joint defense, county security team, martial arts team, and other local armed forces in Xiangling have been tempered by the hard struggle of crushing the Chiang Kai-shek army's "sweeping" in the past, and now they are even stronger. In December last year, the Chiang Kai-shek army's special service battalion surrounded our district cadre team and militia in Dazheng Village. After they rushed out, they actively cooperated with the villagers and militia of various joint defenses who came to support them, and in turn surrounded the Chiang Kai-shek army in the village and beat them hard, killing four Chiang Kai-shek soldiers including a platoon leader and wounding more than 20. On February 5th this year, the Zhongliang militia were surrounded by the Chiang Kai-shek army in a courtyard, and the situation was very dangerous, but they drove the Chiang Kai-shek army off the roof, occupied the position, and repelled three enemy attacks. The enemy finally burned the house with firewood, but they rushed out of the gate.
    The Chiang Kai-shek army has never dared to fight our Xiangling people's armed forces for more than an hour. As soon as a shot is fired, the joint defense militia will come from all directions, and the more they fight, the more they become, like a swarm of bees. What the enemy fears most is the "swarm of bees tactics." Due to the militia's firm fighting spirit, a conscious wartime discipline has been formed. First, rather die than be captured alive by the Chiang Kai-shek army; second, rather die than confess, and never implicate others. This shows the high self-esteem of the people in the liberated areas. After the Zhongliang Village militia Li Binggeng was caught by the Chiang Kai-shek army, he broke three bowl-thick sticks, but he refused to surrender. When the enemy untied him to sober him up for final disposal, he ran away. When he fled to the vicinity of Suncun, he encountered the enemy again. Knowing that it would be difficult to survive, he resolutely committed suicide. An old man in Ya'ergou, the Chiang Kai-shek army asked him to confess where there were Eighth Route Army soldiers. The flesh on his hands was beaten off, revealing white bones. He only said one sentence: "I don't know anything." A little doll in Dongzhang, the Chiang Kai-shek army grabbed him and asked: "Is the Central Army good? Is the Eighth Route Army good?" The little doll looked at their fierce faces and said: "The Eighth Route Army is good, they don't bully the common people; the Central Army is bad, they bully women, tie up and beat the common people." The Chiang Kai-shek army chased two militiamen to Yuguang Village. An old man hid the militiamen in a secret cave behind the door, with a torn mat covering the entrance of the cave. The Chiang Kai-shek army did not find them and forced the old man to hand over the people. Although the old man was severely beaten, he firmly refused to admit it. The Chiang Kai-shek army said helplessly: "Consider your old man's bones hard." There are countless such acts of lofty integrity, which represent the awe-inspiring righteousness of the people of Xiangling.
  (4) Always Ready to Fight
    The people of Xiangling are always happy in the midst of arduous struggle. Three "Support the Love and Oppose Chiang and Anti-American Congresses" were held one after another in the month of embracing love, with half of the population participating, which was a great event for a time. The stilt performance in Anli Village is "The Sinners of All Ages are Inherited in One Vein." Chen Village's performance of "Attacking Fortifications" is lively, and the militiamen are all carrying guns, ready to fight at any time. The children who are twisting the Yangko are carrying bags, ready to transfer at any time. The "Chongshan Opera Troupe" that performs dramas is the martial arts team, and the people's entertainment is combat mobilization and combat organization. On the Lantern Festival, the custom here is to eat fried rice cakes. Coincidentally, every household pinched a Chiang Kai-shek with glutinous rice flour and put it in oil to fry it. All the guests were allowed to taste "Chiang Kai-shek deserves to die." The children were even happier, taking the fried "Chiang Kai-shek deserves to die" to play on the street. Intimate little friends let each other say: "You eat my 'Chiang Kai-shek deserves to die'." This shows to what extent the people hate Chiang Kai-shek, the head of state who betrays the country and leads the civil war.

　　格子网中的襄陵人民
    太岳分社
   （一）被封锁在格子网里
    襄陵解放区仅有一千三百平方华里的面积，东接同蒲路，西距浮（山）翼（城）公路十五里，南距曲（沃）翼（城）公路四十里，北距临（汾）浮（山）公路三十里，四面都是蒋军重要据点，但它却能傲然屹立在敌人格子网中，阻击敌人两个旅的扫荡。周围蒋军常大于我十数倍，但襄陵三万四千军民从不知什么叫投降，对反动派只是极端卑视和设法把他们消灭掉。他们所以能在格子网里坚持苦斗，正是因为人民有着自卫战争的决心和丰富的经验，由于领导的正确，由于本地干部外来干部和军队都能亲密团结，都能在多方面紧密联系群众，生死与共，坚持阵地，保护人民利益。所以环境无论如何恶劣，都可得到群众拥护，敌人就不能从这块狭小的地区把他们挤出来，相反的，他们得到了发展。去年冬天成立了武工队，挺进同蒲路西，开辟工作，建立起人民武装政权——第三区公所。
  （二）丢掉了和平思想
    去年十月二十三日到今年一月，蒋军对襄陵解放区进行过九次“扫荡”，用兵十一个团以上。短则一天，长则一礼拜，抢劫、破坏、奸淫，造下数不尽的罪恶。蒋军足迹到处，掘地三尺，金银细软一卷而空。表现了蒋军更野蛮下流的是奸淫妇女。紊陶寺村有四十个妇女被奸淫，龙王庙十七岁小女被八个蒋军轮奸，两颊被咬烂。蒋军此种举动正表现了官兵压战和毫无出路的绝望情绪。过去有些群众对蒋军还存在一些和平幻想，可是经过蒋军的“扫荡”，严重的破坏威胁到人民的生活，和平幻想就被丢开了。连地主们也体会到“蒋军真正坏”。贾朴如是国民党襄陵县党部书记长，日寇在时他家未被刨过的暗洞这回都被蒋军刨开了，损失很大。他愤慨的说：“天下第一军真是天下第一等坏军队。”
  （三）战争锻炼得人民更坚强
    襄陵的民兵联防和县保卫队、武工队等地方武装，过去就有经过粉碎蒋军“扫荡”的艰苦锻炼，现在更坚强了。去年十二月蒋军特务营将我一区区干队、民兵包围在大郑村。当他们冲出来以后，积极配合赶来增援的各联防村民兵，反把蒋军包围在村里痛击，毙蒋军排长以下四名，伤二十余名。今年二月五日，中梁民兵被蒋军包围在一处院子里，情况很危险，但他们反把蒋军从屋顶上赶下去，占领阵地，击溃敌人三次冲锋，敌人最后用柴火烧房子，他们却从大门口冲出去。
    蒋军与我襄陵人民武装作战从不敢超过一个钟头，只要一处枪响，联防民兵便从四面八方涌来，越打越多，像一群蚂蜂，敌人最恐惧的是“蚂蜂战术”。由于民兵坚强的斗志，形成自觉的战时纪律。第一宁死不让蒋军活捉；第二宁死不招口供，决不连累旁人。表现了解放区人民高度的自尊心。中梁村民兵李丙庚在蒋军抓住之后，打断了三条碗粗的大棒，他都拒绝投降。当敌人松捆让他清醒作最后处理时，他跑了。逃至孙村附近，又与敌人遭遇，情知难活，他便毅然自杀。鸭儿沟某老人，蒋军要他招出那里有八路军，手上的肉被打掉，露出白磷磷的骨头，他只说过一句话：“我不知道什么了。”东张一个小娃娃，蒋军把他抓过来问：“中央军好？八路军好？”小娃娃看看他们凶恶的面目，说：“八路军好，不欺侮老百姓；中央军不好，欺侮女人，捆打老百姓。”蒋军追着两个民兵到与光村，某老汉把民兵藏在门后暗洞中，洞口上遮一块破席。蒋军未寻到，逼着老汉要人，老汉虽遭毒打，坚不承认。蒋军无可奈何的说：“算你老汉骨头硬。”这类崇高气节的事不知有多少，它正代表了襄陵人民的凛然正气。
  （四）时刻准备战斗
    襄陵人民在艰苦的斗争中从来是愉快的。拥爱月中先后举行三个“拥爱与反蒋反美大会”，有一半人口参加，盛极一时。安李村扮演的高跷是“千古罪人一脉相传”。陈庄扮演“攻坚战”，闹烘火的民兵都带着枪，随时准备战斗，扭秧歌的儿童们带着包袱，随时准备转移。演剧的“崇山剧团”就是武工队，人民的娱乐就是战斗动员，战斗组织。元宵节，此间风俗吃油糕。不约而同，家家户户用糯米面捏一个蒋介石，放在油里去炸，来的客人都让尝尝“蒋该死”。孩子们更高兴了，带着炸熟的“蒋该死”到街上去玩。知心的小朋友互让说：“你吃我的‘蒋该死’。”这就可见人民对卖国、内战之独裁的祸首蒋介石痛恨到何种程度了。
