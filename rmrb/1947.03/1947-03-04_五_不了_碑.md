　　The Five "No's" Stele
    In the Wangye Mansion area (the center of the Kalaqin Right Banner) between Ningcheng and Weichang in central Rehe, a myth about a "Five No's Stele" is circulating. It is said that one evening, a beautiful village suddenly appeared east of the Wangye Mansion, and ten thousand rays of red light rose from the village. When people walked towards it, the red light and the village disappeared, leaving only a stone stele with five inscriptions:
    1. The Central Army can't hold out;
    2. The Eighth Route Army can't be driven away;
    3. The wealthy landlords can't stay rich;
    4. The poor people can't remain poor;
    5. Good people can't die.
    Local elders believe that the origin of this myth lies in the fact that Chiang's army and bandits commit all kinds of evil deeds, including rape and plunder; while the Eighth Route Army, penetrating behind Chiang's lines, rescues the people; thus, it has cultivated a universal psychology of popular aversion to Chiang and longing for the Eighth Route Army.

    (Editor's note: Myths mostly arise from people's explanations of natural phenomena, containing certain class affections, rebellious emotions, and hopes. In areas near deserts, mirages may occur due to the refraction of hot air and light, and people then attach explanations to them. While the matter may not be entirely believable, the emotions are real.)

### 五“不了”碑

　　五“不了”碑
    在热河中部宁城与围场间的王爷府（为喀拉沁右旗中心）周围数十里内，流传着一个“五不了碑”的神话，据说有一天傍晚，王爷府东突然现出一座美丽的村庄，从村中升起了万丈红光。当人们向该处走去，红光与村庄都隐没不见了，只剩下一块石碑，上面刻着五字迹：
    一、中央军长不了；
    二、八路军走不了；
    三、大户富不了；
    四、穷人穷不了；
    五、好人死不了。
    当地父老们都认为这种神话的起因，在于蒋军土匪奸淫抢掠，无恶不作；而八路军深入蒋后，解救人民；因而选成了人心厌蒋和想念八路军的普遍心理。（新华社冀热辽二十六日电）
    （编者按：神话大都产生与人民对自然界现象的一种解释，其中包含一定的阶级的好恶感情和反抗情绪及希望。沙漠附近可能因热空气及光线的屈折，发生海市蜃楼，人民从而附会解说之，其事虽还不可尽信，但感情还是真实的。）
