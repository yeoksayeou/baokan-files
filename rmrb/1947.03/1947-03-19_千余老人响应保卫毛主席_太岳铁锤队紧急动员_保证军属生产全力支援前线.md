　　[This report from our newspaper, Taiyue, 17th] Last year, Wang Yuan, a sixty-year-old from Yangcheng, formed the Iron Hammer Team consisting of one thousand and eight elderly men to defend Chairman Mao. Now, they have urgently mobilized again to work valiantly in defense of Chairman Mao. Wang Yuan was extremely angered upon hearing the news of Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Yan'an. He called on all members to "raise their iron hammers and smash the large stone slab of Chiang Kai-shek that oppresses the people!" He called on the one thousand and eight members to actively lead production in the rear, allowing young people to go to the front lines to fight, and to take good care of military families to comfort the soldiers at the front. The Iron Hammer Teams of Yigu and Yibi determined that two members would guarantee the production of each military family. The three villages of Yigu, etc., raised 380,000 yuan to establish a United Cooperative Society for Preferential Treatment of Military Families, specifically to solve the difficulties of military families. The elderly men said with great confidence: "Chiang Kai-shek cannot move a single hair on Chairman Mao's head; just look at our Iron Hammer Team and you'll know!"
