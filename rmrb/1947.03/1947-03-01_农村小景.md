Rural Scene
    Mu Zhi

    Recently, this reporter stayed in Fanjia Yao Village, Licheng, for a few days. The impression I got was that everything had changed, and is still changing.

    This village is in a deep, barren valley. Before the War of Resistance, only five or six of the 38 households in the village were relatively well-off, and half of the families were herding sheep or working as hired laborers elsewhere. The whole village had only five livestock. Now, the whole village has risen to the level of prosperous middle peasants. Last year, the whole village achieved a surplus after farming, and only five households still do not have livestock.

    A large plaque given to the village by the Commissioner's Office hangs in the street, with the words "Production Model" inscribed on it. A plaque given to Shi Cunjin—a labor hero in the Taihang area—by the county hangs on his door, with the words "Labor is Glorious" inscribed on it. In the elementary school, there is a large red satin award banner given by the Border Region Government and other various certificates of merit. The inscription on the banner reads "Get Organized to Get Rich." But in the past, in the eyes of the general "respectable people," this was the most "lazy" village.

    I chatted with Shi Cunjin. He participated in the transportation team with his two donkeys. Recently, he received 18,900 yuan in just over twenty days. I asked him if he would earn more money if he drove two livestock alone for transportation. He replied head-on, "That's not right. That's taking care of oneself and not caring about everyone!"

    Shi Cunjin's wife lamented how good the current social system is. She was referring to freedom of marriage. She is now in her forties, and having been married in her teens, she was clearly a victim of old-style marriage. During our conversation, a man in his thirties came to find her. She was preparing to get married, and he, with a serious and anxious expression, wanted Shi Cunjin's wife to investigate the ideology of his future bride.

    Every morning, the militia drills in the field. Some practice on the horizontal bars, some throw hand grenades, and most practice bayonet drills with wooden guns. The militia is also preparing to fight the enemy with bayonets, something that never happened during the Anti-Japanese War.

    The militia captain told the reporter that after the major rent reduction campaign in the winter, all the young and middle-aged people in the village, even the old men and women, signed up to join the militia. In the end, they had to "organize" a bit, excluding the old men and women. However, there was still an old woman who could not be excluded. She insisted on doing odd jobs for everyone in the militia team.

    There is a community-run elementary school in the village, where not only children but also adults attend. In the past, there was no one in the village who could read or write, but now not only many adults but even teenagers can. The elementary school teacher was quite proud of this. Because when he was hired, the agreed condition was that it would take two years, but it was achieved in just over a year.

    There are no clay statues in the large and small temples. I know that the government has never issued any decrees prohibiting belief in gods. I asked an old peasant, and his answer was very simple: in the past, the more we respected the gods, the poorer we became; now that we don't respect them, we have courtyards and fields, so it's better to respect Chairman Mao.

    Shi Cunjin's house is relatively dilapidated. I asked him why he didn't repair it. He said that in the past, any movement would cause trouble, either a person would die or livestock would die. But he said with a smile that this was a past superstitious mindset, and he is preparing to repair it properly this year.

    At night, a large group of people in the village gathered around a warm stove in the elementary school, making a lively noise with their traditional musical instruments. An old man in his forties or fifties suddenly put down his sheng and muttered to himself: "They say plenty to eat and plenty to wear, this is plenty to eat and plenty to wear." In the noise, I asked him how it was plenty to eat and plenty to wear. He shouted loudly at me: "Have something to eat, have something to wear, have somewhere to live, isn't that plenty to eat and plenty to wear?" Then he picked up his sheng again and played along with everyone. The tune they were playing was "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has brought forth a Mao Zedong. ......"

    In the village, the bell rings in the morning to wake everyone up, and the gong rings at night to clear the streets. During the day, everyone returns to their mutual aid groups for production. After staying for a few days, I felt like I was in a school, or in a factory, but not in the countryside.

　　农村小景
    穆之
    最近记者在黎城樊家窑村住了几天，所得的印象是一切都变了，而且还在变着。
    这个村子在一个深沉贫瘠的山谷里，全村三十八户，在抗战前仅有五六家比较过得去，有一半人家在外放羊或当长工。全村不过五个牲口。现在全村已都上升为富裕中农，去年全村达到耕一余一，仅有五户还没有牲口。
    街上挂着专署送给村里的大匾，题的字是“生产模范”，石寸金——太行区劳动英雄门上挂着县里送他的匾，题的字是“劳动光荣”，在小学校里则挂着边区政府送的大红缎子奖旗及其他各种奖状。旗上的题字是“组织起来发家致富”。而从前，在一般“体面人”的眼里，这是一个最“赖”的村子。
    我和石寸金闲扯，他带着自己的二头毛驴参加运输队，最近二十多天分到了一万八千九百元，我问他是否自己赶上二个牲口单独运输赚的钱要多些，他劈头回答说：“这不对，这是光顾自己不顾大家！”
    石寸金媳妇向我感叹着现在的社会制度好，她指的是婚姻自由。她今年四十多岁了，十几岁就娶过门显然她也是旧式婚姻下的牺牲者。在我们闲谈中，一个三十几岁的男人来找她，她正准备结婚，他一脸严肃与焦急的要石寸金媳妇去考察他未来新娘的思想。
    每天一早，民兵就在场上出操，有的在练单杠，有的在投手榴弹，而大部份则拿着木枪在练刺杀，民兵也准备和敌人拚刺刀，这是抗日时期所未曾有过的。
    民兵队长告诉记者，经过冬天大查减，全村所有青壮年连老汉妇女也报名参加民兵，最后只得“编”了一下，把老汉妇女都编了出去，但是还有一个老婆没有编得出去，她坚持要在民兵队里给大家做些杂活。
    村里有一个民办小学，不仅小孩上学，成年人也在里面上学。以前村上没有能写会算的，现在不仅许多成年人，连十几岁的孩子也会了。小学教员谈起这一点颇为得意。因为原来聘请他的时候，讲好的条件就是如此，期间是二年，但一年多就达到了。
    大小庙里都没有泥胎了。我知道政府从未下过任何禁止信神的法令，我问一个老农民，他的回答很简单，从前敬神，越敬越穷；现在不敬了，庄院田地都有了，不如敬敬毛主席。
    石寸金的房子，比较破陋，我问他为什么不修，他说从前一动它，就要出毛病，不是死人就是死牲口，但是他笑着说，这是过去迷信脑筋，他今年已准备好好修一番。
    夜晚，村里一大堆人在小学校里围着融融的炉火大闹其八音会。有一个四五十岁的老汉忽然放下笙自言自语的说：“说是丰衣足食，这可是丰衣足食了。”我在喧扰声中问他怎么是丰衣足食了。他大声向我嚷着：“有得吃，有得穿，有得住，不是丰衣足食了。”于是他又拿起笙和着大家吹起来了。他们吹的调子是“东方红，太阳升，东方出了个毛泽东。………”
    村上清早打钟起床，黑夜打锣净街，白天各归互助组生产。我住了几天，我觉得好像是在一个学校里，或者是在一个工厂里，但不是在农村里。
