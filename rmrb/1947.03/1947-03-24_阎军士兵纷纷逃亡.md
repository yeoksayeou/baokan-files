    Yan Army Soldiers Fleeing in Droves
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 22nd dispatch] Since the all-out political offensive launched in the Fourth District of Yuci in January, Yan Army soldiers have been fleeing to our district in droves. In January and February alone, the entire "Self-Defense Brigade" of Beihelu, one team, all 48 men, deserted. Even some leaders ran away; the instructor of Zhuangzizhi Village, now a village instructor, also ran. Many young men who had been forcibly conscripted have returned home, such as 12 from Yuchengping, 4 from Shagou, 7 from Beizhao, 4 from Yaocun, 7 from Shantou, 12 from Malan Village, and 12 from Liujiapo, all near the railway. A total of 109 men have fled back in the entire district. On the evening of February 19, Song Zhiheng, a first-class private, and Gao Qingpo, a second-class private, from the Fourth Company of the 21st Regiment of the 7th Division of the Third Army of the Shi Men West Barracks, unable to bear the exploitation of the Chiang army, voluntarily deserted to the liberated area with their weapons. They said, "We are only given one steamed bun and a bowl of thin porridge for each meal, which is unbearable." They also said, "New recruits have no freedom; even when going to the toilet, they must be followed by veteran soldiers. Everyone knows that the Eighth Route Army is good at field battles. The Chiang-Yan army is generally afraid of fighting." When asked about the discipline of the Chiang-Yan army, they said, "The division commander said, 'No conscription, no disturbing the people'," but the soldiers secretly say, "No conscription? Then who will conscript your uncle or your brother-in-law?" Finally, they said, "New recruits account for two-thirds of the Fourth Company, and the new recruits are unwilling to serve and plan to desert."

    阎军士兵纷纷逃亡
    【本报太行二十二日电】榆次四区自一月份，全面展开政治攻势以来，阎军士兵纷纷逃来我区。一、二月份内，仅北合流“自卫大队”一个队，四十八人全部跑光了。甚至一些头子也开了小差，庄子治村的指导员，现为乡村教导员也跑了。被抓走的青壮返家甚多，如铁路附近村庄榆城坪十二名、沙沟四名、北赵七名、药村四名、山头七名、马兰村十二名、刘家坡十二名，全区共跑回一百零九名。二月十九日晚，石门西兵营将军第三军七师二十一团四连，一等兵宋志恒，二等兵高庆坡，不堪蒋军压榨，自动携枪逃来解放区。他们说：“每顿只发给一个馒头，一碗稀饭，饿的受不了。”又说：“新兵不自由，上厕所拉屎，也得有老兵跟着，大家都知道八路军野战厉害。蒋阎军普遍怕打仗。”提起蒋阎军的纪律，他们说：“师长讲话说不拉夫、不扰民”，而当兵则暗暗说：“不拉夫？不拉你姑夫，不拉你姐夫。”最后他们说：“四连新兵占三分之二，新兵都不愿干，计划开小差。”
