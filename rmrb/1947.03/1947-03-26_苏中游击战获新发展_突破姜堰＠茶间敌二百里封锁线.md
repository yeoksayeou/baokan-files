Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 24th—The new situation of the guerrilla warfare in the rear of the Chiang army in Central China in the first half of March is the active attack on the Chiang army, with new developments in the east, west and north. After the Chiang army in Suzhong suffered a heavy blow from the People's Liberation Army in the Libao and @Cha areas last month, which opened a large gap, the Chiang army in the west was transferred to the east to reinforce, and the defense task was handed over to the "Self-Defense Force." The People's Liberation Army took the opportunity to attack its western section. On the 7th, it once recovered important towns such as Da Xiaobaimi, and on the 10th, it recovered Xichang, an important eastern town of Haian, in ten minutes, destroyed dozens of blockhouses between Xichang, Libao, and Yangmanhe, and broke into the important town of Jiangyan, forcing the Chiang Kai-shek's Security Corps to retreat. So far, the 200-li long blockade line between Jiangyan and @Cha, which was the most strictly blockaded by the Chiang army, has been opened with two major gaps in the east and west by the People's Liberation Army. On the western front, two regiments of the 90th Brigade of the Reorganized 4th Division, which were barely gathered, launched a "sweep" of the Gao (you) Bao (ying) area. In the past half month, nothing has been gained. The Huaibei People's Liberation Army in northern Jiangsu fought bravely 225 times in half a month, successively capturing seven strongholds including Anfengshan, Mawu, Liuzhuang, and Mahu south of the Longhai Railway, annihilating ten Chiang Kai-shek township offices, capturing 587 "Home-Returning Corps" members, and killing or wounding 317 of them. Except for the Chiang army along the Huaimu Road, which launched two attacks to protect the traffic line, the People's Liberation Army in other areas has completely taken the initiative. In the Yancheng area, there has been no major change in the enemy and us situation in the past half month. Two regiments of the 59th Brigade of the Reorganized 4th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek Nanjing Garrison, which took over the defense of the 28th Division of the Chiang army, arrived in Lianghuai on the 1st of this month and reoccupied Machang on the Lian (shui) Huai (yin) highway and Shichang in the eastern suburbs of Huai'an, and "swept" in all directions. The People's Liberation Army ambushed the "sweeping" Chiang army on the Fuhe line on the 8th, annihilated a machine gun platoon and routed another platoon, forcing the Chiang army in Machang to retreat in panic the next day.
In the past half month, the Suwan People's Liberation Army (excluding Huaibei) fought a total of 23 battles, killing, wounding and capturing 1,813 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, including 1,122 captured alive. The main gains were 3 small cannons, 9 light machine guns and submachine guns, 514 rifles and short guns, 20 Chiang Kai-shek township offices were destroyed, and 15 market towns were captured or forced to retreat.

    苏中游击战获新发展
    突破姜堰＠茶间敌二百里封锁线
    【新华社华中二十四日电】主动打击蒋军，在东西北三面均有新发展，这是华中蒋军后方三月上半月游击战争的新形势。苏中蒋军自上月在李堡、＠茶一带遭子弟兵痛击打开一大缺口后，西段蒋军乃倾巢东调增援，将防守任务交给“自卫队”，子弟兵乃乘虚出击其西段，七日一度恢复大小白米等重镇，十日以十分钟收复海安东要镇西场，摧毁西场、李堡、洋蛮河间数十个封锁碉堡，突入姜堰重镇，逼退蒋记保安总队。至此，蒋军封锁最严之姜堰至＠茶间二百里长的封锁线已被子弟兵打开东西两大缺口。西线由勉强纠集的整四师九十旅两个团向高（邮）宝（应）地区之“扫荡”。半月来一无所获。苏北淮海子弟兵半月中奋战二二五次，连克陇海路南安峰山、马圩、刘庄、马湖等七据点，歼灭十个蒋记乡公所，俘“还乡团”五八七名，毙伤其三一七名。除淮沐路沿线蒋军为保护交通线曾两次出击外，其他地区子弟兵已完全掌握主动。盐阜区半月来敌我形势无大变化，接替蒋军二十八师防务的蒋记南京城防部队整四师五十九旅两个团，于本月一日抵两淮重占涟（水）淮（阴）公路上之马厂及淮安东郊之石塘，四出“扫荡”，子弟兵于八日在滏河线伏击“扫荡”蒋军，歼其一个机枪排，击溃另一排，迫使马厂蒋军于次日慌忙撤退。
    半月中苏皖子弟兵（淮北未计入）共作战二十三次，毙伤俘蒋伪军达一八一三名，内生俘一一二二名，主要获计小炮三门，轻机枪冲锋机枪九挺，长短枪五一四支，摧毁二十个蒋记乡公所，攻克与逼退集镇十五处。
