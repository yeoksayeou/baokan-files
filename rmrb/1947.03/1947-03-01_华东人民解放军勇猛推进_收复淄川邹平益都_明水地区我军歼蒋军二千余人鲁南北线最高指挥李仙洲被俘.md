　　The East China People's Liberation Army Advances Bravely
    Recaptures Zichuan, Zouping, and Yidu
    Our Army Annihilates Over 2,000 Chiang Troops in the Mingshui Area; Li Xianzhou, Supreme Commander of the Lu South-North Line, Captured
    [New China News Agency, East China Front, urgent telegram of the 27th] On the night of the 24th, the East China People's Liberation Army recaptured the three cities of Zichuan, Zouping, and Yidu along the Jiaoji Railway, as well as the two famous towns of Zhoucun and Zhangdian. Together with the previously recaptured cities of Boshan, Laiwu, Xintai, and the city of Yexian in Jiaodong, seven county seats and two major towns have been recovered. In addition to the 7 divisions and 50,000 men of the Chiang army annihilated in the Laiwu area, its Eighth Army has been annihilated by over 3,000 men in the Yexian area, and its Ninety-sixth Army has also been annihilated by over 2,000 men in the Mingshui area. Four Chiang planes were shot down. At present, over 100 li of the Zhou (cun)-Yi (du) section of the Jiaoji Railway, and its Zhang (dian)-Bo (shan) branch line, are entirely under the control of the People's Liberation Army. The important towns of Zichuan, Zouping, Yidu, Zhangdian, and Zhoucun were all liberated by the Eighth Route Army from the enemy puppets through bloody battles in August and September 1945. Since then, they have been repeatedly occupied by the Chiang army and changed hands several times, this being the fourth or fifth liberation.
    [New China News Agency, East China Front, dispatch of the 27th] In order to cooperate with the Laiwu campaign in central Shandong, the People's Liberation Army on the Jiaoji line annihilated over 2,000 men of the Provisional 13th Division of the 96th Army of the Chiang army in the Mingshui area (between Pujishan and Licheng) between the 22nd and 24th.
    [New China News Agency, Shandong, urgent telegram of the 27th] Li Xianzhou, the supreme commander of the Chiang army on the Lu South-North line and commander of the Second Pacification Zone of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, was captured by the East China People's Liberation Army in this battle in the Laiwu area north of Laiwu, in which seven divisions of the Chiang army were annihilated. At the same time, several Chiang army generals were also captured. (Attached picture)
