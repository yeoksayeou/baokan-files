    Production and Thrift Welcome the Bright Future
    Men Quit Smoking, Women Save Food
    Thrift Promoted in Taihang Villages
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The production and thrift movement is penetrating deep into the vast countryside in Taihang area. When Bei Lüxun Village in Lin County held a mass meeting on the first of this month to discuss production and thrift issues, women raised the difficulty of lacking capital for production. The men said, "Silver hairpins and jewelry, can't they be sold?" The women said, "Wearing them isn't wasteful, but you men smoking a cigarette costs five yuan, isn't that worse than anything?" Later, the men unanimously guaranteed to quit smoking cigarettes, and the women immediately took off their silver hairpins and jewelry and put them into the cooperative for production. On the same day, women in Beiliu Village, Licheng, also set out specific measures in the production and thrift discussion meeting: (1) Previously, they ate one part rice and one part flour or two parts rice and one part flour, but now they are all changed to four parts rice and one part flour, and also mixed with half corn flour. (2) Scattered work is concentrated in the evening, and each person spins an average of one or two more taels of cotton per day. (3) When cooking, calculate precisely to avoid wasting a single bite of food. After Comrade Peng Zhongjiang, a disabled and honored serviceman from Xiawu Village, Third District, Zuoquan, saw the news report that the leaders called for production and thrift to support the front lines, he immediately mobilized the farmers in the village to formulate production and thrift plans, helped rectify mutual aid, and sent a letter to the Zuoquan County Government to return his preferential treatment certificate. The letter stated: "Although I can no longer go to the front lines to fight Chiang Kai-shek, I will definitely respond to the leaders' call in the rear. I am willing to return all the supplies I should receive in order to reduce the burden on the people." The county government specially issued a notice to commend him.

    生产节约迎接光明
    男人戒纸烟主妇省食粮
    太行农村推行节约
    【本报综合报导】太行各地生产节约运动深入广大乡村。林县北捋寻村本月一日召开群众大会讨论生产节约问题时，妇女提出生产没资本的困难。男人们说：“银头卡、手饰，不能卖？”妇女们说：“带在手上不为浪费，你男人们吸根纸烟五块钱，比啥不厉害？”后来男人们一致保证不再吸纸烟，妇女当场取下银卡、手饰，入到合作社生产。同日，黎城北流村妇女亦在生产节约讨论会中订出具体办法：（一）从前吃一米一面或两米一面，现全改为四米一面，而且掺一半玉茭面。（二）零碎活集中到夜里，每人每天平均多纺一两花。（三）做饭时精确计算，做到不浪费一口饭。左权三区下武村残废荣誉军人彭忠江同志，见报载首长号召生产节约支援前线消息后，立即动员该村农民，订立生产节约计划，帮助整顿互助，并致函左权县府将领恤证卷退还。函称：“虽不能再上前线与蒋介石拚，在后方一定响应首长号召。我愿将应领一切供给全部退去，以减轻人民负担。”县府特通令表扬。
