　　[Report from this newspaper in Jilu and Yu on the 12th] After the farmers' congresses in various districts of Yanggu concluded, all 871 villages in the county launched struggles. Within seven days, a total of more than 2,100 liquidation struggles were carried out throughout the county, clearing out more than 61,000 mu of land. With the development of the struggle, mass organizations throughout the county grew from more than 42,000 people to more than 85,000, accounting for more than 24 percent of the county's total population. Farmers in the 105 villages of the new district obtained more than 8,000 mu of land, more than 720,000 jin of grain, and other livestock, carts, and mills. The 72 villages in the old 4th district recovered more than 7,000 mu of land and a great deal of other ill-gotten wealth. Currently, advanced villages have distributed all the ill-gotten wealth, and farmers in more than 90 villages throughout the county have been allocated land. The position of the basic masses in the countryside has been raised to an unprecedented level. Poor farmers who could not find wives for half their lives are now getting land, and relatives and neighbors are actively matchmaking. In Xini Village, in the first district, five of the fifteen bachelors in the whole village have married wives. The emancipated farmers have raised their consciousness, and after being notified of war support tasks, they have actively supported the front lines. In Dayang Village, they are very enthusiastic about providing stretchers this time, and Yang Qinghe voluntarily makes small beds. Women are also very active in the movement, and young girls of eighteen or nineteen have also stepped out of their homes. The 350,000 farmers throughout the county universally reflect: if it weren't for Chairman Mao, we really wouldn't have been able to get through the Spring Festival this year. The farmers are brewing to present plaques to the Communist Party to express their gratitude.
