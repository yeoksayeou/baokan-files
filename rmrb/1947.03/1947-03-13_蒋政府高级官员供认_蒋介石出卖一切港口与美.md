　　Senior Officials of the Chiang Government Confess:
    Chiang Kai-shek Sells All Ports to the US
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] According to the Shanghai News of the 13th of last month: Xiamen News, On the 6th of last month, Liu Shizhen, commander of the Kuomintang Xiamen Fortress, said in his talk with reporters about the procedures for foreign ships to enter and exit our coastal ports: "Generally, warships of other countries must obtain the consent of the Kuomintang Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense before they can enter the port; but the United States is an exception." Because the United States has a special "friendly" relationship with our country, its warships can freely travel to and from various coastal ports of our country without being restricted by international regulations." This is another confirmation that the Kuomintang government has sold all Chinese ports to American imperialism for its military use.

　　蒋政府高级官员供认
    蒋介石出卖一切港口与美
    【新华社延安十日电】据上月十三日沪报载：厦门消息，上月六日国民党厦门要港司令刘世桢，于其招待记者谈话中谈及外舰进出我国沿海口岸手续问题谓：“一般国家之军舰须事先经国民党外交部及国防部海军总司令部同意，始可入港；而独美国不然。“因美国与我国有特别‘友好’之邦交，其军舰得自由往来我国沿海各港口，而不受国际之约束”。又一次证实国民党政府已将中国一切港口，出卖给美国帝国主义供其军事用处。
