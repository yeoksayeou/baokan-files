　　Liberated Peasants Enthusiastically Produce
    Gaoping Handicraft Industry Revives
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] After the land reform in Gaoping, the handicraft industry has revived. Gaoping was originally a county in southeastern Shanxi with developed coal, iron, and handicraft industries, but it was completely bankrupted by the exploitation of Japanese invaders and the stubborn bandit Ji Zhenchang, the town mayor. After our army recovered Gaoping in 1945, the handicraft industry gradually recovered. After the land reform movement of the past year, the peasants who also engaged in handicrafts have become even more enthusiastic about production. At present, various industrial workshops in the county have recovered to two-thirds of their pre-war level. Yonglu Village is a village concentrated on paper production. Before the war, there were a total of 127 vats, and the income from its products accounted for one-half of the village's agricultural income. During the Japanese occupation, only eight vats were left, and they were often shut down. Now, 82 paper vats have been restored, accounting for two-thirds of the pre-war level. In addition, due to the improvement of workers' lives and the increase in output income, last year's income alone was about 150,000 yuan. Sanjia is a village concentrated on iron furnaces. Before the war, there were 37 furnaces, all of which were destroyed by the Japanese invaders. Since the recovery began last spring, 20 have been put into operation. Xizhou and Jizi produce copperware. When the enemy was there, no one was on the market. Last June, the masses raised 100,000 yuan to start the recovery. There are now 14 workers restoring the production of copper basins and other utensils, and have already made a profit of more than 400,000 yuan. It is still gradually recovering.

　　翻身农民热情生产
    高平手工业复活
    【本报太岳三日电】高平土地改革后手工业复活。高平原系晋东南煤铁及手工业发达的县份，但经日寇及顽匪姬镇长的压榨，全部破产。卅四年我军收复高平后，手工业便逐渐恢复；经过去年一年的土地改革运动后，兼营手工业的农民，生产情绪更高。现全县各种工业镊坊已恢复至战前水平的三分之二，永禄村是产纸集中的村庄，战前共一百廿七个池子，其出品收入占全村农业收入二分之一；日寇统治时期，仅留下八个池子，还经常停业，现在已恢复到八十二个纸池，占战前的三分之二。又由于工人生活改善，产量收入增加，仅去年收入即十五万元左右。三甲是铁炉集中的村庄，战前原有三十七座，日寇统治时全部被摧毁了。自去春开始恢复至今开工的已有廿座。西周、箕子出铜器，敌人在时已无一家上市，去年六月由群众集股十万元开始恢复，已有工人十四人恢复打铜盆等用具，并已获利四十万余元，现仍在逐渐恢复中。
