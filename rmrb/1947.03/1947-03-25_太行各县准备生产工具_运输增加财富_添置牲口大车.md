    Livestock and Carts Added
    [This newspaper Taihang News] After land reform, Taihang counties are striving to develop transportation, increase wealth, and overcome difficulties in spring plowing. According to preliminary statistics from six villages in Licheng, Xiyang, Heshun, and Shexian counties alone, 164 head of livestock and 47 carts have been added. Dongbei Village in Licheng County only had one cart in 1945. Last year, it added eight head of livestock and nine carts. The village has established a transportation team. Each ten carts traveling back and forth on the Handan-Changzhi Highway can earn one livestock and one cart, creating a village-wide upsurge in buying carts and livestock. As of the fifteenth day of the first lunar month this year, the village has added 42 carts and 41 head of livestock, earning a net profit of 3,990,500 Jichaos after expenses. Zhang Xiaowang's family alone earned a net profit of 150,000 yuan and two carts and two mules. Tanyin Village in Shexian County only had two head of livestock for transportation last spring. By the end of last year, the village had developed into a transportation team, adding 20 tall-legged mules. (Qiu Yuan)

    太行各县准备生产工具
    运输增加财富
    添置牲口大车
    【本报太行讯】太行各县在土地改革后努力发展运输，增加财富克服春耕困难。仅据黎城、昔阳、和顺、涉县四县六个村的初步统计，目前已增加牲口一百六十四头，大车四十七辆。黎城董北村在四五年只有大车一辆，去年增加牲口八头，大车九辆，该村已成立运输队。这样每十辆大车往返邯长公路一次，可赚牲口大车各一，造成全村买车买牲口的热潮。截至今年阴历正月十五日，该村已增加大车四十二辆，牲口四十一头，除开支外，净赚三百九十九万零五百元冀钞。仅张小旺一户就净赚十五万元及两辆车两个骡子。涉县弹音村全村去年春天只有两头牲口运输，到去年年底，该村已发展成一个运输队，增加高脚骡子二十头。（秋原）
