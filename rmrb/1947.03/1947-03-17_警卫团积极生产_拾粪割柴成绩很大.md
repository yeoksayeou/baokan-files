　　Guard Regiment Actively Engages in Production
    Achieves Great Results in Manure Collection and Firewood Gathering
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Guard Regiment's production and frugality campaign has unfolded enthusiastically. After discussions, each company has acted swiftly. Zhang Huiyou, a communication soldier from the Special Service Company, carried a basket to collect manure along the way while delivering letters. Li Weihua, a telephone operator from the telephone squad, carried electrical wires on one shoulder and a manure basket in the other. Combining work with manure collection, they collected 12,000 jin in ten days during their intense training. They also saved 104 towels, 59 pairs of shoes, and 19 pairs of socks. The Fifth Company requested to save all of their annual allowance rice, but the leadership estimated that they had many difficult situations, so they mobilized them to only save a portion. As a result, they saved 77 towels, 7 pairs of shoes, and 3 military uniforms. The Fourth Company launched a firewood gathering campaign. Comrades Duan Gongming, Li Yong'an, and Zhang Chenzi cut 420 jin of thatch in one afternoon. In February, they cut thatch for seven afternoons, totaling 42,900 jin, worth 214,500 yuan. Now, the Fourth Company's living conditions are much better than last winter's. The regiment headquarters also worked hard. The political office, under the personal leadership of Director Feng, accumulated a large pit of fertilizer in one afternoon. Therefore, the soldiers sang, "If you want to eat well, you must put in the effort!" This quick rhythmic song has become a slogan for action.

　　警卫团积极生产
    拾粪割柴成绩很大
    【本报讯】警卫团生产节约运动已热烈展开，各连经过讨论后已迅速的行动起来。特务连的通讯员张会友送信时都带了筐子沿途拾粪，电话班架线生李维华一肩肩了电线另手又提了粪筐，连工作带拾粪，他们在紧张练兵中十天就拾了一万二千斤；又节约毛巾一百零四条，鞋五十九对，袜子十九双。五连要求把整年的津贴米全部节约，但领导上估计他们都是困难事情多，动员他们只节约一部分，结果节约毛巾七十七条、鞋七双、军衣三件。四连开展了打柴运动，段公明、李永安、张臣子三同志一下午割茅柴四百二十斤，二月份他们共割了七个下午打了四万二千九百斤，价值二十一万四千五百元，现在四连的生活要比去冬的生活好多了。团直也同样的干了起来，政治处在冯主任的亲率下一下午积肥一大坑，所以战士们就唱出了“要想吃得好，劲要出个了！”这快板成了行动的口号。
