　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th】 After the Fushan Third District was raided by the enemy, the county headquarters promptly called for a revenge and meritorious service campaign. The spider web joint defense has been further restored and improved, severely damaging the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops who came out to harass. At the beginning of last month, the Fushan Third District's spider web joint defense was subjected to a sneak attack by Chiang's troops because a unit of militiamen was transferred to a distant expedition and district cadres went to the county for a meeting. Combat hero Cui Jinrong, Public Security Director Shan Sixu and his father, Armed Committee Instructor Shan Fengyun, Farmers' Association Chairman Cui Dengming and 63 other masses and militiamen bravely sacrificed themselves, and a portion of grain and livestock was lost. In order to change this situation, the county headquarters promptly called on the entire county to launch a revenge and meritorious service campaign for the victimized cadres and masses. It was decided that the week from the 18th to the 25th would be Revenge Week, and large teams of rotating combat teams would be organized to cooperate with district and village cadres, militiamen, and home-guard teams to form armed work teams for active operations. A general mass meeting was convened to organize all forces, thoroughly destroy transportation, re-block dangerous places with stone mines, and deploy snipers. The spider web joint defense has regained its powerful role. On the 20th, when the enemy went to Beichen to loot, they fell into the "spider web." The home-guard team of a certain village killed the stubborn director and special commissioner Duan Qingcheng, and captured one rifle and 900 rounds of ammunition. On the 23rd, the enemy in Beichenpo triggered a joint defense stone mine, and the enemy's affairs chief was seriously injured. On the evening of the 25th, the enemy concentrated more than 200 people and launched a surprise attack on the direction of Erfeng Mountain in two routes. When they passed Beichen, they stepped on a mine and injured two more people. Another group, from Xiangguan and Guanli to Qiaoma, encountered a mobile group sent by the home-guard team of a certain village. The home-guard team injured three enemies with two grenades. The enemy fled in embarrassment. Summarizing the week's offensive, a total of 11 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops were killed or wounded, and the enemy was pushed back to within five li of the city.
