Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th: A unit of the Democratic Allied Army recaptured the county seat of Huinan County, Andong Province, on the 4th. In the battle, more than 800 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including the regimental commander of the Provisional 21st Division of the 60th Army, were captured alive.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 8th: Belated news: The People's Liberation Army on the Lunan front recovered Beizhuang, thirty li northeast of Zaozhuang, on the 1st of this month. This area was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's 77th Reorganized Division on February 27th. After a fierce counterattack by the People's Liberation Army, the Chiang Kai-shek troops abandoned the battle and fled in disarray. The People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy to the Huangshan area (more than 20 li northeast of Zaozhuang), inflicting heavy casualties on the Chiang Kai-shek troops. A total of more than 500 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than 50 enemy soldiers, including a deputy battalion commander, were captured alive. Fourteen light and heavy machine guns, six small cannons, and a large quantity of rifles and ammunition were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th: Democratic order has been rapidly established in the newly recovered cities along the Jiaoji Railway. On the second day after the liberation of Boshan, the democratic government entered and exited the city to conduct official business, and order in urban and rural areas returned to normal, with people living and working in peace. In Zichuan, prices have stabilized due to the democratic government's transportation of large quantities of grain and salt; at the Wanren market in Xiguan on the 3rd, grain and cloth prices fell sharply by one-third to one-half compared to before. The coal mine power plant was fully restored by the workers within four hours of liberation, and water and electricity were supplied as usual. The lights in the Hongshan Town area shone brightly at night, like daylight. The Yidu Democratic Government spares no effort in protecting private enterprises, and all industries in the city have reopened. The democratic government, considering Chiang Kai-shek's currency as worthless, set up an exchange office, exchanging 20.055 million yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's currency in one day. Merchants and people were grateful for this measure, which relieved the people's greatest suffering. More than 500 family-run cigarette handicraft businesses in the city, which had been shut down due to Chiang Kai-shek's oppression, are now resuming operations. The Yexian Democratic Government has successively distributed 20,000 jin of relief grain and a large quantity of clothing to disaster victims, and has also allocated agricultural loans of 1 million yuan (each yuan totaling 15 yuan) to help farmers restore production.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 8th: The People's Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Mancheng County, west of the Ping-Han Railway, on the 2nd of this month. The Chiang Kai-shek troops who invaded the city included the 95th Brigade of the 94th Army and the 53rd Army, which were originally stationed on the Ping-Han Railway, as well as a part of the 35th Army of the 12th War Zone, which was transferred from Chahar.
