Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 12th. The Jin-Southwest Democratic Government recently issued 80 million yuan in agricultural currency (each yuan equivalent to 1.2 yuan in Chiang currency) and 20,000 jin of cotton as interest-free loans to impoverished farmers in Yonghe, Xi County, Fenxi, Shilou and other eight counties who have suffered long-term devastation under Yan Xishan. On the foundation of land reform, they are making every effort to organize the masses to restore rural production, with the main directions being to expand cultivated land area, promote cotton planting, and develop textile production. Farmers in the aforementioned counties plan to reclaim 540,000 mu of wasteland this year, plant 110,000 mu of cotton, and weave 162,000 bolts of cloth. The government calls on each laborer to cultivate ten mu of wasteland and plant half a mu of cotton, and for each adult woman to weave three bolts of cloth. It also organizes the masses to help each other solve production difficulties. Trade organizations and shops in various towns have transported large quantities of oxen, farm tools, and seeds from old liberated areas to supply farmers for spring plowing. Government organs at all levels have also organized manpower and animal power to help the local masses with farming as part of their own production tasks.

    【新华社晋绥十二日电】晋西南民主政府近发放八万万元农币（每元合蒋币一元二角）和两万斤棉花无利贷给遭受阎锡山长期蹂躏的永和、隰县、汾西、石楼等八县贫苦农民。在土地改革的基础上，全力组织群众恢复农村生产，其主要方向为扩大耕地面积，推广植棉，发展纺织。上述各县农民计划今年垦荒五十四万亩，植棉十一万亩，织布十六万二千匹。政府号召每个劳动力垦荒十亩，植棉半亩，每个成年妇女织布三匹，并组织群众互助解决生产困难。各城镇贸易机关和商店从老区运来大批耕牛农具种籽，供给农民春耕。政府各机关并组织人畜力帮助驻地群众耕作，作为本身生产任务之一。
