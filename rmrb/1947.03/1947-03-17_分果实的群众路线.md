    Methods of Distributing Fruits of Victory

    There are various ways to distribute the fruits of victory. The distribution of confiscated wealth is mostly based on the family circumstances of each class and household, first assessing grades or scores, and then distributing the fruits of victory proportionally.

    The grading methods include three grades and nine levels, three grades and six levels, six grades and eighteen levels, three grades and sixty points (each point being a small level), and six grades and forty-five points. The most complex ones have as many as eighty-five points. Simpler ones include single six grades and single three grades (single three grades only exist in individual villages in Linzhang). Among them, the implementation of three grades and nine levels and three grades and six levels is the most common. The more levels there are, the more reasonable it is, and the more beneficial it is to the poor peasants.

    In order to ensure that poor peasants receive the fruits of victory, the grades are generally divided according to the following categories: extremely poor military families and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed; lower-poor peasants; middle-poor peasants; middle peasants; middle-rich peasants; and rich-middle peasants. Poor peasants are ranked at the high level, and middle peasants are ranked at the low level. Although poor peasants have fewer households and fewer people, they can still exceed the amount received by middle peasants. For example, in Zhai Village in the southern district of Yongnian, six grades and forty-five points were determined: rich-middle peasants scored one to three, middle-middle peasants four to six, poor-middle peasants one to five, poor peasants sixteen to twenty-five, extremely poor twenty-six to thirty-five, and lower-poor military families and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed thirty-six to forty-five points. As a result of this distribution, the 250 poor peasants received 60% of all the fruits of victory, while the 700 middle peasants received 40% of the fruits of victory. Furthermore, the disparity between rich-middle peasants and middle-middle peasants was not too great, which could reduce their dissatisfaction.

    After the grades are divided, most of the distribution is calculated and allocated according to population. Some are allocated by household, which is disadvantageous to those with larger families, while allocation by person is disadvantageous to those with smaller families. In this regard, most considerations are also given, some by increasing the score level, and some by considering population increases and decreases. For example, some villages in Handan calculated based on population, with households of one person counted as two, households of two people counted as three, households of three to eight people counted according to the original number, households of nine counted as eight, and households of ten counted as nine, and so on. Some used a combination of person and household methods, such as first allocating 30% of the fruits of victory according to population, and then allocating 70% of the fruits of victory according to household grading. Individual villages (in the fourth district of Handan) allocated all the fruits of victory to each class according to their composition, and then each class made specific allocations. Some villages determined that poor peasants would receive 70% and middle peasants 30%, or 30% was allocated per person and 70% according to grades.

    However, in many regions or villages, our leading cadres did not have a clear understanding of the principles of filling gaps and making up deficiencies for poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants, and failed to grasp them well. Their understanding of class division was unclear (such as simply dividing based on land), resulting in middle peasants receiving a lot of fruits of victory, which hindered the resolution of the problems of poor peasants; or middle peasants received too little, which also hindered the unity with middle peasants.

    Regarding the specific methods of distributing the fruits of victory, most of them assessed the value of the fruits and distributed them to the masses according to the amount of money. Some made "emancipation tickets" or "farmers' association tickets" for the masses to purchase. When auctioning the fruits of victory, poor peasants were given priority to choose, ensuring that essential tools were in the hands of poor peasants. Some adopted an allocation method, allocating according to the needs of each class, and assessing low prices to take care of poor peasants.

    The distribution of fruits of victory is generally determined by the masses, who decide on the methods, assess the grades, and create a score list, which is then submitted to the masses for full discussion. Based on the circumstances of each household, they compare each other, make suggestions for modifications, and then distribute. However, due to the hasty work in grading in many areas during the movement, some village cadres handled it without assessment, without pricing, and distributed it based on estimates. Some villages sold the fruits of victory for cash and then distributed it, which was disadvantageous to poor peasants because they had no money, and the fruits of victory were sold to middle peasants, causing great losses to poor peasants.

    Regarding the distribution of land and houses, the principle of filling gaps and making up deficiencies was implemented, with specific slogans such as "filling gaps and making up deficiencies," "filling up from the bottom, not from the top," "land and houses without pricing," "compensating the near with the far," and "compensating the lean with the fertile," compensating from the bottom up. The poorest peasants obtained the most land. Villages that had undergone mass movements generally eliminated extreme poverty and most of the poor peasants. Only a few villages with little land or insufficient mass mobilization also eliminated some extreme poverty. Except for a very few villages with too little land, generally, everyone had more than three mu of land.

    After the poor peasants filled the gaps and made up the deficiencies, the remaining land was used to supplement the poor-middle peasants and middle-middle peasants. For example, in Hanzhai Village, there were 18 extremely poor households, 40 poor peasant households, 39 poor-middle peasant households, 90 middle peasant households, and 37 rich-middle peasant households. In addition to supplementing each of the extremely poor, poor peasant, and poor-middle peasant households to 4.45 mu per person, 45 middle peasant households were also supplemented to 4.45 mu.

    Land distribution is a meticulous task, generally going through the following steps: clearing the land (fruits of victory land), calculating the compensation (original land of each household), assessing and allocating, and writing contracts.

    Similarly, in the distribution of land, some villages did not implement the principle of filling gaps and making up deficiencies. In the early stages of the mass movement, due to insufficient leadership control, some villages distributed land at a price like confiscated wealth. In the later stages of the movement, in the third district of Daming, some still distributed land and houses at a price, which made it impossible for poor peasants to get land and wealth at the same time. If they got wealth, they would have to reduce the amount of land, which disadvantaged poor peasants.

  Consideration and Rewards in Distributing Fruits of Victory

    The consideration for revolutionary soldiers' and workers' families has been relatively good, because the leaders at all levels have a relatively clear understanding in their thinking. In the distribution of confiscated wealth, the military families are generally raised by one level according to their original class, and the entire family of the military personnel is raised uniformly. This can solve some problems. For example, in the case of distribution of the fruits of victory according to need, a military family has twelve people, and each person is raised by one level, which increases by nine points. Each point is 615 yuan. The amount of care alone is 71,908 yuan. Adding the number of points that should be obtained, a total of more than 130,000 yuan is obtained. The care is also inconsistent, according to the revolutionary martyrs, the army, the working class, and the number of years of participation in the revolution. As long as the mass line is followed, the care will be very correct.

    Consideration was also given in the distribution of land. Because the amount of land contested in each village was different, the consideration was also inconsistent. Some had more than doubled the number of supplements, and some had half a mu of land more per person according to the population.

    The calculation of care for military dependents is quite inconsistent. Most are calculated according to the entire family population, some are calculated according to one soldier, and some are calculated according to direct relatives. Relatively speaking, it is easy to not give enough care if the fruits of victory are given per household. For example, if the level is raised by one level, the number of this level is limited. If it is raised by population, the number multiplied by this level is larger. Calculating according to one soldier gives the worst care, forming a soldier's improvement, and losing the meaning of preferential treatment. Calculation by direct relatives is more reasonable. Uncles and aunts should not enjoy the same preferential treatment. Anyone living with non-direct relatives should offer it to the public, otherwise, within the family of a revolutionary soldier, disputes over property and labor may arise due to the fruits of victory.

    Care for the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed is also very common, but it is worse compared to military dependents. In the distribution of confiscated wealth, most of them use additional points or level promotions to take care of land allocation. Some also specially take care of the land and houses in order to completely solve their production problems, and are generally lower than the resistance to the family in wealth. Because there is no productivity, there are also many lands that have not been taken care of, which is wrong. We should take more care of them in terms of land.

    The most basic issue in rewarding village cadres and activists is to mobilize the masses to reward them politically. Only in this way can the material requirements of village cadres be reduced. Material rewards must follow the mass line. For example, in Beiwangzhuang Village, Yongnan District, the cadres of the farmers' association decided on their own to "reward" each person with one stone of wheat and the director with one stone and five dou without passing through the masses, resulting in mass dissatisfaction. If it is rewarded through the masses, the number is not easy to be too large, and it should not be a general reward, turning the reward into employment. The number of fruits of victory rewarded and the number rewarded per person are best discussed and elected by the masses and rewarded according to merit, so that the cadres will not be dissatisfied. On the contrary, forming employment, the masses do not agree, and problems are prone to occur within the village cadres due to unfair rewards. We propose that the principle of rewarding village cadres and militias should not exceed the number of care for military dependents. If the rewards for village cadres and militias are high, and the care for military dependents is low, military-civilian disputes will arise due to unreasonableness.

    The main problem is to strengthen cadre education, overcome the idea of pride in credit, showing off old qualifications to the masses, and that those with great merit should get more fruits of victory. At the same time, educate the masses to support the village cadres and launch a support-cadre movement in a timely manner. Replacing material rewards with political rewards can strengthen the unity between cadres and the masses.

  The Mass Line in Distributing Fruits of Victory

    Distributing the fruits of victory is a very important issue in the mass movement. It is the issue that every mass is most concerned about. Whether the fruits of victory are distributed reasonably or not is the key to determining the unity of the masses, and it is also the key to the success or failure of the entire mass movement. To make the distribution of fruits of victory reasonable and fair, it is necessary to implement the mass line and fully implement democracy, so that the masses can solve the problems themselves.

    Walking the mass line is to enable the masses to discuss and solve problems themselves, but the guiding role of leadership must be strengthened, the policies must be pointed out to the masses in advance, and the principles must be put forward as enlightenment to the masses, so that the masses have something to follow. If principles are not put forward for the masses to discuss, unnecessary differences will occur due to different personal interests, and the concentration of correct opinions will be hindered. We will never abandon leadership in opposition to being monopolized, and will not guide in principle.

    What principles should be paid attention to in the distribution of fruits of victory? First of all, the class ideology of the masses must be clarified in the division of classes, and secondly, how to fill gaps and make up deficiencies so that poor peasants can get more fruits of victory, but it is also necessary to unite with middle peasants. In order to achieve the "fast," "clean," and "fair" distribution of fruits of victory, the principles and policies must first be given to the masses, and then concentrated after discussion by the masses. In the entire process of distributing the fruits of victory, regardless of the determination of methods, the assessment of grades, various considerations and rewards, methods, and the specific handling of various issues, they must be passed through the masses and decided by the masses according to the principles. We cannot think that the masses are incompetent and find it troublesome and time-consuming.

    Walking the mass line must also pay attention to the leadership of poor peasant backbones, because middle peasants generally account for the majority of the masses. If the leadership only puts forward principles and lets the masses discuss on their own, it is easy to pass a division that is beneficial to middle peasants and harms the interests of poor-middle and poor peasants. Therefore, in the leadership organizations for distributing the fruits of victory—the farmers' association and the evaluation committee—poor peasants must be allowed to participate in the leadership more, and at the same time, representatives of all classes must be allowed to participate, to realize poor peasant leadership, and to inspire and educate poor peasants to actively fight for the support of middle peasants, so as to ensure the realization of the above principles. Practice has proved that in the distribution of fruits of victory, middle peasants will not agree to poor peasants getting more, advocating equal distribution according to population, and land and houses at the same price, and compete with poor peasants for the fruits of victory, while poor peasants will have the idea of excluding middle peasants and not allowing middle peasants to share the fruits of victory. The leadership must grasp in time, ensure that poor peasants get more, solve the problems of poor peasants, and unite with middle peasants.

　　分果实的群众路线
    冀南分社
    分果实的办法
    分果实是多种多样的，分配浮财大都是按各阶层、各户之家庭状况，先评定等级或分数，把果实按份分配的。
    评定等级有三等九级、三等六级、六等十八级、三等六十分（每分即一小级），六等四十五分，最复杂的多至有八十五分。简单的有单六等单三等的（单三等的全区只在临漳有个别村）。其中以执行三等九级及三等六级为最多，等级越多就越合理，就越有利于贫农。
    为了保证贫农分得果实，一般都是按极贫军属与老弱孤寡、下贫贫农、贫中农、中富农、富中农划分等级，贫农列于高级，把中农列于低级，贫农虽然户少人少，也能超过中农所得数。如永年南区寨村，确定六等四十五分，富中农为一至三、中中农四至六、贫中农一至五，贫农一六至二五，极贫二六至三五，下贫军属及老弱孤寡三六至四五分。这样分配结果，贫农人二五一口，分得全部果实的百分之六十，中农人七百口，分得果实百分之四十，并且两富中农中中农的悬殊不太大，可以减少他们的不满。
    划分等级之后，多数又都是按人口计算分配，有些是按户为单位分配，按户则人多的吃亏，按人则人少者吃亏，这方面多半也作了照顾，有的从提高分数等级照顾。有从人口增减上照顾，如邯郸有些村庄以人口计算，全家一口人者按二口分，二口人按三口人分，三口至八口者按原人数，九口者按八口分，十口者按九口分，依次类推。有的按人户兼用办法，如先抽果实百分之三十铺的按人口分配，再把果实百分之七十，按户评定等级分配。有个别村庄（邯郸四区），是把全部果实按成份分给各阶层，再由各阶层具体分配。有的村确定贫农分百分之七十，中农分百分之三十，或按人铺的百分之三十，按等级分百分之七十。
    但也有不少地区或村庄，由于我们领导干部对贫农填平补齐及团结中农原则认识不明确，未能很好掌握，划分阶层了解不清（如单纯按土地划分），结果使中农得到果实很多，妨碍解决贫农问题；或中农分得太少，也妨碍对中农的团结。
    关于分果实的具体办法，多半是将果实评定价格按钱数分给群众，有的制出“翻身票”“农会票”交群众买取。在拍卖果实时，先尽贫农拣选，保证必须用具到贫农手里，有经过配给形式，按各阶层需要配给。评议低价，以照顾贫农。
    分配果实一般是由群众决定办法、评定等级，作出分数榜，再交群众充分讨论。根据各户情况，互相比较，提出意见加以修改，然后分配。但因运动中不少地区评议等级工作作的了草，有的村干包办不评议，不定价，按估计数分配，有的村将果实变卖现款再行分配，这样贫农无钱，而把果实作卖价给中农，使贫农吃亏很大。
    关于土地房屋的分配，都执行了填平补齐的原则，具体口号“填平补齐”“下齐上不齐”“房地不作价”“有远补近”“有近补远”“有瘦补肥”等自下而上补齐，赤贫贫农获得土地最多。凡经过群众运动的村庄，一般都消灭了赤贫，消灭了大部分贫农，只有少数村庄土地少，或群众发动不充分，也消灭了一部分赤贫。除极少数村庄土地太少外，一般的都在每人三亩地以上。
    贫农填平补齐之后，并将余下土地往上补，给贫中农和中中农，如韩寨村赤贫十八户，贫农四十户，贫中农三十九户，中农九十户，富中农三七户，除将赤贫、贫农、贫中农每人补齐四·四五亩外，并给四十五户中农一补足四·四五亩。
    土地分配是细密的工作，一般是经过下列步骤：清理土地（果实地），计算补齐（各户原有地），评议补拨，书写文契。
    同样在分配土地中，也有某些村子不根据填平补齐原则执行的。在群运初期，由于领导上掌握不够，有些村庄和浮财一样把土地作价分配。在运动后期，大名三区，有的仍把土地房屋作价分配，这都使贫农分土地分不了浮财，分浮财则少要土地，这样分配贫农吃亏。
  分果实中的照顾与奖励问题
    对烈军工属的照顾，由于各级领导思想上比较明确，作的是比较好，分配浮财时一般的军属按原阶层提高一级，按军属全家人口一律提高，这样是可以解决一部分问题的。如在按需分果实时，一户军属有十二口人，每人提高一级增加九分，每分为六一五元，仅照顾数即为七一九○八元，加上应分数，共得到一三○○○○多元，在照顾中根据烈军、军、工属及参加革命的年限不同，照顾也不一致，只要走群众路线，照顾就会很正确的。
    分配土地也作了照顾，由于各村斗争土地多少不等，照顾也不一致，多的有超过补齐数一倍的，有按人口每人多分半亩地的。
    照顾军属的计算颇不一致，多数按全家人口计算的，有按军人一人计算的，有按直系亲属计算的，比较起来，分果实按户照顾容易照顾不够，譬如提高一级，这一级的数目是有限的，如按人口提高，把这一等乘起来数目就大了。按军人一人计算照顾最差，形成了军人提高，失掉了优军意义。按直系亲属比较合理，伯叔则不应同等享受优待，凡与非直系亲属同居者，应提供其为公有，不然，抗属一家之内会因果实而引起争财产争劳动的纠纷。
    照顾老弱孤寡户也很普遍，但与军属比较起来是较差的，在分浮财上多半以加分或提级照顾分配土地，也有的为了彻底解决其生产问题，在土地房屋上特别作了照顾，在浮财上一般都低于抗属。因无生产力，土地也有很多没有照顾的，这是不对的，我们应从土地上更多照顾才是对的。
    奖励村干及积极分子，最基本问题是动员群众多从政治上奖励，只有如此才减少村干部对物质的要求，物质奖励必须走群众路线，如永南区北王庄村，农会干部不经群众通过自己决定“奖励”，自己每人一石麦子，主任一石五斗，结果造成群众不满。如通过群众奖励，数目不易太多，更不可一般奖励，把奖励变成雇佣。奖励果实数目和每人奖励数目，最好经群众讨论、选举、按功行赏，这样干部不会不满意。相反的形成雇佣，群众不同意，村干内部也易因奖励不公发生问题。对村干民兵的奖励，我们提出原则不应超过对军属的照顾数，如村干民兵奖励多，而照顾军属少，会因不合理产生军民纠纷。
    主要问题加强干部教育，克服骄傲居功、向群众摆老资格，功劳大应多得果实的思想，同时教育群众拥护村干，及时开展拥干运动。以政治奖励代替物质奖励，这样可以加强干部与群众团结。
  分果实中的群众路线
    分果实是群运中十分重要的问题，是每个群众所最关心的问题，果实分的合理与否，是决定群众团结的关键，也是整个群众运动成败的关键。要使果实分得合理与公平，必须贯彻走群众路线、充分实行民主，使群众自己解决问题。
    走群众路线是使群众自己讨论解决问题，但必须加强领导上的指导作用，预先向群众指明政策，提出原则，作为对群众的启发，使群众有所遵循。如不提出原则使群众讨论，因个人的利益不同，会发生不必要的分歧和防碍正确意见的集中。我们绝不以反对包办就放弃领导，不在原则上指导。
    在分果实中应注意那些原则呢？首先在划分阶层中使群众的阶级思想明确起来，其次是如何填平补齐，使贫农多得果实，而又必须团结中农。为作到果实分配的“快”“净”“公”，必先把原则与政策交给群众，经群众研讨后再集中上来，在整个分配果实过程中，无论办法确定，等级的评议，各种照顾与奖励，方法方式以及各个问题的具体处理，都须通过群众，由群众根据原则，讨论决定，我们不能认为群众无能，嫌麻烦费事。
    走群众路线，还必须注意贫农骨干的领导问题，因为群众中一般是中农占多数，如果领导上只提出原则让群众自己讨论，就容易通过有利于中农的分割，而损害贫中、贫农利益，所以在分果实的领导组织——农会及评议会中，要使贫农多参加领导，同时让各阶层的代表参加，实现贫农领导，并启发教育贫农积极活动，争取中农赞助，才可以保证实现上述原则。实际证明，在分果实中，中农会不同意贫农多分，主张按人口均分，房地均作价，而与贫农争夺果实，贫农则会发生排斥中农，不让中农分果实的思想，领导上必须及时掌握，保证贫农多得，解决贫农问题，而又可以团结中农。
