    [This newspaper, Taihang, 19th dispatch] Hesun District One Gouzhang area (including eight administrative villages), a remote mountain area, has opened up a "backward" situation after universal training, and farmers are automatically turning over. Most of the residents in this area are guest residents, the land is barren and the people are poor. Although it is an old area, the farmers have not yet turned over, and the feudal forces still control the village administration. The lives of the farmers are extremely painful. Of the 663 households in the whole valley, 416 have nothing to eat. Most people have no mats on their beds, several people share a tattered quilt, and many sleep with stones as pillows. In Gaocun Village, Li Sanbao has no clothes or quilts, only a sheepskin, which he wears during the day and covers at night, and lights pine torches (pine branches). Many tenancy relationships remain unchanged. For example, there are 18 mu of rented land in a village in Shitou Gou. Last year, the farmer Zhang Sanbao asked the village cadres to reduce rent four times, but no one paid attention to him. The masses said behind their backs: "When the Japanese were here, the district cadres were better, but it has been two years since liberation, and they never come. Other villages are singing against Xuzhou (referring to turning over), but we often sing funeral songs (meaning pain). There is no hope for turning over in this life!" This situation was not discovered in the past because the county and district cadres failed to go deep into the mountain villages. After the district training, the awareness of the mountain villagers was raised, and they told the truth one by one. The district cadres were shocked, so the deputy secretary of the sub-committee led eight cadres to make a surprise attack. They first supported the masses and made decisions for them, and removed the 11 landlord elements who were stealing the village administration. Then they launched a liquidation campaign against all landlords. In less than ten days, the farmers recovered a total of 628 mu of land, 217 rooms, 86 shi of grain, 566 silver dollars, and many livestock, pigs, sheep, and furniture. With the help of the district cadres, more than 70 households have moved to wealthy villages near the city, and more than 50 shi of grain and more than 60,000 silver dollars have been transferred from wealthy villages in the whole district for unified distribution. All the poor peasants in the valley have been promoted to middle peasants. Now the district leaders are launching a movement of "a handful of rice" throughout the district to solve the spring famine in the Gouzhang area (this area had a poor harvest last year) and encourage them to actively produce.
    [This newspaper, Wu'an dispatch] The re-examination movement in the Fourth District of Wu'an since last month was launched after overcoming the cadres' complacency and the idea of simply engaging in internal affairs. At the beginning of the movement, most of the village cadres and activists felt that there was no more land to be found, so they led some of the masses to engage in internal affairs alone, which prevented the movement from going deeper. In order to overcome this bias, the leaders convened a meeting of work team leaders, emphasizing that land investigation should be the main task, and launching a general liquidation campaign against feudal landlords. They emphasized mobilizing the backward, holding meetings of honest poor and hired peasants and new activists in separate base points, and proposing that old agreements should be re-established with new contracts to thoroughly find out the hidden land of landlords; to tell all the sufferings, vent all the anger, dig out the roots of poverty, remove the heart disease, and completely separate from the landlords. After the meeting, they returned to their villages, colluded with the backward, and formed a new leading group dominated by poor and hired peasants and supported by cadres—the Land Investigation Committee. Immediately, a general liquidation campaign focusing on land investigation was launched. In ten days, 2,524 mu of hidden land of landlords were found, 4,210 red contracts were recovered in 25 villages, 15 books of "changing the sky" accounts, 15 guns, 322 rooms, and 5 livestock.

    和顺沟掌偏僻村庄经过普训打开局面
    武安四区发动贫雇查田总清算
    【本报太行十九日电】和顺一区沟掌一带（包括八个行政村）偏僻山地，经过普训打开了“落后”局面，农民自动闹翻身。这一地区居民多为客民、地瘠民贫，虽为老区，但农民至今仍未翻身，封建势力仍然窃掌村政，农民生活极其痛苦，全沟共六百六十三户，当下没有吃的就有四百十六户，多数人家炕上没席铺，好几个人伙盖一条破被，枕石头睡觉的很多。郜家庄有个李三保，无衣无被，只有一张羊皮，白天穿、夜里盖、点的是松灯（松树枝）。不少租佃关系仍原封未动，如石门沟一个庄上就有十八亩租地。去年农民张三保曾向村干部四次要求减租，终无人理。群众背后说：“日本在时，区干部还好来，解放后二年啦，总不见来，人家各村是唱反徐州（指翻身），咱们常唱哭灵堂（痛苦之意），翻身这辈也无指望”！这种情况过去由于县区干部工作未能深入山庄，始终未发现。该区集训后，山庄农民觉悟提高，才一一诉出，区干部大吃一惊，遂由分委书记带领八个干部去突击，他们首先给群众撑腰作主，把窃掌村政的十一个地主分子打下台，接着即向所有地主展开清算，不到十天，农民共收回土地六百二十八亩、房二百一十七间、粮八十六石、银洋五百六十六元及许多牲口猪羊家具。在区干部帮助下，七十余户已移到城附近富裕村庄，并从全区富村调剂给粮食五十余石，大洋六万余元，统一分配后，全沟贫农均升为中农。现区领导上正在全区发动一把米运动，解决沟掌一带的春荒（这带去年歉收），鼓励他们积极生产。
    【本报武安讯】武安四区上月以来的复查运动，是在克服了干部的自满情绪、简单搞内货思想后掀起的。运动开始，大部村庄干部积极分子都觉得土地没啥了，便带领部分群众单搞内货，使运动不能深入。领导上为克服这一偏向，乃召开工作组长会议；强调以查田为主，对封建地主展开总清算；强调发动落后，分基点召开老实贫雇农和新积极分子会，提出要老约立新契，彻底查出地主隐蔽地；诉尽苦、出尽气、挖穷根、去心病、彻底与地主分家等口号。会后各自回到本村，串通落后，组成以贫雇为主、干部撑腰的新领导集团——查田委员会。随即普遍展开查田为主的总清算，十天中，查出地主隐蔽地二千五百二十四亩，二十五个村要回红契四千二百一十张，变天账十五本，枪十五支，房三百二十二间，牲口五头。
