　　This Newspaper Convenes Meeting of Correspondents from Nearby Institutions
    Symposium on Institutional Reporting Work
    Comrade Wu Min Points Out Current Focus Should be on Vigorously Reporting the Production and Thrift Movement
    [This Newspaper News] On March 2nd, this newspaper convened a meeting of correspondents from nearby institutions at its station to discuss institutional reporting work (the Production and Thrift Movement and others). Thirty-eight people attended, including correspondents from various directly subordinate institutions at the border region level and responsible comrades from this newspaper. Editor-in-Chief Comrade Wu Min pointed out: Reporting work has already played a significant role in the development of the Production and Thrift Movement. It is hoped that correspondents will use even greater strength in the future to assist the leaders of various institutions in publicizing, organizing, and supervising, so that this movement can be sustained and developed. 1. Actively participate in the Production and Thrift Movement, doing what is written and writing what is done; 2. Proactively cooperate and assist the leadership; 3. Write to the newspaper about individual production plans of institutions, write about the implementation of plans, write about typical examples, write about creations (including organizational and technical ones), write about experiences, and write about merit-making movements. Correspondents should become the propagandists, organizers, and promoters of the movement. Comrade An Gang, head of the Communications Department, said: Since the Production and Thrift Movement, the number of institutional correspondents has doubled. In particular, Comrades Meiling (Military Region), Zhao Xiushan, Zhou Fang, Jiang Dongping (Border Government), Wang Jingran (Bank), Mao Maochun (Xinhua Bookstore) and others have enthusiastically written for this newspaper, which are all good phenomena. Subsequently, eight correspondents, including Jiang Dongping and Cui, spoke. The main opinions were: 1. Ideologically clarify the importance of reporting work, and work harder in the future. 2. Reporting must be completely true and should not have any exaggerations. 3. News must be reviewed by the responsible comrade of the institution after it is written in order to be perfected. 4. It is hoped that the responsible comrades of various institutions will lead and supervise the reporting work of their institutions. 5. Commend good news and good correspondents in the newspaper as examples for everyone to learn from. After the meeting, a dinner was held. (Leng Bing)
