    Yongxing Printing Bureau's Entire Staff 獻工獻金 to Support the Front Lines
    [Report from this newspaper] The Yongxing Printing Bureau has launched a campaign to increase production, conserve resources, and step up support for the front lines. More than 130 employees of the Second Branch Factory have contributed 470 workdays and 254,000 yuan. They have voluntarily increased their working hours from eight to nine hours per day. Zhang Shoutan, a young worker in the Machine Department, contributed 25,000 yuan and volunteered one workday per month, resolving production issues in his spare time. Zhao Yunhui, Yang Jinting, Li Wenchang, and others subscribed to five to ten issues of "New Masses" each to comfort the front-line troops. In the past ten days or so, the factory's overall production efficiency has increased by 11%. The output of the double-folio machines has exceeded the production standard by 30%. For example, the printing of this newspaper has increased from an average of 750 copies per hour in the past to 1,000 copies now. Each employee in the First Branch Factory has contributed an average of one day of voluntary work per month; some have pledged to contribute until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. On average, one-quarter of the workers have given up their holidays every Sunday. In terms of monetary contributions, Director Wang Hua has donated all of his annual subsidy of more than 1,500 catties of rice. Comrades in the proofreading section, who never participated in movements before, have become leaders in this support-the-front-lines movement after studying the "mass line." For example, Comrade Hao Cen donated all 170 catties of his March rice subsidy, except for what he needed for food. All the factory's employees firmly believe that the March production target (1.1 million characters) will be exceeded. In terms of quality, the error rate in typesetting has been reduced to less than ten errors per ten thousand characters, and Song Jigong has achieved the highest record of only two or three errors per ten thousand characters. In order to save paper, ink, and labor, employees have created various new methods for correcting errors. For example, when errors are found on paper plates, they are moistened with water and then re-struck; when errors are found on lead plates, the lead characters are chiseled off. In the past half month, the factory has gained experience in enriching and sustaining the movement: 1. Continuously conduct current affairs education; 2. Group production and individual output registration; 3. Regular inspections and rewards, etc. (Bing)
