Taiwan Autonomy Movement

The peaceful autonomy movement of the Taiwanese people has been forced into self-defense due to the armed massacre by the Chiang Kai-shek government. By the 8th of this month, it had developed into an armed struggle. The February 28th Incident Handling Committee, organized by the Taiwanese people, passed the "Proposal for Reforming Taiwan Province's Politics" in thirty-two articles and issued an order to establish a political affairs bureau before March 15th, with its members to be elected by universal suffrage of the people of Taiwan Province. At the same time, it ordered the acceptance of the four major family-owned enterprises in Taiwan operating under the name of "public ownership" by the Chiang government. After the incident on the 8th, Chiang Kai-shek not only did not repent but intensified his armed offensive; two divisions, the 21st and 20th, were sent to Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek also dispatched Bai Chongxi, Zhu Shaoliang, and others to Taiwan to command. Chiang Kai-shek's intention is clearly to drown the autonomy movement of the Taiwanese people in blood.

If we briefly review the history of Taiwan's development after the victory against Japan, we can see that the Taiwan autonomy movement is completely reasonable, legal, and peaceful, and its transformation into an armed struggle was entirely forced by Chiang Kai-shek. The savagery of Chiang Kai-shek's rule over Taiwan exceeded that of Japanese imperialism. The life of the Taiwanese people under Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule was even more painful than being enslaved by Japanese imperialism. Many Chinese and foreign journalists who visited Taiwan pointed this out long ago. The four families of Chiang, Kong, Song, and Chen completely monopolized Taiwan's economy through confiscation and monopoly. This group of Chinese feudal fascists plundered the Taiwanese people so cruelly that they left them virtually no chance of survival. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's desperate civil war, including conscription and grain requisition in Taiwan, has made it even more impossible for the Taiwanese people to survive. The demands of the Taiwanese people are extremely ordinary, merely wanting autonomy, the abolition of the monopoly system, and for Taiwanese people to be able to serve as administrative officials in Taiwan. Since Chiang Kai-shek claims to "return power to the people," what reason is there not to agree to the reasonable demands of the Taiwanese people, who are taking peaceful and legal procedures to achieve them? However, Chiang Kai-shek not only refused to agree but also used even more cruel methods than the Japanese fascists to suppress them. In the February 28th incident, at least three or four thousand Taiwanese compatriots were killed or injured, a degree of brutality unprecedented in history! Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "returning power to the people" and "democratic constitution" have once again completely exposed their purely deceptive nature. The armed self-defense of the Taiwanese people is therefore forced, necessary, just, and correct. The Taiwan autonomy movement will certainly not stop until its goals are achieved, and deception and suppression will only arouse greater anger among the Taiwanese compatriots.

The need for armed struggle solely to demand autonomy is not unique to Taiwan's experience; the experience of the Liberated Areas is the same. One of the goals of the CCP's struggle for more than twenty years is local autonomy. In these more than twenty years of struggle, we have accumulated ample experience in striving for autonomy to contribute to the people of the whole country and the Taiwan compatriots as a reference.

We want to tell the Taiwan compatriots: We fully sympathize with your efforts to strive for autonomy by peaceful means and your adoption of armed self-defense under Chiang Kai-shek's armed aggression. Your struggle is our struggle, your victory is our victory, and the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas will certainly support and help you with our own struggles.

We want to offer the following points of experience to the Taiwan compatriots so that the Taiwan autonomy movement can achieve its goal of victory.

First, since the armed struggle has begun, it is necessary to oppose compromise and oppose betrayal. Know that compromise and surrender to the fascist Chiang Kai-shek will subject the Taiwan compatriots to Chiang Kai-shek's most brutal bloodbath; any upper-level leaders who advocate compromise are betraying the Taiwan compatriots and should be resolutely purged and expelled; as long as you resolutely oppose compromise and betrayal and persevere, the Taiwan autonomy movement will surely achieve victory.

Second, the thirty-two-article program passed by the Handling Committee is good and should be resolutely fought for its realization. It is right to take over the Chiang government's property to be used for the expenses of the autonomy movement and to establish a democratic political affairs bureau as the preliminary stage of the autonomous organ. In addition to this, a military affairs bureau should be established immediately to organize the armed people into an armed force for Taiwan people's autonomy, to arm the broad masses of working people, and to direct these armed forces to fight for self-defense and to win autonomy. Since Chiang Kai-shek is determined to launch a greater armed offensive against the Taiwan compatriots, armed struggle has become an extremely important form of struggle, and the military affairs bureau should be established quickly, and a core regular autonomous army should be organized, and it should be in the hands of the most loyal, most determined, and most capable revolutionaries.

Third, we should immediately try to satisfy the economic demands of the laboring people. In the cities, distribute the houses of the Japanese and the property of the Chiang family to the workers and peasants, organize trade unions and workers' pickets, and organize urban poor people's groups and their armed forces; in the countryside, we must satisfy the economic demands of the peasants, such as rent reduction, interest reduction, land to the tiller, and organizing the peasants. Only by satisfying the demands of the laboring masses and organizing them will the autonomy movement truly have strength, and the autonomy program will be realized, which is the truly practical way to take care of the interests of all strata. If this is not done, and the mobilization of the laboring masses is hindered under the pretext of taking care of the interests of all strata, then the movement will have no strength and will be prone to failure, and therefore it will not be possible to take care of the interests of all strata, and in fact, it will be betraying the interests of all the Taiwan compatriots.

Fourth, in order for the autonomy movement to achieve victory, there must be a strong political organization to lead it. This organization can wage a strong and unyielding struggle against the enemies of the autonomy movement? Can identify and purge the internal traitors sent by the enemy into the autonomy movement. All parties, groups, and individuals in Taiwan participating in the autonomy movement should unite in the front that resolutely struggles for autonomy. All parties in this front should unite and help each other, and everyone should develop their own development so that this common front becomes a strong core in the autonomy movement. This front should be made public to guide the autonomy movement, so as to prevent the leading organs of the autonomy movement from being betrayed by wavering elements or usurped by reactionary traitors. We must always be vigilant that the betrayal within the autonomy movement is a more vicious enemy than the enemy outside.

Fifth, we must immediately train a large number of cadres and send them to various localities, to cities and villages, to lead armed forces, to lead political affairs, to lead mass movements, and to lead economic work. The more and the faster you train, the more universal the dispatch, the better. The cultural level of the Taiwanese people is relatively high, which is a convenient condition, and cadres can be trained from the laboring people from the very beginning.

Sixth, Chiang Kai-shek's policy toward the Taiwan autonomy movement is to suppress it violently; in the near future, the center of this movement will inevitably shift from large cities to small cities and villages. We must quickly send important leaders and a large number of cadres to places beyond the reach of the Chiang army to establish bases for the autonomy movement, send the received materials to these places, and distribute them appropriately, build a financial and economic foundation to support the autonomy movement for a long time, arm the people here, organize them, and resolutely take steps to satisfy the economic demands of the laboring people here. The big cities and their surroundings will inevitably become battlefields in the future when the Chiang army arrives, and the work there should focus on this.

The Chinese Liberated Areas have countless experiences to offer to the Taiwan compatriots, and the above points are the most important for the Taiwan compatriots at present. The Taiwan autonomy movement will undoubtedly go through many twists and turns, but it will surely triumph, and the time will not be long. Chiang Kai-shek is determined to use armed aggression to oppose the Taiwan autonomy movement, but his forces are already very depleted. The two divisions now being transferred to Taiwan were originally stationed in Taiwan and later transferred to participate in the civil war. The 20th Division was on the Xuzhou battlefield, where the Chiang army had been annihilated five full divisions (or armies) and sixteen full brigades (or divisions) since the end of December, and is acutely aware of the shortage of troops; the 21st Division has weak combat effectiveness, and its New 7th Brigade has been completely annihilated. The two divisions have a total of only 38,000 men. As long as the Taiwan compatriots take a resolute stand, these forces will have no way to suppress the autonomy movement burning throughout Taiwan. It is impossible for Chiang Kai-shek to send more troops to Taiwan. On the contrary, if there are autonomy movements and democratic movements in various places in the Chiang-controlled areas, and the Liberated Areas win a few more battles, Chiang Kai-shek's forces will feel even more inadequate, and the pressure on the Taiwan compatriots will be reduced. Therefore, the Taiwan compatriots' autonomy movement will surely triumph, and will soon triumph. The Chinese Communists warmly praise the heroic struggle of the Taiwan compatriots and wish the Taiwan compatriots a glorious victory! (March 19th)

### 台湾自治运动

    台湾自治运动
    台湾人民和平的自治运动，由于蒋介石政府的武装大屠杀，迫得起而自卫。到本月八日，已发展成为武装的斗争。台湾人民所组织的二、二八惨案处理委员会通过了《改革台省政治建议案》三十二条，并颁布命令于三月十五日以前成立政务局，其委员由台省各地人民普选产生。同时，又命令接受蒋政府在台湾以“公营”为名的四大家族独战企业。八日事变爆发后，蒋介石不但不悔悟，反而加紧其武装的进攻；开往台湾者有两个师，即第二十一师与第二十师。蒋介石并派了白崇禧、朱绍良等往台湾指挥。蒋介石的意图，显然想把台湾人民的自治运动淹没在血泊中。
    如果略为温习抗战胜利以后台湾发展的历史，就可以知道台湾的自治运动是完全合理的、合法的、和平的，它的所以变成武装斗争，完全是由蒋介石逼出来的。蒋介石对于台湾的统治，其野蛮程度，超过了日本帝国主义。台湾人民在蒋介石法西斯统治之下的生活，比当日本帝国主义的亡国奴还要痛苦。不少访问过台湾的中外记者，老早就指出了这一点。蒋孔宋陈四大家以劫收和专卖的方法，完全垄断了台湾的经济。这批中国封建法西斯对于台湾人民的掠夺如此残酷，简直连一线生机也不留给他们。最近由于蒋介石拚命打内战，在台湾征兵征粮，使台湾人民更加求生无路。台湾人民的要求，是极其平凡的，不过是要自治，要废止专卖制度，要台湾人能在台湾当行政官吏等而已。蒋介石既然说“还政于民”，台湾人民提出如此合理的要求，采取和平的合法的手续以求其实现，有何理由不答应他们？然而，蒋介石竟不但不答应，反以比日本法西斯更残忍的手段来加以镇压。二月二十八日的惨案中，台胞死伤者至少三四千人，其残暴程度真是旷古未有！蒋介石的所谓“还政于民”，所谓“民主宪法”，在这里又一次完全暴露了其纯粹欺骗的性质。台湾人民的武装自卫，因此乃是被迫的，是必要的，是正义的，是正确的。台湾人民的自治运动在其目的没有达到以前，是一定不会停止的，欺骗与镇压都只能激起台胞更大的愤怒而已。
    仅仅为了要求自治，就非武装斗争不可，这不仅台湾的经验如此，解放区的经验也是一样。中共二十余年的斗争，其目的之一，也就是地方自治。在这二十余年的斗争中，我们已经有很充分的争取自治的经验来贡献给全国人民和台湾同胞作为借鉴。
    我们要告诉台湾同胞：你们以和平方法争取自治，和在蒋介石武装进攻之下采取武装自卫的手段，我们对此是完全同情的。你们的斗争就是我们的斗争，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利，解放区军民必定以自己的奋斗来声援你们，帮助你们。
    我们要贡献给台湾同胞以下列几点经验，以便台胞的自治运动能达到胜利的目的。
    第一、武装斗争既已开始，必须反对妥协，反对出卖。须知对法西斯蒋介石的妥协投降，将使台湾同胞受到蒋介石最残暴的血洗；任何上层领袖如果主张妥协，那就是叛卖台胞，就应该坚决把它清洗出去，驱逐出去；只要坚决反对妥协，反对出卖，坚持下去，台湾的自治运动就一定会得到胜利。
    第二、处理委员会通过的三十二条纲领是好的，应当坚决为其实现而斗争。接收蒋政府财产供作自治运动的经费，和建立民主的政务局作为自治机关的初步，这些都是对的。除此以外，应该立即成立军务局，把武装的人民组成台湾人民自治的武装队伍，把广大的劳动人民武装起来，并指挥这些武装为自卫和争取自治而奋斗。由于蒋介石决心向台胞作更大的武装进攻，因而武装斗争成为极其重要的斗争形式，应当很快的把军务局成立起来，并组织基干的正规自治军，掌握在最忠心、最坚决、最有能力的革命者的手里。
    第三、应当立即设法满足劳苦人民的经济要求。在城市中把日本人的房屋和蒋家财产分配给工人、农民，组织工会和工人纠察队，组织城市贫民团体及其武装；在乡村要满足农民的经济要求，如减租减息、耕者有其田和把农民组织起来。满足劳苦大众的要求，并把他们组织起来，自治运动才真正有了力量，自治的纲领也才会实现，这就是真正切实的照顾了各阶层的利益。如果不这样做，以照顾各阶层利益为借口来阻碍劳苦大众的发动，则运动就没有力量，就会有失败的可能，因而就无法去照顾各阶层利益，实际上乃是叛卖了全体台胞的利益。
    第四、为了使自治运动取得胜利，必须有坚强的政治团体来做领导，这个团体对自治运动的敌人能坚强不屈的斗争？对于敌人派在自治运动中的内奸能够加以识别和肃清。参加自治运动的台湾各党派、各团体和个人，应当团结在为自治而坚决奋斗的阵线中，这个阵线中所有的党派，都应当互相团结，互相帮助，并且大家得到自己的发展，使这个共同的阵线成为自治运动中坚强的核心。这个阵线应该公开出来指导自治运动，以免自治运动的领导机关被动摇分子所出卖，或被反动派的内奸所篡夺。必须时时警惕自治运动内部的叛卖是比外面的敌人更凶恶的敌人。
    第五、必须立即训练大批的干部派到各地方去，派到城市和农村中去领导武装，领导政务工作，领导群众运动和领导经济工作，训练得愈多愈快愈好，派出得愈普遍愈好。台湾人民的文化程度是比较高的，这是一个便利的条件，可以一开始就从劳苦人民中多训练出干部来。
    第六、蒋介石对于台湾自治运动的方针是加以猛烈的镇压；在不久的将来，这个运动的中心由大城市转到小城市和乡村中去是不可免的。要迅速在蒋军鞭长莫及的地方，派出重要的领导人员和大批干部去建立自治运动的根据地，把接收的资材送到这些地方去的，并适当的分散开来，建设起长期支持自治运动财政经济基础，把这里的人民武装起来，组织起来，坚决的采取步骤满足这里劳苦人民的经济要求。大城市及其周围，将来蒋军来后，不可免的将成为战场，该处的工作应当以此为着眼点。
    中国解放区有无数经验可以供献给台湾同胞，上述的几点是当前对于台胞最重要的。台湾的自治运动无疑的还会经过许多曲折，但是它一定胜利，而且时间是不会很久的。蒋介石决心以武装进攻来反对台湾的自治运动，但是他的兵力已经非常枯竭。现在调往台湾的两个师，是原来驻在台湾而后来调去参加内战的，其二十师是在徐州战场，那里蒋军从十二月下旬以来，一连被歼五个整师（或军）十六个整旅（或师），正在痛感兵力不足；二十一师战斗力薄弱，其新七旅已被全部歼灭。两个师一共只有三万八千人，只要台胞采取坚决的立场，这些兵力决无办法镇压燃烧全台湾的自治运动。蒋介石再要加派兵力到台湾去是不可能的了，相反的，如果蒋管区各地都有自治运动和民主运动，解放区战场再打几个胜仗，蒋介石的兵力将更感不足，对于台胞的压力就会减轻。因此，台湾同胞的自治运动是一定胜利，而且不久就会胜利的。中国共产党人热烈赞扬台胞的英雄奋斗，而且预祝台胞的光荣胜利！（三月十九日）
