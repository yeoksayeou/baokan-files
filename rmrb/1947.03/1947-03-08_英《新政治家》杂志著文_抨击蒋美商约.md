　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. According to a Shanghai newspaper report on the 15th of last month, the British magazine "New Statesman" published an article denouncing the expansionist policy of American imperialism, in which it specifically mentioned the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty," saying that the treaty had been cited in the British Parliament as a blatant example of American imperialist crimes. The magazine pointed out: "Judging by the standards of the nineteenth century, this treaty is the same as the treaty that British capitalism launched a war in South Africa to force the Boers to sign. This treaty is exactly what China desperately wanted to abolish after the Western powers began to extend into China a hundred years ago." The magazine said: "We cannot find a better example of imperialism than the fact that a powerful country destroys the various defenses of an economically underdeveloped country, thereby gaining control of its national economic lifeline, as the price of supporting a corrupt and reactionary government engaged in civil war."

    抨击蒋美商约
    【新华社延安六日电】据上月十五日沪报载，英国《新政治家》杂志曾著文痛斥美帝国主义的扩张政策，其中特别谈到“中美商约”，说该商约曾在英国议会中被当做美帝国主义罪恶昭彰的例证提出。该杂志指出：“如以十九世纪的标准来衡量这个条约，就和英国资本主义在南非发动战争以武力强迫布尔人所订的条约一样。这个条约正是百年前西方势力开始伸入中国后中国所拚命要废除的。”该杂志说：“吾人找不到更好的帝国主义的例证比这个事实更有力，那就是一个强大的国家破坏了一个经济上尚未发展的国家各种防御，借此而获得对其全国经济命脉的控制，以为支持一个从事内战的腐化而反动的政府的代价。”
