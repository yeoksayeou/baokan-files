　　Eradicating Feudalism, The Movement Won't Stop
　　Wu'an Continues Review and General Liquidation
　　Boldly Mobilizing "Backward" Masses to Consolidate Emancipation Achievements
　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Comrade Wang Tingdong of the Wu'an County Party Committee reports: With the arrival of the spring plowing season, Wu'an's emancipated peasants have launched a land investigation and general liquidation movement to ensure planting according to wealth. According to statistics from 170 villages, peasants have already recovered over 12,000 mu of good land, over 7,000 rooms of houses, 400 head of livestock, 200,000 jin of grain, and other fruits totaling approximately 70 million yuan. The land investigation is combined with the struggle against "counter-attacks," recovering 18,000 old contract documents and uncovering 38 "sky-changing accounts" and 37 rifles and short guns from landlords. In investigating the land, the peasants are very meticulous, investigating ancestral halls, intermediaries, land plots, and documents. In terms of struggle methods, they employ a comprehensive approach of pouring out grievances and joint struggle, combined with comparing sufferings, times, positions, and strengths to conduct self-education. The peasants put forward slogans such as "Completely severing ties with landlords" and "Those who harbor and harm themselves, pull out the tail the landlord planted on us," universally digging out landlords' "air-raid shelters." In the struggle, the peasants are more united and awakened; Boyan and Luo Cheng donated 200 mu of land to Shuangyuquan Village, Nandashe donated 50 mu of land to Leyizhuang, and over 130 village cadres in the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Districts voluntarily gave up the excess land they had gained and exchanged it with the masses to level the playing field. Over 2,300 new activists have emerged in the in-depth movement. Another 350 outstanding peasants in the new districts have joined the Communist Party. The masses' disregard for land has gradually been overcome, and they have recognized the truth that having land is the only way to truly emancipate themselves. The county-wide cadre conference in early March summarized three main experiences of the in-depth movement:

　　I. From a historical perspective, due to a consistent underestimation of the reactionary and stubborn nature of feudal forces, each movement is followed by a sense of complacency. Guo, a local tyrant in Naoshang Village, wrote in his "sky-changing account": "Thousand-year-old paper documents will speak, and three generations of descendants will seek revenge." A landlord in Yuquanling borrowed 60 jin of wheat from the farmers' association, crying and weeping, to get through the New Year, but it was immediately discovered that he had 36 bags of grain stored at home. The deeper the movement goes, the more people realize that eradicating feudalism is not easy. The Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Districts mobilized all district cadres to inspect standard villages, and each district mostly adopted the approach of directly delving into backwardness, discovering problems, and breaking complacency. However, in a few villages, the cadres, with a purely task-oriented view, did not fully mobilize the backward masses and did not educate the masses about the cunning of landlords. They simply "swept the landlords out the door," which failed to unite 90% of the masses, and in fact, overlooked feudal remnants.

　　II. The county currently has one-quarter of its villages still backward; two-quarters of the villages still have about 30% or less of their population consisting of backward and semi-backward masses; and even in one-quarter of the advanced villages, there are still some backward elements. Therefore, the main task of the in-depth movement is still to mobilize all the backward masses and, through the mobilization of the backward, unite all the masses. Distinguishing between advanced and backward should be based on the movement and on class, and cannot be simply based on whether one can "delay work." In mobilizing the backward, some villages only saw hurting or neutralizing the middle peasants (which is correct), while neglecting the large number of poor and hired peasants who were left out, which is incorrect; broadly viewing backwardness without distinguishing its components is incorrect. Although the in-depth movement has emphasized mobilizing the backward, the hands-off approach of letting the backward masses seek their own liberation has not been clear enough. In many places, the task is simply entrusted to advanced masses, cadres, and activists to mobilize the backward, or they only circle around the backward masses, which causes five bad consequences: (1) Cadres and activists think: "You were mobilized by me," and actually still look down on the backward. (2) Some cadres and activists develop the idea of switching shifts, asking the backward to come up and work for a few days while they take a break. (3) The mobilization method of "squeezing out the backward" interrogates the backward masses: "Why are you backward? Why are you not active even after you have benefited? What are your thoughts?" The backward masses are afraid of being labeled backward, so their words and actions are inconsistent, acting actively in front of cadres but actually remaining backward. (4) In order to complete the task, some cadres offer some benefits to the backward masses as a gift, some simply pull them into the farmers' association, and some reluctantly ask them to pour out their grievances once, thinking that this counts as mobilizing them, so many backward masses seem "mobilized" for a while, but then become backward again. (5) Some cadres and activists do not allow new activists to take power and are unwilling to let the backward masses also become masters. Therefore, in mobilizing the backward, the main thing is to address their demands, let them pour out their grievances and reason, put down their burdens, and get rid of their mental illnesses (such as harboring landlords, etc.). Only when the backward masses awaken ideologically can a fierce movement of land investigation and general liquidation be formed, which actively consolidates the emancipated interests of the advanced masses. However, some villages simply investigate land without deeply mobilizing the backward, and some villages are still having cadres and activists "dig up internal goods," and the movement lacks momentum. In some villages, some households who have benefited too much affect the masses in leveling the playing field, which hinders the movement; in some villages, they simply pour out grievances and delineate classes, resulting in disorientation; in some villages, they break away from the movement and simply solve the problem of cadre-mass relations, causing the movement to be interrupted… Those who adopt this approach have all run into obstacles in the movement.

　　III. Regarding cadre-mass relations, attention should be paid to the fact that in some villages, feudal remnants have infiltrated the cadres, especially small cadres (such as the farmers' association in Xitushan Village, where nine group leaders are landlords), which must be clarified in the delineation of classes. Secondly, some village cadres are selfish and cliquish, seriously detached from the masses; in leadership, they sometimes simply emphasize not attacking cadres and accommodate backwardness. At other times, they simply replace cadres from top to bottom without considering the masses' awareness. Some places let cadres conduct rectification behind closed doors, not daring to make self-criticisms to the masses, thus damaging the enthusiasm of the masses. That is to say, if transforming cadres is simply regarded as a matter for the leadership, just individual talks, and the mass line method of loving the people and respecting cadres is not adopted, it is easy to create a situation where one dares not let go of democracy to adjust cadre-mass relations, and worries that cadre-mass relations will hinder the movement from moving forward.

　　In the future, the entire county will continue to face backwardness with the spirit of "not ending until it is thorough," promoting the upsurge of land investigation and general liquidation. And implement filling in the gaps and making up for deficiencies, earnestly eliminating extreme poverty, and on this basis, carry out a county-wide conscious solidarity movement.

### 封建不消灭运动不停止  武安继续复查总清算  放手发动“落后”群众才能巩固翻身成果

　　封建不消灭运动不停止
    武安继续复查总清算
    放手发动“落后”群众才能巩固翻身成果
    【本报特讯】武安县委王庭栋同志报导：春耕到来，武安翻身农民为了按富根，又掀起了查田总清算运动。据一百七十个村的统计：农民已经查回好地一万二千余亩，房子七千余间，牲口四百头，粮食廿万斤，其他果实合计约七千余万元。查田中结合着反“反攻”的斗争，要回老约文书一万八千账，查出地主的变天账卅八本，长短枪卅七支。在查土地上，农民作的很细致，查堂号、查中人，对地块、对文书。在斗争方法上发挥一揽子诉苦与联合斗争，又结合比痛苦、比时光、比地位、比力量进行自我教育。农民提出：“和地主彻底分家”“包庇害自己，拔掉地主给咱按上的尾巴”的口号，普遍挖了地主“防空洞”。斗争中农民更加团结与觉悟；伯延、罗承赠给双玉泉村二百亩地，南大社赠给乐意庄五十亩地，四、六、八区一百卅多个村干部自动让出多得土地与群众换平。深入运动中涌现出二千三百余新积极分子。新区又有三百五十个优秀农民加入共产党。群众轻视土地的思想逐渐克服，认识了有土地才能真翻身的道理。三月初的全县干部大会总结了深入运动三个主要经验：
    一、从历史上看，由于一向对封建势力的反动顽强性估计不足，因此每段运动后，产生一次自满情绪就成为规律。瑙上村姓郭的恶霸在变天账上写着：“千年纸文会说话，三代子孙要报仇。”玉泉岭一个地主哭哭啼啼向农会借了六十斤麦子过年，但随即发现他家存有三十六布袋粮食。运动越深入越认识消灭封建不容易。二、三、四、八区发动全区干部检查标准村，各区大都采取直接深入落后，发现问题，打破自满的作法。但也有少数村庄的干部，单纯任务观点，不去充分发动落后群众，不以地主狡猾教育群众，就简单把地主“扫地出门”，这就作不到团结百分之九十的群众，实际上也就遗漏了封建残余。
    二、全县目前尚有四分之一的落后村；有四分之二的村庄，尚有占人口约十分之三以下的落后与半落后群众；有四分之一的先进村中，也还有一部分落后分子，因此深入运动的主要任务，依然是发动全部落后群众与经过落后的发动，团结全体群众。划分先进落后，要从运动中看，从阶级上看，不能单纯以能否“误工”来划分。有的村在发动落后中，只看到刺伤与中立的中农（这是对的），而忽视了遗漏的大批贫雇农是不对的，笼统看落后，不分成份是不对的。深入运动以来虽强调发动落后，但让落后群众自求解放的放手路线不够明确，不少地方是单纯委之于先进群众干部积极分子去发动落后，或是只在落后群众中打圈子，这就造成五条坏处：（一）干部积极分子认为：“你是我发动起来的”，实际上仍轻视落后。（二）有的干部积极分子产生换班思想，叫落后的起来干几天，自己歇一歇。（三）“挤落后”的发动方法，追问落后群众：“你为什么落后？你为什么得了利还不积极？你是什么思想？”落后群众怕当落后，就言行不一致，对着干部积极，实际上仍落后。（四）干部为了完成任务，有的是恩赐给落后群众一些果实，有的是简单拉入农会，有的是勉强叫诉一次苦，他们认为这就算发动起来了，因此有不少落后群众，一时像“发动起来”，过后就又落后了。（五）有的干部积极分子不让新积极分子当权，不愿让落后群众也起来作主人。因此在发动落后中主要是应依据他们的要求，让他们诉苦说理，放下包袱，去了心病（如包庇地主等）。只有当落后群众从思想上觉悟起来，才能形成查田总清算的猛烈运动，这一运动又积极的巩固了先进群众的翻身利益。但是有的村是单纯查田，不深入发动落后，有的村还是干部积极分子“挖内货”，运动劲头不大。有的村是一部分得利过多户影响群众填平，使运动阻滞；有的村是单纯诉苦划阶级，结果迷失方向；有的村是脱离运动单纯解决干民关系问题，使运动中断；…………采取这种作法的，都在运动中碰了壁。
    三、在干群关系上，应注意有些村封建残余分子混入干部，特别是小干部（如西土山村农会有九个小组长是地主）必须在划阶级中澄清，其次有些村干部自私宗派，严重脱离群众；领导上有时单纯强调不打击干部，而迁就落后。有时又不根据群众觉悟，自上而下简单撤换干部。有的地方让干部关门整风，不敢向群众作自我批评，因而损伤了群众热情。这就是说，如果把改造干部单纯看作是领导上的事，只是个别谈话，而不采取爱民尊干的群众路线方法，就易造成既不敢放手民主的调整干民关系，又发愁干民关系阻碍运动不能前进。
    今后全县仍以“不搞彻底不结束”的精神，面向落后，推动查田总清算的热潮。并贯彻填平补齐，认真消灭赤贫农，在这一基础上，开展一个全县规模的自觉团结运动。
