In the land reform, guerrilla warfare has become more active.
Taiyue border region is fighting and distributing land everywhere.
[Report from Taiyue, 1st of this month] Since the beginning of spring, land reform has generally started in various border areas, and guerrilla warfare has become more active as a result, with fighting and land distribution taking place everywhere. It started in Lingshi, and then spread to Huo County, Jiexiu, Pingyao, Zhaocheng and other places. In ×× village in Pingyao, the Yan army's attacks of more than 400 people were crushed three times in three days on the 10th, 12th, and 16th, and twelve Yan soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. The spider web joint defense in Fushan implemented "those who fight, fight; those who distribute land, distribute land." From February 2nd to March 13th, the Home Guard repelled eighteen large and small attacks by the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army, killing, wounding, and capturing twenty-three enemies, enabling land reform to be carried out safely in Nanwang Village and other places. The militia in Yicheng, Shangling, and Linfen have launched a new campaign to make meritorious contributions to support the land reform. The fifth district of Yicheng took the lead in launching a psychological offensive, going deep into the Chiang-occupied areas to publicize current events and land reform, thus winning over twelve puppet-organized village team leaders and twenty puppet family members, causing the Chiang puppet regime to disintegrate. The Xiangling militia promoted the heroic fighting style in the grid network and cooperated with the land reform. In the month and a half from January to February, they wiped out forty-nine Chiang Kai-shek's puppet soldiers. In the previous period, Yuanqu neglected land reform. Now, it has begun to organize powerful armed forces, close to the border areas, to protect land reform. After the Lianfang Village of Yuanshangzhen Village recaptured the cattle, sheep, and other things looted by the counter-settlement team in the counter-settlement struggle last month, it carried out land reform on the basis of the counter-settlement struggle. The district cadres of the First District also went deep into the area around the city on the 26th of last month to fight against the counter-settlement team. They killed three members of the counter-settlement team in Xie Village near the city. Northern Henan, Jiyuan, and Meng County continue to carry out land reform, especially Jiyuan, which has penetrated into 45 small mountain villages such as Nihegou and Hongtugou. The local militia built a landmine defense line for land distribution there to prevent the Chiang puppet army from attacking, so that they could distribute land with peace of mind.
