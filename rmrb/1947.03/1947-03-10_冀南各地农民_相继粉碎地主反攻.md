Farmers in Southern Hebei
    Successively Smash Landlord Counterattacks
    [Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 8th] Farmers in various parts of Southern Hebei have successively thwarted landlord sabotage and counter-offensive conspiracies. Li Qingshou, a local tyrant landlord from Houtasikou, Julu, became a special agent in Shimen after being liquidated by the masses. The masses found an account book in the gap of his wall, which meticulously recorded the grain and money he had given out since the increase in wages, rent reduction, and interest reduction, as well as who got how much. The masses clearly saw through his scheme: "He still wants to settle accounts in reverse in the future, intending to kill the poor." Su Litang, a large landlord from Houxiazhuang, Wucheng, was cunning and was nicknamed "Yellow Eyeballs." After being liquidated, he compensated the masses with the trees in his woods. When distributing the fruits, the masses wrote the price and number on the trees so that they could be distributed according to the numbers. "Yellow Eyeballs" secretly changed the numbers on the trees when no one was watching, changing two thousand to one thousand, intending to make it impossible for the farmers' association to settle the accounts and cause "internal strife." Wang Xichen, a landlord from Nanren Village, Yuanchao, launched a counter-offensive against the masses by spreading superstitious rumors. Qi Mengchen, a feudal landlord from Doutun, Wuyi, bought off three backward people and incited them to attack the director of the farmers' association. His personally written offensive plan was obtained by the militia squad leader, and the truth came to light, which greatly educated the masses. In addition, Wuyi also discovered new tricks for the landlord's counter-offensive: such as inciting military dependents to disagree with various departments in the village, colluding with households who had been struggled against to file complaints with county and district cadres, saying that they had struggled against middle peasants and wanted to return the fruits, etc.

　　冀南各地农民
    相继粉碎地主反攻
    【本报冀南八日电】冀南各地相继粉碎地主破坏反攻阴谋。钜鹿后塔寺口恶霸地主李庆寿，被清算后跑到石门当了特务，群众从他家墙隙中弄出一本账，自增资、减租、减息，彻底清算以来他拿出的粮款以及谁得了多少都记的非常详细，群众很清楚的识破“他还想将来倒算，打算把穷人整死”。武城后夏庄大地主苏立堂，鬼计多端，外号“黄眼珠子”，被清算后，把树林赔给群众。分果实时群众在树上写上价钱、号码，以便按数分配，“黄眼珠子”趁人不见，偷把树上的数字改了，原是两千改成一千，打算叫农会算不清账，闹“内哄”。元朝南人村地主王希臣，以散布迷信谣言向群众反攻。武邑窦屯封建地主齐梦臣，收买了三个落后群众，挑拨攻击农会主任，他亲写的进攻计划书被民兵班长获得，于是真相大白，给群众很大教育。此外，武邑还发觉地主反攻的新花样：如挑拨军属与村中各部门闹意见，勾通被斗争户向县区干部告状，说斗了中农，要退还果实等。
