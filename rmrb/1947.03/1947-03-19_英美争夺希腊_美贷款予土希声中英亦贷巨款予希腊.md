Anglo-American Struggle for Greece
　　While the US Loans Money to Turkey and Greece, Britain Also Loans a Huge Sum to Greece
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th】London dispatch: Amidst the US decision to loan Turkey and Greece $400 million, the British House of Commons, after heated debate, passed a £19 million loan to Greece on the 14th. The vast majority of this, £18 million, is to be used as military expenditure for the Greek reactionary government's civil war from January to March 31st of this year, with only £1 million reportedly for "the needs of civilian goods."
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th】Washington dispatch: The specific steps by which the US is controlling Greece have become even more apparent due to the remarks of Willard, Deputy Director of the Near East and Africa Division of the State Department. Willard declared on the National Broadcasting Company on the evening of the 15th: the US will send engineers, public health experts, tax and agricultural experts to Greece, with the aim of helping them build railways and highways, and formulate and implement foreign exchange work, trade controls and financial work. US experts will also study the current Greek financial system, and may "draft new laws and supervisory bodies."
