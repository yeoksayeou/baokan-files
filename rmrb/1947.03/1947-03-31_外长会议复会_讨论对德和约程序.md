    Foreign Ministers' Meeting Resumes
    Discussing Procedures for German Peace Treaty
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th] Moscow Dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Conference, after a two-day recess, resumed at 16:00 on the 25th, chaired by Molotov, to discuss the report of the Foreign Ministers' Assistants on the procedures for preparing the German peace treaty and the issue of reparations. When discussing the procedures for the German peace treaty, Molotov strongly advocated for Albania to be one of the eighteen Allied nations participating in the formulation of the treaty. He responded to Marshall's accusations against Albania by stating that Albania had contributed significant strength in the war against Germany. Bevin suggested that Iran should be invited to participate, and Molotov agreed. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had previously notified the Italian government, agreeing that Italy had the right to express its opinions on the drafting of the German peace treaty. When discussing the convening of the German peace conference, both Marshall and Bevin advocated that China should be among the countries invited to the conference. The Soviet Union's attitude is not yet known. Marshall also presented a three-stage plan for the German peace treaty at the meeting, advocating that all participating countries, large and small, should be invited to the conference. Marshall also argued that "the German people, not any German officials, should accept the treaty." Molotov refuted this, stating that the Soviet delegation insisted that the German peace treaty should be signed by the German government. When discussing the issue of reparations, Marshall argued that the United States had so far received only 275 million US dollars in reparations from Germany and denied receiving any gold. On the 25th, the Liaison Committee, the Foreign Ministers' Assistants' meeting on Austria, and various specialized subcommittees also held separate meetings.
    [Report from this newspaper] TASS, Moscow, 28th: The Foreign Ministers' Conference, chaired by Bevin today, continued to discuss proposals related to German assets. After exchanging views on reviewing the procedures of the Liaison Committee's report, the conference re-examined the issue of the organization of the peace conference.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th] Moscow Dispatch: On the 25th, Molotov, Bevin, Marshall, and Bidault all attended a performance of "Romeo and Juliet" at the Soviet Grand Opera House. Other guests included French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. and Mrs. Jodru, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. and Mrs. Peterson, and Generals Clark, Clay, Robertson, and Koning. From the Soviet side, Mr. and Mrs. Vyshinsky, Mr. and Mrs. Gusev, and Sokolovsky, among others, attended. Heads of various countries' embassies in Moscow and journalists from various countries were also present. The seats were decorated with the flags of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France. The crowd enthusiastically cheered the four foreign ministers.
