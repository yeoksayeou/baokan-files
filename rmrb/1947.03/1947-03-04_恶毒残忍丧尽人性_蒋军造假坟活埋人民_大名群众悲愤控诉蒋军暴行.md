Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 1st: The day after Daming was recovered, a reporter, drawn by sounds of miserable weeping, walked to a grave pit on a hill outside the city. The twenty-odd corpses displayed around the pit were surrounded by dense crowds. The deceased were village cadres and militiamen from villages near the city. After Chiang's troops occupied Daming, they were captured and "trained" in the city, and their relatives have now found them in several grave pits. The corpses were bloody and mangled, with their arms tightly bound behind their backs. One had his purplish belly, burnt by fire, exposed, while another had only his nose and lower jaw left, his eyes having been gouged out. A female corpse had her arms bound behind her back, her short hair frozen together with blood and soil, her facial features blurred. It is said that she was Director Jiang of the Women's Rescue Association in front of Daming City. After she was arrested, neighbors heard her resisting and scolding, praising her for "dying cleanly and with backbone!" At this moment, a five- or six-year-old child came looking for the corpses of relatives, and suddenly threw himself on a corpse and cried out, "That's him!" The reporter couldn't bear to look any longer and turned to go to another place, but was stopped by four old ladies on the way. They cried, "You must avenge us!" They said that before these grave pits were dug open, there were many wooden plaques in front of the graves with words such as "Grave of So-and-so, Soldier of the Thirty-second Division of Chiang's Army." On a large grave, the masses discovered that the feet of a corpse were wearing shoes of ordinary people. Digging it open, they saw dozens of bloody corpses inside, all wearing clothes familiar to the villagers. They couldn't help but exclaim in unison with hatred: "The grave is fake! The people buried inside are all our own people!" (Lin Li)
[Our newspaper, Ji'nan, Weixian, 1st:] Mass accusations against the atrocities of Chiang's troops have unfolded in the urban and rural areas of Daming. Especially in the hardest hit urban areas, one can hear the sorrowful and indignant complaints at any time, whether in the streets or alleys. When the reporter arrived at the Lizheng vehicle shop in South Street, he had just stopped his car when he heard the owner of the shop, Shen (a Christian), say, "The Chiang bandits forced the shopkeepers to repair the city and build fortifications on the one hand, and forced them to open for business on the other. A cart belt worth 10,000 yuan was given at most a few hundred yuan in Chiang coins." What saddened him most was when he loaded a cart for a certain adjutant of the 141st Brigade. He calculated the price at the lowest at 40,000 yuan in legal tender, but the adjutant glared at him and said, "Ask someone to go to the brigade headquarters with me to get the money!" Shopkeeper Shen saw that the situation was not good, so he had to suffer a loss and ask for less. All the stock in the shoe shop next door to Shopkeeper Shen was looted. A peddler from Fengbaikou, Weixian County, who came to the city for the market, was detained by Chiang's troops for a month. He said that there were twenty-six people imprisoned with him, and twenty-five were buried before he left. He escaped while being escorted by Chiang's troops. An eighty-year-old woman in County Front Street, leaning on a shaky crutch, trembled all over and wept. All the young people in her family were taken away, and all the bedding, money, and food were looted. She was trampled by Chiang's army's warhorses while Chiang's army was robbing things. She cried and showed everyone her trampled thigh. The facts give the people of Daming a painful lesson: that is, they must not have any more illusions about Chiang's army, and only by defeating Chiang Kai-shek can they have peaceful days.

　　恶毒残忍丧尽人性
    蒋军造假坟活埋人民
    大名群众悲愤控诉蒋军暴行
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫一日电】大名收复后之次日，记者为凄惨之哭号声所招引，走到城郊岗上的一座坟坑旁边，坟坑周围陈列着的二十多具尸体，为密层层的人群所围拢。死者系城附近各村村干部及民兵。蒋军侵占大名后，被抓到城里“受训”，现在始被他们的亲属在几座坟坑中觅获。尸体血肉模糊，两臂被紧紧反绑。其中一个坦露着被火烧的青紫的肚皮，另一个仅剩了鼻子和下颚，眼睛也被挖去。一个女尸两臂被反绑，短发已和血土凝冻在一起，五官模糊不清，据说是大名城前妇救会蒋主任。她被捕后，邻居们曾听到反抗的叫骂声，都称赞她“死得干净，死得有骨气！”这时一个五六岁的小孩来找寻亲属尸体，最后突然扑到一个尸体上失声大哭着：“这就是他！”记者真不忍心再看下去，转身想到另一地方去，中途又为四个老太太拉住。他们哭诉：“你们可得替俺报仇！”他们说：这些坟坑未挖开以前，墓前插有不少写着蒋军“三十二师士兵某某之墓”等字的木牌，这类坟墓在城外是很多的。在一个大坟上，群众发觉有一尸体的脚穿着老百姓的鞋子，掘开看见里面几十具血肉模糊的尸体，都穿着大家熟悉的老乡衣服。他们不禁齐声仇恨的惊叫起来：“坟是假的呀！里面埋的都是咱自己人呀！”（林里）
    【本报冀南威县一日电】群众性的控诉蒋军暴行，已在大名城乡展开。特别是受灾最深的市区，不论街头巷尾，悲愤激昂的诉苦，随时可闻。记者行至南街立正车子铺前，刚站稳脚步，便听到该店主人申某（系一基督教徒）说：“蒋贼一面逼着伙计俩修城筑堡，一面又强令开张营业。值一万元的车子带，最多给几百元蒋币。”使他最伤心的是给一四一旅某副官装车子，他以最低价格算了四万元法币，副官把眼一瞪说：“你叫人跟我到旅部去拿钱吧！”申掌柜看风不对，只好吃亏少要。申掌柜的隔壁鞋庄，所有存货悉数被抢。一位进城赶集的小贩，魏县冯白渴人，被蒋军扣了一个月。他说：和他囚禁在一处的共二十六人，临走时埋了二十五个。他于送蒋军的中途逃脱。县前街一位八十岁的老婆，扶着动摇不定的拐杖，混身颤抖，泣不成声。她家的年青人统被抓走，所有的被服、钱粮也统被抢光。她在蒋军抢东西时，为蒋军战马踏伤。他哭诉着露出被踏伤的大腿让大家看。事实给大名人民一个惨痛的教训，这就是不能对蒋军再有任何一点幻想，只有打败蒋介石才能有太平日子过。
