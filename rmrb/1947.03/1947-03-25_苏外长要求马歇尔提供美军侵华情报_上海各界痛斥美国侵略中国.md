Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: New York dispatch: The New York Times published a Moscow dispatch on the 20th, stating that "Marshall has made a special request to Washington regarding the implementation of the agreement on China." The dispatch also stated: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, regarding the situation in China, has requested Marshall to provide intelligence, including the current number of US troops in China and their final withdrawal plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd: Belated Shanghai news: On the eve of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, people from all walks of life in Shanghai wrote articles calling for opposition to US imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs and its crimes of assisting Chiang in the civil war. Mr. Deng Chumin believes: "The reason why the China problem has not been resolved is due to the Kuomintang's autocratic destruction of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and the US imperialist aggression and dispatch of troops to garrison China's important sea and air fortresses, threatening world peace." Deng called for the realization of a truly "most thorough and complete democratic government." Ms. Xu Guangping stated: "The Chinese people's hope for the Moscow Conference is not to demand international intervention, but to correct the United States' erroneous policies." She pointed out: "The Kuomintang's shouting of 'opposing foreign interference' is actually fearing the Moscow Conference's discussion of the China issue, and preventing US imperialism from supporting a one-party government." She pointed out that the solution to the China problem "mainly relies on the entire Chinese people to exert their strength to expand and consolidate the patriotic democratic united front, and to be discussed by the Moscow Conference and handled in accordance with the requirements of the entire Chinese people." Zhang Bo called on national democratic groups to unite and protest against US imperialism's violation of the decision of the Moscow Conference not to interfere in China's internal affairs. Renowned journalist Huan Xiang pointed out: "The Kuomintang authorities did not say a word of opposition during the year that the United States interfered in internal affairs; but today they shamelessly shout 'oppose international interference'. Their conspiracy is very clear, to add a label of 'no concept of the motherland' to all those who are striving for the independence of the motherland. In fact, they themselves are the ones who are selling out China." Shi Fuliang stated: "As long as there is no foreign force to join in the China problem, the Chinese people will definitely be able to solve their own problems with their own strength." Liu Yazi, Ai Hansong and others all advocated that the United States should completely change its policy towards China and completely withdraw its troops stationed in China in order to eradicate the Chinese civil war.

    苏外长要求马歇尔提供美军侵华情报
    上海各界痛斥美国侵略中国
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】纽约讯：纽约时报于二十日刊载莫斯科通讯称：“马歇尔已向华府就对华协定实施事件特别请示”。该通讯又称：苏外长莫洛托夫关于中国情势，已向马歇尔提出供给情报的要求，其中包括美军目前在华数目及其最后撤退计划等项。
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】迟到的上海消息：莫斯科四国外长会议前夕，上海各界人士著文呼吁反对美国帝国主义干涉中国内政及助蒋内战罪行。邓初民氏认为：“中国问题所以没有解决的原因，是由于国民党专横破坏政协决议，及美帝国侵略及派遣军队驻札中国海空要塞，威胁世界和平。”邓氏要求实现一个真正的“最彻底最完全的民主政府”。许广平氏称：“中国人民寄予莫斯科会议的希望，并不是要求国际干涉，而是要纠正美国的错误政策。”指出：“国民党叫喊着的‘反对外力干涉’，实际上是畏惧莫斯科会议对中国问题，阻止美帝国主义支持一党政府之故。”指出中国问题解决途径“主要是靠中国人民全体拿出力量来扩大巩固爱国民主阵线，并由莫斯科会议提出讨论，加以符合于全中国人民要求之处理。”张＠伯氏呼吁全国民主团体联合起来，抗议美帝国主义违背莫斯科会议中，不干涉中国内政的决定。名记者宦乡氏指出：“国民党当局在美国干涉了一年内政的期间，不曾说过一句反对的话；而今天居然厚着脸皮高喊‘反对国际干涉’，他们的阴谋是很明白的，是要把一切争取祖国独立的人们再加上一项‘无祖国观念’的帽子。其实，出卖中国的就是他们自己。”施复亮氏表示：“中国问题只要没有外国势力来加入，中国人民一定能够用自己的力量解决自己的事。”柳亚子、艾寒松等氏均主张美国应彻底改变对华政策，完全撤退驻华军队，以根绝中国内战。
