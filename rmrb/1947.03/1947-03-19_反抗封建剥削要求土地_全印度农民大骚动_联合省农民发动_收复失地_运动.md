　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: New Delhi dispatch: The Indian countryside is currently a land of widespread unrest, filled with what are misrepresented as "religious disputes" or "Hindu-Muslim conflicts," but the vast majority are actually about land issues. There are at least six or seven major conflicts burning. These struggles, when they occur, immediately escalate into armed clashes. In Bengal Province, there is the "Two-Thirds Movement" by tenant farmers. Tenant farmers account for 41% of all farmers in the province, and they actually have to hand over "two-thirds" of their harvest to the "sub-landlords." Rent arrears are repaid threefold. The "sub-landlords" are also usurers. When tenant farmers borrow money to pay for grain, they have to repay three times the amount borrowed. When they borrow grain to repay in money, the annual interest rate is twelvefold. Since October of last year, in 11 out of the 28 counties in Bengal Province, the "Two-Thirds" movement has occurred, demanding that landlords can only take one-third of the harvest as rent, and they are implementing automatic rent division. In the United Provinces, there are 36 million acres of cultivated land, of which 30 million acres are in the hands of 6,000 large landlords. The province has a total population of 55 million, of which 10 million are landless laborers. The peasant struggle in the United Provinces is mainly an "anti-eviction" and "land reclamation" movement. In areas where peasant associations are well-organized, some of this land has already been reclaimed. In addition, Punjab Province has a rent resistance struggle, Bihar Province has a "land reclamation" struggle and a struggle to win back unity with India, and the princely states have anti-slavery and anti-tyranny struggles, as well as a "half-share rent" movement, etc.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Since the end of last month, the disturbances in Bihar Province and Punjab Province have intensified, especially the disturbances in Lahore and other cities that began on the 3rd of this month. The disturbances in Bihar Province have the nature of a land struggle by peasants resisting the feudal exploitation of landlords. In the face of this peasant movement, the upper-level leaders of the National Congress Party and the Muslim League in the two provinces are trying to compromise. The Congress Party has already handed over the government positions of Punjab Province to the Muslim League, and the chairman of the Muslim League in that province has also called for "restoring order." The Executive Committee of the National Congress Party has resolved on the 8th to accept the British policy statement on India. Before this meeting, the National Congress Party had already split internally. The Congress Socialist Party convened its fifth congress on the 2nd, resolving to demand that Britain immediately transfer power to the Indian people and that British troops immediately withdraw. It was also decided that the party would be renamed the Socialist Party, abolish the title of National Congress, and abolish the red flag as the party flag to distinguish it from the Communist Party.

　　反抗封建剥削要求土地
    全印度农民大骚动
    联合省农民发动“收复失地”运动
    【新华社延安十五日电】新德里讯：目前印度农村可算是遍地烽火，到处关着被人讹传为“宗教纠纷”的“印回之斗”，其实绝大部分是为了土地问题，现在至少有六七处大火头在燃烧着，这些斗争不发生则已，一发生便是武装冲突。在孟加拉省有佃农的“三分之二运动”，该省佃农占全体农民的百分之四十一，他们的收获实际上要缴“三分之二”给“二地主”，欠租要按三倍偿还，“二地主”又是高利贷者，佃农借钱还粮时要借一还三，借粮还钱时年利十二倍。从去年十月起，孟加拉全省二十八县中，有十一县发生“三分之二”运动，要求地主只能拿三分之一收获量作为地租，他们并实行自动分租。在联合省耕地共有三千六百万英亩，其中三千万英亩在六千个大地主手中，全省人口共有五千五百万人，其中一千万人是无地的雇工。联合省的农民斗争主要是“反退佃”和“收复失地”运动，在农会组织健全的地方，这种失地已有一部分收复了。除此之外，旁遮普省有灭租斗争，比哈尔省有“收复失地”斗争及争取回印团结的斗争，土邦里面有反奴役反暴政斗争，及“对半分地租”运动等。
    【新华社延安十五日电】自上月下旬起，比哈尔省及旁遮晋省之骚动又形成重压尤以本月三日开始的拉合尔等城之骚动为甚，该哈尔省之骚动带有农民反抗地主封建剥削之土地斗争的性质，在此农民运动面前，两省国民大会党与回教同盟之上层领袖力谋妥协，国大党已将旁遮普省政府职位与回盟，而该省回盟主席亦号召“恢复秩序”。国大党执委会已于八日决议接受英对印度政策声明，在此次会议之前，国大党内部已形分裂，国大社会党于二日召开该党第五届大会，决议要求英国立即将政权移交印人，英军立即撤退，并决定该党改称社会党，取消国大之称号，同时又废除以红旗为党旗以别于共产党。
