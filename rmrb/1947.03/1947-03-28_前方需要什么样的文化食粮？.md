    What Kind of Cultural Nourishment Does the Front Need?
    Guo Jingren
    The general cadres of a certain column are very interested in the special collection of the Current Affairs Digest. Many materials in the special collection are the speeches of democratic figures in the KMT-controlled areas. They scold the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek righteously. They describe many things that we cannot see or hear in our base areas. The articles they write are in various forms such as essays, communications, poems, ballads, short commentaries, etc., which are lacking in our liberated area's literary world. Therefore, they suit the tastes of the cadres and greatly increase their confidence in victory. Regarding novels, "Fear and Fearlessness" is the most popular among cadres, followed by "The People Are Immortal." Regarding "Fear and Fearlessness," the column party committee made a decision calling on cadres to read it. I remember when we went to the Second and Third Troops to help with work, Commander Lei emphasized the importance of studying this document at a cadre meeting, and the regimental party committees also issued this decision. Comrade Li Ke, deputy political commissar of the first battalion of the Sixth and Seventh Troops, after reading it, went to the platoon-level and above cadres to read it collectively. Comrade Wang Desheng, battalion commander of the Third Battalion, said to me: "I have read it once, and I want to read it two more times."... Due to the demands of many cadres in the troops, and in order to make the content and significance of this book clear to the general soldiers, some comrades in the Pingyuan Theatre Troupe are now trying to adapt "Fear and Fearlessness" into a play for performance.
    Why is "Fear and Fearlessness" so popular in the troops? There are two main reasons: 1. The troops are strictly enforcing discipline, and the content of this book in this regard is of great educational significance to our troops. 2. The Red Army troops written in the book are a new force, and after thirteen months, they became the main force. This is somewhat similar to the current situation of our troops. There are many new components in our troops, and the cadres are worried: "How can we lead the new soldiers in battle?" After reading this book, their confidence in this regard has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, I suggest continuing to reprint such novels and provide the troops with more cultural nourishment that is helpful for work and combat.

    前方需要什么样的文化食粮？
    郭竞仁
    某纵队一般干部对时事文摘的文特辑很感兴趣，时又特辑中许多材料大部份是蒋管区民主人士的言论，他们骂国民党蒋介石骂得理直气壮，他们叙述了我们根据地很多看不到听不到的事情。他们写的文章是各种形式的论文、通讯、诗歌、打油诗、短评等，而这些却是我们解放区文坛上所缺乏的，所以适合干部口味，又大大提高其胜利信心。关于小说以《恐惧与无畏》最受干部欢迎，《人民是不朽的》次之。关于《恐惧与无畏》，纵队党委曾作了决定，号召干部必读。记得我们去二三部队帮助工作的时候，雷首长在干部会上强调提出学习这本文件，各团党委也都下达了这个决定。六七部队一营副政委李克同志读了之后，再去排以上干部中去集体读。三营营长王得胜同志对我说：“我已读了一遍，还要看两遍。”…………由于部队中许多干部的要求，并使一般战士都能明了这本书的内容与意义，平原剧团有的同志现正想试验把《恐惧与无畏》编成剧本演出。
    为什么《恐惧与无畏》这样在部队中受到欢迎呢？有两个最主要的原因：一、部队正在严整纪律，这本书中在这方面的内容对我们部队有很大的教育意义。二、书中所写的红军部队，是一个新部队，十三个月之后竟变成主力，这一点与我们部队的现状有些相同，我们部队的新成份很多，干部发愁的是：“打起仗来新兵怎么往上带呢？”读了这本书后，大大增强了他们在这方面的信心。因此我建议继续多翻印这样的小说，给部队更多的供给对于工作战斗有帮助的文化食粮。
