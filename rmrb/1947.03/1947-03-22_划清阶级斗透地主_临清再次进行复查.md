    Clearly Delineate Class, Thoroughly Struggle Against Landlords:
    Linqing Conducts Further Review

    [Report from our Jinnan Office, 20th] After the anti-traitor and grievance-airing campaign, Linqing's Third District has already conducted reviews, but serious problems still exist in many villages. In Liu Xizi Village, it was discovered that landlords and rich peasants had concealed over 3 *qing* of land, more than ten impoverished households had not been eliminated, six landlord and rich peasant households falsely claimed only a little over 2 *qing* of local land, and many households who had been struggled against in other villages were selling land entrusted to others in this village. In Daxinzhuang, fourteen impoverished households had less than 1.5 *mu* of land per person on average. In X Village, over 70 *mu* of land entrusted to landlords was discovered. In the Fourth Sub-district, over 3 *qing* of land mortgaged or entrusted to landlords was discovered in more than ten villages. Da Chizhuang conducted a new round of reckoning, recovering over 8-9 million *yuan* in hidden wealth, averaging over 30,000 *yuan* per household. After the Sixth District conducted rent reduction investigations, it has recently been discovered that many villages have landlords with omissions and incomplete reckonings. The reasons are: 1. District and village cadres have unclear class delineations. Many households were landlords before the mass movement, but were assessed as middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants. Zhang Chunsheng of Xiaoliuzhuang, before the mass movement, had only five family members and 90 *mu* of fertile land, entirely relying on hired labor for cultivation. In order to evade struggle, he dispersed and concealed the land two years ago, but still lived a comfortable life. When analyzing his class status, he was actually assessed as a well-to-do middle peasant. 2. Eliminating landlords was decided solely based on the amount of land retained. The property of most landlords was untouched. For example, four landlord households in Lu Village retained over a hundred brick houses. 3. Individual village cadres and activists shielded landlords, and the masses were willing to struggle but dared not. Based on the above three situations, forces are now being reorganized to conduct a further review.

    划清阶级斗透地主
    临清再次进行复查
    【本报冀南二十日电】临清三区经过反奸诉苦后，已经进行过检查，但仍有很多村庄存在着严重问题。刘×子村发现地主富农瞒地三顷以上，赤贫十多户未消灭，六户地主富农假当地二顷多，外村被斗户在该村卖寄庄地者亦不少。大辛庄赤贫十四户每人平均不到一亩半地。×庄查出地主寄庄地七十多亩，四小区十几个村查出地主典当地、寄庄地三顷多。大赤庄又重新进行了清算，追出浮财八、九百万元以上，平均每户分三万余元。六区进行查减后，近又发现很多村有遗漏与清算不彻底的地主。其原因是：一、区村干部划分阶层不明确，有许多户在群运前是地主，却评议成中农或富裕中农。小刘庄张春生，群运前只有五口人，良田九十亩，完全依靠长工耕种。他为了逃避斗争，前年便将土地分散隐蔽起来，但仍过着优裕的生活。在分析阶层时，竟评为富裕中农了。二、对消灭地主，单纯从土地留的多少来决定，多数地主的房产未动，如陆村四户地主，就保有百余间砖房。三、个别村干积极分子掩护地主，群众愿斗不敢斗。根据以上三种情况，现正重新组织力量，进行复查。
