Martial Arts Champion
    A Record of Wu'an Third District's Celebration of Heroes Who Performed Meritorious Service at the Front
    Qiao Lingxin, Li Jianhua

    On the twenty-second day of the first lunar month, the Wu'an Third District Office received fourteen bright red and eye-catching certificates of merit, with black characters printed on them and the names of fourteen people neatly written in brush. These were certificates of merit for the heroes who had performed meritorious service sent by the troops at the front in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. They were the first batch of heroes to emerge from the more than three hundred new soldiers who had joined the army from this district only last September. The district cadres excitedly gathered around to read the names and deeds of these heroes, praising the thorough and meticulous political work of the troops, rejoicing for the heroes and their families, and also feeling honored and happy that so many heroes had emerged from the district villages they personally led. The news quickly spread throughout the base points and villages. The cadres of the nine villages at the Tonghui base point were holding a meeting to study land investigation. When they heard the great news that three heroes had emerged from their base point, everyone was delighted. The cadres from the three villages where the heroes came from were even happier holding the certificates of merit. They all said that the heroes were performing meritorious service at the front to protect their liberation, and they must hold a grand celebration. The nine villages acted together. Some villages carved plaques with golden characters, some made hero banners, and the villages spread stories of the heroes: Zhang Hesheng of Dongdahe Village: "Established the merit of holding the Yangzhuang battle for a day and night in the Battle of Yutai, repelling seven enemy counterattacks"; Huang Sushan and Bai Yunxia: "Established the merit of being the first to rush to the roof and repulse the enemy in the Battle of Juye"; Wei Zhanqi of Wei Sushan... Heroic stories spread like a spring breeze to every household. The next day, representatives from each village formed a comfort group, carrying plaques and banners, and the children in large groups took "civil and military ceremonial weapons" and "golden melons and battle axes," and paraded through the nine villages with drums and gongs from Xidahe. The masses in each village cleaned the streets, pasted slogans, and formed large welcoming teams with drums and music early in the morning. The old people grinned toothlessly and said, "This is more impressive than a martial arts champion in the old days!"

    The team arrived at the hero's door, fired three cannons, hung up the plaque, inserted the banner, and posted the good news. The comfort group went in and placed the fiery red certificate of merit sent back by the troops on the central wall of the hall, and then congratulated the hero's family. Bai Yunxia's parents came out to thank them in new clothes. Old Man Bai happily said repeatedly: "Write to him at the front and tell him to perform more meritorious service. Tell him that nine villages have come to his home to congratulate him and even hung up a plaque..." When the team arrived at Wei Zhanqi's home, the courtyard was already full of dishes such as egg noodles and vermicelli, ready to entertain guests. The parents, relatives, and friends were all neatly dressed. His father was so excited that he didn't know what to say, just took off his hat and nodded repeatedly in thanks. When they arrived at Zhang Hesheng's home, he had no parents, only a seventeen-year-old wife. When the team arrived, she didn't know what to do, only busied herself with pouring boiling water, her cheeks glowing with cheerful red radiance. An old grandmother from her natal family said: "My grandson-in-law has a black mole between his eyebrows, that is the 'two dragons playing with a pearl' crown, which indicates nobility; he suffered from herding cattle since he was a child, the Eighth Route Army came and he was liberated, he voluntarily joined the army and performed meritorious service, it's really a meteoric rise."

    To celebrate the heroes, the Beianzhuang theater performed for three days, and the heroes' families, families of soldiers, and retired soldiers all sat in the front of the stage. The blackboards in each village all displayed the names and deeds of the heroes. On the twenty-eighth, at the horse fair in Boyan Village, the masses spontaneously organized a propaganda team and an eight-person story yangko dance, built a cypress branch archway, and hung embroidered curtains. In the center hung portraits of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and General Liu Bocheng, with the heroes' certificates of merit and deeds posted on both sides. Those who could read surrounded it and read, and those who couldn't read squeezed in to listen. A woman from Dongdahe squeezed to the front to inquire, and someone said: "Your village has produced a hero!" She couldn't close her mouth with a smile, because she was from the same village as the hero and felt infinitely honored. The masses read and said: "These people are good examples at home, and they perform meritorious service when they go out," "Bai Yunxia was honest and didn't talk much at home, he took the lead in joining the army last year after he was liberated, and he became a 'champion' this year!" The masses discussed endlessly, expressing their endless love and enthusiasm for the heroes.

　　武状元
    记武安三区庆祝前线立功英雄
    乔凌新　李建华
    正月二十二日，武安三区公所收到十四张鲜红醒目的奖状，上边印着黑字，毛笔整齐的填写着十四个人名。这是冀鲁豫前方部队寄来的立功英雄的奖状，是本区去年九月才参军的三百多个新战士中涌现的第一批英雄。区干部们兴奋的围着念这些英雄的名字和事迹，一面赞佩部队政治工作的周到细致，一面为英雄及英雄的家属们高兴，同时也因自己亲自领导的区村出了这多英雄而感到光荣和愉快。消息马上传遍了各基点、村庄，同会基点九个村的干部正在集会研究查田，当听到本基点出了三个英雄的大喜讯，个个欢喜，三个出英雄村的干部，拿着奖状更是高兴，都说英雄在前方立功保卫了咱们翻身，一定要大大庆贺。九个村一齐行动，有的村割金字大匾，有的作英雄大旗，各村纷纷传说英雄事迹：东大河村张河生：“鱼台歼灭战中，建立了坚持杨庄战斗一天一夜打退敌七次反扑的功劳”，黄粟山、白云霞：“巨野战斗中，建立了上房第一打退敌人的功劳”，魏粟山魏占棋……英勇的故事像春风一样吹遍了各家各户，第二天各村选出代表组成慰问团，抬上匾打上旗，孩子们成大群的拿上“文武执事”“金瓜钺斧”，鼓锣喧天的从西大河出发，周游九村。各村群众清早即打扫街道、粘贴标语，排成大队鼓乐迎送，老人们咧着没牙的嘴笑着说：“这比当年武状元还要威风！”
    大队到了英雄门前，鸣炮三声，挂上匾、插上旗、贴上喜报，慰问团进去把部队寄回的火红奖状安放中堂墙上，然后向英雄家属道喜。白云霞的父母换了新衣出来答谢，白老汉高兴得不断的说：“你们往前方给他去信，叫他好好多立功劳，就说九个村都来家贺喜，还挂的匾……”。队伍到了魏占棋家，院里早摆好鸡蛋粉皮等菜盘子，准备招待客人，家长亲友们都换的衣帽整齐，他父亲兴奋得不知说什么好，只是摘下帽子连连点头答谢。到张河生家，他家没父母，只有一个十七岁的妻子，大队一到，她不知如何是好，只忙着倒开水，两颊焕发着愉快红艳的光彩。她娘家一个老奶奶说：“外孙女婿两眉之间有个黑痣，那顶二龙戏珠，就是主贵；他从小放牛受苦，八路军来翻了身，自动参军又立下功，真是一步登天。”
    为了庆贺英雄，北安庄剧场唱戏三天，英雄家属、抗属、荣退军人都坐在台前边。各村大众黑板，都写出英雄姓名事迹。二十八日伯延村卖马大会上，群众又自动组织了宣传队和八班故事秧歌，搭了柏枝牌楼，绣花帏幔，正中挂着毛主席、朱总司令、刘伯承将军像，两旁贴着英雄奖状与事迹，识字的人围着念，不识字的挤着听；东大河一个妇女挤到跟前打听，有人说：“你村出了英雄啦！”她笑的合不住嘴，因为她和英雄同村，觉得有无限光荣。群众边念边说：“这些人在家就是好样，出门又立下功”，“白云霞在家老老实实不大说话，去年翻了身带头参军，今年就中了状元啦！”群众纷纷议论着，说不尽他们对英雄的敬爱热情。
