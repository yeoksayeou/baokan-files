[This Newspaper] The counties of Longping, Hengshui, Qinghe, and Julu, etc., have conducted profound self-examinations of past phenomena of not cherishing the people's strength and financial resources, and extravagance and waste. The movement for production and frugality has penetrated deeply into districts and villages. When the service personnel of the Longping First District Office reflected, the cook said: "I didn't want to burn sorghum when cooking before, only wanted to burn kindling. Every time there was a cadre meeting, I wanted a civilian to start the fire. As someone in charge of the stove, I now think I really shouldn't have!" The messenger said: "I didn't want to go to deliver letters without a horse or cart. Sometimes I went to the village office and asked cadres or civilians to deliver them, waited to get a receipt, and then went back to the district; I didn't issue receipts or grain coupons when eating in the village, and I didn't admit it when I was criticized." The groom said: "When grinding flour, I never wanted to use our own livestock, I wanted the village to grind it, so I could save some effort. When building grass sheds, I always said the grass cutter was not fast enough and had to find a civilian to sharpen it. Basically, I just didn't want to build the grass shed myself." After reflecting, the three people became very active. They said: "Let's do more work and save the people's strength to better serve the front lines!" The cadres of the Hengshui Sixth District Office only talked about production and frugality in the past, without actual action. This year, production emphasizes cadres doing it themselves, and specific plans have been made: 1. Accumulating fertilizer: Raising one pig, and using grass and wood ash, human manure, and horse manure, can accumulate twelve carts of fertilizer a year, which can supply five mu of land. 2. Planting ten ridges in the garden to solve the problem of eating vegetables for a year. 3. Five mu of wheat land will be used as this year's production fund, and late seedlings will be planted after the wheat harvest. 4. In addition to pulling carts and plowing the land, one horse will also be used for transportation. In terms of frugality, we must gradually reach the most difficult living conditions in the guerrilla environment, starting from daily work. At the appraisal meeting, the cadres of the Qinghe Third District reflected and recognized the hedonistic and paralyzing ideology, and resolved to produce and save. The cadres of Julu Fourth District proposed not smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and strictly adhering to the supply system. Do a good job in the rear and support the front line.
    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 16th] Various counties in Jinnan are examining and overcoming waste, and practicing frugality. In order to save village financial expenditure, the Longping Third District held a joint meeting of village cadres, stipulating that district cadres who eat in the village must implement the grain coupon system, and settle accounts at the end of the month. In order to facilitate approaching the masses and practicing a simple life, it is best to take turns eating with the common people. In addition, there are waste phenomena in many villages in the district. For example, the village cadres of Dazhangzhuang Residential Area eat in restaurants whenever they hold meetings. Once, when the cadre group leaders of fourteen villages in the entire residential area held a meeting, one meal wasted more than 10,000 yuan. The district cadres immediately educated and mobilized them, and the village cadres all brought dry food and did not eat in restaurants. In response to the call for frugality, Ningnan decided that when the district convenes village cadre meetings, village funds are not allowed to be spent and can be paid by the county's social grain. Rujiazhai in Daming First District has stipulated reasonable requisitioning methods to save manpower: 1. Assign work according to the nature of the task and the people available, dividing the tasks into light, heavy, urgent and non-urgent. For example, stretcher teams transporting public grain, firewood, grass, ammunition, etc. to the front are considered urgent and heavy tasks, while transporting public grain, husking rice, and grinding flour over short distances in the rear are considered heavy tasks, and making military shoes and providing labor for military families, guiding the way, and delivering letters are considered light tasks. All the manpower and animal power in the village is divided into several units according to their physical strength to undertake different tasks. Young and middle-aged people and large carts can undertake urgent and heavy tasks, while elderly people and small carts and donkey teams can undertake heavy tasks, and children and women can undertake light tasks. 2. Calculate labor according to the task, and return labor according to the task. Each unit is under unified leadership and unified calculation of labor. The labor is adjusted and returned by each unit, and the accounts are uniformly made up at the time of settlement.

　　隆平衡水等地克服铺张浪费现象
    节约运动深入区村
    【本报讯】隆平、衡水、清河、巨鹿等县，领导上深刻检查过去不爱惜民力、财力，铺张浪费现象。生产节约的运动，深入区村。隆平一区公所勤杂人员反省时，伙夫说：“我先前作饭不愿烧秫，光愿烧片柴，一开干部会，就愿要个民夫给烧火，自当掌灶的，我这会想着真不该！”交通员说：“我送信时没马没车子就不愿去，有时到村公所叫干部或民夫送，等拿回条来，我再回区；在村里吃饭不开条不给粮票，批评我还不认。”马夫说：“磨面时，我老不愿用咱的牲口，愿叫村里给磨，我好省点劲。砌草时，我老说铡不快，得找个民夫磨铡，基本上是我不愿砌草。”经反省后，三人转变的很积极，他们说：“咱们多作点活，省下民力好给前线服务！”衡水六区公所干部，过去只口头上说生产节约，没有实际行动，今年生产强调干部亲自动手，并作了具体计划：一、积肥：养猪一口、及草木灰、人粪、马粪，一年能积十二车粪，可供五亩地之用。二、种园子十畦，解决一年的吃菜问题。三、五亩麦地作为今年生产基金，麦后种上晚苗。四、马一匹，除拉车耕地外即搞运输。在节约上要逐步作到游击环境中最艰苦之生活程度，从日常办事着手。清河三区干部在鉴定会上，反省与认识了享乐麻痹思想，决心生产节约。巨鹿四区干部提出不吸纸烟、喝酒、严格供给制度。把后方工作作好，支援前线。
    【本报冀南十六日电】冀南各县检查克服浪费，厉行节约。为节省村财政开支，隆平三区曾召开村干联席会，规定区干到村吃饭，一律执行粮票制度，月底结账，为便利接近群众与锻炼简朴生活，最好轮流跟老百姓吃。另该区不少村存在浪费现象，如大张庄小区村干逢开会即在饭铺吃饭，有一次全小区十四个村的干部小组长开会时，一顿饭即浪费一万余元。区干当即教育动员，各村干部都带干粮，不到饭铺吃饭。为响应节约号召，宁南决定，区召开村干会时不准开支村款，可由县社会粮开支。大名一区儒家寨为节约民力规定合理支差办法：一、按差按人分工，把差务分成轻重缓急。如担架队往前方输送公粮柴草弹药等为急重差，在后方短距离调剂公粮、碾米磨面为重差，做军鞋给军属支差，带路送信等为轻差。把全村所有人畜力按其体力大小组成几个单位，分别担任。青壮年及大车队可担任急重差，老年及小车队、小驴队可担任重差，儿童、妇女可担任轻差。二、按差计工，按差还工。各单位统一领导，统一计工，由各单位调剂还工，结账时统一按工账补齐。
