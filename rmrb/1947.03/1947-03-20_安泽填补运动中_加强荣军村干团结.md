　　Anze in the filling-in movement
    Strengthening Unity Between Veterans and Village Cadres
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 18th] Anze has satisfactorily resolved the problem of unity between veterans and village cadres in the filling-in movement. In the past, some local cadres did not provide enough assistance to veterans, and many veterans' issues concerning farmland, production, and marriage were not resolved. Some veterans, on the other hand, were arrogant and took credit for their service, often making excessive demands, disrespecting local customs, or being politically apathetic and misled by landlords and special agents, resulting in insufficient unity with the village government. At the beginning of this year's filling-in movement, brawls between veterans and local cadres occurred in the Second and Sixth Districts. Upon discovering this problem, the county government immediately dispatched the deputy county head to resolve it. First, the district and village cadres were educated to correct their contempt for veterans, and when necessary, to apologize to the veterans, expressing the government's determination to resolve all their difficulties in the filling-in movement. Through various veterans' organizations from the village to the county level, their opinions were listened to, and their status was enhanced. Their representatives were absorbed as much as possible to participate in village, district, and county meetings, making them an active factor in assisting the government's work. At the same time, education for veterans, especially discharged soldiers, was strengthened to make them realize that the government was earned by their own blood and sweat, and they must respect government laws and rural customs. The past antagonistic sentiment between veterans and local cadres has gradually turned into unity.

　　安泽填补运动中
    加强荣军村干团结
    【本报太岳十八日电】安泽在填补运动中，圆满的解决了荣退军人与村干的团结问题。过去有些地方干部对荣退军人帮助不够，不少荣退军人的耕地、生产、婚姻问题未得解决。有些荣退军人则骄傲居功，往往提出过高要求，或不尊重当地风俗习惯，或政治麻痹，误被地主特务挑拨离间，与村政权不够团结。今年填补运动之初，二、六等区曾发生荣退军人结伙与地方干部斗殴情事。县府发现这一问题，即派副县长亲自下乡解决。首先教育区村干部，纠正轻视荣退军人的观念，必要时向荣退军人道歉，表明政府在填补运动中解决他们一切困难的决心。通过荣退军人自村至县的各种组织，倾听他们的意见，提高他们的地位，村区县会议尽可能吸收他们的代表参加，使之成为帮助政府工作的积极因素。同时加强对荣退军人特别是退伍军人的教育，使他们认识政府是自己血汗换来的，必须尊重政府法令和农村风俗习惯。过去荣退军人与地方干部对立的情绪乃逐渐变为团结。
