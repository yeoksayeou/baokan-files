　　Bianfu General Affairs Office Implements Thrift Spirit:
　　New Measures for Office Miscellaneous Expenses
　　Guest House Organizes Resident Cadre Production

　　[Our Newspaper] In order to implement the spirit of production and thrift, the General Affairs Office of the Bianfu (Border Region Government) has implemented two new measures starting in March: first, changing office expenses to cash payments; second, establishing a public restaurant to provide meals for the sick. In the past, the issuance of office supplies was largely unrestricted, resulting in much waste, making it difficult for the General Affairs Office to control the budget and final accounts. It has now been decided that each comrade will be temporarily issued 400 yuan per day for office expenses; any savings can be kept by the individual, and many comrades have voluntarily expressed their willingness to save and hand over the funds to the public. Since the implementation of this measure, the atmosphere of thrift has improved, and the General Affairs Office has also reduced its troubles, benefiting both the public and private sectors. In the past, there were many problems with meals for the sick; sometimes, just one sick person would occupy a stove, requiring someone to cook for them; sometimes, when there were many patients, it was difficult to satisfy everyone. The General Affairs Office provided a lot of food money for the sick, but the patients did not receive real benefits. Now it has been decided that sick people will eat at restaurants, buying whatever they want to eat, and the miscellaneous staff can also share the profits, saving expenses as well.

　　[Another News] The General Affairs Office of the Bianfu achieved great success in organizing institutional production last year, laying the foundation for this year's production work. The focus of the office's work this year, in addition to improving the supply cooperative and the public restaurant, will be to vigorously promote and assist individual production within the institution. It has already lent out spinning wheels, cotton (three jin per person), and production funds (1,500 yuan per person). With concrete help, the comrades' enthusiasm for production is even higher.

　　[Our Newspaper] In response to the call for production and thrift, the cadres transferred and staying at the Bianfu Guest House discussed how to participate in production, given the fluidity of their transfers. First, they dispelled the notion that "officials don't repair the yamen, and guests don't repair the inn." Everyone actively participates in production. The guest house established a tofu workshop and found wasteland. Transferring cadres who come and go can participate in grinding or reclaiming land. In addition, individuals can also collect manure and cut firewood. The guest house calculates the work on time and at price, and introduces it to the transferred organization when they are transferred to their new job, which can count towards their production task.

　　边府总务处贯彻节约精神
    订办公杂支新办法
    招待所组织住所干部生产
    【本报讯】边府总务处贯彻生产节约精神，于三月份起，实行两种新措施：一为办公费改发现金，二为设立大众饭店以供给病号伙食。过去所发办公用品多无限制，因之很多浪费，总务处很难掌握预决算。现决定办公费，各个同志每日暂发四百元，如有节约归自己，许多同志则自动表示节约缴公。本办法实行以来，节约空气提高，总务处也减少麻烦，公私两利。过去病号饭问题很多，有时只一个病号，也占一炉火，还得一个人作饭；有时病人多了，作出饭来又很难满每个人意，总务处补给病号菜金很多，而病人得不到实利。现决定病号上馆子吃饭，想吃什么买什么，杂务人员也可分红，开支也节约了。
    【又讯】边府总务处去年组织机关生产很有成绩，给今年生产工作打下基础。该处今年工作中心，除健全供给合作社及大众饭店外，将大力推动帮助机关个人生产，现已贷出纺车、棉花（每人三斤）及生产基金（每人一千五百元）。同志们得到具体帮助，生产热情更高。

    【本报讯】响应生产节约号召，住边府招待所之调动干部，根据调动之流动性讨论如何参加生产问题，首先解除“官不修衙客不修店”的思想，大家积极生产，由招待所成立豆腐坊和找荒地，来往的调动干部，谁来谁即可参加推磨或开荒。此外个人尚可拾粪割柴，招待所按时按价计算，调动工作时介绍予调动之机关，可顶生产任务。
