　　Introduction to the Licheng Joint Office
    Yang Kehong
    The Licheng Office was established under the unified leadership of the Party and government, to unify the use of forces and improve work efficiency. The office organization is based on the county government office, with specialists drawn from various systems to form a joint office in an all-encompassing manner. Since its formation in late March two years ago, it has become a powerful assistant to the leadership. The task of the joint office is to organize investigation and research on central tasks, organize and summarize materials, keep abreast of county-level newspapers, organize reports, and reflect and guide practical work.
    Our joint office has a total of five comrades, with four comrades regularly participating in the actual work of a village in person. These villages are all typical villages that can lead and demonstrate for the entire county. The office treats them as liaison villages, regularly understanding the thoughts and work of the masses, and cooperating with district and village cadres to create experience and discover problems in actual movements, providing the leadership with information for research and mastering the situation, and guiding the movement. For example, before spring plowing began the year before last, the office investigated the thinking of the masses at all levels in Xia Village and the preparations for spring plowing, and interviewed the masses on how to exceed the large-scale production movement of any previous year. Labor hero Wang Fengqi and rich peasant Wang Xuande both said: "It is difficult to achieve 'cultivate three and have a surplus of one' without planting cotton, Golden Queen corn, and developing textiles." This practical experience of the masses, after being concentrated and studied by the office, was reflected to the county's leading comrades as a basis for determining leadership policies and lines. Last year, in implementing the Central Bureau's supplementary instructions on "the tiller owns his field," the office cooperated with district-level responsible cadres to investigate the implementation of the movement in eleven villages of three types (advanced, general, backward), and found that feudal landlords in villages such as Xijing and Dongyangguan still retained considerable land, and the exploitation and oppression of the masses by treacherous and domineering landlords was still quite severe. In Dongyangguan, out of the entire village of 498 households, there were still 88 poor peasants who did not have enough land to cultivate, and 38 extremely poor households who had no land to cultivate, breaking the almost universal idea in the old liberated area of Licheng (of course, rent reduction in Licheng was basically thorough). The method of combining production with investigation and rent reduction was tested in Dongyangguan and Dongyadi villages to create experience and guide the smooth progress of the current actual movement.
    In guiding the central task, in addition to gaining in-depth understanding of typical materials in the villages with which they are fixedly connected and helping the county party committee study typical experiences, the office comrades regularly or irregularly receive work reports from county and district cadres and various organizational systems at the district and village levels, or letters related to work. After the responsible comrade has read them, they are promptly forwarded to the joint office, so that the office comrades can regularly understand the overall situation. For typical materials of a comprehensive nature in each movement, the office immediately organizes and prints them into circulars, giving criticism and praise, and promptly exchanges experiences through small newspapers. The office's work can achieve results mainly because it is determined by the county's unified leadership. The unified leadership in Licheng, from top to bottom, has solved the problem ideologically for the cadres. Specific personnel are designated to collect some specialized problems and experiences, but the office is mainly responsible for comprehensive investigation tasks, and temporary forces are organized to complete them. In addition, the office comrades have the opportunity to participate in county party committee research meetings on central tasks and joint meetings of district heads and secretaries to enhance their understanding of the actual situation and improve the office comrades' ability to analyze and criticize problems. Experience has proved that doing a good job in the office not only plays the role of assistant to the leadership but also improves the work ability of the cadres.
    The office's compilation and printing of small newspapers guide the central work of the entire county on the one hand, and preserve materials on the other hand. In guiding the central work, it is irregular and does not adhere to any fixed form. Whatever the actual work is below, we will publish it. Some specialized typical experiences are printed out in the form of circulars. For example, during spring plowing, we can receive 27 manuscripts a day. Based on the manuscripts written by those below, we understand the development of the actual work.
    In the past, the county's joint office led the communication work of the districts and villages. Last spring, when the county rectified the communication organization, it formed a communication committee based on the joint office. The head of the county party committee propaganda department and the head of the county government education section both participated, strengthening the leadership of the communication work. The districts organized central communication groups, and the village communication groups were based on primary school teachers, combined with village cadres for research, and implemented by primary school teachers. Some villages combined writing newsletters, reading newspapers, and blackboards. For example, in Beiliu, cadres studied once every ten days, researched the work once, and reported the work of the previous ten days. This has played a great role in improving the cadres' ability to promote work.

　　黎城联合办公室介绍
    杨克虹
    黎城办公室是在党政一元化领导下，为了统一使用力量提高工作效率的要求建立的。办公室组织以县政府办公室为基础，各系统抽出专人，组织一揽子形式的联合办公室。自前年三月底组成以后，成为领导上的有力助手。联合办公室的任务，是组织中心工作的调查研究、整理总结材料，掌握县里小报，组织报导，反映和指导实际工作。
    我们联合办公室共五个同志，经常有四个同志在村里亲自参加一个村的实际工作。这些村都是能以带领与示范全县的典型村，办公室把他作为联系村，经常了解群众思想与工作情况，配合区村干部在实际运动中创造经验，发现问题，提供领导上研究掌握情况，指导运动。例如前年春耕还没有开始，办公室即调查了一下霞庄村的群众各阶层思想与春耕准备情形，访问了群众如何做到超过已往任何一年的大生产运动，劳动英雄王逢歧和富农王宣德都说：“不种棉花、金皇后，不开展纺织，就很难做到耕三余一。”群众这种实际体验，经过办公室集中起来研究以后，反映给县的领导同志，作为在确定领导方针与路线时的根据。去年执行中央局耕者有其田的填补指示中，办公室配合区里负责干部调查了三个类型（先进、一般、落后）十一个村运动贯彻情形，发现西井、东阳关等村的封建地主还保有相当土地，奸霸地主的剥削压榨群众还相当厉害。东阳关全村四百九十八户，还有地不够种的贫农八十八户，无地种的赤贫三十八户，打破了黎城老区差不多的思想（当然黎城减租基本上是彻底的）。在东阳关、东崖底两村试验生产与查减结合的办法，以便创造经验；指导当前实际运动顺利进行。
    办公室同志在指导中心工作方式上，除在自己固定联系的村子，深入了解典型材料，帮助县委研究典型经验外；有关于县区干部及区村各个组织系统定期或不定期的工作汇报，或有关工作方面的信件，在负责同志看过后，都及时的转交联合办公室，以使办公室同志经常了解全面情况，对每个运动中全面性的典型材料，办公室即把它整理编印通报，给以批评和表扬，并通过小报及时交流经验。办公室的工作，能获得成绩，主要是决定于县里的统一领导。黎城的统一领导，自上而下的干部，是从思想上解决了问题的。对一些专门问题及经验是指定专人去搜集的，但是对有关全面性的调查任务是以办公室为主，临时组织力量完成的。另外，在县委开研究中心工作会议以及区长分书联席会议时，办公室同志都有机会参加，以增强对实际情况的了解，提高办公室同志分析批判问题的能力。经验证明，办公室工作搞好，不但是起了领导上的助手作用，同时提高了干部工作能力。
    办公室编印小报，一方面指导了全县的中心工作，另一方面又保存了材料。在指导中心工作方面，它是不定期而且也不拘形式，下边实际工作做甚，我们就登载甚，有些专门典型经验，就以通报形式印出去。如春耕时，我们一天可收到二十七件稿子，根据下边写来的稿件，我们了解了实际工作的发展情况。
    县里过去是联合办公室领导区村通讯工作，去年春县里整顿通讯组织时，又以联合办公室为基础，组成通讯委员会，县委宣传部及县府教育科长都参加了，加强了对通讯工作的领导。区里组织了中心通讯小组，村里边的通讯小组，是以小学教员为骨干，结合村干部研究以后，由小学教员执行。有的村里把写通讯读报黑板报结合起来，如北流逢十干部就学习一次，研究一次工作，把前十天的工作情况报导一次。这样在提高干部推动工作上，都起了很大作用。
