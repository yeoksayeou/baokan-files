　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 28th: Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, attempting to invade Xinle and Mancheng in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, have been repeatedly repelled. On the 18th, Chiang's troops drove more than a thousand "Homecoming Legions" to Dongchangshou, followed by three regiments of the 7th Division of Chiang's 3rd Army from Shijiazhuang, attempting to invade Xinle again. They were met with a head-on blow by the local Eighth Route Army, which captured 93 Chiang's soldiers and killed or wounded hundreds. The Chiang's troops have now retreated to the Xin'an Station area. In addition, approximately five companies of Liu Huanan's unit of the puppet 2nd Security Column advanced towards Nanji Village, southeast of Mancheng, on the 22nd. They were met with a counterattack by the Eighth Route Army, suffering more than 20 casualties and retreating to Baoding.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 26th: Villages in the Tanghu area (under Yi County), which were briefly occupied by two regiments of Chiang's troops on the 14th, were forced to retreat by the local army and people through various means of encirclement and harassment the next day. The local democratic government is now actively carrying out rehabilitation work.
