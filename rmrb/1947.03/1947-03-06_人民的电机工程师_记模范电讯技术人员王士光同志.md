　　The People's Electrical Engineer
    Remembering Comrade Wang Shiguang, Model Telecommunications Technician
    When you mention "Big Wang," everyone in the telecommunications field knows him, and they all respect and feel close to him. The origin of this nickname comes from his tall stature, coupled with his simplicity, steadiness, and amiability. If we use a play on words and call him the "Electrical Engineering King" of this region, it is probably not an overstatement. He is a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University in Beiping. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1937 and has been working in telecommunications maintenance in the Liberated Areas since 1939. Due to his research-oriented nature and continuous efforts to learn, his achievements in theory and technology over the past eight or nine years have deeply impressed Professor Michael Lindsay, a British physics professor. Even now, Professor Lindsay still writes to Big Wang from afar in England, his words filled with respect.

    Last year, our Big Wang obtained a newly published American textbook on electrical engineering. To gain something from this book, he kept reading it. At 4 PM, he still thought it was not yet noon. When it was time for dinner, he seemed to value the preciousness of time more than eating, reluctant to leave until evening. He always lamented that time passed too quickly. Sometimes, he would work under the lamplight to complete a machine.

    In July of last year, the higher authorities gave him the task of setting up a broadcasting station. He found some parts from piles of old machine parts. In the eyes of bourgeois engineers, these parts would have long been considered scrap metal. However, our Big Wang cherished these parts, carefully wiping and repairing them, like a repairman turning the bad into good. Working day and night, malaria and dysentery simultaneously invaded his weakened body, instantly turning him pale and emaciated, unable to eat. It was hard for everyone to believe that he could continue working. They gave him much advice, urging him to rest. However, he firmly rejected everyone's advice with the words, "If I stop working because of some illness, it would be a loss to the revolution." He moved his bed to the workshop and continued his assembly work on the sickbed. Finally, on September 1st, the whole country heard the broadcast of the Handan Broadcasting Station for the first time. From Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and even distant Kunming, telegrams poured in, praising the clarity of the signal, inspiring democratic figures across the country, and exciting all of us in the Liberated Areas. The success of this pioneering feat in the entire border region is inseparable from the efforts of Comrade Wang Shiguang.

    The Kuomintang reactionaries attacked the Liberated Areas with American-equipped troops. After we annihilated them in entire divisions and brigades, not only did our troops have American equipment, but the telecommunications departments also became equipped with American "gear." Indeed, we captured many American machines, such as telegraphs, transceivers, telephones… and so on. These various machines seemed very complex, but our Comrade Wang Shiguang was very familiar with them all, not only able to use them but also able to repair the broken ones and modify the unusable ones into usable ones. As a result, our telecommunications departments widely used American machines or machines assembled with American parts. Comrade Wang Shiguang once said excitedly in a humorous tone, "Under the reactionary policy of the American government assisting Chiang in the civil war, our machines have been improved, and efficiency has been increased. We should really thank them!"

    Comrade Wang Shiguang has many new creations in electrical engineering. He never recites or confines himself to the dogmas in books. On the contrary, outside of dogmas and formulas, he uses all kinds of parts to assemble new circuits and new machines. And our parts are so limited and so old. However, the machines assembled with this "scrap metal" have such good efficiency that the telegraph operators are full of praise. Unfortunately, he spends more than twelve hours a day in the workshop assembling and testing, and he also has to handle administrative issues, so he does not have time to write down these new creations and valuable experiences for everyone to learn.

    His simple and austere lifestyle is also worthy of praise. If someone criticizes him for not being very hygienic, I think he has no choice but to accept it. His family is capitalist, but he spends three-quarters of the year without wearing socks. He has never bought anything to wear or eat, always eating from the communal pot. If someone makes extra food for him to take care of his health, he will sternly refuse. He always walks during marches. Due to overwork, his body is weakened. The higher authorities gave him some money to improve his nutrition, but he distributed the money to everyone, rewarding model workers and labor heroes.

    With his help and leadership, our maintenance personnel have greatly improved in theory and technology. Under the influence of his style, many model workers emerged among the maintenance personnel last year. With a small number of people, they supported and completed tasks several times greater than those during the War of Resistance. In the merit-making campaign, Comrade Wang Shiguang was the first person to be credited. No wonder he is recognized as a model Party member and a model technician!

　　人民的电机工程师
    记模范电讯技术人员王士光同志
    一提到大王，在电讯人员里都是熟悉的，而且大家都存在着对他的佩服和亲热。这个称呼的来源，由于他是一个高大的个子，加上他的朴素稳重与和霭，如果我们一语双关的说他是这个区域的“电机工程大王”，大概是不过份的。他是北平清华大学电机工程科的毕业生，一九三七年即参加了中国共产党，从一九三九年就到解放区作电讯机务工作，由于他的富于研究性和不间断的努力学习，八九年来，在理论与技术上的成就是曾深得英国物理学教授林迈可先生的无限佩服的，直到现在，林迈可教授还远从英伦致函大王，词句里充满着敬意。
    去年，咱们大王得到一本美国新出版的原文电机工程学，他为了从这本书里得到点什么，就一直看起来，下午四点了，他还以为不到十二点，到了开饭的时间，他似乎把时间的宝贵超过了吃饭，没舍得离开，一直到晚上。他总是叹息时间过的太快，有时为了完成一部机器，在灯光下工作的事情更是不少。
    去年七月间，上级给了他装置广播电台的任务，他便从破旧的机器零件堆里找出一些零件来，这些零件如果在资产阶级工程师的眼里早把它看成废铜烂铁了，可是我们大王却把这些零件珍重的加以擦拭和修理，好像修理匠似的把坏的变成好的，由于日夜辛劳，疟疾和痢疾同时侵入了他衰弱的身体，顿时面黄肌瘦、饮食不进，大家很难相信他还能继续工作了，给了他许多劝告，要他休息，可是他以“如果身体有些病而停止工作，那是革命的损失”的话坚决拒绝了大家的劝告，他把卧床搬到工作室里，在病床上继续他的装配工作。终于九月一日全国各地第一次听到了邯郸广播电台的播音，平津京沪以至遥远的昆明都纷纷来电，称赞讯号的清晰，振奋了全国的民主人士，兴奋了我们全解放区的人们，这个全边区的创举的成功是与王士光同志的努力分不开的。
    国民党反动派以美械化部队进攻解放区，当它整师整旅被我们消灭之后，不仅我们部队有了美械陌备，电讯部门也都成了美“械”的装备了。确实我们缴获了不少美式机器，如电报机、报话机、电话机……等等，这些各式机器看来都是很复杂的，但我们王士光同志却都很熟悉，不仅能够使用，而且能把坏的修成好的、不能用的改装成能用的，致使我们电讯部门相当普遍地使用起美国机器或以美国零件装成的机器来。王士光同志曾经兴奋的以滑稽的口吻说：“在美国政府助蒋内战的反动政策下，倒改良了我们的机器，提高了效率，真该谢谢他们！”
    王士光同志在电机工程上有许多新的创造，他绝不背诵或局限于书籍上的教条，相反的他在教条与公式以外，用各种各样的零件装配成新的线路和新的机器，而我们的零件又是那么有限那么破旧，可是这以“破铜烂铁”装成的机器，效率又是那么好，使报务人员赞不绝口。可惜的是他在每天在工作室进行十二小时以上的装配和试验工作，并且还要处理行政问题，因之没有时间把这些新的创造和宝贵的经验写出来，使大家来学习一下。
    他生活上的艰苦朴素，也是值得表扬的，如果有人批评他不很讲卫生的话，我想他是无法不接受的，他的家庭是一个资本家，而他却是一年四分之三的时间不穿袜子，他从没有买过一件穿用的东西或吃的东西，一向吃大锅饭，如果为了照顾他的身体给他另外作点饭，那会遭到严厉的拒绝。行军向来是步行，由于工作过于繁忙，因而身体衰弱，上级给了他些钱叫他营养，可是他把这钱分给了大家，奖给了工作模范和劳动英雄。
    在他帮助与领导下，我们的机务人员在理论和技术上大大提高了一步，而在他的作风影响下，去年在机务人员中涌现了不少的工作模范，以少数的人，支持并完成了数倍于抗战期间的任务，在立功运动中，王士光同志是第一个有功的人，这也无怪乎他被公认为模范党员，模范技术人员！
