Chiang Kai-shek, in violation of historical agreements, brazenly carried out the diversion of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, closing the breach on March 15th and completely changing the river's course. The surging Yellow River water poured in, and since our region's levee construction was not yet completed, the fields, homes, and lives of the people along the river in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region were under serious threat. For the past six months, Chiang Kai-shek has mobilized large armies to attack the liberated areas, and wherever his troops have gone, the rich and poor have suffered, forging a blood feud with the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. Now he has arbitrarily diverted the water, causing a severe Yellow River disaster, adding a new debt of blood to his record of crimes.

On December 27th of last year, Chiang Kai-shek secretly released a stream of water into the old course at Huayuankou. At the time, he did it surreptitiously. Knowing he was in the wrong, he dared not admit to diverting the water and instead made excuses like "upstream water levels are high" and the riverbank "was breached by the current." A few days later, on January 3rd of this year, Tad, the chief engineer of the Nationalist government's Water Conservancy Commission of the Yellow River, and our representatives met in Handan, agreeing to postpone the diversion for five months. Tad even said that the excavated breach would be blocked on the 4th. This verbal agreement was not implemented; it was a deception. In mid-February, another agreement was reached in Shanghai: "The date for closing the breach will be decided by the Water Conservancy Commission, UNRRA, CNRRA, and the Liberated Area representatives in mid-March based on the actual needs of the project." Only half a month later, Chiang Kai-shek arbitrarily decided to divert all the water. Looking back at the four agreements in Kaifeng, Heze, Nanjing, and Shanghai, some stipulated that levees should be restored before the breach was closed, others that the breach should be closed and the levees restored simultaneously, with the principle that closing the breach should not cause flooding downstream, and others specified the concrete figures for labor, food, funds, and resident relocation expenses. These agreements became scraps of paper as soon as they were signed. Chiang Kai-shek's agreements on the Yellow River issue, like his agreements on other military and political issues, were used as a shield to deceive and lull the people of the Liberated Areas and to mislead public opinion among just people at home and abroad, while he hid behind this shield to carry out his evil activities. Now everything has been revealed: Chiang Kai-shek has broken his promise in six agreements and implemented the total diversion of water. His lack of credibility and shame has once again been exposed to the people of the country and the world. The true nature of a Shanghai gangster and the face of the Hitlerite gang have once again been revealed. Those who still have illusions about Chiang Kai-shek should consider this incident another good lesson.

The Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda machine often says that early water diversion is beneficial to the project because of the small spring flow. In fact, from an engineering perspective, how can the upstream divert water before the downstream levee construction is completed? If it is forced to divert water, it is not for the benefit of the project, but to sabotage the project and put the people to death. Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan people have restored 1,462 li of dikes in just over ten days, which is very enthusiastic. However, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries delayed our work food and funds, robbed and destroyed our equipment and materials, strafed our levee restoration workers, and bombed us repeatedly with airplanes, forcing our levee restoration and repair work to be unable to continue, and even destroying the new dikes we built. As a result, when Chiang Kai-shek diverted all the water, we still had more than 30 dangerous projects unfinished and more than 400 li of levee unrepaired. Chiang Kai-shek is actively diverting water and destroying our repairs by barbaric and cruel means. His logic is: "I divert water but I will not allow you to repair dikes," which is his "engineering" point of view. Chiang Kai-shek is losing battles and his military crisis is deepening. His rear is experiencing economic collapse, people are struggling to survive, and popular uprisings are breaking out everywhere. The flames of mass struggle cannot be suppressed by rampant terror. In such a difficult situation, he uses the flooding of the Liberated Areas to boost morale, enhance prestige, and divide the Liberated Areas with the Yellow River to achieve his military conspiracy. But what he will get will be the opposite of his hope, and the people of the Liberated Areas will surely turn their anger into strength, accelerating his path to failure.

We, the 30 million people of the entire region, resolutely protest Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous act of arbitrarily closing the breach and diverting water, deliberately drowning the 7 million people along the river in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. We call on the just people of the country and the world to stand on humanitarian grounds, rise up to denounce Chiang Kai-shek's criminal actions, and provide assistance to the people suffering from the Yellow River disaster created by Chiang Kai-shek. We demand that UNRRA make a statement on this matter. UNRRA came to China to benefit the Chinese people, but each time you have participated in the agreement, you have not urged Chiang Kai-shek to implement the agreement, which in fact has helped Chiang Kai-shek deceive the Chinese people and mislead world public opinion. Chiang Kai-shek disregarded the will of the people in the Liberated Areas and implemented the breach closure and water diversion, using your machines, tools and technical personnel. If the victims of the Yellow River disaster regard you as Chiang Kai-shek's accomplices, how can you explain yourselves? Now the lives and property of the people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in our region are in a very critical disaster. It is time for you to speak.

The people and cadres of Hebei-Shandong-Henan have been resisting Chiang Kai-shek's military offensive for half a year. At the same time, under the conditions of scarce materials, continuous strafing and bombing by Chiang's planes, and the lack of food and housing for the masses, they have carried out emergency repairs to the dikes and achieved great results, which have been commended by the Border Government. Now they should be urgently mobilized, organized to fight against the Yellow River disaster, and launch a mass self-rescue movement. Residents of the riverbed should move immediately. There should be organized emergency repairs to the dikes to protect the dikes, to build and repair ships. We must use our own strength to eliminate the disaster, and continue the spirit of the self-defense war and river management work of the past six months, and work harder to carry out self-rescue work. Fathers and brothers of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, you are by no means isolated. People from all over the region are closely watching your disaster today, and praising and learning from your heroic struggle. The hearts of the people of the whole region are with you. Your pain is everyone's pain, and your victory is everyone's victory. In the past, you have had support from all over the country, and this support movement should be carried out more vigorously in the future. With the experience of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the one-year self-defense war, and with the people of the whole region as a backing, you will surely overcome the Yellow River disaster.

Nine years ago, Chiang Kai-shek created a disaster area in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu area, causing six million people to be displaced or tragically sacrificed. Now Chiang Kai-shek is going to create a new disaster area (the old river course), and he shamelessly claims that it is for the benefit of the people in the old disaster area (the new flooded area). Why does he favor the people in the old disaster area alone? Isn't the Chiang-controlled area everywhere a disaster area where the people cannot live? The disasters of the old disaster area, the new disaster area, and the entire Chinese people are all caused by Chiang Kai-shek. He is the root cause of the disaster. Without abolishing his reactionary rule, the people along the river in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the entire Liberated Area people, and the entire Chinese people cannot live. Our people along the river and the entire region should rescue the Yellow River disaster and at the same time more bravely carry out the patriotic self-defense war, annihilate more Chiang's troops, and strive to end Chiang Kai-shek's disastrous rule.

    抢救蒋介石造成的黄灾
    蒋介石违背历史协议，已在花园口悍然实行合龙放水，三月十五日堵死口门，黄河全部改道。滔滔黄水，倾泻而来，而我区堤工，尚未完成，冀鲁豫沿河人民的田园庐舍，身家性命都处在严重威胁之中。半年来蒋介石调集大军进攻解放区，兽蹄所至，穷富遭殃，已和我冀鲁豫人民结下血海深仇，现在他又擅自放水，造成严重黄灾，更在他的罪恶簿上记下一笔新的血债。
    去年十二月二十七日，蒋介石就在花园口放了一股水流入故道。当时他是偷偷摸摸做的。自知理亏，不敢承认放水，才说了些“上流水位高涨”，河堤“系被水流冲开”之类的鬼话。过了几天，今年一月三日国民党政府水利委员会黄河总工程师塔德等和我方在邯郸开会，商定延缓五个月放水，塔德还说四日即将所掘之口堵住。这个口头协议并未实行，原来是个骗局。到了二月中旬，又在上海达到协议：“合龙日期至三月中旬视工程实际需要再由水委会、联总、行总及解放区四方面会商决定。”才过了半个月蒋介石却擅自决定全部放水了。回想去年开封、荷泽、南京、上海等四个协议，或规定先复堤后堵口，或堵口复堤同时并进，以堵口不使下游发生水灾为原则，或规定工料、工粮、工款及居民迁移费的具体数字。这些协定都是签订之后，即成废纸。蒋介石对黄河问题的协定，和对其他军事、政治问题的协定一样，是以协定为挡箭牌，欺骗、麻痹解放区人民，蒙蔽国内外正义人士的舆论，而他则躲在这块挡箭牌下面干其罪恶的活动。现在一切都揭开了，蒋介石违背六次协议的诺言，实行全部放水了。他的不要信义、不要廉耻，又一次暴露在全国和全世界人民面前了。上海流氓的本相、希特勒匪帮的面貌，又一次现出原形了。对蒋介石还有幻想的人，应当认为这次事件又是给自己好好上了一课。
    蒋介石御用机关常说，提早放水，是因为春季水小，对工程有利。其实就以工程来说，下游堤工未修好，上游如何能放水？倘若强要放水，那不是为了对工程有利，而是为了破坏工程，为了置人民于死地。我冀鲁豫人民曾在十几天内复堤堰一四六二里，热诚可谓很高。而蒋介石反动派拖延我工粮工款，抢劫、破坏我器材物资，扫射我复堤员工，并以飞机轮番狂炸，迫使我复堤修险工作不能继续进行，甚至挖毁我方所筑之新堤。结果，当蒋介石全部放水之时，我尚有险工三十余处未完成，堤工四百余里未修复。蒋介石一面积极进行放水，一面以野蛮残酷手段破坏我方修堤，他的逻辑是：“我放水但不许你修堤”，这就是他的“工程”观点。蒋介石连打败仗，军事危机日深，其后方则经济崩溃，民不聊生，民变四起，各地疯狂的恐怖，已压抑不住群众斗争的火焰。在这样苦境中，他就以水淹解放区来提高其士气，壮其声威，并用黄水分割解放区以遂其军事阴谋，但他所得的，将是他的希望的反面，解放区人民必将把忿怒变为力量，加速使他走到失败。
    我全区三千万人民坚决抗议蒋介石这一背信弃义擅自堵口放水，蓄意淹死冀鲁豫沿河七百万人民的滔天罪行。我们呼吁全国及全世界正义人士站在人道主义的立场，起来声讨蒋介石这种罪恶举动，对于蒙受蒋介石所制造的黄灾的人民，予以援手。我们要求联总对于此事应有所表示。联总来到中国，应为中国人民谋利，但你们每次都参加协议，却不督促蒋介石实行协议，实际上尽了帮助蒋介石欺骗中国人民、蒙蔽世界舆论的作用。蒋介石违背解放区人民的意志，实行堵口放水，用的是你们的机器、工具和技术人材，如果黄灾的牺牲者将你们认为蒋介石的帮凶，你们又何以自解？现在我区黄河下游人民的生命财产，已经处于万分危急的灾难之中，是你们说话的时候了。
    我冀鲁豫人民及干部半年来一方面抵抗蒋介石军事进攻，同时在工料奇缺，蒋机不断扫射轰炸，群众食居无依的条件下，进行抢险复堤，获得重大成绩，受到边府通令表扬。现在他们应当紧急动员起来，组织起来与黄灾搏斗，开展群众性的自救运动。河床居民要即刻迁移。要有组织地抢险修堤，保护堤坝，赶造并修补船只。要用自己的力量来消灭灾难，要继续半年来自卫战争及治河工作的精神，更加努力进行自救工作。冀鲁豫的父老兄弟们，你们绝不是孤立的。全区各地人民都在密切注视你们今天的灾难，赞扬并学习你们英勇的斗争。全区人民的心，都和你们在一起，你们的痛苦，就是大家的痛苦，你们的胜利，就是大家的胜利。过去各地对你们曾有过声援，今后应当更有力地展开这一声援运动。有八年抗战及一年自卫战争的经验，有全区人民作后盾，你们必能战胜黄灾。
    九年前蒋介石在豫皖苏等地造成一个灾区，使六百万人民流离失所或惨遭牺牲。现在蒋介石又要制造一个新灾区（即故道），他还无耻宣传说是为了旧灾区（即新泛区）人民的利益。他为什么要独厚于旧灾区人民，难道蒋管区不是到处灾区十空人民无法生活下去么？旧灾区、新灾区、全中国人民的灾难都是蒋介石所造成的，他是灾难的总根源。不取消他的反动统治，冀鲁豫沿河人民，整个解放区人民以及全中国人民都是活不下去的。我沿河人民及全区人民一方面抢救黄灾，同时要更加奋勇进行爱国自卫战争，歼灭更多蒋军，为结束蒋介石灾难的统治而奋斗。
