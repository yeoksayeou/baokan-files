    Post Office Headquarters Production Earns 40,000 Silver Dollars in One Month
    [Our Newspaper] The postal agencies' production has achieved remarkable results in all groups. The entire agency, with less than twenty people, has earned more than 45,050 yuan in a single month.
    Flour Milling Group: Li Qiyan and five others milled a total of 750 jin of wheat and 100 jin of corn from February 8th to March 15th, earning wages of 17,540 yuan. The barber group of two people contracted for haircuts at the × agency, charging 50 yuan per person each time. They also opened a barbershop. Not only do local residents often come to get haircuts and shaves, but even passing villagers often detour to get their hair cut. In one month, they earned a profit of 6,110 yuan. The number of people spinning cotton has increased from three to twelve. The busy Director-General Su, who had just returned from Taihang, quickly organized his light and fast Yan'an-style special spinning wheel, preparing to spin yarn. The earliest three people spun a total of six jin and twelve liang of thread. A diligent seventeen-year-old orderly, Comrade Han Lisheng, spun two jin and ten liang in half a month. Sometimes he moved his wheel to the room of the women's association chairman's weaving mutual aid group to spin, initially just to learn from them, but soon he proposed a competition.
    The families of the entire bureau have also joined the production upsurge. Comrade Shi Yuying spun a total of fourteen jin in twenty-two days, earning 7,000 yuan, enough to cover her own living expenses. Her highest daily record was twelve liang. Comrade Wang Meirong is not lagging behind either, having spun five jin in one month and put it on a power loom. Now she has woven four-fifths of it. (Chen Bin)

    邮政总局生产一月赚洋四万
    【本报讯】邮政机关生产，各组都已获得显著成绩，全机关不到二十人一月多已得到四万五千零五十元。
    磨面组：李启艳等六人，自二月八日到三月十五日，共磨麦子七百五十斤，玉茭一百斤，得工资一万七千五百四十元。理发组二人，包了×机关之理发，每人一次五十元，并开理发铺，不但驻地老百姓常来剃头刮脸，连过路老乡也常绕路来理发，一个月即得利六千一百一十元。纺花的由三人增加到十二人。百忙的苏总局长才从太行回来，就赶紧整理他那辆轻快的延安式特号大纺车，准备纺纱；最早的三人共纺出了六斤十二两线，一个十七岁的勤务员韩力生同志，半月即纺了二斤十两，有时他搬着车子到妇会主席领导的纺织互助组的屋里纺，起初只是为了便于向人家学习，很快他就向人家提出比赛了。
    全局的家属也都卷入生产热潮，石玉英同志二十二天共纺十四斤，得洋七千元，解决自己生活还有余，她每日最高纪录是十二两，王美蓉同志也不落后，在一月中纺了五斤，上了机织布，现在已织起五分之四。（陈彬）
