　　The Fourth District of Yanggu, in resolutely implementing land reform, combated landlords and resolved the problem of factional contradictions among cadres. As early as 1942, when enemy and puppet strongholds were numerous, the district carried out a concealed struggle against corruption and the investigation of black land. After the enemy withdrew in 1944, an anti-traitor and anti-local tyrant movement was launched for a time, and the arrogance of feudal forces was temporarily concealed. The landlords were very vigilant and reduced their targets by means of false pawns and false sales. When the district cadres first accepted the land reform policy, they all believed that the old district had fought several times and there was nothing left to fight. Furthermore, due to the opposition of "large groups" and "small groups" (i.e., poor peasant groups) in the peasant association caused by the past anti-"new aristocrats" and anti-"old organizations," the hidden landlords took the opportunity to collude with the "anti'd" old cadres and the excluded middle peasants, causing the poor peasants to panic and waver due to isolation. The "anti'd" old cadres complained about their superiors, the new cadres worried that they would be "anti'd" in the future, and the district cadres were in a dilemma and unable to start. At the beginning of this land reform, a meeting of 1,500 active peasant elements was first convened, clearly proposing to eliminate feudal exploitation and return the land to the farmers; to unite the middle peasants and organize all the farmers. The leadership also expressed its determination to implement the policy and support those who were entitled to it. The next day, with the sound of gongs and drums, all the participants paraded in a column, and at the Qiji Fair, they complained on the spot and shot the special agent Jin Baotai who assassinated the chairman of the peasant association. The masses said, "It would have been good to do this earlier!" After the activists returned to their villages, 46 villages (out of 71 villages in the district) launched struggles against the landlords. Within half a month, the farmers recovered 3,034 mu of land, 121,185 jin of grain, 54 carts, 61 livestock, 20 buildings, and 239 houses. In the movement, the contradictions between cadres and the masses were quickly eliminated, and the peasant organization was unprecedentedly expanded. The district newly developed 1,603 members of the peasant association, 1,511 members of the women's association, 346 sisters' groups, and 873 children, and the peasant's mood was unprecedentedly high.

　　阳谷四区土地改革中
    三千余亩土地归农
    【本报阳谷讯】四区以坚决贯彻土地改革斗倒地主，解决了干部宗派矛盾问题。该区远在一九四二年敌伪据点林立时就进行过隐蔽的反贪污查黑地斗争。四四年敌人撤走后，曾一度开展反奸、反恶霸运动，封建势力的气焰暂时隐蔽，地主很警觉地以假当、假卖等办法缩小目标。区干部接受土地改革方针之初，都认为老区斗争了几次，没斗头了。又因过去反“新贵”、反“老组织”中造成农会中“大团体”、“小团体”（即贫农组）的对立，隐蔽地主乘机勾引被“反”的老干部与被排斥的中农，使贫农因孤立而恐慌动摇。被反的老干部埋怨上级，新干部担心将来会被“反”，区干部则进退维谷，无法下手。这次土地改革开始，首先召开一千五百积极分子农民会议，明确提出消灭封建剥削，土地还家；团结中农，组织全体农民。领导上又表示坚决贯彻政策，撑腰到的。次日锣鼓喧天，全体与会者列队游行，至七级集时，当场诉苦，枪毙了暗杀农会长的特务金保太，群众说：“早这样办就好啦！”积极分子回到各村后，四十六村（全区七十一村）此起彼应展开对地主的斗争，半月内农民收回土地三千零三十四亩，粮十二万一千一百八十五斤，车五十四辆，牲口六十一头，楼房二十座，平房二百三十九间。运动中，干部群众间的矛盾迅速消除，农民组织空前扩大，全区新发展农会员一千六百零三人，妇会一千五百十一人，姐妹团三百四十六人，儿童八百七十三人，农民情绪空前高涨。
