　　Remembering Ma Linshan, Hero of the Taiyue Column

　　Last October, among the Kuomintang soldiers liberated in the Guanque battle of Linfen, a large number joined the People's Liberation Army a month later, seeking revenge for their bloody grievances. In the battles of the past half-year, many combat heroes have emerged. One of them, Ma Linshan, was still a sixteen-year-old child soldier when he was liberated. After arriving in the liberated area, he was warmly welcomed by the people and the Eighth Route Army. In particular, after a denunciation meeting, his class consciousness was immediately raised. In the second month after he joined the Eighth Route Army, he created amazing achievements in the Lvliang battle, winning the title of People's Hero at the People's Hero Conference of the entire column for capturing one mountain gun and two mortars.

　　This sixteen-year-old child soldier still had a lot of childishness when he was liberated, and he was so afraid that he almost cried. He had heard people say that the Eighth Route Army would use machine guns to "call the roll" of prisoners. But after arriving at his destination, the kind people welcomed them in droves, bringing fruits, pastries, and meat, which was completely different from what he had heard before. After studying at the Liberated Soldiers Brigade, he was shocked at a denunciation meeting as everyone poured out their grievances. With so many suffering people and such great hatred, he was no longer afraid of overthrowing old Jiang. He poured out his own bitterness in one breath—begging for food since childhood, his father starved to death, and he was twice sold by his mother to wealthy families as a slave for the sake of survival. Later, he was captured and forced into Chiang Kai-shek's army, where he was beaten and scolded. In the Eighth Route Army, everyone took care of him like a relative, which made him feel uneasy; even his parents had never been so kind to him for the sake of his own life.

　　During the Lvliang campaign, he saw that the veteran comrades always brought back prisoners and weapons, and he thought, "I also want to make contributions." On January 8th, in the Xiaoyi battle, the Second Company received the order to pursue the enemy. He immediately ran at the forefront of the Second Company. He said, "At that time, the enemy was running around in confusion after being hit by our shells. I saw an enemy pulling a beast of burden and tried my best to catch him, but I was too short and my legs were too short to catch up. Then I saw someone climbing up the slope and I shouted: 'Surrender!' He said, 'No gun,' and handed over a rice container. I said: 'The Eighth Route Army doesn't want your things.' and took him prisoner. Then came another animal carrying a mountain gun. I was so happy at this time that I didn't care about the previous prisoner and hurried to catch up with the animal. People saw that I was small and ignored me, so I twisted a grenade and shouted: 'Where are you going, surrender!' I don't know who fired a bullet that happened to knock the animal down. At this time, the squad leader was also shouting behind me to cheer me on: 'Ma Linshan, don't let them run away.' I became bolder and ordered the prisoners to 'Crawl down!' They all crawled down. I saw more enemies behind them, a tall man carrying a rifle on his back. I rushed out and shouted 'Surrender!' He quickly raised his hands and said, 'I surrender, I surrender.' Not long after, an old man came over, also carrying a gun, but he suddenly crawled behind me, looking like he was going to shoot. At this time, I ran a few steps closer to him and said, 'Surrender!' Before he could push the bullet, I snatched the gun. I went back to the middle of the prisoner artillerymen, and just as I squatted down, the enemy brought over two mortars. I jumped out again and said, 'Surrender!' One person said, 'No gun,' and I said, 'Crawl down!' I grabbed the reins, and a prisoner said, 'Kid, you can't hold it, I'll hold it for you.' At this time, bullets were flying everywhere, and I said, 'Don't move! Crawl down, call our bullets!' They really crawled down. I hadn't hidden myself yet when three more people came over carrying a machine gun. I waved a grenade and shouted loudly: 'Surrender!' That guy was about to turn the muzzle to shoot me; I thought about throwing a grenade, but it was too close. I was afraid of hurting myself, so I put the grenade down, rushed up, and bayoneted one down. The other two hurriedly said, 'Don't fight, don't fight.' I told them all to crawl down and take out the bullets. When it was almost dark, my squad and I handed over seventy prisoners and mountain guns and machine guns to the regimental headquarters. As soon as the company commander saw me, he affectionately took my hand: 'Linshan, you are really good, you are our hero!'"

　　过去是人民的仇敌今日是人民的功臣
    记太岳纵队英雄马林山
    芦＠
    去年十月，临汾官雀战斗中被解放的蒋军士兵，一个月以后，大批的参加了人民解放军，报自己的血海深仇。在半年来的战斗中，涌现了许多战斗英雄。其中之一的马林山，被解放时还是一个十六岁的娃娃兵，他到了解放区后，受到了老百姓和八路军的热烈欢迎，特别是经过一次控诉会后，立刻提高了自己的阶级觉悟。在他参加了八路军后的第二个月，吕梁战斗中创立了惊人的功绩。以缴获一门山炮两门迫击炮的成绩，在全纵队的人民功臣大会上被选为人民功臣。
    这位十六岁的娃娃兵在被解放时，还有着很大的孩子气，他害怕的几乎哭出来，他过去听人家说，八路军对俘虏要用机关枪“点名”。但是到了目的地以后，善良的老百姓成群结队的欢迎他们，送来了水果、点心和肉，与以前听说的完全不同。到了解放大队学习，在一次控诉大会上，大家倾倒出自己的苦水，使他大吃一惊。有这么多的苦人，有这么大的仇恨，还怕弄不倒老蒋。他一口气诉完了自己的苦处——从小讨饭，父亲饿死了，他两次被母亲为了生活卖给老财家当奴才。以后又被抓到蒋介石队伍里当兵，挨打受骂。到了八路军里，人人像亲人似的照顾他，心里倒难受起来，就是父母为了自己生活，也没这样亲过。
    吕梁作战中，他看见老同志们每回都抓回俘虏，拿回武器，他想“我也要立功劳”。一月八日孝义战斗，二连得到追击敌人的命令，他立即跑在二连的最前面，他说：“那时敌人被我们的炮弹打得乱跑乱碰，我看着一个敌人拉着一头牲口，就用尽力量去抓，可是个子小腿短，赶不上人家，又看见坡上爬着一个人，我喊：‘缴枪’！他说‘没枪’，就递过一饭筒来。我说：‘八路军不要你的东西’。就把他俘虏了。那边又来了一个牲口，驮着一门山炮，这时我可高兴了，对先前那个俘虏也不管了，急忙追上牲口。人家见我小，不理会，我扭起炸弹喊着：‘还往那里走，缴枪’！不知道是谁打来一颗子弹恰好把牲口打倒了。这时班长也在后边喊，给我助威：‘马林山，不要叫他们跑了’。我胆大了，命令俘虏们‘给我爬下’。他们都爬下了。我看见后边还有敌人，一个大个子背着一支步枪，我猛的跑出去叫‘缴枪’！他听了赶快举起手来说：‘我缴枪，我缴枪’。不大一会，又过来一个老汉，也扛着一支枪，但他忽然爬在后边，要开枪的样子，这时我就紧跑几步到他跟前说：‘缴枪’！他还没有推上子弹，我就把枪夺过来，我又回到俘虏炮兵中间，刚蹲下，敌人驮过来两门迫击炮，我又跳出去说：‘缴枪’！有一个人说：‘没枪’，我说：‘都爬下’！顺手拉过马缰绳，一个俘虏说：‘小孩儿，你拉不住，我给你拉。’这时候子弹乱飞，我说：‘不要动！爬下，招呼我们的子弹’！他们真的爬下了，我还没藏好，又过来三个人，扛着一挺机枪。我用炸弹一晃大声叫：‘缴枪’！那个家伙要扭转枪口来打我；我想打出手榴弹去，太近了。怕伤了自己，就把手榴弹一放，冲上去，一刺刀刺倒了一个，那两个忙说：‘不打了，不打了。’我叫他们都爬下，把子弹拿掉了。快天黑时候，我和班里人把七十来个俘虏和山炮机枪一齐交到团部。连长一见，亲势的拉着我的手：‘林山，你真好呀，你是我们的英雄！’”
