　　Women Peasants Unite to Investigate Landlords' Hidden Property
　　Pengcheng Women Actively Participate in the Struggle for Emancipation
　　[Report from Cixian by Our Newspaper] After cadres and activists from Pengcheng District and villages convened meetings to examine their past underestimation of women's work, which allowed landlords to exploit loopholes, the women's movement in the entire district has greatly developed. Women in Sanhe Village actively and resolutely aired their grievances and vented their anger in the joint struggle in Pengcheng Township, just like the men. After the meeting, Pengcheng Township also convened a meeting of women activists, attended by more than 100 people, who exchanged experiences with each other. Liu Meizhen said: "My method of uniting women is to find the most oppressed women, start by pointing out that women are not treated as human beings, and then mobilize them to participate in the struggle." Zhang Xiulan from Sanhe Village said: "I am the most abused at home. When I united people, I looked for those who were as oppressed as I was, and I united nine people in one day." Finally, everyone was guided to pour out their bitterness. In the process of pouring out their bitterness, everyone recalled their lives of being treated like beasts of burden. As they spoke, they cried, and their determination to struggle against the landlords became even firmer. Everyone unanimously decided to unite all the suffering women, to mobilize women not to hide belongings for the landlords, and to investigate where the landlords' guns, documents, etc., were hidden through women. They resolved to unite with the peasants and overthrow the landlords. After the meeting, women's enthusiasm was high, and they quickly organized more than 600 women, and uncovered a large number of hidden belongings and grain belonging to the landlords.

　　妇女农民团结一心清查地主隐蔽财物
    彭城妇女积极参加翻身斗争
    【本报磁县讯】彭城区区村干部积极分子，经过集会检讨对妇女工作的轻视观点，因而给地主留下空子的教训后，全区妇女运动有很大开展。三合村妇女在参加彭城镇的联合斗争中诉苦出气，与男子一样的积极坚决。会后彭城镇并召开了妇女积极分子会议，到会的一百多人，相互交流了经验。刘美珍说：“我串通妇女的办法是找最受压迫的妇女，从不把女人当人扯起，动员她参加斗争。三合村张秀兰说：“我在家最受气，我串通时就找和我一样受压迫的人，一天就串通了九个。”最后又引导大家诉苦，诉苦中大家都回忆到自己过的牛马生活，一面说，一边哭，对地主斗争的决心更坚决了。大家一致决议要把所有受痛苦的妇女都串连起来，要动员妇女不给地主藏包袱，要通过妇女调查出地主的枪支文书等放在那里。要和农民团结一心把地主打垮。会后妇女情绪高涨，很快就组织起六百多妇女，并查出了地主隐蔽的包袱粮食等甚多。
