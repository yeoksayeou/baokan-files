　　How to Activate the "Backward"?
　　"Backward peasants and feudal remnants were discovered simultaneously after repeated reviews." This is an experience put forward by the Taihang Third Sub-district in summarizing the winter rectification movement. This experience shows that without the awakening and mobilization of all peasants, it is impossible to eliminate the exploitation and rule of feudal landlords. Many examples have also been found in the land reform reviews in various regions to prove this point. For example, in Chengguan, Wu'an, after two major mobilizations, it was discovered during a review that the wives and brothers of militiamen and activists were not of one mind with them, and secretly returned the distributed items to the landlords. In Nantianhe, Changzhi, statistics after two major mobilizations showed that only 79 peasants were awakened, 53 were middle-of-the-roaders (those who followed along), 62 were backward elements, and unawakened peasants dared not divide anything. It is a common phenomenon for backward peasants to act as "air raid shelters" for landlords. In Nanweiquan Village, Licheng, it was finally discovered that over 100 households were hiding things for the landlords, and even some cadres were involved... Because landlords had backward peasants as cover, they were unwilling to sincerely bow their heads, thinking that "the struggle is just a passing fad." Some people sympathized with them, thinking that "the struggle is extortion." Given the opportunity, they spread rumors to confuse the public and plot counterattacks. Facts have proven that only when the backward masses truly awaken and create a mass movement to isolate the landlords can the landlords' hidden wealth and land be brought out, allowing poor peasants to truly turn over. Therefore, the Taihang Third Sub-district's statement that "mobilizing the backward and uniting all peasants is the key to thoroughly eliminating feudalism" is very correct.
　　We have long understood that any movement with a mass scale inevitably has three parts: active, backward, and intermediate. This rule is no exception in the land reform movement. However, how the leadership seriously mobilizes the backward has become an important issue in the current land reform review stage. In this regard, many counties in Taihang have created many experiences. Based on my personal understanding, I put forward the following points:
　　First, break through the cadres' thinking and remove obstacles to mobilizing the backward: After a major mobilization, cadres are generally prone to the following thoughts and situations: First, complacency and believing that everything is fine. Second, looking down on backward masses, thinking that they are "dead dogs that can't be propped up against a wall, and they deserve to live without turning over," which is a non-class ideology. Third, some may be corrupted and bought by landlords. Fourth, corruption or unfair distribution of fruits causing mass dissatisfaction. Faced with this situation, to seriously mobilize the backward and implement land reform, the leadership must first make a decision, conduct thorough investigations over and over again, and use concrete facts to persuade cadres with complacency. For cadres and activists who have been bought by landlords, patiently enlighten them again and mobilize them to mobilize the backward together. In Tianhe Village, Changzhi, among more than 50 cadres and activists, eight were bought by the landlord's money, four ate the landlord's ramen, ten pitied the landlord, and eight were bought by the landlord's honey trap. After education, their awakening was very rapid, and they were a very valuable force in continuing to mobilize the backward and resolutely fight against the landlords. Cadres who have unfairly distributed fruits should also be persuaded to withdraw automatically. In short, except for some villages where the cadres are controlled by the landlords, and bad cadres should be resolutely replaced from the mobilization of the masses, in general, we must first start with resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses and unite them to mobilize the backward. Otherwise, even if the backward masses are mobilized, if they are not in harmony with them, it is easiest to form sectarian divisions and increase work difficulties.
　　Second, a large part of the backward masses are desperately poor, hired laborers, and sheep laborers, etc. They suffered the most in feudal society, and the leadership did not pay enough attention to them. Therefore, they do not believe that they can still turn over. Generally speaking, they have the following concerns: First, they do not understand whether turning over is right or wrong, and are still governed by conscience and fate. Some come to the conclusion that: "Turning over is reasonable (the poor should turn over), and it is also unreasonable (it is right to rent out and charge interest)." Second, they lack confidence: "No one looks up to us." "Aren't the cadres still on the side of the landlords in secret?" "We have suffered for half our lives, suffering is our fate"... Third, they are afraid of a change in the political climate. To mobilize them to turn over, we must first encourage them to speak out about their sufferings. We must overcome the idea that it is unnecessary to always speak out about suffering because the suffering has already been voiced. If the suffering is voiced thoroughly and the root of poverty is found, they will naturally awaken. In many places, the "air raid shelters" of the landlords were discovered from speaking out about suffering. The Yushi's approach is called "speak out the suffering thoroughly, vent all the anger." Adopting such a policy is extremely important in this stage of mobilizing the backward. From speaking out about suffering, they will naturally understand the principle of "turning over should be done." Second, cadres should support and take charge, showing their determination to support them in turning over, and review their past mistakes. This will easily increase their confidence. Third, use the method of comparing forces to explain that a change in the political climate is not terrible and impossible. Finally, special attention should be paid to patiently working hard. Changzhi's approach is called "doing cold work"; a cadre spent three days grazing sheep with a sheep laborer, patiently guiding him to success. The previous report in this newspaper, "How to mobilize the backward in the stable?" also shows this characteristic.
　　Third, is it necessary to unite with the middle peasants in mobilizing the backward? A part of the middle peasants are backward masses, and they feel even more frightened in the continued review. Some will automatically offer their land. If this situation is not paid attention to and allowed to develop, it is likely to form internal chaos among the peasants, while ignoring the thorough liquidation of the landlords. Moreover, some of the middle peasants are also air raid shelters for the landlords, and it is difficult to finally isolate the landlords without mobilizing them. Therefore, it should be affirmed that it is necessary to unite with the middle peasants in mobilizing the backward, that is, to continue to implement the policy of mobilizing the poor and hired laborers to unite with the middle peasants. The specific method is mainly to let the middle and poor peasants realize the principle that peasants all over the world are one family through speaking out about suffering. The Ping Shun peasants' experience of realizing the principle that "poor peasants are the bones, middle peasants are the meat, and landlords are the wolves" from speaking out about suffering is a great success; an important experience here is that when poor and backward peasants have thoroughly voiced their suffering, it is easy to get the "sympathy of the same disease" from the middle peasants, and the poor, hired, and middle peasants will naturally join hands to turn their target to the landlords.

### 怎样发动“落后”？

　　怎样发动“落后”？
    “落后农民与封建尾巴，是在反复检查后，才同时被发现。”这是太行三分区在总结冬季填补运动时提出的一条经验。这条经验说明了没有全体农民的觉悟与发动，消灭封建地主的剥削统治是不可能的。各地翻身大检查中也均发现不少事例证明这一点。例如武安城关经过两次大动，但经过检查在民兵、积极分子中，竟发现他们的老婆兄弟和自己不一心，偷偷还把分的东西送还地主。长治南天河经过两次大动后的统计：觉悟了的农民只七十九人，中间分子（跟着跑的）五十三人，落后分子六十二人，未觉悟的农民不敢分东西。落后农民给地主做“防空洞”是普遍现象。黎城南委泉一村，最后查出给地主藏东西的有一百多家，甚至还有干部在内……地主因有落后农民做掩护，便不肯真心低头，他觉得“斗争是一阵风。”“有人”同情他，“斗争是讹人的。”一有机会，便谣言惑众，阴谋反攻。事实证明，只有落后群众真正觉悟起来，造成群众性的孤立地主运动，才能把地主千方百计隐蔽的财物、土地拿出来，使贫苦农民得以真正翻身。因此太行三分区提出“发动落后，团结全体农民，是彻底消灭封建的关键”是很对的。
    我们都早已懂得：任何一个具有群众性规模的运动，必然有积极、落后、中间三个部分，这个规律在土地改革运动中毫不例外。但领导上如何认真发动落后的问题，则已成为目前土地改革复查阶段的重要课题了。在这方面，太行很多县份创造了许多经验，仅据我个人认识到的，提出以下几点：
    第一、打通干部思想，解除发动落后的障碍：大动过后干部一般的易产生以下几种思想与情况：一是自满居功认为百事大吉，没问题了。二是看不起落后群众，觉得他们是“死狗扶不上墙，不翻身也活该”的非阶级思想。三是有些可能被地主腐化收买。四是贪污或多分果实群众不满。面对这种情况，要想认真发动落后贯彻土地改革，就必须领导上先下决心，三番五次，深入调查，用具体事实，说服干部居功自满思想。对于已被地主收买的干部积极分子要耐心的再次启发他们觉悟，动员他们一道去发动落后。长治天河村五十多个干部积极分子中有八个被地主金钱收买、有四个吃了地主的拉面、十个可怜地主、八个被地主用美人计收买。经教育后，他们的觉悟是很快的，他们在继续发动落后与坚决与地主斗争上，是很可贵的力量。对于多分果实的干部也要说服他自动退出。总之除有些村是干部被地主把持，应坚决从发动群众中撤换坏干部外，一般的都要先从解决干群关系入手，团结他们一道发动落后，否则即使落后群众发动起来了，但与他们不谐调，最易形成宗派分裂，增加工作困难。
    第二、落后群众中有很大一部分是赤贫、雇工、羊工等，他们是在封建社会里受痛苦最深，同时领导上对他们也注意不够，因此他们不相信自己还能翻身。一般的说，他们有以下几种思想顾虑；一是懂不清翻身究竟对不对，还受良心命运的支配，有的就得出这样的结论：“翻身也合理（穷人该翻身），也不合理（出租出利理应该）”。二是没信心：“没人看起咱。”“干部暗里还不是和地主一心？”“苦了半辈子了，苦是命苦”……。三是怕变天。针对这些思想情况要发动他们翻身。第一是启发诉苦，必须克服那种诉苦已过不必老是诉的想法，苦诉透了，穷根找到了，他们自然会觉悟起来，有好多地方都是从诉苦中才发现了地主“防空洞”的。榆社的提法叫“诉透苦、出尽气。”在发动落后这一段采取这样的方针极为重要，从诉苦里他会自然明白“翻身应该”的道理。二是干部撑腰作主表明扶植他们翻身的决心，并检讨自己过去的错误，这样就很容易提高他们的信心。三是用对比力量的办法说明变天不可怕也不可能。最后还需特别注意的是要耐心下苦工，长治的提法叫“下冷工”；一个干部为了发动一个羊工，跟他一起放了三天羊，耐心诱导才得到成功。本报前曾发表过“马厩如何发动落后？”也正表明了这个特点。
    第三是发动落后中是否还要团结中农的问题：中农有一部分是落后群众，继续开展复查中他们更感到恐惧，有的就要自动献田。如不加以注意，任此种情况发展下去，很可能形成农民内部的混乱，而忽视了对地主的彻底清算，而且中农中也有些是地主的防空洞，不发动他们起来就很难最后孤立地主。因此应该肯定，发动落后中要团结中农，也就是仍要贯彻发动贫雇团结中农的方针。具体办法主要是经过诉苦，让中贫农认识天下农民是一家的道理。平顺农民从诉苦中体会到“贫农是骨头，中农是肉，地主是狼”的道理，就是很大的成功；这里一个重要的经验是，当贫苦落后农民诉透痛苦后，很容易得到中农的“同病相怜”，贫雇中农也就自然携起手来把目标转向地主。
