Military Region Supply Department Clothing Factories
    Launch Production Competition
    [Reported by this paper] The First Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department has launched a production competition throughout the factory. Comrades in the dyeing workshop get up and go to work in the middle of the night, and comrades in the tailoring workshop don't leave work until midnight. Repairman Zhang Deshun said, "I'll repair small machine problems as soon as they occur, and guarantee to fix major problems in three days." Comrade Chen Jinshun continued to work despite having sores on his leg, and Comrade Liu Milu persisted in working despite having sore eyes. Comrade Hu Xiaoliu had wanted to ask for leave to go home, but after the competition started, he didn't go home. The entire factory is working hard to increase production and contribute to the people. (Ge Qin)
    [Another report] The Second Clothing Factory, all employees have launched a wave of meritorious service through production. In terms of output, they proposed "Dyers do not delay tailors, tailors do not delay machinists, and machinists complete tasks on time"; in terms of quality, it is "Not a single bad piece of clothing will be sent to the front." The first batch of tasks has been successfully completed. In terms of quality, they generally achieve accurate sizes, consistent colors, uniform stitching, and save raw materials (scrap cloth does not exceed three square inches in size). Groups one and nine automatically worked overtime for three or four hours because the machines malfunctioned, and even exceeded their tasks. Repair team leader Comrade Tian Fushan worked while sick to ensure that all the factory's ×× machines were running, and has not rested for a month. He also made his own files to overcome the shortage of tools. Comrade Yang Shuli of the Administrative Office pushed tofu himself, cook Yang Mingji steamed buns with ash water (used instead of caustic soda), and all cadres worked day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep. They also launched a revolutionary competition to contribute to the cause with the first and third factories, and the movement is on the rise. (Jiao Feng)
    [Another report] The Third Clothing Factory, the entire staff and workers' congress passed a resolution to propose a friendly competition with the first and second factories. The conditions are: 1. Large quantity: Exceed the production standard and complete the production task ahead of schedule. 2. Good quality: No bad cloth is dyed, colors are consistent, sizes and styles are in accordance with regulations, the stitching is dense and uniform, and it is guaranteed that not a single bad piece of clothing is sent to the front. 3. Few leaves: Not only take care of yourself, but also take care of the work. Take less leave for things that matter, and don't take leave for small matters. 4. Good unity: Help others, take care of the overall situation, do not be conservative in technology, learn with humility, and teach people with patience. 5. Save raw materials: Improve technology, promote innovation, and save labor and raw materials. It was also proposed to summarize by "May Day" and ask the Political Department of the Supply Department to judge.

    军区供给部各被服厂
    展开生产竞赛
    【本报讯】军区供给部第一被服厂，全厂展开生产竞赛，染坊同志半夜即起床上工，裁剪房到半夜才下工。修机工人张德顺说：“机子发生小毛病，随到随修，发生大毛病，保证三天修好。”工人陈金顺同志腿上生了疮也不休息，刘米路同志眼疼仍坚持工作，胡小六同志早想请假回家，竞赛后也不回家了。全厂一致努力增产为民立功。（葛钦）
    【又讯】第二被服厂，全体职工掀起生产立功浪潮。产量上提出“染工不误裁工，裁工不误机工，机工按时完成任务”；在质量上是“不往前方送一件坏衣服。”第一批任务已胜利完成，质量上一般做到尺码准确颜色一致，针线均匀，节省原料（碎布不超过三方寸大）。一组、九组因机器发生了故障，就自动加工三四个钟头，并还超过了任务。修机组长田福山同志为保证全厂开动××架机子而带病工作，一月来没有休息一天，并且自己打锉刀克服工具缺乏的困难。事务处杨述立同志自己推豆腐，炊事员杨明吉同志淋灰水（代火碱用）蒸馒头，全体干部废寝误餐昼夜工作，并向一、三厂提出了革命的竞赛献工立功运动，正日趋高涨。（焦风）
    【又讯】第三被服厂，全体职工大会通过，向第一、二厂提出友谊竞赛，条件为：一、数量多，超过生产标准量，提前完成生产任务。二、质量好：不染坏布、配色一致、尺码样式按照规定、针线稠密均匀、保证不送一件坏衣服到前方。三、请假少：不仅照顾自己、更要照顾工作。有事少请假、事小不请假。四、团结好：帮助别人、照顾整体、技术上不保守、虚心学习、耐心教人。五、省原料：提高技术发扬创造，节省力量原料。并提出到“五一”总结，请供给部政治部评判。
