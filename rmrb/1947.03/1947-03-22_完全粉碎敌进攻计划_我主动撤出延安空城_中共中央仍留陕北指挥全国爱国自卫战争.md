Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th— The traitor Chiang Kai-shek attacked the democratic holy land of Yan'an. After the staunch resistance of our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region military and civilians, he suffered heavy casualties. On the 19th, our People's Liberation Army withdrew from Yan'an after fulfilling its mission. In this operation, our People's Liberation Army and the people of the Border Region demonstrated extraordinary bravery and enthusiasm, while Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's all-out invasion gained them nothing but an empty city. In this invasion, Chiang Kai-shek deployed three-fifths of his air force, using American-made planes to indiscriminately bomb the peaceful residents of the Border Region, and also transferred his meager parachute troops to Xi'an, preparing for a desperate gamble. On the ground, Chiang Kai-shek used nine reorganized divisions and thirteen reorganized brigades on the front line, concentrating all of Hu Zongnan's main forces, attempting to occupy Yan'an by surprise attack, annihilate our People's Liberation Army, and strike the head of the great Chinese Communist Party. This surprise attack was originally scheduled to begin on March 6th and to capture Yan'an before the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference convened on March 10th. Chiang Kai-shek's political purpose in attacking Yan'an this time was clearly to boost the morale of his extremely demoralized troops internally, and to embolden the pro-war faction within his party at the Kuomintang Third Plenary Session; internationally, it was to cooperate with the American imperialists' "big stick" policy and to help Marshall get through the difficult situation at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The strategy of our People's Liberation Army has always been not to defend one city or one place to the death, but to eliminate the enemy's effective strength. This time, the defense of Yan'an focused on disrupting its surprise attack and ensuring the safe transfer of the leading organs. Now we can announce to the world that this goal has been perfectly achieved, and Chiang Kai-shek's plan to reach Yan'an before March 10th has been thwarted. The central organs of the Chinese Communist Party are intact and remain in northern Shaanxi to guide the national patriotic self-defense war. Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of Yan'an cannot save his crisis in military, political, and economic terms. However, Chiang Kai-shek's actions will make the people of the whole country more united and make the most resolute struggle for independence, peace and democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, 20th— The Chiang troops who invaded the Guanzhong Sub-district have fallen into the inescapable net of people's guerrilla warfare. After the Chiang troops invaded Malan City, the capital of Guanzhong, on February 21st, the local military and civilians immediately launched a guerrilla war, widely attacking the enemy. On the 25th of last month, when more than 30 Chiang agents from Yaoxian went to the Liangzhai Workshop area of the Liulin District to organize Baojia, more than 10 people were killed and four were captured by the guerrillas. The Chiang troops who harassed the area from Malan to Yaoxian were also captured with 11 people in the area. On the 5th of this month, the Chishui Guerrilla Team penetrated deep behind enemy lines and attacked Tuqiao Town in Gouyi, destroying all the blockhouse fortifications in the area. On the evening of the 7th, they recovered Liangzhuang in one fell swoop, capturing 35 people including the Chiang-appointed "Self-Defense Force" captain and below, seizing three light machine guns and seventeen rifles. The vast area of Chishui has been recovered. At present, the military and civilians in various places are actively carrying out anti-"encirclement and suppression" and anti-looting struggles.

    完全粉碎敌进攻计划
    我主动撤出延安空城
    中共中央仍留陕北指挥全国爱国自卫战争
    【新华社延安二十日电】卖国贼蒋介石进攻民主圣地延安，经我陕甘宁边区军民坚强抗击，予以重大杀伤，十九日我人民解放军以任务已达，撤出延安。此次作战，我人民解放军及边区人民表示出异常的英勇与积极，而蒋介石胡宗南的竭尽全力的窜犯，除得到一个空城外毫无所获。蒋介石在此次进犯中，调了他的五分之三的空军，驾着美造的飞机对边区和平居民滥施轰炸，并且将其少得可怜的降落伞部队亦调到西安，准备孤注一掷。在地面上，蒋介石使用于第一线的部队达九个整编师，十三个整编旅，把胡宗南所有的主力都集中起来，企图以突然袭击占领延安，歼灭我人民解放军，打击伟大的中国共产党的首脑机关。这个突然袭击原定于三月六日开始，并在三月十日莫斯科外长会议开会以前攻下延安。蒋介石此次攻延安的政治目的，显然是对其内部振奋消沉已极之士气，和在国民党三中全会上替其党内主战派壮胆；在国际上则配合美国帝国主义的“大棒”政策，和使马歇尔在莫斯科外长会议上渡过难关。我人民解放军的战略向来不死守一城一地，而以消灭敌人有生力量为目的。此次保卫延安则着重于破坏其突然袭击，保证首脑机关的安全转移，现在可以宣告于世人者，就是此项目的已经完满达成，而蒋介石企图在三月十日以前窜抵延安的计划已被打破，中国共产党中央机关完好无损，并且仍留陕北指导全国的爱国自卫战争。蒋介石占领延安丝毫不能挽救其军事政治经济各方面的危机，但是蒋介石的这一行动，将使全国人民更加团结起来，为独立和平民主而作最坚决的奋斗。
    【新华社陕甘宁二十日电】侵入关中分区之蒋军，已陷入人民游击战之天罗地网中。二月二十一日，蒋军侵入关中首府马栏市后，当地军民立即展开游击战争，广泛袭击敌人。上月二十五日，耀县蒋特三十余人至柳林区梁寨坊一带编保甲时，被游击队打死十余人，俘四名。由马栏向耀县出扰蒋军，亦在该地被俘十一名。赤水游击队于本月五日深入敌后，攻入枸邑土桥镇，将该地碉堡工事全部平毁，七日晚一举收复梁庄，俘蒋记“自卫队”中队长以下三十五人，缴轻机枪三挺，步枪十七支，赤水广大地区已告收复。现各地军民正积极展开反“清剿”与反抢掠斗争。
