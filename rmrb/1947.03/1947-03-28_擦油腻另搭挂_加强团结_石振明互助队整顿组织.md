    [This report from Taiyue on the 26th] The joint mutual aid brigade of five villages, led by the old hero of Fushan, Shi Zhenming, is currently conducting "rubbing off the grease and re-hitching" to readjust its organization and improve its internal structure. For example, the Zhang Wanhe mutual aid group of Xisongshan (Shi Zhenming's basic mutual aid group) convened a "rubbing off the grease and re-hitching" meeting of team members from four small villages including Xisongshan on the evening of March 5th. Group leader Zhang Wanhe spoke first: "We've been together for a year, and there's bound to be some 'friction.' I hope everyone will bring up any opinions they have." Then, team member Wan Jianqing wanted to withdraw from the mutual aid, and Zhang Wanhe worried about not having oxen, etc. Finally, it was decided that Zhang Wanhe would be given priority for plowing, and the old hero Ji Duo would send him manure first, allowing Wan Jianqing to withdraw freely. As a result of the overall rectification, there were six full laborers, two half laborers, and ten oxen. After everyone offered each other suggestions, they were willing to be more united in organization and work harder. In addition to doing the original 495 mu from last year, they will also participate in the war effort, achieving "cultivate three, surplus one." Last year, the nine full laborers saved one work day each through mutual aid; this year, the seven full laborers will also save one work day each through mutual aid. It was decided that the mutual aid system would involve meetings every five days and account settlements every ten days.

    “擦油腻另搭挂”加强团结
    石振明互助队整顿组织
    【本报太岳二十六日电】浮山老英雄石振明领导下的范村等五村联合互助大队，最近正在进行“擦油腻另搭挂”，重新调整组织健全内部。如西松山张万合互助组（石振明基本互助组），三月五日晚，召集西松山等四个小庄队员开“擦油腻另搭挂”会议，组长张万合首先发言：“咱们在一块一年啦，不能没有一点‘磨擦’，希望大家有啥意见都提出来。”接着组员万建青要退出互助，张万合发愁没有牛等等。最后经大家决定，在变工上先给张万合犁地，老英雄冀多先给他送粪，让万建青自由退出。全组整顿结果，有全劳力六个人，半劳力两个人，和十个牛。大家经过互相提意见后，情愿在组织上更团结、做活上更努力，除做去年原来四百九十五亩外，还要参战，做到耕三余一，去年九个全劳力互助起来每天节省一个工；今年七个全劳力相互每天也要节省一个。在互助制度上决定五天一次会，十天算一次账。
