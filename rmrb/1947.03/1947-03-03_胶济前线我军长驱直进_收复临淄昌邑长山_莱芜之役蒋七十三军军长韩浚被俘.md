　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st: The three cities of Changshan, Linzi, and Changyi along the Jiaoji Railway were liberated on the 24th. Together with the previously recovered cities of Laiwu, Xintai, Yexian, Boshan, Zichuan, Zouping, Yidu, and the important towns of Zhangdian and Lan Cun, the East China People's Liberation Army has recovered ten county seats and more than a hundred important railway station towns in six days from the 18th to the 24th. From now on, the three liberated areas of Bohai, Jiaodong, and Luzhong have been connected into one.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st: Our correspondent reports on the process of annihilating over 50,000 Chiang's troops in the Laiwu Campaign, stating: After Chiang's troops invaded the liberated areas of Shandong, including Linyi, Tancheng, Laiwu, and Xintai, on the night of the 20th, the East China People's Liberation Army launched a counterattack in self-defense in Luzhong, tightly surrounding and annihilating over 50,000 Chiang's troops who had invaded the Laiyan area. By the morning of the 23rd, Li Xianzhou led the 73rd and 46th Armies, attempting to break through in two routes in the suburbs of Laiwu, but were blocked by fierce artillery fire. At around 10:00 AM on the same day, the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack, encircling them from all directions. The Chiang's troops were compressed into a bag-shaped area eight li from east to west and fifteen li from north to south, which quickly tore the dense formation of the Chiang's troops into countless fragments. The Chiang's troops completely lost their fighting spirit, lost command and communication with each other, and were completely trapped in a desperate situation, running around like rats and in complete chaos. The American-equipped 73rd Army was the first to stop resisting, with tens of thousands of officers and soldiers waving their caps, begging to surrender. On an area of about 125,000 square meters, the People's Liberation Army quickly captured tens of thousands of Chiang's troops, including their supreme commander Li Xianzhou and the commander of the 73rd Army, Han Jun, disarming the equipment of a headquarters and two armies. All kinds of guns, ammunition, supplies, and vehicles were scattered everywhere, blocking the roads. At about 4:00 PM, the battle ended victoriously.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 1st: Han Jun, the lieutenant general and commander of the Chiang's 73rd Army, which invaded the Luzhong Liberated Area, has now been confirmed to have been captured alive by the People's Liberation Army in the Laiwu operation. He was discovered on the evening of February 23rd, after the 73rd Army was annihilated, mixed among the soldiers, attempting to escape. This is the second high-ranking commander of Chiang's army captured in the Laiwu area, after Li Xianzhou.

　　胶济前线我军长驱直进
    收复临淄昌邑长山
    莱芜之役蒋七十三军军长韩浚被俘
    【新华社华东前线一日电】胶济沿线之长山、临淄、昌邑等三城于二十四日同告解放，连同前已收复之莱芜、新泰、掖县、博山、淄川、邹平、益都等城及张店、罱村等重镇，华东人民解放军于十八至二十四日六天中，已收复十个县城及重要车站市镇共百余处。自此，渤海、胶东、鲁中三个解放区已联成一片。
    【新华社华东前线一日电】本社记者报导莱芜战役歼灭蒋军五万余之经过称：蒋军侵占山东解放区临沂、郯城、莱芜、新泰等地后，二十日夜华东人民解放军在鲁中举行自卫反击，将侵入莱燕地区五万余蒋军严密包围聚歼，至二十三日晨，李仙洲率七十三、四十六两个军在莱芜城郊企图分两路突围，但为当面猛烈炮火所阻击；当日午前十时左右，人民解放军发起总攻击，四面八方包围上来，蒋军被压缩于东西八里南北十五里之袋形地区内，这就很快的把蒋军密集的队形撕裂成无数碎片；蒋军完全丧失斗志，彼此间失去指挥联络，完全陷入绝境，狼奔豕突，混乱不堪；美械化的七十三军首先停止抵抗，成千上万官兵挥舞军帽请求缴械投降。在大约十二万五千平方公尺的地面上，人民解放军很快的俘虏了数万名蒋军，其中包括他们的最高指挥官李仙洲和七十三军军长韩浚；把一个总部、两个军的装备通统解除，各种枪械弹药辎重汽车遍地皆是，途为之塞。午后四时许，战役乃胜利结束。
    【新华社华中前线一日电】进犯鲁中解放区之蒋军七十三军中将军长韩浚，现已查明于莱芜作战中被人民解放军生俘。渠系于二月二十三日晚七十三军被歼灭后，夹杂于士兵中，企图逃逸被查获者，这是继李仙洲后在莱芜地区被俘之蒋军第二个高级指挥官。
