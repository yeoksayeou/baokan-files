　　【This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 8th】 To deeply promote the thorough check of the emancipation, the Jinnan Daily again published an editorial stating: In areas or villages where land reform has not yet been thoroughly completed, we should vigorously go deep among the masses, adopt the mass line, and investigate whether feudal landlords still exist, or exist in disguised forms, in this area or village (especially backward villages)? Have the broad masses truly been mobilized? Are there still landlords intimidating and buying over unstable "activists," manipulating the masses and creating false struggles? Are there landlords preparing to temporarily flee and seek revenge? Are there still landlords secretly carrying out organized reactionary activities? ... If this is the case, resolutely mobilize the masses to thoroughly crush them. We should continue to educate the masses on practical issues, clarify class boundaries, consolidate internal unity, face backward areas, villages, and backward masses, and completely eliminate feudal exploitation. The editorial continued: After last year's emancipation movement, the class consciousness of the masses and cadres has greatly improved, and many mass leaders and outstanding cadres are working day and night with extremely high revolutionary enthusiasm for the emancipation of the working people; on the other hand, many weaknesses have also been exposed in some comrades. For example, some instruct their families or relatives to sell or disperse land; some are tempted by the petty favors of landlords and provide cover for them; some do not consider their own families' and relatives' feudal exploitation of the people and simply complain about the masses, even interfering with the mass movement; some buy cheaply or want the fruits of the masses' struggle for free; some do not distribute the fruits to the masses, but use it to do business, or curry favor with certain village cadres and activists, turning a blind eye and condoning their embezzlement, waste, misappropriation of the fruits, lining their own pockets, and excessive distribution, which seriously hinders the solution of the land problem and the unity of the peasants. In order to overcome the above-mentioned thoughts and behaviors, we should start from the upper-level organs and from ourselves, and in conjunction with the thorough check of emancipation, carry out criticism and self-criticism activities among cadres, and help the masses quickly deal with the fruit problem under the condition that we put down our burdens, promote the fair and reasonable distribution of the fruit according to the principle of filling in gaps and making up deficiencies, and realize that those who till the land have their own land.

　　冀南日报社论号召
    面向落后深入群众细致检查根绝封建
    【本报冀南八日电】为深入开展翻身大检查，冀南日报再次发表社论称：土地改革尚未彻底完成的地区或村庄，我们亟应大力深入群众，采用群众路线，调查发现这个区或这个村（尤其是落后村）是否还有封建地主存在，或变相存在？广大群众是否真正发动起来。是否还有地主威吓收买立场不稳的“积极分子”。操纵群众制造假斗争？是否有地主准备暂时远走高飞寻隙报复？是否还有地主暗地进行有组织的反动活动？…………如有此事则坚决发动群众予以彻底的粉碎。我们应当继续在实际问题上教育群众，明确阶级界线，坚固的团结内部，面向落后区村，落后群众，彻底消灭封建剥削。社论继称：经过去年的翻身运动，群众与干部的阶级觉悟大大提高了，许多群众领袖和优秀干部以极高度的革命热情为劳动人民的翻身昼夜奔忙；另一方面，在某些同志身上，也暴露很多弱点。例如有的指使自己的家庭或亲友出卖土地或分散土地；有的被地主小恩小惠所诱惑而为地主打掩护；有的不考虑自己家庭亲友对人民的封建剥削而一味的埋怨群众，甚至干涉群众运动；有的贱买或白要群众的斗争果实；有的不将果实分给群众，自己借着做买卖，或与某些村干积极分子感情拉拢，对他们贪污浪费挪用果实、中饱、多分不加劝阻，默认包庇，这都严重障碍着土地问题的解决和农民的团结。为克服上述思想和行为，应先从上层机关作起，从自己作起，结合翻身大检查，在干部中展开批评与自我批评活动，在自己放下包袱的条件下去帮助群众迅速处理果实问题，推动按填平补齐的原则公平合理的分配果实，实现耕者有其田。
