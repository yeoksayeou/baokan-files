Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: Shanghai dispatch: All circles here have risen to support Liang Renda, the martyr who died in the "February 9th" tragedy. When the grand funeral was held on the 12th, as many as thousands of people paid their respects. The nineteen principal culprits in the tragedy have been identified by the Association for Promoting the Use of National Goods and Resisting American Goods and the families of the deceased. Liang's wife, Gao Shaoli, has filed a complaint with the Kuomintang authorities, demanding that the murderers be handed over to avenge her husband. She will not bury her husband until the murderers are arrested. Fudan and other universities have organized support associations, and employees of department stores have made a large number of commemorative wreaths and sold them in department stores to solicit donations. As of the 20th, donations from all parties have reached 30 million yuan. Following the solemn appeal issued by the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Association and more than ten other organizations, the China Association for Promoting Democracy and Tan Pingshan, among others, have successively issued declarations and speeches, pointing out that the Chiang government should be held responsible for the crimes of the tragedy. In recent days, Wenhui, Lianhe, and other newspapers have published hundreds of letters from readers, including railway workers, textile factory workers, rickshaw pullers, primary school teachers, bank clerks, housewives, etc. They expressed their boundless hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries who created the tragedy and called for "settling accounts with the thugs with all our strength" and "uniting to fight the murderers." The Kuomintang authorities are doing their best to undermine support for this case from all sides. Liang Renda's memorial service was also prevented from being held, and the funeral procession was forcibly restricted. The funeral home where Liang's coffin was placed was surrounded by a large number of police for several days. In addition, thirteen employees of the national goods industry who were beaten by Chiang's secret agents have been falsely accused by the local court of "disturbing order" and are scheduled to be "summoned" within days.
