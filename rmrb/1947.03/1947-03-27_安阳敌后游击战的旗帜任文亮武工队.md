    【This Newspaper, Taihang, 25th】Anyang recently summarized the county-wide merit-making campaign over the past two months, and many heroes have emerged. The most vivid banner of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines is the Ren Wenliang Armed Work Team. This small but capable militia force is constantly active in the enemy's heartland. In the past two months, it has fought 73 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 53 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime soldiers and local despots, captured three strongholds, recovered 12 villages, established its own small guerrilla base behind enemy lines, and launched counter-liquidation campaigns in four villages. The team leader, Ren Wenliang, is extremely shrewd and has nimble intelligence. He often leads his team members to rush into enemy strongholds during the day to kill and injure the enemy. After a night raid on Linquan, upon learning the situation of the enemy in the Dongping stronghold, he disregarded his fatigue and rushed into Dongping again, chasing the enemy for three miles and inflicting casualties before turning back. Ren Wenliang not only fights the enemy bravely, but he often says, "Courage must be combined with intelligence." Last winter, when Chiang Kai-shek's army was launching a frenzied offensive against the county, Ren Wenliang was the first to respond to the call of his superiors and led the militia directly behind enemy lines, first capturing the enemy's Xiding stronghold, which shocked Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime. Xiding was surrounded by mountains with pillboxes, making it quite dangerous, but Ren Wenliang was still able to personally lead his team members to cleverly rush into the village from behind the enemy. At the same time, he mobilized the masses in nearby areas to participate in the war, setting fires everywhere in the stronghold and attacking from both inside and outside, causing the enemy to flee in panic. Under their constant attacks, Xiding was finally recovered. On one occasion, Ren Wenliang held a mass meeting near an enemy stronghold and suppressed many local despots on the spot. His methods were particularly effective in carrying out counter-liquidation work. The masses in Baoma Store were afraid to struggle under the threat of the enemy, but with the brave support of Ren Wenliang's armed work team, the village quickly began its counter-liquidation campaign. Under their unpredictable attacks, the enemy and puppet regime were extremely frightened. The enemy imagined Ren Wenliang as a tall man of six or seven feet, and some enemies said he was a battalion commander. The Ren Wenliang Armed Work Team has an excellent relationship with the masses. In the difficult guerrilla activities, they carried their own dry food, cooked meals, and delivered food. No matter how cold the weather was, they never went to the homes of the masses to warm themselves by the fire. The masses also took great care to protect them. The enemy tried to shoot Ren Wenliang in the back several times, but the masses managed to cover him up. The Ren Wenliang Armed Work Team is also very well organized. In the beginning, his militiamen were also timid. In addition to leading them to train in actual combat, Ren Wenliang always gathered good intelligence before going to a place, so that the militiamen would not suffer any losses from the enemy. There is a sound review system within the team. After each battle, a review is conducted, and there is review of discipline towards the masses, comradeship, and leadership. In addition, he pays special attention to the lives of the militiamen, ensuring that they are always physically strong. He said, "Gathering good intelligence, conducting reviews, and improving living conditions are my three experiences in leading the militia."

    安阳敌后游击战的旗帜任文亮武工队
    【本报太行二十五日电】安阳顷总结全县两月来立功运动，功臣辈出，其中最鲜艳的一面敌后游击战旗帜是任文亮武工队。此一短小精悍之民兵武装，经常活跃于敌腹心地区，两月来作战七十三次，毙伤俘蒋伪恶霸五十三名，克据点三处，收复村庄十二个，建立了自己敌后小型游击根据地，并开展了四个村的反倒算。队长任文亮极精悍，情报灵活，常常率领队员，白天冲进据点，杀伤敌人。他们夜袭林泉之次日，侦知东平据点敌情况后，不顾疲乏又冲进东平，直追敌于三里外，给以杀伤后方转回。任文亮不光和敌人斗勇，他常说：“斗勇要配合斗智”。去冬正当蒋军向该县疯狂进攻时，任文亮第一个响应上级号召，带领民兵直入敌后，首先打下敌西顶据点，震撼了蒋伪。西顶四面山头修有碉堡颇险要，任文亮仍能亲率队员，机智的从敌后面冲入村中。同时，他并动员附近群众参战，在据点里到处举火，内外夹攻，敌惊慌逃窜。在他们不断袭击下，西顶乃告光复。有一次，任文亮在敌据点附近召开群众大会，当场镇压了不少恶霸。在开展反倒算工作上，他办法尤妙：宝马店群众在敌威胁下，都不敢进行斗争，在任文亮武工队的勇敢撑腰下，该村迅即开始了反倒算。在他们神出鬼没的袭击下，敌伪异常恐惧。敌人把任文亮想像成个六七尺高的大汉，有的敌人说他是个营长。任文亮武工队与群众关系极好，在艰苦的游击活动中，他们自己背干粮、作饭、送饭，天气无论怎样冷也不乱到群众家里烤火。群众也非常爱护他们，敌人几次要打任文亮黑枪，都被群众设法掩护过去。任文亮武工队组织亦很巩固。开始，他的民兵也胆小，任文亮除率领他们在实际战斗中锻炼外，每到一地必先搞好情报，总不使民兵吃敌人丝毫亏。内部有健全的检讨制度，每次作战后必检讨，对群众纪律、同志关系、领导无不检讨。此外，他对民兵生活特别关心，务使民兵身体经常保持健壮。他说：“搞好情报，检讨，改善生活，是我带民兵的三个经验。”
