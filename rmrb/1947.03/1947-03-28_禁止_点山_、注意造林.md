    Forbid "Burning Mountains," Pay Attention to Afforestation
    To the Editor:
    In the mountains around the fourth district of Licheng, for the past ten days or so, people have been "burning mountains" (i.e., using fire to burn the weeds and grass on the mountains) every night. At night, it looks red, and during the day, it looks black. According to the masses in Zhongzhuang: burning mountains is not beneficial. Now that we have turned ourselves around, these mountains are no longer occupied by local bullies, landlords, and other "mountain kings," so we must properly build up the mountains and forests in preparation for future major construction. Now that the mountains are being burned, the fire is burning haphazardly. In the future, we won't even be able to find firewood, usable briars, etc. Therefore, I hope that this matter can attract the attention of governments in various places, and it is best to prohibit burning mountains.

    To the Editor:
    Qingming is approaching, and tree planting will soon begin. However, we have already planted dozens of trees. After reviewing this today, most of them involve digging up well-grown trees from elsewhere, roots and all, and transplanting them near our residence. This not only lacks positive significance but, on the contrary, can easily lead to the death of some transplanted trees. Of course, this phenomenon is not widespread, but my intention is that tree planting should develop into a mass movement, with everyone participating in planting. It must not be seen as solely the concern of a few organizations, schools, or troops, and even less as an elegant affair of grafting flowers and trees. At the same time, the trees planted should preferably be productive trees, followed by white poplars, willows, or pines and firs that can become timber. Only in this way can there be a positive significance for productive construction.
    Reader Li Shiming
Afforestation is a matter worthy of vigorous promotion. We believe that the opinions of comrades Fu Qun and Li Shiming are both very good. Just now we received a letter from comrade Xu Junke, a reader from Pingshun, saying that there is a phenomenon in the third district of Pingshun of cutting down productive trees (persimmon, apricot trees, etc.) to burn as firewood, which is even worse. We hope that all localities can pay attention to this.

    禁止“点山”、注意造林
    编辑同志：
    黎城四区一带大山上，近十来天，天天黑夜有人“点山”（即用火烧山上的柴草），夜间看去红又红，白天看去黑又黑。据中庄的群众反映：点山可没有好处，咱们翻了身，这些山就不再是恶霸地主等山大王所霸占的了，所以要好好建设山林，准备今后的大建设。现在点了山，火没眉没眼的乱烧，将来连烧柴、用的荆条等都没处找。所以我希望这种事情，能引起各地政府注意，最好禁止点山。

    编辑同志：
    清明快到，植树也就快开始了。不过我们已经栽了几十棵，今天检讨起来，多是把别处长得很好的种树，连根刨起，移栽到我们驻房附近，这样不但没有积极的意义，相反还易移植死一些种树。当然这种现象不多，我的意思是植树要展开群众性的运动，大家都来动手栽，决不能只看成是少数机关、学校或部队的事，更不可把它当成一种栽花接木的雅事。同时植的树，最好是生产树，其次是能成材的白杨树、柳树或松杉等，这样才能有积极的生产建设的意义。
    读者李士明植树造林是值得大力提倡的事，富群和李士明同志的意见，我们觉得都很好。刚才我们又接得平顺读者许俊科同志的信，说平顺三区有砍生产树（柿、杏树等）当柴烧的现象，那样就更不好了，希望各地都能注意起来。
