What are the ways to eat millet?
    Recently, various organizations have responded to Comrade Bo Yibo's call for production and frugality, and have reduced their consumption of white flour, eating millet more often. Millet is a good grain, but if it is made into dry rice every day, people will get tired of it after a while. If we change the way it is cooked, the food will not only not be lowered in quality, but will also be improved. Here are a few ways to make millet rice, and I hope everyone will add more:
    1. Cowpea Rice - This is the most common method, which is to mix some cowpeas into the millet, which tastes much better than pure millet rice.
    2. Mung Bean Porridge - This is to mix some mung beans into the millet porridge, which is very thick and easy to digest.
    3. Steamed Cake - Soak the millet in cold water for three hours, grind it into rice milk, add 20% of yeast and mix it, then steam it in a steamer. If you want to eat salty ones, add some salt, pepper powder, and chopped green onions to steam. If you put some red dates in it, it will become date cake.
    4. W窩頭 (Wo Wo Tou) - Grind millet and corn into flour, make them into W窩頭 and steam them. Make some vegetable soup separately, and it tastes good to eat once or twice in a while.
    5. Sesame Candy - Mash the steamed millet W窩頭, mix it with some white flour, let it cool for two or three hours, cut it into slices, and fry it in oil to make sesame candy, which is also delicious.
    6. Thin Pancake - Grind millet with some mung beans into powder, add some chopped green onions, pepper, and salt, and spread it into a thin pancake on a flat bottom, which is also delicious.
    7. Pancake - Put yeast in millet flour, let it ferment, and then spread it into a thin pancake with a griddle.
    8. Vegetable Steamed Buns - Mix millet flour with some white flour (either raw or fermented), roll it into a dough, and wrap the stir-fried vegetables in this large dough, steam it in a steamer, and cut it into small sections when eating. It tastes almost like vegetable buns.
    9. Fried Cake - Mix glutinous rice flour, wrap some bean paste or mashed persimmon paste inside, and fry it in oil.
    10. Box-Leaked Noodles - Mix millet flour with some elm bark flour and press the box-leaked noodles with a box-leaked frame, which is also delicious when mixed with vegetables.
    11. Rice Flour Bun - Grind millet into flour, sift it finely, ferment it with alkali, and make it into buns and steam it in a steamer.
    12. Combined Rice - After millet is cooked into porridge, add some white flour slices or noodles, plus oil, salt and seasonings.
    13. Two-Grain Rice - That is, mix millet and rice together to make porridge, adding some red dates, sweet potatoes or soybeans is good.
    14. Rice with Mixed Noodle Soup - That is, make a pot of boiled rice, and another pot of mixed noodles (corn, mung beans, rice, sorghum flour and some white flour are mixed into noodles, add seasonings. When eating, add some boiled rice and pour mixed noodle soup on it, which is both dry and thin, and it is also delicious.
    15. Bitter Grains - Mix rice flour and white flour, add oil, salt and seasonings, stir-fry and then steam.
    16. Fried Rice Tea - Fry the rice until cooked, grind it into flour, add some oil, salt and seasonings, and cook it into thick rice oil tea. It tastes sweet and fragrant, and is also very nutritious.
    In short, there are many ways to eat millet, but they cannot be separated from the four basic methods of "stir-frying," "steaming," "boiling," and "pancaking." As long as you always think of ways and cooperate flexibly, the variety will be endless. (Kuí)

　　小米有那些吃法？
    近来各机关响应薄一波同志生产节约的号召，差不多都减少吃白面，吃小米的时候较多了。本来小米是一种好粮食，但如每天作成干饭吃，久了就要吃腻。如果我们在作法上多换些花样，伙食不但不会降低水平，还会改善起来，兹先介绍几个小米饭的作法如下，希望大家再来补充：
    一、豇豆干饭——这是最普通的作法，即在小米中掺些豇豆，做出来比纯小米饭要好吃得多。
    二、绿豆稀饭——即在作小米稀饭时，掺进些绿豆去，吃起来很稠和，易消化。
    三、发糕——把小米用冷水浸三小时，用磨磨成米浆，放进十分之二的酵面和起来，然后用蒸笼蒸熟即成。要吃咸的，放进些盐、花椒面、葱花去蒸。如放进些红枣去，就作成枣糕了。
    四、窝窝头——把小米和玉茭都磨成面，作成窝窝头蒸出来，另作一些菜汤，偶然吃一两次也很有味。
    五、麻糖——把蒸熟的小米面窝窝头捣烂，和上些白面，凉两三小时，切成片片，用油炸成麻糖，也很好吃。
    六、饼粘——把小米渗些绿豆磨成粉，放些葱花、花椒、盐，用平底摊成薄饼粘，也好吃。
    七、煎饼——把小米面放上酵面、发酵后用熬子，摊成薄煎饼。
    八、菜蟒——把小米面渗进些白面（死面、发面都行），捍成面片，用这大块面片包卷住炒好的蔬菜，放在蒸笼里蒸熟，吃时切成一小节一小节的，吃起来，味道和菜包子差不多。
    九、油糕——把粘米面和起来，里面包点豆沙或者捣烂的柿圪塔，放到油里一煎就成。
    一○、盒漏——小米面和上些榆皮面用盒漏架子压盒漏，调上菜也好吃。
    一一、米面馍——小米磨成面，细箩箩过后，用碱发起来，做成馍放在蒸笼里蒸出就成。
    一二、合子饭——小米熬成稀饭后，渗进些白面片或面条去，加上油盐作料就成。
    一三、二米饭——即把小米和大米渗在一起作成稀饭，放进些红枣、红薯或黄豆都好。
    一四、捞饭杂面汤——即作一锅捞米饭，另作一锅杂面（玉茭、绿豆、米、高粱面和些白面捍成面条汤，放下作料。吃时加些捞饭，浇上杂面汤，有干有稀的，也很好吃。
    一五、苦粒——把米面白面拌和起来，加上油盐作料炒一炒后蒸出来即成。
    一六、炒米茶——把米炒熟后磨成面，另放些油盐作料，熬成稠稠的米油茶喝，味道又甜又香，也很营养。
    总之，小米吃法，花样虽多，离不了“炒”蒸、“煮”、“烙”四个基本作法，只要你经常想办法，灵活配合，花样就会变化无穷了。（葵）
