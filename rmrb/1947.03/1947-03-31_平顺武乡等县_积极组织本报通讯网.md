    Ping Shun, Wu Xiang and other counties
    Actively organize this newspaper's correspondent network
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Propaganda Department of the Ping Shun County Committee established a Party Newspaper Correspondent Reporting Committee in mid-March, organizing and leading 177 correspondents to write for this newspaper. The committee's task is to frequently contact this newspaper, convey this newspaper's reporting guidelines to the various correspondent groups, read, modify, or synthesize correspondents' manuscripts and provide suggestions at any time, and summarize achievements and experiences. In addition to the 22 county-level correspondents, the county's correspondents are all responsible cadres and practical workers in each district (six districts), including district heads, branch secretaries, and high school principals. Many of them are cadres of worker-peasant origin who are familiar with writing, have a lot of practical experience, and most have written manuscripts before. Some individual comrades cannot write yet, but they are all concerned about reporting. Comrade Chen Faxian, chairman of the Seventh District Women's Federation, said: "I can't write, but I can tell others to write." According to their letters, some village-level correspondent networks have now been formed, and some village chiefs, heads of farmers' associations, and teachers of people's schools have begun to write to the Party newspaper. Since March, the county has averaged two manuscripts submitted to this newspaper every day.
    [Another dispatch] The Wu Xiang County Government Organ Correspondents held a meeting on the 19th of this month to review the correspondence work. At that time, eight comrades, including Li Fang and Cheng Bu'ao, signed up to form this newspaper's correspondent group, proposing that each person write at least two articles per month. Everyone said: "It is glorious to write for the Party newspaper. We should write when it is published; we should write even more when it is not published." After the meeting, each comrade ordered a manuscript book, planning to record the submission items, the proportion of newspaper use, etc., and hold a summary meeting at the end of each month to seek progress.

    平顺武乡等县
    积极组织本报通讯网
    【本报讯】平顺县委会宣传部三月中旬成立党报通讯员报导委员会，组织领导一百七十七名通讯员为本报写稿。委员会任务为经常和本报联系，向各通讯小组传达本报报导方针，读修改或综合通讯员稿件并随时提出意见，总结成绩与经验等。该县通讯员除县级二十二名外，均为各区（六个区）负责干部及实际工作同志，包括区长、分书、和高小校长等。他们不少是组通文字的工农出身干部，有不少实际经验，大部分曾写过稿子，也有个别同志目前尚不会写，但对报导都很关心。七区妇会主席陈发先同志说：“我不会写，我告给别人写”。据他们来信说：目前更有部分村级通讯网组成，若干村长、农会主任、民校教员开始向党报写稿。三月份以来，全县平均每天有两件稿子投寄本报。
    【又讯】武乡县政府机关通讯员于本月十九日开会检讨通讯工作，当有李芳、程步鳌等八位同志报名成立本报通讯小组，提出每月每人至少写两篇稿子。大家说：“给党报写稿是光荣的，登了要写；不登更要写”。会后，各同志都订一个稿簿，计划把投稿目，报纸用稿比例等都登记上，每月底开会总结一次，以求进步。
