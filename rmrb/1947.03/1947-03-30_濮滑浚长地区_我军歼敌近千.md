From the Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) Frontline, March 29th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has been sweeping through the Kuomintang-puppet troops in the Puyang, Hua County, Jun County, and Changyuan areas since the 24th. As of the 27th, they have annihilated more than 940 enemies and recovered dozens of strongholds. The remnants of the enemy fled in a panic into the aforementioned four isolated cities. The vast countryside outside the cities has returned to the hands of the People's Liberation Army. The victories are being expanded. On the 24th, the enemy at Lao'an suffered a powerful counterattack by the People's Liberation Army and fled in panic towards Changyuan, where they were intercepted and annihilated in part, with more than 2,000 captured. On the same day, the enemy at Daguo Village fled in haste towards Changyuan, and that stronghold was recovered. On the 26th, a certain unit of our army swept through the Kuomintang-puppet troops in the Hongma Temple (south of Hua County) area, capturing more than 220 enemies and recovering strongholds such as Baidao. On the 27th, the People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to wipe out all 700-plus Kuomintang troops in Niushitun (south of Hua County).
