    Tunliu Bank Issues Three Million in Loans
    Organizes Masses to Sell Livestock
    [Report from this newspaper, Tunliu] In order to solve the difficulties with draught animals for spring plowing, Tunliu Bank issued three million yuan in livestock loans. The bank allowed the masses to go to northwestern Shanxi and Hebei to buy back livestock. The method was that the masses raised two-thirds of the capital themselves, and the bank loaned one-third, with repayment in one month. There were three types of interest rates: 1.5% per month for livestock used by the masses themselves, 3% for those who bought back livestock to sell to their own villages, and 5% for those who made livestock trading their profession. Currently, Duan Wenqi and 17 others have already bought back 37 head of cattle and 22 donkeys. Xu Hai, Shui and others are going to Handan, Hebei and other places to continue buying. Shen Zhongliang, manager of the West Street Cooperative in the city, and Xu Lichun, the village chief, are calling on the liberated peasants to raise funds themselves, with the cooperative contributing a portion, and borrowing another portion of loans to go to northwestern Shanxi to trade livestock.
