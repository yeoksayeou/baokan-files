Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 11th: Moscow dispatch: Ivanov recently wrote in Pravda that France's economic problems after the war have become the central issue of politics. Although the working class has successfully waged a production war, the country has a huge debt, large expenditures, low income, inflation, the exchange rate of the franc continues to fall, prices rise, the black market is rampant, actual wages decline, and the food supply crisis is acute. The living conditions of workers and staff are deteriorating, and mass dissatisfaction is increasing. French democrats say that the main reason for the economic crisis lies in the conspiracies and tricks of the "Two Hundred Families" (Note: This is a common name for the two hundred large banks, the most powerful group in the French bourgeoisie, like the sixty families in the United States). They still have ways to hinder government policies; French capital is originally abundant, but the "Two Hundred Families" are hindering the mobilization of their capital for reconstruction work. The General Confederation of Labor and the Communist Party firmly advocate fundamental economic reconstruction in France. They suggest mobilizing the capital of French banks, trusts, and industrialists, and using the deposits of savings banks, etc., to obtain the necessary funds, but banks and trusts, in order to pursue their political goals, prefer to freeze funds. Moreover, the danger in the French economy lies in its gradual dependence on the United States and Britain. In the first eight months of last year, France's imports from the United States exceeded its exports to the United States by 45 billion francs (imports of American goods accounted for 40% of total imports). France ranks first among employers in the United Kingdom, but ranks seventh among suppliers in the United Kingdom.

　　两百家财阀玩弄诡计
    法国经济面临危机
    苏联伊凡诺夫撰文评论
    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科讯：伊凡诺夫顷在真理报上撰文称：战后法国的经济问题，已成了政治的中心问题，工人阶级虽然成功的进行了生产战争，但国家负有庞大的债务，开支大，收入少，通货膨胀，法郎比价不断下跌，物价上涨，黑市猖狂，实际工资下降，粮食供应的危机尖锐，工人职员等生活情况更趋恶化，群众不满日见增涨。法国民主人士说：经济危机的主要原因在于“二百家”（按：系二百家大银行的通称，法国资产阶级中最有力的集团，有如美国之六十家。）的阴谋活动和诡计手腕，他们仍有阻碍政府政策的方法；法国的资金原是绰有余裕的，只是“二百家”在阻碍动员他们的资金用于复兴重建工作，总工会和共产党坚主在法国实施根本的经济重建，他们建议动员法国银行与托辣斯和工业家的资本，利用储蓄银行的存款等等以取得必须的资金，但银行和托辣斯为追求他们的政治目的起见，宁愿把资金冻结。不仅如此，法国经济上的危险还在于它逐渐地依附美国和英国。去年的前八个月，法国自美国的输入，超过对美输出四百五十亿法郎，（输入美货占总输入的百分之四十）法国在英国的顾主中占第一位，而在英国的供给者中却占第七位。
