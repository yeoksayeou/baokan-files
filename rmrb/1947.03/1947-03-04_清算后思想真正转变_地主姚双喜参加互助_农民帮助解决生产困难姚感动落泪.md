　　Ideology Genuinely Transformed After Thorough Criticism
    Landlord Yao Shuangxi Joins Mutual Aid
    Peasants Help Solve Production Difficulties, Yao Moved to Tears
    [Report from Taiyue, this paper, 1st] Yao Shuangxi, a landlord from Liushu Village, Changzi, and others who were criticized, have transformed their ideology and joined the mutual aid group, determined to become prosperous through labor. Yao Shuangxi was originally a landlord who engaged in business and served as the village head of the old regime, exploiting the peasants in every possible way. The peasants of the village were the first to criticize him. After the criticism, Yao's feudal arrogance did not diminish, and he hated cadres and disliked the masses. It was not until after the conclusion of the village-wide anti-feudal movement that his thinking gradually changed, and he realized that he could only have food and clothing if he worked hard. However, he was ideologically conflicted, unwilling to see the masses, and only got up before dawn every day to collect manure. Soon after, he further mobilized his wife to participate in labor, initially doing some needlework, gradually improving her relationship with the peasant women, and also developing labor habits. When the Farmers' Association cadres understood Yao Shuangxi's thoughts, they also tried to take care of him from time to time, which strengthened Yao Shuangxi's determination to transform. Once, when the Farmers' Association was holding a meeting, he entered the door and apologized to everyone, saying, "From now on, I must transform, and produce together with everyone. Can everyone forgive me?" Immediately, all the members decided to give him a set of labor tools and two *shi* of grain, letting him use it as capital for production and labor. After Yao Shuangxi left the meeting place, he secretly wiped away tears of emotion. That night, the neighbor in the same courtyard heard Yao Shuangxi say to his family, "I think the peasants are really generous. Thinking about the past, we really did too much evil." On the sixteenth day of the first month, to comfort the troops, Yao Shuangxi automatically found the Farmers' Association and sent 300 yuan, saying, "This is what I earned from transporting coal, it's a legitimate source, please put my name on it." His wife was not far behind, rushing to make three pairs of military shoes to comfort the troops. From this, Yao Shuangxi became a member of the laboring peasants of Liushu Village. After discussion by all the peasants, they gave him six *mu* of land and four rooms, and helped him move and settle down. Yao Shuangxi also led his wife to the mutual aid brigade and asked to join the mutual aid group, preparing to work hard and become prosperous. Under Yao Shuangxi's influence, all eight landlord households in Liushu Village who had been criticized had transformed and asked to participate in mutual aid production. The mutual aid brigade also helped them with grain and tools, encouraging them to work. Experienced old farmers also said to them, "As long as you transform and labor, I will teach you production methods."

　　清算后思想真正转变
    地主姚双喜参加互助
    农民帮助解决生产困难姚感动落泪
    【本报太岳一日电】长子柳树村被清算地主姚双喜等，思想转变参加了互助组，要依靠劳动发家。姚双喜原系经营地主，并历任旧政权村长，曾百般压榨农民，该村农民首先与他清算。清算后姚封建气焰仍未减，仇视干部厌恶群众，直至全村查封建运动结束后，思想才逐渐有了转变，认识到要下力劳动才能有吃穿，可是思想上又矛盾，不愿见群众，只是每天天不亮起来拾粪。不久又进一步动员了自己女人参加劳动，起初随便做点针线，逐渐与农民妇女们的关系转好，亦有了劳动习惯。农会干部了解了姚双喜的心思，也不时设法照顾他，因此坚定了姚双喜转变的决心。有次农会在开会，他进门便向大家道歉说：“从今以后我一定要转变，和大家一块生产，大家能原谅我不能？”当下全体会员便决议送给他一套劳动工具，两石粮食，让他作为资本生产劳动。姚双喜退出会场后，感动得暗暗的擦着眼泪。当晚同院的邻居，听见姚双喜向他的家人说：“我看农民真够宽宏大量，想想从前咱们实在作恶太甚了。”正月十六日劳军，姚双喜自动找到农会，送上三百元，他说：“这是我运煤赚下的，来路正当，填上我的名字吧。”他的女人亦不落后，赶做三双军鞋劳军。由此姚双喜便成为柳树村劳动农民的一员。经全体农民的讨论，又让给他六亩地、四间房，并帮助他搬家安置。姚双喜又带着他的女人，向互助大队请求参加了互助组，准备下力劳动发家。在姚双喜影响之下，柳树全村被清算的八户地主，皆有转变，纷纷要求参加互助生产，互助大队亦分别帮助粮食工具，鼓励其劳动。有经验的老农并向他们说：“只要你们转变劳动，我教给你们生产办法。”
