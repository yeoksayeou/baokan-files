(Report from our Jinnan correspondent on the 27th) Zhangguantun focuses on ideological education during the distribution of fruits of labor. After the mass movement in Zhangguantun Village, Xiajin First District, many people had ideas about "fate" during the distribution of fruits of labor, believing that demanding land was unreasonable. The leadership guided the masses to start a discussion. First, they analyzed the village's biggest landlord, the Wang family. Zhang Wancai, a man in his sixties, said, "I remember this clearly. The landlord families of Wang Mingqing, Wang Chongqing, Wang Zengqing, Wang Fengrui, and Wang Zhiyu have been oppressing people since their grandfather's time. When Wang Laomu erected a monument for his father, he made everyone in our village contribute. He often didn't pay for the land he bought from poor people. When Wang Mingqing controlled the village administration, he sold the public trees in the village and built walls around his village, putting the remaining money into his accounts. Wasn't that five hectares of land also obtained through exploitation?" Another member said, "Which of Wang's descendants has ever worked in the fields? Landlords live off us poor people." After digging into the roots of the landlords' wealth, everyone suddenly realized that it wasn't that the landlords had good fortune, but that they had exploited the poor. After this deliberation and discussion, everyone demanded land and urgently requested that documents be drawn up and the land be measured immediately.

    老年人畅谈地主来历
    张官屯解除命穷思想
    【本报冀南廿七日电】张官屯分果实中注意思想教育。夏津一区张官屯村群运大动后，在分配果实时，有很多群众有“命运”思想，认为要地不合理。领导上便引导群众展开讨论，首先把该村大地主王家作了分析，六十多岁老头张晚才说：“这事我记得清楚，王明清、王重清、王曾清、王凤瑞、王志玉这几家地主，从他爷爷那时就欺压人，王老木给他父亲立碑，叫咱村每人上分子股。他买穷人的地常不给钱，王明清掌握村政权时，把村里的公树卖了，在他庄子上打围子，剩下的钱放账。那五顷地，还不是剥削来的吗？”又一个会员说：“王家那些子孙，那个下过地？地主是靠咱们穷人活的。”经过挖地主的富根，大家恍然大悟，才知道不是地主命好，而是剥削了穷人。自经过这次酝酿讨论，都要了地，并迫切要求马上立文书、丈量地。
