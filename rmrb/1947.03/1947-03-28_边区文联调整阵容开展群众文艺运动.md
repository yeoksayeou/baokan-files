    Border Region Literary Association Adjusts Lineup to Launch Mass Literary Movement
    [This Newspaper's News] The Border Region Literary Association recently discussed its work guidelines, determining to vigorously launch a mass literary movement in the Border Region and, on the basis of the mass literary movement, improve its own work. It plans to regularly dispatch cadres to various places for investigation and research, understand the work and activities of certain rural theater troupes, mobilize typical examples, concentrate on commendation, and help them improve, study literary publications published in various parts of the Border Region, and strengthen introductions and criticisms to enhance creative enthusiasm. Cadres regularly go to the countryside to learn, exercise, and improve themselves in practical work, preparing for creation. In addition to continuing to compile and publish "Northern Magazine," it will also compile and select literary and other series of books. In order to realize these guidelines, the internal lineup of the Literary Association has also undergone new adjustments. It has been decided to establish two departments, namely the Editorial Department and the Research Department. The original Organization Department will be merged into the Research Department. The Research Department will set up a Data Room, a Creation Group, an Art Group, and a Communication and Liaison Section. Currently, in addition to a few music and drama workers who continue to assist in the work of the Peking University Literary Research Office, most of the cadres of the Literary Association have been concentrated in the resident of the Border Region's headquarters. Comrades Xia Qing and others from the Research Department have gone to areas such as Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, and Zuoquan to investigate mass literary activities. Comrades Zeng Ke, Ge Luo, and others have gone to work on the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region.
    In addition: The Border Region Literary Association has also launched a production and frugality movement. Many comrades have begun spinning cotton and are engaged in agricultural production. It is estimated that in addition to completing production tasks throughout the year, it will also save more than 4,000 kilograms of millet and 240,000 yuan in regular expenses.
