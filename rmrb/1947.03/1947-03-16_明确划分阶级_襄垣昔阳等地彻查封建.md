　　Clearly Define Class Status
    Thorough Investigation of Feudalism in Xiangyuan, Xiyang and Other Places
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 14th] The Xiangyuan Second District convened a village cadre meeting on the 15th of last month to discuss the issue of class status criteria. It was discovered that due to unclear class status criteria, some landlords had not been liquidated. For example, a cadre from Woyangou said: "There is a landlord in our village, but he was classified as a rich peasant, so we can only cut off his tail. As a result, the liquidation was not thorough." The cadres from Pianqiao thought that their village had done a good job, but after discussing the regulations for defining class status, they discovered that there were still some landlords who had not been liquidated. Cadres from Jingguan and Putou said: "The bankrupt landlords in our village pretended to be activists during the movement and even gained more benefits. The masses were dissatisfied and said: 'They are working both ends. They used to exploit people, spending all their money on eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. Now they are sharing the fruits of the revolution again.'" Everyone said: "Now that we have a way to deal with it when we go back, we must clarify the class status and thoroughly defeat the landlords." (Yang Yuchun)
    [Another Dispatch] In mid-February, the Sixth District of Xiyang convened a village cadre meeting. The meeting found that in some villages in the district, due to unclear class status criteria during the mass movement, some middle peasants were wrongly identified as targets of struggle; in some villages, the scope of the struggle reached nearly half of the population. For example, in Henghe Village, out of 70 households, 30 were struggled against. As a result, the class ranks were confused, and the masses were panicked. After inspection and research, it was unanimously agreed that the correct definition of class status is a very important issue. It was decided to re-classify based on the class status criteria set by the District Party Committee, distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves. Those who were wrongly struggled against should be compensated, and those who had not been struggled against should be resolutely struggled against. The Zhanshang pilot point has now been re-classified and the movement is deeply underway. This will not only thoroughly eliminate feudalism, but also prevent confusion in the ranks.

　　明确划分阶级
    襄垣昔阳等地彻查封建
    【本报太行十四日电】襄垣二区于上月十五日召开村干部会，讨论关于划分阶级标准问题。发现由于划分阶级标准不明确，致一些地主未经清算。如卧羊沟干部说：“我村有个地主，但把他划为富农，只能割尾巴，结果清算不彻底。”偏桥干部自认为他村搞的可以了，当讨论划分阶级标准规定后，发现还有些地主未经清算。井关、普头干部说：“我村的破产地主在运动中假装积极分子，还多得果实，群众不满意说：‘人家是两头干，从前剥削人，吃喝嫖赌弄光了，现在又在分果实’。”大家说：“这次回去可有办法啦，一定要将阶级划清彻底斗垮地主。”（杨玉春）
    【又讯】昔阳六区在二月中旬召开村干部会，检查出该区在群运中，部分村子因阶级划分标准不明确，将一些中农划为斗争对象；有些村斗争面几至一半，如横河村共七十户，即有三十户被斗。因此阶级阵营混乱，群众恐慌。经检查研究后，一致认为正确的划分阶级是个很重要的问题，决定以区党委所定之划分阶级的标准来重划，分清敌我，误斗者退、没斗者坚决斗。现在沾尚基点已经重划，深入运动，这样既彻底消灭封建，也不怕混乱了阵营。
