[This newspaper report from Zuoquan] After the district-wide village cadre activists and some honest peasants' meeting in the First District (see page 2 of this newspaper on March 6), the movement to rectify the relationship between cadres and the masses and to further mobilize the "backward" to squeeze out feudalism has penetrated into various villages. Chengguan and Houyaoyu started by mobilizing all the village activists to let everyone examine whether the peasants were truly united and whether the landlords had truly given up. Then they turned to door-to-door specific inspections, only to find that there were still masses who had not participated in the meetings at all, 26 men and 27 women. The reasons were mainly as follows: one was dissatisfaction because they had not received any fruits of the struggle and were instigated by the landlords. For example, Liu Shengjin of South Street was forgotten several times when distributing the fruits of struggle. He was unhappy and had a kinship with the landlord, so he was pulled away and stopped attending meetings. Another reason was that the cadres were temporarily careless and underestimated the "backward." For example, the extremely poor Liu Niuxiao had worked as a long-term worker for the landlord for seven or eight years and suffered great exploitation. He believed that it was his fate to be poor, and he never said a word at the meetings. Last winter, when it was proposed to face the backward, the cadre activists forced him to answer, "Don't you have any suffering?" He said, "I have suffered a lot and have been exploited by feudalism." The activists thought his statement was too general and rejected him, and he never became active again. Li Guisheng promoted for the landlord because he did not get any fruit of the struggle: "In this era, the struggle is just blind fighting! The reason cannot be explained at any time." These concrete facts educated the cadres to further realize that the reason why landlords do not bow their heads is that they still have someone to rely on. They all said: "If these 'backward' people are not called back and mobilized quickly, the landlords will definitely continue to be active!" When discussing how to mobilize the masses, a cadre said: "Since the 'backward' masses have dissatisfaction in their hearts, they must be allowed to speak their minds in order to truly awaken." Therefore, the first urgent task is for our cadres to wash their faces and admit their mistakes to the masses and make the distribution of the fruits of struggle fair." Everyone agreed with this and was determined to admit their mistakes to the masses. On March 11, a mass training of peasants was conducted, with more than 1,500 peasants, both men and women, participating and organizing eight detachments for deliberation and examination. For the first two days, the cadres washed their faces to the masses by recalling their own history. From the examination, the cadres realized that their "bluntness" and the excessive distribution of fruits of struggle were all the mental illnesses of the "backward" and the broad masses, and they became more determined to examine and admit their mistakes. The village chief of Houyaoyu said: "Speaking of the old society, where was the position of our poor people? When we moved up from the mountain, the rich people did not allow us to join the commune. Who would have thought that this generation could become the village chief? Times have been good! But when distributing the fruits of struggle, I didn't care whether everyone was happy or not. I liked an oil cabinet, so I took it. I felt that I was the village chief, who would dare to object? Now I understand that I must serve everyone and not just plan for myself. I resolutely withdraw the cabinet for everyone and am also willing to take out four mu of the best land to distribute to the masses for cultivation." Xi Lin, a cadre in North Street, also frankly reflected to everyone: "In the distribution of fruits of struggle in the summer, I was hesitant and didn't regard all our peasants as one family, so I distributed the rotten grain to the masses in Dongguan and kept the good grain for our North Street. Finally, there were two dou of millet left, and I secretly took them back with Suoyuan and made cakes! I stole a basin, and no one knew about it. Now I realize that these are all wrong, and I will return them all to the masses." Many cadres made reflections one after another. Due to the cadres' sincerity and frankness, on the one hand, it encouraged the masses and broke the masses' concerns about not daring to raise opinions to the cadres, and also further inspired and moved the peasants' class feelings towards the cadres. Honest peasants who never dared to speak out said: "Our cadres are all speaking from their hearts. If they don't say it, who would know? They are really more united than a family!" Because of the masses' excitement, it also encouraged the cadres' enthusiasm for examination. The cadres turned their concerns into excitement. At the last general review meeting, the cadres handed over the fruits of struggle they had over-distributed, some took furniture, some carried grain to the meeting place and handed it over to the masses. Xi Lin said: "I'm sorry everyone, I ate the two dou of millet in the first month of the year. I'll return two dou of corn, I don't know if it's okay?" The masses all said: "One family doesn't speak two languages. It doesn't matter if the things are clean or not, it's important to correct the problems and lead us forward. Defeating the landlord is better than anything." The vice chairman of the West Guan Farmers Association took a woolen scarf and examined it to everyone, saying: "Speaking of the origin of this scarf, it has been my heart disease for several years! A few years ago, I worked as a long-term worker for a rich man. Once, I picked up a scarf and tried it on my neck, but I was scolded by him because he thought it would get lice on him. Since then, I have hated him in my heart and always wanted to get a good scarf. When distributing the fruits of struggle, I didn't care what everyone thought and exchanged a thread scarf for a woolen scarf. Now I resolutely return it to everyone." His statement greatly aroused the class feelings of the masses, who said: "It's good to say what's wrong in the open. It can be forgiven." After six days of intensive examination, not only were opinions smoothed out and the relationship between cadres and the masses improved, but also the backward were initially mobilized. According to statistics, among the original 26 male "backward," not only did they all speak, but also 12 new activists emerged. After the meeting, the "backward" masses' awareness greatly increased, and they found the farmers' association one after another to report the hidden materials they had preserved for the landlords. Yang Chengxiang of South Street said: "If it weren't for these five or six days of meetings, I wouldn't dare to say it. Only then did I realize that we are all one family. In the past, we lived in the house of landlord Zhao ××, and we were afraid that he would be unhappy and have no house to live in, so we preserved a satin quilt and more than a dozen silk clothes for him. Now I'm not afraid anymore," and vowed: "Now I'll hand over the things and never be a 'bomb shelter' again." Zhao Laini of Dongguan handed over the cabinet preserved for the landlord, and Liu Yuhe of South Street handed over 30,000 Jicha and more than 200 jin of cloth preserved for the landlord, all voluntarily. Currently, the mobilization of the backward and the squeezing out of feudalism is still continuing.

    干部变顾虑为兴奋
    【本报左权讯】一区经过全区村干积极分子及部分老实农民会后（见三月六日本报二版），整顿干群关系继续发动“落后”挤封建的运动，已深入各村。城关、后窑峪是从动员全村积极分子入手，让大家检查农民究竟齐心了没有？地主究竟死心了没有？等问题，随后即转入挨门挨户的具体检查，才发现还有根本没参加过会的群众，有男廿六人，女廿七人。研究原因主要有以下情况：一种是因没分到果实不满，受了地主挑拨的。如南街刘生金好几次分果实都忘了他，他不高兴，和地主又是亲戚关系，就被拉去了，会也不参加了；还有一种是干部一时不注意，轻视“落后”了的。如赤贫刘牛小给地主住了七、八年长工，受剥削顶大，他认为是命穷，开会永不吭气，去冬提出面向落后时，干部积极分子硬逼住问他“你就一点苦也没有”？他说：“我受罪不小，受过封建剥削。”积极分子嫌他说的笼统便碰回去了，自此再不积极。李贵生因没分上果实替地主宣传“这年头斗争只是瞎斗哩！理由到什时也说不清”。从这些具体事实中教育了干部更加认识了地主不低头还是有靠头的道理，都说：“这些‘落后’人们如果不往回叫，不赶快发动，地主一定还要活动哩！”在讨论如何发动问题时，某干部说：“落后”群众心里既然有不满意，就必须叫他们说了心里话，才能真正觉悟起来。因此头一件当紧事就是咱们干部必须向群众洗脸认错，把果实弄公道。这一说大家都想通了，向群众洗脸反省的道理决心向群众认错。三月十一号进行了农民大集训，全体农民一千五百余人，男女一齐参加组织了八个分队，进行酝酿检讨。头两天是干部从回忆自己历史中向群众洗脸。从检讨中干部认识了自己“碰人”和多分果实都是“落后”人和广大群众的心病，越检讨认错的决心越大。后窑峪村长说：“提起旧社会来，那里有咱穷人的地位，咱从岭下搬上来，老财们不准入社，那想到这一辈还能当了村长呢？时光也过好啦！但分果实时，我却不管大家碰心不碰心，自己爱准了一个油柜，便分上了，觉的咱是村长谁敢驳回头？现在想通了，我要为大家办事不能光打算自己。坚决把柜给大家退出，另外还情愿拿出四亩顶好地，分给群众种”。北街干部喜林也坦白的向大家反省“夏天分果实中，我就是三心二意没把咱农民都看成一家人，所以把烂粮食都分给东关群众，留下好的都分给俺北街了。最后剩下二斗黍子，我偷偷和锁元背回去吃了糕啦！偷了个盆谁也不知道，我现在才认清这些都是不应该的，一齐给群众退出来”。不少干部都接二连三的作了反省。由于干部的真诚坦白，一方面给群众壮了胆，打破了群众不敢向干部提意见的顾虑，也进一步启发与感动了农民对干部的阶级情感。永不好吭气的老实农民都纷纷说：“咱干部们都是说的良心话，人家不说谁知道？真是比一家人还一心哩！”由于群众这样的兴奋，也更鼓舞了干部的检讨热情，干部把顾虑变成了兴奋。最后一次总检讨会，干部们把多分的果实，有的拿家具，有的背粮食送在会场交给群众，喜林说：“对不起大家，我把二斗黍子正月已经吃了，还大家二斗玉茭不知行不行？”群众都说：“一家人不说两家话，说清理东西不东西不要紧，改正毛病好好领导往前干地主就比什也强”。西关农会副主席拿着一条毛围巾向大家检讨说：“说起这条围巾的来由，是我好几年的心病啦！前几年给人家老财住长工，一次拿起人家一条围巾，刚从脖子里试了一试，就被人家骂了一顿，嫌给人家沾上虱子了。从此心里发恨，总想要捣个好围巾，分果实时就不管大家怎样，拿一条线围巾换一条毛围巾，现在坚决给大家退出来。”他这一说：大大激动了群众的阶级情感，都说：“有不是说在明处就好，可以原谅”。经过六天的集中检讨，不但疏通意见，改善干群关系，同时也初步发动了落后。据统计原先二十六个男“落后”中，不但都说了话，而且涌现出十二个新积极分子。会后“落后”群众觉悟大大提高，纷纷找到农会报出给地主保存的隐藏物资。南街杨成祥说：“要不是开这五六天会，我还不敢说，这一下我才认清咱们到底是一家人，过去咱住地主赵××房，光怕人家不高兴了没房住，便给人家保存了一条缎被子和十多件绸缎衣服，这一下我可不怕啦，并发誓说：这一下把东西交出来，再也不当“防空洞”了。东关赵来牛给地主保存的柜，南街刘玉和给地主保存的冀钞三万元，布二百余斤，全都自动报出来了。目前仍在继续发动落后和挤封建中。
