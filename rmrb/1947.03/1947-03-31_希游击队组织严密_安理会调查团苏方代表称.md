Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 27th: Reports from various sources indicate that the UN Security Council's investigation team on the Greek border dispute has completed its investigation in Greece and arrived in Sofia, Bulgaria, on the 25th. They will work in Sofia for three days. The team's final report to the Security Council is scheduled to be drafted in Geneva in mid-April. According to Mr. Krul, the Soviet representative who met with General Markos, the commander of the Greek People's Army, told reporters: "I was particularly impressed by the guerrillas' high level of discipline, strong organization, and confidence in achieving their goals. The guerrillas control a considerable area, which does not have precise borders, but the guerrilla zone is permanent and stable. In every village controlled by the guerrillas, a mediation committee has been established, whose job it is to resolve all disputes that arise between those who support armed resistance to the Greek government and those who oppose it." When reporters asked about the content of the UN Security Council delegation's conversation with General Markos, Mr. Krul replied: "This has been recorded in a document that is 238 pages long. Given its particular importance, the document will be translated into English, Russian, and French and submitted to the UN Security Council delegation."
