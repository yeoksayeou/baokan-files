　　Absorbing Families of Soldiers to Help Each Other with Plowing, Using Grain to Repay Labor:
    Jize Stipulates Methods for Substitute Plowing
    [This newspaper, Jize, reports] The entire Jize county has more than 3,500 households of families of soldiers, workers, and martyrs. After land reform, they collectively own 875 *qing* of land, equivalent to one-fifth of the land in the entire county. For such a small county with fewer than 90,000 people, ensuring that the land of soldiers' families is not left uncultivated and that they are well-fed and clothed is a significant task. At the end of the year, cadres from the entire county gathered to study the issue of substitute plowing and summarized the following methods: 1. The principle is to ensure that the land of soldiers' families is not left uncultivated and that their lives are prosperous. 2. Families of soldiers should not provide substitute plowing for other families of soldiers. 3. Based on the presence or absence of labor and the size of wealth, various methods are stipulated, including full substitute plowing, partial substitute plowing, and no substitute plowing. 4. Families of soldiers, workers, and martyrs should also be organized into mutual aid groups as much as possible, guiding them to engage in production with others in mutual aid. The participation of soldiers' families in mutual aid groups should also be based on voluntary association, but it should be arranged reasonably and not clumped together. 5. All harvests from the portion of land of soldiers' families that is substitute-plowed should be handed over to the families of soldiers; the portion that is not substitute-plowed but rented out should be treated as rented land. 6. The labor used for substitute plowing the land of soldiers' families will be paid by the public village with grain during the wheat and autumn harvests. The grain used for this is called "substitute plowing grain," and the families of soldiers do not pay for substitute plowing grain. Poor, orphaned, and widowed individuals may be exempt from allocation. (Song Jichang)

　　吸收抗属互助以代耕粮还工
    鸡泽规定代耕办法
    【本报鸡泽讯】鸡泽全县共抗、军、工、烈属三千五百余户，经土地改革后，他们共有了土地八百七十五顷，相当全县土地五分之一，这样一个不足九万人口的小县。为保证抗属地不荒、丰衣足食，代耕任务相当重大，年关全县干部集合研究代耕问题，总结出以下办法：一、原则是保证抗属不荒地，生活富裕。二、抗属不给其他抗属代耕。三、根据劳力有无与富力大小，规定全代耕、部分代耕、及不代耕等各种办法。四、抗、军、工、烈属也要尽量组织到互助组里，领导他们与别人互助生产，抗属参加互助组，虽也要自愿结合，但要按排的合理，不要打堆。五、抗属土地代耕部分之收获全交抗属，不代耕租出部分以租地论。六、代耕抗属土地所用的工，公村于麦秋两季派粮，按一般规定以粮还工，此粮叫“代耕粮”，抗属不出代耕粮。贫苦孤寡可不派。（宋济昌）
