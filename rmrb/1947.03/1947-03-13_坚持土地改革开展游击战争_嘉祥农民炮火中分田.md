　　Persisting in Land Reform and Launching Guerrilla Warfare
    Jiaxiang Peasants Divide Land Amidst Gunfire
    [Report from our newspaper in the JiluYu area on the 10th] Around the time that Chiang's army re-occupied Jiaxiang city (southwestern Shandong), the broad masses of peasants in the county persisted in land reform and actively launched guerrilla warfare. After the city was recovered in January, a fervent anti-traitor, revenge and land reform movement unfolded. When Chiang's army counterattacked in mid-February, the masses had already been mobilized: on the 13th, the enemy attacked Juye, the artillery fire filled the sky, and Chiang's planes circled low over Jiaxiang all day, but the peasants continued to distribute grain and land in an organized manner. They said: "I would rather be bombed to death by planes than starve to death!" Until the day before Jiaxiang city fell (the 19th), the masses still enthusiastically discussed the method of land distribution. That night, they took back the contracts from the landlords. The masses happily said: "Tomorrow we will go to identify the land boundaries and mark them with lime (meaning to delineate the boundaries with lime), we must clearly identify our land." They also said: "Don't be afraid, the Central Army can't stop us from dividing the land." After the grain and land were distributed, the masses immediately armed themselves to defend the fruits of their liberation. Local cadres also separately convened village cadre meetings, peasant congresses, and landlord meetings. At the meetings, cadres and the masses unanimously and enthusiastically expressed their determination to persist in guerrilla warfare and defend the fruits of their labor. The landlords also swore to the peasants that: "If the Central Army comes and I do bad things, I am willing to be punished by the masses." Currently, activists and cadres throughout the county are combining with county and district armed forces to persist in land reform and launch guerrilla warfare.

　　坚持土地改革开展游击战争
    嘉祥农民炮火中分田
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】蒋军再陷嘉祥城（鲁西南）前后，该县广大农民坚持土地改革，并积极开展游击战争。该城自一月间收复后，即热烈展开反奸复仇与土地改革运动。当蒋军于二月中旬反扑时，群众业已发动起来：十三日敌进攻巨野，炮火连天，蒋机终日在嘉祥低空盘旋，农民们仍有组织的继续进行分粮分地，他们说：“宁叫飞机炸死，也不能饿死！”直至嘉祥城陷落的前一日（十九日），群众仍照常热烈讨论分配土地办法，当夜即从地主手中索回文约，群众欢天喜地的说：“明天去认地边，扎灰脚（按即用石灰划地界），是咱的地要弄清楚。”又说：“不怕，中央军来了也挡不住我们分地。”粮食和土地分配后，群众立即武装起来保卫翻身果实，当地干部又分别召开村干会、农民大会与地主会。在会上干部群众一致热烈表示坚持游击战，保卫果实的决心，地主亦向农民宣誓保证：“中央军来到，我要坏了，愿受群众制裁。”现全县积极分子和干部正与县区武装结合，坚持土地改革，开展游击战争。
