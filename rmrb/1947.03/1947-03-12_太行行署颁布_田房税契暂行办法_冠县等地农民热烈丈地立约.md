　　Taihang Administrative Office Issues Provisional Measures for Land and Property Tax Deeds
　　Peasants in Guan County and Other Areas Enthusiastically Measure Land and Establish Contracts
　　[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 9th] The Taihang Administrative Office, in order to protect the land and property rights obtained by peasants, and to stabilize their productive enthusiasm, issued the "Provisional Measures for Land and Property Tax Deeds in the Taihang Area" on February 25th. The main points are as follows: 1. All newly acquired land and houses obtained during the "Land to the Tiller" movement and the confiscated property obtained from the anti-traitor struggle have the same legal rights as self-purchased property. In order to obtain property rights protection, taxes should be paid to the government in accordance with regulations to obtain formal deeds. 2. The legal rights of land and property are based on the official deeds of the democratic government, and the deeds of non-democratic governments are invalid. 3. Old government deeds before the War of Resistance and enemy-puppet government deeds during the War of Resistance are all invalid and must be re-taxed to obtain formal deeds from the democratic government. Land and property that have not been taxed for many years should also be taxed and deeds obtained. 4. The tax rate and deed price are stipulated as follows: Purchase deeds and land and houses newly obtained by peasants are taxed at 8% of the land and property price, and mortgage deeds are taxed at 4%. The deed price is uniformly determined by the Prefectural Commissioner's Office based on labor and material costs, and the county shall not increase or decrease it at will.
　　[Another dispatch] The Taihang Third Prefectural Commissioner's Office has instructed all counties to immediately implement the administrative office's land and property tax deed measures, and to universally complete the tax deeds before Grain Rain.
　　[This newspaper's Wei County dispatch, 10th] Various places are carrying out land measurement and chasing deeds, and peasants are actively recovering land. In order to break the masses' ideological concerns and consolidate land rights, the Fourth District of Guan County is launching a great production campaign this spring. All district cadres are leading peasants to measure land and establish new contracts. Currently, two-thirds of the 30 villages in the district have completed the measurement, and the masses have reflected one after another: "The land is really ours now, and we must farm it well in the future." In Fuxi Village, the liberated peasants of the Third District of Jize County, with the village cadres and appraisers acting as brokers, measured the land together with the landlords who were struggled against and the poor peasants who were divided the land. The poor peasants measured as much as they should be allocated, and then established new contracts. The long-term worker Dong Yuan said: "I worked as a long-term worker for the landlord for more than 20 years and didn't buy a single piece of land. I couldn't even take care of my life. Now I have been allocated 5.5 mu of garden land and more than 6 mu of dry land. I must produce well this year." After 16 poverty-stricken peasant households in Weizhuang, Xin County, were allocated land, they still did not believe that the land was theirs because they had not measured it and issued red deed documents. When asked how many mu of land they had, they all said the old land number. The Turn-Over Inspection Team, based on the demands of the masses, led the establishment of contracts and land measurement, asked the landlords to hand over the red deed documents, and personally pointed out the land boundaries in the field for measurement. Affected by this village, Sanlizhuang and Xiazhuang nearby have also started this work.

　　太行行署颁布
    田房税契暂行办法
    冠县等地农民热烈丈地立约
    【本报太行九日电】太行行署为保障农民所获土地、房屋之所有权，安定其生产情绪，特于二月二十五日颁发“太行区田房税契暂行办法”，其要点如下：一、凡在耕者有其田运动中新得之田、房及反奸斗争中分得之逆产，均与自己置买之田产同有合法权益，为取得财权保障，应照章向政府纳税，取得正式契照。二、田房之合法权益，以民主政府之正式契照为准，非民主政府之契纸均属无效。三、抗战前旧政府契纸及抗战时期敌伪政府之契纸，一律无效，必须重新投税，领取民主政府正式契纸。远年未税，亦应投税领契。四、税率及契纸价规定如下：买契及农民新得之田房，均按田房价格百分之八征税，典契按百分之四征税。契纸价由专署视工料费用统一规定，县不得随意增减。
    【又讯】太行三专署顷指示各县迅即执行行署田房税契办法，务于谷雨前普遍完成税契。
    【本报威县十日电】各地进行丈地、追契，农民积极收回土地。冠县四区为打破群众思想顾虑，巩固地权，开展今春的大生产运动，全区干部正领导农民丈地、立新文约。现全区三十个村有二分之一的村已丈量完竣，群众纷纷反映说：“土地真归咱有了，以后可要好好的种地。”鸡泽三区浮西村翻身农民在丈地中，村干和评议员当经纪人，被斗地主、分地贫农一齐去丈量土地，贫农应分多少就丈量多少，丈量好后，立新约。长工东元说：“我给地主做了二十多年长工，没买下一分地，连生活都顾不住，现在分了五亩五分园地，六亩多旱地，今年一定要好好生产。”莘县魏庄十六户赤贫农分得土地后，因没丈量要出红契文书，仍不认为地是自己的。如问有几亩地，他们都说老地数。翻身检查队便根据群众要求，领导立契丈地，让地主交出红契文书，并亲到地里指给地边，进行丈量。附近三里庄、夏庄受这村影响，也开始这一工作。
