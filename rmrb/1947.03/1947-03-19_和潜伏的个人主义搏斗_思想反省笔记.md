　　Battling Latent Individualism
　　Reflections on Thought
　　·Wei Yu·
　　Recently, I spent half a month examining my own thoughts, and the following are the specific problems I have reflected upon.
　　1. Complaining about my own unfair treatment, demanding perfection from others.
　　Applying Marxism-Leninism to others but liberalism to oneself is a characteristic of individualism. Therefore, I always feel that since joining the revolution, I have made too many sacrifices and suffered too much. For several years, I have been working while ill, without proper care from the organization. I have never received health care expenses, never worn an overcoat, never bought a pen, never had a gold tooth, always clean sleeves, penniless, lonely and pitiful... All of these seem like debts the revolution owes me. Therefore, although I have completed my tasks at work, every time I think of these things, it lowers my revolutionary enthusiasm and work initiative. This is a terrible burden, a stumbling block to personal progress, and fundamentally incompatible with the spirit of hard struggle. It should be recognized that our revolution is voluntary, and the glory of a revolutionary soldier lies in the spirit of self-sacrifice to serve the people; in the spirit of transforming the individual into the collective and sacrificing the small self to save the greater self; it is impossible to imagine that there are revolutionary professionals who enjoy wealth and high position. The above-mentioned sacrifices and pains are insignificant compared to the millions of martyred revolutionary predecessors, and insignificant compared to the millions of front-line soldiers; in terms of enjoying benefits, it is also better than those below and worse than those above. When the extremely reactionary ruling class of my own big family stubbornly insists on selling the country, dictatorship, civil war, and even using the Yellow River to kill people, if we do not engage in arduous struggle, how can we defeat this evil rule and eliminate the root causes of all hardships?
　　Everyone who grows up in the old society inevitably has both strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, when looking at people, one must be comprehensive and see which aspect is more dominant. My problem is that I discover the shortcomings of others most and first, and underestimate the advantages of others. For example, I demand that the leaders be better than me in all aspects, have leadership ability, have a righteous style, have a democratic spirit, etc., in short, they must be impeccable in every way. I am also insufficiently understanding and excessively demanding of comrades. This is clearly a most terrible style. The correct attitude should be to humbly learn from the strengths of others and kindly criticize the shortcomings of others.

　　和潜伏的个人主义搏斗
    思想反省笔记
    ·畏予·
    最近花了半个月工夫，对自己的思想作了一番检查，下面就是我反省到的几个具体问题。
  一、替自己鸣不平，对旁人责全备。
    对旁人马列主义，对自己自由主义，是个人主义的特点之一。因此总觉得自己参加革命以来，受的牺牲太大，吃的苦头太多，几年来总是带病工作，组织上没有很好照顾，从来没有领过保健费，没有穿过大衣，没有买过钢笔，没有镶过金牙，总是两袖清风，一文莫名，独身可怜……。所有这些都好象是革命对自己的亏欠，因此虽然在工作中也完成了自己的任务，但每一念及就会降低自己的革命热情和工作积极性，这是一个可怕的包袱，个人进步的绊脚石，是与艰苦奋斗的作风根本不能相容的东西。应当认清我们革命是自愿的，而革命战士之所以光荣，就在于为人民服务的自我牺牲精神；就在于化个人于集体以小我救大我的舍己为群的气魄；不能想象世界上有安富尊荣的革命职业家。上述所谓牺牲与痛苦，比起千百万殉难者的先烈，是渺小的，比起千百万的前线战士是微不足道的；论得遇享受也是比上不足比下有余的，在反动透顶的本大家族的统治硬要卖国、独裁、内战以至用黄水杀人的时候，我们不来艰苦奋斗，又怎么能打垮这种罪恶统治，消灭一切艰难困苦的根源呢？
    从旧社会里生长起来的每个人，存在着优点与缺点，是难免的。因此看人要全面，要看在它身上哪种更占优势。我的坏处就在于最多与最先的发现旁人的缺点，而过低估计旁人的缺点，而过低估计旁人的优点，如地领导人要求各方面都比我好，要有领导能力，要有正派作风，要有民主精神等等，反正要头头是道面面俱全才行。对同志们也是谅解不足苛求这显然是一种最恶劣的作风。正确的态度，应是虚心地学习旁人长处，善意地批评旁人缺点。
