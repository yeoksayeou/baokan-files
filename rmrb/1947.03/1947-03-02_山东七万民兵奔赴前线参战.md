Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 28th—Over 70,000 Shandong soldiers and civilians have surged to the front lines to undertake wartime service, forming an unprecedented upsurge of militia participation in the war. Several fire line rescue teams were formed by militia companies on the Lu Zhong front. Each team was equipped with more than 300 stretchers to carry out fire line rescue. Yang Zhonggui, a model stretcher bearer squad from Yi (Shui) Central District, disregarding the Kuomintang army's machine-gun fire, bravely followed the infantry forward. In the southern suburbs of Laiwu, they braved artillery fire to rescue the wounded, providing care with their own medicines along the way. The Yi (Shui) South People's Soldiers Regiment discussed cooperative combat with the Liberation Army soldiers. The regiment presented the militia with two light machine guns and over a hundred rifles, exuding an atmosphere of friendship and mutual assistance.
