    Great Reunion in the Liberated Area
    A Record of Meeting Captured Chiang Soldiers after the Laiwu Campaign

    "I never imagined we'd have a great reunion in the liberated area today..." This is what Li Xianzhou, Lieutenant General and the highest commander of the Chiang army's northern line in the Lunan Campaign, said to the reporter with great emotion after meeting his subordinates, the division, regimental, and other officers of the 73rd Army, on the afternoon of March 4th. He was lying in bed with a leg injury (previously mistakenly reported as an abdominal injury). The water in the kettle on the coal stove was boiling, and warm steam filled the inner room. A People's Liberation Army doctor lifted the cotton door curtain and came in to give him an injection. Those of Li's subordinates, including Li Chen, Deputy Commander of the 73rd Army, Yang Ming, Commander of the 15th Division, Xiao Chongguang, Commander of the 193rd Division, and Tan Shuchu, Commander of the 45th Regiment, were relieved to see that Li was only shot in the leg. Deputy Commander Li Chen said with a smile: "Today everyone has met, it's truly a great reunion."

    In another room, the majors of the 46th Division were also meeting each other cordially. They chatted warmly with Wei Zhaoxin, the commander of the 564th Regiment, who had been discovered by a reporter a few days ago in a small thatched cottage near the battlefield. Wei Zhaoxin was also present. At that time, he had disguised himself as a private and hid for four days without drinking water. After the reporter explained the lenient policy and introduced the pleasant life of the captured Chiang army senior officer corps, Regiment Commander Wei frankly admitted his rank and real name and anxiously asked the reporter: "Did our Brigade Commander Hai (referring to Hai Jingqiang, Brigade Commander of the 188th Brigade) die in battle?" The reporter told him at the time that Hai was being treated with great courtesy in the People's Liberation Army, which he did not believe. Today, he saw Brigade Commander Hai in person and happily told the reporter that fortunately, we did not die unjustly in the civil war. In another corner of the room, Brigade Commander Hai Jingqiang was warmly receiving his former colleagues, including Gan Chengcheng, the commander of the 175th Brigade, who was being helped in with a leg injury, followed by Deputy Brigade Commander Chen Jiong and You Jingxiang, Director of the Brigade's Political Department. Brigade Commander Gan said: It is really rare for us to meet in the Communist area. We were nameless "black officials" in the Kuomintang, fighting a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek. It is really unjust to be injured, thinking about it. Deputy Brigade Commander Chen Jiong said excitedly: I am truly happy and hateful today. I am happy to be reunited in the liberated area, and I hate that I participated in the civil war and so many people died. In the past, it was gratifying to die in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but now who cares about these orphans and widows? Many people lowered their heads after hearing this, and the room was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. He continued: "I hope the civil war ends soon, and I hope that this reunion in the liberated area is a prelude to the reunion with our parents, wives, and children in the near future."

    【Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th】Chiang army youth officers who have been newly liberated deeply feel through personal experience that devoting themselves to the people's liberation cause is the only bright path. As of now, 135 people have been approved to transfer to the East China Military and Political University for study. Before their departure, they sincerely stated: "After arriving at the Military and Political University, we will definitely seize the opportunity to study, strengthen our determination, and engage in the revolutionary cause, so as not to fail the kindness of the people and the Communist Party."

    在解放区大团圆
    莱芜战役就俘蒋军会见记
    “想不到今天在解放区大团圆………”这是鲁南会战中被俘蒋军北线最高指挥官李仙洲中将，在三月四日下午会见了他的部下七十三军军师团干部后颇有感触地对记者的话。他小腿受伤（前误为腹部受伤）躺在床上，煤炉上的壶水沸腾，内室内弥漫着温暖的水蒸气，一位解放军的医师掀开棉门帘进来给他打针治疗。那些李氏的部下七十三军副军长李琛、十五师师长杨明、一九三师师长萧重光、四十五团团长谭述初等亲眼看到李氏仅是腿部中弹都放下了心。李琛副军长笑着说：“今天大家都会面了，真是大团圆了。”
    在另一间房子里，四十六师的少校们也彼此会见了，他们亲切的交谈着那位前几天被记者在战场附近一间小茅屋里发现的五六四团长韦照心；韦照心也在场，那时他伪装小兵躲藏了四天没喝水，经记者解释宽大政策及介绍被俘蒋军高级军官团的愉快生活后，韦团长坦然承认了自己的职别和真姓名，并焦虑的问记者：“我们的海旅长（按指一八八旅旅长海竞强）是否阵亡”？记者当时告诉他海氏在解放军中备受优待，他不信，今天他亲自看见了海旅长，欣喜的告诉记者，幸而我们都没有在内战里冤枉的死掉。在屋子的另一角落，海竞强旅长正在热情的招待旧同僚，其中有腿部受伤被扶进来的一七五旅旅长甘成城，后面跟着副旅长陈炯、旅政治部主任游靖湘，甘旅长说：我们在共产党地区会见真是难得，我们在国民党里是没有名字的黑官，还替蒋介石打内战，受了伤，想起来真冤枉。陈炯副旅长则激动的说：我今天真是又喜又恨，喜的是在解放区团圆，恨的是参加了内战，死了这么多人，过去抗日战争死了是甘心的，现在谁来理睬这批孤儿寡妇？许多人听了低着头，屋里静得可以听见银针落地的声音。他接着说：“我盼望内战早日结束，希望这次在解放区的团圆是不久将来和父母妻子团圆的一种预兆。”
    【新华社华东前线十日电】新解放之蒋军青年官佐经亲身体验深感只有献身于人民解放事业才是光明出路，截止目前已有一百三十五人获准转入华东军政大学学习。行前他们诚恳表示：“至军政大学后一定抓紧学习机会，坚定决心，干革命事业，才不辜负人民和共产党的恩情”。
