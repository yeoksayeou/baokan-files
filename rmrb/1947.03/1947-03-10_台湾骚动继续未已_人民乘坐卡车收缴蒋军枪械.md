Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 8th: According to the Central News Agency, Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan Province, fearing the power of the people's resistance in the province, have been forced to adopt a softening policy in an attempt to ease the people's resistance. After the uprising occurred on the 28th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek immediately sent his Minister of the Interior, Zhang Lisheng, to Taiwan. The Taiwan provincial authorities also requested instructions from the Chiang central government. Subsequently, Chen Yi, the Chief Executive of Taiwan and a member of the Kuomintang, announced on the 6th that he intended to change the Chief Executive's Office into a provincial government. Some Taiwanese would be absorbed into the positions of provincial government committee members and department heads. Regarding county and city chiefs opposed by the people, the local county and city councils, "legal" organizations, etc., would nominate three people, from which the Chief Executive would select one to serve. The "reform" of county and city chiefs and administrative levels at all levels will be decided after the government is reorganized. According to the Central News Agency, the situation in various parts of Taiwan Province has gradually calmed down. The trains in Tainan City, managed by Taiwanese personnel, resumed operations on the 5th. However, Chen Yi's broadcast revealed that various counties and cities have not yet fully restored "order." As of the 6th, Taiwanese people were still riding trucks on the roads collecting weapons from Chiang Kai-shek's army, and it was said that the food problem in Taiwan was extremely serious. The price of rice has risen to 60 Taiwan dollars per catty (note that the price of rice in Taipei in early January was 18 Taiwan dollars per catty), equivalent to a rise from over 600 yuan to over 2,000 yuan in Chiang currency per catty. Students at Taiwan University have been eating thin congee for several days.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 7th: (Delayed dispatch from) Taipei, 26th of last month: Due to the impact of the rising tide of gold and US dollars in the mainland, general prices in Taiwan have suddenly risen by more than one and a half times, surpassing the speed of price increases during the Japanese occupation period. Before Chiang Kai-shek announced the "Emergency Measures Plan," the Taiwan Provincial authorities implemented the so-called "Emergency Control Act" on the 14th, prohibiting the buying and selling of US dollars and completely controlling import and export trade, expanding bureaucratic capital monopoly, and promoting the continued rise in prices. Workers, unable to make a living, have become involved in labor strikes at the Monopoly Bureau's tobacco and alcohol factories, camphor factories, the Resources Committee's cement and fertilizer plants, and factories affiliated with several provincial companies. This phenomenon was unseen even during the Japanese occupation period. Industry and commerce are monopolized by the Chiang government, and private commercial firms and factories are preparing to close down one after another. A small number are converting to small-scale factories, manufacturing tinplate, cork, and the like to eke out a living. The general civil servants' monthly salary is only over 5,000 Taiwan dollars, equivalent to no more than 180,000 "legal tender," and they are suffering greatly due to the continued high prices.

　　台湾骚动继续未已
    人民乘坐卡车收缴蒋军枪械
    【新华社延安八日电】据中央社透露：蒋介石及台省国民党当局，因惧于该省人民反抗之威力，已被迫采取软化政策，企图缓和人民之反抗。上月二十八日骚动发生后，蒋介石即派其内政部长张厉生赴台，台省当局亦向蒋中央请示，接着国民党、台湾行政长官陈仪于六日广播称：拟将行政长官公署改为省政府，省府委员及厅处长职位吸收部分台人充任，县市长之被人民反对者，当地县市参议会、“合法”团体等推举三人，由行政长官圈定一人充任，县市长及各级行政之“改革”，俟政府改组后决定。据中央社称：台省各地已渐趋平静，台南市火车由台籍人员主持，已于五日行驶。但陈仪广播中泄露各县市尚未完全恢复“秩序”。台人至六日尚乘坐卡车在路上收缴蒋军枪械，并谓台湾粮食问题极端严重，米已涨至六十元台币一斤（按一月初台北米价每斤台币十八元），合为蒋币则每斤由六百余元涨至二千余元，台湾大学学生已经吃了几天稀饭。
    【新华社延安七日电】上月二十六日台北讯：（迟到）台湾物价因受内地黄金美钞涨潮影响，一般物价陡涨逾一倍半，上涨之速，胜过日寇统治时期。蒋介石公布“紧急措施方案”之前，十四日台省当局即实行所谓“紧急管制法案”，禁止美钞买卖，并完全统治进出口贸易，扩大官僚资本垄断，促使物价继续上涨。工人因无法生活而卷入工潮者有专卖局之烟、酒，樟脑工厂，资源委员会之水泥肥料厂以及若干省营公司所属厂家，此一现象亦为日寇统治时期所未见。工商业均为蒋政府所垄断，民间商行、工厂纷纷准备歇业，小部分则改营小型工厂，制造铁皮、软木塞之类以苟延残喘。一般公务员每月薪给只有台币五千余元，合“法币”不过十八万元，因物价继续高涨，痛苦万状。
