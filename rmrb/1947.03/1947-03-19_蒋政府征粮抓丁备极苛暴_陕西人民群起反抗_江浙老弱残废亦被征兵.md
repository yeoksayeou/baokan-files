Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 15th: A dispatch from Xi'an: The grain levy and conscription in the KMT-controlled areas of Shaanxi are extremely harsh and brutal, and the people are rising up in resistance. Last year, the total amount of actual grain collected, borrowed provincial, county-level public grain, and arrears reached six million shi, exceeding the highest year during the War of Resistance Against Japan, which was four million five hundred thousand shi, by more than one-third. Since last winter, the Kuomintang's Party Headquarters, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Farmland and Food Bureau, and other organizations have jointly formed a "Grain Levy Supervision Team," cooperating with the Land Administration Department's fear of Jiang [Jieshi] and its insistence on perseverance. Chen Guliang, the director of the Social Affairs Department, and county-level officials went to the countryside to "supervise the collection." In Liquan, Xianyang, and other places, troops were stationed to urge the collection of grain. For households unable to pay the grain, a squad or several soldiers were stationed in their homes, forcing them to provide meals. In the southern part of Chang'an, Tibetan residents who owed grain were forced to wear paper hats and paraded through the streets. In Changwu, Guan, and Chengcheng, the grain collection personnel carried instruments of torture and iron rulers, searching door to door. If men fled, women and children were arrested and beaten on the palms of their hands. The Hengzhen Township Office detained two or thirty farmers who owed grain every day. In Pucheng, a pregnant woman gave birth while in custody. Farmers were forced to sell their land, cattle, and cotton at low prices to pay taxes. In the areas of Baibei and Jingyang, more than 90% of the farmers have no remaining grain at home. In the provincial and county areas, even many rich peasants are reduced to eating dougan, which is usually only used as horse feed.

The conscription situation, in addition to the conscription of soldiers for the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1946], also forces the conscription of "arrears" of conscripts from the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the areas of Baoji, Qishan, Pucheng, Baishui, Shiyi, and Lintong, conscription has been carried out three or four times since last autumn. In Lintong, 847 people were conscripted in one go. In addition to looting, conscripting, and grabbing, the people were also forced to pay money to buy conscripts. In Qishan, the price per person was as high as 2.5 million yuan. Hu Zongnan also used "inspection" and "training" to press-gang "self-defense forces" who did not leave production to Liquan. During the "inspection of the self-defense forces" in Tongguan, a large number of military uniforms were suddenly brought in and forced to be worn. Most of the conscripts scattered in a panic.

The people in various places, unwilling to be captured without a fight, rose up in resistance. The conscripts in Hongtu Town, Tongguan, were forced to guard blockhouses. As soon as they went upstairs, the guns of the guarding soldiers were confiscated, and all of them fled. Farmers in Chengcheng and Lintong killed grain collection commissioners. Farmers in Lintong killed the Bao headman who was collecting grain. Farmers in various places sent people to stand guard every day to avoid conscription and grain collection. Whenever they saw officials coming, they shouted "Alarm!" and everyone fled.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 15th: According to Shanghai newspapers: Recently, conscription tragedies have occurred everywhere in the KMT-controlled areas. The town head of a town in Xixian County, Henan, dragged away fifteen or sixteen-year-old primary school students from the school. The whole school was in an uproar, and they rushed to the town government to demand the release of the people. The town head ordered the local militia to open fire on the children, killing and wounding many people on the spot, and the ground was covered in blood. A farmer named Mei from Meijia Village, Tongshu District, Danyang, Jiangsu, to avoid military service for her son, stabbed him in both eyes with a needle, causing his eyes to swell like peaches, and he could no longer see the light of day. A small businessman from Nanchuan County, Sichuan, was conscripted into the army and escaped at an opportunity, but encountered an emergency conscription again. He was forced to become a madman. One night, his wife entered the room, and the businessman mistook her for a conscription officer and killed his wife. A Xia family's only son in Sanjiao Township, Jiangyin County, ran away during conscription and was chased by military police, jumping off a cliff to his death. An old man in Xiangqiao Township, Lintong, Shaanxi, had a son and was being pursued for conscription fees. Because he could not afford to pay, he said: "Don't worry, I can't guarantee whether this son will live or die!" The next day, his son died without any illness. The villagers said that the old man was forced to kill his own son. Furthermore, the Dagen District Office in Fuzhou dispatched a team late at night to arrest civil servant Wang Shiquan and rickshaw puller Sun Yongtian, and opened fire on the spot, wounding both Wang and Sun, and their lives were in danger.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 15th: According to Shanghai and Chongqing newspapers: The Jiang government's conscription has affected the weak and disabled. A hundred and twenty conscripts were sent from Chongming County, Jiangsu to Nantong a month ago. According to a reporter from the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, at least fifty of them were skinny or suffering from lung disease. There was also a middle-aged man with myopia of up to 800 degrees and a sallow complexion, one person limping, and two people blind in one eye. Shi Along, a disabled farmer from Jijing, Xiang Township, Pinghu, Zhejiang, was also conscripted into the "Conscription Office." After a medical examination by a military doctor, he was also deemed unqualified, but the conscription personnel extorted a gold ring and a dinner from his family, delaying his release until the escort. Shi Along was forced to hang himself. Luo Wenzhou, a tenant farmer from Tumen Township, Nanchong, Sichuan, had four of his five brothers conscripted during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Recently, Luo was abducted to the county town on the eve of his marriage. After examination, he was not abducted because of his short stature. However, the authorities extorted 400,000 yuan in "replacement fees," and poured feces into Luo's mouth, hung him up high, and whipped him. Luo fainted several times and attempted suicide many times without success.

　　蒋政府征粮抓丁备极苛暴
    陕西人民群起反抗
    江浙老弱残废亦被征兵
    【新华社延安十五日电】西安通讯：陕西蒋管区征粮征兵备极苛暴，人民纷起反抗。去年征实征借省县级公粮及积欠等，共达六百万石，较之抗战中最高一年四百五十万石尚超过三分之一。去冬以来，国民党的党部三青团、田粮处等合组“征粮督导团”，配合戊政厅畏蒋坚忍，社会处长陈固亮及县级官吏下乡“坐催”，醴泉，咸阳等地并派驻军催粮，对无力纳粮住户，派兵一班或数名驻其家中，迫令供餐。长安南乡给欠粮藏民戴上纸糊高帽子游街，长武、官、澄城催粮人员均带刑具铁尺，挨户搜索，男人逃走则捕押妇女小孩，并毒打妇女手心。横镇公所每天均拘欠粮农民二、三十人，蒲城一孕妇竟在拘押中呱呱产子，农民被迫贱卖田地耕牛及棉花，卖粮纳赋。湃北、泾阳一带，家无存粮之农户已达百分之九十以上。省县一带甚至许多富农亦告做马料的莞豆生活。
    其征兵情形除征三十五年度兵额外，尚迫征抗战中的壮丁“陈欠”靠县、歧山、蒲城、白水、释城、临潼一带去秋以来征兵三四次，临潼一次即征八百四十七名，征兵方式除抢、征、抓外，并勒令人民出钱购买壮丁，歧山每名买价高达二百五十万元。胡宗南且用“检阅”“训练”将不脱离生产的“自卫队”押赴醴泉；在同官“检阅自卫队”时，突然搬来大批军衣，迫令穿上，大半壮丁一哄而散。
    各地人民不甘束手待毙，群起反抗。同官红土镇壮丁被逼看守碉楼，刚一上楼即收缴看守士兵的枪械，全体逃散。澄县及临潼农民曾毙死征粮委员，临潼农民曾杀死征粮之保长，各地农民为避免征兵征粮每天派人放哨，凡见吏役到来即高喊“警报”，于是全体逃散。
    【新华社延安十五日电】据沪报消息：近来蒋区到处发生征兵惨剧，河南息县某镇镇长到小学校拉去十五六岁的小学生，全校学生大哗，涌至镇公所要求放人，镇长竟令乡丁开枪射击儿童，当场死伤多人，鲜血满地。江苏丹阳通墅区梅家村农民某，其母为免除兵役，用针刺彼双目，致该农民眼肿如桃，不能再见天日。四川南川县小商人某被征入伍，乘隙逃跑，又遇紧急征丁。被逼变成疯子。某夜其妻进房，该商人误为抓丁者竟杀其妻。江县属三角乡一夏姓独子，在抓丁时逃跑，被军警追赶，跳岩而死。陕西临潼象桥乡某村一老汉，有一儿子，被追征壮丁费时，因无力缴纳，他说：“你不要忙，我这子不保险死活呢”！次日其子便无疾而死，村民都说老汉被逼杀死亲儿。又福州市大根区公所，深夜派队捕抓公务员王世泉，拉车孙永天，当场开枪射击，王、孙均受伤，生命危殆。
    【新华社延安十五日电】据沪渝报纸消息：蒋政府之征兵殃及赢弱残废，江苏崇明县月前送壮丁一百二十名赴南通，据沪大公报记者访察结果，其中骨瘦如柴或患肺病者至少有五十人，且有一中年人眼睛近视达八百度，面呈菜色，有一人行路迹蹶，有二人眇一目。浙江平湖湘属羁泾农民施阿龙，身体残废，亦被征送“征集所”，后经军医检查亦认为不合格，但征兵人员勒索其家交金戒指一枚及招待酒食，拖延不放，直至起解，施阿龙被迫自缢身死。四川南充土门乡佃农罗文周弟兄五人，抗战中被征兵四人，最近罗又在结婚前夕被绑走县城，经检验以身体短小未绑走，但当局于勒索“请替费”四十万元遂，竟以大粪灌入罗口，被高吊鞭打，昏厥数次，罗屡次自杀未成。
