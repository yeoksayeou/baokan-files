　　[This dispatch from Taihang on the 17th] The border areas of the Third District of Huixian County are vigorously promoting land reform in conjunction with the suppression of special agents. Last October, the Chiang army briefly infiltrated the area, which impacted the emancipation movement, but it soon resumed with great fanfare. Peasants in villages three to five *li* away from the enemy are also carrying out the emancipation movement under armed protection. The land reform movement in this district is being conducted in three types of villages: in the first type of villages, the land issue has been resolved relatively thoroughly, and now the focus is on further mobilizing those who are lagging behind; conducting ideological education to draw clear class lines and dig out "air-raid shelters"; the second type of villages is continuing thorough liquidations in conjunction with the suppression of special agents, such as in Panzi Village, where eight hidden guns were exposed, and the masses have been freed from the threat of hidden guns, leading to a surge in the fighting spirit. The seven villages in the border area are also carrying out emancipation while fighting under the slogan of armed protection of land and conscription. According to preliminary statistics from fifteen villages in this district, peasants have recovered more than 2,000 *mu* of land, over 700 rooms, and a large number of livestock and clothing from the hands of local tyrants and evil landlords.

　　辉县三区边地实行土地改革
    【本报太行十七日电】辉县三区边地结合反特大力推行土地改革。去年十月蒋军一度窜入，翻身运动受到影响，不久即又轰轰烈烈的搞起来了。距敌三、五里村庄的农民，亦在武装保卫下大闹翻身。该区的土地改革运动，系分三类村进行：一类村土地问题已得到较彻底的解决，现正继续深入发动落后；进行思想教育，划清阶级，挖“防空洞”；二类村是结合反特继续大清算，如盘子等村即斗出黑枪八支，群众解除了黑枪的威胁，斗争情绪十分高涨。边沿区七个村亦在武装保田保丁的口号下，一面作战一面翻身。现据该区十五个村的初步统计：农民由恶霸地主手中已收回之土地二千余亩，房七百余间及牲口衣服等甚多。
