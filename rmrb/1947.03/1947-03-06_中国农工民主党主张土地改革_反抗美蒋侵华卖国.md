　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. Shanghai News: The China National Democratic League issued a declaration on the 3rd of last month, putting forward four propositions: (1) We firmly believe that the realization of socialism in China must go through the development of democratic politics. Today, the most urgent need of the Chinese people is to obtain democracy. For this reason, our party fully agrees with the political program of the Democratic League and its countermeasures to the current situation. All party members participating in the Democratic League must indeed abide by the resolutions of the Democratic League and strive to realize its propositions. (2) The worker-peasant masses organized by our party will unite with the workers and peasants of the whole country to carry out a common struggle to seek their own liberation. (3) Our party has consistently advocated that the transformation of China's economy at the present stage must first improve the lives of farmers, realize land to the tillers, increase workers' welfare, let workers participate in production management, and cooperate with industrialists and businessmen to develop production. The current task is to stop conscription and grain requisition to seek rural stability; to stop inflation and the monopoly of bureaucratic compradors to seek the revival of industry and commerce and the relief of unemployment. (4) The Chinese national liberation movement could have been completed in the war of resistance against Japan, but the ruling party's use of foreign aid to carry out civil war has destroyed its achievements. US imperialism has deepened its penetration, and we are determined to resist it, ensure national independence and autonomy, and jointly maintain human peace and happiness with the democratic forces of the world, so as to prevent China from becoming a world battlefield.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. Shanghai News: The China National Democratic League (Third Party) held its Fourth National Cadre Conference in Shanghai on January 16. Thirty-seven representatives attended the meeting. The meeting passed a resolution to formally change the name of the "Chinese National Liberation Action Committee" (Third Party) to the "China National Democratic League", and revised the party constitution, setting November 29 this year for the convening of the First National Congress of Party Members. The meeting decided that the party fully agreed with the political program of the Democratic League, and that members of the party participating in the Democratic League should faithfully abide by the resolutions of the Democratic League and be willing to strive to realize the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the program of peaceful national construction. The meeting formally elected Zhang Bojun, Qiu Zhe, Guo Guanjie, Li Boqiu, Yang Bokai and other thirty-three people as members of the Central Executive Committee of the party, and Peng Zemin and other fifteen people as members of the Central Supervisory Committee. The party was founded in September 1930, initially named "Chinese Kuomintang Provisional Action Committee", and reorganized into "Chinese National Liberation Action Committee" in 1935.

    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：中国农工民主党上月三日发表宣言，提出四项主张：（１）吾人深信中国社会主义之实现，必须经过民主政治之发展，今日中国人民急切之需要首在获得民主。职此之故，本党完全同意民主同盟的政治纲领及其时局对策，凡本党党员参加民盟者，均须确实鸟守民盟决议，为实现其主张而奋斗。（２）本党所组织之农工平民群众，党与全国工农结成联合力量，进行共同的斗争，以求自身的解放。（３）本党对于现阶段中国经济之改造，一贯主张首须改善农民生活，实现耕者有其田，增进工人福利，由工人参加生产管理，并与工商业者一致合作，以发展生产。当前之任务，则在于停止征兵、征粮，求农村之安定；停止通货膨胀及官僚买办之垄断，求工商业之复兴与失业之救济。（４）中国民族解放运动本可完成于抗日之役，然而以当权政党的利用外援进行内战而自毁其功，美帝国主义遂益加深入，吾人誓必加以抵抗，确保国家的独立自主，以与世界民主力量共同维护人类之和平幸福，而免致中国沦为世界的战场。
