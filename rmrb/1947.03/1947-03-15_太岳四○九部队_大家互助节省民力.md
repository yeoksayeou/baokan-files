　　Taiyue 409 Troops
    Everyone Helps Each Other to Save Civilian Labor
    [Taiyue, 13th dispatch] When the 409 Troops set out recently, both officers and soldiers paid special attention to cherishing civilian labor. On the second day of the march, superiors saw that civilian laborers from Wangwu were carrying bombs, so they quickly ordered the bombs to be distributed to the soldiers of the battalion. Every comrade said very happily: "No problem, we can each carry five more, we definitely don't need the villagers to follow and deliver them!" So, some took three, some took five, and they were immediately snatched up. Comrade Shi Zhongshui, a probationary combat staff officer, had a very bad case of scabies, but he insisted on not using a stretcher when climbing mountains. When Political Commissar Zhang was climbing a mountain, he saw that the cook, Zhang Ruisheng, was small in stature but was carrying a large marching pot, so he immediately took it upon himself to carry it for him for four or five li of mountain road. Comrade Tang Jun, the head of the propaganda and education section, also carried a gun for a soldier of the 1st Company for a whole day. Under the concept of cherishing civilian labor, everyone used mutual assistance to solve the difficulty of using less civilian labor.

　　太岳四○九部队
    大家互助节省民力
    【太岳十三日电】四○九部队，在最近出发时，不论干部战士都特别注意爱惜民力。行军的第二天，上级看到了王屋参战民夫担着炸弹，就很快叫把炸弹分给营的战士们担。每个同志都非常高兴的说：“不成问题，我们每个人多带上五个就行了，保必叫老乡跟着送呢？”于是你拿三个，我拿五个，马上就抢完了。见习作战参谋史中水同志，疥疮生得很厉害，爬山过岭始终不要担架。张政委在爬山时，看到炊事员张瑞生长的个子很小，却背了一个大行军锅，他马上就替他背上爬了四五里山路。宣教股长汤骏同志也给一连一个战士整整背了一天的枪。大家在爱惜民力的观念下，用互助的办法以解决少用民力的困难。
