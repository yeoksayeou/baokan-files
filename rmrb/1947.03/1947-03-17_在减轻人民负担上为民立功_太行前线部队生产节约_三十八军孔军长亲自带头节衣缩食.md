Performing Meritorious Service for the People by Reducing Their Burden
Taihang Frontline Troops Engage in Production and Thrift
38th Army Commander Kong Takes the Lead in Austerity
[This dispatch from Taihang, dated the 15th] The Taihang front-line troops are launching a production and thrift campaign. On March 1st, the Frontline Political Department of the Military Region held a soldiers' meeting in a village at the front, mobilizing for production and thrift. All cadres and soldiers responded enthusiastically, unanimously believing that they should not only perform meritorious service for the people in combat, but also in overcoming financial difficulties and reducing the burden on the people. They immediately signed up to save all or part of their entitled clothing and allowances. Comrade Yang Kaiqiang, an assistant, also handed over 10,000 yuan of savings accumulated from years of labor and production. The department saved a total of 35 cotton-padded coats and trousers, 22 single-layer coats and trousers, 32 hats, 83 pairs of shoes and socks, 39 towels, and 270 jin of allowance rice. Production has been discussed, and a plan is being drafted. Due to frequent wars at the front, cadres will engage in cooperative production with the department's rear personnel. Correspondents, cooks, and others have already begun production activities such as collecting firewood and sprouting soybeans.
[Special dispatch from this newspaper] Kong, the commander of the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, and Liu, the deputy commander, telegraphed to the two divisions under their command in mid-February to promote production and thrift. They also convened all personnel from the army's directly subordinate units and the 164th Regiment to personally mobilize them, requesting everyone to practice austerity, save expenses, and minimize the burden on the public. In the absence of a production base and production experience, they actively sought ways to learn production skills, so that "the difficulties of each unit can be solved by the production of each unit, and the individual difficulties can be solved by individuals." Commander Kong announced on the spot: "1. This year, I will save two pairs of shoes and one towel, and I will wear old cotton-padded clothes in winter without receiving new ones; 2. The habit of drinking alcohol for the past 20 years will now be completely abandoned; 3. Since a ping-pong ball is expensive at 400 yuan, the ping-pong activity will be changed to Tai Chi; 4. Drinking tea will be changed to drinking boiled water, and no cigarettes will be offered to guests." After announcing his savings measures, he asked everyone to correct the concept of "officials being extravagant" and not cherishing public property. Subsequently, Deputy Commander Liu and Chief of Staff Wang also announced their personal savings plans. After mobilization and discussion, all units directly under the army formulated specific plans for each unit and individual. Currently, in terms of production, sprouting soybeans, grinding tofu, and raising pigs have been widely implemented in various units, and small-scale cooperatives and transportation production have been organized. All catering units plan to grow their own vegetables for self-sufficiency. In terms of savings, each unit plans to save 20% to 40% on office supplies. The army's directly subordinate units, totaling more than 300 people, have saved 117 pairs of shoes, 67 pairs of socks, 90 towels, 5 sets of cotton army uniforms, 1 set of single army uniforms, 2 extra trousers, 3 pairs of cotton shoes, 360 jin of food rice, and 678 jin of allowance rice. Many cadres and soldiers in the communications platoon have quit smoking or switched to smoking dry tobacco according to their personal plans.
The army lacks transportation capacity, so in order to save civilian labor, all cadres and soldiers participate in carrying grain. Furthermore, the army's training team has expanded its training in this period. At the opening ceremony a few days ago, Commander Kong specifically proposed to combine learning with actual life, and to carry out production labor as much as possible in the gaps of learning, in order to establish a labor concept and promote a spirit of hard struggle.

    该军运输力缺乏，为了节省民力，全体干部战士，一律参加背粮。又该军教导队本期扩大训练，日前开学典礼上，孔军长特提出要把学习和实际生活结合起来，尽量在学习空隙进行生产劳动，以建立劳动观念和发扬艰苦奋斗的作风。
