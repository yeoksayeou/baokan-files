　　【Our News】The North China Xinhua Bookstore's Distribution Department recently held a departmental meeting to determine how to expand distribution work so that cadres in all areas have books to read. The specific methods are as follows: (1) Support cultural cooperatives in various counties so that they can undertake cultural and educational work in a county. (2) In counties without cultural cooperatives, send special personnel to assist in establishing them, with the minimum standard being that publications can be distributed to every county. (3) In addition to establishing consignment relationships between the wholesale division and various regions, the distribution department should improve the mail-order organization, expand mail-order readers, and reserve a portion of books so that readers in remote areas can purchase them at any time. (4) Publications should primarily target cadres, and reasonable allocation should be carried out so that cadres at or above the county level have books to read. In addition, they have now overcome the past shortcomings of various branches completing production tasks by selling stationery, which affected distribution. It is proposed that managing stationery should be one of the bookstore's political tasks, ensuring the supply of readers' needs. It is stipulated that all stationery profits should go to the general store, and the branches' living expenses should be reimbursed to the general store according to the supply system (previously reimbursed from stationery production).

　　华北新华书店研究改进发行
    【本报讯】华北新华书店发行科顷举行科务会议，确定扩大发行工作，使各地干部有书可读。具体办法如下：（一）扶持各县文化合作社，使能担任一县的文化教育工作。（二）没有文化合作社的县份，当派专人协助建立，以出版物能发行到每个县为起码标准。（三）除批发股和各地建立代售关系外，发行科应健全邮购组织，扩大邮购读者并留存一部书籍，以便远地读者随时购买。（四）出版物以干部为主要对象，进行合理分配，使县级以上干部都有书可读。此外，他们现已克服了过去各分店以经营文具来完成生产任务，而影响发行的缺点。提出经营文具当为书店的政治任务之一，保证供应读者需要，规定文具盈利全部归总店，分店生活费按供给制向总店报销（过去由文具生产中报销）。
