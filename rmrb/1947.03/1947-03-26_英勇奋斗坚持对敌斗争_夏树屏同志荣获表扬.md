(This newspaper, Jilu Yu dispatched on the 24th) The Puyang County Committee recently commended Comrade Xia Shuping for his outstanding achievements in persisting in guerrilla warfare and war support work, and called for the development of the Xia Shuping movement. The County Committee pointed out that Comrade Xia Shuping has the following advantages: (1) He does whatever the revolution needs him to do. He goes wherever it is arduous, difficult, and dangerous, and without any complaints. (2) He is brave, resourceful, and not afraid of sacrifice. In the most dangerous environments, he can decisively determine the direction and come up with solutions. (3) He is good at contacting the masses and uniting cadres. He is tolerant, not impatient, and persists in principled struggle.

Note: Comrade Xia Shuping is the ×× Minister of Puyang. Since working in the area in 1939, he has actively served the people for eight or nine years. He has been tested in struggle. The Party and the people believe that he is truly a meritorious servant of the people and a model for cadres. In 1939, Xia Shuping launched a mass anti-Japanese movement in his village. During the enemy's "May 5th" major mopping-up operation in 1940, and from 1941 to 1945 when the enemy occupied Puyang, no matter how the environment changed or how arduous it was, he always fought guerrillas with the people of Puyang under the leadership of the Puyang Party, and never left. Last July, when Chiang Kai-shek's army launched a massive offensive against the people of Jilu Yu, he actively led the people in self-defense. During the Dayang Lake and Longfeng battles, Comrade Shuping successively brought 800 and 500 stretchers, braving the rain, wading through water, and plunging into the mud, persisting in frontline work under enemy plane strafing. During the Juan'nan battle, Comrade Shuping repeatedly mobilized the people, living and enduring hardships with the stretcher bearers every day, and even allowed the sick to ride his livestock. He personally carried three wounded soldiers off the front line. When he saw someone tired of carrying, he would take their place. Under his influence, the task of 150 stretchers was completed. After completing the task of carrying 43 wounded soldiers on one occasion, he saw that there were still wounded soldiers on the battlefield who needed to be carried away, so he took the lead, calling out: "Those who have the courage, follow me!" He eventually carried the remaining wounded soldiers back. He often encouraged everyone, saying: "Carry the stretchers faster. The more sweat we shed, the less blood the comrades will shed." On November 29th last year, Chiang Kai-shek's army attacked Puyang. That night, Comrade Shuping and six comrades hid in a tunnel in a village. Coincidentally, the enemy was cutting trees in the village to build fortifications. On the morning of the 30th, the tunnel was shaken open by the tree cutting, but the enemy did not notice. However, some comrades began to panic. Comrade Shuping said to everyone: "Comrades, the time has come for Communist Party members to bravely and resolutely sacrifice themselves for the people. We cannot let the enemy capture us alive!" Then he organized everyone to make final preparations, tearing up documents and burying the seals and pens. On the evening of the 30th, the enemy determined that there were people in the tunnel and began to search. At this time, he nervously used an iron shovel to open another entrance, and after killing two enemies, broke through. On December 1st, he met up with the evacuated militia and formed a small guerrilla team with 30 militiamen and cadres, and they started fighting. Now this guerrilla team is growing stronger day by day.

    英勇奋斗坚持对敌斗争
    夏树屏同志荣获表扬
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】濮阳县委会顷表扬坚持游击战争与战勤工作有显著成绩的夏树屏同志，并号召开展夏树屏运动。县委会指出夏树屏同志有如下优点：（１）革命需要他做啥，他就做啥。那里艰苦困难危险，他就到那里去，而且毫无怨言。（２）勇敢、机警不怕牺牲。在最危险的环境中，他能果断为决定方向，想出办法。（３）他善于联系群众，团结干部。他能忍让，不急燥，坚持原则斗争。
    按：夏树屏同志是濮阳的××部长。从一九三九年在该地工作以来，积极为人民服务，八、九年如一日。在斗争中经过考验。党与人民认为他确是人民的功臣，干部的榜样。三九年，夏树屏在本庄内掀起群众抗日运动，四○年敌人“五五”大扫荡，和四一至四五年敌人侵占濮阳，无论环境怎样变化，怎样艰苦，他在濮阳党的领导下，一直和濮阳人民在一起打游击，从未离开过。去年七月蒋军大举向冀鲁豫人民进攻，他更积极领导人民进行自卫。大杨湖和龙凤两战役时，树屏同志先后带了八百和五百付担架，冒着雨，淌水插泥，在敌机扫射下，坚持前方工作。鄄南战役时，树屏同志再三深入动员，每天与担架民夫同生活，共艰苦，他的牲口也让病号骑。他在火线上亲自背下三个彩号，他看见谁抬得疲劳，便替谁抬。这样在他影响下，完成了一百五十付担架的任务。某次抬了四十三个彩号完成任务后，他看见战场还有彩号，必须抬下来，就以身作则，号召说：“有胆的再跟我来。”终将留下的彩号抬回。他常鼓励大家说：“抬担架要走快点，我们多流一点汗，同志们就少流一点血。”去年十一月廿九日，蒋军进攻了濮阳，当晚，树屏同志在某村即带六个同志钻了地洞。恰巧敌人在该村砍树修鹿砦，三十号上午即因砍树把地道震开，但敌人并未注意，可是个别同志开始着慌，树屏同志对大家说：“同志们，共产党员英勇果敢为人民牺牲的时候到了。我们不能叫敌人捉活的呀！”接着便组织大家作最后准备，文件撕了，手章钢笔埋了。三十号晚上，敌人断定洞中有人，就开始搜索。这时他紧张地用铁铲将另一个洞口铲开，打死了两个敌人以后突围出来。十二月一号，他与转移的民兵会合了。带着三十个民兵和干部，组成一支小游击队，就干起来，现在这支游击队一已天天壮大起来。
