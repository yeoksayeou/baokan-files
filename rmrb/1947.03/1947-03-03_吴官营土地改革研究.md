　　Research on Land Reform in Wuguan Village
    Yang Zhenya et al. Investigation, Lin Wei Arrangement
    Wuguan Village is an advanced village in Jize County, Southern Hebei. Before the war, there were five landlords owning 300 mu, 200 mu, and 150 mu of land respectively. After mass movements such as rent reduction, debt repayment, increased investment, land redemption, and anti-corruption since 1942, some land had been recovered by the peasants. In order to reduce their targets, avoid burdens, and fight against the masses, the landlords sold off land in large quantities, split up their families, and became rich peasants or well-to-do middle peasants. Although poor and hired peasants had redeemed and calculated the return of more than three qing of land from the landlords in 1942, because it was not distributed at that time, but the land belonged to the original owners, many landless and land-poor peasants still did not get land. Before the land reform in September last year, the land ownership of each class in the village was as follows: 10 households renting out land, 25 people, 8.1 mu of land per person; 29 rich peasant households, 117 people, 8.4 mu of land per person; 60 well-to-do middle peasant households, 265 people, 6.1 mu of land per person; 76 middle peasant households, 297 people, 5.7 mu of land per person; 56 lower-middle peasant households, 238 people, 4.9 mu of land per person; 47 poor peasant households, 167 people, 3.9 mu of land per person; 3 destitute households, 12 people, 1.4 mu of land per person. The whole village had 281 households, 1122 people, and 6333 mu of land.
    Judging from the quantity alone, the ratio of land per person between the rich and the poor is 6.1 to 7.1. Judging from the quality, it is even more than this number. Because good land was continuously retained by the landlords who had split up their families (who have become well-to-do middle peasants from the perspective of production relations), or bought by other rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. Lower-middle peasants, especially poor and hired peasants, mostly had bad land.
    According to this situation, land reform is still an urgent issue. But who are the targets of the land reform struggle—the feudal forces? Let's first study the ten households in the village who rent out land.
    Among these ten households, only Wu Liao's household owns 60 mu of land and rents out 30 mu (before the war, they were landlords with more than one qing of land). The remaining two households are military martyr families and widowed elderly households who have long been in decline and now have about 20 mu of land; five households were middle peasants before the war, but now lack labor and rent out only a dozen mu of land; and the other two households are hiring laborers and renting the land to their employers. It can be seen here that except for Wu Liao's household, the others are not targets of struggle. And this household only has 60 mu of land, which cannot solve the problem. However, among the 29 rich peasant households, about 20 were landlords before the war, who cruelly exploited and oppressed the peasants, and some of them were secret agents, had been traitors, and local bullies. They own many good lands exceeding the average and live the wealthiest lives. Therefore, if we mobilize the peasants to rise up to avenge their grievances, settle historical accounts, eliminate feudalism, and implement land to the tiller, the main targets of struggle must be these 20 or so households, and only by overthrowing them can the poor and hired peasants obtain land.
    In the land reform in the village, in accordance with the county party committee's policy and the demands of the masses, a thorough liquidation and struggle was carried out against seven former traitorous bully landlords (now secret agents) and one current landlord household (Wu Liao's household), allowing the masses to vent their anger and recover about 100 mu of good land. We also launched a campaign to demand debts from seven landlords who had been liquidated in the past but had not returned enough land, and recovered land; in addition, we also recovered the hidden land from five old declining landlord households. These twelve households produced more than 100 mu of land, all of which were distributed to the masses. However, these 200 mu of land alone cannot solve the problem. Even according to the minimum requirement of one mu per poor peasant and two mu per destitute peasant, it would require about 200 mu. If we want to turn them into middle peasants and give a little to the poorest households among the middle peasants, then we would need 300 mu of land. Therefore, the leadership called on the masses to help each other to help poor brothers turn over, with the slogan of "Everyone has land to cultivate, enough land to cultivate." After the masses brewed it themselves, they all felt that this mutual aid method was very good. The deputy village chief and a cadre's family took the lead in giving up land, and then 18 rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants responded. A total of 20 households gave up 80 to 90 mu of land. Among them, except for the two households that took the lead, they generally thought "this is a good thing" and took this as an honor. Among them, 13 households also had too little labor and could not cultivate too much land. They were willing to cultivate less and better, and the leadership greatly praised this spirit of mutual aid and friendship. Therefore, the whole village showed unprecedented unity and active atmosphere after giving up the land.
    This method did not affect their lives. For example, Zhou Guantang's family of two had 23 mu of land, gave up 5.5 mu, and now each person still gets 8.5 dan of yield. Chen Dongchang's family of two had 21 mu of land, gave up 4 mu, and now each person gets 8 dan of yield. The output per person of other land-giving households is still above 5 dan and 6 dan. Two households with an average of about 4 dan are even wealthier than others because they have strong labor and the actual grain received exceeds the yield.
    The main force and backbone of the land reform movement in Wuguan Village were the poor peasants. They played a pioneer role in the struggle and also did a good job in uniting the middle peasants, so there was no rift between the middle and poor peasants before the voluntary land giving. (1) They discussed in detail all those who volunteered to give up land. Those who should not be accepted (such as those with labor) were tactfully rejected, and their friendly spirit was praised. Some cadres accepted them at the time, but after the final mass discussion, those who were considered inappropriate were returned separately. (2) The distribution of fruits was wide, making everyone satisfied. Those who received fruits in the village accounted for more than 70% of the total number of households. Even 30 well-to-do middle peasant households received money.
    After meticulous distribution of land and other fruits, everyone in the village now has more than three mu of standard land (one dan of yield per mu). The current land ownership of each class is as follows: 7 widowed elderly households renting out land, 18 people, 6 mu of land per person; 4 rich peasant households, 16 people, 9.6 mu of land per person; 87 well-to-do middle peasant households, 362 people, 6.3 mu of land per person; 117 middle peasant households, 504 people, 5.5 mu of land per person; 50 lower-middle peasant households, 182 people, 4.7 mu of land per person; 16 poor peasant households, 40 people, 3.9 mu of land per person.
    On the surface, the amount of land still seems disparate. In fact, those with more average land mostly have less labor or are widowed elderly, and are specially taken care of, but their actual lives are not stronger than middle-class households. Those with less land either have less labor and are unwilling to have more, but are willing to cultivate the land well and produce more grain, exceeding the yield. Others can leach salt and feel that leaching salt is more profitable and are unwilling to cultivate more land.
    Two experiences of land reform in Wuguan Village:
    1. Resolutely liquidate landlords and local bullies who changed their components by splitting up their families, and let them spit out their stolen goods.
    2. In some areas, after eliminating feudalism, the land problem of poor and hired peasants cannot be solved. If the masses have a high level of awareness and mutual assistance to turn over becomes a common opinion, some well-to-do middle peasants may sincerely and voluntarily give up part of their land to help poor brothers. We should praise this spirit of friendship and allow them to do so, and should not think that peasants can never improve and can never voluntarily give up land. The reality of Wuguan Village proves this point. What the leadership should do is: truly regard "mutual assistance and mutual concession, everyone turns over" as the masses' own slogan, and organize cadres and activists to take the lead and create a mass movement to fill in the gaps.

　　吴官营土地改革研究
    杨振亚等调查  林韦整理
    吴官营是冀南鸡泽县一个先进村。战前拥有三百亩、二百亩、百五十亩不等的五家地主，经过四二年以后减租、还债、增资、赎地、反贪污等群众运动，已有一部分土地被农民收回。地主为缩小目标，逃避负担与群众斗争，大批出卖土地、分家，变成富农或富裕中农。而贫雇农虽四二年向地主赎回与算回三顷多地，但因当时不是分配，而是地归原主，所以有不少无地少地农民仍未获得土地。去年九月土地改革前该村各阶层占有土地情形如下：出租土地的十户，二五口，每人土地八·一亩；富农二九户，一一七口，每人土地八·四亩；富裕中农六十户，二六五口，每人土地六·一亩；中农七六户，二九七口，每人土地五·七亩；下中农五六户，二三八口，每人土地四·九亩；贫农四七户，一六七口，每人土地三·九亩；赤贫三户，十二口，每人土地一·四亩。全村共二八一户，一一二二口，地六三三三亩。
    光从数量看，贫富每人土地为六与一到七与一之比。从质量看，则又不止此数。因为好地都被分了家的地主（从生产关系看已成了富裕中农）继续保有，或被其他富农与富裕中农买去。下中农、特别贫雇农，则多是坏地。
    根据这个情况，土地改革仍是迫切问题。但土地改革的斗争对象——封建势力是那些人呢？这儿先把该村出租土地的十户研究一下。
    这十户中，只吴寥氏一户拥有六十亩地，出租三十亩（战前为一顷多地地主）。其余有两户是早已没落，现有二十亩左右土地的军烈属孤寡户；有五户是战前中农，现无劳力而出租，都只十多亩地；另有两户是雇工出租给雇主。这儿看出，除吴寥氏外，其他均非斗争对象。而这一户也只有六十亩地。不能解决问题。可是富农二十九户中，却有二十来户是战前地主，对农民进行过残酷的剥削压迫，其中一部分是特务、又曾是汉奸、恶霸。他们拥有超过平均数的许多好地，过着最富裕生活。所以，我们发动农民起来报仇报冤，算历史账，消灭封建，实行耕者有其田，主要的斗争对象必然是这二十来户，也只有斗倒他们才能使贫雇农获得土地。
    该村土地改革中，依照县委的方针与群众的要求，对七个旧日的奸霸地主（如今是特务）和一户现在的地主（吴寥氏）进行了彻底的清算与斗争，让群众把气出透，收回好地一百来亩。又向七户过去清算过而未退够的地主展开要账，索还土地；另有五户老下降地主，也将其隐蔽土地索回，这十二户，又弄出百多亩，全部分给群众。但是，光这二百多亩地还解决不了问题。即按最低要求，贫农每人填一亩，赤贫每人填二亩，也得二百来亩，若想把他们变为中农，并给中农中最贫苦的户填一点，那就得有三百亩地。于是领导上号召群众互助互让来帮助穷苦弟兄翻身，口号是要做到人人有地种，地够种。经过群众自己酝酿，都觉得这种互助办法很好。副村长和一户干属挑头让地，接着就有十八户富农与富裕中农起来响应。共二十户，让出土地八、九十亩。他们之中，除挑头两户外，一般都认为“这是件好事”，并以此为光荣。其中有十三户是劳动力也太少，种不了太多的地。愿意种少些、种好些、领导上大大表扬了这种互助友爱精神，所以让地后全村表现了空前的团结与活跃空气。
    这办法并没影响他们的生活，比如：周关堂家人二口，原有地二十三亩，让出五亩半，现每人仍合八石五产量。陈冬长家人二口，原有地二十一亩，让出四亩，现每人合产量八石。其他让地户，每人产量均仍在五石、六石以上。有两个平均四石左右的，其生活比别的还富裕。因劳动力强，实收粮均超过产量。
    吴官营土地改革运动中的主力骨干是贫农，他们在斗争中起了先锋作用，并在团结中农上同样做得很好，所以未因自动让地前发生中、贫之间裂痕。（一）他们对自动让地者都经过详细讨论，认为不应接受的（如有劳力的），即婉言谢绝，并表扬其友爱精神，有些当时干部接受了，经最后群众讨论，认为不妥者，都分别退回。（二）分果实面宽，做到了大家都满意，该村分得果实者占总户数百分之七十以上。连富裕中农也有三十户得到钱财。
    经过细密分配土地与其他果实，该村现每个人都有了三亩以上标准地（每亩产量一石）。现在各阶层土地占有状况如下：孤寡出租土地者七户人十八口，每人土地六亩；富农四户人十六口，每人土地九·六亩；富裕中农八七户人三六二口，每人土地六·三亩；中农一一七户人五○四口，每人土地五·五亩；下中农五十户人一八二口，每人土地四·七亩；贫农十六户人四十口，每人土地三·九亩。
    表面看来，土地数量似仍悬殊。其实是：平均土地多者，多是劳力少，或为孤寡，特意照顾，其实际生活不比中等户强。土地少的，有因自己劳力少，不愿多要，而愿把地种好，多打粮食，超过产量。其他则是有些会淋盐的，觉得淋盐利大，不愿多种地。
    吴官营土地改革的两点经验：
    一、对分家以改变成份的地主恶霸坚决清算，让他们吐出赃物来。
    二、有的地区在消灭封建之后，还不能解决贫雇农土地问题时，如果群众觉悟高，互助翻身成了普遍舆论，有些富裕中农是可能真心真意自愿让出一部分土地来帮助穷苦弟兄的，我们应该表扬这种友爱精神，允许他们这样做，不可认为农民就永不能提高，永不能自愿让地，吴官营的实际，正说明这点。领导上应做的是：把“互助互让，人人翻身”真正作为群众自己口号，并组织干部积极分子出来带头，造成群众性的填平补齐运动。
