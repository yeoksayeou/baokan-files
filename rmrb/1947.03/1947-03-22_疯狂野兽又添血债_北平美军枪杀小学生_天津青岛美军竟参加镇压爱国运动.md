Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Recently, American troops stationed in China have directly participated in the Chiang Kai-shek government's suppression of the Chinese people's patriotic and democratic movement in Tianjin and Qingdao. American military police are cooperating with Chiang Kai-shek's military police to arrest Chinese people. According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 16th, it has been learned here that large-scale arrests of progressive Chinese people and Chinese people who oppose American policies towards China are being carried out in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. It is reported that over 5,000 people have been arrested in Qingdao alone, and 2,000 in Tianjin. The searches and arrests are being jointly carried out by Chinese and American military police. Some industrial and commercial enterprises of Soviet citizens in Tianjin have also been searched. The participation of American military police in the searches and arrests has particularly aroused the anger of the Chinese people.
