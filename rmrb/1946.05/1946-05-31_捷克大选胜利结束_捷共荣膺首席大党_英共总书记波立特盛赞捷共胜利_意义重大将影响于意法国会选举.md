　　Czech Elections End in Victory
    Czech Communist Party Becomes Leading Party
    British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt Praises Czech Communist Party Victory as Highly Significant, Will Influence Italian and French Parliamentary Elections
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 28th] Prague dispatch: The Czech elections have ended in victory, and the Czech Communist Party has become the leading party in the country. According to figures released by Czech officials on the 27th, the Communist Party received a total of over 2,695,000 votes in the Constitutional Assembly elections, double that of the second-largest party, the National Socialist Party (to which President Beneš originally belonged). The results for each province are as follows: In the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia (Czech), the Communist Party is in the lead, with 2,205,658 votes; the National Socialist Party, 1,198,967 votes; the Catholic People's Party, 1,100,920 votes; and the Social Democratic Party, 855,779 votes. In Slovakia, the Communist Party is second, with 490,257 votes; the Catholic Democratic Party, 989,275 votes (Note: the above six parties are parties of the National Front); the Liberal Party, 67,575 votes; and the Labor Party, 49,993 votes. The total number of blank votes does not exceed one percent. British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt told a United Press reporter in London that "the significance of the Czech Communist Party's victory in this election will greatly influence the parliamentary elections in Italy and France, which are to be held on June 2nd." He also said that the Czech election results prove that "the progressive and democratic socio-economic reform policies pursued by the Czech National Front since the liberation of Czechoslovakia have been successful."
