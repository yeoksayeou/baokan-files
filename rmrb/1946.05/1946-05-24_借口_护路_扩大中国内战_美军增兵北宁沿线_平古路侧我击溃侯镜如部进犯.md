    American Troops Reinforce the Beining Railway Line
    Our Forces Repulse Hou Jingru's Advancing Troops on the Pinggu Road Side
    [New China News Agency, Zunhua, 20th] Since mid-May, American troops along the Beining Railway, using the pretext of "protecting transportation," have reinforced their forces between Tangshan and Kaiping by more than 500 men. A portion of the American troops in Qinhuangdao has also moved to Fengtai Station, west of Changli, to increase defenses, totaling more than 1,200 men. The original 400 American troops stationed in Tangshan have increased the number of American troops stationed at each fortress bridge between Beiping and Tangshan by 23 men. Within 20 li of the outskirts of Tangshan, there are even two or three American military trucks patrolling day and night. In recent days, military vehicles on the Ping-Shen Road have been frequent, and the Kuomintang army, under the protection of the American army, is continuing to transport troops to the Northeast to expand the civil war.
    [New China News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 20th] Jidong News: (Delayed) At 4:00 AM on the 19th of last month, more than 2,000 men from the Kuomintang 92nd Army under Hou Jingru, stationed in Miyun, Huairou, and Gaoliying along the Pinggu Road, led by Tan Ming, deputy head of the 116th Regiment, carrying eight mortars and more than twenty heavy machine guns, attached with three cars, attacked the defensive positions of the People's Liberation Army in Qiaozicun and Fengshanling. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, fighting fiercely for a day and night. By 10:00 AM the next morning, the Kuomintang army had completely collapsed, Qiaozicun was regained, and the Kuomintang army suffered more than 400 casualties below the rank of the 6th Company Commander of the 116th Regiment. Seven large trucks and one car were used to transport the dead bodies. Thirty-one bodies were abandoned. Our side also suffered more than 70 casualties below the rank of platoon leader. According to reports, since the ceasefire order came into effect on January 14, the Hou Jingru's forces along the Pinggu Road have never stopped encroaching and attacking the Jidong Liberated Area. Over the past four months, they have successively occupied more than 30 villages in the Liberated Area, including Yanggezhuang, Xiayuan, Gaogezhuang, Shichang, and Diaoyutai. They have captured and killed 41 district and village cadres of the democratic government and 42 family members of resistance fighters and civilians, looted countless materials, established strongholds in the occupied villages, forced the masses to buy guns, and formed so-called "Volunteer Corps."

    【新华社遵化二十日电】五月中旬以来，北宁路沿线美军，借口“保护交通”，即在唐山至开平间增兵五百余人。秦皇岛美军一部，亦开至昌黎西封台站增防，先后共达一千二百余人。唐山原驻美军四百人，北平至唐山间每一堡垒桥梁，均增驻美军二十三名。唐山市郊二十里内，更有美军卡车二三辆日夜巡逻。连日来平沈路军车频繁，国民党军在美军保护下，正继续运往东北扩大内战。
    【新华社张家口二十日电】冀东讯：（迟到）上月十九日拂晓四时，驻平古路密云、怀柔及高丽营等地之国民党九十二军侯镜如部二千余人，在一一六团副团长谭明率领下，携迫击炮八门，重机枪二十余挺，附汽车三辆，向解放区驻军防地桥梓村、逢山岭线进攻。八路军被迫自卫，激战一昼夜，至翌日上午十时，国民党军全部溃散，桥梓村失而复得，国民党军伤亡一六六团六连连长以下官兵四百余名，运回死尸七大车，一汽车，弃尸三十一具，我亦伤亡排长以下指战员七十余人。按平古路沿线侯镜如部，自一月十四日停战令生效后，迄今从未停止向冀东解放区蚕食进攻。四个月来，先后占领解放区之杨各庄、下园、高各庄、石厂、钓鱼台等村庄三十余处，捕杀民主政府区村干部四十一名，抗属及群众四十二名，抢掠物资无算，并在所侵占村庄建立据点，强迫群众买枪，成立所谓“义勇壮丁队”。
