　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th Dispatch】Rome News: On the 23rd, a massive demonstration of 130,000 people was held in Naples to respond to the蠢动 foolish acts of the Royalist Fascist bandits on the 19th. Participants in the demonstration included representatives of the army and navy, dock and ship sailors, and student groups. It is said that the demonstration was sponsored by the Italian Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Action Party, the Republican Party, and local trade unions. The Christian Democratic Party refused to join forces with the above-mentioned parties. Note: In order to sabotage the June 2nd election, Italian Royalist bandits held a demonstration on the 19th and scheduled a National Congress of the Royalist Party in Rome on the 24th, demanding a postponement of the election. Italian Interior Minister Romita stated that any attempt to postpone the election would be rejected, and the government is prepared to counter any conspiracy of terrorist tactics. According to a Reuters dispatch: The Allied Commission also rejected the Royalist Party and right-wing parties' demand for postponement of the general election, but on the day following this rejection (the 20th), according to a TASS dispatch: Britain and the United States immediately instructed the Italian government to reduce the daily bread ration from 200 grams to 150 grams (approximately 4.02 taels in China).
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th Dispatch】United Press, Washington News: Secret documents released by the U.S. State Department relating to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference reveal how former U.S. President Hoover and the Allies sought to use food as a political weapon to limit the rise of the communist movement. It is said that in 1919, U.S., British, French, and Italian politicians were deeply fearful of the rise of communism. Hoover then suggested that the people of Hungary, who had been under strict blockade, could receive food relief if they overthrew their Soviet government.

    英美训令意政府减少面包配给量
    【新华社延安二十五日电】罗马讯：二十三日那不勒斯举行十三万群众的巨大示威，以回答十九日保皇党法西斯匪徒的蠢动。参加示威者，包括陆军与海军的代表，码头轮船水手与学生团体的代表等，据称该项示威系在意大利共产党、社会党、行动党、共和党及地方工会之赞助下举行的。基督教民主党拒绝与上述政党联合行动。按：为破坏六月二日的大选，意大利保皇党匪徒曾于十九日举行示威，并定于二十四日在罗马召开保皇党全国大会，要求选举延期。意内长罗里特声明称：一切要求延期选举的企图都被拒绝，政府准备回击任何恐怖手段的阴谋活动。据路透社息：盟国委员会对保皇党及右翼党派普选延期之要求，亦予以拒绝，但随此拒绝之次日（二十日），据塔斯社讯：英美即训令意政府每日面包配给量额，由二百格兰姆，减至一百五十格兰姆（约合中国四·○二两）。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】合众社华盛顿讯：美国务院所发表与一九一九年巴黎和会有关的秘密文件中，透露美前总统胡佛与盟国如何设法利用粮食，作为限止共产主义运动兴起的政治武器。据称：一九一九年美、英、法、意、各国政治家，当时对于共产主义的兴起，深表恐惧，于是胡佛建议当时曾遭受严密封锁之匈牙利人民，如能推翻其苏维埃政府，可获得粮食之救济。
