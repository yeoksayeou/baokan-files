　　After the Red Army's Scheduled Withdrawal from the Northeast
    American Troops Remain in China, Aiding the Civil War
    Massino Discusses the China Question Again
    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] Moscow Radio commentator Massino, in another commentary on the China question, stated: Marshal Malinovsky's staff has officially announced that the withdrawal of the Red Army from Manchuria was completed on May 3rd. In the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers last December, Molotov and Byrnes reached an agreement that Soviet and American troops stationed in China should withdraw from China as soon as possible after fulfilling their duties and responsibilities. The Soviet Red Army's entry into Manchuria was intended to reduce Allied war casualties and liberate the Chinese people from Japanese enslavement. The Soviet Army had, and could have, no other purpose than this noble one. Therefore, after completing its mission of liberation, the Red Army withdrew from China. Moreover, the Red Army's withdrawal followed the statement made on February 16th this year by the representative of Marshal Malinovsky's staff, that the deadline for the Soviet Army's withdrawal from Manchuria would be before the deadline for the US military command to withdraw US troops from China. This plan has now been fully implemented. However, after the withdrawal of the Red Army troops from Manchuria, fierce fighting broke out between the Chinese Kuomintang army and the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. According to reliable sources, the Kuomintang army is using American weapons, and American aircraft are also helping the Kuomintang army bomb the Democratic Allied Army, causing extreme indignation among the Democratic Allied Army. At the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, Byrnes argued that the United States bears the primary responsibility for implementing the terms of Japan's surrender, namely, disarming the Japanese army and repatriating Japanese nationals. Byrnes stated that as soon as these responsibilities are fulfilled, or when the Chinese government no longer needs American help in fulfilling these responsibilities, the US military will immediately withdraw from China. However, according to Chinese and American newspaper reports, the assistance given by the US military in North China is of a different nature. The US military is not helping the Kuomintang to disarm the Japanese army and repatriate Japanese nationals, but is helping to transfer Kuomintang troops trained and equipped by the United States to fight the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. Martin, the New York Times correspondent in Tianjin, reported: In North China, in every city where American troops are stationed, hostility towards the American military is increasing. American soldiers do not feel like liberators, but feel like conquerors. Martin pointed out that American soldiers themselves see clearly that their presence in China is not for military needs, but for political reasons. American soldiers are often heard stating that they should help Chiang Kai-shek's army wage a civil war. But when American soldiers learned that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party had signed a ceasefire agreement on January 10th, they all stated: "Now we will finally be called home!" And the Chinese declared: "It would be good if the American troops withdrew!" But the American troops did not withdraw. The Washington Post also expressed anxiety about this, stating: "We cannot give any guarantee as to when our troops will withdraw from North China." As for the opinions of the people of the Northeast, they demanded that Truman order the US military command in China to stop transporting troops and ammunition to aid the Chinese civil war, and should fulfill the promise of the US military's withdrawal from China; but when the people of the Northeast made these demands, they did not yet know that the United States was directly interfering in the civil war on the side of the Kuomintang.

### 红军如期撤离东北后  美军仍留华助长内战  马西努再论中国问题

　　红军如期撤离东北后
    美军仍留华助长内战
    马西努再论中国问题
    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努，再论中国问题称：马林诺夫斯基元帅参谋部，已正式宣布红军从满洲撤退工作，已于五月三日完结。去年十二月三外长莫斯科会议中，莫洛托夫与贝纳斯商谈结果，曾达到一致协定，说驻在中国的苏军与美军，在完成自己的义务与责任后，尽可能在最短时期内从中国撤退。苏联红军之进入满洲，是欲减少盟国战争牺牲，及将中国人民从日寇奴役下解放出来，苏军除了这一高尚目的外，没有而且不能有其它目的，因此，红军在完成自己的解放使命后，便从中国撤退了。而且红军的撤退，是遵照今年二月十六日马林诺夫斯基元帅参谋部代表的声明，即苏军从满洲撤退的期限，要在美军指挥部从中国撤退美军的期限之前，这一计划，现在已完全实行了。但红军部队从满洲撤退之后，中国国民党军与东北民主联军之间，发生了激战，据可靠消息，国民党军使用美国武器，美国飞机亦帮助国民党军轰炸民主联军，引起民主联军的极端愤慨。在三国外长莫斯科会议上，贝纳斯借口说美国对于执行日本投降条件，即对解除日军武装与遣送日人回国，担任主要的责任。贝纳斯声明只要这些责任执行完毕，或中国政府在执行此项责任不需要美国帮助时，美军即马上从中国撤退。可是，据中国与美国报纸的消息，美军在华北所给予的帮助是带有另一种性质，美军不是帮助国民党解除日军武装与遣送日军回国，而是帮助转送美国所训练与装备的国民党军队去与东北民主联军作战。纽约时报驻天津记者马丁报导：在华北凡是驻有美军的城市，仇视美军的情绪日益加强，美军军人不感觉他们是解放者，而感觉自己是征服者。马丁指出，美国兵士自己亦看清楚他们驻在中国不是为了军事的需要，而是有其政治原因，常常听到美军士兵声明，他们应当帮助蒋介石军进行内战，但当美军兵士知道国共两党于一月十日签订停战协定时，都声明说：“现在终于会叫我们回家了吧！”而中国人则声明：“美军撤兵后那就好了！”可是美军没有撤退。华盛顿邮报对此亦表焦虑称：“我们的军队何时从华北撤退，我们不能给予任何担保。”至于说到东北人民的意见，他们要求杜鲁门命令驻华美军司令部停止运输军队弹药援助中国内战，而应当执行美军自中国撤退的约许；但东北人民提出这些要求时，他们还不知道美国站在国民党方面直接干涉内战。
