　　【This Newspaper, Xingtai News】Northern University recently held a grand evening party with over a thousand attendees to welcome Professors Chen, Wang, Yu, Guan, and Xie, who have come here to teach from places like Peiping-Tianjin, Kunming, Xi'an, and the Northeast, as well as the students who have come to study from the Great Rear Area. Secretary Luo of Peking University first extended respects to them on behalf of all teachers and students of the university. Then, President Fan explained the difference between Peking University and the schools in the Great Rear Area, stating that schools in the Liberated Areas have freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, and everyone is welcome to put forward their opinions for joint discussion and research. With our joint efforts, we have the confidence to make Peking University a democratic, free, and people-serving school. Finally, the professors elected Mr. Wang He to deliver a reply, he said: "I have two different feelings after arriving in the Liberated Area: (1) The Liberated Area is a new dictionary, containing words such as 'revolution,' 'democracy,' 'peace,' 'active production,' and 'labor,' which cannot be found in the corrupt and backward old dictionary of the Kuomintang-controlled area. (2) I hope that on the basis of joint research and mutual learning, we can create three types of soldiers: 'political soldiers,' 'economic soldiers,' and 'cultural soldiers,' in order to take on the task of peaceful construction of the new China." Afterwards, the Peking University and the former two theatrical troupes jointly performed entertainment programs, and the entire venue was filled with a happy atmosphere of democracy and unity, dispersing only at 11 o'clock at night.

　　北方大学举行盛大晚会
    欢迎新来教授同学
    王鹤教授说：解放区的和平民主，在国民党统治区是看不到的。
    【本报邢台讯】北方大学于日前举行千余人盛大晚会，欢迎新从平津、昆明、西安、东北等地来此执教的陈、王、余、关、谢诸教授和自大后方来学习的诸同学，首由北大罗秘书代表全校师生向他们致敬，继由范校长说明北大与大后方学校的不同，说明解放区的学校有言论、出版、集会的自由，大家有意见尽量提出，共同讨论研究。在我们共同努力下，有信心把北大办成一个民主、自由、为人民服务的学校。最后诸教授推选王鹤先生致答词，他说：“我到解放区有两种不同的感觉：（一）解放区是一部新字典，内有“革命”、“民主”、“和平”、“积极生产”、“劳动”等，这在国民党统治区腐败落后的老字典里是找不到的。（二）希望大家在共同研究互相学习的基础上能够造成三种兵“政治兵”、“经济兵”、“文化兵”，以便担任新中国的和平建设任务。后由北大和平原两剧团共同表演游艺节目，全场充满民主团结的愉快空气，夜十一点方散。
