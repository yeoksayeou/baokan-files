　　【Dispatch from Changzhi by this newspaper】After the victory of the anti-traitor and rent reduction movement, the masses in Bo'ai, Wuzhi, Xiuwu, and other counties in northern Henan are organizing to build water conservancy projects and fight against natural disasters. The Grain Transport River in the Fourth District of Bo'ai had not been dredged for fifty years. When the Kuomintang's 40th and 27th Armies were entrenched in Bo'ai, they were unable to stop the enemy's tank attacks and decided to breach the Grain Transport River dyke, flooding Jianggou. Since then, the Grain Transport River water could not be used for irrigation in normal times, and during the rainy season, due to the narrowness of the ditch and the high riverbed, over 50,000 mu of fertile land along the riverbank was flooded, and all the crops were destroyed, resulting in a loss of over 15,000 dan of grain for the masses each year. If we also consider the 3,000 mu of farmland occupied by Jianggou, the annual loss to the masses would be over 20,000 dan. Last month, under the leadership of the democratic government, the masses of 38 villages in the district established a water conservancy committee. After eight days of hard work and the expenditure of over 30,000 labor days, they finally transformed the Grain Transport River, which had caused so much harm, into a river that benefits the people. Tens of thousands of mu of fertile land along the river will now be able to achieve a good harvest without worry. Although the people of Wuzhi and Xiuwu counties in the bordering areas are subject to all kinds of sabotage and harassment by the Kuomintang army and puppet troops, the county's democratic government has resolutely implemented the "Qin River Dyke Repair" resolution passed by the county council last month. The Qin River has a high riverbed and low ground. In the Shijing and Zhaoyang areas, the dykes are only two or three chi thick. During the summer floods, tens of thousands of people in the two counties will inevitably suffer from floods. Therefore, the councils of the two counties have passed a huge budget to build the river dyke. Now the county democratic government has concentrated experienced people from along the river to form a river affairs committee to carry out planning, and it is expected that it can be completed before the wheat harvest.

　　翻身群众修浚运粮河
    博爱五万亩地成良田
    【本报长治讯】豫北博爱、武陟、修武等县群众，于反奸减租胜利后，正组织起来，兴修水利，和天灾自然作斗争。博爱四区的运粮河，五十年来，未曾修浚。国民党四十军、廿七军盘踞博爱时，无法阻止敌人坦克进攻，曾决运粮河堤，灌入蒋沟，从此运粮河水，平时便无法浇地，一到雨季，因沟内窄狭，河床又高，河堤沿岸五万余亩良田，尽被水淹，田禾全被冲毁，每年群众少打粮食一万五千余石。若再将蒋沟，所占民田三千余亩计算在内，则每年群众所受损失当在两万石以上。上月该区卅八村群众在民主政府领导下，成立了水利委员会，共经八天的努力，费三万余工，终将百害之运粮河，修成造福人民的河流，沿河数万亩良田从此当可丰收无虑。边沿县区武陟、修武人民虽在国民党军队和伪军百般破坏袭扰下，该县民主政府亦坚决执行，上月县参议会通过的“沁河修堤”的决议，沁河河高地低，石敬兆阳一带，堤厚仅二、三尺，夏季河涨两县数万群众，即难免水灾。因之两县参议会通过巨大预算，兴修该河河堤，现该县民主政府，已集中全县沿河有经验人士组织河务委员会，进行策划，预计在麦收前，即可全部完成。
