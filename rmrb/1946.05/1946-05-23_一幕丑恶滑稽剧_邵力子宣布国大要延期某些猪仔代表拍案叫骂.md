　　A Hideous Farce
　　Shao Lizi Announces National Assembly Postponement; Certain "Piglet Representatives" Slam the Table and Shout Abuse
　　[New China News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] According to the Tianjin Dagongbao: At a tea party held in Nanjing on the 6th of this month, Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the National Assembly, announced to the "representatives" who were present that they should return to their respective places in a few days. Some of the "representatives" questioned him and even slammed the table and scolded him, almost to the point of violence. Among those present that day were Zhu Jingnong, Chen Qicai, and over two hundred others. Chen Lifu, Zhang LiSheng, and Zhang Daofan were also in attendance. After Shao finished his speech, Wang Lifu, He Ranru, Chang Zonghui, Liu Guoping, Chen Zifeng, Li Zhenya, Ge Kunshan, Dai Ziqiu, Chen Guojun, Liu Zhidang, He Yangling, Wang Shuhui, and Chen Shichang all spoke passionately, shouting loudly. When the attendees heard the excitement, some pounded the table, kicked their feet, or made strange noises by banging on chairs, hitting teacups and plates, and cheering. Some of the speakers were pounding the table and stamping their feet. They mostly criticized the repeated postponements.
　　Chen Zifeng said: If the National Assembly does not meet, the representatives will never leave Beijing. If you want to drive the representatives away, please bring out the guns; and he resolutely opposed the Political Consultative Conference, believing it to be unfounded in law and unacceptable. Dai Ziqiu said: "If the national problems cannot be resolved, we can launch a punitive expedition." Liu Zhidang referred to the CCP as "bandits," and the Political Consultative Conference as negotiation with bandits. He also said that Shao was shirking responsibility onto the leader, expressing dissatisfaction, saying that Shao's participation in the Political Consultative Conference had achieved nothing, his thinking was fundamentally wrong, and should be corrected. Xiang Yujie believed that the government did not respect the "representatives," and declared on the spot that he was resigning, taking off his badge and handing it to Shao, and said that the proof documents would also be returned. He then left in anger. Hong Lanyou hurriedly rushed out to dissuade him. In the end, Shao still answered tactfully, saying that if the Political Consultative Conference was considered a failure, he would never evade responsibility, and put forward his own views on the postponement of the National Assembly, that the government intended to be cautious about this grand plan for peaceful national construction, and there was no question of breach of faith or not. As soon as Shao sat down, someone shouted and screamed, saying that his thinking was fundamentally wrong, and the crowd shouted and called for a beating. Shao still said "It doesn't matter," and left the scene under the escort of several staff members. At this point, someone shouted for adjournment, and that they would talk to Chairman Chiang tomorrow. The meeting ended unhappily.

　　一幕丑恶滑稽剧
    邵力子宣布国大要延期某些猪仔代表拍案叫骂
    【新华社延安十九日电】据天津大公报载：国大筹委会主委邵力子氏，于本月六日在南京招待到京国大代表茶会上，宣布这些“代表”应于数日内各返原地时，曾被某些“代表”纷纷质询，甚至拍桌责骂，几至动武，该日到会者计有朱经农、陈其采等二百余人，陈立夫、张厉生、张道藩亦到会，当邵氏致词毕，王立夫、何冉如、常宗会、柳国平、陈紫枫、李振亚、葛崐山、戴子球、陈国钧、刘芷党、贺扬灵、王叔惠、陈时昌，均慨慷陈词，大嚷大叫，与会人员听到激昂处，有捶桌打椅敲打茶杯磁盘怪声叫好者，发言中有捶桌跳脚者，他们多指摘不应一再延期。
    陈紫枫说：国大不开会，代表决不离京。要赶代表走，请拿枪杆出来；并对政协会一致反对，认为于法无据，不能承认。戴子球说：“全国问题不能解决，可以讨伐”，刘芷党指中共为“匪”，政协是与匪协商。并说邵氏诿卸责任于领袖，表示不满，说邵参加政协一无成就，思想根本错误，应该纠正等语。向郁阶认为政府不尊重“代表”，当场声明辞掉不干，并将证章摘下交与邵氏，且说证明文件亦即退还，言罢愤愤而去，洪兰友还急忙赶出婉劝，最后邵氏仍然委婉致答，说政协如果算是失败，绝不逃避责任，对国大延期事提出他自己的看法，政府意在慎重此和平建国大计，并无失信与不失信的问题。邵氏始落座，即有人大嚣大叫，说思想根本错误，群起高呼喊打，邵氏仍表“没有关系”，即在数职员护卫中离场，至此有人大呼散会，明天当面和蒋主席谈，会议不欢而散。
