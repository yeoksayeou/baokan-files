　　Working Women

　　War is not just a disaster; it is also a test, a great school for inspecting the people's strength.
                                                  ——Stalin

　　My work in Zuoquan had come to an end. The day before I was to leave Liangyu for Wuxiang, groups of women came to see me off. Each one said as soon as they entered:
　　“Why are you leaving so soon? Stay a few more days! Help us to better develop the textile work.”
　　Looking at their faces, reddened by the mountain wind, their sturdy figures, and listening to their enthusiastic words, I was indeed reluctant to leave them immediately. I repeatedly asked them to sit down on the kang so that we could talk for a few more minutes before parting. But they were always eager to brush off the manure clinging to their old clothes, some even wiping the sweat from their foreheads with their sleeves, as if they couldn't sit still. They said to me:
　　“We are busy delivering manure to the fields! We heard you were leaving, and everyone wanted to come and see you. Our mutual aid team discussed it, and we are taking turns coming, but we can't sit for too long, or we'll be criticized for missing work.”
　　So, I didn't try to keep them any longer, but according to each of their requests, I wrote my name in their study notebooks, along with simple words of encouragement and hope.

　　All day long, my room was never empty. They came and went, and went and came again, with deep affection.

　　For the sake of the next day's journey, I went to bed early that night. Just as I was about to blow out the lamp and prepare to sleep, suddenly, my door, which was latched from the outside, was pushed open by someone who had rushed over.

　　“Gaimei, why have you come running over at this hour?” I asked in surprise as I recognized the familiar face of the person who had entered in the lamplight.

　　She didn't bother to speak, but ran to my kang, pressed her hands on my upper body to stop me from sitting up, and, leaning over my pillow, said breathlessly:
　　“I'll see you off tomorrow morning! The village chief just told me at my house, and I was so happy, I couldn't help but come and tell you, or I wouldn't be able to sleep all night.”
　　Her dark eyes looked straight at me, and she said as innocently as a child:
　　“I'm telling you, my donkey is the most hardworking in the whole village. Tonight, I'll take special care to feed it. You should rest well!”

　　After speaking, she stood up to leave. I grabbed her arm, and said uneasily:
　　“Isn't there anyone else at home who can go? Asking you to run back and forth seventy or eighty li in a day, I'm afraid you'll be exhausted!”
　　“What are you saying? Even if there was someone at home, I would still have to see you off tomorrow. This is a rare opportunity, and the other women are envious! Who wouldn't want to see you off? You've lived in our village for a month, and you know that everything in Liangyu depends on us women. Carrying stretchers, walking dozens of li, what's it to help you drive the animals? I'll take care of Little Slowpoke (note) along the way. I can be back before dark.” She said with her dark eyes wide open and full of reason.

　　I was moved by her kind and resolute words. I stroked her head wrapped in a white towel and said sincerely:
　　“I would love for you to see me off! It would be best if you could stay with me in Hongshui for one night and then return the next day. We can talk and have fun, and you can look around. Talk it over with your family and see what they say.”

　　She agreed with my suggestion. She was so happy that she could hardly speak. After a moment, she squeezed my hand hard and turned to run. Her short stature was as nimble as when she led the young women in running every morning, and she quickly darted out of the room. After carefully latching the door for me, she said softly from the crack in the door:
　　“I'll be ready early tomorrow.”

　　Like having drunk a few cups of strong, hot wine, the women's squad leader's late-night visit stimulated me so much that I couldn't sleep at all. I was excitedly thinking about Gaimei, and all the women in Liangyu village who were like her. Their diligent, hardworking, and simple figures, a series of vivid memories, were all active before my eyes.

　　I remember that the day I first arrived in the village, it was just after the Lantern Festival. According to the customs of the rural people, it was still a good time for rest and recreation, but I saw many women carrying baskets and picking up manure everywhere, many of them white-haired old women. The people who saw them all encouraged them in the same respectful voice:
　　“Keep it up, labor heroes!”
　　The women picking up manure would raise their heads and smile, shake their heads with an embarrassed expression, and then bend down and work hard again.

　　Walking into the village, a miraculous scene entered my eyes. There was not a single young man to be seen on the streets. All who were active everywhere were long-bearded old men, middle-aged men and women, and children. Many women, striding with big feet and chests held high, walked quickly back and forth carrying large buckets of water. As soon as they came to me, they put down the water buckets and, as if they had seen their most familiar relatives and friends, vied with each other to invite me to their homes.
　　I patted their hard shoulders and praised them:
　　“What a skill! Carrying such big buckets of water.”
　　“Good comrade, this is the ordinary work of the women in our place. Anyone can do it. The men have all gone to fight the Japanese, and the women have to eat, and they can bear it.” They replied in unison.

　　When I lived among them and gradually became familiar with them, they unreservedly poured out their heartfelt words to me: their pain, joy, and hope. In this way, I also gained a more specific and comprehensive understanding of the disasters they had endured, the heroic struggles, their liberation, progress, and the democratic and free life they now enjoyed. These stories, full of blood and tears, magnificent, vivid, and rich, left me with a deep and indelible memory. Tonight, this memory robbed me of my sleep for the first time.

　　The few profound words that the Women's Federation Secretary Yi Shengyu often told me clearly lingered in my ears:
　　“Almost all of our women are involved in the anti-Japanese movement, and there are also many glorious widows and mothers of martyrs. All the production and anti-Japanese work in the village depends on us. We are also the center of the labor mutual aid teams. Just think, of the eighty-six women in the village who are able to work, all but five or six who are old or disabled have joined the mutual aid teams.”

　　These words, like what they did, are glorious and worthy of pride! In the eight years of cruel struggle against the enemy, their small village of eighty-odd households sent more than fifty young men to the anti-Japanese Eighth Route Army, and many militiamen made heroic and tragic sacrifices in the battles to defend the village. In the middle of this, the wives and mothers mobilized and encouraged their husbands and sons. They sent them to join the army, and fought alongside them. When they left the village, they straightened their chests, took on all the work they had left behind, and resolutely refused to maintain the enemy. I will never forget how each of them once told me how they shattered the enemy's intimidation and threats with their iron will. They said:
　　“When the enemy came, all of us in the village ran to the mountains all around. I don't know how many times the devils set fire to the houses in the village, and the puppet soldiers shouted for us to go back and maintain them. We had long ago made up our minds that even if everything was burned to the ground, we would move to the gullies and wilderness to live, and we would not go back. The fire burned red in the sky, but no one's heart was moved... When the devils went back, we crawled into the fire, raked around, and lived there again, worked the land, spun cotton, wove cloth, and did what we were supposed to do. In the end, the devils couldn't do anything to us Liangyu people!”

　　They recounted the hardships they had endured, remembered their dead or long-separated relatives, but their mood was open and cheerful.

　　Yang Laijie, this young and enthusiastic widow who had lived independently with three children for five years, since she personally washed and dressed her militia husband, who had died in the enemy's bullets in a rainstorm in May 1941, and then buried and commemorated him with the villagers, she wiped away her tears, ate less and wore less in the war-torn life, used her own labor to raise her orphans, and never cried again. In the labor mutual aid team, she earned a full ten points every day for a full laborer, and received the glorious commendation of model every year. A few days earlier, at the March 8th Women's Day celebration, she learned from the newly learned commemorative song and the chairman's speech that women in the period of peace and construction should participate in production even better. So, at the meeting, in addition to enthusiastically proposing labor competitions to many women, she also guaranteed herself with an oath-like words:
　　“The mutual aid team is like a family, and the team leader is our head of the family. I will accept his leadership and obey his distribution in everything. In the future, no matter if it's picking manure, harrowing the fields, sowing seeds, transplanting seedlings, harvesting grain, threshing, digging yams, I will work harder than any year, and I also plan to learn to weave cloth, to supply clothes for myself and my children.”

　　Martyr's mother Fan Sannv, her four children with strong physiques and tenacious personalities, two of whom had sacrificed, one of whom had been lost, and the other of whom was working day and night as the village political director, was sick every other day. This old lady, although she was over sixty years old and her heart was full of scars, had a high degree of love for life and enough confidence and hope for the future. She worked vigorously like a young person in non-stop labor. Often late at night, one could still hear the buzzing of her spinning wheel turning in the dark. She carefully managed a group of grandchildren without fathers, so that her daughters-in-law could study culture in the people's school with peace of mind. During the most intense season of farming, in addition to cooking for her daughters-in-law working in the fields and carrying water with her eldest grandson, she also took on the responsibility of caring for the animals and all the work at home. The people of the whole village respected this working mother. After she was rewarded again at this memorial meeting, she said as she did when I first saw her:
　　“The sons were all very resolute, and they died gloriously. Thinking of them, even if I am old, I will work as long as I can move!”

　　Only the women who have truly been liberated under this democratic regime can use practical labor to commemorate their meaningful festivals. The memorial meeting was held concisely and substantively. Everyone, whether criticizing others, reviewing themselves, making plans, or making challenges, was sincere, serious, and without a single empty word or unrealistic fantasy. They issued strict and sharp warnings to a woman who was idle and wanted to divorce a man who could endure hardship:
　　“In the people's school, we collectively educated her. The Women's Federation Secretary, the village chief, everyone talked to her. People are not stones, they should always change!”
　　“She can't get a divorce, a man who can endure hardship is the best condition!”
　　“It's no use hiding back at her mother's house. There are the same people's schools and mutual aid teams in her mother's village. Write her a transfer certificate, and she has to move there the same way. People live in their mother's house, but work cannot live in their mother's house!”

　　In this heated and tense atmosphere, I found that Li Fengying, a member of the Women's Federation Standing Committee, who was sitting next to the stove in front, had been silent all the time. Her thin face was drooping on her chest, as if she had some deep thoughts. From time to time, she turned her eyes, somewhat ashamed, and secretly looked at me. This expression made a deep impression on me. Several times, she specially ran to see me, sat on the edge of my kang, and just looked at me with such eyes, moving her mouth to say something to me, but never said it.

　　After the meeting, I followed behind the crowded people and automatically walked to her side, gently saying to her:
　　“Fengying, let's go, I'll go to your house and play!”
　　She grabbed my hand hard, expressing a warm welcome. We went to the back village.

　　In the middle of a ruined wall destroyed by the enemy, there were two dilapidated houses. She pushed open the door and walked in with me, and let me sit on her kang, which only had a thin quilt on it.
　　“Fengying, what's on your mind? Why are you always unhappy?” I opened my mouth first.
　　She moved closer to me and said embarrassedly:
　　“It's not unhappiness, I just feel too sorry for the work.”
　　“If there's anything, let's talk about it.”
　　“I wanted to talk to you a long time ago...” She sighed a long breath. “I couldn't stand the test myself...”
　　I stroked her trembling shoulders and asked:
　　“Fengying, what exactly is going on?”

　　She forced a smile and said:
　　“I have already recognized my mistakes, and I have been persuaded by other sisters, and I am not afraid of you laughing at me now.”
　　She paused, and her expression became more natural as she continued:
　　“After my man joined the army, I didn't even receive a letter. I was all alone, pulling a child, and I spent seven years in this empty house. Life was relatively difficult. When I went out to work and do production, it was booming, but when I came home, I felt helpless and lonely.” Her eyes were red, and she tried hard to suppress the crystal tears in her eyes. “Last year, the Independent Battalion lived here. The battalion commander was a good person, and often came to my house to check on me. Seeing my difficulties, he sometimes helped me carry water. As the days went by, we developed feelings for each other, and later he proposed to get engaged to me. At that time, I didn't tell the village or the Women's Federation Secretary about these things. But later, when I thought about it carefully, I felt that it shouldn't be done this way. When the man left, our feelings were good, and he let me wait for him at home, and joined the army early. People are fighting the war outside for the country and the people, and I should wait for him. I heard that many veteran cadres have been out for more than ten years and can't send letters home. In this way, I turned down the battalion commander.”
　　I comforted her and said:
　　“It's very right to deal with things this way! What else are you uneasy about?”
　　She lowered her head, and after a long time, she said:
　　“I am a person who is naturally good-natured. Whenever I think of this, I feel like there is a knot in my heart, and I feel like I have smeared ash on my face. In addition, I have been working since the establishment of the Women's Federation. My affair has a very bad influence on the dependents of the martyrs! So, I am always uncomfortable in my mind.”
　　“I hope you will be happy. You have passed the test! You have new understanding, and in the future, you will work more actively, and in work and labor, you will be able to exercise our women's courage and ability to live independently even more!”

　　She smiled easily, and her heart seemed to be relieved of a heavy burden. This smiling image is also floating before my eyes tonight. Among the women in Liangyu, there are many such lovable people who are responsible for their work, know how to cherish real feelings, seriously consider life issues, and think about the future, just like Fengying!

　　Thinking of these new types of working women who have been tempered in battle and production, I haven't slept for a long time.

　　When it was about to dawn, someone shouted in the yard:
　　“The guesthouse is preparing to take over!”
　　Someone grabbed and promised:
　　“If there are any lottery numbers or errands to be assigned today, give priority to those of us who don't have children!”
　　“It's all the same, there is no shortage of people in the fields!”
　　Before long, a song, like every day, rang out in the village:
　　……
　　This year's March 8th is very different.
　　Peace, construction, sisters! Increase production!
　　New women can work, and they can do everything,
　　Eating, dressing, sisters, don't rely on men.
　　……
　　Then the sound of the donkey's bells, the rough breathing of the old cow, mixed with the laughter and commotion of the women, flowed past my window facing the street and into the fields....

　　(Note): In the second district of Zuoquan, small children are called Little Slowpoke.

### 劳动的妇女们

　　劳动的妇女们
    战争不只是灾害，它还是一种考验，一种检阅人民力量的伟大学校。
                                                  ——斯大林
    左权的工作告了一个段落。当我要离开梁峪到武乡去的先一天，一起一起的妇女们，都跑来给我送行了。她们每个人都是一进门就说：
    “你怎呢就要走？在俺们这多定上几天吧！帮助俺们把纺织好好开展开展。”
    我看着她们一张张被山风吹得发红的脸，一个个健壮结实的体格，和听着她这样充满着热情的话，确实有些不愿马上离开她们了。我再三要她们到炕上坐下来，大家好在临别前多谈十几句话。可是，她们总急于拍打破旧的衣服上满沾的粪土，有的还用袖子抹着额头上的汗粒，像是安静不住的样子，对我说：
    “俺们都是正忙着朝地里送粪呢！是听说你要走了，谁都想过来照照你。俺们互助组商量了一下，大家才轮流着来，可不敢多坐，误了班，还得挨批评哩。”
    这样，我就没有再多留她们，只按照她们每个人的要求，一个个的在她们的学习本子上，写下了我的名字，和我对她们鼓励，希望的简单的话句。
    一整天，我的屋子里没有断人。她们带着深深的依恋，来了去，去了又来。
    为着第二天的行程，夜晚，我早点躺下了。当我正要吹熄了灯准备睡的时候，突然，我的从外面反扣着的房门，被一个匆匆跑来的人推开了。
    “改梅，你怎么这个时候跑来了？”我从灯光中一发现进来的人的熟悉的面孔，就惊喜的问了一声。
    她顾不得讲话，跑到我的炕前，两只手按着我要坐起的上身，伏在我的枕头边，喘吁吁的说：
    “明儿早上，我去送你呵！村长刚刚一来俺家告诉，我就喜的了不得，我鳖不住要来对你说，要不，我一晚上也睡不着。”
    她的一封黑眼睛直直的对我看着，小孩子一般天真的又说：
    “我对你说，俺家那头毛驴子，是全村顶吃劲的一个，今黑夜，我操心喂上。你可好好歇息歇息吧！”
    说完了话，她站起来就要走。我一把扯住了她的胳脯，不安的说：
    “家里没有别的人能去了吗？一天叫你往返跑七八十里，怕累着你了呵！”
    “看你说的那里话？别说家里根本没有人，就是有人，我明天也非去送你不行。这是个难得的机会，别的妇女听说都还眼红呢！谁不想去送送你？你在俺村住了月把，也知道，梁峪什么事也全凭俺们老婆们办。抬上担架，一走就是几十里，帮你赶赶牲口算个什？路上替你照照小慢慢（注）。赶黑就能返回来。”她瞪大了黑眼睛十分有理由的说。
    我被她的亲切而刚毅的话感动了。我用手拨了拨她的包着白毛巾的头，诚恳的说：
    “我是巴不得你们来送我呵！你最好能跟我在洪水住一晚上，第二天就返回来。我们多谈谈玩玩，你也可以游窜游窜。你回去跟家里商量商量，看怎么样？”
    她十分同意我的这个提议。高兴得几乎连话都说不上来。停了一下，她用力握了握我的手，转身就跑了。她的短小的身材，如同每天清晨带领着青年妇女们跑步一样的轻捷，很快就闪出屋门去。她替我好好将门挂起后，又从门缝里轻声的说：
    “明儿，我早早就准备停当了。”
    如同喝了几杯浓热的酒，这妇女分队长的黑夜赶来，刺激得我无论如何也睡不着了。心中兴奋的在想着改梅，以及和改梅一样的梁峪村所有的妇女们。她们勤劳、刻苦、朴素的姿影，一连串的鲜明的记忆，都活动在我的眼前了。
    记得，我初到村子的那一天，是刚刚过了元宵节，按乡村老百姓的习惯，还正是休息玩乐的好时候，我却看见不少的妇女们，提着筐子在到处拾粪，其中很多是白发苍苍的老太婆。看见她们的人，都用着同样尊重的声音鼓励着说：
    “加油呵！劳动英雄！”
    拾粪的妇女们，抬起头来笑笑，用着不好意思的神情摇摇手，又弯下腰紧张的工作起来。
    走进村子里，一桩奇迹似的景象，映进了我的眼睛里。街道上看不见一个青年男人。活动在各处的，尽都是长胡须的老汉。上年纪的中年男人、妇女和小孩子们。很多妇女们，迈动着大脚板，挺着胸，快步的挑着大水桶来回走着。她们一走到我跟前，就放下水桶，像见了她们最熟悉的亲戚朋友一样，争抢着要我到她们家里去。
    我拍着她们的硬棒棒的肩膀头赞扬的说：
    “好本事呵！挑上这么大两桶水。”
    “好同志，这是俺们地方老婆们普通的营生。谁也干得了。男人们都抗日走了，妇人们要吃饭，一样能受。”她们异口同声的回答。
    当我生活在她们中间，渐渐和她们熟悉起来的时候，她们毫无顾忌的向我倾吐自己心底的话：她们的痛苦、快乐、和希望。这样，我也更具体更全面的了解了她们所经受的灾难，英勇的挣扎、翻身、进步，以及现在的民主自由的生活。这些充满着血泪，壮烈的、生动的、丰富的，故事一般的生活，留给我深厚的，难以泯灭的记忆。今夜，这记忆第一次夺去了我的睡眠。
    我的耳朵边，清晰的萦绕着妇救秘书易生鱼时常对我讲的几句深刻的话：
    “俺们妇女们，差不多个个都是抗动，还有不少光荣的寡妇和烈士的母亲。全村的生产和抗动工作，都全凭俺们担任，劳动互助组里，也是俺们成了中心。你想，全村八十六个能劳动的妇女，除了五六个年纪老和有残疾的外，全都参加了互助组。”
    这些话和她们所做的一样，是光荣而值得骄傲的呵！在八年来残酷的对敌斗争里，她们这小小的八十几户人家的村庄里，竟送出了五十多个青年男人到了抗日的八路军，还有不少民兵，在保卫村庄的战斗里做了英勇壮烈的牺牲。这中间，妻子和母亲，动员和鼓励了她们的丈夫、儿子。送他们参了军，和她们并肩参战。当他们离开了村子以后，她们就挺起胸膛，担当起他们遗留下的一切工作，并且坚决的拒绝了维持敌人。我永远也不会忘记，她们每一个人曾经对我讲述过的，她们如何用钢铁的意志，粉碎了敌人对她们的恐吓和威胁。她们说：
    “敌人一上来，俺们全村都跑到四下山里去了。不知道有多少回，狗日的在村子里，点着房子，伪军们吼叫着要俺们回去维持，俺们是早就下定了决心，全付烧光，俺们搬到山沟野地里住，也不回去。火烧得满天红，谁的心也没动过……等狗们回去了，我们钻进火堆里，扒扒扫扫又住下来，闹养种，纺花织布，该干什干什，到底狗日的也没奈何了俺梁峪老百姓！”
    她们讲述着挨受的艰难困苦，忆念着自己死去或久别的亲人，心情却是开朗和愉快的。
    杨来杰，这带着三个孩子，独立生活了五年的年轻而热情的寡妇，她自从在四一年五月的黑夜，亲手洗净和装殓了她那在暴风雨中，死在敌人枪弹中的民兵丈夫，又同着村人们一齐殡葬公祭以后，她揩干了眼泪，少吃没穿的在战争生活中，用自己的劳力，抚育着孤儿，再也没有哭泣过。在劳动互助组里面她顶上一个每天得十分的全劳动力，每年获得模范的光荣表扬。早几天在三八妇女节纪念会上，她从新学会的纪念歌上和主席的讲话里，了解了和平建设时期的妇女，是要更好的参加生产。于是，她在会上，除了热烈的向很多妇女提出劳动竞赛，还用发誓样的话来保证自己说：
    “互助组在一搭，像一家人，组长就是咱们个当家的，我一切都受他的领导，服从他的分配，往后去，不管挑粪、耢地、溜籽垧、拔苗、割谷、打场、刨山药、我要比那一年都卖力气干，还打算学会织布，供上自己和孩子们穿衣服。”
    烈士的母亲范三女，她的四个生着健壮体格，具有坚韧性格的孩子，两个牺牲了，一个失去了音信，另一个由于担任村政治主任的工作，在日夜忙碌中，三天两头有病。这位老太太，虽然是六十多岁的人，心中又负满伤痕，却对生活带着高度的热爱，对未来有着足够的信心和希望。在不休停的劳动中起劲得像年轻人一样。常常在深夜里，还听见她在黑暗中嗡嗡转动的纺车声，她细心的经管一群没有爸爸的孙儿，使媳妇们能够安心的在民学里学习文化。当养种最紧张的季节，她除了替在地里劳作的媳妇们做饭，和大的孙儿抬水外，还担当起照料牲口及家中一切工作。全村的人们都崇敬这位劳动的母亲。在这次纪念会上她又一次受到奖励以后，她像刚见我的时候一样说：
    “儿子们个个都是很坚决，他们死得光荣。想起他们，我就是老了，能动弹一天就要动弹一天！”
    只有这民主政权下真正得到解放的妇女们，才能用劳动的实际来纪念自己的有意义的节日。纪念会是开得又精悍又充实。大家不论是批评别人，检讨自己，订计划，提挑战，都是诚恳，认真，没有一句空话或一些脱离实际的幻想。她们对一个游手好闲而要提出和能受苦的男人离婚的女人，发出严格的尖锐的警告：
    “在民学里，我们集体教育过她，妇救秘书，村长，谁都给她谈过，人不是块石头，总应该转变转变了！”
    “她不能离婚，男人能受苦，就是个最好的条件！”
    “回娘家躲也不行，娘家村里一样有民学，有互助组，给她写个转学证，到那一样得动弹，人住娘家，工作不能住娘家！”
    在这样热烈而紧张的空气里，我却发现坐在前面炉火旁边的妇救常委李凤英，她一直沉默着，瘦瘦的脸孔低垂在胸前，如同有什么深的思虑，时而，她翻动着有些带着愧羞的眼睛，偷偷的看着我。这个表情给我的印象很深，好几次，她特意跑来看我，坐在我的炕边，就是用这样的目光看着我，张动着嘴巴想对我讲什么，却始终没有讲出来。
    散会以后，我跟在拥挤的人们的后头，自动走到她的身边，轻轻的对她说：
    “凤英，走，我上你家去玩玩！”
    她使劲抓住我的手，表示着热挚的欢迎。我们就往后庄走去。
    一片被敌人烧毁的残垣中间，有两间破旧的房子，她推开门和我走进去，让我坐在她那只放着一个薄薄的小被子的炕上。
    “凤英，你有什么心思呢？怎呢老是不高兴？”我先开了口。
    她凑近了我一些，不好意思的说：
    “不是不高兴，我觉得太对不住工作呵。”
    “有什么事，大家谈谈就完啦。”
    “我早就想跟你话拢话拢……”她长长的叹了一口气。“是我自己经不住考验呵……”
    我抚住她的有些抖颤的肩膀问：
    “凤英，究竟是怎么一回事？”
    她勉强的笑了笑说：
    “我已经认识了自己的错误，也得到过别的姐妹们的劝说，现在也不怕你笑话了。”
    她停了停，神态变得比较自然的接着说：
    “男人参军以后，连一封信也没有，我孤伶伶的，拉把一个孩子，就在这个空房子里过了七年。生活比较困难，出去干工作闹生产时红红火火的，一回到家就觉得没办法，冷寂寂的。”她的眼圈儿发红了，她强抑着眼中晶莹泪珠。“去年，独立营在俺们这住，营长是个好人，常到俺们家照照，看见我困难，有时帮助俺挑些水，日子长了，俺两人就发生了感情，后来他提出要和我订婚。当时，我没有把这些事情对村上和妇救会秘书说。可是，后来自己仔细一想，觉得不应当这样办。伢走的时候，俺二人感情可好哩，他放心我在家里等他，才早早的就参军走啦。人家为国家为百姓在外面抗战，应该等着伢，听说，很多老干部，出来十几年也不能往家捎信。这样，我就把营长那方面回绝了。”
    我安慰她说：
    “事情这样处理很对吆！你心里还有什么不安呢？”
    她低下了头，好半天才说：
    “我是个生性要好的人，什么时候一想起这件事，心里就像结个疙疸，觉得自己给自己脸上抹了灰。再加上，我从妇救会成立，就担任着工作，我这回事，对抗属影响多不好呵！所以，精神上总不舒展。”
    “我希望你愉快起来，你这就是经过了考验啦！又有了新的认识，往后去，更积极的去工作，在工作和劳动里，越发能锻炼我们妇女独立生活的勇气和能力！”
    她轻松的笑了，心中如同卸去一个重负。这笑影今夜也浮在我的眼前了。在梁峪妇女里面，有不少这样具有对工作负责，知道珍惜真的感情，严肃的考虑生活问题，着想前途，和凤英一样令人敬爱的人呵！
    想着这些从战斗和生产中锻炼出来的新型的劳动的妇女们，我很久没有睡。”
     天快亮的时候，有人在院子里喊：
     “招待所里准备接班呵！”
    有人抢着答应了：
    “今天如果有什么送彩号，支差，先尽俺们这没娃娃的去吧！”
    “一样，地里也少不了人！”
    不一会，一片歌声如同每天一样在村子里响起了：
    ……
    今年的三八节，大大不一般。
     和平，建设，姐妹呀！增加生产！
     新妇女能劳动，样样都要干，
