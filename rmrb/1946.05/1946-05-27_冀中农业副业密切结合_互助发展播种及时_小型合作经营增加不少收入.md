　　Central Hebei Integrates Agriculture and Sideline Occupations Closely
    Mutual Aid Promotes Timely Planting
    Small-Scale Cooperative Management Increases Income Significantly
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 22nd] After rent reduction, rent investigation, and solving the difficulties of the masses in various counties of central Hebei, the masses' enthusiasm for production has been greatly increased. In the Third District of Anguo, 41 out of 45 villages have established mutual aid groups. In the First District of Anping, 25 villages have organized 363 groups. These organizations are formed voluntarily by the masses and are not bound by fixed forms. This type of organization is even more widespread in Gaoyang. According to statistics from mid-April, about 30% or more of the villages in the county have organized mutual aid groups for both men and women. The production difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, the poor, and the widowed are also resolved through mutual aid. Anguo labor hero Yu Zhixiang united 119 households (out of a total of 281 households) in Liujiazuo Village to establish 10 mutual aid groups and 4 women's textile groups. Based on agricultural mutual aid, he further organized 11 production groups for cotton ginning, weaving, cigarette rolling, and transportation and sales. In these mutual aid activities, the integration of agriculture with various small businesses and handicrafts is even closer. For example, among the mutual aid groups in the 25 villages of the First District of Anping, there are as many as 25 types of activities combined with agriculture, including weaving basket bottoms, weaving towels, weaving cloth, cotton ginning, making toothbrushes, rolling cigarettes, oil pressing, adobe making, brick firing, and transportation and sales. Many villages have adopted small-scale cooperative forms of mutual aid management for handicrafts and household sideline occupations. Since the start of spring plowing this year, not only has sowing been timely in various places, but also sideline occupations have generated significant increases in income.

　　冀中农业副业密切结合
    互助发展播种及时         
    小型合作经营增加不少收入
    【新华社河间二十二日电】冀中各县在减租、查租、解决群众困难后，群众生产情绪大为提高；安国三区四十五个村庄中，即有四十一个村成立了互助组。安平一区二十五村组织了三六三个组。由群众自愿组合，不拘形式。此种组织，在高阳更为普遍，据四月中旬的统计：全县约有百分之三十以上的村庄均组织了男女生产互助组。抗属、贫民、孤寡的生产困难亦在互助中得到解决。安国劳动英雄于致祥，团结了刘家佐村的一百一十九户人家（共二八一户）成立了十个互助组，四个妇女纺织组，从农业互助上又组织了轧花、织布、卷烟，运销等十一个组的生产，在这些互助中，农业与各种小商业、手工业的结合，更为密切。如安平一区二十五个村的互助组中，与农业结合的有织箩底、织毛巾、织布、轧花、作牙刷、卷烟、榨油、打坯、烧窑、运销等二十五种之多。许多村庄的手工业和家庭副业采用了小型合作社的互助经营形式。今年各地从春耕开始以来，不但播种及时，而且在副业上亦增加很大收入。
