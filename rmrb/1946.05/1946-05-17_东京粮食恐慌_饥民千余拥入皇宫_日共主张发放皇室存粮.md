　　Tokyo Food Panic
    Over a Thousand Starving People Flock to the Imperial Palace
    Japanese Communist Party Advocates Releasing Imperial Family Food Reserves
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Fourteenth] Tokyo dispatch: Twelve hundred Japanese people in the southwest district of Tokyo held a mass meeting on the 12th due to the food shortage and the delay in food distribution. After the meeting, they held a demonstration and procession and flocked to the Imperial Palace, demanding that the Japanese Emperor open the food reserves and provide food for the starving people. During negotiations with officials inside the palace, representatives of the demonstrators strongly protested against the palace guards for preventing people from entering the Imperial Palace. The Japanese people flocking to the Imperial Palace to petition is an unprecedented event in Japanese history.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Fourteenth] According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 12th, demanding that the new cabinet be headed by the Socialist Party, with the participation of the Communist Party, to form a democratic government. The statement said: The Communist Party regards the abolition of the Emperor system as its own responsibility, but as long as the Japanese Emperor still has the power to appoint the Prime Minister according to the Constitution, the Japanese Communist Party should make demands not only to Kijūrō Shidehara, but also to Hirohito. The statement pointed out that Shidehara had rejected the party's demand on April 10 for the establishment of a Socialist Party and Communist Party government, so it was necessary to make demands directly to the Emperor. Demonstrations were then held not only outside the Prime Minister's official residence, but also in front of the Imperial Palace and the Minister of the Imperial Household. The statement then demanded the release of the large amount of food reserves of the Japanese Imperial Family to relieve the famine and resolve the serious food shortage.

　　东京粮食恐慌
    饥民千余拥入皇宫
    日共主张发放皇室存粮
    【新华社延安十四日电】东京讯：东京西南区一千二百日人，为粮荒与食粮分配之稽延，于十二日召开群众大会，会后举行示威游行，并拥入皇宫，要求日皇打开库存食米，供给饥饿人民食用。在与宫内的官员谈判时，示威群众代表对宫门卫士阻止人民进入皇宫来，提出严重抗议。日本人民拥入皇宫请愿，系日本历史上之创举。
    【新华社延安十四日电】据合众社东京讯：日共于十二日发表声明，要求新阁以社会党为首，并有共产党参加之民主政府。声明称：共产党当以取消天皇制为己任，但只要日皇还有依据宪法任命首相之权，日共当不仅向币原，而且亦向裕仁提出要求。声明指出币原已拒绝该党四月十日所提出成立社会党与共产党政府之要求，故有直接向日皇提出要求之必要。此后不仅在首相官邸门外，且在皇宫及宫内大臣门前举行示威运动。声明继即要求发放日皇皇室之大批存粮，以救济饥民和解救严重的粮荒。
