　　Katayama Cabinet Formation Stalled
    Japanese Communist Party Strongly Advocates for a Coalition Cabinet
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] Tokyo News: The leader of the Japanese Socialist Party has been negotiating with the Japanese Communist Party regarding the formation of a cabinet. The Japanese Communist Party strongly advocates for the establishment of a democratic government based on a democratic front and opposes the proposal of the Socialist Party cooperating with war criminals within the Liberal Party. Furthermore, after the Japanese Communist Party's request to form a democratic front cabinet with the Socialist Party was repeatedly rejected by Shidehara, this request has now been re-submitted. Tokuda Kyuichi, the General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, warned Shidehara, "You have already resigned, therefore you have no right to impose any conditions on the issue of cabinet formation." Okano Susumu, a leader of the Japanese Communist Party, stated, "If you do not clarify your attitude, we will go directly to the Emperor and debate with him." Shidehara has not yet responded.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] Comprehensive Report: After Shidehara decided that Katayama, the secretary of the Socialist Party (previously translated as the Social Democratic Party, hereafter all translated as the current name), should form a cabinet, according to Reuters and Associated Press reports, fierce struggles have broken out within the Socialist Party. Left-wing leaders such as Kato Kanju and the masses they lead strongly advocate for the establishment of a coalition cabinet with the Japanese Communist Party and other democratic parties, and advocate that the Emperor officially appoint Katayama to form a cabinet after an agreement is reached. Right-wing figures such as Hirano and Kono Mitsu (note: they were behind-the-scenes figures who plotted the war of aggression against China) advocate forming a cabinet in coalition with the Liberal Party and urge the Emperor to immediately move Katayama to form a cabinet. Some individuals from the centrist-leaning-left faction, such as Mizutani Chozaburo, advocate for the Socialist Party to be the mainstay of the new cabinet, forming a cabinet in coalition with the Liberal Party and the Cooperative National Party, while also accommodating the Japanese Communist Party. In order to strive for the realization of a democratic coalition cabinet, the Japanese Communist Party has put forward compromise conditions to Katayama, that is, if Katayama agrees to postpone the discussion of the constitution (the Emperor is scheduled to convene a temporary new parliament on the 15th of this month to discuss abolishing the Emperor's privileges from the conditions of the new constitution), the Japanese Communist Party can allow the existence of a royal family like in Britain.

　　片山组阁搁浅
    日共力主联合内阁
    【新华社延安十二日电】东京讯：日本社会党领导人，日来与日共谈判组织新闻问题，日共力主在民主阵线的基础上，建立民主政府，并反对社会党与自由党内战犯合作的提议。又讯：日共与社会党合组民主阵线内阁的要求，被币原屡次拒绝后，现在又重提此一要求，日共总书记德田球一向币原警告称：“你已经辞职，因此你对新闻组成问题，无权强施任何条件”。日共领袖冈野进称：“如果你不表明态度，我们就要到天享那里直接和他辩论去”，币原迄未置答。
    【新华社延安十一日电】综合报导：币原决定社会党（前译社会民主党，以后均改现译名）书记片山组阁后，据路透合众社报导：社会党内部已展开激烈的斗争。加藤勘十等左派领袖和领导的群众，坚主与日共等民主党派成立联合内阁，并主张待成立协议后，日皇再正式任命片山组阁。而平野、河野密等右派（按他们曾是策任命侵华战争之幕后人物），则主张与自由党联合组阁，并敦促日皇立即动片山组阁。水谷长三郎等中派偏左的一部分人士，主张新阁中以社会党为主干，联合自由党和国民协同党组阁，同时容纳日共。日共为争取民主联合内阁的实现，曾对片山提出妥协条件，即片山如同意宪法延期讨论（日皇定本月十五日召集临时新议会，讨论从新宪法条件中废除天皇特权），日共可以允许如英国式的皇室存在。
