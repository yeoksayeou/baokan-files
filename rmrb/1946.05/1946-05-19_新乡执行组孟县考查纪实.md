　　A Record of the Xinxiang Executive Group's Inspection in Meng County
    Yù Míng
    On March 25th, the Xinxiang group went to Meng County for investigation. The jeep departed from Xinxiang and arrived in Xiuwu County town in a little over an hour.

    "Report, a conflict occurred in Qian Dong Village, fifteen li southwest of Xiuwu. The Eighth Route Army attacked the National Army. Please send the group to investigate." This was the report from Chen, the regiment commander of the National Army garrisoned in Xiuwu, and Xu Wentao, the county magistrate.

    The tone of the report made it sound like a very serious matter.

    "We'll go where there's gunfire," said American representative Colonel Wilson. The representatives of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed. Xu Wentao also accompanied them. When they arrived at Qian Dong Village, it was garrisoned by Yang Yijiu's puppet troops, the people's executioner of Xiuwu, while Chen Fan Bridge to the west of the village was the Eighth Route Army's garrison. However, there was no sign of the Eighth Route Army attacking the puppet troops. Only the roads, big and small, connecting Qian Dong Village and Chen Fan Bridge had been destroyed by the puppet troops. At this point, the American representative became suspicious and asked the puppet troops' lieutenant colonel regimental deputy:

    "How many troops do you have stationed in Qian Dong Village?"

    "One regiment," the puppet lieutenant colonel replied.

    "How many soldiers of the Eighth Route Army are in Chen Ru Bridge?"

    "Twenty or thirty men. The Eighth Route Army attacks Qian Dong Village every night!"

    Wilson smiled coldly and retorted, "You have a regiment and so many fortifications, and you're still building fortifications (at this time, forty or fifty people were building bunkers beside the three representatives). Do they dare to come and fight you with just twenty or thirty men? You just said there was a conflict here, where did it happen!"

    At this time, the puppet lieutenant colonel and the Kuomintang magistrate of Xiuwu County looked at each other, their faces turning red, speechless, standing there like wooden chickens. It was like a slapstick comedy of a dog biting a rubber ball—no meat was eaten, but they got a bellyful of anger and looked utterly defeated.

    After this embarrassing situation, they were not reconciled, still wanting to pin the blame for destroying peace on the Eighth Route Army. Suddenly, they shifted their target and complained to Wilson, "The Eighth Route Army is blockading traffic, and the people on both sides cannot travel freely. Please stop them, Colonel."

    It was already three o'clock in the afternoon. The group had to hurry to Jiaozuo that day, so they returned to Xiuwu for lunch. When the jeep was five or six li away from Qian Dong Village, Colonel Wilson saw four large carts coming from the west and immediately called the driver to ask:

    "Where are you coming from?"

    "From Jiaozuo."

    "Is this road to Jiaozuo easy to travel?"

    "Yes, it is."

    "What's on the carts?"

    "Coal."

    Then, he saw large carts transporting coal from the coal station in the liberated area in the west to the east, one after another. Colonel Wilson saw that coal from Jiaozuo could be exported to the Kuomintang area in large quantities, and the transportation was very convenient. He couldn't help but smile and say, "This is very good, very good!"

    So, the guys who wanted to shift the blame again got nowhere.

    After the group finished eating in Xiuwu, they set off for Jiaozuo. Seven or eight li outside Xiuwu City, they entered the liberated area. There were only two sentries at the border, and the commander of the garrison, who had been waiting here with great anticipation for more than four hours, greeted them thirty li away. Along the way, the people, men and women, old and young, welcomed the peace envoys with the same feeling, hoping that they would bring them peace and that the Kuomintang would drive away the puppet troops who were ravaging the people as soon as possible. Although the weather was gloomy that day and the spring chill was still strong, their hopes were still so high.

    Around five o'clock, the jeep arrived in Jiaozuo. The warm welcome from the local military and political leaders and the masses formed a contrasting scene to the situation in the Kuomintang area. The so-called petitioning "masses" in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were composed of hooligans, landlords, and disreputable people, all under unified arrangements, deliberately smearing saliva under their eyes to fake tears, each one like a ventriloquist, recounting the words of the people behind them.

    Due to the rain, they didn't reach their destination—Meng County—until the afternoon of the 28th.

    Brigade Commander Zhao Lantian and Meng County Magistrate Xu Songtao presented a report to the group. The report, with ironclad facts, narrated the Kuomintang's violation of the ceasefire order, crossing the Yellow River on January 14th to invade Meng County, and our side's inevitable recovery of Meng County, as well as the crimes of Zhang Bohua, who colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country. This long report was filled with blood and tears, and no one could remain indifferent after reading it. In the evening, hundreds and thousands of people welcomed the representatives of the group, with tens of millions of people sharing one heart, hoping that the Kuomintang troops would implement the ceasefire order and retreat to the south of the Yellow River, to their original defense lines of the 13th.

    On the 29th, the group inspected our army's front lines, and we saw people singing on the roads and farmers plowing in the fields, a scene of peace. But in the afternoon, when we arrived in the area of the Kuomintang's 90th Army, the atmosphere of war was very strong, making one feel as if they were walking on a detonated grenade. Look: on both sides of the road, in the middle of the streets, the docks were next to the bunkers, the chevaux-de-frise followed by chevaux-de-frise, and there were continuous deep ditches and high walls. How could traffic be smooth! Wilson, seeing this situation, felt that the opinion of the CCP representative, Major General Huang Zhen, that traffic could not be restored without dismantling the bunkers in the Kuomintang area was correct.

    On the morning of the 1st, so-called mass representatives were received and investigated at the resident of the Kuomintang's 90th Army 53rd Division.

    "When did the 53rd Division cross the river?" Wilson asked.

    "January 13th."
    "January 13th."

    Many representatives answered in unison, all speaking in the Gregorian calendar.

    "Are the people here so advanced?" Major General Huang Zhen questioned, "The vast majority of Chinese villagers only know the lunar calendar and not the Gregorian calendar. Why is it the opposite here? This fact fully proves that these so-called representatives have obviously been uniformly trained, and what they are saying is completely fabricated. Please pay attention to this, Colonel Wilson."

    The Kuomintang representatives were speechless.

    Colonel Wilson laughed heartily.

    Wilson then asked two representatives in detail. They both replied that when the 53rd Division crossed the Yellow River, the north bank was the Eighth Route Army, and there was fighting during the crossing, but the gunfire was not very intense.

    The fact that the Kuomintang army violated the order and attacked Meng County on January 14th is absolutely true. We firmly demand that the Kuomintang consider its credibility and immediately withdraw.

　　新乡执行组孟县考查纪实
    毓明
    三月二十五日，新乡小组去孟县调查。吉普车由新乡动身，一个多钟头，即到了修武县城。
    “报告，修武西南十五里处前董村发生了冲突，八路军向国军进攻，请小组前往调查。”这是修武国民党驻军陈团长及县长徐文涛的报告。
    听这报告的口气，好像煞有介事，非常严重。
    “那里有枪声，我们就往那里去。”美代表威尔逊上校说。国共两代表也同意这个意见。徐文涛氏也伴同前往。到了前董村时，这村驻的是修武人民刽子手伪军杨义九部，村西陈范桥为八路军的驻村。但并无八路军进攻伪军的迹象，只是前董村通陈范桥的大小道路都被伪军破坏了。这时美代表怀疑起来，他问伪军中校团副道：
    “前董村你们驻了多少队伍？”
    “一个团。”伪中校答称。
    “陈茹桥有多少八路军？”
    “二三十人。八路军每天夜晚进攻前董村！”
    威尔逊冷笑了一下，又反问伪中校道：“你们有一个团，又有这样多的工事，现在还在做工事（这时三代表旁边有四五十个老百姓正在修碉堡），他们二三十人敢来打你们吗？你们刚才说这里发生冲突，在什么地方冲突的呀！”
    这时伪中校及国民党修武县长，你看我，我看你，面红耳赤，哑口无言，像木鸡一样呆呆的站着。这像一幕狗咬皮球的滑稽剧——没有吃上肉，却吃了一肚子气，灰腾腾的。
    碰了这一鼻子灰，但他们并不甘心，还想把破坏和平的帽子给八路军戴在头上，忽又转移目标，向威尔逊控诉道：“八路军封锁交通，双方老百姓都不能自由来往，请上校制止。”
    此时已到下午三点，当天小组还要赶到焦作去，即折回修武吃中饭。当吉普车离开前董村五六里时，威尔逊上校见到从西面来了四辆大车，立刻把车夫叫到跟前询问：
    “你们从那里来的？”
    “从焦作来的。”
    “这一条通焦作的大路好走不好走？”
    “好走。”
    “车上里是什么？”
    “煤。”
    接着又远远看见从西面解放区进村煤站向东运煤的大车，络绎而来。威尔逊上校看到焦作的煤可以大批向国民党地区输出，而且交通又很方便，不禁笑着说：“这，顶好顶好！”
    于是想嫁祸于人的家伙，又落了个没趣。
    小组在修武吃罢饭后，即往焦作出发。一出修武城七八里，就进入解放区，边境上只有两个哨兵，还有郊迎三十里的驻军指挥长官，他们早已在这里以满腔热望等候四个多钟头了。沿途老百姓，男男女女，老老少少，也以同样心情在欢迎和平使者，他们希望给他们带来和平，希望国民党早些驱散蹂躏人民的伪军。虽然这天天气阴晦，春寒料峭，但他们的热望仍是那么高。
    约摸五点多钟，吉普车到了焦作。当地军政首长及广大群众，热诚欢迎的盛况，恰和国民党区域的情形，形成了相反的对照。国民党统治区所谓请愿的“群众，”有流氓，有地主，有不三不四的人，都受着统一的安排，故意在眼睛下边抹着唾沫当眼泪，个个像演双簧一样，述说着背后人的话语。
    因天雨，二十八日下午才达到目的地——孟县。
    我赵旅长蓝田和孟县县长徐松涛向小组呈了一个报告。那报告上，用铁的事实述说着国民党违犯停战命令，于元月十四日北渡黄河侵占我孟县和我方于不得已的情况下恢复孟县的经过，还有通敌叛国的张伯华的罪行。这篇长的报告，充满了血泪，谁看了也不能无动于中。晚间，成百成千的群众，欢迎小组各代表几千万人一个心，希望国民党军队执行停战命令，退到黄河以南十三日原防。
    二十九日，小组视察我军前线，见我区行者歌于途，农夫锄于田，一片和平景象。但下午到了国民党九十军地区，这地方，战争气味非常浓厚，使人感到仿佛在拉开火线的炸弹上行走，你看：大路两旁，街道中间，码头挨着碉堡，鹿砦接着鹿砦还并有接连不断的深沟高墙。交通怎样通达呢！威尔逊目睹此种情形，感觉到中共代表黄镇少将所提国民党区不拆碉堡难以恢复交通的意见是正确的。
    一号上午，在国民党九十军五十三师驻地接见所谓群众代表，进行调查。
    “五十三师什么时候渡河的？”威尔逊问。
    “一月十三号。”
    “一月十三号。”
    许多代表异口同声回答着，说的都是阳历。
    “这里老百姓那么进步？”黄镇少将提出质问：“中国广大乡民大多数都只知道阴历。不知道阳历，为什么此地独相反？这事实充分证明，这些所谓代表显系经过统一训练，所说的完全是捏造的事实，请威尔逊上校注意。”
    国民党代表等哑口无言。
    威尔逊上校却大笑不已。
    威尔逊又详细问了两个代表。他们均回答在五十三师过黄河时，河北面是八路军，过河时经过战斗，而目枪声不很激烈。
    国民党军队元月十四日，违令进攻我孟县是千真万确的事实了。我们坚决要求国民党顾全信义立即撤退。
