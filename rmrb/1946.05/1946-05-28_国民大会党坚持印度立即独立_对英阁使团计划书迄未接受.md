　　National Congress Party Insists on Immediate Independence for India; Has Not Yet Accepted British Cabinet Mission Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] New Delhi Dispatch: The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League have not yet indicated their acceptance of the British Cabinet Mission plan. The Congress Working Committee has held four meetings, but has not issued a statement. Gandhi has also held two discussions with the British Cabinet Mission regarding the Congress Working Committee's views on the British plan. According to a report by the United Press, the Congress Party demands: "Immediate declaration of Indian independence, immediate withdrawal of British troops, and the interim government should be a de facto free government, not subject to any constraints." It is said that these demands have been rejected by the British side. In addition, the Congress Party advocates that the United Provinces group should be based on a voluntary basis, rather than being compulsory from the beginning as suggested by the British side, and the princely states should unconditionally obey the central government. A Congress leader described the British plan as a "promissory note," the value of which depends entirely on whether it is based on sincerity: "If it is not based on sincerity, the promissory note can also be torn up and not recognized."

　　国民大会党坚持印度立即独立
    对英阁使团计划书迄未接受
    【新华社延安二十四日电】新德里讯：印度国民大会党与回教同盟对英阁使团的计划书，迄今未表示接受。国大党执行委员会，已举行四次会议，但未发表声明，甘地并就国大党执委会对英计划书的意见，与英阁使团进行两次商讨。据合众社记者报导，国大党方面要求：“立即宣布印度独立，立即撤退英军，临时政府应为实际上的自由政府，而不得受任何束缚”。据称：这些要求已被英方所拒绝。另外，国大党主张联省集团，应基于自愿基础，而不应如英方建议，一开始即带强迫性，藩邦应无条件服从中央政府。国大领袖描述英方计划，为一“期票”，值不值钱，全视是否以诚意为基础：“如非出于诚意，则期票亦可被撕毁而不承认”。
