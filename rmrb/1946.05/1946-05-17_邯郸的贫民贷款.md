　　Handan's Poverty Relief Loans
    Wu Xiang
            A Wooden Beam
    In February of this year, the Handan branch of the Jinnan Bank in Jinnan bought a wooden beam and placed it in the Second Market, intending to use it for building houses. The next day, bank staff discovered that the beam had been moved from its original location and was lying in the stall of a small vendor named Cheng Huian. How did it get there? Cheng Huian invited several people to carry it there. He saw in the evening that no one from the bank was watching over it and, fearing it would be stolen, decided to do so. He also said to everyone, "The bank today is different from the past; it helps us poor people become prosperous. If the beam is stolen, it's a loss for us poor people."
    This Cheng Huian is a loan recipient from the Jinnan Bank. From the time it opened in Handan until the end of April this year, the Jinnan Bank issued a total of 1.7 million yuan in poverty relief loans, distributed to approximately 520 impoverished households, totaling over 4,000 people. The highest loan amount per household was 10,000 yuan, and the lowest was 1,500 yuan. Most loans ranged between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan. A small portion was interest-free, while the majority carried a monthly interest rate of one percent. These loans allowed many impoverished and helpless rickshaw pullers, artisans, and small vendors selling snacks and sundries to maintain and improve their lives, gradually rising economically. According to inspections in individual areas at the end of April, those who managed their businesses poorly broke even after covering living expenses; those who managed them well earned profits close to the principal amount, in addition to their living expenses. Therefore, almost all loans were repaid on time, without any delays. Song Pingfang in the train station area was extremely worried in December of last year because he had no rice or firewood. He borrowed 2,000 yuan from the bank, made iron cage fences, and four months later, he repaid the loan. After deducting living expenses for his family of three, he still had 2,500 yuan in cash and raw materials.
    From this, we can understand why Cheng Huian wanted to move the wooden beam bought by the bank to his stall. We can also understand why all the loan recipients were so affectionate towards the bank staff. During the New Year, loan recipients would desperately try to pull the bank staff into their homes, saying, "My house is dirty, and I don't have anything good to eat, but you can at least sit down!"
            New Problems
    The democratic government of the liberated areas, leading all the people, sharing weal and woe, and overcoming the consecutive severe disasters of 1942 and 1943, is a miracle in Chinese history. However, under the pressure of famine in the enemy-occupied areas, large numbers of bankrupt farmers had no choice but to leave their homes, already devoid of everything, with tears in their eyes, and go to the transportation lines to work as coolies or pull rickshaws for a living. Thus, the number of poor people in Handan increased. Although there are no precise statistics, there are at least 7,000 people, not counting the surrounding villages, with the most coming from Daming. These people suffered the oppression of the enemy and puppets and struggled on the brink of starvation day and night. Now that they are liberated and have received loans from the bank, they can at least set up a small stall to sell snacks and sundries. In fact, most of them are setting up small stalls because: (1) the poor lack capital, and this kind of business requires the least capital; (2) it doesn't require any special skills, and men, women, the elderly, and the young can all participate; (3) the profit is reliable; if there are buyers, there is profit, and there is no risk of losing money. However, as the number of vendors continues to increase, sales are limited, which inherently creates competition and lowers profits. Thus, a new problem is raised: after the masses have solved their urgent living difficulties, they demand more loans to do bigger business and get rich faster. However, the scope of activity of the average poor person is small, their commercial experience is not rich, and in the face of fluctuating prices, the risk of losing money far outweighs the hope of making money.
    To solve this problem and overcome this speculative tendency, we need to guide them from operating consumer goods to production, adopt a business model based on labor and supplemented by capital, and develop transportation, handicraft production, and small workshops.
    However, how should we start doing this?
    In mid-March, Liu Yushan of Gu Yi Shi (second-hand clothing market) requested a loan to fry sesame candy. After investigation, the comrades of the Handan branch of the Jinnan Bank learned that he had a small earthen cart, was physically strong, and was from Daming. Therefore, they advised him to engage in transportation, transporting coal from Handan to Daming and selling oil on the return trip, once every ten days, earning around a thousand yuan besides his living expenses. With his agreement, he was loaned 5,000 yuan for a term of three months. After a month and a half, they went to check and found that his inventory and cash exceeded 7,000 yuan. He said very excitedly, "The plan the bank helped me make is really good; I'm sure I can earn 5,000 yuan in three months."
    Zhang Qin was also from Gu Yi Shi. He requested a loan in early April to set up a small stall. The comrades from the bank discovered that his neighbor had a mill that happened to be lacking a livestock animal. So, they advised him to partner with his neighbor and loaned him 10,000 yuan to buy a donkey. The neighbor was also very happy. He recently ran to the bank and said, "There's no problem; I'll definitely earn the cost of the donkey back in three months."
    Concrete facts clarify the path that people have already been exploring. And they suggest what the correct approach should be.
            Democratic Appraisal and Group Leaders
    Who should get a loan? How much should they get? Only by adopting the mass line can it be resolved satisfactorily.
    The first batch of loans had a relief nature, and were issued as soon as Handan was liberated. The bank sent people to work with comrades leading mass work, issuing loans on one hand and organizing the masses on the other. Loans were subject to democratic appraisal by each group. The groups were divided according to residence, and everyone was a neighbor and very familiar with each other. Therefore, the allocation of loans would be fair and reasonable, and the use would be clear, so that people wouldn't borrow money without working. Asking them to find shop guarantors would be unreasonable. In fact, they supervise each other, creating a chain guarantee, which is even better than shop guarantors. "Borrow well and repay well, and it will be easy to borrow again" is already a very loud slogan among them. A former puppet soldier from Jiao Yao Jie (Jiao Kiln Street) requested a loan. Many people said during the appraisal, "The bank's loans are to help us poor people turn over and become prosperous. You were a traitor. If you don't repent and reform, you can't be given a loan."
    After discovering loyal and reliable activists in the groups, they were further cultivated to become a bridge connecting the bank and the masses. The method was to constantly talk to them about the bank's loan policies, increase their political awareness and sense of responsibility, understand other borrowers through them, and entrust them to introduce new borrowers. During the election of the loan group, these activists would often be elected as group leaders. These group leaders became the best assistants for the bank's loan work. For example, He Rongtian of Gu Yi Shi and Zhang Ming of Xi Xie Zhuang (West Xie Village) often went to each household in their group to check, inquiring about their business conditions, introducing the business methods of other households, helping them make plans, and urging them to repay the loans on time, carrying out all the work that the bank needed to do but could not.
            Further Steps
    On the evening of May 6th, the Banking Operations Department conducted a review and study of the loan work in Handan City.
    It can be said that the work has been very successful. However, they also raised the following points:
    1. The distribution of loans has not been completely fair. Group leaders are relatively active, but sometimes they cannot take care of more people. Some people who are desperately poor haven't received a single penny, while some families of three have borrowed three times under different names. Therefore, they decided to send people to do more in-depth visits among the masses and conduct further checks and education on the group leaders.
    2. Making loans develop towards production has not been done seriously. If it has been done, it is only the beginning; it is not systematic or planned. Therefore, after research, they divided the loans into three standards: (1) those who have production conditions but lack funds; (2) those who have neither production conditions nor funds; (3) those who operate consumer goods. Loan recipients who meet the first two standards will be given preferential treatment in terms of amount and duration, while the latter will be treated more strictly. And they will continue to promote the spirit of in-depth investigation and research, guiding the masses to engage in production.
    People who faithfully serve the people often review their work in such a courageous and serious manner. And this review helps them to better serve the people further.

　　邯郸的贫民贷款
    吴象
            一根木梁
    今年二月间冀南银行邯郸支行买了一根木梁放在第二商场，准备作建筑房屋之用。第二天银行的人发现木梁离开原来的位置，躺在小贩程慧安的席棚里了。怎么去的呢？程慧安邀了几个人抬去的。他晚间看见银行没有人来看管，怕被小偷抬走，便决定这样做。并且对大家说：“如今的银行和过去不一样，是帮助咱穷人发家翻身的，木梁如果被偷走了，也是咱穷人的损失。”
    这个程慧安是冀南银行的贷户。冀南银行从邯郸开放到本年四月底，一共发放了贫民贷款一百七十万元，分配给贫苦的五百二十户约四千余人。每户贷得的数目最高的是一万元，最少的是一千五百元，一般多在三千至五千元之间，小部分没有利息，大部分是月息一分，这些贷款，使许多贫苦无告的排车夫，手工业者，出售零食和杂货的小摊贩，得以维持并改善生活，在经济上逐渐上升。根据四月终个别地区的检查，经营不得法的，除吃用外不赔本；经营得法的，吃用之外，能获得近于本金的利润。因此，几乎所有的贷款，都能如期归还，没有拖延的现象。车站区宋平方，去年十二月柴米无着，忧愁万分。从银行贷去二千元，编制铁罩篱，四个月之后，他归还了贷款，除去了一家三口的吃用开消外，手中尚余现款和原料二千五百元。
    从这里就可以知道程慧安为什么要把银行买的木梁抬到他的席棚里去了。也就可以知道为什么所有的贷户对银行的人都这样亲热了。过年的时候，贷户一看到银行的人，没有不拚死命拉的：“家里脏，也没有好吃的，坐一坐总可以呀！”
            新的问题
    解放区的民主政府领导着全体人民，同甘共苦，战胜四二年四三年连续的严重的灾荒，是中国历史上的奇迹，但在敌占区灾荒的逼迫下，大批破产的农民，却只得带着眼泪离开自己已经一无所有的家园。到交通线上去当苦力或拉人力车谋生。这样邯郸的贫民就增加起来了。虽然没有精确的统计，但不算四乡，至少也有七千多人。其中以大名的最多。这些人受尽敌伪的压榨，日夕在饥饿线上挣扎，现在解放了，又得到银行的贷款，最少可以摆个出售零食的杂货小摊了。事实上也是摆小摊子的最多，这因为：（１）贫民资本缺乏，这种生意需要资本最少；（２）不需要什么特殊技术，男女老弱都可以参加；（３）利润可靠，有买的就有赚的，不致蚀本。但小贩不断增加，销售有限，无形中形成竞争而使利润降低。于是，新的问题被提出来了：群众解决了迫切的生活困难之后，要求更多的贷款，做更大的买卖，更快的发家，然而一般贫民活动范围小，商业经验不丰富，在物价涨跌不定的情况下，赔本的危险大大超过了赚钱的希望。
    解决这个问题，克服这一投机的倾向，就需要诱导他们从经营消费品走向生产，采用以劳动力为主、资本为辅的经营方式，发展运输，发展手工业生产和小型作坊。
    然而，应该怎样着手去做呢？
    三月中旬估衣市刘玉山要求贷款炸麻糖。冀南银行支行的同志经过调查，了解他有一辆小土车，自己体强力壮，是大名人，于是劝他搞运输，从邯郸运煤到大名，回来贩油，十天一次，除吃用可赚千元上下。经他同意贷给他五千元，期限三个月。一个半月之后去检查，他手中的存货和现款超过了七千元，他非常兴奋的说：“银行帮我订的计划真好，三个月准能赚五千元。”
    张勤也是估衣市的，他在四月初要求贷款摆小摊，银行的同志发现他的邻居是磨坊，恰巧正缺个牲口，于是就劝他和邻居合伙，贷给他一万元买毛驴，邻居也很高兴，他最近跑到银行来说：“没有问题，三个月一定能把毛驴赚出来。”
    具体的事实，明确了人们所已经摸索到的出路。并且提示了怎样才是正确的做法。
            民主评议和小组长
    谁该贷？贷多少？只有采取群众路线，才能圆满解决。
    第一批贷款带有救济的性质，邯郸一解放就开始发放了。银行派人跟领导群众工作的同志一起，一面发款一面就把群众组织起来。贷款经各小组民主评议。小组是按住地划分的，大家都是邻居，互相非常了解，因此贷款的分配，就会公平合理，用途也会明确，不致借了钱不干活。要求他们找铺保是不近人情的事实上他们互相监督，连环保证，比铺保还好。“好借好还，再借不难。”在他们中间已经是很响亮的口号了。焦窑街有一个曾经当过伪军的要求贷款。许多人在评议时说：“银行贷款是帮助咱穷人翻身发家，你当过汉奸，如果不悔过自新就不能贷给你。”
    在小组中发现忠实可靠的积极分子之后，便又进一步去培养他，使之成为银行与群众连系的桥梁。方法是不断同他谈银行贷款的政策，提高其政治觉悟与责任心，通过他去了解别的贷户，委托他去介绍新的贷户。在贷款小组选举的时候，这些积极分子往往都会当选为小组长，这样的小组长就成了银行贷款工作最好的助手。如估衣市的贺荣田，西谢庄的张明，都经常到本组各户去检查，关切地询问他们的经营状况，介绍别户的经营方法，帮助他们订计划，督促他们按时还款。进行了一切银行所必需做而做不到的工作。
            再进一步
    五月六日的晚上，银行业务处对邯郸市的贷款工作作了一次检讨和研究。
    可以说，工作是很有成绩的了。但是，他们同时提出：
    一、贷款的分配还没有做到完全公道。小组长都比较有活动能力，有时却照顾不到更多的人。有穷得没有办法的，没有贷到一个钱，有的一家三口，却顶名贷了三次。因此他们决定派人到群众中去做更深入的访问，并对小组长作进一步的检查与教育。
    二、使贷款向生产上发展。还没有认真的做，如果做，也只有开始，还没有系统，没有计划。因此，他们经过研究把贷款分成三个标准：（一）有生产条件而没有资金的；（二）既没有生产条件又没有资金的；（三）经营消费品的。对前两个标准的贷户在数目及期限上都加以优待，对后者则比较严格。并且继续发扬深入调查研究的精神，诱导群众从事生产。
    忠诚为人民服务的人，常常是这样勇敢而认真的去检讨自己的工作。而这种检讨又帮助他进一步更好的去为人民服务。（本文根据冀南银行业处集体讨论及倪惊涛同志的材料。）
