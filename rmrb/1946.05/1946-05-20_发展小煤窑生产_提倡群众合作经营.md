　　Develop Small Coal Mine Production
    Promote Mass Cooperative Management
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the peaceful construction, the mass-based coal mine production in the Border Region has greatly developed, considerably solving the fuel problem of the masses in most areas of Taihang and Taiyue. At the recent Border Region Coal Industry Conference, Vice Chairman Rong pointed out regarding the operational direction of small-scale coal mining that under the current circumstances of underdeveloped mechanized mining and inconvenient transportation, developing small-scale mines is still a need of the broad masses. The small-scale mining production method is simple, requiring little capital. Attention should be paid to mobilizing the masses for cooperative management and supporting private management, especially in areas where mass mobilization is relatively thorough and organized, where there is more surplus labor. The masses can be mobilized to cooperate in mining with capital and labor. The narrow-minded view of fearing private investment should be overcome. When necessary, the government can also provide loans to support mass production.

　　发展小煤窑生产
    提倡群众合作经营
    【本报讯】边区群众性煤窑生产，和平建设以来有很大发展，相当解决了太行太岳大部地区群众的燃料问题。在最近召开的边区煤业会上，戎副主席对小窑煤业的经营方向，指出在目前机器开采不发达，交通运输不便的情况下，发展小窑仍是广大群众的需要。小窑生产方式简单，所需资本不多，应注意发动群众合作经营及扶植私人经营，尤其在群众发动比较充分和组织起来的地区，劳力较有剩余，可动员群众以资本劳力合作开采，要克服害怕私人投资的狭隘观点。必要时政府还可贷款扶植群众生产。
