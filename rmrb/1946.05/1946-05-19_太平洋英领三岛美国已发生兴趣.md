　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th】 According to a Reuters report from London on the 14th: American interest in the various Pacific islands currently held by Britain and its Dominions has become front-page news in British newspapers. Most newspapers declare that Britain cannot cede territory to the United States for naval bases, whether in the Pacific or elsewhere. A Washington source claims that authoritative American figures believe that during recent negotiations on the issue of bases, the British side refused to cede sovereignty of three islands in the southwest Pacific – Christmas Island, Guang× Island, and Funafuti Island – to the United States. According to a diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle, the first stage of discussion may be negotiations between the United States and the various Dominions. The correspondent says: American demands are considerable; if similar demands were made by the British side, they might be denounced as imperialist expansion. The News Chronicle believes that it would be a grave error for Britain to cede its Pacific bases to the United States or other countries.

　　太平洋英领三岛美国已发生兴趣
    【新华社延安十六日电】据路透社伦敦十四日电：美国对现为英国及各自治领所保有的太平洋各岛之发生兴趣，已成为英国各报的首页消息，大多数报纸都宣称：无论在太平洋上或其他地方，英国都不能把领土让给美国做海军基地。华盛顿消息称：美权威人士认为英美于最近谈判基地问题时，英方已拒绝将西南太平洋三岛——圣诞岛，广×岛，福那福第岛——的主权让给美国。据新闻纪事报外交记者报导，讨论的第一阶段，可能为美国与各自治领之间的谈判，该记者说：美国的要求是相当大的，如果同样要求被英方提出的话，则可能被骂为帝国主义的扩张。新闻纪事报认为英国若将其太平洋基地让与美国或其他国家，都将是极大的错误。
