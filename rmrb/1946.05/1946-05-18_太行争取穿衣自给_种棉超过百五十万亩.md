　　Taihang Strives for Self-Sufficiency in Clothing
    Cotton Planting Exceeds 1.5 Million Mu
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch, Changzhi News] After a region-wide cotton planting campaign, Taihang's cotton planting achievements this year have surpassed any previous year. Taihang Chief Executive Yuan called on the entire region to plant 1.5 million mu of cotton. According to incomplete statistics, this number has already been exceeded. In Licheng, Pingshun, and other places where there was no cotton planting habit, after profiting from textile production last winter, the masses have clearly understood that cotton planting is an important condition for achieving "耕三余一 (gēng sān yú yī)" [cultivate for three and have surplus for one], and clothing self-sufficiency. Therefore, they have planted a large amount of cotton this year. Licheng County's six districts planned to plant 30,000 mu of cotton, and the plan has now been exceeded. One district alone planted more than 10,000 mu. Langzhuang Village, which profited the most from cotton planting last year, has converted 56% of its autumn land into cotton fields this year. Sun Yunjin, a 60-year-old man from Zizhen Village, planted one mu of cotton last year, and the harvest was equivalent to six mu of grain. This year, he planted ten mu on his own. After the Fourth District of Pingshun held a cotton field promotion training class, the number of cotton planting households quickly increased from two to 3,432 households; the original plan for 2,000 mu of cotton fields actually increased to more than 4,600 mu. The Niu Deng agricultural cooperative in X Village plans that each household plants more than one mu of cotton. Based on last year's minimum yield of 30 jin of raw cotton per mu, they can cover their own clothing needs and have a surplus. Liu Caibang, a labor hero from Jingdian Village in She County, led the entire village in carrying water to plant 800 mu of cotton last year despite the drought, gaining fame throughout Taihang. This year, he has led the entire village to plant more than 1,900 mu of cotton, and is still rushing to plant. Xihuangzhang Village in Zuoquan has specifically designated a cotton planting area, and the cotton fields have exceeded six times last year's acreage. The first district of Linbei planted 3,000 mu, and Zhao Village planted an average of one mu per person. In the vast newly liberated cotton-producing areas, such as northern Henan and western Hebei, especially in Wu'an and other places, cotton fields accounted for nearly 70% of all cultivated land before the war. However, in the past eight years, under the destruction of the enemy and puppets, the cotton fields have been greatly reduced. In the first year after liberation, the democratic government actively led cotton planting and issued huge amounts of loans. The Third Special Administrative Office also promulgated measures to encourage cotton planting: for cotton fields with a general grain burden of less than 16 jin of raw cotton per mu, the burden is waived, and cotton can be used instead of grain to pay the burden, with the price of cotton being 6% higher than the market price. If the cotton cannot be sold, the government will purchase it at the market price; if the cotton yield per mu is lower than the value of grain, the government will be responsible for compensating its losses. With such incentives from the government, the masses in cotton-producing areas are enthusiastic about planting cotton. In Wu'an alone, 57,000 mu have been planted, and the rest of northern Henan and western Hebei are still rushing to plant.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 10th] According to incomplete statistics: In more than 20 counties in Jin-Sui, more than 450,000 mu of cotton fields have been fully planted, doubling the amount from last year. In the newly liberated counties of Wenshui, Fenyang, Zhongyang, Xiaoyi, and Pingyao, the democratic government adjusted cotton fields and cotton seeds, resulting in a sudden increase from 30,000 mu of cotton fields under enemy occupation to 130,000 mu. In the old cotton planting areas of Lin County and other places in the Third Sub-district, the original plan was to plant a total of 100,000 mu of cotton, but Lin County alone has planted 110,000 mu. Originally, only Lishi, Linnan, and Xing County in Jin-Sui planted 30,000 mu of cotton. In 1944, Lin County, Hequ, Baode, and other counties were added, with a total of 150,000 mu of cotton planted. Last year, 13 counties including Lan County, Kelan, Fangshan, Jingning, Xinzhou, Jingle, Yangqu, Jiaocheng, Qingyuan, and Taiyuan were added, and the entire region had more than 218,000 mu of cotton fields.

　　太行争取穿衣自给
    种棉超过百五十万亩
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社长治讯】经过全区普遍植棉运动，太行今年植棉成绩，超过以往任何一年。太行行长原号召全区种棉一百五十万亩，现在据不完全统计，业已超过此数。向无种棉习惯的黎城、平顺等地，经过去年冬季纺织获利后，群众思想上已明确种棉是实现耕三余一、穿衣自给的重要条件，因之今年都大量植棉，黎城全县六个区计划种棉三万亩，现已超过计划。仅一区即种一万余亩。去年植棉获利最大的郎庄村，今年全村秋地百分之五十六成为棉田。子镇村六十岁老人孙云锦，去年种棉一亩，收成顶六亩谷，今年一人种了十亩。平顺四区召开了推广棉田训练班后，植棉户由两户迅速增到三千四百三十余户；原定棉田两千亩结果增植到四千六百余亩。×村牛等则组每户平均种一亩多花，按去年最低产量，每亩卅斤净花计算，可以顾住自己用穿还有余。涉县井店村劳动英雄刘才榜，去年天旱领导全村担水栽棉八百亩，名传太行；今年领导全村种棉已达一千九百余亩，现在还在抢种。左权西黄漳村特辟植棉区，棉田超过去年六倍。林北一区种了三千亩，赵家村每人平均种一亩。广大新解放的产棉区，如豫北、冀西，特别是武安等地，战前棉田几占全部耕田百分之七十，但八年来在敌伪摧残下棉田大为缩小。解放后的第一年，民主政府积极领导植棉，并发放巨量贷款，三专署并颁布奖励植棉办法：棉田一般应产粮负担每亩不足十六斤净花者，负担免交，并可以棉代粮，缴纳负担，花价高于市价百分之六。如棉花售不出者，政府按市价收买；如每亩棉产低于谷物值价时，政府负责赔偿其损失。产棉地区群众在政府如此奖励下，植棉情绪高涨，仅武（安）西一地，即下种五万七千亩，豫北冀西各地现仍在抢种中。
    【新华社兴县十日电】据不完全统计：晋绥二十余县，已有四十五万亩棉田全部下种，比去年增加一倍。新解放区之文水、汾阳、中阳、孝义、平遥五县，由于民主政府调剂棉田棉籽，已由敌占时三万亩棉田突增至十三万亩。三分区之临县等地老植棉区，原计划共植棉十万亩，现仅临县就种棉十一万亩。按晋绥原只离石、临南、兴县三县植棉三万亩，四四年增加临县、河曲、保德等县，共种棉十五万亩。去年增加岚县、岢岚、方山、静宁、忻县、静乐、阳曲、交城、清源、太原等十三县，全区共有棉田二十一万八千余亩。
