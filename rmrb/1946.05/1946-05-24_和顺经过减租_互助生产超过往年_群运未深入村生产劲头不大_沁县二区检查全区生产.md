　　Heshun's mutual aid production movement has now exceeded any previous year. Out of the county's 202 administrative villages, 21,252 households, and 83,724 people, 14,172 households, or 28,910 people, have been organized. The number of people participating in mutual aid accounts for more than 34% of the county's population. The county currently has 6 mutual aid societies, 122 labor exchange teams, and 1,749 mutual aid groups. According to the degree of organization, the villages can be divided into three categories: 88 villages where rent reduction has been relatively thorough, the masses are highly aware, and they recognize the importance of organizing production, so mutual aid organizations are also relatively consolidated. In 75 villages, rent reduction still has outstanding problems and is not thorough enough, the masses have poor awareness, and mutual aid is mostly organized by cadres through administrative means. In addition, there are 39 villages where rent reduction is very incomplete, and the masses have low enthusiasm for production. Therefore, in the midst of the great production campaign, the county is still combining it with rent reduction, hoping to implement rent reduction thoroughly and further organize the masses.
　　[Our Yangcheng Dispatch] The Second District of Qin County inspected the district's production work on April 16th. The inspection results are as follows: (1) A total of 157 mutual aid groups have been organized throughout the district, with 1,193 people. Among them, the development is most widespread in the six villages of Xilin, Northwest, Hougou, Beiji, Wusu, and Gu County Town. Xilin is better than the other villages. The village has organized 13 groups, with 78 people, accounting for more than 80% of the male able-bodied labor force in the village. The method of organization is voluntary association. Wang Binghe, Wang Xinghe and others combine groups according to their close proximity to their residence, calling on everyone to organize mutual aid. From the group develops into a brigade. The village has elected Wang Binghe as the brigade leader to lead the village's mutual aid group to carry out production. Secondly, the mutual aid groups of Jiang Haijin and Huang Gengyou in Gu County Town, and the Wang Xingyuan mutual aid group in Beiji, are also developing well. (2) In the popularization of cotton planting, they first carried out cotton seed regulation. In addition to the government's assistance in regulating 6,000 jin, they also called on the masses to personally transport 6,300 jin of raw cotton seeds from Huo County. They have all been planted, totaling 5,131 mu of cotton. Among them, the six villages of Northwest, Nanji, Shangzhuang, Nanren, Guozhuang, Houquan, and Liancun have planted the most cotton. Northwest Liancun alone planted more than 600 mu. A small village, Shigou, with 16 households, planted 55 mu, an average of 2 mu per household. The task of one mu per household on average in the district has been fully completed. In terms of technical guidance for cotton planting, the district cotton planting instructor holds meetings with village instructors seasonally to study specific matters and personally goes to the countryside to experiment and guide. (3) To promote the "Golden Queen" corn and increase yields, they first carried out seed regulation. It is planned that the district will plant a total of 2,119 mu of "Golden Queen" this year. Xilin plans to completely switch the village's corn to "Golden Queen," totaling 300 mu. Calculating an increase of 5 dou per mu, the district can increase production by 1,059 shi and 5 dou. (4) During the Qingming Festival, people were called to plant trees, guaranteeing that each person would keep one alive. However, because the trees were cut down when the enemy was stationed in Yu'ao Manshui, except for the stationed villages of Xiazhuang, Guozhuang, Nanzhuang, Nanren, and Gu County Town, there was a shortage of trees to plant. According to district statistics, a total of 10,431 trees were planted, with an average of one tree planted for every two people. Among them, Gu County Town carried out collective afforestation, planting more than 1,000 trees on Zishan Mountain. An Baolin, from Wu Ke Village, planted 110 trees alone. (5) For spring plowing loans, the Eighth District loaned a total of 580,000 yuan. According to statistics, 22% was used for agricultural tools, 54% for draft animals, and 4% for fertilizer. Xilin Village loaned 22,000 yuan and bought 7 oxen. The district loaned a total of 68 oxen. In terms of loan methods, the masses organized spring loan committees, determined and posted public notices, and then the masses discussed and proposed opinions. The objects of the loans were mostly poor peasants, families of martyrs, and honored soldiers. The number of loan households has exceeded 20% of the total number of households in the village.

　　和顺经过减租
    互助生产超过往年
    群运未深入村生产劲头不大
    沁县二区检查全区生产
    【本报长治讯】和顺县互助生产运动，目前已超过以往任何一年。全县二百零二个行政村，二万一千二百五十二户，八万三千七百二十四个人中，组织起来的已有一万四千一百七十二户，二万八千九百一十人，参加互助人数，占全县人口百分之三十四强。全县现共有互助社六个，拨工队一百二十二个，互助小组一千七百四十九个。按组织起来的程度，可分为三类村：有八十八村减租已较彻底，群众觉悟较高，认识了组织生产的重要，互助组织亦较巩固。七十五个村减租尚有遗留问题不够深入，群众觉悟较差，互助多系干部包办搞起来的。此外尚有三十九个村减租很不彻底，群众的生产情绪不高。故该县在大生产中，目前仍结合着减租，以期贯彻减租，进一步组织起来。
    【本报阳城讯】沁县二区于四月十六号检查全区生产工作，检查结果如下：（一）全区共已组织互助组一百五十七个，一千一百九十三人，其中以西林、西北、后沟、北集、乌苏、故县镇等六村发展的最普遍。西林又较其他村为好，该村共组织十三组，人数七十八人，占该村男全劳动力百分之八十以上。组织的办法是自愿结合，由王丙和、王兴和等二人按居住邻近结合小组，号召大家组织互助，由小组发展成为大队，现该村已选出王丙和为大队长领导全村互助组，进行生产。其次，故县镇姜海金、黄更有的互助组，北集王兴元互助组，也比较发展的好。（二）在普及植棉上，他们首先进行了棉籽调剂，除政府帮助调剂六千斤外，并号召群众亲往霍县运生棉籽六千三百斤，现已全部下种，共计种棉五千一百三十一亩，其中以西北、南集、上庄、南仁、郭庄、后泉、联村等六村种棉最多，只西北联村即种了六百多亩，寺沟一个小庄十六户人家，就种了五十五亩，每户平均二亩，全区平均每户一亩的任务，已全部完成。在植棉技术指导上，由区植棉指导员，按季节召开村指导员会议，具体研究，并亲自下乡实验指导。（三）推广金皇后玉茭，增加产量，首先进行了种子的调剂，计划今年全区共种金皇后两千一百一十九亩，西林计划全村玉茭完全改种金皇后，计三百亩，以每亩多打五斗计，全区可增产量一千零五十九石五斗。（四）清明号召植树，每人保证栽活一棵，但因敌驻余凹漫水时，树被砍光，除下庄、郭庄、南庄、南仁、故县镇驻村外，都是缺乏树栽，全区统计，共植树一万零四百三十一棵，每两口人平均植树一株，其中故县镇集体造林，在紫山上植树一千余棵，五科村安保林一人，即植树一百一十棵。（五）春耕贷款，八区共贷五十八万元，据统计，用在农具上占百分之二十二，耕畜占百分之五十四，肥料占百分之四，西林全村贷款两万二千元，即买耕牛七头。全区共贷耕牛六十八头。在贷款办法上，都是由群众组织春贷委员会，计定挂榜公布，再由群众讨论提意见，决定对象多是贫苦农民、抗属、荣誉军人，贷款户已超过全村户数百分之二十。
