　　【This Newspaper, Heze News】 Ningyang was a "model county" under long-term enemy-puppet control, where the Baojia system was fully implemented. The masses bore seventy-odd kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies on chickens, dogs, geese, ducks, weddings, and so on, amounting to no less than 200 jin per mu per year. In addition, there were labor burdens such as digging ditches, building walls, standing guard, transporting coal, and guarding railways every day. Coupled with drought and locust plagues, there were consecutive years of poor harvests, corruption by Bao chiefs, and taking advantage of the chaos, resulting in four "many" in Ningyang: (1) Many people seeking work as hired laborers. (More than 4,000 people went to Tai'an alone to seek work). (2) Many people fleeing famine. (3) Many people begging for food. (4) Many traitors. The darkness and chaos were like a living hell. Based on this situation, the county committee decided to first suppress the evil atmosphere and then deepen the movement. First, the enemy's set of Baojia system and exorbitant taxes were abolished. Through anti-traitor accusations and grievance telling, the traitorous ruling apparatus was crushed, and then the movement turned to rent reduction. After the masses understood our policies and propositions, they spontaneously launched a struggle against puppet Bao chiefs. That night, fifty or sixty people went to settle accounts with the Bao chiefs. As the evil atmosphere began to be suppressed and the peasants' morale rose, the leadership seized the moment, struck while the iron was hot, and guided the transition to rent reduction. It was explained to tenants and hired laborers that we were the vanguards of the poor and must first turn over; it was explained to poor and middle peasants that after the victory against traitors, we would help tenants reduce rent and increase wages. The rent reduction struggle against "Master Huang" was organized first, and then expanded to a joint struggle of dozens of villages. "Master Huang" had served as a governor-general, owned more than 200 qing of large mu (equivalent to 600 city qing), and employed more than 200 male and female servants. Some people compared his prestige to that of the Jia family in "Dream of the Red Chamber." He was the most ruthless in exploiting his tenants. His rent was a "living rent," requiring the original rent in bad years and increasing it in good years. If the tenant was unwilling to pay, the land would be taken back immediately. When collecting rent in the village, he would arbitrarily beat, scold, and humiliate the tenants. Xiaohengzhuang was the village of "Master Huang," and the entire village was made up of tenants. These tenants had been farming for four generations, but they were becoming poorer and poorer. In the first generation, all the tenants in the village still had more than 50 mu of land, but now they only had 28 mu. Young men, only two had married wives. The common saying among the men and women, old and young, in this village was: "If we farm for another lifetime, even the roots will be broken." After Xiaohengzhuang was overturned, the tenants set off separately to contact villages outside. In half a month, the rent reduction struggle against Huang's family was victorious in more than a dozen villages! After the victory, more than 800 tenants and hired laborers jointly held a grand meeting to celebrate the victory, overturning more than 300,000 jin of grain. Currently, vigorous rent reduction and wage increase and land return struggles are underway in various districts.

　　掌握运动火候
    宁阳反奸减租紧密结合
    【本报荷泽讯】宁阳是敌伪长期统制的“模范县”，全都实行了保甲制度，鸡、狗、鹅、鸭、嫁娶等等七十余苛捐杂税，群众负担每年每亩不下二百斤，另外还有天天挖沟打墙、站岗、运炭、看铁路等劳役负担，又加旱灾蝗虫，连年不收，保长贪污，混水摸鱼，造成了宁阳四多：（一）找活的雇工多。（光到泰安找活做的就有四千多）。（二）逃荒的多。（三）要饭的多。（四）汉奸多。黑暗混乱象人间地狱。县委根据这种情况，决定先把邪气压下去，再使运动深入。首先取消敌人的一套保甲制度，苛捐杂税，通过反奸诉苦，打垮了汉奸统治机构，紧接着转入减租运动。群众认识了我们的政策和主张后，自发的开展了反伪保长的斗争，当夜就有五六十人去找保长算账。邪气开始压下去，农民情绪高涨起来，领导上就抓紧了火候，趁热打铁，引导转入减租，对佃雇说明咱们是穷人的先锋队，要先翻身；对贫中农说明反奸胜利后咱们要帮助雇佃减租增资。首先组织了对“黄大人”的减租斗争，一直扩大到几十个村的联合斗争。“黄大人”曾坐过总督，有二百多顷大亩地（合市顷六百顷），用过男女仆人二百多个，有人比他的威风和红楼梦上的贾府差不多，他对佃户的剥削最厉害，他的租是活租，坏年景原租要，好年景就提高，如佃户不愿交，立即退地。到村里催租时，任意打骂侮辱佃户，小恒庄就是“黄大人”的庄，全庄都当佃户。这些佃户种了四辈子地了，越种越少，头一辈子时全村佃户还有五十多亩地，现在只落二十八亩了。年轻小伙子，只有两个娶媳妇的。这村男女老少的口头语：“再种一辈子地连根都种断了。”小恒庄倒租后，佃户分头出发联络外村，半月的工夫十多个村庄对黄大人的减租斗争胜利了！胜利后八百多雇佃联合开大会庆祝胜利，共倒粮食三十余万斤。目前各区正进行热烈的减租增资和回地斗争。
