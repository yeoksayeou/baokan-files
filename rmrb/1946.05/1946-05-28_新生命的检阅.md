　　Review of New Life
    Zeng Ke
    In May, the season when new life flourishes, the children of the Fourth District of Wuxiang held a grand competition of new heroism.
    The day after Labor Day, thousands of children, who had survived the severe suffering of war and famine, arrived at Yaozhuang early.
    The children were scattered on the river beach, on the hillside, in the meadow; the red and white, blue and white student caps on their heads glittered in the golden sunlight; their smiling red cheeks were more beautiful than flowers!
    With a loud whistle, the children, like a torrent, immediately gathered on the square on the east bank of the small river. The national flag and award flags fluttered in the clear sky. Countless slogan signs, with the power of encouragement, beckoned to the children under the flag shadows. Twenty or thirty young teachers, each with a kind smile on their faces, were busy organizing the children's formations and conducting songs. Lu Gaixiang, a female teacher from Wangzhuanggou Primary School, arranged resting and eating places for her students like a mother, her face covered in sweat, still stroking the children's heads and wiping their sweat! Wang Huan'an, a teacher from Xichuan Village Primary School, leaning on his high crutches, walked back and forth with great difficulty. With the same enthusiasm and sense of responsibility he had when he was a militiaman, he did not regret the leg he had lost in the war, dedicating his disabled life entirely to the work of cultivating revolutionary descendants.
    The meeting began. When the bright music stopped, the whole venue was silent, thousands of chattering little mouths were tightly closed. Thousands of pairs of dark and bright little eyes were focused on the stage. War had not only taught them to endure hardship and stand hard work, but had also given them the best training in discipline and organization. Thus, the chairman's loud speech was imprinted word by word in their keen little minds:
    "...If it wasn't for the victory of the War of Resistance, we couldn't have had such a grand meeting. If it wasn't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, our poor children would not have the right to education. In the past seven or eight years, too many children in our district have died. According to incomplete statistics, Chang'le, a small village on the Linpan Wu River beach, lost more than forty from starvation and murder." He raised his voice and said again:
    "We have not been intimidated by this cruel situation, we have become more determined and courageous. We have not forgotten to study in the mountain gullies and wilderness, even when we were hungry. A blackboard was hung on a tree branch, and we moved a few earthen clods on the ground to learn to read and listen to politics..."
    A roar of slogans, like thunder, echoed from below the stage. Thousands of little fists were waved powerfully:
    --Continue our fighting spirit! Avenge our dead brothers and sisters!
    The atmosphere of the meeting was constantly changing with the chairman's speech. When the chairman recounted the deeds of some heroic children who had sacrificed themselves, everyone's emotions changed from enthusiasm to solemnity. They lowered their little heads, some shedding tears. They were immersed in painful memories. Who could forget the disasters suffered in the past eight years, and who could forget the catastrophe brought by the enemy's occupation of Panlong for more than eight months! Which family had not lost relatives? Whose chickens, dogs, cattle, and sheep had not been driven to extinction? Now, their little hearts, full of bloodstains, were again occupied by that tragic scene. As soon as the chairman mentioned Baijiazhuang, only three miles away from Panlong, everyone immediately remembered the twelve-year-old fellow sufferer Li Aimin. His words in front of the enemy, as described by the villagers who had run back from the enemy, echoed clearly in everyone's ears:
    "Little kid, where are you from?" the enemy asked.
    A firm reply:
    "Chinese."
    "Tell us, where are the militiamen? Where are the cave dwellings where the people are fleeing? Take us to dig up grain!" The enemy pointed his gun at the children's chests, ordering them.
    The child stood calmly and said nothing.
    A puppet soldier came up and said enticingly:
    "Take the Imperial Army there! After that, we'll let you go back!"
    "Don't forget, you are also Chinese!" the child shouted loudly, glaring with angry eyes:
    The Japanese also shouted:
    "Little Eighth Routers! Die die die!"
    "You bastard, you're asking for death. I'm giving you a way out and you don't want it. Speak quickly, or I'll kill you." The puppet soldier cursed and kicked the child.
    "Chinese are not afraid to die! The people are all Eighth Route Army!"
    Before the last syllable of the child's roar was finished, the enemy's bayonet had pierced his left temple. He fell in a pool of blood with unyielding eyes.
    After recounting this passage, the chairman changed his mournful tone and finally encouraged everyone:
    "Now, the Japanese devils have been driven away by us. We must seize the time to learn various skills and strive for complete peace and build a new society!"
    With a burst of thunderous applause, the drills, singing, and recreational competitions began. Each village, regardless of the number of people, marched in such orderly steps. The children who shouted the commands were all full of energy and vigor, hoping to win the new heroism honor and reward, saluting the rostrum and looking at the viewers with smiles. Among the twenty or thirty kinds of recreational performances, the "dressing" drill of the Jing Primary School was the most novel and lively. The attention of the whole venue was focused on a dozen children who had taken off their coats, trousers, and socks. With an urgent whistle from the teacher, they calmly and quickly followed the order in which the clothes were arranged, competing to put them on neatly first. At this time, the audience applauded and discussed:
    "See how fast! The enemy has trained our children and adults to be capable these past few years! Children as young as four or five years old can do this so quickly when they hear there is a situation in the middle of the night!"
    The performance of the Chang'le Village singing about the sacrifice of the Forty-Eighth Martyrs was also a scene that won the praise of the whole venue. The women, with snow-white towels wrapped around their heads, used mournful tones to convey this unfortunate news to the people of the whole venue.
    After checking the cleanliness and hygiene, the teams went to visit the achievement exhibition hall in the temple west of the river. Three houses were filled. The walls were nailed with jujube thorns, displaying the best achievements in large and small characters, drawings, etc. Diaries, compositions, arithmetic assignments, and bright and neat covers emitted tempting light to those who came. The working children were recording and praising their working life! A child wrote in her diary about her mother: "My mother works hard all day long, pushing the millstone and grinding grain. At night, after I fall asleep, she still sits under the small oil lamp and sews clothes for me. The next morning, when I wake up, my mother is grinding grain again, and my new clothes are already made and placed by my pillow!" Their feelings are as real and simple as their lives. Every article praised the new life and the Eighth Route Army. Under the title of "Poor Peasants Overturn Their Lives," they expressed their love and gratitude to the Communist Party. They wrote letters to the soldiers at the front, examined their thoughts on serving the masses, and in their work and drawings, most of them were models of agricultural tools: small plows, small spinning wheels, clay cattle, mules, and also the Martyrs' Memorial Pavilion, pictures made of wheat straw, showing the beauty of folk art!
    After the evaluation by the evaluation committee and the children's representatives, Quebian Village and Daobian Village won the championship and runner-up in the total score, and all others were rewarded.
    The next day, the hero models selected by each school on Children's Day exchanged experiences. One loud voice after another spread across the venue. Production models, some introduced themselves, some introduced each other. They achieved self-sufficiency in coal carrying, shoe making, and making books and stationery. Hao Jiuyun from Panlong stood in front of the stage, gesticulating with his small hands, and said like a speech:
    "I raised two pigs for the school, and every day after class, I went to Panlong Street to pour out the sweet water. Now, I have a litter of chickens, and in the future, I will be able to raise four pigs, and I won't have to rely on my family for food and drink!"
    Everyone unanimously elected him as the district's production model.
    Zao Yan Wang Juze, this twelve or thirteen year old, very beautiful little girl, used her clear voice to introduce her experience in promoting health work:
    "I wash my face twice a day, change my clothes frequently, and also check on my classmates, and help neighboring women pay attention to hygiene!"
    Among the learning models, the learning spirit and achievements of Li Wenning, a mute from Mailuoshen Village, won the praise of the whole venue after being introduced by a primary school student on his behalf. He relied on physical cues every day and could recognize and write three characters.
    Wang Zhaolong from Bao Ruzhuang was selected as the district's health model because of his regular diet and lack of illness for four or five years.
    The competition for model little teachers was the most enthusiastic. Finally, Wang Yongan from Chang'le won the top prize for being the most capable of mastering his classmates and taking on the responsibility of a teacher.
    Hao Mengdong from Longtuan squeezed out his short, fat body from the crowd, and said with a smile:
    "The classmates chose me as the entertainment model. My ability is to make everyone happy, cheerful, and in good spirits. At school, I organize various games. When I am tired of reading and writing, I think of ways to cheer everyone up. When classmates skip school, I use game methods to motivate them to come to school and make them interested in school!"
    The whole venue applauded him.
    Transformation models were able to use the spirit of hating the past to talk about their past shortcomings of refusing to study and disrupting others' studies, and the process of correcting them.
    Thousands of children were educated, encouraged, improved, and determined to keep up with hope and models at this new type of meeting!
    In the golden sunset, in the magnificent music, in the constant applause, twenty or so award flags, shining medals and certificates, and bags of prizes were handed to the children...

　　新生命的检阅
    曾克
    在五月，这个新生命丰茂生长的季节，武乡四区的儿童们，举行了新英雄主义的大竞赛。
    劳动节的次一天，千百个从炮火和灾荒的严重苦难中活过来的孩子们，早早的都赶到姚庄来。
    孩子们散满在河滩上，山坡上，草地里，他们头上戴的红白，蓝白的学生帽，在金黄色的阳光中闪动，他们那笑着的红色脸颊，比花朵还美丽呵！
    一声响亮的哨音，孩子们如同激流，立刻集聚到小河东岸的广场上来了。国旗奖旗飘扬在晴空中。无数的标语牌牌，带着鼓舞勉励的力量，在旗影下向孩子们招唤，二三十个青年的教师们，个个脸上都闪着慈祥的微笑，忙忙碌碌的整理孩子们的队形，指挥唱歌。王庄沟小学女教员路改香，妈妈一般替自己的学生们，按置好了休息和吃饭的地点，脸上流着汗粒，还抚着小孩子的头，替孩子们揩汗呢！西川村小学教员王换安，拴着高脚拐杖，一只腿极吃力的前前后后走动着，他怀着和做民兵时同样的积极和责任心，毫不痛惜自己在战争中已经失去的一只腿，将残废了的生命，完全供献给培植革命后代的工作中。
    开会了。当明快的音乐停下来的时候，全场静寂了，千百张嘁嘁喳喳闹嚷的小嘴紧紧的闭拢了。千百双乌黑发亮的小眼睛，一致注视着台上。战争不但使他们学会了吃苦耐劳，还让他们获得了最好的纪律与组织的训练。这样，主席响亮的讲话，一字一句印在他们善于记忆的小脑子里去了：
    “……不是抗战胜利，咱们不可能开这样的大会。不是共产党八路军，咱们贫苦的孩子们那有受教育的权利，七八年来，咱们全区的儿童死难的太多了。据不完全的统计，光长乐这个临蟠武河滩大道的小村，连饿带杀，就损失了四十几个。”他提高了声音，又说：
    “我们并没有被这种惨酷的情形吓倒，我们是变得更坚决和勇敢了，我们在山沟野地里，饿着肚子，并没有忘记学习。一块黑板，挂在树枝上，几个土圪拉在地上划动，我们认了字，听了政治。……”
    台下激响起怒吼一般的口号声。千百只小拳头有力的挥动着：
    ——继续我们的战斗精神！为咱们死难的兄弟姊妹复仇！
    会场的空气，不断的跟着主席的讲话在变化，当主席述说到一些壮烈牺牲的儿童的事迹时，大家的情绪都从热烈转为严肃了。他们低垂着小脑袋，有的掉下眼泪来。他们沉入悲痛的回忆里。谁能够忘记八年来所遭受的灾难，谁更能够忘记敌人占据蟠龙这八个多月来的浩劫！谁家没有死去亲人？谁家的鸡犬牛羊没被赶绝？而今，他们这负满血痕的小心灵，又被那凄惨的画面占有了。主席刚一提到离蟠龙只有三里地的白家庄，人人立刻想起那个十二岁的小难友李爱民来，他在敌人面前所讲的话，犹如从敌人那里跑回来的村人叙述时一般，又清晰的响在大家的耳朵里了：
    “小孩子你是那里人？”敌人问。
    一声刚气的回答：
    “中国人。”
    “告诉我们，那里有民兵？老百姓逃难的窑洞在什么地方？带我们去刨粮食！”敌人用枪对准孩子们的胸膛，命令着。
    孩子沉着站立着一声也不响。
    一个伪军走上来，诱惑的说：
    “带着皇军们去吧！完了，放你回去！”
    “不要忘了，你也是一个中国人！”孩子瞪着愤怒的眼睛，大声的叫喊了：
    日本人也叫了：
    “小八路的！死拉死拉的有！”
    “王八羔子，你找死，老子给你活路你不要，快说，不说干掉你。”伪军叫骂着，踢了孩子一脚。
    “中国人就是不怕死！老百姓都是八路军！”
    孩子的吼声的尾音还没有结束，敌人的刺刀已经刺进他的左太阳穴里，他瞪着不屈的眼睛倒在血泊里。
    主席叙述了这一段经过以后，转变了他沉痛的声音，最后对大家鼓励着说：
    “现在，日本鬼子已被我们打走了，我们要抓紧时间，学习各种技术，为争取彻底和平，建设新社会努力！”
    随着一阵雷鸣的掌声，操演、唱歌和游艺的竞赛开始了。每个村，不论人多少，脚步都是那样的整齐，喊口令的孩子们，个个精神饱满旺健，怀着争取新英雄主义荣誉奖励的希望，向主席台行着注目礼，向观看的人们含笑的看着。在二三十种游艺表演中，却净小学校的“着装”演习，是最新鲜活泼。全场的注意力，集中在十几个脱下外衣、长裤和鞋袜的孩子们身上。一声紧急的哨音从老师的口中吹起，他们沉着而迅速的按着衣物排好的秩序，一件件的争着先穿整齐，这时，观众一面鼓掌，一面纷纷议论起来：
    “看有多快！敌人这几年把咱们娃娃大人都训练得有本事啦！四、五岁的娃娃，半夜三更一听说有情况，谁也能办到这样快！”
    长乐村演唱四八烈士牺牲，也是博得全场称赞的一幕，妇女们头上包着雪白的毛巾，用凄惋的音调，向全场的人们传布这个不幸的消息了。
    检查了清洁卫生，就分队去参观河西庙里的成绩陈列室。三所房子都摆满了。墙上用枣刺钉着大小字、图画等最优良的成绩，日记、作文、算术各种作业，鲜明整齐的封面，向走来的人，发着诱惑的光芒。劳动的孩子们在记述和歌颂他们的劳动生活啊！一个孩子，在日记上写她的妈妈说：“妈妈一天到晚劳累，推磨、碾碾，晚上，我睡下了，她还坐在小油灯下，替我缝衣裳，第二天早上，我醒来，妈妈又在推磨了，我的新衣已做好放在枕边了！”他们的感情像他们的生活一样真实而朴素。每一篇文章都在歌颂新生活和八路军，在一个《贫农翻身》的题目下，他们叫出了对共产党的热爱、感激，他们给前方战士写信，检讨为群众服务的思想，在他们的劳作和图画里，大部分是农具的模型：小犁、小纺车、泥做的牛儿、骡儿，还有烈士纪念亭，麦秸秆儿贴成的图画，显示出民间艺术的美！
    经过评委会，儿童代表共同的评判，却是编村和大编村荣获了总分数的冠军和亚军，其他完全受到了奖励。
    第二天，各学校在儿童节选出的英雄模范，进行经验交换。一个紧接着一个响亮的声音，在场子里散布开了。生产模范，有的自我介绍，有的互相介绍，他们用担煤、做鞋、做到书籍文具的自给。蟠龙郝九云站在台子前面，比着小手势，演讲一般的说：
    “我替学校养了两口猪，天天在下课时，到蟠龙街上去倒甘水，现在，又抱了一窝鸡儿，将来能养上四口猪，自己就可以不用家里贴吃渴了！”
    大家一致推选他为全区生产模范。
    枣烟王菊则，这个十二三岁，生得很美丽的小女孩儿，用清脆的嗓音，给大家介绍她推动卫生工作的经验：
    “我每天洗两次脸，勤换洗衣服，还检查小同学，并且帮助邻近妇女们讲究卫生！”
    在学习模范里，麦落神村的哑子李文宁的学习精神和成绩，经一个小学生代为介绍后，博得全场称赞，他每天靠实物暗示，能认会写会三个字。
    宝如庄王兆龙，由于饮食有规律，四五年不生病，被选为全区健康模范。
    模范小先生的竞赛最为热烈。最后，长乐王永安以最能掌握小同学，担当老师的责任，得了头奖。
    龙团郝孟冬，从人堆里钻出他的矮胖的身子，笑眯眯的说：
    “同学们选我为娱乐模范，我的本领是能让大家高兴、快乐、精神好，在学校里，组织各种玩耍，读书写字疲倦了，我想法子给大家神，小同学逃学，我用游戏方法动员他们到学校，让他们对学校发生兴趣！”
    全场给他鼓掌了。
    转变模范，都能用痛恨过去的精神，讲出他们过去不肯学习，破坏别人学习的缺点和改过过程。
    千百个儿童在这新型的会上受到教育，得到鼓励，提高进步，和希望与模范看齐的决心！
    在金色的晚霞中，在雄壮的音乐声里，在不停的掌声中，二十几面奖旗，一个个发光的奖章、奖状，一包包奖品，拿到孩子们的手中去……
    一九四六年五月五日
