　　Fengfeng Limin Coal Mine
    Launches May Great Production Movement
    Shuanghe Well Creates New Record of 1.06 Tons
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] To increase production and develop the border region's industry, the Fengfeng Limin Coal Mine has launched the May Great Production Movement with high labor enthusiasm. Workers' branches in each pit have voluntarily set their own production increase plans and labor discipline, launching production competitions. During the movement, output has increased daily, exceeding the original standards and catching up to pre-war levels. Tai'an Well originally aimed for 55% of the planned output per person, but within three days, it reached 78%. Before the movement, the average daily output per person at Shuanghe Well was 50% (half a ton). Starting from the 7th, the first branch of workers conducted a review, studied and reorganized the coal mining organization, strengthened the division of labor, and production efficiency increased daily. On the 12th, thirty-nine workers working in the kiln produced forty-one tons of coal, creating a highest record of average output of 1.06 tons. Shuanghe Well printed this amazing achievement into a special bulletin and distributed it to every miner, further inspiring the workers' labor enthusiasm. The total output of the entire mine increased from 750 tons in April to over 1,200 tons per month after this movement. To encourage production, Limin Company has prepared a bonus of 1.2 million yuan to reward labor heroes and model workers in the production movement.
