　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th】In six counties in western Zhejiang, including Hang County, Jiaxing, Chongde, Tongxiang, Wuxing, and Deqing, more than 30 townships and tens of thousands of farmers are spontaneously carrying out the liquidation of traitors. Since January of this year, the triggered people's revolts have reached as many as three times. According to a May 1st Shanghai Shih Pao (Shanghai Times) communication: Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, in eight months, the burden on farmers has been heavy, and the heads of villages and Bao are mostly puppet personnel, conscripting soldiers and extorting money, making people's lives unbearable. In the first four months, farmers successively petitioned in Hangzhou, in dozens of batches, each batch ranging from ten thousand to tens of thousands of people, totaling no less than hundreds of thousands, including men, women, old and young, but "the government pretended not to see," and the petitions were fruitless. In the past four months, farmers have stopped petitioning and spontaneously risen up to punish traitors and corrupt officials. The riots began on January 17 in more than 20 townships in Chongde, Tongxiang, Deqing, and Wuxing counties. "At the junction of the four counties, there was a sea of ​​fire, and the shouts shook the sky. Many heads of villages and Bao were kidnapped and beaten to death under public anger. Another township head, who had been detained by the district office, was also snatched out and executed by the masses, showing that the people had no confidence in the government's handling." This incident did not subside until January 21, but in less than two months, on March 13, farmers in six townships including Jiaxing's Xinsheng also rose up in revolt, lasting a week. Later, the county government sent military police to suppress the unrest, and reluctantly detained two puppet Bao chiefs before it was quelled. The most recent one occurred on April 8, when thousands of farmers in various villages near Linping Town in Hang County responded to the riot one after another. The next day, Ganyuan Township, adjacent to Tingzhi Township, followed suit. By the 11th, it had spread to nearby Xiaolin, Anmin, Xingting, Hemu, Dongxin, Lemei and other townships, with thousands of people participating in the riot. The Kuomintang authorities sent a town head who "usually had the people's support" to the villages to "appease" the situation. The farmers said, "We have suffered too much and can no longer bear it." The county government also sent a self-defense brigade to suppress the unrest. "When the troops arrived, the villagers were still rioting, and the villagers and the troops were playing hide-and-seek." Among those punished by the farmers this time were Feng, the Bao chief of Tingzhi Township, and six Bao chiefs of Xingting Township. Other township government employees in Anting, Tingzhi, Xiaolin, and Liuyuan townships, from township head to township clerks, were almost all severely beaten. A former county tax collector in Wuhang Township, who had been exploiting the people too much on weekdays, was thrown into the river and drowned in the anger of the masses. Regarding the causes of the popular uprising, the Shih Pao reporter quoted the Zhejiang provincial authorities' views on the previous riot in Chongde and other counties, saying that it was due to "the people's demand for the settlement of accounts, and the lack of transparency in the past collection of money, rice, firewood, food, and quilts by county, township, and Bao personnel, and the people's demand for the settlement of accounts." It also quoted a certain newspaper, believing that the people have suffered too much from the enemy and puppet's heavy taxes and extortion, and now the government still asks the people to collect and dispatch, arousing public outrage, and thus there is "the villagers' liquidation of township finances and grains, the so-called old debts and new debts are settled together." From this, the reporter stated: "The countryside needs peace and democracy. Only with these can it gradually embark on the road of construction and prosperity."

　　浙西勒索苛重民不聊生数万农民自动反奸清算
    桐乡德清等县一片烽火喊声震天
    【新华社延安二十七日电】浙西杭县、嘉兴、崇德、桐乡、吴兴、德清等六县三十余乡镇农民数万人，自动进行反奸清算。自本年一月迄今，被激起的民变已达三次之多。据五月一日上海时事新报通讯：自日寇投降以来，八个月中，农民负担苛重，而乡保长多系伪人员，抽丁勒索，民不聊生。农民最初四个月中，陆续到杭州请愿，先后计数十批，每批从万人至数万人，总计不下数十万人，男女老幼均有，但“政府装做看不见”，请愿毫无结果。今年四个月来，农民不再请愿，便自动起来惩办汉奸及贪官污吏，暴动从一月十七日崇德、桐乡、德清、吴兴四县二十几个乡镇开始，“四县接境处，一片烽火，喊声震天，乡保长多人被绑架而出，在众怒之下殴毙。另一乡长，已由区署拘押，也被民众劫出处死，表现出民众毫不信任政府的处置”。这次事变，直至一月二十一日始息，但不到两月，在三月十三日，嘉兴新胜等六处乡镇农民，亦起而暴动，历时计一周。后来县政府派军警去弹压，并不得已扣办了两个伪保长，始告平息。最近一次，是发生在四月八日，杭县临平镇附近各个乡数千农民，先后响应暴动。次日，与亭趾乡比邻的干元乡继起响应，十一日已波及附近的小林、安民、星亭、和睦、东新、乐梅等各乡，参加暴动的达数千人。国民党当局派了一个“素得民心”的镇长，下乡“抚慰”，农民们说：“我们太吃亏了，已忍受不下去了”。县政府并派了自卫大队来弹压，“部队开到，乡民仍然骚动，乡民和部队象捉迷藏一样的周旋着”。这次被农民们所惩办的，有亭趾乡保长冯某，星亭乡的六个保长，其他如安亭、亭趾、小林、六元各乡乡公所的职员，上至乡长，下至乡丁，几乎都遭到痛殴。五杭乡一个前任县税收员，因平日鱼肉乡民太甚，此次在群众激愤之下，被投入河中溺毙。民变发生的原因，时事新报记者征引浙省当局对上次崇德等县暴动事件的看法说：是由于“民众要求清算帐款，及各县乡保人员过去征收钱米、柴火、食物、棉被等用途不公开，民众要求清算”。又引述某报的话，认为民众受敌伪苛征暴敛已不胜负担之苦，今官厅仍问老百姓收派，激起公愤，遂有“乡民清算乡镇财粮之举，所谓旧欠新债一起清算是也。由此，该记者表示：“农村需要和平，需要民主，唯有了这，才能使它逐渐走上建设与繁荣的大道”。
