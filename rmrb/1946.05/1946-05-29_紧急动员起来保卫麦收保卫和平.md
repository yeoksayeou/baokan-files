　　Urgent Mobilization to Defend the Wheat Harvest and Defend Peace
    In recent days, we have continuously received news that the Kuomintang reactionaries are stepping up arrangements to seize wheat in various places. Taiyuan has even established a "Grain Procurement Committee," with "branch committees" or "sub-branch committees" established in the counties under its jurisdiction. At the "Security Conference" convened by the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters on the 17th, comprehensive arrangements were also made for the seizure of crops. These arrangements have already been put into action in Anyang, Yuci, Taigu, Xiuwu, and southern Shanxi. It is reported that on the 15th, when Yan's army advanced in three routes from Taiyuan and Yuci towards the wheat-producing areas of central Shanxi, our comrades Yang Zengfu, Deputy Political Commissar of the Yutai County Government, Wang Weize, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Zhan Rong, Director of the District Armed Forces Committee, and Zhang Yingzhong, District Chief, were sacrificed in the attack by the Kuomintang reactionaries' army. The Kuomintang army in Xiuwu also raided our district office, and our district political commissar and district chief were also brutally murdered. From these bloody lessons, we must realize that as our wheat is about to be harvested this year, the reactionaries will definitely come to rob the people's grain, and the reactionaries are doing everything possible to undermine our peace.
    Since the ceasefire order was issued on January 13, the Kuomintang reactionaries have continued to mobilize large armies and collect grain, constantly preparing to provoke civil war in our liberated areas, thus creating a severe grain shortage in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This point is even admitted by Xu Kan, the Kuomintang Minister of Food: "The reason for the grain shortage is mainly the excessive amount of military grain" (see the Nanjing dispatch of the 15th from the World Daily, published on the front page of this newspaper yesterday). In order to further prepare for a larger-scale civil war, the Kuomintang reactionaries not only unscrupulously extort the grain of the masses in their own controlled areas but also rob our wheat, attempting to starve us and use it as military grain for their civil war. The most reactionary and shameless Yan Xishan even put forward the slogan: "Rather let a village of old folks starve to death, than let one Jin-Sui soldier starve." The reactionaries are attempting to learn from the Japanese invaders' methods to seize the grain of our liberated areas.
    Peace was earned by the people's eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice, and wheat was grown by the people's year of sweat and toil! We must not allow the Kuomintang reactionaries to rob our wheat to use as rations for their civil war, as capital for undermining peace. We must clearly realize that defending this year's wheat harvest is one of the ways to defend peace and crush the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war plan. Therefore, we hope that the military and civilians throughout the region, especially those in the border areas, will immediately mobilize urgently, take effective measures quickly, thoroughly shatter the Kuomintang reactionaries' wheat-grabbing plan, and prevent a single grain of wheat from falling into the hands of the reactionaries!
    The serious struggle to defend grain is before us. In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we have gained rich experience in defending grain. All localities should make good use of past experience and combine it with the current situation to organize this struggle. The primary point is to strengthen the unified struggle of the Party, government, military, and civilians in the border areas, and to carry out a mass wheat-harvesting defense struggle in the form of labor and arms combination, in an organized and planned manner, leaving no gaps for the reactionaries to grab wheat. Any complacency or negligence will suffer undue losses!
    The specific form of leading the defense of the wheat harvest is to strengthen the command headquarters at all levels, organize militias, self-defense forces, guerrillas, and armed work teams to protect the masses' harvest, strengthen joint defense and vigilance, block news, and scout the situation of the stubborn and puppet forces. It is particularly important to approach the stubborn and puppet forces for reconnaissance, and report any wheat-grabbing situation of the stubborn and puppet forces at any time. In case of any unrest from the Kuomintang reactionaries, we should rise up to defend ourselves and resolutely strike them.
    In addition, the stubborn and puppet forces have recently used political deception to organize armed minorities into so-called "Refugee Return Teams" as tools and fuses to disrupt our wheat harvest. We should also have sufficient vigilance and preparation for this. For those coerced or deceived among them, we should use various methods to win them back so that they are not used by the reactionaries. However, for those traitors, bullies, and special agents who have fled to the Kuomintang-controlled areas and disguised themselves to sneak into our areas to cooperate with the reactionaries in seizing grain, we should resolutely suppress and strike them.

### 紧急动员起来保卫麦收保卫和平

　　紧急动员起来保卫麦收保卫和平
    最近几天，我们连续收到国民党反动派在各地加紧布置抢麦的消息。太原并已设立“筹粮委员会”，在其所辖各县分设“分会”或“支会”，十七日郑州绥署召开的“治安会议”上，对抢收亦作了全面的布置。这种布置，已于安阳、榆次、太谷、修武及晋南等地见诸行动，据十五日，阎军由太原、榆次分三路向晋中产麦区突进时，我榆太县政府，副政委杨增富，公安局长王维则，区武委会主任占荣，区长张应忠等同志在国民党反动派的军队进攻中牺牲了。修武国民党军亦曾奔袭我区署，我区政委，区长亦横遭惨杀。从这些血的教训中，我们必须认识到：我们今年的麦子将要丰收时，反动派一定要来抢劫人民的粮食，反动派正千方百计的破坏我们的和平。
    自一月十三日，停战命令颁布后，国民党反动派仍调动大军，筹集粮食，时时刻刻准备向我解放区挑动内战，因之造成了国民党统治区严重的粮荒。这一点，连国民党粮食部长徐堪也不得不承认：“粮荒原因，军粮太多为最大者”（见本报第一版昨天刊载十五日世界日报南京专电）国民党反动派为了进一步准备更大规模的内战，不仅不顾一切的将其自己统治区群众的粮食勒索尽，而且亦抢夺我们的麦子，企图困死我们，并以之作为其内战的军粮。最反动最无耻的阎锡山甚至提出：“宁饿死老百姓一村，不能饿互一个晋绥军”的口号，反动派企图想学日寇的一套来夺取我们解放区的粮食。
    和平是人民八年的流血牺牲换得的，麦子是人民一年的血汗辛劳耕种来的！我们决不能允许国民党反动派抢去我们的麦子，作为他们内战的口粮，作为破坏和平的资本，我们必须清楚的认识到：今年的保卫麦收，就是保卫和平、粉碎国民党反动派内战办法之一。因此，我们希望全区军民特别是边沿区军民，立即紧急动员起来，迅速采取有效的办法，给国民党反动派的抢麦计划以彻底的粉碎，不使一粒麦子落于反动派手里！
    保卫粮食的严重斗争是摆在我们面前了。在八年抗战中，我们对保卫粮食已取得丰富的经验，各地应很好的运用过去的经验，结合当前的情况，进行组织这一斗争。首要一点，就是强化边沿区党政军民一元化的斗争，以劳武结合的形式，有组织有计划的展开群众性的保卫麦收斗争，不给反动派的抢麦留下空隙，任何的麻痹疏忽，都将遭受不应有的损失！
    领导保卫麦收的具体形式，就是强化各级指挥部，组织民兵，自卫队，游击队以及武工队，保卫群众收割，加强联防警戒，封锁消息，侦察顽伪情，特别重要的要做到接近顽伪侦察，发现顽伪抢麦情况，随时报告，如遇国民党反动派的蠢动，应随时起而自卫，予以坚决打击。
    此外，顽伪近以政治欺骗组织武装少数所谓“难民还乡队”等，作为破坏我们麦收的工具和引线。对此，我们亦应有足够的警惕和准备，对其中胁从分子或受欺骗的群众，我们应用各种方法争取他们回头，使他们不为反动派所利用，但对那些逃亡在国民党统治区的汉奸，恶霸与特务，伪装潜入我区，配合反动派的抢粮，我们应坚决予以镇压和打击。
