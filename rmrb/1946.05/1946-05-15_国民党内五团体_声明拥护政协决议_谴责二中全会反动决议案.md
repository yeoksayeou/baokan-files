　　Kuomintang Internal Five Groups
    Declare Support for Political Consultative Conference Resolutions
    Condemn the Reactionary Resolutions of the Second Plenary Session
    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 11th Dispatch] Chongqing News: The Democratic Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Reform Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Hubei Provincial Party and Government Reform Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the New East Political Party Affairs Reform Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the Sanmin Zhuyi League Federation, five groups within the Kuomintang, recently issued a document entitled "Our Views on the Second Plenary Session of Our Party," declaring their opposition to the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and the reactionary conspiracy of the fascist faction, and expressing their support for the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). They believe that the true content of this meeting not only completely violates the teachings of justice and reason, the party's program, and the current will of the people, but also the propositions of the majority of comrades in the party who are truly loyal to the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, they solemnly declare that Kuomintang members who are truly loyal to the Three Principles of the People not only disagree with the feudal, stubborn, small-organization monopoly of political power and the attempt to control party affairs at this meeting, but also oppose it; these are definitely not the propositions of true Kuomintang members. The document vehemently denounces the true intention of the fascist faction within the Kuomintang in initiating the reform movement, which is to further achieve their control over party affairs and to overturn the various resolutions of the PCC, especially the agreement on the draft constitution, in order to achieve their goal of continuing to monopolize political power. At the same time, they believe that the reason why the Kuomintang has become a bureaucratic political group, with "the party separated from the people," "members becoming bureaucrats," "party headquarters becoming yamen," and "the party becoming incapable of solving the people's problems," is because feudal, stubborn, small organizations are corrupting the party. They also believe that the election of Standing Committee members of the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session and representatives to the National Assembly is a set of false democratic methods, the result of which is that members of feudal, stubborn, small organizations have all been elected. Therefore, they advocate for the implementation of true democracy within and outside the party, which must first eliminate feudal, stubborn, small organizations, "remove" the "bureaucratic party members" in these small organizations, and "remove" their "facts of controlling mass organizations at all levels and party affairs institutions at all levels, as well as monopolizing elections." The document solemnly expresses its support for the resolutions of the PCC, stating that the PCC agreement and the spirit of the party's program, the Five-Power Constitution, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings "do not have fundamental conflicts" and "meet the needs of the people," and denounces the feudal, stubborn, small organizations of the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session for their conspiracy to undermine the PCC resolutions and revise the constitutional agreement as base and shameless.

　　国民党内五团体
    声明拥护政协决议
    谴责二中全会反动决议案
    【新华社延安十一日电】渝讯：国民党党内中国国民党民主同志联谊会、中国国民党福建省党务改革委员会、中国国民党湖北省党政改革委员会、中国国民党新东政党务改革委员会、三民主义同盟联合会等五团体，日前发表“我们对于本党二中全会的表示”一文件，声明反对二中全会决议及法西斯派的反动阴谋，并表示拥护政协决议。他们认为这次会议的真正内容，不但和事理遗教、该党政纲以及当前人民意志完全违背，而且和该党大多数真正忠实于三民主义的同志的主张也是违背的。因此，他们郑重声明，真正忠实于三民主义的国民党员，不但不同意这次会议的封建的顽固小组织垄断政权、包办党务的企图，并且是反对它的，这些决不是真的国民党员的主张。该文件痛斥国民党内法西斯派发起革新运动的真正企图，是想进一步的达到他们的包办党务，并希望推翻政协会议各项决议，特别是对于宪草的协议，达到他们继续垄断政权的目的。他们同时认为国民党之所以成为官僚的政治集团，“党民隔离”，“党员官僚化”，“党部衙门化”，“党成为不能解决人民问题之党”，就是因为封建顽固的小组织在腐蚀该党。并认为国民党二中全会中常委及国大代表的选举，是一套假民主的手法，其结果，就是封建顽固的小组织分子都当选了。因此他们主张要实行党内外的真正民主，首先必须革除封建顽固的小组织。“革除”这些小组织里面的“官僚党员”，并“革除”其“把持各级民众团体各级党务机构的事实，以及包办选举的事实”。该文件郑重表示拥护政协决议称：政协协议和该党政纲五权宪法精神及总理遗教“并没有基本的冲突”，“符合人民的要求”，并指斥该党二中全会封建顽固的小组织阴谋破坏政协决议、修改宪法协议，是卑劣无耻的。
