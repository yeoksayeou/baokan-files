　　《New Masses》
    Circulation Increases to Over Eight Thousand Copies
    [News from this city] The popular mass publication "New Masses," compiled and printed by the North China Xinhua Bookstore, is the magazine with the most readers and the widest circulation in this region. This magazine was founded in June last year and has now reached its nineteenth issue. Initially a monthly publication, it was later changed to a bi-monthly publication at the request of readers. The current circulation of each issue has increased to 8,500 copies, and there is still a sense that it is insufficient. Its greatest characteristic is "readers are the authors" and "write about what you do." The people who write for the magazine include elementary school teachers, district and village cadres, rural theater troupe members, combatants, service personnel, traffic officers, barbers, etc. Currently, there are more than 500 regular contributing correspondents, and an average of 20 manuscripts are received every day. Many readers wrote to "New Masses" saying: "New Masses is very easy to understand, its content is practical, and it is of great help to me."

　　《新大众》
    发行增至八千余份
    【本市讯】华北新华书店编印的通俗大众刊物——《新大众》，是本区读者最多、销路最广的一个杂志。这杂志去年六月创刊，现在已出到十九期，起初是月刊，后应读者要求，改为半月刊。现在每期发行数量增至八千五百份，尚有不敷之感。其最大特点是“读者就是作者”、“做什么写什么”。给杂志写稿的人，有小学教员、区村干部、农村剧团团员、战斗员、勤务员、交通员、理发匠等。现在经常写稿的通讯员有五百多人，每天平均能收到二十件稿子。许多读者给《新大众》写信说：“新大众很好懂，内容又切合实际，对我的帮助很大。”
