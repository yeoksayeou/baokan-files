    Inside the Yamen on the Millet Street in Huai'an city stood a large stone tablet, erected in the fifth month of the seventh year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, one hundred and twenty years ago. The feudal landlords of Huai'an based their "strict punishment of wicked tenants, seizure of fields, and resistance to rent" on the words on this tablet. The tablet read: "Henceforth, should any unlawful tenants continue on their misguided path, once reported by the landlords, they will be immediately apprehended and severely punished according to the detailed regulations, and judged severely according to the law, without leniency. All you tenant farmers, do not test the law, lest you bring guilt and tears upon yourselves." The tablet also recorded the crimes of the tenants, such as "stubborn tenant," "crafty tenant," and "sly tenant." How many tenants were unjustly put to death under the guise of "testing the law," or forced to leave their homes and villages? How many tenants, not daring to "test the law," were sucked dry of their blood, fattening their "masters"? A farmer named Zhang pointed to the stone tablet and said: This is a thousand-jin gate pressing down on our heads.
            向秦老板算帐
    Tenant farmers in Shiqiao District, Huai'an, accounted for eighty percent of the district's population. The landlords were mostly large landowners from Huai'an city. After the New Fourth Army liberated Shiqiao District last autumn, a democratic government was established, and after the struggle against traitors, the masses plunged into a tide of reckoning. First, more than 160 tenant farmers from Jiaochang, Geli, Longdi, Eqian, and the four surrounding villages settled old accounts of illegal exploitation with the landlord Qin Shiliang. "Boss" Qin was the number one big landlord in Shiqiao District, owning six thousand mu of land and employing more than 160 tenant families. In addition to the regular rent, he demanded that tenants "borrow" wheat, three dou per mu each year, called "pre-borrowed wheat," but this "pre-borrowed" wheat was never returned. Paddy fields generally did not produce much in the spring, but tenants still had to send three sheng per mu to "Boss" Qin for making soy sauce, called "soy sauce brine." The "Boss'" family also employed many stewards and servants. The expenses of these people also came from the tenants, who had to pay three sheng of grain per mu per year, generally called "small rent." In the autumn, when the stewards went to the villages to inspect the rice harvest, the tenants had to give them money. For every shi of rice, five dou were added, called "viewing the rice fee." Each season, when the stewards went to the villages to collect rent, the tenants had to take turns preparing dishes and inviting them to eat, and the dishes had to be of the highest quality. The rent calculation was extremely harsh, including river boundaries and bank boundaries, which were all included in the rent payment, called "illusory fields and actual rent." If the head of the tenant's family died, and the land was inherited by his descendants, a paper had to be changed, and money had to be paid for the change, called "writing the field axis." When collecting rent, the "Boss'" peck measured one dou and two sheng when tenants measured one shi, this was Qin's custom, called "large peck and large dou." When the enemy was present, all the pseudo-fees borne by the "Boss" were forced to be paid by each tenant household. There were dozens of these fees, called "substituting pseudo-fees." Tenant Wang Dingsan, who farmed three mu of land, only had two mu and six fen. Last year, he harvested four shi, but three shi were taken away for rent. Plus the large peck measure, which took away six dou, and twelve reserve tickets were spent on "providing meals," resulting in only one dou left for himself to eat. This time, the tenant farmers of Shiqiao District sent representatives to the city to invite "Boss" Qin to the villages to settle accounts. The tenants near ten li settled accounts with him first, but it was fruitless due to Qin's arrogance and unreasonableness. The next day, a settlement conference of more than 300 tenant farmers from the four villages was convened. At the meeting, everyone spoke out about the words that were suppressed in their hearts one after another:
    "In the 26th year of the Republic of China, you increased the rent by two dou per mu, was that right or wrong?" "You used a twelve-dou peck measure to collect rent, was that right or wrong?" "You also made us dig ditches and build weirs without paying us, was that right or wrong?!...,...,... " The tenants continuously raised questions, demanding settlement. Each time a question was raised, the crowd would shout like thunder, "Not right!" "Yes!" Old grandmothers who had never dared to speak in public also squeezed forward in the crowd and said tremblingly, "For one meal, I spent five dou of rice. When my family provided meals, the stewards complained that the chickens and ducks were too small and wanted to overturn the table." Everyone shouted in unison, "Take out the exploited grain!" Tenant Zhou Hu, not to mention the regular rent, had been illegally exploited of twenty-six shi and six dou of grain over the years. The tenants demanded that "Boss" Qin take out the illegally exploited grain within a limited time. One tenant shouted in the crowd: "They eat pork and white rice, we eat thin soup, we can't stand being hungry! He must take out six hundred shi of grain within three days." Under the legitimate reasons and strong pressure from the tenants, "Boss" Qin finally lowered his head and admitted to returning the illegally exploited grain to the tenants. He first paid part of the grain, and if it was not enough, he was willing to convert it into rice land. Since there were many tenants, there was no time to calculate in detail, so a settlement committee was established on the spot to conduct detailed calculations.
            掀掉镇压佃户的石碑
    After the tenants of Shiqiao District held this conference, everyone wanted to discuss how to go to the city to ask the landlords to settle accounts. One early morning, more than four thousand tenants gathered in the Dragon King Pavilion. In order to unify their actions, command posts were established in each village, and a general command post, a propaganda team, and a communications group were also established. The district farmers' association was guiding the masses, and more than ten mu of open space were filled. A "getting hands on" (得手) team was also organized to report news from the city to the outside. This sound spread from one corner to another, and everyone was stirred up! The hearts of more than four thousand people were surging, eager to rush into the city. Around ten o'clock, the team entered the city from the South Gate, mighty and like a dragon. At the front were two huge banners of "Shiqiao District Farmers' Association" and "Inviting Landlords to Return to the Villages to Settle Accounts," followed by two large flags, "Opposing Unreasonable Exploitation" and "Thoroughly Reducing Rent and Interest." After entering the city, the tenants dispersed and went to the landlords' homes to invite the "Bosses" out. Immediately, deafening gongs and drums sounded in the city, and several flags flew in the air. Red and green slogans also appeared on the walls of the streets. The propaganda team explained the significance of inviting the landlords to the villages to reduce rent to the audience on the streets. Landlords' residences were surrounded by crowds in dozens of places. Each village also established "reception centers" in the city, specifically for the landlords who were invited to the villages to rest. The landlords were invited to the reception centers one after another, and the sound of gongs and drums rang again. Under the big flags, the famous big landlords of the city were invited to rest in the reception centers, surrounded by dozens of people.
    The command post asked the tenants to gather at the stadium immediately. In less than an hour, more than two thousand tenants had gathered. One tenant stood on a high pile and said passionately: "We must sweep away the stone tablet in the county Yamen. This is the landlords' magic weapon, which suppresses the farmers in the southeast villages, and does not allow the tenants to turn over." "Yes!" "Yes!" "Go! Go! Go!" The tenants below shouted in unison, and more than two thousand tenants stirred up! Like a mountain of people and a sea of people pressing down, young people were running, and old people and women were also walking quickly, rushing to the gate of the county Yamen. Some were looking for ropes, some were looking for stone hammers, and some were grabbing the top of the tablet and chanting "stubborn tenant," "crafty tenant," and "wicked tenant." The crowd was filled with anger. One tenant pointed to the stone tablet and said: "You have been pressing down on our heads for more than a hundred years!" When the angry farmers pulled the rope tied to the stone tablet, the "stone tablet" built by the feudal landlords of Huai'an to suppress the tenants, which was meant to be "eternal and long-lasting" and weighed a thousand jin, collapsed with a bang! Applause was like thunder, and the deafening gongs and drums sounded loudly again. The big stone pressing on their hearts was destroyed, and the oppressed turned over. The roar of triumph and the unbridled laughter lasted for a long time. An old man surnamed Zhang among the tenants was almost moved to tears and said: "The thousand-jin gate on our heads is destroyed!" More than four thousand tenants were victorious! The huge procession, beating the gongs and drums of victory, pulled the landlords to the villages. After arriving in the villages, the tenants of each village organized rent settlement delegations or groups to conduct settlement separately. During the settlement, the tenants were very generous and still conducted the settlement in a reasonable manner. The tenants were very generous. In more than twenty cases of excess exploitation, only three to five or one to two types were selected to settle with the "Boss," but the number was still very large, which showed how terribly the landlords had exploited the tenants in the past. After the landlords admitted their mistakes, the tenants made significant concessions.

    ——淮安石塘区佃户翻身记
            顶在头上的千斤闸
    淮安城里臼街衙门里面有一个大石碑，是在前清道光七年五月立的，迄今有一百二十年。淮城的封建地主就是照碑上的话来“严惩恶佃霸田抗租”，碑上写着：“嗣后倘有不法佃户仍蹈前辙，一经业户呈控，定即严拿，依照详定规条从严惩办，按律治罪，决不宽贷，尔等佃农，慎勿以身试法，致干罪泪。”碑上并记载着佃户的罪状，“顽佃”“刁佃”“狡佃”等。多少佃户在“以身试法”下，被无辜处死，或被迫离乡背井，多少佃户不敢“以身试法”而被吸尽了血，养肥了“主人”。一个姓帐的农民指着石碑说：这是顶在我们头上的千斤闸。
            向秦老板算帐
    淮安石塘区佃户占了该区人口的百分之八十，业主多是淮城的大地主。新四军去秋解放了石塘区以后，民主政权建立了，群众在反奸斗争之后，卷入了清算的热潮，首先是教场、各里、龙堤、鹅钱、四乡，一百六十多家佃户，和地主秦士良清算过去违法剥削的旧帐。秦“老板”是石塘区的头号大地主，有田六千亩，佃户有一百六十多家，除正租外，他要向佃户“借”麦，每年每亩三斗，叫做“预借麦”但这个“预借”从来不曾还过。水田一般春季出产东西不多，但要照例每亩送三升给秦“老板”做酱，叫做“酱卤”。“老板”家还用了许多管事先生和仆人。这些人的开支也要出在佃户身上，每亩田每年要纳粮三升，通叫做“小租”。秋天管事先生下乡看稻收成，佃户要送钱给他。每石稻要出五斗“倍头”，这叫做“看稻费”，每季管事先生下乡收租，佃户们要轮流办莱请他们吃饭，菜一定要上等的。收租计算十分苛刻，连河界岸界都算在内，照数纳租这叫做“虚田实租”。如果佃户的家长死了，由子孙继承，要换纸，换纸还要出钱，这叫做“写田轴”。收租时老板的斛子，要量佃户的一石二斗才合到他家一石，此为秦家惯例，叫“大斛大斗”。敌人在时，一切老板负担的伪费，逼着每家佃户代出。这些费有几十种，这叫做“代出伪费”。佃户王鼎三，种三亩地，只有二亩六分，去年收四石，交租就去掉三石；加上大斛一量，去掉六斗，又被“供饭”花去十二张储备票，结果只剩一斗自己吃了。这一次，石塘区佃户们派代表到城内请秦老板下乡，十里附近的佃户先和他清算，由于秦的蛮横无理没有结果。次日乃召开了四乡三百余人的佃户算帐大会，在会上大家一个接一个吐出压在心里的话：
    “民国二十六年，你每亩加二斗，错不错呀？”“你用十二斗一石的大斛收租，错不错呀？”“你又叫我们挑沟挖圩，不拿钱，错不错？！……，……，……。”佃户们连续不断的提出质问，要求清算，每当提出一项质问时，人群中即发出“不错呀！”“对呀！”雷一样的高呼，从来不敢在人前说话的老奶奶，也在人堆里向前直挤，颤巍巍的说：“为供一次饭，我花五斗米，我家供饭，管事的还嫌鸡鸭小，要掀桌子。”大家异口同声的发出巨大的怒吼，“把剥削的粮食拿出来！”佃户周虎除正租不谈，几年来，额外剥削的粮食就有二十六石六斗：佃户，要求秦老板限日期拿出额外剥削的粮食，一个佃户在人群中高叫：“他们吃的猪肉白米饭，我们吃的稀汤，经不起饿呀！他三天内拿出六百石粮来。”在佃户的正当理由与强大压力下，秦老板终于低下了头，承认将过去非法剥削退回给佃户。先付出部分粮食，不够并自愿以稻地折算。由于佃户多，来不及一一细算，当场成立下算帐委员会，进行算细帐。
            掀掉镇压佃户的石碑
    石塘区佃户开了这个大会后，大家要讨论怎么进城请地主算帐，一天清早四千多佃户在龙王阁会齐后，为使行动统一，各乡分别设立指挥部，又成立了总指挥部，宣传队、通讯组等，区农会在指导着群众，十余亩的广田都被站满了，还组织了专门从城内到城外报告消息的“得手”，这声音从这一角传到那一角，大伙儿听了全部骚动起来了！四千余人心在动荡，急急要冲进城去，十时左右，队伍从南门进城，浩浩荡荡如同一条龙，前面是两幅“石塘区农民联合会”，“请地主回乡算帐”的巨大横额，紧接着两面大旗，是“反对无理剥削”，“彻底减租减息”。进城后，佃户们即行分散，分别至业主家请出老板，立刻城内响起了震天的锣鼓声，几幅大旗在空中飞舞着，红绿色的标语，也在大街墙壁上出现了。宣传队在街头上向观众们解释着请地主下乡减租的意义，有几十处地主的住宅，人群围着。各乡并在城内设立了“招待所”，专为被请下乡地主休息的，地主们接连不断的被请到招待所，锣鼓声又响起来了。大旗下边，全城著名大地主在几十个群众的簇拥下，亦被请到招待所去休息了。
    指挥部请佃户立即到体育场集合，不到一小时，已集结佃户二千余人，一个佃户站在高堆上激昂的说：“县衙门那块石碑我们要去扫掀掉，这是地主的法宝，是镇压东南乡种田人的，叫佃户不得翻身。”“对！”“对！”“去！去！去！”下面的佃户，齐声的喊，二千余佃户哄动起来了！象人山人海倒压下去，年青人在奔跑，年老人、妇女也快步走着，拥到了县衙门口。有的在找绳子，有的找石锤子，有的抓住碑的顶上在念着什么“顽佃”“狡佃”“恶佃”，群众怒气冲天，一个佃户指着石碑说：“你压在我们头上一百多年了！”当愤怒的农民将套在石碑上的绳子一拉，淮城封建地主为镇压佃户而建立的满想“永垂久远”、千斤重的“石碑”轰然倒下来了！鼓掌好似雷鸣，喧天的锣鼓又大声的响起来了。压在心头的大石头毁了，被压迫者翻身了，狂呼声纵情的欢笑声，历久不绝。佃户中一个姓张的老头子几乎感动得流出泪来说：“在头上的千斤闸可毁啦！”四千余佃户胜利了！巨大的行列，敲着胜利的锣鼓，拉着地主下乡去了。到乡后，各乡佃户，即分别组织算租账代表团或小组进行结算。在算账时，还是以讲理方式进行，佃户表现得很宽大。在二十多宗超额剥削中，只选出三五种至一二种与老板结算，但其数仍甚巨大，可见地主过去对佃户剥削之惨重。佃户们在地主认错后，又作了重大的让步。
