　　Guomindang Troops Stir Up Trouble East of the Pinghan Railway
    Attempting to Attack the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    The People of the Entire Region Are Outraged and Demand Resolute Resistance
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 21st Dispatch] After Guomindang troops occupied the cities of Xiayi in our Eastern Henan Liberated Area and Xiaoxian in Northern Jiangsu (both south of the Longhai Railway), they actively advanced northwards. On the south side of the railway, they are attacking the heartland region between Taikang, Qi County, and Sui County, where they rape, loot, and kill the people wherever they go. In the villages of Changgong and Wagang, southwest of Sui County, over twenty people were killed. From the 8th to the 15th, the Yan (jin) Qi (county) Ji (county) Security Brigade and puppet troops of Li Ying, Wang Sanzhu, and others on the east side of the Pinghan Railway successively occupied over ten strategic points in our Hua County, including the Niushitun livestock market and its surrounding areas. The Guomindang troops and puppet troops stationed in Changyuan and Laocheng have prepared a week's worth of dry rations and shoes, and have gathered a large number of civilian laborers. It is reliably learned that these troops will mobilize within one to two days to occupy the Liberated Area between Changyuan and Hua County in northeastern Henan, and will further occupy the entire southern border of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region north of the Longhai Railway, in coordination with their "suppression" forces in eastern Henan to eliminate our Eastern Henan Liberated Area. Recently, the puppet troops of Du Shu in Dongming have been unusually arrogant, claiming that they will "cooperate with the old Central Army to eliminate the bandit area." The comprehensive offensive of the Guomindang troops and puppet troops against our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region is about to begin. Currently, the people of the entire border region are outraged and unanimously demand that our army resolutely strike against the aggressive flames of the Guomindang reactionaries.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 21st Dispatch] On the 15th, Guomindang troops and puppet troops on the east side of the Pinghan Railway invaded six villages and towns in the Northern Henan Liberated Area. On the 15th, a battalion of the 68th Army of the Guomindang in Yanjin, in coordination with the 2nd Security Regiment of the Guomindang stationed in Yuanwu, Yangwu, and Yanjin, invaded Weiqiuji, 20 li northeast of Yanjin. On the same day, puppet troops under Wang Delin invaded Niushitun, northwest of Changyuan, and puppet troops under Liu Mingde invaded Longmiao, over 20 li southwest of Niushitun. The Yan (jin) Qi (county) Ji (county) Security Brigade under Liu Fengchao also invaded Wangbao Village, 15 li west of Niushitun, on the same day. Puppet troops under Wang Yuzhu occupied Niuguangxiang Temple, 20 li southeast of Niushitun. The local Guomindang troops in Changyuan under He Guansan, numbering over 3,000, are currently rushing to build fortifications in the above-mentioned occupied areas, carrying over a hundred civilian laborers, preparing to invade again.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nangong, 20th Dispatch] The puppet troops under renegade Yuan Yanchou, renegade Han Maozai, renegade Pang Changshen, and renegade Yang Jingzhai, entrenched around Changqing and Qihe, have launched 146 attacks against the Liberated Area since the ceasefire order, using a force of 27,570 men, killing over 70 village cadres and civilians in our area, capturing 127 people, and devastating over 240 villages.
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 21st Dispatch] The Eastern Henan Group of the Xinxiang Central Executive Group, which has been repeatedly obstructed by Zhao Zili, Chief of Staff of the Guomindang Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, and Liu Ruming, Director of the Kaifeng Sixth Pacification Area, traveled between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng from the 11th to the 18th. On the 18th, the Guomindang representative suddenly told the American and Communist representatives of the Eastern Henan Group that "if you insist on going to eastern Henan for investigation, the Guomindang army cannot guarantee the safety of the group." After being threatened, the group was forced to return to Xinxiang on the 19th. This shows the determination of the Guomindang army to expand the civil war and attack our Eastern Henan Liberated Area.

　　平汉路东国民党军蠢动
    妄图进攻冀鲁豫区
    全区人民愤慨万状要求坚决抗击
    【本报邯郸二十一日讯】国民党军进占我豫东解放区的夏邑与苏北之萧县两城后（均在陇海路南），即积极向北挺进，路南方面，正进攻我太康、杞县、睢县间腹心地区，所到之处，奸淫掳掠，残杀人民，在睢县西南之长岗、瓦岗两村即被杀二十余人。平汉东侧延（津）淇（县）汲（县）保安旅与伪军李英、王三珠等部自八日起至十五日，先后占我滑县之牛市屯及其四周各战略要点等十余处，驻长垣、老城之国民党军与伪军已准备好一周干粮、鞋子，并集中大量民夫，据确悉：该军将于一二日内出动攻占我东北长垣滑县间的解放区，并进而将陇海路北我冀鲁豫区南境全部占领，以配合其豫东“进剿”之部队肃清我豫东解放区。近日东明伪军杜淑部异常嚣张，扬言“配合老中央军清剿匪区”。国民党军与伪军对我冀鲁豫区的全面进攻即将开始，现全边区人民愤慨万状，一致要求我军坚决打击国民党反动派进攻凶焰。
    【新华社邯郸二十一日电】平汉路东侧国民党军及伪军，十五日侵占豫北解放区村镇六处。十五日，延津国民党六十八军一个营，配合驻原武、阳武、延津之国民党保安二团，侵占延津东北二十里之魏邱集。同日，伪军王德林部侵占长垣西北之牛市屯，伪军刘明德部侵占牛市屯西南二十余里之龙庙。延（津）淇（县）汲（县）保安旅刘凤朝部，亦于是日进犯牛市屯西十五里之王堡村，伪军王玉珠部占我牛市屯东南二十里之牛馆相寺。国民党长垣地方部队何冠三部三千余人，携带民夫百余人，刻正在以上侵占地区赶修工事，准备再犯。
    【新华社南宫二十日电】盘踞长清齐河一带之伪军袁逆砚秋、韩逆茂才、庞逆长申、杨逆静斋等部，停战令后向解放区进犯共一百四十六次，使用兵力两万七千五百七十人，打死我区村干部及群众等七十余名，捕走一百廿七人，残害村庄二百四十余。
    【本报邯郸二十一日讯】被国民党郑州绥靖公署参谋长赵子立与开封第六绥靖区主任刘汝明百般阻难的新乡中心执行小组之豫东小组，自十一日到十八日往返于郑州开封间。国方代表奉命突于十八日向豫东小组之美方与中共代表表示：“若一定赴豫东勘察，国军不能保障小组安全”。该组受此威胁后，被迫已于十九日返回新乡。于此，可见国民党军企图扩大内战，向我豫东解放区进攻之决心。
