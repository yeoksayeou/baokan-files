　　The Flames of Liberation Ignite Across Both Sides of the Pinghan Railway
    Over 200,000 People Involved in Rent Reduction Movement
    Black Gun Attacks Suppressed in Northern Henan, Pushing Mass Movement to Climax
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai] The rent reduction movement in the new areas of counties under the First Special District of Taihang has been universally launched. The flames of liberation have ignited across both sides of the Pinghan Railway. According to statistics from nine counties including Xingtai, Zanhuang, Shahe, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Gaoyi, Yuanshi, Huolu, and Jingxing: among the forty districts and eight hundred and eighty-six administrative villages, one hundred and twenty-four villages have moved from rent reduction and debt clearing to production; the movement is deepening in two hundred and forty-eight villages; three hundred and thirty-four villages have entered the high tide of rent reduction; and only ninety-three villages are still in the mobilization stage. Furthermore, according to statistics from twenty-nine districts in nine counties, 216,499 people have participated in the struggle for liberation, accounting for half of the local population. A total of 34,945 tenancy and other issues have been resolved. Landlords have legally returned a total of 14,696 mu of land, 5,150 shi of grain, 4,827 rooms, and 3,733,363 yuan in local currency to the masses. In order to fully mobilize the masses before the summer harvest, the district has put forward the following key points: (1) The mass movement must be combined with production, grasping the characteristics of the production season, and preventing the mechanical application of methods from the slack farming season to the busy farming season. (2) Better implement the leadership method of boldness and allowing a free hand, overcoming the style of paternalism and substitution, and especially breaking the "stage theory" of some cadres, who believe that after the anti-traitor and rent reduction are completed, they can concentrate on production. (3) Strengthen the unity among farmers, organize mutual assistance in production, and be vigilant against the landlord's counterattacks at all times. The movement in the entire district is developing rapidly and smoothly.
    [Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo] The rent reduction movement in the counties of northern Henan under the Fourth Special District of Taihang is currently reaching its climax. Bo'ai and Wenxian counties have already transitioned from popularization to deepening. According to incomplete statistics, in Wenxian, one hundred and five villages have already reduced rent or are in the process of reducing rent. In Bo'ai, ninety-six villages have. In Hui (county) North, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi, it is being widely carried out. In Hui (county) North, eighty-three villages and in Xiuwu two-thirds of the villages are in the process of rent reduction and investigation, while Qinyang is transitioning to rent reduction. The development of the mass movement in northern Henan has been slightly slower than in other areas of Taihang, mainly because the Kuomintang and the puppet troops they utilized frequently attacked the liberated areas, and national special agents and bandits carried out cruel black gun attacks on the local peasants, causing the masses' liberation movement to suffer more difficulties, but also further honing the experience of combining the masses' liberation with armed struggle. This successful experience proves that black guns can only be suppressed when the masses organize strong militia to defend their own liberation. In the border areas, the anti-traitor and rent reduction movement was only launched when the militia carried out a powerful self-defense against the attacking stubborn puppet troops. The recent rapid development of the movement is mainly due to the implementation of the principle of boldness, allowing a free hand, and supporting the masses from above. On the cadre side, the counties have successively resolved the ideological problem of underestimating tenancy issues and liquidated the style of substitution and paternalism. The counties are now striving to universally implement the rent reduction movement before the wheat harvest.

　　群众翻身烈火燃遍平汉两侧
    廿余万人卷入减租运动 
    豫北镇压了黑枪袭扰群运达高潮
    【本报邢台讯】太行一专区所属各县，新区减租运动已获普遍开展，群众翻身的烈火，已燃遍平汉两侧。据邢台、赞皇、沙河、内邱、临城、高邑、元氏、获鹿、井陉等九个县统计：四十个区，八百八十六个行政村中，一百二十四个村已由减租清债转上生产；二百四十八个村运动正转向深入，三百三十四个村已走上减租高潮；仅九十三个村正在发动。另据九个县二十九个区统计，参加翻身斗争者达二十一万六千四百九十九人，占当地人口的一半，共解决租佃等问题三万四千九百四十五件，地主依法退还群众的东西共计土地一万四千六百九十六亩，粮食五千一百五十石，房屋四千八百二十七间，本币三百七十三万三千三百六十三元。为了达到夏收前把群众充分发动起来，现该区特提出以下努力的几点：（一）群运要与生产相结合，掌握生产季节的特点，防止把农闲时期的办法，机械的搬用到农忙季节。（二）更好的实现大胆放手的领导方法，克服包办代替作风，特别要打破某些干部的“阶段论”，认为反奸和减租完了，再好好生产。（三）加强农民间的团结，组织生产互助，随时注意地主的反攻。现全区运动，正迅速顺利地向前发展
    【本报焦作讯】太行四专区豫北各县的减租运动，目前正走上高潮。博爱、温县两县，且已由普及走向深入。据不完全统计，已经减租与正进行减租的村庄，温县已达一百零五村，博爱已达九十六村，辉（县）北与修武、武陟，则正普遍开展。辉（县）北八十三村，修武三分之二的村庄，正进行减租与查减，沁阳则正转上减租。豫北群运的发展，较太行其他地区稍迟，主要原因由于国民党及其所利用的伪军，经常向解放区进攻，利用国特、土匪，对当地农民残酷的黑枪袭扰，使群众的翻身运动遭受了更多的困难，然而也更锻炼了群众翻身与武装斗争结合的经验。这一胜利的经验证明只有群众为保卫自己翻身组织起坚强的民兵时，黑枪才能被镇压下去。在边沿区，是在民兵对进攻的顽伪军进行有力自卫时，才开展了反奸减租运动。运动最近获得迅速发展，在领导上的主要原因：则是贯彻了大胆放手，与自上而下的撑腰作主方针的结果。在干部方面各县相继解决了轻视租佃问题的思想，与清算了代替包办的作风。现各县正争取减租运动，在麦收前普遍贯彻。
