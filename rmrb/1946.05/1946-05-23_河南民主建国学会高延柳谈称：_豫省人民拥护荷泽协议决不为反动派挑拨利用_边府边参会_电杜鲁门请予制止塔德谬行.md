    [Xinhua News Agency Yangcheng Dispatch] The Kuomintang reactionaries, in violation of the Heze River Management Agreement, are plotting to release water to flood our Jiluyu Liberated Area, and are using this to provoke the relationship between the people of Jilu provinces and Henan province. To this end, this reporter specifically visited Mr. Gao Yanliu, the person in charge of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association, who gave the following statement. Mr. Gao first pointed out: "In the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938], the Kuomintang army was corrupt and incompetent, attempting to use the Yellow River water to stop the enemy, using the lives and property of the people of Henan as a bet, causing the submergence of sixteen counties in Henan and Anhui provinces, resulting in the deaths of more than 300,000 people and the loss of homes for six million people, but in the end, they did not stop the enemy. The people of Henan will never forget the disaster caused by this kind of昏聩(hun kui - muddle-headed) actions of the Kuomintang." Mr. Gao continued: "The Kuomintang authorities usually do not care about the new flooded areas of Henan, which is enough to prove that their eagerness to close the breach and return the river to its original course is not mainly to benefit the people of Henan and eliminate harm, but to cooperate with their conspiracy to launch a civil war. Therefore, from the standpoint of the people of Henan, we fully support the Heze Agreement, to restore the dikes first and then close the breach, and at the same time, the new embankments in Henan should be properly built to prevent the expansion of the new flooded area, and the victims in the new flooded area should be actively relieved." Speaking of the Kuomintang's malicious provocations, he said that provoking dissension, creating hatred between the people, and dividing the unity of the people are the tricks that the Kuomintang reactionaries always use, but the eyes of the people of Henan are bright, and they will certainly not be exploited by the reactionaries. Today, the correct policy of the people of Henan is: to closely unite with the people of Jilu provinces, to oppose the reactionaries' conspiracy for civil war, to achieve a long-term and stable river management method, so that the people of the three provinces will never suffer from the Yellow River disaster again. Our Henan Democratic National Construction Association is willing to make every effort to fight for this goal."
    [Xinhua News Agency Handan, 19th Dispatch] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Area Council and the Border Area Government, concerning Mr. Tarde, an American technical advisor from UNRRA, assisting the Kuomintang reactionaries in destroying the Heze River Management Agreement and endangering the lives and property of seven million people along the river, have telegraphed President Truman and the American people, requesting them to persuade Mr. Tarde to stop this behavior. The telegram stated: Mr. Tarde, a technical advisor from your country sent by UNRRA, is actively supervising and inspecting the work of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and has decided to close the breach and release the water by the end of May. He completely ignores the Heze Agreement jointly decided by the River Management Committee and the Liberated Area to dredge the river and restore the dikes before closing the breach and releasing the water, and has not started to repair the dikes downstream, and the滔天大祸(tao tian da huo- tremendous disaster) of hundreds of millions of people is imminent. Therefore, we request your President and the American people to uphold justice and tell Mr. Tarde not to help the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war conspiracy and cause an unprecedented catastrophe in China.

　　河南民主建国学会高延柳谈称：
    豫省人民拥护荷泽协议决不为反动派挑拨利用
    边府边参会
    电杜鲁门请予制止塔德谬行
    【新华社阳城讯】国民党反动派违背荷泽治河协议，阴谋放水淹我冀鲁豫解放区，并借此挑拨冀鲁两省及豫省人民关系。为此记者特走访河南民主建国学会负责人高延柳老先生，承发表谈话如下。高先生首先指出：“民国二十七年，国民党军腐败无能，企图以黄水阻止敌人，以河南人民生命财产作赌注，使豫皖两省十六县陆沉，三十多万人死于非命，六百万人失去家园，而结果并未阻住敌人。我河南人民对于国民党此种昏聩的作法，所造成的灾难，永不能忘。”高先生继称：“平时国民党当局对于河南新泛区漠不关心，这足以证明他们此次急于堵口归故，主要目的并不在于为河南人民兴利除害，而在于配合其发动内战的阴谋。因此，站在河南人民的立场上，我们完全拥护荷泽协议，先行复堤而后堵口，同时对河南新堤岸要妥为修筑，防止新泛区扩大，对新泛区灾胞要积极救济。”谈到国民党的恶意挑拨时，他说挑拨离间，制造人民之间的仇恨，分裂人民之团结，是国民党反动派贯使的伎俩，但是，河南人民的眼睛是明亮的，必不会受反动派的利用。今天河南人民的正确方针是：和冀鲁两省人民密切的团结起来，反对反动派的内战阴谋，实现长治久安的治河办法，使三省人民永不再罹黄灾。我们河南民主建国学会，愿以一切努力，为这一目标而奋斗。”
    【新华社邯郸十九日电】晋冀鲁豫边区参议会暨边区政府，顷为联总美籍技术顾问塔德先生帮助国民党反动派，破坏荷泽治河协议，危害沿河七百万人民生命财产安全，特致电杜鲁门总统暨全美人民，请予劝止塔氏此种行为，电称：联总所派贵国技术顾问塔德先生，协助国民党反动派积极监工督修，决定五月底堵口放水，对先浚河复堤而后堵口放水之治河委员会与解放区共同决定的荷泽协议，竟置之不理，对下游修堤毫未着手，数百万人之滔天大祸，即在目前。因此请求贵总统及全美人民，主持正义，转告塔德先生，不要帮助国民党反动派之内战阴谋，造成中国之空前浩劫。
