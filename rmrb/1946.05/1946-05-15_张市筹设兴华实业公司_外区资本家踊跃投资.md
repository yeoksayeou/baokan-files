　　Zhangjiakou City Prepares to Establish Xinghua Industrial Company
    Capitalists from Other Areas Eagerly Invest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th] Since the preparations for the establishment of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region's Xinghua Industrial Company, figures from the business community both inside and outside the Liberated Area, as well as general merchants, have enthusiastically subscribed to shares and invested. The company originally set its total capital at 250,000,000 yuan, and now various sectors have subscribed up to 200,000,000 yuan. The various factories and companies under its jurisdiction have also raised more than 100,000,000 yuan in share capital. In recent days, many industrialists and businessmen from outside the Liberated Area have sent letters to the company inquiring about its operating nature and scope, as well as the rights and limits of shareholders. Many capitalists arriving here, after visiting the operational status of the company's various factories, have expressed great approval for the democratic government's policy of supporting and encouraging the development of private enterprises. Some capitalists, due to funds not being remitted immediately, have mostly pre-subscribed to investment amounts with the preparatory office. Mr. Lin Mingqi, who came to Zhangjiakou from Tianjin and Beijing, invested 600,000 yuan in cash in one go. The person in charge of the company's preparatory office recently told our agency: "Based on the enthusiastic share subscriptions from all parties, it is estimated that the original total amount of fundraising can be completed by the end of this month, and it will be exceeded. Once the share capital is raised, the original government investment will be repaid as soon as possible, and the entire enterprise will be converted into private ownership."

　　张市筹设兴华实业公司
    外区资本家踊跃投资
    【新华社张家口九日电】晋察冀边区兴华实业公司，自筹备成立以来，解放区内外企业界人士及一般商民，均踊跃认股投资。该公司原定资本总额为二十五万万元，现已由各界分认达二十万万元，所属各厂、各公司亦募得股金一万万余元。连日来解放区以外各工商人士，投函向该公司询问经营性质与范围以及股东权限等问题者甚多，络绎抵此的许多资本家，于参观该公司所属各厂经营状况后，对民主政府扶助与奖励私营企业发展的政策，均极表赞同，有些资本家因款项未能即刻汇来，多向筹备处预认投资的额数。由平津来张的林明棋先生，一次即以现款入股六十余万元。该公司筹备处负责人顷语本社记者称：“根据各方踊跃入股状况估计，本月底当可完成原定的募集总额，并将超过。一俟股款募足，即尽先偿付原来政府的投资，将全部企业转为私营”。
