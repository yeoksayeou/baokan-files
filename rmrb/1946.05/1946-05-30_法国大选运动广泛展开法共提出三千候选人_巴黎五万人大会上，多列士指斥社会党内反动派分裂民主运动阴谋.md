　　【New China News Agency, Yan'an, 27th Dispatch】Paris: The election campaign for representatives to the second Constituent Assembly in France after the war is now widely underway, and the work of various French political parties in nominating their lists of candidates has come to an end. The French Communist Party, the largest party in the first Constituent Assembly, has put forward nearly three thousand candidates. The general election will be held on June 2nd. This election will determine whether France continues to follow the new democratic direction of development since liberation, or returns to its outdated old system that had gone bankrupt during the war. At a recent rally of 50,000 people in Paris jointly convened by the French Communist Party and the Republican Resistance Alliance, French Communist Party leader Thorez pointed out: Just as Hitler used talk of peace to cover up his preparations for war, French reactionaries are also attempting to maintain the privileges of the trusts and deprive the people of their freedom and welfare under the guise of talking about freedom and defending property, and most of those who voted against the new constitution were deceived by this kind of deception by the reactionaries. Thorez called on the French people to defend economic and social rights, to defend universal suffrage and proportional representation, the separation of church and state, the separation of church and schools, and not to delay the Senate demanded by the people. Loyal French patriots are now striving to use a democratic united front to oppose the reactionary united front. As is well known, the Popular Republican Movement's alliance with all reactionary right-wing camps largely determined the rejection of the new democratic constitution, while the Socialist Party leaders' ambivalence, hesitation, and failure to expose the reactionaries' conspiracies and tricks, and to explain the essence of the constitution to readers, but merely an attitude of defending a unicameral parliament, greatly helped the reactionaries. According to "Carrefour" newspaper: About one million Socialist Party voters cast negative votes. Now, in his election speeches, Socialist Party Secretary-General Mayer is not calling on the people of the Republic to unite and fight against the rising reactionaries; on the contrary, he is clamoring against the Communist Party. The Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement have recently passed the so-called slogan of "striving for power," prioritizing the interests of their parties above all else. The government organs, judicial organs, and courts under their control have adopted a policy of tolerating the reactionaries. The leader of the fascist "Croix-de-Feu," Bagnagal, was recently released and participated in the election, while Daladier, still in the capacity of honorary chairman of the Radical Socialist Party, continues to defend the Munich policy. Therefore, Parisians say they have not seen such pro-fascist frenzy propaganda for a long time. All the policies of the reactionaries are concentrated on one point, which is to use anti-communist slogans and slanders to split the democratic forces. However, the French people have begun to see through this trick, and the Socialist Party's policies are being condemned by the party's lower-level members. Several Socialist Party provincial and local organizations have opposed the candidates in the province selected by the party leadership. This fact proves that in the face of the arrogant attacks of the reactionaries, all democratic forces in France will unite and give the due counterattack.

　　法国大选运动广泛展开法共提出三千候选人
    巴黎五万人大会上，多列士指斥社会党内反动派分裂民主运动阴谋
    【新华社延安二十七日电】巴黎讯：战后法国第二个立宪会议代表的选举运动，现正广泛展开，法国各政党推选其候选人名单的工作，已告结束。第一个立宪会议中，第一大党法国共产党，已提出了将近三千名候选人。大选将于六月二日举行，这次大选将决定法国继续遵循自解放后所走的新民主主义发展方向，抑或恢复其在战时已遭破产的陈腐的旧制度。在最近法共与共和抵抗同盟所召开的巴黎五万人的大会上，法共领袖多列士指出：正如希特勒曾以谈论和平来掩盖其进行战争的准备，法国反动派也在谈论自由和保卫财产的掩盖下，企图维持托拉斯的特权，剥夺人民的自由与福利，而大多数投票反对新宪法的人，就受了反动派这种欺骗。多列士号召法人保卫经济与社会权利，保卫普选权及比例代表制、政教分离、教会与学校分离等原则，并且不要拖延人民要求的参院。法国忠诚的爱国者，现在正努力以民主联合阵线来反对反动的联合阵线。如众所周知，人民共和党之与一切反动的右翼阵营联合一起，曾大半决定了新民主宪法之遭受否决，而社会党领导者的三心二意、犹预不前，不去揭破反动派的阴谋诡计，给读者说明宪法的实质，却仅仅只为一院制国会辩护的态度，便大大帮助了反动派。据“十字街头报”所载：约一百万社会党选民投了反对票，在现在社会党总书记梅耶在其竞选演说中，不是号召共和国人民团结起来，与正在抬头的反动派斗争；反之，他却叫嚣反对共产党。社会党与人民共和党最近都通过了所谓“争取当政”的口号，而以一党利益高于一切，由它们所掌握着的政府机关，司法机关及法庭，则对反动派采取纵容政策，法西斯“火十字团”的领袖巴尼加利最近被释放，并参加选举，达拉第则仍以急进社会党的名誉主席资格，继续辩护慕尼黑政策。因此，巴黎人说他们已好久没看到象现在这样的亲法西斯的狂热宣传了。一切反动派的政策，都集中在一点上，就是用反共的口号与污蔑，来分裂民主力量。但是，法国人民已开始看穿这种诡计，社会党的政策正受到该党下层党员的谴责，有好些社会党的省级地方组织，已在反对该党领导机关所获的该省候选人，这个事实证明，面对着反动派嚣张的攻击，法国一切民主力量必将团结一致，并予以应有的反击。
