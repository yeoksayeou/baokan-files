    [Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhuadian, 25th] Hankou News: After receiving Memorandum No. 6 of Xuan from General Li Xiannian, Commander of the Central Plains Military Region of the CCP, the Hankou Central Executive Group (Ninth Group) has decided to send a special group to the Jianghan area on the 26th of this month to investigate the situation of the Kuomintang army besieging the CCP troops in the An(lu) Ying(shan) Shou(shan) area. The American representative of the special group is Lieutenant Colonel White Lowe [transliteration], the Kuomintang representative is Lieutenant Colonel Guan Wenyang, and the CCP representative is Major Ma Saibing.

This trip of the executive group to Tong was to inspect the area upon the order of the Beiping Military Mediation Department. After the group arrived in Tong, the Nantong Kuomintang authorities immediately notified Jiang Keding, the CCP representative, saying: The situation is tense, it is best to go out less. Even when Jiang was resting on the hotel balcony where he was staying, a duty deputy squad leader ordered him to go inside, saying rudely: "Go back quickly, this is an order from above." Jiang immediately reprimanded him and lodged a verbal protest with Yang Chao, the Kuomintang representative. Yang Chao then reprimanded the deputy squad leader, saying that he would be punished and offered a verbal apology to the CCP representative.

    【新华社宣化店二十五日电】汉口讯：汉口中心执行小组（第九小组）接获中共中原军区司令李先念将军之宣字第六号备忘录后，已决定派一特别小组，于本月二十六日前往江汉地区一带，调查国民党军在安（陆）应（山）寿（山）地区围攻中共部队之情形。该特别小组美方代表白洛×中校国民党代表为关文杨中校，中共代表为马塞冰少校。
    【新华社如皋廿三日电】本月一日乘机飞南通之执行小组人员，于十三日夜乘汽车返抵如皋。此次执行小组赴通，系奉北平军调部令前往视察。小组抵通后，南通国民党当局即通知中共代表蒋克定称：形势紧张，少出为妙。甚至蒋氏在其所住的旅馆晒台上休息时，竟遭一值班副班长喝令进去，蛮横地说：“快回去，这是上面的命令”。蒋氏即予训斥，并向国民党代表杨超提出口头抗议。杨超即予该副班长训斥，彼称即将予以处分，并向中共代表口头道歉。
