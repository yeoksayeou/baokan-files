　　[Report from this newspaper in Handan] Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi, representatives of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, together with Ms. Wei Haining of the Yellow River Commission (an American, social scientist, and director of UNRRA's Henan region), arrived in Beijing on the 15th. They immediately met with Xue Dubi, director of the National Water Conservancy Commission, along with Comrade Zhou Enlai, reiterating the original plan to maintain the Heze Agreement. Mr. Xue stated that a joint meeting of all parties must be convened to resolve the issue. Xue Dubi insisted that the levees must be restored, the river dredged, and the residents within the riverbed relocated before the breach could be closed. The reactionary faction of the Kuomintang is acting perversely, disregarding the reasonable demands and suggestions of Chinese and foreign individuals, and acting obstinately. It is reported that our representative will soon visit President Song and the head of UNRRA to negotiate and argue forcefully based on reason.
    [Report from this newspaper in Heze] After Comrades Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government's representative delegation to the Yellow River Commission in Kaifeng went to Nanjing, our representative remaining in Kaifeng requested Wang Huixian, the person in charge of the Yellow River Commission stationed in Kaifeng, to allow our representative, Comrade Cheng Run, to be stationed at the Huayuankou breach closure project site in order to promptly understand the progress of the project. The Kuomintang side, using the excuse of "needing to ask the Central Government for instructions," deliberately delayed the matter. Currently, our representative has lodged a protest with the Kuomintang side and is continuing negotiations.

　　国方仍不顾中外复堤合理要求
    我驻京代表据理力争
    我要求驻员花园口，竟遭无理拖延。
    【本报邯郸讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府代表赵明甫、王笑一偕同黄委会危海宁氏（美人，社会科学家，联总驻华河南区主任）等三人一行，于十五日抵京后，即会同周恩来同志会见全国水利委员会主任薛笃弼氏，重申维持荷泽协议原案，薛氏表示必须召开各方联席会议解决。笃弼薛氏则坚主必须复堤浚河、迁移河床内居民后始能堵口。国民党反动派倒行逆施，竟不顾中外人士合理要求与建议，一意孤行。闻我代表日内即将晋谒宋院长及联总负责人协商，据理力争。
    【本报荷泽讯】晋冀鲁豫边府驻开封黄委会代表团赵明甫、王笑一二同志去南京后，我留汴代表即向黄委会驻汴负责人王恢先，要求由我方代表成润同志驻花园口堵口工程处，以便及时了解工程进行情况，国民党方面，竟借口“须请示中央”，故意拖延，现我方代表一面已向国民党方面提出抗议，一面正继续交涉中。
