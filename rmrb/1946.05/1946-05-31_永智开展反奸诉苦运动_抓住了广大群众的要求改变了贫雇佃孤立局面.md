　　[Our newspaper's Weixian dispatch] Yongzhi County is launching a large-scale anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. Yao Lou Village first launched a struggle against the traitor Yu Fengzao. From his grandfather's generation, Yu Fengzao had been a ruling figure in the village. After the incident [Japanese invasion], he surrendered to the enemy and served as a staff officer in the puppet army of Sun Jingming, committing many evils that the masses deeply hated. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China [1943], he falsely accused Tian Fuyuan of stealing his grain, not only detaining him but also beating Tian's elderly mother to death, and fined him 120 yuan. When a friend came to the home of poor peasant Gao Jian, he insisted that Gao was connected to the "Eighth Route Army" and led the local militia to surround the house at night, throwing more than a dozen hand grenades inside. His younger brother, Yu Fengxi, as the village deputy and head of the self-defense corps, was even more abhorrent. He once threatened and raped Yu Longzhang's daughter with a gun. Both of Yu Longzhang's daughters died of anger within days. After our army liberated Yongzhi last October, Yu Fengxi fled to Luonan, leaving Yu Fengzao behind. Yu secretly threatened the masses while probing the situation. In the fourth month of the lunar calendar [May], about 700 people, including farmers, hired laborers, women, and children of Yao Lou, found a Type 38 rifle, four "single fighters" [likely refers to single-shot rifles], and two baskets of small hand grenades in Yu Fengzao's home. Filled with indignation, the masses handed Yu over to the government for detention. After Yu was detained, the people of Yao Lou welcomed a new world. Everyone in the village was very happy, even the small landlords saying, "This has taken away a sickness from us." The number of peasant association members increased from 100 to 150. All the poor peasants and most of the middle peasants joined, there were more than 20 militiamen, and there were also 24 trade union members, totaling more than 190 people. The experience from Yao Lou's anti-traitor grievance-airing revealed a few points: (1) It proves that anti-traitor grievance-airing is the urgent demand of all levels of the masses in the newly liberated areas, because of the killings, exploitation, and rapes inflicted on the masses by traitors over eight years, which have accumulated year after year and become unbearable. As the masses of Yao Lou said, "Since the Eighth Route Army entered Yongzhi, we have had the intention to struggle against Yu Fengzao." The rapid expansion of mass organizations in Yao Lou changed the isolated situation of hired laborers, poor peasants, and orphans. (2) It can be seen that the broad masses most hate the heinous traitors and the masterminds who controlled the puppet district and township governments. For example, Tian Defa, a poor peasant in Yao Lou, served as a puppet village chief for several years, but he was actually a puppet who listened entirely to Yu Fengzao's orders. Therefore, the masses tolerated him and only asked him to confess his mistakes in public. (3) We should be good at organizing joint struggles, because heinous traitors have committed many evils, affecting an entire township, district, or county. Therefore, organizing several joint struggles will better demonstrate the power of the masses.

　　永智开展反奸诉苦运动
    抓住了广大群众的要求改变了贫雇佃孤立局面
    【本报威县讯】永智全县正在展开大规模的反奸诉苦运动，姚楼村首先掀起了一个反汉奸于凤早的斗争，于凤早从他祖父起辈辈就是这村的统治人物，事变后投敌，在伪军孙经明部当参谋长，作恶多端，群众无不痛恨。民国三十二年，诬赖田福源偷他的粮食，不但把人扣起来，还把田的老母痛打致死，另外还罚了一百二十元。贫农高俭家来了一个朋友，他硬说高通“八路”，晚上便带领团丁将房包围，向屋内扔了十几个手榴弹。其弟于凤喜当本村村副兼自卫团长，更是可恶，曾举枪威胁，强奸于龙章之女，不几天，这两个闺女便气死了。去年十月我军解放永智后，于凤喜逃往洛南，留下于凤早，一面暗中威胁群众，一面打听动静，旧历四月份，姚楼的农民、雇工、妇女、儿童约七百余人，在于凤早的家里找出一枝三八式枪，四个单打一，两筐小手榴弹，群情激愤，便将于送交政府扣押。于被扣起后，姚楼的人民换了个新世界，全村人都十分喜欢，连小地主都说“这可给俺去了一块病。”农会会员由一百人扩大到一百五十人，全部贫农及大部中农都涌进来，民兵有二十多个，还有工会会员二十四人，共计一百九十多人。从姚楼反奸诉苦中，得到几点经验：（一）证明了反奸诉苦是目前新解放区各阶层群众的迫切要求，因八年受汉奸们加给群众的枪杀、压榨、奸淫，年年积累早就忍无可忍了。正如姚楼的群众说：“自八路军进永智后，我们就有斗争于凤早的心思。”姚楼群众组织的很快扩大，改变了以雇佃贫孤立的局面。（二）可以看出广大群众最痛恨的是罪大恶极的汉奸和掌握伪区乡政权的主谋份子。如姚楼贫农田得法，当了几年伪村长，实际是傀儡，凡事全听于凤早的命令。因此群众就宽容他，只叫他当众坦白认错。（三）应当善于组织联合斗争，因为罪大恶极的汉奸，他们作恶甚多，影响有达一乡、一区、一县者。所以组织几个联合斗争，就更能显示群众的威力。
