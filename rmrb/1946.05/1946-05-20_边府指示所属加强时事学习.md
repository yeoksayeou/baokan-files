　　The Border Region Government Directs Subordinates to Strengthen Current Affairs Study
    [This newspaper's report] The Border Region government here, in order to cooperate with the current situation's development and strengthen cadre education, has issued instructions to various localities, pointing out that the current domestic situation is at a critical juncture. The Kuomintang reactionaries' plot to expand the civil war should arouse serious vigilance. We should further strengthen our work and prepare ideologically and practically for the sudden large-scale offensives and attacks of the fascist reactionaries, overcome the paralyzing thought that peace has already arrived, pay attention to the development of the situation, and strengthen the study of current affairs.
