　　【Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 24th】In January, Fucun Village, Pingyao, conducted a struggle to eliminate traitors and settle accounts, but it failed to genuinely mobilize the masses. After the cadres left, the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets, led by Wang Shijie, the former puppet district assistant, regrouped their strength to launch a counter-attack against the masses through clan relations (the village is mainly composed of the Ren and Wang surnames) and bribery. After making secret arrangements, they forced households to participate in the so-called "mass meeting," with punishment for those who did not attend and expulsion from the "clan." They also arrested active members of the liquidation struggle on false pretenses, forcing the masses to return the land they had obtained through liquidation to the puppet personnel, and fabricated rumors to intimidate the masses. When the rent reduction training class work team arrived in the village, the masses were afraid to tell the cadres the truth and dared not attend meetings. The cadres then went to help the masses with production and conduct in-depth investigations. At a meeting of active members, it was discovered that landlords were passing on public grain quotas to tenant farmers, and the masses were afraid to speak out. The work team started by addressing the issue of public grain, discovered new active members, and then, in coordination with the Farmers' Association, first united sixteen tenant farmers, providing them with special rent reduction education. Through them, nearly a hundred tenant farmers were mobilized to launch a struggle against the landlord Wang Weiran to reduce rent and redeem land. Wang Shiji, whose family was ruined by Wang Weiran's usury and plunder, immediately recovered twenty-two mu of land, which immediately motivated farmers throughout the village to rise up and fight against puppet personnel and landlord bullies, recover the land seized by traitors and puppets, and launch a rent reduction and account settlement movement against landlords, increasing wages. A large number of newly emerging activists joined the Farmers' Association and the village government, eliminating saboteurs and thoroughly defeating the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets.

　　平遥阜村从发动佃户减租中彻底打垮奸伪反攻
    农民收回被夺去的土地
    【新华社兴县二十四日电】平遥阜村在一月间曾进行过反奸清算斗争，但未能真正发动群众。干部一走，以前伪区助理员王世杰为首的敌伪残余势力，通过宗族关系（全村主要是任、王两姓）与金钱收买，重新团聚力量向群众反攻。他们先进行秘密布置后，挨户强迫参加所谓“群众会”，谁不到会就要受处罚，并开除“家族”。又借故扣捕清算斗争中的积极分子，迫使群众将清算所得土地，退给伪人员，并捏造谣言恫吓群众。当租减训练班工作组到达该村时，群众不敢向干部说实话，不敢参加会议。干部便去帮助群众生产，进行深入调查，在积极分子会上，发现地主把公粮都转嫁在佃户身上，群众有苦不敢说。工作组就先从解决公粮问题着手，发现新的积极分子，然后协同农会，先团结十六个佃户，专门给予减租教育，通过他们发动起近百佃户，向地主王唯然进行减租回赎斗争。被王唯然累利掠夺以致家破人亡的王世继，当即收回土地二十二亩，马上推动全村农民，纷纷起来向伪人员及地主恶霸斗争，收回被奸伪夺去的土地，并向地主展开减租清算增资运动，大批新起的积极分子参加了农会与村政权，淘汰了破坏分子，彻底打垮了敌伪残余势力。
