　　Nanjing Talks on the Yellow River Returning to its Old Course
    Our Representative Strongly Advocates Full-Scale Dike Restoration
    Kuomintang Still Does Not Abandon Simultaneous Repair and Blocking
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing: The Executive Yuan's Water Conservancy Commission invited representatives from UNRRA, CNRRA, the Yellow River Blocking Engineering Bureau, and the Chinese Communist Party for a symposium on the 17th and 18th to discuss the issue of the Yellow River blocking and dike restoration project. The discussions focused on two points: First, to accelerate the repair of downstream dikes, all parties agreed and are actively rushing to repair them; second, regarding the continued progress of the blocking project, UNRRA, CNRRA, and experts advocated that, in order to achieve the principle of completing both blocking and dike restoration simultaneously, piling and rock throwing should continue, initially to a height of about one to two meters, and then continue to coordinate based on the downstream dike restoration situation. The CCP representative advocated concentrating efforts on dike restoration and carrying out piling and rock throwing work after the autumn floods. No unanimous agreement was reached on the 17th. The meeting continued on the 18th and decided that the downstream dike restoration project should commence before July 5th, and the Huayuankou blocking project should continue to proceed in coordination, with the principle of not causing downstream disasters. The results of the talks will be submitted to superiors by each party for handling.

　　南京商谈黄河归故
    我代表力主全力复堤
    国民党仍不放弃修堵并进
    【新华社延安十九日电】据中央社南京电：行政院水利委员会十七、十八连日邀请联总、行总、黄河堵口工程局及中共代表，举行座谈会，商谈黄河堵口复堤工程问题，会谈集中两点：一为加速修复下游堤防，各方一致同意，积极赶修；一为堵口工程继续进行问题，联总、行总及专家，主张为达成堵口复堤同时完成之原则应继续打桩抛石，先抛至一公尺至二公尺左右，再视下游复堤情形，继续配合。中共代表主张集中力量进行复堤，俟秋季大泛后，再进行打桩抛石工作。十七日未获一致协议。十八日续开，决定下游复堤工程于七月五日以前即行动工，花园口堵口工程继续配合进行，以不使下游发生灾害为原则。商谈结果，由各方分别呈请上峰办理。
