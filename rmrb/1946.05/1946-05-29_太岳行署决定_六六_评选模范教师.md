　　Taiyue Administrative Office Decides
    To Select Model Teachers for "June 6th"
    [Report from our Taiyue Correspondent] The Taiyue Administrative Office has decided that all counties should universally hold commemorative meetings, celebrations, and symposiums for this year's June 6th Teachers' Day. The specific measures are as follows: (1) In old liberated areas, each joint school district should convene meetings of its teachers to promote model examples, summarize experiences, and select models to participate in county-wide symposiums. (2) Counties should provide material rewards for the model deeds and excellent teaching materials of model teachers. The criteria are those who implement the educational policies and have significant achievements, and are supported by the masses. (3) In new liberated areas, meetings should be held to convey this year's educational work guidelines and establish the view that teachers should serve the people. (4) Regardless of whether they are old or new liberated areas, meetings held by joint school districts should not be later than June 6th; county meetings should not be later than July 7th. (5) Good local teaching materials (supplementary teaching materials) should be reviewed and rewarded by each county, and then sent to the Administrative Office before June 10th for selection, reprinting, and rewards. The Education Department of the Border Region Government has decided to convene a border-region-wide cultural and educational conference this winter. It is hoped that after the June 6th symposium, all counties will effectively consolidate and improve existing models, cultivate and discover new models, so that they can participate in the border-region-wide cultural and educational conference after being elected at that time.
