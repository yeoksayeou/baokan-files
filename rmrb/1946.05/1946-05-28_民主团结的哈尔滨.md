　　Democratic and United Harbin
　　Lin Huo
　　Since the Democratic Allied Army entered Harbin at 8 p.m. on April 28th, it has only been twelve or thirteen days until today, but sensitive citizens have already felt Harbin changing.
　　For four months, the Kuomintang's "reception officials" were high above, reigning over the 800,000 citizens of Harbin. The officials opened their mouths calling people "puppet civilians", closing their mouths calling people "puppet civilians," spitting out contemptuous voices from between their teeth: "Ban everything!" (what was announced to be banned was Chinese-style, what was advocated was American-style)! In this way, perms, high heels, fine dining, dancers, nurses, going to dance halls... truly flourished for a time. What was not banned, nor willing to be banned, was the rampant behavior of enemies and puppets, with 3,986 robbery cases. Only three days after the Soviet army withdrew, thirty-nine robbery cases occurred in Daowai alone. In the long one hundred and twenty-odd days, not a single Japanese war criminal or heinous traitor was punished. The Kuomintang "reception officials" were busy rolling banknotes, loading gold, and transporting silver...
　　The citizens' conclusion was: the Kuomintang "reception officials" did not even mention giving the people of Northeast China the right to autonomy, or letting the people of Northeast China manage Northeast China; even democratic cooperation with the people of Northeast China was out of the question. Therefore, they gave the "reception officials" a nickname: "Chongqing people." Although the officials kept saying "See you in Jinzhou" when they left, in contrast, the 800,000 citizens of Harbin will never forget the date of April 28th. From that night on, the sound of gunfire was no longer heard, and robbery cases were no longer seen. The people's army marched into the city in a mighty procession from the Jihong Bridge. In the twilight of dusk, bursts of cheers echoed along the streets. On Jiudao Street, a barber said to himself, "This is truly our common people's army, look how amiable they are!"
　　A college student from Sankeshu enthusiastically discussed with his neighbors the stories of the Democratic Allied Army soldiers carrying water, sweeping courtyards, and teaching common sense to the people. A soda vendor said, "The real deal has arrived, the fake deal (referring to puppet brands) has disappeared!"
　　The people's army—the Democratic Allied Army—clearly stated in the first article that it was willing to "cooperate with all people who advocate peace and democracy to realize the peaceful and democratic demands of the people of Harbin and oppose civil war." Under the premise of serving the people of Northeast China, the tasks of the Democratic Allied Army were: "Thoroughly eliminate bandits, secret agents, and the remnants of Japanese fascism, assist the peaceful and democratic movement in Harbin, guarantee the democratic rights of the people, thoroughly promote democratic politics, assist the development of industry and commerce, improve people's lives, raise the status of women, establish education, relieve disaster victims, and build sanitary affairs"... On May 4th, 150,000 people in Harbin warmly held a welcome rally for the Democratic Allied Army, where representatives from all walks of life and all strata of society, such as gentry, farmers, workers, women, and youth, unanimously issued a call for unity between the army and the people, to defend peace and democracy, and build a new Harbin. Mr. He Zhian, a prominent figure in Harbin's financial circles, and Mr. Zhang Tingge, a representative of businessmen, praised the Democratic Allied Army for cooperating with all people who advocate peace and democracy to realize the peaceful and democratic demands of the people of Harbin and oppose civil war. Mr. He's comment said: "Strict discipline, great principles." Mr. Zhang said: "This people's army with great spirit and great strength, undertaking the important task of defending peace and democracy, is not only a celebration for the 800,000 people of Harbin, but also a celebration for the future of China." The spirit of democratic cooperation between the Communists and people from all walks of life in Northeast China is also infused into local government. The Songjiang Provincial Government, which was formally established in Harbin on May 5th, is a typical example of thoroughly implementing the "three-thirds system." Among the nine members elected at this Songjiang Provincial Government People's Representative Conference, in addition to Feng Yiyun, Zhong Ziyun, and Wang Xueming, who were Communist Party members, Ms. Han Youtong, was a member of the Democratic League, a central executive committee member of the National Salvation Association, and now also serves as the Director of Education. Mr. Li Zhiquan joined the Kuomintang in 1926 and is a progressive figure within the Kuomintang, now also serving as the Deputy Director of Education. Mr. Du Guangyu once served as a professor of economics at Northeastern University and now serves as the Director of Civil Affairs. Others, such as Mr. Yun Sheng, Mr. Zhang Anqi, and Mr. Fu Runcheng, are also people in the province who advocate peace and democracy. The newly received Harbin Municipal Government has now hired Mr. He Zhian, a prominent figure in Harbin's financial circles, as the Director of Finance. Mr. Zhang Baiyan, a prominent figure in the medical community, as the Director of Health. According to Mayor Liu Chengdong, other administrative candidates will also be selected from respected social democratic figures as much as possible.
　　Under the principle of democratic unity, and under the mobilization to defend peace and democracy, Harbin has now begun to embark on various construction paths. Liu, the shopkeeper of Dongyuanxing Grain Store in Taohua Alley, wrote a celebratory poem: "The People's Army enters the city, celebrating peace and prosperity together, shops open, factories start, no robbery during the day, no gunfire at night, living and working in peace and contentment, sharing peace." This is representative of the general public's opinion. Electricity, telephones, and tap water throughout the city have never stopped. The working enthusiasm of employees in various agencies is exceptionally high. The city's middle schools, which had been suspended for a period of time, officially resumed classes on May 1st. More than eleven cinemas screen films every day, and Zhaolin Cinema is screening the new Soviet film "Crushing Violent Japan," which narrates the history of Japanese invasion of China and the Soviet army's liberation of Northeast China, to entertain the People's Self-Defense Army.
　　The people's emancipation movement throughout the city has begun to unfold. Staff members of the Political Department of the People's Self-Defense Army, in coordination with local staff members, organize people's movement work teams to publicize and organize the masses. On April 29th, a mass rally of ten thousand people was held at Sankeshu Elementary School. At the meeting, worker representative Hu Tieming, women representative Zhang Xiuying, and others, put forward brilliant opinions on the people's emancipation, and their speeches were extremely moving. In recent days, farmers from various villages in Sankeshu, Wangjiatun, Yuanjiatun, Xiaomiaotun, and Fengjiawazi, have held meetings, measuring land and preparing to distribute "Yutuo land." A turning over meeting of no less than fifteen thousand people was held at Taiping Bridge, opposing the civil war and demanding peace.
　　The 1933 Harbin Electrical Workers' Great Strike once caused a sensation throughout Northeast China. Now, all employees of the Harbin Tram Factory, inheriting the glorious tradition of the anti-Japanese struggle, convened employees of the Tram Factory on the seventh of this month with union organizers to hold the founding meeting of the Harbin Tram Union. Two hundred workers attended, uniting to seek revenge against the traitors and secret agents who exploited the workers, settle the blood debt, and elected Du Weiqiang, Wang Guangfu, Wang Shiyu, Hu Wenxuan and other five as standing committee members. In addition, the electricity bureau and others are also preparing to organize trade unions. Under the spirit of democratic unity, Harbin is advancing.

### 民主团结的哈尔滨

　　民主团结的哈尔滨
    林火
    自上月二十八日晚八时，民主联军进驻哈尔滨起，至今天止，为期不过十二三天，但敏感的市民已感到哈尔滨在变化着。
    四个月来，国民党的“接收大员”曾高高在上，君临在哈市八十万市民的头上。大员开口“伪民”，闭口“伪民”，从牙齿缝里迸出轻蔑的声音：“取缔一切”（被宣布取缔的是中国式，被提倡的是美国式）！就这样，烫发、高跟鞋、吃大餐、舞女、护士、进跳舞场……真是盛行一时。而没有取缔，也不愿取缔的，是敌伪横行，抢案达三九八六起。苏军撤退只三天，仅仅道外一处，抢案接连发生了三十九起。在长长的一百二十多天里，没有一个日寇战犯或罪大恶极的汉奸被处罪。国民党“接收大员”们忙的是卷钞票，载黄金，运白银……。
    市民们的结论是：国民党的“接收大员”不要说给东北人民以自治的权利，要东北人民管理东北；就是与东北人民民主合作也谈不到，因此给“接收大员”起了个雅号：“重庆人”。虽然大员们临走时口口声声说“锦州见”，相比之下，哈尔滨的八十万市民，将永远不会忘记四月二十八号这个日子。打那天夜里起，从此再也听不见枪声，看不到抢案。人民的军队浩浩荡荡由霁虹桥走向市里。在黄昏的暮色里，阵阵传出夹道欢呼的声音。在九道街，一个理发匠自言自语地说：“这才是咱们老百姓的军队，看他们多么和气”！
    一个来自三棵树的大学生，指手划脚的向他的邻居们谈论着民主联军战士们给老百姓担水、扫院、教常识的故事。一个卖汽水的小贩说：“真牌的来了，假牌的（指伪牌）没影啦！”
    人民的军队——民主联军，开宗明义第一条，即郑重说明：“愿与一切主张和平民主人士合作，实现哈市人民和平民主要求，反对内战”。在为东北人民服务的前提下，民主联军的任务是：“彻底肃清土匪特务及日本法西斯残余势力，协助哈市的和平民主运动，保障人民的民主权利，彻底推行民主政治，协助工商业发展，改善人民生活，提高妇女地位，兴办教育，救济灾难民，建设卫生事宜”……五月四日，哈市十五万人民热烈举行欢迎民主联军大会上，士绅、农人、工人、妇女、青年等各界各阶层的代表，一致发出军民团结一致，保卫和平民主，建设新哈尔滨的呼声。哈市金融界名流何治安先生，商人代表张庭阁先生称赞民主联军与一切主张和平民主人士合作，实现哈市人民和平民主要求，反对内战的宗旨。何先生的评语说：“纪律严明，主张伟大”。张先生说：“以此伟大精神，伟大力量的人民军队，来担负保卫和平民主的重大任务，不仅为哈市八十万人民庆，且为中国之前途庆”。共产党人与东北各阶层人士民主合作的精神，同样贯注到地方政府中去。五月五日，在哈尔滨正式成立的民主自治的松江省政府，就是彻底贯彻三三制的典型。在此次松江省府人民代表会上，当选之九名委员中，除冯伊云、钟子云、王学明等三人为共产党员外，如韩幽桐（女）先生，为民主同盟会员，救国会中央执行委员，现兼任教育厅长。李植权先生，民国十五年加入国民党，为国民党内进步人士，现兼任教育厅副厅长。杜光预先生，曾任东北大学经济学教授，现兼任民政厅长。其他如蕴生、张安耆、傅润成先生等，亦均为该省主张和平民主人士。刚刚接收的哈尔滨市政府，现已聘请哈市金融界名流何治安先生，为财政局长。医学界名流张柏岩先生，为卫生局长。其他各行政人选，据刘成栋市长告诉记者，亦尽量在敦等社会民主人士中。
    在民主团结原则下，在保卫和平民主的动员下，哈尔滨现已开始走上各种建设的道路。桃花巷东源兴粮栈叫刘掌柜的写了一首庆祝词：“民军入城，共庆升平，商店开业，工厂开工，日无抢案，夜无枪声，安居乐业，共享太平”。这是一般市民意见的代表。全市电灯、电话、自来水等，始终没有停止过。各机关职员工作情绪，异常高涨。曾一度停顿的市内各中学，已于五月一日正式复课。十一家以上电影院，每天放映，兆麟电影院并放映苏联新片《粉碎暴日》，是叙述日寇侵略中国历史，及苏军解放东北的记实，以招待人民自卫军。
    全市人民翻身运动已开始展开。人民自卫军政治部工作人员，配合地方工作人员组织民运工作队，宣传与组织群众。四月廿九日在三棵树小学，曾举行万人群众大会，会中工人代表胡铁明、妇女代表张秀英等，对于人民翻身，均提出精彩的意见，演说极为动人。日来三棵树各屯农民，王家屯、袁家屯、小庙屯、冯家洼子屯的农民，都纷纷开会，丈量地亩，准备分配“渔拓地”。太平桥召开了不下万五千多人的翻身大会，反对内战，要求和平。
    一九三三年哈市电业工人大罢工，曾轰动全东北。现在哈市电车厂全体员工，继承了当年抗日斗争的光荣传统，在本月七日联合工会筹备人员，召集电车厂员工，举行哈市电车工会成立大会，出席工友二百名，联合向剥削工人的汉奸特务复仇，清算血债，并选出杜维强、王光复、王时榆、胡文宣等五人为常务委员。此外如电业局等，亦正在筹备组织工会。在民主团结的精神下，哈尔滨在前进着。
