　　Qi Zixiu's Treachery Leaves Behind a Source of Calamity
    Mole Crickets Plague Guan County
    Government Organizes the Masses to Capture and Eliminate Them
    The Soviet-Anhui Border Region Relieves Famine Through Grub Digging
    [Xinhua News Agency, Weixian, General Branch of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu] The second, fourth, and sixth districts of Guan County, first district of Southern Hebei, have recently experienced a mole cricket infestation. One can grab more than thirty mole crickets on the ground with one hand, and many wheat and spring seedlings have been bitten to death. The government is now organizing the masses to actively capture the pests and has reported to the commissioner's office requesting loans to re-sow. The cause of the infestation is that the area was transformed into a depopulated zone for a long period due to the devastation inflicted by the puppet army of Qi Zixiu, added and commissioned by the Kuomintang authorities since 1942, which resulted in abandoned farmland.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 13th] Locust nymphs have been discovered in Jiashan, Taixing, Baoying and other counties in the Soviet-Anhui border region; as many as fifty-two nymphs have been found within one square foot. Local governments are now leading the masses to exterminate the locusts and protect the wheat harvest. In the Duiqiao district of Jiashan, six thousand disaster victims are engaged in digging for locusts. In ten days, they dug up 200 dan of pure locusts from 650 mu of land, which they exchanged with the government for over 100 shi of grain and 44 jin of bean cakes.

　　齐逆子修留下祸根
    冠县蝼蛄成灾
    政府组织群众捕灭
    苏皖边区刨蝻代赈
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社威县讯】冀南一分区冠县二、四、六各区，最近发生蝼蛄虫灾，在地面上一手可抓到三十多个蝼蛄，麦苗春苗多被咬死。现政府正一面组织群众积极捕捉，一面呈报专署，请求贷款，重新播种。虫灾发生原因，是民国三十一年以来，该地在国民党当局加了委的伪军齐子修部摧残下，曾长期变为无人区，耕地荒芜所致。
    【新华社淮阴十三日电】苏皖边区嘉山、泰兴、宝应等县境内发现蝗蝻，在一方尺内有发现五十二只者，现在各地政府正领导群众灭蝗，保卫麦收。嘉山对桥区内有灾民六千人从事挖蝗，十天中在六百五十亩面积内，挖得净蝗子二百担，向政府换得粮食百余石，豆饼四十四斤。
