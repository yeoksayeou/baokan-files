　　Kaifeng Talks Break Down
    Border Government Decides to Send Representatives to Beijing for Consultation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu General Branch, Handan News] The Jinji-Luyu Border Region Government’s representative delegation to the Yellow River Committee in Kaifeng telegraphed on the 9th, stating: "Xue Dubi, Director of the National Water Conservancy Commission of the Kuomintang government, went to Bian on the 2nd, not only making no mention of the Heze Agreement, but also stepping up the blocking of the Huayuankou project. The earthwork has been largely completed, and piling will soon be prepared. However, no preparations have been made for the dike reconstruction project north of the Longhai Railway. On the 20th of last month, during the talks in Huayuankou, all parties jointly decided to hold talks on the 8th, but these were suspended without explanation." It also stated: "Violating the Heze Agreement and continuing to block the breach is definitely the proposition of the Kuomintang authorities. All parties believe that the issues of stopping the blocking and first restoring the dikes and dredging the river cannot be resolved in Bian and must be negotiated in Nanjing." Based on this, our Jinji-Luyu Border Region Government has now decided to send Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi, two representatives from the Kaifeng delegation, to Nanjing to negotiate with the Kuomintang Central Government on the implementation of the Heze Agreement.

　　开封会谈宣告停顿
    边府决定派员赴京协商
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社邯郸讯】晋冀鲁豫边府驻开封黄委会代表团于九日来电称：“国民党政府全国水利委员会主任薛笃弼曾于二日赴汴，不仅对荷泽协议根本不提，且花园口堵口工程仍加紧进行，现土工业已大部完成，最近即准备打桩，而陇海路以北之复堤工程并未作任何准备。上月廿日，在花园口会谈时，各方共同决定在八日会谈，竟又无形停开。”又称：“违反荷泽协议，继续堵口，固系国民党当局之主张，各方认为停止堵口先行复堤浚河等问题在汴无法解决，须到南京协商。”据此，我晋冀鲁豫边区政府现已决定派开封代表团之赵明甫、王笑一二代表前赴南京，与国民党中央协商执行荷泽协议问题。
