　　Kuomintang Troops' Fierce Attack for 23 Days Unsuccessful
    Democratic Allied Forces Firmly Defend Sipingjie
    American and Chinese Newspapers Criticize the Kuomintang for Provoking Civil War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Sipingjie, 11th] The Northeast Democratic Allied Forces have bravely defended Sipingjie, now entering its 23rd day. This strong democratic fortress, after a prolonged and fierce attack by the Kuomintang troops concentrating seven divisions, coupled with aerial bombardment, remains steadfastly unmoved. Currently, the Kuomintang troops attacking Sipingjie include the 38th, 30th, and 50th Divisions of the New 1st Army, the 77th and 91st Divisions of the 71st Army, and the 182nd Division of the 60th Army, and the 195th Division of the 52nd Army—a total of ten divisions. They have been concentrating bombardment on Sipingjie with intense firepower of 1,800 shells per hour, but our Democratic Allied Forces have consistently held their ground. The people of Sipingjie are full of confidence, saying, "The Kuomintang can see the city, but they can't get in."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th] In the Benxi area, the fighting continues on the south side of the Taizi River. The old city of Benxi is located on the north bank of the Taizi River, while the new city (Miyahara) is on the south bank. The entire city stretches approximately twenty li from north to south. After the 52nd Army and the 22nd Division of the New 6th Army occupied the old city of Benxi, they are now advancing south along the Anshan-Shenyang Railway and its west side toward the new city. The main force of the 14th Division of the New 6th Army is concentrated along the Guzi, Da'anping, and Tangheyan line southwest of Benxi, attacking toward the Zhongtou Station, twenty li south of the new city of Benxi. Our forces are currently putting up a stiff resistance in the vicinity of the new city of Benxi. The 88th Division of the 71st Army, which participated in the Benxi battles, has reportedly been transported north to the Kaiyuan area a few days ago. In the Sipingjie area, fierce fighting continues.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] Moscow broadcasted today: Recently, many American and Chinese newspapers and radio stations have published commentaries on the current situation in China, unanimously pointing out the fact that the Chinese civil war has intensified again and demanding an unconditional cessation of the civil war. On April 30th, New York radio broadcasted: According to news from the Chinese government, the truce agreement with the Communists has been delayed because the Kuomintang army is attempting to occupy as many cities as possible in Manchuria. Associated Press correspondent Luo John in Nanjing reported on May 2nd: Military action has broken out again in Manchuria. This military action was provoked by the right-wing faction of the Kuomintang, who intend to create a favorable impression under the guise of clever propaganda and various rumors. Luo John pointed out that such propaganda is absurd. He also stated that if Chiang Kai-shek were to abolish the means of secret police and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in Manchuria, harmony could be restored. The American magazine *Newsweek* published on May 1st an essay by journalist Shisikeling, who had recently returned from Manchuria, recounting his conversations with Kuomintang soldiers captured by the Communist army in Benxihu. The Kuomintang soldiers all unanimously stated that they were unwilling to wage war against their compatriots. They said that they had recently been transferred to Manchuria on American ships. The officers told them that they were being transferred to disarm the Japanese army, but they later learned from wounded soldiers returning from the front that they were being transferred to fight a civil war. The Shanghai *Cultural Daily* wrote on May 3rd: Unfortunately, after the Soviet army withdrew, a fratricidal war began in the Northeast. The newspaper pointed out: The United States has also joined this war. Chinese troops are using American ships, American cannons, and other weapons to slaughter the Chinese people. American ships are also transporting Chinese troops trained by Americans to various war zones. The newspaper continued: If the civil war in the Northeast does not stop immediately, it will have serious consequences and could turn into a nationwide civil war. The newspaper believes that only those who are short-sighted and simple-minded would say that the Kuomintang's reoccupation of Changchun is to save face, but the lives of the residents of the Northeast are much more important than so-called face. The newspaper concluded forcefully: We demand an unconditional cessation of the civil war.
    The *Dagong Daily* of Beiping reports: The opinions of important figures in Shenyang and Jinzhou are that the Northeast issue must be resolved through political means, and it is impossible to resolve these issues through military force. Many American and Chinese newspapers have pointed out that the renewed outbreak of civil war in China is not limited to Manchuria. The American magazine *Newsweek* wrote on May 5th: After the signing of the truce agreement, the Kuomintang again launched attacks against the Communist army in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border region. From January 10th to April 23rd, the Kuomintang launched 225 attacks in this region and is now intensifying its attacks. New York Post correspondent Barkan, stationed in the Liberated Areas, wrote: The New Fourth Army stationed in this area had intended to transfer to the Communist northern area, but the local residents pleaded with the New Fourth Army to stay until China had peace guarantees and residents could freely establish administrative organs before withdrawing.

　　国民党军猛攻廿三天未逞
    民主联军坚守四平街
    中美报纸责国民党挑动内战
    【新华社四平街十一日电】东北民主联军英勇保卫四平街，现已推入第二十三天，此一坚强民主堡垒，经国民党军集中七个师长久猛攻及空中轰炸，依然屹立未动。现在国民党军进攻四平街之兵力，计有新一军之三十八师、三十师、五十师，七十一军之七十七师，九十一师，六十军之一八二师，五十二军之一九五师等十个师，以每小时一千八百发炮弹的炽烈火力，对四平街集中轰击，但我民主联军始终坚守阵地。四平街老百姓充满信心地说：“国民党看见城，但进不来。”
    【新华社东北十日电】本溪方面，战事仍在太子河南继续进行中。本溪之旧城在太子河畔北面，其新城（宫原）在河南，全市南北长约二十里。五十二军及新六军第二十二师占领本溪旧城后，现沿安沈铁路及其西侧南犯新城，新六军第十四师主力结集在本溪西南之孤家子、大安平、汤河沿一线，向本溪新城南二十里终头车站方向进攻，我军正在本溪新城一带坚持抵抗。曾参加本溪战争之七十一军八十八师，闻已于日前北运开原一带。四平街方面，激战仍在继续中。
    【新华社延安十日电】莫斯科今日广播：最近美国及中国的许多报纸及无线电，对中国现状纷纷发表评论，一致指出中国内战重新加剧的事实，并要求无条件停止内战。四月三十日纽约无线电广播：根据中国政府方面消息，说与共产党之停战协定已延迟，因为国民党军队正企图在满洲尽量多占些城市。美联社驻南京记者罗约翰五月二日电称：满洲又发生军事行动，这一军事行动，是国民党右派所挑起的，他们打算在巧妙的宣传与各种造谣掩蔽之下，造成一种有利的印象。罗约翰指出：这类宣传是荒谬无稽的。并称：蒋介石如果废除秘密警察手段，在满洲实现政协决议，则可以恢复协调一致。美每周新闻五月一日发表不久前自满洲返回旅社的记者什斯克林的论文，叙述他在本溪湖与被共产党军所俘获之国民党兵士谈话，国民党士兵都一致声明，他们不愿意进行反对自己同胞的战争。他们说：他们是在不久前乘美舰调到满洲来的，官长对他们说是调来解除日军武装，可是后来遇到自前线回来的伤兵，才知道是被调来打内战。上海文化日报五月三日写道：不幸在苏军抛退后，东北开始了自相惨杀的战争。该报指出：美国也加入了这一战争，中国军队乘美舰、使用美国大炮及其他武器屠杀中国人民，美舰并载运由美人训练的中国军队到各战区去。该报继指出：如果东北内战不立即停止，则将造成严重恶果，可以变成全国范围的内战。该报认为只有毫无远见和头脑简单的人，才会说国民党重新占领长春是保全自己的面子，可是东北居民的生活是比所谓面子更重要的多啦。该报结语力称：我们要求无条件停止内战。
    大公报北平讯：沈阳、锦州东北要人的意见，均认为东北问题必须用政治方法解决，用武力解决这些问题，是不可能的。美国与中国的许多报纸，都指出中国重新发生内战，不仅限于满洲一地。美中国每周新闻五月五日写道：签订停战协定以后，国民党又重在鄂豫皖边区向中共军进攻，一月十日至四月二十三日，国民党对这一区域进攻了二二五次，现时正在加紧进攻中。纽约邮报驻解放区记者巴尔坎写道：驻在这一区域的新四军，曾想转过至共产党北方区域去，可是当地居民恳求新四军留下，等到中国有了和平保障，居民有可能自由建立行政机关时才撤走。
