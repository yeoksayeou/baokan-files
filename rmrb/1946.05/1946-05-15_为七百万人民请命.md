　　Appealing for Seven Million People
    Li Zhuang
            I. Destruction and Rebirth
    On April 9th, five jeeps carrying the Yellow River Survey Team departed from Heze, heading northeast along the old course of the Yellow River. The jeeps flew small flags with the words "Yellow River" written on them.
    "The Yellow River is coming back!" The people of Puyang County dreamed of the overwhelming Yellow River waters returning. Fear gripped millions of residents along the river.
    This year, the Kuomintang proposed "Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course." Because the Liberated Areas considered this a major issue concerning the lives of millions, they immediately sent their representatives to negotiate with the Kuomintang. After the Kaifeng meeting, representatives from the three parties formed a joint survey team to investigate the old course of the Yellow River, to determine the construction plan for the closing and the relief measures.
    The jeeps drove by, carrying mysterious news. People saw the Kuomintang representatives in their suits and ties, and they were even more astonished. They knew that these were the people who had been in charge of "governing the Yellow River" in the past, embezzling funds and causing the Yellow River to breach its banks frequently. Their arrival would only bring more misfortune. However, they also saw their own representatives—Cao Xinzhai, Director of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office, and Sun Mingfu, among others—and they felt relieved. They petitioned, they pleaded, hoping that the representatives would see this crucial issue concerning the lives of seven million people in nearly thirty counties, to first restore the dikes and dredge the river, then close the breach and release the water, and at the same time provide effective relief to the affected people. They knew that the Kuomintang representatives could not be trusted, so they demanded that their own representatives must be included in the river management organization.
    A week of surveying gave the impression of destruction and rebirth.
    The two thousand li of river dikes were completely fragmented. In many places, they had been dug into blockade ditches by the enemy and puppet troops, and in many places, they had been converted into farmland by farmers. Coupled with wind and rain, many sections of the dikes had disappeared without a trace. Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, also said: "Thirty percent of the dikes need to be completely rebuilt."
    Without actually seeing the old course of the Yellow River, it is difficult to imagine how terrible it is. Due to the destruction of the dikes, many sections of the riverbed are one zhang two to two zhang higher than the ground. These so-called "suspended rivers" are all the result of past rulers only treating the symptoms and not the root causes, focusing solely on "building high walls." Most of the protective stone dams have collapsed, and on the sandy riverbed stand frightening silt滩 after silt滩.... Such a large project cannot be completed in a short period. Within the Jilu Yu Liberated Area, the river stretches for a total of 1,426 li. If it is completely repaired, at least 35 million cubic meters of earthwork will be needed, requiring 23.3 million man-days—a terrifying number!
    However, a trip along the old course of the Yellow River can also show the greatness of the democratic government and the strength of the masses. Since this area became a Liberated Area, people who had fled due to past floods have returned. Under the leadership and support of the democratic government, they reclaimed wasteland, planted trees, and rebuilt their homes. Now, the vast river滩 are dotted with patches of lush green wheat fields, and in the middle of the wheat fields are villages surrounded by willow trees. The streets are tidy, and the houses are spacious, obviously built according to a plan.
    In the past, Dongping Prefecture suffered from the Yellow River, and it was said that "nine out of ten years were bad harvests." Since the Yellow River changed its course and this area became a Liberated Area, those terrible things have completely become a thing of the past. The Jilu Yu Administrative Office spent 180,000 yuan specifically on managing the lake. Three hundred qing of barren lake land has been turned into fertile fields, yielding 300 jin of wheat per mu. Dongping Lake is connected to the Grand Canal, and the Grand Canal is connected to the Yellow River. If the Yellow River returns, these lake lands will all be turned into nothing.
    The area northeast of Lijin near the sea used to be entirely barren, covered with brambles, unable to grow any crops. Rabbits ran everywhere in the fields. After the War of Resistance, this also became a Liberated Area. People from Shouguang, Anqiu... came to reclaim the wasteland. The government issued 2.6 million yuan in wasteland reclamation loans. People cut through thorns and brambles, planting while fighting against the invading enemy. A new life was established, and the population increased from 50,000 to 300,000, with three-sevenths of the population living above the level of middle peasants. There were no dikes here originally. After the Yellow River returns to its old course, the floods will inevitably overflow, and these people who have shed blood and sweat and contributed to the country will face the misfortune of displacement.
    The impact of "Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course" is too great. In just Yuncheng, Juan, Pu, Shou, Fan, and Kun six counties, 856 villages will be submerged underwater, and more than 379,000 people will lose their lives and homes.
            II. Natural Disaster? Man-made Calamity?
    After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the open secret of the Yellow River breaching its banks at Huayuankou in Zhongmu in 1938 was revealed. It was originally ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to be dug by Ma Hongda. It is not surprising that the heroes who insisted on one-party dictatorship often lost battles. The problem is that these people never repent, but instead wager on the lives and property of the people. As a result, the surging Yellow River flowed thousands of li, and sixteen counties in eastern Henan, including Zhongmu, Weishi, and northern Anhui, including Taihe and Tangyin, were submerged. More than 300,000 people died unnaturally, and six million people lost their homes. The man-made disaster was equivalent to wiping out a Belgium, or exterminating a Luxembourg.
    The Yellow River has always been known for its hundreds of harms, as recorded in historical records. Over the generations, governing the Yellow River has baffled many water conservancy experts. Although there are many reasons, the most important is that this natural disaster has always been combined with man-made disasters, and the two are both causes and effects of each other. From the second year of the Republic of China to the twenty-third year, the Yellow River breached its banks twelve times within the current Jilu Yu Liberated Area, and the number of breaches increased proportionally each year. Governing the Yellow River was regarded as a way to get rich, cutting corners and being perfunctory. If the Yellow River did not breach, it would be against "natural principles." The reason why the masses along the river insisted that the river management organization must have representatives from the Liberated Areas is this. From 1938 to 1945, the breach index increased even more dramatically, with nine breaches in eight years, each with several breaches). And they were all dug by the Kuomintang.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries would say: "I breached the Yellow River in 1938 to stop the enemy and defend the Central Plains." Whether the Central Plains was defended because of this has been proven by the facts in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and we will not discuss it here. We will only say that the purpose of the subsequent breaches was entirely to submerge the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the simple people in eastern Henan who insisted on resisting Japan. For example:
    In 1940, Ruan Chuang's troops of the Kuomintang Pan-East Guerrilla Detachment breached two places in Guocun, Xihua, with the aim of submerging our Twelfth Military Sub-district's Huaitai West troops.
    In 1943, the Kuomintang launched a large-scale "suppression" of the New Fourth Army in eastern Henan. Because the New Fourth Army had the support of the masses and could not be suppressed, Liang Hualong of the Third Brigade of the Twelfth Special Commissioner's Office of Henan dug thirteen breaches in Gutong, Liukou, and other places, attempting to bring our military and civilians resisting Japan to the same end.
    In 1944, Zhang Gongda of the Kuomintang Pan-East Advance Army dug the Lingkou in Fugou, completely submerging the fields that had been sown by the people of eastern Henan and our army, attempting to starve us to death.
    On September 4, 1945, Cao Shi's troops of the Kuomintang Pan-East Advance Army dug the Shuibokou, and the surging Yellow River surged towards our counter-attacking army. At this time, we had liberated Fugou and were advancing towards Yanling (the puppet troops lived in Yanling City). The flood blocked our army's advance.
    On September 25, 1945, Ma Huaicheng, the independent detachment of the Kuomintang Pan-East "Communist Suppression," breached the Qingheyi dike east of Xihua. At this time, our army was preparing to recover Taikang, and the flood created a blocked area, adding many difficulties to our army.
    The losses caused by these breaches to the military and civilians resisting Japan in eastern Henan will probably never be calculated. The purpose of the Kuomintang's "Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course" this time is to separate the Liberated Areas of Shandong, eastern Henan, central Jiangsu, and northern Jiangsu from North China. It is part of the Kuomintang's overall conspiracy for civil war.
            III. The Focus of the Problem
    The democratic government of the Liberated Areas and the vast majority of the people know what "Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course" will bring them. But they did not oppose "Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course."
    Understanding the suffering of the people in the Yellow River flood area, they silently bore the heavy burden of "Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course." The question is how to "return."
    On April 15, representatives from the Kuomintang, the Liberated Areas, and the United States reached an agreement in Heze, stipulating that the river should be dredged and the dikes repaired first, and then the breach should be closed and the water released; the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission should submit a request to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to effectively provide relief to the affected people along the river, giving each person 100,000 yuan (legal tender) for relocation expenses, and the river management organization should be jointly composed of representatives from the Kuomintang and the Liberated Areas.
    However, the ink on the Heze agreement was not yet dry when the Kuomintang tore up the agreement. Perhaps it never intended to implement it when it made this agreement. Its propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, said: "The dike restoration work has been agreed upon with the Communists and can be completed simultaneously with the Huayuankou closing work within two months." This is a blatant lie. Anyone with clear eyes can see that not only has the two sides not "agreed" to this, but such a huge dredging and dike restoration project cannot be completed this year at all. The Central News Agency has always slandered the Liberated Areas. At this time, it said: "The people in the CCP area are organized and have huge manpower and material resources," but "obstruct the progress of the river project." This is clearly an attempt to find an excuse for releasing the river water.
    Zhao Mingfu, the representative of the Liberated Areas, saw this situation and personally went to Huayuankou, and also met with the Kuomintang representatives to discuss and agree that the riverbed should be measured first in the lower reaches of the old course before the wheat harvest, and the river should be dredged and ditches cut in the autumn, the dangerous works should be repaired in the spring of next year, and then the breach should be closed and the water released. However, the Kuomintang, which is accustomed to going back on its word, immediately changed its mind again. It stubbornly insisted that the entire project must be completed within two months.
    Rather than saying that the Kuomintang never cares about the lives and deaths of the people, it is better to say that its every move is intentionally putting the people to death. Although the dike restoration and dredging project of the old course is far from completion, the closing project of Huayuankou is almost complete. This 1,600-meter breach has been "rushed" from both sides continuously, leaving only 600 meters in the middle that has not yet been closed. Since the Republic of China, every Yellow River breach has always been closed in a year of good harvest, and some have even been delayed until the third year. At that time, the Kuomintang acted slowly, but this time it is particularly active. They brought in cars, built railways, brutally whipped the forced laborers, and endlessly requisitioned various materials. The purpose is to release the water as soon as possible, turning the Liberated Areas along the river into a watery country.
    The day of the Huayuankou closure is almost the time of the great flood. The overwhelming Yellow River water will flow horizontally, and millions of lives will be thrown onto the line of death.
    Faced with this great conspiracy, another "Belgium" will be destroyed.
    People of the whole country, be vigilant and save these seven million compatriots who are about to be destroyed!
    The people of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, mobilize and insist on thoroughly implementing the Heze agreement, and use your own strength to safeguard your own lives!

### 为七百万人民请命

　　为七百万人民请命
    李庄
            一、毁灭与新生
    四月九日，五辆吉普车载着黄河勘察团从荷泽出发，沿着黄河故道，由西南向东北驶去。车上插着写有“黄河”两字的小旗。
    “黄河要回来了！”濮县的老百姓作梦都遇到重新袭来的滔天黄水。恐惧袭击着沿河几百万居民。
    今年一年里国民党就提出“黄河归故”。解放区因为这是个关系几百万人命的大事情，马上派遣自己的代表和国民党磋商，开封会议之后，由三方代表合组勘察团，赴黄河故道勘察，以决定施工合龙计划，和救济的办法。
    吉普车带着神秘的消息驶过来。人们看见西装革履的国民党代表，他们更加惊愕了。他们知道这些人就是过去负责“治黄”，贪污中饱而使黄河经常决口的人。他们的到来，只会给自己增加更多的不幸。但是，他们又看到了自己的代表——冀鲁豫行署曹心斋主任及孙明甫等，于是他们安心了。他们请愿、他们哭诉，希望代表们能够看到这个近三十县七百万人生死攸关的大问题，先复堤浚河，再合龙放水，同时切实救济被害的人民。他们知道国民党代表靠不住，因此，他们要求治河机构中一定要有自己的代表。
    一周的勘察，给人的印象是毁灭和新生。
    两千里的河堤，已经完全支离破碎了，许多地方被敌伪挖成了封锁沟，许多地方被农民改成了耕地。再加上风吹雨打，使许多段河堤连痕迹都没有了。黄河水利委员会委员长赵守钰也说：“百分之三十的堤坝须要完全重新修补。”
    不真去看看黄河故道，很难想像它的可怕。由于堤坝的破坏，许多段河身高出地面一丈二到两丈，这种俗语所说的“悬河”，全是过去统治者只治标、不治本，徒斤斤于“九仞之城”的结果。防险的石坝大多已经坍塌，在积沙的河身上，矗立着一座座骇人的淤滩……。这样大的工程，短期内是绝对不能完成的。在冀鲁豫解放区内的河身共长一四二六里，如果完全修好，至少须筑三千五百万土方，用人工二千三百三十万个——怕人的数字！
    但是，沿着黄河故道走一遭，就同时能够看到民主政府和群众力量的伟大。自从这里成了解放区，过去因洪水泛滥而逃亡在外的人们都回来了。他们在民主政府领导与扶值下，垦荒植树，重新建立自己的家园。现在广袤的河滩里，点缀起一片片油绿的麦田，麦田中间是被杨柳树拱围着的村庄，街道整齐、房屋宽敞，显然是有计划的建造起来的。
    东平州过去黄水为患，语称“十年九不收。”自从黄河改道，这里建立了解放区以后，那种怕人的事情完全成为过去了。冀鲁豫行署曾以十八万元专门治湖。三百顷瘠硗的湖地变为良田，每亩可收获三百斤麦子。东平湖与运河相连，运河又与黄河相通，如果黄河重来，这些湖地都将化为乌有。
    利津东北近海的地方曾经全为荒区，荆条遍地，五谷不生，田野里到处奔驰着兔子，抗战后这里也成了解放区，寿光、安邱……的人纷纷赶来垦荒。政府发放了二百六十万元垦荒贷款。人们披荆斩棘，一面垦植，一面和进攻的敌人打仗。新生活建立起来了，人口由五万增至三十万，七分之三的人口过着中农以上的生活。这里原先就没有堤坝，黄河归故之后，必致洪流漫流，这些流血流汗、功在国家的人民，又要遭逢流离失所的厄运。
    “黄河归故”的影响太大了，仅郓、鄄、濮、寿、范、昆六县，就将有八百五十六个村庄陆沉水底，三十七万九千多人口，要失掉生命和家园。
            二、天灾？人祸？
    抗战胜利之后，三八年黄河在中牟花园口溃决的公开秘密揭破了。原是蒋介石命令马鸿达掘开的。坚持一党专政的英雄们常打败仗原无足奇，问题在于这些人们永远不自悔悟，却以人民的生命财产作赌注。以至滚滚黄河一泻千里，豫东的中牟、尉氏及皖北的太和、汤阴等十六县随之陆沉。三十多万人死于非命，六百万人失掉了家园。人为的灾害等于消灭了一个比利时，死绝了一个卢森堡。
    黄河百害，早经载诸史籍。历代治黄，不知难倒了多少水利专家。其中原因虽多，但最重要的一项，是这种天灾始终与人祸相结合，二者并互为因果。从民国二年至二十三年，黄河在现冀鲁豫解放区范围内决口达十二次，决口次数且在按比例逐年增加。治黄被视作发财之道，偷工减料，苟且敷衍，黄河不决，是无“天理”。沿河群众坚持治河机构一定要有解放区代表参加，就是这个缘故。从三八年到四五年，决口指数更是飞跃增加，八年中竟有九次，每次均决口数处）。而且都是国民党掘开的。
    国民党反动派会说：“我在三八年决开黄河，是为了阻止敌人，保卫中原。”中原是否因此保卫住了，已为抗战中的事实所证明，这里不去说它，只说以后的几次，其目的竟是完全为了淹没豫东坚持抗战的八路军、新四军和淳朴的人民。例如：
    四○年，国民党泛东游击支队阮创部在西华郭村决口两处，目的在淹没我十二分区淮太西部队。
    四三年，国民党在豫东大“剿”新四军，因为新四军有群众拥护，剿不了，于是国民党河南十二专署第三大队梁化龙就在古铜、刘口等地决口十三处，企图使我抗战军民同归于尽。
    四四年，国民党泛东挺进军张公达掘开扶沟陵口，把豫东人民及我军已播种的田地完全淹没，企图把我们饿死。
    四五年九月四日，国民党泛东挺进军曹世部掘开水波口，滚滚黄河向我反攻大军汹涌而来，这时我已解放扶沟，正向鄢陵挺进（鄢陵城内住的是伪军）。被洪水阻绝了我军的进路。
    四五年九月二十五日，国民党泛东“剿共”独立支队马淮诚决开西华以东清河驿堤，这时我军正布置收复太康，洪水造成一片阻绝地带，给我军增加了许多困难。
    这些决口给予豫东抗战军民的损失，恐怕永远也算不清的。这次国民党要“黄河归故”的目的，是在把山东、豫东、苏中、苏北等解放区与华北分割开来，是国民党全面内战阴谋的一部分。
            三、问题的焦点
    解放区民主政府和广大人民深知“黄河归故”将带给他们什么。但是他们并没有反对“黄河归故”。
    体念黄泛区人民的痛苦，他们默默无言的承受了“黄河归故”这副沉重的担子。问题在于怎么个“归”法。
    四月十五日，国民党、解放区及美方代表在荷泽成立了协议，规定先浚河修堤、后合龙放水；由黄委会呈请联总行总切实救济沿河难胞，每人发给十万元（法币）迁移费，治河机构由国民党、解放区双方代表共同组成。
    但是，荷泽协议墨迹未干，国民党就撕毁了这一协定。也许，在订定这个协议时它就没有准备实行。它的宣传机关中央社说：“复堤工作已与共方商定，可于两月内配合花园口堵口工作同时完成。”这是瞪着眼睛造谣，明眼人一看便知，不但双方并未这么“商定”，而且像这样浩大的浚河复堤工作，本年内根本不能完成。中央社是一贯诬蔑解放区的，在这时候它却说：“中共区民众有组织，有庞大的人力物力”，但是“阻挠河工之进行。”这显然是企图率甚河水的借口。
    解放区代表赵明甫氏看到这种情形，特亲自到花园口跑了一遭，又和国民党代表会谈，商定故道下游于麦收前先测量河床，秋后浚河并裁沟取道，明春修理险工，最后再合龙放水。但是，惯于自食其言的国民党马上又变了卦，它顽固的坚持要在两个月内全部完工。
    与其说国民党从来不管人民的死活，无宁说它的一举一动，都是有意制人民于死命。故道的复堤浚河工程虽离完成尚远，但花园口的堵口工程却已差不多了。这个一千六百公尺的决口，连续从两边“抢修”，中间只剩了六百公尺尚未合龙。民国以来历次黄河决口，总是丰年合龙，甚至有迟至第三年者。那时候国民党迟迟其行，这次却特别积极了。它们调来汽车，修了铁路，残酷的鞭打着强拉来的民夫，无限止的强征各种材料。为的是尽早放过水来，使沿河的解放区变成泽国。
    花园口合龙之日，差不多正是大泛之时，滔天的黄水就要横流过来，几百万条生命将要被抛到到死亡线上。
    面临着这个天大的阴谋，又一个“比利时”将被毁灭了。
    全国人民警惕起来，拯救这七百万将被毁灭的同胞！
    河南、河北、山东的人民动员起来，坚持彻底实现荷泽协议，用自己的力量维护自己的生命！
