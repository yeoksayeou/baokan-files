　　Remarkable Achievements of the National Front Government
    Czechoslovak People Hold General Election
    Implementing Pro-Soviet Policy and Cooperation with Democratic Countries, Large Enterprises Nationalized
    750,000 Farmers Receive Land, Domestic National Unity Consolidated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Prague dispatch: Today, the Czechoslovak people held their first democratic general election since 1935, electing 300 members of the new parliament to draft a new constitution and elect a president. All Czechoslovak citizens aged 18 and above participated in this election; in Czechoslovak history, women and active-duty soldiers have also obtained the right to vote for the first time today. Since the Red Army liberated Czechoslovakia, the National Front government, composed of four Czechoslovak parties (the Communist Party, the Catholic People's Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Socialist Party) and two Slovak parties (the Communist Party and the Democratic Party), has achieved remarkable results in its governance: First, it has established a foreign policy of being pro-Soviet and maintaining good neighborly friendship and cooperation with all democratic countries. Second, it has implemented important economic policies on domestic issues, first and foremost the nationalization of major industrial sectors, banks, and trust companies, severely undermining the foundation of imperialism and fascism—monopoly capital. Czechoslovakia now has 10,000 nationalized enterprises, employing 60 percent of the country's workers and staff. The machine tool and electrical appliance industries transferred to state control account for 84 percent of the country, employing 400,000 workers. Second, as a result of land reform, 1.1 million hectares of land have been distributed to 750,000 landless or land-poor farmers out of the 1.5 million hectares of land and 1 million hectares of forest land confiscated by the state. Third, it has correctly resolved the national equality relationship between Czechs and Slovaks within Czechoslovakia, consolidating domestic national unity. The National Front government has also achieved practical results in reforming fiscal revenue and expenditure and restoring the national economy. In order to enable the people of the whole country to express their opinions more freely in this election, the National Front also adopted "blank votes" to allow all right-wing parties and people who did not participate in the government to write out their dissatisfaction. Undoubtedly, the Czechoslovak people will express their enthusiasm for supporting the National Front in today's election, consolidate Czechoslovakia's democratic development, and crush the conspiracy of right-wing reactionaries "who, with the support of certain leaders of the Catholic People's Party and the National Socialist Party, used anti-communist and anti-Soviet slogans to split the National Front and undermine national democratic unity," which has already manifested itself in the election campaign.

　　民族阵线政府政绩卓著
    捷克人民举行大选
    实行亲苏与民主国家合作大企业已国有化
    七十五万农民分得土地国内民族团结巩固
    【新华社延安二十六日电】布拉格讯：今天捷克人民举行其自一九三五年以来第一次民主的大选，选举新国会的三百名议员，以起草新宪法，并选举总统。参加此次大选者，为一切年在十八岁以上的捷克公民；在捷克历史上，妇女与在役军人于今日亦第一次获得选举权。自红军解放捷克以来，由四个捷克政党（共产党、天主教人民党、社会民主党、与国家社会党），及两个斯洛伐克政党（共产党、与民主党）所组成之民族阵线政府，在其执政中，已卓著政绩：第一，它确定了亲苏及与一切民主国家善邻友好与合作的外交政策。第二，在国内问题上实行了重要的经济政策，首先是主要工业部门、银行、与信托公司国有化的法令，严重地打击了帝国主义与法西斯主义的基础——独占资本，现在捷克已经有了一万家国有化企业，其所雇用之工人与职员，占全国百分之六十，转入国家手中的机器工具与电气用品工业，已占全国百分之八十四，其所雇用之工人达四十万。其次，实行土地改革的结果，被国家没收的一百五十万海克脱土地及一百万海克脱森林地中，已有一百一十万海克脱土地分给了无地或少地的七十五万农民。第三，它正确地解决了捷克国内捷克人与斯洛伐克人之间的民族平等关系，巩固了国内民族的团结。至于在改革财政收支及恢复国民经济等方面，民族阵线政府也都获得了实际的成果。民族阵线为使全国人民更自由表达其意见于此次大选中，并采用“白票”，使一切未参加政府的各右翼政党及人民，写出自己的不满。无疑地，捷克人民将于今天举行的选举中，表示其拥护民族阵线的热诚，巩固捷克的民主发展，并击碎在选举运动中已显现的右派反动分子“他们得到天主教人民党与国家社会党某些领袖的支持，以反共反苏的口号分裂民族阵线，破坏国家民主团结的”阴谋。
