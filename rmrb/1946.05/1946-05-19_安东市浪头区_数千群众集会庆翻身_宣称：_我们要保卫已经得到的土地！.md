　　Andong City Langtou District
    Thousands of People Gather to Celebrate Liberation
    Declaring: "We Must Defend the Land We Have Obtained!"
    [New China News Agency Northeast, 16th dispatch] Our reporter Liu Baiyu reports: On the morning of April 18th, thousands of toiling people in the Langtou District of Andong City held a liberation celebration assembly with boundless joy. Under the auspices of the democratic government, more than 2,000 households in the district were allocated 3,800 mu of enemy and puppet land. They were about to receive land deeds at this celebration, and they were as happy as if it were their birthday, wearing new clothes and performing stilts and Yangko dances. Gao Chongmin, Chairman of Andong Province, Liu Lanbo, Vice Chairman, and the Mayor of Andong City all extended warm congratulations to the peasants and used kind words to discuss with them what to do in the future. Waves of enthusiastic slogans resounded in the sky: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Support the Democratic Government!" "Oppose the reactionaries' attack on the Northeast!" After receiving the land deeds, thousands of peasants put them into strong pockets close to their bodies, and then formed a line, carrying a huge statue of Chairman Mao in a sedan chair, and paraded with cheers. The folk music was held in the front, and they said to the people: "We have been poor for thousands of years. Now, with the help of Chairman Mao, we have been liberated. We must defend the land we have obtained!" Since the liberation of Langtou District, it has become increasingly prosperous. With government loans, more than 40 cooperatives such as shipping, fishery, tobacco, and electricity have been organized. This distribution of land seized by the enemy and puppets was carried out according to the degree of poverty. The allocation committees of each street, composed of workers, peasants, women, military representatives, and street chiefs, conducted detailed surveys, measurements, and reviews in advance, and then convened mass meetings to study and discuss, and make fair decisions. Ordinary peasants and workers were allocated eight to twelve mu of land. At the end of the meeting, the reporter saw countless peasants carrying grain and farm tools from the meeting on their backs, closely following the sedan chair. Now, the allocation committees of Langtou District have been transformed into production committees, leading the development of a large-scale production movement.

　　安东市浪头区
    数千群众集会庆翻身
    宣称：“我们要保卫已经得到的土地！”
    【新华社东北十六日电】本社记者刘白羽报导：四月十八日早晨，安东市浪头区数千劳苦人民以无比喜悦，举行庆祝翻身大会。在民主政府主持之下，余区二千多户，分了三千八百亩敌伪土地，这次将在庆祝会上，领取地照，他们好像过生日一样，穿了新衣服，闹着高跷秧歌。安东省主席高崇明、副主席刘澜波及安东市长等，都向农民致热诚的祝贺，并用亲切的言辞，和他们商量今后要做的事，一阵阵热烈的口号，震响高空：“共产党万岁！”“拥护民主政府！”“反对反动派向东北进攻！”数千农民于领到地照后，把它放进贴身的牢固的口袋里，于是排成队伍，用花轿抬着毛主席的巨像，欢呼游行。前面举着民间音乐，他们对人们说：“我们穷了几千年，现在毛主席帮助下，我们翻身了，我们要保卫已经得到的土地！”浪头区被解放以后，日趋繁荣，经过政府贷款，组织起船运、渔业、烟草、电气等合作社四十余处。这次分配敌伪强占土地，是按照穷苦情况，事先由工、农、妇女、军事代表及街长组成的各街分配委员会进行详细的调查丈量审查后，再召开群众会议研究讨论，公平决定。普通农民和工人，都分到八亩至十二亩土地。在散会时，记者看见无数农民，背负着从会上领到的粮食农具，紧跟在花轿后面。现在浪头区各分配委员会，已转为生产委员会，领导开展大生产运动。
