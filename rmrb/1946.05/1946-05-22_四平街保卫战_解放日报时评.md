　　The Battle to Defend Sipingjie
    ——*Liberation Daily* Commentary
    The battle to defend Sipingjie has lasted a full month, and the city is still being firmly defended by the Democratic Allied Army.

    Since April 16th, the Kuomintang authorities have successively used seven divisions to launch a fierce encircling attack on Sipingjie from the south, southwest, and northwest. The warmongers within the Kuomintang, relying on their American-equipped weapons, with approximately 2,000 artillery shells per hour, plus air support, were confident that they could easily seize this peaceful and democratic city, which the Northeast people had just established, from the hands of the Northeast people. However, the strong resistance of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army met them with a rebuff. In the past month, four fierce attacks (April 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 25th) have all been repelled. By early May, the front line at Sipingjie had reached a stalemate, the Kuomintang army's morale was dampened, and soldiers' war-weariness and instances of voluntarily defecting to our side began to occur.

    The battle to defend Sipingjie demonstrated the strength of the Democratic Allied Army's self-defense capabilities. The Democratic Allied Army is resolutely fighting to defend peace, democracy, and the interests of the Northeast people. They have gained the support of the broad masses of the Northeast people, and they have also received the sympathy of the people and democrats throughout the country. Anyone who wants to eliminate them by force will not succeed. However, the Kuomintang warmongers are not giving up their ambitions. They continue to expand the civil war in the Northeast, continue to reinforce and attack Sipingjie. Currently, Liao Yaoxiang, commander of the New Sixth Army, is personally leading the front-line troops in the attack, and Zheng Dongguo, deputy commander of the security forces, and Liang Huasheng are also personally directing the battle on the front lines. From the 14th, the fierce fighting on the front lines intensified again. From the 18th, the Kuomintang army began to use tanks. In the past few days, although the Kuomintang army has been under the cover of airplanes and tanks, they have still been repelled by the Democratic Allied Army and suffered heavy losses. On the 16th and 17th alone, the Kuomintang army lost over a thousand men.

    In the face of the Northeast people and the Democratic Allied Army's incomparably brave and resolute resistance, the Kuomintang warmongers still recklessly waste the lives of a large number of innocent officers and soldiers, expand their attacks on the Northeast people, and provoke attacks on the liberated areas in various parts of Guannei in order to cooperate with the civil war in the Northeast, thereby undermining national peace. This is because these warmongers place their hopes on continued assistance from the US military (equipment, training, transportation, etc.). The warmongers are also trying to use this assistance to gradually drag the United States into the quagmire of the Chinese civil war. It is undeniable that American assistance is one of the important factors in the continued expansion of the civil war in the Northeast today, and this assistance is contrary to the peaceful wishes of the American people. The US authorities should immediately stop all this assistance, especially immediately stop helping the Kuomintang army transport troops and equipment, in order to promote peace in China and enhance the friendship between the Chinese and American people.

　　四平街保卫战
    ——解放日报时评
    保卫四平街之战，已整整过了一个月，该城现在仍在民主联军坚守中。
    从上月十六日起，国民党当局先后以七个师的兵力，从南面、西南、西北三方面向四平街军进行了猛烈的包围进攻，国民党内好战分子倚恃着他们的美械装备，每小时二千发左右的炮弹，加上飞机助战，满以为很容易从东北人民的手里夺取他们刚刚建立起来的这一座和平民主的城市。但东北民主联军的坚强抵抗，使他们碰了壁。一月以来，四次猛烈的进攻（四月二十一、二十二、二十三及二十五日），都被打退。至五月上旬，四平街前线陷于胶着状态，国民党军队的锐气受到了挫折，士兵厌战的情绪和自动向我投诚的事件，开始发生。
    四平街保卫战，表现了民主联军自卫力量的强大，民主联军坚决为着保卫和平民主及东北人民利益而战。他们得到了广大东北人民的拥护，也得到了全国人民及民主人士的同情，任何人要想用武力消灭他们，是做不到的。但是，国民党好战分子野心不死，仍然坚持扩大东北内战，继续向四平街增援进攻，现新六军军长廖耀湘，正在自率第一线部队攻击，保安副司令郑洞国及梁华盛，亦亲临前线指挥。十四日起，前线激战又趋猛烈。十八日起，国民党军开始使用坦克。几天以来，国民党军虽在飞机、坦克掩护之下，但仍被民主联军击退，并遭受重大损失，十六、十七两日，国民党军损失上千。
    国民党内好战分子在东北人民与民主联军的英勇无比的坚决抵抗前面，仍然不惜枉费大量的无辜官兵的生命，向东北人民扩大进攻，并在关内各地向解放区挑衅进攻，以配合东北内战，从而破坏全国的和平，这是因为这些好战分子把希望寄托在美军方面的继续帮助（装备、训练、运输等等）上面，好战分子并力图利用这种援助，把美国一步一步地拉进中国内战的泥坑中。不可否认的，美国的帮助是今天东北内战继续扩大的重要因素之一，而这种帮助是与美国人民的和平愿望相违反的，美国当局应当立即停止这一切帮助，特别是立即停止帮助国民党军运兵运械，以便促进中国的和平，增进中美人民的友谊。
