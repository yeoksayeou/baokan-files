　　Yongnian Group Departs Handan for Yongnian
    Restoring Transportation and Providing Relief to Residents Inside the City
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 16th] The Yongnian Executive Group, including U.S. representative Lieutenant Colonel Olson, government representative Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng, and CCP representative Colonel Zhao Haifeng, along with over ten others, departed Handan for Yongnian on the 15th. It is understood that the mission of this group is to organize a relief committee and restore transportation within the city, allowing people to move freely and conduct trade. Currently, the puppet troops garrisoning Yongnian City are actively building fortifications in preparation for war. The main reason why relief efforts in Yongnian City have not been smooth in recent months is due to the obstruction by the puppet troops. Comrade Zhao Wei, our representative participating in the UNRRA relief efforts, was monitored and insulted by the puppet troops in Yongnian City and unable to carry out his work. Whether this group's mission will be effective depends fundamentally on the disbandment of the puppet troops. Furthermore, it is reported that UNRRA inspection commissioner Guo Landun has also gone to Yongnian.

　　永年小组离邯赴永
    恢复交通救济城内居民
    【新华社邯郸十六日电】永年执行小组美方代表奥尔森中校，政府代表张朝正中校，中共代表赵海枫上校等一行十余人，于十五日由邯郸前往永年，据悉该小组此行任务为组织救济委员会，恢复城内的交通，使人民自由来往进行贸易。目下据守永年城的伪军，正在积极构筑工事，准备战争。几月来对永年城内救济工作不能顺利进行，主要由于伪军多方阻挠，我方参加联总救济工作之代表赵为一同志，曾在永年城内受到伪军之监视与污辱，不能进行工作。该小组此行任务能否收效，基本问题仍在于解散伪军。又息：联总视察专员郭兰敦亦同赴永年。
