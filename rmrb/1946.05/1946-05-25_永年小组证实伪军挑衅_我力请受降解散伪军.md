　　[Dispatch from our newspaper in Handan, 21st] On the 16th, puppet troops inside Yongnian city violated the ceasefire agreement by opening fire and wounding our comrade, Platoon Leader Chen Fu, causing immense indignation among the military and civilians outside Yongnian city. It is generally believed that the provocative behavior of these puppet troops has become even more疯狂嚣张 since the American and KMT representatives of the Yongnian Executive Team entered Yongnian city. To understand the truth of the matter, this reporter visited places like Nanqiao Town and Xida Dike, and interviewed relevant personnel. The facts are as follows: Since the KMT and American representatives entered Yongnian city, the puppet troops inside the city began firing at our military and civilians outside the Xiguan gate from the third artillery position inside the west gate starting on the morning of the 16th, firing over a hundred rounds. Comrade Chen Fu, platoon leader of the 1st platoon, 1st company, 1st brigade of the 3rd sub-district of Southern Hebei, was inspecting local fisherman from a wooden boat on the embankment outside Xiguan. He was shot in the left leg by the puppet troops, the bullet passing straight through, and was seriously wounded. He was immediately sent to the rear hospital of the 3rd sub-district for treatment. Our side protested the above-mentioned provocative behavior of the puppet troops to the team. After receiving the letter, American representative Lt. Col. Olson, accompanied by KMT representative Lt. Col. Zhang Chaozheng, came to Tanxiapo on the afternoon of the 17th and, together with our representative, Col. Zhao Haifeng, went to the scene of the incident at Xida Dike to conduct an investigation and listen to the report by Political Commissar Tian and Company Commander Qin Jiuru of the garrison troops on the incident of the puppet troops' provocation and shooting, as well as the injury of Platoon Leader Chen Fu.
    On the 19th, in order to further understand the truth of the Xida Dike incident, the KMT and American representatives, accompanied by our representative, went to our rear hospital in Laoying Village to investigate. American representative Olson personally examined Platoon Leader Chen Fu's wound and inquired in detail about the circumstances of Platoon Leader Chen's injury. He believed that there was no doubt that it was the puppet troops who had inflicted the wound. After examining the wound of Platoon Leader Chen, who was groaning in pain on the hospital bed and was seriously injured, KMT representative Lt. Col. Zhang Chaozheng still made unreasonable excuses, attempting to evade responsibility for the shooting. Our representative firmly stated that the arrogant behavior of the puppet troops in violating the ceasefire agreement should be severely punished, and requested the team to report to the Peiping Executive Headquarters and immediately order the Communist troops to accept the surrender of the puppet troops in the city and dissolve them.

　　永年小组证实伪军挑衅
    我力请受降解散伪军
    【本报邯郸二十一日讯】十六日永年城内伪军违犯停战协定开枪打伤我方排长陈辅同志，引起永年城外军民万分愤恨，咸认伪军此种挑衅行为，自永年执行小组美方与国方代表进入永年城后，益加疯狂嚣张。记者为了解此事发生真象，当至南桥镇及西大堤等地视察，并访问有关人员，据悉事实经过如下：自国美两方代表进入永年城后，城内伪军从十六日上午起即在西门内第三炮台处向西关外我方军民开枪射击，连发百余弹，冀南三分区一大队一中队一排排长陈辅同志适在西关外大堤木船上参观老百姓捕鱼。遭伪军射中左腿，贯穿一洞，负伤甚重，当即送入三分区后方医院救治。我方当将上述伪军挑衅行为，向小组提出抗议，美代表奥尔森中校接信后，于十七日下午偕国方代表张朝正中校，来滩下坡，会同我方代表赵海枫上校前往西大堤出事地点进行调查，并听取驻军田政委与秦九如连长报告伪军挑衅打枪经过及排长陈辅同志受伤情形。
    十九日，小组为进一步了解西大堤事件真象，国美双方代表在我方代表陪同下，前往老营村我后方医院调查，美代表奥尔森亲验陈辅排长之伤口，对陈排长受伤经过询问颇详。认为确系伪军打伤无疑，国方代表张朝正中校检验我呻吟病床身负重伤之陈排长伤口后，仍无理狡辩，企图推诿打枪责任，我代表坚称伪军此种违犯停战协定之狂妄行为，应予严厉制裁，要求小组报告北平执行部允即下令中共部队受降并解散城内伪军。
