　　Today's "Congtai"
    A Record of the Mobile Clinic of the Border Region Health Bureau
    Zhan Chao

    The "Congtai" in the northeast corner of Handan's urban and rural area is said to be the site of Zhao Wuling King's palace during the Warring States period. For these few small mounds and pavilions, countless literati and scholars have expended their ink, and countless common people have exhausted their blood and sweat. After the Japanese occupied Handan, the pseudo-county magistrate Yang Shuji was even more "elegant" and vigorously carried out construction, expanding and renovating it into "Congtai Park." It is said that the old people in the four suburbs of the city had to bear five or six months of labor service for this, and the fat and money squeezed from them were countless. In the end, apart from a few "Yamato" descendants and their lackeys wandering around "Congtai", ordinary people did not dare to visit. But today's "Congtai" has completely changed. It is not only a good farming place, but also a sacred place for saving lives, because it is home to the Border Region Health Bureau, which is in charge of the health affairs of 30 million people, and its affiliated mobile clinic, which directly serves the people of Handan.

    The Health Bureau's mobile clinic has been in Handan "Congtai" for less than two months, but it has left many good stories among the masses. There was a carpenter named Hu Xiang in Beimenli who suddenly became seriously ill in March and almost died. His family was very poor, and his elderly mother cried all day. When the doctor from the mobile clinic learned about this, he took the initiative to go to his door and treat him for more than a month without pay. The carpenter is now not only able to eat and walk, but also able to do some light work. Another oil mill worker's wife had her "yangshui" (amniotic sac) broken for a whole day and night and still couldn't give birth. The pregnant woman and her family were extremely anxious, but they had no way to deal with it. Later, they heard that the public had a mobile clinic, so they quickly sent someone to "Congtai" for help. As a result, they received a satisfactory answer. Doctor Zhao rushed over overnight, and until late at night, Health Bureau Director Zhu and Section Chief Liu, upon hearing that it was indeed a difficult delivery, braved the heavy snow from "Congtai" to Xibei Nan Zhuang (it was the night of the heaviest snowfall in March) until the pregnant woman safely gave birth before leaving. Afterwards, they sent people every day to wash for the pregnant woman and baby until the pregnant woman was completely safe. Even so, the mobile clinic refused to accept any money for medicine from the worker.

    If you go to "Congtai," you will see a wooden sign at the entrance of the mobile clinic that says: "Morning Clinic from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Home Visits from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM." But you can also often see people looking for them outside of the specified time. These visitors are often patients with urgent illnesses or those who have traveled from afar. In such cases, the staff of the mobile clinic will put aside other things and treat them as quickly as possible. For example, the citizen Li Zhengyuan was tripped by a big cart, and the wheel crushed the flesh of one of his calves to pieces (fortunately, it didn't break the bone). In some places, the bone and flesh had separated. What a serious injury this was! And a lot of mud and dirt had been pressed inside. When he was carried to the mobile clinic, it was still very early, but Section Chief Liu of the Medical Administration Section did not hesitate to get out of bed and perform surgery on him. Now Li Zhengyuan still sits on a stretcher and goes to "Congtai" every day to change his dressing. Every time he goes home with even greater joy, he often says this: "With the doctors of the Eighth Route Army, my life has been saved." Indeed, at the beginning, not only Li Zhengyuan himself, but even his relatives and neighbors were worried about his leg, and even his life. But now, under the responsible treatment of the mobile clinic, his leg is growing new skin at the fastest speed.

    "Congtai" - now such a beloved place, dozens of people go there every day, occasionally including farmers who come to see a doctor from 30 or 40 miles away. It reminds people of the scene of villagers going to temple fairs. On the desk of the mobile clinic, I saw such statistics: In April, a total of 935 patients were diagnosed and treated, home visits were made four or five times, 170 people came for examinations, and medicines worth more than 10,100 yuan were provided for free treatment. It is said that this number is not yet complete. In addition, in terms of epidemic prevention, in April they cooperated with general hospitals and others to vaccinate more than 4,200 people (mostly children) in the urban and suburban areas. The number of elementary school teachers who were trained in vaccination surgery and given vaccines to take back to their schools is not included.

    At dusk, I left the Health Bureau and was about to go to the Citizen's Association in Beimenli when I met an elderly man at the door. He pointed to the Health Bureau's building and said, "Did you just come from 'Dingjia Temple'?" I nodded. Then, he enthusiastically narrated the great changes that had taken place in this short period of time. He said: That place used to be home to special agent assassination agencies. After the democratic government came, the black guns of the heartless monks, what's-his-name, Ciyun, Zhiyuan, who received enemy allowances, Guo Caiqin's (pseudo-Jinan Dao Communist Suppression Commander) and Guo Huamin's (pseudo-Self-Defense Regiment Leader) confidants, occupied people's land, and raped women were also searched out, and the occupied land was returned to the people to farm. Now it has been replaced by the Health Bureau's mobile clinic, which saves lives. It's really good, really good. After a short pause, he asked me: "I heard that they are going to build a hospital there, is that true?" I said "It's true" and relayed what Health Bureau Director Zhu had said: Chairman Yang is very concerned about this matter and has specially allocated 110,000 yuan for construction, and also said that as long as it is beneficial to the people, it is worth spending more money. I also told him that when I came, Director Zhu and the others were planning the site near "Dingjia Temple" and expected to complete it in three months. At that time, it could accommodate several times more patients than the mobile clinic. The old man was overjoyed, but then said with a sigh: "Young man, do you know who built the earthen mountain on the shore of Hou Lake?" He pointed in the direction of "Congtai" and asked me. I shook my head to indicate that I didn't know. He then continued: "That was built by Yang Zhaoji. He and the Japanese and his concubines thought in the lake-center pavilion that they should build a mountain by the lake so that they could climb up and view the scenery of the lake after boating. His thought was not important, but the people had to bear tens of thousands of workers…." Then he sighed and said: "Alas! Young man, think about it, in the past, how many times was the construction of 'Congtai' for the people?? Only now has the world changed, and everything is based on the people, which is true democracy, and the same is true for repairing 'Congtai'." After he muttered to himself for a while, he turned to me again: "Our Chairman Yang has a truly high vision, 'Congtai' is really a perfect place to recuperate!" Under the setting sun, looking into the distance at a lake with willows, I thought: Ancient "Congtai," now is the time of your rebirth.

　　今日的“丛台”
    记边区卫生局流诊所
    展潮
    邯郸城厢东北角的“丛台”，据说是战国时代赵武灵王的遗址。为了这几个小土阜和亭榭，历来不知费去多少文人雅士的笔墨，更不知耗尽了多少老百姓的血汗。日本人占领邯郸后，伪县长杨逆书基更是“雅兴”勃发，大兴土木，扩修而成“丛台公园”。听说城四郊的老百姓，为此得整整负担五六个月的劳役，被榨去的脂膏钱更是无法统计。到头来，“丛台”除了几个“大和”子孙和他的走卒们在游荡外，普通老百姓是不敢问津的。可是今日的“丛台”，一切全变了，这里不仅是个好的农作场，更是一个救人活命的圣地，因为这里住着主持三千万人民卫生事宜的边区卫生局，以及它所附属直接服务于邯郸群众的流动诊疗所。
    卫生局流诊所迁来邯郸“丛台”，才不到两个月，却在群众中留下不少的佳话。北门里有个木匠叫胡祥，三月间突然得重病，几乎死去，家里又很穷，急得他年老的母亲整天啼哭，这事被流诊所的医生知道了，自动上门，义务地替他治疗了一个多月，这个木匠现在已不仅能吃饭走动，还能作些轻微的劳作。另外一个油精厂工人，老婆“羊水”（衣包水）破后一昼一夜，还不能分娩，产妇和家人都焦急得不得了，但又毫无办法，后来听说公家有个流诊所，连忙派人去“丛台”求助，结果他们得到满意的答复，赵医生连夜赶去，而且直至深夜，卫生局朱局长和刘科长，听说确系难产，又冒着大雪从“丛台”赶到西南北庄（那是三月下雪最大的一夜），直至产妇安全地分娩后才走，过后每天还派人去替产妇与婴儿洗涤，待产妇完全安全时为止。虽然是这样，流诊所却拒绝接受这个工人的分文药费。
    你要是去“丛台”，老远便会看到流诊所门口一块木牌上的字：“上午九时至十二时门诊，下午一时至三时出诊”。可是你也常常可以看到，不断有人在规定的时间外去找他们，而这一类来客又多是有急病或是远地赶来的病人，遇到这种情况，流诊所的工作人员便会将其他事情搁下，尽速地为他们医治。例如市民李正元被大车绊倒了，车轮把他一只小腿上的肉压得稀烂（幸亏没有压断骨头），好些地方骨和肉都脱离了关系了，这是一个多么严重的创伤啊！而且里面还压进去很多泥土和脏东西。当他被抬到流诊所时，天还很早，医政科刘科长却毫不犹豫地连忙从床上爬起来替他动手术。现在李正元每天还坐着担架到“丛台”换药，每当他带着更大的喜悦回家的时候，他常好说这样一句话：“有了八路军的医生，我这辈子得救了”。的确是这样，开始的时候，不反李正元自己，连他的亲属邻里都曾为他的腿，乃至于生命耽忧过，可是现在在流诊所负责的治疗下，他的腿正以最快的速度在生长着新的肌肤。
    “丛台”——现在是这么一个令人喜爱的地方，每天总有几十个人朝那里去，其中间或还有从三四十里赶来看病的农民。使人想起乡下人赶庙会的情景。在流诊所的桌子上，我看到这样的统计数字：四月份共诊治九百三十五个病人，出诊四五次，来检查病的一百七十名，又义务治疗所用的药，计一万零一百多元。据说这个数还不够完全。此外，他们在防疫工作上，四月份与大家医院等合作，替市区及市郊群众（多是小孩）施种牛痘，共四千二百余人。经他们训练种痘手术，发给痘苗给小学教员回去种的，还没有计算在内。
    黄昏时，我离开卫生局，正要到北门里的市民会去，在门口却遇到一位老年人，他指着卫生局的房子说：“你才从‘定家寺’来？”我点点头，随后，便是他眉飞色舞地在叙述着这短时期内的大变化了，他说：那里原先住着特务暗杀机关，民主政府来后，把那几个领敌人津贴的汉奸郭采芹（伪冀南道剿共司令）郭化民（伪自卫团长）的心腹、霸占民地、强奸民女的主事僧叫什么慈云、志远的黑枪也搜出来了，还把霸地归还老百姓种。现在却换的是救人活命的卫生局流诊所，真好，真好。稍停，他又问我：“听说还要在那里立医院，是真的吗”？我说“是真的”，并且把卫生局朱局长谈的话转告他：杨主席对这件事很关心，特别拨了十一万块钱建筑，还说只要对老百姓有利，多花点钱也值得。我又告诉他我来时朱局长他们正在“定家寺”附近计划着院址，预计三个月可以修成，到时候可以收容比流诊所好几倍的病人。老年人喜形于色，但又带着感叹的说：“老弟，你知道后湖岸上那个土山是谁修的吗？”他指着“丛台”那个方向问我，我摇摇头表示不知道，他便接上说：“那是杨肇基修的，他跟日本人跟姨太太们在湖心亭里想，该在湖边起一座山，好在游罢湖后登上去观观湖里的风光，他这一想不要紧，老百姓却得负担上万的工……。”接着他慨叹地说：“唉！老弟，你想想看，过去有那一次修筑‘丛台’是为了老百姓？？只有现在世道变了，事事都以民为主，这才是真正的民主，就以修‘丛台’来说也是一样”。他近乎自语地说了一回之后，又转来向我：“咱们杨主席见识真高，‘丛台’真是一个顶适宜于养病的地方啦！”夕阳下，远望着一片湖光柳色，我想：古老的“丛台”，现在是你新生的时候了。
