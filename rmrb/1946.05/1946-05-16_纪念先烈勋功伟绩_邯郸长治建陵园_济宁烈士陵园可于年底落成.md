　　To eternally commemorate the anti-Japanese war martyrs and educate future generations, the Second Session of the Border Region Assembly has decided to build martyrs' mausoleums in Handan and Changzhi respectively. A Martyrs' Mausoleum Committee has been formed by the Border Region Government and the 129th Division. Construction has already begun in Handan, and work has also started in Changzhi. It has been decided that the mausoleums should be filled with flowers, plants, and trees to create beautiful scenery and inspire contemplation. The committee recently issued a notice, hoping that Party, government, military, and civilian organizations and individuals in various regions will make every effort to contribute local rare flowers and plants, especially pines, cypresses, fruit trees, and other items suitable for sightseeing, such as gold, stone carvings, etc., to the martyrs' mausoleums (donations are especially welcome, and purchases will be paid for at market prices). This will ensure that the mausoleums become elegant and solemn scenic spots to comfort the loyal souls.

　　Another report: The Jilu Yu Administrative Office also established a Preparatory Committee for the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery at the end of last month. The Administrative Office has allocated 10 million yuan to undertake the construction in Jining, which is estimated to be completed by the end of this year.
