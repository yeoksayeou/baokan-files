　　Xingtai City Establishes
    Federation of Trade Unions for All Industries
    [Xinhua News Agency Jinji-Luyu General Branch News] The Federation of Trade Unions for All Industries in Xingtai City was established on the 4th at the city's first representative conference of workers. Fifty-five worker representatives represented 32 trade unions in the city, including railways, electricity, automobiles, flour, flatbed carts, bathhouses, barber shops, general merchandise, iron, wood, and construction, with 1,900 members and more than 4,000 workers. The conference lasted for three days, summarizing the development of the labor movement in Xingtai City over the past seven months, and pointed out: (1) The workers of Xingtai City are the locomotives in the mass struggle against traitors and for the redress of grievances. The famous "City Damen Hutong Gong" and the struggle against the traitor and local tyrant Meng Xianda were both led by workers. (2) A large number of trade union cadres have been trained and participated in government work. (3) The treatment of workers and shop assistants has been initially improved, rickshaw workers have been organized to change careers and engage in transportation, and more than 40,000 jin of grain have been provided to unemployed railway workers. The representative conference also discussed and formulated the trade union work program and organizational regulations in detail, and passed more than 50 important proposals, such as the request of young shop assistants to increase one hour of study, the request of rickshaw workers for loans, the request of railway workers for salary increases, the request of shop assistants for armed self-defense, and opposition to managers hindering workers from joining trade unions, all of which were properly resolved after discussion. Finally, the conference carefully elected Meng Fu, Yuan Beixing, and 13 others as executive committee members of the City Federation of Trade Unions, and Meng Fu was elected as chairman.
