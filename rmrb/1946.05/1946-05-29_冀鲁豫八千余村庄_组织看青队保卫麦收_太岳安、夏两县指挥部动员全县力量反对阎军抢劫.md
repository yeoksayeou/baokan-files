　　Over 8,000 Villages in Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    Organize Crop Watching Teams to Protect Wheat Harvest
    Headquarters in Anyi and Xia Counties of Taiyue Mobilize the Entire County to Resist Yan Army's Looting
    [Our Newspaper, Heze News] After the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Commission issued a call for armed protection of the wheat harvest, over 6,000 villages in more than ten counties, including Shen County, Heze, and Guancheng, have been organized. In the new areas of Heze, Hua County, Qibin, and Dingtao counties, over 2,000 villages have established crop watching measures and organized crop watching teams, with militia enthusiastically participating.
    [Our Newspaper, Yangcheng News] The wheat in Anyi and Xia counties is about to ripen, and the Yan Army is actively preparing to loot it in various places. The Anyi and Xia County Headquarters has issued a call: "Mobilize all forces in the entire county to complete quick reaping, quick threshing, quick drying, and quick storage, and fight to protect grain and resist the Yan Army's looting!" The Anyi-Xia Joint Office also convened the Sixth Regional Central Primary School Principals' Meeting on May 17th to specifically study this work. The final decisions were: (1) All schools will begin a one-month wheat harvest vacation from May 25th to carry out the wheat harvest. (2) During the vacation, all teachers will lead children to reap wheat, glean wheat, deliver food, take care of livestock, and cooperate with the militia self-defense teams to stand guard. Every three days, they will report on the Yan Army's grain looting and the masses' grain protection efforts, as well as major domestic and international events, on the public blackboard, and conduct propaganda on the spot to expose special agents' rumors.
