　　U.S. State Department Rift Widens as Reactionaries Oust Progressives
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Contradictions within the U.S. State Department have gradually widened. According to a United Press report: The widening rift within the State Department will affect U.S. foreign policy on almost every major issue. This rift has caused the resignation of McCormack, the organizer of the Central Intelligence Agency, because reactionaries within the State Department undermined his plans. It is predicted that other important resignations will follow, with Deputy Secretary of State Acheson and Assistant Secretary of State Clayton being the main possible resignations. The rift is a clear struggle between career diplomats in the diplomatic field and more progressive figures. Non-career diplomats such as Acheson and Clayton advocate that the United States must develop a more far-sighted foreign policy than the diplomats, but are opposed by career diplomats.

　　美国务院裂痕扩大反动派排斥进步人士
    【新华社延安十七日电】美国务院内的矛盾已逐渐扩大。据合众社讯：国务院中逐渐扩大之裂痕，将在几乎一切主要问题上影响美国的外交政策，此种裂痕已造成中央谍报部组织者麦考麦克的辞职，因为国务院内反动派破坏了他的计划。据测其他重要辞职将接踵而至，可能辞职的主要是副国务卿亚泽森及助理国务卿克莱顿。裂痕显见外交界之职业外交家与较进步人士之间的斗争，非职业外交家如亚泽森及克莱顿等人，主张美国必须发展较外交家们更有远见的外交政策，但遭受职业外交家的反对。
