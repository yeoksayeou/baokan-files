　　Coal Miners' Strike Extends for Forty Days
    American Industry Plunges into Stagnation
    Chicago, Washington, and Other Cities Plunged into Darkness
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] The coal miners' strike, lasting forty days in demand for improved living conditions, has shaken the entire United States. Its impact has been quite significant, not only reducing coal production but also bringing railway transportation, various industries, electricity, and water supplies to a near standstill. According to US Secretary of the Interior Krug, the coming months will bring even greater blows. Since the beginning of the strike, coal shipments overseas in April have decreased by 50%, from the original quota of 1.6 million tons. If the strike does not end this month, it will drop to 15% of normal levels. The coal shortage in the United States next year will be worse than during any period of the war. Krug estimates that coal production losses in April reached 53 million tons, with a continuing weekly loss of 13 million tons. Due to the lack of coal, major cities such as Chicago, Washington, and Philadelphia have been plunged into darkness, and ice companies predict losses of 300 million pounds of food. The New York Central Railroad announced that 126 trains would be suspended on the 10th, paralyzing many industries. Ford Motor Company has had to suspend operations for its 110,000 workers due to fuel shortages. A General Motors spokesman said the plant would close in ten days, leaving 115,000 workers unemployed by next Monday. Manager DeGise of the American Can Company stated that the coal miners' strike has gradually affected the tinplate industry, and the threat of severe food shortages may continue until 1947.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] Labor unrest in the United States continues to expand. According to recent statistics from the US Department of Labor, 1.6 million workers are still on strike. Following the coal miners' strike, five maritime unions in the United States have resolved to demand higher wages and improved working conditions; otherwise, they will blockade and strike all ships in American ports on June 15th. The union also called on organized labor worldwide to support the strike, which, if implemented, would paralyze American ports.

　　煤矿工潮绵延四旬
    美工业陷停顿状态
    芝加哥华盛顿等城已黑暗无光
    【新华社延安十一日电】为要求改善生活条件而坚持四旬的煤矿工人大罢工，已震动全美，影响所及，颇为巨大，此不仅使煤产因而减低，而且使铁路运输、各工业、电气及自来水来源等，几陷于停顿状态。据美内务部长克鲁格称：今后数月，将予人以更重大打击。自罢工开始以来，四月份运往海外之煤减少百分之五十，原定额为一百六十万吨。本月份罢工如不终止，则更将降至平时之百分之十五，而来年美国缺乏煤之情形，将较战时任何时期更为恶劣。克氏估计四月份煤之生产损失达五千三百万吨，而目下每星期继续损失一千三百万吨。由于煤炭缺乏，芝加哥、华盛顿与费城等大城市，已黑暗无光，冰冻公司预示将损失三万万磅食粮。纽约中央铁路局通告，一百二十六列火车将于十日停驶，由此将使许多工业陷于麻痹状态。福特汽车公司，由于燃料缺乏，该厂十一万工人不得不停止工作。通用汽车公司发言人称：该厂将在十日内关门，至下星期一止，将有十一万五千名工人赋闲。美罐头公司经理德吉斯称：由于煤矿工人罢工，已渐影响及锡铁工业，严重的粮食欠缺的威胁，可能延续至一九四七年。
    【新华社延安十一日电】美工潮继续扩大中。据美劳工局最近统计，迄今罢工工人仍有一百六十万人。继煤矿工人大罢工后，美国五个海员工会决议要求提高工资，改善工作条件，否则将美国各港口所有舰只在六月十五日封锁罢航。该工会并号召全世界有组织的劳工支持此罢工，罢工一旦实现，将使美国各港口陷于麻痹状态。
