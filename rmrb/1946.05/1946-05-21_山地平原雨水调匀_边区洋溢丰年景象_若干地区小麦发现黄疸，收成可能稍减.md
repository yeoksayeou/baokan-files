　　Balanced Rainfall in Mountains and Plains
    Border Region Overflowing with Bumper Harvest Scene
    Wheat Yellowing Discovered in Some Areas, Harvest May Be Slightly Reduced
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan] Since the beginning of spring, rainfall has been evenly distributed in various areas, allowing for timely summer harvesting and planting. A bumper harvest scene, unseen since the War of Resistance, is spread across the smiling faces of 30 million farmers in the entire region. In the Taiyue Liberated Area, there have been four thorough rains since the spring plowing. The 50 million mu of wheat seedlings in the entire area are growing exceptionally robustly, with very full ears. If there are no storms or disasters in the future, a full ten percent wheat harvest is expected. The Handan Plain, the capital of Hebei’s southern Hebei region, and Weixian, Nangong, and Linqing counties in the central area of southern Hebei, will also have a more abundant summer harvest than any year since the War of Resistance due to sufficient spring and summer rainfall. According to experienced farmers, even if it doesn't rain in the future, a good harvest is still possible. Superior land can yield at least one shi per mu, medium land can yield six dou, and on average, at least eight big dou per mu can be harvested. Starting from Handan and driving south along Cheng'an and Daming into the southern and eastern plains of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, including Nanle, Qingfeng, Puyang, Juye, and Jiaxiang counties, as well as the Jining Plain, known as the "Granary of North China," the vast fields are completely covered by vigorous summer wheat. This year's harvest in this area should be even greater than in the Handan Plain. Therefore, in the old and new liberated areas of Taihang in the mountains, this year's wheat harvest will also exceed any year during the war due to favorable rainfall. In counties such as Changzhi, Lucheng, Huguan, Licheng, Xiangyuan, and Pingshun in that region, where the wheat planting area was not large in previous years, the wheat planting area rapidly expanded to 30% of the cultivated land area last year under the active help and leadership of the democratic government. The vigor of this year's wheat seedlings is unprecedented in the past 30 years, and it is estimated that each mu of wheat can yield one shi and six dou. However, wheat yellowing has now begun to be discovered in some areas, and the harvest may be somewhat affected. Excited emotions are encouraging farmers to actively plant and prepare for the second bumper harvest. Over 1.5 million mu of cotton have been planted in Taihang. In the second district of Qin County in Taiyue, over 5,000 mu of cotton have already been planted, and over 2,100 mu of Golden Queen have been promoted. Summer planting has also been widely carried out in areas such as southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and autumn seedlings have emerged in time.

　　山地平原雨水调匀
    边区洋溢丰年景象
    若干地区小麦发现黄疸，收成可能稍减
    【新华社邯郸讯】入春以来，各地雨水调匀，夏收夏种均可适时进行，抗战以来从所未有的丰年景象，洋溢在全区三千万农民的笑脸上，太岳解放区，自春耕以来，已普落透雨四次。全区五千万亩麦苗，长得特别茁壮，出穗甚为饱满。今后如无风暴灾害，麦收可望十成、河北冀南首府的邯郸平原，及冀南中心区的威县、南宫、临清等县，也因春夏雨水充足，夏收当比抗战以来任何一年丰裕。据有经验的农民谈：今后如不下雨，麦子亦可丰收，上等好地每亩最少可打一石，中等地可收六斗，平均每亩至少可收八大斗。由邯郸出发驱车南行，沿成安大名驶入冀鲁豫平原东之南乐、清丰、濮阳、巨野、嘉祥等县，以及素称“华北谷仓”的济宁平原时，广阔的田野，已全为旺盛的夏麦所遮盖。今年这一地区的收成，更当甚于邯郸平原。因之在山地的太行新老解放区，今年的麦收，也因雨水调顺，产量将超过战争期间任何一年。该区长治、潞城、壶关、黎城、襄垣、平顺等县，往年种麦面积不大，去年在民主政府积极帮助领导下，种麦面积，即飞速扩展至耕地面积百分之三十，今年麦苗的茂盛，已为三十年来所未有，预计每亩麦收可打一石六斗。但若干地区小麦现开始发现黄疸，收成可能受若干影响。兴奋的情绪，正鼓舞着农民们积极下种，准备第二个丰收。太行已种棉一百五十余万亩，太岳沁县二区，即已种棉五千余亩，推种金皇后两千一百余亩，冀南、冀鲁豫等区，夏种亦已普遍进行，现秋苗已适时出土。
