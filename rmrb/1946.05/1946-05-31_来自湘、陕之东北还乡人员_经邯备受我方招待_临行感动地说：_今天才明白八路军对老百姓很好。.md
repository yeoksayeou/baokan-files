　　Returning Personnel from Xiang and Shan Provinces in the Northeast
    Treated Well by Our Side in Handan
    Moved to Say: "Today We Understand that the Eighth Route Army Treats the People Well."
    [Our Dispatch] Returning personnel from the Northeast, originating from the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Hunan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Shandong provinces, passed through Handan on their way north to Shijiazhuang. As of May 24th, three groups totaling 199 people had arrived in Handan. The local Border Region Relief Association warmly welcomed them, doing its utmost to provide assistance by distributing 27,900 yuan for travel expenses, 560 jin of millet, and 400 yuan for medical expenses. Upon their departure, they gratefully said: "You are taking such good care of us, even responsible for inviting doctors to treat our illnesses. We used to hear the Central Army say that the Eighth Route Army kills and burns. Today we understand that the Eighth Route Army treats the people very well."

　　来自湘、陕之东北还乡人员
    经邯备受我方招待     
    临行感动地说：“今天才明白八路军对老百姓很好。”
    【本报讯】来自湖南、陕西、河南、山东等省国民党统治区的东北还乡人员，道经邯郸北上石家庄，截至五月二十四日止，已有三批一百九十九人到达邯郸。此间边区救济分会热忱招待；并竭力资助，发给路费二万七千九百元、小米五百六十斤，医药费四百元。临行时，他们很感激地说：你们照顾真周到，有病还负责请医生治疗，我们过去常听到中央军讲八路军杀人放火，今天我们才明白八路军对老百姓是很好的。
