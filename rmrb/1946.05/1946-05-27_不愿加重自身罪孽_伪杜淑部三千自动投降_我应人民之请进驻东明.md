　　Unwilling to Increase Their Own Sins
    Pseudo-Du Shu Troops Voluntarily Surrender
    We Enter Dongming at the Request of the People
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 25th Dispatch] (Delayed) The 3,000-strong pseudo-army of Du Shu in Dongming completely and voluntarily surrendered to us at 15:00 on May 23rd. Our troops, at the request of the people, have entered and garrisoned Dongming. Order within the city has been completely restored. Du Shu and his officers and soldiers were instigated by fascist elements within the Kuomintang to surrender to the enemy. They now express repentance for this action that betrayed the national spirit. After surrendering to the enemy, they were unwilling to increase their sins, and on the 23rd, they withdrew from the civil war and stood on the side of peace.
