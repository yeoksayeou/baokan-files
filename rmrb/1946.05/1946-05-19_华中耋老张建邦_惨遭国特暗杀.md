　　Hua Zhong Elder Zhang Jianbang
    Tragically Assassinated by KMT Secret Agents
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 14th] Mr. Zhang Jianbang (Weixun), a 73-year-old elder from Hua Zhong, was assassinated by Kuomintang secret agents. The Zhang family resided in Gaozhuang, west of Zhangji on the Shang(qiu)-Qiu(xian) Bo(zhou) highway. He once served as the acting county magistrate of Funing and as a counselor in Zhang Zhongli's Independent First Division of the National Revolutionary Army. In October 1944, he joined the Xue(feng), Shang, Bo Office in the Liberated Area. Known for his integrity, he was resented by the Kuomintang reactionaries. On the night of the thirteenth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year, three secret agents lured him from his home and shot him. The tragic news only recently spread, and the military and civilians of Suwan were deeply saddened upon hearing it. In addition to holding a memorial service, the government will also allocate funds for condolences.
