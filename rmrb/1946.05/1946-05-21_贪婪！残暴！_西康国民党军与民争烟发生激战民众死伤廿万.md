　　Greedy! Brutal!
    Guomindang Troops in Xikang Clash with People over Opium, Resulting in 200,000 Civilian Casualties
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] According to the Tianjin Dagongbao: The Guomindang army recently implemented "armed opium eradication" in Sichuan and Xikang, repeatedly engaging in fierce battles with the local people. In Tianquan and Rongjing counties alone, over 200,000 people were killed or injured. Some villages were completely razed to the ground, leaving no living creature behind. The fighting is still ongoing in the area. Currently, the Xikang Overseas Students Association and the Chongqing University and other school student associations have organized a "Xikang Students' Joint Petition Group in Chongqing to Protect Their Hometowns," and held a press conference on the 3rd of this month, calling for a cessation of these actions.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch: Sichuan Province Chairman Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing late on the 16th from Chongqing and paid a visit to Chiang Kai-shek the next morning.
