　　Children's Home
    A Visit to the "Welfare Nursery" in Handan

            Going to the Children's Home
    I visited the "Welfare Nursery" outside the North Gate of Handan with a joyful heart.
    When I gently pushed open the gate and passed through a section of the children's playground, I saw the children's close friends, Director Zhou, Instructor Li, and several other comrades in the room to the right. They were busy planning new construction for the nursery. I looked around. The swings, slides, and rocking boats in the yard, the tables, chairs, and benches in the room... everything was so small, clever, and lovable. The owners of these furnishings are now forty children aged two to six. I heard that the number will soon double, and later, infant classes will be added, even expanding to accommodate all the young children. Let us eagerly anticipate that day.
    A few days before my visit, some of the children had measles. Most of those who hadn't contracted measles were temporarily taken back by their parents, and they are only now being sent back one after another. Although there are not many children, their voices are everywhere. A group of children surrounded a little girl calling her "sister." I heard she is the class leader of their kindergarten class (three to six years old). She helped up a child who had fallen and then sat quietly in the corner, humming a little tune happily. Below her are three group leaders, each leading three members. "This is a method we came up with through trial and error," Director Zhou explained. When they started in early March, there were few children, and it was easy to manage. Later, as the number of children increased, it became difficult. There were quarrels, sleeping in, even smashing glass and urinating everywhere. After thinking it over, they came up with this grouping and competition method. The children were extremely happy. Everyone wanted to "wear a little red flower on their chest" and they all became well-behaved. Xiao Lin used to sleep in, but now that she is a group leader, she doesn't sleep in anymore. Xiao Lei, who didn't talk, also started talking. Jihua voluntarily helps the little brothers and sisters in the infant class put on their socks and is willing to sing and dance in front of everyone. Jianguo, who was afraid of class, now shouts in a high-pitched voice when he hears the bell: "Class is starting!" When he needs to urinate, he stands up respectfully and says: "Report, I need to go to the restroom!"... This group of innocent and cheerful children, from an early age, develop a habit of unity, mutual assistance, and love of the group. In the future collective cause of the people, there is no doubt that they will play a greater role.

            Children Growing Up in War
    The children here share the common characteristics of all children in the liberated areas behind enemy lines: they are all conceived and raised in war and disaster. Moreover, their parents insisted on the anti-Japanese struggle under the fire of cannons in the past, and now they are still wholeheartedly dedicated to the cause of people's peace and democracy. From a general humanitarian point of view alone, society should first nurture and raise this group of children well.
    When we walked to the door of the children's canteen in the backyard (now an isolation room for thirteen children with measles), the children who had begun to recover their health were all vying to press their faces against the glass window, staring at us with wide eyes. With the doctor's permission, we pushed the door open and went in. Five-year-old Li Yang, sitting on a small wooden bed with railings, greeted Instructor Li, saying: "Mom, who is this?" After his mother's introduction, Little Li Yang immediately called me "Uncle Du, Comrade Du" very affectionately. He also asked me if I knew his uncle, why his uncle didn't come to see him, etc. His mother said: "Uncle is in the Northeast, and the Kuomintang are fighting them!" Little Li Yang became unhappy and pouted, saying: "The Kuomintang are really bad guys! They are wholeheartedly fighting a civil war!" This five-year-old life has already survived six or seven major "mopping-up" operations and raids by the enemy, and also survived a severe famine in the guerrilla areas. When he was born, his mother ate black beans and had no milk to feed him. Only six days later, they encountered an enemy "mopping-up" operation. At that time, his father was busy commanding the troops to fight, leaving his tired mother to hide him in the mountains of western Hebei. When he was thirsty, he drank the stinky water in the pit. As a result, the child began to develop malaria. During the great famine of 1943, he also suffered from kala-azar. After the battle, his mother had to continue to work as usual, and the child fell off the kang, cried until he was full, and then fell asleep, covered in dirt.... Little Li Yang grew up in this environment. His little neighbor, Hong Qi, also had the same experience. Now Little Hong Qi can vaguely remember the enemy's major "mopping-up" operation in May 1943. The wet nurse was killed, and he and his sister (the wet nurse's daughter) hid in the firewood. The enemy shook their bayonets and roared, but they didn't find them. Later, he followed his father and mother and lived near the enemy's Laoding Mountain stronghold in Changzhi for a year and a half, and recognized four godmothers. When the enemy set out, his father and mother both went to fight, leaving Little Hong Qi to live with his godmothers...
    As he spoke, a child rushed in, and all the children began to sing in unison: "Xiao Dongping, you're so naughty, you broke the glass and that's not all...". This is Commander Chen of the First Column's child. In the worst years (June 1941), he grew up on the turbulent plains of southern Hebei, which made him develop a rough and uninhibited character. The responsibility for this certainly lies with the brutal Japanese fascists, but the past is finally over. The nurturing of these children of cadres who have suffered all kinds of devastation and torture and who have contributed to the country and the nation should be everyone's responsibility. This question lingered in my mind for a long time, and today it has begun to be resolved. Moreover, I firmly believe that with the support of our democratic government and everyone, the childcare cause in our liberated areas will develop greatly.

            Pure Calls
    In the nursery, there is one thing that I dare not ask more about, nor dare to think about it too much. Really, who would believe that among these innocent, identically jumping children, there could be any misfortune? However, the reality is so cruel and ruthless! We can mention less about the children who lost their parents in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but today, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries are using the fire of civil war to forcibly take away the children's parents! Reason compels me to make a pure call for the children: "We don't want civil war! We don't want civil war!!" Three-year-old Li Xiaozhong, whenever he sees his mother and thinks of his father, his mother tells him with tears in her eyes: "Your father was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries!" This eternal hatred has been deeply etched in this young heart! Now the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war cannon fire is aimed at the Northeast, the Central Plains, and eastern Henan... Many children's fathers are there. Let us once again make a pure call for the children: "We don't want civil war! We don't want civil war!!"
    The children's close friends, Director Zhou, Instructor Li, and other comrades working in the nursery, have repeatedly talked about this issue and expressed their willingness to devote themselves to the childcare cause of the revolutionary descendants. Regarding this, I have also heard the same expressions at the Taihang Nursery. Because they are all motherhood who have come through war and disaster, they understand the importance of childcare and will do this work very well. And they have only one request: in addition to the government's fixed quota of funds, they hope that all parties will give them more help. They need other things, especially medicines, and they still need a large sum of construction funds. Now, let me record these words spoken from the mouths of the children's friends here and forward them to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, as well as all social charitable organizations and people who are enthusiastic about public welfare.

　　幼儿之家
    邯郸“福利托儿所”访问记
            到幼儿之家去
    我怀着喜悦的心情，去拜访了邯郸北门外的“福利托儿所”。
    当我轻轻推开栅门，通过一段孩子们的游戏场之后，在右面的耳室里便见到幼儿们的挚友，周所长、黎指导员和另外几位同志，他们正忙着筹划所里新的建设。我纵目四望，院子里的秋千、滑梯、摇船，屋子里的桌椅、板凳……一切都是那么矮小伶俐得可爱。这些家具的主人，现在是四十个二至六周岁的幼儿。听说，不久将要增加到一倍，以后，还要增设乳儿班，甚至一直扩大到能收容所有的幼儿。让我们热情地期待着这么一天吧。
    我去的前几天，有一部分小孩害麻疹病，没有害麻疹的，大多由父母暂时领回去，现在才陆续送来。小孩虽然不多，却到处都是他们的声音，一群幼儿围着叫“姐姐”的那个小女孩，听说是他们幼稚班（三周岁至六周岁）的班长，她把一个跌倒的幼儿搀起来，便又温文地坐在屋角里，愉快地哼着小曲。在她下面有三个小组长，每个组长带领三个组员，“这也是从摸索中想出来的办法”，周所长解释着说。他们三月初创办的时候，小孩少，好管理，后来孩子们越来越多，便不好办了，不是吵架，便是睡懒觉，甚至砸玻璃、乱撒尿。想来想去，便想出这个编组，比赛的办法，孩子们真高兴极了，谁都愿意把“一朵朵红花挂在胸前”，都学乖了。小琳过去好睡懒觉，现在当了小组长，不睡懒觉啦。不讲话的小磊也讲话啦。继华自动替婴儿班的小弟弟，小妹妹们穿袜子，也肯在大家面前唱歌跳舞啦。怕上课的建国，现在一听到钟声，便尖着嗓子喊：“上课罗！”要撒尿的时候，便规规矩矩地站起来说：“报告，我要上茅房！”……这群天真烂漫的孩子，从小便养成一种团结互助爱群的习惯，在未来人民的集体事业中，毫无疑问，他们是会起到更大的作用的。
            在战争中生长的孩子们
    这里的幼儿，有着所有敌后解放区孩子们共同的特点，都是在战争和灾难中孕育生长的。并且他们的父母过去在炮火下坚持了抗日斗争，现在也还是全心意地献身在人民和平民主的事业里。就单就一般的人道观点来说，也要求社会首先把这批幼儿养育好。
    当我们走到后院的幼儿食堂门口（现在是十三个害麻疹幼儿的隔离室），已经开始恢复健康的孩子们，都争着把脸贴到玻璃窗上，睁大着眼睛在看我们。经过医生的允许，我们推门进去。五周岁的黎洋，坐在装着栏栅的小木床上招呼着黎指导员说：“妈妈，这是谁？”经过他妈妈的介绍，小黎洋马上就很亲昵地“杜叔叔，杜同志”地呼唤着我。还问我知不知道他伯伯，他伯伯为什么不来看他等等，他母亲说：“伯伯在东北，国民党正打他们呢！”小黎洋便不高兴起来了，努着嘴说：“国民党，真坏蛋！一心一意打内战！”这五周岁的小生命，却已渡过敌人六七次的大“扫荡”和奔袭，又曾在游击区里渡过了严重的荒年。他出生的时候，母亲吃着黑豆，没有奶喂他，才六天便碰到敌人的“扫荡”，那时父亲忙着指挥队伍打仗，只丢下劳累的母亲把他藏在冀西的大山里，渴了便喝着坑里的臭水，这样，小孩子便开始发起虐疾来。四三年大灾荒的时候，还害过一场黑热病。打罢仗，母亲又要照常的忙碌着工作，孩子便从炕上跌下来，哭饱了又睡去，弄得混身是土。……小黎洋就是在这种环境下生长起来的。他的小邻居红骑，也和他有着同样的经历。现在小红骑还能模糊记得，敌人四三年五月的大“扫荡”，奶娘被杀死了，他和姐姐（奶娘的女孩）躲在柴里，敌人晃着刺刀咕噜噜地吼叫，却没有找到他们。后来便随着爸爸和妈妈，在长治敌人老顶山据点附近住了一年半，认了四个干娘，敌人出发的时候，爸爸和妈妈都打仗去了，留下小红骑跟干娘过活。……
    说着说着，一个孩子闯进来了，所有的小孩便都齐唱起来：“小东平，真捣蛋，打了玻璃还不算………”。这是一纵队陈司令员的小孩，严重的年份里（四一年六月），他生长在动荡的冀南平原上，使他养成一副粗野放任的性格，这责任固然在于残暴的日本法西斯身上，但是过去终于是过去了，对于这些受尽摧残和折磨的功在国家民族的干部孩子们的抚育，应该是大家的责任，这问题长久地在我脑子里萦绕着，今天已开始得到解决。并且，我坚信在我们民主政府和大家支持下，我们解放区的保育事业，将会大大地发展的起来。
            纯真的呼喊
    在托儿所里，有一件事使我不敢多问，也不敢多去想它。真的，谁敢相信在这些天真无邪一式一样地跳跃着的幼儿里，还有什么不幸呢？然而，现实却是那样地残酷无情！在抗日战争中失去父母的孩子，我们可以不多提了，但是抗战胜利后的今天，国民党反动派却用内战的炮火，强夺去孩子们的双亲！理性驱使我，要为孩子们作一次纯真的呼喊：“我们不要内战！我们不要内战！！”三周岁的李小中，每当看到他妈妈的时候，联想到他爸爸，母亲便含泪地告诉他：“爸爸是国民党反动派杀死的！”这个永恒的仇恨，已经深深地刻划在这稚小的心灵里！现在国民党反动派内战的炮火，正对准东北、中原和豫东………好多孩子们的父亲，就在那里，让我们再替孩子们作一次纯真的呼喊：“我们不要内战！我们不要内战！！”
    幼儿们的挚友——周所长，黎指导员和托儿所其他的工作同志，好几次都谈到这个问题，并且表示她们愿意为革命后代的保育事业而献身。关于这，我在太行保育院那里也听到过同样的表示。因为她们都是从战争与灾难中过来的母性，她们懂得保育事业的重要，也会把这工作作得很好。而她们只有一个要求：除政府定额经费外，希望各方面多多给予她们以帮助。她们需要别的东西，尤其需要药品，她们还得用一大笔建设费。现在，让我把这些从幼儿挚友们嘴里说出来的话，记录在这里，一并转给联合国救济总署，以及一切社会慈善机关和热心公益事业的人们吧。
