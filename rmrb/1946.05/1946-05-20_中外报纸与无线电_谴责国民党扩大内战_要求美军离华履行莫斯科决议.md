　　Chinese and Foreign Newspapers and Radio
    Condemn the Kuomintang's Expansion of the Civil War
    Demand American Troops Leave China and Implement the Moscow Resolution
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Moscow Radio today broadcast: Chinese and foreign newspapers and radio stations continue to comment on the situation in China, unanimously pointing out that in addition to the civil war in Manchuria, which is expanding, civil wars have also begun to unfold in North China and Central China. Since May, the civil war has spread to the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Shandong. Among the Kuomintang troops attacking these provinces, there are also a large number of former puppet troops who were incorporated. At the same time, Chinese and foreign newspapers unanimously condemned the U.S. military for helping the Kuomintang army fight the civil war and demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. The New York Herald Tribune and the British Tribune, in analyzing the reasons for the expansion of the Chinese civil war, both pointed out that the Kuomintang right wing is implementing a go-slow approach to political reconciliation and has achieved considerable success. The Herald Tribune also pointed out that the Kuomintang government has not yet released political prisoners, disbanded the secret police, or given the people the power to freely express their will. Shanghai Wenhui Bao and other newspapers unanimously pointed out that the United States is seriously involved in the Chinese civil war, with the Kuomintang army obtaining artillery and other weapons from the United States and using them to slaughter Chinese people. At the same time, U.S. warships are transporting American-trained Kuomintang troops to various combat areas to oppose the CCP army. World News Review magazine, when commenting on the expansion of the Chinese civil war not long ago, pointed out that the U.S. authorities have not yet implemented the Moscow Conference's decision to withdraw foreign troops from China. The Washington Post wrote, "We do not know when our troops will withdraw from China; this is a fact."

　　中外报纸与无线电
    谴责国民党扩大内战
    要求美军离华履行莫斯科决议
    【新华社延安十七日电】莫斯科今日广播：中外报纸与无线电，继续评论中国局势，一致指出除满洲内战正在扩大以外，华北、华中又开始展开内战，五月来内战已蔓延到河北、河南、江苏、湖北、山东各省。进攻这些省的国民党军队中，还有大量收编的伪军。同时，中外报纸一致谴责美军帮助国民党军打内战，并要求撤退驻华美军。美纽约先驱论坛报及英论坛报，在分析中国内战扩大的原因时，均指出国民党右派对政治和解实行怠工，而且已获相当成效。先驱论坛报并指出，国民党政府至今尚未释放政治犯，解散秘密警察，以及予人民自由表示意志的权力。上海文汇报及其他报纸，一致指出美国严重地卷入中国内战，国民党军从美国获得大炮及其他武器，并用它来屠杀中国人。同时美舰运送由美人训练的国民党军到各作战地区去，反对中共军队。世界新闻评论杂志不久前评中国内战扩展时，指出美国当局直到现在没有执行莫斯科会议关于从中国撤退外国军队的决定。华盛顿邮报写道，我们不知道我国的军队将在什么时候从中国撤退，这是事实。
