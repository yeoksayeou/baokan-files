　　Far East Military Tribunal Tries Tojo and Other War Criminals
　　[New China News Agency, Yan'an, Fifteenth Dispatch] Tokyo News: The Far East Military Tribunal held its third hearing on May 13th for Tojo and 28 other war criminals. Kiyose Ichiro, the chief defense lawyer for the accused, representing all defense lawyers, questioned the scope of war crimes designated by the court and its jurisdiction, cunningly claiming that the Japanese occupation of the Northeast did not fall within the scope of the Pacific or "Greater East Asia War." He also claimed that the court had no right to judge the accused, attempting to prove that the Allied powers could not apply the declaration against Germany to Japan. Soviet Judge Ki Nan pointed out that this kind of argument was "extremely ridiculous." The Presiding Judge, Australian representative Webb, also warned Kiyose not to make arguments that violated the facts. The chief prosecutor announced a provision in the Potsdam Declaration: "The source of those who used deceptive means to lead the Japanese people onto the path of militarism must be permanently eliminated." The court then adjourned and was scheduled to reconvene on the 14th.

　　远东军事法庭审东条等战犯
    【新华社延安十五电】东京讯：远东军事法庭于五月十三日第三次开审东条等二十八名战犯，被告之总辩护律师清濑一郎，代表全体辩护律师，对法庭所指定的战罪范围及其权限问题提出诘问，狡称：日侵占东北，不属太平洋或“大东亚战争”。围内，并称：法庭无权被判告，企图藉此证明盟国不能以对于德国的宣言搬用于日本，苏法官季楠指出，此种辩论“可笑之极”。法庭庭长澳代表威范审此亦警告清濑，勿作违犯事实之辩论。总起诉人宣布波茨顿宣言内一条规定：“必须将那些用欺骗手段使日本人民走上军国主义道路的根源永远消灭掉”。至此法庭休会，定十四日再开。
