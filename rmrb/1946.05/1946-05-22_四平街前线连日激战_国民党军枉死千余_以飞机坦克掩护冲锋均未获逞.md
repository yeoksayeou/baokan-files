(2) The Kuomintang's 66th and 75th armies in the Central Plains, in violation of the Hankou Agreement, divided their forces into six routes on the 16th to encircle and attack the southwestern Shoushan area of Yingshan in western Pinghan Road in the Central Plains Military Region, and have already occupied many villages and towns. Fierce battles are currently underway. (3) In Jinan City, Shandong Province, five or six Kuomintang aircraft land every night, each carrying forty to fifty soldiers. Including the previously airlifted troops, there are approximately 20,000 soldiers. The 12th and 96th armies in Jinan have been attacking the area south of the city since the 10th, and are continuing their incursions. Wang Jimei's puppet troops in Zaozhuang obtained 45 boxes of ammunition transported by Kuomintang aircraft on the 10th, and also show signs of unrest. (4) In Rehe, the Kuomintang army invading Rehe is frequently mobilizing and deploying for civil war. The Kuomintang army is constantly harassing areas such as Pingquan and Jianchang southeast of Chifeng. On the 11th, an aircraft flew over Chengde to conduct reconnaissance. The headquarters of the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region issued a statement protesting.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 19th] Fierce battles have been taking place on the Siping Street front for days. On the 16th and 17th, the invading army lost over a thousand men. On the 16th, they launched an attack under the cover of aircraft and tanks, but were still unsuccessful. The battle report for the past three days is as follows: On the morning of the 16th, two battalions of the Kuomintang army launched an attack on Sandaolinzi and were immediately repelled by the Democratic Allied Army. At the same time, near Yangmulinzi, a Kuomintang aircraft was shot down, and the pilot parachuted to safety. The Kuomintang army has used tanks on the Siping Street front. Yesterday, four Kuomintang tanks, joined by two companies of remnants, attacked the position south of Siping Street. At the same time, four tanks were also dispatched to the position near Keshan, all of which were repelled by the defending troops. On the morning of the 17th, the Kuomintang army used a battalion of troops, concentrating more than twenty artillery pieces, to attack the Sandaolinzi position of the Democratic Allied Army. One company once charged into the defending troops' position. After half an hour of hand-to-hand combat, except for more than ten people who escaped, the rest were all annihilated. The other two companies were severely damaged by dense machine gun crossfire when approaching the position of the Democratic Allied Army. Except for thirty-odd people who escaped, the rest were killed. On the 16th, the Kuomintang army in Banlamenzi, southeast of Siping Street, launched a fierce attack, but was thwarted, with the invaders suffering six to seven hundred casualties.
