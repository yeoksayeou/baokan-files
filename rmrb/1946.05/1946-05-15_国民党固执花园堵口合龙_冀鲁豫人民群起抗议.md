　　Kuomintang Stubbornly Closes Garden Breach
    People of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Provinces Rise Up in Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency Jinji-Luyu General Branch, Heze News] After the news spread that the Kuomintang authorities were undermining the Heze Agreement and stubbornly pursuing their two-month breach closure conspiracy, millions of people in the eighteen counties along the river in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region were extremely angered and rose up to hold meetings and demonstrations to protest and appeal to the whole country to stop this unprecedented and heinous conspiracy by the fascist faction. On the 3rd of this month, 150,000 people in Linze County held meetings in different districts. The masses competed to speak. Mr. Zhao Zhongkai, a landlord from Liuzhuang, said angrily: "For twenty years, the Kuomintang has managed the Yellow River in such a way that floods are everywhere, and the people have lost countless lives and property. Now they want to use 'river management' as a pretext to only close the breach without restoring the dikes, flooding the people, and coordinating with their civil war conspiracy. We swear to oppose it!" At the mass meeting in the Fifth District, 16,000 people attending signed a protest letter, severely warning the Kuomintang authorities to immediately abandon their conspiracy that disregards the lives of the people and implement the Heze Agreement. If the people are forced to do so, they will resolutely rise up in self-defense. Moreover, the masses in 970 villages in ten counties, including Pingyin, in the First District of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, are urgently holding meetings these days. In addition to issuing appeals to compatriots across the country, they are also actively preparing for effective self-defense.
    [Xinhua News Agency Jinji-Luyu General Branch, Handan News] The Jinji-Luyu Border Region Assembly and the Border Region Government jointly sent a telegram to the National Water Conservancy Commission in Nanjing on the 10th of this month, requesting that the original proposal to complete the Yellow River breach closure project in two years be adhered to. The telegram stated: The Yellow River diversion is not simply a construction and river management issue, but a military issue involving the conspiracy and sabotage of the reactionaries. If the absurd theory of closing the breach within two months is not thoroughly corrected, the people of our border region will have no choice but to rise up in self-defense and wage a resolute struggle against the conspirators. It is hoped that your committee will respect the facts, uphold justice, and adhere to the original proposal to complete the breach closure work in two years. On the same day, another telegram was sent to the Shanghai United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, expressing firm opposition to the conspiracy of the Kuomintang authorities to undermine the Heze River management agreement, and hoping that Mr. Todd, the American Chief Engineer of the Administration and the Yellow River Commission, would stop his absurd assertion that "the breach must be closed within two months."

　　国民党固执花园堵口合龙
    冀鲁豫人民群起抗议
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社荷泽讯】国民党当局破坏荷泽协议，固执其两月堵口阴谋的消息传出后，冀鲁豫区沿河十八县数百万群众，愤激万分，纷起集会，示威抗议，并向全国控诉，吁请火速制止法西斯派此种史无先例的罪恶阴谋。本月三日，临泽全县十五万群众分区集会，群众争相发言，刘庄地主赵仲凯先生愤激的说：“二十年来国民党治河治得大水遍地，人民丧失了无数的生命财产，他们现在又想借‘治河’为名，只堵口不复堤，放水淹人，配合其内战阴谋，我们誓死反对！”五区群众大会上，一万六千到会群众，全体签署抗议书，严重警告国民党当局，立即放弃不顾民命的阴谋，执行荷泽协议，人民迫不得已，必奋起自卫。又冀鲁豫一分区平阴等十个县九百七十个村庄群众，连日正紧急集会，除向全国同胞发出呼吁外，并积极准备作有效之自卫。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社邯郸讯】晋冀鲁豫边区参议会、边区政府于本月十日特联名致电南京全国水利委员会，请坚持二年完成黄河堵复工作之原议。电称：黄河改道，不是单纯的建设治河问题，而是包含着反动派阴谋破坏的军事问题。对两月内堵口之谬论如不彻底纠正，我边区人民只有奋起自卫，与阴谋者作坚决斗争。希望贵会尊重事实，坚持正义，坚持二年完成堵复工作之原议。同日，又致电上海联合国善后救济总署，表示坚决反对国民党当局破坏荷泽治河协议之阴谋，并希该署总工程师兼黄委会美籍塔得先生，停止其“两月必须堵口”的荒谬主张。
