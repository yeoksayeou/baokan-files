　　Another Brutal Atrocity!
    Nationalist Army in Xiuwu Raids Our District Office, District Head and Political Commissar Tragically Murdered
    Border Region Assembly Sends Telegram Nationwide to Protest
    [Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] A portion of the Nationalist 32nd Army stationed in Xiuwu City, combined with over 50 secret agents, on the night of the 13th, posing as the Public Security Bureau of our Xiuwu Democratic Government, stealthily crossed the militia警戒线,深入我腹地, and raided the Third District Office in Xifanghu Village, brutally murdering our District Head Comrade Han Kejian and Political Commissar Wang Shiying. The District Office was ransacked, eight rifles and pistols were looted, and over 100,000 Jibi were stolen, and two people were captured. Upon learning of this bloody tragedy, the Standing Committee of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Assembly, representing the 30 million people of the border region, issued a telegram, lodging a serious protest against this breach of agreement and brutality by the Nationalist Army. The telegram stated: "The Xifanghu incident fully demonstrates that the Kuomintang reactionaries, in their attempt to launch a larger-scale civil war, are first eliminating our border region's democratic government," and pointed out, "We must be seriously vigilant. The Xifanghu tragedy is by no means accidental, but a planned bloody massacre by the Nationalist Army. In Xiuwu alone, the tragedies occurring in recent days include: on the 14th, the Kuomintang Xiuwu Security Regiment attacked our Daiwang Village. On the night of the 15th, this unit raided our Wangtianquan again, killing eight cadres and villagers, and capturing over 30 villagers and several militiamen; that same night, the Nationalist Army stationed in Miaozhuang raided our Xiaowangjia Village District Office, arresting over ten people. The Nationalist Army in Mulandian also raided our Wangjia Village at the same time, arresting eight people. On the 16th, this unit raided our Meng Village again." The telegram concluded by calling on the people of the border region to strengthen their self-defense forces, to resolutely shatter the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to continue expanding the civil war and creating large-scale bloody tragedies, and appealed to the people of the nation for support.

    边区参议会通电全国抗议
    【本报特讯】驻修武城之国民党三十二军一部结合特务五十余人，于十三日夜，假充我修武民主政府之公安局，偷越民兵警戒线，深入我腹地，奔袭三区公所驻地西方斛村，将我区长韩克俭政委王世英等同志击毙，区公所被捣毁，抢去长短枪八枝，冀钞十万余元，抓去二人。晋冀鲁豫边区参议会驻委会闻悉这一流血惨案，顷代表边区三千万人民发出通电，对国民党军此种违约暴行提出严重抗议。原电略称：西方斛事件充分表明国民党反动派，在其企图发动更大规模的内战的时候，首先消灭我边区民主政府，继指出：“我们必须严重警惕，西方斛惨案绝不是偶然的，而是国民党军有计划的血腥屠杀行为，只修武一地连日发生的惨案即有：十四日国民党修武保安团袭击我待王村。十五日夜该部再奔袭我王田泉杀死该村干部与群众八人，俘去群众三十余人及民兵数人；同夜，驻苗庄之国民党军奔袭我小王家庄区公所，抓走十余人，木栾店之国民党军亦于同时奔袭我王家庄抓去八人，十六日该部再奔袭我孟村”。该电最后号召边区人民加强自卫力量，有力的粉碎国民党反动派继续扩大内战大规模制造流血惨案的阴谋，并呼吁全国人民予以支援。
