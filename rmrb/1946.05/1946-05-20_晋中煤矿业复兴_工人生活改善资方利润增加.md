　　Shanxi Central Coal Mining Industry Revives
    Workers' Lives Improve, Capitalists' Profits Increase
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 18th] In the coal mining areas of the border mountains spanning over a hundred *li* in the five counties of Quwo, Taiyuan, Qingyuan, Jiaocheng, and Wenshui in Shanxi Central, labor and capital are united and working together to develop production. Under the leadership of the trade unions, workers have signed production contracts with the capitalists. Working hours have generally been reduced from 15-20 hours in the past to 12 hours, and wages have also increased. Mine owners obtain net profits accounting for about 45-50% of the total profits, which is a significant increase compared to their income during the enemy-puppet rule. Furthermore, due to the improvement in workers' lives, production efficiency has generally increased by 20-50% compared to before liberation, and capitalists' profits have also increased accordingly. Currently, many mine owners are working on repairing transportation routes and purchasing water pumps. Wang Baoyuan of the Jin Feng Coal Mine Company said, "Last year, I still had some concerns, but now I clearly see that the democratic government takes care of the interests of both labor and capital." He has already raised funds to start repairing the mine. The total number of coal mines has now reached 194, a fourfold increase compared to the time of enemy occupation. Workers' lives have significantly improved. Thousands of workers have changed into new clothes, and the severe "slack season" unemployment problem of previous years has also been resolved. Landless workers are concentrated in the perennial kilns for coal mining. Workers have surplus grain, some have redeemed their land and married wives. Chen Qi, a coal worker from Qingyuan, was even elected as a member of the Border Region Council. Workers have universally organized reading groups, literacy classes, and night schools to study culture and current events in their spare time.

　　晋中煤矿业复兴
    工人生活改善资方利润增加
    【新华社兴县十八日电】晋中曲阳、太原、清源、交城、文水五县边山绵亘百余里的煤矿区，劳资团结，协力发展生产。工人们在工会领导下，和资方订立生产合同，工作时间一般由过去十五至廿小时减至十二小时，工资亦有增加，窑主获纯利占总利润百分之四十五至五十左右，较之敌伪统治时期收入，大大增加。更因工人生活改善，生产效率一般较解放前提高百分之二十至五十不等，资方获利也随之增加。目前许多窑主，正着手修运道、买吸水机，晋丰煤窑公司王保元说：“去年我还有些顾虑，现在看清楚了民主政府照顾劳资双方利益的。”他已集资动工修窑，现煤窑总数已达一百九十四座，较敌占时增加四倍。工人生活，显著提高。上千的工人，都换上了新衣，历年严重的“淡月”失业问题，亦得到解决。无地工人，都集中到常年窑内挖炭，工人都有积余粮食，有的赎回了土地，娶了老婆，清源煤工陈其，并当选为边区参议员，工人们普遍组织了读报组、识字班、夜校等，作工之余，还学习文化和时事。
