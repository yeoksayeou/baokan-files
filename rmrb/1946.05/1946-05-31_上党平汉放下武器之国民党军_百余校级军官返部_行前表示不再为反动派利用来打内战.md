　　Kuomintang Soldiers Who Laid Down Their Arms in Shangdang and Pinghan
    Over a Hundred Colonel-Level Officers Return to Their Units
    Expressing Before Departure That They Will No Longer Be Exploited by Reactionaries to Fight a Civil War
    [This Newspaper's Report] Kuomintang army officers from the 30th and 40th Armies and the Shanxi-Suiyuan Army who laid down their arms in the Shangdang and Pinghan campaigns have been released in two batches from the Da Xing Military Officer Training Regiment in early May to return to their units. On the 12th and 13th, two more batches, totaling 113 colonel-level officers, were released separately. During their study period at the training regiment, they fully understood the importance of the cause of peace and democracy, the correct policies of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, and the spirit of serving the people. In the days leading up to their departure, they expressed one after another: "We will serve the people and will no longer be exploited by domestic reactionaries to participate in a civil war that brings disaster to the country and harm to the people." At the moment of farewell, everyone was moved to tears. They were reluctant to leave the liberated area. Most people said: "If it weren't for the fact that our families are far away in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, we would never be willing to leave the liberated area."

　　上党平汉放下武器之国民党军
    百余校级军官返部   
    行前表示不再为反动派利用来打内战
    【本报讯】上党、平汉战役放下武器的国民党军三十军、四十军、晋绥军军官，五月上旬已由大行军官教导团释放了两批返部。十二、十三两日，又分别释放了两批共校级军官一百一十三名。由于他们在教导团学习期间，完全领会了和平民主事业的重要，共产党八路军的正确政策和为人民服务的精神，在临走前数天就纷纷表示：为人民服务，不再被国内反动派利用参加祸国殃民的内战。在送别时一刹那，全体都感动得落泪，他们对解放区留恋不舍，大多数人说：如果不是由于家庭远在国民党统治区，我们是决不愿意离开解放区的。
