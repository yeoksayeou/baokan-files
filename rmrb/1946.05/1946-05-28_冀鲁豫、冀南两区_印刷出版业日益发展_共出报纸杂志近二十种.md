　　Ji-Lu-Yu and Ji'nan Regions
    Printing and Publishing Industries are Flourishing           
    Nearly Twenty Newspapers and Magazines Published
    [Our Correspondent in Heze] The printing industry in the Ji-Lu-Yu region has been developing rapidly since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The predecessor of the Ji-Lu-Yu Printing Factory was the Ji-Lu-Yu Bookstore. The factory originally had three lithographic presses and one quarto letterpress. Now it has developed to nine letterpresses, thirteen lithographic presses, and one electric lithographic press, with a capital amount of 35 million yuan. The factory prints 18,000 copies of the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily every day. From June last year to the end of the year, it published 500,000 copies of winter school textbooks, 100,000 copies of primary school textbooks, and hundreds of thousands of copies of propaganda materials. The second largest is the War Comrade Newspaper, which was founded in 1937. Initially, it was a small mimeographed newspaper, then changed to a lithographic newspaper, and in 1945 it was changed to letterpress. The scale is relatively large, with a circulation of over 4,000 copies per issue. The newspaper currently has two foot-operated presses, one lithographic press, and one small octavo press. It has now published over 200 issues. The newspaper also publishes the War Comrade Tri-Weekly, War Comrade Anthology, War Comrade Pictorial, Cultural Life and other publications. In terms of newspapers, there are also the Jinan Daily, a quarto letterpress recently published in Jinan City, as well as the Second Military Sub-district's Advance Newspaper, the Huxi Masses Newspaper, the First Military Sub-district's Beacon Fire Newspaper, and the Fifth Military Sub-district's Masses Newspaper.
    [Our Correspondent in Weixian] The cultural publishing and printing industry in the Ji'nan region has achieved great success. Currently, the entire region publishes four kinds of news newspapers, including the Ji'nan Daily, Unity Newspaper, Iron Current Newspaper, and Pioneer Newspaper. There are four kinds of regular publications, including the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Bi-Monthly, North Feng Bi-Monthly, Masses Communication Quarterly, and Ji'nan People's Collection. There are bookstores including the Ji'nan Bookstore, Lu Northwest Bookstore, Masses Bookstore, Nangong Bookstore, and Pingyuan Bookstore, all of which have attached printing factories. In addition, there is the Ji'nan Administrative Office Printing Factory and many other small-scale farmer reading material printing factories scattered throughout the region. The Ji'nan Daily is a local newspaper in Ji'nan, originally lithographic, with a circulation of 6,000 copies. It was changed to letterpress on New Year's Day this year and has been distributed to 13,000 copies. Since the change to letterpress, a total of 538,000 copies have been distributed. In addition to printing newspapers, the newspaper's printing factory also prints books and undertakes the printing of announcements, averaging 1,700 copies per day. The Ji'nan Bookstore was established on New Year's Day this year and has three letterpresses and two lithographic presses. Since its establishment, it has published 16 kinds of cadre reading materials, 52,000 copies of the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Bi-Monthly, 10,000 copies of textbooks, and 50,000 copies of junior high school textbooks. The Ji'nan Administrative Office Printing Factory has two foot-operated letterpresses and six lithographic presses. It mainly prints primary school textbooks. From January to March of this year alone, it printed eight primary school textbooks, totaling 74,810 copies, and four kinds of cadre reading materials, totaling 5,000 copies. Each other special district has its own special district printing factory for printing textbooks.
