　　Kuomintang Fosters Pseudo-bandits to Disrupt Liberated Areas
    Notorious Bandit Chen Desan's Troops Eliminated
    Shushan Lake Transformed into Fertile Fields, People Produce and Defend Themselves
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze] More than ten gangs, totaling over 600 men, of the notorious bandit Chen Desan's troops, supported by the Kuomintang and entrenched in the Shushan Lake area of our Second Sub-district, have now been disarmed by us. We seized three light machine guns, two grenade launchers, and more than eighty long and short guns. When Bandit Chen began organizing bandits in the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), he only had twenty or thirty men. At that time, He Siyuan sent his special agent Bai Xianen to infiltrate and control the bandit, colluding with Liu Benxiang, the puppet county magistrate of Dengcheng at the time, using the power of the enemy and puppets to expand the organization, oppress the masses, and turn Shushan Lake into a bandit area. Later, the bandit surrendered to Zhang Ziming, the commander of the puppet army (Jining) Wen (shang) Dong (ping) Bandit Suppression, and served as the deputy commander of bandit suppression. After the enemy surrendered, Jining was liberated by us. The Kuomintang appointed the bandit as the Commissioner of the Lusi District and Commander of Bandit Suppression, and sent Kuomintang agent Zhang Guangfu as his secretary. In February, Bai Guanchang, the bandit's chief of staff, led more than thirty armed men to Jinan to contact the Kuomintang. Due to the Kuomintang's support and instructions, they expanded the bandit gang to more than two thousand people and actively invaded the liberated areas. On March 10th, they raided Shilizha and Wulipu areas in our Nanwang County, killing more than ten village cadres and agricultural association cadres, and assassinating a working member of the Second District of Wenshang. After our encirclement and suppression, it is reported that the bandit has fled to Jinan. The lower-level soldiers have surrendered to the democratic government one after another. Only a remnant of his troops are hiding in groups and continuing secret activities. The lake water has now been diverted by us into the Grand Canal, and most of the land has been transformed into fertile fields. The masses in the villages within the lake have now largely established their own organizations, defending themselves while producing.

　　国民党豢养伪匪扰乱解放区
    惯匪陈德三部被肃清
    蜀山湖变为良田人民生产自卫
    【新华社荷泽讯】在国党支撑下盘踞于我二分区蜀山湖一带之惯匪陈德三部十余股，共六百余人，现已被我解除武装。共缴轻机枪三挺、掷弹筒两个、长短枪八十余支。陈匪于民国三十三年开始组织土匪时，仅二、三十人，当时何思源即派其特务白先恩打入，掌握该匪，并与当时邓城伪县长刘本相勾结，借敌伪势力，扩大组织，压榨群众，将蜀山湖变为匪区。该匪后投降伪军（济宁）汶（上）东（平）剿匪司令张子明，任剿匪副司令。敌人投降后，济宁被我解放，国民党委该匪为鲁西区专员兼剿匪司令，并派国特张广福任其秘书。二月间，该匪股长白关昌，曾带武装三十余赴济南与国民党联络，因受国民党之支撑与指令，扩展匪众二千余，积极进犯解放区。三月十日，曾到我南旺县十里闸、五里铺一带抢掠，杀死各村农会干部及村干部十余人，暗杀汶上二区工作员一人。经我围剿，闻该匪已逃至济南，其下层士兵，纷纷向民主政府自首，仅其残余一部，分组隐蔽，继续秘密活动。该湖水现已被我引入运河，大部土地变为良田。现湖内村庄群众，已大部成立了自己的组织，一面自卫，一面生产。
