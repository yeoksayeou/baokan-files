　　【Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 10th dispatch】A relief team of eight people, organized by the UNRRA and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Branch of the Liberated Area Relief Committee, arrived in Yongnian on the 1st to handle relief matters. More than 4,400 refugees who had fled to the liberated areas outside the city were registered by the 6th, and relief supplies will be distributed within days. Relief work within the city has been obstructed by puppet troops in various ways, and no progress has been made. When the team inquired about the total population from the puppet authorities in the city on the 2nd, they were told it was 12,500 people, but the registration results showed 2,358 people, some of whom were personnel of puppet organizations and their families. Currently, the puppet troops are refusing to distribute supplies according to the registered method, and discussions are underway.

　　永年救济工作受到伪军阻扰
    【新华社邯郸十日电】联总行总及解放区救济委员会晋冀鲁豫分会组织之救济小组一行八人，于一日抵永年办理救济事宜，逃至城外解放区的难民四千四百余人，已于六日登记完毕，日内即可发放救济品。城内救济工作，则因伪军多方阻扰，工作迄无任何进展。小组于二日向城内伪方询问总人口时，据云为一万二千五百人，但登记结果，有二千三百五十八人，其中尚有部分伪组织人员及其家属，现伪军拒绝按登记之办法发放物资，各方正在交谈中。
