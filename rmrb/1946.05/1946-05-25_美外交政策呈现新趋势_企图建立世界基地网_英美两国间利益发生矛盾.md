　　US Foreign Policy Presents New Trends
    Attempting to Establish a World Base Network
    Contradictions Arise Between British and American Interests
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] According to TASS, Moscow: Both *Pravda* and *Red Star* published articles on the 19th commenting on the US expansion of bases. *Pravda*, in an article entitled "Using a World Base System as a Weapon of Expansionist Policy," pointed out that many American political commentators regard the "world base system" as a very definite direction and plan for US foreign policy after the war. Wheeler's book, *Bases Overseas*, designs a plan for the US to encircle the world with bases, and exposes the clear tendency of American expansionist groups and their attitude toward solving post-war problems. *Pravda* pointed out that the establishment of a US base network is by no means the result of the fantasies of this or that American journalist, but one of the most fundamental methods that has been put into practice. The "base network" plan has been realized in the negotiations on the US base in Iceland. Their activities in Africa, the Near East, and China are well known. It is noteworthy that Benes and Bevin held negotiations in Paris regarding US bases on Pacific islands. The new trend in US foreign policy represents an important change in the positions of the major US parties—the Republican Party and the Democratic Party—on foreign policy issues. The reactionary forces of American isolationism have turned to the dominance of an active expansionist policy when they put forward new plans, defining their task as establishing US dominance throughout the world. This is the approach of Vandenberg and his followers. One cannot fail to recognize that after Roosevelt's death, the views on foreign policy between the leaders of isolationism and certain leading groups of the Republican and Democratic parties have become closer. *Pravda* concluded that activities in establishing a vast world base network prove that the tendency associated with expansionism currently prevails in the realm of foreign policy, a tendency that is imperialism of the twentieth century. *Red Star* pointed out that the issue of forward air bases is a new factor in international relations, and strongly stated that the US base network plan will cause conflicts between British and American interests, because what the US is pursuing is not only to retain but also to expand its base network, especially in the Near East and Middle East.

　　美外交政策呈现新趋势
    企图建立世界基地网
    英美两国间利益发生矛盾
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报与红星报，十九日均著文评论美国之扩张基地。真理报在题为《以世界基地制度，作为扩张政策的武器》论文中，指出美国许多政论家，均以“世界基地制度”为战后美国外交政策十分确定的方针和计划。惠勒《海外基地》一书，设计了美国应以基地围绕全世界的计划，并暴露了美国扩张集团明确的趋向，与他们解决战后问题的态度。真理报指出，建立美国基地网，决非这个或那个美国记者幻想的结果，而是已付诸实行的最基本方法之一。“基地网”计划，已在美国关于冰岛基地所进行的谈判中实现了，他们在非洲、近东与中国的活动，已是尽人皆知，值得注意的，是在贝纳斯与贝文在巴黎关于美国在太平洋各岛的基地进行谈判的消息，美外交政策新趋势，代表了美国主要政党——共和党与民主党——在外交政治问题立场上的重要变化。美国孤立主义的反动派，当他们提出了新计划时，他们已转到积极扩张政策的统治上去，确定其任务为建立美国在全世界的统治，这就是范登堡及其门徒的方针。人们不能不认识到罗斯福死后孤立主义领袖与共和党及民主党某些领导集团间外交政策的观点，已趋于接近。真理报结论称：在建立世界广大基地网方面的活动，证明与扩展主义相连系的倾向，目前在外交政策范围内占了上风，此种倾向为二十世纪的帝国主义。红星报指出：前进航空基地问题，是国际关系中的新因素，并力称美国基地网计划将引起美英两国利益间的冲突，因为美国追求的不仅是保留，而且是扩张其基地网，特别是在近东与中东的基地网。
