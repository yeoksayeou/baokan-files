　　政民人员退休仍能各得其所
    边府规定退休办法
    【本报讯】边区政府为妥善照顾政民人员退休后，能安家生产，各得其所，各尽所能，特颁发政民工作人员退休办法，其要点如次：
    一、政民人员退休时，应按其参加工作年限之长短，发给生产补助粮，其标准数目规定如下：
    １、参加工作半年至一年者发给小米一百三十斤，一年零一个月者发给小米一百三十七斤，每增一月即增发七斤。
    ２、三年者发给小米三百二十二斤，三年零一个月者发给小米三百三十五斤，每增一月即增发十三斤。
    ３、八年者发给小米一千二百三十二斤，八年以上者，可斟酌情形发给小米一千三百斤至一千六百斤。
    二、政民人员之工作年限，以连续服务计算，因病休养者不以工作中断论，由部队转入政民机关团体者其在部队之工作年限，应计算在内。
    三、凡复员退休之政民人员，除发给生产补助粮及复员退休证外，并应按路途远近，由其供职机关发给回乡路费、粮票、菜金及退休前应领之服装、鞋、袜等。其路程每日按六十里计算，路远不适用粮票者，折发粮款，生产补助粮由县以上政府核发，从社会事业费内报销。如系转业者，只发转业证，不发生产补助粮等。
    四、政民人员在抗战中，因战争负伤以致残废者，对其安置，声援照荣誉军人安置及优恤暂行条例处理之。其家属贫寒无劳动力者，按政民人员贫寒家属救济办法酌情救济之。
