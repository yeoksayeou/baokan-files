            Paris Foreign Ministers Conference
    The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, which opened in Paris on April 25th and lasted for three weeks, adjourned on the 16th of this month and decided to reconvene on the 16th of next month.
    This Four Foreign Ministers Conference reached agreements on certain issues, such as the Finnish peace treaty, the ×× border, and the borders of Bulgaria. Agreements were also largely reached on the preamble to the Italian peace treaty and the handling of the Italian fleet.
    However, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference still failed to reach agreements on several other important issues. Therefore, this conference could not complete the task set by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference at the end of last year, which was for the four powers to reach a common agreement on the draft peace treaties for Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and then submit these drafts to the Paris Peace Conference, which would be composed of twenty-one countries, for approval. The completion of this task still depends on the continued discussions of the four foreign ministers' assistants currently staying in Paris and the reconvening of the four foreign ministers on the 16th of next month.
    The focal points of contention at this Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, to name the main ones, were the Trieste issue and the handling of Italian colonies. In addition, as the conference was about to conclude, the US side proposed submitting the issues already decided and undecided by the Foreign Ministers Conference to the Peace Conference for discussion, as it estimated that fifteen or sixteen of the twenty-one countries participating in the Peace Conference would side with the United States. Regarding this issue, the Soviet Union, based on the decision of the Moscow Conference at the end of last year, insisted that the four powers must reach an agreement on all major issues before the Peace Conference is held. This proposal by the Soviet Union was finally approved by the conference.
    Looking at this Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, although it did not resolve issues as smoothly as the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference at the end of last year, it was also very different from the London Foreign Ministers Conference in September last year, which ended without results. Several points about this Paris Foreign Ministers Conference are worth noting: First, the main disputes at this conference occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union, rather than between Britain and the Soviet Union as in the London Conference. Second, the differences between the United States and Britain became increasingly apparent. Regarding the handling of Italian colonies, the differences between Britain and the United States became even more obvious after the Soviet Union expressed concessions. Third, although the debates at this conference were fierce, the atmosphere was relatively relaxed, leaving room for mediation, and agreements were reached on some issues.
    Therefore, there is still hope that the issues not resolved at this conference will be agreed upon when the conference reopens on the 16th of next month, because in the near future, the Peace Conference will eventually be held, and the peace treaties for Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Italy will eventually be signed.
            Anglo-American Relations
    The US Senate passed a $3.748 billion loan to Britain on the 10th of this month. This does not mean that the contradictions between Britain and the United States (the two major countries in the capitalist system) in the post-war world economic sphere have weakened. On the contrary, these contradictions will become increasingly acute, because the purpose of this loan by the United States, as US Secretary of State Byrnes said on the 16th of last month, "is not for the revival of Britain." As conditions for the loan to Britain, the United States insisted that Britain make many economic concessions, such as abandoning imperial preference, abolishing the sterling area, removing tariff barriers, etc. This allows US capital to penetrate areas within Britain's sphere of influence, which will inevitably cause fierce resistance from the British side. Because Britain consumed most of its overseas investment in this war, if it wants to import the food and raw materials necessary to restore its pre-war living standards every year after the war, it needs to increase its pre-war exports by 50%, that is, it needs a larger world market than in the past. Therefore, Britain has to engage in fierce competition with the United States worldwide. Britain made such painful concessions and humbled itself in this loan (even British nobles enthusiastically agreed to lend the Magna Carta of 1215, which has always been regarded as a "national treasure," to the United States to show "friendship"), simply because it could not obtain the loan otherwise, and without this loan, it would be extremely difficult for Britain to recover from the wounds of the war. The Labor government, representing the British Empire, deeply feels the huge difficulties of Britain's post-war transition period, and hopes that in the near future, after receiving tens of billions of dollars in funding to reorganize its forces, it will be able to deal with the United States; and on the US side, it also needs the world market. Its post-war annual exports cannot be satisfied with a slight increase over the pre-war amount (4 to 5 billion US dollars), but must be two or even three times the pre-war amount, otherwise an economic crisis of overproduction will occur. This is the basis for the increasingly fierce struggle between Britain and the United States for the world market after the war.
    Even now, many facts show that Anglo-American contradictions have gradually increased since the end of the war. Even when the US Senate was discussing the loan to Britain, isolationist senators strongly opposed the loan. The debate lasted for four weeks, and as many as 34 voted against it. American isolationists such as Hurley, Taft, and Hoover dream of America's world hegemony, hoping to take advantage of Britain's post-war fatigue, take all of Britain's markets, and subdue Britain to become America's "economic appendage" without providing any assistance. In fact, American capital is currently actively penetrating and operating within Britain's sphere of influence, trying to squeeze out Britain. The investment of American oil companies and airlines in the Middle East is greatly increasing, and London newspapers are extremely dissatisfied with this. The United States has now broken the Anglo-Siamese Economic Agreement that Britain wanted to monopolize Siam and signed an Anglo-American-Siamese Economic Agreement. The United States is now using the famine in Britain and its territories as a weapon to pressure Britain to make new economic concessions, and even since Japan's surrender, the United States has stopped providing Britain with information on the development of atomic energy. This is also the reason why some British figures (such as Laski) have recently accused the United States of monopolizing the technical secrets of atomic energy and demanded international co-management. In other respects, there are also disputes between Britain and the United States, such as the United States' efforts to occupy British bases where US troops were stationed during the war, especially British islands in the Pacific. This has recently occupied the front pages of British newspapers, with articles opposing this move by the United States as "imperialist expansion." In the Allied Council for Japan, the British representative is also similarly dissatisfied with MacArthur's arbitrary actions.
            The Course of the Japanese Cabinet Crisis
    The Japanese cabinet crisis, after several twists and turns, has now come to a temporary end as Yoshida, the new president of the Liberal Party, has been ordered to form a cabinet.
    This cabinet crisis began after the general election on the 10th of last month. Due to the results of the "general election," the power of various factions of the Japanese ruling class has changed. The Liberal Party, mainly backed by the Mitsui zaibatsu, holds the first party position in the new parliament. The party had formed an alliance with Shidehara to take charge of the general election. After the general election, this alliance broke down due to the struggle for power and profit. At that time, the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan successively convened meetings, and representatives from the Soviet Union, New Zealand, Australia, and other Allied countries criticized the Shidehara cabinet without reservation. Therefore, the Shidehara cabinet was forced to resign en masse on the 22nd of last month.
    After Shidehara's downfall, fierce struggles broke out within Japan over the issue of forming a cabinet. First, there was the struggle between the forces of the democratic front and the forces of the anti-democratic front. Democratic parties led by the Japanese Communist Party and Katō Kanjū, the leader of the left wing of the Socialist Party, demanded the establishment of a democratic coalition government; while anti-democratic parties plotted to organize a reactionary coalition cabinet to resist democratic forces. Among the various reactionary factions, the struggle for cabinet positions unfolded. At that time, there was the Shidehara faction, plotting to cling to power and win over the Progressive Party, opposing the Liberal Party (the background of which was the struggle between the Mitsubishi zaibatsu and the Mitsui zaibatsu); some members of the right wing of the Socialist Party united with the Liberal Party to oppose Shidehara; another part of the right wing of the Socialist Party colluded with a part of the National Cooperative Party representing the large landlords in the northeast to oppose the Liberal Party; the Liberal Party courted members of the National Cooperative Party representing landlords in Kanto and Kansai (who have connections with industry) to oppose the Shidehara faction and the Progressive Party.
    The infighting among the Japanese reactionary forces also gave the democratic forces favorable conditions for development. Therefore, cunning bureaucrats in the ruling class believed that it was necessary to step forward to mediate and make the reactionary factions re-compromise; at the same time, MacArthur stated that "the chaos of cabinet formation must not continue." On the 29th of last month, Matsumoto Tsuneo, a senior official in the Japanese imperial court, acted as a "peacemaker" and worked hard to mediate. On the 4th of this month, it was decided that Hatoyama would form a single-party cabinet.
    However, because the Japanese people and Allied public opinion had continuously exposed Hatoyama's democratic disguise for a long time, and the Allied representatives in the Allied Council for Japan had also criticized Hatoyama's cabinet formation plot, MacArthur rejected the Emperor's request to appoint Hatoyama to form a cabinet on the 4th of this month. Therefore, Shidehara was forced to recommend Katayama Tetsu, the secretary of the Socialist Party, to succeed him in forming a cabinet.
    When Shidehara recommended Katayama, he initially attempted to use Katayama as a guise to form a reactionary cabinet, thereby deceiving the Allied countries and deceiving the people at home. However, Katayama is a middle-of-the-road figure in the Socialist Party. The left and right wings of the party are evenly matched. The left wing strongly advocates the establishment of a coalition cabinet with the Japanese Communist Party and other democratic parties; the right wing tries to exclude the Japanese Communist Party and form an anti-democratic coalition cabinet with reactionary leaders such as the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, putting Katayama in a dilemma. At this time, the Japanese Communist Party and the broad masses of the people actively urged Katayama to form a democratic government. The Japanese ruling class deeply feared "lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet." On the one hand, they made the Emperor delay formally authorizing Katayama to form a cabinet, and on the other hand, they convened a conference of various reactionary factions to resist the democratic forces.
    The internal compromise of the Japanese ruling class proceeded in two directions: one was within the Liberal Party. After Hatoyama was deposed, the party split into three factions (namely, the Hatoyama faction, the Ashida faction, and the Yoshida faction), vying for the leadership of the party. Finally, the internal strife was temporarily quelled with Yoshida being elected as president; the other was that through the activities of Shidehara, Yoshida, and Matsumoto, the three major parties of the Japanese ruling class—the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the National Cooperative Party—also temporarily eased their mutual infighting. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, the Emperor authorized Yoshida to form a cabinet. Yoshida is not only the president of the Liberal Party, which mainly represents Mitsui's interests, but also a figure who communicates with Mitsubishi's agent Shidehara and the Progressive Party, and a diplomatic bureaucrat who had a relationship with British and American appeasers. It can be predicted that the new Japanese cabinet headed by Yoshida will be a coalition cabinet of various Japanese reactionary parties. In the future, the struggle between the democratic front and the anti-democratic front in Japan will become more acute. The demonstrations by the masses in Tokyo against Yoshida's cabinet formation were the beginning of this.

　　国际述评
            巴黎外长会议
    四月二十五日，在巴黎召开的四强外长会议，历时三周，已于本月十六日宣告休会，并决定于下月十六日再行召集。
    这次四外长会议，曾在某些问题上取得了协议，例如在芬兰和约、××边界、保国疆界等问题上，会议皆曾获得协议，而在对意和约序言及处理意大利舰队上，也大致取得协议。
    但是，四外长会议在另外几个重要问题上，仍然未获协议，因而这次会议还不能完成去年底莫斯科三外长会议所规定的任务，就是由四强取得关于意、罗、保、匈、芬诸国的和约草案的共同协议，然后再将这些草案提交将由二十一国组成的巴黎和会通过，这一任务的完成，尚有待于目前留在巴黎的四国外长助理的继续商讨，与下月十六日四外长的再次会议。
    这次巴黎外长会议的争执焦点，举其要者，有的里雅斯特问题，及意殖民地的处理问题。此外，在会议将完之时，美方曾提出将外长会议已决及未决问题提交和会讨论，因为它估计到参加和会的二十一国中，有十五六国会站在美国方面。关于这个问题，苏联根据去年底莫斯科会议决定，坚主在和会举行以前，四强对于各项重大问题，必须获致协议。苏联这一主张，终于获得会议的赞同。
    综观这次巴黎四外长会议，虽然未能如去年底莫斯科三外长会议的顺利解决问题，但也和去年九月无结果而散的伦敦外长会议大有不同。关于这次巴黎外长会议有几点值得注意：第一，这次会议的主要争执，发生于美苏之间，而不象伦敦会议中，乃是英苏发生争论。第二，美英之间分歧日趋明显，关于意大利殖民地处理问题，在苏联表示让步之后，英美的分歧更是显而易见。第三，这次会议争论虽然剧烈，但是气氛较为缓和，留有斡旋余地，并且在某些问题上，也曾获得协议。
    因此，这次会议所未曾解决的问题，在下月十六日会议重开之时，仍然有获得协议的希望，因为在不久的将来，和会终究是要召开的，对芬、罗、保、匈、意的和约，也终究是要签订的。
            英美关系
    本月十日美国参院通过了三十七亿四千八百万美元的对英贷款，这并不意味着英美（资本主义体系中的两大国）在战后世界经济领域内的矛盾减弱了，相反的，这种矛盾将愈趋尖锐，因为美国这一贷款的目的，如美国务卿贝纳斯于上月十六日所说的，“并不是为了英国复兴”，作为对英贷款的条件，美国坚持要英国作许多经济让步，如各方所传的放弃帝国优先权，废止英镑集团，撤除关税壁垒等等，这就使美国资本能够渗入属于英国势力范围的地区，其结果必然引起英国方面的剧烈的抗拒。因为英国在这次战争中消耗了海外投资的大部，如果在战后要每年输入供其恢复战前生活水平所必须的食粮和原料，就要增加其战前输出的百分之五十，也就是说，需要比过去更广大的世界市场，因而英国就不得不在全世界范围内，对美国作剧烈的竞争。英国在这次贷款中之所以如此忍痛让步，低声下气（甚至英国的贵族亦竟热烈地赞成将一向被视为“国宝”的一二一五年自由大宪章借给美国，以示“友好”），无非是因为非此不能得到贷款，而没有这笔贷款，英国就极难使其战争的创伤恢复过来。代表大英帝国的工党政府，深深感到英国战后过渡时期的巨大困难，而指望着在不久的将来，在得到数十亿美元的挹注而重整旗鼓之后，能与美国相周旋；而在美国方面，它亦需要世界市场。它的战后每年输出，决不能比战前的数额（四十至五十亿美元）稍为增加就会满足，而必须两倍以至三倍于战前，否则就发生生产过剩的经济危机。这就是战后英美为角逐世界市场的斗争，将愈趋激烈的根据。
    即使在目前许多事实，也显示着英美矛盾已随战争结束而日渐增长，就是在美参院讨论对英贷款时，孤立派的参议员极力反对贷款，争论历时四周之久，投票反对者竟达三十四票之多。美国孤立分子如赫尔利、塔虎特、胡佛之流，憧憬着美国的世界霸权，盼不得乘英国战后疲敝之际，尽取英国的市场，压服英国成为美国的“经济尾闾”，而不给以任何援助。事实上，美国资本目前正积极的渗入英国势力范围内活动，千方百计地排挤英国，美国的石油公司和航空公司在中东的投资正大大的增长中，伦敦报纸对此已异常不满。美国目前已打破英国要独占暹罗的英暹经济协定，而订立英美暹三国经济协定。美国现正利用英国及其所辖地区的粮荒，以救济作为压迫英国作新的经济让步的武器，甚至自日本投降以后，美国已停止供给英国关于原子能发展的情报，这也是近来英国若干人物（如拉斯基等）责备美国垄断原子能的技术秘密而要求国际共管的缘因。在其他方面，英美中间也存在着争端，如美国力图霸占在战争中有美军驻扎的英国基地，特别在太平洋上的英属岛屿，这在最近已占英国报纸的首页地位，并有著文反对，形容美国此举为“帝国主义扩张”者。在盟国对日委员会上，英国代表亦同样不满麦克阿瑟的独断独行。
            日本阁潮的经过
    日本的阁潮，经过了几度风波之后，目前已因自由党新总裁吉田受命组阁而暂告结束了。
    这次阁潮是在上月十日的大选之后开始的，由于“大选”的结果，日本统治阶级各派的势力有所消长，以三井财阀为主要背景的自由党占有新议会的第一党地位，该党曾与币原结成同盟，包办大选，在大选后，这一同盟就因争权夺利而告破裂，而远东委员会、对日委员会又于当时相继集会，苏、纽、澳等盟国代表，抨击币原内阁不遗余力，于是币原内阁被迫于上月二十二日总辞职了。
    币原垮台后，环绕着组阁问题，日本国内即掀起激烈的斗争，首先是民主阵线势力与反民主阵线势力的斗争。以日共与社会党左派领袖加藤勘十等为首的民主党派，要求成立民主联合政府；而反民主党派策动组织反动派联合内阁，以抵制民主势力。此次各反动派内部，因争夺内阁地盘而展开的斗争，当时有币原一派，阴谋恋栈而拉拢进步党，反对自由党的斗争（其背景是三菱财阀与三井财阀之间的斗争）；有社会党右派一部分分子联合自由党，反对币原的斗争；有社会党右派另一部分分子，与国民协同党中代表东北部们大地主的部分相勾结，以反对自由党的斗争；有自由党笼络国民协同党中代表关东、关西地主（他与工业有联系）的分子，反对币原一派和进步党的斗争。
    日本反动势力内部的斗争，也给了民主势力发展以有利条件，所以，统治阶级中老练狡猾的官僚，便认为有出面调停使反动派内部重谋妥协的必要；同时麦克阿瑟对于日本统治阶级内部的斗争，曾表示“组阁的混乱不容再继续下去。”到了上月二十九日，日本宫庭大官僚松本恒雄，即以“和事佬”自居而奔走折冲。至本月四号，便决定由鸠山成立一党内阁。
    可是，因为日本人民与盟国舆论，许久以来对鸠山的民主伪装不断予以揭发，而对日委员会中盟国代表也曾抨击鸠山组阁阴谋，麦克阿瑟乃于本月四日当天否决日皇任命鸠山组阁的呈请，于是币原被迫推荐社会党书记片山哲继起组阁。
    币原推荐片山时，最初曾企图以片山为幌子，成立反动内阁，借此既能蒙蔽盟国，又可欺骗国内人民。但是片山为社会党内中派人物，该党左右翼势均力敌，左派力主与日共等民主党派成立联合内阁；右派则力图排挤日共，而与自由党、进步党等反动领袖成立反民主的联合内阁，使片山处于左右为难的境地，而日共与广大人民，此时则积极敦促片山成立民主政府。日本统治阶级深恐“搬起石头打自己的脚”，乃一方面使日皇迟迟不正式授命片山组阁，另一方面并召开各反动派的大会，以抗拒民主势力。
    日本统治阶级的内部妥协，沿两个方向进行：一个是在自由党内部，该党以鸠山被黜后，曾分裂为三派（即鸠山派、芦田派、吉田派），争夺党的领导权，终于以吉田被推为总裁而暂息内争；另一个是经过币原、吉田与松本的活动，日本统治阶级三大党——自由党、进步党与国民协同党之间，也暂时缓和了相互倾轧，于是本月十六日日皇乃授命吉田组阁。吉田既是主要代表三井利益的自由党的总裁，又是与三菱代理人币原及进步党互通声气的人物，而且是与英美绥靖主义者们有过一段瓜葛的外交官僚。可以预计，以吉田为首的日本新阁，将是日本各反动党派的联合内阁。今后日本国内民主阵线与反民主阵线的斗争，必将更加尖锐起来，日本东京群众示威反对吉田组阁，即为其肇始。
