　　Kuomintang Planes Scourge and Disturb
    Actually Invading Our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Fu County Dispatch: On the morning of the 15th of this month, a Kuomintang "911" twin-engine aircraft intruded into Sixian Village on the border of Fu County in our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. It circled at low altitude for reconnaissance, and then strafed with machine guns. Afterwards, the plane passed through areas such as Zhangcunyi and Zhiluozhen, and fled southwest. It is reported that in the past ten days, the scope of aircraft used by the Kuomintang reactionaries has been expanding daily. The front lines of Siping in the Northeast and along the railways, Huai'an and Huaiyin in Central Jiangsu, Botou in Central Hebei, and Zuoyun in Northwest Shanxi have all been subjected to aircraft harassment and strafing. Now, they have even invaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, where the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is located. The military supplies manufactured with the blood and sweat of American workers are unfortunately being used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to slaughter peaceful residents, expand the civil war, and create chaos in China. It is hoped that the American working class and democrats who sympathize with China will take action to stop this.

　　国民党飞机四出窜扰
    竟侵入我陕甘宁边区
    【新华社延安十九日电】鄜县讯：本月十五日上午国民党“九一一”双引擎飞机一架，窜入我陕甘宁边区鄜县边境四仙村，低空盘旋侦察，继以机枪扫射，其后该机经张村驿、直罗镇等地区，向西南逸去。按旬日以来，国民党反动派使用飞机范围已日益扩大，东北的四平前线和铁路沿线，苏中的淮安、淮阴，冀中的泊头，晋西北的左云，均遭到飞机的骚扰和扫射，而现竟侵入中共中央所在地的陕甘宁边区，美国工人血汗制造的军火，不幸被国民党反动派利用以残杀和平居民，扩大内战，造成中国的混乱，希望同情中国的美国工人阶级和民主人士加以制止。
