    Promotes New Spinning Wheels
    [Julu News] The military, government, and civilian organizations of Julu County, Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region, jointly organized an iron and wood factory, producing a batch of new-style spinning wheels. Some produce twelve strands of thread, some produce twenty strands of thread, some are hand-cranked, and some are foot-pedaled. The spun thread is fine and even, and the output is four to five times higher than that of old-style spinning wheels. Preparations are now underway for widespread promotion. (Bu)
