　　Allied Council for Japan Holds Fourth Meeting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Tokyo dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan held its fourth meeting on the 15th. At the meeting, the Soviet and British representatives raised serious questions regarding the underground activities of Japanese fascists. The Soviet representative, Deleianko, cited many facts to illustrate the conspiracies of Japanese veterans engaged in various underground activities. The British and Chinese representatives also questioned based on factual evidence. Intelligence officials from MacArthur's headquarters admitted to these facts but stated that there were no widespread underground activities. At the meeting, Deleianko also proposed that MacArthur's directives should be submitted to the council at least eighteen hours before their promulgation. The British representative proposed a compromise suggestion that the council be given a "hint" before the directives were issued so that they could be studied, but this was rejected by MacArthur's representative, Acheson.

　　盟国对日委会开第四次会议
    【新华社延安十七日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会十五日举行第四次会议，会上苏英代表对日本法西斯地下活动问题，提出严重质问。苏代表德勒扬哥引据许多事实，说明日退伍军官从事种种地下活动的阴谋，英国与中国代表亦引据实事质问，麦克阿瑟总部情报官员承认有此事实，但并无广泛的地下活动。会上德勒扬哥并提议麦克阿瑟指令，应在其颁布前十八小时以上时间交给委员会。英代表提出妥协建议，在指令颁发前，先予委员会以“暗示”，俾能有所研究，但均遭麦克阿瑟代表阿契生之拒绝。
