　　Border Region Coal Industry Conference
    Rong Vice Chairman Instructs on the Direction of the Coal Industry
    Large and Small Mines Learn from Each Other, Improve Technology, and Lay the Foundation for Industrialization.
    [Our Newspaper] At the Border Region Coal Industry Conference held in Fengfeng, Cixian County, at the beginning of the month, mine owners and employee representatives from the Taihang and Taiyue mining areas thoroughly discussed various issues in the future development of the coal industry in the entire region. Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government, based on the discussions at the conference, made a concluding speech, which pointed out that the coal reserves on both the east and west sides of Taihang are extremely rich. Some mining areas have already adopted new mining methods, enabling the output of mines to gradually exceed the level during the enemy-occupied period. Jiao Zuo has even caught up to the pre-war level. Therefore, the future direction of coal industry development, for these large mining areas, should be to intensify the study of science and accumulate experience on the current basis, in order to move forward a step further and lay the foundation for the industrialization of the liberated areas. For semi-mechanized kilns scattered in various places, the main task is to accumulate capital, cultivate talent, and improve technology, preparing to develop towards mechanized kiln production methods. Large and small kilns should help each other and learn from each other, especially large kilns should frequently help the development of small kilns with talent and surplus machinery. In terms of coal industry management methods, most of the mines in the entire region adopt several methods: private operation, joint public-private operation, and cooperation between government organizations. In the future, we must develop towards enterprise-based and rationalized methods and must change the practices of being government organization-based and group-based. In the company's organizational leadership, we must do a better job of achieving strict division of labor, precise calculation, and fully exerting the role of "everyone doing their best, everything being used, and every moment being valued." In terms of wages, industrial workers should be paid higher than rural workers, miners should be paid higher than general handicraft workers, machine workers' wages should generally be higher than manual workers, and specialized technical personnel should receive special treatment. Technical employees who concurrently serve as administrative cadres should receive both technical wages and a supplement of administrative staff salaries. During the eight-year war, the number of worker deaths was extremely large. In the future, the democratic government should work with trade unions and companies to recruit a large number of workers, and launch a campaign for demobilized soldiers to participate in industrial production in large numbers. Finally, everyone unanimously believed that the development of the coal industry in the border region in the future must implement the principle of labor-capital cooperation, so that workers' lives can be improved, coal capitalists can also benefit, and everyone can work together to double their efforts for the construction of the coal industry in the border region.

　　边区煤业会议上
    戎副主席指示煤业方向
    大窑小窑互相学习，提高技术，奠定工业化基础。
    【本报讯】月初于磁县峰峰举行之边区煤业会议上，太行、太岳各矿区窑主、各职工代表，详细讨论了今后全区煤业发展中的诸问题。边区政府戎副主席，并根据大会讨论作了总结发言，该总结指出：太行东西两侧，煤藏极富，有些矿区已使用新式开采法，使矿山生产量，逐渐超过敌占时水平，焦作并已赶上战前水平。因之今后煤业发展方向，对这些大矿区，应在目前的基础上，加紧学习科学，积累经验，以更向前提高一步，奠定解放区工业化的基础。对散布各地的半机器窑，则主要是积蓄资本，培养人材，提高技术，准备向机器窑生产方式发展，大窑小窑两窑应互相帮助，互相学习，特别是大窑应经常以人材、剩余机器帮助小窑的发展。在煤业经营方式上，全区大部矿山，都是采取私营、公私合营与机关团体合作经营几种方式。今后更要向企业化合理化方面发展，必须改变机关化，团体化的作法。在公司组织领导上，更好的作到严密分工，精确计算，充分发挥“人尽其能，物尽其用，时尽其值”的作用。在工资方面，产业工人应高于农村工人，矿工应高于一般手工业工人，机器工人工资，一般应高于劳力工人，专门技术人材，应有特别待遇，部分兼任行政干部的技术职工，除发技术工资外，还应增发一部行政职员薪金。在八年战争中，工人死亡数目极大，今后民主政府应协同工会公司大量募招工人，并发动复员士兵大量参加工业生产。最后，大家一致认为今后边区煤业的发展，必须贯彻劳资合作方针，使工人生活得以改善，煤业资本家亦有利可图，大家同心协力，为边区煤业建设而加倍努力。
