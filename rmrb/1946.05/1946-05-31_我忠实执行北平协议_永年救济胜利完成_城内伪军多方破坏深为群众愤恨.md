　　I Faithfully Implement the Beiping Agreement
    Yongnian Relief Successfully Completed
    Puppet Troops in the City Cause Much Damage, Deeply Resented by the Masses
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Zhang Baiyuan, representative of the Border Region Relief Branch, and Mr. Heng Anshi, representative of UNRRA, and Mr. Zhang Manyou, representative of CNRRA, signed an agreement in Beiping on April 26 regarding relief for refugees in Yongnian. The Border Region Assembly has fully implemented it and has also helped to resolve the 8 million 法币 (fǎbì, legal tender) for transportation costs in addition to the agreement. The materials that CNRRA and UNRRA should have exchanged according to the agreement have not yet been delivered. The disaster victims in the Liberated Areas have also not been relieved. Mr. Zhao Wei, representative of the branch here, raised these two issues with the UNRRA negotiation representative, urging them to be realized in the short term. Chairman Yang of the Border Government hosted a banquet at noon on the 28th of this month to entertain the representatives of the three parties who completed the distribution of relief grain in Yongnian.
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The relief team jointly organized by the representatives of UNRRA, CNRRA, and the Liberated Area Relief Committee began working in and outside Yongnian city on May 1. As of the 23rd, the original plan to distribute 300,000 catties of grain was finally completed. The distribution outside the city was the responsibility of the Liberated Area Relief Committee, with UNRRA and CNRRA representatives participating. Refugees who escaped from Yongnian city, except for a portion who moved to distant places for employment, were scattered in 181 villages in Yongnian, Handan, and other places. 6,422 people who were registered and verified have received grain. The distribution inside the city was the responsibility of UNRRA and CNRRA representatives, with representatives from the Liberated Area Relief Committee participating. The puppet troops entrenched in the city repeatedly falsely reported the number of refugees. The Liberated Area Relief Committee representative advocated submitting the refugee registration books inside and outside the city for review by the refugees inside and outside the city. In desperation, the puppet troops threatened to deny relief and refused to review. Our representative, considering the urgent need for relief among the refugees in the city, agreed to issue grain according to their falsely reported list of 6,498 people, and reluctantly tolerated the puppet troops' fraudulently obtained portion of the grain. On the 19th, when Li Xia, the representative of the Liberated Area, was conducting relief in the city, the puppet troops openly insulted him. The next day, when our representative was distributing grain in the streets, he exposed the puppet troops' conspiracy to defraud grain and their ugly behavior of insulting relief personnel to the masses. The masses were extremely indignant and deeply grateful for our side's concern for the people's suffering.

　　我忠实执行北平协议
    永年救济胜利完成
    城内伪军多方破坏深为群众愤恨
    【本报讯】四月二十六日边区救济分会代表张柏园氏与联总代表恒安石、行总代表张蔓友先生在北平签订之救济永年的难民协议，边区议会已完满执行；且于协议之外帮助解决八百万元法币的运输费。协议中规定之行总联总应交换之物资至今尚未交付。解放区之灾民亦尚未救济。此间分会代表赵为一先生、向联总协议代表提出，促其以上两问题，于短期内实现。边府杨主席于本月二十八日午设宴招待此次完成永年发放救济粮工作之三方代表。
    【本报讯】联总行行总及解放区救委会三方代表共同组织之救济小组，自五月一日起在永年城内外开始工作，截至廿三日止，终于完成原定三十万斤粮食之发放，城外发放由解放区救委会负责，联总、行总代表参加，由永年城内逃出之难民，除一部分移至远处就业者外，散处永年、邯郸等地一百八十一个村庄之六千四百二十二人经登记审查后，均已领得粮食。城内由联总、行总代表负责，由解放区救委会代表参加，盘踞该城之伪军一再谎报难民人数，解放区救委会代表主张将城内外难民登记册交予城内外难民审查，伪军情急，乃以不准救济为威胁，拒绝审查，我代表因顾念城内难民急待救济，乃同意按其虚报名册六千四百九十八人发粮，对伪军骗取部分粮食曲意容忍，乃十九日解放区代表李夏在城内进行救济时，伪军竟大肆辱骂，次日我代表在各街发放粮食时，向群众揭露伪军骗粮阴谋，及辱骂救济人员之丑恶行为，群众均万分愤恨，而对我方为人民之苦心，深表感激。
