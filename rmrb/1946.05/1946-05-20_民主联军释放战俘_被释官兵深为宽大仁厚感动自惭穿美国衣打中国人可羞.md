　　Democratic Allied Forces Release Prisoners of War
    Released Officers and Soldiers Deeply Moved by Generosity and Benevolence, Ashamed of Wearing American Clothes to Fight Chinese People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 16th] The Front Headquarters of the Democratic Allied Forces recently held a farewell meeting for captured Kuomintang military officers returning to their units. A symposium was held on the battlefield, attended by more than ten Kuomintang military officers of platoon level and above. During the symposium, Wang Huamin, a senior Kuomintang military colonel and staff officer, said, "After I was captured, I thought I was a prisoner, but who knew I would become an honored guest." He was deeply moved by the generosity and benevolence of the Democratic Allied Forces. Then, he said with shame, "I was dissatisfied with three things there: First, the Baojia system and the unequal conscription system, where wealthy families with five brothers would not be drafted, while the only son of poor families would be drafted; second, the abuse of force, which was nicely called 'taking over' this time, but was actually fighting a civil war; third, economic control, where bureaucratic capital monopolized everything, the legal tender depreciated, prices soared, and the people were in dire straits." Then, Sun Chengwu, a sergeant platoon deputy, said painfully, "I was forcibly conscripted into the army in 1938. This time we were sent to Xinmin County, and only then did we hear from our superiors that there were too many bandits to eliminate, but after we inquired, we learned that they were the patriotic and people-loving Eighth Route Army, so many brothers were unwilling to fight." Wang Ruifang, a student-turned-20-year-old lieutenant platoon leader, said, "When we engaged with you, knowing that you were the Eighth Route Army, my courage disappeared." He said angrily, "I hope to go home. If you need us to defend peace, I will resolutely work here." Peng Jinrong, the acting platoon leader, said painfully, "It is most shameful for Chinese people to take American weapons, wear American clothes, and fight Chinese people!" Peng Zhiyuan, a lieutenant company deputy, explained more sincerely, "The country needs peace, democracy, and unity, but the Kuomintang reactionaries want to fight a civil war." Xu Shuyan, a second lieutenant platoon leader, said, "We are unwilling to shed blood for personal conspiracies." A total of eight officers were bidden farewell on this occasion, expressing their gratitude to the Democratic Allied Forces before their departure and saying that they must act according to their conscience in the future and never fight a civil war again.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 17th] After the Kuomintang reactionaries seized Anshan, they appointed Zou Chengqing, a habitual bandit nicknamed "Chicken Killing King," as the mayor of Anshan City. After seizing Tai'an, they appointed Yan Sanhu, nicknamed "Wild Dragon," as the captain of Tai'an. When seizing Liaozhong, they used Japanese soldiers and bandits as vanguards. According to people who fled from Liaozhong County, when the Kuomintang reactionaries entered the city, the front was led by more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, the middle was led by Zhou Zhongsheng, a habitual bandit, with more than one hundred bandits, and the rear was the so-called "Central Army." Wherever they went, they committed rape, plunder, arson, and murder, doing everything evil.

　　民主联军释放战俘
    被释官兵深为宽大仁厚感动自惭穿美国衣打中国人可羞
    【新华社四平街十六日电】民主联军前方总司令部，日前欢送被俘国民党军官返部，并在战地召开座谈会，到国民党军排级以上军官十余人。座谈中，国民党军上校高级参谋王化民说：“我被俘以后，以为是阶下囚，谁知成为座上客。”民主联军的宽大仁厚深深地感动了他。接着，他惭愧地说：“我在那里不满意的有三点：第一是保甲制和不平等的征兵制，有钱人家五个弟兄也不抽，穷人家的独子也要抽去；第二是滥用武力，这次说得好听是“接收”，实际是打内战；第三是经济统制，官僚资本独占一切，法币跌价，百物腾贵，民不聊生。”接着上士排副孙成五沉痛地说：“我是民国二十七年被抓当兵的，这次我们被开到新民县，才听上级说土匪太多，要消灭，但是我们打听一下，才知道是爱国爱民的八路军，于是许多弟兄都不愿意打仗了”。中尉排长王瑞芳是一个学生出身的二十岁的青年，他说：“与你们接战时，知道你们是八路军，我的勇气就消失了。”他非常气愤地说：“我希望回家，你们为了保卫和平，如果需要我们，我就坚决在这里干。”代理排长彭金荣沉痛地说：“中国人拿美国武器，穿美国衣服，来打中国人，是最羞耻的！”中尉连副彭志远更诚恳地说明：“国内需要和平民主统一，国民党反动派他们要打内战。”少尉排长徐树燕说：“我们不愿为个人阴谋而流血。”此次被欢送回部军官共八人，临行对民主联军表示感谢，并说今后一定要凭良心作事，决不再打内战。
    【新华社长春十七日电】国民党反动派抢占鞍山后，即委任惯匪绰号“杀鸡王”的邹成清为鞍山市的市长，抢占台安后，即委任绰号“野龙”的严三虎为台安大队长，而在抢占辽中时，更以日军和土匪作先锋。据辽中县逃来人士谈：国民党反动派进城时，最前面是二百多个日军，中间是惯匪周中生率领的一百多个土匪，最后才是所谓“中央军”，所到之处，奸淫掳掠烧杀，无所不为。
