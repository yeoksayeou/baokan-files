　　Elementary Schools in Southern Hebei
    Combining Study and Production
    Female Students at Peizhuang Elementary School Earn 4,000 Yuan Silver Dollars in Two Months Through Weaving
    [Our Southern Hebei Correspondent] Elementary schools in southern Hebei, under the policy of closely integrating education and production, have enthusiastically joined the production movement. Teachers personally participate and provide constant leadership, while students actively participate in production, organizing manure collection groups, thread reeling groups, ribbon weaving groups, salt leaching groups, firewood gathering groups, cotton spinning groups, plowing groups, and millstone pushing groups, showing great enthusiasm. At Pan Village Elementary School in Wei County, the half-catty of hemp seeds and thirty willow trees planted around the school buildings were used as teaching materials in the planting process, explaining the uses and planting methods of hemp seeds and willow trees. At the same time, their studies were not affected by production. Students often brought books to the fields, discussing and studying with each other while walking. If they forgot something, they would take out their books. They not only completed school production tasks but also helped families of soldiers and martyrs by collecting manure and firewood. They also fulfilled their responsibilities in assisting with household production. At Ji'ze's Yingcheng Elementary School, students organized mutual aid groups to help families with production. At Julu's First Complete Elementary School, more than twenty female students have already started weaving cloth, weaving one bolt a day, earning 290 yuan silver dollars. Female students at Gaotang's Peizhuang Elementary School have earned more than 4,700 yuan in two months of weaving, and the profits have been deposited into the cooperative to help solve part of the family's production needs. Their parents happily say, "At first, we used to take money to the school, but now we are bringing money home." The border region's elementary education has been able to consolidate and continuously develop during the eight years of the War of Resistance and the four years of famine because, under the slogan of "combining study and production," children were organized for collective learning and production.
