　　Nationalist Army Attacks Central Plains Liberated Area
    General Li Xiannian Issues Strong Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency Xuanhuaidian 23rd Dispatch] The Nationalist reactionaries, in violation of the Hankou Agreement, have amassed a large force and launched a large-scale attack on the Jianghan Military Region and other areas of the Central Plains Liberated Area. General Li Xiannian, Commander of the Central Plains Military Region, has lodged a strong protest, and submitted Memorandum Xuan No. 6 to the Hankou Second Executive Group detailing the Nationalist army's attack. This document has also been sent to the Xuanhuaidian Thirty-second Executive Group. Qualified sources in the Central Plains Military Region also stated: The increasingly expanded attacks by the Nationalist army in the Jianghan Military Region are aimed at attempting to occupy the entire region. Serious attention should now be paid to this action, exposing this planned conspiracy to undermine peace. If the Executive Group cannot effectively stop it, then our army, in order to maintain peace, defend the interests of the people, and seek survival, will be ready to rise up and defend ourselves at any time. The Nationalist army will bear full responsibility for all consequences.
