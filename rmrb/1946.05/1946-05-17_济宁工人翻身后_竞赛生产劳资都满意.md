　　【New China News Agency, Jinji-Luyu General Branch News】In recent months, the worker movement in Jining City, Jinji-Luyu Region, has seen significant development. In the past, under the rule of the enemy and puppets, and under the unreasonable oppression of the managers in power, the workers here suffered to the extreme. Therefore, when our army entered the city, they welcomed us with full enthusiasm. Workers at the electricity company automatically cut off the power lines of the traitor Liu Ben Gong in the city. Workers at the bathhouses warmly comforted the soldiers. Many workers also volunteered to help the army carry ladders, transport the wounded, lead the way, and transport ammunition. Later, with the support of the democratic government, they began their liberation movement. After more than one hundred workers at Yutang Sauce Garden won the first rational struggle with the manager, they held three marches and demonstrations to improve their treatment. During the struggle, the workers themselves printed leaflets such as "A Letter to Jining Workers," which won the sympathy of all citizens of Jining. Under the influence of the struggles of workers at Yutang and Yu Ji, eight printing houses including Cuihua, sauce gardens including Tianfu, Mashengtai, major woodworking factories including Wenju, cigarette factories including Tiansheng, and iron factories including Zhenhua, all increased wages through struggle. In mid-March, the first election of senators by workers was held, with secret ballots, and Liu Bantang, an old worker from Yutang, was honorably elected. Now, their living standards have improved, their enthusiasm for production has increased, and labor-management relations are close. Tiansheng and Dong Yuhua cigarette factories launched a major production competition, stipulating the conditions for production heroes. Under the workers' voluntary efforts, business at Yutang Sauce Garden is also more prosperous than before, so both labor and management are very satisfied. The preparatory committee for the General Labor Union was formally established at the end of April.

　　济宁工人翻身后
    竞赛生产劳资都满意
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】最近数月冀鲁豫区济宁市的工人运动，有很大发展。过去这里工人在敌伪统治下，在掌权经理的无理压迫下，痛苦已极，故当我军进城时，他们以满腔热情来欢迎，电灯公司工人自动将城内汉奸刘逆本功的电线割断，澡塘工人热烈慰问战士，还有许多工人自动帮军队抬梯子，抬伤兵，领路，运子弹。以后，他们就在民主政府扶持下，开始了翻身运动。玉堂酱园百余工人，第一次与经理进行说理斗争胜利后，他们为改善待遇，曾进行过三次游行示威。在斗争中，工人们自己印发了“告济宁工人书”等传单，博得全济宁市民的同情。在玉堂、余记工人斗争的影响下，粹华等八个印刷局，天富马盛泰等酱园，文聚等各大木业厂，天生等烟厂以及振华铁厂等，都经过斗争增加了工资。三月中旬，工人中第一次选举参议员，实行不记名投票，玉堂老工人刘板堂光荣当选。现在，他们的生活改善，生产热情提高劳资关系密切了。天生东玉华两烟厂发起生产大竞赛，规定了生产英雄的条件。玉堂酱园在工人自动努力下，买卖也较前繁荣起来，所以劳资双方都很满意，四月底正式成立总工会筹备会。
