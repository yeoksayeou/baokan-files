　　Iranian Prime Minister's Spokesman Statement
    Internal Affairs Not Difficult to Resolve Peacefully
    Condemns Ala for Echoing British and American Opinions and Slandering the Soviet Union
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th Dispatch] United Press International, Tehran Dispatch: Prince Firouz, spokesman for Iranian Prime Minister Soltaninejad, declared that although the conflict between the Iranian central army and the Azerbaijan Autonomous Federation has not ceased, he anticipates an early resolution of the Azerbaijan issue and emphasized the Iranian government's desire for a peaceful settlement.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th Dispatch] Tehran Dispatch: The Azerbaijan delegation investigating the Azerbaijan border conflict has arrived in Tehran and, together with representatives appointed by the Iranian government, has formed a committee to proceed to the border for investigation.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th Dispatch] Reuters, Tehran Dispatch: Iranian government spokesman Prince Firouz formally denied yesterday evening at a reception for journalists the statement issued by Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ala, to the Security Council. Firouz stated: "Some of the statements made by Ala do not represent the views of the Iranian government. The government has not given him such instructions, and therefore this statement and other similar statements represent only his personal opinions. Ala has now received instructions from the Prime Minister that he must not issue such statements again." According to reports, at the Security Council on the 22nd, Ala claimed that Soviet troops were still interfering in Iran's internal affairs and falsely alleged that Soviet troops remained in Azerbaijan and armed the "rebels" of Azerbaijan (i.e., the democratic elements in Azerbaijan province demanding autonomy). British and American representatives then used this as an excuse to obstruct the continuation of the so-called Iranian issue on the agenda. Firouz's above statement shows that Ala's remarks were clearly rumors, and the reasons for the British and American representatives' obstruction are groundless.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd Dispatch] The Security Council held a meeting on the 19th to discuss the Soviet-Iranian issue. US Representative Stettinius still claimed that although Soviet troops did withdraw from Azerbaijan on May 6, it was not the end, and therefore the Iranian issue could not be removed from the Security Council's agenda. (Note: The Iranian government had previously announced that "the Iranian mission, after arriving in Azerbaijan province, confirmed that Soviet troops had withdrawn as scheduled.") Soviet Representative Gromyko did not attend the meeting. Polish Representative Lange opposed Stettinius's opinion, saying: "The Security Council should accept the Iranian Prime Minister's statement." Iranian reactionary Ambassador to the United States, Ala, speaking at the time, still echoed British and American opinions, falsely claiming that "Soviet troops only withdrew from Azerbaijan after May 6." At the insistence of the United States and Britain, the meeting passed Stettinius's proposal to keep the Iranian issue on the agenda and postpone discussion. Stettinius's reason for insisting was that the Iranian government's announcement only concerned Azerbaijan province. According to Ala's report at the Security Council's second discussion of the Iranian issue on the 8th of this month, "Official news from Tehran confirms that Soviet troops have withdrawn from all areas except Azerbaijan province, which has not yet been confirmed." Based on this, Stettinius's reason for insisting is clearly for other purposes.

### 伊总理发言人声明  内政不难和平解决  斥艾拉附和英美意见诬蔑苏联

　　伊总理发言人声明
    内政不难和平解决
    斥艾拉附和英美意见诬蔑苏联
    【新华社延安二十日电】合众社德黑兰讯：伊朗总理苏尔丹尼的发言人，弗鲁兹亲王宣称：伊朗中央军与阿塞拜疆自治联邦间的冲突，虽未停止，但他预料阿塞拜疆问题能及早解决，并强调伊政府对和平解决的愿望。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】德黑兰讯：调查阿塞拜疆边界冲突的阿塞拜疆代表团已达德黑兰，并与伊政府委派的代表合组委员会，出发边境进行调查。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】路透社德黑兰讯：伊朗政府发言人弗鲁兹亲王，昨日晚在招待记者席上，正式否认伊朗驻美大使艾拉向安理会所发之声明，弗鲁兹称：“艾拉所作的一些声明，并不能代表伊朗政府的意见，政府没有给他这样的训令，因此他的这一声明及其他类似的声明，都仅仅是代表他个人的意见而已。艾拉现已获得总理的训令以后，不得再发表此类声明”。按二十二日安理会上，艾拉曾声称苏军仍在伊朗干涉内政，并造谣称：苏军仍留住阿塞拜疆，并武装阿的“叛乱者”（即阿省要求自治的民主分子），美英代表当时即借此留难将所谓伊朗问题继续留在议程上。弗鲁兹上述声明，说明艾拉之发言显系造谣，而美英代表留难之理由，毫无根据。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】安理会十九日举行会议，讨论苏伊问题，美代表斯退丁纽斯仍称：苏军确于五月六日自阿塞拜疆撤退，但并非结束，因而伊朗问题不能自安理会议程上取消（按伊政府前此曾公布称：“伊朗使团抵阿省后证实苏军已如期撤毕”），苏代表葛罗米柯未出席会议。波兰代表兰吉反对斯退丁纽斯的意见，他说：“安理会应接受伊总理的声明”。伊反动派驻美大使艾拉发言时，仍附和英美意见，诬称：“苏军在五月六日以后方撤离阿塞拜疆”。会议在美英坚持下，通过斯退丁纽斯的提案，将伊朗问题继续留在议程上，展期讨论。斯氏坚持之理由，是伊政府之公布，只涉及阿省。按本月八日，安理会二次讨论伊朗问题时，艾拉之报告，曾称：“德黑兰官方消息，除阿省尚未证实外，其他各地苏军俱已撤退”。据此则斯氏所坚持之理由，显系别有用意。
