　　Yongnian Puppet Troops Continue Provocations
    U.S. Representative Confirms Deep Regret; We Again Demand Disbandment of Puppet Troops in the City
    [This Newspaper Yongnian Twenty-seventh Dispatch] Since the U.S. and KMT representatives of the Yongnian group entered Yongnian city, the puppet troops in the city, under the instigation and protection of the KMT representative, have become increasingly rampant, actively engaging in provocations, and are urgently repairing airport works in the city, plotting to use Yongnian city as a base for coordinating a large-scale civil war. The U.S. and KMT representatives entered the city on the afternoon of the 15th. Starting at 9:00 AM the next morning, the puppet troops in the city launched a fierce shooting attack on the defensive positions of our troops outside the West Gate. Chen Fu, a platoon leader of the first squad of the first company of the first battalion of the third sub-district of Jinnan, was seriously wounded. After a personal investigation and examination by the three-party representatives, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Olson confirmed that he was indeed injured by the puppet troops, while KMT Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng made unreasonable sophistry and shirked responsibility for the puppet troops. At around 4:00 PM on the 24th, puppet troops even sneaked out of the city by boat and opened fire to harass, and an ordinary person, Dong Liangzi, was shot and died six hours later. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM that night, the puppet troops sent out sixty to seventy people, took a boat to attack Songdi Village, five miles east of the city, captured villagers Dong Xigui and others, and robbed two civilian rifles. For this reason, our representative, Special Envoy, requested the U.S. and KMT representatives to go out of the city together for investigation. However, KMT Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng defended the puppet troops again, and even shamelessly claimed: "No one was killed, it's all fabricated by the Communist side." However, knowing that he was in the wrong, he refused to go out of the city to examine the corpse. U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Olson personally examined the corpse on the 25th and 26th and went to Songdi Village for investigation. As a result, he expressed his deep regret for this unfortunate incident. Furthermore, on the fourth day (the 18th) after the KMT representative entered the city, the puppet troops ordered the demolition of houses on 18 streets including West Street (accounting for one-third of the entire city), mobilized 2,000 people every day to urgently repair the airport, and built pillboxes and fortifications in the four cities on a large scale. Our resident military representative, Political Commissar Tian Ye, solemnly stated to U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Olson: "Since the Kuomintang representative entered the city, the puppet troops have carried out a series of provocative actions and are preparing for a civil war, which is obviously a planned conspiracy under the instruction of the Kuomintang representative. We request the group to forward this to the Executive Headquarters to order the disbandment of the puppet troops in Yongnian city, and the Kuomintang representative should immediately stop this dangerous behavior of the puppet troops, otherwise the Kuomintang representative will be responsible for the consequences."

　　永年伪军继续挑衅
    美方代表证实深表遗憾我再要求解散城内伪军
    【本报永年二十七日电】自永年小组国美两方代表进入永年城后，城内伪军在国方代表指使庇护下，愈益猖狂，积极进行挑衅，并在城内赶修机场工事，阴谋将永年城作为策应大规模内战的基地。国美两方代表系于十五日下午入城，翌晨九时起城内伪军即向西关外我军防地猛烈射击，我冀南三分区一大队一中队一排排长陈辅当负重伤，经三方代表亲自调查检验后，美代表奥尔森中校已证实确系伪军打伤，而国方代表张朝正中校则为伪军无理狡辩，推诿责任。二十四日下午四时许，竟又有伪军乘船窜出城外，开枪骚扰，老百姓董良子当被击中，六小时后即行殒命，讵当夜十时，伪又派出六七十人，乘船向城东五里之宋堤村进攻，捕去村民董喜贵等四人，劫去民枪两枝。为此我方代表特派员请国美两方代表出城共同调查，乃国方代表张朝正中校又为伪军抵赖，竟＠然声称：“并未打死人，全属共方捏造。”然自知理屈，又拒绝出城验尸，美代表奥尔森中校于二十五、二十六两日先后亲自验尸，并往宋堤村调查，结果表示对于此次不幸事件，极表遗撼。又伪军于国方代表进城后第四日（十八日）即下令拆毁西街等十八条街道的民房（占全城三分之一），每日以两千人赶修机场，并在四城大事兴筑碉堡工事，我驻军代表田野政委当向美代表奥尔森中校郑重提出：“自国民党代表入城后，伪军又进行一连串的挑衅行为，并作策应内战准备，显系在国民党代表授意下之有计划的阴谋行动，我们要求小组转呈执行部下令解散永年城内伪军，国民党代表并应即刻制止伪军此种危险行为，否则其后果概由国民党代表负责。”
