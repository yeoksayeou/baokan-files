　　Taihang Administrative Office Directs All Special Districts and Counties
    Prepare for Wind and Hailstorms and Organize Emergency Harvesting
    [Xinhua News Agency Jinji Luyu General Branch News] As the summer harvest approaches, the Taihang Administrative Office, in order to prevent delays and damage from wind and hailstorms, specifically instructs all special districts and counties to organize the masses to carry out emergency harvesting. It also points out several tasks that must be grasped before and after the summer harvest: 1. After the wheat heads sprout and bloom, stop applying top dressing and weeding, so as not to delay the maturity period. 2. Mobilize the masses to plant crops in the wheat furrows after the wheat heads sprout, striving to plant two crops even in areas where the wheat harvest is relatively late. 3. Remove and burn diseased plants. Select healthy wheat areas to prepare for large-scale seed selection. 4. Mobilize the masses to select seeds in the fields, and exchange seeds with healthy wheat areas. 5. Carry out an insect catching campaign before cutting the wheat, so that insects cannot transfer into the autumn vegetables. 6. Conduct harvest statistics and healthy ear/diseased ear percentage statistics based on key points. 7. Hold small-scale wheat ear competitions at base points to promote "169" wheat, and the selection methods for wheat seed retention areas. Introduce superior wheat varieties and organize wheat seed exchange. The Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry will control "169" wheat seeds, prepare for allocation after autumn, and provide technical guidance materials.

　　太行行署指示各专县
    防备风雹组织抢收
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】夏收将至，太行行署为防止延缓时间，遭受风雹袭击，特指示各专县组织群众进行抢收，并指出夏收前后要抓紧做的几项工作：一、小麦抽穗扬花后，停止上追肥、锄苗，免得延缓成熟期。二、动员群众于小麦抽穗后进行麦垄插种，争取麦收较迟的地方也能种两季。三、拔除病株并烧毁之。选择健康小麦区准备大量选种。四、发动群众在田间选种，及与健康小麦区交换种籽。五、割麦前先进行一次捉虫，使虫不能转入秋菜中。六、分基点进行收成统计和好穗病穗百分比统计。七．找基点开小型的麦穗赛会，宣传“一六九”小麦，小麦留种地的选种办法。介绍优良麦种，组织麦种交换。农林局掌握“一六九”小麦种籽，准备秋后调剂，并供给技术指导材料。
