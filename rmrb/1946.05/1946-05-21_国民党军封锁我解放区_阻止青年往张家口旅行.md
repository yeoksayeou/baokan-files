　　Kuomintang Army Blockades Our Liberated Areas
    Preventing Youth from Traveling to Zhangjiakou
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th dispatch] Beiping News: The railways, highways, and other transportation routes around Beiping leading to the Liberated Areas are still tightly blockaded by Kuomintang troops, prohibiting people from freely traveling. The flow of food and other supplies is also cut off. Recently, more than twenty young people planned to travel to Zhangjiakou, but were turned back by the Kuomintang garrison at Nankou. Afterwards, one of them wrote a letter to the Jiefang Daily, stating: As a citizen of the nation, I lodge a protest with the authorities. Why is it that Americans can travel freely, but Chinese people cannot set foot there? Are Chinese youths in their own country's territory more restricted than foreigners? What is the meaning of restoring transportation? Are promises of freedom only meant to sound pleasing to our ears? It is said that there are many "tyrannical policies" in the "Communist Army Areas," why not let us go and see these "tyrannical policies"?

　　国民党军封锁我解放区
    阻止青年往张家口旅行
    【新华社延安十六日电】北平讯：平市周围通达解放区的铁路公路等交通，迄今仍为国民党军队严密封锁，禁止人民自由来往。并断绝粮食等流通。日前有青年二十余人拟往张家口旅行，走到南口，即被国民党驻军逐回。事后，其中一人投书解放报称：我以国民一分子的资格，向当局提出抗议，为什么美国人都可以自由来往的地方，中国人反不能涉足？难道中国青年在自己祖国的领土上，比外国人的自由还受限制吗？请问恢复交通的意义何在？请问自由的诺言是只叫我们听来悦耳的吗？说是“共军区”有许多“虐政”，为何不叫我们去看看这些“虐政”呢？
