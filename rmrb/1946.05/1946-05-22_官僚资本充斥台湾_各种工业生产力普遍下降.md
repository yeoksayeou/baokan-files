　　Bureaucratic Capital Fills Taiwan
    Various Industrial Productivity Generally Declines
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th】According to a speech by Ju Keyong, Director of the Department of Industry and Mining of Taiwan Province, published in a Central News Agency dispatch from Taipei on the 12th, almost all industrial and mining enterprises in Taipei are currently established by bureaucratic capital. The authorities have established management committees for sugar, electricity and metallurgy, petroleum, fertilizer, cement, coal, alkali production, gold and copper mines, electrical engineering, machinery, paper, textiles, chemicals, oils and fats, glass, printing, and industrial and mining equipment industries. The handling methods involve joint ventures between the central and provincial governments, or joint ventures between local and private entities, followed by acceptance according to "legal procedures" (which clearly benefits bureaucratic capital). Four types of defense industries have been designated as state-owned, and preparations are underway to organize companies monopolizing industrial and mining industries, including twenty-one units such as petroleum and sugar. Although Mr. Bao explained that private investment is allowed, there is no doubt that private capital will only be rejected under the legal procedures or participate as an appendage of bureaucratic capital. Mr. Bao's speech also revealed that Taiwan's industry, under the monopoly of bureaucratic capital, cannot develop and cannot even restore its past productivity. For example, in the entire industrial and mining sector, the most important sugar industry only produced 90,000 tons this year, while the highest past output was 1.3 million tons, only one-fifteenth of the past. Coal production is 90,000 tons per month (past monthly production was 200,000 tons). Power generation is 52,000 kilowatts, while the highest past capacity was 328,000 kilowatts, less than one-fifth of the past.

　　官僚资本充斥台湾
    各种工业生产力普遍下降
    【新华社延安十八日电】根据中央社台北十二日电所发表的台省工矿处处长句可永谈话，目前台北工矿事业几乎全部为官僚资本所设，当局已设有管理委员会者，计有糖、电冶、石油、肥料、水泥、煤、制碱、金铜矿、电工、机械、纸、纺织、化学、油脂、玻璃、印刷、工矿器材等业。处理办法，分别由中央与省合营，或地方与民合营后按“法定秩序”（按这显然是对官僚资本有利）的程序接收。四种国防工业已划归国营，刻拟筹备组织垄断工矿业的公司，竟包括了石油、糖业等二十一单位。虽然包氏说明允许人民投资，但没有疑问的，民资将只有在法定程序下被拒于门外，或作为官僚资本的附从才能参加。包氏谈话又透露了台湾工业在官僚资本垄断下，无法发展，甚至不能恢复过去的生产力。如在整个工矿事业中，最重要的糖业，本年仅产九万吨，过去最高产量本为一百三十万吨，仅为过去的十五分之一。煤产每月九万吨（过去月产二十万吨）。发电力五万二千瓦，过去最高量三十二万八千瓦，不及过去五分之一。
