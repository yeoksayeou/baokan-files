　　Labor Unrest Rises Again in the United States
    Truman's Mediation of Railway Strike Fails; 250,000 Workers to Begin General Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] Washington D.C. dispatch: What the New York Times called "the fleeting moment before the great domestic crisis in the United States" is about to end, facing the serious threat of both railway and coal mine strikes, which are about to begin. After President Truman's mediation of the railway strike failed, he ordered the takeover of the railways on the 17th. However, 250,000 railway workers are still scheduled to begin a nationwide general strike on the 24th. Truman's mediation of the coal industry strike broke down because the management refused the labor's welfare fund demands. 400,000 coal miners have also decided to resume the strike on the 26th.

　　美国工潮又起
    杜鲁门调解铁路工潮失败廾五万工人将开始总罢工
    【新华社延安二十二日电】华府讯：纽约时报所称：“美国巨大国内危机前的瞬息时刻”，即将结束，面临着的铁道与煤矿两大工潮的严重威胁，即将开始。杜鲁门总统在调解铁道工潮失败后，于十七日下令接管铁路。但二十五万铁路工人，仍订于二十四日开始全国范围的总罢工。杜鲁门对煤业工潮之调停，因资方拒绝劳方福利基金的要求而告破裂。四十万煤矿工人，亦决于二十六日重行罢工。
