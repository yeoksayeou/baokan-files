　　Paris Foreign Ministers Conference Stalled
    Bidault Proposes Reconvening in June
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Sixteenth] Paris dispatch: At the secret meeting of the four foreign ministers on the afternoon of the 14th, Bidault proposed four points: (1) The Foreign Ministers Conference should be adjourned and reconvened on June 15th. During the adjournment, all unresolved issues should be studied by the assistants to the foreign ministers, and a draft peace treaty should be drawn up. (2) A peace conference should be convened on July 1st or 15th. (3) The revised armistice terms with Italy should be signed immediately. (4) The Austrian issue should be discussed when the Foreign Ministers Conference reconvenes. No decision was made on the above proposals. According to Reuters, "France and Britain are expected to accept Bidault's revised draft on the armistice terms with Italy with very few amendments." Before Bidault made his proposals, the conference again discussed the issues of colonies, reparations, and the Italo-Yugoslav border in the peace treaty with Italy, and reviewed Austria's memorandum on the South Tyrol border. Since the foreign ministers still insisted on their original opinions, none of the above issues were resolved, and it was decided to hand them over to the assistants to the foreign ministers for study. At the secret meeting on the afternoon of the 15th, the German issue began to be raised. The Soviet Union agreed with the French opinion, advocating that the Ruhr issue should be discussed first, while the British side requested that general German issues be discussed first.

　　巴黎外长会议搁浅
    贝纳斯提议六月再开
    【新华社延安十六日电】巴黎讯：十四日下午四外长秘密会议上，贝纳斯提议四点：（１）外长会议休会，延至六月十五日再开，在休会期间，一切未决问题，交由外长助理研讨，并草拟和约草案。（２）于七月一日或十五日召开和会。（３）立即签订已修改的对意休战条款。（４）外长会议复会时，应讨论奥地利问题。上述建议未获决定。据路透社称：“预计法英将以很少之修正而接受贝纳斯关于对意休战条款之修改草案”。贝纳斯发表其建议前，会议曾再次讨论关于对意和约中之殖民地问题、赔款问题及意南边界问题，并审查奥地利关于南梯罗尔边界之备忘录。由于各外长仍坚持其原来意见，上述问题俱无结果，乃决议交由外长助理去研讨。十五日下午秘密会议上，德国问题开始被提出，苏联同意法方之意见，主张首先讨论鲁尔问题，而英方要求先讨论一般的德国问题。
