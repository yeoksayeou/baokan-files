　　【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 7th】 The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee has readjusted its administrative organization and principles of economic management, and decided as follows: (A) Administrative divisions: (1) The Border Region is divided into five administrative districts, namely, the provincial governments of Chahar and Rehe, and the administrative offices of three regions: Central Hebei, Jin-Sui, and Eastern Hebei. The entire Border Region is reorganized into nineteen special districts, and a total of five special districts are abolished. (2) All localities should restore the old county governance from before the war. Those that need to be governed separately due to natural conditions may establish county public offices, but must be approved by the Border Region Government Committee. (3) The districts (the area between the county and village) in the old liberated areas should be appropriately expanded, and the districts in the edge areas of the newly liberated areas can be smaller. The work of reducing the number of districts must be completed by the end of May. (B) Organizational structure: (1) Determining that counties and provinces are local autonomous units, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational structures of the provincial administrative offices and counties, while also strengthening various construction departments and reducing departments that were adapted to wartime but now have little work. (2) Determining that the special commissioner's office will be an auxiliary organ of the future administrative office or provincial government, the organization is scaled down. Each administrative office and provincial government will directly lead and control the counties from now on. (3) After the expansion of the district, the division of labor of the district assistants, except for the security officer and the assistant in charge of preferential treatment for soldiers' families and veteran rehabilitation work, should generally be divided according to the region. The village regime must be further improved to give full play to its role. (4) In large market towns with developed commerce, a population of more than 10,000, or located on important transportation routes, township public offices should be established, directly led by the county, to carry out government work and prosper the market town economy. (5) The establishment of governments at all levels stipulates that the administrative office and provincial government generally have 150 people, the special commissioner's office has 30 people, the county government has an average of 100 people (including police and judicial custodial personnel), and the district public office has an average of 9 people. Counties and districts can be divided into first, second, and third classes according to the actual situation, and then different establishments can be specified separately. (6) In order to unify and strengthen the management of finance and economy, the Border Region Government Committee will set up special financial and economic commissioner offices in each administrative region. The establishment includes one special financial and economic commissioner, three secretaries and staff members. Their duties are to represent the Border Region Government Committee in the unified management of the various financial and economic organizations and business departments of the Border Region Government Committee stationed in the administrative region. (C) Work responsibilities: (1) Handicraft and small industries should be operated by cooperatives as much as possible, or private individuals should be mobilized to operate them, and the government should provide guidance and assistance in terms of policy. Larger factories and mines, except for a few operated by the Border Region Government Committee, should mostly be jointly operated by public and private entities, or transferred to private individuals for operation, and enterprise and rationalization should be implemented. The government only provides guidance in terms of policy. Each administrative office and province below it will temporarily not establish factory management agencies. Transportation and postal services are uniformly managed by the Border Region Government Committee. In areas with a lot of telecommunications work (including telephone and telegraph), a bureau can be set up for special management; in areas with less work, the industrial departments of the government will manage it. In areas with long highways, a highway bureau can be established; in areas with short highways, the industrial departments of the government will manage it. (2) The grain work is gradually uniformly controlled by the Border Region. Trade policies and trade administration are controlled by the financial departments of governments at all levels. (3) Social education is mainly the responsibility of the county level, mainly to run vocational schools, normal schools, and secondary schools.
