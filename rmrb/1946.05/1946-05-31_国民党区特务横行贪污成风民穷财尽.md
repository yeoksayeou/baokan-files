　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th dispatch】 Chongqing News: The Democratic Daily recently published an article entitled "Immediately Stop the Civil War," commenting on the situation in the Kuomintang areas: "Today's politics is characterized by rampant corruption and rampant secret agents. If those in power have any conscience, they should look back at their past achievements and silently contemplate their future prospects. Today's financial and economic situation has reached a dead end, relying entirely on the excessive issuance of paper money to maintain it. Reports state that the monthly issuance amount is 20 million yuan, but the actual number is probably much larger than this. The general public is mostly trapped in a miserable situation where they cannot survive nor seek death. Speaking of today's military, the living conditions of government soldiers are such that they wear clothes worse than Japanese prisoners and eat food inferior to foreigners' pet dogs. ... Now that victory has been achieved, not only do they not get the opportunity to retire and return home to see their parents, wives, and children again, but they are also driven to the white mountains and black waters, forcing compatriots who survived the disaster to kill each other, which they are absolutely unwilling to do. Therefore, from the economy to the military, there can absolutely be no more civil war.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th dispatch】 Shanghai News: According to the Zhengyan Daily, the Wartime Production Bureau ordered four million bolts of cloth from the United States last summer, of which the first batch of one million bolts has been shipped to Shanghai. Once this order is fully delivered to Shanghai, cotton cloth prices are bound to fall. In order to cope with this uncompetitive price level, Shanghai's textile industry has begun to shrink its business. According to the Shanghai Wenhui Daily, recently, the import of American cotton has been increasing daily (in Tianjin alone, from January to March, the total value of American cotton imports reached over 200 million yuan). Domestic manufacturers also abandon Chinese cotton and use American cotton because American cotton has better quality and lower prices than Chinese cotton. If this continues, the sales of domestic cotton will inevitably become increasingly difficult.

### 国民党区特务横行贪污成风民穷财尽

　　国民党区特务横行贪污成风民穷财尽
    【新华社延安二十八日电】渝讯：民主报近以“立即制止内战”为题，评述国民党区各方面情形道：“今日的政治是贪污成风，特务横行，执政者稍有良心，应该回顾既往他的政绩在那里，默念未来他的前途又在那里。今日的财政经济已到山穷水尽的地步，全靠滥发纸币来维持，报载每月发行额为二千万万元，实际上的数目当比此大得多。一般人民大多陷于求生不得，求死不能的苦境。谈到今日的军事，政府军队的士兵生活，穿的不如日本俘虏，吃的不如外人的洋狗。……现在胜利了，他们不但得不到退伍还乡和父母妻儿再见的机会，而且把他们驱之于白山黑水之间，使劫后余生的同胞，自相残杀，他们当然是绝对不愿的。因此从经济到军事，都是绝对不能再有内战。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】沪讯：据正言报载称：去夏战时生产局向美订购之布四百万匹，其中首批一百万匹已运上海，当此项订货全部到沪后，棉布价格势将下落。上海纺织业为应付此种无法竞争之价格水准，已纷纷紧缩业务云。又据上海文汇报载：最近美贷棉进口日形增加（仅就天津一地一至三月，美棉进口总值达二亿余万），国内厂商亦因美棉较国棉质地良好价格低廉，因之皆舍中国棉而采用美棉长此以往，国棉销路势将日趋困难。
