　　【New China News Agency, Yan'an, 20th dispatch】 Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese people's demonstration movement demanding the establishment of a democratic government and the resolution of the increasingly serious famine is in full swing. Following the demonstrations by over ten thousand people three times on the 17th, on the 19th, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other democratic parties, the Japanese people held a mass rally of 250,000 people in front of the Imperial Palace, demanding the resolution of the food problem and the formation of a democratic government. After the mass rally, it turned into a massive march and demonstration. At that time, mechanized cavalry units of the American army patrolled the vicinity of the Imperial Palace in armored vehicles, equipped with machine guns and light artillery, with their covers removed, as if facing a formidable enemy. However, the masses still presented a petition to the Emperor, stating: "We laborers, due to hunger, cannot continue to work hard and cannot maintain our survival. However, the current government can do nothing to improve the people's living conditions. We demand that the Emperor allow the people to manage the food themselves and organize a new government." Kato Kanju, a left-wing leader of the Socialist Party and one of the organizers of the Tokyo mass rally, demanded that the food hidden by the wealthy be distributed to the people and a democratic government be established. A representative of the Japanese Communist Party said: "We workers demand that the food rations given to the workers be at least sufficient to keep them working. However, the current reactionary government cannot meet the demands of the people." Furthermore, a dispatch stated: On the 19th, 25 representatives of the demonstrators staged a sit-in at Yoshida's official residence, lying on conference tables and armchairs all day and night until they left the next day.

　　日人民要求民主、粮食
    廾五万人游行示威
    美军当场卸去炮衣如临大敌
    【新华社延安二十日电】东京讯：日本人民要求建立民主政府及解决日益严重的饥荒，示威运动正如火如荼的展开，继十七日万余人一日三起示威后，十九日日本人民在共产党及社会党等民主党派领导下，又在日皇宫前举行二十五万人的群众大会，提出解决粮食问题及组织民主政府的要求，群众大会结束后，即转为浩大的游行示威，当时皇宫附近有美机械化骑兵分乘装甲车来往巡逻，车上并有机枪及轻型大炮，均卸去炮衣，如临大敌，但群众仍向日皇呈递请求书，谓：“我们劳动者由于饥饿，不能继续努力工作，而且无法维持生存，可是现政府对改善国民生活状况，什么也不能作，我们要求日皇准许人民自己管理粮食，并组织新政府。东京群众大会的组织者之一社会党左翼领袖加藤勘十，要求把财主隐藏的粮食分给人民，建立民主政府。日共代表说：“我们工人要求把给予工人的配给粮，至少足以保持他们能继续工作，可是现在反动政府无法满足人民的要求。”又讯：十九日有示威群众代表二十五人，在吉田官邸内实行静坐示威，当日夜间均躺于会议桌及靠椅上，直至翌日始离去。
