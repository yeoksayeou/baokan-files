    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 15th (Delayed Dispatch)] After receiving reinforcements, the invading Kuomintang troops launched attacks on the Democratic Allied Forces’ positions in Raodaogou, Erdaogou, Wafangzi, Lijialinzi, Yujiagou, etc. on the 14th, concentrating over 40 artillery pieces for a fierce bombardment, supported by three aircraft. All attacks were unsuccessful.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 16th] The Siping Front's defense battle, thanks to the heroic resistance of the Democratic Allied Forces, has seen a period of lull. However, various indications show that the Kuomintang troops are now beginning a new offensive. Between the 18th and 29th of last month, the Kuomintang troops launched eight offensives, with the most intense being the four attacks on the 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 29th, all of which were repulsed by the Democratic Allied Forces. After these battles, the front reached a stalemate. Recently, the Kuomintang troops transferred the main force of the New 6th Army and the 88th Division of the 71st Army from Southern Manchuria to the Siping Street front, and also concentrated several aircraft in Shenyang for support. On the 14th and 15th, fierce fighting broke out again on the front.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 16th] Yesterday, the front saw fierce fighting all day. At 8 AM, two divisions of the Kuomintang 71st Army launched a fierce attack on the Democratic Allied Forces' positions in Zhao Jiagou and Ren Jiatun, charging six times and firing over 3,000 artillery shells. The Democratic Allied Forces rose up to resist, repulsing them and leaving over 300 enemy corpses behind.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Bai Chongxi, who had been traveling between Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Jinan earlier this month to arrange the civil war, returned to Nanjing on the 9th. Yesterday, he hurriedly flew from Nanjing to Beiping with orders from the Kuomintang highest authority, and then proceeded to the Northeast.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Today, this agency presents a comprehensive military report: (1) Northeast: (omitted). (2) Jiangsu-Anhui: Xia Wei's Kuomintang troops, with eight regiments, continue to fiercely attack the 4th Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region west of the Huainan Jinpu Railway.

Huaibei, Huai'an and other cities in northern Jiangsu were harassed by Kuomintang aircraft on the 15th. (3) Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu: A part of the Kuomintang 40th Army in northern Henan, along with over 2,000 troops of the puppet Li Ying's forces, invaded the area west of the Wei River in the 4th Sub-district of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu on the 12th.
