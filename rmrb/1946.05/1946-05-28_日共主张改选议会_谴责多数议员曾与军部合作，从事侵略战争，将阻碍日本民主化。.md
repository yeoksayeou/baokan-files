　　JCP Advocates for Re-election of Parliament
    Condemns Majority of Members for Collaborating with Military Clique and Engaging in Aggressive War, Which Will Hinder Japan's Democratization.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 21st, vehemently denouncing the "Parliament" and condemning the vast majority of its members as "reactionary elements who collaborated with the military clique and engaged in aggressive war," pointing out that more than 80 members should be prohibited from holding public office according to MacArthur's purge order. The statement declared: "Major war criminals still occupy key positions in state institutions, hindering Japan's democratization." The statement demanded a new election of the parliament, severe punishment of war criminals, and issued a warning to the world, pointing out that "the current situation in Japan is facilitating reactionaries in burying the seeds of disrupting future Pacific peace," appealing to the Allied nations to closely monitor the situation in Japan. On the 20th, major newspapers in Tokyo all rose up to accuse the newly appointed Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tadayoshi Miki (Liberal Party), and Vice-Speaker Kimura (Progressive Party) of being war criminals. According to reports, Miki served as the president of the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun during the war, and the newspaper vehemently supported the war. Miki also served in the wartime Cabinet Information Bureau and the Greater Japan Political Association's Asia Development Department. The newspapers also published the speech by JCP leader Kyuichi Tokuda when attending the opening ceremony of the new parliament, exposing that the current parliament is "a place for reactionaries to carry out anti-democratic conspiracies, and among them are many disguised war criminals." The newspapers revealed that after Tokuda's speech, reactionary members of parliament dispatched representatives to hold secret meetings, plotting to attack JCP members of parliament. Regarding the nature of the current Japanese parliament, the Soviet Red Star newspaper pointed out: "The majority of members in this parliament oppose the establishment of genuine democracy in the country, and this parliament is an obstacle to the further democratization of Japan."

    谴责多数议员曾与军部合作，从事侵略战争，将阻碍日本民主化。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】东京讯：日共于二十一日发表声明，痛斥“议会”，谴责议员中绝大多数是“曾与军部合作，从事侵略战争的反动分子”，指出有八十余名议员，按麦克阿瑟的清洗命令，应禁止任公职。该声明宣称：“尚有大的战犯盘踞国家机构要津，阻碍日本民主化。”该声明要求从新改选议会，严惩战犯，并向全世界发出警号，指出“今天日本的局势，正便利了反动派埋下搅乱未来太平洋和平的火种”，呼吁盟国密切注视日本形势。二十日，东京各大报纸均纷起指责新任众议会议长三木忠吉（自由党）和副议长木村（进步党）均系战犯。按三木战时曾任东京报知新闻社总裁，该报激烈支持战争。三木并曾任职战时内阁情报局及大政翼赞会兴亚部。各报并刊载日共领袖德田球一于出席新议会开幕典礼时的演说，揭发此次议会为“反动派贯彻反民主阴谋的场所，在他们之中有许多是经过伪装了的战犯”。各报透露德田演说后，反动议员们曾推派代表举行秘密会议，阴谋打击日共议员。对日本本届议会性质，苏联红星报指出：“这届议会中大多数议员，都反对在国内建立真正的民主，本届议会是阻碍日本进一步民主化的议会。”
