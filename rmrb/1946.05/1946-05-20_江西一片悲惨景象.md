　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th】Nanchang Dispatch: After eight years of devastation by the enemy in Jiangxi, over 76% of the province's cities and villages present a scene of tragedy, ruin, and desolation. According to preliminary statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Statistics Office, the province suffered over 500,400 casualties, people's property losses amounted to 93 million yuan, and over 269,000 head of cattle were lost during the eight years. The war is over, and the people hope for recovery, but they are now facing another terrible disaster—famine, widespread epidemics, and endless exorbitant taxes.
　　Taking Nanchang as an example, since the arrival of victory, prices have been soaring, especially grain prices, which have taken the lead, increasing dozens of times in more than half a year (Note: In March, each stone reached 30,000 yuan, and it is now far beyond this figure). The people who have suffered from the enemy and puppets naturally have no money to buy rice to fill their stomachs and have to use grass roots and tree bark to prolong their remaining lives. In Ga'an, De'an, Fengxin, Shanggao, and other counties in northern Jiangxi, there are often no people for dozens of miles, and 3 to 4 million mu of farmland are barren. The cattle have been slaughtered, and the seeds have been looted. In the Pingxiang area of western Jiangxi, there was also a drought last year that had not been seen in decades, with the early rice harvest failing completely and the late rice harvest being less than 30%. They are now in a severe spring famine.
　　Epidemics and famine are like twin brothers. This spring, the black hand of the plague has once again arrived, and other infectious diseases are also prevalent in the south. A meningitis outbreak occurred in Yudu's Yinkeng Town, killing more than 50 villagers in less than a month. Subsequently, outbreaks were also discovered in Xingguo, Yongxiu, and near Nanchang. Recently, the prevalence of measles and smallpox in Nanchang and Jiujiang can be said to have broken all previous records! The authorities are completely unconcerned about this.
　　While the people are groaning and crying out for food, the government has apportioned a huge amount of 2 million shi of grain. Taking the small county of Xiajiang as an example, with a current population of only over 30,000, the number of surplus grain levied has been allocated as high as 100,000 shi. Based on the current population, even including breastfeeding infants, each person has to contribute three shi of grain. In addition to the grain levy, the local bao and jia heads are all bloodsuckers. The bao and jia heads in rural areas less than 20 miles from Nanchang have to donate 1,000 to 2,000 yuan from the people every month. Stores in the suburbs of Nanchang have to donate at least 100 yuan per person per month, regardless of the size of their business. There are road repair fees and sanitation donations; even children who have just turned one year old have to be assigned to work on road repairs, and if they cannot do it, they have to pay money.

　　江西一片悲惨景象
    南昌通讯
    【新华社延安十七日电】南昌通讯：江西经过敌寇八年的蹂躏，全省百分之七十六以上的城市和乡村，呈现在眼前的是一片悲惨残破凋零的景象。据江西省统计处的初步统计，八年来人口伤亡五十万零四千余人，人民财产损失国币九千三百余万万，耕牛损失二十六万九千余头。战争结束了，人民希望复苏了，但是他们又面临着另一个可怕的灾难——饥饿灾荒，普遍流行的瘟疫和无穷尽的苛捐杂税。
    以南昌为例，自胜利到来，物价一直向上跑，特别是粮价，一马当先，半年多来翻了数十倍（按：三月间，每石即达三万，现当远超此数），饱受敌伪摧残的老百姓自然无钱买米充饥，只好用草根树皮苟延残余生命了。赣北的高安，德安、奉新、上高等县，现在往往数十里没有人烟，田地荒芜达三四百万亩，耕牛杀光了，籽种也被抢光了。赣西萍乡一带，去年还遭到几十年来未见的旱灾，早稻颗粒无收，晚稻收成不及三成，现在陷入严重的春荒中。
    疫疠和灾荒好象一对孪生兄弟，今春鼠疫的黑手又光临了，南部其他传染病也到处流行，雩都的银坑镇发生脑膜灾，不到一个月，便死了五十多个乡民。接着兴国、永修以及南昌附近，也都发现。最近麻疹、天花的流行，在南昌、九江可以说打破了历年纪录！当局对此都满不关心。
    人民虽然在呻吟，在嗷嗷待哺，而政府却摊派了二百万石巨额粮食，拿峡江一个小县说，现在人口只剩三万多，可是征获余粮的数额，也分配到十万石之多。照目前人数，连吃奶的婴儿包括在内，每个人要出三石粮。征粮之外，地方的保甲长都是一条条的吸血虫。距南昌不过二十里的农村保甲长，每月要捐派人民一二千元，南昌近郊的商店，每人每月不论大小买卖，至少也得出捐税一百元。有什么修路费呀，清洁捐呀，就是刚满过周岁的孩子，也要派工修路，不能做就要出钱。
