　　Kuomintang Fascists
    Strengthen Shanghai's Secret Agent Rule
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Shanghai News: The Kuomintang fascists, in order to strengthen their secret agent rule over Shanghai, have recently formulated a so-called "Police Officer Precinct System" by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, which is scheduled to be implemented on June 1st. The method is that each police officer will be responsible for 80 to 120 households or 400 to 600 people within the area of their branch bureau. The main duty of the police officer is to frequently "visit" each household to "understand" everything. The police bureau claims that "its purpose is to "clarify" the situation of each household so that "petty thieves" and "bandits" cannot hide." The police officers responsible for this task, in addition to the 376 recently transferred from the Central Police Officer Training Corps (Note: i.e., the Fuxing Society secret agent training organization), also include 75 selected from the original police chiefs in the city, who will undergo ten days of centralized training and be assigned to various bureaus for internship starting from the 11th of this month. At the same time, the authorities still feel that more than 400 people are not enough to be assigned, and are currently recruiting 150 male police officers and 50 female police officers as supplements.

    加强上海特务统治
    【新华社延安十九日电】沪讯：国民党法西斯派，为加强对上海的特务统治，顷由上海市警察局制定所谓“警员警管区制”，决定于六月一日起实行。其办法为每一警员在分局区域内，管辖八十至一百二十户或四百至六百人，该警员之主要职责，系经常前往各户“访问”一切。据警局宣称：“其作用在“明了”各户情形，俾“宵小”“匪徒”无从匿迹。负责此项任务之警员，除最近由中央警官教导总队（按：即复兴社特务训练机关），调来三百七十六名外，另在本市原有警长中选拔七十五名共同充任，并经过十天集中训练，自本月十一日起分发各局实习。同时，当局仍感四百余名不敷分派，现正进行招收男警员一百五十名，女警员五十名补充。
