　　Suwan Border Region Builds the Huai-Bao Water Conservancy
    Expected to Increase Rice Production by 1.8 Million Shi
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 17th] The Fifth Administrative Office of the Suwan Border Region started water conservancy construction in the Lin and Yangmiao districts of Huaibao County (a newly established county, formerly belonging to Huai'an and Bao) in mid-April. Currently, 660 hectares of waterlogged depressions have been transformed into over 10,000 hectares of drained paddy fields. The remaining acreage can also be drained, with an estimated increase in rice production of 1.82 million shi. The project has employed 59,000 laborers and utilized tools such as drainage pumps and pedal-powered waterwheels to build dams to prevent upstream water from entering the Grand Canal. The project also opened embankment breaches at Pingqiao and Jinghe to allow accumulated water from Huaibao to flow into the river.
