　　The Kuomintang fascist faction has recently dispatched a large number of agents, in collusion with puppet bandits, to infiltrate our liberated areas to carry out assassinations in coordination with their military offensives. This urgently requires serious vigilance.
    In the Jinnan area: Thirty armed agents from En County went to Sunzhuang Village on the night of March 27 to commit atrocities, and our village cadres were brutally beaten. In De County, more than 30 of our stationed troops suffered from water poisoning, with three deaths. When the people of Wei County were rushing to control the river, more than 50 plainclothes members of the puppet bandit Wang Daosheng's unit took the opportunity on the night of April 9, carrying machine guns to Qianpu'an, disguised as the Eighth Route Army, and under the pretext of needing stretchers, broke into civilian houses and looted extensively, kidnapping village chief Li Zhiming and six others. On April 12, more than 40 people with guns continued to Ya'lijie to capture village cadres. On April 27, the traitor agents of Bo Town, Cang County, surrounded our Nanxiakou Industrial and Commercial Office, robbing more than one million yuan of Jicha banknotes and destroying all the furniture in the house. Three cooks from the district office were also kidnapped.
    In addition, a large number of young female agents have been sent to seduce and kill with female charm. According to a female agent captured in Quzhou, they were dispatched from Anyang in a group of dozens, each carrying an American-made electric knife. Those stabbed bleed to death instantly. According to incomplete statistics, in Jun County, 21 people in three villages were killed in this way, more than 200 in Linzhang, and 67 people were killed in the tenth and sixth districts of Anyang alone in early March.
    In the Jin-Lu-Yu area: Neihuang has seen continuous incidents of Kuomintang agents colluding with puppet troops to carry out assassinations in our liberated areas. On April 6, a company from the puppet Neihuang Security Team under Duan Dongmei sneaked into Nanyangwu Village in our Second District, killing Gou Cunyuan, the chairman of the village farmers' association, and Gou Zhishu and Li Zhanggui, members of the farmers' association, and capturing eight militiamen and villagers. On the night of April 12, more than 30 armed agents, posing as our Anyang Detachment, went to the residence of our district joint association and captured four district cadres. On April 24, when Comrade Hu of the county district joint association and Li Lou were holding a mass meeting, 30 plainclothes armed agents with white towels tied on their right arms suddenly came and dispersed the meeting, captured Comrade Hu and the village farmers' association director, and robbed six guns. Xie Yixiang, deputy director of the Feizhuang Farmers' Association in Feng County, was killed by agent Gao Fude on the night of April 11. The agent led six people and went to Yuanji the following night, kidnapped and killed Yuan Jiayin, a businessman from the village. The residence of the militiamen in Chenlou Village, Second District, Qiyu County, was attacked by more than 30 armed agents. The militiamen rose up to defend themselves and fought for an hour before repelling them. According to incomplete statistics, recently in Jining, Heze, Puyang, Kunwu, Kunshan, and other counties, a total of eleven village cadres have been assassinated, ten robbery incidents, six extortion incidents, and three attacks on institutions have occurred. Recently, a plainclothes special agent team was discovered in Jining, directly led by the Jinan Special Agent Agency, divided into political and special agent teams, and further divided into eight groups, operating independently. The heads of its 112th group, Shan Zuojing and Qiu Wochen, have been captured by the government.
    In the Taihang area: In the Zhenbie (identification) work in Guai'er Town, Zuoquan, special agents who had not been noticed in the past were found to have infiltrated our various work departments to carry out sabotage. It is estimated that there is a special agent group in the militia and a special agent group in the economic department. When the Fifth District of Heshun held a district and village cadre meeting, three village cadres were poisoned to death.
