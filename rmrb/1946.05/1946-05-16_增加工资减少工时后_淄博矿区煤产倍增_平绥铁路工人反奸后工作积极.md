　　After Wage Increases and Reduced Working Hours
    Zibo Mining Area Coal Production Doubles
    Workers on the Ping-Sui Railway are Highly Motivated After Anti-Traitor Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 12th] Coal production in the Zichuan and Boshan mining areas is increasing daily. The daily output of the Xinqing Coal Mine Company has increased from 265 tons to 630 tons. Zichuan Coal Mine Company increased from over 100 tons to 400 tons. Xinbo Coal Mine Company increased from 126 tons to 200 tons. The Xihe Coal Mine Company increased from 150 tons to 500 tons. The main reasons why various companies can quickly recover and increase production after the serious destruction by the enemy and puppets are: (1) Workers' wages have been increased, with a daily subsidy of nine and a half catties of fine grain per person; (2) Mining time has been changed to ten hours, fire prevention devices are installed in the No. 2 coal mine, and stone walls are built to prevent water disasters; boiled water is delivered by elevators, and various health care equipment are enhanced; wages are directly paid to workers, and labor affairs sections and other entities that exploited workers in the past have been abolished. The most loyal employees in each company are appointed to be responsible for work. Due to the implementation of the above reforms, workers' coal mining efficiency has improved compared to before, with per capita output increasing by 40% per shift.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Fengzhen, 10th] Railway workers of Ping-Sui have undergone 37 revenge and liquidation campaigns against traitors, pseudo-elements, and labor scabs in the past six months, with the participation of more than 1,000 employees. A total of more than 400,000 catties of grain and more than 200,000 yuan in local currency have been calculated. In order to further improve workers' lives, the trade union has established 18 workers' cooperatives between every five stations. At Pingdiquan Station, more than 300 employees automatically raised 620,000 yuan to open a "Transportation Passenger and Freight Station". The trade union has also organized workers' families to engage in production. After the improvement of employees' lives, their enthusiasm has greatly increased. In addition to working eight hours a day, they also spend two hours studying politics, culture, and business. Workers' reading groups and business drama clubs have been established between various sections and stations. In the past, 2.5 track repair workers were needed per kilometer, but now only 1.5 people are needed. Repair workers used simple tools to repair one locomotive and four carriages.

　　增加工资减少工时后
    淄博矿区煤产倍增
    平绥铁路工人反奸后工作积极
    【新华社博山十二日电】淄川、博山矿区煤炭产量日增，新庆煤矿公司每日产量由二百六十五吨，增至六百三十吨。淄川煤矿公司，由一百余吨增至四百吨。新博煤矿公司，由一百二十六吨增至二百吨。西河煤矿公司由一百五十吨增至五百吨。各公司所以能在敌伪严重破坏后迅速恢复，增加产量，其主要原因，为：（一）工人增加了工资，每人每日津贴为九斤半细粮，（，）采矿时间改为十小时二炭井内设防火器，并砌石墙以防水患，用升降车送开水，增强了各种卫生保健设备，工资直接发给工人，取消了过去统治剥削工人的劳务科等，由各公司委任最忠实于业务的职工负责工作。由于实现了上述改革，工人采煤效率较前提高，每人每工增产达百分之四十。
    【新华社丰镇十日电】平绥铁路工人，半年来共经反奸伪工贼的复仇清算运动三拾七次，参加员工一千余人，共算出粮食四十余万斤，本币廿余万元。工会为进一步改善工人生活，在每五个车站间建立了十八个工人合作社，平地泉车站，三百多员工，自动集股六十二万元，开设“交通客货栈”，工会并组织工人家属进行生产。员工生活改善后，积极性大大提高，每日工作八小时外，尚有两小时从事政治文化与业务学习。各段站间，均已成立工人读报组和业务剧社，过去每公里需两个半修道工人，现在只要一个半人。修理工人用简陋的工具，修好了一辆机车、四个车皮。
