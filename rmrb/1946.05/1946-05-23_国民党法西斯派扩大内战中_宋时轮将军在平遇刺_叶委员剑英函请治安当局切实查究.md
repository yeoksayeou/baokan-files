　　Kuomintang Fascists Expand Civil War
    General Song Shilun Assassinated in Beiping
    Committee Member Ye Jianying Sends Letter Requesting Thorough Investigation by Security Authorities
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an Twentieth Dispatch] Beiping dispatch: Song Shilun, Major General and Chief of the Communist Party Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department, was assassinated in Beiping on the 15th, fortunately without injury. At 6:45 p.m. that afternoon, General Song was returning to the Beijing Hotel from Beixin Street in car number 10846. When the car passed the south entrance of Bamiancao near Dengshikou, the traffic was very slow due to the crowded area. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly attacked by thugs ambushed there. A small hole was shot through the several-minute-thick glass of Song's car, but fortunately, Song was not injured. The driver, Su Qingshan, immediately accelerated and drove Song back to the Beijing Hotel at high speed. Afterwards, the Communist Party sent personnel to report to the Police Bureau. The Bureau Chief, Chen Zhuo, along with the Head of the Judicial Section and ballistics expert Ju Zengyu, went to inspect the bullet marks on the car. According to Mr. Ju's identification, the shots were fired from the front of the car using a No. 3 Browning pistol. At the same time, Committee Member Ye Jianying of the Military Mediation Department also sent letters to the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Police Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation. Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party in the Military Mediation Department, also informed the American member Robertson and Kuomintang Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi of the assassination attempt on Song. Because the matter concerned the assassination of an important member of the Executive Headquarters, Luo suggested that the Executive Headquarters make a serious representation to the responsible security authorities to thoroughly investigate. The assassination attempt on General Song Shilun is clearly related to the current deterioration of the national political situation and the full-scale expansion of the civil war by the Kuomintang fascists, and has therefore attracted close attention from all parties.

    【新华社延安二十日电】北平讯：军调部中共方面执行处长宋时轮少将，十五日在平遇刺，幸未中伤。是日下午六时四十五分，宋将军由北新街乘坐一零八四六号汽车回返北京饭店，道经灯市口附近的八面槽南口时，因地区热闹，车行甚缓，不料突遭预伏该处的暴徒开枪行刺，宋车后数分厚的玻璃被射一小孔，宋氏幸未受伤，司机苏庆善即急开足速率，将宋氏飞速送回北京饭店。事后中共方面即派员报告警察总局，由局长陈焯率同司法科长及研究弹道之技士鞠增钰，前往检验车上弹痕，据鞠技士鉴定，系用三号勃郎林手枪由车前射击者。同时军调部叶委员剑英，亦即分函警备司令部、市政府、及警察总局，请予切实查究。军调部中共方面参谋长罗瑞卿，亦将宋氏遇刺经过，分别告知美方委员饶伯森及国民党方面参谋长蔡文治，并因事关谋刺执行部重要人员，罗氏提议由执行部向负责治安当局严重交涉，彻底查究。宋时轮将军此次遇刺，显与目前全国政治局势恶化，国民党法西斯派全力扩大内战有关，故已引起各方密切注意。
