　　【Xinhua News Agency, Handan】Before the war, the iron industry in Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Gaoping had over 400,000 workers. After eight years of cruel destruction by the Japanese invaders, only 20,000 workers remained. For the last four years, they had no new clothes. Since our army liberated the area, and because our democratic government is actively engaged in peaceful construction and taking care of the interests of both labor and management, 100,000 workers have now resumed work. This summer, 80% of the workers have new clothes. The workers cheered: "Under the leadership of the democratic government, if we work hard, we will find a way to live!" Other ironworkers are also actively resuming work.

　　晋城铁工十万复业
    【新华社邯郸讯】抗战前拥有四十余万工人的晋城、阳城、高平的铁业。在日寇八年残酷摧残下。仅除两万工人，后四年完全没有换上新衣。经我军解放后，由于我民主政府积极从事和平建设，照顾劳资双方利益，现已有十万工人复工，今夏有百分之八十的工人换上新衣，工人们欢呼着：“民主政府领导下，自己好好干，生活就有办法。”其他铁业工人亦正在积极复工中。
