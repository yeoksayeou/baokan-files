　　Jilu-Yu Daily
    Summarizes One Year of Correspondence Work
    Linze and Eight Other Counties Awarded Medals
    [Our Newspaper, Heze News] Recently, the Jilu-Yu Daily社 (Daily)社 summarized one year of correspondence work and commended model correspondents. Linze, Juancheng, Ningyang, Nanle, Guancheng, Puyang, Weihe, and Shan-Yu and other eight counties were awarded silver medals. Since the correspondence movement in Nanle last spring promoted the development of work, improved the cultural level of cadres, and also promoted upper-level comrades to further delve into work and strengthen investigation and research, the correspondence work in Guancheng, under the leadership of Political Commissar Li, also developed. Political Commissar Li revised manuscripts for correspondents until midnight, and cadres throughout the county launched a "one article movement." Subsequently, Puyang, Linze, Weihe, Juancheng, Ningyang, and Shan-Yu each submitted more than one hundred articles per month. Linze submitted one hundred and eighty articles in March. During last year's counter-offensive, great advance, production, and mass movements, correspondents throughout the region wrote nearly ten thousand articles, shouting out the voices of the people. The Jilu-Yu Daily recently called in an editorial, "Vigorously develop correspondence work to promote the current mass movement," urging "every correspondent to establish the writing concept of serving the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to improve further, without any pride or complacency." The newspaper also awarded one hundred silver medals and five thousand sheets of manuscript paper to nine hundred model correspondents and their leaders. The District Party Committee has now decided to open a correspondence work training class, which opened on May 15th.

　　冀鲁豫日报
    总结一年通讯工作
    临泽等八县荣获奖章
    【本报荷泽讯】最近冀鲁豫日报社总结一年通讯工作，嘉奖模范通讯员，临泽、鄄城、宁阳、南乐、观城、濮县、卫河、单虞等八县，荣获银质奖章。自去春南乐的通讯运动促进了工作的开展，提高了干部文化水平，也促进了上层同志更加深入工作，加强调查研究后，继之观城的通讯工作在李政委领导下，开展起来。李政委曾给通讯员改稿到半夜，全县干部掀起了“一篇稿运动”。接着濮县、临泽、卫河、鄄城、宁阳、单虞各县，每月均来稿百件以上，临泽三月份来稿一百八十篇，在去年的反攻大进军和生产、群运中，全区通讯员写了将近一万件稿，喊出了人民的呼声。冀鲁豫日报近在“以大力开展通讯工作，推动当前群众运动”的社论中，号召“每个通讯员，树立为工农兵广大群众服务的写作观念，并要求提高一步，不能有任何骄傲与自满。”报纸并以银质奖章一百枚，稿纸五千份，奖与九百个模范通讯员及其领导者，现区党委已决定开办通讯工作训练班，五月十五日已开学。
