　　机关 Production of the Border Government and Central Bureau
    Li Zhuang
    The border region-level organs moved to Handan. The people of Handan then saw more ordinary yet novel things. Whenever the setting sun leaned against the mountains, groups of staff members wearing "Border Region Government" badges and blue uniforms, carrying hoes and manure buckets, went from the city to the suburbs. At dusk, they returned with cheerful and weary steps.
    The citizens felt extraordinarily surprised by this: "How can they still be doing these things!" These well-intentioned people may not be very clear that the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War were endured through such arduous fighting, work, and production. Anti-Japanese military and government personnel shed a lot of blood and sweat to defeat the Japanese invaders. Now that victory has been achieved, the common people are still very poor due to the enemy's and puppet's eight years of exploitation. Therefore, the government decided to launch a large-scale production movement to reduce the burden on the people. Each odd-job worker in the border government only receives four yuan for food expenses per day. Four yuan can now only buy half a catty of bean sprouts or enough coal to cook one meal. Everything else must be solved through self-production.
    In the midst of busy work, this is obviously a heavy burden. But the people who are determined to "serve the people" bravely bear it. In addition to the overall organ production, the border government requires each person to produce and turn over 2,700 yuan this year. The Central Bureau's production plan pointed out a clear direction, their total production task is ×××10,000 yuan, and commercial production only accounts for 18%. That is to say, to complete 82% of the production task depends on their own labor.
    The plan is being carried out intensely. The border government's organ land has been planted with 132 mu, most of which is cotton. They transported soil and carried bricks for public construction sites, earning more than 100,000 yuan, completing one-tenth of the entire task. The most active comrades have already completed 1,700 yuan. The Department of Education has only eighteen people, and they planted four mu of cotton and two mu of vegetables themselves. There are only two hours or so of labor time each day, and the residence is more than half a kilometer away from the farm. It is obviously not easy to cultivate so much land under such conditions. But according to current estimates, the vegetable garden harvest alone can complete the private production task. The Central Bureau planted 110 mu of land, and continuously transports bricks and contracts projects. The female comrades spin cotton, coupled with the organ's transportation, workshops, commercial production and other projects, it is estimated that the task can also be completed satisfactorily.
    Before coming to Handan and after arriving in Handan, party, government, and military leaders frequently reminded their cadres to prevent waste and be vigilant against hedonistic thoughts. I simply visited the production situation of various organs, and everyone still maintains the glorious tradition of hard struggle during the Anti-Japanese War. Despite the difficulties such as relocation, lack of land, and frequent cadre transfers, relying on eight years of training and experience, production is being carried out enthusiastically.
    Taking the border government as an example: before moving to Handan, Chairman Yang mobilized all cadres for arduous production. Chairman Yang and Rong also have production tasks. They exchanged labor with cadres and odd-job personnel, and turned over all manuscript fees. Some general affairs personnel went to Handan in advance to prepare. Before finding land, everyone planned to contract projects for others first. After finding land, they immediately grasped the farming season for agricultural production. They established a production committee, strictly divided the work, some specialized in contacting contracted projects, and some were responsible for preparing agricultural tools and seeds. The production team under the committee directly led the production personnel. Everyone had production training and had obtained production benefits. After the call and organization leadership of the leaders, they immediately took action.

　　边府、中央局的机关生产
    李庄
    边区一级的机关搬到了邯郸。邯郸人于是看到了更多平凡而又新奇的事情。每当夕阳傍山的时候，一群群挂着“边区政府”证章和穿着蓝色制服的工作人员，荷锄担粪，从市内去到郊外去。黄昏，他们又迈着愉快而疲惫的步子赶回来。
    市民们对这件事感到分外的惊奇：“怎么他们还干这些事！”这些好心的人也许还不很清楚，八年的抗战就是在这样艰苦的打仗、工作与生产中熬过去的。抗日的军政人员为战胜日寇而流了大量的血汗。现在胜利了，可是由于敌伪八年压榨，老百姓依然十分困苦，政府于是决定了开展大生产运动，减轻人民负担的方针。边府每个工杂人员每天只发四元菜金。四元钱在现在只能买半斤豆芽或作熟一顿饭的煤炭。其他一切都要靠自己生产解决。
    在繁忙的工作中，这显然是个沉重的担子。但是决心为“人民服务”的人们勇敢的承受了它。边府除了整个的机关生产外，今年每人要生产交公两千七百元。中央局的生产计划指出了一个明确的方向，他们的生产总任务是×××万元，商业生产只占百分之十八。就是说，完成百分之八十二的生产任务要靠自己的劳力。
    计划在紧张的进行着。边府的机关土地已下种一百三十二亩，其中大部是棉花，他们给进行公共建筑的场所运土抬砖，先后赚了十多万元，已完成整个任务的十分之一，最积极的同志已经完成一千七百元。教育厅只有十八个人，自己种了四亩棉花两亩菜。每天只有两点多钟的劳作时间，驻地离农场又有一里多路。这样的条件耕种这样多的土地，显然很不容易。但据现在的估计，只是菜地收获就能完成私人生产任务。中央局种了一百一十亩地，还不断运砖、包工，女同志们纺棉花，再加上机关的运输、作坊，商业生产等项目，估计也能圆满的完成任务。
    来邯前和到邯郸以后，党政军首长们经常提醒自己的干部：防止浪费、警惕享乐思想。我简单的访问各机关的生产情况，大家依然保持着抗战中艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，尽管有搬家、缺乏土地、干部调动频繁等困难，但依靠着八年的锻炼和经验，生产是热烈的搞起来了。
    就以边府为例：在搬来邯郸以前，杨主席就向全体干部作了艰苦生产的动员。杨、戎主席同样有生产任务，他们和干部与杂务人员变工，并缴出全部稿费。一些总务人员事先到邯郸作准备。在没有找到土地之前，大家有计划的先给人家包工，找到土地之后，马上抓紧农时进行农业生产。他们建立了生产委员会，严密的分了工，有的专门接洽包工，有的负责准备农具种籽。委员会下的生产小组直接领导生产人员，大家都是有了生产锻炼且得到过生产利益的，经过首长的号召与组织领导，立刻就行动起来了。
