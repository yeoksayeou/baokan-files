　　【本报长治讯】辉北全县八十六村，一月来有六十三村开展了翻身斗争。进行查减的二十九村，反奸的二十一村，反贪污、反恶霸的三十三村。原有的二十三个落后村中，有十八村打开了局面。过去素称封建地主堡垒的西平罗村统治集团被群众打垮了。三十多家佃户都减了租。龙王庙的曲子佩与山怀村的崔祖严等勾结敌伪杀害群众的汉奸特务，在群众控诉与要求下，由政府执行枪决，并缴出私藏的长短枪四十五枝。领导上在这一时期，克服了包办代替作风，执行了放手发展方针。在大村，展开由小发展到大规模的斗争；在分散的小庄，采取了分散的一边酝酿诉苦，一边斗争解决问题的办法。现在群众与干部情绪都很高，决心争取在麦收前将运动贯彻到底，做到不留尾巴。

[Our dispatch from Changzhi] In Huibei County, 63 out of 86 villages have launched struggles for emancipation in the past month. Twenty-nine villages have carried out rent investigation and reduction, twenty-one villages have opposed traitors, and thirty-three villages have opposed corruption and local bullies. Among the original twenty-three backward villages, eighteen have broken through the situation. The ruling clique of Xipingluo Village, which was known as a feudal landlord stronghold, has been overthrown by the masses. More than 30 tenant households have reduced their rent. Qu Zipei of Longwangmiao and Cui Zuyan of Shanhua Village, who colluded with the enemy and puppets to murder the masses, were executed by the government at the request and indictment of the masses, and 45 privately hidden rifles and pistols were confiscated. During this period, the leadership overcame the work style of monopolizing everything and instead implemented the policy of letting go and developing. In large villages, struggles have developed from small to large scale; in scattered small villages, a decentralized approach has been adopted, with both brewing grievances and struggling to solve problems. Now, the masses and cadres are in high spirits and determined to thoroughly implement the movement before the wheat harvest, ensuring that no loose ends are left.
