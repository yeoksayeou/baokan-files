　　【Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 14th】Kuomintang authorities in various locations continue to forcibly conscript soldiers and expand their armies. Near the agricultural experiment station outside Tong County, the so-called "Hebei Guerrilla Force" has recently been established, commanded by Liu Fenglin, the former railway protection commander stationed in Mentouqi, with Yu Jiwen as the deputy commander. The planned quota is 17,000 people, and over 2,000 people have already been captured and formed into three regiments, each with varying sizes of five to six hundred soldiers. The Kuomintang authorities in Shijiazhuang have also recently established an "Obligatory Police Brigade," simultaneously capturing and forcibly enlisting people, requiring two able-bodied men from each small village. The puppet Song Yuzhou's troops, stationed in Anguang, Tianjin, are forcibly conscripting soldiers everywhere, with ninety-six people being taken from Wubu Village. The puppet Zhu Xianyi's troops have expanded their reactionary armed self-defense corps.
