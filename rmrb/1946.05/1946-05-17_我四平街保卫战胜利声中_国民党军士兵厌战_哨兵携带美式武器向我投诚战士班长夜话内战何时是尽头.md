　　Amidst the Victory of Our Siping Campaign
    Kuomintang Soldiers are Weary of War
    Sentry Carries American Weapons to Defect to Us; Warrior Squad Leader Chats Late at Night About When the Civil War Will End
    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 14th] Our correspondent Chen Yi reports: The Kuomintang army attacking Siping Street has begun to show signs of war-weariness. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, Zhang Mingxiu and Ding Wenfang, privates from the third squad of the first platoon of the eighth company of the third battalion of the 272nd Regiment of the 91st Division of the 71st Army, carrying two American-made rifles and over a hundred rounds of ammunition, voluntarily ran to the Eighth Route Army position of the Democratic Allied Forces north of Bamiancheng, and requested living expenses to return home. They said, "As early as in our hometown of Rugao County, Jiangsu, we knew that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are good armies that love the country and the people, so this time when we saw that the opposite side on the battlefield was the Eighth Route Army, we took the opportunity during sentry duty to run over." Similar war-weariness is also brewing in the New First Army on the front line of Siping Street. Because the two armies' positions are very close, only fifty meters apart, whenever the night is quiet and the sound of gunfire is sparse, one can faintly hear the Kuomintang soldiers and squad leaders talking in the bunkers. One soldier said, "When will this war of fighting ourselves end? Wouldn't it be better for us to leave?" The squad leader replied despairingly, "We are surrounded like an iron bucket, where can we run to?" When the New First Army attacks, the wounded and dead are often abandoned on the battlefield. As long as the gunfire stops briefly and there is calm and stillness, one can hear the tragic cries of the soldiers in the New First Army positions, sometimes even being eaten by dogs. Seeing this tragic situation, the commanders and fighters of the Democratic Allied Forces often risk going to bury them or provide treatment, and distribute leaflets to the New First Army, asking them to bury the bodies and drag back the wounded soldiers. As long as they do not carry weapons, the Democratic Allied Forces will never shoot. Peng Zhiyuan, the lieutenant company deputy of the Second Company of the Engineer Battalion of the 17th Division, who laid down his weapons, said, "What pains me the most is that no one cares about the bodies and the wounded on the battlefield. What I admire and am most moved by is that you Eighth Route Army, no matter how dangerous it is, always pull down the bodies and the wounded of the soldiers, regardless of your own sacrifice." As for the more than ten thousand Kuomintang officers and soldiers liberated by the Democratic Allied Forces, they expressed their absolute unwillingness to have a civil war. Wang Huamin, senior staff officer of the 71st Army, Ding Guozhu, battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the 233rd Regiment of the 91st Division of the 71st Army, Luo Yanxiong, deputy commander of the 166th Regiment of the 19th Division of the 13th Army, Guo Chaosheng, battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the 260th Regiment of the 84th Division of the 71st Army, Zhu Zhiye, company commander of the 84th Company of the 113th Regiment of the 38th Division of the New First Army, etc., when they met each other, the first thing they said was: "It is a huge mistake for the Kuomintang to come to the Northeast to fight a civil war!" Therefore, before they left our army, they jointly wrote a letter to their officers and soldiers, telling them not to fight any more civil wars and make worthless bloodshed sacrifices.

　　我四平街保卫战胜利声中
    国民党军士兵厌战
    哨兵携带美式武器向我投诚战士班长夜话内战何时是尽头
    【新华社四平街十四日电】本社记者陈沂报导：进攻四平街之国民党军，现已开始发生厌战情绪，上月三十日下午，七十一军九十一师二七二团三营八连一排三班一等兵张明秀、丁文芳二人，携带美式步枪两枝，子弹百余发，自动跑至我八面城北民主联军阵地，并要求发给养费回家，他们说：“早在自己的家乡江苏如皋县，就知道八路军新四军是爱国爱民的好军队，所以这一次见到战场上对面是八路军，就乘放哨的机会跑过来了。”类此厌战情绪，同样在四平街前线的新一军中酝酿着，因为两军阵地相距甚近，只隔五十米达，每当夜静更深，枪声稀疏时，可以隐约听到躺在地堡里的国民党军士兵和班长谈话，一个士兵说：“这个自己打自己的仗，那天才是尽头呢？我们走不好吗？”班长绝望地回答：“四面被包围得像铁桶一样，跑到那里去？”新一军在攻击时受到伤亡，伤号和尸体往往被遗弃在战场上，只要枪声稍停与无风沉静时，便可以听到新一军阵地士兵悲惨的哭叫声，有时甚至被狗咬食，民主联军指战员睹此惨状，常冒险前往掩埋或治疗，并散发传单给新一军，请他们掩埋尸体，拖回伤兵，只要不带武器，民主联军绝不射击。但由于国民党高级军官的残忍无情，迄今仍置之不顾。放下武器的×十七师工兵营二连中尉连副彭志远说：“我最痛心的是在战场上尸体伤号没人管，我最感佩和最感动的，是你们八路军无论在什么危险的时候，不顾牺牲自己，总要把战士尸体和伤号拉下来”至于被民主联军解放的万余国民党军官兵，他们表示绝不愿意内战。七十一军上校高级参谋王化民，七十一军九十一师二三三团二营营长丁国柱，十三军十九师一六六团副团长罗彦雄，七十一军八十四师二六○团二营营长郭朝升，新一军三十八师一一三团八四连连长朱执业等，彼此见面，第一句话就说：“国民党到东北来打内战，是一个绝大错误！”为此，他们在离开我军临行前，曾联名写信给他们的长官和士兵，告诉他们不要再打内战而作无价值的流血牺牲。
