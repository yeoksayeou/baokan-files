　　Kuomintang Authorities Deliberately Delay and Obstruct the Executive Group from Going to Eastern Henan for Mediation
    [Handan, 20th dispatch] The Eastern Henan Executive Group, en route to Eastern Henan for mediation, was repeatedly obstructed by the Kuomintang. Upon arriving in Zhengzhou on the 13th, the Kuomintang side used the excuse of having matters to attend to in order to delay them for a day. On the 14th, upon arriving in Zhongmu, the Kuomintang side fabricated the story that the Yellow River Railway Bridge in Kaifeng was broken, causing them to return to Zhengzhou. On the 15th, they rerouted south of Xinxiang, passing through Xiaoji Town, to reach Kaifeng. On the same day, the American side had already agreed to go to Eastern Henan the next day, and they could arrive at Fujii (south of Qi County) on the 17th. That evening, the Kuomintang side again requested to inspect Dongming first before going to Eastern Henan. After our representative, Colonel Li Jingyi, exposed this conspiracy one by one, the Kuomintang side still insisted on going to Dongming first. This kind of deliberate delaying, shifting the target, by the Kuomintang authorities, in order to facilitate their troops' "encirclement and suppression" of the Eastern Henan Liberated Area, is truly worthy of the nation's deep attention.

　　国民党当局故意拖延时间留难执行小组赴豫东调处
    【邯郸二十日电】赴豫东调处之豫东执行组，途中遭国民党多方阻难，十三日抵郑州，国方借口有事拖延一天。十四日至中牟，国方又捏造开封黄河铁桥已断，复返回郑州。十五日改道经新乡以南之小冀镇抵开封。当日美方已应次日赴豫东，十七日可抵傅集（杞县南），至晚国方又要求先去东明视察，然后赴豫东，此中阴谋，经我代表李静宜上校一一揭穿后，国方依然要先去东明。国民党当局此种故意拖延时间，转移目标，以便利其部队对豫东解放区之“进剿”，实堪国人深刻注意。
