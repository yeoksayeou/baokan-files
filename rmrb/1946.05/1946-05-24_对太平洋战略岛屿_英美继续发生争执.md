　　On Strategic Islands in the Pacific
    Disputes Between Britain and the United States Continue
    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Recently, disputes between Britain and the United States over the handling of strategic islands in the Pacific and the future of Japan have continued. Since the United States proposed that it should obtain sovereignty over three British islands in the Southwest Pacific, it has aroused opposition from British newspapers. Subsequently, the British government also conditionally rejected this U.S. demand. According to Reuters, it is rumored that British Foreign Secretary Bevin informed U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes in Paris that if the United States is willing to jointly participate in the South Pacific with Britain and New Zealand, the British government may be willing to give these three islands to the United States as bases; however, this does not include so-called British abandonment of sovereignty over the area, and Britain can still use the area as a base at the same time. According to a London dispatch from Marshall, a reporter for the Chicago Sun, Britain and the United States have engaged in secret negotiations on the future of Japan, but the opinions of the two countries are very different. Britain believes that the United States is being too lenient with Japanese industry. Britain advocates that Japan's shipbuilding industry must be completely prohibited, or the equipment that could be used to build ocean-going ships must be prohibited, but the United States insists on its established policy.

　　对太平洋战略岛屿
    英美继续发生争执
    【新华社延安二十日电】最近英美对太平洋战略岛屿的处理，与日本之未来问题，继续发生争执，自美国提出应获得西南太平洋英三个岛屿的主权后，曾引起英国各报的反对，继之英政府亦有条件的拒绝美国此种要求。据路透社称：传闻英外相贝文在巴黎曾通知美国务卿贝纳斯称：如果美国愿意与英国及新西兰共同参加南太平洋，英政府可能愿将此三岛给予美国作为基地；但这并不包括所谓英国放弃该地主权，而且英国同时仍能利用该地作为基地。另据芝加哥太阳报记者马氏伦敦讯：英美已就日本之未来问题，从事秘密谈判，然两国意见殊为分歧。英认为美对日本工业过分宽大，英主张日本之造船工业必须完全禁止或禁止其可能建造远洋船只之设备，但美国则坚持既定政策。
