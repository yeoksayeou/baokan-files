　　In the spring ploughing movement in Piancheng, the following experiences were gained: (1) Retain mass commercial production and closely integrate agriculture and commerce. In the new small-scale cooperatives within the Mabu and Luanshiyan mutual aid societies, experienced people are selected to engage in commercial production, and their land is taken care of by the mutual aid group. Their slogan is: "Make the best use of everyone's talents, do what you are good at." Therefore, the masses all participate in mutual aid. (2) Agricultural loans should be used in a concentrated manner. The 30,000 yuan loan in Xiyu was lent to 15 poor peasant households who jointly bought a donkey. On this basis, they organized themselves. (3) Use concrete facts to dispel the masses' confused thinking. In the past, the masses in Mabu believed that "whoever becomes rich will be struggled against." Recently, at a mass meeting, the fact that Wen Qingyu, a rich peasant in the village, was not struggled against was used to educate the masses. The masses then realized that "as long as you sweat yourself, eat your own food, wear your own clothes, and do not exploit others, there is no problem." (4) Actively support the ultra-poor to establish obligations. After discussion by the villagers in Hou Xiyu, the mutual aid group collectively cultivated wasteland for the ultra-poor, and the ultra-poor repaid the labor with rice work. Ultra-poor women spun cotton, and the cooperative lent her a catty of cotton as capital. This corrected the practice of simple relief and helped the ultra-poor and developed production.

　　偏城春耕运动中
    获得四点经验
    【本报长治讯】偏城在春耕运动中，获得如下几点经验：（一）保留群众商业生产，密切农商业结合。马布、乱石岩互助社内新的小型合作社，选出有经验的人做商业生产，他的地由互助组照顾。他们的口号是：“人尽其材，会啥作啥”。因此群众都参加互助。（二）农业贷款要集中使用，西峪三万元贷款贷给十五户贫农，合买了一头驴，他们在这个基础上，便组织起来。（三）用具体事实解除群众糊涂思想。马布群众过去认为“谁富了就要斗争谁”，最近，群众大会上，拿本村富农温庆余并没被斗争的事实，教育群众，群众才认识到“只要流自己汗、吃自己饭、穿自己衣、不剥削人，甚问题也没有”。（四）从积极方面扶助赤贫建立义务。后西峪经过村民讨论，互助组集体给赤贫开荒，赤贫按米工还工。赤贫妇女纺花，合作社贷给她一斤花的本。这样改正了单纯救济的作法，以扶助赤贫，发展了生产。
