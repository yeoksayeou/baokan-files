　　Allied Headquarters Actually Approved
    Shidehara's Recommendation of Yoshida as Prime Minister
    Far Eastern Commission Holds Meeting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th] Tokyo dispatch: Foreign Minister Yoshida accepted the position of President of the Liberal Party on the morning of the 15th, which has achieved the first step of Shidehara's plan to put Yoshida on the stage. Then, at 4:30 p.m. on the same day, Shidehara convened a meeting of the leaders of the Progressive Party, the Liberal Party, and the National Cooperative Party. After reaching an agreement, Shidehara went to the Imperial Palace to recommend Yoshida as the new Prime Minister and obtained the approval of Allied Headquarters. All indications show that the Yoshida Cabinet will be a reactionary coalition cabinet of the Liberal Party, the National Cooperative Party, and the Progressive Party.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th] Washington dispatch: The Far Eastern Commission held its eleventh meeting here on the 13th and issued a statement on several standards for the implementation of the new Japanese constitution and preliminary compensation policies. The statement stipulated that the implementation of the new Japanese constitution must ensure that the finally promulgated constitution is indeed an expression of the free will of the Japanese people. To this end, there must be sufficient time and opportunity for detailed discussion and consideration of the new constitution's provisions. The statement decided that all Japanese arsenals, aircraft, and light metal industrial equipment, with certain restrictions, should be handed over to pay for reparations. In order to smash the Japanese Zaibatsu groups, it has been decided to first use Mitsui and Mitsubishi for reparations.

　　盟军总部竟然批准
    币原捧吉田为首相
    远东委员会举行会议
    【新华社延安十六日电】东京讯：外相吉田已于十五日晨接受自由党总裁之职，这已达到了币原捧吉田登台的第一个步骤。接着在当天下午四时半，币原召开进步党、自由党、及国民协同党三党首脑会议，待达到协议后，币原即赴皇宫推荐吉田为新首相，并取得盟军总部批准。所有象征，表明吉田内阁将为自由党、国民协同党、及进步党的反动联合内阁。
    【新华社延安十六日电】华府讯：远东委员会十三日在此间举行第十一次会议，并发表施行日本新宪法之若干标准及初步赔偿政策之声明，声明规定日本新宪法之施行，必须能保证最后颁布之宪法确系日本人民自由意志之表现。为此须有充分之时间与机会，以便详细讨论及考虑新宪法条文。声明决定，日本所有之兵工厂飞机及轻金属工业设备，除某种限制外，应一律交出，抵付赔偿，并为粉碎日本财阀集团起见，已决定首先以三井、三菱作为赔偿之用。
