　　Recovering from the Wounds of War
    People of Southern Hebei and Taihang Rebuild New Homes
    [Our newspaper's Handan dispatch] The people of Southern Hebei and Taihang are engaged in large-scale construction, building new houses and recovering from the wounds of the eight-year war. In Qicun Town, Pingxiang, Southern Hebei, many houses were destroyed during the enemy's rule. In Zhengjiazhuang, all 130 houses along one street were completely destroyed. After our army liberated Pingxiang, the democratic government immediately provided loans of 130,000 yuan to help the people of the whole town rebuild. Now, after a concentrated effort of sowing seeds, the people of the town have built 160 new houses from the ruins, and another 245 rooms under construction will soon be completed. In the Seventh District of Yuanchao, this area's 39 villages have also built 800 new houses. In the old liberated area of Licheng in the Taihang Mountains, thanks to the people listening to the government last year and universally planting cotton with profitable results, villages are also actively building new houses. In Langzhuang Village, with 83 households, 270 houses were destroyed during the war. Last year, 160 mu of cotton were planted, and the entire village earned 1.2 million yuan, with every household having sufficient food and clothing. Since January, 18 spacious two-story buildings and 27 tile-roofed houses have been newly built. It is now planned to continue building eight more two-story buildings, eighteen flat houses, and eighteen cave dwellings. Mafang Town in the newly liberated He Shun was extremely prosperous before the war. After the enemy occupied Mafang, the town was completely reduced to rubble, becoming an uninhabited area. After liberation last year, the democratic government immediately launched a fundraising and relief campaign throughout the district. Sixty people who had fled are now returning to the town. Currently, with the help of government loans, they are rebuilding their homes.
