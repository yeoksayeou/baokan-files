　　Our Army's Position on Siping Street Stands Firm as a Mountain
    Kuomintang Troops Face Dilemma
    Frontline Commanders and Fighters Firmly Believe: "Siping Street Will Always Be Ours!"
    [New China News Agency, Siping Street, 13th dispatch] Our agency reporter Chen Yi reports: The defense of Siping Street has been going on for nearly four weeks. Thanks to the heroic resistance of our defending troops and the skillful maneuvers of our outer line troops, our army's position remains unshaken. The New First Army is now in a dilemma. Except for a炮战炮 battle between the two sides on the night of the 9th, when the Democratic Allied Army bombarded and destroyed one or two relatively prominent high red-roofed buildings of the Kuomintang army, the entire front has been in a stalemate in recent days. Although Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security, personally commands the New First Army and supervises the battle at Shuangmiazi (40 li south of Siping Street), he cannot change this situation. The invading army is now facing difficulties in supply. Even sorghum rice is hard to come by. Soldiers are only given 20 yuan per day, but there is nothing to buy. They are looting beans from the people to satisfy their hunger. On the 8th, on the southeast front of Siping Street, a platoon leader even said to the defending soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army: "Please don't shoot, I am willing to crawl over to talk to you." The defending soldiers generously allowed it. The platoon leader crawled over and asked: "How long are you going to defend?" The soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army replied: "Until you stop attacking!" The platoon leader crawled back dejectedly. The Democratic Allied Army has high morale. The commanders and fighters who are holding the front lines wrote to Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army: "Siping Street will always be ours!" The order in Siping Street is also extremely stable. The city gates have been opened, and residents can travel freely. Market transactions are carried out on time, and farmers from the surrounding countryside transport grain and vegetables. The Liaoxi and Liaobei Democratic Allied Army Frontline Headquarters have sent comfort groups carrying large quantities of goods to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. The New First Army is currently reorganizing its troops, ordering them to save ammunition as much as possible in preparation for future decisive battles. At the same time, they are strengthening the surveillance of the soldiers and waiting for reinforcements from Shenyang.

　　四平街我军阵地屹立如山
    国民党军进退两难
    前线指战员坚信：“四平街永远是我们的”！
    【新华社四平街十三日电】本社记者陈沂报导：四平街保卫战已接近四个星期，由于我守城部队的英勇抗击，外线部队的机巧运动，我军阵地仍屹立不动，现新一军已陷于进退两难的境地，除九日夜双方一度进行炮战，民主联军将国民党军比较突出之一二层高红屋阵地轰垮外，最近数日全线已呈胶着状态，虽有东北保安副司令长官郑洞国亲自指挥新一军，驻双庙子（四平街南四十里）督战，然也无法改变这一形势。现进犯军给养困难，高粱米也难得到，每日仅发给士兵二十元，但无物可买，向老百姓大抢豆子充饥。八日在四平街东南前线，竟有一排长向民主联军守军说：“请你们不要打枪，我愿爬到你那里说说。”守军即慨然允许，那排长爬来问：“你们到底要守到那天？”民主联军战士回答：“守到你们停止进攻为止！”排长仍颓丧的爬回去了。民主联军士气旺盛，坚持在最前线的指战员写信给东北民主联军林彪总司令说：“四平街永远是我们的！”四平街秩序亦极安定，城门业已开放，居民可以自由通行，市场交易按时进行，四乡农民运进粮食菜蔬。辽西辽北民主联军前线指挥所，均派慰劳团携带大批物品，慰劳阵地战士。现新一军正在一面整编部队，下令尽量节省弹药，以备将来决战，同时加强对士兵的监视，另方面等待沈阳方面增援。
