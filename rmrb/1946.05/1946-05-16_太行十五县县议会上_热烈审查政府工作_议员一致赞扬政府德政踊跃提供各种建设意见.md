　　【Xinhua News Agency, Changzhi, 13th】Through bottom-up general elections, people's representatives from fifteen counties in the new and old liberated areas of Taihang are enthusiastically reviewing the government's work in county councils. At the Xing (tai) xi County Council, all councilors unanimously praised the achievements in production and construction over the past few years. The labor force organized in the county was 47% the year before last, which increased to 60% last year, increasing grain production by more than 59,000 shi. The number of women spinners in the county has increased from 3,000 to 30,700 in the past two years. One hundred and four cooperatives have been organized in the county, with a share capital of 9.64 million yuan and more than 11,000 members. 224 lazy people were reformed and 530 impoverished households were helped to turn themselves around, greatly improving the lives of the people throughout the county. On April 28, the Huguan County Council also enthusiastically praised the democratic government's unprecedented great achievements in organizing 30,000 disaster-stricken people in the county to engage in production for self-salvation and overcome natural disasters in 1943 and 1944. The 55 county councilors in She County were particularly satisfied with the government's conscientious implementation of rent and interest reduction over the years, which improved the people's lives. In 1942 alone, more than 7,000 tenant debtor households in the mass movement turned themselves around, and more than 1,000 hired workers increased their wages, eliminating 1,050 impoverished households, allowing the people of the county to free themselves from feudal shackles. The people of the county launched a large-scale production movement with unprecedented enthusiasm. Councilors in Pingshun County gave the highest evaluation to the democratic government's leadership in carrying out investigations and rent reduction throughout the county and reforming the county's village government. At the Wuzhi County Council, a border county in the Yubei Liberated Area, Party member Wang Dinghua praised the democratic government's correct policy of combining armed force and mass movement in the most excited tone, suppressing bandits and illegal guns, and helping the people of Wuzhi to turn themselves around, which is the dictatorship most supported by the people. In the enthusiastic review of government work, county councilors in various counties enthusiastically put forward construction suggestions: On April 29, the 81 county councilors in Lucheng put forward the guiding principles for the county's construction this year. In the new areas, it is necessary to continue to thoroughly implement the rent reduction decree and organize the masses to carry out large-scale production, so that everyone has enough to eat and wear. In the old areas, it is necessary to improve mutual assistance and improve technology to generally achieve "耕三余一" [Geng San Yu Yi - cultivate three and have one remaining - meaning 1/4 of the produce can be kept by the farmer]. All councilors in She County proposed that the government should actively set up coal stations to solve the problem of coal burning for the people of the county, prohibit mountain opening, and plant trees extensively to prevent floods. County councilors in Xing (tai) xi, Tangyin and other counties also proposed to strengthen universal education and improve mass culture. They were very satisfied with the government's policy of making education expenditure the largest expenditure in the county after the administrative office reduced burdens this year. They said, "We can no longer let our children and grandchildren become blind with their eyes open." In the county councils of Changzhi, Licheng, Jiqi, Piancheng, Xingtai, Ping (ding) dong, Xiangyuan and other counties, they more indignantly discussed the current domestic situation and unanimously passed a telegram to the whole country, opposing the Kuomintang fascist faction's crime of expanding the civil war, and calling on the people of the county to organize themselves to defend the fruits of the eight-year war of resistance and prepare for self-defense in order to smash the reactionary faction's evil conspiracy to undermine peace.
    Note: After the administrative office of the Taihang region issued instructions in early April, the general election movement in the entire Taihang region was carried out from top to bottom in the new and old liberated areas. The counties carried out publicity mobilization and citizen registration from top to bottom. After the free and anonymous enthusiastic elections by voters, councilors from each county were produced, and each county council was established. The councilors directly elected the speakers of the county councils and mayors of counties and cities who were supported by the people. Currently, each county is actively engaged in reviewing government work.
