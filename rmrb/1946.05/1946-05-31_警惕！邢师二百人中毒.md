　　Beware! Two Hundred Students of Xingtai Normal School Poisoned
    [Xingtai News] Students of Xingtai Normal School discovered that a pot of rice was particularly yellow during breakfast on May 17th. Everyone didn't pay attention and thought it was just yellow rice. As a result, sixty or seventy people who ate this pot of rice became ill. On the 18th, it still didn't attract attention, and consequently, two hundred people experienced poisoning symptoms. Those poisoned felt numbness and swelling throughout their bodies, dizziness and blurred vision, and were unable to move. After the school invited doctors for treatment, they were still unable to get out of bed by the 21st. This incident has aroused great resentment among the teachers and students of the whole school, and the students have automatically strengthened their guard.
