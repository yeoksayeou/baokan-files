　　British Troops Cling to Iranian Oil
    Have Not Yet Withdrawn from Bahrain Island
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] Tehran dispatch: The Iranian newspaper Ashta demands that the government send an investigation team to southern Iran to investigate whether British troops have actually withdrawn from the area. The newspaper also stated: British troops have not yet withdrawn from Bahrain Island (located in the Persian Gulf, a petroleum-producing area) in Iran. Why hasn't the Security Council raised any discussions about this action?
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] Cairo dispatch: Due to differences in opinion from the Egyptian authorities regarding the British side's plan, British-Egyptian negotiations have stalled. The British representatives have returned to Britain to consult with Foreign Secretary Bevin. It is understood that Egypt refuses to include in the British-Egyptian treaty a stipulation that "under the threat of war," "British troops may re-enter Egypt."

　　英军留恋伊朗石油
    迄今未自巴林岛撤退
    【新华社延安二十八日电】德黑兰讯：伊朗阿什塔报要求政府派调查团至伊朗南部，调查英军是否确已自该地撤退。该报又称：英军迄今未自伊朗的巴林岛撤退（位于波斯湾，系石油产地），这种行动，安理会为什么没有提出任何讨论呢？
    【新华社延安二十八日电】开罗讯：由于埃及当局对英方的计划发生异议、英埃谈判已陷停顿。英代表已返英，向外相贝文请示。据悉：埃及拒绝在英埃条约中，规定“在战争威胁下”，“英军得重新开入埃及”。
