　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng Dispatch】 The cultural and educational movement in the entire Taiyue region has rapidly developed along with the mass movement and production movement. According to statistics from 34 counties in the region: (1) Last winter, there were 6,397 winter schools with 463,563 students, more than double the number in 1944. Yangcheng alone increased from 496 schools to 1,019 schools, and the number of students increased from 25,647 to 73,502. (2) There were 5,699 primary schools in the region, more than double the number in 1944, with a total of 204,775 students, of which 441 were people's schools. Primary schools are generally divided into three types: one type is established in villages where the rent reduction and production movement is well developed, and the masses have an urgent need for cultural learning, often with labor heroes as the core. Such as Cao Guangliang's Yanjia坪 Primary School in Qinyuan, and Shi Zhenming's Songshan Primary School in Fushan. Their characteristic is that the masses manage themselves, there are no restrictions on gender or age, and learning is closely integrated with production. Another type is run by model teachers to adapt to the specific situation of rural areas and cooperate with the masses. For example, in Yangcheng Gulong Primary School, the teacher Wei Kecheng changed Gulong Primary School into a people-run complete primary school in order to solve the various difficulties for men and women in the village to go to school in other villages. The third type is in areas with sparse population and scattered residences, where teachers adapt to the needs of the masses and take turns teaching in various villages, such as Anze and Jishi, which are very common. (3) There are six middle schools in the region with 904 students, an increase of two schools and 500 students compared with 1944, and five normal schools. The learning method is that students raise questions, and everyone discusses and learns from each other. (4) There are 2,100 reading groups in the region, divided into two types: one type is based on mutual aid groups, and reading groups are established to read newspapers during production breaks. The other type is village cadre reading groups, where cadres read newspapers when they meet every day. Cultural and recreational activities are also very active in the region. There are 522 rural theater troupes, with 1,371 actors, and 2,190 Yangge teams, with 109,550 actors. The content of the performances is closely related to the central work, and the actors do not leave production. Yangcheng alone has 75 rural theater troupes.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 12th】 Luzhong's worker-peasant culture and education have achieved remarkable results. Among the 7,078 villages in the region (excluding border areas), there are 9,200 people's schools with approximately 230,000 students; more than 5,000 women's literacy classes with approximately 120,000 students; 2,080 newspaper reading groups with 15,200 people, and more than 9,000 blackboards. The Luzhong Dazhong Newspaper alone can receive more than 2,000 articles from workers and peasants every month. There are 3,600 primary schools with more than 139,000 children attending school. In Youjia庄, Linyi, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were 490 illiterate men and women in the village, accounting for 96% of the total population. Now, 97 people in the village can write letters and keep accounts, 59 boys and girls have entered primary school, and those who are literate account for 47% of the village's population.

　　太岳群众翻身后
    大众文化广泛发展
    鲁中区成立民校九千余处
    【新华社阳城讯】太岳全区文教运动，随群运与生产运动而迅速开展，据全区三十四县的统计：（一）去年冬学六三九七座，学员四六三五六三人，较四四年增加一倍多。仅阳城即由四九六座增加到一○一九座，学员由二五六四七人增加到七三五○二人。（二）全区小学五六九九座较四四年增加一倍，共有学生二○四七七五人，其中有民办四四一座。小学一般分三种类型：一种是在减租生产运动开展好的村，群众有文化学习的要求迫切，多以劳动英雄为核心设立的。如沁源曹光亮的燕家坪小学，浮山石振明的松山小学等。其特点是群众自己管理，不限制性别和年龄，学习与生产密切结合。一种是模范教员适应农村具体情况和配合群众办的，如阳城固隆小学，教员卫克成因解决本村男女去外村上学的种种困难，将固隆小学改为民办完小。第三种为人口稀少住地分散地区，教员适应群众需要轮流到各村教学，如安泽、冀氏等地皆很普遍。（三）全区中学六座学生九○四人，较四四年增二座，学生增加五百人，师范五座。其学习方法是学生提出问题，大家讨论互相学习。（四）全区有读报组二千一百个，分为两种：一种以互助组为单位，成立读报组，在生产休息时进行读报。一种为村干部读报组，每天干部开会时读报。全区文娱也极活跃，农村剧团五百二十二个，演员一三七一人，秧歌队二千一百九十队，演员一○九五五○人，出演的内容都是与中心工作密切配合，演员都不脱离生产。仅阳城即有农村剧团七十五个。
    【新华社莱阳十二日电】鲁中工农文化教育，获得显著成绩，全区七○七八（边沿区除外）村庄中，即有民校九千二百处，学员二十三万人左右；妇女识字班五千多处，学员约十二万人；读报组二千零八十组，人数一万五千二百，黑板报九千余所。仅鲁中大众报社，每月即能收到二千余篇工农的投稿。小学三千六百处，上学儿童有十三万九千多人。临沂尤家庄，在抗战前全庄男女文盲有四百九十人，占总人口百分之九十六，现在全庄能写信记账的有九十七人，已入小学的男女儿童五十九人，识字的占全庄人口百分之四十七。
