　　Telegram from People of All Circles in Jin-Sui
    Protesting the Kuomintang's Conspiracy to Flood Ji-Lu
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 15th] The news that the Kuomintang authorities are rushing to repair the Garden Mouth Yellow River breach blocking project, attempting to flood the people of Ji-Lu, has greatly shocked people from all walks of life here. Labor, peasant, youth, women, and cultural organizations in the border region have jointly sent a telegram to the whole country, calling for a stop to this. It roughly states: To block the breach without first restoring the dikes of the Yellow River is not only a violation of the Heze Agreement, but also directly endangers the lives and property of millions of people in Ji, Lu, and Yu. If there were no other ulterior motives, how could it be so absurd? We wish our compatriots across the country to unite and stop this heinous crime of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and urge the Yellow River Commission to abide by political credibility, value the lives of the people, abide by the Heze Agreement, complete the dike repairs before releasing water, and promptly provide the local masses with material and financial assistance, so that dike repairs, river dredging, and other projects can be completed as soon as possible.
