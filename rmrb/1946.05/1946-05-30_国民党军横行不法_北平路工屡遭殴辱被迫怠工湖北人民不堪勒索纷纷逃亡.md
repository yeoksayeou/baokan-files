　　Kuomintang Army Runs Rampant and Lawlessly
    Railway Workers in Beiping Repeatedly Beaten and Insulted, Forced to Go on Strike; People of Hubei Cannot Bear Extortion and Flee in Droves
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th Dispatch] Beiping Dispatch: Recently, incidents of Kuomintang soldiers shooting and beating railway personnel have been occurring constantly here. On the 6th of this month, Guo Langtao, a Kuomintang Air Force lieutenant, escorted several military vehicles to Fengtai Station. Heading to areas such as Nanyuan and Huancheng, the station, according to the transport plan, ordered his vehicles to be attached to two trains. Guo refused to re-arrange the vehicles, cursed loudly, and opened fire, immediately wounding Xu Renting, a signalman at the station, in the legs and feet. The station staff all felt indignant and elected representatives to submit demands to the authorities for severe punishment of the perpetrators and medical treatment for the injured. The authorities ignored them. The entire station staff, unable to endure it any longer, went on strike on the 14th, causing temporary stoppages on the Beining and Pinghan lines. Following the Fengtai incident, on the 21st, another incident of Kuomintang soldiers beating railway workers occurred at Beiping East Station. At the beginning of this month, Gao Guanglu, the deputy stationmaster of the West Station, was also brutally beaten by soldiers. Railway employees and citizens throughout the city are all indignant at the lawless behavior of the Kuomintang army.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th Dispatch] Hankou Dispatch: In the dozen or so counties in northern Hubei, such as Zizhong and Guanghua, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are as numerous as hairs on an ox. These include landing fees, head taxes, paper and pen levies, bench and table levies, wealthy household levies, vehicle and horse levies, as well as other various labor service burdens. In areas where troops are stationed, such as Yingcheng County, the people must provide 10 million yuan in "horse fodder fees" each month. In Zizhong County, the grooms of stationed troops stole and sold horse fodder, and even let the horses into wheat fields to eat the wheat that had already formed kernels. The stationed troops in Zaoshi, Yingcheng, also enjoy the right to purchase goods at "military prices." Pork costs 600 yuan per catty on the market, but they only pay 300 yuan, leading to a butchers' strike. Currently, the people in this area are fleeing to the "lake region" (fleeing to the lake area near Jiangling). In Yangjiaji, Jingmen, of the 560 households originally in the township along the public road, as many as 167 households have fled to the lake region, with over 800 people, old and young. Only three-tenths of the land is being cultivated.

　　国民党军横行不法
    北平路工屡遭殴辱被迫怠工湖北人民不堪勒索纷纷逃亡
    【新华社延安二十六日电】北平讯：此间近来不断发生国民党军人枪击与殴打铁路人员事件。本月六日，有国民党空军少尉郭浪涛，押军用车数辆到丰台车站，分赴南苑、环城等地，站方按转运计划，令其车辆分挂两列车上，郭某竟悍然不允重新编车，破口大骂，并开枪射击，当场击伤该站信号司事许人庭的腿部及足部，该站员工咸抱不平，乃推派代表向当局提出严惩凶手、医疗伤者等项要求，当局不理，全站员工忍无可忍，遂于十四日全体怠工，致北宁、平汉两路一度停车。丰台事件后，二十一日，北平东站又发生国民党军殴打路员事件。本月初旬，西站副站长高广录亦被军人凶殴。铁路员工及全市市民，对国民党军之无法无天行为，莫不愤慨。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】汉口讯：鄂北自忠、光化等十数县，苛杂多如牛毛，如落地捐、人头税、纸笔捐、板凳桌椅捐、殷实捐、车马捐、以及其他各种劳役负担，凡有驻军的地方，如应城县每月人民还要出马干费一千万元。自忠县驻军，马夫偷卖了马干，还放马到麦田里去吃已经结粒的麦子。应城皂市的驻军，还享有以“军价”购物的权利，猪肉一斤市价六百元，他们只出三百元，以致屠户罢市。目前该地区人民纷纷“逃湖”（逃到江陵一带湖地）。荆门杨家集一地，该乡沿公路线原有五百六十户，现逃湖者，竟达一百六十七户，老小人口，在八百名以上，耕种田地者，只达十分之三。
