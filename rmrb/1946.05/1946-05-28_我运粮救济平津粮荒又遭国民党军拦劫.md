　　【Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 21st】 The Jizhong Administrative Office, adhering to the agreement reached on April 11th in Beiping to resolve the famine in Tianjin and Beiping, has already shipped 1.5 million shi of wheat and rice to the two cities. Although it is currently the busy spring season, the democratic government, in order to resolve the urgent needs of the people in Tianjin and Beiping, is still using large carts for transport, even though the rivers are too shallow for boats. However, the Kuomintang army is acting recklessly to obstruct this, and near Xinle and Changshou, in late last month, they robbed more than 20 carts of grain that the Jizhong democratic government was preparing to transport. They beat to death one village cadre, arrested two village cadres, and more than 40 members of the masses. They also dispatched secret agents to monitor and inspect the grain transport representatives and grain transport vehicles.

　　我运粮救济平津粮荒又遭国民党军拦劫
    【新华社河间二十一日电】冀中行署恪守四月十一日在北平成立的解救平津粮荒协议，已向平津两地运出麦米达一百五十万石。目前虽值春忙，但民主政府为解决平津两地人民生活急需，虽河浅不能行船，仍以大车运送。而国民党军反横行阻扰，在新乐、长寿附近，于上月下旬，将冀中民主政府准备运送之粮食二十余车抢去。打死村干部一人，捕去村干部二人，及群众四十余人。并派特务监视与检查运粮代表及运粮车辆。
