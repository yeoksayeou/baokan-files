　　【New China News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 21st dispatch】The Kuomintang army's large-scale offensive against the Central Hebei Liberated Area, along with its crimes of invading Pingbei and Eastern Hebei and expanding the civil war in various locations, has aroused widespread indignation among peace-loving people of all strata in Zhangjiakou, creating a mass anti-civil war movement. Representatives of more than 10,000 businesses from fifty trade associations citywide recently issued an urgent appeal to all sectors of the country, demanding that they urgently stop the reactionary faction's disastrous and harmful behavior. Since the Small Business Association launched the anti-civil war signature campaign, more than 12,000 people have signed, including hundreds of vendors from Beijing and Tianjin, declaring three propositions: (1) Immediately stop the Kuomintang army's breach of contract offensives and illegal troop movements, withdraw from all towns and cities occupied in the Liberated Areas, and return to their original defenses. (2) Quickly resolve the Northeast issue through peaceful political consultation, to avoid the continued expansion of the civil war. (3) Protect the Three Major Agreements and promptly realize Chiang Kai-shek's four promises. At the same time, workers from more than ten factories, including Minsheng Electric Company, Zhangyuan Tobacco Company, and Guangda Oil Factory, also held emergency meetings and jointly issued similar telegrams.
