　　Iranian Internal Negotiations Stalled
    Azerbaijan Premier Returns to Tabriz
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th] Tehran Dispatch: Under the obstruction of Iranian reactionaries, negotiations between the Iranian government and the Azerbaijan autonomous government have been declared stalled. It is reported that Azerbaijan Premier Pishvari has returned to Tabriz with his delegation. When Iranian Premier Sultani announced the deadlock in negotiations on Tehran Radio on the 13th, he stated, "Further discussions will be held in the future." It is reported that Iranian reactionaries constantly exerted pressure on Premier Sultani throughout the negotiations. The reactionaries believe that they have an opportunity after the Soviet withdrawal, and therefore, on one hand, deployed heavy troops on the Azerbaijan border to carry out provocations, and on the other hand, demanded that Sultani force Pishvari to submit. The reactionaries insisted that the governor of Azerbaijan Province should be appointed by the central government, that the army and gendarmerie should be commanded by the central government, that land reform should be cancelled, that land should be returned to landlords, and threatened Sultani. Tabriz Radio, in its recent broadcasts, severely condemned the Iranian reactionaries for being responsible for the failure of the negotiations. The broadcast declared that the freedom obtained by the people of Azerbaijan through decades of struggle cannot be taken away. It also declared that the Azerbaijan army has been ordered to resolutely resist the attacks of the reactionary army.

　　伊朗内政谈判停顿
    阿塞拜疆总理返大不里士
    【新华社延安十四日电】德黑兰讯：在伊朗反动派阻挠之下，伊朗政府与阿塞拜疆自治政府之间的谈判，已宣告停顿。据悉：阿塞拜疆总理皮希瓦利已偕其代表团返大不里士。伊总理十三日在德黑兰电台宣布谈判陷入僵局时称：“日后当再继续商谈”。据悉：伊反动派在整个谈判期间，不断向总理苏尔丹尼施行压力，反动派认为苏军撤退后有机可乘，因此一面陈布重兵于阿塞拜疆边境，实行挑衅，另方面要求苏尔丹尼压迫皮希瓦利就范。反动派坚持阿塞拜疆省长应由中央政府委任，军队与宪兵由中央统率，取消土地改革，土地归还地主，并威胁苏尔丹尼。大不里士电台于近日的广播中，严斥伊朗反动派应对谈判的失败负责。广播宣称：阿塞拜疆人民由于数十年来的斗争而获得的自由，是不能被剥夺的。并宣称：阿塞拜疆军队已奉命对反动派军队的进攻，给以坚决抵抗。
