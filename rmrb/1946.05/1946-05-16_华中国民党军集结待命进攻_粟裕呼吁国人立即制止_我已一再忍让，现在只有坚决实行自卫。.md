　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】 Su Yu, Deputy Commander of the Central China Military Region, recently made a statement to a reporter from this agency here. Deputy Commander Su first pointed out that the Central China Liberated Area is currently on the eve of a large-scale offensive by the Nationalist army. After the ceasefire order of January 13th took effect, the Nationalist army successively occupied Baipu Town in Rugao, northern Jiangsu; Zhao Zhuang, Xi Ma Chang, Yanfang, Yangjiaqiao, Si Ma Town, and Daqiao Town in Taixian County; Sanhe Town, Tianbu Town, and Changle Town in Tonghai (Nantong-Haimen); Lingdian Town in Qidong and other places; Maodunzi, Chengqiao, Hengliangdian, and Donggou Town in Liuhe, northern Huainan; Leiguanji in Lai'an County; Chenjiagou and other places in Ganquan (newly established county seat); Tuoheji in Lingbi, northern Huai; Hao City in Wuhe County; Sanpuji in Sudong; Licanji, Zhanglou, Duanlou, Qianhou Ranfang, and Pengji in Xia County, and occupied Xiao County city and other places. Even after the Huaiyin Executive Group arrived in Central China for over a month, and after the No. 6 order explicitly ordering the restoration to the situation at 12:00 on January 13th had been issued for over half a month, they still blatantly occupied Xiaohai Town, Xingren Town, and Chenjiaqiao in Nantong, northern Jiangsu, and Dashengqiao and other places in Taixing. Furthermore, sneak attacks and harassment of the people are a daily occurrence. Wherever the Nationalist army goes, it burns, kills, rapes, and loots. Even Mr. Xu Haoquan, who reported the truth about Baipu to the Executive Group, and Mr. Sun Pingtian and Mr. Qian Sufan, who welcomed the Executive Group in Nantong, were brutally murdered by special agents. Now, the Nationalist reactionaries are still attempting to launch a nationwide civil war. Along the Yangtze River in Central China, the 49th Army in the Tong (Nantong) Hai (Haimen) Jing (Jiangyin) area, the 100th Army in the Liang Tai (Taizhou, Taixing) area, the 25th Army on the Yangzhou-Yizheng-Xiannvmiao line, the 74th Army on the Liuhe-Dongge line, the 21st Army in the Chongming-Nantong area, the 9th Army along the Jinpu Railway line in Pukou, Chuxian, Bengbu, and the 58th Army south of Suxian-Xuzhou, as well as the 98th and 28th Armies in Xuzhou-Haimen, are all awaiting orders to move out. Deputy Commander Su continued: The situation in the Central China Liberated Area is extremely serious now. The guns and cannons of the Nationalist army have been lined up, and at a single command, they will bombard us. We have done everything humanly possible. If we continue to yield, the only result will be to encourage the greed of the reactionaries. Now we can only endure the pain and implement self-defense. Only under the condition of resolutely implementing self-defense, and only after the offensive of the reactionaries is stopped, will the lives and property and the peaceful and democratic life of the 23 million people in the Central China Liberated Area be guaranteed. After the ceasefire, we have carried out peaceful construction in various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture. We have further promoted democracy, launched a strict and just movement to punish traitors, promoted rent and interest reduction, and provided disaster relief for the spring famine, repaired canal embankments, and built highways. Restoring transportation and other peaceful construction work will inevitably be hindered by the offensive of the Nationalist reactionaries. However, we must call on everyone to continue these construction efforts diligently, and not interrupt them because of the unreasonable provocations of the Nationalist reactionaries. Finally, Deputy Commander Su appealed to the people of the whole country, to all peace-loving and democratic people in the Nationalist Party, in the Nationalist army, calling on them to immediately oppose the civil war and stop the civil war.

　　华中国民党军集结待命进攻
    粟裕呼吁国人立即制止
    我已一再忍让，现在只有坚决实行自卫。
    【新华社延安十二日电】华中军区粟副司令裕顷在此间对本社记者发表谈话，粟副司令首先指出，目前华中解放区正处于国民党军大规模进攻的前夜。国民党军在一月十三日停战令生效后，先后侵占我苏中如皋之白蒲镇，泰县之赵庄、西马厂、沿坊、杨家桥、嘶马镇、大桥镇，通（南通）海（门）之三和镇、天补镇、长乐镇，启东之灵甸镇等地；淮南六合之毛墩子、程桥、横梁甸、东沟镇，来安之雷官集、甘泉（新设县治）之陈家沟等地；淮北灵壁之沱河集，五河之濠城，宿东之三铺集，夏邑之李璨集、张楼、段楼、前后染房、彭集，并攻占萧县城等地。甚至在淮阴执行小组到达华中已逾一月，明令恢复一月十三日十二小时原状的和字第六号命令发出已逾半月的时候，还公然侵占我苏中南通之小海镇、兴仁镇、陈家桥，泰兴之大生桥等地。随后又侵占靖江之新港。至于偷袭民出扰，更无日无之。国民党军足迹所至，辄烧杀淫掠，甚至去执行小组报告白蒲实情的徐浩泉先生及南通欢迎执行小组的孙平天、钱素凡等先生，都遭了特务惨杀。现在国民党反动派还在企图发动全国性的内战，我华中沿江一带，通（南通）海（门）靖（江）地区的四十九军，两泰（泰州、泰兴）地区的一百军，扬州、仪征。仙女庙一线的廿五军，六合东葛一线的七十四军，崇明南通地区的二十一军，津浦沿线浦口、滁县蚌、埠一线的第九军，宿县徐州以南的五十八军，以及徐州海门的九十八军、二十八军，都已待命出动。粟副司令继称：现在华中解放区形势异常严重，国民党军的枪炮已经排好，一声号令，就会向我们轰击。我们已经做到仁至义尽的地步，如果我们再忍让，其结果只有促成反动派的贪欲。现在我们只有忍痛实行自卫，只有在坚决实行自卫的条件下，在反动派的进攻遭到阻止后，我华中解放区二千三百里的人民的生命财产与和平民主的生活才有保证。我们在停战以后，已进行政治、经济、文化等各方面的和平建设，我们更进一步的推行了民主，掀起了严正的惩奸运动，推行了减租减息，还救了春荒、修造运河堤岸、修筑公路。恢复交通等等，这一切和平建设的工作势必会因国民党反动派的进攻而受到阻挠。但是，我们要号召大家，这些建设工作仍然应该努力继续下去，不要因为国民党反动派无理挑衅而中断。最后，粟副司令向全国人民呼吁，向全国及国民党内、国民党军队内一切爱好和平民主的人士呼吁，要求他们立即反对内战，制止内战。
