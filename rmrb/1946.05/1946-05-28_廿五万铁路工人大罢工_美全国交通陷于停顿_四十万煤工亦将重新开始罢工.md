　　250,000 Railway Workers Strike
    US National Transportation Paralyzed
    400,000 Coal Miners to Resume Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] Washington dispatch: The 250,000 US railway workers, in what the New York Times calls "a massive domestic crisis," began a nationwide strike yesterday morning, disregarding government interference and orders to seize the railways. According to Reuters, "This strike not only paralyzes national transportation and creates a food shortage crisis, but will also cripple the entire industry and commerce." Only one day into the strike, serious consequences have already arisen in the United States. United Press International reported on the 24th: Coal production was greatly hampered today due to the railway strike. Because coal cars cannot be dispatched due to the railway strike, 90 percent of the bituminous coal industry will shut down by nightfall. After the railway strike began, President Truman immediately convened an emergency meeting of senior cabinet members on the 24th to discuss the crisis facing the United States due to the strike. Truman also ordered Eisenhower to shorten his stay in Georgia and return to Washington quickly to convene an emergency meeting, and requested the Senate and House of Representatives to convene a joint session on the 25th to hear the President's message on the current serious situation. At the same time, police in cities such as New York have been urgently dispatched to prevent any disturbances, while the government is desperately concentrating aircraft, trucks, and ships to prepare for emergencies.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] Washington dispatch: 400,000 US coal miners are scheduled to resume their major strike tomorrow. To prevent this serious threat, President Truman ordered the Department of the Interior to take over the coal mines on the 21st and called on workers to resume work quickly, but the striking workers resolutely refused and decided to strike on the scheduled date.

　　廿五万铁路工人大罢工
    美全国交通陷于停顿
    四十万煤工亦将重新开始罢工
    【新华社延安二十五日电】华盛顿讯：美纽约时报所称“浩大的国内危机”之美国二十五万铁路工人，不顾政府的干涉与对铁路的接收命令，已于昨日上午开始全国性的大罢工。据路透社称：“这次罢工，不仅使全国交通陷于停顿与造成粮食奇缺之危机，且将麻痹整个工商业”。罢工才一日，在美国内已产生了严重结果。合众社二十四日讯：煤炭生产，今日因铁道罢工而大受阻碍，由于铁道罢工不能派出煤车，因此烟煤工业百分之九十将于入暮时停工。铁路罢工开始后，杜鲁门总统即于二十四日召集内阁高级阁员紧急会议，讨论因罢工使美国所遭遇之危机。杜鲁门同时命令艾森豪威尔缩短其在乔治亚州的停期，速返华府，召开紧急会议，并要求参众两院于二十五日召开联席会议，以听取总统关于目前严重局势的咨文。同时，纽约等城市的警察，已紧急出动，以防止任何骚乱，政府则拚命集中飞机货车与船只，以备急需。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】华盛顿讯：美四十万煤矿工人，定明日重行开始大罢工。杜鲁门总统为防止此一严重威胁，已于二十一日下令内政部接管煤矿，并呼吁工人迅速复工，但罢工工人坚决拒绝，仍决于预定之日罢工。
