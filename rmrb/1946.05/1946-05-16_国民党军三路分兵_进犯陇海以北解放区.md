　　Kuomintang Army Divides into Three Routes
    Invading Liberated Areas North of the Longhai Railway
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 12th (Urgent Telegram)] News: The situation along the Longhai and Pinghan lines in the Jilu-Yu Region is becoming increasingly tense following the changes in the situation in our Sixth Sub-district (Yu East Region). On the Longhai front, the Kuomintang army, to coordinate its "encirclement and suppression" of our Yu East Liberated Area, has simultaneously deployed forces along the Xuzhou-Kaifeng section of the Longhai Railway, dividing them into three routes to attack our area north of the Longhai Railway. Each route's troops began assembling on the 8th. The first route consists of a portion of the 68th Army stationed in Kaifeng, in coordination with local security regiments such as those of Ding Shuben and Wang Sanzhu, advancing north from Tianfeng to Qiubei. This unit reached Fengqiu on the 10th. The second route consists of a portion of the 50th Army stationed in Shangqiu, attacking north from that county towards Shanxian. The third route is advancing north from Dangshan towards Peixian and Fengxian. Six regiments of unknown designation arrived by train from the east on the 9th and disembarked at Dangshan. On the 9th and 10th, Kuomintang troops arriving by train from the west were seen disembarking at the Neihuang and Yejiagang stations and stationed at the Sezhuang station. Troops of the 137th Division and 84th Division have also been observed arriving in Xuzhou. Jiang Jiabin's unit (Huaibei Advance Fourth Column), stationed between Dangshan and Yucheng, is building fortifications on the south bank of the Ji-Huang River, awaiting an opportunity to attack. On the Pinghan line, the Kuomintang army has ordered its units stationed southeast of Qixian at Qimen, north of Qixian at Dacizhuang and Haogou, and east of Anyang at Liuyuan, Cuijiaqiao, and Xindianji to construct fortifications by company, building a deep network of bunkers by platoon and company. One-third of their forces, in coordination with local armed forces, are responsible for defense, while two-thirds are gathered and deployed, awaiting an opportunity to attack. The 40th Army in Anyang also began conducting attack and defense training on May 1st. The designation of the Yu North Traffic Police was announced cancelled on the 5th, and its original subordinates, Cheng Daosheng, Guo Qing, and other local teams, are all under the command of the 40th Army. Li Ying's unit in Anyang is rumored to be moving to Taiyang, southeast of Anyang. The Anyang bus station has been moved from Xiguan to Dongguan. Based on this situation, the Kuomintang army on the Pinghan line is about to launch an eastward attack on our Jilu-Yu Fourth Sub-district, with extremely obvious intentions.

　　国民党军三路分兵
    进犯陇海以北解放区
    【新华社荷泽十二日急电】军息：冀鲁豫区陇海、平汉沿线形势，随我六分区（豫东区）的形势变化，亦已紧张万分。陇海方面，国民党军队为配合其向我豫东解放区之“围剿”，同时于陇海路徐州至开封段部署为三路向陇海路以北我区进攻，各路部队已于八日开始集结。第一路为驻开封之六十八军一部，配合丁树本、王三祝等地方保安团，田封邱北进，该部十日已至封邱；第二路为驻商邱之五十军一部，自该县北犯单县；第三路自砀山北犯沛县、丰县。九日由东运来番号不明之六个团，于砀山下车。九、十两日，内黄、野鸡岗车站均发现由西运来之国民党部队下车，驻于瑟庄车站。徐州亦发现增来一百三十七师、八十四师番号之部队。驻砀山虞城之间之蒋嘉宾部（淮北挺进第四纵队），在冀黄河南岸修筑碉堡，待机进攻。平汉线方面，国民党军命令其所属自淇县东南之淇门、淇县北之大赐庄、颢沟、安阳东之柳圆、崔家桥、辛店集等地以营为单位，构筑工事，以连排构筑纵深之碉堡群，其三分之一的兵力配合地方武装，负责守备，三分之二的兵力集结布置，待机进攻。安阳之四十军，亦于五月一日开始进行攻击与防守训练。豫北交通警察之番号，已于五日宣布取消，其原来所属程道生、郭清与其他地方团队，均归四十军指挥。安阳之李英部，有移至安阳东南太阳消息。安阳汽车站已由西关迁至东关。据此情况，平汉线之国民党军，即将东向进攻我冀鲁豫四分区，企图已极明显。
