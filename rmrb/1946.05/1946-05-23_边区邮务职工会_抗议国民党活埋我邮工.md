　　Border Region Postal Workers' Union
    Protests Kuomintang's Live Burial of Our Postal Workers
    [Our Newspaper Reported] The Preparatory Committee of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Postal Workers' General Union, in response to the Kuomintang reactionaries' live burial of postal workers in the Hua Zhong liberated area, has sent a telegram to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, all democratic parties nationwide, and postal workers nationwide, denouncing the reactionaries' brutal crimes. The telegram stated: Our comrades Wang Xiang and two others, postal workers from Xiaotong County, resolutely implemented the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and Order No. 4, to restore postal services, and were captured and buried alive by the heinous Kuomintang army's 338th Division. This union, representing 5,200 postal workers in the entire border region, firmly demands that the Kuomintang authorities implement the four promises, punish the main culprits, compensate the families of the postal workers who died in the line of duty, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. We also hope that all sectors of society nationwide will provide support and assistance.
