　　Comrade Lü Huisheng, Director of the Wanjiang Administrative Office
    Was Brutally Murdered by the Nanjing Authorities
    The Military and Civilians of East China are Overwhelmed with Grief and Indignation, Vowing to Avenge the Deceased
    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 13th] The fact that the Kuomintang fascist faction brutally murdered Comrade Lü Huisheng, Director of the Wanjiang Liberated Area Administrative Office, in the Jiangningzhen prison in Nanjing as early as last November has recently been confirmed. Upon hearing the grievous news, the military and civilians of the East China Liberated Area were overcome with grief and indignation. The 7th Division of the New Fourth Army held a memorial meeting in its garrison on the 1st of this month, with everyone vowing to avenge the deceased. Director Lü was a native of Wuwei, Anhui. He was 45 years old during the War of Resistance, a graduate of Peking University, and a well-known figure in the local education community. After the War of Resistance, he participated in the administrative work of the county, mobilizing the people to resist Japan, which was not tolerated by the authorities. In 1940, he resolutely went to work in the Liberated Area, serving successively as the county head of Yizheng in Huaibei, the principal of the Joint Middle School, and the county head of Wuwei and Director of the Administrative Office in Central Anhui. He devoted himself to public service for six years and was deeply loved by the masses. In 1942, he joined the Communist Party of China. In 1943, he personally supervised the construction of the Huai River dike on the north bank of the Yangtze River, completing a massive project that the Kuomintang government had failed to complete in the past twenty years. The people of the seven surrounding counties were forever freed from the scourge of floods. It was unanimously agreed to name the dike the "Huisheng Dike" to commemorate his contributions. Last June, when Director Lü withdrew north with the 7th Division of the New Fourth Army, he was suddenly attacked and arrested on the Yangtze River waterway by the 1st Regiment of the Anhui Provincial Security Corps of the Kuomintang (this unit was originally under the command of the traitor Hu Zhengkang, the former puppet county head of Wuwei). The Kuomintang fascist faction first used high positions and handsome salaries to shamelessly lure him, and then resorted to beatings and coercion, but Director Lü remained unyielding. In November, Hu sent Director Lü to Nanjing, where the Kuomintang authorities ordered his execution. Comrade Wang Huichuan, a staff officer of the Independent Brigade of the New Fourth Army, was also killed at the same time.

　　皖江行署主任吕惠生同志
    惨遭南京当局杀害
    华东军民悲愤万分誓为死者复仇
    【新华社临沂十三日电】国民党法西斯派早于去年十一月，将皖江解放区行政公署主任吕惠生同志惨杀于南京江宁镇狱中之事件，已于最近证实，恶耗传来，华东解放区军民，莫不悲愤万分。新四军七师，特于本月一日，在驻地举行追悼大会，全体誓为死者复仇。吕主任为安徽无为人，抗战时年四十五岁，北平大学毕业，为当地教育界名流，抗战后参加本县行政工作，动员人民抗战，为当局所不容。四○年毅然至解放区工作，历任淮南仪征县长、联合中学校长及皖中无为县长，行政公署主任。六年奋力从公，备受群众爱戴，四二年参加中国共产党，四三年曾亲自监修长江北岸之淮河堤岸，完成国党当政二十年来所不能完成的巨大工程，附近七县民众，永脱水患；公议将该堤命名为惠生堤，以志不忘。去年六月吕主任随新四军七师北撤，在长江水路上突遭国民党安徽省保安一团（该部原系伪无为县长胡逆正刚所属）袭击被捕，国民党法西斯派，先以高官厚禄，无耻相诱，后又施以毒打威逼，但吕主任坚不屈服，十一月间，胡逆将吕主任解往南京，国民党当局受命杀害，同时被难者尚有新四军独立旅参谋王惠川同志。
