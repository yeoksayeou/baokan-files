　　The Executive Yuan's "Self-Relief General Office" Makes a Fortune
    Henan Famine Victims Cry Out in Hunger
    Our Liberated Area People Have Contributed to the War of Resistance but Receive No Relief
    [Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo, 25th Dispatch] Although large quantities of UNRRA relief supplies have been transported to the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Henan, the famine victims are still crying out in hunger due to the heavy exploitation by the local Kuomintang reactionaries. The Kuomintang and puppet troops in Wuzhi and Xiuwu cities have been eating relief flour for half a month. Making a "relief fortune" has become another stroke of good luck for the Kuomintang reactionaries in the recovered areas. The local people all call the Executive Yuan Relief Administration the "Self-Relief General Office." UNRRA relief funds are in US dollars. The market rate is 2,500 法币 (Fa Bi) for every US dollar, but through the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, it becomes 2,000 法币. Article 10 of the Henan Relief Administration's distribution method for old clothes even stipulates that "100 packages of old leather shoes will be sent to the Henan Provincial Government for distribution to provincial-level government employees." Only ten packages are distributed to each county out of 1,600 packages of old clothes, and most of those are received by wealthy households. As for the vast number of people in the liberated areas who have suffered disasters while persisting in the War of Resistance, no relief has been given to them to this day. Even the amount transported to the liberated areas is very small. The Henan Branch Relief Work Team, which arrived in Jiaozuo on April 18, did not bring any relief supplies. The doctors of Qinyang Public Hospital treat the people day and night, but they have only received one box of ordinary medicines so far; two boxes of the five boxes of ordinary medicines transported to Jiaozuo have been transported back. Mr. Fu Bi (an American) from UNRRA, when inspecting the distribution of relief supplies on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line a few days ago, felt disgusted by the corrupt behavior of the Kuomintang officials. Now, the people in both the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas all hope that UNRRA will send personnel to northern Henan to conduct on-the-spot investigations, so that the relief supplies will not be used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to make relief fortunes for use in the civil war. (Note: "UNRRA" is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and "Executive Yuan Relief Administration" is the 行政院救济总署 (Xíngzhèng Yuàn Jiùjì Zǒngshǔ).)

　　行政院“救己总署”大发财
    河南饥民嗷嗷待哺
    我解放区人民抗战有功救济无份
    【本报焦作二十五日电】联总救济物资虽已大批运到河南国民党统治区，但经过当地国民党反动派的重重剥削，饥民们尚在嗷嗷待哺。武陟修武城内的国民党军与伪军，半月前即吃的是救济面，发“救济财”成为收复区内国民党反动派又一红运。当地人民均呼行政院救济总署为“救己总署”。联总救济款为美元，市场每元美金换法币二千五百元，经过行总却变成换二千元。河南救济分署旧衣发放办法第十条竟规定“旧皮鞋一百包送由河南省政府分配省级各机关职员”，旧衣一千六百包，每县仅分得十包，而所分得的多系富户。至于对于解放区坚持抗战而遭受灾难的广大人民，则至今未予救济。即有运至解放区者，亦为数甚微。四月十八日到焦作的河南分署救济工作队，未带来任何救济物资。沁阳公立医院医生昼夜为人民诊治，但至今只分得普通药品一箱；运来焦作之五箱普通药品，又被运回两箱。日前联总甫毕先生（美人）在津浦线考查救济物资分配情形时，曾对国民党官僚们贪污行为，感到厌恶。现在不论国民党统治区或解放区的人民，无不希望联总派员到豫北实地考查。不使救济物资，作为国民党反动派发救济财进行内战之用。（按：“联总”是联合国救济总署，“行总”是行政院救济总署）
