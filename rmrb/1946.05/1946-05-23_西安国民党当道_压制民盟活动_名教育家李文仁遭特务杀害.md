　　Xi'an Kuomintang Authorities in Power
    Suppress China Democratic League Activities
    Renowned Educator Li Wenren Assassinated by Secret Agents
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] Xi'an News: On April 30th, Mr. Li Wenren, editor of the Minzhong Daobao and a renowned educator, who was assassinated by secret agents, succumbed to his injuries and passed away on the 3rd of this month at his residence in Xianyang. It is widely rumored here that the tragic assassinations of Li Wenren and Wang Ren, a famous lawyer and legal advisor to the Qinfeng Industrial and Commercial Daily, were not only due to their usual advocacy for peace and democracy but also because they joined the China Democratic League, which aroused the jealousy of the Kuomintang authorities. It is heard that the Kuomintang authorities in Xi'an have now issued an order to prohibit the China Democratic League from operating in Shaanxi and have included several democratic figures, whom they consider to be members of the China Democratic League, on an assassination blacklist.

　　西安国民党当道
    压制民盟活动
    名教育家李文仁遭特务杀害
    【新华社延安十八日电】西安讯：四月三十日，横遭特务暗杀的民众导报主编名教育家李文仁氏，因伤重不治，已于本月三日在咸阳寓所逝世。前日此间盛传李文仁与秦风工商日报法律顾问名律师王仁两氏之惨遭暗害，不仅由于他们平日主张和平民主，且因他们加入民主同盟，致遭国民党当局嫉忌。闻西安国民党当局现已下令禁止民主同盟在陕活动，并将若干被他们认为是民主同盟盟员的民主人士，列入暗杀黑名单中。
