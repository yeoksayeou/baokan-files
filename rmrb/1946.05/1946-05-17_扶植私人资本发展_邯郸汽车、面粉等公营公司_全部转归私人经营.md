　　Support the Development of Private Capital
    Handan Automobile, Flour, and Other Public Companies
    All Transferred to Private Management
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu General Branch News] In order to support the development of private capital, the democratic government here has decided to transfer the Handan Municipal Flour Company, Oil Pressing Factory, and publicly-owned Alcohol Factory, Iron Factory, and Automobile Company, originally managed by the government, to private operation. Currently, the Automobile Company has been taken over by Mr. Yao Shiji and others for 7 million Jichaobi (冀钞币), and renamed Hengli Automobile Company. The Alcohol Factory was taken over by Yang Hongxingtang (杨宏兴堂), Hu Fuyuantang (胡福源堂), and Yang Yongqingtang (杨永庆堂) for 5 million Jichaobi, and renamed Yihecheng Alcohol Factory. Dahua Flour Company is also in the process of clearing assets, registering old shareholders, and recruiting shareholders for reorganization. This flour company, formerly Yifeng Company, was founded in 1924. It has now developed to have three boilers and a 75-horsepower engine. Before the incident (likely referring to the Japanese invasion), its capital was 200,000 yuan, with over 100 shareholders. It had a considerable and stable market in Shijiazhuang and Beiping. However, since the Japanese occupation, it was placed under military management and renamed Nitto Company, affiliated with Nitto Seifun Co., Ltd., and all capital and profits were seized by the Japanese invaders. After the Japanese surrendered and our army liberated Handan, the current government, in order to take care of the interests of the old shareholders of the company, has decided to return the original machinery, real estate, and land to the original shareholders. The property added by the enemy will also be transferred to private individuals at a low price. The specific methods are: 1. Clear the assets, and price the machinery, houses, land, and goods one by one. The part belonging to the old shareholders will be distributed according to their shareholding amount at the current market price. The total capital in the past was 200,000 yuan. If the current value of this property is 4 million yuan, then the original 10,000 yuan shareholding will now be 200,000 yuan. 2. Notify all shareholders to come for registration. Except for those who have been found to have collaborated with the enemy and whose property should be confiscated according to law, all stocks are valid. In order to take care of shareholders scattered in places such as Tianjin and Beiping, a relatively ample registration time is stipulated. 3. Recruit new shares and reorganize into a new company.
    The Automobile Company and the Alcohol Factory were both established in Handan after liberation, from scratch and from small to large. Technicians and workers worked hard to unload parts from many damaged cars and refit them into new cars, and now there are eight of them. In order to use alcohol to replace gasoline, they also repaired a broken old distillery, added some machines, and started making alcohol.
    After privatization, they can freely set prices for tickets and freely sell wine and alcohol. Except for paying a business tax of less than 20% of net profit, they are not subject to any government restrictions.
    [Another News] In order to support the development of the private economy, the General Administration of Industry and Commerce has transferred the Taihang No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 Cigarette Factories to private operation for more than 86 million yuan, and renamed them Daxing Tobacco Company. The fixed amount of capital is 200 million yuan, and share capital is currently being raised. The collected shares have reached 120.007 million yuan. Zhou Yuteng was elected as the chairman of the board, and Song Mingsan, Wang Lining, Zhang Yuan, and Li Guangjun were elected as directors. A shareholders' meeting is scheduled to be held on May 22.

　　扶植私人资本发展
    邯郸汽车、面粉等公营公司
    全部转归私人经营
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】为扶持私人资本之发展，此间民主政府决定将邯郸市原由政府管理之面粉公司、榨油厂，公营的酒精厂、铁工厂、汽车公司转让给私人经营。现汽车公司已由姚石吉先生等以七百万冀钞接收，改为恒利汽车公司。酒精厂由杨宏兴堂、胡福源堂、杨永庆堂以五百万冀钞接收，改为义和成酒精厂。大华面粉公司也正在清理财产，登记旧股东，召股改组。该面粉公司，即前怡丰公司，为民国十三年创办，现已发展到有三口锅炉，七十五匹马力的引擎，事变前，资本二十万元，股东一百余人，每日可出面三万斤，在石家庄和北平占有相当固定的市场，但自日寇占领即施行军事管理，改为日东公司，隶属于日东制粉株式会社，所有资本与利润全部为日寇所侵夺。日本投降后我军解放邯郸，现政府为照顾该公司旧股东利益，已决定将原有的机器、房产、地产、退还原股东。敌人添置的财产也廉价转让给私人。具体的办法是：一、清理财产，将机器、房屋、地皮、货物一一作价，属于旧股东的部分，以现在市价，按其股票金额分配之，过去总资金为二十万，如现在此项财产值四百万，则过去一万元之股金，现在则为二十万元。二、通知各股东前来登记，审查股票除通敌有据，其财产依法应予没收者外，一律有效。并为照顾散居平津等地之股东，规定了比较充裕的登记时间。三、召募新股，改组为新的公司。
    汽车公司与酒精厂都是在邯郸解放后，从无到有，从小到大地建立起来的。技师们和工人们艰苦地从许多毁坏了的汽车上卸下零件，改装成新的汽车，现在已经八部了。为了用酒精代替汽油，又把一个坏了的旧烧锅加以修补，添了些机器，造起酒精来。
    私营之后，可自由定价售票，自由出卖酒与酒精，除缴纳低于纯利百分之二十的营业税外，不受政府任何限制。
    【又讯】工商管理总局为扶植私人经济发展，特将太行一、二、三、四、五、六烟厂以八千六百余万元转让给私人经营，改名为大兴烟草公司。资金定额二万万元，现正招募股金，集股已达一万万二千零零七万元。选出周钰滕为董事长，宋铭三、王立宁、张垣、李光军为董事，订于五月二十二日召开股东会议。
