　　*JiluYu Daily* Publishes Editorial
    Insist on Implementing the Heze River Management Agreement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 8th] The *JiluYu Daily* published an editorial on the 7th titled "Insist on Implementing the Heze River Diversion Agreement," stating: The issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course is a momentous event for the Border Region, concerning the lives and property of tens of millions of people. Therefore, millions of people in the Border Region are watching this issue with their eyes wide open. After the Heze River Management Agreement was established, millions of people in Chongqing could be spared from disaster. Unexpectedly, immediately after the survey team returned to Kaifeng, the Kuomintang authorities changed their minds again. On one hand, they used the Central News Agency to spread rumors, saying: "The work of blocking the breach and releasing water will be completed within two months, and the consent of the Communist side has been obtained." On the other hand, they instigated the UNRRA to threaten the river management agency with the termination of all supplies, insisting that the breach-blocking project be completed within two months. From the above process, it is not difficult to understand what the Kuomintang authorities' intentions are regarding river management. Their proclaimed "river management and dredging" is actually blocking the breach and releasing water, creating floods; their so-called "promoting benefits and eliminating harm" is actually harming the people; their so-called "relieving the people" is actually taking the people's lives, wanting the lives and property of millions of compatriots north of the Longhai Railway to be swallowed by floods. The Central News Agency and all Kuomintang newspapers chorused: "The Chinese Communist side possesses abundant manpower and resources, and has a strict organization, sufficient to complete the embankment restoration and river management project simultaneously with the Huayuankou breach-blocking project within two months." What a huge conspiracy! During the river channel survey, Chairman Zhao of the Yellow River Commission and the engineers of the commission repeatedly expressed to us: "The project is too vast and cannot be completed in a short period of time. The Kuomintang authorities breached Zhongmu seven or eight years ago, causing unprecedented disasters to the people of Henan. Now, we should immediately provide relief to the disaster victims in Henan, and regard embankment restoration, river dredging, and relief to the people of Henan as equally important. The current situation is very dangerous, and all the comrades in the Border Region are now facing the threat of death, watching their wives, children, and elders being washed away by the Yellow River. The people of the Border Region cannot tolerate such evil actions by the reactionaries and will unite, regardless of rich or poor, male or female, young or old, to take necessary actions. We demand that the people of the whole country pay attention to this event and provide righteous assistance. We demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately stop the breach-blocking project, handle embankment restoration, river dredging, and relief matters, and faithfully implement the Heze Agreement. Otherwise, it will inevitably arouse the unstoppable anger of millions of people in the Border Region, and the Kuomintang authorities shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom."

　　冀鲁豫日报发表社论
    坚持实现荷泽治河协定
    【新华社荷泽八日电】冀鲁豫日报于七日以“坚持实行荷泽治河改道协定”为题，发表社论称：黄河改道归故问题，在边区说来，是一件天大的事件，是有关数千万人民生命财产的问题，所以边区千百万人民，都睁着眼睛注视着这一问题。荷泽治河协定成立后，数百万群众重庆可免于难。不料勘察甫回开封，国民党当局却又变卦了，他们一面经中央社广播造谣说：“两个月内要完成堵口放水，并已征得共方的同意”，一面唆使联总行总以断绝一切供给来威胁治河机关，一定要在两月完成堵口工程。从以上经过，也就不难明白国民党当局治河的企图是什么了。他们标榜的“治河开道”，原来就是堵口放水，制造洪水；他们所谓“兴利除害”，原来是祸害人民；他们所谓“救济人民”，原来是要人民的命，是要陇海路北千百万同胞的生命财产付诸洪水。中央社和国民党的一切报纸，都异口同声的说：“中共方面握有雄厚的人力物力，有严密的组织，足以能在两个月内把复堤治河工程配合花园口堵口工程同时完成。”这是多大的一个阴谋！在勘察河道时，黄委会赵委员长及该会诸工程师等，也一再向我们表示：“工程过于浩大，短期内绝不能完工，国民党当局在七八年前决口中牟，造成河南同胞空前的灾难，现在应立即救济河南灾胞，应将复堤浚河与救济河南同胞看成同等重要。目前的形势已非常危险，现在全边区的同胞已面临着死亡的威胁，眼看着自己的妻子老少将被黄水荡尽。边区人民是不能容忍反动派这样万恶的行为的，会不分贫富、不分男女老幼的团结起来，采取必要的行动。我们要求全国人民注意这一事件，给以正义的援助，我们要求国民党当局立即制止堵口工程，办理复堤浚河救济等事项，忠实实践荷泽协定，否则势必激起全边区千百万人民不可抑止的愤怒，因此而引起的一切后果，应由国民党当局负完全责任。
