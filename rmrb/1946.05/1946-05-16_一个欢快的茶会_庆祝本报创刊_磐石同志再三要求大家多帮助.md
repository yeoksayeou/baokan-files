　　【Special Report from This Newspaper】For the past half-month, the building at the east entrance of Huojie Street in Handan City has been frequently visited by friends. We – the workers of the People's Daily – have been happily and busily receiving our guests. "Can the newspaper be published on time!" "The fifteenth is coming soon!" This emotionally charged expectation and encouragement has turned into a force that urges us to actively prepare.

　　Craftsmen are sweating, rushing to sculpt the plaques for "People's Daily Office" and "Xinhua News Agency," with comrades from the Art Section of the Military Region Political Department personally participating and providing guidance. Soldiers, citizens, civil servants, and students often gather around the building to watch. Those busy writing upstairs see this enthusiastic scene, and a complex emotion of joy and gratitude wells up in their hearts. This public concern, the expectations of society, should be such a powerful encouragement for us young people!

　　Party, government, and military leaders, as well as comrades from the Third Bureau and other organs, inquire about the preparations almost every day, giving instructions on everything and resolving difficulties. Comrade Panshi often gently reminds us: "Don't let everyone's expectations down!"

　　The days are approaching, and it's already the fourteenth. From early morning, the typesetting room of the printing factory is fully mobilized, and editors and reporters run to the factory to proofread. The engraving workers are sweating profusely, meticulously carving the inscriptions of the leaders. No lunch, no nap. We work diligently for twelve hours. The Xinhua Bookstore has added many new customers, with 840 subscriptions placed on this day alone.

　　The printing factory's machines are running all night. At eight o'clock on the morning of the fifteenth, the newspaper was published. The post office's bicycles rush to the door of the newspaper office. When they learned that the newspaper was still at the factory, they immediately rushed to the factory again. Soon, the street's reading areas were crowded with people.

　　At ten o'clock, an inaugural tea party was held in the auditorium of Handan Middle School. Leaders, representatives of various organizations and groups, and the staff of this newspaper sat together, all with the same smiling faces. Commander Liu felt slightly unwell these days, but he was also very happy to come with Political Commissar Deng, examining the inaugural issue with double-lens glasses.

　　Comrade Panshi took advantage of this opportunity to "review the first issue of the newspaper," reporting on the preparations for this newspaper, the current situation, and the future plans. At the end of his report, he said: "The publication of the newspaper today is primarily due to the spiritual and material encouragement and help from all aspects," because "there are still many difficulties, and there may be inadequacies in taking care of all aspects. Please forgive us and hope for as much help as possible."

　　Chairman Yang Xiufeng, with a beaming smile, mentioned several times that he was "very happy." He said: The newspaper should publish more on region-wide major issues, such as the "Yellow River Returning to its Old Course" issue, which affects the lives of millions of people, and should be continuously and deeply disclosed. The first issue did this and "did it well." He believes that in the future, we should accelerate transmission and strengthen communication work to give greater effect to the newspaper.

　　Comrade Zhang Jichun first encouraged the comrades of the newspaper and news agency. He proposed that in the future, attention should be paid to "helping the leadership," "organizing struggles," and "exchanging experiences"; "relying on everyone's strength to make the newspaper more perfect."

　　Vice-Chairman Xing Zhaotang "sincerely congratulated" the publication of the newspaper and put forward many concrete suggestions, "publicize our democratic movement and basic policies more." Pay attention to using diverse forms of publicity and improving writing skills.

　　Comrades Ren Baige and Chen Feiqin also spoke. Comrade Ren Baige expressed gratitude for the publication of this spiritual food. Indeed, everyone needs it, and before the meeting and during the breaks in the speeches, wasn't everyone quietly reading it? But how can we make it even better? In addition to thanking everyone for taking the time to attend, Comrade Panshi finally reiterated "please provide opinions at any time in the future and provide more help."

　　一个欢快的茶会
    庆祝本报创刊
    磐石同志再三要求大家多帮助
    【本报特写】半个月来，邯郸市火街东口的大楼经常被朋友们所访问。我们——人民日报的工作者，愉快而忙碌的接待着自己的客人。“大报能按时出版吧！”“十五号快到了！”这种情感洋溢的期望与鼓励，变成督促我们积极筹备的力量。
    匠人们流着汗水，赶塑“人民日报馆”、“新华通讯社”的门额，军区政治部艺术科的同志们亲自参加指导。军人、市民、公务员、学生们经常围着大楼伫足而观。在楼上忙于编写的人们看到这种热烈的情形，心中泛起一种欢欣感激的复杂情绪。这群众的关心，社会的期望，对于我们这些青年人，该是多么有力的鼓舞呢！
    党政军首长及三局等机关的同志们几乎每天询问筹备的情况，指示一切，解决困难。磐石同志常常这么轻轻的提醒着：“不要辜负大家的期望啊！”
    日子一天天的逼近了，已经到了十四号。印刷厂排字房从清晨就全体动员，编辑记者们跑到工厂里当校对。刻字工人汗流满面，精雕首长的题词。午饭不吃，午觉不睡。一直忙碌了十二个钟头。新华书店新添了许多顾客，这一天订报的有八百四十份之多。
    印刷厂的机器通宵劫动着。十五日上午八点钟，报纸出版了。邮局的自行车跑到报馆的门前，他们知道了报纸还在工厂时，立刻又向工厂驰去。不久，街头的阅报处挤满了人。
    十点钟，在邯郸中学礼堂举行创刊典礼茶会。首长们、各机关团体的代表和本报的工作人员坐在一起，大家浮着一个相同的笑脸。刘司令员身体近日稍感不适，但也很高兴地和邓政委一起来了，用两重眼镜端详着创刊号。
    磐石同志乘着这个“检阅第一期报纸”的机会，把本报筹备的经过，现在的情况和将来的计划报告了一下，他在报告的结尾说：“报纸能在今天出版，首先要感谢各方面精神上、物质上的鼓励与帮助”，因为“现在仍有许多困难，对各方面可能有照顾不周的地方，请原谅。并希望尽可能多多帮助。”
    杨秀峰主席满面笑容，几次提到自己“很高兴”。他说：大报应该多多登载全区性的大问题，例如关系几百万人生命的“黄河归故”问题，就该连续、深刻的披露。第一期这样作了，“作得很好”。他认为今后应该加速传递，加强通讯工作，以发挥报纸更大的效果。
    张际春同志首先把报纸及通讯社的同志鼓励了一番。提出今后要注意“帮助领导”、“组织斗争”、“交流经验”；“依靠大家的力量，把报纸搞得更完善些”。
    邢肇棠副议长对报纸的出版，“竭诚祝贺”，并提出许多具体意见，“多宣传我们的民主运动和基本政策”。注意在宣传上，采用多种多样的形式，提高文字技术。
    任白戈、陈斐琴等同志都说了话。任白戈同志感谢这个精神食粮的出版。的确，大家都很需要它，在开会之前及讲话的间隙中，每个人不是都在静静的读着它吗？但是，怎样才能把它办得更好些呢？磐石同志最后除对大家拨冗莅会表示感谢外，又再三提出“请以后随时提示意见，多多帮助”。
