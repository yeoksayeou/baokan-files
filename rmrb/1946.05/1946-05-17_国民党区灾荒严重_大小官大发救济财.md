　　Kuomintang Areas Suffer Severe Famine
    Big and Small Officials Make a Fortune from Relief Funds
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] The famine in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is extremely severe. Not only is the authorities relying solely on the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for relief materials, but officials of all ranks are doing everything they can to steal and embezzle UNRRA relief supplies. It is said that Yueyang, Hunan, was allocated a batch of clothing, but failed to receive it according to the original quota. Even those who received it often found that it had been replaced with tattered Chinese clothing. (April 15th, *Xinwen Bao* "How to Relieve the Hunan Disaster") In Guangzhou, after a batch of relief clothing was transported in, it suddenly disappeared before it was scheduled to be distributed. In Henan, a large batch of Western suits were transported to Kaifeng. Just as the relief distribution office was preparing to distribute the Western suits to the refugees, someone suddenly suggested that it would be inappropriate for the refugees to wear foreign clothes; it would be better to convert them into Chinese clothes for distribution to the refugees. This suggestion was certainly excellent, but what was extremely un-excellent was that after these clothes were sold, there was no further news of the proceeds. In Guangzhou, a large batch of relief flour disappeared without a trace, losing several thousand bags. A large quantity of relief supplies was taken by those in power to repay debts and hoard for profit. In March, the Hunan Relief Distribution Office allocated over 90 million yuan in agricultural loans to various disaster areas. As soon as this loan reached the hands of the parties involved, it was withheld, either to be used as capital for them to lend out and collect interest, or to be used for bribing for official positions. These parties charged interest rates as high as 2,000 yuan per month per 10,000 yuan loaned, or loaned one *shi* of rice to be repaid with two *shi* in the autumn (*Xinwen Bao* "How to Relieve the Hunan Disaster"). Hu Zijian, the district head of the eighth district of Hengyang, in order to get elected as a municipal councilor, withheld 550,000 yuan in funds and more than ten large bags of relief clothing for his personal bribery (*Zhengyan Bao*, April 15th, "Incidents of Disaster Relief in Hunan Province"). What is particularly noteworthy is that on March 24th, Yu Hongjun, representing the Kuomintang government, made a financial report at the National Political Consultative Conference, in which he openly proposed that the utilization of general relief materials be listed as a "source of wealth" for "balancing revenue and expenditure," "stabilizing finance," and "enriching local finances."

　　国民党区灾荒严重
    大小官大发救济财
    【新华社延安十二日电】国民党统治区灾荒极端严重，当局不惟只靠联合国救济总署物资救济，且大小官员对联总救济物资，极尽盗窃侵吞之能事。湖南岳阳据说分得账衣一部，却未能依照原定配额领取，即使领得者，亦多是经过调换的破破烂烂的中国服装。（四月十五日，新闻报《如何救济湘灾》）在广州运到同批赈衣后，忽然在定期分发以前，不翼而飞了。在河南也有大批西装运汴，救济分署正预备将西服分发给难民时，忽然有人建议，给难民穿上洋衣服，那像啥事体，还不如把它改购中国衣服，分发给难民。这个建议固然极妙，但极不妙的却是把这些衣服一变卖之后，就再无音讯了。广州运到一批救济面粉，没头没脑就失掉了几千包。大批的救济物资，被有权者拿去抵债居奇。三月份湖南救济分署，向各灾区配发了九千余万元农贷，这笔农贷一到当事者手里，就被扣留下来，或作为他们放款收息的资本，或供他们贿选官职的费用，这些当事者贷起款来，月息每万元高达二千元，或贷稻一石，至秋天要还二石（新闻报《如何救济湘灾》）衡阳第八区区长胡子健，为了想当选市参议员，扣帐款五十五万元及赈衣十余大袋，作了私人贿选之用（四月十五日正言报《湘省赈灾拾闻》）。尤其值得世人注意的，就是三月廿四日俞鸿钧在国参会上，代表国民党政府所作的财政报告，他公开提出总救济物资的利用，列为“平衡收支”“稳定金融”和“充裕地方财政”的一个“财源”。
