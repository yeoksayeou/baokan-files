　　TASS Authorized to Refute Rumors: No German Officers in the Red Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd Dispatch] TASS is authorized to refute rumors. British Reuters and several London newspapers published news claiming that Russians have incorporated many former German officers into Red Army units, and that German officers are helping to train Red Army troops. TASS is authorized to declare that these are outright fabrications, the sole purpose of which is to make backward people disbelieve the fact that a large number of German troops are being preserved in the British-occupied zone of Germany. (Editor's note: According to American journalists, the formal German troops retained in that area amount to 120,000, while according to American columnist Stone's judgment, there are as many as one million German troops retained by the British). Secondly, the Red Army does not need the help of foreign officers at all, let alone the help of German officers.

　　塔斯社奉命辟谣红军中绝无德军官
    【新华社延安廿三日电】塔斯社奉命辟谣，英国路透社及伦敦几家报纸登载消息称：俄国人把许多前德国的军官编入红军部队中，并称德国军官正在帮助训练红军部队。塔斯社奉命声明，这些彻头彻尾都是凭空捏造的，唯一目的是企图使落后的人们不相信在德国英军占领区保存大量德军的事实。（编者按：据美国记者揭露，该区保留之正式德军达十二万人，而据美国专栏作家史东之判断，则有达百万之德军，由英国所保留）。其次红军根本不需要外国军官帮助，尤其是德国军官的帮助更说不上。
