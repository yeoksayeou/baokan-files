　　With Government and Original Owner Working Together
    Kejing Coal Mine Resumes Operations
    Workers Concerned About 30% Increase in Mine Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch News] The historically significant Ji Yuan Kejing Coal Mine, after the Anti-Japanese War, suffered repeated destruction by the enemy, puppets, and diehards, as well as natural disasters, resulting in a four-year work stoppage. Now, through the joint efforts of our democratic government and Mr. Zhai Le'an, the original owner of the mine, production has resumed, with a daily output of 800 tons of coal. According to investigations, the mine area spans over thirty li from east to west and five to eight li from north to south. The coal seams are shallowest at one zhang and deepest at eight zhang, with a common depth of three zhang. Since the mine was recovered by our army last year, the old mine was badly damaged, and the machinery was incomplete. For the benefit of the people and to support the development of private enterprises, our democratic government consulted with Mr. Zhai Le'an, the original owner of the mine, in late November last year to discuss ways to resume work. The Economic Bureau also provided 20 million yuan in cash as a fund to support the mine. Technical workers were recruited at high prices from various places, and with the assistance of local masses, after a month and a half of repairing the tunnels and overhauling the machinery, work finally resumed in February of this year. Regarding labor-capital relations, the past system of high exploitation and abuse of workers by the capitalists has been improved. Now, under the leadership of our democratic government, everything is handled in a democratic manner. First, it was determined that workers have the responsibility to participate in the management of the factory and care for the mine, and at the same time, they also have the right to discuss various workers' wages and various systems. The capitalist has the obligation to solve various difficulties of the workers. The determination of wages and grain prices must be effective only after the workers' group or the general meeting agrees. Dismissal of workers must be approved by the trade union. Currently, the mine has a total of 1,214 workers, with mine workers accounting for 60%, machinists accounting for 10%, general workers accounting for 15%, foremen accounting for 10%, and staff accounting for 5%. The highest daily wage for workers is 200 yuan (equivalent to 1.6 dou of millet), the lowest is 60 yuan, and the average general wage is 140 yuan. In addition to their own expenses of 50 yuan per day, they can support five to seven people. In addition to salary, workers' families are also subsidized with coal for burning, ranging from 200 to 250 jin per person per month. If coal is not needed, it can be discounted at a price of three mao per jin. All of the above are proposed by the factory through democratic means and then determined after discussion by the workers. Due to the improvement of labor-capital relations and the increase in workers' living standards, workers are not only concerned about the future of the mine and the cost and sales of coal, but also vigilant about the sabotage of special agents and bad people. The production volume has increased by 30% compared to the past. They also voluntarily proposed to reduce the distribution of half an ounce of oil per person per day, saving the entire mine 35 jin of oil per day. The mine originally produced 500 to 600 tons of coal per day, but now it has increased to more than 800 tons (more than 1.1 million jin). In order to encourage workers to actively produce, the factory stipulated reward measures: those who produce one more cage of coal per day will be awarded 40 yuan, those who produce more than ten cages will be awarded 50 yuan per cage, and those who produce more than twenty cages will be awarded 60 yuan per cage. Therefore, all the mine workers have launched a production competition, and each can produce about fifteen to twenty more cages per day.

　　政府与原主协力下
    磕井煤矿复业
    工人关心矿窑增产百分之卅
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】富有历史意义的济源磕井煤矿，抗战后，经敌伪顽的一再破坏与灾荒，停工已达四年之久，现经我民主政府与该矿原主翟乐安先生之共同努力，已恢复生产，日产煤八百吨。据调查该矿区面积东西长三十余里，南北宽五里至八里，煤层最浅一丈，深者八丈，普通为三丈。该窑自去年被我军收复时，旧窑破坏不堪，机器残缺，我民主政府为了人民的利益，与扶助发展私人的企业，便于去年十一月下旬与该矿原主翟乐安先生商筹复工办法，经济局并以二千万元现金作为扶植该窑基金，在各处以高价招来技术工人，又加当地群众的协助，经一个半月的时间，修洞整理机器终于在今年二月开始复工。在劳资关系上，改善了过去资方高度剥削工人及打骂制度。现在我民主政府领导下，一切皆以民主方式处理，首先确定了工人有参加管理工厂与爱护矿场的责任，同时也有讨论各种工人工资与各种制度的权利，资方有解决工人各种困难的义务，确定工资与粮价时，必经工人小组或大会同意始能有效，开除工人须经工会同意。现该窑计有工人一千二百十四名，窑工占百分之六十，机工占百分之十，杂工占百分之十五，工头占百分之十，职员占百分之五。工人每日工资最高为二百元（合小米一斗六升），最低六十元，平均一般工资一百四十元。每天除自己费用五十元外，能养活五口至七口，除薪金外，还津贴工人家庭烧煤，每月每人二百斤至二百五十斤。如不要煤可按每斤三毛折价。以上都由民主方式经厂方提出再经工人讨论确定。由于劳资关系的改善，工人生活的提高，工人们不但关心矿窑的前途与煤的成本和销路，同时也警惕特务坏人的破坏，生产量较过去增加百分之三十。他们还自动提出每天每人减发半两油，全窑每天可省油卅五斤，该窑原每日计产煤五百至六百吨，现已提高至八百余吨（一百一十余万斤）。厂方为鼓励工人积极生产，规定奖励办法：每日多出煤一笼者，即奖洋四十元，多出十笼以上者，每笼奖五十元，二十笼以上者每笼奖六十元。因此各窑工人都展开了生产竞赛，每日均能多出十五至二十笼左右。
