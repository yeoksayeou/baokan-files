　　Review Government Work to Determine Policy
    Zhang City Holds First Council Meeting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 14th] The first session of the Zhangjiakou City Council, lasting half a month, solemnly concluded on the 10th, after successfully completing the tasks entrusted by 170,000 citizens to establish major municipal plans and elect the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the municipal government. The council began discussing proposals on the 2nd of this month. The original proposals totaled 333, and after being grouped, synthesized, discussed, and passed, there were a total of 14 major items. The first item discussed by the council was the "Regarding Zhang City's Current Policy Direction" case proposed by the CPC Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee, which was unanimously passed after two days of discussion. The second case passed by the council concerned the issue of rent, which is of great importance to all residents of the city. A decision was made after several studies by a special committee and on-site investigations. To encourage private investment in real estate operations, the existence of "second landlords" (二房东) is permitted. The most heated debate revolved around the types and amounts of taxes, with the consensus being that the principles should be fairness, reasonableness, simplicity, and ease of implementation, while also considering the city's minimum necessary financial expenditures. The final resolution unanimously passed included: (1) Changing the business income tax to a unified progressive tax. (2) Exempting businesses with license fees, such as grain, fresh and dried fruits, and small-scale businesses, from business tax. (3) Implementing a license tax for small businesses, levied based on income levels, with exemptions for impoverished small businesses. The council also approved the municipal government's budget for the 34th year of the Republic. Elections were held on the 9th, with all ninety-one official councilors in attendance. Candidates were freely and unrestrictedly nominated by councilors through joint signatures. After introductions and campaigning, Liu Xiufeng was elected as the Chairman of the City Council with 75 votes, Yu Dehai with 70 votes, and Chen Zhaoren with 59 votes as Vice-Chairmen, and Yang Chunfu was elected as a government member. Communist Party members accounted for only three of these positions. Finally, Yang Chunfu was elected as the Mayor with 90 votes, and Zhang Mengxu was elected as the Deputy Mayor with 85 votes.
