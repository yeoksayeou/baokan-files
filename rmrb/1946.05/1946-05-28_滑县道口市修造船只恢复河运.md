　　Hua County Daokou City Repairs and Builds Boats to Restore River Transport
    [This newspaper, Heze News] Daokou City in Hua County, in preparation for transporting wheat and restoring river transport to facilitate trade, has now issued interest-free loans of 1.7 million yuan through public-operated stores to support boat owners in repairing and building boats. The Wei River had smooth river transport before the war, with boats lining the wharves for a length of eight li. Since being occupied by the enemy, the waterway was cut off, and one-third of the city's boat owners and workers lost their jobs. Now, with loans from public-operated stores, they are rushing to repair and build fourteen boats, employing 150 workers, and can transport 600 shi per day. With the restoration of river transport, Daokou's industry and commerce will be further developed.
