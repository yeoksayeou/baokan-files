　　[This dispatch from Changzhi] Taihang's Jiji, Xiyang, Zanhuang, and other places are implementing rent reduction through investigation in conjunction with production, with the following approaches: Xiaodian Village in Jiji uses small-scale rent reduction reasoning meetings, totaling fifteen people, first convincing the landlord Li Zuoyan, and then resolving problems individually. Tenants raised a total of eleven issues, all of which the landlord acknowledged. In Hengshan Village, Xiyang, cadres participate in mutual aid groups, using spare time from eating and farming to discover problems and conduct ideological education, resolving them in evening meetings. The resolution methods are very flexible; small problems are resolved through reasoning in small meetings, while large problems are resolved in people's schools. In Wangjiaping, Zanhuang, it was discovered during leadership of production that tenant morale was low. After in-depth investigation, more than thirty unresolved rent reduction issues were found, mostly related to mountain estates, pauper's hovels, and relatives. On the 27th of last month, taking advantage of a rainy day, a large meeting was held to denounce the local tyrant landlord Hou Xinzhang. Wang Huancheng, the first to recount his grievances, said: "Hou Xinzhang is my uncle. I cannot escape poverty because he is oppressing me! I farmed one of his mountain estates, originally hoping that because we were relatives, the rent would be less. The first year, there was no land on the estate, so we agreed on a rent of two shi. When I had reclaimed twenty mu of land, he wanted to divide the rent, demanding three shi, so I could only get one shi. Until I had reclaimed all the land, he wouldn't let me farm it anymore. I begged from door to door, and my eldest son starved to death. Is this cruel behavior that of an uncle? He has a heart more savage than a wolf!" Hou Xinzhang, knowing he was in the wrong, admitted to returning the rent and land seized by force. Wang Huancheng's approach of breaking through personal considerations moved many people, and they raised issues one after another. The cadres also became determined, guaranteeing thorough investigation and rent reduction without leaving any loose ends.

　　太行汲淇、昔阳等县生产中贯彻查减
    干部在参加领导生产中，发现问题灵活解决。
    【本报长治讯】太行汲淇、昔阳、赞皇等地，结合生产贯彻查减有以下几种作法：汲淇小店村运用小型减租说理会的形式，共十五人，先把地主李作彦说倒，然后分别解决问题，佃户共提出问题十一件，地主都承认了。昔阳横山村，干部分别参加互助组，利用吃饭种地的余暇，发现问题，并进行思想教育，晚上开会解决，解决方法很灵活，小问题召开小型会说理解决，大问题在民校解决。赞皇王家坪，从领导生产中发现佃户情绪不高，深入检查，发现未减租问题三十余件，属于山庄窝铺及亲属关系的较多。上月二十七日，利用天雨空隙，召开了斗争恶霸地主侯新彰的大会，第一个诉苦的王焕成说：“侯新彰是我的姑夫，我受穷翻不了身，就是他压的哩！我种了他的一个山庄，原想靠着亲戚，租子可少一点，头一年，庄上没地，说定两石租，等我修地修到二十亩了，他就要分租，打三石我才能分一石，直到把地都修好，就不让我种了，我沿门讨饭，把大儿子也饿死了，这难难还算姑夫吗？比狼的心还狠哩！”侯新彰自知理屈，承认退租退霸地，王焕成这种破除情面的作法感动了许多人，纷纷提出问题，干部也有了决心，保证彻底查减不留尾巴。
