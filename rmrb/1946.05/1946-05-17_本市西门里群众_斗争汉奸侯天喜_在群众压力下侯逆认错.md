　　Residents of West Gate in This City
    Struggle Against Traitor Hou Tianxi
    Under Pressure from the Masses, Traitor Hou Admits His Mistakes
    [This City News] The recent anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement in Handan City has shifted from large-scale gatherings of tens of thousands of people to smaller gatherings of hundreds of people for struggle sessions, deepening the movement and giving the masses ample opportunity to speak. On the 9th of this month, more than 400 residents of West Gate gathered to struggle against Hou Tianxi, a special agent of the Handan County Police Station. When Hou Tianxi was dragged out of the crowd, the masses were furious and shouted to settle accounts with him. Relying on his power, he had seized Duan Guo’s house, driving Guo out onto the streets in the dead of winter. He had a gramophone repaired at Kang Huaiyuan’s watch repair shop, paying only 50 yuan out of 500 yuan. He bought 200 yuan worth of meat from Han Cunyi without paying. Rickshaw puller Ren Sheng pulled him through the water for three or four hours, only receiving 30 yuan. Peng Rong was beaten severely for not standing at attention when he saw him, and became ill as a result. He drove Feng Xiangting's family, who had raised him since he was little and helped him marry and build a house, out of their rented house before the lease expired, and raped Jia Yujing's daughter, etc. During the accusations, some of the masses cried loudly because they recalled their painful past. Some of the masses also shouted and cursed angrily, filled with hatred. Under the pressure of the masses, Hou Tianxi had no choice but to lower his head and admit his mistakes in public.

　　本市西门里群众
    斗争汉奸侯天喜
    在群众压力下侯逆认错
    【本市讯】邯郸市最近的反奸诉苦运动，由大型的万人集会转为小型的数百人的集会斗争，使运动深入，给群众以充分的发言机会。本月九日，西门里四百多群众集会斗争为邯郸县警察所特务侯天喜。当侯天喜从人群中被拉出来时，群众愤怒、高呼要同他算总账。他仗着他的势力，霸占过段郭氏的房子，寒冬腊月把郭氏骗赶到街头。在康怀远的修表铺修了留声机，五百元只给五十元。买了韩存义二百元钱的肉不给钱。洋车夫任生涉水拉了他三四个钟头，只给三十元；彭荣看见了他没有立正，被毒打一顿，病了一场，自小养育他，并给他娶妻盖房的冯香亭家。被他从赁期未满的房中轰出去，并强奸过贾玉经的闺女等。群众在控诉时，有的因忆起痛苦的过去而放声痛哭。有的群众还高喊怒骂，恨入骨髓。侯天喜在群众的压力下，不得不当众低头认错。
