　　Heze Social Education Active
    Jiaozuo City Establishes Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    [Our Newspaper, Heze News] With the support of the democratic government, social education in Heze City has greatly developed. The Social Education Center now has a collection of over 15,000 books, as well as various newspapers, magazines, and books from various liberated areas. Readers are constantly crowding in from morning till night; the Yan'an *Liberation Daily* is especially popular among readers. Many instruments and specimens are also quite eye-catching. The Xinhua Stadium is under construction, and literacy classes for both men and women have been established in various streets. In West Street alone, there are three literacy classes for women. East Main Street has a newspaper reading group, which was jointly established by the poor and peddlers. They used grain acquired through struggle to subscribe to several newspapers, which are placed in the cooperative for regular reading. At every intersection in the city, there is a blackboard newspaper, written by the citizens of Heze themselves. It continuously carries news of current events and information related to current work. When the public trial of the traitor Sun Huajian was held, the board was written with vivid phrases such as "Go! Go! Go avenge!"! The blackboard is surrounded by people, and the baskets of the peddlers are often crushed. There are currently eight elementary schools in Heze City, each with an attached adult class specifically for educating poor farmers and peddlers. Many peddlers in Heze City have words pasted on their baskets. One peddler selling fried dough sticks pasted characters such as "Chairman Mao" and "fried dough sticks" on his basket to learn literacy. They have also organized Yangge teams, and theatrical troupes such as Minyou and Dazhong, and are constantly performing plays that suit the tone of the citizens.
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi News] The cultural and intellectual circles of Jiaozuo City established the Jiaozuo City Federation of Literary and Art Circles on the 8th of this month, in order to invigorate the city's cultural and recreational life and organize research on academic and current affairs. A comprehensive popular publication will also be published. Ye Feng, Zhang Zhenya, and twelve others were elected as directors.

　　荷泽社会教育活跃
    焦作市成立文联
    【本报荷泽讯】在民主政府扶持下，荷泽市社会教育已有很大开展。社会教育馆，现藏书一万五千余册，并有各解放区各种报纸、杂志、书刊、从早到晚，读者拥挤不断；延安解放日报，读者特别踊跃；不少仪器标本亦颇引人注目。新华体育场正在建设中，各街已成立了男女识字班，西街仅妇女识字班就有三个。东大街有读报组，是贫民和小贩联合成立的，他们拿斗争粮食，订了几份报，在合作社里放着经常看。全市每个十字街头，一块黑板报，由荷泽市民自己推人编写，不断写着时事和配合当前工作的消息，当公审汉奸孙华剑时，板上写着“去！去！去报仇”等生动字句！黑板前围满人，小贩的篮子都被挤坏了。荷市现有八处小学，每处都附设成年班，是专门教育贫苦农民和小贩的。荷市不少小贩的篮子上都贴着字，曾有一个卖油条的小贩，在篮子上贴着“毛主席”和“油条”等字样，学习识字。他们也组织了秧歌队，和民友、大众等剧社，还不断出演合于市民口吻的话剧。
    【本报长治讯】焦作市文化知识界，于本月八日成立焦作市文化界联合会，以活跃该市文化娱乐生活，组织学术时事的研究，并将出版一综合性的通俗刊物，叶枫、张振亚等十二人，当选理事。
