　　Amidst Congressional Passage of Anti-Labor Bill,
    American 400,000 Miners Resume General Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 27th Dispatch] New York News: All of America's 400,000 coal miners resumed their strike at midnight on the 25th. It is reported that the 400,000 coal miners initially began a strike on April 1st, which lasted for six weeks. They temporarily resumed work after government mediation, with a 40-day limit for negotiations with mine owners. However, the mine owners still insisted on rejecting the workers' reasonable demands, causing the negotiations to break down, thus the strike has restarted. The 400,000 coal miners' resumption of the strike coincides with the passage of the reactionary anti-labor bill by the American Congress. The coal miners' strike will exacerbate the national crisis caused by the general strike of railway workers. The American national newspapers have suffered a serious blow due to the railway and coal mine strikes. Many newspapers have cancelled their advertising sections, and the page sizes have also been reduced. For example, the Los Angeles Times published eight pages on Saturday, without any advertisements, and stated that the page size will be further reduced in the future. The Howard newspaper chain announced that the Pittsburgh News, Washington Daily, and others will cancel advertisements starting today.
    Another Dispatch: Railway workers, whose strike has caused huge losses to the United States, ended their strike on the 25th, having obtained an increase of 18.5 cents per hour.
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 27th Dispatch] According to London Broadcasting: After 250,000 American railway workers announced their strike on the 24th, the American Congress immediately passed an anti-labor bill, granting the President extraordinary powers, namely, the power to order the cessation of strikes in state-run industrial sectors. If the President's warnings are not heeded, striking workers will be fined $5,000 and imprisoned for one year, and the striking workers will be transferred to military service.
    Another dispatch from French News Agency: On the 25th, the American Senate passed a bill by a vote of 50 to 25, requiring unions to announce their intention to strike 60 days before the actual work stoppage.

　　议会通过反劳工法案声中
    美国四十万矿工重新举行大罢工
    【新华社延安二十七日电】纽约讯：全美四十万煤矿工人，于二十五日午夜重新举行罢工。按四十万煤矿工人于四月一日即开始罢工，曾坚持六周之久，后因政府出面调停暂时复工，以四十天为限，与矿主进行谈判。但由于矿主仍坚持拒绝工人的合理要求，使谈判陷于破裂，因此罢工复起。四十万煤矿工人重新罢工之时，正是美议会通过反动的反劳工法案之后。煤矿工人之罢工，将加剧铁路工人总罢工所造成的国家危机。美全国报纸已因铁路和煤矿罢工遭受严重打击，许多报纸已取消了广告版，版面亦缩小，例如洛杉机时代报，星期六出版八版，即无广告，并谓此后版面亦将减少。霍华德系报业公司，宣告匹兹堡新闻、华盛顿日报等，均将自今日起取消广告。
    又讯：因罢工而使美国遭受巨大损失的铁路工人，已在获得每小时工资增加一角八分五的条件下，于二十五日结束罢工。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】据伦敦广播：美二十五万铁路工人，于二十四日宣布罢工后，美国议会即通过一项反劳工法案，授予总统以非常全权，即在国营各工业部门如有罢工，总统有命令制止之权，如不听总统警告等，则罢工工人每人得处五千元罚金与一年监禁，并将罢工工人转入军队服务。
    另据法新闻处讯：二十五日美参院以五十票对二十五票通过一法案，强迫工会在实际停工前六十天，即须宣布其罢工之意图。
