    Yantai Workers and Poor People Organize Various Cooperatives
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 24th] In addition to the Changlu salt industry, which has been reported on previously, Jidong has also seen development in fruit and other industries. The fishing industry along the coast of the Bohai Sea is traditionally well-developed, especially the Luanxian fishing ground, which was the largest, with over 20,000 fishermen and over 1,800 odd-jobbers before the war. The annual output of fish and shrimp was over 100 million jin. The local democratic government has now provided loans of 60 million yuan specifically for the purpose of promoting the fishing industry. The mountainous areas of northern Jidong, such as Qian'an and Zunhua, are rich in more than ten kinds of fruits, with an annual output of over 2.5 million jin, which are sold to various parts of North China. This spring, the democratic governments in various places helped the masses to universally organize dried and fresh fruit cooperatives to improve planting and storage methods in order to export large quantities. In industrial production, such as the paper-making industry in Qian'an, more than 600 paper mills have now resumed work, and preparations are underway to establish a public-private paper company. The Lin Nancang area of Yutian is rich in reeds. There are now more than 100,000 people engaged in weaving and transporting reed mats, with a monthly output of 250,000 to 300,000 pieces. The textile industry is concentrated in Baodi, Yutian, and other places. The Xinxu and Qukou areas of Baodi County can weave 70,000 bolts of native cloth per month, while the Woluogu and Hongyaqiao areas of Yutian can weave 60,000 bolts per month. The democratic government has invested 90 million yuan to develop the textile industry.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 20th] Workers and poor people in Yantai City have now formed textile, marketing, fertilizer production, fishing, and brick and tile cooperatives, each with 76,533 members and 1,389,000 yuan in shares. The government has also provided loans of 633,800 yuan. These cooperatives have all implemented profit-sharing between labor and capital, and their business is thriving. The hostels operated by the marketing cooperative are priced one-third lower than the market price, earning a profit of 35,900 yuan in six months. The textile cooperative earned a profit of over 30,000 yuan in one month. In the past six months, the cooperative's capital has grown to over 300,000 yuan, and the number of members has increased to 2,500. Currently, each district in Yantai City has a cooperative to promote the cooperative cause throughout the district.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 24th] The Jiaodong Jinglun Silk Factory, recently joined forces with the Donghai, Beihai, and other silk factories to establish the Xinchang Silk Satin Store in Yantai to promote the finished products of various factories. Since its opening a month ago, it has sold more than 400 bolts of silk and more than 50 packages of Dachang silk.
