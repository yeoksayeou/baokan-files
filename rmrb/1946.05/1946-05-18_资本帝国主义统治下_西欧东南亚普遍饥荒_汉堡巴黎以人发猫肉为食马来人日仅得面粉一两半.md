　　Under Capitalist Imperialist Rule
    Widespread Famine in Western Europe and Southeast Asia
    Hamburg and Paris Eat Human Hair and Cat Meat; Malaysians Receive Only One and a Half Taels of Flour Per Day
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Comprehensive reports: Western European capitalist countries and Asian colonies such as China and those under foreign rule in Southeast Asia are facing severe famine. In Central Europe, the number of people starving to death in Italy, Greece, and Germany is increasing daily. Italians can only obtain one-third of their minimum food requirements. Recently, the Italian Minister of Food declared that the situation cannot be changed because the relief food has been delayed. The daily calorie intake per person in Greece has dropped to 600-700 calories, while the minimum daily requirement is 2,200 calories, and it is continuing to decrease. Unrest is increasing in western Germany, and British and American authorities have increased troop deployments. Hospitals in Hamburg are making food from human hair to feed patients, claiming that hair contains nutrients. Eating cats is common in French cities; in Paris alone, 10,000 cats have disappeared. Before Soviet aid, French people's daily rations had been reduced to four liang. According to people who have visited France, the French people are all yellow and emaciated due to insufficient food. In addition, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, and Norway are also experiencing severe hunger. Food rations in Britain itself are also being reduced daily. In Asia, countless people have died of starvation in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Guizhou. According to a Central News Agency report on the 10th of this month, the number of famine victims has increased to 30 million. In India, more than 3.5 million people have starved to death. Malaya is still short of 60% of its food needs, and the current daily flour ration per person will be reduced from seven ounces to two ounces (equivalent to one and a half taels). Ceylon and the Philippines also urgently need food relief. Even Burma, known as a rice granary, is experiencing food shortages. It is said that if relief is not received by the end of June, more than 10 million people in Southeast Asia will die of starvation, and the famine will continue. The main reason for this famine is the poor economic systems of the above-mentioned countries. The Soviet News Agency recently published a report by its special correspondent visiting the American occupation zone in Germany, proving that the famine in western Germany was caused by landlords abandoning land and farmers' low production morale. In other places, such as India, bureaucratic habits, corruption of rulers, and speculation by merchants have exacerbated the famine. While war damage has indeed affected food production, the Soviet Union claims that under the Soviet system, although the war damage suffered by the Soviet Union was more severe than any other country, it is still able to produce enough food. The war damage in Eastern European countries and eastern Germany is also more severe than in Western Europe, but thanks to land reform, the people are also spared from starvation. Therefore, Soviet newspapers emphasize that the solution to hunger in various places lies in implementing land reform and ending imperialist rule.

　　资本帝国主义统治下
    西欧东南亚普遍饥荒
    汉堡巴黎以人发猫肉为食马来人日仅得面粉一两半
    【新华社延安十三日电】综合报导：西欧资本主义国家及亚洲的中国及在外国统治下的东南亚各殖民地，正陷严重的饥荒。中欧洲方面，意、希、德等国饿毙的人数，日益增加。意大利每人只能获得最低粮食的三分之一。最近意粮食部长宣称：由于救济的粮食延宕未至，情况无法改变。希腊每人每日所得粮食的热量，已降至六百至七百卡罗里，每日所需的热量，最少限度为二千二百卡罗里，而且正在继续减少中。德国西部骚动事件日益增加，英美当局已增兵戒备。汉堡医院将人发制成食品，给病人吃，据说头发中含有营养料，以猫为食的事件，在法国城内甚是普遍，仅巴黎一地，即有一万只猫失踪，在苏联援助以前，法人每日口粮已减至四两。据到法国考察的人说，法国人民都因食不足饱而面黄饥瘦。此外荷、比、卢、奥、西、挪等国，亦在严重的饥饿中。英国本国的粮食配给，亦在日益缩减。在亚洲方面：中国两广、两湖、河南、贵州等省的人民死于饥饿者，不可胜计。据中央社本月十日电称：饥民已增至三千万人，印度已有三百五十余万人民活活饿毙。马来亚尚缺粮食百分之六十，目前每日每人的麦粉配给，将由七盎斯减到二盎斯（即等于一两半）。锡兰、菲岛亦急需粮食救济，连素以米仓著称的缅甸，亦感粮食不足。据称：倘若在六月底以前得不到救济，东南亚将有千余万人死于饥饿，饥荒将继续延长下去。这次粮荒的主要原因，是上述各国的经济制度的不良。苏联消息报最近发表其特派记者访问德境美占领区的报导，证明由于地主的荒废土地，与农民生产情绪的低落，造成了德西部的饥馑。在其他地方，如印度，由于统治者的官僚习气贪污腐化，商人的囤积居奇，而使饥荒更加严重化。战争的破坏固影响粮食生产，然苏联方面宣称，在苏联制度下，虽然苏联所遭的战争破坏较任何其他国家为剧，而目前仍能生产足够的粮食。东欧诸国及德国东部的战争破坏，亦较西欧为剧，但由于土地改革的结果，人民亦免于饥饿。因而苏联报纸强调解决各地饥饿的办法，乃在于实行土地改革及结束帝国主义的统治。
