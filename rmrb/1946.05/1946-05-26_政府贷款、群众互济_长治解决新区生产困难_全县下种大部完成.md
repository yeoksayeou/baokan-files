　　Government Loans, Mass Mutual Aid
    Changzhi Solves Production Difficulties in New Districts
    Most of County's Sowing Completed
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 23rd] Changzhi's newly liberated areas have gained the following experience in solving problems such as draft animals, farm tools, fertilizer, seeds, and the spring famine in the production movement: (1) The increase in draft animals mainly relies on government loans and the fruits obtained from rent reduction, with planned organization of buying livestock, with great results. According to statistics from 79 villages across the county: 166 livestock were newly purchased, most of which were bought through mutual aid partnerships. Secondly, the universal organization of people pulling plows has solved the shortage of draft power. (2) In addition to organizing the purchase of farm tools with the fruits of rent reduction and dividends from sideline production, iron and wood craftsmen and farmers are organized to exchange labor. Farm tool stations have also been specially set up in Guancun and other places to facilitate farmers' repair and purchase. (3) In the eastern mountain areas, large-scale organization of composting fertilizer is carried out. The Guxian Village in the Second District composted more than 30,000 dan of fertilizer. (4) Regarding the seed and spring famine problem, in addition to allocating grain and funds for relief, the government launched a widespread mutual aid and mutual borrowing movement. Due to disaster and famine in the East Street of Handian Town in the Third District, the West Street lent 30 shi of grain. Bao Village lent 10 shi of seeds to Ci Village. The farmers, who have overcome the difficulties, are even more enthusiastic about production than before. At present, most of the county's sowing has been completed and is currently in the final sprint.

　　政府贷款、群众互济
    长治解决新区生产困难       
    全县下种大部完成
    【本报长治二十三日讯】长治新解放区在生产运动中，解决耕畜、农具、肥料、种籽与春荒等问题上，已获得如下经验：（一）耕畜增加主要靠政府贷款与减租中所得果实，有计划组织买牲口，成绩很大。据全县七十九个村统计：增买牲口一百六十六头，大部是互助合伙买的。其次是普遍组织人拉犁，解决了畜力的不足。（二）农具除组织以减租果实及副业生产之红利购买外，又组织铁木匠与农民变工，关村等地并专门设立了农具站，以便利农民修理和购买。（三）肥料在东境山地，大量组织沤粪，二区故县村即沤粪三万多担。（四）种籽与春荒问题，政府除拨粮款救济外，发动了广泛的互济互借运动，第三区韩店镇东街因灾荒缺粮，西街就借给粮食三十石。鲍村借给祠村种籽十石。战胜了困难后的农民，生产情绪较前更为高涨。现全县下种已大部完成，刻正最后突击中。
