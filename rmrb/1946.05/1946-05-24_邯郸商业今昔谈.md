　　Talking About the Past and Present of Commerce in Handan

　　Open up a map of Hebei Province, and you'll find that Handan is a place with convenient transportation, a relatively moderate position in our border region, and abundant products. The Pinghan Railway stretches north and south from its side. The Handan-Changzhi Railway reaches Shangdang to the west. The Fuyang River converges with the Ziya River and flows directly to Tianjin, and before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were as many as two thousand ships carrying dozens of tons of cargo. The cotton production of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area accounts for about one-half of the total cotton production in North China, and Handan is located on the transportation hub of this cotton-producing area. To the west, coal, iron, mountain goods, medicinal materials, hemp, porcelain... from the Taihang Mountains are mostly exported from Handan. In any aspect, Handan has excellent conditions to become a modern industrial and commercial city.

　　However, before October 4, 1945, Handan was suffocated and strangled.

　　It is said that around the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), Handan had gradually "prospered". But behind the so-called "prosperity" at that time, there were countless farmers' suffering and an increasingly deepening crisis. At that time, the largest trades were cotton, grain, mountain goods, groceries, and cloth. A large amount of cotton and mountain goods were transported to Tianjin and Beijing via the Pinghan Railway. Cotton fields increased, grain fields decreased, and grain merchants transported grain from Henan and Hubei to Handan, some of which was sold in nearby counties, and some was transported to Tianjin and Beijing. At its peak, it processed 100,000 shi of various grains every day. On the other hand, foreign cloths and groceries also poured in in large quantities. The most warehouses numbered more than sixty, and foreign merchants often stationed two or three thousand people. Merchants called this period the "Golden Age". They did make a lot of money in reselling, but they did not have solid funds. They acted as intermediaries for unequal exchange for foreign merchants. Therefore, the Handan market at that time was very lively on the surface, but very empty in its bones, and extremely speculative. The broad masses of farmers became increasingly impoverished in this unequal transaction.

　　When the Japanese imperialist invaders invaded Handan in 1937, they immediately and cruelly and thoroughly "transformed" this semi-colonial "free trade." Everything was ruled. Handan changed again.

　　On the surface, Handan was even more "prosperous." The number of businesses increased from 329 before the war to 1,652 in August 1945. Under the "Greater Handan" construction plan, large roads appeared in Southwest Village, and electric lights were installed.

　　Why did the enemy actively "build" Handan? We won't talk about the military and political "significance" here. The economic conspiracy alone is enough to be alarming. If we analyze the commercial situation during the enemy-puppet period, cotton firms, grain firms, warehouses, fur goods, etc. account for 516 of these 1,653 businesses. Regardless of the subjective wishes of these businesses, the enemy used them to absorb large quantities of valuable materials such as cotton, oil, and waste metal materials. Moreover, through them, they dumped various luxury Japanese goods. According to rough estimates, the enemy absorbed 10 million jin of cotton from Handan every year, and cotton seeds from September to March and April of the following year, averaging 200,000 jin per day. The flour company came forward with about 10 million jin per year, most of which was absorbed except for a portion reserved for local enemy-puppet military use. (As for scrap metal, it was plundered by way of dedication, and the amount was also astonishing.) The so-called absorption here is just a euphemism for looting. For example, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, southern Hebei was rich in native cloth, which was sold in Shanxi and made great profits. The weaving income of rural women accounted for a considerable proportion of farmers' total income. The enemy burned farmers' weaving tools, ordered farmers to grow cotton, and sold it at prices below cost. Of course, the farmers were overwhelmed by this, and the merchants, except those related to the enemy and designated by the enemy to absorb cotton, were also idle and unprofitable. Grain firms, which used to account for a large proportion of Handan's trade, still had 87 firms, but except for a very few who had a relationship with the enemy and directly or indirectly absorbed grain for the enemy, the majority of grain merchants had to reduce their business due to heavy donations and taxes, heavy restrictions on freight transportation, and the danger of being confiscated for being accused of "hoarding and hoarding." Grain firms that used to store tens of thousands of bags of grain were changed to retail grain stalls, relying only on the "dou yong" nature of profits to make a living. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, coal yards were also an important trade in Handan. Dozens of coal yards of various sizes were located in the suburbs of Handan and the villages along the Fuyang River, transporting coal from Wu'an, Jiaozuo and other places, and relying on the Fuyang River water transport to the interior of southern Hebei. About 100,000 people directly and indirectly relied on Fuyang shipping for a living. At this time, the enemy robbed all the coal, and the people were deprived of the right to burn coal. By August 1945, only two coal yards were left in Handan.

　　However, some commercial sectors became unprecedentedly "prosperous." There were a total of 491 foreign and Guangdong grocery stores, restaurants, brothels, and opium dens. The development of this kind of commerce, which promoted cheap luxury goods of the enemy and supplied the extravagant life of the enemy-puppet regime, only showed that Handan was becoming more colonialized. Of course, the population of Handan City had increased significantly after the War of Resistance Against Japan compared with before the war. Some of these increased populations were merchants (whose business was detrimental to the country and the people as mentioned above), and the vast majority were puppet officials who came here to live off of the parasites, and the poor people who were squeezed by the enemy-puppet regime in the countryside and came here to make a living.

　　It must be admitted that the number of businesses in Handan was greatly reduced after the initial liberation, and some commercial sectors were "depressed." There are many reasons for this, such as some illegal merchants who had relations with the enemy ran away; some merchants did not fully understand the trade policies of the democratic government; and the Nationalist reactionaries launched a civil war and blockaded traffic, making freight transportation difficult, etc. But to analyze it from the essence, this "depression" is not surprising. On the contrary, the reduction of some businesses that trafficked in foreign luxury goods and absorbed materials for the enemy is beneficial to the people and the country. The colonial economic nature changed with the liberation of Handan.

　　Due to the promotion and support of the democratic government, Handan's commerce has rapidly recovered and increased. As of the end of April this year, the number of established businesses has increased to 1,019, and the number of peddlers has developed more rapidly than before. Comparing today's businesses with those during the enemy-puppet rule will lead to a gratifying conclusion.

　　During the enemy-puppet rule, there were a total of 25 brothels and opium dens. Now, opium dens have long disappeared, and the vast majority of prostitutes have changed careers to engage in production. This is a healthy phenomenon and is unprecedented in all of China. The number of cloth stores selling foreign cloth has decreased from 130 in the past to the current 21, but at the same time, a large number of native cloth stores and native cloth peddlers have increased. Eliminating leakage and using domestic goods are our goals today. The ideals of many progressive economists have been realized in today's Handan. The number of cotton firms was 186 in the past, but now it is 11. The cotton firms in the past were to absorb cotton for the enemy, and the cotton firms today are aimed at regulating the surplus and deficiency of the liberated areas. This year, southern Hebei has planted a very wide area of cotton, and it is estimated that the number of cotton firms will increase significantly this autumn. It will become a good business that benefits both people and themselves.

　　Many other industries have also increased. The number of coal yards has increased from two during the enemy-puppet period to the current 20. Coal from the Taihang Mountains is continuously transported eastward, and the pain of having no coal to burn in southern Hebei has become a thing of the past. 88 new cigarette industries have emerged. Cigarettes are a huge consumption. The materials in the liberated areas plus the labor in the liberated areas have stopped so many leakages. The number of silver shops has increased from five in the past to the current seven. The privately-owned Ruihua Bank is about to open. If the financial industry is a barometer of a market, then the Handan market in the future will definitely become active with the development of the financial industry.

　　The democratic government has spared no effort in the restoration of Handan's industry and commerce. 1.7 million yuan of poverty alleviation loans saved more than 4,000 people. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Bank not only gave them loans without interest or at low interest, but also helped them settle down according to their different living conditions. General industrial and commercial loans have reached 16 million yuan within half a year. Many businesses have received help from the bank, some of which have immediately resumed business, and some of which are expanding their operations. In the past, the enemy-puppet regime officially collected 24 kinds of taxes. Now, the government only plans to collect business income tax and tobacco and alcohol tax. The problem of supporting the army, which was the most headache for merchants, has been greatly reduced. Compared with today and the past, it is simply incomparable. The highways and roads have been restored and expanded, and east-west trade is unprecedentedly smooth. The economies of the mountainous and plain areas are integrated, which is a good time for merchants to make a fortune. The government is afraid that merchants will not make money. It not only supports commerce from the outside, but also tries to regulate shopkeeper disputes from the inside, appropriately improve the treatment of shop assistants, and improve their work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, which is also beneficial to shop owners. Under the promotion and support of the democratic government, we will soon see a new and prosperous Handan City. The merchants here will be the happiest.

### 邯郸商业今昔谈

　　邯郸商业今昔谈
    翻开河北省的地图，你会发现邯郸是个交通便利、在我边区地位较适中与物产丰饶的好地方。平汉路从它身旁向南北伸展开去。邯长路西达上党。滏阳河汇子牙河直达天津，载重几十吨的船只在抗战前曾有两千艘。晋冀鲁豫区的棉产约为华北棉产总数的二分之一，邯郸正在这个棉产区的交通要冲上。在西边，太行山的煤、铁、山货、药材、麻、瓷器……也多从邯郸出口。无论从那方面说，邯郸都有成为一个现代工商业都市的优良条件。
    但是，在三十四年十月四日以前，邯郸是被窒息与绞杀着的。
    据说在民国二十年左右，邯郸就已逐渐“繁荣”起来。但在当时之所谓“繁荣”的背后，却隐藏着无数农民的痛苦与日益加深的危机。那时候最大的贸易是棉花、粮食、山货、杂货、布匹。大批棉花、山货由平汉路运往平津。棉田增殖、粮田减少，粮商从河南、湖北把粮食运到邯郸，有的销行附近各县，有的运往平津。最高时每日吞吐各种粮食十万石。在另一方面，外来的洋布、杂货也大批侵进来。货栈最多时曾达六十多家，外来客商常驻者两三千人。商人们称这个时期为“黄金时代”。他们的确在转手之间赚了大钱，但是他们并没有殷实的资金，他们是替外商充当不等价交换的中介；所以那时的邯郸市场表面上非常活泼，骨子里却很空虚，投机性极大。而广大农民却在这种不等价交易中越来越贫困了。
    日本帝国侵略者在二十六年侵入邯郸，立刻就把这种半殖民地性的“自由贸易”残酷而彻底的“改造”了。一切都统治起来。邯郸又换了一番新面貌。
    从表面上看，邯郸是更加“繁荣”了。商号从事变前的三百二十九家增至三十四年八月的一千六百五十二家。在“大邯郸”的建设计划之下，西南庄出现了大马路，设置了电灯。
    敌人为什么这样积极的“建设”邯郸？军事、政治的“意义”这里不去说它。单是经济的阴谋已经够使人吃惊了。如果把敌伪在时的商业情况分析一下，在这一千六百五十三家商号中，棉花行、粮食行、货栈、皮货等共占五百一十六家，不管这些商号的主观意愿如何，敌人却是通过他们把大批的宝贵物资如棉花、油料、五金废料等吸收去了。而且也通过他们，倾销各种奢侈性的日货。据粗略的估计，敌人每年从邯郸吸收的棉花达一千万斤，棉籽从九月到翌年三、四月，每天平均吸收二十万斤，面粉公司每年出面约一千万斤，除一部分留为当地敌伪军用外，大部分也被吸收走了。（至于五金废料，则是以献纳方式掠夺而去，数目也很惊人）这里所谓吸收，只是一个抢掠的代名词。例如抗战前冀南盛产土布，行销山西，获利极大。农妇的纺织收入在农民的整个收入中占了相当大的比重。敌人烧毁农民的纺织工具，勒令农民种棉，并以低于成本的价钱卖给它。农民们当然因此被压得喘不过气来，就是商人们除了与敌人有关，被敌人指定代为吸收棉花的“指定商”以外，广大的正当商人也都无事可作无利可图了。过去占邯郸贸易大宗的粮行虽然还有八十七家，其中除了极少数与敌人有关系、直接间接替敌人吸收粮食者外，广大粮商则因为捐税苛重，货运遭受重重限制，并常常被指为“囤集居奇”而遭没收的危险，故不得不缩小营业。往日存粮几万包的粮行改为零买零售的粮摊，只靠着“斗佣”性质的利润糊口。抗战前煤栈也是邯郸重要贸易之一，邯郸城郊及沿滏阳河畔的村镇曾有大小规模的煤栈数十家，从武安、焦作等地运来煤炭，靠着滏阳河水运入冀南内地。直接间接依靠滏阳船运为生的约有十万人。这时候敌人把煤炭都抢夺走了，老百姓被剥夺了烧煤的权利，到三十四年八月，全邯郸的煤栈只剩了两家。
    但是，也有一部分商业空前的“繁荣”起来。洋广杂货、饭馆、妓院、土膏店等总数有四百九十一家。这种推销敌人廉价的奢侈品和供给敌伪奢糜生活的商业的发展，只能说明邯郸的更加殖民地化。当然，邯郸市的人口在抗战后比抗战前曾有大量的增加，这些增加的人口中有一部分是商人（其营业的不利于国家、人民已如上述），绝大部分还是到这里寄生的伪属，和在乡下被敌伪压榨不能生活而到这里谋生的贫民。
    不必讳言，邯郸的商号在初解放后曾经一度大为减少，某些商业是“萧条”了。这里面的原因很多，如一部分与敌人有关系的非法商人跑了；某些商人对民主政府的贸易政策还不够了解；由于国民党反动派发动内战、封锁交通而使货运不畅等。但要从本质上加以分析，这种“萧条”并不足奇，相反的某些贩运外来的奢侈品和替敌人吸收物资的商号减少，对人民、对国家倒是有好处的。殖民地的经济性质随着邯郸的解放而改变了。
    由于民主政府的提倡和扶植，邯郸的商业迅速的恢复和增加。截至今年四月底，坐商已增至一千零一十九户，摊贩比较以前更有飞跃的发展。把今天的商号与敌伪统治时的商号作一比较，将会得出一个可喜的结论。
    敌伪统治时妓院和土膏店共有二十五家。现在土膏店早经绝迹，绝大多数的妓女都转业从事生产了。这是一种健康的现象，在全中国都是空前的。贩运洋布的布行由过去的一百三十家减至现在的二十一家，但同时却增加了大量的土布店和土布摊贩。杜绝漏扈、服用国货正是我们今天的奋斗目标。许多进步经济学者的理想在今日的邯郸实现了。棉花行过去一百八十六家，现在是十一家。过去的棉行是为敌人吸收棉花，今天的棉行旨在调剂解放区的有无。今年冀南棉植极广，估计今秋棉行会有大量增加。它会成为一种利人利己的好生意。
    还有许多行业增加了。煤栈由敌伪在时的两家增至现在的二十家。太行山的煤炭源源东运，冀南区无煤烧的痛苦已经成了过去的事情。卷烟业新生了八十八家，纸烟为一巨大消耗，解放区的材料加上解放区的人工，不知杜绝了多少漏扈，银号由过去的五家增至现在的七家，私营瑞华银行已将开业。如果说金融业是一个市场的寒暑表，那么今后的邯郸市场，一定会随金融业的发展而活跃起来。
    民主政府对于邯郸工商业的恢复可谓不遗余力。一百七十万元的贫民贷款救活了四千多人。冀南银行不只无利或低利给他们贷款，而且根据各自不同的生活条件，帮助他们安家。一般工商业贷款，半年内已达一千六百万元。许多商号得到银行的帮助，有的立即复业，有的正在扩大经营。过去敌伪正式征收的各种税款有二十四种，现在政府只准备征收营业所得税和烟酒税。为商人所最头痛的支差问题大为减少，以今日和过去比较，简直是不可同日而语的，公路大道恢复展修，东西贸易空前通畅，山地平原的经济融为一体，正是商人发财的好时候，政府唯恐商人不赚钱，它不但从外部扶植商业，而且从内部设法调节店东纠纷，适当改善店员待遇，提高他们的工作积极性与责任心，这对店主同样是有利的。在民主政府的提倡与扶植下，我们不久就会看到一个崭新而繁荣的邯郸市。这里的商人将是最幸福的。
