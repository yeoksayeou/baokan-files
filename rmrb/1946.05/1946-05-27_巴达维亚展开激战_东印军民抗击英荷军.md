　　Batavia Sees Fierce Fighting
　　East Indian Army and People Resist British and Dutch Troops
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] Batavia Dispatch: The East Indian war has expanded. In the Batavia area, British and Dutch troops and East Indian patriotic forces have engaged in fierce fighting. The sound of artillery and machine gun fire is constantly heard in the city. East Indian newspapers point out that the purpose of the Dutch and British troops' offensive is to destroy the fighting will of the East Indian people. The war is being conducted under the pretext of "countering extremists." East Indian newspapers report that the Dutch and British troops will pay a heavy price but will gain nothing. The East Indian people are prepared to fight to the end for freedom. The East Indian army has braved the intense firepower of British and Dutch air force and artillery for several weeks, holding its ground in Semarang and Surabaya and repelling enemy attacks, which is a manifestation of the East Indian people's fighting will. East Indian newspapers call on the United Nations Organization to reconsider the East Indian issue for the safety of 70 million people.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Batavia Dispatch: The Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Mook threatened East Indian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir, saying that he hoped that the next time he discussed the East Indian issue with Sjahrir, Sjahrir would give a yes or no answer to the Dutch proposals. Mook admitted at a press conference that there was still no agreement between him and Sjahrir. The East Indian side believes that Mook's remarks may be a signal for a new Dutch military offensive and can also be regarded as a failure to split the internal unity of East India. Previously, the Dutch side had claimed that Sjahrir and the moderate East Indian nationalists also agreed to the Dutch proposals, but they could not be implemented due to the opposition of extreme nationalists.

　　巴达维亚展开激战
    东印军民抗击英荷军
    【新华社延安二十四日电】巴达维亚讯：东印战事，业已扩大，巴达维亚区，英荷军与东印爱国军展开激战，城区不断听到大炮与机枪射击声。东印报纸指出荷英军的进攻目的，在于摧残东印人民的战斗意志，战事是“在反过激分子”的借口下进行的。东印各报纸载称：荷英军将付出严重代价，但不能得到任何东西。东印人民准备为自由奋斗到底。数周来东印军冒英荷空军与大炮的猛烈火力，在三宝垅、泗水坚持阵地，击退敌人进攻，便是东印人民战斗意志的一个表现。东印报纸呼吁联合国组织会为七千万人民的安全，重新考虑东印问题。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】巴达维亚讯：荷印副总督穆克，威胁东印共和国总理沙利尔称：他希望在下次他与沙利尔讨论东印问题时，沙利尔对荷兰的建议作出是或否的答复。穆克在记者招待会上，承认他与沙利尔之间尚无协议。东印方面认为穆克的谈话，可能为荷兰新军事进攻的信号，同时可视为分裂东印内部团结的失败。盖前此荷兰方面曾称，沙利尔及东印温和民族主义亦同意荷兰的建议，仅因极端民族主义者的反对未能实现。
