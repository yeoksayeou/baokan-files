　　“Some Rejoice, Some Grieve”
    Anyang Miscellany

      “A city of officials, half a city of people, the common folk don't count.
      Longing for the Central Government, hoping for the Central Government, but when the Central Government arrives, the people suffer.”

    This folk rhyme circulating in the streets and alleys of Anyang City is a good portrait of the city itself.

    Anyang streets are filled with soldiers and officials. The soldiers are still wearing cotton uniforms, while the officials are dressed in "wool." It is said that there are over 40,000 regular Kuomintang troops here, not including the incorporated puppet troops of Li Ying and Wang Ziquan. What about the civil officials? There are three special commissioner's offices and eight county governments: Ci County, Wu'an County, Neihuang County, Daming County, Handan County, Cheng'an County, and Anyang County. There are also the imposing and murderous Party officials from the eight counties.

    According to the Kuomintang's new administrative divisions, Anyang County has a total of twenty-eight townships, but they only control nine. The people in these nine townships, accounting for one-third of the county, are now teetering on the brink of death under layers of exploitation. According to the receipts of the former puppet county magistrate, Sun Ziqing, in January alone, 1,160,000 jin of wheat and twice as much firewood (over 8,000,000 jin) were requisitioned. In addition, there were labor levies and materials, such as 15,000 railway sleepers, each valued at over 10,000 yuan, totaling 150 million yuan. In reality, each sleeper was only given a price of 500 to 800 yuan, not even enough for transportation costs. From the Kuomintang takeover until early March, the amount requisitioned with receipts reached 60,000,000 yuan. The puppet troops, who had always oppressed the people, became even more rampant after receiving the so-called benevolence of the National Army. The notorious traitor Li Ying, with just over a thousand men, used three different names to collect salaries for three units of six thousand men. When his troops went to the countryside, the people had to "entertain" them, adding 40% to the overall cost of each village. Every time he moved his defense, he bought new pots. Anyang City alone was forced to contribute over 3,000,000 yuan. Soldiers could use slips to demand anything they wanted from the baojia chiefs. They could also take prostitutes to bathe, creating a chaotic mess. The cadres under the traitorous local emperor Wang Ziquan used various pretexts to seize land from the people. While the people's blood dried up, they became fat. Many now own one or two qing of land. Are other armies any better? As far as I know, the only difference is that they pay lip service to propriety, righteousness, and integrity, but in practice, they are generally the same.

    "The common people can't survive!" Such resentful voices echo from every village. People can barely eat one bowl of thin congee a day, at most two. Over a thousand people have already starved to death in one village. But those who have not died must tighten their belts and join the anti-communist organizations—the Militia, the National Defense Corps—receive special training, and be issued five major "certificates": Citizen Certificate, Pass, Residence Permit, Vendor's License, and Beggar's Certificate. The Citizen Certificate is exactly the same as the "Good Citizen Certificate" used by the enemy to rule the Chinese people, except for the addition of a "Blue Sky with a White Sun" emblem.

    Let's take a look at the lives of the high-ranking officials who exploit the people's wealth!

    The "receiving" heroes who descended from the sky and the "patriotic fighters" who emerged from the shadows, after the Japanese surrendered, all crossed the sea like the Eight Immortals, each displaying their unique skills. "What's yours is mine too," they grabbed everywhere, fighting for houses, cars, sofas, sneaking out the back door after sealing the front, closing the big door but opening the small door. The houses sealed by the county government were quietly unsealed by the special commissioner's office at night. Then, the army tore off the seals of the special commissioner's office. The officers were busy making American-style wool uniforms, each costing 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, and hanging "V" for Victory badges on their chests, driving cars, speeding back and forth on the streets, how "glorious"! They are even better at socializing, with each banquet costing 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. At this grand feast, they toast either the general who "contributed to the war of resistance" or the "underground worker." Amidst the clinking of glasses and the exchange of toasts, how joyous! After the drinks and tea, they play four rounds of "mahjong," winning or losing tens of thousands of yuan each time. Can the sound of the people's hunger awaken their "humanity" here?

    Before the war, Anyang was a cultural city in northern Henan, with eight high schools and middle schools, and over 3,000 students. After the Kuomintang takeover, Anyang Provincial High School and the Provincial Middle School also moved back, but the total number of students is only over two hundred. Private schools charge two to three million yuan in tuition and miscellaneous fees per student, leaving poor children to only sigh at the school's door! This has created the following phenomenon: on one hand, students who have dropped out of school wander the streets; on the other hand, schools are empty. Five elementary schools were taken over, with forty-eight classes, totaling over 1,700 students, some of whom are still studying the New People's textbooks left by the enemy!

    The schools are controlled by party thugs. The principal of Henan Provincial Second High School is Yang Zhendong, a CC clique member. The director of moral education is Wu Peilin, a Fuxing clique member. The principal of Zhangde Middle School is Huang Boying, the head of the Anyang Sanqing Tuan.... The Sanqing Tuan is active in various schools, forcing students to join. Those who don't join are suspected of being communist bandits. Under these circumstances, two-thirds of the students at Zhangde Middle School have been "partified," and a quarter of the students at the provincial high school have been "partified"... In reality, students no longer have the freedom to study.

    The people of Anyang say: After the National Army took over, it is not even as good as the "enemy and puppet era"! What else can I say?! (May 10th)

### “几家欢乐几家愁”  安阳杂记

　　“几家欢乐几家愁”
    安阳杂记
      “一城官，半城民，老百姓来不算人。
      想中央，盼中央，中央来了民遭殃。”
    在安阳城内流行于街头巷尾的这个民谣，就是该城一幅很好的画像罢。
    安阳街上到处是兵，到处是官。兵，至今穿着棉衣，官，穿着“呢子”。据说这里国民党正规军有四万多，收编的伪军李英、王自全还不在内。文官呢？有三个专员公署，有磁县、武安、内黄、大名、邯郸、成安、安阳等八个县政府。还有威气凛凛、杀气腾腾的八个县的党官。
    安阳全县，按国民党新的行政区划，共有二十八个乡镇，在他们手里的只有九个。这占三分之一的九个乡镇人民，在层层叠叠的压榨下，现已滚出死亡线上了。据前任汉奸县长孙子青的有收据的给养统计，单就今年元月份说，麦子即征到一百一十六万斤，柴草加倍，八百余万斤。此外还有工征料，如铁道枕木共征一万五千根，每根售价万余元，便是一万万五千元，而实际每根只给价五百到八百元不等，连运费也不够。自国民党接收后至三月初有条据征用的款额，已达六十万万。一贯压迫老百姓的伪军，在得到所谓国军博爱之后更加猖狂了。著名的铁头汉奸李英，不过一千余人，假借三个名义，领取三份六千人的薪饷。他的部队下了乡，还得要人民“招待”，每村招待费用，又增加到全村费用百分之四十。他移防一次，买锅一次，安阳城关仅摊派费用在三百万元以上。士兵拿着路条，可以到保甲长那里随便要东西，又可以带着妓女去洗澡，闹得乌烟瘴气。汉奸土皇帝王自全部下的干部，以各种名义吞并老百姓的土地，老百姓的血液干痼了，他们都肥胖起来，现有一两顷地的很多。别的军队好不好呢？据我所知，所不同的，仅仅是他们口头上好讲什礼义廉耻，实际行动，大体都差不多。
    “当老百姓的不能活下去了！”各个村发出了这样的怨恨声。老百姓差不多每天只能吃到一顿稀饭，至多两碗，一个村庄中已饿死一千多人了。可是不死的还得束紧腰带，叫你参加反共组织——壮丁队，国民兵团，受特务训练，还发给五大“证”，什么公民证，通行证，迁居证，小贩营业证，乞丐证。公民证和敌人统治中国人的“良民证”一模一样，不过上边加了一个“青天白日”。
    要瞧瞧敲诈民脂民膏的达官贵人的生活吧！
    天上飞来的“接收”英雄，剩下钻出来的“爱国志士”，日寇投降后，都在八仙过海，各显身手，“你的也是我的”，到处乱抓，争房子，争汽车，争沙发，前门封而后门跑，大门关而小门开。县政府封锁的房子，专署夜里把封条悄悄的撕了，一会儿，军队又把专署的封条又撕了。军官都在忙着做美式的呢子军服，每身十五六万元，胸前再挂上“Ｖ”字的胜利证章，坐着汽车，在街上鸣鸣的驶来驶去，多么“光荣”啊！他们更善于酬酢，每桌席二三十万元，在这个盛宴上不是为这个“抗战有功”的将军干杯，就是为那个“地下工作者干杯”，觥筹交错，乐何如之！酒后茶余，再来四圈“马将”，输赢辄又是几十万。在这里人民的饥饿声，还能喊醒他们的“人性吗”？
    安阳在战前是豫北的文化城，高初中有八个，学生有三千多人。自国民党接收后，省立安阳高中，和省立初中也跟着迁回来，但学生总共不过廿百多人。私立学校每个学生要缴学杂费两三万元，贫苦子弟，只有望校兴叹！因而造成这样现象：一面是失学的学生徘徊街头，一面是学校空空如也。小学共接收了五个，四十八班，共一千七百多人，有的还在念着敌人留下的新民课本！
    学校被党棍子把持着。河南省立第二高中，校长是ＣＣ分子杨振东，训育主任是复兴分子吴佩林，彰德中学校长黄伯英，他是安阳三青团的负责人，……。三青团在各个学校里大肆活动，强迫学生参加，不参加，就有奸匪嫌疑。在这种情形下，彰德中学三分之二的学生“党化”了，省立高中四分之一“党化”了……实际学生已没有读书的自由了。
    安阳老百姓说：国军接收后，连“敌伪时代”也不如了！这我还有什么话可说呢？！（五月十日）
