　　He Siyuan Plots to Attack Liberated Areas
    Secretly Transports Supplies to Puppet Troops in Liaocheng
    A Large Batch of Anti-Communist Documents Confiscated by Us
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 11th] On the evening of the 3rd, over ten trucks carrying large quantities of supplies drove from Jinan, passing through the Eighth Route Army's station in Liaocheng, intending to enter Liaocheng city. Among them were more than ten members of the Jinan Executive Headquarters and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Because the transportation of these supplies had neither been notified in advance nor had any letters of proof, the Eighth Route Army there immediately conducted an inspection according to law, as they attempted to transport them into Liaocheng, which was occupied by puppet troops. A handwritten letter from He Siyuan to the puppet troops in the city, along with twenty-five other anti-communist documents, and 20 million 法币 (legal tender) attached for the support of the puppet troops, were discovered. In his letter, He encouraged the puppet troops to hold fast and wait for an opportunity, and guaranteed to transport ammunition and supplies by plane. He also stated: "The Shandong Military Region" has been arranged and will attack Linqing from Gaotang, as well as Liaocheng. The Eighth Route Army authorities questioned Mr. Hawkins, the American representative of the Executive Headquarters, Gu Zili, the Kuomintang representative, and John, the representative of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. They claimed that these documents had nothing to do with them and apologized on the spot. The three parties then discussed the matter in detail and reached the following agreement: (1) The illegally seized documents will be kept by the Communist Party, and the Executive Headquarters will investigate their origin and severely punish the carriers. (2) From the seized documents, it is proved that He Siyuan prepared to transport bullets by plane to support the puppet troops in the city. All parties believe that this is an act of sabotaging the ceasefire agreement. The CCP will not be responsible for any unexpected events caused by this in the future. The seized 20 million 法币 was proved by illegal documents to be used by He Siyuan to support the puppet troops, and should be confiscated. After consultation, all parties agreed to use the money to provide relief to refugees inside and outside the city, but because the puppet troops in the city did not allow residents to leave the city to receive it, the money will be handed over to the organized relief committee for safekeeping for future disposal.

　　何思源图谋进攻解放区
    密运物资予聊城伪军
    大批反共文件一并为我查获
    【新华社荷泽十一日电】三日晚有汽车十余辆，载运大批物资，由济南驶经聊城八路军驻地，拟开入聊城城内，内有济南执行小组及救济总署人员十余人，该地八路军以运输是项物资，事先既未得到通知，又无任何证明函件，竟欲运入伪军盘据之聊城，当即依法予以检查，查得何思源致该城伪军的亲笔信一件，及其他反共文件二十五件，并附接济伪军之法币二千万元。何氏在其信中，鼓励伪军坚守待机，并保证以飞机运送弹药及物资。又称：“山东军区”已布置就绪，将由高唐进攻临清，聊城云云。八路军当局向执行小组美代表郝金斯、国民党代表顾自立、救济总署代表纳约翰，提出质询，彼等声称此种文件与他们无关，并当面道歉，三方旋将此事详细商谈，取得如下协议：（１）查获之非法文件，由中共方面保存，由小组追究其来源，予携带者以严重处分。（２）从查获文件中，证明何思源准备以飞机运送子弹支援城内伪军，各方认为此系破坏停战协议之举，今后如因此引起意外事件，中共概不负责。查获之法币二千万元，从非法文件中证明系何思源接济伪军之用，理应予以以没收，现经各方协议，将该款救济城内外难民，但由于城内伪军不放居民出城领取，该款将交所组织之救济委员会收存，以备将来处理。
