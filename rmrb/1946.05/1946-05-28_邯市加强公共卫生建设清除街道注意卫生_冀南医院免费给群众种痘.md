　　[This City News] Under the trampling of the enemy and puppets for seven or eight years, the majority of residents in Handan City lived a life of hunger, cold, and suffering, threatened by disease and death. There was no talk of medical and health construction at all. Countless citizens died from infectious diseases. After the liberation of Handan, the municipal government immediately paid attention to the construction of public health, rectified the city appearance, and gradually cleaned up the dirty streets and scattered garbage and rotten bones everywhere. After the Border Region Health Bureau stationed in Handan in March, it cooperated with the municipal government to carry out a disease prevention campaign, and health construction was further improved. Currently, 223 water tanks and 69 garbage bins have been established on both sides of the streets. All the underground drains on both sides of the road have been repaired, and all the accumulated manure and soil for many years have been transported out. In addition, walls have been built around the wells, the wellheads have been covered, and public water fetching buckets have been set up. During the enemy's occupation, the city moat was filled with coal cinder and manure. Now, there are plans to repair it and introduce water from the Danying River. Other public places such as markets, restaurants, and bathhouses have established sanitary conventions, sweeping the streets and inspecting hygiene every day. The streets and roads have also been repaired. The city appearance of Handan is gradually becoming cleaner.

　　[This Newspaper Weixian News] The publicly operated Jinnan Hospital, established in Weixian County, has achieved good results since its establishment half a year ago, thanks to the active efforts of all doctors and nurses. Many people seek medical treatment, and more than 150 impoverished people have been hospitalized and recuperated for free. The hospital also organized a team to go to the countryside to provide free vaccinations. Hezhao Town, 30 li from Weixian County, specially invited the team to administer vaccinations. In one day, more than 300 people were vaccinated. Many other villages have also been vaccinated. According to statistics, a total of 3,030 people were vaccinated, including 400 adults and 2,627 children.
