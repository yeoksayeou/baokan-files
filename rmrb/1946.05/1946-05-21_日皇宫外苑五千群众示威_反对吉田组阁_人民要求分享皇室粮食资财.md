　　Five Thousand People Demonstrate Outside the Japanese Imperial Palace
    Opposing Yoshida's Cabinet Formation
    People Demand to Share Imperial Household Grain and Assets
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an Eighteenth Dispatch] Tokyo dispatch: After the news of Yoshida's being ordered to form a cabinet was released, democratic parties and progressive individuals in Tokyo voiced their opposition one after another. Yesterday, five thousand people held a demonstration outside the Imperial Palace. The demonstrating masses proceeded in an orderly fashion to the outside of the Imperial Palace gate, demanding to see the Japanese Emperor. A delegation of twenty-five people requested the Emperor to dismiss Yoshida and share the Imperial household's grain and assets with the people. At another location outside the Imperial Palace, representatives of the Japan National Printing Workers' Union put forward the same demands, vowing to back them up with a general strike to stop printing Japanese Yen banknotes if their demands were not met. Meanwhile, while Yoshida was holding a secret meeting to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet, thousands of Japanese people, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, gathered outside Yoshida's residence, denouncing Yoshida as a reactionary and shouting slogans protesting Yoshida's appointment as Prime Minister. Eleven demonstrators rushed into Yoshida's official residence, delivered a letter of protest, and demanded to meet with Shidehara and Yoshida, but were refused. The Japanese Communist Party has decided to hold a large demonstration of 200,000 people towards the Imperial Palace on the 19th, again protesting Yoshida's appointment as Prime Minister, and will expose more than fifty hidden grain storage locations in Tokyo. The Japanese police expressed deep concern about this. The Socialist Party has refused Yoshida's invitation to participate in the new cabinet. Socialist Party spokesperson Chotaro Mizutani (center-left) stated: Yoshida's cabinet is the illegitimate child of the soon-to-be-defunct Prime Minister Shidehara and Cabinet Secretary General Wataru Kusumoto. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun criticized Yoshida's cabinet as the successor to the Shidehara cabinet, which is purely composed of reactionary bureaucrats, and is another line of defense for the bureaucrats who are about to step down. Yomiuri Hochi revealed that some members of the Progressive Party deeply feel that many old-school members are still maintaining their original positions in the new cabinet. Dissatisfied with the policies of the party's new president, Shidehara, they will leave the party.

    【新华社延安十八日电】东京讯：吉田奉命组阁的消息传出后，东京民主党派进步人士舆论均纷起反对，昨日有五千群众在皇宫外苑举行示威，示威群众有秩序的进至皇宫门外，要求进见日皇，由二十五人组织的代表团，要求日皇将吉田免职，并将皇室粮食资财与人民分享，皇宫外苑的另一地点，日本全国印刷工会的代表提出相同的要求，如不能达到目的，誓以总罢工停止印刷日元纸钞为后盾。同时在吉田正召开秘密会议会商组阁问题时，有成千日人在日共领导下，群起集吉田门外，斥责吉田为反动派，并高呼抗议吉田出任首相。示威者十一人冲进吉田官邸，递交抗议书，要求会见币原和吉田，但被拒绝。日共决于十九日举行二十万人向皇宫的大示威，再度抗议吉田出任首相，并将揭发东京五十余处藏有粮食。日警方对此，深表忧虑，社会党已拒绝吉田邀请参加新内阁，社会党发言人水谷长太郎（中派偏左）称：吉田内阁系行将下野的币原首相及内阁书记长楠本渡之私生子。朝日新闻社论，抨击吉田内阁是由纯为反动官僚组成之币原内阁之后身，是行将下野官僚的另一防线。读卖报知则揭露进步党中若干分子，深感新内阁中很多旧派分子仍保持原有职位，他们因不满该党新总裁币原所持之政策，将脱离该党。
