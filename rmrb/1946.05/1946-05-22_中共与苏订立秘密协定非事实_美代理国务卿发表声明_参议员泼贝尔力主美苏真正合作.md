　　The CCP Did Not Sign a Secret Agreement with the Soviets
    Acting U.S. Secretary of State Issues Statement
    Senator Pepper Advocates Genuine U.S.-Soviet Cooperation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] According to the U.S. Information Service in Washington, D.C.: Acting U.S. Secretary of State Acheson stated on the 17th, in response to reporters, that the State Department has no knowledge of rumors that the Soviet Union and the CCP signed a secret agreement last December that included a ten-point program. Furthermore, the State Department has not obtained sufficient intelligence to prove that Soviet troops and CCP troops are jointly fighting against the Chinese Nationalist Army. It is reported that the Hearst-owned International News Service, a reactionary faction in the United States, broadcast a provocative anti-Soviet and anti-Communist message on the 14th, stating: "The Soviet Union and the CCP signed a secret agreement with a ten-point plan, stipulating that the Soviet army would help the Chinese Red Army occupy Manchuria, and stipulating that the CCP's Eighth Route Army would obey the Soviet Union," etc. Acheson's above statement proves that the International News Service's dispatch is an unfounded rumor.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] New York Dispatch: Democratic Senator Pepper, at a mass meeting in New York, severely criticized U.S. foreign policy, calling on Britain and the United States not to engage in anti-Soviet activities and to achieve genuine cooperation with the Soviet Union. Pepper indicated that if ruptures continue to occur in international politics, this will lead to a new war.

　　中共与苏订立秘密协定非事实
    美代理国务卿发表声明
    参议员泼贝尔力主美苏真正合作
    【新华社延安十九日电】据美新闻处华府讯：美代理国务卿亚泽森，十七日答记者称：对于外传苏联曾与中共于去年十二月签订包括十大纲领之秘密协定一节，国务院并无所闻。至于苏军与中共军共同对抗中国国军，国务院亦未获有充分之情报可资证明。按美国反动派之赫斯特系国际新闻社，十四日曾播发一反苏反共之挑拨性消息称：“苏联与中共曾签订一包括十要点之计划的秘密协定，规定苏军帮助中国红军占据满洲，并规定中共八路军将听命于苏联”等，亚氏上述声明，证明国际新闻社的电讯是无稽谣言。
    【新华社延安十九日电】纽约讯，民主党参议员泼贝尔在纽约群众大会上，严厉批评美国的对外政策，呼吁英美不要进行反苏，应与苏联达到真正的合作。泼贝尔指示国际政治方面如果继续发生破裂，这将走向新的战争。
