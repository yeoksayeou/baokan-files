　　[Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 15th] The Eighth Route Army in Central Hebei, responding to the urgent request of hundreds of thousands of people in Cangxian, Jiaohe, Nanpi, Dongguang, and other counties, liberated Botou Town, a key area with a population of 60,000 on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, on the 10th. The brutal puppet army leader Xu Chunlin and his troops were routed, and order has been restored in Botou. It is reported that after the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Team arrived in Botou Town, they consulted with the Bohai Military Region and the Eighth Sub-district of Central Hebei. In order to resolutely implement the ceasefire order, the Eighth Route Army made concessions and signed an agreement with Xu Chunlin. The Eighth Route Army retreated three *li* from its original positions, and the existing fortifications were also demolished. However, the puppet troops in Botou instead built more fortifications and harassed the area daily, brutally killing dozens of local cadres of the democratic government, including Wu Yuquan, Wu Yuezhang, and Wang Fengyi. Recently, there was an incident of beating representatives of the Executive Headquarters and encircling and annihilating the Jiaohe security team. The Eighth Route Army in the area repeatedly lodged protests with the Kuomintang representatives, but they were ignored. Xu Chunlin even shot and killed most of the captured Eighth Route Army personnel and threw their bodies into the canal. The bodies recovered by local cadres included more than 60 people, including the Deputy Political Commissar of the Jiaohe Security Team. When the puppet troops launched a second attack on the Sanlizhuang Security Brigade, Communist representative Fu Jize and American representative Warner wanted to inspect the situation, but the puppet troops prevented them from leaving the city. When the two representatives walked along South Main Street, they were severely insulted by many puppet army hooligans, who threw clods of earth and bricks at Colonel Fu Jize. Lieutenant Colonel Warner was extremely angry and drew his pistol, saying, "Whoever throws bricks again will be shot!" The group of villains then fled in panic. That night, Lieutenant Colonel Warner telegraphed the Beiping Executive Headquarters, stating that the puppet troops in Botou Town had no sincerity in the negotiated agreement and that there were many complaints from the masses, demanding severe punishment. Warner angrily told the Communist Colonel Fu, "Gather your forces and destroy them." At the same time, the Eighth Route Army received hundreds of petitions from the people accusing the traitors in Botou of their crimes and demanding the disbandment of the puppet army. The Eighth Route Army was compelled to act in self-defense. From May 3rd, fierce fighting broke out with the puppet troops, which ended on the 10th. In total, Botou Town and seven puppet army strongholds in its vicinity, including Fengjiakou, were liberated, more than 100 puppet troops were killed, and more than 1,000 puppet Dongguang security captains, including Li Wencheng, were captured.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th] Today, this agency summarizes military news: (1) In Guangdong, the Kuomintang authorities violated the Guangdong Agreement of April 12th. Their three security regiments, commanded by Wei Zhanfu, Deputy Director of the Security Bureau, began attacking the Dongjiang area. (2) In the Su-Wan area, west of the Jinpu Railway in Huainan, the Kuomintang army under Xia Wei began to divide its forces and invade the Fourth Sub-district of Su-Wan on the 12th. Our army rose up in self-defense and is fiercely battling southwest and northwest of Dingyuan. (3) In Shandong, Wang Yaowu, Director of the Second Pacification Zone of the Kuomintang, held a secret military meeting in Xuzhou last month to deploy an attack on the Shandong Liberated Area. Currently, war has broken out in two locations, south of Jinan and near Zaozhuang. Over 3,000 troops from its 12th and 96th Armies began attacking the Licheng Liberated Area on the 11th and have occupied 24 villages and towns more than 30 *li* south of Jinan. In addition, in the Central Plains area, troops from the Kuomintang 18th Army are still invading the area south of Hanchuan.

    淮南我军奋起自卫激战定远西北
    【新华社河间十五日电】冀中八路军顺应沧县、交河、南皮、东光等县数十万人民的紧急申请，于十日解放了六万人口的津浦路北段要地泊头镇，残暴的伪军头子徐春林及其所部溃灭，泊头秩序已告安定。按自军调部执行小组抵泊镇后，曾与八路军渤海分区及冀中八分区商谈，该地八路军为坚决执行停战命令，委曲求全，与徐春林订立协定，八路军从原阵地向后撤退三里，原有工事亦随之拆毁，泊镇伪军反而加筑工事，每日出扰，先后惨杀民主政府地方干部吴玉泉、吴越章、王凤义等数十人，近突发生殴打执行小组代表及围歼交河保安队事件。该地八路军曾数次向国民党代表提出交涉，均被置之不理，而徐春林竟将俘去之八路军人员大部枪杀，投入运河，经地方干部打捞上岸的尸体，有交河保安队副政委等六十余人。当该伪军二次向三里庄保安大队进犯时，中共代表傅继泽，美方代表华纳欲往视察，该伪竟阻止出城，当两代表顺南大街行走时，竟遭伪军流氓多人大肆辱骂，并以土块砖头向傅继泽上校投掷，华纳中校气愤已极，乃拔手枪谓：“谁再抛砖枪毙谁”，群丑方仓惶逃避。是夜，华纳中校即电告北平执行部，说明泊镇伪军对商谈协议毫无诚意，并有群众控诉多起，要求严惩。华纳并气愤地对中共傅上校说：“集结你们的兵力，消灭它”。同时八路军收到人民控诉泊镇汉奸罪行，要求解散伪军之呈状达数百件。八路军迫不得已，实行自卫。五月三日起乃与伪军发生激战，至十日始告结束。计解放泊头镇及其附近之冯家口等伪军据点七处，击毙伪军一百余名，俘伪东光保安队长李文成等一千余名。
    【新华社延安十五日电】今日本社综合军息：（一）广东方面，国民党当局违反四月十二日广东协议，其三个保安团由保安局副局长魏占孚指挥，开始进攻东江地区。（二）苏皖方面，在淮南津浦路西，国民党军夏威部，十二日开始分兵进犯苏皖四分区，我军奋起自卫，正激战于定远西南、西北一带。（三）山东方面，国民党第二绥靖区主任王耀武，于上月在徐州开秘密军事会议，部署进攻山东解放区后，目前在济南以南与枣庄附近两处，已开始发生战争。其十二军及九十六军所部三千余人，十一日起进攻历城解放区，已侵占济南以南三十余里村镇二十四处。此外在中原方面，国民党十八军所部仍进犯汉川以南一带。
