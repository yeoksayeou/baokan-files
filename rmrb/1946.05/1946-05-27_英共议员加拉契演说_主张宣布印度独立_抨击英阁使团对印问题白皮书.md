　　British Communist MP Gallacher's Speech
    Advocates Declaring India's Independence
    Criticizes British Cabinet Mission's White Paper on the Indian Question
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] According to a Reuters report from London: When the British House of Commons discussed the British Cabinet Mission's White Paper on the Indian Question, British Communist MP Gallacher delivered a speech. He first discussed what situation British rule had created in India since its inception. He denied the Liberal MP Davies's claim that Britain had a glorious historical record in India. He said: "There are 400 million people there, with all kinds of good mineral resources, but when the war broke out in 1939, India could not even manufacture tanks, and now famine is growing there again. Britain has not moved India forward; it has kept it in a low state of backwardness." Gallacher then spoke about the background of the British Cabinet Mission's publication of the White Paper. He said: "We are faced with the fact that the old-style government has completely gone bankrupt, and India is in the midst of revolutionary ferment," therefore, "when the Cabinet Mission went to India and the British Prime Minister said something about Indian independence, even the imperialist MPs sitting over there applauded." Gallacher then criticized the White Paper itself, saying: "We see that someone is making detailed plans to help divide India, rather than unite it, and to win over the bourgeoisie to oppose the masses of the people." Gallacher opposed this policy of division, and then suggested immediately relieving the famine in India, declaring India's independence, withdrawing troops on a regular basis, and then negotiating with India on a truly equal basis, allowing the Indians to establish their own government, manage their own affairs, and abolish the princely states. He said: "If you do this, you can get the great goodwill of the Indian people, and the Indian people will not oppose automatically uniting with us."

　　英共议员加拉契演说
    主张宣布印度独立
    抨击英阁使团对印问题白皮书
    【新华社延安二十四日电】据路透社伦敦讯：英下院讨论英阁使团对印问题的白皮书时，英共议员加拉契发表演说。他首先谈到英国统治印度以来使印度造成了什么形势，他否认自由党议员戴维斯所称英国对印度有光荣的历史成绩。他说：“那儿有四万万人口，有一切良好的矿物资源，然而在一九三九年战争爆发时，印度还不能制造坦克，而现在那里又增长着饥荒，英国没有使印度前进，她保持着低度的落后。”加拉契继谈到英阁使团发表白皮书的背景，他说：“我们面临这样的事实，即旧式的政府已完全破产，印度是处于革命的酝酿中”，因而“当内阁使团赴印、英相说了一些印度独立的话时，甚至坐在那边的帝国主义者议员们，也拍手起来。”加拉契继批评白皮书本身说：“我们看到有人正在作周密的计划，以帮助印度的分裂，而不是团结，并笼络资产阶级去反对人民群众。”加拉契反对这种分裂政策，继建议立即救济印度饥荒，宣布印度独立，定期撤兵，然后在真正平等基础上，与印度进行谈判，允许印度人成立自己的政府，管理自己的事情，废除藩邦王公。他说：“如果你这样做，你就可以得到印度人民的极大好意，而且印度人民也不会反对自动与我们联合了。”
