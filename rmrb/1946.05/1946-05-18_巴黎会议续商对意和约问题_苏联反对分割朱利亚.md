　　Paris Conference Continues Discussion on the Italian Peace Treaty
    Soviet Union Opposes Partitioning of Julian March
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th] Paris Dispatch: After Bevin returned to Paris (Note: Bevin briefly returned to London on the afternoon of the 12th), the four foreign ministers held another four-hour secret meeting on the afternoon of the 13th to discuss issues related to the Italian peace treaty. According to a United Press report, regarding the Italian border issue, Britain and the United States expressed their agreement with France's border demarcation proposal (which would return most of the Julian March to Yugoslavia, but Trieste would still belong to Italy). The Soviet Union believes that this proposal constitutes an unreasonable artificial division of the Julian March from its economic center, and therefore refused to agree. No results have yet been achieved on the issue of reparations. Bevin also opposed Bidault's proposal for the four powers to control Italian colonies. Since there was no complete agreement on the peace treaty issue, Molotov rejected Bidault's suggestion to change the agenda and discuss Germany. Bidault also requested an early date for the peace conference and amendments to the armistice terms. Molotov stated that he did not object in principle, but this must be discussed after agreements are reached on the major peace treaty issues.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Paris Dispatch: At the four foreign ministers' meeting on the afternoon of the 11th, the Italian colonial issue continued to be discussed. The Soviet Union, not hesitating to compromise, continued to make significant concessions, making the foreign ministers' meeting more coordinated than before. According to Reuters, Molotov proposed at the meeting that the Soviet Union abandon its demand for trusteeship of Tripolitania (western Libya) and advocate that Italy be responsible for the trusteeship of its original colonies under the supervision of the United Nations. Bevin has agreed to this, but on the condition that Cyrenaica (eastern Libya) be placed under British trusteeship. United Press reports that the four foreign ministers are now attempting to amend the compromise reached on the 6th to make it a general agreement on the Italian issue.

　　巴黎会议续商对意和约问题
    苏联反对分割朱利亚
    【新华社延安十五日电】巴黎讯：贝文回返巴黎后（按贝文十二日下午一度返伦敦），四强外长十三日下午又举行四小时秘密会议，讨论对意和约诸问题。据合众社电称：关于意边界问题，英美表示同意法国之划界建议（该建议将朱利亚大部地区归还南国，但的里雅斯特则仍属于意国）。苏联认为此建议系对朱利亚与其经济中心实行不合理的人工分割，因此拒绝苟同。关于赔款问题，仍未获结果。贝纳斯关于由四强管制意大利殖民地之建议，也遭到贝文的反对。由于和约问题尚无完全协议，莫洛托夫否决贝纳斯改变议题讨论德国的建议。贝纳斯又要求速定和会日期及修改休战条款，莫洛托夫表示原则上不反对，但必须于各主要和约问题取得协议之后再说。
    【新华社延安十三日电】巴黎讯：四强外长十一日下午的会议上，继续讨论意大利殖民地问题，苏联不惜委曲求全，续作重大让步，使外长会议比前具有较大协调趋势。据路透社称：莫洛托夫在会上提出，苏联放弃其托管的黎波里坦尼亚（利比亚西部）的要求，并主张在联合国监督下，由意大利负责托管其原有殖民地。贝文对此已同意，但以将昔兰尼加（利比亚东部）由英国托管为条件。合众社称：四外长现正企图修改六日获得之妥协，使其变成对意大利问题之总协议。
