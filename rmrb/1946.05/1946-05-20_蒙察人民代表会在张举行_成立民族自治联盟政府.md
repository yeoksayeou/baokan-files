　　Mongolian and Chahar people of Inner Mongolia and Chahar recently convened a People's Representatives Congress in Zhangjiakou, establishing a local ethnic autonomous league government directly under the leadership of the Chahar Provincial Government. Starting from March 10th, after the meetings of people of all ethnic groups, the Chahar League People's Representative Congress was formed. Subsequently, Sabule gave a report on the establishment of branch meetings of various banners and the banner governments. After reading the letter from Inner Mongolian people's leader Yun Ze to the congress, representatives enthusiastically took the stage to speak. On the second and third days of the congress, proposals on local autonomy, finance, economy, culture and education, government work, and freedom of migration were hotly discussed. Through bottom-up general elections, democratic governments of various banners were produced by secret ballot, and eleven representatives (two female representatives) were elected. When the Chahar Mongolian People's Representatives Congress grandly opened in Zhangjiakou, Presidium member Suo Tena Mu Que Wei delivered a speech stating: "For more than thirty years, the people of the Chahar League have suffered greatly under the oppression of Han chauvinism and feudal rule. Fortunately, the Eighth Route Army and the Outer Mongolian Army's heroic resistance against Japan allowed democracy and freedom to appear for the first time on the entire Mongolian land. This is the result of the help of the Chinese Communist Party and the efforts of the Inner Mongolian people." During the meeting, representatives from various banners put forward proposals such as developing production, rewarding hunting, and promoting model livestock breeders, all of which were unanimously approved by the congress. On the fourth and fifth days, elections were held, and Chen Guangyu, Su Jian×, Suo Tela Mu Tai Er, Ha Si Wa Qi Lu, Se Bo Ke Tong Bu, Luo Sheng, Yi Da Zhu Bu and others were elected as nine members of the Chahar League Government.
