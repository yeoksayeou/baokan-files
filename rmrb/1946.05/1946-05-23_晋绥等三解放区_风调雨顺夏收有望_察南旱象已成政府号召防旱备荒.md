　　Jin-Sui and Other Three Liberated Areas
    Favorable Weather Promises Good Summer Harvest
    Southern Chahar Faces Drought, Government Calls for Drought Prevention and Famine Relief
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th Dispatch] According to reports from our Jin-Sui, Jin-Cha-Ji, and Shandong branch offices, most areas in the three liberated areas have experienced ample rainfall since the beginning of spring, with favorable weather conditions, promising a good summer harvest this year. In the plains areas of Wenshui, Fenyang, and Pingyao in the Jin-Sui Border Region, wheat seedlings are thriving, a phenomenon unseen in nearly twenty years. Spring wheat in Xingxian, Linxian, and other places is also the best in over a decade. In the main cotton-growing areas of Lüliang and other places, most of the cotton had been sown before Grain Rain (a traditional Chinese solar term). Wheat seedlings in Shandong are also flourishing, with favorable rainfall in the Linyi area on the 6th. In the Bohai region, the 10 million mu of wheat fields, accounting for half of the cultivated land, are expected to yield a bumper harvest, and most autumn crops have also sprouted. Rainfall has also been abundant in various parts of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. In the Ji-Zhong and Ji-Dong areas, wheat seedlings have already grown over two chi in height and are about to head and fill. According to estimates by experienced farmers, if there are no unexpected events, each mu of wheat can yield seven dou to one shi, potentially reaching 80% to 90% of a normal year's harvest. In the Ji-Xi areas, successive heavy rains fell on the 16th and 28th of last month, and the masses are carrying out intensive sowing. However, a drought has formed in southern Chahar Province, and the provincial government has called on the people to carry out drought prevention and famine relief.

　　晋绥等三解放区
    风调雨顺夏收有望
    察南旱象已成政府号召防旱备荒
    【新华社延安十九日电】据本社晋绥、晋察冀、山东分社来电，三个解放区各地，入春以来，大部普降甘霖，风调雨顺，今年夏收有望。晋绥边区的文水、汾阳、平遥等平川一带，麦苗茂盛，为近二十年来所未有，兴县、临县等地春麦，亦为十余年来所罕见。主要种棉区吕梁等地，在谷雨前棉花已大部下种。山东麦苗亦盛，临沂一带，六日喜雨。渤海区占耕地半数的一千万亩麦田，可望丰收，秋田大部亦已出苗。晋察冀边区各地，雨水亦盛。冀中、冀东区麦苗，已长高二尺余，即将抽穗灌浆。据老农估计：如无意外，每亩小麦可收七斗至一石，可得八九成年景。冀西各地于上月十六日及二十八日数日，相继下了透雨，群众正突击播种。惟察哈尔省之察南，旱象已成，该省政府已号召人民进行防旱备荒。
