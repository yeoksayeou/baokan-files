　　Paris Foreign Ministers Conference

　　The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference, which opened in Paris on April 25th and lasted for three weeks, adjourned on May 16th and decided to reconvene on June 15th to continue consultations on outstanding issues. The purpose of this Foreign Ministers Conference was to expedite the drafting of peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, former satellites of Germany, in preparation for submission to the future 21-nation peace conference. After 26 plenary or secret meetings, preliminary and partial agreements were reached, including the preamble to the Italian peace treaty, the disposition of the Italian navy, the disposition of some islands in the Adriatic Sea, and parts of the treaties with Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. However, agreement was not reached on several issues. The sticking point of the conference was the following important issues in the Italian peace treaty:

　　First, the issue of reparations. The Soviet Union demanded $300 million in reparations, of which $100 million would go to the Soviet Union and $200 million would be distributed to Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania. Considering the losses suffered by these countries from the Axis member Italy in World War II, the Soviet demand was not large. However, the United States and Britain initially refused. After France's compromise, they recognized the reparation of $100 million to the Soviet Union, but raised objections to the source of the reparations. Byrnes confused relief and reparations responsibilities, saying that Italy was too poor and needed large amounts of American relief and aid. Second, on the issue of the disposition of Italian colonies, the Soviet Union made the most significant concessions. It finally abandoned its individual trusteeship claim over Tripolitania, agreed to France's proposal, and agreed in principle to Britain's plan to return the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, abandoning its demand to establish a base on the islands. Britain also partially accepted France's proposal in the end, but the United States preferred an international condominium policy, advocating that the four powers jointly administer the Italian colonies in North Africa for one year. If a final solution could not be found within this year, the area would be handed over to the United Nations for handling. This plan was rejected by Bevin. Third, the Trieste issue is generally considered to be the key issue in the Italian peace treaty and the most fiercely debated. The Soviet Union supported Yugoslavia's reasonable demand to merge the city, because the area should be returned to Yugoslavia in terms of history, economy, and politics. The United States and Britain insisted on separating the city from its historical and economic mother body, Venezia Giulia, and continuing to assign it to Italy. The US-UK plan not only encourages the Italian reactionaries to admit that their past plunder continues to be legal, and thereby "punishes the new democratic Yugoslavia," but also has "ulterior motives" (Molotov's words), which is to adhere to the Mediterranean balance of power policy, imprison the Soviet Union in the inland sea, and prevent it from entering the Mediterranean, because in their view, Yugoslavia is undoubtedly pro-Soviet. Second, and more importantly, if Trieste remains with Italy, the US-UK controlled Italy will undoubtedly use the area as a base for the US and Britain to penetrate the Balkans in the future. This is the secret behind the UK and US's consistent disregard for Yugoslavia's demands. This consistency between the US and the UK, and their inconsistency on the issue of Italian colonies in North Africa, exposes the fact that the United States supports Britain in excluding the Soviet Union from the Mediterranean, while at the same time trying to find more opportunities to extend its influence into the British Empire's sphere of influence. Fourth, on the issue of the form of control over Italy, Byrnes insisted on expanding the control power over Italy, enabling it to generally supervise the implementation of the treaty clauses. The expansion of the power of the Italian Control Commission means the expansion of the power of the US and UK, which further undermines Italy's sovereignty and prevents the growth of Italy's democratic forces. According to a Reuters report by Mr. King on May 1, the United States' plan also contained the attempt that if it was accepted, it could be used as a precedent for Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to expand its reach into the Balkans. The Soviet Union, of course, opposed this plan and insisted that Italy should be granted an independent and autonomous democratic position. Fifth, on the issue of the date of the peace conference, according to a United Press dispatch: Byrnes anticipated that "at least fifteen or sixteen countries at the 21-nation peace conference are almost certain to side with the Western countries. Therefore, he repeatedly requested that the unresolved issues at the conference be submitted to the peace conference for discussion." This proposal clearly violated the agreements of the Potsdam and Moscow conferences (i.e., the draft peace treaty submitted to the peace conference for approval must first obtain the unanimous consent of the four powers).

　　Looking at this Paris Conference, several points are worth noting: First, the main disputes in the conference occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the United States took different views on the Soviet Union on almost every important issue; Second, there were also differences between the United States and Britain, especially on the issue of Italian colonies. The Soviet Union made important concessions on this issue, mainly to Britain. Third, although this conference did not achieve major results, the atmosphere was eased and there was room for negotiation. From the above three points, this conference is different from the London Three Foreign Ministers Conference in September last year.

　　The third post-war Foreign Ministers Conference, although without major results, has adjourned temporarily, but no matter how many disputes and twists and turns there may be, the issues raised in the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference will eventually be resolved through compromise.

### 巴黎外长会议

　　巴黎外长会议
    四月二十五日，在巴黎召开的四强外长会议，历时三周，已于五月十六日宣告休会了，并决定于六月十五日再行召开，以便继续协商各项未决问题。这次外长会议的目的，是为了加速草就对德前附庸国意、罗、保、匈、芬等国的和约，以准备提交未来的二十一国和会会议，经过二十六次的全会或秘密会议之后，包括对意和约序言，对意海军之处置，亚得里亚海之一些岛屿的处置，对罗、匈、保、芬和约之部分问题等，已达到了初步的部份的原则的协定，但在若干问题上，仍未获得协议。会议僵持的焦点，是关于对意和约中如下的一些重要问题：
    第一，赔款问题，苏联要求三亿美元的赔偿，其中一亿归苏，二亿分配于南、希、与阿尔巴尼亚，由轴心成员意大利在二次世界大战中所给予上述国家的损失来说，苏联这个要求是不大的，但是美英初则拒绝，复经法国之折衷，承认予苏一亿美元之赔款，而关于赔款来源问题，又作异议，贝纳斯把救济与赔偿责任混为一谈，说意大利穷因不堪，需要美国大量之救济和援助。第二，苏联在意大利殖民地之处置这个问题上，作了最重大的让步，它最后放弃了对的黎波里坦尼亚的单独托管要求，而同意了法国的建议，并在原则上同意了英国将多得喀尼斯群岛归还希腊的计划，而放弃了它在该岛建立基地的要求。英国在最后也部分接受了法国的建议，但美国则宁愿国际共管政策，主张北非意殖民地由四强托管一年，如在此一年中不能求得最后解决办法，则将该地交给联合国处理，这个计划遭到贝文的拒绝。第三，的里雅斯特问题，一般认为这是对意和约的关键问题，而且是争论最烈的一个问题，苏联支持南斯拉夫合并的城的合理要求，因为该地不论从历史经济和政治各方面看，都应该归还给南国，而美英则坚持使的城与其历史的和经济的母体朱利亚区分割开来，仍然归属意国。美英的计划不仅是鼓励意国反动派承认其过去的掠夺继续合法，并以此“处罚新民主主义的南国”，而且还有“其不可告人的动机”（莫洛托夫语），这就是坚持地中海均势政策，囚禁苏联于内海，而使其无法进入地中海，因为在他们看来，南国无疑是亲苏的。其次，更重要的是如果的城保留给意国，在美英控制下的意国，无疑将以该地供作美英他日深入巴尔干的基地，这就是英美一致不顾一切，反对南国要求的秘密。美英这一点的一致，同他们在北非意殖民地问题上的不一致，暴露了一个事实，即美国支持英国排除苏联于地中海之外，同时则企图找寻更多的机会，将自己的势力伸进英帝国势力范围。第四，对意管制形式问题，贝纳斯坚持扩大对意的管制权力，使其能一般的监督和约条款的执行，意大利管制委员会权力的扩大，就是美英权力的扩大，就是更加损害意国的主权，和阻止意国民主力量的生长。据路透社记者金氏五月一日的报导，美国的上述计划，还包含这样的企图，即如其被接受，即可援例用之于罗、匈、保各国，以扩大其伸足巴尔干的机会。苏联当然反对这个计划，而坚持应予意国以独立自主的民主立场。第五，和会召开的日期问题，据合众社电讯称：贝纳斯预计到“二十一国和会上至少有十五六个国家几已确定附合西方诸国，因此，一再反复要求将会议上之未决问题，提交和会讨论”。这个提案，明显地破坏了波茨顿与莫斯科会议的协定（即提交和会批准之和约草案，必须首先取得四强一致之同意。）
    综观这次巴黎会议，有几点值得注意：第一，会议中主要争执是发生于美苏之间，几乎在每一个重要问题上，美方都对苏联采取不同的意见；第二，美英之间也有分歧，特别表现在意大利殖民地问题上。苏联在这个问题上，作了重要的让步，主要是对英让步。第三，这次会议虽无重大成就，但气氛缓和，留有余地。从以上三点看来，这次会议是和去年九月间伦敦三外长会议不同的。
    战后第三次的外长会议，虽无重大结果，而暂时休会了，但是不管经过多少争论和曲折，巴黎外长会议中所提出的问题，终究是要得到妥协的解决的。
