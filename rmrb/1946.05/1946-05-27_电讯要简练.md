　　Telegrams Should Be Concise
　　To all Xinhua News Agency General Branch Offices, Branch Offices, Sub-Branch Offices, and Special Correspondents:

　　Telegrams are an urgent tool for conveying social dynamics, and they represent the most streamlined form of news. They report the most important news with the most concise language and the highest speed. When writing telegrams, it is necessary not only to tighten sentences to save on telegram costs, but also to constantly maintain the idea: "For the fastest possible reporting."

　　However, our news telegrams, whether broadcast by the General Office or reported by the Branch Offices, often violate this principle, committing the faults of being lengthy and slow. As a result: First, there is a great waste of manpower and resources. The total number of words in telegrams from the Branch Offices in March was nearly 600,000, of which only 150,000 words, about a quarter, were adopted and broadcast by the General Office. The remaining three-quarters, or 450,000 words, were mostly wasted. These 450,000 words went through four hands from the Sub-Branch Offices to the Branch Offices, the General Branch Offices, and the General Office. Each transfer involved three procedures of editing, translating, and dispatching, totaling twelve procedures, wasting countless labor; and even the 150,000 words broadcast by the General Office were not necessarily all brilliant and usable. In fact, the amount adopted by various newspapers is at most 80%. Second, the abundance and length of稿[gǎo] often cause telegram congestion, inevitably leading to backlog phenomena, affecting the rapid dispatch of important稿[gǎo], and many news items often lose their timeliness as a result. Third, the enthusiasm for dumping quantity neglects the improvement of quality, hindering the rapid improvement of business technology. Fourth, and most importantly, although a lot of manpower and material resources are spent, due to fragmentary news, poor content, and inferior technology, it is difficult to be captivating and the propaganda effect is weak.

　　The reasons for the lengthiness of telegrams are no more than three: First, news is mixed with too much subjective commentary. We are not good at "letting the facts speak for themselves" and clarifying our views and attitudes through facts, so we inevitably fall into empty preaching. This kind of preaching sometimes appears as an editor's note, sometimes takes the form of mixed narration and commentary, and sometimes is simply a frank and unrestrained discussion. Regardless of the form, it is unnecessary in most cases (except in individual cases). Also, our "introductions" or "conclusions" sometimes lack specific content and are disconnected from the news facts themselves, resembling slogans. This is actually another form of commentary, which fails to truly serve as an "introduction" or "conclusion," but instead drowns out vivid facts, burdens the news, and causes the reader's dislike. Second, there is a lack of discernment in selecting materials. A single news item contains everything, including this and that. A large pile of current facts becomes a running account or a jumble, without knowing how to extract the essence and discard the dross, resulting in lengthy and verbose writing, while the truly typical and important content cannot be highlighted. This phenomenon is very common, whether in military news, introductions to production and construction, or reports on mass movements. Third, there is a lack of attention to presentation methods and saving words, with no distinction between telegrams and news, or even between telegrams and feature articles. Some branch offices often send news feature articles from local newspapers with a snip of the scissors. Upon receipt, the words "This Newspaper Report" or "This Newspaper Feature Article" are still prominently displayed, proving that they have not truly undergone the editing process, completing procedures such as sorting, supplementing, cutting, and rewriting. Therefore, they are generally raw materials rather than processed and revised news products. Raw materials are very rough and complex, requiring more words.

　　To solve this problem, we must start from ideological, business, and technical aspects, and it requires the efforts of the General Office, the Branch Offices, and all comrades engaged in news work. Ideologically, we must recognize that Xinhua News Agency is already a national news agency. In the past, its news telegrams were exclusively supplied to newspapers in the liberated areas. Now, in addition to these basic positions, it is also necessary to strive for adoption by various newspapers and periodicals in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Peiping, and even abroad. In the past, its propaganda target was the masses in the liberated areas. Now, in addition to this basic readership, it has expanded to many urban residents in the newly liberated areas, and it must also take care of people from all walks of life in the Kuomintang areas. In the past, its task was mainly to exchange information, work, and experience among the liberated areas. Now, in addition to this basic task (which is of course still an extremely important task), it must also use news from the liberated areas as a foundation to organize a national news network, enter and exit the domestic news stage, and compete with other news organizations. As such, the standard of our news reporting must be improved, and both the content and technology must be improved to make it more substantial, faster, more vivid, and more concise, so that it can meet the requirements of national propaganda, satisfy the hopes of a wider readership, and accomplish complex and arduous combat tasks. At the same time, based on our own work foundation, except for individual branch offices, most branch offices have already roughly taken shape and are able to maintain a certain amount of news supply. Currently, the problem is not the continued increase in quantity, but mainly the improvement in quality, to achieve less but better, so that each news item can fulfill a certain role. This is a big change, urgently needed by the current new situation, and it represents a new development and progress in our work. We believe that as long as everyone thinks through this issue ideologically and works hard to do it, it can be resolved.

　　In terms of business, we must strengthen editorial work, breaking the view that editing telegrams is purely a technical work, and we must clearly realize that editing telegrams is a political battle, and engage in this work with the highest sense of responsibility. We must investigate the readership more, study the propaganda attitudes of the enemy, friends, and ourselves. For each news item, seek the best reporting method to achieve the expected propaganda effect. We should cherish our own news works and constantly summarize our own writing experience to seek improvement. For example, news should not be mixed with commentary, comments and news should be separated as much as possible, materials should be selected and chosen, and truly important, typical, and vivid facts should be reported with a central emphasis. Writing should be concrete and concise, without wasting vivid materials or wasting writing skills. These can all be studied. In the style of news propaganda, we want to create a unique style, but in terms of reporting methods and writing techniques, we should learn more from others, especially from mature reporters in Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Their concise and lively style, their knack for making insightful points, their ability to grasp the essentials of everything, and their attitude of explaining the source of everything are very worthy of emulation.

　　Technically, under the current conditions of equipment difficulties, we should pay attention to saving resources, cancel the unlimited use of radio stations, and even if we have our own radio stations, telegrams are still telegrams. Too many telegrams are congested, cannot be sent out, and we must consider the day when we leave our own radio station and spend money to send telegrams. Currently, the General Office's reporting platform is already unable to cope. Therefore, the General Office has decided to impose a reasonable and appropriate limit on telegrams from various branch offices, that is, in the future, General Branch Offices, except in truly special circumstances (these special circumstances should be determined according to changes in the struggle situation; currently, the Northeast Branch Office can be considered an exception), should not send more than 2,000 words per day. This restriction is not purely passive, but gives each branch office a task, requiring them to improve the quality of news and fully utilize the reporting efficiency within the range of 2,000 words per day. Unlimited digital expansion will only lead to the indiscriminate issuance of news, technical and even political imprecision, while a certain word limit can improve the editor's sense of responsibility and promote the progress of reporting techniques. We believe that as long as the editing work is done well, 2,000 words per day is completely sufficient.

　　We have talked about the need for news to be concise more than once. But the General Office and the Branch Offices have not done enough in this regard. Now, it is raised as a very important issue, and we hope that it will no longer be seen as a simple issue of the number of words, but as a basic entry point for transforming news writing techniques, as the key to improving news quality, and as the main path to focusing on propaganda methods and effectiveness. Only with this understanding can we solve the problem ideologically. We ask each branch office, after receiving this letter, to contact their own actual work, launch a discussion, and tell us the experience gained, as a reference for the General Office to improve editorial work. - Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th).

### 电讯要简练

专栏：

　　电讯要简练新华社各地总分社、分社、支社暨特派记者：
    电讯是传达社会动态的紧急工具，在新闻中是最精干的形式。它以最简洁的文字和最高度的速率，来报导最重要的新闻。撰著电讯，不但必须紧缩字句，从而节省电费，而且必须时刻存在一个观念：“为了最迅速的报导。”
    然而我们的新闻电讯，无论总社广播或分社来报，往往违背这个原则，犯冗长和迟缓的毛病，结果：一，人力器材浪费很大。三月份分社来电总数，近六十万字，经总社采播的只十五万字，约四分之一，其余四分之三，即四十五万字，大多是浪费了。此四十五万字，由支社经分社总分社到总社，有四个转手，每次转手都是编、译、发三道手续，等于十二道手续，虚耗人工无法统计；而总社广播的十五万字，亦未必见得条条精彩，字字可用。事实上各报采用量，最多不过百分之八十。二，稿多且长，常使电报壅塞，难免发生积报现象，影响紧要稿件迅速发出，许多新闻往往因此失去时效。三，热中量的倾销，忽略质的提高，对业务技术不能迅速改进。四，最重要的是虽然花费人力物力不少，但由于新闻零碎，内容贫乏，技术低劣，难能引人入胜，宣传效果薄弱。
    电讯冗长的原因，不外三个：一，是新闻中夹杂太多的主观议论，我们不善于“让事实自己说话”，通过事实来表明主张和态度，于是不免陷于空头的说教。这种说教有时以按语出之，有时采取夹叙夹议办法，有时率性正面的侃侃而谈。无论形式如何，在大多数场合，都是不必要的（个别场合例外）。还有我们的“导语”或“结尾”有时缺乏具体内容，而且和新闻事实本身脱节，类似标语口号，实际是议论的又一形式，不能真正起“导语”或“结尾”的作用，反而淹没生动的事实，使新闻受累，引起读者的憎厌。二，是材料不知取舍。一条新闻什么都有，这也要，那也要，当前的事实堆个一大堆，成为一篇流水账，或一盘杂货摊，而不知掘其精华弃其糟粕，以致文字冗长噜嗦，而真正典型和重要内容，反无法凸出。这种现象很普遍，无论军事消息，生产建设介绍，或群众运动报导，都常有这种病症。三，是没有讲究表现方法和节省文字，电讯和新闻不分，甚至和通讯不分。若干分社常驻当地报纸的新闻通讯，一剪刀发来，收到时，“本报讯”或“本报通讯”字样，还赫然在目，证明并未真正经过编辑过程，完成整理、补充、剪裁，改写等等手续，所以一般多为原料，而非加工改选过的新闻成品。毛坯是很粗糙庞杂的东西，它需要占更多的字数。
    要解决这个问题，要从思想上业务上技术上三方面入手，并且需要总社、分社、和全体从事新闻工作同志的努力。在思想上，必须认识新华通讯社已经是个全国性的通讯社，过去它的新闻电讯一切专供应解放区报纸，现在除了这些基本阵地外，还要争取京、沪、渝、平乃至国外各种报刊采用。过去它的宣传对象是解放区群众，现在除了这部分基本读者以外，已经扩大到新解放区城市的许多市民，并且还必须照顾国民党区域的各阶层人士。过去它的任务，主要是交流各解放区的情形、工作、和经验，现在除了这个基本任务（当然仍是极重要的任务），还要以解放区新闻为基础，进而组织全国的新闻网，进出于国内新闻舞台，与其他新闻机关相抗衡。如是，我们新闻报导的水准，必须提高，内容和技术都要改进，使它更加充实，更加迅速，更加生动，更加简练，使之够得上全国宣传的要求，满足更广大的读者的希望，完成复杂而艰巨的战斗任务。同时以我们本身的工作基础来说，除了个别分社以外，一般分社都已粗具规模，能够保持一定数量的新闻供给。目前问题，不在于量的继续增多，主要还是质量的提高，做到少而精，使每条新闻都能尽到一定的作用，这是一个很大的变化，是当前新的情况所迫切需要的，它代表我们工作上的新的发展和进步。相信只要大家在思想上想通这个问题，认真努力去做，是可以获得解决的。
    在业务上必须加强编辑工作，打破把编辑电讯当作纯技术工作的观点，必须明白意识到编辑电讯，就是政治上的作战，以最高的责任心来从事这一工作。要多调查读者对象，研究敌、友、我三方的宣传态度。每条新闻，寻求最好的报导方法，来达到宣传上的预期效果。对于本身的新闻作品，应该珍视，并且不断总结自身的写作经验，求得改进。比如新闻不夹杂议论，评论和新闻尽可能分开，材料要有取舍选择，真正重要典型的和生动的事实，进行中心凸出的报导。写作具体而扼要，既不糟踏生动材料，又不浪费文笔。这些都可加以研究。在新闻宣传的作风上，我们要创造独特的风格，但在报导方法和写作技术方面，我们应该多多向他人学习，尤其向英、美、苏那些成熟的记者学习，他们那种简洁明快的笔调，画龙点睛的手法，凡事抓着要领的技能，以及事事说明出处的态度，是很值得取法的。
    在技术上，在目前器材困难的条件下，要注意节省物力，取消无限制使用电台，即使自己有电台，但电报总是电报，压得太多，发不出来，而且要设想到会有一天离开自己电台，花钱发电的时候。现在总社的通报台，事实上已经应付不过来。为此，总社决定，对各分社来个人为的适当限制，就是今后总分社单位除了真正特殊情况外（这种特殊情况应随斗争形势的变化决定，目前东北分社可属于特殊情况的例外），每日发电不得超过二千字。这种限制，并非纯粹消极性的，而是给各分社一个任务，要求提高新闻质量，每日在二千字范围内，充分发挥报导效能。无限制的数字膨胀，只会造成新闻的滥发，技术上乃至政治上的不精细，而一定字数的限制，反可提高编辑的责任心，推动报导技术的进步。我们相信只要编辑工作做得好，每天二千字是完全够用了的。
    新闻要简练，我们不止谈过一次。但总社和分社在这方面做得还很不够。现在作为很重大的问题提出，希望不要再把它看作一个简单的字数多少问题，而要看作是改造新闻写作技术上的基本入门，看作是提高新闻质量的关键，看作是讲求宣传方法和成效之大道。只有这样看法，我们思想上才能得到解决。我们要求各分社，在收到这封信后，联系本身实际工作，展开一个讨论，并将得到的经验告诉我们，以为总社改进编辑工作的参考。——新华通讯社（新华社延安二十四日电）。
