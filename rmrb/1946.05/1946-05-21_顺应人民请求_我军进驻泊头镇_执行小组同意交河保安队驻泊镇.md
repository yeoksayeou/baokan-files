　　Responding to the People's Request
    Our Troops Enter Botou Town
    Executive Group Agrees to Station the Jiaohe Security Team in Botou Town
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 18th] Representatives from the Military Mediation Department's Botou Town and Dezhou groups have agreed that the Jiaohe Security Team will remain stationed in the town to maintain public order. After the Eighth Route Army and local armed forces (Jiaohe Security Team) entered Botou on the 10th at the people's request, at approximately 12:00 noon that day, representatives from the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States from both groups arrived at the town's garrison headquarters by car to hold talks with Political Commissar Li of the Eighth Route Army's Bohai Military Region. During the talks, Political Commissar Li pointed out the facts of the incident on the 3rd of this month, when the puppet troops in Botou Town attacked Sanlitun, completely annihilating the Second Company of the Jiaohe Security Brigade. Government representative Chai Luohan disingenuously claimed: "More than 20 members of the Jiaohe Security Brigade were digging the Grand Canal embankment, and more than 30 soldiers from the Botou garrison (referring to the puppet troops) were protecting the embankment when they attacked them." U.S. representative Lieutenant Colonel Warner immediately and severely criticized, saying: "I was present when this happened, and I fully understand that you (referring to the government representative) said there were only thirty embankment protection soldiers, but in reality, they gathered five hundred people to attack them (referring to the Jiaohe Security Team)." The government representative was speechless because the facts were conclusive. U.S. representative Lieutenant Colonel Emmet of the Dezhou group affirmed: "Based on the above situation, it proves that the Botou garrison (referring to the puppet troops) attacked the CCP army, but the CCP army showed no sign of attacking Botou." Finally, all parties agreed that the Jiaohe Security Team would remain stationed in Botou Town.

　　顺应人民请求
    我军进驻泊头镇
    执行小组同意交河保安队驻泊镇
    【新华社河间十八日电】军调部驻泊头镇及德州两小组各代表，已同意由交河保安队留驻该镇，负责维持治安。自八路军及地方武装（交河保安队）应人民之请于十日进驻泊头后，当日十二时许，该两小组国共与美三方面代表均乘汽车抵达该镇卫戍司令部，与八路军渤海军区李政委举行会谈，当李政委指明泊头镇伪军本月三日进攻三里屯交河保安大队将第二中队全部歼灭事实经过后，政府代表柴洛汉诿称：“交河保安大队二十余人挖掘运河大堤，泊头驻军（指伪军）三十余为护堤才向其出击。”美方代表华纳中校当即严予指责谓：“此事发生时，我适在场，我完全明白你们（指政府代表）说仅有三十个护堤士兵，但实际上却纠集了五百人进击他们（指交河保安队）”，政府代表因事实确凿，无言以对。德州小组美方代表掩特中校肯定地说：“根据以上情形，证明泊镇驻军（指伪军）是向中共军进攻的，中共军却没有丝毫进攻泊镇的象征。”最后各方代表同意由交河保安队留驻泊头镇。
