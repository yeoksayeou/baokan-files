　　Shameful Ta Kung Pao Editorial
    ——New China Daily, Chongqing, April 18 Editorial
    The Ta Kung Pao in Chongqing and Shanghai published an editorial these past two days titled "The Shameful Battle of Changchun." This is a shameful editorial by Ta Kung Pao, and we feel sorry for Ta Kung Pao after reading it.
    This editorial acknowledges that the Northeast problem involves internal affairs, that the civil war in the Northeast is heartbreaking, and that the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have not been implemented. But who doesn't acknowledge that the Northeast problem involves internal affairs? Who is undermining the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference? The Chinese people and people abroad all know that this is due to the "stubborn elements" of the Kuomintang, as General Marshall put it. Not only does Ta Kung Pao not dare to speak this simple truth, but it also uses the Battle of Changchun as a pretext to insinuate and blame the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, thereby exonerating the stubborn faction and helping them as accomplices. This is truly shameful!
    The Kuomintang reactionaries have launched a civil war for at least seven months, and have been waging civil war in the Northeast for at least five months, using American guns to massacre their own compatriots. Since January of this year, they have attacked Yingkou, Jianchang, Fuxin, Panshan, Liaozhong, Tai'an, Fushun, Liaoyang, Tieling, Haicheng, Anshan, Dashiqiao, Kaiyuan, Faku, Changtu, Benxihu, Gaiping, and Sipingjie, attacking so many places and violating the two ceasefire agreements of January 13 and March 27. Yet, we have not heard Ta Kung Pao utter a single word of "shameful" about these crimes. Now, regarding the "Battle of Changchun," Ta Kung Pao suddenly says this battle is "shameful." For the editorial writers of Ta Kung Pao, anything the Kuomintang fascist reactionaries do to strike at the people, harm the people, tear up promises, and launch civil wars, no matter how big, is not "shameful." Only when the people fight back against such reactionaries does it become intolerable, does it become "shameful." The Ta Kung Pao editorial writers are so opposed to the people, it should be "shameful" enough, right?
    The Ta Kung Pao editorial writers say, "The Northeast belongs to the country." Very well, may I ask what country you are talking about? Is it a country under the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang? Or is it a democratic country of the Chinese people? Under the former country, the receiving personnel "ascend to the five sons status," bureaucratic capital makes a fortune, and secret service atrocities emerge endlessly. There, the so-called "victory disaster" occurs, the number of famine victims exceeds three times that of Europe, and the national industry closes down. The people gnaw on tree bark and grass roots. One in ten women in Hankou is a prostitute, and human flesh in Guangzhou's human flesh market is cheap, only worth ten cigarettes. "The Northeast belongs to the country." Is the Northeast part of this kind of "country"? The people across the country have suffered enough from this kind of "country." Should the people of the Northeast, after suffering the pain of fourteen years of national subjugation, obediently accept the suffering of this kind of "country"? China can have a good country, the prototype of which has already been seen in the liberated areas. If the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are implemented, the whole country can slowly build a democratic new country based on this prototype, a country where the people truly have sovereignty. To say nothing else, the liberated areas at least do not have "receiving officials who ascend to the five sons status," no bureaucratic capital, no secret service atrocities, no people starving to death, no beggars, no prostitutes. Do the people of the Northeast and the people of Changchun necessarily not allow these "treasures" of a one-party dictatorship "country," necessarily not allow themselves to be liberated, otherwise they are not considered "part of the country"?
    The most shameless part of the Ta Kung Pao editorial is that it actually wrote this passage: "The attacking tactics often use unarmed civilians as vanguards, with machine guns and mortars behind them to supervise the battle. The unarmed vanguards fall in piles, and only after exhausting the enemy's firepower do they officially engage in combat. May I ask what kind of tactics these are? Extremely cruel, extremely shameful." Good, we also ask the Ta Kung Pao editorial writers, are these words responsible, or are they just farting for the sake of farting? You say "attacking tactics," insinuatingly referring, of course, to the tactics of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army in attacking Changchun. How do you know that the Northeast Democratic Allied Army uses such tactics? To put it bluntly, apart from the secret service agencies that specialize in spreading rumors and opposing the Communist Party and the people, apart from copying from newspapers run by Kuomintang "experienced special operations comrades," one cannot find such tactics anywhere else in the world. In order to slander the Northeast People's Democratic Allied Army, Ta Kung Pao does not hesitate to write such words, lowering itself to the status of a secret service newspaper. In your opposition to the people, you have truly gone all out, truly "extremely cruel, extremely shameful"!
    Why did Ta Kung Pao suddenly publish such an editorial? Everyone remembers that when the Kuomintang fascist group instigated reactionary anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-people demonstrations in February, vandalizing the New China Daily and the Democratic Daily, it was this "public" Ta Kung Pao that first launched a large-scale anti-Soviet campaign in its editorials, acting as the vanguard of the most brutal and shameless secret service atrocities of the fascists. Afterwards, many young students who were deceived by this reactionary newspaper realized the trick and shouted, "We were fooled by Ta Kung Pao!" Ta Kung Pao has young people inside, but its editorial writers are originally such powerful accomplices of the fascists, pretending to be liberal in normal times, and coming out to serve as much as possible when it comes to a critical juncture, when the fascists want to take action. Not only do they serve, but they also act as pathfinders for the fascists, as tigers for the man-eating tigers, and as dogs for the executioners, in order to get some favor from the fascists and executioners, lick the leftover blood, and chew on the leftover bones. The Ta Kung Pao editorial writers have exposed their true colors more than once. This time, the Ta Kung Pao editorial writers have once again exposed their true colors, and the people must be seriously vigilant!

### 可耻的大公报社论——重庆新华日报四月十八日社论

　　可耻的大公报社论
    ——重庆新华日报四月十八日社论
    重庆和上海的大公报，前昨两天登载了题目叫作《可耻的长春之战》的社论，这是大公报一篇可耻的社论，我们读了，实为大公报惜。
    这篇社论，承认东北问题有内政问题，承认东北的内战令人伤心，承认停战令和政治协商会议决议没有实行。但是谁不承认东北问题有内政问题？谁破坏停战令和政治协商会议决议？中国人民，中外人士，都知道这就是由于马歇尔将军所说的国民党“顽固分子”作祟。大公报不但不敢说出这种浅显的真理，反而借长春战争为题，含沙射影，归罪于中共和中国人民，这样来替顽固派开脱罪名，并替顽固派帮凶，真是可耻极了！
    国民党反动派发动内战，至少也有七个月了，在东北进行内战，至少也有五个月了，拿了美国的枪炮，屠杀自己的同胞。今年一月以来，攻营口、攻建昌、攻阜新，攻盘山，攻辽中、攻台安、攻抚顺、攻辽阳、攻铁岭、攻海城、攻鞍山、攻大石桥、攻开原、攻法库、攻昌图、攻本溪湖、攻盖平、攻四平街，攻了那么多地方，破坏了一月十三日与三月二十七日两次停战协议，却一直没有听见大公报对这些罪行说过一句“可耻”，到现在“长春之战”，大公报忽然说这一战是“可耻”的了。对于大公报的社论作者，凡是国民党法西斯反动派打击人民、残害人民、撕毁诺言、发动内战等事情，那怕天大的事，都是不“可耻”的，只有人民对于这种反动派还一还手，那就不得了，那就是“可耻”的了。大公报社论作者如此反对人民，应该是够“可耻”的了吧。
    大公报社论作者说：“东北是国家的”。很好，请问你说的是什么国家，是国民党一党专政的国家么？还是中国人民的民主国家？在前一种国家之下，接收人员“五子登科”，官僚资本大发横财，特务暴行层出不穷，那里发生所谓“胜利灾”，饥民数目超过欧洲三倍，民族工业关门大吉，人民啃着树皮草根。汉口十个妇女中有一个妓女，广州人肉市场便宜到只值十枝香烟。“东北是国家的”，东北难道是这种“国家”的么？全国人民受尽了这种“国家”之苦，难道东北人民受了十四年亡国惨痛以后，还应该服服贴贴来受这种“国家”之苦么？中国可以有个好国家，其雏型已见于各解放区，如果政协决议实现，全国就可以慢慢照此雏型建立一个民主的新国家，真正人民有主权的国家。不说别的，解放区里至少至少没有“五子登科”的“接收大员”，没有官僚资本，没有特务暴行，没有饿死的人，没有乞丐，没有妓女。难道东北人民和长春人民一定不许没有这几件一党专政的“国家”的“宝贝”，一定不许得到自己的解放，否则就算不“是国家的”了么？
    大公报社论最无耻的，就是居然的写出这样一段：“进攻战术，常是用徒手的老百姓打先锋，以机枪迫击炮在后面督战。徒手的先锋队成堆成堆的倒了，消耗了对方火力以后，才正式作战，请问这是什么战术，残忍到极点，可耻到极点”。好的，我们也请问大公报社论作者，这几句话是负责任的话，还是只当放屁放一放的呢？你说“进攻的战术”，含沙射影，当然指的是东北民主联军进攻长春的战术而言。你从什么地方知道东北民主联军用这样的战术？拆穿了说，除了从专门造谣反共反人民的特务机关那里以外，除了从国民党“素有经验的特工同志”办的报上抄来以外，世界上找不出这样战术。大公报为要污蔑东北人民的民主联军，不惜写出这种话来，把自己降低到一个特务报纸的地位，你在反人民这一点上，真是做到家了，真正“残忍到极点，可耻到极点”！
    大公报为什么忽然登出这样社论来？大家记得，当二月里国民党法西斯集团策动反苏反共反人民的反动游行、捣毁新华日报和民主报的时候，就是这个“大公”的大公报，首先在社论上大肆反苏，做法西斯进行最残暴无耻的特务暴行之先锋。事后，许多被这个反动的报纸骗了的青年学生，才觉悟其中的鬼把戏，大呼“上了大公报的当”！大公报里是青年人的，但它的社论作者，原来是这样一个法西斯的有力帮凶，在平时假装自由主义，一到紧要关头，一到法西斯要有所行动时，就出来尽力效劳。不但效劳，而且替法西斯当开路先锋，替吃人的老虎当虎伥，替刽子手当走狗，以便从法西斯和郐子手那里讨得一点恩惠，舐一点喝剩的血，嚼一点吃剩的骨头。大公报社论作者暴露其原形，不止一次。这一次大公报社论作者又把自己的原形暴露出来了，人民必须严重警惕！
