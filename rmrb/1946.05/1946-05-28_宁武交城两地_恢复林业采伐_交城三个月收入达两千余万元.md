　　Ningwu and Jiaocheng Areas
    Restore Forestry Logging
    Jiaocheng's Income Reaches Over 20 Million Yuan in Three Months
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 21st Dispatch] Forestry in Jiaocheng and Ningwu, which had been suspended for many years, has now resumed logging and is organizing large-scale exports. The Trade Bureau has set up timber and medicinal herb purchasing offices in the mountainous areas of Jiaocheng, extensively organizing the masses to gather resources. There are over 500 people in large labor exchange teams who have signed contracts with the Trade Bureau for regular logging. There are also many smaller labor exchange teams. From January to April, the income from timber sold to other areas reached over 20 million yuan. Medicinal herbs are the second most important sideline product in the area, generating substantial profits as well. The Ningwu Timber Management Committee began organizing logging last month, with over 1,000 laborers participating in this production. Measures are being taken to absorb public and private capital, organize limited liability joint-stock companies, promote labor-capital cooperation (using labor to offset capital contributions), and encourage the masses to freely organize cooperatives. The Forestry Management Committee is actively conducting registration and organizational work, with many people coming to register from various mountains. To prevent indiscriminate logging and protect the forests, the government has also sent specialists to provide guidance in the logging areas. Before the war, timber was an important product for the people of Ningwu and Jiaocheng. There were dozens of factories engaged in timber logging. The materials produced could be used for utility poles and construction. They were transported down the Fen River to central and southern Shanxi, and Henan. During the enemy occupation, the timber factories were destroyed, and all forestry operations were suspended. Now, under the leadership of our democratic government, logging has begun to recover.
