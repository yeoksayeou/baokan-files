　　Japanese Communist Party Attends New Parliament for the First Time
    Proposes Opening National Granaries to Relieve Famine Victims
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Tokyo dispatch: Five Japanese people's representatives, Japanese Communist Party leaders Okano Susumu, Tokuda Kyuichi, Shiga Yoshio, and others, attended the opening ceremony of the new parliament after the Japanese general election on the 16th. This is the first time in the history of the Japanese parliament that truly representative voices of the people can be heard. On the first day of the parliamentary session, about 5,000 Japanese railway workers staged a demonstration outside the Diet building, which interrupted the meeting for a time. When electing the speaker, the Japanese Communist Party members and the left-wing members of the Socialist Party united to compete for the position of speaker. When the reactionary Liberal Party, under the pretext that the Japanese Communist Party had few seats, presumptuously claimed that it was "not qualified" to be the speaker, Tokuda sternly refuted it, saying, "We represent the interests of 90% of the entire population." However, because the reactionary faction occupied the vast majority of seats in the parliament, the speaker was usurped by Miki from the Liberal Party, and the vice-speaker was seized by Kimura from the Progressive Party. During the discussion of the agenda, the Japanese Communist Party proposed to first discuss the lives of 15 million famine victims, and specifically pointed out the relief plan, demanding that national warehouses and imperial family rice reserves be immediately distributed to the famine victims.

　　日共首次出席新议会
    提议开放全国粮库救济饥民
    【新华社延安十九日电】东京讯：五位日本人民代表、日共领袖冈野进、德田球一、志贺义雄等，于十六日首次出席日本大选后新议会的揭幕典礼，这是日本议会有史以来第一次开始能听到真正代表人民利益的呼声。议会第一天开会时，日铁路工人约五千人，曾在国会大厦外作示威游行，会议曾因此一度中断。在选举议长时，日共议员与社会党左派议员，即联合起来争取议长职位，当反动派自由党借口日共议席少，妄言“无资格”任议长时，德田即予以严正驳斥道：“我们代表着占全人口百分之九十的人民利益”，但终于因反动派窃居议会绝大多数席位，因此议长由自由党的三木，副议长由进步党的木村霸占。在讨论议事日程时，日共提出首先讨论救济一千五百万饥民的生活，并具体指出救济方案，要求立即发放全国仓库与皇室存米给饥民。
