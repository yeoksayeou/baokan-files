　　Iranian Prime Minister Sultani Broadcasts
    Iran and the Soviet Union Establish Friendly Relations
    Condemns Reactionary Members of Parliament for Creating Discord Between Iran and the Soviet Union; Azerbaijan Delegation Invited to Visit Iranian Capital
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 22nd Dispatch] Tehran Dispatch: Iranian Prime Minister Sultani delivered an important speech on Tehran Radio, saying: "Due to constant concern for correct foreign policy, the relations between Iran and the Soviet Union have changed, and friendly relations have been established. Although negotiations on the issue of relations between the Iranian government and the Province of Azerbaijan have not fully reached an agreement, I believe that if we take the correct path, the Azerbaijan issue, which concerns the entire people, will be resolved." He praised the Azerbaijan delegation led by Pishvari for showing a good attitude in the negotiations. Sultani then denounced the traitorous actions of certain reactionary members of parliament, saying: Some members of parliament create discord between Iran and the Soviet Union, incite major powers to oppose Iran, and run around in the embassies of a certain foreign country. Sultani pointed out that Iran's internal affairs should not be interfered with by any country. He stressed that Iran's foreign policy is to maintain friendship with all major powers, especially with the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. He denied that he would be forced to resign, and said: Traitors oppose Pishvari being nominated as a member of the Iranian parliament, creating an image of discord. All of this is an attempt to create a serious situation so that they can be re-elected as the next members of parliament. Sultani said: He is very aware of the schemes of these traitors.
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 23rd Dispatch] Tehran Dispatch: Tabriz Radio broadcast last night that "the Azerbaijan delegation has, at the invitation of Iranian Prime Minister Sultani, departed for Tehran to investigate the Iranian government army's attack on the Azerbaijan border." Prior to this, Tabriz Radio had repeatedly broadcast news of border conflicts in Azerbaijan, claiming that the Azerbaijan army had repelled two attacks by the Iranian government army under the instructions of reactionaries. The broadcast declared that Tabriz had entered a state of martial law and called on the Iranian Prime Minister to immediately stop the offensive actions. Subsequently, Sultani issued a statement admitting that there had been border conflict incidents. The Iranian government on the 20th ordered the Iranian government army on the Azerbaijan border not to attack. "Violators will be subject to military law."

    痛责国会反动议员制造伊苏不和阿塞拜疆代表团应邀赴伊京
    【新华社延安二十二日电】德黑兰讯：伊朗总理苏尔丹尼在德黑兰广播电台发表重要演说，他说：“由于经常关心正确的外交政策，伊朗与苏联的关系，已经转变，并且已经建立了友好的关系。对于伊朗政府与阿塞拜疆省关系问题谈判，虽未完全达成协议，但我相信，我们采取正确路线，会使全民关心的阿塞拜疆问题，得到解决”。他称赞以皮希瓦利为首的阿塞拜疆代表团，在谈判中表现了良好的态度。苏尔丹尼继斥责若干反动的国会议员的卖国行动说：某些议员制造伊苏不和，煽动各大国反对伊朗，并奔走于某一外国的使馆。苏尔丹尼指出伊朗内政是任何国家都不能干涉的。他力称：伊朗的外交政策，为与各大国尤其是与英美苏三国均保持友善，他否认他将被逼辞职，并称：卖国者反对皮希瓦利被提名为伊朗国会议员，而造成不和之象。凡此一切，均在企图制造严重局面，俾他们可再当选为下届议员。苏尔丹尼说：他对这些卖国者的奸计，很了如指掌。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】德黑兰讯：大不里士电台昨夜广播称：“阿塞拜疆代表团，已应伊总理苏尔丹尼之请，启程赴德黑兰，以便调查伊政府军对阿塞拜疆边境之进攻”。前此大不里士电台曾接连广播阿塞拜疆边境冲突的消息，据称：阿军已击退在反动分子指示下的伊朗政府军的两次进攻。广播宣称：大不里士已入戒严状态，并吁请伊总理立即制止进攻行动。其后，苏尔丹尼发表声明，承认边境有冲突事件。伊政府二十日命令阿塞拜疆边境的伊朗政府军不得进攻。“违者将受军法审判”。
