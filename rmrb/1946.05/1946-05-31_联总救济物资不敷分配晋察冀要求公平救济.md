　　【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 27th】 The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region has received a total of 270 tons of UNRRA relief supplies to date. The China Liberated Areas Relief Association here feels immense difficulty in distributing the aforementioned materials, because there are more than four million disaster-stricken people in the entire region crying out for food. Even according to the opinions of UNRRA and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), the supplies are first distributed to the masses in the disaster areas of Har Province. However, the disaster victims in need of relief in that area alone number more than 562,000 people. On average, one sack of flour is received per 261 people, one package of old clothes per 187 people, and one package of socks and shoes per 2,811 people. Democratic governments in various places, adopting a completely people-responsible attitude, conduct in-depth and careful investigations and prioritize the distribution of relief materials to the most impoverished disaster victims. People from all walks of life here sincerely hope that UNRRA and domestic relief organizations will conduct fair relief efforts based on the serious war wounds of the border region and the various principles stipulated in the UN Charter.

　　联总救济物资不敷分配晋察冀要求公平救济
    【新华社张家口二十七日电】晋察冀边区迄今共收到联总救济物资二百七十吨，此间中国解放军救济分会，对上项物资之分发，感到莫大困难，因全境有四百余万灾胞嗷嗷待哺，即按联总及行总意见先行分配给哈省各灾区群众，但该地需要救济之灾民，即达五十六万二千余人，平均二百六十一人得到一袋面粉，一百八十七人得到一包旧衣，二千八百一十一人得到一包鞋袜。各地民主政府，采完全对人民负责的态度，深入慎重调查，尽先将救济物资发给最贫苦的灾胞。此间各阶层人士咸望联总及国内各救济机关，根据边区严重的战争创伤，和联合国章程所规定的各项原则，进行公平的救济。
