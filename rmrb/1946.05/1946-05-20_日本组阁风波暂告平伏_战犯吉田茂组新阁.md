　　Japanese Cabinet Crisis Temporarily Subsides
    War Criminal Shigeru Yoshida Forms New Cabinet
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an Seventeenth Dispatch] Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese cabinet crisis, which has lasted for twenty-five days, came to an end on the afternoon of the 16th due to the failure of Socialist Party Secretary Tetsu Katayama to form a cabinet and the Emperor's formal appointment of Shigeru Yoshida, the new president of the Liberal Party, as the new cabinet prime minister. After accepting the "Imperial Order," Yoshida issued a statement on the formation of the cabinet, stating: "In view of the urgent food situation, the Emperor ordered me to form a cabinet as soon as possible. I want to quickly form a national cabinet (referring to a coalition cabinet of reactionaries including the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the National Cooperative Party)." The last broadcast from Tokyo on the evening of the 16th stated: Takashi Saito, the leader of the Progressive Party, will serve as the new cabinet's Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of State. Yoshida's rise to power is a step taken by the Japanese ruling class to try to make up for the divisions that occurred after the general election in order to deal with the increasingly developing Japanese democratic front. The reason why Kijuro Shidehara brought out Yoshida was because Yoshida was a bureaucrat close to Shidehara's father-in-law, the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu, and also a pro-Shidehara figure in the Liberal Party (backed by the Mitsui Zaibatsu). In a sense, Yoshida's new cabinet is an extension of the Shidehara cabinet, still an anti-democratic cabinet dominated by the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu's forces. Yoshida is a moderate diplomat bureaucrat of militarism. In 1919, he was a member of the Japanese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. In 1924, he served as the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang, actively supporting the Northern Warlords in opposing the Chinese people, and striving to invade our Northeast and Mongolia, and was a well-known conspirator against China at that time. In 1938, he served as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1930, he served as the ambassador to Italy and soon transferred to the ambassador to the United Kingdom, colluding with British and American appeasement figures, before returning to Japan before the July 7th Incident. Yoshida has connections with Japanese court officials and major Zaibatsu.

　　日本组阁风波暂告平伏
    战犯吉田茂组新阁
    【新华社延安十七日电】东京讯：延续二十五天的日本组阁风波，已于十六日下午因社会党书记片山哲的组阁失败和日皇正式授命新任自由党总裁吉田茂为新阁首相而告一段落。吉田接受“敕命”后，并发表组阁声明称：“鉴于紧急的粮食情况，天皇命余尽速组阁，余欲迅速组成一国民内阁（按即包括自由党、进步党、国民协同党的反动派的联合内阁）。十六日晚东京最后广播称：进步党首脑斋藤隆夫将出任新阁内相及国务大臣。按吉田上台，是日本统治阶级企图弥补大选以后所发生的分裂，以便对付日益发展的日本民主阵线的一个步骤，币原之所以拉出吉田，是因为吉田是与币原的岳父三菱财阀接近的官僚，又是在自由党（以三井财阀为背景）中亲近币原的分子。吉田新阁在某种意义上说，是币原内阁的延长，仍旧是以三菱财阀势力为主的反民主内阁。吉田为军国主义稳健派外交官僚，一九一九年为日本出席巴黎和会代表团的随员，一九二四年任日驻沈阳总领事，积极支持北洋军阀反对中国人民，并力谋侵犯我东北和蒙古，为当时著名的侵华阴谋家。一九三八年任外务省次长，一九三○年任驻意大使，不久转任驻英大使，与英美绥靖主义分子勾结，至七七事变前返日。吉田与日本宫廷重臣及大财阀，均有联系。
