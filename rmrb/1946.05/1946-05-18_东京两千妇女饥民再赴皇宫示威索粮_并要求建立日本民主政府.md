　　Tokyo dispatch: Following a petition to the Imperial Palace by 1,200 Japanese people on the 12th, another 2,000 women, holding banners, demonstrated at the Imperial Palace yesterday. Twenty-five women representatives, carrying infants, demanded to enter the palace, asking Emperor Hirohito to respond to their demands made on the 12th to open the granaries to relieve famine victims and establish a democratic government. At the same time, they wanted to get milk for the babies, but were blocked by the Imperial Palace guards and pushed out of the palace. Many protesters surged forward, surrounding the guards. An army captain clashed with the demonstrators. When the guards and police on duty outside rushed in, the demonstration leader shouted to maintain order, saying: "Their refusal to meet our representatives is a trick, trying to provoke us into unrest, so they can use military and police force to defeat us. Let's not be fooled, let us achieve victory." One of the demonstration leaders, Communist Party member Yan Tao, condemned the authorities for violating their promise on the 12th to allow 30 representatives to meet on the 14th. The demonstrators sat on the ground and staged a spirited sit-down for up to five hours, waiting for Hirohito to personally respond to their demands. The Yomiuri Shimbun published the situation on the 12th when Japanese demonstrators entered the forbidden area of the Imperial Palace for the first time in Japanese history. They forcibly inspected the warehouses of Imperial Palace personnel and senior government officials, discovering a large amount of grain and a great deal of seafood, while the people are facing famine. The newspaper said: "Three full buckets of leftover rice were seen in the Imperial Palace, which Tokyo workers cannot afford."

　　东京两千妇女饥民再赴皇宫示威索粮
    并要求建立日本民主政府
    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：继十二日一千二百日人举行皇宫请愿后，昨日又有二千名妇女，手执旗帜，举行皇宫示威。二十五个妇女代表肩负婴儿，要求入宫，请日皇裕仁回答她们十二日提出的打开仓库存米赈济饥民建立民主政府的要求。同时，她们欲为婴儿索取牛奶，但为皇宫警卫所阻，并将她们推出宫外，许多游行者即蜂涌上前，将警卫包围，警卫某上尉与示威者发生冲突，门外布岗和警察急趋赴内时，示威领袖高呼遵守秩序，并称：“他们拒绝接见我们代表，是一种诡计，想以此激起我们骚动，然后他们好用军警武力来打败我们，我们不要上当吧，让我们得到胜利”。示威领袖之一共产党员盐鼗，谴责当局违反十二日曾允许十四日接见三十名代表之诺言。示威者席地而坐，并激昂高傲静坐达五小时，等待裕仁亲自回答要求。读卖新闻刊载十二日日本有史以来日本示威者首次进入皇宫禁地情形，他们强行观察了皇宫人员及高级政府官员的库房，发现其中有大量粮食以及极多海味，而人民则正面临饥馑。该报称：“皇宫内看到三满桶吃剩的米饭，正是东京劳动者所不能到口的”。
