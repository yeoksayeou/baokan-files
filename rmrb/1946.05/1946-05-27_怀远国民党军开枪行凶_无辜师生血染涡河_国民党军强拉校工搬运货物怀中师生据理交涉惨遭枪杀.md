    Nationalist Troops Forcibly Enlist School Staff to Carry Goods, Teachers and Students Reason and Are Tragically Shot
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd dispatch] Huaiyuan, Anhui dispatch: A shocking incident of Nationalist troops openly shooting and killing students has occurred here. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, all teachers and students of the Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School went to Da Wang Temple on the north bank of the Wo River to move bricks and tiles. They encountered a large boat belonging to the 12th Poison Gas Defense Battalion of the Military Affairs Department stationed in Huaiyuan. After the soldiers on the boat landed, they forcibly enlisted the school staff to carry goods. Teachers and students of the school came forward to reason with them, but unexpectedly, the officers of the battalion fired shots as a warning and tied up the school's military training instructor and several students, immersing them in the river to be waterboarded, subjecting them to extreme humiliation. More than 30 soldiers of the battalion, originally stationed in the city, also rushed to the scene with guns upon hearing the news. They opened fire on the school's teachers and students. After several tens of minutes, the squad leader of the battalion, Hu Zhonggui, led them back to camp singing a little tune. Student Yuan Yongxi was shot and killed on the spot. ××× was shot in the chest and is in critical condition. Others who were lightly injured and fell into the water include Ruan Zhenhua, Li Guangyi, and others. After the incident, the school's teachers and students immediately issued a declaration, expressing serious protest against this inhuman atrocity, demanding that the murderers be punished and that personal freedom be guaranteed. Students from nearby schools and people from all walks of life also expressed their hatred and launched a support movement, while also donating funds to comfort the dead and injured students.
