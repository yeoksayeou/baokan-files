　　Handan Municipal Government Investigates and Returns Enemy-Occupied Land to the Masses
    Peasants Become Masters of Their Own Land, Production Enthusiasm Soars
    [Special Dispatch from This City] The enemy's "North China Cotton Improvement Society" and the puppet "Daoyin Office" once forcibly bought more than 24 *qing* of land from the people at low prices in Liulinqiao, Xiaotunzi, Nanxinzhuang, Xinan zhuang and other villages around Handan, establishing four agricultural farms: Agricultural Experimental Farm, Cotton Industry School, Taikang Farm, and Wheat Garden Seed Nursery, causing the vast number of peasants who lost their land to suffer from hunger and cold and unable to live. After our liberation of Handan, many landless poor peasants immediately requested the municipal government to return the land forcibly bought by the enemy and puppets. The democratic government immediately sent special personnel to Liulinqiao and Xiaotunzi farms to conduct investigations, understand the masses' opinions on the farm land, and held meetings with village cadres to discuss and decide that, in addition to preserving the farm's public buildings and experimental sites, all land forcibly bought from middle and poor peasants would be returned to provide relief. 1,416 *mu* of the above land has already been returned before spring plowing. These peasants, who were plundered of their land by the enemy in the past, were like serfs, tilling a season of wheat for the enemy without compensation, and after the wheat harvest, they planted a season of autumn grain themselves, and still had to pay rent to the enemy. Now they have become masters of their own land again, and their production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. They are overjoyed and preparing to harvest wheat and sow autumn crops.
    [Another Dispatch] The municipal government is actively investigating and handling the issue of land and real estate in various urban districts of Chengguan that were invaded and occupied by the enemy and puppets during the war. In recent days, the Municipal Affairs Section, in coordination with cadres from the Nanguan District, has been investigating places such as the former puppet county cooperative warehouse and the public stadiums of the First and Second Commercial Centers. The enemy forcibly bought and plundered land from the masses at low prices to build warehouses. In order to protect the land rights and property rights of the masses, our democratic government, after investigation, specially convened a meeting of the landowners in the area to discuss solutions. Through democratic discussions among the masses, everyone agreed to sell the land occupied by the warehouse (now the参议会, [Presumably the local People's Consultative Congress]) to the government at its actual value, and to return all 19 *mu* of land outside the wall to the masses. On the morning of the 23rd, the Municipal Affairs Section had already measured the land owned by each household occupied by the warehouse and handled it separately. The masses were very satisfied. That evening, they continued to resolve the issue of land occupied by public buildings in the Second Commercial Center. (Bing)

　　邯郸市政府清查敌占田产发还群众
    农民成了自己土地的主人，生产情绪高涨。
    【本市讯】敌“华北棉业改进社”及伪“道尹公署”，曾在邯郸周围柳林桥、小屯子、南辛庄、西南庄等村，以贱价强逼买去民间土地达二十四顷多，建立农业实验场、棉业学校、太康农场、小麦园种圃等四处农场，使广大丧失土地的农民，饥寒交迫，无法生活。我解放邯郸后，许多失地贫苦农民，即向市政府要求发还敌伪强买去之土地，民主政府即派专人到柳林桥、小屯各农场进行调查，了解群众对农场土地意见，又和村干部开会讨论决定除农场公共建筑、实验场所予以保留外，将中贫农被敌强买去土地，全部发还以施救济，并已于春耕前将上项之土地一千四百十六亩发还。这些农民过去被敌人掠夺了自己的土地，像农奴一样，替敌人无代价的耕种一季麦子，麦收后自己种一季秋粮，还得给敌人出租子。现在他们重新成了自己土地的主人，生产情绪空前高涨，喜形于色，准备收麦种秋。
    【又讯】市政府对城关各区敌伪在时侵战占之土地房产问题，正积极进行调查处理。连日来市政科协同南关区干部，调查原伪县合作社仓库、第一、二商场公共体育场等地。敌人曾以贱价向群众强买掠夺土地，修盖仓库，我民主政府为了保障群众地权财权，调查后，特召集该地房主开会，讨论解决办法。通过群众民主讨论，大家同意愿将该仓库（现参议会）所占地产，按实值价卖给政府，墙外十九亩土地全部发还群众。二十三日午前，市政科已将该仓库所占各户地产丈量完毕，分别处理，群众甚为满意，当天晚间，并继续解决第二商场公共建筑所占地产问题。（冰）
