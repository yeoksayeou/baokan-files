　　【Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 22nd】 As the wheat harvest approaches, the stubborn and puppet troops have begun to mobilize forces and deploy to plunder the liberated areas' wheat harvest. Taiyuan has now established a "Grain Procurement Committee," with branch offices in central counties and sub-branch offices in general counties. In the Yan-controlled areas along the Tongpu Railway, youths are forcibly conscripted from each "lu" (a former administrative unit) to form grain-grabbing teams, initially three people per "lu" in the first phase and four in the second, with an expected training of one thousand people per county. These teams will coordinate with the attacking troops to enter the liberated areas to harvest wheat and orders have already been issued to forcibly requisition sickles and other tools. On the 15th, Yan's troops advanced from Taiyuan and Yuci in three routes toward the wheat-producing areas of the Jinzhong Liberated Area. One route, with over 400 people, surrounded Nanzhuang, the location of our Yuci County government. Another route occupied Beige Village, and the third route surrounded Zhangzhuang, later occupying Yongkang Village. On the 15th, Yan's troops in Shicun, Xiangling, transported two large carts of sickles to Linfen. The Yan's troops in Linfen also organized villagers near their strongholds, with able-bodied individuals formed into transport teams and the elderly and young formed into harvesting teams. The Yan's military county government in the county has issued an order to forcibly requisition three "shi" (a unit of dry measure) and eight "dou" (a smaller unit of dry measure) of wheat for every two silver dollars. The 66th Division of Yan's troops in Hongdong is implementing the procurement of military grain, totaling 2.2 million "jin" (a unit of weight). On the Pinghan front, the Kuomintang troops in northern Henan have transferred Li Ying and other puppet troops, veterans in grain-grabbing for eight years, from Anyang to Fengsu and other places in Andong. Wang Zi's entire force is now concentrated at Zhongdianji, northwest of Anyang, preparing to grab wheat. The masses in the entire area are indignant at this grain-grabbing conspiracy by the stubborn and puppet troops and are actively preparing to launch a struggle to protect grain.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 25th】 This year, the rainfall in the Hebei Liberated Area has been sufficient, and the wheat crops are thriving, promising a good harvest. The Kuomintang troops are salivating and have recently actively reorganized reactionary armed forces in various places, demanding sickles, preparing to dispatch them at the right time to seize wheat and steal the people's food. It is reported that the Kuomintang 30th Army in Beiping has distributed rifles and bullets to the "Returning Home Regiments" in the counties along the Pinghan Railway, and the Baoding Police Department is also forcibly requisitioning sickles from merchants to be used by the "Returning Home Regiments" to grab wheat. The soldiers and civilians in the liberated area are strictly guarding against this.
