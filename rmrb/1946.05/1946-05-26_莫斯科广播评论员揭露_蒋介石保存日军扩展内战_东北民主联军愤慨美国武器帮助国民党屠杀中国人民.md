　　Moscow Radio Commentator Reveals
    Chiang Kai-shek Preserved Japanese Troops to Expand Civil War
    Northeast Democratic Allied Army Indignant that American Weapons Help the Kuomintang Massacre the Chinese People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Moscow Radio today broadcast Masinu's commentary on the Chinese situation, stating: In China, Japanese troops have still not been punished. After announcing their surrender last year, Japanese troops continued to actively engage in military operations. Admiral Nimitz and the British Southeast Asia Headquarters both stated that the war was still continuing. However, on August 11th, Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding the above-mentioned facts, ordered the Eighteenth Group Army, i.e., the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and all anti-Japanese guerrilla forces, to cease military operations. Four days later, the Kuomintang reiterated the disarming of Japanese troops, but in reality, they were undermining the liberated areas. On September 3rd, He Yingqin sent a representative to deliver an official note from the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in China, Okamura, which stated: (1) Before the Kuomintang forces designated by Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin arrive, Japanese troops must not surrender to any "illegal armed forces" and should carry out effective defense, responsible for maintaining order. The so-called "illegal armed forces" here are the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which the National Government had formally recognized and resolutely advocated disarming the Japanese troops. (2) Japanese troops will remain in place and await orders. In He Yingqin's order, regarding special precautions, it was also stated that before the Chiang and He troops arrive, the Japanese troops must be responsible for recapturing and returning to the Kuomintang troops any locations lost by the Japanese troops. This order from Chiang and He supported the Japanese troops in actively resisting the Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army. The Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army, according to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order, turned to offensive operations in Central and North China in order to liberate their compatriots from Japanese oppression more quickly and to assist the Allied countries of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in defeating Japan in the shortest possible time. However, Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin not only did not disarm the Japanese troops, but ordered the Japanese troops to actively help the puppet troops such as Men Zhizhong to attack the Communist army in the liberated areas. Therefore, this order from Chiang and He made the Japanese troops in China not in the position of defeated troops after Japan's unconditional surrender, but in the position of allied troops. Chinese social figures believe that this order is a conspiracy to help the Chinese reactionaries and the Japanese warlords in China to possibly preserve Japanese military strength, undermine the KMT-CPC negotiations, and provoke the Chinese civil war. In reality, this order from Chiang and He has been used by Japanese and puppet troops to launch attacks on the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. In recent months, the Kuomintang military authorities have not only failed to disarm the Japanese troops, but have also used the Japanese and puppet troops to expand the Chinese civil war. Until now, Japanese combat troops continue to fight alongside other troops, attacking the Communist army and the liberated areas. Not only in Yan Xishan's subordinates, but also in other Kuomintang troops in North China, there are Japanese troops. In the Kuomintang's 87th Division, 120 Japanese troops are participating in the fighting. The U.S. military authorities in China are also using the Japanese armed forces on a large scale. Under the pretext of sending Japanese troops back to their country, they ordered the Japanese troops to perform sentry duties. Japanese officers and soldiers and generals who returned from China told their colleagues, friends, and the people at home about this situation, which encouraged the active activities of Japanese reactionaries and warlords. After Japan signed the instrument of surrender, the Japanese reactionaries and warlords not only did not become dejected, but also increasingly strengthened their rampant activities.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Moscow Radio: American Weapons Help the Kuomintang Massacre the Chinese People. TASS, Vladivostok, May 18th dispatch: A special correspondent for Pravda learned that since the Red Army withdrew from Manchuria, fierce fighting has broken out between the Kuomintang army and the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. According to reliable sources, some of the Kuomintang troops and American weapons have been captured by the Democratic Allied Army. This fact has aroused extreme indignation among the Democratic Allied Army.

　　莫斯科广播评论员揭露
    蒋介石保存日军扩展内战
    东北民主联军愤慨美国武器帮助国民党屠杀中国人民
    【新华社延安二十三日电】莫斯科今日广播马西努评中国局势称：在中国，日军仍没有得到惩办，去年宣布投降之后，日军仍积极进行军事行动。尼米兹海军上将与英军东南亚总部，都曾声称战争仍在继续中。然而八月十一日蒋介石不顾上述实际情况，即下令第十八集团军即八路军、新四军及一切抗日游击部队停止军事行动，过了四天之后，国民党重声明解除日军武装，实际却来瓦解各解放区。九月三日，何应钦派代表转交驻华日军总司令冈村通牒一纸，提出：（一）由蒋介石、何应钦所指派的国民党军未到达前，日军不得向任何“非法武装部队缴械，并应作有效的防卫，负责维持秩序”。这里所谓“非法武装部队”即是国民政府曾正式承认，而且坚决主张解除日军武装的八路军与新四军。（二）日军暂留原地，静候命令。在何应钦命令中，关于特别注意事项，并提出在蒋何军队到达以前，日军失去的地点，必须由日军负责夺回交还国民党军队。蒋何这一命令，支持了日军积极反抗十八集团军与新四军，十八集团军与新四军则按照朱总司令的命令，在华中、华北转为进攻，以便更快地将自己的同胞从日军压迫下解放出来，并协助苏英美各盟国于最短期间内击溃日本。而蒋介石与何应钦不但不去解除日军武装，却令日军积极帮助门致中等伪军，向解放区中共军进攻。所以蒋何这一命令，使在中国的日军在日本无条件投降后，不是处在战败军的地位，而是处在盟军的地位。中国社会人士认为这一命令，是帮助中国的反动派与在华日本军阀的阴谋可能保存日军兵力，破坏国共谈判，挑拨中国内战，实际上蒋何这一命令，已被日伪军利用实行进攻八路军与新四军。最近几月，国民党军事当局不仅未解除日军武装，而且利用日伪军来扩展中国的内战。直到现在，日本的战斗部队还是继续与其他部队共同作战，向中共军与解放区进攻。不仅是阎锡山部下，而且华北其他国民党军队中，都编有日军部队，现时在满洲展开进攻的国民党军内，同样有日本军队。在国民党八十七师内，即有一二零名日军参加作战。驻华美军当局也大规模利用日本武装部队，他们以派遣日军回国的名义，命日军执行哨兵的职务，从中国回国的日本官兵与将军，都把这种情形告诉自己的同僚、友人与国内人民，这便鼓励了日本反动派与军阀的积极活动。日本签订降书之后，日本反动派与军阀非但没有垂头丧气，而且日益加强其猖狂活动。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】莫斯科今日广播：美国武器帮助国民党屠杀中国人民。塔斯社海参威五月十八日电：真理报特派记者获悉，自红军自满洲撤退之后，国民党军队与东北民主联军之间，发生了激烈战斗。据可靠消息，国民党军队与美国武器已有一部分被民主联军俘获，这一事实，在民主联军中引起极端愤慨的情绪。
