　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government Promulgates "Three-Year Construction Plan"
    Strengthening Economic and Cultural Construction to Ensure Every Household is Well-Fed and Clothed and to Improve the Culture of Cadres and the Masses.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's 1946-1948 Construction Plan, having been adopted by the First Session of the Third Border Region People's Congress, has been officially promulgated by the Border Region Government and orders have been issued to all levels of government, military units, organs, and schools to earnestly implement it. The plan is divided into two major parts: economic construction and cultural and educational construction. The economic construction part, in terms of agriculture: In order to increase grain production, it is necessary to cultivate and hoe more, apply manure and accumulate fertilizer, prevent and control diseases and pests, promote improved varieties, and resettle immigrants for land reclamation, aiming to ensure that every household is well-fed and clothed and has surplus grain each year within three years. In order to increase cotton production, it is necessary to increase the yield to an average of ten jin of cotton per mu, and the area planted with cotton should be maintained at 350,000 mu, striving to reach 400,000 mu within three years. In order to develop agricultural crops with higher economic value, the Border Region will promote the planting of oil crops, sugar beets, white ramie, and alfalfa. To increase farmers' income, it is also necessary to develop mountain products and promote sideline occupations, such as collecting medicinal materials, raising silkworms, and beekeeping. In addition, it is necessary to build water conservancy projects, improve soil quality, plant trees and protect forests, develop fruit trees, breed livestock, and prevent and treat diseases. The plan believes that to promote the development of various agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry undertakings, it is necessary to continue to promote various labor mutual aid organizations in various places, gradually improve their role, formulate farmer household plans, reform idlers, settle refugees, absorb women into production, and continue to carry out the labor model movement. In terms of industry: Publicly-owned industries will develop petroleum, wool spinning groups, leather making, matches, soap, etc., and a machine repair and manufacturing company is planned to be established this year. Folk handicrafts and household sideline occupations, such as the already partially developed textiles, felt, wool bags, pile carpets, leather tanning, papermaking, oil pressing, silk weaving, straw hats, and porcelain, still need to be promoted and developed, such as the manufacture of tobacco from dried tobacco leaves, the extraction of soybean oil, the casting of iron tools, the refining of sugar and honey, etc. The democratic government will systematically assist the development of these folk handicrafts. In terms of cooperative undertakings: In the future, it will be practical to face the countryside, focusing on production, and combine with various rural household sideline occupations. The existing cooperatives will be thoroughly rectified and re-registered this year. In terms of trade: The tasks in the future are to expand the management of native products, support industrial development, regulate domestic and foreign markets, support cooperative undertakings, and support finance. In terms of finance: In the future, in order to enable it to cooperate with and assist the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, it is necessary to strive to stabilize finance, develop the economy, and support finance.
    Cultural and educational construction part: Regarding university education, the task of Yan'an University is to cultivate local higher-level intellectuals and improve the culture of existing middle-level cadres in the Border Region. Regarding secondary education, the various secondary schools in the Border Region should systematically cultivate middle-level intellectuals in the Border Region and improve the culture of existing district and township cadres in the Border Region. Regarding national education, the education of primary schools and public primary schools should improve their quality by improving teachers, providing textbooks on time, and overcoming the phenomenon of student mobility. Regarding national health, it is necessary to mobilize all the people in the Border Region to fight against disease and death, widely carry out health publicity and education to prevent diseases and epidemics, and strengthen the medical equipment and treatment work in the entire Border Region as much as possible. Regarding mass literature and art, various forms that the masses love to see and hear will be used to gradually improve the cultural life of the people in the Border Region, and strengthen the Border Region Literary Association and local theatrical troupes. Regarding mass newspapers and publishing and distribution, it is necessary to strengthen local newspapers, pay attention to cultivating local news work cadres, and strengthen the Border Region Bookstore and the Border Region Publishing Agency.
