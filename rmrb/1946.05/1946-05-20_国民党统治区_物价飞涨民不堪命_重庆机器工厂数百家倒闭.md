    Skyrocketing Prices Cause Public Suffering
    Hundreds of Factories in Chongqing Close Down
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continue to skyrocket daily. According to a Central News Agency report: as of the 12th, flour in Beiping had risen from 18,000 to 22,000 per bag, rice from 35,000 to 50,000 per 100 jin, gold from 150,000 to 210,000 per tael. In Nanjing, gold even reached 186,000, rice 34,000 per shi, and in Hangzhou, rice 40,000 per shi, gold 180,000. In Tianjin, rice was 40,000 per 100 jin, and gold above 200,000. In Jinan, rice was 40,000 per 100 jin, millet 27,000 per 100 jin, and flour 19,000 per 40 jin. In Qingdao, rice was 48,500 per 100 jin, while in Taiyuan, gold exceeded 245,000. Even worse, in the Chao-Shan area, rice rose to 160,000 per shi. In Guangzhou last month, on the 22nd, rice reached 60,000 per 100 jin. In Changsha last month, on the 23rd, rice reached 50,000 per shi, and it is now undoubtedly more.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th] Beiping News: Amid the rising prices of all goods, the publicly owned enterprises of bureaucratic capital took the lead. From the 1st, railway passenger transport increased sixfold, freight increased fourfold, and electricity increased by onefold. From the 7th, airmail postage also increased tenfold, with airmail letters increasing to 50 yuan per item. It is reported that tap water is also planning to increase its prices by 50% this month. Citizens are crying out in unison at the wave of price increases, calling it "open monopolistic speculation."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th] Chongqing News: Hundreds of machine factories in Chongqing during the war have closed down one after another after the victory. As of now, only a dozen or so remain, including Minsheng, Xinchang, Yuxin, Zhendan, Gongyi, and Waichuan. Even the existing factories are only partially operating, barely maintaining the situation. These factories recently requested financial assistance from the Ministry of Finance but were rejected. They are now preparing to complete the unfinished products and then shut down entirely.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] More than twenty counties and cities in Sichuan Province have public teachers and staff demanding that the Kuomintang authorities improve their treatment, and have launched strikes and teaching boycotts. In addition to the counties and cities of Chongqing, Chengdu, Tongliang, and Jiang'an reported yesterday, more than twenty counties, including Longchang, Huayang, Nanchuan, Changning, and Yibin, have recently risen up to demand higher pay. If it is not satisfactorily resolved, they have decided to resign en masse. This movement is still developing.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Central News Agency, Hengyang News: Refugees are crowded here, including more than 6,000 children, many of whom are sleeping on the streets. Dysentery and malaria are prevalent, and dozens of children are dying every day from illness.
