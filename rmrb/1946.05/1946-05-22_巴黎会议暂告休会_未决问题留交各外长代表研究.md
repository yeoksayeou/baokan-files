　　Paris Conference Temporarily Adjourned
    Unresolved Issues Left to Deputies of Foreign Ministers for Study
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which opened in Paris on the 25th of last month, temporarily adjourned on the 16th and is scheduled to reconvene in Paris on June 15th. According to Reuters, "The conference ended on the evening of the 16th with the four foreign ministers shaking hands and toasting to the success of their next meeting." The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States left Paris on the 17th to return to their countries. Before leaving, Bidault and Bevin held a 45-minute meeting to discuss the coal needs of France. Bevin also assured Bidault that he would re-examine the distribution of Ruhr coal based on the reasons he had presented. After a week of discussions, the conference partially resolved the treaty issues for Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. Partial agreement was also reached on issues such as the preamble, naval disposal, and reparations in the Italian issue. The main issues in the treaty, such as the Italo-Yugoslav border and colonial issues, remain unresolved. In the final meetings on the 15th and 16th, preliminary discussions on the German issue began. The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France suggested establishing a special committee to study the German issue and draft a peace treaty with Germany. Bidault also proposed convening a peace conference on Germany in November, which was rejected by Molotov. On the 13th, TASS described Bidault's plan as clearly likely to give new hope to the aggressive elements within Germany who are now trying to raise their heads. At the close of the conference, it was decided that all unresolved issues would be left to the deputies of the foreign ministers to continue studying in Paris during the foreign ministers' recess, so that they could be presented at the next meeting. The first meeting of the deputies of the foreign ministers was scheduled for the 17th.

　　巴黎会议暂告休会
    未决问题留交各外长代表研究
    【新华社延安十八日电】上月二十五日，在巴黎召开的四强外长会议，已于十六日暂告休会，定六月十五日在巴黎继续举行。据路透社称：“此次会议，十六日晚在四外长握手言欢，举杯庆祝他们下次会议成功声中结束”。苏英美三外长已于十七日离巴黎返国，行前贝纳斯、贝文曾与比道尔举行三刻钟会议，商讨法国所需煤炭问题。贝文并向比道尔保证，当根据他所提之理由重行审查鲁尔煤炭的分配情形。这次会议，经一周的讨论，已部分解决了对罗保匈芬的和约问题，对意大利问题中的序言、海军处理，及赔偿等问题，亦有部分同意。和约中的主要问题，如意南边境及殖民地问题等，仍未获解决。十五、六日最后数次会议上，对德国问题已开始作初步讨论，美英法三国外长曾建议设立一特别委员会，研究德国问题，并起草对德和约，贝纳斯并提议在十一月召开对德和会，均遭莫洛托夫的拒绝。十三日塔斯社对贝氏此一计划，描述为显系可能给予现在正试图抬头的德国境内侵犯分子以新希望。会议结束时，决定各项未决问题，留交外长代表在外长休会期间于巴黎继续研究，以便于下次会议中提出。各外长代表首次会议，则定十七日举行。
