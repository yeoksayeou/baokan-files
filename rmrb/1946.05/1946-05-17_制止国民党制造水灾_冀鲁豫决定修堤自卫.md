　　Stop the Kuomintang from Creating Floods
    The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Decides to Build Dikes for Self-Defense
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch News] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office held emergency meetings for three consecutive days from the 9th to the 11th to discuss the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course. Attendees included Director Jia of the Administrative Office, Secretary-General Luo, responsible persons from the Yellow River Committee of this region, and the second, fourth, and fifth administrative regions, county magistrates from various counties, and representatives of local gentry, totaling over 40 people. Aiming at the serious threat to the lives and property of 60 million people in Hebei and Shandong provinces caused by the Kuomintang’s failure to implement the Heze Agreement and continued blocking of the river mouth, the meeting discussed self-rescue measures. Everyone unanimously passed a resolution to build dikes to prevent flooding in order to smash the Kuomintang’s vicious plot to release water to inundate the people of our liberated areas. The dike will stretch approximately 300 kilometers from Hua County in the west to Xuzhou in the southeast. Within days, more than 200,000 people from various regions will go to the dike construction areas to begin work.
