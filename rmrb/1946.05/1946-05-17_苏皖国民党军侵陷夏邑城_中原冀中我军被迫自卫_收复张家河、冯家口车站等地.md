　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th】According to military news received by this agency today: (1) In the Northeast, the battle to defend Sipingjie has reached 26 days, and the city is still firmly defended by the Democratic Allied Forces. The morale of the Kuomintang troops is low, and they are now conscripting large numbers of Japanese prisoners of war. For example, the 87th Division secretly ordered the division to conscript 126 prisoners at a time. According to Moscow Radio: The Kuomintang is increasing its reinforcements equipped with American weapons, guaranteed by 2,000 US Marines stationed in Huludao to be sent to Shenyang. (2) In Jiangsu and Anhui, Kuomintang troops occupied Xiayi County, 100 kilometers west of Xuzhou, on the 10th. (3) In central Hebei, the puppet troops along the northern section of the Jinpu Railway continue to attack. On the 5th, the puppet Zhang Haiqing's troops launched a fierce attack on us from Fengjiakou Railway Station south of Cangzhou. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, repelled the army, and recovered Fengjiakou Railway Station and other places. In addition, the Kuomintang's 92nd Army and others on the Pinggu Road attacked the Chahar Liberated Area in Shunyi and Huairou. The 100th Regiment of the 34th Division of the Kuomintang's 72nd Army south of Huang'an, Hubei, occupied Zhangjiahe northwest of the town from Zhandian on the 6th, and launched an attack on the Shizi Shudian area on the 9th. Our army was forced to defend itself, repelled them, and recovered Zhangjiahe. However, the regiment continued to attack Zhangjiahe and other places. According to statistics from this agency, from the ceasefire order to the end of April, the Kuomintang army used a total force of more than 2.5 million, forcibly occupying 19 county towns and 210 villages and towns.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th】Huaiyin Telegram: Kuomintang troops occupied Xiayi County in the Jiangsu-Anhui border region on the 10th. The city is located 100 kilometers west of Xuzhou, within Henan Province, belonging to the Eighth Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region. Like Xiao County, it is a strategic point connecting the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, and the eastern Henan Liberated Area. The Kuomintang army has occupied two county towns, Xiao County and Xiayi, within two weeks, showing that the operations outside the Northeast have now become serious. People here believe that whether the Peiping Executive Headquarters and the Xuzhou Group can force the Kuomintang army to quickly withdraw from these two county towns will be a major test of whether the ceasefire order has any binding force.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 14th Urgent Telegram】Along the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, the arrogance of the puppet troops is increasing daily. In the month of April alone, they invaded the Liberated Area for more than 30 li and attacked more than 20 villages. The people of counties such as Jiaohe and Cangzhou have suffered deeply and have repeatedly requested rescue from the democratic government and the Eighth Route Army. The local military and political authorities, prioritizing the overall situation, have repeatedly advised, but all efforts have been ineffective, and they continue to suffer attacks. Finally, being forced to act, they implemented self-defense. On the evening of April 30, the strongholds of Nanpozi, Ershilitun, and Sundingtun, belonging to Jiaohe County, were recovered. On the 5th of this month, the puppet Zhang Haiqing's troops at Fengjiakou Railway Station, more than 20 li south of Cangzhou, fiercely attacked the Eighth Route Army in central Hebei. They were repelled, and Hongxindian, Fengjiakou Village, and Sanzhangzhuang, which had been liberated earlier but forcibly occupied by the puppet troops, were also recovered at the same time. The puppet troops retreated to Caizhuangzi and Fengjiakou Railway Station, holding them firmly and attacking, but due to the disintegration of military morale, they successively disintegrated. The Eighth Route Army recovered Caizhuangzi on the 6th and Fengjiakou Railway Station on the 7th. In this battle, more than 80 puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, more than 340 were captured, and more than 5 light machine guns and more than 500 rifles were seized.

　　苏皖国民党军侵陷夏邑城
    中原冀中我军被迫自卫
    收复张家河、冯家口车站等地
    【新华社延安十四日电】据今日本社收到的军事消息：（一）东北方面，四平街保卫战已达二十六天，该城仍在民主联军坚守中。国民党军士气低落，现征用大批日俘，如八十七师密令该师一次即征用一二六名。又据莫斯科广播：国民党正增调美械装备的援军，由在葫芦岛的美海军陆战队二千人保证开赴沈阳。（二）苏皖方面，国民党军队十日侵占徐州西一百公里的夏邑县城。（三）冀中方面，津浦北段沿线伪军不断进攻，五日伪张海清部，从沧州南之冯家口车站，向我猛攻，八路军被迫自卫，击退该军，并收复冯家口车站等地。此外平古路上之顺义，怀柔，国民党九十二军等进攻察哈尔解放区；湖北黄安以南国民党七十二军三十四师一百团，于六日由占店侵占该镇西北张家河后，九日向柿子树店一带进攻，我军被迫自卫，将其击退，并恢复张家河。但该团仍续向张家河等地进攻。根据本社统计，国民党军于停战令后至四月底，使用兵力共达二百五十余万，强占了十九座县城，二一○村镇。
    【新华社延安十四日电】淮阴电：国民党军于十日侵占苏皖边区夏邑县城，该城位于徐州西一百公里，在河南境内，属苏皖边区八分区，与萧县同为联接苏皖边区、冀鲁豫边区及豫东解放区的战略要点。国民党军在两周内连占萧县、夏邑两个县城，显示东北以外的作战现已严重化，此间人士认为，北平执行部及徐州小组，能否迫令国民党军迅速退出这两个县城，将为停战令究竟有无约束力量的重大考验。
    【新华社河间十四日急电】津浦北段沿线，伪军凶焰日张，仅四月份一个月内，即侵入解放区三十余里，进犯村庄二十余个。交河、沧州等县人民，因受害极深，纷纷向民主政府及八路军请求援救，地方军政当局仍以大局为重，多方规劝，均归无效，目继续遭受攻击，最后迫不得已，乃实行自卫，四月三十日晚，将交河县属之南坡子、二十里屯、孙定屯三处据点收复。本月五日，沧州南二十余里之冯家口车站伪军张海清部，又猛烈进攻冀中八路军，当被击退，早经解放，后被伪军强占之洪辛店、冯家口村、三张庄三地，亦经同时恢复，该伪即退至蔡庄子及冯家口车站内据坚攻击，但因军心焕散，相继解体，八路军于六日收复蔡庄子，七日收复冯家口车站。是役毙伤伪八十余名，俘三百四十余名，缴获轻机枪五挺，步枪五百余枝。
