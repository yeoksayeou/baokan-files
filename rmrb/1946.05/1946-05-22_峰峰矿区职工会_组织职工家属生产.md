　　Fengfeng Mining District Trade Union
    Organizes Production by Workers' Families
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The families of workers in the Fengfeng Mining District of Cixian County are actively engaging in production to establish happy families. The mine has a total of 500 family members. During the Japanese occupation, most relied on the wages of the men. One man often had to support three or four people. Because the wages were low, the families often couldn't make a living and were forced to wander and beg for food. After liberation, under the leadership of the trade union, a workers' cooperative was organized with 200,000 yuan in shares to purchase large quantities of cotton and spinning wheels to support the family members in spinning. At the beginning, some people were unwilling to spin. Hao Fenglin, a miner's family member, first organized a spinning group of seven people. The cooperative lent each person two catties of cotton and a spinning wheel. In 25 days, they spun a total of 54 catties of cotton, earning 3,510 yuan. This practical example encouraged all the families in the mine. Within three months, the number of women participating in spinning increased to 653. With the development of spinning, the families' thinking has also greatly improved. Many people have recognized the glory of labor and that they can only live a good life by relying on their own labor. Family spinning is still continuing to expand.

　　峰峰矿区职工会
    组织职工家属生产
    【本报长治讯】磁县峰峰矿区职工家属，正积极进行生产，建立幸福的家庭。该矿共有家属五百人，日寇占领时，大都依靠男人工资生活，一人甚至有养活三四人者，由于工资低微，一家常常不能维持生活，被迫到处流离和讨饭。解放后，在职工会领导下，组织了职工合作社，集股二十万元，大量购买棉花与纺花车，扶助家属妇女纺织。开始时，有些人还不愿纺织。矿工家属郝凤林，首先组织起一个七人纺织小组，合作社每人借给棉花二斤，纺车一架，在二十五天中，共纺花五十四斤，赚洋三千五百一十元。这一实际例子，鼓励了全矿家属，在三个月内，参加纺织的妇女即增至六百五十三人。随着纺织的发展，家属思想也有很大的进步，许多人认识了劳动的光荣，依靠自己劳动才能过好光景。现家属纺织仍在继续扩大中。
