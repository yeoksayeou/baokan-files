　　Heavy Taxes Imposed by the Kuomintang Government
    Wuhu, the Rice Market, Faces a Grain Shortage
    At Least 70% of Villagers Have Nothing to Eat
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 25th Dispatch] Wuhu, known as one of the three major rice markets, is facing a severe grain shortage due to heavy taxes and levies under the guise of "exempting field taxes." The various levies imposed by the Kuomintang government in Wuhu include: 1. "Local Autonomy Subsidy Fee," amounting to 230 million yuan; 2. Pre-payment of 10,000 shi of military grain; 3. County-level public grain, 15,000 shi were already paid in the first half of the year, and another 15,000 shi must be paid off by July and September; 4. Police uniform fees and house tax, 50 million yuan per month; 5. Toilet expenses, each town bears the cost of one toilet; 6. Women's Association fee, 200 yuan per member, one person per household. In addition, the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps' construction of radio stations and road repairs are all funded by the Baojia chiefs who collect money from each household. Under this high pressure, the people of Wuhu widely spread a song: "The town chief holds meetings every day for money, the Bao chiefs collect money and indulge in wine and women, the Jia chiefs accompany them in collecting money with smiling faces, when will the common people have a victorious year!" The extent of the grain shortage in Wuhu is such that even Peng Yihou, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang County Party Committee, could not help but admit at a reception for reporters that medium-sized farmers in the countryside cannot find more than one dou of stored grain, and at least 70% of the villagers have nothing to eat.

　　国民党政府捐税重
    大米市芜湖闹粮荒
    乡民至少七成没有饭吃
    【新华社淮阴二十五日电】号称三大米市之一的芜湖，在“豁免田赋”名义下，捐税重重，形成严重粮荒。国民党政府在芜湖之各种摊派有：一、“地方自治补助费”，数达二万万三千万元；二、预缴军粮一万石；三、县级公粮，上半年一万五千石已缴过，下半年一万五千石，限七、九月缴清；四、警察制服费、房捐，每月五千万元；五、厕所经费，每镇负担一个厕所；六、妇协会费，每员二百元，每户一人。此外，三青团建造广播电台及修建马路等，均由保甲长挨户派款。芜湖人民处此高压下，普遍流传一首歌云：“镇长天天开会为了钱，保长收钱酒地又花天，甲长陪着收钱满笑脸，老百姓那天才过胜利年！”芜湖粮荒程度，即国民党县党部书记长彭一侯在招待记者席上，也不能不承认说，乡里中等农家，找不到一斗以上存粮，乡民至少七成没有饭吃。
