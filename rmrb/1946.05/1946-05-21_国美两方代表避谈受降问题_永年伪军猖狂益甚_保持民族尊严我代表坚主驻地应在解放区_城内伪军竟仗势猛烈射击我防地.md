　　[This Newspaper, Handan, 17th Dispatch] The Yongnian group's trip to Yongnian this time, our representative earnestly hoped to immediately resolve the issue of the surrender of the puppet troops in Yongnian according to the troop reorganization plan, to benefit the people. However, as soon as the group arrived at its destination, a serious divergence occurred regarding the issue of the group's station, causing the Yongnian surrender issue to remain at a standstill. This reporter specifically visited Colonel Zhao Haifeng, the CCP representative of the Yongnian group, in Nanqiao Town outside Yongnian City, and was informed as follows: "When the three parties' representatives of the Yongnian group departed from Handan for Yongnian on the 15th, they discussed the issue of the group's station. Our side believed that the group's station should be located in the liberated area outside the city, not in the county seat occupied by the puppet troops. This proposal was purely to maintain national integrity and dignity. Unexpectedly, after the Yongnian group arrived in Yongnian, the Guomindang representative and the US representative avoided discussing the surrender issue and insisted on moving into the city. In order to maintain national dignity, our side remained stationed outside the city and sent a letter to the Guomindang and US representatives on the 16th, requesting a prompt resolution to the station issue, and explaining that the 250,000 people in Yongnian County, originally only 20,000 in the city, were unable to live due to the puppet troops' cruel exploitation and extortion, and many had moved to our liberated area for relief and resettlement. Currently, there are only 3,000 people left in the city, and the rest are all puppet troops and their families. Based on the number of people, the group's station should also be in the liberated area. In addition, the puppet troops in the city claimed that they would execute our personnel, repeatedly threatened and insulted our liaison personnel, and continuously fired at our side, making it impossible to carry out work. Now I have telegraphed the Beiping Executive Headquarters to quickly resolve this issue, so that the work of the Yongnian group can proceed smoothly."
    [Handan, 17th Dispatch] After the Guomindang and US representatives of the Yongnian group entered Yongnian City on the afternoon of the 15th, the puppet troops in Yongnian immediately became rampant and suddenly began to fiercely fire on our defense lines at 9 o'clock the next day. Comrade Chen Fu, a platoon leader who went to the city on official business, was seriously wounded. Our army had no choice but to use machine guns for cover to pull the wounded back. The puppet troops continued to fire until 12 o'clock. It is also learned that Comrade Kang Kai, a liaison officer sent by our side to Yongnian City to contact the US and Guomindang representatives, was subjected to all kinds of threats and insults by the puppet troops when he passed through the East Gate on the 16th, claiming: "Now we have backers, you don't know what's good for you, we will execute you!" Upon learning this, our representative Colonel Zhao Haifeng immediately lodged a serious protest with the US and Guomindang representatives.

　　国美两方代表避谈受降问题
    永年伪军猖狂益甚
    保持民族尊严我代表坚主驻地应在解放区
    城内伪军竟仗势猛烈射击我防地
    【本报邯郸十七日讯】永年小组此次赴永，我方代表热诚希望能根据整军方案，立即解决永年伪军的受降问题，以造福人民，乃小组甫抵目的地，即因小组驻地问题发生严重分歧，以致永年受降问题仍处于停顿状态。记者特趋访永年小组中共代表赵海枫上校于永年城外之南桥镇，承告以如下：“永年小组三方代表于十五日由邯赴永时，曾商讨小组驻地问题，我方以小组驻地宜设于城外解放区，不宜设于伪军盘踞的县城，此项提议，乃纯为保持民族气节与尊严，不意永年小组抵永后，国方代表与美方代表竟对受降问题避而不谈，坚持要移驻城内，我方为维持民族之尊严，仍留驻城外，并于十六日致函国方与美方代表要求迅速解决驻地问题，并说明永年全县二十五万人，城内原不过两万，经伪军之残酷压榨勒索无法生活，而迁入我解放区获得救济与安置者甚多，目前城内人民已不过三千，其余全为伪军伪属，依人民多寡，小组驻地亦应在解放区。加以城内伪军声称：要枪毙我方人员，屡次威胁辱骂我方联络人员，并不断向我方射击，已无法进行工作。现我已电请北平执行部迅速解决此问题，以便永年小组工作顺利进行。
    【邯郸十七日电】永年小组国方代表与美方代表十五日下午进入永年城后，永年伪军立刻猖狂起来，突于翌日九点起开始向我防地猛烈射击，我因公赴城内的排长陈辅同志被击负重伤，我军不得已，以机枪掩护，始将伤号拉回。伪军一直射击至十二时始止。另悉：我方派赴永年城与美方及国方代表联络的联络员康凯同志于十六日出城经过东门时，曾备受伪军百般威胁辱骂，声称：“现在我们有了靠山，你们不识时务，就要枪毙你们！”我方代表赵海枫上校获悉，立刻向美方与国方代表提出严重抗议。
