　　Relief Group in Yongnian
    Fang De
    In the heart of southern Hebei, the Kuomintang reactionaries, after adding the title of "National Army" to the puppet troops in the isolated city of Yongnian, plotted to establish an anti-Communist civil war stronghold to support Anyang and Shijiazhuang from the north and south. This has been going on for nine months and ten days since the counter-offensive. Recently, the Kuomintang's news organs have continuously fabricated rumors that the disaster situation in Yongnian city is so serious that it is "almost at the point of 'exchanging children for food'," and have been scolding UNRRA and other relief agencies for not providing relief, attempting to cover up their illegal actions of providing grain to the puppet troops in the city in various ways.
    From May 2nd to May 22nd, such bizarre things appeared on this tarnished land of the motherland: Kuomintang military aircraft sent pancakes and ammunition from the sky to "relieve" 2,000 puppet troops and puppet organization personnel, 4,800 puppet family members, and a large number of war criminals. The traitors recently tore down half of the civilian houses in the southwest corner of the city and rushed to build an airport, so that the Kuomintang reactionaries could communicate with them more directly and provide more ammunition and food! The relief group, composed of eight representatives from UNRRA, CNRRA, and the Relief Sub-Committee of the Liberated Area, sent 122,000 jin of millet and 178,000 jin of corn to Yongnian from the ground to relieve the starving people remaining in the city and the refugees in the liberated areas on the outskirts of the city. In order to rescue them, the precious products of the people's blood and sweat in the liberated area were transported into the city. Hundreds of working people in the liberated area drove carts and pushed wheelbarrows from Linmingguan to the Tanxiapo on the bank of the Yongnian city river all day long under the scorching sun or heavy rain. Once, it rained continuously, and the road was so muddy that it took five days to travel forty-five li. They were covered in mud and even spent their travel expenses; however, thinking of rescuing their fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, they worked even harder, completing the transportation of 200,000 jin in one week during the second and third phases, shortening the time by half compared to the first phase.
    The people in the city have a saying to describe the "relief" provided by the Kuomintang reactionaries: "Now it is not people eating pancakes, but pancakes eating people!" Only those who live in the city can appreciate the true meaning of this sentence. Once, a package was thrown from an airplane and landed in a courtyard. As soon as it landed, it jumped up, broke through a hole in the wall, and went out! On May 15 alone, nine packages landed in the Catholic Church where the relief group was staying, and the number of holes in the roof increased from thirty to thirty-four. One package broke through Father Hui's roof, smashed the wooden bed, and knocked over the bookcase. Chen Gui, the 27-year-old Bao head of Jiu Bao in South Street, was beaten to death by a pancake, leaving behind a young wife and a child less than five months old who could not live. The small errand boy (sent by the traitor Yang Yicai) of the National United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) representative of the executive group was watching the plane circling in the sky one day on the roof when a package of pancakes hit his head in a flash, crushing the child into a pile of flesh, and the man and the pancake penetrated the roof and fell to the ground. Mr. Gong Wenlan, a 40+ year old gentleman from No. 12, Shuangguanmiao Street, had at least two holes in each of his forty-odd houses. On March 5th, a pancake broke his granddaughter, Gong Deyan's, right leg into three sections just before her wedding. The traitors, fearing exposure of the Kuomintang reactionaries' atrocities, did not allow her to leave the city for treatment until the relief group escorted her to our liberated area outside the city on May 17th.
    The people suffered such a tragedy, and the representatives of the liberated areas in the relief group could no longer sit idly by. Mr. Zhao Wei proposed to give them preferential relief. It is said that the puppet government is also "giving preferential relief" to these victims. The puppet government's method of "relieving pancake disasters" is to form a youth league of 180 people aged 15 to 40 in the city, specializing in picking up pancakes and burying people. They pick up pancakes almost twice a day and bury dead people twice a day. As long as you go to Tanxiapo and ask the refugees who have left the city to investigate the number of people who have died or been injured in this tragedy, they will tell you without hesitation: "More than twenty."
    The traitors attempted to plunder the grain that the group relieved to the people by over-reporting the population. When Yang presented the total population of the city to Mr. Heng Anshi, the UNRRA representative, he said it was fifty to sixty thousand; however, at a well organized meeting of gentry and businessmen on May 2nd, even the puppet town head only reported a rough estimate of 11,500 people. After the representatives of the liberated area proposed to examine the census and review the qualifications of the refugees, the traitors fabricated for five days, adding the common people, puppet troops, puppet family members, and even fabricated names to make up 6,370 people. The facts in Xiguan are enough to illustrate this: originally there were eleven able-bodied young adults, two children, and sixteen women, but they wrote seventy-seven people on the register.
    After the first distribution ended (on the 14th), it was discovered that puppet troops and puppet family members were fraudulently claiming grain. Yuan Jinming, the puppet county party secretary of No. 8 Jia, South Gate, East Guan Road, in addition to reporting the three members of his family in the city, also added his wife living outside the city. Li Shutang, a soldier in the puppet recruit camp in the fourth door on the west side of Miao Xishan Street, reported six people. There were twelve such cases with conclusive evidence and twenty-one people. The representatives of the liberated areas took into consideration the majority of the refugees and did not stop the distribution because of the traitors' conspiracy to seize grain, but only canceled their eligibility to receive grain and gave them a final warning.
    The people who fled outside the city were worried about their relatives and property remaining in the city. Taking advantage of the opportunity that the relief group was in the city, the puppet troops were unable to openly refuse them the opportunity to return to the city to visit relatives and take out clothes for the summer. The traitors immediately seized this opportunity and, on the pretext that the population in the city had increased, seized grain. In the final list of people to be relieved, they wrote thirty-one people, including sixteen who had already registered at the grain distribution station in the liberated area and continued to receive grain according to their households, eleven fabricated names, and four unknown. Judging from the statistics of the population entering and leaving the city from the 8th to the 20th alone, it is not difficult to understand the freedom there: 1,766 people entered the city from the liberated area to retrieve clothing and furniture, but the traitors only released 1,137 people. Zhang Sigong from West Street had to pay 10,000 yuan to the puppet troops in Jize who lived in Nanguan to get his mule out of the city to work in the fields! It is very difficult for real people to come out of the city. I asked a boatman why he didn't care about food and didn't go to Nanqiao (liberated area) to earn money. He told me desperately: "The two people who come out to raft have to find someone to guarantee them, and if no one guarantees them, they can't get out no matter what!" When the distribution was taking place, the representatives of the liberated areas went to see the distribution situation and reported the relief work to the refugees, and the representatives were followed by heavily armed traitor secret service teams. Mr. Guo Landun, the British representative of UNRRA, also said angrily: "The puppet troops salute the people of UNRRA and CNRRA, but when they see you, they still have police behind them (meaning surveillance), that won't work!" Please don't forget that this is still the time when the National United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) representative of the executive group is handling the freedom of entry and exit in the city!
    Now the people in the city are very clear. Whenever the representatives of the liberated area pass by them, they can often see the old ladies putting out their hands and making an eight-character gesture, saying: "If it weren't for this one coming, we wouldn't get any grain!"

　　救济小组在永年
    方德
    在冀南腹地，国民党反动派把永年孤城的伪军加上“国军”头衔，阴谋建立一个南北策应安阳和石家庄的反共内战据点，从反攻到现在已经九个月零十天了。最近国民党的新闻机关不断制造永年城内灾情严重到“几乎‘易子而食’”的谣言，骂联总及其他救济机关为什么不去救济，企图以此掩盖他多方接济城内伪军粮食的不法行为。
    从五月二日到二十二日，这块被玷污的祖国土地上出现了这么奇离的事情：国民党军用飞机从天上送大饼和弹药来“救济”城内两千个伪军伪组织人员，四千八百个伪属和大批的战犯。汉奸们最近在城西南角把半个城的民房拆光赶修机场，以便于国民党反动派和他们来往得更直接，弹药粮食供给更多些！联总、行总及解放区救济分会代表八人组成的救济小组从地上送十二万二千斤小米，十七万八千斤玉茭到永年救济残留城内的饥民，以及流亡在城郊解放区的难民。为了抢救他们，解放区人民血汗的宝贵产品运进城里去了。解放区成百的劳动人民整天在烈日或霪雨下赶着大车，推着小车从临ｍíｎｇ＠①关运送到永年城河边的覃下坡。有一次接连下大雨，路是这么泥泞，四十五里整整熬煎了五天。溅了满身浆泥还贴了盘费；可是想到抢救父老兄弟姊妹，他们却更卖力气，在第二、三期内一周就运完二十万斤，较第一期缩短一半时间。
    城里人民有一句描写国民党反动派“救济”他们的话：“如今不是人吃大饼，是大饼吃人！”只有在城里生活的人，才能体会这句话的真实滋味。有一次，一个包从飞机上扔下，落到一个院里，刚着地就跳起来，把墙穿一个窟窿钻出去了！仅五月十五这一天，落在救济小组住的天主教堂里就有九包，房上的窟窿由三十个增加到三十四个。有一个包打穿了惠神父的房顶，砸碎了木床，碰翻了书橱。南大街九保二十七岁的保长陈贵被大饼活活砸死，丢下了年青老婆和一个不到五个月的孩子没法生活。执行小组国美代表的小听差（汉奸杨异才派去的），有一天在房子上了望在天空盘旋的飞机，闪眼间一包大饼砸在头上，把个孩子压成了肉团，连人带饼穿透房顶落在地下。双关庙街门牌十二号龚文澜老先生四十多间房子，每一间至少是两个窟窿。三月五日大饼把他快出嫁的孙女龚德颜右腿砸成三节。汉奸们怕暴露国民党反动派的暴行，不让她出城医治，直到五月十七救济小组才把她护送到了城外我解放区。
    人民遭到这样的惨祸，救济小组中解放区代表再也不能坐视了，由赵为一先生提出从优救济他们。据说伪政府也在“从优救济”这些遭难的人们。伪政府“救济饼灾”的办法是：把城内十五至四十的一百八十人组成青年团，专事拾饼和埋人，差不多每天拾两次饼，也要埋两次死人。只要你到覃下坡去问出城难民调查遭这种惨祸而死伤的人数，他们便会不假思索地告诉你：“二十多了”。
    汉奸们企图用多报人口把小组救济人民的粮食掠夺去。杨逆向联总代表恒安石先生报告城内人口总数时说五六万；可是在五月二日一个被组织好了的绅商各界会议上，任凭伪镇长口报也只有一万一千五百人的概数，后经解放区代表提出迄册与审查难民资格后，汉奸们制造了五天，把老百姓、伪军伪属、连上捏造的假名才凑成了六千三百七十人。西关的事实就足够说明了：本来全体青壮年十一人，两个小孩，十六个妇女，但却在册子上写了七十七人。
    在第一次发放结束（十四日）后，发现了伪军伪属冒名领粮，东关路南门牌八甲九号的伪县委书记原金铭除报了在城内的三口外，还添上寄居城外的老婆。庙西山街路西第四个门里伪新兵营士兵李书堂报了六口。像这样确凿有证的就有十二家二十一口。解放区代表们顾念多数难民，没有因为汉奸的阴谋夺取粮食而停止发放，只是取消他们的领粮资格，给他们以最后警告。
    逃到城外的老百姓不放心留在城内的亲友和财产，借着这个救济小组在城内，伪军不便公开拒绝他们回城的机会，回到城内探视亲友，搬取过夏的衣服。汉奸们马上抓住这个机会，借口城内人口增加，夺取粮食，他们在最后一次送请救济的名单中，写了卅一人，其中有十六个已在解放区发粮站登记继续领粮按家的，十一个捏造的假名，四个未详。仅就八日到廿日出进城人口统计，也不难明白那里自由：自解放区进城取衣物家具的一千七百六十六人，汉奸们仅放出一千一百卅七人。西街张思恭牵个骡子出城做庄稼，还得给住南关的鸡泽伪军一万元买路钱！真正的老百姓在城里是很难出来的，我问一个船夫为什么顾不上嘴，不到南桥（解放区）哪有个活钱花呢？他绝望的告诉我：“出来撑筏的两个人都要找人连环保才行，没人连环保说得天能也出不来！”当发放时，解放区代表去看一看发放情形和向难民报告救济工作，代表后面还有提枪实弹的汉奸特务队跟着。联总代表英人郭兰敦先生也气愤的说：“伪军见了联总和行总的人敬礼，见了你们还巡捕后面（即盯梢之意），这不行的！”请读者不要忘记，这还是执行小组国美代表在城里办理出入自由的时候！
    现在城里的人民是很明白的，每当解放区代表从他们面前走过时，常常可以见到老太太们出出手比个八字说：“不是这个来，我们就得不到粮食！”
