　　People in Disaster
    A Glimpse of Xin Hui Under "Nationalist Army" Occupation
    Liu Min
    With the intrusion of the Nationalist troops into northern Henan, the peaceful and free life of the people in northern Henan has once again plunged into a dark sea of suffering.
    When this group of troops invaded the liberated areas of Xinxiang, Huixian, and Huojia, the enemy-puppet slavery system (the "Big Township System"), which had long been sentenced to death by the people, and the feudal shackles (the Baojia System of collective responsibility) that ruled the people, were the first to be restored. Under each big township's joint security, a group of special agent armed forces, organized by local ruffians, hooligans, and tyrannical bullies, fattened themselves. Coordinating with the Nationalist army's internal war offensives, they were like a pack of ferocious jackals, destroying the democratic governments elected by the people in each village, as well as the mass organizations themselves. In particular, the peasant associations and militias that led the masses in their liberation were the targets of their brutal bloodshed. The disasters suffered by the people in the past six months are impossible to count! According to an incomplete survey of nine villages in Huixian and four villages in Huojia in one month alone, 28 farmers were brutally murdered, including two women. The secretary of the village office in Dazancheng Village, Huixian, had his arms chopped off and was eventually shot! The mother of Chen Yuetian and Chen Zhaodian from Ying Village was cruelly strangled to death by Nationalist special agent hitmen, and her body was thrown into a well. Why did they hate them so much? Because the former was a member of the peasant association, who had once led the peasants in resolutely opposing traitors, and the latter was a family member of a revolutionary martyr. The most tragic encounter was that of Guo Fengde, a militiaman from Nanxiaoying. He was a hero who led the entire village in anti-special agent and anti-traitor activities during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now that the traitors and special agents have become "central dignitaries," Guo Fengde and his wife were buried alive because of this. Guo's property and houses were also completely confiscated...
    Cruel bloodshed and terror continue to be inflicted upon the people in the occupied areas. In every town and village in Xinxiang, Huojia, Huixian, and other places, the faces of millions of people are covered with sorrow. The Baojia system suffocates them. They want to escape, but the chain law blocks them. Recently, the Nationalist Party issued a "National Identification Card" with strict control. Anyone who does not wear the "Identification Card" is considered a "communist bandit" and will be killed. What is most strange is that in many areas, farmers still wear the "Good Citizen Certificates" issued by the enemy. The only slight difference is that a Nationalist Party emblem has been newly stamped on the "Good Citizen Certificates."
    These self-proclaimed "people-saving" troops have not considered the people's desire for peace. On the contrary, from the first day they invaded the liberated areas, they used bayonets to force the people to build fortifications for the civil war on a large scale. Going north from Xinxiang along the Pinghan Railway, many enemy-puppet bunkers that had been leveled by the people were rebuilt one by one. Some places have even increased by two or three times. There is one every one and a half miles. Within three months, twelve new bunkers were added to Qixian Chengguan, four were added to Dongfangdian, and five were added to Gaocun. Near Yuhe, Huixian, there are as many as fifteen to thirty large and small bunkers. Along with the construction of internal war fortifications and bunkers, slips for dispatching bricks, tiles, laborers, wood, etc., are like random arrows, viciously shooting at the people who yearn for peace. A village of sixty-two households in Boyu Township, a suburb of Jixian, was forced to dispatch 20,000 bricks and tiles, thirteen mud and wood craftsmen, one hundred laborers, thirteen large beams and purlins, forty wooden boards, 10,000 catties of firewood, 2,500 catties of military wheat, and 100,000 yuan in funds in two days. From then on, the people were so busy that they could not catch their breath. Only the bunkers and fortifications increased rapidly on the peasants' lovely land. The four acres of vegetable garden that the poor peasant Li Fengqun in Yutun, Huojia, depended on for a living were occupied by bunkers and trenches, and the owners of more than thirty households with three hectares of fertile land in Yaotun lost their homes because of this. Moreover, the people's houses, bricks, and trees near the villages in more villages were requisitioned. Going east from Huiyuhe, tens of miles of plains no longer see brick houses and green trees. A local folk song truly depicts the disasters of the people: "The bricks are all donated! The trees are all sawed off! The men are all conscripted! The land is all barren!"
    The War of Resistance Against Japan has been won. In the liberated areas, millions of peaceful people are carrying out a large-scale production movement and building on a large scale to quickly restore the wounds of the eight-year war. However, for the people of Xinhui and Huojia who live in the bunker grid, victory has not brought them anything. The "Nationalist Army" guarding the bunkers and the special agents scattered everywhere make them still enjoy the same suffering as during the war. Every day, the "Nationalist Army" has to go to the countryside to "clean up the countryside," saying that they are there to check on "bandits," but the houses that have been cleared are like those that have encountered the "mopping up" of the Japanese devils. All food and property are looted. After the "Nationalist Army" cleared the countryside in a large household in Hujiahuamu Village, three mules were taken away, and the eldest son was kidnapped. A peddler in Bali Village had 70,000 yuan in legal tender also "cleaned" away. The coal of five coal-pulling villagers in Zhongtang Village was robbed, and all five were shot. In the countryside cleanup, the women there also suffered an unprecedented catastrophe. According to a survey of nine villages in the fourth district of Huojia, there were very few women from good families who were not insulted by the "Nationalist Army." More than a dozen daughters-in-law from the wealthy Zhou Jiacai family were raped in turn by the "Nationalist Army" after the men of the family were driven out. The wife of the middle peasant Tang Baofu lived in a platoon of soldiers from the 85th Army of the Nationalist Party. Every night, this woman from a good family suffered inhuman rape. Once, the 85th Army in Baofen Temple had a more whimsical idea and pretended to hold a meeting. As a result, eleven young women in the meeting place were taken away. The "Nationalist Army" in the countryside cleanup had the same interest in catching chickens as the Imperial Army. They often went in groups of three or five to catch the chickens of ordinary people. Once in Zhangjiatun, I came across a platoon of soldiers from the 85th Army who were returning "victoriously," each with three or five fat chickens hanging on the tips of their guns. Looking closer at the village, soldiers holding knives and sticks were scattered in the courtyards and walls of the ordinary people. The whole village was frightened, and the three egg-laying hens of the poor peasant Wang Yuxing were all snatched away, which made the whole family cry for a long time. In addition, in the grid, there are also popular "four mores." That is, "more special agent black guns, more prostitutes, more gambling, and more opium." A folk song describes this world saying:
    "The Nationalist Army is the same as the Imperial Army,
    They rob and rob until everything is gone,
    They are fat,
    The people suffer from famine."
    Having traveled all over the "Nationalist Army" occupied areas in northern Henan, people from all walks of life have felt great disappointment in the Nationalist Party army. They eagerly look forward to the Eighth Route Army and the democratic government, because the heavy burden makes it impossible for them to live any longer. Yan Chunrong, a poor family member of a revolutionary martyr in Fangtai Village, Xinxiang, did not have any burden under the democratic government. Now, he has to bear five dou and five sheng of grain and 7,000 yuan in donations for repairing blockhouses in one month. Zhu Fajun, a middle peasant in Xiaozhancheng, Huixian, has eleven people and cultivates twenty-three mu of land. Under the democratic government, he had to bear a total of five dou of grain in two seasons. To pay the grain dispatched by the Nationalist Army, he has to pay as much as five shi. Yuan Qingyu, a rich peasant in Fangtai Village, Huojia, cultivates fifty mu of land and feeds three animals. Last summer, he harvested 23 shi of grain, and was levied 20 shi and 2 dou, accounting for 80% of his annual income. There are simply too many others who cannot live because of forced conscription!
    However, the people who have been tempered by the eight-year war are no longer sheep. They know how to wage a firm and unyielding struggle in order to strive for the early realization of their own peace and freedom. This power of the people will smash all the chains that rule the people. Now the people in these areas who cannot live have widely launched a movement to resist corvée and resist conscription and strike (repairing bunkers). People from all walks of life have eagerly shouted out their hopes. The wealthy households said:
    "Thinking of the Eighth Route Army,
    Looking forward to the Eighth Route Army,
    The Eighth Route Army will reduce the taxes."
    The broadest masses of working people said:
    "Thinking of the Eighth Route Army,
    Looking forward to the Eighth Route Army,
    The Eighth Route Army will reduce the rent."
    The evil civil war has made the Nationalist Party soldiers who do not want to be cannon fodder even more war-weary. One clear and moonlit night, on the Nationalist Party bunker line in Huojia, a sentry with a southern accent was humming a poignant and meaningful ditty.
    "The moon is curved, long and long,
    My hometown is in the south,
    Soldiers were originally for fighting the Japanese,
    Who knew they would be sent to the civil war battlefield.
    …………………
    …………………
    Being cannon fodder, fighting the civil war, I won't do things that lose my conscience!
    Being cannon fodder, fighting the civil war, I won't do things that lose my conscience!"

　　灾难中的人们
    新辉获“国军”侵占区剪影
    柳敏
    随着侵入豫北的国民党军队，豫北人民和平自由的生活，又随入黑暗的苦海了。
    当这批队伍侵入新乡、辉县、获嘉一带解放区时，早为人民宣判死刑的敌伪奴役制度（大乡制），与统治人民的封建镣铐（保甲制连坐法），首先被恢复起来，每个大乡联保下面，都养肥着一批由地痞流氓、狗腿恶霸组织起来的特务武装，配合着内战进攻的国民党军队，真像一群凶暴的豺狼，破坏着各村人民自己选举的民主政权，以及群众自己的团体，特别是领导群众翻身的农会和民兵，更是他们残酷血洗的对象。半年多来人民所受的灾难再也无法统计了！仅据辉县九个村、获嘉四个村一月不完全的调查，就有二十八位农民遭惨杀，其中两人是妇女。辉县大赞城村村公所书记，被砍去了两臂，最后被枪杀了！一位营村陈月田与陈照典的母亲，被国民党特务黑枪手残酷的勒死了，并把尸体投入了井底，为何他们如此仇恨他们呢？因为前者是农会会员，曾经领导农民，坚决反对过汉奸，后者因为是抗属。遭遇最惨的，是南小营的民兵郭凤得，他是抗战期间领导全村反特务反汉奸的英雄，现在汉奸特务成了“中央贵人”了，郭凤得与他的老婆，便因之被活埋了。郭的家产房屋，亦全部被没收……
    残酷的血洗和恐怖，继续加诸占领区的人民。在新乡、获嘉、辉县等地的每个村镇，千千万万人民的脸上，都为愁容所笼罩了。保甲制窒息着他们。想逃走吧，连锁法封锁住他们。最近国民党又发行了一种统治严密的“国民身份证”，谁没有佩带“身份证”谁就被认为“奸匪”，而遭到杀害。其中最使人奇怪的，是很多地区，农民仍佩带着敌人发给的“良民证”，稍为不同的只是“良民证”上，新加盖了一个国民党党徽。
    这些自命“救民”的军队，并没有顾及人民和平的渴望。恰相反，他们从侵入解放区的第一天起，即用刺刀强逼着人民大肆修筑内战的碉堡，从新乡顺着平汉路北走，曾被人民平毁的许多敌伪碉堡，又一一被修筑起来。有些地方更增了两三倍。每隔一里半远，就有一个。在淇县城关三月内就增修了十二个新碉堡，在东坊店添修了四个，在郜村添修了五个。辉县峪河附近，大小碉堡即筑有十五个至三十个之多。随着内战工事碉堡的修筑，派砖、派坯、派夫、派木料等的条子，就像乱箭一样，恶毒的射在渴望和平的人民身上。汲县城郊伯玉乡一个六十二户人家的村庄，在两天内，就强派了砖坯两万块，泥木工匠十三名，民夫一百名，大梁檩条十三根，木板四十块，木柴一万斤，军麦二千五百斤，派款十万元。从此，人民忙得喘不过气来，只见在农民可爱的土地上，碉堡工事迅速增多了。获嘉峪屯贫农栗凤群，四亩赖以为生的菜园都被碉堡壕沟所占住，姚屯三顷良田的三十余户主人因之失掉了家园。而更多村庄的民房，砖头以及村庄附近的树木，更是抢征一光。从辉峪河东行，数十里的平原，已再看不见砖房和绿树，当地有一首民谣真是灾难人民的深刻的写照：“砖头捐光啦！树木锯光啦！男人支光啦！土地全荒啦！”
    抗战胜利了。在解放区，千千万万和平的人民，正开展大生产运动，大兴土木，以迅速恢复八年战争创伤，可是生活在碉堡格子网内的新获辉人民，胜利却并未带给他们什么，守望在碉堡内的“国军”，和散布各地的特务，使他仍然享受着战争期间一样的苦难，每天“国军”却要下乡来“清乡”，说是来盘查“土匪”，但是经过清查的人家，就好象遭遇过日寇的“扫荡”一样，一切粮食财物都被洗劫一光。辉嘉滑木村一家大户，在“国军”清乡后，三个骡子被牵走了，大儿子被绑票了。八里村一位小贩，七万元法币也被“清”缴了。中堂村五个拉煤老乡的煤被抢走了，五人全被枪毙了。在清乡中，那里的妇女们也遭受着空前的浩劫，据获嘉四区九个村的调查，良家妇女，很少不被“国军”侮辱的，大户周家财家闺女媳妇十余人，被“国军”将全家男人赶出后，即实行了轮奸，中农唐保富之妻，家里住着国民党八十五军一排的士兵，每天晚上，这位良家妇女，即遭受着惨无人道的轮奸，有一次包分庙的八十五军更异想天开，假装以开会为名，结果会场中十一位青年妇女，便被拉走了。清乡中的“国军”和皇军一样有着捕鸡的兴趣，他们经常三五成群去捕捉老百姓的鸡子，有一次在张家屯我曾碰着一排八十五军的士兵，正“胜利”归来，每人的枪尖上，都挂着三五只肥鸡。再走近村一看，老百姓院里墙上，还散布着拿刀执棍的士兵，整个村里吓得鸡飞狗跳，贫农王玉兴三只下蛋的母鸡，便被一拥抢光了，气得全家大哭了半天。此外，在格子网内，还流行着“四多”。那就是“特务黑枪多、破鞋多、赌博多、大烟料子多。”民间有首歌谣描写这种世道说：
    “国军皇军一个样，
    抢来抢去一齐光，
    他们吃胖了，
    百姓遭饥荒”。
    走遍了豫北“国军”侵占区各地，各种不同阶层的人们，他们已对国民党军队，感到极大的失望，他们极切的盼望着八路军和民主政府，因为苛重的负担，使他们再也不能生活了，新乡方台村穷苦抗属阎春荣，民主政府时，完全不负担，现在一月即负担修炮楼粮五斗五升捐款七千元，辉县小占城中农朱法君，十一口人，种二十三亩地，对民主政府两季负担粮共五斗，交国民党军派粮，即达五石，获嘉方台村富农袁清玉，种五十亩地，喂三头牲口，去夏收粮二十三石，即被征派二十石二斗，占全年收入百分之八十。其他因强征而不能生活者，那简直是太多了！
    但是经过八年战争锻炼的人民，他们已再不是绵羊，他们知道为争取自己和平自由的早日实现，应如何坚定不屈的进行斗争。这种人民的力量，将会把统治人民的一切锁链，打得粉碎。现在这些地区无法生活的人民，已广泛的开展了抗差抗征与怠工（修堡）运动。各种不同阶层的人，都渴望的喊出了自己的希望，富户们说：
    “想八路，
    盼八路，
    八路来了少出赋。”
    最广大的劳动人民说：
    “想八路，
    盼八路，
    八路来了能减租。”
    罪恶的内战，使不愿作炮灰的国民党士兵，厌战情绪也更加高涨。一个风清月明的晚上，在获嘉国民党碉堡线上，一个南方口音的哨兵，在凄切的哼着意味深长的小调。
    “月儿湾湾长又长，
    我的家乡在南方，
    当兵原是为的打日本，
    谁知开到内战场。
    …………………
    …………………
    当炮灰，打内战，丧掉良心的事儿我不干！
    当炮灰，打内战，丧掉良心的事儿我不干！”
