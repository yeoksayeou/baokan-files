　　Central News Agency Shamelessly Fabricates Rumors, Accusing Us of Sending Planes to Attack Taiyuan Airport
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th, preposterously claimed: "The CCP sent planes to attack Taiyuan Airport," which is purely delusional and a shameless fabrication. If Taiyuan Airport is attacked by planes, there is no other explanation besides the Kuomintang authorities playing tricks themselves. Such malicious rumors are nothing more than an attempt to cover up the provocative behavior of the Kuomintang fascist faction, which has been continuously using American-made planes in the Northeast to conduct large-scale civil war in recent weeks, and conducting strafing and reconnaissance in the cities of the Central Plains, Jinji-Luyu, Jin-Chahar-Hebei, Jehol, Jin-Sui, and even the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Areas.

　　中央社无耻造谣诬我派机袭击太原飞机场
    【新华社延安十九日电】中央社太原十八日讯，妄称：“中共派机袭击太原飞机场”，纯属梦呓无耻造谣，太原飞机场如有飞机袭击，除了国民党当局自己玩把戏以外，别无其他方法可以解释，此类恶毒谣言，无非欲以掩盖国民党法西斯派近旬来不断利用美造飞机在东北进行大规模内战，中原、晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀、热河、晋绥以至陕甘宁解放区城市进行扫射和侦察的挑衅行为。
