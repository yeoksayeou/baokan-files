　　Northwestern Associated University Student Movement Expands
    Fascist Reactionaries Actually Suppress It
    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Xi'an News: The Northwestern Associated University student movement has further expanded. The authorities actually dispatched a large number of military police and secret agents on the 24th of last month to close the four gates of Chenggu, searching and arresting students of the university. At the beginning of last month, after West University students launched a movement to expel Liu Jihong for ordering the dissolution of the student self-government association, Liu illegally appropriated 20 million yuan of public funds, attempting to starve the entire student body. On the 19th, he instructed special agents Zhang Zizheng, Liang Shangde, and General Affairs Director Guo Junshi, along with more than 30 others, to carry dozens of pistols and organize a so-called "School Protection Corps." With the assistance of local military police, they surrounded the West University Faculty of Law and Commerce, carrying out mass arrests and forcing students to join the "School Protection Corps." The Faculty of Law and Commerce students rose up in resistance, and some students broke through the military police encirclement and rushed out of the school gate. Special agent Sun Qi@ and others opened fire in pursuit. Because some students were still surrounded in the school, the pursued students turned back and called for their release. At this time, students from the main campus also came to inquire. The special agents then tightly closed the school gate, firing shots and throwing bricks and stones indiscriminately. On the 24th, the Chenggu military police, in coordination with the university, announced martial law throughout the city. Led by the special agents, military police went to student dormitories and public places to carry out mass arrests. It is reported that the main members of the self-government association have mostly been arrested.

　　西北联大学潮扩大
    法西斯反动派竟施镇压
    【新华社延安二十日电】西安讯：西北联大学潮更加扩大，当局竟于上月二十四日拨派大批军警特务，将城固四门紧闭，搜捕该校学生。上月初，西大同学因反对校长刘季洪勒令解散自治会，掀起驱刘运动后，刘竟非法提用公款两千万元，企图把全校学生活活饿死，并于十九日指示特务学生张子正、梁尚德及庶务主任郭君实等三十余人，携带几十枝手枪，组织所谓“护校团”，在当地军警协助下，包围西大法商学院，大举捕人，并强迫学生参加“护校团”。法商学生纷起反抗，一部分学生并突破军警包围，冲出校门，特务孙其＠等竟开枪追击，被追击的学生因尚有同学被围在校，乃回头呼吁释放，时值校本部学生亦往探问，特务等复紧闭校门，大肆鸣枪，乱掷砖石。至二十四日，城固军警又配合该校宣布全城戒严，由特务领着军警，分赴学生宿舍及公共场所，大举捕人，闻自治会主要分子多已被捕。
