　　Human Hell - Yongnian City
    Fang De
    The "Record of Compatriots Trapped in Yongnian City," published in the Beiping Huabei Daily on May 5th, uses the words of traitors entrenched in Yongnian City, disguising them as the voice of the "people" to deceive the masses. Now, let me bring the voice of the people's accusations to the readers:
            One: Flooding and Siege, Sucking Marrow
    The veteran traitors who have been massacring the people of Southern Hebei for eight years, including Tie Motou (许铁英 Xu Tieying), the commander of the puppet Southern Hebei Jing'an Independent Brigade, Wang Zemin, the deputy commander of the puppet Yongnian Security Joint Force, and Wang Guanwu, the captain of the puppet Jize County Security Brigade, have been entrenched in Yongnian City since the enemy surrendered.
    When Wang Guanwu took over from Wang Zemin and entrenched himself in Dongqiao Village (five li east of the city) on September 19th, in order to prevent our army from liberating Yongnian City, Wang Guanwu breached the Puyang River openings on the north and south sides of the village, leading water into the moat. Before the flooding, the main roads from the four gates outside the city to the city were also dug into deep trenches like the moat, cutting off the connection between the gates and the city. The city became the center, and the water surface was three to five li wide. The gates and the city were like five isolated islands submerged in the surrounding 45-li small lake. Fifteen thousand mu of fertile land in the surrounding nineteen villages were turned into lakebeds, and the people trapped in the city could no longer get out!
    In the small city of 25,000 people, the amount of money extorted before the New Year reached 1.8 million yuan. Wealthy merchants were continuously forced to donate. The donation slips filled baskets, and tax collectors crowded the doors. Fan Boxi on Beidajie was forced to donate 7 million, and Guo Lansun, the owner of Taiji on Nandajie, was forced to death. The total amount of donations from wealthy households reached 9 million. The bones of the people in the city were crushed. As many as 300 people were forced to death because they could not afford the burden. During the Lunar New Year, the puppet troops even more frantically looted the remaining grain of the people. For example, when the five families of Xi Ji on Tupo Street were not found to have grain, his wife was dragged to the pillbox and gang-raped. During the New Year period, as many as 50 people died of starvation every day. Now, the surviving people are still burdened with 20 million "circulation coupons," and prices are rising so terribly. Last December, an egg cost 70 yuan, but by April of this year, it had risen to 500 yuan. Now, 800 yuan can only buy a two-tael sesame seed cake.
            Two: People Starve, Traitor Pigs Fatten
    From the beginning of February this year, Kuomintang transport planes have been delivering grain to support the puppet troops in the city. Only their "National Army" and Yang Yicai and his like, who used to be enemies' county magistrates but are now officials of the Kuomintang government, get the large flatbreads dropped from the sky. The people in the city get nothing. A refugee from Huopai Shijie who escaped to Dongqiao complained bitterly: a flatbread smashed the house and fell into the home. He was so hungry that he picked up some flatbread crumbs to eat and was beaten severely. The gifts the people received from the Kuomintang transport planes were: people were killed by the flatbreads, and houses were smashed. Now, according to the reporter, three people have died from such misfortune, and nine out of ten houses have been smashed.
    Two planes fly over the city every day, threatening the lives and homes of the people twice a day. On average, five planes supply 15,000 jin of flatbread every day. There are only 2,000 active puppet troops and members of puppet organizations, and 4,800 dependents. These pigs eat their fill, while nearly 6,000 people are starving. Although the traitors use hunger to threaten them to join their ranks, many people with national integrity would rather die than submit!
    In the city, you can see two kinds of people: one is the refugees who are yellow-faced and emaciated, with sunken eyes, lying by the street with only a breath left, or those who are gathering algae by the water's edge to survive, struggling towards death. The other is men and women with ruddy complexions. You can't find a trace of hunger on these people! Wang Zemin even uses 200 jin of flatbread every day to feed his three fat pigs and more than forty piglets. In the still of the night, you can hear the barking of the officials' fat dogs; at dawn, you can hear the rooster crowing!
    There is no land in the city, and the people have no vegetables to eat, and many suffer from night blindness and hemorrhagic diseases. But the traitors can eat cod liver oil and canned beef sent from airplanes!
            Three: Rescue
    The city walls of Yongnian are as flat as the Puyang Riverbed. In order to rescue the people, the Eighth Route Army, at the request of the people, captured Dongqiao on the morning of November 28th and immediately blocked the breach in the afternoon. Therefore, the river water did not rise to the city gate. On December 1st, the democratic government mobilized 2,623 people from the liberated areas to dig drainage ditches, and later rescued the people from the city to land from the water.
    The people could no longer survive. On February 14th, there was a spontaneous struggle to leave the city. The traitors were also trying to release a group of consuming population, so they released more than 5,000 unarmed old, weak, women, and children, while detaining the able-bodied men who supported these people, to continue to enslave and exploit them, and attempted to starve the women and children to death in the liberated areas!
    The puppet troops' small rafts had just ferried the old, weak, women, and children across half a li of water, when, on the pretext of fearing that the Eighth Route Army would detain the boats, they pushed them all into the water one by one. The water was deep and the road was long. For a time, only a cry of sorrow could be heard on the broad water surface. Three people were drowned alive in Beiguan. The Eighth Route Army soldiers, who were eagerly waiting on the shore, jumped into the icy water to rescue them, regardless of their own safety. Some of them could no longer speak. The democratic government lit a big fire in Dangtou Village to bake them and cooked porridge to feed them. Their bodies warmed up, and their stomachs heated up, before they could speak and stand up. The government also gave each of them ten jin of emergency relief rice and introduced them to live in nearby villages. The second time, on March 11th, the task force brought out more than 3,000 people. Together with those who had escaped at ordinary times, there were a total of 18,000 people. Among them, 8,000 people who had no ability to survive received government relief.
    The government led them to make straw waistcoats, weave cattail fans, knit nets, and do small businesses, earning up to 100 yuan a day. Their household chores have been initially established, but they are not doing well enough. Therefore, they still have serious difficulties!
            Four: What Do They Need?
    What do they need?
    Wang Zuoxin, a 60-year-old representative from Beijie who came to the liberated area to receive relief grain, said: "The people in the city need to come out! But the traitors won't let them!" His old tears accompanied his low voice to the ground... Chen Shanzhu, a small boatman from Dongguan, told me that although three people had drowned, people still swam out of the city at night from Dongmen to escape to the liberated area.
    Zhang Yinzheng, from the entrance of Beidajie Road West, and his three brothers were forced to become puppet soldiers. His third brother died of injuries last year. He understood that this disaster was given to them by the traitors. In mid-April, the two brothers successively escaped from the city, swam to the liberated area, and handed over their guns to the Eighth Route Army. The puppet soldiers in Jize, Nanguan, had long asked to be disarmed and return to farming. But until now, they are still being ruled and driven by the puppet military leaders who kill without blinking an eye.
    On May 1st, when I arrived at Nanqiao in the liberated area, I saw that among the hundred people brought out of the city by Mr. Heng Anshi, an American from the relief team, there were seventeen children and eighty-three women. The refugees standing on the shore looked at the city, and hundreds of hearts hoped that their children and husbands would come out to support them. However, the traitors were unwilling to release one!

　　人间地狱——永年城
    方德
    北平华北日报五月五日发表《永年城同胞被困记》一篇通讯，把盘踞永年城的汉奸们的话，借“人民”的口吻说出来欺骗人民。现在，让我将人民控诉的声音带给读者：
            一  放水围困，敲骨吸髓
    残杀冀南人民八年的老牌汉奸伪冀南靖安独立旅长铁磨头（即许铁英）、伪永年保安联队副王泽民及伪鸡泽县保安大队长王冠五，从敌人投降到现在，就一直盘踞着永年城。
    当王冠五九月十九接替王泽民盘踞东桥村（城东五里）时，为了阻止我大军解放永年城，王冠五在村南北两面决开滏阳河口，引水灌入护城河，灌水前把城外四关通至城内的大道也挖成和城河一样的横断深沟，切断关城的联系，以城为中心，水面宽到三华里到五华里，关和城像五个孤岛沉在周围四十五华里的小湖里。周围十九个村的一万五千亩良田变成了湖底，被水围在城里的人民再也出不来了！
    二万五千人的小城在年前被强征款项达一百八十万元之多，不断强征富商大贾，他们捐条满筐，税丁盈门，北大街范伯西被强捐七百万，南大街泰记老板郭兰荪被捐逼死。综计富户捐款达九百万。城内人民骨头都榨碎了，因负担不起而被逼死的达三百人之多。伪军在旧历年关更疯狂搜掠人民仅存的余粮，如土坡街席集五家没搜出粮食，他老婆就被抓到炮楼上轮奸。在年关期中被逼死饿死的每天有五十人之多；现在在仅存的活人身上还负担二千万“流通券”，物价涨得这么可怕：去年十二月一个鸡蛋七十元，到今年四月就涨到五百元。现在八百元只能买一个二两重的烧饼。
            二  人民肚饥，汉奸猪肥
    从今年二月一开始，国民党的运输机就输送粮食接济城里的伪军了。投下的大饼只有他们的“国军”和曾是敌人的县长，而今是国民党政府的命官杨异才之流才有份，在城里的人民是得不到什么的，火牌什街一个逃到东桥的难民哭诉着：饼砸塌了房子，掉在家里，饿得慌了拾点儿饼屑来吃还挨了一顿毒打。人民所得国民党运输机的赐予是：人被大饼砸死，房子被砸破，现在，据记者所知受到这种不幸灾祸而致死的已有三个，十家有九家的房子都被砸破了。
    每天两趟飞机飞临上空，人民的生命和房屋也就受到两次威胁。平均每天五架飞机供应一万五千斤大饼，现役伪军伪组织人员只有两千，伪属四千八百，这些猪吃胀破了肚皮，而近六千的人民却在挨饿，汉奸们虽用饥饿来威胁他们入伙；但许多富有民族气节的人民却宁死不屈！
    在城里可以看见两种人：一种是面黄饥瘦，眼睛深陷，躺在街旁只剩一口气的灾民，或者在水边捞水藻过生活、向死亡挣扎的人们。另一种却是肤色丰润的男女，在这种人身上找不着一点饥饿的形色！王泽民每天还用二百斤大饼喂他的三口肥猪和四十多个猪娃，夜深人静时，还可以听到官家肥狗的狂吠；黎明还可以听到公鸡唱晓！
    城里没有二分地，人民没菜吃，多害鸡宿眼和破血病；可是汉奸们却能吃到从飞机上送来的鱼肝油和罐头牛肉！
            三  抢救
    永年城楼和滏阳河床一样平，八路军为了抢救人民，在十一月二十八日午前应人民之请攻克东桥，午后就抢堵了决口。所以河水没有上升到城门口。十二月一日，民主政府又发动解放区群众二千六百二十三人抢挖排水沟，以后从水里把城内人民抢救到陆地上来。
    人民再也活不下去了，在二月十四来了一次自发的出城斗争。汉奸们也正在想法要推出一批消费的人口，所以就放出五千多赤手空拳的老弱妇孺，而把养活这些人的青壮年全都扣留下来，供他们继续奴役剥削，并企图把妇孺们饿死在解放区里！
    伪军的小筏子刚把老弱妇孺们渡过半里多远的水面，借口怕八路军扣留船只就一个个都推下水去，水深路远，广阔的水面上一时只听得一片哀号，北关就活活淹死了三个，在岸边殷殷守候的八路军战士们，奋不顾身，纷纷跳入刺骨的水里把他们救起来，他们已经有一部分人不能说话了。民主政府在党头村烧了大火给他们烤，煮了稀饭喂到他们嘴里。他们的身上暖了，肚里热了，才能说出话来，才能站得起来。政府又发给他们每人十斤急赈米，介绍他们到附近村子居住，第二次是三月十一执行小组把他们带出了三千多，连平时逃出来的一共综计有一万八千人。其中没有生存能力而得到政府救济的达八千人。
    政府领导他们搓草腰，编蒲扇，织网子，作小生意，每天可以获得百元以内的收入，他们家务已初步建立起来；但作得还不够好，因此，他们还存在严重的困难！
            四  他们需要什么？
    他们需要什么呢？
    一个出城来解放区领救济粮的北街代表六十老人王作新说：“城里人需要出来！可是汉奸不让啊！”龙钟老泪伴随着他低沉的声音落在地上……东关小船夫陈珊珠告诉我虽已淹死了三个人，但东门每天晚上还是有人泅水出城，逃到解放区来。
    北大街口路西张印证弟兄三个都被迫当了伪军，他三弟在去年受伤死去，他明白这个灾祸是汉奸们赐予的，四月中旬弟兄两个先后坠城泅水到解放区把枪交给了八路军，住南关鸡泽的伪军们早就要求解除武装，归田务农；可是直到现在，他们仍被杀人不眨眼的伪军头子们继续统治驱使着。
    五月一日我到达解放区的南桥，看到救济小组的美国人恒安石先生从城里带出的百人中，有十七个小孩，八十三个女人和站在岸边的难民们看着城里，成百的心期待着她们的孩子、丈夫出来养活他们，可是，汉奸们并不愿放出一个！
