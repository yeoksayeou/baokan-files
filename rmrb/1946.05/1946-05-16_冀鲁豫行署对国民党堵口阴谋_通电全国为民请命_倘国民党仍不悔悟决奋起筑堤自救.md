　　JiluYu Administrative Office Protests Kuomintang's Damming Conspiracy
    Appeals to the Nation for the People
    Vowing to Rise Up and Build Dikes to Save Themselves if the Kuomintang Does Not Repent
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 12th] The JiluYu Administrative Office, concerned that the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined to release water and drown the people of the entire region, has issued an urgent appeal to the nation on behalf of the people. The original telegram is as follows:

    To Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Zhang of the Democratic League, the Political Consultative Conference Subcommittee, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils of all provinces and cities, the Fellow Countrymen Associations of JiluYu Provinces in various places, all legal entities, and compatriots across the country: Since the proposal to return the Yellow River to its old course, the people of all counties along the river in this region have been shocked and frightened. In addition to providing comfort in many ways, this government has sent representatives to negotiate with the Yellow River Commission stationed in Kaifeng and to participate in the survey by the Yellow River Commission survey team, resulting in the clear decision on April 15 to first dredge the river and restore the dikes before damming the breach in the Yellow River at Huayuankou – the Heze Agreement. However, after this government began preparations in accordance with the agreement, the Kuomintang authorities first instructed the Central News Agency to spread rumors, deliberately distorting the content of the agreement, then ordered the Yellow River Commission to speed up the damming of the breach, and are now actively preparing to close the breach and release water. This is closely related to the Kuomintang's active preparations to re-ignite the civil war and is actually part of the Kuomintang's military conspiracy to attack our JiluYu region, forcing approximately 12 million people in our entire border area to suffer the tragedy of civil war and floods again. This government, acting on behalf of the people, in addition to sending representatives to continue negotiating with the Kuomintang authorities and the Yellow River Commission to seek compromise, also issues a sincere and urgent appeal to the nation. We earnestly request all democratic parties, legal entities, fellow countrymen associations of JiluYu provinces in various places, and people of justice from all walks of life to urgently take effective measures for the sake of the lives of 12 million people in the JiluYu border region and to stop the civil war and maintain peace, so as to stop this disastrous and evil scheme of the Kuomintang reactionaries that harms the country and the people. This government is determined to lead the people of the entire region to fight to the death to achieve the implementation of the Heze Agreement. If the Kuomintang authorities still do not repent, the people of this region will not sit idly by and wait to be drowned, but will rise up to build dikes and save themselves. Compelled by circumstances, it is difficult to remain silent. This is reported to you. JiluYu Administrative Office Director Dong Junyi, Deputy Director Jia Xinzai, respectfully.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 12th] The JiluYu Daily published an article on the 8th titled "Mobilize to Build Dikes and Save Ourselves," which stated in part: The Heze Agreement, which stipulates that the dikes be restored before the breach is dammed, is a fair conclusion and correct policy obtained from on-site surveys by Chinese hydraulic engineers and the Liberated Area government, and has therefore won the support of the broad masses of the people in the Liberated Areas. However, the plan of the Kuomintang authorities is exactly the opposite. They not only want to impose the Yellow River disaster on the people of the Liberated Areas, but also want to cleverly blame the Liberated Area government, using accusations of "being able to act but not acting" and "deliberately obstructing" to cover up their crimes. Now the Kuomintang is planning a huge military conspiracy, planning to take advantage of the Yellow River's flooding to launch a large-scale invasion of the Liberated Areas. We must not be paralyzed. We must recognize that the Kuomintang authorities, who are vicious, insidious, and inherently rogue-like, are capable of doing anything. The situation is already very clear. The Kuomintang authorities are now stepping up the damming project at Huayuankou and are about to use the Yellow River to drown the soldiers and civilians of our North China Liberated Areas. The only way out is to implement self-salvation. We must block the water from coming north. The people of the entire border area, regardless of rich or poor, male or female, old or young, must all mobilize to build dikes and save ourselves, and not allow the Yellow River to flood in. Time is already very urgent. We call on the people of the entire region to urgently mobilize. Building dikes and saving ourselves is the only way out. We demand that compatriots across the country and people around the world uphold justice, stop the Kuomintang authorities' vicious conspiracy, immediately stop damming the breach, and implement the Heze Agreement.

　　冀鲁豫行署对国民党堵口阴谋
    通电全国为民请命
    倘国民党仍不悔悟决奋起筑堤自救
    【新华社荷泽十二日电】冀鲁豫行署以国民党反动派决心放水淹溺全区人民，顷特为民请命，致电全国，发出紧急呼吁。原电如下：
    中共毛主席、民主同盟张主席，政协小组委员会、联合国救济总署、各省市县参议会、各地冀鲁豫三省同乡会、各法团暨全国同胞公鉴：黄河归故倡议以来，本区沿河各县群情惊骇，本府除多方抚慰外，并派代表与黄委会交涉驻开封商谈及黄委会勘察团之勘察而有四月十五日明确决议先浚河复堤而后堵口之荷泽协议，讵后当本府方面按照协议进行准备工作之际，国民党当局首先指使中央社造谣，故意歪曲协议内容，继则限令黄委会加紧堵口，现又积极准备合龙放水，此与目前国民党积极准备重新挑起内战密切有关，实为国民党向我冀鲁豫进攻之军事阴谋的一部分，逼使我全边约一千二百万人民重罹内战与洪水之惨祸。本府为民请命，除再派代表与国民党当局及黄委会委曲求全继续商谈外，并向全国发出诚恳的紧急呼吁，敢请各民主政党、法团、各地冀鲁豫三省同乡会及各界正义人士，为冀鲁豫边区一千二百万人民生命计，为制止内战维护和平计，共同急起，采取有效办法，制止国民党反动派此种祸国殃民之阴谋毒计。本府决率领全区人民，誓死力争荷泽协议之实现，倘国民党当局仍不默然悔悟，本区人民将不甘坐待淹毙，决奋起筑堤，挡水自救，实逼处此，难以缄默，特此电闻。冀鲁豫行署主任董君毅、副主任贾心斋叩。
    【新华社荷泽十二日电】冀鲁豫日报八日以《动员起来筑堤自救》为题著论，略称：规定先复堤后堵口的荷泽协议，是中国水利工程师与解放区政府实地勘察所得的公正结论和正确方针，因而取得解放区广大人民的拥护。但国民党当局的计划却真正相反，他们不仅想将黄灾加诸解放区人民身上，更想巧妙地加罪于解放区政府，以“能为而不为”和“故意阻挠”的罪名以掩饰其罪恶，现国民党正在策划着一个巨大的军事阴谋，策划着随黄水之汜滥而向解放区大举进犯，我们不能麻痹，我们要认清毒辣阴险流氓成性的国民党当局是什么事都干得出来的。事情已经非常明白，国民党当局现正加紧进行在花园口的堵口工程，就要用黄河来淹死我华北解放区军民，只有实行自救，我们要阻水北来，全边区的人民不问贫富男女老幼，一齐动员起来，筑堤自救，不让黄水浸入。时间已经非常迫切，我们号召全区人民紧急动员起来，只有筑堤自救，才是出路。我们要求全国同胞，全世界人士，主持正义，制止国民党当局的毒辣阴谋，立即停止堵口，执行荷泽协议。
