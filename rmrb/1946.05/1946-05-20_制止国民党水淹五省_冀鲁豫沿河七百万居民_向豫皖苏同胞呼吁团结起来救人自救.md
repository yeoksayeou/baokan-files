　　【Xinhua News Agency, Handan】The seven million people in eighteen counties along the old course of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region have issued an appeal to their compatriots in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, urging them to jointly prevent the Kuomintang reactionaries' plot to flood five provinces. The full text is as follows:

　　To our fellow compatriots in the provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, south of the Yellow River:

　　Since the Kuomintang breached the Yellow River in 1938 (民国二十七年) and diverted its course southward, you have suffered the pain of Yellow River floods for eight years. We deeply sympathize with you. "All people under heaven are one family." Therefore, we do not oppose the Yellow River returning to its old course. However, you must understand that we have suffered from Yellow River floods for thousands of years. From 1913 (民国二年) to 1937 (民国二十六年) alone, the Yellow River breached its banks twelve times, drowning countless elders, brothers, sisters, and destroying countless fields, houses, and properties. Especially after the War of Resistance Against Japan, we have suffered eight years of enemy disaster and two years of natural disaster, causing deep wounds. Moreover, the dikes along the old course have been largely destroyed. If they are not repaired first and the water is suddenly diverted north, we will face the catastrophe of all the land becoming a swamp and all the people becoming fish. Therefore, we have repeatedly demanded that the Kuomintang government first repair the dikes and dredge the river, and then block the breach and release the water. During the construction, they should also repair the dikes along the new course to prevent the flooded area from expanding and actively provide relief to the vast number of disaster-stricken people in the new flooded area. Although many negotiations have been held and agreements have been reached, they have all been overturned by the Kuomintang. Recently, they have disregarded the opinions and lives and property of our thirty million people, completely ignoring the dike repair and river dredging projects, as well as the relocation and relief efforts. They are only accelerating the blocking of the Huayuankou breach, aiming to close it and release the water by the end of this month to coordinate their military operations, attack our liberated areas, and destroy our people. Compatriots! Can we seven million people sit and wait for death? No, we must urgently mobilize, rise up together, save ourselves, and defend ourselves, preventing the water from flooding north. If that happens, the Yellow River will be raging, whether it flows south or north is unpredictable. Therefore, this issue is now not only a problem for the people of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan three provinces, but a common problem for our compatriots in the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Now, in order to avert this ancient catastrophe, at this critical moment, we appeal to you with the utmost sincerity. Our only common solution now is to unite and wage a life-and-death struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, forcing them to immediately stop the breach blocking project and abandon the crime of releasing water, so that we have the opportunity to dredge the river, repair the dikes, and relocate and resettle the residents in the riverbed. Otherwise, we will all perish under the Kuomintang reactionaries' malicious policies.

　　Compatriots, save us! Saving us is saving yourselves.

　　Seven million residents in eighteen counties along the old course of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, kowtowing.

　　制止国民党水淹五省
    冀鲁豫沿河七百万居民
    向豫皖苏同胞呼吁团结起来救人自救
    【新华社邯郸讯】冀鲁豫区沿黄河故道十八县的七百万人民，顷特向豫皖苏三省同胞发出呼吁，要求共起制止国民党反动派放水危害五省人民之阴谋，全文如下：
    黄河南岸豫皖苏各省同胞公鉴：
    黄河自民国二十七年被国民党决堤改道南迁以后，八年来你们已备尝黄河水灾的苦痛，我们非常同情，“天下百姓是一家”，所以我们并不反对黄河归复故道，但你们必能了解我们受黄水的灾害有数千百年之久，仅民国二年至二十六年黄河决口即达十二次之多，不知淹死了我们多少父老兄弟姊妹，不知冲毁了我们多少田地、房屋、财产。特别抗战以后，我们经了八年敌灾，二年天灾，创剧痛深，兼之故道堤坝大部毁坏，如不先加修复，而遽然驱水北来，我们就立有地尽泽国，人尽鱼鳖之惨祸。因此我们再三再四的要求国民党政府，首先复堤浚河，然后堵口放水，并在工程进行期间修理新道堤岸，防止泛区扩大，并积极救济新泛区广大灾胞。虽经多次谈判，多次订立协议，但均被国民党所推翻，近更置我三千万人民之意见及生命财产于不顾，丝毫不管复堤浚河等工程及迁移救济等问题，只加紧花园口堵口工程，限本月底合龙放水，以配合其军事行动，进攻我解放区，毁灭我人民。同胞们！我们七百万人岂能坐以待毙吗？不，我们只有紧急动员，一致奋起，自救自卫，阻水北泛。若然，则黄水滔天，或南或北，殊虽逆料。因此，现在这一问题已不仅是我们冀鲁豫三省人民的问题，而是我们冀鲁豫皖苏五省同胞的共同问题，我们现在为了挽回此亘古浩劫，当此时机紧迫之际，仅以十二万分的诚意向你们呼吁，我们现在惟一的共同良策，就是一致团结起来向国民党反动派作生死斗争，使其立即停止堵口工程，抛弃放水罪行，让我们有浚河复堤，迁移安置河床居民的机会，否则我们将在国民党反动派的恶毒政策下同归于尽。
    同胞们，救救我们，救了我们也就是救了你们自己。
                冀鲁豫区沿黄河故道十八县七百万居民同叩
