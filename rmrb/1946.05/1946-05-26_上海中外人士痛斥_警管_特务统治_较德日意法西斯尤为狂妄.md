　　Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Personages Denounce the "Police Control" Special Agent Rule
    More Arrogant Than German, Japanese, and Italian Fascism
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Shanghai News: Chinese and foreign personages here are rising up to oppose the "police officer precinct system." Political Consultative Conference (PCC) representative Huang Yanpei believes that this anti-democratic fascist system cannot be justified by any law book. Even German, Japanese, and Italian fascists never had such arrogant open secret agents. He said: "Who would have thought that today, when German, Japanese, and Italian fascism is defeated, the fascist germs are not dead, but have even further advanced to allow secret agents to operate openly." Professor Ma Xulun, in an article in the Wenhui Daily refuting the so-called "the principles and system of visits, stating its goals" remark by Zhang Jinzhi, director of the Inspection Department of the Police Bureau, stated: "The 'police precinct system' is clearly a scheme to control the activities of democratic elements. How can Zhang Jinzhi quibble!" Recently, the Kuomintang announced that it would first implement it in the Changshu district, which further exposes the Kuomintang's original intention to destroy democratic elements." Mr. Ma bluntly pointed out this conspiracy, saying: "I know that there are indeed many democratic elements living in the Changshu district, and the police station naturally has records to check. So, his intention to start the trial in Changshu district is so-called 'having its own goals.'" Zhou Jianren said: "I am worried for the authorities and hope they will not use unreasonable methods to force good compatriots to become angry." The Millard's Review also pointed out that the implementation of this system will cause all Chinese and foreign personages, regardless of race, skin color, belief, or political views, to lose their freedom.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Chongqing News: PCC representative of the Democratic League, Luo Longji, recently made a statement to reporters, denouncing the "police officer precinct system" about to be implemented in Shanghai, saying: He cannot see any difference between this police precinct system and the past dictatorships and rule of the German, Japanese, and Italian fascist countries over the people. Today in China, there is still such a thorough fascist thing coming out to rule the people. The police can arbitrarily run into the homes of ordinary people and use white, blue, and red documentary films to strengthen fascist rule. Standing on the position of the Chinese people and the position of the Democratic League, he expressed his firm opposition. Luo also said: This anti-democratic fascist police officer precinct system will only plunge Chinese politics and the Chinese people into deeper chaos and pain. Now we must use the power of the entire nation to not allow this fascist thing to be realized.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Chongqing News: The Sichuan Construction Promotion Association recently expressed its opinions to the authorities, opposing the establishment of the "police officer precinct system," opposing student military training, and opposing the continued collection of land tax in kind. The association pointed out that the "police precinct system" is a more intensified form of secret agent rule. It also stated: The people are not robbers, let alone slaves of a conquered nation. This means of destroying the freedom of national life in the name of "preventing petty thieves" is an insult to all the people, and they are determined to oppose it to the death. Regarding student military training, it is believed that at the time of peace and national construction, there should no longer be such wartime measures. Regarding the collection of land tax in kind, it is tantamount to the three million conscripted young men who have not yet been demobilized, the extreme shortage of rural labor, and the Sichuan people who have suffered from drought, being cut off from life. It is heard that the Kuomintang authorities recently intend to implement the "police officer precinct system" in the provinces and cities under its rule, with Shanghai as its starting point.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Moscow Radio today broadcast: The Shanghai Police Bureau searched the "Freedom Life" and other bookstores and confiscated publications such as the Democratic Weekly and Wenhui Magazine.

### 上海中外人士痛斥“警管”特务统治  较德日意法西斯尤为狂妄

　　上海中外人士痛斥“警管”特务统治
    较德日意法西斯尤为狂妄
    【新华社延安二十三日电】沪讯：此间中外人士纷起反对“警员警管区制”。政协代表黄炎培氏认为这种违反民主的法西斯制度，即使翻破了所有法律书，也找不出根据来。德日意法西斯也不曾有如此狂妄的公开特务。他说：“谁想到今天德日意法西斯打败的时候，竟然法西斯细菌未死，却又进一步的将特务予以公开活动”。马叙伦教授在文汇报所驳斥警局督察处处长张进之所谓“访问的原则与制度，自述其目标”一语称：“警管区制”显系管制民主分子的活动的勾当，张进之何容狡辩！最近国民党宣布先自常熟区施行，这更暴露了国民党想摧残民主分子的原形。”马氏直率指出这一阴谋说：“我晓得民主分子住在常熟区的确不少，警察局自然有案可稽，那么他要从常熟区试起，就是所谓“自有其目标。”周建人氏说：“我为当局担心，希望他们不要用不合情理的方法，硬迫得善良的同胞都愤怒起来”。密勒士评论报也指出这种制度的实行，将使所有中外人士，不分种族、肤色、信仰、政见，大家失去自由。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】渝讯：民盟政协代表罗隆基，顷对记者发表谈话，痛斥沪市即将实行的“警员警管区制”称：这种警管区制，他想不出与过去德日意法西斯国家对人民的专制与统治有什么区别，今天在中国竟还有这种彻头彻尾法西斯的东西出来统治人民，警察可以任意跑入老百姓的家里，用什么白色蓝色红色的记录片来加强法西斯统治。站在中国人民的立场，站在民主同盟的立场，他表示坚决反对。罗氏又说：这种反民主的法西斯警员警管区制，只有使中国的政治及中国人民陷入更深的纷乱与痛苦。现在我们要以全国人民的力量，不许有这种法西斯的东西实现。
    【新华社延安二十三电】渝讯：四川建设促进会顷代表对当局意见，反对建立“警员警管区制”，反对学生集训及田赋继续征实。该会指出：“警管区制”是一种变本加厉的特务统治。并称：人民不是强盗，更不是亡国奴，这种借“防止宵小”为名，破坏国民生活自由的手段，有辱全体国民，决誓死反对。关于学生集训，则认为现值和平建国时，亦不应再有此战时措施。关于田赋征实，则认为无异于三百万出征壮丁，尚未复员，农村劳动力极度缺少，又遭旱灾的四川老百姓，断绝生命。闻国民党当局近拟在其所统治的各省市内实行“警员警管区制”，上海为其开端云。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】莫斯科今日广播：上海警察总局，搜查自由派的生活等书店，没收了民主周报及文汇杂志等刊物。
