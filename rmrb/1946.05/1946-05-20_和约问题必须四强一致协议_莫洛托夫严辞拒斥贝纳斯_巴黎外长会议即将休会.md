　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th】 Paris dispatch: On the afternoon of the 15th, the four foreign ministers held their 24th meeting. During the discussion of Byrnes' four proposals on the 14th, it was unanimously agreed that the conference would adjourn as soon as the German question was discussed on the 16th, and reconvene in Paris on June 15th. Amendments to the Italian armistice terms were also passed after slight revisions. Regarding the date for the peace conference, Byrnes requested that it be left for the June 25th meeting. Molotov stated that the Soviet Union did not object to holding the peace conference at any time, but it required the unanimous agreement of the four powers on the peace treaty, as decided by the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. Byrnes' attempt to force the Soviet Union to accept the opinions of the United States and Britain by using the majority of small countries (estimated to be about fifteen or sixteen) he could control at the peace conference was sternly rejected by Molotov. The suggestion to place the Austrian question on the agenda for the next meeting was also rejected by the Soviet side. Molotov stated in this regard that the question was not included in the procedures stipulated by the Potsdam Conference, and that important issues such as the Italian peace treaty had not yet been resolved, so no further troubles could be created. Molotov also rejected Bevin's suggestion (which requested that the foreign ministers exchange opinions on the Austrian question through normal diplomatic channels). At the morning meeting on the 15th, while discussing the German question, Byrnes proposed appointing a special committee to study and investigate the entire German-related issues, while seeking an agreement on the German peace treaty, in order to submit a report to the reconvened Foreign Ministers' Conference, and proposed another peace conference to be held as soon as possible on November 12th. This proposal will be put to a vote at the meeting on the 16th.

　　和约问题必须四强一致协议
    莫洛托夫严辞拒斥贝纳斯
    巴黎外长会议即将休会
    【新华社延安十九日电】巴黎讯：十五日下午，四外长举行第二十四次会议，在讨论贝纳斯十四日四项建议时，一致通过一俟德国问题于十六日讨论完毕后，会议即实行休会，延至六月十五日再于巴黎复会。对意休战条款之修正案，经稍加修正后亦付通过。关于规定和会日期问题，贝纳斯要求留交六月二十五日会议上决定。莫洛托夫称：苏不反对任何时候召开和会，但需按照莫斯科外长会议的决定，先有四强对和约的一致协议。贝纳斯意欲以其在和会上可能控制之小国多数（预计约十五六国）。强制苏联接受美英意见之企图，遭到莫洛托夫的严辞拒斥。奥地利问题置于下次会议议程之建议，亦遭苏方拒绝，莫洛托夫对此声称：该问题并未包括在波茨顿会议所规定之程序上，而且对意和约等重要问题，俱未获得解决，不能再找麻烦。莫洛托夫并拒绝贝文之建议（该建议要求各外长经过正常外交途径，对奥地利问题交换意见）。十五日上午会议上，讨论德国问题时，贝纳斯提议任命一特别委员会，以研究并调查整个德国有关问题，同时谋求对德和约之协议，以便向复会之外长会议提出报告，并提出尽可能于十一月十二日召开之另一和会，该项建议将于十六日之会议上付诸讨论。
