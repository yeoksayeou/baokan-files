　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 28th】Rome Dispatch: The Italian elections will be held on June 2nd. This is the first general election for the Italian people since 1922. At that time, the Italian people (including women, who are also getting the right to vote for the first time) will vote to elect 540 members of the Constituent Assembly and will express their attitude towards the monarchy. Due to the widespread democratic movement in Italy after the fall of the fascist regime, especially the large scale of the people's democratic movement in northern Italy, unlike other countries in Europe (such as Greece), the Italian reactionaries did not demand immediate elections, but used all means to delay the elections. The remnants of fascism mainly appear as royalists. They are supported more or less by the "Liberal Party" (the traditional party of big landlords and industrialists) within the government and the advisory council, as well as the Christian Democratic Party, and the Labour Democratic Party, and are supported by fascist financiers who fled to Switzerland, and by fascist military officers and senior bureaucrats in the country who have not yet been purged, and by big landlords in southern Italy. The Polish exiled General Anders' troops (currently stationed on the Adriatic coast), who are nurtured by Britain, and even some measures taken by the British and American military government, have also become the backing for the royalists to carry out anti-people activities. After their attempt to delay the elections failed, they adopted the despicable means of assassinating candidates from various democratic parties. However, such reactionary activities cannot stop the Italian people's desire for democracy. At present, no place in Italy has returned to a normal peacetime state. The situation of food, fuel and transportation is very serious. The number of unemployed workers reached two million in February of this year, and is still increasing. The people are eager to end this situation. Relying on their own experience, the Italian people place their hopes on the Italian Communist Party. In January of this year, the Italian Communist Party had 1.8 million members (including about 300,000 women and about 400,000 young people under the age of 25). In a certain province, 15 percent of the residents participated in the Communist Party. With the trust of the people, the Italian Communist Party is not only confident in the election, but also deeply believes that under the conditions of the unanimous approval of the Republic by the people of the whole country, resolutely breaking with the reactionaries, eliminating fascism, and maintaining unity with all democratic forces, the Italian Communist Party can satisfy the people's desires, restore national independence, guarantee labor welfare, unite the people, and realize a thorough democratization program. In the local elections (held in March), the Socialist Party, which closely cooperated with the Italian Communist Party, has no major differences in its program with the Communist Party. Their joint actions will continue before and after the election. The Italian people are deeply convinced that the consistency and joint action of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party will bring a new scene to the upcoming general election.

　　意大选行将举行
    意共对选举深具信心能够满足人民的欲望
    【新华社延安二十八日电】罗马讯：意大利大选，将于六月二日举行，这是一九二二年以来意国人民的第一次大选，届时意大利人民（包括妇女，她们也第一次得到选举权），将投票选举立宪会议的五百四十名议员，并将表示他们对君主制度的态度。由于意大利在法西斯政权倒台后的普遍的民主运动高潮，尤其是意大利北部人民民主运动的巨大规模，与在欧洲其他国家（例如希腊）不同，意反动派不是要求立即选举，而是用一切方法迟延选举。法西斯残余主要以保皇党面孔出现，他们得到政府及咨询议会内部的“自由党”（传统的大地主与大工业家的政党）、及基督教民主党、与劳工民主党或多或少的支持，并得到逃往瑞士的法西斯财政家、及国内尚未被清洗的法西斯军官与大官僚、及意南部的大地主的支持，被英国豢养的波兰流亡将军安德斯的部队（现驻于亚得里亚海滨）以及甚至英美军政府的某些措施，也都成了保皇党进行反人民活动的靠山。他们进行迟延选举的企图失败后，就采取了暗杀各民主党候选人的卑劣手段，但是，这种反动活动，阻止不了意大利人民的民主欲求。目前意国内还没有一个地方的生活，已返回了正常的平时状态，粮食燃料与运输的情况，非常严重，失业工人在本年二月间，即达两百万，目前还在增加。人民急于要求结束这个状况，依靠自身的经验，意国人民把希望寄托在意大利共产党身上。今年一月间，意共即有一百八十万党员（其中妇女约三十万，二十五岁以下的青年约四十万），而在某个省内，居民的百分之十五都参加了共产党。在人民的信赖之下，意共不仅对选举抱有信心，而日深信在全国人民一致同意赞成共和国、坚决与反动派分裂、并萧清法西斯、及与一切民主力量保持团结等条件下，意共能够满足人民的欲望，恢复国家独立，保证劳工福利，团结人民，实现彻底民主化政纲。在地方选举（已于三月间举行）中，即与意共密切合作的社会党，在纲领上与共产党并无重要分歧，他们的联合行动，在选举之前与以后，均将继续下去。意国人民深信意共与社会党的一致与联合行动，将给行将到来的大选带来新的景象。
