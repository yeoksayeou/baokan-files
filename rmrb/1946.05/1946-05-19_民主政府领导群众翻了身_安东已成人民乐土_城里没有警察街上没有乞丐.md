　　Democratic Government Leads the Masses to Liberation
    Andong Has Become a Paradise for the People
    No Police in the City, No Beggars on the Streets
    【Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 16th】 Our correspondent Liu Baiyu recently introduced Andong City under the title "Visiting Andong City." The full text is as follows:
    I slept overnight on the Anfeng Railway train and arrived in Andong on the Yalu River in the morning.
    Andong is a beautiful, orderly, and prosperous city. It is the best city I have seen since traveling from Chongqing to Beijing and Shenyang. The markets display piles of goods, food, and fruits. Countless ships are docked on the riverbank. At dawn, the factory whistles from near and far sound, awakening people from their sweet sleep. Everyone is working hard, with smiles of liberation on their faces.
    On the 14th, I visited Mayor Lü Qien. He is a native of Andong, tall, and a tenacious, capable, and optimistic person. The improved material life and good social order that the people have achieved in just six months, as I have seen today, are inseparable from Mayor Lü's outstanding efforts.
    He said: Andong City has a population of more than 300,000. The social order of Andong City was established on the basis of destroying the enemy puppet regime. After Japan surrendered on August 15th, Andong fell into extreme chaos. On September 17th, after the People's Self-Defense Forces entered Andong, the puppet mayor Cao Chengzong and other puppet special agents colluded with each other and secretly prepared for a New Year's Day riot. Fortunately, it was discovered by our Public Security Bureau in advance and suppressed. The planner, instigator, commander, and leader of this conspiracy riot, the Japanese special agent Yoshioka, had been a special agent in Changchun and Harbin for more than 20 years. The Kuomintang appointed him as the chief of staff of the Kuomintang Advance Army. They organized various special agent secret armed forces and later prepared several times for riots, all of which were discovered in advance. They also set fires everywhere. The Andong Court was burned down by the Japanese special agent Fujikyu, who was bought by the KMT special agents. Now Yoshioka, Fujikyu, and the Japanese who secretly organized the riots have all been arrested.
    After walking on the streets twice at night, I know that Andong is now a city without police. But compared to the past, it is a completely different world. In the past, during the puppet Manchukuo era, there were no pedestrians during the day. During the "Maintenance Association after August 15th" era, there was robbery and chaos. Later, thanks to the people's automatic organization of self-defense forces to patrol various places, stability and peace were maintained here.

### 民主政府领导群众翻了身  安东已成人民乐土  城里没有警察街上没有乞丐

　　民主政府领导群众翻了身
    安东已成人民乐土
    城里没有警察街上没有乞丐
    【新华社安东十六日电】本社记者刘白羽顷以“访问安东市”为题介绍安东市，全文如下：
    我在安奉铁路的火车上睡了一夜，早晨就到了鸭绿江边的安东。
    安东是一个美丽整齐繁荣的都市，是我从重庆到北京、沈阳以来所见到的最好的都市，商场里陈设着成堆的物品、食粮和水果，江岸停着无数的船舶，黎明的时候，远近工厂的气笛都响起来，唤醒了人们甜美的睡眠，所有的人都紧张的劳动着，面上浮着翻身后的笑容。
    十四日，我访问了吕其恩市长，他是安东人，高大身材，是一个坚韧能干而乐观的人，今天我所见的在短短六个月中人民物质生活得到改善和良好的社会秩序，这与吕市长的卓异努力是分不开的。
    他说：安东市有三十多万人口，安东市人民社会的秩序，是在摧毁敌伪政权基础上建立的。“八一五”日本投降以后，安东陷于极度混乱，九月十七日，人民自卫军进入安东后，伪市长曹承宗等伪特日特，勾结一起，秘密活动，准备阳历年暴动，幸事前被我公安局发觉，镇压下去了。这个阴谋暴动的计划者发动者指挥领导者日本特务吉冈，在长春哈尔滨干了二十多年的特务，国民党加委他为国民党挺进军参谋长，他们组织了各种名目的特务秘密武装，以后又几次准备暴动，都被预先发觉。他们还到处放火，安东法院就是国特收买日特藤九放火烧毁的，现在吉冈田藤九及秘密组织暴动的日本人，都被捕了。
    我夜间在街路走过两次之后，知道现在安东是一个没有警察的城市，可是今天和过去比较，却是截然不同的两个世界了。从前伪满时代，白天不见行人，“八一五后维持会”时代，是抢劫与混乱，后来由于人民自动组织了自卫队，巡逻各地，才维持了这里的平稳与安乐。
