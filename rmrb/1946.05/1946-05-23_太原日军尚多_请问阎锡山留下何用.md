　　There are Still Many Japanese Troops in Taiyuan
    What Use is it to Keep Yan Xishan?
    [Handan, 19th Dispatch] Further investigation on the 17th revealed that there are still more than 1,200 members of a special service brigade stationed in Shouyang, Shanxi, led by Battalion Commander Taketō Tomio. The Japanese engineering brigade in Yuci and the Japanese officers training school in Taiyuan have already recruited more than 200 Japanese officers and are still continuing to recruit. This proves that there are still many Japanese troops in Taiyuan. Six hundred odd people are stationed in Dingxiang, and a part in Wutai, the number of which is unknown.
    [Handan, 19th Dispatch] Our CCP representatives in the East Qin Executive Group have been subjected to torture by Yan's puppet troops. Our representatives are frequently given raw rice, lukewarm water, false reports, and restricted activities. Such conspiracies are countless, attempting to force our representatives to withdraw in order to facilitate their deployment for civil war. In order to persist in mediation work, our representatives have endured everything, trying to obtain cooked rice from our defense zone to continue the work of the East Qin Group. After Yan's puppet troops discovered this, they fired three shots at our rice delivery personnel on the 14th. Our representatives have protested to the KMT representatives about Yan's puppet troops shooting at our staff.

　　太原日军尚多
    请问阎锡山留下何用
    【邯郸十九日电】十七日继续查明日军留驻山西的又有驻寿阳之特务大队一千二百余人，大队长为岳藤田雄信。榆次日军工程大队，太原日军士官训练学校已招日本士以上军官二百余人，现仍继续招生，足证太原日军尚多。留驻定襄者六百余人，五台一部，人数不详。
    【邯郸十九日电】东沁执行组我中共代表备受阎伪军折磨，经常给我方代表吃生饭、喝半开水、虚报情况、限制活动，类此阴谋不胜枚举，企图以此逼迫我代表撤退，以便其布置内战。我方代表为了坚持调处工作，一律忍受，设法从我防区取些熟饭，继续坚持东沁小组工作。被阎伪发觉后，于十四日向我送饭人员连发三枪。我代表对阎伪射击我工作人员，已向国方代表提出抗议。
