　　Zhang Xueyan on the rhetoric of the two parties
    Facts are better than abuse
    The CCP persuades with reason, while the Kuomintang's reasoning is poor and their words clumsy.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] Chongqing News: Mr. Zhang Xueyan, editor of the Christian journal "Tianjia Half-Monthly," published an article entitled "On the Mutual Scolding of the Two Parties," subtitled "The Chairman is a Public Servant, Not an Emperor," in the "United Three-Day Publication" published in Chongqing on April 16. He commented on the "Liberation Daily" editorial "Refuting Chiang Kai-shek" and the unreasonable abuse of the Kuomintang newspapers, saying: "Our overall impression of the mutual scolding of the two sides is that the Communist Party's organ newspaper—Yan'an's "Liberation Daily"—refutes Chairman Chiang's method by trying its best to list factual evidence and using Chairman Chiang's own remarks as basic examples, with the purpose of persuading people with 'reason.' The Kuomintang's organ newspaper uses the opposite method of refutation. It does not refute the facts listed by the "Liberation Daily," but only uses angry emotions to scold the Communist Party. Following this, Mr. Zhang first listed Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day address in the 34th year of the Republic of China, saying that he wanted to "vigorously adopt public opinion and broad criticism." Therefore, Mr. Zhang said that Chiang Kai-shek is a "public servant" rather than an "emperor," in order to refute the Kuomintang organ newspaper's so-called "insulting the head of state." Secondly, he believes that the Kuomintang organ newspaper's scolding of our party as "thugs" "inevitably gives people the feeling that their reasoning is poor and their words clumsy." After listing facts such as the Kunming bloodbath and the Jiaochangkou incident, Mr. Zhang said: "Mentioning thugs and damage makes people shudder." Finally, Mr. Zhang said: "Facts speak louder than eloquence, right and wrong are in people's hearts, and the people will see the suffering in their hearts."

　　张雪岩论两党言论
    事实胜于漫骂
    中共以理服人国民党理穷词拙
    【新华社延安二十二日电】渝讯：基督教会刊物《田家半月刊》主编张雪岩氏，四月十六日在重庆出版之《联合三日刊》上发表《论两党对骂》，副题为《主席是公仆，不是皇帝》一文，对解放日报社论《驳蒋介石》，及国民党报纸无理漫骂评称：“我们对两方的互骂，获得一个总的印象，就是共产党机关报——延安的解放日报，驳斥蒋主席的方法，是竭力列举实证，并以蒋主席自家的言论作基本证例，目的是在以“理”服人，国民党的机关报所用的反驳方法，就恰恰相反，对解放日报所列举的事实没有驳辩，只是用愤怒的情感责骂共产党。接着张氏首先列举蒋介石三十四年元旦训词，说要“力采舆论广泛批评”，所以张氏说蒋介石是“公仆”而不是“皇帝”，用以驳斥国民党机关报所谓“侮辱元首”之言。其次，他认为国民党机关报骂我党为“暴徒”，“未免使人发生理穷词拙之感”。张氏并列举昆明血案及较场口等事实后称：“提到暴徒，损害，使人不寒而栗”。最后张氏说：“事实胜雄辩，是非在人心，内心的苦，人民会看到的”。
