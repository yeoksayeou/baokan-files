　　Jincheng Reviews Mass Movement Leadership Experience
    Letting Go Is Not Equal to Abandonment; Leadership Is Like "Driving a Cart"
    Jin-Sui Faction Work Team Assists Mass Movement in New Districts
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng, 15th] Jincheng's Sixth District recently held a district and village cadre meeting to review the mass movement. It was discovered that cadres had a tendency to abandon leadership, mainly because some village cadres mistakenly believed that bold delegation meant no leadership, resulting in laissez-faire. For example, there was a theory that the county cannot manage the district, the district cannot manage the village, and the village cannot manage the people. The chairman of the Yuanzhuang Farmers' Association, when the masses were struggling, did not care about it, and said that this was letting go to mobilize the masses. After this meeting, the problem was clarified. Letting go to mobilize the masses does not mean that leadership is not needed, but that leadership must be strengthened, closely united with the masses, and the leadership role must be boldly brought into play. As the cadres of Zhoucun said: "Leaders are like carters. Walking behind the car and not understanding the situation in front will lead to the ditch; walking in front, fearing that you will not get on the right path, the carter must walk with the car, closely adjacent to the car, and see the front, back, left, and right to go straight." Finally, it was unanimously agreed that the targets of struggle should be divided into large and small, important and unimportant, discussed and decided by the masses, and cadres should not be separated from the masses.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 14th] The Third Sub-district sent a work team of more than 200 people to the newly liberated areas of Lishi and other places to assist in carrying out rent reduction work. Every time they arrive in a village, they participate in mass production, and discover problems from being with the masses, publicize policies and laws to activists, and unite the masses through them, minimizing meetings to avoid delaying mass production. After 20 days of hard work, the mass movement has been further developed. According to statistics from Tianjiahui and other villages, 61 landlords have legally returned rent, and 56 tenants have benefited from the rent return. In the anti-corruption struggle, 34 shi of embezzled grain and 360,000 yuan of embezzled money were cleared. After the work team was stationed in the villages, the work in many surrounding villages also started. This kind of work team, assisting local cadres to break through the center and carry out work, is an effective method in the newly liberated areas. In order to avoid the problem of "the work collapses when people leave," they also help to transform the village government and farmers' association organizations, cleanse bad elements, promote active and outstanding elements, establish a leadership core, and lay the foundation for future work.

　　晋城检讨群运领导经验
    放手不等于自流领导如同“赶车”
    晋绥派工作团协助新区群运
    【新华社阳城十五日电】晋城六区，于日前召开区村干部会议，检讨群众运动，发现干部中有放弃领导的偏向，主要的是有些村干部误认大胆放手为不要领导，形成放任自流。如有这样一种理论，说县不能管区，区不能管村，村不能管老百姓。元庄农会主席，当群众斗争时，自己不管，并说这是放手发动群众。经过这次会议，把这问题弄明白了，放手发动群众不是不要领导，而是更要加强领导，紧紧和群众在一块，大胆发挥领导作用，正如周村的干部所说：“领导人员和赶车人一样，走在车后不了解前边情况，会赶到沟里；走在前面，怕走不上正路，赶车人要与车走在一起，紧紧挨着车，前后左右要看到才能走直路”。最后又一致认为，斗争对象要分出大小轻重，由群众讨论群众决定，干部不能脱离群众干。
    【新华社兴县十四日电】三分区派出二百余人组成之工作团，赴离石等地新解放区协助开展减租工作。他们每到一村，就参加群众生产，和群众在一起从中发现问题，向积极分子宣传政策法令，通过他们去团结群众，尽量少开会，以免耽误群众生产，这样经过二十天的努力，群众运动已进一步开展。据田家会等村的统计，已有六十一个地主依法退租，五十六个佃户获得退租利益。在反贪污斗争中清算出贪污粮三十四石，贪污款三十六万余元。工作团驻过的村庄，工作开展后，周围许多村庄的工作也随之开展起来。此种工作团，协助地方干部突破中心，开展工作，在新解放区是有效的办法。为了避免发生“人走工作垮”的毛病，还帮助改造村政权与农会组织，清洗不良分子，提拔积极优秀分子，建立领导核心，打下今后工作的基础。
