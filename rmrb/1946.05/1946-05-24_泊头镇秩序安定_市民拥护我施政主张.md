　　Order is Stable in Botou Town
    Citizens Support My Governance Proposals
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 20th] Kang Rumin, acting mayor of Botou Town, Tian Weixin, garrison commander, and other subordinate cadres are actively establishing social order and stabilizing people's lives. The city has been divided into five districts. At 11:00 AM on the 13th, the masses in Botou held a grand meeting to welcome the Jiaohe Security Team and personnel of the democratic government. Zhang Zishan, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, reported on the policy proposals of the Communist Party at the meeting, which immediately received enthusiastic applause from the participants, expressing their support. In the past week, various tasks have been carried out. Currently, except for the electric light factory and telegraph bureau destroyed by the puppet bandits, all factories and hotels in the city have resumed work and business, with public buying and selling in an orderly manner. Various elementary schools are preparing to formally start classes. Slogans such as "Welcome the Eighth Route Army to the city to maintain public order" and "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are the saviors of the people of Botou" are visible everywhere. At the same time, the masses who have suffered from the ravages and looting of the enemy and puppets for the past eight years are flocking to the municipal government to accuse Xu Chunlin of his crimes and demand immediate relief. The democratic government has allocated 100,000 jin of grain to provide emergency relief to the affected merchants and residents.

　　泊头镇秩序安定
    市民拥护我施政主张
    【新华社河间二十日电】泊头镇代理市长康茹民、卫戍司令田维新等，正领导所属干部，积极建立社会秩序，安定人民生活。该市已划分为五个市区，十三日上午十一时，泊市群众举行大会，欢迎交河保安队，及民主政府人员。中共代表张子善在会上报告共产党施政主张，当即受到与会人民狂热鼓掌，表示拥护。在过去一周中，各项工作均有开展，现全市除被伪匪摧毁之电灯厂、电报局外，各工厂酒店均已复工复业，公买公卖，井然有序。各个小学正筹备正式开课，“欢迎八路军进城，维持治安”；“共产党、八路军是泊市人民的救星”等各式各样的标语，到处可见。同时八年来惨遭敌伪蹂躏抢劫的群众，成群结队到市政府控诉徐春林罪行并要求速予救济，民主政府已拨粮十万斤，首先对受灾商民进行急赈。
