　　France's Parliamentary Elections Approaching
    French Communist Party Calls to Defend Democracy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Fourteenth] Paris Dispatch: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a communique, calling for the mobilization of all democratic forces nationwide to defeat all the reactionary派's conspiracies and plans in the June 2nd parliamentary elections, in order to defend France's democratic cause. French Communist leader Maurice Thorez, in a speech in Paris, called on the people to vote for the Communist candidates who are fighting for France's democratic unity.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Fourteenth] Paris Dispatch: The right-wing elements in France are increasingly actively engaged in a plot to split the Socialist Party. Recently, the reactionaries have continuously slandered, claiming that the Socialist Party has been exploited by the Communist Party and that the Socialist Party's program is too left-wing and needs to be revised. The right wing of the French Socialist Party, led by Léon Blum, has echoed this propaganda and issued a declaration stating that the Socialist Party will participate in the upcoming parliamentary elections with independent action and independently engage in future domestic political life. The publication of this declaration immediately aroused fierce opposition from left-wing elements within the Socialist Party.

    【新华社延安十四日电】巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会发表公报、号召动员全国一切民主力量，在六月二日国会选举中，击破反动派一切阴谋计划，以保卫法国民主事业。法共领袖多列士在巴黎发表演说时，号召人民投票拥护为法国民主团结统一而奋斗的共产党侯选人。
    【新华社延安十四日电】巴黎讯：法右翼分子分裂社共合作的阴谋、益趋积极，近来反动派不断诽谤称：社会党受了共产党利用，社会党的政纲太左了，须要修正，以勃鲁姆为首的法社会党右翼，已附和此种宣传，并发表宣言，声称：社会党将以独立行动，参加行将到来之国会竞选，并独立从事今后之国内政治生活。此宣言发表以后，当即引起社会党左翼分子之激烈反对。
