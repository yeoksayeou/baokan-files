　　【Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 28th】 The headquarters of the New Fourth Army, the Shandong Military Region, and the Jiaodong, Bohai, and Luzhong Military Regions have released large numbers of Kuomintang military officers and soldiers captured in the self-defense war. According to incomplete statistics, 798 people have been released, including one general, 126 colonels, and 325 lieutenants.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 27th】 On the 22nd and 23rd, the Luliang Military Region released the second group of 37 Yan officers captured in the self-defense war, returning them to their original units. Most of them were lieutenant-level officers from the 42nd and 49th Divisions.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 28th】 Yan Xishan continues to conscript wildly. The masses are fleeing from him. Up to now, in the Wenshui, Fenyang, and Fangshan areas alone, more than 3,000 refugees who have fled from the Yan area have been received. The democratic government is properly comforting them. In the Pingchuan area of central Shanxi, the following folk rhyme is popular: "Water flows to the lowest place, people go where they are treated well. If we want to live, we can only follow the Eighth Route Army." More and more people in the Yan area, supporting the old and carrying the young, are fleeing to the liberated areas.

　　各地我军释放俘虏阎军继续疯狂抓丁
    【新华社临沂二十八日电】新四军军部山东军区司全部，及胶东、渤海、鲁中各军区，大批释放在自卫战中所俘之国民党军官兵，据不完全统计，已释放七百九十八名，内将官一名，校官一百二十六名，尉官三百二十五名。
    【新华社兴县二十七日电】吕梁军区于二十二、二十三两日，第二批释放在自卫战争中俘虏之阎方官佐三十七名返回原部，其中大多数系四十二、四十九师之尉级军官。
    【新华社兴县二十八日电】阎锡山继续疯狂抓丁，群众相率逃避，截至目前止，仅文水、汾阳、方山一带，收容由阎区逃来之难民即逾三千余人。民主政府正妥为安抚。晋中平川各地，流行着下列民谣：“水往低处流，人往恩处走，咱们要想活，只有跟八路。”阎区群众扶老携幼投奔解放区者日众。
