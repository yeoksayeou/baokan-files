　　【New China News Agency, Changchun, 21st Dispatch】After the Kuomintang reactionaries occupied Fushun, remnant enemy and puppet forces once again raised their heads, and the city's residents were plunged back into a dark abyss. Guo Sheng, a puppet police officer during the puppet Manchukuo regime, bought the position of Director of the Fushun Public Security Bureau for 1.7 million yuan. Hua Yuting, a major drug dealer during the puppet Manchukuo regime and the "Opium Combination Chief," bought the rank of Kuomintang army colonel for one million yuan. Xu Changchun, the puppet police chief who had been wanted by the democratic government, also returned to Fushun with a mission. Leading the army, they arrested people everywhere. Within a month, the "National Army" had illegally arrested over 400 workers, staff, and students in Fushun. On March 15th, a righteous woman who had worked for the democratic government was arrested, paraded through the streets bound, and forced to say bad things about the Democratic Allied Army and the Communist Party, but she sternly refused. She said: "Even if you shoot me, I will never say a bad word about the Eighth Route Army or the Communist Party. I firmly oppose your autocracy and dictatorship!" Household registration was checked everywhere in the city, pedestrians were inspected, and people were asked to produce the "good citizen certificates" from the puppet Manchukuo regime. Laborers were forcibly conscripted day and night to build bunkers and gun emplacements, with each "group" forced to provide five laborers daily for more than eleven hours of labor. The officers are busy making money, they shipped large quantities of heroin and opium from Qinhuangdao and ordered local residents to buy them. Due to the excessive issuance of banknotes, prices have soared, generally several times higher than in the Democratic Allied Army-controlled areas outside the city. Grain is particularly expensive. For example, in early April, sorghum in the city cost 12.5 yuan per catty in puppet Manchukuo currency, while in the Democratic Allied Army defense area outside the city, it cost only two yuan per catty. The people of Fushun, unable to bear the oppression, have been fleeing to the Democratic Allied Army garrison.

　　国民党进占后
    抚顺重陷黑暗深渊
    民不堪命纷纷逃向解放区
    【新华社长春二十一日电】国民党反动派进占抚顺后，敌伪残余势力，重又抬头，市民再被投入了黑暗深渊。伪满时，抚顺市伪警察官郭生，以一百七十万元买得抚顺市公安局长，伪满时，大毒品贩“鸦片烟组合长”华雨亭，以百万元买得国军上校官职，曾为民主政府通缉的伪警察署长徐长春，亦负有任务，回至抚顺。他们领着军队，到处捕人，一个月内“国军”在抚顺已非法逮捕工人职员学生达四百余人。三月十五日，抓去曾在民主政府工作的一个具有正义感的妇女，被捆绑游街，并强迫她讲民主联军与共产党的坏话，但遭严词拒绝。她说：“你们枪毙了我，我也决不说八路军、共产党一句坏话。我坚决反对你们的专制独裁！”市内到处清查户口，检查行人，并向人民索取伪满的良民证，日夜抽抓劳工，修筑碉堡炮台，强迫每“组”每天去五个劳工，从事十一小时以上的劳役。军官们忙着发财，他们从秦皇岛运来大批海洛因和鸦片，勒令当地居民购买。由于滥发钞票，促使物价狂涨，一般比市外民主联军所在地高过数倍，尤以粮食最为昂贵，如四月上旬，市内高粱每斤伪满币十二元五角，而市外民主联军防区，每斤只二元，抚顺人民不堪压榨，已纷纷向民主联军驻地逃奔。
