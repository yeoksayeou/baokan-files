　　With the greatest grief, we commemorate Comrades Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Deng Fa, Ye Ting, Mr. Huang Qisheng, and other comrades who died at the same time. Because the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek and his fascist group sabotaged the Three Major Agreements, and in order to seek the realization of peace and democracy, and for the benefit of the country and the people, they risked the greatest danger, flying back and forth, and as a result, they were killed. This is an irreparable loss to our party and the Chinese people! Their sacrifice is a very painful thing for us, and at the same time, it reminds us once again: Chinese fascists and their chieftains will always hate the Chinese people, and will always hate peace and democracy. Only when the Chinese people see through their thoroughly reactionary nature and fully demonstrate their great and invincible strength can China's peace and democracy be truly realized. Chairman Mao called on us: turn grief into strength. We must use the strength of the liberated areas and the strength of the people of the whole country to inherit the legacy of the martyrs, stop the reaction of the fascists, adhere to the Three Major Agreements, and realize peace and democracy.

    Where does our strength lie? It lies in whether we can fully mobilize the masses of the people, turn themselves over and become the true masters of the country with their own strength; it lies in our consistent, unwavering unity.

    Since the counter-offensive last year, all parts of the border region have firmly grasped the central link of speaking out about suffering, seeking revenge, reducing rent and interest, and mobilizing the masses. This is very correct. However, we should all calmly reflect: Is the work of mobilizing the masses done enough? Are there people who only see some improprieties in certain struggle methods (which should of course be corrected) and shout "leftist," actually putting themselves in a position of being restrained, afraid to let go boldly, and even opposing the mass movement? Do they understand that today the problem is not enough mobilization, but not "excessive"? Do our comrades who do mass work still have the problem of not investigating, not studying, being crude and careless, and mobilizing the masses solely based on a few principles and subjective demands? Do they still have the problem of "patronizing views" and doing everything for the masses? Do they see that due to mistakes of doing everything for the masses and subjectivism, the masses in many places have not been truly mobilized, and there are still many blank spots? Are there still problems of violating policies such as infringing on the interests of middle peasants? Have those of us doing urban work made the mistake of moving the set of rural practices into the cities? Do our comrades who do workers' movements understand the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production? Are there problems of excessive demands that hinder economic prosperity? Do our comrades in the army support the people's emancipation movement with the greatest enthusiasm? Have they shown the essence of the people's army and actively participated in the people's emancipation movement? Are there still people who doubt or oppose the mass movement because their families have been struggled against by the masses? Are there still people who are emotionally opposed to the mass movement because of insufficient preferential treatment for families of soldiers or other shortcomings in individual places? If there are these shortcomings, they must be corrected, because if the masses of the people are not emancipated, there is no way to exert strength. If the masses of the people do not fully exert their strength, the cause of peace and democracy cannot be realized and cannot be consolidated. And our leadership and support for the people's emancipation must not be an empty concept, but must be expressed in concrete and practical actions.

    Here, we want to talk about the issue of work style. Chairman Mao taught us that our work style is a work style of unity between theory and practice, a work style of unity between the people and the people's interests, and a work style of self-criticism. With such a work style, we can truly serve the people and be the servants of the people. We must be vigilant. Since the counter-offensive, we have entered small and medium-sized cities. Have we maintained the work style of hard struggle and closeness to the masses? Every comrade should think, do I have the idea of hedonism? Do I have the problem of waste? This should arouse our serious attention. If this phenomenon develops, we will inevitably become detached from the masses, corrupt ourselves, and harm the Party and the country. We are not opposed to the enjoyment that each person should get within the scope of the system. We are not advocating enduring hardship to the end, but our lives must not be too far apart from the lives of the masses. Every penny we spend is the blood and sweat of the people. Today, when fascism is still rampant in China, a major enemy is present, the wounds of the eight-year war of resistance have yet to be healed, and the people's lives are still very difficult, if we do not take into account the people's ability to bear, if we waste, we will inevitably become detached from the masses and lead to failure. In the past, before Li Zicheng arrived in Beijing, he was indeed brave in combat, his policies were not bad, and his discipline was good, so he could get the support of the masses and win victory. Unexpectedly, once he arrived in Beiping, he became paralyzed against the enemy, did not talk about policies, became detached from the masses, his discipline was corrupted, and the soldiers lost their fighting spirit. In just a few dozen days, he brought about the failure of success. In the later period of the Great Revolution, there was also the so-called "Five Leathers Doctrine" (referring to taking pride in having leather bags, leather shoes, armed leather belts, leather whips, and leather leggings), which corrupted many revolutionary fighters. These historical lessons should be taken as a warning. Of course, today is different from the Great Revolution, and even more different from the Li Zicheng era, because there is the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, but it cannot be said that Chairman Mao's leadership is correct, and that every region and every comrade of ours is naturally correct. If we want to avoid making mistakes or make fewer mistakes, we must implement Chairman Mao's call, be vigilant, introspect, wash our faces often, check our work, and improve our work. If we can do this, we can stand with the people, the people's strength will be fully exerted, and we will be an invincible force.

    Speaking of unity, we are united, but are there any shortcomings? There are shortcomings. Taking the relationship between the army and the local area as an example, if a phenomenon of disharmony occurs, the army should first check its own responsibility. Of course, the local area should also check itself, focusing on self-criticism and correcting itself. From the overall relationship, the responsibility of the local area and the responsibility of the army cannot be put on an equal footing, because historical experience has proven that as long as the army is good to the local area, the local area will not be bad to the army. The army is one point good to the local area, and the local area is always two points good to the army. There is also a saying that is wrong, that is, the confused concept of so-called "the people are lovable, but the government cannot be supported." In fact, the government is the people's government. Those who do not support the government will not love the people. Supporting the government and loving the people cannot be separated.

    Finally, while mourning Comrade Wang Ruofei and others, I have two thoughts. One thought is that these comrades have all gone through decades of training, fighting for the cause of the Party and the people with unwavering loyalty. Comrades Wang and Ye have also sat in prison for several years in the struggle for the cause of the Party and the people. They did not care about personal honor or status, did not care about personal enjoyment, and wholeheartedly worked for the people. We are very saddened by their deaths, and we must learn from their valuable qualities of sacrificing everything and dedicating themselves to the revolution for life. Another thought is that from the history of our Party, it is proven that when we violate Chairman Mao's thoughts and policies, we will inevitably make mistakes, and even if we work hard, we will not be able to achieve results, and even harm the revolution. When we understand Chairman Mao's thoughts to some extent and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, we can play a greater role and do more things for the people. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, these comrades fought unyielding struggles against the reactionaries for the benefit of the people. They were good students of Chairman Mao and excellent leaders of the masses. How can their deaths not make us sad?!

    Comrades! Unite around Chairman Mao, learn Chairman Mao's thoughts, and train more good students of Chairman Mao to take over the posts of the deceased! Use greater efforts to mobilize the masses and unite them more closely. Use our strength and our unity to stop the conspiracies of the reactionaries, adhere to the Three Major Agreements, and realize peace and democracy! Only in this way can we make up for the loss of April 8th and console the spirits of the dead!

　　把悲痛变为力量，与人民密切结合！
    邓小平同志四月二十一日在党内干部追悼王若飞同志等殉难的会上的报告
    我们以最大的悲痛，来追悼王若飞、秦邦宪、邓发、叶挺诸同志和黄齐生老先生，以及其他同时被难的同志，他们因为国民党蒋介石及其法西斯集团破坏三大协议，为了求得和平民主的实现，为了国家和人民的利益，不惜冒着最大的危险，从空中飞来飞去，结果他们被难了，这是我党和中国人民不可补偿的损失！他们的牺牲，是我们很痛心的事，同时也再一次的提醒我们：中国法西斯及其头子永远是仇视中国人民的，永远是仇视和平仇视民主的，中国人民只有把他们的彻底反动性看得透透彻彻，充分表现自己的伟大的不可战胜的力量的时候，中国的和平与民主才能得到真正的实现。毛主席号召我们：把悲痛变为力量，我们要用解放区的力量，用全国人民的力量，来继承先烈的遗愿，制止法西斯的反动，坚持三大协议，实现和平民主。
    我们的力量在那里呢？在于我们能否把人民大众充分的发动起来，用自己的力量翻身起来，变成国家真正的主人翁；在于我们始终如一坚固不拔的团结。
    去年反攻以来，全边区各地抓紧了诉苦复仇减租减息发动群众的中心环节，这是很对的，但是我们大家应该冷静的反省一下：发动群众工作做得够不够？是否有人只看到某些斗争方式上的不妥当（当然是应该纠正的）而高喊“左了”，实际把自己放在束手束脚，不敢大胆放手，甚至反对群众运动的地位上？是否懂得今天是发动不够而非“过火”？我们作群众工作的同志，是否还有不调查、不研究、粗枝大叶、单凭几条原则和主观要求去发动群众的毛病？是否还有“恩赐观点”包办代替的毛病？是否看到由于包办代替和主观主义的错误而使许多地方的群众没有真正发动起来，空白地方还很多的现象？是否还有侵犯中农利益等等违反政策的毛病？我们作城市工作的，是否犯了把农村的一套搬到城市的毛病？我们作工人运动的同志，是否懂得劳资两利发展生产的方针？是否有要求过高妨害了繁荣经济的毛病？我们军队的同志，是否以最大的热情去拥护人民的翻身运动？是否表现了人民军队的本质去积极的参加人民的翻身运动？是否还有人因为自己家庭被群众斗争而怀疑或反对群众运动？是否还有人因个别地方优抗不够或其他缺点而在感情上与群众运动对立起来？如果有这些缺点就要好好改正，因为人民大众得不到翻身就无从发挥力量，人民大众不充分发挥出自己的力量，和平民主的事业就无法实现，无法巩固。而我们领导和拥护人民的翻身，绝不能是空洞的概念，而要以具体的实际行动来表现。
    这里，我们要谈一谈作风问题。毛主席教导我们，我们的作风是理论与实践一致的作风，是结合人民与人民利益相一致的作风，是自我批评的作风。有了这样的作风，我们才能真正做到为人民服务，当人民的勤务员。我们一定要警惕，在反攻以来，我们进入了中小城市，我们是否保持了艰苦奋斗与接近群众的作风？每个同志都想想，我有无享乐主义的思想？有无浪费的毛病？这点要引起我们严重的注意，如果这种现象发展起来，就一定要脱离群众、腐化自己、遗害党国。我们不反对在制度范围内各人应得的享受，我们不是提倡吃苦到底，但是必须使我们的生活与人民大众的生活不能相差太远，我们每一文钱的开支，都是人民付出的血汗。今天中国还是法西斯横行、大敌当前、八年抗战的创伤尚待医治，人民生活还是很苦的时候，如果不照顾人民的担负能力，如果浪费起来，我们必然脱离群众，招致失败。从前，李自成未到北京前，的确是作战勇敢，政策不坏，纪律良好，所以能够得到群众的拥护，获得胜利，不料一到北平，就对敌麻痹了，不讲政策了，脱离群众了，纪律败坏了，士无斗志了，短短的几十天，弄得功败垂成。大革命的后期，也有所谓“五皮主义”（指以有皮包、皮鞋、武装皮带、皮鞭、皮绑腿为荣），腐化了好多的革命战士，这些历史的教训，应引以为殷鉴。固然今天不同于大革命，更不同于李自成时代，因为有了以毛主席为首的共产党中央的领导，但不能说毛主席领导正确，我们各个区域，各个同志就当然正确，如果我们要想不犯错误或者少犯错误的话，就要实行毛主席的号召，警惕自己，反省自己，时常洗脸，检查工作，改进工作，能够这样，我们才能与人民站在一起，人民力量充分发挥起来了，我们才是不可战胜的力量。
    讲到团结，我们是团结的，但是有无缺点呢？是有缺点的。拿军队与地方的关系来说，如果发生了不协调的现象，应该首先检查军队的责任，当然地方也应检查自己，互相着重自我批评，加以纠正。从整个关系说来，不能把地方的责任和军队的责任平列起来，因为历来的经验证明：只要军队对地方好，地方没有不对军队好的，军队对地方好一分，地方总是对军队好两分。还有一种说法是不对的，就是所谓民可爱政不可拥的糊涂观念，事实上政就是人民的政，不拥政的人也就不会爱民，拥政爱民是不能分开的。
    最后，在悼念王若飞同志等的时候，我有两点感想，一点感想是这些同志个个都是经过几十年的锻炼，坚贞如一的为党和人民的事业奋斗，王叶两同志并在为党为人民事业斗争中，还坐了好几年的监牢，他们不计较个人的荣誉地位，不计较个人的享受，一心一意的为人民作事，对于他们的死，我们是万分沉痛的，我们更要学习他们不顾一切牺牲，终身献身革命的宝贵品质。一点感想是从我们党的历史证明：当我们违反了毛主席的思想和方针的时候，我们就必然要犯错误，就是很努力工作也做不出成绩来，甚至给革命以损害；当我们多少理解了毛主席的思想和切实执行毛主席的指示的时候，我们就可以发挥更多的作用，为人民做更多的事情，这些同志在毛主席的领导下，为了人民的利益，与反动派作不屈不挠的斗争，他们是毛主席的好学生，是群众的优秀领导者，他们的死怎能不令我们悲伤呢？！
    同志们！团结在毛主席的周围，学习毛主席思想，锻炼出更多的毛主席的好学生来接替死者的岗位！用更大的努力，把群众发动起来，更亲密的团结起来，用我们的力量，用我们的团结，去制止反动派的阴谋，坚持三大协议，实现和平民主！只有这样，才能补救四月八日的损失，以慰死者的英灵！
