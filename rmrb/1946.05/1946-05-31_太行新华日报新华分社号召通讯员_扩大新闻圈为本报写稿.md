　　Taihang Xinhua Daily, Xinhua Branch Calls on Correspondents
　　Expand News Circle to Write for This Newspaper
　　[Report from our Changzhi office on the 27th] After the publication of the People's Daily, the Taihang Xinhua Daily and the Taihang Xinhua Branch have specially called on all correspondents to expand the news circle, improve quality, and complete new tasks. Briefly stated: In order to expand the news circle and fully supply manuscripts to the People's Daily, we hereby call on: (1) Every correspondent comrade, especially key correspondent comrades, must clearly understand that their reporting is not only for the Taihang Xinhua Daily, but also for providing manuscripts to the People's Daily and manuscripts for nationwide broadcasts by the Yan'an General Agency. (2) Departments with weak communication work, such as factories, mines, banks, commercial firms, military camps, cultural education, medical and health, transportation, justice, as well as weak areas, are required to quickly strengthen communication reporting work, advance vigorously, and catch up. It is especially hoped that leading comrades at all levels will personally organize or write articles, frequently check and promote, reflect the work dynamics of various departments and regions in the Taihang area, and exchange work experiences to improve news quality and do more typical comprehensive reporting. It must be understood that only by improving the quality of news can the scope of reflection be expanded; otherwise, with limited space, it will be difficult to meet the requirement of "diverse content with prominent focus."

　　太行新华日报新华分社号召通讯员
    扩大新闻圈为本报写稿
    【本报长治二十七日讯】人民日报出版后，太行新华报与太行新华分社，特号召全体通讯员，扩大新闻圈，提高质量，完成新的任务。略称：为了扩大新闻圈，完成对人民日报稿件的充分供给，我们特号召：（一）每个通讯员同志特别是骨干通讯员同志，要明确自己报导不仅是为了供给太行新华日报，而且应给供人民日报稿件，延安总社对全国广播的稿件。（二）通讯工作薄弱的部门如工厂、矿山、银行、商号、兵营、文化教育、医药卫生、交通、司法、以及薄弱的地区，要求能迅速加强通讯报导工作，大力前进，迎头赶上，尤希各级领导同志亲自动手组织或写稿，经常检查推动，把太行区各个部门，各个地区的工作动态，都反映出来，把工作经验都交流出来，提高新闻质量，多做典型综合报导。须知只有新闻质量提高，才能扩大反映范围，不然有限的篇幅，就很难达到“内容多样而又中心突出”的要求。
