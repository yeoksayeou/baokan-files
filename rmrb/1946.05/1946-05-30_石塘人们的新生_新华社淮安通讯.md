　　The Biggest Happy Event

　　In the rent reduction and anti-traitor movement in Shithang District, when many big landlords calculated the rent refunds, some voluntarily used part of their land to offset the debt because they couldn't refund the grain. As a result, tenants obtained a small amount of land. This was insignificant for the big landlords, but it was the biggest happy event for the tenants.

　　For decades, no, even for hundreds or thousands of years, tenants had never owned land. Their fathers, grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers had always cultivated other people's land. As many tenants said, "Even the place to urinate was the landlord's and had to be rented."

　　But what about now? Many tenants had a foundation to build on, and the "place to urinate" was no longer the landlord's.

　　Tenants in Xu Village, Seqiao West, held a victory and emancipation meeting, with firecrackers exploding and dragon boat dances surging back and forth. They enthusiastically celebrated this biggest happy event.

　　"Congratulations! Congratulations!" Tenants greeted each other with clasped hands and smiles upon entering the meeting place.

　　Yang Liutang had suffered hardships in the past and saved some money, wanting to buy two mu of foundation land, but poor people couldn't buy land. In the end, the landlord Liu Hongru padded the price and bought it. Liu Hongru said to him, "You have the life to buy land, but not the fate to buy the sky!" (meaning that poor people have money to buy land, but the world doesn't belong to the poor, so the land still cannot be bought). This time, when calculating the rent refunds, Liu was willing to offset the debt with land.

　　The landlords made new "contracts" for the tenants. The tenants held the new contracts and discussed how to go to the government to "pay taxes" after the wheat harvest. They treasured the "contracts" as precious heavenly books. Some tenants showed the "contracts" to this person and then to that person, saying to everyone, "Now we can be emancipated!" Those old grandfathers, who were older, said excitedly, "In our lifetime, we have land!"

　　They Were Masters for the First Time

　　Electing the township head was a first in the history of Eqian Township, Shithang District!

　　In the past, the common people had never heard of electing a township head, thinking that "the township head is an official sent from above."

　　But after this rent reduction, the thinking of the common people changed. They thought, "Now that democracy has arrived, the people must be their own masters. To be thoroughly emancipated, we must have a township head who is a leader of the common people."

　　Eighty-odd representatives, carrying the hopes of all the people in the township and with a pair of sharp eyes, were electing the township head in Shu Village.

　　Many of the representatives were women. They were especially happy today because they also participated in the election.

　　The eyes of the representatives were like penetrating mirrors, fixed on the candidates they proposed, wondering which one was good.

　　Seven administrative committee members were elected, very solemnly elected. Among them were two poor peasants, and one each of family members of soldiers, gentry, workers, middle peasants, and rich peasants. Zhao Biwen was elected township head.

　　The newly elected committee members stood in front of the stage awkwardly. The representatives looked at them greedily, like looking at a new bride, at their newly elected leaders. Applause and laughter blended into one.

　　"You must serve us well in the future," the representatives put forward their opinions to the newly elected committee members on the spot. "You must lead us to seek thorough emancipation. Don't be arbitrary in anything, and discuss it with everyone. This is our hope…"

　　"I am a mud leg (Northern Jiangsu dialect, meaning peasant). Since everyone elected me, I will serve everyone well." Zhao Biwen, representing all the committee members, accepted the opinions, his face red, like a big girl: "In the future, I hope everyone will help more. If we have anything wrong, please point it out immediately to help us correct it. If you don't point it out to us, it will harm me and everyone."

　　The representatives left the meeting place and talked and laughed on the way back because they were masters for the first time today.

　　Working Hard on Production

　　Twenty-one villagers from Qiu Village, Shithang District, were digging ditches in Erzigo. They were all newly emancipated peasants. They thought, "This year we must plant autumn crops, and we can't let it be barren like last year."

　　Some people stood at the bottom of the ditch, some people stood at the edge of the ditch, and the silt was transmitted from the bottom of the ditch to the shore with shovels, transmitting, transmitting. The trousers of the people at the bottom of the ditch were rolled up to their knees, and their feet were covered with mud, like wearing a pair of tall, black leather boots.

　　They were laughing, they were working, and the joy in their hearts couldn't stop leaking out of their laughter. The gentle spring breeze blew away the sorrows on their faces.

　　This ditch hadn't been dug for two years. If it wasn't dug, could they still plant rice seedlings?

　　Indeed, the silt in Erzigo had accumulated two or three chi deep. This ditch passed through the river, and the fields on both sides of the river relied on its water every year!

　　"Since the Communist Party came," Wei Jingyuan shoveled a shovelful of mud onto the shore, "the people have had a good life. Leading the people to emancipation, leading the people to production, is all for the people!"

　　Wei Jingyuan wiped the sweat from his head and looked at Xiliuwei, which was close to the west side of Qiu Village. He said, "I heard that each family in Liuwei has formulated a production plan, buying pigs, cutting grass, digging ditches, and repairing vehicles, preparing to work hard on production!"

　　"We must take the lead and work hard! Our Qiu Village also wants to wear a big red flower for digging ditches!" Wei Jingyuan was the captain, and he encouraged everyone with a smile. They had proposed at the meeting to compare, and whoever was good and fast would wear a big red flower.

　　"The Touzigo and Sanzigo are designated for other villages to dig. Why haven't they started work yet?" "Let's do well and give them a push. We don't have to worry about them not digging!"

　　Jin Buyun looked to the south and suddenly said, "Wei Village has also started work. Touzigo is the responsibility of Wei Village." Everyone raised their heads and looked south when they heard him say this. Sure enough, looking over the green rice seedlings, a few heads were exposed on the distant edge of the ditch, and pieces of soil were flying regularly from the bottom of the ditch to the shore.

　　Now who is not happy when production is mentioned? Now everyone is willing to endure hardships, and everyone sees that Wei Village has also started work, and they are all excited.

　　"Who is not happy? Now even suffering is hopeful." Li Fengying stood at the bottom of the ditch and dug a shovel of mud. She was digging the ditch like a man.

　　"Okay, three years later, see what kind of place we are here." Wei Jingyuan said proudly, and a very beautiful vision emerged in everyone's minds, and they all laughed.

　　In the evening, the sun was still ten feet high, and everyone sat on the river bank to rest, smoking dry tobacco.

　　"We have done thirty zhang today!"

　　"How about resting?"

　　"Don't you want to do a little more?"

　　"Okay, let's do a little more."

　　Everyone jumped into the ditch again. Dozens of children and young women were grabbing green grass in the wheat fields, preparing to go back to make fertilizer. A cheerful laughter came from afar.

　　石塘人们的新生——新华社淮安通讯
    淮安石塘区群众运动，本社前已有报导，这篇通讯系叙述群众运动后，人民如何选举政府、如何加紧生产的情形。——编者           
    天大的喜事
    在石塘区这次减租惩奸运动中，许多大地主算退租帐时，因退不出粮，自愿以一部田地抵算，因此佃户获得了少数土地，这在大地主们是无足轻重的，但在佃户却是件天大的喜事。
    佃户们几十年来，不，甚至几百年，几千年来，就不曾有过土地，他们的父亲、祖父乃至曾祖，一直是种人家田的，正如许多佃户所说：“连登尿马子的地方都是主人的，也要包租。”
    但是现在呢？许多佃户有了屋基，“登尿马子的地方”再也不是主人的了。
    色桥西徐庄佃户们开胜利翻身大会，鞭炮连天响，花船高跷子浪过来又浪过去，他们热狂地为他们这件天大的喜事而庆祝。
    “恭喜！恭喜！”佃户们一进会场，都拱手笑着互相道贺。
    杨柳唐过去受苦弄了些钱，想买二亩屋基，但穷人是买不到田的，终于给地主刘鸿如垫价买去了。刘鸿如对他说：“你有命买田，无命买天！”（意思是说穷人有钱买田，但天下不是穷人的，田仍旧买不到的），这次算退租帐，刘愿以田抵算。
    地主们给佃户做了新“契”，佃户们拿着新契都讨论着如何等到麦收下来以后到政府去“税”，他们把“契”当做一份珍贵的天书藏起来，有的佃户把“契”拿给这个人看看，又拿给那个人看看，逢人就说：“现在可翻身啦！”那些年纪大的老爷爷，激动地说：“我们那一世有过田的啊！”
    他们第一次做主人
    选乡长这在石塘区鹅钱乡还是从古到今第一次！
    老百姓过去根本没听说过选乡长这件事，以为“乡长就是上面派下来的官。”
    但在这次减租以后，老百姓的思想发生了变化，他们想：“现在民主来了，人民自己要做主，要想彻底翻身，就要有老百姓自己的带头的乡长。”
    八十几个代表，他们带着全乡人民的希望，带着一双锐利的眼睛，在舒大庄选乡长了。
    代表们很多是妇女，她们今天特别高兴，因为她们也参加了选举。
    代表们的眼睛像透视的镜子，钉住他们提出的候选人转，选那个好呢？
    七个行政委员选出来了，是非常郑重地选出来的，其中贫农两个，抗属、士绅、工人、中农、富农各一个，赵必文做了乡长。
    新选的委员站在台前忸忸怩怩的，代表们像看新娘子似的，贪婪的看着他们新选出的领袖，掌声与欢笑混成一片。
    “你们以后要好好帮我们办事，”代表又当场对新选的委员提出意见，“要领导我们求得彻底翻身，有什么事不能独断独行，要通过大家商量，这是我们的希望”……
    “我是个泥腿子（苏北土语，意即农民），大家既然选举我，我要给大家好好地办事。”赵必文代表全体委员接受了意见，说话脸红红的，像个大闺女：“以后希望大家多帮助，若我们有不对的地方，各位马上提出帮助改正，若对我们不提，害了我，也害了大家”。
    代表们离开会场回去，走在路上还在谈，还在笑，因为他们今天是第一次做了主人。
    下劲闹生产
    石塘区邱大庄二十一个乡民，在二字沟挖沟，他们全是刚翻身的农民，他们想：“今年一定要栽秋，可不能像去年一样的荒下去”。
    有些人站在沟底，有些人站在沟沿下，淤泥从沟底上用锹向岸上传送着，传送着，沟底的人裤管卷在膝盖上，两脚满是泥浆，像穿了一双长统乌黑的皮鞋。
    他们在笑，他们在工作，心里的欢悦止不住从他们的笑声中泄露出来，温和的春风吹去了他们脸上的愁苦。
    这条沟二年没有挖过，再不挖还想栽秧吗？
    真的，二字沟的淤泥已积了二三尺深，这条沟是通过河的，每年两岸的田都是指望它的水呢！
    “自从共产党来，”魏景元一锹把泥摔到岸上，“人民就有了日子过，领导人民翻身，领导人民生产，全是为人民啊！”
    魏景元抹掉了头上的汗，望着紧靠邱大庄西边的西刘圩，他说：“听说刘圩子各家已订出生产计划，买猪、割草、挖沟、修车，预备下劲闹生产啦！”
    “我们要走在头里下劲闹啊！我们邱大庄，挖沟还想带朵大红花呢！”魏景元是队长，他笑着鼓励大家，他们在大会上曾提出比较，谁好谁快就带大红花。
    “头子沟和三子沟规定别的庄子挖，为什么，还不动工呢？”“我们闹好推他一把，不愁他不挖呢！”
    金步云向南望了一望，忽然说：“喂马庄村也动工了，头子沟是马村负责的，”大家听他一说，头都抬起来向南望，果然从碧绿的秧浪上望过去，远远的沟沿上露出几个人头，一块一块的泥土正在规律地从沟底飞到岸上。
    现在提到生产那个不高兴，现在大家苦都苦得有劲，大家看到马庄村也动了工，都兴奋起来。
    “那个不高兴，现在苦也苦得有个盼头。”李凤英站在沟底下挖了一锹泥，她跟男子汉一样地在挖沟。
    “好，三年以后，看我们这里是怎样的一个地方。”魏景元骄傲地说着，大家的脑海里都浮现出一幅非常美丽的远景，他们都笑了。
    傍晚太阳还有丈把高，大家坐在河岸上休息，抽着旱烟。
    “今天闹好了三十丈了！”
    “怎么样歇工吧？”
    “不再闹一小段？”
    “好，就再闹一小段。”
    大家又跳下沟。几十个小孩子、大姑娘在麦田里抢着拔青草，准备回去作肥料，闹嚷嚷的远远地传来了一片欢愉的笑声。
