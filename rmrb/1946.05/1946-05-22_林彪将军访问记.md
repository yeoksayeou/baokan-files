　　A Visit with General Lin Biao
    (New China News Agency Special Correspondent Liu Baiyu)
    One clear morning last month, in the courtyard of a village, this reporter met with General Lin Biao, the outstanding military strategist who is fervently supported by hundreds of thousands of officers and soldiers of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army – their commander-in-chief. Dressed in a plain yellow military uniform and cloth shoes, he calmly and resolutely told the reporter: "The reactionaries have not abandoned their attempts to attack. They have used their most elite New First Army here, but they were eliminated and frustrated south of Sipingjie. This was very unexpected for them, because their estimate was wrong – they thought we were incapable of fighting defensive battles. Now, the front lines are facing each other with fortifications, only fifty meters apart. You can hear the other side talking. I think they will concentrate aircraft, artillery, and tanks to launch a new offensive. However, our defending troops have been tempered in many days of fierce fighting. We hope the enemy attacks, because we feel this will give the invading army more lessons.
    Those who have been promoting and touting the New First Army should now feel ashamed. When they came to the Northeast to carry out an anti-democratic and anti-peace civil war, they hit a hard nail. They once set a deadline to occupy Sipingjie by April 2nd, believing that it would only take two days to get from Changtu to Sipingjie, and that they would reach Changchun by April 5th. In reality, this 120-li road from Sipingjie to Changchun has already taken them more than a month, and the Kuomintang army is still hesitating outside Siping City. Now Sipingjie is a city where all the glass has been shattered, and the dense artillery fire is deafening. In order to seize a twenty-meter high ground in the north, the invaders' corpses cover the green grass. In the first fifteen days, they attacked dozens of times, charging over a hundred times, but the defenders there remained unmoved, as steady as Mount Tai. The New First Army suffered 3,000 casualties and prisoners. It's still like what the old folks in Sipingjie say: 'You can see it, but you can't get in'!"
    General Lin Biao affirmed: "Our morale is very high, our spirit of attack is strong, and we are capable of dealing blows to the reactionaries. The enemy's spirit is gradually waning in fatigue. They fear our army's surprise attacks, bayonet charges, and outflanking maneuvers."
    General Lin Biao was the commander of the famous Pingxingguan battle eight years ago. This time, he is contributing everything to protect the freedom, democracy, and survival of the people of the Northeast. He likes to go to the front lines, but he knows that all wars are mainly determined by ordinary preparations. He doesn't talk much on the front lines, but calmly observes everything and helps commanders sum up experience to guide new actions. Because his summation of experience is targeted at the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, there have been new creations in tactics. These superior tactics have reduced the losses of the Democratic Allied Army and completed several large and small annihilation battles.
    One of General Lin Biao's characteristics is to grasp the center, and then to do extremely deep and meticulous thinking around it, and then to test it in practice. He is a fervent reader of theoretical books. Shortly after he first arrived in the Northeast, he spent several days on the front lines carefully studying "Rectification Documents," especially Chairman Mao's "Rural Survey," which he read after the Xiushuihezi battle. Although military affairs are very busy, he still pays great attention to rural surveys. He sent his only secretary and the head of the Third Section to the countryside to do survey work, and told them in detail what problems to solve, to organize peasants in their struggle, to collect materials, and to understand the peasant problems of the Northeast. When the troops rest, he mobilizes everyone to do mass work.
    In the past six months, General Lin Biao has traveled through the large plains near Jinzhou, Xinmin, Zhangwu, Faku, Fushun, and Sipingjie. In military terms, it can be roughly divided into two stages. In the first period, the reactionaries came with arrogant greed. The people of the Northeast had just been liberated from fourteen years of enemy and puppet long-term oppression. Enemy and puppet remnants were creating chaos in the rear. During this period, the Democratic Allied Army mainly focused on eliminating enemy and puppet remnants, mobilizing the masses, strengthening and expanding the people's self-defense forces, and establishing base areas. Since the battle of Xiushuihezi on February 16th, the Kuomintang army was defeated greatly, but still launched a larger and more frenzied full-scale offensive against the people of the Northeast. This began the second period. Entering this period, the people of the Northeast have been initially organized, and the Democratic Allied Army has established four military regions: Jihei, Jiliao, Liaodong, and Rehe-Liao. Most enemy and puppet remnants and bandits have been eliminated. In the self-defense war, the reactionaries suffered 15,000 dead and wounded, and more than 10,000 were captured.
    "Peace is a definite prospect," General Lin Biao said, "but we must prevent these reactionaries from being able to attack the people. Now we advocate a truce, which American friends and democrats also seem to advocate. We welcome that; but it must be recognized that as long as the reactionaries can continue to fight, they will definitely continue to fight. However, they will continue to be miserably defeated in front of the people. It is impossible to implement dictatorship and autocracy in the Northeast. An army that is separated from the masses loses its soul. This is the situation of the Kuomintang army; when they are combined, the situation improves. This is the situation of the Democratic Allied Army. I still hope that the Kuomintang authorities can stop the civil war, realize peace and democracy, and give the people of the Northeast full freedom and rights."

### 林彪将军访问记

　　林彪将军访问记
    （新华社特派记者刘白羽）
    在上月间一个晴朗的早晨，记者在一处村庄的庭院里，会晤了为东北民主联军数十万指战员所热忱拥戴的卓越的军事战略家——他们的总司令林彪将军，他穿着黄色普通军服，番布鞋子，沉静坚毅的面对着记者说：“反动派没有放弃进攻的企图，他们在这里使用了他们最精锐的新一军，可是他们在四平街以南就受到消灭和挫折，这很出乎他们的意外，因为他们估计是错误了——他们认为我们是不能打防御战的。现在在前线彼此工事对峙，距离只五十米，对方讲话都听得到，我想他们还要以飞机、大炮、坦克集中发动新攻势，不过我们守城部队在多日激战中，已锻炼出来了，我们希望敌人进攻，觉得这样可以使进犯军多得到些教训。
    现在那些为新一军宣传吹嘘的人，应该感到羞耻了，当他们到东北进行反民主和平的内战的时候，已碰了硬钉子。他们曾经限令四月二日占领四平街、认为从昌图到四平街只要两天，而在四月五日赶到长春。实际上，这条从四平街到长春的一百二十里路，已经走了一个多月了，国民党军仍踯躅四平城外。现在四平街是一个所有玻璃都震碎了的城，在那里密集的炮声，使人耳聋。为着争夺北面一块二十米的高地，进犯者的尸体盖满了绿草。在前十五日当中，他们进攻数十次，冲锋一百次以上，但那里的保卫者屹然不动，稳如泰山，新一军伤亡及被俘者三千人。现在还是如四平街老百姓所说的：“看得见，进不来”！
    林彪将军肯定地说：“我们的士气很高，攻击精神很旺，能够给反动派以打击。敌人的锐气在疲惫中逐渐减消了，他们惧怕我军的偷袭、拚刺刀和迂回”。
    林彪将军是八年前著名的平型关大战的指挥者，这次他为了保卫东北人民的自由民主和生存而贡献他的一切，他喜欢到火线上去，但是他知道一切战争主要决定于平常的准备，他在火线上不多讲话，而是冷静的观察一切，并帮助指挥员总结经验，以指导新的行动。由于他的总结经验针对敌方的优缺点，在战术上有了新的创造，这优越的战术，使民主联军减少了损失，而完成了若干大大小小的歼灭战。
    林彪将军的特点之一，是掌握着中心，而后围绕着它去做极深刻细致的思考，然后到实际中去考验。他是理论书籍的热狂的读者，在他初到东北不久时，在前线上他有几天把“整风文献”仔细钻研，特别是毛主席的“农村调查”，就是在秀水河子战役后读的。军务虽然十分繁忙，但他仍极注意农村调查，他把身边唯一的秘书和三科长派到农村去做调查工作，并详细告诉他们要解决些什么问题，要组织农民在他们斗争中来，收集材料，了解东北的农民问题。当部队休息下来的时候，他发动大家去做群众工作。
    半年以来，林彪将军走过锦州、新民、彰武、法库、抚顺和四平街附近一带的大平原，在军事上可以大致划分为两个阶段。第一个时期，那时反动派带着狂妄的贪欲而来，东北人民刚从十四年敌伪长期压迫下解放，后方敌伪残余捣乱，这一时期民主联军主要为肃清敌伪残余，发动群众，加强与扩大人民的自卫力量，建立了根据地。自从二月十六日秀水河子一战，国民党军大败，但仍更大规模更疯狂的向东北人民全面进攻，这就开始了第二个时期。进入这一时期，东北人民已初步组织起来，民主联军已建立了吉黑、吉辽、辽东、热辽四个军区，大部敌伪残余和土匪都被肃清。在自卫战争中，使反动派受到毙伤一万五千人，俘掳万余人。
    “和平是确定的前途”，林彪将军说：“但必须使这些反动派不能够进攻人民。现在我们主张停战，就是美国朋友和民主人士听说也有同样主张，我们是欢迎的；但是要认识，反动派只要能打下去，他一定要打下去的。不过他在人民面前将会不断的惨败，想来东北实行独裁专制，是不可能的。军队如果离开群众，就失去了灵魂，这是国民党军的情形；一结合起来，情形就会上长，这是民主联军的情形。我还是希望国民党当局能够停止内战，实现和平民主，给东北人民以充分的自由与权利。”
