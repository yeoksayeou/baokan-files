The election preparatory committee was jointly initiated and organized at the end of March by the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association, the Shanghai Women's Federation, the China Women's Federation Shanghai Branch, and others. After half a month of enthusiastic preparation, the universal election was held on April 10th. Despite various obstacles, women from all walks of life, including workers, laborers, and students, actively participated in the universal election. A total of 30,000 women participated in the election in eleven electoral districts, with the most enthusiastic voters being working women and student women. The election results were announced on the 60th. The elected representatives included Xu Guangping (cultural circles), Pan Yueying (Huxi female worker), Yang Gang (reporter), and Li Dequan, Shen Zijiu (cultural circles), Hu Ziying (financial circles), and 35 others. After the representatives were selected, the preparatory committee officially sent a telegram to the representatives of various parties in the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the National Government, requesting the government to immediately appoint and announce the list of elected women representatives so that they could attend the meeting in due course.
