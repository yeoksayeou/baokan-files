　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] As the summer harvest approaches, the Kuomintang and Yan Xishan's troops along the borders of our region are actively pursuing their conspiracy to seize grain from the liberated areas by force. A consolidated report follows:
    The Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters of the Kuomintang convened a "Security Conference" on the 17th, gathering high-ranking military officers from its subordinate units and those under its control. Liu Ruming, Deputy Director of the Pacification Headquarters and concurrently Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone, Dong Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang's 38th Army Corps, and Liu Maoen, Chairman of Henan Province, arrived in Zhengzhou before the 17th. Local miscellaneous puppet troops leaders along the Longhai Railway have successively rushed to the meeting. It is known that Liu Zhi personally presided over the meeting. According to insiders, deploying attacks on the liberated areas to seize grain is the main content of this "Security Conference." Sure enough, after the "Security Conference," the puppet Sun Dianying's unit and the Jixian Security Regiment have started seizing wheat in Shangxia Village in the county. The Qixian Security Team has set out to the Third District to seize wheat. The Kuomintang troops in Anyang have already reaped all the wheat within two to three hundred meters around the city.
    In southern Shanxi: The 59th Division of the Kuomintang troops stationed in Shanzhou and Lingbao transported supplies from Shanzhou to Taiyangdu on the north bank of the Yellow River on the 18th, claiming they would enter southern Shanxi to seize wheat within ten days. The 167th Division stationed in Yuncheng and Anyi has forcibly conscripted a large number of laborers in preparation for action. On the 15th, a Kuomintang plane flew to the sky above Wenxi, circling for more than twenty minutes, dropping twenty-three boxes of bullets, four boxes of hand grenades, and 3.4 million legal tender, along with a secret order instructing the Yan Xishan's troops in the city to "cooperate with the Kuomintang troops moving north to seize wheat."
    Yan Xishan's troops stationed in various blockhouses along the Tongpu and Zhengtai Railways are increasingly rampant in their grain-grabbing activities. Before mid-month, they successively convened "village head meetings" in various villages, announcing the so-called "Summer Harvest Discipline," stipulating that whoever fails to complete the summer harvest grain-seizure task will "commit suicide" with a pistol, knife, rope, or poison. Yan Xishan's troops also put forward the slogan: "Rather starve a village of ordinary people to death than let a single Shanxi-Suiyuan soldier starve." On the 13th, Yan Xishan's troops from the Changning stronghold in Yuci suddenly surrounded our Beichao Village, seizing five *shi* of grain, six livestock, and kidnapping five villagers, forcing the village to hand over 50 *shi* of wheat, 320,000 legal tender, and provide 60 laborers. On the 14th and 15th, Yan Xishan's troops continued to Donghao and other villages in Gongcun and Shuangcun, kidnapping people and seizing grain three times, forcing them to pay summer wheat, otherwise they would harvest it on their behalf. Currently, Yan Xishan's troops stationed in the area of ​​Beiheliu Village are vigorously arresting laborers and rushing to build twelve blockhouses to ensure the completion of their armed grain seizure plan, and claiming that Jiang will further invade our liberated area villages such as Beihuangcai. In central Shanxi, Yan Xishan's troops occupying Nanzhuang and Yongkang between Yuci and Taigu are actively repairing the Yuci-Taigu highway to facilitate grain seizure and transportation. Recently, they concentrated six regiments of troops between Yuci and Taigu, and gathered more than 5,000 people in Fenyang and Xiaoyi, preparing to seize wheat. The people in our border areas have been forced to organize themselves to defend their grain, preparing to both harvest quickly and defend themselves.

　　豫北晋南国民党军
    开始出动武装抢麦
    同蒲正太阎军抢粮日益猖獗
    【本报特讯】夏收将至，本区边沿之国民党军与阎军，正积极进行其武装向解放区抢麦的阴谋，兹综合报导如下：
    国民党郑州绥署，于十七日召集所属及在其控制下之部队的高级军官，召开“治安会议”，绥署副主任兼第四绥靖区司令长官刘汝明，国民党三十八集团军总司令董剑，河南省主席刘茂恩，分别于十七日前抵郑。陇海路之地方杂伪部队首脑，已先后赶赴会议，该会由刘峙亲自主持，据知内情者称：进攻解放区部署抢麦为此次“治安会议”之主要内容。果然，“治安会议”结束后，伪孙殿英一部与汲县保安团已到该县上下庄开始抢麦。淇县保安队已出发到三区抢麦。安阳国民党军已将城周二三百米内麦子抢割一光。
    晋南方面：驻陕州与灵宝国民党军五十九师，于十八日由陕州向黄河北岸太阳渡运送给养，扬言于十日内进入晋南抢麦。驻运城、安邑之一六七师已强抓大批民夫准备出动。十五日国民党飞机一架飞至闻喜上空，盘旋二十余分钟，投下子弹二十三箱，手掷弹四箱，法币三百四十万元，并附密令一份，指示该城阎军“配合北上国军出动抢麦”。
    驻扎榆次同蒲正太沿线各碉堡阎军，抢粮活动，正日益猖獗，于本月中旬以前，相继召开各村“闾长会议”，宣布所谓“夏收纪律”，规定：谁若不能完成夏收抢麦任务，谁就以手枪、小刀、绳子、毒药“自裁”。阎军并提出：“宁愿饿死老百姓一村，不能饿死一个晋绥军”的口号。十三日榆次长凝据点之阎军，突然包围我北超村，抢去粮食五石、牲口六头，并绑架村民五人，强迫该村交麦五十石，法币三十二万元，出民夫六十人。十四、十五两天中，阎军继续至巩村双村东郝等村一带，绑人抢粮达三次之多，并迫其缴纳夏麦，否则即代为收割。现北合流村一带据点的阎军，为保证完成其武装抢麦计划，正大肆抓捕民夫，赶修十二座碉堡，并扬言蒋再侵占我北黄彩等解放区村庄。晋中方面，占我榆次、太谷间南庄，永康之阎军，正积极强修榆次通太谷汽路，以便利其抢粮和运输。最近更在榆次、太谷间集中六个团的兵力，在汾阳、孝义集中五千余人，准备抢麦。我边沿区人民为保卫自己的粮食，已被迫自动组织起来，准备一面抢收，一面自卫。
