　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th】 London dispatch: British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons the plan of the British Cabinet Mission regarding the resolution of the Indian question. The main points are as follows: 1. Establish an Indian Federation, including British India and the princely states ruled by various princes. The scope of the federation's power is limited to transportation, diplomacy, national defense, and the collection of finances from the people. 2. The federation will have executive and legislative bodies composed of representatives from British India and the princely states. In the event of major disputes between races in the parliament, a decision requires the agreement of both parties, the  Congress and the Muslim League. 3. All other powers not belonging to the federation remain with the various provinces of British India. 4. The princely states retain all powers except those ceded to the federation. 5. Provinces may freely form provincial unions. 6. Every ten years, each province may, by a majority vote of its parliament, request a reconsideration of the various clauses of the constitution. Regarding the composition of the federal constituent assembly, the plan, using the excuse that the establishment of the assembly will be delayed, advocates not holding universal adult suffrage but using the current provincial assemblies as electoral bodies. Federal deputies will be selected according to the population ratio of each province. The plan also decides not to grant the request of Indian Muslims to establish an autonomous state. The plan finally suggests that British India maintain close ties.
