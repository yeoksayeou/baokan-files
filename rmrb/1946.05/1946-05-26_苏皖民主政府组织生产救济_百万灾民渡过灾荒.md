　　The Suwan Democratic Government Organizes Production and Relief
    Millions of Disaster Victims Overcome Famine
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 23rd] The military and civilians of the Third (Huainan) and Sixth (Huaihai) Sub-districts of the Suwan Liberated Area have overcome the worst famine in forty years, and millions of starving disaster victims have survived. Since last year, the Suwan Border Region has suffered from drought from spring to summer, followed by floods in July, and locust plagues in July and August. Disaster victims account for two-thirds of the total population of the region. The disaster relief movement in the Third Sub-district was carried out from two aspects: organizing disaster victims for production and conducting social relief. In organizing disaster victims for production, the principle of "relying on the mountains for sustenance and relying on the water for sustenance" was implemented, using methods such as chopping firewood, cutting grass, dredging ponds, catching locusts, digging water chestnuts, transporting salt, spinning yarn, and digging lotus roots. According to statistics from Gaobao (newly established county) for the past winter and spring, a total of more than 6,000 households and more than 16,000 people were organized to participate in production, earning more than 120,000 yuan (all in Central China currency, with one yuan equivalent to 30 legal currency). In organizing production, cadres and labor heroes took the lead. The head of Liuqiao District in Xuyi personally went to Sanguan Township to dredge ponds, and the mutual aid group of labor hero Zhang Xingdao in Gaobao saved more than 40 shi of food by eating bean cakes. In addition, the masses were organized to dredge ponds in exchange for work, and more than 10 shi of relief grain were distributed, not only solving the food problem for the disaster victims in this group, but also having surplus grain to help the disaster victims in the township. In terms of social relief, the government distributed more than 14,000 jin of public relief grain and 300,000 dan of bean cakes. More than 28,000 dan of rice were accumulated through work-for-relief. 500 dan of cotton were lent out. 1 million yuan of disaster relief bonds were issued. And 2,800 dan of miscellaneous grains were distributed to disaster victims who dug locusts. In the Sixth Sub-district, five counties including Huaiyin, Lianshui, Shuyang, Guanyun, and Suqian, gained 1.2 million yuan, more than 960,000 jin of grain, more than 430,000 mu of land, 47,000 yuan of righteous relief, and more than 950,000 jin of grain through punishing traitors. Mutual assistance between the rich and the poor, with incomplete statistics from Sishu (newly established county) and Shuyang alone, amounted to 150,000 yuan and 115,000 jin of grain. Various sideline productions, disaster victims in only three counties of Shuyang, Guanyun, and Donghai, obtained 300,000 yuan and 215,000 jin of grain. All government agencies saved a total of 500,000 jin of grain. The Commissioner's Office used work-for-relief to demolish the five rivers and six dams, totaling more than 87,000 cubic meters, and blocked 31 breaches in various trunk rivers, totaling about 160,000 cubic meters, repaired the Wan Gong River and the Hanyang River, totaling about 1.19 million cubic meters, the Huaiyin Min Dai River 2,000 cubic meters, the Xiajia Lake 63,000 cubic meters, the Subei County more than 16,000 cubic meters, the Xiayankou 69,000 cubic meters, and the Lianshui Gongxing River more than 12,000 cubic meters. When the Shuyang Daxin River was completed, the Commissioner's Office allocated 2 million jin of grain. Each county allocated more than 1.7 million jin of grain. Now green beans are on the market, and early wheat is expected to be harvested early. 300,000 disaster victims in the Third Sub-district and 600,000 in the Sixth Sub-district who ran out of food in the spring have overcome the difficult famine.
