　　Our Army Rescues the People from Suffering
    Dongming People Enthusiastically Support the Army
    Kuomintang Planes Bomb Dongming Frenetically for Days
    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 26th dispatch] The liberated people of Dongming enthusiastically comfort the Eighth Route Army, cheering everywhere, "Our own people are here!" Representatives of mass organizations in the county, representing the 150,000 people of the entire county, wrote a letter of appreciation to the Eighth Route Army who liberated Dongming, saying, "Dear comrades: When you complied with the people's request, the people of the whole county instantly transformed from sorrow to joy, from silence to frenzy." More than three hundred mass representatives from over forty villages in the Fifth District of the county, carrying flags, gongs, drums, umbrellas, and gifts such as pigs, sheep, and chickens, traveled thirty li to comfort the frontline commanders and fighters. Mr. Zhao Erxi, a blind old man over seventy years old from Datun Village, brought his only four chickens, held a cane, and personally went to the streets to find the Eighth Route Army to comfort them. Liu, a sixty-year-old tenant farmer from Tangzhuang who came to offer support, took off his clothes to show reporters the scars he received from being innocently beaten by a traitor last November.
    [Our Newspaper, Dongming, 26th dispatch] When our Jilu Yu Eighth Route Army complied with the people's request and entered Dongming city to accept the surrender, thirteen Kuomintang planes flew to Dongming city on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th for continuous bombing and low-altitude strafing, dropping more than fifty bombs in total. The machine gun casings from the strafing had markings such as "17", "B36", and "CB", all of which were American-made. According to incomplete statistics, more than twenty civilians and soldiers were injured, and more than ten civilian houses were destroyed. The people of Dongming are deeply indignant at this atrocity of the Kuomintang.

　　我军解民倒悬
    东明人民热烈劳军
    国民党飞机连日狂炸东明
    【本报荷泽二十六日电】被解放的东明人民，热烈慰劳八路军，他们到处欢呼：“自己人来了！”该县民众团体代表全县十五万人民，给解放东明的八路军写慰问信称：“亲爱的同志们：当你们顺应了人民的请求，全县人民即刻由忧愁变成了喜悦，由沉默变成了欢狂。”该县五区四十余村的三百位群众代表，带着旗锣鼓伞及猪、羊、鸡子等礼物，赶三十里路来慰劳前方指战员。大屯村七十余岁的瞎子赵二喜老先生，拿出仅有的四个鸡子，手持拐杖，亲到街上找八路军慰劳。来慰劳的唐庄六十岁姓刘的佃户，脱下衣服给记者看他去年十一月间无辜被汉奸打的伤痕。
    【本报东明二十六日电】我冀鲁豫八路军顺应人民请求，进入东明城内受降时，国民党飞机十三架于二十二、二十三、二十四连日飞至东明城连续轰炸，并低空扫射，共投弹五十余枚，扫射机枪弹壳上有“１７”、“Ｂ３６”、“ＣＢ”等字样，均为美造。据不完全统计，共伤民众及战士二十余人，毁民房十余间。东明人民对国民党此种暴行，深为愤慨。
