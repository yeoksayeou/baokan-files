　　Ji-Lu-Yu Organs, Schools Mobilize to Accumulate Manure and Cultivate Land
    [Our newspaper Heze dispatch] Organs and schools in various parts of the Ji-Lu-Yu region have launched a production upsurge. The Neihuang County Work Team and Relief Association cultivated one mu of vegetable garden, planted 107 mu of land, and accumulated 46 cartloads of manure, and are now plowing the land in preparation for planting. Auxiliary production yielded a net profit of 25,000 yuan. The Puyang County Government Communications Class reclaims wasteland collectively every day and picks up manure in the morning. Public Security Bureau cadres stand guard for the soldiers at night and pull out soldiers to engage in transportation. All personnel in the Fourth District automatically collect manure: the district chief and assistants take manure baskets with them when they go out or the messengers deliver letters, solving the difficulty of fertilizer shortage. Ai, the district chief of Kunshan Third District, personally led 20 comrades with baskets and rollers to point sorghum eight li away, planting 24 mu in one morning. The masses said: "The district chief is truly a leader of farmers." Hu, the district chief of Juancheng Tenth District, led miscellaneous personnel to plant five mu of land in two days and accumulated 1,200 jin of fertilizer in 20 days. In Qixian, East Henan, the heads of various sections and bureaus personally pulled plows and harrows and planted more than ten mu of crops. Teachers and students of the First Middle School of the Border Region reclaimed more than ten mu of wasteland.
