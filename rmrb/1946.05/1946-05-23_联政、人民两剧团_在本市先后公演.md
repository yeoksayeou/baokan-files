　　United Political and People's Drama Troupes
    Perform Successively in This City
    [This City News] The United Political Drama Troupe, newly arrived from Yan'an, performed famous plays such as "Catching Conscripts" at the City Council Auditorium on the 20th and 21st, entertaining military and political circles. "Catching Conscripts" is a Sichuan dialect drama that reflects the inside story of the Kuomintang's corrupt conscription policies in the rear. It was well-received by audiences when performed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in the past.
    [Further News] To cooperate with the development of the anti-traitor and revenge movement, the Logistics Department's People's Drama Troupe will perform the one-act Yangko opera "Three Sons-in-Law Greet the New Year" at the city's railway station around the 25th of this month. The plot depicts a Kuomintang special agent gradually awakening under the surveillance, help, and lenient policies of the people in the liberated areas, and eventually confessing and embarking on the path of self-renewal.

　　联政、人民两剧团
    在本市先后公演
    【本市消息】新从延安抵此之联政剧团，于二十、二十一两日在本市参议会大礼堂公演“抓壮丁”等名剧，招待军政各界观看。按“抓壮丁”乃四川话话剧，反映国民党在大后方腐败的兵役政策的内幕。过去在陕甘宁边区演出时，曾获观众好评。
    【又讯】为配合反奸复仇运动的开展，后勤部人民剧团将于本月二十五号左右在本市火车站公演《三个女婿拜新年》独幕秧歌剧。剧情是写一个国民党特务在解放区人民的监视、帮助及宽大政策影响下逐渐觉悟，终至坦白走上自新之路。
