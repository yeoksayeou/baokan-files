　　[New China News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd Dispatch] In various parts of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the weather has generally been favorable. In the main wheat-producing areas of Longdong, Guanzhong, and the Suide sub-region, rainfall has been ample. Except for a wind disaster in Chishui County in Guanzhong, a bumper wheat harvest is expected. In the suburbs of Yan'an, wheat seedlings are vigorous and already more than two chi tall. An old farmer in the Chuankou district said, "This year's wheat seedlings are even better than in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930); we can expect an average yield of one dan per mu." The sowing of autumn fields in various places is nearing completion. Due to abundant rain and lush grass this spring, the wheat planting area has been expanded. Wu Manyou Township has decided to weed the fields a second time before the wheat harvest. Because the timely rain, farmers are vying to plant cotton. Qingjian County has already planted more than 45,000 mu. Cotton seedlings in areas like Tianguhai in Yan'an County have sprouted sturdily, and farmers have already begun weeding. It is estimated that each mu will yield a net of seventy to eighty jin of cotton.

　　陕甘宁边区夏收有望
    延安市郊麦色青葱
    清涧一县种棉四万五千亩
    【新华社延安二十二日电】陕甘宁边区各地，大都风调雨顺，主要产麦区陇东、关中及绥德分区，雨量充足，除关中赤水县有风灾外，麦子均可丰收，延安市郊，麦苗旺盛，均已有二尺多高。川口区一老农称：“今年麦苗比民国十九年那年还强，平均每垧可望收到一石。”各地秋田播种，即将完毕，因今春雨多草茂，麦地面积扩大，吴满有乡决定在麦收前，遍锄头次。因天雨适时，农民竞相种棉，清涧县已种了四万五千亩以上。延安县甜谷号一带棉苗已茁壮出土，农民现已开始锄草，预计每垧可收净花七八十斤。
