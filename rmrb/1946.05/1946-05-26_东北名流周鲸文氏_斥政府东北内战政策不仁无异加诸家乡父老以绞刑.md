　　Prominent Northeastern Figure Zhou Jingwen
    Condemns Government's Northeastern Civil War Policy as Inhumane, Tantamount to Applying a Hangman's Noose to His Fellow Villagers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Beiping News: Zhou Jingwen, a leader of the Democratic League and a prominent figure from the Northeast, arrived in Beiping from Chongqing a few days ago. In a conversation with a reporter from this agency, he stated: "The focal point of the current Chinese situation is in the Northeast. The key to the Northeast issue is an immediate ceasefire. A ceasefire in the Northeast is a prerequisite for implementing all resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference." Zhou continued, "He and other Northeastern figures in Chongqing advocate the following for mediating the civil war in the Northeast: 1. The government and the CCP should immediately cease fire, temporarily maintain the status quo, and cease troop movements. 2. Establish a local joint government including all parties and Northeastern figures. 3. Reorganize government and CCP troops and local armies in accordance with the military reorganization agreement." Zhou also summarized his efforts since November of last year in launching an anti-civil war movement, and how he vigorously urged the participating representatives to discuss the realization of a ceasefire in the Northeast during the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. Zhou said, "Apart from a few stubborn individuals within the Kuomintang, all were able to calmly negotiate. He had repeatedly suggested the above proposals to government representatives and CCP representatives, but unfortunately, there was no satisfactory result." Zhou believes that the government's insistence on the civil war policy in the Northeast is unwise and inhumane. Zhou compared the Northeast civil war, with its intermittent fighting and inconsistent urgency, to a hangman's noose being applied to his fellow villagers. He said with indignation, "Ten years of civil war have not yielded any results. If we really continue to fight, the people of the Northeast cannot bear it. The people of the Northeast can only organize to save and defend themselves." He called on the people of the entire nation to unite and intensify the anti-civil war movement.

　　东北名流周鲸文氏
    斥政府东北内战政策不仁无异加诸家乡父老以绞刑
    【新华社延安二十三日电】北平讯：民主同盟领导人之一、东北名流周鲸文氏，日前由渝抵平，对本社记者发表谈话称：“目前中国时局焦点在东北，东北问题的关键在立即停战，东北停战是实行政协一切决议的先决条件”。周氏继称：“他和在渝的东北人士对调停东北内战的主张是：一、政府与中共双方立即停战，暂维现状，并停止运兵。二、成立包括各党派与东北人士的地方性的联合政府。三、按照整军协议整编政府与中共军队和地方军”。周氏复综述他自去年十一月即发起反对内战运动，并曾于政协召开时期，力促与会代表讨论实现东北停战经过，周氏说：“除了国民党内之少数固执人士外，均能平心静气协商，他曾屡将上述主张，建议政府代表与中共代表，不幸终无圆满结果”。周氏认为政府坚持东北内战政策实为不智，亦且不仁。周氏把忽谈忽打，忽急忽松的东北内战，譬作加诸他的家乡父老身上的一种绞刑。他愤慨地说：“打内战十年都没有打出结果来，果真还要打下去时，东北人民实在受不了，东北人民只有组织起来自救自卫”。他呼吁全国人民一致团结起来，加紧展开反内战运动。
