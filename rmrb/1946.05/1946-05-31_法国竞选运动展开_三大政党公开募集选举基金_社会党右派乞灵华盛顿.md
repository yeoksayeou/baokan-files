　　【New China News Agency, Yan'an, 28th】Paris dispatch: On one hand, the people's democratic union; on the other, the reactionaries' increasing arrogance—these are the characteristics of the French election campaign. At the start of the election campaign, the three major French parties all publicly solicited election funds. As of May 23, the Communist Party had raised 6.3 million francs, the Socialist Party had raised 900,000 francs, and the Popular Republican Movement dared not announce its donation figures due to the small amount of funds. Because of this and other similar situations, the French reactionaries placed all their hopes on foreign interference and the right wing of the Socialist Party. "Le Figaro" published an article by American journalist Walter Lippmann, saying: "If the Communist Party comes to power, Anglo-American military intervention will be inevitable." At the same time, Washington has been sending out messages daily, saying that Léon Blum, the right-wing leader of the French Socialist Party, has achieved significant results in his loan activities in the United States. It is said that Blum met with Truman on the 22nd, and on the 24th, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Treasury Secretary Vinson were resolving the details of the Franco-American financial agreement, and a $1.2 billion loan to France will soon be signed. "Paris-Soir" said that the anti-communist article by Socialist Party General Secretary Mayer was written under Blum's direct influence. The newspaper said that Blum called him almost every day from Washington, giving him instructions on the main principles of his election propaganda. The organ of the fascist Republican Liberty Party, "Le Temps," proposed to the Socialist Party that the latter, together with the Popular Republican Movement and others, form an anti-communist French Labour Party, and said that if successful, Blum could be elected as the head of a Labour Party government excluding the Communist Party. "Combat" revealed that another plan of the reactionaries was that if some members of the Socialist Party opposed the establishment of a "Labour Party," then the founders of the party were prepared to expel these members.

　　法国竞选运动展开
    三大政党公开募集选举基金
    社会党右派乞灵华盛顿
    【新华社延安二十八日电】巴黎讯：一方面人民的民主联合，另方面反动派的日益嚣张，——这就是法国竞选运动中的特点。竞选运动开始时，法国三大政党都公开要募集选举基金，迄五月二十三日止，共产党募得了六百三十万法郎，社会党募得了九十万法郎，人民共和党则因款项太少，不敢公布捐款数字。由于这种及其他类似的情况，法国反动派把一切希望，寄托在外国的干涉与社会党的右派身上。“费加拉”报刊载了美国记者李普曼一文说：“如果共产党上台，则英美军事干涉即无可避免。”同时华盛顿则连日发出消息说：法国社会党右派领袖莱翁勃鲁姆，在美国的借款活动，已获得重大成果。据称：二十二日勃鲁姆与杜鲁门会谈，二十四日美国务卿贝纳斯与财长文森，已在解决法美财政协定中的细节问题，十二亿美元的对法贷款即将签字。巴黎循环报说：社会党总书记梅耶的反共文章，即是在勃鲁姆直接影响下写成的。该报说勃鲁姆几乎每天从华盛顿打长途电话给他，指示他竞选宣传的主要原则。法西斯共和自由党机关报《时代报》则向社会党提出，要后者连同人民共和党等组成一个反共的法国劳动党，并说如果成功，则勃鲁姆即可当选为排除共产党在外的劳动党政府的首脑。《抵抗报》揭露说：反动派的另一计划，为如果社会党内有一部分人反对建立“劳动党”，那么，该党创办人准备将这一部分党员排斥出去。
