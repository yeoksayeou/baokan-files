　　【New China News Agency, Hejian, 16th】 The Kuomintang administration in Baoding Prefecture has recently transported a large quantity of firearms and ammunition from Beiping, intending to distribute them to reactionary armed groups such as "Returning Home Regiments" and "Revenge Squads" that invade the liberated areas. The allocation is planned as 400 rifles for large counties and 300 for ordinary counties, each with 100 rounds of ammunition. In dozens of counties already liberated by the Eighth Route Army, there are currently "exiled" illegal county governments residing in Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and other places. They are actively recruiting local thugs and ruffians, or using the method of drawing personnel from fellow-provincial associations, to organize armed groups of various names, preparing to cooperate with Kuomintang regular troops in attacking the liberated areas. On the 27th of last month, the newly formed "Volunteer Assassination Corps" of Wangdu, consisting of over 300 people, fiercely attacked Qiu Village, located sixteen li west of the city. After several assaults, they were all repelled.
　　【New China News Agency, Linyi, 18th】 Wu Huawen's puppet troops in Yanzhou, numbering over a thousand, mobilized at 7:00 AM on the 11th, bombarding villages near Fujialou, Youchengjiao, *Shima, and Hetao Village. They also launched fierce attacks from Gucheng towards the Eighth Route Army's garrison. After the garrison defended itself, they were routed.
