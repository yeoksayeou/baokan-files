    Calls for Halting the Northeast Civil War
    Criticizes the Kuomintang Reactionaries for Violating Agreements
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] Kunming Democratic Weekly, Volume 3, Issue 6, published a commentary, "Immediately Halt the Northeast Civil War," stating: "The Kuomintang's reactionary elements, in violation of agreements between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, have continuously sent large armies into the Northeast, causing conflict and delaying the political resolution of the Northeast issue. This is another concrete manifestation of their attempt to overthrow the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) agreements. The reactionaries feel that partially overturning the achievements of the PCC agreements politically is not enough, and therefore they are further attempting to use military force to provoke a civil war, thereby comprehensively overturning the PCC agreements. Therefore, they are seizing the Northeast issue, desperately attempting to place the Northeast outside the ceasefire zone, in order to fulfill their conspiracy to re-ignite a nationwide civil war." It then points out: "If the reactionaries' conspiracy to expand the conflict in the Northeast cannot be stopped immediately, what will follow will be a nationwide civil war filled with the din of gunfire. The situation of peace and democracy will suffer a terrible destruction." The magazine stated: "We call on the people of the whole country to raise their vigilance and prepare to immediately use action to stop the reactionaries' conspiracy." At the same time, it also hopes that the Kuomintang authorities will take into consideration the wishes of the people of the Northeast and use negotiations to resolve the political issues that exist in the Northeast."

    呼吁制止东北内战
    抨击国民党反动派违反协议
    【新华社延安二十七日电】昆明民主周刊三卷六期刊载时评“立即制止东北内战”文称：“国民党的反动分子违反国共双方协议，以大军源源开入东北，引起冲突，拖延东北问题的政治解决，是其推翻政协会协议的又一具体表现。反动派觉得在政治上部分推翻政协协议的成果还不够，因此更企图进一步用军事力量挑起内战，进而全面推翻政协协议。因此抓紧东北问题，极力企图将东北划在停战圈外，以便逞其重新挑动全国性内战的阴谋”。接着指出：“反动派在东北扩大冲突的阴谋，如果不能即时制止，接着来的，将是一个炮火喧天的全国性内战。和平民主局面，将遭到可怕的毁灭”。该杂志称：“我们呼吁全国人民提高警觉，准备即时用行动去制止反动派的阴谋”。同时并希望国民党当局，顾全东北人民的愿望，用谈判方式，解决东北所存在的政治问题”。
