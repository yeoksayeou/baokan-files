    Immediately Mobilize to Defend the Wheat Harvest in the Border Areas
    [Xinhua Taiyue Branch Agency Yangcheng 24th Dispatch] Taiyue Xinhua Daily published an editorial titled "Immediately Mobilize to Defend the Wheat Harvest in the Border Areas." It began by stating: "The wheat ripening season is coming in the blink of an eye, and Yan Xishan's various organizations are again busily plotting to seize the people's wheat. On the one hand, they are conducting a rumor offensive, falsely claiming that our army is preparing to seize wheat, and on the other hand, they are intensifying their arrangements in terms of institutions, manpower, and furniture. The Yan army has made meticulous plans for this year's grain seizure, and the scale and methods of its robbery will inevitably be larger and more vicious than in the past. Therefore, this year's struggle against grain seizure will definitely be exceptionally complex, serious, and arduous. If there is a thought that the War of Resistance has been won, or that many successful defenses of the wheat harvest have been carried out during the War of Resistance, or that mass movements have seen broad development this year, and thus this serious struggle is underestimated, it will inevitably lead to serious consequences. Therefore, all cadres and masses in all systems in the border areas must ideologically recognize the seriousness of this issue and the sharp and cruel nature of the anti-grain seizure struggle, and must not allow the slightest degree of paralysis and relaxation. They should strengthen their fighting spirit, raise their vigilance, closely monitor every conspiracy of the Yan army, and actively seek countermeasures to victoriously complete the task of anti-nibbling and anti-grain seizure."
    The editorial continued: "The most basic thing is to launch a mass anti-grain seizure struggle, calling on the masses to mobilize to defend the fruits of their own struggle, to defend the fruits of their own labor, and to defend the crystallization of their own blood and sweat. Implement resolute self-defense against all offensives of the reactionaries' nibbling and grain seizure, and completely and thoroughly eliminate them, not allowing them to seize a single grain. In short, the fruits that the masses have obtained through blood and sweat must never be taken away by the reactionaries and used as their evil capital to slaughter and oppress the masses. Secondly, to complete this complex task, we must rely on strong organizational strength. The leadership should be good at adapting to the specific circumstances and characteristics of the local area, both past and present, and accept the experiences of anti-grain seizure over the past few years, especially the experiences of organizing the masses through labor-military integration, joint villages, joint defense, mutual aid, and labor exchange teams, to achieve the goals of rapid harvesting, rapid fighting, rapid hiding, and defending grain. It is even more important to give full play to the past habit of mountain people going to the plains to harvest wheat and the spirit of mutual assistance, and to call on the militiamen in the hinterland to organize large and small armed labor exchange teams to go to the border areas to help with the rush harvest. The nature of this should mainly be wage labor, and once a battle occurs, they should cooperate with the local armed forces and participate in self-defense operations. Therefore, first of all, we should establish close contact with the local command and militia to better exert our strength and achieve victory in the anti-grain seizure struggle. Thirdly, in the extremely tense anti-grain seizure struggle, in order to organize the masses well and exert their full power, it is also necessary to unify and strengthen the leadership of the command at all levels in the border areas. First of all, we must ideologically overcome certain tendencies towards independent action and form a strong and powerful core in the leadership organization to unify steps and unify actions."
    Finally, it proposed: "How to resolve the contradiction between defending the wheat harvest and mobilizing the masses in the border areas? We believe that it should not be rigidly opposed, because if the masses suffer losses in production, it will also reduce the masses' morale and affect the development of mass movements. Similarly, if the masses cannot be mobilized, the defense of the wheat harvest will lose its guarantee. Therefore, at a certain period of time, we should separate the priorities and focus on grasping the key points. In areas where the struggle is most tense and fierce during the wheat harvest, we should be good at adapting to the emotions and demands of the masses and focus on defending the wheat harvest. Defending the wheat harvest is also defending the fruits of the masses' struggle. Time is quite pressing, and we should quickly and fully prepare our forces to thoroughly smash the reactionaries' conspiracy of nibbling and grain seizure."

　　太岳新华日报著论
    立即动员起来保卫边沿区的麦收
    【新华太岳分社阳城廿四日电】太岳新华日报以《立即动员起来保卫边沿区的麦收》为题发表社论，首称：麦熟期转瞬就要到来，阎锡山的各级机构，又在紧张布置抢夺人民麦子的阴谋，他们一面进行谣言攻势，诬称我军准备抢麦，一面从机构人力、家具各方面加紧布置。阎军对今年的抢夺民麦，已作周密的计划，其抢劫的规模与方式，必较过去更为庞大，更为毒辣。因之今年的抢粮与反抢粮斗争，一定是异常复杂严重与艰苦的，如果存在着抗战胜利了，或抗战中进行过许多次的胜利的保卫麦收，或者以为今年群运有广大发展等，而就轻视这一严重斗争的思想，必将招致严重的后果。所以一切边缘地区各系统的干部及群众，必须从思想上认识这一问题的严重性和反抢粮斗争的尖锐残酷，绝不容有丝毫的麻痹和松懈，应加强斗志，提高警惕，严密注视阎军每一个阴谋活动，而积极谋取对策，要胜利的完成反蚕食、反抢粮的任务。
    该社论继指出：最基本的就是展开群众性的反抢粮斗争，号召群众为保卫自己斗争的果实，为保卫自己劳动的果实，保卫自己血汗的结晶而动员起来。对反动派的蚕食和抢粮的一切进攻，实行坚决的自卫并彻底的干脆的消灭它，不让它抢去一颗粮食。总之，群众流血流汗得来的果实，绝不能让反动派夺去，再作为它屠杀压迫群众的罪恶资本。其次要完成这一复杂的任务，必须依靠坚强的组织力量，领导上应善于根据当地过去和现在的具体情形与特点，接受几年来反抢粮的经验，尤其是劳武结合、联村、联防、变工、扎工等组织起来的经验，将广大群众组织起来，以达到快收、快打、快藏，保卫粮食的目的。更能发挥过去山地群众，到平原割麦的习惯和互助精神，号召腹地民兵群众，组织大小武装扎工队到边缘区去帮助抢收，其性质则主要是卖工，而一旦发生战斗，即应配合当地武装，参加自卫作战。因此首先应与当地指挥部和民兵取得密切联系，以更好发挥我们的力量，取得反抢粮斗争的胜利。第三、在极紧张的反抢粮斗争中，要把群众组织得好，发挥出高度的威力，还必须统一与加强边缘区各级指挥部的领导，首先从思想上克服某些各自为政的偏向，在领导组织上形成强有力的核心，以统一步调，统一行动。
    最后提出：在边缘区如何解决保卫麦收和发动群众工作的矛盾，我们认为不应把它死板地对立起来，因为如果群众生产上受到损失，也会降低群众情绪，影响群运的发展。同样群众发动不起来，保卫麦收也就失掉了保证。因之，在一定的时间内，分开先后缓急来抓住重点进行。在麦收时间斗争最紧张剧烈的地区，就应善于适应群众的情绪和要求，以保卫麦收为中心。保卫麦收也就是保卫了群众的斗争果实。时间已相当紧迫，应迅速充分准备好我们的力量，彻底粉碎反动派蚕食抢麦的阴谋。
