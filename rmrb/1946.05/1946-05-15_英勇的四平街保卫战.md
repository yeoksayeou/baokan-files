　　The Heroic Defense of Siping Street
    Liu Baiyu
    The reporter has been traveling through the fiercely contested front lines all day. The defense of Siping Street has entered its twenty-fourth day. Here, the people's loyal guards have written the most heroic page. For more than twenty days, this piece of land has been under relentless bombardment. The New First Army, equipped with American weapons and possessing a menacing brutality, once launched a fierce attack with an average firing rate of thirty shells per minute. But they were stopped. The glorious Siping Street front line remained stubbornly unyielding, like a stone mountain. Siping Street, at the intersection of two railways, is a city with tens of thousands of people. To be fair, it is not a particularly strategic or dangerous place. There are only one or two high points nearby, and a small river in front. The reactionary army attacked the city simultaneously from the south, southwest, and part of the northwest. The sound of artillery could be heard from thirty miles away. The soldiers resolutely carried out their tasks in their low bunkers.
    When they first entered these bunkers, the company commander of the Tenth Company, the political instructor, and their platoon leader swore to everyone: "I vow to hold this place to the death, and even in death, my body will block the enemy!"
    After the intensely stressful first day of fighting, suddenly—from one company to one battalion, and then from one battalion to one regiment—this oath spread to become everyone's motto. They meticulously recorded it under the intense artillery fire, writing it in letters to their beloved and trusted commander, Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao. In the raging storm and rain, the soldiers fired from the bunkers during the day and used the sturdy blockhouses to resist at night. In one bunker, which was a heavy machine gun position for a squad, the right wall inside the work area read: "Aim Accurately and Shoot." The left wall read: "Fear No Sacrifice or Bloodshed." The front was numbered, indicating the positions of the shooter and grenadier. I firmly believe that our soldiers have a deep affection for their positions. During the battle, one squad was reduced to just two men: Squad Leader Wan Jinhe and soldier Xia Jingchun. They finally resolved that the squad leader said: "As long as we're alive, we can't let the position fall. We'll prepare our grenades and hit them when they come up." Sure enough, the reactionary forces launched three frontal assaults on this position with a company, but they were all repelled. They persisted for a day and a night. At dawn, new troops came to relieve them for rest, and they were still reluctant to leave their beloved position.
    I understand, I know why they have such spirit. The other day, on a dry and hot dusk, I was on a dust-covered street. I saw a stretcher team coming from the front line. I spoke to one of them, a young man named Zhang, a leatherworker who lived on Siping Street's Third Road. He told me enthusiastically: "Comrade, the Kuomintang can't get in. At first, they said they wouldn't eat if they didn't get in within three days, but then they said a week. Now I hear they're saying maybe a month." He was a very humorous and interesting person, but his confidence came from the reality of more than twenty days of iron and blood. I asked him why, and he simply replied: "Even if airplanes and cannons level Siping Street, we won't retreat. What use is it?" This is the source of invincible strength. The masses of Siping Street are not lovers of war. They are hopeful for peace. Just the day before the war, twenty thousand representatives of families, representing two hundred thousand citizens, signed a petition requesting peace, intending to send it to the executive group in Shenyang. When peace became hopeless, they heard that the "bandits" were coming again (they hated the reactionary troops, calling them "bandits"; while the Democratic Allied Army was whom they had written to invite). They silently and resolutely stood beside the Democratic Allied Army soldiers and began digging fortifications. Seven thousand people did this. But they were concerned: Could these brothers withstand the "monkey team" (they called the New First Army soldiers in American uniforms the "monkey team")? Flames flickered, and a barrage of artillery roared like an avalanche. Our district government cadres stood on the lookout post, marking down each round with a pencil, unable to keep up with the dense sound of artillery. Everyone was concerned about the front line, watching two messengers run forward but unable to get through, falling to the ground. Half an hour later, a call came from the front line, the voice of the company commander: "The position is good, only one man injured, please reassure the leaders." At this point, the people laughed heartily. Now they are very happy to hear the artillery fire. They say to the comrades in the army: "We are happy when we hear that you are fighting well."
    One day, as the sun was setting, the enemy's firepower subsided. Suddenly, the people of the three districts east of the railway crowded into the government, saying to the district head: "The comrades at the front are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves for us, the people. We have prepared some biscuits and eggs to comfort the comrades." The district head said, "The target is too big, I am afraid of losses," and advised them not to go, but no one was willing. Later, they thought of a way, which was to elect representatives to go to the front line. The soldiers poked their heads out of the fortifications and said: "For the peace and democracy of the Northeast, this is nothing."
    In these difficult days, because of the blood that flowed together, the army and the people in Siping Street formed a steel-like bond.
    Now, during the day, every household stays indoors. They have dug cellars in their courtyards, and at night they cover the windows with black cloth so that no light from the electric lamps can be seen. The power lines are often broken by artillery fire at night, and the municipal government leads some workers to repair them during the day. Cars patrol the streets day and night, and the main streets are covered with sandbag fortifications.
    According to statistics from the first fifteen days, a total of fifty-five people died and one hundred and forty-three were injured in the five districts of Siping Street. Hundreds of houses were destroyed.
    The numbers of sacrifices and losses have aroused not fear, but the flames of resentment!
    An old man was hit in the knee by shrapnel, which penetrated the bone. He was immediately sent to the hospital. Immediately, the district head and the secretary of the Communist Party district committee came to see him and brought him eggs, telling him that he had been allocated ten mu of enemy-occupied land. The old man said: "I have never seen our people being injured being treated the same as the comrades. The district head even came to see me. I am fifty-eight years old and I have never seen such a good army. In my life, I have finally seen good people." And the government has become the leader and protector of the people in the war. When houses are destroyed, the government immediately allocates public housing to them. The injured are sent to the hospital, with thirty-five yuan per day provided. Those with financial difficulties are also given sorghum. For those killed by artillery fire, the government buys coffins and buries them, and also provides families with a condolence payment of one thousand yuan and one hundred jin of sorghum, as well as a long-term pension certificate. Now, in order to solve the problem of everyone's vegetables, temporary cooperatives have been organized in each district, using soybeans to sprout bean sprouts and make tofu. District cadres investigate the beans and oil stored in various stores throughout the city. With the consent of the merchants, they sell them to those in need and turn the money earned over to the stores. In this fully organized war, two newspapers are published in the city, one is the mimeographed *Fighting Siping Street* for the troops, and the other is the typeset *News Bulletin* for the people. The latter newspaper sells three thousand copies. It is inconvenient for the people to go out in the artillery fire, so the district cadres deliver the newspapers to their doors. These heroic workers often do not sleep for several nights, and they are for the people and closely with the people. The people of Siping Street said: "Defeat them, let them see, and don't let them in!" On the other hand, those prisoners of war who are tired of war are saying: "We have crossed over. Among the people we have visited, we found that they like to say: From what time did I come over, or 'From what time did I lay down my gun?'"
    Once, a symposium of prisoners of war was held in the war political department. A young platoon leader said: "At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to save the country from danger, I left my fairly wealthy family and enthusiastically went to serve in the army. I never expected to be forced to fight in a civil war...!" As he spoke, he cried. At this time, a battalion commander named Guo Chaonan, from Qinghua County, Henan, suddenly stood up with tears streaming down his face and said loudly: "Report to the chairman, today I have woken up from a big dream and realized that I was wrong in the past. I know that the responsibility for the civil war does not lie with the Communist Party, but with those reactionaries." At this time, he excitedly shouted: "Support the Democratic Allied Army who has made contributions to the liberation of the Northeast!" The whole audience was moved. Then, he sincerely said: "I know that I do not meet the conditions to join the Communist Party, but I am willing to further understand and work hard, and I hope to be a Communist Party member in the future." He cried and went to the rear hospital for recuperation with tears.
    It is not easy to go from darkness to light. The reactionaries have tried various methods to make their soldiers stupid.
    The New First Army was initially so arrogant and swaggered into the Northeast, but there is only one problem that the Kuomintang authorities cannot solve, that is, after the war, the officers can no longer preserve their deception. The soldiers know that the other side is not bandits, because there is no place in the world where there are such bandits: prisoners are not buried alive or skinned, but receive warmth. In the more than twenty days of the Siping Street War, the soldiers' emotions have undergone significant changes, on the one hand, decline and wavering; on the other hand, rising and firming. The soldiers of the New First Army began to secretly hide the leaflets of the Democratic Allied Army in their close-fitting pockets, and secretly took them out to read during breaks in the fighting.
    When I arrived at the front, I saw a large cart, sending a dozen prisoners of war back, full of officials, each receiving cigarettes and travel expenses.
    Not long ago, the reactionaries in Jinshanbao suffered a blow, and more than two hundred wounded soldiers were abandoned on the position. They wailed and groaned. Later, the comrades of the Democratic Allied Army carried them on stretchers to rooms covered with straw, fed them meals. Two days later, they sent them back in several carts—this made countless soldiers of the 71st Army understand the truth.
    When returning by train, there were three gunners in gray American uniforms in the same carriage. They told me: "We don't approve of fighting a civil war, that's all."
    The heroic people of Siping Street will forever remain in my memory—when I looked from the carriage at the endless fertile fields of the Northeast on both sides, I admired the heroes, Siping Street is using its chest to resist artillery fire and poisonous arrows for the peace and democracy of the entire Northeast. Siping Street is not alone, the people of the entire Northeast will reach out to you, their eyes are watching Siping Street, and their strength is concentrated on you. Siping Street is not only for the Northeast, but also for China. The struggle between democracy and anti-democracy, the bright future, is developing in this important time.

　　英勇的四平街保卫战
    刘白羽
    记者整日穿行在激战的阵地上，四平街的保卫战已进至第二十四天了。在这里，人民的忠实的警卫员们，写下了最英勇的一页。二十几天以来，这一块土地，无时不在残酷的轰炸之中，那些带着逼人的凶暴而来的美械装备之新一军，曾经以每分钟平均卅发炮弹的火力猛攻，但他们被阻止住，光荣的四平街第一线顽强不屈，它如同一座石山。四平街在两条铁路交叉的十字口上，是一个有几万人口的城市。公允的说，这里不是什么稀奇险要的地方，附近只有一二处高地，前面有一条小小的河流。反动派的军队从南面、西南和西北面的一部分同时向这个城攻击，炮声从三十里以外就听到了。战士们在他们底矮的堡垒里，坚决地执行任务。
    当他们第一次走进这些地堡，十连的连长、政治指导员和他们排长，同大家宣誓：“我誓死坚持这里，死了也要把尸体拦阻着敌人”！
    严重紧张的第一天打击以后，突然——由一个连传播到一个营，一个营扩大到一个团，这话成为大家的话，他们在炽烈的炮火之下，缜密地把它记录下来，写成信，写给他们挚爱而信赖的指挥者林彪总司令。在暴风春雨之中，战士们白天从地堡射击，夜晚里利用坚固的碉堡抵抗。在一个地堡里，那是一个班的重机枪阵地，在工车里边的右壁上写着：“正确瞄准射击”，左壁上写着：“不怕牺牲流血”，正面写着号码，那里是射击手和掷弹手的位置。我很相信，我们的战士对于他们的阵地有很深的感情，在作战当中，有一个班最后只剩下两个人，班长万金合和战士夏景春，他们最后下了决心，班长说：“只要咱们活着，就不能叫阵地丢了，我们把手榴弹准备好，上来就打他”。果然，反动派一个连在这阵地上前冲了三次，都被打退了。他们坚持了一天一夜，天明以后，新的部队来换他们下去休息，他们对他们亲爱的阵地，还是恋恋不舍。
    我很了解，我很知道他们为什么具有这样的气概。前两天，一个干燥发热的黄昏，我在满蔽尘土的街道上。看到从前线阵地上来的担架队，我跟其中一个姓张的、住四平街三马路作皮匠的年青人谈起来，他热诚的告诉我：“同志，国民党进不来了，他们开头说三天不进来就不吃饭，可是后来又说一个星期，现在又听说大概一个月了”。他是一个十分幽默有趣的人，但他的自信来自这二十多天的铁与血的实际，我问他为什么，他简单的回答：“飞机大炮把四平街炸平，我们不退还是没用呀”！这就是无敌力量的来源。四平街的群众不是战争的爱好者，他们是和平的盼望者，就在战争前天，他们中间还有两万家长代表二十万市民签名，要求和平，想送给沈阳的执行小组。当和平无望了，他们听说胡子又要来了（他们憎恨反动派队伍，叫做胡子；而民主联军是他们写信请来的），他们沉默而坚毅地走到民主联军战士的身旁掘起工事来了。这样作的有七千人。但是他们心中悬虑着：这样的兄弟顶得住“猴子队”（他们叫那些穿美军服装的新一军为猴子队）吗？火光闪烁，一阵炮火排山倒海地响来，我们区政府的干部站在了望哨上，用铅笔一道道划着，记不下那紧密的炮声。大家关心着第一线，眼看着两个通讯员望前跑而跑不过去，伏倒地下了。半小时后，第一线打来电话，是连长的口音：“阵地很好，只伤一个人，请首长放心”。这时老百姓笑得裂开了嘴。现在他们每天听到炮声很高兴，他们对部队同志说：“我们听了打得好”。
    一天夕阳西沉的时候，对方火力沉寂了，忽然铁路东三个区的老百姓拥挤到政府来，跟区长说：“前方同志为我们老百姓流血牺牲，我们准备些饼干鸡蛋慰劳同志们”。区长说：“目标太大，怕受损失”，劝他们不要去，可是谁也不肯，后来想个办法，就是选举代表到火线上。战士从工事里伸出头说：“为了东北的和平民主，这算不了什么”。
    在艰难的日子里，由于血流在一起，部队和人民在四平街造成钢一样的结合。
    现在，白天家家户户都在家里，他们在院里掘了地窟，晚间在窗上遮了黑布，不让电灯光露出一点来，电线夜里给炮火炸断，市政府领导着一部分工人，白天又把它修好。日夜都有汽车在街上巡逻，大街上到处是沙袋堆的工事。
    根据前十五天的统计，四平街五个区共死五十五人，伤一百四十三人，毁房屋数百间。
    这个牺牲损失的数字，引起的不是恐惧，而是愤恨的火焰！
    一个老年人被弹片伤了膝盖，打入骨中，立即被送进医院，马上区长和共产党区委书记来看他，还带了鸡蛋，告诉他，他已经分到十亩敌伪土地，这老年人说：“从没见过我们老百姓挂了彩，跟同志们一样看待，区长还来看我，我五十八岁了，没见过这样好的军队，这一辈子总算叫我看见好人了”，而政府在战争中成为人民的首脑和保护者。房屋被毁了，政府立刻调剂公共房屋给他们，负伤的政府送进医院，每天三十五元，生活困难的，还发高粱给他们，被炮火轰死者，政府买棺木入土，还抚恤家庭一千元和一百斤高粱，还发给一个长期抚恤证。现在为了解决大家的吃菜，各区都组织了临时合作社，用大豆生豆芽制豆腐，区干部调查全市各商店储蓄的豆和油，征得商人同意，代为卖给需要的人家，把卖得的钱再转给商店。在这完全组织起来的战争里，城里出版有两种报纸，一种是给部队看的油印报战斗四平街，另一种是给老百姓看的铅字报新闻简讯。后一种报销售三千份。老百姓不便在炮火中外出，都是经过区干部送到门里面去。这些英勇的工作者，常常是几夜不睡，他们为了人民并和人民紧紧地在一起。四平街的人说：“打垮他们，叫他们看得见，进不来！”另一方面，那些厌战的俘虏在说：“我们过来了，在我们所访问的老百姓中间发现他们喜欢说：打从什么时候我就过来了呦，或者“从什么时候我放下了枪杆？”
    一次，在战争政治部里开了一个俘虏座谈会，一个青年排长说：“抗战开始，我为了挽救国家危亡，离开了自己相当富裕的家，满腔热血的去当兵，没想到在被逼着打内战……”！说着他哭了。这时，一个营长叫郭朝南，河南清化县人，得了急病，突然满脸流着泪，站起来大声说：“报告主席，我今天如大梦初醒，知道过去做错了，我知道内战责任不在共产党，是在那些反动派”。这时，他激动的高呼：“拥护解放东北有功的民主联军”！全场都感动了。接着，他诚挚的说：我知道我参加共产党条件不够，但我愿意进一步了解和努力，希望将来做一个共产党员”。他哭了流着泪走向后方医院去休养了。
    从黑暗到光明，不是一件容易的事，反动派想过种种方法，使他们的士兵变得愚蠢。
    新一军起初那样自大狂妄，摇摇摆摆的到了东北，但只有一个问题，国民党当局是无法解决的，那就是在战争一接触之后，长官便无法再保存他们的欺骗。士兵知道，对方不是土匪，因为世界上没有任何地方有这样的土匪：俘虏没有受到活埋或剥皮，而得到的是温暖。在四平街战争的二十多天内，士兵的情绪有着显著的变化，一方面是下降、动摇；另一方面却是上升、坚定。新一军的士兵开始把民主联军的传单秘密藏在贴身的口袋里，在战斗间隙时偷偷地拿出来看。
    我到前方就看到一辆大车，送十几个俘虏回去，满车官员，每人得到香烟和路费。
    不久以前，在金山堡反动派遭受了打击，二百多伤兵被丢弃在阵地上，他们哀号呼吟，后来民主联军的同志们把他们用担架抬到铺满稻草的房内，喂他们吃饭，两天之后，用几辆大车把他们送了回去——这使七十一军的无数士兵明白了真相。
    乘火车回来时，同车就有三个穿着灰色美军服装的炮手，他们告诉我：“我们不赞成打内战，这就是一切”。
    四平街英勇的人们，永远留在我的记忆里面——当我从车厢上望着两边无际的东北丰饶的原野的时候，我崇敬英雄，四平街在为整个东北的和平民主而用胸膛抵住炮火与毒箭。四平街不是孤单的，全东北人民会把手伸向你，眼睛望着四平街，把力量集中向你。四平街不仅是为了东北，也是为了中国。民主与反民主的斗争，光明的前途，是在这重要的时间内发展着。
