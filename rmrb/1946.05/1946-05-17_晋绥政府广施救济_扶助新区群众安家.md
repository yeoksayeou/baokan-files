　　Jin-Sui Government Broadly Provides Relief
    Helping Masses in New Areas Settle Down
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 12th] The democratic government is making every effort to abolish donations and taxes, and broadly provide relief to help the masses in newly liberated areas settle down and start their businesses. In Liangcheng County alone, more than 40 kinds of donations and taxes stipulated by the puppet Mengjiang government were abolished, with the tax amount reaching 160 million yuan, land tax of 135.564 million yuan, and special tax on opium prohibition of 11 million yuan, greatly reducing the burden on the people. According to incomplete statistics from more than 20 counties including Xiaoyi and Wenshui: since last autumn, more than 210,000 *shi* of relief grain and loans of 70 million yuan for various industries such as agriculture, industry, and commerce have been issued. For example, the Zhuozi Mountain City government issued grain and money twice, enabling the broad masses to avoid freezing and starvation and transition to production. In the rural areas of Zhongyang, Daning, Yonghe and other places in southwestern Shanxi, due to the heavy destruction by the enemy puppets and Yan's troops, the grain shortage was extremely serious. Our government and trade organizations transported 20,000 *shi* of grain for relief.

　　晋绥政府广施救济
    扶助新区群众安家
    【新华社兴县十二日电】民主政府竭力取消捐税，广施救济，扶助新解放区群众安家立业。仅凉城县即取消伪蒙疆政府所订捐税四十余种，税额达一万万六千万元，田赋一万万三千五百六十四万元，禁烟特税一千一百万元，大大减轻了人民负担。孝义、文水等二十余县，据不完全的统计：自去秋以来，放救济粮达二十一万余石，农工商业各种贷款达七万万元，如卓资山市政府曾两度发放粮款，使广大群众得免于冻馁，并转入生产。晋西南之中阳、大宁、永和等地农村，因受敌伪阎的惨重破坏，粮荒至为严重，我政府和贸易机关运往粮食二万石救助。
