　　Glorious Battle of Siping Street
    Liberation Daily Editorial, 21st
    After inflicting significant blows and casualties on the invaders, the Democratic Allied Forces in Siping Street have strategically withdrawn from their positions on the 20th.
    The valiant defenders of Siping Street have gloriously completed their mission. In over thirty days of bloody combat, regardless of the intensity of the bombardment from the enemy's American-made planes, artillery, rocket launchers, and tanks, the defenders of Siping Street demonstrated an iron will, inflicting tens of thousands of casualties on the invaders, causing the Kuomintang soldiers to begin to feel war-weariness, and giving the reactionaries the punishment and lessons they deserved! The Kuomintang reactionaries had set a deadline of April 2nd to capture Siping Street. They blindly believed in the omnipotence of foreign weapons and underestimated the strength of the people of Northeast China, thinking the Democratic Allied Forces were no match. They fully expected to take Siping Street in one fell swoop. Their news agency, the Central News Agency, even twice spread rumors of having occupied Siping Street (on April 15th and 18th). He Yingqin even personally announced on May 9th that the Kuomintang army had reached south of Gongzhuling. However, the Battle of Siping Street, lasting for more than a month, left the reactionaries battered and bruised, shattering their plan and myth of quickly capturing Siping Street! The Battle of Siping Street brilliantly demonstrated the great self-defense strength of the people of Northeast China in striving for peace and democracy. This battle made an extremely significant contribution to the cause of peace and democracy throughout China. It will be forever recorded in the history of the Chinese people's liberation!
    The Chinese people sing praises of the heroic deeds of the defenders of Siping Street, and at the same time curse the reactionaries for their despicable shamelessness! The reactionaries followed a policy of non-resistance, surrendering Northeast China. The planes, tanks, and all the weaponry they received from the United States were never seriously used when the Japanese invaders rampaged through China. However, when the Northeast comrades had been liberated from the iron heel of the Japanese invaders and began to establish a peaceful and democratic life, the reactionaries launched "fierce battles unprecedented in the eight years of the War of Resistance" (according to Marshal Zhao Gongwu, as reported by Yishibao) against the Northeast comrades and the Democratic Allied Forces, carrying out large-scale massacres!
    The fascist reactionaries within the Kuomintang are stubbornly pursuing their own course, waging civil war against the people of Northeast China, attempting to return the people of Northeast China to a dark and hopeless life, thereby undermining national peace and maintaining a dictatorial autocracy. This is a well-known fact. The reactionaries have repeatedly stated that "Northeast China is not within the scope of the truce agreement." They tore up the Northeast truce agreement, obstructed the work of the Executive Headquarters, rejected General Marshall's and the Democratic League's proposals for a ceasefire in Northeast China, and even went so far as to collude with and re-employ the remnants of the enemy and puppet forces, launching a frenzied attack on the people of Northeast China. The responsibility for the expansion of the civil war in Northeast China lies, of course, primarily with the Chinese reactionaries. However, it must be pointed out that the reactionaries still dare to continue expanding their offensive despite the strong resistance of the people of Northeast China. This cannot but be attributed to the assistance they receive from the United States. From the beginning of the civil war in Northeast China until now, the US has never stopped helping the reactionaries, not only airlifting and shipping troops to Northeast China for them, not only guarding railways and ports for them, but also continuously supplying all kinds of weapons manufactured with the blood and sweat of the American people to slaughter the peaceful residents of Northeast China! The reactionaries' bloody hands reaching into Siping Street are possible only because they receive unlimited assistance from the United States.
    However, we want to warn the reactionaries: the strength of the people of Northeast China and the Chinese people has become unprecedentedly powerful! Your policy of civil war and dictatorship, no matter how much support it receives from foreigners, will ultimately be crushed!
    The people of Northeast China and the Democratic Allied Forces will continue their efforts, carry forward the spirit of the Battle of Siping Street, inflict greater blows on the invaders, resolutely defend themselves for peace and democracy, and will not stop until they achieve their goals!
    The self-defense battle of the people of Northeast China is an important part of the national people’s cause for peace and democracy. We call on comrades throughout the country to rise up and stop the reactionaries’ crimes of civil war! We also call on the American people to demand that the US government immediately stop its aid to the Kuomintang government!

　　光荣的四平街保卫战
    解放日报二十一日社论
    在给进犯者以重大打击和杀伤以后，四平街民主联军已于二十日有计划地转移阵地。
    英勇的四平街保卫者，光荣地完成了自己的任务，在三十几天的血战中，不管对方所使用的美制飞机、大炮、火箭炮、坦克的轰击火力怎样猛烈，四平街的保卫者，表现了钢铁一般的意志，使进犯者遭受万人的损失，使国民党士兵开始发生厌战情绪，使反动派遭受应有的打击和教训！国民党反动派曾限令四月二日以前攻下四平街，他们迷信外国武器万能，轻视东北人民的力量，以为民主联军不堪一击，他们满拟一鼓而下四平街，他们的通讯社——中央社曾两次散布占领四平街的谣言（四月十五日和十八日），何应钦并于五月九日亲口宣布国民党军已到达公主岭以南，但是持续到一个月以上的四平街保卫战，打得反动派头破血流，粉碎了他们迅速占领四平街的计划与神话！四平街保卫战光辉地表现了东北人民争取和平民主的伟大自卫力量，这一保卫战对于全中国的和平民主事业，作了极其重大的供献，它将永载于中国人民的解放史上！
    中国人民歌颂着四平街保卫者的英勇业迹，同时也咒骂着反动派的卑鄙无耻！反动派遵行不抵抗主义断送了东北，他们从美国方面得到的飞机坦克以及一切武器装备，在日寇横行中国的时间，从来没有认真拿出来一用，但是，当东北同胞已从日寇铁蹄下解放出来开始建立和平民主生活的时候，反动派却向东北同胞以及民主联军开展了“八年抗战中未有的猛烈战斗”（益世报载赵公武军长的话），进行了大规模的屠杀！
    国民党内法西斯反动派一意孤行，向东北人民进行内战，妄图使东北人民回复暗无天日的生活，从而破坏全国和平，维持独裁专政，这是尽人皆知的事实。反动派一再声言“东北不在停战协定范围以内”，他们撕毁了东北停战协议，阻挠了执行小组的工作，拒绝了马歇尔将军与民主同盟的东北停战建议，甚至不惜勾结重用敌伪残余势力，疯狂的向东北人民猛攻，东北内战扩大的责任，当然是首先在中国反动派的身上，但是，必须指出，在东北人民坚强抵抗之前，反动派仍敢继续扩大进攻，这不能不说是由于美国方面对他的帮助。东北内战自开始一直到现在，美方对反动派的帮助，一向没有停过，不仅替他空运海运部队到东北去，不仅替他看守铁路港口，而且源源不绝地把美国人民血汗制造的各色各样武器，供给来屠杀和平的东北居民！反动派血手伸入四平街之成为可能，仅仅是由于它获得美国方面的无限的帮助。
    但是，我们要警告反动派：东北人民和中国人民的力量已空前的强大了，你们的内战独裁政策，不管外国人给予多少支持，终究是要粉碎的！
    东北人民和民主联军必将再接再厉，发扬四平街保卫战的精神，给进犯者以更大的打击，为和平民主坚决自卫，不达目的誓不中止！
    东北人民的自卫战斗，是全国人民和平民主事业的重要部分，我们号召全国同胞起来，制止反动派的内战罪行！我们并号召美国人民要求美国政府，立即停止对国民党政府的援助！
