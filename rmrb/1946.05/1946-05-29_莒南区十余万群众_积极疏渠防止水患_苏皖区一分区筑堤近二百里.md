　　Over Ten Thousand People in Junan District
    Actively Dredge Canals to Prevent Floods
    First Sub-district of the Suwan District Builds Nearly Two Hundred Li of Dikes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 24th] More than 100,000 people from four or five hundred villages in Donghai, Xinhai, Zhuting, Linshu, and other counties in southern Shandong's Junan District are actively dredging canals to prevent floods. Villages in the Dadian District of Junan have jointly opened canals, completing six canals with a total length of 920 *zhang*. In the future, 4,000 *mu* of surrounding waterlogged land can be turned into fertile fields. Eighteen villages on the west bank of the Shu River in Linshu County suffered flooding on more than 25,000 *mu* of farmland last year. This spring, more than 2,000 people formed a ditch-digging brigade and completed a large 350 *zhang* long river embankment in two days. Except for Zhuting County, the work is now complete. This summer, 515,500 *mu* can be spared from flooding. If calculated at a minimum increase of 50 *jin* per *mu*, a total of more than 25.7 million *jin* of grain can be increased.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, 25th] From last winter to the end of April this year, the Commissioner's Office of the First Sub-district of the Suwan Border Region and the county governments have built 190 *li* of river dikes, including six counties: Haimen, Qidong, Taipei, Jingjiang, Rugao, and Zishi. According to statistics from only three counties, Qidong, Taipei, and Jingjiang, 227,000 *mu* of farmland can be irrigated, and the government has successively allocated 14,500 *dan* of grain as construction funds. Due to enemy and puppet destruction during the eight-year War of Resistance, seawater backflowed in the northeastern part of Nantong, fresh water turned alkaline, and Muxiang and other places in the northern parts of Qidong and Taipei were jointly irrigated. Rugao suffered because the enemy and puppets filled the river beside the road when building the Dingnian to Paigang Highway, making it impossible for farmers on both sides to irrigate, and harvests in various places were poor.

　　莒南区十余万群众
    积极疏渠防止水患
    苏皖区一分区筑堤近二百里
    【新华社临沂二十四日电】山东南部莒南区东海、新海、竹庭、临沭等县四五百村庄十余万群众，积极疏渠，防止水患。莒南大店区各村，联合开渠，已完成六道渠，全长九百二十丈。今后周围四千亩水地，可成良田。临沭县沭河西岸十八个村庄，去年即淹田二万五千余亩。今春二千余群众，组成打堑大队，两天竟完成三百五十丈长之大河堤一道。现除竹庭县外，均已完工。今夏五十一万五千余亩，可免水灾。若按每亩至少增五十斤计，共可增加粮食二千五百七十余万斤。
    【新华社如皋二十五日电】苏皖边区一分区专署及各县府，于去冬起至今年四月底，修筑河堤一百九十里，包括海门、启东、台北、靖江、如皋、紫石等六县。仅据启东、台北、靖江三个县的统计，即有二十二万七千亩农田得以灌溉，政府已先后拨粮一万四千五百担，作修筑经费。按该分区八年抗战中受敌伪破坏后海水倒滥，南通东北部，淡水变碱，并伙灌启东，台北部牧港等地，多年失修，如皋因敌伪修筑丁埝至排港公路时，将路旁河流填塞，两岸农家，无法灌溉，各地收成均歉。
