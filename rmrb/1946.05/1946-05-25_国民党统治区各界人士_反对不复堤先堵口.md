　　【Heze News from Our Newspaper】 The Kuomintang authorities' plan to close the breach without repairing the dike, plotting to flood the people downstream of the old course within two months, is similarly opposed by people from all walks of life in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Henan. Ma Jie, Director of the Henan Office of the Executive Headquarters, stated when hosting reporters in Shanghai regarding the dike repair issue: "The riverbed downstream of the old course is dry, and the dikes on both banks are in disrepair. They must be repaired before the breach is closed, otherwise the upstream closure will lead to downstream flooding." He also stated: "Another problem with repairing the Yellow River is the CCP problem. The old course of the Yellow River, 600 kilometers below Kaocheng, is in the CCP area. There are already 2,000 villages in the old riverbed, with a population of 400,000 (Editor's note: actually 600,000). Once the course is restored, their livelihoods will be precarious." Furthermore, Comrade Liu Xiuqing and others, our representatives who returned to Heze from Bianqian (汴返) the other day, were traveling by car through Mafang, the station of the 74th Division of the Kuomintang army in Kaocheng, when Platoon Leader Wang of the division also stated: "Closing the breach before repairing the old river dikes will drown the common people downstream. I am from Shandong, that won't do." Another company commander stated: "We should not close the breach before repairing the dike, and we cannot create an even larger flooded area."

    反对不复堤先堵口
    【本报荷泽讯】国民党当局堵口而不复堤，阴谋淹毁故道下游人民之两月内堵口计划，同样为河南国民党统治区内各界人士所反对。行总河南公署署长马杰在上海招待记者时对复堤问题称：“故道下游河床干涸，两岸河堤失修，必须于堵口前修复，否则上游堵口，下游泛滥。”又称：“修复黄河之另一问题为中共问题，黄河故道在考城以下六百余公里处，为中共地区，旧河床中村落已达二千，居民四十万（编者按：实际为六十万），一旦复道，生活堪虞”。又前日由汴返荷泽之我方代表刘秀青同志等，乘车经考城国民党军七十四师驻地马房时，该师王排长亦称：“不修旧道河堤，就先堵口，下游老百姓都将淹死，我是山东人，那还了得。”另一连长称：“不应先堵口不复堤，不能再造成一个更大的泛区”。
