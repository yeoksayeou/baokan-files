　　Jinnan Bank Handan City Business Regulations
    (A) Deposits
    1. Fixed Deposits
    I. Interest (calculated as simple interest) and terms are divided into four types:
    For terms of three months or more, the interest rate (monthly interest) is 2.5%.
    For terms of six months or more, the interest rate (monthly interest) is 3%.
    For terms of nine months or more, the interest rate (monthly interest) is 3.5%.
    For terms of one year or more, the interest rate (monthly interest) is 4%.
    II. To benefit depositors, the interest rate will increase during the extended term for those who extend their deposits upon maturity. (For example, if the original term was six months and is extended for three months, the interest rate for those three months will be calculated according to the nine-month rate of 3.5%, and so on.)
    III. Deposits and withdrawals are based on the bank's deposit slips. (If a deposit slip is lost, it can be handled according to the bank's procedure for reporting losses and obtaining replacements.)
    IV. If a depositor urgently needs funds and the deposit has not yet matured, the deposit slip can be used as collateral to obtain a loan from the bank. However, the loan amount shall not exceed 80% of the original deposit amount, and the term shall not exceed the maturity date of the deposit.
    2. Current Deposits. I. General depositors deposit and withdraw using a passbook. II. Those with frequent transactions deposit and withdraw using checks and passbooks. III. No interest is paid for accounts closed within five days. IV. Each deposit must be at least 500 yuan. V. The deposit interest is calculated at a daily rate of 0.5%. VI. Those who have entered into an overdraft agreement may overdraw; the maximum overdraft amount shall not exceed the original deposit amount, and interest shall be calculated based on industrial and commercial lending rates. (Those with frequent transactions will be discussed separately.)
    3. Savings Deposits
    I. The minimum deposit is 100 yuan, and there is no limit to the maximum. (Lump-sum withdrawal from regular savings)
    II. Deposits must be made once a month without interruption. If deposits are skipped for two months, the account will be transferred to a current deposit account.
    III. Deposits made before the 5th of each month will accrue interest from that month; deposits made after the 5th will accrue interest from the following month.
    IV. This type of deposit is divided into two types: six months and one year. For a term of one year, the monthly interest rate is 5%, and for a term of six months, the monthly interest rate is 4.5%, calculated as compound interest; paid in full upon maturity.
    V. If a depositor is transferred for official duties or has a wedding or funeral, interest can be withdrawn at any time based on the current deposit rate, upon providing proof.
    (B) Loans
    1. Industrial and Commercial Loans
    Regardless of the form of credit guarantee or collateral, all borrowers must sign a contract. The procedures are as follows:
    I. Fixed-term loans: The maximum term shall not exceed six months, and the interest rate shall be calculated at a monthly rate of 2% to 7%. To benefit customers, it is specifically stipulated that interest will be reduced for those who return the loan before the maturity date; interest will be calculated for one month if the loan is repaid before one month, and for two months if the loan is repaid before two months.
    II. Current loans: To appropriately regulate finance and take care of the interests of more people, this type of loan will have an approximate repayment period agreed upon in advance before the loan is issued. Within this period, customers can repay freely, and interest will be calculated daily at a daily rate of 0.1% to 0.3%.
    The interest rates for the above two types of loans will be adjusted according to the profit margin of the customer's business.
    2. Small Loans (i.e., Loans for Poor Urban Residents)
    (1) Monthly interest rate of 1% to 1.5%.
    (2) Introduced and guaranteed by mass organizations (such as the National Salvation Association, trade unions, federations, and citizen representative conferences).
    (3) The loan amount per household ranges from 1,000 yuan to a maximum of 10,000 yuan.
    (C) Remittances
    I. The remittance network covers 26 locations throughout the border region; the place names will be announced separately.
    II. Types: Divided into draft remittance and telegraphic remittance.
    III. Remittance amount: Each remittance must be at least 1,000 yuan and no more than 200,000 yuan. For amounts exceeding 200,000 yuan, remittances can be made in installments.
    IV. Handling fee: To benefit customers, no remittance fee will be charged for any remittance; only a handling fee of 0.5% to 1% will be charged.
    V. Reporting loss: To protect remitters from unexpected losses, if a customer accidentally loses a remittance draft or experiences other changes (water damage, fire damage, etc.) and is unable to withdraw funds, they can request a "non-payment certificate" from the deposit bank (if lost, it must be declared invalid in the newspaper) and then apply for a new draft at the original remitting bank. However, the bank will not be responsible if the remittance has already been claimed by someone else.
    (D) Industrial and Commercial Investment (Discussed and handled on a temporary basis through contracts)
    (E) Exchange: Accepting the exchange of raw gold and silver and other currency instruments:
    I. Exchange rates will be posted and priced at any time.
    II. The currency or instruments to be exchanged must be handled through the government or the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. The exchange of gold and silver requires government approval before it can be processed.
    III. The bank charges a certain handling fee for the exchange. (The percentage is determined and announced at any time)
    2. Exchange of Damaged Currency:
    I. The bank entrusts merchants in the city to set up exchange offices in the First Market and Second Market.
    II. The bank's outlets do not handle exchanges.
    Note: Rural lending business will be regulated separately.

    （乙）放款
    １、工商业放款

    二、活期放款：本行为适当的调剂金融，照顾更多人的利益起见，此项放款在放出之前，预先约定大概还款期，在此期限内，顾客可自由偿还，利率按日计算，日息一厘至三厘。
    以上两种放款之利息，大小规定均以顾客所营业务利润厚薄而伸缩之。
