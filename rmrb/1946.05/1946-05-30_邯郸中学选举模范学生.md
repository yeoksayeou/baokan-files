　　【This Municipality News】Handan Middle School held a meeting on May 25th to elect various model students, in order to give play to their leading role in learning, production, and work throughout the school. After two weeks of deliberation, all students in the school had a relatively clear understanding. First, model students in learning were elected, with Zhao Qingquan, Jia Xueqian, and Jiang Risheng being selected. Zhao Qingquan's main achievement was that he initiated the organization of a "reading group." A group of people often followed him, studying books and newspapers or discussing current affairs. Eventually, the reading group expanded to more than eighty people, forming a school-wide reading movement. Next, model students in production were elected, with Guo Yunshan, Jia Xueqian, and Guo Changxing being selected. Guo Yunshan's characteristic is his particular enthusiasm for production. Once, he was hit in the head by a well winch while watering, but he went to work the next day. He is often able to unite many students to work. Jia Xueqian can help students in both learning and production and has a strong spirit of friendship. Students are willing to be close to him. Finally, model students in service were elected, with Ji Derun, Yue Qifeng, and Zhao Qingquan being selected. Ji Derun serves everyone diligently and without complaint and is supported by the majority of students.

　　邯郸中学选举模范学生
    【本市讯】邯郸中学于五月二十五日开会，选举各种模范学员，发挥他们在全校学习生产和工作上的带头作用。经过两周酝酿，全校同学都有了较清楚的认识，首先是选举学习模范，赵清泉、贾学谦、降日升三人当选，赵清泉的主要成绩是他发起组织“读书组”，周围经常有一群人跟着他，研究书报或讨论时事，最后读书组发展到八十多人，形成了全校性的读书运动。接着选举生产模范，郭蕴珊、贾学谦、郭长兴当选，郭蕴山的特点是对生产特别热心，有一次浇水被辘轳打破头，第二天还去干，他时常能团结许多同学去劳动。贾学谦不论在学习上、生产上，都能帮助同学，友爱精神强，同学们都愿意亲近他。最后选举服务模范冀，德润、岳岐峰、赵清泉当选，冀德润为大家服务任劳任怨，被大多数同学所拥护。
