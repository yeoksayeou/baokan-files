　　The Kuomintang Army is Cunning and Shameless
    Secretly Conscripting Japanese Prisoners of War to Massacre Compatriots
    [Xinhua News Agency, Siping Street, 14th] The Kuomintang army is conscripting large numbers of Japanese prisoners of war. From documents seized from the Democratic Allied Army, a despicable telegram from the Kuomintang army regarding the conscription of Japanese prisoners of war was discovered. The original text is as follows: Army 87th Division Headquarters Telegram No. 989, April 15th, 35th year of the Republic of China, to the 21st Regiment: Regarding the case of conscripting Japanese officers and soldiers, we have received orders that it can only be handled under the guise of conscripting enemy prisoners for labor service. Details were previously relayed in the December 17th telegram. This division is conscripting 126 enemy prisoners this time, which cannot be added to this division's roster. A sample format for the designated roster is attached with this telegram. You are to quickly create five copies for submission for record-keeping and to request provisions. Please comply accordingly, in addition to sending separate telegrams. Signed, Division Commander Huang Yan, Deputy Division Commander Peng Quefang. Attached is a sample format for the conscripted enemy prisoner roster.
    From this, it can be seen that the Kuomintang army is expending a great deal of effort in conscripting Japanese prisoners of war as tools for its civil war to massacre compatriots. The Central News Agency's rumors and slanders against the Democratic Allied Army's conscription of Japanese are aimed at diverting attention, but the result is self-exposure.

　　国民党军狡黠无耻
    密征日俘残杀同胞
    【新华社四平街十四日电】国民党军征用大批日俘，从民主联军所缴获之文件中，发现有国民党军对征用日俘之可耻的代电，原文如下：陆军第八十七师司令部代电第九八九号，民国三十五年四月十五日，二十一团鉴：查征用日军官兵一案，曾奉上命，只能以征用敌俘服劳役名义办理，详情业于十二月十七日代电转知在案。本师此次征用敌俘一二六名，当不能补入本师花名册内，兹将制定名册格式一份，随电附发，仰即速造五份，以便转请备案，请领粮饷，除分电外，特电遵照办理。师长黄炎、副师长彭却房有电。附征用敌俘花名册格式一份。
    于此可见，国民党军征用日俘作为其内战工具残杀同胞，真是煞费苦心，而中央社对民主联军征用日人之造谣污蔑，其目的在于转移视听，但结果是自露丑相。
