　　Tense Situation in the Ji-Lu-Yu Region
    Kuomintang Army Eager to Launch a Large-Scale Offensive
    Kuomintang Supports and Connives with Dongming Puppet Troops to Leave the City and Burn, Kill, and Harass; 500,000 People Demand Our Army's Leadership to Strike at the Puppet Troops' Offensive
    [Our Newspaper Heze 23rd Urgent Telegram] The Kuomintang 55th Army, coordinating with the Kuomintang army's invasion of Xiao County and Xiayi, is fiercely attacking northward. Their offensive deployment towards our Ji-Lu-Yu region is basically complete, and the opportunity for battle is imminent. The 29th Division of this army, combined with the puppet troops of Zhi Yongde, Chen Boyang, and others, has Cao County as its target; the main force of the 181st Division has Dingtao as its target, and the 74th Division has Heze as its target. Currently, the Kuomintang garrison in Kaocheng is busy preparing for battle; the 29th Division has already assembled in Zhuji (north of Shangqiu). Based on this situation, the Kuomintang's large-scale offensive is about to begin. The situation in our Ji-Lu-Yu region is extremely tense.
    [Our Newspaper Heze 24th Telegram] The Kuomintang army around the border area does not abide by the truce agreement, destroys the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and attempts to provoke a full-scale civil war, repeatedly combining with puppet troops to attack the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas. According to incomplete statistics, since the issuance of the ceasefire order to today, within 130 days, they have attacked us as many as 110 times (the encirclement and suppression of our Henan East troops is not yet included in the statistics), using 640,000 troops, occupying more than 30 villages and towns in our Fourth Military Sub-district, such as Qingzhongji, Jingshitun, Dingluan, Nanzhen, Wei Yuan, and Changgang, Yuzhen, Huanggang, Huzhuang, and Foji in eastern Henan. The puppet troops of Du Shu in Dongming City, after receiving support and connivance from the Kuomintang, have become even more lawless, leaving the city to burn and kill our peaceful villagers, attacking our area as many as 40 times in two days. Now the people of the entire Ji-Lu-Yu region are unanimously mobilized to resolutely defend themselves. 500,000 people in Dongming, Nanhua, Changyuan, and Dongyuan are gathering everywhere to denounce the crimes of the puppet troops of Du Shu, demanding that our army lead the people to strike at the shameless offensive of these puppet troops.
    [Heze 22nd Telegram] The Kuomintang 12th Army stationed in Changqing and the puppet Zhang Xianting's troops in the city, who were appointed as the county security team by the Kuomintang, continue to attack and plunder our area. On the 8th, this unit, totaling more than a thousand, built bunkers in Zhao Zhuang and Yuhuang Zhuang. On the 9th, more than 80 puppet Zhang Xianting's troops plundered villages in our Fourth Military Sub-district and forcibly collected taxes. On the morning of the 13th, more than 200 of these puppets attacked Sanzhuang (ten li south of the city), the garrison of the First Regiment of our First Military Sub-district, and were repelled by us. On the 15th, they even used six companies to attack our garrison in Pingfang (seventeen li south of the city). They were blocked by us on the same day and retreated to the vicinity of Sanzhuang, Chenzhuang, and Xinzhuang. These puppets actually built strongholds in the above villages, and we were forced to defend ourselves and drove them back on the 16th. We captured seven light machine guns, one small cannon, and killed or captured 136 puppet soldiers. On the 19th, more than 700 Kuomintang troops of an unknown number were added to the city from Jinan.
