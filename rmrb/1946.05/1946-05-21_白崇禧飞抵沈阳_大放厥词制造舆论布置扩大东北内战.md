When answering questions from Central News Agency reporters about the Northeast issue, he blamed the CCP for "not complying with the ceasefire agreement, attacking the National Army, and preventing takeover." He also said that "the Northeast Communist Army is using public opinion, such as the Democratic Allied Army, to prevent the National Army from taking over sovereignty," etc. This is to carry out public opinion mobilization for the Northeast civil war.

    大放厥词制造舆论布置扩大东北内战
    【新华社延安十八日电】北平讯：白崇禧于昨日下午四时半由平飞抵沈阳与熊式辉、杜聿明等晤谈。并于答复中央社记者所询东北问题时，反噬中共“不遵守停战协定，攻击国军，阻止接防。”又说什么“东北共军借民主联军等民意，阻止国军接收主权”云云。为东北内战进行舆论动员。白氏此次抵沈，系布置对东北的新的全面进攻。
