　　Yan Xishan Forcibly Collects Grain
    Taiyuan Citizens Rise in Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 18th] Yan Xishan's military grain preparation committee forcibly requisitioned 30,000 shi of military grain from residents and grain merchants in Taiyuan City. Each business was forced to provide one to five shi, and each household was forced to provide three to more than ten shi. Wealthy households were even forced to provide hundreds of shi. This was called "purchasing grain," but in reality, the price paid was only 280 yuan per shi. Citizens protested against this kind of arbitrary taxation, but to no avail. Wang Jing, Guo Zigang, Wang Ruqiu, Liu Qinghai, Cao Bao San, Zhang Weiqin and more than fifty others were illegally arrested.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 19th] Since the beginning of March, after Li Yizhi's troops of the 55th Army and 74th Division of the Kuomintang moved south from Longhai to southwestern Kaocheng, in addition to constant looting, the rampant extortion in the past two months has made the local people unable to survive. Weizhuang in the third district of the county bears a burden equivalent to 70 jin of grain per mu of land. Ximahui Village in the first district, with only 60 households, was extorted 3,700 jin of grain in one instance. After the large and small trees in the villages were cut down, half of the folk tables, benches, and dowries have been requisitioned for burning. It is even more common for Baozhang (village heads) to be brutally beaten for failing to pay in full. The village head of Xiaosongji, Kong Xiangyan, had his head broken four times in five days. Local people say, "When the Central Army comes, it sweeps everything away, even worse than the devils." Due to the excessive burden and inability to live in peace, the people of this area have fled to the liberated areas one after another.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] Under the extreme famine and epidemic in Jiangxi, the Kuomintang authorities continue to "purchase" 500,000 shi of surplus grain, and limit the collection to Jiujiang within three months.

　　阎锡山强征民粮
    太原市民纷起抗议
    【新华社兴县十八日电】阎锡山之军粮筹备委员会，向太原市住户、粮商强征军粮三万石，商号每户强派一石至五石，住户强派三石至十余石不等，富户有强征至百石者，名为“购粮”，实则每石只给价二百八十元，市民对此种横征暴敛，纷起抗议无效，王景、郭子岗、王瑞秋、刘清海、曹宝三、张维琴等五十余人，反遭到非法逮捕。
    【新华社荷泽十九日电】自三月上旬，国民党五十五军七十四师李益智部自陇海南进至西南考城后，除不断抢掠外，至今两个月内，横征暴敛已使当地民不聊生。该县三区帏庄对该部负担，每亩地合粮七十斤。一区仅六十户人家之西马回村，一次即被勒索粮食三千七百斤，各村大小树木被砍完后，民间桌凳嫁妆已被征烧一半。保长因不能如数缴纳而遭毒打者，更是常事。小宋集保长孔祥郾五天被打破头四次，当地民众说：“中央军来了一扫光，比鬼子还厉害”。因负担过重，不能安生，该地民众纷纷逃来解放区。
    【新华社延安十八日电】国民党当局在江西之极度粮荒与疾病流行下，继续“征购”余粮五十万石，并限三月集中九江。
