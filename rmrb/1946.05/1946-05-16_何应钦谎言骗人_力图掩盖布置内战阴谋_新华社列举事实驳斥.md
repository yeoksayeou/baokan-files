　　He Yingqin's Lies Deceive People
    Trying to Cover Up Conspiracy to Arrange Civil War
    Xinhua News Agency Lists Facts to Refute
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Xinhua News Agency reporter refutes He Yingqin's remarks, stating: He Yingqin's remarks at a press conference in Nanjing on the 9th fabricate facts, speak nonsense, and attempt to cover up the conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas, and to slander the Communist troops who faithfully implemented the ceasefire agreement, in order to create an excuse for their re-launching of a full-scale civil war. In order to expose this civil war expert's deceptive lies, we hereby refute them based on the facts as follows:

    (1) He Yingqin's so-called "sneak attack on Nantong" by the Communist army is entirely a shameless slander. The county towns of Wuwei, Liuhe, Jingjiang, Haimen, Taixing, etc. on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the towns of Xingren, Guanyinshan, Xiaohai, Changle, Batoumen, Liuqi, etc. near Nantong, were all liberated by the New Fourth Army from the hands of the Japanese invaders in August and September of last year. Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale offensive against the Central China liberated areas, and took advantage of the enemy to occupy Haimen on September 10th, occupy Wuwei on the 26th, occupy Taixing on December 31st, and then seize Jingjiang on January 2nd of this year, and recapture Liuhe on the 9th. After the ceasefire order was announced, the reactionaries went back on their word and continued their offensive actions, especially their attacks along the Yangtze River were the most active. In the Liuhe, Jiangdu, Taizhou, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong areas alone, forty-three towns were occupied—the six towns of Xingren, Changle, etc., were forcibly occupied by the Kuomintang 49th Army's 105th Division's 314th Regiment and 315th Regiment, as well as Zhu Tingzhi's puppet Nantong security team, and Zhao Fuxiang's puppet Haimen security team, on April 16th. Under the demand of the local people, the New Fourth Army had no choice but to rise up in self-defense, giving the invading army the punishment it deserved, and on the 26th, it recovered the above-mentioned six towns. More than five hundred Kuomintang soldiers were sacrificed in vain, and more than six hundred surrendered their weapons. Now, the army commander, Wang Tiehan, has personally led a large army to Nantong, and eight warships have been continuously transporting military supplies and troops to Xieqiao in Jingjiang and Tianshenggang on the Yangtze River coast. Recently, the New Fourth Army captured a Kuomintang military scout, Chen Yulian, in the Qihai area of ​​Central Jiangsu. According to his confession: the Kuomintang has decided to use the 21st Army as the main force, and use the four brigades of Zhang Bangsu (alias Zhang Aliu), a famous puppet bandit in Pudong in the past, to jointly attack Qidong. The 88th Army's New 21st Division and 62nd Division suddenly occupied the county seat of Xiao County on April 27th, which is also one of the major offensive actions.

    He Yingqin also fabricated a "log" of the reorganization and movement of the "Eighth Column of the Central China Field Army of the Communist Party." This absurd fabrication is precisely to cover up the fact that the reactionaries violated the agreement and secretly transported troops to the northern Jiangsu area. On the north bank of the Yangtze River, from Nanjing to the mouth of the Yangtze River, a 300-kilometer line, the Kuomintang has five armies stationed. Except for the 74th and 25th Armies which arrived in the Nanjing and Jiangdu areas before the ceasefire, the remaining 49th, 100th, and 21st Armies were all secretly transported here after the ceasefire order. Currently, the Kuomintang army surrounding the area east of the Jinpu Railway, south of the Longhai Railway, and north of the Yangtze River, has fourteen armies, forty-one divisions, and five hundred thousand troops. He Yingqin still thinks this is not enough, and shouts that "there are too few National Army troops stationed," which is a self-admission that he wants to gather more troops to carry out a larger-scale encirclement and suppression.

    Regarding the Central Plains conflict, He Yingqin has exhausted his ability to fabricate rumors and distortions. He said: "There is no conflict in the Central Plains at all," "The Communist army saw that the National Army in the east was empty, so it expanded greatly eastward from its original station, as if it wanted to flee to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway." He also falsely accused our army of "being located south of Guangshan at the time of the ceasefire, and after the ceasefire order, moving to Popihe, Huwan, Dingyuandian, Xuanhuadian, Qingxingdian, and Shigangdian," and "recently expanding its territory eastward." Everyone knows that in last year's Double Tenth Agreement, the Communist Party expressed its intention to withdraw the Central Plains Military Region troops to the liberated area north of the Longhai Railway, but Hu Zongnan immediately strictly blockaded the Yellow River coast with a large army, and divided seven "suppression zones" and launched a large-scale offensive. Our army was forced to withdraw south, and the Kuomintang army continued to pursue and surround, attempting to annihilate our Central Plains troops in the Dahongshan and Siwangshan areas. Until the ceasefire order on January 10, the main force of the Central Plains troops began to transfer to Xixian (December 28), Guangshan (January 6), and the Daxiaowushan area east of the Pinghan Railway. After the ceasefire order was issued, the Kuomintang reactionaries intensified their offensive against us, occupied Xixian on the 11th and Guangshan on the 14th. Our main force was forced to transfer to areas such as Xuanhuadian and Dingyuandian (these locations were originally stationed by our army). Up to now, the Yuxi and Yunan liberated areas, our army has been forced to completely withdraw, and most of the bases in Dahongshan, Siwangshan, Honghu, etc. have been lost. Our Central Plains main force is surrounded in the narrow area around Xuanhuadian. This is the truth about the Central Plains troops "greatly developing eastward" and "expanding territory" that He Yingqin said. He Yingqin also clamored that "the National Army in the east is empty." May I ask, the Kuomintang army used eleven armies, twenty-six divisions, and 300,000 troops in the Central Plains to arrange the civil war. Is this called "empty"? Furthermore, the Kuomintang authorities deployed the 47th, 41st, and 72nd Armies, three armies, seven divisions (excluding local troops), and more than 80,000 people on the Luoshan, Guangshan, Gaocheng, Jingfu, Huang'an, and Macheng lines. Recently, the 58th Army near Suxian was also transferred and moved towards Fuyang and Taihe. Is this called "empty"? As for "there is no conflict in the Central Plains at all," it is even more self-deception. From the ceasefire order to the end of April, the Kuomintang army launched 366 offensives against the Central Plains region, using a total force of more than 650,000, occupying 1,201 towns and villages. More than 7,500 of our soldiers were wounded, killed, or captured. Since May, there has been no day without offensives and no day without battles. This has been seen in our daily dispatches, and the facts are all there. How can it be denied! While He Yingqin is desperately denying the conflict, he is also fabricating the nonsense that the Communist army is "expanding its territory eastward" as an excuse to create a civil war, and trying to continue to transfer troops and gradually implement its plan to encircle and annihilate more than 60,000 Communist troops in the Central Plains under the clever rhetoric of "the National Army in the east is empty" and "the National Army has to send troops to guard against all eventualities," which is extremely sinister!

    (3) He Yingqin fantastically fabricated a so-called "number" of Communist troops attacking the National Army and "number" of occupied towns from January 14th to the end of April, and asked his assistant Cao Shizheng to make a "supplementary explanation," listing 24 county towns occupied by the Communist army. The purpose of this supplementary explanation was to make up for the flaw in He Yingqin's speech that he could not provide specific place names, but the result just exposed his master's flaws. Among the 24 cities listed by Cao Shizheng, Boshan and Zichuan were liberated from the enemy and puppet hands by the Shandong Eighth Route Army as early as August 23rd and 25th last year. Later, the Kuomintang authorities instructed the Japanese troops stationed in Shandong, the 43rd Unit, to "recover" these two cities on September 12th and 18th. On December 6th, we recaptured these two cities again; on the 8th, they were occupied by the puppet army reorganized by the Kuomintang. Before the ceasefire order was announced, we recovered them for the third time, and have since maintained them in our hands. Yidu was liberated by our Shandong Eighth Route Army on August 23rd last year, and was "recovered" by the Dragon Book Unit of the 12th Brigade of the Japanese Garrison under the instruction of the Kuomintang on September 9th. On the 15th, it was recovered by us again, and has since maintained it in our hands. Anze was recovered by our army from the enemy as early as May 12th last year. On August 18th, Yan Xishan's troops once peeked into it, but were repelled by us. The situation in Shuangbao, Hunchen, Mengxian, Fushan, Zuoyun, and Yutian is roughly similar. They were all first liberated by our army, then once occupied by the Kuomintang army, and finally recovered by our army. As for the county towns of Yicheng, Anci, Wen'an, Yixian, and Wencheng, they were recovered by our army from the enemy and puppets during the period from May to the end of last year, and no soldier of the Kuomintang army was ever seen. Even more absurd is saying that we occupied Yingkou, Fengrun, Quwo and other cities. It was found that Yingkou was occupied by the Kuomintang 71st Army's 88th Division on April 2nd, and is now occupied by the Kuomintang 60th Army's 184th Division. Fengrun was recovered by our Jidong troops from the enemy and puppets on September 26th last year, and was occupied by the Kuomintang 94th Army's 5th Division on January 12th this year, and is still occupied by the Kuomintang 94th Army's 41st Division. Quwo was originally recovered by the Taiqiu troops of the Eighth Route Army one day before the ceasefire order was announced, and was occupied by Yan's army after the ceasefire order was announced, and is still controlled by Yan Xishan's Pioneer Column. The Central News Agency is still constantly falsely accusing us of besieging Quwo, and now it is said that we occupied it. Isn't this a blatant lie! In short, the cities listed by He were all originally liberated by the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army from the enemy and puppets, and then occupied by the Kuomintang army. Some of them were seized before the ceasefire order took effect, and there are still many cities occupied by them. He's so-called "offensive after the ceasefire meeting" is exactly what he himself is doing. Not only that, according to available materials, from the ceasefire meeting to the end of April, the Kuomintang army launched 3,511 large and small offensives against the liberated areas, using a total force of 2,582,764 people, forcibly occupying 2,077 of our villages and towns. In addition to the aforementioned Yingkou, Fengrun, and Quwo, there are also 16 county towns including Xiao County, Guangshan, Xixian, Pingyuan, Jianchang, Panshan, Taian, Liaozhong, Fushun, Liaoyang, Anshan, Haicheng, Tieling, Kaiyuan, Changtu, and Benxi, killing and wounding more than 33,000 of our officers, soldiers and government cadres. He Yingqin has recently been arranging the civil war everywhere, and after returning to Nanjing, he has repeatedly issued speeches, arbitrarily slandering the Chinese Communist Party, obviously conducting public opinion mobilization for his planned civil war cause. The people of the country should be seriously vigilant.

　　何应钦谎言骗人
    力图掩盖布置内战阴谋
    新华社列举事实驳斥
    【新华社延安十三日电】新华社记者驳斥何应钦谈话称：何应钦九日在南京记者招待会谈话，捏造事实，信口雌黄，力图掩盖国民党反动派正在布置的大规模进攻解放区的阴谋，并诬蔑忠实执行停战协定的中共军队，以为其再次发动全面内战制造借口。为了戳穿这个内战专家的骗人谎言，特据实驳斥如下：
    （１）何应钦所谓中共军“偷袭南通”云云，全系无耻谰言。长江北岸之无为、六合、靖江、海门、泰兴等县城及南通附近之兴仁镇、观音山镇、小海镇、长乐镇、坝头门、六淇等镇，早为新四军于去年八九月间由日寇手中解放，后国民党反动派向华中解放区大举进攻，并利用敌人于九月十日占我海门，二十六日占我无为，十二月三十一日占我泰兴，本年一月二日又夺我靖江，九日复陷我六合。停战令公布后，反动派背信弃义，仍继续其进攻行动，尤其对长江沿岸攻击最为积极，仅六合、江都、泰州、如皋、南通、海门、启东地区，即被侵占四十三个镇——兴仁、长乐等六镇，系国民党四十九军一○五师三一四团与三一五团等部及伪南通保安队朱廷治部、伪海门保安队赵福祥部、于四月十六日强占，新四军在当地人民要求下，不得已起而自卫，予进犯军以应有打击，并于二十六日恢复上述六镇，国民党军无谓牺牲者五百余，六百余人放下武器。现该军军长王铁汉，又亲率大军开抵南通，并有八艘军舰连日运载军火及部队至长江岸靖江之斜桥、天生港之线。日前新四军在苏中启海地区捕获国民党军军事侦察陈玉炼一名，据供：国民党已决定以二十一军为主力，并利用过去浦东的著名伪匪张帮苏（别名张阿六）的四个大队联合进攻启东的计划。而八十八军新二十一师、六十二师于四月二十七日突然攻占我萧县县城，亦即为大举进攻行动之一。
    何应钦又制造了一个《中共华中野战军第八纵队》改编和移动的“日志”，这一妄诞臆造，也正是为了掩盖反动派违约偷运军队至苏北地区的事实。长江北岸由南京至长江口一线三百公里，国民党驻有五个军，除七十四军、二十五军系停战前抵达南京、江都地区外，其余四十九军、一百军、二十一军，均系停战令后偷运前来。目前包围我津浦线以东、陇海线以南、长江以北地区的国民党军，有十四个军、四十一个师五十万之众，而何应钦尤以为未足，大嚷“驻守国军太少”，其欲调集更多军队，实行更大规模围攻，亦是不打自招。
    关于中原冲突问题，何应钦更竭尽其造谣与歪曲之能事，他说：“中原根本无冲突”，“共军见东边国军空虚，乃自原驻地向东大事发展，似欲窜至津浦南段”。并诬我军“于停战时位于光山以南，停战令后移据泼皮河、虎湾、定远店、宣化店、清兴店、湿港店”，“最近向东扩展地盘”。谁都知道，去年双十协定中，中共曾表示撤退中原军区部队至陇海路以北解放区，但胡宗南旋即以大军在黄河沿岸严密封锁，并划分了七个“清剿区”，大举进攻；我军被迫南撤，国民党军又继续追击包围，企图将我中原部队歼灭于大洪山、四望山地区。直至一月十日停战令前，中原区部队主力始转移至平汉路东息县（十二月二十八日）、光山（一月六日）及大小悟山地区。停战令下达后，国民党反动派对我攻势益猛，十一日攻占我息县，十四日攻占我光山，我主力乃被迫转移至宣化店、定远店等地区（这些地点原已为我军驻在）。迄今豫西、豫南解放区，我军已被迫完全撤出，大洪山、四望山、洪湖等根据地大部损失，我中原主力被围于宣化店一带狭仄地区，这就是何应钦所说的中原部队“向东大事发展”、“扩大地盘”的真相。何应钦又叫嚣“东边国军空虚”，试问国民党军在中原使用了十一个军、二十六个师、三十万大军布置内战，这叫做“空虚”吗？再说，国民党当局以四十七军、四十一军、七十二军三个军七个师（地方部队未计在内）八万余人，布置在罗山、光山、高城、经扶、黄安、麻城一线，最近又抽调了宿县附近的五十八军，向阜阳、太和移动，这叫做“空虚”吗？至于“中原根本无冲突”云云，更是自欺欺人之谈。自停战令至四月底止，国民党军对中原区进攻达三百六十六次，使用兵力达六十五万以上，侵占城镇村庄一千二百零一个，我被击伤、阵亡、被俘七千五百余人。五月份以来，更无日不在进攻，无日不有战事，已见本社逐日电讯，事实俱在，岂容狡赖！何应钦一面拚命否认冲突，同时又胡诌什么共军“向东扩展地盘”的谰言，以作其制造内战借口，并企图在“东边国军空虚”、“国军为防范万一，不得不派军队警戒”等等巧妙辞令掩盖之下，继续调兵遣将，逐步展开其围歼中原六万余中共军队的计划，用心至为险毒！
    （三）何应钦异想天开的捏造了一个所谓自一月十四日至四月底止，共军攻袭国军的“次数”，攻占城镇的“处数”，并要其助手曹士征作了个“补充说明”，列举出共军攻占之县城廿四座。这个补充说明的用意，是在弥补何应钦谈话不能举出具体地名的破绽，但结果恰正暴露了其主人的马脚。曹士征所举廿四城中，博山、淄川早在去年八月二十三、二十五日即为山东八路军从敌伪手中解放，后国民党当局指使日寇驻山东的四三部队，于九月十二日与十八日将此二城代为“收复”，十二月六日，我又将此二城再次夺回；八日又被国民党收编的伪军占去，停战令公布前，我第三次将其收回，此后即始终保持我手。益都于去年八月廿三日为我山东八路军解放，九月九日被国民党指使日寇警备第十二旅团龙本部队代为“收复”，至十五日又为我再度光复，此后即始终保持我手。安泽早于去年五月十二日为我军从敌人手中收复，八月十八日阎锡山部曾一度进窥，被我击退。双宝、浑臣、孟县、浮山、左云、玉田六城，情形大抵类似，均系我首先由我军手中解放，后一度被国民党军侵占，最后仍由我军恢复。至于翼城、安次、文安、易县、文城等县城，则系我军于去年五月至年底以前期间，由敌伪手中光复，从未见国民党军一兵一卒。更荒唐的，是说我占领营口丰润、曲沃等城。查营口于四月二日为国民党七十一军八八师侵占，现由国民党六十军一八四师占驻。丰润为我冀东部队于去年九月二十六日从敌伪手中收复，今年一月十二日为国民党九十四军第五师侵占，至今仍为国民党九十四军四十一师占驻。曲沃本为停战令公布前一日八路军太丘部队收复，停战令公布后被阎军占去，至今仍为阎锡山收复先锋纵队控制，中央社犹不断诬我围困曲沃，今又谓我攻占，岂非白书见鬼！总之，何氏列举这些城市，均系当初八路军、新四军由敌伪手中解放后，为国民党军侵占，其中有的是在停战令生效以前夺取，且至今仍有不少城市霸占在其手中。何氏所谓“停战会后进攻”云云，正是夫子自道。不仅此也，据已有材料，国民党军于停战会后至四月底，向各解放区大小进攻达三五一一次，使用总兵力二、五八二、七六四人，强占我村镇二零七七座，县城除上述营口、丰润、曲沃外，尚有萧县、光山、息县、平原、建昌、盘山、台安、辽中、抚顺、辽阳、鞍山、海城、铁岭、开源、昌图、本溪等十六座，杀伤我官兵及政权干部共三万三千余人。何应钦最近处处布置内战，而在回到南京以后，又一再发表谈话，恣意诬蔑中共，显系为其计划中的内战事业进行舆论动员，国人应予严重警惕。
