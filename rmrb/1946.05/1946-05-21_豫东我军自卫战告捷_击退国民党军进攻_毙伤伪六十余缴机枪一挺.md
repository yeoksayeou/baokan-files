　　Eastern Henan Our Army Achieves Victory in Self-Defense War
    Repelling Kuomintang Army Offensives
    Killing or Wounding Over 60 Puppet Troops, Seizing One Machine Gun
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 17th] The local troops and regular corps of our eastern Henan counties have achieved gradual victories in the self-defense war to smash the "encirclement and suppression" by the Kuomintang army and puppet troops. The 55th Regiment of the puppet Zhang Lanfeng's force, which was cooperating with the Kuomintang army in "encircling and suppressing" our eastern Henan liberated area, invaded Zhuanjiaolou in Suixian County on the night of the 13th. The next night, it continued to attack a certain unit of our Eighth Route Army stationed in Chaozhuang, five miles north of the village. Our army was forced to defend itself and repelled them, killing or wounding over 60 puppet troops and seizing one light machine gun. On the same day, the First Detachment of our Suixian County Brigade recovered He Yangji in the southeast of Sui (county). More than 200 puppet troops of Zhang Xianlian's force in Changqing attacked the station of a certain regiment of ours in Sanzhuang, ten miles south of the city, at 8:00 a.m. on the 13th. They were immediately repelled by our garrison. Another group of them went to Wu Jiapo, fifteen miles southwest of the city, to loot and did not flee back to the city until the afternoon. At the same time, more than 200 puppet troops of Li Lianxiang's force in Qihe went to Ao Jiajing to seize grain and were repelled by our Qihe Independent Battalion, which seized one small cannon.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 17th] A part of the Kuomintang 40th Army, cooperating with two regiments, the 4th and 5th, of the puppet Li Ying's force, totaling more than 2,000 people with seven cannons, launched an attack on the area west of the Nanhe River in the Fourth Military Subdistrict of Hebei-Shandong-Henan (Qixian, Tangyin, Neihuang, Huaxian, etc.) on the 12th. The puppet Li Ying's force has occupied Dougongji and Ma Taibao, more than ten miles northwest of our Chu Wangzhen (belonging to Neihuang County). A part of the 40th Army occupied Lv Cunjie, northwest of our Chu Wangzhen, attempting to pincer attack our Chu Wangzhen. In addition, two battalions and the Second Detachment of the cavalry battalion of Wang Sanzhu's 7th Security Regiment of Fengqiu, totaling more than 1,000 people, invaded Gao Cunjie, Da Xiao Wangzhuang, Qiu Si, Liu Cun, Jinning and other villages east of Zhongshi Tun in Huaxian on the 8th and surrounded our garrison. Our army bravely broke through the encirclement and repelled all the invading forces in the above villages.
