　　Within the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    A Thousand Li of Waterways See Ships Coming and Going
    [Jinji Luyu 9th dispatch] Inland river transportation within the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region is now unobstructed. The waterways currently in operation total over a thousand li. On the river route from Jining to Xiazhen on the east bank of Weishan Lake, which is approximately 400 li long, there are already over two hundred merchant ships constantly plying the waters. Merchant ships from the Grand Canal have gathered here, and large quantities of imports and exports are freely traded. Jining's specialty products such as black dates, sheepskin, and cowhide have found vast markets. At the same time, Jining City is also receiving a large influx of grain. From Daokou, an important town on the Pinghan Railway, to Linqing, a famous town in southern Hebei, there is a 600-li-long Wei River waterway. There are currently over a hundred large ships transporting cotton from Linqing and wheat from Weihe County. Furthermore, the Weihe Industry and Commerce Bureau, in order to develop inland river transportation and encourage the masses to build ships, has already built two large ships, each seven or eight zhang long, which have begun transporting goods and earned a profit of 7 million yuan within ten days.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jining, 18th dispatch] Jining City's transportation construction is increasing daily. There are currently over thirty automobiles. Since merging with the Luxi Xinghua Automobile Company on May 1st, they are now rushing to repair the Ji(ning)-Teng(xian) and Ji-Xu(zhou) lines. The number of passengers on each line is increasing daily. Business revenue in March was 4.5 million yuan, and in April it increased to over 10 million yuan. City buses within the city will begin operating soon.
