　　New-Type Employer-Employee Relationship
Turned-Over and Rising Rich Peasant Cao Shufang Treats Employees Well
    Employees Have High Labor Efficiency, One is Worth Two.
    [From Our Changzhi Correspondent] A new-type of employer-employee relationship is growing in the home of rich peasant Cao Shufang in Caojia Village, She County. Before the war, Cao Shufang was a poor peasant who lacked food and clothing. In the past two or three years, under the rent reduction and interest rate reduction policies of the democratic government, he and many other poor people turned over. In the great production movement, he actively worked and produced, improved his life, bought a mule, rose to become a rich peasant, and was elected village chief of Caojia Village. This year, in order to develop even further, he specifically hired a long-term worker. Because Cao Shufang is a rich peasant who grew up in the new society, he adopted a new attitude towards his long-term worker. He frequently seeks the opinions of his employees, cares about their meals. Whenever there is a fair or opera performance, he gives the employee pocket money and dry food. The employee, Cao Si, is very moved, and his labor efficiency is worth two people. He plans all his work automatically, without the need for the employer to supervise him. Shufang often tells people, "We are all sufferers. We used to hold other people's bowls. Now that we have turned over, we must not forget our brothers." "May Day" Labor Day is the workers' festival. Shufang didn't know this, so he didn't give his long-term worker a holiday. Afterwards, he hurriedly asked his wife to cook a good meal for Si, and gave him a day off to rest at home, while he drove the donkey to the fields. Si felt embarrassed to be idle at home, so he quietly carried his hoe to the fields again. The villagers unanimously praised this united employer-employee relationship, saying, "This is a truly good employer and employee, a good example in the new society!" Currently, Shufang has decided to implement profit-sharing and reward methods with Si to further increase production.

　　新型主雇关系翻身后上升富农曹树芳对待雇工好 
    雇工劳动效率高，一个顶两个。
    【本报长治讯】一种新型的主雇关系，在涉县曹家村富农曹树芳家生长起来了。曹树芳战前是少吃少穿的贫农，两三年来在民主政府减租减息政策下，和许多贫苦群众一块翻了身；在大生产运动中，又积极劳动生产，改善了生活，买了骡子上升为富农，并被选为曹家村村长。今年他为了更加发展，特雇了长工，由于曹树芳是新社会生长起来的富农，他对长工便采取了新的态度。他经常征询雇工意见，关心雇工饭食，每逢赶会瞧唱，都给雇工盘钱、干粮，雇工曹四的十分感动，劳动效率一个顶两个。一切作活都自动计划，不用主家督促。树芳常告人说：“都一样是受苦人，咱过去也端过人家的碗底，现在翻身了，决不能忘掉自己的兄弟。”“五一”劳动节，是工人的节日，树芳不知道，没有放长工假，以后他赶忙让老婆给四的做好饭吃，并补假一天，让他在家休息，自己赶着毛驴上地。四的也不好意思在家闲着，自己又悄悄扛上锄头上地去了。村人对这样团结的主雇关系，都一致赞扬的说：“这才是对好主雇，新社会中的好榜样！”目前树芳并决定与四的实行分红及奖励办法，以更提高生产。
