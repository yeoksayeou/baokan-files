　　[From our Changzhi correspondent] District cadres in LiCheng County held a meeting in mid-May to inspect the production situation since the start of spring plowing, and identified the main reasons for the current sluggishness of the movement. Since the spring plowing mobilization in March this year, the mutual aid teams throughout the county have been reorganized, resolving issues left over from last year such as unequal value exchange and uncleared accounts, and the movement has seen new development. More than ten villages have been able to organize activities based on farmers' own "cultivate three, reserve one" and "cultivate two, reserve one" plans. Cadres have begun to gain a new understanding of the principle of realizing "cultivate three, reserve one." Villages along the Handan-Changzhi Road, through persuasion, mobilization, and specific organization, have gradually overcome the ideology of valuing commerce over agriculture. At the same time, the second and sixth districts, which have little land and poor soil and had no habit of engaging in sideline production in the past, have now begun to pay attention to organizing surplus labor for sideline production. Various villages have created many methods of combining agriculture and sideline production and distributing dividends based on equal value of labor. Based on this foundation, the county launched an unprecedentedly widespread wheat weeding campaign, with 71 percent of wheat fields weeded. Ten days after the rain, the county rushed to plant more than 36,300 mu of cotton, exceeding the original plan by more than 6,000 mu.
    The main reason for the current sluggishness of the movement is that the leadership's understanding of the "cultivate three, reserve one" principle is very unspecific, and therefore the approach is also very superficial. For example, many cadres believe that "universally achieving cultivate three, reserve one" is just a slogan, "that's what they say, but it's not necessarily what they do." They fail to see that "organizing the masses" is the guarantee for realizing "cultivate three, reserve one," and simply emphasize the difficulties of material conditions such as thin soil, lack of by-products, and insufficient manpower. Another is blindly optimistic, only seeing the achievements of some advanced areas and emphasizing: "Some people have already achieved cultivate three, reserve one last year, so this year is no problem." But they don't think of ways to further increase production. Secondly, there is a lack of overall understanding of the principle; either thinking that it is only to support poor peasants, and therefore only helping poor peasants and widows and widowers to make plans, or thinking that it is simply rewarding rich peasants, ignoring the support of poor tenant farmers. In short, the understanding of supporting poor peasants, developing middle peasants, and rewarding rich peasants is incomplete. In the implementation of "cultivate three, reserve one," they often do not proceed from specific circumstances. For example, Zizhen was already able to achieve "cultivate three, reserve one" early on, but they still insisted that the masses make "cultivate three, reserve one" plans. Therefore, the masses reflected: "We can achieve cultivate three, reserve one just by lying down." Some regard the promotion of improved varieties as the only way to increase production, and therefore mechanically promote improved varieties everywhere in mountainous areas. For example, the thin land of Huangcaozhan cannot even grow ordinary crops well, but they insist on promoting Golden Queen, which is opposed by the masses and therefore fails. Finally, the last point is that they do not regard the "cultivate three, reserve one" principle as a process of education and struggle, demanding too much and hoping that even the extremely poor can immediately achieve "cultivate three, reserve one."
    From the above situation inspection, the following practices were determined for the future: First, carry out specific leadership, not only helping the masses to make plans, but also carrying out specific organizational work according to different situations, helping to make plans on a seasonal basis and checking and promoting them at any time. Second, in order to turn the "cultivate three, reserve one" principle into a common idea and principle of the masses of all strata, it is necessary to universally carry out education on increasing production and getting rich, explaining that getting rich through production not only does not involve struggle, but also should be rewarded. Emphasis should be placed on local actual examples, praising and publicizing new-type rich peasants, establishing new banners, and educating the masses to recognize the glory of getting rich through production and the happiness of improving living standards.
    After this inspection, the cadres of the whole county have determined to go deep into reality and implement the re-clarified principles and practices through sowing.

　　黎城检查春耕领导
    具体贯彻“耕三余一” 
    加强组织工作，把生产提高一步。
    【本报长治讯】黎城县区干部，五月中旬召开会议检查了春耕以来的生产情况，找出了当前运动迟滞的主要原因。从今年三月份的春耕动员后，全县的互助组经过了重新整顿，解决了去年遗留下的不等价、没有算清账等问题，运动有了新的开展；有十多个村，已经能依据农户自己的“耕三余一”、“耕二余一”计划组织活动，干部对实现耕三余一的方针，开始有了新的了解。邯长路沿线村庄，经过说服动员和具体组织，重商轻农的思想，已逐渐克服。同时土地少且坏的二、六区，过去没有搞副业习惯，现在也开始注意组织剩余劳动力进行副业生产。各村创造了不少农业副业结合和变工等价分红办法。以此为基础，全县开展了空前普遍的锄麦运动，麦田百分之七十一都锄过，雨后十天，全县突击种棉三万六千三百多亩，超过原定计划六千多亩。
    当前运动迟滞的主要原因是领导上对耕三余一的方针的了解很不具体，因而在作法上也很不深入，如许多干部认为“普遍达到耕三余一”只是一个口号，“叫是这样叫，可不一定这样做。”看不到群众“组织起来”就是实现“耕三余一”的保证，单纯强调土地薄、缺副产、人力不够等物质条件的困难。另一种却是盲目乐观，只看到一些先进地区的成绩就强调：“去年有的就已经做到耕三余一了，今年不成问题。”而不想办法进一步增产。其次是对方针缺乏全盘的认识；或者认为仅是扶植贫农，因而只帮助贫农、鳏寡订计划，或者又认为是单纯奖励富农，忽视扶植贫佃农。总之，对扶植贫农，发展中农，奖励富农的认识不完整。在对“耕三余一”的执行上，也往往不从具体情况出发，如子镇“耕三余一”已早能做到，还硬要群众订“耕三余一”计划，因此群众反映说：“耕三余一咱躺下也能达到了。”有的把推广优良品种当做增产的唯一办法，因而机械的在山地也到处推广优良品种，如黄草沾的薄地连一般庄稼还长不好而硬去推广金皇后，遭群众反对，因而失败。最后一点是没有把“耕三余一”的方针当作一个教育和奋斗的过程，要求过高，对赤贫也希望他立即达到“耕三余一”。
    从以上情况的检查中，确定了今后的作法：第一，是进行具体领导，不单单是帮助群众订计划，而且要按照不同情况进行具体的组织工作，随时帮助按季订计划并检查推动，第二，要把“耕三余一”的方针变成各阶层群众的共同思想与方针，就必须普遍进行增产发家的教育，说明生产致富不仅不斗争，而且还要奖励，应着重以当地实际例子，表扬与宣传新型富农，树立新的旗帜，教育群众，认识生产致富的光荣和生活改善的幸福。
    全县干部经过这一检查，已决心深入实际通过下种，把重新明确了的方针与作法贯彻下去。
