　　[Our Yangcheng News] Since the county-wide 30,000-person Speak Bitterness and Revenge rally in Yicheng on February 11th, the flames of Speak Bitterness and Revenge have been ignited throughout the county. After the breakthrough in the East and West Stone Bridge area of the first district, the struggle quickly spread to seven or eight villages. The Speak Bitterness and Revenge meeting in the second district had a total of 27,000 people in the district, reaching 20,000 participants; the masses from Fushan and Qinshui also traveled long distances to participate. Other districts also universally launched joint struggles, with 120,000 people in the county throwing themselves into the torrent of revenge. They cried, clenched their fists, and shouted: "Repay hatred with hatred, avenge grievances with grievances," "Unite and stand up!" By mid-March, most villages in the third and second districts had completed rent reduction and debt clearance. Villages such as Guanzhuang in the third district began to organize mutual aid teams. According to statistics from nine villages in the second district, 2,434 cases of rent and interest issues were resolved. The first and fourth districts are now deeply engaged in rent reduction and debt clearance. According to statistics from 36 villages, farmers who had lost their land have obtained over 700 mu of irrigated land, over 12,500 mu of dry land, and 6,154 shi of grain in the struggle. After obtaining this land and grain, most of the farmers have risen in status. For example, 178 poor households in Yaodu Village have now risen to the status of middle peasants; 15 tenant households have risen to the status of middle peasants. As the struggle develops, the political awareness of the masses has also increased. During this election of National Assembly representatives, the masses universally reflected: "We must elect our own people to represent our own interests." All the people of Xixiaping Village submitted eight proposals to the National Assembly, the first of which was to demand the universal implementation of rent reduction and interest rate reduction nationwide. In the villages that have been mobilized, farmers have successively established their own organizations, formed peasant associations and militias, and transformed village political power. The reason why the mass movement here can develop so rapidly is, first, because the policy of boldly relaxing control and trusting the wisdom of the masses has been implemented. Secondly, the leaders everywhere support the masses and organize large-scale joint struggles. Thirdly, the forces are concentrated. In addition to more than 100 cadres in the county, there are also more than 50 members of the Taiyue Administrative Office work team. In terms of the forms of struggle, there are the following: (1) Those organized and struggled automatically by the masses, such as Yaodu Village, which was led by the village's active members Zhang Bingyan and Zhang Fengx from beginning to end. (2) Those where work team cadres go to the village to discover active members and collude with the masses to rise up in struggle. (3) In villages where special agent activities are rampant, the work team can't find out anything after arriving in the village. At that time, they suppressed the special agents on one hand, enlightened the masses' struggle emotions; on the other hand, they carefully discovered active members, secretly brewed collusion, and gradually turned to open struggle. (4) In the old liberated areas, rents had been reduced, but it was not thorough in practice, and special agents secretly engaged in activities. The masses carried out rent reduction and debt clearance in the anti-special agent campaign. (5) As for the Hexi area of the fourth district, first concentrate forces on the Xixiaping base point. On the other hand, look for active members in the surrounding villages to participate in the base point struggle and learn from the experience. Then disperse and return to each village to launch the struggle.

　　十二万人齐翻身
    翼城群运迅速普遍
    领导上大胆放手集中力量干广大农民收回土地努力生产
    【本报阳城讯】翼城自二月十一日全县三万人诉苦复仇大会后，便燃起了全县诉苦复仇的火焰。一区东西石桥突破后，斗争很快普遍到七、八个村子。二区的诉苦复仇会，全区共两万七千人，便到了两万人，浮山、沁水的群众，也远道赶来参加。其他各区也普遍展开了联合斗争，全县十二万人，投入了复仇巨浪中，他们流着眼泪，握着拳头，高喊：“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”，“团结起来翻身”。至三月中旬，全县八十四个行政村，发动起来八十个。四月底，三、二区大部村子减租清债已结束，三区关庄等村，开始组织互助大队，据二区九个村统计，解决租息问题二千四百三十四件。一、四区现在深入减租清债，据三十六个村统计，失掉土地的农民，在斗争中取得水地七百余亩，旱地一万二千五百余亩，粮食六千一百五十四石。农民得到这些土地粮食后，大部都上升了，如尧都村一百七十八户贫农，现已上升为中农；十五户佃户，上升为中农。随着斗争开展，群众政治觉悟亦提高了。这次选举国大代表时，群众普遍反映：“要选咱自己人，才能代表自己利益。”西下坪村的全体老百姓，向国大提出八个提案，其中头一款，就是要求全国普遍实行减租减息。已经发动起来的村子，农民纷纷建立起自己的组织，成立农会民兵，改造村政权。这里群运所以能开展的如此迅速，首先是执行了大胆放手的方针，相信群众智慧。其次领导上到处给群众撑腰，组织大规模的联合斗争。再次是力量集中，除本县一百多干部外，尚有太岳行署工作队五十余人。在斗争形式上，有如下几种：（一）是由群众自动组织起来斗争的，如尧都村自始至终是本村积极分子张丙彦、张凤×领导的。（二）是由工作队干部到村中发现积极分子，串通群众起来斗争的。（三）是村中特务活动厉害，工作队到村后啥也问不出，当时一面镇压特务，启发群众斗争情绪；另方面细心发现积极分子，秘密酝酿串通，逐渐转入公开斗争。（四）是老解放区，曾减过租，实际并不彻底，特务暗地活动，群众在反特务中进行减租清债。（五）如四区河西一类，先集中力量在西下坪基点，另方面在周围村寻找积极分子参加基点斗争，学习经验。然后分散回各村去，开展斗争。
