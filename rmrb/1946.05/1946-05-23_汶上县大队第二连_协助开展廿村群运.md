　　The Second Company of the Wenshang County Brigade
    Assists in Carrying Out Mass Movements in Twenty Villages
    [Our Heze Dispatch] All officers and soldiers of the Second Company of the Wenshang County Brigade in the Second Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region participated in the mass movement to help the masses achieve liberation, becoming a model for the army's participation in mass movements. In the course of the Wenshang mass movement, it was constantly sabotaged by secret agents and bandits. The masses demanded the suppression of secret agent activities and assistance in helping them to achieve liberation. The company first cooperated with local cadres to participate in the mass movement in the Second District. Comrade Cheng Guangjin, the political instructor, educated the soldiers and cadres on respecting local cadres and how to mobilize the masses, organizing competitions by platoon and dividing areas. They were very enthusiastic, propagandizing to the masses everywhere, participating in peasant association meetings, and some even helped the masses stand guard during struggles. This month, the company has assisted in carrying out mass movements in twenty villages. Because the army helped the masses achieve liberation, the masses also automatically organized to assist the army's activities, and the relationship between the army and the people became closer. The Wenshang Brigade is now promoting the experience of the Second Company to encourage other companies to participate in the mass movement.

    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫二分区汶上县大队二连全体指战员。参加群运帮助群众翻身，成为军队参加群运的模范。汶上群运开展中，不断遭受特务土匪的破坏，群众要求镇压特务活动，帮助群众翻身，该连首先配合地方干部参加二区群运。指导员程广金同志曾对战士和干部进行尊重地方干部和如何发动群众的教育，以排为单位分组划开地区发起竞赛。他们热情很高，到处向群众宣传，参加农会开会，有的并在斗争时帮助群众站岗，本月内该连已协助开展了二十个村子的群众运动。由于军队帮助了群众翻身，群众也自动组织起来动协助军队活动，军民关系更加密切。汶上大队现正川二连的经验推动其他各连参加群运。
