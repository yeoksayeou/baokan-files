　　Changchun City's Thirty-Five Schools Resume Classes
    Medical University to Open at the End of the Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th] The large-scale Changchun Medical University is currently actively preparing to begin classes. The democratic government has dispatched personnel to the university to assist in the organization and has allocated funds to resolve the living problems of students remaining at the school. The school buildings have already begun to be repaired, and more than ten full-time professors have been hired. The university is notifying students scattered in various locations to return to the school as soon as possible to register. Over 500 students have registered in the past few days, with women accounting for one-third of them. Currently, most of the university's professors have arrived at the school. After holding entrance exams, classes can begin. Among the public and private primary and secondary schools, eleven middle schools and twenty-four primary schools have resumed classes, with a total of 25,370 students, accounting for four-fifths of the city's original student population. The remaining one-fifth of the students will soon arrive from other locations to resume their studies.
