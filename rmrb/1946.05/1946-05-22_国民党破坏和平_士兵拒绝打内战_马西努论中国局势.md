　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th】Moscow Radio commentator Marcinow commented on the Chinese situation, stating: The Kuomintang authorities are unwilling to have peace. On all fronts of the Chinese civil war, they continue to concentrate large numbers of Kuomintang troops. A reporter from the Shanghai United Daily in Beiping learned that on all fronts, the Kuomintang concentrated thirty-five army corps, totaling approximately one million people. At the same time, adding the puppet troops reorganized in various places, there are 450,000 in North China and 350,000 at Shanhaiguan. The Kuomintang has dispatched a total of 1.8 million Kuomintang and puppet troops to attack the Liberated Areas. Other newspapers have also pointed out that although a ceasefire agreement was signed as early as January 10th, the Kuomintang used ninety-nine divisions to attack the Communist troops, and these troops were secretly mobilized without notifying the Beiping Executive Headquarters. An American telegraphic news report commented on the Kuomintang's rejection of the peace proposals put forward by the Democratic League, saying: This shows that the Kuomintang is unwilling to establish peace in the country. Foreign and Chinese newspapers have reported that Kuomintang soldiers are refusing to participate in the civil war and are surrendering to the Communist troops, and the number is increasing every day. A reporter from the American "Newsweek" magazine interviewed captured Kuomintang soldiers in Benxi Lake. They unanimously stated that they were unwilling to wage a war that would brutally kill their own compatriots, and that they had been deceived into participating in the civil war. In other areas, captured Kuomintang officers and soldiers also expressed their desire to stop the civil war in Manchuria so that they could return home.

    马西努论中国局势
    【新华社延安十九日电】莫斯科广播评论员马西努论中国时局称：国民党当局不愿意和平，在中国内战的各战线上，继续集中了大批国民党军队。上海联合日报驻北平记者获悉，在各战线上，国民党集中了三十五个集团军，共约一百余万人，同时再加上各地改编的伪军，计在华北有四十五万人，山海关有三十五万人，国民党共调派了一百八十万国民党军与伪军部队进攻解放区。其他报纸亦都指出，虽然早在一月十日已签订了停战协定，但国民党却以九十九个师向中共军进攻，而且这些军队是秘密调动的，并没有通知北平执行部。美国电讯报对国民党拒绝民主同盟所提出的和平建议评称：这显示国民党是不愿在国内建立和平的证明。外国及中国报纸，都纷纷揭载国民党兵士拒绝参加内战，而向中共军投降的事实，而且每天都在增多。美每周新闻杂志记者访问本溪湖被俘国民党兵士，他们都一致声明他们不愿意进行惨杀自己同胞的战争，他们都是被骗来参加内战的。在其他区域，被俘的国民党官兵也都渴望在满洲停止内战，使他们有可能回家去。
