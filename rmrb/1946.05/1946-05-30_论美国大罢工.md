　　On the Great Strike in the United States
    Liu Zunqi
    I. The Atomic Bomb of American Society
    The American labor unrest that followed the end of the war, starting with disputes over partial wages, turned into local strikes. Local strikes developed into large-scale strikes in monopolistic industries such as electricity and steel. The largest strike in the United States in the past was in 1937, when the number of strikers was only over 500,000. This time, the number of workers directly stopping work, until recently, reached 1,786,000, more than three times that of 1937, hailed as an unprecedented great strike in the United States.
    At the same time, the 1,300 factories belonging to U.S. Steel Corporation, distributed in 33 states, are the most important source of materials for the nation's basic industries. Basic industries that depend on it for production, such as shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, and machinery manufacturing, employed 5.34 million workers according to 1941 statistics. If the steel strike continues for a long time, all these basic industry workers will inevitably stop working, and the impact may evolve into a major crisis in American industrial production.
    Because the impact and scale of the strike were too significant, the U.S. government had to actively mediate. Thus, President Truman's policies regarding labor, profits, prices, and the American industrial production system became the focus of attention. If Truman's mediation succeeds, satisfying both labor and management in resolving the dispute, he might be able to maintain the public support that President Roosevelt had in his later years; if his mediation fails or only favors one side, he and the Democratic Party will lose public support. We know that Roosevelt's third election was basically due to the workers' votes. If Truman loses the support of the workers, given the broad power of American labor unions today, he will inevitably be isolated and helpless. Although he has three years left in his term, a third of the members of Congress will be re-elected at the end of this year, and whether the workers support him or not will have a decisive effect on his future political fate. In this respect, this great strike is indeed full of strong political significance.
    In addition, this great strike can be said to have been conceived during the war. Due to the end of the war, all the causes were stimulated, leading to today's turbulent situation, which is by no means accidental. Capitalists want to maintain the lucrative profits of the war boom and are unwilling to relax even after the war ends, instead reducing the actual income of workers. During the war, the labor side saw a large amount of profit being seized by capitalists, and naturally felt resentful, but after all, in order to concentrate on increasing production and defeating the fascist enemy as early as possible, they tolerated the burden as long as they could make a living. But now that the war is over, they have to compete with the capitalists for their own long-term survival and better living conditions. This is the inherent root of the American capitalist production system at its peak, and anyone who pays a little attention would have foreseen that it would inevitably erupt during the post-war recovery period. In today's world where production economies are rapidly leaning towards socialism, the great strike in the United States cannot but be considered to contain the meaning of social revolution, and can also be said to be an atomic bomb hidden inside American society.
    II. Excessive Disparity Between Labor and Capital
    According to official U.S. government surveys, the average annual total profit of manufacturing companies in the pre-war period (1936-1939) was $2,142.2 million. This year (1946), if companies are willing to increase wages by 14 percent, they can have a profit of $6.3 billion after taxes, which is three times that of the pre-war period. Even if wages are increased by 24 percent, companies can still achieve a profit of $4.8 billion this year, which is more than twice that of the pre-war period.
    The initial demand of American striking workers was to increase wages by 30 percent. According to the above statistics, even if capitalists fully accept this demand, they can still maintain twice the pre-war profits, excluding all taxes. Recently, the U.S. excess profits tax law is about to be abolished. If they do not pay the excess profits tax, American capitalists still have the ability to increase wages by another 10 percent, while still maintaining twice the pre-war profits.
    As for companies outside of manufacturing, such as wholesale, retail, service, and other enterprises, according to government surveys, profits in 1946 can reach $10.2 billion, which is also equal to three times the pre-war period. Before the war, the average annual profit of these industries was $3,399.9 million.
    American capitalists have obtained staggering profits during the four years of war. Their appetites have grown. Although all industries have shifted to peacetime production, they stubbornly maintain three times the pre-war profits. This is what workers are most unbearable about at present.
    What is the income situation of American workers?
    The average nominal weekly wage per person for workers in manufacturing was $26.64 in January 1941; $47.12 in April 1945. Superficially, it increased by 77 percent (but the capitalists' profits tripled!).
    In reality, due to rising prices and income tax payments, the average weekly wage actually received was $31.47, which is only 18 percent higher than in 1941.
    As soon as the war ended, capitalists cancelled overtime pay, and workers' salaries were reduced across the board. The average nominal weekly wage fell to only $33.96. Thus, the actual wage of workers decreased by 28 percent compared to the actual wage in April 1945. After paying income tax, the purchasing power of the $33.96 nominal weekly wage that workers receive under today's high prices is only equivalent to $23.95, which is a decrease of 10 percent compared to January 1941.
    In other words, the capitalists' profits have tripled; the workers' wages have increased by 10 percent—this is the most direct cause of the current labor unrest.
    The main demand of the workers in the current strike factories is: the wages for a normal 40-hour work week should be approximately the same as the wages for a 48-hour work week during the war. The highest demand is no more than 30 percent, and the lowest is no more than 20 percent.
    The capitalists insist that this increase is impossible, on the grounds that most prices are still limited, the entire production during peacetime has not yet been on track, and costs cannot be accurately calculated.
    This dispute almost began after Japan's surrender.
    III. The Course of the Great Strike
    On August 18 last year, 200,000 workers of General Motors Company began to make demands for wage increases. The management fundamentally refused to consider it, and the two sides confronted each other for two or three months. All workers began to strike on November 21, and it has been two and a half months now.
    336,000 meatpacking workers also made demands for wage increases on the 11th, but the management had no sincerity to consider it, and finally began to strike on January 16. On January 23, Truman ordered the federal government to take over all meatpacking factories involved in the labor unrest in order to maintain social meat consumption. However, because the government did not change wages, most of the workers did not return to work.
    The General Electric Company strike began on January 15, with approximately 200,000 workers participating. When the electrical workers went on strike, the 263,000 telephone workers and operators across the country held a sympathy strike, but soon returned to work.
    The mainstream of the current strike is still the 750,000 steelworkers. Their wage increase demands were proposed as early as September. After labor-management negotiations and government mediation, there were no results. Initially, the steelworkers' union decided to strike on January 14, but because Truman designated an agency to try to mediate, the workers reduced the amount of the wage increase from 25 percent to 15 percent, and only demanded an increase of 19.5 cents per hour. The management conceded to 17.5 cents. The government's "fact-finding group" suggested an increase of 18.5 cents, which the labor side had already accepted, but the management firmly refused. The difference of only one cent led to the great steel strike. It has been almost a month since it began on January 20. During this period, some steel mills in the western United States individually signed contracts with the union to increase wages by 18.5 cents, but only tens of thousands of people have returned to work in this way.
    The current labor unrest is not only in a serious stalemate; but new strikes are still continuing. On February 4, 3,500 barge workers in New York went on strike, and 35,000 dockworkers unanimously supported it, while launching a sympathy strike, causing the entire transportation in New York Harbor to be suspended, and the city's food and fuel supply was severely hit.
    On the same day, workers from the six major milk companies in Kansas also voted to strike because their request for a 29-cent increase was unsuccessful.
    An entire city of workers, called Stanwait (Connecticut), numbering 10,000, held a sympathy general strike for one day to support the machine workers who had been on strike since November 8. This is a dramatic event in this great strike.
    IV. Several Characteristics
    There are several noteworthy characteristics of this great strike in the United States that should be pointed out. These characteristics have a profound impact on the future political and economic development of the United States and the labor movement.
    First, the united front of workers.
    There are two major labor organizations in the United States: one is the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), whose leader is Murray. Its political consciousness is very strong, with strong progressive views. Domestically, it is the backbone of the National Political Action Committee, supporting all progressive and democratic measures. Abroad, it supports international labor organizations and the movement for world peace and collective security. The other major labor organization is the American Federation of Labor (AFL). This is a right-leaning group that is anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and opposes participating in foreign affairs. These two major groups are competing for leadership in the national labor movement and rarely cooperate on overall issues. However, the wave of strikes this time is being carried out jointly and consistently by them. For example, the meatpacking workers' strike was first launched by 200,000 members belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and then 135,000 workers belonging to the American Federation of Labor jointly responded and acted consistently. The general strike in Stanford City (⑴⑵) mentioned above was completely consistent among members of the two major groups.
    Second, opposition to the unrestricted seizure of profits, taking into account the sound economy of society. If prices rise along with wage increases, not only will the actual income of workers not be improved, but the general public will also suffer. The two groups leading the great strike in the United States this time, while insisting on the demand for wage increases, solemnly expressed their opposition to raising prices. That is to say, they only want capitalists to take out a portion of their profits to subsidize workers' lives, instead of blindly increasing superficial salaries as in the past, and they are even more unwilling to burden the general public as a result.
    The boss of General Motors Company stated on this point: unless the wage increase is counted as a new cost and the selling price of goods is increased accordingly, not a single cent of wages can be increased. The workers firmly oppose this attitude. They oppose passing on the wage increase to the burden of general consumers, so that capitalists can still maintain their original generous profits.
    This kind of social consciousness shown by American workers is very noteworthy. In the past and even now, there is still a faction of union leaders in the United States, such as Lewis of the coal miners' union, who only care about demanding wage increases, regardless of how high the capitalists raise the selling price, and do not care about it, and have lost most of the sympathy of society. In this great strike, American public groups have set up porridge shops everywhere to provide free meals to striking workers, which proves that their new strategy is very successful. Because they have united their own interests with the interests of the majority of the people in society.
    Third, the problems of the American capitalist production system have been raised.
    Workers' demands for wage increases under the principle of not raising prices have already marked a new stage for the American labor movement. But equally important is the American government's mediation method, which puts the issues of wages, profits, and price adjustments in American capitalist production on the agenda of future American socio-economic movements.
    Truman announced on December 3 the method of mediating the labor unrest, which is divided into two items: (1) For any enterprise where labor unrest has occurred, the government may send impartial people to establish a "fact-finding group" to investigate whether the company has the ability to increase wages. Although he did not require the company to "open the books" to accept public investigation, he stated that "there is no reason for the company not to cooperate with this investigation work." (2) He hopes that workers will have a "calm period" of about 30 days before the "fact-finding group" completes its work, and that they will not strike.
    This method was attacked by both labor and management. The management opposed the former, and the labor opposed the latter. However, the labor side later stated that if the capitalists are willing to open the books to allow society to check whether they have the ability to increase wages, the labor is willing to respect the government's mediation.
    Investigating the company's books to determine whether the company should pay more wages was originally not something that the government had the right to handle, unless Congress specifically granted the president this privilege. Therefore, General Motors Company published a huge advertisement in national newspapers on January 5, saying that "the method of investigating the books will sooner or later develop to such a day that the existing corporate privileges will be deprived by labor to the fullest extent." And said that Truman's theory of "deciding how much wages should be increased based on the ability to pay wages" would "completely subvert the entire American free enterprise system." They believe that maintaining as much profit as possible is the only stimulus for American free enterprise, and keeping the secrets of profit and letting the capitalists decide the amount of wages themselves is a sacred and inviolable right of capitalism.
    So far, Truman has designated "fact-finding groups" in several enterprises involved in labor unrest, but because the companies have always refused to check the accounts, this work cannot provide the most complete and powerful evidence. The investigators can only base their conclusions on government tax figures and the facts and figures provided by the union. None of their conclusions have been adopted by the management.
    Here arises the issue of President Truman's credibility. If the "fact-finding" policy continues to fail in this way, the labor unrest will inevitably continue to expand, and the future is really unpredictable. If Truman insists on implementing this policy, he must face the major issue of "revision of American capitalism." The unions now unanimously support Truman's "accounting check" policy. Whether Du has the courage to ask Congress to interfere with the privileges of capitalist administration is a question of great importance in the future.
    V. Conclusion
    The world economy is still in a state of coexistence of socialist and capitalist systems. However, due to the great success of Soviet socialism and its amazing victory in Europe, many European countries have gradually transformed from the decadent capitalist shells, adopting socialist programs to varying degrees. Like Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Hungary, parts of Germany and Austria, Czechoslovakia, although the private property system still exists, the nationalization of land distribution and heavy industry, forests, minerals, and transportation is no longer a purely capitalist mode of production. Even in France and Britain, the nationalization of public utilities is also being implemented step by step, and the government is limiting the amount of profits of private enterprises in order to protect the public interest.
    The only major power in the world that rigidly adheres to the capitalist profit-seeking mode of production is the United States. In the United States, free enterprise has long been occupied by a few cartel monopoly capital. American capitalist democracy has long lost its soul due to the lack of economic democracy. This great strike can also be said to be a struggle for workers to win economic democracy. In this regard, it has profound global significance.

　　论美国大罢工
    刘尊棋
    一  美国社会的原子弹
    紧接着战争结束而来的美国工潮，从一部分工资的争议，变为局部的罢工。从局部的罢工发展为电气与钢铁等垄断工业的大罢工。过去美国最大规模的罢工是在一九三七年，当时罢工人数不过五十余万。这一次直接停止工作的工人，到最近为止，共达一百七十八万六千人，比一九三七年大过三倍，号称为美国空前未有的大罢工。
    同时，美国钢铁公司所属的一千三百家工厂，分布在三十三个州，是全国基本工业的最重要材料来源。依赖它而生产的基本工业，如造船、造车、机器制造等，根据一九四一年的统计，已雇用五百三十四万工人。如果钢铁业的罢工旷日持久下去，所有这些基本工业的工人，势将停止工作，影响所及，可能演成美国工业生产的重大危机。
    由于罢工影响和规模过于重大，美国政府不能不积极调处，于是杜鲁门总统对于劳工、对于利润、对于物价、对于美国的工业生产制度所采取的政策，就成为各方注目的焦点。倘若杜鲁门的调处成功，使得劳资满意解决争端，他或许还能保持罗斯福总统后半期的公众支持；如果他的调处失败，或只偏袒了一方面，他和民主党就会失却公众的支持。我们知道，罗斯福第三任当选，基本上是靠工人的投票。杜鲁门如果失却工人的支持，在今天美国工会的广大势力之下，必定孤立无援。虽然他的任期还有三年，但是今年年底就要有三分之一的会议员改选，工人支持不支持，对他今后施政的命运，有决定的作用。在这一点上，这一次的大罢工实在富有浓厚的政治意义。
    此外这一次的大罢工可以说是在战争期间内就孕育了下来，由于战争的结束，一切原因都激发出来，以至演成今日奔腾澎湃之局，决不是偶然发生的。资本家要保持战争繁荣期的肥美利润，虽在战争终了后，仍不肯放松一步，反来减削工人的实际收入。劳工方面在战争期内，看到大量利润给资本家攫夺去了，自然很愤恨，但毕竟为了集中全力增加生产，好提早击败法西斯敌人，只要生活得下去，也就隐忍负重了。但战争既已完结，却不得不为本身长期的生存，和较好的生活，而与资本家一争短长。这是达于烂熟期的美国资本主义生产制度的内在病根，凡是稍加留心的人，早就会预见到在战后复员时期必然要暴发的。在全世界生产经济急剧倾向于社会主义方面的今天，美国的大罢工不能不认为含有社会革命的意义，也可以说是美国社会内部藏着的一颗原子弹。
    二  劳资悬殊过甚
    根据美国政府的官方调查，美国制造工业的公司，在战前（一九三六——一九三九）每年平均的利润总额是二十一万万四千二百万元。在今年（一九四六）年内，公司如肯增加工资百分之十四，除了捐税外，可有利润六十三万万元，就是说战前的三倍。即使增加工资百分之二十四，公司今年的利润也可以达到四十八亿元，即为战前的二倍以上。
    美国罢工工人的最初要求是增加工资百分之三十。依照上面的统计，资本家纵使完全接收这个要求，也还可以保持战前利润的两倍，一切捐税除开在外。最近美国的过分利得税法就要取销了，如果不缴过分利得税，美国资本家还有能力再增加百分之十的工资，而依然保持战前利润的两倍。
    至于制造业以外的公司，如批发、零售、服务等企业，据政府调查，一九四六年内利润可达一百零二万万元，也等于战前的三倍。战前这些工业每年平均利润是三十三亿九千九百万元。
    美国资本家在四年战争期间已经获得惊人的利润，他们的胃口已经养大了，虽然一切工业转入和平时期的生产，但仍执拗地维持战前三倍的利润。这是目前工人最不堪忍受的事。
    美国的工人收入情形怎样呢？
    在制造业中的工人，平均每星期每人的名义工资，一九四一年一月间是二六·六四元；一九四五年四月是四七·一二元。表面上增加了百分之七十七（资本家的利润却是三倍！）。
    实际上，由于物价高涨和缴纳所得税之故，平均每周的工资，实得三一·四七元，即较一九四一年仅增高百分之十八。
    战争一结束，资本家把赶工费取消了，工人的薪阶一律降低，平均每周的名义工资只落得三三·九六元。这样，工人的实际工资较一九四五年四月的实际工资减少了百分之二八。除了交纳所得税，工人在今天的高物价下每周所得三三、九六元名义工资的购买力，只合得到二三·九五元，即反较一九四一年一月减少了百分之十。
    换句话说，资本家的利润增加了三倍；工人的工资增加了百分之十——这是当前工潮最直接的原因。
    目前几个罢工厂的工人要求，主要在一点：即平时每周四十小时工作的工资，应与战时每周四十八小时的工资差不多。最高的要求不过百分之三十，最低的不过百分之二十。
    资本家则坚持这种增加是不可能的，理由是物价大部还是限定着的，平时的全部生产还未上轨道，成本不能精确计算出来。
    这个争执差不多在日本投降后就开始了。
    三  大罢工经过
    去年八月十八日通用汽车公司的二十万工人开始提出增资的要求，资方根本拒绝考虑，双方相持了两三个月。十一月二十一日全体工人开始罢工到现在已是两个半月了。
    肉类装制工人三十三万六千人，也是在十一日间就提出了增资要求的，资方毫无考虑的诚意，终于一月十六日起开始罢工，一月二十三日杜鲁门下令由联邦政府接收所有卷入工潮的肉类工厂，以维持社会肉类消费。但因政府不变更工资，工人大部分都没有复工。
    通用电气公司的罢工是从一月十五日开始，参加工人约二十万。当电气工人罢工时，全国二十六万三千电话工人和接线生虽举行同情罢工，未几又复工。
    目前罢工的主流还是七十五万钢铁工人。他们的增资要求是早在九月间即已提出，经过劳资折冲，政府调处，毫无结果。最初钢铁工会决议于一月十四日起罢工，后因杜鲁门指定机构试图调解，工人把增资的数目从百分之二十五降低至百分之十五，每小时工资只要求增加一角九分五。资方让步到一角七分五。政府的“事实调查组”调处建议增加一角八分五，工方业已接受，但资方坚决拒绝，只差一分钱之微，酿成钢铁业的大罢工。从一月二十日开始转瞬也快一个月了。在这期间，美国西部一些钢铁厂个别的与工会签订增资一角八分五的合同，但这样复工的不过几万人。
    目前的工潮不但在严重僵持之中；而且新的罢工还在继续不已。二月四日起纽约的驳船工人三千五百名实行罢工，码头工人三万五千人一致支援，同时发动了同情罢工，以致纽约港的运输为之整个停顿，全市的食物和燃料供应，受到了严重打击。
    同一天内，甘萨斯的六大牛奶公司工人因要求增资二角九分未遂，也已表决罢工。
    一个叫做斯丹伟特的小城（康纳第可特州）全体工人一万人，为了声援从十一月八日起开始罢工的机械工人，曾举行同情总罢工一天。这是这次大罢工中个富有戏剧意味的事件。
    四  几个特点
    这一次美国的大罢工有几个最可注意的特点，应该指出。这些特点与美国今后的政治经济发展和劳工运动都有很深刻的影响。
    第一，工人的联合阵线。
    美国顶大的劳工组织有两个：一个是产业团体大会（也有人译作工业组织大会，即CIO Congress of Industrial Organizations）领袖是慕莱，它的政治意识很强，有浓厚的进步性，在国内为全国政治行动委员会的骨干，支持一切进步民主的措施；在国外，支持国际劳工的组织，支持世界和平与集体安全的运动。另外一个大的劳工组织，是美国劳工联合会，即AFLAmerican Federation of Labor。这是一个右倾的团体，反苏，反共，反对参加国外的事务。这两大团体在全国工运中在争领导地位，很少在全面问题上合作。但是这回罢工的浪潮，却是它们联合一致进行的。例如肉类装制工人的罢工，先是属于产业团体大会的二十万会员发起的，随着属于美国劳工联合会的十三万五千工人便联合响应，一致行动。上述斯丹佛特城（⑴⑵）的总罢工，两大团体的会员完全是一致的。
    第二，反对无限制的利润攫夺，顾及到社会的健全经济。如果工资增加之后，物价随之增涨，不但工人实际的收入并无补益，而且使一般社会公众受累。美国这次领导大罢工的两个团体，在坚持增加工资的要求时，严正表示反对增高物价。这就是说，他们只是要资本家拿出一部分利润来贴补工人生活，而不象过去那样肓目地仅仅增加表面的薪给而已，更不愿因此而累及社会一般公众。
    通用汽车公司的老板对这一点表示：除非把工资的增加，算作新的成本，照数提高物品的售价，否则一分钱工资都能不能增加。工人坚决反对这个态度。他们反对把工资的增加部分转嫁到一般消耗者的负担上去，而使资本家依然维持他们原来的丰厚利润。
    美国工人的这一种社会意识的表现，是非常可注意的。过去以至现在美国还有一派工会领袖，例如煤矿工会的鲁易士之流，只顾要求增资，不管资本家把售价提高到多么高，却不去过问，曾经失掉社会的大部同情。这回大罢工中间，美国民众团体在各地纷纷设立粥厂免费给罢工工人用膳，就证明他们的新战略是很成功的。因为他们把自己的利益和社会上大多数人民的利益统一了起来。
    第三，美国资本主义生产制度问题被提出来了。
    工人要求在不提高物价的原则之下增加工资，已经为美国的工运划出了一个新的阶段。但同样有的，是美国政府的调解方式，把美国资本主义生产中的意义工资、利润、和物价的调整问题，提到今后美国社会经济运动的课程表上来了。
    杜鲁门于十二月三日宣布调处工潮的办法，分为两项：（一）对于任何发生了工潮的企业，政府得派公正人士设立“事实调查组”，调查公司有无能力增加工资。他虽没有要求公司必需把“帐簿打开”来，接受公开的调查，但他表示“公司没有理由不和这种调查工作合作”。（二）他希望在“事实调查组”工作完成前，工人有一个“镇静期间”，大约为三十天，不得罢工。
    这个办法受到了劳资双方的夹攻。资方反对前者，劳方反对后者。不过后来劳方表示，倘若资本家肯把帐簿打开让社会检查有无增加工资的能力，则劳工愿尊重政府的调处。
    调验公司的帐簿，以确定公司应否付出更多的工资，原不是政府有权办理的事，除非国会特别授与总统这种特权。所以通用汽车公司于一月五日在全国报纸刊登巨幅广告，说“调验帐簿的办法，迟早会发展到这么一天，那时现有的公司特权都要被劳工剥夺以尽。”并且说杜鲁门的“根据支付工资能力来决定应加多少工资”的理论，“会把美国全部自由企业制度颠覆无遗”的。他们认为保持利润越多越好，是美国自由企业的唯一刺激因素，而保守利润的秘密，由资本家自己决定工资的数目，更是资本主义神圣不可侵犯的权力。
    迄今为止，杜鲁门已经在几个卷入工潮的企业中指定了“事实调查组”，但因为公司始终拒绝查帐，这种工作就不能提供最完整有力的证据。调查人员只能根据政府税收数字与工会所提供的事实和数字，他们的结论没有一次被资方采纳过。
    这里就发生了杜鲁门总统的威信问题。如果“事实调查”政策这样失败下去，工潮必将持续扩大，前途实在不可逆料。如果杜鲁门坚持贯彻这一政策，他就必须面对着“美国资本主义的修正”的重大问题。工会现在是一致支持杜鲁门的“查帐”政策的。杜氏有无勇气向国会要求干涉资本家行政的特权，是今后极可重视的一个问题。
    五  结语
    世界经济还是在社会主义与资本主义两大体系的并存状态中。但是由于苏联社会主义的伟大成功，它在欧洲的惊人胜利，许多欧洲的国家，已经渐次从颓唐的资本主义躯壳中蜕变，或多或少地采行着社会主义的方案。象波兰、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫、保加利亚、匈牙利、一部分德国和奥国，捷克斯拉夫，虽然私有财产制度照旧存在，但土地分配和重工业与森林、矿产、交通的国家化，已经不再是单纯的资本主义生产方式了。甚至于法国和英国，公用企业的国有化也在着着实行，政府为了保障公众利益，对私人企业的利润多少都在加以限制。
    一成不变地牢守着资本主义利润追求的生产方式，在世界主要列强中，只有一个美国了。在美国，自由企业早已为少数卡迭尔的垄断资本所霸占了。美国资本主义的民主，早已因缺乏经济的民主而失去了灵魂。这一次大罢工，也可以说是工人争取经济民主的斗争。在这一点上，是具有深刻的世界意义的。
