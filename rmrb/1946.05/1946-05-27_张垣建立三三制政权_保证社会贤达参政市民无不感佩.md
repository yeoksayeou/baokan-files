　　Zhangjiakou Establishes a "Three-Three System" Government
    Guaranteeing Participation of Social Elites in Politics, Citizens Are Universally Impressed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 23rd] The Zhangjiakou Municipal Government Committee held its first meeting on the 16th. In addition to Mayor Yang Chunfu and Deputy Mayor Zhang Mengxu, elected by the Municipal People's Council, it was decided that Quan Zemin, Yun Ziqiang, and others would take charge of social affairs, education, finance, construction, and public security, respectively. Among the nine members of the Municipal Government Committee, besides Yang Chunfu, Zhang Mengxu, and Quan Zemin, who are Communists, the rest are respected figures from all walks of life who enjoy broad popular support. For example, Professor Yun Ziqiang, the principal of the Municipal Technical College, taught at universities such as Shanghai Aurora University for twenty years and is a righteous natural scientist. Mr. Li Jiesan served as a provincial councilor in Zhili, Chahar, and other provinces. Later, dissatisfied with the corrupt one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang, he retired to his rural home. Mr. Hong Ziliang is a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. Wang Rongren, a small businessman, has been managing the Fifth and Seventh District Cooperative since the liberation of Zhangjiakou, organizing mass economic production with remarkable results. Li Jingnan has been in the industrial and commercial sector for more than twenty years and is currently the manager of the Fuheyi Tannery in the city. Li Qiutian is an enlightened landlord with more than ten hectares of land and more than twenty houses. He believes that the Communist Party's policy of rent reduction and payment of rent is very reasonable and beneficial to all strata. The broad masses of Zhangjiakou citizens are all moved and impressed by the Communist Party's earnest practice of the "Three-Three System" policy, guaranteeing the participation of socially just people in government affairs.
