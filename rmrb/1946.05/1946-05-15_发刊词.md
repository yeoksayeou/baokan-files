　　Inaugural Statement

　　This newspaper – People's Daily, the newspaper of the broad masses of people in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region – is published.

　　The people, the Eighth Route Army, and the Communist Party in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region demonstrated boundless spirit of hardship, bravery and sacrifice in the eight years of driving out the Japanese invaders and saving the entire Chinese nation from peril. They shattered countless savage encroachments, offensives, and sweeps by the enemy and puppets over eight years, and persevered in the arduous war of resistance behind enemy lines. After the Japanese surrendered, in the five months of struggle to eliminate enemy puppets, halt the civil war, and strive for peace, the people, the Eighth Route Army, and the Communist Party of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu continued to demonstrate boundless spirit of hardship, bravery and sacrifice. They substantially eliminated enemy puppet remnants, expanded the territory of the liberated areas, severely struck blows against the reactionary civil war provocateurs who invaded the liberated areas, and cooperated with the nationwide struggle for peace and democracy, striving for the start of a national peaceful construction phase. The people of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region have made enormous contributions to the nation, to peace, and to democracy. The publication of this newspaper lies in carrying forward the traditional spirit of the people of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region in driving out the Japanese invaders, loving the nation, and loving peace and democracy.

　　Currently, the people, the Eighth Route Army, and the Communist Party in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu are continuing to deeply engage in the mass movements of anti-traitor accusations, grievance airing, and revenge seeking, as well as the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement, deeply engaging in production and military training movements, carrying out rectification and demobilization, economic and cultural construction, and other aspects of work in order to consolidate domestic peace and adhere to the three major agreements of the Political Consultative Conference and the realization of all its resolutions. However, we feel that the victorious realization of the national cause of peace and democracy is an extraordinarily arduous project. The reactionary civil war provocateurs are brewing a nationwide civil war. The civil war in the Northeast is continuing to expand. The Kuomintang reactionary army surrounding the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army is attempting to encircle and annihilate the Fifth Division. The Kuomintang reactionary armies around our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu are also busy mobilizing and actively preparing for offensives. This means that civil war is threatening the national cause of peace and democracy, and is also threatening the work of peaceful and democratic construction in our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. The publication of this newspaper will mobilize and organize the people of the entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region to rise up and adhere to the full realization of the PCC resolutions, adhere to mass self-defense struggles, especially strengthening the leadership and organization of mass self-defense warfare in border areas, preparing to crush the reactionaries' offensives at any time, and defend the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area.

　　In order to implement the full realization of the PCC resolutions and further consolidate the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region is launching the anti-traitor accusations, grievance airing, and revenge seeking movement, and the rent reduction movement. This movement still needs to be further developed universally and deeply. Today, the main shortcomings are not being "left," but not being bold and unfettered enough, but a few people's crude actions, and there are still many blanks, and a partial lack of attention to grasping the necessary policies towards middle peasants and others. The production movement is not deep in some areas, and must be checked in a timely manner to ensure its depth. Protecting the wheat harvest in the border areas, and the cultivation after the wheat harvest, should be prepared for immediately. The work of military training and rectification and demobilization is already underway in all troops, but this work must be closely integrated with the preparation for self-defense struggle. Naturally, we are unwilling to have a civil war and resolutely advocate peace, but once the civil war provocateurs force us to accept civil war, we can only rise up and resolutely defend ourselves, giving the reactionaries a resolute counterattack, and we must not relax our preparations for self-defense operations because of military training, rectification, and demobilization. Our democratic, economic, cultural, transportation, and other construction work, although already actively underway, we believe is not enough and needs to be further developed. Promoting these many aspects of work and seeking its further development and deepening, in order to achieve further consolidation of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, will be a very heavy task for the publication of this newspaper!

　　Our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region's mountains and plains were once divided by the enemy for a long period, and the connection between the mountains and plains was greatly restricted. In the victorious march of eliminating the enemy puppets, the four regions, mountains and plains have been connected into one piece. Although the exchange and communication of experience have increased many conveniences in the future, however, due to the continuous blockade and division by the enemy puppets for seven or eight years in several regions, and the different conditions of the work foundation, environment, history, and experience in each region, there are still many differences in the work. How to more extensively, more fully, and more frequently exchange the experience of struggle and the experience of work in this region and that region, in the mountains and plains, in order to achieve more uniform steps in each region, more balanced development of work, and more concentrated forces, will also be a very important mission entrusted to this newspaper by the struggle!

　　This newspaper – People's Daily, the newspaper of the broad masses of people in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region – is published under everyone's enthusiastic expectation and encouragement, and under extremely incomplete conditions. This is a thing worth celebrating! Regarding its development, growth, and strength, we warmly hope for the support and help of the Party, government, army, and people throughout the border region, and the vast number of reader comrades! Our slogan is what Chairman Mao Zedong shows us: Serve the people wholeheartedly! This is also the newspaper’s policy and purpose.

　　发刊词
    本报——人民日报，晋冀鲁豫边区广大人民的报纸出版了。
    晋冀鲁豫边区的人民、八路军、共产党在为驱逐日寇，挽救全中华民族危亡的八年过程中，曾经表现了无限艰苦英勇牺牲的精神，粉碎了敌伪八年来无数次野蛮的蚕食、进攻和扫荡，坚持了敌后的艰苦抗战。日寇投降以后，在肃清敌伪，制止内战，争取和平的五个月的斗争中，晋冀鲁豫的人民、八路军、共产党，继续表现了无限艰苦英勇牺牲的精神，大量的肃清敌伪残余，扩大了解放区的领土，严重的打击了侵入解放区的反动派内战挑拨者，配合全国和平民主的斗争，争取了全国和平建设阶段的开始到来。晋冀鲁豫边区的人民对于民族、和平、民主是曾经有过极大贡献的。本报的出版，在于发扬晋冀鲁豫边区人民驱逐日寇，热爱民族，热爱和平民主的传统精神。
    现在晋冀鲁豫的人民、八路军、共产党，正在为着巩固国内和平，坚持政治协商会的三大协议，及其全部决议的实现，而继续深入广大群众反奸诉苦复仇运动、减租减息运动，深入生产练兵运动，开展整编复员，经济文化建设等各方面的工作中。然而我们感觉到：全国和平民主事业的胜利实现，这一工程是异常艰巨的，反动派内战挑拨者，正在酝酿着全国规模的内战，东北的内战在继续扩大，包围新四军五师的国民党反动派的军队，正在企图围歼第五师；我晋冀鲁豫四周的国民党反动军队，亦在忙于调动和积极的进攻准备中，这就是说内战正在威胁全国和平民主事业，同时也在威胁我晋冀鲁豫边区和平民主建设的工作。本报的出版，它将要动员和组织全晋冀鲁豫边区的人民，起来坚持政协决议的全部实现，坚持群众性的自卫斗争，特别是加强边沿地区群众性自卫战争的领导与组织，准备随时击破反动派的进攻，保卫晋冀鲁豫解放区。
    为着贯彻政协决定的全部实现，和晋冀鲁豫边区的进一步巩固，我晋冀鲁豫边区正在展开反奸诉苦复仇运动、减租运动，这一运动还须进一步求得普遍开展和深入；今天主要的缺点不是什么左，而是不够大胆放手，而是少数人的蛮干，而是还有很多空白，和部分的不注意掌握对于中农及其他必要的政策。生产运动有些区域并不深入，还须及时检查，求其深入，保卫边沿区的麦收，及麦收后的耕种，目前即应加以准备。练兵与整编复员工作，已在所有部队中进行，但这一工作必须与自卫斗争的准备密切结合起来，自然我们是不愿意内战，坚决主张和平的，但是一旦内战挑拨者逼迫着我们接受内战，只有起来坚决自卫，给反动派以坚决的还击，决不能因为练兵整编复员而松懈我们自卫作战的准备。我们的民主、经济、文化，交通等各方面的建设工作，虽然已经在积极进行之中，但我们认为还不够，还须进一步的展开。推动这许多方面的工作，并求其进一步的开展深入，以达到晋冀鲁豫边区进一步的巩固，将是本报出版十分繁重的任务！
    我晋冀鲁豫边区的山地和平原，过去曾经被敌人长时期的分割，山地和平原的联系受到不少限制，在肃清敌伪的胜利进军中，已经把四个地区，山地和平原联成一片了，今后经验的交换和沟通，虽然增加了许多的便利，然而由于几个地区七八年来受敌伪不断封锁分割，和各地区工作基础、环境、历史、经验等的条件不同，工作上还存在许多差别。今后如何更广泛的、更充分的、更经常的，交换这个地区和那个地区、山地和平原各方面斗争的经验和工作的经验，以达到各地区步骤的更加齐一，工作的更加平衡发展，力量的更加集中，亦将是斗争赋予本报非常重要的使命！
    本报——人民日报，晋冀鲁豫边区广大人民的报纸，在大家热烈期待和鼓励之下，在极不完备的条件之中出版了，这是值得庆幸的一件事情！关于它的发展、壮大、坚强，我们热烈希望全边区党政军民及广大读者同志们的扶植与帮助！我们的口号是毛主席昭示我们的：全心全意为人民服务！这也就是本报的方针和宗旨。
