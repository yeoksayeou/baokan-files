　　Three Hundred Li of the Ping-Sui Railway Opens to Traffic
    Highway Links to Western Shanxi and Northern Shaanxi
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 17th] The Ping-Sui Railway within the Sui-Meng Area has reached over 320 li of operational track. From April 7th, the Fengzhen to Gushan section has also begun handling passenger and freight transport, with large quantities of grain being transported south to Datong. In the Sui-Meng Area, highways open to traffic include Fengzhen to Liangcheng, Liangcheng to Xigoumen, Fengzhen to Jining, Zuoyun, Youyu, and other places, totaling over 1,200 li. The Bawang River Bridge east of Jining City, which was destroyed by the enemy five years ago, is currently under urgent repair. Once this bridge is completed, transportation between Mongols and Han people between Jining and Hongge'ertu will be unimpeded. The Feng (zhen)-Li (shi) trunk line spanning Jin and Sui, spanning one hundred li, has begun to open to traffic. The first test vehicle has safely arrived in Xingxian from Fengzhen. At the southern end of the Feng-Li trunk line is the Li (shi)-Liu (lin) branch line, which connects with the Sui (de)-Wu (bao) branch line of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. In order to protect the roadbed, the Border Region Government Office and Military Region Headquarters have jointly issued a notice strictly prohibiting public and private large vehicles from traveling on the road surface.
