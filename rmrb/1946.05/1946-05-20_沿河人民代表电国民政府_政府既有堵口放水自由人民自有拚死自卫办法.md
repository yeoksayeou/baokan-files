　　Representatives of People Along the River Telegraph the National Government
    Government既有堵口放水自由人民自有拚死自卫办法
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan]谷子惠, Hu Yiping, Shen Jipan and other representatives of six million residents along the river in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, telegraphed the Nanjing National Government and the National Water Conservancy Commission and Shanghai UN Relief Association concerning the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to flood the Hebei-Shandong Liberated Area. After narrating the facts of the Kuomintang authorities' deliberate attempt to flood our Hebei-Shandong Liberated Area, the telegram urgently stated: "At this moment, 30 million people in our border region are filled with resentment and boiling with anger, vowing to spare no sacrifice to save and defend themselves. The entire region is now mobilized to prevent the floodwaters from flowing north. Although the outcome is unpredictable, the will of the people is united and the anger of the masses is hard to quell. If the Heze Agreement is not implemented and the damming project is not immediately stopped, our 30 million people will inevitably be forced to take risks. Even if they face swords and spears and risk death, they will certainly have a way to save and defend themselves. In that case, it is uncertain whether the flooding will occur to the south or to the north. Who is the culprit, who is the criminal, the world and future generations will have their own judgment. Compelled to this point, we have said all we can say. Whether it is a disaster or a blessing, to go or to stay, we hope you will consider it carefully!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan] On the 15th of this month, Hebei-Shandong-Henan People's Representatives Wu Zheqing, Zhang Huayi, Shen Jipan, Pei Yuming, Hu Yangping, Gu Zihui, Gong Jingren, Yang Hanzhang, Chen Liting, Gao Zhenwu, An Jingwu and other 723 people telegraphed to Nanjing National Government Chairman Jiang, stating: "Recently, the authorities have disregarded the Heze Agreement and instead considered blocking the river mouth and flooding the people as a good plan. Is there anyone in the world who governs rivers with such disregard for human life and such cruel and brutal behavior?! If Jiang Tingfu and others are allowed to act recklessly and blindly, how will Your Excellency explain when the floodwaters inundate the provinces of Hebei and Shandong? Because, while the government has the freedom to block the river mouth and divert water, the people have their own method of fighting to the death to defend themselves. If the government breaches the dam, the people will also breach the dam. When the floodwaters flow horizontally and overflow the sky, the responsibility will rest where it belongs. Rather than chaos without governance, it is better to have governance without chaos. What to do, whether to destroy the country or to revitalize the country, depends on one word from Your Excellency. We urgently telegraph this message, hoping you will consider it carefully."

　　沿河人民代表电国民政府
    政府既有堵口放水自由人民自有拚死自卫办法
    【新华社邯郸讯】冀鲁豫三省沿河六百万居民代表谷子惠、胡隅平、申集磐等，为国民党反动派阴谋水淹冀鲁解放区，致电南京国民政府，全国水利委员会，上海联合国救济总署，该电于历述国民党当局蓄意水淹我冀鲁解放区之事实后，最后紧称：刻我边区三千万人民，业已为此而怨气冲天，热血沸腾，誓不惜任何牺牲，以自救自卫，现正全区动员阻水北泛，其结果如何虽难逆料，但众志成城，众怒难犯，如不执行荷泽协定，立即停止堵口工程，则我三千万人民，势必被迫挺而走险，纵犯锋镝，冒万死，亦必有以自救自卫，似此，则将所淹者为南为北，未可知也。谁为祸首，谁为罪魁，天下后世，自有公议。势逼处此，言尽于此，是祸是福，或去或从，幸垂察焉！
    【新华社邯郸讯】本月十五日冀鲁豫人民代表吴哲卿、张化夷、申集磐、裴毓明、胡阳平、谷子惠、巩镜人、杨汉章、陈立廷、高镇五、安经武等七百二十三人，致电南京国民政府蒋主席略称：近当局置荷泽协议于不理，反以堵口放水淹没人民为得计，似此不惜民命，凶狠残暴之行为，世间尚有此治河者乎？！假若一任蒋廷黻等之横行蛮干，则洪水淹没冀鲁两省之日，钧座何以自解？盖政府既可堵口放水之自由，人民为求生存就有拚死自卫之办法，政府决堤人民也需决堤，洪水横流泛溢天，责有攸归，与其乱而不治，何如治而不乱，何去何从，丧邦兴邦，系于钧座之一言耳。迫切电陈，幸乞垂察。    （附图片）
