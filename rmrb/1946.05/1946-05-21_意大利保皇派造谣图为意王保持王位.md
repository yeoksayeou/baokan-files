　　Italian Royalists Spread Rumors to Help the King Retain His Throne
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th Dispatch] Rome Dispatch: Italian royalists are creating rumors in an attempt to help Umberto retain his throne in the June 2nd national referendum. The royalist newspaper "Sera" reported in its afternoon edition that Umberto narrowly escaped assassination. The newspaper claimed: "According to reliable sources, Fascists attempted to throw bombs at Umberto while he was mingling with royalist demonstrators, because he had betrayed Mussolini's Fascism and the German allies." After this news broke, Italian Interior Minister Romita immediately denied it. The "Rome Observer" stated: The intention of the royalists in spreading this rumor is clearly to create political capital for Umberto.

　　意大利保皇派造谣图为意王保持王位
    【新华社延安十七日电】罗马讯：意保皇派制造谣言，图帮助安伯托于六月二日公民复决中保持王位。保皇派报纸塞拉下午报登载安伯托险遭暗杀的消息，该报称：“自可靠方面悉，法西斯分子企图当安伯托杂在保皇派示威者群中的时候，向他投掷炸弹，因为他已背叛墨索里尼法西斯主义及德国盟邦”。此消息发生后，意内政部长罗米第亚立加否认。罗马观察家称：保皇派此一谣言的意图显在为安伯托制造政治资本。
