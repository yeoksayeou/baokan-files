    Border Government Council Issues Call to All People in the Region for Self-Defense
    Our Representatives Zhao Mingfu and Others Arrive in Beijing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan] Residents along the river in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region and compatriots throughout the region, in light of the fact that the Kuomintang authorities are determined to complete the Huayuankou damming project within this month and flood our liberated areas, the situation is urgent, and they have successively petitioned, demanding a stop to this crime by the Kuomintang. The Border Region Council and the Border Government have jointly issued a letter to the 30 million people of the entire border region. The letter first recounts the various efforts made by our democratic government and the fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries have torn up the Heze Agreement and persisted in their conspiracy. It then calls out, saying: "Now this conspiracy is about to turn into an open action, we can only urgently mobilize to save ourselves and defend ourselves." The letter concludes: "We will definitely implement your opinions and demands, and strive with the greatest strength to stop the realization of this conspiracy, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal, otherwise we should also live and die with you, and share life and death, but we firmly believe that the power of the broad masses of the people can overcome any difficulties and eliminate any obstacles."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region's Kaifeng Huanghe delegation went to Nanjing on the 12th to negotiate the return of the Yellow River to its original course and stop the Huayuankou damming. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing: Zhao et al. arrived in Beijing on the 15th.
