　　【Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 9th】Military vehicles are rumbling along the Pinghan Railway. A few days ago, Kuomintang troops transported sixteen tanks and five heavy artillery pieces from Xinxiang to Huixian. Kuomintang troops in the Jin-Yu area are actively carrying out Hu Zongnan's short-term blitz training plan. The 90th Army in Mengxian and Mengjin, the 85th Army in Xinxiang, and the 1st Army in Yuncheng are specifically conducting offensive training. The 32nd Army on the Daoqing Line, the 40th Army in Anyang, and the 30th Army in Tangyin and Qixian are conducting offensive and defensive and "cleansing village" training. At 9:00 AM on the 4th, a Kuomintang aircraft flew in from the south and conducted low-altitude reconnaissance over Handan for about an hour.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th】Our reporter has just learned from reliable sources: In late April, the Kuomintang reactionaries mobilized large armies from the southern Shaanxi area, using heavy trucks through Baocheng, Fengxian and other places, and transported them to Baoji, where they were transferred to trains. Currently, military vehicles are continuously rushing north on the Sichuan-Shaanxi road, causing surprise among merchants and travelers along the way.
　　Furthermore, on April 23rd, more than seventy brand-new American ten-wheeled trucks of the Zizhong ×× Regiment, military designation 30715, etc., fully loaded with eight 27-kilogram artillery shells in each box, were transported from Baocheng in southern Shaanxi to Shuangshixing in Fengxian. After a short rest, they quickly proceeded to Baoji for eastward transportation.

    【新华社邯郸九日电】平汉路上军车辚辚，日前国民党军由新乡运抵辉县坦克十六辆重炮五门。晋豫地区国民党军，正积极进行胡宗南之短期突击训练计划。孟县及孟津之九十军，新乡之八十五军，运城之第一军，专门进行攻击训练。道清线之三十二军，安阳之四十军，汤阴、淇县之三十军，则进行攻击防御与清乡之训练。四日上午九时，由南飞来国民党飞机一架，在邯郸上空低飞侦察约一小时。
    【新华社延安十日电】记者顷从可靠方面获悉：国民党反动派在四月下旬，从陕南一带调动大军，均以载重汽车经褒城、凤县等地，运抵宝鸡，改用火车车运。现川陕路上兵车连日不绝，向北疾驰，沿途商旅莫不惊异。
    又四月廿三日辎重××团军字三零七一五号等七拾余辆美国十轮新大卡车，满载每箱装有八枚二拾七公斤重之炮弹，由陕南褒城运至凤县之双石兴，稍事休息后，复疾驰宝鸡，向东运送。
