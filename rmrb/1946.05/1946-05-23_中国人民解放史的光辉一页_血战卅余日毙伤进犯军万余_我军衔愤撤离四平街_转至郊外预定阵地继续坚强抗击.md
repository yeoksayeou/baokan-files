　　A Glorious Page in the History of the Chinese People's Liberation
    Fierce Battle for Over 30 Days Inflicts Over 10,000 Casualties on Invading Troops
    Our Army, Filled with Resentment, Withdraws from Sipingjie
    Transfers to Designated Positions in the Suburbs to Continue Resolute Resistance
    [Xinhua News Agency, Gongzhuling, 21st] From the Sipingjie front, after more than thirty days of intense warfare, the Northeast People's Army – the Democratic Allied Army, inflicted severe losses on the invading Kuomintang army, with over ten thousand casualties. As its mission had been accomplished, it systematically withdrew from Sipingjie on the 20th, transferring to new positions to continue resolute resistance. Heavy fighting is currently still underway near Sipingjie. The Battle of Sipingjie began on the 16th of last month. The Kuomintang army, with the New First Army and the Seventy-first Army as its main forces, totaling seven divisions, launched fierce attacks for more than ten days, suffering repeated setbacks and heavy casualties. The Kuomintang then transferred the main force of the New Sixth Army, totaling three divisions, from the Benxi area to the Sipingjie front to attack, and used American-made aircraft and tanks for intense bombing. Many houses in the city were destroyed, and civilians suffered heavy losses. Before retreating, the Democratic Allied Army inflicted effective blows on the invading troops. On the 17th and 18th, the Kuomintang army suffered thousands of casualties. The Battle of Sipingjie demonstrated the unparalleled heroism of the People's Army, thwarting the reactionaries' operational plan to capture Sipingjie before April 2nd. It has its glorious significance in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation! The people of Northeast China and the Democratic Allied Army will continue to resolutely resist with the heroic spirit of defending Sipingjie!
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 21st] At 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, after bombing Sipingjie and the Eight-Sided City positions, seven Kuomintang aircraft dropped two wooden model aircraft over the sky more than ten li south of Lishu County. The wooden aircraft was silver-gray, with a wingspan of one meter and a body length of two Chinese feet. It was a scaled-down model of a four-engine heavy bomber, weighing seven jin. The tips of both wings were painted with two red five-pointed stars. One of the wooden aircraft landed on the Democratic Allied Army's position and is now preserved at the Democratic Allied Army headquarters for submission to the executive group as evidence. This move by the Kuomintang authorities is an old trick of framing and attempting to fabricate slanderous materials for propaganda organs after dropping the small wooden aircraft and taking photos back.

　　中国人民解放史的光辉一页
    血战卅余日毙伤进犯军万余
    我军衔愤撤离四平街
    转至郊外预定阵地继续坚强抗击
    【新华社公主岭二十一日电】四平街前线，经过三十余天的激烈战争，东北人民军队——民主联军，给予进犯之国民党军以万人严重损失后，因任务业已达成，即于二十日有计划的撤离四平街，转移至新阵地，继续坚强抗击，现激战仍在四平街附近进行中。按四平街保卫战，开始于上月十六日，国民党军以新一军及七十一军为主力，共七个师，经过十多天的强攻，连遭顿挫，伤亡甚大。国方乃自本溪方面增调新六军主力等共三个师，开至四平街前线进攻，并借美制飞机坦克猛烈轰击，城内房屋多被炸毁，平民损失甚重。民主联军在撤退前，曾予进犯军以有效打击，十七十八两日国民党军伤亡千人，四平街保卫战表现了人民军队的无比英勇，粉碎了反动派限令四月二日以前攻占四平街的作战计划，它在中国人民解放史上，有其光辉意义！东北人民与民主联军，将以保卫四平街之英雄精神，继续进行坚决抵抗！
    【新华社长春二十一日电】本月十七日下午二时，国民党飞机七架于轰炸四平街及八面城阵地后，在梨树县城正南十余里上空，投下木制小型飞机两架，该木制机为银灰色，翼长一米，身长二华尺，为四发动机重型轰炸机之缩型，全重七市斤，两翼尖端涂有红五角星两个，该木制机有一架落于民主联军阵地上，现保存于民主联军总部，以便交执行小组作证。国民党当局此举，为栽赃陷害之老法，企图于投放小木机后，摄影带回，造作宣传机关血口喷人之资料。
