　　Kuomintang Troops Collude with Enemy and Puppet Forces, Loudly Proclaiming War Preparations
    Massively Deploying and Repeatedly Invading Our Border Areas
    Over Nine Hundred Attacks of Various Sizes in Three and a Half Months
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 11th] Taking advantage of the Eighth Route Army's faithful execution of the ceasefire order, the Kuomintang troops, colluding with enemy and puppet forces, loudly proclaimed "Ceasefire is preparation for war," "Reorganizing the army is building the army," and "Demobilization is mobilization," and deployed large armies to attack the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. The following is a detailed account of the Kuomintang army's movements and attacks from January 14th to the end of April:
    (1) Deploying Troops and Expanding Fortifications. The newly deployed troops around the border region include the 55th Army, 38th Army, 88th Army, two divisions of the 1st Army, one independent brigade, 27th Army, two divisions each of the 68th Army and 90th Army, and five divisions from Yan Xishan's forces transferred from Datong, Taiyuan, and Xiaoyi: the 37th, 38th, 42nd, 70th, and 71st divisions, totaling twenty-three divisions and one independent brigade. Together with the two divisions of the 40th Army, 32nd Army, 85th Army, 30th Army, and Yan Xishan's 44th, 45th, 48th, 52nd, and 66th divisions, which were stationed around the border region before January 13th, the total comes to thirty-nine divisions and one independent brigade, not including the local Japanese and puppet troops. During the same period, the number of fortifications increased from over two hundred to eight hundred and forty-eight, more than two-thirds of which were built after Order No. 4 of the "Peace" charade.
    (2) Military Offensives to Seize Positions. There were 927 attacks of various sizes on the border region, averaging more than eight per day, including four attacks involving more than 10,000 people, forty-two attacks involving more than 1,000 people, forty-five attacks involving more than 500 people, sixty-seven attacks involving more than 100 people, and the rest involving fewer than 100 people, using a total of no less than 600,000 troops. The following is a breakdown:
    (A) Northern Henan Region: The Kuomintang 90th Army, long stationed in Luoyang, crossed north on January 14th and occupied more than thirty villages and towns in Meng County, including Botou, Shunjian, and Yejiong, establishing bridgehead fortresses in an attempt to coordinate with the Kuomintang forces in Wuzhi and Huojia to attack, open the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, and seize Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Jiaozuo. Kuomintang troops on the Pinghan Railway occupied Balizhuang in Anyang, Dongwanghe, Baogongmiao, and Luohekou in Huixian, Zuo Village, Manliu, and East and West Simen in Jixian, and Guanjia Kiln, Wujiawo, Zhangjiao, Pangjiawo, and Dongzi in Tangyin, attempting to confine the Eighth Route Army to the mountains and use it as an advanced position for attacking north along the Pinghan Railway. (B) Eastern Henan Region: The Kuomintang mobilized nine divisions, totaling more than 90,000 troops, and launched more than eighty attacks of various sizes. At the Xinxiang meeting on April 10th, the Kuomintang reactionaries openly denied the existence of the Eastern Henan Liberated Area, making the situation in the area grave. (C) Northern Longhai Railway Region: The 55th Army, originally in Eastern Henan, illegally entered the Ji-Lu-Yu region in mid-March and successively occupied Sanchunji in Kaocheng, Guozhuang in Changyuan, and Gegang in Dongming. At the meeting, they further demanded the opening of the corridor from Kaocheng to Dongming, attempting to link the anti-communist strongholds in southern Ji-Lu-Yu into one piece as an advance base for attack. In the Western Shandong-Northern Jiangsu region, in late April, the Kuomintang army, with more than 5,000 troops and four aircraft, attacked the Shicheng and Caolou areas, and once occupied the Caolou position. Currently, the fighting in the area has not yet ceased. (D) Along the Baijin Railway: Before the ceasefire order, there was not a single soldier of Yan Xishan's army in this area. On February 4th and March 8th, Yan's side twice mobilized large armies, combining with the 14th Brigade of the Japanese army, totaling more than 20,000 troops, to attack along the Baijin Railway, attempting to seize Shangdang. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, and Yan's army failed in both incursions. (E) Southern Shanxi Region: Yan's army and the Kuomintang army launched 467 attacks, using 99,700 troops. The Eighth Route Army suffered 243 casualties below the regimental commander level, and occupied dozens of villages and towns in the liberated areas, including Sandu Village and Ma Village in Pinglu, Congshan Village and Lujiazhuang in Anyi, Lishuling, Liuhe Village, and Beiren Village in Jishan, and Dongma Village in Jiang County.

　　国民党军结合敌伪高唱备战
    大举调动屡犯我边区
    三个半月大小进攻九百余次
    【新华社邯郸十一日电】国民党军结合敌伪军，高唱“停战就是备战”，“整军就是建军”，“复员就是动员”，乘八路军忠实执行停战命令时机，纷纷调动大军，向晋冀鲁豫边区进攻。现将一月十四日至四月底国方军队调动及进攻情形，分述如下：
    （一）调动军队增修碉堡。新调边区周围部队，计有五五军、三八军、八八军、第一军之两个师、一个独立旅、二七军、六八军九十军各两个师、及由大同、太原、孝义增来之阎锡山军三十七、三十八、四十二、七十、七十一等五个师，共计二十三个师，一个独立旅，连一月十三日前原驻边区周围的四十军两个师、三十二军、八十五军、三十军、及阎锡山之四四、四五、四八、五二、六十六等师，共计三十九个师，一个独立旅，当地日伪军尚不在内。同期内碉堡由二百余个增修至八百四十八个，其中三分之二以上是在和字第四号命令后修筑的。
    （二）军事进攻夺取阵地。对边区大小进攻九二七次，每日平均八次以上，其中万人以上进攻四次，千人以上四十二次，五百人以上四十五次，百人以上六十七次，余为百人以下的进攻，使用兵力不下六十万人。兹分述如下：
    （甲）豫北地区：久驻洛阳之国民党九十军，于一月十四日北渡占我孟县之波头、顺涧、冶戎等三十余村镇，建立桥头堡垒，企图将来配合武陟、获嘉国民党军进攻，打通道清线，夺取博爱、沁阳及焦作。平汉路上国民党军，占我安阳之八里庄、辉县之东王河、包公庙、洛河口，汲县之左庄、漫流、东西寺门，汤阴之关家窑、吴家凹、张角、庞家凹、东子等地，企图将八路军封锁于山地，作为向平汉路北攻的前进阵地。（乙）豫东地区：国民党调集九师之众，共九万余人，大小进攻八十余次。四月十日新乡会议上，国民党反动派更公开否认豫东解放区的存在，该地形势严重。（丙）陇海路北地区：原在豫东之五五军，于三月中旬非法开入冀鲁豫地区，先后占我考城之三春集，长垣之郭庄，东明之葛岗。会议上更提出开放考城至东明走廊的要求，企图将冀鲁豫南部反共据点连成一片，作为进攻时的前进基地。鲁西苏北地区，四月下旬，国民党军以五千余人，飞机四架，向我石城、草楼一带进攻，并一度占我草楼阵地。目前该地战事仍未停止。（丁）白晋沿线：停战令前，此地区无阎军一兵一卒，二月四日与三月八日阎方两次调集大军，结合日军十四旅团，共二万余人，向白晋沿线进攻，企图夺取上党。八路军被迫自卫，阎军两次进犯均未得逞。（戊）晋南地区：阎军及国民党军进攻四六七次，使用兵力九万九千七百余人，八路军伤亡团长以下官兵二百四十三人，侵占解放区平陆之三杜村、马村，安邑之从善村、芦家庄，稷山之李树岭、刘和村、北仁村，绛县之东马村等数十村镇。
