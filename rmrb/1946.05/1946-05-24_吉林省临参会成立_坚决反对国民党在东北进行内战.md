　　Jilin Provincial Temporary Consultative Conference Established
    Resolutely Oppose the Kuomintang's Civil War in the Northeast
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th] Jilin Dispatch: (Delayed) Jilin Province held its first Temporary Consultative Conference on the 5th of last month. Fifty-seven representatives of county councilors and organizations attended, with more than fifty guests and observers present. The councilors spoke enthusiastically, especially regarding how to oppose the reactionaries' offensive in the Northeast and defend the peaceful and democratic new Jilin. Representative Mr. Wen Licheng said: "To build a peaceful and democratic new Northeast, we must thoroughly destroy all the conspiracies of the fascists." Mr. Gao Wenzhi said: "The people of the Northeast only have two paths: life and death. If the Kuomintang reactionaries are allowed to implement autocratic dictatorship in the Northeast, that is the dead end for the people. Only by thoroughly realizing freedom, peace, and democracy can we live." The conference unanimously demanded that the Kuomintang authorities implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and resolutely oppose the civil war in the Northeast. It also demanded the recognition of the Jilin Provincial Government elected by the people of Jilin Province. At the end of the conference, Li Du was elected as the chairman, Xiao Danfeng and Ma De'en as vice-chairmen, and Li Yulin, Lin Na, Yang Yutian, Guan Shanfu, Li Lenian, and Sun Jimin as resident members. Mr. Li Lenian, an elder, happily said: "I have lived for sixty-five years, and only now have I seen peace and democracy in the Northeast. I want to work with everyone to the end, until I die." Mr. Sun Jimin said excitedly: "I was a member of the Tongmenghui who participated in the revolution before the Xinhai Revolution, but only today have I seen the Chinese Communist Party truly create happiness for the people, implement democratic politics, and establish a coalition government. I can no longer stand by and watch!" The five-day conference concluded in a joyful atmosphere.

　　吉林省临参会成立
    坚决反对国民党在东北进行内战
    【新华社长春二十日电】吉林讯：（迟到）吉林省于上月五日，举行首届临时参议会，出席各县参议员及团体代表五十七名，列席来宾及旁听者五十余名。参议员都踊跃发言，特别对于如何反对反动派进攻东北保卫和平民主的新吉林问题，讨论更为热烈。代表温立成先生说：“要建设和平民主的新东北，必须彻底摧毁法西斯的一切阴谋。”高文之先生说：“东北人民只有生与死两条路，如果国民党反动派得以在东北实行专制独裁，那就是人民的死路，只有彻底实现自由和平与民主，才是我们的活路。”大会一致要求国民党当局执行政协决议，坚决反对在东北进行内战；并要求追认经吉林全省人民选出之吉林省政府，大会最后选出李杜为正议长，萧丹峰、马德恩为副议长，李玉麟、林纳、杨雨田、关山复、李乐年、孙继民为驻会委员。李乐年老先生高兴地说：“我活了六十五岁，一直到现在才看到东北有了和平民主，我要和大家一起干到底，干到死。”孙继民先生激动地说：“我是辛亥前参加革命的同盟会员，但到今天我才看到中共真正为人民造幸福；实行民主政治，建立联合政府。我绝不能再观望了。”历时五天的大会，在欢乐的气氛中宣告结束。
