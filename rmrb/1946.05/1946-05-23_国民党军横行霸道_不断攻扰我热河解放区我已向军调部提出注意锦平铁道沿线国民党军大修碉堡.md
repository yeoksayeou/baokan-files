　　Kuomintang Troops Act Tyrannically
    Continuously Attacking and Harassing Our Rehe Liberated Area; I Have Lodged a Protest with the Military Mediation Department Regarding the Large-Scale Construction of Bunkers by Kuomintang Troops Along the Jin-Ping Railway Line
    [New China News Agency, Chengde, 19th] Since the ceasefire order came into effect, the Kuomintang troops that have invaded Rehe have never ceased their military deployments, movements, and attacks for the past four months, and the situation has become even more serious recently. The Headquarters of the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region hereby issues the following statement: Rehe was completely liberated by the Chinese Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army after thirteen years of arduous struggle. In August of last year, a democratic government was established through a people's representative conference, and government orders were implemented throughout the province. At the beginning of January this year, Kuomintang troops unreasonably invaded Rehe. Although the ceasefire order took effect at 24:00 on January 13, due to Chiang Kai-shek's secret order to "seize strategic strongholds," the Kuomintang troops, disregarding good faith, continued to seize key points along the Jin-Quan Line (Jinzhou to Yupingquan) with large numbers of troops. On the dawn of January 14, they occupied Pingquan with two divisions of troops, and the Eighth Route Army painfully yielded. On the 19th, the 2nd Division of the 52nd Army occupied Tianyi Station from Ye Baishou, and two regiments of the 54th Division of the 13th Army attacked southward from Nanshan (the midpoint of the Ye-Chi Railway), joining forces with the 2nd Division to open up the railway line from Ye Baishou to Nanshan. On January 10, the 5th Division of the 94th Army stationed in eastern Hebei also launched a multi-pronged attack from Suizhong towards the southeastern part of Rehe, invading and occupying more than ten towns and cities, including Kuanbang, Yaowangmiao, Jianchang (Lingnan), Mingerdeng, and Boluoshu. On February 6, the 54th Division, which had invaded Tianyi, joined forces with the 4th Division, which had invaded Pingquan, to attack and occupy Huangtuliangzi and Dachuandi, eighty li to the south. At the end of February, the 5th Division of the Kuomintang army, which had invaded Boluoshu, continued to attack Dangba. At the same time, the 4th Division of the Kuomintang army in Pingquan also attacked Xiaosigou. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself and repelled the 5th Division. However, that division did not abide by the Dangba agreement to stay in place, but instead transferred to the Northeast to attack the Democratic Allied Army, and the 4th Division did not withdraw to its original position in Pingquan. From the ceasefire order to March, the Kuomintang army mobilized mechanized forces of more than seven divisions to invade our territory, including Pingquan and its north and south sides (south to Xiaoheyan, north to Huangtuliangzi), more than a hundred li of the railway line north of Yebaishou, and many stations along the Jin-Quan Line. Since April, the illegal actions of the Kuomintang army have become even more egregious. In Chifeng, southeast of Pingquan, Jianchang and other places, incidents of harassment against our positions have never stopped. On April 9, reconnaissance planes openly painted with Kuomintang emblems flew low over Chengde, circling for dozens of minutes. On April 10 and 11, reconnaissance planes circled over Chengde at high altitude again.
    In addition, they are building bunkers on a large scale and carrying out war preparations in Chifeng, southeast of Pingquan, and along the Jin-Ping Railway. At the same time, they are violating the ceasefire agreement and using the railway to transport troops in large numbers. According to investigations, (1) the 5th Division was transferred to the Northeast to fight against the Democratic Allied Army in late last month; (2) the 89th Division (belonging to the 13th Army) was transferred from the Northeast to Chaoyang last month, and the 265th Regiment of that division was transferred to Suizhong on April 10 to attack our local army in western Liaoning. Recently, a part of that division was transferred to Lingyuan; (3) the 195th Division of the 52nd Army attacked Erdaogozi in late February, was transferred to the Northeast on April 15, and participated in the Siping Street battle in late April; (4) on April 13, a cavalry unit was transferred from Lingyuan to Pingquan. The Kuomintang army's large-scale troop movements within Rehe are part of its new civil war deployment on a national scale. We have lodged a protest with the Executive Headquarters and the Executive Group and demanded a response from the Kuomintang side. If these Kuomintang troops disregard the ceasefire agreement, break their promises, move troops arbitrarily, launch wanton attacks, sabotage transportation, forcibly build bunkers, and ignore our protests, if such tyrannical acts are not stopped, then for the sake of peace, democracy, survival, and faithful implementation of the three major agreements, the people of Rehe will ultimately not be able to make endless concessions and abandon their rights. Therefore, the consequences arising from stopping the Kuomintang army's attack should be the sole responsibility of the Kuomintang side.

　　国民党军横行霸道
    不断攻扰我热河解放区我已向军调部提出注意锦平铁道沿线国民党军大修碉堡
    【新华社承德十九日电】侵入热河之国民党军，自停战令生效后，迄今四个月来，从未停止军事部署调动与进攻，近日更见严重。冀热辽军区司令部特发表声明如下：热河经中国共产党及八路军十三年来之苦斗，到去年八月间全部得到解放，十月由人民代表会议产生民主政府，政令通行全省，本年一月初，国民党军无理侵入热河，一月十三日二十四时停战命令虽已发生时效，由于蒋介石密令“抢占战略要点”，国民党军仍不顾信义，继续以大量兵力，抢占锦泉线（锦州玉平泉）各要点，一月十四日拂晓，以两个师兵力占领平泉，八路军忍痛让出。十九日，五十二军第二师由叶柏寿攻占天义车站，十三军五十四师两个团，又由南山（叶赤铁路中点）向南进攻，与第二师会合，打通叶柏寿至南山之铁道线。一月十日，驻冀东之九十四军第五师，复经绥中向热河东南部分途进攻，侵占宽邦、药王庙、建昌（凌南）、明尔登、桲罗树等城镇十余处。二月六日，侵入天义之五十四师，与侵入平泉之第四师会攻，侵占黄土梁子及以南八十里之大川地。二月底，侵入桲罗树之国民党军第五师，继续向党坝进攻，同时平泉之国民党军第四师，亦进攻小寺沟，八路军被迫自卫，将第五师击退，然该师并未遵守党坝协定停驻原地，反而调往东北进攻民主联军，第四师亦并未撤回平泉原阵地。自停战令后至三月间，国民党军先后动用机械化兵力在七个师以上，侵占我之地方，则有平泉及其南北两侧（南至笑河沿，北至黄土梁子）叶柏寿以北百余里之铁道线，及锦泉线上之车站多处。四月以来，国民党军之非法行为更变本加厉，在赤峰东南平泉、建昌各地，向我阵地出扰之事件，从未停止，四月九日又公然以涂国民党徽之侦察机低飞承德上空，盘旋数十分钟，四月十日、十一日，复有侦察机至承德高空盘旋。
    此外，在赤峰东南平泉及锦平铁道沿线，大肆修筑碉堡，进行备战动员，同时则违背停战协定，利用铁路大量运兵，现已调查有据者计：（一）上月下旬第五师调东北与民主联军作战；（二）八十九师（属十三军）上月由东北调朝阳，该师二六五团四月十日又调绥中进攻我辽西地方军，最近该师又有一部调凌源；（三）五十二军一九五师，二月下旬，曾进攻我二道河子，四月十五日，调往东北，四月下旬参加四平街作战；（四）四月十三日又有骑兵一部，由凌源调平泉。国氏党军在热河境内如此大规模调动，是其在全国范围内进行新的内战部署的一部分，我方已向执行部及执行小组提出注意，并要求国民党方面答复，因国民党军这些违背停战协定不顾信义调动军队肆意进攻，破坏交通，强修碉堡，不顾我方抗议之霸道横行，如不加以制止，则为和平为民主为生存为忠实执行三大协定，热河人民终将不能作无底止的退让，而放弃自己之权利，因此为制止国民党军队的进攻而引起的后果，应由国民党方面负完全责任。
