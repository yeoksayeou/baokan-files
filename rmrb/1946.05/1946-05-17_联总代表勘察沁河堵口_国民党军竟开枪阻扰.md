　　UNRRA Representative Surveys Qin River Breach
　　KMT Troops Open Fire to Obstruct
　　[Changzhi, 14th Dispatch] Mr. Bi Kaizhai of UNRRA, accompanied by Mr. Jin Guanglian of the Henan Branch of the Executive Headquarters, arrived in Wuzhi County, northern Henan, at the end of last month. Accompanied by Deputy County Magistrate Gong, they went to Donghongqiao on the south bank of the Qin River to survey the breach-closing project of the Qin River. Unexpectedly, KMT troops in the bunkers across the river deliberately obstructed them and opened fire, making it impossible to carry out the survey work. Both Mr. Bi and Mr. Jin expressed surprise at this. It is reported that before the Qin River changed its course, it flowed eastward from Donghongqiao, turning south at the city of Wuzhi County and flowing into the Yellow River. In June 1943, Zhang Jingzhong, the notoriously infamous KMT County Magistrate, and Meng Aowu, the district chief, in order to irrigate the vast land they had seized from the people, disregarded the people's lives and deaths and dug open the Qin River levee between Donghongqiao and Wuchekou. As a result, the Qin River changed its course from Donghongqiao to the southeast, flowing into the Yellow River in a new riverbed ten li wide and twenty li long, flooding more than seventy villages and more than two thousand hectares of fertile land, causing an unprecedented catastrophe for the people of Wuzhi. Last autumn, after our army liberated the entire territory of Wuzhi, the democratic government immediately planned to close the breach and return the Qin River to its old course. Subsequently, due to the KMT's attack and occupation of the county seat, this project was suspended. On the 24th of last month, the county council of the county discussed the issue of river management. Because the project was huge and could not be completed by the manpower of one county, it was decided to request assistance from UNRRA. Mr. Bi and Mr. Le came at the invitation of the council.

　　联总代表勘察沁河堵口
    国民党军竟开枪阻扰
    【长治十四日电】联总毕开斋先生偕行总河南分署靳广濂先生，于上月底抵豫北武陟县，由巩副县长陪同赴沁河南岸东虹桥，勘察沁河决口的堵口工程，不料隔河碉堡中之国民党军，蓄意阻扰，竟开枪射击，致勘察工作，无法进行。毕靳二先生，对此均表惊异。按沁河改道前系由东虹桥东流，至武陟县城始南折流入黄河。民国三十二年六月，臭名远扬之国特县长张敬忠、区长孟鳌吾，因欲灌溉其强占人民的广大土地，竟不顾人民死活，在东虹桥与五车口间掘开沁河河堤，沁河乃改道由东虹桥折向东南，流成一条十里宽二十里长的新河床，注入黄河，计淹没村庄七十余处，良田二千余顷，造成武陟人民空前的浩劫。去秋我军解放武陟全境后，民主政府即行计划堵口，使沁河归故。旋因国民党进攻侵占县城，此项工程乃因而搁置，上月二十四日，该县县议会上，讨论治河问题，因工程浩大，非一县人力所能完成，乃决定请求善后救济总医给予援助，毕、勒两先生此次即系应邀而来。
