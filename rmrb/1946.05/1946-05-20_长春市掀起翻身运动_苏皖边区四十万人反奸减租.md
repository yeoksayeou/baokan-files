　　【Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 17th】 The laboring people of Changchun City are launching an emancipation movement. Since the establishment of the democratic government, the city has been divided into eight administrative districts: Fushima, Changchun, Dongrong, Heshun, Kuancheng, Shuntian, and Datong, and eight work teams have been organized to carry out work. On April 30, citizens of the Jilin sub-district of the Heshun district first reasoned and settled accounts with nine distribution stores, including Dezengsheng and Juxingtai, and calculated a total of over 2 million yuan in embezzled cash. On May 1, citizens of the Balibao sub-district of the Dongrong district held a meeting to distribute enemy and puppet lands, estimating that each person would receive at least one to two mu of land. On May 7, citizens of the Yoshino sub-district of the Fushima district, after public discussion, distributed 29 houses of the enemy to 29 families. Citizens residing in the city, and workers in various factories, are also actively engaged in liquidation. The Changchun Tobacco Company calculated a total of 50 large boxes of cigarettes, worth 650,000 yuan, which were all handed over to the workers. All workers of the Changchun Transportation Company raised 42 cases of corruption by the past "Labor Union Director" Dai E'dian and others, and 17 liquidation committee members have now been selected to carry out the work.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Huai'an, 8th】 In the past month and a half, the 5th sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region has universally launched a movement to punish traitors and combat evil landlords, and reduce rent and interest. Over 400,000 people enthusiastically participated. In the Jiangtai district of Huai'an, over 10,000 people were involved in just 20 days. Thirty-nine traitors were punished one after another, and fourteen heads of evil landlords and bandits, as well as some illegal and stubborn landlords and usurers, were liquidated. The pseudo-bandit Ji Ni Peiying, Shi Ni Xianyuan (puppet Hai'an Zhao Ni Shaozhai's department's quartermaster, lurking in our liberated area, attempting to riot), Sun Ni Kaiqing, and the evil landlord Shen Lanting, etc., were all publicly tried by the people, and punishments such as capital punishment, imprisonment, self-renewal, and compensation for losses were imposed according to the severity of their crimes. The mass movement has its own characteristics in the new and old liberated areas. After launching the movement to punish traitors in the new liberated areas, it promptly shifted to reducing rent and interest. For example, in the Fengjian district of Huai'an, after the initial completion of the work of punishing traitors on April 5, a rent reduction rally was held on the 11th with more than 3,000 tenant farmers. The method of launching the movement in the old liberated areas is to use existing organizations to cultivate activists on a large scale, create typical examples, and promote the overall situation. For example, the Bingzheng district of Jianyang mobilized the masses and began by holding a four-day district-wide meeting of more than 500 peasant households. After clarifying the idea of "who feeds whom," the masses' awareness was raised. After launching a struggle against Gu Jiashan, a landlord who did not reduce rent, it promoted the mass movement in the entire region.

　　长春市掀起翻身运动
    苏皖边区四十万人反奸减租
    【新华社长春十七日电】长春市劳动人民，正掀起翻身运动。自民主政府成立后，即将全市划为敷岛、长春、东荣、和顺、宽城、顺天、大同等八个行政区，并组织八个工作队，进行工作。四月三十日，和顺区吉林分区市民，首先向德增盛、聚兴泰等九家配给店讲理算账，共算出贪污现金贰百余万元。五月一日，东荣区八里堡分区市民，举行分配敌伪土地大会，估计每人至少可分得一亩至二亩土地。五月七日，敷岛区吉野分区市民，经过公议，将敌人二十九间房屋分配给二十九家。市民居住市内，各工厂工人亦积极进行清算。长春烟草公司共清算出香烟五十大箱，价值六十五万元，全部交给工人。长春交通公司全体工人，提出过去“工会主任”戴峨典等贪污案件四十二件，现已选出清算委员十七名，进行工作。
    【新华社淮安八日电】苏皖边区五分区一个半月以来，普遍的展开了惩奸反恶霸减租减息运动，四十余万人热烈参加，淮安蒋台区廿天中，即有一万余群众卷入。先后惩办汉奸三十九名，清算恶霸土匪头子十四名，以及非法顽固地主高利贷者等若干名。伪匪稽逆培瑛、施逆先元（伪海安赵逆少斋部军需，潜伏在我解放区，企图暴动）孙逆开庆、恶霸沈兰亭等，均经人民公审，按罪恶轻重，加以极刑、徒刑、自新、赔偿损失等处分。群众运动在新老解放区，各有特点，在新解放区展开惩奸运动后，及时转入减租减息。如淮安冯间区，在四月五日惩奸工作初步结束后，十一日即召开三千多佃户的退租齐心大会。在老解放区展开运动的方法，是运用已有组织，大规模培养积极分子、创造典型，推动全盘。如建阳秉整区发动群众，开始即开四天全区五百多个农佃户大会，弄通了“谁养活谁”思想之后，群众觉悟性提高了，经展开对不减租的地主顾甲山的斗争，推动了整个地区的群众运动。
