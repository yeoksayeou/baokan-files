　　Taihang New Liberated Area
    Rent Reduction Reaches Intense Stage
    Intensify Mass Movement Blitz Before Summer Harvest to Ensure Implementation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changzhi, 13th] The rent reduction movement in the new areas of Taihang counties has reached its most intense stage. The one month from now until the wheat harvest will be a month of concentrated effort to mobilize the masses. The county councils that recently concluded in various counties all have resolutions to "swiftly implement the rent reduction decree." The Anyang County Party Committee also recently issued a call stating: "The movement urgently needs to deepen and strive for balance; we must complete this arduous task before the wheat harvest." Xiuwu, on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway line, is even more intense. In late last month, when the county held an expanded meeting of cadres and rent reduction activists, only thirteen villages in the county had reduced rents, and nineteen villages were deliberating. However, after reviewing the cadres' neglect of rent reduction and the "no hurry, take it slow" mentality, it was decided that rent reduction must be implemented before the wheat harvest. Now, one-third of the villages in the county have been drawn into the rent reduction movement. Tangyin, on the west side of the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan, has also seen the land reform movement expand from points to the entire area after the county's activist meeting in late last month. In the Jinzhong area, Shouyang and Qi County are using the "support from above to take the lead" approach to make the mass movement universal throughout the county. In the Jindong New District of Heshun, the mass movement has developed rapidly and has now shifted to a large-scale production movement, but at the same time, investigation and reduction of rents continues. In Nanliyang Village in the county, the recent accounting of the evil landlord Jiao's accounts greatly encouraged the masses' production enthusiasm. Neiqiu in western Hebei interrupted the mass movement after shifting to production; the masses' production enthusiasm was very low because they had not completely turned over. It was recently decided to re-launch the movement during the production movement, breaking all the stubborn landlords' attempts to delay and reverse the decisions.

　　太行新解放区
    减租已至紧张阶段
    夏收前加紧群运突击，以求贯彻。
    【新华社长治十三日电】太行各县新区的减租运动，已至最紧张阶段；从现在到麦收的一个月中，将是半年来发动群众的突击月，各县最近先后闭幕的县议会，均有“迅速贯彻减租法令”的决议。安阳县委亦于最近发出号召称：“运动急须走向深入，并争取平衡，麦收前要完成这艰巨任务”。道清线上的修武，则更为紧张，上月下旬该县开扩干与减租积极分子大会时，全县才有十三村减了租，十九村在酝酿，但在检讨了干部忽视减租和“不着急慢慢来”的思想后，决定在麦收前必须贯彻减租，现在全县已有三分之一的村庄卷入减租运动。豫北平汉西侧的汤阴，在上月下旬全县积极分子大会后，翻身运动亦已由点推向了面的开展。晋中地区的寿阳、祁县，则正运用“自上而下撑腰作主”的放手方针，使群运普及全县。晋东和顺新区，群运发展较快，现已转入大生产运动，但同时仍在继续查减。该县南李阳村，最近算了恶霸地主焦某的帐后，大大鼓励了群众的生产情绪。冀西内邱于转入生产后，群运即告中断；群众因未彻底翻身，生产情绪甚低；最近决定在生产运动中重新发动，打破一切顽固地主的拖延与翻案企图。
