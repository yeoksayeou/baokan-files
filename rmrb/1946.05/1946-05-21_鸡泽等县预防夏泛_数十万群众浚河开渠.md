　　Chicken Foot and Other Counties Prevent Summer Floods
    Hundreds of Thousands of People Dredge Rivers and Open Canals
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan News] In southern Hebei, hundreds of thousands of people in Chicken Foot (Jize), Jiangping, Wuyi, Hengshui, Nangong, Yongnian and other counties are actively dredging rivers, opening canals, and building water conservancy projects to solve the long-unresolved summer flooding problem in the area and substantially increase production. Since the beginning of spring, the area has established two river affairs bureaus, and 32 counties have established water affairs committees. The administrative office has also distributed 7,100,000 catties of grain and 1,340,000 yuan in Hebei currency for river dredging. The Chicken Foot River Affairs Committee is currently leading the masses in 169 villages under its jurisdiction to actively dredge the Ox Tail River, the Little Zhang River sluice gate, the Xinglongwan Civilization Ditch, and the Nanxingzhuang sluice gate. Twenty-eight irrigation canals have also been added to both sides of the major rivers, with a total length of more than 32,000 zhang, requiring more than 224,000 workdays. This can irrigate more than 49,000 mu of land. In addition to preventing floods every year, it can also turn the land into paddy fields, increasing grain production by more than 2,450,000 catties. The area of Longping County has many low-lying areas and rivers, among which the Feng River breaches its banks every year, and more than 1,000 hectares of fertile land along the river are often affected by disasters. On the 28th of last month, the democratic government led 20,000 people along the river to dredge a section of the silted riverbed of the Feng River from Beiwuding to Zhangjiakou Bridge, totaling more than 4,500 zhang, which took eight days to complete. Thousands of hectares of wheat fields along the river can be harvested without worry. In Wuyi County, more than 20 villages, including Zida and Antuo, have terrain like a basin. Every summer and autumn, tens of thousands of mu of fertile land accumulate water that cannot be drained. There is no hope of harvesting in the summer, and autumn plowing cannot be planted in time. Farmers suffering from water established a canal opening committee under the leadership of the democratic government, dividing the north and south canals, which are more than 20 li long, so that the water flows directly into the river. The two canals were completed at the end of last month, and from then on, the farmers in more than 20 villages will be free from the worry of floods. During the river dredging, government cadres took the lead from top to bottom, dredging with the masses. Xu, the district chief of Linqing, personally jumped into the water while leading the river opening, scooping water and digging mud. This exemplary action powerfully encouraged the river-repairing masses, and hundreds of thousands of people launched a heated competition, so that every scheduled project could be completed ahead of schedule. In other counties, such as Hengshui, Nangong, and Yongnian, the masses are also enthusiastically dredging rivers and opening canals.

　　鸡泽等县预防夏泛
    数十万群众浚河开渠
    【新华社邯郸讯】冀南鸡泽、降平、武邑、衡水、南宫、永年等县数十万群众，现正积极浚河开渠，兴修水利，以解决该区历年未曾解决的夏季水泛问题，以大量增加生产。该区入春以来，即成立两个河务局，三十二县成立水务委员会，行署并发粮费七百一十万斤，冀钞一百三十四万元，作为浚河之用。鸡泽河务委员会，现正领导县属一百六十九村群众，积极赶浚牛尾河，小漳河水闸，兴隆湾文明沟，与南兴庄水闸。各大河流两岸，亦增开浇地渠二十八条，全长三万二千余丈，费工二十二万四千余工，可浇地四万九千余亩，每年除免水灾外，还能将地变成水田，增产二百四十五万余斤粮食。该区隆平县境，更是洼地多河，其中沣河年年决口，沿岸千余顷良田，常遭灾害。上月二十八日，民主政府遂领导沿岸两万群众，浚通该河北吴町至张家口桥一段淤塞的河床，共达四千五百余丈，历时八天，全告完成。沿岸千顷麦田，当可丰收无虑。武邑县内之紫搭安驼等二十余村，地势如盆，每年夏秋之季，万亩良田，积水不泄，夏季既无望收割，秋耕亦不能适时下种，为水所苦的农民，在民主政府领导下，成立了开渠委员会，分开南北两道水渠，长达二十余里，使水直入大河，该两渠于上月底，已全部竣工，从此二十余村的农民，即可免除水泛之忧。在浚河中，政权干部更是自上而下同群众一起开浚，临清徐区长在领导开河中，亲自跳到水里，一面淘水一面挖泥，这种模范行动，有力的鼓舞了修河群众，数十万人民，遂亦展开了热火朝天的竞赛，使每一预定的工程，都能提早的完成。其他如衡水、南宫、永年等县群众，浚河开渠，亦在热烈进行。
