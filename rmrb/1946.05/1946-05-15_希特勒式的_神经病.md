　　Hitler-style "Neurosis"
    I remember that at the beginning of the Second European War, before Hitler advanced into any country, he would invariably give a speech: saying how his "sacred" Germanic nation had been insulted and slaughtered there, which he could not bear, and he vowed to eliminate these "bandits"... Then the cannons roared, tanks and planes poured in, hanging the corpses of anti-fascist people all over the lampposts on the streets!
    This cruel massacre by Hitler shocked the so-called civilized Europeans and Americans; therefore, for a time, many articles by reporters appeared, using various materials to prove that Hitler was "neurotic." It seemed that without this, it would be impossible to understand this executioner who used all his strength in the twentieth century to carry out human genocide! Later, it seemed that no conclusion was reached.
    Looking back at China, this point is still very advanced; no one has yet come out to shout that our Chinese-style fascist bosses are also neurotic. Although this secret service chief, since betraying the revolution and slaughtering the people, his methods and records are no less than those of his ancestors, and even surpass them.
    However, he wears a long robe and a cloak, originally a "Sino-Western" antique, taking the opportunity of the War of Resistance, he unexpectedly achieved victory, which added some luster to his appearance. He is also a lackey, so he will not offend the foreign masters – as for domestic affairs, China has a vast land and a large population, and it is not surprising that some old people die. Therefore, foreign journalists have not bothered to study whether he also has a nervous breakdown.
    We know that he is not neurotic.
    Looking back a long way, this secret service chief used to use words like "supreme" and "sacred" to give a speech, and then there would be a bloody battle, slaughtering tens of millions of people. Looking at the recent past, he just declared that he would implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implement democracy, and immediately called on the whole country to fight each other, from the accompanying capital to the capital, to the ancient capital, to Shanghai, Guangzhou... For the unarmed people, there was a murderous aura! Beating Political Consultative Conference representatives, beating newspaper offices, beating schools; students beat students, beat professors; Qingdao female students opposed being labeled with "puppet" titles and opposed screening and were beaten to death, Shanghai Jiaotong University students were beaten for dissuading the army from moving furniture: traditionally, demonstrations are beaten, this time Chengdu Yenching University students were beaten for not wanting to demonstrate; in the Shanghai strike wave, there were many news reports of managers personally taking action and beating people...
    Recently, those who fought bloody battles for eight years to liberate the territory from the enemy are easily denounced as "bandits"; and they have hindered his "sacred," "supreme," whatever. What exactly have you hindered that is "sacred" and "supreme"? You lost the Northeast for fourteen years with the three words of non-resistance, not allowing the people to commemorate, not allowing the people to discuss. After the War of Resistance, you openly declared that restoring the situation before the July 7th Incident would be peaceful, clearly handing over the Northeast again, but now you want to swear to "defend with iron and blood" and "spare no sacrifice" – it really makes people suspicious; could it be that some "sacred" and "supreme" alliance of yours has been destroyed by us?
    From this, it can be seen that beating is legal, nationwide, planned, and step-by-step; but before beating, one must talk nonsense to find an excuse to cover it up. This is a kind of shameless rogue tactic before a fascist attack. Whether it is Hitler or the Chinese fascist head, in Southern dialect it is called "fā shénjīng" (going crazy), but they are not really neurotic!
    A rare piece of news found in an old newspaper is enough to prove it.
    The Shanghai newspaper of March 16 published the following news: After the strike at the New Asia Clothing Company caused a conflict: "Manager Zhu Xingeng suddenly rushed into the accounting counter, raised an inkstone, and broke the glass himself, and poured a bottle of blue ink on his face, and then blew the police whistle to call the police, trying to falsely accuse the workers. At that time, the audience gathered, but the blue ink was all smeared on the boss's hands and face, and there was not a drop on the workers. At this point, Zhu admitted without being beaten that it was all done by one person, and claimed to have a history of mental illness."
    So that's how it is! Doesn't the small thug paint a wonderful portrait for the big thug? There will always be such a day: this executioner will run bloodily in front of the people to confess without being beaten! Although he does not "have a history of mental illness," he does suffer from Hitler-style "neurosis." This fascist bellicose disease will bury him just like burying Hitler!

### 希特勒式的“神经病”

　　希特勒式的“神经病”
    我记得，第二次欧战爆发之初，希特勒每在进兵那一国之前，向例要先发一通演讲：说他那“神圣”的日耳曼民族在那里如何遭受了污辱、残杀，这是他不忍受的，他发誓要消灭这些“匪徒”……于是炮声响了，坦克飞机一涌而进，将反法西斯人民的尸体悬遍了大街上的电线杆子！
    这希特勒残酷的屠杀，曾使得号称文明的欧美人大为震骇；因之，一时曾出现了不少记者的文章，用种种材料来证明希特勒是“神经病”。似乎不如此，则无法理解，这个在二十世纪用尽一切力量来进行人类大屠杀的刽子手！以后，似乎没有听到有什么结论。
    回头看看我们中国，这一点还很进步；还没有人出来叫唤说，我们中国式的法西斯头子也有神经病。虽然这个特务头子自从叛变革命屠杀人民以来，其手段，其纪录绝不亚于他祖宗，甚至有过之无不及。
    不过，他身穿长袍，外披大氅，原是个“中西合璧”的古董，投抗战之机，居然胜利，多少给外表添了些光彩，却又是一个奴才，倒底还不会侵犯到洋老子头上去——至于对内，中国地广人众，死些老百姓，早已不足为奇了，——因此还不曾劳外国记者来研究他是否也有神经病。
    我们是知道他没有神经病的。
    往远看，这个特务头子过去也常常曾经用“至上”“神圣”啊这一类字眼来发表一通演说，然后就是一场血战，屠杀了上千万人民。往近看，刚刚声明了要执行政协决议，要实行民主，紧接着就又号召全国大打出手，从陪都到首都、到故都、到上海、广州……对于无寸铁的人民，一片杀气腾腾！打政协代表，打报馆，打学校；学校的学生打学生，打教授；青岛女学生反对带“伪”字头衔，反对甄别而被打杀，上海交大学生为劝阻军队不运走家具而挨打：向来游行都是挨打的，这次成都燕大学生不愿游行也被打；上海罢工热潮中，有不少经理亲自出马大打出手的新闻……。
    最近，对八年浴血奋斗从敌人手里解放国土的人，动不动斥为“匪徒”；又妨碍了他的“神圣的”“至上的”什么什么。倒底妨碍了你“神圣的”“至上的”什么呢？你以不抵抗三字把东北丢了十四年，不准人民纪念，不准人民议论。抗战以后，还公开声明恢复七七事变前之情况即可和平，明明又把东北拱手相让，现在却要誓“铁血保卫”，“不惜任何牺牲”了——真叫人怀疑；莫非你有个什么“圣神的”“至上的”同盟被我们破坏了么？
    由此可见，打是合法的，全国性的，有计划有步骤的；不过打之前，要胡言乱语找个借口来掩饰一下，这是法西斯进攻前的一种无耻的流氓手段。无论希特勒也好，中国法西斯头子也好，用一句南方话说叫作“发神经”却并非真有神经病也！
    从旧报中偶得一珍闻，则更足以证明。
    三月十六的上海报纸发表这样一条新闻：新亚服装公司因为罢工引起冲突后：“经理竺新庚突然狂奔入账房柜台举砚将玻璃自行击破，并将蓝墨水一瓶倒翻涂在自己脸上，随即大吹警笛，召来岗警，企图诬控职工。当时观众云集，惟蓝墨水全涂在老板手脸，职工身上并无点滴。至此竺某不打自招，承认全系一人所为，并称素有神经病云。”
    原来如此！小打手不亦为大打手画出一幅绝妙的写照么？将来也总会有这么一天：要这个刽子手血淋淋的跑在人民面前来不打自招的！虽然他并不“素有神经病”，但他确实又害的是希特勒式的“神经病”，这种法西斯好战的病症，将和埋葬希特勒一样的埋葬了他！
