　　【Xinhua News Agency, Xingtai】After deepening the anti-traitor, rent reduction, and capital increase movements, the masses of Xingtai City are now actively organizing cooperative production with the benefits they have obtained. Currently, in streets such as Malu Street, Yangshi Street, Dingshi Street, and Mashi Street in the city, eight cooperatives of various industries have been organized, with capital reaching 1,497,000 yuan. (Among them, 1,370,000 yuan is from the fruits of struggle as shares, 38,000 yuan from mass shareholding, and 80,000 yuan from democratic government loans.) In half a month, the eight cooperatives organized 420 women in the city for spinning and weaving. Seventy-nine small vendors received low-interest sales loans from the cooperatives, and twenty-five rickshaw pullers were organized for transportation. In just fifteen days, profits of over 80,000 yuan were obtained. The production enthusiasm of the masses in each street is even higher. In the process of organizing production with the fruits of struggle, the following initial experiences have been gained: (1) Organizing cooperative production with the fruits of victory must be based on the masses' conscious willingness to consolidate it. After the Yangshi Street People's Association struggled against Miao Yongyi, the leadership distributed the fruits to the masses and, based on their enthusiasm, guided them to organize production. After ideological clearance, the masses voluntarily contributed shares and opened a coal factory. In this type of cooperative production, everyone feels like they are the masters, and their production enthusiasm is a hundred times higher. Conversely, the Malu Street coal factory failed because the fruits of the struggle were not contributed by the masses voluntarily, and the masses were not interested in the cooperative. (2) In terms of cooperative business policies, it should be combined with the vital interests of the masses, such as the support of various factories for women's spinning and weaving, and the assistance to small vendors and rickshaw pullers, truly achieving mutual benefit for both the public and private sectors. The cause of cooperative production will be further consolidated and expanded. (3) In the leadership of cooperative production factories, it is advisable to adopt a piece-rate wage system, with proportional wage increases for exceeding production quotas, so that production efficiency can be rapidly improved.

　　邢台市深入群运后
    群众组织合作生产
    八个合作社组织了四百纺妇
    【新华社邢台讯】经过深入反奸灭租增资后的邢台市群众，现正以自己获得的利益，积极组织合作生产。该市马路街、羊市街、靛市街、马市街等街，目前已组织起八个各业合作社，资金达一百四十九万七千余元。（其中斗争果实入股一百三十七万元，群众入股三万八千元，民主政府贷款八万元）八个合作社在半月中，组织了市内妇女四百二十人进行纺织，七十九个小商贩，得到合作社的低利运销贷款，二十五个小车工人被组织运输。仅十五天中，即获利八万余元。各街群众，生产情绪，遂更高涨，在将斗争果实组织生产过程中，已初步获得如下经验：（一）将胜利果实组织合作生产，必须群众自觉自愿才能巩固。羊市街平民会斗争苗永衣后，领导上即将果实分配给群众，在群众的热情基础上，引导他们组织起来进行生产，经过思想打通后，再由群众自愿入股，开办了煤厂。这样的合作生产，大家认为自己是主人，生产积极性即百倍高涨。反之马路街煤厂，由于斗争果实不是经过群众自愿的入股，群众对合作社不感兴趣，结果生产失败了。（二）合作营业方针上，应与群众切身利益相结合，如各厂对妇女纺织的扶植，对小贩小车工人的帮助，真正达到了公私两利，合作生产的事业，也就更加巩固与扩大了。（三）合作生产的工厂领导上，宜采取按件工资制，超过的产量按比例增资，这样才能使生产效率飞速提高。
