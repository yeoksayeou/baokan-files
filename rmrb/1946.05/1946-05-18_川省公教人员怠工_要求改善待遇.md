　　Sichuan Public Sector Employees' Work-to-Rule Action
    Demands Improved Treatment
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Public sector employees in Sichuan Province are experiencing severe hardship. The treatment of county-level public sector employees is generally inferior to that of laborers in the central organs of the Kuomintang. Currently, county-level civil servants in various counties have jointly established a "Survival Alliance." The Chongqing Municipal Secondary School Faculty and Staff Association also recently held a representative conference, resolving to once again demand improved treatment from the authorities. If this does not yield results, they have decided to hold a second strike within days. All civil servants in Tongliang County have been implementing a work-to-rule action since the 1st of this month, which remains unresolved. Government employees and primary school teachers in Chengdu, as well as county-level public sector employees in Jiang'an County, have also expressed similar sentiments, demanding improved treatment.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] In order to expand the civil war, the Kuomintang authorities are frantically increasing the issuance of currency. According to financial circles, the monthly amount is at least 20 million yuan or more, and they are rushing to print a large number of 2,500 yuan denomination banknotes, which will soon be officially circulated.

　　川省公教人员怠工
    要求改善待遇
    【新华社渝十五日电】川省公教人员生活困苦，一般县级公教人员待遇不及国民党中央机关的工役，现各县县级公务员已联合成立“生存同盟”。渝市中等学校教职员联谊会也于最近举行代表大会，决定再向当局要求改善待遇，如仍不获结果，决于日内举行第二次罢教。铜梁县全体公务人员，已于本月一日起实行怠工，迄未解决。成都市政府职员、小学教员及江安县县级公教人员，也纷纷表示同样态度，要求改善待遇。
    【新华社渝十五日电】国民党当局为扩大内战，正疯狂增发通货，据金融界悉：每月至少在两千万元以上，并正赶印大批二千五百元票面之法币，不久即可正式流通。
