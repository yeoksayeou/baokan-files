　　Chairman Mao's Photograph
    A Story That Happened at ×× Elementary School in Beiping

    One day, Yang Xiaoyu was hunched over his small desk when he suddenly asked his father, "Dad! What kind of ideology do you have?"
    "What kind of ideology do you think I have?" his father asked with a smile, stroking the child's soft hair.
    He hesitated for a moment, then opened his innocent eyes wide and said, "I think you have Communist ideology."
    "No, why do you say I have Communist ideology?"
    "Humph! I know," Yang Xiaoyu said triumphantly, pursing his lips. He fiddled with a textbook and said with a smile, "The other day when you were talking to that uncle, I heard you talking about Chairman Mao, saying how great Chairman Mao is. People in the Kuomintang only talk about Chairman Chiang, only Communists talk about Chairman Mao, right?"
    Another day, Yang Xiaoyu was picking up his schoolbag to go to school when he suddenly discovered a "Jin-Cha-Ji Pictorial" behind his father's bookshelf. It had a huge picture of Chairman Mao printed on it. He looked at it again and again, thinking, "It would be good for my classmates to see Chairman Mao too." So he folded the pictorial, stuffed it into his schoolbag, and skipped and jumped to school.
    The classroom was still empty, quiet. Xiaoyu sat down and took out the pictorial, spreading it on the desk. He lowered his head, studying Chairman Mao's eyebrows, nose, lips, and eyes over and over. He thought, "Truly a great man!"
    Gradually, more and more classmates arrived, and everyone crowded around, four or five pairs of round eyes curiously focused on Chairman Mao's face.
    "Who is it?" one child asked.
    "It's Chairman Mao! It's the great Chairman Mao!" Yang Xiaoyu immediately straightened his chest and raised his hand to his cap brim: "Salute! Salute to Chairman Mao!"
    "Salute!" a child echoed, raising his hand.
    "Salute!" all the children echoed, straightening their backs and raising their hands to their cap brims.
    "Salute, Chairman Mao!"
    "Great Chairman Mao, I salute you!"
    "Salute!" "Sal..." "..." Everyone shouted excitedly, raising their hands to their cap brims, lowering them, and raising them again: "Salute!" "Chairman Mao, salute!"
    "What's all the noise? Yang Xiaoyu," Mr. Kang poked his head out of the teacher's office window, "Come here! Xiaoyu, come here for a moment!"
    Everyone quieted down. Yang Xiaoyu stuck out his tongue and walked towards Mr. Kang's room.
    "Xiaoyu, what are you leading everyone to shout about again?"
    "I led everyone to salute Chairman Mao!"
    Mr. Kang smiled with satisfaction, touched Xiaoyu's head, and said, "You really are a good child!...!..."

　　毛主席的像片
    发生在北平××小学的故事
    一天，杨小玉伏在小书桌上，忽然问他父亲说：“爸爸！你是什么思想？”
    “你说我是什么思想呢？”父亲摸着孩子的柔发，微笑着反问。
    他迟疑了一会，睁大天真的眼睛说：“我说你是共产党思想。”
    “不，你怎么说我是共产党思想呢？”
    “哼！我知道。”杨小玉得意的抿着嘴，一面拨弄着一本教科书，微笑说：“那天你跟那个伯伯谈话时，我听得你们谈毛主席，说毛主席怎样伟大。人家国民党都谈蒋主席，只有共产党才谈毛主席呀，是吧？”
    又一天，杨小玉正提起书包准备上学去，忽然在他父亲的书架背后，发现了一张“晋察冀画报”，那上面印有一巨幅毛主席的像片，他看了又看，心想：“应该让同学们都看看毛主席才好。于是他把画报一折塞入书包，跳呀跳的跑向学校去。
    课室里还没一个人，静悄悄的。小玉坐下来，把画报掏出来，摊在桌子上。他埋下头，来回揣摩着毛主席的眉毛，鼻子，嘴唇和眼睛，他想：“真是伟大的人！”
    渐渐地，小同学来多了，大家都围上来，四五双圆滚滚的眼睛，都奇怪地集中在毛主席的脸上。
    “谁呀？”一个孩子问道。
    “是毛主席！是伟大的毛主席！”杨小玉立即挺直胸膛，把手举到帽沿上：“敬礼！向毛主席敬礼！”
    “敬礼！”一个孩子应和着，举起手。
    “敬礼！”所有的孩子们应和着，都挺直腰干，把手举到帽沿上。
    “敬礼，毛主席！”
    “伟大的毛主席，我向你敬礼！”
    “敬礼！”“敬……”“……”大家兴奋地喧嚷着，都将手举到帽沿上，放下去，又举起来：“敬礼！”“毛主席，敬礼！”
    “吵什么呀？杨小玉，”康先生在教员室的窗口上探出头来，“你来！小玉，你到我这里来一下！”
    大家沉静了。杨小玉吐了吐舌头，走向康先生房子里去。
    “小玉，你又领大家嚷什么呢？”
    “我领大家向毛主席敬礼！”
    康先生满意一笑，摸着小玉的头顶说：“你真是个好孩子！……！……”
