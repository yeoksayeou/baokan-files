　　【Report from Heze by this newspaper】In order to demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately halt the Garden Mouth blockage project and promptly carry out river dredging and embankment restoration to prevent floods from submerging the lives and property of seven million people in the seventeen counties along the old course of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, Mr. Pei Yuming, Mr. Gu Zihui, and Mr. Hu Yuping were specially selected to form a petition delegation to go to Nanjing to petition. The delegation departed yesterday (the 22nd) for Kaifeng. On the evening of the 21st, people from all walks of life in Heze City held a rally at the Dazhong Theater to send off the petition delegation. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely indignant. Citizens from all walks of life unanimously expressed their vow to oppose the continued conspiracy to block the river mouth and firmly demanded that the Kuomintang authorities implement the Heze Agreement, first complete the river dredging and embankment restoration project, and are willing to back up the petition delegation with actual strength and action. The two representatives of the petition delegation, Pei and Gu, immediately stated that they were determined to complete the task entrusted to them by the seven million people of the seventeen counties with all their strength, and no sacrifice would be spared. Before leaving, the three representatives of the petition delegation made the following remarks to reporters: Mr. Pei Yuming said that the purpose of this petition to Beijing is to demand that the Kuomintang authorities implement the Communist-KMT agreement and immediately stop blocking the river mouth. Only after this requirement is fully answered can other issues be discussed. At the same time, we will also demand that the dikes of the new flooded areas of Henan be repaired before the blockage, to prevent the expansion of the new flooded areas, and to effectively provide relief to the disaster victims in the area.
