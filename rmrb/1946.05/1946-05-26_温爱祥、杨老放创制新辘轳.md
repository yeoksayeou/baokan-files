　　Wen Aixiang and Yang Laofang Invent New Pulley
    [Yongnian News] Wen Aixiang and Yang Laofang from Dongjiangwu Village have successfully invented a new pulley. When they first started researching, many people criticized them for fooling around, but they were not discouraged and continued to study diligently. They knew that the democratic government would reward inventions and improvements to farm tools, so they made a model and sent it to the government for inspection. Our government provided them with spiritual encouragement and loan support, which gave them even greater confidence. At the end of the year, they researched and trial-produced it. After many failures and modifications, they have now successfully created it. In order to promote agricultural tool improvement, our government awarded them 100 catties of millet, which was praised by the masses. The advantages of the new pulley are: 1. For the same water depth, the old pulley needs to be cranked twelve and a half times for the water to come up, while the new pulley only needs to be cranked three and a half times; because the pulley head is larger. 2. Because the new pulley hangs two buckets (the old one has one), when one goes up, the other goes down, and the descending empty bucket acts as a weight; after the water is cranked up, it can automatically pour out without using hands; furthermore, because of the use of shaft bowls and ball bearings, it is light and labor-saving, and can be used by women and children. 3. In terms of efficiency, one new pulley can replace six old ones, equivalent to one waterwheel, but the price is much cheaper than a waterwheel, and it does not require livestock to pull it.

　　温爱祥、杨老放创制新辘轳
    【永年消息】东讲武村温爱祥、杨老放，创制新辘轳已经成功。当其最初研究时，多人评为瞎闹，他俩毫不灰心，仍苦心钻研。他俩知道民主政府奖励发明，改良农具后便制模型送政府验看；我政府给以精神奖励并贷款支持，他俩信心更大。在年关时，他俩便研究试造，经多次的失败与改造，现已创制成功。为提倡农具改良，我政府奖励小米百斤；广大群众莫不啧啧称道。新辘轳的好处：一、同样的水深，旧辘轳井绳搅十二遭半水才上来，新辘轳搅三遭半水就能上来；因为辘轳头大。二、因新辘轳挂两个水斗（旧的是一个），这个上来那个下去，下去的空斗起下坠作用；搅上水来后可以自倒不用手倒；更因用轴碗、滚球之故，所以轻便省力，妇女小孩都可使用。三、在效率上，一架新辘轳可顶旧的六架，相等于一架水车，但价格上比水车贱很多倍，又不用牲口拉。（马克、允谦）
