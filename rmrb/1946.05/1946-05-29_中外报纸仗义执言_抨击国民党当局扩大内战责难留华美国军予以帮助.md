　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th Dispatch] Moscow Today Broadcasting: Chinese and foreign newspapers have commented extensively on the Kuomintang army's military actions in North and Central China. News of continued tension is coming from China. The civil war that started in Manchuria has begun to engulf North and Central China. In Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Hubei, and Henan, the Kuomintang army is constantly attacking the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Chinese Communist Party. Columbia Broadcasting Company's Shanghai correspondent, Ulisa, published a commentary in New York on May 8th, describing the increasing expansion of the Chinese civil war, with the Kuomintang army concentrating its forces to attack the Communist army with the aid of U.S. military transportation.
    Chinese public opinion strongly opposes the reactionaries' expansion of the civil war and the Kuomintang's reorganization of Japanese and puppet troops to attack the basic forces of the Chinese people, using enemy and puppet troops to massacre the Chinese people. The U.S. military headquarters stationed in China openly assists the Kuomintang army. These facts further deepen the people's resentment and cause great anxiety among social figures. Moreover, American newspapers are commenting on this fact, and Kuomintang officials also admit that the United States is assisting the Kuomintang army. Chinese democrats hope to stop military action immediately, while Chinese reactionaries, on the contrary, want to provoke a civil war in Central and North China, creating new dangers of more dangerous and widespread political disputes. Chinese democratic forces strongly oppose foreign accomplices who provoke civil war and demand that the task of stopping military action be implemented accurately and unconditionally in any region of China.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th Dispatch] Moscow News: Red Star newspaper commented that the continued Chinese civil war and the assistance given to the Kuomintang army by the U.S. military headquarters stationed in China have caused great anxiety and unease among Chinese and American social figures. The newspaper reported that after the Soviet army withdrew from Manchuria, the slogan "Why not send the American army home?" appeared on buildings in Shanghai. Many progressive American newspapers have also raised the same question more than once, insisting on stopping interference in China's internal affairs. Not long ago, representatives of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and other mass organizations wrote to the U.S. State Department, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The letter stated: "The presence of U.S. troops in China violates the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs and encourages the Kuomintang to wage civil war." This demand has become more insistent and tenacious recently.

　　中外报纸仗义执言
    抨击国民党当局扩大内战
    责难留华美国军予以帮助
    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科今日广播：中外报纸纷纷评论国民党军在华北、华中的军事行动。从中国传来局势继续紧张的消息，从满洲所开展的内战，开始卷入华北、华中。在江苏、山东、山西、河北、湖北及河南等地，国民党军不断进攻中共领导的八路军和新四军，哥伦比亚广播公司驻沪记者乌里萨，五月八日在纽约发表评论，叙述中国内战日益扩大，国民党军在美军援助运输下，集中自己的力量进攻中共军。
    中国社会舆论极力反对反动派扩大内战，国民党改编日伪军进攻中国人民的基本部队，利用敌伪军屠杀中国人民。驻华美军司令部，公开援助国民党军队，这些事实更加深人民的愤恨并使社会人士感到极大的不安。而且美国报纸都评论这一事实，国民党官方亦承认美国是援助国民党军队。中国民主派都盼望即刻停止军事行动，而中国反动派恰相反想挑起华中、华北的内战，造更危险更广泛的政治纠纷的新危险。中国民主力量极力反对挑起内战的外国帮凶，要求在中国任何区域，准确地和无条件地执行停止军事行动的任务。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科讯：红星报评中国内战继续进行，以及驻华美军司令部予国民党军以援助，已在中国与美国社会人士间，引起极大焦虑不安。该报报导：当苏军自满洲撤退之后，在上海楼房上即出现了“为何还不打发美军回家？”的标语，美国许多进步报纸，也不只一次提出同一问题，坚持停止干涉中国内政。不久前美国产业工会联合会及其他群众团体代表，曾致函美国务院，要求撤退美军，该函称：“美军驻在中国，违反了不干涉中国内政的政策，并且鼓励国民党进行内战。”这一要求，在最近以来愈加坚持与顽强了。
