　　【New China News Agency, Jinji Luyu General Branch News】A temporary work team from the Henan Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), consisting of Meade (American), Boyde (Canadian), Wang Kejian, and doctors and technicians, ten people in total, arrived in Hua County, the fourth district of Ji-Lu-Yu, on the 23rd, 27th, and 30th of last month, respectively. They worked together with our Yu-Bei Office of the Jinji Luyu Relief Branch for twelve days, returning to Xinxiang on the 5th of this month. The materials brought this time included 4,000 bags of second, third, and fourth-grade flour, 160 packages of clothing, eight boxes of medicine, and 6 million yuan (in legal tender) for fertilizer and seeds. The distribution area this time covered seven counties: Neihuang, Junxian, Yanjin, Weinan, Hua County, Gaoling, and Linzheng. Each county designated one to three centralized locations for distributing flour, with half a bag for every four people and two bags for every eight people. The allocation for fertilizer and seeds was 10 yuan (in legal tender) per mu, with a maximum of five mu per household. Clothing was issued according to different needs and numbered for distribution, while medicine was distributed by medical institutions according to different needs. Regarding future relief work, our Yu-Bei Office put forward four suggestions: (1) Our representatives should participate in the relief efforts of the Henan Relief Branch. (2) The Henan Branch should establish regular contact with us in the future. (3) The principle of material distribution should not only be based on county towns, but should be allocated according to all villages, population, and disaster situation. (4) We request technical assistance. The team agreed with three of these four suggestions, but no agreement was reached on the organizational issue. After the relief work was completed, members of the team visited our liberated areas' factories, hospitals, schools, and rent reduction and interest rate reduction mass meetings in Hua County, Daokou, Puyang, and other places. They expressed admiration for our democratic life and the spirit of hard work and simplicity, especially praising the production mutual aid and rural cooperatives. In addition, the relief work team organized by UNRRA's Li Yade, Hede, and the Henan Branch's He Sihui and four other gentlemen arrived in Meng County on February 25, carrying 700 bags of flour, 143,000 yuan in cash, and five packages of clothing (totaling 400 items, with one to two or three pieces per item). The masses in the disaster areas generally believe that the relief supplies are too meager to compensate for the serious losses suffered by the people of northern Henan who persisted in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines for the past eight years, and who have been repeatedly ravaged by the enemy puppets and Kuomintang troops. Currently, the people in various disaster areas are extending their hands for help, urgently awaiting relief from the trauma suffered over the past eight years.

　　联总救济物资一部先后运到我区发放
    群众认为物资微少，不足弥补八年创伤
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】联合国救济总署行总河南分署之临时工作队美德（美籍）、勃亚得（加籍）、汪克俭及医师、技师等十人，于上月二十三、二十七、三十日先后到达冀鲁豫四分区滑县，与我晋冀鲁豫救济分署豫北办事处，共同进行救济工作，历时十二天，本月五日返回新乡。此次运来物资共计二、三、四等面粉四千袋，衣物一百六十包，药八箱，肥料、种子六百万元（法币），此次发放地为内黄，浚县、延津、卫南、滑县、高陵、临征等七县，每县指定一个至三个集中地点，发放面粉，每四人半袋，八人二袋。肥料、种子款每亩法币十元，每户最多以五亩地计。衣物则根据不同需要编号抽发，药品由医务机关根据不同需要发放。关于今后救济工作，我豫北办事处提出四点意见：（一）河南救济分署救济应有我方代表参加。（二）今后河南分署应与我方建立经常关系。（三）物资分配原则，不应只按县城为准，应按所有村庄，人口及灾情分配。（四）请求在技术上予我们以帮助，该队对于这四项意见，其中三项表示同意，惟组织问题未得协议。救济完毕后，该队人员分别到滑县、道口，濮阳等地参观我解放区工厂、医院、学校及减租减息群众会，对我民主生活，艰苦朴素作风，甚表欣佩，特别对生产互助及农村合作社更表赞同。又联总李亚得，赫德与河南分署何思惠等五先生所组织之救济工作队，曾于二月二十五日抵孟县，携带面粉七百袋，钞票十四万三千元，衣物五包（共计四百号，每号一件至两三件不等），各灾区群众咸认此次救济物资甚少，不能弥补八年来豫北人民坚持敌后抗战，及累遭敌伪及国民党军队摧残的严重损失，现各灾区人民正伸出求助之手，亟待救济八年所受的创伤。
