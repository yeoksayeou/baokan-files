　　American Newspapers Support Marshall's Statement
    Criticize the National Government for Being Too Slow in Purging Reactionaries
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 25th] General Marshall's statement on the 20th regarding ceasing the civil war in the Northeast and clarifying the situation in North China has received support from several newspapers in the eastern United States. According to a US Information Service dispatch from San Francisco on the 23rd, the Washington Post stated: "General Marshall's action is entirely justifiable. No country in the world needs unity and peace more than China. Some reactionaries are delaying the rapid implementation of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's promise to establish a democratic government, and the central government's efforts to purge these reactionaries have been too slow. General Marshall has not abandoned his efforts to promote cooperation between the two sides. However, in terms of peace and unity, only the Chinese people themselves can achieve it." The New York Herald Tribune also held similar views and believed that General Marshall's action "has entered the correct path."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 23rd] Associated Press reported: Harold Milks reported: The continuation of the Chinese civil war has fragmented China's domestic economy. Import and export trade has virtually come to a standstill because merchants dare not transport goods or send purchasing personnel to inland war zones. Shanghai, a mirror of Chinese commerce, the import market is now quite depressed, all warehouses are filled with goods, and unless the Nanjing negotiations achieve a comprehensive agreement to stop the war, Chinese merchants do not expect to resume normal trade in the near future.

　　美国报纸支持马歇尔声明
    指责国民党政府对反动派清除工作过于迟缓
    【新华社延安二十五日电】马歇尔将军二十日关于制止东北内战与澄清华北局势的声明，已获得美国东部若干报纸的声援。如据美新闻处旧金山二十三日讯：华盛顿邮报称：“马歇尔将军此举，实属无可非议，全世界各国需要团结与和平之殷，未有甚于中国者。若干反动分子对迅速执行蒋委员长实现民主政府之诺言，予以延搁，而中央政府对此辈反动分子的清除工作，则进行过于迟缓，对于促使双方合作之努力，马帅迄未放弃。但就和平与团结而言，唯有中国人本身，方能完成之”。纽约先驱论坛报，也有类似意见，并认为马帅此举“已进入正确之路”。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】美联社讯：哈罗德·密克报导：中国内战之继续，肢解了中国国内的经济。出入口贸易，由于商人不敢运货或派采购人员至内地战区，实际上已陷于停顿。为中国商业一面镜子之上海，入口市场现在颇为消沉，所有货栈，均堆满货物，而且除非南京谈判获得全盘协议以停止战争，中国商人预料最近并无恢复正常贸易之望。
