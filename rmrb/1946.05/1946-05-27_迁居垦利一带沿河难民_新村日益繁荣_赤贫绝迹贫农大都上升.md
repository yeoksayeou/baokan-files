    [New China News Agency, Huimin, 24th] Under the support of the democratic government, residents along the Yellow River in the Kenli area are living prosperous lives. Seven thousand one hundred and thirty-four relocated refugee households, totaling thirty-three thousand five hundred and sixty-nine people, have established one hundred and ten new villages. People have transitioned from eating vegetables and chaff to having ample food and clothing. After rent reduction and interest rate reduction, farmers have been actively purchasing land and adding livestock and vehicles. Currently, there are over five hundred head of livestock and more than one hundred and fifty carts in the areas on both sides of the Yellow River. According to incomplete statistics, over 448,000 mu of wasteland has been cultivated. Based on last year's yield of 210 jin per mu, this can produce over 94.11 million jin of grain. Of the 120,000 people in Kenli, 89% have risen from poor peasants to rich peasants or middle peasants. Absolute poverty has long been eradicated.

The committee's office in Lijin County has hired over ten water conservancy talents and experienced river management personnel to specifically study river course repair, conduct investigations and registrations, plan and assist the masses in resettlement due to relocation caused by river management, and prepare river embankment materials, as well as to calculate the number of workers needed.
