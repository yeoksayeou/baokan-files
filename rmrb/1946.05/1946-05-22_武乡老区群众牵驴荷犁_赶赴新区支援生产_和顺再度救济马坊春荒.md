　　[Changzhi News] The masses in the old liberated area of Wuxiang are currently enthusiastically supporting the production of the masses in the new areas. The Wuxiang Democratic Government, based on the resolution of the county council at the beginning of the month, actively led this movement and issued a call to the people of the old liberated area to support the new areas, in order to solve the production difficulties of the masses in more than a hundred villages located on both sides of the Baijin Railway. This area has suffered from the destruction of the enemy and puppets for eight years, and most of the villages have become no-man's-lands. After the ceasefire order, it was repeatedly attacked by the Japanese and Yan's army, resulting in scorched earth for miles and abandonment. Without the assistance of the old liberated area, it would be difficult for the surviving people to carry out production. Therefore, when the democratic government allocated a large amount of grain for emergency relief, transferred 150 head of livestock from the old liberated area, and organized a large number of people to pull plows to provide support, the local people rekindled the hope of self-reliance in production out of gratitude. In the past week, the support movement in Wuxiang County has formed a upsurge. The first and second districts alone have raised 45 shih of seeds, and support teams from other districts are also pulling donkeys and carrying plows, heading to the new areas in a continuous stream.
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi News] After the masses in the Mafang District of Heshun were mobilized by the government last winter to raise clothing and food for relief, the masses spontaneously organized winter production and survived the winter famine. Now the Heshun County Government has specially allocated another 10,000 jin of grain and hundreds of pieces of single and lined clothing, shoes, and socks to relieve the spring famine, so as to smoothly complete the spring plowing and sowing. The local people are deeply grateful for the government's repeated help and are extremely enthusiastic about production. It is believed that as long as the sowing is completed, the disasters caused by the enemy can be overcome.

　　武乡老区群众牵驴荷犁
    赶赴新区支援生产
    和顺再度救济马坊春荒
    【长治讯】武乡老区群众，现正热烈支援新区群众生产。武乡民主政府，根据月初县议会的决议，积极领导了这一运动，并向全县老区人民发出支援新区的号召，以解决位于白晋两侧百余村庄群众生产的困难。该区八年来，遭受敌伪摧残，大部村庄已成无人区。停战令后，复遭日阎军的不断袭击，致赤地千里，荒芜无人，若无老区援助，九死余生的人民，很难进行生产。因此，当民主政府拨发大批粮食进行急赈，抽调老区牲口一百五十头，组织大批人拉犁前往支援时，当地人民从感激中，又重新燃起了生产自救的希望，一周以来武乡全县的支援运动，已形成热潮，仅一、二两区即募集种子四十五石，其他各区的支援队亦正牵驴荷犁源源赶赴新区。
    【本报长治讯】和顺马坊区群众，经去冬政府发动募衣募粮，进行救济后，群众曾自动组织冬季生产，渡过了冬荒，现和顺县政府特再度拨粮一万斤及单夹衣鞋袜等数百件，救济春荒，以便顺利完成春耕下种。当地人民对政府的一再帮助，深表感激，生产热情极高。咸信只要下种完成后，敌寇造成的灾难，即可摆脱。
