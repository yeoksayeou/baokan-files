　　After the establishment of the Municipal Government in early November last year, the government led and assisted the people in carrying out an emancipation movement. In the struggle to liquidate the remnants of the enemy and puppets through the "five antis" (anti-corruption, anti-rationing, anti-exploitation, anti-espionage, anti-traitors), the people raised their heads, and the more than 20 million yuan that was cleared out was appropriately distributed to the people.

　　Now, all 56 street chiefs in the city are elected entirely by the common people. In this way, the people have become the masters of Andong City. Pang Minhuang, the street chief of Renzhong Street, and Tian Bao'an, the deputy district chief of Yuanbao District, whom I visited, fully demonstrate this point. They were formerly rickshaw pullers, but now they demonstrate extraordinary talent in political work and are supported by the masses.

　　The Municipal Government also carried out urgent relief work, providing relief to 1,001 households of revolutionary martyrs' families, with 94,305 jin of grain; providing relief to 5,091 poor households, with 384,182 jin of grain; providing relief to 420 worker households, with 87,987 jin of grain; and mobilizing the masses to help each other, providing 200,000 yuan in cash relief. During the Lunar New Year, there was not a single beggar on the streets of Andong City.

　　It is not easy for the people of Northeast China, who have suffered 14 years of hardship, to awaken, but it is also the most important thing. The new democratic government abolished the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies of the enemy and puppet era, such as city resident tax, hiring tax, livestock tax, vegetable tax, and more than 20 other types of taxes, and encouraged the masses to freely buy and sell. It also distributed the properties and land confiscated from the enemy and puppets to the common people. More than 2,000 peasant and worker households in Langtou Village received land. The poor were allocated four "tiandi" (a measurement, reportedly six mu per day), and the least were allocated one "tiandi," totaling more than 1,300 "tiandi" (7,800 mu) of enemy and puppet land. Even more significant is that after the people were emancipated, a large-scale production campaign was immediately launched. Now, many factories in the city have started operating. The Yalu River Paper Mill, Andong Textile Mill, Mudanjiang Paper Mill, and Andong Cigarette Paper Mill (the only one in Northeast China), which I visited, are all working intensely, and the increase in output is astonishing. For example, the Andong Textile Mill, formerly the "Toyo Textile Mill" during the Japanese puppet era, had more than 3,000 workers. In the past, the daily output was 50 bolts of cloth. Now, with fewer workers than before, the production has increased to 180 bolts of cloth per day. Zhou Guiliang, a 19-year-old female worker, gave me a good answer to this "mystery" of increased production. She said, "In the past, we would pad the machines with whole bolts of cloth, and when the machines broke down, everyone could rest." Now things have changed because workers participate in the factory management committee, have their own trade unions, and many workers have been promoted to factory directors. Some have become street chiefs, and some have become councilors. Therefore, the machine factories that used to exploit workers have now become their own and have become a solid foundation for the democratic government. A total of 36 public factories have started operation, and 68 private factories have started operation. Mayor Lü also told me a gratifying proportional figure: the industrial and commercial businesses run by the Japanese have all stopped, and those run by the Chinese are gradually increasing. For example, there were originally two Chinese cotton ginning factories, and now there are six; there were originally 53 Chinese iron factories, four Korean factories, and eleven Japanese factories, and now there are 55 Chinese factories; there was originally one Chinese tannery, and now there are five; there were originally 190 Chinese grain stores, eight Korean stores, and five Japanese stores, and now there are 240 Chinese stores. This is because our democratic government has adopted a policy of protecting and supporting private industrial and commercial businesses. Education has also developed significantly along with the improvement of economic life. In the past, there were 20 elementary schools, and now there are 24. In the past, there were 12,158 students in the city, and now there are 13,166. Middle schools include the provincial high school, joint junior high school, Jianguo School, Military and Political School, and Lu Xun Academy of Arts. In terms of social education, many youth clubs, theater groups, night schools, and training classes have been established. More than 1,500 workers participated in literacy night schools, and more than 2,000 children participated in children's night schools.

　　Mayor Lü's hard work and enthusiasm for serving the people have made everything in Andong City orderly and prosperous, so he received praise and support from all councilors at the first session of the Andong City Council.

### 广大群众分得土地人力车夫当了街长  人民翻了身生产大开展  经济生活上升教育显著发展

　　广大群众分得土地人力车夫当了街长
    人民翻了身生产大开展
    经济生活上升教育显著发展
    去年十一月初，市政府成立后，政府领导与帮助人民进行了翻身运动，在反贪污、反配给、反剥削、反特务、反汉奸的对敌伪残余的清算斗争中，人民抬起头来，清算出的二千余万万元，都适当的分配给人民了。
    现在全市五十六条街街长，完全是由老百姓选举出来的，这样，人民成为安东市的主人了。我所访问的仁忠街街长庞民皇，元宝区副区长田保安，就充分证明了这一点。他们以前是人力车夫，现在政权工作中表现出异常的才能，而得到群众的拥护。
    市政府还进行了紧急的救济工作，救济抗属一○○一户，粮食九四三○五斤，救济贫民五○九一户，粮食三八四一八二斤，救济工人四二○户，粮食八七九八七斤，发动群众互助，救济现款二十万元。在过旧历年的时候，安东市街上就没有一个讨饭的人了。
    东北人民受过了十四年的苦痛生活，苏醒是一件不容易的事，但也是最主要的事。新的民主政府取消了敌伪时代的苛捐杂税，如市民捐、雇人捐、畜牧捐、蔬菜捐等二十余种，鼓励群众自由买卖，还把没收敌伪的房产土地分配给老百姓，浪头庄两千多户农民和工人，分到土地，贫穷者有分到四天地（每天六亩）者，最少也分到一天地，共分了敌伪土地一千三百多天地（共七千八百亩），更有积极意义的，是在人民翻身之后，立刻开展了大生产运动，现在全市工厂很多开了工，就我参观过的鸭绿江造纸厂、安东纺织厂、牡丹江造纸厂、和安东卷烟纸厂（东北只此一处），都是紧张的工作着，而且产量的增加，是可惊的，比如安东纺织厂在过去日伪时代的“东洋纺织厂”，有三千多工人，过去每日产量为五十匹布，现在工人比以前减少，而生产量却增为每日一百八十匹布了。关于这一个增产的“谜”，十九岁的女工周桂良，给我一个很好的回答，她说：“过去把成匹的布往机器里垫，机器坏了，大家就能休息。”现在改变了，因为工人参加工厂管理委员会，有了自己的职工会，还有不少工人被提拔当了厂长，他们有的当了街长，有的作了参议员，因此以前吃工人血的机器工厂，现在变为自己了，而且成为民主政府的巩固基础。全部公营工厂已开工者三十六家，私营工厂开工者六十八家。吕市长还告诉我一个可喜的比例数字，日本人经营的工商业都停止了，中国人经营的在渐渐增加起来，如弹花工厂，原来中国人有二家，现在有六家了；铁工厂原来中国人有五十三家，鲜人有四家，日本人有十一家，现在中国人有五十五家；制革工厂中国人原有一家，现在有五家；粮谷店中国人原有一九零家，朝鲜人有八家，日本人有五家，到现在中国人有二四零家。这是由于我们民主政府采取了对于私营工商业保护扶助的政策的缘故。教育工作也都随经济生活的上升而有显著的发展，过去又有二十所小学校，现在有二十四所，过去全市有学生一二一五八人，现在有一三一六六人，中学校有省立高中及联合初中、建国学校、军政学校、鲁迅艺术学校。社会教育方面，成立了许多青年俱乐部、剧团、夜校、讲习班等，有一千五百多工人参加识字夜校、二千多儿童参加了儿童夜校。
    吕市长的辛苦与人民服务的热情，使安东市一切井然有序，欣欣向荣，因此在安东市第一届参议会上，得到了全体参议员的称誉和拥护。
