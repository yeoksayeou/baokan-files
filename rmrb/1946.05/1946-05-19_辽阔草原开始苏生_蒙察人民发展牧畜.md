　　The vast grasslands of Chahar Inner Mongolia have begun to revive from years of profound disaster. Various leagues and banners of the autonomous region are preparing to establish veterinary clinics and grass-cutting stations, provide livestock loans, and restore and prosper animal husbandry. The special product, butter, will be expanded, and butter candies suitable for the taste of Han people will be manufactured. In addition, in some areas, agricultural production has begun. The Mongolians of Habugar this year are exchanging labor with Han people using oxen to sow a large amount of wheat and peas. Government workers there have also planted many vegetables on a trial basis. The Inner Mongolia Industrial Company has established branch companies in Baoyuan, Beizi Temple, and Ming'andu, transporting large quantities of cloth and Mongolian boots. Textile factories have also been established in Huangqi and other places.
