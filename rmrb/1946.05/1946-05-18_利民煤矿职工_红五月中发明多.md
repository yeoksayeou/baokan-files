　　Limin Coal Mine Workers
    Make Many Inventions in Red May
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch News】Workers at the Limin Coal Mine in Fengfeng have already made several inventions in the recently launched May Great Production Movement: The first is a simple electric welding machine invented by ironworker squad leader Comrade Zhao Jinqing after painstaking research. Method: Only two and a half jin of caustic soda and two jin of salt are dissolved in water, and electricity is passed through it, and its effectiveness is the same as that of an electric welding machine. The second is that, after joint research by Factory Director Zhang and squad leader Yao Wenqing and other comrades, a six-foot lathe was modified into an eight-foot lathe, which can repair slightly larger machines. The third is the method of repairing light bulbs invented by Comrade Wang Guoquan of the Electrical Factory: In the past, if the metal connector (with screws or hooks) on the light bulb fell off, it could not be used. After research, Comrade Wang used a mixture of fine sand, hide glue, and fish glue to make a soft paste, which is very strong and durable after being glued on and dried. Previously, if the external wire of the light bulb was broken, it was thought to be broken. Comrade Wang connected the soft wire (fuse) to the broken part, then connected the metal connector with a thick and hard wire, and then glued the head with a self-made soft paste, which is very durable. These inventions of the workers and comrades will ensure the smooth completion of the May Great Production, and with high production enthusiasm, they are continuing to study various technologies and want to invent more things.

　　利民煤矿职工
    红五月中发明多
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社讯】峰峰利民煤矿职工，在新近发动的五月大生产运动中，已有几种发明：第一种是铁工班长赵金清同志经过苦心研究所发明的一种简便电焊机。制法：只用二斤半火碱和二斤食盐，溶化在水里，使电气通过，其效能即与电焊机一样。第二种是经过张厂长与班长姚文庆等同志共同研究，把六尺旋床改制为八尺旋床，能修理稍大的机器了。第三种是电气厂王国荃同志发明的修灯泡办法：过去电灯泡上的金属活头（有螺丝的，有挂钩的）一掉下来即不能用了，王同志研究后，用细砂子、皮胶、鳔胶三种东西合成软膏，粘上以后晾干，非常坚固耐用。从前电灯泡外部的导线断了，便以为坏了，王同志把软性导线（保险丝）接连断处，再用粗硬导线连结金属活头，然后用自制的软膏粘头，十分耐用。职工同志们这些发明，将保证五月大生产的顺利完成，他们在高度生产热情下，正在继续研究各种技术，要发明更多的东西。
