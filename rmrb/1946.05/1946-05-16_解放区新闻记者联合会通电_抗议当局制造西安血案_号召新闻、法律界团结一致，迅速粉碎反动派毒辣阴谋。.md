　　All-Liberated Area Journalists Association Telegram
    Protests Authorities' Creation of Xi'an Massacre
    Calls on Journalists and Legal Professionals to Unite and Swiftly Crush the Reactionaries' Vicious Conspiracy.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] The All-Liberated Area Journalists Association, in protest against the Kuomintang authorities' destruction of the Xi'an Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily and the massacre of prominent figures in Xi'an's journalistic and legal circles, has issued a telegram to journalistic, cultural, educational, and legal circles nationwide, stating: To all news agencies and newspapers, forwarded to cultural, educational, and legal circles nationwide, and to all compatriots:
    Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily, a fair voice in Xi'an, has been forced to cease publication under the Kuomintang authorities' relentless oppression. Mr. Wang Ren, a just lawyer who voluntarily served as the newspaper's legal counsel to uphold freedom of speech, has been executed by the Kuomintang authorities on trumped-up charges. Mr. Li Furen, the editor of the Xi'an Masses' Guide and a democratic figure in Xi'an's educational circles, has been assassinated by Kuomintang agents. All patriots must express their utmost indignation at this series of atrocities!
    Since the Political Consultative Conference, there have been over a hundred cases of the Kuomintang authorities endangering freedom of speech and assassinating just individuals. For example, the unwarranted arrest of preparatory personnel for the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, the ransacking of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily business department and the Democratic Daily business office, the illegal search of the Beiping Liberation Daily and the Xinhua branch office, the sealing off of the Cultural Guide of the Shenyang Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the forced closure of the Guiyang Masses' Bi-Monthly and the Beiping Lu Xun Evening News – these are just a few of the well-known instances of persecution suffered by the press. To undermine peace and democracy and to persist in civil war and dictatorship, the Kuomintang reactionaries spare no brutal means to trample on journalistic endeavors striving for peace and democracy, and they resort to every inhuman plot to murder those who struggle for peace and journalists. These cases raise our vigilance and call for greater unity to swiftly crush the reactionaries' vicious conspiracy!
    Journalists, cultural figures, educators, legal professionals, and all compatriots nationwide, we must unanimously support Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily and the Democratic Guide, demanding that the Kuomintang authorities severely punish the perpetrators of the Xi'an massacre and all those who have perpetrated atrocities that undermine the people's freedom of speech and personal freedom, compensate for losses, immediately cease the acts of terror, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Journalists nationwide must redouble our efforts, treading in the bloodstained footsteps of our martyred predecessors, firmly standing our ground to strive for peace and democracy, standing on the side of speaking for the people, and continuing to fight the Kuomintang reactionaries to the very end!
                                All-Liberated Area Journalists Association, May 11
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 12th] The journalistic circles of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, including People's Daily, Ji'nan Daily, Ji-Lu-Yu Daily, Taihang, Taiyue Xinhua Daily, and Xinhua branch offices, have jointly issued a letter and telegram regarding the Xi'an massacre and the forced closure of the Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily, stating in brief: The Xi'an massacre once again demonstrates that the Kuomintang fascists are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people's peace cause and the national press. They are determined to strangle all journalistic endeavors and journalists who serve the cause of peace and democracy. The journalistic circles nationwide must unite closely, actively assist our colleagues in distress, and demand that Chiang Kai-shek immediately implement the four pledges.

　　解放区新闻记者联合会通电
    抗议当局制造西安血案
    号召新闻、法律界团结一致，迅速粉碎反动派毒辣阴谋。
    【新华社延安十二日电】解放区新闻记者联合会为抗议国民党当局摧残西安秦风工商日报屠杀西安新闻界、法律界名流，顷通电全国新闻、文教、法律界称：全国各通讯社、各报馆转全国文化界、教育界、法律界暨全国同胞公鉴：
    西安的公正的言论机关秦风工商日报在国民党当局百般推残下被迫停刊了，为维护言论自由，自动担任该报法律顾问的公正律师王任先生，被国民党当局以莫须有罪名处死了，西安民众导报主编、西安教育界民主人士李敷仁先生被国民党特务暗杀了。对这一连串的暴行，一切爱国者更需要表示十二万分的愤慨！
    自政协会以来，国民党当局危害言论自由、暗杀公正人士的案件，已有百数十起，例如：南京新华日报筹备人员的无辜被捕，重庆新华日报营业部、民主报营业处等被捣毁，北平解放报与新华分社遭受非法搜查、沈阳中苏友好协会的文化导报被查封、贵阳大众半月刊，北平鲁迅晚报被迫停版，这不过是新闻界受迫害的几件众所皆知的而已。国民党反动派为了破坏和平民主，坚持内战独裁，不惜一切残暴手段，蹂躏为和平民主奋斗的新闻事业，不惜用一切惨绝人寰的毒计，杀害为和平奋斗人士及新闻从业员。这些案件提起我们更大的警觉，要我们更加团结一致，迅速粉碎反动派的毒辣阴谋！
    全国新闻界、文化界、教育界、法律界及全国同胞们，我们要一致声援秦风工商日报及民主导报，要求国民党当局严惩西安血案以及一切摧残人民言论人身自由的暴行凶手，赔偿损失，立即停止恐怖暴行，保证今后不再有类似事件发生。我全国新闻界更应再接再厉，踏着死难诸先烈的血迹，坚定的站稳为和平民主奋斗的立场，为人民说话的立场，和国民党反动派继续奋斗到底！
                                解放区新闻记者联合会五月十一日
    【新华社邯郸十二日电】晋冀鲁豫边区新闻界人民日报、冀南日报、冀鲁豫日报、太行、太岳新华日报及新华分社等顷为西安惨案及秦风工商日报被迫停刊，特联名发出函电，略称：西安惨案，又一次说明国民党法西斯派是中国人民和平事业及全国新闻事业的死敌，他们决心要绞杀一切为和平民主事业服务的新闻事业和新闻从业员，全国新闻界密切团结起来，积极援助被难同业，要求蒋介石立即执行四项诺言。
