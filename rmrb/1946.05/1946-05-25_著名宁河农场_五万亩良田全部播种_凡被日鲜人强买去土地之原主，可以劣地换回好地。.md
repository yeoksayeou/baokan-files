　　Famous Ninghe Farm
    50,000 Mu of Fertile Land Fully Sown
    Original Owners Whose Land Was Forcibly Bought by Japanese and Korean People Can Exchange Inferior Land for Good Land.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 20th] The famous Ninghe Farm, managed by the democratic government, has completed sowing on more than 56,000 mu of fertile land. The rice seedlings are thriving, and the wheat is over a foot tall. The people are visibly delighted, anticipating a bumper harvest. The steaming boilers of the Qiming and Goule agricultural estates have been restored to pump water, which can irrigate more than a thousand mu of rice paddies. The democratic government has loaned more than ten thousand jin of millet to carry out this construction project. Part of the above-mentioned land was originally forcibly purchased and operated by Japanese and Korean people. Now, in order to increase the farmers' enthusiasm for production, the government is returning one mu of wheat land to the original owner for every five mu of alkaline land that was forcibly purchased, and one mu of rice land for every ten mu of cultivated land. The remainder is allocated to poor farmers and families of resistance fighters at low rent for cultivation. All of the more than 4,000 Korean immigrants from the farm were repatriated to their country in batches last month.
