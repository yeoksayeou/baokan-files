　　Xinxiang Team Inspects Anyang Conflict
    Confirms Kuomintang Troops Violated Agreement and Occupied Our Villages
    [Handan Seventeenth Dispatch] The Xinxiang team went to the area west of Anyang on the 14th to investigate the conflict caused by the Kuomintang's occupation of Xibalizhuang and Zhidu on May 2nd. The team arrived at the site for investigation at 12:00 on the 14th, and found many bullet marks on Xibalizhuang and Zhidu villages coming from the Kuomintang military side. The U.S. representative then proved that the so-called conflict in early May was caused by the Kuomintang troops violating the agreement and occupying the two villages. The Kuomintang then falsely claimed that the two villages were occupied by them on January 16th, and the conflict in early May was caused by our army's attack. Our representative, Major General Huang Zhen, immediately took out the situation map presented by the Kuomintang to the executive group on February 18 for verification (our side and the U.S. side both had a copy). The map showed that Xibalizhuang and Zhidu were both in the CCP area. In addition, when the three representatives inspected, they saw with their own eyes that the Kuomintang troops were building bunkers in the two villages. This fully proves that the conflict west of Anyang in early May was entirely caused by the Kuomintang troops occupying the two villages, and the Kuomintang should bear full responsibility. Afterwards, our representative asked U.S. representative Colonel Hoddell for his opinion after the inspection. Hoddell replied: "The Kuomintang army illegally occupied Xibalizhuang and Zhidu and must withdraw. If this agreement cannot be reached, I will submit my opinion to the Beiping Executive Headquarters!" The next day, the team went to the conflict zone north of Anyang for inspection, and the results proved that the responsibility lies entirely with the Kuomintang and not with the Communist side. After obtaining sufficient true information, the team returned to Xinxiang on the 15th.
    [Another dispatch] Yan Xishan fabricated that our army attacked Baicheng Town of Taigu on May 7th. After the Dongqin team went to Taigu for investigation, the truth came to light. The facts prove that it was not the Communist army attacking Baicheng Town, but Yan's army attacking our Pangcun. The Kuomintang representative still tried to deny this, but the U.S. and our representatives insisted on the facts, and the two sides argued endlessly. The team has gone to Taiyuan to ask the central team for instructions.

　　新乡小组视察安阳冲突
    证实国民党军违约攻占我村庄
    【邯郸十七日电】新乡小组十四日亲赴安阳以西地区，调查五月二日国民党攻占西八里庄与置度所引起之冲突事件。小组于十四日十二时到达实地调查，当发觉西八里庄与置度两村自国民党军方面射来弹痕极多，美代表遂证明所谓五月上旬的冲突实系国民党军违约攻占该两村所引起。国方继则诬称该两村系其一月十六日所占，五月上旬的冲突系因我军进攻所引起。我方代表黄镇少将旋即取出二月十八日国方呈送执行组的态势图对证（我方与美方均存一份），该图所绘之西八里庄与置度均在中共地区。加之三方代表视察时，亲眼看见国民党军正在该两村赶修碉堡，由此充分证明五月上旬安阳以西的冲突，完全系由国民党军进占该两村所引起，应由国方负完全责任。事后我方代表询问美方代表霍达礼上校视察后的意见。霍答称：“国军非法攻占西八里庄与置度，必须退出，若不能达到此项协议，我将向北平执行部提出意见！”次日该组又赴安阳以北之冲突区视察，结果均证明责任完全在国方而非在共方。该小组获得充分真实情况后，乃于十五日返新乡。
    【又讯】阎锡山捏造我军于五月七日曾进攻太谷之白城镇，经东沁小组亲赴太谷勘察后，真相大白，事实证明并非共军进攻白城镇，实乃阎军进攻我军之庞村。国方代表对此尚图抵赖，美方与我方代表坚持事实，双方争执不决，该组为此已赴太原请示中心小组。
