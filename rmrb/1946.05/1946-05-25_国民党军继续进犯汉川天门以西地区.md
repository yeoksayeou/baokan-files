　　Kuomintang Troops Continue to Invade Areas West of Hanchuan and Tianmen
　　[Xinhua News Agency Xuanhuadian, 22nd] Kuomintang troops are continuing to expand their offensive against the Pinghan Railway West Jianghan Military Region of the Central Plains Liberated Area. In addition to the attacks on the Shoushan area of Anlu and Yingshan regions on the 16th, which this agency has already reported, areas west of Hanchuan and Tianmen have also been invaded by these troops. On the 14th, a regiment of Kuomintang troops was transferred from Hankou to garrison Hanchuan city. On the 15th, the regiment forcibly commandeered one hundred civilian boats and secretly crossed Diaocha Lake (five miles west of Hanchuan), attacking the Hanjiaji and Xiazigou areas near the west bank of the lake. Yang Fang, the county magistrate of Hanchuan, recently also received dozens of light machine guns from the Hankou Headquarters, preparing to attack Yunmeng and Xiaogan counties. In recent days, Kuomintang troops have continued to reinforce their positions. A large force is concentrating on the line from Hanchuan city to Fenshuigan, thirty miles southwest of Hanchuan, awaiting orders to attack. The Kuomintang troops in the Yuxinhe and Xiajiachang areas, within seventy miles west of Tianmen County, moved out in force on the 15th, attacking the liberated areas west of Tianmen. The Kuomintang troops at Xiayangxiang (more than seventy miles southwest of Jingshan) attacked the Luojiaqiao area, more than thirty miles to the northeast, on the same day. Furthermore, troops of the 16th Division of the Kuomintang army in Jingshan, under the cover of special agents and bandits, moved into Shangjiaji, more than twenty miles northwest of Xiayangxiang.
