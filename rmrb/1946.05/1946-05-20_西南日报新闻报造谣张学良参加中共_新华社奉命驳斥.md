　　Southwest Daily and News Report Fabricate that Zhang Xueliang Joined the CCP
    Xinhua News Agency Ordered to Refute
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th (Delayed)] On the 5th of this month, Chongqing's Southwest Daily, according to a long-distance telephone call from Shanghai's News Report on the 3rd, claimed that Zhou Enlai, during a meeting with reporters in Nanjing, admitted in response to inquiries that Zhang Xueliang was a member of the Communist Party. Xinhua News Agency is ordered to state: This is completely unfounded and originates from malicious fabrication. Mr. Zhang Xueliang has never joined the Chinese Communist Party, and Mr. Zhou Enlai has never made the aforementioned so-called remarks. This rumor by the Kuomintang's News Report, we ask, how can the Kuomintang authorities defend their stubborn violation of the law and the national will by not allowing the innocent Zhang Xueliang to be free and return to the Northeast? Although this clumsy rumor still does not provide any legitimate excuse.

　　西南日报新闻报造谣张学良参加中共
    新华社奉命驳斥
    【新华社延安十四日电】（迟到）本月五日重庆西南日报据上海新闻报三日长途电话称：周恩来在南京接见记者于答复询问时，承认张学良为共产党党员。新华社奉命声明：这完全是一个无稽之谈，其来源出于恶意的造谣。张学良氏既未加入过中国共产党，周恩来氏亦未发表过上述所谓谈话。国民党新闻报的这个谣言，试问何以辩解国民党当局非顽强地违反法律与全国民意，不让无罪的张学良获得自由与回到东北。虽然这个笨拙的谣言，仍然没有提供任何合法的借口。
