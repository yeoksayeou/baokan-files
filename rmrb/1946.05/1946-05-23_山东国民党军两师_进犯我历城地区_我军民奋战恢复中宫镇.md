　　Two divisions of the Kuomintang army in Shandong
    invade my Licheng area
    Our military and civilians fought valiantly and recovered Zhonggong Town
    [Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 20th] The Kuomintang 12th Army's 111th Division and the 96th Army's Provisional 15th Division in Jinan have launched a large-scale invasion of the Licheng area of the Shandong Liberated Area. On the 12th, they forcibly occupied 24 villages and towns including Dajiangou, Dianzi, and Zhonggong (all located more than 30 li south of Jinan). Most villages in the Shaojin and Quanlu districts of Licheng were also completely occupied. Wherever they went, they devastated the families of soldiers and mass organizations. The people's grain in the Liangxianggou and Zhonggong areas was looted. The local military and civilians were filled with indignation and rose up in self-defense, recovering Zhonggong Town on the 16th. This town is the center of the Licheng Liberated Area.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 20th] In order to expand its strength for the civil war, the Kuomintang army in Shandong has reorganized many puppet troops into "National Army": (1) Cai Jingyu's puppet Ludong Peace and National Salvation Army, Zhang Buyun's puppet National Self-Defense Army Third Army, and Jiang Lichuan's puppet troops were reorganized into the Independent Regiment of the 96th Army. (2) Du Yaoting's puppet Gaomi Garrison, and Xiang Mingchen's puppet Qingdao Security Headquarters Fourth Detachment were reorganized into the Independent Regiment of the Eighth Army. (3) Xu Zhenzhong's puppet Third Front Army Sixth Army, Zhai Runqing's puppet Bandit Suppression and Nation Building Army Second Column, and Li Fabao's puppet Shandong Security Second General Detachment were reorganized into the New 36th Division, with Sun Mingyu (who, along with Fang Xianjue, was released by the enemy in 1944 after surrendering and engaged in surrender inducement activities) as the commander, incorporated into the 12th Army. (4) The Independent First Column and Li Hua's puppet troops were incorporated into the 51st Army.
