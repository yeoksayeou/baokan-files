　　【Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 20th】Since the beginning of this month, after Yan Xishan convened a military conference in Yuci, dispatching senior generals such as Zhao Chengshou, Liang Huazhi, Wang Jingguo, Zhao Gong, and Liu Xiaozeng to various counties around Taiyuan and southwestern Shanxi to conduct military deployments, new offensives against the Liberated Areas have begun. On the 11th, two regiments of the 71st Division stationed in Yangqu, along with the 46th Division stationed in Xiangyangdian, totaling over 2,000 men, attacked our Wangfeng Town (about 20 li northwest of Yangqu). Another part of the 71st Division, in coordination with about 200 Japanese soldiers, attacked our Beige Town (about 10 li north of Xugou). At the same time, Yang Yun led over 300 puppet troops, departing from Taiyuan via Xiaodian, and invaded Beige Town, subsequently occupying Chen Town. On the morning of the 13th, over 500 Yan soldiers from Dui Jiuyu in Xiaoyi, with one heavy artillery piece and one mortar, advanced in two routes towards our Xiabao (about 20 li west of Xiaoyi) and Shixiang. After the Yan soldiers attacking Shixiang were repelled, they turned to attack Xiabao, firing over 30 artillery shells at our defending troops, charging three times without success. On the 14th, the 208th and 209th Regiments of the Yan Army stationed in Fenyang, along with the puppet 2nd Regiment led by Li Yucai, totaling over 700 men, with one mountain gun and two mortars, led by Liu Xiaozeng, attacked our Hebei Village in Tezhuang (about 10 li southwest of Fenyang). Another route from Tiantun Town attacked our Dongxi Longguan (about 20 li southwest of Fenyang), attempting to occupy our Sanquan Town (about 30 li southwest of Fenyang). After being repelled by our troops, they turned to occupy our Wenbo Village and Qiaojiazhuang. From the 7th to the 14th of this month, in eight days, the Yan Army launched 17 major offensives against the border areas of Taiyuan, Qingyuan, Xugou, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Fenyang, and Xiaoyi, killing and looting hundreds of our cadres and able-bodied men.
