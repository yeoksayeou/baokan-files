　　Taihang Wheat Suffers from Yellow Dwarf Disease
    Agricultural Bureau Rejects "Yellow Harvest" Saying, Calls for Seed Selection and Soaking to Prevent Next Year
    [Our Changzhi Dispatch] Yellow dwarf disease has become widespread in Taihang, especially affecting One-Six-Nine wheat. According to a report from the First Special District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau: this disease is also developing in wheat-producing areas such as southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan. From Xingtai and Wu'an to the Shangdang area within the Taihang region, vast wheat fields are covered with a layer of diseased orange. As early as 1915, in the suburbs of Peiping, wheat yields were reduced by 70-80% due to this disease. Now, county governments and the masses are very anxious about this and have written to the Taihang Xinhua Daily one after another, requesting methods of treatment. However, according to the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's research, yellow dwarf disease is a contagious disease. The reason for its widespread spread is the excessive rainfall this spring. The only way to save the situation after the fact is to implement good methods and prevent it early. If there are not many diseased plants next year, they can be removed immediately to reduce the spread. However, some people in various places still superstitiously believe in the saying "Black rust is lost, yellow harvest is gained," and do not recognize this danger. For this reason, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has put forward prevention methods for next year, calling on the masses to carry out field selection during the wheat harvest and to implement the salt water soaking method when sowing this autumn. The method is to soak the wheat seeds in salt water with five catties of water and one catty of salt for one hour, then take them out, wash them with cool water, and dry them in the sun, otherwise, it will continue to harm next year.

　　太行小麦发生黄疸病
    农林局指出“黄疸收”说法不对号召选种浸种预防明年
    【本报长治讯】太行各地普遍发生小麦黄疸病，尤以一六九小麦更为严重，据一专区农林局报导：此种病害，在冀南及冀鲁豫等产麦地区亦正发展，从邢台、武安直到太行区内地上党一带，广大麦田，都蒙着一层病态的橙色。远在民国四年北平近郊小麦曾因此种病害，竟至减少收成七至八成。现各县政府与群众对此均十分焦虑，纷纷致函太行新华日报，要求提供救治办法。但据农林局研究，黄疸病系一种传染病，普遍蔓延的原因是今春雨水过多，事后挽救实施良法，只有及早预防，明年病株不多时立即拢掉，亦可减少蔓延。但各地群众部分仍有迷信“黑疸丢，黄疸收”的说法，不认识这种危险。为此农林局特提出明年预防方法，号召群众在麦收时进行田间选种，与今秋下种时实行盐水浸种法，其法以五斤水一斤盐的盐水，浸泡麦种一小时，捞出再以清凉水洗净晒干，否则将继续贻害明年。
