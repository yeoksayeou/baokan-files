　　Kuomintang Authorities Abandon "Irregular" Troops
    Large Numbers of Officers Demobilized, Unemployed
    Plunged into Starvation, Desperately Appeal for Relief
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 26th dispatch] Chengdu Dispatch: Amidst the demobilization clamor of the Kuomintang authorities, they retain officers from their direct line of command while abandoning "irregular" officers. Large numbers of unemployed officers are plunged into starvation and desperately appeal for relief. For several months, the government has established an "Officer Brigade" in Chengdu, recruiting jobless students from the Central Military Academy. After the New Army Reserve Officer examination, they are reassigned to various units. Unemployed officers from Sichuan and Kangding have flocked to Chengdu to register upon hearing the news. As of April, six batches have arrived, each numbering hundreds or thousands. The registration conditions are extremely harsh, requiring unemployment for more than two years, along with various certificates such as academic qualifications and official leave of absence. Later, under the pretext of so-called "imposters and unqualified individuals," all unemployed officers not from the Central Military Academy were rejected outright. Even those who had registered were eliminated. Among one batch of over 1,800 people, 1,100 were disapproved. Large numbers of unemployed officers not from the military academy are stranded on the streets. Driven by desperation, they organized a "Jobless Officer Petition Group" and petitioned the headquarters, putting forward four demands: (1) Please resolve the issue of food and lodging within two days. (2) Expedite the examination of service certificates and accommodate and employ them as much as possible. (3) Hold a qualification examination. (4) If the government cannot resolve the issue, please execute all unemployed officers to spare them from starvation. However, the authorities continue to ignore them. An officer from the group, surnamed Xiao, has already starved to death. A group of unemployed officers not from the military academy wrote a news release and sent it to newspapers in Chengdu, stating: "We managed to scrape together travel expenses to Chengdu from extreme difficulties. First, we went to the Officer Brigade and submitted our certificates, passing strict review before being allowed to register. Unexpectedly, the government suddenly issued an order to stop accepting non-military academy graduates. We and our military academy classmates are both citizens of the Republic of China, both unemployed soldiers, why should we be mistreated?" Finally, they called on all non-military academy classmates and comrades-in-arms across the country who are being mistreated to unite like iron to fight for survival.
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 24th dispatch] Chongqing Dispatch: Teachers from other provinces in middle schools in more than ten counties, including Yongchuan and Neijiang in Sichuan, have recently elected representatives to come to Chongqing, petitioning the Chongqing Executive Headquarters and the Chongqing Office of the Ministry of Education, requesting assistance in returning to their hometowns and demobilizing according to the repatriation method for faculty and staff of national middle schools. However, the authorities have not yet satisfactorily resolved this matter, leading to thirty-three middle school teachers jointly sending letters to Xinhua Daily, appealing to public opinion for support.

　　国民党当局抛弃“杂牌”
    大批军官复员失业
    陷于饥饿绝境群起呼吁救济
    【新华社延安二十六日电】成都讯：国民党当局在复员声中，保留嫡系干部，抛弃“杂牌”军官，大批失业军官陷于饥饿绝境，群起呼吁救济。数月来政府在蓉设“军官大队”，招收中央军校无职学生，经过新军预备军官考试，重新派赴各部队任职，川康各地失业军官，闻讯纷纷来蓉登记，截止四月已到六批，每批数百数千不等。该登记条件极端苛刻，失业须在二年以上，并须有学历、奉令离职等各项证件，后来竟借口所谓“冒名滥竽”，非中央军校失业军官，一概拒绝。已登记者亦均剔除。其中一批共一千八百余名，不核准的就有一千一百名，大批非军校的失业军官流落街头，不得已乃组织“无职军官请愿团”，向行辕府请愿，提出四项要求：（１）请于二日内解决食宿问题。（２）从速检查服务证件，尽量收容任用。（３）举行甄别考试。（４）如政府无法解决，则请将失业军官一并枪毙，免受饥饿而死。但当局仍置之不理。该团军官萧某已遭饿毙，一群非军校的失业军官，写一新闻稿寄成都各报纸，其中称：我们很不容易才从万分困难中筹措了一笔旅费到成都来，首先我们到军官大队呈缴证件，经过严格的审核，才允许登记。想不到突然政府又下一道命令，非军校毕业的停收。我们和军校同学同是中华民国国民，同是失业军人，为什么我们该受虐待？”最后他们号召全国非军校同学而被虐待的战友，象铁一样的团结起来争生存。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】渝讯：四川永川、内江等十余县，中等学校客籍教师，最近纷纷推举代表来渝，分向重庆行营及教育部驻渝办事处请愿，要求按照国立中学教职员还乡办法，帮助他们还乡复员。但当局对此，迄未圆满解决，致有卅三个中学教员，联合投函新华日报向舆论界呼吁声援。
