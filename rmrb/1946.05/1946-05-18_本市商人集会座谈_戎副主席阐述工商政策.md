　　[This City News] Over three hundred merchants from various industries in Handan gathered on the 16th for a symposium at the Border Area Council Hall. Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government attended and spoke, mainly elaborating on industrial and commercial policies, particularly encouraging the operation of industries such as leather, matches, cement, iron, pigments, soap, textiles, oil pressing, and paper making. In addition to a one-third reduction in business tax, loan assistance may also be provided. Increase wages, treat technical personnel preferentially, and at the same time take care of factory profits, ensuring that capitalists' profits are greater than in the Kuomintang areas. Publicly owned factories and stores, except for those of a supply nature, shall not enjoy any privileges. Subsequently, Mayor Wang spoke, explaining the government's policy of developing commercial capital. He said: For stores with enemy and puppet funds, only the enemy and puppet portion will be taken over as government or mass shares for continued operation, and will not be withdrawn. Y茂祥皮货店(Yu Mao Xiang Leather Goods Store) had a batch of goods from the enemy, and after voluntarily reporting it, the municipal government handled it according to the above-mentioned method. He also said: Merchants who fled before and after liberation due to enemy and puppet deception and propaganda are welcome to return to their hometowns to do business. During the meeting, the merchants from various industries nodded frequently, very satisfied, after hearing the government's commercial policies. Finally, in order to implement industrial and commercial policies and strengthen merchant work, the meeting decided to expand and reorganize the Chamber of Commerce into the Federation of Industry and Commerce. First, a preparatory committee for the Federation of Industry and Commerce will be established. Pei Zengren, Du Shanzheng, Liu Rennong, Zhang Jutian, Yang Li, Li Shengtang, Li Qingjie, Ren Bingxian, Ni Jingtiao, and Guo Jin were appointed as committee members, and Wang Gengwu, Li Jirui, and Zhang Guoxiang as chairman and vice chairmen. Large and medium-sized merchants and small vendors also had their own representatives. Subsequently, Wang Gengwu, director of the preparatory committee, and Yang Shenqing, president of the original Chamber of Commerce, spoke successively. The meeting lasted five hours before adjourning.
