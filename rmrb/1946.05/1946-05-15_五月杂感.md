　　Random Thoughts in May
    Whenever I turn the calendar to May, I always feel a bit heavy. There are simply too many shocking days of bloodshed, tyranny, and humiliation: May Third, May Seventh, May Ninth, May Thirtieth, May Thirty-first... Although there are also two glorious holidays, May First and May Fourth, after all, they are also connected to bloodshed, tyranny, or humiliation.
    This May, when I opened the calendar, I had a peculiar thought. I thought: the unequal treaties were abolished three years ago, and last August, the national enemy Japan surrendered. Then, on our calendar, we should also erase this large debt of bloodshed, tyranny, and humiliation. It would be best to leave only pleasant and joyful holidays, so that when I look at the calendar in the second half of my life, I no longer feel the weight of humiliation on my shoulders, and my eyes are not filled with pools of blood.
    But after all, a peculiar thought is just a peculiar thought. There are some people in China with special hobbies, who take humiliation as glory, tyranny as benevolent governance, and the blood of the people as fine wine. Students in Kunming shed blood, students in Shanghai shed blood, famous scholars in Chongqing who fought for freedom and democracy for the people shed blood, journalists in Nantong and Xi'an shed blood, and university professors in Beiping also shed blood. In just half a year, new tragedies and new massacres have followed one after another, far more than the cases accumulated on the calendar for many years. As for arbitrarily arresting people, destroying newspaper offices and venues, confiscating books and newspapers, breaking into private homes and public residences, and assassinating anti-Japanese generals, in the eyes of the Kuomintang authorities, these are just trivial matters, truly one generation surpassing another.
    In the Beiping Zhongshan Park tragedy, the Mr. Jiang Shaoyuan who was beaten was precisely the very person who burned Cao Rulin's residence in Zhao Jia Lou during the May Fourth Movement. Twenty-eight years ago, during the era of the Northern Warlords, students still had the freedom to burn down the residences of traitors. But twenty-eight years later, when the "promise" of the four major freedoms is supposedly in place, a professor, merely after giving a few moderate speeches about peace and democracy, is beaten until his head is broken and bleeding. Look at how domineering the modern Kuomintang reactionaries truly are!
    So domineering that they won't allow people to speak, won't allow meetings, won't allow articles to be written, won't allow newspapers to be published, forcing everyone to obediently stretch out their necks and be manipulated. If they show the slightest resistance, then all kinds of weapons from the century before to the twentieth century – stones, clubs, grenades, rifles, rocket launchers, airplanes – will all come rushing over.
    However, reactionaries, don't be complacent. Although you create tragedies more fiercely and frequently than your predecessors, the people, through a century of bloodshed, have not only not been intimidated, but have also learned to be wiser, more steadfast, and more courageous from their own bloodshed. We will still speak! We will still reason! We will still write articles! We will still publish newspapers! Let me remind you, Fascists! Creating tragedies will not intimidate the people. If you still want to create more new tragedies to feel satisfied, then your path to follow the path your predecessors took is certain.

### 五月杂感

　　五月杂感
    一到日历翻掀到五月，总感到有些沉重，那种触目惊心的流血，暴虐耻辱的日子，实在太多了——五三、五七、五九、五卅、五卅一……虽其间也有像五一、五四这两个光荣的节日，但毕竟它与流血暴虐或耻辱也有过连系的。
    今年五月，我一翻开日历，却发生了一种异想，我想：不平等条约在三年前废除了，去年八月，民族的劲敌日本投降了，那末在我们的日历上，也该抹消掉这一大笔流血暴虐和耻辱的旧账才好。尽可光留些愉快欢娱的节日，让我这后半辈瞧日历时，不再觉得肩上压有千斤的耻辱，满眼是一滩滩的鲜血。
    但异想毕竟是异想，中国偏偏有一些特殊嗜好的人们，拿耻辱当光荣，拿暴虐当仁政，拿人民的鲜血当美酒的；昆明的学生流了血，上海的学生流了血，重庆替人民争自由民主的名流学者流了血，南通和西安的新闻记者流了血，北平的大学教授也流了血。短短半年之中，新惨案新屠杀是接踵而至，倒比日历上积累了多少年月的案件，多得不可同日而语。至于任意逮捕人民，捣毁报馆会场，没收书报，闯入民宅公馆，暗杀抗日名将，这在国民党当局老爷们看来，不过像头般的小事，也真是一代胜过一代。
    在北平中山公园惨案中，那个被殴的江绍原先生，正是五四时火烧赵家楼曹汝霖公馆的张本人。二十八年前，北洋军阀时代倒还有学生火烧卖国贼公馆的自由，但在二十八年后，据说是四大自由有了“诺言”的时候，以教授的身份，仅温和的讲了几句和平民主的话，就要被打得头破血流，你看现代的国民党反动派，真是霸道到什么地步！
    霸道到要人民话不许讲，会不许开，文章不许写，报纸不许出，大家服服贴贴，伸长脖子，一仟摆布，如果稍示反抗，那么从世纪前到二十世纪的各色武器——石头、棍棒、手榴弹、步枪、火箭炮、飞机，都一劲儿的冲了过来。
    可是，反动派你且不要得意，尽管你制造惨案要比你先人凶而且多，但人民也在这百年来的流血中，不仅没有被吓倒，而且也从自己的流血中，学得更智慧、更坚定、更勇敢了；话依旧要讲！理依旧要评！文章依旧要写！报纸依旧要出，让我提醒你一句法西斯派！制造惨案是吓不倒人民的，如果你还要一劲儿制造更多的新惨案才觉过瘾，那么你要走上你们先人所走过的道路，是肯定了的。
