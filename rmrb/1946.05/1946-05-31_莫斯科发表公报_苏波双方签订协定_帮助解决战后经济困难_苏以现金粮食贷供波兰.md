    Soviet and Polish Sides Sign Agreement
    Aiding in Solving Post-War Economic Difficulties USSR Provides Poland with Cash and Grain Loans
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] Moscow News: A Soviet-Polish negotiation communiqué was issued here on the 26th. The communiqué stated that the delegation led by Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Polish National Assembly, and Prime Minister Edward Osóbka-Morawski, arrived in Moscow on the 23rd. Stalin and Molotov held multiple talks with them, examining the issues of continuing to develop and consolidate the friendly cooperation between the Soviet and Polish people. All the talks were conducted in a friendly manner and with mutual understanding. The communiqué pointed out that the Soviet and Polish sides have signed an agreement stipulating the cancellation of Poland's obligations during wartime due to Soviet armed assistance. It also stipulated that before Poland establishes its own metallurgical industry and arms production industry, the Soviet government will be responsible for providing long-term loans, or lending weapons and ammunition to the Polish army without compensation. It will also lend cash to Poland to help Poland overcome the lack of monetary funds to meet Poland's urgent economic needs. At the same time, in order to alleviate the food difficulties caused by war damage in Poland, the Soviet government has decided to take measures to accelerate the supply of grain to Poland. The communiqué finally declared that the negotiation also exchanged views on issues such as the German question, Soviet-Polish trade relations, cultural exchanges, and the repatriation of Polish residents from the Soviet Union and the repatriation of Russians, Ukrainians, and Lithuanians from Poland to the Soviet Union, demonstrating that the views of the two governments are consistent. Furthermore, the Polish government delegation left the Soviet Union on the 27th to return home.
