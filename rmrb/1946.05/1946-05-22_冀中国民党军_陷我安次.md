　　Kuomintang Troops in Ji'zhong
    Occupy An'ci
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Hejian dispatch: A unit of the 21st Division of the Kuomintang's 92nd Army, totaling over 500 men, in coordination with puppet troops from Luòfā and other places, attacked An'ci County in the Ji'zhong Liberated Area on the morning of the 15th. The defending troops bravely defended themselves, but due to the disparity in numbers, they withdrew from the city. Another unit of the 21st Division fiercely attacked Pánggèzhuāng, briefly entering it, but were repelled by the stationed Eighth Route Army. However, the village remains under siege by the Kuomintang troops. An'ci is located south of the Píngjīn Railway, 65 kilometers southeast of Beijing, where the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters is located. The city was recovered by the Eighth Route Army from the enemy and puppets in September of last year, and was briefly occupied by the Kuomintang troops and puppet troops on October 14th of the same year, before being recovered by the Eighth Route Army on the 22nd, and has remained so until now. Pánggèzhuāng is located between Beijing and An'ci. This Kuomintang military invasion is clearly the beginning of a plan by warmongers to occupy the Píngjīn-Bǎo triangle area.

　　冀中国民党军
    陷我安次
    【新华社延安十九日电】河间讯：国民党九十二军之第二十一师一部五百余人，配合落垡等地伪军，于十五日上午进攻冀中解放区安次县城，守军英勇自卫，因众寡悬殊，撤出该城。又第二十一师另一部，猛攻庞各庄，一度攻入，为驻地八路军击退，但该庄仍处于国民党军围攻中。安次位于平津铁路南侧，为军调执行部所在地北平东南六十五公里，该城在去年九月间为八路军自敌伪手中收复，曾在同年十月十四日为国民党军及伪军一度侵占，旋于二十二日又为八路军恢复，以迄于今。而庞各庄则位于北平与安次之间。国民党军这次进犯，显系好战分子企图占领平津保三角地区的计划之开端。
