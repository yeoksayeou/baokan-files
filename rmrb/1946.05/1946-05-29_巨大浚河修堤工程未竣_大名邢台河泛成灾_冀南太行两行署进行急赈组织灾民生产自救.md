　　[Our Newspaper’s Report] In mid-May, continuous heavy rain fell in the Jinan and Taihang areas. The massive mass dredging and embankment project on the Daming and Xingtai areas had not yet been completed when the rivers swelled and flooded, causing disasters. In the Daming and Wei County areas of the Jinan Third Sub-district, more than 160 villages were flooded, with the 16 villages within the Wei County remote embankment being the most severely affected. According to statistics from 49 villages in Wei County alone, over 1,800 houses collapsed, and over 1,300 hectares of land were flooded. All autumn seedlings were drowned, and the wheat harvest was reduced by half, with the best yield being only 50%. In the first, second, and third districts east of the Pinghan Railway in Xingtai, the terrain is very low. At the junction of the second and third districts, there are four large depressions (basins). This heavy rain caused eight villages including Wujiaqiao and Hequ to be flooded, inundating over 10,600 hectares of farmland. Autumn seedlings were drowned, and only 60% of the summer wheat could be harvested. The democratic governments of the two districts are actively carrying out relief work. The Jinan Administrative Office has allocated 1 million jin of relief grain and 800,000 yuan in relief funds to the Daming disaster area. County Magistrate Wu of Xingtai County and the county's Construction Section rushed to the disaster area to express sympathy, investigate the situation, carry out emergency relief, and organize sideline production for disaster victims to strive for self-salvation after the disaster occurred. The Taihang Administrative Office has approved the allocation of 10,000 jin of grain for work relief and is actively organizing the local masses to dig channels for drainage, excavating a 7.5 kilometer-long drainage canal from Puzhou Tun to Da Lü Village to allow accumulated water to flow into the Niuwei River. After this canal is completed, the flooded land can be replanted with autumn seedlings, and the four depressions can also be transformed into fertile fields. The canal construction has already begun.

    冀南太行两行署进行急赈组织灾民生产自救
    【本报讯】本月中旬，冀南太行两地大雨连绵，大名、邢台地区巨大之群众浚河修堤工程，尚未完成之际，各河暴涨，泛滥成灾。冀南三分区大名、魏县境内，计淹村庄一百六十多村，以魏县遥堤以内十六村为最重；仅魏县四十九村统计，房屋倒塌一千八百余间，淹地一千三百余顷，秋苗全部淹死，麦收减到一半，最好的不过五成。邢台平汉路东一、二、三区，地势很低，二三区交界处，并有四个大凹（盆地），此次大雨，致使吴家桥、河曲等一带八个村庄都被淹没耕地面积一万六千余亩，秋苗淹死，夏麦只能收获六成，现两区民主政府，正积极进行救济，冀南行社已对大名灾区拨发救济粮百万斤，救济款八十万元。邢台吴县长及该县建设科，于灾情发生后，即赶赴灾区慰问调查，并进行急赈，组织灾民副业生产以努力自救。太行行署已批准拨发以工代赈粮一万斤，积极组织当地群众开渠排水，挖掘由蒲洲屯，通至大吕村十五里长之排水渠，使积水流入牛尾河，此渠修成后，水淹之地，还可补种秋苗，四处凹地亦可变成良田，现该渠已经动工开凿。
