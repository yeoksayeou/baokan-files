    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 17th] The heroic self-defense war of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces, using their blood to protect the freedom and happiness of the Northeast people, has won widespread love and cheers. A wave of support for the troops is developing universally in cities and villages. On the 13th, a delegation of 125 people from all walks of life in Changchun, led by Mr. Che Xiangchen, the vice director of the troop support committee and an old educator in the Northeast, departed on behalf of the 800,000 people of Changchun for the front lines of Sipingjie. In a letter from people from all walks of life in Changchun to the soldiers at the front, it was written: "Fight bravely, we vow to contribute all our strength to aid the front lines!" The Gongzhuling Youth Women and Education Joint Association performed dramas and sang songs on the 7th of this month to comfort the commanders and fighters. In recent days, various organs, organizations, and schools throughout the city have visited wounded soldiers eight times. The comfort group from Dongfeng County, Liaobei Province, also went to the front lines to support the troops. The Xifeng County Girls' School wrote in a letter of comfort to the front lines: "You are a good backing for the people of Northeast China, and we resolutely support you!" Representatives from the Changyi District Trade Union and Farmers' Association in Jilin County, after comforting the wounded soldiers, said with tears in their eyes: "They are too hard-working!" All staff members of the Jilin China-Soviet Friendship Association wrote in a letter of comfort: "We vow to resolutely advance along your glorious path!" The masses in Jiangbei District of Jilin City said: "We, the people in the rear, don't know how to thank you enough, we can only repay you by working hard to cultivate the land and produce more." All members of the Jilin City Medical Association also sincerely wrote letters to comfort the wounded soldiers, saying: "Please recuperate peacefully, we are willing to do our best to help you recover your health as soon as possible." More than 40 people from the Andong Hui Muslim Association and 500 members of the Central District Trade Union of Andong City went to the hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers. In addition, northern Manchuria and western Liaoning and other places have also organized comfort groups to go to the front lines to support the troops.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th] On May 4th, 150,000 workers, merchants, students, women, and children in Harbin City held a grand celebration in Zhaolin Park to welcome the Democratic Allied Forces. On that day, the whole city was decorated with flags and colored lights, and drums and music were played everywhere. At the opening of the meeting, the heroic and valiant people's soldiers marched into the park in orderly steps and stood solemnly in front of General Li Zhaolin's tomb to pay their respects. The meeting was declared open, and Xie Yuqin, the chairman of the presidium, delivered a speech in a pleasant and passionate tone. He said: "The Democratic Allied Forces have brought infinite happiness to the people of Harbin, warmed every desolate heart, it is our strong national defense, the lighthouse of new democratic construction, and our great savior! They rescued us from the clutches of the Japanese robbers with their heads and blood, giving us freedom and security of life. Now Harbin does not hear the sound of artillery, nor are there thieves and robberies, we should dedicate our sincere hearts and unite firmly with them forever to defend peace and democracy!" Then, citizen representative Yan Zhian, worker representative Dai Zhen, merchant representative Zhang Tingge, youth representative Zhao Naihe, women's representative Kong Huanshu, and others, spoke on behalf of people from all walks of life. They all expressed their deep gratitude and warm welcome to the Democratic Allied Forces, and at the same time called on all citizens of Harbin to mobilize together to support the Democratic Allied Forces. Finally, General Zhong Ziyun, political commissar of the Harbin Garrison Command, delivered a reply, saying: "This meeting is not only the people welcoming the army, but also the army welcoming the people, because the Democratic Allied Forces protect the people, and the people of Northeast China also help the army. After General Zhong recounted many historical facts of the People's Self-Defense Forces and the Democratic Allied Forces shedding blood and fighting for the interests of the people for the past fourteen years, he called on all the people of Northeast China to rise up and stop the attacks of all reactionary efforts." After the reply, the telegram was passed, and the meeting closed in thunderous and passionate slogans.
