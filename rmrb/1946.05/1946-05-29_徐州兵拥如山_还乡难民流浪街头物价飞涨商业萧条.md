　　Xuzhou Overrun with Soldiers
　　Returning Refugees Homeless, Prices Soar, Commerce Stagnates
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th Dispatch] Xuzhou Dispatch: The current Xuzhou is truly a mountain of soldiers. Nationalist troops are concentrated around Xuzhou, and the city itself is a world of soldiers. Civilian houses have either become armories or barracks, leaving compatriots returning home to wander the streets. Therefore, besides the abundance of soldiers in Xuzhou, there are also many refugees. The Nationalist army has completely "taken over" the Japanese invaders' methods of governance. People must salute when they see sentries, and rickshaws must stop and show respect when they see jeeps. The theaters are forced to "give preferential treatment to soldiers," offering half-price tickets across the board. The people dare to be angry but dare not speak out. All prices rise daily. The price of wheat has reached 15,000 yuan per bag. The people's lives are extremely difficult, so the market is very depressed. Many large department stores only earn tens of thousands of yuan each day, so everyone is preparing to close down. At night, Xuzhou is a black, dead city. After 11:00 PM, the people cannot travel freely.

　　徐州兵拥如山
    还乡难民流浪街头物价飞涨商业萧条
    【新华社延安二十五日电】徐州讯：目前的徐州，真是兵山一座，徐州周围集中国民党大军，城内也是军人世界，民房不是成了军火库，就成了兵舍，逃难还乡的同胞们只好流浪街头。因此，徐州除了军人多之外，便是难民多了。国民党军队完全“接收”了日寇的统治办法，人民碰见哨兵要敬礼，黄包车碰见吉普车也要停下表示尊敬，戏院被迫“优待军人”，一律半价，老乡们都敢怒不敢言，所有物价天天涨，麦价已达一万五千元一袋，人民生活困苦已达极点，故市场十分萧条，许多大百货商店，每天收入不过几万元，因此大家都准备关门。夜间的徐州，是一座黑色的死城，十一时以后，人民就无法通行了。
