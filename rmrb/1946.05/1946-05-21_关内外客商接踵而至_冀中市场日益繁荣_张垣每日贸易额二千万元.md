　　Merchants from Within and Beyond the Great Wall Arrive in Droves
    Hebei-Central Market Increasingly Prosperous
    Zhangjiakou Daily Trade Volume Reaches 20 Million Yuan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 11th] The main industrial and commercial markets of Hebei-Central are becoming increasingly prosperous. Merchants from Henan, Shandong, Suiyuan, and beyond the Great Wall are arriving in droves. Vehicles and ships transporting goods on both land and water are constantly bustling. Anguo, a well-known distribution center for medicinal materials, has seen 109 pharmacies resume business. Electric light factories, automobile transportation companies, post offices, etc., are all in the process of being established in the city. The Xinji large leather goods market has also been revitalized. There are currently 65 leather and fur trading firms, and 54 leather factories and workshops have also resumed operations. The daily market supply of cattle and sheep hides reaches more than 4,000 pieces. In order to invigorate the market's finance and facilitate commercial remittances, privately-owned banks have been established in Anguo and Xinji. In Mozhou, a commercial hub forty li north of Renqiu, nearly 20 business firms from Tianjin and Beiping have recently moved here to operate. The Mozhou market can trade over 2,000 dan of grain and over 21,000 bolts of native cloth. Every day, a large amount of grain and native cloth from various parts of Hebei-Central are transported to the Kuomintang-controlled areas to alleviate the urgent needs of the people. Every day, over 30 large carts of grain and native cloth are transported from Xinji to Shijiazhuang, and over 10 large carts of medicinal materials are transported from Anguo to Tianjin every day.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th] The number of commercial firms in Zhangjiakou City has now grown to 2,716, and the number of small vendors has grown from over 1,000 to over 10,000. The daily trade volume of the Zhishan Street small commodities market reaches over 20 million yuan. The Zhangjiakou markets for fur, grain, and livestock, which were famous in North China before the war, are all rapidly recovering. Due to the smooth transportation between the border areas and the interior, and the rising living standards of farmers, there is an urgent need for a large number of daily necessities. As a result, the grain market is unprecedentedly active, with the highest daily trading volume reaching over 7,000 dan, and the average being around 2,500 dan. There are now 248 fur firms that have reopened, and each market sees over 1,000 heads of livestock. The area near Zhangjiakou is rich in produce. Wheat production in Chahar Province is over 70,000 tons per year. Each league and banner can export 2.1 million jin of camel and sheep wool annually, 840,000 jin of camel and sheep down, and 200,000 dan of pond salt and earth salt. In addition, livestock, cattle and sheep hides, medicinal materials, and pigs are also major exports. In the future, under the democratic government's effective measures to develop industry and commerce, Zhangjiakou's commerce will surely become increasingly prosperous.
