　　Grain Reserves Exhausted in British-Occupied Zone of Germany
    Nine Million Germans to Starve
    Italian Women and Starving People Attack a Landowner's House
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] According to a Reuters dispatch: Authorities in the British-occupied zone of Germany declared: Nine million Germans in the British-occupied zone are about to starve to death. Due to the exhaustion of grain reserves, the daily food ration will be reduced to 400-500 calories. Under the current rationing of 1,000 calories per day, human life can barely be sustained for six months. However, according to a Reuters dispatch from Singapore: Food rations in Singapore will be further reduced from the 20th. The food rations for women and children are particularly pitiful. Children will receive only two and a quarter ounces per day, and women only four ounces, barely enough to sustain life. The reason for the reduction is that the United Nations Food Bureau has reduced the allocation to Malaya by an average of half.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] Rome Dispatch: Five hundred starving women in Biseno City angrily attacked the house of a landowner (who is also a banker), protesting against the landowner's exploitation of them and demanding that he hand over food. When the police arrived, the women had already destroyed the landlord's door and rushed into the inner room. The group of women also attacked a local bakery and seized 300 pounds of bread.

    九百万德人将饿毙
    意妇女饥民袭击某地主家
    【新华社延安十八日电】据路透社电：德境英占区当局宣称：英占区内九百万德人即将饿死，由于存粮已空，每日粮食配给的热量将降至四五百卡罗里，即按目前每日一千卡罗里的配给情况，人类的生命亦只能勉强维持六个月。但据路透社新加坡讯：新加坡粮食配给，自二十日起又将减少，妇孺的粮食配给，尤其可怜，儿童将以每日二又四分之一两，女人仅四两，勉强维持生活。减少的原因，是联合粮食局将马来亚的分配量平均减低一半。
    【新华社延安十八日电】罗马讯：比塞诺城五百饥饿的妇女，怒袭某地主家（他也是银行家），抗议地主对她们的剥削，并要求拿出粮食。当警察赶至时，妇女已摧毁地主的房门，并冲进内室。该群妇女又袭击当地面包店，夺去面包三百磅。
