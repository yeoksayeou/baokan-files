　　Shandong's Three Thousand Mile Coastline
    One Hundred Thousand Fishermen and Salt Workers Actively Increase Production
    [New China News Agency, Linyi, 14th] Along Shandong's liberated areas' coastline, extending over three thousand li from Qikou in Hebei to Lianyungang in Jiangsu, one hundred thousand salt and fishing workers are actively engaged in production. Over 200,000 mu of salt fields are being used for salt production, and over 2,000 fishing boats are catching fish. It is estimated that this year's salt production will reach 200 million jin, and fish production in the Jiaodong area alone will reach at least 100 million jin. Yantai, Weihai, and Shidao are all well-known fishing centers in North China. Shidao is also one of the four major salt fields in the country. According to incomplete statistics, to date, the democratic government has loaned over 70 million yuan in local currency and provided over 100,000 jin of grain to help fishermen and salt workers. It has also purchased and sold large quantities of stored salt to stabilize salt prices. In Jiaodong and Bohai areas alone, approximately 60 million jin of salt have been purchased and sold. Furthermore, various exorbitant taxes and levies from the enemy and puppet regime period have been abolished. After denouncing traitors and expressing grievances, the production enthusiasm of fishermen and salt workers has greatly increased. For example, Tuo Wang salt fields (in Ganyu County) have increased from 2,000 mu to 10,000 mu, and production has increased from 200,000 dan to 1.2 million dan. Yangjiaogou has increased from 30 *fangtan* to 187 *fangtan*. South of Qikou, salt workers have built 20 large seawalls this spring, opening up 15,000 mu of new salt flats. The 20,000 mu of barren beaches in Jiaodong are being actively restored. This year's production is expected to increase by one-third compared to last year, and fisheries are expected to increase tenfold or more. Fishermen's and salt workers' cooperatives have been established in various places. There are 12 in the Bohai area and over 40 in the Jiaodong area. The larger-scale ones include the public-private joint venture Yantai Aquatic Products Company, which has capital of over 2.8 million yuan and a large cold storage facility with a freezing room capable of storing over 200 tons of aquatic products. Fishermen can entrust the company to sell on their behalf free of charge and not below the market price. As a result, the lives of fishermen and salt workers have greatly improved, and the sideline income of farmers has also increased. Binhai alone can produce 700 million jin of salt this year, and transportation can generate profits of 100 million yuan.

　　山东三千里海岸线上
    十万渔盐民积极增产
    【新华社临沂十四日电】山东解放区北起河北之祁口、南迄江苏连云港，长达三千余里之海岸线上十万盐渔民，积极从事生产，已有二十余万亩盐田晒盐，二千余只渔船捕鱼，今年预计可产盐二十万万斤，鱼产仅胶东地区，今年至少产一万万斤。烟台、威海、石岛，均为华北著名之渔业重心。石岛又为全国四大盐场之一。据不完全统计：迄今民主政府已贷出款本币七千余万元，救济粮食十余万斤，救济渔盐民，并大量收买与推销存盐，以稳定盐价，仅胶东渤海两地，即收买推销食盐约六千万斤，并取消了敌伪时期的种种苛捐剥削，渔民盐民在反奸诉苦后，生产情绪大为提高。如拓汪盐田（属赣榆县）已由二千亩增至一万亩，产量由二十万担增至一百廿万担。羊角沟已由三十方滩？增至一百八十七方滩。十二月祁口以南盐民，今春又修筑击潮大围二十处，开辟新盐滩一万五千亩。胶东二万荒滩，正在积极修复中。今年较去年可增产三分之一，渔业可增至十倍以上，各地渔盐民，已成立渔盐业合作社，渤海已有十二处，胶东已有四十余处。规模较大者，为公私合营之烟台水产公司，拥有资金二百八十余万元，并设有大冷藏库，冻结室一所，能贮藏二百吨以上之水产品，渔民可免费委托该公司代卖且不低于市价，因之渔盐民生活大为改善，农民的副业收入，亦因而增加。滨海一地，今年可产盐七万万斤，运输可获利十万万元。
