　　The Thriving Jining City

　　Jining City is located in the southwestern part of Shandong Province, at the eastern end of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region. It is the terminus of the Yanzhou-Jining branch line of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and the hub of the Yanji (Yanzhou-Jining), Jihe (Jining-Heze), Jijin (Jining-Jinxiang), Jidong (Jining-Dong'a), and Jiyun (Jining-Yuncheng) highways. The Grand Canal flows through the south of the city, making both water and land transportation extremely convenient. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of over twenty counties in southwestern Shandong. The city has more than four hundred and sixty streets of varying sizes, with a population of over 150,000, making it the largest city in the entire border region and the second-largest city in Shandong Province. Having suffered all kinds of devastation during the enemy's occupation, its vitality was greatly diminished. However, since being liberated by the Eighth Route Army on January 9th of this year, and under the democratic government's active implementation of democratic construction, promotion of industry and commerce, reduction of the people's burden, and establishment of education policies, the city has shown a thriving new atmosphere in just four months. The recent situation is introduced below:

            Commerce

　　After eight years of oppression and rule by the enemy and traitors, the various businesses in Jining City were extremely depressed. More than eighty percent of the city's stores, large and small, had closed down. The Jining branch of the Hebei-Jinan Bank issued a large number of commercial loans. In April alone, the amount of commercial loans reached 14,612,000 yuan. Various businesses are rapidly recovering. There are now more than four thousand businesses, large and small, that have resumed operations, and forty-three trade associations have been organized. The city's industries are dominated by the leather industry. The furs from more than twenty counties in western Shandong, northern Henan, and northern Jiangsu are collected and distributed here. Before the war, four million pieces of lambskin could be exported annually. All fifty leather firms in the city closed down after the enemy arrived. Currently, twenty firms have resumed large-scale trading, exporting approximately ten thousand pieces of fur daily, worth a total of 70,000,000 yuan. Before the war, the wool trade could reach seven to eight hundred thousand jin per day when spring wool came on the market. It is estimated that this year, it can recover to half of the pre-war level. The second most important trade is in grain, especially wheat. The wheat produced in wheat-producing areas such as Wenshang, Jinxiang, and Yutai is also collected and distributed here. Currently, there are four large grain markets in the city, one of which, the Bakou Grain Market, has ten large grain firms, selling three hundred dan of grain daily. The third is the livestock trade. Livestock from the Northeast also pass through here. Three hundred and eighty heads can be traded daily, amounting to 4,700,000 yuan. The trade in homespun cloth reaches 6,000,000 yuan per day. The Commercial Bureau held a symposium for the city's industrial and commercial circles, announcing the democratic economic policy, exempting various exorbitant taxes and levies, and jointly studying the direction of industrial and commercial construction. Now, old people who did not dare to enter the city for eight years are rushing to the city to do business, and the market is becoming more and more prosperous.

            Industry

　　The industry of Jining City is also rapidly recovering with the support of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Jining Fourth Branch of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Trading Company. Dozens of larger factories, such as electric lights, flour, matches, egg factories, and ironworks, have started operations one after another.

　　The electric light company, on the evening of Jining's liberation, the sound of motors was rumbling, turning the dark and silent city of Jining into a bright and glorious city. The factory has two 360-horsepower generators and one No. 2 boiler. With the hard work of all the factory employees all night, it can provide electricity for 23,000 electric lights in the city. In addition to working hard at their jobs, they are preparing to repair water pipes to sell water, and to operate an electrical materials shop as a sideline production. In addition, they can also share the profits of the company in half.

　　Jifeng Flour Company, with government funding, officially started operations on April 10th. Currently, Mr. Gui Jifeng represents the former owner of the factory, Liu Zhuqiao, and signed a contract with the government to jointly operate the factory. It has a total capital of 70,000,000 yuan (Ji banknotes), and produces 40,000 jin of flour per day. Once the machinery is repaired, it will be able to produce 80,000 jin per day. Not only can it supply the needs of the city, but it can also be sold to major cities such as Jinan, Xuzhou, Beiping, and Tianjin. Several of the city's original iron factories mostly manufactured gunpowder and other weapons when the enemy was present. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the border region's military industry began to shift to manufacturing production tools. The military industry department of the military region changed the Jining arsenal into an industrial and agricultural manufacturing plant, turning the original sand-turning department into an agricultural tool manufacturing department, the mechanical department into a machine manufacturing department, and the gunpowder and electrical department into a laboratory. Thanks to the efforts of workers and technicians, the tool manufacturing department has manufactured iron pots, iron lamps, plowshares, and axles. The machine department has manufactured ginning machines, cotton carding machines, oil presses, textile machines, flour mills, bicycle parts, and other small machines. They are currently researching the manufacture of cigarette-making machines and button-making machines. The laboratory has begun to manufacture soap and is researching the manufacture of bleaching powder. All departments have officially started operations. The workers' production enthusiasm is extremely high. They expressed that they would produce more agricultural tools to help farmers carry out large-scale production and work even harder. The factory is calling on groups and individuals to invest in the factory to expand production. Currently, no less than hundreds of people come to the factory gate to purchase goods every day, and cars and rickshaws are constantly coming and going, making it extremely crowded.

　　The city's seven dyeing and weaving industries and seventeen paper mounting industries have also started operations one after another. Other small industries such as forty textile industries, leather making, soap making, and steel have all started operations. Tongxinxiang and other three mechanical egg factories, two match factories, and poverty alleviation factories are also actively preparing to resume work.

            Culture and Education

　　With the major recovery of industry and commerce and the improvement of people's lives, cultural and educational undertakings have also been launched. Bookstores and printing industries have resumed operations one after another. The Jining Daily was launched on May 1st. Due to the difficulty of manpower and machinery, it will temporarily be published in two pages. After several months, when the offset printing machine and editorial staff are complete, it can be published daily. Currently, there are three middle schools in the city, with more than 2,000 students, nine complete primary schools, twenty-four junior primary schools, and one normal school with more than 6,000 students. In order to carry out the cultural education of the people, a municipal library, a people's education center, a public sports field, a vocational school, a reading room, and the reform of old dramas have been established.

            Transportation

　　Since peace, Jining City's transportation construction has become increasingly developed. Highways and postal services are unblocked in all four directions. Since the establishment of the bus station, the number of passengers on each route has increased daily. The three buses to Tai'an daily have more than one hundred passengers. There are also daily buses to Heze, Juancheng, and Jiaxiang, which are also very crowded. The business income for this item in March was more than 450,000 yuan, and in April it increased to more than 1,000,000 yuan. The Jiji (Tengxian), and Jixu (Xuzhou) lines are being rushed to be repaired, and several sedan cars and small sleeper cars have been added to run on various lines. City buses will start soon. Since the merger of the China Post Office and the Transportation Bureau, the number of incoming and outgoing mails has surged. In April alone, more than 141,800 incoming letters and more than 131,700 outgoing letters were received. The mails sent to Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places have all received return letters and receipts.

            Municipal Administration

　　The citizens of this city, under the enemy and puppet's eight years of bloody exploitation, have been devastated and persecuted, and many have fallen into a state of hunger and cold. After liberation, our democratic government allocated hundreds of thousands of catties of grain to relieve the disaster areas in Chengdong and Nanguan, which were looted and burned by the traitor Liu Bengong, and more than 14,470 poor citizens. All the affected areas have been completely restored, and a new atmosphere of peaceful construction is overflowing everywhere. The suffering citizens have built their new homes on the rubble. The municipal government, in order to prosper the market and tidy up the city, has established a municipal construction committee to prepare to open up more new markets and local product markets in Southeast Guan. Garbage cans are set up everywhere on the streets, large and small. Every day, street cleaners sweep, daily tidy up public toilets, give citizens vaccinations, and adjust well water prices. Strengthen relief work and renovate the original disability homes, porridge factories, homeless shelters, blind people's public offices, orphanages, and kindergartens with huge sums of money. And with 400,000 yuan to repair the Taibai Tower, which was destroyed by the great traitor Liu Bengong. City parks, municipal auditoriums, and match companies, and other large and small shopping malls are also under preparation.

            Newborn People

　　In Jining's grain firms, livestock firms, grass firms, cloth firms, and other markets, the bosses and managers sitting in the accounting rooms or standing in front of the counters are no longer those glaring adults. Instead, they are members of various levels who have turned over and are managing the market. They resolutely oppose bad people who seek personal gain and engage in corruption. These newborn people, after becoming masters, have eradicated unscrupulous acts of corruption and extortion. Poor people all have food to eat. Before liberation, there were sixty families on Wensheng Street alone who ate bean cakes and tree leaves, moaning in hunger all year round. Now, even the worst life of every poor citizen has enough sorghum noodles and some wheat noodles. Many people can be seen on the street changing into new clothes. Mud mason Guo Hongxiang said, "This is the first time I have worn new clothes in eight years." Wang Zhaotai excitedly said, "In the past, I pulled a cart all day and couldn't even earn enough to eat. I had to go hungry on rainy days. Now, not only is it enough for the whole family to live on, but there is also surplus grain to do business." These poor people who have turned over are all boasting about their good times of democracy and freedom. Cui Desheng happily told reporters, "Comrades: Quickly publish our lives in the newspaper so that people everywhere know that in our place, the poor have come forward and the bad people have all become good. For example, Zhang Baolin of Wensheng Street used to be a puppet soldier, smoked opium and drank alcohol, and often beat and scolded his mother. Since the Eighth Route Army came, he has reformed." In this new group of people, there are no more idlers, hooligans, or local bullies.

　　欣欣向荣的济宁市
    济宁市位于山东省的西南部，冀鲁豫区的东端，为津浦铁路兖（州）济支线的终点及兖济，济荷（泽），济金（乡），济东（阿），济郓（城）诸公路之中心，运河流经城南，水陆交通都极方便，是鲁西南二十余县之政治、经济、文化中心。全市共有大小街道四百六十余条，人口有十五万之多，为全边区第一大城市，为鲁省第二大城。在敌寇占领期间，曾遭受百般摧残，因此元气大丧，自被八路军于今年一月九日解放后，在民主政府积极实行民主建设，繁荣工商业，减轻人民负担，兴办教育的施政方针下，虽仅历时四月，而全市已呈欣欣向荣的新气象，现将近况介绍于后：
            商业
    经过敌寇汉奸八年的压榨统治，济宁市的各种商业异常萧条，全市大小商店倒闭了百分之八十以上，冀南银行济宁支行发放了大批商业贷款，仅四月份商业贷款数额即达一千四百六十一万二千元，各种商业迅速恢复。现已有大小商号四千余家恢复营业，组织了四十三种同业公会。全市各业以皮业为主，鲁西、豫北、苏北二十余县的毛皮都集散于此，战前滑子皮每年可出口四百万张，全市五十家皮行，敌人来后，全部倒闭，目前恢复大宗交易的已有二十家，每天可输出毛皮一万张左右，共值洋七万万元，战前的羊毛交易，当春毛上市时，每天能上七八十万斤，估计今年可恢复战前的一半。其次要算是粮食的交易了，特别是小麦，汶上，金乡，鱼台等小麦产区所产小麦，也都于此集散，现全市共有四个大粮场，其中之一的巴口粮场就有十个大粮行，每日可售出粮食三百石。第三为牲口的交易，从东北来的牲口，也都经过这里；每日可成交三百八十头，合洋四百七十万元，土布的交易，每天达六百万元。商局曾召开全市工商界座谈会，宣布民主政策的经济，免除了各种苛捐杂税，并共同研究出工商建设的方针，现在，八年来不敢进城的老百姓都赶到城里来做买卖，市面愈益兴盛起来。
            工业
    济宁市的工业在工商局与晋冀鲁豫贸易总公司济宁第四分公司的扶助下也迅速恢复，电灯、面粉、火柴、蛋厂、铁工等数十家较大的工厂都先后开工。
    电灯公司在济宁解放的当天晚上，马达声就隆隆的响起来了，使黑暗而死寂的济宁城变成了光明辉煌的城市，该厂现有三百六十匹马力的发电机两部，二号锅炉一座，在全厂职工整夜的努力工作下，可供全市二万三千盏电灯的电力。工人除努力本位工作外，他们正准备修水管子卖水，并经营电料行作为业余生产，此外，公司的盈利，他们还可对半分红。
    济丰面粉公司在政府的资助下，于四月十日正式开工，现由归济丰先生代表该厂故主刘竹樵与政府订立合同，共同经营，共有资本七千万元（冀钞），日出面粉四万斤，一俟机器修好后，即可日出八万斤，不但可供本市的需要，还可销售于济南、徐州、北平、天津各大城市。全市原有的几家铁厂，敌人在时，大都制造火药等武器，抗战胜利后，边区军工业开始转向制造生产工具，军区军工部即将济宁军火工厂改为工农业制造厂，将原来的翻沙部改为农具制造部，机械部改为机器制造部，火药电气部改为化验部。由于工人和技师的努力，工具制造部已制造铁锅、铁灯、犁滑、车轴，机器部已制出了轧花机，弹花机，轧油器，纺织机，磨粉机，自行车零件等诸小型机器，现正在研究制造卷烟机，制造纽扣机。化验部已开始制造肥皂，并在研究制漂白粉，各部都已正式开工。工人生产情绪高涨万分，他们表示要多生产农具帮助农民进行大生产，更加倍的工作。厂方为扩大生产正号召团体及私人向该厂投资。现该厂大门前每日来往购货者不下数百人，汽车，人力车等车辆络绎不绝，拥挤异常。
    本市的七家染织业与十七家纸糊业，亦都相继开工。其他如四十家纺织业，制革、肥皂、钢铁等的小型工业均已开工。同新祥等三家机器蛋厂，两家火柴厂以及贫民工厂也正在积极筹设复工。
            文教
    随着工商业的大部恢复，人民生活的改善，文教事业亦已开展，书店、印刷业都纷纷复业。济宁日报已于五月一日创刊，由于人力机器的困难，暂出两版，俟数月后对开机及编辑人员齐备后，可日出一报。现全市共有中学三所，学生二千余人，完小九所，初小二十四所，师范一所共有学生六千多人。为开展民众的文化教育，特设立市立图书馆，民众教育馆，公共体育场，职业学校，阅报室，并改良旧剧。
            交通
    济宁市的交通建设，自和平后，日益发达，公路，邮政四处畅通。自汽车站成立以来，各线乘客日增，每天开往泰安的三班汽车，乘客有百余人之多，到荷泽，鄄城，嘉祥均每日有车，乘客亦甚拥挤。三月份此项营业收入为四十五万余元，而四月份已增至一百万元以上。现在正赶修济滕（县），济徐（州）两线，并又增加了轿式汽车与小卧车数辆行驶各线，市内公共汽车不日即可开始。自中华邮政局与交通局合并后，来往邮件数量激增，仅四月份内共收进口信十四万一千八百多件，出口信十三万一千七百余件，所发京、沪、平、津、汉口、川、桂等各地邮件均已收到回信与回执。
            市政
    本市的市民，在敌伪八年血腥剥削下，备受摧残迫害，多陷于饥寒交迫之境，解放后，我民主政府即拨粮食数十万斤，救济城东，南关遭汉奸刘本功抢劫焚烧的灾区及贫苦市民共一万四千四百七十余人。现各被灾区已全部修复，到处洋溢着和平建设的新气象，受难的市民们已在瓦砾堆上建造了自己的新居。市府为了繁荣市场，整理市容，成立了市政建设委员会，准备在东南关开辟更多的新市场和土货商场。大小街道遍设垃圾箱，每天清道夫洒扫，每日整理公共厕所，给市民注射防疫针，调整井水价格。加强救济工作将原有之残废院，粥厂，寄流所，盲人公所，育儿院，幼稚园都以巨款加以整顿。并以四十万元重修被大汉奸刘本功捣毁的太白楼。市内公园，市府大礼堂以及火柴公司等大小商场也均在筹设中。
            新生的人们
    在济宁的粮行，牲口行，草行，布行等市场坐在账房里或站在柜台前的老板，经理们，已再不是那些横眉竖眼的大人先生了，而是翻身后各级会员来管理市场，他们坚决反对营私舞弊的坏人。这些新生的人们，当了主人后，贪污敲诈的不轨行为是根绝了。穷人都有了饭吃，未解放前，只文盛街就有六十家吃豆饼，树叶，整年整月在饥饿中呻吟着，而现在每个贫苦市民最坏的生活，也有足够的高粱面和一些麦面，在街上可以看见许多人换上了新衣，泥水匠郭鸿祥说：“八年来我是第一次穿新衣裳。”王兆泰兴奋的说：“俺过去拉车子一天混的不够一天吃，阴雨天就得挨饿，现在不但够全家生活，还有余粮做买卖。”这些翻身后的贫民都夸耀着自己过着民主、自由的好时光。崔得胜高兴的对记者说：“同志：快把我们的生活都登到报上吧，叫各地的人都知道知道在我们这里穷人都出头了，坏人也都变好了。象文盛街张保林曾当伪军，吸白面喝酒，常打骂母亲，自八路军来后，他就改邪归正了。”在这个新生的一群中，已没有了游手好闲的光棍、流氓和地痞。
