　　[Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 20th] The two Huai salt region, the largest salt field in China, accounts for more than 22 percent of the country's total salt production and supplies salt to over 120 million people. The Huainan salt field (located south of the old Yellow River) was recovered by our army as early as 1941. The Huaibei salt field (located north of the old Yellow River) was only recovered by our army in September of last year. During the eight years of occupation, all production tools such as power plants, water pumps, windmills, waterwheels, channels, gates, reservoirs, evaporation ponds, etc., were completely destroyed by the enemy, and most of the salt farmers fled. After our recovery, the Suwan Border Region Government immediately ordered banks to lend huge sums of money, approximately 3 billion legal tender, to carry out repairs. To date, all production tools have been purchased, and all salt fields have been restored, creating a completely new atmosphere. Work is now underway to dredge the (salt) canal, build drying yards, construct barracks extensively, and replenish shipping docks. Salt farmers who fled during the occupation have returned one after another. Because living conditions have improved and production morale is high, the brine taken in with the tide this year has doubled compared to previous years. Spring sweeping has already begun, and the new salt is snow-white in color and large in grain. The average sodium chloride content is over 90 percent.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 20th] The famous Changlu salt滩 located on the Bohai coast north of Ninghe County. Since eastern Hebei was liberated from the enemy and puppets by the Eighth Route Army last August, loans have been issued, salt workers' lives have been improved, and scientific management has been implemented, resulting in very good conditions. It is estimated that 100 million jin of salt can be produced this year. The main part of the salt滩 is the Hangu salt滩, which includes 34 villages, is over 40 li long, over 20 li wide, and has a total area of approximately 1,750 mu, with over 370 salt灘s. Tens of thousands of salt farmers work here. Before being destroyed by the enemy, it could produce 300 million jin of salt annually, which was transported by sea and land to Tianjin and Hebei and Shanxi provinces. In recent years, it has plummeted. Since the Eighth Route Army liberated the area, the entire salt滩 has been managed by the salt affairs management office established by the democratic government, which is determined to operate it well, help salt farmers organize self-defense groups, and lent each worker 25 jin of millet at the end of last year. Wages have also increased from 12 jin of millet to 16 jin of millet per day. Salt households and workers have signed labor contracts. As workers' lives have improved, production efficiency has also increased. Currently, except for a portion that was destroyed by the Japanese invaders and cannot be opened, 215 have resumed salt production. The Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Government allocated a loan of 50 million border currency (equivalent to 100 million legal tender) and established four sales offices, a saltpeter bureau, and a fish bureau. Three sales offices have already started selling salt, and people come here to transport salt every day in an endless stream. In order to quickly rectify salt affairs and make it an enterprise, the salt affairs office specially organized a salt industry company, solicited private shares, helped old salt households produce salt, and helped workers establish cooperatives to solve shopping difficulties. On September 30 last year, the Kuomintang reactionaries suddenly attacked with a large army and occupied Sai Shang, the center of the Hangu salt灘, occupying two-tenths of it, and 10,000 salt farmers were plunged back into misery. Under the Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes, each "qing" of salt costs a minimum of 30 yuan, more than three times the salt price in the liberated areas. When salt households pass by, they are extorted 20 yuan in legal tender by the Kuomintang army as a toll. The people are suffering terribly. On April 21 this year, the Tianjin Kuomintang authorities sent Zhang Xuwu and He Qiwu to negotiate "takeover" again. Upon hearing the news, the people immediately rose up in opposition. The Kuomintang reactionaries, with their insatiable greed, sent 320 more troops disguised as salt police to Sai Shang on April 27 and 28, attempting to extend their evil hands into the entire salt滩. The Jidong Eighth Route Army authorities have issued a solemn statement that if the Kuomintang army dares to invade the salt灘, the Eighth Route Army and over 100,000 people will resolutely defend themselves.

　　民主政府发放巨大贷款
    恢复两淮长芦二大盐场
    产盐将可供两万万以上人口食用国民党蓄意破坏盐滩我将坚决自卫
    【新华社淮阴二十日电】我国第一大盐场两淮盐区，占全国食盐总产量的百分之二十二强，供给食用人口在一万万二千万人以上，其淮南盐场（位于旧黄河以南的），早于三十年为我军收复，淮北盐场（位于旧黄河以北的），于去年九月间始为我军收复。在沦陷八年中，所有生产工具如发电厂、吸水机、风力、水车、沟道、闸门、蓄水池、蒸发池等等，均被敌人破坏无遗，盐民大部逃亡。我收复后，苏皖边区政府，即饬令银行贷放巨款约合法币三十亿元，从事修复，至目前为止，全部生产工具，业已购置齐备，所有盐田，均已修复，气象一新。现正兴工疏浚运（盐）河，建立晒场，普遍建立营房，添补轮船码头。在沦陷期间逃亡的盐民，均纷纷迁回，因现在生活改善，生产情绪颇高，故今年以潮水取进之卤汁，较往年增加一倍。春扫现已开始，新盐色泽雪白，颗粒亦大，平均氯化钠含量均在百分之九十以上。
    【新华社遵化二十日电】位于宁河县北渤海之滨的我国著名长芦盐滩，自去年八月冀东为八路军从敌伪手中解放后，即发放贷款，改善盐工生活，并加以科学管理，情形极为良好，预计今年可产盐十万万斤。该盐滩中主要为汉沽盐滩，包括三十四个村庄，长四十余里，宽二十余里，总面积约一千七百五十多顷，有三百七十多个盐滩。数万盐民在此从事劳作。在未被敌人破坏之前，年可产盐三十万万斤，由海陆两路运往平津及冀、晋各地。近数年来，即一落千丈。自从八路军解放后，整个盐滩由民主政府设立盐务管理处，锐意经营，帮助盐民组织自卫团，去年年底贷给每个工人小米二十五斤，工资亦由每天小米十二斤增至十六斤。灶户与工人订立劳资合同，工人因生活改善，生产效率随之提高，现除被日寇破坏的一部分尚不能开滩外，已有二百一十五个恢复产盐。晋察冀边区政府拨贷款边币五千万元（折合法币一万万元），设立了四个推销处，一个硝磺局，一个鱼局，现已有三个推销处，开始卖盐，每日来此运盐者，络绎不绝，为了迅速整顿盐务，使之企业化，盐务处特组织盐业公司，招集私股，帮助旧有灶户制盐，并帮助工人成立合作社，解决购物困难。去年九月三十日，国民党反动派，竟突然以大军袭击，占领了汉沽盐滩中心塞上整个盐湾，被其占去十分之二，有一万盐民，重陷苦海。在国民党苛捐杂税下，每擎盐最低为三十元，超过解放区盐价三倍以上。当盐户过路时，即被国民党军勒索二十元法币的买路钱，人民痛苦不堪。今年四月二十一日，天津国民党当局又派张旭武、何其文前来谈判“接收”，人民闻讯，即一致起来反对。国民党反动派贪心不死，遂于四月二十七、八两日，伪装盐警，在塞上增兵三百二十余人，企图将魔手伸入整个盐滩。冀东八路军当局，为此已发出郑重声明，若国民党军胆敢侵犯盐滩，八路军与十余万人民，将坚决自卫。
