　　Following the implementation of the policy of public assistance for privately run schools,
    Taihang Elementary School Achieves Remarkable Results.
    Truly achieving the masses running it themselves, with leadership not acting arbitrarily.
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] Since the Taihang area proposed the policy of public assistance for privately run schools in 1944, significant achievements have been made. In Zuoquan, privately run elementary schools account for two-thirds, and in Shexian, one-third. After individual senior primary schools in Yushe and Zuoquan were run privately, they were managed very well. Currently, Changzhi and Lucheng have decided to fully implement private operation starting in May. Licheng, in particular, has done a comprehensive job and achieved results. In Ren Village, this county, during the transition to private operation, model volunteer teachers patiently carried out propaganda, and the masses discussed and raised capital themselves through shareholding to solve funding problems. They also allotted labor proportionally, cultivating four mu of grain and one mu each of cotton and hemp (all public land) to provide teachers with food, clothing, and miscellaneous expenses. The masses are very concerned about the elementary school. All fifty-seven school-age children in the village are enrolled. The teachers are also in high spirits, teaching during the day and helping with people's schools at night, while the masses voluntarily cultivate the teachers' family land. Qiupo Village sold temple property to raise funds for running the school and purchased school farmland. The masses in Lang Village put forward the slogan "Relying on the mountains to run the school," with the whole village going up the mountain to chop firewood and sell it for money, earning 11,500 yuan in two instances, successfully solving the school's expenses. Changning Village created "Labor Exchange Elementary School," hiring local villagers as elementary school teachers and having the masses cultivate their land in exchange. In other areas, such as the newly liberated areas of Changzhi, after the masses reduced rent and overturned the old system, they urgently demanded that their children become literate and educated, voluntarily contributing the fruits of their struggle to organize schools. According to reports from various places, there are several experiences in transitioning to private operation: (1) It should not be simply viewed that "public assistance for privately run schools" is for saving expenses; it is necessary to enlighten the masses' thinking and should start from the needs and willingness of the masses. Some areas have ordered private operation based solely on fiscal considerations, causing the elementary schools to collapse. (2) To truly run the schools for the masses, extensive deliberation and discussion should be carried out among cadres, the masses, teachers, parents, and enthusiastic educators in society, and they should be organized to practically participate in school leadership. (3) It is not about abandoning leadership; one should always check and resolve specific difficulties. (4) Yushe has a mass organization called the Private Education Committee, which absorbs cadres, teachers, children's representatives, and enthusiastic educators from society. It elects directors through popular election, assigns specific tasks, and regularly publishes accounts. Many counties also frequently hold parent-teacher conferences and exhibitions to solicit opinions from the masses and report on their work to the masses.

　　执行民办公助方针后
    太行小学获显著成绩。       
    真正做到群众自己办，领导上不自流。
    【本报长治讯】太行各地小学，自四四年提出民办公助的方针以来，现已获显著成绩。左权民办小学已达三分之二，涉县也有三分之一，榆社、左权个别高小实行民办后，办得很好，目前长治、潞城已于五月份起，决定完全民办。特别是黎城，做得普遍，而有成绩，该县仁庄村小学，在转民办中，经模范义教耐心宣传，群众自己讨论集股投资，以分红解决经费问题；并按分抽工，种谷四亩，棉、麻各一亩（都是公地），供给教员吃穿及杂支。群众对小学十分关心，全村五十七个学龄儿童，全部入学，教员情绪也很高，白天上课，夜间帮助民校，群众自动代教员耕种家里地。楸坡村变卖庙产，筹集办学基金，购买学田。榔庄群众提出“靠山办学”口号，全村上山砍柴卖钱，两次即获利一万一千五百元，学校开支顺利解决。长凝村创办“变工小学”，聘请本村人当小学教员，群众给他代种地。其他如新区长治等地群众减租翻身后，迫切要求子弟识字读书，自动拿出斗争果实，组织学校。据各地反映，转入民办中有这样几个经验：（一）不能单纯认为“民办公助”是为省经费，必须启发群众思想，应从群众需要与自愿出发。有些地区则因单纯财政观点，命令民办，致使小学转垮。（二）要做到真正是为群众来办学校，应在干部、群众、教员、家长及热心教育的社会人士中进行广泛酝酿讨论，组织他们实际参加学校领导。（三）不是放弃领导，应随时检查解决具体困难。（四）榆社有民办教育委员会的群众组织，吸收干部教员儿童代表及社会热心教育人士参加，经过民选举董事，具体分工，定期公布账目。不少县份并经常举行恳亲会，展览会等，征询群众意见，向群众报告工作。
