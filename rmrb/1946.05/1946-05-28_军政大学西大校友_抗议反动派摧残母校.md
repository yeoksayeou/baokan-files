    Protest Reactionaries' Destruction of Alma Mater
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Xu Yuqi, Yang Tao, Jia Xun, Li Kai, Fang Fuqing, Xu Xinxian, Li Zhenqi, and other former National Northwest Associated University students now studying at the Military and Political University here, are extremely indignant at the armed suppression of their alma mater's students by the Kuomintang reactionaries. They have jointly sent a letter to express their condolences and support. The letter stated: "We were forced by special agents to leave Northwest University one after another, but we are always thinking of the arduous struggle you are waging for freedom and democracy. Now, just as we are living a life of democracy and freedom, we feel indescribable indignation upon hearing that you have been subjected to armed suppression by the Kuomintang reactionaries." The letter continued: "Here we have witnessed the emergence of a new, democratic, and free China. Therefore, you are by no means alone. The liberated areas and the youth and people of the whole country are your backing. Students, advance bravely!"
