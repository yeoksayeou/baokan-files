　　Transforming Prisons into Schools
    Jinnan Prefecture Establishes Self-Renewal Institutes
    Prisoners Engage in Production and Study; No Escapes in Wucheng County
    [Our newspaper, Weixian dispatch] In order to strengthen the management of criminal offenders and educate and reform prisoners' thinking, the Jinnan Administrative Office has issued a circular to all levels of government judicial organs to establish Self-Renewal Institutes. Self-Renewal Institutes have now been established or are being established in various counties to accommodate prisoners sentenced to more than one year of imprisonment (those sentenced to less than one year will be supervised by village residents in village prisons). Each institute has a director and a clerk. Prisoners are not subject to restraints; minor offenders can move freely, while serious offenders are only allowed to move indoors. Their families are free to visit. Prisoners are divided into groups, and group leaders are democratically elected by the prisoners themselves to lead the prisoners in production and study. Prisoners' livelihood is self-sufficient through production. The Jinnan Bank has provided a loan of one million yuan as a production fund for the Self-Renewal Institutes. The Self-Renewal Institute of the Fourth Prefectural Administrative Office's Judicial Section was established on March 20th and currently has twenty ordinary criminal offenders, divided into two classes with a total of four groups. They spend two hours each day on reflection and study, six hours on production, and the remaining time on free labor. The study focuses on current affairs, literacy, and education to inspire prisoners to consciously recognize their mistakes. In terms of production, three people are engaged in farming, planting 24 mu of cotton; 14 people are engaged in handicrafts such as weaving straw hats, carving wooden seals, painting, and adobe making. Cadres and prisoners jointly established a production committee to uniformly plan and lead production. Furthermore, prisoners at the Wucheng Self-Renewal Institute have also organized production groups for adobe housing construction, sheep herding, textile production, and salt extraction. In addition to improving their living standards, they have a surplus of 15,329 yuan. Since the establishment of the Self-Renewal Institutes, prisoner education has achieved great results, with no one escaping. This demonstrates the fundamental difference between prisons under the management of the democratic government and the dark and brutal prisons under the management of the Kuomintang.

　　把监狱变成学校
    冀南各专县设自新院
    犯人生产学习武城无一人逃亡
    【本报威县讯】冀南行署为加强对刑事案犯之管理，教育改造犯人思想，通令各级政府司法机关设立自新院。现各县已有建立完竣或正建立中之自新院，收容一年以上之徒刑犯（不满一年者在村监狱由村群众监督执行徒刑），内设院长，事务员各一人。犯人一律不带刑具，轻犯可自由行动，重犯只许在屋内行动，其家属可自由接见。犯人均划编小组，由犯人自己民主选出小组长，领导犯人生产学习。犯人生活由生产中自给。冀南银行已贷款百万元作自新院之生产基金。四专署司法科自新院是三月二十日建立的，现已有二十名普通刑事犯，编为两班，共四组，每天规定反省、学习各两小时，生产六小时，余时自由劳作。学习方面主要是时事、文化及启发犯人自觉认识自己错误的教育。生产方面现已有三人从事农作，种棉花二十四亩；十四人从事于编草帽、刻木章、绘画、脱坯等手工业，干部及犯人共同成立了生产委员会，统一筹划领导生产。又武城自新院犯人也组织了脱坯盖房、牧羊、纺织、淋盐等生产小组，除改善生活外，尚余一万五千三百二十九元。从自新院建立后，犯人教育收到很大的成绩，无一人逃跑，此即民主政府管理下的监狱，与国民党管理下的黑暗残酷的监狱有天地之别。
