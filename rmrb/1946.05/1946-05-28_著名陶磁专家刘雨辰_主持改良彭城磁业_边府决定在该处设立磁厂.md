　　【Our Dispatch】Pengcheng Town, in Ci County, is an important ceramics producing area in North China. Originally, there were over 200 ceramics kilns, and their products were sold in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei, and the Northeast provinces. Thus, it is popularly known as "Pengcheng for a Thousand Miles." However, due to the poor quality of raw materials produced there and the adherence to outdated methods from the Ming Dynasty until now, there has not been much improvement. Moreover, they are all coarse ceramics that cannot compete with porcelain goods from Tangshan, Jingdezhen, and other places. The Border Region Government's Department of Construction has decided to establish a ceramics factory there, with Deputy Director and Director of the Industrial Manufacturing Research Institute Liu Yuchen and Deputy Director Yang Jieren personally overseeing experiments and researching improvement methods: (1) Researching the quality of the clay produced there and the situation of indigenous manufacturing. (2) Blending and improving the unglazed pottery body and glaze. Personnel have already been dispatched to Taihang Zuoquan, Huguan, Licheng, Linxian, and other places to collect feldspar for experimentation. (3) Experimenting with "firing." The existing old kilns there all suffer from uneven temperature during "firing," not only consuming more coal but also resulting in significant losses, urgently requiring improvement to increase output, reduce costs, and improve quality.
    Note: Mr. Liu Yuchen is 62 years old and a renowned ceramics expert. During the Guangxu era, he studied in Japan and graduated from a higher industrial school (the predecessor of the Imperial University). In the first two years of the Republic of China, he served as the director of the Hebei Provincial Industrial Experiment Institute and the head of the Ceramics Department, as well as a ceramics lecturer in the Chemistry Department of the Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology. Only after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan did he resign and lead workers and students to our base areas to participate in the war of resistance and serve the people. During his more than 20 years in office, Mr. Liu has made significant achievements in the research and manufacture of chemical ceramics, glass, refractory materials, etc., and is a rare specialized talent.

　　著名陶磁专家刘雨辰
    主持改良彭城磁业           
    边府决定在该处设立磁厂
    【本报讯】磁县彭城镇，为华北重要产磁区，原有磁窑二百余家，其产品行销冀、豫、鲁、晋、鄂及东北各省，故俗有“千里彭城”之称，因该地所产原料不佳，且又墨守成法，从明朝直到如今，无多大改良，且均系粗磁不能与唐山、景德镇等地瓷货竞争，刻边府建设厅决在该处设立磁厂，由副厅长兼工业制造研究所长刘雨辰及副所长杨介人等亲自主持试验，研究改良办法：（一）研究该处所产陶土之品质，及土法制造情形。（二）素地（坯子）釉乐之调合与改良，现已派员赴太行左权、壶关、黎城、林县等地采取长石，以供试验。（三）试验“烧成”，以该处所有旧窑，“烧成”时均以火候不均，不仅耗煤较多，且损失甚大，亟需改进，以增加产量，减低成本，提高质量。
    按：刘雨辰氏现年六十二岁，为著名之陶磁专家，于光绪年间留学日本，毕业于高等工业学校（帝大前身），于民国元二年间，即任河北省工业试验所所长兼陶磁科长，及河北省立工学院化学系陶磁讲师，直至抗战爆发，始离职率领工人学生来我根据地参加抗战为人民服务，刘氏在职二十余年，对中国化学用磁及玻璃、耐火器材等之研究制造，均有重大成就，实为不可多得之专门人材。
