　　Kuomintang Authorities Act Against the Tide
    Promulgate Artist Registration Law
    Shanghai Theater Circles Will Protest with a Shutdown
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 25th] Shanghai News: After the Kuomintang authorities recently announced the implementation of the reactionary measure of "Artist Registration," it immediately aroused fierce opposition from Shanghai's theater circles. The Actors' United Association, the Entertainment Association, the Film Troupe, the Shanghai Drama Society, the Playwrights' Association, the Shanghai Art Theater, the Xinhua Drama Society, and seventeen other theater groups have jointly established the Shanghai City Theater Circles' Committee for Refusing "Actor Registration." They are requesting the government to immediately withdraw this absurd method that violates democracy and destroys personal freedom. If it is not rescinded, all cinemas, Peking opera theaters, drama theaters, Yue opera theaters, amusement parks, etc., will completely shut down to express their firm protest.
    [Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 25th] Shanghai News: In order to further deprive artists of their freedom, the Kuomintang authorities recently promulgated the so-called "Artist Registration" law through the Municipal Police Bureau. It stipulates that all theatrical figures in the city, whether in film, drama, Peking opera, or acrobatics, must obtain an "Artist Registration Certificate" in addition to their "National Identity Card." When obtaining the certificate, they must register, fill out a form, and attach a photo. The certificate has multiple rules, stating that artists must carry it with them for inspection at any time, and they are not allowed to perform on stage without a certificate. This certificate is the same as a license for dancing girls and prostitutes, and must be stamped at the police station once a month, otherwise, they will not be allowed to perform.

　　国民党当局倒行逆施
    颁布艺员登记法
    沪戏剧界将以停业抗议
    【新华社延安二十五日电】沪讯：国民党当局最近宣布实行“艺员登记”的反动措施后，立即引起沪市戏剧界的猛烈反对。伶界联合会、游艺协会、电影团、上海剧艺社、剧作者联谊会、上海艺术剧团、新华剧艺社等十七个戏剧团体，已于日前联合成立上海全市剧艺界拒绝“剧员登记”委员会，请政府立即收回这一违反民主，破坏人身自由的荒谬办法。如不取消，则全市的电影院、平剧院、话剧院、越剧院、游艺场等全体停业，以表示坚决抗议。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】沪讯：国民党当局为进一步剥夺艺人自由，最近由市警察局颁布所谓“艺员登记”法，规定全市戏剧界人士，不论电影、话剧、平剧、杂耍均须于“国民身份证”之外，再领“艺员登记证”一份。在领证时，必须登记、填表、帖照片。证上有规则多条，注明给艺员随身携带，以备随时调查，无证不得登台献艺等。该证与舞女娼妓执照相同，每月须到警局盖章一次，否则不准上演。
