    Postal Workers' Preparatory Committee Established
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch News] The border region's postal service work, thanks to the arduous construction by all employees over the past seven years, already has a considerable foundation. After the realization of peace, with active construction, it is developing even more rapidly. Currently, the border region has four administrative bureaus, one each in the Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji-Nan, Taiyue, and Taihang regions, as well as twenty-two branch bureaus, two hundred and one county and city bureaus, and one hundred and thirty-nine postal stations, totaling three hundred and sixty-seven units including the Border Region Postal Service General Bureau. The total length of postal trunk lines in the entire region is thirteen thousand and thirty-five li. In the Ji-Lu-Yu region alone, there are seven trunk lines, totaling two thousand and twenty-five li in length, with twenty-two postal stations established along each trunk line, and fifty-five branch lines, connecting seventy-two counties. The work efficiency of each trunk line has now exceeded the past by one to three times.
    [Another Dispatch] Over four thousand seven hundred postal workers in the border region, in order to organize themselves and dedicate themselves to the border region people's postal service undertaking, initiated the organization of a postal workers' union. The General Preparatory Committee of the Workers' Union was established in Handan on the first of this month, and it was decided to establish preparatory committee branches in various regional bureaus and branch bureaus, and to send representatives to formally convene the first workers' congress on August 1st to establish the General Union of Postal Workers.
