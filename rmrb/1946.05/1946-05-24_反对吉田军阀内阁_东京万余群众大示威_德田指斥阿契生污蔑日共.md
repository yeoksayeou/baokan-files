　　Opposition to the Yoshida Military Clique Cabinet
    Over Ten Thousand People Demonstrate in Tokyo
    Tokuda Accuses Acheson of Slandering the Japanese Communist Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Tokyo dispatch: Since Yoshida took office on the 16th, he has been constantly attacked by the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and various democratic parties, the broad masses of the people, and Japanese public opinion. After the JCP and various democratic parties led over ten thousand people in holding three demonstrations in one day on the 17th, the JCP issued a statement stating: Yoshida was once the Foreign Minister of the Tanaka Cabinet, and Tanaka personally formulated the plan for Japanese imperialism to conquer China and even the entire world. Therefore, we believe that the new cabinet is a military clique cabinet. The Mainichi Shimbun stated: We hope that the new cabinet members can faithfully represent the strength of all parties participating in politics.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Moscow's radio commentator Masinu commented today on the Tokyo trial of Japanese war criminals, stating: The defense attorneys are attacking the court with two aims: one is to attempt to delay the trial, at least by two months; the other is to attempt to prove that this court does not seem to have the right to try these criminals who oppose peace and endanger humanity, and does not seem to be able to equate them with the Germans. The Japanese lawyers have strong backing behind them, so they dare to take such vile and shameless actions. They want to turn the war crimes tribunal into a fascist platform for the Yamato nation, defending Japanese militarists, deceiving the people, in order to preserve their prestige and power among the people. The shameless behavior of the Japanese lawyers in court is closely linked to the activation of reactionary forces in Japan.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Acheson, the US representative to the Allied Council for Japan, issued a statement on the 15th, denouncing the protest letter submitted to the Council by the masses of the May 1st demonstration in Japan as "communist propaganda," and declaring: "The United States does not want to see communism appear in the United States or Japan." Tokuda, Secretary of the JCP, issued a solemn statement on the 16th, saying: The JCP and himself had long anticipated Acheson's statement, which is actually the inevitable result of the US's stance. Acheson's statement that the US does not want to see Japan implement communism will not cause any modification to the JCP's plan. Only the JCP can solve the food crisis in Japan, and the JCP's current goal is to establish a democratic Japan.

　　反对吉田军阀内阁
    东京万余群众大示威
    德田指斥阿契生污蔑日共
    【新华社延安二十日电】东京讯：吉田自十六日登台以来，就不断受到日共及各民主党派、广大人民以及日本舆论的攻击，日共与各民主党派于十七日领导万余人民，举行一日三起之示威后，日共又发表声明称：吉田曾是田中内阁的外相，而田中曾亲订日本帝国主义征服中国以至全世界的计划，因此我们认为新内阁是军阀内阁。每日新闻称：吾人望新阁人选，能忠实代表参与政事各党之实力。
    【新华社延安廿日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努评东京审判日本战犯称：辩护人问法庭进攻有二个目的，一是企图使法庭拖延审判，至少拖延二个月；另一是企图证明这一法庭，似乎没有权利审判这些反对和平，危害人类的罪犯，似乎不能把他们与德国人混为一谈。日本律师背后有坚固的靠山，因此敢于作这样下贱无耻的行动，他们想把审判战犯的法庭变成大和民族的法西斯主义的讲坛，为日本军阀辩护，欺骗人民，以保存他们在人民中的威信及势力。日本律师在法庭上的无耻行为，是与日本反动势力在国内的积极化有其密切的联系。
    【新华社延安二十日电】对日委员会美代表阿契生，十五日曾发表声明，对日本五一示威群众向委员会所提抗议书，污蔑为“共产党之宣传”，并宣称：“美国并不愿见共产党主义之出现于美国或日本”。日共书记德田十六日对此发表郑重声明说：日共及其本人，对阿契生之声明早已预料到，这实为美所持立场之必然结果。阿氏所谓美不愿见日本实行共产党主义一节，不能使日共之计划因此有何修正，在日本只有日共才能解决粮食危机，日共之当前目的为建立民主的日本。
