　　Southern Hebei First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts
    Peasants Universally Organize Farmers' Associations
    Wenxi Strengthens Ideological Education, Exposing Illegal Landlords' Conspiracy to Sabotage Mass Movements.
    [Our Correspondent in Weixian] Since Southern Hebei has boldly mobilized the masses, the political consciousness of the broad masses has been universally raised. Therefore, they urgently demand the establishment and consolidation of their own organizations to maintain the fruits of victory, organize to increase production, and strive to completely liberate themselves from poverty. In the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts, peasants in counties such as Qiuxian, Julu, and Jixian have universally established farmers' representative assemblies. In the Second District of Yuancheng County, after in-depth deliberation and "networking" by the masses, more than 1,500 people in thirteen villages spontaneously established farmers' representative assemblies, reflecting many of the masses' urgent desires. When the Seventh District was establishing its own organization, the peasants unanimously and enthusiastically participated in the election, on the spot exposing saboteurs who cast two votes, and discussed and decided on future work guidelines: (1) Handle all outstanding cases in the mass movement, such as factual basis, contracts, unity, and other issues. (2) Strengthen village-level organizations and consolidate mass armed forces. (3) Production should be based on agriculture, with the universal organization of mutual aid and cooperation to ensure that loans are used for production. After the meeting, thirty-two mutual aid groups were developed, greatly increasing production efficiency, and the fruit allocation problem was resolved in three days. Dishang Township in the Sixth District and Ma Township in the Fifth District have both served as key demonstration areas, gaining considerable experience and leading the work of the entire county. Guan County has entered a period of enthusiastic elections throughout the county. In the Fifth District, ten villages have universally established village farmers' associations, which have raised issues such as preventing spies and promoting production, submitting them to county farmers' association representatives. After the elections in each district, the county-level farmers' association was established on the 27th of last month, solving many important problems.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng, 22nd] The mass movement in Wenxi has achieved great results, with 70% of the villages in the county having been mobilized. However, during the movement, it was discovered that reactionary elements and stubborn landlords were sabotaging the mass movement. After the struggle was launched, some secret agents and illegal and domineering landlords, in order to shift the target of the struggle, disintegrate peasant unity, and regain the fruits of peasant victory, engaged in inciting disunity among the peasants, such as using large villages to oppress small villages, or main villages to oppress attached villages, provoking antagonism among the peasants of various villages. Furthermore, the right-wing rulers within the villages, in order to achieve their personal aims, induced and coerced peasants to participate in the struggle, resulting in infighting among the peasants in the villages. In addition, because the leadership initially did not focus on educating mass cadres, and the ideas of localism and sectarianism were not eliminated, the schemes of the domineering landlords found an opportunity to exploit. The leadership has now exposed this conspiracy and quickly carried out ideological education on "Farmers of the world are one family." Under this new awareness, the masses in various villages have begun to unite and wage a joint struggle against the instigators. This shift, through the struggles of advanced villages, has influenced and driven backward villages, playing a significant role.

　　冀南一、三、四、五分区
    农民普遍组织农会
    闻喜加强思想教育，揭穿非法地主破坏群运阴谋。
    【本报威县讯】冀南放手发动群众以来，广大群众政治觉悟普遍提高，因此急迫要求建立与巩固自己的组织，以保持胜利果实，组织起来增加生产，争取从穷困中彻底解放自己。一、三、四、五各分区的邱县、巨鹿、冀县等县的农民已普遍建立了农民代表会，元朝县二区经过群众深入酝酿和“串连”，十三村一千五百余人自动建立了农民代表会，会上反映了许多群众的迫切愿望。七区在建立自己组织时，农民一致热烈参加选举，当场检举了投两票的破坏分子，并讨论决定了今后工作方针：（一）处理群运中一切悬案，如果实、文契、团结等问题。（二）健全村级组织，巩固群众武装。（三）生产以农业为主，普遍组织互助合作，保证贷款用于生产。会后，互助组发展了三十二个，生产效率提高很多，果实问题在三天就处理完毕。六区的堤上小区，五区的马小区，都作了重点示范，得到不少经验，带领了全县工作。冠县全县都进入了热烈选举。五区有十个村普遍建立了村农会，纷纷提出防奸生产等各方面问题，交与县农会代表。各区选完后，上月二十七日建立了县级农会，解决了很多重要问题。
    【新华社阳城廿二日电】闻喜群运已获很大成绩，全县百分之七十的村庄，已发动起来。但在运动中，发现反动分子及顽固地主破坏群运，当斗争发动后，一些特务分子及违法恶霸地主，为转移斗争目标，瓦解农民团结，夺回农民胜利果实，即进行煽惑鼓动农民内部不团结，如利用大村欺压小村，或主村欺压附村，挑拨各村农民的对立。又如村内右派统治者，为了达到其私人企图，诱胁农民参加斗争，结果形成村内农民的倾轧。此外，由于领导上开始对群众干部教育未抓紧，本位主义、宗派主义的思想未清除，也使恶霸地主的阴谋达到可乘之机。现领导上已将此阴谋予以戳穿，并迅速进行了“天下农民是一家”的思想教育，各村群众，在新的觉悟下，已开始团结起来，向挑拨者进行联合斗争，这一转变，通过先进村的斗争，影响带动落后村，起了重大作用。
