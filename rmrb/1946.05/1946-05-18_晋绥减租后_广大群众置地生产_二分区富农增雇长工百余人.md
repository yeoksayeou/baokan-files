　　After Rent Reduction in Jin Sui
    The Broad Masses Acquire Land and Produce
    Rich Peasants in the Second District Employ Over a Hundred Long-Term Laborers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 14th] In various areas of the Jin Sui Second District, the enthusiasm for production is universally high among all strata. The broad masses of poor people are vying to buy land after rent reduction. In Xigou Village, Pianguan, over twenty families bought two hundred and forty mu of good land. Rich peasants in various areas have increased the employment of over one hundred and seventy long-term laborers. Over ten landlords in Hequ, such as Zhang Chengye and Yu Hongjue, have actively turned to agriculture and industry to develop production after rent reduction. The six counties of Hequ, Baode, Pianguan, Shenchi, Wuzhai, and Kelan have collectively purchased over two thousand head of livestock, and the masses are paying more attention to fertilizing cultivated land. In Hequ Chengguan, two hundred and twenty-eight households collected over twenty thousand cartloads of manure in half a month. In Wuhuacheng Village, the amount of oil cakes purchased for fertilizing fields increased from thirty thousand jin last year to eighty thousand jin this year. The price of each small cart of manure has risen from thirty yuan to one hundred and twenty yuan. The masses' enthusiasm for production this year is higher than in previous years. In the past half month, activities such as planting cotton, weaving textiles, repairing water conservancy facilities, and engaging in transportation have been more enthusiastic than in previous years.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 11th] In areas where rent reduction and rent investigation are continuing in depth during the spring plowing, the masses are enthusiastically engaging in large-scale production. In villages such as Huangshuihe and Anzishang in Guoxian County, the masses redeemed over two hundred and fifty mu of land and distributed over a hundred mu of temple land. After more than forty poor peasant households received food rations, they immediately joined nearby villages such as Beiwuzhuang to flood over ten thousand mu of land and repair a canal that can irrigate three thousand mu of land. In the third district of Fangshan, after rent investigation and protection of tenancy, according to statistics from three villages, one thousand mu of wasteland have already been reclaimed. In Huajiapo Village, fourteen hired laborers used increased funds to buy cattle and organized two labor exchange groups to take turns going up the mountain to reclaim wasteland. Zhang Chuyuan, the creator of combining labor and armed forces to protect production in Ningwu County, started the rent investigation movement in Shibeibao by first solving the food and seed difficulties of poor peasants. At the same time, he organized labor exchange teams and reformed twelve hooligans to participate in production. In Wenshui, after breaking the cadres' idea that "there is no rent to reduce in the plains," the rent reduction movement in central villages such as Xiahuizhen, Shuizhai Village, and Beixindian has been launched. Yongle Village expanded its cultivated land by one hundred and sixty mu, and cotton planting increased several times compared to last year. In Renyan Village, Fenyang, ninety laborers organized labor exchanges after rent reduction, and women also organized labor exchange groups to plant cotton and develop household textiles. After the victory of rent reduction and wage increase in Fengzhen, labor exchange teams have been organized in over eighty villages. After the first district of Yubaigou won the struggle against the local tyrant Ni Shuanggui, over two hundred laborers and forty head of livestock in the entire village participated in the labor exchange team. In Lixun Village, after rent reduction, landlords and tenants jointly built canals. After rent reduction in Gongyong Village, Xingning, the area of cultivated land was expanded by over one thousand one hundred mu this year, and many hired laborers were able to obtain land and become independent farmers.
