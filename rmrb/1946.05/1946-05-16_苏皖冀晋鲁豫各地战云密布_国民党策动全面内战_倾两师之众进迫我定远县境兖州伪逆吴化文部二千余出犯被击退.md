　　War Clouds Gather in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan
    Kuomintang Plots All-Out Civil War
    Two Divisions Press Our Dingyuan County Border; Rebel Traitor Wu Huawen's Troops from Yanzhou (2,000 Strong) Attack and Are Repulsed
    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Military news received by this agency today indicates that Kuomintang troops are engaging in military actions in the Central Plains, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong, making the situation very tense. Furthermore, the situation is also at a stalemate in the front lines of Sipingjie. (1) In the Northeast, Sipingjie is still being firmly defended by the Democratic Allied Army. The defense of the city has lasted for 25 days, with the entire line in a state of deadlock. Zheng Dongguo is personally督战 at the front lines, but is unable to change the situation. Currently, the Kuomintang authorities are increasing the deployment of reinforcements. (2) Along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui, Kuomintang troops are frequently mobilizing between Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Taixing, actively planning to attack the Jiangsu-Anhui border region. The entirety of their 73rd Army is concentrated near Pukou on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, while their 48th Army's 18th Division and 49th Army's 38th Division are pressing towards Dingyuan, in the Fourth Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui region. The units of their 49th Army's 79th Division have been reinforcing defenses southwest of Jingjiang City along the river. General Su Yu, Deputy Commander of the Jiangsu-Anhui Military Region, issued a statement, pointing out the severity of the situation and calling on the people of the whole country to stop the Kuomintang troops' attacks. (3) In Central Hebei, Kuomintang troops and puppet troops in Cangzhou, Qingxian, and Yangliuqing on the Jinpu Railway, and in Shijiazhuang, Zhengding, and Xincheng on the Pinghan Railway, are launching frequent attacks, attempting to encircle the Central Hebei liberated area from both the east and west. (4) In Shanxi, Yan Xishan successively summoned Wang Jingguo, Zhao Chengzhou, and others to Yuci for military meetings, arranging for a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas. Two divisions of Yan's troops in central Shanxi are concentrated in Taiyuan City as mobile forces, ready to depart at any time. More than 6,000 Japanese troops have been reorganized by Yan into four special service regiments and are still stationed along the Tongpu Railway. (5) More than 2,000 troops of Wu Huawen, a rebel from Yanzhou, attacked east of Yanzhou City on the 5th, but were repulsed by our army. (6) Kuomintang troops continue to invade the Central Plains Military Region. The Queshan security regiment occupied Shigun River, west of Queshan, on the 5th and continued to advance south towards Wagang.
    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Kuomintang troops near Yang(zhou), Tai(zhou), Jing(Nanjing), and Zhen(jiang) have been frequently mobilizing and actively making deployments, awaiting orders to attack our liberated areas. The Kuomintang 25th Army stationed in Yangzhou was transferred to Taizhou on the 6th and 7th. The newly arrived Kuomintang troops in Zhenjiang and Nanjing are continuously moving north to Yangzhou. South of the Huagi Camp (near Jiangpu) station on the Jinpu Railway, the Kuomintang army has concentrated the entire 73rd Army and the 18th Division of the 48th Army, which are pressing towards the Dingyuan County border in the Fourth Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region (i.e., the western liberated area), constructing field fortifications. Furthermore, the 235th Regiment and 337th Regiment of the 79th Division of the Kuomintang 49th Army, after reinforcing Jingjiang City on the 18th of last month, reoccupied our Xingang on the 26th and reinforced Ba＠gang (southwest of Jingjiang City along the river) on the 28th, actively building fortifications. All ironware from all blacksmith shops in Jingjiang City was seized to manufacture military equipment, and the wheat seedlings of residents near Ba＠gang, Xingang, Xieqiao, and other places near Jingjiang City and along the roads were cut down. Under the looting of the Kuomintang army, more than 80,000 people in the suburbs of Jingjiang City are currently without food. The government of the liberated area allocated 20,000 jin of grain for disaster relief.
