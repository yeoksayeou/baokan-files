　　Jiaohe and Other Counties in Jilin
    Enemy-Occupied Land Distributed to Poor Workers and Peasants
    The Government Ensures Their Land Rights and Issues Land Certificates.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 18th] In Jiaohe County, Jilin, over 14,000 hectares of paddy and dry land previously seized by the enemy and puppet regime have been fairly distributed to poor peasants, hired laborers, impoverished military families, and unemployed workers in various districts. Their land rights have been confirmed, and land certificates have been issued. In the Taijian District of Jilin City, more than 200 hectares of paddy and dry land confiscated from the puppet "Minsheng" and "Zhenxing" cooperatives have been allocated to 40 poor peasant households, benefiting 392 people, with 257 of them receiving three mu each. Thirty-five hectares of land belonging to Wang Yiqing, a notorious Japanese special agent in Jilin, have been distributed to 25 landless peasant households. The 273 houses have also been distributed to poor people for residence. In Tonghua County, during rent reduction, the Farmers' Association, based on a standard of three mu of vegetable land or six mu of paddy field per laborer, distributed land seized by the enemy to landless poor people throughout the street. Celebrating their liberation, they enthusiastically joined the Farmers' Association. In Zhen'an Village, Chengfeng County, Liaobei Province, 29,743 mu of enemy and puppet land were distributed to 998 households, comprising 4,774 landless or land-poor individuals, averaging slightly more than six mu and two fen per person. This ensures that a family of three or four can secure food and clothing as long as they cultivate diligently. After the land distribution, significant changes have occurred in the class composition of the village. Originally, hired laborers accounted for 35 percent and poor tenant farmers for 60 percent; now, they have all become self-cultivating farmers. Previously, middle peasants who relied entirely on renting enemy and puppet land and engaged in sideline occupations have partly become prosperous middle peasants.

　　吉林蛟河等县
    敌占土地分给贫苦工农
    政府确保他们的地权，发给土地执照。
    【新华社长春十八日电】吉林蛟河县，过去被敌伪吞并之一万四千余垧水旱地，已公平分配给各区贫雇农，贫苦军属及失业工人，并确定他们的地权，发给土地热照。吉林市泰间分区被没收之伪民生，振兴合作社二百余垧水旱田，已分配给该区四十户贫农受益者三百九十二人，其中有二百五十七人，每人分得三亩。吉林著名日本特务王仪清的三十五垧地，已分给二十五户无地农民。房屋二百七十三间，又分给贫民居住。通化县农会于减租中，按照一个劳动力分菜地三亩或水田六亩的标准，将被敌侵占去的土地分给全街没地种的贫民，在欢庆翻身中纷纷加入农会。辽北省成丰县镇安村二万九千七百四十三亩敌伪土地，分给无地或少地的九百九十八户，四千七百七十四人，平均每人分得六亩二分强。这样只要勤于耕种，一家三四口衣食都可确保无虞。该村分完地后，乡村阶级成分已发生很大变化，原来占百分之三十五的雇工与百分之六十的贫佃农，现在都成了自耕农。以前全靠租种敌伪土地并兼营副业的中农，一部分已成为富裕中农。
