　　Ji'ning, Daming, and Eleven Other Counties
    Anti-Traitor Movement Launched One After Another
    Over 80,000 People Involved in the Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan] A fervent anti-traitor, revenge, and reckoning movement has successively unfolded in the Ji-Lu-Yu and Ji'nan regions. In the six counties of Ji'ning, Tai'an, Wenshang, Heze, Gaoling, and Zhangqiu in the Ji-Lu-Yu area, over 50,000 people have participated in the movement. In Ji'ning, under the eight years of enemy and puppet rule, the masses' thinking was deeply affected by poison. Therefore, the entire county first launched a propaganda movement to draw a clear line in the masses' thinking. In half a month, 208 villages involving over 10,000 people joined the movement. The masses recovered their seized interests from the hands of traitors and local bullies, totaling 400,9218 jin of grain, 1,237 mu of land, 2,423,650 yuan of Lu currency, and other items such as salt and matches. In the Shu district of the county, in just seven or eight days, 55 villages with over 4,000 people organized themselves in the movement. The Tai'an grievance-airing and revenge movement, after 5,000 people in villages around Xiazhang at the end of last month jointly settled blood debts with the bandit and local bully Wu Wuwu, has unfolded intensely. On the 3rd of this month, 16,000 people in Wenshang, in a joint action, publicly tried the puppet county magistrate Cao Ziting. Before the public trial, a large-scale parade and demonstration were held. The masses participating in the meeting fully recognized their strength. After returning to their villages, they actively guided the movement in their villages. In Heze city, thousands upon thousands of people have jointly publicly tried war criminals such as Sun Huafeng. The masses in the Zhucun area of Gaoling County are also jointly launching a reckoning struggle against the puppet Bao chiefs. For heinous traitors, the democratic government, accepting the demands of the masses, has imposed the death penalty according to law. The masses, after airing their grievances and taking revenge, are continuing to show rising enthusiasm for the reckoning struggle. In the five counties of Fudong, Daming, Baixiang, Weixian, and Xia in the Ji'nan area, the anti-traitor and revenge movement among the masses in the newly liberated areas is also developing fiercely like a prairie fire. Nearly 30,000 people from all walks of life have participated in the struggle, adopting forms such as joint struggles and public trial meetings, to air their grievances against over 20 traitors. With the support of the democratic government, the broad masses who have suffered untold torment have washed away eight years of blood debts. On April 15th, Fudong convened a public trial meeting of 10,000 people to reckon with the major traitors Liu Jinyue and Li Zhenbo. The heinous Liu Jinyue had led the enemy in countless "sweeps," helping them capture over 130 of our workers. Then, the traitor Li Wencheng was brought forward, who fled to the Kuomintang-controlled area and was not only not punished but also became an official. The masses expressed their firm opposition to the Kuomintang's shameless behavior. In Baixiang, 2,000 people from 13 villages in the first district jointly struggled against five die-hard traitors, including Geng Fengwen. At the meeting, the masses wept bitterly, recounting eight years of grievances. On April 18th, in Daming, 7,000 citizens conducted a reasoning struggle against the traitors Yuan Tingde and Dan Lü'an. An old lady in her sixties and a child of thirteen both cried out in pain. On April 29th, thousands of people in the first district of Xiajin publicly tried the traitor Meng Xijiu. Over the past eight years, he had amassed a fortune by plundering the masses, acquiring over 140 mu of land and buying five houses, extorting over 16 million yuan from the people. This time, a thorough reckoning and compensation were carried out. Villages such as Qijizhen in Weixian also launched a joint struggle against traitors such as Li Buzhou. The democratic government, listening to the demands and opinions of the masses, has lawfully implemented punishment and execution for these traitorous culprits.
