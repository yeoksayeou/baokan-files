　　Border Region Actively Develops Transportation
    Constructs Highways and Telephones
    [This City News] In order to facilitate communication between the military and civilians, the Border Region Government has decided to immediately erect long-distance telephone lines along the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section of the Pinghan Railway. Due to the shortage of wires and telephone poles, it has specifically ordered all counties and cities to be responsible for promptly collecting, purchasing, and storing them within their respective districts and villages. It has also ordered its subordinate units to report the collected quantities to the Construction Department of this government or the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section of the Pinghan Railway Administration within half a month upon receipt of the order, whereupon personnel will be dispatched to assess prices and conduct acceptance inspections. Furthermore, the counties should immediately arrange for the preparation of 3,300 telephone poles according to the dimensional standards within twenty days of receiving the order, to facilitate the project.
    [This City News] In order to develop transportation and repair the highways along the Pinghan Railway, the Border Region Highway Administration convened a meeting on May 5th and 6th, bringing together construction section chiefs and construction assistants from Shahe, Yongnian, Handan, and Ci County, along with the deputy director of the Border Region Highway Bureau and road administration personnel, totaling twenty-two people. Detailed discussions were held on specific matters such as road repair policies, engineering tasks, and contracting, and various implementation methods were decided upon.
