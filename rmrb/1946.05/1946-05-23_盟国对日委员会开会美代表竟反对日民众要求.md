　　Allied Council for Japan Meeting: US Representative Actually Opposes Japanese People's Demands
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Tokyo dispatch: During the Allied Council for Japan meeting on the 15th, regarding the letter from Japanese demonstrators on May Day to the Allied Council for Japan (note: the letter protested unreasonable rice control, opposed the suppression of labor, and demanded the rights to freedom of speech and assembly), the Soviet representative advocated discussing the matter. The US representative, Acheson, believed that the letter contained signs of communist propaganda and that the council should not support it. The British representative, Ball, interjected, saying, "Assuming that the Communist Party is legal in Japan, then it has the right to conduct propaganda." Acheson then said, "MacArthur Headquarters will investigate whether the matters listed in the letter are facts," and asked the Soviet representative how he knew that everything stated in the letter was "fact." The Soviet representative countered by asking Acheson how he knew it was not a fact, and stated that the letter represented the opinions of the 600,000 people who participated in the May Day demonstration in Tokyo. The Soviet representative then proposed changing "reportedly" in the record to "fact," to which the British representative also agreed.

　　盟国对日委员会开会美代表竟反对日民众要求
    【新华社延安十九日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会于十五日开会时，在关于五一节日本示威群众给对日委员会的信（按该信抗议无理的米粮统制，反对镇压劳工，要求言论集会的权利）的问题上，苏联代表主张讨论此事，美代表阿契生认为该函含有共产党宣传的标志，委员会对此不应支持。英代表鲍尔插言说：“假设共产党在日本是合法的，那么它就有权利进行宣传。”阿契生又说：“麦克阿瑟总部将调查该函中所列举的事情，是否是事实，”并询问苏代表如何知道信中所说均为“事实”；苏代表反问阿契生，怎样知道不是事实，并称该信代表了参加东京五一节示威的六十万人的意见。苏代表乃提议将记录中的“据说”改为“事实”，英代表亦同意。
