　　Yoshida Reactionary Cabinet Formed
    Newspaper Predicts New Cabinet's Fate Will Be Short-Lived
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Tokyo Dispatch: The Yoshida Shigeru cabinet was officially formed at 7 p.m. on the 22nd. The entire list of cabinet members has been approved by MacArthur. In addition to Yoshida Shigeru, the president of the Liberal Party, serving as Prime Minister, he also holds the posts of Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Demobilization of the Army and Navy, and Director of the Central Liaison Office (an institution specializing in liaison with MacArthur Headquarters). In addition, the Minister of Home Affairs is Oomura Kiyoshi (formerly Vice-Minister of Home Affairs in the Shidehara Cabinet), the Minister of Finance is Ishibashi Tanzan (a member of the Liberal Party, president of Toyo Keizai magazine), the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is Wada Hiroo (formerly Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Administration Bureau of the Shidehara Cabinet), the Minister of Commerce and Industry is Hoshijima Niro (one of the leaders of the Liberal Party), the Minister of Communications is Hiratsuka Tsunejiro (Liberal Party, close to the Mitsui Zaibatsu), the Minister of Health and Welfare is Hamai Yoshiaki (formerly Vice-Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Shidehara Cabinet), the Minister of Justice is Kimura Tokutaro (formerly Chief Prosecutor), the Minister of Education is Tanaka Hidetaro (Director of the School Education Bureau of the Ministry of Education in the Shidehara Cabinet). Shidehara openly serves as Minister of State (without portfolio) in the new cabinet, and the other two Ministers of State are Matsudaira Yoshichi of the Progressive Party and Uehara Etsujiro of the Liberal Party (a veteran of the Seiyukai party, a friend of Inukai Tsuyoshi, and a well-known pro-American figure). Abe Mikishi, from the Mitsubishi financial group, remains as President of the Reconstruction Agency.
    Looking at the overall picture of the new cabinet lineup, the new cabinet is an anti-democratic cabinet led by the Liberal Party, an extension of the Shidehara Cabinet, dominated by politicians raised by the Mitsubishi financial group, and a financial cabinet allied with Mitsui politicians. Therefore, it is a purely Japanese militaristic cabinet representing the interests of the financial groups.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] Tokyo Dispatch: Newspapers predict a bleak future for the Yoshida cabinet. Major newspapers believe that its achievements will be extremely limited, and the fate of the cabinet will not be long-lasting. Yomiuri and Hochi criticize the Yoshida cabinet as weak and powerless, and in fact the new cabinet is not a cabinet at all. According to a Shanghai dispatch: Tang Jinna (transliteration), a commentator for Shanghai Radio, commented on the composition of the new Japanese cabinet: "The Yoshida new cabinet was produced with great difficulty because the old fox Shidehara was unwilling to give up power. Shidehara refused to recommend Katayama to be Prime Minister because if Katayama became Prime Minister, Shidehara would not get such an important position in the Yoshida cabinet. The new cabinet will also pursue the reactionary policies pursued by Shidehara." The author also stated: "Yoshida has helped the Japanese warlord clique invade China, so he is an invader, and the invader is our enemy."

### 吉田反动内阁组成  日报预测新阁命运不长

　　吉田反动内阁组成
    日报预测新阁命运不长
    【新华社延安二十六日电】东京讯：吉田茂新阁，已于二十二日下午七时，正式成立全部阁员名单已由麦克阿瑟批准，新任自由党总裁吉田茂任首相外，尚兼任外务省大臣，陆军及海军复员省大臣和中央联络局（专司与麦克阿瑟总部联络之机构）局长等职。此外，内务省大臣大村清（原为币原内阁内务省次官）、大藏省（即财政部）大臣石桥湛山（自由党党员，东洋经济杂志社社长）、农林省大臣和田广雄（原为币原内阁之农林行政局长）、商工省大臣星岛二郎（自由党首脑之一）、递信省（即交通部）大臣平冢常次郎（自由党，接近三井财阁）、厚生相（社会福利部）大臣含良成（曾为币原内阁农林省次官）、司法大臣木村笃大郎（曾任检查长）、文部省大臣田中秀太郎（币原内阁文部省学校教育局长）、币原公然出任新阁的国务（不管部）大臣，另外二个国务大臣为进步党的松定吉一和自由党的植原悦二郎（过去政友会的元老，犬养毅的教友，著名的亲美人物）。本届复兴院总裁仍由三菱系财阀阿部美树志留任。
    综观新阁班子的图景，新阁乃是自由党领衔的反民主内阁，是币原内阁的延长，是以三菱系财阀豢养的政客占优势，与三井系政客合伙的财阀内阁，因而它是清一色的日本军国主义的，代表财阀利益的内阁。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】东京讯：日报纸预测吉田内阁前途黯淡，各大日报认为其成就将极有限，而内阁之命运亦不至久长。读卖、报知抨击吉田内阁，柔弱无力，事实上新阁并非一内阁。另据上海讯：上海无线电评论员唐金纳（译音）对日本新阁组成评称：“吉田新阁在极大难产中产生，乃是因老狐狸币原不愿放弃政权，币原拒绝推荐片山出任首相，因为如果片山当了首相，币原便得不到在吉田内阁中那样重要位置了。新内阁也将奉行币原所奉行的反动政策”。作者并称：“吉田曾帮助过日本军阀集团侵犯中国，因此他是一个侵犯者，而侵犯者就是我们的敌人”。
