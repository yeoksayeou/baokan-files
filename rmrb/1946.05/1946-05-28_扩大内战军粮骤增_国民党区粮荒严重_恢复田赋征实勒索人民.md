　　Expanding Civil War Leads to Sharp Increase in Military Grain Demands
    Grain Shortages Severe in Kuomintang Areas
    Resumption of Land Tax Collection in Kind Exploits the People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th Dispatch] According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 20th, Minister of Food Xu Kan reported at the Kuomintang Government Memorial Week that the current grain situation is extremely difficult, resulting in only one-third of the planned purchase of 74 million shi of food grain last year being completed so far. Xu also stated that in accordance with the resolution of the Second Plenary Session, the method of collecting land tax in kind will be continued, and the Executive Yuan has decided to implement it from July 1st.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th Dispatch] Grain shortages are severe in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and the authorities are adopting a "robbing Peter to pay Paul" approach, transporting grain from Jiangxi, Anhui, and Sichuan, which are also suffering from famine, to other provinces. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 20th, Minister of Food Xu Kan stated in his report at the Kuomintang Government Memorial Week that 2 million shi of surplus grain from Sichuan over the years will be used to assist the downstream provinces, 500,000 shi of grain from Jiangxi's reserves will be used to assist the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, and 1.8 million shi of grain will be purchased in Anhui and transported to grain-deficient areas. Furthermore, according to a special Nanjing dispatch in the World Daily on the 15th, Xu Kan admitted at a press conference on the 14th that "the biggest reason for the grain shortage is the excessive amount of military grain."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th Dispatch] Chongqing News: In the midst of widespread famine in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the Kuomintang reactionaries, disregarding the life and death of the people, recently transported 5,600 tons of military grain to the Wuhan area under the pretense of disaster relief to carry out the civil war. It is reported that 100,000 tons of military grain will be transported from Sichuan every month in the future.

    【新华社延安二十四日电】国民党统治区粮荒严重，当局采用剜肉补疮办法，将同样闹着灾荒的江西、安徽和四川的粮食运赴他省。据中央社南京二十日讯：粮食部徐堪在国府纪念周之报告中称：将四川历年余粮之二百万石接济下游各省，将江西存粮之五十万石接济京沪各地，在安徽购粮一百八十万石运赴缺粮地区。又据十五日世界日报载南京专电称：徐堪在十四日记者招待会上，承认“粮荒原因，军粮太多为最大者”。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】渝讯：国民党统治区，遍地灾荒声中，国民党反动派却不顾人民死活，最近在渝假借救灾名义，运送军粮五千六百吨，到武汉一带进行内战，闻今后将每月由川运出军粮十万吨。
