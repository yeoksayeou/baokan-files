　　MacArthur Disregards Public Opinion
    Japanese Communist Party and Public Opinion Criticize
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd Dispatch] Tokyo dispatch: Since the "May Day" holiday until the 19th, the Japanese people have held more than nine demonstrations, demanding the establishment of a democratic government and the solution of the increasingly serious food problem. Allied Commander MacArthur ignored these demands, and after the large demonstration of 250,000 people on the 18th, suddenly issued a statement on the 20th to stop the mass movement of the Japanese people, stating: "The unruly elements (?), now beginning to employ tangible acts of intimidation, should not be allowed to continue for long," and stating: "If the minority elements (?) in Japanese society no longer exercise self-control and self-respect, I will have to take necessary steps to manage them."
    After MacArthur's statement was issued, the Japanese Communist Party and public opinion criticized it. A Communist Party spokesperson stated: "The demonstration is a united movement of all organized workers." Asahi Shimbun stated: "A certain prominent political figure believes that MacArthur's statement is an 'edict,' and the term 'edict' is only used when the Japanese Emperor announces issues."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd Dispatch] Tokyo dispatch: Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the May Day Executive Committee, organized by representatives of ten labor unions, submitted a statement to the Allied Council on the 21st, denying that the letter given to the Allied Commander-in-Chief by the committee chairman Acheson on May Day (note: the letter protested against the Allied Headquarters' suppression of the demonstration movement and urged the Japanese government to update its food distribution, etc.) was not written by Japanese hands. It also accused Acheson of not being familiar with Japanese customs, stating: Chairman Acheson believes that the May Day letter is unreliable because the letter was not signed. However, it is a Japanese custom that a letter from a gathering does not require individual signatures. The letter was drafted by Kobayashi of the News and Postal Workers' Union, approved by the Executive Committee on April 27th, and read to 500,000 union members gathered at the Imperial Palace Outer Garden on May Day, and the resolution was passed. Acheson claims that the various examples in the May Day letter are unreliable. We declare that all these examples are facts. As long as the Allied authorities conduct an investigation, the truth will come out. We hope to take the necessary steps for this."

　　麦克阿瑟漠视民意
    日共及舆论予以批评
    【新华社延安二十二日电】东京讯：日本人民自“五一”节迄今十九日止，共举行过九次以上的示威运动，要求建立民主政府及解决日益严重粮食问题，盟军统帅麦克阿瑟对此要求忽视不顾，而十八日二十五万人大示威后，忽然于二十日发表阻止日人群众运动的声明称：“目无纪律分子（？），现在开始采用之有形威胁行为，不许其长此继续”，并称：“如果日本社会的少数分子（？）不再自制自重，我将不得不采必要步骤加以管理”。
    麦氏声明发表后，日共及舆论均予以批评，共产党发言人称：“示威是一切有组织工人的联合运动”。朝日新闻称：“某著名政界人士对麦氏之声明认为麦克阿瑟之‘敕令’，而‘敕令’一词，只是日皇宣布问题时之用语”。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】东京讯：在日共与社会党领导下，代表十个劳工联合会所组织的五一执行委员会，于二十一日送交他们对日委员会声明书一件，否认该会主席阿契生所谓五一节交给盟军统帅部的函件（按该函系抗议盟军总部压制示威运动，及促日本政府更新其粮食分配等），不是出之日本人手笔，并指责阿契生不熟悉日本的生活习惯，内称：阿契生主席认为五一函件不可靠，因该函件未经签名。殊不知一个集会的函件，不用签个人的名子，原是日本的习惯。该函件为新闻邮电工人联合会人员小林所起草，于四月二十七日经执委会批准，并向五一节集会于皇宫外苑的五十万工会会员宣读，而被通过的决议案。阿契生称五一函件中各种例证不可靠，我们声明，这些例证全部是事实。只要盟国当局进行调查，就可水落石出。我们希望能为此采取必要步骤。
