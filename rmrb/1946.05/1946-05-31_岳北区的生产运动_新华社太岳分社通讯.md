　　Production Campaign in Yuebei District
    Xinhua News Agency Taiyue Branch Communication
    The production campaign in Yuebei this year, like other places, is primarily faced with the difficulty of a shortage of labor and livestock. After eight years of devastation by the enemy and puppets, and the slaughter and conscription by Yan's army, Yuebei's labor and livestock have greatly decreased. According to a survey of Qinyuan, Anze, Qin County, and Tunliu counties, there are a total of 1,915,969 mu of land, with only 90,803 full laborers. Based on a standard of 18 mu of land cultivated per laborer, 366,814 mu of land will be left uncultivated due to lack of manpower. In terms of livestock, there are a total of 32,096 cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses, equivalent to 16,043 yokes. Based on 80 mu cultivated per yoke, there is still a shortage of 3,632 yokes, meaning that 289,884 mu of land cannot be cultivated due to lack of livestock. The shortage of livestock along the Tongpu Railway has always been severe, and the looting by stubborn troops has made the difficulties even greater than in Qin, An, and Tun counties. Secondly, the prevalence of epidemics and the increase in diseases have made the labor shortage even more acute. According to statistics from 18 natural villages in Tunliu (in March), 595 people suffered from nutritional deficiency. In Jiazhai Village, Anze, almost all children suffered from nutritional deficiency. Often, one person's illness requires the entire family to care for them, and some are not cured by doctors, causing extreme anxiety among the masses and reducing their enthusiasm for labor. In addition, Yan's army frequently attacks the liberated areas along the Baijin Railway, which greatly affects production in the border areas. In terms of the masses' ideology, due to insufficient ideological education in the mass movement, and the rumors and sabotage by special agents and landlords, some of the masses are ideologically confused and lack enthusiasm for production. Some even dare not boldly develop themselves, but take pride in being poor. A poor peasant in Jindui Village, Anze, bought a few mu of land, and people said when they saw him, "You are having a good time again!" He was startled. He often thought that if one family had a bad influence on him, it would be better to eat, drink, and be merry."
    In order to overcome the above obstacles to the production campaign, the leading organs in Yuebei implemented the following methods to promote production: (1) Organize mutual aid production and mobilize a large number of semi-laborers to participate in production. Qinyuan has implemented this plan better. They specifically determined the organization of mutual aid in each village at 30% to 80% and the organization of women and children semi-laborers at 20% to 50% according to the work base and needs. According to the inspection of the third li of Beiyuan Village, 22 of the 35 male full laborers were organized, accounting for 88% of the total, and 7 of the 15 semi-laborer women were organized, accounting for 46% of the total. Eight of the 12 children were organized, accounting for 66% of the total. In Xiaozhang Village, semi-laborers are responsible for delivering manure and plowing. The mutual aid group of women Guo Jinying and Guo Wan'e relies entirely on them to do the work of ten families. In the villages along the Langwei River, one can see full and semi-laborers in various forms of mutual aid every day. In terms of livestock adjustment, more than 60 mule and horse fairs were held throughout the region to buy and sell livestock, which greatly alleviated the severity of the livestock shortage.
    (2) Launch an epidemic prevention campaign. The special commissioner's office has issued an order to each county to hold doctor symposiums to study symptoms and sources of disease, exchange experience, and organize medical commando teams to treat the masses. Tunliu is a model for implementing this work. They organized doctors to promote epidemic prevention and various symptoms and treatments at various meetings (cadre meetings, mass meetings, labor hero meetings, etc.). Under the leadership and promotion of model doctor Gao Guang, dozens of medical commando teams were organized to provide home treatment. They also merged many pharmacies and resident doctors into medical cooperatives, extracting doctors and primary school teachers to compile teaching materials and songs about symptoms, sources of disease, and treatments, and used schools, night schools, and noon schools to carry out publicity. At the same time, it was stipulated that infants under the age of seven must be buried after death (local customs consider burial to be unlucky), abandoned bones on Laoyeshan were immediately buried, and sellers of medicines were prohibited from substituting fakes for genuine products or inferior products for superior ones; therefore, the disease has been reduced and deaths have decreased. Model doctor Li Kerang of Anze and doctor Hu Zhao of Qinyuan treated more than 30 children with nutritional deficiency within a month. All localities have achieved results and are continuing to fight the disease.
    (3) Conduct extensive and in-depth policy education to clarify ideological confusion. The method to solve this problem is to first carry out education among cadres at all levels (especially village cadres). In Qinyuan, the question of "Do we dare to get rich? What is the revolution for?" was discussed in depth among cadres and the masses. In Qin County, Song Deyuan, a new-style rich peasant, was used as an example to mobilize people. In Anze, the "New-style Rich Peasant Village" in Lijia Gou, District 3, was used as educational material (the village has a total of seven households, all of whom were tenant farmers before the war. Now, all are rich peasants, and each family hires long-term workers (hired workers and shepherds). There are a total of nine, as well as seven cattle, two donkeys, seven mules, and 370 sheep. All laborers in the village are organized for mutual aid production). Cadres to the masses, activists to backward elements, from the basic masses to the upper-class members of society were all educated. Other counties are doing the same. Proverbs such as "Exploiting money is like water, boats. Money earned by sweat and blood lasts ten thousand years." are used to stabilize the well-to-do households that have not been subjected to feudal exploitation. During the education, the general mood of the masses has gradually stabilized, which has powerfully promoted the production campaign.
    In areas where production is the main focus, how to use breaking through one point to promote the overall situation, while also centralizing production work, is an important link for leadership at present. Yuebei's solution to this problem is as follows:
    (1) Organizations at the special district and county levels establish production committees, with the government as the main body, and absorbing production and sales companies, banks, joint committees, and labor heroes to participate. Their main task is to study guidelines and plans, inspect work, and organize forces. Its main leadership content is mutual aid groups and cooperatives, unifying the organization and use of administrative, organizational, and economic forces to thoroughly implement the guidelines and plans.
    (2) Each level of the special district, county, and district determines base points, allocates key personnel, gains experience, and promotes the overall situation. The special district, county, and district determine regular contact at each level to discover typical examples as the backbone and bridge to promote the overall situation. The implementation of this method is better in Qinyuan and Anze. Qinyuan selects base points based on typical examples and major problems that need to be solved in each region. They work with the special commissioner's office to use Beiyuan in District 1 as a base point, mainly to obtain experience in organizing semi-laborers and livestock to promote the villages on both sides of District 1 and the Second Qin Avenue. The county government combines with District 4 to use Dinghu in District 4 as a base point, mainly for the purpose of creating experience in combining agriculture and sideline production to promote Districts 3 and 4 (because the local sideline products are abundant). The county government combines with District 5 to use Chishi Bridge as a base point, mainly for the purpose of obtaining experience in mobilizing middle peasants to participate in mutual aid to promote District 6 and parts of Districts 5 and 7 (because 80% of the area is middle peasants). In addition to this, each district has base points to gain experience in promoting local work. At present, various meetings (symposiums, cadre meetings, etc.) or briefings and visits are being used to promote the base point experience and other typical examples to the overall situation.
    (3) Organizational work. Organize forces to ensure the thorough implementation of this method. The special commissioner's office first extracted 15 cadres from various departments and distributed them to various counties to participate in labor hero symposiums to understand problems, summarize typical examples, and help formulate guidelines and plans. Based on the problems reported after returning to the office, 15 more cadres were extracted and distributed to various counties to help solve problems and promote work (the Tongpu District focuses on water conservancy and takes Pingyao as the key point. The Baijin District focuses on combining mass movement and production and takes Tunliu as the key point. The Qin'an District focuses on production and takes Qinyuan as the key point). Each department (except the Construction Section) promoted departmental work by doing central work, and each county implemented this spirit. According to the materials already obtained, Qinyuan has thoroughly implemented this spirit. In addition to retaining more than ten cadres to persist in office work and agricultural production, it extracted 19 cadres to go deep into the base points to help inspect and stipulate that they report back to the county every half month, summarize problems, study work, and exchange experience. This leadership method is also specifically implemented in the village. For example, in Beiyuan Village, the cadres responsible for the regime, the joint committee, and the armed committee jointly organized a production committee, and all other cadres were organized to participate in mutual aid groups, leading by households and doors, so that each cadre had a clear position and specific tasks, and each cadre vowed to achieve three satisfactions: that is, the work is good and the superior is satisfied, the style is good and the masses are satisfied, and the production is good and the family is satisfied. Therefore, the work speed is very fast, and the cadres also feel relaxed and happy. According to the above situation, the current organization of male and female full and semi-laborers to implement the production campaign is still continuing.

　　岳北区的生产运动
    新华社太岳分社通讯
    岳北今年的生产运动，和其他各地一样，首先摆在运动面前的是劳畜力缺乏的困难。岳北经过八年敌伪的摧残以及阎军的屠杀抓丁后，人畜力大减，据沁源、安泽、沁县、屯留四县调查，共有土地一百九十一万五千九百六十九亩，全劳力只有九万零八百零三个，每个劳力以耕地十八亩为标准，则三十六万六千八百一十四亩地将因无人力而致荒芜。在畜力上共有牲畜牛、驴、骡、马三万二千零九十六头，合一万六千零四十三犋，每犋以耕八十亩计，尚缺乏牲畜三千六百三十二犋，即是说尚有二十八万九千八百八十四亩地无畜力耕种。同蒲沿线畜力向来缺乏，加之顽军抢劫其困难更甚于沁、安、屯诸县。其次瘟疫流行，病害激增，致劳力更感缺少，据屯留十八个自然村的统计（三月间），患糠症者五百九十五人，安泽贾寨村几乎所有小孩害糠症。常因一人有病全家看守，有些竟延医不治，使群众情绪极为不安，劳动劲头也就不大，加以阎军经常向白晋沿线解放区进攻，更大大影响边沿区的生产。在群众思想上由于群众运动中思想教育不够，及特务地主造谣破坏，一部分群众思想混乱，生产情绪不高，有的甚至存在不敢大胆发展自己，反以贫为荣。安泽金堆村某贫农买了几亩地，人们见了说：“你又好过啦！”他便吃惊。常想一人家对他影响不好，还不如大吃大喝了好些”。
    为克服以上生产运动上的障碍，岳北领导机关便实行了下列几种推进生产的办法：（一）组织互助生产，并大量动员组织半劳力参加生产。沁源执行这一计划较好，他们按工作基础和需要具体的确定了各村组织互助百分之三十至八十，妇女儿童半劳力组织百分之二十至五十，据北园村第三闾检查，男全劳力三十五个组织起二十二人，占全数的百分之八十八，半劳力妇女十五人，组织起来的七人，占全数的百分之四十六。儿童十二人，组织起来的八人，占全数的百分之六十六。小章村送粪打茬都由半劳力去做。妇女郭金英，郭万娥互助组，十人家中的活全靠他们作。狼尾河沿岸各村，每天都可看到全半劳力各种互助在一起劳动。在畜力调剂上，全区举行了六十个以上的骡马大会买卖牲畜，这样大大减轻了畜力缺乏的严重性。
    （二）开展防疫运动，专署已通令各县举行医生座谈会，研究病状病源交流经验，组织医疗突击队为群众治病。屯留是执行这一工作的模范，他们组织医生在各种会上（干部、群众、劳动英雄等会）宣传防疫和各种病状，治法，在模范医生高光领导推动下，组织了几十个医疗突击队登门疗病，并把许多药铺和坐柜医生合并，医药合作社，以抽出医生小学教员把病状病源和治方编成教材和歌曲，利用学校、夜校、午校进行宣传。同时又规定七岁以下的婴儿死后必须埋（乡俗认为埋后不吉），立即掩埋老爷山遗弃骨骸，并禁止各卖药者以假代真以劣顶优；因之病势见减，死亡减少。安泽模范医生李克让和沁源医生胡照一月内治小孩糠症三十余个。各地均有成绩，目前仍继续和病魔作斗争。
    （三）广泛深入的进行政策教育，澄清思想上的混乱。解决这一问题的方法，首先从各级干部（尤其是村干部）中进行教育，在沁源把“我们敢不敢发财，革命为了什么”？在干部中群众中进行了深入的讨论。在沁县以新式富农宋德元为范例进行动员，安泽以三区李家沟“新式富农庄”为教育材料（该庄共七户，战前皆佃农，刻下均为富农，家家皆雇长工，（雇工和牧工）共有九个，还有七头牛，二条驴，七头骡，三百七十只羊，全庄所有劳力都组织互助生产），由干部到群众，由积极份子到落后分子，从基本群众到社会的上层分子中全都进行了宣传教育，其他各县都在这样做。又利用俗语如“剥削钱、水、船。血汗钱，万万年。”来安定未受封建剥削的小康户。教育中一般群众情绪都逐渐安定，有力的推动了生产运动。
    在以生产为主的地区，怎样运用突破一点推动全面，而又使生产工作中心化，是领导上当前一个重要的环节。岳北对这个问题的解决办法是这样的：
    （一）专县各级组织生产委员会，以政府为主并吸收产销公司、银行、联委会、劳英参加，其主要任务是研究方针计划，检查工作，组织力量。其主要领导内容是互助组，合作社，把行政力量组织力量经济力量统一组织使用，以彻底贯彻方针计划之实施。
    （二）专、县、区各级均确定基点，重心配备，取得经验推动全面。专、县、区确定各级经常联系，以发掘典型为推动全面之骨干和桥梁。这一方法的执行，以沁源、安泽较好，沁源以各地区典型和需要解决的重大问题选择基点，他们和专署结合起来，以一区之北园为基点，主要是取得组织半劳力和畜力经验，推动一区及二沁大道两岸各村。县府和四区结合起来以四区定湖为基点，主要目的为创造农业和副业结合的经验，推动三、四区（因该地副产富），县府和五区结合起来，以赤石桥为基点，主要目的为取得动员中农参加互助经验，以推动六区及五、七区部分村庄（因该地百分之八十为中农）。除此以外，各区均有基点，取得推动地方性的工作经验。目前正利用各种会议（座谈会、干部会等）或通报，参观等方式，把基点经验和其它地区典型向全面推广。
    （三）组织工作。组织力量保证这一方法彻底贯彻，专署第一次从各部门抽出十五个干部，分发各县参加劳英座谈会，了解问题，总结典型，帮助制订方针计划，依据回署后汇报的问题，第二次又抽出十五个干部，分发各县帮助解决问题推进工作（同蒲区以水利为主，以平遥为重点。白晋区以群众运动和生产结合为主，以屯留为重点。沁安区以生产为主，以沁源为重点），各部（除建设科外）通过作中心工作，推动部门工作，各县都贯彻这一精神。据已得的材料，以沁源执行这一精神为彻底，它除留十余干部坚持机关工作和农业生产外，抽出十九个干部深入基点帮助检查，规定半月回县汇报一次，总结问题，研究工作，交流经验。他们这一种领导方法也具体的贯彻在村，如北园村由政权、联委会、武委会各负责干部共同组织生产委员会，连同其它干部统统组织起来，大家参加互助组，分门分户领导，作到每个干部岗位明确任务具体，每个干部誓要做到三满意：即工作好上级满意，作风好群众满意，生产好家庭满意，因之工作速度很快，干部又觉得轻松愉快，根据以上的情况，目前仍在继续的组织男女全半劳力贯彻生产运动。
