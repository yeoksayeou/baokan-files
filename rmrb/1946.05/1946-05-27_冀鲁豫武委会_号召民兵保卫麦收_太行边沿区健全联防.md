    Calls on Militia to Defend Wheat Harvest
    Taihang Border Area Improves Joint Defense
    [Our Dispatch] The masses in the Taihang and Jilu Yu areas are currently launching a wheat harvest protection movement. On the Jilu Yu plains, the people of the entire area are urgently mobilized under the slogan of "Defend the Wheat Harvest". The Military Commission of the area has issued a special call to the 120,000 militia members of the entire area: 1. Mobilize urgently and oppose any complacency. Militia in all areas should actively combine with the crop watching teams to launch a mass wheat harvest protection movement. 2. Militia joint defense in the border areas should cooperate with our army to closely monitor the wheat grabbing activities of the stubborn and puppet troops, resolutely strike at those who grab wheat, and help the masses with the harvest. 3. Militia in the hinterland should combine wheat harvesting with anti-espionage work to prevent sabotage by hidden enemy agents. In Tangyin County, a border area of Taihang, the masses in various villages have restored armed joint defense, ready to defend themselves at any time, protect the wheat harvest, and resolutely prevent the reactionaries from stealing the wheat. The militia in each village has undergone review and rectification and has universally organized combat groups led by cadres in person. The sentries in the county strictly check pedestrians and report the activities of secret agents and saboteurs to ensure a smooth wheat harvest. In the Shouyang border area, villages have also organized wheat harvest protection committees to step up leadership in the mass harvest work. The masses in the hinterland, with unparalleled loving mutual aid spirit, have organized large numbers of people, livestock, and small labor teams to provide support.
