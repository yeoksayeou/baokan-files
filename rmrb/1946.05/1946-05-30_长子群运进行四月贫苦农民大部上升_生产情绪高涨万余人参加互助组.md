　　[Our Yangcheng Dispatch] The Taiyue Region's Changzi County, at its county and district cadre activist meeting last month, summarized the achievements of the county's four-month mass movement and pointed out the future direction of widespread and in-depth progress. At the beginning of March, the county successively transitioned to the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement and the increase capital movement. Except for twenty-nine natural villages in the county that had not yet carried out rent reduction, all of the remaining four hundred and fifty natural villages carried out rent reduction. The masses conducted 4,598 rent reduction reasoning sessions, with the participation of 54,251 people. The masses recovered 12,760 mu and nine fen of land, 88,851 shi, six dou, and nine sheng of grain, 2,882 rooms, 21,705 silver yuan, 59,390 Ji banknotes, and 196 head of livestock. During the movement, the number of peasant association members increased to 25,317, and the number of militia increased to 4,684. In the struggle, 1,881 activists emerged. Due to the rapid development of the mass movement, rural class relations changed dramatically. According to a survey of eight villages: the number of well-to-do middle peasants increased from 34 households to 55 households, the number of middle peasants increased from 464 households to 915 households, the number of poor peasants decreased from 638 households to 389 households, and the number of extremely poor decreased from 189 households to 7 households. The masses' enthusiasm for production after recovering their own interests has been unprecedentedly high. Currently, 1,572 mutual aid groups have been established throughout the county, with the participation of 11,149 people, who are actively engaged in agricultural production. The county leadership has now pointed out to the entire county: The direction of future efforts is to make the movement more in-depth and balanced. During the busy farming season, cadres should participate in labor, produce alongside the peasants, and struggle together, closely integrating production with rent reduction. And boldly use activists, trust the masses, to quickly implement rent reduction and promote the county's large-scale production movement.
