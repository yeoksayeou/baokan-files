　　Jin-Sui Troops Intensify Production
    Field Army Corps Reclaim Wasteland in the Sui-Mongol Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 8th] Troops in various parts of the Jin-Sui region are intensifying production, and field army corps are reclaiming wasteland on a large scale in the Sui-Mongol area. Garrison troops in Zhuozishan have already reclaimed 4,000 mu of wasteland. Garrison troops in the Jinzhong plains, due to the scarcity of wasteland in the local area, are not only assisting the masses in repairing canals and dredging ditches, but also organizing production teams to reclaim wasteland in the mountainous areas of Wenshui, Fenyang, and Xiaoyi. A certain regiment of the garrison in Pingyao, with the consent of the government and the masses, acquired 880 mu of river滩 land and communal land. Each company plants an average of ten mu of various corn types and has leased a portion of irrigated land to plant 120 mu of vegetables. The regimental headquarters stipulates that each unit plant five mu of vegetable land, and each soldier in the company plant two mu of land, completing the task of self-sufficiency in 39 jin of rice and grain, four months of vegetables, and oil and salt expenses. The 106th Regiment has each soldier planting two mu of land, completing the task of self-sufficiency in 39 jin of rice and grain, four months of vegetables, and oil and salt expenses. The 121st Regiment has organized two farming groups, one producing in other locations and one producing in the garrison. In general, companies of the Sixth Brigade complete 1.1 shi of public grain per person, and 2.2 shi for personal production. In the production process, officers and soldiers work together. Ying Chang, the Battalion Commander of the "Adhere" department, took the lead, actively collecting manure and reclaiming wasteland, which promoted the development of production competitions in various companies. The sowing is now largely completed. Various units are also engaged in sideline production. The "Adhere" department organized a salt boiling cooperative, and the entire regiment can be self-sufficient in alkali salt. In addition to their own production, the garrisons in various places are actively helping the masses in production. The companies of the 102nd Regiment take turns sending people to help the dependents of revolutionary martyrs and impoverished people in the garrison area. The production team of the military region headquarters carries water, chops firewood, and grinds flour for the masses in Xingxian.
