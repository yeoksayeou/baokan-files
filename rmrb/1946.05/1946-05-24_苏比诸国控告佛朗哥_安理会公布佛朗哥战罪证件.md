　　Su and Allied Nations Accuse Franco
    Security Council Releases Documents of Franco's War Crimes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st] New York dispatch: The Security Council's investigative subcommittee on Franco released to the press on the 17th the evidentiary documents submitted to the subcommittee by the Soviet Union and the Spanish Republican government. The subcommittee stated that it had sent invitations to Spanish Republican Prime Minister Giral (who is currently in Mexico attending related meetings). The Soviet letters included materials on Franco's military cooperation with the Axis powers during the war and the activities of the Blue Division. The Belgian government's letter pointed out that Franco was hiding Belgian war criminal Degrelle, who, after being sentenced to death by the Belgian government, fled into Spain in German military uniform in May 1945. The British note regarding the situation in Spain was not published due to being marked "confidential." Giral's memorandum provided evidence supporting Poland's accusation that continuing to maintain diplomatic relations with Franco outwardly constitutes recognition of the Axis powers' interference in Spain's internal affairs as legitimate, while severing relations with him would not constitute interference in Spain's internal affairs, nor would it be an infringement on Spanish sovereignty. Giral's documents revealed that Franco's armed forces had increased from 100,000 in 1936 to the current 840,000, with 250,000 stationed along the French border. It also stated that Franco possessed the technical capability and raw materials to manufacture atomic bombs. The new president of the Security Council, French representative Chauvel, declared that France believes Franco is indeed a factor threatening peace, and France is very concerned about the deployment of Franco's troops along the border. Furthermore, a dispatch reported that the United States' material on Franco, totaling 62 pages, was also submitted to the subcommittee on the 18th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] New York dispatch: The term of Egyptian representative Afifi as President of the Security Council has expired (Note: The presidency of the Security Council rotates monthly according to the alphabetical order of the names of the countries), and the new president, French representative Chauvel, succeeded him on the 17th. On the 16th, the day of the expiration of Afifi's term, he issued an appeal, urging all countries to eliminate differences and strive for lasting peace. Afifi expressed regret that the Security Council had not fully fulfilled the new tasks entrusted by the United Nations during his term, but he firmly believed that disputes among countries could be resolved through compromise. At the Security Council meeting on the 17th, the suggestion proposed by the United States was unanimously adopted, that is, to take action on Albania's application to join the United Nations two months later.

　　苏比诸国控告佛朗哥
    安理会公布佛朗哥战罪证件
    【新华社延安二十一日电】纽约讯：安理会调查佛朗哥小组委员会，十七日向报界发表了苏比及西班牙共和政府向小组提出之证明文件，小组并称已发出请柬，约请西班牙共和政府总理吉拉尔（吉氏刻在墨西哥出席有关会议）。苏方之信件，包括佛朗哥在战时与轴心军事合作及蓝色师团活动的材料。比利时政府的信件指出，佛朗哥隐藏比国战犯德格列尔，其人由比政府判处死刑后，于一九四五年五月穿德国军服逃入西班牙。英国关于西班牙形势的照会，则由于标明“机密”未予发表。吉拉尔的备忘录提供证据，支持波兰的控诉称：与佛朗哥继续维持外交关系，外表上就是承认轴心国家对西内政之干涉是合法的，而与其断绝关系，并不会构成对西班牙内政之干涉，也并不就是侵犯西国主权。吉拉尔文件揭露说：佛朗哥的武装部队已由一九三六年十万人，增至目前八十四万人，其中二十五万人驻扎法国边境一带。并称：佛朗哥在技术上与原料上，均可制造原子弹。安理会新任主席法国代表希洛蒂宣称：法国认为佛朗哥确系威胁和平之因素，法国对佛朗哥军队驻留边境，甚感不安。又讯：美国关于佛朗哥材料，亦于十八日向小组提出，长达六十二页。
    【新华社延安二十日电】纽约讯：安理会主席埃及代表阿弗菲任期已满（按：安理会主席乃按月轮流，以各国国名第一字母排次），新主席法国代表希洛蒂，已于十七日继任，阿弗菲于十六日任满之日，发出呼吁，要求各国消除异见，并为永久和平而努力，阿氏对其任内安理会未能充分履行联合国国家所委托之新任务，颇感懊丧，惟渠深信各国间之争执、未有不能妥协解决者。安理会十七日开会时，一致通过美国所提之建议，即于两月后，再就阿尔巴尼亚申请加入联合国之事采取行动。
