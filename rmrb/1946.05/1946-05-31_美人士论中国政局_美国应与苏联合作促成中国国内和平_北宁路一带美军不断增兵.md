　　American Figures Discuss the Chinese Political Situation
    The United States Should Cooperate with the Soviet Union to Promote Domestic Peace in China
    American Troops Continuously Increase Forces Along the Beining Railway
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] According to the U.S. Information Service, Massachusetts, 25th: U.S. Representative Hugh De Lacy (a Democrat from Washington state who strongly opposed Hurley's corrupt policy towards China), Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, and Representative Walter Judd, a Republican, discussed the various problems facing China in the process of completing the "unified and democratic China" stipulated by the Moscow Conference during a broadcast on the National Radio Network on the evening of the 25th. When discussing the responsibility for the recent Chinese internal strife, De Lacy pointed out: "Most of the fault lies with the central government" because the Kuomintang side violated the agreements more often. De Lacy advocated that "the United States should use its military strength and all its power and prestige to promote domestic peace in China, and should not favor any side during the civil war." When De Lacy mentioned the Manchurian issue, he emphasized: "We should not forget that the people of Manchuria have been under the iron heel of the Japanese since 1931. They long for freedom, and they do not want to be conquered by foreigners again, even if their new conquerors are Chinese." De Lacy also called for U.S.-Soviet cooperation to solve the China problem. In his broadcast, Butterworth, in addition to discussing Truman's policy statement on China last year, claimed that the aid we give to China is directed at the central government, but on the other hand, he also declared: But in any case, it should not fuel the Chinese civil war. Butterworth also mentioned the Political Consultative Conference, saying: The Consultative Conference decided to organize a coalition government, formulate a democratic constitution, guarantee personal, freedom of speech, assembly, and publication, and recognize that all political parties have equal legal status. In addition, agreements were reached on elections and the promotion of local autonomy. The Political Consultative Conference was a comprehensive meeting in China and a major step towards democracy in China. He expressed regret over the resurgence of internal strife after the Consultative Conference and the failure to implement the agreements. Butterworth then revealed the views of American public opinion, saying: "American public opinion is eager for China to produce a democratic coalition government, and unanimously agrees that we should cooperate with the Soviet Union to formulate a policy towards China and the entire Far East." In his broadcast, Judd made some words to protect the Kuomintang, but also claimed that "we should be in a neutral position, not favoring any political party, and supporting General Marshall's arduous work, so that the United States, China, and international peace can benefit greatly." He also stated: "Supporting the current government to complete unification by force contains the possibility of being unwelcome, that is, China will be divided into two opposing camps, and all constructive policies in the Far East will be seriously hampered."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] TASS Shanghai, 26th: The military reporter of the Millard’s Review reported: "In May, various units of the U.S. Marine Corps were transferred to the Beining Railway area to protect this transportation route controlled by the Kuomintang. The U.S. garrison troops stationed between Tangshan and Kaiping have been increased by 500 people. On May 14, the U.S. garrison troops stationed in Tangshan City increased from the original 400 to 600." Not long ago, Major General Rockey, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Tangshan, claimed: "The basic mission of the U.S. military is to defend Tangshan Airport." The reporter said: "Under the protection of the U.S. military, the Kuomintang army is continuing to advance in order to conduct a large-scale war in Manchuria." The reporter continued: Because the Kuomintang army has launched offensives in Manchuria and other parts of China, peace negotiations are at a critical juncture, and any form of American assistance to the Kuomintang at this time will only promote the Chinese civil war. While the United States has publicly acknowledged that it wants to prevent this civil war, it cannot deny the reality that American assistance to the Kuomintang army has strengthened the internal hostility in China. In order to fight against the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, the elite Kuomintang army trained and equipped by the United States is being transferred from various parts of China to Manchuria via Qinhuangdao by the United States. The U.S. Marine Corps is now stationed in Qinhuangdao. Kuomintang personnel trained by the United States are now driving American tanks and bombers, launching offensives and bombing in the main directions of the Northeast, causing tens of thousands of residents to be killed and injured by American bombs and making thousands of people homeless. The houses at a station south of Benxi Lake have been completely destroyed by Kuomintang shells.

　　美人士论中国政局
    美国应与苏联合作促成中国国内和平     
    北宁路一带美军不断增兵
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据美新闻处马萨诸赤州廿五日讯：美华盛顿州民主党众议员德拉西（曾极力反对赫尔利对华的腐败政策）、国务院远东司长范宣德及共和党众议员裘德，二十五日晚在国民无线电台广播中，论述中国在完成莫斯科会议所规定之“统一与民主中国”过程内所面临之各种问题。德拉西在谈到最近中国内争之责任时指出：“大部过失在于中央政府”，因国民党方面违反协议之处较多。德氏力主“美国应利用兵力及一切力量和声望，以促成中国国内之和平，而不应于内战期中偏袒任何一方”。德氏述及满洲问题时强调说：“吾人不应忘却，满洲人民自一九三一年以来，即处于日人铁蹄下，彼等渴望获得自由，彼等不愿再度为外人所征服，即使彼等之新征服者为华人，亦属如此”。德氏并要求美苏合作，解决中国问题。范宣德在广播中，除论述去年杜鲁门对华政策声明外，一面虽称吾人给予中国之援助以中央政府为对象，另一方面又宣称：但无论如何，不应助长中国内战，范氏并称其政治协商会议，他说：协商会议决定组织联合政府，制定民主宪法、保证人身、言论、集会、出版等自由，承认各政党均有同等之合法地位，外此并获致关于选举、促进地方自治之协议。政治协商会议为中国之全面性会议，实为中国走向民主之一大进展。对于协商会议后内争之重新抬头，与协议之未能实现，表示遗憾。范氏继透露美国舆论之意见称：“美国舆论亟望中国能产生一民主联合政府，并一致承认应与苏联合作，共订一对中国及整个远东之政策”。裘德在广播中，对国民党作了袒护之词，但也力称“吾人应以中立之地位，不袒护任何政党，而支持马歇尔将军之艰巨工作，俾使中美及国际和平均获巨利”。并称：“支持现政府以武力完成统一，含有不受人欢迎之可能，即中国将分成两个对立之阵营，而使远东一切建设性之政策受到严重之阻碍。”
    【新华社延安二十七日电】塔斯社上海二十六日电，密勒士评论报军事访员报导：“五月份美海军陆战队各部队被调至北宁路一带，保护操纵在国民党手里的这条交通路，唐山开平间驻扎的美军卫戍军，已增加五百人。五月十四日，唐山市内驻扎的美军卫戍军已从原有的四百人，增加到六百人”。不久前在唐山的美海军陆战队司令骆基少将声称：“美军基本任务是保卫唐山飞机场”。该访员称：“国民党军队在美军保护下，正在继续推进，以便在满洲进行大规模的战争”。该访员继称：由于国民党军队在满洲及中国其它各地展开进攻，和平谈判已处于紧急关头，而现时美国无论用那一种形式帮助国民党，只会促进中国的内战。而美国曾公开承认要夹阻挡这种内战，不能否认现实，即美国帮助国民党军，加强了中国内部的敌视行动。为了与东北民主联军作战，美国训练与装备的精锐国民党军队，正经美国从中国各地经秦皇岛调赴满洲。在秦皇岛现已驻有美海军陆战队，由美国训练的国民党人员，现正驾驶着美国坦克与轰炸机，在东北各主要方向进行进攻与轰炸，使成千上万的居民，都死伤于美国炸弹之下，并使成千人无家可归。本溪湖以南一车站的房屋，已全部被国民党炮弹炸毁。
