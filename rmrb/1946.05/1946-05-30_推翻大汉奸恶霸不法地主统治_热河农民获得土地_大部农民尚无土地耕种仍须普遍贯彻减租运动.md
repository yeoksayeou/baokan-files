　　Overthrow the Rule of Traitorous, Despotic, and Illegal Landlords
　　Rehe Peasants Obtain Land
　　Most Peasants Still Have No Land to Cultivate, and the Rent Reduction Movement Must Be Universally Implemented
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 25th] Rehe peasants are being universally drawn into the rent reduction movement through the liquidation movement. In many places, some peasants have already turned themselves around, obtaining land and grain. According to incomplete statistics from six counties, including Chengde, Longhua, Weichang, Luanping, Pingquan, and Fengning, the people have obtained 89,000 mu of land from major traitors, local bullies, despots, illegal landlords, and usurers. This includes 20,000 mu in Chengde, 20,000 mu in Longhua, 15,000 mu in Weichang, 15,000 mu in Pingquan, 10,000 mu in Luanping, and 5,000 mu in Fengning, as well as more than 70,000 shi of grain, and a large amount of cash, livestock, and houses. Other counties, such as Chifeng, Lingyuan, and Jianchang, are also actively carrying out the rent reduction movement. In this province, only a small portion of peasants have "land to the tillers," while more than 90% of hardworking peasants still have no land to cultivate. Therefore, the rent reduction movement must be vigorously and universally carried out to truly liberate all the peasants of Rehe.
　　In the previous period of the peasants' automatic liquidation, the province adopted the following methods: First, confiscating the land of major traitors and distributing it to peasants with no land or little land. Second, liquidating the local bullies, despots, illegal landlords, secret agents, and traitors who committed wrongdoing during the puppet Manchukuo regime, returning the land they had seized to the peasants, and compensating the peasants for other losses with land. Third, "assigning land to tillers," which refers to the so-called "imperial granary estate land" that the Qing Dynasty had seized from the people and given to meritorious lackeys. Now, these lands are returned to the original tenants without compensation. Fourth, "returning concealed land to tillers," which refers to the "imperial granary estate land" that was omitted from registration, and the underreported and undertaxed land of illegal landlords, which is also distributed to the peasants without compensation. Fifth, liquidating all extra-economic exploitation arising from land and tenancy relations, such as high rents and "bangqing" labor services. Sixth, the land seized from peasants by usurers through cruel exploitation methods is now redeemed by the peasants through interest reduction. Among these methods, "assigning land to tillers" has resolved the largest amount of land. The vast majority of those who have obtained land this time are poor peasants, hired laborers, and some middle peasants, who have united unprecedentedly due to their vested interests and gradually increasing political awareness.

　　推翻大汉奸恶霸不法地主统治
    热河农民获得土地   
    大部农民尚无土地耕种仍须普遍贯彻减租运动
    〔新华社承德廿五日电〕热河农民正由清算运动，普遍卷入减租运动，许多地方的部分农民已开始翻了身，获得了土地与粮食。根据承德、隆化、围场、滦平、平泉、丰宁等六县不完全统计：人民从大汉奸、豪绅、恶霸、不法大地主、高利贷者手中，获得了八万九千亩土地。计承德二万亩、隆化二万亩、围场一万五千亩、平泉一万五千亩、滦平一万亩、丰宁五千亩土地与七万多石粮食，以及大量的现款牲畜和房屋等。其他如赤峰、凌源、建昌等县，也正积极开展减租运动。该省现在已经“耕者有其田”的只有一小部分农民，而百分之九十以上的勤苦农民，还没有土地耕种。因之减租运动还要全力的普遍开展，使热河全体农民真正翻身。
    该省在前一时期之农民自动清算中，曾采取以下几种办法：第一是没收大汉奸的土地分给无地或少地的农民。第二是清算伪满时为非作恶的豪绅、恶霸、不法地主与特务、汉奸，将他们霸占去的土地归还农民，并以土地赔偿农民其他损失。第三是“挂地归农”，这是满清皇朝抢夺民田赐给功狗的所谓“皇粮庄头地”，现在把这些土地无代价的归还原佃户。第四是“黑地归农”，这是漏挂的“皇粮庄头地”，和不法地主以多报少的漏税地，亦无代价的分给农民。第五是清算由土地与租佃关系而产生的一切超经济剥削，如高额地租与“傍青”的劳役等。第六是高利贷者用残酷剥削方法从农民手中夺去的土地。现在经过减息办法，由农民抽赎回来，其中以挂地归农，解决土地的数量为最多。此次获得土地者，极大多数是贫农、雇农与一部分中农，他们由于切身利益与逐渐增高的政治觉悟，已空前地团结起来。
