　　Soviet Post-War Industrial Construction Takes a Great Leap Forward
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th] Soviet heavy industry is the source of all Soviet defense forces, and therefore it has become one of the centers of the new Five-Year Plan. The general task of the new Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total industrial production should exceed the pre-war level by 48 percent, while the level of heavy industrial production is stipulated to exceed it by 100 percent, with steel increasing by 37 percent, iron by 35 percent, coal by 50 percent, kerosene by 14 percent, and electricity by 40 percent. The total investment in the new Five-Year Plan is 484 billion rubles, of which 234 billion rubles are invested in restoration work, and the rest is invested in expanding industry. According to Stalin's report at the voters' meeting on February 9th, the total amount of Soviet industrial production in 1940 was 137 billion rubles, with steel at 18.3 million tons, iron at 15 million tons, coal at 166 million tons, and kerosene at 31 million tons. Based on these figures, it can be inferred that the total amount of Soviet industrial production in the Fourth Five-Year Plan should reach 203.5 billion rubles, steel should reach 25.071 million tons, iron should reach 20.25 million tons, coal should reach 349 million tons, and kerosene should reach 35.34 million tons. Stalin pointed out that in the next fifteen years, the goal is to reach an annual production of 60 million tons of steel, 50 million tons of pig iron, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of kerosene. Although this number is very large, based on the current recovery situation in the Soviet Union, it can be seen that the Soviet Union is fully confident in completing this huge task.
    In terms of the steel industry, the Soviet steel industry had four powerful centers before the war: the Eastern Center in the Kazakh region, the Southern Center in Ukraine and Crimea, the Caucasus Center, and the Far Eastern Novosibirsk Center. Except for the second center, which was partially damaged by the German invaders, the others have maintained constant development in production. Taking only the Magnitogorsk area in the Eastern Center as an example, the current total steel production has exceeded the pre-war level by more than 35 percent (annual production of 2.47 million tons of steel and 2 million tons of iron). Chelyabinsk's production has exceeded the steel production of any region in the Soviet Union by more than seven times. In the Southern Center, most of the smelting equipment has been repaired. In Krivoy Rog and Kerch in the region, some have already exceeded the pre-war level by last year. In Zaporozhye and Makeyevka, which suffered the most damage, it will also be possible to exceed the pre-war level before the end of this year. Other iron and steel industries in Stalingrad, which suffered heavy losses, will also reach pre-war levels in 1947. Powerful new steel factories near Leningrad in northwestern Soviet Union have all begun construction, and by 1950, the metal output will be 600,000 tons per year.
    In terms of the coal industry, Soviet coal production is distributed in the Donets Basin, the Tula region in central Russia, the Urals, and the Sverdlovsk region. Among them, in the largest Donets Basin, as of the end of last year, 122 of the 135 large mines that were destroyed have been repaired, 136 mines have reached pre-war levels, and 41 have even exceeded them. The production volume in the Ural coal producing area has doubled the pre-war level in the past year alone.
    In terms of the kerosene industry, the Soviet kerosene production centers are in Grozny in Dagestan, Azerbaijan, Krasnodar, and Sakhalin Island. Except for Krasnodar, which was partially damaged, the others are intact and have new equipment, such as the 880-kilometer-long oil pipeline from Grozny to the Donets coal producing area, and the 100-kilometer-long oil pipeline from Rostov to the Donets. The Soviet Union has the world's largest oil reserves, and three new regions were discovered during the war. For example, Baku's production of super aviation fuel reached the annual output before the war in March.
    In terms of the power and machinery manufacturing industries, these two departments are currently the fastest growing departments in terms of productivity. Power production in the new Five-Year Plan will exceed the total power of the twelve years before the war, with an annual output of 82 billion kilowatt-hours. By the end of March, more than 70 percent had been restored to pre-war levels. One of the Soviet Union's largest power plants, Zebaastopol, and the Karelian power plant, which were thoroughly destroyed by the German invaders, were repaired by the end of last year, and their productivity has exceeded pre-war levels. The world-renowned Dnieper Power Plant has also been partially repaired and put into operation, and a power plant that is twenty times larger than the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant is currently under construction, and it is planned to restore the total power generation before the war by the end of this year. A significant feature of the new Five-Year Plan is the large-scale use of machinery. The production of heavy machinery manufacturing is expanding at an unprecedented rate. The production of steel plant equipment will increase from 2,800 tons in 1940 to 102,900 tons in 1950. The new Five-Year Plan will establish thirteen heavy machinery manufacturing plants. The machinery plant built in southern Ural will be one of the largest factories in the country. The work of converting munitions factories into machinery factories was completed in just a few months after the war. The largest artillery factory during the war is now manufacturing machines for all oilfield equipment, the tank factory has been converted into a factory manufacturing railway vehicle machinery, the mortar factory has been converted into a factory manufacturing textile machines, and the aircraft factory has been converted into a factory manufacturing light transportation equipment. The production scale of these factories is several times higher than the current level of all industrial production. For example, the production volume of the Moscow Vas Machinery Manufacturing Plant has more than doubled the pre-war level. The Red Proletariat Machinery Manufacturing Plant reached the same level as before the war by September last year. The Ural's ×Pisker Machinery Plant's output last year was three times that of the previous year. Soviet heavy industrial production exceeded the plan in the first quarter of this year, with iron exceeding by 1.7 percent, steel by 6.5 percent, rolled iron by 5.1 percent, and coking coal by 1.3 percent. Overall, Soviet heavy industry can not only complete but also exceed the plan. The amazing development of Soviet heavy industry will determine the path to world peace and happiness.

　　苏联战后工业建设突飞猛进
    【新华社延安十四日电】苏联重工业是苏联一切国防力量的源泉，因此它便成为新五年计划的中心之一。新五年计划的总任务中，规定整个工业生产量，要超过战前的百分之四十八，而重工业生产的水平，则规定要超过一倍，其中钢增加百分之三十七，铁百分之三十五，煤炭百分之五十，煤油百分之十四，电力百分之四十。新五年计划之总投资为四千八百四十万万卢布，投于恢复工作者为二千三百四十万万卢布，其余则投于扩充工业。据斯大林二月九日在选民大会上的报告，一九四零年苏联工业生产的总量，共计一千三百七十万万卢布，钢为一千八百三十万吨，铁一千五百万吨，煤炭一万万六千六百万吨，煤油三千一百吨。根据此数字，可以推测第四个五年计划苏联工业生产的总量，应达到二千零三十五万万卢布，钢达到二千五百零七万一千吨，铁二千零二十五万吨，煤炭三万万四千九百万吨，煤油三千五百三十四万吨。斯大林指出在今后的十五年中，要达到年产钢六千万吨，铣铁五千万吨，煤炭五万万吨，煤油六千万吨。这个数字虽然非常巨大，但根据苏联目前恢复情形，可以看出苏联完全有把握去完成这巨大的任务。
    在钢铁工业方面，苏联的钢铁工业在战前有四个强大的中心，哈萨克区域的东方中心，乌克兰与克里米亚的南方中心，高加索中心，及远东的新西伯利亚中心，除了第二个中心受到德寇部分破坏外，其他均保持生产恒常的发展，仅以东方中心的马格尼托高尔斯克一区来说，目前钢铁生产总量已超过战前的百分之三十五以上（年产钢二百四十七万吨，铁二百万吨），车里雅宾斯克拉生产已超过苏联任何一区钢生产的七倍以上。在南方中心，熔炉设备大部已告修复，该区的克里沃罗与刻赤，至去年若干已超过战前水平，在损失最重的萨波罗什与马凯也夫卡，也能在今年年底以前，超过战前水平。他如损失惨重的斯大林格勒钢铁业，在一九四七年亦将达到战前水平。苏联西北列宁格勒附近各强大新钢铁工厂，均已动工，到一九五零年，金属产量将年产六十万吨。
    在煤炭工业方面，苏联煤炭生产分布在顿尼兹盆地，俄罗斯中部图拉地区，乌拉尔，斯维德洛夫斯克区，其中最大的顿尼兹盆地，截止去年年底，被破坏的一百三十五座大矿井中，已有一百二十二座已经修复，一三六座矿井已达战前水平，四十一座并已超过。乌拉尔产煤区生产量，仅在去年一年，即超过战前二倍。
    在煤油工业方面，苏联的煤油生产中心，在达吉斯坦之格罗尼斯、阿塞尔拜疆、克拉斯诺达尔、库页岛，除克拉斯诺达尔遭部分破坏外，其他完好如常，并有新的装备，如格罗尼斯至顿尼兹煤产区的八百八十公里长的输油管，罗斯托夫至顿尼兹的一百公里长的石油管。苏联石油储藏量，是世界第一位，在战时又发现了三个地区。如巴库的生产超能飞机燃料，三月份的产量就达到战前一年的产量。
    在电力与机器制造业方面，这两部门是目前生产力发展最迅速的部门，电力生产在新五年计划中将超过战前十二年之总电力，年产八百二十万万基罗瓦特，至三月底已有百分之七十以上恢复到战前水平。受德寇彻底破坏的苏联最大发电厂之一的寨巴斯托波尔，和卡累利亚发电厂，在去年年底就已修复，而且生产力已超过战前。世界驰名的德涅泊电厂，亦已部分修复开工，目前正在建造一超过德涅泊水电厂二十倍的发电厂，并计划在今年年底要恢复战前发电总量。新五年计划的显著特点，是大规模使用机器，重机器制造业正以空前速度扩充，钢铁工厂装备的生产，到一九五零年，较之一九四零年要从二千八百吨增至十万二千九百吨。新五年计划将建立十三个重机器制造厂，乌拉尔南部建立的机器厂，将为全国最大工厂之一。军火工厂转化为机器工厂的工作，在战后不到几个月，即已完成，战时最大的大炮工厂，现在正在制造一切油田装备的机器，坦克工厂已改为制造铁路车辆机械的工厂，迫击炮工厂已改为制造纺织机工厂，飞机工厂已改为轻便交通用具工厂。这些工厂的生产规模，几超过目前一切工业生产水平，例如莫斯科瓦斯机器制造厂生产量，已超过战前一倍以上，红色普罗列塔利亚机器制造厂，到去年九月即已达同战前水平。乌拉尔的×皮斯克机器厂，去年的产量达到前年的三倍。苏联重工业生产，在今年第一季即已超过计划，铁超过百分之一·七，钢百分之六·五，卷铁百分之五·一，焦煤百分之一·三。综观以上，苏联重工业不但能完成，且能超过计划，苏联重工业的惊人发展，将决定世界和平幸福的道路。
