　　【Xinhua News Agency, Changzhi, 10th】 The Yan Army on the Bai-Jin Line has fabricated so-called "accusations against the crimes of the Communist Party," and has already staged an incident of beating personnel of the CCP Liaison Group in Qin County. On the evening of April 30th, more than 30 plainclothes special agents, carrying short guns and claiming to be "petitioners," broke into the residence of our CCP Liaison Group in Qin County. Using their fabricated facts, they coerced Comrade Wang Qing, acting leader of the Liaison Group, to sign and stamp the document, acknowledging their claims. Comrade Wang Qing sternly refused. The plainclothes special agents then hurled abuse, shouted wildly, and struck him. Comrade Wang Qing's left arm was broken, his pocket was torn, and they robbed him of 5,000 Jichaos, more than 40,000 in legal currency, one medal, one fountain pen, and nine documents, and unreasonably detained him for twelve hours. The next day, our Liaison Group personnel conducted street propaganda in the city, exposing the shameless behavior of the special agents. The news spread throughout the city. Even under the rule of special agents, people in the streets and alleys spoke out righteously, denouncing the brutality of the special agents. They said to our side: "You are truly sincere in advocating peace." Afterwards, our Liaison Group lodged a protest with the East Qin Line Executive Group, demanding severe punishment for such hooligan behavior by the KMT special agents, and guaranteeing the safety of our personnel to facilitate the mediation work.

　　沁县阎军特务横行
    殴劫我联络组人员
    我已向东沁线小组提出抗议
    【新华社长治十日电】白晋线阎军伪造所谓“控诉共党罪行”，已在沁县城内演出殴打中共联络组人员事件。四月三十日晚，突有便衣特务卅余人，身带短枪，口称“请愿”，闯入我中共驻沁县联络组住宅，以其捏造之事实，威迫该联络组代理组长王清同志签名盖章，予以承认，当遭王清同志严正拒绝，该便衣特务等即肆口谩骂，狂啸乱打，王清同志左臂打断，衣袋撕碎，抢去冀钞五千元，法币四万余元，勋章一个，水笔一枝，文件九件，并无理扣押十二小时。次日我联络组人员在城内沿街宣传，揭发特务的无耻行为，消息传遍全城，虽在特务统治下，街谈巷议，无不仗义执言痛绝特务暴行。而向我方说：“你们才真是诚心诚意讲和平的。”事后我联络组即向东沁线执行小组提出抗议，要求严惩国特此种流氓行为，保障我方人员安全，以利调处工作之进行。
