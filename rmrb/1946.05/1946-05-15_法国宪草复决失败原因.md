　　News Agency Reporter's Report on Reasons for Failure of French Draft Constitution Referendum
    [New China News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] TASS, Paris, 8th: A "News" reporter reports on the reasons for the failure of the French Draft Constitution Referendum, saying: As everyone knows, reactionaries such as the Republican Liberty Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the right-wing of the Radical Socialist Party, conducted a frantic campaign against the new constitution. A large number of French newspapers subsidized by financial capitalists reflected the opinions of the right-wing reactionaries, and these newspapers played a considerable role in propaganda. In their propaganda, the reactionaries also used France's current economic difficulties, blaming them on the current government, saying that the tripartite government was incapable of revitalizing the country. But in fact, the economic difficulties were caused by the ambiguous activities of the big financiers and the slowdown of the industrialists. We believe that the temporary victory obtained by the reactionary forces will certainly not cause disorder in the ranks of the new democrats. However, this matter once again underscores the importance of all democratic forces uniting to fight against the reactionary forces—the followers of Pétain, the Vichy elements, and all kinds of fascists.

　　法国宪草复决失败原因
    消息报记者报导
    【新华社延安十日电】塔斯社巴黎八日电：消息报记者报导法国宪草复决失败的原因说：大家知道，反动派如共和自由党、人民共和运动急进社会党的右翼等，并进行了疯狂的反对新宪宣传，受金融资本家津贴的大量法国报纸，反映了右翼反动派的言论，这些报纸在宣传上起了颇大作用。反动分子在宣传中还运用法国当前的经济困难，把它归罪于现政权，他们说三党政府没有能力使国家复兴，可其事实上，经济的困难，是由于大金融家的暧昧勾当，与工业家的怠工所造成的。我们相信，使反动势力获得暂时胜利的，决不会在新民主主义者行列中打起紊乱，可是，这件事又一次加重了一切民主势力团结一致为反对反动势力们——贝当的党徒、维希分子以及一切种类的法西斯分子——而斗争的重要性。
