　　US Sabotages Moscow Resolution
    US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea Fails
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Moscow dispatch: The News reports details of the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea being forced to cease work, accusing the US side of sabotaging the Moscow Resolution. The US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea held its first meeting in Seoul on March 20, mainly to organize a provisional Korean democratic government as quickly as possible, in accordance with the decision on Korea of the Three Foreign Ministers' Moscow Conference. On this issue, the commission should consult with various Korean democratic parties and social organizations. However, at the first meeting, the US and Soviet representatives argued over the conditions for the participation of Korean democratic parties and social organizations in the consultation, as well as the extent of the provisional government's composition. On the first issue, the Soviet representative proposed that the basic condition for the participation of democratic parties and social organizations in the consultation was that they recognize and support the Moscow Resolution. The US representative, on the other hand, insisted that the joint commission establish a separate "Consultative Alliance," based on the auxiliary organs of US Commander Hodge in South Korea (formed by representatives of reactionary parties), and supplemented by representatives of several democratic parties from North Korea. The joint commission would then consult with this reactionary alliance and entrust it with submitting a list of the provisional Korean democratic government and the provisional constitution of that government. The Soviet representative opposed this proposal, arguing that the establishment of a "Consultative Alliance" violated the Moscow Resolution and that the joint commission should maintain direct contact with various Korean democratic parties and social organizations. After lengthy discussions, in order to accelerate the formation of a provisional Korean democratic government, the Soviet side made many concessions to the US side. On April 5, the Soviet side suggested that those parties and social organizations that opposed the Moscow Resolution should be allowed to participate in the consultation, provided they admitted their mistakes and announced their support for the Moscow Resolution, but that non-democratic elements should not be allowed to participate in the provisional government. The US and Soviet representatives concluded their negotiations and issued Communiqué No. 5 on April 19, stipulating that the joint commission should consult with those truly democratic parties and social organizations that had issued declarations in support of the Moscow Conference's decision on Korea. After the communiqué was issued, the commission began drafting the charter of the major democratic parties and social organizations participating in the consultation, reaching the following agreement: the list for North Korea would be submitted by the Soviet command, and the list for South Korea would be submitted by the US side. However, of the twenty parties and social organizations submitted by the US side, only three belonged to the National Democratic Front, and the rest belonged to the so-called "Democratic Council." These people were notorious for opposing the Moscow Resolution, and at the same time, they refused to correct their mistakes as stipulated in Communiqué No. 5 and were unwilling to express their support for the Moscow Resolution. Lieutenant General Hodge came out to explain for them, distorting the four powers' five-year trusteeship of Korea in the Moscow Resolution. He also explained that the declaration required to sign Communiqué No. 5 did not equal agreeing with or supporting the trusteeship system. The "Democratic Council" obtained guarantees from Hodge's statement and allowed its parties and social organizations to sign a declaration in support of the Moscow Resolution on May 1. However, at the same time, it issued a statement: "Signing the declaration does not mean cooperating with the joint commission. After the formation of the provisional government, we will come out against the trusteeship system." This statement clearly contained a major conspiracy, so after the statement was issued, the Soviet Union naturally refused the "Democratic Council's" parties and social organizations the right to participate in the consultation.
    On the second issue, the US side suggested that government agencies and the Central Economic Organ for unifying the Korean economy should be organized by the joint commission itself, and insisted that they should be established before the provisional government was formed. The Soviet side rejected this plan, arguing that these two institutions should only be implemented after the provisional democratic government was formed.
    After the negotiations on the first issue ended, the US side attempted to delay the establishment of a provisional government in Korea, proposing to first discuss the issue of unifying the Korean economy and eliminating the North-South border. The Soviet representative also sternly rejected this. The US delegation then suggested that the joint commission cease its work, and the Soviet delegation was forced to agree.

### 美方破坏莫斯科决议  朝鲜美苏委会流产

　　美方破坏莫斯科决议
    朝鲜美苏委会流产
    【新华社延安二十日电】莫斯科讯：消息报登载朝鲜苏美共同委员会被迫停止工作的详情，指责美方破坏莫斯科决议。苏美共同委员会三月二十日在汉城开首次会议，主要是根据三外长莫斯科会议朝鲜决定，尽速组织一临时朝鲜民主政府。在此问题上，该委员会应与朝鲜各民主政党及社会组织咨商，但在首次会议上，苏美代表在朝鲜各民主政党与社会组织参加咨商的条件上，以及临时政府组成的程度上，发生了争执。在第一个问题，苏联代表提出民主政党社会组织参加咨商的基本条件，是它们承认与支持莫斯科决定；美代表则主张共同委员会另外建立一个“咨询联盟”，以朝鲜南部美司令霍奇中将的辅助机关（为反动党派代表所结成）为基础，再补充几名朝鲜北部的民主政党的代表组成之。而共同委员会即与此反动联盟咨商，并委托它提出朝鲜临时民主政府的名单，以及该政府的临时宪法。苏联代表反对此一建议，认为建立“咨询联盟”是违反莫斯科决定，是共同委员会与朝鲜各民主政党与社会组织保持直接联系。经过长时讨论后，苏方为了加速组成朝鲜临时民主政府，便对美方作了很多让步，苏方于四月五日建议那些反对莫斯科决定的各政党及社会组织，只要承认他们的错误，并宣布支持莫斯科决定，即准许他们参加咨商，但绝不允许非民主分子参加临时政府。苏美代表谈判结束，便于四月十九日发表第五号公报，规定共同委员会应与那些真正民主的，并发表宣言拥护莫斯科会议朝鲜决定的各民主政党与社会组织进行商讨。公报发表后，委员会即着手起草参加咨商的各主要民主政党与社会组织的章程，达到如下协议：朝鲜北部名单由苏指挥部提出，南部由美方提出。但美方提出的二十个政党与社会组织的名单中，属于全国民主阵线的只有三个，其余则属于所谓“民主委员部”。这些人反对莫斯科决定而臭名昭著，同时他们拒绝第五号公报中的规定改正他们的错误，并不愿表明支持莫斯科决定的态度。霍奇中将便出来为他们解释，曲解朝鲜决定中四强对朝鲜实行五年托管。并解释签署第五号公报所需要的声明，并不就等于赞成或支持托管制。“民主委员部”自霍奇声明中获得了保障，便于五月一日准许其政党与社会组织签署拥护莫斯科决定的宣言。但同时又发表声明：“签署宣言并不意味着与共同委员会合作，于组成临时政府之后，我们即出而反对托管制”。这项声明显然包括很大阴谋在内，因此该声明发表后，苏联当然就拒绝“民主委员部”各政党与社会组织参加咨商的权利。
    在第二个问题上，美方建议政府机构及统一朝鲜经济的中央经济机关，由共同委员会本身来组织，并主张临时政府组成以前，即应建立起来；苏方拒绝这一计划，认为这二个机构均应在临时民主政府组成后才能实行。
    在第一个问题上，双方终止谈判后，美方企图延迟朝鲜临时政府的建立，提出先讨论统一朝鲜经济问题与消除南北边界问题，苏代表亦予以严正拒绝。美代表团随即建议共同委员会停止其工作，苏代表团被迫同意。
