　　【Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 22nd】The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the General Headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army announced: Our army will completely and voluntarily withdraw from Changchun at 24:00 on the 22nd. We are taking this step not because we lack the strength to defend Changchun, but because we hope to see whether the Kuomintang has the sincerity to stop the civil war and achieve peace in the Northeast by making the concession of voluntarily withdrawing from Changchun, and because we are unwilling to have the 800,000 people of Changchun and the city of Changchun be destroyed by war. The Kuomintang authorities' endless expansion of the civil war in the Northeast, and their unrestricted troop transport to the Northeast with American aid, using American weapons, rocket launchers, and aircraft, not only bombing military areas, but also indiscriminately bombing and strafing peaceful cities and villages, have caused tens of millions of peaceful residents in the Northeast to suffer from the scourge of war, cities and villages to be bombed, people to be displaced, and production to be impossible. The Kuomintang authorities' actions in expanding the civil war in the Northeast not only cause disasters to the people of the Northeast, but are bound to lead to the destruction of peace throughout the country. In order to achieve the early realization of peace in the Northeast and to consolidate peace throughout the country, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the General Headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army are willing to make the major concession of voluntarily withdrawing from Changchun, but the concession is limited. If the Kuomintang authorities still do not stop the civil war in the Northeast, we will still take resolute self-defense measures, and the continued existence of the civil war in the Northeast is entirely due to the Kuomintang's unwillingness for peace in the Northeast.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th】This office has received news from the Northeast Democratic Allied Army Headquarters stating: After withdrawing from Sipingjie, our army safely withdrew from Gongzhuling and Changchun on the 22nd. The Kuomintang army entered the above two locations on the 23rd.

　　求取东北停战巩固国内和平
    我军自动让出长春
    国民党当局如果继续进行东北内战，我有足够力量将仍然坚决自卫
    【新华社长春二十二日电】中共中央东北局与东北民主联军总司令部宣布：我军于二十二日二十四时全部自动撤出长春。我们采取此一步骤，并不是我们没有防卫长春的力量，而是由于我们希望以自动撤出长春的让步，看国民党在东北是否有停止内战、实现和平的诚意，并由于我们不愿使长春八十万人民及长春城市遭受战争的毁灭。国民党当局在东北无止境的扩大内战，以及在美国的援助下无限制的运兵东北，使用美国的武器，火箭炮、飞机、不仅向军事地区轰炸，而且向和平城市与村屯滥施轰炸扫射，这种行动，已使东北数千万和平居民遭受战争的涂炭，城市村屯遭受轰炸，人民流离失所，生产无法进行。国民党当局此种在东北扩大内战的行动，不仅使东北人民遭受灾难，而且势必引起全国和平的破坏。中共中央东北局与东北民主联军总司令部为求得东北和平的早日实现，并求得全国和平的巩固，不惜作自动退出长春的重大让步，但是让步是有限度的，如果国民党当局仍然不停止在东北的内战，我们将仍然采取坚决自卫的手段，而东北内战的继续存在，则完全由于国民党不愿意东北和平所致。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】此间接获东北民主联军司令部消息称：我军于撤出四平街后，已于二十二日安全撤出公主岭与长春，国民党军于二十三日进入上述两地。
