　　Kuomintang Fascists
    Favor Traitors and War Criminals
    Traitor Du Xijun Released, Traitor Pang Bingxun Promoted
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th] The Kuomintang fascists are extremely lenient towards war criminals in various places. In addition to the major North China traitors Tang Xiang, Du Xijun and others who have been openly released and are at large, even the traitors imprisoned in Shanghai are receiving preferential treatment. Central News Agency reporter Li Ming, after visiting the war criminal detention center in Shanghai on the 11th, said: He witnessed more than 400 traitors in the "Loyalty" prison, most of whom had rosy complexions. In some prison cells, there were also several boxes of Guanggan oranges, rarely seen in Shanghai. Among the 300 traitors detained in Guangzhou, such as the former Director of the Puppet Guangdong Police Department, Guo Weimin, their cells were fully equipped with ledgers, chairs, and tables, and they had books and newspapers to read, which was vastly different from ordinary prisoners. According to the person in charge of the detention center: "This is under orders to treat them favorably." In addition, the former puppet county magistrate of Yichang and others were recently acquitted. The Japanese prisoners in that county still wear hats and uniforms with the Japanese flag. They do not seem to have lost their former prestige. According to the Chinese soldier guarding them, "He still eats a catty of meat, a catty of wine, and a pack of cigarettes every day." (According to Xinmin Bao)
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th] Beiping News: According to the Yishibao, the notorious major traitor Pang Bingxun has recently been openly appointed by the Kuomintang authorities as a General Senior Staff Officer of the 11th War Zone Command. Du Xijun, who once served as the Director of the Puppet Pacification General Office and Commander-in-Chief of the Puppet North China Pacification Army, was once arrested, but has now been released.

    优容汉奸战犯
    杜逆锡钧被释放庞逆炳勋升了官
    【新华社延安十六日电】国民党法西斯派对于各地战犯在极度优容，除华北巨奸汤芗、杜锡钧等逆已被公开释放逍遥法外外，即被囚于上海之汉奸，也备受优待。中央社记者李明，十一日在沪参观战犯拘留所后称：渠目击“忠”字监内汉奸四百余人，大部面色红润，若干监房内，并置有上海鲜见之广柑数箱。又被拘广州三百名汉奸中，如伪粤警务院院长郭逆卫民等，其囚室无不帐簿俱全，椅桌齐备，且有书报可读，与一般囚犯有天壤之别。据看守所负责人说：“乃奉命优待者”。此外，宜昌的前伪县长等，最近也被宣判无罪，该县日俘依然戴膏药旗的帽子和军装，看样子不灭当年威风。据看守的中国兵说：“他每天还吃一斤肉，一斤酒，一包烟呢”。（新民报载）
    【新华社延安十四日电】北平讯：据益世报泄露，臭名远扬的大汉奸庞逆炳勋，近公然被国民党当局委任为十一战区长官部上将高级参谋。又曾任伪绥靖总署办兼伪华北绥靖军总司令之杜逆锡钧，一度被捕后，现竟予释放。
