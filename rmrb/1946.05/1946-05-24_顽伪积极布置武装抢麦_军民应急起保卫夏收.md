　　Stubborn Puppet Troops Actively Deploy Armed Forces to Seize Wheat
    Military and Civilians Urgently Rise to Defend the Summer Harvest
    [This Newspaper, Handan News] With the wheat harvest approaching, stubborn puppet troops have begun to mobilize forces to deploy for plundering the liberated areas' wheat harvest. On the 15th, Yan's stubborn forces advanced from Taiyuan and Yuci in three routes toward the wheat-producing areas of central Shanxi. One route of more than 400 people surrounded Nanzhuang, the location of my Yuci County government, and captured nine of our cadres, declaring everywhere: "As long as we have wheat, we will be able to eliminate the Communist bandits." They then occupied Beixi Village. Another route of 800 people occupied Beige Village. The third route surrounded Zhangzhuang and then occupied Yongkang Village. The 13th Regiment, transferred from the Baijin Line to the Zhengtai Line under the order of Yan Xishan, has advanced to Pindg and is now prepared to seize wheat. The troops concentrated around Yuci are called the "mobile force" snatched from the central Shanxi area by Yan Xishan. On the Tongpu Line, Yan's army stationed in Libao, east of Hongdong, under the slogan of "protecting the wheat harvest," has been arresting and killing young people in Dongs, Zhoubi, and Fengbao around the liberated area for days. A popular folk song in the border area goes: "We've waited hard for more than eight years, demons have emerged in the midst of peace, they don't talk about unity and democracy, they put knives to the people's heads, things are grabbed and people are arrested, this year the wheat is good and they'll come to cut it, making our lives really hard." In the Pinghan area, the Kuomintang army in northern Henan has also transferred Li Ying and other puppet troops, old hands at seizing wheat for the past eight years, from Anyang to Fengsu and other places in Andong. After Wang Ziquan went to Xinxiang for instructions, they are now also concentrated in Xindianji, northwest of Anyang. According to this situation, the battle task of defending the summer harvest this year has been placed very seriously and urgently before the people of the liberated areas. The military and civilians of various places should make full preparations as early as possible.

　　顽伪积极布置武装抢麦
    军民应急起保卫夏收
    【本报邯郸讯】麦收将近，顽伪军开始调动兵力布置抢掠解放区麦收。十五日阎顽由太原榆次分三路向我晋中产麦区突进。一路四百余人曾包围我榆次县府驻地之南庄，捉去我干部九人，到处声称：“只要有了麦子，消灭共匪就有把握”，旋又进占我北席村，另一路八百余占我北格村。第三路包围张庄后又占我永康村。自白晋线奉阎锡山命令调往正太线之十三团已进至平定，现在准备抢麦就绪。集中于榆次一带之部队阎锡山称之为向晋中区抢来的“机动部队”。同蒲线上，进驻洪洞以东李堡之阎军在“保卫麦收”口号下，连日向解放区四周之董寺、周壁、冯堡捕杀青年，边沿区流行的一个民谣是：“辛苦盼了八年多，和平中间出妖魔，不讲团结和民主，刀向人民头上搁，东西抓去人被捉，今年麦好他来割，害得我们真难活。”平汉方面：豫北国民党军亦把八年来抢麦老手李英等伪军由安阳调至安东之冯宿等地，王自全赴新乡请示后，现亦集中于安阳西北之辛店集。按此情况，今年保卫夏收的战斗任务，已经十分严重的紧迫的摆在解放区人民面前。各地军民应该及早作充分准备。
