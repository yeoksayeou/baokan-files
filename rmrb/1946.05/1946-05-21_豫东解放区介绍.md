　　Introduction to the Yudong Liberated Area
    On April 10th, at the meeting of chiefs of staff between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Xinxiang, Zhao Zili, Chief of Staff of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters and representative of the Kuomintang, blatantly lied, falsely claiming that "there were no CCP troops in Yudong before January 13th," attempting to deny the existence of our Yudong Liberated Area as a pretext for launching a large-scale civil war. On May 8th, the Kuomintang again submitted a memorandum to the Xinxiang group, denying the existence of our Yudong Eighth Route Army before January 14th. This is part of the Kuomintang's warmongering elements' preparations to launch a civil war.
    The Yudong Liberated Area originally included both the east (east of the new Yellow River) and west parts. As early as May 1938, during the Battle of Zhengzhou, the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of Yudong, and the Kuomintang army collapsed without a fight, fleeing at the first sign of trouble. Qixian, Suixian, Taikang, and other cities fell into enemy hands one after another. Chinese Communist Party members Wu Zhipu, Wang Jiepu, Wang Laiwen, and others, in conjunction with local anti-Japanese patriots, established the Third Detachment of the New Fourth Army for Anti-Japanese Resistance, fighting in the Suixian, Qixian, Tongxu, and Taikang areas, leading the people of Yudong to actively strike at the enemy and puppets, and creating the anti-Japanese guerrilla base area east of the river. In May of the same year, General Peng Xuefeng of the New Fourth Army led his troops eastward from Zhugou and joined forces with the Third Detachment in the Xihua area, merging into the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment of the New Fourth Army. At the end of the year, most of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment continued eastward, penetrating deep behind enemy lines, and arrived at the junction of the three provinces of Anhui, Henan, and Jiangsu in the Haozhou, Yongcheng, and Xiaoxian areas, establishing the Yu-Wan-Su Border Region, which is now the Huaibei Military Region in Central China. Comrades Feng Sheng, Ma Qinghua, and others were left to lead the guerrilla detachment and continue to persist in the struggle in the area east of the river. At this time, traitorous armed forces were springing up everywhere in the Yudong area, bandits were rampant, and the enemy was constantly conducting frenzied mopping-up operations against our army. The environment was extremely difficult, but our army continued to resist the enemy and puppets unyieldingly, and took the initiative to attack the enemy. In the spring of 1939, during an ambush against the enemy on the Qixian highway, Comrade Ma Qinghua, the political commissar of our detachment, gloriously sacrificed his life. After a year of hard struggle, the enemy's attempt to eliminate our army completely failed. Not only was our army not eliminated, but it was greatly expanded with the support of the broad masses of people. At that time, the troops had grown to more than 3,000 people, and the Water East Independent Regiment was formally established in the spring of 1940. Under the active operations of our army, the enemy suffered severe blows, their ferocity greatly diminished, bandits were eliminated, and the people began to enjoy a relatively safe life. However, at this time, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale offensive against our Water East Liberated Area. When the Japanese army attacked, the Kuomintang troops fled to the west of the river and the Yellow River flooded area for refuge, handing the people of Water East over to the enemy. For three years, they had not made any attacks on the enemy, but at this time they were so mad that they did not fight the enemy, but instead attempted to drive our army out of Water East and hand the already liberated people of Water East back to the enemy. Under the command of Tang Enbo, they dispatched the 81st Division and other troops, in coordination with local enemy puppets, to launch a major offensive against our army. On April 17, 1941, in the south of Qixian, they buried alive Comrade Han Dasheng, the secretary of the CCP Water East Regional Committee, and more than 20 others, and successively massacred more than 1,000 of our soldiers and civilians. However, our army was not driven out because of this, and still steadfastly persisted in the Water East area. And these Kuomintang troops, who were "brave in internal war," soon collapsed again under the sweeping of the Japanese army and fled back to the west of the river. As for the Kuomintang regime in various places in Water East, after the Japanese invaders occupied the counties in Yudong in 1938, they all fled into the Yellow River flooded area, and all they did was collect taxes and demand food, exploiting the people and never leading the people to carry out any anti-Japanese work. Therefore, at the enthusiastic request of the broad masses of people, our Water East Joint Defense Office was established in August of that year. Local mass leader Comrade Cui Ting was unanimously elected by the people as the director of the office. At the beginning of 1942, joint defense offices were successively established in the four counties of Qitong, Qibei, Qinan, and Suitai. At this point, our Water East Liberated Area began to develop and consolidate. In the spring of 1943, the Water East area was placed under the leadership of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, and the Fanshui Second Military Sub-district was formally established. In 1944, the Japanese launched a large-scale invasion of the Central Plains, and the Kuomintang army of 400,000 collapsed at the first touch. Most of Henan Province was lost, and the Kuomintang troops fleeing in the Yellow River flooded area and the Kuomintang exile regimes in various counties of Yudong successively betrayed the country and surrendered to the enemy. Qu Weihan, the commissioner of the 12th Administrative Region of Henan Province of the Kuomintang, could not maintain the situation and automatically announced the dissolution of the commissioner's office. Since the Kuomintang abandoned the broad masses of people in Yudong, our Water East Joint Defense Office formally established the Sixth Commissioner's Office of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region at the request of the people, and changed all the joint defense offices of the counties into county governments. In the spring of 1945, in order to save the people west of the river, our Water East Liberation Army dispatched a large number of troops to advance into the new Yellow River, and defeated the enemy puppets, cleared strongholds, west to the Pinghan Railway, and south to the Huai River, opening up the Water West Liberated Area including the vast areas of Yanling, Fugou, Xihua, Shangcai, and Shangshui counties, and stormed into the city of Fubian County. After the enemy surrendered, our Yudong Liberation Army launched a full-scale counter-offensive against the enemy puppets with thunderous force, successively recovering the four county towns of Qixian, Tongxu, Xihua, and Taikang, as well as countless other large and small strongholds. In these eight years of arduous war, according to not very accurate statistics, our army fought 4,909 times, killing and capturing a total of 623 Japanese soldiers and 9,229 puppet soldiers, seizing five cannons, 215 light and heavy machine guns, and 7,747 rifles and horses, liberating five county towns, more than 8,200 villages and towns, a population of about 3.6 million, and liberated territory of more than 40,000 square li. These achievements are the result of the sacrifices and bloodshed of our Yudong Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army. In the battle, 5,266 cadres and soldiers below the level of Brigade Political Commissar Tang Kewei, Regional Committee Secretary Han Dasheng, and Regiment Political Commissar Ma Qinghua were killed or wounded. At the same time, our Yudong Liberation Army and the anti-Japanese democratic government also led the people to carry out disaster relief, Yellow River management, land reclamation, rent reduction, and interest reduction. During the spring famine in 1943, our military and government personnel ate chaff and vegetables for as long as two months, and even ate tree bark, saving two ounces of grain per person per day to provide relief to the victims. In order to prevent the Yellow River from flooding, our Yudong democratic government allocated a total of 100,000 yuan and 180,000 jin of grain five times, mobilizing the people of Fugou, Taikang, and Xihua counties to build 51 li of embankments, saving 5.2 million mu of good land. Our Water East troops also personally helped the returning disaster victims to open up more than 20,000 mu of cultivated wasteland. These touching historical facts have been permanently preserved in the hearts of the broad masses of people in Yudong, which cannot be covered up by Kuomintang warmongering elements no matter what.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries are unwilling to see the people of Yudong liberated. Instead of collecting enemy and puppet armed forces, they actively instigated the enemy and puppets in mid-September last year, using the 55th Army, 68th Army, 15th Army, and the Provisional 1st Division of the 47th Army, a total of about 70,000 troops, to surround our Yudong Liberated Area from all sides from Huaiyang, Shangqiu, Kaifeng, and other places, and launched a full-scale and fierce civil war against us. On October 7th, they occupied Fugou City, and within six days, they successively captured Taikang and Xihua cities. On the 9th, they occupied Tongxu City, and on the 14th, they attacked Qixian City. For the sake of peace, our army painfully withdrew from the Water West Liberated Area. But the Kuomintang was not satisfied, and launched continuous mopping-up operations in our Water East area. Wherever the Kuomintang army went, they committed all kinds of crimes, including rape, arson, killing, and looting. On September 16th, the 375th Regiment of the 119th Division in Yuzhenji, Qixian County, buried alive 12 villagers, including Liang Xuhuo, at one time. On the same day, in Liuzhai Village, the 356th Regiment of the 119th Division raped 48 women in the village in turn. Wang Peisong and other five people in Wangji, Taikang, were extorted a total of 570,000 yuan in silver dollars. In total, during this period, the Kuomintang army killed 236 people in our liberated areas, burned 145 houses, raped 1,203 women, extorted 2,170,500 yuan in silver dollars from the people, and robbed grain and clothing worth about 5,893,000 yuan in silver dollars. The soldiers and civilians in our Water East Liberated Area could no longer bear it, and rose up in self-defense, forcing the Kuomintang army to retreat to the county seat. But the Kuomintang army still took the opportunity to attack us from time to time. Even after the ceasefire on January 13th, they continued to attack our army, with as many as 53 large-scale invasions of more than 200 people. On March 14th, the 81st Division, with two regiments, divided its forces into three routes and occupied Fuji, Qixian County. On March 20th, the entire 81st Division launched a fierce attack on our troops stationed in Zhaocun, Liuzhai, and Mazhuang, killing and wounding 31 platoon leaders and lower ranks. However, under the efforts of all the soldiers and civilians in our Water East Liberated Area, the Kuomintang army's conspiracy to destroy our Water East Liberated Area completely failed again.
    Now, in our Water East Liberated Area, north to the Longhai Railway (east from Tianzhuang Station to Xingzhiyuan Station), west to the new Yellow River, and south to the vast area along the line of Daiji, Anping, Zhanggong, and Tianzhuang in Xihua and Huaiyang, except for the county seat and a few market towns such as Fuji occupied by the Kuomintang, all the vast villages are still under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Military Sub-district of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region of our Water East Eighth Route Army. There are 5,400 villages in our liberated area, with an area of about 32,000 square li and a population of 2.44 million.
    These ironclad facts cannot be obliterated by the Kuomintang's fabrications and lies. Historical facts cannot be changed at will. The Kuomintang's shameless rumors are just a trick of reactionary conspirators, attempting to use the denial of the existence of our Water East Liberated Area as an excuse to launch a large-scale offensive against us.
    Now this offensive has begun. Since the 11th of this month, the Kuomintang has successively occupied the Changgang, Yindian, Wagang, Zhuanlou, Chaozhuang area in the southwest thirty to forty li of Suixian, which is our hinterland. On the 14th, the 81st Division and another unit of the Suixian Security Corps invaded Houzigang. Our Yudong soldiers and civilians are now fighting fiercely with the stubborn puppets in the Suixian, Qixian, and Taikang areas to defend democracy and peace. The soldiers and civilians tempered by eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to defend their own interests, know what to do, and are now doing what they should do. The warmongering elements of the Kuomintang have torn up the ceasefire agreement and launched a civil war. The people of Yudong have seen their hideous faces clearly.

　　豫东解放区介绍
    四月十日，在新乡举行国共参谋长会议上，国民党代表郑州绥署参谋长赵子立氏，满口撒谎，竟谬称：“豫东在一月十三日前并无中共部队，企图否认我豫东解放区的存在，以为发动大规模内战的口实。五月八日国民党又向新乡小组提出备忘录，否认元月十四日前，有我豫东八路军存在的事实。这是国民党好战分子准备发动内战行动的一部分。
    豫东解放区原包括水东（新黄河以东），水西两部分，远在一九三八年五月郑州会战时，日军大举进犯豫东，国民党军不战而溃，闻风逃窜。杞县、睢县、太康等城先后沦于敌手。中国共产党员吴芝圃、王介甫、王徕文等，即结合当地抗日志士，成立新四军抗日三支队，转战于睢县、杞县、通许、太康地区，领导豫东人民积极打击敌伪，开创了水东抗日游击根据地，同年五月，新四军彭雪枫将军从竹沟率部东进，与三支队在西华一带会合，乃合编为新四军抗日游击大队。年底抗日游击大队大部继续东进，深入敌后，到达安徽、河南、江苏三省交界处之毫州、永城、萧县地区，创立豫皖苏边区，即现在华中之淮北军区，仍留冯胜、马庆华等同志领导游击大队，继续坚持水东地区斗争。此时豫东地区汉奸武装遍地滋生，土匪到处横行，敌人则不断的向我军进行疯狂的扫荡，环境异常艰险，但我军仍继续不屈不挠的抗击敌伪，并主动的去袭击敌人。就在一九三九年春，我军在杞县公路上伏击敌人的战斗中，我大队政委马庆华同志光荣的牺牲了。经过一年的艰苦奋斗，敌人消灭我军的企图，完全失败了，我军不仅未被消灭，在广大民众的拥护下，反而大大的扩大了。当时部队已发展至三千余人，遂于一九四零年春正式成立水东独立团。在我军积极的作战下，敌人遭受了严重的打击，凶焰大减，土匪也肃清了，人民开始得到了比较安全的生活。然而就在这个时候，国民党反动派对我水东解放区发动了大规模攻势，日寇进攻时，国民党军队望风逃到河西及黄泛区去避难，把水东人民拱手送给敌人。三年来未曾丝毫对敌人作过任何攻击，此时却丧心病狂放着敌人不打，竟妄图将我军逐出水东，把水东已解放了的民众，重交敌人。在汤恩伯的指挥下，派遣了八十一师等部队，配合当地敌伪疯狂的向我军发动了大举进攻，于四一年四月十七日在杞县南，将我中共水东地区地委书记韩达生同志等二十余人活埋，先后屠杀我军民达千余名之多，但是我军并未因此而被逐出，依然坚定不移的坚持了水东地区。而这些“勇于内战”的国民党军队，却不久便在日寇的扫荡下，再次的溃败回河西去了。至于水东各地的国民党政权，自三八年日寇侵陷豫东各县后，即已悉数逃入黄泛区，整日唯以征款、要粮剥削为能事，从未领导人民作过丝毫抗日工作。因此，在广大人民的热烈要求下，我水东联防办事处乃于是年八月成立，经人民一致推选当地群众领袖崔廷同志为办事处主任，并于一九四二年初，相继建立了杞通、杞北、杞南、睢太等四个县的联防办事处。至此，我水东解放区开始走上了发展与巩固的阶段。四三年春，水东区划归冀鲁豫边区领导，乃正式建立泛水二军分区。四四年日本大举进犯中原，国民党大军四十万，一触即溃，河南省大部失守，逃窜在黄泛区里的国民党军队及豫东各县国民党流亡政权，相继叛国投敌。国民党河南十二专区专员屈维汉，无法维持，自动宣布专署解散。国民党既抛弃豫东广大人民于不顾，我水东联防办事处始应人民之请，正式成立冀鲁豫第六专员公署，并将各县联防办事处，一律改为县政府。四五年春，我水东解放军，为了拯救水西民众，乃派遣大批部队挺进新黄河，并打退敌伪，扫除据点，西至平汉线，南抵淮河，开辟了包括鄢陵、扶沟、西华、上蔡、商水等县广大地区的水西解放区，且一举攻入扶边县城。敌寇投降后，我豫东解放军更以雷霆万钧之势，对敌伪发动全面反攻，接连收复杞县、通许、西华、太康四个县城，以及其他大小据点无数。在这八年的艰苦战争中，仅根据不甚精确的统计，我军即作战四九○九次，共毙俘日军六二三名，毙俘伪军九二二九名，缴获大炮五门，轻重机枪二一五挺，步马枪七七四七只，共解放县城五座，村镇八千二百余处，人口约三百六十余万，解放国土达四万余平方华里。而这些战绩，都是我豫东八路军、新四军牺牲流血得到的成果。在战斗中，我伤亡旅政委唐克威，地委书记韩达生，团政委马庆华以下干部及战士五二六六名。同时，我豫东解放军及抗日民主政权，并领导人民进行了救灾、治黄、开荒、减租、减息等工作。当四三年春荒时期，我军政人员曾有两月之久，吃糠咽菜，甚至采食树皮，每人每日节约粮食二两拿来赈济灾民。而为了防止黄河泛滥，我豫东民主政权曾五次共拨款十万元，拨粮十八万斤，发动扶（沟）、太（康）、西（华）三县民众修堤五十一华里，救出良田五百二十万亩。我水东部队又亲自动手，帮助回乡灾民开出熟荒二万余亩。这些可歌可泣的史迹，已永远存留在豫东广大人民的心里，这是国民党好战分子无论如何也不能掩盖的。
    国民党反动派不愿看到我豫东人民得到解放，不去收缴敌伪武装，却积极策动敌伪于去年九月中旬，以五十五军六十八军十五军，及四十七军之暂一师等七个师，共约七万之众，自淮阳、商邱、开封等地四面包围我豫东解放区，向我发动全面猛烈内战，于十月七日，占我扶沟城，六日连陷我太康、西华两城，九日又攻占我通许城，十四日更进攻我杞县城，我军为了和平，忍痛退出水西解放区。但国民党意犹未足，复在我水东地区展开连续不断的清剿扫荡。国民党军队所到之处，奸淫烧杀抢掠，无所不为。九月十六日，在杞县圉镇集一一九师三七五团，一次即活埋村民梁叙合等十二名。同日在刘寨村，一一九师三五六团轮奸强奸该村妇女达四十八人。仅太康王集王培松等五人，即被讹诈大洋五十七万元。总计在这一时期内，国民党军队共杀死我解放区民众二三六人，烧毁房屋一四五间，奸淫妇女一二○三人，讹诈民众大洋二一七○五万元，抢去粮食衣服等约值洋五八九三万元，我水东解放区军民忍无可忍，乃奋起自卫，迫使国民党军队退守县城。但国民党军队仍不时乘隙向我进袭，即在元月十三日和平停战后，亦继续不断向我军进攻，仅二百人以上较大规模之进犯，即达五十三次之多，并于三月十四日八十一师以二个团之众，分兵三路，进占我杞县之傅集。三月二十日，更以八十一师全师兵力，连续向我驻赵村、刘寨、马庄部队发动猛攻，死伤我排长以下三十一名。然而在我水东解放区全体军民的努力自卫之下，国民党军队企图摧毁我水东解放区的阴谋，又完全破产了。
    现在我水东解放区北界陇海铁路（东起田庄车站，西至杏枝园车站），西至新黄河，南抵西华、淮阳代集、安平、张弓、田庄一线之广大地区内，除县城及傅集等几个集镇被国民党侵占外，所有广大的村庄仍然在我水东八路军冀鲁豫第六军分区管辖之下。我解放区共有村庄五千四百个，面积约三万二千平方华里，人口达二百四十四万。
    这些铁一般的事实，绝不是国民党捏造撒谎所能抹煞的，历史的事实是绝不能随意改换的，国民党的这种无耻的造谣，只不过是反动派阴谋家的一个鬼计，企图以否认我水东解放区的存在为借口，向我发动大规模的进攻。
    现在这种进攻开始了，自本月十一日起国民党已经先后占领了我睢县西南三四十里之我腹心地区长岗、尹店、瓦岗、砖楼、潮庄一带；十四日八十一师与睢县保安团队另一部进犯我厚子岗。我豫东军民为保卫民主，保卫和平，现正在睢县、杞县、太康地区与顽伪激战中。经过八年抗战锻炼的军民，为了保卫自己的利益，他们知道应该怎样做，现在是按应该做的做了。国民党好战分子，撕毁停战协定，发动内战，它的狞恶面孔，豫东人民是看得清清楚楚的了。
