　　Kuomintang's Perverse Actions: Not Rescuing Disaster Victims but Rescuing Puppet Troops
    Border Region Relief Association Sends Telegram to the Nation Protesting
    [Our Special Dispatch] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Relief Association, regarding the reactionary Kuomintang's perverse actions of airlifting large quantities of ammunition, flour, and large pancakes to supply the puppet troops in Yongnian, while failing to provide relief to the vast disaster-stricken population in the liberated areas who persisted in the eight-year War of Resistance, sent a telegram to the nation on the 14th of this month, calling for an immediate halt to the use of airplanes to transport supplies to puppet troops, to uphold justice, and to provide fair relief. The original telegram is as follows:
    To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Chairman Mao of Yan'an, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, all newspapers, and all relief organizations:
    Our liberated area has endured eight years of the War of Resistance and four years of famine. The sacrifices and losses of the people are unprecedentedly severe. Among the 28,514,368 people in the entire liberated area, 3,141,625 were killed by the enemy and puppets. 5,763,149 houses were burned down, and livestock and property were looted. Currently, 4,382,865 disaster victims urgently need relief. Their miserable situation has already been witnessed by Mr. An Dingyuan of UNRRA and Mr. Zhang Chongde of CNRRA. However, the National Government's enthusiasm and activeness in rescuing such a vast number of disaster victims cannot match its enthusiasm for rescuing the puppet troops in Yongnian. For the 2,000 puppet troops in Yongnian, the National Government regularly sends one or two airplanes to transport ammunition, flour, and large pancakes, as many as three times a day. The 6,370 residents within the city walls, however, have not received a single share. Some disaster victims are beaten for picking up pancake crumbs from the ground, and most of their houses have been damaged by the packages. More than twenty innocent people have been killed by the packages. The foreign flour and large pancakes transported by the puppet troops by airplane are used to feed more than two thousand fat pigs, raising strong riding horses and mules. In contrast, the vast number of disaster victims who struggled for national survival and persisted in the eight-year War of Resistance are not as well off as the traitorous and evil-doing Han traitors and puppet troops. Where is humanity? Where is justice? Our branch association appeals on behalf of the disaster victims of the entire region and pleads for the innocent people of Yongnian: immediately cease the brutal act of using airplanes to transport supplies to puppet troops and killing people. We implore our government, UNRRA, CNRRA, all relief organizations, and people from all walks of life to uphold justice and provide fair relief. The disaster victims in our liberated area do not dare to ask for better treatment than the puppet troops; they only ask to be treated the same as the puppet troops. Urgent telegram, please decide accordingly.
                                    Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Relief Association, respectfully

　　国民党倒行逆施不救灾民救伪军
    边区救济分会通电全国抗议
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区救济分会，顷就国民党反动派倒行逆施，以大批弹药、面粉、大饼空运供给永年伪军，而对坚持八年抗战的解放区广大灾民，反不予救济，特于本月十四日，通电全国，呼吁立即停止用飞机给伪军运送物资，主持正义，公平救济。原电如下：
    国府蒋主席、延安毛主席、北平执行部钧鉴，各报馆、各救济团体公鉴：
    本解放区八年抗战，四年灾荒，人民之牺牲损失空前严重，全解放区二千八百五十一万四千三百六十八人中，被敌伪残杀者达三百一十四万一千六百二十五人。烧毁房屋五百七十六万三千一百四十九间，牲畜财物，抢劫殆尽，目前急待救济之灾民四百三十八万二千八百六十五人，惨苦情状，已为联总安定远、行总张崇德两先生所目睹，然国民政府对救济如此广大灾民，反不及救济永年伪军之热心积极，永年伪军两千人，而国民政府经常派飞机一架二架不等，运送弹药、面粉、大饼，每日竟有三次之多。而城内居民六千三百七十人，则未得分毫，灾民有在地上拾饼屑而遭打者，且大部房屋均被包裹砸坏，二十余口无辜人民已被包裹砸死。伪军用飞机运送的洋面、大饼，喂着二千余口肥猪，养着肥壮的乘马驮骡，相形之下，为国家民族争生存、坚持八年抗战的广大灾民，反不及祸国殃民、助纣为虐的汉奸伪军。人道何在？公理何存？本分会为全区灾民呼吁，为永年无辜人民请命，立即停止用飞机给伪军运送物资、砸死人民之残暴行为。恳请我政府、联总行总、各救济团体、各界同胞，主持正义，公平救济。本解放区灾民，不敢要求优于伪军，只求能与伪军同样救济足矣。迫切电函，诸乞公裁。
