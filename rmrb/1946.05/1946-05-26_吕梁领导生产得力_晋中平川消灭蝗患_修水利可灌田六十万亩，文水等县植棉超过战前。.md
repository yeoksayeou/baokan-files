　　[Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 23rd] This year, the Lüliang area's spring plowing and large-scale production have been successful due to effective leadership in handling three major tasks: (1) The repair and dredging of the Wenyuhe River and Fenhe River projects (including drainage, flood prevention, irrigation, etc.) running through the Jinzhong Plains of Wenshui, Fenyang, Pingyao, Jiexiu, etc., has been completed, irrigating a total of 600,000 mu of land, exceeding the original plan by nearly double. (2) In the Jinzhong Plains area, more than 100,000 people were mobilized to dig up eggs and kill nymphs, preventing the locust plague from spreading. During the enemy and puppet regime's rule, the locust plagues in the area were severe. According to statistics from over 140 villages in Wenshui, Fenyang, and Pingyao counties, over 1.3 million mu of farmland were affected, resulting in a loss of over 600,000 shi of grain. Now, the locust disaster has been eradicated. (3) In the Jinzhong Plains area, cotton fields in Wenshui, Pingyao, Jiexiu, Fenyang, Yangqu, Qingyuan, and other counties have now exceeded pre-war levels, and seedlings have been planted. This area was originally a famous cotton-producing area in Shanxi. During the enemy occupation, cotton fields were reduced by nine-tenths. In order to restore this huge cotton production, the democratic government provided large amounts of grain and loans, and adjusted cotton fields and cotton seeds. The masses said, "These things, Yan Xishan's rule for decades and the Japanese devils' occupation for seven or eight years, were never done. The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army have done them in half a year."

　　吕梁领导生产得力
    晋中平川消灭蝗患
    修水利可灌田六十万亩，文水等县植棉超过战前。
    【新华社兴县二十三日电】今年吕梁区的春耕大生产，由于领导得力，办好了三件大事：（一）修浚贯串晋中平川之文水、汾阳、平遥、介休等文峪河与汾河工程（包括退水、防止决口、浇地等），已大功告成，共灌地六十万亩，超过原计划将近一倍。（二）晋中平川地区，动员了十余万群众刨卵灭蝻，使蝗患未致蔓延。在敌伪统治时，该区蝗灾严重，据文水、汾阳、平遥三县一百四十余村统计，被害田地达一百三十万亩，损失粮食在六十万石以上，现蝗祸已告肃清。（三）晋中平川地区文水、平遥、介休、汾阳、阳曲、清源等县，现棉田已超过战前水平，且已全部捉苗。该地区原为山西有名的产棉区，敌占时期，棉田减少十分之九；民主政府为恢复此项巨大棉田，曾大量贷粮贷款，调剂棉田，棉籽，群众说：“这些事情，阎锡山统治几十年，日本鬼子占了七八年，都没有做，共产党八路军在半年内就做好了”。
