　　Byrnes' Broadcast Speech
    Discusses the Proceedings of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, Demonstrating Future U.S. Diplomatic Attitude
    Senator Pepper Criticizes Byrnes for Sabotaging the Foreign Ministers' Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] According to the U.S. Information Service, Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a broadcast speech to the nation on the 20th night, discussing the proceedings of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference and the future attitude of the United States. The following is a summary of Byrnes' speech:
    (1) Regarding the assessment of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Byrnes believes that "very little progress has been made toward peace," but states that "during the brief recess, we can re-examine our individual positions, which should help achieve an agreement when the conference resumes." "When the Foreign Ministers' Conference resumes, the U.S. representative will strive to reach an agreement on major issues." He believes that "laying the foundation for peace is a long and arduous task," and "cannot be solved by lightning-fast diplomatic victories."
    (2) Regarding the dispute over the Italian peace treaty, Byrnes repeated his three basic points at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, namely, his opinions on "reparations, the disposition of colonies, and the border between Italy and Yugoslavia." Regarding the issue of reparations, Byrnes said that the United States has "directly or indirectly advanced" a sum of money to Italy, and the United States is unwilling to "advance one million U.S. dollars to enable Italy to produce goods to pay reparations to any of the Allied countries." Byrnes stated: "The scope of the dispute regarding colonies has narrowed, but it remains unresolved." However, he pointed out: "The Soviet government has expressed its willingness to compromise on the issue of requesting trusteeship of Tripolitania," and "agrees with the original proposal put forward by France, namely, trusteeship by Italy." Byrnes said that he had then "expressed his willingness to accept the proposal put forward by France for entrusting Italy with governance," which was "out of necessity." When "the British proposed entrusting the British with the administration of Cyrenaica, and opinions diverged, I reiterated the original U.S. proposal to place the land under the trusteeship of the United Nations." As for the city of Trieste, Byrnes demanded concessions from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on the issue of the port of Trieste. He said: "We will continue to appeal to the Soviet and Yugoslav governments not to insist on this national boundary." Although the dispute over the disposition of Italian colonies (mainly a dispute between Britain and the United States, in addition to the Soviet concession) is no less than the dispute over the port of Trieste, Byrnes made every effort to emphasize the latter issue, saying: "If the Trieste issue can be resolved, it will not be difficult to reach an agreement on reparations, colonies, and other issues."
    (3) Regarding the peace treaties with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, he stated: "Failure to reach an agreement was mainly due to the conference's inconsistent attitude towards economic terms." Byrnes revealed that the Soviet Union refused to include the "freedom of Danube trade" proposed by the United States in the Balkan peace treaty terms. Byrnes believes that this indicates "Soviet refusal to open Central and Eastern Europe to the United States."
    (4) Regarding the German and Austrian issues, Byrnes reiterated the Four-Power Treaty on the disarmament of Germany for twenty-five years, which he announced at the Paris Conference. He said that the Soviet Union refused to sign this treaty at present, and Molotov "first wanted to clarify whether Germany had implemented disarmament in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement," and was "deeply concerned that this treaty would delay the immediate disarmament of Germany." Byrnes admitted that "there is currently no German government that can accept this peace treaty," but he still advocated submitting this treaty to the peace conference for discussion. Regarding the Austrian peace treaty, he advocated making every effort to proceed. Byrnes revealed that his goal in advocating an immediate peace treaty with Austria was to weaken Soviet influence over Austria and the Balkans. He stated: "If Europe is to return to a state resembling peace, a peace treaty with Austria is indispensable. As long as there is no peace with Austria, and foreign troops are stationed on its territory, military lines of communication will continue to be maintained in Romania, Hungary, and Italy. Conversely, there will be no need for foreign troops to remain, except for Germany and a line of communication traversing Poland." Byrnes stated: "The German and Austrian issues will be raised again at the next Foreign Ministers' Conference."
    (5) Regarding the peace conference, Byrnes, on the one hand, strongly advocated that "when the current Foreign Ministers' Conference is held on June 15, it should complete the drafting of treaties to the extent possible." At the same time, Byrnes still expressed some objections to the Soviet Union's insistence, which was endorsed by the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, that the four powers must reach an agreement on all major issues before the peace conference is held. He said: "The date of the peace conference should be set for July 1 or July 15." The Foreign Ministers' Conference should "submit a draft of each treaty, and specify in the draft which issues have been agreed upon and which issues have not been agreed upon. This approach will allow all participating countries to freely discuss at the conference." He believes that the best approach is to submit all the decided and undecided issues of the four powers to the peace conference. "At that time, world opinion" will propose the final solution. Byrnes also stated that unless a peace conference is convened this summer, he will "request the United Nations General Assembly to make recommendations in accordance with the Charter's peaceful settlement of matters."
    Byrnes proclaimed that "we must launch an offensive for peace." He also said: "What peace requires is not the sacrifice of principles, but rather sacrifice for principles." What is the content of this "principle"? Byrnes did not explain in his speech. Byrnes also stated: "If we cannot cooperate in an indivisible peace, we may again need to cooperate in a war that spans the globe." Finally, Byrnes declared in his concluding remarks: "Our problems are indeed extremely serious, but I am not disappointed because of this. Our work to strive for peace has only just begun. We are determined to fight for political and economic peace in Europe, the Near East, and other regions. We will launch this work in terms of peace and the various councils of the United Nations. Our goal is peace, and peace can never be built on the basis of revenge or flattery."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Byrnes' report on the proceedings of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has aroused great indignation among progressive members of Congress. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 21st, Democratic Senator Pepper "sharply criticized" Byrnes for pursuing only the private interests of the United States, rather than genuine peace. Pepper stated: Byrnes sabotaged the Foreign Ministers' Conference. If Byrnes were willing to make an effort to understand the Soviet point of view, as he diligently understands Britain's, then his peace offensive would have greater success; as long as they believe that Britain and the United States are trying to maintain peace solely for the benefit of their own countries, there will be no peace.

    论述巴黎外长会议经过表明今后美国外交态度
    参议员泼贝尔抨击贝纳斯破坏外长会议
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据美新闻处华府讯：美国务卿贝纳斯二十日夜向全国发表广播演说，论述巴黎外长会议的经过及美国今后的态度，兹将贝氏演讲摘要如下：
    （一）对外长会议的估计，贝氏认为“对和平所作之进步甚微”，但称“在短促之休会期中，吾人可以重新检讨吾人之个别立场，此当可助于会议重开时获得协议”。“外长会议重开时，美代表将竭力对各主要问题获致协议”。他认为“建立和平的基础乃一久长而艰苦之工作”，“非闪电式之外交胜利所能解决”。
    （二）关于对意和约之争执，贝氏重复了其在外长会议中三个基本问题，即“赔偿、殖民地处理及意大利与南斯拉夫之边界”问题的意见。关于赔偿问题，贝氏说美国已“直接或间接垫付”意国一笔款项，美国不愿“垫付一百万美元，使意大利能生产货物，以资偿付盟国中任何一国之赔偿”。贝氏称：“关于殖民地之争执范围已见缩小，但仍未解决”。但指出：“苏联政府对于要求代管的黎波里坦尼亚一事，已表示让步”，“赞成法国所提原来建议，即由意大利托管”。贝氏说他当时曾“表示愿意接受法国所提委托意大利管制之提案”，“实出于不得已”，当“英人提议委托英人管制昔兰尼加各方意见分歧之时，余遂重提美国原建议案，拟将该项土地置于联合国托治之下”。至于的里雅斯特城，贝氏要求苏联和南斯拉夫在的港问题上让步，他说：“吾人将继续吁请苏南两国政府，勿坚持此国境界线。”虽然关于意大利殖民地处理问题的争执（在苏联让步上主要是英美间的争执），不亚于的港问题的争执，但贝氏尽力强调后一问题，他说：“如的里雅斯特问题能告解决，则关于赔偿与殖民地及其他若干问题，当不难取得协议”。
    （三）关于罗、匈、保和约问题，他称：“未能获得协议，主要乃因会议对经济条款态度不一致。”贝纳斯透露苏联拒绝将美国所提之“多脑河贸易自由”一项附入对巴尔干和约条款中，贝氏认为此乃表示“苏拒绝中欧及东欧之向美国门户开放”。
    （四）关于德、奥问题，贝纳斯重申其在巴黎会议上宣布之关于解除德国武装二十五年之四强条约，他说苏联拒绝目前签订此条约，莫洛托夫“首先愿明了德国是否已依照波茨顿协定实行解除武装”，并“深恐是项条约将阻延德国武装之立即解除”。贝氏承认“目下尚无德国政府能接受此和平条约”，但他仍主张将此和约提交和会讨论。关于对奥和约问题，他主张尤须极力进行，贝氏透露其力主对奥立即作成和约之目的，乃在减弱苏联对奥及对巴尔干之影响。他称：“欲使欧洲恢复形似和平之情形，非对奥国作成和平条约不可，对奥一日无和平，及其领土上驻有外国军队一日，则军事交通线将继续维持于罗、匈及意国，反之，则外国军队除德国及横贯波兰之一条交通线外，即无留一兵一卒之必要。”贝氏称：“德奥问题将于下次外长会上再度提出”。
    （五）关于和会问题，贝氏一方面力主“本届外长会议于六月十五日举行时，应在可能范围之内，完成起草条约工作”。同时，贝氏对于苏联所坚持的而为巴黎外长会议所赞同的，在和平会议举行以前，四强对于各项重大问题必须获得协议的主张，仍表示若干异议。他说：“和会举行日期，应确定为七月一日，或七月十五日”。外长会议应“提出每一条约之草案，并于草案之内详载某某问题已获协议，某某问题未获协议。此种办法，可使所有参战国家在会中自由讨论”。他认为最佳者，是将四强一切已决定未决之问题，提交和会。“其时世界舆论”将提出最后解决之途。贝氏并称，除非于今夏召开和会，否则他将“请求联合国大会按宪章之和平解决事项，提出建议。”
    贝氏声称“必须为和平发动攻势”，他又说：“和平所需者并非主义之牺牲，而实为主义而牺牲。”这一“主义”的内容是什么？贝氏演说中未加说明。贝氏并称：“苟不能在不可分之和平中合作，则或将再度需要在遍及全球之战争中合作。”最后贝氏在其结语中宣称：“吾人之问题固极严重，惟余并不因是其失望，吾人争取和平之工作仅仅宣告展开，吾人决为争取欧洲近东及其他地区之政治及经济和平而奋斗。吾人将就和平及联合国各理事会等方面，展开此项工作。吾人之目标，即系和平，和平绝难建立于报复或谄媚之基础上。”
    【新华社延安二十六日电】贝纳斯关于外长会议经过的报告，在国会进步议员中引起了极大的愤慨。据美联社华府二十一日电称：民主党参议员泼贝尔，“尖锐抨击”贝纳斯所追求者仅美国之私利，而非真正之和平。泼贝尔称：贝纳斯破坏了外长会议，假如贝纳斯肯努力去了解苏联的观点，象他努力地了解英国一样，那么他的和平攻势就会有更大成功；只要他们以为英美企图保持和平仅仅是为了自己国家的利益，那末是不会有和平的。
