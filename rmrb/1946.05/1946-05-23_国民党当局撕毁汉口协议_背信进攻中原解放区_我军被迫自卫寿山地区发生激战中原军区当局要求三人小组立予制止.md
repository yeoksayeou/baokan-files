　　Kuomintang Authorities Tear Up the Hankou Agreement
　　Treacherously Attack the Central Plains Liberated Area
　　Our Troops are Forced to Defend Themselves, Fierce Fighting Erupts in the Shoushan Area; The Central Plains Military Region Authorities Demand the Three-Person Group Immediately Stop It
　　[Xinhua News Agency Xuanhuaidian, 18th Urgent Telegram] The ink on the Military Three-Person Group's Hankou Agreement was barely dry when the Kuomintang authorities violated the agreement. On the 16th, they launched a six-pronged attack on the Ping-Han Railway, Xian’an and Yingshan Liberated Areas. The invading forces were composed of the Kuomintang’s 66th Army, 13th Division, and the 75th Army's 6th Division, as well as local troops from Yingshan. The central combined target was the Shoushan Liberated Area, 40 li southwest of Yingshan. The first route moved south from the area north of Dabangdian (more than 30 li north of Shoushan). The second route moved southwest from Weijiadian (more than 10 li northwest of Yingshan), passing through Daluwan, Maojiadian, Gaojiawan, Sunjiaguan and other places, attacking Tangjiawan and Qujiazui, north of Shoushan. The third route moved southeast from Changlinggang (about 10 li slightly north of Yingshan), passing through Yujiamiao and Sunjiawan, attacking Wanjiazui and Bijia Mountain, northwest of Shoushan. The fourth route moved northeast from Pinglinshi (more than 10 li southwest of Shoushan), passing through Rongshizui, Caojiawan, and Zaoshulin, attacking the area south of Shoushan. The fifth route moved west from Jieguting (more than 10 li east of Shoushan), passing through Qiaotouwan and Lishuwang, attacking the southeastern area of Shoushan. The sixth route moved southwest from Chenjiaxiang (more than 10 li northeast of Shoushan), passing through Wangjiawan and Chenjiazui, attacking the area east of Xinjie. All the above routes launched simultaneous attacks at 8:00 AM on May 16th, initially using heavy and light machine guns and artillery to form a dense network of fire, fiercely attacking the area around Shoushan. Our troops, in order to survive, were forced to defend themselves, and fierce fighting is now underway in the Shoushan area. The Central Plains Military Region authorities have made a request to the Military Three-Person Group to immediately stop this perfidious attack by the Kuomintang reactionaries.
　　[Xinhua News Agency Yan'an, 20th Telegram] Today, this agency provides a comprehensive military summary: (1) On the Sipingjie front, the Nationalists are using American-made tanks and airplanes, and the battle situation is becoming increasingly fierce. South of Benxi, the Qiaotou Railway Station and Caohekou Railway Station on the An-Shen Railway were bombed by Kuomintang airplanes on the 4th and 5th. On the Beining Railway, American troops have recently increased their forces by more than 500 in the Tangshan to Kaiping area. In recent days, the Kuomintang army, under the protection of the American army, has continued to be transported to the Northeast. (2) The Kuomintang's 13th Army, 92nd Army, 94th Army, and parts of the 16th Army, leading 15,000 puppet troops from Tongxian, Wuqing and other counties, invaded the Yongding River’s northern area of the Jizhong Liberated Area. On the 15th, they occupied Anci County, and on the 16th, they occupied Panggezhuang north of Gu'an, and Hancun and other places west of Anci. Fierce fighting is taking place in all areas. (3) The Kuomintang army, in violation of the Hankou Agreement and the mediation orders of the Thirty-Two Executive Group, attacked the Shoushan area west of the Ping-Han Railway in the Central Plains Military Region on the 16th. On the same day, they also attacked the Pi (Huangpi)-An (Huang'an) southern area east of the railway. (4) The Kuomintang army in Jinan attacked the Licheng Liberated Area, occupying dozens of villages and towns. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, and on the 16th, it recovered Zhonggong Town. Furthermore, the Yudong (Eastern Henan) army and people repelled the Kuomintang and puppet army's attack and recovered HeYangji. (5) In addition, south of Taizhou, units of the Kuomintang 100th Army attacked the edge of the First Division of Suwan (Jiangsu-Anhui), occupying several villages and towns. In Jinzhong, Yan Xishan's army, in conjunction with the Japanese army and puppet forces under Yang Cheng, launched 17 attacks on Qinggou, Xugou and other areas from the 7th to the 14th.
