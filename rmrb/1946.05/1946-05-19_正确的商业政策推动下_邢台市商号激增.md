　　Under the impetus of correct commercial policies,
    Xingtai City Sees a Surge in Businesses
    [Xingtai City News] Merchants in Xingtai City, through their practical experience in the half-year since liberation, have come to recognize the commercial policies of our democratic government and are working together to develop commerce. The city is now thriving, with a rapid increase in the number of businesses. Before the war, the city had 1,270 stationary merchants. After seven or eight years of enemy and puppet rule, this number had dwindled to only 937 when our army liberated Xingtai. Now, the number has surged to 1,589, an increase of one-quarter compared to pre-war levels. While there were 534 street vendors during the Grand Temple Fair in November of last year, this number has now surged to 1,118. In addition, there are 38 new fur shops, 16 coal stations, and 17 hemp shops. Including public-private joint ventures, there are a total of 139 new businesses, not included in the aforementioned numbers of stationary merchants. In order to develop industry and commerce, our democratic government has established a reasonable burden system and abolished many exorbitant taxes and levies of the past. When collecting funds at the beginning of the year, the total amount levied from merchants was only 3.7 million yuan. This has prompted merchants to voluntarily compare the present government with the past. They said: "In the past, formal taxes included central taxes, provincial taxes, and county fees, totaling 11 million yuan every six months. The additional, informal taxes were more than four times the formal taxes, completely without limit, making it impossible to do business. Now things are much better."
    Clerks have had their salaries increased, while also taking care of the owners. Wage standards are determined through discussions and negotiations between both parties. The principle of regulation and mutual benefit is adopted in labor-capital relations. Clerks' morale is high, and managers and owners are also satisfied. From November of last year to the end of March of this year, the government issued 28.74 million yuan in commercial loans to 1,011 large and small shops (of which 823 were small businesses), which has played a significant role in the development of commerce.

　　正确的商业政策推动下
    邢台市商号激增
    【邢台市讯】邢台市商人，在解放后半年来的实际体验中，认识了我民主政府的商业政策后，协力从事商业建设，现该市市都繁荣，商号激增。该市战前坐商一千二百七十户，经过七八年敌伪统治后，在我军解放邢台时仅为九百卅七户，现已激增至一千五百八十九户；较战前增多四分之一。虽贩在去年十一月大庙会时为五百三十四户，现激增至一千一百一十八户。此外，又新增皮毛店三十八户，煤站十六处，麻店十七处，连公营商业，共新增一百三十九处，这都不包括在上述坐商数字中。我民主政府为发展工商业，确定了合理的负担制度，取消了过去许多苛捐杂税；年初征款时，向商人所征的总共不过三百七十万元。这引起商人们自动与过去政府作比较，他们说：“过去正税有中央税、省税、县款的、半年就要出一千一百万元；而附加的非正式税则要超过正税四倍，完全无限制，使买卖没法做，现在可好了。”
    店员增了资，同时也照顾了东家，工资标准是双方各自讨论后又协商订定的，劳资关系上采取了调节互利的原则，店员情绪高涨，经理东家也能满意。去年十一月至今年三月底，政府发放商业贷款二千八百七十四万元，贷给大小商店一千零十一家（其中小商占八百二十三户），这对商业发展起了相当作用。
