　　Xuzhou: A Dark and Hopeless Place
　　The people are burdened with heavy taxes and levies, living without means, and many women are reduced to prostitution.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 20th] Under the rule of the Kuomintang, Xuzhou is plagued by endless exorbitant taxes and levies, with so-called autumn levies, surcharges, advances, grain loans, requisitioning, and other pretexts. For grain levies alone, it is stipulated that each mu must pay ten jin, eight jin, or six jin, and so on, collected several times a month, leaving the people in utter desperation. According to a survey by the Xuzhou Post-War Relief Association Federation, there are more than 280,000 refugees without clothing, food, or shelter. Over 18,000 people are gathered in the urban area of Xuzhou. The number of displaced young women forced into prostitution is very high. Xuzhou's "Golden Valley Street," where prostitution is concentrated, is particularly "prosperous." In just over ten brothels, there are three to four hundred prostitutes. At night, the lights are bright, and Kuomintang military officers stream in and out, forming a stark contrast with the starving people on the streets.

　　徐州暗无天日
    人民苛杂繁重，生活无着，妇女多沦为娼妓。
    【新华社淮阴二十日电】国民党统治下的徐州，苛捐杂税层出不穷，有所谓秋征、加征、借支、借粮、出征等等名目，仅征粮一项，即规定每亩征收十斤、八斤、六斤不等，且月征数次，人民生活陷入绝境。据徐州善后救济协会联合会调查，无衣无食无住之难民，达二十八万余人，聚集徐州市区者，有一万八千余人，至流离失所之青年妇女，被迫为娼者，为数甚多。徐州娼妓集中之“金谷街”，特形“繁荣”，仅以十余家妓院计，妓女达三四百人，入晚灯光辉煌，国民党军官进出该地，川流不息，与流落街头之饥民适成强烈对照。
