    Chiang Kai-shek Expands Civil War
    Instructs Combat Troops to Seize Civilian Grain
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th dispatch] Moscow, 25th broadcast of American reporter's report on the Chinese war situation, TASS New York, 21st dispatch: The New York Post reporter stationed in Peiping reported: Not long ago, Bai Chongxi convened a meeting of combat personnel in Peiping. Bai Chongxi announced at the meeting the instructions of Chiang Kai-shek himself to expand the Chinese civil war. In this instruction, it was said that every combat unit in North China could seize or forcibly purchase grain to ensure sufficient food for itself; combat troops should mobilize among the residents to replenish their forces that had been weakened by the transfer to the Northeast; in North China, a joint guarantee system should be implemented, with ten to fifty households as a joint guarantee, and each household must be responsible for the actions of other families. The implementation of this system is to prevent residents from sympathizing with the Communist Party. Secondly, instructions ordered military headquarters in various places to do their utmost to carry out the civil war, regardless of the truce agreement, and to deploy their troops to where they were needed. The instruction pointed out that in places where military offensives were necessary, attacks should be launched against the Communist Party without asking for instructions from higher authorities. Bai Chongxi said: "Chairman Chiang ordered you to occupy Changchun." The New York Post reporter said: According to the opinions of American military representatives, Chiang Kai-shek's army in Manchuria would fail if it did not receive help from foreign troops. In order to carry out a war of self-defense and stop the attacking Kuomintang army, the Communist Party has now obtained the assistance of the broad masses of the people. Personnel from the U.S. Army Observer Group from Yan'an stated: The Communist Party does not want to completely control Manchuria, therefore, Marshall can achieve a truce between the two sides.

　　纽约邮报记者报导
    蒋介石扩大内战
    指示作战部队抢夺民粮
    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科二十五日播美国记者报导中国战况，塔斯社纽约二十一日电：纽约邮报驻北平记者报导：不久前白崇禧在平召集作战人员会议，白崇禧在会上通知关于蒋介石本人扩大中国内战的指示，在这一指示，说华北每一作战部队为了保证自己足够的粮食，可以夺取或强购粮食；作战部队应在居民中进行动员，补充其因转调东北而被削弱的部队；在华北须实施各家联保制度，十家到五十家为一联保，每一家对于其他家庭的行动，必须负责，执行这一制度，是为了防止居民同情共产党。其次指示命令各地军事司令部，不顾停战协定，竭力进行内战，把自己的军队调到必须的地方去。指示指出，在军事上必须进攻的地方，即向共产党展开进攻，勿庸向上级请示。白崇禧说：“蒋委员长命令你们占领长春。”纽约邮报记者说：据美国军事代表的意见，蒋介石在满洲军队如果得不到外国军队的帮助，就会失败。共产党为了进行自卫战，阻止进攻的国民党军，现已获得广大人民的援助。自延安来的美军观察组人员称：共产党并不是要完全管理满洲，因此，马歇尔可以达到使双方停战。
