　　Shitang District's Tenant-Landlord Arbitration Conference
    Xinhua News Agency, Huai'an Dispatch
    On March 20th, four thousand people from seven streets in Shitang District, Huai'an City, went to the city to settle accounts with landlords and overturned the stone tablet in anger (see our paper’s May 20th issue – Editor). They immediately returned to their villages and gathered separately to carry out liquidation. By the end of the month, part of the tenancy arbitration problem had been resolved. Some tenancy accounts, however, were not settled because landlords, failing to understand the greater good, refused to clear various extra exploitations such as advance borrowing of wheat and "pseudo-fees" according to the law. Public sentiment was indignant, and they demanded that the government mediate. At the same time, the landlords also requested the government to handle it quickly. Therefore, on April 4th, under the joint auspices of the Huai'an County Government, the Municipal Government, and the Shitang District Office, a tenant-landlord arbitration conference was convened. Below is a communication from the conference. From this, we can see the cruelty of landlords' exploitation of tenants, while the tenants are broad-minded.
     ——Editor
    April 4th left a profound impression on the people of Shitang District, Huai'an. They will never forget such a scene: in the auditorium of the Huai'an County Government, sat over sixty neatly dressed owners on one side, and over two hundred tenant farmer representatives dressed in rough clothes on the other. Both sides were stating their opinions, arguing until their faces turned red. This was the rent reduction arbitration conference in Shitang District, Huai'an.
    Before the meeting, the tenant and landlord sides had been brewing, and the government had also conducted detailed investigations and research. Therefore, both parties' representatives arrived complete. At 1:00 PM, Mayor Yin of Huaicheng announced the opening of the meeting, saying: Since the launch of the rent reduction and account settlement in Shitang District, it has been difficult for the landlord and tenant sides to resolve many issues at once; the government has simultaneously received application letters from both the owners and the tenant farmers, requesting mediation of the disputes between the two sides, so this meeting is convened.
    Then, both the landlord and tenant sides actively spoke. Lin Xiuwu, Zhao Lanting, Qin Shiliang, and others on the owner's side narrated the situation of this account settlement and inquired about the settlement standards. On the tenant side, the speaker was Wang Shugong. He spoke of the tenant's hardships and demanded the settlement of more than ten kinds of extra exploitations such as "rice watching fees." After the landlord and tenant spoke in succession, they entered arbitration. The first was to resolve the dispute between the owner Tang Renqian and the tenant farmers (Tang had one hundred and twenty-six mu of land in Jiaochang Township, and he himself was in Shanghai and had not returned, so the steward Wang Shuren represented him). Tenant representative Wang Shugong narrated the detailed accounts of various exploitations according to the bill. The first item, "pseudo-fees," caused a dispute. The owner's representative believed that there were fees in the countryside and fees in the streets, so the tenants should bear them. Tenant Wang Shugong was not convinced when he heard this. He immediately stood up and said loudly, "Pseudo-fees" are apportioned to the fields, and we pay rent for planting your land. If you yourself do not pay "pseudo-fees" for your own fields, do you still want to push them on me!" This immediately aroused a burst of applause from the tenants... The two sides argued endlessly. An owner believed that the pseudo-fees could be borne by both parties according to "heavenly principles, national law, and human sentiment." Tenant representative Wang Shugong said: "One shi of rice (6.6 mu) can harvest six shi of wheat every year. Fifteen shi of rice total twenty-one shi. After deducting ten shi of regular rent for you, various labor and fertilizer costs six dan and four dou, and deducting spring repair, dung digging, "meals," "small rent," and "estate watching" for more than three shi, and then paying "pseudo-fees" of four shi, totaling twenty-three shi and four dou, we still have to pay backwards for a year of hard work! It really forces me to be so miserable!! Without food or clothing, I still have to go out to sell my labor and flee famine everywhere!" He recalled the past difficult years, aroused anger, and veins appeared on his face. He said loudly: "What are 'heavenly principles,' 'national law,' and 'human sentiment'!" His words aroused sympathetic applause from the tenants again. However, the tenants are ultimately aware of the big picture and are unwilling to affect the harmony between the landlord and the tenant due to the dispute over the "pseudo-fee" issue. After a period of silence, a tenant surnamed Gao took the lead in making concessions. The "pseudo-fees" are paid according to the amount of benefit of the landlord and tenant. More is paid for more benefits and less for less benefits. As long as the owner knows the suffering we have suffered in the past and no longer layerly exploits us, we can forgive them and make concessions. At this point, the opinions of both sides have gradually approached. County Chief Sun proposed "According to heavenly principles and national law, the pseudo-fees should be borne by the owners, but in order to take care of the landlords' lives, the pseudo-fees can be shared by the landlord and tenant in a ratio of four to six, with the tenant paying four and the landlord paying six, and the specific implementation should be based on the economic situation of the owner." The owners all expressed their agreement, and the tenants shouted slogans: "Support County Chief Sun's opinion!"
    After the "pseudo-fee" issue was resolved, the account settlement was carried out. Tenant representative Wang Shugong proposed: "We have twenty-four tenants in Shitang District, planting 161 mu of land for owner Tang Renqian's family. Since the devils came in the 28th year (1939), until the liberation of Huai'an City last year (1945), we have paid a total of 663 shi and two dou of 'pseudo-fees', 'phantom fields' (the area of the fields rented from the boss is less than the mu, becoming a phantom field with real rent), 'meals' (the person in charge goes to the countryside to collect rent, and must be entertained with wine and meat), 'small rent' (the expenses of the person in charge and servants in the landlord's house), 'rice seed watching fees' (when the person in charge goes to the countryside to watch the rice harvest, the tenants have to give money), 'watching the black estate', etc., totaling 1,281 shi, nine dou, and five sheng." After speaking, he handed the detailed bill to the chairman for review. The chairman took the bill and handed it to Wang Shuren, the steward representative of the Tang family, for review, but Wang Shuren repeatedly said that he didn't know and didn't understand even before looking at the bill. The tenant representatives immediately questioned him, some said: "If you don't understand, how do you collect rent? You'll know if you miss a bundle of rent!" Many people were reasoning and persuading. Finally, Wang Shuren had no choice but to admit, he said: "Only the wheat rent is wrong, the rest of the accounts are correct." Both sides agreed to deduct it, and there are still 1,263 shi, five dou, and five sheng remaining. At this time, the tenants voluntarily made concessions again. A representative surnamed Li said: "Today, all kinds of exploitations are brought up to let the boss know the suffering we have suffered in the past, how we ended up being poor and unable to get ahead. Now we automatically make concessions and only count five accounts: 1. 'Advance wheat borrowing'; 2. 'Pseudo-fees'; 3. 'Car repairs'; 4. (telegraph code unclear); 5. 'Ditch digging and dike building'." As soon as he finished speaking, both the landlord and tenant sides applauded warmly, so owner Tang Renqian immediately settled the accounts according to this standard. The owners saw that the tenants made such concessions and expressed their gratitude.
    The meeting was coming to a close in the evening. County Chief Sun then took the floor and explained that the tenants worked hard for a year and could not even fill their stomachs. Rent reduction is completely in line with "heavenly principles," "national law," and "human sentiment." He also cited many examples of exploitation. At this time, Vice Chairman Liu of the Border Region Government also took the floor. He first explained that today is a unity meeting between owners and tenants. He hoped that people would not listen to rumors spread by bad people in the future. The Communist Party is to ensure that both the rich and the poor have food to eat, everyone has clothes to wear, and everyone has a good life. We advocate reasoning. If you have reason, you can go anywhere in the world, and without reason, you cannot move an inch. Reasoning should be done in a democratic way. The tenants should speak, and the owners should also speak, to clarify the reasoning. Both owners and tenants listened quietly, and his voice was repeatedly drowned out by warm applause. The meeting ended at dusk, and this first-of-its-kind owner-tenant unity meeting in Huai'an City came to a successful conclusion.

　　石塘区的主佃仲裁会议
    新华社淮安通讯
    三月二十日，淮安市石塘区七个街四千群众，进城向地主算账，怒倒石碑后，（见本报五月二十日载——编者）立即返乡，分别集合进行清算，截至月底，一部租佃仲裁问题，已获解决，部分租佃账目，因地主不明大义，对各种额外剥削如预借麦、伪费等，不肯按法清算，群情愤慨，要求政府调处，同时地主也要求政府迅速处理，于是在四月四日，由淮安县府、市府、石塘区署共同主持下召开了主佃仲裁会议，下面即是该会议的通讯，从这里我们可以看出地主剥削佃户的残酷，而佃户却是宽大为怀。
     ——编者
    四月四日这一天给予淮安石塘区人民的印象太深刻了，他们永远不会忘记这样一个场面：在淮安县政府大礼堂内，一边坐着六十余位衣冠楚楚的业主，另一边坐着二百多位穿戴得很粗陋的佃农代表，他们双方都在说明自己的意见，以致争论得面红耳赤。这就是淮安石塘区的减租仲裁会议。
    在会议前曾经过主佃双方的酝酿，政府也作了详尽的调查研究，因此双方代表到得很齐全，下午一时即由淮城尹市长宣布开会，他说：石塘区发动减租算账以后，主佃双方一时难能解决很多问题；政府同时接到业主及佃户双方申请书，请求调解双方纠纷，因此召开这个会议。
    接着主佃双方踊跃发言，业主方面林秀五、赵兰亭、秦士良等，有的叙述此次算账情形，有的询问算账标准，佃户方面，发言者是王树功、他说出佃户苦处，要求清算“看稻费”等十余种额外剥削。主佃相继发言后，即进入仲裁，首先是解决业主汤仞千与佃户的纠纷（汤有一百二十六亩地在教场乡，本人在上海未归，由庄头王树仁为代表）。由佃户代表王树功按照账单叙述各项被剥削的细账。第一项“伪费”即发生争执，业主代表认为乡下有费，街上也有费，因此应由佃户负担，佃户王树功听着不服气，他立即站起来高声说，“伪费”是田亩摊派的，而我们种你地是出了租的，你自己的田不出“伪费”，难道还要朝我身上推！当即激起佃户们的一阵掌声，……双方争持不下，有个业主认为可以根据“天理、国法、人情”把伪费由双方负担，佃户代表王树功说：“一石稻（六亩六分）每年可收六石小麦，十五石稻共二十一石，除去给你们十石正租，各种人工、粪水要六担四斗，又扣去春修挑粪挖圩，“供饭”、‘小租’、‘看庄’等三石多，再要出“伪费”四石，共二十三石四斗，我们一年辛苦还要倒贴，真逼得我好苦啊！！没吃没穿，还要出去卖苦力，到处逃荒”！他想起了过去苦难的岁月，激起了愤怒，脸上泛出条条的筋脉，大声说：“什么是‘天理’，‘国法’，‘人情’呵”！他的话又激起了佃户们同情的掌声。但是佃户们终究是明白大义的，不愿因为“伪费”问题的争执而影响主佃之间的和睦，经过一度沉寂后，一个姓高的佃户，首先表示让步，“伪费”照主佃得益多少来出，得多出多，得少出少，只要主人知道我们过去受的苦，不再层层的剥削我们，我们可原谅他们，可以让步，至此双方意见已渐接近，孙县长就提出“按照天理国法，伪费应由业主负担，但为照顾地主生活，伪费可由主佃双方四六分担，佃四主六，还要依据业主的经济情况，具体执行”。业主都表示同意，佃户并高呼口号：“拥护孙县长的意见”！
    “伪费”问题解决后，即进行算账，佃户代表王树功提出：“我们石塘区有二十四家佃户，种业主汤仞千家地一百六十一亩，自二十八年鬼子来起，到去年解放淮城的七年中，我们共出‘伪费’六百六十三石二斗，‘虚田’（租老板的田不足亩数，成为虚田实租），‘供饭’（管事下乡收租，必须酒肉款待），‘小租’（地主家管事和仆役开支），‘稻种看稻费’（管事下乡看稻收成时，佃户要送钱），‘看黑庄’等，总共出费一千二百八十一石九斗五升。”说罢就把详尽的账单递给主席审查，主席接过账单来，交给汤家庄头代表王树仁查看，但王树仁接过账单还未过目就连声说不知不懂，佃户代表立即群起质问，有的说：“你不懂怎来催租的，少把一捆租，你就知道”？好多人都在说理，都在规劝，最后王树仁终于不得不承认，他说：“只有麦租了，余的账都不错。”双方同意扣除，尚有一千二百六十三石五斗五升，这时佃户又自愿再作让步，一个姓李的代表说：“今天各种剥削都提出来，是要老板知道我们过去受的苦，我们是怎样弄得穷不出头的，现在我们自动让步，只算五笔账，一、‘预借麦’；二、‘伪费’；三、‘修车’；四、（电码不明）五、‘挖沟挖圩’。”刚一说完，主佃双方均热烈鼓掌，于是业主汤仞千立即按此标准结算。业主见佃户如此让步，表示非常感谢。
    会议至此，已近傍晚，仲裁即告结束，孙县长即起讲话，他说明佃户苦活一年，不能一饱，减租是完全合乎“天理”“国法”“人情”的。他又举了很多被剥削的例子。这时边府刘副主席也继起讲话，他首先说明今天是业佃团结会议，他希望以后不要听坏人造谣，共产党是使穷富都有饭吃，大家有衣穿，大家日子过得好，我们提倡讲理，有理走遍天下，无理寸步难行。讲理要采取民主方式，佃户要说业主也要说，把理讲清楚。业佃双方都静静的倾听着，他的话声屡为热烈的掌声所淹没。会至薄暮，这个在淮安城首创的业佃团结会议，就告胜利结束了。
