　　【Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 14th】Recently, Kuomintang (KMT) special agents, in coordination with the KMT army's military offensive, have intensified their sabotage against our liberated area's militia. Their modus operandi is to cooperate with local puppet troops, bandits, and KMT armies to launch surprise attacks on the residences of our militia in border villages, and to conduct disintegration work by combining feudal organizations and adopting means of threats, enticements, and rumors. Special agents in the border areas of the Fourth Military Sub-district, in coordination with Ding Shuben, Wang Sanzhu, and other puppet troops from Dongming, Changyuan, and Fengqiu in the border areas, frequently attacked our militia residences in border villages with 300 to 500 people. On April 11th, the KMT’s 68th Army from Changyuan, in coordination with local bandits, surrounded the militia of Bin Village, Seventh District, Hua County, and captured eleven militiamen from the village. Similar incidents have occurred in Gaoling and Neihuang. According to incomplete statistics from the Fourth Military Sub-district, since the ceasefire order, 162 militiamen in the sub-district have been captured or killed, and more than 150 guns have been lost. The militia captain of Mengzhuang, Changyuan, was dragged outside the village by armed special agents and threatened, being given two days to bring the villagers' militia into Dongming City, otherwise, "the whole family would be exterminated." In the Seventh District of Qi County, the method of "buying insurance" from secret societies was used to deceive the militia. In Weinan, rumors were fabricated that "the Eighth Route Army is pulling the militia to the Northeast," calling on the militia to hand in their guns. Now, the militia in our border areas have raised their vigilance, organized joint defense, and strictly guarded against the sabotage of special agents.

　　冀鲁豫边沿区民兵组织联防
    打击国特土匪袭扰
    【新华社荷泽十四日电】国民党特务分子近来配合国民党军队的军事进攻，加紧其对我解放区民兵的破坏。其活动方式为配合当地伪军、土匪及国民党军队，向我民兵突袭，与结合封建组织，采取威胁、利诱、造谣手段，进行瓦解工作。四分区边沿区之特务分子，配合边沿区东明、长垣、封邱之丁树本、王三祝及其他伪军，经常以三五百人袭击我边沿村庄民兵住地。四月十一日，长坌元国民党六十八军，配合当地土匪包围我滑县七区缤村民兵，捕去该村民兵十一人。高陵、内黄已均发生同样事件。据四分区不完全的统计：自停战命令以来，该分区民兵被捕杀一百六十二人，损失枪一百五十余枝。长垣孟庄民兵队长被武装特务拉到村外威胁，限两日将该村民兵拉进东明城，否则“剿灭全家”。在淇县七区，则利用会门“买保”的办法欺骗民兵。卫南则制造“八路军拉民兵去东北”的谣言，叫民兵缴枪。现在我边沿区民兵均已提高警惕，组织联防，严防特务分子的破坏。
