　　Liu Maoen Plots to Eliminate the Yüdong Liberated Area
    Conspiracy Exposed in Plan
    Orders Stipulate: Numbers Use Code Names, Military Uniforms Exchanged for Plain Clothes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 15th] This reporter today obtained a copy of the Kuomintang's plan to launch a large-scale attack on our Yüdong Liberated Area. The plan was "in accordance with Director Liu Maoen's Youji telegram order," attempting to "thoroughly eliminate" our Yüdong Liberated Area troops. "Special care must be taken to prevent bandits from fleeing northwest and southeast." The order stipulates that "all suppression troops must change into plain clothes." Regarding identification marks, the plan states: Our (the Kuomintang referring to themselves) suppression troops should use towels or other items to wrap around their necks on the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th of each month; tie them on their left arms on the 2nd, 5th, and 8th; and tie them on their right arms on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th. Regardless of suppression, defense, or mobile units, they should not wear armbands or symbols, as well as numbers or names. Even if there are papers with numbers or names, they should all use code names or aliases when issuing orders and communicating." The plan stipulates that Tian Zhenzhou be changed to "Shou Ce," and the code word be "Ji." The plan stipulates that the troops participating in the attack on our Yüdong Liberated Area include Mi Wenhe's 181st Division, Ge Kaixiang's 81st Division with five battalions, six provincial and special district security regiments, two regiments of the Fourth Detachment, and security teams from fifteen counties. The plan's supplementary note also stipulates that "each county and district should raise one month's worth of supplies on its own."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 15th] Following the talks between the two chiefs of staff in Xinxiang, and Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters Chief of Staff Zhao Zili's unreasonable denial of the existence of our Yüdong Liberated Area, the Kuomintang again submitted a memorandum to the Xinxiang group on May 8th, still denying the fact that our Eighth Route Army existed in Yüdong before January 14th. This reporter visited the authorities of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region on this matter. The military region authorities presented the original letter from the 119th Division of the 68th Army to our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Yüdong Military Sub-district Commander Jin Keqin on January 14th. The letter roughly stated: "I have long admired your military prowess and deeply regret not having had the opportunity to meet you! Our two sides are temporarily hostile. Now, our government and your representatives have agreed on measures to cease conflict and have promulgated the following orders (omitted). Our side has now implemented the above orders. We hope that your side will send personnel to contact us to avoid misunderstandings," and so on. This letter was sent by the Kuomintang military high command to our Eighth Route Army in Yüdong the day after the ceasefire order took effect on January 13th. Our army immediately sent a staff officer to make contact after receiving the letter. The factual evidence is all there. Whether or not there was an Eighth Route Army in the Yüdong area before January 14th is clear at a glance. Now, the Kuomintang army repeatedly denies our Yüdong Liberated Area, and then secretly arranges the encirclement and suppression by more than 30,000 people. Its purpose is clearly to launch a civil war and create large-scale bloodshed. The military region authorities believe that the situation is extremely serious. If unfortunate events occur, the Kuomintang should bear full responsibility. They also stated: The military region has taken a photo of the letter and plans to send it to the Beiping Executive Headquarters and relevant agencies.

　　刘茂恩妄图消灭豫东解放区
    计划书中阴谋毕露
    命令规定：番号用代号军衣换便衣
    【新华社邯郸十五日电】记者今日获得国民党大举进攻我豫东解放区的计划一份，该计划系“遵照刘主任茂恩酉计电令”，企图“彻底肃清”我豫东解放区部队。“尤须严防匪向西北东南逃窜”。该命令中规定“进剿部队一律换便衣”，对于识别记号，该计划称：我（国民党自称）进剿部队应于一、四、七、十各日用毛巾或其他用品，围在颈上；二、五、八日绑在左臂；三、六、九日绑在右臂，无论进剿，防剿，及机动部队均不带臂章符号以及番号、姓名，即有番号，姓名之纸张，下命令及通讯时，一律用代号、讹名”。计划中规定田镇州讹为“守策”，代字为“计”。计划中规定参加进攻我豫东解放区的部队有一八一师米文和部与八十一师葛开祥部五个营，省与专区保安团六个，第四分队两个团，十五个县保安团队。该计划补记中并规定“各县区应自筹一个月给养”。
    【新华社邯郸十五日电】继新乡两参谋长会谈，郑州绥署参谋长赵子立无理否认我豫东解放区存在后，国民党于五月八日又向新乡小组提出备忘录，仍然否认元月十四日前豫东有我八路军存在的事实。记者以此往访晋冀鲁豫军区当局，军区当局当以六十八军一一九师元月十四日致我晋冀鲁豫豫东军分区金克勤司令员的原函出示，该函略称：“久仰戎仪，深以未得识荆为怅！我双方敌对一时，现我政府与贵方代表对于停止冲突业经商定办法，公布下开命令（略），现我方已遵上项命令实施，贵方有何意见，敬希派员连络，免生误会”等语。这一函件是元月十三日停战命令生效后的次日，由国民党军高级司令部送交豫东我八路军的。我军接函后当即派参谋前往连络，事实证据俱在，元月十四日前豫东区有无八路军即可一目了然。今国民党军一再否认我豫东解放区，接着秘密布置三万余人的围剿，其目的显在发动内战，制造大规模的流血事件。军区当局认为事态已极严重，如果发生不幸事件，应由国民党负其全责。并称：军区已将该函摄成照片，准备送交北平执行部与各有关机关。
