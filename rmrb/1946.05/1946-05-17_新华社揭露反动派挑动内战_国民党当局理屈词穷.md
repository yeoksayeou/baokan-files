　　Xinhua News Agency Exposes Reactionaries Provoking Civil War
    Kuomintang Authorities Speechless and Defeated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Xinhua News Agency's dispatch from Yan'an on the 7th, exposing the fact that Kuomintang reactionaries are mobilizing over a million troops to continue the civil war, has drawn serious attention from all parties. To this end, the Army Headquarters, headed by He Yingqin, had no choice but to have its spokesperson issue a "rebuttal" (see the Central News Agency's dispatch of the 11th). However, pitifully, the spokesperson could not produce any evidence to support this "rebuttal." Apart from a vague defense regarding the 73rd Army's secret transport to Jinan, they avoided answering the facts of the mobilization of more than a dozen other armies and ninety-odd divisions (with numbers, times, and locations). This further proves the accuracy and reliability of Xinhua News Agency's dispatch, which cannot be "rebutted."

　　新华社揭露反动派挑动内战
    国民党当局理屈词穷
    【新华社延安十三日电】新华社延安七日电讯揭露国民党反动派，为了继续内战而调动百万以上军队的事实，已引起各方的严重注意。为此，以何应钦为首之陆军总部，乃不得不由其发言人进行“驳斥”（见中央社十一日电），但是可怜得很，该发言人拿不出一点证据来支持这种“驳斥”，除了对于七十三军密运济南一事略有空洞的申辩外，对于其他之十几个军、九十几个师的调动事实（有番号有时间有地点），都避而不答，这更证明新华社电讯的确实可靠，它是无法可以“驳斥”的。
