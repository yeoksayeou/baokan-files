　　US President's Loan Policy
    Winning Political Influence with Money
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th dispatch] Shanghai Airlines News: According to a United Press dispatch on the 12th, President Truman is planning to exchange US dollars for American political objectives. The United States originally planned to lend Poland 90 million US dollars, but it has now been stopped, reportedly because it requires the Polish government to see "whether it intends to implement the 'political freedom' that is allowed." At the same time, US Treasury Secretary Vinson and French representative Blum are negotiating with the Export-Import Bank, and are expected to decide to release 650 million US dollars this week, plus war materials and other loans totaling 2.2 billion US dollars. However, the timing of this loan disbursement will maximize its impact on the French general election in June. Officials do not deny that the United States is doing this in an attempt to use the announcement of this loan to enhance the position of French Foreign Minister Bidault's Popular Republican Movement and Blum's Socialist Party in the general election, in order to counter the Communist Party. As far as China is concerned, the 500 million US dollar loan also has its direct political effect. This loan has already been prepared by the Export-Import Bank, ready to be paid out, but it is now suspended, because it is said that Truman has given special envoy Marshall the power of veto, so that the special envoy can "act expediently" in China.

　　美总统贷款方针
    以金元赢得政治作用
    【新华社延安二十四日电】上海航讯：据联合社十二日电称：杜鲁门总统正拟以美元换取美国政治目的。美国原拟借给波兰九千万美元，但现已告停止。据说是要求波兰政府“是否有意实行所允许的‘政治自由’”。同时美财长文森及法国代表勃鲁姆，正在与进出口银行谈判，可望于本周内决定放出六亿五千万美元，加上战争物资及其他贷款共达二十二亿美元。但此项借款发放时间，当使其对法国六月间大选，发生最大作用。官场方面并不否认美国这样做，是企图借此借款之宣布，增强法外长比道尔之人民共和运动，及勃鲁姆之社会党在大选举中之地位，以与共产党相对抗。至于就中国而论，五亿美元借款亦有其直接政治作用。此项借款，本已由进出口银行备款，以待准备付出，现在却暂停未放，因为据说杜鲁门赋予马歇尔特使以否决权，以便特使在华“便宜行事”。
