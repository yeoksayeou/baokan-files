　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】 Moscow Radio: Masinu published a commentary on the China issue, stating that the New York Times correspondent Gailky's Beijing dispatch on the 5th revealed the truth about Yan Xishan's collaboration with the Japanese army in China. He said: When Yan Xishan addressed Japanese officers in Taiyuan on March 10th, he expressed satisfaction with the achievements of Okamura Neji, the commander of the Japanese army in North China. Now Okamura is being treated very well in Nanjing, and Yan has declared to the officers of Okamura's staff that Japan did not suffer defeat in the war, especially in the war against China. Yan Xishan thanked the Japanese army for helping him. According to American news, Japanese officers live in beautiful buildings in Taiyuan, strutting around like victors. Japanese officers often fly freely between Beijing and Taiyuan. According to the investigation by the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation, Yan has preserved the Japanese army's own armed forces and sent them to the garrison areas close to the CCP army. Gailky personally saw many documents proving that a large number of Japanese troops are still in Shanxi, fighting under the command of Yan Xishan. Gailky stated: It is not the first time that Yan's collaboration with the Japanese army has been revealed in American publications. On February 12th, the New York Times published an interview by its correspondent Liebermann with Yan Xishan and Haraizumi Kaoru, the commander of the Japanese army in Shanxi. Haraizumi stated: Since the Japanese surrender, his army has not laid down its weapons. Until now, only 2,000 Japanese soldiers have been repatriated, while the remaining 42,000 Japanese troops continue to live in 292 mansions in Shanxi. Yan openly told Japanese officers that he must keep the Japanese army in Shanxi because he opposes the CCP. According to Liebermann, Japanese generals live in Yan Xishan's mansions and are his "honored guests."
    Recently, members of the Chongqing Shanxi Guild Hall pointed out at a press conference that Yan has not yet disarmed the Japanese army, nor has he held a Japanese surrender ceremony. He has neither repatriated the Japanese army nor disbanded the puppet army. Instead, he has reorganized the Japanese and puppet troops into armed forces to oppose the people. The oppression suffered by the residents of Shanxi is even worse than before the Japanese surrender. These actions of Yan are not surprising, because Yan has always been an extremely reactionary traitor who colluded closely with the Japanese invaders. Japanese imperialism has long used him to realize its plan to occupy North China. From 1929 to 1930, Yan, on the orders of Japan, led the Northern Alliance against the National Government. The Japanese greatly assisted this military operation, attempting to provoke a Chinese civil war. After the Northern Alliance failed militarily, Yan ran to Dalian and lived comfortably under Japanese protection. Later, he flew back to Taiyuan. When Japan invaded North China, they placed their most loyal lackey, Yan Xishan, in such an important strategic place as Shanxi. Yan tried his best to help Japan occupy North China. He turned Taiyuan into a base camp for Japanese spies and a nest of Chinese traitors. Japan implemented provocative tricks to occupy North China from here, slaughtering and persecuting anti-Japanese elements and patriotic people. When Wang Jingwei organized a puppet government in Nanjing, Yan immediately established close contact with the traitor Wang, while he himself still wore a patriotic mask. Japan knew when to use his loyal lackey. After the Japanese surrender, they used Yan to preserve their bases and a large number of armed forces in North China. Therefore, Japan still has the possibility of realizing its ruling task in China—undermining the unity of the Chinese people and provoking a Chinese civil war.
    It is not surprising that Yan is working hard to implement Japan's plan, but what is strange is that the United States is also assisting this conspiracy. New York Times correspondent Gailky pointed out: Not long ago, at a meeting held by the Japanese liaison officer and the US military representative at the Japanese Army Staff Headquarters in Beijing, the Japanese officer reported the situation of the Japanese army fighting against the CCP army under the command of Yan Xishan. Gailky also pointed out that the meeting was conducted in a harmonious atmosphere. The United States has been trying to delay the repatriation of the Japanese army and praised the battle situation around Taiyuan. After the meeting, an American officer said: These Japanese officers should consult with them as consistently as their own allies.
    Anyone who is concerned about China's political life will ask: Are the actions of the US military representatives in Beijing in line with the decisions of the Moscow Conference of the Three Powers regarding China? As everyone knows, the resolutions of the Moscow Conference of the Three Powers regarding China are about China's unification and democratization, cessation of the civil war, reaching an agreement, and faithfully adhering to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs.

### 苏评论家马西努著论  痛斥阎锡山勾结日寇  美军帮助日阎进攻解放区，不符莫斯科二国决议

　　苏评论家马西努著论
    痛斥阎锡山勾结日寇
    美军帮助日阎进攻解放区，不符莫斯科二国决议
    【新华社延安十二日电】莫斯科广播：马西努对中国问题发表评论称：美纽约时报访员盖尔基五日北平电讯，揭露了阎锡山勾结在华日军之真象。他说：阎锡山三月十日在太原对日本军官致词时，表示满意华北日军司令冈村宁次的功绩。现在冈村在南京很受优待，阎氏曾向冈村参谋部的军官声明，日本在战争中，尤其是在对华战争中，并未遭受失败。阎锡山感谢日军为他帮忙。据美国消息指出７日本军官在太原住着漂亮的楼房，象胜利者一样，趾高气扬。日本军官经常乘飞机自由来往北平、太原之间。据军调执行部查明，阎氏保存着日军自己的武装，并将其派赴接近中共军的驻区去。盖尔基亲眼见到许多文件，证明日本大批部队仍继续在山西，由阎锡山指挥作战。盖尔基称：在美国刊物上揭露阎氏勾结日军已不止一次，二月十二日的纽约时报就已登载该报访员里伯尔曼的阎氏与山西日军司令原泉馨的谈话，原泉称：从日本投降日起，他的军队就未放下武器，直到现在，遣送回国的日军兵士仅二千人，而其余四万二千日军部队，继续住在山西二百九十二个公馆里。阎氏公开告诉日本军官说：他因为反对中共，所以必须把日军留在山西。据里伯尔曼说：日本将军住在阎锡山的公馆里，并为阎氏的“上宾”。
    最近重庆山西会馆人员在记者招待会上，曾指出阎氏直到现在，并未解除日军武装，亦未举行日本投降典礼，既没有遣送日军返国，亦没有解散伪军，反而将日伪军队编成反对人民的武装部队。山西居民所受压迫较日本投降前变本加厉。阎氏的这些行动，是不足为奇的，因为阎氏一向就是极端反动的、与日寇密切勾结的卖国贼，日本帝国主义早就利用他实现其侵占华北的计划。一九二九年至三○年，阎氏奉日本之命，领导反对国民政府的北方同盟，日本人曾大大援助这一军事行动，他们企图挑起中国内战。北方同盟在军事上失败之后，阎氏即跑到大连，在日本保护下，逍遥自在，后他又飞回太原。当日本侵略华北时，他们又把自己最忠实的走狗——阎锡山，安置在山西这样重要的战略地方。阎氏竭力帮助日本侵占华北，他曾将太原变成日本奸细的大本营、中国卖国贼的巢穴。日本从这里实施侵占华北的挑拨诡计，屠杀迫害抗日分子与爱国志士。当汪精卫在南京组织傀儡政府时，阎氏马上与汪逆建立密切联系，而他自己仍戴着爱国的假面具。日本深知在什么时机利用他的忠实走狗，在日本投降以后，便利用阎氏保存了自己在华北的根据地及大量武装力量，因此日本还有可能实现在中国的统治任务——破坏中国人民的统一，挑起中国的内战。
    阎氏努力实行日本的计划本不足为奇，而奇怪的是美国也在援助这一勾当。纽约时报访员盖尔基指出：不久前，日军联络官与美军代表在日军北平参谋部举行的会议上，日军官，告日本在阎锡山指挥下向中共军作战的情形。盖尔基并指出，这次会议是在和睦气氛下进行的，美国竭立延缓遣送日军回国，并赞扬太原一带的战况。会议后，一个美国军官说道：这些日本军官应该像自己的盟军一样与他们协商一致。
    凡是关切中国政治生活的人，都会发问：美军代表在北平的行动，是与三强莫斯科会议关于中国的决议相符合吗？大家知道，三强莫斯科会议关于中国的决议，是关于中国统一与民主化，停止内战，达到协定，以及忠实于不干涉中国内政的政策。
