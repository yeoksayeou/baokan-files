    Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant's Process Analysis Work
    Integrated

    Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant is an old factory. Before 1954, there were no technological regulations. In 1954 and 1955, some technological regulations were formulated, but due to insufficient experience and technical level in process work, the compilation time was rushed. Generally, the old processing methods were still used. In the past year, there was a lack of systematic sorting and modification, and the advanced nature of the technological regulations was still insufficient, restricting the exertion of workshop productivity. In the production process, the workers and masses often put forward many rationalization proposals and created many advanced operating methods, but they have not yet been comprehensively analyzed and incorporated into the technological regulations.

    At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, based on the high enthusiasm of workers for production, the factory, according to instructions from higher authorities, conducted comprehensive planning, formulated a two-year technical transformation plan, and began to adjust the production line. At the same time, some opinions and measures were put forward for improving the process and tapping potential, but they were not comprehensive and systematic, resulting in certain indicators set in the overall plan being either too conservative or lacking specific methods of implementation. In mid-February of this year, the factory leadership, based on the experience of technician Zhao Zhiqing of the Technology Section in analyzing the problems discovered in the small-batch trial production of power capacitors, combined with Soviet technological data, workshop process conditions, and rationalization proposals from workers, proposed measures to improve the process. They convened a meeting of staff and technical personnel from the three main production workshops of transformers, rotating motors, and steam turbines to deploy process analysis work. After the meeting, groups were formed with process personnel from the Technology Section and workshop quota setters, inspectors, and technical section chiefs as the core, and based on Soviet drawings and process cards, combined with the advanced experience of other factories and the rationalization proposals and advanced experience of our factory's workers, analyzed the existing process, processing methods, workshop production routes, labor organization, material, and equipment utilization on a piece-by-piece (part), sequence-by-sequence (operation) basis, thereby proposing improvement measures. These three workshops proposed a total of 392 improvement projects, including 29 items of advanced experience from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, 40 items of advanced experience and rationalization proposals from our factory, 151 improvement suggestions from workshops, sections, the factory leadership, and workers, and 155 improvement suggestions from process personnel of the Technology Section.

    After these process improvement projects were comprehensively sorted out, they were combined with the discussion of the national plan and organized for workers to discuss. The entire factory proposed a total of 609 major process improvement measures. These included 155 items belonging to improving processing methods, 57 items reducing processes, 161 items improving tools, 62 items improving the manufacturability of designs, and 23 items improving equipment. Among these improvement projects, some are definitely feasible, while others require experimental research; some require the design and manufacture of tools, while others can be implemented simply by modifying the process documents; some are simple and easy to implement, while others are more complex and involve a wider range of aspects; some solve the main problems in current production, while others have a smaller impact. According to preliminary estimates, if all are implemented, 294,000 man-hours can be saved (including a portion of outsourced parts).

    Process analysis is a good method for rectifying old products and improving the advanced nature of processes. It creates conditions for the comprehensive technical transformation of enterprises. From the practice of this factory, it has shown these advantages:

      (1) It improves the advanced nature of the process. For example, in the steam turbine generator workshop, after process analysis, the output can be increased by nearly double the amount specified in the technical design. The output of the transformer workshop also exceeds the technical design requirements and is more than double the amount of last year.

      (2) Through process analysis, the backwardness of past processes was discovered, thereby educating the workers. Through process analysis, the workers' understanding of learning from Soviet advanced experience was further enhanced, and the factory's scattered rationalization proposals and advanced operating methods can also be incorporated into the technological regulations, and organizational systems can be used to ensure their implementation (282 rationalization proposals and advanced experiences from workers were absorbed in these 609 process improvement measures). Conversely, it can also stimulate the workers' enthusiasm for making rationalization proposals and promoting advanced experience, and it provides topics and directions for rationalization proposals.

      (3) Through process analysis, the past tendency of process personnel to close themselves off and compile cards, not go to the workshop, not consult with workers, and even look down on workers' suggestions has been overcome. Now, many engineering and technical personnel actively go deep into the workshop and actively study problems with the workers. This can also help workers improve their technical knowledge and strengthen the ties between departments and workshops.

      (4) Through comprehensive and systematic process analysis, conditions are provided for systematic technical transformation. Process analysis is a component part of the comprehensive technical transformation of existing enterprises, or it is the entry stage, which is also helpful to improving enterprise management.

    Because Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant is doing this work for the first time, there are still relatively serious shortcomings. That is, it focuses too much on quantity and speed and not enough on quality and saving. Among the process improvement projects that have been proposed, those belonging to quantity and speed account for 74.5%, those belonging to quality account for 22%, and those belonging to saving only account for 3.5%. Many historical quality problems of this factory have not been touched upon. This year, it is necessary to reduce costs by 21.5%, but there are still no specific measures. The process analysis work is not sufficiently combined with the current production problems, and the effect of certain process analyses that can be immediately implemented has not been reflected in the improvement of various indicators in a timely manner. In addition, because organizational work and ideological work have not been carried out sufficiently, during the course of the work, it was almost limited to the participation of Technology Section personnel, and the relevant departments and relevant technical personnel were not fully mobilized to participate and cooperate, resulting in many disconnections and imbalances; different views have also been generated among some staff members regarding the significance and role of this work. The leadership of this factory has already discovered these shortcomings, some of which have been resolved, and some of which are being resolved.

    上海电机厂的工艺分析工作  
    集成
    上海电机厂是个老厂。1954年以前没有工艺规程。1954年和1955年制定了一些工艺规程，但是由于工艺工作的经验和技术水平不够，编制时间仓促，一般仍沿用老的加工方法，一年来又缺乏系统的整理和修改，工艺规程的先进性仍然不足，束缚着车间生产力的发挥。在生产过程中，职工群众经常提出许多合理化建议和创造不少先进操作方法，但是，还没有把它们综合分析，纳入工艺规程中去。
    去年年底和今年年初，这个厂在职工生产热情高涨的基础上，根据上级指示，进行全面规划，制定了两年技术改造方案，并且着手调整生产线。同时，对改进工艺发挥潜力方面也提出了一些意见和措施，但是不全面、不系统，致使全面规划中所订某些指标，不是偏于保守，就是缺乏实现的具体办法。今年二月中旬，厂部根据工艺科技术员赵志清结合电力电容器小批试制中发现的问题，综合苏联工艺资料、车间工艺情况和职工合理化建议加以分析，提出改进工艺的措施的经验，召开了变压器、旋转电机、汽轮机三个主要生产车间的工作人员和技术人员会议，部署了工艺分析工作。会后，以工艺科工艺人员和车间定额员、检查员、技术工段长等共同组成小组，以车间为单位，根据苏联图纸和工艺过程卡片，结合外厂的先进经验和本厂职工的合理化建议和先进经验，逐件（零件）、逐序（工序）地分析现有工艺过程、加工方法、车间生产路线、劳动组织、材料和设备利用情况，从而提出改进措施。这三个车间，共提出改进项目392件，其中包括苏联和捷克斯洛伐克先进经验29件，本厂先进经验和合理化建议40件，车间、工段、厂部和工人提出的改进意见151件，工艺科工艺人员提出的改进意见155件。
    这些改进工艺项目经综合整理后，结合讨论国家计划，组织工人讨论。全厂共提出改进工艺的主要措施609件。其中包括属于改进加工方法的155项，减少工序的57项，改进工具的161项，提高设计的工艺性的62项，改进设备的23项。在这些改进项目中，有肯定可行的，也有要试验研究的；有需要设计制造工具的，也有只修改一下工艺文件即可实现的；有简单易行的，也有较复杂而牵涉面较广的；有解决当前生产中的主要问题的，也有影响较小的。据初步估算，如全部实现，可节约二十九万四千工时（包括一部分外包零件）。
    工艺分析是整顿老产品、提高工艺先进性的好方法。它为企业的全面技术改造创造了条件。从这个厂实践过程中，它已经表现出这些优点：
      （一）提高了工艺的先进性。如汽轮发电机车间，经过工艺分析后，产量可比技术设计规定的增加将近一倍，变压器车间产量也超过技术设计规定的，并且比去年的增加一倍多。
      （二）通过工艺分析，发现了过去工艺的落后，从而教育了职工。通过工艺分析，进一步提高了职工对学习苏联先进经验的认识，还可以把本厂零星的合理化建议和先进操作方法纳入工艺规程，用组织制度保证推行（这次609件改进工艺措施中即吸收职工合理化建议和先进经验282条）。反过来，又可以激发职工提合理化建议和推广先进经验的热情，并且给合理化建议提出了课题和方向。
      （三）通过工艺分析，克服了工艺人员过去关门编卡片、不下车间，不同工人商量，甚至看不起工人的建议的偏向。现在许多工程技术人员主动深入车间，主动同工人一起研究问题。这也可以帮助工人提高技术知识，密切科室同车间的联系。
      （四）通过全面、综合的工艺分析，给系统的技术改造提供了条件。工艺分析是现有企业进行全面技术改造的一个组成部分，或者是入手阶段，对改进企业管理工作也有帮助。
    上海电机厂因为是初次做这个工作，还有比较严重的缺点。这就是着重多、快，对好、省重视不够。在已经提出的工艺改进项目中，属于多和快的占74.5％，属于质量的占22％，而属于省的只有3.5％。这个厂许多历史性的质量问题没有接触到。今年要降低成本21.5％，但是至今还没有具体措施。工艺分析工作和当前的生产问题结合不够，还没有把某些可以立即实现的工艺分析的效果及时反映到各项指标的提高上去。此外，由于组织工作和思想工作进行得不够充分，致使在工作进行过程中，几乎只限于工艺科人员参加，而未能充分发动各有关科室及有关技术人员参加和配合，因而产生了不少脱节和不平衡现象；对这一工作的意义和作用，在一部分工作人员中也曾产生了不同的看法。这些缺点，这个厂的领导方面业已发现，有些已经解决，有些正在解决中。
