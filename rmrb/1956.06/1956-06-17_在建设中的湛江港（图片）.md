Zhanjiang Port Under Construction

On the east side of the Leizhou Peninsula, the large-scale Zhanjiang Port is currently under construction. This port project is designed by our country itself with the help of Soviet experts. The port construction started in 1955, and the deep-water wharf section has been basically completed. Ten-thousand-ton ships can directly berth and unload goods. After the port is completed, it will become a large commercial port in southern China.

Most of the port construction is done using mechanical construction. Concrete beams for warehouses, etc., are prefabricated and then installed with cranes, which greatly shortens the construction period and reduces the physical labor of workers.

In order to strive for the early completion of the port construction project, the construction personnel widely carried out activities of learning technology and exchanging experience. The picture shows workers visiting the construction model of the warehouse base pillar.

The picture shows Li Yage (second from the left), a first-class advanced producer and engineer from a worker background, and the engineering staff on the "Changjiang" dredging vessel, studying the problem of replacing bridge rollers.

    在建设中的湛江港
    在雷州半岛的东侧，目前正在建设一个规模宏大的湛江港。这个港的工程是在苏联专家帮助下，由我国自己设计的。建港工程从1955年开始，现在深水码头部分已经基本完成，万吨的轮船可以直接靠岸卸货。该港建成以后，将成为我国南方的一个大商港。

    建港工程大部分都是使用机械施工。仓库的混凝土梁等都是预先制好，再用起重机安装上去的，因而大大地缩短了工期，减轻了工人的体力劳动。
