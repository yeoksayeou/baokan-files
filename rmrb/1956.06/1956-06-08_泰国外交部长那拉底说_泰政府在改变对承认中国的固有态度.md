Xinhua News Agency, 7th, dispatch from Bangkok: Thai Foreign Minister Naradhip told reporters on the morning of May 31 regarding Sino-Thai relations that the government of the People's Republic of China is now a government that truly has the power and is sufficient to control the entire Chinese mainland. He said that this has become a fact that no one can deny.

Naradhip made these remarks in public response to recent strong opinions in Thai public opinion demanding that the Thai government quickly establish trade and diplomatic relations with China. He believes that the current international situation is increasingly favorable for China's formal entry into the United Nations, and China's qualifications for entering the United Nations are no longer a problem, only a matter of time.

He said that the Thai government, based on the current changes in the international situation, has begun to change its inherent attitude toward recognizing China, and will immediately grant recognition once China enters the United Nations. He said that Thailand does not yet recognize China because it cannot recognize "two Chinese governments" at the same time.

Naradhip said that although Thailand has recognized the Taiwan government, this does not mean that the Thai government's foreign policy will remain unchanged forever. On the contrary, the Thai government's foreign policy must change according to changes in the international situation. He explained that Thailand has its own policy on the issue of recognizing China, and is not directed by the United States.

On the same morning, Naradhip also revealed to reporters on the issue of direct trade between China and Thailand that the "plan" for direct trade with China, jointly studied by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been drafted and will be submitted to the cabinet for study recently. He said that the "plan" specifically states that it is not illegal for Thai merchants to establish direct trade relations with China. Thai businessmen can go to mainland China for business purposes. He believes that after the start of normal trade, the exchanges between the merchants of both sides will be normal and necessary.

As for the issue of exchanging trade delegations with China, Naradhip said that this practice has strong political factors, because it has become a stepping stone for recognizing China. At present, Thailand does not intend to take active steps to establish diplomatic relations with China, and therefore does not intend to exchange commercial commissioners with China.

    泰国外交部长那拉底说
    泰政府在改变对承认中国的固有态度
    新华社7日讯　曼谷迟到消息：泰国外交部长那拉底在五月三十一日早上就中泰关系向报界发表谈话说，目前中华人民共和国政府已经是一个真正有权力并且足以控制整个中国大陆的政府。他说，这已经成为一个谁都不能否认的事实了。
    那拉底是在公开答复最近泰国舆论强烈要求泰国政府迅速同中国建立贸易关系和外交关系的时候说这番话的。他认为目前国际形势对中国正式进入联合国越来越有利，中国进入联合国的资格现在已经不成问题，仅是时间问题而已。
    他说，泰国政府根据目前国际形势的转变，已经开始在改变对承认中国的固有态度，一旦中国进入联合国，泰国政府就将立即给予承认。他说，泰国目前还不承认中国是因为在同一期间不能承认“两个中国政府”。
    那拉底说，泰国虽然已经承认台湾政府，但是这并不是表示泰国政府的对外政策将如此永恒不变，相反的，泰国政府的对外政策必须根据国际情势的变化而变化。他说明，泰国对承认中国问题有着泰国自己的政策，并非由美国来指使。
    那拉底在同一天上午还就中泰两国之间直接贸易问题向报界透露，由财政部、经济部和外交部联合共同研究的同中国直接贸易的“计划书”已经拟好，并且将在最近提交内阁研究。他说，“计划书”中特别说明泰国境内商人同中国建立直接贸易关系并不算犯法。泰国商人可以为了商务到中国大陆去。他认为展开正常贸易以后，双方商人的来往将是平常和必要的。
    至于同中国互派贸易代表团问题，那拉底说，这种作法有着浓厚政治因素，因为那已成为承认中国的一块跳板，目前泰国不拟采取积极步骤同中国建立邦交，因此也不拟同中国交换商业专员。
