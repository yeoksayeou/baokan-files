Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd - Japanese war criminal Aikawa Keiji, sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, said that the lenient sentence given to him by the Chinese government was "beyond his wildest dreams." He said this to a Xinhua News Agency reporter after his trial by the Special Military Tribunal in Taiyuan.

All seventeen Japanese war criminals with serious crimes, after being tried in Shenyang and Taiyuan, unanimously expressed their determination to reform themselves diligently during their imprisonment and strive for early release.

Japanese war criminal Suzuki Keikyu said to reporters after the court pronounced the sentence: "I was originally a senior officer (Lieutenant General) of the Japanese Army and committed serious crimes violating humanitarian principles and international law, and I should have received the most severe punishment from the Chinese people. However, the court only sentenced me to twenty years imprisonment, and I am extremely grateful for this lenient treatment." He also said: "The court also credited the number of days we were detained before the verdict as one day of imprisonment for each day, which is something I did not expect. I believe this leniency is based on China's consistent policy of peace."

Uno Shintaro, former lieutenant prisoner-of-war supervision officer and intelligence propaganda director of the 232nd Regiment Headquarters of the 39th Division of the former Japanese Army, requested the reporter to convey his words to his mother in Tokyo. Uno Shintaro, who is only thirty-six years old this year, said to the reporter: "The Chinese court sentenced me to thirteen years of imprisonment, and the date is calculated from August 20, 1945. I feel that I have a bright future."

Sakakibara Hideo, who was sentenced to thirteen years in prison for manufacturing bacteriological weapons, hopes that the reporter will convey the following words to his four children in Japan: "Your father will certainly not disappoint the lenient treatment of the Chinese people and will strive to become a true human being. The path your father took in the past was completely wrong. I hope you will help your mother well, study hard, and become useful people for opposing war and for peace. Your father expects you from the bottom of his heart."

Aikawa Keiji, who was sentenced to fifteen years in prison in Taiyuan, participated in the war of aggression against China in 1937 and killed many peaceful residents and captured anti-Japanese soldiers. After Japan surrendered, he actively helped the Yan Xishan bandit gang in the counter-revolutionary war. After the court's verdict, he said with emotion: "Any one of my crimes is enough to be sentenced to death, but the Chinese people still give me the opportunity to be a human being again." He said: "I must work hard to reform myself during my future sentence and make myself a truly conscientious person."

After hearing that he was sentenced to thirteen years in prison, Nagatomi Hiroshi said with emotion: "This is a leniency I did not expect." He originally imagined it would be "much heavier" than the current sentence. He said that he had "no other thoughts" other than serving his sentence well. Nagatomi Hiroshi finally said: "When our family members hear that we have received such lenient sentences, they will also sincerely thank the Chinese people."

    被判刑的日本战争犯罪分子铃木启久等
    表示要努力改造自己重新做人
    据新华社22日讯　被判处十五年徒刑的日本战争犯罪分子相乐圭二说，中国政府对他的宽大判处是他“梦想不到的”。这是他在太原受到特别军事法庭审判后对新华社记者说的。
    十七名罪行严重的日本战争犯罪分子在沈阳和太原两地受审判以后，一致表示要在今后服刑期间努力改造自己，争取提前释放。
    日本战争犯罪分子铃木启久在法庭宣判以后对记者说：“我原是日本陆军的一个高级军官（中将），犯了违反人道原则和国际法准则的严重罪行，应该受到中国人民最严厉的惩罚。但是，法庭只判我二十年徒刑，这种宽大的处理使我太感激了。”他还说：“法庭还把我们在判决前被关押的日数，以一日抵徒刑一日，这又是我没有想到的事情。我认为这种宽大，是在中国一贯的和平政策的基础上产生的。”
    前日本陆军第三九师团第二三二联队本部中尉俘虏监督军官兼情报宣抚主任鹈野晋太郎请求记者把他的讲话告诉他在东京的母亲。今年只有三十六岁的鹈野晋太郎对记者说：“中国法庭对我判处了十三年的徒刑，而算日期又是从1945年8月20日算起。我感到有了光明的前途。”
    被判处十三年徒刑的制造细菌武器的榊原秀夫希望记者把以下的话转告他在日本的四个孩子：“你父亲一定不会辜负中国人民的宽大处理，努力成为一个真正的人。你父亲过去所走的道路是完全错误的，希望你们好好帮助母亲，努力学习，为了反对战争，为了和平而成为一个有用的人，你父亲从心里期待着你们。”
    在太原被判处十五年徒刑的相乐圭二从1937年参加侵华战争后，杀害过很多和平居民与抗日军被俘人员，在日本投降后又积极帮助阎锡山匪帮进行反革命战争。当法庭判决以后，他感动地说：“我的任何一条罪行都是够判处死刑的，而中国人民却仍然给我以重新做人的机会。他说：
  “我一定要在今后的刑期中努力改造自己，使自己变成一个真正有良心的人。”
    永富博之在听到判处他十三年徒刑以后感动地说：“这是我预料不到的宽大。”他原来设想的要比现在的判处“重的多”，他说他，除了好好服刑以外，“再没有任何别的想法”。永富博之最后说：“当我们的家属听到我们受到这样宽大的判处时，他们也会衷心地向中国人民致谢的。”
