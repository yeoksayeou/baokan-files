    Reading "A Draft History of Chinese Literature"
    Yu Guanying
    "A Draft History of Chinese Literature," co-authored by comrades Lu Kanru and Feng Yuanjun, has been fully published in the "Wen Shi Zhe" (Literature, History, Philosophy) magazine. The authors have previously written "A History of Chinese Poetry" and "A Concise History of Chinese Literature," and have a foundation in the study of Chinese literary history. In the preface to "A Concise History of Chinese Literature," written in 1932, they expressed the desire to use "new methods." This new work is an attempt to write from the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, readers have higher expectations for it.
    The book demonstrates a serious writing attitude, with very few unconventional arguments. The language is concise and to the point, with very little superfluous or idle talk. These are its merits.
    The book contains relatively rich material, especially in the sections on drama and fiction (such as Ming and Qing dramas and Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing vernacular stories). The authors have put in considerable research effort into certain materials they have handled, so those materials are generally reliable. Undoubtedly, readers who lack specific knowledge of Chinese literary history can benefit from it. However, readers' demands cannot stop there. They also want to know how the excellent tradition of literature developed in continuous struggles, how new trends germinated and replaced the old ones, under what historical conditions great writers emerged, what influence they had, and what the significance of great works throughout the ages is, both then and today. If a literary history can correctly explain these issues, it will have completed the tasks set forth in the book's "Introduction": "seeking the laws of literary development," "seeking the laws of the connection between literature and social life and class struggle," and "giving appropriate evaluations to important writers and important works." In these aspects, the book still cannot satisfy readers.
    As one of the readers, I would like to write down my thoughts after reading it, raise some questions and some immature opinions to consult with the authors and other researchers of Chinese literary history.
    I
    First of all, the periodization method of Chinese literary history in this book is worth discussing. The reason why literary history needs periodization is not only for the convenience of narration, but more importantly to reveal the decline of certain trends and the rise of others, to determine the qualitative differences between the various stages of literary development, and to reflect the objective laws of literary development. Precisely because history develops according to laws, there are certain natural paragraphs in the process, rather than being arbitrarily fitted with artificial frameworks. The book divides literary history into six stages, namely, the origin of literature (including Yin and Shang literature), the literature of the early feudal period (from King Wu's conquest of Shang to the unification of Qin), the literature of the middle feudal period (from Qin to the unification of Sui), the literature of the late feudal period (from Sui to the fall of Yuan), the literature of the late feudal period (from Ming to the Opium War), and the literature of the old democratic revolution period. It is not difficult to see that this uses the framework of social and historical development to fit literary history. Regardless of whether such a social and historical periodization is completely correct, even if it is completely correct, can it be mechanically applied to literary history? I think it cannot. Literary development is an aspect of the development of people's lives and is closely linked to the general development of society, but social changes are reflected in literature sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, sometimes significantly, and sometimes insignificantly. Therefore, the stages of general social development are not necessarily completely consistent with the stages of literary development. They are not "following step by step," without any difference. Our research on literary development must fully consider the economic, political, and cultural preconditions, but the direct object is literature itself. Because literature has relative independence, its development cannot be free from the objective laws inherent in itself. Therefore, considering the periodization of literary history must pay attention to the characteristics of literature itself and conform to the actual situation of the new and old changes in literature itself. It is obviously not enough to only consider it from the general development of society. The result of mechanically using the framework of social and historical periodization to fit literary history is that it cannot fully and correctly reflect the major changes in the process of literary development. For example, the literature of the Warring States period is obviously very different from the past. The new features are manifested in the rhyming prose of Qu Yuan and Song Yu, as well as in the prose of history and philosophy. The book draws the boundary between the Zhou and Qin dynasties instead of between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, which cannot show this change. Another example is that the decline of the anti-realist literary trend after the Liang and Chen dynasties and the rise of the realist literary trend were not significant until the Wu Zetian dynasty in the Tang Dynasty. The literature of the Sui Dynasty was basically the same as the old era, and even the difference between the literature of the early Tang Dynasty and the Liang and Chen dynasties was not obvious. The book's drawing of the boundary between the Chen and Sui dynasties also cannot reflect the actual situation. Some past literary history works mechanically divided the paragraphs according to dynasties, giving people the feeling of forcing a foot to fit a shoe. Does the above situation not give people the same impression?
    In fact, dividing the three-thousand-year-long Chinese literary history into only five or six paragraphs cannot be regarded as solving the problem of periodization. If we want to clearly and accurately reflect the laws of Chinese literary development, we must have more detailed periodization. The literature of the Eastern Han Dynasty Jian'an period and the Tang Dynasty Tianbao period cannot but be said to be "epoch-making." The consideration of literary history periodization cannot ignore these huge historical milestones. The periodization of Chinese literary history is a relatively complex issue that requires everyone who studies literary history to discuss. Here, I can only put forward some doubtful opinions for the time being. These opinions are not necessarily all accurate, but merely to illustrate that the problem of literary history periodization is not that simple. It is not solved by simply moving the existing periodization of general history to the literary field.
    II
    Now let's talk about the structural form of this book. The book is basically a combination of poetry history, prose history, fiction history, and drama history. This structural form is called "division by genre and combined compilation." The book divides the development of these four literary forms into five periods uniformly. Five periods and four forms, one vertical and one horizontal, form neat grids. Narrating historical facts by category and filling them in according to the grids results in some unreasonable phenomena. One of the unreasonable phenomena is that certain writers who have contributed to more than one genre are split apart. For example, Han Yu is split into two parts in this book because he has a place in both prose and poetry. Ouyang Xiu and Su Shi are divided into three parts because they are poets, lyricists, and prose writers. The result of this division is that the overall tendencies and overall achievements of these writers cannot be clearly highlighted. The authors even intentionally or unintentionally unilaterally emphasize the contribution of writers in one genre and belittle or obliterate the contribution of other genres. In this way, readers cannot get a comprehensive and complete understanding of these writers. For example, the literature of the Gong'an Three Yuan in the Ming Dynasty is representative of the progressive trend of anti-archaism. Their progressive trend is not only reflected in prose, but also in poetry. However, the book does not narrate their poetry, but only introduces them in prose. Readers who know nothing about the Three Yuan cannot help but misunderstand that their contribution and influence are only limited to prose. This is obviously not comprehensive.
    The second unreasonable phenomenon is that in order to prevent a certain genre from becoming a blank in each paragraph, some things that could have been omitted are dragged in. For example, the sections "The Germination of Drama" in the early feudal literature, "The Progress of Drama" in the middle feudal literature, and "Tang and Song Drama" in the late feudal literature in this book actually have no works to narrate. What is narrated are only the names, roles, and scenes of song and dance, acrobatics, etc. Strictly speaking, these should not belong to the scope of literary history.
    The third unreasonable phenomenon is the establishment of nondescript "appendixes" outside the four forms. The ci fu of the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties are arranged in the appendix to be narrated. The authors believe that ci fu is a literary form "between prose and rhyme," which cannot be classified as poetry or placed in prose, so it can only be arranged in this way. This arrangement shows that the various components of the book are not organically organized, but can be divided and combined, and cannot become a strict system.
    The fourth unreasonable phenomenon is that the classification is forced based only on the form of the work, regardless of the content. For example, Liu Xie's "Wen Xin Diao Long" and Zhong Rong's "Shi Pin" are narrated in the section "Prose of the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties." The book has no literary criticism category, so it has to be done this way. (If the book also introduces Sikong Tu's "Shi Pin," according to the book's format, it would have to be classified as poetry because it was written in rhyme.) In this way, the space occupied by "Wen Xin Diao Long" in the book is only about the same as that of "Shui Jing Zhu." The fact that literary criticism, which should have been emphasized, was unprecedentedly developed in the Liang Dynasty cannot be highlighted. Literary theory sometimes has a huge effect on literary development, so the position of literary criticism in literary history is not insignificant. The book's arrangement of "Wen Xin Diao Long" and Zhong Rong's "Shi Pin" fully exposes the shortcomings of the book's structure.
    Literary histories compiled by genre are most likely to be written as a running account because it is necessary to list all genres and to narrate the more important historical facts in each genre (which may not be important in the entire literary history). In this way, there cannot be too few listings, and the real key points are not easy to highlight. The objects that should be emphasized in literary history in each era are often different. Sometimes it is a certain type of literature, such as the Yuefu poems of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the literary criticism of the Liang Dynasty, the zaju dramas of the Yuan Dynasty, etc. Sometimes it is a literary group, such as the Yexia literati of the Three Kingdoms period, but it is often certain great writers, such as Qu Yuan in the Warring States period, Sima Qian in the Western Han Dynasty, Li Bai and Du Fu in the Tang Dynasty, etc. For writers who should be highlighted, independent chapters are often needed, and the genre grids cannot be broken through. Therefore, writing literary history cannot mechanically stipulate a uniform format from beginning to end, but can only flexibly design chapters to adapt to the complex and specific situation of the twists and turns of literary development. Some people say that using the traditional genre-compiled structure has one advantage, which is that the outline is clear. But we should distinguish between the clear outline of a ledger and the clear outline that can truly reflect the laws of literary development and meet the requirements of "history." Since we demand to use new methods to write a new Chinese literary history, we must study new problems. If our literary history works truly have new content, we will definitely not be satisfied with such an old form.
                            III
    Similar to the book's use of the framework of social history to fit literary history in terms of periodization methods, the book also has a tendency to mechanically and simply treat literary works as social history materials when narrating historical facts. When summarizing the literary overview of certain paragraphs, the authors routinely divide it into two sections: "Historical Background" and "Literary Overview," but some of the narrations in the latter section are still supplementary explanations or examples of the former section. For example, the "Literary Overview" in Chapter 15 focuses on narrating how the expansion of handicraft production and the prosperity of industrial towns are seen from the literature of this period, or which works describe merchants, and which works reflect the idea of opposing alien rule, etc. Little is said about the overall achievements and characteristics of the literature of this period itself. When introducing works separately, the book often shows that the authors first treat the works as social history materials, and secondly as works of art, and sometimes even forget that they are works of art. Regarding the vernacular story "Wang Xin's Death Saves the Whole Family," it repeatedly emphasizes that the protagonist "concurrently operates industry and handicraft." Regarding "Jin Yu Nu Beats the Unfaithful Husband," it particularly points out that it reflects the "Tuan Tou system." In the stories of Shi Runze, Jiang Xingge, Yang Ba Lao, the Transporting Han, and Xu Lao Pu, it only sees the reflection of the prosperity of handicrafts and commerce. For many works, it only talks about what they reflect, but does not mention how they reflect (the "reflection" mentioned is often an incomplete or superficial list of phenomena), indicating that the authors have ignored the characteristics of literature.
    The authors' research on the connection between literature and society does not start from the specific analysis of the work, but first determines the historical characteristics of a certain period, and then looks for reflections in the work. As a result, it often can only find some superficial and one-sided things, and it is inevitable to flow into subjective conjectures. Chapter 7 of the book puts forward a formula: "The contradiction between landlords and peasants is the most essential phenomenon of society during this period (note by the translator: referring to the period from the beginning of Qin to the beginning of Sui), and it must become the most basic theme of excellent works during this period." This formula is not summarized from specific historical facts, but is only the author's conjecture. The book does not cite facts to prove this "inevitability." Not only between Qin and Sui, but even in the literature of the entire feudal society in China, works like "Water Margin" that take the contradiction between peasants and landlords as the theme are extremely rare. Some works only reflect this contradiction indirectly, and many works do not reflect it. The excellence of a work cannot be measured from this perspective alone. If we require ancient literati to consciously express the main social contradictions like modern revolutionary writers, it will be in vain. Our modern great writer Lu Xun never directly wrote about workers in his novels. Can we therefore belittle Lu Xun and doubt the value of his works?
    The literary reflection of reality mentioned in this book often only refers to the direct description of the real life at that time. Therefore, it attaches importance to "directly taking materials from the real social life at that time," often measuring the social significance of the work only from the subject matter, so as to evaluate writers and works. The authors repeatedly listed the names of great ancient Chinese writers in the "Introduction" and "Conclusion" of the book. Among the poets, there is Bai Juyi but no Li Bai, and among the playwrights, there is Li Yu but no Wang Shifu. This is different from the public opinion in the past. The reasons held by the works have not been clearly stated, but as long as a comparison is made between the words and sentences of the book introducing these writers, it will be clear. It turns out that the reason why Bai Juyi can be ranked in the ranks of great ancient writers is because the "thematic thought" of his "Qin Zhong Yin" and "New Yuefu" is "very clear, mainly to criticize various unreasonable phenomena in society and politics, especially to mercilessly expose the crimes of the ruling class." Although Li Bai is also "the greatest poet before the flourishing Tang Dynasty," although "his romanticism is basically positive and is combined with realism," although his works also show "the noble qualities of loving the motherland and loving the people," he is after all "a romantic poet." He did not expose the darkness of politics at that time as clearly and widely as Bai Juyi, so he cannot be ranked in the ranks of great ancient writers. Li Yu is great because some of his works "directly take materials from the real social life at that time, the political tendency is relatively clear, and the struggle is relatively strong." His work "Qing Zhong Pu" "expresses the fighting enthusiasm of the masses resisting the public enemy of the people in writing about the struggle between Zhou Shunchang and Wei Zhongxian." And Wang Shifu's "Romance of the West Chamber" although "makes him gain honors that are difficult for other playwrights to obtain," although "its achievement is first established on its strong ideological nature," its significance is only "opposing arranged marriages by parents, opposing marriages forced by money or power, and opposing the stifling of sincere love between young men and women." In the authors' opinion, Li Bai's realism needs to be discounted, and the social significance of "Romance of the West Chamber" is not as significant as "Qing Zhong Pu." It is not difficult to see that the authors have vulgarized both realism and the ideological nature of literature, and regard the artistic nature of the work as too insignificant. Li Bai's poems, from the perspective of its expression, have more romanticism. From the basic spirit of the work, it belongs to the category of realism, just like the poems of Du Fu and Bai Juyi. Romanticism is not a shortcoming for a great writer of realism, but it is often an important factor in the inspiration and infection of the work. Do Du Fu's poems have no romanticism? Bai Juyi's poems, such as "Song of Everlasting Regret," have no romanticism? It is a very clear principle that we cannot belittle the status of writers because their works are rich in romanticism.
    The spirit of realism is not only expressed in taking materials from real life. Although some works write about ideal things and fictional realms, its spirit can still be realistic, and it can be more realistic than some works that describe real life. Take "Journey to the West" as an example. The heavenly palace, the spirit world, the immortals, Buddhas, demons, and ghosts written in the book are not found in reality, but it reflects the life, thoughts, feelings, and wishes of the people. Can we say that its spirit is not realistic? Some works in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" can also illustrate the same problem. Therefore, it is inappropriate to distinguish the merits of works solely based on whether they directly take materials from the real social life at that time. It is difficult for us to say that the value of "Golden Lotus" must be higher than that of "Journey to the West."
    Whether a work describes major social events or expresses class struggle cannot be used as the only standard for measuring the height of ideology. In addition to what is written, we must also look at how it is written. From the surface, the love between a young couple is a small matter in society, but through this theme, it can also express the significance of anti-ritualism and anti-feudalism. The size of the social significance of a work cannot be viewed solely from the subject matter, but from the overall effect after artistic expression. A small subject matter may contain great significance, and this significance often only becomes apparent after being expressed by a great writer. What "Dream of the Red Chamber" describes is mainly what happened in a feudal family. Compared with "Water Margin," its subject matter is not large, but we feel that this work criticizes the entire feudal society, and it seems to predict that the feudal landlord class will inevitably move towards extinction. Is its social significance still small? Who can say that the ideological nature of this novel must be lower than "Water Margin"?
    The book only acknowledges that "Qin Zhong Yin" and "New Yuefu" are Bai Juyi's masterpieces, and says in general that his "sentimental poems" and "leisurely poems" are "negative works." This narrows the achievements of this writer. Only seeing the greatness of Bai Juyi, but not seeing the greatness of Li Bai, only promoting the reality of Yuan, Ming, and Qing sanqu, xiaqu, and daoqing as the representative of poetry at that time to narrate, and obliterating all the five- and seven-character poems of these generations, this narrows the scope of literature and makes the beautiful and rich content of ancient Chinese literature not fully reflected in literary history. This narrow concept is obviously harmful.
    It should also be pointed out that the authors' method of finding social significance in the works is sometimes to cut the works apart. The book often only cites one or two sentences in some works to illustrate the writer's thoughts and the value of the works, instead of analyzing the entire work. This method is wrong. For example, regarding Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret," only emphasizing its "critical nature" based on the few words "The Han Emperor values beauty and thinks of alluring countries" cannot correctly explain this work. More seriously, the work originally has no certain meaning, but it is far-fetched and distorted to paste a certain label on it. For example, saying that "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" is "using fox ghosts to condemn the ruling class" is untenable. The author clearly writes many fox ghosts into lovable images, which cannot be obliterated? The thoughts reflected in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" are complex and contradictory, and cannot be summarized in such a general way. The book also says that the character of Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West" belongs to the working people, and the character of Zhu Bajie belongs to the parasitic class. This opposition between the two images not only obliterates the good side of Zhu Bajie's character, but also obliterates the relationship between Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie as comrades-in-arms. In addition, the book also says that the story of the Peach Garden Oath in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is so popular with the masses only because Liu Bei is engaged in weaving straw sandals and selling straw mats, Zhang Fei sells meat, and Guan Yu pushes carts. The authors not only see the problem too simply, but also see the masses too simply. It seems that what the masses appreciate is neither the artistic image in the book, nor the character of the hero, but only the background of the characters. From this, it can be inferred that the friendship between Yang Jiaoai and Zuo Botao, the friendship between Fan Shi and Zhang Shao, the love between Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, and the acquaintance between Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu cannot be appreciated by the masses, because the backgrounds of these characters do not belong to the lower class of society. Is this really the case?
    From the above situation, the book's explanation of the phenomena in literary history has many subjective, one-sided, mechanical, simple, and formulaic places. It often lacks specific analysis, especially artistic analysis, and ignores the characteristics of literature. It should be said that the book has a strong atmosphere of vulgar sociology. This is the main shortcoming of the book.
    Because the book has a tendency towards vulgar sociology, coupled with a certain degree of formalism, it is impossible to reveal the true laws of literary development and complete the tasks proposed by the authors themselves. It can only list phenomena, narrate plainly, and write literary history as a running account. The book lists all genres in parallel, and lists writers in parallel under each genre. The narration is very brief. The connection between one genre and another cannot be seen, and the inheritance relationship between writers cannot be seen. Not only are the key writers and works not prominent enough, but the opposing different tendencies and different schools are not clear enough. Therefore, readers cannot get a clear understanding of the overall picture of literature in each era, and the impression of the development process of the entire Chinese literary tradition is inevitably blurred.
    What we need today is a Chinese literary history with a completely new look, which truly uses the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method to correctly introduce writers and works, and correctly explain the laws of literary development. Of course, the production of such a Chinese literary history cannot be realized in a short time. In the process of achieving this goal, there will inevitably be various difficulties, twists, and errors, and it must go through free debates of various different opinions and the accumulation of experience from various hard work. Everything is difficult at the beginning, and the efforts of those who dare to start are always worth gratitude. We cannot demand perfection from the beginning. However, we believe that at present, we can also put forward a minimum requirement, that is, to make a basically correct explanation of the known historical facts, to make a basically correct evaluation of writers and works, to clarify the correlation of certain important phenomena in literary history, and to strive to avoid subjective one-sidedness and the tendency of vulgar sociology. It is certain that such a request can be achieved by making a serious modification and supplement based on the book.

    读“中国文学史稿”
    余冠英
    陆侃如、冯沅君两同志合著的“中国文学史稿”已在“文史哲”杂志全部发表。著者在解放前曾写过“中国诗史”和“中国文学史简编”，对于中国文学史的研究是具有基础的。他们在1932年所写的“中国文学史简编”的序例中已经表示运用“新方法”的要求，这部新著正是企图运用马克思列宁主义的观点方法来写的。因此，读者对它的希望比较高。
    本书写作态度严肃，绝少标奇立异的议论。语言简明扼要，绝少浮辞闲话。这些都是它的优点。
    本书的材料是比较丰富的，戏曲、小说部分尤其充实（例如明、清戏曲和宋、元、明、清话本）。著者对于他们所处理的某些材料曾下过考订功夫，因此那些材料大都可靠。无疑，缺乏中国文学史具体知识的读者可以从其中得到不少的益处。不过读者的要求不能仅止于此，他们还希望知道：文学的优良传统如何在不断的斗争中发展起来，新倾向怎样萌芽，怎样代替了旧的，在什么历史条件下产生了哪些伟大作家，他们又发生了如何的影响，历代伟大作品在当时和今天有什么意义等等。文学史如果能正确地说明这些问题，也就是完成了本书“引言”所提出的任务：“寻求文学发展的规律”、“寻求文学和社会生活与阶级斗争联系的规律”和“给重要作家与重要作品以适当的估价”。在这些方面，本书还不能使读者得到满足。
    作为读者之一，我愿意把自己读后的感想写出来，提出一些问题和一些不成熟的意见向著者和中国文学史的其他研究者请教。
    一
    首先，本书对于中国文学史的分期方法是值得商榷的。文学史之所以需要分期不仅是为了叙述的方便，更重要的是揭示某些倾向的衰落和另一些倾向的兴起，确定文学发展各段之间质的区别，反映出文学发展的客观规律性。正因为历史是有规律地发展着的，所以在过程中有一定的自然的段落，而不是可以用人为的框子随意去套的。本书把文学史分了六个段落，即文学的起源（包括殷商文学），封建初期（武王克商至秦统一）的文学，封建中期（秦至隋统一）的文学，封建后期（隋至元亡）的文学，封建末期（明至鸦片战争）的文学及旧民主主义革命时期的文学。不难看出，这是以社会历史发展的框子来套文学史。且不论这样的社会历史分期是否完全正确，即使是完全正确的，是否能机械地搬用于文学史呢？我想是不能的。文学发展是人民生活发展的一个方面，和社会一般发展是紧密联系着的，但是社会变化反映到文学上来有时快，有时慢，有时显著，有时不显著，因此社会一般发展的阶段未必和文学发展的阶段完全一致，彼此不是
  “步亦步趋亦趋”，丝毫没有参差的，我们研究文学的发展一定要充分估计到经济、政治、文化等前提条件，但直接的对象是文学本身。因为文学有相对的独立性，它的发展不能不受其自身所固有的客观规律所制约，所以考虑文学史的分期必须注意文学本身的特点，符合文学本身的新旧代变的实际情况。仅仅从社会一般发展考虑显然是不够的。本书机械地用社会历史分期的框子来套文学史的结果，就不能完全正确地反映文学发展过程中的重大变化。例如战国时期的文学显然是和过去大不相同的，新的面貌既表现于屈原、宋玉的韵文，也表现于历史和哲学的散文，本书将段落的界线划在周秦之际而不在春秋战国之间，就不能显示这一变化。又如梁陈以后反现实主义的文学倾向之衰落与现实主义的文学倾向之抬头要到唐代武后朝才显著，隋代的文学基本上是同于旧时代的，甚至唐初的文学和梁陈文学的区别也还是不明显的。本书将界线划在陈隋之间也不能反映实际情况。过去的某些文学史著作机械地按朝代划分段落，使人有削足适履之感，上述的情况难道不给人同样的印象么？
    其实，对于长达三千年的中国文学史仅仅划分为五六个段落，并不能算是解决了分期的问题，如要求明晰准确地反映中国文学发展的规律性，还必须有更细密的分期。像东汉建安时期和唐代天宝时期的文学不能不说是“划时代”的，考虑文学史分期不能忽视这些巨大的历史里程碑。中国文学史的分期问题是一个比较复杂的，需要研究文学史的人大家来讨论的问题。在这里，暂时还只能提出一些怀疑的意见。这些意见不一定都准确，仅仅是为了说明文学史的分期问题不是这样简单，不是把现成的一般历史的分期搬到文学方面就解决了问题而已。
    二
    现在再来谈谈这本书的结构形式。本书基本上是诗史、散文史、小说史、戏剧史的拼合，这种结构形式有人称之为“分体合编”。本书将这四体文学的发展一律划分为五期。五期四体，一纵一横，便形成整齐的格子。将史实分类叙述，依格填写，结果便产生一些不合理的现象。不合理的现象之一就是把某些不止在一种体裁上有贡献的作家分割开来。例如韩愈在本书中就是被分割成两片的，因为在散文和诗歌中都有他的地位。欧阳修和苏轼就是被分成三片的，因为他们既是诗人，又是词人，也是散文家。这样分割的结果就不能鲜明突出地揭示这些作家的总倾向和总成就，著者甚至有意无意地片面强调了作家某一体的贡献而贬低或抹煞了另外某些体的贡献，这样，读者就不能得到关于这些作家的全面的完整的认识。举一个例子来说，明代公安三袁的文学是反复古的进步倾向的代表，他们的进步倾向不仅表现在散文，同时也表现在诗歌。可是本书并不叙述他们的诗歌，只在散文里介绍了他们。对于三袁本无所知的读者就不免误会他们的贡献和影响仅限于散文了，这显然是不全面的。
    不合理的现象之二是为了使得每一段落中不至有某一体成为空白，就拉扯上一些本可不叙的东西。例如本书在封建初期文学中“戏剧的萌芽”一节，封建中期文学中“戏剧的进展”一节和封建后期文学中“唐宋戏剧”一节实际并无作品可叙，所叙的只是歌舞、杂技的名目、脚色和场面等等，严格说来，这些都不应属于文学史的范围。
    不合理的现象之三是四体之外又设不伦不类的“附论”。汉魏六朝的辞赋就是安排在附论里来叙述的。著者认为辞赋是介乎“散文与韵文之间”的文学形式，既不能归入诗歌一类，也不能放在散文之中，所以只能这样安排。这种安排说明本书的各个组成部分并不是有机地组织起来，而是可分可合，不能成为严密的系统。
    不合理的现象之四是只凭作品的形式勉强归类，不管内容。例如刘勰的“文心雕龙”和钟嵘的“诗品”是放在“魏晋南北朝的散文”一节里叙述的。本书没有文学批评一类，所以只好这么办。（假如本书也介绍司空图的“诗品”，按照本书的体例就不得不归入诗歌类了，因为那是用韵语写的。）这样一来，“文心雕龙”在本书中所占的篇幅只和“水经注”差不多，原该着重叙述的文学批评在梁代空前发达这一事实就无法突出了。文学理论有时在文学发展上是有巨大作用的，因此文学批评在文学史上的地位并不是无足轻重。本书对于“文心雕龙”和钟嵘的“诗品”的安排充分暴露了本书结构的缺点。
    分体合编的文学史最容易写成流水账，因为既要备列众体又要备叙每一体中比较重要的史实（在全部文学史中可能并不重要），这样，罗列就不能不多，真正的重点反而不易突出。在文学史里各个时代应该着重叙写的对象往往是不同的，有时是某一类的文学，如东汉的乐府诗，梁代的文学批评，元代的杂剧等等，有时是一个文学集团，如三国时代的邺下文人，但常常是某些伟大作家，如战国时的屈原，西汉的司马迁，唐朝的李白、杜甫等等。对于应该突出的作家，往往需要独立的章节，不能不突破文体的格子。因此写文学史不能机械地规定一个首尾一律的格式，只能适应文学发展的曲折变化的复杂的具体情况灵活地设计章节。有人说使用传统的分体合编的结构有一种好处，就是眉目清楚，但是我们应该辨别账簿式的眉目清楚和真正能反映文学发展规律的合于“史”的要求的眉目清楚。我们既要求运用新方法写出新的中国文学史来，就必须钻研新问题，假如我们的文学史著作真正有了新的内容，就一定不会满足于这样的旧形式了。

    和本书在分期方法上所表现的用社会历史的框子来套文学史相类似，本书在叙述史实的时候也有将文学作品机械地、简单地
    当做社会史材料的倾向。著者在总述某些段落的文学概况时照例分为“历史的背景”与“文学的鸟瞰”两节，但在后一节里有些叙述仍然是前一节的补充说明或举例。例如第十五章的“文学的鸟瞰”着重叙述了从这时期的文学看到手工业如何扩大生产，工业市镇如何扩大繁荣，或是哪些作品描写了商人，哪些作品反映了反对异族统治的思想等等。对于这一时期文学本身的总成就和特征却很少讲到。本书在分别介绍作品的时候也常常表现著者对于作品首先是当做社会史料来对待，其次才是看做艺术品，有时甚至忘了它是艺术品。对于话本“汪信之一死救全家”一再强调主人公“兼营工业与手工业”。对于“金玉奴棒打薄情郎”特别指出它反映了“团头制度”。在施润泽、蒋兴哥、杨八老、转运汉、徐老仆的故事中，仅仅看到手工业与商业盛况的反映。对于许多作品只谈到它们反映了什么，而不提如何反映（所谈到的“反映”又往往是不完全的或表面现象的罗列），说明著者对于文学的特点是忽略了的。
    著者研究文学和社会的联系不是从作品的具体分析出发，而是先确定某一时期的历史特征，然后到作品中找反映。结果往往只能发现一些表面、片面的东西，而且不免流于主观附会。本书第七章提出了一条公式：“地主与农民的矛盾是这时（笔者按：指从秦初到隋初）社会最本质的现象，必然成为这时优秀作品最基本的主题。”这条公式不是从具体史实概括出来的，仅仅是著者想当然的臆断。本书并未举出事实来证明这种“必然”。不但在秦隋之间，就是在中国整个封建社会的文学里，像“水浒传”那样以表现农民和地主的矛盾为主题的作品也是极其稀少的，有些作品只是曲折地反映了这一矛盾，许多作品并不反映。作品的优秀与否断不能只从这一个角度去衡量。我们如果像要求现代革命作家似的要求古代文人自觉地表现社会主要矛盾，那是要落空的。我们的现代伟大作家鲁迅在他的小说里也不曾直接写过工人。难道能因此菲薄鲁迅，而怀疑他的作品的价值么？
    本书所谈到的文学反映现实往往仅指对于当时现实生活的直接描写，因此重视“直接取材于当时社会的现实生活”，往往只从题材衡量作品的社会意义，从而评价作家和作品。著者在本书的“引言”和“结语”中两度历举中国古代伟大作家的名字，在诗人中有白居易而无李白，在戏曲作家中有李玉而无王实甫，这和向来的公评是不同的。著作所持的理由不曾明说，但是只要将本书介绍这几位作家的词句做一番比较就明白了。原来白居易所以能排在古代伟大作家的行列里，是因为他的“秦中吟”和“新乐府”的“主题思想非常明确，主要是批判社会上、政治上种种不合理的现象，特别对于统治阶级的罪行予以无情的揭发。”李白虽然也是“盛唐以前最伟大的诗人”，虽然“他的浪漫主义基本上是积极的，是与现实主义相结合的”，虽然他的作品中也表现了“爱祖国、爱人民的高贵品质”，但是，他终究是“一个浪漫主义的诗人”，不曾像白居易那样明确地广泛地揭露当时政治上的黑暗面，所以就不能排在古代伟大作家的行列里。李玉之所以伟大，因为他的作品“有些是直接取材于当时社会的现实生活，政治倾向性比较鲜明，斗争性比较强烈”，他的作品“清忠谱”“在写周顺昌与魏忠贤的斗争中……表现着群众抵抗人民公敌的战斗热情”。而王实甫的“西厢记”虽然“使他获得其他剧作家所难得的荣誉”，虽然“它的成就首先建立在它的强烈的思想性上”，它的意义不过是“反对父母包办的婚姻，反对借金钱或势力强迫成功的婚姻，反对扼杀青年男女真挚的爱”。在著者看来，李白的现实主义是要打折扣的，“西厢记”的社会意义是不如“清忠谱”重大的。不难看出，著者把现实主义和文学的思想性都庸俗化了，把作品的艺术性看得太无足重轻了。李白的诗，从它的表现方式看来，有较多的浪漫主义色彩。从作品的基本精神看来，它是和杜甫、白居易的诗一样，属于现实主义的范畴的。浪漫主义色彩对于一个现实主义的伟大作家不但不是一个缺点，而且往往是作品的鼓舞、感染力量的重要因素。杜甫的诗难道没有浪漫主义色彩？白居易的诗，如“长恨歌”等何尝没有浪漫主义色彩？不能因为作品富于浪漫主义色彩而贬低作家的地位，这是很清楚的道理。
    现实主义精神并非只表现于从现实生活取材。有些作品尽管写的是理想的事物，虚构的境界，它的精神却仍然可以是现实主义的，也可以比某些描写现实生活的作品更现实。就拿“西游记”来说，书中所写的天宫、灵界、仙、佛、妖魔都非现实中所有，但是它反映了人民的生活、人民的思想感情和愿望，我们能说它的精神不是现实主义的么？“聊斋志异”中的一些作品也可以说明同样的问题。因此单凭是否直接取材于当时的现实生活来分别作品的高下是不妥当的，我们很难说“金瓶梅”的价值一定比
  “西游记”高些。
    作品是否描写了社会上的重大事件或是否表现阶级斗争，也不能作为衡量思想性高低的唯一标准。除了写什么之外还得看怎么写。一对青年男女的恋爱从表面看来它是社会上的一件小事，但通过这种题材也可以表现出反礼教反封建的意义。作品的社会意义大小不能单从题材来看，要从经过艺术表现后的总效果来看。小题材也可能含有大意义，这种意义往往经过伟大作家表现之后才显出来。“红楼梦”所描写的主要是一个封建家庭中所发生的事情，比起“水浒”来，它的题材是并不大的，但我们却觉得这一部作品批判了整个的封建社会，而且好像预言了封建地主阶级必然走向灭亡一样，难道它的社会意义还小么？谁能说这部小说的思想性一定低于“水浒”呢？
    本书只承认“秦中吟”和“新乐府”是白居易的杰作，而笼统地说他的“感伤诗”和“闲适诗”是“消极的作品”，这样就把这个作家的成就缩小了。只看见白居易的伟大，而看不见李白的伟大，只推重元明清散曲、小曲和道情的现实性，作为当时诗歌的代表来叙述，而抹煞这几代的所有的五七言诗，这就把文学的范围缩小，使中国古代文学的优美丰富的内容在文学史上得不到完全的反映了。这种狭隘观念显然是有害的。
    还应该指出，著者在作品中寻找社会意义的方法有时是割裂作品的。本书常常只举出某些作品中的一两句来说明作家的思想和作品的价值，而不是就整个作品来分析，这种方法是错误的。例如对于白居易的“长恨歌”，仅仅据“汉皇重色思倾国”少数字句强调它的“批判性”，就不能正确地说明这一作品。更严重的是作品本来没有某种意义而附会歪曲地贴上某种标签。如说“聊斋志异”是“借狐鬼来谴责统治阶级”，这是讲不通的，作者明明把许多狐鬼写成可爱的形象，难道是可以抹煞的么？“聊斋志异”所反映的思想是复杂矛盾的，断不能这样笼统地概括。本书又说“西游记”里孙悟空的性格是属于劳动人民的，猪八戒的性格是属于寄生阶级的。这样把两个形象对立起来，不但抹煞了猪八戒性格中良善的一面，而且也抹煞了孙悟空和猪八戒的战友的关系了。此外，本书还说“三国演义”中的桃园结义故事所以为广大群众所乐道，只是因为刘备是以织屦贩席为业的，张飞是卖肉的，关羽是推车子的。著者不但把问题看得太简单，也把群众看得太简单了。好像群众所欣赏的既不是书中的艺术形象，也不是英雄人物的品德，而只是人物的出身。由此推论，羊角哀和左伯桃的友谊，范式和张劭的交情，梁山伯和祝英台的恋爱，贾宝玉和林黛玉的相知都不能使群众欣赏，因为这些人物的出身都不是属于社会的下层。事实何尝是这样呢？
    从上述的情况看来，本书解释文学史上的现象，有不少主观、片面、机械、简单、公式化的地方。常常缺乏具体分析，特别是艺术性的分析，忽视文学的特点。应该说本书的庸俗社会学的气息是浓厚的。这是本书主要的缺点。
    由于本书有庸俗社会学的倾向，加上一定程度的形式主义倾向，就不可能揭示文学发展的真正的规律，完成著者自己所提出的任务。只能罗列现象，平铺直叙，把文学史写成流水账了。本书平列众体，每体之下平列作家。叙述又十分简略。这一体与那一体之间看不出联系，作家与作家之间看不出继承关系。不但重点的作家作品不够突出，而且对立的不同倾向，不同派别也不够显明。因此读者对于每一个时代文学的全貌不能得到清楚的认识，对于中国整个文学传统的发展过程印象更不免模糊了。
    我们今天需要的中国文学史应该是面貌一新的，是真正运用马克思列宁主义的观点方法正确地介绍作家作品，正确地说明文学的发展规律的。当然，这样一部中国文学史的产生，不是在短时间内就能实现的。在达到这个目的的过程中，免不了种种困难、曲折和错误，而且必须经过种种不同意见的自由争辩，种种辛勤劳动的经验积累。万事起头难，勇于起头的人们的努力总是值得感激的，我们不能一开始就责备求全。不过我们以为，目前还可以提一个最低的要求，就是把已知的史实作基本正确的说明，对于作家作品作基本正确的评价，将文学史上的某些重要现象的关联性叙述清楚，力求避免主观片面和庸俗社会学的倾向。在本书的基础上作一番认真的修改和补充，这样的要求一定是可以达到的。
