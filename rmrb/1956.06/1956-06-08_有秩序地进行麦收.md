    Conduct Wheat Harvesting in an Orderly Manner
    The Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengnan Street, Chengguan Town, Tongguan County, Shaanxi Province, experienced some issues during the wheat harvest. Some cooperative members, only concerned with work points, were willing to cut good wheat but not bad wheat, willing to cut upright wheat but not fallen wheat, and willing to cut tall wheat but not short wheat. Some members, lacking wheat-cutting skills, left high stubble and dropped many ears of wheat. There were fewer people cutting wheat and more people gleaning. Gleaners were pulling and grabbing randomly, with no one overseeing them. Some elderly female members deliberately left wheat behind for their children to glean. Some production teams, in order to rush time and meet targets, harvested wheat that was not fully ripe.
    The reasons for these phenomena are, firstly, a lack of collectivist ideological education for the members, and secondly, poor labor organization. Because the division of labor was unclear and responsibilities were not defined, the members' sense of responsibility was also lacking. In some production teams, there were many people standing in the fields and few bundles of wheat on the threshing ground. This wasted manpower, and the cut wheat could not be brought back in time. If the weather changes, there will be losses.
    The cooperative's management committee has taken note of this problem and educated the members on "loving the cooperative as their home," proposing "more points for those who harvest more and harvest well, fewer points for those who waste wheat," and commending the members who did a good job in harvesting. Furthermore, they have reorganized the labor force and further divided labor and tasks.

    有秩序地进行麦收
    陕西省潼关县城关镇城内街先锋农业生产合作社，在麦收当中，有些社员光贪图工分，割麦愿割好的不愿割坏的，愿割直立的不愿割倒的，愿割高的不愿割低的。有些社员因为不懂割麦技术，麦槎留的高，麦穗丢得多。割麦的人少，拾麦的人多。拾麦的乱拔乱抢，没人过问。有些年老的女社员，割麦的时候故意遗下麦子让自己的孩子拾。有些生产队为了赶时间赶任务，把不十分熟的麦子也收割了。
    发生这些现象的原因，一个是对社员缺乏集体主义的思想教育，一个是劳动组织不好。因为分工不明，责任不清，社员的责任心也就差了。在有的生产队里，地里站的人多，场里放的麦少。既浪费了人力，割了的麦也不能及时收回来。天时一变，就会遭受损失。
    社的管理委员会已经注意这个问题，对社员进行了“爱社如家”的教育，提出“收得多收得好的多分，糟蹋麦子的少分”，表扬了收割工作做得好的社员；并且整顿了劳动组织，进一步进行了分工分业。
