Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The Wuhan Public Security Bureau's arrest of Jiao Zhibin, a special agent who refused to surrender himself, and was Chiang Kai-shek's "Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense" and a "omnipotent intelligence agent," has been filmed into a news documentary by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio.

This news documentary was filmed by the cameraman and the public security personnel executing the arrest together on the scene. When the public security personnel arrested the criminal Jiao, the criminal Jiao was setting up a radio station and starting to communicate with the Taiwan spy agency. Before being arrested, the criminal Jiao went to a bank to withdraw funds for espionage activities, and the cameraman, with the help of the public security agency, captured his actions on film.

The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio has edited this short film together with a documentary short film about Zhang Yi, a special agent from Hangzhou People's Procuratorate who was treated leniently for surrendering himself and made great contributions, and named it "Two Roads". It will be screened in major cities starting in mid-June.

    逮捕焦志彬现场情况拍成电影
    新华社9日讯　武汉市公安机关逮捕拒不自首投案的特务分子、蒋介石“国防部二厅”“万能情报员”焦志彬的现场情况，已经由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍摄成新闻纪录电影。
    这个新闻纪录电影是摄影师和执行逮捕任务的公安人员一同进入现场拍摄的。当公安人员逮捕焦犯的时候，焦犯正架好电台，开始和台湾的特务机关通报。焦犯在被捕前有一次到银行里去兑取特务活动经费，摄影师也在公安机关的帮助下把他的行动摄入了镜头。
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂已经把这个短片同杭州市人民检察院宽大处理自首投案、并且立了大功的特务分子张毅的纪录短片编辑在一起，片名“两条道路”，六月中旬起将在各大中城市上映。
