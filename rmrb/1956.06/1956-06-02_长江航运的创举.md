A Pioneering Achievement in Yangtze River Shipping
By our reporter Cao Baoming

One afternoon in May, a faint mist shrouded the calm river. The white smoke from the sailing ships and the factories on the shore coalesced into clumps of white, flocculent clouds, gradually dissipating in the rain. At this moment, in the anchorage in front of the Wuhan Riverside Park, the "Yangtze 503" was forming a fleet with three large iron barges, each with a carrying capacity of 500 tons, one after another, connected into a column more than 200 meters long. The sailors on the surrounding ships were all paying attention to the movements of this fleet.

This was Captain F.V. Belmiakov of the Volga River transmitting his experience in the "in-line pushing method" on the Yangtze River.

Since 1951, the Yangtze River sailors have learned the Soviet "in-line towing method," which increased the towing capacity per horsepower by seven times. Since 1953, they have learned the Soviet "pushing method," which increased the speed of the ship by 20% compared to the "in-line towing method." The speed of the "pushing method" mainly depends on how the fleet formation is organized. The Yangtze River sailors have learned to assemble many formations such as "multi-row," "balance," and "swallow," but they have never learned to assemble the "in-line" pushing formation with the highest speed. They also tried to connect two barges and a tugboat one by one with cables to form this "in-line" pushing formation. However, the fleet had not traveled far from the anchorage and was in the process of turning when the front barge was skewed by the current because the cables were not tied tightly, the cables were broken, and the fleet was scattered. Therefore, many experiments failed.

When the Soviet advanced producers delegation for maritime and inland river transportation came to Wuhan, the comrades from the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau and the inland river bureaus of nine provinces asked them how to assemble the "in-line" pushing formation. Belmiakov, the captain of the tugboat "Vishinsky," who was among the first to implement the pushing method in the Soviet Union, reported on his work experience on the Volga River. At this time, some people began to discuss: "It turns out that the barges in the Soviet Union are square at both ends! Of course, two ships can be connected together to form a whole. Our barges have round bottoms and pointed heads, how can two ships stay together firmly?" "The Soviet ships have connectors and a lot of equipment, and they are mechanically or electrically operated, but our equipment is poor." "The Volga River has a wider channel and a slower current than ours." These comrades believed at this time that the reason for the past failures was that the conditions for Yangtze River shipping were different from those in the Soviet Union.

However, Belmiakov, the captain of the "Vishinsky" tugboat, who had won the All-Union Socialist Competition several times, believed that the existing equipment on the Yangtze River could be used to assemble a "in-line" pushing fleet of three barges. At the same time, once the "in-line" pushing formation of three ships is learned, it will be easier to assemble other formations.

In order to combine the advanced experience of the Volga River with the specific conditions of the Yangtze River, Belmiakov made a special trip to the upstream anchorage to observe the formation of a fleet in detail, and specifically understood the structure of the Yangtze River ships and the method of tying cables. He worked until after three o'clock in the morning without rest; he also asked for drawing paper and triangular scales to carefully draw the formation diagram of the "in-line" pushing fleet.

Belmiakov personally directed the trial of the "in-line pushing method." Everyone was very excited that day. The crew of the "Yangtze 503" pusher cleaned the ships spotlessly early in the morning, carefully checked the machinery on the ship, and the old captain Liu Qingtang specially put on his captain's uniform with four gold stripes embroidered on the cuffs, waiting for the distinguished guest to impart this advanced experience. However, due to the failure of several previous experiments, some people still doubted whether this advanced experience could work on the Yangtze River.

The rain became heavier and heavier. The smooth iron barges were so wet that they could reflect people's images. Belmiakov still stood high on the stern of the front barge, asking the flagpole and anchor davit of the rear barge to be aligned with the white light at the stern of the front ship. Then, he and the sailors changed the "single-strand herringbone cable" (a form of cable tying) that had been tied in the past to "double-strand cross cable," and used iron rods to pass through the middle of the two strands of cable, twisting the cable tightly like twisting hemp. He went to the three ships to check again, stepping on the cable to test whether it was tightened. Finally, he returned to the operating platform of the pusher to prepare for departure.

As soon as the ship started, the cables of the foremost barge loosened a little, and the entire fleet was not in a straight line. Everyone was worried, but after the front cable continued to tighten, the fleet moved like a single ship.

At 5:30, the first "in-line" pushing fleet on the Yangtze River sailed upstream. This fleet, more than 200 meters long, traveled so lightly that even the helmsman felt it was easier to steer than usual. After a while, it passed the repair dock, passed the clock tower of the Wuhan Customs, and clearly saw the eight bridge piers of the Yangtze River Bridge construction site. Old Captain Liu Qingtang also estimated the speed in his mind: it was about one and a half nautical miles faster per hour than usual. When this nearly half-mile-long fleet turned around in the middle of the river and quickly sailed downstream, the sailors watching on the "Jiangxin" and "Minzhu" and other large passenger ships on the shore could not help but wave and cheer. Then the fleet turned around again downstream and sailed back to the anchorage.

The "in-line pushing method" was successfully tested on the Yangtze River! The facts answered all kinds of doubts. Everyone was so excited that they applauded and cheered, and the ship sounded three whistles to congratulate and pay tribute to the Soviet captain who guided the experiment. The crew of the "Yangtze 503" presented the award flag they had won at the recent First Yangtze River Advanced Producers Representative Conference to Comrade Belmiakov.

At this time, many sailors sincerely expressed the changes in their mood during this one-hour trial voyage, and guaranteed to promote this advanced experience in their units. Old Captain Liu Qingtang of the "Yangtze 503" also patted his chest and said: "I request the higher authorities to transfer two large barges of 2,000 tons, and we are responsible for promoting this experience in the narrow midstream with many bends."

    长江航运的创举
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    五月里的一天下午，平静的江上罩着一层淡淡的薄雾。航行的轮船和岸边的工厂的白烟，凝聚成了一团团白絮似的烟云，在雨中渐渐消散。这时，在武汉滨江公园前面的停泊区里，“长江五○三”轮正带着三艘载重五百吨的大铁驳船在编组船队，一艘紧接着一艘，连成了一条两百多公尺长的纵队。周围的船只上的海员们，都在注意着这个船队的动静。
    这是伏尔加河的船长弗·瓦·别尔米亚科夫在长江传授“一列式顶推法”的经验。
    长江的海员们，从1951年起就学习了苏联的“一列式拖带法”，使每马力的拖载量提高了七倍；1953年起又学习了苏联的“顶推法”，使船的航速又比“一列式拖带法”，提高了20％。“顶推法”的航速的高低，主要决定于船队队形编的怎样。长江的海员们学会了编组“多排式”、“天平式”、“燕子式”等许多种队形，但是他们始终没有学会编组航速最高的“一列式”顶推的队形。他们也曾经把两条驳船和一条拖轮一只只地用缆索连结起来，试编这种“一列式”顶推队形。但是，船队刚从停泊区驶出不远，正在掉头转弯的时候，前面的驳船就因为缆索系得不紧，被流水冲歪，缆索被别断了，船队给冲散了。因此，多次试验都没有成功。
    当苏联海上和内河运输先进生产者代表团来到武汉的时候，长江航运局和九个省的内河局的同志们便向他们提出了怎样编组“一列式”顶推队形的问题。别尔米亚科夫，这位在苏联首批实行顶推法的船长，报告了他在伏尔加河上的工作经验。这时候，有些人便议论纷纷：“原来苏联的驳船头尾都是方的呀！两只船接在一起当然能连成一个整体。我们的驳船是圆屁股、尖脑袋，两只船接在一起怎么能靠得牢呢。”“苏联的船上有联结器，有好些设备，还是机械或电气操作，我们的设备差。”“伏尔加河的航道比我们宽，水流比我们缓。”这些同志这时认为：过去试验失败的原因就在于长江航运的条件跟苏联不同。
    但是，别尔米亚科夫，这个曾经数次获得全苏社会主义竞赛优胜的“维辛斯基号”拖轮的船长，认为用长江现有的设备就可以编组三个驳船的“一列式”顶推船队。同时，只要学会了编组三个船的“一列式”顶推队形，再编其他队形就比较容易。
    为了使伏尔加河的先进经验同长江的具体情况结合起来，别尔米亚科夫特地去上游停泊区详细观察了一个船队编队的情况，具体了解了长江船体的构造和系缆的方法。他一直工作到深夜三点多钟还不休息；还要了绘图纸和三棱尺去，仔细地绘制了“一列式”顶推船队队形图。
    别尔米亚科夫亲自指挥试行“一列式顶推法”。这天，大家都很兴奋。“长江五○三”推轮上的船员们，一早就把船只打扫得干干净净，仔细地检查了船上的机器，老船长刘庆堂还特地穿上了袖口上绣有四道金边的船长制服，等待贵宾来传授这项先进经验。但是，由于过去数次试验的失败，有些人对于这个先进经验能否在长江上行得通还有疑问。
    雨一阵比一阵急。光滑的铁驳船都被淋得能照见人影。别尔米亚科夫仍然站在前面一艘驳船的船尾高处，要后面一艘驳船的旗杆、吊锚杆同前一艘船船尾的白灯对成一条直线。接着，他又和水手们一起把过去系的“单股人字缆”（一种系缆索的形式）改为系
  “双股交叉缆”，并且用铁棍穿到两股缆索中间，像扭麻花似的把缆索绞得紧紧的。他又到三艘船上去检查了一遍，用脚踏缆索，试试它绞紧没有。最后，他才回到推轮的操纵台上，准备开航。
    船刚开动，最前面的一艘驳船的缆索有些松动，整个船队不在一条直线上。大家正在耽心，可是，当前面的缆索继续绞紧后，船队就行动得像一只船一样了。
    五点三十分钟，长江上的第一个一列式”顶推船队向上游开航了。这个长达两百多公尺的船队，竟行驶得这样轻快，连舵工也感到比平日容易操舵。一会儿，它驶过了修理船坞，驶过了武汉关的钟楼，很清楚地看见长江大桥的八个桥墩工地。刘庆堂老船长也在心里估算行驶速度：大约每小时要比平日快一个半海里。当这个将近半里长的船队在江心掉转头，迅速地向下游驶去的时候，在岸边的“江新”、“民主”等大客轮上观看的海员们，都不禁挥手欢呼起来。接着船队又在下游掉过头来，驶回了停泊区。
    “一列式顶推法”在长江上试验成功了！事实解答了各种疑问。大家都激动得鼓掌欢呼，轮船也响了三声汽笛，向指导这次试验的苏联船长祝贺和致敬。“长江五○三”轮的船员们，把他们在最近举行的长江区第一次先进生产者代表会议上获得的奖旗，赠给了别尔米亚科夫同志。
    这时候，许多船员都诚恳地谈出了自己在这一个多钟头试航中的心情变化，保证在本单位推广这项先进经验。“长江五○三”轮的刘庆堂老船长也拍着胸口说：“要求上级调给两只两千吨的大驳船，我们负责在湾多航道窄的中游推行这个经验。”（附图片）
