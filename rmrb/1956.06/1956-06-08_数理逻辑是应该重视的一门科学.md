Mathematical logic (or symbolic logic), although a science with at least two hundred and several decades of history, has only recently rapidly developed into an important scientific field. Now, it is a discipline with very rich content, many connections with other scientific fields, and very broad development prospects. Its theoretical and practical, technical value is very great, and it has increasingly shown its importance in scientific research.

Before liberation, certain parts of mathematical logic were imported into our country mixed with the idealist philosophical ideas of logical positivism. Many people often confused mathematical logic as a science with idealist mathematical philosophy. Therefore, mathematical logic became the most misunderstood science in our country. The existence of this situation hindered its smooth development in our country and had a negative impact on scientific progress.

Mathematical logic stands between multiple sciences, extending its research objects into several sciences, thus forming its own independent problems and directions. Its object delves into departments such as cybernetics (especially the theory of electronic computers), mathematics, logic, linguistics, and philosophy, and establishes essential connections with them. We can confidently say that, with its development, it will reveal more important scientific principles and will have a profound impact on the theoretical and technical development of other aspects of science and technology.

Mathematical logic has an essential connection with automatic, high-speed electronic computers. The designer of an electronic computer is essentially designing a machine whose activities have some similarity to human thinking activities, and can replace certain thinking activities of the human brain while greatly exceeding the speed of human brain activity. (Of course, the human brain itself will never be completely replaced by machines.) How can we create such a machine? First, we need to abstract thinking quantitatively, discover its laws, and transform a certain thinking process into a calculation process, or a process with computational properties. For example, electronic computers can perform text translation. To enable machines to replace the human brain in translation, first, we should discover the rules of translation and transform the translation process into a calculation process, so that the machine can automatically perform translation according to the programmed instructions. (This issue is very complex, and we cannot provide a detailed explanation here.) Mathematical logic is the science that studies the laws of the thinking process from the quantitative aspect of thinking, and a central problem is to study the conversion of the thinking process into a calculation process. The research of mathematical logic tells us that by no means all thinking processes can be converted into calculation processes. Which processes can be converted into calculation processes, and how to convert them, are important issues in mathematical logic research. At the same time, the research of these issues is not only important for the theory of computers, but also of paramount importance for the design and use of computers.

The theories of computer analysis, synthesis, and logical design are based on mathematical logic. We know that to use digital computers to solve mathematical and logical problems is to design calculation programs suitable for computers. The computer is to perform calculations according to the programmed calculation procedures. Program design is the central issue in using digital computers. To improve the level of program design and develop a satisfactory theory of program design, it is only possible to use the achievements and methods of mathematical logic. Therefore, we can say that mathematical logic is the theoretical foundation of electronic computers.

We know that automatic machines are used in automated factories and automatic artillery devices in the military. The central part of the automatic machine is the automatic adjuster. The construction and activity process of the automatic adjuster are based on the technology of signal conversion. The automatic machine must change its actions according to changes in the situation; after the machine receives a signal of a change in the situation, the automatic adjuster automatically converts the received signal into a signal that causes the machine to change its action (i.e., adjustment), and mathematical logic is the theoretical basis of signal conversion technology.

The relationship between mathematical logic and mathematics is even more essential. Mathematical logic is particularly concerned with the fundamental problems and methodological issues in the development of mathematics. One of the reasons for the emergence and development of mathematical logic is the urgent needs in the development of mathematics. In mathematical logic, "proof theory," which takes mathematical proofs as its research object, has been developed. The results of proof theory are very surprising to mathematicians. For example, proof theory tells us that within any mathematical theory containing the concept of positive integers, there always exist mathematical propositions that are true but cannot be proven according to the generally used rules of formal logic. Proof theory also tells us that it is impossible to prove the consistency of a system itself using the logical tools within that mathematical system. Obviously, the discovery of these facts cannot but cause mathematicians to re-evaluate and consider the basic methods in mathematics, such as the method of logical proof and the axiomatic method. The discovery of these facts also refutes the idealist mathematical thought that all mathematics can be derived from a logical system (commonly known as logicism). Moreover, this fact is stated in the form of a rigorously proven theorem beyond any doubt.

Proof theory also provides new and powerful tools and methods for mathematical research with its rich content. For example, in the past, mathematicians often proved theorems one by one. Proof theory reveals the profound laws of mathematical proofs and provides a unified method for proving a collective of mathematical propositions all at once. Using the achievements and methods of mathematical logic, many achievements in mathematics can be unified and generalized, and theorems that were difficult to prove in the past can be proven. By applying the methods of mathematical logic, a difficult problem that mathematicians had been trying to solve unsuccessfully for more than 40 years (the "word problem" in algebra) has also been solved. It is believable that the research of mathematical logic will open a new chapter in the history of mathematical development.

Numerical calculations in classical mathematics belong to the scope of computational mathematics in modern mathematics, and the program design mentioned above also belongs to computational mathematics. Computational mathematics is a huge mathematical field that is rapidly developing under the development and requirements of calculation technology, especially the technology of high-speed digital electronic computers. Algorithm theory in mathematical logic has a special relationship with computational mathematics. It can be said that both take calculation as their research object, but the difference is that the former takes general calculation as its research object, while the latter is limited to special calculation. Computational mathematics will form its own unified theory on the basis of mathematical logic (especially algorithm theory) in its development. The formation of a unified theory of computational mathematics will greatly promote the development of mathematical science.

The relationship between mathematical logic and logic is also essential. Mathematical logic is a further improvement and development of classical formal logic. In mathematical logic, the development of the theory of inference technology has reached a high level that is incomparable to classical formal logic. We cannot imagine being able to make judgments about formal logic that meet modern scientific standards without mastering the basic content of mathematical logic. We also cannot imagine being able to implement Lenin's principled instructions on revising formal logic well while being ignorant of mathematical logic. Not only that, according to the principled regulations made by the classic works of Marxism-Leninism on the nature and content of dialectical logic, according to Engels's enlightenment on elementary mathematics and higher mathematics, and according to our understanding of the characteristics and content of mathematical logic, it can be determined that mathematical logic is not only important for formal logic, but also has a fundamental relationship with dialectical logic, and mathematical logic also contains rich content of dialectical logic.

The laws of dialectical logic are summarized from advanced thinking, especially the thinking and methodology in the research of various specific sciences. These laws reflect the essential determinacy and characteristics of advanced thinking, and mainly do not reflect the quantitative aspects of advanced thinking. Mathematical logic is to study the laws of thinking from the quantitative aspect, and it is possible to study the laws revealed by dialectical logic from the quantitative aspect and to express them precisely, and to prove them rigorously in the form of theorems. In this way, dialectical logic is preceding and guiding for mathematical logic, and mathematical logic is a further concretization of the principles of dialectical logic and a "preciseization" from the quantitative aspect. For example, according to the Marxist dialectical logic viewpoint, the effective scope of formal logic has its limitations. Mathematical logic states the effectiveness of formal logic within a certain range and the limitations to recognizing mathematical truths in the form of theorems, and gives a precise and rigorous proof. Mathematical logic includes rich content of dialectical logic; it can also provide important insights for the research of dialectical logic.

Mathematical logic also has an essential connection with linguistics. In mathematical logic, a symbolic system is used as the object of its research. This symbolic system is usually called logical calculus in mathematical logic. Just as teachers in medical schools need brain-made human body models to explain the internal organs of the human body to students, there should also be models of language in order to study certain characteristics of national languages. Logical calculus is a model of language; in logical calculus, there are so-called well-formed formulas, which are a model of sentences in language; these well-formed formulas are constructed according to certain rules, and their composition rules are models of the grammar of national languages, and so on. We know that models are not the original objects, and logical calculus is not a real language. Modern logical positivists think that logical calculus is language, which is naturally absurd. Logical calculus mainly reflects the logical characteristics of language. Since logical calculus and national languages have this relationship, it shows that the research of mathematical logic is of great significance for general linguistics, especially for the research of the logical characteristics of language.

The relationship between mathematical logic and philosophy is also very important, and the philosophical research of scientific materialism cannot but pay serious attention to this important science. The central problem of mathematical logic is to convert the thinking process into a calculation process, and the modern achievements of mathematical logic tell us that by no means all thinking processes can be converted into calculation processes, but with the development of mathematical logic, the scope that can be converted into calculation processes is expanding day by day. In a thinking process, such as in a reasoning process, if there is a section that can be converted into calculation, it means that this section of thinking can be simplified (with the help of computers, this section of thinking can even be realized with the help of machines), therefore, converting a thinking process into a calculation process means strengthening and improving human thinking ability. Therefore, mathematical logic in this sense is a science that improves human thinking ability, especially human reasoning ability. To reveal the regularity of thinking and to make philosophical explanations of thinking activities, the research of mathematical logic is indispensable. For philosophical explanations of basic concepts of natural science (such as "infinity," "continuity," etc.) and scientific methods (such as the axiomatic method), the research of mathematical logic is also indispensable. Obviously, its methodological significance is huge.

Just as Machists distorted the latest achievements of physics, various reactionary logical positivists used and distorted important achievements in mathematical logic to establish their idealist philosophical system. To correctly summarize the achievements of this science philosophically, to estimate its significance, and to criticize idealist ideas is one of the most important tasks of contemporary Marxists-Leninists.

Modern idealist mathematical philosophy has several schools, such as logicism, formalism, and intuitionism. These idealist representatives such as Russell, Whitehead, Quine, Hilbert, Bernays, Brouwer, Heyting, etc., have made some contributions to mathematical logic. They have a common characteristic, that is, they have done some scientific research and reached some correct scientific conclusions. They themselves thought that these conclusions could support their reactionary idealist philosophical ideas. In fact, their attempts are futile, they are just distorting their scientific results idealistically. We should deeply criticize the idealism in their works and leave the scientific content in their works. Throwing out the dirty water in the basin and leaving the child. The result of the "simple negation" of idealist mathematical philosophy will lead to the abandonment of certain important philosophical positions of Marxism-Leninism, which is very harmful. We should conduct in-depth and detailed criticism of logicism, formalism, and intuitionism, which is very important for criticizing modern idealist ideas, defending Marxist philosophy, and also has great positive significance for the healthy development of mathematical logic.

The above is a simple explanation of the relationship between mathematical logic and other sciences. This explanation is extremely incomplete. Obviously, the importance of mathematical logic is determined by its own research objects and properties, and not only because it is useful to other sciences. Because it is such a science, it enables the science of thinking and human thinking ability to be raised to a level that predecessors could not have dreamed of. It is inevitable that it is useful, and there are also broad possibilities in other aspects.

The great scientific significance of mathematical logic lies in the fact that it provides all scientific departments with an incomparably powerful weapon of thinking technology and thinking technology theory. Just as microscopes and telescopes have opened up new landscapes and directions for biology and astronomy, mathematical logic will also open up new directions and paths for all departments of science, and open up new fields for the entire science.

Because mathematical logic will generate a great driving force in scientific development, and because of the profoundness and breadth of the connection between this science and other scientific fields, this science should attract close and widespread attention from the scientific community. We should vigorously support its development, change the current situation of weak strength in this area in our country, and gradually establish a foundation so that we can launch large-scale research work; otherwise, we will not be able to meet the needs of our great construction cause, and it will bring losses to scientific development.

    数理逻辑是应该重视的一门科学
    中国科学院数学研究所研究员  胡世华
    数理逻辑（或称符号逻辑）虽然是一门至少已经有二百几十年历史的科学，可是迅速发展成为一门重要的科学部门还是晚近的事情。现在，它已经是一门内容十分丰富、与其他科学部门联系很多的、有十分宽广的发展前途的学科。它的理论与实际的、技术的价值是很大的，它已经日益显示出它在科学研究中的重要性。
    解放以前，数理逻辑的某些部分和逻辑实证论的唯心主义哲学思想混在一起被输入我国。许多人往往把数理逻辑这一门科学与唯心主义的数理哲学混为一谈，因此，数理逻辑在我国就成为最被误解的一门科学了。这一种情况的存在，阻碍了它在我国的顺利发展，对于科学的进步起了不良影响。
    数理逻辑是处于多门科学之间的，它把它的研究对象伸入到好几门科学中去，而形成自己独立的问题与方向。它的对象深入到控制论（特别是电子计算机的理论）、数学、逻辑学、语言学、哲学等部门，而与之发生本质的联系。我们可以肯定地说，随着它的发展，它将更多揭露出重要的科学原理，对于其他方面的科学和技术发展将在理论上、技术上给以深刻的影响。
    数理逻辑和自动快速电子计算机有本质的联系。电子计算机的设计者实质上就是要设计出一种机器，这种机器的活动要和人的思维活动有某种相似之处，要能够代替人脑的某种思维活动而速度又要大大超过人脑活动。（当然，人脑本身是永远也不会被机器所完全代替的。）我们如何能够制造出这样的机器来呢？首先，我们要对思维作量的抽象，发现其规律，并把某种思维过程转换成为一种计算的过程，或带有计算性质的过程。举例来说：电子计算机能够进行文字翻译。要使机器代替人脑进行翻译，首先，我们应发现翻译的规律并把翻译过程转换为计算过程，以便使机器能够按照编好的程序自动地进行翻译。（这个问题很复杂，我们无法在这里作详细的说明。）数理逻辑就是从思维的量的侧面去研究思维过程的规律的科学，它的一个中心问题就是研究把思维过程转换为计算过程。数理逻辑的研究告诉我们，远不是所有的思维过程都有可能转换为计算过程的。哪些过程能够转换成计算过程，以及如何转换，这些问题正是数理逻辑研究中的重要问题。同时，这些问题的研究不单是对于计算机的理论是重要的，对于计算机的设计与使用也是头等重要的。
    计算机的分析、综合及逻辑设计的理论是建立在数理逻辑的基础上的。我们知道，要利用数字计算机来解决数学的和逻辑的问题就是要设计出适用于计算机的计算程序。计算机是要按照编好的计算程序来进行计算的。程序设计是运用数字计算机的中心问题。要提高程序设计的水平，发展出一个满意的程序设计的理论，只有利用数理逻辑的成果与方法才有可能。因此，我们可以说，数理逻辑是电子计算机的理论基础。
    我们知道，自动化工厂，军事上的自动炮火装置中都用自动机器。自动机器的中心部分是自动调整器。自动调整器的构造与活动过程的掌握是建立在讯号转换的技术之上的。自动机器要根据情况的变化来改变自己的动作；机器在接受到情况改变的讯号后，由自动调整器把接受到的讯号自动地转换为使机器改变动作（即调整）的讯号，而数理逻辑就是讯号转换技术的理论基础。
    数理逻辑与数学的关系是更为本质的。数理逻辑特别关心数学发展中的带有根本性的问题和方法论的问题。数理逻辑的产生和发展的原因之一是数学发展中的迫切需要。在数理逻辑中发展了以数学证明为其研究对象的“证明论”。证明论的结果是很令数学家惊讶的。例如，证明论告诉我们：任何包含正整数概念的数学理论之中总存在着按照一般习用的形式逻辑规律所不能证明、然而是真的数学命题。证明论又告诉我们：使用某一个数学系统中的逻辑工具是不可能证明这系统本身的一贯性的。显然，这种事实的发现不能不使数学家去对数学中的基本方法，如逻辑证明的方法，公理学方法给以重新的估计和考虑。这种事实的发现，也使得那种以为可以把全部数学从一个逻辑系统中推导出来的（通常称为逻辑主义）唯心主义数学思想被驳倒了。而且，这个事实是用无可置疑地严格地被证明的定理的形式来陈述的。
    证明论也以其丰富的内容，提供数学研究以新的强有力的工具和方法。例如，过去数学家在证明定理时往往是一条一条的证明的，在证明论中揭露了数学证明的深刻的规律，提供了对某一个集体的数学命题的统一的，一齐证明的方法。利用数理逻辑的成果和方法可以把许多数学中的成果统一起来并加以推广，并证明了过去所不易证明的定理。运用了数理逻辑的方法，也曾解决了数学家企图解决而未能成功达四十多年之久的困难问题（代数学中的“字的问题”）。可以相信，数理逻辑的研究将揭开数学发展历史的崭新的一页。
    古典数学中的数值计算属于现代数学中的计算数学的范围，上面讲到的程序设计也属于计算数学。计算数学是在计算技术、特别是快速数字电子计算机的技术的发展和要求下迅速发展的巨大的数学部门。数理逻辑中的算法论和计算数学有其特殊的关系，可以说两者都是以计算为其研究对象的，所不同的在于前者是以一般的计算为其研究对象，而后者则限于以特殊的计算为其研究对象。计算数学在其发展中将在数理逻辑（特别是算法论）的基础上形成自己的统一的理论。计算数学的统一的理论的形成将大大推进数学科学的发展。
    数理逻辑与逻辑学的关系也是本质的。数理逻辑是古典的形式逻辑的进一步的完善和发展。在数理逻辑中，推论技术的理论的发展较之古典形式逻辑来已达到不可同日而语的高的水平。我们不能设想，不掌握数理逻辑的基本内容，却能够作出关于形式逻辑的合乎现代科学水平的论断来。我们同样不能设想，在对于数理逻辑是无知的情况下，却能很好地执行列宁的关于把形式逻辑加以修正的原则性的指示。不仅如此，根据马克思列宁主义的经典著作对于辩证逻辑的性质与内容所作的原则性的规定，根据恩格斯对于初等数学和高等数学的论断的启示，根据我们所理解的数理逻辑的特点和内容，可以断定，数理逻辑不止是对于形式逻辑是重要的，而且和辩证逻辑有根本的关系，在数理逻辑中也包含着丰富的辩证逻辑的内容。
    辩证逻辑的规律是从高级思维特别是各门具体科学研究中的思维及其方法论中总结出来的，这种规律是反映高级思维的本质的规定性和特征的，这种规律主要不是反映高级思维的量的侧面的。数理逻辑是要从量的侧面来对思维规律进行研究，对于辩证逻辑所揭露出来的规律有可能从量的侧面来进行研究并予以精确地陈述、以定理的形式严格地予以证明。这样，辩证逻辑对于数理逻辑来说是先行的而且是有指导性的，而数理逻辑是辩证逻辑的原则的进一步具体化与从量的侧面来说的“精确化”。例如，根据马克思主义的辩证逻辑的观点，形式逻辑的有效范围是有其局限性的。数理逻辑以定理的形式来陈述形式逻辑在一定范围内的有效性与对于认识数学真理的局限性，并予以精确严格的证明。数理逻辑中包括丰富的辩证逻辑的内容；它对于辩证逻辑的研究也能够提供重要的启示。
    数理逻辑与语言学也有本质的联系。在数理逻辑中要以一种符号体系作为自己研究的对象，这种符号体系在数理逻辑中通常称为逻辑演算。正像医学院的教师为了向学生说明人体内脏部位要有脑制的人体模型一样，为了研究民族语言的某种特点也应有语言的模型。逻辑演算就是一种语言的模型；在逻辑演算中有所谓合适的公式，它就是语言中的语句的一种模型；这种合适的公式是按照一定的规则构造起来的，它的构成规则就是民族语言的语法的模型，等等。我们知道，模型不是原物，逻辑演算也不是真正的语言。现代逻辑实证主义者却以为逻辑演算就是语言，这自然是荒谬的。逻辑演算主要是反映语言的逻辑特点的。逻辑演算与民族语言既然有这种关系，这就说明了数理逻辑的研究对于一般语言学，特别是对于语言的逻辑特点的研究有着很大的意义。
    数理逻辑与哲学的关系也是很重要的，科学唯物主义的哲学研究，是不能不对这一门重要科学予以严肃的注意的。数理逻辑的中心问题即是把思维过程转换为计算过程，数理逻辑的现代成果告诉我们，远不是一切思维过程都能够转换为计算过程的，可是随着数理逻辑的发展，这种能够转换为计算过程的范围就在日益扩大着。在一个思维过程中，例如在一个推理过程中，如果其中有一段是可以转化为计算的，那就是说可以把这一段的思维简化了
  （有了计算机甚至可以用机器的帮助来实现这段思维），因之，一种思维过程转换成计算过程意味着人的思维能力的加强和提高。所以，数理逻辑在这样的意义上，是一种提高人类思维能力，特别是提高人类推理能力的科学。揭示思维的规律性、对于思维活动作哲学上的说明，数理逻辑的研究是不可少的。对于自然科学的基本概念（如“无穷”，“连续”等）和科学方法（如公理方法）作哲学上的说明，数理逻辑的研究也是不可少的。显然，它的方法论的意义是很巨大的。
    正和马赫主义者歪曲物理学的最新成果相似，各式各样的反动的逻辑实证主义者利用和歪曲数理逻辑中的重要成果而建立起他们的唯心主义的哲学体系。从哲学上正确地总结这一门科学的成果，估计到它的意义，批判唯心主义的思想，这是当代的马克思列宁主义者的最为重要的任务之一。
    现代唯心主义的数理哲学有好几个流派，如逻辑主义，形式主义及直觉主义。这些唯心主义的代表人物如罗素，怀德海，蒯因，希尔伯，贝纳斯，布劳维，海丁等人对数理逻辑有过若干贡献。他们有一个共同的特点，即他们作了一些科学研究，得出一些正确的科学的结论，他们自己以为这些结论可以支持他们的反动的唯心主义的哲学思想。实际上他们的企图是徒劳的，他们不过是把他们的科学的结果进行了唯心主义的歪曲。我们应当对他们的著作中的唯心主义进行深刻的批判，留下他们著作中的科学内容。把盆中的污水泼去，留下小孩子。对于唯心主义的数理哲学的
  “简单的否定”的结果，会导致马克思列宁主义的某些重要的哲学阵地的放弃，这是十分有害的。我们应该对于逻辑主义，形式主义和直觉主义进行深入细致的批判，这对于批判现代唯心主义思想，保卫马克思主义哲学是十分重要的工作，对于数理逻辑的健康发展也有很大的积极意义。
    上面对于数理逻辑与其它科学的关系作了一些简单说明。这种说明是极其不完备的。显然，数理逻辑的重要性决定于它本身的研究对象与性质，并不只是由于它对其它科学有些用处。由于它是这样一门科学，它使得思维科学和人类思维能力提高到前人所未能梦想的水平，有用处乃是必然的，而且还存在着其他方面的宽广的可能性。
    数理逻辑的巨大的科学意义在于它对各个科学部门提供了无比强大的思维技术与思维技术理论的武器。正像显微镜与望远镜开辟了生物学与天文学的新的景观和方向，数理逻辑也将为科学的各个部门开辟新的方向和道路，为整个科学开辟新的领域。
    由于数理逻辑在科学发展中将产生伟大的推动力量，由于这一门科学与其他科学领域的联系的深刻性与广泛性，这一门科学应引起科学界密切和广泛的注意。我们应大力支持它的发展，改变我国在这方面力量薄弱的现状，逐步建立基础，使我们能够展开规模巨大的研究工作；否则就将不能满足我们伟大的建设事业的需要，就会给科学发展带来损失。
