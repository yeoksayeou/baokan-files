    Outdated and Immoral...
    Jin Feng

    Recently, three of the highest-ranking officials in the U.S. government—President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, and Secretary of State Dulles—have all expressed opinions on the issue of neutrality.

    On June 6th, Eisenhower spoke about neutrality at a press conference, saying:

    “We were also a young country once, and our entire policy for the first hundred, or even a little more, a hundred and fifty years, was to maintain neutrality. We often declared that we were neutral in world wars, in European wars, and in hostilities.

    Now, some countries say they are neutral… they are using the term neutrality in terms of whether or not to participate in military alliances. And I would like to point out that I don't think this approach is always unfavorable to a country like ours…”

    The U.S. President’s remarks acknowledged that the policy of peaceful neutrality pursued by many countries is reasonable and in line with their national interests, which greatly surprised those who had made great sacrifices to follow the U.S.'s military bloc policy. According to Reuters, "representatives of countries that joined the Manila Treaty with the United States were uneasy." Some officials in Australia and New Zealand were also uneasy. They believe that the U.S. President's remarks show that the United States will treat them the same as neutral countries, and they have made "sacrifices" in order to form an alliance with the United States.

    Therefore, the next afternoon, Dulles hurried to the White House to have a "lengthy discussion" with Eisenhower.

    That day (June 7th), the White House issued a statement authorized by the President, which stated: "The President does believe that there are some special circumstances that justify political neutrality," but he "does not believe that uniting with the United States to seek common security will cause any country further danger, but on the contrary, it will… provide further security." That is to say, neutrality is certainly correct, but those who participate in the U.S.'s military blocs need not regret the sacrifices they have made.

    Then, that evening, Vice President Nixon came out to explain why the United States cannot tolerate the existence of neutral countries. This explanation was very convincing. Nixon admitted that this is because, in the current international situation, "countries that have not undertaken obligations will not ally with the West due to the threat of military force, nor can their loyalty be bought with U.S. dollars." Therefore, in order to keep these countries under U.S. influence and control, the United States must place more emphasis on plans to "win the hearts and minds" of these countries, and treat them with "missionary ingenuity, humility, and friendliness."

    Dulles, who is known for his enthusiasm, immediately let neutral countries experience this so-called "ingenuity, humility, and friendliness" from the United States. When he delivered a speech to the graduating class of Iowa State University on June 9th, he said that neutrality "has increasingly become an obsolete concept, and unless in very exceptional circumstances, it is an immoral and short-sighted concept."

    Of course, few people with self-respect can tolerate Dulles's "ingenious," "humble," and "friendly" declaration. No wonder the "Indian Times" refuted his remarks, saying: "Joining military alliances does not require the appreciation of the United States, but to describe not joining military alliances as 'immoral' must be opposed."

    In history, Dulles is not the first person to violently attack neutral countries. The most famous predecessors Dulles can cite as comrades are Napoleon and Hitler. When Napoleon began to piece together his world empire, he first declared that in this empire there cannot and should not be "neutralists." Hitler said more bluntly: "I will forge the core of a new empire, this empire will be indestructible... there will be no more neutralists. The fate of neutral countries is to be partners of great powers. They will be annexed."

    But historical facts have proved that it was not the neutral countries but the empires of Napoleon and Hitler that collapsed. And now, despite Dulles wielding his big stick and checkbook, neutralism is becoming more and more popular. And the military alliances cobbled together by the United States are becoming more and more unpopular.

    Even so, Dulles still wants to hold on to his military alliance. Eisenhower had just admitted the reality that the United States could not change, and Dulles immediately came out to deny it. This obvious contradiction and confusion reflects the current dilemma of U.S. foreign policy. But Dulles is actually just overreaching. American commentator Lippmann could not help but rebuke:

    "Mr. Dulles should know that his all-encompassing moral judgments will not win him allies but will only alienate many friends." And the course of history has also proved that "outdated" and "immoral" are definitely not neutralism but the "power politics" that Dulles still refuses to abandon.

### 陈旧的和不道德的……

    陈旧的和不道德的……
    金凤
    最近，美国政府的三位最高级官员——总统艾森豪威尔、副总统尼克松和国务卿杜勒斯，都对中立问题发表了意见。
    六月六日，艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上这样地谈到了中立，他说：
    “我们曾经也是一个年轻的国家，我们在头一百年或者是更多一点一百五十年中的整个政策，是守中立的。我们经常声言我们是在世界战争中，在欧洲战争中和敌对中守中立的。
    现在有某些国家说它们是中立的……它们是在参加不参加军事联盟这一方面使用中立这个说法的。而我想指出，我不认为这种做法对于像我们这样的国家总是不利的……”
    美国总统的这番话，承认了目前许多国家奉行和平中立的政策是有道理的，是符合于它们国家的利益的，这就使那些蒙受了极大的牺牲来追随美国的军事集团政策的人大吃了一惊。据路透社报道，“同美国一道参加马尼拉条约的国家的代表感到不安”。不安的还有澳大利亚、新西兰的某些官员。他们认为美国总统的谈话显示了美国将把他们和中立国家同等看待，而他们为了和美国结成同盟是作出了“牺牲”的。
    于是，在第二天下午，杜勒斯匆匆赶到白宫去，和艾森豪威尔“进行了长时间的讨论”。
    当天（六月七日），白宫发表了总统授权的声明，声明中说：“总统的确认为有些特殊的情况证明政治上的中立是正确的”，但是，他“并不认为同美国联合起来谋求共同安全会为任何国家招致进一步的危险，但是恰恰相反，那将……提供进一步的安全。”这就是说，中立固然是正确的，可是参加美国的军事集团的，似乎也不必惋惜它们所作的牺牲。
    接着，就在这一天晚上，副总统尼克松出来说明了为什么美国不能不容忍中立国家的存在。这个说明是很有说服力的。尼克松承认，这是因为，在目前的国际局势下面，“未承担义务的国家是不会因军事力量的恐吓而和西方结盟，也不能以美元收买它们的忠诚”的了。因此，要使这些国家处于美国的影响和控制之下，美国必须更加侧重在这些国家中“争取人心”的计划，用“传教士的机智、谦虚和友好态度”来对待它们。
    素以热心出名的杜勒斯马上就让中立国家领教了美国的这种所谓“机智、谦虚和友好”的态度。他于六月九日在衣阿华州立大学的毕业班上发表演说的时候说，中立“已经日益成为一种陈旧的概念，除非在非常特殊的情况下，它是一种不道德的和目光短浅的概念。”
    当然，有自尊心的人很少能够忍受杜勒斯这种“机智”、“谦虚”而又“友好”的表白。难怪“印度时报”要驳斥他的谈话说：“不参加军事同盟并不需要美国的赞赏，但是把不参加军事同盟说成是‘不道德’，就一定要反对。”
    在历史上，狂暴地攻击中立国家的，杜勒斯并不是第一个人。杜勒斯可以引为同道的最著名的先辈就有拿破仑和希特勒。当拿破仑开始拼凑他的世界帝国的时候，他首先就宣布说，在这个帝国里不能够也不应该有“中立者”。希特勒更露骨地说过：“我将锻炼出新帝国的核心，这个帝国将是不可摧毁的……不再会有中立者。中立国家的命运就是做大国的伙伴。他们将被并吞。”
    可是历史的事实却证明，崩溃的不是中立国家而是拿破仑和希特勒的帝国。而在现在，尽管杜勒斯挥动他的大棒和支票本子，中立主义却愈来愈深入人心了。而美国所拼凑的军事联盟却愈来愈不得人心。
    虽然如此，杜勒斯却还是想捧住他的军事联盟不放。艾森豪威尔刚刚承认美国无法改变的现实，杜勒斯马上就出来加以否认。这种明显的矛盾和混乱，反映了美国外交政策目前进退两难的处境。但是杜勒斯实际上不过是弄巧成拙。美国评论员李普曼禁不住责备说：
  “杜勒斯先生应该知道，他的无所不包的道义的判断不会使他赢得盟友而只能使许多朋友疏远。”而历史的进程也已经证明：“陈旧”和“不道德的”绝不是中立主义而是杜勒斯至今还不肯放弃的“实力政策”。
