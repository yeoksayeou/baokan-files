Xinhua News Agency, June 16th -- According to a United Press International report from Singapore on June 15th: All political parties in Singapore unanimously believe that they should unite as a backing force for the struggle for independence before reopening independence negotiations with Britain.
    Both right-wing and left-wing parties have assured the new Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock that they will help him establish a united front and will support his proposal to hold a joint conference of all parties to reconcile political differences.
    These party leaders emphasized that Britain will only comply with "the Singaporean people's desire for independence" when faced with a united front.

    新加坡各党派将联合起来争取独立
    新华社16日讯　据合众社新加坡十五日消息：新加坡所有政党一致认为，它们在和英国重开独立谈判以前应该联合起来作为争取独立的后盾。
    右翼和左翼政党都向新任首席部长林有福保证，它们将帮助他成立一个联合阵线，并且将支持他提出的举行各党派联合会议来调整政治分歧的建议。
    这些政党领袖着重指出，英国只有在面临一个联合阵线的时候，才会顺从“新加坡人民要求独立的愿望”。
