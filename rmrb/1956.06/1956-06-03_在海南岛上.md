　　Hainan Island is a good place; people call her the "Treasure Island of the Motherland."

　　Hainan Island is located in the southern part of our country. The island has a land area of 33,566 square kilometers and a population of 2.77 million. The climate on the island is like spring all year round, and plants can grow perennially. In addition to being suitable for planting a wide variety of tropical and subtropical cash crops, this beautiful place also contains rich mineral resources.

　　Since the liberation of Hainan Island in 1950, the people of Hainan have united and actively carried out economic construction work under the leadership of the Party for several years. The Hainan Iron Mine was put into production in 1953, and new sugar factories and vegetable oil factories have also been built successively. At present, more than 80% of farmers on the island have joined cooperatives.

　　In order to vigorously develop the valuable subtropical resources of the motherland, the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has made a comprehensive plan for the development and construction of Hainan Island. According to this plan, a large number of tropical and subtropical cash crops such as rubber, coconut, sisal, sea island cotton, pepper, citronella, coffee, betel nut, oil palm, sugar cane, pineapple, etc. will be planted in Hainan Island in the future. Some factories, mines, and processing plants for agricultural products and cash crops will also be built. Hainan Island will contribute its due strength to the socialist industrialization construction of the motherland. (Attached pictures)

    在海南岛上
    海南岛是一个好地方，人们把她叫做“祖国的宝岛”。
    海南岛地处我国的南部，全岛的土地面积有三万三千五百六十六平方公里，人口有二百七十七万。岛上的气候四季如春，植物能够常年生长。在这块美好的地方除了适宜种植多种多样的热带和亚热带经济作物外，还蕴藏着丰富的矿产。
    1950年海南岛解放后，几年来海南人民在党的领导下，团结一致，积极进行经济建设工作。海南铁矿在1953年已经投入生产，新的糖厂和植物油厂也相继建设起来了。现在，全岛农户的80％以上已经参加了合作社。
    为了大力开发祖国这块宝贵的亚热带地区的资源，中共海南区党委已经作出了开发和建设海南岛的全面规划。按照这个规划，今后将要在海南岛大量种植各种热带和亚热带经济作物，如橡胶、椰子、剑麻、海岛棉、胡椒、香茅草、咖啡、槟榔、油棕、甘蔗、菠萝……还要修建一些工厂、矿场和农产品及经济作物的加工厂。海南岛将在祖国社会主义工业化建设中贡献出她应尽的力量。（附图片）
