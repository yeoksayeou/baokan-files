Gorky is Teaching Us
——Commemorating the Twentieth Anniversary of Gorky's Death
Cao Jinghua

In 1895, Gorky said in "The Song of the Falcon": "In the praise of the brave and the spiritually heroic, you are forever a living model, a proud call to freedom and light!"

This statement is extremely appropriate for praising the author. He is forever our "living model," a "proud call to freedom and light." The author's life itself is a great work that is extremely rich, touching, and full of revolutionary fighting spirit.

For decades, Gorky's influence on Chinese readers has been profound and multifaceted. In 1932, Lu Xun, in his article "A Toast to the Exchange Between Chinese and Russian Writing," mentioned that about forty years earlier, in the dark era, some of our young people already "felt oppressed, only pain, he wanted to struggle, ... only seeking concrete instructions." Lu Xun pointed out: "At that time, we saw Russian literature. At that time, we knew that Russian literature was our teacher and friend. Because from it, we saw the kind souls of the oppressed, their bitterness, their struggles; and with the works of the 1840s, we ignited hope, and with the works of the 1860s, we felt sadness. How could we not know that the Great Russian Empire was also invading China at that time, but from literature, we understood a major thing, that there are two kinds of people in the world: oppressors and the oppressed! From today's perspective, this is clear to everyone, nothing special; but at that time, it was a great discovery, no less than the ancients' discovery of fire that could illuminate the dark night and cook things."

The great Russian writers, with bright ideals and deep sympathy, truthfully and powerfully poured out the grievances of the Russian people who were in a position of humiliation and suffering, expressed their anger and resistance to the oppressors, and ignited their flame of longing for freedom and light. Such literature was precisely the "fire to illuminate the dark night" that the Chinese people, who were in deep suffering, had longed for. It is not accidental that Russian literature became our "teacher and friend." For decades, the influence of Russian and Soviet literature in China has been greater than the influence of literature from any other era or country. And the most influential Russian and Soviet writer on Chinese readers is Gorky.

Let's listen to what some people from the May Fourth era had to say. The writer Feng Xuefeng mentioned that when he first read Gorky's works, he was young and deeply moved, "gaining a kind of passion for pursuing the 'beauty' of mankind and the power of the oppressed to resist the oppressors." (See the 1947 "Gorky Research Annual") The writer Ba Jin, when talking about how he translated "A Story of the Steppe," said that at that time, "living in this narrow cage, I longed for the vast grasslands, tall forests, and the freedom that is more precious than life. But the darkness of reality destroyed all of this..." (Ibid.) At that time, most Chinese youth, like them, were in an environment where they could not breathe, seeing the Russian "proletarian revolutionary petrel" soaring like lightning in our gloomy and dark sky, hearing the battle signal that "the storm" was about to come. His "proud call to freedom and light" deeply stirred the hearts of a generation of Chinese youth who longed for freedom and light. The outstanding sons and daughters of China's May Fourth generation, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, stood in the ranks of fighting for the liberation of the Chinese people with the vigorous posture of the eagle praised by Gorky, and fought to overthrow the oppressors.

For decades, in the dramatic changes of Chinese society, countless outstanding intellectuals have been inspired, encouraged, and empowered by Gorky's works, and have embarked on the road of revolution. These vivid examples are too numerous to mention.

Xia Yan, the translator of "Mother," mentioned more than a decade ago that Gorky's "My Universities" and other works had a great impact on this "self-admiring," "bookish scion" from feudal society, in the "self-struggle" and "ruthlessly cutting down his own past," to embark on the road of "everything for the people," in "abandoning all identities, thoughts, habits, and aesthetic concepts that isolate oneself from the people." (Ibid.) Is this only true of Xia Yan alone?

Qu Qiubai said: "Gorky's books are books that awaken us, such books must 'teach us how to live tomorrow.'" Before liberation, a poet who grew up in the old society, at one time, when he was in a state of extreme contradiction and distress in his thoughts and feelings, read Gorky's "The Life of Klim Samgin," which could not help but make him sweat. He realized that he might follow in Samgin's footsteps. It was precisely because of Gorky's guidance that he did not fall into Samgin's mire.

Guo Moruo, when talking about Gorky's influence on Chinese writers, said: "It is directly beyond literature. He is respected, loved, and followed by Chinese writers; his life is endowed with divinity, and his works are regarded as 'sacred books,' especially his literary theories, which have no less influence on China than in the Soviet Union itself. The lifestyle and creative process of literary and art workers are universally and deeply influenced by his instructions. Through this, we can not only know how to create or what to create, but also learn how to live or become a kind of person."

Precisely because Gorky gave Chinese readers such a profound influence, in the reactionary era, Gorky's works were particularly hated and strictly forbidden by the reactionary rulers in China. After the First Revolutionary Civil War, "Mother" in China was not only listed as a banned book, but "many young people were persecuted by the more brutal reactionaries than the Tsar simply for loving to read this book." (Xia Yan: "The Fate of 'Mother' in China") In the summer of 1932, an international friend who ran a magazine in Shanghai intended to print some literary works in addition to publishing regular magazines. He asked Lu Xun for manuscripts, and Lu Xun gave him the Chinese translation of Gorky's "January 9th" published in Moscow that I had sent him from the Soviet Union, and wrote a short preface, but the Chinese "January 9th," which had been kept in Lu Xun's hands for a long time, had no chance to meet Chinese readers and was confiscated in the printing factory. For a long time, Chinese readers could only see Lu Xun's "Supplement to Essays from Outside the Collection" with the "Preface to January 9th." In the reactionary era, countless people were monitored and lost their freedom for reading Gorky's works.

Exactly twenty years ago, when Gorky passed away, the cultural circles in Peiping searched high and low and could not find a venue for a memorial service. They had to borrow the auditorium of a church school outside the city for the meeting. This is the small auditorium on the current office building of Peking University. At that time, because transportation was difficult, groups of young people braved the scorching heat and disregarded persecution, walking from the city to attend the memorial service! As Xia Yan said when talking about the long-term oppression of the Chinese translation of "Mother" in the reactionary period in China: It is absolutely impossible to remove the influence of this book from the hearts of Chinese youth. "It has inspired us Chinese people, it has become an inseparable part of the flesh and blood and soul of the Chinese people." Gorky's entire works and his entire spirit have become an inseparable whole with the fighting Chinese people.

    高尔基在教导着我们
    ——纪念高尔基逝世二十周年
    曹靖华
    1895年，高尔基在“鹰之歌”里说：“在勇敢者和精神雄壮者的歌颂里，你永远是活的模范、向自由、向光明的高傲的号召！”
    这话用于歌颂作者，是极恰当的。他永远是我们的“活的模范”；是“向自由、向光明的高傲的号召”。作者一生的生活本身，就是一部极丰富、感人，充满着革命战斗精神的伟大作品。
    几十年来，高尔基对中国读者的影响是极深刻而且是多方面的。1932年鲁迅在“祝中俄文字之交”一文中，谈到约在四十年前的黑暗时代里，我们一部分的青年已经“觉得压迫、只有痛楚，他要挣扎，……只在寻切实的指示了”。鲁迅指出：“那时就看见了俄国文学。那时就知道了俄国文学是我们的导师和朋友。因为从那里面，看见了被压迫者的善良的灵魂，的辛酸、的挣扎；还和四十年代的作品一同烧起希望，和六十年代的作品一同感到悲哀。我们岂不知道那时的大俄罗斯帝国也正在侵略中国，然而从文学里明白了一件大事，是世界上有两种人：压迫者和被压迫者！从现在看来，这是谁都明白，不足道的；但在那时，却是一个大发见，正不亚于古人的发见了火的可以照暗夜，煮东西。”
    怀着光明理想和深厚同情的伟大俄罗斯作家，真实有力地倾吐了处在屈辱苦难地位的俄罗斯人民的苦衷，表达了他们对压迫者的愤怒和反抗，燃起了他们渴望自由、光明的火焰。这样的文学，正是已往处在灾难深重中的中国人民所梦寐以求的“照暗夜的火”。俄罗斯文学成了我们的“导师和朋友”，并不是偶然的事。几十年来，俄罗斯和苏联文学在中国影响之大，为任何时代，任何国家的文学影响所不及。而俄罗斯和苏联文学对中国读者影响最大的，莫过于高尔基。
    我们不妨听听“五四”时代一些人们的话吧。作家冯雪峰谈到他最初读到高尔基的作品，那时还年青，就受到深刻的感动，“得到一种对人类的‘美’的追求的热情和被压迫者对压迫者的反抗的力量。”（见1947年“高尔基研究年刊”）作家巴金在谈到他怎样译“草原的故事”的时候，说他当时“生活在这窄狭的笼中，我渴望着广阔的草原，高大的树林，以及那比生命还要宝贵的自由。然而现实的黑暗，给我摧毁了这一切。……”（同上）当时大多数中国青年，同他们一样地处在窒息得不能喘气的环境里，看见了俄罗斯“无产阶级革命的海燕”，闪电似的在我们的阴沉、灰暗的天空里飞翔，听见了“暴风雨”将要来到的战斗信号。他的“向自由、向光明的高傲的号召”，深深地激动了中国一代青年的渴望自由、光明的心。中国“五四”一代的优秀儿女，在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，以高尔基所歌颂的鹰的雄健姿态，站到为中国人民解放而斗争的战斗的行列里，为推倒压迫者而进行了斗争。
    几十年来，在中国社会的剧变中，无数的优秀知识分子，曾从高尔基作品中得到过启示、鼓舞和力量，走到革命道路上来，这生动的实例，也是举不胜举的。
    “母亲”的译者夏衍，在十多年前，曾谈到高尔基的“我的大学”以及其他作品，曾对这“孤芳自赏”，出身封建社会的“书香子弟”，在“自我斗争”和“残忍地砍伐自己的过去”，走到“一切为人民”的道路上来，在“抛弃自己和人民隔离的一切身份上、思想上、习癖上、审美观念上的‘包袱’”，（同上）是起了极大作用的。这岂止夏衍一人如此？
    瞿秋白说过：“高尔基的书是惊醒我们的书，这样的书要‘教会我们明天怎样去生活。’”解放以前，有一位在旧社会成长的诗人，有一个时期，正当他在思想、情感上处在极为矛盾、苦恼的时候，读了高尔基的“克里·萨木金的一生”，不禁使他捏了一把冷汗，他恍悟到自己有可能步萨木金的后尘。正是由于高尔基的指导，没有使他陷入萨木金的泥坑里。
    郭沫若谈到高尔基对中国作家的影响说：“径直是超文学的。他被中国的作家们崇敬、爱慕、追随；他的生活被赋与了神性，他的作品被视为了‘圣经’，尤其是他的文学论，对于中国的影响是决不亚于在苏联本国。文艺工作者的生活态度和创作过程，普遍而深切地受着了指示。我们借此不仅可以知道应该如何去创作或创作些什么，而且还学习了应该如何生活或成为一个怎样的人。”
    正因为高尔基给中国读者这种极深刻的影响，在反动时代，高尔基的作品，在中国也就遭到反动统治者的特别仇视和严禁。第一次国内革命战争以后，“母亲”在中国不但被列为禁书，而且不知“有多少青年单单为了爱读这本书而遭遇到比沙皇更残暴的反动派的迫害。”（夏衍：“‘母亲’在中国的命运”）1932年夏，有一位在上海办刊物的国际朋友，打算除了印行定期刊物之外，还想印一些文学作品。他向鲁迅索稿，鲁迅就把我从苏联寄给他的莫斯科出版的中译本高尔基的“一月九日”交给他，并且写了一篇短序，可是，长期保存在鲁迅手中的中文的“一月九日”，还没有机会同中国读者见面，在印刷厂被没收了。中国读者长时间能见到的只有鲁迅的“集外集拾遗”中的“一月九日小引”而已。在反动时代，因为读高尔基的作品而受到监视，失掉自由的不知有多少人。
    整整二十年前，高尔基逝世，当时北平文化界踏破了铁鞋，找不到一个开追悼会的会场。只得在城外借了一个教会学校的礼堂开会。这就是现在北京大学办公楼上的小礼堂。当时因为交通工具困难，成群结队的青年，冒着酷暑，不顾迫害，由城内徒步去参加追悼会！正如夏衍谈到“母亲”的中译本在中国反动时期长期受到压迫时所说的：要从中国青年人的心里除掉该书的影响，是绝对不可能的。“它鼓舞了我们中国人，它已经成为禁不绝分不开的中国人民血肉中心灵中的构成部分了。”高尔基的全部作品以及他的整个精神，同战斗的中国人民，都成了不可分的一体。（附图片）
