Advancing Towards Socialism with the People of the Whole Country
——Speech by Representative Zhang Chong

I completely agree with the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

		Underwent a Fundamental Change

In the past year, the situation in Yunnan Province, like that in the rest of the country, has undergone a fundamental change. This change is the result of the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, continuously overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, and fully mobilizing the socialist revolutionary enthusiasm of all ethnic groups in the province. In the past, we often only saw the fact that Yunnan was liberated relatively late, had a weak work foundation, and faced many difficulties. However, we underestimated the rapid development of the objective situation and the growing revolutionary strength of the masses. In our actual work, we had right-leaning conservative shortcomings and errors. After the publication of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the CCP Central Committee's "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" based on this report, right-leaning conservative thinking was effectively criticized and overcome. The principles instructed by the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao became a tremendous material force driving the people of all ethnic groups in the province to advance by leaps and bounds. The agricultural cooperation movement became a truly mass-based revolutionary movement, characterized by unprecedented scale, momentum, fewer concerns, rapid development, and high quality. As of March this year, the province had basically completed the semi-socialist agricultural cooperation, with 34,918 advanced and elementary cooperatives, encompassing 2,813,949 farm households, accounting for 80.2% of the province's total farm households (of which those in advanced cooperatives accounted for 30%), and 89.47% of the total farm households in areas where land reform had been completed. At the same time, under the impetus of the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the influence of the high tide of socialist transformation in other major cities across the country, the socialist transformation of private industry, commerce, and handicrafts also achieved a decisive victory in a very short period of time.

		On the Industrial and Agricultural Production Fronts

Due to the development of the socialist revolution and the upsurge in the labor enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups, certain achievements were also made on the industrial and agricultural production fronts in 1955. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the province increased by 12.03% compared to 1954. Major crops all achieved varying degrees of increased production, with grain crops increasing by 623.44 million jin, exceeding the annual production increase plan. The total industrial output value fulfilled 102% of the annual plan. The proportion of the state-owned economy has increased significantly. Currently, the people of all ethnic groups in the province are continuing to carry out the production movement with high production enthusiasm. Since this spring, more than 2 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed throughout the province, and the water conservancy projects built can expand the irrigated area by more than 2.6 million mu. The amount of fertilizer has increased substantially compared to the same period last year. Without unexpected major natural disasters, this year will achieve even greater production increases than last year. Yunnan is rich in natural resources, which not only has great potential for developing industry, but also, due to its favorable climate, is suitable for developing various cash crops and other subtropical crops. The land is vast, with a large amount of arable wasteland yet to be reclaimed and utilized. Some areas with fertile land have not yet been developed or have been developed little, and the farming technology is generally backward. The land utilization rate of existing cultivated land is also not high, which shows that the potential for agricultural production is also very large. After the great development of cooperation, the old relations of production have been changed, and decentralized management has become collective management, which provides extremely favorable conditions for fully tapping the potential of agricultural production and developing agricultural production on a large scale. It is entirely possible for Yunnan to gradually achieve the various tasks set forth in the National Agricultural Development Program within twelve years. The problem lies in the need to continuously improve leadership thinking and improve work style in order to adapt to the development of the revolutionary situation and correctly lead the people of all ethnic groups in the province to continue to advance on the socialist path.

		Exposed Shortcomings in Work

After the high tide of the socialist revolution came, it exposed many shortcomings in our work. The main shortcomings are the lack of systematic and in-depth investigation and research on objective situations, the lack of a work style of consulting with the masses on everything, and insufficient concern for the specific difficulties of the masses in production and life. Local state organs are accustomed to handling affairs with administrative orders, and when considering problems, they often start from their own convenience first, not from the interests of the masses first. Some departments have not thoroughly overcome their right-leaning conservative thinking, often emphasizing objective difficulties, and lacking the revolutionary determination and courage to rely on the masses to overcome difficulties; they do not actively support and encourage advanced things enough, and they do not criticize and oppose backward things enough. On the other hand, in some places and some departments in our province, as Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in his report, there has already been an impatient and rash sentiment, and the work plan is divorced from reality and lacks a solid and reliable foundation. In industrial production and capital construction, there is also a tendency to unilaterally pursue quantity and speed while ignoring quality, economy, and safety. Some business departments, proceeding from subjective wishes, attempted to fully realize the 40 articles of the National Agricultural Development Program in two or three years, or even one or two years, assigning tasks too much and too hastily, regardless of priorities, which increased the burden on the masses. Some cooperatives have set excessively high production increase targets and lack specific measures to achieve these targets; most cooperatives have focused on grain production and neglected sideline production, or have paid attention to collective sideline production and neglected the household sideline production of members. Sideline income accounts for 30% of the income of farmers in our province, and 50% in individual areas. If the sideline problem is not seriously solved, there may be a risk of increased agricultural production but no increase in income for members, which will affect the development and consolidation of cooperatives and harm the labor enthusiasm of the masses. The above situation shows that the central government's pointing out that it is necessary to oppose both conservatism and impatience in actual work is very timely and completely necessary.

		Do a Good Job in Ethnic Work

Yunnan is a multi-ethnic province, and ethnic minorities account for one-third of the province's population. Doing a good job in ethnic work is of utmost importance to the socialist transformation and socialist construction of the province. In the past year, there has also been significant progress in this area. In areas where land reform has been completed in the interior and cooperation has greatly developed, all ethnic minorities have participated in agricultural production cooperatives. Among the cooperatives in the province, 21,000 (about 60% of the total number of cooperatives) are run by one ethnic minority alone, or by several ethnic minorities jointly, or by Han and ethnic minorities jointly. Some societies include 9 ethnic groups. Therefore, in carrying out the cooperation movement, it is necessary to pay full attention to ethnic characteristics and grasp the following principles: First, vigorously cultivate cadres of all ethnic groups and let the socialist advanced backbones of each ethnic group lead the farmers of all ethnic groups to run the cooperatives well; second, all ethnic groups should respect each other's customs, languages, religious beliefs, and other ethnic characteristics: third, all ethnic groups should help each other and learn from each other, especially the majority helping the minority, and the advanced taking care of the backward first. In this way, we can promote cooperation and production movements on the basis of ethnic unity, and further consolidate ethnic unity in cooperation and production movements, and jointly progress and jointly build a happy life. In ethnic minority areas on the border that meet the conditions, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, combining local ethnic characteristics, and according to the requirements of the majority of the people of all ethnic minorities and the wishes of public leaders, land reform is carried out through peaceful consultation. So far, areas with a population of 600,000 have been successfully completed. The development of the entire movement is normal and healthy. It is not only enthusiastically supported by the broad masses, but also actively sponsored and supported by ethnic public leaders. Through peaceful consultation and reform, the requirements of the farmers of all ethnic groups have been basically met, and ethnic public leaders have been helped to achieve varying degrees of political progress, thereby making the internal and inter-ethnic groups more united, and new atmospheres have emerged in all aspects. In areas that have undergone peaceful consultation and reform, and in areas that do not implement land reform, mutual assistance and cooperation movements are steadily carried out under the voluntary principle of the masses and with the strong support of the state, and agricultural production cooperatives are being built on a trial basis. This creates favorable conditions for further developing the economic and cultural undertakings of all ethnic groups in the border areas, gradually eliminating the de facto inequality left over from history, and jointly entering socialism with the people of all ethnic groups in the interior. As mentioned above, the ethnic situation, whether in the interior or on the border, has already undergone or is undergoing fundamental changes. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of ethnic minority work with a socialist positive attitude based on this new situation. However, in some aspects of our actual work, there are still shortcomings of generalization and viewing ethnic issues with old perspectives. There is a lack of serious and specific investigation and research on the different production conditions and characteristics of economic life of various ethnic minorities in the province, and a lack of sufficient special assistance. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the party and government leading organs of the province are now taking specific measures economically and organizationally in conjunction with the inspection of ethnic work, so that ethnic work can move forward on the original basis and advance towards socialism with the people of the whole country.

    同全国人民一道向社会主义前进
    ——张冲代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长的报告。
                  起了一个根本变化
    一年以来，云南省的情况也和全国一样起了一个根本的变化。这个变化，是在中共中央和国务院的正确领导下，不断克服右倾保守思想，充分发挥全省各族人民的社会主义革命积极性的结果。过去我们往往只看到云南解放较晚，工作基础较差，困难较多的一面，而对于客观形势的迅速发展和群众革命力量的日益增长的一面，则曾经估计不足，在实际工作中，曾产生过右倾保守的缺点和错误。毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中共中央根据这个报告而作的“关于农业合作化问题的决议”公布以后，右倾保守思想才获得了有效的批判和克服。中共中央和毛主席所指示的道理，成了推动全省各族人民大踏步前进的巨大的物质力量，农业合作化运动形成了真正的群众性的革命运动，具有前所未有的规模大，声势大，顾虑少，发展快，质量高的特点。截至今年三月，全省已基本上完成了半社会主义性质的农业合作化，有高级社和初级社34，918个，入社农户2，813，949户，占全省总农户的80.2％（其中入高级社的占总农户30％），占已完成土地改革地区总农户的89.47％。同时，在农业合作化高潮的推动和全国其他大城市的社会主义改造高潮的影响下，对于私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造工作，也在很短时间内，取得了决定性的胜利。
    在工农业生产战线上
    由于社会主义革命形势的发展和各族人民劳动积极性的高涨，1955年，在工农业生产战线上也取得了一定的成绩。全省工农业总产值比1954年增长12.03％。主要农作物都获得了不同程度的增产，其中粮食作物增产62，344万斤，超额完成了年度增产计划。工业总产值完成年度计划的102％。国营经济的比重有了显著的增长。目前，全省各族人民，正以高度的生产热情继续开展生产运动。今春以来，全省已开荒200多万亩，兴修的水利工程可扩大灌溉面积260多万亩，肥料比去年同期有大量的增加。倘无意外的特大的自然灾害，今年将比去年获得更大的增产。云南天然资源丰富，不仅发展工业有巨大潜力，而且因为气候良好，适宜于发展多种经济作物和其他亚热带作物；土地辽阔，有大量可耕荒地尚未开垦利用，若干土地肥沃的地区尚未开发或开发不多，耕作技术一般落后，现有耕地的土地使用率也不高，足见农业生产的潜力也是很大的。而在合作化大发展，旧的生产关系已经改变，分散经营变为集体经营之后，就给充分地发掘农业生产潜力，大规模地发展农业生产提供了极为有利的条件。在云南以十二年的时间逐步实现全国农业发展纲要所提出的各项任务是完全可能的。问题在于必须不断提高领导思想和改进工作作风，才能适应革命形势的发展，正确地领导全省各族人民在社会主义的轨道上继续前进。
    暴露了工作中的缺点
    社会主义的革命高潮来了以后，暴露了我们在工作中存在着许多缺点。主要是对客观情况缺少系统深入的调查研究，缺少遇事和群众商量的作风，对群众生产和生活上的具体困难关心不够。地方国家机关习惯于以行政命令办事，考虑问题往往首先从自己方便出发，不是首先从群众利益出发。有些部门的右倾保守思想尚未彻底克服，往往强调客观困难，缺乏依靠群众克服困难的革命毅力和勇气；对先进的东西积极支持和鼓励不够，对落后的东西批判和反对不够。另一方面，在我省若干地方和若干部门中，正如李先念副总理在报告中所指出的，已经发生急躁冒进的情绪，工作计划脱离实际，缺乏切实可靠的基础。在工业生产和基本建设中，同样存在着片面地追求多和快而忽视好、省和安全的偏向。若干业务部门，从主观愿望出发，企图在二、三年，甚至一、二年内就全部实现全国农业发展纲要40条，不分轻重缓急，过多过急地往下派任务，增加了群众的负担。有些合作社增产指标订得过高，缺乏完成指标的具体措施；大多数合作社重视了粮食生产而忽视了副业生产，或注意了集体搞副业而忽视社员的家庭副业。副业收入占我省农民收入的30％，个别地区占50％，如不认真解决副业问题，可能形成农业增产但社员不能增加收入的危险，结果就会影响合作社的发展巩固，损害群众的劳动积极性。上述情况表明：中央所指出的在实际工作中既要反对保守主义，又要反对急躁情绪是非常及时和完全必要的。
    做好民族工作
    云南是多民族的省份，少数民族人口占全省人口的三分之一。做好民族工作对全省的社会主义改造和社会主义建设，具有极其重要的意义。过去一年，这方面的工作也有了重大的进展。在内地土地改革已经完成、合作化大发展的地区，各少数民族都已分别参加了农业生产合作社。在全省合作社中，有21，000个（约占合作社总数的60％）是一个少数民族自己办、或几个少数民族联合办、或汉族和少数民族联合办的。有的社包括着9种民族。因此，在开展合作化运动当中，不能不充分注意民族特点，掌握以下几个原则：一是大力培养各民族的干部，由各民族自己的社会主义先进骨干分子去领导各族农民办好合作社；二是各民族之间互相尊重风俗习惯、语言、宗教信仰和其他民族特点：三是各民族之间互相帮助，互相学习，特别是多数帮助少数，先进首先照顾落后。这样，在民族团结的基础上促进合作化和生产运动，又在合作化和生产运动中进一步巩固民族团结，共同进步，共同建设幸福生活。在边疆已具备条件的民族地区，按照宪法的规定，结合当地民族特点，根据各少数民族大多数人民的要求和公众领袖人物的意愿，采取和平协商方式进行土地改革。到目前为止，已有60万人口的地区胜利完成。整个运动的发展是正常的，健康的。不仅为广大群众所热烈拥护，也获得了民族公众领袖人物的积极赞助和支持。通过和平协商改革，基本上满足了各族农民的要求，并帮助各民族公众领袖人物在政治上获得了不同程度的进步，从而使民族内部和各民族相互间更加团结，各方面都出现了新的气象。在经过和平协商改革的地区，和不实行土地改革的地区，根据群众自愿的原则，在国家大力扶植下，稳步地开展互助合作运动，重点试建农业生产合作社。这就为进一步发展边疆各民族的经济、文化事业，逐步消灭历史上遗留下来的事实上的不平等，和内地各族人民共同进入社会主义创造了有利条件，如上所说，不论内地或边疆，民族情况已经发生或正在发生根本性的变化。必须根据这种新的情况，用社会主义的积极态度来加强对少数民族工作的领导。而我们在实际工作的某些方面仍然存在一般化和以老观点看待民族问题的缺点。对于省内各个少数民族不同的生产条件，经济生活的特点，缺少认真的具体的调查研究，缺少足够的特殊帮助。为了克服这些缺点，省的党政领导机关现在正结合检查民族工作，从经济上和组织上采取具体措施，以使民族工作在原有基础上前进一步，和全国人民一道向社会主义前进。
