Comrade Editor:

I am a young woman who has been deceived and insulted. I want to accuse Jia Linzhen, the former Propaganda Minister of the Youth League Committee of the directly subordinate engineering company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering (a Communist Party member), of his consistent sinful behavior of toying with women!

In 1954, I was transferred from the military to work in the trade union of the directly subordinate engineering company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. At that time, I was only eighteen years old and a naive girl. Soon, I met Jia Linzhen. He was very "concerned" about my work, study, and life, and he showed me so much enthusiasm and sincerity. Gradually, I developed good feelings for him.

Later, I heard from comrades that in 1953, in order to pursue a woman surnamed Fan in Anshan City, he forced his wife to divorce him and abandoned their four-year-old child. When I asked him about this, he made all sorts of explanations, saying that he had been deceived and now felt extremely regretful, and vowed to always be faithful to me in the future. Because I was not clear about the truth, and coupled with my naivety, I easily trusted him, and in January 1955, he seduced me by despicable means. Later I found out that shortly after he expressed his regret and made promises, because I went home for a period of time due to illness, he immediately pursued another female comrade.

Soon, I felt unwell, dizzy, and nauseous, and it seemed that I was pregnant. I suggested to him that we should get married quickly. He verbally agreed, but in reality, he became more and more indifferent and distant towards me. When the doctor confirmed that I was indeed pregnant, I went to him, but he refused to speak to me! I was so anxious that I became ill. Comrades were very concerned about me and often came to see me, but he happily went to the city to eat, drink, and have fun, looking for new "lovers"; and he also wrote a letter to bring that woman surnamed Fan from Anshan to Changchun, where they stayed in a hotel for three days. During my illness, he even slanderously said that the child was not his, forcing me to break off relations with him.

His ugly behavior made me realize that I had taken the wrong path. I decided to confess this matter to the Youth League organization. When he learned about this, on the one hand, he threatened me, saying, "I have been in the revolution for seven or eight years. This little thing won't make the organization do anything to me. You will not only be punished but also lose face!" On the other hand, he became enthusiastic towards me again, expressing his agreement to marry me. I thought he had truly turned over a new leaf, and for the sake of the child to be born, I agreed to marry him. However, I still confessed our problem to the organization. The Party and Youth League organizations criticized and educated us. He was given a punishment of being placed on probation within the Party for one year, and I was also given a Youth League disciplinary action. At that time, he expressed to the Party organization that he would correct his past mistakes and live well with me.

After the marriage, I tried my best to maintain a good relationship with him, treating him with utmost care. However, he consistently refused to speak to me; when I took the initiative to speak to him, he would glare at me and say, "Don't be nagging! I hate you." I bled twice in the month before giving birth. The first time, I was absent from work for three days, but he didn't even ask about it, and even refused to bring me food from the canteen. When comrades found out, they brought me food and water, which allowed me to be taken care of during my illness. The second time, after I lay down, he even more falsely accused me of deliberately feigning illness and viciously wanted to force me to move to the single dormitory.

The child was born in December. My mother came from afar to take care of us. There was often no money at home to buy food, but he didn't care. Although I had only given birth fourteen days ago, I had to brave the wind and snow to walk more than twenty li to borrow money. As soon as I reached my full month postpartum, he went to Anshan City to see his "lover" surnamed Fan. After he came back, he repeatedly asked me to be "conscious" and "quickly think of my own ways." On March 10th, he finally threw away all my belongings and kicked me and the child out of the house.

After the Party organization discovered this situation, they criticized him and asked him to make a self-criticism at the meeting. In front of everyone, he appeared very sincere, saying, "I am determined not to do this again in the future." However, as soon as the meeting adjourned, he fiercely scolded me, scolded the Party organization, and forced me to go to court to divorce him. I painfully asked him to consider the child's issue. He said, "Who cares about who, find your own happiness!"

I can no longer live with such a villain who consistently toys with women! In order to uphold Party discipline and the law, I request the Party organization of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the national judicial organs to severely punish this degenerate element who has tarnished the glorious title of Communist Party member!

    控诉欺骗和侮辱妇女的贾麟桢编辑同志：
    我是一个受欺骗，受侮辱的女青年。我要控诉原建筑工程部直属工程公司团委会宣传部长（共产党员）贾麟桢一贯玩弄女性的罪恶行为！
    1954年，我由部队转业到建筑工程部直属工程公司做工会工作。当时我才十八岁，是个天真的女孩子。不久，我认识了贾麟桢。他十分“关心”我的工作，学习和生活，对我表现得那末热情和诚恳。渐渐地，我对他也有了好感。
    后来，我听同志说起：1953年他为了追求鞍山市一个姓范的妇女，就逼着他妻子和他离婚，抛弃了他们四岁的孩子。当我问起这件事的时候，他就百般解释，说他是受了骗，现在感到无比的悔恨，并且表示今后一定永远对我忠实。由于我对事实真相还不清楚，再加上幼稚无知，就轻易地信任了他，并且在1955年1月被他用卑鄙的手段诱奸了。后来我才知道，在他表示悔恨和提出保证的不久以后，由于我生病回家一段时期，他又马上追求另外一个女同志了。
    不久，我觉得身体不好，头晕、呕吐，似乎是怀孕了，就向他提出应该赶快结婚。他口头上答应了，但是实际上对我一天比一天冷淡和疏远。当医生证明我确实是怀孕以后，我去找他，他竟拒绝同我讲话！我急得生了病。同志们对我很关怀，经常来看我，他却自管自兴高采烈地到市内去吃喝玩乐，物色新的“爱人”；并且又写信把鞍山那位姓范的女同志叫到长春来，在旅馆里住了三天。在我的病中，他还血口喷人地说孩子不是他的，逼我同他断绝关系。
    他这种丑恶行为，使我认识到自己走错了路。我决定向团组织交代这个问题。他知道了这个情况，一方面威胁我说：“我革命七八年啦，闹这点小事，组织也不会把我怎么的，你可不但要受处分，还要丢人！”另一方面又变得对我热情起来，表示同意结婚。我以为他真正回心转意了，为了将要出生的孩子，就同意和他结婚。但是，我还是向组织交代了我们的问题。党、团组织对我们进行了批评和教育，他受到了留党察看一年的处分，我也受了团纪处分。当时，他向党组织表示要痛改前非，同我好好地生活下去。
    婚后，我尽力搞好夫妻关系，对他体贴万分。但是，他一直拒绝同我讲话；我主动同他讲话，他就瞪着眼说：“别囉嗦！我恨你。”我在临产前的一个月流了二次血，第一次三天没有上班，他连问也不问，还拒绝替我从食堂带饭。同志们知道了，给我送饭送水，才使我在病中得到照顾。第二次我躺倒以后，他更诬蔑我是故意装病，又恶毒地要撵我搬到独身宿舍去住。
    十二月份孩子生下来了。我母亲老远地赶来照顾我们，家里经常没钱买粮食，他也不管。我虽然分娩才十四天，只好冒着风雪走出二十多里地去借钱。我刚满月，他就到鞍山市去看他那个姓范的“爱人”去了。回来以后，他一再要我“自觉点”，“快想自己的办法去”。三月十日，他终于把我的东西都扔掉，把我和孩子从家里赶出来了。
    党组织发现这种情况以后，对他进行了批评，要他在会上做检讨。当着大家的面，他表现得非常诚恳地说：“下决心今后再也不这样了。”可是，刚散会，他就凶狠地骂我，骂党组织，逼我到法院去和他离婚。我痛心地要求他考虑一下孩子的问题。他说：“谁管得着谁，自己找自己的幸福去！”
    我再也不能同这样一个一贯玩弄女性的恶棍生活下去了！为了严肃党纪国法，我要求建筑工程部党组织和国家司法机关给这个玷污了共产党员光荣称号的、卑鄙无耻的堕落分子以严厉制裁！
