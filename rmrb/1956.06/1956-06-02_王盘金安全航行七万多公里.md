Wang Panjin, a crew member of the No. 25 wooden barge of the Wuxi City Wooden Sailboat First Transportation Cooperative, has safely navigated 76,000 kilometers in the six years since liberation without a single accident.

Wang Panjin has rich navigation experience and pays close attention to safety at all times. Each time he accepts a new waterway navigation task, he always tries to understand the situation beforehand and find ways to avoid accidents. For example, he knew in advance that there were rapids near the Xiannvmiao (Fairy Temple) in northern Jiangsu that swept across the waterway, making it easy to run the boat aground on shoals. When they first sailed to this dangerous passage, they used cables to secure the hull, and sent some people ashore to pull the towline upstream, so that the fleet passed through the rapids safely.

    王盘金安全航行七万多公里
    无锡市木帆船第一运输合作社二十五号木驳的船员王盘金，解放六年多来没有出过一次事故，安全航行了七万六千多公里。
    王盘金有丰富的航行经验，而且平时十分注意安全。他每次接受新航道航行任务，事先总要了解好情况，想办法避免意外事故。如他事先知道了苏北仙女庙附近有横扫航道的激流，容易把船冲到浅滩搁浅，当他们第一次航行到这个险道的时候，就用缆绳将船身系牢，抽一部分人上岸在上流拉纤，使船队安全通过了激流。
