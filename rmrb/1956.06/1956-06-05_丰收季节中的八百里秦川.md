Peasants in More Than 20 Counties Along the Wei River Begin Harvesting Wheat

    Starting from May 29th, farmers in more than 20 counties along the Wei River, including Xi'an, Xianyang, Lintong, and Weinan, have successively begun harvesting wheat. As early as the beginning of May, various localities actively carried out labor organization for the wheat harvest and prepared for repairing and adding agricultural tools. The Weinan Special District prepared more than 360,000 sickles, 420,000 forks, and 750,000 brooms in April to supply the needs of various agricultural cooperatives during the summer harvest.

    Judging from the agricultural cooperatives that have already threshed, a bumper harvest this year is assured. For example, the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Tongguan County has already threshed the first batch of wheat, totaling 610 mu, with an average yield of 441 jin per mu.

Combine Harvesters are Popular Everywhere

    This year, many combine harvesters will appear in the wheat fields of the eight hundred li Qinchuan. The eleven combine harvesters of the seven tractor stations in Dali, Chang'an, Xingping and other counties have been inspected, adjusted, and test-driven, and some have already begun harvesting in the wheat fields of state-owned farms or agricultural production cooperatives. It is the first time to use combine harvesters to harvest wheat on a large area of land in Shaanxi Province. The farmers of the agricultural cooperatives are welcoming the arrival of combine harvesters with unparalleled joy. When the combine harvester of the Chang'an Tractor Station drove to the "May Fourth" Agricultural Cooperative, it was warmly welcomed by all the members. The drivers expressed their guarantee to harvest the wheat cleanly.

Cadres, Workers, and Students Help with the Wheat Harvest

    Cadres, workers, and students in various counties of the Baoji and Weinan Special Districts, as well as Chang'an, Xianyang, Hu County, and Xi'an City, are actively preparing to help farmers harvest wheat. The Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office has issued instructions to its affiliated agencies and counties, mobilizing cadres to help farmers harvest for three days. More than 4,000 people from agencies, schools, factories, and construction sites in the Changle District of Xi'an City have signed up to help farmers with the summer harvest, most of them using their Sunday rest time to help farmers harvest. The locally-run Xi'an Paint Factory and People's Enamel Factory are both using the factory's trucks to help farmers transport wheat.

Excellent "May Fourth" Wheat

    The "May Fourth" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chang'an County cultivated one mu of "May Fourth" wheat this year, which has already shown the superiority of this fine variety. This one mu of "May Fourth" wheat was planted in the same field as "Bima No. 1" wheat, with "May Fourth" wheat at both ends and "Bima No. 1" wheat in the middle. There is a big difference between the two types of wheat. "Bima No. 1" wheat is five inches taller than "May Fourth" wheat, and most of it has lodged, while the thick stalks of "May Fourth" wheat have not lodged, and the ears of wheat are neatly like they have been cut with scissors. According to Li Jingren, a technical cadre from the Technology Extension Station, "May Fourth" wheat is better than "Bima No. 1" wheat in terms of yield and disease resistance. According to predictions, "May Fourth" wheat can produce 827 jin per mu, while "Bima No. 1" wheat can only produce 699 jin per mu.

Sweet Potato Stubbles Wheat Grows Vigorously

    North of Dengjia Village in the western suburbs of Xi'an City, there is a wheat field of three or four mu, where the wheat grows densely and vigorously. This is the sweet potato stubbles wheat trial-planted by the Jinfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative. According to the predicted situation, each mu can harvest more than 700 jin of wheat. In the past, the farmers of Jinfeng Cooperative, like farmers in other areas, were not accustomed to planting wheat in sweet potato fields because the sweet potatoes were harvested after the Frost's Descent, which was past the season for planting wheat. This year, due to the bumper harvest, the cooperative is preparing to summarize the experience of sweet potato stubbles wheat well, so as to better utilize the stubble land and expand the wheat fields next year.

### 丰收季节中的八百里秦川

    丰收季节中的八百里秦川
    渭河两岸二十多县农民开镰割麦
    从五月二十九日起，沿着渭河两岸的西安和咸阳、临潼、渭南等二十多个县的农民，陆续开始收割小麦。早在五月初，各地就积极地进行了麦收的劳动组织和整修添置农具等准备工作。渭南专区在四月份就准备了三十六万多把镰刀，四十二万多把杈和七十五万把扫帚，供应各农业社在夏收中的需要。
    从已经打场的农业社来看，今年的大丰收是有把握了。例如，潼关县先锋农业社的农民已经碾出了第一场小麦共六百一十亩，每亩平均产麦达四百四十一斤。联合收割机处处受欢迎
    今年，在八百里秦川中的麦田里将出现很多联合收割机。大荔、长安、兴平等县的七个拖拉机站的十一台联合收割机，已经检查、调整和试车完毕，有的已经开始在国营农场或农业生产合作社的麦田里进行收割。利用联合收割机在大面积的土地上收割小麦，在陕西省还是第一次。农业社的农民们都以无比喜悦的心情，迎接联合收割机的到来。当长安拖拉机站的联合收割机开到“五四”农业社的时候，受到了全体社员的热烈欢迎。驾驶人员表示保证把小麦收割干净。干部工人学生帮助麦收
    宝鸡、渭南专区各县和长安、咸阳、鄠县以及西安市的干部、工人和学生积极准备帮助农民收割小麦。渭南专署已向所属各机关和县下达指示，动员干部帮助农民收割三天。西安市长乐区的机关、学校、工厂和工地报名帮助农民夏收的有四千多人，他们大都是利用星期天休息时间帮助农民收割。地方国营西安油漆厂和人民搪瓷厂，都用工厂的汽车帮助农民运送小麦。
  优良的“五四”号小麦
    长安县“五四”农业生产合作社，今年培育了一亩“五四”号小麦，已经显示出这个良种的优越性。这一亩“五四”号小麦是和“碧玛一号”小麦种在一块地里，两头是“五四”号小麦，当中是“碧玛一号”小麦，两种小麦有很大的区别，“碧玛一号”小麦比“五四”号小麦高出五寸，大部分都倒伏了，而“五四”号小麦粗壮的麦秆没有倒伏，麦穗整齐的像是用剪刀剪过了的一样。据技术推广站的技术干部李景仁介绍，“五四”号小麦不论产量、抗病能力都比“碧玛一号”小麦好。根据预测，“五四”号小麦每亩能产827斤，“碧玛一号”小麦每亩只产699斤。白薯回茬小麦生长茁壮
    西安市西郊邓家村村北，有一块三、四亩大的麦田，麦子生长得稠密而茁壮，这就是进丰农业生产合作社试种的白薯回茬小麦。根据预测的情况，每亩可收小麦七百多斤。过去进丰社的农民和其它地区的农民一样，不习惯在白薯地里种麦，因为白薯收获是在霜降之后，已经过了种小麦的季节。今年由于获得丰收，这个社正准备很好的总结白薯回茬麦的经验，以便来年更好的利用回茬地，扩大麦田。
