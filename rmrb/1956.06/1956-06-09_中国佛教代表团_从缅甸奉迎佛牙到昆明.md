Xinhua News Agency Report: The Chinese Buddhist delegation, led by Head of Delegation Huba Meng, which attended the closing ceremony of the Sixth Buddhist Synod in Burma and the 2,500th anniversary celebrations of the Parinirvana of Sakyamuni, escorted the Buddha's Tooth Relic from Burma by plane back to Kunming on the afternoon of the 8th. The Burmese Buddha's Tooth Relic Escort Delegation, headed by Burmese Federal Government Secretary-General U Kyin Maung Phyu, also arrived in Kunming on the same plane.

A grand ceremony was held at the airport to welcome the Buddha's Tooth Relic. After Xirao Jiacuo presented a Hada to the Buddha's Tooth Relic, he said at the meeting that the fact that Buddhists in China and Burma both have the opportunity to pay homage to the Buddha's Tooth Relic is a testament to our deep gratitude to the governments of China and Burma, whose support has made this extraordinary opportunity possible.

The head of the Burmese Buddha's Tooth Relic Escort Delegation, U Kyin Maung Phyu, said in his speech that bringing the Buddha's Tooth Relic to Burma for the Burmese people to worship was something our ancestors were unable to achieve. The fact that believers in China and Burma are fortunate enough to worship the Buddha's Tooth Relic will surely enhance the peaceful friendship between the two countries. He concluded by wishing that the friendship between the Burmese and Chinese people would last forever.

The Buddha's Tooth Relic was brought to Yangon from China by the Burmese Federal Buddhist Delegation on October 15, 1955. At that time, Burmese Federal President Ba U and Prime Minister U Nu personally went to the airport to welcome it. In the past seven months or so, more than one million people from all over Burma went to Yangon to pay homage to the Buddha's Tooth Relic. On June 5, the Burmese Buddhist Association held a grand handover ceremony at Yangon Airport, where President Ba U personally presented the Buddha's Tooth Relic to Zhao Puchu, the deputy head of the Chinese Buddhist Delegation. On its return journey, the delegation stopped in Mandalay for three days to allow the people of Mandalay and Upper Burma to pay homage to the Buddha's Tooth Relic.

Now, the Buddha's Tooth Relic is enshrined in the Yuantong Temple in Kunming for Buddhist believers from all over to pay homage.

    中国佛教代表团
    从缅甸奉迎佛牙到昆明
    据新华社讯　到缅甸参加第六次佛经结集大会的闭幕典礼和释迦牟尼?槃两千五百周年庆祝典礼的中国佛教代表团，在团长祜巴勐率领下，八日下午从缅甸奉迎佛牙乘飞机回到昆明。以缅甸联邦政府秘书长吴庆貌漂为首的缅甸佛牙护送代表团也同机来到昆明。
    机场上举行了隆重的奉迎佛牙典礼。喜饶嘉错向佛牙献哈达后，在会上讲话说，中缅两国佛教徒能够都有机会瞻仰佛牙，使我们深切地感谢中缅两国政府，由于两国政府的支持，才使这一殊胜因缘得以实现。
    缅甸佛牙护送代表团团长吴庆貌漂在讲话中说，将佛牙奉迎到缅甸供缅甸人民朝拜，这是我们的祖先没有能够实现的事。中缅两国信徒能够有幸地瞻拜佛牙，两国的和平友谊一定能够日益增进。他最后祝愿缅中人民的友谊万世长存。
    佛牙是在1955年10月15日由缅甸联邦佛教代表团从中国奉迎到仰光的。当时缅甸联邦总统巴宇和总理吴努都曾亲到机场奉迎。在过去七个多月中，有一百多万人从缅甸各地到仰光向佛牙朝拜。六月五日，缅甸佛教会在仰光机场举行了隆重的交还仪式，由巴宇总统亲自把佛牙奉给中国佛教代表团副团长赵朴初，代表团在返国途中，曾经在曼德勒停留三天，供曼德勒和上缅甸人民朝拜佛牙。
    现在，佛牙已经供奉在昆明的圆通寺里，供各地佛教信徒朝拜。
