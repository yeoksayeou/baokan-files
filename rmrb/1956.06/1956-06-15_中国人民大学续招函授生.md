Renmin University of China has newly added undergraduate correspondence courses this year, with three majors including industrial economics, trade economics, and law, enrolling on-the-job cadres from cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. After five years of study, correspondence students can receive a university undergraduate diploma upon graduation.
