    A Supply and Marketing Cooperative that Actively Supports Farmers' Sideline Production

    (By our reporter) The Wangchenggang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinjian County, Jiangxi Province, actively purchases local products to help farmers develop sideline production and increase members' income. The district supply and marketing cooperative, hearing that the vegetable cooperatives in the suburbs of Nanchang City needed small bamboo poles to support bean vines, signed a contract with the agricultural cooperative to purchase 200,000 bamboo poles. The agricultural cooperative completed this task in half a month, which can increase farmers' income by 2,000 yuan. In order to widely carry out the purchase of local and special products, the district supply and marketing cooperative recently held a local and special product purchase exhibition, exhibiting 80 kinds of Chinese medicinal materials, many of which are local products. Members know that the state is purchasing a large amount of Chinese medicine and are prepared to vigorously collect it. In order to facilitate the purchase, the district supply and marketing cooperative established a Chinese medicine purchasing department and also signed a contract with the district and township joint Chinese medicine clinic, asking them to act as inspectors. Chinese medicine alone is planned to complete a purchase task of 7,000 yuan by the end of the year.

    积极支持农民副业生产的一个供销合作社
    本报讯　江西省新建县望城岗区供销合作社，积极收购土产品，帮助农民发展副业生产，增加社员收入。区供销合作社听说南昌市郊蔬菜合作社要小竹子牵豆角藤，就同农业合作社订立了收购竹子二十万根的合同。半个月农业合作社就完成了这项任务，农民可以增加收入二千元。区供销合作社为广泛开展土特产品的收购工作，于最近举行了一次土特产收购展览会，展览会展出了八十种中药材，很多都是当地的出产品。社员们知道国家大量收购中药都准备大力采集。为了便利收购，区供销社成立了中药收购部，还同区乡中医联合诊所订了合约，请他们代为验收。光中药一项，计划年底完成七千元的收购任务。
