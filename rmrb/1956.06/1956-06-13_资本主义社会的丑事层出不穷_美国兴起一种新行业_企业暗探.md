Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A May article in the American magazine "Fortune" reported that a new industry is booming in the United States: "corporate spies." American entrepreneurs are increasingly employing "corporate spies" to snatch contracts from each other, steal new inventions, predict market trends, and rush to obtain patents. It is estimated that the Ford Motor Company currently employs more than thirty "corporate spies."

The work of these spies includes everything from secretly acquiring office waste paper and bribing office attendants and maids to using the latest scientific inventions. "Fortune" magazine said that common methods include: placing a radio transceiver, the size of a cigarette case, under the target's desk; using highly sensitive listening devices to eavesdrop on office conversations from across the street; filming lip movements when sounds cannot be heard, and then translating the lip movements into language; and tapping telephones. Another method is to send airplanes or helicopters to fly over other people's factories to photograph new inventions or styles.

To prevent this kind of theft, General Motors has recently installed a special automatic curtain that automatically lowers upon hearing the sound of an airplane.

The magazine said that spies also occasionally use impersonation methods, such as posing as police officers or pretending to be electrical repair workers, to sneak into the target's office and steal information.

    资本主义社会的丑事层出不穷
    美国兴起一种新行业——“企业暗探”
    据新华社讯　五月份的美国“幸福”杂志在一篇文章里报道，美国一种新的行业——“企业暗探”正在兴隆起来。美国企业家之间愈来愈多地雇用“企业暗探”，来彼此抢夺合同，窃取新发明，预测市场趋势，争先获得专利权等。据估计，福特汽车公司目前就雇有三十名以上的“企业暗探”。
    这种暗探的工作的内容包括从秘密收购办公室废纸以及买通办公室服务员和女佣人，一直到应用最新式的科学发明。“幸福”杂志说，一般的方法有：在对象的办公桌底下放上一个只有纸烟匣那样大小的无线电收发报机；用最敏感的收听器在对街听取办公室谈话；在听不到声音的时候设法把嘴的动作摄成电影，然后把嘴的动作译成语言；偷听电话。还有一种方法是派飞机或直升飞机飞到别人工厂上空拍摄新发明或新式样。
    为了防止这种偷窃，通用汽车公司新近特别安装了一种自动帘幕，它在听到飞机响声后可以自动落下。
    杂志说，暗探们也不时采用冒名顶替的办法，如假扮警察，伪装修理电线工人等，偷入对象的办公室窃取情报。
