Xinhua News Agency Report:

    “Dead books” long piled up in the warehouse of Nankai University Library have now become valuable materials for carrying out scientific research.

    These books are various books, periodicals, and thread-bound books on literature and history published before liberation. For example, collections of treaties signed with imperialist countries invading China during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns, historical materials on diplomacy in the late Qing Dynasty, the "Imperial Edicts Memorialized" from the Guangxu period, and complete sets of customs statistical registers from the past century are all very useful for studying modern Chinese history and economic issues.

    Many teachers at Nankai University have begun to use these materials. Professor Meng Zhisun of the Chinese Language and Literature Department had been unable to buy Wu Jingzi's "Wen Mu Shan Fang Ji" for five years, but this time he found it among the "dead books" in the library.

    With the help of faculty, staff, and students, Nankai University Library has sorted out more than 70,000 accumulated books and put them on display. The library plans to sort out more than 80,000 more volumes by the summer vacation this year.

### 把“死书”变“活书”

    把“死书”变“活书”
    据新华社讯　长期堆积在南开大学图书馆仓库里的“死书”，现在已经成为开展科学研究的有价值的资料。
    这些书是解放前出版的各种图书期刊和文史方面的线装书等。像咸丰、同治年间同当时侵华的帝国主义国家订立的条约汇集、清季外交史料、光绪年间的“谕折汇存”和近百年来的整套海关统计册等，对研究中国近代历史、经济问题都很有用处。
    南开大学的许多教师已经开始利用这些资料。中国语言文学系教授孟志荪需要的吴敬梓著的“文木山房集”一书，五年来一直没有买到，这次也从图书馆的“死书”中找到了。
    南开大学图书馆依靠师生员工的帮助，已经整理出七万多册积存的图书，并且陈列出来。图书馆计划到今年暑假再整理出八万多册。
