How Guangdong Solves the Current Difficulties of Small Vendors
By our reporters Huang Xiangqing and Wu Erxiang

    Among small vendors in many cities and towns in Guangdong Province, some once believed that they had "applauded the socialist transformation at the wrong time"; some used "joint ventures that can't be joined, goods that can't be supplied, loans that can't be borrowed, and off-seasons that can't be survived..." to describe their current situation. The situation of some small vendors is indeed difficult. For example, for vegetable and food vendors who have been organized in Huizhou Town, it is difficult for families with many members to maintain their original living standards; 60% of those who have not been organized are in a state of semi-shutdown. According to a survey of the business situation in the first quarter of some representative markets: the turnover of seven intermediate markets is increasing month by month, six county towns (primary markets) have slightly decreased, and the rural markets in nine districts belonging to eight counties have decreased month by month.

    Guangdong is a province with relatively developed commerce. There are more than 310,000 small vendors, with more than 430,000 people, accounting for 94.5% of the total number of commercial households in the province and 82.6% of the total number of commercial employees. Last year, their turnover accounted for more than half of the total commercial turnover in the province. They are spread all over the vast areas of the province like a spider web, extending like countless tentacles into many remote villages. In some remote villages, without them, even a needle and thread, or a bottle of Ji Zhong Shui for emergency relief, farmers would have to spend half a day traveling dozens of miles back and forth to buy it. This shows that small vendors are indispensable in commodity circulation and in the economic life of urban and rural people. However, why, when they are enthusiastically accepting transformation and their socialist consciousness and enthusiasm are gradually increasing, do some small vendors experience inconsistent phenomena such as declining business and even financial difficulties? From the recent Guangdong Provincial Conference of Small Vendors and the information reflected by various regions before the meeting, we learned that this is related to the failure to implement the policy of "overall planning and comprehensive arrangement" and the "squeeze" and "pressure" practices of some state-owned and supply and marketing cooperative commercial staff on small vendors.

          Difficulties in Supply of Goods and Funds

    In many areas, there is a phenomenon that goods operated by small vendors cannot be supplied. In Chengmai County, the shortage of daily necessities of various sizes has reached 117 items. In Deqing County, in addition to small commodities, even commonly used Chinese medicines and prepared medicines are out of stock. Many counties in the Foshan area do not have fish for their fish vendors, so they have to catch some small fish and shrimps to sell themselves. Although some goods are in sufficient supply, small vendors do not have the freedom to choose their purchases. Some state-owned wholesale stores forcibly match some defective, unsalable, and deteriorated products to small vendors. In larger towns, popular medium and high-grade biscuits are not allocated to distributors and sales agents. In rural fairs, however, they forcibly match the Zhonghua and Shuangxi brands of cigarettes, which are not suitable for rural consumption, to small vendors, forcing them to reduce prices for sales or match them to customers in the same way.

    The high starting point for wholesale also restricts the purchase of goods by small vendors. A soybean milk vendor in Chaozhou City was approved to buy 20 catties of soybeans, but the minimum wholesale quantity was 50 catties, forcing him to look for people to combine purchases in front of the grain bureau from morning to night, but he still couldn't find anyone. Small commodity vendors in Dabu County have to sell the needles they purchase wholesale at one time for two years.

    Purchase procedures are also too cumbersome. For example, every time a department store consignment store in Jieyang County purchases goods, it takes half a day to complete the cumbersome procedures.

    The shortage of funds is a common difficulty encountered by small vendors in their operations. Generally, small vendors reflect that banks "card" loans to small vendors too strictly! For example, loans have a certain ratio to their own working capital, the term is short, and the procedures are cumbersome. This makes it impossible for some small vendors who are indeed in financial difficulty to receive appropriate support. In the Xingmei area, the loan term for small vendors is only one month, and the bank urges repayment before the goods purchased with the loan are sold out. In the Zhanjiang area, some small vendors cannot get loans because they cannot find a guarantor. The total loan quota for Fangcheng County is only 8,000 yuan, and there is not much allocated to the towns.

        Unable to Obtain Reasonable Income

    A considerable portion of small vendors, whether organized or not, have less income than before. For distributors and sales agents, this is due to: on the one hand, business is shrinking, and on the other hand, reasonable and appropriate consideration cannot be given to wholesale and retail price differences, handling fees, and taxes. Under the guidance of the idea of "preferring low to high," some cadres generally set wholesale and retail price differences and handling fees lower than the original range set by the central commercial departments. The price difference for preserved meat in Xingning County is only 11.7%. The vendors said: After the preserved meat is purchased, the north wind blows away this price difference in two days! The gross profit of aquatic products in Wuhua County is 15%, but after deducting 5% to 10% for losses and about 3.5% for taxes, it is almost gone.

    In cooperative stores, most organized small vendors can maintain their lives or increase their income compared with the past, but some small vendors also have financial difficulties. The general reason is that the wages are too low, or the wages are fixed, and the family's auxiliary labor force has not been properly arranged, and the income has also decreased. There is a husband and wife store in Luogang District, Xingning County, that sells cigarettes and alcohol. When they were doing sales agency, they had a monthly turnover of 700 yuan and could also engage in some sideline businesses, and their lives were good. After joining the cooperative store, the couple's wages were only 40 yuan. In the past, they didn't need to hire a nanny, but now they have to; in the past, the family and the store were not separate, but now they have to rent a house, so the income of 40 yuan is not enough to maintain their lives.

    In terms of tax rates, the main problem is that the increase in turnover is less than the increase in taxes. After the cigarette, alcohol, and sundry goods industries in Donglang Township, a suburb of Guangzhou, were organized, the turnover increased by 23.18%, but the tax amount increased by 54.58%. This is because some merchants did not reach the tax threshold before, but now they have. Fish vendors in Chaoan, Chaoyang, Jieyang and other counties are allocated unsalable fish, and in order to avoid losses, they process it into salted fish, but they have to add a 5% "processing tax". The cost has increased, and the goods are even more difficult to sell.

          Unable to Cross Borders to Sell in Villages

    Due to the realization of agricultural cooperation in the province, new situations have emerged in the rural market. For example, after cooperation in Huiyang County, the attendance rate of farmers has increased, and the number of farmers going to the market has decreased by two-thirds. In Nanxiong County, only one-fifth of the farmers go to the market compared with the past. This change shows that it is necessary to organize more small vendors to go to the countryside to deliver goods in order to adapt to the new situation. The facts have also proved that the turnover of small vendors has increased and their income has also increased when this is done. For example, in late March, Heyuan County organized 322 small vendors to go to the countryside, and the turnover of twelve industries increased by 20% compared with mid-March. Since vendors delivered goods to the countryside in the agricultural cooperative of Andun District, Huiyang County, the time for members to go to the market has been greatly reduced, and the attendance rate has increased from 85.3% to 92.5%.

    However, this broad road has been blocked by artificial obstacles. Some commercial staff do not allow small vendors to conduct mobile sales and purchases across counties, districts, and towns between urban and rural areas and between regions according to their original business habits. The staff of the supply and marketing cooperative in Yaxian County said to the small vendors going to the countryside: "Your purchases will hinder us from completing the plan." After the road for cross-border sales was blocked, 764 small vendors in Foshan City who used to go to the countryside frequently had no way to go and could not maintain their lives.

    Those state-owned commercial departments that cannot solve the problem of goods supply for small vendors, for the sake of their own interests, do not allow or restrict vendors from purchasing goods from other places. Small commodity vendors in Nanxiong County took the initiative to request to purchase goods from other places, but the plan was reduced by 60%. State-owned commercial departments in Huilai County restricted vendors from purchasing goods from other places with cumbersome procedures, resulting in missed time and failure to buy goods.

  Current Measures

    The above-mentioned situations and practices have caused many small vendors throughout Guangdong Province to face difficulties in their business and life. It has also caused some small vendors to feel disappointed about the future. Some people say that the government "only wants meat (large commerce and large industry) and doesn't want bones (small vendors)." In order to solve this problem, Guangdong Province recently convened a provincial conference of small vendors. After research and discussion at the meeting, all the representatives of small vendors unanimously and warmly welcomed the principles and measures proposed by the party and government leading organs of Guangdong Province:

    In order to change the past situation of "no one managing" small vendors, in the future, the heads of joint ventures or cooperative stores will be designated to specifically lead the small vendors, and specialized wholesale stores will be established by professional companies (supply and marketing cooperatives), or a retail store will be designated as a sub-wholesale store to help small vendors solve the problem of funds, ensure the supply of goods, and handle tax collection on their behalf. In addition to resolutely correcting unreasonable phenomena such as mandatory matching and not allowing free selection of goods in some places, it also emphasizes paying attention to the supply of special commodities (such as small retail commodities), and giving appropriate consideration to popular commodities. In terms of wholesale and retail price differences and handling fees, we will resolutely change the practice of "preferring tight to loose". The originally set range of 18% to 25% only applies to large commodities. As for small commodities, it can and should exceed this range. The range can also exceed 25% for small commodities with slow turnover, large losses, and high labor costs. In addition to unified sales commodities, the handling fees for consignment commodities should be adjusted. Except for goods whose packaging is restricted and disassembly will cause undue losses, the restrictions on the minimum wholesale quantity will be cancelled, and the wholesale price will be supplied regardless of the quantity. The consignment deposit will also be relaxed, allowing goods to be taken on credit exceeding the deposit; individual small vendors with difficulties can also implement a credit consignment method of purchasing goods early and collecting money late. In terms of taxation, in addition to having state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives deduct and pay taxes on their behalf as much as possible to reduce the trouble of tax payment procedures, before the central government promulgates new methods, some temporary changes have also been appropriately made under the principle of preventing being too high or too low. The bank loan term will be one year. The wage problem of cooperative stores will be slightly higher than the current level, but will still be slightly lower than the wages of state-owned stores and cooperatives by 10% to 20%; those originally set higher will no longer be lowered. Some small vendors who have joined the cooperative store and whose income has decreased due to various reasons, and who resolutely request to withdraw, may be allowed to withdraw from the cooperative store. If they are willing to join a cooperative group, they can join, and they must not be discriminated against because of this.

    In short, these measures are all aimed at solving the difficulties of small vendors, helping small vendors expand their business operations, and ensuring that they obtain reasonable income. In this way, it is also to better give play to the enthusiasm of small vendors and their important role in commodity circulation, and to serve the cause of socialist construction.

    广东怎样解决小商小贩的当前困难
    本报记者　黄向青　吴尔祥
    在广东省许多城镇的小商小贩中，有人曾经认为前些时候对社会主义改造“鼓错了手掌”；有人用“合营合不上，货源供不上，贷款贷不上，淡季吃不上……”来形容他们当前的处境。有些小商小贩的处境确实是困难的。例如惠州镇已经组织起来的蔬菜食品商贩，家庭人口多的，收入已经难以维持原有的生活水平；未组织起来的，则有60％陷于半停业状态。据部分较有代表性的市场第一季度营业情况的调查：七个中级市场的营业额是逐月上升的，六个县城镇（初级市场）稍有下降，而分属于八个县的九个区的农村市场更是逐月下降。
    广东是一个商业比较发达的省份，小商小贩就有三十一万多户、四十三万多人，占了全省商业总户数的94.5％和商业营业总人数的82.6％。去年他们的营业额占全省商业总额的一半以上。他们像蜘蛛网一样遍布全省广大的地区，像千万条触须一样下伸到许多偏僻的乡村。在好些偏僻乡村里，没有他们，即使一针一线，或者一瓶救急的济众水，农民也得花上半天功夫，跑几十里来回才能买到。这说明了小商小贩在商品流转，在城乡人民经济生活中是不可缺少的。但是，为什么在热烈地接受改造而且社会主义觉悟和积极性正在逐步提高的时候，部分小商小贩中却出现了营业减退、甚至生活困难等不相称的现象呢？从最近广东省召开的全省小商小贩代表会议中以及会前各地反映的情况中，我们了解这跟没有贯彻执行“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针，跟一些国营和供销合作社商业工作人员对小商小贩实行“挤”和“压”的做法有关。
          货源和资金困难
    小商小贩经营的货物，在许多地区都有供应不上的现象。澄迈县脱销的大小日用必需百货已经达到117种。德庆县除小百货外，连常用的国药、成药也脱销了。佛山专区许多县的鱼贩买不到鱼，只好自己捕一些小鱼虾来卖。有些货物虽然货源充足，但是小商小贩没有选择进货的自由。有些国营批发店硬把一些残次品、滞销品、变质品搭配给小商小贩。在较大的市镇，不把畅销的中上等饼干配给经销代销户。在农村圩集，却硬把不合农村消费的中华牌、双喜牌香烟搭配给小商小贩，使他们不得不降价求售或者照样配搭给顾客。
    批发起点太高，也限制了小商小贩的进货。潮州市一个卖豆浆的小贩被批准购买黄豆二十斤，但是批发起点是五十斤，弄得他从早到晚在粮食局门口找人合并进货，结果还是找不到。大埔县的小百货商贩一次批来的针，要两年才能卖完。
    进货手续也太麻烦。如揭阳县百货业代销店每次采购货物，都得花上半天时间才能办完重重手续。
    资金短缺是小商小贩在经营上普遍遇到的困难。一般小商小贩反映：银行对小商小贩的贷款“卡”得太死太紧了！如贷款跟自有流动资金有一定比例，期限短，手续麻烦。这样，就使部分资金确实困难的小商小贩，得不到适当的支持。在兴梅专区，小商小贩贷款期限只有一个月，贷款进来的货还没有销完，银行就催还款。湛江专区有些小商小贩因为找不到担保，就无法贷款。防城全县贷款指标只有八千元，分配到镇便没有多少了。
        不能获得合理的收入
    无论是组织起来了的，或是还没组织起来的小商小贩，都有相当一部分的收入比以前少了。在经销代销商贩方面，这是由于：一方面营业萎缩，一方面在批零差价、手续费和税收上又得不到合理的适当照顾。在“就低不就高”的思想指导下，有些干部把批零差价、手续费普遍订得低于中央商业部门原定的幅度。兴宁县腊味的差价只有11.7％。商贩们说：腊味批回来，这差价，两天就让北风吹了！五华县水产的毛利是15％，除损耗5％至10％以及税收约3.5％外，差不多完了。
    在合作商店，多数组织起来了的小商贩可以维持生活或者比过去收入增加，但是也有一部分小商贩生活困难。一般原因是工资太低，有的是因为工资固定了，而家庭辅助劳动力没得到适当安排，收入也减少了。兴宁县罗岗区有一经营烟酒的夫妻店，经代销的时候每月有七百元营业额，还可以搞些副业，生活过得好。参加合作商店以后，夫妻两人工资只有四十元，过去不用请保姆，现在要请了；过去家店不分，现在要租房子住，因此四十元的收入便不够维持生活。
    在税率方面，主要是营业额增长的幅度小于税额增长的幅度。广州市郊东塱乡烟酒杂货业组织起来以后，营业额上升了23.18％，税额却上升了54.58％。这是因为以前有些商户没达到起征点，现在却达到了。潮安、潮阳、揭阳等县的鱼贩，配来了滞销的鱼货，为了避免损失，便加工制成咸鱼，却又要加征一项5％的“加工税”。成本提高了，货物就更加销不出去。
          不能跨境串乡
      由于农业合作化在全省的实现，农村市场出现了新的情况。比如惠阳县在合作化以后，农民出勤率提高了，上市赶集的农民减少了三分之二。南雄县赶集的农民只有过去的五分之一。这一变化，说明了必须更多地组织小商小贩串乡送货，才能适应新的情况。事实也证明了，凡是这样做的，小商小贩的营业额都上升了，收入也因而增加了。如河源县三月下旬，组织了322个小商贩下乡，其中十二个行业的营业额都比三月中旬上升了20％。惠阳县安墩区的农业合作社，自从商贩送货下乡以后，大大减少了社员赶集时间，出勤率便由85.3％增至92.5％。
    但是，这样一条宽阔的道路让人为的障碍阻塞了。一些商业工作人员，在城乡之间，地区之间，不准小商小贩按照原有的经营习惯跨县、跨区、跨镇进行流动销售和收购。崖县的供销合作社的工作人员对下乡的小商小贩说：“你们来收购，就会妨碍我们完成计划。”跨境串乡的道路被堵以后，佛山市过去经常下乡的764户小商小贩，都无路可走，生活无法维持。
    那些不能为小商小贩解决货源问题的国营商业部门，为了本单位利益打算，不准或限制商贩到外地进货。南雄县的小百货商贩主动要求到外地进货，但是计划被核减了60％。惠来县国营商业部门以麻烦的手续来限制了商贩向外地进货，结果时间误了，货又买不到。
  现在的措施
    上述这些情况和做法，就造成了当前广东全省许多小商小贩的营业和生活陷于困难的境地。而且还引起了部分小商小贩对前途感到失望。有些人说政府“只要肉（大商业、大工业），不要骨头（小商小贩）”。为了解决这个问题，广东省最近召开了全省小商小贩代表会议。经过会议的研究讨论，全体小商小贩代表一致热烈欢迎广东省党政领导机关提出的几项原则和措施：
    为了改变过去“无人管理”小商小贩的状况，今后将指定合营或合作商店的负责人具体领导小商小贩，并且由专业公司（供销社）建立专门批发商店，或者指定某一个零售商店作为代批店，帮助小商小贩解决资金问题，保证货源供应，代办税收。除了坚决纠正某些地方硬性配搭、不准自由选货等不合理现象之外，还强调注意特殊商品（如零星小商品）的供应，对畅销商品要适当照顾。在批零差价、手续费方面，坚决改变“就紧不就宽”的做法，原定18％至25％的幅度只适用于大商品，至于小商品，可以而且应当超过这个幅度。对周转慢、损耗大、花费劳动量较多的小商品，幅度还可以超过25％。除统销商品以外，对代销商品的手续费要进行调整。除了因为包装限制、拆散会引起不应有损失的货物外，取消批发起点的限制，无论多少，按批发价供应。代销保证金也将放宽，准许超押金要货；个别困难的小商小贩，还可以实行早进货晚回笼的信用代销办法。税收方面，除了尽可能由国营商业部门和供销合作社代扣代缴，以减少纳税手续麻烦之外，在中央未颁布新办法以前，在防止偏高偏低的原则下，也适当地作了一些暂时的改变。银行贷款期限将以一年为期。对于合作商店的工资问题，要比现在的略为提高，但是暂时仍略低于国营商店和合作社工资的10％至20％；原来订得高的则不再降低。有些参加了合作商店的小商贩，因为各种原因而致收入减少，本人坚决要求退出的，可以考虑准许退出合作商店，如果他们愿意参加合作小组，可以参加，并且不能因此而歧视他们。
    总之，这些措施都是为了解决小商小贩的困难，帮助小商小贩扩大经营业务，保证他们获得合理的收入。这样，也就是为了更好地发挥小商小贩的积极性和他们在商品流转中的重大作用，为社会主义建设事业服务。
