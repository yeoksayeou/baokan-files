    To Guizhou for Investigation of Minority Languages
    Xinhua News Agency News: The first group of members of the Central Minority Language Investigation Work Team to arrive in Guizhou left Guiyang on the 7th and went in groups to Miao and Buyi areas in 39 counties including Dushan and Huangping to conduct language investigation work. It is expected that a solution and writing system proposal for the writing problems of these two ethnic groups will be put forward this winter.
    Among the 3.9 million minority people in Guizhou Province, except for the Yi, Miao, and Shui nationalities which once had writing systems, other ethnic groups have no writing systems. Moreover, the existing writing systems are not commonly used in most areas within each ethnic group.

    到贵州调查少数民族语言
    新华社讯　第一批到达贵州的中央少数民族语言调查工作队队员，七日离开贵阳，分组前往独山、黄平等三十九个县的苗族、布依族地区，进行语言调查工作，预计在今年冬季对这两个民族的文字问题提出解决办法和文字方案。
    贵州省三百九十万少数民族人民除彝族、苗族、水家族曾经有过文字外，其他民族都没有文字，而已有的文字在各民族内部绝大多数地区也不能通用。
