The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xishan Coal Mine Committee recently held a meeting to conduct a preliminary inspection of the material and cultural life of the workers.

The comrades who attended the meeting revealed many shortcomings in the work. The most prominent problems were in wages and bonuses. For example, bonuses were extracted from wages, such as changing the wage for digging one cubic meter of rock from 4.30 yuan to 3.80 yuan, extracting 0.50 yuan as a bonus, which affected the workers' lives. The bonus system was untimely and unreasonable. Secondly, during operations, some workers encountered water leaks, and raincoats were issued after a long delay, resulting in illness and inability to guarantee attendance; drinking water was not guaranteed at some mine entrances. Problems with accommodation, food, and bathing were also very serious. Some couples were separated into male and female collective dormitories, but an inspection of 242 collective dormitories in the Baijiazhuang Mine revealed that they were generally not full. If properly adjusted, 25 rooms could be freed up for couples to live in. However, the responsible unit did not make adjustments, simply claiming "too many people, not enough rooms." At some canteens, it took an hour to queue for a meal; in order to reduce costs, canteen managers sometimes put rotten leeks in the food.

The comrades who attended the meeting deeply felt that although the lives of the workers had improved a lot compared to the past, these shortcomings seriously affected the further improvement of the workers' lives, and thus hindered the development of production. In order to make all work meet the requirements of production development, the meeting decided that within one month after the meeting, all units under the entire mining bureau should conduct a comprehensive inspection. The method is to organize cadres to go deep into workshops, dormitories, canteens, bathhouses, coal mining faces, and other sites to conduct visits and discussions, and solve problems as they are discovered. Finally, the problems will be systematically collected, solutions will be proposed, and a system will be established, which will be discussed by the masses and then implemented.

    中共西山煤矿委员会检查工资、住宿等工作
    中共西山煤矿委员会最近召开会议，对职工物质文化生活情况进行了初步检查。
    参加会议的同志揭发了工作中的许多缺点。其中工资、奖励方面问题最多。有的从工资中提取奖金，如把每打一立方石子的工资由四元三角改为三元八角，从中提取五角作为奖金，影响了工人的生活。奖励工作很不及时，又不合理。其次，在操作的时候，有的工人遇到淋头水，拖了很长时间才发雨衣，结果病倒了，不能保证出勤；有的坑口饮水没有保证。住宿、吃饭、洗澡等方面问题也很严重。有的夫妻分别去住男女集体宿舍，但是白家庄矿检查了242间集体宿舍，发现一般都没有住满，如果适当调整，还可以腾出二十五间房屋给夫妇居住。主管单位却不去调整，只是喊叫“人多房少”。有的食堂，吃一顿饭需要排队等一小时；食堂管理人员为了降低成本，有时把腐烂的韭菜放在食品里。
    参加会议的同志们都深深感到：职工生活虽然已经比过去好多了，但是这些缺点严重地影响了职工生活的进一步改善，因而也妨碍了生产的发展。为了使各项工作赶上生产发展的要求，会议决定在会后的一个月内，全矿务局所属单位要普遍进行一次检查。办法是组织干部深入车间、宿舍、食堂、澡塘、采煤工作面等现场，进行访问、座谈，边发现问题边解决。最后再系统地集中问题，提出解决办法，订成制度，经群众讨论后贯彻实行。
