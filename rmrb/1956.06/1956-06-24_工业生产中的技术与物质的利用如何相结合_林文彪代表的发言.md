　　I completely agree with Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget." Because this report reflects that both the national income plan and expenditure plan for this year are proactive. It is a report on our country's peaceful construction, seeking truth from facts, and striving to complete and overfulfill the national First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
　　Today, I would like to talk about "How to Combine Technology and Material Utilization in Industrial Production" from the perspective of responding to the country's call for a major advance in science, combined with my speech last year on "How to Rationally Use National Resources." In the past, in the entire industry of our country, from the perspective of the state's social material wealth, there was extreme waste. Many usable materials were discarded. The reasons for this situation are:
　　(1) Under the old social system, enterprise capitalists only considered how to obtain profits for their own enterprises and did not consider how to rationally use the entire country's materials and give greater effectiveness. Therefore, the raw materials used were mostly rare or more expensive raw materials for the convenience of their own enterprise's production, and simple production methods were adopted. The entire industry started from obtaining greater personal profits. Even in the old society, the semi-finished products used in production needed to be exported by our country, processed in foreign countries, and then returned to be manufactured into finished products. This kind of production only considered personal profits, causing great waste and loss to the country.
　　(2) In the past, many industries were privately operated. Due to their small scale, they were restricted by personal capital, equipment, technology, etc., and had no conditions to use the so-called waste generated by their own units to reproduce several products.
　　Now the situation in the new society is very different. The entire country's material resources and industry are in the hands of the people. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the concerted efforts of the people throughout the country, the situation mentioned above has undergone great changes in the past few years. However, the situation of wasting materials and failing to use them rationally still exists, so further thorough changes are needed. In the process of change, in line with the requirements of the state, all products produced must be of good quality, high output, and low price. Under this principle of "good, more, fast, and economical," to achieve rational use and give full play to the role of all materials in production, I think we should mainly start with technology. In principle, the following methods should be adopted:
　　(1) Continuously use raw materials for production. In the production process of many factories, in addition to the main products, the materials produced are known to be used for the reproduction of other products. However, due to inconvenient transportation and the inability of the unit to manufacture other products, they are often discarded as waste instead of being used. For example, a ammonium sulfate plant uses coke as a raw material and discharges a large amount of carbon dioxide gas. This gas is the raw material for manufacturing chemical medicines. Because it is not continuously used, it has to be discarded. For example, many smelting plants discharge a large amount of sulfur dioxide without using it. Paper mill waste can be fermented to produce alcohol, but it has not been well used now. The benzene used in the chemical industry is mostly used as fuel and is not used to manufacture other organic compounds. There are many similar wasteful situations, and every enterprise has them to varying degrees. In addition, many things are often the waste of one enterprise, or even harmful substances, but for another enterprise, they are a major raw material that is in great demand and indispensable. For example, methane in coal mines is a dangerous substance that is prone to explosion in the mine and affects the safety of workers. However, it is a valuable and indispensable raw material for the carbon black, which is greatly needed by the national defense rubber industry. Therefore, carbon black manufacturing plants should be established near mines with large amounts of gas to achieve the purpose of fully utilizing national resources.
　　(2) The situation of material control technology was very serious in the past, but this idea still exists. For example, the rubber industry requires improving the quality of products, and always uses the method of increasing the rubber content, instead of actively researching methods from a technical point of view. It is unreasonable to be completely controlled by raw materials. Therefore, in the future, we should rationally use production technology to master all usable materials in the country with technology. When manufacturing industrial products, we should fully consider how to give greater play to the use value of raw materials, and should not simply consider the convenience of the enterprise's production. Because often several different raw materials can produce the same product. For example, carbon black can be made from coal mine methane, but it can also be made from oil mine methane with the same quality. Therefore, when selecting raw materials, although it is more troublesome to obtain coal mine natural gas, it should still be fully used first, because oil mine natural gas contains raw materials for manufacturing synthetic rubber and other organic compounds. Therefore, in this case, when using it, we should consider manufacturing these organic compounds first, and then using the remaining waste gas to manufacture carbon black.
　　(3) Give full play to the enthusiasm of national science and technology workers and technical workers, and call on them to combine their work on their jobs on the road to a major advance in science to explore all usable materials. Gathering everyone's strength and working together in this direction will achieve greater results. Recently, on June 18, as seen in the newspaper, Tang Zucai and Zhan Liming from the Central Laboratory of the Ningchang Plant of the Yongli and Jiuda Companies, a joint state-private enterprise, studied the extraction of selenium that can be used to make semiconductors from the waste acid and waste acid sludge produced by the plant's sulfuric acid production. This is a very obvious example of the enterprise using its own strength and using the so-called waste of the plant to create wealth for the country (semiconductor selenium is needed by the telecommunications, metallurgy, glass, ceramics, rubber and other industries). This discovery is of great value to China's semiconductor scientific research. Therefore, the discovery of new usable materials is not limited to a few scientists, but requires all scientific and technical workers to work together, study diligently, and combine their work on their jobs when advancing towards science. In this way, I believe that many new people and new things will emerge, and can create more incalculable wealth for the country.
　　Now the country has established a technical committee, which is very good. For the utilization of the combination of technology and national materials, and the role of all usable materials, it is recommended that the technical committee be responsible for this work. In this way, the state can have a unified grasp of all usable materials, and can comprehensively consider and make rational applications to produce products with good quality and low prices, so that production technology and all national materials are combined to create conditions for the country to accumulate more funds.
　　The Technical Committee should combine the country's materials, technology, social needs, and production possibilities with each other. Therefore, I suggest that the following specific measures must be taken:
　　(1) Require all enterprises to report to the Technical Committee on the by-products and the so-called waste of the enterprise in production, as well as the raw materials, process flow, and production methods used in the production of main products. After the Technical Committee fully grasps this information, it is convenient to consider the overall situation and suggest the plant construction areas that new enterprises should choose, and suggest the source of raw materials and production and manufacturing methods that each enterprise should choose.
　　(2) For the use of the so-called waste of the enterprise, if the materials are not easy to preserve and difficult to transport, and the enterprise needs to solve the problem locally and continuously produce and process them into raw materials that can be used by other enterprises, and there are technical difficulties, it should vigorously assist and promote the relevant departments to provide direct technical assistance. The Technical Committee can also propose requirements for improvement to the enterprises that produce this raw material based on the technical requirements of the enterprises that use the raw material.
　　(3) All raw materials that the country already has, even if the technology cannot be solved now and there are no conditions for application, must also be fully grasped. For example, naphthalene and anthracene, the products of the coal coking industry, are raw materials for the manufacture of dyes, but due to the current technical conditions and insufficient industrial development, they cannot be well utilized rationally. It is unreasonable to abandon them and only use them to manufacture carbon black. When industrial development reaches a certain level in the future, they should be used to manufacture organic compounds.
　　In general, each enterprise should be required to report to the Technical Committee on what raw materials are used, what products and other by-products are produced, and what so-called waste cannot be used by the enterprise. At the same time, the enthusiasm and creativity of production technology workers in each enterprise should be mobilized, and everyone's strength and wisdom should be gathered to conduct a comprehensive scientific advance towards all potentially usable materials and the so-called waste of each enterprise. The Technical Committee will then make comprehensive plans, strengthen leadership, and make unified arrangements based on China's technical level, manpower, materials, needs, and other conditions, and take local conditions into consideration to achieve good product quality, high output, and low prices. It is recommended that each production enterprise appropriately adopt resources, link up the use of materials, comprehensively organize production, and assist production technology workers in fully utilizing all usable materials in China, so that they can exert the greatest use efficiency, so that "materials are not wasted on the ground," or any waste. In this way, combining science and technology with all potentially usable materials, from the perspective of the entire national production, will not only save money, but also create wealth. Saving is good, but creating wealth is even better, in order to accumulate more funds for the country and increase the speed of socialist industrialization.

    工业生产中的技术与物质的利用如何相结合
    ——林文彪代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”。因为这个报告反映出今年国家收入计划和支出计划都是积极的，它是我国和平建设、实事求是和争取提前和超额完成国家第一个五年计划的报告。
    今天我想从响应国家向科学大进军这一号召下来结合我去年的发言“如何合理地使用国家资源”方面谈一下“工业生产中的技术与物质的利用如何相结合的问题”。过去在我国整个工业中，从国家社会物质财富上来看，存在着极大的浪费，许多可利用的物质均被抛弃。产生这种情况的原因是：
    （1）在旧社会制度下，企业资本家只为了本企业获得利润而根本不考虑整个国家物质如何合理使用，发挥更大效能的问题。因而所用的原料多是为便利本企业生产，利用稀少或者较贵的原料，采用简陋的生产方法进行生产，整个工业是从获得个人更大的利润出发。甚至在旧社会里，形成生产中所用的半成品，需由我国将原料输出在外国加工后再返回来制造成品。这样的生产就是只顾个人利润，给国家造成很大的浪费和损失。
      （2）过去许多工业都是私人经营，由于规模小，所以受到个人资本、设备、技术等的限制，没有条件利用本单位所产生的所谓废物，再生产几种产品。
    现在新社会的情况已大不相同了，整个国家的物质资源和工业都掌握在人民的手里，而几年来由于党和政府的正确领导，在全国人民一致的努力下，上面所谈的情况已有了很大的改变。但是，浪费物质，没有得到合理应用的情况还是存在着，因此还需要进一步彻底改变。在改变过程中，应结合国家要求，所生产的一切产品要质量好，产量大，而且价格便宜。在这个“又好、又多、又快、又省”原则下，要达到合理使用和发挥一切物质在生产中的作用，我认为主要应该从技术上着手。在原则上应采用下面几个方法：
      （1）连续使用原材料进行生产。很多工厂在生产过程中除主要产品外，所产生出来的物质虽然知道可以用来再生产其他产品，但是由于运输不方便，而本单位又无能力用以制造其他产品时，常常作为废物抛弃，而不加以利用。如硫酸錏厂以焦炭为原料，排出大量二氧化碳气体，而这种气体正是制造化学药品的原料，因为没有连续使用不得不丢弃。又如许多冶炼厂将大量二氧化硫排出，而没有利用。纸厂的废料可再经过发酵制造酒精，现在也没有得到很好的使用。化学工业用的苯，现在多是当做燃料用，而没有用以制造其他有机化合物。类似这样的浪费情况是很多的，每个企业或多或少都有的。另外，有许多的东西常常是本企业的废物，甚至是有害物，然而对另外一个企业又是需要量大而不可缺少的主要原料。例如煤矿中的沼气是一种在矿井中容易发生爆炸，影响工人安全的危险物质，然而它对制造国防橡胶工业上所大量需要的炭黑，却是一种宝贵不可少的原料，因此在瓦斯量大的矿山的附近即应建立炭黑制造厂，以达到充分利用国家资源的目的。
      （2）物质控制技术的情况过去很严重，但现在这种思想还依然存在，如橡胶工业要求提高制品质量，总是采用提高含胶量的办法，而不积极从技术上研究设法解决，完全受原材料支配是不合理的。因此，在今后应合理使用生产技术，作到以技术掌握国家一切可利用的物质。在制造工业产品的时候，应该充分考虑如何更大的发挥原料使用价值，而不应只单纯考虑本企业生产上的便利。因为往往几种不同的原料能制出同样的产品来。例如，炭黑可以以煤矿沼气为原料，但同样也可以用油矿的沼气来制造出质量相同的炭黑来。因此在选用原料时，虽然煤矿天然气获取比较麻烦，但是也应该首先充分使用，因为油矿天然气含有制造人造橡胶及其他有机化合物的原料。所以，在这种情况下，使用时应该考虑在完成制造这些有机化合物后，再利用剩余的废气制造炭黑。
    （3）发挥全国科学技术工作者、技术工人的积极性，号召他们向科学进军这一道路上，结合本工作岗位上的工作，来发掘一切可利用的物质。这样集合大家力量，共同向这一个方向努力，将会有更大的成绩。最近6月18日在报纸上所看到的，公私合营永利、久大公司宁厂中央试验室汤祖裁与詹黎明研究从本厂生产硫酸产生的废酸和废酸泥渣中，提取能造半导体的硒，就是本企业发挥自己力量，利用该厂所谓的废物为国家创造财富的很明显的例子（半导体硒为电讯、冶金、玻璃、陶瓷、橡胶等工业所需要）。这一发现，对我国进行半导体科学研究工作有极大的价值。所以，发掘新的可利用物质，不只是限于几个科学家，而是需要全体科学工作者、技术工人在向科学进军时，结合本岗位的工作共同努力，刻苦钻研。这样，我相信将会出现许许多多新人物、新事物来，能为国家创造无法计算的更多财富。
    现在国家已经成立技术委员会，这是非常好的，对于技术与国家物质相结合的利用，发挥一切可利用物质的作用，这个工作建议由技术委员会负责进行。这样国家可以统一掌握一切可利用的物质，能够全面的考虑作到合理应用，生产出质量好而价格又便宜的产品，使生产技术与国家一切物质相结合起来，为国家积累更多的资金创造条件。
    技术委员会应该作到将国家的物质、技术、社会需要和生产的可能性彼此相结合起来，因此我建议必须采取以下几点具体办法：
    （1）要求各企业向技术委员会报告本企业生产中的副产品及产生的该企业所谓的废物，以及生产主要产品所采用的原料、工艺过程和生产方法。技术委员会充分掌握这些资料以后，便于统一整体考虑，并建议新建企业应选择的建厂地区，建议各企业所应选用的原料来源和生产制造方法。
    （2）对于利用该企业所谓的废物，如果不易保存和运输困难的物质，需要本企业就地解决连续生产加工制成其他企业可使用的原料而在技术上有困难时，应该大力协助，并且推动有关部门，给以技术上的直接帮助。技术委员会还可以根据使用该原料的企业，对原料的技术要求向生产这种原料的企业提出要求改进。
    （3）对现在技术还不能解决，尚无条件应用，而国家已有的原料也要全部掌握。如煤焦工业的产物萘和蒽是制造染料的原料，但由于目前技术条件和工业发展不够，还不能很好的作到合理利用。为避免抛弃仅用来制造炭黑，这是不合理的。将来工业发展，达到一定程度条件时，就应该采用制造有机化合物。
    总的，要求各企业用何原料，产生那一种产品和其他副产品，以及本企业不能利用的所谓废物，都应该上报技术委员会，同时发动各企业生产技术工作者的积极性与创造性，集合大家的力量与智慧向一切可能利用的物质，与所谓各企业的废物作全面的科学大进军。而技术委员会则根据我国技术水平、人力、物力、需要情况等全面规划，加强领导，统一安排，因地制宜和考虑达到产品的质量好、产量大而价格又便宜。建议各生产企业适当采用资源、联动使用物质，综合组织生产协助生产技术工作者充分利用我国一切可利用的物质，使其发挥最大的使用效能，不至“物废于地”，或任何浪费。这样，结合科学技术与一切可能利用的物质，对全国整个生产来看，非独节约，且能致富，节约是好的，而致富是更好的，来为国家积累更多的资金，提高社会主义工业化的速度。
