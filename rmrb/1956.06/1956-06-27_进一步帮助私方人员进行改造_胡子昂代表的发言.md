    Further Help Private Personnel to Reform
    ——Speech by Representative Hu Ziang
    I completely agree with and endorse all the reports and explanations of this conference, and I express my heartfelt congratulations on our country's successful implementation of the 1955 budget, the further stabilization of the financial and economic foundation, and the rapid advancement of socialist construction. Now, I would like to offer some of my personal experiences regarding the reform of private personnel in joint public-private enterprises at their work posts.
    After the overall public-private partnership of industries, many private personnel, under the leadership of the public side and with the help of employees, are working actively and diligently in their new work posts, and have made certain achievements in production and operation. However, there are still a considerable number of private personnel who do not have a sufficient understanding of their position in joint ventures and the attitude they should have. They adopt a passive and dependent attitude towards the production and operation of the enterprise, are constrained and dare not take bold responsibility, and do not actively contribute their talents. The continued existence of this situation will inevitably affect the further improvement of production and operation, and will also hinder the self-reform of private personnel, which is detrimental to the cause of socialism. Therefore, in joint ventures, further helping private personnel to earnestly reform in their work posts is a very important task at present.
    The work of uniting and reforming private personnel needs to be approached from many aspects, and properly handling public-private relations is an important link in doing this work well. Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out in his speech: "In a large number of joint public-private enterprises, the issue of whether the representatives of the public and private sectors work well together is a major issue related to the production and operation of the enterprise, and it is also an important issue related to whether the role of the capitalists can be brought into play in production and whether the capitalists can be effectively reformed into laborers." From my personal experience in work over the past few years, I can roughly draw the following preliminary conclusion: Those who strengthen the leadership of the public side, work in many ways, and have good relations, and the private personnel can take the initiative to actively strive for the leadership of the public side, then they are reformed better; otherwise, they are reformed worse. Therefore, I believe that the public side in joint ventures, in addition to attaching importance to the learning of private personnel and organizing them to participate in various political and current affairs studies, can consider strengthening work in the following aspects:
    First, strengthening the work of uniting, educating, and reforming private personnel is an old saying, but how to strengthen it requires the unified leadership of the Party within the enterprise, mobilizing the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and closely contacting relevant organizations such as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, to cooperate in doing work in all aspects, to jointly manage relations well, and to implement the policy of uniting and reforming private personnel. At present, many public parties in joint ventures have taken effective measures in this regard and have achieved good results. For example, the public side of Chongqing Huazhong Machine Factory found that some workers did not pay enough attention to private administrative personnel, and were unwilling to accept the guidance of private technical personnel, so they suggested that the trade union strengthen education; at the same time, they invited private personnel to a forum to listen to private opinions on the workers, and then solicited the opinions of the employees, cross-examined each other, and took effective measures to solve them in a timely manner. The trade union of this factory also invited private personnel to a forum to tell them about the nature and tasks of the trade union. The private personnel were greatly encouraged and were willing to create conditions for participating in the trade union, which increased their enthusiasm for work. When the children of private employees in the factory were not at ease with their work, the Youth League branch sent people to understand their situation and dispel their concerns so that they could settle down. In addition, in order to cultivate and expand the core force of private progress within the enterprise, it also helped the China Democratic National Construction Association to appropriately develop its organization; and through the progressive private side to help other private sides. There are a total of 23 private employees in this factory, and 18 of them are old technical personnel for many years. After the joint venture, they were all arranged in important positions for technical guidance. Because the relevant forces were mobilized and relied on the leadership of the Party to jointly unite and transform, they dedicated their strength and achieved due results.
    Second, according to the expertise and different talents of private personnel, let them work freely, implement division of labor and responsibility, encourage them to work boldly, earnestly achieve that they have positions and powers, and at the same time, when discovering their shortcomings in work and thought, they should promptly launch criticism. For example, a private deputy director of a public-private joint venture in Chongqing is indeed specialized in technology, and the public side boldly used him, handing over the production scheduling work of the entire factory to him, and also told him the tasks assigned by the superior business authorities. He felt the trust and importance of the country in them, actively took on this task, and did a good job, and also took the initiative to formulate work plans, which strengthened the planning of production. This method can play a very good role in cultivating and improving the working ability of private personnel and encouraging their enthusiasm. However, letting them work freely must also correct their shortcomings in work at any time and launch necessary criticisms. A considerable number of private personnel are unanimously asking the public side and employees to criticize, but when they are really criticized, they will blush and cannot stand criticism, so some public sides feel very embarrassed in order to take care of their emotions. We believe that the public-private relationship in joint ventures is a relationship of leadership and being led, and it is also a relationship of gradually transforming into comrades working together. Criticism is to correct mistakes, improve work, and better strengthen unity, so criticism is necessary. We must regard the phenomenon of not being able to withstand criticism as an inevitable process that is inevitable at the beginning of criticism; blushing is just blushing, and criticism must still be criticized. Criticism is not only for the private side, but also to inspire the responsible personnel of the private side to dare to criticize the public side, and gradually get used to being close to the public side and sincerely accepting the education and help of the public side. We cannot give up criticism because the private side cannot accept criticism. In public-private joint ventures, criticism is a weapon to reform private personnel, and it must not be abandoned at any time.
    Third, care about the lives of private personnel and try to closely connect public-private relations. Caring about the lives of private personnel and providing appropriate care seems to be a trivial matter, but it often gives private personnel a great education. A joint venture in Chongqing, when organizing employees' children to be vaccinated with BCG in the past, the trade union did not notify the children of private personnel. The private personnel were very stimulated. After the trade union noticed this, they treated them equally. The private personnel and their families were very happy. In the past, private personnel did not go to the trade union recreation room in the factory. Now, with the welcome of the trade union, they also go to the recreation room to play chess and cards with the employees at any time, and they feel very happy. The public side of the factory often looks for private personnel after work to solicit their opinions on themselves, and at the same time, promptly points out their shortcomings in work and thought and patiently helps them. These practices make the private personnel feel the closeness of the relationship between the public and private sectors and the comrade-like care, and feel the deep warmth of the joint venture for them, so they cannot help but be sincerely moved and work hard.
    We want to do a good job in the transformation of private personnel in joint ventures. What I have said above is only one aspect. The other more important aspect depends on the efforts of the private personnel themselves. If you simply rely on the leadership of the public side and do not take an active and positive attitude, it is difficult to be transformed. Recently, I inspected the Chongqing Public-Private Joint Venture Zhongnan Rubber Factory. A private person in this factory served as the director of the miscellaneous parts workshop. The task was very heavy; but at the beginning of the joint venture, he held the attitude that it is better to do less than more, and he was extremely irresponsible in his work, and he thought that he had a set of technologies, looked down on the workers, and the workshop production was very bad. The masses added the title of "waste product workshop" to it, which simply became the "dead corner" of the factory. Later, with the patient help of the public side, the trade union, and the Party organization, he exposed his true thoughts and expressed his willingness to strive for progress. Recently, after the labor competition was launched in the factory, he actively participated in the competition with the workers, set plans, found ways, and improved production technology. First, he eliminated the waste products, and the product quality gradually improved, and he completed the task 100%. All three groups in the workshop successively won the championship. The waste product workshop became a winning workshop and became a banner in the factory's labor competition. In the past, the workers had a bad impression of him, did not pay attention to him, and did not greet him when they saw him. Now, when he arrives at the workshop, everyone calls him "Director, Director..." If there is a problem in production, they kindly ask him to help solve it. On the contrary, another private person in this factory who served as the deputy director of the workshop, relying on some technology, served as the deputy director of the workshop, but did not go to the workshop, and sat in the office all day, not approaching the workers; and saw another private technician in the same factory, not afraid of hardship, automatically worked overtime on Sundays to improve the tools, and had to ridicule and attack him. All parties in the factory had many opinions on this deputy director, and the work in this workshop also suffered considerable losses. The above two examples show that as long as private personnel work actively and strive to contribute their talents, they can get the support and help of the public side and the masses of employees, and they can also be better transformed; if they take the opposite attitude, it will not only be detrimental to the production and operation of the enterprise, but also seriously hinder their own transformation.
    Dear representatives, doing a good job in uniting and transforming private personnel is a complex, meticulous, and arduous task, and it is also a task of extremely important significance. We should explore experience, improve our work, and find a set of effective methods from the specific practice of this work, so as to promote this work of uniting and transforming the bourgeoisie, which has world-historical significance, from victory to greater and complete victory.

    进一步帮助私方人员进行改造
    ——胡子昂代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护这次大会的各项报告和说明，并为我们的国家胜利地执行了1955年的预算，财政经济基础更加稳定，社会主义建设事业突飞猛进，表示衷心的祝贺。现在，我就公私合营企业中私方人员在工作岗位上的改造问题，提出我个人的一些体会。
    全行业公私合营后，许多私方人员在公方的领导和职工的帮助下，都正在新的工作岗位上，积极努力的工作，在生产经营上做出了一定的成绩；但是也还有相当的一部分私方人员，对于自己在合营企业中的地位和应有的态度认识不够，对待企业的生产经营，采取了消极依赖等被动态度，束手束脚，不敢大胆负责，没有主动积极地贡献出自己的才能。这种情况的继续存在，必然会影响生产经营的进一步提高和改进，也妨害了私方人员自身的改造，这是不利于社会主义事业的。因此，在合营企业中，进一步帮助私方人员在工作岗位上认真进行改造，是当前十分重要的一项工作。
    团结和改造私方人员的工作，需要从多方面着手，而正确处理公私关系，则是做好这个工作的一个重要环节。陈云副总理在发言中指出：“在大量的公私合营企业中，公私双方的代表共事得好或者不好的问题，是关联到企业生产经营的一个大问题，也是关联到能否发挥资方人员在生产中的作用和能否有效地把资方人员改造成为劳动者的重要问题。”从个人几年来在工作中的体验来看，大体上可以得出这样的初步结论：凡是公方加强领导，从多方面进行工作，搞好关系，私方人员又能主动积极争取公方领导的，那就改造得较好；反之，就改造得较差。所以，我认为合营企业中的公方，除了应该重视私方人员的学习，组织他们参加各种政治和时事学习以外，可以考虑从以下几个方面来加强工作：
    第一、加强对私方人员的团结、教育、改造工作，这是一句老话，但是如何加强，要在企业内部党的统一领导下，动员工会、青年团，密切联系工商联和民建会等有关组织，通力合作，从各方面来做工作，共同搞好关系，贯彻对私方人员的团结改造的政策。目前，不少合营企业的公方在这方面采取了有效的办法，已经取得了良好的效果。例如，重庆华中机器厂的公方，发现有些工人对私方行政人员重视不够，对私方技术人员的指导不愿接受，就建议工会加强教育；同时又邀请私方人员座谈，倾听私方对工人的意见，然后再去征询职工的意见，相互对证，分别采取有效措施，及时加以解决。这个厂的工会还邀请私方人员座谈，向他们讲述工会的性质和任务，私方人员受到很大的鼓舞，都愿为参加工会创造条件，这就增加了他们的工作劲头。遇到厂内从业的私方子女不安心工作时，团支部就派人去了解他们的情况，解除他们的顾虑，使他们能够安心下来。此外，为了培养和扩大企业内私方进步核心力量，还帮助民建会适当发展组织；并通过进步的私方去帮助其他的私方。这个厂的私方从业人员共23人，有18位都是多年老技术人员，合营后都安排在技术指导的重要岗位上，由于动员了有关力量，依靠党的领导共同团结改造，因此献出了他们的力量，获得了应有的成效。
    第二、按照私方人员的专长和不同才能，放手使用，实行分工负责，鼓励他们大胆工作，认真做到有职有权，同时发现他们工作中和思想上的缺点，应该及时地展开批评。例如，重庆一家公私合营厂的一位私方副厂长，在技术上确有专长，公方就大胆使用，把全厂的生产调度工作交给他负责，同时把上级业务主管部门布置的任务，也告诉他，他感到国家对他们的信任和重视，积极地把这个任务担当起来，工作搞得很好，还主动订立作业计划，加强了生产的计划性。这样的办法，对于培养和提高私方人员的工作能力和鼓励他们的积极性，都能起到很好的作用。但是放手让他们工作，也必须随时纠正他们工作中的缺点，展开必要的批评。有相当多的私方人员，都是异口同声地要求公方和职工批评，但真正批评起来就要红脸，经不起批评，因而有的公方为了照顾情绪，感到很不好办。我们认为，合营企业中的公私关系是领导与被领导的关系，同时也是逐步转变为共同工作的同志关系。批评是为了纠正错误，改进工作，更好地加强团结，因此，批评是必要的。我们要把经不起批评的现象，看成是开始批评所不可避免的必经过程；红脸只管红脸，批评还得批评。批评不是专对私方，也可同时启发私方的负责人员敢于向公方提出批评，并逐渐习惯于同公方亲近，忠诚的接受公方教育帮助。不能因为私方不能接受批评，公方就放弃批评。在公私合营企业中，批评就是改造私方人员的一个武器，任何时
  候都不可离开。
      第三、关心私方人员的生活，尽量密
  切公私关系。对私方人员生活上的关心和
  适当的照顾，看起来是很琐细的事情，但往往给予私方人员以很大的教育。重庆有家合营厂，过去在组织职工的子女接种卡介苗时，工会没有通知私方人员的子女，私方人员很受刺激，工会注意到这一点后，就一视同仁，私方人员和他们的家属都非常高兴。过去私方人员是不进厂里的工会文娱室去的，现在，在工会的欢迎下，他们也随时到文娱室里和职工一块下棋、玩牌，感到非常愉快。厂的公方在工余之后，经常找私方人员，征求私方人员对自己的意见，同时，对私方人员在工作中和思想上的缺点及时指出，耐心帮助。这些作法都使私方人员感到公私之间关系的亲密和同志一样的关怀，感到合营企业对他们有着深厚的温暖，因而，不能不由衷地感动，努力做好工作。
    我们要做好合营企业中私方人员的改造工作，上面所讲的，还只是一个方面。更主要的另一个方面还要靠私方人员自身的努力。如果单纯地依赖公方领导，自己不采取主动积极的态度，也很难得到改造。最近，我视察了重庆公私合营中南橡胶厂，这个厂的一位私方人员担任杂件车间的主任，任务很繁重；但在合营之初，他则抱着多一事不如少一事的态度，工作极不负责，又自认为在技术上他有一套，瞧不起工人，车间生产弄得很糟，群众都给它加上“废品车间”的称号，简直成了厂里的
  “死角”。后来，经过公方、工会、党组织的耐心帮助，他暴露了真实的思想，表示愿意争取进步。最近厂内劳动竞赛展开后，同工人一道积极投入竞赛，定计划，想办法，改进生产技术，首先消灭了废品，产品质量逐步提高，百分之百完成了任务，全车间3个小组都先后得到了优胜，废品车间变成了优胜车间，成了全厂劳动竞赛中的一面旗帜。过去工人对他的印象不好，不重视他，看见他也不招呼。现在，他一到车间，大家都叫他“主任，主任……”生产上一有问题就亲切地去请他帮助解决。相反的，就在这个厂里的另一位担任车间副主任的私方人员，自恃有一些技术，担任车间副主任，却不到车间，整天坐在办公室里，不接近工人；而且看见同厂的另一位私方技术人员，不辞劳苦，星期天自动加班改进工具，还要加以讥讽和打击，厂里各方面对这位副主任的意见都很多，在这个车间的工作上也遭到了相当的损失。从以上这两个事例说明，私方人员只要积极工作，努力贡献自己的才能，就能得到公方和职工群众的支持和帮助，自己也能更好地得到改造；如果采取相反的态度，不仅不利于企业的生产经营，而且也严重地妨碍了自身的改造。
    各位代表，做好团结和改造私方人员的工作，是一项复杂的、细致的艰巨工作，也是一项具有极为重要意义的任务，我们应该从这一工作的具体实践中来摸索经验，改进工作，找出一套行之有效的方法，以便把这一具有世界历史意义的团结和改造资产阶级分子的工作，从胜利推向更大
  的彻底的胜利。
