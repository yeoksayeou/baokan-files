Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th - According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong: At the Korean Military Armistice Commission meeting held on June 4th, Major General Zheng Guolu, chief member of the Korean and Chinese side, pointed out that the US side's arbitrary action of unilaterally deciding to abolish the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams was illegal and seriously violated the letter and spirit of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Zheng Guolu clearly pointed out that this unilateral decision by the US side is completely invalid; if the US side does not immediately withdraw the unilateral statement regarding the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams withdrawing from South Korea within a week, the US side will bear all responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

Major General Zheng Guolu, based on undeniable facts and relevant records, exposed and condemned the US side for continuously violating the Armistice Agreement by transporting a large amount of reinforcements and combat materials to arm the South Korean army since the armistice, and for employing and still employing various sabotage methods to attempt to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He also lodged a strong protest. Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out that the mask worn by the United States when the Lee Seung-man (Syngman Rhee) clique, at the instigation of the US government, took barbaric provocative actions against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission last August, has now been completely removed.

Major General Zheng Guolu then said that the governments of Korea and China, in order to guarantee the Korean Armistice Agreement, and taking into account the actual difficulties of the Swedish and Swiss governments, agreed to the Swedish government's proposal of March 10, 1956, regarding the temporary withdrawal of inspection teams stationed at designated ports as a temporary measure, as long as the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission retains the power to re-dispatch inspection teams to each designated port.

Major General Zheng Guolu emphasized that under the circumstances that the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea, especially the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, has not been resolved, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must continue to perform the tasks assigned to it by the Armistice Agreement. He continued that the temporary measures suggested by the Swedish government do not change the task and organization of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in supervising the implementation of the armistice, according to the Armistice Agreement.

At the same time, the US side should bear the responsibility to actively cooperate with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the future, according to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, so that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can continue to play its role in supervising the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The US side rejected this legitimate and reasonable proposal from the Korean and Chinese side at the meeting.

Zheng Guolu said that because the US side insisted on its unreasonable attitude, the Korean and Chinese side will separately notify the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the attitude and opinions of the Korean and Chinese side.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th - According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency on the 4th: Major General Zheng Guolu, chief member of the Korean and Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, wrote to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the 4th, saying that the Korean and Chinese side, taking into account the current situation and the actual difficulties of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission caused by the United Nations Command side, agrees to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission implementing the proposal made by the Swedish government on March 10, 1956, regarding the temporary withdrawal of the inspection teams from specific ports. At the same time, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has the right to re-dispatch these teams to each specific port.

The letter emphasized that this temporary measure is in line with the basic spirit of the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement. This does not change the responsibilities and organization of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in supervising the implementation of the Armistice Agreement. The United Nations Command side has the responsibility to actively assist the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, according to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, so that it can continue to carry out the task of supervising the implementation of the Korean armistice.

Zheng Guolu emphasized in the letter that the United Nations Command side's unilateral announcement on May 31 that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams must withdraw from South Korea within a week is another serious violation of the Armistice Agreement by the United Nations Command side. This is completely illegal and invalid.

Although the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has always been subjected to various obstacles from the United Nations Command side since its establishment, it has played and is playing an active role in supervising the implementation of the Korean armistice.

Under the circumstances that the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea, especially the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, has not been resolved due to the opposition of the United Nations Command side, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must continue to perform the tasks assigned to it by the Armistice Agreement.

The letter finally said, "Our side firmly demands, and will continue to demand, that the United Nations Command side fulfill its responsibility to assist the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in continuing to supervise the armistice. Our side will, of course, as before, always respect and support the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its members, and provide full assistance."

### 朝中方面认为在和平统一朝鲜问题未解决以前  中立国监察委员会必须继续执行任务  同意从特定口岸撤回中立国视察小组作为暂时的措施

    朝中方面认为在和平统一朝鲜问题未解决以前
    中立国监察委员会必须继续执行任务
    同意从特定口岸撤回中立国视察小组作为暂时的措施
    据新华社平壤5日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将在六月四日举行的朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上指出，美方片面决定废除中立国视察小组的武断行动是非法的，严重违反了朝鲜停战协定的文字和精神。郑国禄明确指出，美方这一片面决定是完全无效的；如果美方不立即撤销关于要中立国视察小组在一周内撤出南朝鲜的片面声明，美方要对由此引起的一切后果承担全部责任。
    郑国禄少将根据不容置辩的事实和有关记录，对美方自从停战以来不断违反停战协定运进大量增援作战物资武装南朝鲜军队，以及曾经运用、现在还正在运用各种破坏手段图谋取消中立国监察委员会的行为进行了揭发和谴责，并且提出了强硬抗议，郑国禄少将指出，美国在李承晚集团受美国政府的怂恿在去年八月对中立国监察委员会采取野蛮的挑衅行动的时候所带的假面具，现在完全揭去了。
    郑国禄少将接着说，朝中两国政府为了保障朝鲜停战协定，同时考虑到瑞典政府和瑞士政府的实际困难，同意瑞典政府1956年3月10日提出的关于暂时撤走驻在指定口岸的视察小组的建议作为当前一项暂时措施，只要中立国监察委员会保有再派遣视察小组到每一个指定口岸的权力。
    郑国禄少将强调说，在和平统一朝鲜问题，特别是一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题还没有解决的情况下，中立国监察委员会必须继续执行停战协定交给它的任务。他继续说，瑞典政府建议的临时措施并不改变根据停战协定监督停战实施情况的中立国监察委员会的任务和组织。
    同时，美方应当承担责任，根据停战协定的规定在将来同中立国监察委员会积极合作，以使中立国监察委员会能够继续发挥监督朝鲜停战协定实施情况的作用。
    美方在会议上拒绝了朝中方面的这个正当合理的建议。
    郑国禄说，由于美方坚持它的没有理由的态度，朝中方面将单独通知中立国监察委员会关于朝中方面的态度和意见。
    新华社平壤5日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社四日消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将四日写信给中立国监察委员会说，朝中方面考虑到目前形势和联合国军方面所造成的中立国监察委员会的实际困难，同意中立国监察委员会实行瑞典政府在1956年3月10日提出的关于暂时撤回特定口岸的视察小组。同时，中立国监察委员会有权把这些小组再派遣到每个特定口岸这一建议。
    信中强调指出，这一暂定措施是符合停战协定有关条款的基本精神的。这不是变更中立国监察委员会监督停战协定实行情况的职责和组织的。联合国军方面有责任根据停战协定的规定，积极协助中立国监察委员会，使它能够继续执行监督朝鲜停战实行的任务。
    郑国禄在信中着重指出，联合国军方面五月三十一日片面宣布中立国视察小组要在一星期内撤出南朝鲜的行为，是联合国军方面又一个严重违反停战协定的行为。这是完全非法的，也是无效的。
    虽然中立国监察委员会从它成立初期起，一向遭到联合国军方面的各种阻碍，但是它在监督朝鲜停战实行情况的工作中，起了和起着积极的作用。
    在朝鲜的和平统一问题、特别是一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题，由于联合国军方面的反对而没有得到解决的情况下，中立国监察委员会必须继续执行停战协定所赋予它的任务。
    这封信最后说，我方坚决要求，今后也要继续要求联合国军方面履行协助中立国监察委员会继续执行监督停战的责任。我方当然是像从前一样，也将始终一贯尊重和支持中立国监察委员会和它的成员的工作，并且提供给充分的协助。
