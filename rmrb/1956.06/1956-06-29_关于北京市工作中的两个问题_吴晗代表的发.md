I fully agree with Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan's report on the model articles of association (draft) for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee. I would now like to express some opinions on the following two issues: (1) the employment of unemployed and jobless people in Beijing; (2) the relationship between the central and local authorities.

(I)
Employment of Unemployed and Jobless People

Before liberation, Beijing was a consumer city and a city with a large number of unemployed and jobless people. After liberation, we adopted various measures. By the end of 1955, the labor bureau had found employment for 60,000 people among the unemployed and those seeking employment; 54,000 people found employment on their own; and about 20,000 people were re-employed after undergoing various employment training programs. This does not include workers from other places. People with labor capacity, especially young people with education and skills who have no political problems, have been employed. From this perspective, the work has been successful.

However, there are still many people who have not been employed. Some of them have education and ability, but do not meet the employment requirements because they are too old, physically weak, or have disabilities. Some are young and strong, but lack skills and education and are unwilling to do manual labor, so they remain unemployed. There are also some housewives who are burdened with household chores and have employment requirements but cannot leave their families. And there are a few people who left their jobs because they were not satisfied with their interests, treatment, or location.

In addition, some people have not clarified general political and historical issues; some have social connections with counter-revolutionaries, even if they are only slightly involved; some are counter-revolutionaries who have been dealt with; and some, although they themselves have not engaged in reactionary activities, are family members of counter-revolutionaries. These people have a bad reputation. Although many of them have employment conditions, agencies, schools, and factories are unwilling to hire them, and we have not taken effective measures to enable them to find employment. They have difficulty finding jobs, face financial difficulties, and demand resettlement. It should be pointed out that it is entirely appropriate and necessary for the broad masses of people and cadres of agencies, schools, and factories and mines to hate, despise, and be vigilant against counter-revolutionaries who have harmed the country and the people. According to the country's policies, the first three categories of people should be properly assigned work according to the specific circumstances, as long as they clarify their problems and sever ties with counter-revolutionaries. As for the family members of counter-revolutionaries, they should have the same rights to employment, joining cooperatives, and attending school as ordinary citizens, as long as they have not participated in counter-revolutionary activities and should not be subject to any discrimination. In general, these people should be given the opportunity to work or study and transformed through work and study. We have recently begun to address this issue, repeatedly explaining the policy to employers and clarifying to cadres that if counter-revolutionaries who are unrepentant or engage in destructive activities are found after they are hired, the municipal party committee and municipal government will be responsible for the improper employment, and the cadres of the employing agencies will not be held responsible. In this way, they have been employed in large numbers. Of course, after these people are employed, it is impossible for no problems to occur. There may still be a very small number of people who engage in destructive activities, but we cannot stop eating for fear of choking and fail to solve this problem for fear of a few problems.

In recent months, due to the rapid progress of socialist transformation and the urgent need for labor in rural areas, the phenomenon of farmers blindly flowing into Beijing from other places has no longer occurred. On the other hand, due to the needs of various construction projects, various departments and factory and mining enterprises have greatly increased their staff. In this way, we have the possibility to further solve the employment problem of the unemployed and jobless people in the city. In February and March of this year, we registered young people seeking jobs and assigned more than 15,000 people to work or study in various factories, mines, and worker technical schools. In April, we organized the forces of labor, public security, civil affairs, and other departments to conduct a comprehensive survey and registration of the unemployed and jobless people in the city. By mid-May, a total of 33,367 people had been registered. Excluding 3,810 people who were not eligible for employment due to old age, young age, or serious illness or disability, there were actually 29,557 people. Among them, a total of 21,298 people have been introduced to various departments for application and trial employment, and the rest are still being resettled. The masses have responded extremely well to this measure, generally believing that the government should do this.

In order to better meet the needs of the country for personnel and the employment of unemployed and jobless people, much specific work must be done in the future. For example, the irrational use of labor in many departments at present should be gradually changed. People with the skills and expertise urgently needed by society should be selected for training and cultivation. Women seeking employment should be introduced to appropriate occupations or participate in certain professional studies as much as possible to create conditions for employment. In addition, we must overcome the shortcomings in our work and ideological obstacles in all aspects, and persuade employers to realistically consider the actual needs of their own units and the sources of labor, that is, to consider the situation of job seekers in an all-round way. The bias of preferring to use young people and rejecting older people, preferring to use men and rejecting women, preferring to use educated people and rejecting those who are uneducated or have low education, must be corrected. At the same time, the employment conditions should not be too high. Work that can be done by women should not be done by men. As long as the job seeker is competent, he or she should be hired, and it is not necessary to insist on young people or intellectuals. The competent departments should allocate manpower reasonably, accurately, and in a timely manner, so as to make people suitable for their positions, give full play to their strengths, give full play to their enthusiasm, and serve the country's production and construction.

(II) The Relationship Between the Central and Local Authorities

Regarding the relationship between the central and local authorities, the old saying was "It's difficult to be the magistrate of the capital." Our experience is that "Beijing is easy to govern." Beijing has many advantages over other places, and things are resolved quickly. Some things are resolved with a phone call or a few words in person. It is easy to handle affairs under the direct leadership of the central government. On the other hand, we also deeply feel that some departments of the central government sometimes issue directives directly to the responsible bureaus in a vertical manner, forgetting that there is a local government, and not giving us the opportunity to participate and make suggestions. Some things are managed too meticulously and rigidly, resulting in some confusion. Below, I will only present some examples of the relationship between the central and local authorities in past cultural, educational, and health work:

In the past few years, the biggest shortcoming of Beijing's education work was its low quality. In June 1954, we conducted an investigation and study and put forward a number of measures to improve the quality of primary and secondary education, implement the central government's policy of all-round development of education, and require students to be "three-good." We asked the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Education to review and revise it in advance (the Ministry of Education's journal "People's Education," in addition to publishing the decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on improving the quality of primary and secondary education in Beijing, also published an editorial calling on all provinces and cities across the country to learn and adopt this measure). At the municipal people's congress, repeated discussions and studies were conducted, resolutions were made, and the central government was requested to approve it, instructing the education department to implement it conscientiously. During the two summer vacations, hundreds of excellent teachers from various subjects were organized to compile and revise teaching reference materials of 6.4 million words, which effectively helped teachers grasp the central link of teaching and improve the level of teaching, which was welcomed by the majority of teachers. The political and ideological education of students was strengthened and the students' physical health was improved. The students' academic performance has improved. Judging from the results of the two unified examinations in Chinese and mathematics in Beijing in 1954, the number of students passing the first Chinese examination in the second grade of junior high school accounted for 82.5%, and the second time it was 94.8%. The number of students passing the first mathematics examination was 58.3%, and the second time it was 85.1%. The number of students passing the first arithmetic examination in the fifth grade of elementary school accounted for 80.26%, and the second time it was 88.1%. Furthermore, judging from the number of high school graduates who passed the entrance examinations for higher education institutions over the years: in 1953, it only accounted for 28% of the number of applicants, in 1954 it accounted for 15%, and in the year after the implementation of the resolution, in 1955, it rose to 67.4%. In 1954, the total average score of all students who participated in the examination was only 47.1, while in 1955 it was 65.2. The basic knowledge of students in other grades has also been improved. These specific facts show that the quality of primary and secondary education in Beijing has indeed improved this year. (Of course, we still have many shortcomings in the leadership of education work. In order to avoid wasting the representatives' time, I will not say much here.) Although there are still shortcomings in the work, the quality of education has indeed been improved. However, the Ministry of Education believed that doing so was ignoring the central government's policy of all-round development of education, and directly summoned many principals of municipal middle schools to the ministry for a meeting and criticized them. It was also said that our hope to improve within a year and a half was an impatient mood and not a steady advance. As a result, ideological confusion was created among some middle and primary school leaders in the city, and it was unclear whether the Ministry of Education's opinion was correct or whether the resolution of the municipal people's congress should be implemented. We also felt confused. From the perspective of educational theory, if it is said that we have ignored the policy of all-round development of education, then how can we be considered to be in compliance? What specific contents does the all-round development mentioned by the ministry include in addition to the "three-good," and we still do not understand it. Since the ministry opposes these measures, it should give us positive instructions on the correct approach, but it did not do so. From the perspective of leadership relations: these measures were approved by the municipal people's congress and approved by the central government with the consent of the Ministry of Education. If the Ministry of Education has different opinions, it should report to the central government and also tell us, but the Ministry of Education did not do so either. This problem has not been concluded until now, and it cannot but affect the work. Our cadres have opinions, believing that Beijing's work is easy to do but also difficult to do. It is praised by the city and students' parents, but criticized by the ministry.

The Ministry of Education's instructions on relevant principles and policies also often bypass the State Council and the municipal people's committee and are directly issued to the bureau in a vertical manner. Some methods are not completely consistent with the specific conditions of the city, causing difficulties in the work. For example, the Ministry of Education directly issued a "Work Plan for General Education and Normal Education in 1956" to the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus. Among them, many requirements, such as the implementation of the elementary school district system, etc., because our school settings are not balanced, the level of each school is not consistent, and there are still several private elementary schools, etc., can only call on residents' children to attend school nearby, and cannot rigidly implement the school district system. For example, the Ministry of Education requires all localities to implement production technology education in middle schools this year and add internship factories and experimental fields. However, there is no teaching syllabus, no specific teaching materials, no preparation for teachers and equipment, and no necessary setting up funds. As a result, some schools have recently rushed to solicit donations of machinery from industrial departments and students' parents, causing a lot of dissatisfaction and causing us a lot of difficulties.

Another example is the issue of elementary schools for children of cadres. The central government has instructed to change this system and gradually hand over some elementary schools for children of cadres to the local government for handling. Five schools have been handed over, but the competent department only gives the funding for the current year, and the next year it will be paid according to the general elementary school funding. Although a little subsidy is given, it is far from enough for the actual needs. Secondly, in name, the school has been handed over, but the enrollment task is still controlled by the personnel bureau of the State Council and other personnel departments. Although a few schools also recruited some day students last year, the number was very small. In this way, in name, it is handed over to the local government, but in reality, it is still the central government's elementary school for children of cadres, and it is only necessary for the city to be responsible for raising funds from the local government. We believe that elementary schools for children of cadres played a certain positive role before liberation, and the living conditions of cadres under the supply system at that time made it necessary to run such schools. But today, although there are advantages, such as better teachers, so students' academic performance is better. On the other hand, students' lives are relatively better, which easily fosters unhealthy feelings of superiority. Students' social knowledge is poor, schools and families are not easy to connect, and the link of family education is lacking. These shortcomings are serious and should be changed in a timely manner.

In terms of health, the work we have decided to do does not violate the central government's principles and policies, and the Ministry of Health also comes out to interfere. At the same time, the Ministry of Health directly assigns work to the health bureau without telling us, which makes us very embarrassed (because in addition to the bureaus under our jurisdiction, we also have deputy mayors in charge of various tasks). For example, Beijing's implementation of the problem of graded medical care. In recent years, more and more people have gone to the hospital for medical treatment, and all kinds of diseases, large and small, have been squeezed into large hospitals with better equipment and technology, making large hospitals very busy, doctors and nurses exhausted, and many doctors have to work all day and then be on duty at night, and even have to perform several operations. A nurse in the Second Hospital has to give injections to two hundred patients a day, and the nurses in the Children's Hospital have swollen arms from shaking thermometers. The number of outpatients in many hospitals far exceeds the quota, especially in Tongren Hospital and the Third Hospital, and there are still cases where people cannot get a number and see a doctor on the same day. Although medical staff are working so hard, and we have built and expanded some hospitals, it is far from being able to meet the needs of the people. We believe that if general minor illnesses are treated in grassroots medical institutions, there is no need to go to large hospitals. Diseases that cannot be treated at the grassroots level are referred to intermediate hospitals, and diseases that cannot be treated at intermediate hospitals are referred to central hospitals. Patients with acute diseases and life-threatening patients can of course go directly to large hospitals. Establish a division of labor and contact between medical institutions at all levels, and use publicity and education methods to enable the masses to basically implement the method of seeking medical treatment nearby and graded medical treatment in accordance with urban administrative divisions on the principle of conscious voluntariness, in order to reduce the busyness of large hospitals and improve the quality of medical treatment for serious and difficult diseases, instead of using zoning to force patients to only see a doctor in designated medical institutions. We call this method "graded medical care." In February 1955, after discussion at the municipal people's congress, it was decided to try it out, and the pilot work was first carried out in the Xisi District. When we were starting to do typical experiments, a deputy director of the Ministry of Health directly went to the health bureau and the pilot area to express his opposition to our method to the cadres, asking the health bureau to implement zoned medical services. Then, the Ministry of Health formally assigned the health bureau to conduct pilot work on "zoned medical services." This method is to delineate zones and restrict patients to only see a doctor in designated medical institutions. We went to the masses to understand the actual situation, and it is impossible to do it under the current conditions in Beijing. This is a more important matter that concerns the health of the broad masses of people and changes people's habits, and it is inappropriate not to notify the municipal people's committee in advance.

There are also problems with the management of ancient buildings. Beijing has many ancient buildings. Ancient cultural relics should be correctly measured from their historical and artistic value, and properly handled separately. It must not be thought that everything ancient is good, regardless of whether it has cultural relic value or whether it hinders construction, and should be preserved and repaired without analysis. It is not allowed to move anything. It is extreme to the point where even an irrelevant small land temple cannot be demolished. Old temples used as school classrooms, even if the light is not good and hinders students' eyesight, cannot be changed from the original building. If we handle things according to this view, Beijing can only remain as it is and be used as a museum. We can't do anything, we can only be the curators of this museum. On the other hand, there are no specific arrangements, no maintenance plans, and no budget for some ancient buildings that must be preserved and maintained. The past repair and protection work of these countless ancient buildings was all the responsibility of the Beijing Cultural Relics Restoration Committee under the Ministry of Culture. And some ancient buildings, such as the Forbidden City, are directly managed by the Ministry of Culture. But sometimes we are asked to do specific work without giving us funding. For example, in 1955, the Ministry of Culture only gave us 50,000 yuan for the repair of ancient buildings, and this year we don't even have this money, but we are asked to repair this and renovate that. For example, in 1954, the Ministry of Culture asked us to designate relevant agencies to be responsible for the repair and protection of ancient buildings in the city. We proposed to the Ministry of Culture that we have no organization, staffing, technical personnel, and funding, so it is not easy to take over, but there was no result. Sometimes, we take care of it, but the ministry comes out to interfere. For example, the plan to repair the Guozijian, which was approved by the State Council, was copied to the Ministry of Culture before the repair. However, the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture interfered during the repair, and even a cadre of the Cultural Relics Bureau went to the site to stop the project. Our opinion is that if the Ministry of Culture determines that we are responsible for the repair and protection of ancient buildings in Beijing, then it must hand over the original competent institutions, personnel, and funding together; and do not interfere with specific work casually.

Another example is the issue of state-owned theater troupes. A few years ago, the Ministry of Culture asked the municipal culture department to change several private theater troupes into state-owned ones. After repeated research, we believe that there are still difficulties. Because at that time, if state-owned were implemented, some famous actors would receive much less than their previous income according to our salary schedule, and some people with little artistic accomplishment who originally had very little remuneration would have to be raised. On the other hand, a part of the people with low political consciousness will have the idea of ​​the supply system, "Do it or not, two and a half catties," and they cannot give full play to their enthusiasm, which affects the improvement of artistic quality. Therefore, we temporarily adopted the method of private operation and public assistance. In 1955, the Ministry of Culture decided to order the Beijing Municipal Culture Department to change the Quyi Troupe and the Pingju Troupe to state-owned ones, and vertically assigned them to the Culture Department, each with 100 staff members and 30,000 yuan in funding. We learned about it afterwards and believed that the conditions were not ripe, and still requested to temporarily implement the method of private operation and public assistance. Later, the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Culture affirmed at the meeting that the folk professional troupes operating in cooperation are the direction of future development, criticized the impatience of changing to state-owned ones too early, and finally issued instructions. However, when the ministry allocated funds, it denied the direction it had affirmed; other regions that ran state-owned theater troupes were given more money, while Beijing that ran private operation and public assistance was given less money. It is stipulated that state-owned theater troupes will be given 35,000 yuan, while private operation and public assistance will only be given 3,000 yuan, and the money for public assistance is decreasing year by year. Last year, we were given 71,000 yuan for private operation and public assistance, but this year we only have 18,000 yuan. This is tantamount to showing that, in fact, what the ministry is implementing is not the policy of private operation and public assistance that they have stipulated, but still encourages the policy of establishing state-owned theater troupes early. This year, in the high tide of socialist transformation, the Art Bureau of the Ministry of Culture convened a symposium of directors of cultural departments and bureaus of four provinces and cities, asking all localities to change private theater troupes into state-owned ones as soon as possible, and also said that it is easier to solve this problem in the high tide of socialist transformation. We believe that such repeated changes, regardless of the specific conditions of various places and the actual conditions of the theater troupes, and requiring them to be handled uniformly, and not considering a transition period, neither conforms to the spirit of the original instructions nor is in line with reality.

From these examples, it can be seen that the Ministry of Culture not only manages too meticulously and rigidly, but also manages in a chaotic manner. Of course, the decentralism, lack of organization, and lack of discipline of the Municipal Culture Department (now changed to the Bureau) are also serious, and we are also responsible.

The above examples show the necessity of giving local authorities the necessary hierarchical responsibility and adapting to local conditions under the unified leadership and unified planning of the central government; it also shows the necessity of appropriately expanding the local authorities' authority and flexibility in financial management, so that the local authorities can arrange their own income and expenditure according to local conditions within the controlled figures of the total budget. By doing so, our country's construction work will be done faster, more, better, and more economically.

专栏：

    关于北京市工作中的两个问题
    ——吴晗代表的发
    我完全同意李先念副总理兼财政部长关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，农业部廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的报告，彭真副委员长关于常务委员会的工作报告。我现在就以下两个问题：（1）北京市的无业失业的人就业问题；（2）中央和地方的关系问题，发表一些意见。
                          （一）
    无业失业的人就业问题
    北京在解放以前，是个消费城市，也是无业失业的人较多的城市。解放后，我们采取了各种措施，到1955年底，在失业和要求就业的人中，经劳动局介绍就业的已有6万人；自己就业的54，000人，经过各种就业训练再安置就业的约两万多人，外来的工人还不算。住在城市中的有劳动力的特别是年轻的、有文化的、有技术的没有政治问题的人都已就业了，从这方面说，工作是有成绩的。
    但是，现在，仍然还有不少人没有就业：其中一部分人有文化、有能力，因年纪过大或者体弱多病或有残疾等等，没有就业条件；一部分人年富力强，但是没有技术，缺乏文化，而又不愿作体力劳动工作，就不了业；还有一部分家庭主妇，家务繁重，有就业要求，只是离不开家庭；还有少数人安排了工作，又因为兴趣、待遇、地点不合而离开了。
    另外，一部分人因为有一般性的政治历史问题，没有讲清楚；有一部分人同反革命分子有社会关系，甚至多少沾些边；一部分人是处理过的反革命分子；一部分人本身虽没有反动行为，但是反革命分子的家属，这些人名誉不好，虽然其中有不少人有就业条件，机关、学校和工厂都不愿意要，而我们过去又没有认真采取有效措施，使他们就业。他们找职业很不容易，生活困难，要求安置。应该指出：广大人民群众和机关、学校、厂矿干部对于那些曾经危害过国家和人民的反革命分子的仇视、敌视、提高警惕，是完全应当的和必要的。根据国家的政策，前三类人只要他们把问题讲清楚了；同反革命分子切断关系了，应该根据具体情况，适当安置工作。至于反革命分子的家属，只要他们没有参加反革命活动，本来就应该和一般公民有同等就业、入社和上学权利，不应该受到任何歧视。总的来说，应该给这些人以就业或者学习的机会，在工作和学习中改造他们。我们最近着手解决这个问题，向用人单位反复说明政策，并且向干部说清楚，录用这些人以后，如果发现其中有怙恶不悛的反革命分子或者有破坏行为，由市委、市政府负用人不当的责任，不要用人机关的干部负责，这样，他们才大批大批地就了业。当然这些人就业以后，不可能一个乱子也不会出，还可能有极少数人进行破坏活动，但不能因噎废食，怕出个把乱子而不解决这个问题。
    近几个月来，由于社会主义改造事业的迅速进展，农村对劳动力迫切需要，过去外地农民盲目流入北京的现象，已不再发生了。另一方面，由于各种建设事业的需要，各部门和厂矿企业都大量增加人员。这样，我们就有可能来进一步解决本市无业失业的人的就业问题。今年二、三月间，我们对要求职业的青年进行了登记，分配了15，000余人到各厂矿和工人技术学校工作或学习；4月间组织了劳动、公安、民政等部门力量，对本市无业失业的人进行了全面的调查登记，到5月中旬，共登记了33，367人。除去3，810人由于年老、年幼或有严重疾病、残疾不合就业条件以外，实有29，557人。其中已经介绍到各部门投考、试用的共21，298人，其余的人仍在安置中。群众对这一措施反映极好，普遍认为政府应该这样办。
    为了更好地解决国家用人的需要，无业失业的人的就业，今后还必须做许多具体工作。如目前许多部门使用劳动力不合理现象，应逐步加以改变；对社会上迫切需要的技术、业务人员应该选择对象加以训练培养；对要求就业的妇女，应当尽可能介绍适当职业或者参加某些专业学习，为就业创造条件。此外，还必须克服我们工作中的缺点和各方面的思想障碍，说服用人单位实事求是地根据自己单位的实际需要和劳动力来源，即要求从就业者的情况全面考虑，对于那种喜欢用年轻的，拒绝用年纪大的；喜欢用男的，拒绝用女的；喜欢用有文化的，拒绝没有文化或文化低的等等偏向，必须改正。同时用人条件不要过高，能用妇女的工作就不要用男的，只要就业者力能胜任，就应该录用，也不要非要青年，非要知识分子不可。主管部门调配人力要作到合理、准确、及时，做到人事相宜，能发挥所长，发挥积极性，为国家生产建设服务。（二）中央和地方的关系问题
    关于中央和地方的关系，旧时代的话“京兆尹难做”，我们的体验是“北京市好做”，北京许多方面比别的地方占便宜，事情解决快，有些事情一个电话或者见面几句话就解决了。在中央直接领导下好办事。另一方面也深感中央有些部门对市里的工作有时对主管局条条下达，垂直布置，忘记了还有一个地方政府，没有给我们以与闻和提出意见的机会，有些事情管得过细、过死，以致有些乱。以下我仅就过去的文教卫生工作中的中央和地方的关系提出一些例子：
    前几年，北京市教育工作的最大缺点是质量不高。1954年6月我们作了调查研究，提出了提高中、小学教育质量的若干措施，贯彻中央全面发展的教育方针，要求学生做到三好。事先请教育部负责同志审阅修改过（教育部的机关刊物“人民教育”除刊载中共北京市委关于提高北京市中小学教育质量的决定外，还发表了社论，号召全国各省市学习并采用这一措施），在市各界人民代表会议上，反复讨论、研究、作出决议，又报请中央批准，责成教育部门认真执行。在两个暑假期间，组织了几百个各科优秀教师，先后编写和修改了各科教学参考资料640万字，有效地帮助教师掌握教学中心环节，提高教学水平，受到广大教师的欢迎；加强了学生的政治思想教育和改善了学生的身体健康状况；学生的学业成绩有了进步。从北京市1954年两次统一考试语文、数学的成绩来看，初中二年级第一次语文及格人数占82.5％，第二次为94.8％，第一次数学及格人数占58.3％，第二次为85.1％。小学五年级算术第一次及格人数占80.26％，第二次占88.1％。再从高中毕业生历年投考高等学校及格人数来看：1953年只占投考人数的28％，1954年占15％，而在执行决议后的一年，1955年则上升为67.4％。1954年参加考试的全体学生总平均分数只47.1，1955年则为65.2。其他年级学生的基础知识也有所提高。这些具体事实都说明了这一年北京市的中、小学教育质量已有进步。（当然我们在教育工作领导方面缺点还很多，为了避免浪费代表们的时间，我在这里就不多说了。）虽然工作上还有缺点，但教育质量是确实有所提高的。但是教育部却以为这样做是忽视中央全面发展的教育方针，直接召集市属中学许多校长到部开会，批评了一顿。又说我们希望一年半载内提高，是一种急躁情绪，不是稳步前进。这样一来，造成市的一部分中、小学领导干部思想上的混乱，弄不清是教育部的意见对呢？还是应该执行市人民代表会议的决议？我们也感到困惑，从教育理论说，说我们忽视全面发展的教育方针，那么怎样做才算符合呢？究竟部里所讲的全面发展除三好以外，还包括一些什么具体内容，我们迄今还弄不清楚。部里既然反对这些措施，就应该正面指示我们以正确的做法，但是，并没有这样做；从领导关系说：经过教育部同意，市人民代表会议通过，中央批准的这些措施，教育部有不同意见应该报告中央，也应该告诉我们，但是教育部也没有这样做。这个问题到现在还没有结论，不能不影响到工作，我们的干部是有意见的，认为北京的工作好做而又不好做，受市里和学生家长的表扬，却挨部里的批评。
    教育部对有关方针政策的指示，也往往不通过国务院和市人民委员会，直接条条下达到局。有些办法和市的具体情况不完全一致，给工作造成困难。例如教育部直接发给省市教育厅、局一个“关于1956年普通教育和师范教育的工作计划”，其中，不少的要求，像实行小学学区制等，因为我们的学校设置还不平衡，各个学校的水平也不一致，还有若干私立小学等等，因此，只能号召居民子弟就近上学，还不能硬性地实行学区制。又如教育部要求各地于今年在中学实施生产技术教育，增设实习工厂和实验园地。但既无教学大纲，又无具体教材，师资、设备都缺乏准备，也无必要的设置经费。以致最近有些学校纷纷乱向工业部门以及学生家长募捐机器，引起很多不满，也给我们造成了很多困难。
    又如干部子弟小学问题。中央曾指示要改变这个制度，把一些干部子弟小学逐步交给地方办理。学校已交下五个，但是主管部只给当年的经费，下一年就照一般小学经费开支，虽给一点补助，远不够实际需要；其次，名义上学校是交下了，招生任务仍由国务院人事局和其他人事部门掌握，去年有几个学校虽然也招了一些走读生，但数量很少。这样，名义上交给地方，实际上仍是中央的干部子弟小学，而只是要市负责从地方筹措经费。我们认为干部子弟小学在解放以前曾起了一定的积极作用，并且那时候的干部供给制生活的情况也非办这样的学校不可。但在今天来说，虽然有好处，如因师资较好，所以学生的学业成绩好一些；但在另一方面，学生生活比较好，容易养成不健康的优越感；学生的社会知识贫乏，学校和家庭不容易联系，缺乏家庭教育这一环节。这些缺点都是严重的，应该及时改变。
    卫生方面，我们决定要做的工作，并不违背中央的方针政策，卫生部也出来干预；同时卫生部直接向卫生局布置工作，又不告诉我们，使我们很为难（因为我们除了主管的局以外，还有专管各项工作的副市长）。例如，北京市实行分级分工医疗问题。几年来，上医院看病的人越来越多，大小病都挤到大的即设备、技术较高的医院去看，弄得大医院非常忙乱，医生护士劳累不堪，不少医生白天工作一天，夜里要连着值班，甚至还得做上几个手术。第二医院一个护士一天要给二百个病人
  打针，儿童医院护士甩体温表，胳膊都甩肿了。不少医院的门诊病人远远超过了定额，特别是同仁医院和第三医院，还有当天挂不上号，看不上病的现象。虽然医护
  人员这样紧张的工作，并且我们也新建和扩建了一些医院，但是还远不能适应人民的需要。我们认为：如一般小病在基层医疗机构就诊，就不必到大医院去，基层治不了的病，介绍到中级医院，中级医院治不了，介绍到中心医院，患急性病和有生命危险的病人，当然可以直接去大的医院。各级医疗机构之间建立分工联系，以宣传教育的方法，使人民群众在自觉自愿的原则下，基本上按照城市行政区划，实行就近就医和分级就诊的办法，以减少大医院的忙乱，提高对重病疑难病的医疗质量，而不是用划区划片强制的办法，限制病人只能在指定的医疗机构看病，我们把这种办法叫作“分级分工医疗”。1955年2月经市人民代表大会讨论做了决定试办，就先在西四区进行试点工作。我们正在开始作典型试验的时候，卫生部的一位副司长就直接到卫生局和试点区向干部表示反对我们的办法，要卫生局实行划区医疗服务，接着卫生部就正式布置卫生局进行“划区医疗服务”的试点工作，这个办法就是要划区划片，限制病人只能在指定的医疗机构看病。我们到群众中了解实际情况，在北京目前的条件下，是办不到的。这是一件和广大人民健康与改变人民习惯比较重大的事情，事先竟不通知市人民委员会，也是不妥当的。
    关于古建筑物的保管也有问题，北京市的古建筑物很多，对古代文物应该从它的历史和艺术价值方面作正确衡量，分别作恰当处置。绝不能认为凡是古代的东西都好，不管有无文物价值，对建设有无妨害，一律不加分析地要加以保存、修缮，一律不能动，极端到连一座不相干的小土地庙也不能拆；用作学校教室的旧庙宇，尽管光线不好，妨害学生视力，也不能对原建筑有所改变，照这种看法办事，北京只好原封不动，当作一个博物馆，我们什么事也不能做，只好做这个博物馆的馆员了。另一方面对于一些必须保存养护的古建筑物，却又没有具体安排，没有保修计划，也没有预算。这无数的古建筑物过去的修缮、保护工作都是由文化部所属北京文物整理委员会负责。并且有些古建筑如故宫，还直接由文化部保管。但有时又要我们做具体工作，而不给经费。例如1955年文化部只给我们古建筑修缮费5万元，今年连这点钱也没有了，但是却提出这个也要修，那个也要整。又如1954年文化部要我们将市里的古建筑物的修缮、保护工作，指定有关机关负责，我们向文化部提出没有机构、编制、技术人员和经费，不好接办，没有结果。有时候，我们管了，而部里又出来干涉。例如经国务院批准的修缮国子监计划，修缮前，国务院曾把批文抄送给文化部，但在修缮中文化部的文物局却出来干涉，甚至文物局的一个干部竟到现场阻止工程的进行。我们的意见，文化部如果确定北京市的古建筑修缮、保护工作要我们负责，那就必须把原来的主管机构和人员、经费一齐交下来；并且对具体工作，不要随便干涉。
    又如国营剧团问题。前几年，文化部要市文化处把几个民营剧团改为国营。我们反复研究，认为尚有困难。因为当时实行国营，有些名演员，按照我们的工资表，会比他们过去的收入要少得多，有些没有什么艺术修养原来报酬很少的人又势须提高；另一方面有一部分政治觉悟尚低的人就会产生供给制思想，“干不干，二斤半”，不能很好地发挥他们的积极性，影响艺术质量的提高。因此，我们暂时采取了民营公助的方式。1955年文化部又决定叫北京市文化处把曲艺团和评剧团改为国营，并垂直下达给文化处，各给编制100名，经费30，000元。我们事后知道，认为条件不成熟，仍然要求暂时实行民营公助方式。后来，文化部的负责同志在会议上肯定了合作经营的民间职业剧团是今后发展的方向，批判了过早改为国营的急躁情绪，最后还发布了指示。可是部里分配经费的时候，又否定了自己肯定的方向；别的地区搞国营剧团就多给钱，北京搞民营公助就少给钱。规定国营剧团给35，000元，民营公助只给3，000元，而且，公助的钱还逐年减少，去年民营公助款共给我们71，000元，今年却只有18，000元了。这无异于说明，事实上部里执行的并不是他们自己规定的民营公助的方针，还是鼓励早搞国营剧团的政策。今年，在社会主义改造高潮中，文化部艺术局召集四省市文化厅局长座谈，要各地及早将民营剧团改为国营，还说在社会主义改造高潮中解决这个问题比较好办。我们认为这样反复变更，不顾各地具体情况和剧团条件的实际，而要一律照办，也不考虑有个过渡时间，既不符合原指示的精神，也不切合实际。
    从这些例子看来，文化部对下面不但管得过细，过死，还管得乱。当然，市里的文化处（现在改为局）的分散主义、无组织无纪律的现象也是严重的，我们也是有责任的。
    上面这些例子说明了在中央统一领导、统一计划下，给地方以分级负责、因地制宜的必要；也说明了适当地扩大地方在财政管理上的权限和机动性，使地方在预算总额的控制数字以内，能够根据当地的情况安排自己收支的必要。这样做，我们国家的建设工作将会做得又快、又多、又好、又省。
