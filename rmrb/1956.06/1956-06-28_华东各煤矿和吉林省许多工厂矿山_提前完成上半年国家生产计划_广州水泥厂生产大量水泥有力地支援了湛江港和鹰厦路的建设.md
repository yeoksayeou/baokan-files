Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th. According to statistics released today by the Jinan Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry, coal mines in East China have already overfulfilled the state's coal production and tunneling plan for the first half of the year by seven days, on the 23rd. It is estimated that by the end of June, they will produce 400,000 tons more coal than in the first half of last year.

	In the first half of this year, the 21 production mines under this bureau have universally launched socialist emulation campaigns, and promoted advanced experiences such as one-shift coal mining, deepening cutting plates, winch coal recovery, and two-person piecework wages, based on the specific conditions of each mine. The Zibo Mining Bureau promoted 46 advanced experiences in its coal mines, increasing labor productivity by more than 18% compared to the same period last year.

	In the first half of the year, the mines also took some effective measures to ensure that the gangue content and ash content of coal were reduced to below the national standards.

This newspaper, Changchun, 27th. Many state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Jilin Province have pre-fulfilled the state's production plan for the first half of the year. By mid-June, state-owned enterprises in Jilin Province had completed an average of 102.63% of the production plan for the first half of the year; 6 out of 17 major products had completed the plan. For example, the double-wheeled double-share plow completed 103.67% of the plan, enameled washbasins completed 106.6% of the plan, and paper completed 134.76% of the plan. State-owned Fengman Power Plant and other factories and mines also pre-fulfilled the production plan for the first half of the year in mid-June.

	These units vigorously promoted and applied advanced experiences in completing the production plan. The Jilin Ceramics Factory promoted advanced experiences such as "not removing mud from roughcast" and "controlling flame kiln firing method." By June 15, it had overfulfilled the production value plan for the first half of the year by 11.25%. This factory made full use of local magnetic materials, the amount used accounting for 85% of the total raw materials. This not only ensured the supply of raw materials but also greatly reduced product costs. In the advanced producer movement, the Fengman Power Plant paid attention to safe production work, and equipment accidents were reduced by more than 80% compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. The state-owned Guangzhou Cement Plant fully completed the production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule on the 26th. The large quantities of cement produced by this factory this year have powerfully supported the basic construction projects of Zhanjiang Port, the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, and the Central and Southern China region; in addition, some cement products were exported to Southeast Asia.

	This year's production plan for this factory was formulated according to the level of 1957. The hourly output of all its rotary kilns has now exceeded the original design capacity by 57%.

	In the advanced producer movement, in addition to regularly summarizing, exchanging, and promoting the advanced experiences of the workers, the factory also strengthened the research and experimentation of new technologies, consolidating and promoting many advanced Soviet experiences. In particular, adding fluorite as a flux in the raw materials for cement production extends the effective length of the calcination zone of the rotary kiln, which not only saves fuel coal but also makes the clinker fired stronger than last year by half, which can make high-grade cement; the amount of mixed materials added to the mixed cement it produces has increased by 30% compared to last year, and the quality is even better than last year. Therefore, cement production has been increased and costs have been reduced.

    提前完成上半年国家生产计划

    新华社济南25日电　据煤炭工业部济南管理局今天统计，华东各煤矿已经在二十三日提前七天超额完成了国家上半年产煤和掘进计划。预计到六月底，能比去年上半年多产四十万吨煤。
    今年上半年，这个局所属的二十一个生产矿井，普遍开展了社会主义竞赛，根据各矿的具体情况推广了一班采煤、加深截盘、回柱绞车和双人计件工资等先进经验。淄博矿务局各煤矿推广了四十六项先进经验，劳动生产率比去年同期提高18％以上。
    上半年各矿井还采取了一些有效措施，使煤的含矸率和灰粉率，都降到国家规定的指标以下。
    本报长春27日电　吉林省许多国营和地方国营厂矿单位提前完成上半年国家生产计划。到六月中旬止，吉林省营企业平均已完成上半年生产计划102.63％；在十七种主要产品中有六种完成了计划。如双轮双铧犁完成计划103.67％，搪磁面盆完成计划106.6％，纸完成计划134.76％。国营丰满发电厂等厂矿，也在六月中旬提前完成了上半年生产计划。
    这些单位在完成生产计划中，大力推广和运用了先进经验。吉林省陶磁厂推广了“粗坯不扒泥”、“控制火焰烧窑法”等先进经验，到六月十五日超额完成上半年产值计划11.25％。这个工厂充分利用了当地的磁料，所用数量占原料总数量85％。这样不但保证了原料供应，而且使产品成本大大降低。丰满发电厂在先进生产者运动中，注意了安全生产工作，供电设备事故比去年同时期减少了80％以上。
    新华社广州27日电　国营广州水泥厂在二十六日提前全面完成了上半年的生产计划。这个厂今年生产的大量水泥，有力地支援了湛江港、鹰潭—厦门铁路和中南地区的基本建设工程；另外，还有一部分水泥产品外销到东南亚。
    这个厂今年的生产计划，是按照1957年的水平制定的。它所有的回转窑的台时产量，现在已经超过原来设计能力57％。
    在先进生产者运动中，这个厂除了经常总结、交流和推广职工群众的先进经验外，还加强了对新技术的研究、试验工作，巩固和推广了许多苏联的先进经验。特别是在制水泥的生料中掺入莹石作熔剂，使回转窑的煆烧带的有效长度延长了，不但节约燃煤而且烧成的熟料的强度比去年提高了一半，能制成高标号的水泥；它制成混合水泥所掺入的混合材比去年增加了30％，而质量比去年还要好。因此，增产了水泥又降低了成本。
