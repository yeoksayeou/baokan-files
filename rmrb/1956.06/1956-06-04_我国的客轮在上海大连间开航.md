    China's passenger ships have officially begun service between the seaports of Shanghai and Dalian, operating daily.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai reports: At 4:00 PM on the 1st, the comfortably equipped passenger ship "Zhongxing No. 9," carrying its first batch of passengers, set sail from the Huangpu River amidst celebratory music and firecrackers, heading for Dalian.

    Before the "Zhongxing No. 9" departed, an inaugural ceremony was held. Liu Yanmu, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Maritime Administration, stated at the ceremony: This is the first time in history that China has its own passenger ships sailing between Shanghai and Dalian.

    Among the 174 passengers on the first voyage, many were workers, technicians, teachers, and students. Some were going to the Northeast to support national construction, while others were going to Qingdao for rest and sightseeing.

    Xinhua News Agency, Dalian reports: At 6:00 PM on the 1st, all the ships docked in Dalian Port sounded their horns for a long time. The passenger ship "Democracy No. 9," making its first voyage from Dalian to Shanghai, slowly left the port amidst the celebratory horn blasts. Over 300 passengers were on board for its first voyage. Some of them had not been home for one or two decades because they felt that taking the train was too expensive. This time, some entire families, including several members, were taking the ship together to visit their long-separated hometowns. (Xinhua News Agency)

    我国的客轮在上海大连间开航
    上海、大连两海港，一日正式对开客轮。
    据新华社驻上海记者报道：一日下午四时，设备舒适的“中兴九号”客轮，载着第一批旅客在欢送的乐曲和鞭炮声中，从黄浦江边启碇开往大连。
    在“中兴九号”启碇之前，曾经举行了开航仪式。上海海运管理局副局长刘延穆在开航仪式上讲话说：上海到大连，这是历史上第一次有中国自己的客运轮船航行。
    首批搭乘这趟客轮的174名旅客中，有许多是工人、技术人员、教师和学生，他们有的去东北支援国家建设；有的到青岛去休养和游览。
    又据新华社驻大连记者报道：一日下午六点钟，停泊在大连港的所有的轮船上，汽笛长鸣不已，首次从大连开往上海的客轮“民主九号”，在欢送的汽笛声中徐徐驶出了港口。首次搭乘这趟客轮的，有三百多名旅客。他们当中的有些人，过去因为感到坐火车回家花钱比较多，曾经有一、二十年没有回过家；这次，有的全家好几口人一起乘船，回去看望久别的家乡。　（新华社）
