The Budget Committee of the First National People's Congress
    Review Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget
    (Passed by the Budget Committee of the First National People's Congress on June 28, 1956)
    Chairman of the Budget Committee of the National People's Congress: Liu Lantao
    The Budget Committee of the First National People's Congress listened to the "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget" by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, studied the opinions of the delegates to the Congress regarding the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, and reviewed the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget.
    In the process of reviewing the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, the Budget Committee consulted the government based on the opinions raised by the delegates to the Congress and conducted discussions. Now, on behalf of the Budget Committee, I will summarize the results of the review into several issues as follows:

    I. On the Issue of 1955 Final Account Revenue and
        1956 Budget Revenue
    In the 1955 National Final Accounts, neither industrial and commercial taxes nor commercial income completed the originally approved budget. In addition to agreeing with the analysis made by Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian in the "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget" regarding the reasons for the shortfall, the Budget Committee believes that the shortcomings in commercial work should also be pointed out. The failure to complete the 1955 income plan for state-owned commerce, in addition to being related to changes in market conditions and overly ambitious targets, was also significantly due to shortcomings in the work of the commercial sector itself. For example, the urban and rural commercial networks were not well organized, the supply of goods was not timely, often resulting in stockpiles here and shortages there; losses and waste in the storage and transportation of goods were still significant; and so on. The commercial sector should strive to overcome these shortcomings.
    The 1956 National Budget stipulates that after state-private joint ventures use their current year's income to offset their current year's expenditures, they must also complete the task of remitting 200 million yuan to the state. During the discussion, some delegates raised the question of whether it was appropriate for state-private joint ventures to bear the task of contributing to the state budget, considering that they themselves need to develop. Regarding this issue, the Budget Committee consulted the government and, after research, believes that it is possible for state-private joint ventures to bear the task of remitting 200 million yuan to the state budget after using their own income to offset investments.

    II. On the Issue of Practicing Thrift in Capital Construction
    Great achievements were made in practicing thrift and opposing waste in capital construction in 1955. As a result of practicing thrift in capital construction, the state saved more than 1 billion yuan, and in 1955, more than 60 projects above the quota were added using the saved funds. Another significant achievement of practicing thrift in 1955 was overcoming the then rather prevalent unhealthy trends of extravagance and a focus on ostentation. However, it should be pointed out that some deviations also occurred in the implementation of thrift measures. The main issue was the lack of overall planning when reducing capital construction investment, which resulted in the suspension of some projects midway, causing waste of manpower and materials; excessive reductions in certain non-productive construction investments, with insufficient attention paid to employee housing and auxiliary buildings serving industrial bases; and certain unreasonable aspects in reducing construction costs, resulting in some buildings with excessively low standards, impracticality, and poor engineering quality. For example, the construction costs of some hospitals were reduced too low to meet the needs of the hospitals. Furthermore, the roof of the newly built factory building of the Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing was too thin to prevent cold, and it had already leaked water last winter; the newly built employee dormitories of this factory last year also had cracks in the walls and leaks in the roof due to excessively low construction costs and defects in construction. The delegates to the Congress raised many criticisms regarding these shortcomings, and the Budget Committee believes that these criticisms are correct.
    The Budget Committee believes that thrift is an important method of socialist capital accumulation, and it must continue to be implemented in capital construction in the future. However, in the process of implementing thrift, attention should also be paid to preventing possible one-sided pursuit of thrift, neglecting engineering quality, and other deviations, otherwise, it will also bring harm to the country's construction cause. Therefore, the principle of "applicable, economical, and aesthetically pleasing where possible" must be conscientiously implemented in capital construction. Employee housing and other auxiliary buildings should be actively and systematically resolved; any construction standards that have been unreasonably lowered should be revised. In addition to this, some delegates also raised the issue of urban construction planning and municipal construction in coastal cities. The Budget Committee believes that urban construction should have a unified plan in the future, and rational arrangements must be made for offices, schools, factories, and public buildings in the city. If the layout is improper, it will cause losses in the future. Many coastal cities are China's original industrial bases and should be fully utilized. Appropriate consideration should also be given to investment in municipal construction in these cities.

    III. On the Issue of Social, Cultural, and Educational Expenses
    Regarding social, cultural, and educational expenses, the main issues raised by the delegates to the Congress are: first, the large surplus of social, cultural, and educational expenses in 1955; and second, issues related to health expenditures.
    The Budget Committee reviewed the surplus of social, cultural, and educational expenses in 1955. The main reasons for the large surplus of social, cultural, and educational expenses are as follows: (1) In 1955, projects were reduced in capital construction, and construction costs were lowered, and the capital construction tasks were not completed as planned. Also, some equipment ordered from abroad did not arrive on time, resulting in a total surplus of more than 282 million yuan; (2) Enrollment plans were reduced, resulting in a surplus of more than 103 million yuan; (3) Agricultural harvests were abundant, and infectious diseases were reduced, resulting in reduced expenditures on relief and epidemic prevention, with a total surplus of more than 95 million yuan. In addition, the cultural, educational, and health departments practiced thrift in the implementation of the 1955 budget, which also saved some funds. The Budget Committee believes that the large surplus of cultural, educational, and health expenses in 1955 was mainly due to the failure to complete capital construction as planned. Although this is related to the lack of comprehensive planning in capital construction during the implementation of thrift last year, it is also due to reasons such as "designing in the same year, construction in the same year, and queuing up last" in the capital construction of the cultural, educational, and health departments over the years. This is also a problem that must be solved. In order to change this situation, the capital construction of the cultural, educational, and health departments should be better arranged by the departments responsible for design and construction, and the materials supply departments. Secondly, reducing enrollment plans is also a major cause of the large surplus of funds, and some of these reductions are not appropriate.
    The Budget Committee also studied the issue of health expenditures. There were indeed many shortcomings in the management of health expenditures in 1955. On the one hand, there was a large surplus of health expenditures, with 18 million yuan in hospital bed subsidies alone not spent; on the other hand, the charging standards of medical institutions were too high. The reason for this situation is mainly that the financial management system places too strict restrictions on institutions, lacks flexibility in implementation, hospital charging standards lack control, and there are incorrect profit-seeking viewpoints. The Budget Committee believes that the management system for health expenditures must be improved in the future; hospital charging standards should be appropriately lowered and strictly controlled; and hospital management should be further improved to overcome various wasteful phenomena. After the charging standards are lowered and the income of the hospitals themselves is reduced, the state budget should increase some subsidies.

    IV. On the Issue of Farmers' Burdens and Rural Primary School
        Expenses
    The 1956 National Budget stipulates that the local self-raised income attached to the agricultural tax will be increased from no more than 12% of the agricultural tax to no more than 22%. The increased income will be used to solve part of the rural primary school expenses. During the discussion, some delegates raised the question of whether the increased local self-raised income would place an excessive burden on farmers. According to the materials provided by the government, the Budget Committee believes that the current burden on farmers is not heavy. From 1953 to 1955, the state implemented a policy of stabilizing the burden on farmers, stabilizing the amount of agricultural tax at the 1952 level. This policy has had a good effect on promoting increased production and improving the lives of farmers. In 1956, the proportion of local self-raised income to agricultural tax was increased from no more than 12% to no more than 22%. On the basis of the development of agricultural production, the burden on farmers still does not exceed the 1952 burden level. The percentage of agricultural tax and local self-raised income in agricultural output was 13.2% in 1952, 12.12% in 1953, 12.94% in 1954, 11.54% in 1955, and is expected to be 11.4% in 1956. This shows that it is feasible to increase a part of local self-raised income this year. However, the local self-raised income used to solve rural primary school expenses should be allocated and used uniformly by the Provincial and Municipal People's Committees in accordance with the regulations of the State Council and should not be handed over to agricultural production cooperatives for self-raising. Agricultural production cooperatives that are willing and have the strength to run their own schools can be an exception. As for whether rural primary school education funds should be included in the local budget in the future, it can be left to the State Council to consider uniformly when studying and resolving the management system of undertakings and the financial management system.

    V. On Issues Related to the Financial Management System
    Regarding the issue of the financial management system, the Budget Committee agrees with the shortcomings pointed out by Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian in the "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget." The Budget Committee believes that the national financial management system should not only ensure the unified planning and unified leadership of national finance but also give full play to the initiative of all levels and departments. With the development of national construction and changes in the situation, the financial management system should also be modified accordingly to better reflect this principle. At present, the main problems in the financial management system are that the scope of authority of the central finance and local finance is not clear enough, the financial management authority of the finance department and various enterprises and institutions is not clear enough, the central finance manages local finance too meticulously and strictly, and there are some missing flexible regulations in the system. Therefore, in the process of implementing the national budget, on the one hand, some projects have money to spend, but cannot spend it, and on the other hand, some problems that should be solved have not been solved, resulting in some unreasonable phenomena in the allocation and use of funds. The existence of this situation has affected the development of some undertakings to a certain extent and has also affected the initiative of all levels and departments to a certain extent. The Budget Committee believes that these issues should be properly resolved when studying the financial system.
    The above are the review opinions of the Budget Committee on several issues in the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget. The Budget Committee believes that many of the problems raised by the delegates to the Congress regarding the national budget should be resolved. Of course, when resolving these problems, it is also necessary to take into account the country's financial resources, prioritize the issues under the principle of ensuring key construction, and gradually seek solutions, rather than demanding, nor is it possible to solve all of them at once.
    The Budget Committee believes that the total revenue of the 1955 National Final Accounts is 30,357,976,000 yuan, the total expenditure is 29,346,938,000 yuan, and the year-end surplus is 1,011,038,000 yuan, which is generally appropriate. The situation of the 1955 National Final Accounts is basically good, and it is recommended that the National People's Congress approve this final account. The total revenue of the 1956 National Budget is 30,742,770,000 yuan, of which the current year's revenue is 29,731,732,000 yuan, and the revenue carried over from the previous year is 1,011,038,000 yuan; the total expenditure is 30,742,770,000 yuan, and the revenue and expenditure are balanced. The Budget Committee believes that such an arrangement for the total revenue and total expenditure of the 1956 National Budget is appropriate. Given that the national budget involves all aspects of national economic activity, the situation is complex, and some changes are difficult to predict in advance, in order to better implement the 1956 National Budget, the Budget Committee believes that if the situation changes during the implementation of the national budget, the State Council can make some necessary adjustments in accordance with the budget guidelines approved by the National People's Congress, and report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress within a certain period.
    The arrangement of revenue and expenditure in the 1956 National Budget is positive and relatively reliable. The successful completion of the 1956 National Budget will accelerate the pace of socialist construction in our country. The characteristic of the 1956 National Budget is that both revenue and expenditure are growing rapidly. In terms of revenue, the revenue from state-owned enterprises, including the profits and taxes paid by enterprises, accounts for 74.34% of the current year's revenue; in terms of expenditure, the amount of investment in capital construction will reach 14 billion yuan, exceeding the investment amount of any previous year. This shows that to complete the 1956 National Budget, a tremendous effort must be made. Continuing to adhere to the efforts of increasing production and practicing economy is the basic guarantee for realizing the 1956 National Budget. For this purpose, the industrial sector must further strengthen leadership over production enterprises to ensure the comprehensive completion of the plans stipulated by the state in terms of the quantity, quality, variety, cost, and profit of products. The commercial sector must improve the organization of commodity sales, strive to expand the social commodity turnover, reduce commodity circulation costs, and ensure the completion of the commodity sales plan and profit remittance plan stipulated by the state. The relationship between industry and commerce should be adjusted appropriately. The work of materials allocation and supply should be actively improved. The capital construction sector must further improve design and construction work and strive to save building materials on the premise of ensuring project quality, and complete the capital construction tasks stipulated by the state more, faster, better, and more economically.
    The 1956 National Budget is a guarantee for striving to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country, a guarantee for continuing to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, and a guarantee for strengthening the national defense forces of our country. It reflects the common will of the people of all nationalities in our country to build socialism and reflects the deep desire of our people to build the motherland peacefully. The Budget Committee recommends that the National People's Congress approve this budget.

    第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会
    关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的审查报告
    （1956年6月28日第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会通过）
    全国人民代表大会预算委员会主任委员　刘澜涛
    第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会，听了国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念
  “关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，研究了大会代表们对于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的意见，审查了1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算。
    在审查1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的过程中，预算委员会曾根据大会代表提出的意见，向政府提出了咨询，并进行了讨论。现在，我代表预算委员会将审查的结果，归纳为几个问题说明如下：
    一、关于1955年决算收入和
        1956年预算收入的问题
    在1955年国家决算中，工商税收和商业收入都没有完成原批准的预算；少收的原因，除同意李先念副总理兼财政部长在“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”中所作的分析外，预算委员会认为，还应该指出商业工作上的缺点。1955年国营商业的收入计划没有完成，除了同市场情况的变化和任务规定的过大有关外，商业部门本身工作的缺点也是重要的原因。例如，城乡商业网还组织得不好，商品供应不及时，往往这里积压、那里脱销；商品保管调运中的损失浪费仍然不少；等等。对于这些缺点，商业部门应该努力加以克服。
    1956年国家预算规定，公私合营企业以本年收入抵补本年支出以后，还要完成向国家上缴2亿元的任务。在讨论中，有的代表提出，公私合营企业本身需要发展，目前给国家预算担负上缴任务，是否适宜？关于这个问题，预算委员会向政府提出咨询后，经过研究认为以公私合营企业本身的收入抵拨投资后，给国家预算担负2亿元的上缴任务是有可能的。
    二、关于基本建设方面厉行节
          约的问题
    1955年在基本建设中厉行节约、反对浪费的成绩是很大的。由于在基本建设中厉行节约的结果，国家节约了资金达10亿元以上，并且在1955年利用节约下来的资金，增办了限额以上的工程60多个。1955年厉行节约的另一个显著成绩，就是克服了当时相当普遍存在的铺张浮华、讲求排场的不良风气。但是，应该指出，在贯彻节约措施中，也发生了一些偏差。主要是在削减基本建设投资的时候，缺乏全面的安排，以致有些工程中途停工，造成了窝工浪费的现象；过多地削减了某些非生产性建设投资，对于职工住宅和为工业基地服务的辅助性建筑注意得不够；在降低建筑造价方面，也有某些不合理的地方，因而使得有些建筑物标准过低，不合实用，有些工程质量很坏。例如，有些医院的建筑造价降得过低，不能符合医院的需要。又如，北京清河制呢厂新建厂房的屋顶太薄，不能防寒，去年冬天就已经淋水；这个厂子去年新建的职工宿舍，也因为造价降得过低和施工中有缺点，墙壁已经裂缝，屋顶已经漏雨。关于这些方面的缺点，大会代表们提出了不少的批评，预算委员会认为这些批评是正确的。
    预算委员会认为，节约是社会主义资金积累的一种重要方法，今后在基本建设方面必须继续加以贯彻实施。但是，在实施节约的过程中，应当同时注意防止可能发生的片面追求节约，忽视工程质量等偏向，否则，对国家的建设事业同样会带来损害。因此，在基本建设中必须认真执行“适用、经济、可能的条件下讲求美观”的方针。对于职工住宅及其他辅助性的建筑，应当积极地有步骤地加以解决；凡建筑标准降低得不合理的，应当加以修改。除此以外，有的代表还提出了城市建设规划和沿海城市的市政建设问题。预算委员会认为，今后城市建设应当有统一的规划，机关、学校、工厂和市内的公用建筑都必须作合理的安排，如果布局不当，将来同样会造成损失。沿海城市有许多是我国原有的工业基地，应该充分加以利用，对这些城市的市政建设投资，也应当给以适当的照顾。
    三、关于社会文教费方面的问
          题
    在社会文教费方面，大会代表们提出的问题主要有两个：一是1955年社会文教费结余较多的问题；一是有关卫生经费方面的问题。
    预算委员会曾对1955年社会文教费结余进行了审查。社会文教费所以结余较多，主要有以下几个原因：（1）1955年基本建设削减项目，降低造价，基本建设任务没有完成计划，一部分向国外订购的设备也没有按时到达，共结余经费28，200多万元；（2）削减了招生计划，结余经费10，300多万元；（3）农业丰收，传染病减少，救济费和防疫费减少了支出，共结余经费9，500多万元。此外，文教卫生部门在执行1955年预算过程中，厉行了节约，也节省了一部分资金。预算委员会认为，1955年文教卫生经费结余较多，主要是因为基本建设未能按计划完成，这虽然是和去年在厉行节约中对基本建设缺乏全面的安排有关，但是从文教卫生部门历年的基本建设来看，还由于有“当年设计，当年施工，排队在后”等等原因，都是完成得比较差的，这也是必须加以解决的一个问题。为了改变这种状况，今后文教卫生部门的基本建设，应当由负责设计、施工的部门和物资供应部门作更妥善的安排。其次，削减招生计划，也是造成经费结余较多的一个原因，而其中某些削减则是不够妥当的。
    关于卫生经费方面的问题，预算委员会也进行了研究。在1955年卫生经费的管理上，确有不少缺点。一方面，卫生经费结余较多，仅病床补助费就有1，800万元没有花出去；另一方面，医疗事业单位的收费标准却又偏高。产生这种情况的原因，主要是经费管理制度对事业单位限制过严，在执行中缺乏灵活性，医院的收费标准缺乏控制，并且有不正确的营利观点。预算委员会认为，卫生经费的管理制度今后必须改进；医院的收费标准应该适当降低，严格加以控制；并且应该进一步改善医院的管理，克服各种浪费现象。收费标准降低后，医院本身收入减少，国家预算应该增加一些补助。
    四、关于农民负担和乡村小学
        经费的问题
    1956年国家预算中规定，随同农业税附征的地方自筹收入，由原来不超过农业税正税的12％提高到最多不超过22％。增加的收入，用来解决一部分乡村小学经费。在讨论过程中，有些代表提出，地方自筹收入增加，农民负担是否过重？预算委员会根据政府提供的材料来看，目前农民负担是不算重的。在1953至1955年三年中国家对农民实行了稳定负担的政策，把农业税的税额稳定在1952年的水平上，这个政策对于促进农民增加生产、改善生活，已经收到了良好的效果。1956年把地方自筹占农业税正税的比例，从不超过12％提高到最多不超过22％，在农业生产发展的基础上，农民负担仍然没有超过1952年的负担水平。农业税正税和地方自筹收入占农业产量的百分比，1952年为13.2％，1953年为12.12％，1954年为12.94％，1955年为11.54％，而1956年预计为11.4％。这说明今年增加一部分地方自筹收入是可行的。但是，用于解决乡村小学经费的地方自筹收入，应该按照国务院的规定，由省市人民委员会掌握分配，统一调剂使用，不应该交给农业生产合作社去自筹办理。有的农业生产合作社自己愿意而又有力量自办的可以例外。至于今后乡村小学教育经费是否列入地方预算，可以留待国务院在研究解决事业管理体制和财政管理体制的时候，统一加以考虑。
    五、有关财政管理制度方面的
          问题
    关于财政管理制度问题，预算委员会同意李先念副总理兼财政部长在“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”中所指出的缺点。预算委员会认为，国家财政管理制度既要保证国家财政的统一计划和统一领导，也要充分发挥各级各部门的积极性。随着国家建设事业的发展和情况的变化，财政管理制度也应当作相应的修改，以便更好地体现这一原则。目前在财政管理制度上的主要问题是中央财政和地方财政的职权范围不够明确，财政部门和各企业、事业部门的财务管理职权也不够明确，中央财政对地方财政管得过细、过严，在制度上也缺乏某些灵活性的规定。因此，在国家预算执行过程中，一方面有些项目有钱花不出去，另一方面，有些应该解决的问题又未能解决，在资金分配和使用上造成了某些不合理现象。这种情况的存在，已在一定程度上影响了某些事业的发展，也在一定程度上影响了各级各部门的积极性。预算委员会认为，在研究财政体制的时候，应该妥善地解决这些问题。
    以上就是预算委员会对1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算中若干问题的审查意见。预算委员会认为，大会代表们对国家预算提出的许多问题，都是应该解决的。当然，在解决这些问题的时候，还应该根据国家的财力，在保证重点建设的原则下，分别轻重缓急，逐步地求得解决，而并不是要求，同时也不可能一下子全部解决。
    预算委员会认为，1955年国家决算的总收入为30，357，976，000元，总支出为29，346，938，000元，年终结余为1，011，038，000元，是大体适当的，1955年国家决算的情况基本上是良好的，建议全国人民代表大会批准这个决算。1956年国家预算的总收入30，742，770，000元，其中本年收入29，731，732，000元，上年结转收入1，011，038，000元；总支出30，742，770，000元，收支平衡。预算委员会认为，1956年国家预算总收入和总支出作这样的安排是适当的。鉴于国家预算涉及到国民经济活动的各个方面，情况复杂，某些变化事前很难预计，为了更好地执行1956年国家预算，预算委员会认为，如果在国家预算执行过程中，情况有了变化，国务院可以根据全国人民代表大会批准的预算方针作某些必要的调整，并且在一定时期，向全国人民代表大会常务委员会报告。
    1956年国家预算收支的安排是积极的，是比较可靠的。1956年国家预算的胜利完成，就可以加快我国社会主义建设的速度。1956年国家预算的特点是收入和支出都增长得很快。在收入方面，来自国营企业的收入，包括企业上缴的利润和交纳的税款在内，占本年收入的74.34％；在支出方面，基本建设投资额将达到140亿元，超过了以往任何一年的投资数额。这说明要完成1956年国家预算，必须作一番巨大的努力。继续坚持增产节约的努力，是实现1956年国家预算的基本保证。为此目的，工业部门必须对生产企业进一步加强领导，保证在产品的数量、质量、品种、成本和利润等方面，全面完成国家规定的计划。商业部门必须改善商品销售的组织工作，努力扩大社会商品流转额，降低商品流转费用，保证完成国家规定的商品销售计划和利润上缴计划。工商关系应当作适当的调整。物资分配和供应工作，应当积极加以改进。基本建设部门必须进一步改善设计和施工工作，并且要在保证工程质量的前提下努力节约建筑材料，又多、又快、又好、又省地完成国家规定的基本建设任务。
    1956年国家预算是争取提前完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的保证，是继续提高人民物质和文化生活水平的保证，也是增强我国国防力量的保证。它反映了我国各族人民建设社会主义的共同意志，反映了我国人民和平建设祖国的深切愿望。预算委员会建议全国人民代表大会批准这个预算。
