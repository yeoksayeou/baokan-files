    Prevent Losses of Spring Harvest Crops
    This year, Guizhou Province has achieved a bumper harvest of spring crops. However, some areas are already experiencing losses due to untimely harvesting or improper storage after harvesting. In Liangcai Township, Xishui County, a high-level cooperative has over one hundred "shi" of wheat and eighty-eight "shi" of rapeseed rotting in the fields, some of which have already sprouted. In Liu Guan Township, Zhenning County, two cooperatives did not assign specific personnel to manage the harvested wheat, resulting in haphazard stacking and spoilage of more than one "shi." The Xixiang Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town of the same county piled wheat on both sides of the street, causing all the wheat to become soaked and swollen from rainwater. In addition, losses caused by careless harvesting, such as dropped ears and threshing, are also significant.
    These phenomena should attract the attention of agricultural cooperatives in various regions. We must not allow the fruits of our labor to suffer any losses once they are in our hands.

    不让小春作物受损失
    今年贵州省小春作物普遍丰收。但是目前一些地区因为收割不及时或收割以后保管不好，已经造成了损失。鰼水县良材乡一个高级社，有一百多石小麦和八十八石油菜籽在地里烂着，其中一部分已经生了芽。镇宁县刘关乡的两个合作社，收下来的小麦没有专人负责保管，乱堆乱放，已经霉烂了一石多。这个县城关镇西乡农业合作社把小麦堆在街道两旁，麦子全部被雨水淋湿发胀。此外，因收割不仔细而掉穗脱粒，造成的损失也不小。
    这些现象，应该引起各地农业合作社的注意。到了手边的劳动果实，不能让它受一点损失。
