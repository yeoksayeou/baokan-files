Xi'an Children's Swimming Pool Opens on "June 1st"
    Xi'an's first children's swimming pool opened to young swimming enthusiasts on June 1st.

    At 9:30 in the morning, warm sunlight shone on the emerald green water surface, and the mushroom-shaped fountain in the pool was spraying water. At this time, the first batch of young guests arrived. Students from Dongqilu, Dongyangshi, and other elementary schools were the first to dive into the water like fish, swimming and splashing. Then, groups of children went into the water, playing water fights and games around the fountain, or practicing backstroke and freestyle.

    This children's swimming pool can accommodate more than two hundred young swimming enthusiasts at the same time.

    西安少年游泳池“六一”开放
    西安市第一座少年游泳池，六月一日开始接待少年游泳爱好者。
    上午九时半，温暖的阳光照射着碧绿的水面，池中蘑菇式的喷泉在喷着水，这时第一批少年客人来到了。东七路、东羊市等小学的学生首先像鱼一样地钻进水里，泼剌泼剌地游起来。接着，少年们三五成群地下到水里，在喷泉的四周打水仗，作游戏，或者练习仰泳、自由泳。
    这座少年游泳池可以同时接待二百多个少年游泳爱好者。
