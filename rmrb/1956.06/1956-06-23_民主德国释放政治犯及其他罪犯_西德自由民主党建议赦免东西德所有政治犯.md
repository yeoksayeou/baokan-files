Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 22nd - The Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic announced on the 21st that East Germany has released and will release many criminals.

The decision of the state organs of the German Democratic Republic regarding the release of criminals was made based on suggestions from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, various democratic parties, and people's organizations regarding consolidating the democratic legal system and further democratization. The decision points out: 1. As of June 19th, 691 Social Democratic Party members who had committed crimes have been released; 2. Through amnesty or conditional suspended sentences, 11,896 people serving sentences for criminal and other offenses have been released. 3,169 people sentenced to one year or less for minor offenses have been granted probation; 3. Hitler's war criminals sentenced by Soviet military tribunals or German courts, including war criminals transferred by Soviet authorities, have been released. As of June 19th, 3,308 war criminals had been released.

At the same time, the judicial authorities of the German Democratic Republic are drafting revisions and supplementary provisions to the criminal law, which are to be submitted to the People's Chamber for review in the next few days. The draft stipulates some new punishments—public censure and probation—and clearly defines political crimes such as treason, espionage, and propaganda hostile to the political and social system of the German Democratic Republic.

Justice Minister Benjamin pointed out that the draft revisions and supplementary provisions to the criminal law will enable the judicial authorities to apply educational methods more appropriately to the people who commit crimes, while also having a powerful weapon to fight against the agents of imperialist spy organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 22nd - According to a report by the German Press Agency: The West German Free Democratic Party suggested on June 19th that all political prisoners in West Germany and the German Democratic Republic be granted amnesty.

The West German Free Democratic Party suggested that the parliamentary groups of the Free Democratic Party in the two Germanies submit bills to their respective parliaments for the amnesty of political prisoners. Currently, the chairman of the West German Free Democratic Party, Dehler, has sent a bill on amnesty to the parliamentary group of the Free Democratic Party in the German Democratic Republic.

The West German Free Democratic Party's proposal has been sharply opposed by the West German government.

    民主德国释放政治犯及其他罪犯
    西德自由民主党建议赦免东西德所有政治犯
    新华社柏林22日电　德意志民主共和国总理新闻处二十一日宣布，民主德国已经释放和将要释放许多罪犯。
    民主德国国家政权机关关于释放罪犯的决定，是根据德国统一社会党、各民主党派和人民团体关于巩固民主法制和进一步民主化的建议作出的。这个决定指出：一、到六月十九日为止，已经释放犯有罪行的社会民主党员691人；二、经过赦免或有条件的缓刑，释放因犯有刑事和其他罪行而服刑的11，896人。因犯轻罪而被判刑一年以内的3，169人已经获得缓刑；三、释放由苏联军事法庭或德国法庭判决的希特勒战争犯罪分子，其中包括由苏联机关移交过来的战犯。到六月十九日为止已经有3，308个战犯获得释放。
    同时，民主德国司法机构正在草拟刑法的修正和补充条款，准备在最近几天内提交人民议院审查。这个草案规定了一些新的处分——当众谴责和缓刑，并且明确地规定了叛国、从事间谍活动、和进行敌视德意志民主共和国政治和社会制度的宣传这样一些政治性犯罪的定义。
    司法部长本雅明指出，刑法修正和补充条款草案将使得司法机构可以更适当地对犯罪的人民运用教育的方法，同时又有一个有力的武器去同帝国主义间谍组织的代理人进行斗争。
    新华社柏林22日电　据德意志通讯社报道：西德自由民主党六月十九日建议在西德和德意志民主共和国赦免所有政治犯。
    西德自由民主党建议，两个德国的自由民主党议会党团分别向两国议会提出赦免政治犯的法案。目前西德自由民主党主席戴勒已经把一个关于赦免的法案送给民主德国的自由民主党议会党团。
    西德自由民主党的建议遭到了西德政府的尖锐反对。
