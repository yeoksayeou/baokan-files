    The Train Changes the Face of Mawei Town
    Qing Tian
    Taking the Qian-Gui Railway train from Jinchengjiang in Guangxi and traveling 153 kilometers north, you arrive at Mawei on the border of Guizhou Province.

    Mawei is a small town with only 1,900 people. Since the opening of the railway, this town has become a new loading and unloading point on the Qian-Gui Railway. The material transit agencies of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces have moved here from Jinchengjiang. Every day, a large number of machines and other industrial products are transported from all over the country, then loaded onto hundreds of cars and transported to all corners of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. In the past, due to the insufficient number of trailer trucks, many large machines could not be transported to various places in a timely manner, and some were stockpiled in Jinchengjiang. Now, the transportation mileage of trucks has been shortened, accelerating the turnaround of large trailers, with the result that many factories have received new equipment on time. Before the railway officially opened, many new-style farm tools passed through Mawei and were delivered to farmers of all ethnic groups, supporting spring plowing production. Various local specialties, grains, raw materials, and draught cattle produced in Guizhou Province are also continuously loaded onto trains here and transported to other places. Now, the freight cost per ton of grain has been reduced by thirty yuan compared to the past.

    In the state-owned trading companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and joint state-private stores in Mawei, new goods are constantly being added. The sales volume of the supply and marketing cooperative in April was equivalent to one-third of the total sales volume for the entire last year, and May saw a significant increase compared to April. New hotels and restaurants have been built near the station. The trading company has built a comprehensive store at the freight yard specifically for the transport, loading, and unloading workers, which will soon open for business. In this store, you can buy daily necessities, eat various dishes and meals, and also get haircuts, take baths, and find accommodation. The place where this store is located was a field just two months ago, and now buildings have appeared, and new houses are still being built. This is more than two kilometers away from the new street in Mawei.

    Mawei is constantly changing. The entire Guizhou will also become more prosperous with the construction of several railways.

    火车改变了麻尾镇的面貌
    庆田
    从广西金城江坐黔桂路的火车，向北行驶153公里，便到了贵州省边境上的麻尾。
    麻尾是一个只有一千九百人的小镇。通车以后，这个小镇成了黔桂路上的一个新的装卸点。云南、贵州两省的物资转运机构，已经从金城江搬到这里。每天有大量的机器和其他工业品从全国各地运来，然后又装上数以百计的汽车，运到云南、贵州两省的各个角落。过去由于拖板汽车不够用，许多大型的机器不能及时地运往各地，一部分被积压在金城江。现在汽车的运输里程缩短了，加快了大拖车的运转次数，结果使不少工厂都按时得到了新装备。在铁路没有正式营业以前，很多新式农具就经过麻尾，送到了各族农民手里，支援了春耕生产。贵州省出产的各种土特产、粮食、原料、耕牛，也源源不绝地从这里装上火车外运。现在每一吨粮食的运费，比过去降低了三十元。
    在麻尾的国营贸易公司、供销合作社和公私合营商店里，新的商品不断增加。供销合作社四月份的营业额相当于去年全年营业额的三分之一，五月份比四月份还有很大的增加。车站附近盖了新的旅馆、饭店。贸易公司在货物站为转运、装卸的职工专门修建了一个综合商店，很快就要开始营业。在这个商店里，可以买到日用百货，吃到各种菜饭，还可以理发、洗澡和住宿。这个商店所在的地方，两个月前还是一片田野，现在已经出现了一幢幢房屋，新的房屋还在继续修建。这里离麻尾新街足足有两公里多。
    麻尾还在不断地变化着。整个贵州也将随着几条铁路的修建，变得更加繁荣。
