Before the performance began, the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the state mounted the reviewing stand. At precisely 10:00 a.m., after the Soviet national anthem was played and a salute fired, the thrilling performance lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. The skills of the Soviet aviation athletes, military aircraft pilots, and parachutists won cheers from the audience. Many new jet aircraft appeared in the skies above the airport. These included Antonov and Tupolev jet airliners, and Yakovlev, Mikoyan, and Sukhoi jet fighters. The speed and performance of these new aircraft attracted widespread attention and discussion.
