I have listened to the report by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier and Minister of Finance of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget; the explanation by Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, on the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives; the work report by Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China; and read the communique of the State Statistical Bureau of the People's Republic of China on the results of the implementation of the 1955 national economic plan. I fully agree with and support the above reports and explanations.

Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, like the people of the whole country, have achieved unprecedented great achievements in politics, economy, and culture. The economic and cultural life of all ethnic groups has fundamentally changed from its past appearance. Especially the achievements made in implementing ethnic and religious policies are very exciting. Because of these achievements, the old ethnic relations have been fundamentally changed. The songs of the people of all ethnic groups loving the motherland, loving the Communist Party, and loving Chairman Mao can be heard everywhere. At the same time, the policy of national regional autonomy has been implemented. In addition to the establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, eleven ethnic autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties such as the Kazakh have been established. This is a major event of great significance unprecedented in the history of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. This has further strengthened the unity among all ethnic groups and enhanced the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups to be "masters of their own affairs." At present, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are enthusiastically participating in the socialist construction and socialist transformation. We are marching towards a socialist society.

Thanks to the kind concern of the Party, more than 30,000 cadres of various ethnic minorities have been trained and promoted. Autonomous organs at all levels and governments at all levels are dominated by ethnic minority cadres to carry out work and handle internal affairs of their own ethnic groups. Party organizations at all levels have also promoted and trained a large number of outstanding ethnic minority cadres to take on work. At the same time, in order to transition to a socialist society, the people of all ethnic minorities in Xinjiang warmly welcome the assistance of the Han people and all ethnic groups of the motherland in all aspects.

National equality, fraternity, and unity have become the highest principles of the people of all ethnic groups and strata. The people of all ethnic groups have been able to resolutely struggle against all phenomena that violate this highest principle in order to strengthen national unity and ensure the smooth progress of our socialist transformation and socialist construction.

In the past few years, party committees and governments at all levels have correctly implemented the Party and Chairman Mao's policy of freedom of religious belief. At the same time, the Constitution and laws clearly stipulate "protecting freedom of religious belief." This provision has been warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups, thereby strengthening the unity among all ethnic groups and religious sects. Due to the correct implementation of the policy of freedom of religious belief, every Muslim and other religious believers in Xinjiang are living their religious lives freely and happily. Since the in-depth socialist transformation movement, our religious activities have still been protected by the government, and religious figures have also enthusiastically supported and participated in socialist transformation and various construction undertakings. Many religious figures have gloriously joined agricultural production cooperatives and become members of the cooperatives. They have also been welcomed and cared for by the members.

With the help of the China Islamic Association, Muslims in Xinjiang participated in the national Muslim pilgrimage delegation to Mecca. The government provided great convenience to the pilgrimage delegation, and I also went to Mecca as a member of the pilgrimage delegation. We met Muslim brothers from other countries around the world, which further strengthened our understanding and friendship.

The vast majority of the population in Xinjiang believes in Islam, and there are also many full-time personnel engaged in religious activities. Under the guidance of the Party and the government's policy of freedom of religious belief, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has also established a preparatory committee for the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Islamic Association so that our religious figures can handle religious issues themselves.

Like other people from all walks of life, religious figures in Xinjiang voluntarily and enthusiastically participate in learning to improve their patriotic ideology and socialist awareness. Religious figures have also participated in visiting groups from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Xinjiang, visited industrial construction and other construction undertakings in many areas of the motherland, and have become more aware of the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, thereby receiving practical education and further strengthening national unity.

Based on my inspection of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, I would like to put forward some personal opinions on the following issues:

First, it is necessary to continue to conduct publicity and education on ethnic policies to the people of all ethnic groups and to all cadres, and earnestly respect the customs and habits of all ethnic groups, so as to ensure that the principle of national unity and friendship is not affected in any way. Due to the rapid development of socialist construction in our country, the exchanges between the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, especially the Han people, and the ethnic minorities in the border areas will increase even more in the future. In order to help the ethnic minorities eliminate the de facto inequality, it is very necessary to conduct organized and universal publicity and learning of the Party's ethnic policies among the people of all ethnic groups and the Han people and Han cadres in the country, so as to better help the ethnic minorities living in the border areas of the motherland to rapidly change the de facto inequality.

Second, national regional autonomy has been realized in Xinjiang, and autonomous organs have been established, but the various autonomous rights stipulated in the Constitution have yet to be earnestly and actively implemented. In order to make socialist industrial construction proceed rapidly, we hope to give us more care and assistance in economic, cultural, and transportation construction.

Third, we Xinjiang Muslims are fortunate to live in the Mao Zedong era. We have enjoyed complete freedom in religious belief. Therefore, we fully believe that the Party and the government's policy of freedom of religious belief is long-term and will not change. Our religious life should be closely integrated with the socialist construction and socialist transformation undertakings of the motherland. We also realize that only on the basis of the development of mass production can the lives of our religious figures be more guaranteed. However, because our religious figures were very backward in politics and in other aspects in the past, we must strengthen learning to improve our ideological awareness. We hope that the Party and the People's Government will give us the due care and help in this regard.

    新疆各族人民团结得更加紧密了
    ——伊敏·马合苏木代表的发言
    我听取了中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，中华人民共和国农业部长廖鲁言关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长兼秘书长彭真关于中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，并阅读了中华人民共和国国家统计局关于1955年度国民经济计划执行结果的公报，我完全同意并拥护以上的报告和说明。
    新疆各族人民在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下同全国人民一样在政治、经济、文化各方面获得了空前未有的巨大成就，各族人民的经济文化生活已基本上改变了过去的面貌。尤其在贯彻执行民族政策和宗教政策方面所取得的成就，也是令人十分兴奋的。由于这些成就，因而根本上改变了旧的民族关系，各族人民热爱祖国，热爱共产党，热爱毛主席的歌声到处可以听见。同时贯彻执行了民族区域自治政策，除成立了新疆维吾尔自治区外，还成立了哈萨克等十一个民族区域自治州和自治县。这是新疆各族人民历史上从来未有过的，具有重大意义的一件大事情。这就更进一步加强了各民族之间的团结，提高了各民族人民自己“当家作主”的主动性。目前新疆各族人民正在踊跃地参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。正向着社会主义社会迈进。
    由于党的亲切关怀，已经培养提拔了3万余名各少数民族的干部，各级自治机关和各级政府都以民族干部为主体来进行工作，办理本民族内部的事务。各级党的组织也提拔培养了大批优秀的民族干部担任工作。同时新疆各少数民族人民为要过渡到社会主义社会，热忱的欢迎汉族人民和祖国各族人民对我们各方面的帮助。
    民族平等、友爱、团结已成为各族各阶层人民最高的原则。各族人民已经能够同一切违犯这一最高原则的现象进行坚决的斗争，以加强民族团结，保证我们社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业顺利的进行。
    几年以来，各级党委和政府正确执行了党和毛主席的宗教信仰自由的政策。同时在宪法和法律上明确规定了“保护宗教信仰自由”，这一规定得到了各族人民的热烈拥护，从而加强了各民族各教派之间的团结。由于信教自由政策的正确贯彻，新疆的每个伊斯兰教徒及其他宗教信仰者都在自由幸福的过着自己的宗教生活。自社会主义改造运动深入以来，我们的宗教信仰活动仍然受到政府的保护，宗教界人士也热烈支持和参加着社会主义改造和各项建设事业。许多宗教界人士已光荣的参加了农业生产合作社，成为合作社社员。他们并受到了社员的欢迎和照顾。
    新疆的穆斯林在全国伊斯兰教协会的帮助下，曾参加全国穆斯林朝觐团前往麦加朝罕，政府对朝觐团给予了很大的方便，我也作为朝觐团的一员前往朝罕。我们在那里同来自世界其他国家的穆斯林兄弟们见了面，从而进一步加强了我们之间的谅解与友谊。
    新疆绝大多数人口信仰伊斯兰教，从事宗教活动的专职人士也不少，在党和政府的宗教信仰自由政策的照耀下，新疆维吾尔自治区也成立了新疆维吾尔自治区伊斯兰教协会筹备委员会，以便我们宗教界人士自己办理有关宗教方面的问题。
    新疆宗教界人士也和其他各界人士一样，自愿地热情地参加学习，以提高爱国主义思想和社会主义觉悟。宗教界人士也曾参加新疆各族各界的参观团，参观了祖国许多地区的工业建设以及其他各项建设事业，更加认识到祖国的伟大与可爱，从而得到了实际教育，更加密切了民族团结。
    根据我视察伊犁哈萨克族自治州的了解，我想就下列几个问题提出一点个人意见：
    首先，必须继续向各族人民向全体干部进行民族政策的宣传教育，认真尊重各民族的风俗习惯，以保证民族团结友爱的原则不受任何影响。由于我国社会主义建设事业迅速的发展，祖国各民族人民尤其是汉族人民与边疆各少数民族的往来今后将更加增多了，为要帮助各少数民族消灭在事实上的不平等，在全国各族人民以及汉族人民和汉族干部中有组织的普遍的宣传学习一次党的民族政策是很有必要的，以便今后更好的帮助居住在祖国边疆地区的各少数民族人民迅速的改变事实上的不平等现象。
    其次，新疆地区的民族区域自治实现了，自治机关建立起来了，但是在宪法上规定的各项自治权利尚有待认真的积极的予以实施。为要使社会主义工业建设迅速进行，在经济、文化、交通运输建设方面希望能给我们以更多的照顾和帮助。
    第三，我们新疆穆斯林幸运的生活在毛泽东时代，在宗教信仰上我们已享受到完全自由，因而我们完全相信党和政府的信教自由的政策是长期的不会改变。我们的宗教生活应同祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业密切结合起来，我们也认识到只有在群众生产发展的基础上，我们宗教人士的生活才会更加有保障，但由于我们宗教人士过去在政治上和在其他各方面都很落后，所以必须加强学习提高思想觉悟。希望党和人民政府在这方面给予我们以应有的关怀和帮助。
