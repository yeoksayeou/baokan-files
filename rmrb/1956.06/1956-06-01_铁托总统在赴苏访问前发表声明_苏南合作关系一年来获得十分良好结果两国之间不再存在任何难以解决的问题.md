Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 31st - According to TASS: Yugoslav President Tito, before making an official visit to the Soviet Union, stated, "It should be considered that our visit to the Soviet Union is the result of the extremely rapid normalization of relations between our two countries and the establishment of friendly cooperative ties." He pointed out that the Soviet-Yugoslav talks held a year ago and the joint declaration issued on the results of the talks played a particularly large role in this regard.

Tito said, "We are very satisfied with this visit because we are convinced that we will not only have the opportunity to fully exchange views on various issues of interest to our two countries and on international issues, but also have the opportunity to see the great achievements the Soviet Union has made in the post-war period."

"At the same time, we are going to the Soviet Union with great satisfaction—a country with which we are connected by past common struggles and common sufferings, a country that has won the high esteem of all ethnic groups in our country due to the great sacrifices it suffered in the last war against fascist aggressors."

Tito's statement was made on May 30th in response to a request from the TASS correspondent in Belgrade. He said that all clauses related to Soviet-Yugoslav relations in the Soviet-Yugoslav joint declaration issued a year ago have been fully implemented. The relations between our two countries have acquired a very clear and stable character. In this year, all factors that might cast doubt on this character of our relations have been almost completely eliminated. Speculations spread by some people, such as the so-called danger that Yugoslavia is about to lose its independence, have lost their basis.

Tito said, "There are no longer any major and difficult problems to solve between us. We have effectively eliminated almost all the negative things accumulated in the past, and both sides have drawn conclusions from this and paved the way for comprehensive cooperation in economic, political, and cultural fields."

He said that the current economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has achieved very good results, and we are completely satisfied with these results, especially since we have to consider that this has not yet reached its peak, and there is still the possibility of further expanding and deepening economic cooperation, which will further consolidate our mutual trust.

Speaking of the cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, Tito said that this cooperation is currently only at the beginning of its development. He believes that there are currently no obstacles sufficient to prevent the further expansion and strengthening of this cooperation.

Tito then said that as for the cooperation between our two countries on foreign policy issues, I believe that the results achieved in this regard so far cannot be underestimated. Because on major issues such as disarmament, collective security, active peaceful coexistence, consolidating peace, and international economic and cultural cooperation, the two countries hold common views. Even if we still have different views on certain international events, the differences between the two sides are not fundamental. This is a normal phenomenon in the relations between countries pursuing independent foreign policies. He said, "Naturally, with the development of cooperation between the two sides on diplomatic issues, it will be possible to reach a consensus on those issues on which we currently do not agree."

Tito concluded by saying that if we analyze the foreign policy recently pursued by our government, which is mainly aimed at maintaining peace and international cooperation and establishing peaceful coexistence between countries with different domestic systems, I think there can be no doubt about the purpose of our visit and the desire to establish a more solid cooperation between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

    铁托总统在赴苏访问前发表声明
    苏南合作关系一年来获得十分良好结果
    两国之间不再存在任何难以解决的问题
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫总统铁托在前往苏联作正式访问以前发表声明说，“应当认为，我们访问苏联是我们两国关系极其迅速地正常化和建立了友好合作联系的结果。”他指出，一年前举行的苏南会谈和就会谈结果发表的联合宣言，在这方面起了特别大的作用。
    铁托说，“我们十分满意进行这次访问，因为我们深信，我们不但将有机会就我们两国感到兴趣的各种问题以及国际问题全面地交换意见，而且还将有机会参观苏联在战后时期所取得的伟大成就。”
      “同时，我们怀着极大的满意心情前往苏联——过去的共同斗争和共同苦难使我们同它发生联系的国家，前往由于在上一次反对法西斯侵略者的战争中遭受重大牺牲而获得我国各族人民崇高评价的国家。”
    铁托的声明是应塔斯社驻贝尔格莱德记者的请求在五月三十日发表的。他说，一年前发表的苏南联合宣言中所有同苏南两国的相互关系有关的条款都全部实行了。我们两国之间的关系获得了非常明朗和稳定的性质。在这一年内，一切可能使我们关系的这种性质遭到怀疑的因素，都几乎完全被铲除了。某些人所散布的所谓南斯拉夫面临势将失去自己独立地位的危险等等揣测之词，已经失去了根据。
    铁托说，“我们之间不再存在任何重大的和难以解决的问题。我们有效地消除了过去积累起来的几乎所有消极的东西，我们双方由此作出了结论，并且铺平了在经济、政治和文化方面全面合作的道路。”
    他说，目前苏南两国之间的经济合作获得了十分良好的结果，我们完全满意这种结果，特别是因为我们要考虑到，在这方面还没有发展到顶点，目前还有可能进一步扩大和加深经济合作，而这种合作将会更加巩固我们的相互信任。
    在谈到苏南两国的文化合作问题的时候，铁托说，这种合作目前还不过是处在发展的开端。他认为，目前没有任何障碍足以阻挠这种合作的进一步扩大和加强。
    铁托接着说，至于我们两国在外交政策问题方面的合作，我以为，在这方面到现在为止所获得的结果是不能低估的。因为在像裁军、集体安全、积极的和平共处、巩固和平、国际经济和文化合作这类重大的问题上，两国抱着共同的看法。我们对某些国际事件即使还有不同的看法，但是，双方的分歧是没有根本意义的。这是奉行独立外交政策的国家之间的关系上的正常现象。他说，“自然，随着双方在外交问题上的合作的发展，对那些我们现在看法还不一致的问题，是能够获得一致的看法的。”
    铁托最后说，如果分析一下我国政府最近奉行的、主要目的在于维护和平和国际合作以及国内制度不同的国家之间建立和平共处的外交政策，我认为，就决不能够怀疑我们这次访问的目的以及对建立南苏两国之间的更加巩固的合作的愿望。
