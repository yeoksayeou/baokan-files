The Young Pioneers Hydropower Station Starts Construction

The "Beijing Young Pioneers Hydropower Station" began construction on "June 1st" in Beihai Park, Beijing.

This is the first remotely controlled, automated hydropower station in our country provided for children to observe, learn, and operate themselves. After the hydropower station is completed, Young Pioneers only need to press a button in the "Children's Home," one kilometer away from the hydropower station, and the water turbine will quickly rotate, driving the generator. Children can also manufacture models of generators and motors in the electrical workshop attached to the hydropower station.

This hydropower station uses the drop in water level from Shichahai flowing into Beihai to generate electricity, with a power generation capacity of ten kilowatts. In addition to supplying the hydropower station's electrical workshop, it can also be used for lighting in the "Children's Home." The civil engineering, electromechanical installation, and mechanical and electrical equipment of this hydropower station are respectively constructed and supplied by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building.

At 4:00 PM on "June 1st," a "Beijing Young Pioneers Hydropower Station Groundbreaking Ceremony" was held in Beihai Park. Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Wang Lin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, and the children broke ground together. More than 50 outstanding workers and youth shock brigade members from the Guanting and Moshikou Hydropower Stations came to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony with their award flags, and they read out a guarantee to complete the construction of the Young Pioneers Hydropower Station on schedule. The hydropower station is planned to be completed on October 1st this year.

The Capital's Children Have a Tugboat

On the morning of "June 1st," a whistle sounded on the Houhe River in the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. A shallow-water tugboat, full of colorful signal flags, sprayed a wave from its stern as it performed rapid forward movement, slow backward movement, and left and right rotation maneuvers for its little masters.

This tugboat is the first domestically made water-jet shallow-water tugboat that was exhibited at the National Exhibition of Advanced Transportation Experience. Now, the Ministry of Communications has donated it to the children of the capital as a gift to celebrate "June 1st" International Children's Day.

On this morning, children wearing red scarves and brightly colored clothes poured into the Working People's Cultural Palace like a tide to attend the donation ceremony of the water-jet shallow-water tugboat to the children of the capital by the Ministry of Communications. At the meeting, Wang Chijun, Director of the Political Department of the Ministry of Communications, presented the donation certificate to the children on behalf of the Ministry of Communications and announced that the tugboat was named "Young Pioneer." He also encouraged the children to make good use of the tugboat to learn and study the knowledge of manufacturing and operating ships.

The children were extremely interested in the tugboat's maneuver performance, and the children on the shore and on the boat applauded and cheered again and again. Many children also lined up in long queues waiting to board the boat for a tour.

Opening Ceremony of the Children's Railway

The opening ceremony of China's first children's railway was held on "June 1st" simultaneously with the Harbin International Children's Day garden party and the naming ceremony of the children's park. Lü Qien, the Mayor of Harbin, granted four young drivers the right to drive and personally issued them driving licenses. After Mayor Lü Qien cut the ribbon in front of the small locomotive, a group of station staff dressed in gray serge suits and wearing armbands immediately busied themselves. The little ticket collectors began to punch tickets for passengers, and a group of innocent and lively children crowded Mayor Lü onto the train, while another group of children holding dolls and toys were pulled onto the train by their mothers. With a long whistle, the train began to move. The children on the train kept laughing and waving to the people on the platform. The train passed through a pear orchard, passed through flowerbeds, and entered a dense forest, and soon arrived at "Moscow Station." A group of female train attendants dressed in white dresses explained travel knowledge to the young passengers. The train stopped at "Moscow Station" for three minutes. After the little crossing guards and inspectors in gray work clothes inspected the tracks and locomotives with small hammers, the train continued to travel, and after fifteen minutes, it returned to "Beijing Station," and was warmly welcomed by the people along the way.

    让孩子们掌握更多的知识和技术
    少年先锋队水电站动工兴建
    “北京少年先锋队水电站”“六一”在北京北海公园动工兴建。
    这是我国供给少年儿童观摩、学习，并由他们自己操纵的第一个远距离控制的自动化的水电站。水电站建成以后，少先队员们只要在远距水电站一公里的“少年之家”一按电纽，水轮机迅速旋转，带动发电机转动。孩子们还可以在水电站附属的电工车间里，制造发电机、电动机等模型。
    这个水电站是利用什刹海的水流入北海的落差来发电的，发电能力为十瓩，除了供给水电站的电工车间使用外，还可供“少年之家”照明用。这个水电站的土木工程、机电安装以及机电设备等分别由电力工业部和第一机械工业部负责建筑和供给。
    “六一”下午四点钟，在北海公园举行了“北京少年先锋队水电站动工典礼大会”。北京市副市长吴晗、电力工业部副部长王林和孩子们一起动了土。建筑官厅和模式口水电站的五十多名优秀工人、青年突击队员举着他们得到的奖旗也来参加了开工典礼，他们宣读了如期完成少年先锋队水电站建筑工程的保证书。这座水电站计划在今年十月一日建成。
    首都少年儿童有了一艘拖轮
    “六一”上午，在北京劳动人民文化宫的后河上，呜呜的汽笛声响了，一艘挂满彩色信号旗的浅水拖轮的尾部喷出一股浪花，它正带着小主人在水上作急速前进、缓缓后退和左右旋转等操纵表演。
    这艘拖轮就是在全国交通先进经验展览会上曾经展出的我国自制的第一艘喷水式浅水拖轮。现在交通部把它赠送给首都少年儿童，作为庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的礼物。
    这天早上，戴着红领巾、穿着鲜艳衣服的少年儿童，像潮水一样涌进了劳动人民文化宫，来参加交通部赠给首都少年儿童喷水式浅水拖轮典礼大会。在会上，交通部政治部主任王赤军代表交通部，把赠送书送给孩子，并宣布这艘拖轮命名为“少年先锋号”，他还鼓励孩子们好好运用这艘拖轮，学习和研究制造和驾驶轮船的知识。
    孩子们对拖轮的操纵表演感到极大的兴趣，岸上和船上的孩子一次又一次鼓掌欢呼，许多少年儿童还排起长长的队伍等着上船游览。
    儿童铁路的通车典礼
    我国第一条儿童铁路通车典礼，“六一”这天和哈尔滨庆祝国际儿童节游园大会以及儿童公园命名仪式同时举行。哈尔滨市长吕其恩授予四个小司机行车权利，并亲手发给他们驾驶证书。吕其恩市长在小火车头前边剪彩以后，一群穿着灰色哔叽服戴着臂章的车站小工作人员立刻忙碌起来。小剪票员开始给乘客剪票，一群天真活泼的孩子拥着吕市长上了车，另一群抱着洋娃娃和玩具的孩子由妈妈拉着也登上了车。汽笛一声长鸣，火车开始移动了。车上的孩子们不停地向站台上的人们欢笑招手。火车穿过梨树园，经过花丛，进入了茂密的树林，一会儿就到了“莫斯科车站”。一群穿着洁白衣裙的女列车员向小旅客们解释旅行常识。火车在“莫斯科车站”停车三分钟，穿着灰色工作服的小道口管理员和检车员拿着小铁锤，检查过路轨和机车后，火车继续行驶，过十五分钟又回到了“北京车站”，一路上受到人们的热烈欢迎。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
