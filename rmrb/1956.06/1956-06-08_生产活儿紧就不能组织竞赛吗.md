Can't Labor Competitions Be Organized When Production is Tight?
By Our Reporter Wang Changlong
During the spring plowing season, the Anyang Cotton Farm in Henan Province launched a labor competition. The competition played an important role in ensuring the completion of the sowing task.
Before the cotton sowing, the Anyang Cotton Farm, after mobilizing the staff to discuss, specifically formulated twenty-six technical measures for cotton sowing, and issued a call to the staff to carry out labor competitions. Although the specific organization and leadership of the competition itself was not enough, due to the influence of the vigorously developing advanced producer movement throughout the country, the workers' labor enthusiasm was very high, and each team, group, and some individual workers formulated their own competition plans and actively took action. Many workers had new creations in the sowing process. This ensured the timely completion of the sowing plan for 3,153 mu of cotton. However, the leaders of the Anyang Cotton Farm did not promptly summarize the achievements and experiences of the labor competition in cotton sowing, strengthen the organization and leadership of the competition, and continue to push the competition movement forward.
Originally, the leaders of the Anyang Cotton Farm had a thought that placed labor competition in opposition to production. The farm director, Lu Tianshui, said: "We still had competition activities during the sowing period in our farm. Once the sowing is over, and the cotton seedlings emerge from the soil, thinning seedlings and eliminating topsoil hardening, etc., the work is too tight, and we can't spare time to organize labor competitions!" The farm's vice-director, Li Shang, and the chairman of the trade union, Wang Fuxue, participated in an inter-farm competition meeting in the province for more than twenty days. They returned to the farm on May 2nd, but did not convey the information to the staff until the 16th. Even the transmission at the farm affairs meeting was repeatedly delayed due to "other meetings and tight production work." In addition, the leaders of the cotton farm forgot about the staff in the offices when calling for labor competitions. In mid-April, the province notified the farm to organize people to check the competition. The leaders of the cotton farm temporarily convened a meeting of office staff in order to cope with the inspection, issued a call, and the office staff also made some competition plans, but no one asked about it afterwards.
Because the labor competition lacked strong leadership, the workers' soaring enthusiasm during sowing was not given timely and enthusiastic support. For example, Suo Jingyu, a worker in the mechanical engineering group, after three experiments during sowing, modified the sowing machine by adding a fertilizer applicator to the back, enabling the sowing machine to sow and fertilize simultaneously, promoting Xinjiang's cotton planting experience and saving labor. However, the leadership of the cotton farm did not promptly commend and promote it. If the workers' labor creations are treated in this way, how can the workers' enthusiasm and creativity not be frustrated? Worker Ren Binghuai said: "We have great enthusiasm for labor competition, but the leadership always ignores it. After cotton sowing, everyone feels a little discouraged." Another worker said: "Our farm has never commended advanced producers in the past, and is unwilling to promote the farm's advanced production experience." As the competition mood slackened, the workers' production efficiency was also affected. After the cotton seedlings emerged from the soil, the operation of eliminating topsoil hardening was originally scheduled to be completed in one and a half days, but it took seven or eight days and was still not finished. On May 13, the farm director Lu Tianshui inspected the elimination of hardening in the cotton fields and found that more than 80 mu of cotton fields had the cotton seedlings buried by soil because the cultivators were placed too wide during the operation, and people had to dig them out with their fingers. Lu Tianshui immediately lost his temper with the workers and technicians on the spot: "Who did this? We must investigate responsibility. If it was directed by a technician, they will be disciplined, and if it was done by a worker, they will be fired!" At this time, the people in the cotton field, watching the farm director get angry, looked at each other, and no one admitted that they had done it. As soon as the farm director turned around and walked away, a worker spoke up: "This is the leadership method of the farm director! Can scaring people solve the problem? To be honest, how much wasted labor and hidden work has there been these days!" The facts repeatedly remind the leaders of the Anyang Cotton Farm: stop stubbornly holding on to the idea that "production work is tight, and there is no time to organize labor competitions!" They should closely rely on the broad masses of employees, actively organize labor and production competitions, deeply discover problems, and solve problems, in order to complete this year's cotton production increase plan.

    生产活儿紧就不能组织竞赛吗
    本报记者　王昌隆
    春耕期间，河南省安阳棉场展开了劳动竞赛。竞赛在保证完成播种任务上起了重要的作用。
    在棉花播种以前，安阳棉场经过发动职工讨论，具体制定了二十六条棉花播种的技术措施，并且向职工提出了开展劳动竞赛的号召。虽然对竞赛本身的具体的组织领导还不够，可是，由于全国各地蓬勃发展的先进生产者运动的影响，工人的劳动热情很高，各队、组和一部分工人个人都制定了自己的竞赛计划，并且积极行动起来。在播种中有不少工人有新的创造。这就保证了3，153亩棉花播种计划的按时完成。但是，安阳棉场领导人员没有及时总结棉花播种中劳动竞赛的成绩和经验，加强对竞赛的组织领导，把竞赛运动继续推向前进。
    原来安阳棉场的领导人员有一种把劳动竞赛和生产对立起来的思想，场长卢天水说：“我们场里播种期间还有竞赛活动，播种一过，棉花一出土，疏苗、消灭表土板结等，活儿太紧，就顾不上组织劳动竞赛了！”棉场副场长李尚、工会主席王福学在省里参加了二十多天的场际竞赛会议，五月二日回到场里，一直到十六日没有向职工传达，甚至连在场务会议上的传达，也因为“有其它会议、生产活儿紧”，一再被拖下来。另外，棉场领导人员在号召开展劳动竞赛的时候，忘掉了科室人员。四月中旬省里通知要组织人到该场检查竞赛，棉场领导人员为了应付检查，临时召集科室人员开会，号召了一下，科室人员也订了一些竞赛计划，事后再也没人过问。
    由于劳动竞赛没有强有力的领导，播种中工人们高涨的热情，并没有得到及时的、热情的支持。如机务组工人索景瑜在播种中，经过三次试验，把播种机后边改装上了施肥器，使播种机随播种、随施肥，推行了新疆的植棉经验，节省了劳力。但是棉场的领导方面并没有及时表扬和推广。既是这样对待工人的劳动创造，工人们的积极性和创造性怎能不受挫折呢？工人员炳怀说：“我们劳动竞赛的劲头可大啦，可是领导上总不理睬，在棉花播种后，大家就有些泄气。”另一个工人说：“我们场里过去就不表扬先进生产者，不肯推广本场的先进生产经验。”竞赛情绪松懈了，工人的生产效率也就受到影响。棉苗出土后，消灭表土板结的作业原定一天半完成，但是干了七、八天，还没有干完。五月十三日，场长卢天水到棉田里检查消灭板结情况，发现八十多亩棉田因为作业中把中耕器放得宽了，棉苗被土埋压住，还得人们用手指往外扒。卢天水当场对工人和技术人员们发开了脾气：“这是谁干的？要追查责任，是技术人员指挥的要处分，是工人干的要开除！”这时在棉田里的人们，看着场长动火了，互相观望，谁也不承认是自己干的。场长刚返身走过去，有一个工人就开腔了：“这就是场长的领导方法！吓人能解决问题吗？说实话，这些天有多少背工、窝工的事情啊！”事实一再地在提醒安阳棉场的领导人员：不要再固执那种“生产活儿紧，顾不上组织劳动竞赛”的想法了！他们应该紧紧依靠职工群众，积极组织劳动生产竞赛，深入发现问题，解决问题，以完成今年的棉花增产计划。
