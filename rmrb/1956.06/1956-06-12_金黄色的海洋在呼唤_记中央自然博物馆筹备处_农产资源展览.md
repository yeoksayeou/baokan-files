The Golden Ocean Beckons
—A Record of the Central Museum of Natural History Preparatory Office's "Agricultural Resource Exhibition"—
By Our Reporter

The "Agricultural Resource Exhibition," sponsored by the Central Museum of Natural History Preparatory Office, opened in Beijing on June 1st.

Magnificent electric models gleam in the grain crop exhibition hall. From the cold Heilongjiang to the tropical Hainan Island, east from Taiwan, west to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, rice, wheat, and various coarse grains are distributed. Excellent rice varieties such as "Yinfang" from North China, "Shengli Xian" from Hubei, and "Tangpu Dwarf" from Guangdong are displayed here. For thousands of years, the working people of our country have cultivated more than 10,000 rice varieties that can adapt to various environments. Chao'an County in Guangdong, crisscrossed by rivers, is a nationally renowned high-yield rice county. In 1955, the county's average yield per mu for two seasons was more than 1,017 jin, an increase of 76.28% compared to 1949 before liberation. All regions are striving to create large-scale high-yield rice experience. The erected golden wheat stalks remind us that China's wheat production ranks second in the world. Currently, the average wheat yield per mu in our country is 114 jin, and the high yield per mu is 1,377 jin. From the wheat high-yield experience in Wugong County, Shaanxi, introduced here, it can be seen that the wheat yield per mu in our country can be greatly increased, so that the wheat yield per mu can catch up with and exceed the level of high yields. Our country has many kinds of coarse grains, and here we specially introduce the distribution and excellent varieties of corn, potatoes, sorghum, and millet. Among a group of large corn cobs, one called "Chunye No. 1" is the most eye-catching. It is more than a foot tall, and the grains are particularly large; its mother is called "Golden Queen" and its father is called "Huanong No. 1." Our country is the richest country in the world in producing vegetable oil. The output of oil crops such as soybeans, rapeseed, and sesame ranks first in the world; peanuts rank second only to India in the world. Here, people can clearly see the distribution of oil crops in our country. Soybeans are grown in almost all provinces in the north and south of our country, and the main producing areas are Northeast China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Perhaps no one can say completely what other uses soybeans have besides being used for oil extraction and food. Here, people can see the physical objects made from soybeans as raw materials: gasoline, rubber, enamel paint, candles, as well as medical ointments, hair oil, glycerin, soap, gunpowder, as well as paper, ping-pong balls, and a series of finished products from the food industry such as bread, biscuits, and assorted candies. The technical crop exhibition hall vividly tells people that from Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan Island in the south, from Taiwan in the far east to Xinjiang in the far west, cotton and hemp are distributed, and twenty-two provinces are silk-producing areas. Our country is the most suitable country for growing cotton, and here you can see the difference between upland cotton, sea island cotton, medium cotton, and herb cotton. A beautiful diorama tells people that the cotton fields operated by the military farms in the Manas River Basin of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, using advanced Soviet cotton planting technology, had an average yield of 400 jin per mu in 1955, and a maximum of 1,392 jin per mu. If the average cotton yield in the country is increased to such a level, the total cotton output in the country will be two and a half times higher than in 1955. As early as more than 3,000 years ago, the working people of our country knew about the cultivation and utilization of hemp. Our country has all the main types of hemp cultivated in various countries in the world, such as ramie, flax, hemp, jute, kenaf, sisal hemp, and wild hemp. You can see them here. Our country's ramie production ranks first in the world. Silk was first invented and used in our country and has a history of more than 4,000 years. There are many kinds of silkworms in our country, the most important of which are domestic silkworms and tussah silkworms, as well as castor silkworms, mountain silkworms, and heaven silkworms. Here, people can see various silkworms and the production process of silk. The exhibition of tea, tobacco, sugar crops, and fruits tempts people. Our country is the origin of tea trees in the world. Our country's tea area includes more than 600 counties in fifteen provinces. A long row of glass bottles contains "Qihong," "Ninghong," "Yihong," and "Dianhong" in black tea, and "Zhucha," "Zhenmei," "Longjing," and "Guapian" in green tea. Their shapes and colors are different, and their flavors are even more different. From the tobacco distribution map, it can be seen that our country's famous flue-cured tobacco producing areas are Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Yunnan, Guizhou, Liaoning and other provinces, and the annual output now ranks second in the world; Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and other provinces are famous sun-cured tobacco producing areas. Sugar cane from the south, more than a zhang high, and sugar beet produced in the north are listed together. It is rare in the world for a country to produce these two kinds of sugar-making raw materials at the same time. People may especially think of Taiwan, the sugar granary of the motherland, where there is an introduction to the distribution of sugarcane in Taiwan Province; the hardworking people of Taiwan once created a record of producing 1.4 million tons of sugar annually. Piles of citrus, apples, pears, grapes, bananas, pineapples, peaches, persimmons... compete for beauty and fragrance on a long table. Through thousands of years of efforts, the working people of our country have cultivated more than 100 kinds of fruits, which are spread all over the country, and are constantly supplying people's needs throughout the four seasons. Now we advocate "fruit trees on the mountains"! A diorama of developing fruit tree production in mountainous areas tells people that about 60% of our country's existing fruit trees are planted in mountainous and hilly areas. Opening up orchards in mountainous areas, as shown in the diorama, planting along contour lines, doing a good job in soil and water conservation projects, and managing well can result in high yields.
The technical crop exhibition hall finally introduces our country's medicinal material resources to people. From the Himalayas to the east coast, from Changbai Mountain to Hainan Island, from the Loess Plateau to the Black Earth Belt, in the deep mountains and dense forests of various provinces, on fertile land, and on both sides of rivers, rich medicinal materials grow everywhere. Our country's medicinal material types and production are the first in the world. It is estimated that there are about 3,000 kinds of medicinal materials in our country. Guangdong Province alone produces more than 550 kinds, and the province with the least production also produces more than 100 kinds. In a large glass cabinet, people can see specimens of various commonly used raw medicinal materials.

Facing such rich agricultural resources, what will the new socialist countryside of our country look like after 500 million farmers realize the "National Agricultural Development Program"? Here, a model of our country's new socialist countryside is specially exhibited. People see that at that time it will be: in the boundless fields, high-yield crops such as rice, corn, potatoes, cotton and oil crops will be cultivated; the utilization rate and labor productivity of rural labor will be fully utilized. When the harvest season comes, the vast farms will become a golden ocean. Agricultural technology promotion stations, supply and marketing cooperatives, newly built residential houses, schools, sports fields, etc. are arranged in a regular manner, making the golden ocean infinitely moving.

The golden ocean is beckoning: march towards agricultural science, increase agricultural resources, and vigorously support national industrialization.

    金黄色的海洋在呼唤
    ——记中央自然博物馆筹备处“农产资源展览”——
    本报记者
    中央自然博物馆筹备处主办的“农产资源展览”，六月一日在北京开幕了。
    一幅幅巨大的电动模型闪耀在粮食作物展览室。从寒冷的黑龙江直到热带的海南岛，东自台湾起，西到新疆维吾尔自治区，分布着水稻、小麦和各种各样的杂粮。华北的“银坊”，湖北的“胜利籼”，广东的“塘埔矮”等等水稻优良品种都陈列在这里。几千年来，我国劳动人民培植了一万多个能适应各种环境的水稻品种。河川交错的广东潮安县是全国闻名的水稻千斤县，1955年全县平均两季每亩产量是1，017斤多，比解放以前的1949年增产76.28％。各地都正为创造水稻大面积丰产经验而努力。竖立着的金黄色的小麦束令人想起，我国小麦产量占世界第二位。目前我国小麦平均每亩产量是114斤，高额产量每亩是1，377斤。从这里介绍的陕西武功县小麦丰产经验可以看到，我国小麦每亩产量还可以大大提高，使小麦每亩产量都赶上并且超过高额产量的水平。我国杂粮种类很多，这里特别介绍了玉米、薯类、高粱和谷子的分布情况和优良品种。一群大玉米棒中，一支称为“春叶一号”的最引人注意，它有一尺多高，颗粒特别大；它的母亲叫“金皇后”，父亲叫“华农一号”。我国是世界上产植物油最丰富的国家。大豆、油菜、芝麻等油料作物的产量，都占世界第一位；花生仅次于印度，占世界第二位。这里人们可以清楚地看到我国油料作物分布的情形。大豆在我国几乎南北各省都有，主要产区是东北和黄河中下游各省。大豆除了供榨油、食用以外还有什么用途，也许谁也说不完全。这里，人们可以看到大豆作为原料制成的实物：汽油、橡胶、磁漆、腊烛，还有医疗用的软膏、头油、甘油、肥皂、火药，还有纸、乒乓球，以及面包、饼干、什锦糖等等一系列食品工业的成品。技术作物展览室生动地告诉人们：北起黑龙江，南到海南岛，从最东边的台湾到最西边的新疆，分布着棉花和麻类，还有二十二个省都是蚕丝产区。我国是最适宜于种植棉花的国家，这里可以看到陆地棉、海岛棉、中棉和草棉的分别。一个美丽的布景箱告诉人们：新疆维吾尔自治区玛纳斯河流域的部队农场经营的棉田，采用苏联先进的植棉技术，1955年平均产量每亩四百斤，最高每亩达1，392斤。如果全国的棉花平均产量都提高到这样的水平，全国棉花的总产量就要比1955年提高两倍半。远在三千多年以前，我国劳动人民就已经知道麻的栽培利用。世界各国栽培的主要麻类，如苎麻、亚麻、大麻、黄麻、洋麻、龙舌兰麻、野麻等，我国都有。在这里可以看到它们。我国苎麻的生产占世界第一位。蚕丝是我国最早发明和利用的，已经有四千多年历史。我国蚕的种类很多，最主要的是家蚕、柞蚕，还有蓖麻蚕、山蚕、天蚕等。这里，人们可以看到各种蚕以及蚕丝的生产过程。茶叶、烟叶、糖料和水果的展览引诱着人们。我国是世界上茶树的原产地。我国茶区包括十五省六百多县。一长排玻璃瓶分别装着红茶中的“祁红”“宁红”“宜红”“滇红”，分别装着绿茶中的“珠茶”“珍眉”“龙井”和“瓜片”，它们形状颜色不同，风味更是各各不同。从烟叶分布图上可以看到，我国著名的烤烟产区是山东、河南、安徽、云南、贵州、辽宁等省，年产量现在占世界第二位；浙江、广东、江西、湖北、湖南、四川等省，是著名的晒烟产区。来自南方的一丈多高的甘蔗和北方出产的甜菜并列一起。一个国家同时出产这两种制糖原料，是世界上极少有的。人们也许会特别想起祖国的糖库台湾，这里有台湾省甘蔗分布情况的介绍；勤劳的台湾人民，曾经创造过年产糖一百四十万吨的纪录。成堆的柑桔、苹果、梨、葡萄、香蕉、菠萝、桃、柿……在一个长条案上争艳比香。我国劳动人民经过几千年来的努力培育出一百多种果品，遍及全国各地，四季不断地供应着人们的需要。现在提倡“果树上山”！一个发展山区果树生产的布景箱告诉人们，我国现有果树约有60％以上栽在山区和丘陵地区。在山区开辟果园，如像在布景箱所表示的，等高栽植，作好水土保持工程，管理得好，可以得到高额的产量。
    技术作物展览室最后向人们介绍我国药材资源。从喜马拉雅山到东海岸，从长白山到海南岛，从黄土高原到黑土地带，在各省的深山密林间，肥沃的土地上，河流的两岸，到处都生长着丰富的药材。我国药材种类之多、产量之富，都是世界第一。估计我国药材约有三千多种，广东一省就产五百五十多种，最少的省也产一百多种。在一个大玻璃柜中，人们可以看到各种最常用的药材的生药标本。
    面对着这样丰富的农产资源，五亿农民实现“全国农业发展纲要”以后，我国社会主义的新农村将是什么样子呢？这里特展出一座我国社会主义新农村的模型，人们看到那时将是：在一望无际的田野中，栽培着高产作物水稻、玉米、薯类、棉花和油料作物；农村劳动力利用率和劳动生产率得到最充分的发挥。收获季节到来，广大农庄变成了金黄色的海洋。农业技术推广站、供销合作社、新建的居民住宅、学校、体育场等有规律地排列着，把金黄色的海洋打扮得无比动人。
    金黄的海洋在呼唤：向农业科学进军，增产农业资源，大力支援国家工业化。
