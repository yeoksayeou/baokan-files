The Central Academy of Arts and Crafts to be Established

(Our Dispatch) A higher art school—the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts—will be officially established in Beijing. This is the first higher art and craft school in our country specifically established to cultivate arts and crafts talents.

The Central Academy of Arts and Crafts is being established on the original foundation of the Arts and Crafts Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and will be jointly led by the Central Handicraft Bureau, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives. Currently, three departments—Dyeing and Weaving Technology, Ceramic Technology, and Decoration Design—are being established first, all with a five-year program, and are now beginning to enroll students. Students will not only study general basic art courses here, but also learn the professional technology of arts and crafts, requiring them to reach a certain level of artistic cultivation and master advanced professional production and scientific knowledge. Therefore, this school will formulate new teaching plans and syllabuses, and establish professional teaching and research offices and practical training institutions according to the plan. In the next few years, the school also plans to successively open departments such as Interior Decoration and Metal Technology, and to run various professional short-term training classes for transferred cadres.

    中央工艺美术学院将成立
    本报讯　一所高等艺术学校——中央工艺美术学院将在北京正式成立。这是我国第一所专门为了培养工艺美术人材而设立的高等工艺美术学校。
    中央工艺美术学院是在中央美术学院工艺美术系的原有基础上建立起来的，由中央手工业管理局、文化部、高等教育部和全国手工业合作总社筹委会共同领导。目前先成立染织工艺、陶瓷工艺、装璜设计三个系，都是五年制，现在已经开始招生。学生将不仅在这里学习一般的美术基础课程，而且要学习工艺美术的专业技术，要求在艺术修养上达到一定的水平，并且要求掌握先进的专业生产和科学知识，因此，这所学校将要拟订新的教学计划、教学大纲，依照计划建立各个专业教研室和实习机构。在今后几年中，这所学校还准备陆续开办室内装饰、金属工艺等系，和开办各种专业的短期调干训练班。
