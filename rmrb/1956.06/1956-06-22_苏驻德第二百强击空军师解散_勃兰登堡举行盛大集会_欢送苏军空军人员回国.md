Xinhua News Agency, Brandenburg, June 20th: A grand rally was held in Brandenburg on June 20th to see off all personnel of the 200th Assault Aviation Division, which was disbanded according to the Soviet Union's decision on arms reduction, as they returned home.

Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, Grechko, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Nuschke, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ebert, and tens of thousands of working people of Brandenburg participated in the farewell rally.

Representatives of the command headquarters of the American, British, and French forces in Germany, as well as representatives of other countries' military missions, were also invited to attend the farewell rally.

Nuschke spoke at the rally. He said that the issue of disarmament has now become the key issue in easing international tensions. The Soviet Union has set an example in the issue of disarmament. This shows that the Soviet Union consistently pursues a peaceful policy. If Western countries' governments adopt such an attitude, the issue of substantial arms reduction and the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Germany in the near future can be satisfactorily resolved.

Nuschke expressed his heartfelt farewell to the Soviet soldiers, the liberators and friends of the German people.

Finally, Colonel Kuznetsov spoke at the meeting on behalf of the returning personnel.

    苏驻德第二百强击空军师解散
    勃兰登堡举行盛大集会
    欢送苏军空军人员回国
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社勃兰登堡二十日讯：六月二十日，勃兰登堡举行盛大集会，欢送根据苏联的裁军决定而解散的第二百强击空军师全体人员回国。
    驻德苏军总司令格列奇科、德意志民主共和国副总理努舍克、德国统一社会党中央政治局委员艾伯特和数以万计的勃兰登堡劳动人民参加了欢送会。
    驻德美、英、法军司令部的代表以及其他国家军事使团的代表也应邀参加了欢送会。
    努舍克在会上讲了话。他说，裁军问题现在变成了缓和国际紧张局势的关键问题。苏联在裁军问题上以身作则。这表明苏联一贯执行和平政策。如果西方国家政府采取这样态度，大量裁减和在最近的将来撤退驻在德国的外国军队的问题就可以圆满解决。
    努舍克向德国人民的解放者和朋友——苏联军人表示惜别。
    最后由库兹涅佐夫上校代表回国人员在大会上讲了话。
