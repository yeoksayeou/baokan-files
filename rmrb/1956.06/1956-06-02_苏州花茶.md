    Suzhou Scented Tea
    Shi Yue'e
    People who enjoy drinking green tea often like to add some fragrant flowers to their tea, making the tea even more refreshing and delicious; or they drink scented tea with a floral aroma. Although you can't see a single flower in the cup of this scented tea, it has a strong and fragrant floral aroma. The suburbs of Suzhou produce various fragrant flowers specifically for making this type of scented tea.
    I visited this scented tea area when the fragrant flowers were just beginning to bloom. In the famous Suzhou scenic area of ​​Tiger Hill, clusters of emerald green branches and leaves contain blooming magnolias and bitter orange blossoms, as well as jasmine flowers about to bud. The entire suburb seemed to have turned into a huge flower garden.
    Early morning is the busiest time for tea pickers. The girls picked fresh and tender fragrant flowers, and gathered them from all directions to the fragrant flower purchasing station. According to a responsible comrade at this station: "After liberation, the state took control of the unified purchase of fragrant flowers and implemented a policy of high quality and good prices. The situation before liberation, where a basket of flowers (one hundred taels) could only be exchanged for one liter of rice, is gone forever. Now, one jin of medium-grade white orchid is worth 1.8 yuan, and jasmine is worth 1.2 yuan. The income of flower farmers has greatly increased, their lives have improved, and their enthusiasm for production has also greatly increased. This year, all the flower farmers in the suburbs of Suzhou have been organized. They have successively established fifty-five cooperatives and twenty-three groups. According to the state plan, this year they can produce 16,200 dan of fragrant flowers, which is double the output of 1950.
    There are several fragrant flower cooperatives in the Tiger Hill area. We went to visit the artificially cultivated flower garden of the Xianghua No. 2 Cooperative nearby and saw Comrade Yang Fuxing, the head of the cooperative. Although Yang Fuxing is very young, he has a wealth of experience in cultivating fragrant flowers. According to him, fragrant flowers are not cold-resistant, so they must be artificially cultivated in jars or pots, and moved into flower boxes around the winter solstice to overwinter, and then moved out of the flower boxes around the Qingming Festival in the second year. Flower trees are planted in jars, and the soil and fertilizer in the jars are limited, so very meticulous techniques are needed to cultivate them.
    As we walked back and forth through the flowers, Comrade Yang Fuxing stopped in front of a magnolia flower. He said: This flower is already more than eighty years old and was planted during my grandfather's time. Magnolia flowers can live a long time if they are cultivated well! This year, due to improved cultivation techniques, the mortality rate of fragrant flowers has been reduced by about half compared to previous years on average. The cooperative has a total of 16,800 trees of magnolia, jasmine, and bitter orange, which can yield at least 1,450 dan of flowers. Fragrant flowers account for more than 90% of the flower farmers' total income.
    In addition to the majority of the supply going to scented tea production, when fragrant flowers are on the market in large quantities, a portion is also supplied to women in nearby areas for appreciation or to wear.
    Flower farmers in the suburbs of Suzhou are improving cultivation techniques to increase the yield per unit area of ​​fragrant flowers and supply the people with more and better fresh and tender fragrant flowers.

    苏州花茶
    史越峨
    爱好喝绿茶的人，常常喜爱在茶里放一些香花，使茶叶更加清香可口；或者饮用带有花香味道的花茶，这种花茶泡在杯子里虽然看不到一朵花，却有一股浓郁的芬芳扑鼻的花香。苏州郊区生产各种香花，就是专门用来制造这种花茶的。
    正在香花初开的时候，我访问了这个花茶区。在全国闻名的苏州名胜——虎丘山区，一丛丛翠绿的枝叶间，有开放的玉兰、玳玳花，有含苞待放的茉莉花。整个郊区好像变成了一个巨大的花圃。
    清晨，是采茶的人们最繁忙的时刻，姑娘们采摘了鲜嫩的香花，从四面八方汇集到香花收购站。据这个站的一位负责同志说：“解放后由于国家掌握统一收购香花，贯彻执行了优质优价政策，解放前的那种一篮花（一百两）换一升米的情况已经一去不复返了。现在一斤中等的白兰花价值一元八角，茉莉花价值一元二角，花农们的收入有很大增加，生活得到了改善，生产积极性也大大提高了。今年苏州郊区的花农已经全部组织起来了，他们前后建立了五十五个合作社和二十三个小组，按国家计划今年可以生产一万六千二百担香花，比1950年增产一倍。
    虎丘山区有好几个香花合作社，我们就近到香花二社去参观他们人工栽培的花圃的时候，看到了社长杨福兴同志。杨福兴虽很年轻，可是栽培香花的经验很丰富。据他说，香花本来不耐寒，因此必须用人工栽培在缸内或盆里，每年冬至前后就搬进花箱过冬，到第二年清明前后才搬出花箱。花树栽在缸里，缸里的泥土、肥料都有一定的限度，所以需要很细致的技术来栽培它。
    我们在花丛中穿来穿去，杨福兴同志在一棵玉兰花前站住了。他说：这棵花已经有八十多年的历史了，还是我祖父时候栽培的。玉兰花只要栽培得好，寿命可长呢！今年由于提高了栽培技术，香花的死亡率比往年平均降低一半左右，全社的玉兰、茉莉、玳玳等三种花共有一万六千八百棵树，起码能收1，450担花、香花几乎占花农们总收入的90％以上。
    除了绝大部分供应花茶生产外，当香花大量上市的时候，也供应一部分给附近地区妇女们欣赏或佩戴。
    苏州郊区的花农们正在改进栽培技术，提高香花的单位面积产量，供应人民更多更好的鲜嫩香花。
