    Chongqing Steel Company Allocates Funds to Increase Cultural and Welfare Facilities

    Chongqing Steel Company recently allocated a large amount of funds to improve the material and cultural life of its employees.

    Among the cultural and welfare facilities that the company decided to increase this year, include the construction of housing, clubs, sports grounds and sanatoriums. The first batch of housing was completed in April. Soon, one thousand employees and their families, and one to two thousand single employees can move into new homes.

    The company's amateur sanatorium was suspended last year due to crowded housing. The trade union is now actively preparing to restore it, setting up two hundred beds to accommodate employees with chronic diseases and weak constitutions for amateur recuperation and treatment. In addition, a tuberculosis sanatorium will also be established.

    The company also recently revised its relief measures, expanding the scope of relief for employees with financial difficulties. The trade union has recruited some family members of employees with particularly difficult family lives to participate in various temporary production activities. These people receive an increase in income of approximately twenty to thirty yuan per month.

    Chongqing Steel Company recently conducted a check on the material and cultural living conditions of its employees. It was found that although many cultural and welfare facilities have been added in recent years, including a residential area with 200,000 square meters of construction alone, these facilities are far from meeting the needs. For example, some employees' housing is still relatively narrow, and several hundred workers still live in rural areas. It is necessary to improve this situation quickly.

    重庆钢铁公司拨款增加文化福利设施
    重庆钢铁公司最近拨出大批资金改善职工的物质和文化生活。
    今年这个公司决定增加的文化福利设施中，包括兴建住宅、俱乐部、运动场和休养所等。第一批住宅已经在四月份完工。不久，就有一千个职工和他们的家属、一千到两千个单身职工可以搬进新居。
    这个公司的业余休养所曾因房屋拥挤在去年停办，现在工会正在积极准备把它恢复，设置二百张病床，吸收有慢性病和体质较弱的职工进行业余休养治疗。另外还要建立一所肺病休养所。
    最近这个公司还修改了救济办法，扩大了对生活有困难的职工的救济范围。工会吸收了一些家庭生活特殊困难的职工家属参加各种临时性生产，这些人员每人每月增加收入约二十元到三十元。
    重庆钢铁公司最近对职工的物质文化生活情况作了一次检查，认为几年来虽然增加了不少文化福利设施，其中单是建筑的住宅面积就有二十万平方公尺，但是这些设施已经远远不能适应需要，例如目前还有一些职工的住宅比较狭窄，有几百户工人还居住在农村，这次都有必要迅速加以改进。
