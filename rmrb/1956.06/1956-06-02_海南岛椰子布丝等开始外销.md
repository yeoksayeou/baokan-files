Hainan Island's coconut fiber and coconut coir have begun to be exported to various Eastern European people's democratic countries.

Coconut fiber and coconut coir are by-products of coconuts. This year, after the state included these products in the foreign trade export list, farmers in various producing areas have been processing coconut cloth into coconut fiber as a household sideline industry, and have signed supply contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. It is estimated that the sale of coconut fiber and coconut coir this year can increase income by more than 280,000 yuan.

    海南岛椰子布丝等开始外销
    海南岛的椰子布丝和椰衣开始出口，远销东欧各人民民主国家。
    椰子布丝和椰衣都是椰子的副产品。今年，国家把这项产品列入对外贸易出口货后，各产区农民都把椰子布加工成为椰子布丝当作家庭副业，并和供销合作社订立供应合同。预计今年卖出的椰子布丝和椰衣，可以增加二十八万多元的收入。
