    I agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," agree with Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," and agree with the "Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives." I suggest that the congress approve this budget and final accounts and adopt the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives.
    Now, I would like to report to the congress on the major work of Anhui Province in the past year. Please give your comments and corrections.
    In the year from the second meeting held in July last year to the first half of this year, that is, from the second half of 1955 to the first half of this year, our country has undergone extremely profound changes in all aspects of the national economy. This situation can be sufficiently demonstrated by the major economic changes in Anhui Province over the past year. Due to the promulgation of the "Resolution on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation" by the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's "Report on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation," the agricultural cooperation movement has developed by leaps and bounds healthily since last autumn. As of May this year, 93% of farmers in our province have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, of which farmers participating in fully socialist agricultural cooperatives account for 77.3% of the total number of farmers. It is expected that the socialist agricultural cooperation will be completed throughout the province this winter and next spring. Under the influence of the rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the cooperation of handicrafts have also set off a high tide. At present, private industry and commerce in the province have basically completed the transformation of all industries into joint state-private ownership and other forms of transformation. 99.1% of private industrial enterprises have implemented joint state-private ownership, and 77% of private commercial enterprises have been incorporated into various forms of transformation; 85.7% of individual handicraftsmen have joined handicraft production cooperatives (groups); the transformation of private and individual transportation industries has also basically completed the tasks of public-private cooperation and cooperativization, respectively. Due to the major victories achieved in agricultural cooperation, handicraft cooperation, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the past rural appearance of the small-peasant economy in the province has been fundamentally changed. After the transformation of private industry and commerce and handicrafts, all industries have shown a new atmosphere, and the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the workers have been unprecedentedly improved. Private industrialists and businessmen have generally improved their understanding of socialist transformation. These have laid a good foundation for further in-depth transformation of private industry and commerce.
    In 1955, agricultural production in our province, along with the high tide of the cooperation movement, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and Chairman Mao, and with the active efforts of the broad masses and cadres at all levels, actively promoted the "Three Reforms" method of increasing agricultural production, avoiding disasters, and ensuring harvests advocated by the Provincial Party Committee, overcame the difficulties caused by the 1954 floods, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total harvest of grain crops reached more than 23,050 million jin, not only overfulfilling the annual plan approved by the central government, but also exceeding the state's stipulated target for grain production in our province by 20.6% for the final year of the first five-year plan two years in advance. Except for oil crops and flue-cured tobacco, which failed to be completed, the annual plans for the rest of the economic crops were overfulfilled (such as cotton, which completed 700,000 dan, exceeding 13.4%). We not only overfulfilled the 1955 plan in most aspects of agricultural production and achieved great results, but also overfulfilled the annual plans approved by the state in various aspects such as industrial production, transportation, commodity circulation, culture, education, and health, and achieved significant growth compared with 1954. In short, the achievements of various movements and tasks in the past year have been great. Of course, some mistakes and shortcomings have also occurred in the work, which we need to pay attention to and overcome in the future.
    This year's spring plowing in our province is generally better than in previous years, and the construction of water conservancy projects and the accumulation and production of fertilizers in the past winter and this spring are also more than in the past. The province's methods of avoiding disasters and ensuring harvests and increasing production and changing planting have been promoted on a larger scale. Although there was a drought last autumn and winter, the area of summer harvest crops was still expanded, and the growth of summer and spring harvest crops this year is also good. However, from June 2 to 11, most areas of our province, in just seven or eight days, in the Bengbu and Fuyang areas, had continuous rainfall of 400 to 463 millimeters. In addition, the rainfall in the upper reaches of the Huai River was also large, and the water势 of the dry river tributaries all surged together. Although there were no dike breaks and disasters, more than 19 million mu of land along the river have formed varying degrees of waterlogging disasters. The loss of the summer harvest will reach more than one billion jin of grain. Here someone will ask, why is it that after several years of Huai River treatment, we are still suffering from such a big flood during the summer harvest season? We believe that within a few days, the average rainfall in the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River was about 400 millimeters. If it were not for the role played by the Huai River treatment project in the past few years, this flood would have been even more unimaginable.
    Because Anhui is hit by disasters every year, it has also explored some experience in the struggle against disasters. The three reform measures of avoiding disasters and ensuring harvests and increasing agricultural production put forward by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee are the summary of these experiences. According to these methods, we took measures such as drought resistance in the face of severe drought last year, expanded the planting area of ​​summer crops by more than 7 million mu, and increased the planting of more than 4 million mu of spring corn this spring. Although we suffered such a large disaster in June, it is expected that the total output of summer harvested grain in the province this year can still be more than the total output of 5.8 billion jin of summer harvest last year. Therefore, as long as we mobilize and work hard to do a good job in the current flood prevention, drainage, rush harvesting, rush planting, disaster avoidance and harvest protection, etc., it is still possible to strive for a bumper autumn harvest. According to the current situation, if there are no new exceptionally large floods in the future, it is not only possible to complete the state's 1956 grain production target of 24.3 billion jin for our province, but also to complete the production task of 27 billion jin determined by our province. Thus, it also brings a reliable guarantee for completing our province's entire national economic plan and national budget for 1956 and completing our province's first five-year plan ahead of schedule.
    Anhui is an agricultural area located in the Jianghuai region. The quality of agricultural production is not only related to the lives of tens of millions of people in the province, but also to the country's entire economic construction. For this reason, the central government has given great support to agricultural production in Anhui in the past. After this flood, the relevant departments of the central government have given a lot of help. On behalf of the people of Anhui, I express my respect to the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government. The meticulous care of the central government for the people of our province will further encourage us to work hard to complete or overfulfill this year's tasks.

### 安徽省一年来的主要工作情况——黄岩代表的发言

    安徽省一年来的主要工作情况
    ——黄岩代表的发言
    我同意李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，同意廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”，同意“高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”，并建议大会批准这个预决算案，通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）。
    现在，我就安徽一年来的主要工作情况，向大会作一汇报，请各位代表指正。
    在1955年下半年到今年上半年的一年时间内，即从去年七月份召开的第二次会议以来，我们国家在国民经济的各个方面，都有了极其深刻的变化。这种形势，从安徽地区一年来的主要经济变化情况来看，亦足以证明。由于中共中央的七届六中全会（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题的决议”和毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告的公布，在去年秋天以后，农业合作化运动得到了飞跃地健康地发展，到今年五月份为止，我省已有93％的农户加入了农业生产合作社，其中参加完全社会主义的农业合作社的农户，已占到总农户的77.3％，预计今冬明春全省即可完成社会主义的农业合作化。在农业合作化运动迅速发展的影响下，资本主义工商业的社会主义改造和手工业的合作化，也掀起了高潮。目前全省的私营工商业已基本上完成了全行业的公私合营和其他各种改造形式，私营工业已有99.1％的户数，实行了公私合营，私营商业已有77％的户数，纳入了各种改造形式；个体手工业已有85.7％的人数参加了手工业生产社（组）；私营及个体交通运输业的改造工作，也分别基本上完成了公私合作和合作化的改造任务。由于农业合作化、手工业合作化和对资本主义工商业社会主义改造所取得的重大胜利，过去全省小农经济的农村面貌已经根本改观，在对私营工商业和手工业改造以后，各行业均呈现出新的气象，职工群众的劳动积极性和创造性空前提高起来，私营工商业者对社会主义改造的认识一般的也都有了提高，这些就为进一步地深入改造私营工商业打下了良好的基础。
    1955年我省的农业生产，伴随着合作化运动的高潮，在党中央、国务院和毛主席的正确领导下，在广大群众和各级干部的积极努力下，积极推行了省委所倡议的农业增产、避灾保收的“三改”办法，克服了1954年水灾所造成的困难，并且获得了空前未有的大丰收。粮食作物的总收获量达到2，305，000余万斤，不但超额完成了中央批准的年度计划，并且提前二年超过了国家规定我省第一个五年计划的最后一年粮食生产指标的20.6％的任务。经济作物除油料、烤烟两项未能完成以外，其余均超额完成了年度计划（如棉花完成70万担，超额13.4％）。我们不仅在农业生产方面绝大部分都超额完成了1955年的计划，取得了很大的成绩，而且工业生产、交通运输、商品流转、文教卫生等各方面，也都超额完成了国家批准的年度计划，并较1954年有了显著的增长。总之，过去的一年，各项运动和各项工作的成绩是很大的。当然，在工作中，也产生了一些错误和缺点，需要我们在今后随时注意加以克服。
    今年我省的春耕工作，一般地都比往年好，去冬今春的兴修水利，积肥造肥也比过去多。本省的避灾保收、增产改种的办法，获得了更大范围的推广。去年秋冬虽然干旱，而仍扩大了夏收作物面积，今春夏收作物的生长情况也是良好的。但自6月2日到11日止，我省大部地区，在短短的七、八天中，在蚌埠、阜阳一带，就连续降雨达400至463公厘，加之淮河上游雨量也大，干河支流的水势都一齐暴涨，虽未溃堤成灾，但沿河地区已有1，900余万亩土地，形成了不同程度的内涝灾害。夏季收成的损失将达十几亿斤粮食。在这里有人会问，治淮几年，在夏收季节为什么还会受到这样大的水灾？我们认为：在几天之内，淮河中、上游平均落雨量在400公厘左右，假若没有几年来治淮工程所起的作用，这次水灾将更是不堪设想。
    由于安徽年年受灾，对灾荒斗争也摸索出了一些经验，安徽省委所提出避灾保收，农业增产的三项改革办法，就是这些经验的总结。根据这些办法，我们去年即在严重干旱情况下，采取抗旱等措施，扩大了夏季作物700余万亩的播种面积，并在今春增种了400多万亩的春玉米，虽六月份受了如此大的灾害，预计今年全省的夏收粮食总产量，仍可比去年夏收58亿斤的总产量多一些。因此，只要我们动员起来，努力做好当前的防汛、排涝、抢收抢种、避灾保收等各项工作，争取秋季作物丰收，也还是可能的。就目前情况估计，如果今后没有新的特大水灾，不仅可以完成国家给予我省1956年243亿斤粮食生产指标，而且还可能完成我省确定的270亿斤的生产任务。从而，也就对完成我省1956年的整个国民经济计划和国家预算以及提前完成我省第一个五年计划带来了可靠的保证。
    安徽是一个地处江淮的农业地区，农业生产的好坏，不仅关系到本省几千万人民的生活，而且关系到国家的整个经济建设。为此，中央在过去对安徽的农业生产已经给了很大的支持，这次水灾发生后，中央有关部门又给了很多帮助。我代表安徽人民，向党中央及中央人民政府，表示敬意。中央给予我省人民这种无微不至的关怀，将更加鼓舞我们为完成或超额完成今年的各项任务而努力。
