I completely agree with and support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I suggest that the Congress approve the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives.

In Hunan Province, the value of agricultural output accounts for a large proportion of the province's national economy. After agricultural cooperativization, the organizational form of agricultural production has undergone fundamental changes. The prospects for agricultural development outlined in the National Agricultural Development Program have greatly encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for production. This requires the state to provide more financial support. I think it is entirely appropriate that the national budget for 1956 has more expenditure on agriculture.

Since last autumn, in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, our province, from top to bottom, from leaders to cadres, has vigorously and deeply carried out the struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking. First, a high tide of socialist revolution was set off in the countryside, greatly advancing the agricultural cooperativization movement. At present, the province has basically completed the cooperativization in its primary form, and the cooperativization in its advanced form can also be basically completed this year. After the farmers were organized, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedented. The amount of farmyard manure and native fertilizer accumulated in the province last winter and this spring increased almost twofold compared with the highest amount of fertilizer accumulated in previous years. The amount of earthwork for building and repairing agricultural water conservancy projects, both large and small, has greatly exceeded that of previous years, improving the drought resistance capacity of farmland. Double-cropping rice has been expanded to more than 13 million mu, an increase of more than one time compared to 5.8 million mu last year, accounting for 28% of the rice field area. Agricultural cooperatives are very enthusiastic about raising pigs, and the number of pigs raised has also greatly increased compared with last year. Along with the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production, Hunan Province has also accelerated its pace and expanded its scale in industrial production, basic construction, culture, education, health, and other undertakings, presenting a completely new look. Socialist transformation of handicrafts and private industry and commerce has also achieved major victories. All of these are the great results of vigorously and deeply opposing right-leaning conservative thinking.

This year is the first year for our province to achieve agricultural cooperativization. Both leaders and the masses lack sufficient ideological preparation and experience in leading cooperative production. In addition, after some people vigorously criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, they did not pay enough attention to proceeding from reality in some work, and did not pay enough attention to placing all work plans on a fully reliable basis. Therefore, some problems still occurred in agricultural production work. In the previous stage of work, the main problem was that the production plan was not practical enough and not comprehensive enough. Attention was paid to increasing grain production, but not enough attention was paid to the production of cash crops and other crops, as well as rural sideline occupations. In some areas, due to the simple emphasis on increasing grain production, the planting area of double-cropping rice was excessively expanded. There were also cases of forced planting in some areas where natural conditions were not suitable for planting double-cropping rice, and many important cash crops such as rapeseed, wheat, and beans, as well as other crops, were squeezed out. Many agricultural cooperatives also neglected to organize members to carry out sideline activities in accordance with local conditions due to the excessive emphasis on the collective labor aspect. Of course, grain is the basis of the entire agricultural production, and the special importance of increasing grain production is beyond doubt. In the whole province, the development of grain production must be regarded as the central link of agricultural production in our province. However, it is not permissible to not pay attention to diversified management in agriculture while emphasizing grain production. In the total agricultural output value of Hunan, crops and sideline occupations other than grain account for 50%. If we do not pay attention to this aspect of production, even if grain output increases, the actual income of farmers will not increase much. At the same time, this will also fail to meet the needs of the market and the farmers themselves for agricultural crops and sideline products other than grain. Moreover, due to the simplification of production projects, it will also make it impossible to arrange and use labor rationally. Some cooperatives may have nothing to do during the slack season, while there may be a shortage of labor during the busy season, especially during the early rice harvesting and late rice transplanting. The promotion of improved varieties has a very important effect on increasing grain production. We once transferred a batch of high-quality early japonica seeds from the Northeast, but promoted them on a large scale without sufficient experimentation in our province, resulting in premature heading and partial losses. The second problem in agricultural production work is that some agricultural cooperatives have excessive production costs and waste. This situation mainly exists in large cooperatives and advanced cooperatives. Some cooperatives do not consider costs, invest too much, and have more non-productive expenses. Individual cooperatives even pay too much attention to ostentation and extravagance, and some cooperatives have too many cadres who are divorced from production and excessive administrative management costs. If this problem is not solved well, it will directly hinder the increase of members' income. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, increasing production, saving expenses, and striving for an increase in income for 90% of the members.

In response to some of the problems mentioned above, we have taken active measures and launched a mass movement throughout the province, mobilizing the masses from top to bottom to calculate production accounts and income accounts, and revise and supplement production plans, trying to find ways to increase the production of cooperatives and the income of members. Therefore, some problems have been quickly resolved, and some problems are being vigorously resolved. In order to ensure the growth of agricultural production and to strive for an increase in income for 90% of the members, we must deeply absorb these lessons in order to improve the management level of cadres and the production enthusiasm of the masses. In all work and agricultural production, we must give full play to the role of positive factors, and at the same time, we must proceed from reality and act according to our ability. We should do as much as possible what is appropriate and can be done, and do not force ourselves to do what is not appropriate or cannot be done. In terms of specific measures, first of all, we must continue to do a good job in the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, with rice as the mainstay, vigorously develop diversified management, and generally mobilize the masses to find production avenues, supplement and revise production plans. According to labor, capital, and technical conditions, and according to the situation of production, supply, and marketing, we should restore and develop the original, customary sideline production of the masses. It is necessary to improve labor utilization, further formulate labor plans, and arrange and use labor rationally. Finally, we must save expenses as much as possible and be careful in production. We believe that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, as long as we can resolutely rely on the masses, further give play to the enthusiasm of the people, mobilize all positive factors, and at the same time adhere to the principle of proceeding from reality, on the basis of successfully completing the agricultural cooperativization in its advanced form throughout the province, we will surely be able to achieve new and greater victories on the agricultural production front in Hunan.

    湖南省的农业合作化运动的情况  
    ——谭余保代表
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”、廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”、彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，并建议大会通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程。
    湖南省的农业产值在全省国民经济中占了很大的比重，农业合作化以后，农业生产的组织形式起了根本的变化，农业发展纲要所提示出来的农业发展的前景，又大大鼓舞了农民的生产积极性，这就需要国家在财政上给予更多的支持。1956年国家预算中在农业方面的支出比较多，我认为是完全恰当的。
    去年入秋以后，根据中共中央七届六中全会决议的精神，在中共中央和国务院的领导下，我省从上到下，从领导到干部，大力地、深入地进行了反对右倾保守思想的斗争，首先在农村中掀起了社会主义革命的高潮，把农业合作化运动大大地向前推进了一步。目前，全省的农业已经基本上完成了初级形式的合作化，高级形式的合作化在今年内也可以基本上完成。农民组织起来以后，生产积极性是空前的，去冬今春全省所积家肥、土肥，比往年积肥最高数差不多增加了两倍。兴建和补修农田水利大小工程的土方数更大大超过了往年，提高了农田的抗旱能力。双季稻扩种到1，300多万亩，比去年580万亩增加1倍多，占稻田面积的28％。农业社养猪的积极性很大，养猪数比去年也大有增加。随着农业合作化的高潮和农业生产的高潮，湖南省在工业生产、基本建设、文化教育和卫生等事业方面，也都加快了速度，扩大了规模，出现了全新的面貌。手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造也取得了重大胜利。所有这些，都是大力地、深入地反对右倾保守思想的巨大成果。
    今年是我省实现农业合作化的第一年，从领导到群众都缺乏足够的思想准备，缺乏领导合作生产的经验；加之有些人在大力批判右倾保守思想之后，在有些工作中没有切实注意一切从实际出发，没有很好地注意把一切工作计划安放在充分可靠的基础上，因此在农业生产的工作中，还是发生过一些问题。在前一段工作中，最主要的问题是生产计划不够切实，不够全面，抓住了粮食增产，但对于经济作物和其他农作物以及农村副业的生产重视不够。部分地区由于单纯强调了粮食增产，过量地扩大了双季稻的种植面积，在有些自然条件不适宜种植双季稻的地方也有勉强种植的情况，而且把油菜、麦子和豆子等重要的经济作物和其他农作物挤掉了不少，许多农业社还由于过分强调了集体劳动的一方面，忽略了组织社员因地制宜地进行副业活动。当然，粮食是整个农业生产的基础，粮食增产的特殊重要性是不容怀疑的。在全省来说，发展粮食生产必须当作我省农业生产的中心环节。但是，在强调粮食生产的同时，如果不重视农业方面的多种经营，则是不允许的。湖南的农业总产值中，除粮食以外的农作物和副业所占比重达50％，如果不重视这方面的生产，单是粮食产量增加了，农民的实际收入增加得还是不会很多的。同时，这样也将不能满足市场和农民本身对粮食以外的农作物和副业产品的需要。而且，由于生产项目单一化，也将不能使劳动力合理安排和使用，有些社可能农闲时有些人没活干，农忙时特别是早稻收割、晚稻插秧时却发生劳力不足的现象。推广良种对粮食增产有极重要的作用，我们曾从东北调运一批优良的早粳种子，但未经在我省充分试验就大量推广，结果过早抽穗，造成了部分损失。在农业生产工作中，其次一个问题，就是有些农业社生产成本过大和存在铺张浪费现象。这样的情况主要存在于大社和高级社里面，有些社不计成本，投资过大，非生产性的开支也比较多，个别的社甚至大讲排场、铺张浪费，还有些社脱产干部过多，行政管理费用过大。这个问题如不很好解决，势将直接妨害社员收入的增加。因此，必须切实执行中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的指示，增加生产，节约开支，争取90％的社员增加收入。
    针对上面提到的工作中存在的一些问题，我们已经采取了积极的措施，在全省范围内开展了一个群众性的运动，从上到下发动群众算生产账和收入账，修订和补充生产计划，想办法增加社的生产和社员的收入。因此，有些问题已经迅速解决，有些问题正在大力解决。为了保证农业生产的增长，为了争取90％的社员增加收入，我们必须深刻地吸取这些教训，以此来提高干部的经营管理水平和群众的生产积极性，在各项工作和农业生产中，务必充分发挥积极因素的作用，同时做到因地制宜，量力而行；适宜办的、能办到的尽量去办，不适宜办的、不能办到的就不要勉强去办。在具体措施方面，首先，要继续搞好以稻谷为主的农、林、牧、副、渔各业的生产，大力开展多种经营，普遍发动群众找生产门路，补充和修订生产计划。根据劳力、资金和技术条件，根据产、供、销情况，把过去群众中原有的、习惯的副业生产分别予以恢复和发展。要提高劳动利用率，进一步制定劳动规划，合理地安排和使用劳动力。最后，要尽量节省开支，在生产上精打细算。我们相信，在中共中央和国务院的领导下，只要我们能坚决依靠群众，进一步发挥人民群众的积极性，动员一切积极因素，同时坚持一切从实际出发的方针，在胜利地完成全省高级形式的农业合作化的基础上，我们一定能够在湖南的农业生产战线上取得新的更大的胜利。
