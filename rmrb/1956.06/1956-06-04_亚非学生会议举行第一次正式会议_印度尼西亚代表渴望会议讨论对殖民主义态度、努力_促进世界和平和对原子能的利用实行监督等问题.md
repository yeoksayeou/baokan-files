Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, June 3rd: The Asian-African Student Conference held a plenary session on the evening of June 2nd. The meeting heard a speech by Emir Salim, deputy chief delegate of Indonesia, on behalf of the Indonesian student delegation.

The meeting was chaired by the International Preparatory Committee, as the presidium of the conference had not yet been elected. Chairman Agustin Aminudin announced that this meeting was the first formal session of the Asian-African Student Conference. He said that the issue of the Indian delegation's credentials had not yet been resolved, but most delegations agreed that the formal meeting should not be delayed any longer.

Salim said at the plenary session that Indonesian students were eager to see the Asian-African Student Conference discuss a number of general issues, such as: 1. The attitude of Asian-African students towards colonialism and the role of students in national construction; 2. Discussions on how Asian-African students can contribute to promoting world peace and easing tensions in Asian-African countries and the world through peaceful means and, as far as possible, in accordance with the principles and efforts made by the United Nations Organization to defend world peace; 3. Supervision of the utilization of atomic energy and all other scientific achievements.

He said, "We also hope that the Asian-African Student Conference will appeal to all mankind to oppose 'racial discrimination and segregation' among all human beings, especially among Asian-African students."

Salim said that the responsibilities of Asian and African students are greater than those of students in Western countries. Their burden is heavier because, in addition to their studies and what they directly need to do as students, they also need to pay attention to their responsibilities to their countries and people.

Salim also reported the main views of Indonesian students on educational and faculty cooperation, the social conditions of students, cultural and journalistic cooperation among students, and recreational cooperation.

He said that Indonesian students are eager to see the Asian-African Student Conference fully support the aspirations of the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" and support all efforts to promote the development of education that fosters respect for the national cultures and languages of all participating countries. Furthermore, the Asian-African Student Conference believes that everyone has the right to obtain knowledge and education that meets their individual desires, abilities, and requirements, without restrictions based on political beliefs, religion, social and economic status, nationality, or ethnicity.

He said that Indonesian students believe that the social status of Asian-African students is far from satisfactory, and that the social problems faced by Asian-African students have many common characteristics because Asian-African countries have experienced the same historical process, namely, that these countries were once colonies and have recently had to face various difficulties caused by the struggle for independence against colonialism and imperialism. One of the difficulties they face in common is poor economic conditions, which also affect the social status of all students.

Based on the above ideas and principles, we believe that it is extremely important for Asian-African students to cooperate in efforts to improve the social conditions of students.

He continued that, in terms of cultural cooperation, Indonesian students would like to draw the attention of the Asian-African Student Conference to the entire principle of cultural cooperation stipulated by the Asian-African Conference last year, which is fully supported by Indonesian students.

Salim said that the above-mentioned views submitted by Indonesian students to the Asian-African Student Conference are the result of discussions by thirty-three different student groups from all over Indonesia at the All-Indonesia Student Conference held recently in Jakarta.

After friendly discussions, Indonesian student groups finally materialized their wishes and submitted the following points to the Asian-African Student Conference:

(1) To agree to and implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung from April 18th to 24th last year; (2) To believe that Asian-African students should engage in sincere cooperation based on the spirit of voluntary mutual understanding, mutual respect, and mutual benefit; (3) This cooperation should avoid discrimination and all manifestations of colonialism, and avoid rejecting various opinions and different attitudes; (4) The result of the above-mentioned cooperation is the common interest of Asia and Africa; (5) The Asian-African Student Conference should become a broad student gathering free from any political ideology.

Salim, on behalf of Indonesian students, suggested establishing an executive body to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Student Conference and to promote cooperation and friendly relations among Asian-African students.

The Asian-African Student Conference continued to receive many congratulatory messages, including those from the Indonesian Teachers Union, the All-Indonesia People's Congress, the Indonesian Plantation Workers Union, and students of Moscow University.

    亚非学生会议举行第一次正式会议
    印度尼西亚代表渴望会议讨论对殖民主义态度、努力
    促进世界和平和对原子能的利用实行监督等问题
    新华社万隆3日电　亚非学生会议全体会议在六月二日晚上举行。会上听取了印度尼西亚副首席代表埃米尔·萨利姆代表印度尼西亚学生代表团所作的发言。
    这次会议是由国际筹备委员会主持的，因为会议主席团还没有选出来。主席阿古斯丁·阿米努丁宣布这次会议是亚非学生会议的第一次正式会议。他说，印度代表团的资格审查问题现在还没有解决，但是大多数代表团都同意正式会议不应该再拖延。
    萨利姆在全体会议上说，印度尼西亚学生渴望看到亚非学生会议能够讨论许多一般性的问题，例如：一、亚非学生对殖民主义的态度，学生在国家建设中的作用；二、讨论亚非学生可以通过和平的方法和尽可能依照联合国组织对保卫世界和平所作出的原则和努力，来对促进世界和平和缓和亚非国家和世界的紧张局势作出贡献的问题；三、对原子能和其他一切科学成果的利用实行监督。
    他说，“我们还希望亚非学生会议能够吁请全人类反对在全人类之间、特别是在亚非学生之间的‘种族歧视和隔离’。”
    萨利姆说，亚洲和非洲的学生的责任比西方国家学生更重大。他们的负担之所以更重，是因为他们除了他们的学习和作为学生直接需要做的事情以外，还需要注意他们对他们的国家和人民的责任。
    萨利姆还报告了印度尼西亚学生对于教育上的和教职员之间的合作、学生的社会状况、学生在文化和新闻方面的合作以及文娱方面的合作这些问题的主要的看法。
    他说，印度尼西亚学生渴望看到亚非学生会议完全支持“世界人权宣言”的愿望和支持将促进尊重所有参加国家的民族文化和民族语言的教育的发展的一切努力，而且亚非学生会议认为，任何人都有权获得符合他个人的愿望、能力和要求的知识和教育，而不加以政治信仰、宗教、社会和经济地位、民族或是种族的限制。
    他说，印度尼西亚学生认为，亚非学生所处的社会地位是远远不能令人满意的，亚非学生所面临的社会问题有许多共同的特点，因为亚非国家经历了同样的历史过程，那就是这些国家过去一度是殖民地，最近还不得不面临由于进行反对殖民主义和帝国主义争取独立的斗争而造成的各种困难。他们共同面临的一个困难是恶劣的经济情况，这也影响了所有学生们的社会地位。
    根据上述思想和原则，我们认为亚非学生在努力改善学生的社会条件方面进行合作是极为重要的。
    他接着说，在文化合作方面，印度尼西亚学生愿意请亚非学生会议注意去年亚非会议所规定的文化合作的整个原则，这些原则得到印度尼西亚学生的完全支持。
    萨利姆说，印度尼西亚学生向亚非学生会议提出的上述看法是印度尼西亚全国三十三个不同的学生团体最近在雅加达举行的全印度尼西亚学生会议上讨论的结果。
    经过了友好的讨论，印度尼西亚各学生团体终于把它们的意愿具体化起来，而向亚非学生会议提出下列各点：
    （一）同意并且执行去年四月十八日到二十四日在万隆举行的亚非会议的决议；（二）认为亚非学生应该在自愿的互相了解、互相尊重和互利精神的基础上进行真诚合作；（三）这种合作应该避免歧视和避免殖民主义的一切表现，并且避免拒绝各种意见和不同的态度；（四）上述合作的结果是亚洲和非洲的共同利益；（五）亚非学生会议成为不受任何政治思想影响的广泛学生集会。
    萨利姆代表印度尼西亚学生建议设立执行机构来执行亚非学生会议的决议和促进亚非学生的合作和友好关系。
    亚非学生会议继续收到了许多贺电，其中包括印度尼西亚教师工会、全印度尼西亚人民代表大会、印度尼西亚种植园工人工会和莫斯科大学生的贺电。
