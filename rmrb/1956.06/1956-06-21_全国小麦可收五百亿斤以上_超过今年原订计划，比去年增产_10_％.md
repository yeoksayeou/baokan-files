Xinhua News Agency, 20th - This year, China's wheat harvest is bountiful. After deducting losses from recent floods in parts of Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi provinces, the total wheat output is still expected to reach over 50 billion jin, an increase of more than 10% compared to 1955, and also exceeding the original production plan for this year.

Currently, new wheat from provinces south of the Yangtze River has already entered the market, and provinces north of the Yangtze River have basically completed the emergency harvesting. Most areas north of the Yellow River have also completed harvesting. This year, Shandong Province's wheat production reached its highest level in history, and Sichuan Province has already fulfilled and exceeded its 1957 total output and yield per unit area targets ahead of schedule. Wheat harvests in Hebei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces are also very good.

Originally, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi provinces also had unprecedentedly good wheat harvests, but due to continuous heavy rains and rainstorms in early June, wheat production in some areas of these four provinces suffered varying degrees of losses. However, the wheat harvest in other areas of these four provinces is still very good.

    全国小麦可收五百亿斤以上
    超过今年原订计划，比去年增产10％
    新华社20日讯　今年我国的小麦获得丰收。除去最近安徽、河南、江苏、陕西等省部分地区遭受水灾损失后，预计小麦总产量还可以达到五百亿斤以上，比1955年增产10％多，同时也可以超过今年原订生产计划。
    现在，长江以南各省的新麦已经上市，长江以北各省也基本抢收完毕，黄河以北各省大部地区已经收完。今年，山东省的小麦产量达到历史上最高水平，四川省小麦产量已经提前和超额完成了1957年总产量指标和单位面积产量指标。河北、江西、贵州、广东、广西等省小麦收成也非常好。
    本来河南、安徽、江苏、陕西四省小麦也是空前丰收的，但是由于六月上旬连续的大雨和暴雨的影响，使这四个省的部分地区小麦产量受到不同程度的损失。但这四个省其他地区的小麦收成还是很好。
