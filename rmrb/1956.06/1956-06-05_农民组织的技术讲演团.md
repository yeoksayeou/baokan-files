    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A traveling agricultural technology lecture team composed of farmers in the Jinan Plain recently disseminated advanced experiences in summer replanting and intercropping to members of over a thousand agricultural production cooperatives.
    Organizing agricultural technology lecture teams to spread advanced experiences is a new measure taken in the Jinan cotton and wheat producing areas of Shanxi Province this year to increase yield per unit area. The twenty-eight farmers participating in the lectures are well-known local labor models, rural activists, and technical experts. Using their own and the cooperatives' practical experience, they introduced eight types of intercropping and replanting cultivation techniques to farmers in various places.
    Many agricultural cooperatives in the Jinan Plain, based on the advanced experiences disseminated this time and local conditions, have redeployed their summer replanting and intercropping work.

    农民组织的技术讲演团
    据新华社讯　巡回在晋南平川的一个由农民组成的农业技术讲演团，最近向一千多个农业生产合作社的社员传播了夏季复播、套种等先进经验。
    组织农业技术讲演团传播先进经验，是山西省晋南棉、麦产区今年提高单位面积产量的一项新措施。参加讲演的二十八个农民是当地著名的劳动模范、农村积极分子和技术能手。他们用社里和自己的实际经验，向各地农民介绍了八种套种、复播的栽培技术。
    晋南平川的许多农业社根据这次传播的先进经验和当地条件，重新部署了夏季复播和套种工作。
