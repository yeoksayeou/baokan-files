Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 19th: The main stream of the Huai River has passed its first flood peak this year. The major flood peak that appeared in Xixian County on the Huai River's main stream ten days ago has gradually subsided due to the planned retention and control of the Huai River harnessing project. This morning, the tail end of the flood peak passed Bengbu and flowed smoothly towards Hongze Lake.
　　Hongze Lake, which began discharging bottom water as early as the 9th, has prepared itself to receive the flood peak.
　　Currently, the water level of the Huai River's main stream has generally fallen, except for a slight rise at Fushan. The water levels of the various tributaries have significantly dropped.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: The Yangtze River's water level is trending towards a steady decline. Today's Yangtze River basin flood season report tells people that the water levels from Lizhuang in Yibin County, Sichuan Province in the upper reaches of the Yangtze to Chenglingji in the middle reaches have generally fallen. Only the Yangtze River water levels from Hankou to Datong have risen slightly.
　　The upper reaches of the Yangtze River experienced the first major flood peak of the year in mid-June. During this period, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was rarely seen as high as it was. Despite the ferocity of the flood, this surge has greatly diminished after being retained by the riverbed over a long distance and naturally regulated by Dongting Lake. When the flood peak passed through Hankou yesterday, the water level only rose by 0.14 meters compared to the previous day. Currently, the water levels in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are relatively stable, with very small increases, about one meter lower than the water level during the same period in 1954.
　　From the 16th, the water level of the Han River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, has fallen across the board. Some hydrological stations have seen a decline of two to three meters in the past four days.

    淮河干流度过首次洪峰
    长江水势趋向稳落
    据新华社蚌埠19日电　淮河干流度过了今年的第一次洪峰。十天前，在淮河干流息县出现的大洪峰，经过治淮工程有计划的拦蓄控制，已经慢慢地减退。今天上午，洪峰尾闾过了蚌埠，平缓地流向洪泽湖。
    早在九日就开始排泄底水的洪泽湖，已经做好了迎接洪峰的准备。
    目前，淮河干流水位除浮山微涨外，已经普遍回落。各支流水位都有显著回落。
    新华社武汉19日电　长江水势趋向稳落。今天的长江流域汛期日报表告诉人们：从长江上游四川省宜宾县李庄到中游城陵矶的水位，普遍退落，只有汉口到大通的长江水位稍涨。
    长江上游曾经在六月中旬出现今年第一次较大的洪峰。在这期间，长江上游水位之高，为历年来所少见。尽管洪流如此凶猛，但是经过河床长距离的蓄纳和洞庭湖的自然调节，这股洪流到达长江中游以后已经大大减退，昨天洪峰通过汉口的时候，水位比前一天只抬高了零点一四公尺。现在，长江中、下游水位比较平稳，上涨幅度很小，比1954年同期水位低一公尺左右。
    从十六日起，长江支流汉水水位全线退落，有的水文站四天来退落了两三公尺。
