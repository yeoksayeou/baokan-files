Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: World-renowned Orthodox Archbishop and Lebanese peace advocate Niphon Saba stated at a grand banquet in Beijing held in his honor today: We must use the sword of peace to sever the imperialists' hands reaching into Arab countries.

He made this statement at a luncheon today hosted by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, who invited him. He said: "I am a Lebanese, and also a member of the world's humanity, therefore I have a responsibility to work for Lebanon, for the Arab countries, and for the peace and happiness of the world."

Niphon Saba led the Lebanese delegation to the Helsinki World Peace Congress last year, where he met Guo Moruo. Today, these two veteran peace fighters met again, embracing and kissing each other with excitement and engaging in warm reminiscences. At this banquet, Niphon Saba also met with members of the Chinese delegation to the Helsinki World Peace Congress who were in Beijing, as well as representatives from the Chinese Orthodox Church, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. Niphon Saba said: When I was in contact with the Chinese delegation in Helsinki last year, I discovered a noble quality in the words and deeds of the Chinese representatives, so I gladly accepted Mr. Guo Moruo's invitation to visit China. He said with a smile, "Muhammad once said: 'To seek knowledge, go to China.' Now I am very honored to come to China." He also said: "Now the hearts of every Lebanese brother and every Arab brother are warmly turned towards their Chinese brothers." He expressed his belief that following Egypt's establishment of diplomatic relations with China, other Arab countries will soon establish diplomatic relations with China as well.

At the beginning of the banquet, Guo Moruo delivered a speech warmly welcoming Archbishop Niphon Saba to visit China, and congratulating the growing friendship between China and Lebanon and Arab countries, and the growing strength of the world peace movement.

Mao Dun, head of the Chinese delegation to the Helsinki World Peace Congress, Da PUsheng, a representative from the Chinese Islamic community, and Liu Enhou, a representative from the Chinese Orthodox community, also delivered speeches warmly welcoming Niphon Saba to visit China.

    郭沫若设宴欢迎尼冯·萨巴大主教
    据新华社12日讯　世界著名的东正教大主教、黎巴嫩和平人士尼冯·萨巴今天在北京一个隆重欢迎他的宴会上说：我们一定要以和平的宝剑砍断帝国主义伸向阿拉伯国家的手。
    他是在今天中午应邀出席中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若为欢迎他而举行的宴会，他说：“我是黎巴嫩人，同时又是世界人类中的一分子，因此我既有责任为黎巴嫩、为阿拉伯国家，又有责任为世界的和平和幸福而努力。”
    尼冯·萨巴去年曾率领黎巴嫩代表团出席赫尔辛基世界和平大会，同郭沫若会见。今天这两位和平老战士又见面了，他们兴奋地在一起拥抱、接吻，和亲切叙旧。在这个宴会上，尼冯·萨巴还会见了曾出席赫尔辛基世界和平大会的中国代表团的在京团员们和中国东正教、基督教、伊斯兰教、佛教界人士。尼冯·萨巴说：去年在赫尔辛基同中国代表团接触的时候，从中国代表们的言行中我发现了一种高贵品质，因此我欣然接受郭沫若先生的邀请，来中国访问。他含笑地说：“穆罕默德曾说过：要学知识到中国去。现在我就很荣幸地来到中国了。”他又说：“现在每一个黎巴嫩兄弟和每一个阿拉伯国家兄弟的心都是热烈地朝向着中国兄弟。”他表示相信继埃及同中国建交后，其他阿拉伯国家也将会不久同中国建交。
    在宴会开始的时候，郭沫若曾致词热烈欢迎尼冯·萨巴大主教来中国访问，并且祝贺中国和黎巴嫩以及和阿拉伯国家间的友谊日益发展，世界和平运动日益壮大。
    出席赫尔辛基世界和平大会中国代表团团长茅盾、中国伊斯兰教界人士达浦生、中国东正教界人士刘恩厚也先后致词热烈欢迎尼冯·萨巴来华访问。
