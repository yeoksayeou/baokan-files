Mr. Chairman, Respected Chinese People's Representatives!

    I am pleased to extend greetings to you on behalf of the Finnish Parliament and thank you for the friendly invitation to the Finnish Parliamentary Delegation to visit here.

    We accepted the invitation with pleasure because experience has taught us that visits of this nature will broaden the horizons of parliamentarians, thereby contributing to international understanding. Our two countries are far apart, and until today, only a few Finns have seen with their own eyes how the Chinese people are building their own country and developing their society.

    For a week, we, the members of the delegation, have had the opportunity to visit and understand the daily lives of the Chinese people in China. Although a week is a short time, we should say that China far exceeds all our imaginations, because its territory is larger than Europe, and its people account for a large part of mankind.

    I am referring not only to the hospitality we have received, but also to the desire for progress that runs through all the activities here. We have seen how the hardworking and patriotic Chinese people are building their own country and how they are striving to better utilize the possibilities provided by modern technology. In your universities, we have seen how enthusiastically young people are studying hard to prepare themselves for serving society. We Finns ourselves are members of a small country, and we feel particularly warm about the great China's willingness to help domestic minorities develop their national cultures.

    The situations and needs of countries are different, so it is difficult for a short-term visitor from afar to talk in detail. Each country should determine the form of society and specific measures based on the historical development of the country and the actual needs of the people. The eyes of a guest can only see the big picture.

    We Finns have already seen these big aspects, that is, here is a diligent and tenacious effort being made on a national basis for construction, and efforts are being made to use all scientific achievements to eliminate unsatisfactory situations in society. These big aspects are also familiar and close to us, and we ourselves are also working hard at home for the development of society according to the real situation.

    Please allow me to sincerely thank you for providing us with the opportunity to visit your interesting country. We would be very pleased if we also had the opportunity to let your representatives see our situation. We believe that only more mutual understanding between the peoples of our two countries can promote the cause of peace, which is of great significance to our two countries and to all mankind.

    更多的相互了解才能促进和平事业
    ——芬兰议会访华代表团团长苏克舍拉宁的演说词主席先生，尊敬的中国人民代表们！
    我愉快地以芬兰议会的名义向你们致意，并感谢你们友好地邀请芬兰议会代表团来此访问。
    我们怀着愉快的心情接受了邀请，因为经验告诉我们，这种性质的访问将会扩大议员们的眼界，从而有助于国际间的相互了解。贵我两国相距很远，直到今天，只有很少的芬兰人亲眼看到过中国人民怎样在建设自己的国家，发展自己的社会。
    一星期以来，我们，代表团的成员，曾经有机会在中国的国土上参观访问和了解中国人民的日常生活。虽然一个星期的时间是短促的，但是我们应当说中国远远地超过了我们一切的想像，因为它的国土比欧洲还大，它的人民占人类的很大部分。
    我所指的不仅是我们所受到的盛意和款待，而且是指着贯串在这里的各种活动中的进步的愿望。我们看到勤劳爱国的中国人民如何进行着自己国家的建设，如何为更好地利用现代技术所提供的可能而努力。在你们的大学里，我们看到了青年们为了准备走上为社会服务的岗位多么热情地在专心学习。我们这些芬兰人自己是一个小国的成员，对于伟大的中国愿意帮助国内少数民族发展它们民族文化的做法，感到特别温暖。
    各国的情况和需要是不相同的，因此一个不远万里而来的短期访客很难谈得细致。每个国家应该根据国家历史的发展情况和人民的实际需要来决定社会的形式和具体措施。客人的眼睛只能看大的方面。
    我们这些芬兰人已经看到了这些大的方面，那就是这里正在全民族的基础上为建设而进行着辛勤顽强的努力，正在为利用一切科学成就来消除社会上不能令人满意的情况而努力。这些大的方面对我们也是熟悉亲切的，我们自己也正在国内根据现实情况为社会的发展而努力。
    请允许我衷心地感谢你们为我们提供了参观访问你们的有趣的国家的机会。如果我们也有机会让你们的代表看看我们的情况，我们将感到莫大的愉快。我们相信只有两国人民间更多的相互了解，才能促进对我们两国和全人类都有重大意义的和平事业。
