Better Leverage the Role of Traditional Chinese Medicine
—— Speech by Delegate Ye Xichun

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, Minister Liao Luyan’s explanation of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives, and the speeches of all the leaders and delegates. They have given me many insights, showing the rapid progress of socialist construction in the motherland and the increasing prosperity and improvement of the material life of the people. Our health and medical workers should actively do a good job in healthcare and strive together to fully realize and complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Traditional Chinese Medicine Work in Zhejiang Province

Now, I would like to introduce the situation of traditional Chinese medicine in our province as follows:

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, especially after the implementation of Chairman Mao's wise instructions on traditional Chinese medicine and through the study of traditional Chinese medicine policy, the organizational leadership of traditional Chinese medicine has been strengthened, which has encouraged the enthusiasm of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners nationwide. It has clarified the service goals of traditional Chinese medicine, broken down conservative ideas, and made public family-inherited secret and effective prescriptions, so that these valuable experiences can be widely used for people's healthcare. In terms of academics, due to the recognition of the needs of the objective situation, they generally took the initiative to improve and actively improve the level of traditional Chinese medicine. Zhejiang Province established the Traditional Chinese Medicine Guangxing Hospital in 1952, which was the first traditional Chinese medicine hospital in East China. In 1954, a Traditional Chinese Medicine Training School was established. This year, Hangzhou City established Traditional Chinese Medicine Training Classes and Schools, and added teacher training classes to train teachers of traditional Chinese medicine. In the winter of 1954, Hangzhou established a Traditional Chinese Medicine Outpatient Department and a Central Outpatient Department. Other cities such as Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have also successively established Traditional Chinese Medicine Outpatient Departments, established Traditional Chinese Medicine Academic Core Groups, and carried out traditional Chinese medicine academic research. General hospitals in the province have also added traditional Chinese medicine departments. Through the above series of measures, the vast number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have improved to a certain extent in their professional skills, scientific knowledge, and ideological awareness. In terms of academic exchanges between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, according to the instructions of the Central Ministry of Health to vigorously carry out the movement of Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine, the Provincial Health Department implemented the spirit of the above instructions, and followed the principle of systematic learning first, comprehensive acceptance, and then sorting out. A Western Medicine Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine Committee has been established, and other cities and counties have established Western Medicine Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine Teaching and Research Groups, which have initially carried out the study of classical traditional Chinese medicine literature, theoretical doctrines, and held symposiums on academic experience exchanges between traditional Chinese and Western medicine several times a month. And learn from advanced Soviet medicine. Through these studies, traditional Chinese medicine has also gained some scientific knowledge. Western medicine also attaches importance to the rich and precious medical heritage of the motherland. For example, traditional Chinese medicine, regardless of the north and south, can treat type B encephalitis; for schistosomiasis, which endangers the health of working people, the Hangzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Outpatient Department used traditional Chinese medicine to treat it, and developed compound insecticidal pills, golden yellow pills, and insecticidal and digestion-promoting decoctions. The curative effect of compound insecticidal treatment of schistosomiasis has reached 53.8%. For those with ascites, the new formula Shi Zao Wan is used. For surgical treatment of skin inflammation and swelling, there is Qingliang ointment. These have been scientifically analyzed and clinically practiced in cooperation with the Provincial Health Experimental Institute and the Third Municipal Hospital, and significant curative effects have been obtained. Our province has strengthened the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, organized traditional Chinese and Western medicine to go to the countryside to go deep into the rural areas, set up mobile treatment stations; used scientific testing, and used traditional Chinese medicine for treatment, so as to achieve both production and treatment, and neither treatment nor production is hindered, which has been welcomed by the majority of farmers. Although the above work has achieved some results, it is still lagging behind the masses when measuring our work situation under the current socialist development. For example, Western medicine's learning of traditional Chinese medicine has not been fully launched, and private practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have not been actively organized to jointly embark on their jobs, and there is a lack of specific leadership in the management of traditional Chinese medicine, which seriously hinders the exertion of the potential power of traditional Chinese medicine. These shortcomings are mainly due to our insufficient understanding of the guidelines and policies, our insufficient socialist awareness, and our very weak mass viewpoint. There is a serious right-leaning conservative ideology, which must be vigorously criticized and thoroughly corrected. For the needs of the country and the people, to closely cooperate with the development of industrial construction and agricultural cooperation, we must better exert the power of traditional Chinese medicine and serve the people. Now, I would like to put forward the following suggestions: Develop joint medical institutions to serve agricultural production

1.  Continue to develop joint medical institutions and strengthen leadership. Because joint institutions are cooperative in nature, they are social health and welfare undertakings, and they are also a powerful assistant to the national medical institutions. At present, the main tasks of the health and medical teams serving agricultural cooperatives are: cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, reasonable arrangement, carrying forward the spirit of mutual assistance, focusing on the actual needs of rural areas, focusing on the development of rural joint clinics, focusing on rural production services, and gradually establishing prevention and health stations, nurseries, midwives, etc., and consolidating them according to the actual situation. Strengthen the management of Chinese herbal medicine - encourage farmers to grow and collect medicine
2.  Because we see the annual shortage of medicine, we should strengthen the management of Chinese herbal medicine. In the past few years, the management of Chinese herbal medicine has lacked unified leadership and has not been included in the planned track, which has resulted in frequent disconnection between production, supply, and marketing. Among them, there are many export medicinal materials, such as Atractylodes macrocephala, Paeonia lactiflora, Corydalis yanhusuo, Polygala tenuifolia, Fritillaria thunbergii, Schizonepeta tenuifolia, etc., which have not been planned to increase production. Now our province statistics that there are more than 120 kinds of goods out of stock, and other provinces are also the same. Zhejiang Province is also a place of medicine production. There are more than 80 kinds of artificial planting, and more than 200 kinds of wild medicines in high mountains, wasteland, fields, and embankments. The reason for the lack of household-grown medicines is that the interest of growing medicines is not as much, as fast, and as much as growing miscellaneous grains. Growing medicines often takes a year and a half, and some take two or three years to mature. Therefore, medicine farmers feel that growing medicines is not as profitable as growing food crops. Wild medicines are affected by the forest closures on the mountains, which make it difficult to enter the mountains to collect medicines. Those produced in wasteland are gradually eliminated because the wasteland has been transformed into cultivated land due to the strengthening of universal labor production. There are also more than 30 kinds produced on the embankments, such as the most needed Pulsatilla chinensis, Taraxacum mongolicum, Viola yedoensis, Isatis tinctoria, Arctium lappa, Leonurus japonicus, Cassia obtusifolia, Celosia argentea, Allium chinense, and Eupatorium fortunei, etc. After agricultural cooperation, they became collective farms. Therefore, the embankments have been reduced, and the source of wild medicines has also been reduced. Foreign medicines, such as frankincense, myrrh, Amomum villosum, Aucklandia lappa (Aucklandia lappa is actually produced in East India, not Guangdong); precious medicines such as Xi Niuhuang, the output decreased year by year, and musk produced in western Sichuan, Changdu and Kang Tibet has decreased sharply in the past two years. These two are extremely needed in the storage of Chinese medicines. For example, more than a dozen internal medicines such as Niuhuang Zhibao Pill, Zixue Pill, Qingxin Pill, and Liushen Pill for the treatment of type B encephalitis, typhoid fever, and febrile diseases contain Xi Huang musk because they function to enter the brain, clear the heart, and reduce fever. Those used in pediatrics include Niuhuang Baolong Pill, Amber Baolong Pill, Children's Rejuvenation Pill, Yili Pill, and Niuhuang Zhenjing Pill, etc.; those used in traditional Chinese medicine surgery include Plum Blossom Dian She Pill, Shen Sai Pill, Chan Su Pill, Lima Hui Ding Pill, and Xiao Jin Dan, etc. A total of more than 30 kinds of medicines require Xi Huang and musk. People only know that it doesn’t matter if it’s temporarily out of stock, but they don’t know that household planting and wild production are cut off from seeds from less to more. It’s not an exaggeration, and there are examples to draw on. For example, wild Hubei Atractylodes (also known as Hubei Zi) produced in Hubei has been cut off for more than 30 years from 1915 to today; Jiangxi Atractylodes (also known as Jiangxi Zi) produced in Jiangxi has also been cut off for 20 years. For example, Xianju Atractylodes produced in Xianju County, Zhejiang Province, and Atractylodes produced in Yuqian County have also been cut off for five years. The Ben Cao (Materia Medica) records that Atractylodes produced in Yuqian is the best, which is a famous product of Zhejiang. All kinds of Atractylodes treat gastrointestinal diseases, treat senile spleen deficiency, chronic dysentery, and are important medicines for invigorating the middle and replenishing Qi. In 1954, the Central Health Bureau instructed Yuqian County that the famous products must not be cut off, and should be replanted as soon as possible. Who knows that the original seeds of Yu Atractylodes have been cut off, and the seeds of Dong Atractylodes are used for production, and its properties, taste, and efficacy are very different from the original Yu Atractylodes. In addition, some medicinal materials are abundant in the place of origin, but they are unwilling to supply other provinces. For example, Henan Huaiqing's Rehmannia glutinosa has more than 1,000 dan in stock, and Zhejiang sent people to buy dozens of dan in cash with supporting documents, but they were unwilling to sell it; another example is that the necessary medicine for treating schistosomiasis, Leiwan, is in stock in the north and out of stock in the south. Such situations vary. Judging from the current situation of medicine shortage, it seriously affects the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine and hinders the health of the people. In order to solve the shortage of Chinese medicine and the supply of goods, we should first strengthen the leadership of Chinese medicine companies and cooperatives in various provinces and cities, quickly investigate the reasons for the shortage of goods on the market, reasonably adjust the purchase price of goods, and send personnel to the countryside to purchase in a timely manner. If they are collected, they should be exposed to the sun and baked as soon as possible to prevent mold, insects, and moths, which will damage the state's funds. Secondly, in the National Agricultural Development Program, it is stipulated that farmers should be encouraged to grow medicines as a sideline to obtain considerable income. Regarding mountain medicine collection, the local health bureau, offices, and sections should contact the agricultural and forestry management bureau. Medicine farmers should be allowed to enter the mountains to collect medicines, but they must not damage trees and seedlings, and must not bring flammable materials. The number of people and the date must be limited, and they must enter the mountains with supporting documents. If this can be done, wild medicines can be supplied to the market, and at the same time, the livelihood of medicine farmers can be relieved. The above is a general view, not specific enough, please criticize and supplement as much as possible, this is my sincere prayer.

    更好地发挥中医中药的作用
    ——叶熙春代表的发言
    我完全同意和衷心拥护李先念副总理所作1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长所作的高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明，并各位首长与各代表的发言，使我获得了许多认识，显示了祖国社会主义建设的突飞猛进和全国人民物质生活日益宽裕和提高。我们卫生医务工作人员，应该积极做好保健工作，为彻底实现和提前完成第一个五年计划而共同努力。
    浙江省的中医中药工作
    现在就我省中医中药工作情况作如下的介绍：
    解放以来，在党和政府正确领导下特别是贯彻了贤明的毛主席对中医中药工作的指示，以及通过中医政策学习以后，加强了对中医的组织领导，鼓舞了全国中医的积极性，使中医明确了服务目标，打破了保守思想，公开了家传秘方与验方，将这些宝贵经验广泛地为人民保健而服务。在学术方面，由于认识到客观形势的需要，一般都主动地要求进步，积极提高中医学术水平。浙江省在1952年成立了中医广兴医院，这是华东五省第一个中医院。在1954年成立了中医进修学校，在本年度，杭州市成立了中医进修班、校，增设了师资进修班，培养中医师资人才。1954年冬，杭州成立了中医门诊部、中心门诊部。其他宁波、温州、金华、绍兴、嘉兴、湖州等七市，也陆续成立中医门诊部，成立了中医学术核心小组，开展中医学术研究工作。本省综合性医院，也加添了中医科。通过以上一系列的措施，使广大的中医界在业务技术、科学知识和思想觉悟上，都有了一定的提高。在中西医学术交流方面，根据中央卫生部大力开展西医学习中医运动的指示，省卫生厅贯彻上项指示的精神，遵照先系统学习，全面接受，加以整理的方针，已成立了西医学习中医委员会，其他市、县成立了西医学习中医教研小组，均初步开展学习中医经典文献、理论学说，并举行中西医交流学术经验座谈会，一月数次。并学习苏联先进医学，通过这些学习，中医亦得到了一些科学知识。西医方面亦重视了祖国丰富和宝贵的医学遗产。例如中医不分南北，多能治疗乙型脑炎；对危害劳动人民健康的血吸虫病，杭州市中医门诊部用中药治疗，研究出了复方杀虫丸、金黄丸、杀虫消积汤，复方杀虫治疗血吸虫病的疗效已达到53.8％。有腹水者用新方十枣丸。外科治皮肤发炎肿烂等症，有清凉膏，均与省卫生实验院、市第三医院，在中西医合作下，通过科学分析、临床实践，获得显著的疗效。本省加强了血吸虫病防治工作，组织中西医下乡深入农村，设巡回治疗站；用科学检验，用中药治疗，做到边生产、边治疗，治疗生产两不妨，获得多数农民的欢迎。以上工作虽得了一些成就，但在目前社会主义形势发展下来衡量我们的工作情况，还是落在群众之后。如西医学习中医，未能全面展开，对私人开业中医未能帮助积极组织其共同走上工作岗位，对中药管理缺乏具体领导，严重地阻碍了中医潜在力量的发挥。这些缺点主要是我们对方针政策领会得不够，社会主义觉悟还不够高，群众观点甚为薄弱，存在着严重的右倾保守思想，必须经过大力批判和彻底纠正而后方可。为了国家和人民的需要，密切配合工业建设和农业合作化运动的发展，必须更好的发挥中医中药的力量，为人民服务。现提出如下几点意见：发展联合医疗机构为农业生产服务
    一、继续发展联合医疗机构，并加强领导。因联合机构是合作社性质的，是社会卫生福利事业，亦是国家医疗机构的有力助手。在目前为农业合作社服务的卫生医疗组的主要任务：中西医合作，合理安排，发扬互助精神，根据农村实际需要，重点发展农村联合诊所，围绕农村生产服务，逐步的设立防治保健站、托儿所、助产士等等，按照实际情况，整顿而使巩固。加强中药管理——鼓励农民种药采药
    二、因为看到每年药荒，应当加强中药管理。几年来对中药管理工作，缺乏统一领导，没有纳入计划轨道，因而造成了产、供、销经常脱节，其中有很多外销药材，如白术、白芍、玄胡索、远志、象贝、荆芥等等，均未计划增量生产。现在我省统计断货缺货已有一百二十余种，他省亦复如此。浙江全省亦是产药之处，人工种植的八十余种，高山、荒地、田塍、野生药物占有二百多种。家种药的缺少原因：种药的出息不及种杂粮又多又快，种药往往经过一年半载，有的要两年三年，方能成熟，因此，药农感到种药还不如种粮食作物收益多。野出的药材，受到山上的育林封禁的影响而使入山采药困难。出于荒地的，因普遍的劳动生产加强，把荒地变成熟地，野生药逐渐消灭，在田塍上产生的亦有三十余种，如最需用的白头翁、蒲公英、紫地丁、板蓝根、牛蒡子、茺蔚子、决明子、青箱子、薤白、佩兰等，在农业合作化后成了集体农场。因此减少了田塍，同时亦减少野生药的出处。外来的药品，如乳香、没药、砂壳、广木香等（广木香实出在东印度，并非广东所产）；贵重药品如西牛黄，产量年减，打箭炉之西、昌都康藏等处所出的麝香，去今两年锐减，此两种在中药的存药上，极端需要，如治乙型脑炎、伤寒、瘟热等症的十余种内科用药牛黄至宝丹、紫雪丹、清心丸、六神丸等多含有西黄麝香，因功能入脑清心退热。小儿科用者，牛黄抱龙丸、琥珀抱龙丸、小儿回春丹、一厘丹、牛黄镇惊锭等；在中医外科上用者，如梅花点舌丹、神塞丸、蟾酥丸、立马回疔丹、小金丹等类，共计存药所需用西黄、麝香者计三十余种。人只知暂时断挡何妨，而不知家种与野出，由少而断绝了种子。不是我过甚其词，亦有例可援。如湖广所出野生湖广术（亦名湖广子），从1915年至今，断绝了三十余年；江西所产的江西术（亦名江西子）亦断了二十年出产。似浙江本省仙居县所产仙居术，于潜县产于术，亦断了五年。本草上所载，术产于潜者最良，是浙江著名的名产品。凡术类皆治肠胃病，治老年脾虚、久痢、补中益气之要药，在1954年中卫生局曾嘱于潜县名产品不可使其断绝，速即补种，那知于术原种子已断绝，改用冬术种子出产后其性与味及效用与原来的于术大大不同。另外，有些药材在原产地很多，但又不肯供应外省。如河南怀庆的生地黄存货一千余担，浙江派人用证明文件以现款购货数十担，而不肯出售；又如治血吸虫必要药雷丸，北方有货，南方缺货。诸如此类情况不一，照此目前药荒情况来看，严重地影响了中医疗效，妨碍了人民的健康。为了解决中药药荒与货源供应，首先应该加强对中药公司和各省、市合作社的领导，迅速调查市上缺货原因，合理调整收货价格，及时派员下乡收购，收来了急须应晒应焙，勿使霉烂虫蛀，损耗了国家资金。其次在全国农业发展纲要中，规定要劝导农民把种药作为副业，以得到相当的收入、关于山区采药，当地卫生局、所、科联系农林管理局。应准许药农入山采药，但不得损害树木幼苗，不得随带引火之物，并限人数、限日期、凭证明文件入山。若能如此而行，俾野出药材得以应市，同时救济了药农生计。以上一管之见，不够具体，务请大家尽量批评，加以补充，是所切祷。
