Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 3rd. The CCP Lüda Municipal Committee convened a meeting of branch secretaries from economic departments on May 31st and June 1st to exchange experiences in leading the development of the advanced producer movement.

    The CCP Dalian Shipbuilding Company Machinery Plant Branch introduced its experience in how the Party branch leads employees in formulating individual progress plans; the CCP Dalian Crane Factory Iron Casting Workshop Branch introduced its experience in regularly focusing on the political and ideological work of employees. These experiences all illustrate that as long as the branch work overcomes right-leaning conservative thinking, actively supports the advanced, enthusiastically helps the backward, and constantly cares about the production and living conditions of the masses in the advanced producer movement, the movement can continue to develop. The CCP Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory Boiler Workshop Branch, due to its attention to supporting the advanced in the movement, has continuously expanded the ranks of advanced producers. The team of advanced workers in the entire workshop has expanded from the original 86 to 148.

    The meeting believed that Party organizations, especially Party branches, bear a very important responsibility in the advanced producer movement. Therefore, it is required to change leadership styles and working methods to strengthen the leading role of the branches. First, it is necessary to comprehensively care for the masses, so that the connection between the Party and the masses is further strengthened. It is not only necessary to care for and help workers progress, but also to help engineering and technical personnel and staff progress politically and technically. Second, it is necessary to specifically analyze the actual work situation, address key issues in production, and promote advanced experiences, avoiding generalized appeals. Third, Party organizations should pay attention to comprehensively implementing the policy of completing national plans in greater, faster, better, and more economical ways in the advanced producer movement, and should pay attention to fully mobilizing the masses in the movement to ensure the comprehensive and healthy development of the advanced producer movement.

    中共旅大市委召开经济部门支部书记会议
    交流领导先进生产者运动的经验
    新华社旅大3日电　中共旅大市委员会在五月三十一日和六月一日召开了经济部门支部书记会议，交流了领导开展先进生产者运动的经验。
    中共大连造船公司机械厂支部，在会上介绍了党支部怎样领导职工制定个人进步计划的经验；中共大连起重机器厂铸铁车间支部介绍了怎样经常注意做好职工的政治思想工作的经验。这些经验都说明了支部工作在先进生产者运动中只要克服了右倾保守思想，积极支持先进的，热诚帮助落后的，经常关心群众的生产情况和生活情况，就能使运动不断发展。中共大连机车车辆制造工厂锅炉车间支部由于在运动中注意了支持先进，使先进生产者队伍不断扩大。全车间的先进工人队伍已经由原来的八十六名扩大到148名。
    会议认为，在先进生产者运动中，党组织特别是党的支部负有很重要的责任。因此要求改变领导作风和工作方法，加强支部的领导作用。首先要全面地关怀群众，使党和群众的联系进一步加强。不仅要关心和帮助工人的进步，而且还要帮助工程技术人员和职员在政治上和技术上进步。其次，要具体分析实际工作情况，对生产中的关键问题和推广先进经验等问题，避免一般化的号召。再次，党组织在先进生产者运动中要注意全面贯彻又多、又快、又好、又省地完成国家计划的方针，并且要注意在运动中全面发动群众，保证先进生产者运动全面健康地发展。
