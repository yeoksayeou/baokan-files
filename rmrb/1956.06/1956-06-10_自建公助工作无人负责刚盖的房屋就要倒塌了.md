    Self-Built Publicly-Assisted Housing Unattended, Newly Built Houses About to Collapse
    To the Editor:
    Last year, the Baichengzi Branch of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau and the Baichengzi District Trade Union of the Chinese Railway Trade Union built a batch of self-built, publicly-assisted employee housing in the Zhengjiatun area. Because these two units were irresponsible in this work, and the construction department only cared about rushing to complete the task and ignored quality, this batch of houses was not only expensive to build, but also had the danger of collapsing as soon as they were built.
    These houses were one and a half rooms per household, with a wall in the middle. The walls of the houses were made of mud bricks. The construction took place in winter, and the walls froze as soon as they were stacked. The houses had no foundations or plinth stones, and some even lacked center beams. How much did such a one-and-a-half-room adobe house cost? About 260 yuan. Therefore, the employees felt it was not worth it at all, but since it had already been built, they had no choice but to accept it as a burden.
    Before the residents had even moved in, the walls of some houses had already collapsed, so they had to be rebuilt. Because there were no plinth stones, the walls of some houses had already sunk; because there were no center beams, the places where the purlins connected in some houses had already collapsed... Currently, about 60% of the houses have problems. If you walk into this residential area, you can see the residents in various states of distress: some are using railway sleepers to support the roof; some are using pillars to prop up the walls. Some residents have several railway sleepers propping up their room, making it inconvenient to sit or lie down.
    Now that the rainy season is approaching, these houses are in danger of collapsing if they are not repaired quickly. The two units responsible for leading the self-built, publicly-assisted work can no longer close their eyes and ignore this matter.

### 自建公助工作无人负责刚盖的房屋就要倒塌了

    自建公助工作无人负责刚盖的房屋就要倒塌了编辑同志：
    去年，锦州铁路管理局白城子分局和中国铁路工会白城子分区工会在郑家屯地区修建了一批自建公助的职工住宅。由于这两个单位对这项工作不负责任，施工部门又是只顾赶任务而不顾质量，因此这批房子不但造价高，而且刚修起就有倒塌的危险。
    这批房子是每户一间半，中间隔一道墙。房子的墙壁是用泥垛的，施工的时候正是冬季，墙刚刚垛起来就冻住了。房子没有地基，也没有柱角石，有的甚至连中间梁都没有。这样一间半小土房造价是多少呢？二百六十元左右。因此，职工们都感到太不合算，但是既然已经盖起来了，不要也没法处置，只好把它当作一个包袱背起来。
    住房的人还没有搬进去，有的房子墙已经倒了，于是不得不重修。因为没有柱角石，有的房子墙已经下沉；因为没有中间大梁，有些房子檩子之间衔接的地方已经塌下来了，……现在出毛病的房子已经有60％左右。如果走进这个住宅区，就可以看到住户们的各种狼狈相：有用枕木撑房顶的；有用柱子顶墙的。有些住户的一间房子里就撑着好几根枕木，坐卧都不方便。
    现在雨季就要来了，这些房子如果不快整修，就有倒塌的危险。负责领导自建公助工作的这两个单位不能再闭起眼睛不管这件事了。
