    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report. Hearing about the further development and continuous growth of our country's national economy in 1955 in the budget report made me very excited. I believe that the proportional allocation of investment in heavy and light industry, and industry and agriculture, in the 1956 budget is entirely appropriate.
    I would like to express some opinions on the issues of industrial materials and workers' wages and housing. Of course, these issues have already been mentioned in the reports and important speeches of the central responsible comrades, and even some resolutions have been made to solve them. I believe that as a delegate from the masses, it is still necessary for me to put forward some suggestions for reference.
    In the past few years, the workers of Hunan, like all the workers across the country, have made great contributions to the socialist industrialization of our motherland under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Since last year's high tide of agricultural cooperativization and the high tide of industrial construction, the workers of our entire province have actively engaged in the advanced producer movement, and a large number of new people and new things have emerged. However, a common problem in the current production is the shortage of raw material supply, especially the lack of steel plates and steel. This has caused some factories to suffer from serious material shortages, and some factories and mines even failed to complete their plans on time and improve the quality of their products due to the lack of materials. In the Hunan factory where I work, the material shortage has been serious since the first quarter of this year. Sometimes, when the goods should be delivered, where are the materials? No one knows where they come from. Some workers even couldn't start work for several days because they didn't have materials. Sometimes the factory sent people to various parts of the country to borrow materials. After finally getting the materials, the plan was about to be overdue. What to do? In order to save time, we had to rush. Therefore, the cadres above and the auxiliary workers below rushed to catch up with the tasks, working overtime day and night. In March of this year, a comrade named Zhou Jianxun in our factory didn't sleep for two days and one night. In May, Chen Tianran worked for 27 hours without leaving the construction site. The consequences of material shortage are poor quality, overworked workers, and frequent safety accidents, which also affect the health of the workers. I think this kind of problem is not an isolated case, but a common one. Of course, there are other factors that contribute to the poor quality and overtime work, but the lack of materials is a major reason. Vice Premier Li Xiannian mentioned in his report that the output of several important products, including steel and steel, did not meet the plan from January to May this year. He also mentioned that the plans of some capital construction units were not completed in the past five months, mainly due to the insufficient supply of building materials such as steel, cement, and machinery and equipment. Therefore, we workers who are suffering from work stoppages and material shortages, in addition to trying our best to save the use of raw materials and improve the quality of products, hope that the relevant government departments will take various effective measures to solve this problem. It is precisely for this reason that we fully support the proportional distribution of economic construction expenditures stipulated in the 1956 national budget.
    In the past few years, our country has attached great importance to the wages and welfare of workers. Workers' wages have been continuously increased, and their living standards have also been improved, which has played a positive role in encouraging employees to improve their professional and technical skills, increase labor productivity and work efficiency, and promote the recovery and development of the national economy. However, if we compare the growth rate of labor productivity with the growth rate of workers' wages, they are not commensurate. The lives of low-level workers, especially auxiliary workers, in enterprises are still very difficult. A technician named Zhao Zhengfu in our factory has a family of seven, and his wages are the only source of income. Since 1952, his wage has been level 3, and it is still level 3, with an average of less than 6 yuan per person. Although this is not a large amount, their lives are difficult. Of course, the leadership has provided some subsidies, but this still cannot fundamentally solve their problems. Now the old and unreasonable system has been abolished, and the new system has not kept up. Although many reward systems have been established, this reward system can only encourage some people and cannot solve the problem of the difficult lives of all workers. Since the high tide of agricultural cooperativization last year, some individual workers have seen that some cooperatives have a daily labor remuneration of 1.5 yuan, so they are not at ease and envy the farmer brothers. This situation is of course wrong, and it also fully reflects the unreasonable wages. Recently, government agencies have conducted detailed research and solutions to the issue of wages and benefits, and I think this is entirely correct. This will further stimulate the enthusiasm of the workers.
    With the development of national construction, the number of employees has increased a lot, and the housing and non-productive buildings for employees have also increased accordingly. However, the housing for employees is still a major issue and should be resolved as soon as possible. For example, some factories are not in the city, so employees cannot even rent private houses. Some workers even found that the houses are not suitable at all and are very small. The same is true in our factory. A worker surnamed Liu once told me that his father, son, and grandson live in one room for three generations. Some workers have been in the factory for many years, and the housing problem has not been properly resolved. Their emotions are very unstable. Their hearts are at home even when they are in the factory. I think that caring for the lives and welfare of employees and the broad masses of working people is the fundamental policy of our country. Only in this way can we combine the improvement of individual life with the interests of the collective and the country, so as to greatly enhance the production enthusiasm of all working people and ensure the victorious advance of the socialist construction cause.

    改善材料供应工作和职工生活
    ——言仁海代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明，以及彭真副委员长的工作报告。在预算报告中听到了1955年我们国家的国民经济有了进一步的发展，有了不断的增长。这使我感到非常的兴奋，在1956年的预算中，对于重工业和轻工业、工业和农业的投资比例的安排，我认为是完全恰当的。
    我想就关于工业材料和职工工资住宅问题发表一些意见。当然这些问题在中央负责同志的报告和重要发言中已经提到了，甚至有些还已经作出解决的决议，我认为作为我一个群众中来的代表，还有提出一些参考意见的必要。
    几年来，我们湖南的工人和全国所有的工人同志一样，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下为我们祖国社会主义工业化，也作出了很大的贡献。自去年农业合作化的高潮与工业建设的高潮以来，我们全省的工人同志都积极的投入了先进生产者运动的浪潮中，涌现了大批的新人新事，但是，在当前的生产中普遍存在的一个问题，就是原材料供应不上，特别是钢板和钢材缺乏，以致使有的工厂引起了严重的待料情况，有些厂矿甚至因为没有材料，造成计划不能按时完成，质量提不高的恶果。在我所工作的湖南一个工厂内，今年第一季以来，待料情况严重，有时应该交货了，但是材料呢？还不晓得来自那里。有的工人甚至因为没有料子，连续几天不能开工，有时厂里派人到全国各地去拨借，好容易等到材料搞来了，可是计划又快脱期了。怎么办呢？为了争取时间只有赶吧。于是上面的干部，下面的辅助工都轰起来赶任务，日日夜夜加班加点。今年三月我厂有一个周建勋同志两天一晚没有沾枕头。五月间有一个陈天然整整工作27小时未离工地。这样由于材料缺乏带来的后果是质量不高，工人疲劳过度，安全事故百出，也就影响了工人身体的健康。我看这样的问题不是个别单位的问题，而是带有普遍性的问题。当然，质量不高，加班加点，还有其他的因素存在，但材料缺乏却是一个主要原因。李先念副总理在报告中提到，今年1至5月份有几项重要的产品的产量没有完成计划，其中包括钢和钢材在内。同时也提到有些基本建设单位的计划在过去5个月没有完成，主要是由于钢材、水泥等建筑材料和机器设备的供应不足，因此我们一些受到停工待料之苦的工人们，除了自己尽量节约原材料的使用和提高产品的质量以外，希望政府有关部门采取各项有效措施，解决这个问题。正是因为这个缘故，我们对于1956年国家预算规定经济建设支出的分配比例表示完全拥护。
    几年来，我们国家对于工人的工资福利事业是非常重视的，工人的工资得到了不断的增多，生活也得到了改善，这对鼓励职工提高业务技术水平、提高劳动生产率和工作效率，促进国民经济的恢复和发展，起了积极作用。但是如果拿劳动生产率增长的速度和工人的工资提高的速度相比，那是不相适应的。在企业中低级的工人特别是辅助工人，他们的生活仍然是很困难的，我厂有一个技工赵正富同志，他家7口人，全靠他工资收入，从1952年起，他工资是3级，现在仍旧是3级，平均每人分不到6块钱。这虽然为数不多，但他们的生活是困难的。当然领导上作了一些的补助，但还是不能从根本上解决他们的问题。现在旧的不合理的制度已经取消，新的制度没有跟上来，虽然，建立了很多的奖励制度，但这种奖励制度，只可能鼓励部分人，不可能解决全部工人生活困难问题。自去年农业合作化的高潮以来，有个别的工人，看见有些社每个劳动日报酬达到1元5角，于是就不安心，羡慕农民兄弟。这种情况当然是不对的，这也完全反映了工资不合理的情况。最近政府机关对工资福利问题作了详细的研究和解决，我认为这完全是正确的，这样才能更加刺激工人的积极性。
    随着国家建设的发展，职工人员增加了很多，职工的住宅和非生产性的建筑跟着也增加了，但是职工的住宅仍然是一个重大问题，应该想办法快点解决，例如有的工厂不在城市里，所以职工连民房也佃不到，有的工人甚至找到了房子实在太不适用，非常的狭小，在我们工厂也是这样的情况，有一个姓刘的工人有一次告诉我，他说我老子、儿子、孙子一家三代住在一间房，有的工人进厂年数很久，房子问题没有适当解决，情绪很不安定，人在工厂心在家里。我想关心职工和广大劳动人民的生活福利，是我们国家的根本政策，因为只有这样把个人生活的提高和集体的国家的利益结合起来，才能大大发挥所有劳动人民的生产积极性，才能保证社会主义建设事业的胜利前进。
