Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd: Yesterday in Lhasa, in the Norbulingka (Summer Palace) of the Dalai Lama, more than two thousand children of various ethnic groups gathered to celebrate "Children's Day." Under the shade of willow trees, the flags of the Young Pioneers of China were planted. The children ran happily on the lawn. Their parents had dressed them in their most beautiful clothes.

In the Norbulingka, the children danced and sang hand in hand. Some chased each other, shouting with joy; some crawled happily on the green grass; others laughed, rolled, and somersaulted. Under the old willow trees, the young drummers of the children's band were enthusiastically beating their drums.

On another patch of grass, young wrestlers engaged in competition.

In a grove of white poplars, dozens of children were listening to Tsering Choyang, the captain of the No. 1 detachment of the Young Pioneers of Lhasa Primary School, tell stories. A group of very young girls played "finding friends" in the shade of the trees.

The children's cheers suddenly came from another grove, where more than a hundred children were meeting with Han Young Pioneers, shaking hands and cheering enthusiastically. These six Han Young Pioneers were young actors from the Lhasa Qin Opera Troupe. They were pulled and embraced by their Tibetan and Hui friends to play games together.

As soon as a motorcycle entered the gate of the Norbulingka, the children immediately ran over to help their guests push the vehicle. Sitting on the motorcycle was Xuekang Shideng Nima, the vice chairman of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association. Also coming to celebrate the festival with the children were Bai Yunfeng, the secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and Liang Feng, the deputy secretary. They brought the children holiday gifts of candy and picture books. The state-owned Tibet Trade Corporation and Xinhua Bookstore both set up children's service departments in the Norbulingka.

    拉萨两千多儿童欢度“六一”节
    据新华社拉萨2日电　在拉萨，达赖喇嘛家的林卡里，两千多名各族儿童昨天欢聚一起度过了“六一”儿童节。柳荫下插着中国少年先锋队的队旗。孩子们欢天喜地的奔跑在草坪上。他们的父母，都用最美丽的衣服把他们打扮起来了。
    林卡里，孩子们手拉着手跳舞唱歌。有的欢叫着互相追赶，有的在绿草地上高兴的爬着，有的大笑着打滚和翻斤斗。古柳树下，儿童乐队的小鼓手们，正起劲地敲打着。
    另一片草地上，小摔跤手们展开了竞赛。
    一片白杨丛里，几十个孩子正在听拉萨小学少先队一中队长泽仁群扬讲故事。一群很小的女孩子在树荫下玩着“找朋友”游戏。
    孩子们的欢呼声突然从另一片树林里传出来，一百多个孩子正在那里和汉族少先队员会见，他们热情地握手、欢呼。这六个汉族少先队员是拉萨秦剧队的小演员。他们被藏、回族朋友拉着拥着一起去作游戏。
    一辆摩托车刚进林卡的大门，孩子们马上跑过去帮助他们的客人推车子，坐在摩托车上的是拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会的副主任委员雪康·士登尼玛。来和孩子们一起过节的，还有新民主主义青年团西藏工委书记白云峰和副书记梁枫，他们带给孩子的过节礼物是糖果和画报。国营西藏贸易总公司和新华书店都在林卡里设了儿童服务部。
