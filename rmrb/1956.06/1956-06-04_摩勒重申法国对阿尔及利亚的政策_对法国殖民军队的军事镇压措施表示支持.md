Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 3rd: The French National Assembly concluded its three-day debate on the government's general policies on June 2nd.

    As in the previous two days, the debate on the 2nd focused on the North African issue. Right-wing members of parliament demanded that the suppression policy be intensified in Algeria.

    The French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, defended the government's policy in Algeria. He announced that there are currently 364,000 troops stationed in Algeria, and stated that the government intends to rely on strong military force to "pacify" the country.

    French Prime Minister Mollet spoke before the end of the debate. He reiterated that his government hopes to negotiate with representatives of the Algerian people who are produced through free elections, which will be held three months after calm is restored in Algeria.

    Mollet said that after calm is restored, France does not want to restore the "old order" in Algeria, but to establish a "new order." He reiterated that the government will carry out large-scale "reforms" in administrative, economic and social aspects.

    However, Mollet also emphasized that the Algerian issue cannot be resolved in the same way as the issues of Tunisia and Morocco were resolved. He said that Algeria, on the one hand, cannot become a Muslim country, and on the other hand, it cannot become an ordinary province of France. He believes that the solution to the Algerian issue should become an example for solving the issue of French overseas territories.

    Mollet stated that his government fully supports Lacoste's suppression measures in Algeria.

    Finally, Mollet asked the parliament to hold a vote of confidence on the government's economic and social policies, policies towards Tunisia and Morocco, and policies towards Algeria.

    The vote of confidence will be held on the 5th.

    摩勒重申法国对阿尔及利亚的政策
    对法国殖民军队的军事镇压措施表示支持
    据新华社3日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会在六月二日结束了为期三天的对政府总政策的辩论。
    像前两天一样，二日的辩论集中在北非问题上。右翼议员要求在阿尔及利亚加紧执行镇压政策。
    法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特为政府在阿尔及利亚的政策辩护。他宣布目前驻在阿尔及利亚的军队有三十六万四千人，并且表示政府打算依靠强大的兵力来“平定”这个国家。
    法国总理摩勒在辩论结束之前发言。他重申，他的政府希望同通过自由选举而产生的阿尔及利亚人民的代表谈判，这种选举将在阿尔及利亚恢复平静后三个月举行。
    摩勒说，在平静恢复以后，法国不想在阿尔及利亚恢复“旧秩序”，而是要建立一种“新秩序”。他重申政府将在行政、经济和社会方面进行大规模“改革”。
    但是摩勒又强调，不能用解决突尼斯和摩洛哥问题的方式来解决阿尔及利亚问题。他说，阿尔及利亚一方面不能成为回教国，另一方面也不能成为法国的一个普通省份。他认为，解决阿尔及利亚问题的办法应当成为解决法国海外领地问题的实例。
    摩勒表示，他的政府充分支持拉戈斯特在阿尔及利亚的镇压措施。
    最后，摩勒要求议会对政府的经济和社会政策、突尼斯和摩洛哥政策以及阿尔及利亚政策举行一次信任投票。
    信任投票将在五日举行。
