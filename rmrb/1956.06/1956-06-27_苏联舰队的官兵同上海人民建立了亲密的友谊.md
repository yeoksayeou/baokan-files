    The Officers and Men of the Soviet Fleet Establish a Close Friendship with the People of Shanghai
        "Reason" and "Enlightenment"
    This newspaper Shanghai, June 25th dispatch: This afternoon, Lieutenant Commander Brovko, captain of the Soviet Navy torpedo destroyers "Reason" and Lieutenant Commander Zheleko, captain of the destroyer "Enlightenment," which are in Shanghai for a friendly visit, visited a woman named Xia Guilan at Shanghai Guangci Hospital. Xia Guilan gave birth to twin boys at one o'clock in the morning on the twentieth of this month, the first day of the Soviet friendly visit to China fleet's arrival in Shanghai. Both are very healthy. To commemorate this precious day, the young father and mother named the older child "Reason" and the younger child "Enlightenment."
    This afternoon, Lieutenant Commander Brovko and Lieutenant Commander Zheleko visited Xia Guilan and her two babies in the ward, inquired whether the mother had enough milk, and gave each of the two children a Soviet Navy military hat and many baby clothes, shoes and hats. The young father, Wang Jianguo, and mother, Xia Guilan, thanked Lieutenant Commander Brovko and Lieutenant Commander Zheleko for their condolences and said that they would educate their children to be as strong and brave as the Soviet Navy uncles.
          Letters Send Friendship
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 26th dispatch: "We feel very happy. Yesterday we saw the Soviet Navy comrades with our own eyes. Today, we are standing by the Huangpu River looking forward, hoping to see you again and spend a longer time with you, whether it is singing and dancing, or talking." This is a letter written to the Soviet visiting fleet by a group of residents on Jinling East Road in Shanghai.
    During the Soviet fleet's visit to Shanghai, the Peace Hotel, which hosted the Soviet fleet officers and men, received a large number of letters sent to Soviet friends every day. Almost every letter was accompanied by a gift: photos, commemorative badges, exquisite bookmarks, stamps, red scarves, etc. Many letters had words like these left on the cover: "Postman comrade, please be sure to send it," "Please send it as soon as possible."
    These letters came from factories, troops, government offices, hospitals, schools, street neighborhoods, and workers' sanatoriums. A sick girl wrote a letter from the hospital to greet Vice Admiral Chekurov, and a No. 7 player from an amateur basketball team wrote a letter to the No. 7 player of the Soviet fleet basketball team, asking to establish friendship with him.
        An Exquisite Ivory Seal
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 26th dispatch: Vice Admiral Chekurov, commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, received a very exquisite ivory seal on the evening of the 25th. On the side of the ivory seal, which is less than one square inch, are engraved two thousand and forty-seven Chinese characters. This is the full text of Vice Admiral Chekurov's moving speech at the welcoming ceremony held when the Soviet fleet arrived in Shanghai, and the full text of the welcoming speeches by Shanghai Deputy Mayor Xu Jianguo and Chinese East Sea Fleet Commander Tao Yong. These many words make up a peace dove, an anchor, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, and a auspicious ? symbol. Only under a magnifying glass can the shape of the characters be clearly seen. The bottom of the seal is engraved with Chekurov's name in Chinese and Russian. This is a gift from Li Yida, a Shanghai handicraft worker, to Vice Admiral Chekurov, which he rushed to carve in five days and four nights.
    In a letter to Chekurov, Li Yida said that the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union deeply moved him, a craftsman who had painful experiences in the old society. This visit of the Soviet fleet will move all the people of Shanghai and China as much as him.

    苏联舰队的官兵同上海人民建立了亲密的友谊
        “智谋”和“启蒙”
    本报上海25日电　今天下午，来上海作友好访问的苏联海军雷击舰“智谋号”和“启蒙号”舰长布罗夫京海军中校，哲列柯海军少校到上海广慈医院探望了一个名叫夏桂兰的产妇。夏桂兰在苏联友好访华舰队到达上海的第一天——本月二十日早晨一点钟一胎生了两个男孩子，身体都非常健康。年轻的爸爸和妈妈为了纪念这个可贵的日子，把大孩子取名叫“智谋”，小孩子取名叫“启蒙”。
    今天下午，布罗夫京海军中校和哲列柯少校在病房里探望夏桂兰和她的两个婴儿的时候，询问了孩子妈妈奶水是否充足，并赠送给两个孩子各人一顶苏联海军军帽和许多婴儿衣服、鞋帽。年轻的爸爸王建国和妈妈夏桂兰感谢布罗夫京中校和哲列柯少校的慰问，并表示要把孩子教育成像苏联海军叔叔一样的坚强勇敢。
          书信寄友情
    据新华社上海26日电　“我们感到非常幸福，昨天我们已经亲眼看到了苏联海军同志们。今天，我们又站在黄浦江边眺望着，希望再看到你们一次，和你们在一起度过一个较长的时间，唱歌跳舞也好，谈话也好。”这是上海金陵东路的一群居民写给苏联访华舰队的一封信。
    苏联舰队访问上海期间，接待苏联舰队官兵的和平饭店每天都收到寄送给苏联朋友们的大批信件。差不多每封信里都附着礼物：相片、纪念章、精美的书签、邮票、红领巾等等。许多封信的封面都留下这样的话：“邮递员同志，请你一定寄到”、“你尽可能尽速寄到”。
    这些信件来自工厂、部队、机关、医院、学校、街道里弄和工人疗养院等。一位生病的女孩从医院里写了一封信来问候切库罗夫海军中将，一个业余篮球队的七号队员写信给苏联舰队篮球队七号队员，要求和他建立友谊。
        一颗精致的象牙图章
    新华社上海26日电　苏联太平洋舰队司令切库罗夫海军中将在二十五日晚上收到一颗非常精致的象牙图章。在不到一平方寸的象牙图章的侧面，刻着二千零四十七个中国字。这是苏联舰队到达上海时举行的欢迎仪式上切库罗夫海军中将的动人的演说全文，和上海市副市长许建国、中国东海舰队司令陶勇海军中将的欢迎词全文。这许多字组成了和平鸽、铁锚、中国和苏联的国旗和一个象征吉祥如意的?。只有在放大镜底下，才能看清楚字形。图章的底面刻着切库罗夫名字的中文和俄文。这是上海的手工艺工人李义达送给切库罗夫海军中将的礼物，是他花了五天四夜赶刻成的。
    李义达在写给切库罗夫的信上说，中苏两国人民深厚的友谊，使他这个在旧社会中有过痛苦经历的手工艺人深深受到感动。这次苏联舰队的访问，全上海、全中国人民都会和他一样感动。
