    I fully agree with and endorse Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee.
    With the construction of the motherland and the upsurge of the nationwide cooperative movement, our pastoral areas have also actively supported the construction of the motherland and launched a pastoral cooperative movement in order to complete the common cause of all ethnic groups in the motherland. At present, the cooperative movement in pastoral areas is advancing in a "cautious and steady" manner. Not only in quantity, but also in quality, it is constantly being consolidated and developed. Thanks to the correct policies of the Party and the government for developing the pastoral economy, the economy of pastoral areas has developed rapidly in recent years, people's lives have been greatly improved, and a new atmosphere of "prosperity for people and livestock" has emerged. Taking the development of our own cooperative as an example, when the cooperative was first established in early 1954, there were a total of 13 member households, 32 male and female laborers, and 2,672 head of livestock of all sizes. In 1956, the number of member households increased to 39, the number of male and female laborers increased to 92, and the number of livestock of all sizes increased to 8,364.
    Due to scattered management and nomadic grazing, more than 200 households in a Sumu (district) are scattered within a range of two to three hundred *li*, and 34 households in a Baga (village) are scattered within a range of 100 *li*. Therefore, the difficulty of labor shortage is very serious, especially every year when autumn arrives, we are too busy to cope with it, because many of the year's work in pastoral areas is done during this period, such as fattening livestock, mowing grass, preparing for winter and the coming spring, and so on. If these things are not done well, livestock losses will be great in winter and spring. Since the establishment of the cooperative, due to the unified management of livestock and the rational organization of labor, the enthusiasm of every male, female, old, and young laborer has been brought into play. For example, young and middle-aged laborers can go to graze far away, while the elderly and the weak can raise old, weak, and disabled livestock at home, and can allocate manpower to mow grass, repair sheds and stables, and improve the feeding and management of livestock. Last year, our cooperative mowed more than 2 million *jin* of grass, which enabled us to raise more than 700 head of old and weak livestock. In 1955, the survival rate of livestock reached 98%, while in the past, the survival rate of livestock could only reach 60% to 70%. The production of livestock products such as milk and wool has also increased. In addition to our own consumption, in 1955 we sold more than 2,000 *jin* of milk and more than 3,000 *jin* of wool to the state, and also sold more than 100 sheep and more than 30 cattle to the state. This year, we plan to build 17 houses in order to gradually settle down. In short, thanks to the organization of production cooperatives, the difficulty of labor shortage has been resolved, the grazing management of livestock has been improved, livestock products have also increased, the income of our cooperative members has increased, and life has been greatly improved compared to the past. Everyone now demands to move to advanced cooperatives.
    Fellow representatives, although the backward state inherited from history in our pastoral areas still exists, it may make the socialist transformation slower than in other advanced areas. However, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our pastoral areas are determined and confident to change that backward state, and strive to complete the socialist transformation, and unite closely with the people of all ethnic groups in the country to enter socialist society together.

### 牧区出现了“人畜两旺”的新气象——胡和勒泰代表的发言

    牧区出现了“人畜两旺”的新气象
    ——胡和勒泰代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告和廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程的说明，以及彭真副委员长关于常务委员会的工作报告。
    随着祖国的建设和全国合作化运动的高涨，我们牧业地区也同样为了完成祖国各族人民的共同事业，积极的支援了祖国的建设，并掀起了牧业合作化的运动。现在牧区的合作化运动正以“谨慎稳妥”的步骤向前迈进着，不仅是数量上，而且质量上都不断的巩固和发展着，由于党和政府对发展牧业经济政策的正确，几年来牧业地区的经济发展很快，人民生活得到了很大的改善，出现了“人畜两旺”的新气象。从我们一个社的发展情况来说，在1954年初建社的时候，社员户数共13户，男女劳动力32名，大小牲畜2，672头，而1956年社员户数增加为39户，男女劳动力增加为92名，大小牲畜增加为8，364头。
    由于分散经营，游动放牧，一个苏木
  （区）200多户，就分散在二、三百里范围之内，一个巴嘎（村）34户就分散在100里范围之内，因此劳动力缺乏的困难是很严重的，特别是每年一到秋季的时候就忙不过来，因为牧业地区一年的好多工作就在这个时期做，例如，牲畜抓膘，打草，做好冬季及明春的准备工作等等。这些事情如果做不好，就到冬、春季时候牲畜损失很大。建社以来，由于牲畜的统一经营和劳动力的合理组织，便发挥了每个男女、老幼劳动力的积极性，例如青壮年劳动力可以到远处去放牧，而年老和身体弱的人，可以在家饲养老弱残牲畜，并且可以分出人力打草，修棚厩，改善牲畜的饲养管理。我们社去年打了200多万斤草，这样把700多头老弱牲畜饲养过来了。1955年牲畜成活率达到98％，而过去牲畜成活率只能达到60％至70％，牛奶和羊毛等畜产品也增加了，除自己吃用以外，1955年卖给国家牛奶2，000多斤，羊毛3，000多斤，还卖给国家100多只羊，30多头牛。今年我们准备盖17间房子，以便逐渐定居下来。总之，由于组织了生产合作社，劳动力的困难解决了，牲畜的放牧管理改善，畜产品也增加了，我们的社员的收入增加了，生活比过去有了很大的改善，大家现在都要求转入高级社。
    各位代表，我们牧业地区从历史上遗留下来的落后状态虽仍存在，因而使社会主义的改造事业进行的时候，可能比其它先进地区缓慢一些。但是我们牧区人民群众在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，有决心和有信心改变那种落后状态，并努力完成社会主义的改造事业，和全国各族人民亲密团结，一道进入社会主义社会。
