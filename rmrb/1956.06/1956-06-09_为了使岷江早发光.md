    To Make the Min River Shine Early
    By Our Correspondent Li Ce
    The Min River originates in the Min Mountains in northwestern Sichuan, flows through the mountains of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, rushes south, passes through the western Sichuan Plain, and joins the Jinsha River in Yibin, flowing into the Yangtze River. In order to meet the needs of socialist construction in industry and agriculture in Sichuan, the People's Government has re-surveyed the water resources of the Min River. In July 1955, three Soviet experts traveled throughout the upper reaches of the Min River. After observation and analysis, they suggested the comprehensive utilization of the Min River's water resources. Based on this suggestion, several large hydroelectric power stations will be built in the upper reaches of the Min River. The industrial and rural areas on both banks of the middle and lower reaches of the Min River will have sufficient water sources, and water can be diverted to irrigate the hills, increasing paddy fields by more than one million mu. Timber from the upper reaches of the Min River will float down along the river.
    Since July of last year, the state has conducted a large-scale survey of the water resources of the Min River. The survey teams, regardless of day or night, wind or rain, carried instruments and tents and traveled throughout the vast land on both sides of the Min River, visiting the large and small tributaries of the Min River. They lived a mobile field life all year round.
    The entire team launched a labor competition. The upper reaches of the Min River have many mountainous forests, and it is difficult to measure during the rainy season. The group led by Zhang Zhaonan adopted the "flag insertion method" to ensure the quality of measurement in hidden areas. The upper reaches of the Min River have rapid currents. Chen Lizhi and Zhang Zirong created the "aerial probing method" to measure the cross-section of the river.
    Many team members were unfamiliar with the work. Those who understood some of the work were also far from meeting the requirements. Everyone worked hard to learn on the spot. Survey worker Wu Xueshi was transferred to lead a survey team composed of interns and temporary workers. He worked with the team members to study the technology and strictly abide by Soviet surveying norms and operating procedures. The progress and quality of the survey met the requirements. The group led by Zhang Guohua consisted entirely of interns. When they encountered difficulties in their work, they turned to textbooks and lecture notes to study together. They climbed high mountains on sunny days and ran through hilly areas on rainy days. In order to save the round-trip time from the survey area to the accommodation, they sometimes carried two days' worth of dry food and surveyed in the field. Baihuatan is the area with the most complex geological structure in the Min River. They took the initiative to do an eight-kilometer "large scraping surface map" with another group, clarified the geological structure of this area, and provided very important design data in a timely manner.
    Although the team members worked very hard, they did not take good care of their household affairs. In the accommodation, dirty clothes and smelly socks were everywhere. The nurses traveled dozens of miles every day to various camps and survey areas to conduct mobile medical services. Deng Chaofen did the work of two people. Wherever she went, in addition to medical care, she also mended clothes, aired quilts, cleaned the houses, and helped the cooks chop vegetables and cook rice for the team members. She even unceremoniously urged the team members to change clothes and wash socks. Nurse Deng Jinzhong replaced sick team members at work. When going to the survey area, he also delivered meals and notices to the team members, bringing the most concerned letters and newspapers. When the cooks ran out of firewood, he helped chop wood. Under the nurses' kind care and urging, the team members' dressing, eating, and environmental hygiene are now much better.
    The local party committees and administrative organs on both sides of the Min River have vigorously supported the survey team members. When the survey team members went to the source of the Min River, where the land was vast and sparsely populated, the leading organs of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan sent people to guide them. When conducting economic surveys, the relevant county people's committees sent more than a dozen staff members to assist them. The postal and telecommunications departments treated letters and telegrams to the survey team members as urgent items and often sent them by special personnel. When the bus company saw team members coming to take the bus, no matter how many passengers there were, they tried to let the team members go first. The local grain and commercial departments ensured that the team members had an adequate supply of grain and materials and provided various conveniences. The team members received enthusiastic hospitality wherever they went. This is not difficult to understand. The people are looking forward to the early generation of electricity from the Min River Hydropower Station and are always willing to serve the hydropower station.

### 为了使岷江早发光

    为了使岷江早发光
    本报记者　李策
    岷江发源于四川西北的岷山山脉，穿过阿坝藏族自治州的群山，奔流南下，经过川西平原，在宜宾跟金沙江汇合，流入长江。人民政府为了适应四川工业、农业社会主义建设的需要，重新勘测了岷江的水力资源。1955年七月，三位苏联专家走遍了岷江上游，观察、分析以后，建议综合利用岷江水力资源。根据这个建议，在岷江上游将要建设几座较大的水力发电站。岷江中、下游两岸城市的工业、农村将得到充分的水源，丘陵地带将可以引水灌地，增加水田一百万亩以上。岷江上游的木材，将顺着岷江漂流下来。
    去年七月以来，国家对岷江水力资源进行了大规模的勘测。勘测队伍不分白天黑夜，风吹雨淋，带着仪器、帐篷，走遍了岷江两岸广大的土地，访问了岷江两岸的大小支流。他们成年累月地过着流动的野外生活。
    全队开展了劳动竞赛。岷江上游山地森林多，碰上多雨季节，不好测量。张肇南领导的小组采用“插旗法”，保证了隐蔽地区测量的质量。岷江上游水流湍急，陈历之、张自荣创造了“架空测探法”，测量江的横断面。
    很多队员都不熟悉业务。懂得一些业务的人，也跟工作要求相差很远。大家就在现场努力学习。测量工人吴学诗被调去领导一个由实习生、临时工人组成的勘测小组，就跟组员们共同研究技术，一丝不苟地遵守苏联测量规范和操作规程，测量的进度和质量都符合要求。张国华领导的小组，都是实习生，在工作中碰上困难，就翻课本找讲义，共同研究。他们晴天爬高山，雨天跑丘陵地带。为了节省从测量地区到住宿地的往返时间，他们有时带上两天干粮在野外测量。白花滩是岷江地质构造最复杂的地区。他们主动地跟另一个小组做了八公里的“大刮面图”，弄清了这一带地质构造，及时地提供了十分重要的设计资料。
    别看队员们工作得十分紧张，家务事料理得却不好。在住宿地，脏衣服、臭袜子到处都是。护士们每天走几十里路到各个宿营地、勘测区进行巡回医疗。邓朝芬一个人干两个人的活，每到一处，除了医疗以外，还给队员们补衣服、晒被盖，打扫屋地，帮助炊事员切菜煮饭。她甚至很不客气地催促队员们换衣服，洗袜子。护士邓尽忠，代替生病的队员工作。去勘测地区的时候，他还给队员们送饭、送通知，带去人们最关心的信件、报纸。碰上炊事员没柴烧，就帮助砍柴。在护士们亲切的关怀和督促下，队员们的穿衣、吃饭和环境卫生，现在都很像个样子了。
    岷江两岸地方党委、行政机关竭力支持勘测队员们。勘测队员们走到岷江源头，那里地旷人稀，四川阿坝藏族自治州的领导机关就派人给他们带路。进行经济调查的时候，有关县人民委员会都派出十几个工作人员协助他们。邮电部门接到给勘测队员们的信件、电报，当作急件处理，常常派专人专送。公共汽车公司看见队员来搭车，无论旅客怎样多，都设法叫队员们先走。各地粮食、商业部门，保证队员有充足的粮食、物资供应，并且给予各种方便。队员们无论走到哪里都受到热情的招待。这是不难理解的，人民盼望岷江水力发电站早点发电，随时愿意为水力发电站服务。
