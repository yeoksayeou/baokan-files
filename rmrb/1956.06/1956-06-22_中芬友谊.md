　　Sino-Finnish Friendship
　　Yesterday, distinguished guests from a friendly country far away – the Finnish Parliamentary Delegation – arrived in Beijing and were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. This delegation, comprising representatives from six parties in the Finnish Parliament, visiting China is a new symbol of the development of friendly relations between China and Finland.
　　Finland is in Northern Europe and China is in East Asia. The distance is quite far, but the geographical separation has not affected the friendly countries, who both love peace, from increasing mutual understanding and exchanges. China and Finland have never had disputes, have always respected each other, and share a common desire to safeguard peace. This constitutes a good foundation for friendship between the two countries. On this basis, since the establishment of diplomatic relations, in a short period of more than six years, both countries have achieved satisfactory development in diplomatic, economic, and cultural aspects.
　　In recent years, the friendly exchanges between the governments and people of China and Finland have greatly enhanced mutual understanding and strengthened friendship between the two peoples. The visits to China by the Finnish cultural delegation led by the wife of the current President Kekkonen in 1953 and the Finnish cultural delegation led by Yrjö Ylppö in 1955, the visit to Finland by Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of China in 1954, as well as the mutual visits of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe, and Finnish artists, have exchanged mutual friendship time and again, bringing the two peoples closer together.
　　In terms of economic relations, since the normalization of trade relations between the two countries in 1952, the trade volume has increased year by year. According to the agreements between the two sides, the total import and export volume of the two countries was 34 million rubles each in 1952, 47 million rubles in 1953, 50 million rubles in 1954, and increased to 60 million rubles in 1955. The implementation of the agreements has been relatively good. These continuously expanding and developing trades are conducted entirely on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which is in line with the interests of both countries in developing peaceful economies. This trade also has broad prospects.
　　From their own historical experience, the Finnish people deeply understand the correctness and necessity of a policy of peace and neutrality, and they have resolutely pursued and defended this policy in recent years. Former Finnish President Paasikivi once said: In Finnish history, it has happened time and again that the losses caused by guns had to be compensated by pens. President Kekkonen, in refuting the fallacy of demanding a change in this policy, pointed out: "We should sincerely adhere to the current foreign policy, and only in this way can we consolidate the position of our country, consolidate the freedom and independence of our country."
　　The government and people of the People's Republic of China have always been unswervingly loyal to promoting the cause of friendship and international cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and have a high evaluation of the results of the Finnish government's implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality. This policy is not only in line with the fundamental interests of Finland, but also a contribution to the cause of maintaining world peace and developing international cooperation. The Chinese people, who are engaged in building socialism through peaceful labor, deeply understand the Finnish people's desire to build their country in an environment of international peace and cooperation.
　　Finland's relations with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have also greatly increased recently. All of these are conducive to consolidating the cause of European and world peace and security.
　　The Finnish government's implementation of an independent foreign policy of peace has led Finland onto a path of peaceful development. Unlike the fate of those countries that are attached to aggressive military blocs, it is not threatened with being dragged into war adventures and does not have to bear the heavy burden of expanding armaments and preparing for war. This policy is in line with the wishes of the Finnish people and is therefore supported by the Finnish people.
　　Peace is indivisible, and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is not only possible but also necessary. Many facts in the international arena in recent times have proved that increasing exchanges and contacts between the peoples of all countries is of utmost importance for promoting mutual understanding, enhancing friendship, and thus strengthening peace. The development of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Finland in recent years and the benefits that this friendly relationship has brought to the peoples of both countries are good examples of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries with different systems. It proves with increasing force the correctness of the principle of peaceful coexistence as a norm of international relations.
　　The Chinese people are willing to befriend the people of all countries. Friends who come to visit China will feel that they have come to a cordial and friendly land. Through this visit of the Finnish Parliamentary Delegation, the friendship between China and Finland will be further enhanced.

    中芬友谊
    昨天，来自远方的友好国家的贵宾——芬兰议会代表团到达了北京，受到中国人民的热诚欢迎。这个包括芬兰议会中六个党派的代表团的访问中国，是中芬两国友好关系发展的一个新的标志。
    芬兰在北欧，中国在东亚，距离是相当远的，但是地理上的阻隔，并没有影响这两个爱好和平的友好国家增进相互间的了解和往来。中芬两国从来没有发生过纠纷，一向互相尊重，又有维护和平的共同愿望，这构成了两国友谊的良好基础，在这个基础上两国自建交以来，短短六年多时间里，无论在外交、经济和文化方面，都获得了令人满意的发展。
    几年来，中芬两国政府和人民的友好交往，大大增进了两国人民之间的相互了解，加强了友谊。1953年以现任总统吉科宁的夫人为首的芬兰文化代表团和1955年以于尔柏为首的芬兰文化代表团的先后访问中国，1954年中国对外贸易部副部长雷任民的访问芬兰，以及中国杂技团、中国古典歌舞剧团和芬兰艺术家们的互相访问，一次次交流了相互的友情，使两国人民更加接近起来。
    在经济关系方面，自从1952年两国贸易关系正常化以来，贸易额逐年都有增长。根据双方的协定，1952年两国进出口各为三千四百万卢布，1953年为四千七百万卢布，1954年为五千万卢布，1955年增至六千万卢布。协定执行的情况是比较好的。这些不断扩大和发展的贸易，是完全在平等互利的基础上进行的，它符合于两国发展和平经济的利益。这种贸易还有它宽广的前景。
    芬兰人民从自己的历史经验中，深深地体会到和平中立政策的正确性和必要性，几年来他们坚决地推行和捍卫了这个政策。芬兰前总统巴锡基维曾说：在芬兰的历史上一再发生这样的情况，就是用枪杆所造成的损失不得不用笔杆来补偿。吉科宁总统在一次驳斥要求改变这个政策的谬论时指出：“应当诚心诚意地遵循现行的外交政策，也只有这样，我们才能够巩固我们国家的地位，巩固我们国家的自由和独立。”
    中华人民共和国政府和人民始终不渝地忠于促进各国人民友好和国际合作的事业，对芬兰政府执行和平中立政策的成果，有着很高的评价。这个政策，不仅符合于芬兰的根本利益，而且是对维护世界和平和发展国际合作的事业的一种贡献。正在从事建设社会主义的和平劳动的中国人民深切理解芬兰人民在国际和平和合作的环境中建设自己的国家的愿望。
    芬兰同苏联和其他人民民主国家的关系，最近也有了很大的增进。这都是有利于巩固欧洲和世界和平和安全的事业的。
    芬兰政府执行独立的和平外交政策，使芬兰走上了和平发展的道路。和那些依附侵略性军事集团的国家的遭遇不同，它不受可能被拖向战争冒险的威胁，无须承受扩军备战的沉重负担。这种政策符合于芬兰人民的愿望，因此得到芬兰人民的支持。
    和平是不可分割的，不同社会制度的国家的和平共处不仅是可能的，而且是必要的。最近一个时期来国际上的许多事实证明，各国人民之间增加交往和接触，对于促进相互之间的了解、增进友谊，从而加强和平有极重要的作用。中芬两国人民几年来友好关系的发展和这种友好关系带给两国人民的好处，是不同制度国家和平共处和友好合作的良好实例。它以日益增强的力量证明和平共处原则作为国际关系准则的正确性。
    中国人民是愿意同一切国家的人民交好的。来到中国访问的朋友们都会感到，他们是来到了亲切而友好的国土。通过芬兰议会代表团的这次访问，中芬两国的友谊将会得到更大的增进。
