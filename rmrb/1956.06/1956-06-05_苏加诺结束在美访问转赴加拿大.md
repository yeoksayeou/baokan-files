Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Indonesian President Sukarno concluded his nineteen-day visit to the United States on June 3rd and left Niagara Falls, New York, for Canada. He will make a five-day visit to Canada.

Before leaving the United States, Sukarno sent telegrams to the American people and U.S. President Eisenhower respectively. In his telegram to the American people, he asked Americans to understand "this era of Asian and African nationalism." He said that this is a matter that needs to be considered first in our modern world. American aid to other countries may be in vain if it does not have this necessary understanding and sympathy. In his telegram to Eisenhower, Sukarno thanked the U.S. authorities for their hospitality and emphasized the friendly ties between the two peoples.

On June 2nd, in a speech in San Francisco, Sukarno said that Asia's "explosive revolution" will continue until the demands of the disenfranchised are met and the fettered are freed. Sukarno's speech was delivered to the World Affairs Council of Northern California. In his speech, he condemned the negative consequences of colonialism for the people of Asia and Africa, and said that the people of Asian and African countries are tired of poverty, silence, and disenfranchisement, and they demand equal status in the world.

In the last few days of his trip in the United States, Sukarno visited places such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Salt Lake City.

    苏加诺结束在美访问转赴加拿大
    新华社4日讯　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在六月三日结束了他在美国的十九天访问，离开纽约州的尼亚加拉瀑布城前往加拿大。他将在加拿大作五天的访问。
    苏加诺在离开美国以前分别发出了给美国人民和美国总统艾森豪威尔的电报。他在给美国人民的电报里要求美国人了解
  “这个亚洲和非洲民族主义的时代”。他说，这是在我们现代世界中需要首先考虑的问题。美国对其他国家的援助如果不是具有这种必要的谅解和同情的话，可能是白费的。苏加诺在给艾森豪威尔的电报里感谢美国当局对他的招待，并且强调了两国人民之间的友谊联系。
    六月二日，苏加诺在旧金山发表的一篇演说里说，亚洲的“爆炸性革命”将要继续下去，直到没有权利的人的要求得到满足和受羁绊的人获得自由。苏加诺的演说是向北加利福尼亚世界事务委员会发表的。他在演说里谴责了殖民主义给亚洲和非洲人民带来的不良后果，并且说，亚洲和非洲国家的人民对贫困、无声无息和没有权利感到厌倦，他们要求在世界上地位平等。
    苏加诺在美国的最后几天行程中访问了洛杉矶、旧金山和盐湖城等地。
