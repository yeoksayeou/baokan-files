    Another New Achievement in the Paper Industry
    China Can Now Produce its Own Soft Steel Paper
    The steel paper workshop of the First Branch of the Mudanjiang Paper Mill has successfully trial-produced soft steel paper. After being appraised by relevant departments, the quality is considered good and it has now been officially put into production.
    This soft steel paper has a wide range of uses and can be used as sealing gaskets for various ventilation, air and oil pipes of trains, automobiles, ships and airplanes. The successful trial production of soft steel paper is another new achievement in China's paper industry, because in the past, the soft steel paper used in China's industry has always relied on imports from foreign countries. Domestically produced soft steel paper is cheaper than imported ones.

    造纸工业的又一新成就
    我国可以自制软钢纸
    牡丹江造纸厂第一分场钢纸车间试制软钢纸成功，经过有关部门鉴定认为质量良好，现在已经正式投入生产。
    这种软钢纸的用途很广，可以用作火车、汽车、轮船和飞机等各种通风、通气和通油管的密封垫片。软钢纸的试制成功是我国造纸工业的又一项新成就，因为过去我国工业上使用的软钢纸一向都是依靠从国外进口。国产的软钢纸比进口的价钱要低。
