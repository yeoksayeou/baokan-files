Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 16th - The Bengbu and Fuyang Special Districts in Anhui Province are taking various measures to make up for the losses caused by flooding to summer crops.

    The Fuyang Special District plans to replant corn and other high-yield and early-maturing crops on 3.8 million mu of spring-sown crop land; the planned sweet potato planting area will be increased from 4.9 million mu to 7 million mu. At the same time, farmers are being mobilized to plant more melons and vegetables on vacant and waste land. After these measures are taken, the Fuyang Special District can still complete this year's grain production plan.
    The Bengbu Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also decided to use methods such as expanding the planting area of high-yield crops, increasing the summer planting index, increasing the yield per unit area, and utilizing wasteland for multiple plantings and harvests to strive for an increase of 1.67 billion jin of grain. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, the Bengbu Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken measures such as strengthening drainage and paying attention to water storage and conservation, increasing fertilizer and large-scale intercropping of green manure, and timely raising, transferring, and transporting seeds to supply farmers.

    安徽受涝地区补种高产和早熟作物
    新华社合肥16日电　安徽省蚌埠、阜阳两个专区正采取各种办法来弥补夏季作物受涝的损失。
    阜阳专区计划在三百八十万亩春种作物地里补种玉米等高产和早熟作物；甘薯的栽种面积计划由四百九十万亩增加到七百万亩。同时发动农民在空地废地上多种瓜菜。采取这些办法以后，阜阳专区仍可完成今年粮食生产计划。
    中共蚌埠地方委员会也决定用扩大高产作物种植面积、增加夏种指数、提高单位面积产量和利用废地多种多收等办法，争取增产十六亿七千万斤粮食。为保证这一计划的实现，中共蚌埠地方委员会采取了加强排涝并注意蓄水保水，增加肥料和大量套种绿肥，及时筹集调运种子供应农民等措施。
