A Timely Warning to the United States Is in Order
Xiao Guang
Due to deliberate sabotage by the United States, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in southern Korea was forced to withdraw from South Korea on June 9th. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in northern Korea, following instructions from higher authorities, also temporarily withdrew to Panmunjom headquarters on June 11th. However, as United Press International reported, the United States is still not satisfied with the measures it has already taken, namely, "declaring the Neutral Nations Supervisory System a failure and refusing to cooperate to continue to respect the system." Therefore, only a few days after the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission withdrew from South Korea, the United States busied itself with troop deployments, replacing weapons, and creating war hysteria.

On the third day after the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission withdrew from South Korea, Syngman Rhee began to increase troops to the Military Demarcation Line to strengthen so-called "defensive capabilities." Syngman Rhee also wanted the South Korean army to be prepared to fight at any time the United States needed it and in any location in the world. The United States Department of Defense has taken measures to transport a large amount of modern equipment, including atomic weapons, into South Korea to replace the existing weapons of the US military. Senior US military officers stationed in South Korea are being rotated back to the United States for training at a special training center. All American soldiers and South Korean troops are also receiving atomic warfare training. To assess their proficiency in so-called "defense against possible attacks," the United States Air Force recently conducted a three-day joint exercise with the South Korean jet fighter fleet. The United States and South Korean navies are also scheduled to hold large-scale exercises in the western Pacific at the end of June. Dulles repeatedly clamored in Washington that "American attack power may have to be used in Korea," and Syngman Rhee constantly shouted "March North" in Seoul. Echoing this duet of war, the United States is also preparing to freeze the meetings in Panmunjom and completely abolish the Korean Armistice Agreement. Robert Gard, the chief commissioner on the American side of the Korean Armistice Commission, openly stated his unwillingness for the Armistice Commission to meet again. Reuben Robertson, the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, bluntly stated that the United States must do "something" this year to abolish the Korean Armistice Agreement. The United States Department of Defense spokesman even admitted that the United States had long been creating "grounds" for formally abolishing the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The United States' war preparations in Korea prove that the United States is trying to use the destruction of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the creation of a war atmosphere to intensify the tension in the Far East. The famous American columnist David Lawrence has provided a good annotation for this. Lawrence believes that the actions of the United States are a "timely warning" to certain people, supposedly because these people are beginning to "blindly follow" the principle of peaceful coexistence.

However, the principle of peaceful coexistence is so deeply rooted in people's hearts. This general trend cannot be changed by the United States' military threats. Now, everyone realizes that the continued stability of the Korean Armistice is an important factor in maintaining peace in the Far East. The Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world will stand with the Korean people and resolutely safeguard the Korean Armistice Agreement. The vast majority of countries on the United Nations side are also unwilling to see the Korean Armistice being undermined. Thai public opinion's demand to withdraw all of its troops from Korea is one example. The United States' insistence on a war policy and its attempt to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement will only further isolate itself in the world. It is very clear that it is the United States itself, and not others, that should now accept a "timely warning."

    应该及时警告美国
    萧光
    因为美国的蓄意破坏，驻在朝鲜南部的中立国视察小组已在六月九日被迫撤出南朝鲜；驻在朝鲜北部的中立国视察小组也奉上级指示，在六月十一日暂时撤回板门店本部。然而，正如合众社所说的，美国对它已经采取的措施，即“宣布中立国视察制度是一个失败，并且拒绝进行合作来继续尊重这个制度”仍然不能满足。所以，中立国视察小组撤出南朝鲜仅仅几天，美国就忙着调兵遣将，更换武器，大事制造战争的歇斯底里。
    在中立国视察小组撤出南朝鲜的第三天，李承晚就开始向军事停战线增调部队，加强所谓“防御潜力”；李承晚并且要南朝鲜的军队准备好在美国需要它的任何时间和世界上任何地点进行战斗。美国国防部已经采取措施，准备把包括原子武器在内的大量现代化装备运进南朝鲜，替换美军的现有武器；驻在南朝鲜的美军高级军官被轮流派回美国，到一个特别训练中心去受训；所有的美国士兵和南朝鲜军队也都在受原子战争的训练。为了估价它们对所谓“防御可能发动的进攻”的熟练程度，美国空军最近和南朝鲜的喷气式战斗机队进行了一次为期三天的联合演习；美国和南朝鲜的海军也预定在六月底在西太平洋举行大规模的演习。杜勒斯在华盛顿一再叫嚷“美国的攻击力量可能必须在朝鲜使用”，李承晚在汉城不断狂呼“北进”。同这种一唱一和的战争双簧相呼应，美国还准备冻结板门店的会议，完全废除朝鲜停战协定。朝鲜停战委员会美国方面的首席委员罗伯特·加德公开表示不愿意停战委员会再开会。美国国防部副部长卢本·罗伯逊露骨地说，美国今年对废除朝鲜停战协定必须要作“一些事情”。美国国防部发言人甚至承认，美国早就在为正式废除朝鲜停战协定制造“根据”了。
    美国在朝鲜的备战行动证明，美国是在想用破坏朝鲜停战协定、制造战争气氛，来加剧远东紧张局势。这一点，美国著名的专栏作家戴维·劳伦斯已为它作了很好的注解。劳伦斯认为，美国的行动是对某些人的“及时的警告”，据说因为这些人开始“盲从”和平共处的原则。
    然而，和平共处的原则是这样的深得人心。这个大势已经不是美国的武力威胁所能改变得了的。现在，谁都认识到，朝鲜停战的继续稳定是维护远东和平的重要因素。中国人民和世界爱好和平的人民，将同朝鲜人民在一起，坚决维护朝鲜停战协定。联合国军方面的绝大多数国家，也都不愿意看到朝鲜停战遭到破坏。泰国舆论要求从朝鲜撤出它的全部军队，就是一个例子。美国坚持战争政策，企图破坏朝鲜停战协定，只能使它自己在全世界更加孤立。很明显，现在应该接受“及时的警告”的，不是别人，正是美国自己。
