Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to recruit 315 postgraduate students this year, an increase of more than five times compared to the fifty recruited last year.

This year, 236 scientists will serve as graduate student advisors, about four times the number last year. They are members of the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, senior researchers from research institutions, professors from universities, and Soviet experts. Some graduate student advisors are scientists who recently returned from capitalist countries and have doctorates or master's degrees. For example, the famous scientist Qian Xuesen, who returned from the United States last October, will train seven graduate students in five specialties such as "Cybernetics."

The Chinese Academy of Sciences has set up a total of 174 majors for graduate students this year, four times the number last year.

This year's graduate student entrance examinations will be held simultaneously in more than a dozen cities across the country from September 3rd to 5th; registration is tentatively scheduled to be accepted from mid-June to mid-August.
