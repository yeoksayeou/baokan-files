Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th. Commercial institutions have been widely spread throughout rural Henan. More than 70% of the province's farmers can buy daily necessities without leaving their villages during the current busy period of summer harvesting and planting. In the few villages without commercial institutions, supply and marketing cooperatives organize rural small traders and peddlers to adopt methods such as mobile visits to villages, door-to-door delivery, or holding night markets to facilitate farmers' purchase of goods and sales of products. In addition to supplying farmers with daily necessities and small farm tools, these commercial institutions and small traders also purchase farmers' small local products and waste materials. In the past, members of the Cao Suocheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Puyang County had to travel a long way to the market to purchase means of production and daily necessities, which resulted in an average loss of 1,120 workdays per month for the entire cooperative. This phenomenon no longer exists.

Eleven state-owned companies in the Henan commercial system set up their institutions in large market towns below the county seat in late May, establishing a total of 1,442 wholesale institutions. Recently, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also established nearly 20,000 wholesale and retail outlets, as well as distribution and consignment stores, in villages, based on the principles of "facilitating the masses and facilitating commodity circulation." A large number of mobile sales promotion groups have also been established. In this way, the commercial network in rural Henan has been largely formed.

    河南省农村里普遍设立了商业机构
    大部分农民不出村庄就能买到日用必需品
    新华社郑州8日电　商业机构已经较普遍地散布在河南农村。全省有70％以上的农民，在目前夏收夏种的紧张时期，不出村庄就能买到日用必需品。在少数没有商业机构的村庄，供销合作社组织农村小商小贩，采取流动串乡、送货上门或举行夜市等办法，便利农民购买商品和销售产品。这些商业机构和小商小贩，除了供应农民日用必需品和小农具以外，还收购农民的小土产和废品杂品。濮阳县曹锁成农业生产合作社的社员，过去因为购买生产资料和生活用品，要跑很远的路去赶集，全社平均每月要误工1，120个，现在这种现象没有了。
    河南省商业系统有十一个国营公司在五月下旬把机构下设到县城以下的大集镇，共建立批发机构1，442个。各地供销合作社最近也本着“便利群众，有利于商品流转”等原则，在村庄里建立了近两万个批发和零售门市部以及分销、代销店，还设立了大批商品流动推销小组。这样，河南农村的商业网就大体形成。
