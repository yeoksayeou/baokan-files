    Make the Life of Rural Party Grassroots Organizations Active
    —A Letter from a Party Member—To the Editor:
    Currently, in townships and villages that have established fully socialist cooperatives, the organizational form of the Party has been somewhat changed according to the needs of the work, but the content of Party life is still very unrich and inactive. In the general meetings of the general Party branch or the meetings of the branch, it is often only a matter of conveying instructions from the higher levels, arranging work, not conducting criticism and self-criticism, nor studying ideological conditions. Party meetings are held exactly like the cooperative management committee. This phenomenon exists in Chedang Township, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, and Miaquan Township, Changshu County. Precisely because of this, many ideological problems of Party members are not resolved, and many wrong views are not corrected. For example, in a discussion on the future of socialism in Miaquan Township, many confused views were exposed. Some said: "Now that socialism has been realized (referring to complete socialist cooperativization), everyone's life has not changed much. Is this what socialism is?" Some said: "Socialism seems to have reached the end, just missing an upstairs and downstairs." Some said: "Our village has already been cooperativized, now we are just waiting for the workers to build tractors."...
    The county and district committees should be held partly responsible for the unrich and inactive Party life in the countryside. Many county and district committees rarely study the issues of Party life; nor do they inspect the situation of Party life. After inspecting the production situation of thirty-two cooperatives in two townships, Sui Xingchu, the secretary of Changshu County Party Committee, made a summary report. This report talked about production problems very specifically and meticulously, which is of course good, but it did not mention the situation of Party life or the ideological situation of Party members.
    To enrich the life of rural Party grassroots organizations, the county and district committees need to strengthen their leadership over rural branches and help them enrich and activate Party life. Studying the Party and the state's guidelines and policies, discussing ideological issues within the Party, and inspecting the work style of Party members can all make Party life active. In Shibian Village, Miaquan Township, we read the joint directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily to four non-Party activists. We read a section and talked about it, and everyone studied with great interest and expressed a lot of their inner thoughts. Can't such study be considered a part of Party life? Strangely, at that time, this directive had been published for nearly a month, but many Party members in Miaquan Township did not know about it. No wonder some Party members say: "Our level of understanding is now about the same as the masses!"
    I hope that the county and district Party committees can pay attention to this issue, gradually enrich and activate rural Party life, and continuously improve the political and ideological level of Party members.

    让农村党的基层组织的生活活跃起来
    ——党员来信——编辑同志：
    目前，在已经建立了完全社会主义性质的合作社的乡、村，党的组织形式已根据工作需要作了某些改变，但是党的生活的内容还是很不丰富、很不活跃的。在总支部的党员大会上或分支部的党员大会上，经常只是传达上级指示，布置工作，不进行批评和自我批评，也不研究思想情况。党内会议开得和社管理委员会一模一样。江苏昆山县车荡乡、常熟县渺泉乡都有这种现象。正因为如此，党员中的许多思想问题得不到解决，许多错误看法得不到纠正。例如，渺泉乡党员在一次社会主义前途的漫谈会上，就暴露出不少糊涂的看法。有的说：现在已经实现社会主义了
  （指完全社会主义合作化），大家的生活没多大改变，难道社会主义就是这样的吗？”有的说：“社会主义好像跑到了头，就是差一个楼上楼下。”有的说：“咱们村子已经合作化了，现在就等工人造拖拉机。”……。
    农村党的生活不丰富不活跃，县区委要负一部分责任。许多县区委很少研究党内生活问题；也不检查党内生活的情况。常熟县县委书记隋性初同志在检查两个乡三十二个合作社的生产情况后作了一个总结报告，这个报告对生产问题谈的很具体很细致，这当然是好的，但是对于党的生活情况，党员思想情况就没有谈到。
    要丰富农村党基层组织的生活，需要县区委加强对农村支部的领导，帮助他们丰富党内生活，活跃党内生活。学习党和国家的方针政策，讨论党内的思想问题，检查党员的工作作风，都可以使党的生活活跃起来。在渺泉乡石边村，我们曾对四个非党积极分子读了一遍中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的联合指示，读一段，谈一段，大家学习得津津有味，并且谈出了很多心里话。难道不能把这样的学习作为党的生活的一项内容吗？奇怪的是，当时这个指示已经发表了将近一月，但渺泉乡许多党员还不知道。难怪有些党员要说：“我们现在和群众的认识水平差不多了！”
    我希望县区党委能够重视这个问题，逐渐使农村党的生活丰富、活跃起来，不断地提高党员的政治思想水平。
