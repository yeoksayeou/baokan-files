(I) Editor:

    I am a staff member of a certain agency library. After reading Li Guangyu's letter on the "Reader's Letters" page on May 27th, I deeply agree. Indeed, strengthening the organization and leadership of the second-hand book industry is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved.

    Currently, second-hand booksellers are generally individual stalls with very little capital. Although the stalls are small, they must be guarded by one person. Because second-hand books do not have a fixed source, procurement mainly relies on running around and making connections. The sales targets of second-hand books are mainly various agencies, organizations, schools, and libraries, which also require frequent contact. If second-hand booksellers do not have the manpower to go out and run around, they cannot procure enough goods or supply them in a timely manner. Because second-hand booksellers have little capital, they cannot buy expensive books; they also cannot buy many books when purchasing from other places. For example, second-hand booksellers in Beijing go to Tianjin to buy books, usually only carrying a few hundred yuan. Once they have bought enough, they return, and then go again after selling them. This wastes manpower and financial resources, which inevitably increases the price of books.

    Due to the decentralized operation of the second-hand book industry and individual procurement, some unreasonable phenomena have also arisen. For example, second-hand book prices in Beijing are very inconsistent. In Dong'an Market, two book stalls facing each other sometimes have prices that differ by as much as double for the same book. According to booksellers, this is the result of each household seeing different prices when procuring goods. Sometimes, separate procurement also creates a phenomenon of competition, which artificially increases the price of some second-hand books. In this situation, some book owners even hide their books and refuse to sell them. For example, I know a person who used to run a second-hand bookstore, but now he doesn't. However, he still has some books stored at home. A few months ago, he was still worried about not being able to sell those stored books, but recently he is unwilling to sell them, because he believes that second-hand books will definitely "increase in price" in the future.

    Therefore, I believe that in order for the second-hand book industry in various places to better serve scientific research work, relevant agencies in various places, and even the Ministry of Culture, should consider concrete measures to strengthen the organization and leadership of the second-hand book industry.

    Finally, I would also like to offer a suggestion to the acquisition of books by various agencies, organizations, and schools. In order to advance towards science and strengthen library and information work, it is absolutely necessary for various agencies, organizations, and schools to buy some books. However, a blind approach to buying books has already emerged. For example, a comrade from a unit in another place came to Beijing to buy books with a lot of money. When he arrived at the bookstore, he ordered all the books on a shelf to be packed up. This method of buying books without considering actual needs will cause chaos in the second-hand book market, so attention should be paid to preventing it.

(II) Editor:

    I agree with Comrade Li Guangyu's request. I have been running Ruiji Bookstore on the second floor of Tianjin Tianxiang Market since 1937, dealing in ancient books, foreign language books, etc., and supplying schools and agency libraries. In October 1955, my store was under the leadership of Xinhua Bookstore. Xinhua Bookstore asked me to immediately clear out the old books stored in the store. Because of the short time, a large number of valuable ancient books, foreign language books, original rubbings of steles, and picture albums were all sold by the catty, at a price of only two to three jiao per catty. I was very heartbroken to sell the books that I had collected little by little in this way. And I myself have also changed careers and am now selling new books.

    I have been in the second-hand book business for decades. I am willing to use my management expertise to contribute my strength to the work of collecting and preserving ancient books, to serve the scientific research work of various units.

    I am the person in charge of Wenguang Bookstore in Xidan Shopping Mall, Beijing. Because I often go to Tianjin to purchase second-hand books, I have learned about the situation of the second-hand book industry in Tianjin. I completely agree with the opinions raised in Li Guangyu's letter. In addition, I would like to add one point: the phenomenon of not paying attention to the second-hand book industry is not only in Tianjin, but also in other regions. For example, there used to be many vendors in Jinan City who were engaged in second-hand books, but now they are all led by Xinhua Bookstore to switch to selling new books. There is only one Beiyang Bookstore with an attached second-hand book department left. Just think, how can Jinan, such a city, with only one attached second-hand book department, do a good job in the collection and supply of second-hand books? In this case, it is very likely that many book owners can only sell second-hand books as waste paper, while many book-using units cannot buy second-hand books. The problem in Tianjin is about to be resolved, and I hope the problem in Jinan can also be resolved.

### 加强对旧书商贩的组织和领导

    加强对旧书商贩的组织和领导
                               （一）编辑同志：
    我是某机关图书馆的一个工作人员。看到五月二十七日“读者来信专页”上李光育的来信后，我深有同感。的确，加强对旧书业的组织和领导，在目前是一个急需解决的问题。
    目前旧书商一般都是一人一摊，资金很少。摊子虽然小，可非要一个人守着不可。因为旧书没有一定来源，进货主要是靠多跑，多联系。旧书的销售对象主要是各机关、团体、学校和图书馆，也需要经常联系。旧书商如果没有人力出去跑，就不能充分进货，也不能及时供应。旧书商因为资金少，价钱贵的书就不能买；到外地去采购也不能多买。譬如北京旧书业到天津去买书，一次不过带几百元，买够了就回来，卖出后再去。这样就浪费人力财力，必然会增加书价。
    由于旧书业分散经营，各自进货，也造成了一些不合理的现象。如北京旧书书价很不统一。在东安市场，对着面的两个书摊，同样一本书，有时书价相差一倍。据书商说，这就是各户进货时看价不一的结果。有时，分别进货还造成了争购的现象，使某些旧书的价格人为地提高了。在这种情况下，甚至有个别存书人把书藏起来不卖了。像我认识一个人，他过去经营旧书，现在不干了，但在家里还存了一些书。前几个月他还在愁那些存书卖不出去；但是最近却不愿意把那些书卖出去了，原因是他认为旧书将来一定要“涨钱”的。
    因此，我认为，为了使各地的旧书业能够更好地为科学研究工作服务，各地有关机关，甚至中央文化部都应该考虑加强对旧书业的组织和领导的具体措施。
    最后，我对各机关、团体、学校收购图书的工作也提一个意见。为了向科学进军，加强图书资料工作，各机关、团体、学校买一些书是完全必要的。但是目前已经出现了一种盲目买书的做法。如外地某单位一个同志带着很多钱到北京来买书，到了书铺，把一架子书都叫打起包来。这种不考虑实际需要的买书办法，将会使旧书市场出现混乱现象，因此应该注意防止。

                     （二）编辑同志：
    见到李光育同志的要求，我很同意。我从1937年起就在天津天祥市场二楼开设瑞记书局，经营古籍书、外文书等，供应学校、机关图书馆。1955年10月份，我店由新华书店领导。新华书店要我将店里所存的旧书立即清理。因为时间短促，大批有价值的古籍旧书、外文书籍和原拓的碑帖、画册等全论斤卖了，每斤价格只二角到三角。我一点一点搜罗来的书，全这样卖出去，感到非常痛心。而我自己也转了业，现在开始卖新书了。
    我几十年来一直在经营着旧书。我愿意发挥我的经营特长，把力量贡献给搜集和保存古籍旧书工作，为各单位的科学研究工作服务。
　郭兆瑞（三）编辑同志：
    我是北京西单商场文光书局的负责人。因为我经常到天津市收购旧书，了解了一些天津市旧书业的情况。我完全同意李光裕来信中所提的意见。此外，还想补充一点：不重视旧书业的现象，不光在天津有，在其它地区也有。例如，济南市原来有不少经营旧书的商贩，现在全归新华书店领导改营新书了，剩下一家北洋书社附设一个旧书部。请想一想，像济南这样一个城市，只剩下一个附设的旧书部，怎能做好旧书的收购和供应工作呢？在这种情况下，很可能发生许多藏书主只能把旧书当废纸卖了，而许多用书单位买不到旧书的情况。天津市的问题快解决了，希望济南市的问题也能够得到解决。
