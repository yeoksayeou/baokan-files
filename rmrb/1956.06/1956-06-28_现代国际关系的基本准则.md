    Basic Norms of Modern International Relations

    Two years ago today, the prime ministers of China and India issued a joint statement establishing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence—as the guiding principles for relations between the two countries. The next day, the prime ministers of China and Burma issued a joint statement affirming these Five Principles. The announcement of these Five Principles immediately garnered enthusiastic approval and support from the world, especially the people of Asia, and played a significant role in the development of the Asian situation.

    The development of the international situation over the past two years has shown that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, advocated by the prime ministers of China, India, and Burma, are increasingly demonstrating their vitality, generating an increasingly profound impact, and have become important norms guiding modern international relations.

    It is no accident that the prime ministers of China, India, and Burma were the first in the world to advocate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China, India, and Burma are all countries that have gained independence from colonial oppression not long ago. Their long-term common circumstances have given rise to a common desire: to safeguard their sovereignty and independence and to build their own countries. To realize these desires, a peaceful environment is necessary. The lessons of history have taught them that inciting suspicion and hostility, creating disputes and wars, are the usual means by which imperialism implements its policies of aggression and divide-and-rule in Asia. The establishment of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence has enabled Asian countries to establish sincere friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperative relations, thwarting the imperialists' conspiracies to sow discord among Asian countries, and establishing a vast zone of peace in Asia, thereby strengthening the independence, security, and development of these countries.

    Precisely because of this, the Five Principles have had a tremendous impact on promoting peace in Asia and mutual understanding and trust among Asian countries. At the Bandung Asian-African Conference, the Five Principles were extended and developed. As Asian and African countries interact with each other based on the spirit of the Bandung Conference and adhere to these principles, economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation between countries have greatly developed over the past two years. The spirit of these principles has also greatly strengthened the will and strength of Asian and African countries to safeguard their independence and sovereignty. More and more Asian and African countries are adopting independent, peaceful, and neutral policies in their foreign relations. They do not allow foreign interference in their internal affairs, and they resolutely do not participate in aggressive military alliances. The Asian-African zone of peace is expanding, and the United States' conspiracy to organize aggressive blocs and create tension in the Asian-African region has been increasingly severely hit. This has greatly improved the situation in the Asian-African region.

    As the initiators of the Five Principles, the friendship between China and India and China and Burma has been continuously strengthened over the past two years. Friendly cooperation between China and other Asian and African countries is also developing on the basis of the Five Principles. Indian Prime Minister Nehru has played a remarkable role in expanding the influence of the Five Principles and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Former Burmese Prime Minister U Nu has also made important contributions to the cause of peace. Now, the Five Principles have become the foundation of friendly relations between India, Burma, and other countries, and China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries. The new Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe has stated that Burma will continue to pursue a peaceful foreign policy, which the Chinese people warmly welcome and support.

    Over the past two years, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been increasingly universally recognized not only in Asia but also throughout the world. In their joint statement, the prime ministers of China and India believed that if the Five Principles were applied to general international relations, they would form a solid foundation for peace and security, and fear and doubt would be replaced by a sense of trust. This view of the prime ministers of China and India has now become a common belief among the people and government leaders of many countries in the world.

    As the United States' "policy of strength" has failed worldwide, the international situation is tending to ease, and international relations frozen by a decade of "Cold War" have shown a completely new and active situation. Especially since the Geneva Four-Power Summit, exchanges and visits between people and government leaders of various countries have become increasingly frequent, economic and cultural cooperation between countries has greatly developed, and mutual trust between countries with different social systems has greatly strengthened. All of this is having a major impact on the further easing of the international situation. And in the interactions between countries, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become recognized norms of international relations. For example, in the Soviet-Danish communique issued during the visit of Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen to the Soviet Union in March this year, both sides expressed their full agreement that "relations between countries should be based on non-interference in internal affairs, respect for the sovereignty of all countries, non-aggression, and equal cooperation, which is in line with the basic principles of the United Nations." The Soviet-Swedish communique issued during the visit of Swedish Prime Minister Erlander to the Soviet Union in April this year also unanimously confirmed the same principles.

    It should be pointed out that now even countries like Britain and France are in fact recognizing that the principles of peaceful coexistence are a necessary foundation for establishing good international relations. For example, the statement issued at the end of the meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and France in May this year stated that the leaders of the two countries "expressed their firm conviction that mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, and non-interference in internal affairs are the main foundations for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries." A similar wording was adopted in the statement of the meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and Britain in April this year.

    Now, among the major countries in the world that bear significant responsibility for peace, only the United States still refuses to apply the principles of peaceful coexistence in international relations. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has been inciting suspicion and hatred among countries until recently, advocating arms expansion and war preparation, calling for strengthening aggressive military blocs, and discrediting neutral countries that advocate maintaining their sovereignty and independence. The United States still occupies China's Taiwan, establishes military bases on the territories of many countries, and uses so-called "aid" to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries and interfere in their internal affairs. Although in the increasingly high-pitched calls of people of all countries demanding peaceful coexistence, the United States has had to lower its tone and make some changes in certain aspects of its foreign policy. But the fact is, as many American commentators have pointed out, that this is only a tactical change, and the United States' basic policy of creating tension and preparing for war around the world remains the same.

    This attitude of the United States shows that in order for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to become universally accepted principles in international relations, and to become a powerful weapon for the people of all countries to safeguard peace and their own independence, freedom, and security, peace-loving people of all countries must wage a hard and unremitting struggle against the aggressive forces of the United States. The facts of the past two years have proven that as long as the people of all countries persist in the struggle for peace, the principles of peaceful coexistence will be accepted by more and more countries, and peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems is entirely achievable.

    现代国际关系的基本准则
    两年以前的今天，中印两国总理发表联合声明，确定以互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则，作为指导两国之间关系的原则。接着在第二天，中缅两国总理发表联合声明，肯定了这五项原则。这五项原则的宣布，立即获得了全世界、特别是亚洲人民的热烈赞同和拥护，并且对亚洲局势的发展起了重大的作用。
    两年以来国际形势的发展表明，中印两国和中缅两国总理倡导的和平共处的五项原则，正在越来越有力地表现出自己的生命力，产生日益深远的影响，并且已经成为指导现代国际关系的重要准则。
    中印两国和中缅两国总理首先在世界上倡导和平共处的五项原则，这并不是偶然的。中国、印度和缅甸都是不久以前才从殖民压迫下取得独立的国家。它们长期的共同处境，使它们产生了共同的愿望，这就是维护自己的主权和独立，建设自己的国家。而为了实现这些愿望，就必须要有和平的环境。历史的教训使它们懂得，煽动猜疑和敌视，制造纠纷和战争，这是帝国主义在亚洲实行侵略和分而治之的政策的惯用手段。和平共处五项原则的确立，使得亚洲国家之间建立了真诚友好、互助合作的关系，挫折了帝国主义在亚洲国家之间进行挑拨离间的阴谋，在亚洲建立了广大的和平地区，从而加强了这些国家的独立、安全和发展。
    正因为这样，五项原则在促进亚洲和平和亚洲国家之间的相互了解和信任方面，发生了巨大的影响。在万隆亚非会议上，五项原则得到了引伸和发展。由于亚非国家根据万隆会议的精神，在坚持这些原则的基础上互相交往，各国之间经济上和文化上的交流和合作，两年来已经有了很大的发展。这些原则的精神也大大加强了亚非各国维护自己独立和主权的意志和力量。越来越多的亚非国家在对外关系中采取了独立的和平中立的政策，它们不许外国干涉自己的内政，它们坚决不参加侵略性的军事联盟。亚非的和平地区是越来越扩大了，美国在亚非地区组织侵略集团、制造紧张局势的阴谋遭到了越来越严重的打击。这就大大地改善了亚非地区的局势。
    作为五项原则的倡议人，中印、中缅之间的友谊，两年来得到了不断的加强。中国和其他亚非国家之间的友好合作，在五项原则的基础上，也正在日益发展。印度总理尼赫鲁在扩大五项原则的影响，维护亚洲和世界和平的事业中起了卓越的作用。前缅甸总理吴努也对和平事业作出了重要的贡献。现在，五项原则已经成为印度、缅甸等国和中国、苏联以及其他社会主义国家之间的友好关系的基础。缅甸新总理吴巴瑞已经表示缅甸将继续奉行和平的外交政策，中国人民对此表示衷心的欢迎和支持。
    两年以来，和平共处的五项原则不但在亚洲，而且也在全世界得到了愈来愈普遍的承认。中印两国总理在他们的联合声明中曾经认为，如果五项原则适用于一般国际关系之中，它们将形成和平和安全的坚固基础，而恐惧和疑虑将为信任感所代替。中印两国总理的这个意见，现在已经成为世界上许多国家的人民和政府领袖的共同信念了。
    由于美国的“实力政策”在世界范围内遭到失败，国际局势趋向缓和，被十年“冷战”所冻结的国际关系出现了全新的活跃的局面。特别从日内瓦四国首脑会议以来，各国人民和政府领袖之间的交往和访问日益频繁，各国之间的经济和文化的合作也大为发展，社会制度不同的国家相互间的信任也大大加强了。所有这一切，对国际局势的进一步和缓正在发生着重大的影响。而在各国的交往中间，和平共处的五项原则已经成为公认的国际关系的准则。例如，今年三月间丹麦首相兼外交大臣汉森访问苏联时所发表的苏联—丹麦公报中，就表示双方完全同意，“各国之间的关系应该建立在互不干涉内政、尊重各国主权、互不侵犯和平等合作这样一个符合联合国基本原则的基础之上”。四月间瑞典首相埃兰德访问苏联时所发表的苏联—瑞典公报中，也一致确认了同样的原则。
    应当指出，现在就是像英国、法国这样的国家，也在事实上承认和平共处的原则是建立良好的国际关系的必要基础。例如在今年五月苏法两国领导人会谈结束时所发表的声明说，两国领导人“表示坚信，互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政是各国之间和平共处和友好合作的主要的基础”。在今年四月苏英两国领导人会谈的声明中也采取了类似的措词。
    现在，在世界上对和平负有重大责任的主要国家之中，只有美国还拒绝在国际关系中应用和平共处的原则。美国国务卿杜勒斯直到最近还在煽动各国之间的猜疑和仇视，鼓吹扩军备战，号召加强侵略性的军事集团，诋毁主张维护自己主权和独立的中立国家。美国直到现在还侵占着中国的台湾，在许多国家的领土上建立军事基地，利用所谓“援助”侵犯别国的主权，干涉它们的内政。虽然在各国人民要求和平共处的日益高涨的呼声中，美国在对外政策的某些方面不得不放低调子，作出一些改变的姿态。但是事实正如美国的许多评论员所指出的，这不过是策略上的改变，而美国在全世界制造紧张局势、准备战争的基本政策却依然如故。
    美国的这种态度说明，为了使和平共处的五项原则成为国际关系中被普遍接受的原则，成为各国人民维护和平和自身的独立、自由和安全的有力武器，各国爱好和平的人民还必须同美国的侵略势力进行坚苦不懈的斗争。两年来的事实已经证明，只要各国人民坚持争取和平的斗争，和平共处的原则就将被越来越多的国家所接受，不同制度的国家之间的和平共处是完全可以实现的。
