Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate have each submitted written reports to the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, reporting on the handling of proposals from the Second Session of the First National People's Congress.

In the aforementioned reports, it was stated that relevant departments have seriously studied the proposals, and all those that should be and could be handled have been handled and implemented, or are being gradually implemented.

The reports provided details on the processing of each proposal. For example, regarding the proposal to establish a system for inspections by deputies of the National People's Congress and deputies of provincial (municipal), autonomous prefectural, and county (municipal) people's congresses, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, after research, decided that deputies of the National People's Congress and deputies of provincial-level people's congresses should conduct inspections twice a year. As for deputies of autonomous prefectural and county (municipal) people's congresses, since they can conduct inspections at any time, it was not established as a system, and the report also explained this. Regarding the suggestions in the proposals on continuing to strengthen the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities and safeguarding the socialist construction of the country, the State Council, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate respectively explained the handling situation in their reports. Regarding the proposal to completely eradicate schistosomiasis, in addition to the State Council having instructed the Ministry of Health to handle it, since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call in November 1955 to eliminate schistosomiasis within seven years, relevant provinces and cities have carried out schistosomiasis prevention and control work and have formulated specific tasks for eliminating schistosomiasis. Regarding the proposal to systematically reclaim arable wasteland, the State Council has instructed the Ministry of Agriculture to handle it. This work has been carried out in three ways: reclaiming wasteland by state-owned farms, reclaiming wasteland by immigrants, and mobilizing the masses to reclaim small plots of wasteland nearby. Wasteland surveying and design institutions have been established in sixteen key wasteland provinces (regions), and immigrant reclamation institutions have been established in eight provinces and cities. Regarding the proposal to appropriately renovate Shanghai's iron and steel industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is now planning to further leverage the potential of Shanghai's iron and steel industry based on the principle of fully utilizing the potential of existing enterprises.

There are also a few proposals where the suggestions require long-term consideration, or cannot be implemented immediately due to current limitations. The relevant departments have also provided answers to each of these in the reports.

    全国人民代表大会常委会等向第三次会议提出报告
    说明第二次会议提案办理情形
    新华社28日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会、国务院、最高人民法院和最高人民检察院已经分别提出书面报告，向第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议报告关于第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议提案办理情形。
    在上述各个报告中，都说明有关部门对提案已作了认真研究，凡是应当办理而且可以办理的，都已经办理和实施，或者正在逐步实施。
    报告中对每件提案的处理经过，都作了交代。例如：关于将全国人民代表大会代表及省（市）、州、县（市）人民代表大会代表视察定为制度的提案，全国人民代表大会常务委员会在研究后，决定全国人民代表大会代表和省、自治区、直辖市人民代表大会代表每年视察工作两次。至于州、县（市）人民代表大会代表，由于他们可以随时进行视察，所以没有定为制度，报告中也对此作了说明。对提案中关于继续加强镇压反革命活动、保卫国家社会主义建设的建议，国务院、最高人民法院和最高人民检察院在报告中分别将处理情况作了说明。对提案中关于彻底铲除血吸虫病的建议，除国务院已交卫生部办理外，自从1955年11月中共中央提出了七年内消灭血吸虫病的号召后，有关省市都开展了血吸虫病的防治工作，并且拟订了消灭血吸虫病的具体任务。关于有计划开垦宜耕荒地的提案，国务院已交农业部办理。这个工作已采取国营农场开荒、移民开荒和发动群众就近开垦小片荒地等三种方式进行，并已在十六个荒地重点省（区）成立荒地勘测设计机构，在八个省市成立了移民垦荒机构。关于适当改建上海的钢铁工业的提案，冶金工业部现在正根据充分发挥原有企业潜力的方针，规划进一步发挥上海钢铁工业的潜力。
  还有少数提案中所提出的建议，有的因需从长考虑，有的因限于目前条件还不能立即实行，有关部门对此也都在报告中一一作了答复。
