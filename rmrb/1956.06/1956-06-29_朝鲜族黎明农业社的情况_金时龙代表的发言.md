I have listened to Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee" on behalf of the Standing Committee, and I express my complete agreement and heartfelt support.

Now, I will give a brief report to the delegates on the production development of our Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, this year, as well as the twelve-year production long-term plan.

Our Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative was organized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, especially under the glorious light of Chairman Mao's nationality policy, on the basis of voluntariness and mutual benefit. The mutual aid group, which began to be formed in 1947, had only 4 households. In 1951, it developed to 21 households, and a semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative was also formed. By 1953, it had developed to 48 households, and in 1954, it further developed to 185 households, at which point it had become a fully socialist advanced agricultural production cooperative.

Since Chairman Mao's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" were conveyed to the countryside, they greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all farmers to take the path of cooperation. Many farmers requested to join the agricultural production cooperative. Therefore, on the basis of our original cooperative, we expanded by 8 villages, 45 cooperatives, and a part of mutual aid groups. Now, the total number of households in our cooperative has expanded from the original 185 to 1,767, with a total of 8,896 people, including 3,784 laborers. The cultivated land area is 3,300 hectares, including 1,200 hectares of paddy fields and 2,100 hectares of dry land. There are 1,100 head of livestock. However, in the process of expanding the cooperative, we also encountered many difficulties. For example, some farmers were afraid that after joining the cooperative, it would be difficult to manage due to the large number of people and the size of the cooperative; some sold their livestock before joining the cooperative; some old cooperative members were concerned about whether their income would decrease after the expansion; after the expansion, a large number of livestock were concentrated, and due to lack of experience, the feeding and management were not good, and the livestock once became thin, which affected the labor mood of some cooperative members. After the leadership discovered these problems, they promptly conducted ideological education, implemented the "four fixings" and graded quotas in labor organization, and gradually dispelled the ideological concerns of the masses and stabilized the production mood through the education of the 12-year long-term plan.

With the arrival of the high tide of cooperation, a high tide of production also appeared. In order to ensure the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan, produce more grain, and increase the income of cooperative members, I will now talk about our 1956 production plan: the average yield per hectare of paddy fields is required to reach 8,500 jin, the average yield per hectare of dry land is required to reach 2,500 jin (most of which is mountainous land), and the average yield per hectare of paddy and dry land is 4,682 jin. The planned total output for the year is 15,450,000 jin. After deducting 30% for agricultural tax, tractor cultivation fees, public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and other production costs, the remaining 70% will be distributed to cooperative members as dividends. If calculated based on the 3,784 male and female laborers in the entire cooperative, with an average of 200 workdays per laborer, each workday can be divided by about 2 yuan, and each laborer can receive about 400 yuan per year, which can greatly improve the living standards of farmers.

According to the national and provincial agricultural development plan from 1956 to 1967, and in combination with the specific situation of our cooperative, after discussion by all cooperative members, a twelve-year production plan has also been formulated. By 1967, our cooperative requires the average yield per hectare of paddy fields to reach 14,000 jin, the average yield per hectare of dry land to reach 4,000 jin, and the average yield per hectare of paddy and dry land to reach 11,500 jin. In order to achieve this plan, we have formulated several specific measures to increase production:

	First, on the basis of the existing 1,200 hectares of paddy fields, the area of paddy fields will be increased year by year. By 1967, the paddy fields should reach 2,500 hectares. In order to expand the paddy fields, it is necessary to build water conservancy projects. It is planned to build a small reservoir and small-scale water conservancy facilities to solve the source of water.

	Second, in order to prevent floods and droughts and prevent soil erosion, it is planned to convert the mountainous land around the cooperative into terraces, and at the same time strengthen the work of planting trees and afforestation.

	Third, this year, the area cultivated by tractors in our cooperative has reached 20% of the total area. It is planned that by 1967, the area cultivated by tractors will reach 75% of the total area. This will greatly improve the quality of cultivation, reduce the physical labor of cooperative members, and increase grain production.

	Fourth, in solving the problem of fertilizer, in addition to the chemical fertilizer supplied by the state, we must carry out a year-round manure accumulation campaign, apply a large amount of green manure, and use peat composting methods to actively develop fertilizer sources to solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer.

	Fifth, in order to increase the income of cooperative members, combine agricultural production and appropriately organize sideline production:
		1. Our cooperative currently has 200 hectares of fruit trees, and plans to expand to 500 hectares by 1967. In addition to labor costs and pesticide costs, the annual income can be 600,000 yuan.
		2. Actively protect livestock and develop animal husbandry in a planned way. Our cooperative has 1,100 head of cattle, of which 550 are cows. This year, it is planned to breed 500 calves. 270 have already been bred this year. Starting in 1961, 1,500 head of cattle can be sold to the state every year. This not only supplies the needs of the state, but also increases the income of cooperative members.
		3. Develop sideline production such as raising pigs, raising fish, raising chickens, and raising ducks in a planned way.

	The total income from sideline production can reach 19.5 million yuan by 1967 (excluding household sideline production). The average annual income per household from sideline production and agricultural production can reach 2,800 yuan to 3,000 yuan.

	Sixth, in terms of culture and education, there are currently 7 primary schools and 1 middle school in our cooperative. This year, the cooperative will bear 35% of the expenses of the primary schools, and next year it can bear more. Through spare-time cultural learning, the current cultural level of cooperative members has reached the level of junior primary school, senior primary school, and junior high school respectively. It is planned that by 1967, 50% of cooperative members will improve their cultural level to the equivalent of middle school level.

The twelve-year production long-term plan points out a clear struggle goal for our farmers. However, there must be many difficulties in the process of advancement, and the state needs to give help and support. We have full confidence in overcoming all difficulties and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strive to complete and overfulfill the national First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and to realize a happier socialist society as soon as possible!

    朝鲜族黎明农业社的情况
    ——金时龙代表的发言
    我听了李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，农业部廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”和彭真副委员长代表常务委员会所作的“常务委员会工作报告”以后，表示完全同意并衷心的拥护。
    现在我把我们延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县黎明农业生产合作社今年生产发展情况，以及十二年的生产远景规划，向各位代表作一个简单的汇报。
    我们黎明农业生产合作社是在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，特别是在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，在自愿和互利的基础上组织起来的。1947年开始组成的互助组仅有4户，1951年发展到21户，同时组成了半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。到1953年发展到48户，1954年又发展到185户，这时已成为完全社会主义性质的高级农业生产合作社了。
    自从毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示传达到农村以后，大大地鼓舞了全体农民走合作化道路的积极性，很多农民要求加入农业生产合作社，因此在我们原有社的基础上扩大了8个村、45个社和一部分互助组。现在我们社的总户数已由原来的185户扩大到1，767户，共有8，896口人，其中有3，784个劳动力。耕地面积3，300垧，其中水田1，200垧，旱田2，100垧，牲畜1，100头。但是在扩社过程中也遇到了很多困难，如有一部分农民怕入社后人多社大管理不好；有的在入社前卖掉了牲畜；也有部分老社员顾虑到扩社后会不会减少收入；扩社后，牲畜大量集中，由于缺乏经验，饲养管理得不好，曾一度发生牲畜瘦弱的现象，因而影响了一部分社员的劳动情绪。领导上发现了这些问题以后，及时地进行了思想教育，在劳动组织上实行了四固定和分级定额的办法，通过12年远景规划的教育，逐步地打消了群众的思想顾虑，稳定了生产情绪。
    随着合作化高潮的到来也出现了生产的高潮，为了保证提前完成第一个五年计划，多打粮食，增加社员的收入，下面我谈一谈我们1956年的生产计划：水田平均每垧产量要求达到8，500斤，旱田平均每垧产量要求达到2，500斤（其中大部是山地），水旱田平均每垧产量为4，682斤。计划全年总产量为15，450，000斤，除去用30％作为上缴农业税、拖拉机代耕费、公积金、公益金以及其他生产费用外，其余70％作为社员分红。如以全社男女3，784个劳动力计算，平均每个劳动力作200个劳动日，则每个劳动日可分2元左右，每个劳动力每年即可分得400元左右，这就可以大大地提高农民的生活水平。
    根据国家和我省1956年到1967年农业发展规划，结合我们社的具体情况，经过全体社员的讨论，也制定了一个十二年的生产规划。我们社到1967年水田平均每垧产量要求达到14，000斤，旱田平均每垧产量要求达到4，000斤，水旱田平均每垧产量为11，500斤。为了实现这个计划，我们拟定了几项具体增产措施：
    一、在现有水田1，200垧的基础上，逐年增加水田，到1967年，水田要达到2，500垧。为了扩大水田就必须兴修水利。计划修建一个小型水库和小型水利，以解决水的来源。
    二、为了防止水旱灾害，防止水土流失，计划把社周围的山地改为梯田，同时加强植树造林工作。
    三、今年我们社用拖拉机耕种面积已达到总面积的20％，计划在1967年用拖拉机耕种面积要达到总面积的75％。这样就能大大地提高耕作质量，减轻社员的体力劳动，增加粮食的产量。
    四、在解决肥料方面，除了国家供给的化学肥料以外，要开展常年积肥运动，大量压绿肥，利用草炭堆肥等办法，积极开辟肥源以解决肥料不足的困难。
    五、为了增加社员的收入，结合农业生产，适当地组织副业生产：
    1、我们社现有果树200垧，计划到1967年扩大到500垧，除了劳动费、农药费外，每年可收入60万元。
    2、积极保护牲畜，有计划地发展畜牧业。我们社现有1，100头牛，其中母牛有550头，今年计划繁殖500头小牛，今年已繁殖了270头，从1961年开始，每年可以卖给国家1，500头牛。这样不仅供给国家的需要，而且也增加了社员的收入。
    3、有计划的发展养猪、养鱼、养鸡、养鸭等副业生产。
    总的副业生产收入，到1967年可以达到1，950万元（不包括家庭副业生产），副业生产和农业生产收入，平均每年每户可收入2，800元—3，000元。
    六、文化教育方面，我们社内现有小学7所，中学1所。今年小学的经费由合作社负担35％，明年可以由社多负担些。社员经过业余文化学习，现有文化水平已分别达到了初小、高小、初中的水平，计划到1967年有50％的社员提高到相当于中学程度的文化水平。
    十二年的生产远景规划，它给我们农民指出了明确的奋斗目标，但是，在前进当中一定还有很多困难，须要国家给以帮助和支持，我们有充分的信心克服一切困难，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为提前和超额完成国家第一个五年计划，为早日实现更幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗！
