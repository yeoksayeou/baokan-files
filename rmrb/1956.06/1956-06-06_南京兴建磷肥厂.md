    Nanjing Builds Phosphate Fertilizer Plant
    (By our own correspondent) A modern agricultural fertilizer manufacturing plant of considerable scale in our country – the state-owned Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant – has already commenced construction. On June 1st, the phosphate fertilizer plant held a grand commencement ceremony.
    The factory was originally scheduled to be completed in 1958. In order to meet the urgent need for fertilizer in rural areas, relevant departments have decided to speed up the construction progress. It is expected that the factory will be completed ahead of schedule in the first half of next year, and officially put into production in July.
