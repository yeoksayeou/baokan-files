Xinhua News Agency, Xilinhot, 11th—Ten guests from Qinghai Province have made a week-long trip to the Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. They are Mongolian and Tu representatives from Qinghai Province attending the scientific symposium on Mongolian language family.

　　On the green summer pasture, the guests were warmly received by the herdsmen. The Cejie Animal Husbandry Year-Round Mutual Aid Team, which had achieved a bumper harvest of livestock, held a whole sheep banquet to welcome the Qinghai brothers. The hosts and guests drank fresh mare's milk while discussing the construction of a happy life in the great family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. When parting, Tu representative She Jianwen said to the men and women herdsmen of the mutual aid team: Let us unite and love each other even more, and advance together on the road to socialism.

　　The guests were very interested in the state-owned farms. Here they saw many excellent breeds of livestock cultivated in Inner Mongolia: the Sanhe dairy cows with very high milk production, the agile and fast Akha-Mongolian hybrid horses, and thousands of improved fine-wool sheep. They believe that the rich and beautiful Inner Mongolia grassland is a good base for developing socialist animal husbandry.

　　The construction of the grassland city of Xilinhot attracted the attention of the Qinghai guests. They visited factories, schools, newspapers, weather stations, post and telecommunications bureaus, etc. In the evening, the Xilin Gol League Cultural Troupe performed ethnic songs and dances for them. After the visit, the Tu representative expressed the hope that in the future, in the development of the Tu culture, they would be able to obtain assistance from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

　　In the famous Inner Mongolia temple—Beizi Temple, the representatives saw the lamas leading a free religious life, and the temple also has cultural schools and clinics. The Tu Living Buddha, Ge Xigancang, happily encouraged the lamas who were learning the new Mongolian script to study hard.

    青海客人在内蒙古草原上
    新华社锡林浩特11日电　十位来自青海省的客人，在内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒草原上作了一个星期的旅行。他们是出席蒙古语族语言科学讨论会的青海省蒙古族和土族代表。
    在绿色的夏季牧场上，客人们受到牧民们热情的接待。获得牲畜丰收的策桀畜牧业常年互助组，举行全羊酒宴来欢迎青海兄弟。宾主们一面喝着新鲜的马奶，一面交谈在祖国各民族大家庭里建设幸福生活的情况。临别的时候，土族代表佘建文对互助组男女牧民说：让我们更加团结友爱，共同向社会主义道路前进。
    客人们对国营牧场感到极大兴趣。他们在这里看到了许多内蒙古培育出来的优良畜种：产奶量很高的三河乳牛，矫健善跑的阿哈—蒙古杂种马，几千只经过改良的细毛羊。他们认为富饶而美丽的内蒙古草原，真是发展社会主义畜牧业的良好基地。
    草原城市锡林浩特的建设，引起青海客人的注意。他们参观了工厂、学校、报社、气象台、邮电局等。晚间，锡林郭勒盟文化队为他们演出了民族歌舞。土族的代表在参观以后，表示今后在发展土族文化工作中，希望能够取得内蒙古自治区的帮助。
    在内蒙古著名的寺院——贝子庙里，代表们看到喇嘛们过着自由的宗教生活，庙内还设有文化学校和医务所。土族活佛?西尕藏高兴地勉励正在学习新蒙文的喇嘛们好好学习。
