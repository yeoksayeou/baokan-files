    I would like to share my personal opinions on the issues of the state's final accounts and budget, and how our industrial and commercial circles should accept transformation and play a role after the joint state-private ownership of enterprises.
    From the first part of Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget, we see that thanks to the efforts of all parties, our country has successfully achieved the task of the 1955 state budget. We are even more pleased to see that 1955 was a year of rapid development of socialist transformation. The proportion of various economic components in the total industrial output value has changed greatly, that is, the proportion of industries of a socialist and semi-socialist nature has soared, and the proportion of private industries has rapidly declined. The report also clearly pointed out that there were some shortcomings in the implementation of the 1955 budget plan. For example, the production of some industrial enterprises blindly pursued output and output value, resulting in a decline in the quality of many products and the formation of stockpiles, which to a certain extent affected the completion of the state budget revenue plan.
    In the second part of the report, we see that in the state's economic construction expenditures for 1956, the proportion of expenditures for light industry and agriculture increased compared to 1955. By appropriately developing light industry and agriculture, on the one hand, better and more products are produced to meet the needs of the broad masses of people, and at the same time, funds are more effectively accumulated for the development of heavy industry; on the other hand, more raw materials are provided for industrial production, and a larger market is opened up for industrial products. This appropriately arranges the relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture, which is completely correct. The 1956 state budget also appropriately increased transportation expenditures, and developing the transportation industry also meets the needs of the development of industrial and agricultural production. In order to strengthen the initiative and enthusiasm of local financial work, the report also put forward practical and feasible methods, which is precisely a step towards correctly resolving the relationship between the central government and local governments.
    The 1956 state budget is a budget to accelerate the construction of socialism, and a budget to strive for the early and overfulfillment of the first five-year plan. I fully agree with the report made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian.
    What makes us feel most excited is that by the end of 1956, the proportion of private industry in the total industrial output value has decreased from 16% at the end of 1955 to an insignificant 0.4%, and the proportion of private commerce has also been greatly reduced. This powerfully illustrates that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce has achieved a great victory. The days when we in the industrial and commercial circles happily enter socialist society, give up exploitation, and become self-reliant laborers are getting closer and closer.
    Vice Premier Li mentioned in his report that the government cares about the lives of private industrialists and businessmen, and Vice Premier Chen Yun proposed in his speech at the conference that the fixed interest rate of joint state-private enterprises can be uniformly set at 5% per annum, and put forward several specific solutions to the wage and welfare issues of private personnel in joint state-private enterprises. At present, most of the private industrialists and businessmen are already serving in enterprises in different forms, and those who have not been properly placed or whose treatment is not reasonable enough will continue to be resolved. Such care and consideration from the government is playing a huge role in encouraging us in the industrial and commercial circles. Let us examine ourselves. After the joint state-private ownership of enterprises, has our enthusiasm for production and management been fully exerted? How is our subjective effort in accepting transformation? Obviously, it is far from enough. In the future, we should redouble our efforts in the following three aspects:
    First, contribute technical talents to do a good job in production. In January of this year, we enthusiastically joined the upsurge of private industry and commerce further accepting socialist transformation. The transformation of enterprises is for the development and improvement of production. We in the industrial and commercial circles have certain business experience, production skills, and work abilities in the production and management of enterprises. Our work in the enterprises has been arranged. To be a well-deserved enterprise cadre who gradually establishes a comradely relationship with the working class, to live up to the country's trust in us, and to become a useful person in the enterprise, we should work with the public representatives and the masses of workers to actively do a good job in the production and management of the enterprise. Recently, industrial and commercial circles across the country have enthusiastically participated in socialist competitions and advanced producer movements, and many people have been rewarded, which is worthy of praise. It should be recognized that our management experience should be critically applied. That is, those parts that are not suitable for socialist enterprises or semi-socialist enterprises should be negated, and we should contribute as much as possible to those that can play a positive role in socialist enterprises, and constantly seek progress and improvement by learning new knowledge of socialist management, so that we can play a greater role in our work. After the joint ownership of enterprises, we should be more active than before and do our work better. All those passive, dependent, and waiting thoughts of the past are unacceptable.
    Second, strengthen ideological transformation. The country's socialist transformation cause is developing rapidly. It should be admitted that ideological transformation is the key issue of socialist transformation. We are lagging behind the development of the situation in terms of ideological transformation. We are not good at using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. We have not put in enough effort in overcoming individualistic thoughts. We are worried about gains and losses, sometimes feeling inferior, sometimes feeling arrogant. There are many buckets that need to be removed. When the old buckets are gone, new buckets will come up again. Problems constantly arise in our thinking. Only by making self-efforts to accept help and constantly overcoming them can our ideological understanding gradually improve. It is good for ideological transformation if we seriously examine ourselves more often and admit our shortcomings. Combine our work practice in the enterprise, strengthen our study, break capitalist thoughts, establish socialist thoughts, and gradually shorten the ideological distance between ourselves and the working class. This will lay a good foundation for transforming ourselves into self-reliant laborers and gloriously joining the ranks of the working class.
    Third, sincerely accept the leadership of socialist components and correct our understanding of the relationship between public and private. After the joint ownership of enterprises, it is natural that private personnel and public personnel are not yet accustomed to working together for the first time, and the staff and workers are bound to have some dissatisfaction with our private personnel's past events. Therefore, there are some problems between the public and private sectors. Some private personnel have concerns and are unwilling to speak up in person, and there are knots in their hearts. Some people are timid and shrink back, which is unnecessary. Only by establishing the idea of sincerely accepting the leadership of socialist components, and being open and honest with the public representatives and the masses of staff and workers, and taking the initiative to make appropriate self-criticism if we have shortcomings, can we clarify right and wrong and eliminate misunderstandings. If we have opinions and requirements in work, life, and study, we can reflect them in a timely manner and seek solutions. And in the enterprise, we should be conscientious in our duties, work actively, and study hard. With these positive performances, we can change the workers' perception of ourselves, and we can better obtain help and education from the public representatives. At the same time, we also hope that the public personnel will give more comradely care to the private personnel and continuously strengthen leadership in ideology and work. I believe that through such continuous joint efforts, the relationship between public and private will gradually improve.
    The above three aspects are interrelated. In the coming period, we must also do our best to assist the government in gradually doing a good job in the reorganization and reform of enterprises, production arrangements, and personnel arrangements. We should unswervingly implement them. As the core members of the industrial and commercial circles, we should not only do this ourselves, but also encourage more people to do the same. The country's socialist cause has a bright future, and every positive factor needs to contribute its strength and play its due role in this cause. Let us mobilize the industrial and commercial circles to work together with the country's workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other patriotic people to strive to fulfill the tasks of the 1956 state budget and to complete the tasks of the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill them.

### 工商界应该怎样接受改造和发挥作用

    工商界应该怎样接受改造和发挥作用
    ——盛丕华代表的发言
    我现在对于国家的决算、预算问题，和我们工商界在企业合营后应该怎样接受改造发挥作用的问题，谈谈个人的意见。
    从李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告第一部分，我们看到由于各方面的努力，我们的国家已经胜利地实现了1955年国家预算的任务；我们更高兴地看到1955年是社会主义改造迅速发展的一年，各种经济成份，在工业总产值中所占的比重变化很大，就是社会主义性质和半社会主义性质的工业比重飞跃上升，私营工业的比重迅速下降，报告中又清楚地指出，在执行1955年预算计划中也有一些缺点，例如部分工业企业部门的生产，片面地追求产量和产值，以至许多产品质量下降，有些产品形成积压，这在一定程度上影响了国家预算收入计划的完成。
    报告第二部分，我们看到1956年国家在经济建设支出中，对于轻工业和农业的支出所占比例比1955年增大了，通过适当地发展轻工业和农业，一方面生产更好更多的产品，供应广大人民的需要，同时更有效地为发展重工业积累资金；另一方面为工业生产提供更多的原料，为工业产品开辟更大的市场，这样就适当地安排了关于重工业、轻工业和农业的配合关系，这是完全正确的。1956年的国家预算，还适当地增加了交通运输支出，发展交通运输事业，也是符合工农业生产发展的需要的。为了加强地方财政工作的主动性和积极性，报告也提出了切实可行的办法，这正是正确地解决中央与地方之间的关系的一个步骤。
    1956年的国家预算是加紧建设社会主义的预算，是争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的预算，我对于李先念副总理所作的报告表示完全同意。
    最使我们感觉兴奋的是到1956年底，私营工业在工业总产值中所占的比重，从1955年底的16％降低到微不足道的0.4％，私营商业的比重也大大地降低，这就有力地说明私营工商业的社会主义改造工作，已经取得伟大的胜利。我们工商界在愉快地进入社会主义社会后，放弃剥削，成为自食其力的劳动者的日子，是越来越接近了。
    李副总理在报告中提到政府关心私营工商业者生活，陈云副总理在大会发言中提出了公私合营企业的定息息率可以统一规定为年息五厘，并对公私合营企业私方人员的工资福利问题，提出了若干具体的处理办法。目前私营工商业者的大部分人已经在不同形式的企业中服务，还没有作适当安置的或者待遇上不够合理的，也都将继续加以解决，政府这样的关怀与照顾，这对于我们工商界是起着十分巨大的鼓舞作用的。我们自己检查一下在企业公私合营以后，我们的生产经营积极性是不是充分发挥了呢？我们在接受改造方面主观努力怎么样呢？显然是很不够的，今后我们应当从以下三个方面来加倍努力：
    第一、贡献技术才能搞好生产。今年一月我们敲锣打鼓地投入私营工商业进一步接受社会主义改造的高潮，企业改造为的是生产的发展和提高，我们工商界在企业的生产经营方面，是有一定的业务经验、生产技能和工作能力的。我们在企业里的工作得到了安排，要做一个名符其实的与工人阶级逐步建立同志式的关系的企业干部，不辜负国家对我们的信任，成为企业里有用的人，就应当和公方代表、工人群众一道积极地搞好企业的生产经营。最近全国各地工商界热烈参加社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动，不少人得到奖励，这是值得加以赞许的。应该认识我们的经营管理经验，要批判地加以运用。就是那些不适合于社会主义企业或者半社会主义企业的部分，应该加以否定，对社会主义企业能够发挥积极作用的，我们应该尽量地贡献出来，并通过学习社会主义经营管理的新知识，不断地求得进步和提高，这样就能在工作中发挥更大的作用。企业合营以后，我们应当比以前更积极些，把工作做得更好些，所有过去那些消极、依赖、等待等思想都是要不得的。
    第二、加强思想改造。国家的社会主义改造事业飞速地向前发展，应当承认思想改造是社会主义改造的关键问题。我们在思想改造方面，是落后于形势的发展的，我们还不善于运用批评和自我批评的武器，我们在克服个人主义思想方面下的功夫是很不深，患得患失，时而自卑，时而自高自大，有不少的吊桶需要拿掉，旧的吊桶去了，新的吊桶又要上来，思想上不断地发生问题，只有自我努力接受帮助，不断地加以克服，思想认识才能逐步提高。我们多多地认真检查自己，并且承认自己的缺点，对于思想改造是有好处的。结合在企业里的工作实践，加强学习，破资本主义的思想，立社会主义的思想，逐步地缩短自己和工人阶级之间的思想距离，这就为把自己改造成为一个自食其力的劳动者，光荣地进入工人阶级的队伍打好基础。
    第三、真诚接受社会主义成份的领导，端正对于公私关系的认识。企业合营以后，私方人员和公方人员初初在一起办事，尚未习惯，职工群众对于我们私方人员过去的旧事，难免还有不满意的地方，因而在公私之间，存在一些问题，这是很自然的，有些私方人员怀有顾虑，当面不肯讲，心里有疙瘩，有些人畏首畏尾，缩手缩脚，都是不必要的，只有建立了真诚接受社会主义成分领导的思想，和公方代表、职工群众开诚相见，自己有缺点，就主动地恰当地进行自我批评。对公方代表或职工群众有意见，就无保留地讲出来，这样就能够弄清是非，消除隔阂。在工作上、生活上、学习上有意见和要求，可以及时地反映出来，求得解决。并且在企业里做到守职尽责，积极工作，努力学习，有了这些积极表现，就能够改变工人群众对自己的看法，就能够从公方代表方面更好地获得帮助和教育。同时，我们也希望公方人员多多地给予私方人员以同志式的关怀，不断地在思想上、工作上加强领导，我相信经过这样不断的共同努力，公私关系是会逐步改善的。
    以上三个方面是相互联系着的，在今后一个时期内，我们还须尽力协助政府，逐步把企业的改组改革、生产安排、人事安排这一系列的工作做好，我们应该坚持不懈地贯彻下去。作为工商界的核心分子，不仅自己应这样做，还要带动更多的人也要这样做，国家的社会主义事业前程远大，需要每一个积极因素在这个事业中贡献自己的力量，发挥应有的作用。让我们工商界动员起来，与全国工人农民知识分子和其他爱国人士一道，为实现1956年的国家预算的任务与提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的任务而奋斗。
