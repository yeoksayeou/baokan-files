Traditional Chinese Medicine Cures Tetanus with 97% Effectiveness

The affiliated hospital of Shanxi Medical College, Linfen People's Hospital of Shanxi Province, and Yongji Health Center of Shanxi Province studied and applied the experience of traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Shi Chuan'en in treating tetanus, achieving a cure rate of 97%.

The traditional Chinese medicine for treating tetanus is a secret recipe passed down for eight generations in the family of Shi Chuan'en, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Yongji County, Shanxi Province. The main prescription consists of more than 20 Chinese medicinal ingredients such as cicada slough, scorpion tail, angelica, *triangle general* (三角将军), and cinnabar, costing only six or seven yuan. In the treatment, moxibustion and cupping are also used as auxiliary methods.

In the past, Shi Chuan'en was very confident in treating tetanus, but lacked methods for patients with combined pneumonia. Now, after Western medical study and research, penicillin has solved this difficulty, and many improvements have been made in nursing care. (Ni Heyi)

    中医中药治破伤风疗效达97％
    山西医学院附属医院、山西省临汾人民医院、山西省永济卫生院学习和运用中医史传恩治疗破伤风的经验治疗破伤风，治愈率达到97％。
    治疗破伤风的中药，是山西省永济县中医史传恩公开的家传八世秘方，主治方剂是由蝉退、全虫尾、独活、三角将军、朱砂等二十多味中药配成，药价只须六、七元。在治疗中还用艾灸、拔火罐等方法作为辅助。
    过去，史传恩治疗破伤风极有把握，只是对合并肺炎的病人缺少办法；现在，经过西医的学习和研究，用青霉素解决了这个困难，并且在护理方面作到了许多改进。　（倪合一）
