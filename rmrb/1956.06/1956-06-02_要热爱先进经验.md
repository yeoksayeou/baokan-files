To Cherish Advanced Experiences
Wang Pu

The May 8th issue of the Shanxi Daily contained an article about an interesting event.

One day in April, Pang Dingchang, an engineer from the open-hearth steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, visited Yi Bin, the deputy director of the Tianjin Steel Plant. The purpose of the visit was to learn about rapid steelmaking and experiences related to improving the production capacity of open-hearth furnaces, as the Tianjin Steel Plant was very advanced in this regard. During the visit, there was the following dialogue:

Pang: "What experiences do you have in production?"
Yi: "Mainly, we focus on daily scheduling meetings."
Pang: "How do you conduct them, and what problems do you solve?"
Yi replied with a smile: "Don't be modest, we learned this experience from your factory in 1954."

Engineer Pang was very surprised to hear this! He also heard that the time Tianjin Steel Plant spent on overhauling open-hearth furnaces was four or five hours less than that of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant for each overhaul. He felt that he should learn from this and asked Yi Bin about the experience in this area. Yi Bin took out a work summary from his drawer and told Engineer Pang: "It is written very clearly above that it was also achieved by learning from the advanced experience of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's open-hearth steelmaking department in exploding steel slag." Engineer Pang felt ashamed and excited upon hearing this, and asked himself: Why didn't our factory make good use of the experience it created, but it was treated as a treasure by a brother factory!

Yes, the problem lies in the fact that the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant did not treat advanced experience as a treasure in the past. This includes not only Engineer Pang, but also the factory director, the Party committee secretary, and the chairman of the trade union. And this phenomenon is not unique to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. Many enterprises also have this merciless and unrighteous problem with advanced experience. As soon as an advanced experience emerges, it is posted on blackboards, celebrated in meetings, advanced producers are selected, awards are given, pamphlets are compiled, articles are written for newspapers, and reports are submitted to higher-level authorities... However, little attention is paid to comprehensively summarizing advanced experience, universally promoting advanced experience, consolidating and developing advanced experience in production, and comprehensively improving production levels by solving new imbalances. Why? Because the "publicity" work mentioned above is extremely easy to do, while the latter work is more meticulous and arduous. As a result, advanced experience flies away and finds a master who can reuse it elsewhere. Another reason is that enterprises that attach importance to the promotion of advanced experience have progressed, while enterprises that create advanced experience have lagged behind, and only think of advanced experience when they fail to complete production tasks. Bureaucracy in leading the advanced producer movement is one example of this.

Advanced experience is the most valuable wealth of the country. Since the conclusion of the National Conference of Advanced Producers, a surge in learning and promoting advanced experience has risen across the country, which is an important condition for carrying out the advanced producer movement in depth. All leading workers and engineering technicians of enterprises should let all advanced experience suitable for their enterprise's production take root, blossom, bear fruit, and flourish, and be evergreen forever! In this way, our production and construction will increase by not just a few tenths of a percent, but by tens or hundreds of percent.

    要热爱先进经验
    王朴
    五月八日的山西日报上，有篇文章谈到一件有趣的事。
    四月里的一天，太原钢铁厂平炉炼钢部工程师庞定昌，访问了天津钢厂副厂长易彬。访问的目的，是想学习快速炼钢和有关提高平炉生产能力的经验；因为天津钢厂在这方面很先进。在访问过程中，有这样一段对话：
    庞：“你们生产上有些什么经验？”
    易：“主要是抓日调度会议。”
    庞：“你们怎样开法，解决些什么问题？”
    易笑着答道：“不要客气了，这个经验是1954年从你们厂里学来的。”
    庞工程师听了大吃一惊！他又听说天津钢厂大修平炉的时间，一次比太原钢铁厂的大修时间少四、五个钟头，觉得应该学一学，又问易彬这方面的经验，易彬从抽屉里拿出一份工作总结，告诉庞工程师说：“上面写的很清楚，也是由于学习了太原钢铁厂平炉炼钢部爆炸钢渣的先进经验后取得的。”庞工程师听了，又惭愧、又激动，自问：为什么本厂创造的经验自己没有很好地运用，却被兄弟厂当成了宝贝呢！
    是的，问题就在于太原钢铁厂过去没有把先进经验当成宝贝，这不仅是庞工程师，也包括厂长、党委书记、工会主席在内；而这种现象并不是太原钢铁厂所独有的，在不少的企业里也有这种对先进经验无情无义的毛病。一项先进经验刚一出来，登黑板报、开庆祝会、选先进生产者、发奖、编小册子、给报纸写稿、向上级机关打报告……但是，很少注意全面地总结先进经验、普遍地推广先进经验、在生产中巩固和发展先进经验、通过解决新的不平衡，全面提高生产水平。为什么呢？因为前面那些“宣传”工作是极容易做的，后面的这些工作比较细致、艰苦。结果是先进经验飞走了，在外面找到了能重用它的主人。另一个原因是重视推广先进经验的企业进步了，创造了先进经验的企业却落后了，在完不成生产任务的时候才对先进经验寄以思念之情。在领导先进生产者运动中的官僚主义，这就是一种。
    先进经验是国家最宝贵的财富。全国先进生产者代表会议闭幕以后，学习和推广先进经验的热潮已经在全国各地高涨起来，这是深入开展先进生产者运动的重要条件。一切企业的领导工作人员、工程技术人员都应该让所有适于自己企业生产情况的先进经验生根、开花、结果、枝叶茂盛，永远常青！这样，我们的生产和建设就不止是提高百分之零点几，而是百分之几十、几百。
