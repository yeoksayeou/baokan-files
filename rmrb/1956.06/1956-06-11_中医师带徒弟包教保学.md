Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to recent statistics, over fifty traditional Chinese medicine doctors in Wuhan have signed contracts with their students guaranteeing instruction and learning. They promise to impart their medical knowledge to their students within two to three years.

Old traditional Chinese medicine doctor Liu Zian has accumulated rich experience in acupuncture treatment. He recently voluntarily took on two students, patiently explaining to them the principles of general traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture techniques every day. The seventy-six-year-old doctor Liu Gongsheng has also recently enthusiastically accepted a high school graduate as his student. He plans to pass on his decades of accumulated experience to his student within three years. Xie Huikang, a famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor in Wuhan, although busy with his work, still takes time every day to lecture his students.
