　　Dulles' "Checks" and Other Matters
　　Jin Feng

　　"We can't give foreign aid like a generous grandfather giving Christmas gifts to his grandchildren, giving some checks to his happy grandchildren, and giving the largest check to his favorite grandson." This was a statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles at a press conference regarding the fact that U.S. aid to the Philippines was not satisfying the country. Here, the U.S. Secretary of State utterly lacks basic politeness, blatantly trampling on the dignity of another country at will, and such extreme rudeness cannot but be astonishing.

　　Naturally, anyone with a little national self-esteem finds it difficult to tolerate this insult. The Philippine "Manila Chronicle" published an editorial on this matter, saying: "If the United States believes that it cannot give the Philippines aid without getting something in return, then our leaders must abandon this aid. They have no right to tolerate U.S. officials infringing on Philippine sovereignty simply because, in the completely unnecessary words of Secretary of State Dulles, the Philippines is America's favorite grandson."

　　The matter doesn't stop there. The so-called "aid" from the United States to the Philippines has not brought the Philippines any benefits whatsoever. Recently, the Philippine House of Representatives instructed the Chairman of the Economic Planning Commission, Congressman Jose Roy, to study the implementation of the economic agreement signed between the United States and the Philippines in 1950. Roy has submitted a very unpleasant report of the findings to the House of Representatives. The report lists facts proving that out of approximately US$100 million in "aid" up to January 31, 1956, approximately US$85 million (i.e., 85% of the total aid) flowed back to the United States because of the requirement to purchase American goods. The cost of supporting American technical personnel ate up more than US$14 million, or about 14.85% of the total funds. Then, isn't the remaining less than 1% of "aid" a mockery of the Philippines?!

　　More importantly, the United States shamelessly uses this "aid" to demand sovereignty over parts of Philippine territory, such as Olongapo, Palawan, and Capas. Moreover, if the Philippines does not allow the United States to import large quantities of American Virginia tobacco into the Philippines, a country known for its Luzon cigars, to destroy the Philippine tobacco industry that has just been established, it will threaten to reduce the quota of Philippine sugar (almost 100% of which is imported by the United States), the country's main export. It is difficult to imagine more unreasonable behavior in international relations than this. And the recent US$65 million loan granted to the Philippines by the U.S. Export-Import Bank is again attached with the condition that the Philippine side is obligated to "purchase various...machines, equipment, materials, and labor needed only from the United States." This is another example of the domineering United States treating the Philippines as if it were the (American) state of Alabama. Philippine Nationalist Party leader Recto once indignantly said: "Now, any U.S. ambassador to the Philippines can perfectly suitably add the title of Governor-General or High Commissioner at the same time. The president of this republic must prostrate himself and apologize to him personally for some offensive remarks published in the newspapers." He also pointed out painfully: "It is the U.S. Embassy here that unilaterally decides Philippine foreign policy, the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group that decides military policy, and the Foreign Operations Administration that decides economic policy."

　　The situation of some other "friends" of the United States is not much better. For example, in Thailand, since accepting U.S. "aid," rice exports have decreased by 25%, timber exports have decreased by 30%, and tobacco exports have decreased by 50%. "U.S. Aid" to Thailand is also a ridiculous farce. From 1950 to the end of 1953, the United States approved a total of more than US$23 million in economic aid to Thailand, but only about US$15 million was actually paid. However, Thailand spends no less than about US$25 million a year to support American soldiers and experts! The United States has always applied a simple principle to its "friends": "What's yours is mine, and what's mine is still mine." Therefore, it can massively dump rice on foreign markets to seize the traditional market of Thai rice, it can arbitrarily stop purchasing rubber, forcing more than 70% of Thailand's rubber plantations to stop production, and it can further depress tin prices, reducing Thailand's tin production to 50%-60% below pre-war levels. The United States' approach to Pakistan is not much more subtle. Cotton is one of Pakistan's main exports. In 1955, just when Pakistan was finding it difficult to export its own cotton, the United States shipped US$22.24 million worth of American cotton to Pakistan. These are the conditions for the "generous" and "large" "aid" that the United States gives to other countries!

　　However, the "conditions" of the United States do not work everywhere. In Cambodia, its "conditions" were rejected. The famous Cambodian political leader Prince Sihanouk publicly announced that Cambodia would abide by neutrality and would not participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization planned by the United States. The "aid" of the United States could not make it change its mind. This greatly angered the United States. It began to manipulate its diplomatic machinery and launched a blockade against Cambodia. It also announced that it would not "aid" Cambodia with dollars. The United States was confident that these threats would make Cambodia obedient, but unexpectedly, they aroused fierce anti-American movements among the Cambodian people. They marched and demonstrated everywhere to protest foreign blockades and interference, and to support the government's independent and autonomous policies. World public opinion also unanimously condemned this barbaric behavior by the United States. The arrogant masters of the White House apparently did not expect their orders to be thwarted in this country, and they were very embarrassed. So, they began to retreat: the blockade of Cambodia was lifted. The U.S. ambassador to Cambodia personally visited the King and Queen of Cambodia, acknowledging that "Cambodia's foreign policy can only be decided freely and autonomously by the Kingdom's government, without interference from external forces." The ambassador also solemnly assured the King and Queen: "The United States' aid to Cambodia is not attached with any conditions that may harm Cambodia's independence and neutrality." This is truly a superb satirical comedy!

　　Bullying the weak and fearing the strong is the true nature of thugs. When a country allows the United States to dictate its affairs, the United States will more unscrupulously trample others underfoot; but when a country resolutely defends its national independence and sovereignty, the United States has no choice but to submit!

    杜勒斯的“支票”及其他 
    金凤
    “我们给外援不能像慷慨的祖父给孙子圣诞节的礼物一样，给他欢喜的孙儿们一些支票，把数目最大的一张支票给他最心爱的孙子。”这是美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上关于美国给菲律宾的援助不能使这个国家满意的谈话。这里，美国国务卿竟然缺乏起码的礼貌，赤裸裸地将另一个国家的体面随随便便践踏在脚下，这种极端的粗野不能不令人吃惊。
    自然，稍有一点民族自尊心的人都难以容忍这种侮辱。菲律宾“马尼拉纪事报”对这件事发表社论说：“假如美国认为它要是得不到代价就不能够给予菲律宾援助，那末，我们的领导人物就必须弃绝这种援助，他们没有权利仅仅由于，用国务卿杜勒斯的十分没有必要的话来说，菲律宾是美国所偏爱的孙子，就容忍美国官员侵犯菲律宾的主权。”
    事情还不止这样。美国对于菲律宾的所谓“援助”，并没有使菲律宾得到丝毫好处。最近，菲律宾众议院曾经责成经济计划委员会主席、众议员何塞·罗伊研究一下美国和菲律宾在1950年签订的经济协定执行的情况。罗伊已经向众议院提出了研究结果的很不愉快的报告。报告中列举事实证明，在到1956年1月31日为止的约一亿美元“援助”中，约有八千五百万美元（即占全部援助的85％）由于必须购买美国商品而流回到美国去了。美国技术人员的供养费又吃去了全部经费中的一千四百余万美元，即14.85％左右，那末，剩下的不到1％的“援助”，不是对菲律宾的讽刺又是什么呢？！
    更重要的是，美国就凭借着这些“援助”，恬不知耻地要求菲律宾一部分领土乌朗牙坡、巴拿湾和加巴示的主权。而且，如果菲律宾不允许美国向素以吕宋雪茄驰名世界的菲律宾大量输入美国的弗吉尼亚烟草来摧毁菲律宾刚刚建立起来的烟草工业的话，它就要以减少菲律宾主要出口的食糖（几乎100％输入美国的）限额来威胁菲律宾。很难设想在国际关系中有比这更不讲理的行为了。而新近美国进出口银行给予菲律宾六千五百万美元的贷款，又加上附带的条件是，菲律宾方面有义务“只从美国购买各种……所需要的机器、装备、物资和劳务。”这是横行霸道的美国把菲律宾当作（美国的）亚拉巴马州看待的又一个例子。菲律宾国民党领袖雷克托曾经愤慨地说过：“现在，任何美国驻菲大使都可以完全适合地同时加上总督或高级专员的头衔。这个共和国的总统为了报刊上发表一些冒犯性的言论，必须卑躬屈膝地亲自对他道歉。”他又痛心地指出：“独断地决定菲律宾外交政策的是此地的美国大使馆，决定军事政策的是美国军事联合顾问团，而决定经济政策的是援外事务管理署。”
    美国的另外一些“朋友”们，它们的处境也并不更好一些。譬如泰国，自从接受美国“援助”以后，大米出口减少了25％，木材出口减少了30％，烟草出口减少了50％。“美援”对于泰国，同样是一桩哭笑不得的把戏。自从1950年至1953年底，美国批准给泰国的经济援助共计二千三百多万美元，实际支付只有约一千五百万美元。而泰国每年用于供养美国军人和专家的费用却不少于二千五百万美元左右！美国对于它的“朋友”一向是应用这样一条简单的原则：“你的就是我的，我的还是我的。”因此，它可以大规模向国外市场倾销大米来抢夺泰国大米的传统市场，它可以随便停止收购橡胶使泰国70％以上的橡胶园被迫停止生产，它更可以压低锡价使泰国锡的生产降低到战前水平的50％—60％以下。对于巴基斯坦，美国的做法也并不更含蓄一些，棉花是巴基斯坦主要的出口之一。1955年正当巴基斯坦自己的棉花外销感到困难的时候，美国又运入巴基斯坦2，240万美元的美国棉花。这些就是美国给予其他国家“慷慨”“大量”的“援助”的条件！
    但是，美国的“条件”并不是到处都行得通的。在柬埔寨，它的“条件”就被碰回来了。柬埔寨的著名的政治领袖西哈努克亲王公开宣布：柬埔寨要遵守中立，不参加美国策划的东南亚条约。美国的“援助”，也不能使它改变主意。这就大大触怒了美国。它开始拨动了外交机器，发动了对柬埔寨的封锁。并且宣布不以美元“援助”柬埔寨。美国满以为这些威吓会使得柬埔寨听话，不料，反而激起了柬埔寨人民激烈的反美运动。他们到处游行示威抗议外国的封锁、干涉，支持政府的独立自主的政策。世界舆论也一致谴责美国这种横蛮行为。傲慢的白宫主人们显然没有料想到他们的发号施令会在这个国家面前碰壁，他们十分狼狈了。于是，他们开始退却：对柬埔寨的封锁撤除了。美国驻柬埔寨的大使亲自谒见柬埔寨的国王和王后，承认“柬埔寨的外交政策只能由王国政府自由地和自主地来决定，而不受外部势力的干涉”。这位大使还向国王和王后隆重保证：“美国对柬埔寨的援助并不附有任何可能损害柬埔寨的独立和中立的条件。”这真是一幕出色的讽刺喜剧！
    欺软、怕硬，原是流氓本色。当一个国家听任美国摆布的时候，美国就会更加肆无忌惮地将别人践踏在脚下；而当一个国家坚决维护自己的民族独立和主权的时候，美国也就无可奈何！
