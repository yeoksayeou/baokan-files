    Shenyang Five Design Units
    Research and Develop Forty-Six Kinds of Design Conversion Tables
    (Our Shenyang Dispatch) The Northeast Industrial Architecture Design Institute, the Third and Fourth Design Bureaus of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Liaoning Provincial Urban Design Institute, and the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, five design units in Shenyang, recently developed forty-six kinds of design conversion tables based on rationalization proposals from their employees and through various calculation formulas. These conversion tables can help technicians quickly obtain many complex calculation figures during the design process.
    In the past, design personnel often had to spend a lot of time flipping through formulas, calculating, and checking numbers in their work. Now, by simply consulting the precisely calculated conversion tables, they can quickly obtain the required design figures, which is both convenient and accurate. For example, after Zhang Guofeng, a probationary technician at the Liaoning Provincial Urban Design Institute, created a soil bearing capacity conversion table, his work efficiency immediately increased twelvefold, and he ensured that no errors occurred.

    沈阳五个设计单位
    研究出四十六种设计换算表
    本报沈阳讯　东北工业建筑设计院、第一机械工业部第三和第四设计分局、辽宁省城市设计院、沈阳煤矿设计院等五个在沈阳的设计单位，最近根据职工的合理化建议，通过各种计算公式研究出四十六种设计换算表。这些换算表能帮助技术员在设计过程中迅速求得许多复杂的计算数字。
    过去设计人员在工作中，经常要把很多的时间放在翻公式，计算和核对数字上，现在只要一查计算精密的换算表，就可以很快地得出需要的设计数字，既方便又准确。例如辽宁省城市设计院见习技术员张国丰创造土壤耐力换算表以后，工作效率马上提高十二倍，并且保证了不出差错。
