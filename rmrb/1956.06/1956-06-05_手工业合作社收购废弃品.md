    Handicraft Cooperative Acquires Waste Products
    (Our report) To better utilize waste products, Xuanwu District, Beijing, universally launched a door-to-door acquisition of waste products on the 25th. The Waste Products Management Department of the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation acquired more than 7 million kilograms of waste products from June last year to May this year, most of which were put into production as raw materials, and a small part could be used as finished products after repair and processing.
    These waste products are mostly acquired from factories, institutions, schools, and other units. According to the statistics of the Beijing Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Engineering Bureau, more than 20,000 kilograms of waste products can be collected from garbage dumps in the city every day. In order to make good use of this part of the waste products, the Beijing Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Engineering Bureau implemented garbage classification and collection in seven urban areas. The Waste Products Management Department cooperated with this work, carried out the acquisition of waste products, and transferred the waste products collected from the masses to the handicraft production cooperatives for production and processing.
    Utilizing these large quantities of waste products not only saves the country a lot of good raw materials, but also solves the difficulty of the handicraft production cooperatives lacking production raw materials. Various goods produced by many handicraft production cooperatives are all made from purchased waste products and scrap materials. The Red Star Metal Products Production Cooperative used purchased scrap iron to make more than 110,000 iron hoes in the first quarter. The quality was as good as that of products made with new materials, but the price was more than 20% cheaper than new materials, and they were welcomed by the farmers.

    手工业合作社收购废弃品
    本报讯　为了更好地利用废弃品，北京市宣武区二十五日普遍开展挨门挨户收购废弃品的工作。北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社废弃品经理部，从去年六月到今年五月，收购了七百多万公斤废弃品，其中大部分作为原料投入生产，一小部分经过修理和加工就可当作成品使用。
    这些废弃品，大都是从各工厂、机关、学校等单位收购来的。据北京市上下水道工程局的统计，全市每天可从垃圾堆里检出二万多公斤废弃品，为了很好地利用这部分废弃品，北京市上下水道工程局在七个城区实行垃圾分类收集工作，废弃品经理部配合这个工作，开展废弃品的收购工作，把群众的废弃品收购来再转给手工业生产合作社生产加工。
    把这些大量的废弃品利用起来，不仅为国家节省了大量好原料，还解决了手工业生产合作社的生产原料缺少的困难。许多手工业生产合作社生产的各种货品，全部都是利用收购来的废品和废料作原料。红星金属品生产合作社第一季度利用收购来的废铁料作的十一万多把铁铣，质量和用新料制品一样好，价钱却比新料便宜20％以上，受到农民的欢迎。
