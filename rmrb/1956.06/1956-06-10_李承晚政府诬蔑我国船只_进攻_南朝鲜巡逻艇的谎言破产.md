Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. According to a United Press International report from Seoul: The Lee Seung-man government has arrested its Coast Guard Commander, Kim Ok-kyung (transliteration), on the 8th, because his lie fabricated at the end of last year that Chinese armed ships attacked South Korean patrol boats has been exposed.

The fabricated incident was uncovered by an investigation conducted by the South Korean Police Bureau. The Police Bureau said on the 8th that the South Korean Coast Guard's claim about engaging in a "naval battle" with a fleet of armed Chinese ships at sea on December 25th last year was a hoax. It said that the actual situation at the time was as follows:

    A South Korean patrol boat captured a Chinese ship on December 25th last year and towed it away. While the Chinese ship was being towed to a South Korean port, four South Korean Coast Guard personnel boarded the ship. However, the Chinese crew subdued them and cut the towline, then fled with the ship.

The South Korean Police Bureau said that, in order to save face, Coast Guard Commander Kim Ok-kyung ordered the patrol boat commander to fire a burst of machine-gun fire at his own ship, and then reported to Seoul that four Coast Guard personnel were missing in a firefight with a Chinese fleet.

At that time, the Lee Seung-man government immediately seized on Kim Ok-kyung's false report, issuing a communique smearing China for "again taking open aggressive action against South Korea." The communique alarmingly stated that "the existence of Korea and free Asia itself is in danger." The Lee Seung-man government also demanded that its "allies take strong and successful countermeasures together with us."

Subsequently, on April 23rd of this year, the patrol boat ran aground and sank near Jeju Island. The sinking of the patrol boat triggered a police investigation, which in turn exposed Kim Ok-kyung's hoax.

The exposure of this hoax has greatly embarrassed the Lee Seung-man government. Shortly after Kim Ok-kyung submitted his resignation on the afternoon of the 8th, it arrested him on charges of filing false reports and damaging a South Korean Coast Guard ship, making it appear as if it had been attacked.

    李承晚政府诬蔑我国船只“进攻”南朝鲜巡逻艇的谎言破产
    新华社平壤9日电　据合众社汉城消息：李承晚政府已经在八日逮捕了它的海岸警卫队司令金玉京（译音），因为他在去年年底捏造的中国武装船只进攻南朝鲜巡逻艇的谎言已经被揭穿了。
    这个捏造的事件是由于南朝鲜警察局进行的调查而被揭发出来的。警察局八日说，南朝鲜海岸警卫队的关于在去年十二月二十五日同一队武装的中国船只在海上进行“炮战”的说法是一个骗局。它说，当时的实际情况是这样的：
    一艘南朝鲜巡逻艇在去年十二月二十五日把一艘中国船只捕获了，然后把它拖着走。在这艘中国船只被拖往一个南朝鲜港口的时候，南朝鲜海岸警卫队的四名人员登上了这艘船。但是，中国船员降伏了他们，并且把牵引带切断了，随后就跟着船一起逃走。
    南朝鲜警察局说，为了保全面子，海岸警卫队司令金玉京命令这艘巡逻艇艇长向他自己的船只发射了一阵机关枪，然后向汉城报告说，四名海岸警卫队人员在同一支中国船队交火中失踪了。
    当时，李承晚政府立即抓住了金玉京的这个假报告，发表公报诬蔑中国“又一次对韩国采取了公开的侵略行动”。公报危言耸听地说，“朝鲜和自由亚洲本身的存在正处于危险之中”。李承晚政府并且要求它的“盟友们将同我们一起采取强有力的和成功的反击措施”。
    随后在今年四月二十三日这艘巡逻艇在济州岛附近触礁沉没了。这艘巡逻艇的沉没引起了警察局的调查，这次调查进而揭发了金玉京的骗局。
    这个骗局的暴露，使李承晚政府十分难堪。它在金玉京在八日下午提出了辞呈之后不久就逮捕了他，罪名是打假报告和把南朝鲜海岸警卫队的一艘船只破坏了，使它看起来好像遭到过攻击一样。
