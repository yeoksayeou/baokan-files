I wholeheartedly support the reports of Vice Premier Li, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Minister Liao Luyan at this conference with an exceptionally excited mood.

I come from Guizhou. I recently inspected the agricultural production situation in the Duyun Special District of southeastern Guizhou. Now I will make the following speech based on my understanding:

The Duyun area has a total of 11 counties, where ethnic minorities make up the majority of the population. Since the second half of last year, under the correct leadership of party and government at all levels, the people of all ethnic groups have experienced an unprecedented upsurge in agricultural socialist transformation. More than 90% of farmers have joined primary agricultural cooperatives; many counties have also established advanced cooperatives. Through the socialist agricultural cooperativization movement, the political awareness of all ethnic groups has been raised, national unity has been strengthened, the relations of production have been changed, and the great development of agriculture has been promoted, enabling agricultural production to increase and demonstrating the superiority of organized collective management. With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural socialism, a general production upsurge has emerged, giving play to the production enthusiasm and labor passion of cooperative members, and carrying out a vigorous spring plowing production movement. For example, according to the statistics of Duyun County as of April 15, in terms of fertilizer accumulation, the existing fertilizer and the fertilizer applied in the minor season totaled 1,996,207,687 jin, reaching 8,230 jin per mu of land, and some cooperatives have reached 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of land; the production of double-cropping rice and double-cropping corn has been completed according to plan; in terms of spring repair of small-scale farmland water conservancy, the county has completed and is about to complete 841 projects, which can expand the irrigated area by 79,869 mu, accounting for 114% of the annual water conservancy task. After inspection, 85% of these water conservancy projects can guarantee irrigation. Farmers reflect that the results of fertilizer accumulation are much more significant than in any previous year, and this year's water conservancy is equivalent to 10 years of projects in the past. Judging from the spring harvest of wheat and barley in the entire Duyun Special District, a bumper harvest has been generally achieved, with a significant increase. According to statistics as of mid-May from 2,202 agricultural cooperatives in the district, about 80% of barley has been harvested, and it is expected to increase by 65.7% compared to last year; not only has the area been expanded, but the yield per mu has increased by 28.7% compared to last year. About 40% of wheat has been harvested, an increase of 253.2% compared to last year, and the yield per mu has increased by 37.8% compared to last year. The promotion of advanced production technologies has also greatly increased. Through these production movements and the bumper harvest of the minor season, the morale of the members has been consolidated, and a strong confidence in increasing income has been established. Agricultural socialist transformation has greatly changed the rural relations of production and presented an unprecedented new look. Its achievements are huge and primary. However, there are still some problems that must be solved and provided for reference.

    First, in the development of technology, there is still a serious imbalance and roughness. The most prominent is that some composts are not well decomposed, the quantity is large, the quality is low, and the fertilizer preservation work is not done well enough. It is allowed to be exposed to the sun and rain arbitrarily. Some cadres are blindly satisfied with statistical figures and lack in-depth inspection work. In the future, inspection and technical guidance should be strengthened, and various advanced experiences in fertilizer accumulation should be promoted to improve fertilizer quality.

    Second, the quality of water conservancy projects is low, and there is a tendency to pursue quantity over quality. Some small-scale water conservancy projects are still dry ponds after construction. Many have water but have many leaks, and they are still unreliable for guaranteeing irrigation. Personnel casualties occur continuously during construction. The main reasons are that the technical level of technical personnel is not high and the administrative guidance is insufficient. It is hoped that the water conservancy department will hold a meeting to study and improve the technical level, strengthen safety production education, and conduct a general survey of completed projects.

    Third, the waste of manpower and financial resources in some cooperatives is also serious. For example, according to statistics from an advanced cooperative in the period from last winter to this spring, non-productive expenditures averaged 10 yuan and 12 labor days per household. This problem has been checked and is being corrected, but it is still necessary to strengthen the implementation of the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative in the long term to ensure that members increase their income.

    Fourth, in cooperatives jointly formed by multiple ethnic groups, the arrangement of cooperative cadres has not fully taken into account that each ethnic group has its own appropriate leaders. This will affect national unity and strengthen the unity of cooperative members and increase production. For example, the Duyun Qianjin Advanced Agricultural Cooperative is composed of four ethnic groups, and the leadership arrangement is better, which plays a good role in strengthening unity and increasing production. Therefore, arrangements must be made cautiously to strengthen national unity.

### 贵州都匀专区的农业生产情况——陆镇藩代表的发言

    贵州都匀专区的农业生产情况
    ——陆镇藩代表的发言
    我以异常兴奋的心情，拥护本次大会上李副总理、彭真副委员长、廖鲁言部长的报告。
    我是从贵州来的，我最近视察了黔东南部都匀专区的农业生产情况，现在就我所了解的情形作如下的发言：
    都匀地区共11个县，是少数民族占多数的地方，自去年下半年以来，在各级党政的正确领导下，各族人民在农业社会主义改造上，出现了空前未有过的高潮，90％以上的农民都加入了初级农业合作社；不少的县份还建立了高级合作社，通过社会主义农业合作化运动，使各族人民的政治觉悟有了提高，加强了民族团结，改变了生产关系，促进了农业的大发展，使农业生产获得增产，显示了组织起来集体经营的优越性。随着农业社会主义高潮到来以后，普遍出现了生产高潮，发挥了社员的生产积极性和劳动热情，进行着热火朝天的春耕生产运动。如都匀县截至4月15日的统计来看，积肥方面，现有肥料和小季已施的肥料共1，996，207，687斤，每亩土地达8，230斤，并有部分合作社每亩土地已达万斤肥料；双季稻和双季包谷生产已按计划完成；春修小型农田水利方面，该县已完工和即将完工的841处，可扩大灌溉面积79，869亩，占全年水利任务的114％，经检查这些水利85％都可保证灌溉。农民反映：积肥比过去任何一年的成绩都大为显著，今年的水利抵上往年10年的工程。从都匀全专区春收大小麦来看，普遍获得丰收，并有显著的增长。该区2，202个农业社截至5月中旬统计，已收大麦80％左右，预计比去年增产65.7％；不但扩大了面积，而且单位面积每亩产量比去年增产28.7％。小麦已收40％左右，比去年增产253.2％，每亩比去年增产37.8％。在推广先进生产技术上也大有增长。透过这些生产运动和小季的丰收，巩固了社员情绪，树立了增加收入的坚强信心。农业社会主义改造，大大地改变了农村生产关系，出现了空前的新面貌，它的成绩是巨大的主要的。但是，仍然存在着一些必须解决的问题，提供参考。
    一、在技术开展上，仍严重的存在着不平衡与粗糙现象，最突出的是有些堆肥腐烂不好，数量多，质量低，保肥工作也作得不够，任意让日晒雨淋，有的干部又盲目满足于统计数字，缺乏深入检查工作，今后应加强检查和技术指导工作，推广各种积肥先进经验，以提高肥料质量。
    二、兴修水利工程质量低劣、贪多图快，有部分小型水利筑成后，本身仍然是干塘，有不少的虽然有水但漏洞很多，对保证灌溉仍是不可靠。在兴工中不断发生人员伤亡事故，其主要原因是技术人员技术不高和行政指导不够，希望水利部门召开会议来研究培养提高技术水平，加强安全生产教育，对竣工的工程进行普查。
    三、有的合作社里浪费人力、财力也是严重的，如一个高级社在去冬今春时期内的统计，非生产性开支就平均每户社员负担人民币10元又12个劳动日。这个问题已经检查正在纠正，但仍须长期的加强贯彻勤俭办社精神，以保证社员增加收入。
    四、在多民族联合组成的合作社，有的对社干的安排上未全面的照顾到使各个民族都适当有自己的领导人员，这样对于民族团结和加强社员的团结、增加生产都会受到一定的影响。如都匀前进高级农业社由四个民族组成，对领导安排较好，对加强团结、增加生产起到良好作用。因此必须要稳慎地作好安排，以加强民族团结。
