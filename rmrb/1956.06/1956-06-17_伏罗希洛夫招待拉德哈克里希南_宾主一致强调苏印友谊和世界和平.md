Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 16th. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, held a reception in the Grand Kremlin Palace on the evening of June 15 to host Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan, who arrived in Moscow that afternoon.

At the reception, Voroshilov said that the Soviet and Indian countries have had friendly ties for many centuries. The people of India and the Soviet Union have always held deep sympathy for each other. The Soviet people firmly believe that the establishment of a sovereign Indian state has opened up new prospects for friendly relations between the two freedom-loving countries.

The Soviet and Indian countries have a common lofty goal: to consolidate world peace. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to India's efforts to consolidate peace, eliminate aggressive military blocs, and develop peaceful cooperation among countries.

Voroshilov finally raised a toast to the guests and said in Hindi, "Hindi-Roosi, Bhai, Bhai!" ("Indians and Russians are brothers!")

Radhakrishnan then delivered a reply speech, saying that India, like the Soviet Union, is willing to give people all forms of freedom to improve their standards. India and the Soviet Union are heading towards a common goal through different paths—the happiness of mankind, namely happiness in material, cultural and spiritual life.

Radhakrishnan emphasized: "Your and our experience shows that we should oppose all forms of colonialism. I hope that we all strive for progress not only for our own countries, but also for the whole world."

He concluded by proposing a toast to the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and India, and to world peace.

The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government attended the reception. Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union K.P.S. Menon and other foreign envoys to the Soviet Union also attended the reception.

Before attending the reception, Radhakrishnan, accompanied by Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Menon, visited Voroshilov, and they had a cordial and friendly conversation.
