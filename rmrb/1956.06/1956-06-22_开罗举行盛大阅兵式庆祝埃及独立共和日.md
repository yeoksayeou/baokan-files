Detachments representing the armed forces of Jordan, Sudan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Libya, and Yemen participated in the review alongside Egyptian troops.

Students from the Egyptian Military Academy led the procession. Following them were Egyptian infantry units, marine corps units, paratrooper units, National Guard units, and cavalry units. Egyptian motorcycle units, artillery units, tank units, and the air force also participated in the parade.

The parade lasted for three and a half hours.

Outside the square, on the streets, hundreds of thousands of people waved flags and shouted slogans. They celebrated the establishment of the Republic and the end of the British army's occupation of the Suez Canal Zone.

On the same day, the Egyptian Navy also held a review in the port of Alexandria.
