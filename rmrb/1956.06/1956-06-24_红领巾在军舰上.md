Red Scarves on a Warship
By Our Correspondents Ji Yin and Xi Ping

On the morning of the 23rd, the Huangpu River on the Shanghai Bund was filled with song. Three hundred outstanding Young Pioneers from various schools in Shanghai held a warm get-together with Soviet naval uncles on the Soviet cruiser "Dmitri Pozharsky."

The day before, the children, as hosts, had entertained these uncles at the Shanghai Children's Palace. Today, they were invited guests here. The uncles helped the little guests onto the deck one by one and then held a welcoming party on the aft deck, which had been neatly arranged in advance.

The uncles took the little guests to visit the warship. The children held the hands of the naval uncles tightly. These high ladders were not for playing, and in some places, the uncles had to carry them one by one. The little guests wore the uncles' sailor hats and sat on the gun positions, and the uncles helped them to erect the anti-aircraft guns, pointing straight at the sky. The "little navigators" stood on the bridge, holding up large binoculars, looking into the distance. All the equipment on the ship simply fascinated the little guests. The naval uncles on the side also smiled, took out handfuls of candies from Vladivostok from their pockets, and stuffed them into the hands of the little guests, or peeled off the candy wrappers and suddenly stuffed the candies into the mouths of these "little navigators"...

Xu Kexin, a student in the second year of junior high school at Shanghai Fudan Middle School, heard that Soviet naval uncles were coming to Shanghai for a visit. He and several Young Pioneers in the school stayed up all night to make a handbag embroidered with a pattern of Sino-Soviet friendship, preparing to give it to the naval uncles. Yesterday, at the get-together in the Children's Palace, he became friends with a sailor named Nikolai Gogolev. Now they were together again. The uncle specifically took him to the high observation deck and said to him: "Your country is such a beautiful country. When you grow up, you must work hard and defend the motherland." The child looked at the uncle with bright eyes, as if he wanted to engrave the uncle's image in his heart forever.

On the various decks of the cruiser, children were surrounded by adults everywhere. They couldn't hold any more things in their hands, but photos, books, picture albums, pens... were still stuffed over from one hand that couldn't refuse. Today, the Young Pioneers also brought many gifts to entrust to the uncles to take to Moscow and Vladivostok, for the Soviet Young Pioneers. There were Chinese big-headed dolls, Tiananmen Square models, and various Chinese sachets. The Young Pioneers of Sichuan South Road Elementary School in Shanghai presented a delicate stamp album, which contained many valuable stamps issued after the founding of our country. The Eighth Squadron of the Yong'an Detachment of the Shanghai Young Pioneers presented an embroidery of telling the Volunteer Army uncles about their academic achievements.

The song and dance party on the deck began. The uncles played music, sang songs, and even sang "The East is Red" in Chinese, and also performed acrobatics, which made the little guests laugh non-stop. The little guests also performed dances and songs for the uncles. Fu Qifeng, a Young Pioneer from Peace Middle School, performed three magic tricks for the uncles. This fourteen-year-old magician skillfully picked up a small blue pocket and put in three colorful handkerchiefs, but soon changed it into a red flag with "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" written on it, with two giant hands clasped tightly, symbolizing the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. When the red flag fluttered in the sea breeze, everyone on the deck cheered. In order to perform this program today, he and his companions had worked hard to practice it over and over again a few days ago. At the party, she said to an uncle: "When I grow up, I want to be a magician." The uncle said approvingly: "This is a very meaningful profession." Fu Qifeng also entrusted the uncle to take a letter to the famous actor Chitochvili of the National Moscow Circus. The uncle said: "I will definitely bring it to you."

While the party was going on here, the uncles had quickly arranged a sumptuous lunch on the aft deck. Apples, fruit juice, candies, chicken rice, fruit bread... filled the dining table. When the little guests sat down at the table, the adults immediately became the most attentive hosts. This kind of hospitality could not be seen anywhere else. If the guests couldn't cut the chicken with a knife, the "hosts" would help them chop it into pieces. If the guests were sitting too low on the stools, the "hosts" would hold them on their laps to eat. Before the meal was finished, the fruit juice had been poured, and the peeled apples had been placed next to them. During the meal, the band kept playing beautiful music, and the children knew that this was the grand etiquette that the navy had for honored guests. Finally, the uncles brought out a large pile of gifts, one box of chocolate candies for each person, a silk red scarf, and a Young Pioneer badge, all brought from Vladivostok. The children put on new bright red scarves, and everyone's face was filled with a happy flush.

The time for farewell arrived, but both the adults and the children were reluctant to part. The ship's band played a farewell song, and the officers and soldiers stood by the ship's rails, singing and waving their hats. Tears flickered in the eyes of adults and children. The children shouted "Goodbye" and "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" in the Russian they had just learned. The small boat sailed to the north side of the cruiser, and the people on the ship flocked to the north side. Later, the small boat sailed behind the cruiser and headed towards the west bank, and the people on the ship rushed to the west side of the deck together, until the touching "Hurrah" could no longer be heard, and hundreds of hands were still waving there.

    红领巾在军舰上
    本报记者　季音  习平
    二十三日早晨，上海外滩的黄浦江上歌声不绝，三百个系着红领巾的上海各学校的优秀少先队员，在苏联“德米特里·波日阿尔斯基”号巡洋舰上，与苏联海军叔叔举行了一次热情的联欢。
    前一天，孩子们曾经以主人的身份，在上海少年宫里招待了这些叔叔们，今天他们则是被邀请到这里来的客人。叔叔们扶着小客人一个个登上了甲板，接着就在早已布置得很整洁的后甲板上，举行了欢迎会。
    叔叔们带了小客人们参观军舰。孩子们紧紧拉住海军叔叔的手，这一层又一层的高扶梯可不是玩的，有的地方，还得叔叔一个个地抱过去。小客人戴起了叔叔的水兵帽坐在炮位上，叔叔帮着他们把高射炮竖了起来，直指到天空。“小航海家”站在舰桥上捧起了大望远镜，向远处了望着。舰上的一切设备，简直使小客人们迷住了，边上的海军叔叔也笑着，顺手从口袋里掏出一把把从海参崴带来的糖果，塞到了小客人的手里，或者就把糖纸剥去，把糖冷不防一下塞进这些“小航海家”的嘴里……。
    上海复旦中学初中二年级学生徐克信听说苏联海军叔叔要到上海访问的消息以后，他和学校里的几个少先队员连夜赶制了一个绣着中苏友谊图案的花提包，准备送给海军叔叔，昨天在少年宫联欢会上，他和水兵尼古拉戈戈夫成了朋友。现在他们又在一起了。叔叔特地带他走到了高高的了望台上，对他说：“你们的国家是一个多么美丽的国家，你长大了要好好劳动，保卫祖国。”孩子用明亮的眼睛望着叔叔，好像要把叔叔的印象永远铭记在心里。
    在巡洋舰一层层的船台上，小朋友到处被大朋友包围着，手里的东西拿不下了，可是照片、书籍、画报、钢笔……还是从一只只不可能拒绝的手里塞了过来。今天少先队员们也带来了不少礼物要委托叔叔们带到莫斯科和海参崴，给苏联的少先队员们，这里有中国的大头娃娃，有天安门模型，有各种中国香袋。上海四川南路小学少年先锋队送的是一本精致的集邮簿，这里贴着我国开国以后发行的许多珍贵的邮票。上海市少先队永安队部第八中队送的是一幅把学习成绩告诉给志愿军叔叔的刺绣。
    船甲板上的歌舞会开始了，叔叔们又奏乐，又唱歌，还用中国话唱“东方红”，还表演杂技。逗得小客人们笑个不停。小客人也给叔叔们表演舞蹈和歌唱。和平中学的少先队员傅起凤，给叔叔们表演了三个魔术；这个十四岁的小魔术家，她熟练地拿起了一个小的蓝色口袋，放进去的是三条彩色的手帕，一会儿却变出来一幅写着“中苏友谊万岁”的红旗，旗上绣着两只紧握着的巨手，象征着中苏两国人民的友谊。当红旗在海风中飘动的时候，全甲板上的人都欢腾起来。傅起凤为了在今天表演这个节目，前几天他和他的同伴费尽苦心练了一遍又是一遍。联欢会上，她对一个叔叔说：“长大了我想做个魔术家。”叔叔赞许地说：“这是一个很有意义的职业。”傅起凤还托叔叔带一封信给国立莫斯科杂技团著名的演员契托希维利，叔叔说：“我一定给你带到。”
    当这边在联欢的时候，叔叔们在后甲板上已迅速地安排好了丰盛的午餐。苹果、果子汁、糖、鸡肉饭、果子面包……摆满了餐桌。小客人们坐到餐桌上时，大朋友立即成了最殷勤的招待员。这种招待是在任何地方都看不到的，客人不会用刀切鸡，“招待员”就一块块帮他们切碎，客人坐在凳上太矮，“招待员”就把他们抱在膝盖上吃，饭没吃完，果子汁已倒好了，削好的苹果已摆在旁边。吃饭中间，乐队一直在边上奏着动听的音乐，孩子们都知道这是海军对待贵宾才有的隆重礼节。最后叔叔们捧出了一大堆的礼物，每人一盒巧克力糖，一面绸子的红领巾，一枚少先队队章，这都是远从海参崴带来的。孩子们系起了鲜红色的新领巾，人人脸上泛起了幸福的红晕。
    告别的时候到了，但大朋友和小朋友都依依不舍地舍不得分离，舰上乐队奏起了离别的歌，军官和士兵都站在船舷傍，高唱着歌，挥动着帽子，大人和小孩的眼里，闪动着泪珠。孩子们用才学会的俄语高喊着“再见”，“中苏友好万岁”。小艇驶到了巡洋舰的北边，舰上的人都蜂拥到了北边。以后小艇驶到巡洋舰背后驶向西岸，舰上的人又一齐奔到了舰西边甲板，直到最后听不到感人的“乌拉”声，几百双手却还在那里挥动。（附图片）
