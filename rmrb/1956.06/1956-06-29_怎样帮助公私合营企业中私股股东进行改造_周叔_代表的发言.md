How to Help Private Shareholders in Joint State-Private Enterprises Undergo Transformation
    -- Speech by Representative Zhou Shutao

I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Secretary-General Peng Zhen.

After the industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin heard about Chairman Mao's cordial teachings to the industrial and commercial sectors last November, their general ideological understanding greatly improved. They initially recognized the laws of social development, clearly saw their future, and understood how to control their own destiny. At the same time, they further clarified that through the form of overall joint ownership, both large and small industrial and commercial enterprises could embark on the advanced form of state capitalism, which greatly encouraged the industrialists and businessmen. In particular, the state's policy of peaceful transformation, which would enable individuals to gradually transform themselves into self-reliant working citizens and eventually join the ranks of the working class as enterprises were further transformed, made them feel extremely excited. Thanks to this great inspiration, the socialist consciousness of industrialists and businessmen was greatly enhanced, and their confidence in taking the socialist road was strengthened. With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the impetus of objective circumstances, everyone unanimously proposed applying for overall joint ownership, requesting further transformation. In less than a month, all industrial and commercial sectors in the city had achieved joint state-private ownership.

During the transformation high tide, the Party and the government correctly led the joint ownership work and conscientiously implemented the central government's policies and guidelines. They relied on the workers and fully encouraged and brought into play the initiative of the industrialists and businessmen. In a very short period, they completed the work of clearing assets and verifying capital, basically achieving fairness and reasonableness, and seeking truth from facts. In dealing with creditor's rights and debts, they also implemented the spirit of lenient treatment and speedy settlement. In terms of personnel arrangements, they also implemented the policy of "taking them all in and giving them appropriate work" and the principle of "assigning jobs according to their abilities and giving appropriate consideration." As of the end of May this year, more than 2,000 private sector employees had been successively arranged in leadership positions at all levels, and the rest remained in their original positions. In terms of living standards, the principle of maintaining original salaries ensured that most private sector personnel maintained their original living standards and their lives were stabilized. The government also formulated effective measures for the welfare benefits of private sector personnel. At the same time as the overall joint ownership was approved, the government quickly established specialized companies by industry, including 35 specialized industrial companies and 17 specialized commercial companies and 180 general stores, to promptly lead the employees and private sector personnel of the joint ventures in socialist education, and to lead the development of socialist labor emulation drives. Therefore, in the past six months, Tianjin's joint venture work has achieved great success. However, due to lack of experience in this arduous and heavy work, shortcomings still exist. The implementation of policies in some grassroots units is also not balanced, with some being lax and some being strict, so some problems inevitably still exist. However, after these problems were discovered during inspections, they were actively addressed or are being studied for resolution. Of course, in the future implementation of policies, governments at all levels and relevant units are required to earnestly and thoroughly implement and correctly grasp them. For private sector personnel, it is even more urgent that they strive to catch up in terms of ideological transformation. In this way, problems will be solved better and faster.

During the transformation high tide, private sector employees generally showed a high degree of enthusiasm due to the improvement of their ideological understanding. After overall joint ownership, thanks to the correct measures and care and consideration of the Party and the government, they further played an active role and eagerly requested to study and actively strive for progress. Local Party and government departments strengthened the leadership of the industrial and commercial sectors in their studies. According to the demands of the masses, under the unified leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and specifically organized by the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen have now participated in various theoretical, policy, current affairs, and cultural studies. Many people have also shown active performance in social activities and socialist labor emulation drives. In the first quarter's competition and comparison, 256 people won the honorary titles of advanced producers and advanced workers along with the workers. More than 280 people have also received commendations and material rewards, which has further encouraged the enthusiasm of private sector employees to accept transformation. In short, Tianjin's industrial and commercial sectors are actively moving forward with the deepening of the transformation.

However, while private industrialists and businessmen are beginning to conduct in-depth ideological transformation, there are still some people who have not had the opportunity to receive systematic and profound transformation, that is, the non-working private shareholders in joint venture enterprises. They generally maintain their lives by dividend income, rarely participate in social activities, and rarely have the opportunity to participate in learning, so their ideological understanding is far behind the development of the objective situation. According to the analysis of the situation learned from the shareholders' meetings recently held by several enterprises in Tianjin, some of them are cadres, some have other occupations, some are young people, and some are housewives. Among them, some are old, weak, women, and children, some are lonely and helpless, and their economic conditions and cultural levels are very inconsistent. Generally, they are concerned about their future livelihood, work arrangements, and learning issues. Many people eagerly request to participate in learning, participate in work, and strive for progress, in order to prepare for their transformation into self-reliant laborers in the future. Facts show that in the comprehensive implementation of the policy of transforming private industry and commerce, their leadership should also be strengthened in the future, and their education and transformation should be emphasized at the same time as the education and transformation of private sector employees. However, this is a relatively heavy and complex task, and it is necessary to mobilize social forces from all aspects to jointly assist the government in overall planning to do this work well. Therefore, I would like to put forward some immature opinions on this issue, please correct me:

1.  To educate and transform non-working private shareholders of joint ventures, we should fully utilize the organizational strength of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the Women's Federation, and the boards of directors of joint ventures. In order to carry out this work in a planned and step-by-step manner, it is also necessary to conduct investigations and research in advance to have a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the basic situation of these people in terms of their thinking, culture, economy, and life. The investigation work can be carried out using the above-mentioned organizations. In new joint ventures that have not yet established a board of directors, the original enterprise负责人 [responsible person] or agent should be responsible for the investigation. Of course, the government and relevant departments should give strong support and help.

2.  The board of directors of joint ventures is responsible for assisting the government in educating and transforming private shareholders. After overall joint ownership, some people (including myself) believe that its role is only to represent private shareholders to receive fixed interest on a regular basis and that there is no need for it to continue to exist, ignoring its role in uniting, educating, and assisting the transformation of private shareholders. Now we realize that this view is wrong. Therefore, it is required that joint ventures that have already established boards of directors pay attention to this work, and joint ventures that have not yet established boards of directors should establish them as soon as possible according to the specialized company system.

3.  Regarding the education and transformation of private shareholders of joint ventures, I think the most important thing is to organize them to participate in learning. Under the current conditions, we can consider appropriately organizing some people to participate in various types of theoretical policy current affairs and cultural learning organized by the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, according to the different degrees of political and cultural level of private shareholders. For the general housewives among them, we can also consider organizing them to learn by the Women's Federation. For individual cases, the board of directors should take responsibility for organizing them to learn.

4.  In order to make these private shareholders recognize their future, while organizing them to learn, we can also consider gradually making appropriate work arrangements for those who have employment requirements and employment conditions, so that they can be transformed as soon as possible through learning and work experience as well as social life experience.

    怎样帮助公私合营企业中私股股东进行改造
    ——周叔?代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长、彭真秘书长的报告。
    天津市的工商业者在去年十一月听到传达毛主席对工商界的亲切教导后，一般的思想认识都大大地提高了一步，初步认识了社会发展规律、认清了前途，懂得了如何掌握自己的命运。同时也进一步明确了通过全业合营方式，不论大小工商企业都可以走上国家资本主义高级形式，给予工商业者极大的鼓舞。特别是对国家所采取的和平改造政策能够使个人随着企业的进一步改造逐步改造成为自食其力的劳动公民，最后走进工人阶级队伍中去，更感到无比的兴奋。由于这一个伟大的感召，大大地提高了工商业者的社会主义觉悟，增强了走社会主义道路的信心。随着农业合作化高潮的到来和客观形势的推动，大家一致提出申请全业合营，要求进一步接受改造。不到一个月的时间内，全市工商行业就都实现了公私合营。
    在改造高潮中，党和政府正确领导了合营工作，认真贯彻了中央的政策和方针。依靠职工并充分鼓励和发挥了工商业者的积极性。在很短时期内就完成了清产核资工作，基本上做到了公平合理、实事求是，对于债权债务的处理，也贯彻了从宽处理，尽速了结的精神。在人事安排方面，也贯彻了“包下来，给以适当工作”的方针，和“量才使用、适当照顾”的原则，截至今年五月底，被陆续安排在各级领导职务上的私方从业人员已有2，000多人，其余亦均原职未动。在生活待遇方面，由于掌握了原薪不动的原则，使大部分私方人员保持了原来生活水平，生活得到安定。对私方人员的福利待遇，也由政府制定了有效措施。在全业合营批准的同时，政府迅速按行业建立了专业公司，计工业上有35个专业公司，商业上有17个专业公司和180个总店，及时领导合营企业的职工和私方人员，进行了社会主义教育，并领导着开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。因此，半年来，天津市的合营工作获得了很大的成绩。但是对这一艰巨繁重的工作，由于缺乏经验，缺点还是存在的。在部分基层单位中对政策的贯彻也不够平衡，有松有紧，因而不可避免地仍还存在一些问题，不过在检查发现后，都积极加以处理，或正在研究解决。当然，在今后执行政策方面，还要求各级政府及有关单位切实深入贯彻，正确掌握；对于私方人员，更迫切要求他们在思想改造方面努力赶上前去。这样，才会使问题解决得更好、更快。
    在改造高潮中，私方从业人员由于思想认识的提高，一般都表现了高度的积极性。在全业合营后，由于党和政府的正确措施和关怀照顾，更进一步发挥了积极作用，并迫切要求学习，积极争取进步，地方党政有关部门加强了对工商界学习的领导。根据群众的要求，在政协天津市委员会统一领导，市工商联、民建会具体组织下，目前绝大多数工商业者都已分别参加了各种理论、政策、时事和文化学习。不少人在从事社会活动和参加社会主义劳动竞赛中，也都有着积极的表现。在第一季度竞赛评比中，有256人和职工一道获得了先进生产者和先进工作者的光荣称号。还有280多人得到了表扬和物质奖励，因而更加鼓舞了私方从业人员接受改造的积极热情。总之天津市工商界正在随着改造的深入进展而积极的前进着。
    但是在私营工商业者开始深入进行思想改造的同时，还有一部分人没有机会得到系统的深刻的改造，那就是合营企业中不在职的私股股东，他们一般是靠股息收入维持生活，平常很少参加社会活动，也很少有机会参加学习，因而在思想认识上更是远远落后于客观形势的发展。根据天津市几个企业最近召开的股东会了解到的情况分析，他们中间有的是干部、有的另有职业、也有青年、也有家庭妇女，其中有一部分是老弱妇孺，有的是孤独无依，经济情况和文化水平极不一致，一般关心的是今后的生活问题、工作安排问题和学习问题。有好多人迫切要求参加学习、参加工作，要求进步，为今后改造成为自食其力的劳动者作好准备。事实说明，在对私营工商业改造政策的全面贯彻中，今后也应该对他们加强领导，与在职私方的教育改造同时重视起来。不过这是一件比较繁重复杂的工作，必须动员各方面的社会力量共同协助政府统筹规划，把这一个工作做好。因此，我愿意对这一个问题，提出几点不成熟的意见，请各位指正：
    一、对合营企业不在职私股股东进行教育改造，应充分运用工商联、同业公会、民建会、妇联以及合营企业的董事会等各种组织力量。为了有计划、有步骤地开展这项工作，又必须事先做好调查研究，对这些人的思想、文化、经济、生活等方面的基本情况进行普遍深入的了解。调查工作可运用上述组织进行。在新合营企业内还没有成立董事会组织的，应由原企业负责人或代理人负责进行。当然，政府及各有关部门要给予大力的支持和帮助。
    二、合营企业的董事会组织，担负着协助政府教育改造私股股东的任务。在全业合营后，有的人（包括我个人在内）认为它的作用只是代表私股股东按期领发定息，没有继续存在的必要，忽略了它对私股股东应起的团结教育和协助改造的作用，现在认识到这种看法是错误的。因此，要求已经设有董事会的合营企业把这一工作重视起来，还没有设立董事会的合营企业，亦应按专业公司系统尽速建立。
    三、对合营企业私股股东的教育改造，我认为最主要的应该是组织他们参加学习。在目前的条件下，可考虑根据私股股东不同程度的政治和文化水平，适当地组织一部分人参加到工商联和民建组织的理论政策时事文化各类学习中去，其中的一般家庭妇女，也可以考虑由妇联组织起来进行学习，个别情况的人，则由董事会负起责任来组织他们学习。
    四、为了使这些私股股东认清前途，在组织他们进行学习的同时，对其中有就业要求又有就业条件的人，也可以考虑逐步地进行适当的工作安排，使他们通过学习和工作的锻炼以及社会生活的体验，尽早地得到改造。
