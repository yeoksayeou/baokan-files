Xinhua News Agency, June 5th - The Romanian "Skylark" Folk Dance and Music Ensemble gave its first performance in China tonight in Beijing.

The piece "The Skylark," performed by soloist Ion Oprea on the Romanian folk instrument "Nai," was one of the most popular programs of the evening. The performer used a panpipe made of many small bamboo tubes and, with his superb technique, performed a melodious tune, like a skylark singing sweetly. Amidst repeated cheers and thunderous applause in the hall, he performed it again and added a new piece. The ensemble is named after this piece, which is deeply loved by the Romanian people.

The dance drama "Wedding in the Somes River Basin," which was the first program of tonight's performance, was also warmly received by the audience. In this dance drama, praised by the famous Soviet choreographer Moiseyev as a "true symphony in Romanian dance," Romanian dancers expressed the humorous ancient customs of this region with healthy, lively, and enthusiastic dance postures, depicting the joyous scenes of people celebrating a wedding.

The dance "Paintings in the Gallery," with its unique style, was the last program performed tonight. As night fell, the figures in five famous paintings jumped out of the paintings and danced together, returning to the paintings in the dawn. This dance was based on the Romanian composer George Enescu's First Romanian Rhapsody and several famous paintings in the Romanian National Art Gallery. It expresses the joy and struggle of the Romanian people.

Among the other five dance programs performed tonight were three folk dances with the characteristics of various Romanian provinces, as well as the Chinese Red Silk Dance and the Soviet Ukrainian Dance.

Female singer Angela Moldovan sang four Romanian folk songs tonight, and sang "Kangding Love Song" in Chinese. Her rounded voice combined with dramatic expressions left a deep impression on the audience. The solos of male singers Ian Cristorianu and Vi. Bujor demonstrated high qualities. The two humorous songs they sang, "Everyone Has Troubles" and "Oh! My Dear!", were both sung again. The performance of Romanian folk instrument "Cobza" solo and other programs were warmly welcomed.

At the opening ceremony before the performance, Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of the Chinese Ministry of Culture, and Yani Nicolae, head of the Romanian "Skylark" Folk Dance and Music Ensemble, spoke successively.

Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture, Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Romanian Ambassador to China Guo Zuowen, Chinese Ambassador to Romania Ke Bonian, people from the literary and art circles in the capital, as well as diplomatic envoys and diplomats from various countries in China, totaling more than 1,500 people, attended the opening ceremony and watched the performance tonight.
