    Opening Up Broad Prospects for the Development of Agricultural Productivity
    —Speech by Representative Li Hui
    I fully agree with and support the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Minister Liao Luyan.
    Recently, I conducted inspections in several agricultural cooperatives and deeply felt that the high tide of the socialist revolution in rural areas has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the high development of agricultural productivity. This, in turn, has raised new issues for the organization and leadership of agricultural production.
    Southern Shanxi is a purely agricultural area, producing wheat and cotton. In recent years, it has implemented the policy of combining organization with improved technology, and agricultural development has been relatively rapid. The unit area yield of wheat was 88 jin in 1949 and reached 112 jin in 1951. Cotton production was only around 18 jin during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but it reached 49 jin in 1952. Based on this foundation, agricultural cooperatives were established on a trial basis in 1952. By 1954, the number of households participating in cooperatives reached 34.6%, and the number of households organized, including mutual aid teams, reached 65%. At that time, some people believed that this rate of development was already very fast and that any faster would be dangerous. Others believed that production could only increase slowly in the future and that rapid improvement would have to wait for the arrival of mechanization. However, the facts are not so. Thanks to the wise and correct leadership of the Party and the government, full-scale advanced cooperation was achieved in just four months from last winter to this spring. The 800,000 individual small-farmer economies were organized into nearly 3,000 large-scale socialist collective economies, with 98% of farm households participating in advanced agricultural cooperatives. This fundamental change has enabled agricultural production to develop by leaps and bounds. This year, the average wheat yield per mu can reach 140 jin, exceeding the unit area yield in 1955 by 18%. Because the summer harvest of each agricultural cooperative generally exceeded the grain production target set by the "three fixings" policy last year, farmers can obtain a higher amount of grain than the assigned purchase and retention quotas, thereby improving their lives. For example, the Jianghong Agricultural Cooperative in Hongzhao County saw its wheat yield this year exceed the average yield of 315 jin per mu in the area last year (regardless of irrigation) by 32%, greatly exceeding the cooperative's original planned yield. After the preliminary distribution of the summer harvest, 96% of the 738 households had higher incomes than last summer. Although the income of 30 households was slightly lower, most of them also had non-agricultural income to make up for the difference. For households with financial difficulties, the cooperative can completely solve the problem with public welfare funds and other means. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangfen County increased its wheat production by 17.2%. After retaining 322 jin of wheat per person in accordance with the unified purchase policy, each work day can still be distributed 2.05 jin of wheat. If the planned production of a small number of autumn crops is included, each person can obtain 481 jin of grain throughout the year, far exceeding the state's unified purchase and retention standards.
    The change in agricultural relations of production has a liberating and promoting effect on agricultural productive forces, mainly manifested in two aspects:
    First, comprehensive cooperation has continuously raised socialist ideology in rural areas, changed the relationship between people, and also changed the relationship between people and nature, greatly inspiring and encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. Poor peasants felt that they had something to rely on, something to look forward to, and their production and life difficulties were solved. Their emotions were very high. Wealthier peasants have also further understood the future of society and eliminated their illusions about capitalism. They realistically see that socialism is not asking them to suffer losses, but is much safer, stronger, and faster than operating on their own. They have stopped hesitating and actively invested in collective labor. The broad masses of peasants have realized the greatness of collective strength, thereby eliminating the idea of ​​resigning themselves to fate and establishing the belief that man can conquer nature. This has created an unprecedented upsurge in agricultural production. In the two months of last winter, more than 400,000 laborers in the district were invested in water conservancy construction, accounting for more than one-fourth of the total number of male and female full and semi-laborers in rural areas. According to statistics from 11 cooperatives in 4 counties, the labor attendance rate in the spring plowing campaign reached 87%, an increase of 30% over the same period last year. For example, in the Guoguang Agricultural Cooperative led by Qu Yaoli, hand-cranked waterwheels were modified for blind people, allowing 2 blind people to irrigate 6 mu of land per day, which is equivalent to 5 work days. There were also 17 cripples who specialized in chopping grass, earning 10 points per person per day. Old men and women repaired agricultural tools and took care of children, earning 3 points per person per day. Due to the full play of labor enthusiasm, many creations and improvements have emerged in basic construction, labor organization, tool improvement, technical reform, and sideline businesses, demonstrating the wisdom and talent of the working people. This is a very important factor in improving agricultural production.
    However, such high labor enthusiasm needs to be correctly guided and used, and needs to be constantly encouraged, in order to play its due role and be continuously developed. The most important thing is to properly combine personal interests with the overall interests of the cooperative. Judging from the current situation of agricultural cooperatives, there are some problems in this regard. On the one hand, due to lack of experience and inability to manage, there are shortcomings such as unreasonable labor quotas, chaotic work point recording systems, emphasis on quantity over quality, and lack of reasonable reward methods. On the other hand, due to certain misunderstandings of the socialist system among some activists and peasants, such as the belief that socialism only emphasizes collective interests and does not require personal interests, and that engaging in sideline businesses is developing capitalism, phenomena such as neglecting the development of diversified economy and individual household sideline businesses, and excessively restricting the production and life activities of cooperative members have emerged. There are also irrational treatments of members' property upon joining the cooperative and other personal property, such as failure to repay members' investments on schedule as required, and arbitrary and gratuitous use of members' personal property, and blind promotion of "turning dead treasures into living treasures." Therefore, a few members still have some doubts and concerns. Individual poor peasants consider whether the cooperative can solve their practical difficulties; individual wealthy middle peasants consider whether they will suffer losses. These all hinder the further development of labor enthusiasm.
    Therefore, the prompt promulgation of the model charter of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, using the charter to educate cadres and the masses to eliminate certain misunderstandings and concerns, democratically discussing and formulating each cooperative's own charter, and learning to act in accordance with the charter, are indeed pressing problems that need to be solved at present. I think that the formulation of the model charter and its clear provisions on various important issues are very correct.
    Second, labor enthusiasm is only the basis for developing agricultural production. Where labor enthusiasm is used and what specific and effective measures are taken to increase production are the keys to achieving agricultural production increase. After comprehensive cooperation, the planned socialist management method has created very favorable development conditions for various production reform work, and various productions have been carried out on an unprecedented scale. The water conservancy construction work last winter and this spring has shown a new situation that cannot be compared with the past. So far, the various water conservancy projects completed in the district can expand the irrigation area by 1.3 million mu, more than twice the sum of the previous three years. For example, in Anyi County, 1,200 wells were dug in the 7 years since liberation. Only 180 wells were dug in the entire year of 1955. This year, the plan to dig 2,300 wells was already a very large plan. As a result, 2,200 wells were completed in one month, exceeding the total results of 7 years by one time. This year's afforestation work is also different from the past, showing that it has a focus, is organized, widespread, rapid, complete, and has achieved remarkable results.
    Directly affecting the growth and harvest of crops is the improvement and improvement of farming techniques. Only after comprehensive cooperation can agricultural activities be comprehensively and systematically organized in accordance with the necessary technical operating procedures. This spring, we promoted the "nine early, three more, one late" cotton high-yield experience in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and launched a million-mu large-scale production increase demonstration campaign, and the quality of cotton field sowing has been greatly improved. However, many rural organizations and cadres do not yet have sufficient understanding of the importance of combining organization with improved technology to achieve agricultural production increase. Agricultural production technology work is far from keeping up with the needs of agricultural production development after cooperation. Therefore, changing this situation and vigorously launching technical reform work as powerfully as the rectification campaign in the cooperatives has become a major task in rural areas.
    Therefore, I believe that: First, rural grassroots organizations and higher-level leading organs need to take agricultural technology work as one of the central tasks and conduct regular, in-depth, and specific research and leadership. In particular, it is necessary to enable all cadres engaged in rural work to learn specific production knowledge and go deep into the fields to carry out specific organization and guidance. This will enable the technical reform movement to be carried out in a thorough, comprehensive, correct and effective manner, so as to better guarantee agricultural production increase. Second, the quality of technical institutions and personnel below the county level is very weak and cannot bear such a major task. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively strengthen and rectify rural technical guidance institutions, change and improve the quality of existing technical personnel. It is also necessary to form a huge technical network in rural areas and cultivate a large number of rural technical activists, so that agricultural technology work becomes a mass movement. Third, agricultural production technology is very complex and has strong local adaptability. Therefore, the formulation of various technical measures and the promotion of experience require particularly serious and cautious investigation, research, experimentation, and summary. The Jinan area has learned a lesson in this regard. For example, wheat aphids occurred widely and seriously in 1952, but because wrong pest control methods were used, the losses caused by pest control exceeded the losses caused by pests, resulting in a serious reduction in wheat production and extreme dissatisfaction among the masses. Another example is that the scale of farmland water conservancy construction is currently very large. Due to the lack of technical guidance, there is also a blind phenomenon, resulting in a lot of waste of human and financial resources.
    Due to my own lack of theoretical level and practical experience, my understanding of the issues may not be correct. Please give your advice to all representatives.

### 为农业生产力的发展打开了广阔前途——李辉代表的发言

    为农业生产力的发展打开了广阔前途  
    ——李辉代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理，彭真副委员长和廖鲁言部长的报告。
    最近我到几个农业社里进行了视察，深深的感觉到农村社会主义革命的高潮给农业生产力的高度发展打开了无限广阔的前途，而这又给农业生产的组织和领导提出了新的问题。
    晋南是纯农业地区，出产小麦和棉花，几年来贯彻执行了组织起来与提高技术相结合的方针，农业的发展是较快的。小麦单位面积产量1949年为88斤，1951年达到112斤，棉花在抗战时期只产18斤左右，1952年产到49斤。在这个基础上1952年开始试办农业合作社，至1954年入社农户达到34.6％，连互助组在内组织起来的农户达到65％。当时，有人认为这样的发展速度算是很快的了，再快就有危险，也有人认为今后生产只能缓步上升，必须等机械化的到来才能有很快的提高。但是事实并不如此，由于党和政府英明正确的领导，仅仅经过去冬今春四个月时间，就实现了全面的高级合作化，参加高级农业社的农户已达总农户的98％强，把80多万户个体小农经济组成为近3，000个大规模经营的社会主义集体经济。这一个根本的变革，使农业生产得到飞跃发展。今年小麦产量可达每亩平均140斤，超过1955年单位面积产量的18％。由于各农业社夏季收获量普遍超过了去年粮食三定的定产指标，农民就可以得到比定购留量指标高的粮食数量，来改善自己的生活。例如，洪赵县江虹农业社，今年小麦产量，比去年该地水旱平均亩产315斤超过了32％，大大超过社里原来的计划产量。经过夏收预分，在738户中有96％的户比去年夏季增加了收入。有30户的收入虽然稍有降低，但他们多数还有非农业收入来补足。对于生活困难的户，社内也完全可以由公益金和其他方面设法帮助解决。襄汾县东方红农业社由于小麦增产了17.2％，除按统购政策每人应留小麦322斤外，每个劳动日尚可分得小麦2.05斤。如将少数秋季作物按计划产量计算在内，全年每人可得粮食481斤，超过国家规定的统购留粮标准很多。
    农业生产关系的改变，对农业生产力的解放及推动作用，主要表现在两个方面：
    第一，全面合作化使农村社会主义思想得到不断地高涨，人与人的关系有了变化，人与自然的关系也有了变化、大大启发鼓舞了广大农民的劳动积极性。贫苦的农民感到有了依靠，有了指望，生产和生活上的困难得到了解决，他们的情绪十分高涨。富裕的农民也更进一步地认识了社会前途，消除了对资本主义的幻想。他们实际地看到社会主义并不是叫他们吃亏，而且比自己单独经营要保险得多，力量大得多，发展快得多。他们就终止了犹豫徘徊，积极投入到集体劳动中来。广大农民体会到集体力量的伟大，从而扫除了听天由命的思想，树立起人定胜天的信念。这样就形成了空前的农业生产热潮。在去冬两个月中，全区投入水利建设的劳力达40余万个，占农村所有男女全半劳力总数四分之一以上。据4个县的11个社统计：投入春耕运动的劳动出勤率达到87％，较去年同期提高了30％。例如在曲耀离所领导的国光农业社中，为瞎子改装了手摇水车，使得2个瞎子每天能浇地6亩，可顶5个劳动日。还有17个跛子专门参加铡草工作，每人每天可得10分，老汉、老婆修理农具和看小孩，每人每天还得到3分。由于劳动积极性的充分发挥，在基本建设、劳动组织、工具改良、技术改革和副业等各方面都出现了许多的创造和改进，表现了劳动人民的聪明才干，这是提高农业生产非常重要的因素。
    但是，这样高的劳动积极性需要正确地引导和运用，并且需要经常的鼓励，才能发挥应有的作用和得到不断的发扬。最主要的就是必须把个人利益和社的整体利益恰当地结合起来。这一点从现在农业社的情况看来，是存在一些问题的。一方面，由于缺乏经验，不会管理，就产生了劳动定额不合理，记工制度混乱，重量不重质，缺乏合理的奖励办法等缺点。另一方面，由于在部分积极分子和农民中还存在着某些对社会主义制度的误解，如认为社会主义就是只讲集体利益不要个人利益，认为搞副业就是发展资本主义等，就产生了忽视发展多种经济和个人家庭副业，以及对社员的生产、生活活动限制太死等现象。还有的对社员入社的财产和其它个人的财产处理不够合理，如应分期归还的社员投资，没有作到按规定时间还本付息，以及少数随意无偿使用社员个人财产、盲目提倡“死宝变活宝”等。因此，也还有少数社员尚有某些怀疑和顾虑。个别贫农考虑社里是不是能够解决他的实际困难；个别的富裕中农考虑是不是会使自己吃亏。这些，都妨碍劳动积极性进一步的发扬。
    所以，迅速地公布高级农业生产合作社示范章程，用社章来教育干部和群众以消除某些误解和顾虑，民主讨论制定各社自己的社章，并学会按社章办事，这些的确是当前迫切需要解决的问题。示范章程的制定和其中对各重要问题所作的明确规定，我认为是非常正确的。
    第二，劳动积极性只是发展农业生产的基础，而劳动积极性用到什么地方，采取那些具体的有效的增产措施，是实现农业增产的关键。全面合作化后，有计划的社会主义的经营方式使得各项生产改革工作有了非常有利的发展条件，各项生产得到了空前未有的大规模的开展。去冬今春水利建设工作出现了和过去不能相比的新局面。至目前为止，全区已经完成的各项水利工程可扩大浇地面积130万亩，超过前三年总和的两倍。如安邑县解放7年来打水井1，200眼，1955年全年只打井180眼，今年计划打井2，300眼已经是很大的计划了，结果一个月就完成了2，200眼，超过7年总成绩一倍。今年春季造林工作也与以往不同，表现出有重点、有组织、普遍、迅速、有始有终，成绩显著。
    直接影响着农作物的生长和收成的，是耕作技术的提高和改进，也只有在全面合作化后，才能全面地系统地按照必需的技术操作规程来组织农事活动。今春我们推广了新疆维吾尔自治区“九早、三多、一晚”的棉花丰产经验，并开展了百万亩大面积增产示范运动，棉田播种的质量有了很大的改进提高。但是，许多农村组织和干部，对于组织起来必须与提高技术相结合才能达到农业增产的重要性，还没有足够的认识，农业生产技术工作，还远远赶不上合作化后农业生产发展的需要。所以改变这个情况，使技术改革工作与整社工作同样有力的开展起来，就成为当前农村一项重大任务。
    因此，我认为：第一，农村的基层组织和上级领导机关，有必要把农业技术工作作为中心任务之一，进行经常的深入的具体研究和领导。尤其是要使所有作农村工作的干部，都学会具体的生产知识，深入田间去进行具体的组织和指导，这样便会使技术改革运动，深入全面的正确有效的开展起来，使农业增产有更好的保证。第二，现在县以下的技术机构和人员的质量很薄弱，远远担负不起这样重大的任务，所以，有必要切实地加强与整顿农村技术指导机构，改变和提高现有技术人员的质量。还需要在农村组成一个巨大的技术网，培养出大批的农村技术积极分子，使农业技术工作成为群众性的运动。第三，农业生产技术是很复杂的，地方适应性又很强，因此对于各种技术措施的制定、经验的推广，特别需要认真谨慎地调查研究和试验总结。在这一点上晋南地区是有过教训的。如1952年麦蚜普遍发生，又很严重，但是因为用了错误的治虫方法，形成治虫害造成的损失，超过虫害的损失，使小麦严重减产，群众极为不满。又如目前农田水利建设规模很大，由于缺乏技术指导力量，也有盲目现象，造成不少的人力财力的浪费。
    由于我自己理论水平和实际经验的不足，对问题的认识不一定正确，请各位代表指教。
