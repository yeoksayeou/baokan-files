    At the Long-Distance Telephone Switchboard
    Fu Geng
    In the Tianjin Long-Distance Telephone Exchange, there's this girl, tall and sturdy, with two foot-long braids, bouncing and skipping around, lively yet seasoned. At first glance, you'd never guess she's only twenty-one, let alone that she was the one who started eliminating the arguing and disunity among the operators, improving work efficiency. She herself took the lead, making no mistakes for seven consecutive months, setting a new record of connecting nineteen long-distance calls per hour.
    This is Zhou Hong, a telephone operator with only four years of experience, but a labor model for three years!
    In terms of technique and operation, she can be counted as one of the best in the Tianjin exchange. If you were to ask the technical inspection team about her, they'd be sure to tell you a whole set of experiences, too many to count. But what everyone loves to talk about even more is a proposal she made last year: "Actively cooperate, strive to help, be considerate of the other party, and explain patiently."
    Don't look down on this sixteen-character proposal; it's her personal experience from several years of work!
    In the winter of 1953, Zhou Hong was assigned to a switchboard specifically for connecting with Beijing. One night, she called the girl on the other end: "Xiao Zhao? The leadership is transferring me to connect with another switchboard."
    "What?" the girl on the other end became anxious. She remembered when she first met Zhou Hong, she couldn't hear clearly and often made mistakes; the headset felt like a big rock, pressing tightly on her head, and she was flustered and anxious to the point of crying. Zhou Hong helped her like an older sister, and was extremely attentive. For example, when she made a mistake, if it were someone else, they would definitely say, "Listen carefully before connecting!" But what if you just can't hear clearly? Zhou Hong was different. She always patiently analyzed: "You often can't hear 006 clearly, would it be better if I spoke slower in the future?" Over the past year, she and Zhou Hong had become good friends, and she had trained herself to be one of the most skilled in the Beijing long-distance exchange. Now, how could she bear to leave this good teacher she had never met!
      "I hate to leave you too, but..." Zhou Hong comforted her with a trembling voice. The other party "sniffed" and started crying. Zhou Hong's heart was also burning, and she really wanted to cry, but she bit her wide lips and held back. More than a year of learning and training had made her gradually stronger. She knew that the leadership was transferring her to connect with another switchboard because it ran through the entire Northeast region, was the most complex, and the relationship between Tianjin and their operators was the worst. As a member of the Communist Youth League, she understood what role she should play!
    As soon as she got to the other switchboard, difficulties immediately attacked Zhou Hong. This switchboard connected to many places in the Northeast, and many place names had never been heard before. Even worse, the other end had a girl with the code name "32" who had a truly rude temper.
    It was still the first telephone confrontation—
      "Are you called Zhou Hong? A labor model, right?"
    "It's thanks to everyone's help."
    "Easy for you to say? Your photo was even published in the newspaper, and you published your thoughts: how you studied hard, how you helped others, how amazing! But I won't connect any calls for you, let's see how you can be a model!"
      "What kind of talk is that!" Zhou Hong's face flushed red, like a ripe apple. So angry! Who doesn't know that a long-distance call requires the cooperation of operators from at least two places to be connected, and can you not talk about collectivism? Where have I ever emphasized the individual?!
    Zhou Hong really wanted to retort, but remembering how Guo Xiuyun was even more amiable when the other party was angry when she answered the phone, she also tried to hold back her anger and do the same. But this young mistress was really hard to serve, easily triggered. She pronounced "Yan" (延) as "Yan" (燕), and Zhou Hong gently asked, "Which Yan?"
      "Write whichever Yan you want!"
      "Comrade, if I don't understand, it's hard to connect the call!"
      "Serves you right if you don't understand, serves you right if you don't understand!" It was like opening a machine gun.
    Tears dripped from Zhou Hong's cheeks, she pressed the pencil hard on the paper, making a hole in it, and the pencil tip broke. She changed to another one and still said softly: "Comrade, you should tell me while you have time to be angry."
    The other party didn't answer. After a while, Zhou Hong asked again.
      "Yan as in Yan'an." Obviously, this arrogant young girl was also a little embarrassed.
    After work, the young sisters started complaining—
      "That person is really arrogant!"
      "I had an argument with her yesterday!"
      "Let's find a way to make trouble for her next time..."
    Zhou Hong really wanted to curse along with everyone. She angrily tore up scrap paper, tearing it into pieces, but she still said loudly: "No, comrades! Our technology is not skilled, we also have shortcomings, they are busy with work, they are anxious, we should—" Her voice slowly trembled: "Be considerate of... the other party!"
    In a group meeting, she and the young sisters studied how to familiarize themselves with the business, actively cooperate with the other party, and use actions to move them. Everyone praised Zhou Hong for her good nature. Actually, how could Zhou Hong not be angry? After returning home, she barely spoke to her mother, eating with her head down, reading with her head down, or covering her head with the quilt and suffocating on the bed. Yes, she didn't want to shout out her grievances to the masses, making the relationship between everyone and the other exchange, especially with "32," worse and worse. For the sake of work, for the sake of the collective interest, she could endure anything!
    However, she reflected this situation to the organization.
    Li Jingshan, a Party branch committee member and also the director of the Tianjin Long-Distance Exchange, loved young Zhou Hong like a mother. She asked with concern: "Can't hold it in anymore?"
      "Mm!" Zhou Hong poured out all her grievances of the past few days like she had met her closest relative, and finally said in a fit of pique: "There's really no way to deal with this person!"
    Director Li smiled gently, "Don't just get upset, labor model, you can't talk like that." She talked to Zhou Hong about many principles like she was coaxing a child, and said that the leadership would definitely contact the other exchange through organizational relations, and finally tilted her face and asked Zhou Hong: "Really no way at all? Think about it, the most difficult work is ideological work, but it's also the most important work!"
    Walking out of the director's office, Zhou Hong's heart felt like a big stone had been removed. She hummed a song and returned home, playing with her younger brother again. After playing for a while, Zhou Hong thought about the other exchange's affairs again. Right, we should think of a way!
    Zhou Hong had recently developed a habit of putting "?" after everything for herself. Now, she started putting "?" after the other exchange's "32" again. She thought: What is the root of this comrade's thinking? Is she opposing me? No! She is opposing work. She must not understand how many major national events, how many factories and mines, are transmitted through our operators every day, and how work is affected if a telephone call cannot be connected. We should tell her! But how to tell her? Write a letter! Won't people laugh at me: "Look, Zhou Hong is begging for mercy!" No, they won't laugh, this is important ideological work!
    Zhou Hong sent the first letter to the other party. There was no reply. The improvement in work was not great either. Once, Zhou Hong was so angry with the other party that she started crying. The shift leader quickly came over and asked with concern:
  "What's wrong again?" Zhou Hong angrily pointed to the stars flashing on the console and said, "Look, she's constantly being difficult, the phone can't be connected, it's so heartbreaking!"
    The shift leader's face changed color with anger and said, "You go take a break, I'll replace you!"
    Zhou Hong thought that was wrong: If the shift leader came up, she would definitely start arguing with the other party. If the other party's shift leader was disturbed, "32" would also lose face. She quickly wiped her tears and said: "I'll deal with her again!" Then she suppressed her anger and said excitedly: "Comrade, if you have any opinions about me, criticize me when you have time! Please connect the call first..."
    The other party didn't reply, but the calls were immediately connected one by one. Her heart was also excited! Yes, in our team, there are indeed still people like "32." She learned some skills at a young age, and her eyes went above her head. She said whatever she wanted, and did whatever she wanted. In her mind, what was important was not others, not the whole, but herself! But how could this kind of person expect that there were also other people, and the majority of people, like Zhou Hong, who were thinking about work and thinking about others everywhere. Even after receiving so much anger from others, she was still thinking about others?!
    Soon, the other exchange began education on labor discipline, and "32" received strict education. And Zhou Hong? She sent a second letter, a third letter, and even a fourth and fifth letter to the other party, and also sent a set of capital city scenic photos that the Beijing exchange had given her, hoping to establish a new friendship.
    The reply from the other exchange came! It is said that "32" always rushed to read Zhou Hong's letters first, and then proudly told everyone: "Look, Zhou Hong has written to us again!" Several times she was so moved that she sobbed and cried, saying: "I have two teachers, one is the comrade here, and the other is Zhou Hong."
    But Zhou Hong didn't fully know about the other party's changes, she only found that the cooperation in work had improved, the call connection rate had greatly increased, and the other party's letters were also very warm. Zhou Hong began to further study the business, memorize place names, and better cooperate with the other exchange.
    At night, Zhou Hong sat at the switchboard, and as soon as she had free time, she immediately memorized. For convenience, she also thought of a way to classify them, like Lushun and Fushun, she put them in the "Shun" category, and there were also "Kou" and "Da" categories, etc. Zhou Hong's red notebook was densely filled with learning experiences...
    In 1955, Zhou Hong finally proposed the above sixteen-character proposal, creatively enriching the Guo Xiuyun work method.

    在长途电话台上
    福庚
    在天津长途报话局里，有这么一个姑娘，长得高大结实，拖着两条一尺长的辫子，跳跳蹦蹦的，活泼而又老练，猛一看，真猜不出她只有二十一岁，更想不到就是她开始消除话务员们吵架、不团结的现象，提高了工作效率。而她自己就一马当先，连续七个月没出差错，创造了每小时接通十九只长途电话的新纪录。
    这就是只有四年工龄，但是当了三年劳动模范的话务员——周宏。
    论技术、操作，在天津台可算数一数二了，要是你去向她们的技术检查组打听打听，人家一准对你介绍一大套经验，数也数不清。可是大伙更爱谈的，是她去年提出的一个倡议：“主动配合，争取帮助，体谅对方，耐心解释”。
    别瞧不起这十六个字的倡议，这是她几年来工作中的切身体验哩！
    1953年冬天，周宏专门包一只同北京联系的台子。那天深夜，她打了个电话给对方的姑娘：“小赵吗；领导上调我同另一个台联系去啦。”
    “什么？”小姑娘急了。她想起自己刚同周宏接触的时候，听话也听不清，常接错；耳机子就像块大石头，紧紧压在头上，手忙脚乱地，急得直哭。周宏就像大姊姊一样帮助她，而且顶细心。譬如接错的时候，要是别人，准说：“你听清再接吧！”但是就是听不清怎办？周宏可不同，她总是耐心分析着：“你006常听不清，我以后说慢些好不好？”一年来，她同周宏早成了好朋友啦，自己也锻炼成北京长途台技术最高的一个。如今，叫她怎么舍得离开这个没有见过面的好师傅呢！
      “我也舍不得离开你呀，但……”周宏颤着声音安慰她。对方“哧”地一声哭起来。周宏心里也热辣辣地，真想哭，可她咬咬阔嘴唇，忍住了。一年多来的学习锻炼，使她慢慢坚强起来。她知道：领导上调她联系的另一个台，因为它贯通整个东北区，最复杂，而天津和她们话务员间的关系也最差，作为一个团员，她懂得应该起什么作用！
    一上了另一个台，困难立刻向周宏进攻。这个台通东北的地方多，许多地名从来没听到过；更糟的，是对方有个代号“32”的姑娘，脾气可真蛮横。
    还是第一次电话交锋——
      “你就叫周宏吗？劳动模范是不是？”
    “靠大家帮助嘛。”
    “说得倒好听？报上也登相片啦，还发表感想：怎样苦学苦练啊，怎样帮助别人啊，真了不起！可我不给你接电话，看你这个模范当得成！？”
      “这算什么话！”周宏唰的一下脸涨得通红，就像一只熟透的苹果。真气呀！谁不知道，一只长途电话，起码要两个地方以上的话务员共同配合，才能接通，还能不讲个集体主义？自己在什么地方突出过个人呢？！
    周宏真想顶她几句，但是想起郭秀云接电话的时候，对方发火，自己更和蔼，便也忍住气试着这样做。可这个小姑奶奶真难服侍，一触即发。她把“延”读作“燕”，周宏轻轻问了下：“什么燕？”
      “你爱写什么燕就什么燕！”
      “同志，我听不懂不好接通电话呀！”
      “听不懂活该，听不懂活该！”简直像开机关枪。
    泪水从周宏的脸颊上巴达、巴达滴下来，她狠狠地把铅笔揿在纸上，纸给揿了个洞，笔头也断了，她换了一枝，还是柔声说：“同志，你有发脾气功夫，也该告诉我了。”
    对方不答理。稍停，周宏又问。
      “延安的延。”显然，这位骄横的小姑娘，也有点不好意思起来。
    下班后，小姊妹们嚷开啦——
      “这个人真自高自大！”
      “我昨天就同她吵了一场！”
      “咱们下次想法找她麻烦……”
    周宏也真想跟着大家骂一顿，她生气地撕着废纸，把它们撕成了碎片，但是她还是大声说：“不，同志们！咱们技术不熟练，也有缺点，人家工作忙，心里急，咱们应该——”她声音慢慢颤抖起来：“体谅对……方！”
    在一次小组会上，她同小姊妹们研究怎样熟悉业务，主动配合对方，用行动来感动她们。大伙都夸周宏性子好，其实，周宏怎么会不气呢？回家以后，她连妈妈也不大答理了，闷着头吃饭，闷着头看书，要么用被子蒙着头，睡在床上蹩气。是的，她不想把自己的委屈向群众乱嚷嚷，使大伙同对方台尤其同“32”号的关系越搞越坏，为了工作，为了集体的利益，她什么都能忍受啊！
    但是，她把这个情况向组织反映了。
    党支部委员李静善，也是天津长途台的主任，她像妈妈一样热爱年轻的周宏。她关切地问：“蹩不住吧？”
      “嗯！” 周宏像碰到最亲的人那样，把这几天来的冤气都吐了出来，最后负气地说：“对这个人真没有办法！”
    李主任温和地笑了，“快不要光蹩气，劳动模范啊，可不能这样说话。”她像哄孩子一样同周宏谈了许多道理，并且表示领导上一定通过组织关系，同对方台取得联系，最后偏着脸问周宏：“真的一点办法也没有吗？琢磨琢磨吧，最困难的工作是思想工作，可也是最重要的工作哩！”
    走出了主任办公室，周宏的心里像搬掉了一块大石头，他哼着歌子回到家里，又同小弟弟玩在一起啦。玩了一阵，周宏又想着对方台的事了。对，应该想办法！
    周宏近来养成一种习惯，喜欢给自己打“？”，如今，她又开始给对方台的“32”号打“？”了，她想：这个同志的思想根源究竟在哪儿呢？她是在同我作对吗？不！她是在同工作作对。她一定还不理解，每天，从我们话务员手中，传递着多少国家大事，有多少厂矿，由于一只电话接不通，影响了工作。应该告诉她！但是怎样告诉呢？写信！人家不会笑话吗：“瞧，周宏讨饶啦！”不，不会笑话的，这是重要的思想工作哩！
    周宏给对方发出了第一封信。没有回信。工作的改进也不大。一次，周宏又给对方气得哭起来，班长连忙走过来，关怀地问：
  “又怎么啦？”周宏气愤地指着台子上闪耀的星星，说：“看，她一个劲闹别扭，电话都接不上，多痛心啊！”
    班长脸都气变了色，说：“你去歇一歇，我来替你！”
    周宏一想不对：班长上来一定同对方要闹起来，如果惊动了对方班长，“32”号的面子也下不去，便连忙擦擦眼泪，说：“我再同她打打交道！”接着她压住了火，激动地说：“同志，你对我有啥意见，空闲下来再批评吧！请你先接电话……”
    对方没有回话，但是电话马上一只一只接通了。她的心里也在激动！是的，在我们队伍里，确实还有着像“32”号这样的人，她年轻轻学到一些技术，眼睛便生到额角上去了，爱说什么，就说什么，爱干什么，就干什么，在她的心目中，重要的不是别人、整体，而是自己！但是这种人怎么能料到，偏偏还有另外一些人，而且是大多数人，像周宏那样，却在处处地方为工作着想，为别人着想，即使受了别人这么多气，还在为别人打算哩！？
    不久，对方台开始了劳动纪律的教育，“32”号受到了严格的教育。而周宏呢？又向对方发出了第二封信、第三封信，以至于第四、第五，还把过去北京台送给她的一套首都风景照片寄去，希望建立起新的友谊。
    对方台的回信来啦！据说，“32”号每接到周宏的信，总是抢着先看，然后得意地告诉大伙：“瞧，周宏又给咱们来信了！”几次感动得抽抽噎噎哭起来，说：“我有两个老师，一个是这儿的同志，一个就是周宏。”
    但是周宏并不完全知道对方的变化，只发现工作中的配合改进了，电话接通率大大提高了，对方的来信也是顶亲热的。周宏又开始进一步钻研业务，背熟地名，更好地配合对方台。
    夜里，周宏坐在接线台上，一有空闲，马上背，为了方便，还想了个办法，给它们分类，像旅顺、抚顺啦，就放在“顺”字类，还有“口”字类，“大”字类等。在周宏的红本本里，密密麻麻写着学习心得……
    1955年，周宏终于提出了上述十六个字的倡议，创造性地丰富了郭秀云工作法。
