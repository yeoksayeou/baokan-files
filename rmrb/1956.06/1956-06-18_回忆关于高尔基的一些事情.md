    Reminiscences of Gorky
    Soviet Writer Nikulin

    On Kachalyov Street in Moscow, named after the famous actor, there stands a modest two-story building. On the pediment above the front door is inscribed:
          1931—1936
                Gorky
        Resided Here
    Here, we saw and heard about the last years of Alexei Maximovich's life. Here, he conversed with outstanding Russian scientists, political figures, advanced workers and collective farm members, as well as his readers and admirers.
    Those who met Gorky for the first time felt uneasy only for the first few minutes of conversation with the great writer. Soon, Alexei Maximovich's kindness and sincerity won them over. His warm, friendly tone, and his attention to people, their lives and their work, encouraged the visitors. Gorky could get even the most reticent person to open up. People told him how they lived and worked, about the new and joyful things happening in this country that stood tall like a giant.
    Many old friends visited this house and Gorky's villa near Moscow at that time.
    Peter Andreevich Salomyov came from Gorky City. Salomyov was the prototype of Pavel Vlasov in Alexei Maximovich's novel "Mother." So they talked about old friends from Nizhny Novgorod (now Gorky City). It was very interesting to listen to them: Salomyov seemed to be able to act as a commentator on the novels "Mother" and "Foma Gordeyev."
    On Gorky's desk, side by side, lay the manuscripts of the writer's later years and his shy attempts when he first started writing prose and poetry. When you recalled your first meeting with Gorky, you would remember how happy you were to receive a letter from Alexei Maximovich, which almost always commented on your recently published works, your novels or features published in magazines.
    Once, I received a letter from Alexei Maximovich, which severely and justly criticized a new book of mine, criticizing the plot's twists and turns and the lack of narrative coherence, and finally adding touchingly, "Has this criticism offended you?" Humanity, the desire to help writers, to encourage writers not to rush, but to write more deeply and thoughtfully, that was the content of Gorky's criticism of works and manuscripts.
    Many of the books that Gorky read had markings he made with a pencil, not only thin lines and marks, but sometimes also short, strict opinions about the book. That is why Gorky's private library aroused special interest among literary critics.
    We listened breathlessly to Gorky's stories about Tolstoy, full of genuine emotion. When Gorky spoke of Tolstoy, his voice almost trembled, his eyes shining with tears, but when he recalled the lively characteristics of Leo Tolstoy's personality, a smile immediately appeared on his face.
    During the years when his health forced Gorky to live in Italy, we visited him at his residence in Sorrento, and we were always amazed at how much and how accurately Gorky knew about everything that was happening in his motherland.
    Even in Sorrento, Gorky lived with his motherland. Letters, books, newspapers, the arrival of friends, visits from Soviet sailors and Soviet diplomatic staff punctuated these days in a foreign land. Here, in this old, narrow house, there was the atmosphere of the motherland, and even its own wall newspaper, named "Sorrento Pravda," was published, for which Alexei Maximovich had written some witty sketches.
    …Gorky's working day began very early. The doorbell rang, and a postman appeared with a heavy mailbag full of letters. Inside were letters, magazines, newspapers, and mail from the Soviet Union, including not only central newspapers, but also sometimes factory tabloids. Alexei Maximovich's daily mail often filled the postman's mailbag.
    Gorky was engaged in the creation of "The Life of Klim Samgin" in Sorrento. At that time, some new characteristics appeared in his personality. We sometimes found Alexei Maximovich undergoing an inexplicable change in mood. Sometimes, he appeared among us with a somewhat stern, even melancholic look. This was during the days when he was writing "Samgin," when he described the base or cruel behavior of people, and he could not shake off the impressions he had written about for a long time. This great man had incredible sensitivity.
    That was how the days and nights in Sorrento were spent. Once, everyone finally persuaded Alexei Maximovich to recite his own short stories. He had a unique method of recitation: at first, the recitation sounded somewhat monotonous and unenthusiastic, but gradually, page by page, the listeners were drawn into the inner world of the characters in the work. I remember it was his short story "Departure," which only described the scene of fishermen returning from the Caspian Sea fishing grounds. Alexei Maximovich lowered his eyes and looked at the book, reading, but it seemed as if he was not seeing lines of words, but rather waves and the beautiful wives of the fishermen....
    Spring came, and Gorky hurried back to Moscow, where a large amount of creative work was waiting for him.
    In the hot days, Alexei Maximovich would go to live in a villa in Gorky, a scenic suburb of Moscow.
    From the veranda of the villa, Alexei Maximovich looked at the scenery of the central Russian rivers that he knew so well, and the groves of green trees on the opposite bank of the river.
    No matter where he lived, Gorky never relaxed his work for a single day. Therefore, in this villa near Moscow, a separate studio was also reserved for the writer, where he spent the last days of his life.
    Here, it seems that the atmosphere of lively and ardent thought, activity, and creative ideals is still preserved, and it seems that the voice of this great man, who was the soul of this large house, can still be heard.
    From the huge windows, you can still see the green shade of the park, and the sounds of the birds that Alexei Maximovich loved to listen to in the early morning are still chirping, and in this noisy chorus he could distinguish the voice of each little bird, and could tell his children many interesting things about these little birds.
    Gorky also received foreign guests in this house, such as Herbert Wells, the famous French political figure Edouard Herriot, and our great friend Romain Rolland.
    The few rare social evenings in Gorky's home were unforgettable, especially the one to celebrate the writer's son's birthday.
    One day, a costume party was held spontaneously here. The whole house was filled with a festive atmosphere, as Gorky was so good at creating this atmosphere easily, naturally, and in an instant. We used burnt cork and flour as costume materials, and somehow got hold of several sets of fancy dress dancing clothes. Alexei Maximovich suddenly disappeared without anyone noticing, and then suddenly appeared wearing a gorgeous oriental gown and a Turkish hat, like an Islamic religious leader in a fairy tale. And throughout the evening, he participated in games and burlesque performances with people half his age.... What a lively, life-loving person who loved good-natured jokes, even when he was already seventy years old.

    回忆关于高尔基的一些事情 
    苏联作家　尼库林
    在莫斯科的以著名演员卡查洛夫为名的大街上，有一所不大的两层楼房。在前廊门上的三角楣饰上题着：
          1931—1936年
                高尔基
        曾在这里居住
    我们在这里看到并且听到了阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇最后几年的生活情况。他在这里曾同卓越的俄国科学家、政治活动家、先进的工人和集体农庄庄员以及他的读者和尊崇他的人谈过话。
    初次看到高尔基的人，只是在同伟大的作家谈话的头几分钟感到侷促不安。很快地，阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇的好意和诚恳就征服了他们，亲切的、友爱的声调，他对人们和他们的生活和劳动的注意激励了来客。高尔基能使最不喜欢讲话的对方谈起话来。人们向他讲述他们怎样生活和工作，讲述像巨人般站起来的这个国家中所发生的新的、愉快的事情。
    许多老朋友在那个时候都访问过这所房子和莫斯科附近的高尔克的别墅。
    彼得·安得列耶维奇·萨洛莫夫从高尔基城来了，萨洛莫夫就是阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇的小说“母亲”中的巴维尔·弗拉索夫的原型。于是他们谈论着关于尼什尼诺夫哥罗得（现在的高尔基城）的老朋友，听他们谈话是非常有趣的：萨洛莫夫好像可以充当小说“母亲”和“福玛·高尔杰耶夫”的注释员。
    在高尔基的写字台上，并排放着作家晚年的手稿和他初学写散文和诗时候的羞怯的尝试。当你回忆同高尔基的初次会见的时候，你就会想起接到阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇的信时是多么快乐，在信里边差不多总是评论到你不久以前出版的著作，评论你在杂志上发表的小说或特写。
    有一次我接到阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇的一封信，信里严厉而公正地批评了我的一本新书，批评到这本书的情节的变动和缺乏叙述的严整性，最后并令人感动地附加一句：“这个批评没有得罪您吗？”人情味、帮助作家的愿望，使作家不要匆忙，而是要更深刻地、更考虑周到地去写，这就是高尔基对著作和手稿的批评的内容。
    在高尔基读过的许多书上，都留有他用铅笔画的记号，不仅有细的线条和标记，而且有时也有对这本书的简短、严格的意见。这就是为什么高尔基的私人图书馆引起文艺批评家的特别兴趣的缘故。
    我们屏住气息听了高尔基的充满真挚的激动的有关托尔斯泰的故事。高尔基在谈到托尔斯泰时，他的声音几乎颤抖了，眼睛闪着泪光，但是当他回忆起列夫·托尔斯泰性格的生气勃勃的特点的时候，他的脸上就立刻现出了微笑了。
    在健康情况使高尔基不得不住在意大利的那些年份中，我们曾在索伦多他的住所里作客，我们总是惊奇于高尔基关于祖国所发生的一切事情知道的那么多和那么准确。
    就是在索伦多，高尔基也是和祖国一同生活着。信件、书籍、报纸、朋友的到达、苏联海员和苏联外交工作人员的访问点缀了异乡的这段日子。这里，在这所古老的、狭窄的房子里有着祖国的气息，甚至还出版自己的命名为“索伦多真理报”的墙报，阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇曾为墙报写过一些风趣的小品文。
    ……高尔基的工作日开始得很早。门铃响了，出现了一个带着装满了的重邮袋的邮递员。邮袋里面有信件、杂志、报纸、苏联来的邮件，其中不仅有中央的报纸，而且有时还有工厂小报。阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇一天的邮件，常常装满了邮递员的邮袋。
    高尔基在索伦多从事“克里木·萨姆金的一生”的创作。那时，在他的性格上出现一些新的特点。我们有时发现阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇情绪上发生了一种不可解的变化。有时，他带着有点严峻、甚至是忧郁的样子在我们中间出现。这是在他写作“萨姆金”的那些日子里的事，他描写了人们的低贱的或残酷的行为，并且还长久地没有摆脱他所写的这些印象。这个伟大的人物有着不可思议的感受性。
    在索伦多的日日夜夜就是这样度过的。有一次，大家终于使阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇来朗诵了自己的短篇小说。他有一种特有的朗诵的方法：最初朗诵的声音像是有些单调、缺乏热情，但是逐渐地、一页一页地、听者就为作品中人物的内心世界所吸引了。记得这是他写的短篇小说
  “出发”，内容仅是描写渔民们从里海捕鱼场归来的情形。阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇垂下了眼睛看着书，读着，但是，好像他看到的不是一行行的字，倒是浪花和渔夫们的漂亮妻子……。
    春天来了，高尔基赶忙着回到莫斯科，那里有大量的创作工作在等他。
    在炎热的日子里，阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇就到莫斯科近郊风景区高尔克的一所别墅中去住。
    阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇从别墅的凉台上看着他所熟悉的俄罗斯中部河流的景色，以及河对岸的绿树丛。
    高尔基不论在什么地方居住都从没有一天放松过自己的工作。因此在莫斯科近郊的这个别墅中，也为作家保留了单独的工作室，他在这里度过了自己一生的最后的日子。
    在这里，好像到现在还保存着生气蓬勃的火热的思想、活动和创造性理想的气息，仿佛仍然能听到这个伟大的人的声音，这个人就是这栋大房子的灵魂。
    从巨大的窗口里仍然可以看到公园的绿荫，阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇清晨所最爱听的鸟的叫声仍然在啭鸣着，而在这个嘈杂的大合唱中他能分辨出每一个小鸟的声音，并能对自己的孩子谈到许多有关这些小鸟的最有趣的事。
    高尔基在这所房子里也接待外国贵宾，如海伯特·威尔斯，法国著名的政治活动家爱德华·赫里欧和我们的伟大朋友罗曼·罗兰。
    在高尔基家中的几个稀有的消遣晚会是令人难忘的，特别是为庆祝作家的儿子生日的那个晚会。
    有一天，这里自动地举行了化装晚会。整个房子都充满了节日的气氛，高尔基就是这样善于轻松、自然和在转瞬间创造出这种气氛。我们用烧过的软木塞和面粉作化装材料，不知从那里搞来了几套化装的跳舞衣服。阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇突然神不知鬼不觉地不见了，然后突然穿着华丽的东方长衫、戴着土耳其帽，就像童话中的伊斯兰教教主似地出现了。而在整个晚间他都参加了年龄比他小一半的人们的游戏和滑稽表演……。这是一个多么生气勃勃、热爱生活和喜欢善意玩笑的人啊，甚至当他已经七十岁的时候还是这样。
