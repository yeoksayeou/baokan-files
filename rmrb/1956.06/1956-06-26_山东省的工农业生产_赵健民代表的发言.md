    Shandong Province's Industrial and Agricultural Production
    —Speech by Delegate Zhao Jianmin
    I agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, agree with the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives and Minister Liao Luyan's explanation, and agree with Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
      An Active and Reliable National Budget
    I believe that the 1956 national budget is active, reliable, and encouraging. The 1956 budget stipulates that national economic construction expenditures account for 52.22% of the total budget expenditures, of which light industry expenditures increased by 86.14% compared with last year, agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy expenditures increased by 48.3% compared with last year, agricultural loans increased by more than double compared with last year, and scientific expenditures also increased by more than double compared with last year. Therefore, this budget is full of enthusiasm and strength for accelerating socialist construction; at the same time, it provides great support and concern for wage welfare, the improvement of people's lives, and the improvement of cultural education, which is completely in line with the needs of national socialist construction and the interests of the broad masses of people. It will encourage every Chinese person to support and realize this budget with their own active labor and strive to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.
    The Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives is concise, specific, and in line with actual conditions. The articles listed in the cooperative regulations are precisely the problems that urgently need to be followed and resolved in the current agricultural cooperativization movement. Therefore, it can be said that these cooperative regulations are timely and provide specific and clear standards for further improving advanced agricultural production cooperatives. It will play a significant role in consolidating and improving agricultural production cooperatives and developing agricultural production.
        New Upsurge in Industrial Production
    Like all parts of the country, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, Shandong has also experienced an unprecedented new upsurge in industry since last autumn, with the advent of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization. The labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and technicians has been unprecedentedly high, and socialist emulation campaigns have been widely launched. According to incomplete statistics from only five cities including Jinan, Qingdao, Zibo, Yantai, and Weifang, a total of 1,079 advanced production experiences were promoted in the first quarter of this year, and workers put forward 13,103 rationalization proposals, with an adoption rate of about 70%. At the same time, the ranks of advanced producers have been continuously expanded. In the first quarter of this year alone, 10,330 advanced producers emerged in Jinan and Qingdao. Due to the widespread development of labor emulation campaigns, the completion of the industrial production plan in the first quarter of this year was better than in the past few years. By the end of April, thirty-five enterprises had reached the 1957 production level ahead of schedule. The original plan for local industry in our province was to have a total output value of 1,696,296,000 yuan in 1957. In 1955, 1,348,600,000 yuan had been completed, accounting for 79.5% of the planned output value for 1957. It is estimated that 2,240,690,000 yuan can be completed in 1957, exceeding the original five-year plan by 32.09%. The planned output value for 1956 is 1,775,469,000 yuan. If the 1956 plan is completed, the five-year plan level can be reached more than a year ahead of schedule. Judging from the above situation, as long as we strengthen leadership and overcome complacency, it is entirely possible to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.
      Fully Exploit the Potential of Coastal Industry
      Shandong has a relatively large foundation and potential in light industry.
  Judging from our province's budget revenue in 1956, the funds accumulated through the profits and taxes of light industry account for about 65% of the total budget revenue. There is also considerable potential in the utilization rate of existing industries. For example, the equipment utilization rate of cotton spinning, cigarette, rubber shoe, burlap bag, flour, and match industries is only 20% at the lowest. In addition, raw materials for light industry such as cotton, oilseeds, salt, tobacco, fruits, and seafood are relatively abundant,
  transportation is convenient, the population is large, which can provide sufficient labor, and it is also a huge sales market, with good conditions for developing industry.
    However, because we do not have a comprehensive understanding of the significance of coastal industry in meeting the needs of the people's increasing production and life, accumulating funds, and supporting key construction, we believe that
  Shandong is located on the coast and is not a key construction area, so there is not enough courage to vigorously develop industry, and the enthusiasm is not high, resulting in slow industrial development, and even the original potential has not been effectively exploited, resulting in many industrial products still far behind the people's ever-increasing living requirements in terms of variety, quality, and quantity. We have a serious responsibility for this.
    According to the spirit of this conference, in order to effectively change the above situation, give full play to the potential strength of coastal industry, and adapt to the needs of national socialist construction and people's lives, we must raise our understanding ideologically, take active action, and bravely shoulder the glorious task of coastal support for the inland and supply for the people. We must make greater efforts to manage the existing industries conscientiously, vigorously tap potential, improve quality, increase varieties, and improve management and technical levels. We must conduct serious investigations and research, find out the situation, and according to the degree of need, the amount of investment, the situation of production, supply, and sales, and in conjunction with the planning of joint venture production reorganization, classify and rank them, and formulate a comprehensive plan for expansion, reconstruction, or new construction, which will be submitted to the Central Committee for approval and gradually implemented in a step-by-step and planned manner, to ensure that the needs of the broad masses of people's production and life are met, funds are accumulated for the country, cadres are trained, and key construction in the inland is strongly supported.
        High Tide of Agricultural Production
    In agriculture, due to the conscientious implementation of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on agricultural cooperativization, Shandong's agricultural cooperativization movement, like the rest of the country, has achieved comprehensive, rapid, and tremendous development. The number of peasant households joining agricultural production cooperatives has now reached more than 92% of the total number of peasant households, of which the number of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives accounts for 66% of the total number of peasant households in the province. Judging from the current situation, it is expected that agricultural cooperativization of a completely socialist nature can be realized throughout the province this autumn and winter.
    With the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, a new upsurge in agricultural production has also emerged. In the past, the highest winter plowing area in Shandong only reached 70% of the suitable winter plowing land. Last year, winter plowing reached more than 90% of the suitable winter plowing land, and it was generally plowed deeper and better than in previous years; from last winter to now, more than 1.5 million wells have been dug, exceeding 25% of the total number of wells dug in the past 6 years. Coupled with the construction of small reservoirs, ponds, and spring diversion and other water conservancy projects, the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 25 million mu, exceeding more than twice the original irrigated area; the management of wheat fields has also been done relatively well. Winter irrigation of wheat was rare in the past. Last year, winter irrigation reached more than 10 million mu. We estimate that the yield per unit area of wheat can increase by about 20% compared with last year, and the total output can exceed the target of the national five-year plan. According to the spring sowing situation and the current growth of seedlings, autumn grain crops can complete or overfulfill this year's agricultural production plan due to factors such as the expansion of the irrigated area, the increase in fertilizer application, the increase in the area of high-yield crops, some improvements in cultivation techniques, and the relatively even rainfall this spring.
    After agricultural cooperativization, significant changes have taken place in the growth of agricultural production. In the first three years of implementing the first five-year plan, the average annual growth rate of grain was 3%. After completing the planned targets for 1956, the growth rate of grain can increase by 13% compared with 1955. However, in the development of the movement, because our analysis of new situations and new problems was not thorough enough, our understanding was insufficient, and our leadership lagged behind the actual situation and could not keep up with the development of the movement. Therefore, many cooperatives once experienced extravagant waste; some cooperatives lacked comprehensive planning, emphasizing agricultural production while neglecting sideline production; and there are still some outstanding issues in the handling of various policy issues.
        Problems in Wheat Pre-Distribution
      Currently, wheat pre-distribution is underway in agricultural cooperatives. Because this year's wheat harvest is the first product distribution after the great development of agricultural cooperatives, cadres lack experience, and members have many concerns. Therefore, doing a good job in product distribution and correctly resolving the relationship between the state and cooperatives, cooperatives and members, and members and members is a rather arduous and complex task. In the work of wheat pre-distribution, we believe that two issues must be given special attention.
      First, the ideological issues of cooperative cadres and members. At the beginning, cooperative cadres generally resisted the principle of "less deduction and more distribution," and they planned to deduct more and distribute less. The main reason was that there was a shortage of funds in the spring, and deducting a little more would make it easier later. After we further implemented the spirit of less deduction and more distribution according to the instructions of the Central Committee, some cooperative cadres adopted the method of underestimating yields and retaining more mobile grain to achieve the purpose of more deduction. In terms of the members' ideology, there is no doubt that the cooperatives can increase production, and their concerns are: new members see that the cooperatives have indeed increased production, but they also see that the cooperatives have a lot of expenses, so some are concerned about whether they can increase their actual income; old members generally know the situation of increased production and expenses in the cooperatives, but some are afraid that more work will not result in more income; members with weak labor and less work points are concerned about getting less distribution and being afraid of starvation. That is to say, there is a contradiction in the cooperative between cadres wanting to retain more and members being afraid of getting less distribution. The solution to this problem is generally to patiently explain the consistency of collective interests and individual interests, long-term interests and current interests, so that cadres understand that if they disregard the development of cooperative production and increase public accumulation too much and too quickly, causing members to reduce their income, it will inevitably cause member dissatisfaction and affect the consolidation of the cooperative and the enthusiasm for production; to make members understand that the state and the cooperative's public accumulation are used to better develop production and create greater happiness for the people and members, and that not deducting or deducting too little is wrong. Then, on this basis, fully promote democracy, widely solicit members' opinions, and formulate a pre-distribution plan. Doing so will generally allow more than 90% of the members to increase their income.
    Second, some cooperatives did not have mature enough ideological mobilization when they were established, the policy of joining the cooperative with wheat fields was not well explained to the members, the reimbursement of the cost of wheat fields was not reasonable enough, or because the political work in the cooperative was relatively weak, some members demanded to harvest their own wheat, the cadres and members were opposed to each other, and even events such as rushing to harvest wheat occurred in individual cooperatives. The solution to this problem is generally to negotiate and reasonably resolve the cost of their wheat planting, and persuade them to agree to collective harvesting and unified distribution. For a small number of members who did not explain clearly when the cooperative was established and who firmly demand to harvest their own wheat, they can also be allowed to harvest their own wheat.
    Judging from the pilot project situation, it is generally possible to strive for more than 90% of the members to increase their income. Some places report that this year's wheat pre-distribution is "most people smile, a few people make trouble, and individuals cry," which is also somewhat representative. The so-called "making trouble" mainly refers to the members who grow their own wheat making trouble demanding to harvest it themselves; this has now been resolved, but in the future, ideological work must be strengthened regularly. The so-called "crying" mainly refers to those members who lack labor and have less income still having certain concerns. Some cooperatives' method is to re-examine the situation of the "five guarantees," and make necessary adjustments to those whose living standards are set too low; for ordinary households in difficulty who are not "five guarantee" households but have very weak labor, they adopt the method of advance payment and advance borrowing, and pay special attention to arranging appropriate farm work for them according to their labor situation in production, so that they can get a little more work points. These methods are feasible, but because the situations of ordinary households in difficulty and each cooperative are different, the handling methods must be adapted to local conditions and people, and make proper arrangements according to different situations.
           Desire for Peace
    Finally, in the 1956 budget, defense expenditures decreased by 5.52% compared with last year, and the proportion of defense expenditures in the national expenditure budget in 1956 decreased by 2.17% compared with 1955, which fully reflects our country's desire for peace and once again vividly proves that we are a peace-loving country. However, the imperialists are still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, still organizing aggressive military blocs to surround us, hindering the easing of the international situation, and sending spies to infiltrate the mainland. Therefore, we must not be paralyzed, especially Shandong, which is located on the front line of national defense, should be more vigilant. On the one hand, we should actively engage in economic construction, and on the other hand, we must always educate the people to raise their awareness of national defense, do a good job in military service mobilization, and strengthen national defense forces. If the enemy dares to take risks, we will immediately and resolutely support our People's Liberation Army and give the enemy a destructive blow.

    山东省的工农业生产
    ——赵健民代表的发言
    我同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，同意高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）及廖鲁言部长的说明，同意彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
      积极的、可靠的国家预算
    我认为1956年的国家预算是积极的、可靠的、令人鼓舞的。1956年的预算中规定国家经济建设支出占整个预算支出的52.22％，其中轻工业支出比去年增长了86.14％，农林水利支出比去年增长了48.3％，农业贷款比去年增长了一倍以上，科学事业的支出也比去年增长了一倍以上，因而这个预算充满着加速社会主义建设的热情和力量；同时对工资福利、人民生活的改善和文化教育的提高都给予了极大的支持和关怀，这完全符合于国家社会主义建设的需要和广大人民的利益的。它将鼓舞着每一个我国人民以自己的积极劳动来支持和实现这个预算，为提前和超额完成第一个五年计划而努力。
    高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）很简明、具体，并符合实际情况。社章所列各条，正是目前农业合作化运动中急待遵循解决的问题，因此说这个社章是适时的，为进一步办好高级农业生产合作社规定了具体、明确的标准。它将对农业生产合作社的巩固提高以及农业生产的发展起着重大的作用。
        工业生产的新高涨
    山东也和全国各地一样，在中央的正确领导下，自去年秋季以来，随着农业合作化高潮的到来，在工业方面也出现了前所未有的新高涨。广大职工和技术人员的劳动热情空前高涨，社会主义竞赛运动已普遍展开。仅据济南、青岛、淄博、烟台、潍坊等五个市的不完全统计，今年第一季度共推广了先进生产经验1，079种，职工提出合理化建议13，103件，采纳率在70％左右。同时不断地扩大了先进生产者的队伍，仅济南、青岛两市今年第一季度就涌现出先进生产者10，330名。由于劳动竞赛运动的普遍开展，今年第一季度工业生产计划完成的情况，比过去几年都好，到四
  月底止，已有三十五个企业提前达到了1957年的生产水平。我省地方工业原定计划1957年总产值169，629.6万元，1955年已完成134，860万元，为1957年计划产值的79.5％，预计1957年可以完成224，069万元，超过原五年计划的32.09％。1956年产值计划为177，546.9万元，如果完成1956年计划，就可以提前一年多的时间达到五年计划的水平。从以上情况看，只要我们加强领导，克服自满情绪，预计提前和超额完成五年计划是完全可能的。
      充分发挥沿海工业的潜力
      山东轻工业的基础和潜力是较大的。
  就我省1956年的预算收入来看，通过轻工业的利润和税收积累的资金，约占预算总收入的65％左右。在现有工业的利用率方面也还有不少潜力，如棉纺织、卷烟、胶鞋、麻袋、面粉、火柴的设备利用率最低的仅达到20％。此外，轻工业原料如棉花、油料、盐、烟、水果、海产等较为丰富，
  交通运输方便，人口众多，可以提供充分的劳动力，又是一个巨大的销售市场，具备着发展工业的良好条件。
    但是，由于我们对沿海工业在满足日益提高的人民生产生活需要、积累资金和支援重点建设的意义认识不够全面，认为
  山东地处沿海，不是重点建设地区，于是对大力发展工业的勇气不足，积极性不大，以致工业发展的速度迟缓，甚至原有的潜力也未能切实发挥，致使许多工业产品，在品种、质量和数量上还远跟不上人民生活日益提高的要求，这点我们是有严重责任的。
    根据此次大会精神，为了切实改变上述情况，充分发挥沿海工业的潜在力量，适应国家社会主义建设和人民生活的需要，我们要从思想上提高认识，积极行动起来，勇敢地担负起沿海支援内地和供应人民需要的光荣任务，要做更大的努力把现有的工业认真管好，并大力挖掘潜力、提高质量、增加品种、提高管理和技术水平，要认真进行调查研究，摸清情况，根据需要的程度、投资的大小、产供销的情况，并结合合营企业生产改组的规划，分类排队，拟定扩建、改建或新建的全面规划，报经中央批准，有步骤有计划的逐步实施，以保证满足广大人民生产生活的需要，为国家积累资金，培养干部，有力地支援内地重点建设。
        农业生产的高潮
    在农业方面，由于认真地执行了中共中央和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示，山东的农业合作化运动也和全国一样，获得了全面、迅速、巨大的发展。加入农业生产合作社的农户现已达到总农户的92％以上，其中加入高级社的农户占全省总农户的66％。从当前情况分析，预计今年秋冬就可在全省范围内实现完全社会主义性质的农业合作化。
    随着农业合作化运动的发展，农业生产也出现了一个新的高潮。山东过去冬耕面积最高只达到宜冬耕地的70％，去年冬耕达到宜冬耕地的90％以上，而且一般都比往年耕的深耕的好；从去年冬季到现在，已打井150余万眼，超过以往6年打井总数的25％，加上修建小型水库、塘地、引泉等水利工程，可以扩大水浇地2，500余万亩，超过原有水浇地面积的两倍以上；麦田管理工作做的也比较好，冬浇小麦过去很少，去年冬浇达到1，000余万亩，我们估计小麦单位面积产量可以比去年增产两成左右，总产量可以超过国家五年计划的指标。根据今春播种情况和当前小苗生长情况分析，秋粮作物由于水浇面积扩大、施肥量增加、高产作物面积增多、耕作技术有了一些改进，以及今春雨水比较调匀等的因素，估计可以完成或超额完成今年的农业生产计划。
    农业合作化以后，在农业生产的增长方面发生了显著的变化。我们执行第一个五年计划的前三年，粮食平均每年递增速度为3％，1956年完成预订计划后，粮食的增长速度可以比1955年增加13％。但是，在运动的发展上，由于我们对于新的情况和新的问题分析不透，认识不足，领导落后于实际，跟不上运动的发展，因此，不少的合作社曾经一度出现了铺张浪费现象；有些合作社缺乏全面规划，重视了农业生产，忽视了副业生产；在各项政策问题的处理上，也还存在着一些遗留问题。
        小麦预分中的问题
      当前，在农业合作社内正在进行小麦预分。由于今年的麦收是农业合作社大发展之后的第一次产品分配，干部缺乏经验，社员顾虑多，因此，做好产品分配，正确地解决国家与合作社、合作社与社员，以及社员与社员之间的关系问题，是一个相当艰巨而又复杂的工作。在小麦预分工作中，我们认为有两个问题必须特别的加以注意。
      第一，是社干与社员的思想问题。开始时，在社干中比较普遍地对于“少扣多分”的原则抱有抵触情绪，他们打算多扣留少分配。其原因，主要是因为春季资金困难，多扣留一点，以后少作难。我们根据中央指示进一步贯彻了少扣多分的精神以后，有的社干又采取低估产量、多留机动粮的办法达到多扣目的。在社员思想方面，对于合作社能够增产已经没有怀疑，他们的顾虑是：新社员看到合作社确实增产了，但也看到合作社开支很大，因此有的顾虑能不能增加实际收入；老社员对于社内增产与开支情况心里大体有数，但是有的怕多干不能多得；劳力弱干工少的社员顾虑分的少怕挨饿。这就是说，在合作社内存在着社干想多留，社员怕少分的矛盾。对于这个问题的解决，一般的是耐心的说明集体利益和个人利益、长远利益和当前利益的一致性，使干部了解如果不顾合作社生产的发展情况，过多过快的增加公共积累，使社员减少收入，就势必引起社员不满，影响合作社的巩固和生产积极性；使社员了解国家和合作社的公共积累，是为了用来更好地发展生产，为人民为社员创造更大的幸福，不扣或过分少扣均是不对的。然后，在此基础上充分地发扬民主，广泛地征求社员意见，制定预分方案。这样做，一般的都可能争取90％以上的社员增加收入。
    第二，是部分合作社由于建社时思想发动的不够成熟，麦田入社的政策没有向社员很好的交代，偿还麦田工本费不够合理，或者由于社内政治工作比较薄弱，有些社员要求自己收割小麦、干部与社员对立，甚至在个别社内出现抢收小麦等的事件。对于这一问题的解决，一般是经过协商，合理解决了他们种麦时的工本费用，说服其同意集体收割，统一分配。对于少数建社时就未讲清，而又坚决要求自己收割的社员，则也可以同意他自己收割。
    就试点情况看来，一般都可能争取90％以上的社员增加收入。有些地方反映，今年小麦预分是“多数笑、少数闹、个别哭”，这个反映也有一定的代表性。所谓“闹”，主要是自种小麦的社员闹着要求自收；现在已经解决了，但今后还须经常地加强思想工作。所谓“哭”，主要是那些劳力缺乏、收入较少的社员还存在一定顾虑。有些合作社的办法是：重新检查了“五保”的情况，生活标准订的偏低者作了必要的调整；对于不属“五保”户而劳力很弱的一般困难户，采取了预支预借的办法，并在生产方面特别注意了根据其劳力情况安排他们适当的农活，使他们多得一点工分。这些办法都是可行的，但由于一般困难户和各个合作社的情况各不相同，因此，在处理办法上必须是因地因人制宜，根据不同的情况进行妥善安排。
           和平的愿望
    最后，在1956年的预算中，国防经费比去年减少了5.52％，1956年国防费，在国家支出预算中所占的比重，比1955年下降2.17％，这充分反映了我国的和平愿望，再一次生动地证明了我们是一个爱好和平的国家。但是，帝国主义者仍在侵占着我国的领土台湾，仍在组织侵略性军事集团包围我们，阻挠国际局势的缓和，并派遣特务潜入大陆。因此，我们决不能麻痹，特别是山东地处国防前线，尤应提高警惕，一方面积极地从事经济建设，另一方面必须时时教育人民提高国防观念，做好兵役动员工作，加强国防力量，如果敌人敢于冒险，我们则立即全力坚决的支援我人民解放军，予敌人以歼灭性的打击。
