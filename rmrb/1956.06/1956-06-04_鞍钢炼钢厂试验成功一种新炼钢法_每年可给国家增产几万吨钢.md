Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd - A new steelmaking method - "slag formation in the early melting stage" - has been successfully tested at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant. This new steelmaking method can shorten the melting time of each furnace by more than 20 minutes. If this method is promoted only in this steelmaking plant, it can increase the country's steel production by tens of thousands of tons per year.

In the past, they used the "slag formation in the early refining stage" method for steelmaking. This method had a short melting time but a long refining time. This plant also used the "slag formation in the late melting stage" steelmaking method. This shortened the refining time, but lengthened the melting time. Both methods prevented the steelmaking process from being shortened quickly. Zeng Yangqing, the director of the steelmaking plant, based on his experience gained during his internship in the Soviet Union and his years of practical operation, observation, and research in the plant, wanted to find a steelmaking method that could both avoid extending the melting time and shorten the refining time. Therefore, he boldly proposed the suggestion of "slag formation in the early melting stage."

From May 7th to June 2nd, the steelmaking plant used this new steelmaking method to smelt more than 40 furnaces of steel on several different open-hearth furnaces. According to preliminary statistics, the new method can shorten the time per furnace by up to 53 minutes and at least 16 minutes compared to the old method on large open-hearth furnaces. Workers on the Youth Friendship Furnace used this new steelmaking method to create a new fast steelmaking record of smelting one furnace of steel in 5 hours and 45 minutes.

Using this steelmaking method can also improve the quality of the steel and extend the life of the open-hearth furnace body.

    鞍钢炼钢厂试验成功一种新炼钢法
    每年可给国家增产几万吨钢
    新华社鞍山3日电　一种新的炼钢方法——“熔化初期就造渣”，已经在鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂试验成功。这项新炼钢方法能使每炼一炉钢的熔炼时间缩短二十分钟以上。仅在这个炼钢厂推广这个方法，每年就可以给国家增产几万吨钢。
    过去他们是用“精炼初期造渣”的方法来炼钢。这种方法，熔化时间短，但是精炼时间长。这个厂也曾经用过“熔化末期造渣”的炼钢方法。这样精炼的时间短了，但熔化的时间延长了。这两种方法都使炼钢的过程不能很快缩短。炼钢厂的厂长曾扬清根据他在苏联实习期间学习来的经验，和几年来在厂里的实际操作、观察研究，想找出既可以不延长熔化时间，又可以缩短精炼时间的炼钢方法。这样，他就大胆地提出在“熔化初期就造渣”的建议。
    从五月七日开始到六月二日，炼钢厂在几种不同的平炉上用这种新的炼钢方法先后炼了四十多炉钢。根据初步统计，大型平炉用新法比老法每炼一炉钢的时间，最高可以缩短五十三分钟，最少也能缩短十六分钟。青年友谊炉工人用这种新的炼钢方法，曾经创造过五点四十五分钟炼一炉钢的快速炼钢新纪录。
    用这种炼钢方法还能提高钢的质量，延长平炉炉体的寿命。
