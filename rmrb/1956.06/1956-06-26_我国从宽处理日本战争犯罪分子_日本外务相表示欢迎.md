Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 25th: Tokyo Radio broadcast that Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu told reporters yesterday, "China's recent release of Japanese war criminals is a very welcome matter."

Shigemitsu interpreted this action as a sign that China's attitude towards Japan has gradually softened, and said that the Japanese government is prepared to expand trade with China as much as possible within the limits of "not violating international trust." However, he reiterated that because Japan recognizes the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it cannot recognize China at present.

    我国从宽处理日本战争犯罪分子
    日本外务相表示欢迎
    新华社25日讯　东京电台广播：日本外务相重光葵昨天向记者说：“最近中国释放了日本战犯，这是令人感到非常高兴的事情。”
    重光把这一行动解释作中国对日本的态度已经逐渐缓和下来的表现，并且说，日本政府准备在“不违背国际信义”的范围内，尽量扩大同中国的贸易。但是，他再一次表示，因为日本承认蒋介石集团，现在不能承认中国。
