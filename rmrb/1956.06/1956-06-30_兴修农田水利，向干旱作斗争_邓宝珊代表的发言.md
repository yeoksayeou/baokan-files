Undertake Farmland Irrigation and Water Conservancy, Fight Against Drought
--Speech by Representative Deng Baoshan

I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I will briefly talk about the situation of farmland irrigation and water conservancy work in Gansu Province in the past six months.

    Gansu has always been threatened by drought, and undertaking farmland irrigation and water conservancy is of particular importance
Gansu Province's agricultural production has always been seriously threatened by drought. Therefore, undertaking farmland irrigation and water conservancy to transform dry land into irrigated land is of particular importance. Before liberation, there was very little irrigated land in the province, only more than 6.43 million mu, and some places did not even have one mu of irrigated land. In the past, some people thought that this was because Gansu lacked water and there was no prospect for the development of water conservancy. This statement does not conform to the facts. Gansu Province not only has many large and small rivers, but also abundant groundwater; even if the rainfall is relatively small, as long as loss is prevented, drought can also be alleviated. It should be said that the potential strength in water conservancy is not small, but because the social system before liberation was extremely unreasonable, the masses could not utilize it. Since liberation, Gansu's farmland irrigation and water conservancy, especially the mass-based small-scale water conservancy, have been significantly developed. From 1950 to 1955, the province added more than 3.57 million mu of irrigated land, equivalent to 55% of the area of irrigated land built in the past many years. The contrast between the past and the present is a vivid illustration.

    The agricultural cooperation movement opened up a new situation for Gansu's water conservancy work
However, before the autumn harvest of 1955, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives in the province only accounted for 9.8% of the total number of peasant households, and the small-peasant economy still occupied a large advantage in the countryside. Under such circumstances, due to the many conflicts of interest among individual farmers, coupled with insufficient labor and capital, the development of water conservancy work was still greatly restricted. Since studying Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperation and criticizing right-leaning conservative thought, especially the "Gansu is backward" theory, a high tide has appeared in the agricultural cooperation movement in the province. By the end of February this year, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives had accounted for 89.8% of the total number of peasant households, of which the number of peasant households participating in advanced cooperatives accounted for 22.8% of the total number of peasant households. In a short period of time, the vast countryside has undergone fundamental changes. This change, coupled with the promulgation of the draft National Program for Agricultural Development, has opened up a new situation for Gansu's water conservancy work. The organized peasants have rushed to repair canals, dig wells, dredge springs, build dams, dig waterlogged ponds, and build water cellars, setting off a wave of farmland irrigation and water conservancy construction. By the end of May, the newly built various water conservancy facilities, if fully utilized, could irrigate more than 5 million mu of land. In the most arid Dingxi area, due to the large increase in irrigated land, 10% of the townships have been able to get rid of the threat of general drought. Yangwa Yao in Gaolan County was originally an arid and poor small village. In the past, there was no irrigated land, and it suffered from drought year after year. The masses suffered from food and clothing shortages and relied on relief to survive. Now, the entire village has built more than 690 mu of irrigated land, with an average of 2.3 mu per person, and the drought phenomenon has been significantly changed. In previous years, whenever spring and summer came, some farmers would always come to Lanzhou because their land was too dry to plant and they had no work to do in the countryside. This phenomenon has basically disappeared this year. This is also greatly related to the development of water conservancy after cooperation.

Scale, scope, speed, quality and creation
    are the characteristics of Gansu's farmland irrigation and water conservancy
Generally speaking, the characteristics of Gansu's farmland irrigation and water conservancy work this year are large scale, wide scope, fast progress, good quality, and many creations. According to preliminary statistics, about 1.5 million people in the province participated in water conservancy construction. In addition to male and female farmers, there were also technical personnel, craftsmen, primary school teachers, and even some old gentlemen and individual counselors of the Provincial People's Committee, who enthusiastically helped the masses with water conservancy technology and experience. The scope of water conservancy construction covers the entire province. Even Huichuan and other counties that have never had irrigated land have begun to build a lot of irrigated land this year. In terms of progress, it is much faster than in the past. For example, Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County built 140,000 mu of irrigated land in 4 days. In general, the quality of the newly built water conservancy projects has been improved. In particular, the construction of all these water conservancy projects mainly relies on the strength of the masses themselves. Even some of the larger projects are the same, which greatly saves national investment. In the farmland irrigation and water conservancy movement, the broad masses have brought into play their rich wisdom. Some have come up with many methods, such as Huichuan County, which has created 6 kinds of irrigation methods that can be used to irrigate farmland on the mountains; some have created many tools and simple instruments that can save manpower and improve efficiency, or can be used to lift water; these tools and instruments are adapted to local conditions, simple in structure, low in cost, easy to manufacture, and convenient to use, and are very popular among the masses. Many grass-roots cadres and farmers have learned simple water conservancy technology through practice and research. 64% of the district and township cadres in Yuzhong County have learned simple technology for repairing general small-scale water conservancy projects. In this way, the shortage of technical forces has been made up to a considerable extent, and at the same time, water conservancy technicians have been deeply educated, making them further realize that science and technology must be combined with the masses to play their due role.

    Believing in the masses and relying on the masses is the most basic experience in our work
In the past six months, the most basic experience in our farmland irrigation and water conservancy work is that we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. We were not ignorant of this point in the past, but we have not understood it as deeply as we do today. On the one hand, this is because in the past, under the circumstances of the small-peasant economy, the strength of the masses could not be fully expressed; on the other hand, it is also because we have always been accustomed to treating rural affairs with the eyes of the small-peasant economy, and we often underestimate the potential strength among the peasants. And in the first year of realizing agricultural cooperation, the masses used collective wisdom and strength to build more than 5 million mu of irrigated land, which greatly exceeded the total area of irrigated land built in the previous 6 years. This is indeed a great inspiration and education for us.

    We still have shortcomings and errors in our water conservancy work
However, we still have many shortcomings and errors in our water conservancy work. For example, some projects cannot be used now because of the lack of water lifting tools or poor quality; some places have been too impatient, the work has been arranged too tightly, the working hours have been too long, and the masses have been too tired; there has also been insufficient care for women; in particular, a few places have not paid attention to construction safety, resulting in casualties. The most serious incident was that the canal collapsed in the Sangqu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tianshui County in February this year, resulting in 10 casualties in one incident. We must learn from these shortcomings and errors and earnestly improve our future work. We must never become complacent because we have achieved results. Any complacency will only cause losses to our cause.

Gansu is a new industrial construction area. In recent years, all parts of the country have provided great help to Gansu's construction cause in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources. The rapid development of the construction cause in Gansu is inseparable from the enthusiastic concern and strong support from all parts of the country. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the people of Gansu. However, we have not taken good care of the staff and workers who have come to work in Gansu in various aspects in the past, and we have not solved some of their practical difficulties in a timely manner. This is what we should pay attention to improving. We hope that all parts of the country will continue to give us more help in all aspects in the future so that we can better undertake the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the country.

    兴修农田水利，向干旱作斗争
    ——邓宝珊代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长的报告。现在，我简单地讲一讲最近半年来甘肃省农田水利工作的情况。
      甘肃一向受干旱威胁，兴修农田
    水利有特别重要意义
    甘肃省的农业生产，一向受到干旱的严重威胁，因此，兴修农田水利，变旱地为水地，就有特别重要的意义。解放前，全省水地很少，只有643万多亩，有些地方连一亩水地也没有。过去有人以为这是甘肃缺水，水利没有发展前途的缘故，这种说法是不符合事实的。甘肃境内不但有许多大小河流，而且有丰富的地下水；就是雨水虽然比较少，只要防止流失，也还可以减轻干旱。应该说，水利方面的潜在力量是不小的，只是因为解放前的社会制度极不合理，群众无法利用而已。解放以来，甘肃的农田水利，特别是群众性的小型水利，就得到显著的发展。从1950年到1955年，全省共增加水地357万多亩，相当于过去多少年间所修水地面积的55％。前后对比，就是一个生动的说明。
      农业合作化运动给甘肃的水利工
    作打开了新的局面
    但是在1955年秋收以前，全省参加农业生产合作社的农户，只占总农户数的9.8％，小农经济在农村还占有很大优势。在那样情况下，由于个体农民之间利害矛盾很多，再加劳动力和资金不足，水利工作的发展还是受到很大限制。自从学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告，批判了右倾保守思想特别是“甘肃落后论”之后，全省农业合作化运动就出现了高潮。到今年2月底，参加农业生产合作社的农户，已经占总农户数的89.8％，其中参加高级社的农户占总农户数的22.8％。在短短期间，广大农村就起了根本变化。这个变化，再加全国农业发展纲要草案的公布，给甘肃的水利工作打开了一个新的局面。组织起来的农民，纷纷修渠、打井、掏泉、筑坝、挖涝池、打水窖，掀起了兴修水利的热潮。到5月底，新修的各种水利设施，如果全部利用起来，可以浇地500多万亩。在最干旱的定西专区，由于水地大量增加，已经有10％的乡可以摆脱一般的旱灾威胁。皋兰县的阳洼窑，本来是一个干旱贫苦的小村子，过去没有水地，连年遭受旱灾，群众少吃缺穿，靠救济度日，现在全村已经修了690多亩水地，每人平均有2亩3分，干旱现象有了显著改变。往年每当春夏的时候，总有些农民因为地旱种不上，在农村没活干，流到兰州市来，今年这种现象已经基本上消失了。这同合作化以后水利的发展也是有很大关系的。
    规模大、范围广、进度快、质量好、
  创造多，是甘肃农田水利工作的特点
    今年甘肃农田水利工作的特点，总的来说，是规模大、范围广、进度快、质量好、创造多。据初步统计，全省参加修水利的约有150多万人，其中除了男女农民以外，还有技术人员、手工业者、小学教师，连有的老先生和省人民委员会的个别参事，也在水利技术上和经验方面热心地帮助群众。修水利的范围遍及全省，就是从来没有水地的会川等县，今年也开始修了许多水地。在进度上，比以往要快得多，像张家川回族自治县4天就修了14万亩水地。一般新修的水利，质量都有提高。特别是所有这些水利的兴修，主要依靠群众自己的力量，即使某些比较大的工程也是如此，这就大大节省了国家投资。在兴修水利运动中，广大群众发挥了丰富的智慧，有的想出了许多办法，像会川县创造了6种灌溉法，可以用来灌溉山上的耕地；有的创造了许多工具和简单的仪器，可以节省人力，提高效率，或者可以用来提水；这些工具和仪器都是因地制宜，构造简单，成本很低，制作容易，使用方便，很受群众欢迎。许多基层干部和农民，经过实践和钻研，学会了简单的水利技术；榆中县区乡干部中有64％的人已经懂得修一般小型水利的简单技术。这样，就在相当程度上弥补了技术力量的不足，同时也给水利技术人员以深刻的教育，使他们进一步认识到科学技术必须与群众相结合，才能发挥应有的作用。
      相信群众，依靠群众是我们工作
    中的最基本的经验
    半年来，我们在农田水利工作中的一条最基本的经验，就是必须相信群众，依靠群众，发挥群众的积极性和创造性。关于这一点，我们过去并不是不知道的，可是体会得就没有今天这样深刻。这一方面因为过去是在小农经济的情况下，群众的力量不能充分地表现出来；另一方面，也是因为我们一向习惯于用小农经济的眼光去对待农村的事物，对于农民中间的潜在力量往往是估计不足的。而就在实现农业合作化的第一个年头，群众用集体智慧和力量修了500多万亩水地，大大超过了以往6年所修水地的总面积，这对于我们来说，确是很大的启发和教育。
    我们在水利工作中还有缺点和错误
    不过，我们在水利工作中的缺点和错误，还是不少的。例如有一部分工程，因为提水工具缺乏或者质量不好，现在还不能利用；有些地方要求过急，工作安排过紧，劳动时间过长，群众过于疲劳；对于妇女也是照顾不够；尤其是有少数地方不注意施工安全，以致发生伤亡事故，最严重的是天水县桑渠村农业生产合作社在今年2月发生渠道塌陷，一次伤亡10人。我们必须从这些缺点和错误中取得教训，并且切实改进今后的工作，绝不能因为有了成绩就可以自满起来。任何自满，只会使我们的事业遭受损失。
    甘肃是一个新的工业建设地区。几年来，全国各地对于甘肃的建设事业，不论在人力、物力和财力方面，帮助是很大的。甘肃地区的建设事业能够得到迅速发展，是同全国各地的热情关怀和有力支持分不开的。这里，我代表甘肃人民表示衷心的感谢。可是，我们以往对于到甘肃来工作的职工同志在各方面照顾得不够周到，对于他们的一些实际困难，也没有及时加以解决，这是我们应当注意改进的。希望全国各地今后继续从各方面给我们以更多的帮助，使我们能够更好地担当起国家交给我们的光荣任务。
