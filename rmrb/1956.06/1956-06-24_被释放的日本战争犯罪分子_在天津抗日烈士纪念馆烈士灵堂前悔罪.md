Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 23rd: The first group of released Japanese war criminals gathered in Tianjin went to the Anti-Japanese Martyrs Memorial Hall today to present wreaths to the Chinese Anti-Japanese Martyrs and express their condolences.

Their eight representatives carried four wreaths and laid them before the spirits of the Anti-Japanese Martyrs. Afterwards, they stood before the hall and paid silent tribute to the Anti-Japanese Martyrs.

Former Japanese Army Private First Class, Kunitomo Shuntaro, delivered a memorial speech on behalf of the 335 released Japanese war criminals before the Anti-Japanese Martyrs Hall. He said: "We now swear before your spirits: We will never again take the path of past sins, we will never allow cruel and inhumane wars of aggression to appear again in human history, we firmly oppose wars of aggression, and we will fight for lasting peace and the eternal unity of the Chinese and Japanese people."

In front of the hall, many people were filled with tears. Former Japanese Army Private First Class, Maruya Chuzo, trembling, took off his hat and wept bitterly, saying, "I want to dedicate my entire life to the cause of peace." Former Japanese Army Corporal, Mukai Hatsukazu, said before the Martyrs' Hall: "I will fight to the end for the path of peace, for the path of happiness." After saying this, he also sobbed uncontrollably.

The Anti-Japanese Martyrs Memorial Hall houses the ashes of 2,546 Chinese Anti-Japanese Martyrs transported back from Japan, from places like Hanaoka and Hokkaido. They were all captured by Japanese imperialism and died as forced laborers in Japan.

    据新华社天津23日电　集结在天津的第一批被释放的日本战争犯罪分子，今天到抗日烈士纪念馆向中国抗日烈士献花圈致哀。
    他们的八名代表抬着四个花圈献在抗日烈士的灵前。随后，他们站在灵堂前向抗日烈士默哀致敬。
    前日本陆军兵长国友俊太郎代表335名被释放回国的日本战争犯罪分子，在抗日烈士灵堂前致悼词。他说：“我们现在在你们的灵前宣誓：我们决不再走过去的罪恶道路，我们决不容许残酷的、非人道的侵略战争再在人类历史上出现，我们坚决反对侵略战争，我们要为持久和平和中日两国人民永远团结而奋斗。”
    在灵堂前，很多人眼泪满眶。前日本陆军兵长丸谷忠三用颤抖的手脱下帽子，痛哭流涕，他说：“我要把自己的整个生命贡献给和平事业。”前日本陆军伍长向井初一在烈士灵堂前说：“我要为了和平的道路、为了幸福的道路奋斗到底。”他说罢，也泣不成声。
    抗日烈士纪念馆安放着由日本花岗、北海道等地运回的2，546名中国抗日殉难烈士的骨灰，他们都是日本帝国主义俘去日本作苦工而死去的。
