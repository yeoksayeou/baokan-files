Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 20th: On the afternoon of June 19th, at 5 PM, eighty thousand Muscovites held a grand rally at the "Dynamo" Central Stadium. They warmly met with Yugoslav President Tito and his entourage and enthusiastically celebrated the development of friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

	Khrushchev and Tito spoke at the meeting. Their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by applause.

	Khrushchev's Speech

	Khrushchev said that this rally is being held as the fruitful Soviet-Yugoslav talks are concluding, and as Comrade Tito, the President of Yugoslavia, and his friends are about to conclude their visit to the Soviet Union. It can be said that our talks were cordial and very frank.

	Khrushchev then pointed out that certain politicians in Western countries are uneasy about the restoration of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. He said that we can tell them: Gentlemen, if you are worried that our friendship will harm other countries, then we can guarantee that we do not want to do so. We hope that the good relations that Yugoslavia has formed with other countries can continue to develop. The Soviet Union is not only willing to develop and consolidate friendly relations with Yugoslavia but also with all countries.

	Speaking about the relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Khrushchev said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed in the past and still believes now that it is necessary not only to strive to develop economic, cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, but also to have active contacts and cooperation between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

	We believe that cooperation between our two parties is of great significance for the further smooth development of state relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Having exchanged views, specific forms of cooperation between our two parties have now been determined, which will make it possible to exchange socialist experiences more deeply and comprehensively, and to work together for the development of the international workers' movement and for socialism.

	The basis of unity between our two parties lies in the fact that each party adheres to a revolutionary stance, is guided by the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and creatively applies this doctrine according to the characteristics of its own country. It is quite natural and reasonable that there will be no issues between our two parties that cannot be agreed upon. Even if there are any differences between us, these differences and misunderstandings can be quickly overcome due to the unity in the main and fundamental aspects. This is also understandable.

	After recounting the traditional friendship between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples, Khrushchev said that the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government took resolute steps last year to improve Soviet-Yugoslav relations, which were damaged in 1948. Now, we have the right to say that in the past year, great achievements have been made in developing Soviet-Yugoslav friendly cooperation and in strengthening ties in economic, cultural, scientific, technological, and other fields. We have every reason to say that the Soviet Union is a loyal and faithful friend of Yugoslavia, and our people warmly wish the Yugoslav people, who are building socialism, success. All the people's democracies are also friends of Yugoslavia, and these countries, like the Soviet Union, hope that the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, as a socialist worker-peasant state, will increasingly develop and consolidate.

	Khrushchev emphasized that the attitude of the Soviet Union and all the people's democracies towards Yugoslavia is fundamentally different from the attitude of some capitalist countries that boast about their "friendship" with Yugoslavia. He said that the "friendship" of capitalist countries towards Yugoslavia starts from the hope that a conflict will occur between us; they hope that this conflict will prompt Yugoslavia to deviate from the path of socialism; they hope that capitalist factors will greatly develop and strengthen in Yugoslavia, and finally lead Yugoslavia back to the path of capitalist development. Our friendship with Yugoslavia, on the other hand, is based on the great socialist principles, on complete equality, on respect for the sovereignty of each country, and on the mutual support of countries that are building socialism and are unswervingly fighting for world peace. The unity of goals and mutual cooperation in achieving this goal is the source of the fraternal friendship of socialist countries.

	Khrushchev said that the enemies of peace and socialism especially hoped that a conflict would occur between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, thinking that they could incite hostility between our two peoples. They bluntly said that everything that happened in the relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union could also happen in the relations between other socialist countries. They vainly attempted not only to bring Yugoslavia back into the embrace of capitalism but also to bring other socialist countries back into the embrace of capitalism. However, the enemy's plans have failed.

	People's China once occupied a special place in the imperialists' plans. They believed that after the deterioration of relations between us and Yugoslavia, People's China might break away from the socialist camp and embark on the path of capitalist development. In order to find a basis for this absurd idea, bourgeois hacks have spent countless ink in the past and present! Khrushchev emphasized that they will never understand that no force can destroy the fraternal friendship of our peoples, which is the source of our strength.

	Therefore, our party has done everything possible, and will continue to do everything possible, to develop and consolidate the friendship of the workers' parties of all countries. In the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the task of establishing contact with the workers' parties of all countries was put forward. In carrying out this task, our party will strive to establish contact with the workers' parties of other countries in order to achieve a deep understanding of each other. We know that there are still many principled political differences between these parties and among communists. However, we also know that our views are similar on many issues, especially on such important issues as striving for peace, easing international tensions, and establishing friendly relations between countries.

	Tito's Speech

	Then, Yugoslav President Tito spoke at the rally. He said that Comrade Khrushchev has already mentioned what factors bring us closer to each other and what factors require us to cooperate and move forward together in socialist construction, and I certainly agree with this completely. But on the other hand, this by no means means that Yugoslavia now wants to undermine its relations with other countries, because this is contrary to the principles of our foreign policy. If someone does not like Yugoslavia's friendship with the Soviet Union, that is another matter. In this regard, we cannot help such people.

	Tito believes that the speculations and comments of some Western newspapers on their visit to the Soviet Union are malicious and distorted talks. He said that this visit is a logical continuation of our foreign policy of striving for cooperation with all countries willing to cooperate on an equal footing, and also a reflection of our efforts to further promote international cooperation and consolidate world peace. Our desire is a reflection of the desire of our people, and we are willing to maintain the best possible friendly relations and cooperation with this great socialist country.

	Speaking of his talks with the Soviet leaders, Tito said that in addition to some national issues, that is, issues that are of interest to both our countries, and some international issues, we also exchanged views with the Soviet leaders on party issues. Because it is clear that we must find the most suitable forms for expanding and consolidating our cooperation and for cooperation between the world working class and other progressive movements.

	Tito said that Yugoslavia is moving forward along the road of socialist construction, and it will continue to move forward along this road with confidence in the future. He said that Yugoslavia's path is somewhat different from the path taken by the Soviet Union, but the goals of the two countries in reaching socialism are the same. Differences in methods should not and cannot hinder close cooperation between countries building socialism.

	Tito emphasized that we came to visit at the invitation of the Soviet leaders, not as a courtesy visit, but as a visit made after the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have done a lot of effective work in the past year, which has made it possible to strengthen the friendly relations and comprehensive cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

	We have exchanged views with your leaders on many, many issues, and I can say that in these conversations, we easily found common ground and achieved mutual understanding. In these conversations, we deeply felt that your leaders, like us, are primarily concerned about the cause of maintaining peace, and they firmly hope to resolve various international issues through peaceful means.

	Tito then spent a lot of time talking about the German issue, the European security issue, and some other international issues. Speaking of the United Nations, he said that although the United Nations has been playing a huge role in some international issues, this organization does not yet have an all-encompassing nature. He believes that it is an abnormal fact that a large country like the People's Republic of China has not been able to enter the United Nations, and that many other countries have not joined the United Nations. He said, "I believe that the issue of admitting China and other countries into the United Nations will be resolved soon."

	Tito also talked about the issue of peaceful coexistence between countries and peoples with different social systems. Tito emphasized that there are currently two main systems in the world—the socialist system and the capitalist system. However, this by no means means that there cannot be constructive cooperation between these two systems on all issues of concern to the people of various countries.

	At the end of Tito's speech, the audience once again cheered for the friendship between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples, and issued stormy shouts of "Hurrah!"

	Afterwards, the guests watched the races and exciting football matches held on the field.

    莫斯科举行大会祝贺苏南友好合作的发展
    据新华社莫斯科20日电　六月十九日下午五时，八万莫斯科人在“狄纳莫”中央运动场举行了盛大的集会。他们同南斯拉夫总统铁托和他的随行人员亲切地见了面，并且热烈祝贺苏联和南斯拉夫的友好合作的发展。
    赫鲁晓夫和铁托先后在会上讲了话。他们的讲话不止一次地被掌声打断。
  赫鲁晓夫的讲话
    赫鲁晓夫说，当富有成果的苏南会谈结束的时候，当南斯拉夫总统铁托同志和他的朋友们就要结束在苏联的访问的时候，我们来举行这次大会。可以说，我们的会谈是亲切的和非常坦率的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，西方国家的某些政治家对苏南两国之间友好关系的恢复感到不安。他说，对于这一点，我们可以告诉他们：先生们，如果你们担心我们的友谊会使别的国家受到损害，那末，可以担保，我们是不愿意这样做的。我们希望南斯拉夫同其他国家形成的良好关系能够继续发展。苏联这方面不仅愿意同南斯拉夫，而且愿意同一切国家发展和巩固彼此之间的友好关系。
    在谈到苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的关系的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联共产党过去和现在都认为，不仅必须努力发展苏联和南斯拉夫间的经济、文化和科学技术合作，而且必须使苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间有活跃的联系和合作。
    我们相信，我们两党之间的合作对进一步顺利发展苏南两国之间的国家关系有非常重要的意义。由于彼此交换了意见，现在已经确定了我们两党间合作的具体形式，这就有可能更深刻地、更全面地交流社会主义的经验，共同为国际工人运动的发展，为社会主义而努力。
    我们两党一致的基础就在于：每个党都坚持革命立场，以马克思列宁主义学说为指导思想，按照各自国家的特点而创造性地运用这种学说。我们两党之间不会有无法达成协议的问题，这是十分自然的，合情合理的。即使彼此之间发生什么膈膜，但是由于在主要的、基本的方面的一致，这些膈膜和误解是可以很快克服的。这也是可以理解的。
    赫鲁晓夫在追述了苏南两国人民的传统友谊之后说，苏共中央和苏联政府去年采取了坚决的步骤，来改善在1948年遭到破坏的苏南关系。现在，我们有权利说，在过去一年中，在发展苏南友好合作，在加强经济、文化、科学、技术和其他方面的联系上已经取得了巨大的成就。我们完全有理由说，苏联是南斯拉夫忠诚的和忠实的朋友，我国人民热烈愿望正在建设社会主义的南斯拉夫人民获得成功。所有的人民民主国家也都是南斯拉夫的朋友，这些国家像苏联一样，希望作为社会主义工农国家的南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国日益发展和巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联和所有的人民民主国家对南斯拉夫的态度同某些大肆吹嘘对南斯拉夫的“友谊”的资本主义国家的态度是有原则性的区别的。他说，资本主义国家对南斯拉夫的“友谊”是从希望我们之间发生冲突这一点出发的，它们希望这种冲突会促使南斯拉夫脱离社会主义的道路；希望资本主义因素在南斯拉夫大大发展和加强，而最后使南斯拉夫回到资本主义的发展道路。而我们同南斯拉夫的友谊是以伟大的社会主义原则为基础的，是以完全平等、尊重每一个国家的主权为基础的，是以建设社会主义的、坚定不移的为世界和平而斗争的国家的相互支持为基础的。目标的一致、在达到这个目标中的相互合作是社会主义国家兄弟友谊的泉源。
    赫鲁晓夫说，和平和社会主义的敌人特别希望苏联和南斯拉夫发生冲突，以为能够在我们两国人民之间煽动敌意。他们露骨地说，南斯拉夫和苏联之间的关系中所发生过的一切，在其他社会主义国家之间的关系中也可能发生。他们妄图不仅使南斯拉夫重新回到资本主义怀抱，而且妄图使其他社会主义国家重新回到资本主义怀抱。但是，敌人的打算落空了。
    人民中国在帝国主义者的计划中曾经占有特别的地位，他们认为，在我们和南斯拉夫的关系恶化以后，人民中国有可能脱离社会主义阵营，而走上资本主义发展的道路。为了给这种妄诞的想法找根据，资产阶级的下流文人过去和现在不知花费
  了多少笔墨！赫鲁晓夫强调说，他们永远也不会懂得，任何力量也不能破坏我们各国人民兄弟般的友谊，这友谊是我们力量的源泉。
      因此，我们党尽了一切力量，而且今后还要尽一切力量来发展和巩固各国工人阶级政党的友谊。在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议中，提出了同各国工人阶级政党建立接触的任务。我们党在执行这一任务的时候，将力求和其他国家的工人阶级政党建立接触，求得互相深刻的了解。我们知道，在这些政党之间和在共产主义者之间还存在着许多原则上的政治分歧。但是，我们也知道，在不少的问题上我们的观点是相近的，特别是在像争取和平、缓和国际紧张局势、建立各国间的友好关系这样一些十分重要的问题上。
    铁托的讲话
    接着，南斯拉夫总统铁托在大会上讲了话。他说，赫鲁晓夫同志已经提到，是什么样的因素使我们彼此接近，是什么因素要求我们在社会主义建设中合作和共同前进，我当然完全同意这一点。但另一方面，这决不意味着南斯拉夫现在想破坏自己同其他国家的关系，因为这是违背我们的外交政策的原则的。要是有人不喜欢南斯拉夫同苏联的友谊，那就是另一回事了。在这方面我们对这种人是无法帮忙的。
    铁托认为，某些西方报纸对他们这次到苏联的访问的揣测和评论，是一种恶意和歪曲的谈论。他说，这次访问是我们争取同一切愿意合作的国家，在平等的基础上实行合作的外交政策的逻辑的继续，也是我们为更进一步促进国际合作和巩固世界和平所作的努力的反映。我们的愿望是我国人民愿望的反映，我们愿意同这个伟大的社会主义国家保持尽可能好的友好联系和合作。
    在谈到他同苏联领导人的会谈时，铁托说，我们除了一些国家问题，也就是那些我们两国都感兴趣的问题和某些国际问题以外，还就党的问题同苏联的领导人交换了意见。因为很显然，我们必须找到最适合于扩大和巩固我们的合作，适合于世界工人阶级的和其他进步运动实行合作的形式。
    铁托说，南斯拉夫正在沿着社会主义建设的道路前进，它将来也要满怀信心地继续沿着这条道路前进。他说，南斯拉夫的道路和苏联所走的道路有些不同，但是两国达到社会主义的目的是一样的，方法上的不同不应当、而且也不可能阻碍各个建设社会主义的国家实行紧密的合作。
    铁托强调说，我们应苏联的领导人的邀请前来访问，不是一次礼节上的访问，而是苏南两国一年来做了许多很有成效的工作之后所作的一次访问，这些工作使得有可能加强苏南两国互相之间的友好关系和全面合作。
    我们同你们的领导者就许许多多问题交换了意见，我可以说，我们在这些交谈中很容易地就发现了共同点，并且取得了相互谅解。我们在这些交谈中深深感到，你们的领导者正如我们一样，所关怀的首先是有关维护和平的事业，他们坚定地希望通过和平途径解决各种国际问题。
    铁托然后用很多的时间谈到了德国问题，欧洲安全问题和其他一些国际问题。在谈到联合国时，他说，联合国虽然一直在对一些国际问题起着巨大的作用，然而这个组织还不具有无所不包的性质。他认为，像中华人民共和国这样一个大国还没有能进入联合国，并且还有其他许多国家也没有加入联合国，这是一个不正常的事实。他说，我相信，接纳中国和其他国家进入联合国的问题很快就会得到解决。
    铁托还谈到了关于不同社会制度的国家和人民之间的和平共处的问题。铁托着重说，目前世界上存在着两个主要的体系——社会主义体系和资本主义体系。但是，这绝不意味着，这两个体系之间不可能就各个国家人民所关心的一切问题展开建设性的合作。
    铁托讲话结束时，全场再次欢呼苏南两国人民的友谊，发出暴风雨般的“乌拉”声。
    接着，贵宾们观看了场上举行的赛跑和精彩的足球赛。
