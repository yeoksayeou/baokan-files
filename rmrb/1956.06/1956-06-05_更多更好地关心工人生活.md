    Recently, the leading Party organs and enterprise leading cadres in some areas have personally gone deep into workers' families and dormitories to investigate and understand the workers' living conditions. They have provided subsidies and relief to workers who are truly experiencing difficulties, and at the same time, they have paid attention to improving collective welfare undertakings for employees, and strengthened the management of employee canteens, dormitories, and nurseries. These practices have been warmly welcomed by the workers and have further stimulated their political enthusiasm and production initiative.

    However, to date, many local Party leadership organs and enterprise leading cadres have not paid enough attention to the welfare issues of workers. Workers' housing has not been adjusted as needed; workers with many children and difficult living conditions have not received the assistance and relief they deserve; a small number of sick workers have not received timely treatment; there are also many problems in canteens and nurseries, and so on. For example, the living conditions of workers in the Fourth Engineering Department of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction are very poor: the workers live in crowded conditions, the air in the sheds is not circulating, and when it rains, the sheds leak everywhere. The workers said with dissatisfaction: "We are doing assembly line work during the day, and we are sitting up all night in the leaking sheds." Obviously, this serious disregard for the suffering of workers' lives and disregard for the health of workers cannot be allowed to continue.

    The main reason why these unreasonable and intolerable phenomena occur in these socialist enterprises is that quite a few enterprise leaders lack a correct understanding of the purpose of socialist production and the relationship between production and life under the socialist system. Among these enterprise leading cadres, there are some erroneous statements: "Completing the state plan is our responsibility, and caring for the lives of workers is the responsibility of the trade union." "We are too busy with production, we don't have time to take care of the workers' trivial life matters." They completely oppose production and life. Under the domination of this harmful ideology, some enterprise leading cadres only pay attention to the workers completing the production plan on time and exceeding the quota, while adopting an attitude of indifference to the problems in the lives of the workers. They have forgotten that the purpose of socialist production is to meet the needs of society. The law of socialist economic development is to gradually meet the material and cultural needs of the people on the basis of developing production. Attempting to oppose production and life, attempting to only manage production and not care about the lives of workers, is not the management method of socialist enterprises but the management method of capitalist enterprises. This approach will only disconnect production and consumption and affect the development of production. This approach will only hurt the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the workers, and make the production plan often in a state of difficult to complete. In many factories, there are a small number of workers who cannot concentrate on production due to long-term unresolved difficulties in their lives, which affects the completion of the production plan; when the leaders of the enterprise help them solve the difficulties in their lives, many of them quickly become advanced producers. Zheng Jinmei, an old worker at the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, used to be unable to concentrate on production and always failed to complete the plan because her husband was sick at home and had a lot of debt. Last winter, the trade union helped her overcome the difficulties in her life, and recently helped her send her sick child to the hospital for treatment. Her production enthusiasm has gradually increased, and she has increased from tending one roving frame to two. Does this stark contrast not illustrate the importance of caring for workers' lives to improve production?

    Some people say: To improve the lives of workers, we have to take out more money, but we don't have enough funds. It is true that improving the lives of workers requires money in many ways; as long as it is something that must be done and requires money, we must actively find ways to solve the source of funds, and it is wrong to put it aside without solving it. The problem is that many enterprise leading cadres, under the domination of the one-sided view of frugality, also hoard the money in the enterprise reward fund that can be used to improve the welfare of workers. This is most evident in the relief of workers with difficult lives. Many enterprises set the conditions for workers to receive subsidies and relief too high, and the approval procedures are too cumbersome; to receive a subsidy relief fund, some even need to go through eight approval procedures. Therefore, in these enterprises, the phenomenon of subsidy relief funds being hoarded and workers with difficult lives not being able to get subsidies and relief has been created. Moreover, in improving the welfare of workers, there are many things that do not require spending money or only require spending very little money. For example, running the existing employee canteen well does not require spending a lot of money, or even does not require spending any money at all. Recently, some factories and mines have only strengthened the political and ideological education of the canteen staff, overcome the one-sided enterprise-oriented view, reduced the price of meals, improved the quality of meals, increased the variety of meals, and reduced the time for employees to queue for meals, thus making most of the employees satisfied. These facts show that whether the welfare work of employees is done well or not, the main problem is not whether there is money, but whether the cadres have sufficient sympathy and responsibility for the workers, and whether they seriously do what should be done well.

    The fact that enterprise cadres, especially leading cadres, do not understand the actual living conditions of workers is also an important reason why many urgent and serious problems in the lives of workers have not been resolved for a long time. Many enterprise cadres are accustomed to the working style and methods of office work and rarely go deep into the homes and dormitories of employees to understand the situation and help workers solve ideological and life problems. Some enterprise leading cadres are willing to care about the lives of workers, but because their subjective efforts are not enough, they have not gone deep into the workers to conduct investigations and research. In this way, over time, the mass viewpoint of these enterprise leaders has gradually weakened, they are satisfied with the status quo, and they no longer think that they should go to the workers to understand the living conditions of the workers and help the workers solve problems in their lives; sometimes even if they understand some, they do not feel deeply because they have not seen it with their own eyes, and they do not feel the seriousness of the problem. Therefore, in order to truly care for the lives of workers in the future, not just in words, and to help employees solve problems that need to be solved and can be solved in a timely manner, it is necessary to change the working style and methods of office work, especially to enable enterprise leading cadres to get rid of the situation of bureaucratism and being busy and passive, to have time to consider the welfare issues of employees, and to be able to frequently or regularly go deep into the homes and dormitories of employees to conduct investigations and visits. To do this, enterprise leaders need to make up their minds, and their superior leading organs also need to hold fewer meetings and give them more time. Recently, when some organs and enterprise leading cadres visited the homes and dormitories of workers, saw many difficult problems in the lives of workers with their own eyes, and listened to the criticisms and opinions of the workers, they felt the serious harm of the past "squatting in offices and meeting rooms" and the work style not being in-depth. Therefore, many cadres began to change their work style and effectively take responsibility for solving the difficult problems in the lives of workers. This change is necessary. Those who have not done so must do so; those who have already started to do so should continue to maintain and carry forward this style of going deep into reality and connecting with the masses in the future.

### 更多更好地关心工人生活

    更多更好地关心工人生活
    最近一个时期，有些地方的党的领导机关和企业的领导干部，亲自深入到职工家庭和宿舍中去，调查了解了工人的生活情况，对于生活确实困难的工人进行了补助和救济，同时注意改善了职工的集体福利事业，加强了对职工食堂、宿舍和托儿所等的管理。这些做法，受到了职工的热烈欢迎，并且进一步激发了职工的政治热情和生产积极性。
    但是，直到目前为止，仍然有不少地方的党的领导机关和企业的领导干部，对职工的生活福利问题没有予以足够的注意。工人的住房还没有进行必要的调整；子女多而生活困难的职工，还没有得到应有的补助和救济；少数有病的工人，还没有得到及时的治疗；食堂和托儿所中的问题也很多，等等。例如：建筑工程部华北太原工程局第四工程处工人的住宿条件就很差：工人们住得很拥挤，工棚里的空气不流通，一遇下雨天，工棚里就到处漏水。工人不满意地说：“我们白天施工是流水作业，晚上睡觉是流水坐夜。”很显然，这种严重地漠视工人生活中的疾苦，不顾及工人身体健康的做法是不能容许它继续存在下去的。
    在这些社会主义企业里，所以发生这些不合理的和令人不能容忍的现象，主要是有相当多的企业领导者，对于社会主义生产的目的，社会主义制度下生产和生活的关系缺乏正确的认识。在这些企业领导干部中有着这样一些错误的说法：“完成国家计划是我们的责任，关心职工生活是工会的事情。”“生产都忙不过来，哪有时间管工人的生活琐事。”他们完全把生产和生活对立起来。在这种有害的思想支配之下，有些企业的领导干部所注意的，只是职工按时地和超额地完成生产计划，而对职工生活中的问题，采取不闻不问的态度。他们忘记了，社会主义生产的目的，就是为了满足社会的需要。社会主义经济发展规律，就是在发展生产的基础上，逐步地满足人民的物质和文化的需要。企图把生产和生活对立起来，企图只管生产、不管工人生活，这不是社会主义企业的经营方法而是资本主义企业的经营方法。这种作法，只会使生产和消费之间脱节，而影响生产的发展。这种作法，只会伤害职工群众的政治热情和生产积极性，而使生产计划经常处于难以完成的状态中。许多工厂都有少数工人由于生活上的困难问题长期得不到解决，不能集中精力进行生产，影响了生产计划的完成；当企业的领导者帮助他们解决了生活上的困难，他们中间的许多人很快就成了先进生产者。国营上海第一棉纺织厂的老工人郑金妹，以往因为丈夫生病在家，负债很多，生产时经常不安心，总是完不成计划。去年冬天，工会帮助她克服了生活上的困难，最近又帮助她把有病的孩子送医院治疗，她的生产积极性便逐渐地提高，已由挡一台粗纱机提高到两台。这一鲜明的对比，难道不是说明了关心工人生活对于搞好生产的重要性吗？
    有人说：改善职工生活，就得拿出更多的钱来，而我们却没有足够的经费。诚然，改善职工生活在许多方面是要用钱的；只要是必须作的而又必须用钱的事情，也就必须积极设法解决费用的来源问题，摆着不解决是不对的。问题是不少企业领导干部在片面节约观点支配之下，把企业奖励基金中可以用于改善职工生活福利的钱也积压起来。这在救济生活困难的职工方面表现得最明显。许多企业把职工受补助救济的条件规定得过高，批准的手续过于繁琐；领取一次补助救济金，有的竟至需要经过八道批准手续。因此，在这些企业里，就造成了补助救济金积压，而生活困难的职工却得不到补助救济的现象。而且，在改善职工的生活福利方面，也有许多事并不需要花钱或者只需要花很少的钱就可以办到。例如办好现有的职工食堂，就不需要花很多钱，甚至根本就不需要花钱。最近有些厂矿企业只是加强了对食堂工作人员的政治思想教育，克服了片面的企业化观点，就降低了饭菜的价格，提高了饭菜的质量，增多了饭菜的花样，减少了职工购饭排队的时间，从而作到了使大多数的职工满意。这些事实说明：职工的生活福利工作办得好不好，主要的问题并不是有没有钱，而是在于干部对工人是否具有充分的同情心和责任感，是否认真把应该办好的事办好。
    企业的干部，特别是领导干部，不了解工人生活的实际情况，也是工人生活中的许多迫切和严重问题长期得不到解决的一个重要原因。许多企业的干部习惯于机关化的工作作风和工作方法，很少深入到职工家庭和宿舍中去了解情况，帮助工人解决思想上和生活上的问题。有些企业的领导干部虽然也愿意关心工人的生活，但是由于他们主观努力不够，因而还是没有深入到工人中去作调查研究。这样，久而久之，这些企业领导人的群众观点也就逐渐淡薄起来，安于现状，不再想到应该到工人中去了解工人生活的状况，帮助工人解决生活方面的问题；有时即使了解了一些，也因为没有亲眼看见，体会不深，感觉不到问题的严重。因此，要在今后不是口头上而是实际地关心工人的生活，及时帮助职工解决需要而又可能解决的问题，就必须改变机关化的工作作风和工作方法，特别是要使企业领导干部摆脱事务主义和忙乱被动的状况，能够有时间考虑职工的生活福利问题，能够经常地或定期地深入到职工家庭和宿舍中去作调查访问。要做到这一点，需要企业领导者下决心，也需要他们的上级领导机关少开一些会议，多给他们一些时间。最近一个时期，当一些机关和企业的领导干部到工人的家庭和宿舍进行访问，亲眼看见工人生活中的许多困难问题，听取了工人的批评和意见以后，他们就感到了过去“光蹲办公室和会议室”，工作作风不深入的严重危害性。因而许多干部开始转变了自己的工作作风，切实地负起责任来为工人解决生活中的困难问题。这种转变是必要的。凡是没有这样作的，一定要这样作；已经开始这样作了的，应该在今后继续保持和发扬这种深入实际、联系群众的作风。
