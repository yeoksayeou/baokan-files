Xinhua News Agency: The Semiconductor Laboratory of the Physics Department of Northeast People's University has successfully trial-produced point-contact crystal transistors using the semiconductor "germanium," following the development of "germanium" power rectifiers.

This crystal transistor is the same standard as the Soviet point-contact crystal transistor CIA type, with a voltage amplification factor of 30 to 40 times.

In the laboratory, Associate Professor Gao Dingsan, lecturer Chen Jingming, and lab technician Wang Guoxing of the Physics Department conducted experiments for reporters. When current passed through the transistor, the "buzzing" sound from the loudspeaker was much louder than when it did not pass through the transistor. This transistor is very small, only about one three-hundredth the size of a typical radio vacuum tube, and it is also very light. It has no filament, so it consumes very little power, and it is simple in construction, sturdy, and durable. If such semiconductor transistors are used to manufacture radios powered by dry cell batteries, the radio will only be the size of a cigarette case, making it very convenient to carry.

Semiconductor transistors can replace most vacuum tubes. In addition to radios, they can also be used in electronic calculators, wired and wireless telephones, other electronic instruments, and automatic control systems.

After gradually accumulating experience in manufacturing transistors, researchers at the Semiconductor Laboratory of the Physics Department of Northeast People's University are now preparing to trial-produce more advanced semiconductor transistors: P-N-P junction semiconductor transistors.

    用半导体“锗”试制三极管成功
    新华社讯　东北人民大学物理学系半导体实验室继“锗”功率整流器之后，利用半导体“锗”试制点接触型的晶体三极管成功。
    这种晶体三极管和苏联的点接触型晶体三极管CIA型的标准一样，它的电压放大倍数达三十到四十倍。
    在实验室中，物理学系副教授高鼎三、讲师陈景明和实验员汪国兴等为记者进行了试验。当电流通过这个三极管时，扩音器发出的“翁”声比没有通过三极管时大许多。这个三极管很小，只相当于一般收音机真空管的三百分之一，重量也很轻。它没有灯丝，所以消耗电量极小，并且构造简单，坚固耐用。如果用这种半导体三极管制造以干电池作电源的收音机，收音机就只有烟盒大小，携带很方便。
    半导体三极管可以代替大部分的真空管。除了收音机外，它还可以用在电子计算器、有线及无线电话和其他电子仪器，以及自动控制系统等方面。
    东北人民大学物理学系半导体实验室研究人员逐渐积累制造三极管的经验以后，现在准备试制更高级的半导体三极管P—N—P结型半导体三极管。
