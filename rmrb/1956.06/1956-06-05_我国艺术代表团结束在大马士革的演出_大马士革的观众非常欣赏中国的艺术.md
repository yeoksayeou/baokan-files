Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 2nd: The China Cultural and Art Delegation's performances for the public in Damascus concluded on June 1st. A total of 14,000 people in the city saw Chinese song and dance and drama.

During the seven performances, every show was not only sold out, but even after adding seats, many people had to stand to watch. Some even climbed onto high places behind the walls to see the performance.

The audience greatly enjoyed Chinese art. The theater was often filled with laughter and applause. Highly symbolic performances, such as the scene of the boat swaying on the water in "Autumn River," particularly aroused the audience's interest. When the audience suddenly understood what was being performed on stage, the atmosphere in the hall was very lively.

The Arabic songs and dances performed by the Chinese artists won the audience's appreciation and praise. Many people sang along, and many others clapped in time with the beat.

Many celebrities also went backstage during intermission to praise Chinese art to the delegation.

Newspaper opinion expressed a warm welcome to Chinese art.

The "Al-Fajr" ("Dawn") newspaper published a commentary on May 26th titled "Damascus Intoxicated in the Moonlight of Dreams - Treasures of Chinese Art." It said that the performance of the Chinese artists was very beautiful. Everyone was satisfied with this wonderful evening. The first song, "Song of Chinese-Syrian Friendship," was very popular. People couldn't help but forget themselves.

The "Alef Baa" newspaper wrote on May 27th that the performance of the Chinese delegation was one of the most beautiful arts that Syrians had ever seen.

The "Al-Nour" ("Torch") newspaper's commentary wrote that this kind of art is by no means inferior to any international standard. The national form of Chinese art and its mass character, especially the Arabic songs and dances they performed, aroused the general attention of the Syrian public and opinion. In addition, it also promoted the Syrian people's demand for the development of national art.

    我国艺术代表团结束在大马士革的演出
    大马士革的观众非常欣赏中国的艺术
    据新华社大马士革2日讯　中国文化艺术代表团为大马士革公众举行的演出已经在六月一日结束了。这个城市一共有一万四千人看到了中国的歌舞和戏剧。
    在总共七场的演出中，不仅场场客满，而且往往在加了座位以后还是有许多人不得不站着来观看。有些人甚至爬上围墙后面的高处看表演。
    观众很欢喜中国的艺术。剧场里常常充满笑声和掌声。高度象征性的表演，例如在“秋江”中的船只在水面上摇荡的场面，特别引起观众的兴趣。当观众突然领会到台上在表演什么的时候，场内的气氛十分活跃。
    中国艺术家表演的阿拉伯歌舞博得了观众的欣赏和赞扬。许多人跟着唱，还有许多人按着拍子鼓掌。
    不少社会名流还在休息时间到后台去，向代表团赞扬中国的艺术。
    报纸舆论对中国艺术表示热烈的欢迎。
      “先锋报”五月二十六日刊载了一篇评论，题目是“大马士革沉醉在梦境的月光中——中国艺术的珍宝”。其中说，中国艺术家的演出是非常美丽的。每一个人都对这个奇妙的晚上感到满意。第一支歌曲“中叙友谊歌”深受欢迎。人们都不禁忘掉了他们自己。
    五月二十七日的“艾列弗巴报”写道，中国代表团的表演是叙利亚人所曾经见过的最优美的艺术之一。
      “火炬报”的评论写道，这种艺术绝不低于任何国际水平。中国艺术的民族形式和它的群众性，特别是他们所表演的阿拉伯歌舞，引起了叙利亚一般公众和舆论的普遍注意，此外，它还促进了叙利亚人对发展民族艺术的要求。
