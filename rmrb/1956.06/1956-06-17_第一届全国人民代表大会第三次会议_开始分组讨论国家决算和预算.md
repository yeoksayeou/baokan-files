Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Third Session of the First National People's Congress began group discussions today on the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget.

Beginning this morning, each delegation group first reviewed the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget, and read and discussed the report made by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, on the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget.

In the group discussions, many delegation groups raised questions about the relevant items of income and expenditure in the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget, the investment ratio between heavy industry and light industry, investment in agricultural, forestry and water conservancy construction, expenditure in culture, education and science, and the division of responsibilities and powers between the central and local finances. Responsible staff members sent by the State Council to the meeting to provide consultation gave explanations to the questions raised by the delegates.

The Anhui delegation group believed in the discussion that the investment ratio for heavy industry and light industry, industry and agriculture in the 1956 budget was appropriate. Some delegates expressed their support for the state's appropriate expansion of local authority and flexibility in financial management, and they cited many specific facts to illustrate the necessity of this measure. Delegates from the Heilongjiang delegation group expressed satisfaction with the increase in the proportion of funds for culture, education and science. They believed that this was a huge support given by the state for the further development of our country's culture, education and science.

When discussing the 1955 state final accounts, some delegation groups also raised criticisms of certain work of government departments based on the situations and problems they saw during their recent inspection work. Some delegates from the Shanghai delegation group believed that the commercial revenue stipulated in the 1955 state final accounts had not fulfilled its task. In addition to some objective reasons, the commercial departments themselves also had many shortcomings in organizing the supply of materials and meeting the needs of the people. Some delegates from the Liaoning delegation group criticized the phenomenon of one-sided pursuit of production figures and neglect of safety in some industrial and mining enterprises. They hoped that the government would take effective measures in this regard.

Some delegation groups did not hold discussions today. The delegates of these groups are reading relevant documents and preparing opinions.

According to the agenda of the meeting, the meeting will be adjourned for one day on the 17th. On the 18th, the meeting will continue with group discussions and begin the plenary discussion.

    第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议  
    开始分组讨论国家决算和预算
    新华社16日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议今天分组讨论1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算。
    今天上午开始，各代表小组首先对1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算进行审查，并且阅读和讨论了国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念所作的关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告。
    在分组讨论中，许多代表小组对1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算中，有关收入和支出的项目、重工业和轻工业的投资比重、农林水利建设的投资、文化教育和科学等方面的支出、中央财政和地方财政的职责范围和权限的划分等方面的有关问题，提出了询问。国务院派到会场备咨询的负责工作人员，对代表们提出的这些问题作了解释。
    安徽代表小组在讨论中认为1956年预算中对于重工业和轻工业、工业和农业的投资比例是恰当的。有些代表对于国家将适当地扩大地方在财政管理方面的权限和机动性表示拥护，他们引用许多具体事实说明这一措施的必要性。黑龙江代表小组代表对于文化教育和科学的经费比例的增长表示满意。他们认为这是国家对于进一步发展我国文化教育和科学事业所给予的巨大支持。
    有些代表小组在讨论1955年国家决算的时候，代表们还根据他们不久以前在视察工作中看到的情况和问题，对政府部门的某些工作提出了批评。上海代表小组有的代表认为1955年国家决算中规定的商业收入没有完成任务，除了一些客观原因外，商业部门本身在组织物资供应、满足人民需要方面也存在着许多缺点。辽宁代表小组有些代表对某些工矿企业里面发生的片面追求产量数字、忽视安全的现象提出了批评。他们希望政府在这方面采取有效措施。
    一部分代表小组今天没有进行讨论。这些小组的代表正在阅读有关文件，准备意见。
    按照会议议程，十七日会议休会一天。十八日，会议将继续分组讨论和开始大会讨论。
