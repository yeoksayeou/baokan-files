    After listening to the reports of Vice Premier Li, Vice Chairman Peng, and Minister Liao, I am very excited. In the short span of over six years since the founding of the country, our country has firmly laid the socialist economic foundation and has basically completed the great socialist transformation of agriculture. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of the people and our peaceful diplomatic policy, we have also achieved great victories. All of this is encouraging the people to forge ahead courageously.
    Premier Zhou once said to scientists: Our work is to take action first, and learn and improve in action. He cited the work of oil exploration as an example: sending out a large number of drilling teams to drill extensively in places where oil might be found. Oil fields were discovered in large quantities through this method of work, and some oil has already been brought to the surface. If we waited until all the geological data was ready, we would have nothing now.
    The same is true of agricultural cooperatives. The land of state-owned farms and advanced cooperatives has reached tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of mu, but our land planning work is still lacking in research and educational departments. State-owned farms and cooperatives did not wait for this science to be established before developing, but instead gained experience in the process of development.
    However, scientific work is absolutely indispensable. Today, when scientific work in our country is far behind life, we must find ways in all aspects to ensure that production is not damaged and to ensure increased production.
    First, land planning work must be done cautiously. The Party committees and people's governments of provinces and counties should focus on summarizing experience and preferably organize experienced cooperative cadres, model workers, and scientists to jointly discuss and study, and propose a land planning model for a region. For example, the rotation area in the Soviet Union is generally 1,500 mu, while the Qiyi Farm in Cheng'an, Hebei, only plans 500 to 600 mu, which is too small.
    As long as a scientific discussion is conducted and preliminary scientific bases are found, major errors will not occur.
    Second, "watching wells" and "hanging plows" are already lessons from a few years ago. Because we did not accept the lesson of "hanging plows" with the seven-inch plow, the double-wheel double-furrow plow still experienced "hanging plows." Its losses are many times greater than those of the seven-inch plow. The losses from "watching wells" for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wells are unknown compared to "watching wells" for hundreds of wells. If we still do not accept the lessons, the losses from future mechanization and electrification will be even greater.
    Lenin often warned us to pay attention to small things, and we often neglect the big things in which millions of people are involved.
    If we had first held training classes (with promoters as the backbone) and focused on demonstrations to gain experience before promoting the seven-inch plow, although it would have seemed slow for a year or two, the actual implementation would have been on a solid foundation.
    Agricultural production has strict regional characteristics. This is true for agricultural tools, seeds, diseases, insects, and cultivation techniques. The technical foundation of the masses is also very important. It is a mistake to not consult with the masses or gain experience in key areas. The Soviet Union is still vigorously opposing subjectivism and bureaucracy today, which shows that this point is very important.
    Third, it is recommended that provinces, special districts, counties, and cooperatives establish scientific and technological committees, and absorb production experts and scientists to participate. Hebei Province will soon establish a scientific and technological committee and invite scientists from educational departments and research institutions to participate. Special meetings will be held to discuss matters and propose solutions for the government's reference. This is also beneficial to the work of educators and scientists themselves. The scientific and technological conferences in Shijiazhuang and Handan Special Districts in recent years have played a very good role and can be used as a reference for everyone.
    Party committees and people's governments at all levels should grasp key cooperatives of different production types in different regions when leading agricultural production, and conduct in-depth research and summarize experience, so that they can continuously improve. With typical demonstrations, it will be easier to promote.
    In short, the production and production planning of large-scale mechanized state-owned farms and advanced cooperatives must rely on as much scientific basis as possible and closely combine with the local masses' experience to ensure fewer losses.

    制定农业生产规划必须多找科学根据
    ——陈凤桐代表的发言
    我听到李副总理、彭副委员长、廖部长报告之后，我非常兴奋。在短短的建国六年多时间内，我国已稳固的奠定下社会主义经济基础，已基本上完成伟大的农业社会主义改造工作，由于全国人民热烈的拥护和支持我们的和平外交政策，亦取得巨大的胜利，这一切都在鼓舞着全国人民奋勇前进。
    周总理曾对科学家谈到：我们的工作是先行动起来，在行动中学习、提高。他举出探油矿工作为例，就是派出大批的钻探队在可能出油的地方，广泛的钻探，油田就从这样的工作方法中大量的被发现了，有的油已经引到地面上来了，如果等到地质资料备齐，那现在什么也不会有。
    农业合作社也是如此。国营农场、高级合作社的土地已经达到几万亩几十万亩几百万亩，但我们的土地规划工作，在研究部门和教育部门，都还是缺门，国营农场、合作社并没有等待这门科学建立之后，才去发展，而是在发展中摸经验。
    但科学工作是万万不能忽视的，在我国科学工作远远落后于生活的今天，我们必须从各方面想办法，保证生产不受损失，保证增产。
    第一、土地规划工作必须慎重。各省、县的党和人民政府，应重点总结经验，最好组织有经验的社干部、劳模和科学家，参照苏联先进经验共同讨论研究，提出一个地区的土地规划范例，例如苏联轮作区一般是1，500亩，河北成安七一农庄只规划500到600亩，就太小了。
    只要经过一番科学讨论，初步找出科学根据，就不会发生太大的错误。
    第二、看井、挂犁，已经是几年前的教训，因为我们没有接受七寸步犁的挂犁教训，所以双轮双铧犁仍然出现了挂犁，它的损失，已比七寸步犁大好多倍。几万眼几十万眼井的看井，要比几百眼井的看井损失不知大多少倍。如果仍不接受教训，将来机械化电气化的损失，就会更大。
    列宁常常警告我们要注意小的事情，我们常常疏忽千百万人在活动的大事情。
    假如我们在推广七寸步犁以先，开训练班（以推广员为骨干），重点示范，摸出经验，虽然看着是慢一年两年，实际推行起来是在稳固的基础之上的。
    农业生产有严格的区域性，不论农具、种子、病、虫、耕作栽培都是如此，群众的技术基础也是很重要的，不和群众商议，不在重点上摸出经验是会犯错误的，苏联今天还在大力反对主观主义和官僚主义，就说明这一点是很重要的。
    第三、建议省、专、县、社，成立科学技术委员会，吸收生产能手、科学家参加。河北省最近将成立科学技术委员会，聘请教育部门、研究机关科学家参加，遇事举行专门会议讨论，提出方案，作政府参考。这对教育家科学家的本身工作，也有好处。石家庄、邯郸专区几年来的科学技术会议，都起到很好的作用，可作大家参考。
    各级党和人民政府，在领导农业生产上，都应在不同地区掌握不同生产类型的重点社，深入的研究和总结经验，就可以不断提高。有了典型示范，也就容易推广。
    总之大规模的机耕国营农场和高级合作社的生产和生产规划，必须尽可能的多找科学根据，密切的结合当地群众经验，保证少受损失。
