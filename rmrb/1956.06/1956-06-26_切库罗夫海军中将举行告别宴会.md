Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 25th: At 8 PM, Vice Admiral Chukulov held a farewell banquet for representatives from all circles of Shanghai on the afterdeck of his flagship, the cruiser "Pozharsky."

　　Chukulov used Chinese to invite the guests to "Cheers!" Sitting beside him were Xiao Jingguang, Deputy Minister of National Defense and Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, Grand Admiral; Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee's Shanghai Bureau and First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee; and Xu Jianguo, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, among others. Around several rows of long tables opposite this row sat Vice Admiral Luo Shunchu, Deputy Commander of the Navy; Vice Admiral Tao Yong, Commander of the East Sea Fleet, as well as generals and colonels from the East Sea Fleet and the Shanghai Garrison, heads of various departments of the Shanghai Party and government, renowned Shanghai scientists, educators, actors, painters, representatives from the press, and representatives from democratic parties and people's organizations.

　　Chukulov said to his guests: Tomorrow, the Soviet friendly visit fleet will conclude its friendly visit and will leave Shanghai Port to return home. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Soviet friendly visit fleet, I would like to express my warm gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the leaders of the Shanghai Party and government, the citizens of Shanghai, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the glorious soldiers of the Navy, and the great Chinese people for the warm and sincere hospitality and care they have given us. We will never forget these wonderful days we spent with you. During our visit to your magnificent country, we have personally witnessed the outstanding achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in socialist construction, and we sincerely wish you new achievements in all aspects of socialist construction. Every achievement you make makes all Soviet people - your sincere friends and brothers - feel happy and inspired. When we return to Vladivostok, we will definitely convey the sincere and friendly care of the people of Shanghai, especially the youth of Shanghai, to the working people and Communist Youth League members of Vladivostok.

　　Grand Admiral Xiao Jingguang and Secretary Ke Qingshi expressed their reluctance to part with Chukulov and all the officers and soldiers of the visiting fleet on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy and the people of Shanghai. Xiao Jingguang said: This friendly visit of yours has left an extremely good impression among our people and army, and has enabled our naval forces to learn many valuable things, which will have a profound impact on the construction of our navy. Xiao Jingguang said: We are about to part, but our friendship will last forever. Then he raised his glass and proposed a toast to the health of Vice Admiral Chukulov and all the officers and soldiers of the visiting fleet, to the health of all comrades in the Soviet Navy, and to the eternal friendship between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union, and wished the visiting fleet a smooth journey home.

　　After the banquet, colorful fireworks burst into the sky over the Bund of Nanjing Road, and many blue and white searchlights were erected on both sides of the Huangpu River. The people of Shanghai held the last grand joint celebration for the Soviet fleet's visit to Shanghai. All the roads leading to the Bund and the Bund Avenue were blocked by joyful crowds. Loud singing filled the ground, colorful fireworks flew in the sky, and a long string of colorful lights on more than 20 high-rise buildings on the shore and on the Soviet warships in the heart of the river reflected in the light, illuminating the Huangpu River in this area. Soviet sailors and Shanghai citizens, as well as officers and soldiers of our army, navy and air force, sang and danced beside the beautiful green belt on the riverbank. Many amateur worker and student performance teams once again performed dragon lantern and lion dances for the departing guests. Until midnight, Soviet sailors and Shanghai citizens were still exchanging mailing addresses, reluctant to part.

    切库罗夫海军中将举行告别宴会
    据新华社上海25日电　晚上八点钟，海军中将切库罗夫在他的旗舰“波日阿尔斯基”号巡洋舰的后甲板上，举行向上海市各界代表的告别宴会。
    切库罗夫用中国话请客人们“干杯”。他的身边坐着国防部副部长兼中国人民解放军海军司令员萧劲光大将、中共中央上海局书记兼中共上海市委员会第一书记柯庆施、上海市副市长许建国等人。在这排桌子对面的几排长桌周围，坐着海军副司令员罗舜初海军中将、东海舰队司令陶勇海军中将以及东海舰队和上海警备部队的将军们、校官们，上海市党和政府各部门的负责人，上海市著名的科学家、教育家、演员、画家、新闻界代表和民主党派、人民团体的代表们。
    切库罗夫向他的客人们说：明天，苏联友好访华舰队将结束友好访问，就要离开上海港返航回国了。我代表苏联友好访华舰队的全体官兵，向中国共产党、向上海市党和政府的领导人、向上海市民、向中国人民解放军以及海军的光荣的军人们、向伟大的中国人民致以热烈的谢意，感谢他们所给予我们的热烈而真挚的款待和关怀。我们永远不会忘记和你们在一起所欢度过的这些美好的日子。在访问你们壮丽的国家的时候，我们亲眼看到了中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设中获得的优异的成就，衷心预祝你们在社会主义建设的各方面获得新的成就。你们的每一个成就都使全体苏联人民——你们真挚的朋友和兄弟感到欢欣鼓舞。当我们回到海参崴市的时候，我们定将上海市人民，特别是上海的青年们的真挚的和友谊的关怀，转达给海参崴市的劳动人民和共青团员们。
    萧劲光海军大将和柯庆施书记分别代表中国人民解放军海军和上海市人民，向切库罗夫和访华舰队的全体官兵表示惜别之意。萧劲光说：你们这一次的友好访问，在我们人民和军队中间，留下了极其良好的印象，使我们的海军部队学习到很多宝贵的东西，这对我国海军的建设将会起到深远的影响。萧劲光说：我们就要离别，但我们的友谊常在。接着他举起酒杯，提议为切库罗夫海军中将及访华舰队全体官兵的健康，为苏联海军全体同志们的健康，为中苏两国人民及其军队间的永恒的友谊，干杯，并祝即将返国的访华舰队一帆风顺。
    宴会之后，南京路外滩上空迸发出采色的烟火，黄浦江两岸竖起许多青白色的探照灯灯光。上海市人民举行苏联舰队访问上海的最后一次盛大联欢晚会。所有通向外滩的大小马路和外滩大道都被欢乐的人群堵塞着，地面上歌声响亮，上空飞舞着采色烟火，岸上二十多座高楼大厦和江心中苏联军舰上的一长串一长串的五光十色的采灯交映在光辉照亮了这一带的黄浦江面。苏联水兵和上海市民及我国的海陆空军官兵，在江边优美的绿化地带旁载歌载舞，许多业余的工人、学生演出队为即将离别的客人再一次表演了龙灯和狮子舞。直到深夜十二点苏联水兵和上海市民还在交换通信地址，依依惜别。
