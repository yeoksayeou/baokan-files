Xinhua News Agency, 9th. This week, the temperature in Beijing at noon often exceeded thirty degrees Celsius. Many workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant now have fans to cool them down while they work.

Medical personnel from the workshop health station constantly go to the hottest areas of the workshops to measure temperatures and check the physical condition of workers engaged in heavy manual labor. Some workers suffering from heart disease, high blood pressure, and other conditions that are unsuitable for working in high temperatures have been reassigned to other jobs. In each worker's rest area, there is not only herbal tea, but also newly added salted mung bean soup and salted soda. For workers engaged in loading and unloading ore in the open air, large canvas awnings are erected wherever they move to work, providing them with a place to rest. Some loaders can also rest in water curtain rest rooms where cold water constantly flows down the walls. The temperature in this water curtain rest room is more than ten degrees lower than in the open sunlight, and it also allows workers to take half-body showers.

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has a lot of handling work that used to be done manually; especially workers engaged in loading and unloading work near coke ovens and sintering pots, who were exposed to the sun and surrounded by the red-hot sintering ore and coke. To improve the workers' working conditions in the summer, the state allocated more than 200,000 yuan in the first quarter of this year for the plant to purchase lifting and transporting machinery. These newly purchased machines are now being installed. By the end of June, 200 to 300 workers throughout the plant who were originally engaged in loading and unloading work in high temperatures will be reassigned to lighter jobs. At the same time, steel windows that facilitate air circulation will be installed in the casting workshop buildings that originally lacked ventilation equipment.

### 石景山钢铁厂改善工人夏天劳动条件

    石景山钢铁厂改善工人夏天劳动条件
    新华社9日讯　这一周，北京中午的气温经常超过了三十度。在石景山钢铁厂工作的许多工人，生产的时候已经有扇风机在旁边为他们降温。
    车间保健站的医务人员，不断地到车间最热的地方测量温度，检查重体力劳动的工人们的身体情况。有些患有心脏病、高血压症等不适宜于在高温下工作的工人，已经分别调换了工作。在各个工人的休息室里，不仅有凉茶，还新增加了盐绿豆汤和盐汽水。在露天从事矿石装卸工作的工人们，无论流动到那里工作，供他们休息的大帆布篷就在那里架起来。有的装卸工人还可以到四壁不断淋着冷水的水幕休息室里休息。这个水幕休息室里的温度，比日光露天下低十多度，它还可以供工人们淋半身浴。
    石景山钢铁厂有许多搬运工作，原来都是用手工操作的；特别是在焦炉和烧结锅旁从事装卸工作的工人，头上太阳晒，四周通红的烧结矿和焦炭在烤。为了改善工人们在夏天的劳动条件，今年第一季度里，国家就已经拨款二十多万元，供这个厂购买起重和运输的机器。现在这些新买来的机器都正在安装。到六月底，全厂将有二、三百个原来在高温下从事装卸工作的工人，要调换较轻一些的工作。同时原来缺少通风设备的铸造车间的厂房，也将安上便于空气流通的钢窗。
