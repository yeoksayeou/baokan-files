Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 8th - Foreign Minister Naradhip urged the Thai press to refute the slander made by the American "New York Times," during his speech to the press on May 31st. He said that the reports in this American newspaper were particularly absurd.

The three articles by the "New York Times" insulting the Thai government have aroused public indignation in Thailand. Finance Minister Yuthakit also stated to the press on May 31st that, in reality, as stated by Deputy Interior Minister and Police Director-General Nai Phao Sriyanond, Americans are interfering too much in Thailand's politics. He expressed extreme indignation at the "New York Times" reports.

The "Honor Daily," in its June 1st editorial, pointed out, "We believe that Nai Phao Sriyanond's accusation of excessive American interference in Thai internal affairs is completely factual, and this has been the case for a long time." The editorial argued that the Thai government's excessive subservience to the United States and granting the United States too much freedom have enabled the United States to interfere in Thai internal affairs. The editorial advocated that the Thai authorities should find ways to resolve these issues quickly and thoroughly.

The "Free Communications Daily" also published an editorial on the same day, expressing support for Nai Phao and Director of the Public Relations Department, Khachon Sukkhakan, in their criticism of American interference in Thai internal affairs and their advocacy for revising the Thai-U.S. immigration agreement to abolish all privileges for Americans entering the country. The editorial stated that the Thai people are not cowardly people, and Thailand is not anyone's servant. "We will fight, not worship and beg anyone." "We will stand among all nations like a nation with honor."

Dozens of Thai-language newspapers in Thailand jointly wrote a letter to the "Thai Press Association" on May 31st, requesting a special meeting to be convened, and inviting people from all walks of life to attend, to discuss recommending to the Thai government the cancellation of the order prohibiting commentary on foreign politics, and to discuss whether the government should amend the Thai-U.S. immigration agreement in order to abolish all privileges for Americans entering the country.

    泰外长要泰国报界反击美报的诽谤
    “荣誉报”指出泰政府过份俯就美国招致了美国的干预
    新华社8日讯　曼谷消息：外交部长那拉底要求泰国报界反击美国“纽约时报”的诽谤，这是他在五月三十一日向报界发表谈话的时候说的。他说，美国这一家报纸的报道是特别荒谬的。
      “纽约时报”的三篇侮辱泰国政府的文章在泰国已经激起了公愤。财政部长裕他吉在五月三十一日也向报界发表谈话说，实际上正如内政部副部长兼警察总监乃炮·是耶暖所说的，美国人在政治上干预泰国太多了，他对“纽约时报”的报道表示极为愤慨。
    “荣誉报”在六月一日发表的社论中指出，我们认为乃炮·是耶暖对美国太多干预泰国内政的指责是完全合乎事实的，而且这种事实也是由来已久。社论认为，由于泰国政府过份俯就美国和给予美国太多自由，以致使得美国能够干预泰国内政。社论主张，泰国当局应当找寻办法迅速完善地解决这些问题。
      “自由通讯报”在同一天也发表社论表示支持乃炮和民众联络厅厅长甲军冲抨击美国干预泰国内政和主张修改有关泰美移民协定的言论。社论说，泰国人民不是怯弱的人民，泰国不是谁的奴仆。“我们将进行斗争，而不是向谁朝拜乞求”。“我们将像有荣誉的国家一样站在所有国家当中”。
    泰国的几十家泰文报纸在五月三十一日联名写信给“泰国报界公会”，要求召开特别大会，并邀请各界人士出席，来讨论向泰国政府建议取消禁止评论外国政治的命令，并且讨论政府是否应修改泰美移民协定，以便废除美国人入境的一切特权的问题。
