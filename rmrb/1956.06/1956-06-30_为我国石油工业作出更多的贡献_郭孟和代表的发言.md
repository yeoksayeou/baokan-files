I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, as well as the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives.

Over the past year, the production and capital construction of the Yumen Oilfield have developed rapidly. Especially after the struggle against right-leaning conservative ideology, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers have greatly increased, and a new atmosphere has emerged in all aspects. By April of this year, 70% of the workers in the entire mine had participated in socialist competitions. In the Drilling Construction Company, Machinery Plant, and Hydroelectric Power Plant alone, 7 units, 707 advanced producers and 44 advanced collectives emerged in the first quarter of this year. Many of those who were previously backward have now become advanced. There are currently 62 advanced experiences that have been promoted or are being promoted. The number of rationalization proposals has also increased significantly. From January to April of this year, the workers submitted 2,076 proposals, and 390 were implemented in the first quarter, saving the state more than 360,000 yuan. Many old quotas have been broken, and new records are constantly emerging. In the fourth quarter of last year, the average monthly drilling progress was 338.2 meters, which increased to 581.4 meters in the first quarter of this year, exceeding 71.9%. On May 30th this year, the 3206 drilling team drilled 601.2 meters, breaking their own national record of 462.3 meters per day set in January of this year. The machinery plant set 91 new records in four months; 44 drivers in the transportation department have driven safely for 100,000 kilometers. The young people in the entire mine are even more enthusiastic about increasing production and practicing economy, and the results in the first four months of this year can be converted into more than 14,800 taels of gold.

Since the news that the state had found two large oilfields in Karamay and Qaidam came, all the workers of the Yumen Oilfield felt unspeakably happy. In the past, imperialists said that our country was an "anemic" country in terms of oil. This statement has now gone bankrupt. Facts have proved that our country's oil reserves are abundant, and the development prospects of the oil industry are vast.

The current task of the Yumen Oilfield is to strive to produce more oil for the country, do a good job in expansion, and at the same time, support and cooperate with the construction of the Karamay and Qaidam oilfields in all aspects. At present, the entire mine has a certain foundation in terms of manpower, equipment, technology, and experience, and transportation conditions have also improved compared to the past, especially since the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been connected to the mine. Therefore, as long as we make full use of these good conditions, redouble our efforts, and oppose both right-leaning conservatism and prevent rash advances, we will definitely be able to make more contributions to China's petroleum industry.

At present, there are still two important problems in our mine. One is the supply of basic construction materials, mainly steel, cement, and some equipment, is insufficient. As a result, there have been phenomena of work stoppages and idle work. Although we have also tried to use substitute materials and find stagnant materials, they are limited after all and cannot fundamentally solve the difficulties. At this meeting, I listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report and learned that the shortage of materials is a national problem, and the country is trying to solve it step by step in various ways. However, I still hope that more can be supplied within the possible range this year. The other is the issue of worker welfare. Before liberation, the Yumen Oilfield was a mess, and welfare facilities were out of the question. There was no old foundation to utilize in this regard. Since liberation, worker welfare has been continuously improved. Taking the newly built residential area from 1950 to 1955 as an example, it has increased 4 times compared to before liberation. However, the number of workers has increased even faster during the same period, reaching more than 11 times. Under such circumstances, housing has become a big problem. Many workers cannot bring their families or cannot get married because they have no housing; even if they bring their families, they cannot live together; even the single dormitories, 16 square meters in size, have to accommodate seven or eight people. As for eating, haircuts, bathing, watching operas, and shopping, there are also many difficulties. Of course, it is impossible to solve these all at once, and they can only be solved gradually. Now the state has begun to improve worker welfare, which shows concern for workers, and we strongly support it. We hope that solutions can be found as soon as possible.

### 为我国石油工业作出更多的贡献——郭孟和代表的发言

    为我国石油工业作出更多的贡献
    ——郭孟和代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长、彭真副委员长的报告和高级农业生产合作社示范章程。
    一年来，玉门油矿的生产和基本建设发展很快。尤其是在进行了反对右倾保守思想的斗争以后，职工同志们的积极性和创造性大大提高，各方面都出现了新的气象。到今年4月，全矿有70％的职工已经参加了社会主义竞赛。单是在钻井建筑公司、机械厂、水电厂等7个单位，今年第一季度就出现了707个先进生产者和44个先进集体；不少过去是落后的，现在变成了先进。目前已经推广的和正在推广的先进经验有62种。合理化建议也是大量增加，今年1月到4月，职工同志就提出了2，076件，第一季度实现了390件，就给国家节约36万多元。许多旧的定额都被突破，新的纪录不断出现。在去年第四季度，钻机的平均月进度是338.2公尺，今年第一季度提高到581.4公尺，超过71.9％。3206钻井队在今年5月30日那一天钻进了601.2公尺，突破了他们自己在今年1月所创造的日进尺462.3公尺的全国纪录。机械厂四个月来出现了91项新纪录；运输处有44位司机安全行驶10万公里。全矿青年增产节约的劲头更大，今年头四个月的成绩，就可以折合14，800多两黄金。
    自从国家在克拉玛依和柴达木找到两个大油田的消息传来以后，玉门油矿的全体职工都感到说不出的高兴。过去帝国主义说我国在石油方面是个“贫血”国家，这种说法，现在已经破产了，事实证明，我国的石油蕴藏量是丰富的，石油工业的发展前途是远大的。
    玉门油矿当前的任务，是要努力给国家生产更多的石油，做好扩建工作，同时，要在各方面支持和配合克拉玛依和柴达木油田的建设。目前全矿的人力、设备、技术和经验，已经有了一定的基础，交通运输条件也比过去改善了，特别是兰新铁路已经通到矿上。所以只要我们充分利用这些好条件，加倍努力，既反对右倾保守主义，又防止急躁冒进情况，我们一定能够给我国的石油工业做出更多的贡献来。
    现在我们矿上还存在两个重要问题。一个是基本建设的材料，主要是钢材、水泥和一些设备，供应不上。因此已经发生了停工和窝工的现象。虽然，我们也想办法用代用料和找呆滞料，但是毕竟有限，不能从根本上解决困难。这次会上，我听了李先念副总理的报告，知道材料不足是个全国性的问题，国家正在从各方面想法逐步解决。不过，总还希望今年在可能范围以内能够多供应一些。另一个是职工福利的问题。解放前玉门油矿是一个烂摊子，福利设施根本谈不到，这方面没有什么旧的基础可以利用。解放以来，职工福利不断地得到改善。就拿从1950年到1955年新修的住宅面积来说，比解放前增加了4倍。可是，同一个时期职工人数增加得更快，达到11倍还多。在这样情况下，居住就成了很大问题。许多职工因为没有住宅不能带家或者不能结婚；有的即便带了家，也不能住在一起；就是单身宿舍，16平方公尺大的一间，也要住到七、八个人。至于吃饭、理发、洗澡、看戏、买东西也是困难很多。当然，这些要一下子解决也是不可能的，只有逐步解决。现在国家已经着手改进职工福利工作，这说明对职工的关怀，我们非常拥护。希望能够解决的及早解决。
