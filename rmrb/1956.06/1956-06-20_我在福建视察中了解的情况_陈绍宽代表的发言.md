My representatives of the people of Fujian Province fully agree with the "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget" made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council, the explanation of the draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives made by Minister Liao Luyan, and the work report of the Standing Committee made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on behalf of the Standing Committee. I also agree with the 1955 national final accounts, the 1956 national budget, and the draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives. From the 1955 national final accounts, it can be seen that China's national economy has made great progress in the past year. On this basis, in order to develop various construction undertakings in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and in accordance with the requirements of completing and overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the 1956 national budget was compiled. This budget is correct and fully conforms to the interests of the country and the people. The people of the whole country will actively support and ensure its realization. The draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives is a rewrite based on the draft Model Regulations used by the elementary cooperatives. Since the promulgation and trial implementation of the draft Model Regulations for elementary cooperatives last year, it has been proven to be feasible by practice in various places and has been unanimously approved by the vast number of farmers and universally adopted by agricultural cooperatives. Undoubtedly, after the promulgation of the draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives, it will surely be approved and adopted by the vast number of farmers and cooperatives, and will play a significant role in consolidating and improving cooperatives and developing agricultural production. We express our willingness to work hard for the implementation of the 1956 national budget and the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives! In the past year, the Standing Committee has actively carried out a lot of work in various aspects, and this work has been done very well with great achievements, and we express our satisfaction.

I am from Fujian, and I would like to make the following statement on the work in Fujian and the situation I learned during this inspection:

In 1956, while the socialist construction and socialist transformation undertakings in the whole country were developing rapidly, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Fujian also achieved great results on all work fronts in implementing the country's First Five-Year Plan. In particular, after implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "the question of agricultural cooperation" last autumn, the right-leaning conservative ideas were overcome, and the socialist enthusiasm of the farmers was brought into full play. A high tide of agricultural cooperation movement quickly and vigorously surged throughout the province, followed by a high tide of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts, as well as an agricultural production increase movement. At present, whether in urban or rural areas, the socialist front has occupied an absolute advantage, and the broad masses of people are confidently marching towards socialism!

In terms of agricultural cooperation, Fujian Province has now basically realized agricultural cooperation of a semi-socialist nature. Among them, those participating in advanced cooperatives account for more than 60% of the total number of peasant households. It is estimated that the agricultural cooperation in advanced forms can be basically completed this year, and the face of the rural small-peasant economy has been fundamentally changed. In the high tide of agricultural cooperation, through the publicity of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967 and the plan of Fujian Province on the implementation of this program, and due to the efforts of leading cadres at all levels in the province who went their separate ways and personally guided the work, a scene of joy and encouragement appeared everywhere, greatly improving the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers and stimulating the enthusiasm for socialist transformation. Those who originally thought that the mountainous areas had no future and complained about being born in the mountainous areas now see that the mountainous areas have all become "abundant in grains, prosperous in people and wealth, lush in forests, and herds of cattle and sheep." Those who originally thought that floods and droughts could not be resisted have now further clarified the truth of "man will conquer nature" and launched a large-scale water conservancy movement. Moving events of "townships competing with each other, everyone striving to be a model" have appeared everywhere.

Due to the realization of agricultural cooperation, the enormous productive forces in the countryside have been further developed and improved, fully demonstrating the superiority of agricultural cooperation. Therefore, although some areas suffered from severe natural disasters such as drought and insects last year, the total grain output of the province still increased compared with 1954, reaching 7.7 billion jin; other oil crops, industrial raw material crops, tea, and fruits all increased compared with 1954. This year's grain production increase plan is to increase production by 1.3 billion jin on the basis of last year, that is, to reach 9 billion jin, an increase of 16% over last year. This is a very arduous production task, but we have the confidence to do it. Last year, the province strengthened winter plowing, and this year's spring harvest crops have all achieved bumper harvests. Currently, the crops are growing strongly, and early rice has already flowered and set ears. It can be harvested in another two weeks, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The target of 9 billion jin of grain increase this year can be achieved. With the development of agricultural production, many agricultural cooperatives have increased their income, and some cooperatives have increased the income of 98% of their members.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts in Fujian, along with the great victory of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in major cities across the country, also implemented the socialist transformation of all industries in January this year and entered socialist society. Most of the private industrial and commercial enterprises in the province have been basically incorporated into the national plan.

Due to the implementation of the policy of serving agricultural production and combining with the rural economy, Fujian's local industry developed greatly in 1955. The province's local industry completed the national plan with a surplus of 10%, an increase of 50% compared with 1954. At the beginning of this year, after studying Chairman Mao's instructions, opposing right-leaning conservative ideas, and implementing the instructions of "overall planning, strengthening leadership, adopting basic measures, and promoting advanced experience," factories and enterprises across the province extensively launched labor competitions, further promoting production. After the revision of the total output value plan of the industrial system enterprises in the province, it increased by 49% compared with the original 1956 plan, exceeding the 1957 target of the First Five-Year Plan by 23.5%.

Fujian Province's largest Gutian Hydropower Station has completed the first phase of its project and sent electricity to Fuzhou on March 1st this year, officially putting it into production. It not only created good conditions for the development of the province's industry, but also cultivated a lot of talents for the country's water conservancy construction. In terms of national defense and transportation construction, the province mobilized and organized hundreds of thousands of military and civilian workers to invest in the tense Yingxia Railway, Nan'guan Railway, and other important national defense construction projects. It is expected that the Yingxia Railway will be open to traffic to Nanping in August, and the entire line will be open to traffic this year. The Nan'guan Railway will also be open to traffic in the first half of next year. The people of Fujian are very grateful and happy for the central government's hosting of the construction of these railways and the efforts of the railway soldiers. Decades of wishes have been realized since then. These two railways will play a significant role in developing Fujian's economy, consolidating national defense, and supporting the liberation of Taiwan.

Fujian is located in the subtropical region, where plants are easy to propagate, and mountains, forests, aquatic products, and minerals are abundant. Now agriculture and forestry are developing in large quantities. We hope that new factories can also be built and expanded in Fujian, underground minerals can be developed, and the potential power of local industrial production can be fully utilized, so that Fujian's economy can prosper rapidly and make more and greater contributions to the country's socialist construction.

Most of the handicrafts have implemented cooperation, fully demonstrating the superiority of being organized, improving labor productivity and product quality, reducing costs, and trial-producing many new products, which has strongly supported agricultural production and met the needs of supporting the front and exports.

Other aspects such as transportation, culture, education, and health have also made great progress.

Fujian is at the forefront of the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and the people of Fujian bear the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. Since Premier Zhou gave instructions on the Taiwan issue at the Second Session of the CPPCC, the people of Fujian have actively used various propaganda tools and various methods to launch propaganda to the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan and abroad about the lenient policy of the people of the motherland and the people's government towards them, and have done a lot of work on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan through the family members of Chiang Kai-shek's military and political personnel.

Fujian and Taiwan are only separated by a strait. The people of Fujian and the people of Taiwan have close ties. They are very concerned about the lives of the people of Taiwan and deeply hope to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, rescue the people of Taiwan from the abyss of suffering, and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. However, while striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, we, the people of Fujian, have never forgotten to actively support the People's Liberation Army in preparing to liberate Taiwan by war when necessary.

In the future, we, the people of Fujian, will work more closely with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, fully exploit the potential of all aspects and contribute all our strength on the basis of existing work achievements, continue to strengthen the work of supporting the front, and strive to complete the country's First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and win the victory of liberating Taiwan as soon as possible, and accelerate the completion of the great cause of socialism!

    我在福建视察中了解的情况
    ——陈绍宽代表的发言
    我代表福建全省人民对于李先念副总理代表国务院所作的“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，廖鲁言部长所作的关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明及彭真副委员长代表常务委员会所作的常务委员会的工作报告表示完全同意。对于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算及高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）我也一样地同意。从1955年国家决算中可以看出：我国国民经济在过去一年又有了很大发展。在此基础上，为了又多、又快、又好、又省的发展各项建设事业，并按照提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的要求而编造了1956年国家预算，这个预算是正确的，是完全符合国家和人民的利益的，全国人民一定会积极拥护和保证其实现。高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）是在初级合作社采用的示范章程（草案）的基础上改写的，初级社示范章程自去年公布试行以来，经过各地实践的证明是行得通的并且得到了广大农民的一致赞同，为农业合作社所普遍采用。无疑的，现在高级农业生产合作社示范章程公布后一定也会获得广大农民和合作社的赞同和采用，并对巩固提高合作社和发展农业生产将起重大作用。我们表示愿为1956年国家预算和高级农业生产合作社示范章程的实施而努力！过去一年来，常务委员会从各方面积极地进行了很多工作，这些工作做得很好，成绩是很大的，我们表示满意。
    我是从福建来的，我想就福建的工作及在这次视察中所了解的情况作如下的发言：
    1956年在全国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业迅速发展的同时，福建在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在执行国家的第一个五年计划的各个工作战线上亦取得了很大成绩。特别是经过去年秋季贯彻毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示后，克服了右倾保守思想，充分发挥了农民的社会主义积极性，在全省范围内，迅速蓬勃地涌起了农业合作化运动的高潮，接着又出现了对资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造以及农业增产运动的高潮。目前不论在城市或乡村，社会主义阵地已占绝对优势，广大人民正满怀信心地向社会主义迈进！
    在农业合作化方面，福建省现已基本上实现了半社会主义性质的农业合作化。其中参加高级社的占总农户的60％以上，估计今年可基本上完成高级形式的农业合作化，农村小农经济的面貌已经根本改观了。在农业合作化的高潮中，通过1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）及福建省关于执行这个纲要的规划的宣传，和由于本省各级领导干部分途努力，亲自指导，到处都出现了一片欢欣鼓舞的景象，大大提高了广大农民的社会主义觉悟，激发了社会主义改造的积极性。原来认为山区没有前途，埋怨自己生在山区的，现在也看到了山区全变成“五谷丰登，人财两旺，森林茂盛，牛羊成群”，原来认为水旱灾害无法抵抗的，现在进一步明确了“人定胜天”的道理，开展了大规模的兴修水利运动，到处出现了“乡乡闹竞赛，人人争模范”的动人事例。
    由于农业合作化的实现，农村中的巨大生产力得到进一步的发展和提高，充分显示了农业合作化的优越性，因此，去年虽然部分地区遭受了严重的旱、虫等自然灾害，但全省粮食总产量还能比1954年增产，达到77亿斤；其他油料作物、工业原料作物、茶叶、果产等都比1954年增产。今年粮食增产计划在去年的基础上增产13亿斤，即达到90亿斤，较去年增产16％，这是非常艰巨的生产任务，但是我们有信心可以做到。去年全省加强了冬耕，今年春收作物都获得丰收，目前庄稼健壮，早稻已经扬花结穗，再过两星期就可收割，丰收在望。今年粮食增产90亿斤的指标是可以完成的。随着农业生产的发展，不少农业社都增加了收入，有的社有98％社员增加了收入。
    福建对资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造，随着北京市资本主义工商业社会主义改造的伟大胜利，和全国各大城市资本主义工商业的社会主义改造一样，于今年一月起也实行了全行业的社会主义改造，进入了社会主义社会。全省绝大部分私营工商业已基本纳入国家计划轨道。
    由于贯彻了为农业生产服务与农村经济相结合的方针，1955年福建地方工业有了很大发展，全省地方工业以超额10％完成国家计划，较1954年增长50％。今年初，学习了毛主席的指示，反对右倾保守思想，并贯彻“全面规划，加强领导，采取基本措施，推广先进经验”的指示后，各工厂企业广泛开展了劳动竞赛，进一步推动了生产。全省工业系统企业总产值计划修订后，较原来的1956年计划增加49％，超过第一个五年计划的1957年指标的23.5％。
    福建省最大的古田水电站已经完成了第一期工程，于今年三月一日送电到福州，正式投入生产。它不仅为本省工业发展创造了良好条件，而且为国家水利建设培养了不少人才。在国防和交通建设方面，全省动员和组织了几十万军工、民工投入紧张的鹰厦铁路和南琯铁路以及其他重要国防修建工程。预计鹰厦铁路八月份可通车到南平，在本年内可全线通车，南琯铁路在明年上半年也可全线通车。福建人民对中央主持这些铁路的修建和铁道兵部队的努力非常感激和高兴，数十年的愿望从此实现了。这两条铁路对发展福建的经济及巩固国防支援解放台湾等都将起重大作用。
    福建系在亚热带地区，植物繁殖容易，山林、水产、矿藏均属丰富，现在农林业正在大量发展，我们希望也可以在福建新建和扩建工厂，开发地下矿藏，充分发挥地方工业生产的潜在力量，使福建经济迅速繁荣起来，对于国家的社会主义建设做出更多更大的贡献。
    手工业大部分已实行了合作化，充分显示了组织起来的优越性，提高了劳动生产率和产品质量，降低了成本，并试制了不少新产品，有力的支援了农业生产及满足了支前和出口的需要。
    其他如交通运输、文教卫生等，也都有很大的发展。
    福建处在解放台湾斗争的最前线，福建人民担负着解放台湾的光荣任务。自从周总理在政协第二次会议上指示台湾问题之后，福建人民即积极运用各种宣传工具和通过各种方式向在台湾和国外的国民党军政人员展开宣传祖国人民和人民政府对待他们的宽大政策，并通过蒋介石的军政人员的家属作了许多和平解放台湾的工作。
    福建与台湾仅一海峡之隔，福建人民与台湾人民有密切的联系，他们很关心台湾人民的生活，深切地期望着早日解放台湾，把台湾人民从水深火热中拯救出来，早日回到祖国怀抱。但在争取和平解放台湾的同时，我们福建人民时刻也没有忘记要积极支援人民解放军准备在必要的时候用战争方式解放台湾。
    今后，我们福建人民更加紧密地和全国人民一道，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，在现有工作成就的基础上充分发挥各方面的潜力和贡献一切力量，继续加强支前工作，为提前完成国家第一个五年计划和争取早日解放台湾的胜利，为加速完成社会主义的伟大事业而奋斗！
