    A large Tuckahoe (茯苓, *Fúlíng*), weighing over fifty jin (approximately 25 kilograms) and with a diameter of one chi three cun (approximately 43 centimeters), is currently on display at the Traditional Chinese Medicine Exhibition Room of the Kunming Workers' Cultural Palace and will soon be transported to Beijing for exhibition.

    This large Tuckahoe, the first of its kind ever discovered in Yunnan, was unearthed by a farmer in Xun甸县 (Xundian County) this year. It is three to four times larger than ordinary Tuckahoe. Visitors are calling it the "Tuckahoe King."

    Yunnan Province, including the minority areas of Li江 (Lijiang), Wei西 (Weixi), Chu雄 (Chuxiong), Yuan江 (Yuanjiang), and Xun甸 (Xundian), is rich in Tuckahoe production, with an annual output of over 300,000 jin. Varieties such as 小京庄 (Xiao Jingzhuang), 提平苓 (Ti Ping Ling), 大面苓 (Da Mian Ling), and the 雪茯 (Xue Fu) produced in 琅琊山 (Langya Mountain) in Teng冲 County have long been sold to other provinces. Tuckahoe is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine with functions such as dispelling dampness, eliminating stagnation, and strengthening the spleen and stomach. It belongs to the fungal category, parasitizes in the soil under pine trees, and grows into a lumpy shape after many years, making it difficult to excavate. Currently, a Miao farmer in Ma龙县 (Malong County), Yunnan Province, is applying Tuckahoe paste to the cut roots of pine trees, allowing the Tuckahoe to grow in a fixed location. This method of cultivating Tuckahoe has begun to be promoted in the Tuckahoe-producing areas of Yunnan.

    一个五十多斤的茯苓
    新华社讯　一个重五十多斤、直径有一市尺三寸的大茯苓，正在昆明市工人文化宫的中药材展览室里陈列着，不久将运往北京展出。
    这个云南有史以来第一次发现的大茯苓，是寻甸县一个农民今年在山野里挖出的，它比一般茯苓大三、四倍以上，参观的人们都叫它为“茯苓王”。
    云南省丽江、维西、楚雄、元江、寻甸等少数民族地区都盛产茯苓，年产量达三十多万斤，其中小京庄、提平苓、大面苓以及腾冲县琅琊山出产的雪茯等品种历来远销省外。茯苓是具有除湿、消积及裸脾胃等功用的常用中药。它属于菌类，寄生在松树下的泥土里，经过多年的生长才成块状，不易挖掘。现在，云南省马龙县的一个苗族农民，用茯苓浆抹在割破的松树根上，使茯苓可以在固定的地点生长。这种培植茯苓的办法，已经在云南茯苓产区开始推广。
