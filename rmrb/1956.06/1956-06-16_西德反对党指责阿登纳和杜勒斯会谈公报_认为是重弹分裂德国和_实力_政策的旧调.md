Xinhua News Agency, Bonn: West German opposition parties are dissatisfied with the Adenauer and Dulles' communiqué.
    The Social Democratic Party's press office released a commentary on the 14th stating that Adenauer and Dulles' attempt to annex the German Democratic Republic is unrealistic. They also failed to consider West Germany's special position, and West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is one of the biggest obstacles to German reunification.
    The Free Democratic Party and the Refugee Party also complained in their commentaries that the Adenauer and Dulles' communiqué only repeated the old tune of advocating a "policy of strength," and did not take any new steps on the German issue.
    Wehner, Chairman of the All-German Affairs Committee of the West German Federal Parliament, said in a statement to the press that Adenauer's "policy of only using tough language" will slow down the easing of tensions, thereby fixing the division of Germany.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington: The Adenauer and Dulles talks ended on June 13th, and a communiqué was issued. Adenauer and Dulles did not put forward any suggestions in their joint communiqué that would help resolve the issue of German reunification, but only reiterated the old plan of the Western countries to annex the German Democratic Republic through so-called "free elections."
    Adenauer and Dulles re-advocated the importance of the North Atlantic military bloc. They assured that the two governments will support the decisions made at the recent Council meeting in Paris to strengthen this bloc.
    They studied the letters written by Bulganin to the heads of government of various Western countries and considered that the "appropriate" step was to discuss the matter jointly with other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    At a press conference held after the communiqué was issued, Adenauer reiterated that West Germany would make a "full" military contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He also requested that American and British troops continue to remain on West German territory.
    Adenauer said that West Germany would not negotiate with the Soviet Union alone on the issue of German reunification. This issue involves the three Western powers, and negotiations with the Soviet Union are only possible with the participation of the United States, Britain, and France.

    西德反对党指责阿登纳和杜勒斯会谈公报
    认为是重弹分裂德国和“实力”政策的旧调
    据新华社讯　波恩消息：西德各反对党不满意阿登纳和杜勒斯的会谈公报。
    社会民主党新闻处十四日发表评论说，阿登纳和杜勒斯坚持吞并德意志民主共和国的企图是不现实的。他们也没有把西德的特殊地位考虑进去，西德参加北大西洋集团是对德国统一的最大障碍之一。
    自由民主党和难民党在评论中也抱怨阿登纳和杜勒斯的会谈公报只是重复了鼓吹“实力”政策的老调，没有在德国问题上采取任何新的步骤。
    西德联邦议院全德事务委员会主席魏纳在向新闻界发表的谈话中说：阿登纳的“只用强硬的言语的政策”将减慢紧张局势缓和的速度，从而将固定德国的分裂。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：阿登纳和杜勒斯的会谈已经在六月十三日结束，并发表了公报。阿登纳和杜勒斯在他们联合公报中没有提出任何有助于解决德国统一问题的建议，而只是重申西方国家过去企图以所谓“自由选举”来并吞德意志民主共和国的老方案。
    阿登纳和杜勒斯重新鼓吹北大西洋军事集团的重要性。他们保证，两国政府将支持最近在巴黎举行的理事会会议作出的决定，以加强这个集团。
    他们研究了布尔加宁写给各西方国家政府首脑的信件，认为“适宜的”步骤是同北大西洋集团的其他会员国共同讨论这件事。
    在公报发表以后举行的记者招待会上，阿登纳重申西德将对北大西洋集团作出“充分的”军事贡献。他还要求美国和英国的军队继续留在西德领土上。
    阿登纳说，西德不会单独同苏联谈判有关德国统一的问题，这个问题牵涉到西方三国，只有在美、英、法参加下才可能同苏联举行谈判。
