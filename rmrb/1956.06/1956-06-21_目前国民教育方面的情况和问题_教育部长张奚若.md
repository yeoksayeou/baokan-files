I fully agree with Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and I suggest that the Congress approve the national budget and final accounts, and adopt the model regulations of advanced agricultural production cooperatives and the work report of the Standing Committee.

Now I would like to talk about the main situation and some specific problems in national education. The achievements of the national education cause have completed the plans for general and normal education, improved the quality of teaching materials and teachers, and improved the treatment of teachers nationwide.

In the past year, like all other undertakings, the cause of national education has undergone tremendous changes with the arrival of the upsurge of socialist revolution, and the cause of general education and normal education in the country has achieved certain results under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

First, the 1955 plan for general education and normal education was completed. Higher normal schools completed 101.4% of their enrollment targets, normal schools completed 101.3% of their enrollment targets, middle schools completed 102% of their enrollment targets, and primary schools completed 109% of their enrollment targets. What is particularly worth mentioning here is the work of eliminating illiteracy. Since the second half of 1955, with the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement, various localities have adopted positive measures to eliminate illiteracy. Many provincial and municipal Party committees and governments have issued instructions on the work of eliminating illiteracy, held meetings on literacy work, widely used newspapers, periodicals, radio and other tools for publicity, generally formulated plans for eliminating illiteracy, established literacy associations and literacy work teams, and organized millions of volunteer teachers to form a literacy army. Many places have compiled literacy textbooks popular among farmers. At present, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and peasants is very high, and they are universally and enthusiastically signing up to participate in learning. Especially during this year's Spring Festival, many mobilizations and organizational work were carried out in various places, and the number of students enrolled has increased greatly. According to preliminary statistics, the number of workers participating in spare-time cultural studies in various places this spring has reached 4 million; the number of farmers participating in spare-time cultural studies has reached 62 million. Compared with the figures at the end of 1955, the number of workers participating in learning has increased by more than 1 million; the number of farmers participating in learning has increased by more than 10 million. The scale of this movement of workers and peasants to fundamentally change their cultural status is an unprecedented and impossible phenomenon in Chinese history.

Secondly, some work has also been done to improve the quality of education. Here, I will only talk about two main issues: improving the quality of teaching materials and teachers. In terms of improving the quality of teaching materials, we have revised the original editing plan. According to the original plan, the teaching syllabus, textbooks and teaching reference books for primary and secondary schools and normal schools would not be completed until 1959. The revised plan stipulates that the original editing tasks will be completed two years earlier, in 1957. We have now completed half of the editing plan. Among them, Chinese language and literature have been divided into subjects and new textbooks have been compiled, which is a major reform in Chinese language teaching in our country. In terms of improving the quality of teachers and school leaders, we have begun to adopt various methods of on-the-job learning and off-the-job training. By the end of 1955, the number of primary and secondary school teachers participating in spare-time refresher schools and correspondence courses nationwide had reached 200,000, and the number participating in training courses was 90,000. In the autumn of 1955, the Educational Administration College was established in Beijing. Most provinces and cities have also successively established training classes or schools for educational administrative cadres, and concentrated school leaders and educational administrative cadres in batches to improve their political and professional levels for half a year to a year. At the same time, work was carried out among teachers to publicize materialism, criticize bourgeois idealism, and eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, further improving the socialist consciousness and revolutionary vigilance of all teachers. Especially with the arrival of the upsurge of socialist revolution, the socialist consciousness and work enthusiasm of the broad masses of teachers across the country have been unprecedentedly improved. Many teachers actively and enthusiastically demand to do more work and come up with many ways to improve the quality of education. In addition to striving to improve their policy level and do a good job in school leadership, many school leaders also require to teach a certain number of courses concurrently. Teachers in many areas have consciously put forward various initiatives and rationalization proposals to accelerate the development of education and improve the quality of education. For example, the teachers' representatives of Jiangxi Province, in the initiative put forward at the 1956 teachers' annual meeting, only used the method of tapping the existing potential of secondary schools in the province, and could enroll 420 more classes of students without increasing teachers and classroom equipment. There are many similar examples in other places. This enthusiasm is very valuable. This is a positive factor in the socialist construction cause, and it is very beneficial to the development of the education construction cause, and should be supported and encouraged.

The Party and the People's Government are very concerned about the lives of teachers. In order to improve the salary treatment of teachers across the country, the wage reform plan passed at the 32nd meeting of the State Council on June 16 this year has greatly increased the salary standards of existing teachers. According to regulations, the average monthly salary of teachers and staff of various undertakings under the Ministry of Education will increase by an average of 28.72% after the adjustment, that is, from 33.93 yuan to 43.67 yuan. The salary standards of primary school teachers have been increased even more, and the average monthly salary will increase by an average of 32.88% after the adjustment, that is, from 30.2 yuan to 40.13 yuan. According to this new standard, the salary treatment of teachers has been improved a step further than in the past. We believe that in the future, with the development of the national economy, the salary treatment of teachers will gradually increase. The outstanding problems in current general education are insufficient number of middle school students, a large number of dropouts from primary and secondary schools, and normal education cannot keep up with the needs.

Although our national education work has achieved certain results in the past year, on the whole, it is still far behind the requirements of socialist construction and far behind the needs of developing production. At present, illiteracy still accounts for 78% of the total population; the number of school-age children who have already entered school only accounts for a little more than 52%. In addition, the most prominent problem in general education at present is the lack of middle school students, which seriously affects the needs of national construction. According to preliminary planning materials, the number of high school graduates will not be able to meet the enrollment quota of colleges and universities until 1958, and in 1959, the ratio of college and university enrollment to high school graduates will only be 1:1.23. Judging from the aspect of junior high school graduates, a false impression appeared in the past two years, as if there were some surplus of junior high school graduates. In fact, some junior high school graduates and some parents have the wrong idea of ​​despising physical labor and physical laborers, and are unwilling to participate in productive labor, and simply demand to enter school. At that time, it was impossible for all junior high school graduates to enter school, so a tense situation once occurred in the summer and autumn of 1954 and 1955. However, starting this year, all parties have felt that there are not enough junior high school graduates. The estimated number of junior high school graduates in 1956 is 787,073. Even if all of them enter school, they cannot completely meet the enrollment figures of senior high schools and secondary vocational schools (senior high schools enroll 366,120 people; secondary vocational schools enroll 421,596 people). As for the 300,000 junior high school graduates needed by various industrial and agricultural production departments this year, it is even more impossible to solve them with this year's junior high school graduates. The number of junior high school graduates in 1957 can only barely meet the needs of senior high school enrollment, and the needs of industrial and agricultural production departments still cannot be met. This is a serious problem that we need to solve vigorously in the future.

In addition, the current phenomenon of a large number of primary and secondary school students dropping out and suspending school is also a very serious problem. According to preliminary statistics in 1955, the number of primary school students who dropped out of school halfway across the country reached 5.1 million, and the number of junior high school students reached 150,000. According to incomplete statistics from 189 middle schools in 7 provinces, including Hunan, Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Fujian, the number of students who dropped out and suspended school from the beginning of this spring semester to the end of February reached 9,499. In the first semester of this year, the number of dropouts and suspensions in general primary and secondary schools was more than 10%, and in some places, the number of middle school students dropping out and suspending school was as high as 50%. This situation is very serious. The reasons why this phenomenon seems particularly serious now are various. The main reason is that after agricultural cooperation, due to the development of production by farmers, they urgently require young students to return to their hometowns to participate in productive labor; secondly, some people cannot solve the problem of school expenses for a while. To fundamentally solve the problem of primary and secondary school students dropping out and suspending school, of course, it is necessary to vigorously develop primary and secondary schools to meet the needs of farmers to develop production. However, this is not something that can be done all at once. Therefore, this phenomenon must be stopped quickly at present. Otherwise, if it is allowed to develop, it will seriously affect the development of higher education and secondary education, hinder the realization of the national plan to train construction talents, and cause great difficulties to the country's economic construction. However, this is a social problem. To correct this phenomenon, in addition to the education department finding ways to solve it, it is also hoped that all parties can give support and assistance in order to effectively eliminate the phenomenon of a large number of primary and secondary school students dropping out and suspending school and consolidate the students in school. For students who have already dropped out and suspended school, except for a few people with special difficulties, their parents should be persuaded to encourage students to return to school to study from the perspective of the overall needs and long-term interests of the country. For those who have difficulties in continuing their studies, various localities should also provide appropriate care and help to solve their difficulties according to the specific circumstances.

Now, let me talk about another serious problem currently existing in education construction. That is, normal education cannot adapt to the urgent needs of general education. With the development of general education, the problem of insufficient teachers in primary and secondary schools is becoming increasingly serious. It has become a major difficulty in the development of education at present. It is estimated that in 1956 and 1957, there will be a shortage of about 90,000 middle school teachers and about 200,000 primary school teachers. Obviously, this problem is very serious. The Ministry of Education is currently studying how to solve this problem. The solution to the shortage of middle school teachers, in addition to graduates of higher normal schools, will be to promote some outstanding primary school teachers and outstanding graduates of normal schools to serve as junior high school teachers; the solution to the shortage of primary school teachers, in addition to graduates of normal schools, will be to appropriately develop junior normal schools and short-term normal classes. In addition, attention should also be paid to tapping the potential human resources in society and schools to meet the urgent needs of developing primary and secondary school education. We also hope to get assistance from all sectors of society in this work.

Since the second half of 1955, a climax of socialist revolution has appeared in our country. The great victory of socialist transformation has brought about fundamental changes in our country's political situation. This new situation has put forward solemn new tasks for all undertakings in our country, and it has also put forward solemn new tasks for the cause of national education. That is to require us to adapt to the requirements of the national socialist revolution and socialist construction, realize the cultural revolution, eliminate illiteracy during the transition period, popularize education, and universally improve the political and cultural level of the people, so that the broad masses of people across the country can become cultured and educated people. At the same time, we must also train a large number of socialist intellectual cadres to meet the widespread needs of socialist construction. The main tasks in the next few years are to basically eliminate illiteracy, universalize primary school education, and train a large number of teachers.

According to the new tasks put forward by this new situation for the cause of national education, and in accordance with the principles of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" and "faster, more, better, and more economical" instructed by Chairman Mao, we believe that the following main tasks should be realized in the cause of national education in the future: (1) Starting from 1956, according to the local conditions, basically eliminate illiteracy within five or seven years or a longer period of time. And in the next seven to twelve years, on the basis of literacy education, continue to improve the cultural level of cadres, workers, peasants and urban residents, so that most of them reach the primary school graduation level, some reach the junior high school graduation level, and some reach the senior high school graduation level; (2) Starting from 1956, according to the local conditions, popularize primary school education in general towns and villages within seven or twelve years respectively; gradually transition to popularizing junior high school education in municipalities directly under the Central Government, municipalities under provincial jurisdiction, and industrial cities. And on the basis of popularizing education, vigorously develop secondary school education, in order to gradually meet the needs of training talents for national construction; (3) Vigorously develop and run normal education well, and train a large number of teachers for secondary schools, primary schools and kindergartens. It is required that within the next twelve years, senior high school teachers will basically be filled by personnel with the degree of graduation from normal colleges, junior high school teachers will basically be filled by personnel with the degree of graduation from normal junior colleges, senior primary school teachers will basically be filled by personnel with the degree of graduation from normal schools, and junior primary school teachers will basically be filled by personnel with the degree of graduation from junior normal schools.

In the past six months, we have been formulating an overall plan for the cause of national education in accordance with the above-mentioned principles and tasks. In the process of formulating the plan, we have been constantly striving to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. Literacy work should be carried out in stages and in batches according to specific circumstances.

In the past, the development speed of eliminating illiteracy was too slow. The number of illiterate farmers planned to be eliminated in 1955 was only 3.08 million, which was less than 2% of the total number of illiterate farmers aged 14 to 50 in the country. The direct reason for this situation is that after correcting the "blindly advancing" deviation in eliminating illiteracy in 1953, many cadres had an unclear understanding of the meaning and boundaries of "blindly advancing," resulting in serious negative and retreating emotions. Although the National Conference on Farmers' Spare-time Cultural Education held in August 1954 basically corrected this deviation, the specific plans formulated later were still too conservative. Therefore, the work of eliminating illiteracy was in a state of stagnation for a long time. There has also been a conservative tendency in the development of primary school education in the past three years. Although primary schools have developed to a certain extent in 1955, the proportion of development is too small. Compared with 1952, the actual increase in the three years is only 4%. In terms of normal education, in the past, in addition to the rapid development in higher normal education, not enough attention was paid to the development of normal schools. In particular, the inappropriate reduction of the enrollment quota of normal schools in recent years, and the contraction of junior normal schools, has increased the difficulty of today's shortage of primary school teachers. The reason why these situations have occurred is mainly due to the serious right-leaning conservative thinking in the past work. Through this overall plan, we have strictly checked the past work, analyzed and criticized the past shortcomings and errors, and resolutely overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking in various undertakings. This has improved our guiding ideology a step further. At present, except for some individual areas where there are still some negative and conservative emotions, a hot wave of welcoming cultural construction has appeared in the vast areas of the country, which has created extremely favorable conditions for the development of the cause of national education. However, recently, varying degrees of impatience and adventurism have emerged in various places, which is particularly serious in the work of eliminating illiteracy. Since the central government proposed the deadline of basically eliminating illiteracy within five or seven years, most provinces and cities have shortened the deadline for eliminating illiteracy to four to five years. Many industrial systems stipulate that illiteracy among employees should be eliminated in two to two and a half years. As for the grassroots units, they require even faster than the provinces and cities, so that some cadres responsible for eliminating illiteracy in some areas have forced orders in order to catch up with the tasks. For example, some places have adopted the method of deducting work points or punishing people who do not participate in learning; some places have set up "literacy posts" and "literacy checkpoints" everywhere to force people to learn. These wrong practices are harmful to production, to people's health, and to the development of literacy work.

There are certainly many reasons for this situation, but it is related to the fact that the leaders of the Ministry of Education themselves are a little overheated. For example, at the National Conference on Spare-time Education for Employees held by us, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in December 1955, we proposed that we should eliminate illiteracy among existing employees in the next two or three years (later, the "Decision on Eliminating Illiteracy" of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council set it at three or five years), which clearly reveals our impatience. We have also demanded too much too quickly in terms of popularizing compulsory primary education. Especially at the beginning of this year, we had a great enthusiasm for developing various education undertakings and demanded too quickly, which directly contributed to the impatience of the education administrative departments of various provinces and cities, so that they tightened the deadline for completing tasks at all levels and put forward excessive and high demands. The Ministry of Education bears a certain responsibility for this problem. At the same time, this is also a lesson we need to deeply remember. In the future, all our work must be placed on a solid and reliable foundation, as Vice Premier Li Xiannian said. While opposing conservatism, we must also oppose the tendency of impatience and adventurism. Because "the result of impatience and adventurism cannot help the development of the socialist cause, but can only lead to losses."

For this reason, I would like to specifically point out here: At present, the work of eliminating illiteracy in general areas and factories and mining enterprises should be carried out in stages and in batches according to specific circumstances; the deadline for eliminating illiteracy should not be required too short or too urgent. The deadline for eliminating illiteracy among employees should be determined according to the specific conditions of each region and industry. The originally stipulated deadline that is too short and too tight can be appropriately extended. If the deadline for eliminating illiteracy among farmers and urban residents is stipulated too short and too tight, it can also be appropriately extended. At the same time, we must adhere to the principle of voluntary learning and quickly overcome the phenomenon of forced orders, so that the work of eliminating illiteracy can develop smoothly and healthily.

Similarly, if there are other undertakings in the cause of national education that require too much too quickly, they should also be corrected in accordance with this spirit, and attention should be paid to gradually realizing the undertaking plan in stages, in batches, and by region according to the specific circumstances of each place.

Dear representatives! Although we have achieved certain results in national education work, as I said just now, there are still many shortcomings and problems. I hope that all representatives and the people of the whole country will frequently give us criticisms and opinions, urge and help us overcome shortcomings and solve difficulties, so that we can smoothly complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the country and the people.

    目前国民教育方面的情况和问题
    ——教育部长张奚若
    我完全同意李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”、廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”、彭真副委员长关于“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”，并且建议大会批准国家预决算，通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程和常务委员会的工作报告。
    现在我想来讲一讲目前国民教育方面的主要情况和若干具体问题。国民教育事业的成绩完成了普通和师范教育计划提高了教材和教师的质量改善了全国教师的待遇
    在过去一年中间，国民教育事业和其他各项事业一样，随着社会主义革命高潮的到来，发生了极大的变化，全国普通教育和师范教育事业在党中央和国务院的领导下取得了一定的成绩。
    首先完成了1955年普通教育和师范教育的事业计划。高等师范学校完成了招生任务的101.4％，师范学校完成了招生任务的101.3％，中学完成了招生任务的102％，小学完成了招生任务的109％。这里特别值得提出的是扫除文盲工作。自从1955年下半年开始，随着农业合作化运动的高涨，各地对扫除文盲工作采取了积极的措施。很多省、市党委和政府发出了扫除文盲工作指示，召开了扫盲工作会议，广泛利用报纸、刊物、广播等工具进行宣传，普遍制定了扫除文盲规划，成立了扫除文盲协会和扫除文盲工作队，组织了数百万义务教师的扫盲大军。很多地方已经编出了受农民欢迎的识字课本。目前广大工农群众的热情很高，普遍踊跃地报名参加学习。特别是在今年春节期间，各地又进行了许多动员和组织工作，入学人数又有了很大的增加。据初步统计，今年春季各地参加业余文化学习的职工人数已达400万；参加业余文化学习的农民人数已达6，200 万。和1955年年底的数字相比，职工参加学习的人数增加了100多万；农民参加学习的人数增加了1，000多万。这个工农群众在文化上大翻身的运动的规模是中国历史上空前未有也不可能有的现象。
    其次，在提高教育质量方面也做了一些工作。这里只就提高教材和教师质量两个主要问题来谈一下。在提高教材质量的工作方面，我们已经修改了原定的编辑计划。按照原定计划，中小学和师范学校的教学大纲、教科书和教学参考书，要在1959年才能完成全部编辑任务。而修改后的计划规定提前两年即在1957年全部完成原定的编辑任务。现在我们已经完成了编辑计划完成数的一半。其中汉语和文学已经分科编出了新课本，这是我国汉语教学上的一个重大改革。在提高教师和学校领导干部的质量的工作方面，我们已经开始采用了各种在职学习和离职轮训的办法。截止到1955年底，全国参加业余进修学校和函授学习的中小学教师已达到20万人，参加轮训班的有9万人。1955年秋季在北京成立了教育行政学院。多数省市也先后成立了教育行政干部训练班或教育行政干部学校，分批集中学校领导干部和教育行政干部，利用半年至一年的时间提高他们的政治业务水平。同时在教师中进行了宣传唯物主义批判资产阶级唯心主义思想的工作和肃清反革命分子的运动，进一步提高了全体教师的社会主义觉悟和革命警惕性。特别是随着社会主义革命高潮的到来，全国广大教师的社会主义觉悟和工作积极性空前提高了，许多教师积极地热情地要求多做工作，想出许多办法去提高教育质量。许多学校领导干部，除了努力提高政策水平、搞好学校领导工作以外，还要求兼任一定时数的课程。许多地区的教师已经自觉地提出加速发展教育事业和提高教育质量的各种倡议和合理化建议。例如江西省的教师代表，在1956年教师年会上提出的倡议中，仅仅用挖掘全省中等学校现有潜力一项办法，就可以在不增加教师和教室设备的条件下，多招收学生420个班。其他各地也有不少类似的事例。这种热情是十分可贵的。这是社会主义建设事业中的积极因素，它对教育建设事业的发展是很有利的，应该给予支持和鼓励。
    党和人民政府对教师的生活是非常关怀的。为了改善全国教师的工资待遇，在今年6月16日国务院第三十二次会议上通过的工资改革方案中，对于现有教师的工资标准有了较多的提高。按规定，教育部所属各项事业的教职员工每月平均工资，调整后将比调整前平均增高28.72％，即由33.93元增加到43.67元。其中小学教员的工资标准提高得还要多一些，每月平均工资在调整后将比调整前增高32.88％，即由30.2元增加到40.13元。按照这个新的标准，教师的工资待遇是比过去提高了一步。我们相信，以后随着国民经济的发展，教师的工资待遇还会逐步提高。当前普通教育的突出问题中学学生数目不足中小学学生大量退学师范教育赶不上需要
    一年来，我们的国民教育工作虽然取得了一定的成绩，但是，整个说来，还远远落后于社会主义建设的要求，大大落后于发展生产的需要。目前全国文盲还占总人口的78％；全国学龄儿童已经入学的也只占52％多一点。除此以外，当前在普通教育方面最突出的一个问题，就是中学生不足，严重影响国家建设的需要。根据初步计划材料来看，高中毕业生一直到1958年都不能满足高等学校招生的数额，到1959年，高等学校招生同高中毕业生相比，也只是1∶1.23。从初中毕业生方面看，前两年出现过一种假象，好像是初中毕业生有些过剩，实际上是有些初中毕业生和部分家长由于存在着轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的错误思想，不愿意参加生产劳动，单纯要求升学，而当时初中毕业生又不可能全部升学，因此，曾经在1954和1955年夏秋之际出现过紧张状况。但是，从今年起，各方面都已经感觉到初中毕业生不够了。1956年初中毕业生数预计为787，073 人，即使全部升学也不能完全满足高级中学和中等专业学校的招生数字（高级中学招生366，120人；中等专业学校招生421，596人）。至于工农业各个生产部门今年需要的30万名初中毕业生，那就更不能用今年的初中毕业生来解决了。1957年初中毕业生只能勉强满足高级中等学校招生的需要，对于工农业生产部门的需要仍然不能满足。这是我们今后需要大力解决的一个严重问题。
    此外，目前中小学学生大量退学休学的现象也是一个非常严重的问题。据1955年初步统计，全国学校中途辍学的小学生达510万人，初中学生达15万人。据湖南、江苏、河北、河南、吉林、黑龙江、福建等7省189所中学不完全的统计，从今年春季开学到二月底为止，退学休学的学生即达到9，499人。今年上学期一般中小学学生退学休学人数都在10％以上，有些地方中学生退学休学的人数竟达50％以上。这种情况是十分严重的。这种现象在现在之所以显得特别严重，有种种原因，主要是在农业合作化以后，由于农民发展生产，迫切要求青年学生回乡参加生产劳动；其次是有些人一时还不能解决上学的费用问题。要从根本上解决中小学学生退学休学问题，当然是要大量发展中小学来满足农民群众发展生产的需要。但是，这不是一
  下子就能办到的事。所以，目前还必须迅速制止这种现象。否则，让它发展下去，就会严重影响高等教育和中等教育的发展，妨碍国家培养建设人才计划的实现，给国家经济建设造成很大的困难。不过，这是一个带有社会性的问题。要纠正这一现象，除教育部门设法解决以外，还希望各方面能够给以支持和协助，以便有效地消除中小学学生大量退学休学的现象，巩固在校学生。对已经退学休学的学生，除少数有特殊困难的人以外，应当说服他们的父母，从国家的整个需要和长远利益着眼，鼓励学生回校学习。对继续上学有困难的，各地还应当根据具体情况，给予适当照顾，帮助解决困难。
    现在，我再来谈谈在教育建设事业上，目前存在的另一个严重问题。这就是师范教育不能适应普通教育的迫切需要。随着普通教育事业的发展，中小学师资不够的问题越来越显得严重。它已经成为目前教育事业发展中的一个主要困难。在1956和1957两年内，估计中学师资缺少约9万人左右，小学师资缺少约20万人左右。很显然，这个问题是十分严重的。现在教育部正在研究解决这个问题。解决中学师资缺额问题的办法，除了高等师范学校毕业生以外，将要提拔一些优秀的小学教师和师范学校的优秀毕业生担任初中教师；解决小学师资缺额问题的办法，除了师范学校毕业生以外，将要适当发展初级师范学校和短期师范班。另外，还要注意发掘社会和学校方面的潜在人力，以满足发展中小学教育的迫切需要。这一方面的工作我们也希望能够得到社会各方面的协助。
    从1955年下半年开始，我国出现了社会主义革命的高潮。社会主义改造的伟大胜利，使得我国的政治形势发生了根本的变化。这个新的形势给我国各项事业提出了庄严的新任务，它同样也给国民教育事业提出了庄严的新任务。这就是要求我们必须适应国家社会主义革命和社会主义建设的要求，实现文化革命，在过渡时期内扫除文盲，普及教育，普遍提高人民群众的政治文化水平，使全国广大人民群众成为有文化有教养的人。同时还要大量培养社会主义的知识分子干部，满足社会主义建设事业的广泛需要。今后几项主要工作基本上扫除文盲普及小学教育培养大量师资
    根据这个新形势给国民教育事业所提出的新任务，遵照毛主席指示的“全面规划，加强领导”和“又快、又多、又好、又省”的方针，我们认为今后国民教育事业应当实现下列几项主要任务：（一）从1956年开始，按照各地情况，分别在五年或者七年或者较长年限内基本上扫除文盲。并且在今后七年到十二年内，在识字教育的基础上，继续提高干部、工人、农民和市民的文化水平，使他们大部分达到小学毕业程度，部分达到初中毕业程度，部分达到高中毕业程度；（二）从1956年开始，按照各地情况，分别在七年或者十二年内，在一般城镇和乡村普及小学教育；在直辖市、省辖市、工业城市逐步过渡到普及初中教育。并且在普及教育的基础上，大力发展中学教育，以期逐步满足培养国家建设人才的需要；（三）大力发展和办好师范教育，培养大量的中等学校、初等学校和幼儿园的师资。要求在今后十二年内，高级中学师资基本上由师范学院毕业程度的人员充任，初级中学师资基本上由师范专科学校毕业程度的人员充任，高级小学师资基本上由师范学校毕业程度的人员充任，初级小学师资基本上由初级师范学校毕业程度的人员充任。
    这半年来我们就是按照上述方针任务拟订国民教育事业的全面规划的。在制定规划的过程中，我们是在不断地努力克服右倾保守思想。扫盲工作应根据具体情况
    分期分批进行
    过去扫除文盲工作的发展速度过于迟缓。1955年计划扫除的农民文盲数只有308万，还不及全国14岁到50岁农民文盲总数的2％。造成这一情况的直接原因是1953年纠正了扫除文盲工作方面“盲目冒进”的偏向以后，不少干部对“盲目冒进”的含义和界限认识不清，产生了严重的消极退缩情绪。1954年8月召开的全国农民业余文化教育会议，虽然基本上纠正了这个偏向，但是后来制定的具体计划却仍偏于保守。因而扫除文盲工作就在很长时期内陷于踏步不前的状态。过去三年在小学教育的发展上也有保守倾向。1955年小学虽然有一定发展，但是发展的比例过小，若和1952年比较，实际上三年中间只增长了4％。在师范教育方面，过去除了在高等师范教育方面有了较快的发展以外，对师范学校的发展是注意得不够的，尤其是近年来不适当的削减了师范学校的招生名额，同时又收缩了初级师范学校，这就增加了今天小学师资不足的困难。这些情况之所以发生，主要是由于过去工作中存在的严重的右倾保守思想所造成的。通过这次全面规划，我们才严格地检查了过去的各项工作，分析和批判了过去的缺点和错误，坚决地克服了各项事业方面的右倾保守思想。这就使我们的领导思想提高了一步。目前除了个别地区还存在着一些消极保守情绪以外，全国广大地区已经出现了迎接文化建设高潮的热潮，这就为发展国民教育事业创设了极其有利的条件。但是最近以来，各地却又产生了程度不同的急躁冒进情绪，在扫除文盲工作方面表现得尤为严重。自从中央提出在五年或者七年内基本上扫除文盲的期限以后，各省、市大都把扫除文盲的期限缩短为四年至五年。很多产业系统规定二年至二年半扫除职工中的文盲。至于基层单位，比省、市要求得还要快一些，以致有些地区和厂矿负责扫盲的干部为了赶任务，就产生了强迫命令的现象。例如有的地方就对群众采取了不参加学习扣工分或处罚的办法；有的地方到处设立“识字岗”、“拦路识字站”强迫群众学习。这些错误的作法，对于生产，对于群众健康，对于扫盲工作的开展，都是有害的。
    造成这种情况的原因当然很多，但是它和教育部领导本身的头脑有些发热是有关联的。例如，我们和高等教育部、全国总工会在1955年12月召开的全国职工业余教育工作会议上，就曾提出要在今后两、三年内扫除现有职工中的文盲（后来中共中央和国务院“关于扫除文盲的决定”中才定为三年或五年），这就明显地现露出了我们的急躁情绪。在普及小学义务教育方面也同样要求得过急了一些。特别是在今年年初，我们对于发展各项教育事业的劲头很大，要求过急，这就直接助长了各省市教育行政部门的急躁情绪，以致层层加紧完成任务的期限，提出了过急过高的要求。教育部对这个问题是负一定责任的。同时这也是我们需要深刻记取的一个教训。今后我们的一切工作，要像李先念副总理所说的那样“必须放在稳妥可靠的基础上。在反对保守主义的时候，必须同时反对急躁冒进的倾向。”因为“急躁冒进的结果并不能帮助社会主义事业的发展，而只能招致损失。”
      为此，我在这里特别指出：目前一般地区和厂矿企业的扫除文盲工作，应当根据具体情况，分期分批地进行；对扫除文盲工作的期限，不宜要求太短太急。对职工扫盲的期限，应当根据各地区和各产业的具体条件来确定。原来规定的期限太短太紧的可以适当延长。农民和城市居民的扫盲期限，如果有规定得太短太紧的，也可以适当延长。同时，必须坚持自愿学习的原则，迅速克服强迫命令的现象，使扫盲工作顺利健康地发展起来。
      同样，国民教育事业的其他各项事业
  中如果有要求过急过高的，也要按照这一个精神改正，应该注意按照各地具体情况，
  分期分批分地区逐步实现事业计划。
      各位代表！我们在国民教育工作上虽
  然取得了一定的成绩，但是，正如刚才我
  所讲过的，却还存在着许多缺点和问题。
  希望各位代表和全国人民经常给我们提出
  批评和意见，督促和帮助我们克服缺点和
  解决困难，使我们能够顺利地完成国家和
  人民交给我们的光荣任务。
