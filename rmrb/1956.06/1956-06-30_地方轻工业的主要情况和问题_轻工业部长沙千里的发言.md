Now I would like to express some opinions on the main situation and problems of local light industry:
	(1)	Local light industry accounts for a large proportion of the total output value of light industry in our country, about 76%. It is very closely related to people's lives. In terms of food: edible vegetable oil, wine, flour, etc. are basically supplied by local industry; in terms of clothing, local industry produces 33% of the country's cotton yarn, 54% of cotton cloth, and 68% of printed and dyed cloth. As for matches, enamel products, ceramics, thermos bottles, aluminum products, toothpaste, soap, leather products, and many cultural and educational supplies, almost all are produced by local industry.
	In the past few years, local light industry has developed greatly. From 1951 to 1955, the state invested 1,580 million yuan in basic construction of local state-owned and local joint state-private industrial enterprises under the industrial departments of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, of which about 850 million yuan was related to light industry. The newly added production capacity due to the completion of these basic construction units includes: 3.2 million pairs of rubber shoes, 55,000 tons of paper, 4.69 million enamel basins, 60.92 million thermos bottles, 460,000 cotton spindles, 5.487 million bolts of cotton cloth, 6.22 million bolts of printed and dyed cloth, 236,000 tons of sugar, 294,000 tons of flour, 94,000 tons of wine, and 59,000 tons of vegetable oil. In 1956, there were 24 planned projects for basic construction, new construction, and reconstruction above the quota limit. There are 257 Category C projects and even more Category D projects. Of the above 281 projects, 142 belong to the food industry, 65 to textiles, and 74 to light industry. The investment in Category C and above basic construction projects this year is 237.6 million yuan, an increase of more than 50% over last year. The increase in the inland areas is even greater. For example, Shaanxi and Jiangxi each increased by more than two times, Hunan increased by more than four times, Shanxi increased by more than seven times. Qinghai and Gansu did not have any light industry Category C or above basic construction projects last year, but this year they will each invest 2 to 3 million yuan. In terms of the output value and output of local light industry, the development has also been rapid in the past few years. Compared with the actual completion number in 1952, the planned output of several major products in 1956 is 1.9 times for rubber shoes, 1.32 times for matches, 1.31 times for cotton cloth, 1.46 times for machine-made paper, 1.25 times for cigarettes, 1.7 times for edible vegetable oil, and 2.66 times for sugar. Other products have also increased to varying degrees.
	In the past few years, the cost of local industry has been continuously reduced. Compared with the previous year, it decreased by 6.25% in 1953, 8.8% in 1954, and is expected to decrease by 8.5% in 1955. The cumulative cost reduction from 1952 to 1955 was 22.3%. Although the improvement of product quality has been slow, it has also improved somewhat. The variety of products has increased a lot. These situations show that, due to the central government's emphasis and the active and creative role of local governments, local light industry has achieved corresponding growth under the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and the speed of development is quite rapid. It has played a certain role in meeting the daily needs of the vast urban and rural people and accumulating funds for national industrialization.
	At the beginning of this year, following the high tide of agricultural cooperation, private industries across the country, with nearly 90,000 households, implemented joint state-private ownership across the board. The vast number of workers in local state-owned and joint state-private industrial enterprises are enthusiastic about building socialism. An unprecedented production upsurge has also appeared in local light industry. In addition, the agricultural harvest last year has ensured the completion of the 1956 plan, thereby enabling local light industry to complete the first five-year plan three quarters or one year ahead of schedule. The indicators of reducing costs and improving labor productivity in local state-owned light industry will also be completed about one year ahead of schedule.
	(2)	Like other departments, local light industry has achieved great achievements in the past few years. However, there are many problems, some of which are very serious. Generally, there are shortcomings of low quality and high cost. As pointed out by Director Jia Tuofu of the Fourth Office of the State Council and other representatives, the situation of poor product quality is very serious. The poor quality and decline of certain products have, on the one hand, caused dissatisfaction and blame from the vast number of consumers, and on the other hand, caused significant waste and loss of social wealth. This must be continuously strived to be quickly corrected. I fully agree with the improvement suggestions put forward by Director Jia.
	Last year, the work of the local industry department focused on arranging production because the production of many industries in private industry encountered difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party and the State Council, many professional meetings were held continuously, and measures such as assigning tasks to local state-owned industries, taking care of backward factories, changing product varieties, adjusting wages, and combining arrangements with reorganization were adopted, and the problems were quickly resolved. Subsequently, the focus was shifted to the technical aspects, and methods such as formulating quality standards, operating points, summarizing and promoting advanced experience, and conducting product testing and inspection were adopted to improve product quality. However, because there are many industries in local light industry, the types of products are complex, and the production technology of various products has its own characteristics, and our experience is not enough, we have not been able to grasp more. We have only done some work on matches, rubber shoes, pencils, gold pens, fountain pens, toothpaste, toothbrushes, thermos bottles, enamel, oil, wine, canned food and other products. It should be said that we have not done enough in strengthening technical leadership over local light industry and helping to solve product quality problems in local light industry. Due to the fact that many enterprises simply pursue output value and output, and unilaterally save raw materials, the phenomenon of declining product quality has occurred. The situation in the third quarter of last year was even more serious. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued instructions to quickly correct this situation. In the past six months, the local industry department, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions, has conducted a comprehensive inspection of the local industrial system, convened professional meetings by industry and product, and adopted various specific measures to vigorously reverse the situation. At present, many improvements have been made, but the quality of some products is still unstable, and the quality of some products is even declining. We must continue to work hard to solve them.
	We believe that solving the problem of product quality requires a lot of work, and the main key lies in the improvement of technology. At present, in various industries of local light industry, there are still some enterprises whose product quality is relatively good and relatively high, and compared with the backward factories in the same industry, the difference between high and low, good and bad is generally very large. For example, the breaking force of No. 8 grass cardboard produced in Tianjin reaches 6.4 kilograms, which is not only the leader among local paper mills, but also has a higher quality than the cardboard produced by state-owned factories. When I inspected Jiangsu Province this time, I saw that the thermos bottle liners produced by the Nanjing Glass Factory, after taking technical measures, can withstand sudden changes in performance from 160 degrees Celsius to 20 degrees Celsius without exploding or cracking, and the vertical pressure resistance also reaches 50 kilograms. However, the products of some enterprises that have not been improved are still far behind these products. This situation exists in many products. Since the quality of the same industry and the same product varies from high to low, good to bad, and the difference is very large, then we have the conditions to improve the backward situation with good and advanced experience. Therefore, at present, if we want to improve technology and solve quality problems, in addition to actively carrying out scientific research and striving to learn advanced technology from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, we must make full use of our favorable conditions to deeply summarize and vigorously promote our existing advanced experience.
	Because there are many industries in local light industry, the enterprises in each industry vary in size and equipment. The enterprises have commonalities and differences. In the process of promoting advanced experience, the situation that it cannot be promoted and implemented often occurs; not only the experience created by large factories, but small factories and backward factories believe that the conditions are not enough to learn; the experience created by small factories, but large factories believe that it is not suitable for the situation and cannot be promoted, and because there are many enterprises, the operating methods between enterprises, and even between two or three shifts within an enterprise are inconsistent, "one master, one method". Therefore, many enterprises often emphasize "adapting to local conditions" and believe that the experience of foreign factories is not applicable in their own factories. Old masters and technicians also have different opinions on new things, which affects the promotion of advanced experience. So, how can we systematically and effectively promote advanced experience? We believe that summarizing advanced experience in a deep and meticulous manner according to products, after scientific appraisal, formulating quality standards, process regulations, and inspection systems for promotion will achieve significant results. Practice has also proved that where such summary and promotion have been carried out, not only have technicians been used reasonably and their enthusiasm and creativity have been brought into play, but also technical problems that could not be solved in the past have been solved. Product quality has also been significantly improved. The shortcomings in our past work lie in not grasping this key point well and vigorously summarizing and promoting it.
	When summarizing and promoting advanced experience, first of all, we must concentrate the technicians and experienced technicians from the advanced factories in the same industry, go deep into the typical factories for pilot projects, summarize the production technology experience of the entire industry according to the products, exchange the various different experiences of each factory, and discuss the various different theoretical understandings, analyze and compare the various different practices through on-site experiments, and raise them to the theoretical level, then, in combination with social needs, stipulate different levels of product quality standards such as advanced, intermediate, and low-level that are suitable for people's requirements, and based on the product quality standards, concentrate all the successful experiences in operation, formulate operating procedures or operating points; in combination with different equipment and different raw material conditions, study and propose the measures that each enterprise should take in terms of technical equipment, raw material supply, inspection, testing and formulation. At the same time, specifically point out measures to reduce raw material consumption and reduce costs. In this way, not only can the problems be dealt with more deeply and thoroughly, but also because many enterprise cadres and technicians have directly participated in the pilot work, their ideological understanding is basically consistent, and their actual operation is also more familiar. After these comrades return to the factory, they will become the backbone of the promotion work. Because the pilot factories generally improve faster in technology through pilot projects. For industries with many enterprises, other enterprises can also be organized to study in the pilot factories; or technicians and technicians in the pilot work can be organized to provide technical assistance to other enterprises to help them improve their work; or training courses can be organized to conduct technical training for the employees of other enterprises so that more technicians can master advanced experience and return to the factory to promote it, so as to expand the scope of promotion. In this way, it is possible for all enterprises in the various industries of the decentralized, backward, and numerous local light industry to generally take a big step forward in technology in a relatively short period of time, or they can reach the advanced level.
	We believe that with the above standards, procedures and measures, the ideological work and organizational leadership work of enterprises can also have specific and richer content. Enterprise leaders will no longer be generally calling for improving quality, but will have a clear goal to instruct the masses and give enterprise leaders an important weapon to guide production. At the same time, the widespread and in-depth implementation of these standards and regulations can further overcome the past situation of local light industry's work being one-sided and taking care of one thing and losing sight of another, that is, ignoring quality when increasing output, reducing quality when saving raw materials, and even cheating in order to pursue quantity. In this way, not only will the quality be improved, but also conditions will be created for product costs, labor productivity, yield, and raw material consumption quotas to reach advanced levels.
	In addition, in order to strengthen the implementation of standards, regulations, and the promotion of advanced experience, so as to improve product quality and enterprise management level, organizing inter-factory competitions in the same industry is a very good way. Through this form of competition, not only will the internal competition of the factory be further consolidated and improved, but also the ties between the factories in the same industry will be strengthened, and the factories will promote mutual learning, organize mutual inspections and observations. Insiders who inspect insiders can easily find problems, find out the reasons, and propose solutions, so that the problems can be solved more quickly, and outsiders can also be taught. Therefore, it is also an effective way to carry out criticism and self-criticism between enterprises, correct the conservative thinking and complacency of some enterprises, and promote the common progress of all enterprises in the industry.
	(3)	Although the relationship between local industry and commerce has improved in the past few years, there are still many problems, especially at the grassroots enterprise level, there are many disputes. Since the beginning of this year, due to the rapid development of the socialist revolution situation, the production upsurge of local industry has risen, and some problems in the relationship between industry and commerce have become more prominent. This is primarily the responsibility of our industrial departments, that is, some enterprises do not have a clear enough idea of being responsible to consumers, and there is a supply system mentality, thinking that as long as the products can be delivered to the factory, they will be processed, ordered, and sold by the commercial departments. Many products are of low quality and high cost, and cannot meet the needs of the people, thus causing difficulties in the work of the commercial departments; but on the other hand, some aspects of commercial work have also affected the enthusiasm of industrial development and production, improving quality, and reducing costs, for example, commercial departments submit plans late, change quickly, change a lot, and the wages and prices are too high or too low; in the inspection of finished products, because the standards of industry and commerce are inconsistent and the inspection methods are not unified, it is often different depending on the person and depending on the peak and off-season of the market; in the promotion of finished products, new products from factories or products with improved quality cannot meet the market in time. Of course, we should also look at it objectively. It is not without difficulties for commercial departments to grasp the extremely complex nature of the work of grasping people's needs and market changes. Commercial departments are also difficult to take the initiative in this regard, and often have to change with market changes. The question is how to make industrial and commercial departments work more closely together to gradually improve this work. In April of this year, we and the Ministry of Commerce reached an agreement on several issues concerning the connection between industrial and commercial plans and the implementation of economic contracts. Seriously implementing this agreement will play a certain positive role in improving the relationship between industry and commerce. Recently, under the leadership of the State Council, further consultations have been conducted based on the feedback from various regions and the commercial departments. We believe that the solution should also come from the joint efforts of both industry and commerce. The industrial departments should first ensure product quality and guarantee refunds and exchanges, while the commercial departments should ensure that the purchasing plan remains unchanged for one year to ensure the normal production of industry. The industrial departments should quickly formulate unified quality standards as the basis for acceptance. The commercial departments should strive to achieve both "pushing out the old" and "bringing forth the new" in the promotion of finished products, so that new and good products can meet consumers in time. As for the submitted prices, further research is needed due to the complex factors involved. According to my personal experience during this inspection in Nanjing and other places, the problems in the relationship between industry and commerce are very complex and have a wide impact. A thorough solution should be sought quickly, and this requires both industry and commerce to actively strive to break the routine based on the laws of objective development and start from the status quo, and study some fundamental solutions. For example, we can consider organizing some factories and stores to establish fixed buying and selling relationships under unified balance plans based on the natural laws of commodity circulation and the original supply and marketing relationships. This can reduce circulation links, enable factories to understand the needs of consumers in a timely manner, and strengthen their sense of responsibility. It is also convenient for stores to urge factories to improve varieties and improve quality. Although this is just my personal idea, I believe that as long as industry and commerce cooperate closely, many more practical methods than what I said can be created to solve the problems that have not yet been solved. If these methods are effective after trial implementation, they can be promoted at any time, so that the problems will not accumulate for a long time, and conditions can be created for the rapid solution of related problems.
	(4)	The 40th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the resolution on adjusting the organizational structure of the State Council. Now, the Ministry of Local Industry has ended, and all work has been managed by the relevant specialized industrial departments, which will greatly promote the solution of problems existing in local industry. We also hope that the various ministries can seize the solution and make up for the shortcomings of the work of the Ministry of Local Industry. We must actively strive to solve the problems related to papermaking and daily necessities industries.
	The State Council is currently holding a system conference to study the issue of the national system. It is believed that the correct solution of the system issue will promote the rapid development of local industry, fully and rationally utilize local resources, and accumulate more funds, thereby more favorably ensuring national key construction and opening up a new situation. We have learned that under this new situation, the central industrial ministries will definitely strengthen their leadership over local industry. In accordance with the principle of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, we will strengthen the leadership of unified planning and planning, and give play to the guiding role of planning, so as to give play to enthusiasm and avoid blindness. At the same time, we will strengthen technical guidance and assistance to local industry, so that new technical forces in local industry will continue to grow, so as to better and more comprehensively complete the tasks assigned by the state.
	There were many mistakes and shortcomings in the work of the Ministry of Local Industry for more than a year. Please criticize and correct us.

    地方轻工业的主要情况和问题
    ——轻工业部长沙千里的发言
    现在我就地方轻工业的主要情况和问题，发表一些意见：
    （一）地方轻工业在我国整个轻工业产值中占的比重很大，约达76％。它和人民生活关系十分密切。在食品方面：食用植物油、酒、面粉等基本上由地方工业供应；穿着方面的棉纱，地方工业生产的占全国的33％，棉布占54％，印染布占68％。至于像火柴、搪瓷品、陶瓷品、热水瓶、铝制品、牙膏、肥皂、皮革制品以及许多文教用品，几乎全部是地方工业生产来供应的。
    几年来地方轻工业有很大的发展，从1951年到1955年，国家投资于各省、市、自治区工业厅局系统地方国营和地方公私合营工业进行基本建设的资金达158，000万元，其中有关轻工业的约85，000万元。由于这些基本建设单位的完成而新增加的生产能力有：胶鞋320万双，纸5.5万吨，搪瓷面盆469万个，热水瓶6，092万个，棉纺锭46万枚，棉布548.7万匹，印染布622万匹，糖23.6万吨，面粉29.4万吨，酒9.4万吨，植物油5.9万吨。1956年基本建设新建、改建的计划项目，限额以上的有24个。丙类项目有257个，丁类的数目更多。在上述281个项目中，属于食品方面的有142个；纺织65个，轻工业74个。今年丙类以上基本建设项目的投资额为23，760万元，比去年增长50％以上，其中内地增长更大，如陕西、江西各增加两倍多，湖南增加4倍多，山西增加7倍多，青海、甘肃去年没有轻工业丙类以上的基建项目，今年则各投资二、三百万元。从地方轻工业的产值、产量来说，几年来发展也是很快的，以1956年几种主要产品的计划产量和1952年实际完成数相比，胶鞋为1.9倍，火柴1.32倍，棉布1.31倍，机制纸1.46倍，卷烟1.25倍，食用植物油1.7倍，糖2.66倍，其他产品也都有不同程度的增长。
    几年来地方工业的成本不断降低，与上一年比较，1953年降低6.25％，1954年降低8.8％， 1955年降低预计为8.5％。从1952年到1955年累计降低成本22.3％，产品质量虽然改进较缓，但也有所改进。产品品种增加不少。这些情况说明：由于中央的重视和地方的积极性创造性的发挥，在优先发展重工业的前提下，地方轻工业有了相应的增长，而且发展的速度还是相当迅速的，对于满足城乡广大人民的日常生活需要，对于积累国家工业化资金，都起到了一定的作用。
    今年年初继农业合作化的高潮之后，全国近9万户的私营工业全行业实行了公私合营。地方国营和公私合营工业广大职工建设社会主义情绪热烈，在地方轻工业中也出现了前所未有的生产高潮，加上去年农业丰收，这就保证了1956年计划的完成，从而使地方轻工业有可能提前三个季度或一年完成第一个五年计划。地方国营轻工业的降低成本及提高劳动生产率的指标也将提前一年左右完成。
    （二）地方轻工业几年来也和其他部门一样取得了很大的成就。但问题很多，有的还很严重。一般地存在着质量低、成本高的缺点。关于产品质量低劣的情况正如国务院第四办公室贾拓夫主任和其他几位代表所指出的那样，是十分严重的。某些产品的质量不好和下降，一方面引起了广大消费群众的不满和责备，另一方面也造成了社会财富的重大浪费和损失。这是必须继续努力迅速纠正的。贾主任提出的改进意见，我十分同意。
    去年，地方工业部的工作，由于私营工业许多行业的生产发生困难，因此重点放在安排生产方面，在党和国务院的领导下曾经连续召开了许多专业会议，采取了地方国营工业让任务，照顾落后厂，改变产品品种，调整工缴和安排与改组相结合等措施，问题得到迅速解决。随后就把重点转到技术方面，采取制定质量标准，操作要点，总结与推广先进经验，进行产品化验、检验等办法，来提高产品质量，但因地方轻工业行业多，产品种类复杂，而且各种产品的生产技术又各有不同特点，我们的经验也不够，没有能够更多的抓，只对火柴、胶鞋、铅笔、金笔、钢笔、牙膏、牙刷、热水瓶、搪瓷、油、酒、罐头等产品作了些工作，应该说我们在加强对地方轻工业的技术领导，帮助解决地方轻工业产品质量上的问题做得很不够。由于很多企业单纯追求产值产量，片面节约原材料，产生了产品质量下降的现象，去年第三季度的情况更为严重，中共中央和国务院为此发出指示，要求迅速纠正这种情况。半年多来地方工业部根据指示精神，通过地方工业系统的全面检查，按行业和产品召开专业会议，并采取各项具体措施，大力扭转，目前已经得到了不少改进，但有些产品质量仍旧不稳定，有些产品甚至还有下降趋势，还必须继续努力解决。
    我们认为解决产品质量问题，要做不少工作，而主要关键则在于技术的提高。目前地方轻工业的各个行业中，都还有一些企业的产品质量是比较好，比较高的，而且和同行业的落后厂比较起来高低、好次一般相差悬殊，例如天津生产的8号草板纸的突破力达到6.4公斤，不仅是地方纸厂中的先进者，而且比国营厂的板纸质量还高。我这次到江苏省视察，看到南京玻璃厂的热水瓶胆，采取技术措施后，经过急变性能的试验，从摄氏160度骤降到摄氏20度，可以不炸不裂，直立耐压力也达到50公斤。但是有些企业尚未改进的产品，和这些产品比较起来，依然相差很远。这种情况在很多产品中都存在着，既然同一行业同一产品的质量有高有低，有好有坏，而且相差悬殊，那末我们就有条件以好的先进的经验来改进落后的状况。因此，目前我们要提高技术，解决质量问题，除积极进行科学研究工作并努力学习苏联和人民民主国家的先进技术外，就必须充分利用我们的有利条件，深入地总结和有力地推广我们已经有的先进经验。
    由于地方轻工业行业多，每个行业中企业大小不一，设备参差不齐，各企业有共同之处，也有不同之处。在推广先进经验当中，常常会发生推不广、贯彻不下去的情况；不仅是大厂创造出来的经验，小厂、落后厂认为条件不够不能学；小厂创造出来的经验，大厂又认为不适合情况推不动，并且由于企业多，企业与企业之间，甚至一个企业内二班、三班的操作方法也不一致，“一个师傅一个样”。因此，许多企业也常常强调“因地制宜”，认为外厂经验在本厂不适用。老师傅、技术人员对新事物也各有见解，从而影响了先进经验的推广。那么，怎样才能系统地有效地推广先进经验呢？我们认为按产品深入而细致地总结先进经验，经过科学的鉴定，制订质量标准，工艺规程，检验制度加以推广，是会收到显著成效的。实践也已证明：凡是经过这样总结和推广的，既合理使用了技术人员，发挥了他们的积极性和创造性，同时也解决了过去不能解决的技术问题。产品质量也获得了显著改进。我们过去工作中的缺点也就在于没有很好地抓住这个要害，有力地去总结和推广。
    在总结和推广先进经验的时候，首先要集中同行业中各先进厂的技术人员、有经验的技工，深入到典型厂进行试点，按产品总结全行业的生产技术经验，交流各厂的各种不同的经验，对各种不同的理论认识展开讨论，把各种不同的作法一一经过实地试验加以分析比较，提高到理论水平，然后结合社会需要，规定出适合于人民要求的高级、中级、低级等不同等级的产品质量标准，并根据产品质量标准，集中操作上一切成功经验，制定操作规程或操作要点；结合不同设备、不同原料情况加以研究，提出各企业在技术设备上，原料供应、检验、化验以及配方上应该采取的措施。同时，具体指出降低原材料消耗、降低成本的措施。这样，不仅可以把问题搞得比较深、比较透；而且由于有很多企业的干部和技工直接参加了试点工作，思想认识基本取得一致，实际操作也较熟悉。这些同志回厂后，就成为推广工作的骨干，由于试点厂通过试点，一般在技术上提高得较快。企业多的行业还可以组织其他企业的职工到试点厂学习；或者组织试点工作中的技术人员和技工到其他企业进行技术援助，帮助他们提高工作；或者组织训练班对其他企业的职工进行技术训练，使更多的技工能够掌握先进经验，回厂推广，以扩大推广的面。这样，就有可能使分散、落后、为数众多的地方轻工业的各个行业所有的企业，经过一个较短的时期，普遍地在技术上前进一大步，或者就可以达到先进的水平。
    我们认为有了上述的标准、规程和措施，还可以使企业的思想工作和组织领导工作有了具体的更加丰富的内容。企业领导将可以不再是一般的号召提高质量，而是有一个明确的目标向群众指示出来，给企业领导者一个指导生产的重要武器。同时，广泛深入的贯彻这些标准规程，就可以进一步克服地方轻工业过去工作上单打一顾此失彼的情形，即提高产量就忽视质量，节约原材料就降低质量，甚至为了追求数量就弄虚作假的偏向。这样不单在质量上会有所提高，也为产品成本、劳动生产率、出品率以及原材料消耗定额等达到先进水平创造了条件。
    此外，为了加强贯彻标准、规程和推广先进经验工作，以提高产品质量和企业管理水平，组织同行业厂际竞赛是一个很好的办法。通过这种形式的竞赛不但会使厂内竞赛进一步巩固和提高；并且密切了同行业各厂间的联系，促进各厂间互相学习，组织互相检查、观摩，内行检查内行容易发现问题，找出原因，提出解决办法，使问题较快地得到解决，同时也可以教会外行。因而，它也是一个开展企业间的批评与自我批评，纠正某些企业保守思想和骄傲自满情绪，推动全行企业共同前进的一个有效方法。
    （三）地方工业与商业之间的关系，这几年来虽然有所改进，但存在问题不少，特别是在基层企业单位争执很多，今年以来，由于社会主义革命形势的迅速发展，地方工业的生产高潮起来后，工商关系上的某些问题又显得比较突出。这首先在我们工业部门负有一定的责任，这就是有些企业对消费者负责的思想不够明确，存在着供给制思想，认为反正产品由商业部门加工订货包销，只要能出厂就行，不少产品质量低，成本高，不能适合人民的需要，因而造成商业部门工作上的困难；但在另一方面，商业工作的某些方面，也影响了工业发展生产、提高质量、降低成本的积极性，例如商业部门计划提得晚，变得快、变得多、工缴货价偏高偏低；在成品检验上，由于工商标准不一，检验方法不统一，往往是因人而不同，因市场淡旺而不同；在成品推销上，工厂的新产品或改进质量后的产品不能及时与市场见面等。当然，我们也应客观地来看，商业部门在掌握人民需要和市场变化这样一种极端复杂性质的工作，不是没有困难的，商业部门在这方面也难于主动，往往要随着市场的变化而变化，问题是如何使工业与商业部门更好的密切协作，来逐步改进这一方面的工作。今年四月我们曾和商业部对有关工商计划衔接、贯彻经济合同中的若干问题达成了协议，认真贯彻这一协议，对改善工商关系将起一定的积极作用。最近在国务院领导下，又根据各地的反映和商业部门作进一步的磋商。我们认为解决的办法还应该从工商双方来共同努力，工业部门首先应该保证产品质量，做到包退包换，而商业部门则应做到进货计划一年不变，以保证工业的正常生产。工业部门应该迅速制订统一的质量标准，作为验收的根据，商业部门在成品推销上力求做到既能“推陈”又能“出新”，使新产品、好产品能够及时与消费者见面，至于上缴货价则由于因素复杂需要进一步研究。据我个人这次到南京等地视察的体会，工商关系上的问题十分复杂，影响面很广，应该迅速求得彻底的解决，而这就必须工商双方积极努力根据客观发展规律，从现状出发打破常规，研究一些从根本上解决问题的办法，例如可以考虑根据商品流转的自然规律和原来的供销关系，在统一平衡计划下，有领导地组织某些工厂和商店建立固定的买卖关系，这样既可以减少流转环节，使工厂能够及时了解到消费者的需要，加强他们的责任心，也便于商店督促工厂改进花色品种，提高质量。这虽然只是我个人的一种想法，但相信只要工商双方密切配合，是可以创造出许多比我所说更要切合实际的办法来解决目前尚未解决的问题，这些办法如果试行有效，随时加以推广，这样，就不致使问题长期堆积，而能为迅速地解决有关问题创造条件。
    （四）全国人民代表大会常务委员会第四十次会议通过了关于调整国务院所属组织机构的决议，现在，地方工业部已经结束，所有工作已经由各有关专业工业部分工管理，这将会大大促进地方工业中存在的问题的解决，我们也希望各部能够抓紧解决，弥补地方工业部工作的缺陷，有关造纸和日用品工业方面的问题，我们更要积极地努力去解决。
    最近国务院正在召开体制会议，研究国家体制问题。相信由于体制问题的正确解决，将会促进地方工业迅速发展。充分地、合理地利用地方资源，更多地积累资金，因而更有利地保证国家重点建设，展开一个新的局面。我们体会到在这种新的情况下，中央各工业部对地方工业一定会加强领导。按照国民经济有计划按比例发展的原则，加强统一的规划与计划的领导，发挥计划的指导作用，以发挥积极性，避免盲目性。同时，加强对地方工业的技术指导和援助，使地方工业中新的技术力量不断生长，从而能更好地、更全面地完成国家给予的任务。
    地方工业部一年多的工作中，存在着不少错误和缺点，请各位代表批评指正。
