    Caused by Registration
    Wang Qing
    Recently, I heard a comrade from the Civil Affairs Department of Shanxi Province mention the following incident that occurred in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, not long ago: One day, Deputy County Head Wang of this county went to the hospital to see a doctor. Without going through the registration process, he strode straight in. Guo Dequan, a demobilized soldier in charge of registration, did not recognize who the person was. He fulfilled his duty and raised his concerns, which greatly angered Deputy County Head Wang. As a result, shortly after the incident, Guo Dequan was fired.
    A person who violates the rules can use his position and power to prevent the person who upholds the rules from continuing to work. Here, principle and justice are turned upside down!
    Anyone can see that Deputy County Head Wang has a sense of privilege. The so-called sense of privilege is the belief that one has power and rights that surpass those of ordinary people. In the eyes of such people, all laws, decrees, policies, principles, and systems are meant to be followed by others, while they themselves can be unrestrained. This is, of course, an absurd idea. However, this idea has become an unshakable conviction in some people. They have lived this way for a long time, without being strictly criticized. They have become accustomed to it, have developed illusions, and believe that the revolutionary ranks are naturally divided into two types of people: those with privileges and those without, and that they naturally belong to the former.
    In our country, there are no privileges. No matter how important a position one holds, one can only exercise the powers entrusted to him by the people and strive to serve the people. In our country, everyone has the obligation to abide by public order. No matter who it is, in the face of public order, they only have the responsibility to maintain it, to abide by it in an exemplary manner, and have no right to破坏 it.
    The hospital registration system is an indispensable system for any hospital. All patients should register. Since Deputy County Head Wang was there to see a doctor, he should have registered. But he didn't, he disrupted this order, and he struck at the person who helped him abide by the order. No wonder everyone who hears about this is indignant.
    Deputy County Head Wang's behavior shows that he demands that his subordinates treat him with utmost respect and obedience. He does not influence his subordinates with revolutionary virtue or contributions to the people, but relies on the position he holds. If he is right, they must cheer for him; if he is wrong, they must also cheer for him! Normal criticism and self-criticism, normal principles and systems, are all rendered useless in his presence.
    In our revolutionary ranks, there are certainly not many who have the kind of thinking and style of Deputy County Head Wang, but he is not the only one. Because of this, as a citizen, I hope to hear the outcome of this matter. Because Guo Dequan was fired in that way, I also want to understand: Why was the order to fire Guo Dequan executed so smoothly?

    由挂号引起的
    王青
    最近听到山西省民政厅的一位同志谈起，不久以前，山西省的解虞县发生了这样一件事情：一天，这个县的王副县长到卫生院看病，没有办理挂号手续，就昂然直入。担任挂号工作的复员建设军人郭德全不认识来人是谁，他履行自己的职责，提出了意见，这却大大触怒了王副县长。结果，就在事情发生以后不久，郭德全被开除了。
    违背制度的人，竟能够利用职务和权力，使坚持制度的人不能继续工作下去；在这里，原则和公道都反转过来了！
    谁也可以看出，王副县长有一种特权思想。所谓特权思想，就是自以为自己有着超乎一般人的权力和权利。在这种人看来，一切法律、法令、政策、原则和制度等等，都是要旁人遵守的，而他本人却可以不受约束。这当然是荒唐的想法。可是这种想法在某些人身上几乎成了不可动摇的信念。长期以来他们是这样生活过来的，没有受到严格的批评。他们习惯了，发生错觉了，以为革命队伍里天然就分成有特权的和没有特权的两种人，而他自然属于前者。
    在我们国家，特权是没有的。无论担任多么重要的职务，也只能行使人民赋予他的职权，努力为人民服务。在我们的国家，每一个人都有遵守公共秩序的义务。无论是谁，在公共秩序面前，只有责任去维护它，模范地遵守它，而没有权利去破坏它。
    医院的挂号制度，是任何一个医院不可缺少的制度；凡是病人，都应该挂号；王副县长既然是来看病，就当然应该挂号。可是他没有这样做，他破坏了这种秩序，并且打击了帮助他遵守秩序的人。这就无怪乎所有听到这件事情的人，都气愤不平了。
    王副县长用自己的行为表明，他是要求他的下属对他的一切都要毕恭毕敬、唯命是从的。他不是用革命品德、用对人民的贡献来影响下属，而是仗恃着他所担任的职务。他对了，要向他欢呼；他错了，也要向他欢呼！正常的批评和自我批评，正常的原则和制度，在他那里都失去了作用。
    在我们革命队伍里，具有王副县长那种思想和作风的，当然不是大量的，可是也并不是唯一的。正因为这样，作为一个公民，我希望听到对这件事情的处理结果。因为郭德全被那样地开除了，因此我也希望了解：开除郭德全的命令，为甚么会顺利地被执行了？
