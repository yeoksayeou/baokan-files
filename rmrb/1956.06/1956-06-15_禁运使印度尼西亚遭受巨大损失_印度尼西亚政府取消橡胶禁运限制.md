Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 14th: The Indonesian Ministry of Information said on June 13th that the Indonesian government has decided that rubber exports will no longer be subject to embargo restrictions.

	In a broadcast statement, the Ministry of Information said that the embargo policy has caused huge losses to Indonesia, and the situation of small producers is particularly difficult. The longer the embargo is maintained, the greater the damage it will bring.

	The broadcast statement pointed out that the international situation has become increasingly relaxed, and many countries are working to restore normal international relations, which are needed by the people of the world. In order to help restore normal international trade relations and to protect the interests of Indonesia and rubber producers, the country no longer has any reason to restrict rubber exports.

	The statement also traced back to when the United Nations passed the embargo policy, Indonesia stated that it reserved the right to amend the embargo list. Now is the time for the Indonesian government to reconsider this policy to protect its own economic interests.

    禁运使印度尼西亚遭受巨大损失
    印度尼西亚政府取消橡胶禁运限制
    新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚情报部在六月十三日说，印度尼西亚政府已经决定在橡胶输出方面不再受禁运政策的限制。
    情报部在一篇广播声明中说，禁运政策使印度尼西亚遭受了极大的损失，小生产者的处境尤其困难。禁运维持越久，它所带来的损害就越重。
    这篇广播声明指出，国际局势已经日趋缓和，许多国家正在致力于恢复正常的国际关系，这种正常关系是世界人民所需要的。为了帮助恢复国际的正常贸易关系，为了保护印度尼西亚国家和橡胶生产者的利益，这个国家再没有理由限制橡胶出口了。
    声明还追溯说，当联合国通过禁运政策的时候，印度尼西亚曾经声明它保留修改禁运货单的权利。现在是印度尼西亚政府重新考虑这一政策以保护自己的经济利益的时候了。
