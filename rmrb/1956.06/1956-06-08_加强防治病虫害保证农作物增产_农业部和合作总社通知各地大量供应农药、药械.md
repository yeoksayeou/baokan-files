Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The Ministry of Agriculture and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives jointly issued a notice on strengthening the current work of preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests.

The notice stated that this year's plant diseases and insect pests are more serious in some areas than last year. In addition, the abnormal climate this spring has caused some plant diseases and insect pests to occur later, earlier, or unevenly, which has brought certain difficulties to the prevention and control work. At the same time, due to the development of cooperativization, many crop cultivation systems and management techniques have undergone new changes. Therefore, we must fully grasp the situation of the occurrence of plant diseases and insect pests this year, raise vigilance, and prevent and control them in a timely manner.

The notice stated that this year's locusts are hatching seven to ten days later, and the peak period of cotton aphid spread is also delayed. Therefore, the favorable time for prevention and control coincides with the wheat harvest. Both tasks are very time-sensitive. Agricultural departments at all levels should assist agricultural production cooperatives in rationally arranging labor so that pest control and wheat harvesting are closely integrated and neither is delayed. Rice blast and cotton seedling diseases are developing rapidly. Agricultural departments must organize technical forces to go deep into the affected areas, find out the disease situation, and take various effective prevention and control measures to carry out rescue. Areas where diseases have not occurred should actively prevent them, and in particular, pay attention to summarizing the masses' experience in prevention and rescue to improve the effectiveness of prevention and control.

The notice stated that agricultural departments at all levels should assist supply and marketing cooperatives in checking the supply of medicines and machinery to ensure that pesticides and machinery are supplied to areas where pests and diseases occur in a timely manner. Most of the old sprayers of the masses have not been repaired. This situation should be taken seriously by all localities. Attention should also be paid to educating the technicians of agricultural production cooperatives to use pesticides and machinery well, and strictly prevent the occurrence of poisoning and casualties to humans and animals. This year, the toxic pesticide 1905 has been promoted in a wide range of areas and in large quantities, and its use should be strictly in accordance with operating procedures.

The notice also stated that agricultural production cooperatives should reasonably evaluate and record work points for labor in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and prevent the phenomenon of not recording or under-recording work. The principle of equal pay for equal work must be implemented for female members participating in pest control.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Up to now, more than 100,000 tons of various chemical pesticides and more than 900,000 pieces of equipment have been allocated to various provinces, regions, and retailers to farmers. Both of these supply figures are many times higher than in the same period last year.

This year, transportation departments in various localities have provided many conveniences for the transfer and transportation of pesticides and equipment, and reduced freight rates, thus greatly reducing turnaround time and freight costs. At the same time, this year's supply and marketing work of pesticides and equipment in various localities has been carried out with the cooperation and assistance of local Party and government leading organs. This has played a great role in improving supply and marketing operations. This year, the retail work of supply and marketing cooperatives in various localities has also been greatly improved. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Henan and other provinces and regions generally adopt the methods of delivering goods to the countryside and supplying them door-to-door according to the pest forecasts of agricultural departments and the needs of rural areas. This has been enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. When insect pests occurred in Chongming County, Jiangsu Province, the county's supply and marketing cooperative, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, organized a drug sales commando team to go to the countryside separately to actively deliver pesticides to agricultural cooperatives. Because they grasped the time of drug use, the prevention and control effect was very good.

    加强防治病虫害保证农作物增产
    农业部和合作总社通知各地大量供应农药、药械
    新华社7日讯　农业部、中华全国供销合作总社联合发出关于加强当前病虫害防治工作的通知。
    通知说，今年的病虫害发生在某些地区比去年重，加上今春气候不正常，使若干种病虫害发生推迟、提早或发生不整齐，给防治工作带来一定困难。同时，由于合作化的发展，许多农作物栽培制度和管理技术都有了新的改变，所以，对今年病虫害的发生，要充分掌握情况，提高警惕，及时防治。
    通知说，今年的飞蝗迟孵化七到十天，棉蚜扩散为害盛期也推迟，因此，防治的有利时机正和麦收工作碰在一块。两项工作的时间性都很强。各级农业部门应该协助农业生产合作社合理安排劳力，使治虫和麦收密切结合，两不耽误。稻热病、棉苗病害发展很快，农业部门必须组织技术力量，深入发病地区，摸清病情，采取各种有效的防治措施，进行抢救。没有发病的地区应该积极预防，尤其要注意总结群众对预防和抢救的经验，提高防治效果。
    通知说，各级农业部门应该协助供销合作社检查药械供应情况，保证农药械适时供应到病虫发生地区。群众旧有的喷雾器大部分没有修理。这一情况应该引起各地重视。还应该注意教育农业生产合作社的技术员很好地使用农药械，严防发生人畜中毒、伤亡事故。今年毒性农药1905推广的地区广、数量大，尤其应该严格按照操作规程使用。
    通知还说，农业生产合作社对防治病虫害的劳动，应该合理评工记分，防止不记工少记工的现象。对女社员参加治虫，必须贯彻同工同酬的原则。
    据新华社7日讯　到目前为止，全国已经调拨到各省、区和零售到农民手中的各种化学农药已经有十多万吨，药械有九十多万架。这两个供应数字都比去年同期增加许多倍。
    今年各地交通运输部门对农药、药械的调运给予很多方便，降低了运价，因此，大大减少了运转时间和运费。同时，今年各地农药、药械的供销工作，大都是在当地党、政领导机关配合和帮助下进行的。这对改进供销业务起了很大作用。今年各地供销社的零售工作也有很大改进。广东、广西、浙江、河南等省、区的供销合作社，一般都根据农业部门的虫情预报和农村的需要情况，采取送货下乡、上门供应的方法。这获得了广大农民的热情欢迎。江苏省崇明县发生虫害的时候，这个县的供销社在党委统一领导下，组织了卖药突击队，分头下乡，主动将农药送到农业社，由于掌握了用药时间，防治的效果很好。
