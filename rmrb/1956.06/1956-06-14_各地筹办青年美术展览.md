Preparations Underway in Various Regions for Youth Art Exhibitions

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The "National Youth Art Exhibition" will be held in Beijing around National Day. Cultural Bureaus, Federations of Literary and Art Circles, and other relevant art organizations in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have successively formed preparatory committees or offices for the Youth Art Exhibition to organize creation, solicit works, and prepare to hold local youth art exhibitions first, selecting some excellent works to participate in the national exhibition.

    Currently, work in many regions is proceeding smoothly. Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang and other provinces have already held or are in the process of holding provincial exhibitions: The Hunan Provincial Youth Art Exhibition was held in Changsha from May 25th to 31st, exhibiting more than 340 works. During the exhibition, a provincial youth art observation meeting was also held. Works are scheduled to be sent to Wuhan for re-evaluation by mid-June; The Guangxi Provincial Youth Art Exhibition opened in Nanning on June 2nd. The young people participating in the works are quite extensive. In addition to professional art workers, there are also workers, farmers, students, and teachers. In addition to the Han nationality, there are also young people from Yao, Miao, Zhuang and Dong nationalities. Jiangxi Province did not specifically exhibit youth works, but held the "Second Jiangxi Provincial Art Exhibition" in Nanchang starting from May 20th. A selection of works by young art authors in the exhibition will participate in the National Youth Art Exhibition. The Heilongjiang Provincial Youth Art Exhibition opened on June 5th at the Harbin Advanced Industrial Experience Exhibition Hall, exhibiting more than 200 works. In addition, Yunnan Province has received more than 500 works from more than 100 authors, and Yuxi Prefecture has also held a special youth art exhibition. After the exhibition, 75 works were selected. The provincial youth art exhibition is scheduled to be held in Kunming from June 25th; The Shaanxi Provincial Youth Art Exhibition is scheduled to open in Xi'an on June 20th. Young art authors are very enthusiastic and are stepping up their creations for the exhibition. The deadline for submissions was originally set for early May, but was therefore extended to the end of May. Other regions such as the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Tianjin have decided to hold exhibitions in July. Since Xinjiang is far from Beijing and transportation is inconvenient, it is planned to exhibit in Urumqi. After preliminary evaluation, the selected works will be directly transported to Beijing; Tianjin will not be able to evaluate until late June, and will strive to exhibit from "July 1st."

    各地筹办青年美术展览
    本报讯　“全国青年美术作品展览”将于国庆节前后在北京举行。各省、市、自治区的文化局、文联和其他美术团体等有关部门，都已先后组成了青年美展的筹委会或办公室，组织创作，征集作品，准备先在当地举办本地区的青年美展，评选一部分优秀作品参加全国性的展出。
    现在，不少地区的工作进行得很顺利。湖南、广西、江西、黑龙江等省都已经或正在举行全省的展出：湖南省青年美展是五月二十五日至三十一日在长沙举行的，展出作品340多件，展出期间并召开了全省青年美术观摩会议，六月半前就可以把作品送往武汉参加复评；广西省青年美展六月二日起在南宁展出，参加作品的青年相当广泛，除了专业美术工作者以外，还有工人、农民、学生和教师，除了汉族以外，还有瑶、苗、僮和侗族的青年。江西省没有专门展出青年作品，而是从五月二十日起在南昌举行了“江西省第二届美术展览会”。展出的不少青年美术作者的作品中，将选出一部分参加全国青年美展。黑龙江省青年美展六月五日在哈尔滨市工业先进经验展览馆开幕，展出作品二百多件。此外，云南省已收到一百多位作者的五百多件作品，玉溪专区还举行了专区的青年美展，展后选出了作品七十五件，全省的青年美展，预定六月二十五日起在昆明举行；陕西省青年美展，准备六月二十日在西安开幕，青年美术作者热情很高，纷纷为展览会加紧创作，原定五月上旬截止收件，因而延长到五月底。其他新疆维吾尔自治区和天津市等地区的展览都决定在七月举行，新疆因离北京较远，交通又不便，准备在乌鲁木齐市展出，经过初评后，就把选出的作品直接运送北京；天津市要六月下旬才能评选，争取从“七一”起展出。
