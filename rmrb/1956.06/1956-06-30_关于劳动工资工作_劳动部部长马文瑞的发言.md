On Labor and Wage Work
— Speech by Ma Wenrui, Minister of Labor

I would like to express some opinions on labor and wage work.

Our country's workers' wage levels have been increasing year by year, but there are still shortcomings and errors in wage work.

Gradually improving the living standards of the working masses on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity is a fundamental policy of the Party and the government. As pointed out by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Li Fuchun in their reports and speeches to the Congress, the wage levels of our country's workers have been increasing year by year. Taking only the first three years of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the average monetary wage of workers in all sectors nationwide in 1955 increased by 20.2% compared to 1952, and the actual wage increased by 12%. At the same time, with the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, the number of employed people has increased rapidly. In the past three years, more than 1.16 million unemployed people have been resettled nationwide, and the number of new workers nationwide has increased by more than 3.58 million. Due to the increase in average wages and the increase in the number of employed people, the total wage bill of workers nationwide in 1955 increased by 76% compared to 1952. In addition, with stable prices and many other measures taken by the government in terms of workers' welfare, the lives of general workers have improved considerably in recent years. However, in the past two years, the wage increases of workers in production and construction enterprises have been slow, which is not commensurate with the increase in labor productivity. In 1954, the labor productivity of national industrial enterprises increased by 15%, but the average wage increased by only 2.3%; in 1955, labor productivity increased by 10%, but the average wage increased by only 0.6%, and the actual wages of some enterprise workers even decreased. This situation is mainly due to some shortcomings and errors in wage work: 1. The wage standards of enterprise workers have not been adjusted in a timely manner in the past two or three years, which is largely related to the slow progress of the Ministry of Labor's work in formulating wage reform plans; 2. In the past, some unreasonable reward and allowance systems were abolished (for example, the year-end double salary, which accounted for about 7% of the average wage of workers, was abolished; the attendance bonus, which accounted for about 2% to 4% of the average wage of workers, was abolished), but new reasonable reward and allowance systems were not established in a timely manner, and those that had been established were mostly not perfect enough. Some had overly complicated award conditions, and some had excessively low bonus rates, thus reducing workers' income; 3. The promotion system for workers is unsound. Many workers who should have been promoted have not been promoted in a timely manner. Some first-grade workers have been doing the work of third- or fourth-grade workers, but they still only receive the wage treatment of first-grade workers; 4. The piece-rate wage system has not been actively promoted. In some enterprises, the number of people implementing the piece-rate wage system has decreased, which has also reduced workers' income. In addition, work stoppages, idling, and some increases in the prices of non-staple foods in enterprises are also factors affecting the decline of workers' average wages and actual wages.

The existence of the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors in wage work shows that we have one-sidedness in handling the relationship between collective interests and individual interests, and lack a clear understanding of Chairman Mao's instruction that both national interests and individual interests should be taken into account. Therefore, we have not been able to correctly combine the development of production and the improvement of workers' living standards.

Conduct a nationwide wage reform

In order to improve wage work and further consolidate and enhance the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in building socialism, the State Council has decided to conduct a nationwide wage reform this year on the premise of appropriately increasing the wage levels of workers. After this wage reform, the average wage of workers nationwide in 1956 will increase by 14.5% compared to 1955 (this is calculated based on the original number of personnel in 1955; if the newly added personnel in 1956 are included, it will be about 13%), and the total wage bill will increase by more than 1.25 billion yuan, with an average wage increase of nearly 80 yuan per person.

Because there are currently many unreasonable aspects in the wage levels of various industries, departments, regions, and types of personnel, in order to appropriately improve them, which is conducive to national construction, when increasing wage levels this time, according to the principle of "distribution according to work," the policy of national industrialization, and taking into account the current wage situation, the relationship between the wage levels of various aspects will be improved as follows:

Regarding the wage relationship between industries and departments, according to the importance of each industry in the national economy, the complexity of technology, and the differences in working conditions, the wages of heavy industry enterprises will be increased more than those of light industry enterprises, and the wages of direct production departments will be increased more than those of other departments. According to the calculations of various departments, from 1955 to 1956, the average wage of workers in the heavy industry sector (state-owned) increased by 15.6%, the light industry sector (state-owned) increased by 12%, the non-industrial sectors (excluding the Ministry of Education and the supply and marketing cooperative system) increased by 10.9%, and state organs increased by 10%.

Regarding the wage relationship between regions, on the premise that the wage levels in all regions are improved, according to the national policy of developing key construction areas while appropriately developing existing industrial bases, the wage levels in key construction areas will be increased more; at the same time, the wage levels in existing coastal industrial bases such as Shanghai and Tianjin, which currently have higher wage levels, will also be appropriately increased. Taking the machinery manufacturing industry as an example, Shanxi (Taiyuan, Datong) will increase by nearly 20%, and Shanghai will increase by nearly 10%.

What should be mentioned here is that when the wage reform plan was first formulated last year, due to our lack of a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between existing coastal industrial bases and key construction areas in the interior, we had the idea of only raising the low ones and not moving the high ones when considering adjusting the wage relationship in various regions, which now seems inappropriate. Doing so would have an adverse impact on giving play to the labor enthusiasm of the working masses in some coastal cities that still shoulder a large proportion of industrial production tasks, and would not be in line with the policy of appropriately developing existing industrial bases; at the same time, it would also not be in line with the spirit of gradually improving the living standards of workers on the basis of developing production, because the labor productivity of workers in coastal areas is also increasing year by year. The correct approach should be: for enterprises in the same industry and with similar conditions distributed in different regions, increase the current wage levels of those that are low more, increase those that are slightly higher less, and do not move those that are too high. This is the policy adopted in this wage reform.

Many improvements must also be made to the wage relationship between various types of personnel. In order to encourage workers to improve their technical proficiency, the wage standards of senior skilled workers have been increased relatively more, with first-grade workers generally increasing by about 8% and eighth-grade workers generally increasing by about 18%. In order to encourage cadres to work in enterprises, it is stipulated that under comparable conditions, the wages of enterprise management personnel should be higher than those of state organ staff. In order to encourage people to delve into technology and accelerate the march towards science, it is stipulated that the actual wages of enterprise engineering and technical personnel should generally be higher than the wages of management personnel of the same level; the wages of professors, senior scientific researchers, senior technicians, and other senior intellectuals will be increased even more. For example, in the Beijing area, the wage standards of these personnel will be increased by about 36%; in addition, generous specific allowances are stipulated for senior intellectuals who have made special contributions in their work. In order to encourage primary school teachers, supply and marketing cooperative staff, and township cadres to concentrate on doing their own work, their originally lower wage treatment has been increased more. The wage standards of primary school teachers have been increased by 32.88%, the wage standards of supply and marketing cooperative staff have been increased by 25.87%, and the wage standards of township cadres have been increased by 68.76%. The wage standards of township cadres are still slightly lower than the wage standards of primary school teachers and grassroots supply and marketing cooperative staff, but they have been increased much more than the original subsidies. It is also inappropriate to increase them even more at once.

Other aspects of improving the wage system

In addition to making the above-mentioned improvements to the wage relationship in various aspects in this wage reform, reforms will also be made in other aspects of the wage system. In the past few years, wage systems in enterprises, institutions, and state organs have been reformed once or several times, which has substantially changed the old unreasonable wage system and established a relatively reasonable new wage system, which has played a positive role in encouraging workers to develop production and improve technology. However, those reforms were still preliminary, and because the wage system of enterprises has not been continuously improved in the past two or three years, there are still many problems in this regard. First of all, the phenomenon of egalitarianism has not been overcome. There are still many shortcomings in wage points, wage standards, worker wage grade coefficients, staff position wages, and reward and allowance systems. These will all be improved in this wage reform.

First, abolish the wage point system and the regional price subsidy system, and implement a system of directly stipulating wage standards in currency. In the past, when prices were unstable, the wage point system played a positive role in guaranteeing the actual income of workers and protecting their lives from the impact of rising prices. However, with the stability of prices and the improvement of workers' lives, the five kinds of goods included in the wage point value, namely, grain, cloth, fuel, cooking oil, and edible salt, have long been unable to reflect the actual life of workers. There are also inconsistencies between the wage point values in various regions and the actual local prices. Moreover, calculating wages with wage points is cumbersome and not conducive to promoting economic accounting. In this way, the wage point system has changed from a positive thing to a negative thing, and it is completely necessary to abolish this outdated system. At the same time, this wage reform also abolished the regional price subsidy system adopted by state organs and institutions when they switched to the currency wage system last year. This is also because regional price subsidies also have unreasonable and inconvenient shortcomings. In the future, the implementation of a system of directly stipulating wage standards in currency will be of great benefit to unifying and reducing the number of wage standards in various departments, simplifying wage calculation procedures, and promoting economic accounting.

Second, improve the wage grade system for workers. The wage grade system for workers has been established in the past wage reforms, but it is not yet sound and unified. In this wage reform, the wage grade table for workers has been revised by industry, the wage standards for workers have been uniformly stipulated, the number of existing wage standards has been reduced, and worker technical grade standards have been formulated or revised. For example, the civil engineering and construction industry has been uniformly changed to a seven-grade wage system; the non-ferrous metal mines nationwide originally had 25 wage standards, and this time they have been uniformly stipulated as 12. At the same time, in order to encourage workers to improve their technical proficiency, the difference between the wage standards of first-grade workers and eighth-grade workers has been expanded. For example, the difference for metallurgical workers has been increased from the current average of 2.87 times to 3.2 times.

Third, improve the wage system for enterprise staff and technical personnel. The current wage system for staff in factories and mines is an incomplete position wage system. Its shortcomings are mainly reflected in the following two aspects: First, the wage standards of some management personnel in many enterprises are too low. Some senior skilled workers have been promoted to section chiefs and workshop directors, but their wage income has decreased instead, so some people are unwilling to be section chiefs and workshop directors. This is detrimental to the development of production and the promotion of worker cadres. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the wage standards of these management personnel in enterprises have been increased more in this wage reform; second, the wage standards of the vast majority of technical personnel in enterprises are not determined according to the positions they hold, but according to the titles and grades of engineers and technicians. The result of doing so is that their wages have nothing to do with the positions they hold, which is not conducive to strengthening their sense of responsibility for managing production. At the same time, it has also created a situation in which technical personnel who have different responsibilities in their positions and make different contributions to the enterprise receive the same wages simply because they have the same titles and grades, which is also unreasonable. In addition to increasing the wages of technical personnel more (by adding technical allowances or stipulating higher wage standards), this wage reform generally implements a system of stipulating wages according to positions. In this way, the responsibilities and duties of technical personnel can be clarified, the treatment can be reasonable, and it will be conducive to giving play to their leading role in production.

In addition, the reward and allowance system and the promotion of the piece-rate wage system must also be improved.

After this wage reform, China's wage situation will undoubtedly undergo a new change. Not only will the wage levels of workers be substantially increased, but the wage system will also be greatly improved. However, it should be pointed out that the wage system after this reform can only be relatively reasonable, and it is impossible for everything to be perfect. There will still be some unreasonable situations, and there will still be some things that should be promoted and reformed. These can only be left for future continued handling and improvement, and cannot be "accomplished in one battle" in this wage reform.

Wages are the main income of workers and are most closely related to workers' lives. Doing a good job in this wage reform will inevitably further improve the lives of workers. However, in addition to wages, there are many other factors that affect workers' actual income and workers' lives, such as whether the labor organization of enterprises is reasonable, whether the phenomenon of work stoppages and idling is overcome; whether the labor quota is advanced and reasonable, whether technical measures are kept up with in a timely manner; whether the production and supply of daily necessities, especially non-staple foods, are sufficient and timely; whether the problems related to welfare, such as medical care, housing, rent, water and electricity fees, commuting, canteens, and nurseries, are properly resolved, etc. None of these does not directly affect the actual income and the improvement of the lives of workers. Therefore, at the same time as wage reform, we must also strive to do these things step by step. Only in this way can the wage reform better achieve the goal of developing production and improving the lives of workers.

Fellow delegates, the wage reform that the broad masses of workers across the country are concerned about will begin soon. Doing a good job in this work will inevitably play a very powerful role in promoting the early completion and overfulfillment of the country's First Five-Year Plan. Let us all work together for the successful completion of this wage reform.

Improve workers' working conditions

Below, I would like to talk about the issue of improving workers' working conditions.

In recent years, there have been many improvements in labor protection, safety technology, and industrial hygiene in factories and mines, and the working conditions of workers have been significantly improved. The vast majority of workers across the country have implemented the 8-hour work system and the one-day-a-week public holiday system (civil construction workers in the construction industry have implemented it since July 1 this year), and only some new joint state-private enterprises and handicraft enterprises have not yet implemented this system. In general, enterprises have protective devices in the dangerous parts of mechanical transmission. 93% of state-owned coal mines and most non-ferrous metal mines have adopted mechanical ventilation. Workshops in state-owned textile factories and smelting, chemical, and other factories have taken measures for ventilation, cooling, and heatstroke prevention; workers engaged in harmful health work have implemented a health care system. All of these have played a role in ensuring production safety and workers' health. The number of casualties in factories and mines has been decreasing year by year. The accident mortality rate in 1954 decreased by 16% compared to 1953, and decreased by another 5% in 1955 compared to 1954.

However, we must not ignore the other side of the situation, that is, from the perspective of the needs of developing production, labor protection work is still weak. At present, the safety facilities of many enterprises are still poor, and in particular, the policy of safety in production has not been valued by all enterprise leaders. The phenomenon of managing production but not safety still exists. In some factories and mines, the situation of overtime work, industrial accidents, and occupational diseases is still serious; in many enterprises, overtime work, excessive leisure activities, and dormitories being too far away hinder the normal rest of workers; and the care for the special difficulties of female workers is not enough. Especially since last winter, in the upsurge of socialist labor competitions, some enterprise leaders do not cherish the labor enthusiasm of workers, arbitrarily work overtime, and even condone and encourage risky operations, so that overtime work and casualties have increased in some departments. According to the statistics for the first quarter of this year, the overtime work hours of some industries have increased by one or even two times compared to the same period last year; although the number of accident deaths nationwide has decreased by 5% compared to the same period last year, the total number of enterprises affiliated to the 13 ministries of central industry, basic construction, and transportation has increased by 3%. This situation should never be allowed to continue. In recent years, although labor departments have done some work in improving workers' working conditions, the drafting of labor protection regulations has not been timely enough, and supervision and inspection have not been thorough enough.

Several aspects of strengthening labor protection work

In order to strengthen labor protection work, we should make efforts in the following aspects in the future:

1. Accelerate the drafting of necessary labor protection regulations so that there is something to follow in practical work and strengthen supervision and inspection work. Recently, the State Council promulgated the "Factory Safety and Hygiene Regulations," "Construction and Installation Safety Technology Regulations," "Regulations on Reporting Worker Injuries and Deaths," and "Decision on Preventing Silicosis," which will inevitably play a great role in promoting labor protection work in enterprises. At present, the Ministry of Labor has drafted regulations on working hours and rest time, protecting female workers, safety responsibility systems, and the national labor protection inspector system. Some are soliciting opinions from various departments and party and government departments in various provinces and cities. These regulations also need to be finalized and promulgated as soon as possible to consolidate the measures we have already implemented and need to further implement regarding improving workers' working conditions with legal systems, so as to more forcefully promote the development of labor protection work.

2. Rapidly establish a national labor protection inspector system, improve national labor protection supervision agencies, and systematically strengthen labor protection supervision and inspection work.

3. Carry out scientific research on labor protection. This matter has now become a key issue in whether labor protection work can be further developed and whether the quality of work can be improved. If many complex technical problems related to labor protection, safety technology, and industrial hygiene cannot be solved, it will be difficult to carry out the work. Therefore, it is necessary to establish specialized scientific research institutions to study and solve these problems. At present, the Labor Protection Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Labor has begun preparations, but because of the lack of scientific and technical cadres, the preparations are progressing slowly. We hope to get strong support from all parties.

4. In enterprises and enterprise management departments, it is necessary to improve the safety production responsibility system and implement the policy of "those who manage production must manage safety." Enterprises and enterprise management departments should attach great importance to safety as an inseparable part of production, and regularly plan, deploy, and inspect safety work together with production work. Accidents involving injuries and deaths should be carefully investigated, lessons should be learned from them, and recurrence should be avoided; those responsible for accidents should be seriously dealt with to strengthen the sense of responsibility and legal awareness of relevant personnel regarding safety production. At present, we must first inspect some prominent problems that still occur frequently in some enterprises, such as arbitrary overtime work and failure to guarantee workers' rest time, and take effective measures to overcome them.

The issue of workers' supplementary resources in national economic construction and the solution to urban unemployment.

Below, I would like to talk about the issue of workers' supplementary resources in national economic construction and the solution to urban unemployment.

Since last winter, after opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, on the one hand, due to the increase in industrial production and basic construction tasks and the acceleration of the pace, the number of workers needed to be supplemented by various departments has greatly increased; on the other hand, due to the fact that the number of unemployed people in cities has been greatly reduced, the phenomenon of peasants blindly flowing into cities after agricultural cooperation has stopped, and the labor force has been comprehensively arranged after the implementation of full-industry state-private joint ventures in private enterprises, a new situation has emerged in the relationship between labor supply and demand, that is, the labor supply in cities is less than the demand, and it has become very difficult to recruit skilled workers, and even ordinary labor suitable for serving as construction workers in basic construction is insufficient. This situation shows that in the future, enterprises will only be able to rely on the training of reserve skilled workers to supplement skilled workers; in the future, the construction workers needed for basic construction projects, in addition to still recruiting from cities first, the shortfall needs to be recruited from rural areas in an organized manner.

The work of training skilled workers has mainly adopted three methods in recent years: individual training in production (that is, master apprentices), worker technical training classes, and worker technical schools. In the past three years, a total of 500,000 skilled workers have been trained nationwide, which has played a great role in developing production. Worker technical schools are an important way to train reserve skilled workers. Although worker technical schools have developed considerably in recent years, increasing from 22 in 1952 to 96, and will reach 192 by the end of this year, they are still far from meeting the country's growing need for skilled workers. Taking 1956 as an example, the central departments need to supplement more than 140,000 skilled workers, while the graduates of worker technical schools are only 26,000.

In order to ensure the needs of national construction, in the future, in addition to continuing to attach importance to individual training in production (because this is the largest in number) and the work of worker technical training classes, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the work of worker technical schools, give play to the strength of various industrial sectors, run schools together, strive to run more and run them well. For existing schools, we should improve leadership and management, enrich cadres, transfer technicians and senior skilled workers with appropriate conditions to take on teaching work, improve teaching syllabuses and teaching methods, improve the machinery and equipment for practical teaching, and continuously improve the quality of teaching. The problem of training new workers is a key issue in developing national economic construction, but it is still a weak link, which should attract enough attention from us.

Solving the problem of urban unemployment in a planned way is also a major issue related to developing production and improving workers' lives. In the past six years, a total of more than 2.58 million urban unemployed people have been placed in jobs and resettled in rural areas for production through government introductions. The serious unemployment problem left over from the old society has been largely resolved. At present, the number of unemployed people left in cities is not large, and most of them have poor employment conditions. According to a survey of some cities in May this year, less than 5% of the current urban unemployed are skilled workers, and most of them are older light industry workers; ordinary workers account for about 20%; the rest are partly young students above junior high school and intellectuals who have not received professional education, a small number are business personnel, and a large proportion are people who lack cultural knowledge and technical skills, and are older, unsuitable for work in enterprises, institutions, and organs, but are still suitable for engaging in various productive undertakings in rural areas. This situation has created a contradiction in labor supply and demand: on the one hand, enterprises and institutions need people, but on the other hand, many of these unemployed people are not suitable. Precisely for this reason, although the number of unemployed people is not large at present, it will still take some time to settle all these people. In the future, the policy of solving the problem of urban unemployment is to find employment opportunities from both urban and rural areas, as pointed out in Article 39 of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program: some with appropriate conditions can be introduced to work in enterprises, institutions, or organs; some can be assigned jobs after short-term business training; young students can generally go to worker technical schools and secondary vocational schools to study or go to factories and mines as apprentices; and a large number of people need to be resettled in rural areas to engage in agricultural production or other undertakings. In order to solve the problem of urban unemployment in a planned and step-by-step manner, it is necessary to make a comprehensive plan for this work under the unified leadership of the party and government in various places, and then various departments and parties will be responsible for resettlement according to the plan, so that it can be solved quickly and well. Recently, some provinces and cities, such as Beijing, have adopted this approach and achieved good results; some provinces and cities have also formulated preliminary plans to solve the problem of unemployment and strengthened leadership over this work. Judging from the situation since last winter, due to the rapid development of agricultural cooperation, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, and national industrial construction, there are more employment opportunities. In the past few months, many unemployed people have taken up work or learning positions. Therefore, we can say with full confidence that the historical task proposed by the Party Central Committee in the Draft National Agricultural Development Program to solve the problem of urban unemployment in five to seven years can be completed and can be completed ahead of schedule.

    关于劳动工资工作  
    ——劳动部部长马文瑞的发言
    我对劳动工资工作问题发表一些意见。
    我国职工工资水平逐年有所提高，但是工资工作中还有缺点和错误
    在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善职工群众的生活，是党和政府的一项根本政策。正如李先念副总理和李富春副总理在向大会所作的报告和发言中所指出的，我国职工的工资水平是逐年有所提高的。仅以执行第一个五年计划的前三年来说，1955年比1952年全国各部门职工的平均货币工资提高了20.2％，实际工资提高了12％。同时，随着国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，就业的人数增加得很快，三年来，全国安置了失业人员116万余人，全国新增加的职工有358万余人。由于平均工资提高和就业人数增加，全国职工的工资总额，1955年比1952年增加了76％。加之物价稳定，和政府在职工生活福利方面的其他许多措施，几年来一般职工的生活，有了相当的改善。但是近两年来，生产建设企业中职工的工资提高得慢了，和劳动生产率提高的情况不相适应。全国工业企业1954年劳动生产率提高了15％，平均工资只提高了2.3％；1955年劳动生产率提高了10％，平均工资只提高了0.6％，一部分企业职工的实际工资还有降低。这种情况，主要地是由于工资工作中的一些缺点和错误造成的：1.两三年以来企业职工的工资标准没有及时地进行调整，这和劳动部制定工资改革方案的工作进展缓慢，有着很大关系；2.历年来取消了一些不合理的奖励、津贴制度（例如取消了年终双薪，约占职工平均工资的7％；取消了考勤奖，约占职工平均工资的2％至4％），而新的合理的奖励津贴制度没有及时建立起来，已经建立的也多不够完善，有的得奖条件过繁，有的奖金率太低，因而减少了职工的收入；3.职工的升级制度不健全，很多应当升级的职工，没有及时升级，有的一级工人已经做了三、四级工人的活，但是他们仍然只得到一级工人的工资待遇；4.没有积极地推广计件工资制度，甚至有的企业实行计件工资制的人数减少了，也就使得工人的收入减少。此外，企业中的停工、窝工和副食品的价格有些上涨，也都是影响职工平均工资和实际工资下降的因素。
    工资工作中以上这些缺点和错误的存在，说明了我们对于处理集体利益和个人利益的关系上有片面性，对于毛主席所指示的对国家利益和个人利益这两方面应该兼顾的方针，缺乏明确的认识。因而没有能够把发展生产和改善职工生活这两方面正确地结合起来。
    进行一次全国性的工资改革
    为了改进工资工作，进一步巩固和提高广大职工建设社会主义的劳动热情，国务院已经决定今年在适当提高职工工资水平的前提下，进行一次全国性的工资改革。经过这次工资改革，1956年全国职工的平均工资比1955年提高14.5％（这是按1955年原有人员计算的，如果包括1956年新增加的人员在内，则为13％左右），工资总额增加12.5亿余元，平均起来每人增加工资将近80元。
    由于现在各个产业、各个部门、各个地区、各类人员的工资水平之间存在着许多不合理的地方，为了适当的加以改善，有利于国家建设，在这次提高工资水平的时候，根据“按劳取酬”的原则，国家工业化的政策，并且照顾现实的工资情况，对于各个方面工资水平的关系，将作如下的改进：
    对于产业之间和部门之间的工资关系，根据各产业在国民经济中的重要性，技术复杂程度和工作条件的差异，使重工业企业的工资比轻工业企业的工资有较多的提高，直接生产部门的工资比其他部门的工资有较多的提高。根据各部门的计算，1956年比1955年，职工的平均工资，重工业部门（国营）提高15.6％，轻工业部门（国营）提高12％，非工业各部门（不包括教育部和供销合作社系统）提高10.9％，国家机关提高10％。
    对于地区之间的工资关系，在一切地区的工资水平都有所提高的前提下，根据国家发展重点建设地区同时适当发展原有工业基地的方针，比较多地提高重点建设地区的工资水平；同时，对于现在工资水平较高的上海、天津等沿海原有工业基地的工资水平，也适当地加以提高。如以机器制造业为例，山西（太原、大同）提高将近20％，上海提高将近10％。
    这里应该讲一下的是，去年开始制定工资改革方案的时候，由于我们对沿海原有工业基地和内地重点建设地区的关系缺乏全面的认识，因而在考虑调整各个地区工资关系的问题上，有过只把低的提高，高的不动的想法，现在看来那是不恰当的。那样做，对于发挥目前仍然担负着比重很大的工业生产任务的某些沿海城市职工群众的劳动积极性，会有不利影响的，是不符合于适当地发展原有工业基地的方针的；同时，也不符合在发展生产的基础上逐步改善职工生活的精神，因为沿海地区职工的劳动生产率，也都是逐年提高的。正确的作法，应该是：对于分布在不同地区的同一产业、条件相仿的企业，现行工资水平低的多提高，稍高的少提高，过高的不动。这就是这次工资改革所采取的方针。
    对于各类人员之间的工资关系，也要作许多改进。为了鼓励工人提高技术熟练程度，比较多地提高了高级技术工人的工资标准，一级工人多数提高8％左右，八级工人多数提高18％左右。为了鼓励干部到企业中去工作，规定在干部条件相当的情况下，企业管理人员的工资高于国家机关工作人员的工资。为了鼓励人们钻研技术，加速向科学进军，规定企业工程技术人员的实得工资一般的应该高于同级管理人员的工资；教授、高级科学研究人员、高级技术人员和其他高级知识分子的工资提高得更多些，例如北京地区，这些人员的工资标准提高36％左右；并且，对于在工作中有特殊贡献的高级知识分子，另外规定优厚的特定津贴。为了鼓励小学教员、供销合作社工作人员和乡干部安心做好自己的工作，对他们原来较低的工资待遇作了较多的提高，小学教员的工资标准提高32.88％，供销合作社工作人员的工资标准提高25.87％，乡干部的工资标准提高68.76％。乡干部的工资标准同小学教员、基层供销合作社工作人员的工资标准比较，仍然稍低一些，但是比原来的补贴已经提高了很多，要一次提高更多，也是不适当的。
    改进工资制度的其它方面
    这次工资改革除了对于各方面的工资关系要作以上所说的一些改进外，在工资制度的其他方面，也要加以改革。过去几年，对于企业、事业和国家机关的工资制度，都曾经进行过一次或者几次改革，相当地改变了旧的不合理的工资制度，建立了比较合理的新的工资制度，对于鼓励职工发展生产、提高技术，起了积极的作用。但是那些改革还是初步的，并且因为最近两三年来企业的工资制度没有继续改进，所以在这方面存在的问题仍然是很多的，首先是平均主义的现象还没有克服，在工资分、工资标准、工人工资等级系数、职员职务工资以及奖励、津贴制度等方面，都还有许多缺点。这次工资改革对于这些都要加以改进。
    第一，废除工资分制度和地区物价津贴制度，实行直接以货币规定工资标准的制度。在过去物价不稳定的情况下，工资分制度对于保障职工的实际收入，使职工的生活不受物价上涨的影响，曾经起过积极作用。但是随着物价的稳定和职工生活的改善，工资分值中所包含的粮食、布匹、燃料、食油和食盐五种实物，早已不能反映职工的实际生活了。各地区的工资分值也存在着和当地实际物价不相符合的情况。并且，用工资分来计算工资，手续繁杂，不利于推行经济核算。这样，工资分制度已经由积极的东西变成为消极的东西了，取消这种过时的制度是完全必要的。同时，这次工资改革也废除了去年国家机关和事业部门改行货币工资制度的时候所采取的地区物价津贴制度。这也是因为地区物价津贴同样有不合理、不简便的缺点。今后实行了直接以货币规定工资标准的制度，对于统一和减少各部门工资标准的数目，简化工资计算手续，推行经济核算等方面，都有很大的好处。
    第二，改进工人的工资等级制度。工人工资等级制度，在过去的工资改革中已经建立了，但是还不健全不统一。这次工资改革，按产业修订了工人工资等级表，统一规定了工人的工资标准，减少了现有的工资标准数目，并且制定或修订了工人技术等级标准。例如土木建筑业统一改为七级工资制；有色金属矿全国原来有25个工资标准，这次统一规定为12个。同时为了鼓励工人提高技术熟练程度，扩大了一级工人和八级工人工资标准之间的差数，例如冶金工人的这种差数，由现在的平均2.87倍提高到3.2倍。
      第三，改进企业职员和技术人员的工资制度。目前厂矿企业中的职员工资制度，是一种不完备的职务工资制度。它的缺点主要表现在以下两方面：一是不少企业中某些管理人员的工资标准偏低，有的高级技术工人提拔为工段长、车间主任后，他们的工资收入反要降低，因而有些人就不愿意当工段长和车间主任。这对于发展生产和提拔工人干部，都是不利的。为了克服这个缺点，这次工资改革对于企业中这些管理人员的工资标准作了较多的提高；二是企业中绝大多数技术人员的工资标准，都不是按照他们所担负的职务来确定的，而是按照工程师、技术员的称号和等级来确定的。这样做的结果，就使他们所得的工资和所担任的职务无关，不利于加强他们对管理生产的责任心，同时还产生了担负职务的责任轻重不同，对企业的贡献多少不同的技术人员，只因称号和等级相同，就拿同样的工资，这也是不合理的。这次工资改革除了较多地提高技术人员的工资外（采取加发技术津贴的办法或者是另外规定较高的工资标准的办法），一般的实行按职务规定工资的制度。这样，就可以使技术人员的职责明确，待遇合理，有利于发挥他们对生产的领导作用。
    此外，对于奖励、津贴制度和推行计件工资制度，也要加以改进。
    经过这次工资改革，我国的工资情况无疑地要起一个新的变化，不仅是职工的工资水平有相当的提高，并且工资制度也有很大的改进。但是应该指出，这次改革后的工资制度，还只能是比较合理，而不可能一切尽善尽美，还会有某些不够合理的情况存在，还会有一些应兴应革的事情，这只能留待以后继续举办和改进，不能在这次工资改革中“毕其功于一役”。
    工资是职工的主要收入，与职工生活关系最大，做好了这次工资改革工作，必然会进一步改善职工的生活。但是，影响职工实际收入和影响职工生活的，除了工资以外，还有其他许多因素，例如企业的劳动组织是否合理，停工、窝工的现象是否克服；劳动定额是否先进合理，技术措施是否及时赶上；生活必需品特别是副食品的生产和供应是否充分和及时；医疗、住宅、房租、水电费、上下班交通、食堂、托儿所等有关生活福利的问题是否解决得适当等等，没有一件不直接影响到职工的实际收入和生活的改善。因此，和工资改革同时，还必须力求把这一些事情有步骤地办好。只有这样，才能够使工资改革更好地达到发展生产和改善职工生活的目的。
    各位代表，为全国广大职工所关心的工资改革，最近就要开始进行了。做好这项工作，必然会对提前完成和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划起十分有力的推动作用。让我们大家一致为这次工资改革工作的胜利完成而努力。
    改善职工劳动条件
    下面，我想讲一下关于改善职工劳动条件的问题。
    厂矿企业中的劳动保护、安全技术、工业卫生工作，几年来有不少改进，职工的劳动条件已经有了显著的改善。全国绝大多数职工，都已经实行了8小时工作制和每周休息一天的公休假制度（建筑业土建工人从今年7月1日起实行），只有部分新公私合营企业和手工业企业还没有实行这个制度。各企业在机械传动的危险部分，一般都已经有了防护装置。国营煤矿93％的矿井和大部分有色金属矿，都已经采用了机械通风。国营纺织厂以及冶炼、化工等厂的车间，都已经采取了通风、降温和防暑的措施；对于从事有害健康工作的工人，实行了保健制度。所有这些，对于生产的安全和职工的健康起了保证作用，厂矿中的伤亡事故是逐年减少的，事故伤亡率1954年比1953年降低了16％，1955年又比1954年降低了5％。
    但是我们丝毫不能忽视另一面的情况，就是从发展生产的需要来看，劳动保护工作还是薄弱的。目前不少企业的安全设施仍然较差，特别是安全生产的方针还没有被所有的企业领导人员所重视，管生产不管安全的现象仍然存在。有些厂矿中，加班加点、工伤事故、职业病的情况还是严重的；不少企业中由于加班加点、业余活动过多和宿舍过远等原因，妨碍了职工的正常休息；对于女工的特殊困难的照顾也还不够。特别是去冬以来，在社会主义劳动竞赛高潮中，有些企业领导人员不爱护工人的劳动热情，任意加班加点，甚至放任和鼓励冒险作业，以致有些部门加班加点和伤亡事故增加了。今年第一季度的统计，有的产业加班加点的时间比去年同期增加了一倍甚至两倍；全国的事故死亡人数虽然比去年同期减少了5％，但是，中央工业、基本建设、交通运输13个部所属企业合计，则增加了3％。这种情况，决不应该任其继续下去。几年来劳动部门在关于改善职工的劳动条件方面，虽然做过一些工作，但是拟订劳动保护法规不够及时，监督检查也不够深入。
    加强劳动保护工作的
        几个方面
    为了加强劳动保护工作，今后应该从以下几方面来努力：
    一、加速拟订必要的劳动保护法规，以便实际工作中有所遵循和加强监督检查工作。最近国务院颁布了工厂安全卫生规程、建筑安装安全技术规程、职工伤亡事故报告规程和防治矽尘中毒的决定等，这对于加强企业的劳动保护工作必然会起很大的推动作用。目前劳动部已经草拟了有关工作时间和休息时间、保护女工、安全责任制、国家劳动保护监察员制度等法规，有的正在征求各部门和各省、市党政的意见，这些法规也需要尽早确定和公布，把我们已经实行的和需要进一步实行的有关改善职工劳动条件的措施，用法规制度巩固起来，以便更加有力地推动劳动保护工作的开展。
    二、迅速建立国家劳动保护监察员制度，健全国家劳动保护监察机构，系统地加强劳动保护监督检查工作。
    三、开展劳动保护的科学研究工作。这件事情，目前已经成为劳动保护工作能否进一步开展、工作的质量能否提高的一个关键性问题。不少有关劳动保护、安全技术、工业卫生的复杂的技术问题如果得不到解决，工作就很难开展。因而必须建立专门的科学研究机构来研究和解决这些问题。目前劳动部的劳动保护科学研究所已经在开始筹备，但是因为缺乏科学技术干部，筹备工作进展很慢。我们希望能够得到各方面的大力帮助。
    四、在企业和企业主管部门方面，需要健全安全生产责任制，贯彻执行“管生产的必须管安全”的方针。企业和企业主管部门都应该把安全提到和生产不可分割的重要位置上，经常和生产工作一并计划、布置和检查。对于伤亡事故应该认真检查，从中吸取教训，避免再次发生；对事故的责任者应该严肃处理，以加强有关人员对安全生产的责任心和法制观念。当前首先要对于一些企业中仍然经常发生的任意加班加点、对职工休息时间不能保证等突出问题，进行检查，采取有效的措施加以克服。
    国家经济建设中工人的补充问题和解决城
    市中的失业问题
    以下我想再讲一讲国家经济建设中工人的补充问题和解决城市中的失业问题。
    去年冬天以来，在反对了右倾保守思想之后，一方面由于工业生产和基本建设任务加大，速度加快，各部门需要补充的劳动力数量大为增加；另一方面则由于城市失业人员已经大大减少，农业合作化后农民盲目流入城市的现象已经停止，私营企业实行全行业公私合营后劳动力已经有了通盘安排，因而，劳动力供求关系出现了一种新的情况，就是城市中的劳动力供不应求，技术工人已经很不容易招到，适合于充当基本建设壮工的普通劳动力也不敷需要。这种情况说明：今后企业补充技术工人，将只能是依靠对于后备技术工人的培养；今后基本建设工程所需要的壮工，除了首先仍然应当从城市中招用外，不足之数需要从农村中有组织的招收。
    培养技术工人的工作，这几年主要地采取了在生产中个别培养（就是师傅带徒弟）、工人技术训练班和工人技术学校三种方式。三年来全国共培养了技术工人50万人，对于发展生产起了很大作用。工人技术学校是培养后备技术工人的一种重要方式。这几年工人技术学校虽然有相当的发展，已经由1952年的22所增加到96所，今年年底将要达到192所，但是比起国家对于技术工人的日益增长的需要来，还相差很远。就以1956年来说，中央各部门需要补充技术工人14万余人，而工人技术学校的毕业生只有2.6万人。
    为了保证国家建设的需要，今后除了应该继续重视在生产中个别培养（因为这在数量上是最多的）和工人技术训练班的工作外，特别要加强工人技术学校的工作，发挥各产业部门的力量，大家办学校，争取多办，办好。对于现有的学校，应该改善领导管理，充实干部，抽调条件适当的技术人员和高级技术工人去担任教学工作，改进教学大纲和教学方法，改善实习教学的机器设备，使教学质量能够不断地提高。培养新工人的问题是发展国家经济建设的一个关键性问题，但是目前还是一个薄弱环节，应该引起我们足够的重视。
    有计划地解决城市中的失业问题，也是有关发展生产和改善职工生活的一个重大问题。六年来，经过政府介绍就业和安置到农村生产的城市失业人员，共有258万余人，旧社会遗留下来的严重的失业问题，已经在很大程度上得到了解决。目前城市中剩下来的失业人员，为数已经不多，并且多数是就业条件比较差的。根据今年5月间部分城市的调查，目前城市失业人员中，技术工人已不足5％，并且大都是年龄较大的轻工业工人；普通工人约占20％；其余的，有一部分是高小以上的青年学生和没有受过专业教育的知识分子，有少数是商业人员，而很大一部分则是没有什么文化知识和技术能力，并且年龄较大，不适合于企业、事业和机关工作，但是还适合于到农村中从事各种生产事业的人。这种情况，就使得劳动力的供求发生了矛盾：一方面企业、事业单位需要人，而另一方面这些失业人员中很多人条件不合适。正因为如此，虽然目前失业人员的数目不大，但是要把这些人统统安置起来，也还需要一段时间。今后解决城市中失业问题的方针，就是全国农业发展纲要草案第三十九条中所指出的从城乡两方面去寻找就业门路：有些条件适当的，可以介绍到企业、事业或机关中工作；有些可以给予短期业务训练后分配工作；青年学生一般的可以到工人技术学校、中等专业学校学习或到厂矿当学徒；而很大一部分人，则需要安置到农村中去从事农业生产或其他事业。为了有计划有步骤地解决城市中的失业问题，需要在各地党政的统一领导下，对这项工作加以通盘规划，然后各部门、各方面按照计划分工负责安置，这样就可以解决得快和解决得好。最近有些省、市如北京市已经采取了这种作法，因而收到了很好的效果；有些省、市也已经拟定了解决失业问题的初步规划，加强了对这一工作的领导。从去冬以来的情况看，由于农业合作化、私营工商业社会主义改造和国家工业建设的迅速发展，就业的机会多了，几个月来又有许多失业人员走上了工作或学习岗位，因此，我们可以满怀信心地说：党中央在全国农业发展纲要草案中所提出的在五年至七年内解决城市中的失业问题这一具有历史意义的任务，是能够完成并且是能够提前完成的。
