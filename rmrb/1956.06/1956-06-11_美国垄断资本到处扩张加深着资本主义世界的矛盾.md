    Activities of Buying Up Oil Companies Cause Shocks

Xinhua News Agency, June 8th, London News: The American Texaco Oil Company is currently undertaking activities to buy up the British Trinidad Oil Company. This matter has caused shocks in British political and public opinion circles.

The Trinidad Oil Company, located on the British colony of Trinidad Island in the Caribbean Sea, is one of the largest British oil companies. This company produces one million tons of oil annually and controls about 40% of the British oil sales network. Texaco Oil Company intends to buy up this company for 176 million US dollars.

After the news of the acquisition of Trinidad Oil Company spread on the evening of the 6th, Labour Party finance spokesperson Harold Wilson immediately proposed a motion in the House of Commons, requesting the government to take action to prevent this matter. During the debate on this issue in the House of Commons on the 7th, Labour Party leader Gaitskell spoke in support of Wilson's motion. Conservative Party member Baxter said that Trinidad Oil Company is the only large British company in Trinidad. If it is sold to the Americans, it will have a disastrous impact on British interests throughout the Caribbean region.

British Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan said in his reply that the British government is willing to see Trinidad's interests protected. However, he said that the government has not yet had time to fully study all aspects of this issue. He stated that the government will make a decision after careful consideration.

Many London newspapers unanimously demanded a halt to the American company's acquisition in their commentaries. The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" pointed out that control over Britain's oil supply must not be transferred to any foreigners due to financiers' transactions. The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" demanded that all possible efforts be made to retain existing important resources in British hands, believing that these resources represent future industrial strength.

    Plans to Lay Gas Pipelines Face Opposition

Xinhua News Agency, June 7th, Ottawa News: In recent days, the Canadian public has launched a large-scale movement to oppose the laying of natural gas pipelines in Canada by American companies. The public's slogan is: "The gas pipeline must be Canadian."

For several weeks, Parliament has been fiercely debating a bill proposed by the Canadian government, which stipulates that a natural gas pipeline will be laid from Alberta Province, which produces natural gas in the west, to the central provinces. The construction and operation of the gas pipeline will be contracted by an American oil company.

The government's bill was fiercely criticized by opposition party members in Parliament. These party members pointed out that the government's bill is actually handing over Canada's natural resources to the United States. The Social Democratic Party and the Progressive Conservative Party demanded that the government immediately dissolve Parliament and hand over the natural gas pipeline issue to Canadian voters for a referendum. However, Prime Minister St. Laurent rejected this request.

The struggle against the government's bill in Parliament is widely supported outside Parliament. Many cities in Canada have held rallies to protest against handing over the construction rights of the gas pipeline to American oil companies. Signature campaigns have been launched in many places. Most of Canada's major newspapers, the trade union organization "Canadian Labour Congress," which has more than one million members, the Labor Progressive Party, and many other national social organizations have demanded that the gas pipeline be built by Canada itself.

Many large entrepreneurs and financial capitalists have suggested using Canadian manpower and capital to build the gas pipeline.

"Canadian Forum" said that the momentum of this "protest movement" is "unprecedented in Canada."

*   In South Vietnam
    French Forces Are Being Harshly Squeezed Out

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 10th: According to some figures recently released from Saigon, France is rapidly losing its traditional market in South Vietnam and being replaced by the United States.

According to Agence France-Presse, in the first three months of this year, the total value of French goods sold to South Vietnam was 440 million piastres, accounting for about 30% of the total value of South Vietnam's imports. Last year, 51% of South Vietnam's total imports were French goods, and in 1954, 76% were French goods. Thus, even if France can maintain the level of exports to South Vietnam in the first quarter throughout the year, the French market in South Vietnam will shrink by more than half compared to two years ago.

The shrinking of the French market in South Vietnam is the result of the large-scale infiltration of American goods into South Vietnam. Especially since the beginning of this year, the United States has systematically restricted South Vietnam from importing silk, cigarettes, vehicles, and other goods that were originally imported in large quantities from France through the US "aid" program, and stipulated a list of goods that can only be imported from the dollar zone. Therefore, the export of goods from the United States, Japan, and other countries that are directly related to US "aid" to South Vietnam has greatly increased. In 1954, American goods only accounted for 7.8% of South Vietnam's total import value, and Japanese goods only accounted for 3%; last year, they increased to 12% for American goods and 13.3% for Japanese goods; in the first quarter of this year, they increased even more rapidly to 23% for both American and Japanese goods.

Another result of the dumping of American goods is that South Vietnam's original industries such as rubber, sugar, and textiles are facing a major threat of suspension of work and reduced production. In the first quarter of this year, due to the large-scale import of white sugar, South Vietnam's largest sugar factory has been forced to reduce production and stop purchasing sugarcane from farmers, and many other small factories have also stopped sugar production.

According to Saigon's "Chung Sheng Bao," 60% of South Vietnam's 3,300 textile machines have stopped working due to the large-scale import of American cloth. Although the price of rubber produced in South Vietnam has fallen to 18 yuan per kilogram, a large amount of rubber still cannot find buyers. And the United States still wants South Vietnam to purchase more than 30,000 tons of synthetic rubber every year.

South Vietnam is a place rich in fruits and vegetables, but American fruits and dried vegetables are filling the South Vietnamese market. In December of last year alone, more than 1,700 tons of American fruits were shipped to Saigon ports.

    美国垄断资本到处扩张
    加深着资本主义世界的矛盾
    ·在英国·
    收买石油公司的活动引起震动
    新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：美国德士古石油公司正在进行关于收买英国特立尼达石油公司的活动。这件事引起英国政界和舆论界的震动。
    在加勒比海英国殖民地特立尼达岛上的特立尼达石油公司，是英国最大的石油公司之一。这家公司年产一百万吨石油，并且控制着英国石油销售网的40％左右。德士古石油公司打算用一亿七千六百万美元把这家公司收买过去。
    关于收买特立尼达石油公司的消息在六日晚间传出以后，工党财政发言人哈罗德·威尔逊立即在下院提出动议，要求政府采取行动阻止这件事。在七日下院辩论这个问题的时候，工党领袖盖次克尔发言支持威尔逊的动议。保守党议员巴克斯特说，特立尼达石油公司是英国在特立尼达的唯一的大公司，如果把它出卖给美国人，那就会对整个加勒比地区的英国利益产生灾难性的影响。
    英国财政大臣麦克米伦在答辩时说，英国政府愿意看到特立尼达的利益受到保护。但是他说，政府还没有时间来充分研究这个问题的各个方面。他表示政府将在经过周密的考虑以后作出决定。
    伦敦许多家报纸在评论中一致要求制止美国公司的收买行动。工党的“每日先驱报”指出，决不能允许对英国石油供应的控制由于金融家们的买卖而转入任何外国人的手中。保守党的“每日邮报”要求尽一切可能把已有的重要资源保留在英国手中，它认为这些资源代表着未来的工业力量。
      ·在加拿大·
  铺设煤气管的计划遭到反对
    新华社7日讯　渥太华消息：这些天来，加拿大公众展开了声势浩大的运动，反对由美国公司来在加拿大铺设天然煤气管。公众的口号是：“煤气管必须是加拿大的”。
    几个星期以来，议会一直在激烈辩论着加拿大政府提出的一个法案，它规定从西部出产天然煤气的阿尔伯达省铺设一条天然煤气管到各中部省份，煤气管的建筑和经营由美国石油公司包办。
    政府的法案在议会中遭到了反对党派议员的猛烈抨击。这些党派的议员指出，政府的法案实际上是把加拿大的天然资源交给美国。社会民主党和进步保守党要求政府立即解散议会，把天然煤气管的问题交给加拿大选民公决。然而圣劳伦总理拒绝了这个要求。
    议会里反对政府法案的斗争在议会外受到广泛支持。加拿大许多城市都举行集会，抗议把煤气管的建筑权交给美国石油公司。许多地方展开了签名运动。加拿大大多数重要报纸、拥有一百多万会员的工会组织“加拿大劳工大会”、劳工进步党和其他许多全国性社会团体都要求煤气管由加拿大自己建筑。
    许多大企业家和金融资本家建议用加拿大的人力和资财来建筑煤气管。
    “加拿大论坛报”说，这个“抗议运动”的声势“在加拿大是空前的”。
        ·在南越·
  正在狠狠地排挤着法国势力
    新华社河内10日电　从西贡最近公布的一些数字看来，法国正在迅速失掉它在南越的传统市场，而为美国所代替。
    据法新社报道，今年头三个月，法国向南越销售货物的总值是四亿四千万披阿斯特，占南越进口货总值的30％左右。而在去年，南越进口货总值的51％是法国货，在1954年有76％是法国货。这样，即使法国在今年全年能够维持在第一季度对南越出口的水平，法国货在南越的市场也将比两年前缩小一半以上。
    法国货在南越市场的缩小是美国商品大量渗入南越的结果。特别是今年年初以来，美国有计划地通过美“援”使用计划限制南越运进原来大批向法国进口的丝绸、纸烟、车辆等货物，而且规定了只许从美元区进口的货单。因此，美国和日本等与美“援”有直接关系的国家向南越输出的货物都大大增加。在1954年，美国货在南越的进口总值中还只占7.8％，日本货只占3％；而在去年就增加到美国货占12％，日本货占13.3％；到今年第一季度，就更迅速增加到美国货和日本货各占23％了。
    美国货倾销的另一结果是使南越原有的橡胶、制糖、纺织等行业面临停工减产的重大威胁。今年第一季度由于大量进口白糖，南越最大的一家制糖厂已被迫减产，停止向农民收购甘蔗，其他许多小厂也停止制糖。
    据西贡“钟声报”报道，由于美国布匹大批进口，南越的三千三百台纺织机中有60％停工。南越出产的橡胶虽然跌价到每公斤十八元，大批橡胶仍旧找不到买主。而美国还要南越每年购买三万多吨人造橡胶。
    南越是盛产水果、蔬菜的地方，但是美国的水果、干菜却充塞在南越的市场上。单是去年十二月份就有一千七百多吨美国水果运进西贡港口。
