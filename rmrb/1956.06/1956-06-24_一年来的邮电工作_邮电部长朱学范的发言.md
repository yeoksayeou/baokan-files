    The past year has been a year in which our country has embarked on a high tide of socialist revolution. The country has undergone great changes and achieved great victories in all aspects. Postal and telecommunications work has also made certain achievements along with the development of the new situation.
        Achievements in Postal and Telecommunications Work
      Postal and telecommunications total income overfulfilled the 1955 national plan; the completion rate of capital construction in 1955 increased by 6.94% compared with 1954. Postal and telecommunications services have also been further expanded and deepened. In 1955, a total of 2,641 self-operated postal and telecommunications service bureaus were added, an increase of 34% over the previous year; the number of agency outlets was reduced by 18%. In order to cooperate with the agricultural cooperation movement, the pace of adding self-operated institutions this year will be even faster than last year. From January to May this year alone, 6,279 postal and telecommunications service institutions have been added in rural areas. Due to the large increase in self-operated postal and telecommunications institutions, the quality of postal services has changed. Postal and telecommunications bureaus in various places have also organized many mobile service groups and small radio stations to serve key national basic construction projects, major factories and mines, forest areas, construction sites, as well as water conservancy, exploration, flood prevention, meteorology and other aspects, basically ensuring the completion of communication tasks and facilitating the masses. In terms of communication quality, the operating efficiency of mail has been improved, the connection rate of local and long-distance telephone calls has also increased compared with before, and the error rate of telegrams has also been reduced. Some work has also been carried out to improve the internal organization and management of enterprises. In the past, the management institutions of the postal and telecommunications system had huge establishment sizes due to unreasonable division of labor and lack of establishment standards. Last year, under the unified leadership of the State Council, the national postal and telecommunications management departments carried out the work of reorganizing establishments and streamlining institutions, and formulated establishment standards for administrative management personnel. As a result of the reorganization, a total of about 10,000 people were adjusted, and most of the personnel required for the more than 2,000 service institutions added last year were solved by the adjusted management personnel. Through this reorganization and streamlining, management work has also been correspondingly improved. Another major work in improving management is the establishment of a number of management systems related to production quality, business management, accounting inspection, and business supervision. Through the establishment of these systems, the quality of some production work and services within the enterprise has a yardstick for measurement. For example, Class A telegrams must be sent out within a maximum of 30 minutes in the bureau; long-distance telephone calls and manual local telephone calls are required to be connected within a certain period of time; and other specific regulations. This provides management personnel with a basis for inspecting the work of subordinate production departments and production personnel. At the same time, the specific work carried out by employees in various production positions also has a goal to strive for. It has played a good role in improving the quality of postal and telecommunications, improving service efficiency, improving equipment utilization, and encouraging the enthusiasm of employees.
    Although the postal and telecommunications work has been improved to a certain extent and the communication tasks have been completed in the past year, there are still many shortcomings and existing problems in the work. I will now focus on some opinions on the following issues:
    Promoting Agricultural Production Cooperatives
      Mail Carrier System
    1. Promoting the agricultural production cooperative mail carrier system. In the past few years, we have done a lot of work to develop rural postal services. Before liberation, there was only one postal and telecommunications institution in a general county, and some counties did not even have one. Most rural areas were not accessible to mail. By the end of 1955, each county had an average of three self-operated postal and telecommunications institutions (there were already five or six by the end of May this year), and 78% of the townships had postal routes, which could regularly receive newspapers and periodicals and mail. However, the mail delivery problem below the township level mostly depends on forwarding, which often causes newspapers, periodicals and mail to be backlogged or delayed. It is said that if the postage is fully paid for the mail and the distribution fee is fully paid for the newspapers and periodicals, the postal and telecommunications bureau has the responsibility to deliver the mail and newspapers and periodicals directly to the recipient. However, due to the vast area of ​​our country and the scattered residential areas, if the postal and telecommunications bureau wants to deliver all rural mail directly to the recipient, it will need to add a lot of postal delivery personnel, but because the volume of postal business in each village or tun is not very large, a large increase in personnel will result in waste. In order to cooperate with the development of agricultural cooperation, newspapers and periodicals must go to the countryside, and the rural mail delivery problem must be solved. Therefore, on the one hand, the postal and telecommunications bureau increases service institutions and expands rural postal routes, and on the other hand, it relies on the power of the masses to solve the problem of mail delivery below the township level. Since 1954, the mail carrier system has been piloted in agricultural production cooperatives in some areas. That is, the agricultural cooperative designates a special person to handle the mail delivery work of the cooperative members. By the end of 1955, there were more than 300 agricultural cooperative mail carriers in the country. The results of the pilot project are all very good. A mail carrier does not need a lot of time to solve the mail delivery problem of the entire cooperative, and the cooperative members can avoid delaying work due to sending letters. With the rapid development of the agricultural socialist transformation cause, the demand for newspapers, periodicals and communication in rural areas has increased. Since January this year, the agricultural cooperative mail carrier system has been promoted nationwide. By the end of May this year, there were more than 50,000 agricultural cooperative mail carriers across the country. In places where agricultural cooperative mail carriers have been established, the farmers' response is generally good, and the problem of receiving, sending and delivering newspapers, periodicals and mail in rural areas, which has not been solved for a long time, has basically been solved; the communication links between counties, districts, townships and cooperatives, especially within cooperatives, have been closely linked. In some areas, the establishment of the original "communication员" has been saved, and there is no need to send workers to deliver letters; it is convenient for farmers, especially the family members of soldiers and workers, to communicate with the outside world, saving them time. Although this system has the above-mentioned advantages, due to our lack of in-depth research on the economic conditions and characteristics of the newly established agricultural cooperatives in our country, and our lack of deep understanding of the policy of increasing farmers' income while increasing agricultural production, we did not combine the actual situation to gradually promote it in a planned and step-by-step manner, resulting in a rash advance. Subjectively, we thought it was doing good for the masses, and unilaterally demanded the establishment of cooperative mail carriers too much and too quickly. We wanted to complete the rural postal network in three or four years, as stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program (Draft), and some places even wanted to complete it in one year, which resulted in the agricultural cooperatives increasing non-productive expenditures in the early stage of establishment. In some places, the requirements for mail carriers are too high, regardless of the specific situation, requiring them to be young and strong, to be party or league members, and to have a high school education, etc., which is also inappropriate; it is even more inappropriate for individual places to require agricultural cooperatives or mail carriers to provide their own bicycles, mailbags, raincoats, straw hats, etc.; In some places, the postal and telecommunications bureaus require agricultural cooperative mail carriers to have too many shifts, and we have not given the agricultural cooperatives the due business remuneration under reasonable principles. All of these are serious shortcomings in our work in promoting the agricultural cooperative mail carrier system. Now, according to the joint instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, we are overcoming the impetuous and rash advance emotions, and are studying the plan to solve the rural mail delivery problem based on the actual situation and possibilities. Our preliminary opinion is that the postal and telecommunications bureau is responsible for delivery to the township, and the collection and delivery work below the township level is given remuneration according to the amount of business, and the local authorities take various measures to solve it according to local conditions.
      Newspaper and Periodical Promotion and Distribution Work
    2. Newspaper and periodical promotion and distribution work. In the past few years, the number of newspapers and periodicals issued has increased rapidly. In 1955, the number of newspapers issued per issue increased by 29.32% compared with 1954, and the number of magazines issued per issue increased by 38.72% compared with 1954. After the high tide of agricultural cooperation arrived, the demand for newspapers and periodicals in rural areas increased significantly. At present, the development of newspaper and periodical distribution work in rural areas is not balanced enough. In some places, the rural postal communication network and social distribution network are still very weak. In these places, there are sometimes cases where newspapers and periodicals cannot be ordered, which cannot meet the objective needs for newspapers and periodicals; while in places where the rural postal network and distribution network are relatively sound, the objective needs for newspapers and periodicals are generally met, but we underestimate the demand for newspapers and periodicals; the relevant departments emphasize the aspect that needs cannot be met; the distribution plans of newspaper and periodical agencies are generally required to be too high; in addition, many counties also publish newspapers, and general county newspapers require to be distributed for several thousand copies, and more require to be distributed for tens of thousands of copies; most newspapers and periodicals require to go to the countryside, and there is no good study of the nature and content of newspapers and periodicals to match the readership, and they are all promoted and distributed to agricultural cooperatives, lacking unified arrangements; some use organizational forces, some repeatedly persuade, reluctantly agricultural cooperatives to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals, resulting in some agricultural cooperatives in these areas ordering too many newspapers and periodicals, which has become a considerable expense for agricultural cooperatives. There is also blind development of newspaper and periodical retail in rural areas, and everyone requires to add retail copies, resulting in newspaper and periodical backlogs, or forcing the masses to buy, forming compulsory apportionment. Although we have promptly ordered the postal and telecommunications bureaus in various places to pay attention to this situation and strictly require the correction and prevention of the occurrence of compulsory apportionment, and we have conducted serious criticism at the National Postal and Telecommunications Work Conference this year. However, the newspaper and periodical distribution plan we issued this year is too high, and we do not have a good grasp of the distribution work in various places, and we have not timely and well studied and resolved it with relevant departments. We have great responsibility for the shortcomings in newspaper and periodical distribution work. We have now conducted research on the current newspaper and periodical promotion and distribution work, and will propose methods to improve the promotion and distribution work, on the one hand, to report to the leading organs for instructions, and on the other hand, to discuss with relevant departments to clarify the policy boundaries and division of labor principles of newspaper and periodical distribution work. We also hope that the party committees and governments at all levels will lead and directly control the distribution work, and uniformly arrange the promotion plans for various newspapers and periodicals. Our postal and telecommunications departments must proceed from facilitating the masses, improve the delivery of newspapers and periodicals, strengthen publicity, and actively do a good job in collection and ordering under the principle of voluntary participation by the masses.
      Rural Telephone Construction
    3. Rural telephone construction. Under the leadership of local party committees and governments, rural telephone construction has developed rapidly in the past few years. In 1955, in addition to renovating some of the original lines, more than 40,000 pole-kilometers of new lines were built nationwide, and more than 60,000 pole-kilometers of new lines were built from January to May this year. Now there are more than 400,000 pole-kilometers of rural telephone lines in the country. This scale is very considerable, and it has played a great role in strengthening rural communication links, carrying out the cooperation movement, and developing agricultural production. After the high tide of agricultural cooperation arrived, the enthusiasm of local party committees, governments, and the broad masses of rural cadres for building rural telephones soared, and the demand was very urgent. All localities have formulated plans for building rural telephones, and the number of planned constructions is very large. However, the objective needs and the actual possibilities are contradictory. The main problem is that the supply of materials and technical forces is insufficient. The production of electric wires and magnetic heads cannot keep up with the demand. As a result, in some places, there are poles but no electric wires, or there are electric wires but no magnetic heads. In individual areas, poles are erected but there are no wires, resulting in "bare poles." In addition, technical forces are insufficient. In this case, the phenomenon of emphasizing quantity over quality in rural telephone construction occurs. In some places, double lines that should be used are changed to single lines, and magnetic heads that should be used are not used, or the poles are too small, resulting in the erected lines not meeting technical standards, resulting in poor calls. Some even cannot make calls at all, causing rework and waste. In addition, maintenance personnel are also very lacking. With so many lines, it is impossible without certain maintenance personnel. This will inevitably lead to an increase in obstacles, shorten the service life of the lines, and even fail to guarantee calls. Wired broadcasting in rural areas has also developed rapidly. We have studied with the broadcasting department that broadcasting and telephones should take the same pole and the same line, but in some places, the combination is not good, resulting in interference between broadcasting and telephones. We have not grasped these problems tightly, and we have not estimated them sufficiently in advance, which is a shortcoming. We hope that party committees and governments in various places will pay attention to these problems. The postal and telecommunications management bureaus of all provinces and cities should plan rural telephone construction well according to the actual situation of materials and manpower, ensure the necessary specifications and standards, strengthen maintenance work, and avoid idle work, rework and poor construction quality, resulting in waste; in the construction of wired broadcasting, they should closely cooperate with relevant departments.
  The Postal and Telecommunications Network and Equipment Are Still Very Weak
    4. At present, there are still many problems in the entire postal and telecommunications work. The main problems are that the postal and telecommunications network and equipment are still very weak, which cannot meet the objectively rapidly growing communication needs. The technology is backward, the equipment utilization rate is very low, the management system is not sound enough, and the service and communication quality is not high. Due to the rapid development of national economic construction, the victorious progress of socialist transformation in urban and rural areas, the rising material and cultural living standards of the people, and the increasing international status of our country and the increasing frequency of international communication contacts, higher requirements have been put forward for postal and telecommunications. Objective needs are growing rapidly, and the problems existing in postal and telecommunications work have become more prominent. The existence of these problems is due to the fact that we have underestimated the leapfrog development of national socialist construction and once had right-leaning conservative ideas. On the other hand, some work is very local, such as the postal and telecommunications network in the province and the construction of rural postal and telecommunications. We have grasped too much and have not delegated the power that should and can be delegated, relying more on the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels in the local area over postal and telecommunications work. We have not considered how to adapt the deployment of some work to local conditions. This has made it impossible to solve or improve some problems that could be solved or improved in a timely manner. In the future, we must not only oppose right-leaning conservative ideas, but also overcome impetuous and rash advance emotions. In addition, we are studying the opinions of governments at all levels on the division of labor and leadership of postal and telecommunications work and the division of powers of postal and telecommunications institutions at all levels. In order to achieve division of labor and cooperation between the central and local governments, further give play to the enthusiasm of postal and telecommunications enterprises at all levels, and better develop my country's postal and telecommunications industry.
  Carry Out Technological Transformation and Adopt New Technologies
    In order to adapt to the development of national socialist construction and the needs of postal and telecommunications, in addition to gradually increasing postal and telecommunications service institutions and improving service quality, the postal and telecommunications departments must also carry out technical transformation of the original postal and telecommunications equipment in a planned and step-by-step manner, adopt new technologies, and gradually build and expand mechanized and automated communication equipment in the next few years. For example, in terms of transportation equipment, we should gradually expand mechanized equipment such as cars and motorcycles; adopt new technologies and equipment such as microwave and multi-channel carrier machines on long-distance telecommunication lines, so that one cable can carry hundreds of telephone lines; the long-distance telephone of major cities is gradually modified to semi-automatic or automatic switching equipment, so that calls between major cities can be connected by dialing a number; in addition, we must also strive to enable my country's postal and telecommunications technology to approach or reach the advanced level of the Soviet Union and the world in a not very long time.
      Current Main Work
    The main task of the postal and telecommunications departments at present is to further improve operation and management, improve work quality, improve services, actively give play to the utilization rate of existing equipment, continue to expand the service area, rationally adjust the labor organization, and formulate establishment standards for production personnel. Under the unified leadership of the State Council, reform the current wage system. Unite and educate intellectuals and technicians, mobilize all positive factors, and serve the country's socialist construction. At the same time, we must vigorously train technical cadres. We also require postal and telecommunications enterprises at all levels to widely and deeply carry out socialist competitions and advanced producer movements, actively and frequently pay attention to summarizing and popularizing advanced experiences, and improve the broad masses of employees to an advanced level. In daily work, we must also pay attention to the employees' welfare and labor protection, improve the employees' working conditions and living conditions, and continuously improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees, and complete the communication tasks with good quality.

    一年来的邮电工作
    ——邮电部长朱学范的发言
      过去一年，是我们国家走上社会主义革命高潮的一年，国家在各方面都起了很大变化，取得了很大胜利。邮电工作随着新形势的发展，也取得了一定的成绩。
        邮电工作的成绩
      邮电总收入超额完成了1955年国家计划；基本建设完成率，1955年比1954年提高了6.94％。邮电服务也更为扩大和深入了。1955年内，增设自办的邮电服务局所共2，641个，比前年增加了34％；减少了代办所18％。为了配合农业合作化运动，今年增设自办机构的进度将比去年更加迅速，光是今年一月到五月，在乡村里就已经增设了6，279个邮电服务机构。由于邮电自办机构的大量增加，邮政服务质量已经起了变化。各地邮电局，还组织了许多流动服务组和小型无线电台，专为国家基本建设的重点工程、主要厂矿、林区、工地以及水利、勘探、防汛、气象等方面服务，基本上保证了通信任务的完成，也便利了群众。在通信质量方面，邮件的运转效率已经有了提高，市内电话和长途电话的接通率也比以前提高了，电报的差错率也减低了。对于改进企业内部的组织管理，也进行了一些工作。过去邮电系统的管理机构，由于分工不尽合理，没有编制标准，因此存在着管理机构编制庞大的现象。去年在国务院统一领导下，对全国邮电管理部门进行了整顿编制、精简机构的工作，制订了行政管理人员的编制标准。整编的结果，共调整出了约一万人，去年增设的两千多处服务机构所需的人员，绝大部分是由调整出来的管理人员解决的。通过这次整顿和精简，也使管理工作得到相应的改善。在改进管理方面另一项主要工作，是建立了若干有关生产质量、业务管理、会计检查和业务监督等方面的管理制度，通过这些制度的建立，使企业内部有些生产工作和服务质量的优劣有了衡量的尺度，比如甲类电报在局内最多不能超过30分钟，一定要发出去；长途电话和市内人工电话规定要在一定时间内接通；以及其他方面的具体规定等等。这就使管理人员对于所属生产部门和生产人员的工作有了检查的依据，同时职工在各个不同的生产岗位上所进行的具体工作，也有了奋斗的目标；对于改进邮电通信质量，提高服务效率，提高设备利用率，鼓舞职工的积极性，都起了很好的作用。
    一年来的邮电工作，虽然有了一定的改进，完成了通信任务，但是工作中的缺点和存在的问题，还是很多的。我现在着重对下列问题谈一些意见：
    推行农业生产合作社
      邮递员制度问题
    1、推行农业生产合作社邮递员制度问题。几年来，我们对发展乡村邮政做了很多工作。解放前，一般的县只有一个邮电机构，有的县连一个也没有，绝大部分乡村是不通邮的，到1955年底，每一个县已平均有三个自办的邮电机构（到今年五月底已经有五、六个了），已有78％的乡通了邮路，可以定期收到报刊和邮件。但是乡以下的邮递问题，大部分还得依靠捎转，因而常使报刊、邮件积压或延误。按说，邮件贴足了邮资，报刊付足了发行费，邮电局有责任把邮件报刊直接投送到收件人手里。但是由于我国的地区辽阔，居民点很分散，如果邮电局要把所有乡村的邮件都直投到收件人手里，那就需要增加很多很多的邮政投递人员，但是由于每一个村或屯的邮政业务量并不是很大的，如果大量增加人员，就会形成浪费。为了配合农业合作化的发展，报刊必须下乡，乡村邮递问题必须解决。因此，一方面邮电局增设服务机构，扩展乡邮路线，一方面依靠群众力量解决乡以下的邮件传递问题。从1954年起，在有些地区的农业生产合作社里，试行了邮递员制度。也就是由农业社指定专人，办理社员的邮递工作。到1955年底，全国有三百多个农业社邮递员。试行的结果都很好，一个邮递员不用很多时间，解决了全社的邮递问题，社员可以不因寄信而误工了。随着农业社会主义改造事业的迅速发展，农村对报刊、通信的需要增长了，从今年一月份起，在全国范围内开始推行农业社邮递员制度。到今年五月底，全国已有五万多个农业社邮递员了。凡是建立了农业社邮递员的地方，农民的反映一般是好的，基本上解决了长期未能解决的乡村的报刊和邮件的收寄、投递问题；密切了县、区、乡和合作社之间特别是合作社内部的通信联系，有些地区，节省了原来的“通信员”的编制，也不必派工送信了；便利了农民特别是军属、职工家属等的对外通信，节省了他们的时间。这个制度虽然有上述这些好处，但是由于我们对我国新建立的农业合作社的经济状况和特点缺乏深入的研究，对于在增加农业生产的基础上，同时必须增加农民收入的政策领会不深，没有结合现实情况有计划、有步骤地逐步推行，产生了冒进情绪，主观上认为是为群众办好事，片面地要求过多、过快地普遍建立合作社邮递员，把农业发展纲要（草案）所规定的七年完成乡村邮政网，我们想在三、四年内完成，有的地方甚至想在一年内一蹴而成，结果使农业社在目前初创时期，就增加了非生产的开支。有的地方对邮递员的条件，不根据具体情况，一律要年轻力壮，要党团员，要有高小的文化程度等等过高的要求，这也是不恰当的；还有个别地方要农业社或者邮递员自备自行车、邮袋、雨衣、草帽等，这就更不应该；有些地方，邮电局要求农业社邮递员班期太密，我们更没有很好地考虑在合理的原则下，给农业社应得的业务酬金。所有这些，是我们在推行农业社邮递员制度工作中的严重缺点。现在我们正根据中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的联合指示，克服急躁冒进情绪，并根据实际情况和可能，研究解决乡村邮递问题的方案，我们初步意见，邮电局负责投递到乡，乡以下的收投工作，根据业务量多寡，给以酬金，由地方因地制宜采取各种办法予以解决。
      报刊推广发行工作
    2、报刊推广发行工作。几年来，报刊发行数量是迅速增长的。1955年报纸期发份数比1954年增长29.32％，杂志的期发份数比1954年增长38.72％。农业合作化高潮到来之后，农村对报刊的需要是显著增长了。目前农村的报刊发行工作发展得不够平衡。有些地方乡村邮政通信网和社会发行网还很薄弱，这些地方有时发生订不到报刊的情况，不能满足客观对报刊的需要；而在乡邮网和发行网比较健全的地方，一般地是满足了客观上对报刊的需要，但我们对报刊的需要量估计不足；有关部门强调了不能满足需要的一方面；报刊社的发行计划一般的也要求偏高；加上很多县也出版了报纸，一般的县报都要求发行几千份，多的要求发行几万份；大部分报刊都要求下乡，没有很好研究报刊的性质与内容和读者对象相适应，都向农业社推广发行，缺乏统一的安排；有的利用组织力量，有的再三劝说，勉强农业社订阅报刊，结果这些地区的一些农业社订的报刊偏多了，成了农业社一笔不小的开支。还有在农村盲目发展报刊零售，大家都要求加发零售份数，结果使报刊积压，或者就勉强群众购买，形成强迫摊派。对这些情况，我们虽然已及时电令各邮电局注意，严格要求纠正和防止强迫摊派情况的发生，在今年全国邮电工作会议上进行了严肃的批判。但我们今年下达的报刊发行计划是偏高的，对各地的发行工作掌握得不好，也没有及时和有关部门很好研究解决。报刊发行工作中的缺点，我们是有很大责任的。我们现在已经对目前报刊推广发行工作进行了研究，将提出改进推广发行工作的办法，一方面向领导机关作请示报告，一方面和有关部门进行商讨，明确报刊发行工作的政策界限和分工原则。并希望由各级党委和政府，领导与直接掌握发行工作，统一安排各种报刊的推广计划。我们邮电部门一定要从便利群众出发，改
  进报刊的投递工作，加强宣传，在群众自
  愿的原则下，积极做好收订工作。
      乡村电话建设
      3、乡村电话建设。在地方党委和政府的领导下，几年来，乡村电话的建设发展很快。1955年内，除了整修原有的部分线路外，全国新建的线路有四万多杆程公里，今年一月到五月新建的线路就有六万多杆程公里。现在全国共有乡村电话线路四十多万杆程公里了。这个规模是很可观的，对于密切农村的通信联系、开展合作化运动、发展农业生产都发挥了很大的作用。在农业合作化高潮到来以后，地方党委、政府和广大农村干部建设乡村电话的积极性空前高涨，要求很迫切，各地都制订了建设乡村电话的规划，规划建设的数量很大。但是客观的需要和实际的可能发生了矛盾，主要是材料供应和技术力量不足，电线和磁头等的生产赶不上需要，于是有的地方有了杆子缺少电线，或者有了电线缺少磁头，个别地区立了杆子没有线，
  成了“光杆”，加以技术力量不足，在这种情况下，就产生乡村电话建设中的重量轻质现象，有的地方应该用双线的改为单线了，应该用磁头的不用了，或者杆子太小，结果架设的线路不合技术标准，以致通话不畅。有些甚至根本不能通话，造成返工浪费。另外，维护人员也很缺乏，这样多的线路，没有一定的维护人员是不行的。必然造成障碍增多，缩短线路使用年限，甚至不能保证通话。乡村的有线广播也发展得很快，我们曾和广播部门研究，广播和电话采取同杆同线的办法，但有的地方结合得不好，产生了广播和电话的干扰现象。这些问题，我们掌握得不紧，事先也估计不足，是有缺点的。我们希望各地党委和政府，注意这些问题。各省、市邮电管理局应根据材料和人力的实际情况，很好地规划乡村电话建设，保证必要的规格标准，加强维护工作，避免窝工、返工和建设质量不好以致造成浪费情况；在有线广播的建设方面，应与有关部门密切配合。
  邮电网路和设备还很薄弱
    4、目前，整个邮电工作还存在着很多问题，主要是邮电网路和设备还很薄弱，不能满足客观上迅速增长的通信需要，技术落后，设备利用率很低，管理制度也还不够健全，服务和通信质量不高。由于国家经济建设的飞跃发展，城乡社会主义改造的胜利进行，人民群众物质、文化生活水平的上升，以及我国国际地位的日益提高，国际通信联系的日益频繁，都给邮电通信提出了更高的要求。客观的需要迅速增长，邮电工作中存在的问题也就更显得突出了。这些问题的存在，一方面由于我们对国家社会主义建设的飞跃发展估计不足，曾经存在着右倾保守思想。另一方面，有些工作的地方性很大，如省内邮电网路和乡村邮电建设，我们抓得多了些，没有把应该而且可能下放的事权下放，更多地依靠地方各级党委和政府对邮电工作的领导，对于有些工作的布置如何因地制宜考虑得不够。这就使有些可能解决或改进的问题，不能及时得到解决或改进。今后既要反对右倾保守思想，同时还要克服急躁冒进情绪。另外，我们正研究各级政府对邮电工作分工领导的意见和各级邮电机构的职权分工方案。以期达到中央和地方分工协作，进一步发挥各级邮电企业的积极性，更好地发展我国的邮电事业。
  进行技术改造、采用新技术
    为了适应国家社会主义建设发展，对邮电通信的需要，邮电部门除了必须逐步增加邮电服务机构，提高服务质量而外，在今后若干年内还必须有计划有步骤地对原有邮电通信设备进行技术改造，采用新技术，逐步新建和扩建机械化、自动化的通信设备。比如在运输工具方面，要逐渐扩充汽车、摩托车等机械化设备；在长途电信线路上采用微波和多路载波机等新式技术设备，使一条电缆能通几百路电话；主要的大城市长途电话逐渐改装为半自动或自动的接续设备，使大城市之间的通话一拨号码就可以接通了；此外，我们还要争取在不很长的时间内，使我国邮电通信技术能够接近或达到苏联和世界上的先进水平。
      当前的主要工作
    邮电部门当前的主要工作是进一步改进经营管理，提高工作质量，改善服务，积极发挥现有设备的利用率，继续扩大服务面，合理地调整劳动组织，制订生产人员的编制标准。在国务院统一领导下改革现行的工资制度。团结教育知识分子和技术人员，调度一切积极因素，为国家社会主义建设服务。同时要大力培养技术干部。并且要求各级邮电企业必须广泛深入地开展社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动，积极地并经常地注意总结与推广先进经验，把广大职工提高到先进的水平。在日常工作中，还必须注意职工的生活福利和劳动保护，改善职工的劳动条件和居住条件，不断提高广大职工的积极性，质量良好地完成通信任务。
