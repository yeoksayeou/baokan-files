    This is Not an Adventurer's Paradise
    Nanjing Normal School Sang Yuan
    "Liezi" is a work from China thousands of years ago. It contains a story about a man who longed to get a piece of gold every day, but where would the gold come from? One day, he saw many dazzling gold pieces in the goldsmith's shop next door. He was extremely envious (and jealous), so he had a "flash of inspiration" and came up with a plan. He grabbed a piece of gold from the goldsmith's shop and ran towards the center of the street. He was caught not far after. He was asked: How dare you steal gold from a shop in broad daylight? He replied: When I took the gold, I only saw the glittering gold and didn't see anyone at all!
    What a ridiculous and funny story! But today, aren't Filipino travelers reenacting it? They insist that the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea, over which China has sovereignty, should belong to them. What's the difference between this and the gold thief? Perhaps the only difference is that the latter has an excuse – the Nansha Islands are very close to them. I think, why didn't the former say that the goldsmith's shop was very close to his home? This may be because human civilization thousands of years ago was not as advanced as it is today!
    The gold thief said he only saw the gold and didn't see anyone at all after being caught, but China stands so tall in Asia, how can the travelers not see it? This is not because their eyes are nearsighted, it is a conscious act of provocation!
    Our motherland is great and beautiful, but it is definitely not a paradise for any adventurer. Our country has always advocated peaceful coexistence. Our country does not invade any country, but it will never allow any country to invade us. The guys who are itching for action should remember this.

    “列子”，是我国几千年前的一部作品，其中有这样一个故事：有一个人，成天盼望能得到一块金子，可是，金子从那里来呢？一天，他亲眼看到隔壁的金铺里有许多耀眼的黄金。他真羡慕极了（也眼红极了），于是“灵机一动，计上心来”，他从金铺中抢了一块黄金便向街心跑了。跑不多远便被人捉住了。问他：怎么大天白日竟敢到店铺中来偷金子？答道：我拿金子的时候，只看见明晃晃的金子，根本没有看见什么人！
    这是一个多么可笑，多么滑稽的故事！但在今天，菲律宾的旅行家不也正在重演它吗！它硬说主权属于中国的南中国海中的南沙群岛应属他们。这和那个偷金的人有什么区别？可能区别就在于比前者多个借口——南沙群岛靠他们很近。我这样想，为什么前者不说金店铺子靠他家很近呢？这可能是因为几千年以前的人类文明还不如今天吧！
    偷金的人被捉住后说眼中只看见金子，根本没有看见一个人，而中国是这样魁梧地屹立于亚洲，旅行家们怎么也看不见呢？这不是他们眼睛近视，这是他们有意识的挑衅行为！
    我们祖国是伟大的、美丽的，但它决非任何冒险家的乐园。我们国家一贯主张和平共处。我们国家是不向任何国家侵略的，但也决不让任何国家侵略我们，蠢蠢欲动的家伙们应该记住这一点。
