I.

Since 1953, our country has started the socialist construction of the first five-year plan. At the same time, the country has continued a series of social reforms. All these works have achieved remarkable achievements due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and the unity and efforts of the people of the whole country.

The vast number of overseas Chinese abroad, seeing the increasing international status of their motherland today and the rapid development of construction, love their motherland even more and unite more closely around it. In the past few years, the number of overseas Chinese returning to visit their homeland has increased year by year. From the facts they have witnessed, they have seen the rapid progress of their motherland and the superiority of socialism. The motherland's peaceful foreign policy has promoted friendship between overseas Chinese and the people of their countries of residence. At the same time, the situation of overseas Chinese in their countries of residence has gradually improved, and the patriotic unity among overseas Chinese has been consolidated and expanded. The cultural, educational, and welfare undertakings of overseas Chinese have also achieved many new achievements. The conspiratorial activities and slanderous propaganda of the Chiang gang abroad have suffered shameful failures and have fallen into isolation everywhere.

The tremendous progress in patriotic unity of overseas Chinese abroad is inseparable from the implementation of domestic overseas Chinese policies. Domestic overseas Chinese affairs work has made considerable achievements in recent years. The vast number of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese have also personally felt the country's concern and care for overseas Chinese and their relatives. However, there are still serious problems and shortcomings in overseas Chinese affairs work.

II.

In order to improve the lives of the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, further enhance their socialist enthusiasm and creativity, correctly implement domestic overseas Chinese policies to eliminate shortcomings and deviations in overseas Chinese affairs work, mobilize and unite all forces that can be mobilized and united, and give full play to the patriotic enthusiasm and socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to participate in the socialist cause of the motherland, it is necessary to resolutely implement:

(1) Mobilize relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to actively participate in rural socialist construction

According to statistics in April this year, more than 90% of overseas Chinese households have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and about 50% have transferred to advanced cooperatives. In a few advanced areas, such as Chao Dai Township in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, 96% of overseas Chinese households have joined advanced cooperatives.

In order to further consolidate and develop cooperatives and give play to the production enthusiasm of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese after joining the cooperatives, after they join the cooperatives, production tasks that they can handle should be arranged according to their specific circumstances, and they should participate in labor suitable for their labor capacity and wishes. For relatives of overseas Chinese who live on remittances from overseas Chinese, whether or not to participate in labor should be based on their own wishes. The cooperative may not include them in the labor plan or calculate their attendance rate. At the same time, it must be affirmed that all housework, such as washing clothes, cooking, and taking care of children, is labor. Any underestimation of housework and other labor is inappropriate. The phenomenon of forcing elderly and weak relatives of overseas Chinese to participate in labor must be resolutely stopped. For those who do not have labor habits and have difficulties in participating in labor for a while, they should be patiently helped for a long time to gradually develop labor habits and learn production techniques. All those who participate in labor production should receive reasonable remuneration like other members. If there is progress in production, appropriate encouragement should be given in a timely manner. If leave is requested for handling remittances, visiting relatives, building houses, and other legitimate matters, leave should be granted and possible assistance should be given.

Overseas Chinese who have just returned from abroad, if they are willing to join the cooperative, should be allowed to join the cooperative at any time.

The handling of the shares of cattle, farm tools, fruit trees, and fish ponds of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese joining the cooperative or cash investment should be the same as other farmers. It is strictly forbidden for cooperatives to force donations from relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese and force relatives of overseas Chinese to invest remittances.

For widowed, orphaned, and childless overseas Chinese households who lack labor and have no means of living, if they have not yet joined the cooperative or transferred to the cooperative, they should be absorbed immediately, and gradually achieve guarantees for food, clothing, education, fuel, and burial as stipulated.

When transferring from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, cooperatives should actively manage and develop a variety of sideline businesses in order to properly arrange the production of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese who have joined the cooperatives, so that most of them can increase their income. For those whose income is reduced and who do not have remittances to make up for it, so that their lives are difficult, it should be resolved with public welfare funds or other methods. Resolutely stop the erroneous behavior of obstructing relatives of overseas Chinese from engaging in sideline production.

For land entrusted by overseas Chinese abroad, after the trustee transfers to the advanced cooperative, it can be brought into the cooperative and rented by the cooperative, and a certain rent will be given. For relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese living in towns, their land can be managed and cultivated by the cooperative to avoid abandonment. If they request to join the cooperative when they return to their hometown, they should be allowed.

The cooperative must promptly and properly arrange the land foundation needed for overseas Chinese and their relatives to build houses in their hometowns. Materials and labor for overseas Chinese to build houses in their hometowns must be assisted in solving. As for the original cemeteries of overseas Chinese and their relatives, they should not be moved.

For overseas Chinese landlords in the past and overseas Chinese rich peasants who have abandoned exploitation, who have not yet changed their status and who now truly show that they love the country and abide by the law, their status should be changed according to Article 4 of the National Agricultural Development Program and called farmers, allowed to join the cooperative, and called members.

Overseas Chinese voluntarily invest in their hometowns to repair and build power stations, tractor stations, weather stations, purchase new agricultural implements, build bridges, repair roads, or run schools, night schools, hospitals, medical stations, nurseries, libraries, clubs, cinemas, film projection teams, and other public buildings, all should be welcomed and encouraged. They can be given commemorative names and treated the same as national public property. On the other hand, it is necessary to resolutely stop the practice of apportioning donations to overseas Chinese and their relatives under the above-mentioned excuses, correct any disguised forced "voluntary" donation methods, or any "mobilization" of investment.

(2) On guiding overseas Chinese to return to China for investment and the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises of overseas Chinese in China

First, on the issue of guiding overseas Chinese investment

In the past few years, the types and business industries of overseas Chinese enterprises' investments have included state-owned investment companies, joint state-private ownership, joint ventures, and wholly-owned industrial, agricultural, commercial, transportation, and social service industries. The guiding policy for overseas Chinese investment in the future is: according to the needs of the national economic plan, taking care of the wishes of investors, with state-owned investment companies as the mainstay, adopting cooperative operations or joint state-private partnership forms, while also allowing individual private investment operations (sole proprietorship, joint venture, or joint stock company), so that overseas Chinese can choose methods that suit their wishes to invest in local industrial and agricultural construction.

Establish a national overseas Chinese investment head office. The existing and planned overseas Chinese investment companies in various places will be used as local institutions and will be under the unified leadership of the head office. Overseas Chinese investment companies are state-owned financial trust enterprises.

In order to take care of the interests of overseas Chinese investors, the People's Committees of Guangdong and Fujian provinces have stipulated that overseas Chinese who invest in state-owned overseas Chinese investment companies will not have their original class status changed due to investment relations; overseas Chinese shares invested in state-owned overseas Chinese investment companies will still be owned by the investors after the socialist society is built; the dividend for overseas Chinese capital invested in state-owned overseas Chinese investment companies is set at an annual interest rate of eight percent; if investors request to participate in work, the relevant departments or enterprises should give priority to arranging them according to actual needs. The head office will discuss and revise these four preferential principles to make them more specific and clear.

In order to resolutely implement the "Regulations on Overseas Chinese Applying to Use State-Owned Barren Mountains and Wastelands" and give play to the characteristics of overseas Chinese being good at managing tropical crops, it is planned to establish overseas Chinese reclamation companies in Guangdong, Fujian, and Yunnan to invest in the operation of subtropical crop farms. Recently, relevant agencies on Hainan Island are preparing to allocate 500,000 to 600,000 mu of first-type land (areas with good soil, climate, and rainfall) for overseas Chinese to invest in and operate. The Xishuangbanna area in southern Yunnan is also suitable for the growth of tropical and subtropical crops and can be invested in. Fujian has also planned to allocate a large area of land for overseas Chinese to use. Overseas Chinese are welcome to invest in and operate. Efforts must be made to gradually realize the plan for the reclamation farm invested in and operated by overseas Chinese on Hainan Island this year, so as to gain experience as a demonstration to guide the construction of farms in other areas mentioned above.

Second, on the issue of the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises of overseas Chinese in China

The private industrial and commercial enterprises operated by overseas Chinese in China must also be transformed in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the country's overall plan and related policies. This is in the interests of all the people of the motherland and is in line with the long-term interests and requirements of overseas Chinese.

The principles for treating private industrial and commercial enterprises of overseas Chinese in China in the overall joint state-private partnership are:

When carrying out joint state-private partnership and clearing assets and verifying capital, all equity rights belonging to overseas Chinese should be recognized; for those with unclear property rights, the Bank of Communications or the enterprise should be responsible for temporary custody, actively clarify, and resolve in a timely manner. For enterprises with overseas Chinese participation in shares, after clearing assets and verifying capital, the agent of the original enterprise should explain the valuation of the property to the overseas Chinese shareholders and notify the overseas Chinese shareholders to entrust their relatives in China to handle the procedures for registering equity rights. If they do not register, they should be notified again and explained to the overseas Chinese shareholders to urge registration. Efforts should be made to contact shareholders who have lost contact.

Funds of overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese deposited in domestic private enterprises in the form of credit and loans should be repaid by the debtors. If the debtors have used such funds for enterprise production, the enterprise should be responsible for repayment. If the enterprise is in a situation where its assets are insufficient to cover its debts, it should be handled in accordance with bankruptcy liquidation methods.

For shares invested by overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in private enterprises with remittances after liberation, after the implementation of joint state-private partnership in the entire industry, the annual interest rate can be slightly higher than the annual interest rate of general joint ventures in China, which is specifically stipulated by various places according to local conditions. The employees after the joint venture must be properly arranged to ensure their jobs and lives.

When clearing assets and verifying capital, in addition to factory buildings and warehouses for enterprise production equipment that can be discounted as shares, their ownership of houses should be recognized. As for living materials and production materials that cannot be distinguished, they should be treated as living materials.

In the process of clearing assets and verifying capital, if incidents of infringement and misappropriation of remittances are discovered, they should be handled in accordance with the state's laws and regulations on protecting remittances.

(3) On implementing the policy of protecting remittances

Remittances are the main or secondary source of livelihood for nearly ten million relatives of overseas Chinese in our country. It is a reasonable requirement and in line with international morality for overseas Chinese in our country to remit their income from their own labor or various occupations back to their hometowns to support their families. We hope that the countries of residence will recognize this legitimate requirement of overseas Chinese and provide them with the convenience of remitting money to support their families.

In order to deeply implement the policy of protecting remittances and realize the first suggestion passed by the Third National Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference in 1954, that is, to reiterate the policy of guaranteeing the ownership and right to use remittances in the form of laws, the State Council, in accordance with Article 11 of the General Program of the Constitution, determined that remittances are the legal income of citizens and are legally protected. In February 1955, it promulgated the "Order on Implementing the Policy of Protecting Remittances." This resolute measure by the state to protect remittances has been warmly welcomed and supported by the vast number of overseas Chinese and their relatives. However, many regions have not carried out the implementation of the remittance policy universally and deeply enough. Therefore, in the future, it is still necessary to:

Continue to deeply implement the policy of protecting remittances. In areas where the policy has not been implemented or has not been implemented deeply, the State Council's order on the policy of protecting remittances must be made known to every household. Incidents of infringement of remittances must be seriously dealt with, and concrete measures must be taken to prevent the continued occurrence of incidents of infringement of remittances.

At present, strive to complete the agricultural development plan ahead of schedule in overseas Chinese areas. In many places, various methods have been found to solicit donations from relatives of overseas Chinese, and even take certain coercive measures to "mobilize" relatives of overseas Chinese to invest remittances in production. Cadres and the masses must be educated not to force or "mobilize" relatives of overseas Chinese to invest remittances in production. It is strictly forbidden to solicit donations from relatives of overseas Chinese to ensure that relatives of overseas Chinese use remittances to improve their lives.

Relatives of overseas Chinese will still need to rely on remittances for their lives for a long time to come. Their demand for the supply of daily consumer goods should be met as much as possible.

The remittance industry contributes greatly to serving overseas Chinese and their relatives. Contact with them should be strengthened in the future to better serve overseas Chinese.

(4) Give play to the active role of returned overseas Chinese in building the motherland

In the past few years, more than 200,000 overseas Chinese have returned to China. Under the care of party and government organizations at all levels and with the assistance of relevant departments, they have basically embarked on various posts of building the motherland. The vast majority of them have joined agricultural production cooperatives. Some have also actively responded to the government's call to participate in land reclamation and the development of mountainous areas. For those with other skills, the state has also assigned them to industrial, mining, trade, cultural, and educational departments according to their specialties. Under the leadership and education of party and government organizations at all levels, their socialist consciousness has been increasing day by day, and they have played an active role in various construction posts, and many advanced workers and model workers have emerged.

However, the overseas Chinese affairs departments have serious shortcomings in the work of resettling returned overseas Chinese. For example, in the work of resettling returned overseas Chinese, the overseas Chinese affairs departments lack the introduction of the situation of overseas Chinese abroad to relevant parties and the explanation of policies and specific practices; after the returned overseas Chinese arrive at their work posts, the overseas Chinese affairs departments rarely assist relevant parties in understanding their situation and solving the practical difficulties existing in their production and life; their understanding of the various skills of the returned overseas Chinese is not comprehensive enough, so that the work arrangement of some returned overseas Chinese is improper, and their expertise cannot be brought into play. In order to better do the work of resettling returned overseas Chinese, it is necessary to:

First, according to the State Council's instructions on the work of resettling returned overseas Chinese, continue to implement the policy of "resettlement according to origin." Except for returned overseas Chinese from Taiwan, since Taiwan has yet to be liberated and needs assistance from other regions for resettlement, for returned overseas Chinese who are resettled in their hometowns, the local administrative organs of their origin should undertake the task of resettling them.

Most of the families of returned overseas Chinese are in the countryside, and it is their wish to return home for reunion. Therefore, the main direction of our work in resettling returned overseas Chinese should also be towards the countryside. To do this work well, we must rely on agricultural production cooperatives. For returned overseas Chinese whose families have already joined the cooperative, the cooperative should allow them to join the cooperative with their families. For returned overseas Chinese who have no homes in China, the cooperative should also take the initiative to be responsible for resettlement. In the future, we must actively organize returned overseas Chinese to participate in land reclamation work under the principle of voluntariness. Some of the returned overseas Chinese have experience in operating tropical crops, and it is especially necessary to give play to the special skills of this part of the people to plant more tropical crops for the motherland.

For cultural, educational, technical, and scientific talents among the returned overseas Chinese and a small number of returned overseas Chinese who are not suitable for resettlement in the countryside, the overseas Chinese affairs departments must coordinate with relevant departments to arrange them in appropriate positions according to their different circumstances, give play to their professional skills, and serve the motherland.

Second, for returned overseas Chinese who have been resettled in various posts, overseas Chinese affairs departments at all levels must take the initiative to assist relevant parties in doing a good job in uniting and educating them. In addition, overseas Chinese affairs departments in various places should conduct a thorough inspection of the resettlement work of returned overseas Chinese in recent years, especially the resettlement work of returned overseas Chinese in their hometowns, seriously handle existing problems, summarize experience, and improve future work.

(5) On guiding returned overseas Chinese students in their studies

The motherland welcomes overseas Chinese students returning to China for further studies. For the thousands of overseas Chinese students who return to China for further studies every year, the national education authorities provide education and training and arrange for them to study. Because overseas Chinese students are diligent and eager to make progress, and schools of all levels and types are enthusiastic about caring for and taking care of overseas Chinese students, and have adopted a variety of educational and assistance methods to solve their difficulties, overseas Chinese students quickly adapt to domestic school life after returning to China for study. They can integrate with domestic students, get along well, help each other, and learn from each other. They have generally made great progress and improvement, and many have achieved excellent results and become outstanding students who are "healthy, study well, and work well." In order to better guide returned overseas Chinese students in their studies and enable overseas Chinese students who are already studying in China to make faster progress, the following points must be noted:

Vigorously run the existing three secondary remedial schools for overseas Chinese students in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Xiamen to provide overseas Chinese students who have returned to China and are preparing to enter school with good remedial opportunities, so that they can be admitted to regular schools after a certain period of remedial study.

Overseas Chinese have a glorious tradition of establishing cultural and educational undertakings in their hometowns. Since liberation, nine middle schools have been established in Guangdong and four middle schools have been established in Fujian. Overseas Chinese affairs departments in various places should coordinate with education departments to actively solve the practical difficulties in teachers, teaching, and infrastructure construction in schools run by overseas Chinese. If these schools only have junior high schools and no senior high schools, senior high schools can be added to expand the capacity of students, so as to accommodate as many overseas Chinese students as possible. When enrolling students, children of relatives of overseas Chinese should be given priority for admission with the same scores.

In addition, it is hoped that overseas Chinese abroad, especially in areas where there are no senior high schools, can establish more secondary schools, especially senior high schools and normal schools, so as to meet the requirements of overseas Chinese students for study from various aspects at home and abroad.

In order to enable overseas Chinese students in schools, especially some students with poor grades and newly returned overseas Chinese students, to catch up with the level of domestic students in a short period of time and advance side by side with domestic students, and to achieve better results in their studies, overseas Chinese affairs departments at all levels must strengthen contact with relevant education authorities and schools, check and pay attention to the study situation of overseas Chinese students in schools, strengthen their education and leadership, and teachers and domestic students should more enthusiastically and caringly help them solve various difficulties in their studies and lives. Strengthen extracurricular tutoring, encourage their learning confidence, so that they can be "healthy, study well, and work well" and become outstanding talents for socialist construction.

Those who are poor or whose remittances are interrupted and who have difficulties in life should be given necessary living subsidies or loans.

For some overseas Chinese students who have graduated from junior high school or senior high school in China and have failed to pass the entrance examination, the Ministry of Education has agreed to allow them to stay in their original schools and classes for remedial study. However, some of them are older, have repeatedly failed the examination, are unwilling to study, or are in poor health, and it is indeed not suitable for them to continue studying in school. The local personnel and labor departments should be requested to properly solve their work problems or provide them with short-term technical training to create conditions for employment.

Educate overseas Chinese students to attach importance to communication with their families abroad. Overseas Chinese abroad are very concerned about the living and learning situation of their children studying in China. However, some overseas Chinese students often neglect communication with their families abroad because they are busy studying and engrossed in their studies, which causes doubts among their families abroad. This is not right. They should be educated to understand that communicating with their families, reporting their academic achievements, living conditions, and the socialist construction of the motherland is their due responsibility. This can not only comfort their relatives abroad, but also exercise their writing skills and enable their families abroad to learn more about the various aspects of the motherland.

    目前国内侨务工作若干政策问题
    ——1956年6月8日在第四次侨务扩大会议上的报告（摘要）
    中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会副主任　方方
                         一
    从1953年起，我们国家开始了第一个五年计划的社会主义建设，与此同时，国家又继续进行了一系列的社会改革工作。所有这些工作，由于中国共产党、人民政府和毛主席的正确领导，由于全国人民的团结、努力，都已经取得了显著的成就。
    国外广大侨胞，看到今天的祖国的国际地位日益提高，和建设事业的长足发展，因而更加热爱祖国，更加紧密地团结在祖国的周围。几年来回国观光的侨胞一年多过一年，他们从自己目击的事实中，看到了祖国的迅速进步，看到了社会主义的优越性。祖国的和平外交政策促进了侨胞和侨居国人民之间的友谊，同时也使侨胞在侨居国的处境逐渐有所改善，而侨胞之间的爱国团结也日益巩固和扩大，华侨的文教、福利事业，也获得了不少新的成就。国外蒋帮分子的阴谋活动和诽谤宣传，日益遭到了可耻的失败，而到处陷于孤立。
    国外华侨爱国团结的巨大进步，和国内侨务政策的贯彻执行是密不可分的。国内侨务工作几年来有了不少成绩。广大侨眷、归侨也切身体会到国家对华侨、侨眷的关怀和照顾。但是在侨务工作中，也还存在着严重的问题和缺点。
                           二
    为着改善广大归侨、侨眷的生活，进一步提高他们的社会主义积极性和创造性，为着正确地贯彻国内侨务政策以消除侨务工作中的缺点和偏差，动员、团结一切可能动员和团结的力量，充分发挥广大侨眷、归侨的爱国热情和社会主义积极性，参加祖国的社会主义事业，必须坚决地贯彻：
    （一）动员侨眷、归侨积极参加农村社会主义建设
    根据今年四月间的统计，加入农业生产合作社的侨户已达侨户总数的90％以上，转入高级社的已达到50％左右，少数先进地区如福建省晋江县钞岱乡已有96％的侨户加入了高级社。
    为了进一步巩固与发展合作社，发挥侨眷、归侨入社后的生产积极性，在他们入社后，应根据他们的具体情况安排力所胜任的生产任务，参加适合他们劳动能力和意愿的劳动。对于依靠侨汇为生的侨眷，参加劳动与否，应听其自愿，合作社可不将其列入劳动计划，不计算他们的出勤率，同时，也必须肯定，凡从事家务劳动，如洗衣、煮饭、看小孩，都是劳动，任何轻视家务等劳动都是不妥当的。不照顾年老体弱的侨眷强迫他们参加劳动的现象，必须坚决予以制止。对于没有劳动习惯和一时参加劳动有困难的人，应很耐心地长期帮助他们逐渐培养劳动习惯，学习生产技术；凡是参加劳动生产的，应同其他社员一样得到合理的报酬；生产有进步的，应及时给予适当鼓励；如有因处理侨汇、会亲、建屋以及其他正当事务而请假时，应予准假并给予可能的协助。
    新从国外回来的华侨，凡愿意入社，可随时准其入社。
    对于入社侨眷、归侨的耕牛、农具、果树、鱼塘入股或现金投资，应同其他农民一样处理。坚决禁止合作社对侨眷、归侨强迫捐献和强迫侨眷将侨汇投资的作法。
    对于缺乏劳动力，生活无依靠的鳏寡孤独侨户，如有尚未入社转社的，应即把他们吸收进来，并按规定逐步做到保吃、保穿、保教、保烧、保葬。
    由初级社转入高级社时，合作社应当积极经营和开展多种多样的副业，以便妥善安排入社的侨眷、归侨的生产，使他们大部分人都能增加收入，对收入减少，又没有侨汇补足，以致生活发生困难的，应当用公益金或其他办法给予解决。坚决制止阻挠侨眷进行副业生产的错误行为。
    对于国外华侨托管的土地，承托人转入高级社后，可以带入社内，由社租种，给予一定租金；对于居住城镇的侨眷、归侨，其土地可由社代管耕种，以免丢荒，他们回乡时如要求入社，应予允许。
    合作社对于华侨、侨眷在家乡兴建房屋所需的地基，必须迅速妥善安排。对华侨在家乡兴建房屋的材料、劳力，必须帮助其解决。至于华侨、侨眷原有的坟地，应不予迁移。
    对于过去的华侨地主，和已放弃剥削的华侨富农分子，到现在还未改变成分，而现在又确实表现爱国守法的，均按全国农业发展纲要第四条精神，给予改变成分，称为农民，允许入社，称为社员。
    华侨自愿出资在自己的家乡兴修、建立发电站、拖拉机站、气象站，购买新式农具、造桥、修路或兴办学校、夜校、医院、医疗站、托儿所、图书馆、俱乐部、电影院、放映队以及其他各种公共建筑等，都应欢迎和鼓励；可予留名纪念，与国家公共财产同样看待。另一方面，必须坚决制止在上述各种借口下向华侨、侨眷进行摊派募捐，纠正任何变相强迫的“自愿”捐献方法，或任何“动员”投资的作法。
    （二）关于辅导华侨回国投资和对在国内的华侨私营工商业的社会主义改造问题
    第一，关于辅导华侨投资问题
    几年来，华侨企业投资的类型和经营行业，有国家经营的投资公司，有公私合营、合资经营和独资经营的工业、农业、商业、运输业、社会服务业等。今后辅导华侨投资的方针是：根据国家经济计划的需要，照顾投资人的愿望，以国家经营的投资公司为主，采用合作经营或公私合营的形式，同时也允许个别的私资经营（独资、合资或股份公司），以便华侨选择适合他们的意愿的方式投入地方工农业建设。
    成立全国性的华侨投资总公司。将各地现有的和准备设立的华侨投资公司作为地方机构，受总公司统一领导。华侨投资公司是国家经营的金融信托企业。
    为了照顾华侨投资人的利益，广东和福建两省的人民委员会已规定：凡在国家经营的华侨投资公司中投资的华侨，不因投资关系而改变其原来的阶级成分；投资在国家经营的华侨投资公司的华侨股金，到社会主义社会建成后，仍为投资人所有；对投资到国家经营的华侨投资公司的华侨资本，其股息定为年利八厘；投资人如果要求参加工作，应该由有关部门或企业按实际需要优先安置，总公司将根据这四条优待原则，讨论修改使更为具体明确。
    为着坚决执行“华侨申请使用国有的荒山荒地条例”和发挥华侨善于经营热带作物的特点，准备在广东、福建、云南成立华侨垦殖公司，投资经营亚热带作物农场。最近海南岛有关机关准备拨出五、六十万亩第一类型的土地（土壤、气候、雨量都好的地区）交给华侨投资经营，云南南部的西双版纳地区也适宜于热带和亚热带作物的生长，可以投资，福建也已计划拨出大片土地，供华侨使用，欢迎华侨投资经营。必须力争在今年内，将海南华侨投资经营的垦殖场的计划，逐步实现，以便取得经验作为指导上述其他地区建场的示范。
      第二，关于华侨在国内私营工商业
            的社会主义改造问题
    华侨在国内经营的私营工商业，也必须按照国家全面规划和有关政策，有计划有步骤地进行社会主义改造，这是祖国全体人民的利益，也符合华侨的长远利益和要求。
    在全面公私合营当中对待华侨在国内私营工商业的原则是：
    在实行公私合营进行清产核资时，凡查明企业产权属于华侨所有的，一律承认其股权；对于产权不明的，暂时由交通银行或该企业负责代管，积极查清，及时解决。凡企业有华侨参加的股份，进行清产核资后，应该由原企业的代理人将财产的估价情况，向华侨股东交代清楚，并通知华侨股东委托在国内的亲友代办登记股权的手续；如有不来登记的，应该设法再行通知，并向华侨股东进行解释，催办登记。对于失去联系的股东应该设法取得联系。
    华侨、归侨和侨眷以信用、借贷形式将侨汇存放在国内私营企业中的款项，应当由债务人负责偿还；如果债务人已将此类款项用于企业生产的，应由企业负责偿还；如果企业已处于资不抵债情况时，应当按照破产清偿办法处理。
    解放后华侨、侨眷以侨汇投入私营企业的股金，在实行全行业公私合营以后，年息可比国内一般合营企业的年息略为提高，由各地根据当地情况具体规定。对于合营以后的从业人员，必须妥善安置，以保障其职业和生活。
    在清产核资时，除了企业生产设备的厂房、仓库可折价作为股金外，应该一律承认其房屋的所有权。至于生活资料和生产资料分不清的，应按生活资料处理。
    在清产核资过程中，如果发现侵犯、挪用侨汇事件，应该按照国家保护侨汇政策的法令处理。
    （三）关于贯彻执行保护侨汇政
          策问题
    侨汇是我国近千万侨眷的主要或次要的生活来源。我国外华侨以自己劳动或经营各种职业的收入寄回家乡赡养家属，是一项合理要求，也是合乎国际道义的。我们希望侨居国承认华侨的这一正当要求，并给予华侨赡养家属汇款的便利。
    为了深入贯彻保护侨汇的政策，实现1954年全国第三次侨务扩大会议通过的第一项建议，即以法令形式重申保障侨汇所有权和使用权的政策，国务院根据宪法总纲第十一条规定，确定侨汇为公民合法收入，予以法律保障，并于1955年2月，颁布了“关于贯彻保护侨汇政策的命令”。国家保护侨汇的这一坚决措施，已得到了广大华侨、侨眷的热烈欢迎和拥护，但也有很多地区对贯彻侨汇政策还进行得不够普遍和深入。为此，今后仍须：
    继续深入贯彻保护侨汇政策。在政策没有贯彻或贯彻得不深不透地区，必须按照国务院关于保护侨汇政策的命令，作到家喻户晓，对侵犯侨汇事件，必须严肃处理，并采取具体措施防止侵犯侨汇事件的继续发生。
    在目前侨区争取提前完成农业发展规划，不少地方，已经发现用各种各式方法，向侨眷募捐，甚至采取某种强迫命令的方式，“动员”侨眷将侨汇投入生产。必须教育干部和群众，不得强迫“动员”侨眷将侨汇投入生产。坚决禁止向侨眷募捐，以保证侨眷将侨汇用于改善自己的生活。
    侨眷在今后长时期内，仍需依靠侨汇生活。对他们供应生活消费品的要求，应尽力予以满足。
    侨汇业对华侨、侨眷服务，贡献很大，今后应加强和他们联系，以便更好地为侨胞服务。
      （四）发挥归国华侨建设祖国的
          积极作用
    几年来归国华侨有二十万人以上，在各级党、政的关怀和有关部门的协助下，基本上都走上了建设祖国的各种岗位。其中绝大多数参加了农业生产合作社；有的还积极响应政府的号召参加垦荒和开发山区的建设。对有其他技能的，国家也根据他们的特长，分配在工矿、贸易、文教等部门。他们在各级党政机关的领导教育下，社会主义觉悟日益提高，在各建设岗位上起了积极的作用，涌现出不少的先进工作者和劳动模范。
    但是侨务部门对安置归侨的工作是存在着严重缺点的。如在安置归侨的工作中侨务部门缺乏向有关方面介绍国外华侨的情况、交代政策和具体作法；归侨到工作岗位以后，侨务部门也很少协助有关方面了解他们的情况，解决他们的生产生活中存在的实际困难；对归侨的各种技能了解不够全面，以致对某些归侨的工作安置不当，不能发挥他们的专长。为了更好地做好安置归侨的工作，必须：
    一、根据国务院对安置归侨工作的指示，继续贯彻“按籍安置”的方针，除了台湾籍的归侨，由于台湾尚待解放，需由其他地区协助安置之外，对于回乡安置的归侨，他们原籍的地方行政机关，都应当担当起安置他们的任务。
    归国华侨的大多数家庭在农村，回家团聚是他们的愿望，因此我们安置归侨工作的主要方向，也应面向农村；做好这个工作，必须依靠农业生产合作社，对家人已入社的归侨，合作社应允许他们随家人入社。对国内无家的归侨，合作社也应当主动地负责安置。今后我们必须在自愿的原则下积极组织归侨参加开垦荒地工作。归侨中有一部分是有经营热带作物的经验的，尤其要发挥这部分人的专门技术，为祖国种植更多的热带作物。
    对归侨中的文教、技术、科学人才及少数不适合安置在农村中的归侨，侨务部门必须根据他们不同的情况协同有关部门安置在适当的岗位上，发挥他们的专业技能，为祖国服务。
    二、对于已经安置到各个岗位上的归侨，各级侨务部门必须主动协助有关方面做好对他们的团结教育工作。此外各地侨务部门对几年来的归侨安置工作，应进行一次深入的检查，尤其是对回乡归侨的安置工作，认真处理存在问题，对安置不当的，应作适当调整，总结经验，改进今后工作。
    （五）关于辅导归国华侨学生
          升学问题
    祖国对华侨学生回国升学极为欢迎。对于每年回国升学的数千名华侨学生，国家教育机关都予以教育和培养，安置他们学习。由于华侨学生勤奋努力，积极要求进步，以及各级各类学校对华侨学生的热情关怀和照顾，并且采取了多种多样的教育和帮助的办法，解决他们的困难问题，因而华侨学生在回国就学后较短时期内，很快习惯了国内的学校生活，能够与国内同学打成一片，融洽无间，互相帮助，互相学习，普遍都有了很大的进步和提高。并有很多人获得了优良成绩，成为“身体好，学习好，工作好”的优秀学生。为了更好地辅导归国华侨学生就学，并使在国内已就学的华侨学生，能更快的进步，必须注意以下几点：
    大力办好现有的北京、广州、集美三所华侨学生中等补习学校，给已回国准备升学的华侨学生以良好的补习机会，使他们经过一定时期的补习，能够考入正规学校。
    华侨向有在家乡创办文教事业的光荣传统，解放以来，在广东办了九所中学，在福建也办了四所中学。各地侨务部门应协同教育部门积极解决华侨兴办学校的教师、教学基建等方面的实际困难。这类学校如仅有初中而没有高中的可增设高中，扩大学生的容量，以尽可能更多的安插华侨学生，在招生时，对于侨眷子女，应采取同等成绩优先录取的办法。
    此外，并希望国外华侨在侨居地，特别是尚未有高级中学的地区，能创办更多的中等学校，尤其是高级中学、师范学校等，以便从国内、国外各方面来满足华侨学生求学的要求。
    为使在校的华侨学生，特别是一些成绩较差的及新归国的华侨学生能够在短期内赶上国内学生的水平，与国内学生并肩前进，在学业上获得更好的成绩，各级侨务部门必须和有关教育机关及学校加强联系，检查和关注在校华侨学生的学习情况，加强对他们的教育和领导，教师和国内同学更应该以热情和关怀的态度，耐心地帮助他们解决学习上、生活上的各种困难。加强课外辅导，鼓舞他们的学习信心，使他们做到“身体好，学习好，工作好”，成为优秀的社会主义建设人材。
    对于家境贫寒或侨汇中断而生活发生困难者，应给以必要的生活补助或贷款。
    对于在国内初、高中毕业投考不上学校的部分华侨学生，已商得教育部同意留原校原班补习，但有些年龄大，长期落考，无意学习或身体不好，确不宜留校继续学习的，应提请当地人事、劳动部门适当解决其工作问题。或施以短期的技术训练，为就业创造条件。
    教育华侨学生重视与国外家庭通讯联系。国外华侨对其在国内求学的子女的生活学习情况是很关怀的。但有些华侨学生往往由于学习紧张，埋头攻读，少和国外的家庭通讯联系，因而引起国外家庭的疑虑，这是不对的，应教育他们懂得与家庭通讯联系，报道自己的学习成绩、生活情况及祖国社会主义建设状况等，是自己应尽的责任，这不仅能够安慰国外亲人，同时也可以锻炼自己的书写能力，并使国外家庭能更多地了解祖国的各方面情况。
