Those delegates who have flown in airplanes have had this experience: After boarding the plane, there are two concerns: first, fear of mechanical failure; second, fear of encountering bad weather. The task of meteorologists is to provide pilots with accurate navigation forecasts and severe weather warnings to ensure the safety of the aircraft from a meteorological perspective. Water, drought, cold waves, typhoons, frost, hail, snowstorms, gales, and torrential rains are the most terrifying natural enemies for the vast numbers of farmers, fishermen, herdsmen, salt workers, and the transportation sector. The task of meteorologists is to constantly monitor weather changes, make accurate forecasts and warnings in advance, and disseminate them through radio stations and newspapers so that the vast numbers of farmers, fishermen, herdsmen, salt workers, and the transportation sector can take preventive measures in advance, thereby avoiding or reducing losses from natural disasters. Large-scale basic construction projects, such as the Sanmenxia project, require various climate data as the basis for design before construction, and daily weather forecasts are needed as a reference for construction arrangements during construction. The task of meteorologists is to provide all major basic construction projects and river basin planning with sufficient and accurate climate data and the daily weather forecasts required for construction.

In recent years, with the help of the Party, the Central Government, and governments at all levels, meteorologists have made some achievements in these areas. Although the accuracy rate of current weather forecasts and warnings is not yet high, only about 75-80% (the Soviet Union and capitalist countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are only about 80-90%), because the Party and the government attach importance to it and lead the people to vigorously organize prevention work, it has had a certain effect in ensuring the safety of national economic construction and the lives and property of the people, and it has also played a role in breaking superstition and instilling scientific knowledge. During the period of reactionary rule, coastal typhoons brought significant disasters to coastal salt workers, fishermen, and sailors every year. The Shantou typhoon on August 2, 1922, resulted in more than 60,000 deaths and property losses of 70 million yuan. Since liberation, due to the issuance of warnings by local meteorological stations in advance and the vigorous organization of prevention by the Party and the government, the damage caused by coastal typhoons has been greatly reduced. The Zhanjiang typhoon on August 29, 1954, and the Hainan typhoon on September 2, 1955, were both very strong in terms of wind and rain, and the scope of the attacks was also very wide, but the casualties and losses of the people were not large, and the ships at sea were basically undamaged. The Liaodong aquatic products department statistics show that in the past, an average of one person died for every 1,000 tons of fish produced, and the enthusiasm of fishermen for production was low, and young men were unwilling to go to sea. Now the situation has completely changed. Marine accidents of fishing boats have been basically eliminated, the enthusiasm for production is high, and even young women are participating in offshore production. Fishermen are grateful to the Party and the government for their concern and help. On the Inner Mongolia grasslands, in the past, a white hair wind (blizzard) often blew away thousands of cattle and sheep, and tens of thousands of cattle and sheep were often frozen to death under the attack of cold waves. Since the guarantee of weather warnings, the loss of livestock has been reduced by 60-70%. Herdsmen generally reflect that what the Party and the government say is really effective, and going to the lama temple to burn incense and kowtow for several generations is not as useful as the current meteorological station. In the vast countryside, the four major natural disasters of water, drought, wind, and freezing have posed serious threats to farmers every year in the past. Since liberation, although the conditions for transmitting warnings are not sufficient and they often cannot be transmitted, the effect of prevention is still significant in the places where they are transmitted. For example, in some places in Guizhou, the masses automatically demolished the Dragon King Temples, saying: "We have burned incense for decades, and the Dragon King does not speak, but the meteorological station has a way." Obviously, under the upsurge of agricultural socialist transformation and the implementation of the Agricultural Development Program, the vast majority of farmers have been organized. In the future, weather forecasts and warnings will be rapidly and timely disseminated to the countryside through the vast rural broadcasting network, which will play a greater role in increasing agricultural production.

Meteorology is a young natural science. The first stage of the task is to take the atmosphere as the object, use dense and evenly distributed ground and upper-air observation networks, analyze and master the laws of atmospheric evolution, and provide weather forecasts and climate data to various departments of national defense and the national economy to prevent natural disasters and effectively utilize favorable meteorological conditions, thereby ensuring the smooth completion of military, industrial, agricultural, and transportation production tasks. The long-term task is to gradually control local weather changes by mastering the laws of atmospheric changes and using modern scientific and technological equipment to create conditions for transforming nature. For example, artificial cloud dispersal, fog elimination, and local artificial rainmaking can be gradually realized in the second Five-Year Plan. In terms of methods, on the one hand, various precision instruments are used to perform various observation tasks on the ground and in the upper air. For example, we need radar to detect thunderstorms, cathode tubes to detect lightning activity 6,000 to 7,000 kilometers away, and radiosondes to detect changes in air pressure, temperature, humidity, wind, and other elements from the ground to 20 kilometers above the ground. We need rockets to detect changes in various meteorological elements in the upper air above 50 kilometers; on the other hand, we need to use precision instruments to deeply measure seawater temperature, ocean current speed, salinity, and so on. Only when we correctly grasp the changes in temperature, air pressure, wind, humidity, and other elements in the seabed, ground, and upper air can we make accurate weather forecasts through mathematical analysis methods. Because meteorology is a science of atmospheric physics, it must be treated with physical and mathematical theories to make relatively accurate and reliable weather forecasts. In the second Five-Year Plan, we plan to use electronic computers to carry out numerical forecasting, so that we can fundamentally change the semi-theoretical and semi-empirical forecasting methods we currently use, thus knowing that meteorology is a rather complex science that requires quite high technical and scientific theories.

In order to make our meteorological business level catch up with and surpass international standards in twelve years, we must make the following efforts:

1.  Increase the number of ground and upper-air stations, especially in the southwest, northwest, and coastal islands of the weather channel. In terms of station density, whether it is upper air or ground, the second Five-Year Plan can exceed the United States. After our station network is completed, there will be an upper-air station every 200 kilometers or so, a weather station every 100 kilometers or so, a climate station every 50 kilometers or so, and a rainfall station every 20 kilometers or so. After our station network is completed, on the one hand, it can improve the accuracy of forecasts, and on the other hand, it can provide various meteorological data needed by agriculture and other economic construction departments.
2.  Focusing on improving the accuracy of short-term weather forecasts and establishing and developing long-term weather forecasts and various specialized meteorological forecasts, we will rapidly carry out scientific research work so that weather forecasts within three days can move from semi-empirical weather methods to objective numerical forecasting methods, and begin to formulate weather forecasting methods for more than three days suitable for China's conditions, as well as specialized meteorological forecasting methods for agriculture, aviation, marine, and other aspects, expand the service network and establish professional service work, and further ensure the victorious completion of socialist construction from a meteorological perspective.
3.  In order to develop meteorological business and carry out scientific research work, we not only need a large number of primary and intermediate technical cadres, but also need many senior technical cadres and research cadres; we not only need professional talents in meteorology, climate, upper-air meteorology, agricultural meteorology, and atmospheric physics, but also need professional talents in physics, mathematics, radio, agronomy, forestry, geography, and other aspects to participate in the work together. The above-mentioned talents, except for primary and intermediate meteorological technical cadres, need to be cultivated year by year by higher education departments and relevant scientific research departments to meet the needs.
4.  Extensive and precise measurement of various atmospheric physical phenomena and their evolution process is the basis of meteorological work. For this reason, it is necessary to expand the production of meteorological instruments, strengthen the appraisal of meteorological instruments, and also apply new achievements in science and technology in modern electronics and semiconductors to design and improve meteorological instruments. In this regard, we need the strong assistance of relevant industrial departments, and we also need to fully cooperate with scientific and technological units in applied physics, radio, computing standards, and other aspects.

The main difficulties we currently face are:

1.  There is an extreme shortage of senior technical cadres. There are only 104 university graduates in the national meteorological business system. Because some departments do not understand our work very well, the university graduates in agriculture, physics, mathematics, radio, and other fields that we requested to be assigned in the past have not been resolved for several years. Meteorological business is a research-based scientific business. We hope that relevant departments will assign us more university students in this area so that we can rapidly improve our business level; at the same time, we hope that the Ministry of Higher Education will expand the enrollment quota of the meteorology department or establish a meteorological college.
2.  Relatively sophisticated meteorological instruments are still mainly imported from abroad. There are great difficulties in purchasing from abroad, which not only consumes foreign exchange but also does not buy much every year. Domestic industrial departments believe that our meteorological instruments are complex, have high standards, and are not large in quantity, so they are unwilling to set up specialized instrument factories to manufacture them for us. We ask the industrial departments to designate specialized factories or set up specialized factories to manufacture the instruments needed for meteorology.

Fellow delegates, you are often very concerned about the weather forecasts and warnings published in newspapers or on the radio, which is a great encouragement to us, and can also urge us to improve our forecasting service work. We believe that with your constant concern and supervision, "unpredictable weather" will soon become very accurate; although we cannot currently "call the wind and summon the rain," local artificial rainfall can be realized in the near future; due to the large-scale construction of windbreak forests and sandbreak forests, the wind can be turned; due to the nationwide greening and the construction of large reservoirs, the national climate will be improved. All of our meteorological workers will work together with forestry workers and water conservancy workers under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and we will certainly be able to change the climate and conquer nature in the near future, just as Minister Liang Xi said, "achieve a beautiful landscape, good weather, and abundant harvests throughout the country."

    使我们的气象业务在十二年内赶上和超过国际水平
    ——涂长望代表的发言
    坐过飞机的代表们，都有这样一种经验，上了飞机以后有二种顾虑：第一，怕机器发生故障；第二，怕遇到恶劣的天气。气象工作者的任务就是要给飞行员以准确的航行预报和危险天气警报，从气象上来保证飞机的安全。水、旱、寒潮、台风、霜冻、冰雹、雪暴、狂风、暴雨等是广大农民、渔民、牧民、盐民和交通运输部门最可怕的自然敌人。气象工作者的任务就是随时监视天气的变化，事先做出准确的预报、警报，通过电台、报纸予以发布，以便广大的农民、渔民、牧民、盐民和交通运输部门事先进行预防，从而避免或减轻自然灾害的损失。大型的基本建设，例如三门峡工程，设计前需要各种气候资料作设计的依据，施工时需要每天的天气预报作施工安排的参考。气象工作者的任务，就是供给各种重大的基本建设和流域规划充分的、准确的气候资料和施工所需要的每天天气预报。
    几年来，在党和中央政府以及各级政府的帮助下，气象工作者在这些方面做出了一些成绩。目前天气预报、警报的准确率虽然还不高，仅在75—80％左右（苏联及英、美资本主义国家也只80—90％左右），但是因为党和政府的重视，领导人民大力组织预防工作，在保证国民经济建设和人民生命财产的安全方面，已经有了一定的效果，而且对于破除迷信，灌输科学知识，也发挥了它的作用。在反动统治时期，沿海的台风每年都要给沿海的盐民、渔民和海员带来重大的灾难。1922年8月2日的汕头台风，死亡人数达到6万余人，财产损失达7，000万元，而解放以后，由于各地气象台事先发出警报，党和政府大力组织预防，沿海台风的灾害已大大地减轻了。1954年8月29日湛江台风和1955年9月2日的海南台风，风雨的强度都很大，袭击的范围也很广，但是人民的伤亡和损失并不大，海上的船只基本上未受损失。辽东水产部门统计过去平均每生产1，000吨鱼就要死一个人，渔民生产情绪低落，年青男人都不愿意下海。现在情形却完全改变了。渔船的海事损失基本上消灭，生产情绪高涨，连年青女人也参加下海生产，渔民们都感谢党和政府对他们的关怀和帮助。在内蒙草原上，以往一场白毛风（大风雪）经常刮走成千成万头牛羊，在寒潮的袭击下，成万头牛羊往往被冻死。自从有了天气警报的保证以后，牲畜的损失减少了60—70％，牧民们普遍反映，党和政府说的话真灵验，几辈子上喇嘛庙烧香叩头都不如现在的气象台顶事。在广大的农村里，水、旱、风、冻四大自然灾害过去年年给农民们带来严重威胁。解放以后，虽然由于警报传递条件不够，常常传不下去，然而传到的地方在预防方面效果还是显著的。例如贵州就有些地方群众自动拆毁龙王庙，他们说：“烧了几十年香，龙王都不开口，还是气象台有办法”。显然，在农业社会主义改造的高潮下，农业发展纲要贯彻实施，绝大部分农民们已经组织起来了，今后天气预报、警报通过广大的农村广播网迅速、及时地传播下乡，将要在农业增产上发挥更大的作用。
    气象学是一门年青的自然科学，第一阶段的任务是以大气为对象，利用稠密而分布均匀广大的地面和高空测报网，分析和掌握大气演变的规律，对国防和国民经济各个部门提供天气预报和气候资料，以防止自然灾害，并有效地运用有利的气象条件，从而保证军事以及工农业和交通运输业生产任务的顺利完成。长远的任务是通过掌握大气变化的规律并利用现代科学技术设备来逐步控制局部的天气变化，为改造大自然创造条件。例如人工排云、消雾、局部的人工造雨，在第二个五年计划即可逐步实现。在方法上，一方面采用各种精密仪器做地面及高空的各种观测工作，例如我们需要雷达探测雷雨，阴极管探测六、七千公里以外的雷电活动，要用无线电气象仪探测从地面到20公里高空的气压、温度、湿度、风等要素的变化，需要火箭探测50公里以上的高空的各种气象要素变化；另一方面要用精密仪器深入海底测定海水温度、海流速度、盐份等。只有我们正确地掌握了海底、地面和高空的温度、气压、风、湿度等要素的变化后，才可以经过数理的分析方法做出正确的天气预报来。由于气象学是一种大气物理的科学，因此它必须用物理的、数学的理论处理后才能做出比较准确可靠的天气预报。在第二个五年计划内准备用电子计算机来进行数值预报，这样才可根本改变我们现在所用的半理论、半经验的预报方法，从而可知气象是一门相当复杂的科学，要求的技术和科学理论是相当高的。
    为了使我们的气象业务水平在十二年内赶上和超过国际水平，必须作如下的努力：
    1、增设地面的、高空的更多的台站，特别是在天气通道西南、西北和沿海岛屿上。在台站密度方面，无论高空或地面，第二个五年计划即可超过美国，我们的台站网完成后，每200公里左右就有一高空站，100公里左右就有一天气站，50公里左右就有一气候站，20公里左右就有一雨量站。我们的台站网完成后，一方面可提高预报准确率，另一方面可提供农业及其他经建部门所需要的各种气象资料。
    2、以提高短期天期预报准确率，建立和发展长期天气预报与各种专业气象预报为中心，迅速开展科学研究工作，使三天以内的天气预报从半经验性的天气学方法走向客观的数值预报方法，着手制订适合中国情况的三天以上的天气预报方法以及农业、航空、海洋等方面的专业气象预报方法，扩大服务网并建立专业服务工作，进一步从气象上保证社会主义建设的胜利完成。
    3、为了发展气象业务和进行科学研究工作，我们不仅需要大量的初级和中级技术干部，而且需要很多高级的技术干部和研究干部；我们不仅需要气象、气候、高空气象、农业气象、大气物理等方面的专业人才，而且需要有物理、数学、无线电、农学、林学、地理等方面的专业人才来共同参加工作。上述人才，除初级和中级气象技术干部而外，都需要高等教育部门和有关科学研究部门逐年培养，予以满足。
    4、广泛和精密地测定各种大气物理现象和它们的演变过程是气象工作的基础。为此，就需要扩大气象仪器的生产，加强气象仪器的鉴定工作，还要应用现代电子学、半导体等方面科学技术上的新成就，来设计和改进气象仪器。在这方面，我们需要各有关工业部门大力协助，还要和应用物理、无线电、计算标准等方面的科学技术单位充分合作。
    目前我们存在的主要困难是：
    1、高级技术干部极端缺乏，全国气象业务系统中只104个大学毕业生。由于有些部门对我们的工作不太了解，过去要求分配的农业、物理、数学、无线电等方面的大学毕业人才几年来得不到解决。气象业务是带有研究性的科学业务，希望有关部门多分配我们一些这方面的大学生，以便我们能迅速提高业务水平；同时希望高教部扩大气象系的招生名额或成立气象学院。
    2、比较精密的气象仪器现在主要还是靠国外进口。向外采购有很大的困难，不但消耗外汇而且每年买不到多少。国内工业部门认为我们的气象仪器要求复杂，标准高而数量不多，所以也不愿设专门仪器工厂为我们制造。我们要求工业部门指定专门工厂或专门设厂为我们制造气象上所需要的仪器。
    各位代表，你们经常很关心报上或电台上发布的天气预报和警报，这对我们是莫大的鼓励，同时也可督促我们改进我们的预报服务工作。我们相信，有了你们经常的关心与督促，“天有不测风云”将很快地变为测得很准；目前我们虽然不能“呼风唤雨”，但在不久的将来，局部的人工降雨即可实现；由于防风林、防砂林的大规模建设，可以使风转向；由于全国的绿化、大水库的兴建，全国的气候将有所改善。我们全体气象工作者将与林业工作者、水利工作者一起在党中央与毛主席的领导下，在不久的将来一定能够做到改变气候，征服自然，正如梁希部长所说的“做到全国山青水秀、风调雨顺。”
