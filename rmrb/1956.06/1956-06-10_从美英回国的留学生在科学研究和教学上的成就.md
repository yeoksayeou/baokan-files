Achievements in Scientific Research and Teaching by Students Returning from the U.S. and U.K.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch To date, 122 Chinese students who returned from countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom after liberation are engaged in important work in scientific research institutions and universities in Shanghai. Many of them have already made excellent achievements.
    The work of returned students is determined based on their specializations and aspirations. The returned students who serve as researchers and associate researchers in the various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai all have their own laboratories, research assistants, and technicians.
    Metallurgist Wu Ziliang, a student who returned from the United States, established a physical metallurgy group at the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Wu Ziliang has successfully researched and developed a new type of steel for the country that can be used to manufacture automobile parts—manganese-molybdenum low-alloy steel, bronze oil-impregnated bearings used in textile machinery to solve the difficulty of oiling, and copper-lead bearing alloys used to manufacture bearings that run fast and carry large loads. Microbial physiologist Shen Shan-chiung, a student who returned from the United States, and his assistants have conducted a series of studies on the physiology of chlortetracycline and the production of chlortetracycline for more than three years. Their work won the first prize of the collective award of the Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in April this year. Biochemist Cao Tianqin, a student who returned from the United Kingdom in 1952, continued to use modern technology to study proteins and made achievements in the study of muscle proteins and connective tissue proteins. Cao Tianqin also paid attention to training young scientific workers in his work. In April of this year, he won the first prize of the individual award of the Shanghai Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Cao Tianqin gloriously joined the Communist Party of China in May.
    Zhu Cheng, director of the Mechanics Teaching and Research Group of Jiaotong University and a student who returned from the United States, lectures on courses that are very popular with students. Entrusted by the Ministry of Higher Education, Zhu Cheng is compiling mechanics textbooks for universities. Yan Haojing, deputy director of the Textile Department of the East China Institute of Textile Technology, was selected as a representative of the education sector to attend the National Congress of Advanced Producers due to his achievements in teaching new professional courses and scientific research.

    从美英回国的留学生在科学研究和教学上的成就
    新华社讯　到目前为止，已经有122个解放后从美、英等国家回国的中国留学生，在上海的科学研究机构和高等学校里担任着重要的工作。他们当中许多人已作出优良的成绩。
    归国的留学生的工作，是根据他们的专长和志愿确定的。在中国科学院上海各个研究所里担任研究员和副研究员的留学生，都有自己的实验室、研究助手和技术人员。
    冶金学家、美国留学生吴自良，在中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所里建立了一个物理冶金组。吴自良已为国家研究成功一种可以制造汽车零件的新的钢种——锰钼低合金钢，用于纺织机械以解决加油困难的青铜含油轴承，和用以制造运转快、负荷量大的轴承的铜铅轴承合金。微生物生理学家、关国留学生沈善炯和他的助手们三年多来就金霉菌的生理和金霉素的生产进行了一系列的研究，他们的工作在今年四月获得中国科学院植物生理研究所集体一等奖。生物化学家、英国留学生曹天钦1952年回国后，继续采用近代技术研究蛋白质，在肌肉蛋白和结缔组织蛋白的研究上有了成绩。曹天钦在工作中还注意培养青年科学工作者。今年四月他获得中国科学院生理生化研究所个人一等奖。曹天钦在五月已光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    交通大学力学教研组主任、美国留学生朱城讲授的课程，很受学生欢迎。朱城受高等教育部的委托，正在编写高等学校用的力学教材。华东纺织工学院纺织系副主任严灏景，由于在教授新的专业课程和科学研究方面的成绩，被选为出席全国先进生产者代表会议的教育界代表。
