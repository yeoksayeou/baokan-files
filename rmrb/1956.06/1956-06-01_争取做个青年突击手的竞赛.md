The Youth League Committee of the Third Engineering Area of the Northwest Second Engineering Company launched a competition among young people in mid-April to become youth shock workers. Now, over 1,000 people have joined the competition, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of young people in the entire engineering area.

Through the youth shock worker competition, a wave of enthusiasm for actively learning from advanced examples has been set off among young people in the entire engineering area. In the first half of May, the amount of earthwork dug by the workers did not meet the quota. After joint research, they created the sliding pole method of transporting earth, which doubled work efficiency. In the third engineering section, eleven young people who previously did not abide by labor discipline and were sloppy in their work have now become active and willing to work hard. Among them, two were even named advanced producers of the engineering area in April. In April, thirty-five of the entire engineering area's thirty-seven youth shock teams overfulfilled their tasks.

Recently, this engineering area held a naming convention for youth shock workers, and forty-nine young people were named youth shock workers. (Shaanxi People's Broadcasting Station)

    争取做个青年突击手的竞赛
    西北第二工程公司第三工区青年团委，四月中旬在青年中发起了做个青年突击手的竞赛，现在参加竞赛的已经有一千人，占全工区青年总数的90％以上。
    通过青年突击手竞赛，全工区青年掀起了积极学习先进的热潮。五月上半月工人们挖土方达不到定额，大家共同研究创造了滑竿运土法，提高工作效率一倍。第三工段原来有十一个青年不大遵守劳动纪律，工作马虎，现在都变得积极肯干了，其中有两个还被评为四月份工区的先进生产者。全工区三十七个青年突击队，四月份有三十五个超额完成了任务。
    最近，这个工区召开了青年突击手命名大会，有四十九名青年被称为青年突击手。（陕西人民广播电台）
