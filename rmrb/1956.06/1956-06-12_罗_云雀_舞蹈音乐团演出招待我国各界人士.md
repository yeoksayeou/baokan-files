Among them were wooden piccolo solos, solos on the "Cobza," one of Romania's oldest folk stringed instruments, as well as performances on the hammered dulcimer and bass clarinet. The singing of both male and female musicians was a great success.

    罗“云雀”舞蹈音乐团演出招待我国各界人士
    据新华社11日讯　罗马尼亚“云雀”民间舞蹈音乐团今晚演出了精采的节目，招待中国国家领导工作人员和各界人士。
    周恩来总理和其他国家领导工作人员贺龙、乌兰夫、李富春、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、张鼎丞、张治中、傅作义以及国家领导机关各部门负责人，文化艺术界以及其他各界著名人士一千五百多人出席了今晚招待会。罗马尼亚驻华大使馆临时代办孟天努也出席了招待会。
    在演出休息时，周恩来总理会见了舞蹈音乐团团长亚尼·尼古拉，第一副团长纳斯道维奇·彼特列，第二副团长班道·斯捷凡，艺术指导兼音乐总指挥维奥列尔·道鲍斯，舞蹈指导玛拉·卡普和其他艺术家，同他们进行了交谈。
    演出一开始，舞剧“索美什河流一带的婚礼”就以优美的舞姿和有趣的情节，把观众带进了罗马尼亚民间的生活美境中去。穿插在各种罗马尼亚的民间舞蹈节目中，艺术家们还表演了中国红绸舞。
    在今晚演出的音乐节目中，大部分都是用罗马尼亚人民特有的民族乐器演奏。其中有木制的短笛独奏，有罗马尼亚最古的民间弦乐器之一“柯布什”独奏，还有大洋琴、大黑管等演奏。男女音乐家们的歌唱都获得了极大的成功。华沙第五届世界青年与学生联欢节获奖者、女高音独唱者安节拉·莫尔多万在歌唱中国民歌时，受到观众一再鼓掌欢迎，她一连重唱了两次。
    演出结束后，北京的文艺工作者们向罗马尼亚的艺术家们献花。周恩来总理等人也走上台去对他们成功的演出表示祝贺。
