Xinhua News Agency, June 12th—The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on June 12, 1956. The full text is as follows:

    In the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States, the Chinese side has consistently maintained that the talks should lead to a peaceful resolution of the disputes between China and the United States, first and foremost by seeking and determining practical ways to ease and eliminate the tension in the Taiwan region. To this end, the Chinese side has made unremitting efforts and proposed the reasonable suggestion of holding a Sino-U.S. Foreign Ministers' meeting long ago. However, the United States has consistently insisted on requiring China to recognize the status quo of U.S. interference in China's internal affairs and occupation of Taiwan, and has refused to give any definite indication of holding a Sino-U.S. Foreign Ministers' meeting.

    On April 19, 1956, the U.S. side proposed a draft agreement statement in the Sino-U.S. talks. The full text of the draft is as follows:

    “Ambassador Johnson, representing the Government of the United States of America, and Ambassador Wang Bingnan, representing the Government of the People's Republic of China, agree that, without prejudice to the inherent right of either party to pursue its policies by peaceful means or to individual or collective self-defense, declare:

    The United States of America and the People's Republic of China express their determination that they should resolve disputes between them through peaceful negotiation, without resorting to the threat or use of force in the Taiwan area or elsewhere;

    The two ambassadors should continue talks to seek practical ways to achieve this common desire."

    In this draft, the United States not only demanded that China recognize the status quo of U.S. use of force and threats of force to invade and occupy China's territory of Taiwan and interfere with China's liberation of coastal islands, but also demanded that China recognize the so-called right of the United States to self-defense in the Taiwan region, and recognize that U.S. armed occupation of Taiwan is a legitimate act; however, on the other hand, the U.S. draft made no mention of holding a Sino-U.S. Foreign Ministers' meeting. This shows that the U.S. attempt is still to have the Chinese side agree to issue a statement freezing the status quo in the Taiwan region, and then indefinitely delay the Foreign Ministers' meeting, without conducting peaceful negotiations to resolve the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan region, so that the United States can continue to occupy Taiwan and interfere with China's liberation of coastal islands. Obviously, this is by no means a statement by the Chinese and American sides to peacefully resolve their disputes without resorting to force, but a statement requiring China to recognize U.S. aggression, which the Chinese side certainly cannot accept.

    However, considering that the U.S. side has repeatedly requested that the statement should explicitly apply to the Taiwan region, the Chinese side once again made an effort and proposed the following draft agreement statement on May 11, 1956:

    “Ambassador Wang Bingnan, representing the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Ambassador Johnson, representing the Government of the United States of America, agree that, without prejudice to the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, declare:

    The People's Republic of China and the United States of America express their determination that they should resolve disputes between them in the Taiwan region through peaceful negotiation without resorting to threats or the use of force against each other;

    The two ambassadors should continue talks to seek and determine practical ways to achieve this common desire, including holding a Sino-U.S. Foreign Ministers' meeting, and make concrete arrangements within two months."

    Given that the United States has already used force and threats of force to invade and occupy Chinese territory of Taiwan, the Chinese side believes that if, in accordance with the U.S. suggestion, the principle that both sides should resolve disputes between the two countries through peaceful negotiations without resorting to threats or the use of force is specifically applied to the Taiwan region, it is also necessary to make clear and undeniable provisions for seeking and determining ways to resolve the tension in the Taiwan region. Only in this way can the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks not be protracted for a long time, and the issue of tension in the Taiwan region have the possibility of being resolved. Therefore, the draft proposed by the Chinese side stipulates that within two months after the statement is issued, the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks should seek and determine practical ways, including holding a Sino-U.S. Foreign Ministers' meeting, and make specific arrangements.

    The Chinese side firmly believes that if the U.S. side has any sincerity in peacefully resolving the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan region, then there is no reason to continue delaying the talks without reaching an agreement on this draft statement proposed by the Chinese side. The whole world is eager for the tension in the Taiwan region to be eliminated and is worried about the inevitable consequences of the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks not being able to reach an agreement for a long time. The Chinese side believes that it is necessary to make the above situation public.

### 我国外交部就中美会谈情况发表声明  重申和平解决台湾地区紧张局势问题的主张

    我国外交部就中美会谈情况发表声明
    重申和平解决台湾地区紧张局势问题的主张
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国外交部在1956年6月12日发表声明。全文如下：
    在中美两国大使级的会谈中，中国方面一贯主张会谈应该导致中美两国间争端的和平解决，首先是为和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势寻求和确定切实可行的途径。为此，中国方面作了不断的努力，并且很早就提出了举行中美外长会议的合理主张。但是，美国却一直坚持要求中国承认美国干涉中国内政和霸占台湾的现状，拒绝对举行中美外长会议作任何肯定的表示。
    1956年4月19日，美国方面在中美会谈中提出一项协议声明的草案。草案全文如下：
      “约翰逊大使代表美利坚合众国政府、王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国政府协议，在不损害各方用和平方法执行自己的政策，也不损害各方的单独或集体自卫的固有权利的情况下，声明：
    美利坚合众国和中华人民共和国表示决心，它们应该通过和平谈判解决它们两国之间的争端，而不在台湾地区或其他地方诉诸威胁或武力；
    两国大使应该继续会谈，寻求实现这一共同愿望的切实可行的途径。”
    美国在这个草案中，不仅要求中国承认美国使用武力和武力威胁侵占中国的领土台湾和干涉中国解放沿海岛屿的现状，而且还要求中国承认美国在台湾地区有所谓自卫的权利，承认美国武力侵占台湾是合法的行为；但是，另一方面，美国草案对于举行中美外长会议却只字不提。这表明，美方的企图仍旧是要中国方面同意发表一个冻结台湾地区现状的声明，然后长期拖延不开外长会议，不进行和平谈判解决中美两国之间在台湾地区的争端，以便美国继续霸占台湾和干涉中国解放沿海岛屿。很显然，这绝不是一个中美双方和平解决彼此之间的争端而不诉诸武力的声明，而是一个要求中国承认美国侵略的声明，这当然是中国方面不能接受的。
    但是，考虑到美方一再要求双方声明应该明确地适用于台湾地区，中国方面又一次作了努力，在1956年5月11日提出了以下的协议声明草案：
      “王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国政府、约翰逊大使代表美利坚合众国政府协议，在不损害互相尊重领土完整和主权和互不干涉内政的原则的情况下，声明：
    中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国表示决心，它们应该通过和平谈判解决它们两国之间在台湾地区的争端而互不诉诸威胁或武力；
    两国大使应该继续会谈，在两个月内寻求和确定实现这一共同愿望的切实可行的途径，包括举行中美外长会议在内，并且作出具体安排。”
    鉴于美国已经使用了武力和武力威胁侵占了中国领土台湾，中国方面认为，如果按照美方的意见，要把双方通过和平谈判解决两国之间的争端而不诉诸威胁或武力的原则具体地应用于台湾地区，也就有必要对于寻求和确定解决台湾地区紧张局势问题的途径作出明确的和不可推诿的规定。只有这样，才能使中美大使级会谈不致长期拖延，使台湾地区紧张局势的问题有获得解决的可能。因此，中国方面提出的草案规定，在声明发表后的两个月内，中美两国大使级会谈应该寻求和确定切实可行的途径，包括举行中美外长会议在内，并且作出具体的安排。
    中国方面坚决认为，如果美方具有和平解决中美两国在台湾地区的争端的任何诚意，那么，就没有任何理由继续拖延会谈，而不就中国方面的这一声明草案达成协议。全世界都渴望台湾地区的紧张局势能够消除，并且担心着由于中美大使级会谈长期不能达成协议而必然产生的后果，中国方面认为有必要把上述情况公之于世。
