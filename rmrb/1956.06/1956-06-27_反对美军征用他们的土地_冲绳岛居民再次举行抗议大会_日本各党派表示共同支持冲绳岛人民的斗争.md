Xinhua News Agency, June 26th -- Okinawa residents held another protest rally in Naha and Koza yesterday. In Naha, approximately 50,000 people participated in the rally. Representatives from all walks of life expressed their firm opposition to the U.S. seizure of their land and strongly called for the resolute defense of the four principles for resolving the land issue. The "four principles" were decided by the joint council composed of four organizations, including the Okinawa Civil Government and the Legislature. Its content is: opposition to long-term U.S. leases and one-time payment of rent; opposition to increased U.S. land seizures; return of unused land to residents; and increased rent and compensation for all losses.

The Okinawa All-Island Municipal Assembly Chairmen's Association issued a statement on the 21st, firmly supporting the "four principles." The Chairmen's Association stated: These four principles are the urgent wishes and minimum requirements for the survival of the people of Okinawa. The Chairmen's Association stated that it would promote the U.S. to reconsider its plans through a general resignation. The Chairmen's Association also requested the people of all countries in the world to give just and humanitarian support to the residents of Okinawa.

Xinhua News Agency, June 26th -- Tokyo News: The ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan decided today at its General Affairs Council meeting to support the struggle of Okinawa residents against the U.S. land seizure. The Liberal Democratic Party's executive body concluded that the claims of Okinawa residents are correct, and the Japanese government should support them and urge the U.S. government to reconsider its policy of seizing land in Okinawa to expand military bases. The General Affairs Council decided to submit these views to the government.

This afternoon, representatives of the Socialist Party met with Nobusuke Kishi, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, and suggested that the ruling and opposition parties unite to jointly study countermeasures regarding the Okinawa issue. Nobusuke Kishi expressed his willingness to cooperate with the Socialist Party.
