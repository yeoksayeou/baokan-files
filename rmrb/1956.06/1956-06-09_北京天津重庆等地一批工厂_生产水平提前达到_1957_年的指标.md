Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A batch of factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other places have already reached the 1957 production levels stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    In Beijing, twenty-nine state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories have reached the 1957 production level ahead of schedule. Workers in these factories have worked hard to learn from advanced experience during the advanced producer movement, greatly exceeding the original planned targets. At the local state-owned Guanghua Timber Factory, the main product—plywood—has seen a 78% increase in daily output and a 38.5% reduction in costs since the beginning of this year, due to the promotion of ten major advanced experiences from fraternal factories, without any increase in equipment or manpower. The leadership of the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Factory originally planned for the total output value of the entire factory to reach the 1957 production level fourteen months ahead of schedule. After discussions among the workers at the beginning of this year, this was revised to seventeen months ahead of schedule. Since the launch of the advanced producer movement, this factory had already reached the 1957 production level by May 31st.
    Currently, more than sixty industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing are working hard to reach the 1957 production level six months to one and a half years ahead of schedule.
    As of the end of May, twenty-three local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Tianjin had reached the 1957 production level ahead of schedule. These factories include wool and linen textile factories, steel rolling mills, chemical factories, mast lamp factories, electrolytic copper factories, machine factories, wire factories, vehicle fitting factories, wire factories, and electrical manufacturing factories.
    In the first three years and five months of the Five-Year Plan, these twenty-three factories produced a total of fifty-seven new products for the country.
    To date, among the forty-eight local state-owned and joint state-private factories under the Chongqing Municipal Industrial Bureau, twenty-four factories have reached the 1957 total output value targets ahead of schedule.
    These factories include the Chongqing Machine Iron Factory, Chongqing Fire Equipment Factory, Chongqing Stationery Factory, China Wool Textile Factory, Xinmin Brush Factory, Yaoyou Pharmaceutical Factory, Chongqing Auto Parts Factory, etc.; some of these factories have also reached the 1957 production levels.

    到目前为止，重庆市工业局所属的四十八个地方国营和公私合营工厂中，已经有二十四个厂提前达到了1957年的总产值指标。
    这些工厂有重庆机器铁工厂、重庆消防厂、重庆文具厂、中国毛纺织厂、新民制刷厂、药友制药厂、重庆汽车配件厂等；其中有些厂的产量，也达到了1957年的水平。
