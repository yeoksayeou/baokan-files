    Several Questions Regarding Wage System Reform
    Question: Why is it necessary to reform the wage system now?
    Answer: In the past few years, with the recovery and development of production and the reform of enterprise management systems, wage reforms and adjustments have been carried out in various regions across the country, which have greatly improved the lives of workers and also promoted the increase of labor productivity. However, the following two problems still exist in the current wage system:
    On the one hand, the growth rate of wages is not compatible with the increase rate of labor productivity. Judging from the implementation of the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, labor productivity has overfulfilled the plan every year, while the wage plan has not been completed every year. Although the wage level is gradually increasing, the wage increase in the material production sector is very slow.
    On the other hand, the wage system itself also has unreasonable phenomena such as egalitarianism and disunity. For example, there are too many and inconsistent standards in the wage grade system. Even in the same industry and enterprises of the same nature, there are twenty or thirty different wage standards. In many enterprises, the wage coefficient is inconsistent with the technical grade. Low-grade workers get more wage increases when they are promoted one grade, while high-grade workers get very little wage increases when they are promoted one grade; in many enterprises' wage standards, there is no distinction between piece-rate wages and time wages, and there is no clear distinction between wages for above-ground and underground work, high-temperature and normal-temperature work, and primary and secondary work; various bonus and subsidy standards, wage relations between various industries, regions, and personnel are also not entirely reasonable; in addition, the value of wage points is also too high or too low, which cannot accurately reflect the actual needs of workers' lives.
    This wage reform, on the one hand, is to correct some unreasonable phenomena in the past wage system; on the other hand, it is also to make the wage system suitable for the actual needs of economic development. This will further give play to the material incentive effect of wages on production, encourage the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, and continuously improve labor productivity to ensure the early completion and overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan.
    Question: What are the basic principles of wage system reform?
    Answer: The basic principles of this wage reform are: "to each according to his work" and gradually improve the lives of workers on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity.
    "To each according to his work" is the socialist principle of distribution. This wage reform clearly distinguishes between complex labor and simple labor, heavy labor and light labor in the wage standards. It stipulates higher wage standards for high-grade workers, senior specialized talents, major leaders and major engineering and technical personnel in enterprises, and also stipulates higher wage standards for piecework and high-temperature and underground work. In addition, according to the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and the needs of national construction, the wage standards of heavy industry departments have been increased more, and higher standards have also been stipulated for the wages in key construction areas in the inland. In this way, the principle of "to each according to his work" has been further implemented, and the confusion and unreasonable phenomena in the past wages have been overcome. And according to the principle of "to each according to his work," the wage relations between industries, regions, and types of workers are rationally stipulated.
    The increase in wages must also have a correct relationship with the development of production: on the one hand, the increase in wages must not exceed the increase in labor productivity, otherwise it will hinder the further development of production and violate the long-term interests of the country and the people; on the other hand, wages must be correspondingly increased with the development of production, because the purpose of our development of production is to continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. If we ignore this, it will affect the production enthusiasm of workers, which is also not in line with the long-term interests of the country and the people. According to the state regulations, the wage level of workers will be generally increased in this year's wage reform, and the wages of production workers will be increased more. This is the result of improving labor productivity. Therefore, our country's wage policy is a policy that closely combines wages and production, a policy that encourages workers to work actively, and a policy that improves production and improves the lives of workers. All our workers across the country should further give play to their labor enthusiasm and further improve labor productivity, so that not only can the national construction cause proceed faster, but the lives of workers can also be continuously improved.
    Question: What is the job-based wage system? Why is it necessary to implement the job-based wage system?
    Answer: The implementation of the job-based wage system for enterprise leaders, engineering and technical personnel, and staff members is one of the important contents of this wage reform and an important measure to further implement the principle of "to each according to his work." The job-based wage system means that various state-owned enterprise departments stipulate reasonable wage standards based on the importance and work situation of various positions, and taking into account the current actual wage situation. Currently, in state-owned enterprises, wages are generally stipulated according to the conditions of cadres and technical titles, and there is a phenomenon of wage decoupling from positions; in addition, the division of positions is very general, and there are many wage grades and small differences in the same type of position. For example, in many enterprises, the wage standards of workshop directors, section chiefs, and foreman are often lower than the wage standards of the workers they lead; engineering and technical personnel with the same technical title often have the same wages even though they hold different positions and work in different situations. In this wage reform, stipulating wages according to positions can change these unreasonable phenomena, so as to better give play to the enthusiasm of enterprise leaders, engineering and technical personnel, and staff members in improving their technical and professional levels and strengthening the responsibility of managing enterprises.
    Question: Why abolish wage points and implement a monetary wage system?
    Answer: The wage reform plan stipulates that workers' wages will no longer be calculated in wage points, but will be calculated directly in currency. We know that the wage point system was implemented in the early days of national liberation. At that time, the purpose was to prevent workers' wage income from being affected by price fluctuations. In the past few years, this system has indeed played a great role in ensuring the lives of the masses of workers and has also unified the wage calculation unit. However, with the development of the national economic construction cause, prices have long been stabilized nationwide, and wage points have lost their effect on ensuring the lives of workers; the living standards of workers have gradually improved, and the five kinds of physical objects (grain, cloth, oil, salt, and coal) included in the wage points can no longer fully reflect the actual needs of workers' lives; in economic planning management and economic accounting, finance, costs, etc. are all calculated in currency, only wages are calculated in "points," which is very inconvenient to calculate; in addition, the value of wage points varies greatly from place to place, and there are phenomena of being too high or too low, which increases the unreasonable wage differences between regions. Therefore, in this wage reform, it is necessary to abolish the outdated wage point system and replace it with a monetary wage system.

    关于改革工资制度的几个问题
    问：为什么现在要改革工资制度？
    答：几年以来，随着生产的恢复、发展和企业管理制度的改革，全国各地区都进行过工资改革和调整工资，使职工生活有了很大的改善，同时也促进了劳动生产率的提高。但是，目前工资制度中还存在着以下两个方面的问题：
    一方面是，工资增长的速度和劳动生产率的增加速度不相适应。从五年计划前三年的执行情况来看，劳动生产率年年超额完成了计划，而工资计划却每年都没有完成。工资水平虽然是逐步增长的，但是物资生产部门的工资增长得很慢。
    另一方面，工资制度本身也存在着平均主义和不统一等不合理现象。如工资等级制度中标准过多，互不一致，甚至在同一个产业、同一性质的企业中就有二、三十种不同的工资标准，许多企业里的工资系数和技术等级的差别不相符合，低等级工人升一级增加工资较多，而高等级工人升一级增加工资很少；在许多企业的工资标准中，计件工资同计时工资没有区别，井上同井下、高温同常温、主要工作同次要工作的工资也没有明显的区别；各种奖励、津贴标准，各产业、地区和人员之间的工资关系上也不尽合理；此外，工资分分值也有偏高偏低的现象，不能确切地反映职工生活的实际需要。
    这次工资改革，一方面是为了纠正过去工资制度中一些不合理的现象；另一方面也为了使工资制度能够适合经济发展的实际需要。这将进一步发挥工资对生产的物质鼓励作用，鼓舞广大职工群众的社会主义的积极性，不断地提高劳动生产率，以保证提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划。
    问：改革工资制度的基本原则是什么？
    答：这次工资改革的基本原则就是：按劳取酬，在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善职工的生活。
    按劳取酬是社会主义的分配原则。这次工资改革，在工资标准中把复杂劳动和简单劳动，繁重劳动和轻便劳动明确地区分开来，对于高等级工人、高级专门人材、企业中的主要领导人和主要工程技术人员等规定了较高的工资标准，对于计件工作和高温、井下等工作也规定了较高的工资标准，此外还根据优先发展重工业的方针和国家建设的需要，较多地提高了重工业部门的工资标准，对于内地重点建设地区的工资也规定了较高的标准。这样，就进一步贯彻了按劳取酬的原则，克服了过去工资中的混乱和不合理现象。并且根据按劳取酬的原则合理地规定了产业之间、地区之间和各类职工之间的工资关系。
    工资的提高还必须同生产的发展有正确的关系：一方面，工资的增加决不能超过劳动生产率的提高，否则就会妨碍生产的进一步发展，违反国家和人民的长远利益的；另一方面，又必须使工资随着生产的发展有相应的提高，因为我们发展生产的目的就是为了不断提高人民的物质和文化生活水平，如果忽视这一点，就会影响职工的生产积极性，也是不符合国家和人民的长远利益的。今年的工资改革，根据国家规定，职工的工资水平将普遍增加，其中生产工人的工资将有更多的增加。这就是提高劳动生产率的结果。因此，我们国家的工资政策是工资和生产密切结合的政策，是鼓励职工积极劳动的政策，是提高生产和改善职工生活的政策。我们全国职工应该进一步发挥劳动积极性，进一步提高劳动生产率，这样不但可使国家建设事业进行得更快，职工生活也能不断地得到改善。
    问：什么是职务工资制？为什么要实行职务工资制？
    答：在企业领导人员、工程技术人员和职员中实行职务工资制度，是这次工资改革的重要内容之一，是进一步贯彻按劳取酬原则的一项重要措施。职务工资制度，就是各国营企业部门根据各种职务的重要性和工作情况，并且照顾现在的实际工资状况，分别规定合理的工资标准。目前在国营企业里，一般都是按照干部条件和技术称号规定工资，工资和职务有脱节的现象；再加上职务划分得很笼统，同类职务的工资等级多、差别小。例如，在不少企业中，车间主任、工段长、工长等的工资标准，往往比他们所领导的工人的工资标准还低；同一技术称号的工程技术人员，虽然担任的职务不同，工作的情况不同，但是他们的工资却往往是一样的。在这次工资改革中，按照职务来规定工资，就可以改变目前这些不合理的现象，以便更好地发挥企业领导人员、工程技术人员和职员提高技术、业务水平的积极性和加强管理企业的责任心。
    问：为什么要废除工资分，实行货币工资制？
    答：工资改革方案中规定，职工的工资不再用工资分来计算，改为直接用货币来计算。我们知道，工资分制，是在全国解放初期开始实行的，当时的目的是为了不使职工的工资收入受到物价波动的影响。几年来，这种制度对于保障职工群众的生活的确起了很大的作用，同时也统一了工资计算单位。但是，随着国家经济建设事业的发展，目前在全国范围内，物价早已经稳定了，工资分也已经失去了对保障职工生活的作用；职工生活水平逐步提高了，工资分内所包含的粮、布、油、盐、煤五种实物已经不能够完全反映出职工生活的实际需要；在经济计划管理和经济核算中，财务、成本等都用货币来计算，只有工资是用“分”计算的，计算起来就很不方便；此外，各地工资分值很不一致，有偏高或偏低现象，就加大了地区之间不合理的工资差别。所以，在这次工资改革中，必须废除过时了的工资分制度，改用货币工资制。
