    庆祝中国印度尼西亚友协成立周年
    北京各界人士同印度尼西亚友人举行了愉快的晚会
    新华社1日讯　首都各界人士今天晚间同在京的许多印度尼西亚的朋友们一起，举行了一个愉快的晚会，庆祝中国印度尼西亚友好协会成立一周年。
    在这个有四百人参加的晚会上，中国印度尼西亚友好协会副会长胡愈之和印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆临时代办安瓦·萨尼都讲了话。他们用许多事例说明了一年来中国和印度尼西亚两国间友好关系的发展，并欢呼中国印度尼西亚友好万岁。当安瓦·萨尼代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理并遵照总理的指示祝贺中国印度尼西亚友好协会成立一周年的时候，全场的掌声经久不息。
    今天的庆祝晚会，就是在一年前的今天中国印度尼西亚友好协会成立的地方——新侨饭店的一座大厅里举行的。那时候，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和周恩来总理都出席了成立大会。
    正在北京访问的雅加达特别市市长苏迪罗和在京的许多印度尼西亚朋友出席今天的晚会，使晚会更加丰富多采。
    晚会进行得非常愉快。扩音器不断传送着悦耳的印度尼西亚歌曲。宾主们围聚在一起，一面吃着可口的印度尼西亚大使馆送来的印度尼西亚糕点，一面畅叙着两国友谊的发展。
    在晚会上，人们还欣赏了介绍印度尼西亚风光的彩色影片和两国总理互相访问的纪录片。银幕上一幕幕两国总理互相访问时的感人镜头，激起了人们关于两国友谊发展的美好回忆。
