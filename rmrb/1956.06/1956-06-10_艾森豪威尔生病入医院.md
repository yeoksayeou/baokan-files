Xinhua News Agency, June 9th dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower was admitted to Walter Reed Army Hospital yesterday due to ileitis.

According to a White House statement, Eisenhower was sent to the hospital only as a precautionary measure. His "blood pressure and pulse are good, and there are no signs of any heart disease developing."

The news of Eisenhower's illness triggered three waves of selling on the New York stock market, causing stock prices to plummet.

According to Reuters, Washington insiders are speculating about the Republican Party's chances of winning this November's presidential election because of Eisenhower's illness. It is expected that the Democratic Party will make the President's health a "more explosive campaign issue."
