    Striving to Advance Towards Science
    —Speech by Representative Zhang Yan
    I fully agree with the "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget" made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, the "Explanation on the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives" made by Minister Liao Luyan, and the "Work Report of the Standing Committee" made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am determined to strive to complete this great task.
    Fellow representatives, I recently visited Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Taiyuan, where I observed several agricultural production cooperatives and a few factories and mines. I focused mainly on public health and health institutions. I would like to report on my observations and the problems I found for your reference.
    In the old days, Zhangjiakou city had narrow streets, garbage piled up everywhere, and whenever a strong wind blew in spring, it became smoggy and dusty. When the weather got warmer, flies and mosquitoes swarmed, hindering traffic; lice and bedbugs hid and spread, disturbing sleep, and as a result, various infectious diseases developed periodically. In addition, rats roamed the fields and sparrows flew everywhere, causing serious damage to crops.
    Since liberation, in just a few short years, the country has made great achievements in all aspects. Especially after the call to eliminate the four pests, Zhangjiakou city and Zhangjiakou Special District have made remarkable and astonishing achievements. From January to April of this year, the urban area eliminated 67,540 rats and 147,946 sparrows, and dug up 13,844 catties of pupae. Zhang Special District captured 657,650 rats, poisoned 5,683,200 field mice, and eliminated 1,050,000 sparrows; therefore, the bumper harvest of agricultural products in the area is partly due to the elimination of rats and sparrows. In addition, cholera has disappeared, and infectious diseases such as dysentery, plague, and typhus have also been greatly reduced.
    Zhangjiakou city is most outstanding in its public health work. They have a street sanitation committee, and the cleaning system is well implemented. Every household uses 666 to paint the walls once a month, which thoroughly disinfects the rooms and eradicates bedbugs. Therefore, in the residential areas, whether indoors, outdoors, in the courtyards, or in the streets, everything is orderly and very clean. These obvious achievements would be difficult to achieve without the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the united and selfless labor of the people.
    Regarding the issue of endemic diseases, the most serious is osteomalacia (or chondromalacia). This disease is more common in women, and it is easy to see in the Zhangjiakou area and near the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi Province. Many women in those areas have difficult labor. The cause of osteomalacia is mainly habitual malnutrition, which leads to a lack of calcium in the bones, resulting in conditions such as bowlegs, oblique pelvis, pigeon chest, and hunchback. I believe that if we strengthen the education of the masses on scientific knowledge, we can change the old bad habits and improve the health of the people.
    The lack of medical personnel is a common phenomenon in the rapid development of our country's first five-year plan. In terms of medical and epidemic prevention, Zhangjiakou city urgently needs to add a large number of doctors and nurses. Datong city urgently needs to supplement 200 formal doctors due to the newly built and expanded 350 beds this year, together with a total shortage of 1,000 intermediate medical officers and nurses. Shanxi Medical College also feels a great shortage of teaching staff (especially clinical staff) due to the gradual increase in enrollment. Taiyuan city is a modern industrial city with a population of 830,000, but currently lacks specialized hospitals, with only a 115-bed maternity and child health hospital responsible for treating maternal and infant diseases and midwifery; therefore, it is also necessary to quickly organize the establishment of a children's hospital and a maternity hospital. Therefore, in the future, we should actively train a large number of medical cadres, uniformly grasp the supplementary allocation, and give appropriate consideration according to the specific conditions of various places, to solve the current urgent need for personnel.
    Fellow representatives: In order to respond to the call for "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," please allow me to talk about some of the problems existing in the great march towards science and the development of scientific research.
    Scientific research is an indispensable and important task to promote the development of construction undertakings and improve the quality of teaching. This view has been clearly pointed out in the speech of Minister Yang Xiufeng of the Ministry of Higher Education. We believe that our research work will soon have brilliant achievements under the correct leadership and support of the Party and the government. However, in the process of vigorously carrying out scientific research, we must take careful plans and appropriate measures to avoid impetuousness and rashness, eliminate duplication and contradictions, strengthen foreign language learning, supplement references, and ensure steady progress on the basis of a certain quality.
    In the process of natural science research, a complete set of professional journals and related books is indispensable. Several representatives have pointed out the need to reprint old Chinese and foreign language magazines, which is indeed a matter that needs to be done urgently at present. If this cannot be done, it will affect the formal research of science and technology, making it difficult to improve oneself, and also making it difficult to approach or reach the world's advanced level. Of course, reprinting complete sets of documents in various subjects will consume a lot of funds, and it is not something that can be done in an instant, but we must make such a plan, distinguishing between the important and the urgent, and proceed step by step, and after a considerable period of time, there will always be a day when it is all completed. Therefore, I hope that the responsible comrades of the relevant leading departments will care for and support the above-mentioned measures so as to resolve the contradictory problems existing in the research work as soon as possible.
    It is undeniable that the foundation of primary and secondary school education in our country is very poor, especially the foreign language level is too low. There are no foreign language regulations in the primary school curriculum, and middle school students generally recognize that foreign language learning is one of the subsidiary subjects, so the teaching is not strict, the learning is not effective, and they muddle along. As a result, the foreign language foundation of a high school graduate is naturally very poor, and when they enter university, due to the heavy professional courses, the foreign language they have learned not only cannot be improved, but also tends to be forgotten day by day, so such university graduates do not have sound abilities in research work. Vice Chairman Guo Moruo pointed out in his speech that "striving to cultivate new forces" is very necessary. However, cultivating new forces must have a good foundation, especially a foreign language foundation. Therefore, it is recommended that foreign languages should be listed as one of the main subjects in both junior and senior high schools, and teachers who teach this language must also conscientiously and responsibly perform the teaching tasks. When universities recruit new students, all students applying for natural sciences must also participate in foreign language tests. In this way, young students will lay a good foreign language foundation in middle school, which will be of great help to them in participating in research work after graduation from university. Therefore, to strengthen and strive to cultivate new forces must start from middle school, because it is the main link in the entire academic process, and the learning of all basic courses must be firmly cultivated in this important process; this point is indeed not to be ignored.
    In short, if we want to vigorously advance towards science and strive to make our research work approach or reach the world's advanced level within twelve years, we must supplement books, add equipment, lay a good foreign language foundation, and strengthen the study of dialectical materialism and Marxism-Leninism, give play to initiative and creativity; in this way, we can not only develop scientific research to meet the needs of all aspects, but also contribute greater strength to the country's socialist construction cause.

    努力向科学进军
    ——张岩代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理所作的“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，廖鲁言部长所作的“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”和彭真副委员长所作的“常务委员会的工作报告”，并决心为完成这种伟大的任务而奋斗。
    各位代表，最近我曾到了张家口、大同和太原等地，看了几个农业生产合作社和少数的工矿，重点的是在公共卫生和卫生机构方面看的比较多些。我愿意将这次视察的情况和发现的问题择要地汇报出来，供各位代表参考。
    旧日的张家口市街衢狭窄，垃圾载道，每逢春季狂风一起，就乌烟瘴气，灰尘蔽天；到了气候稍暖，苍蝇蚊子蜂拥云集，阻碍交通，虱子臭虫隐匿散布，扰人安眠，因而各种传染疾病就有了定期性的发展。再加老鼠遍野，麻雀横飞，农田作物也遭到严重的损害。
    自从解放以来只不过是短短的几年，国家在各个方面都取得了伟大的成绩。特别是在除四害号召以后，张家口市和张家口专区就作出了显著惊人的成绩。市区自本年一月至四月曾消灭老鼠67，540只，麻雀147，946个，挖蛹13，844斤。张专捕鼠657，650只，毒死野鼠5，683，200只，消灭麻雀1，050，000个；因此该地区的农产丰收，捕灭鼠雀是原因之一。此外霍乱绝迹，痢疾、鼠疫和斑疹伤寒等传染疾病也都是大大地减少了。
    张家口市最突出的是公共卫生工作，他们有街道卫生委员会，清洁制度执行得很好；家家户户每月都用六六六涂刷墙壁一次，这样就彻底地消毒了住室，根绝了臭虫。所以在住宅区无论是室内，户外，庭院和街巷也都是井然有序，洁净非常。这些显然的成就若不在中国共产党正确英明的领导和人民群众一致忘我的劳动下是很难实现的。
    关于地方病的问题，最严重的是骨软化病（或软骨病），这种疾病多见于妇女，在张家口地区及山西省太行山区附近都容易看见这一种疾病，那些地区的产妇难产的很多。骨软化病发生的原因，主要是习惯性的营养不良，致使骨胳缺乏钙质，出现了罗圈腿、斜骨盆、鸡胸、驼背等病状。我认为如果对群众加强科学知识的教育，就能够改变旧有的不好的习惯，就能够增进人民的健康。
    医务人员的缺乏是我国第一个五年计划迅速发展过程中存在的一个普遍现象。张家口市在医疗防疫方面，迫切要求增添大批医师和护士。大同市由于今年新建和扩建床位350张，急待补充正式医师200名，连同中级医士及护士等共欠1，000名，山西医学院因为招生任务渐次加大，也感到教学人员（特别是临床的）非常缺乏。太原市是现代化的工业城市，人口已经达到83万，但目前还缺少专业医院，仅有115张床位的妇幼保健院负责治疗妇婴疾病和接生工作；因此儿童医院和产院也有迅速组织成立的必要。所以今后应积极地培养大批医务干部，统一掌握补充调配，按各地具体情况，给予适当照顾，以解决当前迫切需人的困难问题。
    各位代表：为了响应“百家争鸣”的号召，请允许我谈一谈向科学大进军和发展科学研究工作中存在的一些问题。
    科学研究是为了促进建设事业的发展，提高教学质量所必不可缺少的重要工作，这种见解在高等教育部杨秀峰部长的发言中已经明确地指出过。我们相信我们的研究工作在党和政府的正确领导支持下，不久定会有光辉灿烂的成绩表现出来。但是在大力开展科学研究的过程中，必须采取周密的计划和适当的措施，避免急躁冒进，消除重复和矛盾，加强外文学习，补充参考文献，要保证在一定质量的基础上稳步前进。
    在自然科学研究工作进行中是离不开整套专业杂志和有关图书的。关于翻印中外文旧杂志的要求已有几位代表曾经指出，这的确是当前迫切要办的事情。倘不能办到这点，就影响科学技术正规的研究，这样既不易提高自己，也不易接近或达到世界先进水平。自然，进行翻印各科整套文献是要消费大量资金的，而且也不是转瞬可以办到的事情，但是我们要作出这种计划来，分别轻重缓急，按步骤依次进行，经过相当的时间后，总有全部完成的一日的。所以，我希望有关领导部门的负责同志们对上述措施加以关怀和支持，以求在研究工作中存在的矛盾问题早日解除。
    我国中小学教育基础很差，尤其外文程度太低是无可讳言的。现在小学课程中是根本没有外文的规定的，而中学学生一般又认定外文的学习是附属课目之一，因此就教之不严，学也不力，马马虎虎，彼此支吾而已。结果一个高中毕业生的外文基础自然很差，及至投入大学由于专业课程的繁重，所学外文不仅不能提高，反而有日渐遗忘的趋势，所以这样的大学毕业生在研究工作上是没有健全的能力的。郭沫若副委员长在他的发言中曾经指出“努力培养新生力量”，这是非常必要的。但是培养新生力量必须具有良好的基础，特别是外文基础。所以建议在初中和高中都应将外国语列为主要课目之一，担任这种语文的教师也必须认真负责地执行教学的任务。在大学招收新生的时候，凡投考自然科学的学生也必须参加外文的测验。这样一来使青年学生在中学中就打下了外文的良好基础，将来大学毕业后在参加研究工作上是有很大帮助的。所以加强并努力培养新生力量，则必自中学始，因为它是整个学程中主要的一环，一切基础课程的学习，都必须踏实地修养在这一个重要的过程中；这一点确是不可忽视的事情。
    总之，我们要大力向科学进军，争取在十二年内使我们的研究工作接近或达到世界先进水平，就必须补充图书，添置设备，打下良好外文基础，并加强辩证唯物主义和马克思列宁主义的学习，发挥积极性和创造性；这样，不但可以发展科学研究工作适应各方面的需要，并且也可以对国家的社会主义建设事业贡献出更大的力量。
