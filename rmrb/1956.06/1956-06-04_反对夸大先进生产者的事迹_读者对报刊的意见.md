    Opposing the Exaggeration of Advanced Producers' Deeds
    -- Readers' Opinions on Newspapers
    Reader Nan Fang writes: Everyone loves to read articles introducing the deeds of advanced producers, and often treats such articles as their own learning materials. Therefore, newspapers must be factual and truthful when introducing the deeds of advanced producers, and there must be no exaggeration or inaccuracy. However, in recent days, the reports in the New Suzhou Daily, Jiangsu Xinhua Daily, and Shanghai Youth Daily about the deeds of advanced producer Wang Zushi have made the mistake of exaggeration and inaccuracy.
    Wang Zushi is a young embroidery expert and the deputy director of the Suzhou Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Arts and Crafts Embroidery Cooperative. She has successively collaborated with Li Eying and Cui Wencui to embroider two peony hanging screens and one colored bird hanging screen with high technical requirements, and these works have been exhibited abroad. Because she can humbly learn from older workers with higher skills, she has made rapid progress. In February of this year, she was selected as a representative to attend the Jiangsu Socialist Construction Advanced Producers Representative Conference, and was rated as a first-class advanced producer at the conference. If the newspaper reports her advanced deeds truthfully, it can inspire and educate readers. However, the New Suzhou Daily and others exaggerated her deeds, which aroused dissatisfaction among readers.
    When introducing Wang Zushi's deeds, the New Suzhou Daily said that in 1954-1955, she successively embroidered six-color scarves, peace doves, colored birds, peony hanging screens, and other works for exhibition abroad, which won praise from international friends. A communication in the Xinhua Daily on March 6 reported: "In the most recent year or so, she has had eight works, including peace doves, colored birds, and peony flower hanging screens, exhibited at international exhibitions held in the Soviet Union, East Germany, and countries such as England and France," and also said: "Wang Zushi... not only restored the long-lost double-sided embroidery, but also creatively used double-sided embroidery to embroider colorful flowers and birds." An article in the Shanghai Youth Daily on March 9 entitled "A Clever Mind, Skillful Hands" also exaggerated Wang Zushi's deeds, saying: The "glorious and arduous trial embroidery task" of embroidering the peony hanging screen was "entrusted to the nineteen-year-old young embroidery expert Wang Zushi," and "after more than a month of painstaking research, the work was finally embroidered."
    After seeing the newspaper, the members of the Suzhou Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Arts and Crafts Embroidery Cooperative believed that Wang Zushi had taken credit for the achievements of others. The Suzhou Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China had to intervene in this matter and try to find a way to eliminate the adverse effects caused by the untrue reports.
    Why does this phenomenon of exaggeration and inaccuracy occur? This is because the newspapers lack in-depth interviewing style and a realistic work attitude. Before the Jiangsu Provincial Advanced Producers Representative Conference was held, several staff members of the Suzhou Municipal Handicraft Industry Union and other units successively compiled three pieces of materials introducing Wang Zushi's deeds. They did not conduct in-depth understanding when collecting materials, and did not discuss and verify after sorting them out, so that all the achievements of the three people's cooperation were attributed to Wang Zushi alone. And these three newspapers blindly believed it, wrote reports based on these materials, and did not check after writing. Although the reporters of Xinhua Daily and Shanghai Youth Daily talked with Wang Zushi herself, they did not find more people to understand the situation. And the exaggerations were not Wang Zushi's remarks. The staff of the Suzhou delegation pointed out to the reporter of Shanghai Youth Daily that the draft communication was overly exaggerated, but the Youth Daily only made very small changes in two places before publishing it.
    Now newspapers everywhere are using great efforts to report on the advanced producer movement. I think that not only should the New Suzhou Daily and other three newspapers be vigilant and prevent the recurrence of such exaggerated and inaccurate reports, but other newspapers can also learn a useful lesson from this matter.

### 反对夸大先进生产者的事迹——读者对报刊的意见

    反对夸大先进生产者的事迹
    ——读者对报刊的意见
    读者南方来信：人人爱读介绍先进生产者事迹的文章，而且常常把这类文章当作自己的学习材料。因此报纸在介绍先进生产者事迹的时候，必须实事求是，绝不能有丝毫的夸大和失实。可是前些日子，新苏州报、江苏新华日报和上海青年报关于先进生产者王祖识事迹的报道，恰恰犯了夸大和失实的毛病。
    王祖识是一个青年刺绣能手，是苏州市文联工艺美术刺绣合作社的副主任。她曾先后同李娥英、崔文萃合刺了技术要求很高的两幅牡丹挂屏和一幅彩鸟挂屏，这些作品曾经出国展览。由于她能虚心向技术较高的老工人学习，进步较快，今年二月被评选为出席江苏社会主义建设先进生产者代表会议的代表，在会上并被评为一等先进生产者。报纸如实地把她的先进事迹报道出来，是可以鼓舞和教育读者的。但是新苏州报等却把她的事迹加以夸大，引起了读者的不满。
    新苏州报在介绍王祖识事迹的时候，说她在1954—1955年先后绣了六色围巾、和平鸽、彩鸟、牡丹等挂屏等作品出国展览，获得国际友人的好评。新华日报三月六日的一篇通讯中报道说：“她在最近的一年多时间里，就已有和平鸽、彩色鸟、牡丹花挂屏等八件作品，先后在苏联、民主德国以及英、法等国家举行的国际展览会上展览过，”又说：“王祖识……不仅恢复了失传已久的双面绣，而且创造性地用双面绣绣出五彩缤纷的花卉和飞鸟。”上海青年报三月九日一篇题为“聪明的心，灵巧的手”的通讯中，也夸大王祖识的事迹说：刺绣牡丹挂屏的“这个光荣而又艰巨的试绣任务交给了十九岁的青年刺绣能手王祖识”，“经过一个多月的苦心研究，作品终于绣成了。”
    苏州市文联工艺美术刺绣合作社的社员看到报纸后，认为是王祖识夺去了别人的成绩。中共苏州市委因此也不得不干预这件事情，想出办法来消除不真实报道所引起的不良影响。
    为什么会产生这种夸大失实的现象呢？这是因为报纸缺乏深入的采访作风和实事求是的工作态度。在江苏省召开先进生产者代表会议以前，苏州市手工业工会等单位的几个工作人员先后整理了三份介绍王祖识事迹的材料。他们收集材料的时候没有深入了解，整理之后又没有讨论核实，以致把三人合作的成绩，统统归之于王祖识一人。而这三个报纸就轻信不疑，根据这些材料写出了报道，写成后又不进行核对。新华日报和上海青年报的记者虽然同王祖识本人谈了话，但没有找更多的人进行了解。而夸大之处也都不是王祖识的谈话。苏州市代表团的工作人员向上海青年报的记者指出通讯稿有过分夸大的地方，青年报却只在两处作了很小的修改，就发表了。
    现在各地报纸都在用很大的力量报道先进生产者运动。我认为，不仅新苏州报等三个报纸应当警惕起来，防止再发生这种夸大失实的报道，其他报纸也可从这件事情得到一次有益的教训。
