Xinhua News Agency, June 14th. The representatives to the Fourth Enlarged Meeting on Overseas Chinese Affairs enthusiastically discussed overseas Chinese affairs work at the plenary sessions from the 11th to the 14th. Fifty-four representatives spoke at the meeting, and thirty others submitted written opinions.

In their speeches, the representatives expressed their gratitude to the Communist Party and the government for their care for overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese, and expressed their determination to strive to expand the unity of overseas Chinese and promote the patriotic spirit of overseas Chinese. Chen Jiageng, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, spoke at the meeting today, calling on overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to maintain and promote their love for the motherland and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Xu Simin, a representative to the National People's Congress who returned from Burma to attend the meeting, spoke at the plenary session on the 13th on the issue of expanding the unity of overseas Chinese. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai's report on January 30 this year opened up a broad path for Kuomintang members abroad. We must carefully understand the spirit of Premier Zhou's report, warmly extend our hands, and express our magnanimity and non-pursuit of the past. This will have a great effect on the great unity of overseas Chinese abroad.

Many representatives spoke with great interest about the issue of guiding overseas Chinese to return to China to invest. Huang Changshui and five other representatives believe that reclaiming barren mountains and wastelands in overseas Chinese hometowns and planting subtropical plants is what overseas Chinese welcome most. Zhuang Mingli, member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, focused on the issue of overseas Chinese developing reclamation projects in Hainan Island in his speech. He said that Hainan Island has a history of planting rubber for more than 40 years. Whether from the needs of the country or from the unique experience of overseas Chinese in planting rubber, guiding overseas Chinese to develop Hainan Island will be very meaningful.

You Yangzu, Vice Governor of Fujian Province and member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made a speech on issues such as increasing the income of relatives of overseas Chinese and the direction of overseas Chinese investment. He suggested that agricultural production cooperatives in overseas Chinese hometowns should establish more sideline businesses suitable for their labor conditions according to the specific circumstances of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, which would be beneficial to increasing the income of relatives of overseas Chinese and developing production. He believes that the direction of overseas Chinese investment is mainly in industrial and agricultural construction.

The representatives also put forward suggestions for improving overseas Chinese affairs work in their speeches.

This morning, the presidium of the conference also rewarded Liu Weisheng, Lin Caiyun, and 33 other returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese who attended the conference, all of whom are labor models and advanced workers in various production and work posts.

    新华社14日讯　第四次侨务扩大会议十一日到十四日的大会上，代表们热烈地讨论了侨务工作。会上有五十四位代表作了发言，另外有三十位代表提出了书面意见。
    代表们在发言中感谢共产党和政府对华侨、归侨和侨眷的关怀，表示要努力扩大华侨的团结和发扬华侨爱国的精神。全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、华侨事务委员会委员陈嘉庚今天在大会上发言时，号召华侨和归侨保持和发扬热爱祖国的精神，努力参加祖国的社会主义建设。从缅甸回国参加会议的全国人民代表大会代表徐四民在十三日的大会上谈到有关扩大侨胞团结的问题。他说，周恩来总理今年一月三十日的报告给国外的国民党分子开辟了一条宽阔的道路。我们要好好地体会周总理报告的精神，热情地把我们的手伸出去，表示我们的宽大和不究既往，这样，对国外侨胞的大团结是会收到很大的效果的。
    许多代表以很大的兴趣谈到关于辅导华侨回国投资的问题。黄长水等五位代表认为在侨乡地区开垦荒山、荒地，种植亚热带植物，是华侨最欢迎的事。华侨事务委员会委员庄明理在发言中着重谈到华侨在海南岛发展垦殖事业的问题，他说，海南岛种植橡胶已经有四十多年的历史。无论从国家的需要和华侨对种植橡胶的独特经验来看，辅导华侨开发海南岛都将是很有意义的。
    福建省副省长、中国人民政协全国委员会委员尤扬祖就增加侨眷收入和华侨投资的方向等问题作了发言。他建议侨乡的农业生产合作社根据侨眷、归侨的具体情况，多创办一些适合他们劳动条件的副业，这对增加侨眷收入和发展生产都有好处。他认为华侨投资的方向主要是工业和农业建设。
    代表们在发言中还对侨务工作提出了改进的意见。
    今天上午，大会主席团还奖励了刘慰声、林彩云等出席大会的三十五位归侨和侨眷，他们都是各个生产和工作岗位上的劳动模范和先进工作者。
