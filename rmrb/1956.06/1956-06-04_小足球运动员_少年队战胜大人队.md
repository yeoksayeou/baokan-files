    On June 1st, at the Lüda City Primary School Student Sports Meet, the Lüda City Junior Football Team, which won the Liaoning Province Ten City Junior Football Championship, held a football exhibition match with the Dalian Cement Factory's employee football team. As a result of the match, the Lüda junior team won by a score of five to one.
    The Dalian Cement Factory's employee football team is currently the football champion of the heavy industry system in Lüda City. A few minutes after the start of the game, the junior team had already taken the offensive, and the ball was being kicked back and forth on the opponent's field. Before the opponent's goalkeeper had time to react, a junior team player had quickly kicked the ball into the opponent's goal. At the end of the first half, the junior team was leading three to one. In the second half of the game, the junior team scored two more goals, and the opponent never had a chance to shoot.
    The members of the Lüda City Junior Football Team are students from eight junior high schools and primary schools in Lüda City. The oldest is only seventeen years old, and the youngest is fourteen years old.

    大连水泥厂的职工足球队是目前旅大市重工业系统的足球冠军。比赛开始后几分钟，少年队已经采取了攻势，球一直在对方的球场上被踢得来回转，当对方的守门员还没有来得及注意的时候，一个少年队队员已经迅速地把球踢入了对方的球门，在上半场结束时，少年队以三比一领先。下半场比赛，少年队又进了两个球，对方始终没有得到射门的机会。
    旅大市少年足球队的队员是旅大市八个初级中学和小学的学生，最大的只有十七岁，最小的是十四岁。
