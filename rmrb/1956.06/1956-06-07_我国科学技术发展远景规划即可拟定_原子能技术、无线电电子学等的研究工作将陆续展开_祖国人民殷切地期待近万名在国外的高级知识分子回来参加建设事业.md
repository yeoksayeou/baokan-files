Xinhua News Agency, June 6th—Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters today on the Twelve-Year Science and Technology Development Plan and the issue of scientific and technological personnel. He also expressed a warm welcome to Chinese scientists, engineers, and students currently in the United States, Britain, France, Japan, and other countries to return to the motherland and participate in construction.

Guo Moruo said that the drafting of the Twelve-Year Science and Technology Development Plan, which began last December, will be basically completed within June. This is a grand charter for the development of Chinese science and technology, and it concentrates the wisdom of outstanding scientists from across the country and from the Soviet Union. According to this plan, research work in many of the most important and urgently needed disciplines, such as atomic energy technology, radio electronics, automation, electronic computers, and semiconductors, will be gradually carried out in China. It can be believed that with the diligent efforts of scientists across the country, the selfless assistance of scientists from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and the cooperation of the progressive scientific community worldwide, we will certainly be able to successfully complete the tasks stipulated in this long-term plan.

Guo Moruo said that the motherland is in an era of rapid development, an era of marching towards modern science, and needs an army of millions of scientific and technological personnel. The number of scientific and technological personnel left over from old China is too small. Although the growth of new forces in the six years since the founding of the country has been extremely rapid, it still lags far behind actual needs, and the lack of senior scientific and technological personnel in particular has become one of the most pressing issues at present.

Guo Moruo said that nearly ten thousand Chinese scientists and students working and studying in the United States, Britain, France, Japan, and other countries are a valuable asset of the motherland, and the vast majority of them already have considerable advanced expertise. More than one thousand people who have returned to the country in the past six years have been exerting their strength in scientific research, industrial construction, agricultural construction, and cultural education, and have been valued by the country and the people. The motherland warmly welcomes and eagerly awaits these nearly ten thousand senior intellectuals to return to the motherland as soon as possible, and use their expertise and skills to participate in the vigorously developing and increasingly large-scale construction of the motherland.

    我国科学技术发展远景规划即可拟定
    原子能技术、无线电电子学等的研究工作将陆续展开
    祖国人民殷切地期待近万名在国外的高级知识分子回来参加建设事业
    新华社6日讯　中国科学院院长郭沫若今天就十二年科学技术发展远景规划和科学技术人才问题向新华社记者发表谈话，他并且表示热烈欢迎目前还在美国、英国、法国、日本等国的中国科学家、工程师和留学生们回到祖国参加建设。
    郭沫若说，从去年十二月开始的中国科学技术发展十二年远景规划的拟制工作，在六月份内就要基本上完成了。这是一部发展中国科学技术的大宪章，它集中了全国优秀的科学家们和苏联科学家们的智慧。根据这个规划，许多最重要和急需的学科，如原子能技术、无线电电子学、自动化、电子计算机和半导体等方面的研究工作，都将在中国陆续开展起来。可以相信，在全国科学家的辛勤努力下，在苏联和各人民民主国家科学家们的无私援助下，在全世界进步科学界的协助下，我们一定能够胜利地完成这个长远规划所规定的任务。
    郭沫若说，祖国正处在一个飞跃发展的时代，一个向现代科学大进军的时代，需要一支数以百万计的科学技术大军。旧中国遗留下的科学技术人才是太少了。建国六年来新生力量的增长虽然极其迅速，但是仍然远远落后于实际的需要，特别是高级科学技术人才的缺乏，已经成为当前最迫切的问题之一。
    郭沫若说，近万的在美国、英国、法国、日本等国工作和学习的中国科学家和留学生，是祖国一部分宝贵的财产，他们绝大多数已有相当高级的专门知识。过去六年多来已经先后回国的一千余人，现在都在科学研究、工业建设、农业建设和文化教育等岗位上发挥着自己的力量，受到国家和人民的重视。祖国热烈地欢迎并且殷切地期待这将近一万的高级知识分子能尽早回到祖国，用自己的专门知识和技能，参加祖国蓬勃发展着的、规模越来越大的建设事业。
