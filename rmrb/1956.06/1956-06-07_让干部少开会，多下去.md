    Let Cadres Reduce Meetings and Go Down More Often
    In the high tide of socialism, new problems are constantly emerging, requiring timely solutions; the difficulties encountered by lower-level organizations in their work are also increasing, requiring assistance and guidance to overcome them. Lower-level organizations urgently demand that leading organs make their work more specific and in-depth. However, we hear everywhere that cadres are complaining about too much work, not enough time, and an inability to "go deep." Where has the time gone? A large part of it is taken up by all sorts of excessive, unnecessary, or poorly organized meetings.
    Taking the county-level organs in Laiwu County, Shandong Province, as an example, the county held a total of 22 meetings of various sizes in March. Of the 19 members of the county party committee, 14 spent the entire month presiding over and attending meetings. In the 31 days, each county party committee member spent an average of 29 and a half days in meetings, accounting for 95% of their total working time. According to the inspection by the Tai'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the situation of excessive meetings in other counties in the Tai'an Prefecture was basically similar to that in Laiwu County.
    The situation of excessive meetings exists not only in rural areas but also in the enterprise system. For example, the Party Committee Secretary of Shenyang Transformer Factory spent 11 and a half days in meetings from February 16th to March 2nd, a total of 15 days, including seven days attending meetings of various departments at higher levels. Even so, they were unable to attend some meetings convened by higher authorities.
    Excessive meetings directly affect the higher-level organs from conducting in-depth and specific leadership, and also directly affect the normal work of lower-level organs and grass-roots organizations. Take Zheng Sigong, the director, and Liang Shisheng, the deputy director, of the Huaibei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suixi County, Anhui Province, for example. They have been in meetings for the past 90 days since the beginning of spring. From attending provincial, prefectural, and county meetings to attending district meetings, from attending labor model meetings, rectification meetings, and agricultural technology meetings to attending water conservancy meetings, public security meetings, and transportation meetings, sometimes two people are summoned to attend the same meeting at the same time, taking up most of their working time. Director Zheng Sigong sometimes had to attend meetings in the county during the day and rush back to the cooperative, 14 li away, in the evening to study production issues.
    Thus, an abnormal situation has arisen: higher-level organs require lower-level organs to strengthen in-depth and specific leadership, but the leading cadres of lower-level organs are entangled in meetings convened and arranged by higher-level organs, leaving them no time to go deep. Lower-level organs also require higher-level organs to provide more specific assistance and guidance, and higher-level organs are also calling for going deep, but they are also held back by the excessive meetings they have arranged and often cannot leave the office.
    Meetings are an important form of collective discussion and problem-solving, and necessary meetings are indispensable. The problem is that there should not be too many meetings. How to solve the problem of excessive meetings? This requires higher leading organs to strictly control and comprehensively plan the meetings they want to convene and the meetings they want lower levels to convene. The key to making meetings fewer, shorter, better prepared, and more capable of solving problems lies in higher leading organs doing more in-depth and specific work, convening fewer lower-level cadres to attend meetings, and arranging fewer meetings for lower-level organs. Otherwise, lower-level party organizations cannot control or plan for many meetings. Taking Laiwu County as an example again, of the 22 meetings convened in March, 12 were arranged by various departments at higher levels to be convened within a limited time. May I ask, how can Laiwu County control and plan for so many meetings? How can Laiwu County have enough time to prepare fully if it has to hold all 12 meetings well?
    All leading organs should think more about the difficulties of lower-level cadres and more about the actual effect of work. They should understand the principle of "thousands of threads above, a single needle below." Do not just assign tasks to lower levels without understanding whether lower levels can complete the tasks or helping lower levels complete the tasks. Do not just ask lower-level cadres to go deep while you always remain high above, without giving lower-level cadres time to go deep. Understanding the difficulties of lower-level cadres, listening to the demands of lower-level cadres, and regularly and specifically helping and guiding lower-level cadres to do their work well is a fine tradition of our Party's leadership style. Leaders should carry forward this tradition and strive to go deep into the grassroots and get close to the masses.
    Leading cadres of leading organs going deep into the grassroots can not only understand the situation and inspect the work, but also convey some instructions and arrange some work at the grassroots level. Specifically guiding lower-level cadres to implement instructions, arranging work, and effectively helping lower-level cadres solve problems and summarize experiences can not only reduce meetings at the top but also reduce meetings at the bottom; it can not only enable leaders to learn this important method of conducting specific leadership but also effectively help cadres below overcome a generalized leadership style. The approach of "fewer meetings, more going down" adopted by the leadership of Harbin Flax Textile Factory is a successful example. Before the end of March this year, from the factory's leaders to the branch and workshop leaders were entangled in excessive meetings and unable to go deep. From the end of March, the factory leadership first implemented a system of controlling meetings and a system of daily inspections of the workshops. As a result, the situation quickly changed. Meetings from the factory to the workshops began to decrease, and specific assistance to lower-level cadres was strengthened. The leadership was also able to timely discover and solve specific problems and timely summarize and disseminate advanced experiences. And the leadership style of the branch and workshop, under the demonstration and help of the factory's leaders, also began to change.
    Of course, streamlining meetings and going deep into the grassroots is a major issue, which will inevitably encounter many difficulties and must go through some struggles. Some leading personnel have very serious bureaucratic habits, and they do not think that squatting in the office year after year is being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses. There are also some leading personnel who understand that they should not just squat in the office and should go deep, but they never go deep. Why? Because going deep into reality to carry out work is indeed more difficult than issuing orders from high above, and they do not have the determination to overcome difficulties. The Suiping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan, in order to change the situation where most leading personnel do not often go to the countryside and individual leading personnel never go to the countryside, has formulated a comprehensive plan for 11 county committee members and two deputy ministers to go to the countryside, and has determined the dates and times for each person to go to the countryside. The Tai'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong, in addition to determining the principle of streamlining meetings, has also made specific plans for leading personnel at all levels to go deep into the grassroots work; it stipulates that the time for going deep into the grassroots work is three months per year for the leading personnel of the prefecture, four months per year for the leading personnel of the county, and eight months per year for the district cadres. This approach is worthy of promotion, and this determination is also worthy of learning.

### 让干部少开会，多下去

    让干部少开会，多下去
    在社会主义高潮中，新问题不断发生，需要及时解决；下级组织在工作中碰到的困难也日益增加，需要帮助和指导他们克服。下级组织迫切要求领导机关把工作做得更具体、更深入。可是，我们却到处听到干部在喊工作太多，时间不够，“深入不下去”。时间哪里去了呢？很大一部分是被各种各样过多的、不必要的或者是组织得不好的会议占去了。
    以山东莱芜县级机关为例，这个县三月份共开了二十二次大小会议，十九个县委委员中，有十四个整整一个月都在主持会议和参加会议。在三十一天中，平均每个县委委员就有二十九天半在开会，占了全部工作时间的95％。而据中共泰安地委会的检查，泰安专区其余各县的会议之多和莱芜县的情况也基本相似。
    会议过多的情况，不但存在于农村中，同样也存在于企业系统中。例如，沈阳变压器厂的党委书记从二月十六日到三月二日的十五天中，有十一天半的时间都在开会，其中参加上级各个部门的会议就占了七天。就这样，还有一些上级召开的会议他们没有能够参加。
    过多的会议，既直接影响着上级机关进行深入具体的领导，也直接影响着下级机关和基层组织的正常工作。拿安徽省濉溪县淮北农业生产合作社的社长郑思功和副社长梁士生来说，他们从入春以来的九十天中一直在开会。从参加省的、专区的、县的会议，直到参加区的会议，从参加劳动模范会议、整社工作会议、农业技术会议，直到参加水利工作会议、治安工作会议、交通工作会议，有时两个人同时被召集参加同一个会议，开会占去了他们绝大部分的工作时间。社长郑思功有时候只得白天在县里参加会议，晚上跑回十四里以外的合作社研究生产问题。
    就这样，一种不正常的情况就发生了：上级机关要求下级机关加强深入具体的领导，但是下级机关的领导干部又被上级机关召集的和布置的会议纠缠起来，没有时间深入下去。下级机关也要求上级机关多给一些具体的帮助和指导，上级机关也在喊要深入下去，但是也被自己安排的过多的会议拖住了，经常离不开办公室。
    会议是集体地讨论和解决问题的一种重要形式，必要的会议是不可少的。问题是会议不应该过多。如何解决会议过多的问题呢？这需要上级领导机关对自己所要召集的会议和要下级召集的会议进行严格控制和全面规划。使会议开得少一些、短一些，开得更有准备和更能解决问题，关键在于上级领导机关要多作一些深入具体的工作，少召集下级干部上去开会，少向下级机关布置会议。否则，下级党组织对很多会议就不能控制，也无法规划。还以莱芜县为例，这个县三月份召开的二十二次会议中，有十二次就是上级各个部门分别布置限期召开的。试问，莱芜县怎么对这许多会议进行控制和规划呢？莱芜县要把这十二个会议都开好，又哪里来得及充分准备呢？
    一切领导机关应该多为下级干部的困难着想，多为工作的实际效果着想。应该懂得“上面千条线，下面一根针”的道理。不要只是向下级布置任务，而不去了解下级能不能完成任务，也不去帮助下级完成任务。不要只是要求下级干部深入下去，而自己却老是高高在上，又不给下级干部深入下去的时间。了解下级干部的困难，倾听下级干部的要求，经常地具体地帮助和指导下级干部做好工作，是我们党的领导作风的优良传统。领导者应该发扬这个传统，力求深入下层，接近群众。
    领导机关的领导干部深入下层，不但可以去了解情况，检查工作，有些指示也可以拿到下面去传达，有些工作也可以拿到下面去布置。具体地指导下级干部执行指示、安排工作，切实地帮助下级干部解决问题、总结经验，不但可以减少上面的会议，也可以减少下面的会议；不但可以使领导者学会进行具体领导这一重要方法，而且可以有效地帮助下面的干部克服一般化的领导作风。哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂的领导上采取“少开会，多下去”的办法，就是成功的一例。这个厂在今年三月下旬以前，从厂的领导人员到分场的和车间的领导人员都被纠缠在过多的会议之中，深入不下去。从三月下旬起，厂的领导上首先实行了控制会议的制度和每天到车间巡视的制度。结果，情况很快有了改变。从厂部到车间的会议开始减少了，对下面干部的具体帮助加强了。领导上也能够及时地发现和解决具体问题，及时地总结和传播先进经验。而分场和车间的领导作风，在厂的领导人员的示范和帮助之下，也开始转变了。
    当然，精简会议，深入下层，是一个重大问题，一定会碰到不少困难，一定要经过一些斗争。有一些领导人员的官僚主义习气是很严重的，他们并不认为自己经年累月蹲在办公室是脱离实际，脱离群众的。也还有一些领导人员，他们虽懂得不应该光蹲办公室，应该深入下去，但是他们总是没有深入下去。为什么呢？因为深入实际进行工作，比之高高在上发号施令，的确要遇到一些困难，而他们却没有决心克服困难。中共河南遂平县委会，为了改变大部分领导人员不经常下乡和个别领导人员经常不下乡的状况，制定了十一个县委委员和两个副部长下乡的全面规划，并且确定了各人下乡的日期和时间。中共山东泰安地委除确定了精简会议的原则，也作出了各级领导人员深入基层工作的具体规划；规定深入基层工作的时间，专区的领导人员每年为三个月，县的领导人员每年为四个月，区干部每年为八个月。这种办法值得提倡，这种决心也是值得学习的。
