South Xinjiang Travelogue
——Speech by Representative Chu Anping

Two months ago, I was traveling in the rural areas of southern Xinjiang. Now I want to reflect on a part of the agricultural socialist transformation in Xinjiang's ethnic minority areas. In Seman District, Shufu County, which I visited, the number of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives reached 95% of the total number of households in the district on February 1st of this year, gloriously entering socialist society. In recent years, Xinjiang farmers have undergone a series of social and democratic reform movements, and their thinking has greatly improved, and they accept new things quickly. In particular, they have an infinitely enthusiastic belief in the Party and Chairman Mao. They have calculated several accounts of the past few years and feel that every word spoken by the Party and Chairman Mao has been beneficial to them. Therefore, when the Party and Chairman Mao pointed out the path of agricultural producers' cooperation, they universally expressed positive feelings about joining cooperatives. Xinjiang's objective environment also has its own unique favorable conditions for promoting the agricultural cooperation movement. Xinjiang's past agricultural cultivation technology was generally relatively extensive. As long as rural labor is slightly organized and cultivation techniques are slightly improved, significant increases in production can be achieved, thereby strengthening farmers' confidence in getting organized. In addition, Xinjiang has always been sparsely populated, and the concept of private land ownership among ordinary farmers is relatively weak, which also has a positive impact on getting organized, especially from elementary to advanced cooperatives.

The Seman District I visited saw the emergence of mutual aid teams as early as 1951. In February 1954, 4 cooperatives were established on a trial basis. At that time, although some farmers joined the cooperatives, everyone was still somewhat apprehensive in their minds. The main thing was that they were afraid of suffering losses by joining the cooperatives, and afraid that their income would decrease instead. Farmers outside the cooperatives had an even greater wait-and-see attitude. They said, whether it's good or not, we'll see after the harvest. Some farmers also doubted whether the state would collect a portion of the grain produced by the cooperatives in the future? And whether the distribution would be fair and reasonable in the future? When those 4 cooperatives harvested that year, many farmers went to the cooperative's fields to visit. Before liberation, local wheat yielded about 150 jin per mu, sorghum 165 jin, corn 140 jin, rice 170 jin, and cotton only more than 30 jin, but the Xinlu Cooperative, established in 1954, yielded 377 jin of wheat per mu, 511 jin of sorghum, and 283 jin of rice; another cooperative, the Qianjin Cooperative, produced 208 jin of cotton per mu. However, farmers outside the cooperatives not only wanted to see whether production increased, but also whether the distribution was reasonable. During distribution, sometimes it continued until 12 o'clock at night, and farmers outside the cooperatives also watched until 12 o'clock at night. They all saw with their own eyes that the grain produced by the cooperatives was distributed to the members, and many hard-working members carried the grain they received, twenty or thirty bags (about 200 jin per bag), to their homes. Among the 75 member households of the 4 cooperatives established on a trial basis, 67 households increased their income. The knot in the minds of farmers outside the cooperatives was thus untied, and they all clamored to join and establish cooperatives everywhere.

After the summer harvest of 1954, the 4 cooperatives immediately expanded from the original 75 households to 238 households. In the winter of that year, 22 new cooperatives were built. However, the requirements of local farmers to join cooperatives were far from being met. In the autumn of 1955, the farmers' demands to join and build cooperatives became even more urgent. In the past, village cadres mobilized farmers to join cooperatives, but at this time, farmers surrounded the village cadres and demanded to join cooperatives. Some villages demanded to establish cooperatives for the entire village, and some townships demanded to establish cooperatives for the entire township. Those farmers who had not been admitted to the cooperatives questioned the village cadres, saying: "You usually promote the principles of cooperation and ask us to join cooperatives, but when we really want to join, you don't allow us to join. What's the reason?" One village, because the higher authorities did not approve their establishment of a cooperative, they spontaneously established one: they discussed and decided on specific issues such as how to divide the land, how to organize the labor force, how to stipulate land remuneration, how to calculate labor work points, how to use agricultural tools and livestock, and how much fertilizer and seeds should be brought when joining the cooperative. They also deliberated on the candidates for the director and committee members of the cooperative. They also jointly planted 60 mu of winter wheat in one breath to express their determination to build a cooperative. They also came up with a good name for the cooperative, they simply called it "Kangnai Boqi Ka" Cooperative. "Kangnai Boqi Ka" means "the water boiled itself." Later, I asked the director of this self-established cooperative, He Jiasiniyazi, why they were unwilling to wait any longer; he said: "At that time, all the neighbors in our village had established cooperatives, and only our village had not established one, and everyone felt very isolated. Our thinking at the time was: it is better to build than not to build. It is better to build early than late. Now who wants to fall behind? Who doesn't strive to step onto the new road of socialism one day earlier?"

While most farmers demanded to join cooperatives, some old cooperative members also demanded to transition from elementary to advanced cooperatives. Although these old cooperatives increased production year after year, and the income of the members also increased year after year, they always felt that there were still some problems hindering everyone from giving full play to their labor force. Among them, the issue of land remuneration was the most deeply felt by ordinary farmers. Those farmers with less land and more active labor felt unfair when they saw that a part of the fruits of their labor was taken by farmers with more land and less labor. They simply said: abolishing land remuneration is abolishing exploitation. They also said that land reform was the first liberation, and establishing advanced cooperatives was a complete liberation. When deliberating on the transition to advanced cooperatives, farmers not only had no objections to abolishing land remuneration and putting the main means of production under the collective ownership of the entire cooperative, but also strongly supported it. They said: more work, more gain, labor is glorious, don't rely on land anymore. When some elementary cooperatives were transitioning to advanced cooperatives, even before the specific issues of how to value the livestock were discussed clearly, the members brought their livestock, preparing to value them and return them to the cooperative.

After the Seman District comprehensively established advanced cooperatives, the leadership planned to first help two of its townships to create a seven-year plan from 1956 to 1962 for demonstration and experimentation. What surprised many cadres was that: when deliberating on this seven-year plan, everything that the leadership thought of, the farmers also thought of; some problems that the leadership had not thought of, the farmers also thought of. In some production indicators, the farmers proposed higher figures. The cadres said: "Your past yields were so low, how can you raise them so high in the future?" The farmers said: "Don't use the past as a base anymore, everyone's eyes should look forward." The farmers not only proposed specific production targets, but also proposed that every farmer should have a labor quota, so that increased production could be reliably guaranteed. The quota they proposed was an average of 200 workdays per person per year for men and women. When talking about the township plan, they not only talked about dividing the farming area, residential area, tractor road, canal, forest road, drainage ditch, etc. in a clear and orderly manner, but also proposed specific arrangements. Regarding expanding cultivated land, they not only proposed expansion targets, but also could provide an account, saying how much wasteland could be reclaimed, and how much cultivated land could be increased after leveling ridges and filling ditches. The farmers suggested buying a truck, they said: not only should cultivation and harvesting be mechanized, but also the transportation of fertilizer should be mechanized. The farmers proposed installing electric lights, telephones and radios, they said: "In the future, radio can be used to dispatch labor in the fields."

In the discussion of the future plan, it was fully seen that the minds of Xinjiang farmers were filled with many new things; and this point also shows that the Party's education on the vision of a socialist society, which has been carried out to the people of the whole country in recent years, has already had a certain foundation in the minds of Xinjiang farmers, and has been vividly and specifically reflected.

Not only do the broad masses of farmers in Xinjiang's ethnic minority areas unanimously and enthusiastically support the path of agricultural producers' cooperation indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao, but also the ethnic minority village cadres in Xinjiang have also learned the ability to run cooperatives independently through practical training. In the Seman District I visited, 81 new cooperatives were established one after another in the great development in the second half of 1955, and the establishment of these 81 new cooperatives was led by ethnic minority village cadres. A Uyghur township party branch secretary, Tusong Abudula, said: "Through the practical training of building cooperatives, our work ability and ideological level have been improved. We are no longer like in the past, when we encounter difficulties, we don't know what to do, and we have to rely on the higher authorities to solve them. Now, we have been able to independently discover some problems, and we can solve some problems ourselves. We can not only lead in production technology, but also further lead in policy and ideology."

The situations I saw in the rural areas of southern Xinjiang, in addition to illustrating that the socialist transformation of agriculture has also achieved great results in the ethnic minority areas of Xinjiang, what impressed me even more was the true strength and unity of our country. Although it is in the border areas, although it is in the ethnic minority areas, although those places are thousands of kilometers away from the capital of our motherland, the policies and decrees of the Party and the state are thoroughly implemented in those remote places as well. However, what is the key to creating this true strength and unity of the whole country? The key is the extremely correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao in national affairs, and the infinite belief and love of the people of the whole country for the Party and Chairman Mao.

    南疆旅途见闻
    ——储安平代表的发言
    两个月以前，我正在南疆农村旅行。我现在想反映新疆民族地区农业社会主义改造的一部分情况。在我所访问的疏附县色满区，他们在今年2月1日，加入高级社的农户就达到全区总农户的95％，光荣地进入了社会主义社会。新疆农民这几年来，经过一系列的社会民主改革运动，思想上有很大提高，接受新鲜事物很快。特别是对于党和毛主席，具有无限热烈的信仰。他们算了算这几年来的几笔账，感到党和毛主席说的话，没有一句不是对他们有利的。因而，当党和毛主席指出了农业生产合作化的道路以后，他们对于加入合作社，普遍表现了积极的感情。新疆的客观环境对于推动农业合作化运动也有它特有的有利条件。新疆过去的农业耕作技术一般比较粗放，只要对农村劳动力稍加组织，把耕作技术稍为提高，就能够收到显著的增产效果，从而加强了农民对于组织起来的信心。此外，新疆一向地广人稀，一般农民对于土地私有的观念比较淡薄，这对于组织起来，特别是从初级社转高级社，也具有有利的影响。
    我所访问的那个色满区，在1951年就出现了互助组的形式。1954年2月试办了
  4个社。那时虽然有一部分农民加入了社，但大家在思想上还多少有些顾虑。主要是怕入了社吃亏，怕收入反而减少。社外农民观望的成分更大。他们说，好也吧，不好也吧，要收了再看。也有些农民怀疑将来合作社生产的粮食国家会不会收去一部分？将来分配时会不会公平合理？那年那
  4个社收割时，很多农民都到合作社的地里参观。解放以前，当地的小麦每亩约产150斤、高粱165斤、玉米140斤、水稻170斤、棉花则只产30多斤，但1954年办的新路社，小麦每亩产377斤、高粱511斤、水稻283斤；另外一个前进社，他们的棉花每亩产到208斤，但是社外农民不仅要看生产是否增加，还要看分配是否合理。分配时，有时一直要分配到深夜12时，社外农民也就看到深夜12时。他们都亲眼看到合作社生产的粮食都是分给了社员的，很多劳动好的社员，二十几口袋、三十几口袋（一口袋约200斤）地把分到的粮食往自己家里搬。试办的4个社75户社员中有67户都增加了收入。社外农民思想里的结因之解开，于是到处都纷纷要求入社办社。
    1954年夏收后，那4个社立刻由原有的75户扩大到238户。那年冬天又新建了22个社。但是对于当地农民入社的要求还远不能满足。1955年秋天，农民入社建社的要求更其迫切，从前是乡村干部动员农民入社，这时变成农民包围乡村干部要求入社。有的是全村要求办社，有的是全乡要求办社。那些没有被吸收入社的农民质问乡村干部说：“你们平时宣传合作化的道理，要我们加入合作社，可是我们真要加入时，你们又不让，这是什么道理？”有一个村子，上级没有批准他们办社，他们就自发地办了起来：他们把地块如何划分、劳动力如何编组、土地报酬如何规定、劳动工分如何计算，农具和牲畜如何使用、入社应带多少肥料和种籽等具体问题都一一讨论决定，对于社主任和社务委员的人选也作了酝酿。他们还一口气合力种了60亩冬麦，以表示他们建社的决心。社叫什么名字，他们也想出了一个好名字，他们干脆就叫“康耐拨起卡”社。“康耐拨起卡”的意思就是“水自己沸开了”，后来我问这个自办社的社主任和加西尼亚子，问他们为什么不愿意再等一等；他说：“那时我村的四邻都建了社，只有我们一个村还没有建社，大家感到很孤立。我们当时的思想是：建比不建好。早建比迟建好。现在谁愿意落后？谁不争着早一天踏上社会主义新的大路？”
    在大部分农民要求加入合作社的同时，一些老社社员又要求从初级社转高级社。这些老社虽然年年增产，社员的收入也年年增加，但他们总感到还有一些问题阻碍着大家高度发挥自己的劳动力。其中一般农民感觉最深的就是土地报酬问题。那些土地较少、劳动积极的农民看到自己劳动的果实有一部分被土地较多而劳动又不很好的农民分了去，心中不平。他们干脆地说：取消土地报酬就是取消剥削。他们又说土改是第一次翻身，办高级社是彻底翻身。在酝酿转高级社时，农民对于取消土地报酬，把主要生产资料归全社集体所有，不仅没有意见，而且极力拥护。他们说：多劳多得，劳动才光荣，不要再依靠土地。有些初级社在转高级社时，对于耕畜如何折价的具体问题还没有讨论清楚，社员就把自己的耕畜牵了来，预备折价归社了。
      当色满区全面建立了高级社以后，领导上为了示范试验，打算先帮助其中两个乡作出一个从1956到1962的七年规划。出于很多干部意外的是：在酝酿这个七年规划的时候，凡是领导上想到了的，农民也都想到了；有些问题领导上没有想到的，农民也都想到了。在有些生产指标上，农民提得比较高。干部说：“你们过去的产量
  这样低，将来怎能提得那样高？”农民就说：“再不要拿过去做底子了，大家的眼睛应该朝前面看。”农民不仅提出了具体的生产指标，而且还提出，每一个农民都应该有一个劳动定额，使增产得到可靠的保证。他们提出的定额是男女平均每人每年作200个劳动日。谈到全乡规划时，他们不仅对要划分耕作区、住宅区、拖拉机道、渠道、林道、排水沟等谈得头头是道，而且还提出了具体的安排。关于扩大耕地，他们不仅提出了扩大的目标，而且还能开出一笔账来，说哪儿有多少可开的荒地，平埂填渠以后又可增加多少耕地。农民建议要买一辆卡车，他们说：不仅耕作收割要机械化，就是运送肥料也要机械化。农民提出要装置电灯、电话和广播，他们说：“将来可以用广播来调度田间的劳动。”
    在未来规划的讨论中，充分看出新疆农民的脑子里装着很多的新鲜事物；而这一点又说明：这几年来党对全国人民所进行的社会主义社会的远景教育，已经在新疆农民思想上有了一定的基础，并已生动具体地反映了出来。
    不仅新疆民族地区的广大农民一致地热烈地拥护党和毛主席所指示的农业生产的合作化道路，而且，新疆的民族乡村干部通过实际的锻炼，也都已学会了独立办社的本领。在我所访问的色满区，在1955年下半年的大发展中，先后建立了81个新社，这81个新社的建立都是由民族乡村干部领导的。有一个维吾尔族的乡支部书记吐松阿不都拉说：“经过建社的实际锻炼，我们的工作能力和思想水平都有了提高。我们不再像过去一样，一遇到困难，就不知如何是好，非得依靠上级解决不可。现在，我们已经能够独立发现一些问题，并且可以自己解决一部分问题。我们不仅能在生产技术上进行领导，而且也进一步能够在政策思想上进行领导了。”
    我在南疆农村中所看到的这些情况，除了说明农业社会主义改造在新疆民族地区也收到了巨大的成绩以外，使我印象更为深刻的乃是我们国家的真正强大统一。虽然是在边疆地区，虽然是在民族地区，虽然那些地方离我们祖国的首都有几千公里远，但是党和国家的政策法令在那遥远的地方也一样透彻地贯彻着。然而造成这种全国真正强大统一的关键究竟是什么？关键就是党和毛主席对于国家事务极其正确的领导，以及全国人民对党对毛主席的无限的信仰和无限的爱。
