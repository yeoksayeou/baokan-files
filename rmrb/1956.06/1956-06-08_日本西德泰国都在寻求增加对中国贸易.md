Xinhua News Agency, June 6th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi said in Shizuoka that, like Britain, Japan must make greater efforts to increase trade with China.

Ishibashi revealed that the Japanese government has decided to more actively invoke the “exception procedure” to export embargoed materials. He said that Japan is making its utmost efforts to relax the types of embargoed materials to China to be the same as those for the Soviet Union.

Ishibashi also said that regarding the payment agreement between Japan and China, it is planned that the Bank of China and the Bank of Tokyo will conclude a contract in the future to facilitate payments. He admitted that it is currently inconvenient to settle accounts in London.

Ishibashi also said that in order to find ways to expand trade, he is willing to have the Japan-China Export-Import Association as the main body for Japan and China to exchange private business representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, June 7th, According to a Reuters report, West German business figures said in Bonn on the 6th that West German authorities are studying “the possibility of relaxing the embargo on China.”

The report said that West Germany was "particularly interested" in Britain's relaxation of exports to China. The Secretary-General of the West German Committee for Trade with the East, Mr. Knap, said on the 6th that he expects that "if Britain relaxes the embargo regulations, West Germany will follow suit." He pointed out that relaxing the embargo on machinery manufacturing industrial products will greatly increase West Germany's exports to China.

The Paris weekly "International Forum" reported in an article not long ago that industrialists in Dusseldorf are facing East. Industrialists in the Ruhr area have become uneasy about the downward trend in demand in some overseas markets in West Germany, and they have launched a movement, resolutely demanding that the West German government abolish all restrictions on trade with the East as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, June 7th, Bangkok dispatch: Thai Finance Minister Yuthakit said in a conversation on June 6th that the Thai cabinet is studying the issue of direct trade with China.

Yuthakit also said that merchants have the right to charter foreign ships to import goods directly from China. Agence France-Presse said that this is a change in the Thai government's attitude towards trade with China. Currently, Thai authorities do not welcome ships that have been to Chinese ports, and the crew members on these ships are prohibited from disembarking in Thailand.

    日本西德泰国都在寻求增加对中国贸易
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本通商产业相石桥湛山在静冈说，像英国一样，日本必须作出更大的努力来增加同中国的贸易。
    石桥透露，日本政府已经决定更加积极地援用“例外程序”来输出禁运物资。他说，日本正在作最大的努力，以使对中国的禁运物资种类放宽到和对苏联的一样。
    石桥又说，关于日中两国的支付协定问题，今后准备由中国银行和东京银行缔结契约，以便能够简易地进行支付。他承认，目前在伦敦进行结算是不方便的。
    石桥还说，为了设法扩大贸易，愿意以日中输出入协会为主，使日中两国互换民间商务代表。
    新华社7日讯　据路透社报道，西德商业界人士六日在波恩说，西德当局正在研究“放宽对中国实行的禁运的可能性问题”。
    消息说，西德对英国放宽对中国出口的消息“特别感到兴趣”。西德对东方贸易委员会秘书长卡纳普六日说：他预料，“如果英国放宽禁运条例的话，西德将会仿效”。他指出，放宽对机器制造工业产品的禁运，将大大增加西德对中国的出口。
    巴黎“国际论坛”周刊不久以前在一篇文章里报道，杜塞尔多夫的工业家们正面向东方。鲁尔区工业家已经对西德某些海外市场的需求有下降趋势感到不安，他们发动了运动，坚决要求西德政府尽快的取消同东方进行贸易的一切限制。
    新华社7日讯　曼谷消息：泰国财政部长裕他吉六月六日在一次谈话中说，泰国内阁正在研究同中国进行直接贸易的问题。
    裕他吉还说，商人有权租用外国船只直接从中国进口货物。法新社说，这是泰国政府对同中国贸易的态度的改变。目前，泰国当局是不欢迎到过中国港口的船只的，这些船上的船员被禁止在泰国上岸。
