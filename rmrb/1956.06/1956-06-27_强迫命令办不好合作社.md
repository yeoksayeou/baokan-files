Currently, the coercive commanding style of rural cadres is growing again. Many township and cooperative cadres are not using persuasive education methods to mobilize members to invest, but are instead adopting methods of forced apportionment. In the work of changing farming systems, constructing farmland water conservancy, and even organizing members to study culture, they are also adopting methods of rigidly assigning tasks and forcing members to obey decisions. These practices of theirs have aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of members and have already affected the production of cooperatives and other rural work.

Among these grassroots cadres who have committed the error of coercive commanding, apart from a very small number of bad elements who ride on the heads of the masses and act tyrannically, the vast majority are people who have been relatively active and responsible in the past. The reason why they are now coercively commanding the masses is mainly because they have been blinded by victory and have overestimated the ideological awareness of the masses. They say, "Now that cooperativization has been achieved, there is no need to do arduous persuasive education work anymore!" Or they say, "Such a major event as establishing a cooperative with a completely socialist nature and changing the ownership of the means of production only took a few days; is it really necessary to spend more time and effort to mobilize members to invest, build farmland water conservancy, and change farming systems?" "The cooperative implements the distribution principle of 'to each according to his work, more work more gain,' who can not actively and spontaneously participate in labor production?" Thus, when they carry out their work, they no longer go to understand and study the ideological situation of the members, nor do they carry out ideological education work for the members, but simply assign tasks to the members. Some members are unwilling to act according to their intentions, so they put the hats of "backward" and "conservative" on these members, and use coercive commanding methods to make these members obey their decisions. They also say, "For the sake of collective interests, for the sake of the interests of the cooperative, coercive commanding is also right."

After the agricultural cooperativization, the peasants' political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm are indeed very high, not only is there a guarantee of increased agricultural production, but also many rural tasks are much easier to do than before, this is an undeniable fact. But it should not be denied that the vast majority of members still retain the ideological consciousness of individual farmers, therefore, whether in primary or advanced cooperatives, the struggle between individualism and collectivism is still continuing. For example, many members often want to take advantage of the cooperative, many members do not cherish the public property of the cooperative, and intentionally or unintentionally damage or lose the cooperative's farm tools. Even among some members with higher ideological awareness and active enthusiasm for work, there are still ideological problems. All this shows that the party's grassroots organizations must not relax political work, but should strengthen ideological education for members. Only in this way is it possible to run the cooperative well. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside": "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true in a period when fundamental changes are taking place in the social and economic system." Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong requires us to do a very specific and meticulous job of ideological education for farmers based on their life experience, and not to use a rude attitude and simple methods to solve the ideological problems of farmers.

Before the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization in the country, farmers were independently and dispersedly engaged in production, therefore, grassroots cadres could only generally use political methods to coercively command farmers. After the vast majority of farmers joined the cooperative, grassroots cadres can not only use political methods, but also use economic methods to coercively command the masses. They say, "The land belongs to the cooperative, I have the members by the pigtail, I can do whatever I want." So they act arbitrarily and decide everything; whoever does not obey their decisions, they use methods such as "deducting work points" (deducting the work points already earned by the members) and "suspending labor" (not assigning work to do) to force them to obey. "Deducting work points" and "suspending labor" have actually become one of the main methods used by current grassroots cadres to implement disguised coercive commanding, whether in mobilizing members to attend work, convening members to meetings, or organizing cultural learning, they have adopted this method. Gezhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Handang Township, Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, stipulates that members who do not attend meetings will have their work points deducted. The Third Agricultural Cooperative of Zhuangruan Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, said to a female member who insisted on returning to her parents' home: If you want to return to your parents' home, your work points will be deducted. Some grassroots cadres in each district of Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, used the method of "suspending labor" to punish members who did not obey their decisions.

Agricultural production cooperatives are economic organizations voluntarily formed by farmers, and the leading cadres of cooperatives are only entrusted by the members to manage the affairs of the cooperative. This entrustment does not mean that the cadres of the cooperative are given any privileges, on the contrary, because whether the production and work of the cooperative can be done well is directly related to the quality of the work of these cadres, therefore the responsibilities of these cadres are very great. All cadres of the cooperative should widely promote democracy in their work, ensuring that major matters are submitted to the management committee or the members' congress for discussion and decision, and that minor matters are discussed among the cadres, encouraging members to boldly and frequently make various criticisms and suggestions on the work of the cooperative. After the work tasks have been decided, extensive and in-depth publicity and explanation work should be carried out for the members, especially patient persuasive education should be carried out for the few members who are ideologically blocked. Only by adopting this democratic and persuasive educational method to manage the cooperative can the ideological awareness of the members be continuously improved, their enthusiasm and creativity be fully brought into play, and the cooperative be run well.

To correct the coercive commanding style of grassroots cadres, the party committees above the county and district levels must also improve their leadership style and leadership methods. At present, many leading organs and leading cadres of party committees above the county and district levels have also developed a blind optimistic mood and relaxed the party's political and ideological work. When arranging and summarizing production, they do not talk about or rarely talk about the party's political and ideological work, and they are often busy urging the lower levels to report production achievements after the tasks have been arranged. As for what methods the grassroots cadres actually use to complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, and whether they have implemented the party's policies in their work, they rarely ask about it. What is particularly noteworthy is that some persons in charge of county and district party committees have also developed a coercive commanding style, putting forward some work plans that are too high and too large and not in line with reality, and insisting that the lower levels implement them. The reason why the error of coercive commanding occurred quite universally in the well-digging work in Wei County, Hebei Province, is that the county party committee blindly pursued the quantity of well-digging, requiring grassroots cadres to complete the well-digging tasks within a time limit, and often labeled grassroots cadres with the hat of "ideologically conservative", and promoted the practice of forcing the masses to dig wells as a successful experience. There are also some county and district party committees that have put forward production and work plans that are in line with reality, but when they explain them to the lower levels, they overemphasize that cadres who do not obey the leadership and fail to complete the tasks should be given disciplinary action, while neglecting persuasive education. In this way, grassroots cadres have a misconception that only by using administrative orders can agricultural production and other rural work be done well. In the process of promoting agricultural production technology reform in Dianbai, Suixi and other counties in Guangdong Province, the county party committee overly emphasized giving disciplinary action to party member cadres who did not lead the masses to change from scattering seeds to point sowing and strip sowing, and notified this type of incident to all townships and cooperatives in the county, thus making many township and cooperative cadres very nervous, and they also used the method of "if you do not change from scattering seeds to point sowing, you will be punished" to force farmers to implement the reform of production technology. This shows that the subjective and bureaucratic leadership style and leadership methods of county and district party committees are an extremely important reason for the occurrence of coercive commanding in rural areas. Therefore, county and district party committees must simultaneously improve their leadership style and leadership methods, go deep into reality, contact the masses, and give grassroots cadres more specific help and guidance, especially to set an example in using persuasive education methods to carry out work. Only in this way can the coercive commanding style of grassroots cadres be corrected more effectively.

### 强迫命令办不好合作社

    强迫命令办不好合作社
    目前，农村干部中的强迫命令作风又滋长起来了。许多乡、社干部在动员社员投资，不是用说服教育的方法，而是采取强迫摊派的方法。在改变耕作制度、兴修农田水利，以至组织社员学习文化的工作中，也都是采取硬性分派任务和强迫社员服从决定的办法。他们的这些做法，已经引起了多数社员的不满，并且已经影响到合作社的生产和农村其他工作。
    在这些犯有强迫命令错误的基层干部中，除极少数人是骑在群众头上作威作福的坏分子以外，绝大多数是过去工作比较积极负责的人，现在他们所以对群众强迫命令，主要是被胜利冲昏了头脑，过高地估计了群众的思想觉悟。他们说：“合作化了，不再需要做艰苦的说服教育工作了！”或者说：“成立完全社会主义性质的合作社，改变生产资料所有制这样的大事，都只要几天工夫；难道现在发动社员投资、兴修农田水利和改变耕作制度，还需要费更多的口舌吗？”“合作社里实行‘按劳取酬，多劳多得’的分配原则，谁又能够不积极主动参加劳动生产呢？”这样，他们在进行工作的时候，就不再去了解和研究社员的思想情况，对社员进行思想教育工作，而是简单地给社员摊派任务。有些社员不愿意按照他们的意图办事，他们就给这些社员戴上“落后”、“保守”的帽子，用强迫命令的办法使这些社员服从他们的决定。他们还说：“为了集体利益，为了社的利益，强迫命令也是对的。”
    农业合作化以后，农民的政治热情和生产积极性确实很高，不仅农业增产有保证了，而且农村的许多工作比以前好做得多了，这是无可否认的事实。但是也不应否认这样一个事实：绝大多数社员还保留有个体农民的思想意识，因此，不论在初级社或高级社中，个人主义同集体主义之间的斗争还是在继续着的。例如不少社员常常想占合作社的便宜，不少社员不爱护合作社的公共财物，有意无意地损坏、丢失合作社的农具。就是在一些思想觉悟较高、工作积极热情的社员中间，也不是完全没有思想问题。所有这些都说明，党的基层组织决不能放松政治工作，而应当加强对社员的思想教育。只有这样，才有可能把合作社办好。毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”中说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”因此，毛泽东同志要求我们必须根据农民的生活经验，很具体地很细致地做好对农民的思想教育工作，不能用粗暴的态度和简单的方法去解决农民的思想问题。
    在全国基本上实现农业合作化以前，农民是独立地分散地进行生产，因此，基层干部要对农民实行强迫命令，一般只能采用政治的方法。而在绝大多数农民加入合作社以后，基层干部就不仅可以用政治的方法，还可以用经济的方法来对群众实行强迫命令。他们说：“土地归了社，社员的小辫子抓在我手里，要怎样摆布就怎样摆布。”于是他们独断专行，决定一切；谁要不服从他们的决定，就用“扣工分”（扣社员已得的工分）“停止劳动”（不给分配活做）等办法来强迫谁服从。“扣工分”“停止劳动”，实际上已成为当前基层干部实行变相强迫命令的主要方法之一，不论是在动员社员出勤、召集社员开会或组织文化学习上，他们都采用了这个办法。江苏省沭阳县韩荡乡葛庄农业社，就规定了社员不参加会议要扣工分。广东省新会县壮阮乡第三农业社对一个坚持要回娘家的女社员说：你要回娘家就要扣你的工分。山东省平原县各区都有些基层干部用“停止劳动”的办法，处分不服从他们决定的社员。
    农业生产合作社是农民自愿结合的经济组织，合作社的领导干部，只是受社员的委托来管理社务。这种委托并不意味着给了社的干部任何特权，相反的，由于合作社的生产和工作能否搞好，直接同这些干部的工作好坏有关，因此这些干部的责任是很大的。合作社的一切干部应当在工作中广泛地发扬民主，做到大事提交社务委员会或社员大会讨论并作出决定，小事在干部之间进行磋商，鼓励社员大胆地经常地对社的工作提出各种批评和建议。而在工作任务一经决定以后，就应对社员进行广泛深入的宣传解释工作，特别是要对少数思想不通的社员进行耐心的说服教育。只有采取这种民主的和说服教育的方法来管理合作社，才能不断地提高社员的思想觉悟，充分发挥他们的积极性创造性，把合作社办好。
    要纠正基层干部的强迫命令作风，还得县区以上党委改进自己的领导作风和领导方法。目前，有不少县区以上党委领导机关和领导干部也滋长了盲目乐观的情绪，放松了党的政治思想工作。在布置和总结生产的时候，他们不谈或很少谈党的政治思想工作情况，并且常常是任务一经布置下去以后，就忙着催促下面报告生产成绩。至于基层干部究竟采用什么方法去完成上级所布置的任务，在工作中是否贯彻执行了党的政策，他们就很少过问。特别值得注意的是，有些县区党委的负责人也滋长了强迫命令的作风，提出了一些过高过大不切合实际的工作计划，硬要下级执行。河北省蔚县在打井工作中所以相当普遍地发生了强迫命令的错误，就是由于这个县的县委盲目地追求打井的数量，要基层干部限期完成打井的任务，并且动辄给基层干部扣上“思想保守”的帽子，把强迫群众打井的做法也当成成功的经验加以推广。还有一些县区党委提出的生产和工作计划虽然是切合实际的，但是他们在向下交代的时候，过分强调了对不服从领导、完不成任务的干部要给以纪律处分，而忽略了说服教育。这样，就使基层干部产生了一种错觉，以为要搞好农业生产和农村的其他工作，只有使用行政命令。广东省电白、遂溪等县在推行农业生产技术改革中，就是由于县委过于强调给予不领导群众改撒种为点种和条播的党员干部以纪律处分，并且把这类事件通报全县各乡各社，这样，就弄得许多乡、社干部都很紧张，他们也用“不改撒种为点种就要受处分”的办法来强迫农民实行生产技术的改革。这就说明了，县区以上党委的主观主义和官僚主义的领导作风和领导方法，是农村中发生强迫命令的一个极其重要的原因。因此，县区以上党委必须同时改进自己的领导作风和领导方法，深入实际，联系群众，多给基层干部以具体的帮助和指导，特别是要以身作则地用说服教育的方法来进行工作。只有这样，才能更加有效地纠正基层干部中的强迫命令作风。
