The Guanzhong area, comprising forty-four counties (cities), is the main wheat-producing area of Shaanxi Province. This year, over 17 million mu of wheat were planted, accounting for more than 70% of the province's total wheat area.

According to current forecasts, this year's wheat yield may be the largest in recent decades. Several counties, with approximately millions of mu of wheat fields, have an average yield of around 400 jin, and many high-yield fields have yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu.

Many people are surprised by this year's bumper wheat harvest. People coming from the coastal areas to support the interior, upon passing Tongguan, crowded at the train windows, looking at this boundless wheat field, and excitedly exclaimed: "This is simply the granary of the motherland!" Wheat visiting groups from Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Gansu, Hubei, Sichuan, Guangxi and other provinces, some of whom are experts in agricultural production, some are leaders of agricultural organizations, and some are agricultural technicians. When they saw the wheat here, they also exclaimed in surprise: "Unexpectedly, tens of millions of mu of wheat have universally achieved a bumper harvest!"

What are the reasons that Guanzhong wheat has been able to achieve a universal bumper harvest? Many people have raised this question and are searching for answers.

Some say that the Guanzhong Plain has fertile land, and the farmers here have relied on growing wheat for generations, which is the main reason for this year's universal bumper harvest. This statement is only partially true, because in this fertile land, wheat has never had such a harvest in the past. Especially before liberation, the farmers here, like the farmers in other wheat-producing areas of the country, did not pay attention to planting techniques and rarely applied fertilizer, so wheat yields were always very low. According to surveys, before liberation, the average wheat yield here was around 70 or 80 jin. Obviously, it is impractical to take natural conditions as the main reason for this year's universal bumper harvest. So, what are the main reasons for the universal bumper harvest?

According to our several days of investigation, the main reasons are the universal promotion of improved varieties, improved wheat field cultivation techniques, and the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. More than 90% of the wheat fields in the Guanzhong area use the "Bima No. 1" improved variety; close planting and the prevention and control of wheat sucking midge damage have been universally implemented. However, these improvements were not achieved all at once, but gradually realized through continuous struggles over the years.

As early as when our country began to restore industrial and agricultural production, the Party organizations and People's Government of Shaanxi Province regarded the restoration and development of wheat production as the central link in increasing grain production. The Party and government leaders have continuously gone deep into the rural areas to conduct investigations and research, and learned that the main reasons why wheat could not increase production before liberation were poor varieties, extensive cultivation techniques, and damage from diseases and insect pests. Therefore, reforms were carried out step by step from these aspects.

In the course of reform, the difficulties encountered were the resistance of conservative ideas from leading organs, cadres, and the masses of farmers. For example, when the Provincial Department of Agriculture proposed a plan to universally promote the "Bima No. 1" improved wheat variety in the main wheat-producing areas, some personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture and the former Northwest Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry had concerns. Based on the results of investigation and research, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China resolutely supported the plan of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture.

The masses of farmers had even greater resistance to reforming cultivation techniques. When asked to plant the "Bima No. 1" improved variety, they said it was "foreign wheat" and the harvest was unreliable. When asked to hoe the wheat, they said "nine out of ten wheat fields are not hoeed," "I have never heard of hoeing wheat before." When close planting of wheat was proposed, they said "generations have planted wheat with two and a half sheng of wheat seeds" (two and a half sheng per mu, equivalent to six or seven jin of wheat), "There is little fertilizer and the land is thin, and if you plant it too densely, it won't grow..." Wheat sucking midge is a deadly pest to wheat here, and the area of harm is very large. In severely affected areas, wheat production is reduced by 60 to 70 jin to more than 100 jin per mu. Due to the harm of wheat sucking midge, wheat fields are shrinking more and more. For example, Songjiapo Village in Wugong County originally had more than 300 mu of wheat land, which has been reduced to more than 40 mu. Because the farmers did not know about wheat sucking midge in the past, they attributed the harm brought by sucking midge to "Heaven's will." When the People's Government mobilized farmers to prevent and control wheat sucking midge, they could not accept it. They said they would go to prevent and control the pests in front of the working staff, but when the working staff left, they would not go, or if they went to the fields, they would just do it perfunctorily and not seriously prevent and control the pests.

The Provincial Department of Agriculture and agricultural departments at all levels, based on the farmers' characteristics of "seeing first, then trying, and then doing," carried out a series of demonstration works to prevent and control wheat sucking midge, organized farmers to observe, and let the farmers see the benefits from practice before universally promoting the methods.

Various pilot projects for cultivation technique reform were carried out in various counties in Guanzhong. There were pilot projects for close planting of wheat, pilot projects for the "Bima No. 1" improved wheat variety, and pilot projects for fertilization, winter irrigation, and weeding. Through the pilot projects, advanced wheat planting techniques gradually spread among the masses. The amount of wheat sown has increased year by year. According to the statistics of Yangpo Village in Lintong County over the years, the amount of wheat sown in the whole village increased from six or seven jin per mu in 1952 to ten jin per mu, to thirteen jin per mu in 1953, to fifteen jin per mu in 1954, and to eighteen jin per mu in 1955. The area of wheat fields with improved cultivation techniques has increased every year. According to the statistics of Lintong County, taking fertilization as an example, in 1952, the area of wheat fields applying base fertilizer accounted for 35% of the total wheat field area, and the area of wheat fields applying topdressing accounted for 10% of the total wheat field area; by 1954, the area of base fertilizer reached 65%, and the area of topdressing reached 40%. There has also been a great increase in the amount of fertilizer applied. Before 1952, an average of two large carts of fertilizer were applied per mu of wheat field, which increased to four or five large carts by 1954. The area of wheat fields with other practices such as deep plowing and weeding has also increased year by year. Therefore, wheat yields have increased year by year. The average yield per mu of wheat in this county did not exceed 100 jin before liberation, the average yield per mu was 164 jin in 1952, the average yield per mu was 217 jin in 1953, and the average yield per mu was 245 jin in 1954.

The victory of agricultural cooperativization has provided favorable conditions for universally improving technology. According to a survey in Lintong County, this year, more than 95% of the wheat fields in the county are planted with "Bima No. 1" wheat, more than 70% of the wheat fields have been weeded two or three times, and topdressing was universally applied this spring. Therefore, this year the average wheat yield in Lintong reached 400 jin per mu (based on forecasts).

This year, wheat sucking midge damage occurred relatively universally in the Guanzhong wheat fields. The more serious ones were in Chang'an, Wugong, Hu, Xingping and other counties. According to a survey in Chang'an County, there are a total of 530,000 mu of wheat fields in the county, of which 350,000 mu have suffered from wheat sucking midge damage. In previous years, this disaster would have been inevitable, but thanks to the experience of preventing and controlling sucking midge over the past few years, and the victory of agricultural cooperativization, there are conditions for carrying out comprehensive prevention and control. This year's prevention and control of sucking midge is very different from previous years. Agricultural cooperatives have automatically organized shock teams to prevent and control sucking midge, and it only took six or seven days to wipe out the sucking midge, ensuring this year's bumper wheat harvest.

    关中地区的小麦为什么能够丰收
    本报记者　朱波
    关中地区，包括四十四个县（市），是陕西省的主要产麦区。今年共种了一千七百多万亩麦子，占全省小麦总面积的70％以上。
    根据目前的预测来看，今年这里的小麦产量，可能是最近几十年来最大的一次丰收。有几个县约数百万亩麦田，平均产量在四百斤左右，而且有不少的丰产田亩产量在千斤以上。
    很多人对今年的小麦丰收表示惊奇。从沿海来支援内地的人们，一过潼关，就都挤在火车的窗前，看着这片无边无际的小麦，他们兴奋地说：这简直是祖国的麦子囤啊！从山西、河南、河北、山东、安徽、江苏、甘肃、湖北、四川、广西等省来的小麦参观团，他们有的是农业生产的能手，有的是农业机关的领导人员，有的是农业技术人员。当他们看到这里的小麦的时候，也惊奇地说：想不到上千万亩小麦普遍地获得丰产！
    什么原因使关中小麦能够普遍地获得丰产呢？很多人都提出了这个问题，都在寻找答案。
    有人说，关中平原土地肥沃，这里的农民祖祖辈辈都靠种植小麦生活，这是今年普遍丰产的主要原因。这种说法只有部分道理，因为在这肥沃的土地上，过去小麦就没有过这样的丰收。特别是解放以前，这里的农民和全国其它产麦区的农民一样，不讲究种植技术，很少施肥，小麦产量一直很低。据调查，解放前这里的小麦平均产量在七、八十斤左右。很明显，如果把自然条件作为今年小麦普遍丰产的主要原因是不切合实际的。那么，普遍丰产的主要原因是什么呢？
    根据我们一连几天的调查，主要原因是普遍推广良种、改进麦田的耕作技术和防治病虫害。关中地区90％以上的麦田是用“碧玛一号”良种；普遍实行了密植和防治小麦吸浆虫的危害。然而，这些改进不是一下子办到的，而是在几年来不断的斗争中逐步实现的。
    还在我们国家开始进行恢复工、农业生产的时期，陕西省的党组织和人民政府就把恢复和发展小麦生产作为粮食增产的中心环节。党和政府的领导人员，曾不断地深入农村进行调查研究，了解到解放前小麦不能增产的主要原因是品种低劣、耕作技术粗放以及病虫为害。于是，就从这几个方面有步骤地进行改革。
    在进行改革当中，碰到的困难是领导机关、干部和农民群众保守思想的抵触。例如，当省农业厅提出在主要产麦区普遍推广“碧玛一号”小麦良种计划的时候，农业部和原西北农林局的某些人员就有顾虑。中共陕西省委会根据调查研究的结果，坚决支持了陕西省农业厅的计划。
    农民群众对改革耕作技术的抵触情绪更大。要他们种植“碧玛一号”良种，他们说是“洋麦子”，收成不可靠。要他们锄麦，他们说“十麦九不锄”，“从来还没有听说过锄麦子哩”。提出小麦“密植”，他们说“祖祖辈辈种麦子都是用两升半麦种”（每亩用两升半，合六、七斤小麦），“肥少地薄，种稠了长不起来”……小麦吸浆虫是这里小麦致命的虫害，危害的面积非常大。受害严重的地区，每亩小麦减产六、七十斤到一百多斤。由于小麦吸浆虫的危害，麦田愈来愈缩小了。如武功县宋家坡村原有小麦地三百多亩，已经减少到四十多亩。农民因为过去不知道有小麦吸浆虫，他们把吸浆虫带来的危害说成“天意”。当人民政府发动农民防治小麦吸浆虫的时候，他们都接受不了，当着工作人员的面说去防治，工作人员一离开就不去了，就是到地里去，也是应付一下，并不认真防治。
    省农业厅和各级农业部门，根据农民“先看、再试、然后干”的特点，进行一系列的防治小麦吸浆虫的示范工作，组织农民观摩，让农民从实际中看到好处之后，再普遍推广。
      关中各县都进行了各种耕作技术改革的试点工作。有小麦密植的试点，有“碧玛一号”小麦良种的试点，以及施肥、冬灌、锄草等试点。经过试点工作，种小麦的先进技术在群众中逐步传播开了。小麦的播种量逐年增加。据临潼县杨坡村历年来的统计，1952年全村小麦的播种量由每亩六、七斤增加到每亩十斤，1953年每亩增加到十三斤，1954年增加到十五斤，1955年增加到十八斤。改进耕作技术的麦田面积每年都有增加。根据临潼县全县的统计，以施肥为例，1952年施底肥的麦田面积占麦田总面积35％，施追肥的麦田面积占麦田总面积10％；到1954年，施底肥的面积达到65％，施追肥的面积达到40％。在施肥量上也有很大的增加。在1952年以前，平均每亩麦田施肥两大车，到1954年增加到四、五大车。其它如实行深耕、锄草等的麦田面积，也逐年增加。因此，小麦的产量一年比一年提高。这个县解放前小麦平均亩产不超过一百斤，1952年平均亩产一百六十四斤，1953年平均亩产二百一十七斤，1954年平均亩产二百四十五斤。
    农业合作化的胜利，给普遍地改进技术提供了有利的条件。根据临潼县调查，今年全县的麦田，有95％以上是“碧玛一号”小麦，有70％以上的麦田锄了两、三遍草，而且，今年春天普遍地施了追肥。因此今年临潼小麦产量平均每亩达到四百斤（根据预测）。
      今年，关中麦田比较普遍地发生小麦吸浆虫害。其中比较严重的是长安、武功、鄠县、兴平等县。根据长安县的调查，全县共有五十三万亩麦田，其中三十五万亩遭受小麦吸浆虫的危害。如果在往年，这个灾害是不可避免的，但是由于有了几年来防治吸浆虫的经验，有了农业合作化的胜利，就有了进行全面防治的条件。今年防治吸浆虫和往年大不相同，各农业合作社自动地组织了防治吸浆虫的突击队，只用了六、七天的时间，就把吸浆虫扑灭，保住了今年小麦的丰收。
