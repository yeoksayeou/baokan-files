    Living in the Great Unity of Nationalities in New China
    —Speech by Representative Zai Tao
    My name is Zai Tao, and I belong to the Manchu nationality, one of the minority nationalities. This time, I am attending the Third Session of the National People's Congress. I have listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, Minister Liao Luyan's report on the draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I fully agree with the contents of the reports and wholeheartedly support them.
    Before the meeting, I went to Guangdong Province and inspected Hainan Island. Now, I will briefly report to the representatives some of the situations I personally saw and my thoughts.
    During this inspection, I first paid attention to the living conditions of various minority nationalities and the implementation of ethnic policies in various regions.
    On Hainan Island, a very remote area in southern China, the island has a population of about 2.6 million, including more than 340,000 Li people, more than 120,000 Miao people, and other ethnic groups such as Hui, Yao, and Zhuang, whose populations are relatively small. The areas where these minority nationalities live account for about 60% of the island's total area. Before liberation, the minority nationalities on the island lived in the so-called "savage mountains," living the lives of primitive humans, with no material demands and even less political treatment. Over the years, they have suffered from the persecution of the Japanese puppet army and the insults of the Kuomintang reactionary government. In the past, they hid in valleys and eked out a living. Now, their lives have greatly changed. The highways through the mountainous areas inhabited by minority nationalities on the island are now open, and there are buses to Haikou and Yulin every day. In 1952, the Li and Miao Autonomous Region was established (now the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture). The head and deputy head of the prefecture are respectively held by Li and Miao people, and the capital of the autonomous prefecture, Tongshi, has been built. There are administrative organs, cadre schools, people's hospitals, normal schools, primary schools, nurseries, supply and marketing cooperatives, state-owned department stores, Xinhua bookstores, and so on. I also visited the Fanmao Advanced Agricultural Cooperative, which is entirely composed of Li members. All these actual situations fully demonstrate the spirit of ethnic autonomy, showing how the government is doing its best to lead the backward minority nationalities to a path of prosperity and progress, proving the correctness of the Party and the government's ethnic policies.
    In Guangdong, I investigated the situation of the Manchu people in Guangzhou City. There are about 2,000 Manchu people in the city. They had suffered from the discrimination and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government, so they changed their names and concealed their Manchu identity in order to survive. After liberation, they studied the Party and government's ethnic policies and realized true equality and true freedom. They suddenly woke up, were moved to tears, and re-exposed their ethnic identity. Today, some work as cadres in government agencies, some teach in schools, and they have organized Manchu children's schools, small handicraft factories, and so on. Manchu women are also actively participating in various labors. In general, they can all cheer up and strive to embark on the road of building a socialist society together.
    In Guangdong, I also visited some factories, such as the state-owned paper mill, the state-owned cement factory, the state-owned Shunde sugar factory, the Zini sugar factory, the state-owned Shunde silk factory, the joint state-private sack factory, and so on. Some of these are newly built, and some are being expanded. They are all producing according to the planned schedule, and the output and quality have improved year by year. These industries are planning to have large-scale development in the near future.
    Regarding agriculture in Guangdong, I also visited the Shunde Agricultural Cooperative. Before this year's spring plowing, more than 92% of the province's farmers had participated in cooperatives, and it is expected that advanced forms of cooperation will be basically realized before this year's autumn harvest. This shows that the progress of agricultural production organizations in Guangdong is advancing by leaps and bounds, and the agricultural production plan will definitely be completed ahead of schedule.
    We Manchus, living in the great unity of nationalities in today's New China, are marching towards a bright and happy future and embarking on the road of building a socialist society alongside all fraternal nationalities. I am very excited to represent our Manchu people and shout long live the ever-peaceful construction of a glorious, splendid, and prosperous motherland! Long live the Communist Party, which leads the people of the whole country in building a socialist society! Long live our lofty and great leader Chairman Mao!

    生活在新中国的民族大团结中
    ——载涛代表的发言
    我名叫载涛，属于少数民族中的满族，这次出席全国人民代表大会第三次会议，听到李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的报告和彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，对于报告的内容我完全同意竭诚拥护。
    开会以前，我去广东省，并且到海南岛视察，现在把我亲自看到一些情况和我的感想概括简短的向诸位代表报告。
    我这次出外视察，首先注意到各少数民族的生活情况和民族政策在地方的执行情况。
    在我国南方极边远的海南岛上，全岛人口约有260万人，这里包括34万多黎族，12万多苗族和其他回族、瑶族、僮族等几个人口比较少些的民族。以上这些少数民族居住地区土地面积约占全岛面积60％。解放以前岛上的少数民族住在所谓野人山里边，过着原始人类的生活，谈不到什么物质要求，更谈不到什么政治待遇。历年以来，曾遭受日伪军的迫害，国民党反动政府的侮辱，以前他们是隐身山谷，苟活人间。现在他们的生活大大的改变了，岛上通过居住少数民族高山区域的公路已畅通了，每天有班车到达海口和榆林。1952年，成立了黎族苗族自治区（现在是黎族苗族自治州），州长副州长分别由黎族和苗族担任，并且建设了自治州首府通什。那里有行政机构、干部学校、人民医院、师范学校、小学校、托儿所、供销合作社、国营百货公司、新华书店等等。我还访问过番茅高级农业合作社，完全是由黎族社员组成的。一切这些实际情形充分表现出各民族自治的精神，表现出政府如何尽力领导落后的少数民族迅速走上了繁荣进步的道路，证明了党和政府的民族政策的正确。
    我在广东调查了广州市的满族情况，该市满族约有2，000人左右，他们曾经饱尝了国民党反动政府的歧视和压迫，因而改名换姓隐瞒了满族成分，以求生存。解放后，学习了党和政府的民族政策，认识了真正的平等，真正的自由，才翻然醒悟，感激涕零，重新暴露了自己的民族成分。现今有在政府机关作干部的，有在学校教书的，并组织了满族子弟学校，小型手工业工厂等。满族妇女们也都积极参加各项劳动。一般都能振作精神，争取一同走上建设社会主义社会的道路。
    在广东我还参观了一些工厂，如国营纸厂，国营水泥厂，国营顺德糖厂，紫坭糖厂，国营顺德丝厂，公私合营麻袋厂等等。其中有的是新建的，有的是正在扩大建设中，都在按照规定计划生产，产量和质量年年有所改进。这些工业正在计划在最近的将来都有大规模的发展。
    关于广东的农业，我也参观了顺德农业合作社。广东在今年春耕以前全省参加合作社的农户已占全省农户总数的92％以上，预计今年秋收前可基本实现高级形式合作化。这可以说明广东的农业生产组织的进步正在突飞猛进中，农业生产的计划一定可以提前完成的。
    我们满族，生活在今日的新中国民族大团结中，向着光明幸福的前途和全国各兄弟民族并肩齐步的走上建设社会主义社会的大道，我本人十分兴奋的代表我们满族为永远和平建设光辉灿烂富强的祖国高呼万岁！为领导全国人民建设社会主义社会的共产党高呼万岁！为崇高伟大的领袖毛主席高呼万岁！
