Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang, June 2nd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Lizhong reports: The 540,000 mu of wheat in the Yellow River irrigation area of Henan Province, which is as tall as a person, is now golden. Harvesting has begun in the Xinxiang area. According to surveys in various places, this year's wheat yield is expected to increase by about 25% compared to last year. The 340,000 mu of cotton, which was planted earlier this year due to irrigation with Yellow River water, is growing neatly and vigorously.

This year's bumper wheat harvest is the fourth bumper year since water was diverted to the Yellow River irrigation area. In the past, this area was frequently flooded by the Yellow River, but since the People's Victory Canal was built here in 1952, news of bumper harvests has been continuously reported.

Since the full socialist collectivization of agriculture in this irrigation area this spring, the farmers' concern about occupying land for canal construction has been resolved. The entire irrigation area has not only expanded the irrigation area by more than 200,000 mu, but also straightened the winding canals. Within the existing canal network, more than 7,700 various types of canals, including main, branch, and distributary canals, have been repaired, as well as more than 900 bridges and many sluice gates. The irrigated area has been expanded by more than 200,000 mu within the old irrigation area. The area cultivated by tractors this year has also expanded from 80,000 mu last year to 240,000 mu.

Since the Yellow River Irrigation No. 3 Drop Power Station began generating electricity on May 1st this year, farmers in the irrigation area have ushered in a new chapter in their lives. This power station supplies electricity to three fixed pumping stations and five mobile pumping stations, enabling 55,000 mu of high land in the lower reaches of the Yellow River irrigation canal, which cannot be irrigated by gravity flow, to be irrigated by pumping machines. Moreover, one-third of the electricity is used as power for rural flour milling, oil pressing, and cotton ginning, and it also supplies electricity for lighting in 29 villages.

    引黄灌溉区小麦丰收
    据新华社新乡2日电　新华社记者张励中报道：河南省引黄灌溉区的五十四万亩齐胸深的小麦现在一片金黄。在新乡一带已开始收割。据各地调查，今年的小麦产量约比去年增产两成五左右。今年因为得到黄河水灌溉而提前播种的三十四万亩棉花，苗儿长得整齐旺盛。
    今年麦季丰收，是引黄灌溉区放水后的第四个丰收年。过去，这里是黄河经常泛滥的地方，但从1952年在这里兴建了人民胜利渠以来，就不断传出丰收喜讯。
    这个灌溉区农业自今年春季实现全社会主义合作化以后，解决了农民修渠怕占地的思想，全灌溉区不但新扩大灌溉面积二十多万亩，而且修直了弯曲的渠道，在旧有的渠道网内修整了干、支、斗各种渠道七千七百多条，还修了九百多座桥梁和不少闸门，在旧灌溉区内又扩大灌溉面积二十多万亩。今年拖拉机耕地面积也由去年的八万亩扩展到二十四万亩。
    引黄灌溉三号跌水发电站，从今年五月一日开始发电以后，灌溉区农民又揭开了新生活的一页。这个电站供给三个固定抽水机站和五个流动抽水机站用电，使引黄灌溉渠道下游不能自流灌溉的五万五千亩高地得到抽水机灌溉，而且有三分之一的电力被用作农村磨面、榨油、轧棉花等的动力，并供应二十九个村庄的照明用电。
