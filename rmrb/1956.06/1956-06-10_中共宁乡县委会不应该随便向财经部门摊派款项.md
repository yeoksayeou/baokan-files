To the Editor:

    The Ningxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province frequently violates financial and economic regulations by arbitrarily imposing apportionments on financial and economic departments. In the spring of last year, Minister Hu of the County Committee's Financial and Economic Department convened a meeting of various financial and economic departments, requesting everyone to contribute money to repair the bridge on the Mujiang River for automobile traffic. The various financial and economic departments did not have expenses for bridge repairs, so they separately requested instructions from higher-level authorities. Relevant higher-level authorities all disagreed, but the bridge had already been repaired, and in April, the County Committee specifically held a meeting to demand money, allowing each unit to haphazardly contribute a sum.

    In early February of this year, Comrade Li Xueliang, the Second Secretary of the County Committee, again convened the responsible comrades of various financial and economic departments to a meeting, stating that the County Committee had decided to expand the kindergarten and wanted each department to contribute money according to the number of people they employed. The supply and marketing cooperative was assigned the largest task, requiring them to contribute 850 yuan. At that time, the person in charge of the supply and marketing cooperative pointed out that there was no such expenditure, and Secretary Kong of the County People's Committee immediately said, "All state-owned enterprises are willing to contribute money, why are you in the supply and marketing cooperative unwilling to contribute?" The supply and marketing cooperative had no choice but to write a report requesting instructions from higher authorities. The higher authorities did not agree, so the supply and marketing cooperative insisted on not contributing this money. Afterwards, the kindergarten asked the supply and marketing cooperative for the money three or four times, but the supply and marketing cooperative politely refused each time, and the matter was dropped.

    In early March, the county decided to build a ring road around the city and again wanted to impose apportionments on various financial and economic departments. This time, the Town Committee of Chengguan of the Chinese Communist Party came forward to ask for the money, with the County Committee sending people to provide guidance. At the meeting, they first asked each unit to declare the amount of money they would contribute. Because the money for repairing the road should be paid from local financial expenses and should not be shared by various departments, no department was willing to contribute money. Therefore, the Town Committee and comrades from the County Committee took out the pre-prepared apportionment tasks, requiring the Grain Bureau to contribute 2,000 yuan, the supply and marketing cooperative to contribute 1,500 yuan, and other departments to contribute 300 yuan, 500 yuan, etc. At the meeting, some people pointed out that this was a violation of financial and economic regulations, and they did not accept this opinion.

    The Ningxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's practice of imposing apportionments in this way puts the financial and economic departments of this county in a very difficult position. If they contribute the money, they violate the state's financial system; if they do not contribute the money, the County Committee has objections. It is suggested that the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee put a stop to this erroneous practice by the Ningxiang County Committee.

    中共宁乡县委会不应该随便向财经部门摊派款项编辑同志：
    中共湖南宁乡县委会经常违反财经制度，任意向财经部门摊派款项。去年春季，县委财经部胡部长曾经召集各财经部门开会，要大家凑钱修理木井河通汽车的桥。各财经部门没有修桥的开支，就分别向上级机关请示。有关上级机关都不同意，但是桥已经修了，县委在四月间又专门开了一个要钱的会，让各单位胡乱凑了一笔钱。
    今年二月上旬，县委第二书记李学良同志又召集各财经部门的负责同志去开会，说是县委会决定扩建幼儿园，要各部门按人数多少出钱。供销社分配的任务最大，要出八百五十元，当时供销社的负责人提出没有这笔开支，县人民委员会的孔秘书马上就说：“各个国营企业都愿意出钱，为什么你们供销社不出钱呢？”供销社只好又写报告请示上级。上级没有同意，供销社就坚持不出这笔钱。以后幼儿园向供销社要过三、四次账，供销社都婉言拒绝了，这件事情才不了了之。
    三月上旬，县里决定修建环城马路，又要向各财经部门摊派。这次要钱由中共城关镇委会出面，县委派人指导。他们在会上先要各单位自报出钱的数目。由于修马路的钱应该从地方财政费用中开支，不应该由各部门分摊，因此没有一个部门愿意出钱。于是，镇委和县委的同志就把事先拟好的摊派任务拿了出来，要粮食局出二千元，供销社出一千五百元，其他部门三百元、五百元不等。会上有人指出，这样做是违背财经制度的，他们也不接受意见。
    中共宁乡县委会这样摊派款项，使这个县的财经部门感到很为难。如果出钱，就违反了国家财政制度；如果不出钱，县委会又有意见。建议湘潭地委制止宁乡县委这种错误的作法。
