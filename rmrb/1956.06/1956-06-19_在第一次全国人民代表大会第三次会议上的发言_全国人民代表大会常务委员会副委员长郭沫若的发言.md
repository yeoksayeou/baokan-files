Increased Scientific Expenditure in the National Budget – Steps taken in Natural Sciences and Social Sciences in the Scientific Perspective Plan – Cooperation between Chinese and Soviet Scientists – Conditions for Realizing the Scientific Perspective Plan – The "Hundred Schools of Thought" Policy is a Guiding Principle to Encourage Scientific Workers to Unleash Creativity – Is there a Conflict Between Formulating a Scientific Perspective Plan and the "Hundred Schools of Thought" Policy? – Striving to Make Arguments Better and Contentions More Effective

I have listened to Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Financial Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," and I deeply appreciate the stability of the national financial and economic foundation and the rapid progress of the national construction undertakings, which I believe are worth celebrating.

Taking the scientific expenditure within the social, cultural, and educational expenses as an example, we can see how sound our national finances are and how abundant the material conditions for developing scientific research are. The actual scientific expenditure in 1955 only accounted for 85.69% of the budget, which means there was a surplus. This has been the case every year since the founding of the People's Republic; the scientific funds have not been fully used for the past six or seven years. However, the budgeted scientific expenditure for 1956 has increased significantly: for the central budget, it has increased to 227.17%; adding the local budgets, it has increased to 253.27%. Previously, the scientific expenditure item was not included in the local budgets, and it was included for the first time in the 1956 budget. These situations fully demonstrate how much more importance the state attaches to the development of scientific research with the progress of construction undertakings, and how particularly high the enthusiasm of local areas is.

We can see the whole picture from this small aspect. Therefore, I personally believe that the 1955 national financial accounts and the 1956 national budget are very satisfactory. I personally express my full agreement and support.

Fellow deputies, I am a member of the scientific community. Please allow me to briefly explain the issue of how to develop scientific undertakings, which you are all concerned about, based on my personal experience and understanding at this conference.

In January of this year, the CPC Central Committee convened a meeting on the issue of intellectuals. In order to ensure that we basically build a socialist society within three five-year plans, it proposed to bring China's most urgently needed scientific departments close to the world's advanced level within twelve years, and encouraged everyone to march towards science. Intellectuals and young students across the country have been greatly encouraged; leadership institutions at all levels of the Party and government, democratic parties, people's organizations, fraternal ethnic groups, research units, teaching units, and production units are all demonstrating a high degree of enthusiasm to work together to achieve this glorious and arduous task.

To accomplish this task, we first reached a common understanding: that is, we must formulate a long-term plan for the development of scientific undertakings within twelve years. We cannot fight a war without a battle plan, and we cannot build without a blueprint. The long-term plan for the development of scientific undertakings in twelve years is our battle plan for marching towards science and the blueprint for scientific construction.

Twelve years is not too long a period. To complete unprecedented construction and research tasks within such a period, it is impossible to achieve the expected goals without an overall plan.

Therefore, under the leadership of the Party and the government, we are separately engaged in formulating long-term plans for natural sciences and for philosophy and social sciences. Under the direct leadership of the State Council, a Science Planning Commission has been specially established to lead the work of formulating scientific plans.

In formulating the scientific plan, the steps taken in natural sciences and philosophy and social sciences are somewhat different. In natural sciences, work started earlier, and it had already begun in December last year. The method was to invite more than two hundred outstanding senior scientists and technicians from across the country to Beijing to discuss together. First, we formulated dozens of important tasks that science and technology must undertake in the national economy within twelve years, and then we formulated hundreds of central problems that must be studied to achieve these tasks. For each central problem, its importance, international level, domestic situation, research content and progress, and the specific measures to be taken to achieve it, etc., should be briefly explained. Then, on this basis, a national twelve-year natural science plan outline is formulated. According to this general plan, each unit formulates more specific research plans related to itself. This is a method of combining and dividing, starting from a global perspective so that scientists can better integrate theory and practice and achieve appropriate division of labor and cooperation under a unified plan.

The work in philosophy and social sciences began in early February this year, and the method of large-scale concentration was not adopted. First, experts from within and a few from outside Beijing separately proposed important research questions and important works that must be written in various important subjects within twelve years. On this basis, a general philosophy and social science plan is summarized, which, in addition to important problems and important works in different disciplines, also lists several comprehensive important tasks; a comprehensive estimate is also made for cadre training and institutional establishment. This draft general plan and draft plan by discipline will be submitted to researchers in philosophy and social sciences across the country for discussion. After comprehensively collecting opinions and carefully considering the gains and losses, the draft plan will be finalized. This method can be said to be dividing and combining, but the spirit is consistent. The draft philosophy and social science plan, after a comprehensive discussion, also concentrates the collective wisdom of scientists, and in the process of drafting and discussing the plan, scientists have also gained a global perspective, enabling them to better integrate theory and practice and achieve appropriate division of labor and cooperation under a unified plan.

We lack experience in formulating scientific research plans, but the scientists in various departments participating in the plan have done their best. They are all honored to be able to participate in the formulation of the plan and have great hopes for the bright future of scientific development. Here, I should especially mention that the Soviet advisors and experts in China have given us great help. Especially in the formulation of the natural science plan, the Soviet government also specially dispatched more than a dozen experts from the forefront of scientific research in the Soviet Union to assist us in carrying out two months of hard work together. This is a landmark event in the creative cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientists that has historical significance. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government, Soviet scientists, and the Soviet people.

In this way, relying on the efforts of Chinese experts and with the assistance of Soviet advisors and Soviet experts, the draft scientific plans on both sides are nearing completion. Once the draft plan is completed and approved by the government, it will be implemented very quickly. Some particularly important and urgent projects can be submitted for approval in advance without waiting for the entire plan to be completed. Therefore, the long-term plan for scientific development is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of scientists, and once approved by the government, it will be the charter for scientific research in the next twelve years. This is something jointly created by scientists, and scientists have the responsibility to jointly abide by it and strive to achieve it. The twelve-year long-term plan mainly points out the basic direction of scientific development, and it is impossible to specify the methods for solving central problems or important problems too specifically. More specific provisions must be formulated separately by each unit in the future annual plans. Moreover, in the implementation of the plan, the plan itself will undoubtedly need to be continuously supplemented and necessary revisions will be made. However, after careful study and consideration, we believe that the basic direction and important steps for developing scientific research will not deviate too much. By following the plan, we can have a certain guarantee that we can complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and the government: to bring China's most urgently needed science and technology close to the world's advanced level within twelve years, and to serve the construction of socialism more effectively.

After having a scientific plan, there is even more important work, that is, to realize the scientific plan. The Party and the government will use tremendous strength to guarantee the full realization of the scientific plan, that is, to use tremendous strength to encourage scientists to unleash potential strength, expand the scientific research team, and ensure all the necessary material conditions for scientific research—increasing research institutions, enriching research data, strengthening publication work, promoting international cooperation, etc. Today, to realize the scientific plan, we have unprecedentedly superior conditions. There is an urgent need for large-scale national construction, strong promotion by the Party and the government, and selfless assistance from scientists in the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries. No matter how many central problems or important problems there are in the scientific plan, and no matter how limited the period for solving these problems and completing the tasks is, as long as all our scientists can exert a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, our scientific plan can be fully guaranteed to be realized.

Therefore, how to better enable scientists to exert a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity cannot but become a key issue in realizing the scientific plan. On May 2, Chairman Mao Zedong reminded us at the Supreme State Conference: we must realize the policy of "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" in academic research. On May 26, Minister of Propaganda of the CPC Central Committee, Lu Dingyi, gave a report on "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" to scientific workers participating in the formulation of the plan and important cultural workers in Beijing. Based on my own experience, I believe that "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is indeed the best guiding principle to encourage scientific and cultural workers to exert a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. We have already experienced the effect of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" in theatrical work. Thanks to Chairman Mao Zedong's instruction to theatrical workers to "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," our theatrical circles have truly presented a grand occasion of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" in recent years. Our "flowers" have not only bloomed all over China, but also almost all over Asia and Europe, and have even bloomed in the African region on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Our "flowers" are not only blooming a lot, but also blooming well, and are being sincerely appreciated everywhere. We must extend this correct guiding principle to all literary and artistic creation departments; and the "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," which is consistent with the spirit of this guiding principle, we must also extend to all academic research departments.

Since we want to formulate a plan, raise the level of scientific culture within twelve years, and serve socialist construction, and we also want to promote "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" and encourage free research and free discussion in academic research, some scholars believe that there seems to be some contradiction between the two. Some people think that formulating a plan will inevitably bind freedom, and conversely, some people think that rewarding freedom will inevitably despise the plan. But if we look at the problem from its essence, I don't think such a contradiction exists.

"Let a hundred schools of thought contend" has its times. Whenever social development reaches a epoch-making stage, a situation of "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" will always appear sooner or later in cultural activities. In China's Warring States period more than two thousand years ago, in my personal opinion, was the era when slave society transitioned to feudal society, there was a rise of various thinkers of the pre-Qin period. Our idiom "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" has been left to us from that era. In the early modern period in Europe, in the era of the transformation from feudal society to capitalist society, there was the "Renaissance" that originated in Italy; its form was exactly the same as the "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" in the Warring States period. However, the historical development stages of the two periods are different, and therefore, the cultural revolutions of the two periods reflected in ideology are not the same in essence. In today's "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" that we advocate, as far as I understand, is neither the rise of various thinkers nor the "Renaissance." The "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" that we advocate is, in more detail, a socialist competition in various academic researches, or a socialist competition in each academic research. We are not doing academics for the sake of academics, or doing research for the sake of research. Our clear general task is to build socialism. Therefore, our "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" is to promote our academic research and better serve socialist construction.

Therefore, our "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" not only requires arguing, but also arguing well; not only requires contending, but also contending well. Our "contention" has competition, but also struggle. We want to see which academic work or whose academic work is done more, faster, better, and more economically, that is competition. At the same time, we also want to criticize harmful ideas that violate socialist construction, that is struggle. To carry out academic struggle, we must adopt the method of free discussion, overcoming ideas with ideas, and overcoming theories with theories. We want to eliminate harmful ideas, not eliminate people with harmful ideas. People with harmful ideas, as long as they have no reactionary political actions, not only have the freedom to survive, but also have the freedom to discuss. If, through free discussion, harmful ideas are overcome or weakened, it will contribute to the development of academic undertakings and also contribute to socialist construction. Therefore, we not only require "contention and debate," but also require that the debates are better and the contention is better.

In order to make the debates better, and the contention more effective, that is, in order to make our academic work, whether directly or indirectly, better serve socialism, it is necessary for us to better study Marxism-Leninism, and better combine China's reality to apply Marxism-Leninism. There is no coercion to study Marxism-Leninism, it is based on personal consciousness and willingness. But a person who wants to contend and debate, and expects to debate well and contend well, then at this time and in this place it is naturally necessary to strengthen our conscious and voluntary study of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, advocating consciously and voluntarily strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism is not restricting "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," but better unfolding "Let a hundred schools of thought contend."

The formulation of the scientific plan is another practical application of Marxism-Leninism in China's reality. We have studied the laws of development of China's current society, and also studied the laws of development of science itself, so that the development of science adapts to the development of society, the development of science can be guaranteed; conversely, the development of society can also be guaranteed. Therefore, the spirit of the scientific plan is precisely to promote "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," rather than restrict "Let a hundred schools of thought contend." Naturally, in the plan, we have stipulated many central problems or important problems, which are mainly considered from the perspective of social development and national needs. In the state construction, the disciplines that are urgently needed but in our current domestic situation are missing or weak links, such as the research on the peaceful use of atomic energy, we must list them as key areas and concentrate more manpower and resources to develop them. The projects listed as key or central issues are naturally very important in national construction and scientific research, but this does not mean that the projects not listed as key or central issues are not important at all. No, that is not the case. The correlation between various sciences is very close. Key development requires comprehensive support. Conversely, the development of key areas can also drive the overall development. In a machine, an engine or a large gear is certainly important, and a small screw is equally important. If a small screw is missing, the operation of the machine will go wrong. From this, it can be seen that what researchers in various disciplines should strive for is not whether the topic they are researching is a central problem or an important problem in the plan, but whether their research can have good results and whether it can well serve socialism. Therefore, the formulation of the scientific plan not only does not restrict "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" at all, but provides more favorable conditions for "Let a hundred schools of thought contend." Between the scientific plan and "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," from the essence, there is really no contradiction at all.

Fellow deputies, my own experience in how to develop scientific undertakings is not deep enough and not comprehensive enough. But I must declare that the vast majority of scientists generally have the same views as I do. They absolutely support the formulation and execution of the scientific perspective plan and the policy of "Let a hundred schools of thought contend"; they all equally believe that there is no contradiction between the two, and everyone has great determination to fully exert their potential strength, improve their enthusiasm and creativity, strengthen unity and strive to cultivate new forces. Taking the Chinese Academy of Sciences as an example, the number of graduate students prepared to be recruited this year has increased six times compared with last year, and the number of mentors willing to supervise graduate students has also increased four times compared with last year. Everyone is preparing to carry out "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," and preparing to carry out socialist competition in academic work. In order to "debate" better and "contend" better, the vast majority of people are consciously and voluntarily strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, striving to absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and at the same time are also correcting the previous biases, and over-ignoring the useful achievements and experience of capitalist countries in academic culture. The vast majority of people have this common determination and belief: under the urgent need of large-scale national construction, under the correct leadership and strong promotion of the Party and the government, and with the selfless help of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, scientists must make the most intense efforts to complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the government. Within twelve years, China's science and culture will be raised to the international advanced level in certain important aspects, in order to support the great socialist construction undertaking.

Fellow deputies, finally, please allow me to make a sincere request to you on behalf of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese scientific workers, please give us guidance, supervision and encouragement regularly and continuously, so that our country's scientific undertakings can closely cooperate with the rapid development of national construction undertakings and leap forward by leaps and bounds.

    在第一次全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若的发言
    国家预算中科学支出数目的增加——科学远景规划在自然科学方面和在社会科学方面所采取的步骤——中苏两国科学家的合作——实现科学远景规划的条件——“百家争鸣”的政策是鼓舞科学工作者发挥创造性的方针——制订科学远景规划和“百家争鸣”的政策有没有矛盾？——为鸣得更好、争得更好而努力
    我听取了李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，具体地体会到国家财政经济基础的稳定和国家建设事业的突飞猛进，认为是值得庆贺的。
    单拿社会文教费内的科学支出一项来说，便可以看出我们的国家财政是怎样健全，我们发展科学研究的物质条件是怎样的充裕。科学支出1955年度的决算数只占预算数的85.69％，这便是说经费有了剩余。建国以来每年的情况都是这样，六、七年来每年的科学经费都是用不完的。但是1956年度科学支出预算数却又大量地增加了：就中央预算来说，增加到227.17％；加上地方预算，就增加到253.27％。以前在地方预算中没有列入科学支出这一项，1956年度的预算中才第一次列入了。这些情况就充分足以说明，国家随着建设事业的进展，对于发展科学研究是怎样的更加重视，地方上的积极性也是怎样地表示着特别的高涨。
    由这一斑便可以窥见全豹。因此，我个人认为1955年的国家决算和1956年的国家预算，是很可以令人满意的。我个人表示全面的同意和支持。
    各位代表，我自己是从事科学工作的一分子。请允许我在这次大会上把各位所关心的如何发展科学事业这一个问题，就我个人的体验和理解，简单地说明一下。
    今年一月中共中央召开了关于知识分子问题的会议，为了保障我们在三个五年计划之内基本上建成社会主义社会，提出了在十二年内使我国最急需的科学部门接近世界先进水平的号召，并鼓舞大家向科学大进军。全国知识分子和青年学生是感受到极大的振奋的；党和政府的各级领导机构、各民主党派、各人民团体、各兄弟民族、各研究单位、教学单位和生产单位都发挥着高度的积极性，要共同努力，来实现这个光荣的艰巨的任务。
    要实现这个任务，首先我们达到了这样一个共同的认识：便是必须制定一个十二年内发展科学事业的远景规划。我们要作战不能不有作战计划，我们要建设不能不有设计蓝图，十二年发展科学事业的远景规划，就是我们向科学进军的作战计划，和科学建设的设计蓝图。
    十二年不是一个太长远的期限，要在这样一个期限之内完成史无前例的建设任务和研究任务，没有一个通盘的筹划是不可能达到所期待的目标的。
    因此，在党和政府的领导之下，正分别从事关于自然科学的和关于哲学社会科学的远景规划的制定。在国务院直接领导之下，已经特别成立了一个科学规划委员会，来领导制定科学规划的工作。
    在制定科学规划中，在自然科学方面和哲学社会科学方面所采取的步骤是有些不同的。在自然科学方面，动手得比较早，在去年十二月就已经开始进行工作。办法是邀请全国优秀的高级科学技术人员一共二百多人集中到北京来共同讨论。先拟订十二年内科学技术在国民经济中所必须担任的好几十项重要任务，再拟订为实现各项任务所必须研究的好几百项中心问题；对于每项中心问题的重要性、国际水平、国内状况、研究内容和进度，以及采取怎样的具体措施来求其实现等等，要加以扼要的说明。然后在这样的基础之上再拟订一个全国十二年自然科学规划纲要。根据这个总的规划，各单位再分别制订和它本身有关的更具体的研究计划。这是由合而分的办法，是从全局观点出发让科学家们更好地使理论和实际结合，在统一规划之下得到妥当的分工合作。
    在哲学社会科学方面的工作是今年二月初开始的，没有采取大批集中的办法。先由京内和少数京外的专家们分别就各项重要科目拟出重要的研究问题和在十二年之内必须写出的重要著作。在这个基础之上再提纲挈领地归纳成为一个总的哲学社会科学规划，除学科别的重要问题和重要著作之外，还举出了若干项全面性的重要工作；对于干部培养和机构建立也作了一个通盘的估计。这个总规划草案和学科别的规划草案，将交到全国各地请哲学社会科学方面的研究人员进行讨论，在全面地征集意见并加以斟酌损益之后，使规划草案成为定稿。这个办法可以说是由分而合，但精神是一致的。经过了全面讨论的哲学社会科学的规划草案同样是集中了科学家们的集体智慧，而在草拟规划和讨论规划过程中也使科学家们获得了全局观点，能够更好地使理论和实际结合，在统一规划之下得到妥当的分工合作。
    关于科学研究规划的制定，我们是缺乏经验的，但参加规划的各部门的科学家们都尽了自己的至善的努力。他们都以能够参加规划的制定而感到光荣，并对科学发展的光辉远景抱着极大的希望。在这里我应该特别提出的是在中国的苏联顾问和专家们给了我们很大的帮助。尤其是在制定自然科学的规划方面，苏联政府还专门派遣了在苏联科学研究第一线上的十几位专家来协助我们，共同进行了火热的两个月的辛勤劳动。这在中苏两国科学家之间的创造性的合作上是一个具有历史意义的纪程碑。我要借这个机会对苏联政府、苏联科学家和苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。
    就这样靠着中国专家们的努力，在苏联顾问和苏联专家们的协助之下，两方面的科学规划草案都已经接近于最后完成的阶段了。规划草案完成之后，一经政府批准，就要很迅速地见诸实施。其中有些特别重要、特别紧急的项目，还可以不必等待到规划的全部完成，就可以提前呈请批准。因此，科学发展的远景规划是科学家们集体智慧的结晶，一经政府批准，也就是今后十二年内科学研究的宪章。这是科学家们所共同制造出来的东西，科学家们就有责任共同遵守，共同努力求其实现。十二年远景规划主要是指出科学发展的基本方向，在解决中心问题或者重要问题的方法上，不可能规定得太具体。更具体的规定要靠各单位在今后的年度计划中分别制定。再说，在按照规划实行中，规划本身不用说也会要不断地得到补充和必要的修改的。然而发展科学研究的基本方向和重要步骤经过了仔细的研究和琢磨，我们相信，是不会有多么大的偏差的。照着规划办事，我们就可以有一定的保障，能够完成党和政府交给我们的光荣任务：在十二年之内使我国最急需的科学技术能够接近世界先进水平，能够更有效地为建设社会主义服务。
    有了科学规划之后，还有更重要的工作，那就是要实现科学规划。党和政府是要用巨大的力量来保证科学规划的全部实现的，也就是说是要用巨大的力量来鼓励科学家们发挥潜在力量，壮大科学研究的队伍，保障科学研究所必需的一切物质条件——增设研究机构，充实研究资料，加强出版工作，促进国际合作等等。在今天要实现科学规划我们具有着史无前例的优越条件。有规模宏大的国家建设上的迫切需要，有党和政府的大力推动，有苏联和其它兄弟国家的科学家们的无私协助，科学规划中的中心问题或者重要问题尽管怎样多，解决这些问题、完成任务的期间尽管怎样有限，只要我们全体科学家们能够发挥高度的积极性和创造性，我们的科学规划是可以全部保证实现的。
    因此，要怎样才能够更好地使科学家们发挥高度的积极性和创造性，这就不能不成为实现科学规划的一个关键性的问题。五月二日毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上提醒我们：要我们在学术研究中实现“百家争鸣”的政策。五月二十六日中共中央宣传部陆定一部长更为参加制定规划的科学工作者和京内重要的文化工作者作了一次“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的报告。据我自己的体会，我认为“百花齐放，百家争鸣”确实是鼓舞科学文化工作者发挥高度积极性和创造性的最好的方针。“百花齐放”的效果，我们是在戏剧工作中已经体会到了的。由于毛泽东主席对戏剧工作者提出了“百花齐放，推陈出新”的指示，几年来我们的戏剧界真正呈现出了“百花齐放”的盛况。我们的“花”不仅开遍了全中国，而且差不多开遍了全亚洲和全欧洲，并且已经开到了地中海南岸的非洲区域。我们的“花”不仅开得多，而且开得好，到处都受到了倾心的欣赏。这个正确的方针，我们要把它推广到一切的文艺创作部门；和这个方针的精神相一致的“百家争鸣”，我们也要把它推广到一切的学术研究部门。
    既要制定规划，要在十二年内提高科学文化的水平，为社会主义建设服务，又要在学术研究中提倡“百家争鸣”，鼓励自由研究和自由讨论，有的学者们认为在这两者之间似乎有些矛盾。有的人以为制定规划便不免要束缚自由，反过来也有的人以为奖励自由便不免要轻视规划。但如果从本质上来看问题的时候，我认为这样的矛盾是不存在的。
      “百家争鸣”具有它的时代性。每逢社会发展达到了一个划时期的阶段，在文化活动中总要或早或迟地呈现出一个“百家争鸣”的局面。在我国两千多年前的战国时代，照我个人的看法，是奴隶社会过渡到封建社会的时代，就有先秦诸子的蜂起。我们的“百家争鸣”这个成语就是从那个时代替我们遗留下来的。在欧洲近代的初期，由封建社会转变到资本主义社会的时代，就有滥觞于意大利的“文艺复兴”；那在形式上也恰恰同于战国时代的“百家争鸣”。但是两个时期的历史发展阶段是不同的，因而反映在意识形态上的两个时期的文化革命在本质上也就并不相同。在今天我们所主张的“百家争鸣”，据我所了解，既不同于诸子蜂起，也不同于“文艺复兴”。我们所主张的“百家争鸣”，更详细地说，就是在各种学术研究中的社会主义竞赛，或者是在每一种学术研究中的社会主义竞赛。我们并不是为学术而学术，为研究而研究。我们的明确的总任务是要建设社会主义。因此，我们的“百家争鸣”就是要繁荣我们的学术研究，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    因此，我们的“百家争鸣”不仅要鸣，而且要鸣得好；不仅要争，而且要争得好。我们的“争”有竞争，也有斗争。我们要看那一门的学术工作或者那一位的学术工作做得更多更快更好更省，那就是竞争。同时，我们也要对于违背社会主义建设的有害思想加以批判，那就是斗争。进行学术性的斗争，我们是要采取自由讨论的方式，以思想来克服思想，以理论来克服理论。我们是要消灭有害的思想，而不是要消灭具有有害思想的人。有有害思想的人，只要他没有反动的政治行动，他不仅有他生存的自由，也有他讨论的自由。如果经过自由讨论，克服了或者削弱了那种有害的思想，那对于发展学术事业是有贡献的，对于社会主义建设也是有贡献的。因此我们不仅要求“争鸣”，而且要要求鸣得更好，争得更好。
    为了鸣得更好，争得更好，也就是说为了使我们的学术工作无论是直接或间接能够更好地为社会主义服务，那我们就有必要更好地学习马克思列宁主义，更好地结合中国的实际来运用马克思列宁主义。学习马克思列宁主义是没有强制性的，是要凭个人的自觉自愿的。但是一个人既要争鸣，而且期待着鸣得好，争得好，那在此时此地就自然有必要加强我们的学习马克思列宁主义的自觉自愿。因此，提倡自觉自愿地加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，这并不是限制“百家争鸣”，而是更好地展开“百家争鸣”。
    科学规划的制订是马克思列宁主义在中国实际中灵活运用的又一次实践。我们研究了中国现社会的发展规律，也研究了科学本身的发展规律，使科学的发展适应着社会的发展，科学的发展才能得到保障；反过来，社会的发展也才能得到保障。因此，科学规划的精神正是促进“百家争鸣”，而不是限制“百家争鸣”。自然，在规划中我们规定了好些中心问题或者重要问题，这主要是从社会发展、从国家需要的观点来考虑的。在国家建设上所急于需要而在我们国内的现有情况，又是缺门或者薄弱环节的学科，例如和平利用原子能的研究事业之类，我们就必须列为重点，集中更多的人力物力来加以发展。列为重点或中心问题的项目在国家建设和科学研究上自然都很重要，但这并不等于说：没有列为重点或者中心问题的项目就毫不重要。不，不是这样。各项科学之间的关联性是十分密切的，重点发展需要有全面支援，反过来，发展重点也就可以带动全面。在一架机器里面作为一个发动机或者大齿轮固然重要，作为一个小螺丝钉也一样重要。缺少了一个小螺丝钉，机器的运转就要发生毛病。由此可见，各项学科的研究工作者所应当争的不是自己所研究的题目是不是规划中的中心问题或者重要问题，而是自己的研究究竟能不能有好的成绩，是不是很好的为社会主义服务。因此，科学规划的制订不仅丝毫也不限制“百家争鸣”，反而为“百家争鸣”提出了更有利的条件。科学规划与“百家争鸣”之间，从本质上看来，实在丝毫也没有矛盾。
    各位代表，关于如何发展科学事业的说明，我自己的体会是不够深刻，不够全面的。但我须得声明一下，绝大多数的科学家们大体上都和我的体会有相同的见解。他们是绝对拥护科学远景规划的制订和执行“百家争鸣”的政策的；他们都同样地认为这两者之间并没有什么矛盾，大家都抱着极大的决心，要充分发挥自己的潜在力量，提高自己的积极性和创造性，加强团结并努力培养新生力量。拿中国科学院来说，今年准备招收的研究生人数就比去年增加了六倍，愿意带研究生的导师人数也比去年增加了四倍。大家都在准备着进行“百家争鸣”，准备着在学术工作中进行社会主义竞赛。为了“鸣”得更好，“争”得更好，绝大多数的人都自觉自愿地在加强马克思列宁主义的学习，努力吸收苏联和其他社会主义国家的先进经验，而同时也在纠正以前的偏向，对于资本主义国家在学术文化方面的有用的成就和经验的过于忽视。绝大多数的人都有这样共同的决心和信念：在规模宏大的国家建设的迫切需要下，在党和政府的正确领导和大力推动下，在苏联和其它兄弟国家的无私帮助下，科学家们一定要以最紧张的努力来完成党和政府交给我们的光荣任务。在十二年内使中国的科学文化在某些重要方面提高到国际先进水平，以支援伟大的社会主义建设事业。
    各位代表，最后请允许我代表中国科学院和中国科学工作者向你们提出一个诚恳的请求，请你们经常不断地给我们以指导、监督和鞭策，让我国的科学事业能够紧密地配合着国家建设事业的迅速发展而突飞猛进。
