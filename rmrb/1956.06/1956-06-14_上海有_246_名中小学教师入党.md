    Shanghai has 246 Primary and Secondary School Teachers Join the Party
    (Reported by our newspaper) From the beginning of March to June 9th this year, the district committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai have successively approved the applications of 246 primary and secondary school teachers to join the Party and accepted them as probationary members of the Chinese Communist Party.
    These teachers who have been admitted to the Party are all outstanding figures among the people's teachers who meet the requirements for Party membership. For example, Qian Kaiyuan of Huaihai Middle School has been teaching biology for twenty-five years. After liberation, under the cultivation and education of the Party, his awareness has been raised, and he submitted an application to join the Party in 1954. Jiang Shizhao of the First Central Primary School in Yimiao District, who has been engaged in primary school education for thirty-four years, has seen off twelve graduating classes, totaling more than 6,000 students, with students all over the country. In the past, she only cared about teaching and did not ask about politics; after liberation, she began to understand and love the Party. Through the education of the Party, she strived to overcome her shortcomings, improve her awareness, and actively strive to join the Party. Wu Ruyu of Changshou Road Primary School graduated from Shanghai Normal School in 1952 and embarked on the post of people's teacher. When she first started teaching, she encountered many difficulties because she had no experience. However, Wu Ruyu was not intimidated by the difficulties. With the help of the Party, she analyzed the characteristics of the children of workers she was responsible for educating, visited the students' parents, and strengthened contact with them. Finally, she cultivated the class she was educating into one of the best classes in the school.

    上海有246名中小学教师入党
    本报讯　从今年三月初到六月九日止，中共上海市各区委会先后批准了246名中小学教师的入党申请，接收他们为中国共产党候补党员。
    这些被接收入党的教师，都是人民教师中符合党员条件的优秀人物。如淮海中学钱楷元，二十五年来一直是担任生物学的教学工作，解放后，在党的培养教育下，提高了觉悟，在1954年就提出了入党申请。从事小学教育三十四年的邑庙区第一中心小学蒋师昭，在她手里送走了十二届毕业生，共达六千多人，桃李遍布各地。过去，她只管教书，不问政治；解放后，开始认识了党、并热爱党，经过党的教育，她努力克服缺点，提高觉悟，积极争取入党。长寿路小学吴如玉，在1952年毕业于上海师范学校，走上人民教师的岗位。她刚开始教学时因为没有经验，碰到过很多困难。但吴如玉并没有被困难吓倒，在党的帮助下，她分析了自己负责教育的工人子弟的特点，访问了学生们的家长，加强了和他们的联系，终于把自己教育的一个班培养成为全校最优秀的班级之一。
