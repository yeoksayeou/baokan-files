    Carefully and Gradually Reorganize Joint Public-Private Industries Economically

    To economically reorganize joint public-private industries so that their production can meet the growing needs of national construction and people's lives, and adapt to the requirements of further developing productive forces after changes in production relations, is an important task for these enterprises in the current period.

    According to the State Council's "Decision on Several Issues Concerning the Socialist Transformation of Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises and Handicraft Industries" on February 8 this year, all regions across the country have generally conducted preparatory work for the economic reorganization of joint public-private industries, and some regions have already made some adjustments. In some places, the adjustments have been relatively good, the quality of products in enterprises has improved, business management has improved, the potential of equipment has been utilized, and the enthusiasm of the workers has been unprecedentedly high. However, in some places, due to a lack of thorough investigation and comprehensive planning, factories have been blindly merged excessively, disrupting existing supply and sales relationships or cooperative relationships, reducing product varieties and quality, crowding factory buildings and equipment, and failing to properly arrange workers' food, lodging, and living conditions. Economic reorganization work involves the allocation of social productive forces, involves the relationships between industry and industry, industry and commerce, as well as public-private and labor-capital relations. Therefore, in carrying out this work, special care and prudence should be exercised, and it should be carried out with preparation, step by step, and in batches. Haste and simplistic methods should never be adopted.

    During the high tide of joint public-private ownership, many cadres developed the idea of large-scale factory mergers. After the State Council issued the "Decision on Several Issues Concerning the Socialist Transformation of Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises and Handicraft Industries," this idea has been greatly changed through inspections and corrections by local Party and government leading organs, but it has not been completely overcome.

    Some comrades believe that concentrating on large-scale production is socialism. They do not realize that the superiority of socialist enterprises should first be manifested in increasing output and quality, and improving labor productivity. Economic reorganization is a means of improving production, not our goal. If blind concentration cannot improve production under immature conditions, why spend so much time and energy to force concentration?

    Some comrades think simply from the perspective of ease of management, thinking that concentration is easier to manage. We know that management serves production. If we only one-sidedly demand ease of management but cause confusion in production, this approach is wrong. Moreover, the result of blind concentration and factory mergers will only lead to management chaos and will not achieve the goal of ease of management.

    Some comrades believe that small factories are dilapidated and have no potential to tap. Only by concentrating resources to increase equipment can production needs be met. However, the fact that production has improved in many factories has strongly refuted this "no potential to tap" argument. Facts have proved that after the realization of joint public-private ownership in the entire industry, due to the fundamental changes in the relations of production in enterprises, and on the basis of the high enthusiasm of the workers, labor productivity will increase correspondingly through enterprise reform and technological transformation. The idea of simply demanding the merger of small factories and increasing equipment without fully utilizing and exploiting the potential of existing equipment, and deviating from current possible conditions, is obviously not in line with the state's current policy of saving investment.

    Some comrades are fond of grandiose projects and believe that larger factories look more impressive. However, they have not realized that large-scale production is based on modern technology. The simple concentration of outdated equipment cannot truly achieve the goal of expanding production.

    Some comrades also believe that if economic reorganization is not carried out quickly after the realization of joint public-private ownership in the entire industry, the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses will be suppressed. This view is also incorrect. The realization of joint public-private ownership in the entire industry has powerfully stimulated the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. The task of the leadership is to guide this labor enthusiasm of the workers well into production, and to further consolidate and enhance the socialist enthusiasm of the workers through the continuous improvement of production. Blind mergers and rashly disrupting the original production and management systems and supply and marketing cooperation relationships will cause losses in production and frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses.

    Based on the actual situation of China's joint public-private industries and the work experience already gained in various regions, the current policy for economic reorganization of joint public-private industries should be to maintain the majority as they are and adjust only a small portion. That is to say, only a few need and can be merged at present. From a regional perspective, more factories generally need to be merged in large cities, fewer in medium-sized cities, and basically none in special districts and county towns. Most of the newly established joint public-private industrial enterprises are small factories, widely distributed from cities to townships. Each of their industries and even each of their factories has formed certain production characteristics, certain supply and sales relationships, and cooperative relationships in long-term economic activities. Their situations are very complex, and blind mergers will cause very bad results. In order to develop production, some factories need to be concentrated as necessary, but most factories do not need to be merged or do not need to be merged now. In particular, the industries in special districts and county towns have few industries and a small number of households, and most of them have developed to meet the needs of the rural economy, so there is generally no need to rush to merge them.

    The situations of small and medium-sized factories are very complex. In economic reorganization, different methods must be adopted according to the different types, scales, and characteristics of different factories, and uniformity must not be enforced. The reorganization work should be carried out on the basis of the original factory buildings, equipment, technical conditions, and the original supply and sales cooperation relationships, and everything must not be blindly disrupted. In large and medium-sized cities, for some manufacturing enterprises of the same type with similar process properties or connected process processes, after adopting measures such as balancing equipment, concentrating technical forces, and uniformly allocating labor in accordance with the principle of "large leading small and advanced leading backward," which can increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs, the method of centralized production and unified management can be adopted. However, in the process of merging factories, special attention should be paid to retaining the famous brands and famous products in joint public-private industries, retaining the colors and varieties, excellent craftsmanship traditions and special products that meet the needs of the people, and retaining the convenience stores for the masses and various excellent production and management systems.

    Most industrial enterprises should be handled in the following two forms: one is decentralized production and separate accounting; the other is decentralized production and unified accounting. In short, it is necessary to first unite, strengthen management, and then gradually carry out internal transformation of the enterprise. This method is suitable for the vast majority of small and medium-sized factories. Some enterprises need to be merged, but the factory buildings and other conditions are not yet available, so they can first adopt the form of unified accounting, partially centralized production, and partially decentralized production; wait until the conditions are met, and then further concentrate production. There are also some enterprises that are suitable for production in situ and independent operation, and should continue to retain the form of independent operation. In particular, for factories with repair, service-oriented nature, they should appropriately retain their decentralized production form as needed.

    Before carrying out economic reorganization, necessary preparatory work should be done. In the preparatory work, first of all, the basic conditions of equipment, technical conditions, supply and sales cooperation relationships, etc. of each industry and each enterprise must be investigated clearly, and then fully discuss with workers and capitalists to make plans for the selection of base point factories, the adjustment and installation of equipment, the establishment of production systems, the allocation of labor organizations, personnel arrangements, as well as dormitories, transportation, etc. Some places adopt the method of having private personnel put forward plans, the public side reviewing them, and the workers discussing them; since private personnel are generally familiar with the situation inside the factory and in the same industry, this can be adopted and is necessary.

    Economic reorganization is an extremely complex and meticulous work. In order to carry out this work with leadership and step by step, all regions should formulate plans for reorganization in batches and phases throughout the year; all industries should formulate specific reorganization plans so that ideological, organizational, production, personnel arrangements, and living welfare preparations can be made before reorganization. The reorganization plan should be reviewed and approved by the leading organs, and all blind, rash, and disorganized and undisciplined practices should be opposed. Party committees at all levels should strengthen the education of cadres, workers, and capitalists to ensure the smooth progress of economic reorganization work.

    慎重地从经济上逐步改组公私合营工业
    对公私合营工业进行经济改组，使它们的生产能够适应国家建设和人民生活日益增长的需要，能够适应生产关系变化以后进一步发展生产力的要求，是这些企业在当前时期的一项重要工作。
    根据今年二月八日国务院“关于目前私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造中若干事项的决定”，全国各地对公私合营工业的经济改组，一般都进行了准备工作，部分地区已经作了一些调整。有些地方调整得比较好，企业中的产品质量提高了，经营管理改善了，设备的潜力发挥出来了，职工群众的积极性空前高涨。但是，有些地方由于没有很好地调查研究和全面规划，盲目地过多地合并工厂，以致打乱了已有的供销关系或协作关系，产品品种减少和品质下降，厂房设备拥挤，职工食宿生活都不能很好地安排。经济改组工作牵涉到社会生产力的配置，牵涉到工业和工业、工业和商业，以及公私、劳资等各个方面的关系，因此，在进行这项工作的时候，应该特别小心谨慎，要有准备、有步骤、分期分批地进行，绝不能贪多图快，采取急躁简单的办法。
    在公私合营高潮中，许多干部产生了大规模合并工厂的思想。国务院
  “关于目前私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造中若干事项的决定”发布以后，经过各地党政领导机关的检查纠正，这种思想已经有了很大程度的改变，但是尚未彻底克服。
    有些同志认为，集中起来搞大生产才是社会主义。他们没有认识到，社会主义企业的优越性，应该首先从提高产量质量，提高劳动生产率上表现出来。经济改组是提高生产的手段，而不是我们的目的。如果在条件不成熟的情况下就盲目集中并不能提高生产，为什么要费许多时间、精力去勉强集中呢？
    有的同志单纯从便于管理出发，以为集中起来好管理。我们知道，管理是为生产服务的，如果只是片面地要求便于管理，却给生产造成混乱，这种作法便是错误的。何况盲目集中并厂的结果，只会造成管理上的混乱，并不可能达到便于管理的目的。
    有的同志认为，小工厂都是破烂摊子，没有潜力可挖了，只有集中起来增加设备，才能适应生产需要。但是，目前许多工厂生产提高的事实，已经有力地驳斥了这种“无潜力可挖”的说法，事实证明，全行业公私合营以后，由于企业生产关系发生了本质的变化，在工人群众生产积极性高涨的基础上，经过企业的改革和技术改革，劳动生产率就会相应地提高。那种不去充分利用和发挥现有设备的潜力，脱离目前的可能条件只是要求合并小厂、增加设备的想法，显然是不符合国家当前节约投资的方针的。
    有的同志好大喜功，认为工厂大一点，才像个样子。但是，他们却没有认识到大生产是建立在现代技术基础之上的，陈旧设备的简单集中，并不能真正达到扩大生产的目的。
    还有的同志认为，全行业公私合营以后，不很快地进行经济改组，会压制干部和群众的社会主义积极性。这种看法也是不对的。全行业的公私合营，有力地激发了广大工人群众的社会主义积极性；领导的任务就是把工人群众的这种劳动热情很好地引导到生产上来，通过生产的不断提高，来进一步巩固和提高工人群众的社会主义积极性。如果盲目合并，轻易打乱原有的生产经营制度和供销协作关系，生产遭受损失，反而会挫折群众的积极性。
    根据我国公私合营工业的实际情况和各地已经取得的工作经验，对公私合营工业进行经济改组，目前应该采取大部不动、小部调整的方针；也就是说，目前需要和可能合并的只是少数。从地区来看，需要并厂的，一般在大城市多一点，中等城市少一点，专区和县镇应该是基本不动。新公私合营的工业企业，绝大部分是小厂，从城市到乡镇，分布面很广。它们当中的每一个行业以至每一个工厂，在长期的经济活动中，都形成了一定的生产特点、一定的供销关系和协作关系；它们的情况非常复杂，如果盲目地进行合并，就会造成很坏的结果。为了发展生产，有些工厂需要进行必要的集中，但是多数工厂是不需要合并或者现在不需要合并的。特别是专区和县镇的工业，行业很少，户数不多，大多是适应农村经济需要发展起来的，一般更不必急于合并。
    中小工厂的情况是很复杂的，在经济改组中，必须根据不同工厂的类型、规模和特点，采取不同的办法，绝对不能强求一律。改组的工作要在原有厂房、设备、技术条件和原有的供销协作关系的基础上进行，不能盲目地打乱一切。在大中城市，对一部分工艺性质相近或者工艺过程相连的同一类型的制造性的企业，根据“以大带小、以先进带落后”的原则，采取平衡设备，集中技术力量，统一调配劳动力等措施后，能够提高产量、改进质量和降低成本的，就可以采取集中生产、统一经营的办法。但是，在并厂过程中，应当特别注意保留公私合营工业中的名牌厂、名牌货，保留适合人民需要的花色品种、优良的工艺传统和特种产品，保留便利群众的门市部和各种优良的生产经营制度。
    大部分工业企业，应该采取以下两种形式处理：一种是分散生产，分别核算；一种是分散生产，统一核算。总之，是要先联起来，加强管理，再逐步进行企业内部的改造。这种办法是适合于广大中小工厂的情况的。有些企业需要并厂，而厂房和其他条件目前尚不具备的，也可以先采取统一核算，部分集中生产，部分分散生产的形式；等到条件具备了，再进一步集中生产。还有一部分企业是适合于原地生产，单独经营的，应当继续保留单独经营的形式。特别是对于修配、服务性质的工厂，更应当根据需要，适当地保留它们分散生产的形式。
    进行经济改组以前，应该做好必要的准备工作。在准备工作中，首先必须把各行业各企业的设备、技术条件、供销协作关系等基本情况调查清楚，然后通过工人、资方人员的充分酝酿讨论，对基点厂的选择、设备的调整和安装、生产制度的建立、劳动组织的调配、人事安排以及宿舍、交通等等作好规划。有的地方采取由私方人员提出计划，公方进行审查，职工进行讨论的办法；由于私方人员一般熟悉厂内和同业的情况，这是可以采取的，也是必要的。
    经济改组是一项极为复杂细致的工作，为了有领导有步骤地进行这项工作，各地应当制定全年分批分期改组的规划；各行业应当制定具体的改组计划，以便在改组以前作好思想、组织、生产、人事安排和生活福利等方面的准备工作。改组规划应当经过领导机关的审查批准，反对一切盲目、草率和无组织无纪律的作法。各地党委应该加强对干部、工人和资方人员的教育，保证经济改组工作的顺利进行。
