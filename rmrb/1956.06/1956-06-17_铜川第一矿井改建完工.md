    Tongchuan No. 1 Mine Reconstruction Completed
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an) The reconstruction of the No. 1 mine in the Tongchuan mining area of Shaanxi Province has been completed and was officially handed over for production on June 15.
    In the past, the coal mining equipment in the Shaanxi area was very rudimentary. Most of the production processes were manual operations, resulting in low production efficiency, high labor intensity for workers, and unsafe production. Since liberation, many new and rebuilt mines have been established in the Tongchuan area. The No. 1 mine is one of the first to be completed. After expansion, the production capacity of the No. 1 mine has doubled, and machinery and electricity have replaced the heavy manual labor of workers in the production and transportation processes.

    铜川第一矿井改建完工
    本报西安讯　陕西省铜川矿区第一矿井已经改建完毕，在六月十五日正式移交生产。
    过去，陕西地区的煤矿设备都很简陋，生产过程大部分是手工操作，生产效率低，工人的劳动强度大，生产也不安全。解放以后，在铜川地区新建和改建了不少矿井。第一矿井就是最先建成的一个。扩建以后，第一矿井的生产能力增加了一倍，生产和运输过程中都以机械和电力代替了工人笨重的体力劳动。
