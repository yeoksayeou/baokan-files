Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 10th: Indian writers have sent invitations to writer representatives from various Asian countries, inviting them to a meeting in New Delhi on July 28th and 29th to discuss the convening of an Asian Writers Conference.

The Indian Preparatory Committee for the Asian Writers Conference said in a press release issued on June 6th: Invitations to Asian writers have been sent through the Asian embassies and writers' organizations in New Delhi. So far, the response has been encouraging. It is hoped that some prominent writers from China, Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, Japan, Vietnam, and other countries will be able to attend the preparatory meeting.

Some well-known Indian writers held a meeting in Delhi on March 25th to discuss the possibility of holding an Asian Writers Conference. The meeting decided that the attending writers would form a preparatory committee and absorb writers from various Indian languages. Since that meeting, many people have agreed to join the Indian Preparatory Committee.

The press release, signed by Mr. Ba·Da·Chaturvedi, a member of the Indian Parliament and a famous Hindi writer, stated that centuries of foreign rule in Asia have corrupted Asian culture and civilization, and the connections between writers in Asian countries "were severed under imperialist rule" and have only "begun to recover" recently. Therefore, Asian writers "need to gather together to analyze the causes of division and confusion among us, evaluate our respective cultural heritages, and create an atmosphere of tolerance and friendship so that new creative works can be produced and shared by all countries struggling for a new future of peace and freedom."

    印度作家邀请亚洲各国作家集会
    讨论创造友好气氛和新作品问题
    据新华社新德里10日电　印度的作家们已经向亚洲各国的作家代表发出请柬，请他们在七月二十八日和二十九日到新德里来举行会议，讨论召开的亚洲作家会议的问题。
    亚洲作家会议印度筹备委员会在六月六日发表的新闻公报说：给亚洲作家的请柬已经通过驻新德里的亚洲各国大使馆和作家组织发出。到现在为止，反应是令人鼓舞的。人们希望，中国、缅甸、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、日本、越南以及其他国家的一部分著名作家将能够出席筹备会议。
    一些著名的印度作家曾经在三月二十五日在德里举行会议，讨论举行亚洲作家会议的可能性。会议决定由出席的作家组成筹备委员会，并且吸收印度各种语文的作家参加。在这次会议以后，已经有许多人同意参加印度筹备委员会。
    由印度国会议员、著名印地文作家巴·达·查图尔维迪签字的这份新闻公报说，外国对亚洲的许多世纪的统治败坏了亚洲的文化和文明，亚洲国家的作家之间的联系“在帝国主义统治下被断绝以后”直到最近才“开始恢复”。因此亚洲的作家“有必要聚集在一起分析造成我们中间的分裂和混乱的原因，对我们各自的文化遗产进行评价，创造一种容忍和友好的气氛，使得新的创造性的作品能够产生，并且由正在为和平和自由的新的未来而斗争各国共同享受。”
