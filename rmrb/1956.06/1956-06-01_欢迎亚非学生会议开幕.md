    The Asian-African Students Conference, which has been in preparation for a long time, opened in Bandung, Indonesia on May 30th. Three years ago, Indonesian students proposed convening an Asian student conference, which was later expanded into an Asian-African student conference, and this initiative was warmly welcomed by the majority of students in Asia and Africa. Various student organizations in Indonesia and the broad masses of Indonesian students have made great efforts to prepare for the conference. President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian government have expressed great concern for the conference and have provided many conveniences and assistance for its convening. Leaders of many Asian and African governments and people from all walks of life have also expressed active support and encouragement for the conference.
    The statement of the International Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Students Conference pointed out that the Bandung spirit and the Bandung Declaration, which laid the fundamental foundation for the 1955 Asian-African Conference, are the path to establishing mutual understanding among all students in Asia and Africa. According to the spirit of the statement of the International Preparatory Committee, the purpose of this conference is: regardless of political beliefs, religion, and social views, to discuss the common problems of Asian and African students, to promote the interests of all students in Asia and Africa; and to promote mutual understanding, recognition, friendship, and cooperation among students from various countries. These purposes are entirely in line with the interests of the people of Asia and Africa and the cause of world peace. It is to be expected that this conference will make a positive contribution to strengthening the unity and mutual assistance of students from Asian and African countries, promoting academic and cultural exchanges between countries, and safeguarding the cause of world peace. The Chinese people and students wholeheartedly welcome this conference and wish it success.
    Asia and Africa are the earliest birthplaces of human culture. As early as thousands of years ago, our ancestors created a brilliant civilization on this land: astronomy, mathematics, medicine, architecture, literature, and art all had glorious developments. In this region of the world, schools and education systems were established and developed into complete systems very early on. As early as two thousand years ago, education in ancient China was already very developed. Al-Azhar University in Egypt, established in 970 AD, is the first university in the world. However, in recent centuries, the development of culture and education in the Asian and African regions has suffered serious setbacks and has long been in a state of stagnation. In modern times, Western colonialists invaded the Asian and African regions with warships and cannons. Along with
  “Western civilization” came greedy plunder and brutal massacres. Many Asian and African countries lost their national sovereignty and became colonies and dependencies, gradually losing the possibility of independently developing their own cultures. Their national cultural traditions were destroyed, their national history was distorted, their national languages ​​were suppressed, and education could not develop normally.
    Now, thanks to the arduous struggle of the people of Asian and African countries, countries with a population of 1.2 billion have gained their independence. Many other countries are on the road to independence. Broad masses of students who have been deeply oppressed by colonialism and are full of patriotism have actively participated in this struggle for independence and liberation. The people of countries that have gained national independence are eager to get rid of their backward state. In recent years, the economic and cultural construction of many Asian and African countries has achieved remarkable achievements, the number of schools and students has increased, and excellent national cultural heritage has been valued.
    However, many countries in the Asian and African regions are still under the rule of colonialists. Even in many countries that have gotten rid of colonial status, the harms and influences left by colonialism cannot be said to have been eliminated. This region is still relatively backward economically and culturally. The population of this region accounts for approximately 62.6% of the world’s population, while the current number of university students only accounts for approximately 22.5% of the world’s university students. Many countries do not even have a university. Illiteracy is widespread. As a result of long-term colonial rule, poverty and backwardness remain the common situation of many countries in our Asian and African regions today. Therefore, many of the problems faced by Asian and African students are common. They demand to promote mutual understanding, recognition, friendship and cooperation, and they all hope to contribute to promoting peace and easing international tensions.
    There are many things that China and many Asian and African countries can learn from each other. In recent years, with the joint efforts of relevant countries, cultural exchange activities between our country and Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and Myanmar, as well as many countries in the Middle East, Near East, and Africa, have greatly developed. Our country and many countries have exchanged visits by cultural delegations and art delegations; exchanged students with India, Indonesia, and Egypt; and exchanged professors with Egypt to give lectures. This kind of cultural exchange activity is also expanding and becoming more frequent among other Asian and African countries. It has greatly promoted the friendship and understanding between the people of various countries, thereby helping to maintain peace in the Asian and African regions and the entire world.
    The convening of the Asian-African Students Conference and the purpose of the conference are completely in line with the common demands of the people of Asian and African countries to strengthen mutual understanding and friendship, and are also completely in line with the wishes of the Chinese people to expand and strengthen friendly cooperation with the people of all countries. The strengthening of cultural, academic, and welfare cooperation activities among students from various countries that the Asian-African Students Conference seeks to achieve will receive the heartfelt support of the people of our country. Chinese students will unite with students from Asian and African countries, cooperate closely, learn from each other, and strive for the common progress and prosperity of our respective countries.

    欢迎亚非学生会议开幕
    经过长期筹备的亚非学生会议，五月三十日已在印度尼西亚万隆开幕了。三年前，印度尼西亚学生提出召开亚洲学生会议后来又扩大为亚非学生会议的倡议，得到了亚非各国广大学生的热烈欢迎。印度尼西亚各个学生组织和广大的印度尼西亚学生为会议的筹备工作尽了很大的努力。印度尼西亚共和国苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府对会议表示了十分关怀，并给予会议的召开以许多便利和帮助。亚非许多国家政府的领袖和社会各界人士也都对会议表示积极的支持和鼓励。
    亚非学生会议国际筹备委员会声明指出，为1955年的亚非会议奠定根本基础的万隆精神和万隆宣言，是亚非两洲所有学生之间建立互相谅解的道路。根据国际筹备委员会声明的精神，这个会议的目的是：不分政治信仰、宗教和社会观点，讨论亚非学生的共同问题，以促进亚非两洲全体学生的利益；促进各国学生之间的相互了解、认识、友谊和彼此间的合作。这些目的是完全符合亚非人民和世界和平事业的利益的。人们可以期望，这个会议对于加强亚非各国学生的团结互助、推动各国学术文化交流、维护世界和平事业将作出积极的贡献。中国人民和学生衷心欢迎这个会议，并预祝会议的成功。
    亚洲和非洲是人类文化最早的发源地。早在几千年以前，我们的祖先就在这块土地上创造了光辉灿烂的文明：天文学、数学、医药、建筑、文学、艺术等都有过辉煌的发展。在世界的这个地区，学校和教育制度很早就创立并发展为完整的体制。远在二千年前，古代中国的教育事业就已经很发达。在公元970年建立起来的埃及爱资哈尔大学是世界第一所大学。但是，近几百年来，亚非地区的文化教育的发展受到了严重的挫折，长期陷入停顿的状态。近代以来，西方殖民主义者用兵舰和枪炮侵入了亚非地区。随着
  “西方文明”带来的是贪婪的掠夺和残酷的屠杀，亚非的许多国家丧失了民族主权，变成殖民地和附属国，渐渐地失去了独立地发展自己文化的可能。他们的民族文化传统受到摧残，民族历史被歪曲，民族的语言文字受到压制，教育得不到正常的发展。
    现在，由于亚非各国人民的艰苦奋斗，已经有十二亿人口的国家获得了自己的独立。还有许多国家正在走上独立的道路。受殖民主义压迫深重而富有爱国热情的广大学生，积极地参加了这一独立和解放的斗争。获得了民族独立的国家的人民，迫切地要求摆脱自己落后的状态。几年来亚非许多国家的经济文化建设已经得到了显著的成就，学校和学生数目有了增长，优秀的民族文化遗产受到了重视。
    但是目前亚非地区许多国家仍然处在殖民主义者的统治之下。就是在许多已经摆脱了殖民地地位的国家中，殖民主义所留下的遗害和影响还远不能说已经消除。这个地区在经济和文化上仍旧相当落后。这个地区的人口占世界人口约62.6％，而目前大学生人数却只占世界大学生人数的22.5％左右。许多国家连一所大学还没有。文盲普遍大量存在着。由于长期殖民统治的结果，贫穷和落后仍然是我们亚非地区许多国家今天的共同处境。因此亚非学生所面临的许多问题是共同的，他们要求促进彼此间的了解、认识、友谊和合作，他们都希望能对促进和平和缓和国际紧张局势有所贡献。
    中国和亚非许多国家相互间可资学习的地方是很多的。几年以来，在有关国家的共同努力下，我国和印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸等东南亚国家以及中近东、非洲许多国家的文化交流活动有了很大的开展。我国和许多国家互相进行了文化代表团、艺术代表团的访问；和印度、印度尼西亚、埃及交换留学生；和埃及交换教授讲学。这种文化的交流活动在其他亚非国家间也正日益扩大，日益频繁。它大大促进了各国人民之间的友谊和了解，从而有助于维护亚非地区和整个世界的和平。
    亚非学生会议的召开和会议的目的，完全符合亚非国家人民加强彼此间的了解和友谊的共同要求，也完全符合中国人民希望和各国人民扩大和加强友好合作的愿望。亚非学生会议所要求获致的各国学生间文化、学术、福利等方面合作活动的加强，将得到我国人民的衷心支持。中国学生将和亚非各国学生团结一致，密切合作，相互学习，为求得我们各自国家的共同进步和繁荣而努力。
