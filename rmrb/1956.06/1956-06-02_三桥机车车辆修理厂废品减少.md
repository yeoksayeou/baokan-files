    Sanqiao Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Reduces Waste Products
    Responding to the call of the National Advanced Producers Representatives Conference, all employees of the state-owned Sanqiao Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory are actively finding ways to improve tools and operating methods. Since mid-May, production efficiency and product quality have significantly improved.
    The lumbering workshop is the workshop with the largest workload in this factory, and it also used to be the workshop with the most waste products. The yield rate of yellow pine drying process only reached 30% to 50%. Recently, the workers in this workshop learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and brother factories, and the yield rate has reached more than 90%. In the passenger car repair workshop, the interior wall panel assembly team used to take 220 minutes to assemble one square meter of interior wall panel. Recently, they improved the operating methods, and it only takes 130 minutes to assemble one square meter. Female welder Zhu Xinghua manufactured a brake shoe support, which doubled the efficiency of welding brake shoe supports and also reduced one worker who was supporting the brake shoe supports.

    三桥机车车辆修理厂废品减少
    国营三桥机车车辆修理厂全体职工，响应全国先进生产者代表会议的号召，积极想办法改进工具和操作方法，从五月中旬以来，生产效率和产品质量都有显著提高。
    制材车间是这个厂工作量较大的车间，也是过去废品最多的车间，黄花松木干燥工序的成材率，仅达到30％到50％。最近这个车间的职工学习了苏联和兄弟厂的先进经验，成材率已经达到90％以上。客车修理车间内墙板组装小组，过去装一平方公尺内墙板需要二百二十分钟，最近他们改进了操作方法，一百三十分钟就可以装完一平方公尺。女电焊工朱幸华制造了闸瓦托胎型，使电焊闸瓦托的效率提高了一倍，还减少了一个扶闸瓦托的工人。（本报驻西安记者）
