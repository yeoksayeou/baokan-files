Xinhua News Agency, 31st - On the eve of the "June 1st" Festival, over twenty thousand youths and children in the capital engaged in various festive activities at the Youth Activity Center and Children's Palace, among other places.

At the Beihai Youth Activity Center, the children held a grand campfire party. More than one hundred and thirty children were invested here with new red scarves. Beside the roaring campfire, Xi Ruojie, a little girl who had just received her red scarf, excitedly said, "Campfire, burn on! The hearts of us Young Pioneers are hotter than fire, and our red scarves are redder than flames." As the children's enthusiasm for dancing reached its peak, "Sister Moon" and "Little Star" suddenly appeared on the overpass. Little Star said, "Children, I want to play with you too, I want to wear a red scarf too!" At this, the children said in unison, "Come down!" So Sister Moon and Little Star, along with White Rabbit, Monkey, Giraffe, and others, descended from the blue sky and white clouds to congratulate the children on the festival.

The cypress trees in the Children's Palace were covered with colorful lights. Under the dazzling lights, the youths and children sang and danced to the cheerful sound of accordions. Many professional troupes performed acrobatics, ballads, and magic shows for them. Students from Liuli Temple Elementary School and Jiaodaokou Elementary School performed puppet shows. The children enthusiastically participated in various interesting games such as ribbon-cutting and fishing, and also held a stickball match.

The youths and children warmly received more than two hundred scientists, artists, advanced producers, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army at the Beijing Workers' Club. Children's literature writer Chen Bochui told the children the fairy tale he had recently finished writing – "A Secret," and a photojournalist captured the scene.

Li Fuchun, Cai Chang, Li Dequan, and other leaders of the government and people's organizations also came to the Beijing Laboring People's Cultural Palace tonight to celebrate with over ten thousand youths and children. They enjoyed the performances put on by the children themselves in the cultural garden.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st - The Capital's Preparatory Committee for Celebrating the June 1st International Children's Day held a reception for children's workers at the Beijing Hotel tonight. More than one thousand three hundred outstanding children's teachers, instructors, childcare workers, medical workers, and art workers from Beijing gathered together to spend this joyous evening.

At the reception, Wu Han, Vice Mayor of Beijing and Director of the Capital's Preparatory Committee for Celebrating the June 1st International Children's Day, expressed his respect and appreciation to the children's workers present, thanking them for their efforts day and night for the healthy growth of the successors to socialism and communism. Minister of Health and Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Li Dequan, also attended the reception.

The children performed artistic programs at the reception.
