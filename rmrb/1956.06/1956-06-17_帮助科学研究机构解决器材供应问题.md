    Help Scientific Research Institutions Solve Equipment Supply Problems
                           (I) Editor:
    Currently, many research departments across the country are actively engaged in various scientific and technological experiments. However, there is one problem in experimental work that urgently needs to be solved: the supply of materials cannot meet the needs of scientific research activities.
    Some experimental work requires certain metal equipment, most of which are materials allocated and distributed uniformly by the state. Because experimental work is not a mature technology, although it has a certain research plan, it often changes midway. It is impossible to prepare an equipment application plan in advance, especially when technical data is very scarce, and changes in the research plan are inevitable. At present, some material supply departments do not consider this practical situation and rigidly implement the system of allocating materials, which affects the smooth progress of certain experimental work and dampens the enthusiasm of some researchers. For example, our Salt Industry Research Office of the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, in order to study the actual evaporation of seawater and brine in salt fields, and based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, conducted a detailed study of the installation of iron evaporation ponds. We planned to design and manufacture the iron evaporation ponds ourselves before the salt production season arrived, so as to conduct experiments in a timely manner. However, after the design was completed, the manufacturing work was delayed because we could not get a supply of 1.8 tons of thick steel plates and 0.86 tons of angle iron. For more than five months, we have been running around negotiating in Beijing, Tianjin and other places for this indispensable material, but to no avail. Later, we finally borrowed the steel plates, and signed a contract with the Equipment Management Section of the Dagu Salt Field, entrusting them to manufacture it. However, because there was no angle iron, the manufacturing work has been in a state of suspension. The Tanggu District Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tanggu District People's Committee, in order to help us solve the problem of equipment supply, consulted with units such as the Xingang Shipyard, the Xinhe Shipyard, the Yongli Jiuda Dagu Factory, and the Delin Machinery Factory, and introduced us to the Tianjin Municipal Planning Commission for negotiation. We ourselves have also been to the Tianjin Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Light Industry, the Iron and Steel Department of the Tianjin Hardware Company, and the Tianjin Office of the Metal Recycling Bureau; but none of these units can solve our problem, and we are still running around. As a result, our experimental work cannot be carried out. This is very harmful to the work.
    We hope that some material supply departments should actively assist research units in solving the problem of equipment supply.

    The Shanghai Science Institute is a comprehensive research institution with many research projects. The amount of materials needed for research is not large, but there are many varieties, and some of them are needed temporarily, making it difficult to formulate annual and quarterly plans. As a result, many materials often cannot be supplied in a timely manner, which adds many difficulties to scientific research and affects the smooth development of research.
    The most serious problem is the supply of hardware materials. At present, the hardware materials needed by research units are handled according to the planned supply method. Regardless of the quantity, they must be uniformly allocated by the relevant departments and cannot be purchased from hardware companies. This often causes difficulties in our work. For example, when we were conducting instrument trial production work, we needed more than 20 specifications of materials such as hexagonal steel, copper coins, foreign coins, and high carbon steel in March, and the required amount of each material was very small. We negotiated with hardware companies and steel retail stores many times, but could not buy them. A certain instrument we are testing requires 47 small pieces of magnet steel, which were entrusted to a hardware and machinery manufacturing company for processing and manufacturing; after multiple official document negotiations since February, we finally had to apply to the central government for materials. Other equipment such as dehydrogenators, hydrolysis tanks, receivers, and acid addition tanks also cannot be manufactured due to the lack of materials such as stainless steel plates, copper plates, and steel plates.
    In our research work, we also often need a small amount of grain (such as rice, millet, wheat, soybeans, etc.) and edible oil (such as soybean oil, raw oil, rice bran oil, etc.). The amount of these things needed is not large, but the application procedures are very complicated and it often takes a long time to get approval. Sometimes, because the work is urgently needed, we have to take out our own food stamps and oil tickets to buy.
    In addition, currently, various processing factories in Shanghai require a plan to be submitted in advance when accepting work such as sand casting, electroplating, and wood mold making. Some temporary needs in research work often cannot find a place to process. This is also an unreasonable phenomenon.
    As far as I know, other research institutions also have opinions on the above issues. I hope that the relevant leading departments will take unified measures to solve them in order to ensure the smooth development of research work.

    帮助科学研究机构解决器材供应问题
                           （一）编辑同志：
    目前各地很多研究部门都在积极进行各种科学技术试验工作。但是，在试验工作中有一个问题迫切需要解决，这就是物资供应不能适应科学研究活动的需要。
    有些试验工作必需用一定的金属器材，这些器材大部分是国家统一调拨分配的物资。由于试验工作并不是已经成熟了的技术措施，它虽然有一定的研究计划，但是中途经常发生变化，不可能在事先编造好应用器材计划，特别是在技术资料十分缺乏的情况下，变更研究计划的现象更是不可避免的。目前，有些物资供应部门不考虑这种实际情况，死板地执行调拨物资的制度，因此影响了某些试验工作的顺利进行，挫伤了一部分研究人员的积极性。例如，我们轻工业部盐务总局制盐工业研究室，为了研究盐场海水和卤水的实际蒸发情况，根据苏联的先进经验，详细地研究了铁蒸发池的装置问题。我们准备在产盐季节到来以前，自己把铁蒸发池设计和制造出来，及时进行试验。但是，在设计完毕以后，却因为有一点八吨的厚钢板和零点八六吨的三角铁得不到供应，使制造工作耽误下来了。五个多月以来，我们为了这一点不可缺少的物资，在北京、天津等地到处奔走交涉，始终没有结果。后来总算借到了钢板，并且和大沽盐场设备管理科订立合同，由他们承制，但是因为没有三角铁，制造工作一直陷于停工待料的状态中。中共塘沽区委会和塘沽区人民委员会为了帮助我们解决器材供应问题，曾经找过新港修船厂、新河修船厂、永利久大沽厂、德林机器厂等单位来商量，并且介绍我们到天津市计划委员会进行交涉。我们自己也到过轻工业部天津供销办事处、天津市五金公司钢铁门市部、金属回收管理局天津办事处等单位；但是所有这些单位都不能为我们解决问题，目前我们还在继续到处奔跑。结果，我们的试验工作一直不能进行。这对于工作是有很大害处的。
    我们希望一些物资供应部门应该积极地协助研究单位解决器材供应问题。

                           （二）编辑同志：
    上海科学研究所是一个综合性的研究机构，研究的项目很多。研究中所需要的材料数量不大，但是品种很多，而且有一部分是临时的需要，不易订出年度和季度计划。这样，有很多材料就往往不能得到及时供应，因此给科学研究工作增加了许多困难，影响了研究工作的顺利开展。
    最严重的是五金材料的供应问题。目前，研究单位需用的五金材料是按计划供应办法处理的，不论数量多少一律要由有关部门统一调配，不能向五金公司购买。这常常使我们的工作发生困难。例如，我们进行仪表试制工作，在三月份需用六角钢、铜元、洋元、高炭钢等二十多种规格的材料，每种材料的需要量都很少。我们和五金公司、钢料零售商店多次交涉，都不能买到。我们试制的某种仪表需用小块磁钢四十七块，委托五金机械制造公司加工制造；从二月份起经过多次公文交涉，最后还是得向中央申请材料。其他如脱氢器、水解罐、承受器、加酸罐等设备也都因为缺乏不锈钢板、紫铜板和钢板等材料而无法制造。
    我们在研究工作中还常常需要用少量的粮食（如大米、小米、麦子、黄豆等）和食油（如豆油、生油、米糠油等）。这些东西的需要量不大，但是申请手续非常繁复，往往要花很长时间才能得到批准。有时因为工作急需，我们只好拿出自己的粮票、油票来买。
    此外，目前上海市各种加工厂在接受翻砂、电镀和制木模等工作的时候，都要求事先提计划。研究工作中有些临时的需要，往往找不到加工的地方。这也是一个不合理的现象。
    据我了解，对于以上问题，其他研究机构也有意见。希望有关领导部门采取统一措施来加以解决，以保证研究工作的顺利开展。
