Having listened to Secretary-General Peng Zhen's work report on the Standing Committee and read the compilation of documents from the Standing Committee meetings, I noticed the "Decision on Handling Japanese War Criminals in Custody for Crimes of Aggression Against China" passed at the 34th meeting on April 25th of this year. This decision is correct and wise, and I fully agree with and support it.

Undoubtedly, the Standing Committee's decision on handling Japanese war criminals is both stern and very lenient. Not only can the vast majority of Japanese war criminals in custody who committed relatively minor crimes, held lower positions, and showed remorse be exempted from prosecution and released to return to their country, but even the few who committed serious crimes and are brought to trial will receive lenient sentences. The recent judgments announced by our Special Military Tribunal fully embody the spirit of this resolution of the Standing Committee. The Special Military Tribunal not only did not sentence these people to death but also did not impose life imprisonment, merely sentencing them to fixed-term imprisonment of varying lengths. Even these few war criminals sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment may be granted early release in the future if they show good behavior. Such lenient treatment is a manifestation of the great breadth of mind and highly humanitarian spirit of the People's China. At the same time, it is in line with the interests of the Chinese and Japanese peoples and the interests of peace in the Far East and the world. Such an unprecedented event would have been unimaginable in old China; only the victorious Chinese people have the courage to do it.

It must be pointed out that although our judgments on Japanese war criminals this time are very lenient, they are made with great solemnity. They were all made after thorough investigation and fair trial. Not only were there complete testimonies and material evidence, but the defendants also had full opportunities to appeal and defend themselves. Such trial procedures are fully in line with international practice and international law norms. It is based on the spirit of humanitarianism and also takes into account the requirements of legal justice.

It is undeniable that the blood debts owed to our people by Japanese imperialists over the past fifty years are indeed uncountable. The crimes they committed in China are countless and beyond description. The long-term aggression of Japanese imperialists caused extremely heavy losses to the lives and property of the Chinese people. Leaving aside the distant past, just from the time Japan launched its full-scale invasion of China in 1937 to Japan's surrender in 1945, in these eight years alone, the loss of life suffered by our people was more than 10 million, and the property loss was worth hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars. In the six weeks after the fall of Nanjing in the winter of 1937, the number of Chinese people massacred, as determined by the Far East International Military Tribunal with conclusive evidence, was more than 200,000, all of whom were unarmed civilians, most of whom were elderly people, women, and children. All Chinese people who mention these appalling atrocities of the Japanese war criminals cannot help but gnash their teeth in hatred.

However, the matter is already more than ten years in the past! In these ten years, the international situation and Sino-Japanese relations have undergone fundamental changes. The Japanese war criminals currently detained in our country are not the main perpetrators who launched the Japanese imperialist war of aggression (they are not worthy of being called "Class A war criminals"), and during their long detention, the vast majority of them have had varying degrees of awakening and transformation. Under these circumstances, we can adopt a lenient approach to them. "Do not remember old grievances" and "treat people with kindness" are the traditional virtues of the Chinese people. What we adopt towards them is not narrow revenge but edification and reformation. The Chinese people have always opposed "subduing people by force" but advocated "subduing people with virtue." Only by "subduing people with virtue" can long-term results be achieved. China and Japan are close neighbors, and for the long-term interests of peace, we need to focus our sights on the future, not on the past.

Now the Chinese people have stood up and have become a strong bulwark of peace in the Far East, while Japan has been reduced to a semi-colony and military base of the United States. Therefore, the Chinese people should sympathize with, be friendly to, and help the Japanese people to strengthen their struggle against foreign military occupation and against militarization, and to strive for independence, democracy, and peace. We believe that this lenient treatment of Japanese war criminals will have a certain positive impact on strengthening this struggle of the Japanese people. Our handling represents the Chinese people's extremely broad-mindedness towards the Japanese people and their sincere desire to cooperate and coexist peacefully with them. This will be the most powerful and ruthless blow to the reactionary propaganda fabricated about the "threat of aggression from China" and "the Chinese people's hatred of Japan."

At the same time, these war criminals who have been leniently treated will have some impact on Sino-Japanese friendship and peace once they are repatriated. In fact, the vast majority of them have now improved their awareness. After organizing them to visit some factories, shops, schools, kindergartens, nursing homes, agricultural cooperatives, and water conservancy projects in Shenyang, Fushun, Taiyuan, Beijing, and nearby rural areas, they saw the tremendous achievements of China's construction and the Chinese people's broad-mindedness of "not blaming the past," and were greatly moved and generally responded well. Some people said: "Some things in New China are really generous, and they care about us so much, which makes me respect New China even more. It would be inhuman to have aggressive thoughts again." Some people said: "The Chinese people are trying everything possible to make us new people, this kind of care is really great, and I must stand up and be a new person from now on." Some people also said: "The aggressive war that destroys peace is so inhuman and hinders social development. I am determined to strive to be a peace fighter and defend peace." There are many expressions like this, too numerous to mention. After my Special Military Tribunal recently announced its judgments, those who were sentenced to prison all expressed that they would work hard to reform themselves and become new people. As for the many who were exempted from prosecution and released to return to their country, most of them expressed that they would work hard to oppose war and promote Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, in general, taking lenient measures towards these people will not only not bring any harm to enhancing Sino-Japanese friendship and safeguarding peace in the Far East, but will also produce a certain positive impact. At the same time, this kind of handling will also have a certain positive impact on further easing the international situation and further cracking down on war conspiracies.

### 宽大处理日本战争犯罪分子是中国人  民伟大胸襟和高度人道主义的表现——梅汝璈代表的发言

    宽大处理日本战争犯罪分子是中国人民伟大胸襟和高度人道主义的表现
    ——梅汝璈代表的发言
    听了彭真秘书长关于常务委员会的工作报告和读了常务委员会会议的文件汇辑，我注意到今年四月二十五日第三十四次会议所通过的“关于处理在押日本侵略中国战争中战争犯罪分子的决定”。这个决定是正确的、英明的，我完全同意和拥护。
    毫无疑义，常委会这个决定对于日本战争犯罪分子的处理是严正的，同时也是十分宽大的。不但对于极大部分在押的日本战争犯罪分子中罪行较轻，职位较低和悔罪表现较好的可以免予起诉、释放回国，而且就是那少数罪行严重、交付审判的分子也将获得从宽判处。我国特别军事法庭最近宣布的判决完全体现了常委会这个决议的精神。特别军事法庭对这些人不但没有判处死刑，而且也没有判处无期徒刑，仅仅对他们判处了不同年限的有期徒刑。就是这少数被判处有期徒刑的战争犯罪分子，如果有良好的表现，将来也可以获得提前释放。这样宽大的处理是人民中国伟大胸襟和高度人道主义精神的表现。同时，它也是符合中日两国人民的利益和远东及世界和平的利益的。这种史无前例的事情在旧中国是不可能设想的，只有胜利了的中国人民才有气魄做得出来。
    必须指出，我们这次对日本战争犯罪分子的判决虽是十分宽大的，但是它们的作出却是十分郑重的。它们都是经过缜密的侦查、公正的审讯才作出的。不但人证物证俱全，而且被告都获有充分申诉和辩护的机会。这样的审判程序是完全符合国际惯例和国际法准则的。它是本着人道主义的精神，同时也照顾到法律正义的要求的。
    毋庸讳言，五十年来日本帝国主义者对我国人民所欠下的血债确实是算不清的。他们在中国所犯的罪行是数不胜数、书不胜书的。日本帝国主义者的长期侵略，使中国人民的生命财产遭受着极其惨重的损失。远的且不谈，只就1937年日本发动全面侵华战争起到1945年日本投降止，仅在这八年之中，我国人民所遭受的生命损失便在1，000万人以上，财产损失价值达数百亿美元。在1937年冬南京沦陷后六个星期里，经远东国际军事法庭认为证据确凿、有案可稽的被屠杀的中国人民已在20万人以上，全部都是手无寸铁的平民，其中大多数是老年人、妇女和儿童。对日本战争罪犯们的这些骇人听闻的暴行，中国人提起了是没有不切齿痛恨的。
    但是，事情已经过去十年以上了！在这十年中，国际局势和中日关系已经起了根本的变化。现在在我国羁押的日本战犯并不是发动日本帝国主义侵略战争的主要责任者（他们还配不上称为“甲级战犯”），而且他们在长期羁押期间，极大多数都有不同程度的觉悟和转变。在这种情形之下，我们是可以对他们采取宽大处理的。“不念旧恶”、“与人为善”是中国人民的传统美德。我们对他们采取的不是狭隘的报复而是感化和改造。中国人一向是反对“以力服人”而是主张“以德服人”的。惟有“以德服人”，才能收效长远。中国和日本是近邻，为了和平的长远利益，需要我们把视线重点放在未来，而不要放在过去。
    现在中国人民已经站起来了，并且成了远东和平的坚强堡垒，而日本却已沦为美国的半殖民地和军事基地，因此，中国人民对日本人民应该同情、友好，帮助日本人民去加强他们反对外国军事占领和反对军国主义化，以及争取独立、民主、和平的斗争。我们相信，这次对日本战争犯罪分子的宽大处理对于加强日本人民的这种斗争是会发生一定有利影响的。我们这种处理表示着中国人民对日本人民的极端旷达的胸怀和愿意同他们友好合作、和平共处的真诚愿望。这对于反动派所虚构的“来自中国的侵略威胁”以及“中国人民仇视日本”一类的无稽宣传将是一个最有力最无情的打击。
    同时，这些受到宽大处理的战争罪犯们一旦被遣送回国之后，对于中日友好和平是会发生一些影响的。事实上，现在他们大多数的觉悟都已经提高了。在组织他们参观了沈阳、抚顺、太原、北京和附近农村的一些工厂、商店、学校、幼儿园、养老院、农业合作社和水利建设之后，他们看到中国建设的巨大成就和中国人民“不咎既往”的宽大胸襟，都受了很大的感动、反映普遍良好。有的人说：“新中国的一些事情真是大方，对我们这样关心，使我更加尊敬新中国，再要有侵略思想就不是人了。”有的人说：“中国人民想一切办法使我们重新作人，这种关怀真是伟大，今后一定要站起来重做新人。”有的人还说：“破坏和平的侵略战争是多么惨无人道，同时阻碍了社会发展。我决心争取做一个和平战士，保卫和平。”像这一类的表示是很多的，不胜枚举。在我特别军事法庭最近宣判之后，那些被判徒刑的都表示要努力改造自己、重新作人。至于那许多免予起诉、释放回国的，大都表示要努力反对战争、促进中日友好。所以，总的说来，对这些人采取宽大措施，对于增进中日友好和保卫远东和平不但不会带来丝毫损害，而且会产生一定有利的影响。同时，这样处理对于进一步和缓国际局势和进一步地打击战争阴谋，也会产生一定有利的影响。
