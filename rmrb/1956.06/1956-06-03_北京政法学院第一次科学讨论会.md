    The First Scientific Discussion Meeting of Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law
    The Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law held its first scientific discussion meeting on May 27th. A total of nine papers were discussed at the meeting.
    Professor Wu Enyu's "The Question of the Origin of the Chinese State" was one of the nine papers discussed at the plenary session. Wu Enyu proved that the Xia Dynasty was the black pottery culture of the late Neolithic Age, and on this premise, combined with legends on the ground and relics underground, inferred from the development of production that the Xia people had not yet established a state. It was not until Jie of the Tang Dynasty that the Shang tribal aristocracy, headed by Tang, established the first state in China. Speakers unanimously agreed that solving the question of the origin of the Chinese state is very important. As for the above conclusion, Comrade Yin Da of the Chinese Academy of Sciences believes that "it is reasonable to talk about the origin of our country's state from the Yin Dynasty." Professor Zhang Zhenglang of Peking University and others believe that the productivity of the Yin and Shang Dynasties was already very developed, and Chinese culture has proven not to be foreign, so it is very likely that a state had already emerged before the Shang Dynasty.

    北京政法学院第一次科学讨论会
    北京政法学院五月二十七日举行了第一次科学讨论会。全会共讨论了九篇论文。
    吴恩裕教授的“中国国家起源问题”是全会上讨论的九篇论文中的一篇。吴恩裕证明夏时代是新石器时代末期的黑陶文化，并且在这一前提之下，结合地上的传说和地下的遗物，从生产的发展来推论夏族还没有建立国家。汤代桀以后以汤为首的商部落贵族才在中国建立了第一个国家。发言者一致认为中国国家起源问题的解决很重要。至于上述的结论，中国科学院尹达同志认为“就殷代谈我国国家起源问题，肯定地讲是有道理的”。北京大学张政烺教授等则认为殷商的生产力已很发达，而中国的文化已经证明不是外来的，因此很有可能在商之前已经产生了国家。　（张鑫）
