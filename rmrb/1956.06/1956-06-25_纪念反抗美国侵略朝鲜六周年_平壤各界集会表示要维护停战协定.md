Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 24th: More than 800 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a rally at the Moranbong Theater this evening to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the Korean people's resistance against American imperialist aggression on "June 25th."

Among those attending the rally were Korean Workers' Party and state leaders Kim Tu-bong, Choi Yong-kun, Kim Il, and responsible persons from various democratic parties and social organizations, as well as generals and cadres of the Korean People's Army.

The Chinese People's Volunteers delegation, headed by Luo Libin, Cao Keqiang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and diplomatic envoys to Korea from various countries were also invited to attend the rally.

Korean People's Army Lieutenant General Jang Pyong-san delivered a report at the meeting. He said that since the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently and strictly abided by the armistice agreement. The Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn some of their forces, and recently the Korean People's Army has also reduced its forces by 80,000 men. However, the United States has recently further and frantically attempted to undermine the Korean armistice agreement, unilaterally announcing the suspension of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's work, and instigating the Syngman Rhee clique to clamor for a "northern advance." He concluded by saying that we must heighten our vigilance, strengthen the Korean People's Army, defend the democratic base in the northern part of the Republic, thwart the war schemes of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, and fight for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Luo Libin, head of the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation, then spoke at the rally. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteers are determined to maintain high vigilance together with the Korean People's Army, strictly guard our positions, and continue to strive to safeguard the implementation of the Korean armistice agreement, to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    纪念反抗美国侵略朝鲜六周年
    平壤各界集会表示要维护停战协定
    新华社平壤24日电　平壤市各界八百多人今天晚间在牡丹峰剧场举行大会，纪念“六·二五”朝鲜人民反抗美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜六周年。
    参加大会的有朝鲜劳动党和国家领导人金枓奉、崔庸健、金一和各民主政党、社会团体的负责人、朝鲜人民军将领和干部。
    以罗立斌为首的中国人民志愿军代表团、中国驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办曹克强和各国驻朝使节也应邀参加了大会。
    朝鲜人民军中将张平山在会上作了报告。他说，朝鲜停战以后，朝中方面一贯严格遵守停战协定，中国人民志愿军撤走了一部分兵力，最近朝鲜人民军又裁减兵力八万人。但是美国最近却进一步疯狂地企图破坏朝鲜停战协定，片面宣布停止中立国视察小组的工作，唆使李承晚集团叫嚣“北进”。他最后说，我们要提高警惕，加强朝鲜人民军，保卫共和国北部的民主基地，粉碎美国和李承晚集团的战争阴谋，为和平统一朝鲜而斗争。
    中国人民志愿军代表团团长罗立斌接着在大会上讲话。他说，中国人民志愿军决心和朝鲜人民军一起保持高度警惕，严守阵地，为维护朝鲜停战协定的实施，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为保卫远东和世界和平而继续奋斗。
