Found the Path to "Walking Ahead of the Masses"
    Lü Jianzhong

When Comrade Li Jinghe, the Secretary of the Shuangcheng County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, asked me what issues I needed to understand, I first asked him to talk about whether the leadership work of the County Party Committee had changed from "being dragged by the masses" to "getting ahead of the masses" after the county achieved complete socialist agricultural collectivization.

I raised this question because Comrade Li Jinghe had made a self-criticism of the County Party Committee's repeated lagging behind the masses in his speech at the Heilongjiang Provincial Rural Work Conference in late January this year. The County Party Committee had committed the mistake of "bound feet walking" during the leadership of the elementary cooperative movement. Later, after studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," its thinking was raised a step, and it proposed a plan to achieve advanced cooperativization throughout the county by the autumn of 1958. However, the County Party Committee did not anticipate that the high tide of the advanced cooperativization movement would rapidly spread throughout the county in just two months. Therefore, Comrade Li Jinghe made a self-criticism on behalf of the County Party Committee at the conference. At the same time, he also foresaw that a production high tide would inevitably follow the high tide of complete socialist cooperativization. Therefore, he proposed that the county's total grain output in 1956 should be increased by 20% compared with the planned output in 1955. The main measures to increase production were to dig 6,000 wells throughout the county and to fertilize 80% of the land area.

It should be said that Comrade Li Jinghe showed considerable courage when he put forward such a production increase target at that time, because the farmers in Shuangcheng County had never had the habit of digging wells for irrigation. At the same time, because there was a lot of land, farmers rarely applied manure to the land in the past.

But when Comrade Li Jinghe answered my question, he said with emotion: "We have fallen behind the masses again! However, this time we have found the path, and we can catch up."

Then he talked to me in detail about the socialist enthusiasm shown by the county's farmers in the production increase movement and his own experiences.

The county originally planned to dig 1,300 wells this spring. This was a major event, and from the beginning, the County Party Committee and the District Party Committees sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to lead this work. Li Jinghe also went to the countryside. He found that the County Party Committee's work teams and the District Party Committees had two different viewpoints and practices when mobilizing the masses to formulate well-digging plans. In the Jinhua District, many cadres went to the countryside with a feeling of fear of difficulty. They did not have the courage to raise the well-digging task to the masses. They only found a few well diggers to "study." The well diggers said that digging wells was not a simple matter. There were only seven people in the district who knew how to dig wells. It would take 20 days to dig one well. There were fifteen villages in the district, and digging five wells in each village would take 100 days. At the same time, the wages of well diggers were relatively high, and there were many difficulties in preparing materials. After calculating, the district could only dig 65 wells by the end of June, far from meeting the requirements of the County Party Committee. The work team was helpless and felt that this was the only way to do it. It was not until they learned from the experience of the Handian District that they went to mobilize the masses.

After the cadres of the Handian District went to the countryside, they adopted a different attitude. When they consulted with the masses, the masses also raised a lot of questions. In addition to the difficulties in technology and materials, the masses also doubted whether digging wells was really useful, how much land a well could irrigate, and what methods to use to irrigate, etc. The cadres were not confused by the difficulties and doubts raised by the masses. They carefully observed and explored a question, that is, whether the masses raised so many concerns to show that they did not understand well digging, or to show that they urgently needed to dig wells? They analyzed various situations: Shuangcheng County was short of water, and drought often affected planting. Soybeans also often failed to pod due to lack of rain during flowering. Therefore, production had not increased much in recent years, and the vast number of farmers had been worried about this matter. After the county achieved advanced cooperativization, the farmers even more strongly demanded to change this situation and strive for a large increase in production. Digging wells was one of the fundamental measures to solve the problem of increasing production, and therefore it should be the fundamental requirement of the vast number of farmers. At the same time, they also noticed that while the farmers had concerns about digging wells, they were enthusiastically doing experiments. If they didn't have materials, they collected them from house to house; if they didn't have well diggers, they learned to do it themselves. Once water came out of the bottom of the well, they were so happy that they sang and shouted. The cadres determined that as long as there was leadership, the farmers were willing to dig wells. They then cultivated typical examples, trained technical personnel, and calculated the cost and benefits of digging wells to carry out publicity and mobilization among the farmers. After a series of work, a vigorous well-digging movement was launched throughout the district. The well-digging target of the whole district was repeatedly broken by the masses—from 112 wells to 213 wells. The technical problems and material problems that everyone had been worried about were solved by the masses. Those who did not understand technology learned technology, and those who did not have materials took out their own wood.

The County Party Committee vigorously organized all districts to learn from the experience of the Handian District. By early May, 2,628 wells had been dug throughout the county, more than double the spring plan.

The county's manure accumulation movement was also like this. In the beginning, many cadres did not understand the demands of the farmers. After achieving advanced cooperativization, the farmers more urgently demanded to work more and increase production. However, there was too little production content in the cooperatives, and a large number of laborers could not find a way out. This demand of the farmers was the best condition for solving the problem of manure accumulation. But what about the cadres? They pinned their hopes on state loans. If the loan problem could not be solved, they reduced the amount of manure accumulation and cut production content. As for whether the production increase plan could be realized and how to realize it, they had no idea. Later, the masses in Zhou Qi and Zhou Yuan villages in Zhoujia District spontaneously put forward the slogan "Apply manure to every mu, do not plant without manure," and found many sources of manure. This matter attracted the attention of the County Party Committee, and a work team was immediately sent to investigate and experiment, and more than 20 kinds of manure sources were found. In this way, the masses all started working. The whole county quickly set off an unprecedented "full manure movement." As a result, more than 90% of the agricultural cooperatives in the county achieved the goal of applying 100,000 jin of manure per mu during the spring sowing.

These moving facts have given the leading cadres and general staff of the Shuangcheng County Committee extremely profound education. Li Jinghe said with emotion: "After the realization of advanced cooperativization, it is really difficult to estimate how much potential there is for the vast masses to increase production. It seems that overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking is not such a simple matter. However, the problem lies in what attitude we take towards it. Are we content with this state of repeatedly lagging behind the masses, or are we trying to find ways to catch up? In the past, we also knew that the relations of production had changed and the productive forces had been liberated, but that was learned from documents, that was just a concept. As for where the socialist enthusiasm of the masses is expressed and how to fully rely on and give play to their enthusiasm, only by truly contacting reality, only by going deep into the masses, can this problem be concretized in the mind, can one have confidence and courage when leading the masses forward."

Comrade Li Jinghe's valuable experience has solved a problem in my mind that has not been solved. During this period of time, the rural work comrades I came into contact with, many of them were full of vigor and stood in front of the masses to lead them forward; but there were also some people who often praised the labor enthusiasm of the masses and had infinite emotion when they mentioned it; but when every plan they made was repeatedly broken through by the masses, they did not explore the reasons, nor did they think about how much production potential was buried in their hands, but only said lightly: "Hey, lagging behind again," and that was the end of it. It seemed that this was an inevitable thing under the new situation, and therefore they were at ease. In Shuangcheng County, I once talked about this issue with comrades from a work team, and they all agreed that this kind of person who is content with "lagging behind again" is indeed not an isolated case. But how can one not fall behind the masses? At that time, no clear answer had been obtained. Now, judging from Comrade Li Jinghe's experience, there is no mystery in this, the problem still needs to be solved by going to the masses. As Li Jinghe himself experienced: as long as you truly go deep into the masses, listen to what they really want, see where their enthusiasm is expressed, you will have a bottom in your heart, you can find a way to lead them forward, and you will have the courage to lead.

    找到了“走在群众前头”的门径
    吕建中
    当中共双城县委书记李景和同志问我需要了解些什么问题的时候，我首先请他谈谈全县实现完全社会主义的农业合作化以后，县委的领导工作是不是已经由“被群众拖着跑”而转变为“赶到群众的前头”了呢？
    我所以提出这个问题，是因为李景和同志今年一月下旬在黑龙江省农村工作会议上的发言中，曾经对县委领导一再落后于群众这件事做过思想检查。县委在领导初级合作化运动阶段曾经犯过“小脚女人走路”的毛病，后来学习了毛泽东同志的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，思想提高了一步，这才提出了到1958年秋天全县实现高级合作化的计划。可是县委没有预料到前后不过两个月的时间，高级合作化运动竟迅速遍及全县。因此李景和同志代表县委在会议上作了检查，同时他也预见到了：紧接着完全社会主义合作化的高潮，必然会出现生产高潮。因此，他提出1956年全县粮食产量要比1955年计划产量提高20％。主要的增产措施是全县打井六千眼，土地施肥面积达到80％。
    应该说，李景和同志当时提出这样一个增产指标，勇气是不小的。因为双城县的农民从来没有打井浇地的习惯，同时，因为土地较多，过去农民种地也很少上粪。
    可是当李景和同志回答我提出的问题的时候，他一开口就感慨地说：“我们又落在群众后头了！不过，这回我们找到了门径，我们能够赶上去。”
    接着他就和我详细地谈起全县农民在增产运动中表现出来的社会主义积极性，和他自己的体会。
    全县原计划今年春季打井一千三百眼。这是一件大事，一开始，县委和各区委就都派出大批干部下乡领导这一工作。李景和也下乡去了。他发现县委工作组和各区委在发动群众制定打井计划的时候，有两种不同的观点和做法。在进化区，许多干部怀着一种畏难的心情下了乡，他们没有勇气把打井任务提到群众面前，他们只找了几个井匠“研究”。井匠们说，打井这件事可不简单，全区只有七个会打井的人，打一眼井得二十天，全区十五个村，每村打五眼井就得一百天。同时打井工的工资比较高，准备材料又有许多困难。算来算去，到六月底，全区只能打六十五眼井，远远达不到县委的要求。工作组也就没了办法，觉得只能这样办。直到后来学习了韩店区的经验，他们才去发动群众。
    韩店区的干部下乡以后却是另一种态度。他们找群众商量的时候，群众也提出了一大堆问题，除了技术和材料方面的困难以外，群众还怀疑打井到底顶用不顶用，一眼井能浇多少地，用什么办法去浇等等。干部们没有被群众提出的困难和疑虑所迷惑，他们仔细观察和探讨着一个问题，这就是群众提出来这许多顾虑，是表示他们对打井想不通呢，还是表示他们迫切要求打井呢？他们分析了各种情况：双城县缺水，经常因为天旱而影响播种。大豆开花的时候也常常因为缺雨而影响结荚。因此几年来增产总是不多，广大农民一直在为这件事情发愁。全县实现高级合作化以后，农民群众更强烈地要求改变这种情况，争取大量增产。打井，这是解决增产问题的根本措施之一，因此也就应该是广大农民的根本要求。同时他们也注意到，农民群众一面对打井有顾虑，另一面却兴致勃勃地在做试验，没有材料，他们到各家各户搜集；没有井匠，他们就自己学着干。一旦井底冒出了水，他们高兴得又是唱又是喊。干部由此断定，只要有领导，农民群众是愿意打井的。他们便一面培养典型，训练技术人材，一面核算打井的成本和效益，向农民群众进行宣传动员。经过了一系列的工作之后，一个轰轰烈烈的打井运动就在全区范围内开展起来。全区打井指标一再被群众突破——由112眼到213眼。原来大家发愁的技术问题、材料问题，都由群众解决了。不懂技术学习技术，没有材料就把自家的木材拿出来。
    县委大力组织各区学习韩店区的经验。到五月上旬，全县打井2，628眼，超过春季计划一倍多。
    全县的积肥运动也是这样。开始不少干部不懂得农民群众的要求。实现高级合作化以后，农民群众更加迫切地要求多劳动、多增产。可是社里的生产内容太少，大批劳动力找不到出路。农民群众的这种要求正是解决积肥问题的最好的条件。而干部呢？他们却把希望寄托在国家贷款上。贷款问题解决不了，他们就减少积肥数量，削减生产内容。至于增产计划能不能实现，靠什么实现，他们心里是没有底的。后来，周家区周启、周源等村群众自动地提出了“垧垧都上粪，没粪不下种”的口号，并且找到了很多粪源。这件事情引起了县委会的注意，随即派出工作组进行调查实验，就找到了二十多种粪源。这样，群众都干起来了。全县又很快地掀起了一个史无前例的“满粪运动”。结果全县90％以上的农业合作社在春播当中做到了每垧地上粪十万斤。
    这些动人的事实，使双城县委会的领导干部和一般工作人员受到了极其深刻的教育。李景和感慨地说：“实现高级合作化以后，广大群众的增产潜力究竟有多大，这实在难以估量。看起来，克服右倾保守思想并不是那么简单的事。不过，问题还在于我们用什么态度对待它。是安于这种一再落后于群众的状态呢，还是想办法跟上去？过去我们也知道，生产关系改变了，生产力解放了，可是那是从文件上学来的，那只是个概念。至于群众的社会主义积极性究竟表现在什么地方，怎样充分依靠和发挥他们这种积极性，只有真正接触了实际，只有深入到群众中去，才能把这问题在脑子里具体化起来，才能使自己领导群众前进的时候，有信心，有魄力。”
    李景和同志这个可贵的体验，使我脑子里的一个没有解决的问题得到了解答。在这一段时间里，我所接触到的农村工作同志，他们不少是充满朝气，站在群众前面领导群众前进；可是也有一些人，他们经常对群众的劳动积极性满口称赞，一提起来就有无限感慨；可是当他们订出的每一项计划一再被群众所突破的时候，他们却不去探求原因，也不去想想在自己手下埋没着多么大的生产潜力，而只轻松地说一句：“嘿，又落后了”，就算完事。似乎这是在新形势下不可免的事情，因此也就心安理得。在双城县我曾经和一个工作组的同志们谈起过这个问题，他们也一致认为这种安于“又落后了”的人，的确不是个别的。可是究竟怎样才能不落在群众的后头呢？当时还没有得出一个明确的答案。现在从李景和同志的体验来看，这并没有什么奥妙，问题还是要到群众中去解决。正如李景和自己所体验到的：只要你真正深入到群众中去，听听他们究竟要求什么，看看他们的积极性究竟表现在什么地方，你心中就有底了，你就能找到领导他们前进的办法，你也就有了领导魄力。
