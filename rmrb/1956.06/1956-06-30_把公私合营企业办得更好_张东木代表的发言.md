    To Run Joint State-Private Enterprises Better
    —Speech by Representative Zhang Dongmu
    I fully agree with all the reports presented at this conference and suggest that the conference approve them separately.
    Originally, I brought some questions about joint state-private enterprises before the meeting, intending to raise them at the conference and ask the relevant departments to resolve them. However, after listening to Vice Premier Chen Yun's report at the conference, these problems were all solved, and solved very thoroughly. Vice Premier Chen's report is completely in line with the actual situation, and the proposed methods are practical and feasible. In particular, the provisions for fixed interest are a great consideration for industrialists and businessmen. After reading this report, the industrial and commercial circles in Jinan City generally expressed excitement and felt warm. Some said, "This report solves problems so well, it's really thoughtful for small business owners, guaranteeing their livelihood"; some said, "The fixed interest is so high, it's truly generous and considerate"; some said, "In the past, we felt the government was merging factories and stores too slowly, but after reading the report, we completely clarified the mistaken idea of large-scale mergers"; others said, "In the past, we said the future was bright, but it always felt vague, but after reading the report, the bright future became concrete." Vice Premier Chen's report specifically embodies the correctness and greatness of the Party and the state's policy of peacefully transforming private industry and commerce, which will more powerfully promote the advancement of the socialist transformation cause. This report is an encouragement to industrialists and businessmen, and also a spur to industrialists and businessmen. We guarantee that we will run joint state-private enterprises better in accordance with Vice Premier Chen's instructions.
    Vice Premier Chen, in his report, put forward solutions to some of the main problems existing in the current joint ventures, which provided a basis for our Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association to assist the government in running joint venture enterprises well. In order to correctly implement Vice Premier Chen's instructions, we still need to do a lot of work under the leadership of the Party and government, and we also need strong cooperation from all parties. In particular, the issue of the working relationship between the public and private sectors in joint ventures still requires a lot of in-depth and meticulous work. I would like to express some opinions on this issue, and I ask all representatives to criticize and correct me.
    At present, in some joint ventures, the working relationship between the public and private sectors is not normal enough, and both the public and private sectors are responsible for this, but many of the problems are caused by the unhealthy ideological factors of private sector personnel. Therefore, in order to improve the working relationship in joint ventures, we must first start by solving the ideological problems of private sector personnel. It should be said that after the upsurge of socialist transformation, the ideological consciousness of the vast number of industrialists and businessmen has improved to varying degrees, and most people are willing to work hard under the leadership of the public sector and the supervision of the staff and workers, play their due role, and contribute more to socialism. However, there are still a few people who, after the enterprise is jointly operated, show a negative attitude. They believe that "wages and fixed interest are fixed, anyway, we get this money, it doesn't matter if we do less work or more," and they hold the attitude of doing the job for the sake of doing the job. This attitude is extremely wrong. We should actively persuade and educate these people, explain to them that everyone has a share in socialism, and everyone should be responsible, improve their ideological understanding, so that they can change and move forward to socialism with everyone. There are also some people who subjectively want to do a good job, but they think that their education is low and their ability is poor, and they lack confidence in doing a good job. They show inferiority everywhere, and they are afraid of hardship in learning, and their desire to improve is not strong. This attitude is also wrong. It is glorious to work hard for socialism, and this will not be distinguished by the level of education or the strength of ability. As long as we adopt a realistic attitude and wholeheartedly contribute all our strength, we will be welcomed under any conditions. Of course, we should also be determined to learn actively, not be afraid of hardship, and strive to improve our abilities, so that we can work more and better for socialism. In addition, there are some people who, although they have strong working abilities, dare not boldly and proactively carry out their work due to some unnecessary ideological concerns. They believe that although the enterprise has been jointly operated, they are still members of the bourgeoisie. They are afraid of making mistakes and being attacked in their work. They are hesitant and timid, and they regard accepting the leadership of the public sector as "Confucius entering the Grand Temple" and ask about everything. This is not the attitude that should be taken. Adopting this attitude will inevitably fail to play one's due role and affect the production and operation of the enterprise, which is detrimental to both the country and the individual. We should help these people understand the important significance of working for socialism and the responsibilities that private sector personnel should fulfill, so that they can put down their ideological burdens and happily and proactively run the enterprise's production and operation well. Finally, there are still a few people who, after the enterprise is jointly operated, still maintain their past arrogant style, holding on to their past "airs," refusing to face up to their shortcomings and mistakes, refusing to humbly listen to the opinions of the staff and workers, and learn from the staff and workers, refusing to conduct self-criticism and correct their shortcomings and mistakes, and even sitting there waiting for the public sector representatives to unite with him. Some people do not speak face-to-face about certain issues, but talk nonsense behind their backs. These situations seriously affect the unity within the enterprise. We should actively criticize this incorrect attitude, explain the harm of this attitude to enterprise transformation and personal transformation, and correct this wrong attitude through ideological education.
    The above-mentioned situations are only some of the main problems that I have discovered in my work in Jinan City. In addition, there are other ideological problems among private sector personnel. Our Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association should adopt a positive attitude and vigorously assist the government in doing a good job in the ideological education of private sector personnel. Getting through the ideological problems of private sector personnel is the primary task of improving the working relationship of joint ventures.
    In addition, in order to improve the working relationship of joint ventures, the work of public sector representatives also needs to be improved accordingly. Public sector representatives bear the responsibility of leadership in joint ventures. They have made remarkable achievements in improving the production and operation of enterprises, uniting and educating private sector personnel, and correctly implementing the Party and the state's policies and laws. However, there are still some shortcomings in the work of a few people. Some have an insufficient understanding of the policy of peaceful transformation, and they are still unable to turn around in their specific work. They have done less work in uniting and educating private sector personnel, and they are accustomed to doing things on their own in their work methods. They adopt an attitude of distrust towards private sector personnel, and even do not want to approach private sector personnel. For example, some private sector personnel in Jinan City reported: "The public sector representative said that my drawer is not locked, which is negligence, but my drawer has no confidential documents or ordinary documents, what should I be vigilant about in an empty drawer?" Some also reported: "I am in charge of making phone calls to convene meetings, but I am not clear about the content of the meetings." Some merge enterprises without consulting with private sector personnel, and only tell private sector personnel when they start to act; some enterprise employees have been transferred away for many days, and private sector personnel do not know. Although these phenomena are not universally present, they also illustrate the shortcomings of public sector representatives in their thinking and working methods, which also have a certain impact on the work enthusiasm of private sector personnel. Therefore, the shortcomings of both public and private sector personnel should be seriously corrected. I believe that both the public and private sectors should be open and honest in the enterprise. Private sector personnel should actively strive for the leadership of public sector representatives, and public sector representatives should also respect the correct opinions of private sector personnel and work together to improve the working relationship. I suggest that the relevant professional bureaus and professional companies should promptly summarize the good and bad examples of cooperation between the public and private sectors in the future, hold regular meetings, disseminate good experiences, commend good people and good deeds, and criticize mistakes. This is of great educational significance to both the public and private sectors. Improving the relationship of unity and cooperation in joint ventures is an important guarantee for enterprise transformation and personal transformation. I believe that under the leadership of the Party, we will definitely be able to do this work well.

    把公私合营企业办得更好
    ——张东木代表的发言
    我完全同意这次大会所提出的各项报告，并建议大会分别予以批准通过。
    本来我在开会以前曾经带来了关于公私合营企业的一些问题，准备在大会上提出请各有关部门解决。但是在大会上听了陈云副总理的报告以后，这些问题都解决了，而且解决的很彻底。陈副总理的报告是完全符合实际情况的，所提出的办法是切实可行的，特别对于定息的规定更是对工商业者的极大照顾。济南市工商界在看了这个报告以后，普遍表示兴奋，感到温暖。有的说：“这个报告太解决问题了，对小业主真周到，生活有了保证”；有的说：“定息这样高，真是宽大了再宽大，照顾了又照顾”；有的说：“过去嫌政府合厂并店进行的慢，看了报告之后才彻底澄清了大合并的错误想法”；也有的说：“过去说前途光明总觉得模糊，看了报告以后前途光明就具体了”。陈副总理的报告具体地体现了党和国家和平改造私营工商业的政策的正确和伟大，它将更有力地推动社会主义改造事业的前进。这个报告是对工商业者的鼓励，也是对工商业者的鞭策，我们保证一定要按照陈副总理的指示把公私合营企业办得更好。
    陈副总理在报告中把当前合营企业存在的一些主要问题都提出了解决意见，这就使我们工商联、民建会对于协助政府搞好合营企业的工作有了依据。为了正确地贯彻陈副总理的指示，我们还需要在党政的领导下做很多工作，还需要各方面的有力配合。特别是对合营企业中公方和私方的工作关系问题，还需要做很多深入细致的工作。我想就这个问题发表一些意见，请各位代表批评指正。
    目前，在有些合营企业中公方和私方在工作关系上是不够正常的，这在公方和私方都有责任，但是其中有不少问题是由于私方人员思想上的不健康因素而引起的。因此，为了要搞好合营企业中的工作关系，首先必须从解决私方人员的思想问题入手。应该说，经过社会主义改造高潮以后，广大的工商业者的思想觉悟都有了不同程度的提高，多数的人都愿意在公方的领导和职工的监督下努力把工作做好，发挥自己应有的作用，为社会主义贡献更多的力量。但是也还有少数的人在企业合营以后，表现消极态度，他们认为“工资、定息都是一定的了，反正是拿这些钱，工作少做多做没有关系”，抱着做一天和尚撞一天钟的态度。这种态度是极端错误的。我们应该积极地向这些人进行说服教育，向他们说明社会主义人人有份，人人都应该负责，提高他们的思想认识，使他们转变过来，和大家一道向社会主义前进。也有些人主观上是想努力搞好工作的，但是自己认为文化低、能力差，对搞好工作缺乏信心，处处表现自卑，而在学习上又怕艰苦，上进心不强。这种态度也是不对的。为社会主义努力工作都是光荣的，这不会因为文化高低、能力强弱而有所区别，只要我们采取实事求是的态度，全心全意地贡献出自己的全部力量，在任何条件下都是会受到欢迎的。当然还应该下定决心积极地学习，不畏艰苦，努力提高自己的能力，以便为社会主义工作得更多更好。另外还有些人虽然有较强的工作能力，但是却因为思想上的一些不必要顾虑，不敢大胆地主动地去进行工作，他们认为企业虽然已经合营了，但个人仍旧是资产阶级分子，在工作中怕犯错误，怕受打击，表现为缩手缩脚，畏首畏尾，把接受公方领导看成“孔子进太庙”事事问，这也不是应有的态度，采取这种态度就必然不能发挥自己应起的作用，影响企业的生产经营，这对国家对个人都是不利的。我们应该帮助这些人认识为社会主义工作的重要意义，和私方人员应尽的职责，使他们放下思想包袱，愉快地主动地搞好企业的生产经营。最后，还有少数人在企业合营以后，仍然保持着过去的自高自大的作风，端着过去的“架子”，不肯正视自己的缺点和错误，不肯虚心地倾听职工群众的意见，并向职工群众学习，不肯进行自我批评改正缺点和错误，甚至坐在那里等待着公方代表去团结他。还有的对某些问题当面不讲，背后乱讲。这些情况都严重地影响搞好企业内部的团结，我们应该积极地去批判这种不正确的态度，说明这种态度对企业改造和个人改造的危害性，通过思想教育纠正这种错误的态度。
    上面所说的一些情况，仅是我在济南市的工作中所发现的一些主要的问题，另外在私方人员中也还存在着其它的一些思想问题，我们工商联、民建会应该采取积极的态度，大力协助政府做好对私方人员的思想教育工作。搞通私方人员的思想问题，这是搞好合营企业工作关系的首要工作。
    此外，为了搞好合营企业的工作关系，公方代表的工作也需要有相应的改进。公方代表在合营企业中担负着领导的责任，他们在搞好企业的生产经营，团结教育私方人员，正确地贯彻党和国家的政策法令等各方面，取得显著的成绩，但是也有少数人在工作上还存在着一些缺点。有的对和平改造的政策领会不够，在具体工作中还有些转不过弯来，对私方人员的团结教育工作做得较少，工作方法上习惯于包办，对私方人员采取不信任的态度，甚至不愿接近私方人员。例如济南市有的私方人员反映：“公方代表说我抽屉不上锁是麻痹大意，但我的抽屉既无机密文件，又无普通文件，空空如也的抽屉让我警惕什么呢”？还有的反映：“我专管打电话召集开会，但会议内容我却不清楚”。有的进行企业合并不与私方人员协商，仅在开始行动的时候才告诉私方人员；有的企业的职工已经调走好多天，私方人员还不知道。这些现象虽然不是普遍存在的，但也说明了公方代表的思想上和工作方法上的缺点，对私方人员的工作积极性也有一定的影响，所以无论公方或私方人员的缺点，都应该认真的纠正。我认为：在企业中公私双方都应该开诚相见，私方人员要主动地争取公方代表的领导，公方代表也要尊重私方人员的正确的意见，共同努力搞好工作关系。我建议有关专业局、专业公司今后要及时总结公私双方共事的好坏典型，定期召开会议，传播好的经验，表扬好人好事，批评错误。这对公私双方都有很大的教育意义，搞好合营企业的团结共事关系是企业改造和人的改造的重要保证。我相信，在党的领导下，我们一定可以把这项工作做好。
