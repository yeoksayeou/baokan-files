Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th: According to TASS, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote a letter to Turkish Prime Minister Menderes on June 6th, hoping that the Turkish government would carefully consider the Soviet government's statement on disarmament issued on May 14th, attached to the letter. He also hoped that the Turkish government would find it possible to follow the Soviet Union's example and take steps to reduce its armed forces.

In the letter, Bulganin said: The large expenditures on arms expansion by many countries have brought serious economic difficulties to their own countries and created a heavy burden for their people. Turkish government officials have repeatedly mentioned this in their conversations. Therefore, it is even more necessary to take concrete measures to reduce armaments and armed forces.

Bulganin said: We are convinced that if countries take measures to reduce their own armed forces before reaching an agreement on disarmament, it will establish a high degree of trust between countries and strengthen universal peace. This is especially important in the relations between neighboring countries.

Bulganin's letter was written on the same day as the letters to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Canada, and West Germany. The letter was delivered to the Turkish Republic's Foreign Minister, Köprülü, on June 8th by the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Podtserob.

    布尔加宁写信给曼德列斯
    希望土耳其采取裁减军备的步骤
    新华社12日讯　　据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在六月六日写信给土耳其总理曼德列斯，希望土耳其政府仔细考虑附在这封信中的苏联政府五月十四日就裁军问题所发表的声明，并且希望土耳其政府认为效法苏联的榜样采取裁减武装部队的步骤是可能的。
    布尔加宁在信中说：许多国家在扩充军备上用的大笔开支给自己的国家带来了严重的经济困难，给国民造成了沉重的负担，土耳其政府人士在他们的谈话中也曾经屡次地提到这一点，因此，采取具体的裁减军备和武装部队的措施就更为必要。
    布尔加宁说：我们深信，如果各国在就裁军问题达成协议之前就实行裁减自己武装部队的措施，那么在国家之间将会建立起高度的信任，将会加强普遍的和平，这一点在邻国之间的关系上尤其重要。
    布尔加宁的这封信是在给美、英、法、意、加和西德政府首脑的信的同一天写的。这封信已经由苏联驻土耳其大使波德采罗布在六月八日交给了土耳其共和国外交部长柯普路鲁。
