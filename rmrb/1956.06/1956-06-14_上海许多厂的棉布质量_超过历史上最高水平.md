Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 13th. In May and the first ten days of June, the cotton cloth quality of sixteen state-owned cotton textile factories with weaving workshops in Shanghai exceeded the highest level in history. In May, an average of 96.89 out of every 100 bolts of cloth produced by each factory were of the highest grade. All factories completed their quality plans. In the first ten days of June, eleven factories produced more than 99% first-class cotton cloth; the lowest also reached 89.8%.

According to the person in charge of the Technology Division of the East China Textile Administration Bureau: The main reason for the improvement in the quality of cotton cloth is the improved quality of cotton yarn. According to national standards, in December of last year, only 52% of the cotton yarn in each factory reached the first-class standard; in the first ten days of June this year, first-class cotton yarn has reached more than 87%.

From January to the present, the unit output of cotton cloth in each factory has also increased month by month. If converted to Renminshi cloth, the average output per cloth machine per hour in each factory in May was half a chi more than in January, and a total of more than 3,010,000 meters of cotton cloth was produced more than planned from January to May.

    上海许多厂的棉布质量
    超过历史上最高水平
    新华社上海13日电　五月份和六月上旬，上海十六个有织布工场的国营棉纺织厂，棉布质量超过了历史上最高的水平。五月份，各厂平均每一百匹布有九十六点八九匹是上等品。所有的厂都完成了质量计划。六月份的头十天，有十一个厂生产的正品棉布，达到99％以上；最低的也达到89.8％。
    据华东纺织管理局技术处负责人谈：棉布质量提高的主要原因，是由于棉纱的质量改善了。按照国家规定的标准，去年十二月各厂只有52％的棉纱达到一等一级标准；今年六月上旬，一等一级的棉纱已经达到87％以上。
    一月到现在，各厂棉布的单位产量也逐月上升。如果折合人民市布计算，五月份各厂每台布机一小时的产量，平均比一月份多生产半市尺，一到五月份共比计划多生产了三百零一万多公尺棉布。
