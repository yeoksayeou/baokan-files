"Unlucky Genius"

Dulles has repeatedly boasted about his ingenious invention – "travel diplomacy."

In January of this year, he calculated that in his three years in office, he had "traveled" a total of 226,645 miles around the world to deal with "major issues." Recently, in just over four months, his "travel" record has increased to 310,000 miles.

Dulles calls his "travel" diplomacy a "change" to the "basic concept of the position of Secretary of State." He says he finds that in the stable atmosphere of a long flight he can "work more effectively" than he can in his office at the State Department.

Outsiders, of course, can't fathom Dulles' understanding of the "basic concept of the position of Secretary of State"; however, judging from the foreign policy pursued by the U.S. Secretary of State, it is not difficult for people to judge based on the facts whether Dulles' rushing around all over the world is more effective than his predecessors who spent more time in the State Department.

Dulles argues, "It is foolish to rely solely on the old-fashioned method of exchanging notes." And his method of flying around to various places to talk face-to-face with government officials is much more effective.

Here, Dulles admits that the old American method of sitting in Washington and issuing orders is no longer effective, and the Secretary of State needs to personally go to the scene to work. But, does this "new" method have any better effect in supporting the bankrupt "policy of strength"?

The famous American columnist Lippmann recently politely asked, "Mr. Dulles has traveled 310,000 miles, can it be said that he has spread good understanding throughout the globe?" Lippmann politely did not offer a direct answer.

The answer is actually not difficult to find.

Just take Dulles' own most complacent bragging about the several trips that brought the United States to the "brink of war" as examples:

Once was in April 1954, when he rushed to London and then to Paris to plan to expand the intervention in the Indochina War, and to get his partners to agree to the United States using atomic weapons to "destroy the Chinese Communist base in South China."

Another time was in late 1954 and early 1955, when Dulles visited Southeast Asia, making a great show of intimidation and threats, saying that the United States' war plan in the Taiwan Strait "is serious."

These two "trips" did not even cause understanding among America's "allies" and Dulles' "compatriots." Attacks, scolding, and ridicule of Dulles' "brink of war" clamor, like huge waves, surged out from every corner of the world, and from all levels of American society, unanimously surrounding and attacking him, forcing this boaster to change his tune.

Moreover, this year, Dulles' self-bragging new tens of thousands of miles of "travel" – whether attending the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting held in March this year or attending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council held in May, were the most fruitless and most unpopular.

Dulles recently admitted, "The world is at a moment when a series of rapidly occurring important events are changing the face of Europe, the Near East, and Asia," and this new situation makes the United States' diplomatic work "more difficult."

What kind of situation makes Dulles feel "difficult"? It is the situation where Dulles' "travel" wants to incite fear, but – in Dulles' words – "the sentiment of fear no longer exists"; Dulles' "travel" continues to put pressure on his allies, but – again in Dulles' words – "allies no longer feel... they must eliminate differences"; Dulles' "travel" insists on forcing peaceful and neutral Asian and Middle Eastern countries to submit under his "protective umbrella," but – still in Dulles' own words – "neutralism is considered a safe and advantageous approach."

For Dulles, who peddles the so-called "liberation" policy, the most unable to make him feel at ease is probably his conclusion: "We cannot restore the world to what it was." And it is precisely this point that determines the unlucky fate of Dulles' diplomacy – no matter how many travel records he has.

Therefore, if it can be said that Dulles surpasses his predecessors with his ingenious inventions, then it is undoubtedly more appropriate to use the words of the British "Observer": Dulles has an "unlucky genius"!

### “倒霉的天才”

   “倒霉的天才”
    杜勒斯屡屡夸耀他的天才的发明——“旅行外交”。
    今年一月，他计算了一下，在他任职的三年中，一共曾在世界各地“旅行”了二十二万六千六百四十五英里来处理“重大的问题”。最近，不过相隔四个多月，他的“旅行”纪录已增加到三十一万英里了。
    杜勒斯把他的“旅行”外交，称为“改变”了“对国务卿这个职务的基本概念”。他说，他发见他在一次长途的飞行的安定的气氛中能够比他呆在国务院的办公室里“工作得更加有效”。
    杜勒斯怎样理解“国务卿这个职务的基本概念”，局外人当然莫测高深；不过从美国国务卿所执行的外交政策来说，杜勒斯风尘仆仆满天飞，比起他的更多地呆在国务院办公室里的前任来，是否较有成效，人们是不难根据事实作出判断的。
    杜勒斯争辩说：“一味用老式的交换照会的方法是愚蠢的。”而他的飞到各处地方同各国政府官员面对面地交谈的办法要有效得多。
    在这里，杜勒斯承认了过去美国那种惯常坐在华盛顿发号施令的方法已经大大不灵了，需要国务卿劳驾亲自到各个现场去进行工作。但是，这个“新”的方法，在支撑破产了的“实力政策”方面，效果是否稍微好一点呢？
    美国有名的专栏作家李普曼最近委婉地问道：“杜勒斯先生旅行过三十一万英里了，能说在全地球散布了良好的谅解了吗？”李普曼客气地没有提出正面的答案。
    答案其实是并不难找到的。
    只要举杜勒斯自己曾经最洋洋自得地吹嘘过的曾经把美国带到“战争边缘”的几次旅行作为例子：
    一次是在1954年4月，他匆匆忙忙地飞到伦敦，又飞到巴黎，去策划扩大干涉印度支那战争，并要他的伙伴们同意美国使用原子武器来“炸毁中国共产党在华南的基地”。
    另一次是在1954年年底和1955年初，杜勒斯访问东南亚，大肆恫吓和威胁说：美国在台湾海峡的战争打算“是认真的”。
    这两次“旅行”甚至在美国的“同盟国”和杜勒斯的“同胞”中间也没有引起谅解。对杜勒斯的“战争边缘”叫嚣的抨击、怒骂和嘲笑，像巨大的浪潮一般，从世界每一个角落里，也从美国各阶层里涌出来，一致向他围攻，迫使这位夸口者不得不改变调子。
    再说，今年以来，杜勒斯自吹自擂的新的几万英里的“旅行”——无论是参加今年三月举行的东南亚条约组织理事会会议或是出席五月举行的北大西洋公约理事会，都是最没有成果和最不受欢迎的。
    杜勒斯最近承认：“世界正处在一个接连不断迅速发生的重要事件改变着欧洲、近东和亚洲的面貌的时刻”，这种新局势使美国的外交工作“更加困难”。
    究竟是怎样一种局势使得杜勒斯感觉起“困难”来了呢？是这样的局势：杜勒斯的“旅行”要煽动恐惧，但——用杜勒斯的话——“恐惧情绪已经不再存在”；杜勒斯的“旅行”继续对他的盟国施加压力，但——再用杜勒斯的话——“盟国不再感到……必须消除分歧了”；杜勒斯的“旅行”硬要和平中立的亚洲、中近东国家屈服在他的“保护伞”下，但——还是用杜勒斯自己的话——“中立主义被认为是一个安全的、有利的方针”。
    对于贩卖所谓“解放”政策的杜勒斯来说，最不能够使他泰然自若的大概要算他的这样一个结论了：“我们不能使世界上已经发生的事情恢复原状”。而恰恰是这一点决定了杜勒斯外交——不论旅行纪录多少——的倒霉的命运。
    因此，如果可以说杜勒斯以他的天才发明胜过他的前任，那末用英国“观察家报”的话来说无疑更为恰当：杜勒斯有的是“倒霉的天才”！
