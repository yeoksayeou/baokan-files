Along the coastal overseas Chinese hometowns of Fujian Province, the spring harvest of coarse grains is generally abundant. In the Jinjiang and Longxi Special Districts and the suburbs of Xiamen, the average yield of barley, broad beans, peas, potatoes, etc., has increased by more than double compared to last year. At present, the harvest of coarse grains in southern Fujian is complete, and many returned overseas Chinese and their families have written letters telling their relatives and friends abroad about the good news of the bumper harvest.
