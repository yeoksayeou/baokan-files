    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report.

    In the 1956 budget, we see that the state will use more funds to develop social, cultural, and educational undertakings. Among them, expenditures on culture, education, science, and health are 3,506,176,000 yuan, an increase of 25.34% compared to 1955. This is very exciting for those of us engaged in cultural and educational undertakings. However, the budget report also puts forward the tasks of cultural and educational undertakings. In higher education, the number of college students in 1956 will increase by more than 90,000 compared to 1955. Of course, the increase in this task is large, and it will be difficult to complete this task, but it is based on the needs of the country's socialist construction. In recent years, the rapid development of China's industry and agriculture has made the requirements for the quantity and quality of senior technical cadres increasingly urgent. Therefore, accepting and completing this task is a glorious task for our comrades in higher education. However, how to complete it, based on my personal experience, I would like to offer a few suggestions.

    1.  The main task of higher education institutions should be to train cadres and to conduct teaching work. However, in order to improve the faculty level, improve teaching quality, and solve some national scientific research tasks, teachers in higher education institutions must carry out scientific research work. In the past few years, not enough attention has been paid to carrying out scientific research work in universities in a led and planned way, so the potential of teachers has not been fully realized. But since the Party called for marching towards science, the majority of teachers have actively formulated scientific research work plans, which is good. However, at present, some teachers are no longer interested in how to meet the workload of teachers and improve the quality of teaching. Some even have the idea that the less teaching work they undertake, the better, or they are perfunctory. Some teachers also feel that their teaching tasks are a burden, and some even want to leave teaching work and transfer to the Academy of Sciences to do research work. These phenomena should be brought to the attention of Party and government leaders in a timely manner and corrected. In order to complete the teaching work of the increased 90,000 students, we need the teachers who are currently engaged in teaching to continue their enthusiasm and efforts in teaching work over the past few years, without any slackening. The relationship between teaching work and scientific research work in schools should be properly arranged. They should be closely integrated and should not be opposed to each other. The contradiction of time should be resolved through careful planning, rational allocation of manpower, and meticulous calculation. It was wrong to emphasize teaching work in the past and neglect the scientific research work of teachers, but if in the future we pay attention to scientific research work in higher education institutions and relax teaching work, it will be even more wrong, and the most important task of higher education institutions will not be completed.

    2.  The faculty issue: It is the most important factor in completing our tasks, but it is also the most difficult problem to solve at present. In the years since liberation, the number of students in higher education institutions has increased rapidly, but the number of graduates retained as faculty members has not been able to meet the requirements every year. The number of students increased in 1956 is much larger than in any previous year, so the contradiction is particularly obvious. For example, in medical education, according to the increase in student tasks this year and next year, and according to the calculation of teacher workload, the two medical colleges in Shanghai need to increase at least about 500 graduates this summer (because in the later courses of medical colleges, in addition to increasing teachers, clinical doctors also need to be increased), but it is actually heard that only about 100 will be assigned as faculty members. This is really a difficulty in completing the quantitative task and ensuring a certain quality. To solve this problem, I think we should start from the following two aspects.

    First, the unified distribution of this year's graduates must take into account the urgency of the work to be assigned. There have been some shortcomings in this regard in the past. Some units do not need graduates of this major, so they are asked to change to other jobs. Some units do not necessarily need graduates of this major at present, but they are assigned early and have nothing to do, such as some medical college graduates assigned to factories and mines, which are still under construction and will have to wait a year or two before they have outpatient departments and hospitals. The workload of some units is not enough, so the graduates assigned there are idle. Such phenomena of waste and backlog of manpower should be strictly avoided. This part of the manpower should be enriched to higher education institutions that urgently need faculty members. In higher education institutions, graduates can continue to receive professional training, and when other units really need them, they can be transferred again, which can also improve work efficiency. Therefore, it is hoped that relevant departments will give higher education institutions more faculty members when distributing graduates this summer. This can ensure the completion of the current quantitative task and the quality of future graduates.

    Second, teaching assistants should be increased. In the teaching work of higher education institutions, there are many tasks that only require a technician, clerk, or secretary with a certain amount of training to handle. However, at present, the staffing of teaching assistants is very tight, so some teachers have to personally engage in contact, discussion, copying, and laboratory management. Some old teachers with high skills are also unable to carry out scientific research work because they cannot get enough assistants. If we can increase such auxiliary personnel, teachers will have more time to engage in teaching work and scientific research work, which is equivalent to increasing the strength of the faculty. This is a feasible and good way to solve the current shortage of faculty members. It is also a concrete measure that must be taken to implement the Party's policy on intellectuals. We hope that the relevant leading departments can solve this problem as soon as possible.

    3.  The issue of learning from the Soviet Union and learning from the scientific achievements of all countries. I agree with and support the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." In the past few years, we have emphasized learning from the Soviet Union, and it is a shortcoming that we have not learned from the scientific achievements of other countries. In learning from the Soviet Union, some mechanical copying is also wrong. However, in recent years, thanks to the teachers learning many advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and thanks to the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, there have been achievements in the teaching reform of higher education institutions, and the achievements are the main ones. Therefore, when we correct shortcomings, we must clarify this point. In the future, we should continue to learn from the Soviet Union, combine with China's specific conditions, and analyze specific problems to determine what to learn and how to implement it, so as to further improve teaching quality and reduce the burden on students. This should still be a major aspect of our work. At the same time, we must pay special attention to learning from all other countries, and learn from their advanced experiences in science and technology. But regardless of whether we learn from the Soviet Union or other countries, in learning, we should pay more attention to combining with China's specific conditions and developing our own independent creative spirit. At present, some people think that criticizing the worship of the United States is unnecessary, and that in the future, we can learn from countries such as Britain, the United States, and France without criticism, just like before liberation. Some people doubt the previous set of learning from the Soviet Union, thinking that it can all be changed, and even the old set can be restored. Some people even think that we can do without learning from the Soviet Union in the future. All of these are incorrect, incomplete, and will be harmful to the work. I think we should correct the shortcomings in the methods of learning from the Soviet Union on the existing basis and continue to work hard to learn advanced experiences from the Soviet Union. This will prevent us from becoming confused in our thinking, avoid detours in our work, and more quickly reduce the chaotic phenomenon in teaching work, so as to improve work efficiency as soon as possible and meet and complete this glorious and arduous task.

    提高高等学校的师资水平和教学质量
    ——章央分代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”，和彭真副委员长的工作报告。
    在1956年的预算中，我们看到国家将用更多的资金，来发展社会文教事业。其中文化、教育、科学、卫生事业支出为3，506，176，000元，比1955年增长了25.34％。这是使我们从事于文教事业的人，感到非常兴奋的。但在预算报告中，也提出了文教事业的任务。其中高等教育方面，1956年的在校大学生就将比1955年增加9万余人。当然，这个任务的增加数字是大的，完成这个任务是会有一定困难的，但它是根据国家社会主义建设的需要。几年来，我国工农业的突飞猛进的发展，对高级技术干部的数量和质量的要求，越来越迫切。因此，接受和完成这个任务，是我们高等教育工作的同志们的一个光荣任务。但如何来完成，仅就我个人体会，提出几点意见。
    一、高等学校的任务主要的应该是培养干部，是教学工作，但为了提高师资水平，提高教学质量和解决部分国家科学研究工作的任务，因此高等学校的教师必须进行科学研究工作。过去几年，在高等学校中，有领导有计划地开展科学研究工作是注意得很不够的，因此教师中的潜力未能得到发挥。但自从党号召向科学进军以来，广大教师都纷纷订立了科学研究工作计划，这是好的。但目前却也有部分教师，对于如何满足教师工作量，提高教学质量，开始不感兴趣，个别的还有越少担任教学工作越好的想法，或者应付了事。也有些教师对自己所负的教学任务开始感到是一种负担，个别的还想脱离教学工作，转到科学院去做研究工作。这种种现象应及时地引起党政领导的注意而加以纠正。为了完成增加了的9万余学生的教学工作，我们须要目下正在从事教学工作的教师们，继续过去几年来在教学工作上的热情和努力，而不能有任何松懈。学校中的教学工作和科学研究工作的关系应摆妥当，它们应该密切结合，而不应该互相对立。时间的矛盾，应该通过周密的计划，合理地分配人力和用精打细算的方法来解决。过去强调了教学工作，忽视了教师们的科学研究工作是错误，但若今后在高等学校中注意了科学研究工作，而放松了教学工作，那就更不对头了，就将无法完成高等学校最主要的任务。
    二、师资问题：它是我们完成任务中最重要的因素，但恰恰也是目下最难解决的问题。解放几年来，高等学校的学生数字增加很快，但留作师资的毕业生，却是每年不能满足要求。而1956年所增加的学生数字比过去任何一年要多得多，因此矛盾也就特别显明起来了。例如在医学教育中，上海两个医学院按照今年和明年学生任务的增加，按照教师工作量计算，至少需要在今暑增加五百名左右毕业生（因为在医学院的后期课中，除了需要增加教师外，还需要增加临床医生），而实际听说将要分配作为师资的不过百名左右。这在完成数量任务和保证一定质量上，实在是个困难。要解决这个问题，我认为应从以下两方面着手。
    第一、对今暑毕业生统一分配，必须考虑到所分配去担任工作的轻重缓急。过去在这方面是有些缺点的。有些单位并不需要这一科毕业生，因而叫改行作别的工作，有些单位目下还不一定要这样一科毕业生，而提早分配去了，闲着没事做，例如有些医学院毕业生分配到厂矿去，那些还才在基建，要等待一两年后才有门诊部和医院。有些单位的工作量不够，因此使分配去的毕业生闲得慌。这种种浪费和积压人力的现象，应该严格设法避免。应该把这部分人力，充实到目下迫切需要师资的高等学校去。在高等学校中，毕业生还可继续得到专业培养，等其他单位实属需要时，再调去，还可以提高工作效果。因此希望有关部门在今暑分配毕业生时，应该给高等学校多留师资。这样才能保证目下数量任务和将来毕业生的质量的完成。
    第二、要增设教学辅助人员。在高等学校的教学工作中，有许多工作是只需要一个有一定时间训练的技术员、文书或秘书能办的事，而目下对教学辅助人员的编制扣得很紧，因此有些教师不得不亲自从事于接洽、商讨、抄写以及实验室管理等等工作。还有些技术高的老教师，也因为得不到足够的助手而不能开展科学研究工作。若如我们能增设这类辅助人员，就能使教师们有更多的时间从事教学工作和科学研究工作，这就等于增加了师资的力量。这对解决目下师资缺少，是一个可行的好办法。也是贯彻党的知识分子政策必须做的具体措施。我们希望有关领导部门能从速解决这个问题。
    三、学习苏联和学习一切国家科学的成就的问题。我同意而且拥护“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。过去几年，我们强调了学习苏联，而对其他国家的科学成就不学习是有缺点的，在学习苏联上，有些生搬硬套也是不对的。但几年来，由于教师们向苏联学习了许多先进经验，由于苏联专家们的热情帮助，在高等学校教学改革上是有成绩的，而且成绩是主要的。因此，当我们在纠正缺点时，必须把这点弄清楚。今后我们应继续向苏联学习，结合中国具体情况，分析具体问题来决定学些什么，如何执行，进一步提高教学质量，减轻学生负担，这还应是我们工作中的主要一方面。同时，我们必须特别注意向一切其他国家学习，学习他们在科学和技术上的先进经验。但不管学习苏联也好，学习其他国家也好，在学习中，更应该注意结合我国具体情况，和发挥我们自己的独立创造精神。目下有些人认为批判崇美思想是不必要的，认为今后可以不加批判地，像解放以前一样地学习英、美、法等国家。有些人对以前学习苏联的一套发生怀疑，认为都可以改掉，甚至可以恢复旧的一套。有些人还认为今后可以不要学习苏联了。这等等都是不正确的，不全面的，都是对工作会有害处的。我认为我们应该在现有的基础上，纠正向苏联学习中方法上的缺点，继续努力向苏联学习先进经验。这样才能使我们不致于在思想上发生混乱，在工作中少走弯路，能更快地减少教学工作中的忙乱现象，从速地提高工作效果，来迎接和完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务。
