    Farmers in Jishou Massively Breed Ducks
    More than 200 Miao and Han agricultural production cooperatives in Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, plan to breed 200,000 ducks this year.
    Duck raising has always been a major sideline income for Miao and Han farmers in Jishou County. "Qianzhou Pressed Duck" – Jishou County was formerly named Qiancheng County, with the county seat located in Qianzhou – is renowned in the Xiangxi area for its delicious and fragrant meat. However, in the past, scattered farmers could not spare enough labor to raise ducks on a large scale. This year, 90% of the Miao and Han farmers in Jishou County have joined agricultural cooperatives, resulting in surplus labor, and many cooperatives have specifically organized duck hatching and raising groups. To support the development of duck breeding production, the county farm and supply and marketing cooperative have organized skilled duck hatchers, planning to hatch more than 150,000 ducks this year for supply to agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, the grain department also guarantees a sufficient supply of duck feed.

    吉首农民大量繁殖鸭子
    湘西苗族自治州吉首县二百多个苗汉农业生产合作社，计划今年繁殖鸭子二十万只。
    养鸭是吉首县苗汉农民历来收入很大的一宗副业。“乾州板鸭”——吉首县原名乾城县，县城设在乾州——肉美味香，在湘西地区享有盛名。但在过去，分散经营的农民抽不出过多的劳动力来大量养鸭。今年，吉首县90％的苗汉农民参加了农业社，劳力有了剩余，许多社里专门组织了孵鸭、养鸭小组。为了支援发展养鸭生产，县农场和供销合作社组织了孵鸭能手，计划今年孵鸭十五万多只，供应农业社，同时粮食部门也保证充分供给养鸭饲料。
