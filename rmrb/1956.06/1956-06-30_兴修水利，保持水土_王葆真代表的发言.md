Water Conservancy Construction and Soil Conservation
——Speech by Representative Wang Baozhen

I fully agree with the budget report of Vice Premier Li Xiannian and the reports of Minister Liao and Vice Chairman Peng. From the inspection work led by the Standing Committee, I have gained an understanding of the correctness of the model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives. It is particularly important to list "water conservancy construction and soil conservation" as the first item in the measures for increasing production.

I have seen the rural water conservancy work in several advanced collectivized areas. Here is how it is being carried out:

I. The Relationship Between Collectivization and Water Conservancy Work:

	1. The collective labor force and the division of labor have made solutions easier.
	2. Funding for water conservancy projects, whether entirely from the cooperative or through joint public-private efforts, is also easily resolved.
	3. Land needed for water conservancy used to be difficult to obtain, but after advanced collectivization, it is no longer a problem.
	4. Water disputes were numerous in the past, but they have been basically resolved after collectivization.
	5. Collectivization has promoted water conservancy work; water conservancy work has also consolidated collectivization.

For example, in Shuangying Township, Funing County, the township party secretary planned to open 156 ditches during the primary cooperative stage. However, due to private land ownership, the masses could not agree, and only half a river was opened. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, when the plan was brought up again, it was not only approved but also completed during the past winter and spring.

II. The Labor Enthusiasm of the Masses for Water Conservancy Projects:

	1. Suoshe Township, Jiangning County: In the winter and spring seasons, 352 ponds, 27 dams, and 62 diversion ditches were repaired. Twelve temporary small reservoirs were built for water storage in fields, totaling 120,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Each laborer contributed more than 50 workdays.
	2. Huangjinba Cooperative in the suburbs of Yangzhou City: All 735 male and female laborers in the cooperative contributed more than 31,000 workdays for the power irrigation canal. In addition to the work of operating machinery, they completed more than 18,600 cubic meters of earthwork and supported Duntang Cooperative with more than 2,500 cubic meters of earthwork. The construction of branch canals and pools was not even included in the calculation. Each laborer contributed 46 workdays, day and night, all on a voluntary basis. They all said they were willing to do it for irrigating their own fields.
	3. Shipi Township, Kunshan County: 1,188 full and semi-laborers opened 63 ditches and repaired 8,450 zhang of dike banks. All water conservancy projects totaled 61,625 cubic meters of earthwork, with each laborer contributing 38 days of voluntary work. The masses said: "Opening ditches and repairing dikes is like strengthening national defense." The three-year plan was completed in one year.
	4. Women's Reservoir in Zhuji County: After collectivization, women in Zhuji County built dozens of reservoirs. The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department did not encourage this, as they were concerned about the women's physical strength. However, the women's enthusiasm for labor was high, and they wanted to do it.

III. Methods and Benefits of Farmland Water Conservancy Projects:

	1. Hilly Areas of Jiangning County: Small ponds were transformed into large ponds, stagnant ponds into living ponds, and ponds were connected and merged. Large ponds became reservoirs, and stone dams were enlarged, deepened, and thickened, focusing on water storage for drought prevention and drainage as a secondary function.
The Suoshe Township has more than 11,000 mu of irrigated and dry land, which used to suffer from severe droughts and floods. The current project can store 2.6 million cubic meters of water, ensuring irrigation for 60 days without rain. With another 50,000 cubic meters of earthwork, water and drought disasters can be basically eliminated. In the past, double-cropping rice could not be grown due to lack of water, but now it can be tried.
	2. Hill Areas of Shugang and Huangjinba in Yangzhou City: Two-story power irrigation stations were newly built. The lower level has four pumps that draw water from the Grand Canal to a height of nine zhang to irrigate the main canal. About a li away is the upper-level electric pumping station with three machines that pump the water from the main canal up another nine zhang, totaling eighteen zhang high, for gravity irrigation to the top of the hill.
There is a saying near Shugang: "With water, there is grain; without water, you have to sell your wife and daughter." The masses warmly support the electric irrigation project. The project can irrigate 19,000 mu of land, increase grain production by 3.8 million jin, valued at 260,000 yuan. The investment of 340,000 yuan can be recovered in one and a half years.
	3. Lowlands and Highlands in the Suburbs of Suzhou City: The Hengtang Village in the lowlands of Suzhou has repaired the dike project; the Hengshan Cooperative in the highlands has built ponds and dams. It is said that in terms of flood control, dikes of more than 50 mu can withstand the typhoons of 1954 without collapsing or breaching. In terms of drought resistance, there will be no reduction in production for 40 days without rain.
	4. Shipi Township, Kunshan, is a lowland area downstream of Taihu Lake, with dense ditches and rivers. Large dikes have medium dikes inside them, and medium dikes have separated ditches inside them. Many waterwheels and windmills are busy with irrigation and drainage work. Last year, the average yield per mu for both rice and wheat was 570 jin. This year, the planned average yield per mu for wheat is 200 jin, and for rice, it is 650 jin. There are many rivers and ditches in Kunshan County. It is said that the county's grain output ranks among the top in the country.

I also inspected the artificial rainfall station, the power irrigation network, and the Red Star Cooperative in the suburbs of Shanghai, and Wuxing in Zhejiang, all of which have made new achievements in water conservancy work. This proves that in the advanced collectivized areas, under the leadership of party and government at all levels, water conservancy work has seen great development and achievements.

What is particularly gratifying is that, with the development of socialist construction, water conservancy work has been given more importance. Water conservancy workers have made great progress in studying water conservancy plans and have important opinions. The Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Department said that water conservancy plans should be given the highest priority as a measure for increasing production, and this year Jiangsu's water conservancy work has made great progress. The Suzhou Water Conservancy Section said that national basin planning and regional planning must be combined, and suggested that the higher authorities quickly determine the plan in the Yangtze River area so that the region can quickly make arrangements. It also requested that ports and gates be properly built in the unified planning of the Yangtze River dikes. The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department plans to complete basin planning and regional planning ahead of schedule. It also hopes to reflect to the central government that a water conservancy department should be attached to Zhejiang University, and that some civil engineering professors should be retained in order to train more technical cadres. Water should not all flow into the sea, but should be stored as the wealth of the country.

The Shanghai Water Conservancy Section feels that the most difficult problems are tidal flooding of fields, river siltation, and sand sedimentation, which accumulate more than one million mu every year. It is necessary to use 500,000 to 700,000 workdays every year to clear the silt. It hopes to reflect to the higher authorities the need to strengthen coastal defense. Moreover, the water conservancy administrative system in Shanghai is not unified, which hinders water conservancy work.

Due to the above inspections in various places, this is an extremely valuable learning experience for me, because I have seen that every pond, dam, ditch, dike, and every irrigation and drainage tool is directly related to the people's happy life, related to drought and flood disasters, crop yields, industrial raw materials, and industrial and commercial tax revenues. Every year, we see tens of millions of mu of fields and crops withering or dying from waterlogging, suffering serious losses. This is a natural disaster, but we should fight against natural disasters for the people. Therefore, I want to take the elimination of water and drought disasters within twelve years as the focus of my inspection work, and want to find a way from the interrelationship of ponds, dams, ditches, dikes, reservoirs, rivers, and lakes. In wind and rain, I climb mountains, stepping on muddy field ridges, walking for three or four hours, which I find more interesting than dancing on a slippery floor. I am not a water conservancy worker, nor a water conservancy scholar. I know too little about water conservancy academics. But I am a representative elected from Hebei Province. To eliminate harm and promote benefits for the country and the region, I should fulfill the responsibility of the people and contribute my own opinions without reservation. Based on the actual situation, I put forward the following opinions:

I. In order to build water conservancy nearby and lay the foundation for increasing production, farmers are willing and able to contribute 40 to 50 days of voluntary labor per year. This is a great force to ensure the elimination of water and drought disasters.

II. Well-digging can resist drought, but it cannot store water or prevent waterlogging. If small reservoirs, ponds, dams, ditches, and dikes are added, regional drought and waterlogging disasters can be solved without a large amount of funding. If included in the overall regional plan and vigorously promoted, most regional drought and waterlogging disasters can also be solved. This does not hinder the planning of large reservoirs and river basins, but rather has a mutually supportive effect. It is a method that is more numerous, faster, better, and more economical.

III. Large and small reservoirs solve mountain floods, and ditches and ponds solve internal waterlogging. They can store water to prevent drought and drain water to prevent waterlogging. Many areas have not yet fully recognized the effectiveness of ditches and ponds, resulting in occasional internal waterlogging in the area that has not been resolved.

IV. Ditches, ridges, and various small water conservancy projects also require overall regional planning, adapting to local conditions, and paying attention to technology and specifications. In recent years, water conservancy work in the North has gradually started. However, some counties and districts are making crude and shoddy products with poor quality, which cannot fully exert their effectiveness and need to be reworked.

I fully agree with Representative Xu Kai's speech. I think it is the most effective way to improve alkaline land. In the rural areas of Ninghe and Gaomi counties, there is a method of digging ditches to wash away alkali, which has been effective for many years. I introduced it in my proposal at the Second Session of the National People's Congress. Now, Representative Xu, based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, has created a scientific theory that can solve the problem of alkaline land. I hope to vigorously promote and actively implement it.

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the brilliant achievements of water conservancy construction in our country are already well known. However, if a small number of water conservancy personnel consider and accept the reasonable suggestions of the masses more humbly, some water conservancy projects may be done better, without having to review them again and again without being able to modify them. I also hope to further develop a national water conservancy network plan, of course not limited to one or two years. Last year, I inspected the small water-forest ditch network in Yuanyang County, Henan. This year, I saw several counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with interconnected ditches and ponds, connecting to the river and flowing into the sea, like several water networks woven, all playing a significant role in water conservancy, agriculture, and transportation. The rainfall in the North is less, of course, not like in the South. However, ditches and ponds can also reduce drought and waterlogging disasters in the North. I saw old ditches near Dingxian and Baiquan in Xingtai County, which benefited the present day. I deeply feel that water conservancy in the North needs to be improved and created. Last year, I visited the Yellow River treatment exhibition, which showed that the Yellow River already has a water conservancy network plan. I hope to gradually develop a national water conservancy network, which not only includes the basins of large rivers, small rivers, and streams, but also extends from the peaks of the Kunlun Mountains in the west to the coast of the Pacific Ocean in the east, all included in the water conservancy network. The mainland plains, thousands of hills, lakes, and swamps should all be adapted to local conditions, dotted like stars, divided into districts and connected, so that the rainwater of every mountain and every mu of land can be stored and utilized to serve the people. Adjusting storage, drainage, increase, and decrease at any time, making it only beneficial and not harmful, we can completely control water and drought disasters and master the fate of water conservancy. Our country's beloved mountains and rivers will present a richer, more magnificent force, and emit a brighter, more beautiful, solemn, and splendid light due to the socialist transformation, teaching people to cherish it with infinite and profound love and feel the glory of great construction.

    兴修水利，保持水土
    ——王葆真代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理的预决算报告，和廖部长、彭副委员长的报告，我从常委会领导的视察工作中，获得了认识高级农业生产合作社示范章程的正确性，特别重要的是把“兴修水利，保持水土”，列为增产措施的第一项。
    我看过几个高级合作化地区的农村水利工作。它是如何地进行：
    一，合作化与水利工作的关系：
    1、劳动力集体，与分工使用，获得了便利解决。
    2、水利工程的资金或全由社出或民办公助，亦容易解决。
    3、水利需用土地过去困难，高级化后，不成问题。
    4、水利纠纷过去很多，合作化后基本解决。
    5、合作化推动了水利工作；水利工作也巩固了合作化。
    例如阜宁县双营乡在初级社时，乡支书曾作计划要开一百五十六条沟，由于土地私有，群众搞不通，只开了半条河。等高级社成立，重新提出来，不但通过了，而且在去冬今春施工，都已经完工了。
    二、群众对水利工程的劳动积极性：
    1、江宁县索墅乡：在冬春两季，修了三百五十二个塘、二十七道坝，开了六十二条引水沟，作了临时小水库——屯水田十二个，共做了十二万土方的工程。每一个劳力负担五十多个工。
    2、扬州市郊黄金坝社，全社男女劳力共七百三十五人，为电力灌溉渠出了三万一千多劳动日，除了运转机器工作外，做了一万八千六百多方土，并支援墩塘社二千五百多方土，开支渠、水池尚未计算在内。每劳力负担四十六天工，夜以继日，皆系义务工，他们都说，为自己灌田，心甘情愿。
    3、昆山县石牌乡整半劳力一千一百八十八人，开沟六十三条，修圩岸八千四百五十丈，各项水利工程共做土方六万一千六百二十五方，每一劳力负担三十八天义务工。群众说：开好沟渠、修好圩岸，等于巩固国防。把三年的规划，一年完成了。
    4、诸暨县妇女水库：合作化后，诸暨县妇女修了几十个水库，浙江水利厅并不希望如此做，因为照顾妇女体力。但是妇女劳动情绪高涨，她们要如此做。
    三、农田水利工程的方式与效益。
    1、江宁县丘陵地区，小塘改大塘，死塘改活塘，连塘、并塘、大塘变水库，修塘筑坝，石塘堰加大、加深、加厚。以蓄水防旱为主，以排水为副。
    索墅乡水旱田一万一千多亩，过去常受着严重的旱灾及水灾，现在工程效益可存蓄二百六十万方水，保住六十天不下雨，都可自流灌溉。再作五万方土的工程即可基本上消灭水旱灾害。过去无水，不能种双季稻，现在可以试种。
    2、扬州市蜀冈、黄金坝丘陵地区，新建电力灌溉站两层，下层四台抽水机，吸引运河水至九丈高，灌注干沟。行里许为上层电灌站，三台机器，再吸引干沟的水翻上九丈，共翻水十八丈高，至冈顶，为自流灌溉。
    蜀冈附近传说：“有水就有粮，无水就卖老婆娘”。群众对电灌工程热烈拥护，工程效益，可灌一万九千亩田，可增产三百八十万斤粮，价值二十六万元，投资三十四万元，一年半可以收回成本。
    3、苏州市郊的低地与高地：苏州低地横塘村修好了圩堤工程；高地横山社修建塘坝。据说在防洪方面，五十亩以上的圩堤遇到1954年的台风，保证不倒塌，不缺口。在抗旱方面，四十天不下雨，保证不减产。
    4、昆山石牌乡为太湖下游的低地，沟洫、河道密布，大圩之内有中圩，中圩之内有隔沟。许多水车、风车忙于灌溉和排水工作。去年稻、麦两季平均亩产五百七十斤，今年计划小麦平均亩产二百斤，稻亩产六百五十斤。昆山县境河道沟洫甚多，据说这县粮产额数在全国各县的前列。
    我又视察了上海市郊的人工降雨站，电力灌溉网，及红星社，和浙江的吴兴，都在水利工作上作出了新的成绩。这证明了在高级合作化的区域，由于各级党政的领导，兴修水利工作是有了很大的发展和成就。
    尤可喜的，随着社会主义建设的发展，都把水利工作重视起来，水利工作人员研究水利计划，都有很大的进步，和重要的意见。江苏水利厅说：把水利计划应当重视为增产措施的第一位，今年江苏水利工作有了很大的开展。苏州市水利科说：国家流域规划和地区规划必须结合起来，建议上级在长江地区迅速确定规划，以便地区迅速安排。并要求在江堤统一规划中适当地并港建闸。浙江水利厅拟将流域规划、区域规划提前完成。并希望反映中央在浙江大学附设水利系，留一部分土木系教授，以便培养更多技术干部。应当不要让水量都流在海里，要把水当做国家的财富蓄积起来。
    上海市水利科最感觉困难的是潮水淹田，河道淤塞，沙泥沉淀，每年淤积一百多万亩，每年须用五十万至七十万工来清理淤淀，希望反映上级加强海防。并且上海市水利行政系统不统一，水利工作，有些滞碍。
    由于以上的各地视察，对我说来，是至极宝贵的学习，因为我看到每一个塘、坝、沟、圩和每一个灌溉、排水工具都是直接关系到人民的生活幸福，关系到旱潦灾害、农作物的产量、工业的原料、工商业的税源。我们年年看到几千万亩的田禾干枯或潦死，受到严重的损失。这是天灾，但是我们应当为人民战胜天灾。因此，我就想把怎样实现农业发展纲要十二年内消灭水旱灾害，作为视察工作的中心，要想从塘、坝、沟、圩和水库、河道、湖泊的互相关联中找出办法，风里雨里，缘木爬山，踏着泥泞的田埂，一走三四小时，觉着比滑着地板舞蹈还更有兴趣。我并不是水利工作者，也不是水利学者，关于水利学术知道的太少太少。但是我是河北省选出的一个代表，为国家、为地方除害兴利，应当尽到一个人民的责任，应当毫无保留地贡献出自己的意见。根据实际情况，我提出意见如下：
    一、为了就近兴修水利，打下增产的基础，农民一年负担四十天至五十天的义务工，是情愿的，是可能的。这是保证消灭水旱灾害的伟大力量。
    二、打井可以抗旱，但不能蓄水和防潦，若再加上修建小型水库和塘、坝、沟、圩等工程，不需要大批经费，即可以解决地区的旱潦灾害。如果纳在地区全面规划之中，大力推行，亦可以解决大部地区的旱潦灾害。这并不妨害大水库和河道流域的规划，而且有互助相成的作用。是又多、又快、又好、又省的一个办法。
    三、大、小水库解决山洪，沟洫、池塘解决内潦，可以蓄水防旱，也可以排水防潦，好多地区还未充分认识沟洫、池塘的效用，以致地区时有内潦，未能解决。
    四、沟洫畦田及各种小型水利工程也需要地区的全面规划，因地制宜，并讲求技术、规格。近年北方水利工作，逐渐开展起来。但有的县区粗制滥造，质量很差，不能充分发挥效力，需要返工。
    我对须恺代表的发言，极表同意。认为是改良碱地最有效的办法。在宁河、高密两县农村有挖沟洗碱的办法，多年著有成效。我在全国人民代表大会第二次会议提出建议中曾作过介绍。现在须代表本着苏联先进的经验，作成科学的理论，可以解决堿地问题。我希望大力宣传，积极推行。
    我国自解放以来在共产党的领导下，水利建设的辉煌成就，已是人所共知。但有少数水利负责人员如果更虚心地考虑接纳群众合理化的建议，如某些水利工程可能做的更好一些，不至徒然检讨一番，也修改不过来。我还希望更进一步作出全国水利网的计划，当然不限定一年两年。我去年视察河南原阳县小型的水林沟洫网，今年看到江浙几个县，沟、塘连贯，通江入海，似织成的几个水网，都起着水利上、农业上、交通上很大作用。北方雨量较少，当然不似江南。但沟洫池塘，在北方也可以减少旱潦灾害。我在定县和邢台县百泉附近，曾看见旧时沟洫，利及现代。我深深地感觉到北方水利，需要改善和创作。去年参观治黄展览，是黄河已有水利网的规划，我希望逐渐发展作出全国的水利网，不仅包括大江、大河、小江、小河的流域，西至昆仑山的顶峰，东至太平洋的海岸，都纳在水利网之内，大陆平原、万千丘陵、湖沼，均要因地制宜，星罗棋布，区划贯通，把每一个山头、每一亩地区的雨水，都蓄积利用起来，教它为人民服务。蓄泄增减，随时调济，只使为利，不使为害，我们就可以完全控制水旱灾害，掌握水利的命运。我们祖国可爱的山河，将因社会主义的改造，更呈现出富厚雄伟的力量，更发扬出明秀美丽庄严灿烂的光辉，教人们对它长怀着无限深厚的爱意，并感到伟大建设的光荣。
