The Datong City Handicraft Production Cooperative has launched a heated socialist competition. Many cooperative members are actively trying out new products, proposing rationalization suggestions, and improving tools. Since March, members have put forward forty-eight rationalization proposals, of which forty-two have been adopted. Zhao Zhigui of the Blacksmithing Cooperative created a tool for making teapot spouts called the "Semi-Circular Hand-Held Punch," which doubled efficiency. This cooperative also trial-produced a new product, the "Dual-Purpose Boiler," which can both cook food and boil water. After the First Carpentry Cooperative's saw shop changed from a single shift to two shifts, efficiency also increased by one and a half times.

    大同手工业合作社开展竞赛
    本报讯　大同市手工业生产合作社，展开了热烈的社会主义竞赛。许多社员积极试制新产品，提合理化建议，改进工具。三月份以来，社员们共提出四十八条合理化建议，已经采纳了四十二条。黑白铁业生产合作社的赵之桂，创造了打壶嘴的用具“半圆形手提冲”，提高效率一倍。这个社还试制了新产品“两用锅炉”，这种锅炉既可以做饭又可以烧水。第一木业社电锯车间改一班制为两班制以后，效率也提高了一倍半。
