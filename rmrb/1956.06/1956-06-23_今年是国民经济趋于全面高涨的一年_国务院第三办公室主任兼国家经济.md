This year is a year of overall national economic upsurge
--Speech by Bo Yibo, Director of the Third Office of the State Council and Director of the State Economic Commission
I would like to offer some opinions on several issues related to the implementation of the 1956 annual plan, particularly on the implementation of the heavy industry production and capital construction plans. Please correct me if I am wrong.
Industrial output value increased the most in previous years, with a capital construction growth rate of 62%
1956 is a year when China's national economy is trending towards an overall upsurge. The 1956 plan was formulated based on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, doing socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economically, and completing and overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Due to the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production increase, and due to the expansion of the scale of capital construction, this year, the national industrial production will have new development, especially the production of means of production will have a great increase. The planned total industrial output value in 1956 will increase by 8.8 billion yuan compared to 1955, with a growth rate of 19.7%. Among them, the production of means of production will increase by 23% this year compared to last year; the output value of the machine manufacturing industry will increase by 60% this year compared to last year. The increase in industrial output value is the largest in previous years, and the growth rate of industrial speed is the highest in the past three years. After completing this year's industrial production plan, the industrial production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1957 will be reached. In terms of capital construction, the workload this year will increase by 5.4 billion yuan compared to last year, with a growth rate of 62%. The capital construction workload this year will complete 33% of the Five-Year Plan, which is equal to the total workload of 1953 and 1954. The scale of construction is large and the growth rate is high, which is also unprecedented in recent years. After the planned capital construction workload this year is realized, plus the workload already completed in the previous three years, 87.6% of the capital construction tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan will be completed. In general, the 1956 plan is a positive but fully achievable plan. This plan embodies the universal desire of the Chinese people to strive to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and accelerate China's socialist construction.
Start to change the backward situation of not being able to manufacture cars and airplanes
The implementation of the 1956 plan is carried out in the high tide of the great socialist revolution in our country. This year, on the industrial production and capital construction fronts across the country, the upsurge of socialist labor emulation is unprecedented, and tens of thousands of advanced producers have emerged, a large number of rationalization proposals have been put forward, and new records have been continuously created. In this way, backward phenomena in our economic life have been changed in many aspects, and technical and economic indicators have been greatly improved. For example, from January to May this year, the cumulative total output value of national state-owned and joint state-private key industrial enterprises completed 102.8% of the plan, an increase of 28.5% compared to the same period last year. The percentage increase of each major product compared to the same period last year is as follows: electricity 13.8%, raw coal 14.7%, petroleum 17.3%, pig iron 30.9%, steel 52.5%, steelÊùê 28.4%, machine tools 140.5%. Among them, except for steel and steel products, which did not complete the plan, electricity, pig iron, metal cutting machine tools, etc., have all overfulfilled the plan. The cumulative capital construction workload completed 27% of the annual plan, an increase of 68.3% compared to the same period last year. The national blast furnace utilization coefficient has increased from 0.858 cubic meters/ton last year to 0.770 cubic meters/ton this year, reaching the level of the Soviet Union in 1955. The drilling speed of the Yumen Mining Bureau averaged 559.6 meters per month from January to April this year, exceeding the average drilling speed of 535.6 meters per month of the advanced Chinese petroleum drilling team in 1955. The trial production of new products has also made great achievements. The long-awaited domestically produced cars will begin mass production on October 1, and it is estimated that more than 1,300 vehicles can be produced this year; we have also successfully trial-produced jet aircraft engines. In this way, we began to change the backward situation that we could not manufacture a car or an airplane. In terms of geological exploration, there are also new discoveries. We have discovered a large iron ore with a prospective reserve of about 300 million tons in the Hexi Corridor area of Gansu; we have discovered a large iron ore with a prospective reserve of about 280 million tons in the Yanbian area of Sichuan. In this way, resources for establishing steel bases have been found in the northwest and southwest regions of our great motherland. New petroleum bases of great value have been discovered in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai and the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang. In this way, the assertion that China is a country with scarce petroleum resources cannot be established. All of these are very encouraging things. In addition, many departments and units, in the implementation of the plan, not only paid attention to "more and faster" but also emphasized "better and more economical." For example, the Dalian Steel Plant comprehensively completed the planned targets for output, output value, cost, labor productivity, new product trial production, quality, and profit in the first quarter, reversing the situation that the plan was not completed for 9 months last year, and there were no major personal injury accidents or equipment accidents throughout the quarter. Some departments and units, in view of the shortage of raw material supply, not only made efforts to save raw materials but also paid attention to verifying needs, checking warehouses, and adjusting use. All of this shows that after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao opposed right-leaning conservative thinking and put forward the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economically, how high is the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for building socialism, and how great power will be generated if this enthusiasm is given correct leadership. This foreshadows that the First Five-Year Plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule, and China's socialist construction will advance at the fastest speed!
Current shortcomings in production and capital construction
Building materials and equipment cannot keep up with the needs.
Some units one-sidedly pursue quantity.
Some material application plans are too high.
Enterprise management and organization work cannot keep up.
However, there are also many shortcomings in this year's production and capital construction work, such as: the disconnection between production, capital construction, and material supply, one-sided pursuit of more and faster, ignoring better and more economical, ignoring safety and poor collaboration, etc.
First of all, this year's capital construction tasks are quite heavy. Although the production of building materials and equipment has greatly improved compared to last year, it still cannot meet the needs of capital construction. The original planned growth rate of capital construction this year was 68%, the growth rate of steel was 46%, the growth rate of cement was 40%, and the growth rate of the machine manufacturing industry was 60%. There is a mismatch between production, capital construction, and material supply, resulting in the phenomenon of work stoppages awaiting materials and failure to start construction on schedule at many construction sites. According to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, in April this year, the projects that failed to start on schedule due to insufficient supply of building materials and equipment accounted for one-fifth of the projects that should have started in the same period. After May, with the increase in the number of construction units, this contradiction became more prominent.
Secondly, some units one-sidedly pursue quantity, ignore quality, ignore conservation, and ignore safe production. For example, the ash content of raw coal in various mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry is generally higher than last year, except for a few mines that have decreased compared to the past. In particular, more than 200 tons of mixed coal shipped by the Yangquan Mining Bureau to Suzhou in March this year were found to have too many stones when unloading. After screening, only half a ton of coal was found in the screened "lump coal", and the remaining half was stones. While one-sidedly pursuing quantity and ignoring quality, the cost plan was not well completed. For example, the original Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry completed 105.6% of the output value in the first quarter, 104.2% of labor productivity, but the cost exceeded the budget by 1.38%, and the profit plan was only 92.2%; the unit cost of raw coal in the Ministry of Coal Industry exceeded the budget by about 4%. In addition, after emphasizing more and faster, there is a general phenomenon of working overtime and ignoring safe production. For example, the national petroleum industry system worked a total of 336,991 hours of overtime in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 21% in overtime hours compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Due to crash production and rush tasks, some enterprises do not pay attention to safe production, resulting in continuous serious equipment accidents and personal injury accidents. For example, the number of deaths in the Ministry of Coal Industry system from January to May increased by 15% compared to the same period last year. The Electrical Materials Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry had a total of 105 equipment accidents in the first quarter, with 2,794 hours of downtime and losses of 70,362 yuan.
Again, in this year's plan, the tasks of pig iron, steel, steelÊùê, and cement production were originally relatively tight, but some units had artificially tight situations such as wanting more and fraudulently receiving goods, and the material application plans were too high. For example, the cold-drawn steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel has an investment of 183,000 yuan this year, but it applied for more than 900 tons of steel, equivalent to a value of 450,000 yuan, which is 1.5 times larger than the total investment. Some raw materials required for collaborative parts are repeatedly applied for by both the user factory and the manufacturer. For example, from January to April this year, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant outsourced 1,300 tons of castings for the entire plant, of which half were supplied with materials and half were not, but the plant and the outsourcing unit both submitted applications. The inventory of some enterprises exceeds the reserve quota, and even exceeds the total annual demand in 1956. For example, the actual inventory of small and medium-sized section steel in 437 factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry all exceeds the reserve quota by 2-3 times, and seamless steel pipes exceed the quota by nearly 20 times, equivalent to more than 1,400 days of usage. Even some individual units heard that the material supply was relatively tight, and hurriedly ordered "stop work and wait for materials." For example, the Screw Company under Shanghai City ordered a 6-day work stoppage, but when they looked at the warehouse, they found that there were still half a month's worth of materials.
Finally, in the high tide of socialism, many enterprises have broken the original balance within the enterprise due to the implementation of rationalization proposals, the emergence of new production records, the promotion of advanced experience, and the improvement of technical and economic indicators, resulting in new imbalances. The management and organization work of the enterprise cannot keep up, so there is a phenomenon of "waiting for materials, waiting for tools, waiting for collaborative parts, waiting for drawings," which prevents the enterprise from achieving rapid improvement on a new balance basis. In terms of the external aspects of the enterprise, due to the increase in production and capital construction indicators, especially the acceleration of the socialist transformation, the old collaborative relationships have changed, and new collaborative relationships have not yet been established. Therefore, certain imbalances have also occurred between relevant units and departments. For example, the original Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Coal, the Ministry of Electric Power, and other ministries requested the First Ministry of Machine Building to collaborate in manufacturing large forgings. Due to insufficient production capacity, the First Ministry of Machine Building also requested a reduction in the contracts that had already been signed. As for the production collaboration relationship between central state-owned industry and local state-owned industry, since the agricultural tool production task of local state-owned industry has greatly increased this year, the original collaborative task of central state-owned industry has been squeezed out; after the private machinery industry implemented the socialist transformation, it generally attaches importance to specialized manufacturing, and does not pay enough attention to the original collaborative products and local repair tasks. In this way, the production of some units has encountered serious difficulties.
After opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, there was another mood of impetuosity and rash advance.
The above problems arise, first, because after we opposed right-leaning conservative thinking in our planning work, we also developed a mood of impetuosity and rash advance. In some aspects, we did not start from possible conditions, resulting in some imbalances between production, capital construction, and material supply. The lesson learned from this is that in the future, when preparing plans, we must conduct serious research on China's existing production capacity and its possible growth, and at the same time, we must conduct repeated balance calculations to determine the proportional relationship of development in various departments. When carrying out this work, we need to rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses; without this, we will not be able to move forward; we also need the correct leadership of the Party and the state, so that our plans can truly become plans that promote positive factors, overcome negative factors, and reflect objective reality after balanced calculations. Without this, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses will not be fully developed and consolidated, and some links in the national economy will still be in danger of being artificially impacted and imbalanced. Second, the leading comrades of some enterprises lack a comprehensive and profound understanding of the policy of more, faster, better, more economically, and safe, and even oppose or separate them. These comrades do not understand that more, faster, better, more economical, and safe are all indispensable. If more and faster are separated from better and more economical, and separated from safe production, more and faster themselves will lose any positive meaning, which is harmful to the development of the national economy. Third, after the new high tide of production and construction arrives, our organization and management work cannot keep up. These problems must be solved.
Current work to be done
Conduct a comprehensive arrangement for capital construction
Guide the enthusiasm of the masses to improve technology
Improve the utilization rate of raw materials
Improve the material and cultural life of employees
Actively prepare and arrange the 1957 plan
In order to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the 1956 national plan, in addition to comprehensively implementing the policy of more, faster, better, more economically, and safe, strengthening political and ideological leadership, and improving work style, the following work should be carried out:
(1) In terms of capital construction, due to the shortage of technical material supply, the State Council has reduced the original planned 14.7 billion yuan of capital construction investment to 14 billion yuan. This indicator must be strived to be achieved. A comprehensive balance and arrangement should be made for design, equipment, building materials, and construction forces, under the condition of guaranteeing the construction of key projects, especially guaranteeing the construction of key projects that have a decisive significance for production this year and next year. Neither should a universal reduction or an average egalitarian approach of spreading out across the board be adopted; nor should only certain favorable conditions be emphasized, without considering the overall balance of design construction and material supply. Therefore, key projects with guaranteed material supply and technical strength should be started quickly; those with no certainty or little certainty in material supply and technical strength should actively create conditions for starting construction, instead of blindly starting construction and causing passivity; projects with no conditions at all should be reduced. In order to change the situation that capital construction plans in previous years often could not be fully completed, a reserve project system has been officially established since this year. After the reserve construction projects are approved by the State Council, various departments can uniformly rank, mutually adjust, and construct according to the degree of importance and urgency between formal projects and reserve projects; at the same time, a portion of construction projects is reserved, so that construction can be carried out immediately when design construction and material supply are guaranteed. The expansion and renovation of enterprises in some coastal cities, such as those with less investment and greater returns, can also be considered for inclusion in this year's construction projects; in addition, some construction units, such as those that have been delayed due to waiting for drawings or steel and cement, can first build a part of the brick and wood structure houses that serve the lives of employees. In the units under construction, the responsibility of the leadership should be to guide the masses to improve project quality, save raw materials, ensure safe construction, and strive to put into production on schedule, in order to achieve the purpose of quickly exerting the effect of investment.
(2) In terms of industrial production, since this year's industrial production tasks, especially the heavy industry production tasks, are very heavy, the responsibility of the leadership lies in guiding the labor enthusiasm of the masses to improve technology, improve quality, increase variety, implement process regulations, strengthen collaboration and coordination, improve labor organization, implement safe production, and overcome weak links. Production units that one-sidedly pursue quantity, but whose product quality and variety specifications do not meet the needs, should lead the masses to improve technology, strengthen technical measures, strengthen the trial production and production of new products, improve product quality, and increase variety specifications. All products must undergo strict inspection, and any products that do not meet the specifications are not allowed to leave the factory; if there are no quality standards, the relevant agencies should formulate them quickly; enterprises with backward equipment and technology should continue to carry out technological transformation within the possible scope, so that product quality can be gradually improved decisively. For the production of certain mechanical products, since the supply of raw materials this year is relatively tight, it is necessary to achieve a balance between supply, production, and sales under the conditions of clearing inventory materials, verifying material needs, reducing consumption quotas, and ensuring product quality and specifications, based on equipment capacity, supply and sales conditions, technical strength, and collaboration conditions. Products that do not need to expand production temporarily and whose raw material supply is tight cannot blindly increase production and should carry out production evenly according to the plan. Products that are urgently needed for production and capital construction, such as pig iron, steelÊùê, cement, and wood, must lead the masses to work hard to tap potential strength and take effective measures to actively increase production under the conditions of guaranteeing variety specifications quality and delivery time. In particular, the production of steelÊùê and cement must take emergency measures to strive to increase production on the basis of the original state-set plan. All enterprises should pay attention to solving the new imbalance problems that have emerged in the socialist upsurge and organize balanced production between various processes and workshops. For production units that have collaborative relationships with relevant departments, the collaborative relationships should be adapted to the development of production according to the needs of production tasks. The original collaboration relationship between central and local enterprises should be rectified and re-arranged; after the joint state-private mechanical industry, in addition to undertaking the necessary specialized manufacturing tasks, it should also attach importance to and undertake the manufacturing of collaborative products and local repair tasks. For major collaboration issues, the relevant national economic agencies should resolve them. All collaborative tasks should be incorporated into the plans of each unit separately.
(3) In terms of material supply, according to the material balance situation this year, in addition to the production departments striving to increase production and the Ministry of Foreign Trade striving to import more for all urgently needed materials, each user department should vigorously promote advanced experience, implement rationalization proposals, and improve the utilization rate of raw materials; the infrastructure departments should use local materials as much as possible to expand the source of materials. We should ascertain inventory, organize adjustment, provide mutual support, and fully exploit the potential of materials. This year, all departments should complete the requirements for saving 4% in production and 25% in capital construction in the use of steel. Special attention should be paid to opposing false reports and fraudulent receipts and the phenomenon of using generously and sparingly, preventing the waste and backlog of materials, and avoiding artificial tensions. At the same time, the state should establish a reserve system for important materials to regulate the contradictions between production and supply. The state's planned reserves of important materials cannot be regarded as a backlog of materials. On the contrary, this reserve is a necessary material guarantee for China's planned, proportional development of the economy and for preventing certain unexpected events.
(4) It is necessary to improve the material and cultural life of employees on the basis of developing production and according to possible conditions. All departments and enterprises should strive to do a good job in the wage reform of employees (especially the implementation of the piece-rate wage system) and rating work, and at the same time, improve the welfare facilities such as housing, canteens, and medical care of employees as much as possible. The lives of employees must be gradually improved on the basis of production development and increased labor productivity. The improvement of the lives of employees will further encourage the labor enthusiasm of the masses and promote the increase of labor productivity.
(5) Finally, I would also like to talk about the compilation of the 1957 plan. 1957 is the last year of China's First Five-Year Plan. Actively preparing and arranging the 1957 plan is of great significance for completing and overfulfilling the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and for doing the necessary preparatory work for the Second Five-Year Plan. The 1957 plan must be based on the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, starting from a comprehensive balance, and the main indicators of the plan should be made more accurate and realistic. At the same time, we should strive to issue the draft plan as early as possible in order to facilitate the rational arrangement of economic and cultural undertakings.
Due to our lack of experience and low level in planning work, there are many shortcomings in planning work. However, with the rapid development of the national economy and the increasing role of the basic socialist economic law in China's national economy, our planning work level must be greatly improved in order to enable the national economic plan to play a greater guiding role in the entire national economic activity, thereby accelerating the progress of China's socialist construction.
