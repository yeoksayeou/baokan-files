This year is a year of overall national economic upsurge
--Speech by Bo Yibo, Director of the Third Office of the State Council and Director of the State Economic Commission
I would like to offer some opinions on several issues related to the implementation of the 1956 annual plan, particularly on the implementation of the heavy industry production and capital construction plans. Please correct me if I am wrong.
Industrial output value increased the most in previous years, with a capital construction growth rate of 62%
1956 is a year when China's national economy is trending towards an overall upsurge. The 1956 plan was formulated based on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, doing socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economically, and completing and overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Due to the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production increase, and due to the expansion of the scale of capital construction, this year, the national industrial production will have new development, especially the production of means of production will have a great increase. The planned total industrial output value in 1956 will increase by 8.8 billion yuan compared to 1955, with a growth rate of 19.7%. Among them, the production of means of production will increase by 23% this year compared to last year; the output value of the machine manufacturing industry will increase by 60% this year compared to last year. The increase in industrial output value is the largest in previous years, and the growth rate of industrial speed is the highest in the past three years. After completing this year's industrial production plan, the industrial production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1957 will be reached. In terms of capital construction, the workload this year will increase by 5.4 billion yuan compared to last year, with a growth rate of 62%. The capital construction workload this year will complete 33% of the Five-Year Plan, which is equal to the total workload of 1953 and 1954. The scale of construction is large and the growth rate is high, which is also unprecedented in recent years. After the planned capital construction workload this year is realized, plus the workload already completed in the previous three years, 87.6% of the capital construction tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan will be completed. In general, the 1956 plan is a positive but fully achievable plan. This plan embodies the universal desire of the Chinese people to strive to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and accelerate China's socialist construction.
Start to change the backward situation of not being able to manufacture cars and airplanes
The implementation of the 1956 plan is carried out in the high tide of the great socialist revolution in our country. This year, on the industrial production and capital construction fronts across the country, the upsurge of socialist labor emulation is unprecedented, and tens of thousands of advanced producers have emerged, a large number of rationalization proposals have been put forward, and new records have been continuously created. In this way, backward phenomena in our economic life have been changed in many aspects, and technical and economic indicators have been greatly improved. For example, from January to May this year, the cumulative total output value of national state-owned and joint state-private key industrial enterprises completed 102.8% of the plan, an increase of 28.5% compared to the same period last year. The percentage increase of each major product compared to the same period last year is as follows: electricity 13.8%, raw coal 14.7%, petroleum 17.3%, pig iron 30.9%, steel 52.5%, steel材 28.4%, machine tools 140.5%. Among them, except for steel and steel products, which did not complete the plan, electricity, pig iron, metal cutting machine tools, etc., have all overfulfilled the plan. The cumulative capital construction workload completed 27% of the annual plan, an increase of 68.3% compared to the same period last year. The national blast furnace utilization coefficient has increased from 0.858 cubic meters/ton last year to 0.770 cubic meters/ton this year, reaching the level of the Soviet Union in 1955. The drilling speed of the Yumen Mining Bureau averaged 559.6 meters per month from January to April this year, exceeding the average drilling speed of 535.6 meters per month of the advanced Chinese petroleum drilling team in 1955. The trial production of new products has also made great achievements. The long-awaited domestically produced cars will begin mass production on October 1, and it is estimated that more than 1,300 vehicles can be produced this year; we have also successfully trial-produced jet aircraft engines. In this way, we began to change the backward situation that we could not manufacture a car or an airplane. In terms of geological exploration, there are also new discoveries. We have discovered a large iron ore with a prospective reserve of about 300 million tons in the Hexi Corridor area of Gansu; we have discovered a large iron ore with a prospective reserve of about 280 million tons in the Yanbian area of Sichuan. In this way, resources for establishing steel bases have been found in the northwest and southwest regions of our great motherland. New petroleum bases of great value have been discovered in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai and the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang. In this way, the assertion that China is a country with scarce petroleum resources cannot be established. All of these are very encouraging things. In addition, many departments and units, in the implementation of the plan, not only paid attention to "more and faster" but also emphasized "better and more economical." For example, the Dalian Steel Plant comprehensively completed the planned targets for output, output value, cost, labor productivity, new product trial production, quality, and profit in the first quarter, reversing the situation that the plan was not completed for 9 months last year, and there were no major personal injury accidents or equipment accidents throughout the quarter. Some departments and units, in view of the shortage of raw material supply, not only made efforts to save raw materials but also paid attention to verifying needs, checking warehouses, and adjusting use. All of this shows that after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao opposed right-leaning conservative thinking and put forward the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economically, how high is the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for building socialism, and how great power will be generated if this enthusiasm is given correct leadership. This foreshadows that the First Five-Year Plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule, and China's socialist construction will advance at the fastest speed!
Current shortcomings in production and capital construction
Building materials and equipment cannot keep up with the needs.
Some units one-sidedly pursue quantity.
Some material application plans are too high.
Enterprise management and organization work cannot keep up.
However, there are also many shortcomings in this year's production and capital construction work, such as: the disconnection between production, capital construction, and material supply, one-sided pursuit of more and faster, ignoring better and more economical, ignoring safety and poor collaboration, etc.
First of all, this year's capital construction tasks are quite heavy. Although the production of building materials and equipment has greatly improved compared to last year, it still cannot meet the needs of capital construction. The original planned growth rate of capital construction this year was 68%, the growth rate of steel was 46%, the growth rate of cement was 40%, and the growth rate of the machine manufacturing industry was 60%. There is a mismatch between production, capital construction, and material supply, resulting in the phenomenon of work stoppages awaiting materials and failure to start construction on schedule at many construction sites. According to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, in April this year, the projects that failed to start on schedule due to insufficient supply of building materials and equipment accounted for one-fifth of the projects that should have started in the same period. After May, with the increase in the number of construction units, this contradiction became more prominent.
Secondly, some units one-sidedly pursue quantity, ignore quality, ignore conservation, and ignore safe production. For example, the ash content of raw coal in various mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry is generally higher than last year, except for a few mines that have decreased compared to the past. In particular, more than 200 tons of mixed coal shipped by the Yangquan Mining Bureau to Suzhou in March this year were found to have too many stones when unloading. After screening, only half a ton of coal was found in the screened "lump coal", and the remaining half was stones. While one-sidedly pursuing quantity and ignoring quality, the cost plan was not well completed. For example, the original Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry completed 105.6% of the output value in the first quarter, 104.2% of labor productivity, but the cost exceeded the budget by 1.38%, and the profit plan was only 92.2%; the unit cost of raw coal in the Ministry of Coal Industry exceeded the budget by about 4%. In addition, after emphasizing more and faster, there is a general phenomenon of working overtime and ignoring safe production. For example, the national petroleum industry system worked a total of 336,991 hours of overtime in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 21% in overtime hours compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Due to crash production and rush tasks, some enterprises do not pay attention to safe production, resulting in continuous serious equipment accidents and personal injury accidents. For example, the number of deaths in the Ministry of Coal Industry system from January to May increased by 15% compared to the same period last year. The Electrical Materials Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry had a total of 105 equipment accidents in the first quarter, with 2,794 hours of downtime and losses of 70,362 yuan.
Again, in this year's plan, the tasks of pig iron, steel, steel材, and cement production were originally relatively tight, but some units had artificially tight situations such as wanting more and fraudulently receiving goods, and the material application plans were too high. For example, the cold-drawn steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel has an investment of 183,000 yuan this year, but it applied for more than 900 tons of steel, equivalent to a value of 450,000 yuan, which is 1.5 times larger than the total investment. Some raw materials required for collaborative parts are repeatedly applied for by both the user factory and the manufacturer. For example, from January to April this year, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant outsourced 1,300 tons of castings for the entire plant, of which half were supplied with materials and half were not, but the plant and the outsourcing unit both submitted applications. The inventory of some enterprises exceeds the reserve quota, and even exceeds the total annual demand in 1956. For example, the actual inventory of small and medium-sized section steel in 437 factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry all exceeds the reserve quota by 2-3 times, and seamless steel pipes exceed the quota by nearly 20 times, equivalent to more than 1,400 days of usage. Even some individual units heard that the material supply was relatively tight, and hurriedly ordered "stop work and wait for materials." For example, the Screw Company under Shanghai City ordered a 6-day work stoppage, but when they looked at the warehouse, they found that there were still half a month's worth of materials.
Finally, in the high tide of socialism, many enterprises have broken the original balance within the enterprise due to the implementation of rationalization proposals, the emergence of new production records, the promotion of advanced experience, and the improvement of technical and economic indicators, resulting in new imbalances. The management and organization work of the enterprise cannot keep up, so there is a phenomenon of "waiting for materials, waiting for tools, waiting for collaborative parts, waiting for drawings," which prevents the enterprise from achieving rapid improvement on a new balance basis. In terms of the external aspects of the enterprise, due to the increase in production and capital construction indicators, especially the acceleration of the socialist transformation, the old collaborative relationships have changed, and new collaborative relationships have not yet been established. Therefore, certain imbalances have also occurred between relevant units and departments. For example, the original Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Coal, the Ministry of Electric Power, and other ministries requested the First Ministry of Machine Building to collaborate in manufacturing large forgings. Due to insufficient production capacity, the First Ministry of Machine Building also requested a reduction in the contracts that had already been signed. As for the production collaboration relationship between central state-owned industry and local state-owned industry, since the agricultural tool production task of local state-owned industry has greatly increased this year, the original collaborative task of central state-owned industry has been squeezed out; after the private machinery industry implemented the socialist transformation, it generally attaches importance to specialized manufacturing, and does not pay enough attention to the original collaborative products and local repair tasks. In this way, the production of some units has encountered serious difficulties.
After opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, there was another mood of impetuosity and rash advance.
The above problems arise, first, because after we opposed right-leaning conservative thinking in our planning work, we also developed a mood of impetuosity and rash advance. In some aspects, we did not start from possible conditions, resulting in some imbalances between production, capital construction, and material supply. The lesson learned from this is that in the future, when preparing plans, we must conduct serious research on China's existing production capacity and its possible growth, and at the same time, we must conduct repeated balance calculations to determine the proportional relationship of development in various departments. When carrying out this work, we need to rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses; without this, we will not be able to move forward; we also need the correct leadership of the Party and the state, so that our plans can truly become plans that promote positive factors, overcome negative factors, and reflect objective reality after balanced calculations. Without this, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses will not be fully developed and consolidated, and some links in the national economy will still be in danger of being artificially impacted and imbalanced. Second, the leading comrades of some enterprises lack a comprehensive and profound understanding of the policy of more, faster, better, more economically, and safe, and even oppose or separate them. These comrades do not understand that more, faster, better, more economical, and safe are all indispensable. If more and faster are separated from better and more economical, and separated from safe production, more and faster themselves will lose any positive meaning, which is harmful to the development of the national economy. Third, after the new high tide of production and construction arrives, our organization and management work cannot keep up. These problems must be solved.
Current work to be done
Conduct a comprehensive arrangement for capital construction
Guide the enthusiasm of the masses to improve technology
Improve the utilization rate of raw materials
Improve the material and cultural life of employees
Actively prepare and arrange the 1957 plan
In order to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the 1956 national plan, in addition to comprehensively implementing the policy of more, faster, better, more economically, and safe, strengthening political and ideological leadership, and improving work style, the following work should be carried out:
(1) In terms of capital construction, due to the shortage of technical material supply, the State Council has reduced the original planned 14.7 billion yuan of capital construction investment to 14 billion yuan. This indicator must be strived to be achieved. A comprehensive balance and arrangement should be made for design, equipment, building materials, and construction forces, under the condition of guaranteeing the construction of key projects, especially guaranteeing the construction of key projects that have a decisive significance for production this year and next year. Neither should a universal reduction or an average egalitarian approach of spreading out across the board be adopted; nor should only certain favorable conditions be emphasized, without considering the overall balance of design construction and material supply. Therefore, key projects with guaranteed material supply and technical strength should be started quickly; those with no certainty or little certainty in material supply and technical strength should actively create conditions for starting construction, instead of blindly starting construction and causing passivity; projects with no conditions at all should be reduced. In order to change the situation that capital construction plans in previous years often could not be fully completed, a reserve project system has been officially established since this year. After the reserve construction projects are approved by the State Council, various departments can uniformly rank, mutually adjust, and construct according to the degree of importance and urgency between formal projects and reserve projects; at the same time, a portion of construction projects is reserved, so that construction can be carried out immediately when design construction and material supply are guaranteed. The expansion and renovation of enterprises in some coastal cities, such as those with less investment and greater returns, can also be considered for inclusion in this year's construction projects; in addition, some construction units, such as those that have been delayed due to waiting for drawings or steel and cement, can first build a part of the brick and wood structure houses that serve the lives of employees. In the units under construction, the responsibility of the leadership should be to guide the masses to improve project quality, save raw materials, ensure safe construction, and strive to put into production on schedule, in order to achieve the purpose of quickly exerting the effect of investment.
(2) In terms of industrial production, since this year's industrial production tasks, especially the heavy industry production tasks, are very heavy, the responsibility of the leadership lies in guiding the labor enthusiasm of the masses to improve technology, improve quality, increase variety, implement process regulations, strengthen collaboration and coordination, improve labor organization, implement safe production, and overcome weak links. Production units that one-sidedly pursue quantity, but whose product quality and variety specifications do not meet the needs, should lead the masses to improve technology, strengthen technical measures, strengthen the trial production and production of new products, improve product quality, and increase variety specifications. All products must undergo strict inspection, and any products that do not meet the specifications are not allowed to leave the factory; if there are no quality standards, the relevant agencies should formulate them quickly; enterprises with backward equipment and technology should continue to carry out technological transformation within the possible scope, so that product quality can be gradually improved decisively. For the production of certain mechanical products, since the supply of raw materials this year is relatively tight, it is necessary to achieve a balance between supply, production, and sales under the conditions of clearing inventory materials, verifying material needs, reducing consumption quotas, and ensuring product quality and specifications, based on equipment capacity, supply and sales conditions, technical strength, and collaboration conditions. Products that do not need to expand production temporarily and whose raw material supply is tight cannot blindly increase production and should carry out production evenly according to the plan. Products that are urgently needed for production and capital construction, such as pig iron, steel材, cement, and wood, must lead the masses to work hard to tap potential strength and take effective measures to actively increase production under the conditions of guaranteeing variety specifications quality and delivery time. In particular, the production of steel材 and cement must take emergency measures to strive to increase production on the basis of the original state-set plan. All enterprises should pay attention to solving the new imbalance problems that have emerged in the socialist upsurge and organize balanced production between various processes and workshops. For production units that have collaborative relationships with relevant departments, the collaborative relationships should be adapted to the development of production according to the needs of production tasks. The original collaboration relationship between central and local enterprises should be rectified and re-arranged; after the joint state-private mechanical industry, in addition to undertaking the necessary specialized manufacturing tasks, it should also attach importance to and undertake the manufacturing of collaborative products and local repair tasks. For major collaboration issues, the relevant national economic agencies should resolve them. All collaborative tasks should be incorporated into the plans of each unit separately.
(3) In terms of material supply, according to the material balance situation this year, in addition to the production departments striving to increase production and the Ministry of Foreign Trade striving to import more for all urgently needed materials, each user department should vigorously promote advanced experience, implement rationalization proposals, and improve the utilization rate of raw materials; the infrastructure departments should use local materials as much as possible to expand the source of materials. We should ascertain inventory, organize adjustment, provide mutual support, and fully exploit the potential of materials. This year, all departments should complete the requirements for saving 4% in production and 25% in capital construction in the use of steel. Special attention should be paid to opposing false reports and fraudulent receipts and the phenomenon of using generously and sparingly, preventing the waste and backlog of materials, and avoiding artificial tensions. At the same time, the state should establish a reserve system for important materials to regulate the contradictions between production and supply. The state's planned reserves of important materials cannot be regarded as a backlog of materials. On the contrary, this reserve is a necessary material guarantee for China's planned, proportional development of the economy and for preventing certain unexpected events.
(4) It is necessary to improve the material and cultural life of employees on the basis of developing production and according to possible conditions. All departments and enterprises should strive to do a good job in the wage reform of employees (especially the implementation of the piece-rate wage system) and rating work, and at the same time, improve the welfare facilities such as housing, canteens, and medical care of employees as much as possible. The lives of employees must be gradually improved on the basis of production development and increased labor productivity. The improvement of the lives of employees will further encourage the labor enthusiasm of the masses and promote the increase of labor productivity.
(5) Finally, I would also like to talk about the compilation of the 1957 plan. 1957 is the last year of China's First Five-Year Plan. Actively preparing and arranging the 1957 plan is of great significance for completing and overfulfilling the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and for doing the necessary preparatory work for the Second Five-Year Plan. The 1957 plan must be based on the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, starting from a comprehensive balance, and the main indicators of the plan should be made more accurate and realistic. At the same time, we should strive to issue the draft plan as early as possible in order to facilitate the rational arrangement of economic and cultural undertakings.
Due to our lack of experience and low level in planning work, there are many shortcomings in planning work. However, with the rapid development of the national economy and the increasing role of the basic socialist economic law in China's national economy, our planning work level must be greatly improved in order to enable the national economic plan to play a greater guiding role in the entire national economic activity, thereby accelerating the progress of China's socialist construction.

    今年是国民经济趋于全面高涨的一年   
    ——国务院第三办公室主任兼国家经济
    委员会主任薄一波的发言
    我现就有关1956年度计划执行中的几个问题，特别是关于重工业生产和基本建设计划执行方面的一些问题，讲一些意见，请指正。工业产值增加是历年来最多的一年基本建设增长速度为62％
    1956年是我国国民经济趋于全面高涨的一年。1956年的计划是根据中共中央和毛主席关于反对右倾保守思想，把社会主义建设事业做得又多、又快、又好、又省的指示，及提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的要求制定的。由于农业合作化和农业增产的高潮，由于基本建设规模的扩大，今年，全国工业生产将有新的发展，特别是生产资料的生产有很大的增长。1956年全国工业总产值计划比1955年增加88亿元，增长速度为19.7％。其中，生产资料的生产，今年比去年增长23％；机器制造工业的产值，今年比去年增长60％。工业产值的增加是历年来最多的一年，工业速度的增长是近三年来最高的一年。完成了今年的工业生产计划之后，即达到了五年计划所规定的1957年的工业生产水平。在基本建设方面，今年的工作量比去年增加54亿元，增长速度为62％。今年一年的基本建设工作量将完成五年计划的33％，等于1953年和1954年两年工作量的总和。建设规模之大，增长速度之高，也是近年来所没有过的。今年的基本建设工作量计划实现后，再加上前三年已经完成的工作量，则第一个五年计划所规定的基本建设任务就将完成87.6％。从总的方面来说，1956年的计划是一个积极的但是完全可以实现的计划。这个计划，体现了我国人民争取提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划与加速我国社会主义建设的普遍愿望。开始改变不能制造汽车
  和飞机的落后情况
    1956年计划的执行，是在我国伟大的社会主义革命高潮中进行的。今年，全国在工业生产和基本建设战线上，社会主义劳动竞赛的热潮，空前高涨，成千成万的先进生产者，涌现出来了，合理化建议大量提出，新纪录不断出现。这样，就在许多方面改变了我们经济生活中的落后现象，大大提高了技术经济指标。例如今年一——五月份全国国营及公私合营重点工业企业总产值累计完成计划的102.8％，比去年同期增长28.5％。各主要产品与去年同期相比较，增长的比例如下：电力13.8％，原煤14.7％，石油17.3％，生铁30.9％，钢52.5％，钢材28.4％，机床140.5％。其中，除钢和钢材等没有完成计划外，电力、生铁、金属切削机床等都超额完成了计划。基本建设工作量累计完成年计划的27％，比去年同期增长68.3％。全国高炉利用系数已由去年的0.858立方公尺／吨，提高到今年的0.770立方公尺／吨，达到了苏联1955年的水平。玉门矿务局今年一——四月份钻机钻进速度平均每月为559.6公尺，超过了1955年我国石油先进钻井队每月平均钻进535.6公尺的速度。新产品的试制也有很大的成就。盼望已久的国产汽车，将在10月1日开始大量生产，今年预计可以出产1，300辆以上；喷气式飞机发动机，我们也已经试制成功了。这样，就开始改变着我们不能制造一辆汽车、一架飞机的落后情况。地质勘探方面，也有新的发现，我们在甘肃河西走廊地带发现了远景储量约3亿吨的大铁矿；在四川的盐边地区发现了远景储量约2.8亿吨的大铁矿。这样，在我们伟大祖国的西北和西南地区就找到了建立钢铁基地的资源。在青海的柴达木盆地和新疆的准噶尔盆地都发现了很有价值的新的石油基地。这样，那些说我国是一个石油资源贫乏的国家的论断，也就不能成立了。所有这些，都是非常振奋人心的事情。除此之外，不少部门和单位，在计划执行中，不但注意了“多、快”，而且重视
  了“好、省”。例如大连钢厂第一季度全面完成了产量、产值、成本、劳动生产率、新产品试制、质量、利润等计划指标，扭转了去年9个月未完成计划的局面，而且全季无重大人身事故和设备事故。有些部门和单位鉴于原材料供应的紧张，除努力节约原材料外，并注意了核实需要、清查仓库和调剂使用等工作。这一切表明：在中共中央和毛主席反对右倾保守思想，提出又多、又快、又好、又省的建设方针之后，我国人民建设社会主义的积极性是何等的高涨，而这种积极性只要加以正确的领导，将产生多么伟大的力量。这就预示着第一个五年计划必将提前完成和超额完成，我国社会主义建设事业，将以最快的速度前进！目前生产和基本建设中的缺点建筑材料和设备赶不上需要有些单位片面追求数量有的物资申请计划偏高企业管理和组织工作跟不上
    但是，在今年的生产和基本建设工作中，也有不少的缺点，如：生产、基本建设和物资供应工作的脱节，片面追求多和快，忽视好和省，忽视安全与协作不好等等。
    首先是今年的基本建设任务相当繁重，建筑材料和设备的生产虽较去年有很大的提高，但仍不能满足基本建设的需要。今年基本建设增长的速度原定为68％，钢材的增长速度为46％，水泥增长的速度为40％，机器制造业增长的速度为60％，在生产、基本建设与物资供应之间不相适应，以致许多工地发生停工待料和不能按期开工的现象。据国家统计局的统计，今年四月份由于建筑材料和设备供应不足而未能如期开工的项目，即占同期应开工项目的五分之一。五月以后随着开工单位的增多，这一矛盾更为突出。
    其次是某些单位片面追求数量、忽视质量、忽视节约和忽视安全生产。例如煤炭工业部所属各矿的原煤含?率，除少数矿较过去有所降低外，普遍较去年提高，特别是像阳泉矿务局在今年3月份运到苏州的200多吨混煤，卸车时发现石头太多，经过筛选，在筛出的一吨“块煤”中，煤只有半吨，剩下的一半都是石头。在片面追求数量忽视质量的同时，成本计划也完成得不好。例如原重工业部化工局第一季度产值完成了105.6％，劳动生产率完成了104.2％，成本反而超支1.38％，利润计划只完成92.2％；煤炭工业部原煤的单位成本约超支4％左右。此外，在强调多和快之后，普遍产生加班加点和忽视安全生产的现象。例如全国石油工业系统，今年第一季度加班加点共达336，991小时，比去年第四季度加班加点的工时增加21％。由于突击生产和赶任务，有些企业不重视安全生产，以致不断发生严重的设备事故和人身事故。例如煤炭工业部系统一——五月份的死亡人数，比去年同期增加15％。第一机械工业部电器材料局第一季度共发生设备事故105次，停工台时2，794小时，损失达70，362元。
    再次，今年计划中，生铁、钢、钢材和水泥生产的任务本来就比较紧张，但是，有些单位却存在着多要、冒领等人为紧张的情况，物资申请计划偏高。例如鞍钢的冷拔钢管厂，今年投资为18.3万元，但申请900余吨钢材，相当于45万元的价值，比全部投资还大1.5倍。有些协作制件所需要的原材料，需用厂和承制厂重复申请。例如上海机床厂今年一——四月份，全厂外包铸件1，300吨，其中供料和不供料的各占一半，但该厂与出包单位都提出申请。有些企业的库存量超过了储备定额，甚至超过了1956年全年的需用量。例如第一机械工业部所属437厂中小型型钢的实际库存量均超过储备定额2——3倍，无缝钢管则超过定额近20倍，相当于1，400多天的使用量。甚至有个别单位听说材料供应比较紧张，就慌忙下令“停工待料”。例如上海市所属螺丝公司下令停工6天以后，到仓库一看，才发现还有半个月的用料。
    最后，在社会主义高潮中，许多企业由于合理化建议的实施，生产新纪录的出现，先进经验的推广，技术经济指标的提高等等，使企业内部原有的平衡关系被打破，出现了新的不平衡，而企业的管理和组织工作跟不上，因而就产生了待材料，待工具，待协作制件，待图纸等“七等八待”的现象，使企业不能在新的平衡基础上获得迅速的提高。在企业的外部方面，由于生产和基本建设的指标提高，特别是社会主义改造的速度加快，旧的协作关系变化了，而新的协作关系尚未建立起来，于是在有关单位和部门之间，也发生了某些失调现象，例如原重工、二机、煤炭、电力等部要求一机部协作制造的大型锻件，一机部由于生产能力不足，对已经签订合同的，还要求削减。至于中央国营工业和地方国营工业之间的生产协作关系，由于今年地方国营工业的农具生产任务大大增加，原来承担的对中央国营工业的协作任务被挤掉了；私营机械工业在实行社会主义改造之后，一般重视专业制造，而对原来承制的协作产品和当地的修配任务，重视不够。这样，就使一些单位的生产，发生了严重的困难。反对右倾保守思想以后又产生急躁冒进的情绪
    上述问题的产生，第一是由于我们在计划工作中当反对了右倾保守思想之后又产生了急躁冒进的情绪。在某些方面，没有从可能的条件出发，以致在生产、基本建设和物资供应之间发生若干失调现象。从这里得到的教训是：今后在编制计划时，必须对于我国现有的生产能力及其可能的增长程度进行认真的研究，同时要经过反复的平衡计算，以确定各部门发展的比例关系。在进行这一工作时，既需要依靠广大群众的积极性和创造性，没有这一点，我们将寸步难行；又需要党和国家的正确领导，使我们的计划真正成为发扬积极因素，克服消极因素，经过平衡计算，能够反映客观实际的按比例发展的计划，没有这一点，群众的积极性和创造性将不能充分发挥和巩固，而国民经济的某些环节还有遭受人为冲击和失调的危险。第二是某些企业的领导同志对于多、快、好、省和安全的方针，以及它们之间的内在联系缺乏全面的、深刻的理解，甚至将它们对立或分割开来。这些同志不了解多、快、好、省和安全缺一不可，如果多和快脱离了好和省，脱离了安全生产，多和快本身将失去任何积极意义，这对国民经济的发展是有害的。第三是生产和建设的新高潮到来之后，我们在组织管理工作方面跟不上。这些问题，必须加以解决。
    当前应该进行的工作对基本建设进行全面安排把群众热情引向提高技术提高原材料的利用率改善职工物质文化生活积极准备和安排1957年计划
    为了保证1956年国家计划的完成和超额完成，除全面地贯彻多、快、好、省和安全的方针，加强政治思想领导，改进工作作风外，应进行以下的工作：
      （一）在基本建设方面，由于技术物资供应的紧张，国务院已将原定147亿元的基本建设投资，削减为140亿元，这个指标，必须力争实现。应在保证重点工程建设，特别是保证对今年和明年的生产有决定意义的重点工程建设的条件下，对设计、设备、建筑材料和施工力量进行全面的平衡和安排。既不应采取普遍削减或全面铺开的平均主义做法；也不能只强调某些有利条件，而不考虑设计施工和物资供应的全面平衡情况。因此，凡是物资供应和技术力量有保证的重点工程，应迅速开工建设；凡是物资供应和技术力量没有把握的或者把握不大的，应积极创造开工的条件，而不要盲目开工，造成被动；凡是根本没有条件的工程，应予削减。为了改变以往年度基本建设计划常常不能如数完成的状况，从今年开始已正式建立预备项目制度。预备建设项目经国务院批准之后，各部门即可在正式项目和预备项目之间，根据必要和可能，统一排队，互相调剂，分别轻重缓急进行建设；同时预留一部分建设项目，以便在设计施工和物资供应有保证的时候，立即进行施工。某些沿海城市的企业扩建改建，如投资少收效大者，亦可考虑列入今年的建设项目之内；另外有些建设单位如因等待图纸或钢筋水泥而发生窝工者，亦可先建一部分为职工生活服务的砖木结构房屋。在开工建设的单位中，领导的责任应引导群众提高工程质量和节约原材料，保证安全施工，争取按期投入生产，以达到迅速发挥投资效果的目的。
      （二）在工业生产方面，由于今年的工业生产任务，特别是重工业的生产任务十分繁重，因之领导的责任就在于把群众的劳动热情引向提高技术，提高质量，增加品种，贯彻工艺规程，加强协作配合，改善劳动组织，实行安全生产和克服薄弱环节等方面去。那些片面追求数量，而产品质量和品种规格不合需要的生产单位，应该领导群众提高技术，强化技术措施，加强新产品的试制和生产工作，提高产品质量和增加品种规格。所有产品必须经过严格检查，凡是不合规格的不准出厂；尚无质量标准的，有关机关应该迅速制定；对于设备和技术落后的企业要在可能范围内继续进行技术改造，使产品质量逐步做到有决定性的改进。对于某些机械产品的生产，由于今年原材料的供应比较紧张，必须根据设备能力、供销情况、技术力量和协作条件，在清查库存材料、核实材料的需要、降低消耗定额和保证产品质量、规格的条件下，做到供产销平衡。凡是暂时不需要扩大生产，而原材料供应紧张的产品，不能盲目增产，应该按照计划均衡地进行生产。凡与生产和基本建设没有决定影响而原材料供应不足的产品，应该根据具体情况，适当地限制生产。对于为生产和基本建设所亟需的原材料如生铁、钢材、水泥和木材等，必须领导群众努力挖掘潜在力量，在保证品种规格质量和交货时间的条件下，采取有效措施，积极增加生产。特别是钢材和水泥的生产，必须采取紧急措施，在国家原定计划的基础上，努力增产。各个企业都要注意解决在社会主义高潮中所出现的新的不平衡问题，组织各工序、各车间之间的均衡生产。对于同有关部门有协作关系的生产单位，应根据生产任务的需要，使协作关系与生产的发展相适应。原来中央与地方企业之间的协作关系，应该整顿和重新安排；公私合营后的机械工业，除担负必要的专业制造任务外，还应该重视和承担协作产品的制造与当地的修配任务。对于重大的协作问题，应由国家有关经济机关加以解决。所有协作任务，应分别纳入各单位的计划。
      （三）在物资供应方面，根据今年物资平衡的情况对于一切亟需的物资除了生产部门应努力增产，外贸部应努力争取多进口之外，各使用部门应大力推广先进经验，贯彻合理化建议，提高原材料的利用率；基建部门则应尽可能利用当地材料，以扩大物资来源。应查清库存，组织调剂，互相支援，充分发挥物资的潜力。今年各部门对钢材的使用，应完成在生产上节约
  4％和在基本建设上节约25％的要求。特别要注意反对虚报冒领和宽打窄用的现象，防止物资的浪费和积压，避免人为的紧张。同时，国家应建立重要物资的储备制度，以调节生产和供应之间的矛盾。不能将国家对重要物资的有计划的储备，看做是物资的积压。相反，这种储备对于我国经济有计划、按比例的发展和防范某些意外事件，是必要的物质保证。
      （四）要在发展生产的基础上，根据可能的条件，改善职工的物质文化生活。各个部门和企业都应努力做好职工的工资改革（特别是实行计件工资制）和评级工作，同时尽可能改善职工的住宅、食堂、医疗等福利设施。必须在生产发展、劳动生产率提高的基础上，逐步改善职工的生活。而职工生活的改善，又将进一步鼓舞群众的劳动热情和促进劳动生产率的提高。
      （五）最后，我还想讲一讲1957年计划的编订工作。1957年是我国第一个五年计划的最后一年，积极准备和安排1957年的计划，对于提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划所规定的任务，和为第二个五年计划做好必要的准备工作，是有重要意义的。1957年的计划，必须根据国民经济有计划按比例发展的法则，从全面平衡出发，把计划的主要指标制订得准确些和现实些。同时应争取计划草案提早下达，以利于经济和文化事业的合理安排。
      由于我们对计划工作经验不足，水平不高，所以在计划工作中存在很多缺点。但是随着国民经济的迅速发展和社会主义基本经济法则在我国国民经济中所起的作用的日益加强，又要求我们的计划工作水平必须大大提高一步，以便使国家的经济计划对整个国民经济活动发挥更大的指导作用，从而加速我国社会主义建设事业的进程。
