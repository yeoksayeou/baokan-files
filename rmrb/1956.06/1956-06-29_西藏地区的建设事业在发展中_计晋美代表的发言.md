I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget" made by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, the "Explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives" made by Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture, and the work report made by Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Our country's 1956 budget illustrates that the main source of budget revenue is the internal accumulation of the ever-growing socialist economy, and the main use of budget expenditure is to develop economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings. This precisely demonstrates that our people are engaged in peacefully building the motherland, and in the near future, will build our country into a completely modernized, prosperous, and great socialist nation. The Tibetan region, located in the strategic southwest border area of the motherland, has relatively backward economic and cultural life due to long-term transportation blockages. To enable Tibet's economy and culture to develop, it is necessary to have strong support from all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland in terms of material resources and technical personnel. From the part of the 1956 budget concerning Tibet, it can be seen that the economic construction, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in the Tibetan region will develop even more with the development of the motherland's construction.

Since the liberation of the Tibetan region, under the correct and wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and with the warm care and strong assistance from all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, especially the Han people, Tibet has achieved significant accomplishments and development in all aspects of its work. The unity among ethnic groups and within Tibet has been continuously strengthened, the national defense in the southwest of the motherland has been increasingly consolidated, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the Tibetan people has been constantly growing. In short, under the common goal of unity and progress, various construction undertakings in Tibet have greatly moved forward. For example, the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways, as well as the highways from Lhasa to various major cities in Tibet, have been opened to traffic. Trade companies, banks, post and telecommunications, agricultural experiment stations, and other institutions have been established in various places. Loans have been issued for agricultural, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and industrial and commercial purposes. Disaster relief has been provided for the water disasters in the Gyantse and Shigatse regions. Many people's hospitals and health clinics have been established, and many primary schools have been opened. In addition, some of the tasks stipulated in the "Decision on Assisting the Tibetan Region in Construction Matters" of the Seventh Meeting of the State Council have been completed, and some are in progress. In particular, the air route between the capital Beijing and Lhasa has recently been successfully test-flown. All of these have brought considerable benefits to the Tibetan people, and at the same time, have created favorable conditions for the official establishment of a unified Tibetan Autonomous Region.

In terms of cadre training: In recent years, in addition to sending a large number of young men and women to study at the Central and Southwest Nationalities Institutes, the Tibetan region has also organized studies for officials at all levels, and established the Lhasa Cadre School and the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Cadre Training Class. In particular, with the kind care of Chairman Mao and the active assistance of the Han elder brothers, the political consciousness of young men and women in the Tibetan region has been continuously improved through patriotic education, the appeal of the Party's ethnic policies, and the study of culture and science. They have gained a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies. The Young Pioneers organizations have been established in primary schools in major cities, and young people have also studied the basic knowledge of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. A large number of young people have honorably joined the New Democratic Youth League organization, and many outstanding young men and women have taken up work posts in building a new Tibet. In the future, we hope that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council will send us more cadres and give us greater help to establish and expand the organizations of the Party, the League, and the Pioneers so that Tibetan cadres can grow up under the close care and cultivation of the great Communist Party of China.

The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was officially established in Lhasa on April 22 this year. This is the common aspiration of the Tibetan people and all fraternal ethnic groups in the country. This aspiration has been realized under the glorious light of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies. It fully demonstrates the deep concern of our great motherland and Chairman Mao for us. Its establishment marks that the work in the Tibetan region has entered a new stage. In particular, on the occasion of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Central Committee and Chairman Mao sent a central delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi, which gave extremely important instructions and assistance to the progress and development of various tasks in Tibet, and conducted condolences in various parts of Tibet. This has greatly strengthened and developed the unity between Tibet and the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland, further enhanced the relationship between the central government and the Tibetan local government, and at the same time brought to all of us Tibetan people the confidence of victory in moving towards a socialist society. We are determined to follow the principle of "unity, progress, and greater development" instructed by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the basis of unity and unification, and to obey the resolutions and instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to complete all our work tasks. In the past few years, we have deeply realized the wisdom and correctness of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao in countless practical work experiences and facts. As long as we act according to the guidelines and policies instructed by the Central Committee, there is nothing that cannot be done well. It has also proved that only in this way can we realize the unified Tibetan Autonomous Region as soon as possible and benefit various construction undertakings in Tibet.

We deeply realize that with the socialist construction of the motherland and the increasing development of various construction undertakings in Tibet, the Tibetan ethnic group must get rid of the past backwardness, join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups, and transition to a prosperous and happy socialist society, it must undergo social reform. This is the necessary path for the Tibetan ethnic group to achieve progress and development. This truth has been proved by ironclad facts in various advanced fraternal ethnic regions in our country. We fully believe in the Central Committee's guidelines and principles of "peaceful, from top to bottom, only for the better, not for the worse" regarding reform in minority ethnic regions. We are determined and willing to do everything in our power to work towards the completion of this arduous task. This reform work has been supported by the two Grand Masters, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and by the vast majority of monks, officials, and people in Tibet. This winter and next spring, we will conduct reform pilot projects in some parts of Tibet, such as reducing and exempting debts and abolishing the Ula system, to gain experience, and then carry out comprehensive reform properly when conditions are ripe.

Now our motherland is rapidly building a socialist cause, and our future is infinitely bright and brilliant, just as Chairman Mao instructed, "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done."

We fully trust the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. The Tibetan people must move towards the bright road pointed out by the Communist Party. We are determined to unite and cooperate closely with all monks and lay people in Tibet under the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, under the direct leadership of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, the Tibet Military Region, and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, as well as the two Grand Masters, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, to strive for the early realization of a unified Tibetan Autonomous Region and to build a new Tibet in the motherland. We hope that our Tibetan ethnic group can transition together with all fraternal ethnic groups to a prosperous and happy socialist society.

    西藏地区的建设事业在发展中
    ——计晋美代表的发言
    关于本次大会国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念所作的“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”和农业部长廖鲁言所作的“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”，以及全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长兼秘书长彭真所作的工作报告，我表示完全同意和竭诚拥护。
    我国1956年预算说明了预算收入的主要来源，是日益增长的社会主义经济内部积累，预算支出的主要用途是发展经济建设和文化教育事业。这正可以说明我国人民正在从事和平建设祖国，而且在不久的将来将会把我国建设成为一个完全现代化的、富强的伟大的社会主义国家。西藏地方处于祖国西南国防要地，因长期交通阻塞，以致西藏的经济生活和文化生活比较落后。要使西藏的经济和文化能够得到发展，在物质资料和技术人才方面必须要有祖国各兄弟民族的大力支援，才能实现。在1956年预算中关于西藏的部分可以看出西藏地方的经济建设和文教卫生等项事业将随着祖国建设事业的发展而更加发展。
    西藏地方解放以来，在伟大的中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确英明领导下，在全国各兄弟民族，特别是汉族人民的热情关怀和大力帮助下，西藏在各方面的工作，都获得了显著的成就和发展。民族之间的团结和西藏内部的团结日益加强，祖国西南的国防日益巩固，西藏人民的爱国热情也正在不断地增长着。总之，在团结进步的同一目标下，西藏的各项建设事业，已大大地前进了一步。例如：修通了康藏青藏公路，以及由拉萨通往西藏各个主要城市的公路，各地设立了贸易公司、银行、邮电、农业试验场等机构，发放了农牧水利工商业贷款，救济了江孜、日喀则地区的水灾，设立了许多人民医院和卫生所，开办了许多小学校。另外国务院第七次会议“关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项的决定”中规定的工作，有的已经完成，有的正在进行中。特别是最近首都北京和拉萨的航线已试航成功。所有这些，都为西藏人民带来不少的福利，同时也就为统一的西藏自治区的正式成立创造了有利的条件。
    培养干部方面：几年来西藏地区除了选送大批的男女青年们到中央和西南民族学院学习外，并组织了各级官员学习，和开办了拉萨干部学校，及班禅堪布会议厅干部训练班。特别是西藏地区的青年和儿童，在毛主席的亲切关怀以及汉族老大哥的积极帮助下，由于爱国主义的教育和党的民族政策的感召和文化科学的学习，使西藏地区的男女青年的政治觉悟不断的得到了提高。对于毛主席的民族政策有了更深刻的认识。现在各主要城市的小学业已建立了中国少年先锋队的组织，青年们还学习了中国新民主主义青年团的基本知识，现已有大批的青年们，光荣地加入了新民主主义青年团的组织，并有不少优秀的男女青年走上了建设新西藏的工作岗位。今后我们更希望共产党中央、国务院派给我们更多的干部，给我们更大的帮助，建立和扩大党、团、队的组织。使西藏的干部能够在伟大的中国共产党的亲切的关怀和培养下成长起来。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会于今年4月22日在拉萨正式成立了。这是我们西藏人民和全国各兄弟民族的共同愿望。这个愿望在共产党毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下已经实现了。它充分显示了我们伟大祖国和毛主席对我们的深切关怀。它的成立，标志着西藏地区的工作进入了一个新的阶段。特别是当西藏自治区筹备委员会成立之际，中央和毛主席派来了以陈毅副总理为首的中央代表团，对西藏各项工作的前进和发展，给予了极为重要的指示和帮助，并在西藏各地进行了慰问。这就大大地加强和发展了西藏内部和祖国各兄弟民族之间的团结，进一步增进了中央与西藏地方的关系，同时给我们全体西藏人民带来了走向社会主义社会的胜利信心。我们坚决要在团结和统一的基础上遵循中央和毛主席指示的“团结进步更加发展”的方针，服从共产党中央和国务院的各项决议和指示，来完成我们一切的工作任务。几年来，我们在无数次的实际工作体验和事实当中，已深刻认识到中央和毛主席的英明和正确。只要我们根据中央指示的方针政策去做，就没有做不好的事情。同时也证明只有这样，才能够早日实现统一的西藏自治区和有利于西藏的各项建设事业。
    我们深刻认识到：随着祖国社会主义的建设以及西藏各项建设事业的日益发展，西藏民族要摆脱以往的落后状况，跻于先进民族的行列，过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，就必须要经过社会改革，这是西藏民族要取得进步和发展，所必须经过的途径。这个真理在我国各个先进兄弟民族地区，已经获得了铁一般事实的证明。我们完全确信，中央的“自上而下和平的、只能改好、不能改坏”的关于在少数民族地区的改革方针和原则。我们坚决地愿意尽我们一切力量，来为完成这一艰巨的任务而努力。这一改革工作已经得到达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼两位大师的赞助和西藏绝大部分僧俗官员群众的拥护。今冬明春，我们要在西藏部分地区进行改革，试办，如减免债务、废除乌拉制度，以便取得经验，然后在条件成熟时，妥善地普遍进行改革。
    现在我们祖国正在迅速的建设社会主义事业，我们的前途是无限灿烂光明的，正如毛主席所指示的“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。
    我们完全信赖中国共产党毛主席。西藏人民一定要向着共产党所指出的光明大道前进。我们坚决在中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛主席的英明正确领导下，在中共西藏工委、西藏军区和西藏自治区筹委会以及达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼两位大师的直接领导下，团结西藏全体僧俗人民亲密合作，为统一的西藏自治区早日实现，建设祖国的新西藏而奋斗。以期我们西藏民族能够和各兄弟民族共同过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
