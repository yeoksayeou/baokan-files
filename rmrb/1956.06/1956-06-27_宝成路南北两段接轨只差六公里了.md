(Our newspaper's dispatch from Huangsha River on the 26th) This evening, the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway had track laid to the joining point with the northern section - Huangsha River. The northern section's track laying had reached Nie Jiawan Station, which is six kilometers away from Huangsha River. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, under construction for four years and over 600 kilometers in length, will soon have its entire line connected.

When the workers of the nailing and bridge-building team of the Second Engineering Bureau of the southern section laid the last rail today, they accepted flowers and flags presented by local farmers and employee representatives amidst the sound of gongs and drums on the banks of the Jialing River.

In recent days, the northern and southern construction armies braved torrential rain and floods, overcame landslides and flowing sand, and completed the track-laying task ahead of schedule. Now, the track-laying workers in the southern section are eagerly looking forward to the early arrival of the track-laying workers from the northern section.

    宝成路南北两段接轨只差六公里了
    本报黄沙河26日电　今天傍晚，宝成铁路南段已铺轨到南北接轨点——黄沙河，北段已铺轨到聂家湾车站，距黄沙河还有六公里。兴修了四年、全长六百多公里的宝成铁路，不久便可全线接轨了。
    南段第二工程局钉道架桥队的工人们，今天铺下最后一根钢轨的时候，在嘉陵江畔锣鼓喧天声中，接受了当地农民和筑路员工代表的献花献旗。
    连日来，南北筑路大军冒着暴雨洪水，战胜了坍方流砂，提前完成了铺轨任务。现在，南段铺轨工人正热烈地盼望着北段铺轨工人早日来到。
