    Scenic Spots That Disappoint Tourists

    To the Editor:

    West Mountain, outside the West Gate of Echeng County, Hubei Province, is a famous scenic spot. On the mountain are Sun Quan, the King of Wu during the Three Kingdoms period’s summer palace, the Sword Testing Stone, and the Altar where he ascended the throne in the open air. Below the mountain is the vast Yangtze River, and opposite is the Red Cliff of Huangzhou (now Huanggang County). During the Song Dynasty, Su Dongpo often cruised and wandered here, and wrote "Record of the Nine-Bend Pavilion" and some poems in the Nine-Bend Pavilion (later renamed Huaipo Pavilion) on the mountain. West Mountain also has the tomb of Peng Chufan, a martyr of the Xinhai Revolution, the documents and supplies preserved by the people of the E (cheng) Da (ye) Yang (xin) border area during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, and cultural relics collected from various places during the land reform period.

    The people of Echeng County love West Mountain very much. Whenever they have free time, they come here in groups to see the historical sites, look at the rolling Yangtze River, taste a pot of tea, and eat the crispy "Dongpo Cakes" (snacks sold by monks; monks used to make cakes for Su Dongpo, so they were later called Dongpo Cakes in memory of Su Dongpo), feeling unspeakably happy. People call West Mountain "our park." The Echeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also plans to build "our park" in its planning.

    However, this spring, "our park" was occupied by the Huanggang Prefectural Commissioner's Office and used as the site of the "Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Training Class." The quiet Grand Hall of the Great Heroes became a classroom, Sun Quan's summer palace and other places became dormitories, the Huaipo Pavilion became a place for students to review their lessons, and the cultural relics exhibition hall became an office. The famous flowers such as peonies, herbaceous peonies, and roses planted in the flower beds were drenched with the students' washing water and soapy water for washing clothes, causing them to fall to one side. Beside the clear spring in the mountain stream, near the martyrs' tombs, and around the lush pines and cypresses, many manure buckets and urine jars were added. When tourists enter the mountain gate and see this scene, their desire to tour disappears, and they leave after wandering around the mountain gate for a while. Many people have repeatedly raised opinions to the County Party Committee and the People's Committee, requesting that the training class be moved away. The People's Committee reflected the opinions of the masses to the office of the Huanggang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, but no results were obtained.

    The Huanggang Prefectural Commissioner's Office is stationed in Huanggang County, so why did it cross the Yangtze River and run to West Mountain to run a training class? Is it that there are no suitable houses in Huanggang County? No, there are suitable houses, but they cost money to rent. Of course, it is not bad to save rent; but why doesn't the Huanggang Prefectural Commissioner's Office consider the interests of the vast number of tourists?

### 使游客扫兴的风景区

    使游客扫兴的风景区编辑同志：
    湖北省鄂城县西门外的西山是一个有名的风景区。山上有三国时代吴王孙权的避暑宫、试剑石和他露天即位的天坛。山下面是浩浩荡荡的长江，对面是黄州（即现在的黄冈县）赤壁。在宋代，苏东坡经常到这里泛舟遨游，曾在山中九曲亭里（后改为怀坡亭）作了“九曲亭记”和一些诗歌。西山还有辛亥革命烈士彭楚藩的坟墓，第一次国内革命战争时期鄂（城）大（冶）阳（新）边区人民保留的文件、用品，和土地改革时期从各地收集来的文物。
    鄂城县人民非常喜爱西山。每逢暇日，人们成群结队来到这里，看一看名胜古迹，望一望滚滚的长江，品一壶清茶，吃吃香脆的“东坡饼”（僧人卖的点心；从前僧人曾给苏东坡做饼吃，后来为了纪念苏东坡，所以就叫东坡饼），心里有说不出的愉快。人们把西山叫做“我们的公园”。中共鄂城县委员会在规划里也打算把“我们的公园”建设起来。
    但是，今年春季，“我们的公园”却被黄冈专署占去当作“血吸虫防治训练班”的校址了。清静的大雄宝殿作了课堂，孙权的避暑宫等作了宿舍，怀坡亭成了学员温习功课的地方，文物展览馆作了办公室。花池里栽种的牡丹、芍药、玫瑰等名贵花草，被学员的洗脸水、洗衣服的肥皂水等淋得东倒西歪。山涧清泉的旁边，烈士坟墓的附近，苍松翠柏的周围，添置了不少的粪桶、尿缸。游客们一进山门，看见这种情景，游兴一扫而空，在山门徘徊片刻就走了。很多人不断向县委和人民委员会提出意见，要求把训练班搬走。人民委员会把群众的意见反映给黄冈专署办公室，可是却没有得到什么结果。
    黄冈专署驻在黄冈县，为什么要越过长江奔上西山来办训练班呢？是不是黄冈县没有合适的房子呢？不，合适的房子是有的，不过要出租钱罢了。当然，节约房租不能说不好；但是黄冈专署为什么不考虑一下广大游客的利益呢？
