　　Fukuoka Communication

　　“Adding Affection to Affection”
　　By Our Correspondent Pei Da

　　In Tokyo, Japanese friends often use the saying "a distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor" to describe the close relationship between China and Japan. When you get to Fukuoka, local people say: "Close neighbors and across the street, adding affection to affection."

　　Fukuoka City is located at the western end of Japan and is the largest city in Kyushu. It is backed by the Tsukushi mountain range and embraces Hakata Bay. The crystal-clear Nakagawa River runs through the center, and the whole city is picturesque.

　　This place is closest to China and has had close ties since ancient times. As early as the Han Dynasty, Chinese tea was introduced here. Tang Dynasty silk fabrics and Chinese writing brushes were first introduced to Japan from here. To this day, "Hakata-ori" is still famous throughout the country. Eight hundred years ago, Shengfukuji Temple here received Chinese Buddhist envoys. Guo Moruo, a famous contemporary Chinese scholar and president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also lived here for more than four years.

　　In the long years of friendship, some unpleasant things have also happened here. The Mongol army of the Yuan Dynasty attacked this place, and Japanese militarists once used this place as one of the bases for invading China. However, these brief moments of unfriendliness have long passed, and what has replaced them is still deep friendship.

　　Since March of this year, Fukuoka Prefecture has launched the "China Dispatch Movement," deciding to send 20 people, including the mayor of Fukuoka City, the chairmen of the Fukuoka Prefectural and City Assemblies, and professors from Kyushu University, to China for a friendly visit. This movement has received the support of the prefectural and city assemblies. This spring, Fukuoka Prefecture sent one fishery representative to participate in the Japanese Fishery Delegation to China. Recently, the Prefectural Assembly has elected one member to participate in the National Local Assembly Representatives Delegation to China, and many people have voluntarily donated travel expenses.

　　Fukuoka's Hakata Bay began trading frequently with China during the Ming Dynasty and prospered as a result, once being known as one of Japan's three major ports. After the war, due to the impact of the American "embargo" policy, it seemed very desolate here. However, on May 3rd of this year, a cargo ship carrying 5,000 tons of ammonium sulfate sailed from here to China. Since then, maritime transport, which had been interrupted for ten years, has restarted. On this day, the citizens of Fukuoka went to the pier in groups like celebrating a happy event to see them off. Fukuoka City Mayor Konishi and City Council Chairman Takaoka specially entrusted the captain to take the gifts they gave to the mayor of Shanghai and others to China. According to local Japanese friends: In order to welcome the increasing development of Sino-Japanese trade, the Fukuoka City Council has decided to expand the central pier of Hakata Port on a large scale, with an estimated project cost of 2 billion yen, and a survey is currently underway.

　　Fishing has an ancient tradition in Fukuoka. According to the "Evolution of Fukuoka City," its western part was originally "a cold village with scattered fishermen's houses." After the war, fishery production here once declined, and only after the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement did the fish catch gradually increase. Now there are more than 500 fishing boats here, which often leave Hakata Bay to fish near the Zhoushan Islands. Whenever the fishing boats return fully loaded with colorful flags, the families of the fishermen gathered on the port shore cannot help but applaud and cheer. In the past year, more than 300 fishermen here have joined the Japan-China Friendship Association. Recently, some fishermen are rushing to build new fishing boats to welcome the arrival of the fishing season.

　　In early June, the people of Fukuoka received the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe headed by Mei Lanfang with infinite joy. The Governor of Fukuoka Prefecture and the Mayor, etc., personally came forward to welcome them, and major department stores hung huge banners welcoming the Peking Opera Troupe. After seeing the Peking Opera, people from all walks of life were even more overjoyed. An 84-year-old man, Tanaka Kumakichi, said:
　　"This place has an old friendship with China, but this is the first time to see Peking Opera. I never thought I could have such a good fortune today, thank you very much!" Kojima Yoichi, a famous "Hakata Doll" master, after watching "San Cha Kou," sculpted Li Shaochun's dance posture into a one-foot-high "doll" as a permanent souvenir of friendship.

　　Old friendship plus new affection, the hearts of the people of Fukuoka are linked even more closely with the hearts of the Chinese people. They are full of confidence and look forward to the rapid development of friendly relations. A 54-year-old ironworker said: "Seeing the beautiful Peking Opera, I thought of the Daye iron ore. I think the days of using Chinese iron ore again are not far away!" The manager of Fukuoka Fukukodo gave a large bunch of writing brushes to the Peking Opera delegation and expressed that he wanted to invite Chinese brush-making experts to Japan to exchange experiences.

　　The Chinese Peking Opera Troupe has left Fukuoka, but the words of Fukuoka friend Matsumoto Eiichi seem to be close by. He said: "I hope you will come again soon. At that time, you will no longer detour through Hong Kong, but come directly to Fukuoka from China. How happy that would be!"

### 亲上加亲

    “亲上加亲”
    本报记者　裴达
    在东京，日本友人常用“远亲不如近邻”这句话来形容中日两国的密切关系。到了福冈，当地人们则说：“近邻而又对门，亲上加亲”。
    福冈市位居日本西端，是九州最大的一个都市。它背倚筑紫连峰，怀抱博多湾，水晶般的那珂川横贯中央，全城景色绮丽如画。
    此地和中国最为接近，自古以来就有着亲密的连系。远在汉朝时代，中国的茶就传到这里。唐朝的绢织以及中国的毛笔，都首先从这里传到日本。至今，“博多唐织”仍然驰名全国。八百年前，这里的圣福寺接待过中国的佛教使者。当代中国著名学者、中国科学院院长郭沫若也在这里住过四年多。
    在长久的友好岁月里，这里也发生过不愉快的事情。元朝蒙古军袭击过此地，日本军国主义者也曾经把这里作为侵略中国的基地之一。但是，这暂短的不友好的时刻，早已成为过去，而代替它的仍然是深厚的友谊。
    今年三月以来，福冈县展开了“中国派遣运动”，决定要派遣福冈市市长，福冈县、市议会议长，九州大学教授等二十人到中国作友好访问。这个运动得到县、市议会的支持。今年春天，福冈县派出渔业代表一人，参加了日本渔业访华团。最近，县议会又推选出议员一名，准备参加全国地方议会代表访华团，并且有许多人自动捐献路费。
    福冈博多湾从明朝开始就和中国进行频繁的贸易，并因此而兴盛起来，曾被称为日本三大港口之一。战后，由于美国“禁运”政策的影响，这里显得十分凄凉。但是，在今年五月三日，一艘装载五千吨硫安的货船，从这里出港开往中国。从此，中断十年的海运又重新开始了。这一天，福冈市民像办喜事一样成群结队地前往码头送行。福冈市市长小西、市议会议长高丘特意委托船长，把他们赠给上海市长等的礼品带到中国去。据当地日本友人谈：福冈市议会为迎接中日贸易的日益发展，已经决定大规模地扩建博多港的中央码头，预计工程费为二十亿日元，目前正在进行勘察。
    渔业在福冈有着古老的传统。据“福冈市沿革”记载，它的西部原是“渔家点点一寒村”。战后此地渔业曾一度减产，自从中日渔业协定实行后，鱼的收获量才逐渐增加。现在这里有五百多只渔船，经常从博多湾出港去舟山群岛附近捕鱼。每当渔船挂满各色旗帜满载而归的时候，群集在港岸上的渔民家属，都情不自禁地鼓掌欢呼。一年来，此地渔民参加日中友好协会的，已达三百多人。最近，有些渔民正在赶造新的渔船，准备迎接捕鱼旺季的到来。
    六月上旬，福冈人民以无限喜悦的心情接待了以梅兰芳为首的中国京剧代表团。福冈县县知事和市长等亲自出面欢迎，各大百货店都挂起欢迎京剧团的巨幅标语。各界人士观赏了京剧之后，更是喜出望外。一位八十四岁的老人田中熊吉说：
  “此地和中国有老交情，可是看京剧这是第一次。想不到我今天能有这样的好眼福，万分感谢！”“博多人形”名匠小岛与一师看了“三岔口”之后，把李少春的舞蹈姿势塑制成一尺高的“人形”，作为永久友好的纪念。
    旧交加新情，福冈人们的心和中国人的心连结得更加紧密了。他们满怀信心地期待着友好关系的迅速发展。一位五十四岁的炼铁工人说：“看到了优美的京剧，就想起了大冶铁矿石。我想再用中国铁矿石的日子一定不远了！”福冈复古堂经理把一大束毛笔送给了京剧代表团，并且表示要邀请中国制笔专家来日本交流经验。
    中国京剧代表团已经远离福冈，福冈友人松本英一的话却似近在身边。他说：“希望你们不久再来。那时，你们一定不再绕道香港，而是由中国直接来到福冈。那该多么高兴啊！”
