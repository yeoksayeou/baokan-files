    Strive to Fulfill the Task of Socialist Transformation
    ——Speech by Representative Xiong Yingdong
    I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports by Vice Premier Li, Minister Liao, Vice Chairman Peng, and the speeches by the central leaders.
    I am a private representative from the Xi'an Public-Private Joint Venture Dahua Textile Factory. Now I would like to express some opinions about our public-private joint venture.
    It has only been a little over two years since the Xi'an Dahua Textile Factory became a public-private joint venture in 1954, and it has already undergone tremendous changes. First of all, the workers have truly become the masters of the enterprise, and their production enthusiasm and socialist labor zeal have been greatly improved. This has effectively increased production and has also led to many improvements in the originally unreasonable aspects of the enterprise. Now, our factory is very different from the backward state of the capitalist management era, whether in terms of production quantity, production quality, production costs, or labor productivity. Taking this year's situation as an example, the annual output value will increase by 20% compared with before the joint venture; the unit cost of 12-pound cotton cloth has been reduced by 37.5% compared with before the joint venture; labor productivity has been increased by 49% compared with before the joint venture; the ability of fine yarn workers to manage spindles has now increased from an average of 400 spindles before the joint venture to 900 spindles, and some have even reached 1,160 spindles; the rate of first-class cloth reached more than 98% last year (87.06% before the joint venture). After the implementation of the new quality standards this year, the rate of superior products has reached 87%, and the rate of standard cotton yarn is 85%; this year's products will be reduced by 22.17% based on the processing unit before the joint venture, while the annual profit will still increase by 16.88% compared with before the joint venture. With the continuous improvement of production, the welfare of employees has increased year by year, and shareholders' dividends have also been received annually. All of the above situations are sufficient to show that private enterprises will show great superiority by becoming public-private joint ventures and gradually becoming socialist, and it is also sufficient to show that only by taking the socialist road can private enterprises and capitalists have a bright and beautiful future.
    Now we deeply feel the benefits of private enterprises taking the socialist road, especially after hearing Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech at this conference, I was very excited. Hearing Vice Premier Chen say in his speech that the fixed interest rate of our enterprise has not only been raised from the three percent we suggested to five percent, but also that private personnel with less capital can enjoy the same treatment as ordinary employees, how can this not be exciting! Recalling when we first formed the joint venture, although we verbally shouted that we were willing to form a public-private joint venture, we had many concerns in our minds. We were afraid that the valuation would be too low, that we would have positions without power, that we were worried about whether we could get along with the public representatives, whether dividends could be paid as usual, whether our future lives would be guaranteed, and what our personal future would be like? There were endless doubts. Although these many concerns have been shattered by the facts, it is really naive and ridiculous to think about it. Although those concerns no longer exist, from our own point of view, it is not that there are no problems at all. We are satisfied with the status quo, often comparing ourselves with the past backward state, not with the advanced; we have not completely changed our capitalist views, often emphasizing quantity over quality, and also love to argue about processing profits; our capitalist style in business management is also more serious, willing to strengthen workers' labor intensity, but not paying much attention to workers' safety and health. Furthermore, from the enterprise itself, many characteristics and shortcomings brought about by the capitalist management period have not been completely changed and overcome. For example, old machines, inconsistent equipment specifications and standards, narrow workshops, and complex technical requirements all need to be improved and updated. If the above-mentioned many problems from people to enterprises are not thoroughly resolved, it will be difficult to guarantee that capitalist enterprises will be completely transformed into socialist enterprises. Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: The socialist revolution will be basically completed nationwide in about 3 years. Now that one year is about to pass, with only two years left, our tasks in transformation are still very serious. The question now is how do we strive to complete the task of socialist transformation in the short two years ahead? The question is placed like this, isn't it clear enough?
    Now I would like to propose that we work hard in the following aspects to complete the task of socialist transformation within a time limit. Please correct me if it is not appropriate.
    1. Strengthen self-education, strive to improve socialist awareness and political and ideological level, and thoroughly overcome bourgeois ideology. In order to complete the task of self-transformation, we must strengthen the study of political theory. Through the study of political theory, we must further understand the inevitable laws of social development, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois truth that the capitalist world is "eternal", and further understand the consistency and interdependence between personal future and national future, seriously criticize various bourgeois ideas, and resolutely overcome the capitalist profit viewpoint and business management style. We must also go deep among the workers, learn from the workers, learn from their spirit of hard work and endurance, learn from their excellent qualities, and learn from their position and viewpoints. Furthermore, we must make full use of the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, boldly expose our shortcomings, humbly listen to the opinions of workers, and especially learn from the work style and socialist management methods of public representatives. If you have any opinions, speak in person, do not express dissatisfaction behind your back. Only by strengthening self-transformation can we improve our enterprise management level, further do a good job in enterprise leadership, and lead employees well in production. Now I have set a learning plan for self-transformation, and I must implement it seriously.
    2. Give full play to the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses of workers, and rely on them to complete the socialist transformation of enterprises. Facts have fully proven that only by relying on the workers and giving full play to their wisdom and enthusiasm can the task of socialist transformation of enterprises be completed. Since liberation, the workers' inventions and rationalization proposals have had a great effect on enterprise improvement. In the future, we must further support the workers' socialist competition, correctly treat the workers' rationalization proposals, and pay special attention to promoting and cultivating worker cadres. In recent years, we have made achievements in training and promoting worker cadres. For example, we have now trained and promoted 560 cadres and technicians from the workers. In addition to 375 being transferred to agencies and brother factories, the rest have stayed in the factory to work: now 61% of the cadres in our factory, 49 out of 63 section chiefs and workshop directors, have been trained and promoted from workers. After these cadres were promoted, they greatly promoted the work. For example, in the past, the monthly cost could not be completed in half a year, but now it can be compiled before the 7th of the following month. However, there are still problems in our training and promotion of worker cadres, which should be resolved quickly. In addition, although our distrust of workers' thinking has now been overcome, it should still be paid attention to in the future.
    3. Care for the lives of employees, pay attention to employee welfare, and improve employee production enthusiasm. Facts have educated us that it is wrong not to care about the lives and welfare of employees. As long as we care about the lives and welfare of employees, it will improve their enthusiasm for production, which is absolutely beneficial to production and enterprise transformation. Since liberation, although we have paid attention to the lives of employees and added a lot of welfare facilities, it is still not enough. This is mainly inseparable from our capitalist management thinking. During this time of opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, employees have raised many opinions to us in this regard, which have attracted our attention.
    4. Improve enterprise management level, improve technology, and complete the socialist transformation of enterprises. We have done a lot of work in this area, but it is still fragmented. In the future, we must make a comprehensive plan to gradually improve and update various technical equipment. Please give strong support to the national leading agencies. We must also learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improve technology.
    5. Strengthen unity to ensure the completion of the task of socialist transformation. Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out in his speech: "It is necessary to make the capitalists take a positive attitude to cooperate with the public representatives and strengthen unity with the worker masses." This instruction of Vice Premier Chen is extremely important. In order to do a good job in production and complete the task of transforming people and enterprises, we have no reason not to cooperate with the public representatives and no reason not to unite with the employees. To strengthen unity, first of all, we must have an overall concept and obey the interests of the country and the people. All problems should be considered from this basic principle. We must respect and obey the leadership of the public. The so-called obedience to the leadership of the public, I think, does not mean that everything, big or small, must be asked for instructions. For routine matters, you should take responsibility according to the principles and regulations, and do not shirk responsibility; for major issues of the entire factory, you should negotiate and solve them well with the public leadership, and you must not act arbitrarily. Otherwise, it will hinder unity. Special attention should also be paid to the unity of employees. Do whatever is conducive to unity, otherwise never act rashly.
    Representatives, I want to work hard from the above five aspects to complete the transformation task. As long as there is the leadership of the Communist Party and the active help of the vast number of employees, I believe that our transformation task will be successfully completed.

    努力完成社会主义改造任务
    ——熊应栋代表的发言
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李副总理、廖部长、彭副委员长的报告和中央各领导同志的发言。
    我是西安公私合营大华纺织厂的私方代表，现在我想就我们这个公私合营企业发表一些意见。
    西安大华纺织厂由1954年公私合营到现在仅两年多的时间，已经起了极大的变化。首先是工人群众真正成了企业的主人，他们的生产积极性和社会主义的劳动热情大大提高了。从而有效地提高了生产，并且积极地对于原来企业不合理的地方也作了很多改进。现在我们这个厂子，不论是生产数量、生产质量、生产成本或劳动生产率等都与资本主义经营时代的落后状态大不相同了。就拿今年的情况来说，全年产值将比合营前增长20％；12磅棉布的单位成本已比合营前降低37.5％；劳动生产率已比合营前提高49％，细纱工人的看锭能力现在平均已由合营前的400锭增至900锭，有的已高达1，160锭；棉布的正布率去年已达98％以上（合营前为87.06％）。今年新质量标准实行后，上等品率已达87％，棉纱标准品率为85％；今年的产品按合营前的工缴单位计算将降低22.17％，而全年利润较合营前仍将增长16.88％。随着生产的不断提高，职工的福利逐年有所增长，股东红利也按年拿到。所有以上这些情况足以说明私营企业以公私合营并逐步社会主义化就会显示出极大的优越性，也足以说明只有走社会主义的道路，私营企业和资方人员才会有光明美好的前途。
    现在我们已深深感到私营企业走社会主义道路的好处，特别是这次大会听到陈云副总理的发言后使我非常兴奋。听陈副总理在发言中讲，我们企业的定息不仅已由我们建议的三厘提高到五厘，而资金不多的私方人员还可以与一般的职工享受同样的待遇，这怎能叫人不兴奋呢！回忆刚合营时，我们嘴里虽喊愿意公私合营，谁知思想上却有不少的顾虑，既怕估价偏低，又怕有职无权，还担心能否和公方代表相处，股息能否照发，将来生活有无保障，个人出路又怎么样？种种疑虑不一而足。虽然这许多顾虑都被事实粉碎了，但想起来实在幼稚可笑。现在那些顾虑虽然不存在了，但从我们本身来说并不是毫无问题了。我们满足现状，往往和过去落后状态比，不和先进的比；我们还没有完全改变资本主义的观点，往往重量而不重质，同时也爱争工缴利润；我们在经营管理上的资本主义作风也较严重，愿意加强工人劳动强度，却不大注意工人的安全卫生。再从企业本身来说，资本主义经营时期带来的许多特点和缺点还没有完全改变和克服。如机器陈旧，设备规格标准不一，厂坊窄狭，技术要求复杂等都待改进更新。上述由人到企业的这许多问题如果不彻底解决，就很难保证使资本主义的企业完全变为社会主义的企业。毛主席明确指出：大约要在3年之内，社会主义革命就在全国范围基本完成。现在一年将快过去，仅有两年的时间，我们在改造方面的任务还很严重。现在的问题是在今后短短的两年中，我们如何来努力完成社会主义的改造任务。问题就这样摆着，难道还不明确吗？
    现在我想提出，从以下几方面努力，限期完成社会主义的改造任务。是否妥当请各位代表指正。
    一、加强自我教育，努力提高社会主义觉悟和政治思想水平，彻底克服资产阶级思想。为了完成自我改造任务，必须加强政治理论学习。通过政治理论学习进一步认识社会发展的必然规律，彻底批判资产阶级认为资本主义世界“永恒”的真理，并要进一步认识个人前途与国家前途的一致性和依存关系，认真批判资产阶级的各种思想，坚决克服资本主义的利润观点和经营管理作风。还要深入工人当中，向工人学习，学习他们的吃苦耐劳的精神，学习他们的优良品质，学习他们的立场和观点。更要充分运用批评与自我批评的武器，要大胆暴露自己的缺点，虚心倾听工人的意见，尤其要学习公方代表的工作作风和社会主义管理方法。如有意见，要讲在当面，不要背后表示不满。只有加强自我改造，才能提高我们的企业管理水平，才能进一步做好企业领导工作，才能很好领导职工进行生产。现在我已订下自我改造的学习计划，一定要认真执行。
    二、充分发挥工人群众的智慧和积极性，依靠他们来完成企业的社会主义改造任务。事实已经充分证明，只有依靠工人、充分发挥他们的智慧和积极性，就可以完成企业的社会主义改造任务。解放以来工人的创造发明和合理化建议对于企业改进已经有很大的成效，今后我们要进一步支持工人的社会主义竞赛，正确对待工人的合理化建议，特别要注意提拔培养工人干部。几年来我们在培养提拔工人干部方面已经做出成绩，如现在我们从工人中培养提拔的干部和技术人员已有560名，除375名输送给机关和兄弟厂外，其余都留厂工作：现在我厂已有61％的工人干部，63名科长、车间主任级干部中的49名，是从工人中培养提拔起来的。这些干部被提拔起来后，对工作有很大的推动作用。如过去每月的成本半年还赶不出来，现在次月7日以前就可编好。但是我们在培养提拔工人干部方面还有问题存在，应当迅速解决。另外我们不相信工人的思想现在虽已克服了，但今后仍应引起注意。
    三、关心职工生活，注意职工福利，提高职工生产积极性。事实已经教育了我们，不关心职工生活和福利是错误的。只要我们关心职工的生活福利，就会提高他们生产的积极性，这样对于生产和企业改造绝对是有利的。解放以来，我们虽然注意了职工生活，也添了不少的福利设施，但还是不够的。这主要是和我们的资本主义经营思想分不开的。这次在反对右倾保守思想时，职工在这方面对我们提出了不少的意见，已经引起了我们的注意。
    四、提高企业管理水平，改进技术，完成对企业的社会主义改造任务。在这方面我们已进行了不少的工作，但还是零碎的，今后我们要作出一个全面规划，要对各项技术设备，逐步改进更新，请国家领导机关大力支持，我们还要学习苏联先进经验，改进技术。
    五、加强团结，保证完成社会主义改造任务。陈云副总理在发言中指出：“必须使资方人员采取积极态度同公股代表进行合作，同职工群众加强团结。”陈副总理的这一指示极其重要。为了搞好生产和完成人和企业的改造任务，我们没有理由不与公方代表合作，没有理由不和职工团结。要加强团结，首先我们必须要有一个整体观念，要服从国家和人民的利益。无论什么问题都应该从这个基本原则来考虑。必须尊重和服从公方领导。所谓服从公方领导，我认为并不是事无大小的都要请示，属于经常性的事情，自己就应该按照原则规定负起责来去办，不要推卸责任；属于全厂重大问题就应该很好和公方领导协商解决，不能独断独行。否则就会妨害团结。对于职工的团结也要特别注意，凡是有利于团结的事就办，否则绝不轻举妄为。
    各位代表：我想从上述五方面努力完成改造任务。只要有共产党的领导，有广大职工的积极帮助，我相信我们的改造任务一定能够胜利完成。
