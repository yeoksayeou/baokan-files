To Develop China's Science and Technology to the World's Advanced Level
— Speech by Representative Qin Renchang

Having listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," I realized that all aspects of national construction have achieved brilliant results, and I feel very satisfied. As a member of China's scientific community, I am also excited that the national budget for scientific undertakings in 1956 will more than double compared to the previous year. This vividly illustrates how much the Party and the government value the development of science.

For the past few months, along with scientists from across the country, I have had the honor of participating in the work of drafting China's long-range plan for the development of science and technology under the leadership of the State Council, which is now entering its final stage. This historically significant scientific plan, as pointed out by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in his speech, will be the charter for our country's scientific research in the next twelve years. During these months of work, I received another profound education and had many thoughts, which I would like to briefly share now.

In the old society, I worked in science for more than twenty years. Looking back today, it was entirely spontaneous, "science for the sake of science," with little connection to reality and even less concern for politics. The reactionary rulers did not value science at all, and scientists were unwilling to get involved in politics. Science and politics were completely opposed. Scientists in old China had a strong sense of inferiority.

In the early days of liberation, due to a lack of understanding of the policies of the Party and the government, I was also skeptical about the future of science in the new China, and sometimes I felt bewildered. It was not until I studied the Party's general line and general task for the transition period that I began to understand (but still very little) that socialist construction, in addition to relying on the creative labor of the working class and the broad masses of peasants, also required the cooperation of science and technology. But I still had a unclear understanding of what kind of science and technology should be developed and how to develop it. In September 1954, at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, I heard Chairman Mao point out in his opening speech that we should strive to change China's backwardness in economy and science and culture in a few decades and rapidly reach the world's advanced level. After this instruction, my understanding was further improved, especially after Premier Zhou's speech on the issue of intellectuals. I examined and realized that my past ideas about the Party and the government's scientific issues were completely wrong and unfounded. Facts speak louder than words. In order to develop China's science and technology, the state invited a group of scientists from across the country this spring to spend nearly half a year, with the assistance of top Soviet scientists, to formulate a long-term plan for national scientific development and an action plan for the next two years. This unprecedented fact is the most vivid illustration of the Party and the government's great attention to science and technology. Not only Chinese scientists but even the Soviet scholars who participated in guiding the plan felt that the new China's plan for the development of scientific undertakings was very ambitious. Recently, the report by Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" for literary and scientific work, further illustrates that the "golden age" of science is about to arrive in China. I, along with other Chinese scientists, feel honored and excited to be born in today's new China.

The formulation of the Twelve-Year National Plan for the Development of Science and Technology is the cornerstone for the development of science in our country. It points out the general direction for our country to advance towards all sciences, especially the most important ones, in the future. To smoothly implement this great scientific plan, further efforts from all sides are naturally required. There is no doubt that the Party and the government will give strong support to promote its early realization. There is also no doubt that scientists across the country will be willing to contribute all their strength to complete this glorious task. However, scientific work is not enough with enthusiasm alone. Under the current conditions, a greedy and rash approach will not be beneficial. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government and with the cooperation of fraternal countries, especially Soviet scientists, we must move forward actively and steadily, and we must first do a good job of deployment. For this purpose, combined with some insights from the speeches of Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, I would like to talk about my personal views, and I ask all representatives to correct me.

1.  We should vigorously select outstanding intermediate-level scientific cadres and university graduates as training targets. On the basis of strengthening their study of basic scientific theories, they should be trained to become specialists under the guidance of domestic and foreign mentors. It is inappropriate to specialize too early without mastering basic scientific theories. However, it is precisely on this issue that many young students in our country, especially today's university graduates, still cannot understand. They always want to "make a splash" quickly and think that studying basic theory is too slow and not as fast as doing technology. Of course, technology is what the country needs most at present and should be studied, but they have not fully realized that technology, if not based on a broad and deep theoretical foundation, is difficult to improve. At the same time, we should also try our best to attract students studying abroad to return to China, because this is the most realistic way to expand our scientific team.

2.  It is suggested that teachers should be appropriately adjusted in national comprehensive universities and other institutions of higher learning as much as possible, to first run well the majors and specializations; and to enrich the existing research institutions of the Academy of Sciences and the research institutions of industrial departments. At present, the professional teachers in many universities in our country are too scattered, and it seems that they should be appropriately concentrated to strengthen teaching and scientific research forces, and further improve the scientific level of university graduates. The scientific strength of the existing research institutes of the Academy of Sciences is also quite weak, and it should also be appropriately concentrated. Under these circumstances, if many new research institutions are established immediately, the result will be that they will all become empty shells, and everyone will not be able to get started. The result will delay the rapid development of our country's scientific undertakings. This is a serious mistake. I think that the way to make China's science and technology approach the world's advanced level within twelve years should not be completely dependent on the size of the number of research institutions, but mainly on the improvement of the scientific level of cadres. If it is thought that adding a few more research institutions or institutions of higher learning with empty content is equivalent to catching up with the international advanced scientific level, then it would be too easy. The establishment of new institutions must also guarantee the quality of work. Of course, in order to develop some of the most important scientific growth points, it is still completely necessary to establish new institutions.

3.  Enriching books, instruments, and equipment and ensuring working hours are two basic conditions for carrying out scientific research. Without these, it is difficult for any scientist to work. In recent years, the higher education department has been busy with teaching reform and has achieved great results, but it has not paid enough attention to enriching the scientific books of universities, especially the old journals. Some leaders of universities only value textbooks and think that adding domestic and foreign scientific journals and monographs is also a waste, which affects the enthusiasm of teachers for scientific research. In recent years, scientists generally do not get guaranteed working hours, and the more reputable scientists are, the more social activities they have. The reason is very clear. If a worker in a factory workshop cannot regularly participate in production, can he still be considered an advanced worker after two or three years? I think not. In today's rapid development of science, it is obviously difficult for scientists to catch up with the international scientific level if they cannot go to the laboratory for research for a long time. Premier Zhou has given instructions on the issue of ensuring research working hours, which scientists are satisfied with.

In short, in order to develop China's science and technology to the world's advanced level within twelve years, we must closely unite around the Party and the government, give full play to creative labor, and work hard with a hundredfold confidence to complete this glorious and arduous task.

Finally, I fully agree with Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress" and suggest that the Congress approve them.

    使我国科学技术发展到世界先进水平
    ——秦仁昌代表的发言
    我听了李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，认识了国家建设的各个方面都取得了辉煌的成绩，感到十分满意。作为我国科学队伍里的一员，我还感到兴奋的是，1956年内国家预算对科学事业的支出比上年增加一倍以上，这生动地说明了党和政府是如何重视科学事业的发展的。
    几个月来，和全国科学家一道，我很光荣地参加了在国务院领导下的我国发展科学技术远景规划工作，现在已进入结束阶段。这个有历史意义的科学规划，诚如中国科学院郭沫若院长在他的发言中指出的，将是我国今后十二年内科学研究的宪章。在这几个月的工作中，我又受了一次深刻的教育，也有许多感想，现在要简单地说一说。
    我在旧社会里，做过二十多年的科学工作。今日看来，那完全是自发的，“为科学而科学”的，很少联系实际，更不问政治。反动统治丝毫不重视科学，科学家也不愿过问政治，科学与政治是完全对立的。旧中国的科学家有着强烈的自卑感的。
    在解放初期，由于不了解党和政府的政策，我对科学在新中国的发展前途也是怀疑的，有时还感到彷徨。一直等到学习了党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，我才开始知道（但还是很少）社会主义建设除了依靠工人阶级和广大农民的创造性的劳动外，还要科学技术的配合，但到底要搞什么样的科学技术，怎样搞法，我仍然认识不清。1954年9月，在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，我听了毛主席在开幕词里指出要在几十年内，努力改变我国经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界的先进水平这段指示后，我的认识又提高了一步，特别是在周总理关于知识分子问题的讲话之后，我检查了并且认识了我过去对党和政府关于科学问题的想法是完全错误的，毫无根据的。事实胜于雄辩。国家为要发展我国科学技术，曾于今春邀集了全国一批科学家，以将近半年的时间，在苏联第一流科学家们的协助下，进行了制订国家发展科学的长远规划和今后两年的行动计划，这一史无前例的事实就是党和政府十分重视科学技术的最生动的一个说明。不但中国科学家们而且连参加指导规划的苏联学者们都感到新中国的这个科学事业发展的规划是很远大的。最近中共中央宣传部陆定一部长关于
  “百花齐放，百家争鸣”的文艺和科学工作的方针的报告，更说明了科学在中国的
  “黄金时代”将要到来。我和中国其他科学家们都以生在今日的新中国而感到光荣和兴奋。
    十二年国家发展科学技术规划的制订是发展我国科学的奠基石。它指出了我国今后向各门科学，特别是最重要的科学大进军的总方向。要顺利地贯彻这个伟大的科学规划，自然还有待于各方面进一步的努力。毫无疑问，党和政府一定会给以大力支持，来促使它的早日实现。也毫无疑问，全国科学家们一定愿意贡献自己的一切力量来完成这个光荣的任务。但科学工作光凭热情还是不够的，在目前条件下，贪多冒进的做法也是不会有好处的。我们要在党和政府的正确领导下和兄弟国家特别是苏联科学家们的合作下，积极而稳步的前进，特别要先做好部署工作。为此目的，结合对中国科学院郭沫若院长和高等教育部杨秀峰部长的两个发言的一些体会，我要讲一讲我个人的看法，请各位代表指正。
    1．应该大力选拔优秀的中级科学干部和高等学校毕业生作为培养对象。在加强他们的科学基本理论学习的基础上，在国内外导师的指导下培养成为专才。没有掌握科学基本理论而过早的专门化是不恰当的。但正是在这个问题上，我国许多青年学生特别是今日高等学校毕业生还是想不通的。他们总想很快的“一鸣惊人”，对学习基本理论认为太纡缓，不如搞技术来得快。技术当然是国家目前最需要的，应该学习，他们却没有完全认识到技术，如果不是建立在广泛深厚的理论基础上，是很难提高的。同时，我们还要尽可能地争取留学生回国，因为这是扩大我国科学队伍的最现实的办法。
    2．建议尽可能地在全国综合大学和其他高等学校内适当地调整教师，先办好专业及专门化；充实科学院现有的研究机构和产业部门的研究机构。目前我国许多高等学校的专业师资太分散，似乎应该适当地集中，加强教学与科学研究力量，进一步提高高等学校毕业生的科学水平。科学院现有研究所的科学力量也相当薄弱，也应当适当地集中。在这种情况下，如马上成立许多新的研究机构，其结果会都变成空架子，大家搞不起来，其结果将会推迟我国科学事业的迅速发展，这是个严重错误。我想要使我国科学技术十二年内接近世界先进水平的做法，不该是完全在于研究机构的数量有多大，而该是主要地在于干部的科学水平的提高吧，如果认为多增设几个内容空虚的研究机构或是高等学校，就算赶上了国际先进科学水平，那就未免太容易了。增设机构同时要保证工作质量。当然，为了发展一些最重要的科学生长点，设立新机构还是完全必要的。
    3．充实图书仪器设备和切实保证工作时间是开展科学研究的两个基本条件。没有这些，任何一个科学家是很难进行工作的。几年来，高教部门忙于教学改革，取得了很大成绩，但对充实高等学校的科学图书，特别是老的期刊方面，还重视不够。有些高等学校的领导只重视教课书，对于国内外科学杂志和专著的添购认为也是浪费，影响了教师们对科学研究的积极性。几年来，科学家一般地得不到保证工作的时间，而且愈是有点声誉的科学家，社会活动也愈多。道理很清楚，一个工厂车间的工人，如果不能经常参加生产，经过两年三载以后，还能算个先进工人吗？我想是不能的。在科学突飞猛进的今日，科学家很长时期不能到实验室进行研究，要想赶上国际科学水平，显然也是困难的。对于保证研究工作时间这个问题，周总理已作了指示，科学家感到满意。
    总之，为要使我国科学技术十二年内发展到世界先进水平，我们一定要紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，发挥创造性的劳动，以百倍信心，为完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务而努力。
    最后，我完全同意廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”，彭真副委员长关于“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”，并建议大会批准。
