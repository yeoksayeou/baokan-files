To the Editor:

    The letter from Comrade Tan Qitai on the "Readers' Letters" page on May 13th regarding "Travelers to Beijing Unable to Find Accommodation" does indeed reflect a problem worthy of attention. According to our understanding, only a few hotels in Beijing have poor business due to their remote locations; other hotels are full every day. Approximately two hundred travelers in Beijing are gathering in the waiting rooms of train stations every day because they cannot find a hotel. One day in March, twenty-five out-of-town commissioners, county heads, civil affairs bureau chiefs, and other staff, as well as eighty university students from Shanghai (including thirty female students), stayed on the communal heated platform bed in Wang Qingshun Store in Chongwen District. In addition, there have been incidents of staff members on official business in Beijing having their documents stolen while staying on communal heated platform beds. It must be said that this situation is very serious.

    Recently, the Beijing First Social Welfare Company held a business meeting of the hotel management offices of various districts to study this issue, and decided to add beds in larger hotels, provided that it does not affect the health of the guests. This will solve the accommodation problem for approximately five hundred travelers in the four districts of Qianmen, Chongwen, Xidan, and Xuanwu, greatly reducing the phenomenon of travelers to Beijing not being able to find a hotel. To make it easier for guests to find hotels quickly, each district also has a liaison group to keep track of the vacancy situation of each hotel.

    However, the above measures cannot fundamentally solve the problem of insufficient hotels in Beijing. Beijing does not have a small number of hotels; the main reason for the current situation of supply falling short of demand, apart from some problems with the geographical distribution of hotels, is mainly due to the fact that many hotels are leased long-term by government agencies and military units. According to a survey in March of this year, the total number of hotels leased long-term was 123 (accounting for approximately 24% of the total number of hotels in the city), and the total number of rooms leased long-term was 2,241 (accounting for 30% of the total number of guest rooms). Some of the leased rooms have very low utilization rates, only 40% to 60%. The total annual rent paid by various units for leasing hotels amounts to 847,500 yuan, a quite staggering figure. For example, the total assets of Linchun Hotel, which is leased by a certain unit, were 3,819 yuan during the recent inventory of assets, while the annual rental income was 16,060 yuan, accounting for 436% of the total assets. If the rent paid by the state in one year were used to build houses, at a cost of sixty yuan per square meter, more than nine hundred rooms of fifteen square meters could be built. Obviously, this practice of long-term hotel leasing is a losing proposition.

    In order to solve this problem, we have consulted with some agencies that lease hotels, requesting them to terminate the leases; however, they all said that the housing problem cannot be solved and are unwilling to terminate the leases. We hope that the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Housing Management and the housing management units of various military and government agencies will promptly study and rationally solve this problem.

### 希望改变长期包租旅馆的办法

    希望改变长期包租旅馆的办法编辑同志：
    五月十三日“读者来信专页”上谈启诒同志关于“到北京来的旅客找不到住处”的来信，的确反映了一个值得重视的问题。据我们了解：北京市只有个别旅店因为地区偏僻营业较差，其他旅店每天都客满。每天在北京约有二百个旅客因为找不到旅店而聚集在车站候车室里。三月份有一天，在崇文区王庆顺店的通铺大炕上住了二十五位外地来的专员、县长、民政局长等工作人员和从上海来的八十名大学生（其中有女生三十名）。此外，还曾发生过因公来京的工作人员住通铺大炕而被盗走文件的事情。应该说，这个情况是十分严重的。
    最近，北京市第一社会福利公司召开了各区旅店经营管理处业务会议来研究这个问题，决定在不妨碍旅客健康的条件下，让各较大的旅店增添床位。这样在前门、崇文、西单、宣武四个区可以解决约五百个旅客的住宿问题，大大减少来京旅客找不到旅店住的现象。为了便于客人很快找到旅店，各区还设有联络组，掌握各个旅店的空房情况。
    但是，以上措施还不能根本解决北京市旅店不够用的问题。北京市的旅店并不算少，造成目前供不应求现象的主要原因除了旅店的地区分布有些问题以外，主要是由于有很多旅店被机关、部队长期包租了。根据今年三月份的调查，被长期包租旅店的总户数有123户（占全市旅店户数约24％），被长期包租的房间共2，241间（占全部客房间数的30％）。有些被包租的客房使用率很低，只有40％到60％。各单位包租旅店的房租总额每年达847，500元，数字相当惊人。像某单位包租的林春旅社，在最近清产核资时全部资产为3，819元，而每年包租收入则为16，060元，占全部资产的436％。如果把国家一年付出的租金建筑房屋，按每平方公尺六十元造价计算，可建十五平方公尺的房九百多间。很显然，这样长期包租旅店的做法是得不偿失的。
    为了解决这个问题，我们曾经同一些包租旅馆的机关协商，要求他们退租；但是他们都说房屋问题无法解决，不愿退租。我们希望北京市机关房屋管理局和各军、政机关的房屋管理单位迅速研究并合理解决这个问题。
