Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 2nd: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region People's Committee recently transferred 584 vehicles, more than two thousand laborers, and over fifty highway and water conservancy engineering technicians to support the construction work in the Karamay exploration area. All of these vehicles and manpower have already arrived in the Karamay exploration area to participate in transportation, highway construction, and water source exploration work.

After the Karamay oilfield was confirmed to be a promising large oilfield, the drilling scale for developing this oilfield has increased. However, because Karamay is located in the most desolate area of the Junggar Basin, all the materials needed by the exploration area must be transported from very far away, which has caused great difficulties for the development of the oilfield. In early May, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to support the Karamay exploration area. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region People's Committee immediately transferred 534 vehicles from the Transportation Bureau and regional-level agencies to support transportation in the exploration area. The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also transferred fifty vehicles and extracted more than two thousand laborers to support highway construction. The Highway Bureau, Water Conservancy Bureau and other departments also sent technicians to the exploration area to assist in the surveying and design of highways and water pipelines.

    新疆集中人力物力支援克拉玛依探区
    新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会最近抽调了584辆汽车、两千多个劳动力、五十多名公路和水利工程技术人员，支援克拉玛依探区的建设工作。这些汽车和人力，已经全部到达克拉玛依探区参加了运输、公路修建和水源勘测工作。
    克拉玛依油田被证实是一个很有希望的大油田以后，开发这个油田的钻探规模更大了。但是由于克拉玛依位于准噶尔盆地最荒凉的地区，探区所需要的一切物资，都要从很远的地方去运输，使开发油田的工作遇到很大困难。五月初，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会，发出了支援克拉玛依探区的指示，新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会立即从运输局、区级机关，抽调了534辆汽车支援探区运输。中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队，也抽调了五十辆汽车，并且抽出两千多个劳动力支援公路建设。公路局、水利局等部门还派出了技术人员到探区帮助进行公路、输水管线的勘测设计工作。
