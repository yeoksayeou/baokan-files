To prepare well for the popularization of improved rice varieties throughout the province next year, Guangdong Province is comprehensively organizing and evaluating rice varieties.

(By our newspaper) Guangdong Province has comprehensively launched the work of organizing and evaluating local rice varieties in order to prepare for the popularization of improved rice varieties throughout the province next year.

In late May, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture held a seed work conference, which made special arrangements for the work of organizing and evaluating local rice varieties. The conference determined that 19 counties would be the focus of organization and evaluation, and 79 counties would carry out general organization. It was required that through comprehensive investigation, field investigation, selection of improved varieties, mobilizing the masses to select and retain seeds, and indoor identification, excellent varieties of different field types and different maturity periods throughout the province should be selected for promotion next year.

Now that the summer harvest season is approaching, various localities are actively organizing forces to begin a comprehensive survey of rice varieties. In order to solve the problem of insufficient technical personnel, various localities have transferred one or two young commune members with a certain level of education and production experience from agricultural production cooperatives for training.
