    Night of the Fire
    Xi Ping
    May 6th was a very quiet night. In the state-owned Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory, only the guard, Yuan Qisheng, was on duty. It was drizzling. The clock in the guard room had already pointed to twelve o'clock, and it was time for him to get off work. Yuan Qisheng picked up his flashlight and decided to make one last patrol around the factory buildings. As he walked near the second workshop, he suddenly smelled a burnt wood odor. He turned on his flashlight and saw thick smoke pouring out of the doors and window seams of the second workshop.
    "Fire!" Yuan Qisheng exclaimed, and immediately rushed to the telephone room, called the nearby fire brigade, reported the situation, and asked them to come and put out the fire. Then, he anxiously started fighting the fire himself, throwing bags of fire-extinguishing sand at the places where flames were emerging.
    But it had no effect. The flames, along with thick smoke, kept rising. The factory's dangerous goods warehouse was near the second workshop. If the fire spread there, the consequences would be unimaginable. Thinking of this, Yuan Qisheng became even more anxious. "I have to report to the factory director immediately!" he thought. He immediately rushed to the telephone and called the factory director, Hua Jian.
    Yuan Qisheng quickly got through, but he only heard the phone ringing incessantly on the other end. No one answered; the factory director was probably asleep. Now, the most serious accident could happen at any minute, any second. Yuan Qisheng dared not stay by the phone for long. He had to put down the receiver several times and run back to the fire to continue fighting it. He ran to the phone and then back to the fire area, as anxious as an ant on a hot pan. Finally, the phone got through. Yuan Qisheng, breathless, told the factory director the news of the fire in the most concise words. But the reply he heard was an annoyed, even somewhat angry voice:
    "The factory is on fire? Oh! How serious is it? Check the situation and call me back!" *click*, and the phone was hung up.
    Factory Director Hua Jian had a wonderful Sunday today. In the morning, he met with the leaders sent by the higher authorities. In the afternoon, he went to see an interesting play with his daughter. When the phone rang incessantly, he was sleeping in bed with pleasant fatigue. No wonder he was angry that the damned phone call disturbed his good sleep.
    "Ask me to go? It's so late, how can I get there!" As he put down the phone, he kept muttering to himself. A gust of cold spring night air came in from the window, and Director Hua, looking tired, lay down on the bed again.
    But Yuan Qisheng, standing blankly by the phone, was frantic. The fire was continuing to spread, and he couldn't linger by the phone and waste time. He immediately turned back and ran back to the fire area. Fortunately, the fire brigade had arrived by this time. Now, the fire scene was a tense battle. The place where smoke had been rising a moment ago now had roaring flames. The crackling sound of burning wood, the smell of burning cables, and the tense shouts of people were all mixed together. The factory director didn't come, but the workers from nearby came, and the neighbors next door also came. Everyone worked together to put out the fire using various methods. After all, there is strength in numbers. Before long, the fire was finally extinguished.
    When everyone was fighting the fire intensely, they didn't have time to think about Factory Director Hua Jian. But after the fire was extinguished, people naturally thought of the factory director who was still sleeping at home. So many people needed to find the factory director, because many problems caused by the fire urgently needed to be dealt with by the factory director himself. The staff from the power plant, having discovered that the factory's electrical protection equipment was not good, proposed to cut off the main power supply to prevent accidents from happening again, but this would mean the entire factory would have to stop work tomorrow. The people from the Public Security Bureau also needed to find the factory director to investigate the cause of the fire and handle the aftermath. In addition, there were some prescribed procedures that Factory Director Hua needed to handle personally. So, the second phone call was made to Factory Director Hua Jian's dormitory.
    Director Hua picked up the phone receiver annoyedly:
    "The fire is out? That's good, then I won't come."
    He looked out the window; it was so dark that he couldn't see his hand in front of his face. The most annoying thing was that the rain was still drizzling incessantly.
    "How can I walk in this weather? I can't even find transportation. I can't possibly walk to the factory barefoot in the rain!" Thinking of this, Director Hua *click*, hung up the phone again and lazily went back to bed.
    This time, the people at the fire scene were enraged. "This is outrageous!" "How can he still be a Communist Party member!" "The director can out-argue anyone in meetings. He keeps telling us how to protect the people's property. Where did he throw these principles now!" People were discussing angrily. The guard on duty, Yuan Qisheng, taking the anger of all the firefighters, made a third phone call to Director Hua, insisting that he come to the factory to deal with the aftermath.
    More than an hour later, a pedicab brought a sleepy-eyed Director Hua to the factory. When he saw the guard on duty, Yuan Qisheng, he said, half-opening his tired eyes: "What? The factory is on fire? How badly is it burned?"
    It seemed that the factory director hadn't woken up yet.
    Outside, the rain had stopped, and the sky was beginning to turn slightly white.

    失火之夜
    习平
    五月六日，夜很静。在国营上海广播器材厂里只有门警袁启生一个人在值班。天蒙蒙地下着小雨。值班室的时钟已经指向十二点，该到他下班的时候了。袁启生拿起了手电筒，决定再到厂房周围作最后一次巡视。他走到第二车间附近，忽然嗅到一股木头烧焦的气味，打开手电筒一看，只见一股股的浓烟从第二车间的门窗缝向外直涌。
    “火！”袁启生惊叫了一声，立即飞似地奔向电话室，向附近的消防队挂通了电话，报告了情况，要他们前来救火。接着他自己就心急慌忙地动手救火，将灭火用的黄沙一包包向冒出火焰的地方抛过去。
    但一点效果也没有，火焰夹着浓烟，不断地向上窜。二车间近旁就是厂里的危险品仓库，如果一旦火势延烧到那里，发生的后果是不堪设想的。袁启生一想到这里，心里就更焦急。“得赶快报告厂长才是！”他想。他马上赶到电话机旁边，给厂长华坚打电话。
    袁启生很快就把电话接通了，但耳机里只听见对方的电话铃一个劲儿响，没有人接电话，厂长大概是睡着了。现在每分钟、每秒钟都可能发生最严重的事故，袁启生不敢在电话机旁多呆，不得不几次放下电话耳机，奔回到火场去，继续灭火。他一会儿跑到电话机旁，一会儿又跑回火区，真急得像热锅上的蚂蚁似的。最后一次，电话终于叫通了。袁启生上气不接下气地用最精炼的话把失火的消息告诉了厂长。而他听到的回答却是一种厌烦的、甚至带点生气的声音：
    “厂里失火了吗？哦！厉害不厉害？看看情况再打电话来！”啪哒，电话就挂断了。
    厂长华坚今天过了一个美好的星期天，上午，他会见了上级派来的首长，下午，他和女儿去看了一场有趣的戏，当电话铃不断响着的时候，他正带着惬意的疲劳睡在床上。该死的电话铃声搅扰了他的好梦，这就难怪他生气了。
    “叫我去？夜这样深了，怎样走法！”当他搁下电话耳机时，心里不住地嘀咕着。一阵春夜的寒气从窗外袭来，华厂长带着倦容又躺到床上了。
    可是这时候呆呆地立在电话机旁的袁启生却急坏了。火势正在继续蔓延，再不能留恋在电话机旁耽误时间了，他立即又返身奔回火区。幸亏这时候消防队已经赶到了。现在，火场上是一片紧张的搏斗，刚才冒烟的地方，顷刻之间已出现了熊熊的火焰，木板燃烧的噼啪声，电缆烧焦的气味，以及人们紧张的呼叫声混成一片。厂长没有来，但附近的工人们赶来了，隔壁邻居也赶来了。大家一齐用各种方法来救火。毕竟是人多力量大，不多久，火终于被扑灭了。
    当大家在紧张救火的时候，没有时间想到华坚厂长。但火被救熄之后，人们就很自然地想到现在还睡在家里的厂长了。有这样多的人需要找厂长，因为失火惹起的许多问题，急待厂长来亲自处理。发电厂来的工作人员因为发现工厂电线保护设备不好，提出要把总电源切断，防止再度发生意外，但这样明天全厂就要停工。公安局来的人也要找厂长研究火灾的原因和处理善后事宜。此外，还有若干规定的手续要华厂长亲自来处理。这样，第二次的电话又打到了华坚厂长的宿舍。
    华厂长烦恼地拿起了电话听筒：
    “火灭了吗？那好，我就不来了。”
    他望着窗外，天黑得伸手不见五指，最讨厌的是：雨还在淅淅沥沥地下个不停。
    “这样的天气怎么走路，连交通工具也找不到，我总不能淋着雨，光着脚走到厂里去呀！”华厂长想到这里，啪哒，又把电话挂断了，懒洋洋地回到床上。
    这一次可把火场上的人们激怒了，“真是岂有此理！”“这哪里还像是一个共产党员！”“厂长平时开起会来道理谁也说不过他，口口声声叫我们如何爱护人民财产，这些道理他现在丢到哪里去了！”人们气愤地议论着。值班警卫袁启生带着全体救火人员的愤怒，给华厂长打去了第三次电话，一定要他来厂处理善后问题。
    过了一个多小时，三轮车拖着睡眼惺忪的华厂长来到工厂，他看到值班警卫袁启生时，半睁着疲倦的眼睛说：“怎么？厂里失火了？烧得怎样？”
    看样子，厂长好像还没有睡醒。
    屋外，雨停了，天也微微发白了。
