Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 13th: More than 530 tigers, leopards, and over 27,000 wild boars, goats, and other harmful beasts have been killed by the hunting teams composed of militiamen and the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Fujian Province from last winter to recently.

Some places in Fujian are holding exhibitions on eliminating harmful animals. At the exhibition in the Jinjiang area, there is a tiger weighing more than 200 jin. From February to April this year, this tiger killed fourteen head of cattle and thirty-seven pigs and sheep in the Yongchun County area alone. Only after this ferocious tiger was killed could the local peasants produce with peace of mind.

The officers and soldiers of the hunting teams, composed of many excellent shooters and hunters, demonstrated courageous spirit in their battles with wild beasts. Wei Meitong, a militiaman from Xiazhen Township in Jian'ou County, fought a 75-jin tiger alone and finally killed it. In a mountain village in Fujian, one morning, Xiang Yanhua, a squad leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, had not yet gotten up when he suddenly heard the villagers exclaim that a tiger was coming. Xiang Yanhua immediately put on his clothes and ran towards the place where the tiger was coming from with his gun. Unexpectedly, this tiger had already broken into a courtyard, eating a pig while baring its fangs and claws at the door. Xiang Yanhua bravely rushed into the door and fired at the tiger. The tiger struggled and pounced several times violently, but Xiang Yanhua dodged them with his quick and resourceful movements. After a fierce battle, Xiang Yanhua finally shot the tiger to death.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th: The troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Nanjing area are actively helping peasants to harvest wheat in the continuous rainy days. A certain infantry division stationed in a certain place mobilized the entire division on the 9th and 10th to help agricultural producers' cooperatives harvest large areas of mature wheat. All officers and soldiers of a certain military school stationed in Nanjing also participated in the rush harvesting work in the rain on the 9th and 10th, and harvested a total of 524 mu of wheat. A certain unit stationed in Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, dispatched more than 300 people every day for five or six consecutive days to help the local state-owned farm harvest wheat. The exemplary actions of the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army deeply moved the peasants everywhere, and they expressed that they would unite and continue to work hard to resolutely overcome natural disasters.

The leading organs of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Nanjing area issued an emergency instruction on the 11th, requiring the officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in areas threatened by floods to take immediate action and, under the unified leadership of the local Party and government organs, do everything possible to actively participate in flood control, drainage, rush harvesting, and disaster relief work.

This newspaper reports that the work teams to support agricultural cooperation, composed of officers and soldiers directly under the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, after more than three months of work, have assisted farmers of all ethnic groups in the suburbs of the city in establishing and consolidating 30 agricultural producers' cooperatives, including six ethnic minority cooperatives of Yi, Miao, and Minjia nationalities.

Under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, the work team humbly learned from local cadres and the masses, and quickly overcame difficulties such as lack of local work experience and insufficient knowledge of agricultural production. Together with the township and cooperative cadres, they widely publicized the Party's policies on the agricultural cooperation movement to the masses through various means; specifically helped the township and cooperative cadres to handle various specific problems in the establishment of cooperatives; and assisted each cooperative in formulating a comprehensive development plan centered on production. They also worked with the masses to build water conservancy projects, turning many drylands into paddy fields, and transplanted seedlings half a month to a month in advance. It is estimated that the rice yield of these agricultural cooperatives this year will generally increase by 50% to 60% compared with last year.

In the long-term work, they have formed a deep friendship with the cadres and members of various agricultural cooperatives. When they returned to the army, the masses were reluctant to part with them. The members said: We must work hard to improve production in order to repay the support of the People's Liberation Army.

    解放军同农民的友谊
    消灭虎豹等害兽
    据新华社福州13日电　五百三十多只老虎、豹子和二万七千多只野猪、山羊等各种害兽，在从去年冬天到最近的期间，被福建省民兵和中国人民解放军驻福建部队组成的各个打猎队打死。
    福建有些地方正在举行消灭害兽的展览。在晋江地区的展览会上，摆着一只二百多斤重的老虎。这只老虎从今年二月到四月，光在永春县一个地区就咬死了十四头耕牛，三十七只猪和羊。这头猛虎被打死后，当地农民才能安心生产。
    由许多优秀的射手和猎手组成的打猎队的官兵们和民兵们，在和猛兽作战中表现了勇敢的精神。建瓯县下镇乡民兵魏妹筒，单身和一头七十五斤重的老虎搏斗，终于把这头老虎打死。在福建的一个山村里，一天早晨，解放军某部班长项延华还没有起床，忽然听老乡们惊呼老虎来了。项延华马上披上衣服，持枪朝老虎来的地方跑去。不料，这只老虎已经闯进一个院子里，一面吃猪，一面张牙舞爪地看着门口。项延华勇敢地冲进门去，向老虎开枪。老虎挣扎着几次狂暴地扑来，都被项延华机智的动作闪过了。经过一场激烈的战斗，项延华终于把老虎射杀。
    帮助抢收小麦和排涝
    新华社南京13日电　中国人民解放军驻南京地区的部队，在连日阴雨中，积极帮助农民抢收小麦。驻某地某步兵师在九、十两日全师出勤，帮助农业生产合作社抢割大片已成熟的小麦。驻南京某军事学校全体官兵，也在九、十两天中冒雨投入抢收工作，一共抢收了小麦524亩。驻江苏省江浦县某部在连续五、六天中每天出勤三百多人，帮助当地国营农场抢收小麦。人民解放军官兵们的模范行动，使各地农民深受感动，他们纷纷表示要团结一致再接再厉坚决战胜自然灾害。
    人民解放军驻南京地区领导机关已在十一日发出紧急指示，要求驻在受洪水威胁地区的部队官兵立即行动起来，在当地党、政机关的统一领导下，尽一切力量积极参加防汛、排涝、抢收和救灾等工作。
    协助农民建社整社
    本报讯　中国人民解放军驻昆明部队直属队军官和士兵组成的支援农业合作化的工作队，经过了三个多月的工作，协助市郊区各族农民建立和整顿了三十个农业生产合作社，其中包括彝、苗、民家等六个民族社。
    工作队在当地党委统一领导下，虚心向地方干部和群众学习，很快克服了缺乏地方工作经验和农业生产知识不足等困难。他们和乡、社干部一起，通过各种方式，广泛地向群众宣传了党对农业合作化运动的政策；具体地帮助乡、社干部，处理建社工作中的各种具体问题，并且协助各社编制了以生产为中心的全面发展规划。他们还和群众一起兴修水利，使不少旱地变成了水田，并且提前半月到一月栽下了秧，估计这些农业合作社今年水稻产量将较去年普遍增产五、六成。
    在长期的工作中，他们和各农业合作社干部、社员们结成了深厚的友谊。当他们返回部队时，群众都依依不舍。社员们表示：一定要努力搞好生产，来回答解放军对他们的支援。
