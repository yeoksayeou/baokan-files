Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 13th: The first flood peak of the Yellow River this year appeared at Qinchang today, ahead of schedule.

The flood peak reached Qinchang at 6:00 PM today. The flow rate was 3,500 cubic meters per second, a sharp increase of 2,840 cubic meters per second compared to the flow rate on the 9th.

This year, the appearance of the Yellow River's first flood peak is 35 days earlier than last year's first flood peak, and 33 days earlier than the first flood peak in 1954. Because there has been no continuous rainfall in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River, this flood peak did not last long and began to recede.

It is estimated that when this flood peak reaches the Dongming and Puyang sections of Henan Province and enters Shandong Province on the 14th, the low-lying areas of the river滩 [tān] (beach, shoal) may be flooded, but it will not threaten the dikes.

This flood peak mainly originated from the Yellow River's major tributary, the Wei River. After the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters received a report of rising water levels in the Wei River on the 11th, it immediately calculated the time and flow rate of this flood peak reaching the downstream stations of the Yellow River, and notified the counties along the river downstream to prepare. Party and government leading cadres in the counties along the river immediately organized the masses to rush to harvest the wheat on the river滩 [tān] (beach, shoal). It is expected that when the flood peak reaches these counties, the wheat in the灘 [tān] (beach, shoal) area will be harvested.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 13th: The first major flood peak of the Yangtze River's upper reaches has appeared this year.

Since the 9th, continuous heavy rainfall has occurred in various parts of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the water level of the upper reaches of the Jialing River has risen sharply. With the expansion of the rainfall area and the discharge of floodwaters, the water level of the middle and lower reaches of the Jialing River has also risen rapidly. The water level at Beibei Station rose by more than 11 meters in one day, an unprecedented increase. From the 11th, the water level of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River began to rise. The Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River has also experienced continuous heavy rainfall, and the Qingjiang River rose sharply by more than 9 meters in half a day. This has affected the rapid rise of water levels in the Yichang and Shashi areas. The water level in Shashi reached 40.50 meters at 8:00 AM today.

The Han River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, also experienced a major flood peak around the 8th. Now the flood peak has passed Xiangyang and is rushing downstream.

Currently, the rainfall in various parts of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has stopped, but due to continued rainfall in the two湖 [hú] (lake) areas (Hunan and Hubei), coupled with the already high base water levels in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it is estimated that water levels will rise in mid-June.

### 黄河长江出现今年的首次洪峰

    黄河长江出现今年的首次洪峰
    据新华社郑州13日电　黄河今年第一次洪峰今天提前出现于秦厂。
    洪峰在今天十八时到达秦厂。流量为三五○○秒公方，比九日的流量陡增二八四○秒公方。
    今年，黄河的第一次洪峰的出现，比去年的第一次洪峰提前三十五天，比1954年的第一次洪峰提前三十三天。由于黄河中上游地区没有继续下雨，这次洪峰持续不久，就下落了。
    预计这次洪峰，在十四日到达河南省的东明、濮阳河段和进入山东省境内时，河滩低洼地带可能漫滩，但不致威胁堤防。
    这次洪峰主要来源于黄河的大支流渭河。黄河防汛指挥部在十一日得到渭河涨水的报告后，就马上将这次洪峰到达黄河下游各站的时间和流量推算出来，并且通知下游沿河各县作准备。沿河各县党政领导干部，马上组织群众抢收河滩上的麦子。预计当洪峰到达这些县时，滩区的麦子就要收割完了。
    据新华社武汉13日电　长江上游干流今年首次出现较大洪峰。
    从九日起，长江上游各地连续暴雨，嘉陵江上游水位暴涨。随着雨区扩大与洪流下泄，嘉陵江中下游水位也跟着急骤抬高，北碚站水位一天内上涨了十一公尺多，上涨幅度为历年来所没有。从十一日起，长江上游干流水位开始上涨。长江三峡地区也连日暴雨，清江在半天时间内猛涨了九公尺多。这就影响宜昌、沙市一带水位迅速上升。沙市今天八时水位已达四零点五零公尺。
    长江支流汉水在八日前后也出现了一次较大洪峰。现在洪峰已过襄阳，洪峰正在奔流而下。
    目前，长江上游各地雨势已停，但是由于两湖地区又继续降雨，加上长江中、下游底水已高，估计六月中旬水位将呈现上涨局面。
