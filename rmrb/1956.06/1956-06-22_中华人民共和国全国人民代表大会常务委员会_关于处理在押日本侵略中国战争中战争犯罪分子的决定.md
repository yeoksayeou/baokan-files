Japanese war criminals currently detained in our country, during the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China, openly violated the norms of international law and humanitarian principles, committing various crimes against the Chinese people, causing extremely serious damage to our people. According to the crimes they committed, they should be severely punished. However, in view of the changes in the situation and their current circumstances in the ten years since Japan's surrender, the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people in recent years, and the fact that most of these war criminals have shown varying degrees of repentance during their detention, it is decided to deal with these war criminals separately in accordance with the policy of leniency. The principles and related matters for handling imprisoned Japanese war criminals are now stipulated as follows:
	(1) Japanese war criminals who are secondary or have shown better repentance may be treated leniently and exempted from prosecution.
	Japanese war criminals who have committed serious crimes shall be sentenced leniently according to the crimes committed by each criminal and their performance during detention.
	Japanese war criminals who committed other crimes in Chinese territory after Japan's surrender shall be punished jointly for the crimes they committed.
	(2) The trial of Japanese war criminals shall be conducted by a special military tribunal organized by the Supreme People's Court.
	(3) The language and documents used by the Special Military Tribunal should be translated into the language understood by the defendant.
	(4) The defendant may defend himself or hire a lawyer registered with the judicial authorities of the People's Republic of China to defend him. When the Special Military Tribunal deems it necessary, it may also appoint a defender to defend him.
	(5) The judgment of the Special Military Tribunal is the final judgment.
	(6) Criminals who are serving their sentences may be released early if they perform well during their sentence.

    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会
    关于处理在押日本侵略中国战争中战争犯罪分子的决定
    现在在我国关押的日本战争犯罪分子，在日本帝国主义侵略我国的战争期间，公然违背国际法准则和人道原则，对我国人民犯了各种罪行，使我国人民遭受了极其严重的损害。按照他们所犯的罪行本应该予以严惩，但是，鉴于日本投降后十年来情况的变化和现在的处境，鉴于近年来中日两国人民友好关系的发展，鉴于这些战争犯罪分子在关押期间绝大多数已有不同程度的悔罪表现，因此，决定对于这些战争犯罪分子按照宽大政策分别予以处理。现在将处理在押日本战争犯罪分子的原则和有关事项规定如下：
      （一）对于次要的或者悔罪表现较好的日本战争犯罪分子，可以从宽处理，免予起诉。
    对于罪行严重的日本战争犯罪分子，按照各犯罪分子所犯的罪行和在关押期间的表现分别从宽处刑。
    在日本投降后又在中国领土内犯有其他罪行的日本战争犯罪分子，对于他们所犯的罪行，合并论处。
      （二）对于日本战争犯罪分子的审判，由最高人民法院组织特别军事法庭进行。
      （三）特别军事法庭使用的语言和文件，应该用被告人所了解的语言文字进行翻译。
      （四）被告人可以自行辩护，或者聘请中华人民共和国司法机关登记的律师为他辩护。特别军事法庭认为有必要的时候，也可以指定辩护人为他辩护。
      （五）特别军事法庭的判决是终审判决。
      （六）处刑的罪犯在服刑期间如果表现良好，可以提前释放。
