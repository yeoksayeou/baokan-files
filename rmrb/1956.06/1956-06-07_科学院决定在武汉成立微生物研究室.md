Xinhua News Agency. The Chinese Academy of Sciences decided on the 5th to cooperate with Wuhan University and Huazhong Agricultural College to establish a Microbiology Research Laboratory in Wuhan, in order to vigorously carry out research in this discipline, which is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood but is also very weak in our country.

The preparatory work for this research laboratory is being presided over by Gao Shangyin, Dean of Studies at Wuhan University and Director of the Microbiology Teaching and Research Group. The laboratory can be formally established and research work can begin next spring.

This research laboratory plans to conduct research in the following four groups: The Virus Group, led by Gao Shangyin, will mainly study the basic problems of animal and plant viruses and bacterial viruses (bacteriophages). The Soil Microbiology Group, led by Chen Huagui, Director of the Department of Soil and Agricultural Chemistry at Huazhong Agricultural College, will mainly study the life activities of soil microorganisms and their interrelationships with plants and soil. The Biological Control of Plant Diseases Group, led by Yang Xinmei, Director of the Department of Plant Protection at Huazhong Agricultural College, will mainly study the use of microorganisms to control plant diseases. The Microbial Variation, Genetics, and Breeding Group, led by Zhao Baoguo, Deputy Director of the Microbiology Teaching and Research Group at Wuhan University, will mainly study the variation, genetics, and selection of bacteria (including actinomycetes) and their bacteriophages.

    科学院决定在武汉成立微生物研究室
    新华社讯　中国科学院五日决定同武汉大学、华中农学院合作在武汉建立一个微生物研究室，以便大力开展对国计民生有重要意义同时在我国又是十分薄弱的这门学科的研究。
    这个研究室的筹备工作由武汉大学教务长、微生物教研组主任高尚荫主持。明年春天可以正式建室和开展研究工作。
    这个研究室准备分下列四个组进行研究工作：病毒组，主要研究动植物的病毒和细菌病毒（噬菌体）的基本问题，由高尚荫领导。土壤微生物组，主要研究土壤微生物的生命活动及其同植物、土壤之间的互相关系，由华中农学院土壤农化系主任陈华癸领导。植病的生物防治组，主要研究利用微生物防治植物病害，由华中农学院植物保护系主任杨新美领导。微生物的变异、遗传及育种组，主要研究细菌（包括放线菌）及其噬菌体变异，遗传及选种，由武汉大学微生物教研组副主任赵保国领导。
