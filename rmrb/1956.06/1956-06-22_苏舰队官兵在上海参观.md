Shanghai, June 21 (By our own correspondent) – A group of officers and soldiers from the Soviet friendly visiting fleet set out in the first batch this morning to visit factories, schools, workers' cultural palaces, the former residence of Sun Yat-sen, and the Lu Xun Memorial Hall in Shanghai. The distinguished guests received warm welcomes from people in each unit.

    In the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, the guests saw blackboard newspapers put up in various workshops to welcome the Soviet fleet. In the newly built, tall, and bright steam turbine workshop, guests gathered around a Soviet grinding machine, watching with great interest as it ground the main shaft of a 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine. The factory director, engineers, and workers visited the entire factory hand-in-hand with the guests.

    At the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Soviet naval officers and soldiers took photos with the female textile workers in the workshops and factory gardens, and exchanged gifts.

    While visiting the Workers' Cultural Palace, the distinguished guests joined in a get-together with students from the workers' amateur dance training class who were rehearsing dances. Students from Fuxing Middle School presented the guests with two models of a destroyer that they had created. During the visit to Tongji University, hosts and guests took photos and exchanged gifts as souvenirs. Several students from the second year of the Railway Special School took out a package of bookmarks to give to their Soviet friends. Ni Jingxian, a graduate of the Industrial Surveying Department, gave a photo to the guests, and Soviet sailor Sasha also forwarded a photo of his younger sister Nadya to Wang Bizhen, a second-year student in the Industrial Surveying Department.
