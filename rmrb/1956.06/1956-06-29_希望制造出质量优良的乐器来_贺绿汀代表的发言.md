In the great economic and cultural construction of our country, I would like to offer some opinions and suggestions on some issues that are not very well noticed, for reference.

Since liberation, literary and art groups, schools, and the military have successively purchased many foreign musical instruments, and this foreign exchange expenditure is considerable. With the continuous development of the motherland's culture, the demand for musical instruments will continue to increase. Therefore, if we do not find our own solutions, we will continue to consume a large amount of foreign exchange.

In terms of musical instrument manufacturing, we have abundant raw materials and a certain technical foundation, but it is still in a state of self-sufficiency, without good organization and leadership, and therefore has not received the development it deserves.

For example, in piano manufacturing, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were many piano factories in Shanghai, which manufactured more than 30,000 pianos in total. In terms of raw materials, except for steel wires, hammer action parts, and more than a dozen types of felt, most of them were domestic materials. Our pianos were made very well and could compete with foreign goods. In the past, more than 10,000 pianos were exported to Southeast Asia and other places. After liberation, the music and cultural undertakings developed unprecedentedly, but in piano manufacturing, due to the inability to import some foreign raw materials, and our own factories did not find ways to manufacture these materials, piano manufacturing became difficult. We have been barely managing by relying on old piano refurbishment and a small amount of inventory. But now it has reached a state of complete exhaustion. At present, the joint state-private factories in Shanghai and factories in Beijing and Northeast China are also manufacturing hammer action parts themselves, but because of the high cost and poor quality, not many people are willing to buy them. I suggest that the Ministry of Light Industry should make a comprehensive plan for piano manufacturing based on reality. Since the level of industry in our country is not high, it is impossible to manufacture these foreign materials and semi-finished products ourselves in a short period of time, and even if we do, it will not be easy to meet the standards. Therefore, we should purchase the required amount of foreign materials from the original import sources to ensure the quality of piano manufacturing. Then, designate our own felt factories to trial-produce felts of various specifications for piano manufacturing. Order a complete set of machines for manufacturing piano parts from East Germany or Czechoslovakia, and hire experts to guide us, so that we can make high-quality hammer action parts ourselves. As for the steel wires used for pianos, it is impossible to manufacture them ourselves in a short period of time, so we must order them from foreign countries in a planned way.

Secondly, in terms of orchestral instruments, we have spent a lot of money buying a lot of foreign instruments, but the general quality is not very ideal. At present, we are also manufacturing them in large quantities, but there are many problems. Generally, we are working hard to increase production in quantity, but the quality is generally poor. The reason is that factories want to make money, at least to break even, while department stores want to lower prices, and they are laymen when it comes to quality issues, either not caring or interfering randomly. We know that the quality of musical instruments made from the same two pieces of wood can differ by several times to dozens of times. If we do not work hard to improve the quality, it will be impossible to solve the problem of musical instruments for professional musicians. Therefore, the current situation is that a large number of inferior musical instruments are overstocked and no one buys them, while musicians and music groups are struggling to buy suitable musical instruments. Therefore, they have no choice but to spend a lot of money to buy foreign musical instruments.

The musical instrument making studio attached to the East China Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music has produced some stringed instruments of quite good quality, which can replace imported goods. A flute player in the Shanghai Orchestra spent several years making a very good flute. The wind instruments made by the Beijing Yihua Musical Instrument Factory are also very beautiful (of course, I am not a wind instrument expert and cannot understand its performance in detail). I heard that the Tianjin Worker-Peasant-Soldier Musical Instrument Factory makes very good trumpets, and there are also factories in Dalian. Of course, these situations are not comprehensive. From the above situation, it is proved that we are fully capable of making excellent musical instruments. Musical instrument manufacturing is not just a craft problem, but also related to science and music art. Musical instrument makers are not just workers, but also should be artists. The Soviet and Czechoslovak governments attach great importance to artists in this field. Therefore, I hope that the government will pay attention to, reward, and train experts in this field. At the same time, musical instrument makers should cooperate with performers, because only performers can best understand the performance of each instrument. In foreign countries, the best musical instruments are often appraised and signed by famous performers. The Soviet Union has a batch of the most valuable musical instruments, which are kept by the National Organizing Committee. Their performers use these instruments when participating in international competitions. These experiences are worth learning. Because a very good performer will be greatly discounted without a good musical instrument. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this. Of course, while manufacturing these high-quality musical instruments, we should also pay attention to manufacturing qualified ordinary musical instruments to meet the needs of amateur performers and beginners, but it is also required that the pitch and size ratio meet the specifications, so as not to develop bad habits for the performers.

The above suggestions can also be fully applied to the manufacture of national musical instruments. We must learn from the manufacturing experience of foreign musical instruments to cultivate experts in the manufacture of national musical instruments, so that our national musical instruments can not only maintain the characteristics of national musical instruments, but also greatly increase the effectiveness of performance.

In terms of raw materials for musical instrument manufacturing, we have many valuable raw materials, but we don't know it ourselves, but foreigners do. For example, the reeds used for wind instruments are consumables, and we have to spend a few US dollars each to buy them from foreign countries, but we have the world's best reeds that can be used to make reeds, such as in Xiangtan and Liling in Hunan Province, which are called Luzhu or Mian bamboo by the locals. Before liberation, foreigners bought them in those places, but now no one buys them. I heard that there are also some in Anhui and Guizhou. Of course, the selection, harvesting of reeds and the manufacture of reeds must go through a series of professional technical processes. As far as I know, countries such as the Soviet Union, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and North Korea do not produce this kind of reed. If we set up factories for production in a planned way, we can not only meet the requirements of brother countries, but also exchange for a large amount of foreign exchange.

Another example is the suede used in pianos, organs, and accordions. We are a raw hide exporting country, but we have to spend a lot of money to buy suede products from foreign countries. Our own tanneries can completely make them. It is said that the roe deer skin produced in Northeast China is better than suede. Another example is the fish skin used for the keys of all woodwind instruments. Musical instrument factories cannot buy this kind of skin, so they have to use sheepskin instead, but I heard that the Shanghai Aquatic Products School has a fish skin tanning research room.

Musical instrument manufacturing requires many kinds of precious wood. We have most of them. In Czechoslovakia, musical instrument manufacturing is a fairly important national enterprise, under the management of the Ministry of Forestry. Therefore, I hope that the timber research departments of our Ministry of Forestry will pay special attention to the discovery, protection, planned logging, storage, and supply of various precious woods required for musical instrument manufacturing.

Our country is "vast in territory and rich in resources." We don't know how rich it is. In order to meet the needs of the people of our country in all aspects, we should also pay attention to the materials in the secondary aspects pointed out above.

In the great socialist economic reform of our country, the relationship between supply and marketing has undergone fundamental changes, changing all the previous unreasonable phenomena. However, this change should be a very detailed work, and we should understand in detail the specific situation of all aspects of supply and marketing in the past, and reform it on this specific basis.

I heard that the python skin used for making erhus cannot be bought now, there is no skin for making drums, and copper for making gongs is also difficult to obtain. The beard used by old men in Beijing opera is the tail hair of yaks in Tibet, and it is also difficult to buy now. I think it is not that there are no these materials, but that our supply and marketing departments have not paid attention to these unimportant aspects, which has caused difficulties.

    希望制造出质量优良的乐器来
    ——贺绿汀代表的发言
    在我国伟大的经济与文化的建设中，我想对某些不很被人注意的问题，提出一些意见和建议，作为参考。
    解放以来，文艺团体学校与部队先后购买了很多的外国乐器，这一笔外汇是可观的，随着祖国文化不断发展，所需要的乐器将会不断的增加。因此如果不自己想办法，就会继续消耗大量外汇。
    在乐器制造方面，我们有很丰富的原材料，也有一定的技术基础，但至今尚处于自流状态，没有很好的组织领导，因而没有得到应有的发展。
    譬如钢琴制造，抗日战争以前，上海有很多家钢琴制造厂，前后制造出的钢琴在3万架以上，在原材料方面，除了钢丝，捶弦机件及十余种呢子等以外，大部是本国材料。我们的钢琴作得很好，能与外国货竞争。过去出口远销南洋各地的琴在1万架以上。解放以后，音乐文化事业空前发展，而在钢琴制造方面，由于一部分外国原材料不能进口，自己的工厂也没有设法制造这些材料，因此钢琴的制造就发生困难。仅仅依靠旧琴翻新及少量存货勉强凑合。但目前已到了完全枯竭的状态了。目前上海公私合营的厂及北京东北的厂虽然也在自己制造捶弦机件，但是因为成本高、质量差，愿意买的人不多。我建议轻工业部对钢琴制造问题应从实际出发作全面的计划，由于我国工业的水平不高，这些外国材料及半制成品不可能在短时期内自己制造出来，作出来了也不容易合规格，因此应该向原来进口的地方购进应有数量的外国材料，以保证钢琴制造的质量。然后指定我们自己的制呢厂试制钢琴制造用的各种规格的呢子。向民主德国或捷克斯洛伐克订购制造钢琴机件的全套机器，聘请专家指导，然后可以自己作出质量高的捶弦机件来。至于钢琴用的钢丝，不可能在短时期内自己制造出来，就必须有计划的向外国订购。
    其次，在管弦乐器方面，我们花了很多的钱买了很多的外国乐器，但一般的质量都很不理想。目前我们自己也在大量制造，但其中存在很多问题，一般都是努力在数量上增产，在质量上大都很差，原因是工厂要赚钱，起码要保本自给，而百货公司却要压低价钱，对质量问题则是外行，不是不管，就是乱管。我们知道，同是两块木头作出来的乐器，好坏可以相差数倍到数十倍。我们如不在质量上努力提高，就不可能解决职业的音乐工作者的乐器问题，因而目前的情况是大量的劣质乐器积压无人购买，而音乐工作者与音乐团体又苦于买不到合用的乐器。因而也不得不花很多的钱买外国的乐器。
      中央音乐学院华东分院附设的乐器制作室，制作出一些质量相当好的弦乐器，可以代替进口货。上海乐团一位长笛演奏家花了数年工夫作出了一枝很好的长笛，北京艺华乐器厂作出来的管乐器也很漂亮
  （当然我不是管乐专家不能很细致的了解它的性能）。听说天津的工农兵乐器厂小号作得很好，大连也有厂，这些情况当然很不全面。从以上的情况证明我们完全有条件可以作出出色的乐器来的。乐器制造不单是个手艺问题，也与科学与音乐艺术有关，乐器制造者不单是个工人，而且应该是个艺术家。苏联和捷克斯洛伐克政府对这方面的艺术家是很重视的。因此希望政府重视奖励与培养这方面的专家，同时乐器制造者要与演奏家合作，因为只有演奏家才是最能了解每一种乐器的性能。在外国最好的乐器往往都经过著名的演奏家鉴定并签字。苏联国家掌握了一批最名贵的乐器，由国家组织委员会来保管，他们的演奏家参加国际竞赛时，就用这些乐器。这些经验都是值得我们学习的。因为一个很好的演奏家如果没有很好的乐器，就会要打很大的折扣。过去我们在这方面的注意是不够的。当然与制造这些优质乐器的同时，还要注意制造合格的普通乐器以适应业余演奏者与初学学生的需要，但也要求音准与尺寸比例上合乎规格，以免演奏者养成坏习惯。
    以上建议也完全可以适用于民族乐器的制造，我们要学习外国乐器的制造经验来培养民族乐器的制造专家，使我们的民族乐器既能保持民族乐器的特色，同时又能大大增加演奏上的效能。
    在乐器制造的原料方面，我们有许多很宝贵的原料，自己不知道，外国人反而知道。譬如管乐器用的簧片，这是个消耗品，我们要花几块美金一个向外国购买，而我们自己有可作簧片的世界上最好的芦苇，如湖南湘潭醴陵等地，当地人称为芦竹或绵竹，解放以前外国人在那些地方收买，现在反没有人买了，听说安徽、贵州等地都有，当然，对芦苇的选择收割与簧片的制造必须经过一系列的专业性的技术过程，据所知，苏联、德国、波兰、捷、匈、罗、朝鲜等国家都不出产这种芦苇，我们如有计划的设厂生产，不但可以满足兄弟国家的要求，还可以换回大批外汇。
    又如钢琴、风琴、手风琴中所用的一种材料——麂皮，我们是原皮出口国，但麂皮的制成品我们必须花很贵的钱向外国购买。我们自己的制革厂完全可以作的。据说东北所产的一种麅皮比麂皮更好，又如所有木管乐器键子上所用的皮是鱼皮，乐器厂买不到这种皮，只好用羊皮代替，但听说上海水产学校就有鱼皮制革研究室。
    乐器制造需要许多种名贵木料，这方面我们大部都有，在捷克斯洛伐克，乐器制造是国家相当重要的企业，属林业部管理。因此希望我国林业部的木材研究部门特别注意供乐器制造所需要的各种名贵木材的发现、保护、计划砍伐、贮藏、供应等问题。
    我国“地大物博”，到底博到如何程度，我们自己还不清楚。为了满足我国人民各方面的需要，对像上面所指出次要方面的物资也应该注意到。
    在我国伟大的社会主义经济改革中，供销关系产生了根本的变化，改变了以前一切不合理的现象，不过这种改变应该是个很细致的工作，应该很细致的了解过去一切供销方面的具体情况，在这个具体基础上加以改革。
    听说目前作胡琴用的蟒皮买不到了，作鼓没有皮，作锣的铜也很困难。京戏老生用的胡子是西藏牦牛的尾巴毛，现在也很难买到，我想并不是没有这些物资，而是我们的供销部门没有注意到这些不重要的方面，因而产生困难。
