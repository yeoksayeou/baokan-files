During the busy farming season, it is warmly welcomed by the peasant masses when commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives deliver goods to the countryside. However, some staff members deliver goods to the countryside not to facilitate the purchase of the masses, but to facilitate their own "getting rid of burdens."

Such things happened in Nanxiang District, Jiading County, Jiangsu Province. In mid-April, three staff members from the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company came to sell salted hairtail on credit, and they started by asking others to complete a "political task." They distributed the "task" of selling salted fish on credit from the district to the township, and from the township to the cooperative. Fengbang Township accepted the "task" of promoting 7,000 catties of salted fish, and in the midst of their busy schedule, they even appointed a militia platoon leader to be specifically responsible for promoting salted fish on credit.

According to the plan of the staff of the Aquatic Products Company, the Huangyu First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Taiping Township should buy 2,000 catties. The cooperative members had pickled a lot of fish themselves last winter, but under the repeated emphasis on the "national plan" by the staff of the Aquatic Products Company, the cooperative leaders finally had to purchase 1,600 catties, and then assigned it as a task to lower levels. The Jiannong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengbang Township had a production team of 75 households, and was allocated 620 catties of salted fish. Some cooperative members said angrily: "I am willing to pay the money, but I will resolutely refuse the salted fish!"

The Nanxiang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiading County also had compulsory phenomena in promoting goods.

The staff of this cooperative bundled the goods to be sold on credit together, with five rolls of fruit candy, two boxes of raisins, half a catty of candied fruit, and one bag of preserved tangerine peel as one share, each share costing 1.2 yuan. They allocated shares level by level, from the township, cooperative, and production team to the household, one share per household. For this matter, the township and agricultural production cooperative staff were busy for several days.

By the time the county and district leading organs discovered these situations, the staff of the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company had already "sold on credit" more than 63,800 catties of salted fish in Nanxiang District, and the Nanxiang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative had also "sold on credit" 17,246 rolls of fruit candy, 2,020 boxes of raisins, 2,682 catties of biscuits...

This kind of coercive practice has been criticized in the past, but the leaders of these units have not taken it as a lesson, and have not conducted sufficient ideological education for their staff, so the staff members do whatever they want when they get to the lower levels. If there is a large inventory of some commodities, and they are not easy to store, and there is a danger of mildew and deterioration in the summer, these commodities should be actively promoted; however, it is necessary to consider taking the correct method to promote them and promote them to those consumers who really need them. It is completely wrong to use the method of compulsory order to assign commodity quotas. (Attached picture)

    不能把推销变成摊派
    张少昕
    在农忙季节，商业部门和供销合作社送货下乡，是受到农民群众热烈欢迎的。但是有的工作人员送货下乡，不是为了便利群众购买，而是为了便于自己“丢包袱”。
    在江苏嘉定县南翔区，就发生过这样的事情。四月中旬，上海市水产公司来了三个赊销咸带鱼的工作人员，开口就是要别人来完成“政治任务”他们把赊销咸鱼的“任务”，从区分配到乡，从乡分配到社。封浜乡接受了推销七千斤咸鱼的“任务”，在百忙之中，还指定了一个民兵连长专门负责赊销咸鱼。
    按照水产公司工作人员的计划，太平乡黄裕第一农业生产合作社应当买二千斤。社员们去年冬天自己腌的鱼很多，但是在水产公司的工作人员一再强调“国家计划”的情况下，社的领导人员最后不得不认购一千六百斤，然后当作任务摊派下去。封浜乡建农农业生产合作社有一个生产大队共七十五户，分配到咸鱼六百二十斤，有的社员愤慨地说：“钞票我肯出，咸鱼坚决不要！”
    嘉定县南翔区供销合作社在推销商品中也有强迫的现象。
    这个社的工作人员把要赊销的商品搭配在一起，以水果糖五卷、葡萄干二盒、蜜饯半斤、陈皮梅一包作为一股，每股一元二角。他们由乡、社、大队到户，按级向下摊派，每户一股。为了这事，乡的和农业生产合作社的工作人员都忙碌了几天。
    等到县、区领导机关发现这些情况的时候，上海市水产公司的工作人员，在南翔区已经“赊销”了六万三千八百多斤咸鱼，南翔区供销社也“赊销”出水果糖17，246卷、葡萄干2，020盒，饼干2，682斤……
    这种强迫命令的做法，过去不是没有受到过指责的，可惜这些单位的领导人员没有引为教训，没有向所属工作人员进行充分的思想教育，因此工作人员到了下边就随便乱干。有些商品库存多了一些，又不易保管，夏季一来就有霉烂变质的危险，对于这些商品是应当积极推销的；可是必须考虑采取正确的方法来推销。以及向那些实在需要的消费者推销。用强迫命令的方法来摊派商品是完全错误的。（附图片）
