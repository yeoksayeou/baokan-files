Today I will not talk about issues related to the forestry industry.

Today, I would like to share my personal understanding and opinions on the current issue of senior intellectuals in our country.

People's Congress representatives and CPPCC members jointly inspected the situation of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, last winter, and wrote a total of nearly 600,000 words of written reports. In my position on the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC, I and more than a dozen committee members and professors were responsible for studying all the written reports. As all representatives will recall, the issue of senior intellectuals was quite complex during the inspection last year, involving a wide range of aspects. We compiled over 390 items from the written reports. One item might involve the issues of just one or two senior intellectuals, or the problems of several academic units, or even the common issues of all senior academic institutions and all senior intellectuals across a certain region or the entire country. The Standing Committee of the CPPCC has now forwarded the processed materials to approximately thirty relevant central departments for consultation on solutions. We hope to understand the truth behind each item and gradually find appropriate solutions. We believe that as long as state organs and state personnel earnestly and practically implement the Party and government's policies on the issue of senior intellectuals, the issue can be gradually resolved.

Achievements in Solving the Issue of Senior Intellectuals

What are the Party and government's policies on the issue of senior intellectuals? Premier Zhou Enlai delivered two important reports this January, one being "Report on the Issue of Intellectuals" and the other being the "Political Report" at the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. Premier Zhou put forward three principles in both reports regarding the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals: (1) improve the use and arrangement of intellectuals; (2) give intellectuals due trust and support; and (3) provide intellectuals with the necessary working conditions and appropriate treatment. At the same time, Premier Zhou also instructed intellectuals to "adopt methods of self-education, and gradually grow into intellectuals who serve socialism wholeheartedly through observing and practicing social life, engaging in professional practice, and studying Marxist-Leninist theory." This policy is correct, practical, and warmly supported by intellectuals across the country.

Now let's examine the actual implementation of this policy. Today we can affirm that Party and government organizations at all levels have done a lot of concrete work and achieved significant results in solving the issue of senior intellectuals over the past four months. To give a few concrete examples, a common and serious complaint among senior intellectuals last year was the problem of insufficient time, the problem of being too busy and disorganized. Since the government proposed ensuring five-sixths of the working day for professional work, according to my personal understanding, about three-quarters or more of professors and scientists in Beijing have initially resolved the time issue. Generally speaking, universities and colleges in Beijing have mostly adopted or are trying to adopt effective measures to reduce the time professors and scientists spend on non-professional meetings and administrative matters. To solve the problem of the lack of books and materials, many units are reorganizing their existing books and are ordering new books and materials to the extent possible and necessary. In terms of equipping them with assistants, some units have resolved some personnel establishment issues and are striving to add staff. Many units are conducting reasonable salary adjustments under possible conditions. I believe the representatives present here already know that after the recent decision of the State Council to reform salaries is implemented, the salaries of intellectuals, especially scientific and technological workers, will be increased more substantially. Over the past four months, the leading Party has admitted a large number of senior intellectuals into the Party, which is the most glorious prospect for old intellectuals. This has greatly boosted the confidence and work enthusiasm of non-Party senior intellectuals.

The Issue of Relations between Party Members and Non-Party Members

Does this mean that the issue of senior intellectuals has been completely resolved? We cannot make such a conclusion too early today. Comparing the materials from the representatives' and committee members' most recent inspection with the materials from the second inspection last year, some issues among senior intellectuals still exist. Of course, some issues cannot be resolved immediately due to objective difficulties. I will not talk about these types of issues today. But there are also some issues that have not been resolved due to the insufficient subjective efforts of both senior intellectuals and some state personnel. What I want to specifically mention today is the issue of unity, mainly the issue of relations between Party members and non-Party members, the issue of "a certain gap still exists" between some intellectuals and Party members, as pointed out by Premier Zhou in his report. It is beneficial for us to openly discuss such an issue today.

It must be affirmed that the vast majority of intellectuals sincerely accept the leadership of the Party and sincerely support the government. But this does not mean that there are no gaps at all between some intellectuals and Party members. The policies of the Party and government are clear. However, it is also an undeniable fact that some intellectuals and a small number of Party members do not understand or implement the policies well enough. There are several points here that deserve our attention: First, according to a small portion of the materials from the most recent inspection, the degree of implementation of Party and government policies seems to be lower in some areas that are further away from Beijing, the capital, where there is less understanding of the policies. The materials from a recent inspection in a certain area have a striking example: some individuals believe that improving the living conditions and working conditions of senior intellectuals is a case of "those who fought the battle to win the country don't get to sit, while those who sit in the country didn't fight the battle." Although this is just an individual's erroneous view, it shows that some people still have not studied Premier Zhou's two reports well, and lack understanding of the Party's consistent policy of valuing intellectuals and the Party's united front policy. Such erroneous views not only cannot eliminate this gap, but will certainly strengthen it. Second, the responsibility for the gap between some senior intellectuals and Party members lies with both sides, but Premier Zhou instructed Party members to "take the initiative to eliminate this gap," which I think is a brilliant instruction. According to the materials in the most recent inspection report, some Party members have not made enough proactive efforts in this regard. Take the issue of "having the position but not the authority" for example. Due to the excessive enthusiasm of individual Party members in daring to take on responsibilities, they have neglected the boundaries of their authority, which has caused sensitivity among others who feel they "have the position but no authority" and are just holding down the job without doing anything. People who have such sensitivity, but do not adopt the attitude of masters of their own affairs to launch criticism, strive for cooperation, and jointly complete their responsibilities, are also wrong. Such things continue to create unnecessary gaps. Third, over the past few years, the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, and ideological remolding movements have undoubtedly fundamentally improved the thinking of intellectuals and strengthened unity with them. However, some deviations that occasionally occurred in past movements have also increased the caution and fear of some old intellectuals. Some senior intellectuals, due to unclear understanding and insufficient comprehension of the Party's policies, even regard the deviations of individual Party members as the Party's policies. They then have all kinds of concerns and worries, and say little, say nothing, or are afraid to speak on people and things. On the one hand, since they are "tight-lipped," others keep them at arm's length, which inevitably preserves the gap. Due to the existence of these various gaps, the potential of some senior intellectuals has not been fully realized today, which is also a fact.

Fully Unleash the Potential of Senior Intellectuals

How to eliminate gaps, further strengthen unity, and fully unleash the potential of existing senior intellectuals is a critical issue for the country today. I believe that Chairman Mao Zedong's call for "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is the right remedy for eliminating the gap between Party members and non-Party members and strengthening unity.

"Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" can have two good effects: on the one hand, it educates some Party members and the leaders of our Party factions, groups, and institutions to let others speak, listen to others speak, tolerate others' speech, and respect others' right to freedom of speech; on the other hand, it encourages some other passive and silent senior intellectuals to be willing to speak, speak more, speak boldly, and cherish their right to freedom of speech.

The existing 100,000 senior intellectuals in China are mostly intellectuals who grew up in the old society. The higher their academic attainments, the deeper the roots of their old knowledge. In such a world-shaking tide of socialist ideological remolding, it is inevitable that some old senior intellectuals have some concerns. They have political concerns, fearing being labeled, fearing making political mistakes, and fearing being criticized and attacked. They have professional concerns, with old knowledge being outdated and new theories being confusing. Their minds are empty and their hearts are wandering. This phenomenon is abnormal and unhealthy. But the fact is the fact after all. Improving this fact certainly requires intellectuals to strengthen their study of Marxism-Leninism and improve their thinking on the one hand. But on the other hand, the state personnel responsible for uniting and transforming intellectuals in all aspects must also face reality, seek truth from facts, and help such intellectuals solve these problems.

Realizing "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," Eliminating Concerns

In my personal opinion, I believe that after the "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" called for by Chairman Mao Zedong is truly launched, it will inevitably dispel the political concerns and professional concerns of old senior intellectuals. Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee Lu Dingyi said the following in his report "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend":

"What we advocate for 'Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' is promoting the freedom of independent thinking, the freedom of debate, the freedom of creation and criticism, and the freedom to express one's own opinions, insist on one's own opinions, and reserve one's own opinions in literary and artistic work and scientific research work." Today, with these guarantees of freedom, what concerns do senior intellectuals still have? All senior intellectuals across the country should contribute all their knowledge as much as possible. There is an old Chinese saying: "The wise may err a thousand times, but the foolish may gain once," and even a single gain from foolishness, even a little bit of knowledge, is a contribution. The old intellectuals of China, after years of education and training by the Party, have generally improved, and today they can make contributions in criticizing and sorting out old academics. In terms of science, criticizing the academics of idealists does not necessarily require fundamentally negating Newton's law of "a body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion stays in motion," nor does it require completely obliterating Einstein's discovery of the "theory of relativity." Here, old scientists can make many useful contributions. State organs and state personnel should not underestimate the progress of intellectuals today, and at the same time, old intellectuals do not need to overestimate their past work and achievements, and be "unduly humble." "Don't be afraid of not recognizing the goods, just be afraid of comparing the goods." As long as intellectuals present all their ideological goods, through free discussion, free debate, free criticism, and free competition, the results of high and low, good and bad, and what to take and what to discard will be obtained. Old intellectuals will gain the opportunity to learn Marxism-Leninism through such practical competition, and further improve and transform themselves! In this way, sectarianism, dogmatism, and stereotyped writing will certainly be eliminated and cleared away!

On the Issue of How to Realize "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"

From the latest inspection feedback, we know that senior intellectuals across the country warmly support the call for "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," and all believe that this is a great encouragement to intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, to give play to their initiative and creativity. However, there are still some doubts about how to realize "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" and how to develop "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

Some people believe that a basic understanding of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" should be that it must go through long-term research and truly become a "school of thought." I think these conditions are too demanding and proposed too early. The urgent issue for the country today is how to encourage and promote intellectuals to "bloom," to "contend," not how to prevent intellectuals from "being willing to bloom," "blooming more," or even some "blooming randomly." Who is a "school of thought"? Who is not a "school of thought"? We certainly cannot admit that "blooming" is a "school of thought." If "blooming must be a school of thought, and those who are not a school of thought must not bloom," and if we must first determine such a standard for "schools of thought," this will inevitably cause hundreds of blooms to contend for "schools of thought," rather than "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." As a result, in literary and artistic work and scientific research work, the current sectarianism and dogmatism may monopolize and control again, disheartening the old intellectuals who were originally hesitant, and squeezing and oppressing the young emerging forces.

Some people believe that "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a product of the turbulent era of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, and it is impossible to develop "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in an organized, led, and disciplined socialist country. I think this is a wrong view. "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the turbulent Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods is different in essence from "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the socialist era, and "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the era of individualism is different from "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the era of collectivism. "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the turbulent era was each for its own master and each forming its own school of thought, just as the Book of Han says, "Each citing one end, exalting what they favored, using this to persuade and win over the feudal lords." The Confucians said: "Yang Zhu is for himself, which is to be without a ruler; Mozi's universal love is to be without a father; to be without a father and without a ruler is to be beasts." Such contention where you scold me as a beast and I scold you as a beast, such contention where they despise each other and hate each other, although it did play a role in each shining brightly at the time, it ultimately resulted in incompatibility and mutual annihilation rather than mutual generation. "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the socialist collectivist era is a contention within the people, a contention where everyone has a common goal, a common direction, and a common future, and a contention where they help and cooperate with each other. To use music as a metaphor, in a scattered and turbulent era, in an era of individualism, each beats its own gong and each beats its own drum, with the gongs and drums sounding loudly and the tones being chaotic. From such "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," the people do not get much benefit from the music. "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the socialist, collectivist era is like a great orchestra. In the orchestra, those who play the piano, those who play the flute, those who beat the gong, and those who beat the drum, each have their own specialties in instruments, and each shows their own unique skills in technology, and the technical specialties of these musicians complement each other and enhance each other. The artistic level of the orchestra is combined with the artistic development of each member. It encourages members to specialize in art according to their strengths, and it will never bury the musical talent of any member. The orchestra's performance methods include solo performances by individuals, duets by two people, quartets by four people, and performances of symphonies by the whole orchestra. It wants to play all kinds of music scores that the people want to listen to and that the people like to listen to, and the musicians themselves can also compile all kinds of music scores, so that the musicians can do their best and show their talents. But the purpose of the orchestra is to serve the people, and the purpose of each member of the orchestra must also be to serve the people. In this way, the orchestra must have organization, leadership, and command when performing for the audience, and then the performance will have harmony and rhythm. Such "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is what the people need today and is suitable for today's era. This is the difference between "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the collectivist socialist era and "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the turbulent Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods.

In the inspection materials, some people believe that "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is limited to the scope of the constitution, which restricts freedom of speech. I think it is an absurd idea if someone hopes that in "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," they can violate the constitution, violate the patriotic stance, and fail to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. We must recognize that the constitution of the people's democratic country is a law made by the people themselves, and everyone has the obligation to abide by it. The constitution is a weapon for the people to defend themselves, not a tool for the government to oppress the people. We must remember that Article 87 of the Constitution stipulates that citizens have freedom of speech and publication, "The state provides the necessary material facilities to guarantee citizens' enjoyment of these freedoms." Article 95 of the Constitution stipulates that citizens have the freedom to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities, "The state encourages and helps citizens engaged in science, education, literature, art, and other cultural undertakings in their creative work." This is the legal basis for "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Chairman Mao Zedong's call for "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is precisely the fulfillment of the duties of the highest leader of the state under the Constitution. At the same time, with such a constitution, "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" truly has legal protection. In this way, the existing senior intellectuals across the country can each rely on their abilities and show their unique skills, rejoice, encourage each other, and strive to be the first to boldly "bloom" and boldly "contend"!

Make Redoubled Efforts and Play a Leading Role in "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"

Finally, I want to talk about the tasks of our China Democratic League in the issue of senior intellectuals. The fact that some issues of senior intellectuals have not been resolved in a timely manner, especially that senior intellectuals have not fully unleashed their potential, shows that our Democratic League has not done a good job in the past few years and has not been able to play its due role well under the leadership of the Party. This is something that all the responsible comrades of the Democratic League, including myself, should deeply examine. Today, I would like to represent the responsible comrades of our Democratic League to call on all members of the Democratic League, especially all senior intellectuals among the members, to make redoubled efforts and play a leading role in the great call for "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," and wholeheartedly assist the Party and the government in completing the glorious task of socialist construction!

    我对高级知识分子问题的了解和意见
    ——森林工业部长罗隆基的发言
    今天我不谈森林工业有关的问题。
    今天我愿意就国家目前高级知识分子问题谈谈我个人的了解和意见。
    人民代表大会代表同政协委员在旧年冬季曾经联合视察过知识分子的情况，特别是高级知识分子问题，并且总共写了将近六十万字的书面报告。我在政协全国委员会常委会的工作岗位上同十几位委员和教授担负了研究全部书面报告的工作。各位代表当然还记得，在旧年视察的时候，高级知识分子问题是相当复杂的，问题牵涉的方面是很广的。我们从书面报告中，就整理出来了390多个项目。一个项目可能只是一两个高级知识分子的有关问题，可能是几个学术单位的问题，亦可能是某个区域甚至全国所有高级学术机关，所有全国高级知识分子共同的问题。现在政协常委会已把经过整理的材料分别转送给大约三十个与问题有关的中央主管部门，协商处理办法。我们希望对每个项目都能够了解真象，并且能够逐步得到适当的解决。我们相信，只要国家机关和国家工作人员认真地切实地执行党和政府对高级知识分子问题的政策，高级知识分子问题是能够逐步得到解决的。
    在解决高级知识分子
        问题上的成绩
    什么是党和政府对高级知识分子问题的政策？周恩来总理今年一月间曾经发表过两篇重要的报告，一篇是“关于知识分子问题的报告”，一篇是在政协第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议中的“政治报告”，关于团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，周总理在两篇报告中都提出了这样三项原则：（一）改善对知识分子的使用和安排；（二）对知识分子给以应有的信任和支持；（三）给知识分子以必要的工作条件和适当待遇。同时周总理对知识分子亦指示“采取自我教育的方法，通过社会生活的观察和实践，业务的实践和马克思列宁主义理论的学习这样三个互相联系的途径，逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子”这个政策是正确的，是切合实际的，亦是全国知识分子所热烈拥护的。
    现在我们来检查一下贯彻这个政策的实际情况。今天我们可以肯定地说，党和政府的各级组织，四个多月来，在解决高级知识分子问题上做了许多具体工作，有了很显著的成绩。举几个具体的例子来说，旧年高级知识分子普遍叫喊的，而且比较严重的问题是时间不够的问题，是时间上太忙太乱的问题。自从政府提出了保证六分之五的业务工作日以后，依据我个人了解，北京的教授和科学家们大约有四分之三以上的人数已经初步地解决了时间问题。一般地说来，北京的大学和高等学校，大都采取了或正在设法采用有效的措施，减少教授和科学家们用在非业务性会议和行政事务上的时间。为了解决图书资料缺乏问题，许多单位对原有图书正在进行整理，并且在可能和必要的范围内正在订购新的图书资料。在配备助手方面，有些单位已经解决了人员编制上的一些问题，力求增补一些人员。许多单位在可能的条件下正在进行合理的调整工资。我想在座的各位代表都已经知道，最近国务院改革工资的决定实施以后，对知识分子，特别对科学技术工作者们的工资都将有较多的提高。四个多月来，领导党已经吸收了大批高级知识分子入党，这是旧知识分子最光荣的前途。这就大大地鼓舞了党外高级知识分子对自己的信心，对工作的积极性。
    党与非党的关系问题
    照这样说来，高级知识分子问题是不是已经全部解决了呢？我们今天还不能过早地做这样的结论。拿代表委员们最近一次视察关于这方面的材料同旧年第二次视察的材料比照起来，高级知识分子中有些问题还是依然存在着。当然，有些问题因为客观条件的困难，还不是立时可以解决的。我今天不谈这一类的问题。但亦有些问题，因为高级知识分子和某些国家工作人员双方的主观努力不够，而没有得到解决。今天我要特别提出来谈的是团结问题，主要的是党与非党的关系问题，是周总理在报告中所指的一部分知识分子同党员之间“还存在着某种隔膜”这样一个问题。对这样一个问题，我们今天敞开来谈，是有好处的。
    极大多数的知识分子诚心诚意接受党的领导，诚心诚意拥护政府，这点是必须肯定的。但这不等于说某些知识分子同党员之间都完全没有了隔膜。党和政府的政策是明确的。但有些知识分子和少数党员对政策体会得不够，执行得不好，亦是不可隐讳的事实。这里有几点值得我们注意：第一，依据最近一次视察的一小部分材料，党和政府政策的贯彻程度，似乎有些地区因距离首都北京比较远些，对政策的了解比较少些，而贯彻的程度亦比较差些。最近视察某个地区的材料中有这样突出的一个例子：有个别的人认为改善高级知识分子的生活待遇和工作条件是“打天下的不坐，坐天下的不打”。这尽管是个别人的错误见解，但说明仍有人对周总理的两篇报告还没有好好学习过，对党一贯重视知识分子的政策，对党的统战政策还缺乏认识。这种错误见解，不止不能消除这种隔膜，必定会加强隔膜。第二，一部分高级知识分子与党员间的隔膜，责任是在双方，但周总理指示党员“必须主动地努力消除这种隔膜”，我以为这是高明的指示。根据最近视察报告的材料，有些党员在这方面的主动努力还有不够的地方。就拿“有职有权”这个问题来说，由于个别党员一方面勇于任事，敢于负责的过分热情，他却忽视了职权的界线，这就引起了他方面“有职无权”尸位素餐的敏感。有了这种敏感的人，又不以主人翁态度，展开批评，争取合作，共同完成职责，这亦是错误的。这类事情还在继续造成不必要的隔膜。第三，几年来，三反、五反、肃反和思想改造运动，毫无疑问，基本上提高了知识分子的思想，加强了对知识分子的团结。但过去运动中偶尔发生了某些偏差亦增加了一部分旧知识分子的戒慎恐惧。甚至有的高级知识分子由于对党的政策认识不清，体会不够，竟把党员个人的偏差，当成党的政策，他于是顾虑种种，忧闷重重，对人、对事，少说话，不说话，怕说话，一方面既然是“三缄其口”，他方面就敬而远之，这又不可避免地保存了隔膜。由于这种种隔膜的存在，今天有些高级知识分子的潜力就还没有充分地发挥，这亦是个事实。
  充分发挥高级知识分子的
                  潜力
    怎样来消除隔膜，进一步地加强团结，充分地发挥现有的高级知识分子的潜力，这是国家目前一个关键性的问题。我认为毛泽东主席“百家争鸣”的号召是扫除党与非党间的隔膜、加强团结的对症良方。
  “百家争鸣”可以发生这样两个好的作用：一方面教育一些党员和我们党派、团体、机关的负责人，让别人说话，听别人说话，容忍别人说话，尊重别人言论自由的权利；另一方面，鼓励另外一些消极沉默的高级知识分子，肯说话，多说话，大胆说话，珍视自己言论自由的权利。
    中国现有的十万个高级知识分子，极大部分是旧社会中长成的知识分子，他学术上的造诣越高，他的旧知识的根底就越深。在这样天翻地复的一个社会主义思想改造的潮流中，某一些旧的高级知识分子发生了某些顾虑，这是不可避免的现象。他们有政治上的顾虑，怕戴帽子，怕犯政治错误，怕受批评打击。他们有业务上的顾虑，旧知识不合时宜；新理论没有头绪。脑中空虚；心里徬徨。这种现象是不正常的，更是不健康的。但事实毕竟是事实。这种事实的改善，当然一方面要靠知识分子加强对马列主义的学习，提高自己的思想。但另一方面我们各方面负责团结改造知识分子的国家工作人员亦要面对现实，实事求是，帮助这样的知识分子来解决这些问题。
  实现“百家争鸣”，消除顾虑
    在我个人看来，我以为毛泽东主席号召的“百家争鸣”真正展开以后，就必然会解除旧的高级知识分子的政治顾虑和业务顾虑。中共中央宣传部陆定一部长在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的报告中这样说过：
  “我们所主张的‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’是提倡在文学艺术工作和科学研究工作中有独立思考的自由，有辩论的自由，有创作和批评的自由，有发表自己的意见、坚持自己的意见和保留自己的意见的自由”。今天有了这些自由的保证，高级知识分子还有什么顾虑吗？全国一切高级知识分子就应该把所有的知识尽量地贡献出来。中国有句老话：“知者千虑，必有一失，愚者千虑，必有一得”，一得之愚，一点一滴的知识，就是贡献。中国的旧知识分子，几年来经过党的教育培养，一般是提高了的，在批判和整理旧学术方面，今天是可以有贡献的。就科学来说，批判唯心主义者的学术并没有必要根本否定牛顿的“静者恒静、动者恒动”的一条规律，亦没有必要全部抹杀爱因斯坦“相对论”的发现。这里，旧科学家就可能作出许多有益的贡献。国家机关和国家工作人员固然不应该低估今天知识分子的进步，同时，旧知识分子亦不必过分低估自己以往的工作和成绩，
  “妄自菲薄”。“不怕不识货、只怕货比货。”只要知识分子们把所有的思想货物，全盘托出，通过自由讨论、自由辩论、自由批评、自由竞争比赛，就得出了高低、好坏、取舍的结果了。旧知识分子通过这样实际的竞争比赛，就得到了学习马列主义的机会，就进一步地提高了自己，改造了自己了！这样，宗派主义，教条主义，八股文章，当然亦就会被淘汰被清除了！
  关于“百家争鸣”实现方法
              的问题
    从最近一次视察反映中，我们知道全国高级知识分子是热烈拥护“百家争鸣”这个号召的，都认为这是对知识分子，特别对高级知识分子发挥积极性和创造性的一个极大的鼓舞。不过对“百家争鸣”实现的方法对怎样能够开展“百家争鸣”还有某些怀疑。
    有人认为一定要经过长期钻研、真正成“家”，是“百家争鸣”的起码应该具备的认识。我以为这种条件未免求之过严，提之太早。今天国家迫切的问题是怎样鼓励和推动知识分子起来“鸣”，起来“争鸣”不是怎样防止知识分子的“肯鸣”、“多鸣”、甚至一些“乱鸣”。谁人是“家”？谁人非“家”？我们固不能承认“鸣”就是“家”，倘真要“鸣者必家，非家莫鸣”，倘真要首先确定这样“家”的标准，这必定造成百鸣争“家”，而不是“百家争鸣”。结果在文学艺术和科学研究工作上可能又要使现在的宗派主义，教条主义垄断把持，使原来畏缩不前的旧知识分子丧气；使青年的新生力量受到排挤和压迫。
    有人认为“百家争鸣”是春秋战国动乱时代的产物，在一个有组织，有领导，有纪律的社会主义国家是不可能开展“百家争鸣”的。我认为这是错误的看法。春秋战国动乱时期的“百家争鸣”同社会主义时代的“百家争鸣”，个人主义时代的
  “百家争鸣”同集体主义时代的“百家争鸣”在本质上是不同的。动乱时期的“百家争鸣”是各为其主，各自成家，正如汉书上所说的“各引一端、崇其所好、以此驰说、取合诸侯”的争鸣。儒家说：“杨子为我，是无君也；墨子兼爱，是无父也；无父无君，是禽兽也”。这样你骂我是畜生，我骂你是禽兽的争鸣，这样彼此敌视，彼此仇恨的争鸣，在当时固然起过各放光彩的作用，但毕竟是水火不容，得到相灭而不相生的后果。社会主义集体主义时代的
  “百家争鸣”是人民内部的争鸣，是大家有共同目标，有共同方向，有共同前途的争鸣，是彼此互助合作的争鸣。拿音乐来作譬喻，在散漫动乱的时代，在个人主义时代，各敲各的锣，各打各的鼓，锣鼓喧天，音调杂乱，这样的“百家争鸣”，人民得不到音乐很大的好处的。社会主义，集体主义时代的“百家争鸣”，如同一个伟大的管弦乐队。乐队中弹琴的，吹笛的，敲锣的，打鼓的，在乐器上各有专长，在技术上各显神通，而这些音乐家的技术专长是相辅而行，相得益彰的。乐队的艺术水准是同各个队员的艺术发展相结合的。它鼓励队员各就所长精研艺术，它绝对不会埋没任何队员的音乐天才。乐队表演方式，有单人的独奏，有双人的二重奏，有四人的四重奏，也有整体的交响曲的演奏。它要演奏人民要听的，人民喜欢听的各种各样的乐谱，而音乐家自己亦可以编制各种各样的乐谱，使音乐家各尽所能，各展其才。但乐队的目的是为人民服务的，乐队队员每个人的目的亦必须是为人民服务的。这样，乐队在为听众演奏的时候就必须有组织、有领导、有指挥，而后演奏出来才有和声，有节奏。这样的“百家争鸣”才是今天人民需要的，才是适合今天的时代的。这是集体主义社会主义时代“百家争鸣”同动乱时期春秋战国时代的“百家争鸣”不同的地方。
    在视察材料中，有人认为“百家争鸣”以宪法为范围，这又约束限制了言论。我以为倘有人希望在“百家争鸣”中，可以违反宪法，可以违反爱国主义立场，可以敌我不分，这是荒谬的思想。我们必须认识，人民民主国家的宪法是人民自己制定的法律，每个人都有遵守的义务。宪法是人民自卫的武器，不是政府压迫人民的工具。我们必须记到，宪法第八十七条规定公民有言论出版的自由，“国家供给必需的物质上的便利，以保证公民享受这些自由”。宪法第九十五条规定公民有进行科学研究、文学艺术创作和其他文化活动的自由，“国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助。”这就是“百家争鸣”的法律根据。毛泽东主席“百家争鸣”的号召正是国家最高领导人履行宪法上的职责。同时有了这样的宪法，“百家争鸣”就真有了法律上的保障。这样，全国现有的高级知识分子，就能各凭本事，各显神通，欢欣鼓舞，踊跃争先，大胆地“鸣”起来，大胆地“争”起来了！
  加倍努力，在“百家争鸣”
        中起带头作用
    最后，我要谈一点我们中国民主同盟在高级知识分子问题中的任务。高级知识分子中某些问题没有能够及时地得到解决，特别高级知识分子还没有充分地发挥潜力，这说明我们民盟几年来没有做好工作，没有能够在党的领导下很好地发挥应有的作用，这是民盟的一切负责人，包括我自己在内，应该深自检讨的。今天我愿意代表我们民盟的负责同志，号召民盟的全体盟员，特别是盟员中全体高级知识分子，加倍努力，在“百家争鸣”的伟大号召中，起带头作用，全心全意地协助党和政府，完成社会主义建设事业的光荣任务！
