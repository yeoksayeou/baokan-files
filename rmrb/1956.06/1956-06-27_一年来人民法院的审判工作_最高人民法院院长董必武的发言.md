I fully agree with the State Council's proposed 1955 national final accounts, the 1956 national budget, and the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. In the short ten months since the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, our socialist transformation in agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory, and a tremendous surge has appeared in all aspects of national economic construction. I believe that after the Congress approves the 1956 national budget and passes the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, it will promote the greater development of our socialist construction on a solid and reliable foundation, and our country's first Five-Year Economic Plan will certainly be completed ahead of schedule and above quota.

    The Number of Cases Accepted by People's Courts at All Levels Shows a Downward Trend

Over the past year, the tremendous changes and developments in China's politics and economy have been reflected to some extent in the trial work of the people's courts. Last year, the number of cases accepted by people's courts at all levels across the country showed a downward trend overall. According to statistics from the vast majority of people's courts across the country: in 1955, the number of first-instance criminal and civil cases accepted by local people's courts at all levels decreased by 4% to 5% compared with 1954. Among all types of cases, disputes over land, mountains, and water conservancy decreased by more than 50%, economic crimes by unlawful capitalists decreased by more than 60%, disputes between public and private decreased by more than 30%, and various types of cases such as debt, marriage, and inheritance also tended to decrease. With the increasing consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, the increasing progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the increasing stability of social order, and the increasing organizational level and awareness of the people, some types of cases, such as land disputes, marriage and family disputes, theft, and counter-revolutionary cases, will inevitably decrease day by day.

The machinations of counter-revolutionary elements always become more active during periods of relatively rapid social change. In the first half of last year, our country was on the eve of the high tide of the socialist revolution, and the socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce was about to enter a crucial stage. Remaining counter-revolutionary elements thought they had an opportunity, and their sabotage activities became more rampant again for a time. Remaining counter-revolutionary elements, targeting various measures of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, fabricated rumors, incited people's hearts, and even committed arson, murder, and organized riots. Remaining counter-revolutionary elements also took advantage of gaps in our work and infiltrated state organs, troops, and enterprises to carry out secret harmful and destructive activities. In order to protect the people's lives and property and ensure the smooth progress of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is necessary to adopt a firm attitude and give the remaining counter-revolutionary elements another deserved blow.

At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, many representatives' speeches and proposals called for severely punishing remaining counter-revolutionary elements. The Congress also stipulated in the resolution on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy: "State organs at all levels and the people of the whole country must fully raise revolutionary vigilance, eliminate all open and hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and smash the destructive activities of domestic and foreign enemies against our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation." From the perspective of the trial work of the people's courts, I believe that the Second Session's resolution on eliminating counter-revolutionary elements and the representatives' speeches and proposals on this issue are fully in line with the actual situation at the time and the universal aspirations of the people of the whole country. The struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements carried out throughout the country last year was completely correct and necessary.

Our people's courts' trial work is mainly aimed at counter-revolutionaries, and we have gained some experience.

    Handling Counter-Revolutionary Cases in Accordance with the Policy of Combining Suppression and Leniency

First, regarding the issue of people's courts implementing the state's relevant policies, laws, and decrees on dealing with counter-revolutionary elements. As everyone knows, our country's policy towards counter-revolutionary elements has always been a policy of combining suppression and leniency. People's courts handle counter-revolutionary cases in accordance with this policy. People's courts, for counter-revolutionary elements who should be punished according to law, except for a very small number of counter-revolutionary elements who have committed heinous crimes, are incorrigible, seriously endanger the interests of the state and the people, and are extremely unpopular with the people, have been sentenced to death in accordance with the law. The vast majority of the rest have been sentenced to imprisonment and subjected to labor reform. This is because the vast majority of counter-revolutionary elements can be reformed, and we also have the strength to reform them. The result of doing so is that the vast majority of counter-revolutionary elements can be saved, so that they can be thoroughly reformed in labor to become self-reliant and new people who are useful to society.

Regarding the application of the death penalty, our country has always adopted a very cautious approach. In this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, the number of counter-revolutionary elements sentenced to death by people's courts in accordance with the law is still very small. Our country's scope of applying the death penalty to criminals is reduced as much as possible. As everyone knows, as early as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in 1951, we implemented the policy of "sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve, forced labor, to see the effect" for some counter-revolutionary elements who deserved the death penalty, but whose crimes had not yet caused the most serious damage to the interests of the state. The result of implementing this policy is that many counter-revolutionary elements with capital crimes have actually been pardoned.

Now, the application of the death penalty is not only reduced in scope, but the state has also stipulated it very strictly in law. Article 11, Paragraph 5 of the People's Courts Organization Law guarantees the serious and cautious application of the death penalty through the death penalty review procedure.

In this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, people's courts have given lenient treatment in accordance with the law to counter-revolutionary elements who have genuinely repented, surrendered themselves, and confessed their crimes, and many of them have also been sentenced to exemption from criminal punishment in accordance with the law. The people welcome all counter-revolutionary elements who are willing to repent and start anew, and the state's treatment of them is lenient. Now, as fundamental changes have taken place in our country's political situation, further differentiation and disintegration have also occurred within the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. This change in the remaining counter-revolutionary forces has become even more obvious after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China announced the Draft National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967). Article 5 of this program (draft) points out a path for counter-revolutionary elements to abandon darkness and turn to light, and to start anew. Many people among counter-revolutionary elements have begun to realize that the path of counter-revolution is becoming narrower and narrower, and have begun to understand that they should combine their fate with the brilliant future of our people. More and more are coming forward to surrender and confess their crimes. Therefore, it is necessary and possible for us to adopt a more lenient spirit in dealing with counter-revolutionary elements than in the past. That is to say, except for those resolute counter-revolutionary elements who have current sabotage activities or serious crimes in history, are extremely unpopular with the people, and refuse to confess, they still need to be severely punished in accordance with the law. For all those who confess their crimes and repent, regardless of whether they have serious historical crimes or current counter-revolutionary activities, they will all be given lenient treatment in accordance with the law: those whose crimes are very serious and should be sentenced to severe punishment in accordance with the law may be exempted from severe punishment; those who confess their crimes and repent and have meritorious service, such as reporting other counter-revolutionary elements, which has been verified to be true, can offset their crimes with meritorious service; if they assist the government in solving important counter-revolutionary cases and capturing important counter-revolutionary elements, it will be considered a great meritorious service. Such people can not only offset their crimes with meritorious service, but also be given appropriate rewards according to the specific circumstances. This clearly points out two paths for all counter-revolutionary elements: either choose the path of confessing their crimes, repenting, and starting anew, the result of which is to receive lenient treatment from the people's government; or choose the path of refusing to repent and continuing to be enemies of the people, the result of which is to be punished by the law. We hope that those counter-revolutionary elements who have not yet repented will make a decisive decision, think for themselves and their children, and quickly choose the bright path of abandoning darkness and turning to light, and starting anew, seek the forgiveness of the people, and work together with the people to make beneficial contributions to the construction of the motherland.

    Earnestly Implementing the State's Legal System is One of the Most Important Guarantees for Correctly Trying Cases

Second, regarding the issue of people's courts implementing the legal system in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. The promulgation and implementation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the People's Courts Organization Law have put forward the requirement of strictly abiding by the state's legal system to the people's courts. People's courts earnestly implementing the state's legal system is one of the most important guarantees for correctly trying cases.

In this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, people's courts at all levels have more strictly implemented the legal procedures for the division of labor between trial, investigation, and prosecution, and have given play to the active role of mutual cooperation and mutual restraint between people's courts and public security and procuratorial organs. The counter-revolutionary cases accepted by the people's courts are all prosecuted by the people's procuratorates. The people's courts conduct a review before opening the trial of counter-revolutionary cases prosecuted by the people's procuratorates: those with clear facts and complete evidence materials are accepted; those with clear main facts and sufficient evidence, but unclear minor facts, are accepted and the people's procuratorates are required to investigate and supplement the materials; those with unclear main facts and insufficient evidence are returned to the people's procuratorates for supplementary investigation; those who cannot constitute a crime are ruled to reject the prosecution or the people's procuratorates withdraw the prosecution. At the same time, if the people's procuratorates find that the people's courts have made inappropriate or wrong judgments, they also raise protests to the people's courts in accordance with the appeal procedure and the trial supervision procedure. If the people's courts find that there are indeed errors after retrial or retrial, they will change the judgment. In 1955, among all criminal cases prosecuted by people's procuratorates at all levels across the country to people's courts, about 3% of the cases were ruled by the people's courts to be not handed over for trial or returned for supplementary investigation, or were acquitted by the people's courts. According to materials from 14 provinces and cities including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Shanghai, Beijing, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, among the cases in which the procuratorial organs protested against the court's judgments in accordance with the appeal procedure and the trial supervision procedure in 1955, more than 80% have been corrected by the people's courts through revised judgments.

In the trial work of this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, people's courts at all levels have followed the trial procedures stipulated by the Constitution and the People's Courts Organization Law. The trial systems stipulated in the People's Courts Organization Law, such as open trial, jury, collegial panel, defense, and recusal, have become the usual systems for people's courts at all levels to try criminal cases; the entire trial process from reviewing the prosecution, opening the trial, collegial panel to sentencing is carried out under the supervision of the masses and with the defendant's right to defense. Criminal cases (including counter-revolutionary cases) undergo investigation by public security organs, approval of arrest, investigation, and prosecution by people's procuratorates before being tried in the people's courts, and then undergo investigation and research in the people's courts to clarify the facts and analyze the case, and are only sentenced after debate. Appeals are allowed after sentencing; the law also stipulates trial supervision procedures and death penalty review procedures; in this way, it is guaranteed that the people's courts will make no or few mistakes in handling cases.

Although the procedures are more complicated when handling matters in accordance with the statutory procedures and systems, the people's courts handle cases relatively promptly, and there are generally no backlogged cases. According to statistics on first-instance counter-revolutionary cases and other criminal cases in people's courts at all levels across the country in the second half of 1955, the receipt and conclusion of cases have approached equilibrium, and the number of concluded cases accounts for more than 95% of the number of received cases. In February of this year, from the materials of people's courts in many regions across the country, it has basically been achieved that the receipt and conclusion of cases are balanced.

    The Important Role of the Trial Work Supervision System

Third, regarding the issue of trial supervision. In this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, people's courts at all levels have greatly strengthened the supervision of trial work. This supervision of trial work, from the perspective of the people's court system, is manifested in the supervision of the trial work of the court by the presidents of the people's courts at all levels, the supervision of the trial work of people's courts at all levels across the country by the Supreme People's Court, and the supervision of the trial work of lower-level people's courts by higher-level people's courts. The trial work supervision system stipulated in the People's Courts Organization Law is of extremely important significance for ensuring that cases are handled properly, or for discovering and correcting wrongly judged cases in a timely manner. Among the counter-revolutionary cases of appeal and protest tried by higher and intermediate people's courts in various regions across the country in the first quarter of this year, no less than 40% were sent back for retrial, more than 20% were changed to reduced sentences, and about 3% were changed to acquittal.

In addition to exercising supervision over lower-level people's courts in accordance with the trial supervision procedure, higher-level people's courts also widely adopt the method of randomly checking cases and summarizing experiences, using the summarized experience to guide the trial work of lower-level people's courts; at the same time, in the randomly checked cases, if wrongly judged cases are found, they are also changed in accordance with legal procedures in a timely manner. In November 1955, the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court randomly checked the counter-revolutionary cases and other criminal cases judged by the grassroots people's courts in Zhengding, Zhuoxian, and other places, and after research, made a summary of experience. The people's courts at all levels in the province referred to this summary and checked the counter-revolutionary cases and other criminal cases that had been judged, and legally changed the wrongly judged cases that were found. This not only discovered and corrected errors in a timely manner, but also improved the policy and ideological level and legal and scientific knowledge of the trial staff, which has a positive effect on further improving the quality of case handling.

The trial work of the people's courts is also subject to supervision from the broad masses of the people. Several years ago, people's courts at all levels established the work of handling people's letters and receiving people's visits. This is an important aspect of the mass line of our trial work. In this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, the people actively assisted the people's courts in verifying evidence facts, and also put forward opinions on some cases that were judged improperly, which made it possible for the people's courts to avoid and reduce the occurrence of wrong cases to a greater extent.

    The Achievements in Trial Work are the Main Aspect, but There are Still Many Shortcomings and Errors

The people's courts at all levels have played a certain role in the victory of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, and the trial work has also achieved certain results, which is the main aspect. On the other hand, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our trial work. The main ones are that some people's courts have problems with excessively lenient or excessively severe sentencing when handling counter-revolutionary cases. Some also hastily conclude cases without fully verifying the facts of the crime, and even individual wrong cases occur. At the same time, some people's courts do not divide labor with public security and procuratorial organs according to their responsibilities. Some people's courts do not earnestly implement the trial system, and even restrict and deprive the defendant of the right to defense and appeal. The main reasons for these shortcomings and errors are that since the second half of last year, the country's political situation has developed rapidly, and the ideological understanding of some trial personnel has not kept up with the development of the objective situation. When handling cases, they are not good at implementing the state's policies and mastering the boundaries of leniency and strictness in accordance with the law in light of changes in the country's political situation. At the same time, some trial personnel do not earnestly implement the trial system stipulated in the People's Courts Organization Law, which also affects the quality of case handling. In addition, the state's laws are not yet very complete, and some judicial systems (such as the lawyer system) have not yet been universally established, which also brings certain difficulties to trial work. Although the shortcomings and errors that occurred in the trial work of some people's courts during this period are local and individual, the adverse consequences they cause cannot be ignored. The Supreme People's Court, together with the Ministry of Justice, has successively sent working groups to some provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to inspect the trial work of local people's courts; since November last year, it has conducted a more systematic study and summary of the trial work experience of people's courts at all levels across the country in this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. This summary was discussed and adopted at the Third National Judicial Work Conference held in February of this year. The Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice have ordered people's courts at all levels to conduct an inspection and summary of the counter-revolutionary cases that have been tried and concluded since the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. Although we have taken these measures, on the whole, our work has not been done deeply enough and timely enough, so the Supreme People's Court is responsible for these shortcomings that occurred in the work of some people's courts. Now, people's courts in various places are conducting inspection and summary work in accordance with the spirit of the Third National Judicial Work Conference, and are legally changing the wrongly judged cases that have been found. Before the Third Session of the National People's Congress, many representatives had inspected the work of the people's courts in various places, and had gained some understanding of this situation and put forward valuable opinions. We will seriously study them to improve the work of the courts. I would like to express my gratitude here!

    The Current Tasks of the People's Courts

Fellow representatives! The 1956 national budget that our Congress is about to approve and the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives that are about to be passed are signs that our country is taking a big step towards socialism. Our people will strive with unlimited enthusiasm and perseverance to achieve this goal. Our people will unite even better and work more happily. Our people are full of confidence in building their own beautiful and happy lives and in building a socialist motherland.

Now, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have obviously been greatly weakened, and will continue to be weakened, but this does not mean that the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been completely eliminated. In fact, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces still exist, and the struggle still has its complexity and acuteness. Therefore, it is still an important task for the people's courts to continue to maintain vigilance, use their trial functions, and punish the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements in accordance with the law, which is one aspect. On the other hand, in order to ensure the smooth progress of our country's socialist construction and protect the rights and legitimate interests of citizens, the people's courts must continue to work hard to fight against all illegal and criminal acts that hinder socialist construction; at the same time, due to the great victory of our country's socialist revolution, the relations of production are rapidly changing in cities and rural areas, and many new changes have occurred in the relations between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and industry and agriculture. With this change, some new disputes and litigations will inevitably arise. The people's courts must adjust the legal relations between them through trial activities to benefit production and unity. This is another important task of the people's courts at present. The key to completing the above tasks lies in strengthening the construction of the legal system, improving the quality of trial work, and ensuring the proper handling of cases, so as to adapt to the increasingly vigorous development needs of socialist construction. All cadres of our people's courts should make redoubled efforts to do a good job in trial work. Here, I sincerely hope that the representatives will continue to strengthen criticism and supervision of the people's courts. I think the representatives will certainly meet my requirements.

    一年来人民法院的审判工作
    ——最高人民法院院长董必武的发言
    我完全同意国务院提出的1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算和高级农业生产合作社示范章程。从第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议到现在，只不过十个多月的时间，我国农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，已经取得了决定性的胜利，国家经济建设的各个方面出现了巨大的高涨。我相信大会批准1956年国家预算，通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程后，将会推动我国社会主义建设在稳固可靠的基础上更加发展，我国第一个五年经济计划一定能够提前和超额完成。各级人民法院受理案件
  的数目有下降的趋势
    一年来，我国政治、经济上的巨大变化和发展，在人民法院的审判工作上也有某种程度的反映。去年全国各级人民法院受理案件的数目，总的来看有下降的趋势。根据全国绝大多数地区人民法院的材料统计：1955年地方各级人民法院受理的第一审刑事、民事案件，同1954年比较下降了4％到5％。在各类案件中，如土地、山林、水利纠纷案件下降50％以上，不法资本家经济犯罪案件下降60％以上，公私纠纷案件下降30％以上，债务、婚姻、继承等各类案件也趋于下降。随着人民民主专政的日益巩固，社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的日益进展，社会秩序的日益安定，人民群众的组织程度和觉悟程度的日益提高，有些类型的案件，定会减少的，如土地纠纷案件、婚姻、家庭纠纷案件、偷窃案件、反革命案件，是一定会日趋减少的。
    反革命分子的蠢动，总是在我们社会变革比较急剧的时期就更加活跃。去年上半年我国正处在社会主义革命高潮的前夜，我国农业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造正要进入紧要关头，残余反革命分子以为有机可乘，他们的破坏活动又一度比较猖狂起来了。残余反革命分子针对我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的各项措施，制造谣言，煽惑人心，甚至纵火、凶杀、组织暴乱。残余反革命分子还利用我们工作上的空隙，钻入国家机关、部队、企业内部进行暗害破坏活动。为了保护人民的生命财产，保障我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，就必须采取坚决的态度，再给残余反革命分子一次应有的打击。
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，很多代表的发言和提案，都要求严惩残余反革命分子。大会还在关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划的决议中，规定了：“各级国家机关和全国人民必须充分地提高革命的警惕性，肃清一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子，粉碎国内国外敌人对我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的破坏活动”。从人民法院的审判工作这个角度来看，我认为第二次会议有关肃清反革命分子的决议和代表们关于这个问题的发言和提案，是完全符合当时的实际情况和全国人民的普遍愿望的。去年在全国范围内开展的肃清反革命分子的斗争，是完全正确和必要的。
    我们人民法院的审判工作，主要的锋芒也是针对着反革命，我们已取得了一些经验。按照镇压与宽大相结合的政策处理反革命案件
    首先，关于人民法院执行国家有关处理反革命分子的政策、法律、法令的问题。大家知道，我们国家对反革命分子的政策，从来就是镇压与宽大相结合的政策。人民法院就是按照这个政策处理反革命案件的。人民法院对于依法应该惩处的反革命分子，除其中极少数罪大恶极、怙恶不悛、严重危害国家、人民利益和民愤很大的反革命分子依法判处了死刑外，其余绝大多数判处了徒刑，实行劳动改造。这是因为反革命分子中的绝大多数是可以改造的，而且我们也有力量改造他们。这样做的结果，就可以把绝大多数反革命分子挽救过来，使他们在劳动中彻底改造成为自食其力，成为对社会有用的新人。
    关于死刑的适用，我们国家历来就是采取十分慎重的方针。在这次肃清反革命分子斗争中，人民法院依法判处死刑的反革命分子仍是极少数。我们国家对罪犯适用死刑的范围是尽可能缩小的。大家知道，早在1951年镇压反革命运动时期，我们就对某些罪该处死、但其罪行对国家利益的损害尚未达到最严重程度的反革命分子，实行了“判处死刑、缓期两年、强迫劳动、以观后效”的政策。这个政策执行的结果，实际上已使得许多负有死罪的反革命分子获得了宽赦。
    现在，死刑的适用不仅在范围上缩小，而且，国家还从法律上规定得很严格。人民法院组织法第十一条第五款规定的死刑复核程序，保证了对死刑严肃、慎重的适用。
    在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，人民法院对于真诚悔过、自首坦白的反革命分子依法给予了宽大处理，对其中许多人还依法判决免予刑事处分。人民对于一切愿意悔过自新的反革命分子是欢迎的，国家对于他们的处理是宽大的。现在，随着我国政治形势发生了根本变化，反革命残余势力内部也就出现了进一步分化瓦解的现象。反革命残余势力发生的这种变化，在中共中央关于一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布以后，就更加明显了。这个纲要（草案）第五条的规定给反革命分子指出了一条弃暗投明、重新做人的道路。反革命分子中间的许多人，已经开始认识到反革命的路越走越窄了，开始懂得把自己的命运和我们全国人民的辉煌前途结合起来考虑了，越来越多地出来投案自首了。因此，我们对反革命分子的处理，已有必要和可能比较过去一个时候，采取更为宽大的精神。这就是说，除了那些有现行破坏活动或是历史上有严重罪行、民愤很大而又拒不坦白的坚决反革命分子，仍然需要依法严惩以外，对于一切坦白悔罪的分子，不论他们是有严重的历史罪恶或者有现行的反革命活动，都一律依法给以宽大处理：凡是罪恶很重依法应该判处重刑的，可以免处重刑；凡是坦白悔罪而又有立功表现的，譬如检举了其他反革命分子，经过查证属实，就可以将功折罪；如果协助政府破获了重要的反革命案件，捕获了重要的反革命分子，就算立了大功，对这种人不但可以将功折罪，而且可以根据具体情况给以适当的奖励。这就十分明显地给一切反革命分子指出了两条道路：或者是选择坦白悔罪、重新做人的道路，其结果是受到人民政府的宽大处理；或者是选择拒不悔改、继续与人民为敌的道路，其结果是受到国法的制裁。我们希望那些到现在还没有悔悟过来的反革命分子，能够当机立断，为自己，也为自己的子女着想，迅速地选择弃暗投明、重新做人的光明道路，求得人民的宽恕，和全国人民一道，共同为建设祖国作出有益的贡献。
    认真执行国家的法律制度是正确审判案件
    最重要的保证之一
    其次，关于人民法院在肃清反革命分子斗争中执行法律制度的问题。中华人民共和国宪法、人民法院组织法的公布施行，向人民法院提出了严格遵守国家法制的要求。人民法院认真地执行国家的法律制度，是正确审判案件最重要的保证之一。
    在这次肃清反革命分子斗争中，各级人民法院比较严格地执行了审判和侦查、起诉分工的法律程序，发挥了人民法院和人民公安、检察机关互相配合而又互相制约的积极作用。人民法院所受理的反革命案件，都是经人民检察院起诉的。对人民检察院提起公诉的反革命案件，人民法院在开庭前进行审查：对案情清楚、证据材料完备的，即予受理；主要情节清楚、证据充分，而次要情节不清的，受理后要求人民检察院查明、补充材料；主要情节不清、证据不足的，退回人民检察院补充侦查；不能构成犯罪的，就作出驳回起诉的裁定或者由人民检察院撤回起诉。同时，人民检察院发现人民法院判处不当或错判案件，也按照上诉程序和审判监督程序向人民法院提出抗议，人民法院经提审或再审后如发现确有错误便进行改判。一九五五年全国各级人民检察院向人民法院起诉的全部刑事案件中，经过人民法院裁定不交付审判或发还补充侦查，或经人民法院宣判无罪的案件约有百分之三。另据河北、山东、山西、湖北、湖南、广东、浙江、黑龙江、陕西、甘肃、江西、四川、上海、北京等十四个省、市和新疆维吾尔自治区的材料，一九五五年内检察机关按照上诉程序和审判监督程序对法院判决提出抗议的案件，其中有百分之八十以上已由人民法院改判纠正。
    在这次肃清反革命分子斗争的审判工作中，各级人民法院都是遵照宪法和人民法院组织法所规定的审理程序进行的。人民法院组织法所规定的公开审理、陪审、合议、辩护、回避等项审判制度，已成为各级人民法院审理刑事案件的通常制度；从审查起诉、开庭审理、合议到宣判的全部审判过程，是在群众监督和被告人获得辩护的情况下进行的。刑事案件（包括反革命案件）在人民法院审理前经过公安机关的侦查、人民检察院的批准逮捕、侦查、起诉，在人民法院再经过调查研究，弄清事实分析案情，并经过辩论，才进行判决，判决后准许上诉；法律还规定了审判监督程序和死刑复核程序；这样，就保证了人民法院办案不错或少错。
    照法定的程序和制度办事，手续虽较繁复，但人民法院办案还比较及时，一般没有积案。根据一九五五年下半年全国各级人民法院第一审反革命案件和其他刑事案件的统计，案件的收结已接近平衡，结案数字占收案的95％以上。今年二月份，我们从全国许多地区人民法院材料中看，基本上已作到案件收结平衡。
    审判工作监督制度
    的重要作用
    第三，关于审判监督问题。在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，各级人民法院大大加强了对审判工作的监督活动。这种对审判工作的监督活动，就人民法院系统来说，表现在各级人民法院院长对本院审判工作的监督、最高人民法院对全国各级人民法院审判工作的监督和上级人民法院对下级人民法院审判工作的监督。人民法院组织法规定的审判工作监督制度，对于保证办案妥当，或者及时发现和纠正错判案件，有着极为重要的意义。全国各地区高级和中级人民法院今年第一季度审理的上诉、抗议的反革命案件中，发回更审的不下于40％，改判减刑的在20％以上，改判无罪的占3％左右。
    上级人民法院除了依照审判监督程序对下级人民法院实行监督以外，还相当广泛地采用了抽查案件总结经验的办法，以总结的经验来指导下级人民法院的审判工作；同时，在抽查的案件中，如发现有错判的案件也及时按照法律程序进行改判。河北省高级人民法院在一九五五年十一月，抽查了正定、涿县等基层人民法院判决的反革命案件和其他刑事案件，经过研究，作出经验总结。该省各级人民法院参考这个总结，对已经判决的反革命案件和其他刑事案件，进行了检查，把查出来的错判案件，依法进行了改判。这样作，不仅及时地发现和纠正了错误，而且提高了审判工作人员的政策思想水平和法律科学知识，对进一步提高办案质量，有着积极的作用。
    人民法院的审判工作还受到来自广大人民群众的监督。在几年以前，各级人民法院就建立了处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作。这是我们审判工作群众路线的一个重要的方面。在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，人民群众积极地协助人民法院核对证据事实，还对某些判处不当的案件提出意见，这就使人民法院有可能在更大的程度上，避免和减少错案的发生。
    审判工作成绩是主要的，但是还有许多缺点和错误
    各级人民法院对肃清反革命分子斗争的胜利，曾经起了一定的作用，审判工作也取得了一定的成绩，这是主要的方面。另一方面，我们的审判工作还存在有许多缺点和错误，主要的是某些人民法院处理反革命案件，在量刑上有畸轻畸重的毛病，也有的对犯罪事实没有完全查对清楚就草率结案，甚至还有个别的错判案件；同时，有的人民法院没有和公安、检察机关按职责分工，有的人民法院没有切实执行审判制度，甚至限制和剥夺被告人的辩护、上诉权利。产生这些缺点和错误的主要原因是，从去年下半年以来，国家的政治形势发展很快，有些审判人员的思想认识跟不上客观形势的发展，他们在处理案件的时候，还不善于依据国家政治形势的变化来贯彻执行国家的政策，掌握依法从宽和依法从严的界限。同时，某些审判人员执行人民法院组织法规定的审判制度，不够认真，也影响了办案的质量。加以国家的法律还不很完备，某些司法制度（例如律师制度）还没有来得及普遍建立起来，也给审判工作带来一定的困难。某些人民法院在这个时期的审判工作中所发生的缺点和错误，尽管是局部的、个别的，但是它所引起的不良后果是不容忽视的。最高人民法院曾会同司法部陆续派出工作组到部分省、市、自治区检查当地人民法院的审判工作；从去年十一月起，对全国各级人民法院在这次肃清反革命分子斗争中的审判工作经验，作了比较系统的研究和总结。这个总结是在今年二月召开的第三届全国司法工作会议上讨论和通过的。最高人民法院和司法部已责成各级人民法院把肃清反革命分子斗争以来审理终结的反革命案件进行一次检查和总结。我们虽然采取了这些措施，但总的来说，我们的工作是作得不够深透，不够及时的，因此对某些人民法院在工作中发生的这些缺点，最高人民法院是负有责任的。现在各地人民法院正在依照第三届全国司法工作会议的精神，进行检查、总结工作，对检查出来的错判案件，正依法进行改判。全国人民代表大会第三次会议以前，不少的代表曾经到各地视察了人民法院的工作，对这方面的情况已经有所了解，并提出了宝贵的意见，我们当郑重地加以研究来改进法院的工作。我在这里谨致感谢！人民法院的当前任务
    各位代表！我们大会即将批准的1956年国家预算和即将通过的高级农业生产合作社示范章程，是我国更向社会主义迈进一大步的标志。我国人民将以无限的热情和毅力为达到这一标志而奋斗。我国人民将团结得更好，劳动生产得更愉快。我国人民对建设自己美好幸福的生活和对建设社会主义的祖国充满了信心。
    现在，反革命残余势力显然已经极大地削弱了，而且还会继续地削弱下去，但是这并不等于反革命残余势力已经彻底地被肃清了。事实上，反革命残余势力仍然存在，斗争仍有它的复杂性和尖锐性。因之，人民法院继续保持警惕，运用审判职能，依法惩治反革命分子的破坏活动，仍然是一个重要任务，这是一方面。另一方面，人民法院为了保障我国社会主义建设的顺利进行，保护公民的权利和合法利益，还必须继续努力同一切阻碍社会主义建设的违法和犯罪的行为进行斗争；同时由于我国社会主义革命的伟大胜利，在城市和农村，生产关系正在迅速地变革，在工农关系，城乡关系和工农业之间的关系上出现了不少的新的变化，随着这种变化，也必然会出现一些新的纠纷和讼争，人民法院必须通过审判活动，调整它们之间的法律关系，以利于生产和团结。这是人民法院当前另一个重要的任务。完成上述任务的关键在于加强法制建设，提高审判工作质量，保证办案的妥当，以适应社会主义建设日益蓬勃发展的需要。我们人民法院的全体干部，自应加倍努力，作好审判工作。在这里我诚恳地希望各位代表继续加强对人民法院的批评和监督，我想各位代表一定会满足我的要求的。
