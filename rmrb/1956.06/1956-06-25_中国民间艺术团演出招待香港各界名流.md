Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 24th. More than 1,300 well-known industrialists, businessmen, bankers, and prominent figures from all walks of life in Hong Kong were invited to appreciate the performance of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe on the evening of the 23rd.

The Chinese Folk Art Troupe's performance included Tan Fuying's "Empty City Stratagem," Qiu Shengrong's "Stealing the Imperial Horse," as well as folk dances such as the "Lotus Dance" and "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance," and solo performances by famous singers Zhou Xiaoyan and Huang Hong. These programs were warmly welcomed by the audience. After each program, the audience applauded thunderously, and some programs were even requested to be performed again.

Li Wenqi, a prominent figure in Hong Kong's business community, most appreciated the "Lion Dance." He said that without superb acting skills and cultivation, it would not be easy to make the lion appear as if it were alive. Harvey, a music critic for the English-language newspaper "Hong Kong Tiger Standard," said: "The performance of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe, whether in terms of scenery, makeup, color, tone, or the cultivation of the actors, has reached the realm of perfection. From this performance, we can see that New China has made significant progress in cultural and artistic aspects in recent years."

At the end of the reception performance, all members of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe, led by the head of the troupe, Ouyang Shan, took to the stage to thank the audience and received flowers from Hong Kong film actors and twelve children.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 23rd. The performance of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe has caused a sensation throughout Hong Kong. In recent days, the ticket office of the Reception Committee for the Art Troupe has been receiving telephone calls all day long from Kowloon, the "New Territories" suburbs, and outlying islands requesting to book tickets. Some Macao compatriots even traveled to Hong Kong by ship to wait to buy tickets. Tickets for the 21st to 23rd were quickly sold out.

In recent days, many Hong Kong newspapers have been publishing reports on the grand occasion of the Art Troupe's performances, with some newspapers using large-character headlines to praise the achievements of the motherland's artists.

    中国民间艺术团演出招待香港各界名流
    新华社香港24日电　二十三日晚上，香港一千三百多位知名的工商业家、银行家和各界名流被招待欣赏了中国民间艺术团的演出。
    中国民间艺术团这一场演出了谭富英的“空城计”、裘盛戎的“盗御马”，以及“荷花舞”、“采茶扑蝶舞”等民间舞蹈和著名歌唱家周小燕、黄虹的独唱等节目。这些节目都受到观众的热烈欢迎，每个节目表演完毕后，全场掌声雷动，有些节目还被要求再次表演。
    香港商界名流李文祺最欣赏“狮子舞”。他说，如果没有精湛的演技和修养，决不容易把狮子演来像活的一样。香港一家英文报纸“香港虎报”的音乐评论员哈威说：“中国民间艺术团的演出，无论布景、化妆、色调、音调、演员修养，都达到至善至美的境界，从这次演出可以看到，新中国这几年来在文化艺术方面有了长足的进步”。
    招待演出结束的时候，以团长欧阳山为首的中国民间艺术团全体团员登台向观众道谢，并且接受了香港电影演员和十二个儿童的献花。
    据新华社香港23日电　中国民间艺术团的演出轰动了整个香港。连天来，接待艺术团委员会的票务部整天都在接听从九龙“新界”郊区和离岛挂来要求订票的电话。有些澳门同胞还乘坐轮船赶来香港等候购票。二十一至二十三日的票很快就订购一空。
    连日来，香港许多报纸都在刊载艺术团演出的盛况，有些报纸用大字标题赞扬祖国艺术家们的成就。
