    Lanzhou, June 5th (By Our Newspaper) - The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has crossed the Beida River Bridge west of Jiuquan, and tracks were laid to Jiayuguan, the end point of the Great Wall, on the afternoon of the 5th.
    Jiayuguan is more than 30 kilometers away from Jiuquan City. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has been an important gateway to the western regions. The Ming Dynasty connected the Great Wall with Jiayuguan. In the past, the area outside the pass was extremely desolate. People described it as: "Once you leave Jiayuguan, your eyes will never dry from tears. Looking ahead, it's the Gobi Desert; looking back, it's the Gate of Hell." After liberation, with the rapid development of the motherland's construction, the area outside Jiayuguan is no longer as desolate as it used to be. People have changed the original poem to: "Once you leave Jiayuguan, your eyes can't see through. Looking ahead, it's the big oil field; looking back, it's the new railway line."

    兰新铁路铺轨到嘉峪关
    本报兰州5日电　兰新铁路已经跨过了酒泉之西的北大河大桥，在五日下午铺轨到万里长城的终点嘉峪关。
    嘉峪关距离酒泉城三十多公里，从汉唐以来，它是通往西部地区的重要关口；明朝曾把长城和嘉峪关连接起来。过去关外异常荒凉，人们形容说：“出了嘉峪关，两眼泪不干，往前看，戈壁滩，往后看，鬼门关。”解放以后，随着祖国建设事业的飞跃发展，嘉峪关外已不是昔日那样荒凉了。人们把原来那首诗改成了这样：“出了嘉峪关，两眼望不穿，往前看，大油田，往后看，是新线。”
