Comrades,

It has been 11 months since the closing of the 2nd session last July. In these 11 months, our country has undergone unprecedented and enormous changes. The socialist transformation movement reached an unprecedented climax at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Now, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts has been basically completed nationwide, and the task of agricultural production cooperation has also been basically completed. Advanced cooperatives of a completely socialist nature have become the main organizational form of agricultural production. During this period, the Party Central Committee also put forward the historically significant and grand draft agricultural development program, pointing out long-term goals for agricultural development. Following this, it issued a call to intellectuals nationwide to advance towards science and strive to bring China's most urgently needed scientific departments close to the world's advanced scientific levels within a not-too-long period. Under these wise measures, our socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory and is advancing by leaps and bounds.

The development of the new situation has created more favorable conditions for the people's health cause. Over the past year, the health cause has made great progress, and at the same time, it has also put forward new tasks for the people's health cause.

During this period, in order to make its work more conducive to the socialist construction cause, the Ministry of Health convened a national health work conference in February this year, at which the basic tasks of the health cause for 1956 were determined, and a preliminary plan for the twelve-year development vision was drafted.

First, let me talk about the issue of eliminating several diseases that seriously endanger people's health. In the first five-year plan, health agencies were tasked with "preventing diseases that seriously harm the people and promoting and protecting the people's health." The draft national agricultural development program further clearly pointed out that starting from 1956, the most serious diseases endangering the people should be basically eliminated in all possible places within seven or twelve years. Without a doubt, schistosomiasis is the most important one, both in terms of the widespread epidemic areas, the large number of infected people, and the severity of the harm to patients' health. At the 2nd session last year, there were three proposals on the prevention and eradication of schistosomiasis. Therefore, preventing and treating schistosomiasis is the key focus of our work to eliminate serious diseases that endanger the people. This work has received the greatest care from the Party. Last November, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, a nine-member team for the elimination of schistosomiasis was established, and the first national conference on schistosomiasis prevention and treatment was held in Shanghai, making comprehensive arrangements. After the meeting, provinces and cities, according to the central instructions and the spirit of the meeting, convened meetings on prevention and treatment work, or people's representative meetings and Chinese and Western medicine representative meetings in the epidemic areas, etc. Through these meetings, they unified their thinking, improved their understanding, and strengthened their confidence. Prevention and treatment committees have been established in people's committees at all levels in the epidemic areas to specifically grasp the planning and implementation of prevention and treatment work. The determined work steps are one year of preparation, four years of combat, and two years of finalization, roughly seven years to basically complete the arduous historical task of eliminating schistosomiasis. Now, all provinces in the epidemic areas are conducting surveys, training cadres, organizing research, and designating pilot projects to gain experience and prepare for combat. Many experts and professors, under the call of the Party, have spared no effort to delve into the epidemic areas to specifically guide the pilot work, combining science and technology with mass movements. This is not only conducive to doing a good job in the pilot work, but also enriches the content of scientific research work. In order to check the work situation in various places, the 2nd prevention and treatment conference was held in Shanghai in March this year, proving that great achievements have been made in the work in recent months. Whether in eliminating snails, managing feces to eliminate worm eggs, or in treatment, the masses have many new creations. For example, in eliminating snails, many areas have taken advantage of the opportunity of winter and spring to combine with water conservancy construction, mobilize the masses, and launch large-scale shock snail eradication campaigns. In Anhui Province alone, 1.5 million people were organized, using more than 20 million workdays. According to incomplete statistics, the snail elimination area in nine provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, is approximately 243,937,435 square meters. In the process of snail elimination, the masses created many effective soil burial methods, such as the ditch center soil burial method, the displacement soil burial method, the opening of new ditches and filling of old ditches method, etc. Hubei, Jiangsu and other lake areas use the fire burning method, and some areas in Anhui use tea seed cake and other drugs to kill snails. In the management of feces and elimination of worm eggs, it is combined with the rural production fertilizer accumulation movement. According to incomplete statistics from Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces, 938,320 fecal tanks have been centralized, 1,366 townships in Jiangsu and 153,473 households in Anhui have managed their feces well, and can maintain it regularly. It shows that the management of feces not only increases the quantity and effectiveness of manure, but also prevents schistosomiasis, eliminates flies, and improves environmental hygiene. There are constant new discoveries and creations in treatment and prevention methods. In Western medicine treatment, research and experiments have been carried out to shorten the course of treatment, and preliminary results have been achieved in shortening the treatment time. At the same time, further methods have been found to reduce patient reactions, such as the method of using potassium antimony tartrate mixed with glucose, etc. In addition, sodium antimony tartrate is being tested and other new drugs are being actively researched. Particularly worth mentioning are the discoveries of many traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods. Up to now, more than 400 kinds of prescriptions and compound prescriptions for the treatment of schistosomiasis have been discovered, of which 27 have been clinically proven to have good curative effects, once again proving that the medical effects of our country's medicine are remarkable, and the experience in fighting diseases is extraordinarily rich. It can be imagined that in the struggle to eliminate schistosomiasis, traditional Chinese medicine will play an even greater role.

However, there are still many shortcomings in this work: some areas do not have a sufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of this work, resulting in undue impatience or a sense of underestimation; there is not much complete experience on how to combine prevention and treatment work with production so that it does not hinder production and is beneficial to production; although both Chinese and Western medicine have some effective experiences in treatment, the summary and promotion are not rapid and timely enough, and the propaganda and education to mobilize the masses and mobilize more medical personnel to participate in this struggle is still very poor; scientific research work in this area is far from meeting the requirements of prevention and treatment work. These shortcomings must be overcome urgently.

Schistosomiasis is a serious problem involving agricultural production and the health of the vast majority of people. I ask everyone to strictly supervise this work and criticize our shortcomings and errors in our work.

Plague is also one of the diseases that has long endangered people's health. After several years of active prevention and treatment after liberation, the incidence and number of deaths in the past two years are the lowest in some eras with numerical records since China had the plague. Compared with various diseases, it is also the lowest in incidence and mortality in the past two years. However, we cannot draw the blindly optimistic conclusion that the plague is no longer important. We must regard these insignificant minority cases as a thin crack on the Yellow River dike. If it is not fundamentally eliminated, it can cause a devastating flood. In order to eradicate this historical disaster, the Ministry of Health convened a national plague prevention and treatment conference in March this year. The conference formulated a plan based on the principle of comprehensive prevention and treatment, and decided to basically eliminate the plague and various factors that cause the plague within seven years. Judging from the experience of several years of prevention and treatment, although there are various practical difficulties, it is still possible to do it.

Malaria is a more widespread disease than schistosomiasis. Due to geographical factors, there is no province or region in our country that does not have malaria. The number of people who get sick every year is very large. Although its damage to the human body and possible consequences are not as serious as schistosomiasis, the health and economic losses it causes are still significant. There is some experience in malaria prevention and treatment that can be used, especially the experience of the Soviet Union in this area can give us great help. The current problem lies in how to implement it in conjunction with China's existing conditions. Now, with the help of Soviet experts, we are conducting experimental research on the elimination of malaria in Hainan Island to prepare conditions for the full-scale elimination of malaria.

Secondly, I would like to talk about the work of traditional Chinese medicine. In the past, the Ministry of Health had made serious mistakes in this regard. Over the past year, through ideological criticism, the health department's understanding of traditional Chinese medicine has been initially reversed. The focus was on summarizing the experiences of traditional Chinese medicine in treating Japanese encephalitis B, qigong in treating gastric and duodenal ulcers, as well as schistosomiasis, hemorrhoids, leprosy and venereal diseases, and educating cadres with these practical examples, which has achieved great results. However, the key issue to inherit and carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine lies in Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine, because only Western medicine with modern natural science knowledge, understanding traditional Chinese medicine, can sort out the experience of traditional Chinese medicine to promote and enrich our new medicine. We believe that this is the central link of the work of traditional Chinese medicine, and we must firmly grasp this central link so as not to make mistakes again. In order to deploy and carry out the work of Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine, the Ministry of Health convened two symposiums of directors of departments and bureaus of northern and southern provinces and cities in Shanghai and Beijing in March and April, respectively, to arrange the work of Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine. The specific methods are divided into three forms: full-time study, on-the-job study, and general study. At the end of last year, the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine had transferred about 80 associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, hospital doctors and some graduates of higher medical schools to study full-time, and plans to transfer another 400 people this fall to open the second phase (concentrated in 6 places for classes). This year, about 5,000 Western medicine personnel are organized to study on-the-job; general studies are determined by local areas themselves. The work is progressing actively. In addition, it is planned to increase traditional Chinese medicine courses in higher medical colleges across the country in the next two years, so that the graduates in the future will be able to understand some basic knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine. Starting this year, it is planned to build a traditional Chinese medicine college in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Beijing, respectively, to train talents in researching traditional Chinese medicine. In order to strengthen the research work of traditional Chinese medicine, the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine was established and started work in December last year. As of now, public medical institutions across the country have absorbed more than 10,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in the work, established 67 traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, and more than 1,200 outpatient clinics.

However, there are still many shortcomings in our work on traditional Chinese medicine. Some restrictive rules and regulations that restrict and discriminate against traditional Chinese medicine have not completely disappeared in some medical departments; the clamor of opposing traditional Chinese medicine has disappeared, but ideological resistance still exists among some personnel. In addition, there are still many problems in the arrangement and education of traditional Chinese medicine and the research work of traditional Chinese medicine, which need to be solved with greater efforts.

Third, I would like to talk about the grassroots organization of health institutions. The grassroots health organization is an agency that directly serves the health of the people. This is an organization that should have medical care wherever there are people, because only when the grassroots organization is popularized can it effectively guarantee the right of workers to receive material assistance in times of illness as stipulated in our constitution. In recent years, the construction of our health organizations and the strength of health work have been popularized to the county and part of the district in rural areas. In the vast townships below the district, they are cooperative-based joint clinics, maternity stations organized by the people themselves, and private practitioners of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. With the development of the socialist transformation of the countryside, a large number of agricultural production cooperatives are constantly transforming into advanced cooperatives. On the one hand, the people more urgently need to solve the problem of diseases that hinder production, and on the other hand, the position of joint clinics and private practitioners in the socialist countryside needs to be arranged. This forces us to properly solve the problem of grassroots organizations in rural areas. Although many hospitals have been expanded and newly built in cities, with the development of industry, the urban working people are increasing day by day, and the existing medical equipment still cannot meet the needs of the people. To meet the health needs of urban and rural working people, it can only be solved by establishing grassroots health organizations. Judging from the situation in various aspects, a more reasonable and efficient organization and use of the existing strength of urban and rural joint clinics and private practitioners can greatly help solve the problem of grassroots health organizations. The health department previously had insufficient understanding of the importance of this issue. Currently, we are focusing our efforts on solving this problem.

In addition, there has been progress to varying degrees in the work of industrial hygiene, health in ethnic minority areas, maternal and child health, and medical education, but there are still many problems and shortcomings in our work; due to heavy tasks and insufficient strength, the medical work for diseases is far from meeting the needs of the people; the transformation and progress of the health department cannot adapt to the objective requirements; our health work is not doing enough to serve the masses in the implementation of policies and organization. For example, the ratio of our medical beds to sanatorium beds is four to one, and the proportion of sanatorium beds is too high, which is unreasonable, resulting in a waste of sanatorium beds, while medical beds are not enough, which should be corrected. For example, in the past, the scope of public medical care was too narrow, so that some cadres could not get the due treatment after they got sick; in the implementation of public medical care methods, medicine was free of charge, which sometimes led to waste; and among workers and their families and some cadres' families, the burden of medical expenses was too heavy, causing great difficulties. At the same time, the prices of general medicines and medical expenses are too high, so that some people cannot afford to see a doctor or take medicine when they get sick. For example, in the countryside, a sound grassroots health organization has not been well established to give full play to the strength of the vast number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and help them better serve the people. Regarding the above shortcomings and problems, we are cooperating with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Labor, and other relevant departments to study improvement and solutions. In addition, we must further implement the traditional Chinese medicine policy, continue to improve the work of traditional Chinese medicine with great efforts, and strengthen leadership and implement various basic measures for the vast number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and joint clinics organized by traditional Chinese and Western medicine. We have not paid enough attention to medical research work, and medical accidents still occur in some medical institutions; we lack more effective and convenient methods for certain diseases that seriously endanger the people, and have not been able to give full play to the enthusiasm of health organizations at all levels; there are still some phenomena of mechanically copying the Soviet Union's experience without starting from China's actual situation. In particular, in the deployment of our health work in recent years, we have concentrated too much, and managed too much that should not be managed. On the contrary, we have relaxed our leadership in the business of health work, and have not seriously managed it. We have not done enough to improve and train the ideological and professional level of the vast number of intermediate medical personnel, mainly nurses and rural medical workers. We have not done enough publicity on the issue of contraception, which is beneficial to the health of women and children, the upbringing of children, and the prosperity of the nation. In the future, we should further carry out publicity and education work and strengthen technical guidance work in conjunction with relevant units under the leadership of the Party and government.

Some of these problems and shortcomings have existed for a long time, some have been newly exposed in the work of the past year, and some have been overcome but have reoccurred, but no matter where they come from, they cannot be allowed to continue to exist for a long time. Tolerating the existence of these shortcomings will inevitably bring losses to the people's health cause. Here I must mention the so-called medical accidents that we all hate. Doctors can save lives, which is the characteristic of the noble meaning of their profession, but once a problem occurs, it is a matter of life and death, which is also the dark characteristic of this profession. Therefore, in our work, we are extremely opposed to accidents. We generally divide medical accidents into liability accidents and technical accidents, and deal with them according to their nature. Some places do not take active education work on weekdays, do not take preventive measures, and do not seriously deal with accidents when they occur, so accidents occur one after another; but in some places, improper handling, failure to analyze the nature of the accident, affects the confidence of doctors, hospitals irresponsibly "consult", shirk difficult cases for fear of causing trouble, and "peace medicine" is popular everywhere. Such bad phenomena also deserve our attention. Medical accidents with bad nature must be dealt with. In addition, we also require giving medical personnel spiritual encouragement and more actively giving them education and care.

In order to carry out experimental research in medicine and health science, we will continue to enrich research equipment, give medical and health science research work more suitable conditions for research work, and implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. We must both explore and sort out the rich and valuable medical heritage of the motherland, and also learn and absorb the advanced scientific achievements of the world, and carry out our research work on this basis, so that our medical science can approach or catch up with the world level within twelve years or a shorter period, and thereby improve the level of the people's health cause. I firmly believe that this goal can be achieved.

    卫生部长李德全的发言
    消灭危害人民健康最严重的几种疾病——继承和发扬祖国医学遗产的关键在于西医学习中医——必须更合理地使用现有的城乡联合诊所和私人开业医务人员的力量
    从去年7月第2次会议闭幕以后到现在，已有11个月了。在这11个月当中，我们的国家已经发生了有史以来所未有的巨大变化。从去年年底和今年年初全国社会主义改造运动达到了空前的高潮，现在全国资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造已经基本完成，农业生产合作化的任务也已经基本完成，完全社会主义性质的高级合作社已经成为农业生产的主要的组织形式。在这一期间，党中央又提出了具有历史意义的规模宏远的农业发展纲要草案，给农业发展指出了长期奋斗的目标。继之又向全国知识分子发出向科学进军，在一个不太长的时间内使我国最急需的科学部门接近世界科学先进水平而奋斗的号召。在这些英明的措施下我国的社会主义改造事业已取得了决定性胜利，正以一日千里之势大踏步地前进着。
    新形势的发展，给人民保健事业创造了更有利的条件，一年来卫生事业又有了很大的发展，同时，也给人民保健事业提出了新的任务。
    在这一期间，卫生部为使自己的工作更有助于社会主义的建设事业，在今年2月召开了全国卫生工作会议，在会议上确定了卫生事业1956年的基本任务，和初步地规划了十二年发展远景。
    首先让我来谈一谈消灭危害人民健康最严重的几种疾病的问题。在第一个五年计划里已给卫生机关规定了要“防止对人民危害严重的疾病，增进和保护人民的健康”的任务，在全国农业发展纲要草案中更明确指出从1956年开始，分别在七年或者十二年内，在一切可能的地方基本上消灭危害人民最严重的几种疾病。毫无疑问，无论从流行地区的广泛、感染人数的众多以及对患者健康摧残的严重看，其中最主要的是血吸虫病。在去年第2次会议里，就有三个关于防治和根绝血吸虫病的提案。所以防治血吸虫病是我们消灭严重危害人民疾病的重点工作。这一工作得到了党的最大的关怀。去年十一月在党中央的领导下成立了消灭血吸虫病的九人小组，并在上海召开了全国第一次防治血吸虫病会议，进行了全面的部署，会后各省市根据中央指示和会议的精神，大都召开了防治工作的会议，或者疫区人民代表会议和中西医代表会议等，通过这些会议统一了思想，提高了认识，坚定了信心。在疫区各级人民委员会都成立了防治委员会，以具体掌握防治工作的规划和进行。确定的工作步骤是一年准备，四年战斗，二年扫尾，大约七年的时间基本上完成消灭血吸虫病这个艰巨的历史任务。现在疫区各省均在进行摸清情况，训练干部，组织研究，指定试点，以便取得经验，为战斗作好准备。许多专家教授，均在党的号召下不辞劳瘁的深入疫区，具体的指导试点工作，使科学技术与群众运动相结合。这样既有利于搞好试点工作，同时也丰富了科学研究工作的内容。为了检查各地的工作情况，今年3月又在上海召开了第2次防治会议，证明了几个月来工作有很大的成绩。无论在消灭钉螺方面，管理粪便消灭虫卵方面，以及治疗方面，群众均有许多新的创造。比如在消灭钉螺方面，很多地区均利用去冬今春的时机结合兴修水利，发动群众，展开了大规模的突击灭螺运动，仅安徽一省，即组织150万人，用了2，000多万个工作日。据不完全的统计，江苏等九省市，灭螺面积约有243，937，435平方公尺。在进行灭螺工作中，群众创造出很多有效的土埋办法，如沟心土埋法，移位土埋法，开新沟填旧沟法等等，湖北、江苏等湖沼地区，则用火烧法，安徽有些地区则使用茶子饼等药物杀死钉螺。在管理粪便消灭虫卵方面，则结合着农村的生产积肥运动来进行。据江苏、江西两省的不完全的统计，就集中粪缸938，320只，江苏有1，366个乡，安徽有153，473户已管好粪便，并能保持经常。说明管理粪便，不仅增加粪肥的数量和肥效，同时也防止了血吸虫病，消灭了苍蝇，和搞好了环境卫生。在治疗和预防方法上，不断有新的发现和创造。在西医治疗上，已进行了缩短疗程的研究与实验，在缩短治疗时间上，已取得初步效果，同时在减轻病人反应方面也找出进一步的办法，如酒石酸锑钾与葡萄糖混合使用等办法，此外也正在试验酒石酸锑钠和积极的研究寻求其他新的药物。特别值得提出的是许多中医中药治疗方法的发现，到最近为止已发现了400多种治疗血吸虫病的单方、复方，其中有27种业经临床具有很好的疗效，再一次证明我国医学的医疗效果是卓越的，与疾病作斗争的经验是异常丰富的。可以设想，在消灭血吸虫病的斗争中，中医中药将发挥其更伟大的作用。
    但在这一工作中也还存在着不少缺点：有些地区对这一工作的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足，因而产生了不应有的急躁情绪或轻敌观念；防治工作如何结合生产进行，使无碍于生产并有利于生产的经验，还不多不全；治疗方面，虽然中西医都有些有效的经验，但总结和推广还不够迅速及时，发动群众和发动更多的医务人员参加这一斗争的宣传教育也还很差；这一方面的科学研究工作，也远不能赶上防治工作的要求。这些缺点都是急待克服的。
    血吸虫病是一个牵涉到农业生产和广大人民健康的严重问题，我要求大家严格地监督这一工作，并对于我们工作中的缺点和错误给予批评。
    鼠疫也是曾经长期危害人民健康的疾病之一，经过解放后几年的积极防治，最近两年的发病率和死亡人数，是从我国有鼠疫以来有数字记载一些年代中的最低的。和各种疾病比较起来，也是最近两年中发病最低和死亡最少的。但是我们不能由此就得出鼠疫已经是无关重要的那种盲目乐观的结论来，我们必须把这虽然是微不足道的少数病例，看成是黄河大堤上的一个纤细漏洞，如不根本消除，就可以酿成洪水横流的巨灾来。为根除这个历史性的灾害，今年三月卫生部召开了全国鼠疫防治会议，会议根据综合性防治的原则制定了规划，决定在七年内基本消灭鼠疫和发生鼠疫的各种因素。从几年防治的经验看来，虽有各种实际困难，还是可能办到的。
    疟疾是比血吸虫病更具有广泛性的疾病，由于地理的因素，我们全国没有一个省区没有疟疾存在，每年发病人数，是很大的，虽然它对于人体的摧残和可能发生的后果不及血吸虫病那样严重，但它所造成的健康方面和经济方面的损失依然是重大的。在防治疟疾方面有些经验可资利用，特别是苏联在这一方面的经验可以给我们很大的帮助，目前的问题在于如何结合我国现有条件来实行。现在在苏联专家帮助之下，我们已在海南岛进行消灭疟疾的实验研究工作，为全面展开消灭疟疾工作准备条件。
    其次，我想谈的是中医工作问题。过去卫生部在这方面曾经犯过严重的错误，一年来经过思想批判，初步扭转了卫生部门对于中医的认识。重点的总结了中医治疗乙型脑炎、气功治疗胃肠溃疡，以及血吸虫病、痔瘘、麻风和性病等经验，并以这些实际事例教育干部，收到了很大的效果。但是要继承和发扬祖国医学的遗产，关键问题还在于西医学习中医，因为只有具有现代自然科学知识的西医，懂得了中医，才能把中医的经验整理出来，以发扬与丰富我国新的医学。我们认为这是中医工作的中心环节，必须紧紧地抓着这一中心环节，才不致再犯错误。为部署开展西医学习中医的工作，卫生部曾于三月和四月在上海和北京先后召开了两次北方和南方各省市的厅局长座谈会，布置了西医学习中医的工作。具体办法分为脱产学习、在职学习、一般学习的3种形式。去年年底中医研究院已调各医学院副教授、讲师、助教、医院大夫以及部分高等医学院校的毕业学生约80余人脱产学习，并计划在本年秋季再调400人开设第二期（集中在6个地方上课），今年组织西医在职学习的约有5，000人；一般学习由各地自行确定。工作正在积极进行中。此外准备在今后两年内，全国高等医药院校开始增加中医课程，求得今后毕业的学生均能懂得一些中医的基本知识。从今年起拟在上海、广州、成都、北京四处各建一所中医学院，以培养研究中医的人才。为了加强中医的研究工作，成立中医研究院，已于去年12月开始工作。截至目前为止，全国公立医疗机构，吸收中医参加工作约一万余人，建立中医院67所，门诊部1，200多处。
    但我们的中医工作还有很多缺点的。一些限制中医、歧视中医的清规戒律，在某些医疗部门并未完全绝迹；大喊大叫地反对中医的声浪是没有了，但是思想上的抵触情绪在部分人员中也还继续存在着。此外关于中医的安排和教育以及中医中药的研究工作还存在着很多问题，还有待于下更大的力量来解决。
    第三，我想谈谈卫生机构的基层组织问题。卫生基层组织是直接为人民健康服务的机关，这是一种那里有人那里就应当有医的组织，因为只有基层组织普及了，才能有效地保证我们宪法上规定的劳动者在疾病时候获得物质帮助的权利。几年来，我们卫生组织的建设，和卫生工作的力量，在乡村除普及到县和一部分的区，在广大的区以下的乡，则是合作社性质的联合诊所，人民自己组织的接生站和私人开业的中西医。随着农村社会主义改造的发展，大批农业生产合作社不断向高级社转变，一方面人民对于妨碍生产的疾病问题更迫切需要解决，一方面联合诊所和开业医生在社会主义化的农村里，应摆在什么地位，也需要安排，这就迫使我们必须妥善解决乡村的基层组织问题。在城市虽然已扩建和新建了不少医院，但随着工业的发展，城市劳动人民日益增加，已有的医疗设备，仍然不能满足人民的要求。为满足城乡劳动人民保健的需要，必须也只有建立卫生基层组织才能解决。从各方面的情况看，更合理和更有效率的组织和使用现有的城乡联合诊所和私人开业医务人员的力量，就可以大大有助于卫生基层组织问题的解决。卫生部门对于这一问题的重要性以前是认识不足的，目前我们正在集中力量解决这一问题。
    此外，在工业卫生、少数民族地区卫生、妇幼卫生和医学教育等方面的工作也都有不同程度的进展，但在我们工作中存在的问题和缺点还很多；由于任务重力量不够因而对疾病的医疗工作还远不能满足人民的需要；卫生部门的改造进步还不能适应客观的要求；我们的卫生工作在执行政策上和组织上为群众服务作的还很不够，比如我们的医疗病床与疗养病床的比例为四比一，疗养病床所占的比例过高，这是不合理的，以致造成疗养病床的浪费，而医疗病床又不够用，这是应该加以纠正的。又如过去公费医疗中，享受公费医疗的面过窄，以致有些干部生病后还得不到应有的治疗；在实行公费治疗的办法中，又实行医药一律免费，有时形成浪费；而在工人和工人家属以及一部分干部家属中，又因医药费负担过重，造成很大的困难。同时一般的药品及医疗费用都收费过高，以致有些人得了病，看不起病，吃不起药。又如乡村中还没有很好地建立起健全的基层卫生组织，以充分发挥广大中医的力量，帮助他们更好地为人民服务。对于以上这些缺点和问题，我们正配合中华全国总工会、劳动部，以及其他有关部门研究改进和解决的方案。此外，我们对中医政策还必须进一步的贯彻，对中医工作要继续以大力改进，对广大中医和中西医组织起来的联合诊所急须加强领导和实行各项基本措施。我们对医学研究工作还没有很好的重视，有些医疗机构中医疗事故仍不断发生；对于严重危害人民的某些疾病还缺乏更有效更方便的办法，没有能很好地发挥各层卫生组织的积极性；学习苏联有的还有些生搬硬套现象，没有从我国的实际情况出发，特别是几年来我们在卫生工作的部署上，集中的太多，不应该管的，管的太多，真正在卫生工作的业务上，相反的，倒放松了领导，并未认真的管起来，对广大中级医务人员主要的是护士和农村医务工作人员思想业务水平的提高与培养都很不够。关于有利于妇婴的健康，子女的教养，民族的繁荣而实行的节育问题我们宣传不够，今后还应在党政领导下结合有关单位进一步的开展宣传教育工作和加强技术指导工作。
    这些问题和缺点，有的是早已存在的，有的是最近一年工作中新暴露出来的，也有一些是既经克服而又重新发生的，但不管它的来源怎样，都是不能任其长此继续存在的，容忍这些缺点存在，就必然会给人民保健事业带来损失。这里我必须提一下的是我们人人厌恶的所谓医疗事故。医生能救命，这是他职业的崇高意义的特点，但是一旦发生个毛病，就是人命攸关，这也是这个职业阴暗的特点。所以我们在工作中，极力反对发生事故。我们把医疗事故一般分为责任事故和技术事故，分别性质处理。有的地方平日不采取积极的教育工作，不作预防性的措施，事故发生又不认真的处理，因而事故层出不穷；但也有些地方，处理不当，不分析事故的性质，影响了医生的自信心，各医院不负责任的“会诊”，怕惹事的推诿疑难症，“和平药”到处流行。这样的不良现象也值得引起我们的注意。性质恶劣的医疗事故，必定要处理。另外我们也要求给医务人员以精神上的鼓励，更积极的给他们教育和关怀。
    为了开展医学和卫生科学的实验研究工作，我们将不断充实研究设备，给医学卫生科学研究工作以更适于研究工作的条件，并贯彻百花齐放百家争鸣的方针，我们既要发掘整理祖国丰富而宝贵的医学遗产，同时也要学习吸收世界先进的科学成果，并在这个基础上开展我们的研究工作，使我们的医药科学在十二年或更短的时期以内接近或赶上世界水平，并从而提高人民保健事业的水平。我深信这个目标是可以达到的。
