    Rapidly Improve Coal Quality
    Deputy Director of the Supply and Marketing Bureau, Ministry of Coal Industry An Zhenqing
    The problem of poor coal quality has persisted for several years. Although the former Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Ministry of Coal Industry have issued many instructions on improving coal quality, and newspapers have criticized it, there has been no thorough improvement to date. For example, in 1954, 75% of coal enterprises nationwide failed to meet their annual planned quality targets, with the ash content in coal exceeding the annual plan by 0.51%. In 1955, 65% of coal enterprises nationwide failed to meet their annual planned quality targets, with the ash content in coal exceeding the annual plan by 1.1%. In the first quarter of this year, the ash content in coal already exceeded the plan by 1.63%.
    Poor coal quality is also manifested in the large amount of gangue and debris mixed within the coal. For example, in one instance, the Fuxin Mining Bureau transported over 8,000 tons of raw coal to Shanghai. During unloading, 40 tons of lump coal were selected, from which 8.5 tons of stones were picked out. The largest piece weighed over 100 catties (approximately 50 kilograms). In March of this year, the Yangquan Mining Bureau's No. 4 mine transported over 200 tons of mixed coal (a mixture of coal fines and lump coal) to Suzhou. Upon unloading, it was discovered that there were too many stones. After screening, only about 500 kilograms of good lump coal were found in the screened-out ton of "lump coal," with the remainder being stones. No wonder the receiving unit said, "This is not picking stones from coal; it is picking coal from stones." Some coal contains debris such as wooden sticks, and some even contain detonators and explosives. In January of this year, when the Weishui Power Plant used coal from the Yangquan Mining Bureau, it discovered one detonator and four packets of explosives, along with a fuse. Fortunately, they were discovered early, otherwise, if put into the furnace, the consequences would have been unimaginable.
    Poor coal quality causes great losses to the country and the people. For example, for coke used in coking, if the ash content increases by 1%, an iron-smelting furnace will need to use 2% to 2.5% more coke, the consumption of limestone will increase by 4%, the capacity of the coking furnace will weaken, and the quality of the product will also be affected. In terms of transportation, if the quality of the coal used is poor, train delays are likely to occur. If the average ash content of raw coal nationwide increases by 1% this year, it would be equivalent to producing an extra 1.18 million tons of gangue and ash, wasting 413 million ton-kilometers of transportation capacity, and requiring more than 39,000 railcars.
    What are the reasons for the poor coal quality? The most important reason is that the leading personnel in coal production enterprises generally have a one-sided view of pursuing quantity while neglecting quality. Many coal mines only have measures to increase production, but no systems to ensure quality and no plans to implement such measures. Workers are only educated on increasing production, not on improving quality. When faced with poor quality, they always emphasize the difficulties in mining and sorting, without actively seeking ways to improve. Some enterprises even juxtapose increasing quantity against improving quality. For example, the director of the Yingcheng Coal Mine of the Jiaohe Mining Bureau did not implement the coal quality management system in order to promote the advanced experience of the one-shift coal mining system. A mine under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau simply filed away the instructions issued by higher authorities regarding improving coal quality after circulating them for review. When relevant departments approached the production section of the bureau to raise the issue of improving coal quality, the comrades in the production section said, "We can't even complete the production tasks now, so we can't worry about that." Even worse, some enterprises deliberately mix inferior coal with good coal in order to pursue output. Separate mining and separate transportation (separating good coal from gangue) is a necessary production process to improve coal quality. To implement separate mining and transportation, simple screening equipment is needed. The Ministry of Coal Industry's failure to promptly resolve the supply of such equipment is also a reason why coal quality has not improved.
    The phenomenon of poor coal quality must be changed. We must strive to improve coal quality in accordance with the central government's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." The workers of coal production enterprises should actively respond to the initiative to improve coal quality put forward by the National Conference of Advanced Coal Industry Producers' Representatives, and strictly implement the "Trial Regulations on the Management of Run-of-Mine Coal Quality at the Mine Mouth" promulgated by the Ministry of Coal Industry in 1955. Each production mine, especially those with historically poor coal quality, should conduct an inspection, identify the causes, and propose measures to improve coal quality. It is necessary to educate the workers to recognize the importance of improving coal quality for national construction and people's lives, promote advanced experiences in improving coal quality, and establish a mass quality inspection network. The People's Supervision Offices of each mine should also strengthen the inspection and supervision of coal quality. The supply of simple screening equipment must be guaranteed in the plans. As long as everyone acts together, attaches importance to this issue, and actively seeks solutions, the phenomenon of poor coal quality that has persisted for many years will gradually disappear.

### 迅速提高煤炭质量  煤炭工业部供销局副局长

    迅速提高煤炭质量
    煤炭工业部供销局副局长  安振卿
    煤炭质量低劣的问题，已经有好几年了。虽然前燃料工业部和煤炭工业部都曾作了不少关于提高煤炭质量的指示，报纸上批评过，但是至今仍没有彻底好转。如1954年全国有75％的煤炭企业没有完成年计划质量指标，煤炭中所含的灰分超过年计划的0.51％。1955年全国有65％的煤炭企业没有完成年计划质量指标，煤炭中所含灰分超过年计划1.1％。今年第一季度煤炭中所含灰分就已经超过计划1.63％。
    煤炭质量低劣，也表现在煤内夹有大量矸石和杂物上面。如阜新矿务局有一次运往上海的八千多吨原煤，在卸煤的时候拣出块煤四十吨，从中就挑出八吨半石头，最大的一块竟重一百多斤。阳泉矿务局四矿今年三月运到苏州的二百多吨混煤（煤末和块煤混在一起），卸车的时候发现石头太多，经过筛选，在筛出的一吨“块煤”中，好的块煤只有五百来公斤，剩下的都是石头，难怪收货单位说：“这不是从煤中拣石头，这是从石头中拣煤。”有的煤炭中夹有木棍等杂物，有的甚至含有雷管和炸药。微水发电厂今年一月份用阳泉矿务局的煤时，就发现了雷管一个，炸药四包，还附有导火线，幸而发现得早，否则投入炉内，后果是不堪设想的。
    煤炭质量低劣，给国家和人民造成的损失很大。像炼焦用的焦炭，如果灰分增加1％，一个化铁炉就要多用焦炭2％到2.5％，石灰岩消耗量就要增加4％，炼焦炉的能力就要减弱，产品质量也要受到影响。在交通运输方面，如果使用的煤炭质量不好，就容易发生火车晚点事故。假使今年全国原煤平均灰分增加1％，就等于多余地生产了118万吨矸石和灰，要浪费运输力四亿一千三百万吨公里，要用三万九千多辆车皮。
    是什么原因造成煤炭质量低劣呢？最主要的是煤炭生产企业部门的领导人员普遍有片面追求数量、忽视质量的观点。很多煤矿只有提高产量的措施，没有保证质量的制度和实现措施的计划。对职工只进行提高产量的教育，不进行提高质量的教育，对质量低劣的现象，总是强调开采困难和检选困难，不去积极想办法改进。有的企业甚至把提高数量和提高质量对立起来。如蛟河矿务局营城煤矿矿长为了推行一班采煤制的先进经验，竟不执行煤炭质量管理的制度。焦作矿务局有一个矿将上级发下的关于改进煤炭质量的指示，层层往下批阅，以后归档一锁了事。有关部门找这个局生产处提出改进煤炭质量问题，生产处的同志说：“现在产量任务完不成，顾不了这个。”更恶劣的是有的企业为了追求产量，竟把劣质煤故意掺到好煤中去。分采分运（把好煤和矸石分开）是提高煤炭质量必要的生产过程，要实行分采分运，就要有简单的筛选设备，煤炭工业部没有及时地解决这种设备的供应问题，也是煤炭质量没提高的一个原因。
    煤炭质量低劣的现象，必须改变。我们必须根据中央提出的“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针，努力提高煤炭质量。煤炭生产企业的职工们应该积极响应全国煤炭工业先进生产者代表会议提出的提高煤炭质量的倡议，严格执行1955年煤炭工业部颁布的“井口原煤质量管理试行规程”。各生产矿，特别是过去煤炭质量不好的生产矿，应该作一番检查，找出原因，提出改进煤炭质量的措施。要教育职工们认识提高煤炭质量对国家建设和人民生活的重要性，推广提高煤炭质量的先进经验，建立起群众性的质量检查网。各矿的人民监察室也要加强对煤炭质量的检查和监督。必须在计划里保证简单筛选设备的供应。只要大家一致行动起来，重视这个问题，积极想办法，多年来煤炭质量低劣的现象就会逐渐消灭。
