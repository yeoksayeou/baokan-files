    Sudan Dispatch: Ten Days in Khartoum
    By Our Correspondent Feng Zhidan
    Visiting Khartoum at this time is much better than it was a year ago. During these ten days, we were guests of the Sudanese government, and all those who received us were Sudanese. We Chinese are happy to see another independent national flag raised on the African continent. This flag flies over Khartoum, and it is a combination of blue, yellow, and green: blue symbolizing the Nile River, yellow symbolizing the desert, and green symbolizing the beautiful, fertile land.
    Khartoum is located on the upper reaches of the Nile. Khartoum, in Arabic, means "the body of an elephant," because the city protrudes into the Nile River like an elephant's trunk. The White Nile flows from Lake Victoria on the equator from south to north; the Blue Nile flows from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands from east to west. The Blue and White Nile converge in Khartoum, and from Khartoum, the main stream of the Nile flows, surging for more than six thousand kilometers, becoming the cradle of African civilization.
    Khartoum itself has a population of about 80,000. On the opposite bank of Khartoum is Omdurman, the old capital of Sudan, with a population of about 200,000. North of Khartoum is a "North Town" with a population of about 50,000. These three towns can be called one city, but when we mention Khartoum, we are referring to the city proper.
    Mr. Mansour, an official of the government of the Republic of Sudan, accompanied us on a tour of the city. Our car sped along the tree-lined boulevard along the Nile River, and the scenery was charming as we looked out of the car window. The car reached the northwest corner of Khartoum, where we got out of the car and strolled along the riverbank, reaching a place called "Al-Mogran" (meaning "the junction"), which is where the Blue and White Nile converge. We saw a clear line of water stretching for two kilometers: on one side, white, shimmering water, and on the other, a blue river. Reeds swayed in the breeze, water birds skimmed the surface, and a small boat gradually approached the line. I think there are many beautiful places in the world, but such a scene is rare. It is natural for the Sudanese to be proud of this.
    In Khartoum, two loathsome bronze statues still stand: one is of Kitchener, who pioneered British colonization of Africa in the nineteenth century and eventually became the first colonial governor-general of Sudan; the other is of Gordon, who helped the Qing Dynasty suppress the Taiping Rebellion in China in the 1860s and then ran to Sudan in the 1890s to carry out colonial conspiracies.
    These two statues of colonialists painfully remind the Sudanese people of the deep disasters that Western colonialists brought to this country. We drove across a large bridge over the Nile River to the east bank of the Nile, which is Omdurman, the old capital of Sudan, which faces Khartoum across the river. There, we saw the bloody historical relics of the colonial occupation of Khartoum in 1898. Along the banks of the Nile, there is a long row of earth fortresses piled up very solidly. Mansour told me that this was where the Sudanese bravely fought back when the British Kitchener led the invading army into Khartoum in 1898. At that time, the Sudanese showed extraordinary heroism, resisting the colonialists' guns with primitive weapons in their hands. More than 100,000 Sudanese fell heroically, their bodies strewn along the banks of the Nile. This is how colonialists cruelly pioneered African colonies. Next to the earth fortress stands a stone tablet inscribed with: "This is the fortress built during the Mahdist era (Sudanese Dynasty) to defend Omdurman."
    As we passed through a stretch of yellow sand behind the earth fortress, Mansour, who was accompanying us, said to me: "This is where our fathers shed their blood and fell. We will never forget." Next to the earth fortress is the residence of Sudanese King Khalifa, who led the resistance against the colonial army at that time, which has now been turned into a museum. There, I also saw a machine gun used by the colonial army to attack Khartoum. These historical relics aroused in me a deep respect for the Sudanese people and an infinite hatred for colonialism. For half a century, the Sudanese people have inherited the heroic traditions of their predecessors and have never ceased their struggle for national independence. After the Second World War, the vigorous development of the Sudanese national movement forced Britain to recognize the independence of Sudan. Because Sudan has just achieved independent status, one can still see many unfortunate traces left by colonialism in the newly born Republic of Sudan.
    When we arrived in the southern district of Khartoum, Mr. Mansour introduced it as Khartoum's "industrial zone." As the car passed, signs of American companies such as "Ford Motor Company Agency," "Coca-Cola," and "Pepsi-Cola" appeared. We also saw many British companies along the way.
    We were very happy to be able to visit a factory run by the Sudanese themselves—the Gaboura Plywood Factory. It makes furniture, but in reality, it looks more like a workshop. As soon as we entered the factory, we saw some wardrobes, sofas, tables, and chairs. The woodworking director, Mabrouk, accompanied us on the tour. He introduced that these furniture are made of wood shipped from Britain. In fact, Sudan does not lack wood. The woodworking director brought us a piece of Sudanese wood called "Boda," and he tried to knock on the wood and said: "Look, we Sudan has abundant wood resources, for example, we have precious wood like 'Mahogany'. But the British forced us to import wood and did not allow us to develop forestry."
    By chance, I walked into a "Sudan Tobacco Company." A Sudanese employee talked to me about the tobacco industry in Sudan. He told me that nominally this is the "Sudan Tobacco Company," but in essence, it is controlled by foreign capital. I took out a Zhonghua brand cigarette and offered it to him. He happily took the Chinese cigarette and stuffed an empty cigarette pack decorated with Tiananmen Square into his pocket as a souvenir. He said: "It's a pity that you can't buy Sudanese cigarettes in our country now. Under long-term colonial rule, we don't know how to make cigarettes, and there are no cigarette factories. There are three foreign cigarette companies in Khartoum that import about five to six million pounds of foreign cigarettes every year. But we are now starting to develop the tobacco industry. After a while, you will be able to smoke Sudanese cigarettes."
    Under colonial rule, the development of education in Sudan was out of the question. There are only a few secondary schools in the entire Sudan, with a population of more than 10 million. From the occupation of Sudan in 1898 until the 1930s, there was only one secondary school called "Gordon College," and it was not until 1951 that "Gordon College" was renamed Khartoum University. When the Sudanese Minister of Education, Rahman, received the leaders of our Chinese cultural and artistic delegation, he pointed to the map hanging on the wall of his office and said: "In such a vast land, we only have a handful of schools. After Sudan gains independence, we will try to fill the blank spaces on the map and establish schools in every corner." Needless to say, this wish is shared by all Sudanese people. The Sudanese people urgently need their own intellectuals to build their beautiful motherland.
    During this short ten-day visit, I cannot say that I have a deep understanding of Sudan. But at least, I can say that I have not only seen the beautiful land of Sudan but also the lovely people of Sudan. The people here are confidently fighting for the bright future of their motherland. The people here are full of friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. During our visit, a ten-member Sudanese delegation, including members of parliament, trade union workers, journalists, and doctors, had already set off for China for a friendly visit. Before the special plane carrying the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation left Sudan, many Sudanese rushed to Khartoum Airport to see them off. They were all ordinary Sudanese people. They held our hands tightly and said to us in Chinese: "Goodbye!"

    苏丹航讯喀土穆十日
    本报记者　冯之丹
    现在这个时候访问喀土穆是比较一年前到这里来要好得多了。我们在这十天中间是苏丹政府的客人，接待我们的都是苏丹人。我们中国人高兴地看到，在非洲大陆上又有一面独立的国旗升起来了。这面国旗飘扬在喀土穆的上空，它是蓝黄绿三色的结合：蓝色象征尼罗河，黄色象征沙漠，绿色象征美丽肥沃的土地。
    喀土穆位于尼罗河的上游。喀土穆，阿拉伯文的意思是“象的身躯”，因为这个城市突出在尼罗河滨，状似象躯。白尼罗河从赤道上的维多利亚湖由南向北流；青尼罗河从埃塞俄比亚高原上的塔那湖由东向西流，青白尼罗河汇合在喀土穆，自喀土穆而下，是尼罗河的正流，浩浩荡荡，迂回六千余公里，成为非洲文明的摇篮。
    喀土穆本身约有八万人口。喀土穆对岸是苏丹旧都恩图曼，约有二十余万人口。喀市北有一“北镇”约有五万人口。这三镇可以被称为一个城市，但当我们提到喀土穆时，这是指它的本市。
    苏丹共和国政府的一位官员曼苏尔先生陪同我们游览全市风光。我们的汽车沿尼罗河滨的林荫大道驰去，从车窗向外眺望，景色迷人。车至喀市的西北角，下车漫步河滨，走到一处名“麦轧隆”（即“连接”的意思）的地方，这里就是青白尼罗河的汇流处。只见有一条长达两公里的鲜明的水的界线：一边是白色的金光闪闪的水流，另一边是蓝色的河流。河上芦苇在微风中摇晃，水鸟掠过水面，一叶扁舟渐渐地驶近界线。我想，世界上有很多美丽的地方，但是这样的景色却是罕见的。苏丹人以此自豪，这是很自然的事情。
    在喀土穆，迄今还树立着两座令人憎恶的铜像：一座是十九世纪为英国开拓非洲殖民地，最后成为苏丹第一任殖民总督的契金纳铜像；另一座是曾在上一世纪的六十年代帮助清皇朝镇压中国太平天国农民起义，九十年代又跑到苏丹去进行殖民阴谋的戈登铜像。
    这两座殖民者的铜像，使苏丹人民痛心地回忆到西方殖民主义者所带给这个国家的深重的灾难。我们驱车驰过尼罗河上的一座大桥，到了尼罗河的东岸，这是和喀土穆隔岸相对的苏丹旧都恩图曼。在那里，我们看到了1898年殖民者占领喀土穆的血腥的历史遗迹。沿着尼罗河岸，有一个堆得很结实的一长列土堡垒。曼苏尔告诉我，这就是英国人契金纳在1898年率领侵略军攻入喀土穆时，苏丹人英勇地予以反击的地方。当时苏丹人表现了非凡的英雄气概，他们手里拿着原始的武器，去抵抗殖民者的枪炮。十余万苏丹人壮烈地倒下去了，尸体横遍尼罗河岸。殖民者就是这样残酷地去开拓非洲殖民地的。在土堡旁，树立着一块石碑，上面刻着：“此为麦罕地（苏丹皇朝）时代保卫恩图曼所建的堡垒。”
    当我们经过土堡后面的一片黄沙地时，陪同我们的曼苏尔向我说：“这就是我们的父亲流血倒下的地方。我们将永志不忘。”在土堡旁还保存着当时领导抗击殖民军的苏丹国王加里弗的住所，现在已经变成博物馆了。在那里，我还看到一挺殖民军进攻喀土穆时所用的机关枪。这些历史的陈迹，都引起我对苏丹人民的深切的敬意和对殖民主义的无限的仇恨。半个世纪以来，苏丹人民继承着他们上一辈的英勇传统，从未终止过争取民族独立的斗争。第二次世界大战以后，苏丹民族运动的蓬勃发展，迫使英国承认苏丹的独立。由于苏丹刚刚取得独立的地位，因此，人们仍然还可以在新生的苏丹共和国看到殖民主义遗留下来许多不幸的痕迹。
    当到达喀土穆的南区时，曼苏尔先生介绍说，这是喀市的“工业区”。汽车驰过之处，出现了“福特汽车公司代理行”“可口可乐”、“贝却可乐”等美国公司的招牌。沿路还见到不少英国公司。
    我们很高兴地能够参观一家苏丹人自己开办的工厂——贾伯拉帕米斯木工厂。它是制作家具的，实际上，倒像一个工场。一进厂门，就看见一些衣柜、沙发、桌椅。木工主任马勃拉克陪同我们参观。他介绍说，这些家具都是用英国运来的木材制作的。其实，苏丹并不缺乏木材。木工主任给我们拿来了一块名叫“菩达”的苏丹木材，他试着敲击这块木料，并说：“瞧，我们苏丹有很丰富的木材资源，例如我们有像‘马可果尼’这类的珍木。可是英国人强迫向我们输入木材，不让我们发展林业。”
    由于一个偶然的机会，我走进一家“苏丹烟草公司”。一个苏丹职员和我谈到苏丹的烟业。他告诉我，名义上这是“苏丹烟草公司”，但是实质上这是外国资本控制的。我拿出一支中华牌的香烟请他吸，他高兴地接过中国香烟，并且把一个装饰着天安门的空烟包塞进口袋里留作纪念。他说：“很可惜，现在你们到我们的国家来还吸不到苏丹烟。在长期的殖民统治下，我们不会制造烟，也没有烟厂。喀土穆有三家外国烟公司，每年约进口五、六百万镑的外国烟。但是我们现在正开始发展烟业，过些时候来，你们将能吸到苏丹烟了。”
    在殖民统治下，苏丹教育事业是谈不上发展的。全苏丹一千余万人口也只有寥寥几所中等学校。从1898年苏丹被占领起一直到本世纪的三十年代，只有一个名叫“戈登学院”的中等学校，直到1951年才把“戈登学院”改为喀土穆大学。苏丹教育部长拉哈门在接见我国文化艺术代表团的领导人员时曾指着办公室墙壁上挂着的地图说：“在这样辽阔的土地上，我们只有屈指可数的几所学校。在苏丹取得独立以后，我们将要设法填满地图上的空白，在每个角落建立学校。”不用说，这种愿望是全苏丹人民所共有的，苏丹人民急迫地需要自己的知识分子来建设自己美丽的祖国。
    在这短短的十天访问中，我绝不能够说，我已对苏丹有了很深的了解。但至少，我可以说，我不仅看到了苏丹美丽的土地，而且看到了苏丹可爱的人民。这里的人民正在满怀信心地为了自己祖国的美好的未来而斗争着。这里的人民充满着对中国人民友好的感情。在我们访问期间，苏丹一个包括国会议员、工会工作者、记者、医生的十人代表团，已启程到中国进行友好访问去了。在载送中国文化艺术代表团的专机离开苏丹以前，许多苏丹人赶到喀土穆机场来送行。他们都是苏丹的普通人，他们握着我们的手紧紧不放，他们用中国话向我们说：“再见！”（附图片）
