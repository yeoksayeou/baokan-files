    In a Youth Agricultural Experiment Station
    Wen Tianshen
    On the side of the highway from Shenyang to the southern suburbs, nestled among many poplar trees, in the beautiful environment of Chengnan Elementary School, a small, one-and-a-half mu youth agricultural experiment station was recently established. This farm was established by the school's Young Pioneers, with the help of teachers, in conjunction with the Small Five-Year Plan activities. The farm's director, chief technician, station chief, technicians, and accountant are all students themselves. The children have divided the farm into three sections: a flower and tree cultivation station, a crop cultivation station, and a livestock breeding station. With the support and help of the government, the school, and the Nantah Vegetable Production Cooperative, they have some means of production and improved seeds, as well as four goats and six rabbits. To enrich their agricultural production knowledge, the children frequently visited farmer uncles and learned from them the experience of cultivation and breeding even before the agricultural experiment station was established. From the day the farm was established, they hired Yang Jianhua, the vice chairman of the Nantah Vegetable Production Cooperative, with whom they had a deep friendship, as their technical advisor.
    Not long ago, I visited Chengnan Elementary School and their youth agricultural experiment station.
      "How are the children's activities combined with teaching?" When the principal talked about this issue, he opened a fourth-grade language textbook for junior primary school and said, "There are many lessons here about plant growth, seed germination, and how plants absorb water and nutrients, but in the past, the knowledge the children gained was only limited to the textbook." Now, through the activities of the experimental farm, the school's teachers guide the children in conjunction with teaching, so that the knowledge the children learn from the textbook is quickly consolidated.
    Currently, the children have planted nine crops, including tomatoes, kidney beans, sunflowers, peanuts, and castor beans, on the land they have cultivated at the crop cultivation station of their farm. Young horticulturalists often diligently water and rake the ridges in their spare time... During a visit to the crop cultivation station, the students excitedly told me that this year they will graft tomatoes and potatoes together, so that tomatoes grow on top and potatoes grow underneath. They also plan to graft kidney beans and cucumbers together, so that the cucumbers grow like strings of kidney beans. In crop cultivation, the young horticulturalists are most concerned about oil crops. They plan to use artificial pollination to make their sunflowers grow better and get a bigger harvest.
    Beside the white sheepfold of the farm's livestock breeding station, I met the farm's director, Zhang Guifa. This sixteen-year-old
  "three-good" student was instructing several breeders in white overalls to milk the goats and add feed. When the principal introduced him to me, he told me a story about him and a lamb named "Bajina" ("Bajina" is named after a lamb in a fable, meaning "good"). The story is like this: when the lamb Bajina was sent to the farm, the sheepfold had not yet been repaired. One night, it suddenly rained heavily. Zhang Guifa woke up in shock and thought that the sheepfold did not have a shed, so he put on his clothes, braved the heavy rain, ran to the sheepfold, and hugged "Bajina" and the other three sheep who were getting wet in the rain into the house, wiped the rain off them, and waited until dawn. This incident moved all the students.
    The young director led me to visit their livestock breeding station. The white sheepfolds and rabbit houses were cleaned very well. The director picked up a small rabbit and said that they will study under the guidance of their teacher how to use mating to improve this common rabbit into a long-haired rabbit of an improved breed; and how to raise them so that the goats can produce more milk. In their Small Five-Year Plan, they plan to develop the farm's sheep from four to more than six, and increase the current milk production from nine bottles to more than a dozen bottles per day. "When we squeeze out more goat milk," the young director said, "we will send it to the workers and volunteer uncles to drink." They also plan to raise bees next year and do more research work.
    Finally, we visited the flower and tree cultivation station. In the flower and tree cultivation station, the children not only planted apples, apricot trees, and cypress trees, but also cultivated sixteen kinds of (perennial) woody flowers indoors, such as Yang hydrangea, spiny plum, and butterfly begonia, and planted more than thirty kinds of (annual) herbaceous flowers in the outdoor flowerbeds, such as cockscomb, Globe amaranth, and vanilla. The children of the youth agricultural experiment station told me: next year, they will send the best seeds they have cultivated to Anshan for the workers to plant next to the blast furnace; and send the best seeds to their friends in Beijing—the Young Pioneers—so that more beautiful flowers will bloom in the gardens of Beijing.

    在一个少年农业实验场里  
    文天申
    在沈阳通往南郊区的公路边，在许多杨树围绕着的、环境幽美的城南小学校里，最近建立了一个小型的、一亩半地的少年农业实验场。这个农场是学校少先队在老师的帮助下，结合着小五年计划活动建立的。农场的场长、总技师、站长、技术员和会计都由学生自己担任。孩子们把这个农场划分为花木培养站、作物培植站、家畜饲养站三个部分。在政府、学校和南塔蔬菜生产合作社的支持和帮助下，他们有了一些生产资料和优良的种子，还有四头山羊，六只小兔。孩子们为了丰富自己的农业生产知识，还在农业实验场成立以前，他们就经常访问农民叔叔，向他们学习培植和饲养的经验。从农场成立的那天起，他们就聘请了和他们有着深厚友谊的南塔蔬菜生产合作社的副社长杨建华担任他们的技术顾问。
    不久以前，我访问了城南小学和他们的少年农业实验场。
      “孩子们的活动是怎样和教学结合起来的呢？”当校长谈到这个问题的时候，翻开了一本初小四年级的语文课本说：“这里有许多是关于植物的生长，种子的发芽，植物怎样吸收水分和养料的课文，但过去，孩子们得到的知识只是停留在课本上。”现在，通过实验农场的活动，学校的教师结合着教学，对孩子们进行辅导，使孩子们从课本上学到的知识，很快就巩固起来了。
    目前，孩子们已经在他们农场作物培植站所开垦的土地上种上了西红柿、芸豆、向日葵、花生、蓖麻等九种作物。少年园艺家们利用课余时间，经常在田畦上辛勤地浇水、耙地……在作物培植站参观的时候，同学们兴奋地告诉我，今年他们要把西红柿和土豆嫁接起来，让它上面长西红柿，下面长土豆。他们还计划把芸豆和黄瓜嫁接起来，使黄瓜长得像一串串的芸豆那样。在作物培植中，少年园艺家们最关心的是油料作物。他们准备用人工授粉的方法，使他们种植的向日葵长得更好，得到更大的收获。
    在农场家畜饲养站的洁白羊圈旁，我见到了农场的场长张贵发。这个十六岁的
  “三好”学生正指导几个穿着白色工作服的饲养员给奶羊挤奶，上饲料。校长在向我作介绍的时候，曾经告诉我一段关于他和小羊羔“巴吉那”的故事（“巴吉那”是根据一个寓言里的小羊的名字起的，意思是“好”）。事情是这样的：当小羊巴吉那送到农场里来的时候，羊圈还没有修好。一天晚上，突然下了大雨。张贵发从床上惊醒起来，想到羊圈还没有棚，于是他就披上衣服，冒着大雨跑到羊圈去，把正淋着雨的“巴吉那”和其他的三只羊抱进屋里，擦干它们身上的雨水，一直守候到天明。这件事感动了所有的同学。
    少年场长领我参观了他们的家畜饲养站，洁白的羊圈和兔舍打扫得非常干净。场长抱起一个小兔说，他们将在老师的指导下研究如何使这种普通小兔经过交配得到改良品种的长毛兔；研究怎样饲养，使奶羊能产更多的奶。在他们的小五年计划里，他们计划把农场的羊从四头发展到六头以上，把现在的羊奶产量，由每天九瓶增加到十几瓶。“等到我们挤出更多的羊奶的时候，”少年场长说：“我们要把它送给工人和志愿军叔叔们喝。”他们明年还计划养蜜蜂，做更多的研究工作。
    最后，我们参观了花木培植站。在花木培植站里，孩子们不仅栽植了苹果、杏树和柏树，还在室内培植着杨绣球、刺梅，蝴蝶海棠等十六种（多年生）木本花，在室外的花圃里种植了鸡冠花、万年红、香草花等三十多种（当年生）草本花。少年农业实验场的孩子们对我说：明年，他们要把他们培植出来的最好的种子寄到鞍山，让工人叔叔们种在高炉旁；把最好最好的种子寄到北京给他们的朋友——少先队员们，让更多的美丽的花朵，在北京的花园里开放。
