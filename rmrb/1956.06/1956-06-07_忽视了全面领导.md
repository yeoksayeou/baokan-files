Neglecting Comprehensive Leadership
By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin

When discussing which agricultural producers' cooperative was the best in Echeng County, Hubei Province, with some cadres, they all unanimously praised the model cooperative established by the county party committee in Dushan Township – the Xuguang No. 1 Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. I stayed in this cooperative for a few days. This cooperative is indeed well-managed. It has formulated production plans and labor plans, established field management systems, and the implemented contracting production to teams, financial responsibility to teams, and piece-rate systems have all gained good experience. Fertilizer reserves are also very sufficient. In addition to storing more than 300,000 catties of cotton cake, bean cake, and chemical fertilizers, each mu of land also has an average of 500 to 1,000 dan of natural fertilizer accumulated. This year, the cooperative has adopted new technical measures for the improved japonica rice and Daizi cotton varieties. The members have a high level of confidence in increasing production.

However, around the model cooperative, there are fourteen general cooperatives (advanced cooperatives, same below). How are these cooperatives doing? Has the model cooperative achieved its goal of using a single point to drive forward the whole area? From conversations with some district and township staff, it is understood that the work of using a single point to drive forward the whole area is not being done well.

Although the model cooperative has gained good experience in contracting production to teams, financial responsibility to teams, and piece-rate systems, the Xuguang No. 5 Agricultural Producers' Cooperative and the Xuguang No. 3 Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, which are very close by, do not know what these management systems are all about. The members of these cooperatives still use work-point recording for their labor, and the attendance rate is not high. These cooperatives have not fully adopted new technical measures for the improved japonica rice and Daizi cotton varieties this year. The fertilizer reserves in these cooperatives are also insufficient: among the fourteen general cooperatives, nine cooperatives do not have superphosphate, eleven cooperatives do not have ammonium sulfate, and eight cooperatives do not have bean cake (because they cannot obtain the same amount of loans as the model cooperative). The amount of natural fertilizer accumulated is also small. Therefore, more than 10,000 mu of cotton fields in the fourteen general cooperatives in the whole township have not yet been top-dressed.

The cadre strength of the model cooperative is very strong. More than a dozen staff members from both the special district and the county levels have been stationed there. However, why can't the work of using a single point to drive forward the whole area be done well? Because they have neglected the leadership method of combining points with the whole area. Some general cooperatives have a weak work foundation and need to strengthen leadership, but some staff members believe that the work of these "backward cooperatives" is difficult and are not willing to go; even if they go, they just "take a turn" and leave, without solving any problems. In order to disseminate the management experience of the model cooperative, the staff members once convened a field meeting for the leaders of the general cooperatives, but after the meeting, very little was done to specifically help the general cooperatives (especially those with a weak work foundation) to implement it.

This year, Dushan Township plans to achieve an average yield of 1,000 catties per mu for rice and wheat and an average yield of 100 catties per mu for cotton throughout the township. The production increase targets are very high. However, if the backward state of production management in the majority of cooperatives is not changed, it will be difficult to complete this production increase task.

The failure to do a good job of using a single point to drive forward the whole area reflects the county party committee's neglect of the principle of overall planning in leading production. This shortcoming of the county party committee's leadership in production is also manifested in another aspect, that is, it has focused on advanced cooperatives while neglecting the leadership of elementary cooperatives and individual farmers.

In Echeng County, the number of farm households participating in advanced cooperatives accounts for 64.4% of the total number of farm households, the number of farm households participating in elementary cooperatives accounts for 23.9% of the total number of farm households, and individual farmers account for 11.7% of the total number of farm households. These figures show that in order to ensure overall production increase in the county, two-thirds of the area must rely on advanced cooperatives, and one-third of the area must rely on elementary cooperatives and individual farmers. Strengthening the leadership of advanced cooperatives is undoubtedly very important; but the leadership of elementary cooperatives and individual farmers cannot be ignored either. However, the current situation is not like this. From the county to the district and township levels, many staff members only have advanced cooperatives in their minds when they mention agricultural producers' cooperatives; when they mention production, they only have advanced cooperatives in their minds. In name, some cadres are responsible for leading the production of elementary cooperatives and individual farmers, but in reality, in many places, the people responsible for this work are either too busy because they have too many concurrent jobs or are too weak in their ability to lead. Since the beginning of spring, some meetings convened by the county, district, and township levels have mainly studied the problems of advanced cooperatives and rarely studied the problems of elementary cooperatives and individual farmers. Because of the lack of leadership, many problems of elementary cooperatives and individual farmers cannot be solved. Some elementary cooperatives have not properly handled the "four appraisals," and the thinking of the members is very confused. In Taihe District, only eighteen of the 110 elementary cooperatives have implemented contracting production to teams, and the phenomenon of work stoppages is very serious. The financial management of many elementary cooperatives is chaotic. In Yanji District, most of the 123 elementary cooperatives have not formulated production plans, but instead copy the production plans of the model cooperatives to decorate their facades. Many elementary cooperatives lack fertilizer (especially fertilizer needed for top-dressing). In Caopo Township and Yangye Township, 80% of the early rice in some elementary cooperatives is transplanted into whitening fields (fields where the soil is depleted). As for the production of individual farmers, it is even worse than that of elementary cooperatives.

This year, Echeng County, from the county to the district and township levels, has formulated comprehensive development production plans, but the one-sidedness in leadership methods is hindering the realization of the plans. The Echeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has paid attention to this problem. They analyzed that the reason for neglecting comprehensive leadership is that after the county launched a high tide of agricultural production, they were not clear enough in their thinking on how to comprehensively and systematically lead production, and therefore the work methods could not adapt to the requirements of the large-scale production movement. Now they are studying measures to comprehensively lead production.

### 忽视了全面领导

    忽视了全面领导 
    本报记者　古维进
    在湖北省鄂城县，同一些干部谈起全县那个农业生产合作社办得最好，他们都一致推崇县委在杜山乡办的重点社——旭光第一农业生产合作社。我在这个社住了几天。这个社的确办得很好。它制定了生产计划和劳动计划，建立了田间管理制度，推行的包工包产、财务包干、定额计件等都取得一套较好的经验，肥料储备也很充足。全社除存有棉饼、豆饼、化学肥料等三十多万斤外，每亩田还平均积自然肥五百担到一千担。这个社今年改种的粳稻和岱字棉良种，都采取了新的技术措施。社员的增产信心很高。
    但是，在重点社的周围，有十四个一般社（高级社，下同）。这些社办得怎样呢？重点社是不是做到以点带面了呢？从一些区、乡工作人员的谈话里了解，以点带面的工作还搞得不好。
    尽管重点社在包工包产、财务包干、定额计件等方面已经取得较好的经验，但是，相距很近的旭光第五农业生产合作社和旭光第三农业生产合作社等还不知道这些管理制度是怎么一回事情。这些社的社员做活还是评工记分，出勤率不高。这些社今年改种的粳稻和岱字棉良种都没有完全采取新的技术措施。这些社的肥料储备也不充足：在十四个一般社里，有九个社没有过磷酸钙，有十一个社没有硫酸氨，有八个社没有豆饼（因为它们不能得到像重点社那样充足的贷款），积的自然肥料也少。因此全乡十四个一般社有一万多亩棉田还没有追肥。
    重点社的干部力量是很强的，光专区、县两级就曾经派出十多个工作人员住在那里，但是，为什么不能做好以点带面的工作呢？因为他们忽视了点面结合的领导方法。有些一般社的工作基础较差，需要加强领导，但是有些工作人员认为这些“落后社”的工作难搞，不大愿意去；有时即使去了也是“转一转”就走，没有解决什么问题。工作人员为了传播重点社的经营管理经验，曾经召集一般社的领导人员举行现场会议，但是会议以后，如何具体帮助一般社（特别是工作基础较差的社）去贯彻执行，却做得很少。
    今年杜山乡计划全乡的稻麦为平均亩产千斤，棉花平均亩产百斤，增产的指标是很大的。但是，如果不改变大多数社生产管理上的落后状况，要想完成这个增产任务是有困难的。
    没有做好以点带面的情况，反映了县委领导生产中忽视统筹兼顾的原则。县委领导生产的这个缺点还表现在另一个方面，就是抓了高级社，忽视了对初级社和单干农民的领导。
    鄂城县参加高级社的农户占总农户数64.4％，参加初级社的农户占总农户数的23.9％，单干农民占总农户数的11.7％。这个数字表明，要想保证全县全面增产，有三分之二的地区要依靠高级社，有三分之一的地区要依靠初级社和单干农民。加强对高级社的领导无疑是很重要的；但是也不能忽视对初级社和单干农民的领导。现在的情况却不是这样。从县到区乡，不少的工作人员提起农业生产合作社，脑子里只有高级社；提起生产，脑子里也只有高级社。干部的工作分工，名义上是有人负责领导初级社和单干农民的生产，实际上有许多地方负责这个工作的人，不是因为兼职多忙不过来，就是能力太弱，领导不起来。入春以来，县、区、乡召开的一些会议，主要是研究高级社的问题，很少研究初级社单干农民的问题。初级社和单干农民因为缺乏领导，有许多问题不能得到解决。有些初级社的“四评”还没有很好处理，社员的思想很混乱。在太和区，110个初级社中推行包工包产的只有十八个社，窝工的现象很严重。不少的初级社的财务管理是混乱的。燕矶区的123个初级社里，绝大部分没有制定生产计划，而是抄重点社的生产计划去装饰门面。许多初级社缺乏肥料（特别是缺追肥所需的肥料）。草陂乡和杨叶乡有些初级社有80％的早稻是插白田的。至于单干农民的生产更不如初级社。
      今年鄂城县从县到区乡都制定了全面发展生产规划，但是领导方法上的片面性却在妨碍规划的实现。中共鄂城县委对于这个问题已经引起重视。他们分析产生忽视全面领导的原因，是全县掀起农业生产高潮以后，对于如何全面地有计划地领导生产，在思想上不够明确，因而在工作方法上不能适应大生产运动的要求。现在他们正在研究全面领导生产的措施。
