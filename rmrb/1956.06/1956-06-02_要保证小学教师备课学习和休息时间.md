After inspecting primary school work in Shanghai, Zheng Yun, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made suggestions to the Shanghai Education Bureau regarding guaranteeing primary school teachers' preparation, study, and rest time, based on the busy and chaotic situation she observed among primary school teachers.

This outstanding primary school teacher, nearly sixty years old and with thirty-nine years of teaching experience, recently inspected four primary schools in Shanghai and held separate discussions with teachers and principals from twelve primary schools. The teachers told her that they had three "mores" in their lives: more meetings, more concurrent jobs, and more homework to grade. From Monday to Saturday, their time after school was filled with meetings and reports, and the work of preparing lessons and grading homework that was not finished during the day had to be done in the evenings and on holidays. Teachers and principals said that they were not afraid of being busy, but the problem was that they were not busy with teaching.

According to Zheng Yun's understanding, Zhang Weichi, a natural science and manual labor teacher at the Affiliated Primary School of the First Normal School, attended eleven meetings in the past week, not including political and professional study sessions. Ni Guyin, Deputy Director of Teaching at the Affiliated Primary School of the First Normal School, and Liu Yuanzhang, Chief Counselor of the First Central Primary School in the Yimiao District, and other excellent teachers, in addition to attending various meetings within the school, also had to give reports outside the school, introduce experiences, receive foreign guests, and attend various meetings at the municipal and district levels. They said that there were too many social activities.

At the symposium, some school principals also reflected that the district cultural and educational sections were often busy with administrative affairs and had relaxed their leadership in teaching and teachers' political studies. Some district cultural and educational sections held too many meetings that were long, and of low quality. The districts also frequently transferred teachers to participate in temporary activities, forcing these schools to reschedule classes, combine classes, or even cancel classes.

After analyzing and studying the information she learned during the inspection, Zheng Yun made suggestions to the Shanghai Education Bureau for improvement. Zheng Yun's opinion is that Shanghai primary schools are beginning to implement the primary school education plan and the five-level scoring system, and the tasks of the teachers are heavy. One afternoon after school and all of Saturday afternoon should be reserved for teachers to prepare lessons. Zheng Yun also suggested reducing meetings, not concentrating social activities on a few individuals, and not arbitrarily transferring teachers to jobs that do not necessarily have to be done by teachers. She hopes that the work of the Shanghai municipal and district education administrative departments can be further oriented towards teaching.

The Shanghai Education Bureau has studied Zheng Yun's opinions and is preparing to take effective measures to solve the problem of primary school teachers being overworked. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 要保证小学教师备课学习和休息时间

    要保证小学教师备课学习和休息时间
    政协全国委员会委员郑芸在上海视察小学工作以后，根据她看到的小学教师工作忙乱的情况，向上海市教育局提出了保证小学教师备课、学习和休息时间的建议。
    这位年近六十、有着三十九年教学经验的优秀小学教师，最近在上海视察了四所小学，并且同十二个小学的教师和负责人分别举行了座谈。教师们向她反映，他们的生活中有三多：会议多、兼职多、批改作业多。从星期一到星期六，放学以后的时间都排满了会议、报告，备课和批改白天未改完的作业的工作只能放在晚上和假日进行。教师和校长们说，对于忙，他们并不怕，问题是没有忙在教学上。
    据郑芸了解，第一师范学校附属小学自然与手工劳动课教师张维篪在最近这一周内共开了十一个会，还不包括政治、业务学习会在内。第一师范学校附属小学副教导主任倪谷音、邑庙区第一中心小学总辅导员刘元璋等优秀教师，除参加校内各种会议外，还要到校外做报告、介绍经验、接送外宾以及出席市、区的各种会议。他们说，社会活动实在太多了。
    在座谈会上，有些学校的校长还反映：区文教科经常忙于行政事务，对教学业务和教师政治学习的领导放松了。有些区的文教科召开会议次数多、时间长、质量低。区里还经常抽调教师参加临时性的活动，使这些学校不得不调课、并班上课，甚至缺课。
    郑芸对视察中了解到的情况进行分析研究后，向上海市教育局提出了改进的建议。郑芸的意见是：上海各小学正在开始贯彻小学教育计划和五级计分制，教师们的任务是繁重的。一周内应当留出一个下午放学后的工作时间和星期六下午的全部工作时间给教师备课。郑芸还建议减少会议，社会活动不要集中在少数人身上，不是非由教师担任不可的工作，不要随便抽调教师担任。她希望上海市、区教育行政部门的工作能进一步面向教学。
    上海市教育局已经研究了郑芸的意见，并准备采取有效措施解决小学教师的忙乱问题。（新华社）
