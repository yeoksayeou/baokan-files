Changsha Dispatch: The broad masses of staff and workers in the grain departments of Hunan Province have made many new creations in improving work efficiency and promoting "Four-No Grain Depots". The automatic windmill created by Ma Yushan and other comrades in Huangshi District, Taoyuan County, can automatically sort grain without manpower or electricity. As long as someone takes turns pouring rice into the hopper, this type of windmill can sort more than 220,000 catties of grain per day, including both the mill and the chute. The insect removal efficiency is above 89%, which is 4.7 times higher than that of a single person operating a single chute. The Changde County Grain Bureau, in order to change the situation in this area where there are many dikes and embankments, making grain transportation laborious and time-consuming, recently successfully trial-produced a "dike-crossing loading and unloading machine". This is a bridge-shaped machine that can be pulled by manpower or electricity. If this machine is widely used for grain transportation in lake areas, it can greatly improve loading and unloading efficiency. Grain workers at Fulinpu in Changsha County have created a "grain and rice dispensing scale". Using this method to sell grain, only one person sitting at the worktable is needed to unify and control the four work processes of collecting money, issuing tickets, weighing, and filling grain.

In order to summarize and promote these advanced experiences, the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau convened a provincial grain (oil) work advanced experience exchange meeting on May 27. At the same time, an exhibition of advanced experiences and model deeds in grain work was held, exhibiting more than 50 kinds of physical objects and models, and more than 100 sets of pictures and charts.

    湖南粮食部门职工的新创造
    本报长沙讯　湖南省粮食部门的广大职工，在提高工作效率、推行“四无粮仓”中有许多新的创造。桃源县黄石区马玉山等同志创造的自动风车，可以不用人力和电力，只要有人轮流向漏斗灌米就可自动整理粮食，用这种风车整理粮食，每天连车带溜可整理粮食二十二万多斤，除虫效率在89％以上，较单人单溜可以提高工作效率四点七倍。常德县粮食局最近为了改变这个地区堤垸多，转运粮食费力费时的情况，最近试制成功一种“翻堤装卸机”这是一种天桥形的机器，它可用人力也可用电力牵引，湖区运粮如果广泛采用这个机器，就可大大提高装卸效率。长沙县福临铺的粮食工作人员创造一种“谷米分衡器”，用这个方法卖粮，只需一个人坐在工作台上，就可把收款、开票、司秤、灌粮四个工作过程，统一掌握起来。
    湖南省粮食厅为了总结和推广这些先进经验，在五月二十七日召开了全省粮食（油脂）工作先进经验交流会。同时，举办了一个粮食工作先进经验与模范事迹展览会，展出实物和模型五十多种，画片和图表一百多套。
