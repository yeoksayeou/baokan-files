To the Editor:

    Some enterprises use an egalitarian approach when distributing bonuses in socialist emulation campaigns. For example, in the first quarter, a factory in Shandong province distributed bonuses equally among all workshops. One workshop, after receiving the bonus, allocated two to three yuan each to some of the more advanced workers, and used the rest of the money to hold a tea party for the entire workshop. At the Harbin XinXing Paper Mill, the number of employees receiving bonuses accounted for more than 96% of the total number of employees. Except for the two factory directors, almost everyone received a bonus. At the Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Changsha Machine Tool Factory, the number of award recipients accounted for 30% of the total number of employees, with an average bonus of only one yuan and three jiao per person. In one instance, the Changsha Transportation Company conducted daily evaluations and distributed awards every day during a particular task. The number of award recipients was very large, but the amount of the awards was very small, averaging only about one jiao per person. In the Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 6's socialist emulation campaign, every worker was able to get some kind of award, with some workers only receiving a piece of candy.

    The reason why some enterprise leaders use this egalitarian method to distribute bonuses is that they have a vague understanding of the state's reward policy. They mistakenly believe that if most workers do not receive bonuses, those who do not will have grievances. However, the result of doing so is that not only are the advanced producers who should be rewarded dissatisfied, but also the general workers are not happy with the bonuses they receive. In order to give full play to the material incentive effect of bonuses on production, the leading cadres of these enterprises should conscientiously implement the state's reward policy and overcome the tendency of egalitarianism.

### 反对平均主义的奖励办法

    反对平均主义的奖励办法编辑同志：
    有些企业单位在社会主义竞赛工作中用平均主义的态度来分配奖励金。例如，山东某工厂在第一季度把奖金平均分配给各车间，有一个车间拿到奖金以后，除了给一部分比较先进的工人每人二元到三元的奖金以外，把其余的钱用来开了个全车间的茶话会。哈尔滨新兴造纸厂得奖金的职工人数占职工总数的96％以上，除去两名厂长以外，几乎全都得了奖。湖南农业机械厂、长沙机床厂得奖人数占全厂总人数30％，平均每人得的奖金只有一元三角。长沙市搬运公司在有一次任务中，每天都有评比，每天都发奖，得奖的人数很多，但是奖金额很少，每人得奖平均只有一角钱左右。东北石油六厂在社会主义竞赛中，每个工人多少都能得点奖，有的工人只得到一块糖吃。
    某些企业领导人员之所以用这种平均主义的办法来发奖金，是因为他们对国家的奖励政策认识模糊。他们错误地认为，如果不让大部分工人都拿到奖金，那末拿不到奖金的人就会有意见。但是这样做的结果，不但使应该得奖的先进生产者不满意，而且也使一般工人拿了奖金也并不高兴。为了发挥奖金对生产的物质鼓励作用，这些企业的领导干部应该认真执行国家的奖励政策，克服平均主义的偏向。
