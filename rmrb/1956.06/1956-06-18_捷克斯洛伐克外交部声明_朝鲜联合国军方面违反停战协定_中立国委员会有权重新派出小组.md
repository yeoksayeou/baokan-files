Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 17th: The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 15th, announcing that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) has the right to resend inspection teams to both parts of Korea when necessary. The statement said:

	On May 31, 1956, General Carter B. Magruder, representative of the United Nations Command, notified the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) of the decision to "temporarily suspend" the "activities" of the inspection teams in South Korea. Despite the fact that the NNSC, on the initiative of the Swedish member and in accordance with Paragraph 61 of the Armistice Agreement, unanimously recommended to the MAC the temporary withdrawal of the NNSC inspection teams from the ports of entry in both parts of Korea, this decision was implemented. The United Nations Command rejected this recommendation, which was supported by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and on June 9, 1956, prohibited the inspection teams from operating and being present in South Korea.

	These unilateral measures taken by the United Nations Command against the activities of the NNSC in South Korea constitute a serious violation of the Armistice Agreement, and the United States government and the governments of other countries participating in the United Nations Command must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this action.

	In order to cover up this fact, which is clear to the whole world, the United Nations Command, as usual, slandered the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNSC and made fabricated accusations against the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic resolutely refutes these slanderous accusations, considering them a conspiracy to deceive public opinion regarding the actual reasons for taking such illegal actions against the NNSC. Obviously, the real and main reason is that the activities of the NNSC in South Korea constitute an obstacle to the further arming of the Syngman Rhee troops. According to a June 2, 1956, Agence France-Presse report, "The South Korean President believes that the order to abolish the NNSC is not enough; he demands the abolition of the entire Armistice Agreement and demands that the United States hand over weapons, jet aircraft, and other war materials." His Foreign Minister also made such demands publicly. These and other similar remarks show the world the true purpose of the steps taken by the United Nations Command against the NNSC in South Korea.

	Based on the inviolable provisions of the Armistice Agreement, the Czechoslovak Government supports the view unanimously adopted by all members of the NNSC that the withdrawal of the NNSC inspection teams from the ports is only a temporary measure caused by the current situation in South Korea; the NNSC has the right and the obligation, in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, to resend inspection teams to both parts of Korea whenever necessary.

    捷克斯洛伐克外交部声明
    朝鲜联合国军方面违反停战协定
    中立国委员会有权重新派出小组
    据新华社布拉格17日电　捷克斯洛伐克外交部十五日发表声明，宣布中立国监察委员会有权在必要时重新派遣视察小组到朝鲜两部分去。声明说：
    1956年5月31日，联合国军总司令部代表、美国的加德将军把“暂时停止”视察小组在南朝鲜的“活动”的决定通知了军事停战委员会。尽管中立国监察委员会根据瑞典委员的倡议并且根据停战协定第六十一款的规定一致向军事停战委员会建议从朝鲜两部分的口岸暂时撤回中立国监察委员会视察小组，这个决定还是执行了。联合国军方面拒绝了这个得到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面的赞同的建议，并且在1956年6月9日禁止视察小组在南朝鲜活动和存在。
    联合国军方面对中立国监察委员会机构在南朝鲜的活动所采取的这些片面措施严重地违反了停战协定，美国政府和其他参加联合国军的各国政府必须对这种行动的后果负完全的责任。
    为了掩饰全世界都明白的这一事实，联合国军方面像通常一样地对中立国监察委员会中的捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员进行了诽谤，并且对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面提出了捏造的指责。捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府坚决驳斥这些诽谤性的指责，认为这是企图在对中立国监察委员会采取这种非法行动的实际原因方面欺骗舆论的一种阴谋。显然，真正的、主要的原因是因为中立国监察委员会的机构在南朝鲜的活动构成了进一步武装李承晚军队的障碍。据法新社1956年6月2日的消息报道，“南朝鲜总统认为废除中立国监察委员会的命令还不够，他要求废除整个停战协定，并且要求美国交给武器、喷气式飞机和其他战争物资。”他的外务部长官也在公开提出这种要求。这些言论和其他类似的言论向全世界表明了联合国军方面在南朝鲜对中立国监察委员会所采取的步骤的真正目的。
    根据停战协定中不可破坏的条款，捷克斯洛伐克政府支持中立国监察委员会全体委员一致采取的观点，即：中立国监察委员会视察小组从口岸撤回只是由于南朝鲜目前的局势所引起的暂时措施；中立国监察委员会有权利也有义务根据停战协定的规定在任何必要的时候重新派遣视察小组到朝鲜两部分去。
