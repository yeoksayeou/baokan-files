    Datong Coal Mine, Yongdingzhuang Mine
    Promoting the Advanced Experience of Zhang Wanfu's Tunneling Team
    (By Our Newspaper) The several advanced experiences of Zhang Wanfu's tunneling team in fully utilizing working hours have been widely adopted in the Yongdingzhuang Mine of Datong Coal Mine. The Zhang Chenglai tunneling team, which previously often failed to complete its tasks, has been able to complete its tasks every month since March after implementing sectional transportation and the "snake shedding skin" shift handover method. The remaining tunneling teams, such as Meng Bingming's and Zhang Fugui's, have caught up with the advanced Zhang Wanfu team, and they have all completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. According to statistics as of May 20, the workers of Meng Bingming's team had tunneled more than 700 meters beyond the state-stipulated plan for the first half of the year, and Zhang Fugui's team had also tunneled more than 200 meters beyond the plan.

    大同煤矿永定庄矿
    推广张万福掘进组的先进经验
    本报讯　张万福掘进组的几项充分利用工时的先进经验，已经在大同煤矿永定庄矿普遍推广采用。以往老完不成任务的张成来掘进组，实行分段运输和“蛇退皮”交接班方法以后，三月份以来已经能月月完成任务。其余的孟秉明、张富贵等掘进组，已经赶上先进的张万福组，他们都分别提前完成了今年上半年的生产计划。到五月二十日统计，孟秉明组的工人们比国家规定的上半年计划多掘进了七百多公尺，张富贵组也多掘进了二百多公尺。
