Xinhua News Agency, via TASS reports: At the reception held in the Grand Kremlin Palace on June 5th for Yugoslav President Tito, Bulganin told Tito and his entourage that the first few days of their stay in Moscow had demonstrated the Soviet people’s deep affection for the Yugoslav people. They regard the Yugoslav people as brothers, as comrades-in-arms, as comrades fighting together for the bright future of mankind: Communism.

In his speech, Bulganin said that we can now say with complete certainty that, thanks to our joint efforts, the measures stipulated in the Soviet-Yugoslav Declaration have been successfully implemented. Our relations have been greatly developed and consolidated. This is a good foundation for further developing political cooperation and further developing economic, cultural, and scientific ties.

At the same time, it is no exaggeration to say that the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is of great significance not only for the restoration of cooperation and friendship between our two countries, but also for the entire international life.

Bulganin emphasized that Yugoslavia has adopted a similar position to the Soviet Union on many international issues. He said that it is important to point this out. We have every reason to believe that the similarity of positions will enable us to further expand our cooperation in international affairs.

Our friendship and cooperation will continue to develop and prosper on a solid foundation of mutual understanding and mutual trust, and on the basis of Leninist principles.

At this reception, which was filled with an extremely sincere atmosphere, Tito also made a long and enthusiastic speech. He said that it is undeniable that the initiatives put forward by the Soviet government in recent years have greatly promoted the easing of world tensions. This has promoted, and will further promote, the establishment of direct and regular contacts between peoples of all countries, and the elimination of distrust left over from the past. This development increasingly strongly requires that the problems that have matured must be solved. In this regard, it is of great significance to eliminate the obstacles that still hinder free trade and broader European economic, cultural, and general cooperation.

Tito then mentioned disarmament as one of the urgent problems that needs to be solved. He said that in this regard, the Yugoslav people welcome the Soviet government's recent decision to reduce its armed forces and believe that this decision will help increase international trust, thereby making it possible to solve the problem of universal disarmament within the United Nations.

Tito said, I want to particularly emphasize that the Yugoslav people attach great importance to the Soviet government's expressed willingness to support and assist underdeveloped and emerging countries in developing their economies. Tito pointed out that the only way to achieve common progress and eliminate differences is to fully develop international unity and cooperation.

Tito pointed out that Yugoslavia has made a considerable contribution to creating new conditions in international relations. The Yugoslav people are watching the Soviet government's intentions with full understanding and sympathy. He said, I am deeply convinced that the all-round cooperation between our two countries will benefit our two peoples and will enable us to exchange opinions and experiences; and such exchanges will bring great benefits to the development of socialism.

    布尔加宁和铁托在大克里姆林宫招待会上发言
    苏南在许多国际问题上立场一致
    新华社据塔斯社报道　在六月五日在大克里姆林宫为南斯拉夫总统铁托举行的招待会上，布尔加宁对铁托和他的随行人员说，你们在莫斯科度过的头几天已经证明，苏联人民对南斯拉夫人民怀着深挚的友爱。他们把南斯拉夫人民当作兄弟，当作战友，当作共同为共产主义这个人类的光明前途而斗争的同志。
    布尔加宁在讲话中说，现在我们已经可以完全肯定地说：由于我们共同的努力，苏南宣言所规定的措施已经顺利实现。我们的关系大大地发展了、巩固了。这对于进一步发展政治合作，进一步发展经济上、文化上和科学上的联系是一个良好的基础。
    同时，可以毫不夸张地说，苏联同南斯拉夫关系的正常化，不仅对我们两国间的合作和友谊的恢复有重要意义，而且这种正常化还对整个国际生活产生了重大的影响。
    布尔加宁着重指出，南斯拉夫在许多国际问题上，采取了同苏联相似的立场。他说，指出这一点是很重要的。我们有一切根据可以认为，立场的相似，将使我们能够更加扩大我们在国际事务中的合作。
    我们的友谊和合作，今后也必将在互相谅解、互相信任的巩固基础之上，必将在列宁主义原则的基础之上，更加发展，更加繁荣起来。
    在这个充满着极其真诚气氛的招待会上，铁托也作了长篇热烈的讲话。他说，不可争辩的是，苏联政府在最近几年中提出的倡议，大大促进了世界紧张局势的缓和。这已经促进了，并且还将更加促进各国人民之间建立直接的和经常的接触，消除过去遗留下来的不信任。这种发展越来越强烈地首先要求必须解决已经成熟了的问题。在这方面，消除至今还妨碍着自由贸易和欧洲更广泛的经济、文化和一般的合作的障碍，是有很大意义的。
    铁托随后提到了作为迫切需要解决的问题之一的裁军问题。他说，在这方面，南斯拉夫人民欢迎苏联政府最近关于裁减武装部队的决定，并且认为这个决定有助于增进国际信任，从而有可能在联合国范围内解决普遍裁军问题。
    铁托说，我要特别着重指出，南斯拉夫人民十分重视苏联政府表示愿意支持和援助不发达的国家和新兴的国家，来发展它们的经济的这种愿望。铁托指出，要求得共同进步，要消除分歧，唯一的道路就是充分发展国际团结和合作。
    铁托指出，南斯拉夫对创造国际关系方面的新条件作了相当大的贡献。南斯拉夫人民以充分的了解和同情注视着苏联政府的意愿。他说，我深信：我们两国的全面合作将有利于我们两国人民，将使我们能够交换意见和经验；而这样的交换会给社会主义的发展带来很大的好处。
