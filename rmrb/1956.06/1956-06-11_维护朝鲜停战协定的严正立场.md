On May 31st, the American representative on the Korean Military Armistice Commission unilaterally announced that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams at all ports in South Korea must be completely withdrawn within one week. Agence France-Presse explained that this was the American side's "first step towards effectively disbanding the Supervisory Commission." This illegal unilateral decision by the American side seriously violates the letter and spirit of the Korean Armistice Agreement. In order to guarantee the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and also taking into account the practical difficulties of the Swedish and Swiss governments, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides agreed to the suggestion made by the Swedish government in March this year to temporarily withdraw the inspection teams stationed at designated ports; considering it as a temporary measure, as long as the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission retains the power to send inspection teams to each designated port again when needed. On June 4th, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides put forward the above suggestion at the meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, but it was unreasonably rejected by the United States. Subsequently, the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission suggested to the Military Armistice Commission that, without changing the legal status of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the inspection teams at specific ports should be temporarily withdrawn from both the North and the South to await agreement between the armistice parties on this matter. On June 7th, the Korean and Chinese sides proposed at the Military Armistice Commission to accept the suggestion of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the basis of not changing the powers of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, so that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission would continue to have the power to send teams to specific ports; but this reasonable suggestion was again unreasonably rejected by the United States. At the same time, the United States not only ignored the unanimous recommendation of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but also ordered all inspection teams stationed in South Korea to withdraw to the demilitarized zone by June 9th in the form of an ultimatum. This is a blatant violation of the armistice agreement, and an extremely impolite act towards neutral countries. All people with a sense of justice cannot help but express their indignation at this.

The regulations regarding inspections by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams are an important component of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and play a positive role in the implementation of the armistice agreement and the maintenance of the Korean armistice. Although the U.S. side loudly proclaims its willingness to "work to maintain the effectiveness of the armistice," it is actually very unwelcome to the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Since the armistice, the U.S. side has adopted various means to sabotage the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; from deception and insult to the use of violence, to today's firm demand for cancellation. The U.S. side believes that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is a troublesome "burden" to it, preventing it from expanding its military strength at will. Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford openly said that the United States is hindered and cannot "transport any modern weapons or aircraft into South Korea." "In my opinion, we may not be able to continue to abide by the terms of the armistice agreement indefinitely under the current circumstances."

In order to cover up its conspiracy activities to sabotage the armistice, the U.S. side falsely accused the Korean and Chinese sides of "worryingly" violating the armistice agreement. However, all the reports submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission prove that the Korean and Chinese sides strictly abide by the various provisions of the armistice agreement. At the request of the U.S. side, the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams have conducted many investigations at ports in North Korea, and the results can only prove that the slander of the slanderers is completely unfounded. Not long ago, the Swiss representative of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also stated that he had "received no information" regarding the rumors of the Lee Seung-man group about the import of atomic weapons into North Korea.

It is precisely the United States that is "worryingly" violating the armistice agreement. The Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have revealed with factual evidence the illegal acts of the U.S. side in transporting a large number of reinforcement weapons and military supplies into South Korea. United Press International admitted that the United States has given South Korea 420 million U.S. dollars in military "aid" this year alone. The South Korean army has increased from sixteen combat divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty. The United States is also organizing new air force units for South Korea; by September of this year, the number of ships handed over to South Korea will reach twenty-seven. The U.S. troops stationed in South Korea "regularly" maintain a state of combat readiness. General White, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, even openly said that his troops "can open fire within fifteen seconds." Encouraged by the United States, the Lee Seung-man group continues to shout "Northward advance" from Seoul.

For a long time, the U.S.'s conspiracy activities have threatened peace in Korea. But it needs to be pointed out that it is no accident that the U.S. chose this time to intensify its sabotage of the armistice agreement and resolutely cancel the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. Recently, the overall international situation has tended to ease, and the people of all countries are full of hope and confidence in negotiating and resolving international issues in a spirit of cooperation and understanding. In Europe, with the summit talks between the Soviet Union and Britain, and between the Soviet Union and France, a broad path has been opened for peaceful coexistence. In the East, with Cambodia's adherence to a policy of peace and neutrality and the changes in the political situation in Ceylon, Thailand and the Philippines are also demanding changes in the unequal relations between the U.S. and them. The loopholes in the "embargo" are getting bigger and bigger, and the number of countries seeking to develop trade with countries in the democratic camp is increasing. At such a time, the U.S.'s new actions that seriously threaten the Korean armistice are an attempt to create new tensions, divert world public attention from the easing of the international situation, and thereby force its "allies" to follow it. The fact that some countries follow the U.S.'s approach on the Korean issue can only show that they lack the foresight they should have.

However, the U.S.'s arrogant act of sabotaging the Korean armistice will not achieve its goals. The statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on June 10 fully expresses the solemn position of the Chinese people. Peace in Korea is related to peace in Asia and the world, and all peace-loving people in the world will support the position of the Korean and Chinese sides in maintaining the authority of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams, and oppose the U.S. dragging Korea to the "brink of war."

### 维护朝鲜停战协定的严正立场

    维护朝鲜停战协定的严正立场
    五月三十一日，朝鲜军事停战委员会的美方代表片面宣布，朝鲜中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜各个口岸的视察小组必须在一星期以内全部撤离南朝鲜。法新社解释说，这是美方“走向事实上解散这个监察委员会的第一个步骤。”美方这种非法的片面决定，严重地违反了朝鲜停战协定的文字和精神。为了保障朝鲜停战协定的实施，同时也考虑到瑞典和瑞士政府的实际困难，朝中方面的代表同意了瑞典政府在今年三月提出的关于暂时撤走驻在指定口岸的视察小组的建议；认为可以把它当作一项暂时措施，只要中立国监察委员会保有在需要时再派遣视察小组到每一个指定口岸的权力。六月四日，朝中方面的代表在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上提出了以上的建议，但是遭到美国的无理拒绝。其后朝鲜中立国监察委员会向军事停战委员会建议，在不改变中立国监察委员会合法地位的情况下，暂时从南北双方撤回特定口岸的视察小组，以等待停战双方对此达成协议。六月七日朝中方面在军事停战委员会提议在不改变中立国监察委员会的职权因而中立国监察委员会继续有权再派小组前往特定口岸的基础上，接受中立国监察委员会的建议；但这一合理建议竟又遭到美国的无理拒绝。同时，美国不仅不理中立国监察委员会的一致建议，而且还用最后通牒的方式命令所有驻在南朝鲜的视察小组在六月九日全部撤回非军事区。这是对于停战协定的公然的破坏，这是对于中立国家一件极不礼貌的行为。所有有正义感的人都不能不对此表示愤慨。
    关于中立国视察小组进行视察的规定是朝鲜停战协定的一个重要的组成部分，对于停战协定的实施和朝鲜停战的维持有着积极的作用。美方虽然高唱它愿意“努力维护停战的有效性”，实际上却很不欢迎中立国监察委员会的存在。停战以来，美方采取了种种手段对中立国监察委员会的工作进行破坏；从欺骗、侮辱到使用暴力，以至今天的坚决要求取消。美方认为中立国监察委员会对它是一种麻烦的“负担”，使它不能放手扩充军事力量。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福公开说，美国受到阻碍，不能“把任何现代武器或飞机运进南朝鲜”。“在我看来，我们可能不能够在现在的情况下继续无限期地遵守停战协定的条款。”
    美国方面为了掩护自己破坏停战的阴谋活动，反口诬蔑朝中方面“令人深为忧虑地”破坏了停战协定。可是，中立国监察委员会提出的全部报告都证明了朝中方面是严格遵守停战协定的各项条款的。中立国视察小组根据美方的要求，到北朝鲜各口岸进行过许多次调查，结果只能证明诽谤者的诬告完全没有根据。不久以前，中立国监察委员会的瑞士代表还对李承晚集团关于原子武器运入北朝鲜的谣言，表示“没有收到任何情报。”
    “令人深为忧虑地”破坏停战协定的恰恰就是美国自己。中立国的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员曾经查有实据地揭露过美方把大批增援性武器和军用物资运入南朝鲜的非法行为。合众社承认，美国只在今年就给南朝鲜四亿二千万美元的军事“援助”。南朝鲜的陆军从停战时的十六个战斗师增加到三十个。美国还正在为南朝鲜组织新的空军联队；在今年九月以前，交给南朝鲜的舰艇将达到二十七艘。驻在南朝鲜的美国军队“经常”保持作战状态。美国第八军军长怀特甚至公开说他的部队“能够在十五秒钟内开炮”。受到美国的这种鼓励，李承晚集团不断从汉城发出“北进”的叫嚷。
    长久以来，美国的阴谋活动已威胁着朝鲜的和平。但是需要指出，美国选择这个时候变本加厉地破坏停战协定、坚决取消中立国的视察小组绝非偶然。最近时期，整个国际局势趋向缓和，各国公众对于以合作和谅解的精神来协商解决国际问题，充满了希望和信心。在欧洲，随着苏英、苏法首脑的会谈，已为和平共处开拓了广阔的道路。在东方，随着柬埔寨的坚持和平中立政策和锡兰政治局势的改变，泰国和菲律宾也要求改变美国对它们的不平等关系。“禁运”的缺口已越来越大，寻求和民主阵营国家开展贸易的国家日益增多。美国在这样的时候采取严重威胁朝鲜停战的新行动，是企图重新制造紧张局势，转移世界公众对于国际形势趋向缓和的注意；并且，借此来压迫它的“盟国”跟着它走。有的国家在朝鲜问题上追随美国的做法，只能说明它们缺乏应有的远见。
    但是，美国这一横暴的破坏朝鲜停战的行为并不能达到它的目的。我国外交部六月十日的声明充分地表达了中国人民的严正立场。朝鲜的和平关系着亚洲和世界的和平，全世界一切爱好和平的人们，都将支持朝中方面维护中立国监察委员会和它的视察小组职权的立场，反对美国把朝鲜拖向“战争的边缘”。
