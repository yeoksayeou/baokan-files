Speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress
Speech by Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Seventh Office
The tremendous changes in the rural economy over the past year - new changes in the relationship between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between industry and agriculture
Errors and shortcomings in the agricultural cooperativization movement
Several issues that should be focused on to consolidate and improve existing cooperatives: the issue of cooperative income distribution - running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, opposing extravagance and waste - doing a good job in business management - overcoming the tendency of single production - vigorously promoting advanced experience and gradually implementing agricultural technology and farming system reforms - handling outstanding economic policy issues in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit
I agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the national budget, with Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and with Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report on the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I also suggest that the congress approve the budget and adopt the model charter for cooperatives. Now I would like to make some supplementary remarks on the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement over the past year and the work for the future.
From the Second Session to the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, the face of China's countryside has undergone fundamental changes. Since last autumn, under the timely and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the right-leaning conservative thinking in guiding agricultural cooperativization has been overcome, and a nationwide upsurge of agricultural cooperativization has emerged. The progress of the movement has been carried out on an unprecedentedly large scale and at an extraordinarily rapid pace. As of the end of May, the number of peasant households joining agricultural cooperatives has reached more than 110.13 million, accounting for 91.2% of the total number of peasant households in the country. Among them, there are more than 74.72 million households joining advanced cooperatives, accounting for 61.9% of the total number of peasant households, and more than 35.42 million households joining elementary cooperatives, accounting for 29.3% of the total number of peasant households. Therefore, agricultural production in our country has basically realized cooperativization, and the small-peasant economy has been basically transformed. It is expected that there will be another upsurge this winter and next spring, and the vast majority of provinces in the country can realize advanced cooperativization.
Due to the basic realization of agricultural production cooperativization, especially the huge increase in the proportion of advanced cooperatives, the production enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of peasants have been greatly stimulated. Therefore, with the rise of agricultural cooperativization, a nationwide production movement upsurge has also appeared. The publication of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in January this year further promoted the development of this upsurge. Many production undertakings that could not be undertaken or even dared to be imagined by individual farmers in the past are now in a position and have the possibility to be undertaken. In the short period of more than half a year from last winter to now, great achievements have been made on the agricultural production front. According to current incomplete statistics, the various farmland water conservancy projects completed nationwide, including expanding and improving irrigation areas, have reached more than 100 million mu, greatly exceeding the target to be achieved by the Fifth Five-Year Plan in 1957, and also exceeding the total irrigated area completed in the six years since the liberation of the country. In terms of accumulating natural fertilizer, most provinces have increased it by more than double compared with last year, and some provinces have increased it by two or three times. In terms of afforestation, the afforestation area last winter and this spring has also greatly exceeded the original target for this year. Some places that needed several years to complete the afforestation task in the past have completed it in one or two months or even ten days. Unprecedented achievements have been made in reforming farming systems, technical reforms, using new farm tools, and promoting improved varieties. Judging from the current situation of agricultural production: wheat and other spring-harvested crops have achieved a bumper harvest. It is estimated that the total wheat output, excluding recent disaster losses, can still reach more than 50 billion jin, an increase of more than 10% compared with last year, and it can also exceed the original plan for this year. Secondly, the spring plowing and sowing area has been expanded compared with last year, and the sowing season has also been generally earlier than in previous years. Grain and cotton have exceeded the sowing plan. Double-cropping rice has been expanded by more than 40 million mu. According to incomplete statistics from 20 provinces and cities, high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes have expanded by more than 46 million mu compared with last year. The cotton sowing area has reached more than 93 million mu, an increase of more than 6 million mu compared with last year, exceeding the plan by 1.47 million mu. Soybeans, flue-cured tobacco, sugar beets, etc. have also overfulfilled the sowing plan. If no major natural disasters occur in the future, and field management work is done well, it is entirely possible to increase production. This is the tremendous change that the rural economy has experienced since last autumn.
With the realization of agricultural cooperativization, not only has the rapid development of rural productive forces been promoted, but also new changes have been brought about in the relationship between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between industry and agriculture:
First, agricultural cooperativization has further consolidated the worker-peasant alliance. Of course, for more than 30 years, the worker-peasant alliance has always been consolidated under the leadership of our party, but the past worker-peasant alliance was based on the relationship between the social economy and the individual economy, and there were certain contradictions between these two economies. Therefore, the worker-peasant alliance was not completely consolidated. Today, the countryside has basically been cooperativized, and the future worker-peasant alliance will be established on the basis of the new socialist economy. It is conceivable that this new relationship will further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. With the realization of rural cooperativization, the unity within the peasants has also been further strengthened, and the relationship between poor and middle peasants has been closer. Their past state of dispersion and isolation has also been transformed with agricultural cooperativization, making them more closely united in the economic relationship of collective labor and common prosperity.
The further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the further unity between poor and middle peasants have also completely isolated those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements in the past. This makes it easier for us to transform rich peasants and all exploiting classes through peaceful means, and finally eliminate rural capitalism.
Second, with the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the system of exploitation and the social basis for generating the system of exploitation have been fundamentally eliminated, thereby making it possible for the vast number of peasants to embark on the road to common prosperity. In the past, peasant households were a production unit, and many people were unable to resist natural disasters, nor were they able to get rid of the exploitation of rich peasants, usurers, and speculators. Now this situation has fundamentally changed. The peasants have begun to control their own destiny. With the gradual improvement of rural productivity and the realization of agricultural mechanization in the future, they will forever get rid of the state of being exploited and being poor and backward.
Third, with the realization of cooperativization, it is also more convenient for the state to carry out unified purchase and sales. The state's implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain, industrial raw materials and certain important agricultural products is an important measure to support national industrialization and ensure the production and living needs of urban and rural people. In the past few years, the state has encountered great difficulties in implementing this measure among the vast and scattered individual peasants. Not only is the workload very large every year, but also it is not easy to figure out the production and living conditions of individual peasants in the vast ocean, and it is difficult to achieve complete fairness and rationality. This easily leads to excessive or insufficient burdens and disconnection between supply and sales, which often causes dissatisfaction among some peasants and makes their production and life difficult. In the future, with the realization of cooperativization, the individual economy will be transformed into a collective economy, from more than 110 million peasant households to 1.01 million cooperatives, and in the future it may be transformed into hundreds of thousands of cooperatives. This will make it easier for us to do a better job in unified purchase and sales, making the purchase and sales quotas more in line with the actual situation, and easier to achieve fairness, rationality, simplicity and ease of implementation. On the other hand, after paying the state's purchase tasks, the cooperatives can completely freely dispose of their surplus products, thereby making it easier to further develop the peasants' production enthusiasm and making it easier for the cooperatives to arrange their production plans more appropriately according to their needs and possibilities.
Fourth, due to agricultural cooperativization, it is also convenient to solve the living problems of the lonely, widowed, elderly, and weak. Due to the development of cooperative production and the implementation of diversified operations, it is possible to better divide labor and occupations in production, so that people with weak labor can get suitable jobs and appropriate remuneration to solve their own living problems. For those who have completely lost their labor force, with the development of production and the increase in public welfare funds, it is also possible to gradually implement the "five guarantees" so that living, old age, death and burial are all guaranteed. The "Datong World" envisioned by our ancestors: "To enable the elderly to be supported, the strong to be employed, the young to be raised, and the widowed, lonely, disabled and sick to be cared for." This ideal could only be a fantasy in the old society, but in today's world, where the people control their own destiny after the realization of cooperativization, this ideal can gradually become a reality.
In short, developing production economically, further strengthening urban-rural relations and worker-peasant relations; further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance politically, consolidating the unity of poor and middle peasants, eliminating the last social basis of capitalism in the countryside, and gradually making all peasants prosperous together, this is the fundamental change caused by the agricultural cooperativization movement in the countryside, and it is also an extremely great victory in China's socialist revolution.
The above-mentioned achievements are the dominant aspects of China's agricultural cooperativization movement in the past six months. However, on the other hand, many errors and shortcomings have also occurred in the agricultural cooperativization movement. These errors and shortcomings are mainly:
First, in the upsurge of cooperativization and the upsurge of production, cooperatives in many places once showed a phenomenon of blind extravagance and waste. Some cooperatives did not implement the central government's policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. They did not proceed from actual needs and possibilities, and prematurely and hastily organized many non-productive facilities and purchased many valuable cultural and recreational supplies. In terms of productive expenditures, they also lacked careful calculation, and prematurely and hastily built many basic constructions that were not urgently needed for current production. Some old production equipment that could have been used was left idle, and new equipment was purchased instead, wasting a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, thereby causing doubts and dissatisfaction among the vast number of members and production difficulties for the cooperatives. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly issued instructions on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, leading organs at all levels have attached importance to this issue. Judging from the current situation, these phenomena have been basically reversed, but to completely correct these shortcomings, we must continue to work hard.
Second, some cooperatives lack overall planning for production. They attach importance to increasing the production of grain and cotton, but ignore the increase in other economic crops. They attach importance to agricultural production, but ignore sideline production. In terms of labor planning, the time for individual activities of members is restricted too strictly, causing many household sideline businesses that were habitually operated by individual farmers to stagnate. Some sideline businesses that are collectively operated by cooperatives have also reduced production due to poor business management and unreasonable labor remuneration. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, although the output of rapeseed this year has increased compared with last year, it is 14% less than the planned number. According to statistics from 17 major producing areas, the sowing area of peanuts is more than 2 million mu less than planned; jute is 340,000 mu less; sugarcane is 2.6 million mu less, and silkworm production will also be reduced. In many areas, sideline production has decreased by one-third to one-half, especially pig farming, which is currently lower than the level of the same period last year in most areas. The production and harvesting of some valuable medicinal materials have also decreased. Due to the decrease in these economic crops and sideline production, the total income of the cooperatives has been greatly affected, especially the reduction in cash income, which has increased the current living difficulties of the members, and may even affect the income of the members this year. On the other hand, it also affects the balance of the social economy, affects the supply of raw materials for certain industries and handicrafts, affects export goods, and also affects the normal activities of relevant supply and transportation departments.
Third, in the process of establishing cooperatives, some cooperatives did not strictly follow the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. There were certain deviations in the implementation of policies: some cooperatives underestimated the prices of collectively owned draft animals, farm tools, trees, fruit trees, water conservancy equipment, etc., and even some means of production were transferred to the cooperatives without compensation; in individual places, the scope of collectivization was too wide, and private livestock, poultry, and scattered trees and fruit trees were mistakenly included in the cooperatives. In addition, many cooperatives adopted the wrong practice of forced investment when mobilizing members to invest, and even froze the members' savings in banks and credit cooperatives and money sent from outside, thereby causing anxiety and doubt among the members. On the contrary, they hid the money and dared not invest, and dared not buy what they wanted to buy, resulting in an abnormal phenomenon in the rural market for a period of time. Some cooperatives have not earnestly and responsibly implemented the "five guarantees", and have not given enough care and attention to the lonely, widowed, elderly, disabled and sick. These shortcomings have had an adverse impact on the consolidation and development of the cooperatives.
Fourth, in terms of the business management of cooperatives, some cooperatives still have certain chaotic phenomena. Some cooperatives do not base their production plans on objective conditions and inappropriately raise production increase targets, basing the production increase plan on unreliable foundations, so that members have no confidence in completing the production increase plan, affecting the inability to promote contracting work and output, and the inability to implement the production responsibility system. Labor organization is also not sound enough. A small number of cooperatives have not yet established fixed production teams and cultivation areas, and draft animals and farm tools have not established a fixed management and fixed use system, so the responsibility is unclear, and there are still phenomena of no one being responsible for production, idling, absenteeism, and the occurrence of livestock weakness and death. Labor quotas and labor remuneration are also not set reasonably enough. For example, the price of pig manure is too low, and the labor remuneration for certain technically demanding sideline businesses is equal to agricultural labor, which is also an important reason for the reduction of sideline production. The democratic system of some cooperatives has not yet been established, and the subjective commanding style is quite serious, which affects the unity within the community and affects the normal development of the members' production enthusiasm. Some local cooperatives are too large, spanning several townships, with thousands of households. Such a large community is not only too large in area and economically complex, creating many difficulties in management, but also because the soil fertility varies greatly between some villages, it is often easy to cause disputes between poor and rich villagers, increasing the difficulty of running the community.
Fifth, after cooperativization, all localities have paid attention to carrying out reforms in farming systems and farming techniques, such as changing single cropping to double cropping, changing dry land to paddy fields, changing sparse planting to dense planting, and selecting improved varieties and using new farm tools. These are important measures to ensure agricultural production increase and things that cooperatives can do. However, in the process of reform, there are also many places where the steps are too hasty, the plans are too large and too rigid, and there is a tendency towards generalization and administrative orders in promotion, resulting in many problems. For example, when promoting double-cropping rice in some places, there is a lack of comprehensive consideration of whether the local soil and climate are suitable, whether fertilizers and seeds are available, whether the labor force is sufficient, and whether increasing double-cropping rice will affect other crops. However, they only blindly stipulate plans and forcibly promote them on a large scale. As a result, some places cannot complete the plan, and some, although they have completed the plan, are not worth the loss from an economic accounting perspective. For example, some areas promote dry planting and dense planting, etc., but without carefully considering whether the local soil and climate are suitable and whether farmers have learned new technologies, they blindly promote them, resulting in many losses. There are also hasty situations in the promotion of double-wheel double-share plows and well digging in various places. Some places have not fully grasped the use of double-wheel double-share plows, or they can basically be used, but the plowing cattle have not gotten used to the yoke and the plowing technology has not been learned, so they rashly promote them in large quantities. As a result, the phenomenon of "hanging plows" has occurred again in some places. Some places dig wells without asking whether the geological conditions are suitable, whether the underground water source is sufficient, whether the labor and funds are sufficient, and whether there are water lifting tools after the wells are dug. They rashly set plans, mobilizing people and wasting resources. As a result, some places dig too many wells, exceeding the actual needs, and some wells cannot be used and become "watching wells". Some wells are dug, but there are no water lifting tools, so they have to "sit in the well and watch the sky". There are some similar phenomena in various places.
Some of the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors are difficult to completely avoid in large-scale movements, and some can be avoided as long as attention is paid to them subjectively in advance. Some of the errors and shortcomings are partly caused by the one-sided subjectivity, greed for more and faster results of the cadres below, and mainly caused by the overly large plans and overly urgent demands of the relevant departments above. The lack of a realistic, pragmatic spirit of adapting to local conditions and the lack of a democratic style of consulting with subordinates and the masses is an extremely important factor that leads to errors and shortcomings and makes it difficult to correct shortcomings. Our competent departments did not foresee enough beforehand, and their understanding of the situation below was not deep or timely enough, which also affected the failure to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings more quickly. This is what we should strive to correct in our future work.
At present, the countryside has basically realized cooperativization, and rural work has begun to enter a new period. In addition to continuing to absorb farmers who have not joined the cooperatives to participate in the cooperatives and continuing to upgrade the existing elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives under the principle of voluntariness, the main task in the future is to consolidate and improve this new type of socialist cooperative economy economically and politically, ensuring that the cooperatives continue to increase production and members continue to increase income, and on the basis of cooperativization, vigorously promote advanced experience, gradually implement technological reforms, and finally, with the development of national industry, realize agricultural mechanization.
In order to consolidate and improve the existing cooperatives, and continuously increase production and increase the income of members, the following issues should be focused on at present:
First, the current urgent task is to solve the problem of the distribution of cooperative income, that is, to correctly solve the relationship between the state, the cooperative and the individual members. At present, farmers are generally not suspicious of whether the cooperative can increase production in their thinking, because they have personally seen the superiority of the cooperative in production. However, there are still many concerns about whether their personal income can increase after the cooperative increases production. Therefore, the production income of the cooperative should be reasonably distributed so that agricultural tax, the public accumulation of the cooperative and the personal income of the members have an appropriate proportion. In addition to ensuring state tax revenue and the necessary public accumulation of the cooperative, it is especially important to ensure that the personal income of the members can be increased every year, so as to continue to develop the production enthusiasm of the vast number of working farmers and further consolidate the cooperative. To correctly solve the distribution problem is to correctly combine personal interests with collective interests. The state's and the cooperative's public accumulation is used to create greater happiness for the people and members, and to develop production to a higher level. This is the unity of collective interests and personal interests, long-term interests and current interests. However, if the public accumulation is increased too much and too quickly, regardless of the development of cooperative production and the current living conditions of individual members, so that members reduce their income, this will undermine the unity of personal interests and collective interests, and it will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among the masses, and the cooperative will not be consolidated. Only on the basis of appropriate increases in the income of members can appropriate public accumulation be implemented, so that members can be more concerned about collective interests and work more actively. This will not only consolidate the cooperative, but also allow more and faster accumulation of public property.
At present, it is the wheat harvest season, and this year's wheat harvest is the first product distribution after the great development of cooperatives. The quality of the distribution has great significance for consolidating the cooperative. Therefore, the principle of "less deduction and more distribution" must be adhered to in the wheat harvest distribution, and it must be ensured that the income of 90% of the members increases. Some communities with little increase in production can also appropriately reduce the public accumulation fund in order to achieve this goal. Only in this way can we greatly develop the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses and further consolidate the cooperative.
Second, to implement the central government's policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, we must mobilize the vast number of members to work diligently in production, cultivate carefully, and strive to expand the scope of production. We must develop diversified operations according to local conditions, and strive to increase production and increase income. On the other hand, we must strive to reduce expenses, oppose extravagance and waste. All non-productive construction expenditures such as cultural entertainment, health, and childcare consumption must be gradually carried out on the basis of the development of cooperative production and the increase in the personal income of members, according to actual needs, and controlled within the scope that the cooperative's public welfare fund can afford. It is forbidden to solicit donations and apportion expenses from members. Within the first one or two years of the establishment of the cooperative, all non-productive construction should be done as little as possible or not done at all. In terms of productive infrastructure construction, all long-term infrastructure construction that does not generate income in the current year must also take care of the realistic needs, distinguish between priorities and emergencies, and do what is possible. We cannot do everything at once and reach the sky in one step. Only with such careful calculation can we continuously expand the cooperative's business foundation, ensure that the lives of members are gradually improved, and make the cooperative further consolidated and improved.
Third, to do a good job in the business management of cooperatives, changing from an individual economy to a collective economy and from small-scale production to large-scale production is a huge revolution. A collective economy with large-scale production cannot be run well without comprehensive planning management, specific labor division, and an appropriate quota management system. Poor management, unclear division of labor, and excessively high or low quotas will cause losses in production. Therefore, continuously improving the business management level of cooperatives has become an important task for developing the collective economy. At present, cooperatives in various places have generally established a set of business management systems and established a certain production order, but the management level is generally not high. They must be improved at any time with the development of production. A small number of cooperatives have not established the necessary labor organization and financial management systems, and there are still phenomena such as idling, waste, and financial chaos. Such cooperatives must be rectified in a timely manner and helped to quickly compile fixed production teams, divide cultivation areas and sideline groups, formulate labor quotas, implement piece-rate remuneration, contract work and output, reward for overproduction, and livestock feeding management and use systems to avoid greater losses. The scope of the community should not be too large, and it is generally appropriate to have one community per township (referring to the original administrative township) or several communities per township. After the advanced community is built, it should be fixed for several years, and the community should not be merged every year.
Fourth, to overcome the tendency of single production in cooperatives, while ensuring the increase in grain and cotton production, we must make overall arrangements for the production of agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, horticulture, handicrafts, various sideline businesses and other economic crops in accordance with local conditions. It is very good and very important that cooperatives in various places pay attention to the production of major crops such as grain and cotton, but it is wrong to ignore the production of other economic crops and sideline businesses and must be changed. If this tendency of single production is not changed, it will inevitably affect the inability to increase or even decrease the total output value of the cooperative. As a result, the guarantee of increasing the income of 90% of the members will become empty talk, which is very unfavorable to both the community and the members. On the other hand, various economic crops and sideline products are needed for the production and life of the country and the people, and some are also export goods and raw materials for industrial and handicraft production. Each agricultural and sideline product is closely related to other production, transportation and marketing departments. The reduction of certain products will have an adverse impact on all aspects of social production and life, and even affect the balance between various sectors of the national economy. Therefore, an extremely cautious attitude must be adopted towards such a major issue as the reorganization of the rural economy. During the current transitional period of reorganization, cooperatives should encourage and organize members to continue to operate all economic crops and sideline production that have been habitually operated in various places in history and are needed by today's society, and appropriately develop them. They must never be restricted or stopped at will. As for the newly developed economic crops and sideline production, it is necessary to consider whether its natural conditions and technical conditions are suitable, whether the labor force is sufficient, whether there is a way to raise funds, and whether the operation is profitable. If these new products are completely commercial, it is also necessary to consider whether there are problems in terms of raw materials, sales, and supply, transportation and organization, so as to make an overall plan. Before making a full plan, do not blindly develop.
Fifth, we must vigorously promote advanced experience and gradually implement agricultural technology and farming system reforms. However, the promotion of each advanced experience and the reform of each farming system and production technology must be adapted to local conditions and cannot be mechanically transported regardless of local conditions. If there is not enough confidence in promoting a certain experience locally, it should be tried out in a small number of places first, and then popularized after experience is gained. The promotion of any new system and new technology will never be familiarized and accepted by the vast majority of the masses all at once. There must be a process from point to surface, from trial to popularization. The plan should be formulated appropriately and allow modifications from below. It should not be set too rigidly. Here, we must both oppose right-leaning conservative thinking and oppose the tendency of blind and rash advancement. We cannot favor one side. In some places, when promoting advanced experience and new technologies and new systems, they often disregard the experience level and technical level of the masses, and do not conduct necessary educational work. They rashly formulate large plans and take the method of simple administrative orders under the pressure of anti-rightism to forcibly promote them. As a result, they often turn good things into bad things, which should be paid great attention to.
Sixth, we must properly handle the various economic policy issues left over within the community in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit. This is an important aspect of consolidating the unity of poor and middle peasants and consolidating the cooperative. If the prices of some means of production are too low and the members have opinions, they must be seriously adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the community charter. Some scattered trees and fruit trees that farmers are unwilling to join the community should also be allowed to be privately owned in accordance with the community charter and must not be forced. For wheat planted by members themselves before joining the community, if it is stated when joining the community that whoever planted it will harvest it, it should still be allowed to be harvested by whoever planted it, and the community will extract a certain amount of public accumulation and public welfare funds. If this wheat has been harvested uniformly by the community, the original farmer must be given sufficient labor and capital costs to avoid losses. This policy must be handled with caution. Full care, appropriate arrangements and necessary care should be given to members who have lost or lack labor. In addition, the privately owned land of people living in cities must also be handled carefully in accordance with the community charter, respect their opinions, and appropriately take care of their living difficulties.

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言
    国务院副总理兼第七办公室主任邓子恢的发言
    一年来农村经济所经历的巨大变化——工农关系、城乡关系、工农业之间的关系的新的变化
    农业合作化运动中的错误和缺点
    巩固和提高现有的合作社应该着重解决的几个问题：合作社收益的分配问题——勤俭办社，反对铺张浪费——做好经营管理工作——克服生产上的单一化倾向——大力推广先进经验，逐步实行农业技术和耕作制度的改革——依照互利原则处理遗留的经济政策问题
    我同意李先念副总理关于国家预决算的报告，同意廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明，同意彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常委会的工作报告。并建议大会批准这个预决算案，通过合作社示范章程。现在我仅就一年来农业合作化运动发展情况和今后工作作一些补充发言。
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议到第三次会议的期间，我国的农村面貌起了根本性的变化。从去年秋季开始，在我党中央和毛主席及时地正确地领导下，克服了指导农业合作化方面的右倾保守思想，出现了全国性的农业合作化运动高潮，运动的进展是以空前巨大的规模和异乎寻常的速度进行的。到五月底止，全国加入农业合作社的农户，已达11，013多万户，占全国总农户的91.2％。其中加入高级社的农户，有7，472余万户，占总农户的61.9％，初级社3，542多万户，占总农户29.3％，因此我国农业生产已经基本上实现了合作化，小农经济已基本上被改造过来，预计今冬明春再有一个高潮，全国绝大多数省份都可以实现高级合作化。
    由于农业生产基本上实现了合作化，特别是高级合作社比重的巨大增长，就大大激发了广大农民的生产积极性和创造性，因此，随着农业合作化高涨的同时，全国范围内又出现了生产运动的高潮。今年一月间，全国农业发展纲要（草案）的公布，更促进了这一高潮的发展，许多过去为个体农民所不能举办，甚至不敢设想的生产事业，现在也有条件、有可能来举办了。从去年冬季到现在短短的半年多的时间内，在农业生产战线上，已经取得了巨大的成绩；据目前不完全的统计，全国完成的各项农田水利工程，连扩大和改善灌溉面积达一万万亩以上，大大超过了五年计划在1957年所要达到的指标，也超过了全国解放六年来所完成的灌溉总面积。在积自然肥方面，大多数省份比去年增加一倍以上，有些省份增加了二、三倍。在造林方面，去冬今春的造林面积，也大大超过了今年的原定指标，有的地方过去需要几年才能完成的造林任务，在一两个月内甚至十几天之内就完成了。在耕作制度改革、技术改革、使用新式农具、推广优良品种等方面都取得了空前未有的成绩。从目前农业生产的情况来看：小麦及其他春收作物已获得丰收，预计小麦总产量除最近灾害损失外估计尚可达500亿斤以上，比去年增产10％有余。比今年原订计划也可以超过。其次，春耕播种面积比去年扩大了，播种季节也普遍比往年提早了。粮食、棉花都超过了播种计划。双季稻扩大了4，000多万亩。玉米、薯类等高产作物，据20个省市不完全统计即比去年扩大4，600多万亩。棉花播种面积达9，300多万亩，比去年增加600多万亩，超计划147万亩。大豆、烤烟、甜菜等也超额完成了播种计划。今后如果不发生特大的自然灾害，并且做好田间管理工作，增加生产是完全可以肯定的。这就是从去年秋季以来农村经济所经历的巨大变化。
    随着农业合作化的实现，不仅促进了农村生产力的迅速发展，而且在工农关系、城乡关系、工农业之间的关系，也引起了新的变化：
    第一，由于农业合作化，进一步巩固了工农联盟。当然，30多年来，工农联盟在我党领导下始终是巩固的，但是过去的工农联盟是建立在社会经济与个体经济关系的基础之上，而这两种经济是存在着一定矛盾的，因此，工农联盟还不是完全巩固的，今天农村已经基本合作化，今后的工农联盟是建立在新的社会主义经济的基础上，这种新关系，将使工农联盟达到进一步的巩固，这是可以想到的。随着农村合作化的实现，也进一步加强农民内部的团结，密切了贫农和中农之间的关系，过去他们之间的分散、隔离状态，也随着农业合作化，使他们在集体劳动，共同富裕的经济关系上更加紧密地团结起来了。
    工农联盟进一步巩固，贫中农之间进一步团结，也使那些过去的地主分子、富农分子、反革命分子及其他坏分子，完全陷于孤立，这就更便于我们通过和平方法来改造富农，改造一切剥削阶级。最后地消灭农村资本主义。
    第二，随着农业合作化的实现，从根本上消灭了剥削制度和产生剥削制度的社会基础，从而就有可能使广大农民走向共同富裕的道路。过去农民一家一户就是一个生产单位，许多人无力抵抗自然灾害，也无力摆脱富农、高利贷者以及投机商人的剥削，现在这种情况已经根本改变了，农民已经开始掌握了自己的命运，他们将随着农村生产力的逐步提高和将来农业机械化的实现，永远地摆脱被剥削和贫困落后的状态。
    第三，随着合作化的实现，也更便于国家进行统购统销。国家对于粮食、工业原料及某些重要农产品实行统购统销政策是支援国家工业化，保障城乡人民生产生活需要的重要措施。几年来国家在广大的分散的个体农民中间实行这种措施是遭遇着极大困难的，不但每年工作量很大，而且对于汪洋大海一样的个体农民的生产、生活状况，也不易摸清底子，很难作到完全的公平合理，容易产生畸轻畸重和供销脱节的现象。因此，往往引起部分农民不满，使他们生产、生活感到困难。今后，随着合作化的实现，由个体经济变为集体经济，由11，000多万农户，变为101万个合作社，将来还可能变为数十万个合作社，这样就便于我们更好的做好统购统销工作，使购销定额更切合于实际情况，更易做到公平合理、简便易行。另一方面，合作社在交纳了国家征购任务以外，可以完全自由支配自己多余的产品，从而也就便于进一步发挥农民的生产积极性，便于合作社根据自己的需要和可能来更恰当地布置自己的生产计划。
    第四，由于农业合作化，也便利于解决孤寡老弱的生活问题。由于合作社生产发展，进行多种经营，能够在生产上更好的分工分业，使劳动力不强的人能够得到适宜的工作和适当的报酬，来解决他们自己的生活问题。对于完全失掉劳动力的人，随着生产的发展，公益金的增加，也有可能逐步实行“五保”，使生养死葬，都有所靠。我国古人所憧憬的“大同世界”：
  “使老有所终、壮有所用，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”，这种理想在旧社会只能是一种幻想，而在实现合作化以后人民掌握了自己命运的今天，这种理想便能够逐步变成现实。
    总之，在经济上发展生产，进一步密切城乡关系和工农业关系；在政治上进一步巩固工农联盟，巩固贫中农团结，消灭资本主义在农村中最后的社会基础，逐步使全体农民共同富裕起来，这就是农业合作化运动在农村中所引起的根本变化，也是我国社会主义革命一个极其伟大的胜利。
    以上所说的成绩，是半年多以来我国农业合作化运动中主导的方面，但另一方面，在农业合作化运动中也发生了不少错误和缺点。这些错误和缺点主要是：
    第一，在合作化高潮和生产高潮中，不少地方的合作社曾一度地出现盲目铺张浪费的现象，有些合作社没有贯彻中央所指示的勤俭办社的方针，它们不从实际的需要和可能出发，过早过急的举办许多非生产性设备，购买了许多贵重的文化娱乐用品。在生产性的开支方面，也缺乏精打细算，过早过急地兴建许多当前生产上并不急需的基本建设，有些本来还可以利用的旧的生产设备却闲置不用，而另行购置，浪费了许多人力、物力和财力，因而引起了广大社员的疑虑不满和合作社的生产困难。自中共中央和国务院联合发布了勤俭办社的指示以后，各级领导机关都重视了这一问题，从目前情况看，这些现象已基本上被扭转过来，但要彻底纠正这些缺点，还要继续努力。
    第二，有些合作社，对生产缺乏全面规划，重视了粮食和棉花的增产，而忽视其他经济作物的增产，重视农业生产，而忽视副业生产。在劳动规划上对社员个别活动的时间限制得过死，使许多习惯上由农民个体经营的家庭副业陷于停顿；有些由合作社集体经营的副业，也由于经营管理不善，劳动报酬不尽合理，致使生产减少。据农业部统计，今年的油菜籽产量虽比去年增加，但比计划数要少14％，花生据17个主要产区统计，播种面积要比计划少200多万亩；黄麻少34万亩；甘蔗少260万亩，桑蚕也要减产。许多地区副业生产下降三分之一到二分之一，特别是养猪减少，大部分地区目前还低于去年同期的水平，有些贵重的药材也减少了生产和采制。由于这些经济作物和副业生产的减少，就大大影响到合作社的总收入，特别减少了现金收入，增加了社员当前生活的困难，甚至可能影响到今年的社员收益。另一方面，也影响了社会经济的平衡，影响到某些工业和手工业的原料供应，影响到出口物资，也连带影响到有关的供销运输部门的正常活动。
    第三，在建社过程中，有些合作社没有严格地按照自愿互利的原则办事。政策执行上有一定的偏差：有些合作社，对实行公有化的耕畜、农具、林木、果树、水利设备等作价偏低，甚至某些生产资料无代价归社；个别地方实行公有化的面过宽，错误地将私有的家畜、家禽及零星的林木、果树入社。另外有不少合作社在动员社员投资时，采取了强迫投资的错误作法，甚至把社员在银行信用社的存款和外边寄来的款子也冻结起来，从而引起社员疑虑不安，反而把钱隐藏起来不敢投资，要买的东西也不敢买，致造成一个时期农村市场上的反常现象。还有的合作社没有认真负责实行“五保”，对于孤寡老弱残疾者关心不足照顾不够，这些缺点，都对合作社的巩固和发展发生了不利的影响。
    第四，在合作社的经营管理方面，有些社还存在着某些混乱现象，有些社在制定生产计划时，不根据主客观条件，不适当地提高增产指标，把增产计划建立在不可靠的基础上，致社员没有信心完成增产计划，影响到包工包产不能推行，生产责任制不能实现。在劳动组织方面也还不够健全，有少数合作社还未建立固定的生产队和耕作区，耕畜、农具也未建立起固定管理固定使用的制度，因而责任不明，生产上仍然存在着无人负责，窝工、旷工以及发生牲畜瘦弱死亡的现象。劳动定额和劳动报酬也规定得不尽合理，如猪粪作价偏低，某些技术性较高的副业劳动报酬与农业劳动相等，这也是形成副业生产减少的重要原因。有些合作社的民主制度还未确立，主观命令作风相当严重，致影响到社内团结，影响到社员的生产积极性不能正常发挥。有些地方合作社太大，地跨好几个乡，人达好几千户，这样大的社不仅地区太广，经济复杂，在管理上产生许多困难，而且有些乡村之间，因为土地肥瘠悬殊太大，往往容易发生穷乡和富乡社员之间的纠纷，增加了办社困难。
    第五，各地在合作化以后都注意进行耕作制度和耕作技术的改革，如变单季为双季，变旱地为水田，变稀播为密植，以及选用良种，改用新式农具等，这是保证农业增产的重要措施，也是合作社可能做到的事。但在改革过程中也有不少地方在步骤上要求过急，计划上订得过大过死，在推广上有一般化和行政命令的倾向，从而产生了不少毛病。譬如，有些地方在推广双季稻时，对于当地的土质、气候是否适宜，肥料种籽是否具备，劳动力是否够用，增加了双季稻是否影响其他作物等问题，缺乏全面考虑，而只是盲目地规定计划，硬性地大面积推广，结果有些地方不能完成计划，有些虽然完成了计划，但从经济核算来看则是得不偿失的。又如，有些地区推广旱播密植等，但未认真地考虑当地土质气候是否适宜，农民是否学会新的技术，便死搬硬套，冒然推广，结果也引起许多损失。各地在推广双轮双铧犁、打井等方面也存在急躁情况，有些地方使用双轮双铧犁尚没有完全把握，或者基本上可以使用，但耕牛合犋尚未习惯，掌犁技术尚未学会，便冒然大量推广，结果有些地方又一次发生了“挂犁”现象。有些地方打井不问地质条件是否适宜，地下水源是否充足，劳力资金是否够用，打井之后有无提水工具，就冒然订下计划，劳师动众，结果有些地方井打得太多，超过了实际需要，有的井不能使用，成为“看井”，有的井打起来，却无提水工具，只好
  “坐井观天”。类此现象各地都有一些。
    上述这些缺点和错误，有些是在大规模运动中难以完全避免的，有些只要主观上事先加以注意是可以避免的。有些错误和缺点部分是由于下面干部片面主观、贪多图快所致，主要的还是由于上级有关部门计划偏大，要求过急所引起的。而许多干部缺乏实事求是因地制宜的实际主义精神，缺乏遇事与下级和群众商量的民主作风，更是产生错误缺点以及缺点不易纠正的极为重要的因素。我们主管部门事前预见不够，对下面情况了解不深入不及时，也影响到上述缺点未能更迅速的纠正。这是我们在今后工作中应该努力改正的。
    目前农村已基本上实现了合作化，农村工作已开始进入了一个新的时期，今后的任务，除了继续吸收未入社的农民参加合作社，继续在自愿原则下把现有的初级社上升为高级社以外，主要就是要从经济上和政治上巩固和提高这种新型的社会主义的合作经济，保证合作社不断增产，社员不断增加收入，并且在合作化的基础上，大力推广先进经验，逐步地实行技术改革，最后随着国家工业的发展，实现农业机械化。
      为了巩固和提高现有的合作社，和不断增加生产，增加社员的收入，在当前应该着重解决以下几个问题：
    第一，当前迫切的任务是解决合作社收益的分配问题，也就是正确解决国家、合作社和社员个人之间的关系问题，当前农民在思想上，对于合作社能不能增产的问题，大致上是不怀疑的，因为他们已经亲眼看到了合作社在生产上的优越性，但是对于合作社增产之后，他们的个人收入是否能够增加，还存在着不少的顾虑，因此，对于合作社的生产收益应该进行合理的分配，使农业税、合作社的公共积累和社员个人所得，有一个恰当的比例，除了保证国家税收，和合作社必要的公共积累，特别要着重保证社员个人收入每年都能有所增加，这样才能够继续发挥广大劳动农民的生产积极性，进一步巩固合作社。正确地解决分配问题，就是要把个人利益与集体利益正确地结合起来。国家和合作社的公共积累，本是用来为人民、为社员创造更大的幸福，更高的发展生产，这就是集体利益和个人利益、长远利益和当前利益的一致性。但是，如果不顾合作社生产的发展情况，和社员个人当前生活状况，过多过快的增加公共积累，以致使社员减少收入，这就破坏了个人利益与集体利益的一致性，就势必引起群众不满，合作社也就不能巩固。只有在社员收入有适当增加的基础上，实行适当的公共积累，才可能使社员更加关心集体利益，更加积极劳动，这样不但巩固了合作社，公共财产也才能够更多更快的积累起来。
      目前正当麦收季节，今年麦收又是合作社大发展之后的第一次产品分配，分配得好坏，对于巩固合作社具有重大的意义，因此在麦收分配中必须坚持“少扣多分”的原则，必须保证90％的社员增加收入。有些增产不多的社，为了达到这个目的，也可以适当地少留公积金。只有这样才能大大发展农民群众的生产热情，进一步巩固合作社。
    第二，要贯彻执行中央所指示的勤俭办社的方针，必须发动广大社员勤劳生产，精耕细作，并努力扩大生产范围，根据当地条件，开展多种经营，力求增加生产，增加收入。另一方面，必须力求减少开支，反对铺张浪费，一切非生产性的文化娱乐、卫生、保育消费等建设开支，必须在合作社生产发展和社员个人收入增加的基础上，根据实际需要，逐步兴办，并控制在合作社公益金所能负担的范围之内，禁止向社员募捐摊派。在合作社初建的头一、二年之内，一切非生产性建设，应该尽量少办或不办。在生产性的基本建设方面，凡属当年没有收入的长期的基本建设，也须照顾现实的需要，分别轻重缓急，量力而为，不能百废俱兴，一步登天，只有这样的精打细算，才能够不断扩大合作社的经营基础，保障社员生活逐步得到改善，也才能使合作社进一步的巩固和提高。
    第三，要做好合作社的经营管理工作，从个体经济变为集体经济，从小生产变为大生产，是一个巨大的革命；大生产的集体经济，没有全面的计划管理，没有具体的劳动分工，没有适当的定额管理制度，是不可能办好的。管理不善，分工不明，定额偏高偏低，都会造成生产上的损失。为此，不断地提高合作社的经营管理水平，就成为发展集体经济的重要任务。目前各地合作社，一般的都建立了一套经营管理制度，建立了一定的生产秩序，但是管理水平一般还是不高的，必须随着生产的发展随时改进。还有少数合作社，没有建立起必要的劳动组织和财务管理制度，还存在着窝工、浪费、财务混乱等现象，对于这样的社必须及时地进行整顿，帮助他们迅速编好固定的生产队，划分耕作区和副业组，制定劳动定额，实行按件计酬，包工包产，超产奖励，和牲畜的饲养管理使用等制度，以免造成更大的损失。社的范围不宜太大，一般以一乡（指原来的行政乡）一社或一乡数社为宜。高级社建成以后应当固定若干年，不要年年并社。
    第四，克服合作社在生产上单一化的倾向，要在保证粮棉增产的同时，因地制宜地全面安排农业、林业、渔业、畜牧业、园艺业、手工业、各种副业和其他经济作物的生产。各地合作社注意了粮食、棉花等主要农作物的生产，这是很好的，也是很重要的，但是忽视其他经济作物和副业生产的情况，则是不对的，必须加以改变。这种生产单一化的倾向，如果不加改变，必然会影响合作社的总产值不能增加甚至反而减少，其结果就要使90％社员增加收入的保证成为空谈，这对于社和社员都是很不利的。另一方面，各种经济作物和副业产品，都是国家和人民生产生活所需要的，有些还是出口物资及工业、手工业生产的原料，每一种农副业产品又和其他生产、运销各部门密切联系着，某些产品的减少，对于社会生产、生活各方面都将产生不利的影响，甚至影响到国民经济各部门之间的平衡。因此，对待农村经济改组这样重大的问题，必须采取极端审慎的态度，在目前改组的过渡时期，凡是各地历史上习惯经营，而又为今天社会所需要的经济作物和副业生产，合作社应当鼓励和组织社员继续经营，并加以适当的发展，决不可随便限制或停止经营，至于新发展的经济作物和副业生产则须考虑到它的自然条件，技术条件是否适宜，劳动力是否够用，资金有无办法，经营是否有利，如果这些新产品是完全商品性的，还须考虑到原料、销路以及供销运输组织等方面有无问题，从而作出全盘规划，在没有作好全盘规划以前亦不可盲目发展。
    第五，必须大力推广先进经验，逐步实行农业技术和耕作制度的改革。但是对于每一项先进经验的推广和每一项耕作制度、生产技术的改革，必须是因地制宜，不能不看当地条件，机械搬运。在当地推行某种经验还没有十分把握的，应该先在少数地方试办，俟取得经验后，再普遍推广。任何一项新制度新技术的推广，绝不会是一下子就被广大群众所熟习，所接受，必须有一个由点到面、由试办到普及的过程。制定计划要恰当，并允许下面修改，不要定得太死。在这里既要反对右倾保守思想，又要反对盲目冒进倾向，不能偏重一边。有些地方，在推广先进经验和新技术新制度的时候，往往不顾群众的经验水平和技术水平，也没有进行必要的教育工作，就冒然制订大计划，并在反右倾的压力下采取简单行政命令的方法，硬性地加以推广，结果往往把好事变成坏事，这是应该十分注意的。
    第六，必须依照互利原则处理好社内遗留的各种经济政策问题，这是巩固贫中农团结，巩固合作社的一个重要方面。有些生产资料作价过低，社员有意见的，必须按照社章规定认真进行补课，加以调整；有些零星林木果树农民不愿意入社的也应该按照社章允许私有，不得勉强。有些地方社员在入社前自己种下的麦子，在入社时说明谁种谁收的，仍应允许谁种谁收，由社抽取一定的公积金、公益金。如果这种麦子已经由社统一收割，则须给原耕者以足够的工本费，使之不致吃亏，这种政策必须慎重处理。对丧失或缺乏劳动力的社员应当予以充分的关怀，适当的安排和必要的照顾。此外，对于家居城市人们的私有土地，也必须按照社章慎重处理，要尊重他们的意见，并适当照顾他们生活上的困难。
