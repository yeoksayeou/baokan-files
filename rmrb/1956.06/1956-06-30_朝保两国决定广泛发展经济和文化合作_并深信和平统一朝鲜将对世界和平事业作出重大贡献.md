The Bulgarian government reiterated its support for the Korean people's desire for the peaceful reunification of their homeland.

Measures for developing cultural exchanges and cooperation between the two countries have been formulated. The Bulgarian government expressed its willingness to provide assistance to Korea with goods and various materials free of charge, and a special agreement has been signed in this regard.

In assessing the international situation and the ways to resolve international disputes and further ease international tensions, the two governments expressed completely consistent views.

The two governments noted with satisfaction that, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, and other peace-loving countries, international tensions have recently eased to a certain extent, which has created more favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of disputes.

The two governments believe that international disputes should be resolved through negotiations by the countries concerned. Government representatives of both countries advocate the development of economic and cultural cooperation between countries with different social systems.
