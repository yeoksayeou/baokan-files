More Than One Hundred New Agricultural Machinery Stations to Be Built Nationwide This Year

    In order to accelerate the mechanization of cotton-growing areas, the state will establish 137 new agricultural machinery and tractor stations in cotton-growing areas and major grain-producing areas this year. At present, 42 stations have been newly established in Jiangsu, Shanxi, Qinghai, Gansu, Fujian, Shandong, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other provinces, and the remaining stations are under survey and construction. Most of these stations can be put into production during autumn and winter plowing.
    After the completion of these new stations, together with the existing stations, the country will have a total of 275 stations, an increase of nearly one-fold compared with last year. The number of tractors will increase from more than 2,300 standard units last year to more than 6,800 standard units; the service area will also expand from more than 3.29 million mu last year to 16.56 million mu, including more than 9 million mu of cotton fields, an increase of more than six and a half times compared with last year. After the completion of this year's plan, the target for the development of agricultural machinery and tractor stations in the First Five-Year Plan can be overfulfilled one year ahead of schedule.
    The original 138 agricultural machinery and tractor stations have universally launched socialist labor competitions this year, which has powerfully promoted the progress of spring plowing and production. This year, the spring plowing of each station generally started half a month earlier than last year, and the quality of operations has also been improved compared with last year. The employees have also improved their work efficiency and reduced fuel consumption in the competition.

    今年全国将新建一百多个农业机器站
    为使棉区先一步机械化，今年国家在棉区和主要产粮区要新建立137个农业机器拖拉机站。现在江苏、山西、青海、甘肃、福建、山东、陕西、江西、广东等省已经新建立了四十二个站，其余各站正在勘查和筹建中。这些站大部分可在秋耕、冬耕时投入生产。
    这些新站建成以后，加上原有的站，全国将共有275个站，比去年增加将近一倍。拖拉机由去年的二千三百多标准台增加到六千八百多标准台；服务面积也由去年329万多亩扩大到1，656万亩，其中棉田九百多万亩，比去年增加六倍半以上。今年的计划完成以后，就可以提前一年超额完成第一个五年计划发展农业机器拖拉机站的指标。
    原有的138个农业机器拖拉机站，今年普遍开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，有力地推动了春耕生产的进行。今年各站开始春耕一般较去年提前半个月，而且作业质量也较去年有所提高。职工们在竞赛中也提高了工作效率，降低了耗油量。
