Dimitar Blagoev, the most outstanding Marxist in the Balkans at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, the founder of the Bulgarian socialist movement, and the founder of the Bulgarian Communist Party, will celebrate his 100th birthday on June 14th this year. The Bulgarian people will solemnly commemorate this day.

Blagoev was born into a poor handicraft family in the village of Zagorichin, Kostur County. From an early age, Blagoev was influenced by the Bulgarian national revolutionary movement and democratic ideas. After Bulgaria was liberated from the enslavement of the Turkish Empire in 1878, he went to Russia to study. After graduating from the Odessa Middle School, he entered the University of St. Petersburg in 1880.

In St. Petersburg, Blagoev made contact with progressive Russian university students and participated in the heated Russian revolutionary activities. Here, he was influenced by the ideas of the Russian democratic revolutionaries, read the writings of the Narodniks, and studied the first volume of Marx's "Das Kapital," gradually accepting the ideas of scientific socialism. In the winter of 1883, Blagoev established one of the earliest social democratic groups in Russia in St. Petersburg, the famous "Blagoev Group." This group contacted Plekhanov's "Labor Emancipation Group" in Geneva and published the first Russian social democratic newspaper, "Worker's Gazette," in early 1885. Although Blagoev's group had not completely broken away from certain influences of the Narodniks, it played a significant role in spreading Marxism among the workers in St. Petersburg. Because of Blagoev's socialist activities, he was immediately arrested by the Tsarist police and expelled from Russia in March 1885.

After returning to Bulgaria, Blagoev dedicated his life to spreading Marxist ideas. In June 1885, he and Victoria Zhivkova (Vera Blagoeva) co-founded the first Bulgarian social democratic magazine, "Contemporary Guide." Although it was not yet a completely Marxist publication, Blagoev finally used it to unite the progressive intellectuals—the "future social democrats of Bulgaria"—around him. At this time, social democratic groups began to be established in the country. On August 2, 1891, the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party was founded under Blagoev's leadership.

The party overcame numerous difficulties in its development.

Blagoev struggled against petty-bourgeois thinkers and Narodniks who denied the necessity of spreading socialist ideas in Bulgaria at that time, because they believed that capitalism had not yet developed in Bulgaria and the working class had not yet been formed. Blagoev explained the social situation in Bulgaria at that time from a Marxist point of view. He pointed out that various conditions for socialism were gradually forming in the country.

Between 1892 and 1893, the so-called "Unionists" appeared in the Bulgarian socialist movement. The "Unionists" opposed the establishment of a social democratic party, believing that the working class could only take the path of economic struggle. In a sharp principled debate with the "Unionists," Blagoev emphasized that Bulgaria must establish a Marxist party that could lead the proletariat and ensure the proletariat's independent, socialist path of development.

However, in 1894, the Marxists headed by Blagoev took a path of compromise and merged with the "Unionists." The "Unionists" later continued their anti-party activities and became a reformist faction similar to the German Bernstein faction (the Broad Socialists). The Broad Socialists attempted to lead the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party away from its path, that is, the path of leading the proletariat, attempting to replace class struggle with class cooperation, and to disintegrate and weaken the party ranks.

Blagoev, together with his comrade Marxist fighters, exposed the petty-bourgeois, anti-popular essence of the "Broad Socialists" in theory and the treacherous tactics arising from their theories. He resolutely defended the principles of revolutionary Marxism, resolutely advocated the proletarianization of the party, resolutely advocated an irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeoisie, resolutely advocated the establishment of unity of thought and action, and resolutely advocated the implementation of conscious iron discipline within the party.

The inevitable result of this struggle was a thorough ideological and organizational split with the "Broad Socialists" and their expulsion from the party in 1903. As a result of this resolute action, the revolutionary Marxist faction headed by Blagoev formed the independent Marxist party of the working class—the Bulgarian Social Democratic Labor Party, the Narrow Socialists.

Although the Narrow Socialists were not yet a Bolshevik-style party, they were very close to Bolshevism. It constantly educated its members to be infinitely loyal to Marxism and proletarian internationalism, to have a spirit of class irreconcilability with the bourgeoisie and its lackeys, to be loyal to the proletariat, and to believe in the strength of the proletariat. The party cultivated conscious iron discipline in its ranks.

As the leader of the party, Blagoev maintained a firm and principled Marxist position. For twenty-five years, he was the editor of the party's theoretical journal "New Era" and wrote many valuable Marxist works, including "What is Socialism and Does it Have a Basis in Our Country?" (1891), "Socialism and the Bulgarian Labor Problem" (1900), and "Contribution to the History of Bulgarian Socialism" (1906). Blagoev's entire theoretical activity was inseparably linked to the party's tasks and revolutionary struggle.

Blagoev was one of the most steadfast defenders of proletarian internationalism in the international workers' movement. He tirelessly educated the members of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Labor Party (the Narrow Socialists) to maintain solidarity with the working people of all countries, and taught them that the revolutionary struggles of other peoples were also their own cause. This spirit of internationalism was particularly evident in his attitude towards the Russian Revolution. In 1911, Blagoev predicted: "The victory of the Russian Revolution will usher in an era of social revolution throughout the world."

During the First World War, Blagoev and the Narrow Socialists waged an irreconcilable struggle against social chauvinism, advocating the establishment of a new international in the spirit of revolutionary Marxism.

Blagoev greeted the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution with unparalleled excitement and enthusiasm. Under his leadership, the Narrow Socialists joined the Communist International in 1919 and changed its name to the Bulgarian Communist Party.

Blagoev passed away on May 7, 1924, when fascist terror was rampant in Bulgaria. The cause to which the pioneer of the Bulgarian socialist movement had dedicated his life had been taken up by the party's strong hands and had achieved victory. Now, this cause is continuing to be consolidated and developed in the socialist construction of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

    保加利亚社会主义运动的奠基人吉·布拉戈耶夫
    保共中央保共党史研究所所长　基里尔·瓦西列夫
    今年六月十四日，是十九世纪末二十世纪初巴尔干最杰出的马克思主义者、保加利亚社会主义运动的奠基者、保加利亚共产党的创始人吉米捷尔·布拉戈耶夫诞生一百周年。保加利亚人民将隆重纪念这个日子。
    布拉戈耶夫生于科斯土尔县札果里钦村的一个贫苦手工业家庭。从幼年起，布拉戈耶夫就受着保加利亚民族革命运动和民主主义思想的熏陶。1878年，保加利亚从土耳其帝国的奴役下获得解放之后，他到俄国去求学。读完敖德萨中学以后，他在1880年进入了彼得堡大学。
    在彼得堡，布拉戈耶夫同进步的俄国大学生取得了联系，参加了如火如荼的俄国革命活动。在这里，他受到了俄国民主革命派的思想影响，阅读了民粹派的著作，研究了马克思的“资本论”第一卷，并由此而逐渐接受了科学社会主义的思想。1883年冬，布拉戈耶夫在彼得堡建立了俄国最初的一批社会民主主义小组之一，这就是著名的“布拉戈耶夫小组”。这个小组和在日内瓦的普列汉诺夫的“劳动解放社”取得了联系，并于1885年初出版了第一份俄国社会民主主义的报纸“工人报”。布拉戈耶夫的小组虽然还没有完全脱离民粹派的某些影响，但是，它在彼得堡工人当中传播马克思主义的工作中却起了很大的作用。由于布拉戈耶夫进行社会主义活动，立刻遭到了沙皇警察的逮捕，并于1885年3月被驱逐出俄国。
    布拉戈耶夫回到保加利亚以后，将毕生精力都献给了马克思主义思想的传播事业。1885年6月他同维克多里亚·日夫科娃（维拉·布拉戈耶娃）一道创办了第一个保加利亚社会民主主义的杂志“当代指南”。虽然这还不是一个完全马克思主义的刊物，但是，布拉戈耶夫终于借此把进步知识分子——保加利亚“未来的社会民主党人”团结到自己的周围了。这时国内开始成立社会民主派小组。1891年8月2日，在布拉戈耶夫的领导下创立了保加利亚的工人的社会民主党。
    党在自己的发展过程中克服了重重的困难。
    布拉戈耶夫同小资产阶级的思想家和民粹派分子进行了斗争，这些人否认当时在保加利亚传播社会主义思想的必要性，因为，他们认为：资本主义在保加利亚尚未发展，工人阶级尚未形成。布拉戈耶夫用马克思主义的观点阐明了当时保加利亚的社会情况。他指出，社会主义的各种条件正在国内逐步形成。
    1892年—1893年间，在保加利亚社会主义运动中出现了所谓“联盟派”。“联盟派”反对建立社会民主党，认为工人阶级只能走经济斗争的道路。布拉戈耶夫在同“联盟派”所进行的尖锐的原则争论中强调指出：保加利亚必需建立一个马克思主义的党，这个党能够领导无产阶级，并保证无产阶级独立的、社会主义的发展道路。
    但是，在1894年时，以布拉戈耶夫为首的马克思主义者却走了妥协的道路，同“联盟派”合并了。“联盟派”后来继续进行了反党的活动，并独树一帜，成了类似德国的伯恩施坦分子的那种改良主义派（广泛派）。广泛派企图使保加利亚社会民主党离开它的道路，即领导无产阶级的道路，企图以阶级合作代替阶级斗争，涣散和瓦解党的队伍。
    布拉戈耶夫同自己的战友马克思主义者一道揭露了“广泛派”在理论上的小资产阶级的、反人民的本质和由他们的理论中产生出来的叛变策略。他坚决地捍卫了革命的马克思主义的原则，坚决主张党的无产阶级化、主张对资产阶级进行不调和的斗争、主张建立思想行动的统一，主张实行党内自觉的铁的纪律。
    这一斗争的必然结果，是从思想上和组织上同“广泛派”实行彻底分裂，并在1903年把他们驱逐出党。由于这一坚决行动，以布拉戈耶夫为首的革命马克思主义派，组成了工人阶级独立的马克思主义政党——保加利亚社会民主工党，即“紧密派”社会党。
      “紧密派”社会党虽然还不是布尔什维克式的党，但它很接近布尔什维克主义。它不断教育自己的成员要无限忠于马克思主义和无产阶级的国际主义、对资产阶级及其走狗要有阶级不调和的精神、要忠于无产阶级并相信无产阶级的力量。党在自己的队伍里培养了自觉的铁的纪律。
    布拉戈耶夫作为党的领导者维护了马克思主义的坚定的、原则性的立场。在二十五年期间，他一直是党的机关理论刊物“新时代”的编辑，写了许多宝贵的马克思主义的著作，其中包括“什么是社会主义以及它在我国有无基础？”（1891年），“社会主义与保加利亚的工人问题”（1900年），“对保加利亚社会主义历史的贡献”（1906年）。布拉戈耶夫的全部理论活动与党的任务及党的革命斗争有着不可分割的联系。
    布拉戈耶夫是国际工人运动中无产阶级国际主义最坚定的保卫者之一。他孜孜不倦地教育保加利亚社会民主工党（“紧密派”社会党）的党员要同各国劳动人民保持团结，并教导他们说，其他各国人民的革命斗争也就是自己的事业。这种国际主义精神特别明显地表明在对俄国革命的态度上。1911年，布拉戈耶夫曾预言过：“俄国革命的胜利将在全世界揭开社会革命的纪元”。
    第一次世界大战期间，布拉戈耶夫和“紧密派”社会党一起，同社会沙文主义进行了不调和的斗争，主张根据革命的马克思主义精神建立新的国际。
    布拉戈耶夫以无比的兴奋和热情迎接了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利。在他的领导下，“紧密派”社会党于1919年参加了共产国际，并改名为保加利亚共产党。
    1924年5月7日，在保加利亚正是法西斯恐怖猖獗的时候，布拉戈耶夫逝世了。保加利亚社会主义运动的前辈为之贡献终生的事业，已经由党的有力的手承接过来，并且取得了胜利。现在，这个事业在保加利亚人民共和国的社会主义建设中正在继续不断地巩固着和发展着。
