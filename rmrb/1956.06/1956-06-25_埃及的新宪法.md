Egypt's New Constitution

    On January 16th of this year, Egypt announced the draft of its new constitution. In May, the Egyptian cabinet decided to hold a referendum on June 23rd to adopt the new Constitution of the Republic of Egypt and elect a president.

    One of the most important principles embodied in Egypt's new constitution is that Egypt is an independent and sovereign nation. The draft of the new constitution is divided into six chapters, comprising 196 articles, excluding the preamble.

    The preamble states that the Egyptian people "will use all our efforts and abilities, with our constructive labor, to build a society that can achieve prosperity and allow the Egyptian people to complete the work of eradicating imperialism and its lackeys, eliminating feudalism, eradicating monopolies and capital's control over the government, establishing a strong national army, establishing social justice, and establishing a sound democratic life."

    Chapter Two of the constitution, "The Foundations of Egyptian Society," stipulates that social solidarity is the foundation of Egyptian society. The state guarantees the freedom, security, tranquility, and equality of all the people of Egypt. The country's national economy should be organized according to a plan based on the principles of social justice, with the aim of increasing production and raising living standards. The constitution stipulates that private enterprise is free, as long as it does not harm social interests. Capital should be used in ways that benefit the national economy. Private property shall be protected by law. The law shall stipulate the maximum amount of land ownership, and there shall be no feudal land ownership. The law shall stipulate measures to protect small land ownership and the relationship between landlords and tenants. The constitution also stipulates that the state should encourage cooperation and care for various cooperative organizations. The state should enable all citizens to have an adequate standard of living based on food supply, housing construction, public health systems, and cultural and social services. The Egyptian people have the right to receive old-age pensions and subsidies in case of illness and disability. All useful minerals, whether underground or in territorial waters, and all forms of potential energy resources are the property of the state. Public property is inviolable, and it is the responsibility of every citizen to protect public property.

    Chapter Three of the constitution, "General Rights and Obligations," stipulates that all the people of Egypt are equal before the law, and there shall be no distinction in this regard because of nationality, origin, language, religion, or belief. The constitution stipulates that no one may be arrested or detained except in accordance with the provisions of the law, that the freedom of residence of the Egyptian people may not be interfered with, and that residences may not be searched or entered. Freedom of the press, publication, and communication is guaranteed within the limits of the law, and freedom of all religions and beliefs is also guaranteed, as is freedom of expression and scientific research. The Egyptian people have the right to form associations and hold public gatherings and demonstrations in accordance with the provisions of the law. The constitution also stipulates that all the people of Egypt have the right to education, and the state guarantees that they can enjoy this right by establishing and gradually expanding a network of schools and various cultural and educational institutions. National education in state-run schools shall be conducted free of charge in stages in accordance with the provisions of the law. Elementary education is free and compulsory in state-run schools. The constitution stipulates that the Egyptian people have the right to work. The law guarantees the right to organize professional associations and trade unions. All the people of Egypt have the right to medical treatment. The constitution stipulates that the Egyptian people have the responsibility to serve in the military, pay taxes, and participate in elections in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law.

    Chapter Four of the constitution, "National Administration," stipulates that the head of state is the President of the Republic. Legislative power belongs to the National Assembly, which is composed of deputies elected by universal suffrage through secret ballot. Deputies serve a term of five years. Meetings of the National Assembly are convened and concluded by the President. Every law of the country can only take effect after being passed by the National Assembly. The government can only borrow money or assume debts that will involve treasury expenditures for the following year or several years with the approval of the National Assembly. The National Assembly may not make any amendments to the state's draft budget without the consent of the government. Any expenditure of the state exceeding the budget must be approved by the National Assembly. The President of the Republic has the right to dissolve the National Assembly, while stipulating that new parliamentary elections be held within sixty days.

    Regarding executive power, the constitution stipulates that executive power belongs to the President of the Republic. The President is elected by national referendum based on the nomination of the National Assembly. The President's term of office is six years. The head of state has the right to propose, reject, and promulgate laws. The President may issue decrees with the force of law between the two sessions of the National Assembly and during the period between the dissolution of the National Assembly and the holding of new elections. The President of the Republic serves as the commander of the armed forces, and he has the right to declare war with the consent of the National Assembly and to approve treaties, but peace treaties, armistice treaties, commercial treaties, navigation treaties, etc. shall take effect only after being approved by the Parliament. He has the right to declare a state of emergency in the country. The President has the right to submit important issues concerning the highest interests of the country to a referendum for decision after being studied by the National Assembly.

    Regarding the judiciary, the constitution stipulates that judges are independent and that they only obey the authority of the law in their trials.

    Chapter Five of the constitution, "General Provisions," stipulates the capital and flag of Egypt. The President of the Republic and the National Assembly have the right to request amendments to the constitution. However, any proposal to amend the constitution by the National Assembly must be signed by at least one-third of the deputies. Amendments to the constitution passed by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly shall be submitted to a referendum for final decision. All laws, decrees, regulations, instructions, and orders implemented before the adoption of this constitution shall continue to be valid, while allowing for their repeal or amendment in accordance with the principles and provisions of this constitution.

    Chapter Six of the constitution, "Final Provisions and Temporary Provisions," stipulates that citizens unite within the National Union, which has the right to nominate candidates for the National Assembly. The manner and form of establishing the Union shall be determined by the President.

    The draft of Egypt's new constitution reflects the achievements of its people in their struggle against imperialist oppression and feudal-monarchical reactionary rule, and in their struggle for national independence and the establishment of a republic. It is the result of the Egyptian people's struggle for freedom and independence for more than seventy years. It embodies the will of the Egyptian people against imperialism and feudalism. The new constitution is very different from the old constitution of 1923, which was entirely formulated to consolidate the ruling interests of British colonists and feudal nobles. The old constitution declared Egypt to be a "free and independent country," but it was actually in a semi-colonial and occupied position. The old constitution even expressly stipulated that the constitution would only be valid if it did not undermine "the rights enjoyed by foreigners in Egypt under law, treaties, or recognized customs."

    In July 1952, the army led by young Egyptian officers launched a revolution, overthrowing the monarchy, driving out King Farouk, dissolving the parliament, and abolishing the old constitution promulgated by the King of Egypt in 1923. In February 1953, the Egyptian government passed a temporary constitution for a three-year transition period. Now, with the promulgation of the draft of the new constitution, the transition period has ended. The adoption of the new constitution will mark the beginning of a new stage of development for the Republic of Egypt. (Hou)

    埃及的新宪法
    今年一月十六日，埃及公布了新宪法草案。五月，埃及内阁会议决定在六月二十三日举行公民投票，通过埃及共和国新宪法，并选举总统。
    埃及新宪法所体现的一个最重要的原则是，埃及是一个独立自主的国家。新宪法草案除序言外分六章，共196条。
    在序言里写道：埃及人民“将用我们的全部努力和能力，以我们的建设性劳动，来建立一个可以实现繁荣和埃及人民可以完成铲除帝国主义和它的仆从、消灭封建主义、铲除垄断以及资本对政府的控制、建立一支强大的国军、建立社会正义、建立健全的民主生活的工作的社会。”
    宪法的第二章“埃及社会的基础”中规定：社会团结是埃及社会的基础。国家保障埃及全体人民的自由、安全、安宁和平等。国家的国民经济应当根据以社会正义的原则为基础的、目的是要增加生产和提高生活水平的计划加以组织。宪法规定：私营企业是自由的，只要它不损害社会利益。资本应当用于有利于国民经济的方面。私人财产应受法律保护。法律应当规定土地所有权的最高额，不得有封建土地所有制。法律应当规定保护小土地所有权的办法和地主和佃户之间的关系。宪法还规定，国家应当鼓励合作和关怀各种合作机构。国家应当使全体公民都有以粮食供应、房屋建筑、公共卫生制度和文化社会服务为基础的充裕的生活水平。埃及人民有领取老年津贴以及在患病和残废情况下领取津贴的权利。不论在地下或是领海中的天然财富，一切有用的矿产，以及一切形式的潜在的动力资源都是国家的财产。公共财产不可侵犯，保护公共财产是每个公民的责任。
    宪法的第三章“一般权利和义务”规定，埃及全体人民在法律面前一律平等，在这方面不得因民族、出身、语言、宗教或信仰而有所不同。宪法规定：除依照法律规定外，不得逮捕或拘留任何人，不得干涉埃及人民的居住自由，不得搜查住宅和进入住宅。在法律限度内保障新闻、出版和通讯的自由，同时还保障一切宗教和信仰的自由，保证发表意见和科学研究的自由。埃及人民有权依照法律规定组织各种社团及举行公共集会和示威。宪法同时规定：埃及全体人民有受教育的权利，国家通过建立和逐步扩大学校网以及各种文化教育机构来保证使它们能够享受这种权利。国立学校中的国民教育应当按照法律规定免费分阶段进行。初等教育在国立学校中是免费的义务教育。宪法规定：埃及人民有工作权。法律保证组织同业公会和工会的权利。埃及全体人民有享受医药治疗的权利。宪法规定，埃及人民有服军役、纳赋税的责任，有依照法律规定的程序参加选举的权利。
      宪法的第四章“国家行政”规定，国家元首是共和国总统。立法权属于国民议会，议会由在普选中以不记名投票方式选出来的议员组成。议员任期五年。国民议会的会议由总统召集和结束。国家的每一条法律只有在被国民议会通过以后才能生效。政府只有经国民议会的批准才能借债或承担将牵涉到其后一年或几年的国库开支的债务。国民议会除非得到政府同意，不得对国家的预算草案进行任何修改。国家超过预算的任何开支，都必须得到国民议会的批准。共和国总统有权解散国民议会，同时规定在六十天内举行新的议会选举。
    行政权方面，宪法规定：行政权属于共和国总统。总统根据国民议会的提名，由全国公民投票产生。总统的任期为六年。国家元首有权建议、拒绝和颁布法律。总统在国民议会两届会议之间以及在国民议会解散和举行新选举之间的时期中，可以发布具有法律效力的法令。共和国总统担任武装部队司令，他有权在国民议会同意下宣战以及批准条约，但和约、停战条约、商务条约、航海条约等应得到议会的批准后才能生效。他有权在国内宣布紧急状态。总统有权在国民议会研究以后就有关国家最高利益的重要问题提交公民投票决定。
    司法方面，宪法规定，法官是独立的，他们在审判的时候只服从法律的权威。
    宪法第五章“一般规定”规定了埃及的首都、国旗。共和国总统和国民议会有权要求修改宪法。但国民议会提出修改宪法至少应有三分之一议员的签名。国民议会以三分之二多数通过的宪法修正案，应交公民投票作最后决定。在本宪法通过以前实施的一切法律、法令、条例、指示、命令继续有效，同时允许根据本宪法原则和条款加以废除或修正。
    宪法第六章“最后条款和暂时条款”中规定：公民团结在民族联盟之内，联盟有权提出国会候选人。建立联盟的方式和形式由总统规定。
    埃及的新宪法草案反映了它的人民在反对帝国主义压迫和封建—君主反动统治，以及争取民族独立和建立一个共和国的斗争中所获得的成就。它是埃及人民七十多年来争取自由独立斗争的结果。它体现着埃及人民反对帝国主义和封建主义的意志。新宪法和1923年的旧宪法截然不同，旧宪法是完全为了巩固英国殖民者和封建贵族的统治利益而制定的。旧宪法曾宣布，埃及为一个“自由独立的国家”，但它实际却处于半殖民地和被占领的地位。旧宪法甚至明文规定，只有在不破坏“外国人根据法律、条约或公认的惯例在埃及享有的权利”时宪法才是有效的。
    1952年7月，埃及青年军人领导的军队发动革命，推翻君主政体，赶走国王法鲁克，解散议会，废除了1923年埃及国王颁布的旧宪法。1953年2月，埃及政府曾通过一项三年过渡时期的临时宪法。现在，随着新宪法草案的公布，过渡时期已经结束了。新宪法的通过，将标志着埃及共和国走上一个新的发展阶段。      （厚）
