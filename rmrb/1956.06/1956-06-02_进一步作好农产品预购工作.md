Editorial:

    The pre-purchase work for agricultural products other than grain across the country has now largely come to an end. In terms of variety, the pre-purchase of cotton, tobacco leaves, tea, hemp, and silkworm cocoons has generally been done well; only the pre-purchase of ramie, a type of hemp, has been done poorly. In terms of region, the pre-purchase work in concentrated production areas has been done better, while it has been done worse in decentralized production areas. This year, in most regions, the pre-purchase funds were distributed to rural areas before spring plowing and sowing, which has played a significant role in agricultural production and has been widely welcomed by farmers, especially agricultural cooperatives.

    However, according to reports from many places, there are still many shortcomings in this year's agricultural product pre-purchase work. The main ones are: First, the allocation of pre-purchase funds has not been reasonable in some places. Some agricultural cooperatives used too much of the pre-purchase funds for production and capital construction investments, generally accounting for 80% to 95%; some agricultural cooperatives also used a considerable amount for collective non-productive expenditures, and in individual places, the funds used in this area even accounted for the majority of the pre-purchase funds. As a result, the living needs of poor farmers and farmers without cash on hand have generally not been adequately taken care of. Some agricultural cooperatives have even failed to use pre-purchase funds to care for the personal lives of their members at all, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the members. Second, some places deducted outstanding loans without a plan when distributing the pre-purchase deposit, coupled with the unreasonable allocation of pre-purchase funds, which to some extent affected the vitality of rural finance. Third, some regions and some agricultural cooperatives, due to excessive investments that could not yield profits in the current year, excessive non-productive expenditures, and some other reasons, ran out of money and resorted to reporting inflated planting areas and yields per unit area to obtain national pre-purchase deposits. For example, in Donggang Township, Hugou District, Huoshan County, Anhui Province, the reported cotton planting area was 2,700 mu, but after inspection, it was only 1,200 mu. The occurrence of this phenomenon has caused some places to compete with higher authorities for pre-purchase funds, which has affected the timely progress of the pre-purchase work; it will also inevitably lead to the falsification of agricultural product pre-purchase figures in certain places. Fourth, and particularly importantly, the signing procedures for pre-purchase contracts in many places are incomplete and not strict, resulting in many errors, such as inconsistencies in the amount of money, output, and deposit, or the absence of clear signatures and seals of responsible persons and handlers, and even cases of misidentification. These are all problems that urgently need to be solved in the current agricultural product pre-purchase work.

    Why have these problems occurred? The main reason is that the significance of this year's agricultural product pre-purchase work has not been sufficiently understood and publicized from top to bottom, and the preparatory work and organizational work have been done poorly. As a result, some cadres have taken a perfunctory attitude towards this work, failing to treat it as a major economic and political task, and simply dealing with it hastily.

    In order to effectively solve the serious problems existing in the agricultural product pre-purchase work, first of all, it is necessary to make everyone realize that the implementation of agricultural product pre-purchase is an economic link between the state and commercial departments and agricultural cooperatives and farmers, which will gradually combine the state plan with the farmers' production and sales plans. In this way, the reliability of the state plan can be continuously improved. This is of great benefit to the exchange and distribution of agricultural products and to the supply of industrial raw materials and consumers. The state pays farmers a certain percentage of agricultural product pre-purchase funds, which has two aspects of its function. On the one hand, it can help farmers solve difficulties in production and life, coupled with preferential treatment in kind such as grain and cloth, so that farmers can obtain more economic benefits, which can stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production. On the other hand, the state pre-pays farmers part of the price of agricultural products, which can avoid the phenomenon of excessive concentration of currency issuance after the autumn harvest; it can enable farmers to have money to purchase means of production and means of livelihood even in the past so-called slack season; thus, the national commercial departments can sell goods in a timely manner, and maintain a certain balance in the sale of goods in different seasons. This not only reduces the accumulation of funds for commercial departments, but also enables the circulation of goods to maintain a certain equilibrium with the production of goods. Therefore, the policy of agricultural product pre-purchase is a policy that benefits both the state and the farmers. When the state commercial departments pay farmers pre-purchase funds and sign pre-purchase contracts with them, it becomes an economic transaction between the two parties, giving agricultural cooperatives the responsibility of fulfilling the contract, and farmers will pay more attention to the production of the pre-purchased agricultural products and actively fulfill the pre-purchase contract, which is very beneficial to ensuring the smooth progress of agricultural product procurement work after the autumn harvest. Therefore, after agricultural cooperation, implementing pre-purchase of major agricultural products will be an important policy for the state in terms of agricultural product procurement, and it is also a requirement put forward by the development of the agricultural economy.

    Secondly, some agricultural product pre-purchase funds should be appropriately allocated to solve the personal living needs of some agricultural cooperative members, so that they can get the necessary currency to buy their necessities of life. This is beneficial to encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for production and enlivening the rural economy. In this regard, the State Council has recently decided to allocate another 800 million yuan as an advance payment for the unified purchase of grain, which will be distributed to farmers through agricultural cooperatives. All regions must, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, accept the experience of agricultural product pre-purchase and effectively do a good job in the distribution of advance payments.

    Furthermore, all regions with agricultural product pre-purchase tasks need to conduct a serious inspection and rectification of agricultural product pre-purchase contracts. This work should be carried out under the unified leadership and deployment of Party committees and People's Committees at all levels, with agricultural product procurement departments as the mainstay, organizing the necessary forces, relying on rural Party branches and other grassroots organizations, and focusing on the central task of production, in a planned and focused manner. It should be combined with the work of agricultural cooperatives in verifying production plans, checking the planting area and output of pre-purchase varieties, and calculating the pre-purchase quantity, pre-purchase deposit, and preferential treatment in kind. Then, under the supervision of the Party branch, the responsible persons and handlers of the agricultural cooperative or township, together with the comrades of the procurement station, will finalize the pre-purchase contract. The contract shall be submitted to the relevant authorities in accordance with the regulations. In the process of checking the contract, if the originally determined pre-purchase quantity greatly exceeds the plan, it should be revised. If there are difficulties in refunding the money after the revision, it can be solved by increasing the proportion of the pre-purchase deposit. If there are slight increases or decreases after the verification, it will generally not be changed. The pre-purchase deposits that have not yet been distributed in a few places should be distributed completely during this contract inspection, and agricultural cooperatives should be urged to use them reasonably. While checking the contract, it is necessary to understand the growth of seedlings, promote agricultural cooperatives to strengthen field management, apply fertilizer appropriately, strive to achieve production increase plans, and fulfill pre-purchase contracts. In addition, the spring tea and spring cocoons have now been launched on the market. Relevant regions should not only do a good job in the purchase of tea and silkworm cocoons, but also effectively do a good job in canceling pre-purchase contracts, and conscientiously summarize experience to further arrange the pre-purchase work in the summer and autumn seasons.

    This year's agricultural product pre-purchase quantity and pre-purchase deposit have increased significantly compared with previous years. If negligence occurs in the pre-purchase work, it will cause great losses to the state. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly publicize the significance of agricultural product pre-purchase, thoroughly inspect the signing and implementation of pre-purchase contracts, and effectively do a good job in this year's agricultural product pre-purchase and procurement work.

### 进一步作好农产品预购工作

    进一步作好农产品预购工作
    全国各地除粮食以外的农产品预购工作，目前已经大体告一段落。从品种上说，棉花、烟叶、茶叶、麻类、蚕茧的预购工作一般做得都不错；只是麻类中的苎麻预购工作作得差些。从地区上说，集中产区的预购工作作得好些，分散产区作得差些。今年绝大部分地区，预购款发放到农村的时间多在春耕播种之前，这对农业生产起了很大作用，它受到农民特别是农业社的普遍欢迎。
    但是，根据不少地方的报告，今年农产品预购的工作，也还存在着不少的缺点，主要的是：一、有些地方对农产品预购款分配得不够合理。有些农业社把预购款用于生产和基本建设投资的数字过多，一般要占80％至95％；有些农业社用于集体的非生产性的开支，也占相当的数字，个别地方用于这方面的款项，甚至占了预购款的大部分。因而，对贫苦农民和手上没有货币的农民的生活需要，普遍的照顾得非常不够，有些农业社甚至根本没有用预购款照顾社员个人的生活，以致引起社员的不满。二、有些地方在发放预购定金的时候，无计划地扣还了欠款贷款，加之预购款分配的不合理，从而在一定程度上影响了农村金融的活跃。三、有些地区和有些农业社，由于当年不能得利的投资过多，非生产性开支过大，以及其他一些原因，钱不够用了，就采取多报种植面积和单位面积产量的办法，套取国家预购定金。例如：安徽省霍山县虎口区东岗乡，上报棉田播种面积二千七百亩，经过检查只有一千二百亩。这种现象的发生，曾经使一些地方因为向上级争要预购款，而影响了预购工作的及时进行；也必然使某些地方的农产品预购数字带来虚假性。四、特别重要的是不少地方预购合同的签订手续不完备不严密，发生了很多差错，不是款数、产量、定金不相符合，就是没有切实的负责人和经手人的签名盖章，甚至发生张冠李戴的现象。这些，都是当前农产品预购工作中亟待解决的问题。
    为什么会发生上述这些问题呢？主要原因是从上到下对今年农产品预购工作的意义认识不足和宣传得不够，准备工作和组织工作做得很差。以致某些干部对这个工作采取了应付的态度，没有把它当作一项重大的经济工作和政治工作来作，只是简单从事和潦草结束。
    为了切实解决农产品预购工作中存在着的严重问题，首先必须让大家认清，实行农产品预购，是国家和商业部门同农业社和农民的一种经济上的连系，它将逐步地把国家计划同农民的生产和出售计划结合起来。这样，国家计划的可靠程度就能不断提高。这对于农产品的交换和分配，对于工业原料和消费者的供应，都有很大好处。国家付给农民一定比例的农产品预购款，有两方面的作用。一方面，可以帮助农民解决生产和生活上的困难，加上粮布等实物优待，使农民得到更多的经济利益，这就可以刺激农民的生产积极性。另一方面，国家预付给农民部分农产品价款，可以避免秋收以后货币投放过分集中的现象；可以使农民即使在过去所谓的淡季，也有钱购买生产资料和生活资料；从而可以使国家商业部门能够及时把商品销售出去，并在不同的季节使商品的售卖保持一定的平衡。这样不但商业部门减少资金的积压，而且可以使商品流转同商品的生产保持一定的均衡。因此农产品预购的政策，是国家和农民两利的政策。国家商业部门付给农民预购款，同农民签订了预购合同，就成为双方的一种经济上的交易，使农业社有了信守合同的责任，农民就会更加关心预购的农产品的生产，并积极履行预购合同，这对保证秋后农产品采购工作的顺利进行，是很有利的。因此，在农业合作化以后，对主要农产品实行预购，将是国家在农产品采购方面的一项重要政策，也是农业经济发展所提出的要求。
    其次，应该适当地拿出一些农产品预购款来解决一部分农业社社员个人的生活需要，使他们拿到必需的货币，购买自己生活上的必需品。这对鼓励农民的生产积极性，活跃农村经济，都是有好处的。在这方面，国务院最近已经决定再拨款八亿元，作为粮食统购的预付款，通过农业社发放给农民。各地务必要根据国务院的指示，接受农产品预购的经验，切实把发放预付款的工作作好。
    再就是，一切有农产品预购任务的地区，需要对农产品预购合同认真地进行一次检查和整顿。这个工作，应该在各级党委和人民委员会统一领导和部署下，以农产品采购部门为主，组织必要的力量，依靠农村党支部和其他基层组织，围绕生产的中心工作，有计划有重点地进行。应该结合农业社核实生产计划的工作，查对预购品种的播种面积和产量，并核算预购数量预购定金和优待的实物。然后在党支部的监督下，由农业社或乡的负责人和经手人，同采购站的同志把预购合同最后签定下来。并按规定将合同报送有关机关。在核对合同当中，如果原定预购数量超过计划很大，应该加以修改，假如修改后退款有困难，可从扩大预购定金比例上来加以解决。如果核对下来稍有增减，一般不再变动。少数地方尚未发放的预购定金应该在这次检查合同中发放完，并督促农业社合理地加以使用。在检查合同的同时，要了解禾苗生长的情况，推动农业社加强田间管理，适当地施肥，努力实现增产计划和履行预购合同。此外，目前春茶春茧已经上市，有关地区不仅要作好茶叶和蚕茧的收购工作，还要切实做好注销预购合同的工作，并且认真总结经验，进一步把夏秋季的预购工作加以安排。
    今年的农产品预购数量和预购定金，都比往年有很大的增加，如果在预购工作中疏忽大意，就会给国家带来很大损失。所以，必须认真宣传农产品预购的意义，深入检查预购合同的签订和执行情况，切实做好今年的农产品预购和采购工作。
