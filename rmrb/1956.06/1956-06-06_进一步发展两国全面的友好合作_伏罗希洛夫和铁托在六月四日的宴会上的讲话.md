Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: According to TASS, Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, said that the friendship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is now eternal.

At a reception held on the afternoon of June 4th for Yugoslav President Tito, Voroshilov told the guests: "Your visit to the Soviet Union and the extremely warm feelings of the Soviet people in welcoming you are a clear example of the development of friendly relations between our two countries. It has only been a year since our two peoples restored fraternal unity and mutual trust. But now it can be said that this friendship is eternal!"

The reception was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace. Voroshilov and Tito spoke one after another. The leaders of the two countries warmly toasted, and the atmosphere of the entire reception was very sincere.

In his speech, Voroshilov believed that Tito's visit to the Soviet Union is a new and powerful impetus to the further enhancement of friendly and comprehensive cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. He believed that the upcoming frank and sincere talks will be fruitful, will be a new stage in consolidating the friendship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and will help consolidate world peace.

Tito said at the reception that the extremely warm reception we received as soon as we entered Soviet territory and the welcome and attention we received in Moscow not only deeply moved us, but also made us believe that the Soviet people hold the same friendly feelings towards the Yugoslav people as the Yugoslav people hold towards them.

Tito said that the friendship between our two peoples grew up in their struggle for freedom, independence, and socialism. This friendship is particularly reflected in the struggle against fascist aggressors during the Second World War. In this struggle, the Soviet people shouldered the main burden of military operations and, together with other allies, carried the struggle to final victory. Under the leadership of its own Communist Party, the Yugoslav people also made contributions to this victory.

Tito also said that the great October Revolution led by Lenin, during the last war, just as in our previous struggles, was an inspiring example and guiding light for all ethnic groups in our country. Later, inspired by the ideas of the great October Revolution, we also began socialist construction in our country and achieved great achievements in eliminating the legacy of economic backwardness and the destruction caused by the war.

Tito emphasized that the people of our country clearly remember our mutual connections and common struggles. Therefore, we gladly welcome the Soviet government's willingness to eliminate the abnormal and harmful situation that had formed in our relations in the past and its desire to work with the Yugoslav government to seek a foundation for long-term friendly cooperation between the two countries.

In his speech, Tito expressed his belief that their visit will bring very positive results to the further consolidation and development of comprehensive friendly cooperation between the peoples of the two countries, and to the strengthening of mutual understanding and trust. He said, we are also firmly convinced that loyalty to the cause of peace and international peaceful cooperation will be fully reflected in our talks and exchange of views on general issues of current international relations. Therefore, our visit to the Soviet Union will make due contributions to safeguarding and consolidating the cause of world peace.

    进一步发展两国全面的友好合作   
    伏罗希洛夫和铁托在六月四日的宴会上的讲话
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫说，苏联同南斯拉夫的友谊现在已经是永恒的了。
    在六月四日下午为南斯拉夫总统铁托举行的招待会上，伏罗希洛夫向客人说：“你们的访问苏联和苏联人民在欢迎你们时的极其热烈的感情，是我们两国间友好关系发展的鲜明事例。我们两国人民恢复兄弟团结和相互信任以来，才只有一年。但是现在已经可以说这种友谊是永恒的了！”
    这个招待会是在大克里姆林宫中举行的。伏罗希洛夫和铁托先后讲了话。两国的领导人热烈地干杯，整个招待会的气氛是十分诚恳的。
    伏罗希洛夫在讲话中认为，铁托的访问苏联，对苏联和南斯拉夫的友好和全面合作的进一步增进，是一个新的有力的推动。他相信，即将举行的坦率和真诚的会谈，将是有成效的，将是巩固苏南两国友谊的新阶段，将有助于巩固世界和平。
    铁托在招待会上说，我们一进入苏联领土就受到的极其热烈的接待和在莫斯科受到的欢迎和注意，不但使我们深深感动，而且使我们相信，苏联人民对南斯拉夫人民同样抱着像南斯拉夫人民对他们所抱有的友好情谊。
    铁托说，我们两国人民的友情，在他们争取自由、独立和社会主义的斗争中成长起来。这种友情特别体现在第二次世界大战时期反对法西斯侵略者的斗争中。在这一斗争中，苏联人民肩负了军事行动的主要重担，同其他盟国一道把斗争进行到最后胜利。南斯拉夫人民在自己共产党的领导下，也对这个胜利作出了贡献。
    铁托又说，列宁领导的伟大的十月革命，在上次战争期间，正像在我们的以前斗争中一样，是鼓舞我国各族人民的榜样和指路标。后来我们也是在伟大十月革命的思想的鼓舞下，在我们的国家开始了社会主义建设，并且在消除遗留下来的经济落后状况和战争造成的破坏的过程中，取得了巨大的成就。
    铁托强调说，我国人民清楚地记得我们的相互联系和共同的斗争，因此，对苏联政府愿意消除我们关系中过去形成的不正常的有害的状况，愿望同南斯拉夫政府一起来寻求两国长期友好合作的基础的决心，欣然表示欢迎。
    铁托在讲话中表示相信，他们的这次访问，对进一步巩固和发展两国人民之间的全面的友好合作，对加强彼此之间的了解和信任，将带来十分积极的结果。他说，我们还坚信，对和平和国际和平合作的事业的忠诚，将充分体现在我们的会谈和就当前国际关系的一般问题的交换意见中，因而我们在苏联的访问，对保障和巩固世界和平事业将作出应有的贡献。
