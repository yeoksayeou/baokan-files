    The Economic Expansion of West German Monopoly Capital in Southeast Asia
    Wang Yu
    The re-emerging West German monopoly capital is striving to restore and expand its influence in Southeast Asia.

    In the eyes of West German monopoly capital, the Southeast Asian region is of extreme importance. Currently, 88% of West Germany's natural rubber, 100% of its tin ore, 97% of its jute, as well as chromite, manganese ore, etc., all depend on this region. On the other hand, most countries in Southeast Asia are developing their own economies and establishing industries, thus providing West Germany with the possibility of expanding sales of its machinery and other industrial products.

    Since the end of the war, West German monopoly capital has been strengthening its economic expansion activities in Southeast Asia year by year, and its activities now cover almost all countries in Southeast Asia. Of course, West German monopoly capital's expansion activities in this region are encountering fierce competition from other capitalist countries. However, West German monopoly capital has its own special advantages in this competition, such as: West German factory equipment and production technology are relatively new. Compared with other capitalist countries, the labor productivity of West German industry is relatively higher. In addition, and more importantly: West German workers work longer hours than workers in countries such as Britain, the United States, and France, while wages are relatively lower than in these countries. Because of these conditions, West Germany's economic strength has rapidly increased. West Germany's steel production already surpassed that of Britain in 1955.

    Although West Germany's trade with Southeast Asia was almost non-existent in the first few years after the war, it has recovered rapidly since 1949. By 1953, West Germany's exports to this region had increased to 250% of the 1950 level. In 1955, the total value of West Germany's trade with Southeast Asia (nearly three billion marks) was about twice that of pre-war Germany's trade with this region. At the same time, it accounted for 5%-6% of West Germany's total foreign trade, and about 20% of West Germany's overseas trade (i.e., excluding trade with continental Western Europe).

    West German monopoly capital is not satisfied with the position it has already achieved today. It is trying every possible means to expand its market. So far, West Germany has established a dense network of embassies and consulates in Southeast Asia to directly coordinate the expansion activities of West German monopoly capital. Hjalmar Schacht, a representative figure of German monopoly capital, had already toured Southeast Asia in 1951. In January of this year, West German Deputy Prime Minister Blücher visited India. In February, West German monopoly capital tycoon Krupp visited India, Ceylon, Thailand, Pakistan, and other countries. At the same time, the national organization of West German monopoly enterprises, the "Federation of German Industries," also sent a delegation to Thailand, Singapore, Burma, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia in February to investigate the possibility of West Germany further expanding its exports of goods and capital to these countries. In conjunction with these activities, the West German "East Asia Association" is also stepping up its activities. In addition, West German economic figures are brewing the establishment of institutions such as "Technical Consulting Office," "Export Bank," and "Asian Affairs Research Institute" to specifically be responsible for carrying out expansion activities in Southeast Asia. Krupp also put forward the so-called "Point Four and a Half Plan" for developing backward areas.

    India has become the largest overseas customer of West German monopoly enterprises. Before the war, the scale of German trade with India was not large, and Germany was in a deficit position. After the war, West Germany's exports to India have greatly increased. In 1955, West Germany's exports to India were seven times that of 1950. West Germany's trade surplus with India has shown a trend of expanding year by year. West German Krupp Konzern and "Deutsche Maschinenfabrik" are undertaking the construction of a large steel plant and its affiliated residential area in Orissa Province, India, using equipment as equity shares. The Krupp Cement Plant project has been completed. West German monopoly enterprises "Daimler-Benz," "Krauss-Maffei," "Robert Bosch," IG Farben's "Bayer Dye Works" and "Hoechst Dye Works," "Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz," and Siemens Konzern are all preparing to establish factories in India.

    Indonesia is the largest source of raw materials in Asia for West German monopoly enterprises. It is an important supplier of tin and natural rubber for West Germany. "Borgward Automobile and Motorcycle Factory" in Bremen has built a car assembly plant in Surabaya in the form of a joint venture with an Indonesian company, specializing in assembling Borgward brand cars. "Telefunken Ltd." has established radio assembly plants in Jakarta and Semarang. The West German government and monopoly enterprises are considering making larger-scale investments in Indonesia.

    In Pakistan, West German Krupp Konzern is building a steel plant by supplying equipment as equity. The exploration of iron ore in Pakistan is entrusted to the Krupp Konzern's exploration team. According to the contract, the state-owned "Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation" is obliged to hire experts from Krupp for advice within ten years. IG Farben's "Bayer Dye Works" and "Hoechst Dye Works" signed a contract with the Pakistani government in June 1955 on establishing a joint venture dye factory. "Pakistan Electrical Industry Co., Ltd." was designed by the West German "General Electric Company" (AEG) and produces according to the blueprints of the AEG Konzern. The Karachi Shipyard project is also contracted by a Hamburg company. West Germany's largest film Konzern, "Ufa," is currently preparing to establish a large film studio in Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan. Pakistan is an important source of cotton and jute for West Germany.

    The characteristic of West Germany's trade with Burma is West Germany's large surplus. West Germany's imports from Burma are only slightly more than one-tenth of its exports to Burma. "Deutsche Maschinenfabrik" has obtained a contract to build a steel and rolling mill near Yangon and has already started construction.

    Before 1939, Germany ranked second in Thailand's import trade, second only to Britain. After the war, this position was taken over by the United States. West German monopoly capital is trying to restore its position in Thailand. The German-Thai Treaty signed in December 1937 has been re-enacted in 1953. West Germany's exports to Thailand continue to increase, reaching a total value of 90 million marks in 1954, equivalent to twenty times West Germany's exports to Thailand in 1950. Competition among international monopoly capital groups is extremely fierce. West German capitalists complain that dollar "aid" greatly affects the allocation of import contracts by the Thai government. West Germany's trade with Thailand also has a large surplus. Thailand's main exports to West Germany are rice, rubber, and tin. In May 1955, the Thai Minister of Industry and Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram visited West Germany successively, and discussed with representatives of the West German government and economic circles the issue of West German capital "aid" for Thailand's industrial construction. The two countries also signed a so-called "Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement."

    West German monopoly capital is very interested in developing Thailand's resources (iron sand, lignite, and oil, etc.). Krupp has already proposed a plan to build a steel plant in Thailand. West German monopoly capitalists believe that they will definitely defeat the competition from Japanese monopoly capital and win this plant construction contract. Krupp is prepared to count all the machinery and complete sets of equipment it supplies as equity shares for the investment.

      Due to the strong resistance of US and British monopoly capital and the fierce competition from Japanese monopoly capital, West German monopoly capital's expansion activities in the Philippines, Ceylon, and Malaya have encountered great resistance. Although West Germany obtains important raw materials from the above three places, the import of West German goods is restricted, so West Germany's trade with the Philippines, Ceylon, and Malaya has a serious deficit phenomenon. However, West German monopoly capital is still actively trying to extend its influence to these regions. West German "Daimler-Benz" has already established a car assembly plant in the Philippines. West German monopoly capital is also preparing to use the Manila free port as a base for carrying out expansion activities in Southeast Asia. Krupp expressed his "interest in developing Ceylon's rich ilmenite" when he visited Ceylon in February this year. He also expressed his willingness to invest by supplying all the machinery and equipment needed for mining.

    The extensive economic expansion activities carried out by the resurgent West German monopoly capital in Southeast Asia have complicated and intensified the contradictions among capitalist countries in this region. As the capitalist market crisis further deepens, these contradictions will become even more acute.

    西德垄断资本在东南亚的经济扩张
    王禺
    重新崛起的西德垄断资本正在力求恢复和扩大它在东南亚的势力。
    在西德垄断资本看来，东南亚地区有极重要的意义。目前西德天然橡胶来源的88％、锡砂来源的全部、黄麻来源的97％以及铬砂、锰砂等都需要依赖这一地区。另一方面，东南亚地区大多数国家正在发展本国经济和建立工业，因而也替西德的机器和其他工业品提供了扩大销路的可能性。
    战后以来，西德垄断资本对东南亚地区的经济扩张活动逐年加强，它的活动范围目前已几乎遍布东南亚的所有国家。当然，西德垄断资本在这一地区的扩张活动是遭遇到其他资本主义国家的剧烈竞争的。但是西德垄断资本在这种竞争中有其特殊的有利条件，例如：西德工厂设备和生产技术比较新。比起其他资本主义国家来，西德工业的劳动生产率是相对地高一些。此外，更重要的是：西德工人的劳动时间比英美法等国的工人都长些，而工资则相对地低于这些国家。因为有这些条件，西德的经济实力迅速获得了增强。西德钢产量已在1955年超过英国。
    虽然战后最初几年内西德对东南亚地区的贸易几近于无，但自1949年以后却有迅速的恢复。到1953年，西德对这一地区的出口已增加到1950年的250％。1955年西德对东南亚地区的贸易总额（将近三十亿马克）相当于战前德国对这一地区贸易的两倍左右。同时它在西德对外贸易总额中所占比重已达到5％—6％，在西德海外贸易（即除去对西欧大陆的贸易之外）中已占到20％左右。
    西德垄断资本并不满足于今天所已经取得的地位。它正在千方百计地扩展它的市场。到目前为止，西德已经在东南亚地区内建立了稠密的使领馆网，直接配合西德垄断资本的扩张活动。德国垄断资本的代表人物沙赫特早于1951年就已经在东南亚巡视了一番。今年一月间西德副总理布吕希曾访问印度。二月间西德垄断资本巨头克虏伯曾访问印度、锡兰、泰国、巴基斯坦等国。与此同时，西德垄断企业的全国性组织“德国工业联合会”也在二月间派遣代表团到泰国、新加坡、缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦和印度尼西亚等国调查西德进一步开展对这些国家输出商品和资本的可能性。结合着这些活动，西德的所谓“东亚协会”也加紧活动起来。此外，西德经济界人士正在酝酿成立“技术咨询处”、“出口银行”和“亚洲问题研究所”等机构来专门负责进行对东南亚的扩张活动。克虏伯还提出了所谓开发落后地区的“第四点半计划”。
    印度已经成为西德垄断企业在海外最大的主顾。战前德国对印度的贸易规模本来不大，而且德国是处在入超地位。战后西德对印度的出口有极大的增长。1955年西德对印度的出口相当于1950年的七倍。西德对印度贸易的出超额有逐年扩大的趋势。西德克虏伯康采恩和“德意志机器公司”正在印度奥里萨省内以器材设备作为入股的股分来承建一个大型炼钢厂及其附属的住宅区。克虏伯水泥厂的工程已竣工。西德垄断企业“戴姆勒—本兹”公司、“克劳施·玛费公司”、“洛伯特波希公司”、法本集团的“拜耳染料工厂”和“霍克斯特染料公司”、“克鲁克纳—洪包特—德以兹公司”以及西门子康采恩等都正在准备在印度设厂。
    印度尼西亚是西德垄断企业在亚洲最大的原料来源。它是西德的锡和天然橡胶的重要供应者。不来梅的“波格瓦特汽车和摩托工厂”采取和印度尼西亚公司合资的方式在苏拉巴耶建起了一座汽车装配厂，专门装配波格瓦特牌汽车。“德律风肯有限公司”在雅加达和三宝垅两地设立了收音机装配工厂。西德政府和垄断企业正在考虑在印度尼西亚进行更大规模投资。
    在巴基斯坦，西德的克虏伯康采恩正在以供应器材作为入股方式来建造一座钢厂。巴基斯坦的铁矿勘探工作是委托克虏伯康采恩的勘探队来进行的。根据合同，国营的“巴基斯坦工业开发公司”在十年之内都有义务聘请克虏伯公司的专家担任顾问。法本集团的“拜耳染料工厂”和“霍克斯特染料公司”1955年6月与巴基斯坦政府签订了关于合资建立颜料厂的合同。“巴基斯坦电气工业有限公司”是由西德“通用电气公司”（AEG）设计的，并按照AEG康采恩的图纸进行生产。喀喇蚩造船厂的工程也由汉堡某公司所承包。西德最大的电影康采恩“乌发公司”目前正着手在东巴基斯坦首府达卡建立大制片厂。巴基斯坦是西德的棉花和黄麻的重要来源。
    西德对缅甸贸易的特点是西德的大量出超。西德从缅甸的进口只相当于它对缅甸出口的十分之一强。“德意志机器公司”已取得建造仰光附近的炼钢及轧钢厂的合同，并已开始动工。
    1939年以前，德国在泰国进口贸易中居第二位，仅次于英国。战后这一地位被美国占去。西德垄断资本力图恢复它在泰国的地位。1937年12月签订的德泰条约已经在1953年重新生效。西德对泰国出口不断增加，1954年时总值达到九千万马克，相当于1950年西德对泰国出口的二十倍。国际垄断资本集团间竞争异常剧烈。西德资本家抱怨美元“援助”大大影响了泰国政府进口合同的分配。西德对泰国的贸易也是大量出超。泰国对西德的主要出口货是大米、橡胶和锡。1955年5月间泰国工业部长和总理銮披汶曾先后访问西德，与西德政府及经济界代表商谈关于西德资本“援助”泰国工业建设的问题。两国并签订了所谓“经济及技术合作协定”。
    西德垄断资本对于开发泰国的富源（铁砂、褐煤和石油等）非常有兴趣。克虏伯已经提出在泰国建立钢厂的计划。西德垄断资本家认为他们定能击败日本垄断资本的竞争而争取到这一建厂合同。克虏伯公司准备把它所供应的全部机器和成套设备算作投资的股分。
      由于美英垄断资本的强力抵制和日本垄断资本的剧烈竞争，西德垄断资本在菲律宾、锡兰和马来亚三地的扩张活动受到很大的阻力。西德虽然从以上三地取得重要的原料，但西德商品的进口受到限制，因此西德对菲律宾、锡兰、马来亚的贸易有严重入超现象。但是西德垄断资本还是在积极设法要把势力伸入到这些地区去。西德“戴姆勒—本兹”公司已在菲建立一座汽车装配厂。西德垄断资本还准备利用马尼拉自由港作为开展对东南亚扩张活动的据点。克虏伯在今年二月访问锡兰时曾表示对“开发锡兰丰富的钛铁矿很感兴趣”。他还表示愿意用供应开矿所需的全部机器和设备的方式入股。
    卷土重来的西德垄断资本在东南亚所展开的广泛的经济扩张活动，引起这个地区内资本主义国家间的矛盾复杂化和尖锐化。随着资本主义市场危机的进一步加深，这种矛盾将变得更加剧烈起来。
