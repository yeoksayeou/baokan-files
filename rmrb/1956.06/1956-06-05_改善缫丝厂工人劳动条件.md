Improve the Working Conditions of Silk Reeling Factory Workers
    (Our Hangzhou Dispatch) The National Silk Reeling Factory Labor Protection Work Conference was held in Hangzhou City from May 21st to 29th. At the conference, representatives from nine provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Liaoning, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Shanghai, exchanged experiences on ventilation, cooling, dehumidification, improvement of lighting, prevention and treatment of silk reeling workers' "rotten hand" (a skin condition), and special protection for female workers in silk reeling factories. During the conference, the representatives also visited the ventilation, cooling, dehumidification, and lighting equipment of silk weaving factories such as Fuhua, Qingcheng, and Hongfeng in Hangzhou.
    The conference believed that the working conditions of silk reeling workers in our country have greatly improved in recent years. For example, working hours have been reduced from twelve hours a day before liberation to nine or eight hours; many silk reeling factories have improved workshop ventilation, cooling, and dehumidification, etc. However, at present, many silk reeling factories have excessively high temperatures and uneven lighting, resulting in phenomena such as work stoppages due to high temperatures and workers fainting.
    The conference believed that all forces should be mobilized and organized to take effective measures to improve the working conditions and living conditions of silk reeling factory workers in all aspects, to ensure the safety and health of the staff and workers, so as to ensure the smooth completion of the national plan.

    改善缫丝厂工人劳动条件
    本报杭州讯　全国缫丝厂劳动保护工作会议五月二十一日到二十九日在杭州市举行。会议主要由出席这次会议的浙江、江苏、河北、山东、安徽、辽宁、广东、四川和上海等九个省市的代表交流了缫丝工厂的通风、降温、排湿、改进灯光照明、预防和医疗缫丝工人烂手以及女工特殊保护等经验。会议期间，代表们还参观了杭州福华、庆成、鸿丰等丝织厂的通风、降温、排湿和照明设备。
    会议认为，几年来，我国缫丝工人的劳动条件已经有了很大的改善。例如工作时间由解放前的每天十二小时减少到九小时、八小时；不少的缫丝厂改进了车间通风、降温、排湿工作等。但是，目前许多缫丝厂温度过高、照明灯光强弱不匀，因此还有高温停工、工人晕倒等现象。
    会议认为，应当动员和组织一切力量，采取有效措施，从各方面来改善缫丝厂工人的劳动条件和生活条件，保障职工群众的安全健康，从而保证国家计划的顺利完成。
