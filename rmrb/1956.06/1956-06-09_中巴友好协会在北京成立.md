Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: The China-Pakistan Friendship Association was established in Beijing today. Association President Liu Geping pointed out at the inaugural meeting that this "is a manifestation of deepening the friendship between the people of China and Pakistan on a new basis." Liu Geping also expressed, "We sincerely look forward to His Excellency, Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, visiting our country soon." He said that friendly exchanges between the two countries will greatly promote mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between China and Pakistan, and further promote the spirit of the Bandung Conference.

Pakistani Ambassador to China, A.H.B. Ahmed, said at the meeting, "The Chinese people sincerely and earnestly desire peace. Your establishment of this association with such sincerity and enthusiasm lays the foundation for peace in an important region of the world."

The Pakistani journalists delegation, who were invited to visit China, attended today's inaugural meeting. Also attending the inaugural meeting were the heads and directors of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association, the heads and representatives of national people's organizations such as the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the heads of relevant ministries of the People's Republic of China, Chinese Islamic figures, people who have visited Pakistan, and people from other walks of life. Geng Biao, the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, also attended the meeting.

The meeting began after Qian Duansheng, Vice President of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association, announced the establishment of the association. Liu Geping then spoke at the meeting.

Liu Geping said that the purpose of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association is to promote cultural exchanges and friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. This purpose inherits the tradition of the long-standing cultural and friendly relations between the two countries and conforms to the common interests and demands of the people of the two countries today.

He said that China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors, and the people of the two countries have always maintained friendly relations. The people of both countries share the common desire to oppose colonialism, break away from economic backwardness, and strive for a peaceful international environment to build their own countries. These not only constitute the foundation for friendly coexistence, but also provide broad possibilities for developing economic and cultural ties and learning from each other.

Liu Geping then described the development of economic and cultural relations between China and Pakistan over the past few years, and the increasing friendship between the people of the two countries. He said that the China-Pakistan Friendship Association was born in this new development of friendly relations between China and Pakistan, and with the support of the entire Chinese people and the care and cooperation of the Pakistani people, it will work with full confidence to achieve its goals.

Next, Pakistani Ambassador to China, A.H.B. Ahmed, spoke at the meeting. He said that the establishment of this friendship association today strongly reflects the growing friendship and goodwill between the people of Pakistan and China. It means that from today onwards, the people of our two countries will have better opportunities than in the past to understand each other's culture, civilization, art, literature, and respective problems and difficulties from the perspective of the masses.

Ahmed said that he remembered at the Bandung Conference, the representatives of Pakistan and China, along with other countries, unanimously agreed and decided to take more steps to promote cultural ties between the peoples of Asian and African countries. He said that we are all moving towards a common goal, which is the goal of peace and progress. As long as we are inspired and guided by this common goal, other differences in thought will not create obstacles in the path of close cooperation between the people of our two countries.

Ahmed then traced the facts of the long-standing and developing friendly relations between Pakistan and China and congratulated the establishment of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association.

After the meeting, a tea party was held. The participants also visited the China-Pakistan Friendship Photo Exhibition. Documentary films of China and Pakistan documenting the visit of Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling to Pakistan and other events were also shown.

    中巴友好协会在北京成立
    据新华社8日讯　中国巴基斯坦友好协会今天在北京成立。协会会长刘格平在成立大会上指出，这“是在新的基础上加深中巴两国人民间友谊的表现”。刘格平还表示：“我们热诚地期待着巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里阁下能早日来我国访问。”他说，两国间的友好往来将大大促进中巴两国间的相互了解和友好合作，并且进一步发扬万隆会议的精神。
    巴基斯坦驻中国大使阿哈默德在会上说：“中国人民衷心诚意要求和平，你们以这样的真诚和热心创立了这个协会，也就是给世界上一个重要地区的和平奠定了基础。”
    应邀来访问的巴基斯坦新闻工作者访华代表团出席了今天的成立大会。出席成立大会的，还有中巴友好协会负责人和理事，中国人民对外文化协会等全国性人民团体的负责人和代表，中华人民共和国有关各部的负责人，中国伊斯兰教人士、访问过巴基斯坦人士和其他各界人士。中国驻巴基斯坦大使耿飚也出席了大会。
    大会在中巴友好协会副会长钱端升宣布协会成立后开始。刘格平接着在会上讲话。
    刘格平说，中巴友好协会是以促进中华人民共和国和巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国间的文化交流和友好关系为宗旨。这个宗旨继承了两国悠久的文化友好关系的传统，并且符合今天两国人民的共同利益和要求。
    他说，中国和巴基斯坦是友好的邻邦，两国人民间历来就保持着友好的关系。两国人民又都有反对殖民主义、摆脱经济落后、争取一个和平的国际环境来建设自己祖国的共同愿望。这些不仅构成了彼此友好相处的基础，而且提供了发展经济、文化联系及相互学习的广泛的可能性。
    刘格平接着叙述了几年以来中巴两国间经济和文化关系的发展，两国人民间友谊的日益增进等事实。他说，中巴友好协会就是在中巴两国友好关系的这种新的发展中诞生的，它将在全中国人民的支持和巴基斯坦人民的关怀与合作下，满怀信心地为达成它的宗旨而努力前进。
    接着，巴基斯坦驻中国大使阿哈默德在会上讲话。他说，今天这个友好协会成立，有力地体现着巴基斯坦和中国人民之间的友好和亲善正在增长。它意味着从今天起，我们两国人民要比过去有着更好的机会，从群众的立场来了解彼此的文化、文明、艺术、文学、各自的问题和困难。
    阿哈默德说，记得在万隆会议上，巴基斯坦和中国代表们跟其他国家一致同意并决定采取更多的步骤以促进亚非各国人民间的文化联系。他说，我们都是望着共同的目标前进，这就是和平和进步的目标。只要是在这个共同目标的鼓舞和指导下，其他思想上的不同就不能在我们两国人民密切合作的道路上造成障碍。
    阿哈默德接着追述了巴中两国悠久的和日益发展的友好关系的事实，并祝贺中巴友好协会的成立。
    会后举行了茶会。与会者还参观了中巴友好图片展览。还放映了纪录宋庆龄副委员长访问巴基斯坦等事迹的中国和巴基斯坦的纪录影片。
