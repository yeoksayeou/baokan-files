Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st. Nozaka Sanzō, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out that the conditions for establishing a Japanese national liberation democratic united front are ripe today.

Nozaka Sanzō said this in an article published in "Pravda." His article expounded on the struggle of the Japanese working people for peace, national independence, and democracy.

He pointed out the gradual leftward shift of the Japanese working people in recent years. He said that there is no doubt that the activities of the Japanese Communist Party have had a great impact on raising the awareness of the masses. More and more people are now joining the Communist Party. There are increasing calls for united action between the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party. Some Japanese national trade union organizations have suggested establishing an alliance with Socialist and Communist Party members. In the Diet, Communist, Socialist, and Labor-Farmer Party representatives are jointly fighting against anti-democratic election bills.

Nozaka Sanzō wrote that, on the one hand, we are strengthening the Party's activities, and on the other hand, we are striving for united action by national democratic forces to safeguard national independence and peace. Nozaka Sanzō mentioned in the article that in recent years, the movement to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and to demand that the government implement a foreign policy conducive to consolidating peace in Asia has greatly developed. Broad sections of the Japanese people are extremely dissatisfied with the government's delay in fulfilling its promises to the people regarding the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The broad public nationwide demands that the government immediately resume Japanese-Soviet negotiations. The same is true regarding the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The Japanese people are very clear that the lack of normal relations with these two countries runs counter to the interests of the Japanese people.

    日共中央第一书记野坂参三指出
    建立日本民主统一战线条件已经成熟
    新华社莫斯科1日电　日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三指出，建立日本民族解放民主统一战线的条件，今天已经成熟了。
    野坂参三是在发表在“真理报”上的一篇文章中这样说的。他的这篇文章阐述了日本劳动人民为和平、民族独立和民主而进行的斗争。
    他指出了近几年来日本劳动人民的逐渐左倾。他说，毫无疑问，日本共产党的活动对人民群众觉悟的提高有很大影响。现在加入共产党的人越来越多。要求日本共产党和社会党行动一致的呼声越来越高。有些日本全国性的工会组织建议建立同社会党员和共产党员的联盟。在国会中，共产党人、社会党人和劳农党代表在共同为反对反民主的选举法案而斗争。
    野坂参三写道，我们一方面加强党的活动，同时争取全国民主力量为了保障民族独立和和平而统一行动。野坂参三在文章中谈到，在最近几年中，争取日本同苏联和中华人民共和国恢复外交关系以及要求政府执行有助于巩固亚洲和平的外交政策的运动有了很大的发展。日本广大阶层人民对政府迟迟不履行自己对人民所作的关于恢复同苏联的外交关系的诺言极其不满。全国广大公众要求政府立即恢复日苏谈判。关于同中华人民共和国恢复外交关系的问题也是如此。日本人民非常清楚地知道，同这两个国家缺乏正常关系是同日本人民的利益背道而驰的。
