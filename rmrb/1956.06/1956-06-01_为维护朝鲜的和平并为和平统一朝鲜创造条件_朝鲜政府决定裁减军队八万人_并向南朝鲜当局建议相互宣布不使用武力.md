According to a broadcast today by the Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Station: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced that by August 31, 1956, the armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would be reduced by 80,000 men. Military equipment and combat materiel will be reduced accordingly.

The statement emphasized that the reason the Republic government is doing this is to maintain peace in Korea and to create more favorable conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The military expenditure saved will be used for peaceful construction and improving the people's livelihood. The state will guarantee peaceful occupations for the demobilized soldiers.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stated in the declaration that as long as the South Korean authorities do not launch a war against the northern part of the Republic, the Republic government will not use force against the South Korean authorities first.

The statement also said that the Republic government has on several occasions suggested to the South Korean authorities that they mutually declare non-use of force and reduce the military strength of North and South Korea to the minimum limit. However, the South Korean authorities have not responded to this proposal. The Republic government once again requests the South Korean authorities to respect the wishes of the Korean people and take the same practical measures in line with the people's wishes.
