After listening to Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian’s “Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget,” I found Vice Premier and Director of the State Planning Commission Li Fuchun’s “Report on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy” from the Second Session of the National People's Congress last year and compared them. This was to obtain the average planned figures for each year within the five years as a basis for studying the aforementioned final accounts and budget. After detailed analysis, I found the final accounts and budget very satisfactory. For example, Vice Premier Li Fuchun stated in his report that “the total length of new railway trunk lines and branch lines to be built within five years will be more than 4,000 kilometers,” which means that the average railway to be built each year should be 800 kilometers. In reality, as Vice Premier Li Xiannian reported, the 1955 final accounts show 1,222 kilometers of track laid, and the 1956 budget plans for 1,985 kilometers of track to be laid, both of which far exceed the average planned figure of 800 kilometers per year. To give another example, Vice Premier Li Fuchun also mentioned in his report that the annual output of raw coal within five years will "increase from 63.53 million tons to 113 million tons, an increase of 0.8 times," which means that the planned annual increase rate of raw coal is about 12%. In reality, the 1955 final accounts show that raw coal production increased by 17% compared to 1954, and the 1956 budget shows that raw coal production will increase by 17% compared to 1955, both of which also far exceed the planned increase rate of 12%. Although several light industrial products in the 1955 final accounts were slightly less than the output of 1954, this was due to temporary restrictions on raw materials and is not enough to affect our completion of the Five-Year Plan on time, just like the Beijing-Shanghai express train, which will definitely not be affected in arriving on time at the terminal station because of a few extra minutes of temporary stops along the way. In short, the 1955 revenue final account was 96.98% of the original budget, with a difference of only 3.02%, and the 1955 expenditure final account was 98.41% of the original budget, with a difference of only 1.59%, which means that the difference is within 5%, and the accuracy is above 95%. From my perspective of reviewing preliminary and final accounts in engineering for two or three decades, I feel that it is truly commendable that the difference between the final accounts and the budget is so small. Moreover, the scale of basic construction and the variety of industrial products in our country have been unprecedented in recent years, but the economic accounting system has not yet been widely promoted, and the preliminary and final accounts can be so detailed and accurate, which is really very satisfactory. Therefore, I fully agree with the 1955 final accounts, and I am even more in full agreement with the 1956 budget, and I fully support it. I hereby suggest that the congress approve and pass it.

    Fellow representatives, I am a civil engineer. Before liberation, I had served on the railway for more than 20 years. What I did every day was nothing more than stamping official seals for routine matters such as receiving materials and wages, and there were few opportunities to do some new construction projects. Therefore, at that time, even if engineers had technical skills, they had no way to use them.

    Not long after liberation, the Jinan Railway Administration sent me in January 1950 to participate in the repair project of the Huaihe and Mingguang two major bridges on the Jinpu Railway. The Communist Party trusted me so much, which made me feel very honored and made me feel that the Communist Party was my confidant friend. Therefore, although it was just liberated at that time, I never had the suspicious mentality towards the Communist Party like some engineering personnel had. At the construction site, I spent day and night with Communist Party members. In my work, I said whatever I had, and I gave whatever opinions I had. They really "listened to and followed" what I said and the opinions I raised. These two major bridges were finally completed and opened to traffic on time before the flood came under the correct leadership of the Party, with only five or six months of construction. After that, I was immediately promoted to Deputy Director of the Jinan Railway Administration, which was something I never dreamed of. Of course, according to my qualifications on the railway, it can be said that I deserve it. The problem is that in the reactionary period, without personal or sectarian relationships, it can be said that I would never be able to become the director or deputy director of the railway administration or other important positions. In 1953, I was again sent to participate in the work of new railway construction. Up to now, I have participated in the construction of the Lancun-Yantai Line, the Xiaoshan-Ningbo Line, the Wuchang-Daye Line, and the Pingdingshan Line near Luohe City in Henan Province. Some of them have been opened to traffic, and some are still under construction. In these projects, I deeply realized the rapid development of socialist construction, which was also something I never dreamed of in the past. In these past few years, the amount of new construction work I have participated in each year far exceeds the amount of projects I worked on in the 20 years before liberation. I feel that although I am an aging engineer, I still have the opportunity to participate in socialist construction projects in the Mao Zedong era, which is a great honor. In the past, after graduating from Tangshan Jiaotong University, I went to the United States to study municipal construction engineering for two years and interned in steel structure engineering for three years. I often fantasized about imitating a "professional doctor" and becoming a licensed consulting engineer. Now, even though I am an old man on the railway, my heart is still young, and I extremely hope to contribute my learned skills as much as possible. Therefore, in my spare time, I often secretly act as a "Confucian doctor"-style consulting engineer. If there are people who are "not ashamed to ask," I will do my best to serve the people with my humble knowledge. I also want to constantly enrich my knowledge in all aspects in socialist construction, and strive to learn from the advanced experience and technology of the Soviet Union, so as to better and more serve the country, so as to complete the tasks assigned to me by the superior ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota. Only then will I not fail the Communist Party's trust and promotion of me, and only then will I be worthy of being a representative of the people.

    把我所学的技术尽量贡献出来
    ——王洵才代表的发言
    我听了李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”之后，就找出去年全国人民代表大会第二次会议上李富春副总理兼国家计划委员会主任“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告”互相对阅比较，俾便求得五年内每年平均之计划数字以作为进行研究上述的决算和预算之根据，经过详细分析之后，我对于此项决算和预算觉得令人非常满意，例如李富春副总理在其报告中曾说过“五年内新建成的铁路干线和支线共四千公里以上”，这就是说每年平均要建成的铁路应在800公里之数，而实际上，则如李先念副总理所报告的1955年决算系铺轨1，222公里；1956年预算将要铺轨1，985公里，均远远超过800公里之每年平均计划数字。再举一例，李富春副总理在其报告中又曾提到五年内原煤的每年产量“从6，353万吨增加到11，300万吨，增长0.8倍”，这就是说原煤的计划产量每年递增率约系12％，而实际上，则1955年决算原煤产量较1954年增长17％，1956年预算原煤产量比1955年同样的要增长17％，亦均远远超过12％之计划递增率，虽然是在1955年决算内有数项轻工业产品比1954年的产量略为减少，乃系由于原料临时限制所致，毫不足以影响我们届时完成五年计划，犹之京沪特别快车，决不至因为在中途临时多停车数分钟而影响到达终止站之正点。总而言之，1955年之收入决算为原预算数之96.98％，相差仅3.02％，1955年之支出决算为原预算数98.41％，相差仅1.59％，这就是说其相差数均在5％以内，其准确性均在95％以上。以我二、三十年来在工程方面审核预决算的眼光来看，觉得决算与预算相差如此之微真是难能可贵，且也年来我国基本建设之广大，工业产品之繁多均系史无前例，但经济核算制度尚未普遍推行，而预决算竟能如此之细致准确，实是令人非常满意的，因此我对于1955年决算十分同意，对于1956年预算更是十分同意，并且十分拥护，谨向大会建议予以批准和通过。
    诸位代表，我是一个土木工程师，解放前我已在铁路上服务20余年，每日所作之事无非是为领材料、领工资等例行公事盖盖官章，很少有机会做些新建工程，因此那时候的工程师即使有技术本领亦无由施展。
    解放后不久，济南铁路管理局于1950年1月派我参加津浦线上的淮河明光两座大桥的修复工程，共产党竟对我如此的信任，使我感到非常光荣，并使我觉得共产党是我知己的朋友，所以尔时虽然刚刚解放，但我对共产党从无如某一些工程人员曾存有疑惧的心理，在施工地点我与共产党员日夜相处，在工作中我有甚么就说甚么，我有意见就提意见，他们对于我所说的话所提的意见，真是“言听计从”，这两座大桥终于在党的正确领导下，仅仅施工五、六个月，在洪水来到以前如限竣工通车。此后，我随即被提拔为济南铁路管理局副局长，这真是我梦想不到之事，固然按我在铁路上之资历而言，尚可以说当之无愧，问题是在反动时期若无私人或宗派等关系，可以说永远当不上铁路局的局长或副局长等要职。1953年我又被派参加新建铁路的工作，到现在为止，前后修筑蓝村烟台线、萧山宁波线、武昌大冶线、河南漯河市附近之平顶山等线，其中有已通车者，有尚正在施工者，在这些工程中我深深的体会到社会主义建设的突飞猛进，亦是我过去所梦想不到之事。在这几年来，每一年的时间，我所参加新建工程的工作量，就远远超过我在解放前工作20年的工程数量，我感到我虽是一个年岁衰老的工程师，而尚有机缘在毛泽东时代参加社会主义建设工程，真是莫大的荣幸。过去我于唐山交大毕业后，又去美国研究市政建设工程二年，实习钢材结构工程三年，时常幻想仿效“职业医生”，当一个挂牌的顾问工程师，我现在纵然已经是铁路上的老人，但我的心还是年青的，极其希望把我所学的技术尽量能贡献出来，因此在公余之暇还时常偷偷摸摸的作一个“儒医”式的顾问工程师，若是有“不耻下问”者，我必将我一得之愚尽力的为人民服务。我还要在社会主义建设中，不断充实自己各方面的知识，努力学习苏联先进经验和技术，以期更好的更多的为国家效力，以便提早和超额完成上级交给我的任务，这才不辜负共产党对我的信任和提拔，我这才不愧当一个人民的代表。
