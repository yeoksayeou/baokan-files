Xinhua News Agency, June 18th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, hosted a banquet in Beijing tonight to welcome the Japanese Asian Solidarity Committee Cultural Delegation.

　　Before the banquet, the guests and hosts had a free conversation. Guo Moruo said that the Chinese and Japanese people have many things in common, so he hoped the guests would feel at ease, as if they were at home. Guo Moruo hoped that the delegation would offer more constructive suggestions on China's cultural and artistic work. Ishikawa Tatsuzo, the head of the delegation, then said that from the moment we arrived in China, we felt very much at ease. We feel that the reason for this feeling of "ease" is due less to the long political relationship between Japan and China, and more to the long cultural relationship between the two countries; now the cultural relationship between the two countries has surpassed the political relationship.

　　The guests invited to the banquet were all seventeen members of the delegation. Also invited to the banquet were Japanese people in Beijing such as Kameda Togo, Kaneko Kenta, and Huang Fengjiu.

　　Attending the banquet as hosts were the responsible persons of the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace: Li Dequan, Liao Chengzhi, Liu Ningyi, Chen Hansheng, Zheng Senyu, etc., as well as cultural and artistic figures in Beijing such as Zheng Zhenduo, Xia Yan, Cheng Fangwu, Tian Han, Yu Pingbo, etc.

　　The delegation brought a batch of gifts to the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, as well as literary and artistic, women and children's organizations: books, paintings, photographs, handkerchiefs, records, etc. in the fields of literature and art.

　　郭沫若欢宴日本亚洲团结委员会文化代表团
    新华社18日讯　中国亚洲团结委员会主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，今天晚上在北京设宴欢迎日本亚洲团结委员会文化代表团。
    宴会前，宾主进行了自由的交谈。郭沫若说，中日两国人民有着许多共同点，所以希望客人们随便一些，好像在家里一样。郭沫若希望代表团对中国的文化艺术工作多提出些建设性的意见。代表团团长石川达三接着说，我们从到达中国的时候开始，就感到很随便了，我们觉得所以有这种“随便”的感觉，与其说是由于日中两国悠久的政治关系，毋宁说是由于两国悠久的文化关系；现在两国的文化关系已经超过了政治关系。
    应邀出席宴会的客人是代表团的全体人员共十七人。应邀出席宴会的还有在北京的日本人士龟田东伍、金子健太、黄凤九等。
    出席宴会作陪的有中国亚洲团结委员会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的负责人：李德全、廖承志、刘宁一、陈翰笙、郑森禹等，以及在北京的文化艺术界人士郑振铎、夏衍、成仿吾、田汉、俞平伯等。
    代表团带来了一批赠送给中国亚洲团结委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会以及文学艺术、妇女儿童团体的礼物：文学艺术方面的书籍、画幅、照片、手巾、唱片等。
