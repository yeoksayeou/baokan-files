French Labor Federation Basketball Team Holds First Match in Beijing

    (By our correspondent) The French Labor Sports Federation men's and women's basketball teams (hereinafter referred to as the "Labor Federation" team), which are visiting our country at our invitation, held a friendly match with a joint team of the Beijing Sports Institute and the "August 1st" men's and women's basketball teams of our country (hereinafter referred to as the "Joint Team") at the Beijing Gymnasium tonight. The "Joint Team" women's team won 73 to 42, and the men's team won 80 to 38.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the opening ceremony of the match today, and before the opening ceremony, they met with Rousseau, the leader of the French "Labor Federation" men's and women's basketball teams, deputy leaders Vignaud, referees Riel and Groslier, men's team coaches Bersan and Cremonini, and women's team coaches Servitz and Borda. Vice Premier He Long was also present at the meeting. After the match, they went to the field and shook hands with all the men and women players of the two teams and took pictures with the athletes.
    Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, delivered a welcome speech at the opening ceremony. Rousseau, the leader of the French Labor Federation men's and women's basketball teams, also spoke. Today, those who attended the opening ceremony and watched the friendly match also included: Vice Premiers of the State Council Deng Xiaoping, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairmen of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission Cai Tingkai, Cai Shufan, Lu Han, and Huang Qixiang.
    Today, the "Joint Team" men's and women's basketball teams both adopted the "fast break" tactics and the "man-to-man" defense method. In offense, they often broke through the opponent's defense line with quick movements and cut into the basket to score; the mid-range jump shots were also quite accurate. In defense, they also more effectively blocked the opponent's accurate mid-range shots. Therefore, from the beginning of the match to the end, the score has been leading. The French "Labor Federation" men's and women's basketball teams mainly adopted the offensive tactics of cross-screen, looking for gaps in the opponent's defense, rushing into the basket to shoot, and cooperating with mid-range shots; in defense, they mainly adopted the zone defense method. In the offense, they repeatedly used feints to dodge the opponent's defenders and cut into the basket, playing many beautiful balls; the zone defense was also very tight, and the ability to control the ball under the basket was very strong.
    The two games were very intense from beginning to end, and nearly 7,000 spectators in the capital watched the two games with satisfaction.
    The French "Labor Federation" men's and women's basketball teams will hold friendly matches with the "August 1st" men's and women's basketball teams at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 8th. (Attached picture)

    法国劳联篮球队在京举行首次比赛
    本报7日讯　应邀来我国访问的法国劳动体育联合会男女篮球队（以下简称“劳联”队），今晚在北京体育馆同我国北京体育学院和“八一”男女篮球队联队（以下简称“联队”）举行友谊比赛。“联队”女队以七十三比四十二、男队以八十比三十八分别获胜。
    刘少奇委员长和周恩来总理今天出席了比赛的开幕式，并且在开幕式以前接见了法国“劳联”男女篮球队领队卢梭，副领队威涅诺，裁制员列尔和格罗业尔，男子队指导贝尔桑和克雷莫尼尼，女子队指导泽尔维茨和波尔达。接见的时候，贺龙副总理也在座。在比赛终了以后，他们又到球场内和两队的全体男女队员一一握手，并和运动员们一起照了像。
    中华全国体育总会副主席荣高棠在开幕式上首先致欢迎词。法国劳联男女篮球队领队卢梭也讲了话。今天，出席开幕式和观看友谊比赛的还有：国务院副总理邓小平、乌兰夫、李富春、李先念，体育运动委员会副主任蔡廷锴、蔡树藩、卢汉和黄琪翔等。
    今天“联队”男女篮球队都采用的是“快攻”战术和“人盯人”的防守方法。进攻时经常以快速动作突破对方防线，切入篮下得分；中距离跃起投篮也相当准确。防守时也比较有效地阻挡了对方准确的中距离投篮。因此，从比赛开始到终场，分数一直领先。法国“劳联”男女篮球队都主要采取了交叉掩护、寻找对方防守空隙、冲入篮下投篮，并配合中距离投篮的进攻战术；防守时则主要采取了区域联防方法。他们在进攻中曾多次利用假动作闪过对方防守队员切入篮下，打出了不少漂亮球；区域联防的防守也非常严密，而且控制篮下球能力很强。
    两场比赛自始至终都非常紧张，首都近七千观众满意地看完了这两场球赛。
