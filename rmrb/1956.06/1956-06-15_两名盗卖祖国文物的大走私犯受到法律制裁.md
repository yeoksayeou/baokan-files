Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 14th - Two major smugglers, Ye Shuchong and Zhang Xuegeng, who helped international theft groups steal and sell large quantities of our country's precious cultural relics for export, have been successively cracked down on by public security departments. The Shanghai Second Intermediate People's Court, after a public trial, announced on the afternoon of the 12th that these two major smugglers were sentenced to fifteen years in prison.

As early as before liberation, Ye Shuchong and Zhang Xuegeng became agents in China for the "Lu Wu Company," an international group specializing in stealing and selling our country's precious cultural relics. Since 1927, Ye Shuchong had been responsible for selling more than 8,000 pieces of precious Chinese cultural relics to museums in the United States, Britain, France, Japan, Switzerland, and other countries. The portion of these sold to the United States alone was worth more than 3 million US dollars. The Shang Dynasty's Ti Liang You (wine container), of which there are only three in the entire country, had two stolen and transported abroad by him. Other rare national treasures, such as the Shang Dynasty's bronze Lei (wine container), Ya Yi, Human-Face Pot, inlaid turquoise jade Ge, the Spring and Autumn period's Zhi Junzi Jian (ancient mirror), the Warring States period's jade Bi, and Han Gan's Zhao Ye Bai (horse) painting from the Tang Dynasty, were mostly stolen and sold by him to the Freer Gallery of Art in the United States. From 1946 until the eve of liberation, Zhang Xuegeng stole and sold more than 700 precious cultural relics. After liberation, they continued their smuggling activities even more secretly. Ye Shuchong disguised valuable Northern Song Dynasty Longquan vases as cracked antiques and smuggled them to Hong Kong among ordinary antiques. Zhang Xuegeng painted precious antiques to disguise them as ordinary antiques and smuggled the ancient relics out of the country in specially made wooden objects with hidden compartments. When the public security organs cracked the Ye Shuchong case, they also found nearly 300 pieces of our country's precious cultural relics in the secret room of this major smuggler, which Ye planned to smuggle out of the country, many of which were famous bronze artifacts that had been missing for many years.

    两名盗卖祖国文物的大走私犯受到法律制裁
    新华社上海14日电　帮助国际盗窃集团大批盗卖我国珍贵文物出口的大走私犯叶叔重、张雪庚，已经先后为公安部门破获。上海市第二中级人民法院经过公开审判后在十二日下午宣布对这两名大走私犯判处十五年徒刑。
    叶叔重和张雪庚早在解放以前就成为专门盗卖我国珍贵文物的国际集团“卢吴公司”在我国的代理人。从1927年起，由叶叔重经手盗卖给美、英、法、日、瑞士等国博物馆的我国珍贵文物就有八千多件。仅以盗卖给美国的一部分计算就值三百多万美金。商代的提梁卣（盛酒器），全国只有三件，其中两件被他盗运出国。商代的古铜罍（盛酒器）、鸭彝、人面壶、嵌绿松玉戈，春秋时代的智君子鉴（古镜）、战国时代的玉璧，唐韩干画的照夜白（马）图圈等，这些稀世国宝，大都被他盗卖给美国弗里亚博物馆。张雪庚从1946年到解放前夕盗卖的珍贵文物有七百多件。解放后，他们更隐秘地继续进行盗卖活动。叶叔重把名贵的北宋龙泉瓶化妆成有裂痕的古玩混在普通古玩中运往香港。张雪庚把珍贵古玩涂上颜色化妆成普通古玩，把古文物藏在特制的夹层木器里偷运出口。公安机关破获叶叔重案的时候，还从这个大走私犯的暗室里搜出了叶犯准备盗运出口的我国珍贵文物近三百件，其中有许多是失踪多年的著名铜器。
