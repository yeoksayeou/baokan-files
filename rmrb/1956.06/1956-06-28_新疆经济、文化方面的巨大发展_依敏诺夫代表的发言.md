I completely agree with the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget presented at this conference, as well as the relevant report made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian; at the same time, I fully agree with and support the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives (Draft) and the relevant report made by Minister Liao Luyan, as well as the report on the work of the Standing Committee made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The arrangement of the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget is entirely in line with the spirit of our country's general line, and meets the requirements for the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan and the development of our various undertakings.

This final account and budget are ironclad proof of the rapid development of our country's light and heavy industries, agriculture, trade, transportation, culture, education, health, science, technology, and other undertakings, and the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards along with these developments. At the same time, this also shows the unparalleled superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system, and demonstrates the undeniable fact that we are a country fighting for peace.

Our national economy is developing healthily and rapidly on such a stable foundation, and the people of our various ethnic minorities are enjoying the fruits of these developments together with the people of the whole country. In the past, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which was economically and culturally backward compared with the interior, is now achieving tremendous development that has never been seen in history and is also impossible under the old system. These developments guarantee the gradual improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the people in our region. Encouraged by victory, the people of our region are holding a hundredfold confidence in their happy and bright future, uniting more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, further consolidating the unity among all ethnic groups, and actively striving to build a beautiful socialist society.

The development of the national economy of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is relatively rapid and healthy. The total fiscal revenue of the Autonomous Region in 1955 increased by 16.21% compared with 1954; while the 1956 revenue plan will increase by 17.78% compared with 1955. The investment in economic construction in 1955 increased by 42% compared with 1954, while 1956 will increase by 75.89% compared with 1955. There has also been great development in industrial and agricultural production. The total industrial output value in 1955 increased by 88.66% compared with 1954, while the 1956 plan will increase by 28.02% compared with 1955; the total agricultural output value (including sideline production) in 1955 increased by 12.32% compared with 1954, while the 1956 plan will increase by 11.78% compared with 1955; the total output value of animal husbandry in 1955 increased by 15.84% compared with 1954, while the 1956 plan will increase by 10.97% compared with 1955.

With the development of production, the purchasing power of the people in our region is increasing day by day, and their lives are also improving. The first Five-Year Plan of our region stipulates that the people's purchasing power will increase by one and a half times. According to the existing materials, this plan may be overfulfilled.

The transportation industry in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is also developing rapidly. Although the state-owned transportation company now has 4,976 heavy-duty trucks, it still feels that it cannot meet the actual requirements. The freight turnover in 1955 increased by 45.8% compared with 1954, while the 1956 plan will increase by 23.25% compared with 1955; the passenger turnover in 1955 increased by 30.07% compared with 1954, while the 1956 plan will increase by 114.11% compared with 1955. In 1956 alone, it is planned to build 2,450 kilometers of various highways.

The amount of investment in cultural, educational, and health undertakings is also increasing year by year. The investment in cultural, educational, and health undertakings in 1955 increased by 19.69% compared with 1954, while the 1956 plan will increase by 22.57% compared with 1955. In 1956, the number of students in universities and colleges will reach 2,161. The number of students in primary schools, secondary schools, and various vocational and technical schools will reach 450,000. In terms of health undertakings, taking hospital beds as an example, 1955 increased by 54.35% compared with 1954, while the 1956 plan will increase by 16% compared with 1955, with a total of 6,732 beds. Our region is building a modern medical college, which is also large-scale in the country, with 3,000 students and a 500-bed clinical hospital. It will start enrolling students this year, which is one of the great achievements in the medical and health undertakings of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Since the second half of last year, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, great progress has been made in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industrial and commercial enterprises. Our region has basically completed the primary collectivization of agriculture, and will basically realize advanced collectivization this winter and next spring. The socialist transformation of handicrafts and private industrial and commercial enterprises has also been basically completed. This is a major transformation in which the economic components of the Autonomous Region have undergone fundamental changes. This transformation has made the production enthusiasm of the people of the Autonomous Region even higher. It has created extremely favorable conditions for accelerating the development of various production undertakings. Undoubtedly, in the future, various production undertakings in our region will develop at a faster speed.

The struggle against conservatism instructed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has promoted various tasks in our region and improved the work enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees. The progress of various tasks has met our development requirements and the needs of the people. Therefore, we feel that the struggle against conservatism has been carried out properly and in a timely manner.

The railway is getting closer and closer to our region, which has infinitely inspired and excited the people of all ethnic groups. The people are eagerly looking forward to the completion of the railway with unparalleled enthusiasm. We must greet the completion of the railway with practical actions to further develop various production undertakings, especially to prepare for economic construction. With the completion of the railway, our Autonomous Region will have a greater possibility to make greater contributions to national construction with its Karamay oil, various metal mineral seedlings, high-quality cotton, and other products. This makes all of us feel infinitely excited.

While we have achieved many achievements in various tasks in our region, many shortcomings and even individual errors have also occurred. These shortcomings have been pointed out in the reports and speeches of Vice Premier Chen Yun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Deng Zihui, and ministers of various ministries. Therefore, I do not intend to repeat them here. There are many reasons for the emergence of these shortcomings, one of the main reasons being the shortcomings and errors in the leadership style of the people's committees at all levels (of course, including the people's committee of the Autonomous Region). In the leadership style of the people's committees at all levels, there are problems such as unrealistic and unspecific leadership, failure to promptly investigate and study the situation below, failure to promptly pay attention to correcting problems found, poor work planning; failure to creatively improve the leadership style to adapt to the requirements of objective development, and even individual cadres are satisfied with their past achievements in their work and think that the work is basically good, while ignoring some shortcomings in the work, not enthusiastic about the people's cause, and a lack of a sense of responsibility cannot be said to be non-existent. In order to overcome the shortcomings in our work, we still need to make our best efforts to further improve the work and leadership style of all cadres, and further improve and enhance their enthusiasm, creativity, and sense of responsibility.

    新疆经济、文化方面的巨大发展
    ——依敏诺夫代表的发言
    我完全同意在这次大会上提出的1955年国家决算和1956年的国家预算，及李先念副总理所作有关的报告；同时，也完全同意并拥护高级农业生产合作社示范章程
  （草案）和廖鲁言部长所作有关的报告，以及彭真副委员长关于常务委员会工作的报告。
    1955年国家决算与1956年国家预算的安排，是完全符合于我国总路线的精神，符合于胜利完成第一个五年计划和我们各项事业发展的要求。
    这个决算和预算是我国轻重工业、农业、贸易、交通运输、文教卫生、科学、技术等各项事业飞速发展和随着这些发展而人民物质文化生活水平日益提高的铁证。同时这也说明社会主义经济制度无可比拟的优越于资本主义经济制度，和显示我们是一个为和平而斗争的国家的无可否认的事实。
    我国国民经济在这样稳定的基础上，健康地、飞速地发展着，我们各少数民族人民正在同全国人民共同的享受着这些发展的成果。过去，在经济、文化方面比关内地区较为落后的新疆维吾尔自治区，正在取得历史上从未有过而且也不可能有的巨大发展。这些发展，保证了我区人民物质和文化生活水平的逐步提高。被胜利所鼓舞着的我区人民，对自己幸福美好的前途抱着百倍信心，更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，进一步巩固各民族间的团结，为建设美好的社会主义社会而积极地奋斗着。
    新疆维吾尔自治区国民经济的发展是比较迅速而健康的。自治区1955年的财政总收入比1954年增长了16.21％；而1956年收入计划将比1955年增长17.78％。1955年经济建设的投资比1954年增长了42％，而1956年比1955年将增长75.89％。在工农业生产方面，也有了很大的发展。1955年工业总产值比1954年增长了88.66％，而1956年计划将比1955年增长28.02％；农业总产值（包括副业生产）1955年比1954年增长了12.32％，而1956年计划将比1955年增长11.78％；畜牧业生产总值1955年比1954年增长了15.84％，而1956年计划将比1955年增长10.97％。
    随着生产的发展，我区人民的购买力日益提高，生活也在改善着，我区第一个五年计划规定人民购买力将增长一倍半，根据现有的许多材料来看，这一计划，可能超额完成。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的交通运输业也在迅速发展中。现在国营运输公司虽有4，976辆载重货车，但也感到满足不了实际要求。货运周转量1955年比1954年增长了45.8％，而1956年计划将比1955年增长23.25％；客运周转量1955年比1954年增长了30.07％，而1956年计划将比1955年增长114.11％。仅仅在1956年一年内就计划修建各种公路2，450公里。
    文化、教育、卫生事业的投资额也在逐年增长。1955年文教卫生事业的投资，较1954年增长了19.69％，而1956年计划将比1955年增长22.57％。1956年高等学校学生人数将达到2，161名。小学、中等学校和各种专业技术学校学生人数将达到45万名。在卫生事业方面，单拿病床来说，1955年较1954年增长了54.35％，而1956年计划将比1955年增长16％，床位将达到6，732张。我区正在修建在全国范围来说也是规模较大，将拥有3，000名学员和500个床位的临床医院的现代化医学院。并于今年开始招收学员，这是新疆维吾尔自治区医疗卫生事业方面的巨大成就之一。
    自去年下半年起，根据党中央和毛主席的指示，在对农业、手工业和私营工商业进行社会主义改造方面有了很大的进展，我区已基本上完成了农业的初级合作化，今冬明春将基本上实现高级合作化，手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造工作也已基本上完成。这是自治区经济成份发生了根本变化的大转变。这个转变使自治区人民的生产热情更加高涨。为加速发展各项生产事业，创造了极为有利的条件。无疑地，今后我区各项生产事业将会以更快的速度发展起来的。
    党中央和毛主席指示的反对保守主义的斗争，推动了我区各项工作，提高了广大职工的工作积极性和创造性。各项工作的进展，满足了我们的发展要求和人民的需要。因此，我们觉得反对保守主义的斗争，进行得很妥当和适时。
    铁路日益接近我区，这使各民族人民无限的鼓舞和兴奋，人民群众以无比的热情渴望着铁路的修通。我们要为进一步发展各项生产事业，特别是为经济建设做好准备的实际行动来迎接铁路的修通。随着铁路的修通，使我们自治区，有了更大的可能以自己的克拉玛依石油、各种金属矿苗、品质优良的棉花和其他产品，为国家建设作出更大的贡献。这使我们大家都感到无限的兴奋。
    在我区各项工作上获得了许多成绩的同时，也发生了不少缺点，甚至个别的错误。这些缺点，在陈云副总理，李先念副总理、邓子恢副总理、各部部长的报告和发言中，均已指出。因而，我不打算在这里重复它们。这些缺点的产生，是有许多原因的，其中主要原因之一，是各级人民委员会（当然也包括自治区人民委员会）的领导作风上的缺点和错误。在各级人民委员会的领导作风上，存在着领导的不实际，不具体，不能及时调查和研究下面的情况，不及时地注意纠正发现的问题，工作计划性差；不能适应客观发展的要求来创造性的改进领导作风，甚至个别干部以
  自己工作中已得的成绩对照过去而自满，以为工作基本上是好的，而忽视工作中的某些缺点，不热心于人民事业，责任心不够等现象也不能说没有。为了克服工作中的缺点，我们还需要尽最大的努力，进一步改进全体干部的工作和领导作风，更加提高和增强他们的积极性、创造性和责任心。
