Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 4th. Former Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk arrived in Warsaw by plane on the afternoon of June 3rd, at the invitation of the State Council and Government of the People's Republic of Poland.

　　After disembarking from the plane, Sihanouk met with Polish Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nowak, Speaker of the Parliament Dębowski, Vice-Chairman of the State Council Ignar, Foreign Minister Rapacki, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Poland.

　　After Nowak delivered a welcoming speech, Sihanouk gave a reply. He expressed his hope that his visit to Poland would be fruitful for both countries.

　　Sihanouk said, "We Cambodians are very pleased to accept the de jure recognition of our country by Poland and other People's Democratic countries. You undoubtedly know that we are currently pursuing a policy of complete neutrality. We feel particular sympathy for your great nation. Our small kingdom is situated between two powerful and belligerent neighbors. Our situation in Asia is similar to Poland's situation in the past."

　　"We know what war is, we know the evils it brings, therefore, although we are not afraid of war, we hate it. Today, our kingdom is a democratic country. It practices socialism, a socialism that is not dogmatic, but is itself an experimental socialism."

　　"We are currently striving to improve the status of the common people, reduce the importance of feudal lords, and we are fighting against social injustice, poverty, and ignorance."

　　Sihanouk said that the Cambodian people, through the National Congress, have become a decisive factor in the country's domestic and foreign policy. This is a real revolution for a country that was under autocratic rule just ten years ago.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 4th. Polish Chairman of the State Council Zawadzki and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, received former Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk on the 3rd, who is visiting Poland at their invitation.

    西哈努克应波兰政府邀请到达华沙
    f波兰国家领导人接见西哈努克
    新华社华沙4日电　柬埔寨前首相西哈努克亲王，应波兰人民共和国国务委员会和政府的邀请，六月三日下午乘飞机到达华沙。
    西哈努克下飞机以后，同波兰部长会议第一副主席诺瓦克、议会议长邓博夫斯基和国务委员会副主席伊格纳尔、外交部长拉帕茨基，以及各国驻波兰的外交使节见了面。
    在诺瓦克致了欢迎词以后，西哈努克致答词。他表示希望他这次访问波兰对两国都有收获。
    西哈努克说，我们柬埔寨人十分满意地接受了波兰和其他人民民主国家所给予我们国家的法律上的承认。你们无疑地知道，我们目前正在执行完全中立的政策。我们特别感到同情你们伟大的国家。我们的弱小的王国处在两个强大而好战的邻国中间，我们在亚洲所处的这种情况，同过去波兰所处的情况相同。
    我们知道战争是什么，我们知道它所带来的恶事，因此，虽然我们不怕战争，却恨恶它。今天，我们的王国是一个民主的国家。它实行社会主义，这种社会主义不是教条的社会主义，它本身是一种实验的社会主义。
    我们目前正在努力提高老百姓的地位，降低封建主的重要性，我们正在向社会不正义、贫困和无知进行斗争。
    西哈努克说，我国人民通过国民代表大会，成为国家的国内政策和外交政策中的具有决定性的因素。对于一个不过在十年前还处在专制统治之下的国家说来，这是一种真正的革命。
    新华社华沙4日电　波兰国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基和部长会议主席西伦凯维兹，在三日接见了应邀到波兰访问的柬埔寨前首相西哈努克亲王。
