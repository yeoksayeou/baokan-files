The following communiqué was transmitted by the State Statistical Bureau of the People's Republic of China.

In 1955, profound changes took place in China's national economy. The growth rate of various sectors of the national economy, especially light industrial production and retail commerce, slowed down somewhat compared with previous years, mainly due to the impact of the major floods in the previous year. After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, due to the criticism and correction of right-leaning conservative ideas, hundreds of millions of farmers in our country responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture was set off; the cooperation of handicrafts and the joint state-private ownership of the entire capitalist industry and commerce also entered a high tide; the national economy also began to show a new upsurge. Now, the situation of the major departments in the past year is published in the communiqué as follows:

(1) Growth of Industrial Production, Improvement of
Technical Level, and Socialist Transformation of Private Industry

The basic situation of industrial production in 1955 was: heavy industrial production continued to develop significantly, and light industrial production grew slower due to insufficient supply of agricultural raw materials; compared with 1954, the production of means of production increased by 17%, and the production of consumer goods increased by only 1%.

In 1955, the total industrial output value of the country (excluding cooperative handicrafts and individual handicrafts, same below) completed 101% of the plan, of which the state-owned industry completed 108% of the plan. The percentages of total output value plans completed by each industrial ministry were: Ministry of Electric Power Industry 102, Ministry of Coal Industry 104, Ministry of Petroleum Industry 109, Ministry of Heavy Industry 106, Ministry of First Machine Building Industry 110, Ministry of Textile Industry 101, and Ministry of Light Industry 106.

In 1955, the total industrial output value of the country increased by 8% compared with 1954, of which: state-owned industry increased by 15%, cooperative industry increased by 35%, joint state-private industry increased by 41%, and private industry decreased by 30% (mainly because a large number of private industries were transformed into joint state-private ownership).

In 1955, among the 45 major industrial products of the national industry included in the Five-Year Plan, 37 completed or overfulfilled the state plan, and the other 8 did not complete the plan. Among these 45 products, except for two new products, the output of 31 products increased to varying degrees compared with 1954, and the output of the other 12 products decreased compared with 1954 due to reasons such as raw material supply restrictions, unsuitable products, and insufficient estimation of needs (although the number of metal cutting machine tools decreased, the tonnage increased). The output of 20 particularly important industrial products is now listed as follows:

Product Name	Unit	Actual Output in 1955	Compared with 1954 (%)
Electricity	Million kWh	12,278	112
Raw Coal	Thousand Tons	93,604	117
Crude Oil	Thousand Tons	966	122
Pig Iron	Thousand Tons	3,630	123
Steel	Thousand Tons	2,853	128
Steel Products	Thousand Tons	2,505	128
Soda Ash	Thousand Tons	405	130
Ammonium Sulfate	Thousand Tons	324	109
Cement	Thousand Tons	4,503	98
Generators	Thousand kW	108	197
Metal Cutting Machine Tools	Units	13,708	86
Locomotives	Units	98	188
Freight Cars	Units	9,258	170
Double-Wheel Double-Share Plows	Thousand Units	523	873
Cotton Yarn	Thousand Pieces	3,968	86
Cotton Cloth	Million Bolts	103	84
Automobile Tires	Thousand	593	85
Paper	Thousand Tons	589	106
Sugar	Thousand Tons	410	118
Cigarettes	Thousand Cases	3,567	96

In 1955, the technical level of industrial production continued to improve. Various industrial departments successfully trial-produced many new types of products, including major ones such as: 10,000 kW automated hydro-generators and hydro-turbines, 6,000 kW condensing steam turbines, 40-ton/hour evaporation boilers and other large-scale power equipment; 90-ton/hour sintering machines, 2.4-meter diameter axial flow fans for mines, coke pushers and other heavy mining and metallurgical equipment; universal shapers, single-axis automatic lathes and other 59 new types of metal cutting machine tools; grain combine harvesters, 48-row seeders, five-share plows and other agricultural implements; 50 kg/meter steel rails, alloy seamless steel pipes for the petroleum industry, various alloy steels and shaped steels for automobile manufacturing, silicon steel sheets for motor manufacturing, steel plates for shipbuilding, etc.

In 1955, many advanced work experiences emerged in various industrial departments. The main technical and economic indicators improved compared with 1954: the standard coal consumption rate for power generation decreased by 2.4%, the raw coal recovery rate increased by 4%, the mechanization level of coal mining working faces increased by 16.8%, the utilization rate of blast furnace effective volume increased by 7.9%, the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces increased by 17.7%, and the raw material consumption per unit product of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rubber products, and cigarettes also decreased.

In 1955, the product costs of state-owned industrial enterprises and key local state-owned industrial enterprises of various industrial ministries decreased by 8% compared with 1954. Due to the increase in production and the reduction in the cost of industrial products, various industrial ministries completed 110% of the industrial profit plan in 1955. However, some industrial enterprises had insufficient understanding of comprehensive conservation and had biases such as one-sided conservation of raw materials, only focusing on quantity, and neglecting product quality.

In 1955, as the state began to implement joint state-private ownership of the entire capitalist industry, the proportion of socialist and semi-socialist industries continued to grow. In the total industrial output value of the country, state-owned industry accounted for 63%, cooperative industry accounted for 5%, joint state-private industry accounted for 16%, and private industry accounted for only 16%. In the total output value of private industry, the value of products processed, ordered, purchased, marketed, and acquired by the state accounted for 82%.

In 1955, handicraft cooperative organizations achieved further development. There were more than 64,000 handicraft production cooperative organizations with 2.2 million employees, accounting for 29% of the total number of handicraft employees, up from 15% in 1954. The total output value of cooperative handicrafts increased by approximately 72% compared with 1954. The total output value of individual handicrafts decreased by 13% compared with 1954 after deducting the already cooperative part.

(2) Growth of Agricultural Production and Socialist Transformation of Agriculture

In 1955, China's socialist transformation of agriculture took a big step forward, and agricultural production cooperatives developed greatly after correcting right-leaning conservative errors. More than 630,000 agricultural production cooperatives participated in the autumn harvest distribution this year, and by the end of the year, they had increased to more than 1.9 million, with more than 75 million households participating, accounting for approximately 63% of the total number of households in the country; the cultivated land area collectively managed has reached more than 1 billion mu, accounting for approximately 64% of the total cultivated land area in the country. Among these cooperatives, there are more than 17,000 agricultural production cooperatives in advanced forms, with more than 4.7 million participating households and a collectively managed cultivated land area of more than 82 million mu.

In 1955, China's agricultural production achieved a bumper harvest, with the total grain output reaching approximately 368 billion jin (184 million tons), completing 102% of the plan, an increase of 9% compared with 1954. The cotton output reached approximately 30.36 million dan (1.518 million tons), completing 117% of the plan, an increase of 43% compared with 1954. The percentages of the output of various major crops compared with 1954 are: rice 110, wheat 98, miscellaneous grains 111, soybeans 100, sugar cane 94, sugar beet 161, jute 195, flue-cured tobacco 128, rapeseed 110, and peanuts 106.

In 1955, tea production increased by 17% compared with 1954, silkworm cocoon production increased by 44% compared with 1954, and the output of major fruits such as apples, pears, citrus, bananas, and grapes increased by approximately 10% compared with 1954.

In 1955, in the main producing areas of various crops, the yield per unit area of agricultural production cooperatives significantly exceeded that of individual farmers: rice yielded 10% more; wheat yielded 7% more; soybeans yielded 19% more; and cotton yielded 26% more. This fully reflects the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives.

While the agricultural cooperativization movement developed, China's socialist state-owned agricultural enterprises achieved further development in 1955. The number of state-owned mechanized farms has increased to 106. These mechanized farms have a total cultivated land area of 4.04 million mu, an increase of 45% compared with 1954.

In 1955, the number of tractor stations has increased to 138, and the total workload of tractors throughout the year reached more than 4.9 million mu, an increase of 3 times compared with 1954.

In 1955, the horsepower of water pumps used for farmland water conservancy increased by 24% compared with 1954, and the benefited area reached more than 8.3 million mu. In 1955, the state built some large-scale water conservancy projects, and various places also newly built and renovated many small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, thereby expanding the irrigated area by more than 19 million mu and improving the irrigated area by more than 46 million mu.

In 1955, the reclaimed area reached approximately 13 million mu.

In 1955, livestock production did not complete the plan due to insufficient feed supply and improper handling of livestock entry into cooperatives. According to a survey at the end of June of the same year, the number of major livestock compared with the same period in 1954: cattle increased by 4%, horses increased by 5%, sheep increased by 4%, but the number of pigs decreased.

In 1955, mutual aid and cooperation organizations for fishery production developed rapidly, and the number of fishery cooperatives reached more than 7,600. In 1955, the total aquatic product output increased by 10% compared with 1954, of which the production of state-owned aquatic product enterprises increased by 14% compared with 1954.

In 1955, the total afforestation area in the country reached more than 25.6 million mu, an increase of 47% compared with 1954. Among them: the area of timber forests reached more than 14.2 million mu, and the area of protection forests reached 5.9 million mu; however, the survival rate of afforestation reached only 64%.

In 1955, the government spent more than 200 million yuan on rural relief and issued more than 1 billion yuan in agricultural loans.

In 1955, meteorological undertakings also developed, and the number of meteorological observatories and stations increased by 40% compared with 1954.

(3) Growth of Capital Construction

In 1955, the total amount of capital construction investment actually completed by the state was 8.63 billion yuan, completing 94% of the plan. The amount of investment actually completed (the amount of work calculated in currency), calculated on a comparable basis, increased by 9% compared with 1954; due to the reduction in capital construction quota unit prices, the amount of work actually completed (the amount of work calculated in physical objects, same below) increased by 15% compared with 1954, of which the amount of construction and installation work increased by 18% compared with 1954; the newly added fixed assets due to investment accounted for 86% of the total investment.

In 1955, in terms of industrial construction, the amount of work actually completed increased by 27% compared with 1954, and the total amount of investment actually completed accounted for 48% of the total national investment. In 1955, a total of 485 construction units above the limit were under construction, of which 82 had already been put into production in 1955, mainly such as Hegang Dongshan Vertical Shaft, Liaoyuan Central Vertical Shaft, Jixi Xiaohengshan Vertical Shaft, Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory, Dalian Thermal Power Plant, Ulabo Hydropower Station, Baotou Sugar Factory, Jiamusi Sugar Factory, Beijing No. 2 State-owned Cotton Factory, Shijiazhuang No. 2 State-owned Cotton Factory, Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Factory and Urumqi July 1st Cotton Textile Factory.

In 1955, in terms of transportation and postal and telecommunications construction, the amount of work actually completed increased by 27% compared with 1954. A total of 1,222 kilometers of new railways were laid. By the end of 1955, the track laying task of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang line had been completed by 24.8%, and the track laying task of the Baoji-Chengdu line had been completed by 73%. Major lines such as the Jining-Erlian line, the Litang-Zhanjiang line, the Fengtai-Shacheng line, and the Lancun-Yantai line have all been fully opened to traffic. A total of 8,138 kilometers of highways were built throughout the country, and the Chengdu-Aba line and the Xigaze-Gyangze line have been opened to traffic, thereby promoting the economic and cultural development of ethnic minority areas. The Pari-Yadong line running through the Himalayan Mountains is also nearing completion.

In 1955, in terms of agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy construction, the amount of work actually completed increased by 65% compared with 1954. In this year, the water conservancy department completed a total of more than 1.4 billion cubic meters of earthwork, more than 14 million cubic meters of stonework, and 600,000 cubic meters of concrete. The Nanwan Reservoir has been basically completed.

In 1955, in terms of public utilities construction, the amount of work actually completed increased by 9% compared with 1954. The state built a total of more than 14 million square meters of housing.

In 1955, the capital construction department launched a conservation campaign, lowered the design standards for non-productive construction. According to the statistics of 3,280 larger construction units in 1955, the funds saved reached more than 1 billion yuan, a reduction of 16.1% compared with the original investment plan. The task of reducing the cost of construction and installation projects stipulated by the state has also been basically completed.

In 1955, the total amount of geological exploration work in the country increased by 40% compared with 1954. The proven reserves of major minerals such as petroleum, iron, manganese, coal, tungsten, copper, lead, and phosphorus have all increased compared with 1954. In 1955, geological survey work has greatly developed, but it is far from catching up with the needs of exploration work.

(4) Development of Transportation and Postal and Telecommunications Undertakings and Socialist Transformation of Private Transportation Industry

In 1955, the total mileage of railways open to traffic in the country was 26,931 kilometers, the railway freight turnover increased by 5% compared with 1954, and the utilization rate of locomotives and vehicles has been improved.

In 1955, the percentages of the freight turnover of waterway wheel tugboats and automobiles in the country compared with 1954 were: inland rivers 132, coastal 104, and automobiles 135.

In 1955, the state also carried out socialist transformation of private transportation industry. In various transportation industries, except for railway and civil aviation transportation which are uniformly operated by the state, state-owned and joint state-private economy accounted for 98% of the waterway wheel tugboat freight turnover; in the automobile freight turnover, state-owned, joint state-private and cooperative economy accounted for 82%.

In 1955, the volume of postal and telecommunications business increased by 13% compared with 1954. The number of state-owned postal and telecommunications bureaus and offices increased by 34% compared with the end of 1954, and the number of postal and telecommunications agency offices decreased by 18% compared with the end of 1954.

(5) Expansion of Domestic and Foreign Trade and Socialist Transformation of Private Commerce

In 1955, the development of domestic trade in our country was slower due to the impact of the major floods in the previous year; in this year, the total retail sales of social commodities in the country increased by only 3% compared with 1954.

In 1955, the state-owned commercial commodity purchase plan was overfulfilled. The percentages of the main agricultural industrial raw materials purchased by state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce compared with 1954 were: cotton 151, flue-cured tobacco 136, jute for sacks 209, and vegetable oil 120.

In 1955, the state-owned commercial sales plan was not completed. The percentages of the domestic sales volume of major commodities of state-owned commerce compared with 1954 were: cotton cloth 108, sugar 123, edible vegetable oil 157, pork 134, cigarettes 96, coal 111, bicycles 139, paper 118, towels 116, and socks 115. The total value of means of production supplied to farmers by supply and marketing cooperatives increased by 23% compared with 1954.

In 1955, the national grain output increased compared with 1954, but the national procurement task in 1955 was reduced. Calculated on a calendar year basis, the total procurement volume for the whole year decreased by 10% compared with 1954. In this way, the amount of grain remaining in the hands of farmers after the harvest in 1955 increased. The total national grain sales volume in 1955 also decreased by 2% compared with 1954.

In 1955, the commodity sales volume of state-owned commerce in ethnic minority areas increased by 41% compared with 1954.

In 1955, the number of institutions of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce increased by 9% compared with 1954.

In 1955, the state actively carried out socialist transformation of private commerce. The proportion of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in the total wholesale volume of commodities in pure commercial institutions nationwide increased from 89% in 1954 to 95% in 1955; the proportion of state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce and state capitalist commerce in the total retail sales volume of commodities in pure commercial institutions nationwide increased from 74% in 1954 to 82% in 1955.

In 1955, national prices continued to remain stable. Compared with the same period in 1954, the national wholesale price index in December 1955 was 99.9%, and the retail price index in eight major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang was 100.7%.

In 1955, our country continued to expand economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and further developed trade with Asian and African countries and Western countries. The total value of import and export trade increased by approximately 30% compared with 1954.

(6) Number of Employees, Labor Productivity, and Employee Life

In 1955, various agencies and enterprises throughout the country adopted measures to streamline institutions and save labor. By the end of the year, the number of employees nationwide was more than 18.5 million, an increase of more than 200,000 compared with 1954.

In 1955, various industrial ministries trained a total of more than 96,000 skilled workers, and another 377,000 workers and cadres improved their technical proficiency through schools and training courses.

In 1955, the labor productivity of industrial production workers in state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private industries increased by 10% compared with 1954, of which: fuel mining industry increased by 8.2%, iron and steel smelting industry increased by 16.3%, non-ferrous metal industry increased by 15.7%, machine manufacturing industry increased by 12.9%, and chemical industry increased by 15.2%. The labor productivity of construction and installation workers in construction and installation enterprises increased by 17% compared with 1954.

In 1955, the average wage of employees (excluding private enterprises) nationwide increased by 3.9% compared with 1954. Due to the growth of average wages and the addition of a number of new employees, the total wage bill increased by 12% compared with 1954.

In 1955, many supply-system employees of state agencies were changed to wage-system, and the wages of lower-level staff in state agencies with lower wages and employees in commercial, cultural, and educational departments were also adjusted. Therefore, their wages have increased more. However, the wages of employees in the industrial and capital construction departments have increased little because of cancellation of some unreasonable bonuses and allowances, reasonable incentive systems were not established in a timely manner, and wage standards were not adjusted in a timely manner. In addition, the wages of workers in some departments were reduced because of idleness and work stoppages, so the wages of employees in these departments increased very little, and even the actual wages of some employees were reduced.

In 1955, the number of employees in enterprises nationwide implementing labor insurance increased by 6% compared with 1954, and the number of employees enjoying free medical care increased by approximately 5% compared with 1954.

    中华人民共和国国家统计局
    关于1955年度国民经济计划执行结果的公报
    1955年我国国民经济发生了深刻的变化。国民经济各部门，特别是轻工业生产和零售商业主要因受上年大水灾的影响，增长的速度比前几年慢一点。中共中央六中全会以后，由于批判和纠正了右倾保守思想，我国几万万农民响应中国共产党和毛主席的号召，掀起了农业的社会主义改造的高潮；全国手工业的合作化和资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营跟着进入高潮；国民经济也开始出现了新的高涨。现在将这一年来各主要部门的情况发表公报如下：
    （一）工业生产的增长、技术水平的
    提高和私营工业的社会主义改造
    1955年工业生产的基本情况是：重工业生产继续有显著的发展，轻工业生产因农产原料供应不足，增长速度较慢；同1954年比较，生产资料的生产增加了17％，消费品的生产只增加了1％。
    1955年全国工业（不包括合作化手工业和个体手工业，以下同）完成总产值计划101％，其中国营工业完成计划108％。各工业部完成总产值计划的百分比是：电力工业部102，煤炭工业部104，石油工业部109，重工业部106，第一机械工业部110，纺织工业部101，轻工业部106。
    1955年全国工业总产值比较1954年增加了8％，其中：国营工业增加了15％，合作社营工业增加了35％，公私合营工业增加了41％，私营工业下降了30％（主要由于又有一大批私营工业转变为公私合营）。
    1955年在列入五年计划的全国工业的45种主要工业产品中，有37种完成或超额完成了国家计划，其他8种没有完成计划。在这45种产品中，除两种新产品外，有31种产品的产量比较1954年有不同程度的增加，其他12种产品由于原料供应限制、产品不合需要和对需要估计不足等原因，比较1954年减产（金属切削机床台数虽减少，但吨数是增加的）。现在将特别重要的20种工业产品产量列表如下：
  产品名称　  单　位　1955年实际产量　同1954年比较（％）
  电　力　    百万度　    12，278　       112
