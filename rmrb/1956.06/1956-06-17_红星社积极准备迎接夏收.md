    Hongxing Cooperative Actively Prepares for Summer Harvest
    To the Editor:
    The Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lushan County, Henan Province, planted 22,771 mu of wheat this year. The processing of this wheat was better than in previous years. Each mu of wheat field was applied with three to four cartloads of topdressing fertilizer, and three thousand two hundred mu of wheat were also spring-irrigated. Later, measures such as frost and lodging prevention were strengthened. Therefore, the wheat is growing well now, and a good harvest is in sight. The co-op members are very happy, and everyone naturally expresses their joy when they talk about it.

    Now, each production team has formulated a seed selection plan, preparing to select and retain 187,731 jin of good varieties such as "Bima No. 1," "Baiyu Pi," "Hong Heshangtou," "Bai Heshangtou," and Kaifeng "124." In addition, 50,000 jin of "124" wheat seeds will be selected and handed over to the state for distribution to various regions. Now, each team has inserted signs in the selected fields, preparing to remove impurities and inferior varieties, harvest, thresh, and store them separately.

    The cooperative's wheat pre-distribution plan has also been formulated. Based on the yield assessment results, it is estimated that each mu can yield 210 jin, with a total income of more than 4.7 million jin of wheat. According to the pre-distribution calculation results, it is entirely possible to guarantee that more than 90% of the co-op members will increase their income. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of the co-op members has been greatly enhanced. Now everyone is actively preparing farm tools such as sickles, ropes, and carrying poles, preparing to go all out in the wheat harvest. Women are rushing to make shoes, socks, and clothes, preparing to go to the fields entirely during the wheat harvest.

    红星社积极准备迎接夏收编辑同志：
    河南鲁山县红星农业生产合作社今年种了22，771亩小麦。这些小麦的加工都比往年好，每亩麦田施了三、四车的追肥，其中有三千二百亩小麦还进行了春浇，后期又加强了防霜、防倒伏等措施。因此，现在小麦生长良好，丰收在望。社员们非常高兴，大家一谈起来就很自然地流露出喜悦的心情。
    现在，各个生产队已经订出选种计划，准备选留“碧玛一号”、“白玉皮”、“红和尚头”、“白和尚头”、开封“一二四”等良种187，731斤。此外还要选“一二四”麦种五万斤，交给国家供各地调剂之用。现在各队已经在选好的地里插上标，准备去杂去劣，单收、单打、单保存。
    全社小麦预分方案也已经订出来了。根据评产结果，估计每亩可收二百十斤，共可收入小麦四百七十多万斤。根据预分计算结果，完全可以保证90％以上的社员增加收入。因此，社员的生产积极性大大提高了。现在大家积极准备镰刀、绳子、扁担等农具，准备在麦收中大干一场。妇女们正在赶做鞋袜衣服，准备麦收中全部下地。
