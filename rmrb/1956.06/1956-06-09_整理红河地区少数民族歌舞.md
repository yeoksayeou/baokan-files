Xinhua News Agency dispatch: More than a hundred instrumental pieces and ditties popular among the Hani and Yi people on the south bank of the Honghe River in Yunnan Province, as well as many folk dances, legends, and poems, have been collected by the Yunnan Province Honghe Hani Autonomous Region Ethnic Song and Dance Troupe. Among the collected materials are the "Jiaobi Tunes" and "Sanxian Tunes" widely loved by the Hani people, the wine song tunes that have been popular for hundreds of years, and the ancient "Liubiha" dance.

　　In early April of this year, this ethnic dance troupe went to Honghe and Yuanyang counties in the autonomous region to perform and collect folk art materials from ethnic minorities. They were warmly welcomed and helped everywhere they went. Lu Ke're, a sixty-six-year-old Hani man and his six-year-old grandson, from Dazongqiao Village are well-known folk artists. The grandfather and grandson taught the song and dance team members the famous Hani fan dance. Now, the ethnic song and dance troupe has returned to Xinjie, the seat of the Autonomous Region People's Government, to begin creation and sorting work.
