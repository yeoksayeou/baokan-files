Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, London News: British Prime Minister Eden, at a Conservative Party rally in Warwick, England, emphasized that Britain must maintain its export markets and increase capital exports.

Eden said on June 23rd in his own constituency: "Tensions have eased, and everyone will feel relieved as a result. It seems that we are moving away from the Cold War towards a lukewarm peace." But, "We are watching a trade competition beginning to emerge, the likes of which we have not experienced before."

Eden called for strengthening Britain's economic competitive power. He said that as tensions eased, armaments could be reduced, thereby developing the economy. He said: "If we lose our export markets, it could cause harm to our country that German submarines twice failed to do."

He also emphasized that Britain must expand investment in the Commonwealth and other countries. In this regard, he said: "In fact, our investment in different regions of the Commonwealth has greatly increased, especially in Canada. In India, we have also recently decided to establish a large-scale steel factory." Eden also said that outside the Commonwealth, the Middle East "provides the best investment opportunities" for Britain.

Eden said: If one thinks that by selling the shares of the Trinidad Oil Company to an American company, we are "blindly unaware or indifferent to this (overseas investment) issue, then that is completely wrong."

    面临从未经历过的贸易竞争
    艾登说要加强英国经济竞争力量
    新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登在英格兰瓦尔威克的一次保守党集会上强调指出，英国必须保持出口市场和增加资本输出。
    艾登六月二十三日在他自己的选区里说：“紧张局势已经有了缓和，每一个人都会觉得因此松了一口气。看来我们是在离开冷战走向温热的和平。”但是，“我们眼看着一场我们以前没有经历过的贸易竞争正在开始出现。”
    艾登要求加强英国的经济竞争力量。他说，由于紧张局势和缓了下来，军备可以裁减了，从而也就要发展经济。他说：“要是我们丧失了出口市场，那就可能造成德国潜水艇两次都未能造成的对我国的危害。”
    他还强调英国必须扩大对英联邦和其他国家的投资。在这方面，他说：“事实上，我国对英联邦不同地区的投资已经大大增加了，特别是对加拿大的投资。在印度，我们最近也已经决定建立一个大规模的钢铁工厂。”艾登还说，在英联邦地区外，中东向英国“提供了最好的投资机会”。
    艾登说：如果以为出售特立尼达石油公司股票给美国公司，我们就是“盲然看不到或者漠然不顾这个（海外投资）问题，那就完全错了”。
