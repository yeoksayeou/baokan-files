Educating the Masses on the Importance of Soil and Water Conservation
--Speech by Delegate Zhao Shoushan

I fully agree with the reports and explanations of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, as well as the speeches of the responsible comrades from the Central Committee. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on soil and water conservation work in Shaanxi Province.

Shaanxi is one of the major provinces in the Yellow River Basin. The total land area of the province is 196,754 square kilometers, of which 121,772 square kilometers belong to the Yellow River Basin, accounting for approximately 62% of the province's total area. This area is located in the loess region of the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the situation of soil erosion every year is extremely serious. According to calculations, the annual soil loss within Shaanxi Province is estimated at 540 million tons, which accounts for approximately 40% of the 1.38 billion tons of sediment content of the Yellow River at Shanxian. This situation not only reduces the quality of the soil, causing frequent droughts in vast mountainous areas and preventing the improvement of crop yields; it also poses a constant threat of flooding from the Yellow River to the people in the lower reaches. Therefore, soil and water conservation work in Shaanxi Province is an important part of the Chinese people's fundamental solution to the Yellow River, as well as a fundamental measure to change the face of the mountainous areas and improve the lives of the people in those areas.

Since the adoption of the resolution on the comprehensive utilization plan of the Yellow River at the Second Session of the National People's Congress last year, our Shaanxi Province has attached greater importance to soil and water conservation work than before. Leading comrades at all levels of the Party and government have conducted in-depth publicity and mobilization work among the masses based on the great plan of fundamentally controlling the Yellow River. Leading comrades at all levels have also gone deep into the mountainous areas for inspection and guidance. The people of the whole province, especially the people in the mountainous areas, are very supportive of the decision to harness the Yellow River and carry out soil and water conservation, and their confidence has been greatly boosted. They believe that this is a fundamental way to change their backward production and improve yields, and thus quickly launched a mass movement for soil and water conservation. According to statistics, by the end of May this year, more than 3,388,600 mu of terraced fields and other field projects had been completed, and 77,900 mu of water-spreading land. In addition, more than 9,000 silt detention dams, 90,000 water storage ponds, and more than 14,000 gully dams have been built. These projects can control soil erosion over an area of more than 6,740 square kilometers, which is approximately equivalent to 58% of the total area of soil erosion control in the province from 1950 to 1955 in the past 6 years. At present, a mass movement of soil and water conservation work has been formed in most areas of northern Shaanxi. If this continues to develop, in a few years, not only can soil erosion be basically curbed and sediment in the Yellow River reduced, but also the natural conditions and economic outlook of our Shaanxi Province, especially the old revolutionary base areas in northern Shaanxi, will undergo major changes. By then, the beautiful scene of "orchards and grain fields, herds of mules and horses, and mountains full of cattle and sheep" that the people in the vast mountainous areas have dreamed of will truly appear before us.

Based on our experience in work, extensively and deeply publicizing the great significance of fundamentally controlling the Yellow River and the importance of soil and water conservation to the masses, organizing the masses, and visiting typical examples are important methods for carrying out the soil and water conservation movement. In the spring and summer of last year, the three special districts of Yulin, Suide, and Yan'an in northern Shaanxi suffered from droughts of varying degrees, and crop yields generally decreased, even to the point of no harvest. However, the areas where soil and water conservation work was carried out had increased yields compared to previous years. For example, in the Wujiapan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suide, land where no soil and water conservation work was carried out generally only yielded about 30 jin per mu, and some even yielded only 10 jin or 8 jin; however, land where soil and water conservation work was carried out generally yielded 100 jin per mu, and land where field projects were well done yielded as much as 280 jin to 312 jin per mu. These realistic examples have educated the masses through visits, making them truly realize the benefits of soil and water conservation and believe in scientific experiences such as "dams can increase production, and terraced fields can resist drought." Now, most of the people in the mountainous areas, especially the people in northern Shaanxi, have indeed realized the great significance of carrying out soil and water conservation and the actual benefits of improving production and improving life. The vast masses of the people have automatically risen up and plunged into this vigorous and great movement.

After the masses are mobilized, technical guidance is also an important issue. According to incomplete statistics from the three special districts of Suide, Yulin, and Yan'an, about 6,281 people have been trained, and 25,536 people have timely imparted experience to the masses. Larger agricultural cooperatives are equipped with technicians, who are initially able to master techniques such as measuring levels, measuring slopes, building terraced fields, and building silt detention dams. However, there are still few cadres trained, and the quality is not high enough, far from meeting the needs of the masses. Therefore, in some areas, the planning is inappropriate in the process of carrying out soil and water conservation work, and the field projects are not up to standard, such as uneven contour ridges, uneven horizontal ditches, and inappropriate locations of soil gully dams and water weirs. These are all issues that deserve our attention and correction in the future.

In short, soil and water conservation work is an important part of the Chinese people's efforts to control the Yellow River, and it is also a fundamental measure to curb soil erosion, increase crop yields in mountainous areas, and improve people's lives. In the past few years, although we have done some work and achieved certain results, it is still far from enough in terms of the tasks required by the Yellow River control plan, and there are still many shortcomings and difficulties. The people of our entire province are willing to continue to work hard and actively carry out this work, and with full confidence, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, we will work together with the people of the whole country to strive to realize this unprecedented great plan of fundamentally controlling the Yellow River!

### 教育群众认识水土保持的重要意义——赵寿山代表的发言

    教育群众认识水土保持的重要意义 
    ——赵寿山代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长的报告和说明，以及中央各负责同志的发言。现在我仅就陕西省的水土保持工作，讲一些意见。
    陕西是黄河流域的主要省分之一。全省土地总面积为196，754平方公里，其中属于黄河流域的即有121，772平方公里，约占全省总面积的62％。这个地区，位于黄河中游的黄土地带，每年水土流失的情况十分严重。据测算，陕西境内每年土壤的流失量计有54，000万吨，大约将占黄河在陕县含沙量138，000万吨的40％。这种情况，不只降低了土壤的质量，使广大山区十年九旱，农作物的产量不能提高；而且也使黄河下游地区的人民群众，经常受着黄河泛滥成灾的威胁。因此，陕西省的水土保持工作，是我国人民根治黄河的一个重要部分，同时也是改变山区面貌、改善山区人民生活的一项根本措施。
    自从去年全国人民代表大会第二次会议上通过了关于黄河综合利用规划的决议以后，我们陕西省对于水土保持工作，比较以前更加重视了。各级党政负责同志都根据根治黄河的伟大计划向广大群众进行了深入的宣传和发动群众的工作，各级领导同志还深入山区进行了检查和指导。全省人民，特别是山区的人民群众，对于治理黄河，进行水土保持的决定，是非常拥护的并且大大鼓舞了他们的信心。他们认为这是改变他们生产落后提高产量的根本办法，因而很快地便掀起了群众性的水土保持运动。根据统计，至今年五月底，修梯田及其他田间工程已经完成了3，388，600余亩，水漫地77，900余亩。此外并做了9，000多道淤地坝，挖了9万个涝池，修了14，000多道谷坊等。这些工程共可控制水土流失面积6，740多平方公里，大约相当于全省1950年至1955年6年来控制水土流失总面积的58％。目前陕北大部分地区已形成群众性的水土保持工作运动，就像这样发展下去，再有几年，不仅可以基本上制止水土流失，减少黄河的泥沙，而且我们陕西省尤其是陕北老区的自然条件和经济面貌也将有重大的变化。到那时候，广大山区人民所梦寐以求的“花果山，米粮川，骡马成群，牛羊满山”的富丽景象，也将真实地展现在我们的面前。
    根据我们在工作中的体会，广泛深入地向群众宣传根治黄河的伟大意义和水土保持的重要性，组织群众，典型参观，是开展水土保持运动的重要方法。去年春夏两季陕北榆林、绥德、延安三个专区，均程度不同的遭受了旱灾，农作物普遍减产，甚至颗粒不收。但是进行了水土保持工作的地区，产量较往年还有增加。如绥德吴家畔农业生产合作社，没有进行水土保持工作的土地，每亩一般只收30斤左右，有的甚至收10斤、8斤；但是进行了水土保持工作的土地，每亩一般也收100斤，田间工程做得好的土地，每亩产量竟达到280斤—312斤。这种现实的事例，通过参观，教育了广大群众，使他们切实认识到水土保持的好处，相信“坝地能增产，梯田能抗旱”等科学经验。现在山区人民，尤其是陕北人民中大多数确已认识到进行水土保持的伟大意义和实际能提高产量，改善生活的好处，广大人民群众已自动起来，投入了这一轰轰烈烈的伟大运动。
    群众发动起来以后，技术指导工作也是一个重要问题。据绥德、榆林、延安三个专区的不完全统计，受训的约有6，281人，及时把经验传授给群众的即达25，536人，较大的农业社都配备了技术员，他们初步能够掌握测水平，量坡度、修梯田、打淤地坝等技术。但是干部训练的还少，质量也还不高，远不能适应群众的要求，因而有些地区在进行水土保持工作中，规划不适当，田间工程不够标准，如等高埂不等，水平沟不平，土谷坊、水簸箕位置不适宜等，这都是值得我们今后注意纠正的。
    总之，水土保持工作，是我国人民治理黄河的重要部分，同时也是制止水土流失、提高山区农作物产量，改善人民生活的一项根本措施。几年来，我们虽然做了一些工作，取得了一定的成绩，但是就根治黄河规划所要求的任务来看，还是非常不够的，而且还有不少缺点和困难。我们全省人民愿意继续努力积极进行这一工作，并且信心百倍地在党中央和国务院的正确领导下，和全国人民一道为实现根治黄河这一亘古未有的伟大计划而奋斗！
