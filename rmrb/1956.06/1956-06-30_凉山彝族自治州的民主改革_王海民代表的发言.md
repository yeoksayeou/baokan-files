I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The 1956 national budget and the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives will powerfully guarantee the early completion of China's first Five-Year Plan and accelerate the realization of the overall socialist collectivization of agriculture. The increased state funding for minority nationality regions in the budget will enable these regions to develop and progress more rapidly.

Our Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province has seen significant development in various aspects due to the correct leadership and strong support of the Party and the government, as well as the active assistance of our Han brothers. The lives of the Yi people have improved. However, the existence of the slave system in the Liangshan Yi region seriously hinders the development of the Yi people's political, economic, and cultural undertakings. In recent years, under the radiant light of the Party and government's ethnic policies, the political awareness of the Yi people has rapidly increased. They urgently demand the swift implementation of democratic reforms to completely change the extremely brutal and backward slave system, enabling the Yi people to develop and progress rapidly, and to transition to socialism as soon as possible. The vast majority of the Yi upper class also actively support the implementation of democratic reforms. At the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture People's Representative Conference held in early February this year, based on the spirit of the Constitution and the government's policies on democratic reform, and in accordance with the demands of the broad masses and the wishes of relevant representatives, after full consultation and discussion, a unanimous resolution was passed to complete democratic reforms in the entire prefecture (except for the Yi-Han mixed residential areas that have already completed land reform) in batches and phases within this year. Implementation measures for democratic reform were formulated. Subsequently, each county formed democratic reform executive organs, mainly composed of Yi cadres. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, democratic reform work was launched successively in the entire region in February. By the end of April, democratic reform work had been completed or basically completed in areas with a population of 530,000. The remaining areas with a population of 240,000 will all complete democratic reform work within this year.

In implementing democratic reform, in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, full consideration was given to the characteristics of the Yi people and the Yi region. A more moderate approach was adopted. All relevant issues in the democratic reform were repeatedly and fully consulted with representatives from all strata, and decisions were implemented only after unanimous agreement was reached. In the democratic reform, a lenient policy was adopted towards slave owners. In addition to abolishing the slave system and liberating slaves from the brutal rule and exploitation of slave owners, the slave owners' land, surplus livestock, farm implements, houses, and grain were handled separately through confiscation, requisition, and purchase. In addition, the slave owners' other property was retained, and it was decided not to settle historical crimes, return deposits, settle exploitation accounts, dig up hidden wealth, or conduct anti-hegemony struggles. Instead, peaceful negotiations were used. All slave owners who were willing to accept democratic reform were warmly welcomed and encouraged. Slave owners who resisted democratic reform were repeatedly persuaded and educated in every possible way to raise their awareness, eliminate their concerns, and enable them to voluntarily accept democratic reform. During the democratic reform movement, while resolutely relying on the slave masses and consolidating the solidarity of all laborers, attention was paid to uniting all other people who supported democratic reform. A policy of unity and education was resolutely implemented towards the middle and upper strata of the Yi people, and more than 2,000 people from the middle and upper strata were absorbed to participate in the work of governments and political consultative organs at all levels. Those from the middle and upper strata who did not participate in government work were also given appropriate living allowances to enable them to obtain new political status and maintain their original standard of living, and some even improved. Due to the adoption of the above appropriate and correct measures, the democratic reform work was able to proceed smoothly, achieving a great victory. It achieved the abolition of the slave system, the liberation of slaves, and the distribution of slave owners' land, thereby liberating rural productive forces.

However, we are not without shortcomings and mistakes in our democratic reform work. In fact, there are quite a few shortcomings and mistakes. For example, because we did not do enough in preparing for democratic reform and educating cadres on policy and ideology, especially the existence of Han chauvinism among some individual Han cadres, errors of simple, crude, or paternalistic work styles occurred, such as not trusting the masses, not relying on the masses, and not conducting policy and ideological education well for the masses. Even individual cases of violating ethnic unity and democratic reform policies occurred. These shortcomings and mistakes were quickly corrected and overcome under the timely guidance of the Party and higher-level governments, ensuring the smooth progress of the democratic reform work. However, there are still many remaining problems that need to be addressed.

At the same time, it must also be pointed out that before the democratic reform was launched, individual reactionary slave owners, incited by lurking Kuomintang remnant bandits and special agents, had launched slave owner rebellions in some areas with weak work. The purpose of these slave owner rebellions was to attempt to obstruct the implementation of democratic reform and prevent their slaves from being liberated. However, the slave owners' attempt to obstruct the implementation of democratic reform failed. They were fooled by the Kuomintang remnant bandits and special agents, and took the wrong path in history, because their rebellion violated the advance of social history and isolated themselves from all the people who demanded liberation. Therefore, when they rebelled, it aroused the righteous indignation of all the working people, causing all the slaves to take up arms and fight them to the death. Therefore, the slave owners' rebellion was quickly eliminated by the people who had awakened and taken up arms. The government adopted a lenient policy towards all those who participated in the rebellion. For example, slave owner elements who participated in the rebellion, as long as they could repent, did not listen to the Kuomintang remnant bandits and special agents' rumors and provocations, and stopped the rebellion, regardless of whether they were principal offenders or accomplices, would be treated leniently and not held accountable for past misdeeds. Only those who, after education and efforts to win them over, still stubbornly resisted, would be given the necessary blows.

In the areas where democratic reform has been completed, the slave system has been abolished, the slave masses have been liberated, and more than 70% of the masses have been distributed land and some other means of production. The productive enthusiasm of the broad masses has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and they actively demand to take the road of collectivization. In a very short period of time, 333 elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established throughout the autonomous prefecture, and 9 advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established on a trial basis. The number of peasant households joining mutual aid teams has accounted for more than 40% of the total number of peasant households. The broad masses actively respond to the Party and government's call for increased production, and all agricultural cooperatives have formulated plans to increase production by 20% to 50%. The labor rate of the masses has generally increased by about 50%. Spring plowing this year was completed 10 to 15 days ahead of schedule. The amount of fertilizer applied by some agricultural cooperatives has more than doubled compared to last year. This is an unprecedented phenomenon. The farming techniques of the masses have also been significantly improved. They actively learn advanced production experience and learn to use new farm tools. The old habits of "planting many and harvesting little" and "slash-and-burn cultivation" will gradually be replaced by "deep plowing and meticulous cultivation" and advanced production techniques. In the areas where democratic reform has been completed, the political awareness of the broad masses has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Their unparalleled love for the motherland and their heartfelt support for the Party and the government are completely understandable. Driven by this situation, basic-level political power has been universally established, a large number of Yi cadres have grown up, and the broad masses of the Yi people are truly masters of their own affairs. Ethnic unity has also been further consolidated. All of these have created conditions for our Yi people to develop their own political, economic, and cultural undertakings well, and to gradually transition to socialism. Judging from the changes in our Liangshan Yi region in recent years, especially from the development of democratic reform and agricultural mutual aid and cooperation this spring, and from the rapid awakening and enthusiasm of the broad masses, our Yi people, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, will be able to realize semi-socialist agricultural collectivization in about three years after the completion of democratic reform, and will be able to realize fully socialist agricultural collectivization in about five years. In about seven to ten years, we will strive to reach a level close to that of advanced nationalities in terms of politics, economy, and culture. In the big family of the motherland, under the wise leadership of the Party and the government, and with the support of fraternal nationalities, our Yi people will be able to complete the historical tasks of democratic reform and socialist transformation in such a short period of time, and leap from the most backward slave system to the advanced socialist society. How can this not make us happy!

At the same time, we must also see that our Yi region is still very backward in all aspects. Our road ahead is still very arduous. Completing or about to complete democratic reform only creates conditions for continuing to move forward. To transition to a beautiful socialist society, we must make even greater efforts. At the same time, we also need the government to continue to provide more and better assistance in terms of human, material, and technical resources.

    凉山彝族自治州的民主改革
    ——王海民代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告、廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明和彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。1956年国家预算和高级农业生产合作社示范章程，将有力的保证我国第一个五年计划提前完成和加速农业全社会主义合作化的实现。在预算中增加了国家在少数民族地区的经费，这将使少数民族地区得以更迅速的发展与进步。
    我们四川省凉山彝族自治州，几年来由于党和政府的正确领导和大力扶持，以及汉族老大哥的积极帮助，各方面都获得显著的发展，彝族人民的生活得到提高。但由于凉山彝族地区还存在着奴隶制度，严重地阻碍了彝族的政治、经济和文化事业的发展。几年来，在党和政府的民族政策光辉照耀下，彝族人民的政治觉悟有了迅速提高，迫切要求很快实行民主改革，彻底改变极端残暴与落后的奴隶制度，使彝族人民得以迅速发展与进步，及早过渡到社会主义。绝大多数彝族上层人士也积极赞助实行民主改革。在今年二月上旬召开的凉山彝族自治州人民代表会议上，一方面本着宪法和政府有关民主改革的政策精神；一方面根据广大群众的要求和各有关代表人物的志愿，经过充分协商讨论后，一致通过了在今年内分批分期完成全州（除已完成土地改革的彝汉族聚居区外）民主改革的决议，制订了民主改革的实施办法。接着各县组成以彝族干部为主的民主改革执行机关。在党和政府的领导下，全区民主改革工作于二月份先后展开起来。至四月底，已在53万人口的地区内完成或基本上完成了民主改革工作。其余24万人口的地区将在今年内全部完成民主改革工作。
    在实施民主改革中，根据宪法精神，充分照顾了彝族与彝族地区的特点，采取了更为和缓的方针，对民主改革中的一切有关问题，我们都同各阶层的代表人物经过了反复充分的协商，取得了一致的意见后才决定实行。在民主改革中对奴隶主采取了宽大政策，除废除奴隶制度，将奴隶从奴隶主的残暴统治剥削下解放出来外，对于奴隶主的土地，及其多余的耕畜、农具、房屋及粮食，采取分别没收、征收和征购等办法，加以分别处理，此外对于奴隶主的其他财产，均予以保留，并决定对奴隶主的历史罪恶，不予清算和不退押金、不算剥削帐、不挖底财，也不进行反霸斗争，而是采用和平谈判的方式来进行，对所有愿意接受民主改革的奴隶主，都一律给予热烈的欢迎和鼓励。对民主改革有抵触的奴隶主，则采用一切可能办法，进行反复的说服教育，以提高其认识，消除其顾虑，使其能自动的接受民主改革。民主改革运动中，在坚决贯彻依靠奴隶群众和巩固的团结全体劳动者的同时，注意了团结其他一切赞助民主改革的人士。对彝族中的中、上层人物，坚决贯彻了团结教育的政策，并吸收了2，000余名中、上层人士参加各级政府和政治协商机关工作，对未参加政府工作的中、上层人士亦酌情予以生活补助，使他们能获得新的政治地位和能保持原有生活水平，有的并且得到了提高。由于采用了以上适当的正确措施，使民主改革工作得以顺利进行，取得了巨大的胜利，达到了废除奴隶制度，解放了奴隶，分配了奴隶主土地，使农村生产力获得了解放。
    但我们在民主改革工作中并不是没有缺点和错误的，而且缺点和错误也是不少的。例如：由于我们对民主改革的准备工作和干部的政策思想教育还作得不够，特别是在某些个别汉族干部中还存在大汉族主义思想，因此也就曾发生过不相信群众、不依靠群众，对群众也不很好进行政策思想教育等简单粗糙或包办代替的错误作风。甚至于个别曾发生过违反民族团结和民主改革政策的现象。这些缺点和错误，在党和上级政府的及时指导下，虽很迅速的被纠正与克服，保证了民主改革工作的顺利进行，但遗留下来而须得继续处理的问题仍是不少的。
    同时还必须指出的，即在民主改革还未展开之前，个别反动的奴隶主，在潜伏的国民党残余匪特的煽动下，曾在部分工作薄弱的地区，发生过奴隶主的叛乱，这些奴隶主叛变的目的，是在企图阻挠民主改革的实施，不让他的奴隶获得解放。但这些奴隶主企图阻挠民主改革实施的目的是失败了，他是上了国民党残余匪特挑拨离间的当，走错了历史应走的道路，因为他们这种叛变，是违反了社会历史前进车轮的，是脱离了一切要求解放的人民而陷自己于孤立的错误作法的。因此当着他们叛变起来后，即激起了全体劳动人民的义愤，使得所有奴隶都拿起武器来同他们作决死的斗争。因此使得奴隶主的叛变，很快即被已经觉悟和已经拿起武器的人民消灭了。政府对于一切参加叛乱的分子都一律采取宽大处理政策，如对于参加叛乱的奴隶主分子，只要他们能够悔悟，不听信国民党残余匪特的造谣挑拨，停止叛乱，不论其是首恶，还是胁从，一律从宽处理，不究既往，只对那些经过教育争取无效而仍坚决顽抗的分子，才予以必要的打击。
    在已经完成了民主改革的地区，奴隶制度已被废除，奴隶群众获得了解放，70％以上的群众分得了土地及部分其他生产资料，广大群众的生产积极性空前提高，积极要求走合作化的道路，在很短的时间内，全自治州已建立了333个初级农业生产合作社，并试建了9个高级农业生产合作社，加入互助组的农户已占总农户的40％以上，广大群众积极响应党和政府的增产号召，各农业社都纷纷订出增产20％到50％的增产计划。群众的劳动率普遍提高50％左右；今年春耕生产提前10天至15天完成，有的农业社施肥量比去年增加了一倍以上，这是从未有过的现象。群众的耕作技术亦有显著的改进，积极学习先进生产经验和学习使用新式农具，旧有的“多种薄收”和“刀耕火种”的习惯将逐步为“深耕细作”和先进生产技术所代替，在已完成民主改革的地区，广大群众的政治觉悟空前提高，他们对祖国无比的热爱和对党与政府的衷心拥护，这是完全可以理解的。在这样的情况推动下，因而普遍的建立了基层政权，成长了大批彝族干部，广大的彝族人民是真正当家作主了；民族团结亦得到进一步的巩固。所有这些，为我们彝族人民很好的发展自己的政治、经济和文化事业，逐步过渡到社会主义创造了条件。我们凉山彝族地区从几年来的变化，特别从今春民主改革和农业互助合作的发展，以及从广大群众的觉悟迅速及其积极性来看，我们彝族人民在党和政府的领导与扶持下，在民主改革完成后，大约在三年内是能够实现半社会主义的农业合作化，在大约五年内是能够实现完全社会主义的农业合作化，在大约七至十年内争取能在政治、经济和文化等方面达到接近于先进民族的水平。我们彝族人民在祖国的大家庭里，在党和政府的英明领导下，在兄弟民族的支援下，将能在这样短的时期内完成民主改革和社会主义改造的历史任务，从最落后的奴隶制度跃进到先进的社会主义社会，这怎能不使我们高兴呢！
    我们同时还必须看到：我们彝族地区在各方面都还是很落后的，我们前进的路程仍是很艰巨的，完成或即将完成民主改革，仅仅是为继续前进创造条件，要过渡到美好的社会主义社会，还必须作更大的努力，同时还需要政府在人力、物力和技术等方面继续予以更多更好的帮助。
