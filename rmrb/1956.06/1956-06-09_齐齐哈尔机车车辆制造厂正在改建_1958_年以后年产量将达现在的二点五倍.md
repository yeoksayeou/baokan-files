    Annual Output Will Reach 2.5 Times the Current Amount After 1958
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant is undergoing comprehensive reconstruction. Construction of the plant's office building, employee dormitories, and other projects has already begun. The design for the plant's reconstruction project largely adopts Soviet and domestic standard design drawings. The entire reconstruction project includes more than sixty construction projects, including factory buildings, warehouses, power systems, transportation systems, and dormitories. Among them, the production scale of the steel casting workshop after reconstruction will be ten times larger than the current scale, and the entire production process will be mechanized and semi-automated. The production scale of the freight car workshop after reconstruction will also be more than five times larger than the current scale.
    The reconstruction project of this factory will be completed and handed over for production in 1958. At that time, it will become a new type of factory capable of producing various freight cars, and its annual output will be 2.5 times the current output.
