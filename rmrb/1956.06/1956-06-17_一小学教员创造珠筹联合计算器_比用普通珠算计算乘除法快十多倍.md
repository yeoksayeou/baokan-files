A primary school teacher creates a bead-chip combined calculator.
More than ten times faster than using an ordinary abacus for multiplication and division.

    (Our Newspaper) News: Mo Huabin, a teacher at Xianchaqiao Primary School in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, has successfully created a bead-chip combined calculator. Using this calculator for multiplication and division is more than ten times more efficient than using an ordinary abacus. People who can generally perform addition and subtraction on an abacus can learn to perform multiplication and division of numbers up to six digits within one or two hours. After evaluation by relevant departments in Shaodong County, it is believed that it can be promoted.
    After a year of research and experimentation, Mo Huabin absorbed the essence of ancient Chinese bamboo chip arithmetic on the original basis of the abacus and created a "bead-chip multiplication and division assistant." Installing it on the abacus creates the bead-chip combined calculator. The assistant has a total of thirty small rectangular wooden sticks (chips), and each stick has a different number on its four sides and the products of this number from one to nine times. This assistant is responsible for the organization of horizontal products in abacus multiplication and division calculations. Any product of a multi-digit number multiplied by a single digit, or a single digit quotient of any multi-digit division, can be seen through simple arrangement. The vertical numerical organization is carried out using abacus addition and subtraction. In this way, the complicated multiplication and division process can be transformed into a simple addition and subtraction process. During the summer harvest pre-distribution this year, the Yuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Xianchaqiao District used this calculator to calculate 430 multiplications of four-digit numbers multiplied by four- to five-digit numbers, and it only took three people two hours and thirty minutes.

    一小学教员创造珠筹联合计算器 
    比用普通珠算计算乘除法快十多倍
    本报讯　湖南省邵东县仙槎桥小学教员莫华斌创造成功了一种珠筹联合计算器。使用这种计算器计算乘除法，比使用普通算盘能提高工作效率十多倍。一般能打珠算加减法的人，学一、二小时，便会作六位数以内的乘除算法。经过邵东县有关部门鉴定，认为可以推广。
    莫华斌经过一年的研究试验，在珠算原有基础上，吸取我国古代竹筹算术的精华，创造了一种“珠算乘除助算器”，将它装在算盘上，就成为珠筹联合计算器。助算器上共有三十根长方形的小木棍（筹），每根木棍的四面都有一个不同的数码和这个数码的一至九倍的积数。这个助算器担任了珠算乘除计算中的横面乘积的组织工作，只要通过简单的拼排，就能看出任何多位数乘以一位数的乘积，或者任何多位数除法的一位商数。纵面的数字组织工作，则利用珠算加减法进行。这样，就可以完全废除乘除口诀，把繁杂的乘除过程化为简单的加减过程。仙槎桥区禹兴农业社，今年夏收预分中，用这种计算器计算四位数乘四到五位数的乘法四百三十笔，三个人只用去了二小时三十分。
