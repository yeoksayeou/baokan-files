    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 12th: According to a dispatch from a correspondent of the Korean Central News Agency in Berlin, Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said on June 9th in Berlin, in response to a question from Nemenar Rai, a reporter for the Indian "Near and Far East News": The Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the statement by the United Nations Command that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should withdraw from South Korea is a serious violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and an act of expanding armaments and intensifying tensions in South Korea.
    The Korean Premier, who is currently visiting the German Democratic Republic, told the Indian reporter regarding the peaceful reunification of Korea that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is working, and will continue to work, to achieve the reunification of Korea peacefully on a democratic basis by the Koreans themselves. We have repeatedly suggested to the South Korean authorities that contact be established and negotiations be held between the North and the South. We advocate the establishment of a standing committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea to discuss the issue of contact between the North and the South and the peaceful reunification of Korea.
    He also said that in order to make the Korean armistice a lasting peace, we recently decided to reduce our army by 80,000 men. We are prepared to continue to take active measures to ease tensions and establish an atmosphere of mutual trust.
    Kim Il-sung said that we continue to advocate that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea, and that an international conference of relevant countries with representatives from North and South Korea should be convened to peacefully resolve the Korean question.
    Referring to the relations between Korea and Asian and Arab countries, Kim Il-sung said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea approves of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is striving to establish and develop cooperative relations with all countries on the basis of these principles.
    In particular, we are working to strengthen cultural and economic relations with Asian and Arab countries that are struggling against colonialism for their national independence. We approve of multifaceted contacts with these countries, and we agree to exchange parliamentary delegations, cultural delegations, and economic delegations, and to exchange individual scientists and socio-political activists.

    特别是，我们正在努力加强同正在为自己国家的民族独立而同殖民主义进行斗争的亚洲国家和阿拉伯国家的文化关系和经济关系。我们赞成同这些国家进行多方面的接触，我们同意互派议会代表团，互派文化代表团和经济代表团，互派个别科学家和社会政治活动家。
