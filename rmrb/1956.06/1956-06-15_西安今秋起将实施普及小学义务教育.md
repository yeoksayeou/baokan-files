Xi'an to Implement Universal Compulsory Elementary Education Starting This Autumn

(Our report) Starting this autumn, Xi'an will implement universal compulsory elementary education, ensuring that all healthy school-age children in the city receive the necessary basic education.

As early as February this year, relevant units in Xi'an conducted a survey of the number of school-age children. Combining the existing distribution of schools, the number and residential situation of residents, the development of agricultural cooperatives, and changes occurring in urban construction, they divided school districts, established a school network, and determined to leverage the potential of existing primary schools to vigorously run the two-shift system (二部制).

In order to create conditions for universal compulsory elementary education and improve teaching quality, efforts will be made to vigorously cultivate and reserve teachers. In the first half of this year, Xi'an Normal School has added a short-term crash course for lower grade elementary school teachers, absorbing more than 50 students to participate in learning. Some teachers were also transferred to the Xi'an Teachers' Continuing Education School for rotational training, and at the same time, correspondence courses and other methods are being used to help existing teachers pursue further studies in their spare time.

    西安今秋起将实施普及小学义务教育
    本报讯　从今年秋季起，西安全市将实施普及小学义务教育，使全市所有身体健康的学龄儿童，都要受到必要的基础教育。
    早在今年二月，西安市有关单位就对学龄儿童的人数进行了调查，结合现有学校分布，居民人数及居住情况、农业合作社的发展及城市建设所发生的变化等，划分了学区，建立了学校网，并确定发挥现有小学的潜在力量，大力开办二部制。
    为了给普及小学义务教育创造条件和提高教学质量，并将大力培养和储备师资。今年上半年已经在西安市师范学校增设了小学低年级教师短期速成班，吸收五十多名学员参加学习，并且抽调了一些教师到西安市教师进修学校轮训，同时用函授等方式，帮助现有教师在业余进修。
