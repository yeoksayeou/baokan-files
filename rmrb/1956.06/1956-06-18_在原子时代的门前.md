    On the Threshold of the Atomic Age
    Yu. Anningkeffu, Soviet Union
    More than half a million years ago, people discovered fire. Needless to say, when the first fire illuminated the vault of the primitive cave, our ancient ancestors could not even imagine what the power of flame would bring to mankind. They did not know that the spark in the darkness of the prehistoric forest marked the beginning of civilization. Thousands of years passed, and then people began to become the supreme rulers of their planet. Metallurgy, steam engines, and electricity changed the face of the earth. However, all the physical and chemical processes that technology could utilize only touched the electron shell of the atom. The mysterious atomic nucleus remained elusive. Now we are witnessing the greatest new achievement. The infinite power hidden in the atomic nucleus has begun to serve mankind. We are different from primitive people: they did not understand the properties of the fire they discovered, but we can now roughly describe the prospects of using atomic energy.
    Comrade N. A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said: "We are standing on the threshold of a new scientific, technological, and industrial revolution, the significance of which far exceeds the industrial revolution caused by the emergence of steam and electricity."
    In the 1930s of this century, physicists completed experiments on atomic nuclear fission in their laboratories. The discovery of the chain reaction of atomic nuclei made it possible to propose the practical application of atomic energy. Unfortunately for all mankind, this greatest discovery was manifested as the greatest crime. Even now, the surviving residents of Hiroshima and their children, born in the years after the unforgettable night of August 6, 1945, are still suffering from the tragic consequences of the atomic bombing.
    The road to the future truly began with the commissioning of the Soviet Union's world's first industrial atomic energy power plant in the summer of 1954. This is the starting point of an era that will bring people an unprecedented victory over the forces of nature.
    By 1960, the Soviet state will produce 320 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. In about 25 years, the electricity required by the Soviet Union's booming national economy will be no less than 12 trillion to 15 trillion kilowatt-hours per year. Only by using atomic fuel can the national economy be supplied with enough energy. It should be known that one kilogram of uranium can generate the same amount of electricity as a train of coal burned by an ordinary power station.
    Academician Kurchatov said at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the Soviet state is now vigorously conducting theoretical research, designing and building new scientific and industrial equipment for studying atomic energy and atomic structure. The world's largest basic particle accelerator, the synchrophasotron, which can enable protons to obtain 10 billion electron volts of energy, will soon be put into production. In the next few years, atomic energy power stations with a total power generation capacity of 2 million to 2.5 million kilowatts will be generating electricity in the Urals and near Moscow.
    Currently, the only way to convert atomic energy into electrical energy is through atomic boilers, which scientists call nuclear reactors. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates the establishment of dozens of different types of reactors.
    A new and undoubtedly significant problem that will be solved has been put on the agenda. This is the utilization of light element synthesis, such as the energy released when hydrogen is converted into helium. For tens of millions of years, this thermonuclear reaction has been constantly taking place inside the sun and stars. It has been possible to artificially reproduce this reaction in hydrogen bombs. The task is to learn to regulate and control this violent reaction process. If this is achieved, mankind will never have to worry about the source of energy. It should be known that hydrogen is widely distributed in nature, and its reserves are virtually inexhaustible.
    Many of the things that humans have only imagined in myths for the past few centuries have now been realized. Even the wildest fantasies cannot keep up with the rapidly changing modern science. Medieval alchemists wasted their efforts trying to turn one substance into another. After some time, people abandoned this ideal because they thought it was fundamentally impossible to achieve. But in this century, the discovery of nuclear reactions has made it possible to turn nitrogen into carbon, carbon into oxygen, aluminum into phosphorus, and gold into mercury. It is also possible to turn mercury into gold. But now there are even more fascinating prospects before science.
    Any element can now be made into a radioactive element. The chemical properties of radioactive isotopes are exactly the same as those of the element. The only differences are in atomic weight and radioactive radiation capability. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the amount of radioactive isotopes in Soviet atomic boilers will reach the equivalent of 10,000 tons of radium. With abundant radioactive isotopes, they can be used extensively in all aspects of the national economy. The utilization of these substances is based on the use of various automatic devices and control instruments. These strange elements that did not exist in nature before make it possible to study the interaction of metals in alloys, the wear of friction parts on machines, and the biological processes that occur in the organisms of plants and animals. Scientists add a small amount of radioactive isotopes of phosphorus or carbon to ordinary phosphorus or carbon and observe how these elements behave in the leaves of plants and in the blood of animals or humans. This is the so-called "tracer atom method" that is carrying out a real revolution in biology.
    Seeds irradiated with radioactive isotopes can increase yields significantly. To prevent potatoes from sprouting within a year, just irradiate them with radioactive cobalt. An ampoule of this radioactive cobalt in another instrument can observe the process of iron smelting and will eliminate expensive and bulky X-ray equipment from technology and medicine.
    Doctors have obtained a powerful weapon to fight diseases that some drugs are powerless against. A dose of oral radioactive phosphorus can stop polycythemia vera, a serious blood disease. Mankind's long-term disaster—malignant tumors—is gradually receding under the attack of advanced science that has mastered the effective and rapid power of atomic radiation. Radium therapy has saved thousands of patients who were doomed to die from terrible diseases. Not long ago, radium treatment could only be done in a few of the largest academies. Now, many hospitals in cities throughout the Soviet Union are successfully using radioactive isotopes. The deep irradiation device created by the Soviet Union can treat tumors that grow deep in the human body, such as lung cancer or osteosarcoma.
    This brief and extremely inadequate account shows how quickly liberated atomic energy is paving the way for itself in current science and technology. It can be predicted with certainty that in the future all kinds of fuels will be replaced by atomic fuels. It should be known that the reserves of uranium and thorium contain ten to twenty times more energy than the total reserves of coal and oil.
    In a few more years, even in the most remote areas of the Soviet state, there will be powerful power centers transmitting electricity to enterprises and fields. The abundant useful mineral resources sleeping in the deserted jungles and under the polar ice will be enjoyed by mankind. Atomic centers will send out torrents of energy day and night that can melt the polar ice and turn deserts into gardens. These centers will have no difficulty obtaining fuel. The atomic icebreakers currently being built will be the forerunners of mobile power centers, providing energy—heat and light—to the coast of the Arctic Ocean and the lower reaches of the great Siberian rivers. Submarines equipped with atomic engines will travel under the ice of the polar seas, and atomic locomotives will run on the ground. This 7,000-horsepower locomotive can travel 30,000 kilometers with just one fueling. In the future, atomic engines will also be used in cars. It is conceivable that there will be an electric car that is powered by a battery that obtains electrical waves from isotope decay. However, aircraft equipped with atomic reactors and equipped with jet turbine engines will show the most fascinating prospects. Such aircraft fly above the stratosphere at speeds of 10,000 to 20,000 kilometers per hour, crossing oceans and continents in just an hour or two. Non-stop flights from Beijing to Moscow or from Warsaw to Vladivostok will become the simplest and most common thing. New worlds existing outside our planet will be opened up to mankind. Atomic reactors can create the jet speed that allows interstellar rockets to break free from the earth's gravity. Mankind's boldest fantasies will be realized: spaceships break the shackles of gravity, bringing the inhabitants of Earth to the moon, and then to other planets in the solar system. And here, on Earth, the power of atomic explosions will make roads through the mountains, build artificial reservoirs, dig up deeply buried useful mineral resources, and build dams by blasting millions of cubic meters of rock to predetermined locations. People can even change the climate. People will change ocean currents and air currents. For example, a dam can be built across the Bering Strait to isolate the northern Pacific Ocean from the Arctic ice in order to change the climate of Kamchatka and Alaska.
    The tasks facing modern science are extremely great and noble. The successful completion of these tasks is inseparable from the struggle to ban the use and testing of all types of atomic and thermonuclear weapons.
    Loyal to its policy of peaceful cooperation, the Soviet Union is happy to share its achievements in atomic dynamics with other countries. The recently signed agreement on the establishment of the Joint Nuclear Research Institute has opened a new page in the development of atomic physics. The Soviet people, together with the great Chinese people and the people of other people's democratic countries, are working closely together to solve the major problems of atomic dynamics for the benefit of peace and progress, and for the happiness of all mankind.

    在原子时代的门前
    苏联　尤·安宁科夫
    人们在五十多万年以前发现了火。不消说，当火堆最初照亮了原始山洞的穹窿的时候，我们远古的祖先甚至还远远不能想像火焰的力量会给人类带来什么。他们不知道史前森林的黑暗中的火花就标志着文明的开端。几千年过去了，于是人们开始成为自己行星的无上权威的统治者。冶金术、蒸汽机、电，改变了地球的面貌。然而，技术能够利用的一切物理化学过程，仅仅触到了原子的电子外壳。神秘的原子核仍然是难以捉摸的。现在我们亲眼看到了最伟大的新成就。蕴藏在原子核中的无穷力量开始为人类服务。我们和原始人不同：他们不明白自己发现的火的属性，而我们现在已经能够大体上描述利用原子能的前景了。
    苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁同志说：“我们站在新的科学技术和工业革命的门槛上，这次革命的意义远远超过了由于蒸汽和电的出现而发生的工业革命。”
    本世纪的三十年代，物理学家在自己的实验室中完成了原子核分裂的试验。原子核链式反应的发现使人们有可能提出实际运用原子能的问题。对全人类说来，不幸的是，这个最伟大的发现曾被表现为最大的罪行。直到现在，幸存的广岛居民和他们的那些在1945年8月6日的难忘的夜晚以后几年出生的儿女们，还在受着原子爆炸的惨痛后果的折磨。
    由于苏联的世界第一个工业原子能电力站在1954年夏天投入了生产，通向未来的道路才真正开始了。这里是将给人们带来对自然力的空前胜利的时代的起点。
    到1960年，苏维埃国家将生产三千二百亿度电力，大约经过二十五年，苏联的蓬勃发展的国民经济所需的电力每年将不下于十二万亿度到十五万亿度。只有利用原子燃料才能供给国民经济以足够的能量。要知道，一公斤铀就能发出相当于普通电力站燃用一列车煤所生产的电力。
    库尔恰托夫院士在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上说，苏维埃国家现在正在大力进行理论研究，设计并建立研究原子能和原子构造的新的科学和工业设备。能使质子获得一百亿电子伏特能量的世界上最大的基本粒子加速器——同步稳相加速器不久就将投入生产。在最近几年，在乌拉尔和莫斯科附近的总发电能力为二百万到二百五十万瓩的原子能电力站就要发电了。
    目前变原子能为电能的唯一途径是原子锅炉，即科学家所说的核子反应堆。第六个五年计划规定建立数十种不同类型的反应堆。
    一个新的、无疑地将会得到解决的最重大的问题已经提到日程上来。这就是利用轻元素合成，例如由氢变氦时所释放出来的能。几十万万年以来，太阳和星球内部就经常进行着这种热核子反应。已经做到了在氢弹中人工地再现这种反应。任务就是要学会调节和控制这种猛烈的反应过程。做到这点，就可以使人类永远不要再去为能的来源问题操心。要知道，氢在自然界分布极广，它的储量实际上是取之不尽的。
    那些过去几百年人类只是在神话中想像的事情，现在有很多已经实现了。任何狂热的幻想都跟不上日新月异的现代科学。中世纪的炼金术士为了把一种物质变成另一种物质而枉费苦心。过了些时人们由于认为这个理想根本不能实现而放弃了它。但是到本世纪，发现核的反应能使氮变成碳，碳变成氧，铝变成磷，金变成汞。也能把汞变成金。但是现在摆在科学面前的是更加引人入胜的前景。
    任何一种元素现在都能制成放射性元素。放射性同位素的化学性能同该项元素完全一样。它们的区别仅仅在于原子量和放射性辐射能力。到五年计划结束时，苏联的原子锅炉中放射性同位素的数量将达到相当于一万吨镭的能量。有了丰足的放射性同位素，就能把它们大量地用于国民经济的各个方面。这些物质的利用，是建立在采用各种自动装置和控制仪器的基础上的。这些以前在自然界不存在的奇异的元素，使人们有可能研究合金中金属的相互作用，机器上磨擦部件的损耗，动植物有机体中发生的生物过程。科学家在普通的磷或碳中掺上少许磷或碳的放射性同位素，观察这些元素在植物的叶部和动物或人的血液中如何行动。这就是在生物学中实行真正革命的所谓“示踪原子法”。
    用放射性同位素辐射过的种籽能增加很多产量。为了防止马铃薯在一年的时间内发芽，只要用放射性钴辐射一下就行了。一个安瓿的这种放射性钴在另一种仪器中就能察看炼铁炉的过程并且将把昂贵而笨重的X射线装置从技术和医学中排挤出去。
    医生们得到了一种同某些药物无能为力的疾病作斗争的强有力的武器。一剂内服的放射性磷就能使红血球增多症这种严重的血液疾病停止。人类的长期灾难——恶性肿瘤，在已经掌握了原子辐射的奏效神速的力量的先进科学的进攻下，正在逐渐退却。镭疗法曾经拯救了几千个由于可怕的疾病而注定要死去的病人。不久以前，用镭来治疗还只是在个别最大的学院里才能办到。而现在，苏联全国各城市的许多医院都在成功地使用着放射性同位素。苏联创制的深部照射装置，能够治疗生在人体深处的肿瘤，如肺癌或骨瘤。
    这个简短而极不充分的叙述表明，解放了的原子能是多么迅速地在现在的科学和技术中为自己开拓道路。可以确有把握地预言，将来所有各种燃料都会为原子燃料所代替。要知道，铀和钍的蕴藏所含的能量相当于煤和石油总储藏能量的十倍到二十倍。
    再过不多几年，甚至在苏维埃国家的最边远地区，也将有强大的动力中心向企业和田野输送电流。沉睡在荒无人迹的丛林中和极地的冰层下面的丰富的有益矿藏，将为人类所享用。原子中心将日夜不停地送出能够使极地冰溶化并把沙漠变成花园的能的洪流。这些中心将会毫不困难地得到燃料。现在正在建造的原子破冰船将是流动的电力中心的先驱者，它们将供给北冰洋沿岸和伟大的西伯利亚诸河流下游区以能——热和光。装有原子发动机的潜水艇将在极地海洋的冰下行驶，而原子机车将在地面奔驰。这种具有七千马力的机车只装一次燃料就能行驶三万公里。将来，原子发动机也会用于汽车。可以想像，将会有一种电动车，它是用一种依靠同位素衰变获得电波的蓄电池来推动的。但是，装有原子反应器并配以喷气涡轮发动机的飞机将展现出最迷人的前景。这种飞机在同温层上面飞行，速度能够达到每小时一万到两万公里，飞越大洋和大陆只消个把小时。从北京到莫斯科或从华沙到海参崴的不着陆飞行，将会成为最简单最平常的事情。存在于我们的行星以外的新的天地，将为人类开放。原子反应堆能够创造出使星际火箭摆脱地心引力的喷射速度。人类最大胆的幻想将要实现：宇宙飞船打破了万有引力的桎梏，把地球上的居民带到月亮上去，然后又到太阳系的其他行星上去。而在这里，在地球上，原子爆炸的力量将使道路穿过群山，建立人工水库，掘开深藏地下的有益矿藏，并用把几百万立方公尺的岩石轰击到预定地点的办法建成堤坝。人们甚至可以改变气候。人们将改变海流和气流。例如，可以建一道横跨白令海峡的堤坝，把太平洋北部同北极冰隔离开来，以便改变堪察加和阿拉斯加的气候。
    现代科学所面临的任务是极其伟大而崇高的。这些任务的顺利完成是同争取禁止使用和试验一切类型的原子武器和热核子武器的斗争分不开的。
    忠于自己的和平合作政策的苏联，乐意同其他国家共享原子动力学方面的成就。不久以前签订的关于成立联合核子研究所的协议，在原子物理学的发展中揭开了新的一页。苏联人同伟大的中国人民和其他人民民主国家的人民一起，紧密地合作来着手解决原子动力学的重大问题，以便为和平和进步谋利益，为全人类谋幸福。
