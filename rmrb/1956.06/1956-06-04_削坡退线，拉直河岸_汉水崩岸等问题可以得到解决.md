Slope Reduction and Setback, Straightening Riverbanks
Problems such as the collapse of the Han River bank can be solved
Soviet expert Sonorovich from the Ministry of Urban Construction inspected Wuhan's flood control and drainage projects from May 16th to 24th and helped solve the technical problems of Han River bank collapse treatment, levee soil pressure calculation, and prevention of erosion on both sides of the confluence of the Han River and the Yangtze River, which had not been resolved in the past few years. He suggested local slope reduction and bank protection in the collapsing areas, and building dams upstream to straighten the very curved riverbanks appropriately, forcing the turbulent mainstream into the river to prevent erosion on both sides. The Hankou bank at the confluence of the Han River and the Yangtze River is suffering from severe erosion. He pointed out that the Hanyang bank should be reduced in slope and set back, and the water surface should be widened to accommodate the highest flood flow and ensure that the bank is not eroded. He also suggested installing inverted filter equipment at the foot of the inner slopes of earth dikes throughout the city to prevent river water from infiltrating the dikes. (Wang Rushu)

    削坡退线，拉直河岸
    汉水崩岸等问题可以得到解决
    城市建设部苏联专家索诺洛维奇于五月十六日至二十四日视察了武汉市的防洪排渍工程，并帮助解决了过去几年所没有解决的汉水崩岸治理、堤防土壤压力计算和防止汉水和长江汇合口的两岸被冲涮的技术问题。他建议在崩岸的地方进行局部削坡、护岸，和在上游建坝，将弯曲很大的河岸适当拉直，把湍急的主流逼向江中，防止两岸遭受冲涮。在汉水和长江汇合口处的汉口岸受到很严重的冲涮，他指出应在汉阳岸削坡退线，并使水面加宽，以容纳最高洪水流量，保证岸壁不被冲涮。他还建议在全市土堤内坡脚普遍设置倒滤设备，以防止江水浸润堤防。（王儒述）
