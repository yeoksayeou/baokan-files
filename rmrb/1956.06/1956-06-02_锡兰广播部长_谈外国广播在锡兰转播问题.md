Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 1st: Ceylon's Minister of Posts, Telecommunications, Broadcasting and Information, Mr. Marikar, said on May 30th that it would be "unfair to only allow the rebroadcast of 'Voice of America' broadcasts in Ceylon and not allow those countries eager to rebroadcast their own broadcasts to enjoy the same facilities." He said, "Even if Russia or China comes to rebroadcast their broadcasts, I wouldn't care as long as they abide by the contracts they have signed." He went on to say that he would insist that the scripts must first be approved by him, and this is also the case with "Voice of America" broadcasts.

Marikar also announced that the ten-year agreement concluded between the former Kotelawala government and the United States in 1952 regarding "Voice of America" broadcasts would continue to be in effect until 1962.

    锡兰广播部长
    谈外国广播在锡兰转播问题
    新华社1日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰邮电、广播和宣传部长马里卡尔在五月三十日说，在锡兰“只允许转播‘美国之音’的广播而不允许那些急于要转播它们自己的广播的国家享有同样的便利是不公平的”。他说：“即使俄国或是中国来转播它们的广播，我也并不在乎，只要它们遵守它们所订的合同。”他接着说：他将坚持稿件必须首先经他批准，“美国之音”的广播也是这样的。
    马里卡尔还宣布，前科特拉瓦拉政府和美国在1952年缔结的关于“美国之音”广播的十年协定将继续生效到1962年为止。
