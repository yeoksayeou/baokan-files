Xinhua News Agency, Ejin Horo, 23rd: The grand ceremony commemorating the 729th anniversary of Genghis Khan was held this afternoon in the newly completed Genghis Khan Mausoleum Park in Ejin Horo, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ik Zhao League.

Ha Feng'a, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, representatives from various leagues and administrative regions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and from Hohhot and Baotou cities, as well as over ten thousand farmers and herdsmen of various ethnic groups, participated in the grand ceremony.

Also attending today's grand ceremony was Peng Sike, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, who came from Beijing.

As the grand ceremony began, the chief celebrant, Ha Feng'a, presented Hada scarves, milk, wine, and a sheep's back to the spirit of Genghis Khan. The accompanying celebrant, Peng Sike, and representatives from various regions presented gifts successively.

The Genghis Khan Mausoleum Park is newly built. The completion ceremony was held at noon today. More than ten years ago, the Kuomintang reactionaries looted the coffin of Genghis Khan. In 1954, with the care and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the coffin was welcomed back from Qinghai, and this new mausoleum park was built with huge sums of money. The mausoleum buildings are divided into a memorial hall, a rear sleeping palace, and left and right exhibition halls, where the coffin, military flags, saddles, and other items are displayed in accordance with the style of the old mausoleum.

The Genghis Khan Grand Ceremony used to be held on the twenty-first day of the third month of the lunar calendar.

Because the climate was cold at that time, it was inconvenient for the masses to participate. After soliciting opinions from the masses, the Inner Mongolia Party and government organs decided that, starting this year, it would be held on the fifteenth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar.

    成吉思汗大祭在伊金霍洛举行
    据新华社伊金霍洛23日电　成吉思汗七百二十九周年大祭今天下午在内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟伊金霍洛新建成的成吉思汗陵园里举行。
    内蒙古自治区副主席哈丰阿，内蒙古自治区各盟、行政区和呼和浩特、包头市代表，以及各族农牧民一万多人参加大祭。
    参加今天大祭的，还有从北京赶来的中华人民共和国民族事务委员会办公厅副主任朋斯克。
    大祭开始，主祭人哈丰阿在成吉思汗灵前献哈达、奶子、酒和羊背等。陪祭人朋斯克和各地代表先后献礼。
    成吉思汗陵园是新建成的。今天中午举行了落成典礼仪式。十多年以前，国民党反动派曾把成吉思汗灵柩掠走。1954年，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的关怀和帮助下，灵柩才从青海迎接回来，并且用巨款修建了这座新陵园。陵园建筑分纪念堂、后寝宫和左右陈列馆，里面灵柩、军旗和马鞍等都是按照旧陵园的式样陈设的。
    成吉思汗大祭过去是在旧历三月二十一日举行。
    因为当时气候寒冷，群众参加不便。内蒙古党政机关向群众征求意见后，决定从今年起，改在旧历五月十五日举行。
