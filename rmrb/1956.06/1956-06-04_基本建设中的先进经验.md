    Advanced Experiences in Basic Construction
    The "Piecemeal Drawing" Method Which Increases Efficiency by 3.6 Times
    The problem of design in basic construction not keeping up with the needs of construction has existed for a long time. In order to solve this problem, the Baoding City Construction Engineering Bureau, in addition to widely adopting standard designs and reusing drawings extensively, has also adopted the "piecemeal drawing" method. Preliminary trials have shown that it can increase design efficiency by 3.6 times. For example, the design for eight units of the Baoding Civil Affairs Bureau, totaling 7,270 square meters, would have required 76 drawings and 260 work hours using the old method. Using the piecemeal method, it only required drawing a plan view and supplementary drawings totaling 14 drawings and 72 work hours (including review).
    Compiling piecemeal drawings involves designing various types of drawings based on the project cost, structural form, and building nature. This includes drawing single-sheet drawings with different spans, spacing, roof forms, roof frame structures, interior clear heights, brick wall thicknesses, door and window cross-sectional dimensions, foundation widths, etc. (with construction methods noted), classifying and numbering them, and then storing them. Based on the construction unit's stated building nature and requirements, cost standards, a simple plan view and elevation are made. The required numbers are extracted from the pre-made type drawings and detailed drawings, pieced together to form a complete design drawing, and after review and confirmation, the cost can be estimated. Old data can also be used for estimation. Therefore, much time is saved in design estimation and structural calculations, accelerating the progress of design and estimation.

  Pre-stressed Reinforced Concrete Roof Truss Beam
    Based on the national architectural science research plan and learning from advanced Soviet experience, the Architectural Technology Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction successfully trial-produced an 18-meter integrated pre-stressed roof truss beam on March 30, ahead of schedule. This type of building structure is the latest technological achievement of the Soviet Union, suitable for industrial building construction, and has the advantages of pre-stressed reinforced concrete structures. Its characteristics are: the tensioning equipment is simple, suitable for production in open-air prefabrication plants. The use of this structure can save a large amount of steel. For example, for an 18-meter steel roof truss, the steel consumption is 1,530 kg, while this type of roof truss beam only uses 625 kg of steel, saving more than 60% of steel. At the same time, the price of shaped steel is more than 10% higher than that of rebar, and the labor and material cost per piece can be reduced by about 50%.
        Dry-Hardened Concrete
    In construction engineering, concrete accounts for a large proportion of the total usage. Therefore, how to fully utilize the activity of cement and ensure that the cement usage in each cubic meter of concrete is minimized will have significant political and economic implications.
    Last year, the North Manchuria Construction Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry first adopted the new Soviet technology of dry-hardened concrete. The advantages of using dry-hardened concrete are: it greatly saves cement consumption, reduces harmful excess water in the concrete; lowers the water-cement ratio, the strength is 40%-80% higher than that of plastic concrete with equal cement consumption, and shortens the hardening period or heat treatment period of products under natural conditions by one-third to one-half; it allows early demolding, accelerating the turnover rate of formwork; and improves the density, water resistance, and frost resistance of the concrete.
    According to the experience of the North Manchuria Construction Company, in the manufacture of 140-grade concrete, approximately 50 kilograms of cement can be saved per cubic meter, the curing period is shortened by one-half, and the cost is reduced by 30%.

    基本建设中的先进经验
    提高效率三点六倍的拼凑图法
    基本建设的设计赶不上施工的需要，是长时期存在的问题。为了解决这个问题，保定市建筑工程局除了广泛采用标准设计，大量重复使用图纸外，并采用了拼凑图法。经初步试用，可以提高设计效率三点六倍。如对保定市民政局八个单位共7，270平方公尺的设计，照旧法设计需用七十六张图纸和二百六十个工时，采用拼凑法，只需要绘制平面图和必须补充的图纸十四张和七十二个工时（包括审核）。
    编制拼凑图纸，就是根据工程造价，结构形式和建筑性质，设计出多种类型图，分别绘出不同的跨度、间距、屋面形式、房架结构、室内净高、砖墙厚度、门窗断面尺寸、基础宽度等单纸图纸（并注明施工作法），加以分类编号，再根据工程类型及建筑用途、结构、性质、作出各种大样。如门窗大样、台阶大样、顶棚大样等等，然后分别编号储存。根据建设单位所提出的建筑性质和要求、造价标准，仅作平面图及简单的立面，按所需的编号从已制好的类型图及大样图中抽出，经拼凑即成一完整的设计图纸，再经审核无误，即可估算造价。估算时也可利用旧资料。所以在设计估算及结构计算上都节省了很多时间，加速了设计和估算的进度。

  预应力钢筋混凝土屋架梁
    建筑工程部建筑技术研究所，根据国家建筑科学研究计划，在学习苏联先进经验的基础上，于三月三十日提前试制成了十八公尺整体式预应力屋架梁。这种建筑结构是苏联最新的技术成就，适用于工业厂房建筑，具有预应力钢筋混凝土结构的优点。它的特点是：张拉设备简单，适合在露天预制厂制作。采用这种结构可以节约大量钢材。如以十八公尺的每根钢屋架来说，其钢材用量为1，530公斤，而这种屋架梁仅用钢材625公斤，可节约钢材60％多。同时型钢的价格比钢筋贵10％以上，每根工料成本约可降低50％左右。
        干硬性混凝土
    在建筑工程中，混凝土的用量占很大比重。因此，如何充分利用水泥的活性，和保证每一立方公尺混凝土中的水泥用量最小，就会具有重大政治经济意义。
    去年，重工业部北满建设公司，首先采用了苏联的新技术——干硬性混凝土。采用干硬性混凝土的优点是：大大节省水泥用量，减少了混凝土中有害的多余水份；降低了水灰比例，强度较水泥用量相等的塑性混凝土高40％—80％，并使制品在自然条件下的硬化期限或热处理的期限缩短三分之一到二分之一；可以早期脱模，加速模板的周转率；提高了混凝土的密实性、抗水性和抗冻性。
    根据北满建设公司的经验，在140号的混凝土的制造中，每一立方公尺可以节约水泥50公斤左右，养护期限缩短二分之一，降低成本30％。
