Xinhua News Agency, June 17th:  Wehner, Chairman of the West German Federal Parliament's Committee on All-German Affairs and a member of the Social Democratic Party, said, "The Cold War should also be stopped in Germany."

In an interview with a reporter from "Bonn Commentary News," Wehner also emphasized that Adenauer's attempt to oppose the policy of easing tensions with "tough words" is doomed to fail.

Wehner put forward three specific tasks for German policy:

First, do not take any actions that would hinder the relaxation of international tensions, especially do not implement conscription that would harm German reunification.

Second, actively support and assist in the limitation of armaments, the reduction of troop numbers, and the prohibition of atomic, chemical, and biological weapons, and actively support and assist in reaching an internationally supervised disarmament agreement.

Third, Germany should contribute to the cause of preparing for the conclusion of a European security treaty.

    西德议院全德事务委员会主席
    主张在德国停止冷战
    据新华社17日讯　西德联邦议院全德事务委员会主席、社会民主党人魏纳说：“冷战也应当在德国停止”。
    魏纳在对“波恩评论新闻”的记者发表的谈话中还着重指出：阿登纳企图用“强硬的言词”来反对缓和紧张局势的政策是注定要失败的。
    魏纳对德国政策提出三项具体任务：
    一、不要采取任何会阻挠缓和国际紧张局势的行动，特别是不要实行危害德国重新统一的征兵制。
    二、积极支持和协助限制军备、裁减军队人数和禁止原子武器、化学武器和生物武器，积极支持和协助达成有国际监督的裁军协定。
    三、德国应对筹备缔结欧洲安全条约的事业作出贡献。
