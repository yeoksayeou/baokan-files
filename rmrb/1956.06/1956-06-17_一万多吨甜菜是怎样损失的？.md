Not Permitted to Waste State Resources

    How Were More Than 10,000 Tons of Sugar Beets Lost?
    Editor:
    At the end of the last production year, Harbin Sugar Factory discovered that a large quantity of sugar beets had been lost beyond the planned amount. Deputy Factory Director Zhang Binsheng neither investigated the reasons for the loss nor asked for instructions from higher authorities, but arbitrarily approved the reimbursement of the loss in the production costs. Later, the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry discovered the shortage of 10,156 tons of sugar beets throughout the year from the factory's statistical data, and ordered the sugar factory to conduct an investigation. So, the sugar factory held a meeting. At this meeting, everyone shirked responsibility: the sugar production workshop said that the sugar beets were lost during storage; the storage department said that the sugar beets were wasted during production. In the end, the conclusion was: the loss was unavoidable and occurred every year. They wrote a "Sugar Beet Reduction Report" to the higher authorities, which stated: "This year's sugar beet loss is not too large, the natural loss is about 7,838 tons," and then pretended to make a perfunctory self-criticism, saying that "an analysis was made of the sugar beet loss, of which 249 tons could have been avoided..."
    In order to safeguard state property, the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Supervision conducted an inspection of this matter, and the results proved that most of the loss of this batch of sugar beets was man-made. For example, the factory was careless when washing the sugar beets, and a large number of sugar beets flowed into the Songhua River. From October 1954, more than one hundred people pushed wheelbarrows to salvage sugar beets from the sewage ditch leading to the Songhua River every day. The workers reported this situation to the factory director. The factory director did not take active measures, but only installed two grates at the mouth of the drainage ditch. In fact, the sugar beets still flowed into the river. It is estimated that about 1,400 tons of sugar beets were lost in this way. In addition, more than 6,000 tons of sugar beets were left for a long time on both sides of the four-mile-long railway track, exposed to the wind and sun. Also, large quantities of frozen sugar beets and non-frozen sugar beets were stored together. The straw curtains covering the sugar beets were either uncovered without being covered, or covered without being uncovered (according to regulations, they should be covered during the day and uncovered at night), which also caused large quantities of sugar beets to dry out, dissolve, and rot. After the factory discarded these damaged sugar beets, nearby farmers came in groups to pick them up. At this time, the factory sent people to the villages to criticize the farmers for being "too selfish." This aroused the farmers' dissatisfaction. They said: You throw away the sugar beets, and don't examine your own mistakes in not cherishing state property; but we pick up the sugar beets, and we are selfish!
    The farmers' criticism is correct. These more than 10,000 tons of sugar beets can be made into more than 1,000 tons of sugar. Why doesn't the Harbin Sugar Factory make a self-criticism?

### 一万多吨甜菜是怎样损失的？

    一万多吨甜菜是怎样损失的？编辑同志：
    哈尔滨糖厂在去年生产年度结束时，发现超计划损失了大批甜菜。副厂长张滨生既没有追查损失原因，也没有请示上级，就擅自批准在生产成本中报销了。后来，黑龙江省工业厅从糖厂统计资料中发现全年短少甜菜10，156吨的情况，就责成糖厂进行检查。于是，糖厂召开了一个会议。在这个会议上，大家都互相推卸责任：制糖车间说甜菜是在保管过程中损失的；保管部门说甜菜是在生产中浪费的。最后得出结论却是：损失不可避免，而且年年如此。他们给上级写了一个“甜菜减量报告”，其中说：“今年甜菜损耗量并不太大，自然损耗量约为7，838吨”，接着也装模作样地检讨了一句，说是“对甜菜的损耗作了分析，其中可以避免损失的有249吨……”。
    哈尔滨市监察局为了维护国家财产，对这件事进行了检查，结果证明这批甜菜的损失大部分是人为的。例如，这个工厂在洗刷甜菜的时候不小心，大批甜菜流到松花江里去了。从1954年10月起，每天就有一百多人推着小推车在通往松花江的污水沟边捞甜菜。职工曾把这一情况报告厂长。厂长并没有采取积极的措施，只是在流水沟口安设两道篦子，实际甜菜仍然往江里流。据估计，大约这样流失的甜菜有一千四百多吨。另外有六千多吨甜菜长期扔在四里多长的火车道两旁，任凭风吹日晒。还有大批冻甜菜和不冻甜菜混在一起保管。盖甜菜的草帘不是揭开无人盖就是盖上无人揭（按规定是白天盖上晚上揭开），这样也使大批甜菜风干溶化而霉烂了。在厂里把这些损坏的甜菜抛弃以后，附近农民就成群结队来拣。这时工厂却派人到屯子里去批评农民“太自私自利”。这引起农民的不满。他们说：你们扔甜菜，不检讨自己不爱护国家财产的错误；我们拣甜菜，倒是自私自利了！
    农民的批评是正确的。这一万多吨甜菜可以制成一千多吨糖。哈尔滨糖厂为什么不作检讨呢？
