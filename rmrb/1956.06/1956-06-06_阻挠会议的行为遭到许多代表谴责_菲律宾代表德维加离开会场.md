Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, 5th—Philippine delegate De Vega, attending the Asian-African Students Conference, left the venue this morning as the majority of delegates condemned his obstructionist behavior.

    At the start of the plenary session this morning, Egyptian delegate Hassab, in his capacity as Chairman of the Credentials Committee, announced that all delegations were qualified to participate in the conference.

    De Vega then spoke. He said that Hassab's report was "unfair" because many delegates did not come directly from their own countries to Bandung to attend the conference.

    De Vega's speech was opposed by many delegates, including Iranian delegate Yavad Vafa, who came directly to Bandung from the United States. Vafa said that many Asian and African countries do not have their own universities, so how can their students come directly from their own countries?

    Hassab said that De Vega had never done anything to help the conference convene when he was on the International Preparatory Committee. De Vega immediately and abruptly left the venue. Hassab said that the attempt to sabotage the meeting had failed.

    Before leaving the venue, De Vega warned that he would not be responsible if the meeting failed.

    The morning session was adjourned on the suggestion of the Indonesian delegation. After the meeting, ten chief delegates signed a joint statement requesting De Vega to return to maintain the peaceful atmosphere of the meeting.

    阻挠会议的行为遭到许多代表谴责
    菲律宾代表德维加离开会场
    新华社万隆5日电　出席亚非学生会议的菲律宾代表德维加今天上午在大多数代表谴责他的阻挠会议的行为的时候离开了会场。
    在今天上午全体会议开始的时候，埃及代表哈萨布以资格审查委员会主席的资格宣布，所有代表团都有资格参加会议。
    德维加随即发言。他说，哈萨布的报告是“不公平的”，因为许多代表都不是直接从他们自己的国家到万隆来参加会议的。
    德维加的发言遭到许多代表的反对，其中包括伊朗代表亚瓦德·瓦法，瓦法是直接从美国到万隆的。瓦法说，许多亚非国家没有他们自己的大学，它们的学生怎么能够直接从他们自己国家来呢？
    哈萨布说，德维加在国际筹备委员会里的时候从来没有做过任何有助于会议的召开的事情。德维加当即突然离开了会场。哈萨布说，破坏会议的尝试已经失败。
    德维加在离开会场之前警告说，如果会议失败，他不负责任。
    上午会议在印度尼西亚代表团建议下休会。会后十位首席代表签署了一个联合声明，要求德维加回来以保持会议的和平气氛。
