Representative Sun Xiaocun's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives,

I listened with joy and excitement to the "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget" by Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian, as well as the reports and speeches by other leading comrades. I fully agree with the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget.

This year's national budget is the largest in terms of revenue and expenditure since the founding of New China. The characteristic of the revenue side is that the income from state-owned enterprises has grown particularly rapidly, ranking first in revenue. The characteristic of the expenditure side is that economic construction expenditure not only remains in first place as in the past few years, but the amount is particularly large, accounting for more than half of the total budget expenditure. In addition, the budget also shows a more reasonable proportional relationship between the development of heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, and transportation than in the past. It demonstrates great emphasis on cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings, as well as a high degree of concern for the people's livelihood. This budget reflects the tremendous development of our national economy and the rapid growth of material strength in the six years since our country has been under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. It reflects the superiority of the people's democratic system and the role of the basic economic laws of socialism, and it points out the grand and distant prospects of our country's socialist construction.

I am a staff member of a university. Below, please allow me to offer two opinions on the implementation of the budget for social, cultural, and educational departments:

	Instruments and Equipment Unavailable

First, this year's national budget shows a significant increase in higher education funding, reaching 139.61% of 1955, and scientific funding has increased even more, reaching 253.27% of 1955. A large part of these funds is used to purchase instruments, equipment, and research materials. But what is the current situation? I don't know about other places, but in Beijing and Tianjin, the shortage of goods on the market is very serious. To facilitate explanation, please allow me to give a few examples: Beijing Agricultural University has a meteorology course, and an agricultural meteorology department will be established in the second half of the year, but for several months we have not been able to buy the automatic temperature recorders and automatic humidity recorders that are essential for meteorological teaching and research. The Department of Agricultural Economics wanted to buy 14 computers, but after running all over the markets of Beijing and Tianjin for half a year, from the Beijing Cultural Goods Company to the Tianjin Red Star Factory, we couldn't find a single one. In addition, there are similar situations with veterinary obstetrics equipment, certain physical and chemical instruments. Even more serious is the shortage of commonly used chemical laboratory rubber tubing, glass instruments such as 60CC white dropping bottles, specimen bottles, and specimen jars. This is the situation domestically. As far as I know, overseas orders have not been done very well in recent years. As everyone knows, scientific work cannot be separated from instruments and equipment, and the current shortage has seriously affected teaching and scientific research work. Today, as we are marching towards science in a big way, this problem deserves our serious attention. I suggest that the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education invite relevant industrial and commercial departments to quickly organize a certain amount of manpower to study this problem, propose solutions, and not only enable the relevant figures in this year's budget to become concrete construction, but also make fundamental plans for the future.

	Many Difficulties in School Construction

Second, the number of students enrolled in universities this year will reach more than 380,000, an increase of more than 90,000 compared to 1955. For this reason, a large part of this year's higher education funding is used for capital construction. According to several years of experience, a university has to deal with three parties before building a house: the competent department of the Ministry of Higher Education, urban planning agencies, and design agencies. In order to be responsible to the country, these units sometimes advocate thrift, some emphasize urban appearance, and some emphasize aesthetics. This spirit of responsibility and enthusiasm are good, but the regret is that sometimes everyone considers their own requirements too much and considers the characteristics of the school too little. For example, the unit time for work and study in a university is not calculated in half days but in hours, and thousands of teachers and students have to go up and down and in and out every hour, so the number of floors of the building should not be too high, three floors is generally the best. Also, teaching and scientific research work require quiet, and precision instruments are afraid of vibration and dust, so they should not be near the street. Also, classrooms and laboratories have hundreds or thousands of students attending and leaving class every day, and these students are all young people in their 20s, and they cannot walk as slowly and calmly as the elderly. They are always bouncing and jumping, so the vibration rate and wear rate of the buildings are particularly high, so the quality must be required to be higher and the unit price must be required to be higher. In the 1955 final accounts, only 82.82% of the budget for cultural and educational expenditures was used. While affirming that the savings were good, we must also point out that some capital construction projects were of poor quality because the unit price was too low. Some classrooms were already dilapidated after only one year of use, and some teachers' dormitories became "one child cries at night, and the four neighbors are uneasy" because soundproofing equipment was omitted. Also, building this year and enrolling students this year, experience has proven that it not only makes the school flustered, but also seriously affects the quality of the project. In the past, we had to do this, but we should consider changing it in the future. In short, a university is like a factory and has its own particularities. The principles of thrift, urban appearance, aesthetics, and other principles must be combined with the specific tasks to be completed by this specific object when implemented, so that it truly conforms to the country's policy of "practicality, economy, and beauty."

It is the responsibility of every state cadre to conscientiously implement the 1956 national budget. As a staff member of the higher education department, I will definitely work hard in my own work post to implement this socialist construction budget in accordance with the spirit indicated in the report of Vice Premier Li Xiannian and the reports and speeches of the leading comrades!

### 孙晓村代表的发言

专栏：

    孙晓村代表的发言主席、各位代表
    我以欢欣鼓舞的心情听了李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”和各位首长的报告和发言，对于1955年的国家决算和1956年的国家预算，表示完全同意。
    今年的国家预算是新中国成立以来收支数字最巨大的一个预算，收入方面的特点是国营企业的收入增长得特别快，占收入中的第一位；支出方面的特点是经济建设的支出不但同过去几年一样占居首位，而且数字特别大，占到全部预算支出的一半以上。此外，预算中还表现出重工业、轻工业、农业和交通运输等生产事业的发展保持着一种比过去更为合理的比例关系，表现出对文化教育科学事业的极大的重视，以及对人民生活的高度的关切。这个预算反映了我们国家在中国共产党的领导下六年多来国民经济的巨大发展和物质力量的迅速增长，反映了人民民主制度的优越性和社会主义基本经济规律所起的作用，指出了我国社会主义建设的宏伟景远。
    我是高等学校的一个工作人员，下面，请允许我就社会文教部门的预算执行方面提出两点意见：
      仪器设备买不到
    第一，今年国家预算中高等教育经费有显著的增长，为1955年的139.61％，科学经费增加得更多，为1955年的253.27％。这两笔经费中有很大的一部分是用于购置仪器设备和研究材料的。但目前的情况怎样呢？别的地方，我不知道，以北京、天津来说，市场上缺货的情况十分严重。为便于说明起见，请允许我举几个例子：北京农业大学有气象课，下半年还要成立农业气象系，但几个月来我们想买气象教学和研究上所必不可少的自记温度计、自记湿度计都没有买到；农业经济系要买14架计算机，结果是半年以来跑遍京、津两个市场，从北京文化用品公司到天津红星工厂，连一架都没有买到。此外，兽医产科器械、物理和化学的某些仪器都有同样情形。更严重的甚至化学实验室常用的胶皮管、玻璃仪器如60CC的白色滴瓶、标本瓶、标本缸等也都缺货。这是国内的情形，国外订货方面，就我所知，这几年来也没有做得很好。大家知道，科学工作不能离开仪器设备，而目前这种缺货现象已严重地影响教学工作和科学研究工作，在向科学大进军的今天，这个问题值得我们给予重大的注意。我建议中国科学院和高等教育部约请有关的工业部门和商业部门迅速组织一定的人力研究这个问题，提出解决的方案，不但要使今年预算中有关这方面的数字能成为具体的建设，而且要作出今后的根本打算。
      学校建筑困难多
    第二，高等学校在校学生今年将达38万余人，比1955年增加9万余人，为此，今年高教经费中有很大一部分是用于基本建设的。根据几年来的经验，一个高等学校要造房子，在施工前要与三个方面打交道，即高等教育部主管司，城市规划机构和设计机构。这些单位为了对国家负责，有的主张节约，有的强调市容，有的重视美观。这种负责精神和积极性都是好的，遗憾的是有时大家考虑自己的要求过多，考虑学校的特性太少。例如一个高等学校的工作与学习的单位时间不是按半天而是按小时计算的，每一小时就有千百位师生要上上下下，进进出出，所以房屋层次不宜太高，一般三层最好；又如教学与科学研究工作要求安静，精密仪器怕震动，怕尘灰，所以不宜临街；又如教室、实验室每天有成百上千的学生上课下课，这些学生都是20来岁的青年，走起路来不可能像老年人那样规行矩步，从容不迫，他们总是蹦蹦跳跳的，因此房屋的震动率与损耗率都特别大，所以质量不能不要求高一些，单价不能不要求多一些。1955年决算中文教经费只用了预算的82.82％，我们在肯定节约得好的同时，还必须指出有一部分基本建设由于单价压得过低，质量差，有的教室才用了一年已显破旧，有的教师宿舍由于省掉了隔音设备，弄成“一儿夜啼，四邻不安。”还有，当年基建，当年招生，经验证明不但使学校手忙脚乱，还严重影响工程质量，过去不得不这样做，今后应该考虑改变。总之，一个高等学校和一个工厂一样有它的特殊性，节约、市容、美观以及其他各项原则在贯彻时必须与这个具体对象所要完成的特定任务相结合，这样才真正符合国家的“实用，经济，美观”的方针。
    认真执行1956年的国家预算是每个国家干部的责任，作为一个高教部门的工作人员，我一定根据李先念副总理的报告和各位首长的报告和发言中所指出的精神，在自己的工作岗位中为执行这个社会主义建设的预算而努力！
