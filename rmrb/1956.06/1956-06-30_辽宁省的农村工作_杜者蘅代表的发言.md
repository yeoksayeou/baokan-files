    Liaoning Province's Rural Work
    ——Speech by Representative Du Zheheng
      I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I will only make a brief statement on some issues concerning rural work in Liaoning Province.
    (1) According to the CCP Central Committee's resolution on agricultural cooperativization and Chairman Mao's report on the question of agricultural cooperativization, our province has conscientiously criticized right-leaning conservative thinking. The number of peasant households participating in cooperatives has increased from the original 31% of total peasant households to 98.4% by the end of March this year. Among them, advanced cooperatives account for 89.3% of total peasant households. That is to say, our province has basically achieved full socialist cooperativization. It is expected that this autumn, the small-scale peasant economy in rural areas will be entirely replaced by the collective economy of advanced cooperatives.
    After cooperativization, the new relations of production in rural areas have provided enormous possibilities for improving agricultural productivity and developing agricultural production. The publication of the Central Committee's 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program (draft) has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for production and further promoted the rise of a production upsurge. Our province generally started production activities earlier this year, with spring plowing and sowing starting about 10 days earlier than in previous years. At present, we have entered the stage of intensive summer hoeing. Various measures to increase production, with the exception of waterwheels and water pumps, have generally been completed or are nearing completion according to plan. This will undoubtedly provide important technical and material guarantees for achieving increased agricultural production this year. However, there are still many problems in agricultural production in our province. After criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking in some areas, a mentality of impatience and rash advance has emerged to varying degrees. In addition, the provincial leadership failed to make unified plans for the 40 articles of the National Agricultural Development Program in a timely manner, and instead, various systems handed them down separately. As a result, there was "layer upon layer of additions, and every article was brought forward in time." The soundness and reliability of various production increase targets were also not sufficiently adequate, which fueled blindness at the lower levels. In particular, excessively high and hasty demands were made on non-production indicators in the 40 articles, which added a great burden to the cooperatives. Although this problem was quickly corrected, it also caused some waste of manpower and materials. At the beginning of this year, the situation of excessively high production increase plans was very common. After several revisions, it came closer to a more reliable foundation. Judging from the current situation, it is possible to complete the task assigned by the Central Committee to produce a total output of 13 billion catties in our province. In the next few months, we will do everything possible to overcome natural disasters and strive to reach 15 billion catties, which is also possible with a 20% increase over last year.
    (2) The distribution of income in cooperatives is the result of the members' hard work throughout the year. Whether the cooperative can increase production and whether individual income can increase has long become the most concerning issue for all members. Doing a good job in income distribution is not only a question of correctly handling the relationship between individual members and the collective, but also an important key to further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and consolidating and improving the cooperative. A recent survey of the trial calculation of income distribution in several counties this year shows that most societies can achieve increased production, and the income of about 90% of members will increase compared with before joining the cooperative. For example, in the Taiyangsheng Cooperative in Gaiping County, the total number of households in the cooperative is 2,403. This year, 2,243 households will increase their income, accounting for 93.6% of the total households in the cooperative; 75 households will not increase or decrease, accounting for 3.1%; and 79 households will decrease their income, accounting for 3.3%. From the perspective of class status, the income of general poor peasants, middle-middle peasants, and part of upper-middle peasants have increased or remained unchanged; the income of some upper-middle peasants and all new rich peasants have decreased to varying degrees; after the "Five Guarantees" are implemented for widowed and orphaned households, their income has increased compared with last year. Wang Zhengchang, an upper-middle peasant in the cooperative, has a family of eight, with two male and one female laborers. He has 110 fruit trees, with an income of 900 yuan from fruit trees last year, and 10 mu of land, with an income of 450 yuan. After deducting investment and agricultural tax of 200 yuan, his net income was 1,150 yuan. Because there are fewer fruit trees and more labor, the impact of the cancellation of remuneration for fruit trees is not significant. This year, he can work 520 workdays and earn 1,352 yuan, accumulate 300 piles of fertilizer, and earn 75 yuan. His family's total income is 1,427 yuan, 277 yuan more than last year, an increase of 24%. There are 91 upper-middle peasant households that increased their income in this way, accounting for 40% of the number of upper-middle peasant households in the cooperative. Another example is Sun Rongde, an upper-middle peasant, with a family of eight, two and a half laborers, and 4 mu of orchard. Last year, his fruit tree remuneration was 950 yuan, his workday income was 300 yuan, and his fertilizer accumulation income was 30 yuan. His family's total income was 1,280 yuan. This year, he can do 300 workdays and earn 820 yuan, plus the fertilizer accumulation income, his total income is 847 yuan, 432 yuan less than last year, a decrease of 34%. There are 64 households whose income has decreased in this way, accounting for 28% of the number of upper-middle peasant households. The reason for the decrease in income is mainly that there are fewer laborers, weaker laborers, and more fruit trees. After the cancellation of remuneration for fruit trees, income has decreased. There are 77 households that did not increase or decrease, accounting for 32% of the upper-middle peasants. It can be seen that even from the perspective of the upper-middle peasant class, the income of most people has increased or remained unchanged. Taking Gaiping County as an example, there are a total of 233 societies in the county (100% advanced), and 220 societies can guarantee increased income for every household this year, accounting for 94.4% of the number of societies in the county; 9 societies did not increase or decrease (the income of members increased or decreased), accounting for 3.8%; and 4 societies decreased their income, accounting for 1.7%. The reason for the decrease in income is still that some societies are small in scale and their production potential has not been fully utilized, and there has been waste in management.
    It seems that it is entirely possible for us to require more than 90% of the societies to increase production and increase income, and to strive for 90% of the members to increase their personal income. Taking the Taiyangsheng Society as an example, according to the results of the trial calculation of income distribution this year, 70% of the total income this year can be distributed to the members. According to a rough calculation, each household can receive an average of 951 yuan, which is 73% higher than the average of 550 yuan per household last year.
    Increasing production and increasing income depends to a large extent on good or bad management. As long as we conscientiously implement the policy of running societies diligently and frugally, give full play to production potential, do a good job in sideline production, and increase diversified operations, it is still possible to strive for those households that are expected to reduce income to not reduce income. In some areas of our province, there was once a relatively widespread phenomenon of extravagance, waste, and abuse of cooperative labor, which increased the expenses of the cooperative and placed an excessive burden on the members. In addition, at the beginning, excessive emphasis was placed on increasing grain and cotton production, and due attention and leadership were not given to sideline production, so that some societies did not do a good job in sideline production or did not do it at all, which reduced the cash income of the members and caused some members to doubt whether their income would increase this year, and also caused a relatively tight cash situation in rural areas. In the leadership of sideline production, some areas have one-sidedly emphasized collective management, believing that the decentralized management of members will affect the total income of the cooperative and are afraid of developing capitalism. In fact, there are still very few members who engage in sideline production on their own, and after cooperation, the main means of production have been collectively owned by the cooperative, and the tools of exploitation no longer exist. The worry that engaging in sideline production will develop capitalism is unnecessary. In particular, those small livestock such as pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese and household sideline businesses such as weaving, which farmers have always been accustomed to raising and managing in a decentralized manner, are of no benefit to over-emphasizing centralization. Of course, some sideline production must be done by the cooperative, but at present, it is still better to encourage members to engage in decentralized management when it does not affect labor within the society. In this way, the members can be directly and regularly guaranteed to have cash income, and the cooperative's financial burden can be reduced and the diversion of leadership energy can be avoided.
    In the distribution of income, in addition to paying attention to increasing income and reducing expenditure in management and increasing the income of the cooperative, we must also pay attention to controlling the ratio between the members' share of profits and public accumulation, and the three parties of the state, the cooperative, and the individual members must be taken into account. The draft regulations for advanced societies promulgated by the Central Committee have made clear provisions, which specifically embody the correct relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. This is fully in line with the actual situation in our province. Some of our societies once one-sidedly emphasized the consolidation of the society by expanding the accumulation of the cooperative and increasing public property. They did not realize the positive significance of consolidating the society by increasing the income of the members and encouraging the members' enthusiasm for production, which is not appropriate.
    The work of trial calculation and distribution of income has not yet been fully carried out in our province. According to the trial calculation experience of several societies in Gaiping, Haicheng and other counties, in order to do a good job in this work, it is necessary to calculate four accounts: (1) The production investment should generally be about 20% of the total income (including the construction labor). Don't engage in too much infrastructure construction. If too much is invested in the current year, it can be considered to be repaid in installments. (2) It is feasible that the production management cost accounts for about 1.5%. The management cost includes the subsidy for full-time cadres. The workday for the subsidy is calculated as part of the management fee. This way, it can be made clear that the more cadres there are and the more people who receive subsidies, the less personal profit the members will receive. To reduce management costs, we must first reduce the expenses of non-production personnel. According to our calculation, after deducting this part of the management labor cost, the administrative management cost is also about 0.5%. (3) The two items of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund should generally be controlled below 10%, but this year, in order to ensure that the members receive more, the public accumulation can be lowered, and it is relatively stable to be around 5%. (4) The agricultural tax is generally about 10%. Calculated in this way, more than 60% of the total income of each society can be distributed to the members. According to the actual trial calculation of several counties, the agricultural tax accounts for 4% of the total income of societies with many fruit trees and good diversified operations, and 7% of societies with large fields. After calculating the four accounts, what remains is the members' share of profits. This year, the production investment of the Xin'nongcun Cooperative in Haicheng County is 8.17%, the management fee (including cadre subsidies) is 1.9%, the two items of public accumulation are 5%, and the agricultural tax is 7%. The four accounts that belong to the state and the collective account for 31.7% of the total income, and the remaining 68.3% is used as the members' share of profits. The result of this trial distribution is that the first-class households can increase their income by 72% compared with last year, the general households can increase by about 20%-30%, and the households with the lowest income are guaranteed not to increase or decrease. The land of all classes in the big field societies is roughly average. After the cancellation of dividend distribution, no one has suffered losses, so the income of upper-middle peasants is still increasing.
      (3) There are also many problems in the political and ideological work of the cooperative. The outstanding problem is that the leading cadres of some societies are undemocratic in their work style, lack the idea of ​​relying on the members to run the society, and the phenomenon of coercion and command is more common, which seriously affects the internal unity of the society and the enthusiasm of the members for production. On the other hand, the members' sense of ownership of the society as their home is very insufficient, and some members are not enthusiastic about the work of the society and do not cherish public property enough. It is necessary to implement democratic management, promote the spirit of democracy, and rely on the members to run the society among the cadres. The Huangjin Township Cooperative in Liaoyang County could not solve the problem of funding for more than 40,000 catties of rice seeds before the spring plowing. In the past, the method of apportionment could not solve it. This time, the director of the cooperative used the method of relying on the members to solve the problem. Instead of apportioning it first, he first asked all the members to discuss how to solve it. As a result, more than 3,000 yuan was raised in less than a day, solving the problem of funding for rice seeds. It is very necessary to regularly conduct collectivist ideological education for all members and establish a sense of ownership with the society as their home. However, some problems cannot be overemphasized or exaggerated too early about everything unified adjustment and everything collective management. This is because we cannot deny that yesterday's individual farmers will still have a certain degree of petty selfishness and localism today. The example of the Huangjin Township Cooperative solving the problem of livestock fodder is enough to illustrate this situation. The livestock collectively raised by the society suffered from the problem of fodder not being solved. No one was willing to bring the fodder into the society for unified adjustment, so they changed to temporarily decentralizing the feeding to each production team, and each team solved the fodder problem by themselves. As a result, the fodder problem no longer existed.
    This year's task of increasing agricultural production is arduous, the completion of production increase measures is not good, the experience in running societies is insufficient, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste has appeared in the early stages, and natural disasters have begun to occur. We must work diligently, conscientiously implement the policy of running societies diligently and frugally, and mobilize all positive factors in order to obtain a large increase in agricultural production in the first year after cooperativization and ensure that members increase their income.

    辽宁省的农村工作
    ——杜者蘅代表的发言
      我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告、廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明和彭真副委员长所作全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。我仅就辽宁省农村工作方面的一些问题，作一简要发言。
    （一）根据中共中央关于农业合作化的决议和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告，我省认真的批判了右倾保守思想，参加合作社的农户已由原占总农户的31％发展到今年三月底为止的98.4％，其中高级社占总农户的89.3％，这就是说，我省基本上实现了全社会主义的合作化。预计今年秋季农村中的小农经济，即将全部为高级合作社集体经济所代替。
    合作化之后，农村中新的生产关系，为提高农业生产力、发展农业生产，提供了巨大的可能性。中央1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）的公布，更加鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性，进一步促进了生产高潮的增涨。我省今年生产行动普遍较早，春耕播种比往年提前了10天左右，目前已进入紧张的夏锄阶段。各项增产措施除水车、抽水机外，一般已按计划完成或已接近完成，这对实现今年农业增产，无疑的是重要技术和物质保证。但目前我省农业生产上还存在着很多问题；有些地区在批判了右倾保守思想之后，又在不同程度上产生了急躁冒进的情绪，加以在省领导上，对全国农业发展纲要的40条，未能及时做出统一规划，而由各系统分别下达，结果“层层追加，条条提前”，各项增产指标的稳妥和可靠性也不够充分，这就助长了下边的盲目性。特别是对40条内非生产指标，提出了过高、过急的要求，给合作社增加了很大的负担。这个问题虽然很快的纠正了，但也造成了一些人力、物力上的浪费。今年开始时增产计划过高的情况是很普遍的，后经几次修订，才接近了比较可靠的基础。就目前情况来看，完成中央要求我省总产量130亿斤的任务是可以保证。在今后几个月内，我们将尽一切努力战胜自然灾害，争取达到150亿斤，比去年增产20％也是有可能的。
    （二）合作社的收益分配，是社员一年辛勤劳动的结果，合作社能不能增产，个人收入能不能增加，早成了所有社员最为关切的问题。做好收益分配工作，不仅是正确处理社员个人同集体的关系问题，而且是进一步巩固工农联盟，巩固与提高合作社的重要关键。最近调查了几个县今年收益分配试算的情况是：一般的社都可达到增产，90％左右的社员收入将比入社前有所增加。如盖平县太阳升合作社，全社共2，403户，今年能增加收入的2，243户，占全社户数的93.6％；不增不减的75户，占3.1％；减少收入的79户，占3.3％。从阶级状况来看，一般的贫农、中中农和上中农的一部分，都增加收入或不增不减；部分上中农和全部新富农，收入都有不同程度的减少；鳏寡户实行“五保”后，收入都比去年增加。该社上中农王正昌，八口人，劳动力男二女一，有果树110棵，去年果树收入900元，土地10亩，收入450元，去掉投资和农业税200元，净收1，150元；由于果树较少，劳力多，果树取消报酬后，影响收入不大，今年能作520个劳动日可收入1，352元，积肥300堆，收入75元，全家共收入1，427元，比去年多收277元，增加24％。这样增加收入的上中农有91户，占该社上中农户数的40％。又如上中农孙荣德，八口人，劳力两个半，有果园4亩，去年果树报酬950元，劳动日收入300元，积肥收入30元，全家共收入1，280元；今年能做300个劳动日，可收820元，加上积肥收入共收847元，比去年少收432元，减少34％，这样减少收入的64户，占上中农户数的28％。减少收入的原因主要是劳力少，劳力弱，果树多，果树取消报酬后，收入就减少了。不增不减的有77户，占上中农的32％。由此可见，即使从上中农这个阶层来看，也是大多数收入有所增加或不增不减的。以盖平县为例，全县共233个社，（100％的高级化了），今年保证户户增加收入的有220个社，占全县社数的94.4％；不增不减的（社员收入有增有减）9个社，占3.8％；减少收入的4个社，占1.7％。减少收入的原因，还是由于有些社的规模较小，生产潜力发挥的不够，又加管理上的浪费所致。
    看来，我们要求90％以上的社增加生产，增加收入，并争取90％的社员增加个人收入是完全有可能的。仍以太阳升社为例，今年收益分配试算结果，可以将今年总收入的70％分给社员，粗略计算，每户平均能分到951元，比去年每户平均分550元，增加了73％。
    增加生产，增加收入，极大程度还取决于经营管理的好坏，只要认真贯彻了勤俭办社的方针，充分发挥生产潜力，搞好副业生产，增加多种经营，使那些预计减收户争取不减，也还是有可能的。我省有些地区曾一度发生较为普遍的铺张浪费和滥用合作社劳力的现象，使合作社开支增大，社员负担过重，加以开始过份强调了粮、棉增产，对副业生产未给予应有的重视和领导，以致有些社副业生产搞的不好或根本未搞，使社员减少了现金收入，引起了部分社员对今年增加收入产生了疑虑，也因此造成了农村现金较为紧张的情况。在副业生产的领导上，有的地区又片面的强调了集体经营，认为社员分散经营会影响合作社的总收入，又怕发展了资本主义。事实上社员自搞副业的仍很少，而且合作后，主要生产资料已归合作社集体所有，剥削工具已不存在，那种害怕搞副业发展资本主义的忧虑是不必要的。特别是那些农民一直习惯于分散饲养的猪、鸡、鸭、鹅等小家畜和编织等家庭副业，过分的强调了集中，也是没有好处的。当然，有些副业生产，合作社必须要搞，不过在目前一个时期，还是应该多鼓励社员在不影响社内劳动的情况下，分散经营为好。这样，才能直接的经常保证社员有现金收入，也减少了合作社在资金上的负担和避免领导精力的分散。
    在收益分配中，除了在经营管理上，注意开源节流，增加合作社收入外，同时也要注意到社员分益与公共积累间比例的控制，国家、合作社、社员个人，三者必须兼顾。中央颁发的高级社章程草案，已做了明确的规定，具体的体现了国家、集体和个人的正确关系问题，这是完全符合我省实际情况的。我们有些社开始曾片面的强调了以扩大合作社积累，增加公共财产的办法来巩固社，未认识到多从增加社员收入，鼓励社员生产积极性方面来巩固社的积极意义，是不妥当的。
    收益试算分配工作，在我省尚未全面展开，根据盖平、海城等县几个社的试算经验，为搞好这一工作必须算好四笔账：（1）生产投资一般应在总收入的20％左右（基建用工也包括在内），基建不要搞多了，如果当年投资过多的，可以考虑分年偿还。（2）生产管理费用占1.5％左右不算高，还是可行的，管理费用中包括了脱产干部的补贴，补贴的劳动日算作管理费的一部分，这样算作间接生产开支可以明确干部多了、受补贴的人员多了是会减少社员个人分益的。降低管理费，首先必须减少非生产人员的开支，我们这样计算，扣除这部分管理工费用，行政管理费也是在0.5％左右。（3）公积金、公益金两项，一般应控制在10％以下，但今年为保证社员多分，公共积累可编低些，在5％上下还是比较稳妥的。（4）农业税一般的也就是占10％左右。这样算下来，每社总收入的60％以上可以分配给社员。根据几个县的实际试算，果树多的及多种经营较好的社，农业税占总收入的4％，大田社占7％。算完四笔账，剩下的就是社员的分益部分，海城县新农村合作社，今年生产投资817.％，管理费（包括干部补贴）1.9％，公共积累两项5％，农业税7％，四笔账属于国家和集体的，占总收入的31.7％，其余68.3％作为社员分益。这样试分的结果，一等户能比去年增收72％，一般的可增20％—30％左右，收入最低的户也保证了不增不减。大田社各阶层土地大体平均，取消分红后，没有吃亏的，因此上中农仍是增加收入的。
      （三）合作社的政治思想工作，存在的问题也不少，突出的是有些社的领导干部作风不民主，缺乏依靠社员办社的思想，强迫命令现象较为普遍，严重的影响了社内团结和社员的生产积极性；另方面，社员以社为家的主人翁思想很不够，表现部分社员对社的工作不热情，对公共财产爱护不够。在干部中必须贯彻实行民主管理，发扬民主精神和依靠社员办社的思想。辽阳县黄金乡合作社春耕前缺4万多斤稻种的资金问题解决不了，以往用摊派的办法都不得解决，这次社主任运用了依靠社员解决问题的办法，不是首先摊派，而是首先交全体社员讨论如何解决，结果，不到一天时间就筹集了3，000多元，解决了稻种资金问题。对全体社员要经常进行集体主义思想教育，树立以社为家的主人翁思想，是十分必要的。但目前有些问题还不能过早或过分的强调一切统一调整，一切集体经营，这是由于我们不能不承认昨天的个体农民，今天还仍然会存在着一定程度的小私有和本位思想。黄金乡合作社解决牲口草料问题的事例，足以说明这种情况。他们由社集体饲养的牲口，苦于草料问题解决不了，谁也不愿把草料拿进社里来统一调整，于是他们改用由各生产队暂时分散饲养，草料由各队自己解决，结果草料问题就不复存在了。
    今年农业增产任务繁重，增产措施完成情况不好，办社经验不足，早期已出现了铺张浪费现象，加以自然灾害已开始发生，我们必须勤勤恳恳的努力工作，认真贯彻勤俭办社的方针，把一切积极因素都调动起来，才能够获得合作化后第一年的农业大增产，和保证社员增加收入。
