Xinhua News Agency report: New Chinese students who returned from the United States this year, He Guozhu, He Binglin, Chen Ruyu, and Liu Lisheng, have recently begun teaching and scientific research work at Nankai University.

He Binglin, who teaches in the Department of Chemistry, is researching "ion exchangers" in conjunction with his specialty. His wife, Chen Ruyu, is conducting research on a "phosphorus-containing insecticide" with high insecticidal efficiency. Since they came to the school in early April, the school has promptly prepared the conditions for scientific research for them and ordered special scientific instruments and equipment from abroad. Now, Chen Ruyu's parents and younger sister have also come to the school and are living happily with them.

He Guozhu, who teaches in the Department of Physics, is enthusiastically conducting a new research project to solve computational problems in the fields of nuclear physics and electron optics theory. The school has appropriately arranged his teaching work so that he can have more than 700 hours a year to engage in scientific research. He Guozhu's specialized course in electron optics is popular with students. Liu Lisheng, who studies biochemistry, has begun teaching the "Biochemistry" course in the Department of Biology.

He Binglin, who taught at Nankai University eight years ago, told reporters: "Today's Nankai University is simply unrecognizable to me. The number of students in science and liberal arts has increased tenfold compared to before liberation, and these specialized courses in the Department of Chemistry did not exist before. The progress of our country is really too fast."

    新从美国回国的留学生何国柱、何炳林等
    在南开大学开始教学和科学研究工作
    新华社讯　今年由美国回国的中国留学生何国柱、何炳林、陈茹玉和刘骊生，最近都在南开大学开始了教学和科学研究工作。
    在化学系任教的何炳林正结合他的专长研究“离子交换剂”。他的夫人陈茹玉正在进行一种杀虫效率很高的“含磷杀虫剂”的研究。他们从四月初来到学校以后，学校就及时给他们准备了科学研究的条件，并且向国外订购了专用的科学仪器设备。现在，陈茹玉的父母、妹妹也来到学校，和他们愉快地生活在一起。
    在物理学系任教的何国柱正兴致勃勃地进行一项新的解决原子核物理和电子光学理论方面计算问题的研究。学校已经适当地安排了他的教学工作，使他在一年内能有七百多个小时的时间从事科学研究。何国柱讲授的电子光学方面的专门化课程，受到学生们的欢迎。研究生物化学的刘骊生已经开始在生物学系讲授“生物化学”课。
    八年前曾在南开大学任教的何炳林对记者说：“今天的南开大学简直使我都不认识了，理科和文科的学生比解放前增加了十倍，化学系的这些专门化课程以前都没有。我们国家的进步实在太快了。”
