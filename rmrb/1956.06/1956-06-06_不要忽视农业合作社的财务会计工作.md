Do Not Neglect the Financial Accounting Work of Agricultural Cooperatives

A major problem currently prevalent in agricultural production cooperatives is that financial accounting work is not keeping up with the needs of production development. Many cooperatives have chaotic accounts, have not established necessary income and expenditure plans and systems, and the phenomenon of loss and damage to public property is quite common. Some cooperatives have even experienced incidents of corruption and embezzlement. This situation has caused concern and dissatisfaction among the vast number of cooperative members.

There are many objective reasons why the financial accounting work of many cooperatives has not been done well: there is a lack of accounting talent, and the level of professional skills is low; cooperatives have repeatedly expanded and merged, and property and accounts have changed many times. These practical difficulties are encountered by every cooperative, and are unavoidable in the initial stage of running a cooperative. However, as long as county and district leading cadres and cooperative leaders pay enough attention to it and earnestly strengthen leadership in this area, difficulties are not insurmountable. The problem is that many county and district leading organs, in leading agricultural production cooperatives, subjectively only pay attention to production issues and labor management issues, and do not pay attention to financial management issues. This has caused the financial accounting work of most cooperatives to fall into a state of "districts not inspecting, townships not managing, district and township cadres not understanding, and cooperative directors turning a blind eye." Therefore, in order to strengthen the leadership of the financial accounting work of cooperatives, the first thing to do is to thoroughly criticize all kinds of muddled ideas that neglect the financial accounting work of cooperatives.

"As long as production is done well, everything will be easy to handle, and financial accounting work is not important." People with this kind of muddled thinking separate production and financial work, "only care about production, not about finance," and even use full-time financial accounting instructors assigned by higher authorities as mobile cadres, completely abandoning leadership over this important work. In Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, there were four county-level full-time accounting instructors. One was transferred to the counter-revolutionary suppression office, one was transferred to be a clerk, and the other two were temporarily "assigned errands," going wherever people were needed. What is the situation of the financial accounting work of cooperatives in Jixian County? Of the county's 201 cooperatives, only one-third of the cooperatives have settled their old accounts, more than half of the cooperatives have very chaotic accounts, and multiple incidents of corruption and embezzlement have been discovered. Everyone, think about it, can production really be done well in such cooperatives? In order to smoothly develop the comprehensive production of cooperatives, it is not only necessary to rationally organize and use manpower, but also to rationally use materials and financial resources. Increasing income and reducing expenditure, and careful calculation, tapping the various potentials of the cooperative, is an important factor in guaranteeing increased production. However, without careful financial planning and a sound financial system, how can this be achieved?

"Financial accounting work is technical work, not political work. Accountants and instructors can handle it well, and leaders do not need to spend much energy." This is also a muddled idea. How do the cooperative members view financial accounting work? They say: "The rice bowl of our family is in the hands of the accountant. If the accounts are not done well, it will be a disaster." Financial accounting work is a major event that affects the vital interests of the vast number of cooperative members. Whether the distribution of the harvest of the cooperative is fair or not largely depends on whether the financial accounting work is done well. Can it be said that such things are technical work?

The neglect of financial accounting work by leading cadres has also caused many very bad results. Accountants and instructors encounter difficulties in their work and no one helps them to solve them. Some people are depressed and negative, feeling that financial work is not valued and has no future; others are afraid that funds and property will be lost and cannot take responsibility, and are even less at ease with this kind of work. Recently, accountants have resigned from their jobs in Jiaxing, Tongxiang, Yuyao, Chun'an, Kaihua and other counties in Zhejiang Province because they are not at ease with their work, causing a very bad influence.

Because there is no system for the inflow and outflow of money and lack of inspection and supervision, many people have become infected with the bad habits of corruption and waste. A recent inspection of 756 cooperatives in six districts of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, found that 520 cooperatives had incidents of corruption and embezzlement; among the 6,804 cooperative cadres in these cooperatives, 720 had corrupt behavior. Many cooperative backbone members have begun to degenerate, which is such a serious loss! What impact will it have on the unity and consolidation of the cooperative? If all of this is not political work, what else is political work?

There is also a muddled idea called "Anyway, the meat rots in the pot," "Everyone will bear it if the sky falls." This means that it doesn't matter if the accounts are unclear and the distribution is unreasonable, because the grain harvested is obtained by all the members, and it is all in the family whether you suffer a loss or gain an advantage. As for the loss and damage of public property and the waste of funds, it is even more irrelevant. "The cooperative is large and wealthy," how much can be allocated to each member? This idea is extremely harmful! It violates the principle of "to each according to his work, more work more gain" and violates the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. Guiding work with this kind of thinking will inevitably hinder the development and consolidation of cooperatives, so it must be corrected.

All rural work leading organs and staff should conduct a thorough inspection and rectification of the financial accounting work of cooperatives in conjunction with the summer harvest distribution of cooperatives. We should expand the sources of funds, reduce unnecessary expenditures, and reduce production costs from the aspect of revising or formulating financial income and expenditure plans; we should block various loopholes and eliminate corruption and waste from the aspect of establishing or improving financial systems. Otherwise, even if production increases, it may not be possible to guarantee that members' incomes will increase, and the consequences will be very bad.

### 不要忽视农业合作社的财务会计工作

    不要忽视农业合作社的财务会计工作
    农业生产合作社当前普遍存在的一个重大问题，是财务会计工作赶不上生产发展的需要。许多合作社账目混乱，没有建立必要的收支计划和制度，公共财物丢失损坏的现象相当普遍，有些合作社甚至发生了贪污舞弊的事件。这种情况，引起了广大社员的忧虑和不满。
    许多合作社的财务会计工作没有作好，有许多客观的原因：会计人材缺乏，业务水平又低；合作社一再扩大、合并，财产、账目屡次变动，这些实际的困难，是每个合作社都会遇到的，而且在办社初期是无法避免的。但是只要县、区领导干部和合作社的负责人给以足够的重视，切实加强这方面的领导，困难也是不难克服的。问题在于不少县、区领导机关，在领导农业生产合作社的时候，主观上就只注意生产问题和劳动管理问题，而不注意财务管理问题，这就使多数合作社的财务会计工作陷于“区不检，乡不管，区乡干部不懂，合作社主任不闻不问”的状态。因此，为了加强合作社的财务会计工作的领导，首先就要彻底批判忽视合作社的财务会计工作的各种糊涂观念。
    “只要搞好生产，一切都好办了，财务会计工作无关紧要。”有这种糊涂思想的人，把生产和财务工作截然分开，“只管生产，不问财务”，甚至把上级配备的专职财务会计辅导员当作机动干部使用，完全放弃了对于这个重要工作的领导。黑龙江省集贤县有四个县级专职会计辅导员，一个调到肃反办公室，一个调作文书，另外两个临时“支差”，哪里要人就到哪里去。集贤县合作社的财务会计工作的情况是怎样的呢？全县201个社，只有三分之一的社结清了旧账，半数以上的社账目很混乱，贪污舞弊事件已发现多起。大家想想，在这样的合作社中能够真正搞好生产吗？为了顺利发展合作社的全面生产，不只需要合理地组织和使用人力，而且需要合理地使用物力和财力。开源节流，精打细算，把合作社的各种潜力发掘出来，正是保证增产的一个重要因素。但是，如果没有周密的财务计划，健全的财务制度，怎样能够作到这一点呢？
    “财务会计工作是技术工作，不是政治工作，会计员、辅导员就能办好，用不着领导人员多费精力。”这也是一种糊涂观念。社员群众是怎样看待财务会计工作？他们说：“咱们一家人的饭碗操在会计手里，账要搞不好，那就坑杀人了。”财务会计工作是关系广大社员群众切身利害的大事，合作社的收获物分配的公平不公平，在很大程度上决定于财务会计工作好不好。能说这样的事情是技术工作吗？
    领导干部忽视财务会计工作，还造成许多很不好的结果。会计员、辅导员在工作上碰到困难，无人帮助解决。有的人苦闷消极，觉得财务工作不受重视，没有前途；有的人害怕资金财物受到损失，不能负起责任，更不安心这种工作。最近浙江省嘉兴、桐乡、余姚、淳安、开化等县都已发生过会计员因不安心工作而离职的现象，造成很坏的影响。
    由于银钱出入没有制度，缺乏检查和监督，不少的人已经沾染上贪污浪费的恶习。湖南省平江县最近对六个区756个社进行检查，发现五百二十个社发生贪污和挪用公款事件；在这些社的6，804个社干部中，有七百二十人有贪污行为。许多办社骨干开始蜕化变质，这是多么严重的损失！它对合作社的团结、巩固会发生什么影响呢？如果说这一切都不是政治工作，还有什么事情是政治工作呢？
    还有一种糊涂观念，叫做“反正肉烂在锅里”，“天塌下来大家顶着”。意思是说，账目不清楚，分配不合理，并没有多大关系，反正收的粮食是社员大家得了，吃亏沾光都是自己人。至于公共财物有了丢失损坏、资金发生浪费，更是无关紧要的。“合作社家大业大”，摊到每个社员名下，能够有多少呢？这种思想极其有害！它违背了“按劳取酬，多劳多得”的原则，违背了勤俭办社的方针。用这种思想指导工作，必然妨碍合作社的发展和巩固，所以必须纠正过来。
    所有的农村工作领导机关和工作人员，应当结合合作社的夏收分配，对合作社的财务会计工作进行一次彻底的检查和整顿。应该从修订或制定财务收支计划方面，扩大资金来源，紧缩不必要的开支，降低生产成本；从建立或健全财务制度方面，堵塞各种漏洞，杜绝贪污浪费。不然，即使生产增加了，也不一定能够保证社员增加收入，其后果会是很坏的。
