    Immediately Inspect and Improve the Quality of Water Conservancy Projects
    Driven by the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the nation's water conservancy construction has achieved great success. In the Yellow River basin, the Yangtze River basin, the Huai River basin, the North China water system, and provinces such as Hubei, Guangxi, and Qinghai, many large-scale irrigation projects, reservoirs, and temporary flood control projects have been completed or are under construction. The dikes of many rivers have been strengthened. These projects have played and will continue to play an important role in reducing water and drought disasters and ensuring agricultural harvests.
    The most rapidly developing and greatest achievements have been in farmland water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of May, more than 4.21 million wells had been drilled nationwide, more than 27,000 small reservoirs had been built, and more than 3 million ponds, dams, and other small water conservancy projects had been completed. These projects can expand the irrigated area by more than 150 million mu and improve the irrigated area by more than 70 million mu. This figure is equivalent to twice the total expansion of irrigated area in the six years since liberation.
    This year's water conservancy projects in various regions are generally good. However, because the projects were done quickly and the technical guidance could not keep up, some projects are of poor quality. The Xuchang area of Henan Province inspected the situation of 140,000 wells, of which 79% used the "liberation-style" waterwheel to draw water, and the water volume was sufficient; more than 10% of the wells were semi-finished products, using the "liberation-style" waterwheel to draw water, and the water dried up in one or two hours; 5% of the wells were of very low quality, and the wellbore was skewed and unusable. At the same time, although many wells have been drilled, water lifting tools cannot be supplied in time; the work of leveling the land, which is necessary for irrigating with well water, cannot keep up for the time being. Henan Province once made an estimate of the benefits of the newly built farmland water conservancy projects in the province based on typical investigations: if the completed wells, canals, ponds, small reservoirs, etc. are not repaired, the expanded irrigated area this year will be about 30 million to 35 million mu; if the projects that should be improved are improved in time, and the water lifting tools are fully equipped, and the land leveling work is done as much as possible, the irrigation benefits can be expanded to 45 million to 50 million mu. This shows that in the well-irrigated areas of the north, seizing the opportunity to inspect and improve the quality of wells and solving related problems in a timely manner is of utmost importance for preventing drought and flood disasters and increasing agricultural production.
    There is also a phenomenon of poor quality in water conservancy projects in the pond and dam irrigation areas of the south. Hunan Province inspected 688 newly built small reservoirs in the three areas of Shaoyang, Xiangtan, and Hengyang, and about 22% had relatively serious problems. Among them, about 10% did not open spillways or the spillways were opened too small; about 10% of the earth dams were not compacted, the side slopes were too steep, and there was a possibility of collapse; about 1.4% of the water outlet culverts had serious water leakage or had been broken; about 0.6% of the reservoirs had karst caves and could not store water. Most of these shortcomings can be made up for; however, if they are not repaired in time, the projects may be washed away in the event of heavy rain and mountain floods, causing major losses of farmland and even deaths and injuries to people and livestock.
    We have now entered the flood season, and many tributaries of the Pearl River, Huai River, and Yangtze River have already risen once. In some areas, the water level is even higher than in 1954. Whether in the south or the north, there is a possibility of drought during the intervals between floods. In order to ensure that the newly built water conservancy projects can play a positive role in preventing drought and flood disasters and increasing agricultural production, and to avoid unexpected disasters due to poor quality, all regions should immediately seize the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the newly built water conservancy projects, and immediately remedy and improve projects with poor quality.
    Our people have rich experience in fighting floods. We must carry forward past experience and take various effective measures to ensure the safety of major rivers during floods. This year, the Pearl River, Huai River, and some tributaries of the Yangtze River have come early and with large volumes of water. This year, the Huai River rose twenty days to a month earlier than in previous years of major floods, and the upstream mainstream flood exceeded the highest water level in 1954 at some stations. Therefore, it has created a very tense and passive situation for flood control work in many regions. The Party and government organs and water conservancy departments in various basins must take advantage of this valuable opportunity to take all possible measures to speed up the construction of unfinished projects, improve and consolidate projects with poor quality, and strengthen other aspects of flood control work to prepare for overcoming the sudden attack of floods.
    In the well-irrigated areas of the north, there is an intermittent period of time after the wheat harvest and before the autumn harvest that can be used to improve the quality of wells. Semi-finished wells with insufficient water output should be repaired and improved first. Lowering springs, drilling horizontal pipes, and deepening wellbores are all effective ways to increase water output, and various regions can adopt them according to specific circumstances. At present, the waterwheels and pumps produced by the state cannot meet the needs. In order to overcome the difficulty of lacking water lifting tools, provinces such as Liaoning, Hebei, Henan, Gansu, and Shandong have convened meetings with farmers, blacksmiths, carpenters, and technical cadres to study and improve the new or old water lifting tools created by the masses, and organize local handicrafts and supply and marketing departments to produce and sell them. In order to effectively exert the benefits of wells, it is necessary to level the land in time and establish a field irrigation system in order to save water and expand the benefits of irrigation. The amount of work required for this work is very large, and some places cannot complete it in one or two years. Various regions can proceed gradually from rough to fine according to the difficulty of the terrain and the needs of cultivation.
    In the pond and dam irrigation areas of the south, special attention should be paid to checking the quality of the earth dams of reservoirs and ponds; the upstream catchment area and the size of the spillways should be well calculated, and the water outlet culverts, opening and closing equipment, spillways, and downstream scour protection equipment of the culverts should be checked for firmness; all those that do not meet the standards should be repaired immediately. Some regions combine inspection, evaluation, and acceptance work, conduct inspection, evaluation, or demonstrative acceptance jointly by relevant personnel of several projects, publicize engineering quality standards, and strengthen mass supervision, which are all methods that can be promoted. In order to avoid major disasters caused by floods destroying reservoirs and ponds, it is necessary to formulate management systems for water storage and release, assign special personnel to be responsible for management, and pay attention to resolving the contradiction between flood control and irrigation water storage.
    Everyone understands how important it is to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year for the development of our national economy and for consolidating the existing agricultural cooperatives. Everyone also understands that doing a good job in water conservancy and preventing drought and flood disasters is an important key to ensuring a bumper harvest this year. In order to develop water conservancy, we have invested huge labor and funds and have achieved preliminary results. Party and government leading organs at all levels must build on this foundation, make another effort, lead the masses to inspect and improve the quality of projects, and solve related problems in a timely manner, so that all the newly built water conservancy projects can play their role.

    立即检查和改善水利工程的质量
    在农业合作化高潮推动之下，全国的水利建设取得了很大的成就。黄河流域、长江流域、淮河流域、华北水系和湖北、广西、青海等省，已经修成和正在修建许多大型灌溉工程、水库和临时防洪工程。许多河流的堤防都加强了。这些工程对于减轻水、旱灾害，保证农业丰收，已经发生了并将要继续发生重要的作用。
    发展最迅速、成绩最巨大的是农田水利工程。据不完全的统计，到五月底，全国已经打成水井421万多眼，修成小型水库二万七千多座，修成塘坝和其他小型水利工程三百多万处。这些工程共可扩大灌溉面积一亿五千多万亩，改善灌溉面积七千多万亩。这个数字相当于解放六年来全国扩大灌溉面积的两倍。
    今年各地的水利工程，基本上都是良好的。但是，因为工程作的很快，技术指导力量配合不上，也还有一些工程的质量低劣。河南省许昌专区检查了十四万眼井的情况，其中有79％用解放式水车汲水，水量可以够用；百分之十几的井是半成品，用解放式水车汲水，一两小时水就干了；有5％的井质量很低，井筒歪偏不能使用。同时，井虽然打的不少，提水工具却不能及时供应；配合井水灌溉所必需的平整土地的工作，一时也跟不上去。河南省曾经根据典型调查，对全省新修的农田水利工程的效益作过一番估计：如果已经打成的水井、渠塘、小水库等不再进行修理，今年扩大的灌溉面积约有三千万至三千五百万亩；如果对于应该改善的工程及时地加以改善，同时把提水工具配备齐全，整地工作也尽可能地做好，就可使灌溉效益扩大到四千五百万至五千万亩。这就可以看出，在北方井灌地区，抓紧时机检查和改善水井的质量，及时解决有关的问题，对防止旱涝灾害，增加农业生产，有极为重要的意义。
    南方塘坝灌溉地区的水利工程，也有质量低劣的现象。湖南省检查了邵阳、湘潭、衡阳等三个专区新建的688座小水库，有比较严重的问题的约占22％。其中未开溢洪道或者溢洪道开得过小的约占10％；土坝夯打不实，边坡过陡，有崩裂可能的约占10％；放水涵管严重漏水或者已经折断的约占1.4％；库内岩石有溶洞不能蓄水的约占0.6％。这些缺点，多数都是可以弥补的；但是，如果不及时修整，遇到暴雨山洪，就可能把工程冲毁，造成冲毁田地甚至死伤人口牲畜的重大损失。
    现在已经进入伏汛时期，珠江、淮河和长江的许多支流，都已一度涨水。某些地区水位之高，甚至超过1954年。无论南方北方，在洪水间隙期间，都有发生干旱现象的可能。为了使新修的水利工程都能在防止旱涝灾害、增加农业生产方面发挥积极的效用，避免因为质量不好造成意外灾害，各个地区应该立即抓紧时机，把新修的水利工程作一次全面的检查，对质量不好的工程，立即加以补救改善。
    我国人民具有丰富的和洪水作斗争的经验。我们一定要发扬过去的经验，采取各种有效的措施，保障大江大河在洪水期间的安全。今年珠江、淮河和长江某些支流来水很早，水量很大。今年淮河比历次大水年早涨水二十天到一个月，上游干流洪水，在某些站超过1954年最高水位。因此，给许多地区的防汛工作造成十分紧张、十分被动的局面。各个流域的党政机关和水利部门，一定要利用目前这宝贵的时机，采取一切可能的措施，加紧修建未完的工程，改善和加固质量不好的工程，同时加强其他方面的防汛工作，准备战胜洪水的突然袭击。
    北方井灌地区，麦收以后秋收以前，有断断续续的间隙时间可用来改善水井质量。对出水量不足的半成井，要首先加以修整改善。下泉，打横管，加深井筒等，都是增加出水量的有效办法，各地可以根据具体情况加以采用。目前国家生产的水车和抽水机还不能满足需要。为了克服缺少提水工具的困难，辽宁、河北、河南、甘肃、山东等省都召开了有农民、铁匠、木匠和技术干部参加的会议，研究和改进群众新创造的或旧有的提水工具，组织当地手工业和供销部门生产和推销。为了切实发挥水井的效益，必须及时平整土地，建立田间灌溉系统，以便节省水量，扩大浇灌的效益。这一工作需要的工作量很大，有的地方不是一两年能完成的。各地可以根据地形难易，结合耕作的需要，由粗到细逐步进行。
    在南方塘坝灌溉地区，要特别注意检查水库、山塘的土坝的质量；要很好地计算上游集雨面积和溢洪道的大小，要检查放水涵管、启闭设备、溢洪道和涵管下游防冲设备是否坚固；凡是不合规格的，都要立即加以补修。有的地区把检查、评比和验收工作结合起来，联合几个工程的有关人员进行检查、评比或示范性的验收，宣传工程质量标准，加强群众性的监督，都是可以推广的方法。为了避免洪水冲毁水库、山塘造成重大灾害，必须制定蓄水和放水的管理制度，指定专人负责管理，注意解决防洪和灌溉蓄水之间的矛盾。
    谁都懂得，争取今年农业生产的丰收，对于发展我国的国民经济，对于巩固现有的农业合作社有多么巨大的意义。大家同样懂得，做好水利工作，防止旱涝灾害，正是保证今年农产丰收的重要关键。为了发展水利，我们已经投下了巨大的劳力和资金，已经获得了初步的成绩。各级党政领导机关，必须在这一基础上，再加一把劲，领导群众检查和改善工程质量，及时解决有关的问题，让新修的水利工程全部都能发挥作用。
