Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th - The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has requested the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take the necessary measures to enable the consultations between the governments of North and South Vietnam to take place, so as to discuss all issues related to consolidating peace and achieving unification on the basis of the Geneva Accords and the proposals of the two chairmen.

This request was made in a letter from Pham Van Dong, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference on June 4th. This letter has been released today.

The letter announces that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to hold consultation meetings on a date chosen by the South Vietnamese regime within the first half of June this year. The letter also states that if the South Vietnamese regime continues to refuse consultations and general elections, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests the two chairmen to reconvene the Geneva Conference to discuss the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam.

In his letter responding to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Pham Van Dong stated that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam welcomes the suggestions made by the two chairmen in their letter of May 8th to the governments of North and South Vietnam. Pham Van Dong said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam agrees with the two chairmen's views on the responsibilities of the governments of North and South Vietnam in continuing to implement the Geneva Accords. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently believed that the South Vietnamese regime is bound by the Geneva Accords, both legally and practically, and in its work. The South Vietnamese regime has the responsibility to work with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to consolidate peace and achieve the unification of Vietnam on the basis of the various provisions of the Geneva Accords. Only with the unification of Vietnam can peace be consolidated and lasting.

Pham Van Dong explained that, in accordance with the suggestions of the two chairmen, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has already written to the South Vietnamese regime on May 11th, suggesting a consultation meeting to discuss the issue of holding free general elections throughout the country. However, until now, the South Vietnamese regime has not responded to this letter.

Pham Van Dong emphasized that the Geneva Accords have clearly stipulated the time for holding free general elections for the unification of Vietnam. Now, all the Vietnamese people demand that the South Vietnamese regime must correctly implement the suggestions of the two chairmen and hold consultation meetings with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to discuss the issue of holding free general elections to unify Vietnam.

In the letter, Pham Van Dong also stated that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam agrees with the view of the two chairmen that, in order to maintain the ceasefire and consolidate peace, the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission and the Joint Ceasefire Commissions must be guaranteed and continue their normal activities on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

    范文同总理致函日内瓦会议两位主席   
    要求采取必要措施使越南南北双方举行协商
    国际委员会和联合停战委员会应继续活动
    新华社河内8日电　越南民主共和国政府已经要求日内瓦会议两位主席采取必要的措施来使越南南北双方政府的协商得以实现，以便在日内瓦协定和两位主席建议的基础上讨论同巩固和平、实现统一有关的一切问题。
    这个要求是在越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同六月四日给日内瓦会议两位主席的信中提出的。这封信已经在今天公布。
    信中宣布，越南民主共和国政府方面愿意在由南越政权在今年六月上半月内所选择的日期中举行协商会议。信中还说，如果南越政权继续采取拒绝协商和普选的态度，越南民主共和国政府要求两位主席重新召开日内瓦会议，来讨论在越南执行日内瓦协定的问题。
    范文同在这封答复日内瓦会议两位主席的信中表示，越南民主共和国政府欢迎两位主席五月八日在给越南南北双方政府的信件中所提出的建议。范文同说，越南民主共和国政府同意两位主席关于越南南北双方政府在继续执行日内瓦协定上的责任的意见。越南民主共和国政府一贯认为，在法理上和实际上及其所进行的工作上，南越政权都受日内瓦协定的约束，南越政权有责任同越南民主共和国政府一起在日内瓦协定各项条款的基础上巩固和平并且实现越南的统一。越南得到统一，和平才能够巩固和持久。
    范文同说明，根据两位主席的建议，越南民主共和国政府在五月十一日已经写信给南越政权，建议召开协商会议，讨论在全国范围内举行自由普选的问题。但是，直到现在，南越政权对这封信仍然未作答复。
    范文同强调说，日内瓦协定已经明确地规定了为统一越南而举行的自由普选的时间。现在，全体越南人民要求南越政权必须正确执行两位主席的建议，同越南民主共和国政府举行协商会议，讨论举行自由普选以统一越南的问题。
    范文同在信中还表示，越南民主共和国政府同意两位主席这样的看法：为了维持停战状态和巩固和平，国际监督和监察委员会和各联合停战委员会必须在日内瓦协定的基础上得到保障和继续进行正常活动。
