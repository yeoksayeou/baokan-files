    Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: The flood peak of the main stream of the Huai River passed Zhengyangguan on June 15th. Downstream from Zhengyangguan, the flood, controlled by the river channel, dikes, and the Sanhe Sluice, and with the large water storage capacity of Hongze Lake, can be smoothly stored and discharged.
    The flood season in the Huai River basin came a month earlier this year compared to previous years. From 08:00 on June 2nd to 08:00 on June 12th, the total rainfall in the Huai River basin reached 23 billion cubic meters, causing continuous surges in the main stream and tributaries of the Huai River. The runoff from this heavy rainfall was so large that the non-guaranteed dikes in Huaibin County, Henan Province, in the upper reaches of the Huai River, where reservoir projects were not yet fully completed, overflowed and breached on June 8th due to the flood exceeding the dike top, causing flooding disasters in some low-lying villages. At the same time, due to excessive rainfall, some low-lying areas in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces experienced varying degrees of waterlogging.
    The Huai River reservoirs and flood storage projects played a role in intercepting and storing floodwater this time. For example, the five reservoirs of Shimantan, Banqiao, Boshan, Baisha, and Nanwan collectively stored 539 million cubic meters of floodwater by the 11th of this month. The dikes and flood discharge projects on the main streams and tributaries also played their due roles. Some dikes in the flood diversion areas resisted floods exceeding the flood diversion levels. Without the functioning of these projects, this flood would have caused a serious disaster.
    Currently, the weather in the Huai River basin is clearing, and various localities will seize the time to inspect and repair dikes and culverts to prepare for future floods. According to the Central Flood Control Headquarters, there is a high possibility that the flood season will arrive earlier this year in various regions, and the rainfall in North China is higher than in the same period in the past. If preparations are not made, it will cause significant passivity and losses.

### 淮河洪峰已过正阳关

    淮河洪峰已过正阳关
    据新华社16日讯　淮河干流的洪峰六月十五日已经过了正阳关。正阳关以下，洪水在河道、堤防和三河闸的控制下，再加上洪泽湖的蓄水量大，将可以顺利蓄泄。
    淮河流域今年汛期比较往年早来了一个月。从六月二日八时到六月十二日八时，淮河流域降雨总量达二百三十亿公方，引起了淮河干流和各支流连续暴涨。加上这次暴雨所产生的径流很大，致使水库工程还未全部兴建的河南省淮河上游淮滨县非确保堤段在六月八日因洪水超过堤顶漫溢决口，局部低洼村庄被淹成灾。同时因雨量过大，河南、安徽、江苏三省部分洼地都有程度不同的渍涝灾害。
    淮河各水库和蓄洪工程这次都起了拦蓄洪水的作用。如石漫滩、板桥、薄山、白沙、南湾五个水库到本月十一日共拦蓄了洪水五亿三千九百万公方。干支流的堤防和行洪工程也发挥了应有的作用。有些分洪区的堤防这次都抗御了超过分洪水位的洪水。若没有这些工程发挥作用，这次洪水将造成严重的灾害。
    目前，淮河流域天气放晴，各地将抓紧时间对堤防涵洞进行检查修整，准备迎接今后的洪水。据中央防汛总指挥部说，今年各地汛期提前到来的可能性很大，华北雨量今年比较以往同期较多，如果不做准备，就会造成大的被动和损失。
