Visiting the "Qihong" Tea Production Area
Li Houde

	Inviting Scenery
	Qimen County during the tea-picking season is exceptionally inviting. In the lush, overlapping mountains, countless tea trees are covered in plump greenery, and beautiful flowers bloom everywhere on the mountainside. Tea-picking girls pick tea on the tea mountains while humming love songs and little tunes. Their singing and laughter emanate from the tea bushes, reverberate in the valleys, and drift into the distance. Spring birds chirp in harmony, and the music composed of countless tones seems to be singing the praises of the tea area's wondrous nature.
	
	Tea-Picking Girls
	In the early morning, when a thin mist shrouds the mountain village and the east is faintly red, the female tea-picking members, wearing straw hats and carrying tea baskets around their waists, walk in teams over small bridges and through the winding paths of the fields to pick tea on the tea mountains. How skilled and deft their tea-picking movements are! Last year, the women were unaccustomed to the methods of “picking the large and leaving the small, picking in batches, and leaving the fish leaves to pick.” This year, they have all easily mastered them. Because they understand that picking the large leaves and leaving the small leaves to grow into one bud and two or three leaves before picking not only increases production and ensures the quality of the tea produced but also allows the tea trees to grow more summer tea. They no longer use the “shaved head” method of picking tea, where everything, large and small, was picked together. In order to ensure increased tea production and improved quality, each cooperative has divided the tea mountains into sections and grouped them (teams) for contract picking, based on the distance to the tea mountains and the quality of the tea trees. The standard work points for tea picking in each cooperative at each stage include not only the quantity of fresh leaves but also the quality of the fresh leaves. The blackboard in the cooperative frequently praises those who pick tea well and criticizes those who do poorly.
	
	In the evening, when wisps of smoke curl around the old rooftops and halfway up the mountainsides, the tea-picking women carry baskets full of tea on their backs and in their hands, joyfully treading the mountain paths home. Children are already waiting for their mothers and older sisters at the bridgeheads and intersections, hoping they will bring them many flowers, raspberries, and other wild fruits.
	
	Busy Tea Making
	During the peak tea season, hundreds of thousands of catties of fresh, tender leaves are picked from the tea mountains throughout the county every day. These fresh, tender leaves must be processed by thousands of tea farmers using specialized techniques and promptly made into dried crude tea. Since liberation, due to the continuous improvement of tea-making technology, the quality of "Qihong" tea has significantly improved. This spring, after the entire county achieved cooperativization, the tea-making technology has greatly improved.
	
	In the tea area, the sound of tea-rolling machines rumbling can be heard everywhere. Tea-rolling machines help tea farmers overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor during the tea season for hundreds of years, reduce their physical labor, and effectively improve the quality of the tea. This spring, after achieving cooperativization, within a short two or three months before the spring tea season, the entire county installed 499 tea-rolling machines of various types. Together with those promoted in the past few years, there are a total of 1,136 tea-rolling machines. Every cooperative now has tea-rolling machines, and 85% of the tea can be kneaded by machine instead of by hand, rolling an additional 132,110 catties of fresh leaves every day. Tea farmers say: In the past, after a season of tea making, hands were swollen, feet were rough, blisters formed and skin peeled; now, using machines to roll tea is much easier, just shaking and sweeping. Moreover, there is less tea dust and the quality is better.
	
	This year, each cooperative has a drying room. At night, kerosene lamps and gas lamps are lit in the drying rooms, and members come to the drying rooms like entering a factory, taking turns in shifts to dry the tea. Experienced older members patiently pass on the technology to the younger members. Drying tea is a delicate task. To dry the wet semi-finished tea into dried crude tea, it must go through three dryings and three spreads (airings), relying on the experienced hands of the tea farmers, who must repeatedly shake and toss it more than a dozen times to evenly dry the tea.
	
	Tea-Selling Workers
	In previous years, the entrances of tea purchasing stations were crowded with people. One load after another, one bag after another of tea were lined up in a long queue. Tea farmers held number plates, waiting to sell tea, arguing and shouting, pushing and shoving. This was because the tea they brought to sell was only 70% dry crude tea. If it was not promptly sold to the station for baking, the tea would deteriorate. They also wanted to sell the tea early so they could go back and pick more fresh leaves, lest the leaves get old on the tea trees. After cooperativization, tea sales are concentrated. The purchasing station stipulates which cooperatives sell on odd days and which cooperatives sell on even days. Because the cooperatives produce fully dried crude tea, it will not deteriorate even if the sale is delayed for a few days. In this way, there are no longer crowds of people selling tea at the purchasing stations. On May 1st, Labor Day, we encountered more than thirty loads of tea being carried to the purchasing station in the Likou tea area. Upon inquiring, we learned that it was from the Huanglongkou Tea Production Cooperative. The young men carrying the tea followed each other closely. Because it had rained, the grass on both sides of the mountain road and the edges of the fields was covered with dewdrops. If they carried the loads horizontally as they used to, the tea bags would get wet, and the dried tea would become damp again. If thousands of loads of tea were mixed together at the station, "one rat dropping would ruin a pot of porridge." Therefore, the tea carriers would rather put in a little more effort and carry the tea straight on their shoulders than let the tea get damp. This little thing shows how much the members care about the collective interests of the entire cooperative. Wang Youhui, a member of the Huanglongkou Tea Production Cooperative, told me: "The cooperative is so good. Our entire cooperative has more than one hundred and fifty households. Today, we are selling more than two thousand catties of tea, but only thirty-one people are carrying it. After carrying it to the station, we only need to leave one person to sell the tea. If we hadn't formed a cooperative, every household would have had to send someone to sell the tea, how much more labor would that have wasted!"
	
	Tea Appraisers
	"Appraise tea according to samples, price based on quality, good tea gets a good price, inferior tea gets an inferior price." This is the working guideline for tea appraisers in Qimen's tea purchasing stations. Tea appraisers are generally experienced old tea farmers with high tea appraisal skills, selected and dispatched by the government to take on this job, and they feel honored. How to appraise tea reasonably is a delicate and complex task. Every day, the purchasing stations receive tens of millions of catties of tea. The tea appraisers determine the quality of the tea by looking at the tea samples, grasping the dryness, observing the oldness and tenderness of the lines, and smelling the aroma. Some tea appraisers are so skilled in their tea appraisal techniques that after the tea is brewed, they can tell whether it is river tea or mountain tea, Yangshan tea or Yinshan tea. The tea farmers admire the appraisers' skills from the bottom of their hearts. Tea appraisers must not only have high skills but also a high sense of responsibility and a fair service attitude. Through their work, tea farmers will understand "what kind of tea, what kind of price" and experience that the state's tea price policy is truly reasonable. The tea appraisers also deeply feel the benefits of cooperativization. They say that now it is easier to accurately assess the tea from dozens or hundreds of cooperatives; in the past, they had to assess the tea from thousands of households, and even with iron eyes, they could not avoid missing some tea, so it was no wonder that the tea farmers had some opinions.
	
	Gifts of Peace and Friendship
	Tea occupies an important position in people's lives. After a meal and drinks, brewing a cup of tea adds to the enjoyment of life. When guests arrive, offering them a cup of hot, fragrant tea naturally increases the friendly feelings between each other. The famous Turkish poet Hikmet once said: "I discovered the fragrant spring in Chinese tea." In the Soviet Union, Chinese "Qihong" tea also has a large number of enthusiasts, and some collective farms in the Soviet Union have already planted "Qihong" tea trees.
	
	On May 8th, the first batch of "Qihong" refined tea was shipped from Qimen to Shanghai. This famous tea will be sent abroad to participate in exhibitions. It will be welcomed by more people in the international market, spreading the fragrance of peace and friendship.

    访问“祁红”茶产区
    李厚德
          诱人的景色
    采茶期的祁门县，景色分外诱人。蓊郁重叠的山峦里，数不清的茶树披上了丰满的绿装，山腰里到处开放着美丽的花朵。采茶的姑娘们在茶山上一面采茶，一面哼着情歌小调，歌声笑语从茶丛蓬中传出来，回旋在山谷里，又飘荡到远方。春鸟和鸣，无数种音调配成的乐曲，好像在歌颂着茶区的美妙的大自然。
            采茶女
    清晨，当薄雾笼罩着山村、东方微微发红的时候，采茶的女社员们，头戴草帽，腰系茶篮，一队一队地走过小桥，穿过田塍曲道到茶山上去采茶了。她们采茶的动作多么熟练、轻巧啊！去年妇女们不习惯的
  “采大留小、分批采、留鱼叶采”的方法，今年都很容易地做到了。因为她们懂得了采大叶留小叶长到一芽二、三叶再采，不但可以增加产量，保证制出的茶叶质量好，而且可以使茶树长出更多的夏茶。她们再也不用过去大小一齐采的“剃光头”的方法采茶了。各个社里为了保证增加茶叶产量和提高质量，都根据茶山远近、茶树好坏，划片分组（队）包采。各个社订出的各个阶段的采摘茶叶的标准工分，不仅包括生叶数量，还要看生叶质量。在合作社的黑板上经常表扬那些采茶采得好的人，批评那些做得不好的人。
    傍晚，袅袅的炊烟回绕在老屋顶、半山腰的时候，采茶的妇女背着、携着满篮的茶叶，喜悦地踏着山路归来。孩子们很早就在桥头、路口迎接妈妈、姐姐，盼望她们给他带来很多鲜花、莓子和其它野果。
              制茶忙
    在茶汛盛期，全县茶山上每天要采下几十万斤鲜嫩的生叶。这些鲜嫩的生叶要经过成千上万个茶农的手，用专门的技术加工，及时制成足干毛茶。解放后，由于制茶技术的不断改进，“祁红”茶叶的品质已经有了显著提高。今春全县实现了合作化以后，制茶的技术又有了很大的改进。
    在茶区里，到处可以听见揉茶机辘辘地揉茶的声音。揉茶机帮助茶农克服了几百年来茶季劳动力不足的困难，减轻了他们的体力劳动，有效地提高了茶叶质量。今春实现合作化后，在春茶前短短的二、三个月内全县就安装了各式揉茶机499部，连同过去几年推广的，共有揉茶机1，136部，社社都有了揉茶机，85％的茶叶可以用机器代替人工揉捻了，每天可以多揉生叶132，110斤。茶农们说：过去一季茶做下来，手肿脚粗，长了泡又脱皮，脱了皮又长泡；如今用机器揉茶，摇摇，扫扫，轻松得多了。而且茶叶末少，质量也好。
    今年各个社都设有烘房。入夜，烘房里点起了煤油灯、汽灯，社员们像进工厂一样来到烘房里，轮流换班烘茶。烘茶技术熟练的老社员耐心地把技术传授给年轻的社员。烘茶的工作是细致的，如由湿胚烘成足干毛茶，要经过三烘三摊（晾），凭着茶农的一双有经验的手，一次又一次要翻抖十多次，才能把茶叶均匀烘干。
            卖茶工
      往年茶叶收购站门口人山人海，一担又一担，一袋又一袋的茶叶排成一条长龙，茶农们拿着号头牌，等待去售茶，你吵我叫，你挤我拥。这是因为他们拿来卖的茶都是七成干的毛茶，不及时卖给站里进行烘焙，茶叶就会变质。他们还想早点把茶叶卖掉，回去多采一些生叶，免得叶子老在茶树上。合作化以后，卖茶集中了。收购站规定了那些社逢单日卖，那些社逢双日卖；因为社里制的都是足干毛茶，就是耽搁几天卖也不会变质。这样，采购站里卖茶的人不再拥挤了。“五一”劳动节那天，我们在历口茶区碰见了三十多担茶叶挑往采购站去售茶，一打听，知道是黄龙口茶叶生产合作社的。挑茶的青年小伙子，一个紧跟着一个。因为在雨后，山路和田埂两旁的草都沾满了水珠，如果还和往日一样，横着担子挑，就会把茶袋沾湿，干茶就要回潮，卖给站里千百担茶混合在一起，“一粒老鼠屎，坏了一锅粥”。所以，挑茶的人宁肯自己多费一点劲，直着担子挑茶，也不能让茶叶受潮湿。从这件小事上可以看出社员们是多么关心全社的集体利益。黄龙口茶叶生产合作社社员汪有辉告诉我说：“合作社多好啊，我们全社一百五十多户，今天卖茶有二千多斤，只有三十一个人挑，挑到站后，留一人卖茶就行啦。如果没办社，就得户户都有人去卖茶，要多费多少劳动力呀。”评茶员
      “对样评茶，按质论价，好茶好价，次茶次价”。这是祁门各个茶叶收购站里评茶员的工作指南。评茶员一般都是有很高的评茶技术的老茶农，受政府挑选派遣来担任这一工作，他们感到光荣。如何把茶评得合理，是一件细致而复杂的工作。每天收购站里收进千万斤茶，就凭评茶员们对着茶样，手抓干度，眼看线条老嫩，鼻闻香味，来评定茶叶的好坏。有的评茶员的评茶技术是这样地高明，茶叶开汤（泡）后，他可以看出是洲茶还是山茶，是阳山茶还是阴山茶。茶农们从心底佩服评茶员们的技术。评茶员不但要有很高的技术，而且要有高度的责任心和公正的服务态度，通过他们的工作，会使茶农们懂得“什么样的茶，什么样的价”，体验到国家的茶价政策真正是合理的。评茶员们也深深地感到合作化的好处，他们说，现在看几十上百个社的茶，容易看得准；过去要看千家万户的茶，就是铁眼睛，也免不了有的茶看走眼，当然也难怪茶农们有些意见。和平友谊礼物
    茶，在人民生活中占据着重要的地位。在饭过酒后，泡上一杯茶，增添了生活的乐趣。客人来了，首先敬他一杯滚热的香茶，就很自然地增加了彼此间的友好感情。著名的土耳其诗人希克梅特曾经说过：“我在中国的香茶里发现了芬芳的春天”。在苏联，我国的“祁红”茶叶也拥有大量的嗜好者，苏联的一些集体农庄已经种植了“祁红”种茶树。
    五月八日首批“祁红”精茶已经从祁门运往上海，这批名茶将出国参加展览，它将在国际市场上受到更多的人的欢迎，散发着和平友谊的芬芳。
