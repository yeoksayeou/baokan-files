Xinhua News Agency, Fukuoka, 10th. The Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan gave its premiere performance last night in Fukuoka City, Kyushu. The audience filled the "Daihaku Theater," the largest theater in Fukuoka City, with more than 200 people watching the performance from standing room.

Applause rang out continuously throughout the performance. Kobayashi Kirii, Chairman of the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly, Takaoka Yasushi, Chairman of the Fukuoka City Council, representatives from the "Asahi Shimbun" newspaper, and representatives from the Chinese Overseas Association went on stage after the performance to present flowers to Mei Lanfang.

Konishi Haruo, the mayor of Fukuoka City, who had seen Peking Opera several times in China before, said that he never expected to see such beautiful Chinese classical art in Fukuoka today. He also said: Japan and China are close neighbors, and I hope that the two countries will restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible, and that Peking Opera can be seen at any time.

Fukuoka is famous for producing "Hakata dolls," colorful clay dolls. Kojima Yoichi, a famous veteran artist, said after watching the Peking Opera: "From Mei Lanfang's dance with a fan and Li Shaochun's posture of walking with a knife on his back, I saw a kind of true beauty that I had never seen before and that is difficult to describe. I must make their graceful and majestic posture into Hakata dolls."

Xinhua News Agency, Fukuoka, 10th. Because today is Sunday, people from all over Kyushu, Japan, are particularly enthusiastic about coming to Fukuoka to watch the performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe.

Two hours before the performance, many spectators were already queuing at the theater door waiting for it to open. Among the audience was a "Peking Opera Appreciation Group" composed of eighty fishermen from Nagasaki City, who took a train and traveled more than 160 kilometers to see the show. Thirty-five farmers from Saga hired a car to come and see the show and held a meeting in the car to specifically learn about Chinese Peking Opera knowledge. In addition, many other spectators came from nearby cities and towns such as Omuta, Shimonoseki, and Beppu.

Young overseas Chinese from Kyushu, Nagasaki, Kagoshima and other places designated today as Peking Opera Appreciation Day, inviting overseas Chinese over the age of sixty to watch the performance of artists from their motherland.

    我国京剧团在福冈市公演
    新华社福冈10日电　中国访日京剧代表团昨天晚上在九州的福冈市举行首次公演。观众挤满了福冈市最大的戏院“大博剧场”，买站票看戏的有二百多人。
    在演出中间，剧场内不断响起掌声。福冈县议会议长小林喜利、福冈市议会议长高丘稳以及“朝日新闻”社和华侨总会代表等在演出终了后纷纷走上舞台，向梅兰芳献花。
    从前曾经在中国看过好几次京剧的福冈市长小西春雄说，真想不到今天能够在福冈看到这样优美的中国古典艺术。他还说：日本和中国是近邻，我希望两国早日恢复邦交，并且随时都能看到京剧。
    福冈以出产用粘土做的彩色玩偶“博多人形”著名于世。著名老艺人小岛与一看过京剧后说：“我从梅兰芳拿着扇子舞蹈和李少春背着刀走路的姿态里，看到了从来没有看过的难以言语形容的真正的美。我一定要把他们优美和威武的姿态做成博多人形。”
    新华社福冈10日电　因为今天是星期日的缘故，日本九州各地人民到福冈观看中国京剧团演出的，显得格外踊跃。
    在开演两个钟头前，很多观众就在戏院门口排队等候开门。观众中，有长崎市八十几个渔民组成的“京剧观赏团”，他们坐火车走了一百六十多公里赶来看戏。三十五个从佐贺雇了汽车前来看戏的农民，在汽车里开了一个会，来专门学习关于中国京剧的知识。此外还有很多观众是从大牟田、下关、别府等附近的城乡赶来的。
    九州长崎、鹿儿岛等地的青年华侨把今天定为观赏京剧日，招待六十岁以上的华侨来看祖国艺术家的演出。
