Xinhua News Agency, 16th: China's ten large sugar factories planned for construction this year are currently accelerating their building. These sugar factories are all quite large in scale and are either automated or semi-automated. The largest factory can process three thousand tons of sugarcane per day, and the smallest can process over one thousand tons per day. Once these sugar factories are put into production, China's machine-made sugar production will double.

The construction of these sugar factories is part of the Chinese government's plan to improve people's lives. Several factories were not originally included in the First Five-Year Plan but are now being built ahead of schedule. Eight sugar factories using sugarcane as raw material are distributed in the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Fujian. The other two sugar factories using sugar beet as raw material are being built in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Qiqihar, respectively.

According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Food Industry, there are many benefits to building these sugar factories ahead of schedule. Although China's sugar industry has developed rapidly in recent years, with the national planned sugar production this year increasing nearly five times compared to 1949, the Chinese people's need for sugar consumption has increased even faster. Currently, domestic sugar cannot fully meet the needs of the people, so the people welcome the state building more sugar factories. On the other hand, newly built sugar factories can also accumulate funds for the country's development of heavy industry. It is estimated that after these ten newly built sugar factories are put into production, they can recover the entire investment in just about one year.

    十个大糖厂正在加速建设
    新华社16日讯　中国今年计划兴建的十个大型制糖工厂目前正在加速建设。这些糖厂的规模都相当大，而且都是自动化或半自动化的。最大的厂一天能榨制三千吨甘蔗，最小的一天也能榨制一千多吨。这些糖厂投入生产以后，中国机制糖的产量将比现在增加一倍。
    这些糖厂的兴建，是中国政府改善人民生活计划的一部分。有几个厂都是原定第一个五年计划没有列入，而现在特别提前兴建的。八个用甘蔗作原料的糖厂分布在广东、广西、四川、福建四省。另两个用甜菜作原料的糖厂分别建在内蒙古自治区和齐齐哈尔。
    据食品工业部的负责人谈，这些糖厂提前兴建的好处很多。中国大陆的制糖工业近几年虽然发展很快，今年全国计划产糖量约比1949年增加将近五倍。但是中国人民糖消费的需要却增涨更快。现在国产糖还不能完全满足人民的需要，所以人民很欢迎国家多建糖厂。另一方面，新建糖厂还可以为国家发展重工业积累资金。估计这十个新建的糖厂生产以后，只要一年左右的时间就可以收回全部投资。
