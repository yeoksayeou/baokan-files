    Empty Talk on Paper Cannot Promote Advanced Experiences
    To the Editor:
    The development work in the Linxi Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine has always used pneumatic drills to chisel rocks. Therefore, during work, a large amount of rock dust flies around, and workers are prone to "silicosis." After liberation, a coal mine created an advanced experience of wet drilling, which can prevent dust from flying. As early as 1952, Kailuan Linxi Mine decided to seriously study and vigorously promote this advanced experience; but now it has been four years, and Linxi Mine is still using pneumatic drilling.
    Why is advanced experience treated like this? The responsibility must be sought from the leadership. In the process of promoting wet drilling, the problems of unstable and insufficient water needles have not been solved by anyone. In May of last year, several workers in the development area proposed using water pipes to spray directly at the drilling point as a temporary solution before the water needle problem was solved. However, in order to save trouble, the leaders of Linxi Mine asked each development area to adopt this method, and the water needles were simply no longer manufactured. In fact, using spraying to chisel rocks does not have a great effect on reducing rock dust, especially because it is difficult to dump rock dust outward, which will affect the efficiency of the development footage, so each working face does not use it frequently.
    In July of last year, when the mine was formulating a plan to promote advanced experience, it again proposed to promote wet drilling. The plan was to first promote it in five development working faces in August, and then promote it in each roadway in September. The plan was there, but no one was responsible for the problems of water needles, drill bits, and water trucks. Therefore, none of the development working faces truly implemented wet drilling.
    In April of this year, the work plan of Linxi Mine again proposed to promote wet drilling in eight development working faces, and also said that "measured water supply" would be tried in the 7701 working face—this is the experience created by Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine. Using this method during wet drilling can eliminate the need to install water needles on the pneumatic drills. Now April is long past, not to mention the "measured water supply" not being tried, wet drilling has not been implemented.
    Some workers in the development area call the mine's plan "empty checks that cannot be cashed." The leaders of Linxi Mine should seriously consider this criticism. Stop just talking and not doing, empty talk on paper cannot promote advanced experiences.

### 纸上空谈是推广不了先进经验的

    纸上空谈是推广不了先进经验的 编辑同志：
    开滦林西矿井下的开拓工程，一直是使用风锤凿打岩石的。因此，工作的时候，大量的岩石粉飞扬，工人们很容易患“矽肺”病。解放后，有一个煤矿创造了湿式凿岩的先进经验，可以防止石粉飞扬。早在1952年，开滦林西矿就决定要认真学习和大力推行这个先进经验；但是到现在已经四年了，林西矿仍然是用风锤凿岩。
    为什么会这样地对待先进经验呢？责任不能不从领导身上去找。湿式凿岩的经验在推行过程中，水针不坚固和供应不足的问题一直无人负责解决。去年五月份，开拓区几个工人提出了风锤上不安装水针，用水管直接往凿眼处喷水的建议作为水针问题没有解决之前的临时办法。但是，林西矿的领导人员为了图省事，就要各开拓区采用这个办法，水针干脆不再制造了。实际上，用喷水办法凿打岩石，减少岩石粉飞扬的效果不大，特别是因为往外倒岩石粉有困难，会影响开拓进尺效率，所以各掌子都不经常使用。
    去年七月，这个矿在制订先进经验推行计划的时候，又提出了要推行湿式凿岩，做法是八月份先在五个开拓掌子推行，九月份再在各道巷推行。计划有了，可是水针、钎子和水车等问题还是没人负责，因此那一个开拓掌子也没有真正实行湿式凿岩。
    今年四月，林西矿的工作计划中又提出了要在八个开拓掌子推行湿式凿岩，并且说在7701掌还要试行“测式供水”——这是开滦唐家庄矿创造的经验，湿式凿岩时采用这个办法，就可以不用在风锤上安装水针。现在四月早过了，不要说“测式供水”没有试行，湿式凿岩也没有实行。
    有些开拓区的工人管矿上的计划叫“不能兑现的空头支票”。林西矿的领导人员应该好好考虑这个批评。不要光说不做了，纸上空谈是推行不了先进经验的。
