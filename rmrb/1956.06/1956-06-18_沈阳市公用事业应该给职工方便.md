Shenyang's Public Utilities Should Provide Convenience to Employees
By our reporter Jin Yukun

It is the policy of the Party and the government, and a common understanding for everyone, that urban public utilities (trams, buses, tap water, gas, etc.) should serve the broad masses of workers and the working people. Judging by this requirement, some public utilities in Shenyang are providing very poor service: prices are high and inconvenient.

Regarding the issue of high prices, taking trams as an example, Shenyang has never considered reducing the burden on workers when adjusting fares, so each adjustment has resulted in an increase. In 1950, a monthly pass cost 1.05 yuan. In 1951, it was changed to 1.40 yuan, an increase of 33%. In 1953, travel on all lines was changed to travel on specific lines, doubling the price for those using two lines. In November 1954, the monthly pass system was simply abolished altogether, on the grounds that preferential treatment for employees was the responsibility of the enterprise itself, and public utilities had no such responsibility! The abolition of monthly passes greatly increased the burden on employees who commuted long distances. In the past, taking tram line 6 (Tiexi District) cost only 1.40 yuan per month. After the abolition of monthly passes, it cost more than 3 yuan per month to buy tickets. Some employees who needed to take two lines (lines 2 and 6) had to spend more than 6 yuan per month, accounting for 12.3% of their average monthly wage (calculated at 48.6 yuan). Some workers whose lives were already difficult could not afford to take the tram after the abolition of monthly passes and had to walk to and from work. Worker Sun Fengkai lived in Dongta, more than 20 li from the factory. After the abolition of monthly passes, he had to get up at 4:00 every morning and start walking at 4:30, not arriving at the factory until 6:30. He had to spend more than four hours on the road every day, leaving him exhausted, which affected his production and after-work studies.

Due to numerous complaints from employees, the Shenyang Tram Factory reluctantly restored the monthly pass system in October 1955. However, the new monthly pass system was not convenient for people. The price was calculated at 80% of the full fare, but only a small number of people traveled the full distance. For most employees, using a monthly pass was more expensive than buying individual tickets. Naturally, very few people bought monthly passes. Therefore, the monthly pass was equivalent to not being restored at all.

Water charges are also unreasonable. The cost of each ton of water is 3.6 fen, but the selling price is 11 fen. The profit is twice the cost. The water consumption quota is even more unreasonable. Most tap water users in Shenyang do not have water meters. The water company determines the water consumption quota and charges fees based on the type of water usage. According to the water company's regulations, 2.5 tons of water are charged per person per month for those with sanitation facilities, and 2 tons of water are charged for those with only water supply and drainage but incomplete sanitation facilities. In reality, most employees do not use that much water. In Dalian, only 1.5 tons of water are charged for those with sanitation facilities, and only 1 ton of water is charged for those with only water supply and drainage (according to measurements, the actual amount can be even lower). The unreasonable water consumption quota benefits a small number of users with higher living standards or who waste a lot of water, while most employees suffer great losses. Zhang Yuhai, a driver at No. 7 Heping Street in Shenyang, has a family of seven. In the past, he had to pay 1.54 yuan per month for water according to the water company's quota. After installing a water meter in March this year, his water usage remained the same, but the water bill dropped to just over 3 jiao, and even with the toilet water usage (which uses water from another water meter), it was only about 5 jiao. In addition to overcharging, there is also the situation of double counting. Generally, employees have to pay three water bills: one at home, one at the enterprise (charging one ton of water per registered employee), and one at the cafeteria (charging 1.5 tons of water per person). Added together, that's a total of five tons of water!

Issues of inconvenience: such as trams stopping too early in the evening; in winter, trackless trams stop at 9:00 PM, and trams stop at 10:00 PM; in summer, trackless trams stop at 9:30 PM, and trams stop at 10:30 PM. If employees have meetings or cultural activities a little later in the evening, they cannot catch the tram, and there is no tram to take home after watching a play or a late-night movie. Trams stop too early, so workers on the late shift can only walk. Some factories dismiss workers at 11:00 PM. There is no place to rest in the factory, and they cannot catch the tram home, so by the time they walk home, it is already 2:00 AM the next morning. This affects workers' rest.

Most of the trams and buses in Shenyang run east-west, and there are very few north-south lines, which also causes great inconvenience to urban transportation. Also, due to historical reasons, all modern facilities in Shenyang's public utilities are mostly concentrated in a few areas, while they are scarce or even non-existent in areas where the working people live. Not many active measures have been taken in recent years. For example, in the Beiguan and Dongguan districts, where the largest number of workers live, only about 10% of the population drinks tap water, and there is no gas equipment at all.

The main reason for the high prices and inconvenience of Shenyang's public utilities, in their own words, is that they "only emphasized national financial revenue, only saw how much profit was turned over, and almost forgot the word 'service'." Because they forgot "service," the production targets issued each year are mainly financial targets (how much revenue, how much profit, how much is turned over), not service targets. Employees discuss planned financial targets, and the annual enterprise bonuses are also based on financial targets. The 511 chartered car team of the Tram Company operated safely for more than 100,000 kilometers, but did not complete the financial revenue task in the second quarter of last year, so the model car fell apart, and the model conductor was no longer a model.

In order to ensure the completion of financial tasks, all kinds of strange arguments that disregard the people's lives have emerged. Some require trams and buses to run less, travel fewer kilometers, and carry more passengers (that is, increase revenue by increasing passenger congestion), and some require increasing the average consumption of tap water and gas by users (in fact, there is a certain limit), and not increasing it is "conservative thinking." Some even resorted to despicable means of deceiving users in order to increase the average consumption of users, such as moving the water meter needles (to increase water charges) and lowering the gas heat (which can increase consumption), etc. (which has now been corrected).

The result of this approach is often the opposite. For example, due to the high tram fares and the abolition of monthly passes, the number of employees taking the tram has greatly decreased. Since 1954, the total number of passengers has been declining year by year, and revenue has also decreased accordingly. The existing public transport equipment cannot be fully utilized.

The price of public utilities is determined by profit and turnover, and profit and turnover are determined by the financial department. The financial department lacks a clear policy on the financial tasks of public utilities and has unilaterally emphasized increasing financial revenue for many years, while neglecting the difference between public utilities and other enterprises. Therefore, the financial tasks assigned to public utility enterprises are often too heavy and increase greatly every year. According to the Shenyang Public Utility Bureau, the task in 1956 increased by one and a half times compared to 1951. According to comrades from the Public Utility Bureau, in order to complete this task, they have to maintain the current alarmingly high profit. For example, the profit rate of the water plant must reach 202% (17% higher than last year), and the overall profit rate of the Public Utility Bureau must reach 44% (12% higher than last year). In addition to profit, there are also taxes. For example, in addition to a 2% business tax, trams also have a local surtax of up to 21%. Therefore, the Public Utility Bureau does have its own difficulties in terms of price issues. They said: We are willing to lower prices and are also willing to reduce the burden on employees, but the financial tasks are fixed and do not allow us to do so! In fact, this is the case. The Public Utility Bureau has indeed proposed price reductions several times, but the financial department, fearing that it would affect "national revenue," has never agreed, resulting in the price issue not being resolved for a long time.

Urban public utilities are social welfare undertakings, and they are related to the lives of the masses every day. If they are not run well, the impact will be great. Therefore, they must be run well, and they must be run both cheaply and conveniently. The relevant leading authorities should quickly take measures to make reasonable adjustments, and the financial department should also consider appropriately reducing the financial tasks of public utilities. Public utility units should also strengthen their mass perspective and earnestly improve the service work of public utilities.

    沈阳市公用事业应该给职工方便
    本报记者　金雨困
    城市公用事业（电车、汽车、自来水、瓦斯等）应该为广大职工和劳动人民服务，这是党和政府的方针，也是人人都懂得的常识。用这个要求来看沈阳市有些公用事业，可以说服务得很不好：价格贵，不方便。
    贵的问题，以电车为例，沈阳市历次调整票价的时候，没有考虑减轻职工的负担，因此调整一次就上涨一次。1950年每张月票是一元零五分。1951年改为一元四角，上涨33％。1953年又变各线通行为专线通行，乘两线者涨一倍。1954年11月就索性根本取消了月票制度，理由是：优待职工是企业自己的事情，公用事业没有这个责任！月票的取消，给长期乘车上下班的职工增加了很大负担。过去乘六线（铁西区）电车，每月只需一元四角，取消月票后每月买票就需三元多。有的职工需坐两线（二线和六线）的，每月要花六元多，就占月平均工资（以48.6元计算）的12.3％。有的生活本来困难的工人，取消月票后，坐不起电车，只好步行上下班。工人孙凤凯家住东塔，离工厂有二十多里，取消月票后每天早晨四点钟起床，四点半开始步行，六点半才到厂，每天要在路上来回四个多小时，弄得精疲力尽，影响了生产和业余学习。
    由于职工意见很多，沈阳市电车厂在1955年10月才勉强恢复了月票制度。但是新的月票制度并不给人方便，价格是按全程打八折计算的，而乘全程的人只是少数，大部职工用月票比买零票还贵。买月票的人数当然极少。因此月票仍然等于没有恢复。
    水费也不合理。每吨水的成本是三分六厘，售价却是一角一分。利润为成本的两倍。用水的定额更不合理。沈阳市自来水用户大部分不装水表，而由水厂分别用水种类确定用水定额收费的，根据水厂的规定，有卫生设备的每人每月收2.5吨水费，单有上下水道，卫生设备不全的收二吨水费。实际上大部职工都用不了这么多的水。旅大市有卫生设备的仅收1.5吨水费，单有上下水道的仅收一吨水费（据测定，实际还可低于此数）。不合理的用水定额，就使少数生活水平较高，或用水浪费很大的用户占了便宜，多数职工吃大亏。沈阳和平街七号汽车司机张玉海家有七口人，过去按水厂定额计费，每月要付水费一元五角四分，今年三月份安装水表后，用水情况依旧，水费却降到三角多，加上厕所用水（厕所是用另一个水表的水的）也不过五角左右。水费除了多收外，还有重复计算的情况。一般职工都要重交三份水费：一份在家，一份在企业（按在册人员每人交一吨水费），一份在食堂（每人交1.5吨水费）。加起来一共就是五吨水费！
    不够方便的问题。如晚间电车收车太早；冬季无轨电车是九时收车，有轨电车是十时收车；夏季无轨电车是九时半收车，有轨电车是十时半收车。职工晚间开会或文化学习活动稍晚一点，就乘不上电车，看戏，看晚场电影回来也没有电车。电车收得太早，上晚班的工人就只能步行。有的厂晚上十一点下班，留厂没有休息的地方，回去又坐不到电车，走回去到家就是第二天早晨两点来钟了。这就影响了工人的休息。
    沈阳市的电车、汽车大部是东西行的，南北行的线路很少，这也造成了城市交通上的极大不便。还有由于历史原因，沈阳市公用事业中一切现代化设施大部集中在少数地区，而在劳动人民集居地区则很少，甚至没有。这几年来所采取的积极措施不多。如工人集居最多的北关和东关两区，至今饮用自来水的人数只占10％左右，瓦斯设备完全没有。
    沈阳市公用事业的价格高，不方便，主要原因，用他们自己话，是“只强调了国家财政收入，看到的只是上缴利润多少，而几乎忘记了‘服务’两个字”。由于忘掉了“服务”，每年下达的生产指标，主要是财务指标（收入多少，利润多少，上缴多少）而不是服务指标，职工讨论的也是计划财务指标，每年颁发企业奖金的根据也是财务指标。电车公司511包车小组，安全运转了十万多公里，去年第二季度没有完成财务收入任务，模范车就垮了台，模范售票员也就不模范了。
    为了保证财政任务的完成，各种不顾人民生活的怪论也就出来了。有的要求电车汽车要少出车，少跑公里，多拉乘客，（即以增加乘客的拥挤来增加收入），有的要求增加用户自来水和煤气的平均用量（实际是有一定限度的），不增加就是“保守思想”。有的为了增加用户平均用量，甚至采取了欺骗用户的恶劣手段，如拨水表针（增加水费），降低瓦斯热量（可增加用量）等等（现在已经纠正）。
    这种做法的结果也往往适得其反。例如电车由于票价较贵又取消了月票，职工乘车人数就大大减少，自1954年以来乘车的总人次是逐年下降的，收入也相应地下降了。现有的公共交通设备不能充分发挥作用。
    公用事业的价格决定于利润和上缴，利润和上缴又决定于财政部门。财政部门对公用事业的财政任务缺乏明确的方针，历年来只片面强调了增加财政收入，而忽略了公用事业不同于其它企业的地方。因此，给公用事业企业的财政任务往往过重，而且年年要增加很多，据沈阳市公用局计算，1956年较1951年增加了一倍半。据公用局同志谈，要完成这个任务，就不能不维持目前高得吓人的利润。如水厂利润率就必须达到202％（较去年还高17％），公用局总的利润率也必须达到44％（比去年提高12％）。除了利润还有税。如电车除了2％的营业税外，还有高达21％的地方附加税。因此在价格问题上，公用局也确实有它的苦衷。他们说：我们愿意降低价格，也愿意减轻职工负担，可是财政任务卡得死死的，不让你这样干！事实上也是这样，公用局也确实曾经数次提出降价问题，但是财政部门怕影响“国家收入”，始终没有同意，致使价格问题长期不得解决。
    城市公用事业是社会福利性事业，它同群众的生活天天要发生关系，办不好影响就很大。因此必须办好，而且要办得既便宜又方便。有关领导机关应该迅速采取措施合理调整，财政部门也应该考虑适当减轻公用事业的财政任务。公用事业单位也应该加强群众观念，切切实实地改善公用事业的服务工作。
