    Emphasizing Teacher Training and the Work of People's Teachers
    ——Speech by Representative Chen Yuan
    Allow me to say a few words on the issue of higher teacher training education.
    This year, both middle school and university enrollment have encountered a new situation, which is that the planned enrollment quota exceeds the number of graduating students applying for admission. The number of high school graduates is less than the planned enrollment quota for universities; the number of junior high school graduates is less than the planned enrollment quota for high schools and secondary vocational schools. This means that there is a supply shortage between junior high and high school, and between high school and universities. This situation illustrates that our socialist construction is advancing rapidly by leaps and bounds, and the demand for senior and mid-level specialized talent has greatly increased; but it also shows that our secondary education is far from meeting the needs and must be greatly developed, otherwise it will cause great difficulties for national economic construction.
    If we want to establish more middle schools, the main difficulty is the lack of teachers, as Minister of Education Zhang Xiruo pointed out in his speech at the conference: "The problem of insufficient teachers in primary and secondary schools is becoming increasingly serious." "It is estimated that in 1956 and 1957, there will be a shortage of about 90,000 middle school teachers and about 200,000 primary school teachers." This is such a large number. I believe that the government's measures to expand higher normal school enrollment, develop short-term normal classes, and tap potential human resources are all extremely important. I personally express my strong agreement and support.
    However, I think there is another issue that deserves attention from all parties, which is how to further strengthen society's emphasis on and respect for the work of people's teachers, in order to more effectively guarantee the source of normal school students, and to strengthen teachers' love for and sense of responsibility for their work.
    In recent years, thousands of young people, recognizing the importance of the people's education cause, have entered normal schools based on their own conditions. Many young people have already taken on the sacred duty of teachers, and are working hard on the education front to cultivate the next generation for the motherland. This is the main aspect. But on the other hand, there are still some young people who look down on normal schools, believing that studying at a normal school is not honorable, has no future, has low pay, and cannot engage in scientific research. Therefore, even if their own conditions are suitable for studying at a normal school, they have concerns and hesitate. A few days ago, the editor's note in the "Teacher's Newspaper" stated that some young people "emphasize science and engineering and belittle liberal arts, especially the work of people's teachers." Since the phrase "especially" is added, this issue cannot but arouse attention.
    The main reasons for this phenomenon, I think, are the following:
    1. The influence of old social thinking: Because the ruling class in the old society was fundamentally unwilling for the people to receive education and did not value education, they naturally did not value teachers. Teachers were always looked down upon in the old society, with low social status, low wages, and even unable to support their families. Therefore, some people only regarded the teaching profession as a "temporary shelter." As long as there were other options, they would not want to be teachers again, which is very natural. The long-term influence of the old society cannot be completely eliminated in a short time, and still exists quite widely in the ideological consciousness of some people, often intentionally or unintentionally affecting young people and hindering their correct view of people's teachers in the new society.
    2. Our frequent propaganda and education are insufficient: Young people are still young after all, and sometimes they may see problems one-sidedly. Administrative organs, schools, and the Youth League need to help them correctly understand the role of various professions in national construction, and help and guide them to choose their aspirations in a realistic manner, so that they recognize that the facilities of various professions are important, and do not inappropriately emphasize that a certain profession is important or that a certain profession is not important. For example, the work of teachers is originally very important, but some students think that it is not as grand and vigorous as industrial construction, and they cannot see the role of teachers in construction. If it is repairing a reservoir or building a large bridge, one can see that the work they participated in has played a huge role and benefited the people after a few years. However, the work of teachers is "cultivating people for a hundred years." It takes 16 or 17 years from elementary school to university graduation, and even longer if you include kindergarten. This kind of labor cannot see results immediately. In fact, the work of teachers is the work of cultivating people. The achievements of his work are infused into every construction work that benefits the people, and are reaped by every school graduate. For such basic construction work, frequent publicity should be done among young people to form a new public opinion in the society, so that young people and other people have a correct understanding. If we only rely on temporary guidance during enrollment each year, the results will not be great.
    3. The impression that teachers directly give to young people: Students have the most opportunities to contact teachers, and the influence that teachers give to students is also the greatest. This should be viewed from two aspects: On the one hand, if students see that their teachers' work is always busy and chaotic, their living conditions are not good, and even in some areas teachers cannot get the respect they deserve, then when young people choose their own aspirations, it will be difficult to choose to study at a normal school. On the other hand, some teachers do not study their profession, do not pay attention to the cultivation of moral character, and even have not established a professional ideology and are not at ease with their work. Such teachers, in the process of "subtle influence," give students a very bad impression, making them feel that the work of teachers is meaningless.
    Based on these situations, we should take effective and concrete measures to further emphasize teacher training and the work of people's teachers, and appropriately raise the status and treatment of people's teachers to the level they deserve. I think we can refer to the words of the great teacher Lenin in his "Diary Excerpts." He said, "The status of our national teachers should be elevated to a height that teachers in bourgeois society can never reach. This is an undeniable truth. For this, we must carry out systematic and unwavering work, both to improve the spiritual state of teachers and to enable them to have all-round cultivation, in order to truly meet their noble title, and the most important thing is to improve their material living conditions." In the future, we should not only strengthen regular ideological propaganda and education, but also pay attention to some practical issues, such as teachers' political treatment, social status, living conditions, wages, etc. Doing so can not only gradually eliminate the influence left over from the old society, but also greatly encourage people's teachers spiritually and materially. Of course, our Party and government have always attached importance to and cared for the work of people's teachers, but some aspects are still not done well enough; some areas have not yet implemented them well.
    In terms of ideological education, I think it is necessary for leading comrades at all levels from the central government to the local governments to make more and more specific calls and instructions to promote a correct view of people's teachers in society. Kalinin, one of the main leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, did he not leave us with many guiding articles and reports on education and teachers? Have our leading comrades at all levels paid enough attention to this issue? In addition, I think our "China Youth," "China Youth Daily," "Teacher's Newspaper," and other newspapers and magazines also have a responsibility to do more work in this area. At least, there should never be such a statement as in an article in the "China Youth Daily" on April 30 this year. This article was answering a question from a middle school student who was about to graduate and wanted to apply to the university's physics department, asking for guidance. He "guided" that student by saying:
   "If your foundation in physics and chemistry is not very good, then it is a good thing for you to apply to a normal school." Such "guidance" is tantamount to telling young people: If you have a good foundation, don't apply to a normal school. Wouldn't it be a pity to apply to a normal school with a good foundation in physics and chemistry? In fact, can the physics department of a normal school have a poor foundation in physics and chemistry? In addition, there is another example. A student who passed the entrance examination to a higher normal school wrote a letter to report to his parents. The parents said: "Why did you apply to a normal school with such good grades?" The implication is full of infinite regret. There are still many such examples, not isolated ones. Is it true that higher normal schools do not need good students? May I ask, if those with good foundations are all "guided" not to apply to normal schools, and the quality of teachers trained by normal schools cannot be guaranteed, then how will the grades of the students they teach be? This is very worthy of attention from all parties.
    In addition, regarding the teachers themselves. As a part of the working class in the new China, our teachers should recognize that the political status of people's teachers is essentially different from that in the old society, and should further recognize their responsibilities and the significance of their work, and see the glorious responsibility that teachers bear for the future of the motherland. We should not overemphasize issues such as material living conditions, but should strictly demand ourselves, improve our communist consciousness, promote the style of hard work and plain living, and become a model for establishing a new atmosphere. We must constantly improve our political and professional level, actively study educational theory, master educational principles, strengthen scientific research, improve educational quality, and become a human soul engineer worthy of the name, so as to cultivate all-round talents with both ability and integrity for the motherland. So as to be worthy of the deep concern and love of the Party and government, and to live up to the great trust and entrustment of the people.
    I am not here to unilaterally emphasize the importance of higher normal schools, but precisely to prepare more and better reserve forces for various professions in the construction cause. At present, the number of middle school students is insufficient, and teacher training cannot keep up with the needs. The proportion of higher normal school enrollment is very high every year, and some young people "especially" belittle the work of people's teachers, which is a serious problem that must be vigorously solved. Therefore, I would like to express my personal views, please give me your advice and support.

    重视师范教育和人民教师工作
    ——陈垣代表的发言
    请允许我就高等师范教育问题说几句话。
    今年中学和大学的招生工作都遇到了一种新的情况，就是计划招生名额超过投考的应届毕业生人数。高中毕业生人数比高等学校计划招生名额少；初中毕业生人数比高中和中等专业学校计划招生名额少。这就是说初中与高中之间、高中与大学之间都成了供不应求的情况。这情况说明我们的社会主义建设事业是在一日千里迅速飞跃的前进，高级和中级专门人才的需要量大大增加；但也说明我们的中等教育已远远不能适应需要，必需大量发展，不然将会给国家经济建设造成很大困难。
    想要多办中学，最主要的困难，就是师资不足，正如教育部张奚若部长在大会上发言所指出的：“中小学师资不够的问题越来越显得严重”。“在1956和1957两年内，估计中学师资缺少约9万人左右，小学师资缺少约20万人左右”。这是多么大的数字，我觉得政府所采取的扩大高师招生名额，发展短期师范班和发掘潜在人力种种措施，都是极重要的，我个人表示非常同意和拥护。
    但是我觉得还有一个问题，值得引起各方注意，就是如何进一步加强社会上对人民教师工作的重视和尊敬，以更有效的保证师范生的来源，以加强教师对自己工作的热爱和责任感。
    几年来，成千上万的青年由于认识到人民教育事业的重要意义，根据自己的条件，考进了师范学校。很多青年已经担负起教师的神圣职责，坚持在教育战线上辛勤的为祖国培育着下一代，这是主要的一方面。但是另一方面，还有一部分青年，看不起师范，认为学师范不光彩，没前途，待遇低，不能做科学研究。因此，明明自己条件适合于学师范，也有所顾虑，踌躇不前。前几天“教师报”上编者按语说：有的青年“重理轻文，特别是轻视人民教师的工作”，既然加上“特别是”，这问题就不能不引起重视了。
    所以有这样现象，我想主要原因有下列几点：
    1、旧社会的思想影响：由于旧社会统治阶级根本不愿意人民受到教育，不重视教育事业，自然就不会重视教师。教师在旧社会一向被人轻视，社会地位低，工资少，甚至不能养家糊口。所以有人只把教师这职业做为“暂时栖身之所”，只要有其他办法，就不愿再做教员，这是很自然的事情。旧社会的长期影响，不可能一时全部肃清，仍相当广泛的残存在一部分人的思想意识里，常常有意无意的影响着青年，妨碍了他们对新社会人民教师的正确看法。
    2、我们经常的宣传教育不够：青年毕竟还年轻，有时看问题不免片面，需要行政机关、学校和青年团帮助他们正确的认识各项专业在国家建设中所起的作用，帮助并指导他们实事求是的选择志愿，使他们认识到各种专业的设施都是重要的，不要不恰当的强调某专业重要或某专业不重要。比如教师工作，原是非常重要的，但有的同学认为不如工业建设那样轰轰烈烈，他们看不到教师工作在建设中的作用。如果是修水库，建大桥，几年之后就可以看到自己参与的工作已发挥巨大作用，造福于人民。但是教师的工作是“百年树人”，从小学到大学毕业要16或17年，再加上幼儿园，时间就更长了。这种劳动是不能马上看到成果的。实际上教师的工作，是培养人的工作，他的工作成绩，是灌注在每一件造福人民的建设工作里，是收效于每一个学校毕业的工作人员的身上。对于这样的基本性的建设工作，应当经常的在青年中间做好宣传，在社会上形成一种新的舆论，使青年和其他人士有正确的认识。如果单靠每年在招生时的临时指导，所收效果总是不大的。
    3、教师直接给青年们的印象：学生接触教师的机会最多，教师所给予学生的影响也最大。这应当分两方面来看：一方面，如果学生看到自己老师的工作一直是忙乱，生活条件不好，甚至有的地区教师还得不到应有的重视，那末，当青年们自己选择志愿的时候，就很难选择去学师范。另一方面，就是做教师的人，自己不钻研业务，不注意道德品质的修养，甚至专业思想还没有树立，不安心工作。这样的教师在“潜移默化”之中，就给学生以很不好的影响，使他们觉得教师工作没有意义。
    根据这些情况，我们应当采取有效的具体措施，进一步把师范教育和人民教师工作重视起来，把人民教师的地位和待遇，恰当的提到应有的高度。我想，我们可以参考伟大的导师列宁在他的“日记摘录”里所说的话，他说：“应当把我国国民教师的地位提升到是资产阶级社会的教师们所始终不能达到的高度上。这乃是无待证明的真理。我们为了这点，就必须进行有系统的、一往直前的工作，既要提高教师的精神状态，也要使他们拥有各方面的修养，以期真正符合他们的崇高称呼，而最主要的是要提高他们的物质生活条件。”我们今后不仅应当加强经常性的思想宣传教育，而且还应当注意一些实际问题，如教师的政治待遇，社会地位，生活条件，工资报酬等等。这样做，不但可以把旧社会遗留下的影响，逐渐肃清，而且也可以使人民教师在精神上和物质上得到极大的鼓励。当然，我们的党和政府一直就重视并关怀人民教师的工作，不过，有些方面还做得不够；有些地区也还没有很好的贯彻执行。
    在思想教育工作上，我觉得有必要从中央到地方的各级领导同志作更多更具体的号召和指示，以促进社会上对人民教师的正确看法。加里宁，他是苏联共产党和政府主要领导人之一，不是给我们留下很多关于教育和教师的指导性的文章与报告吗？我们的各级领导同志是不是在这一问题上，注意得还不够呢？此外，我想我们的“中国青年”，“中国青年报”，
  “教师报”以及其他报刊杂志，也有责任在这一方面更多的做些工作。至少决不要再有像今年4月30日“中国青年报”一篇稿子的那样说法了。这篇稿子是回答一个中学即将毕业的学生想考大学物理系，请求指导的问题，他“指导”那个学生说：
  “如果你在理化方面的基础并不很好，那么，你去考师范也是一件很好的事情。”这样的“指导”，无异于告诉青年：基础好的就不要去考师范，理化基础好考师范未免可惜。而事实上师范物理系是不是就可以理化基础差呢？另外，还有一个例子，一位考上高师的学生写信报告他的家长，家长说：“你的成绩这样好，为什么考师范呢？”言下大有无限惋惜之意。这样的例子还是很多，并不是个别的。难道高师真是不需要功课好吗？请问基础好的如果都被“指导”得不考师范，师范培养出的教师质量不能保证，那末，他再去教出的学生，成绩又当如何呢？这是非常值得引起各方注意的。
    此外，关于教师本身方面。我们教师作为新中国工人阶级队伍里的一部分，应当认清：人民教师在政治上的地位已与旧社会有了本质的不同，应当更进一步的认识自己的职责和工作的意义，看到教师对祖国的未来所负的光荣责任。不能过分强调物质生活待遇等问题，应当严格的要求自己，提高共产主义觉悟，发扬艰苦朴素作风，成为树立新风气的榜样。必须不断的提高政治和业务水平，积极学习教育理论，掌握教育原则，加强科学研究，提高教育质量，做一个名实相符的人类灵魂工程师，为祖国培养出德才兼备的全面发展的人才。以无愧于党和政府的深切关心和爱护，以不辜负人民的极大信任和委托。
    我并不是在这里片面强调高师的重要，而正是为了如何给建设事业中的各种专业准备更多更好的后备力量。目前，中学学生数目不足，师范教育赶不上需要。每年高师招生名额的比重很高，而有的青年再“特别是”轻视人民教师的工作，这是一个必须大力解决的严重问题。因此，我愿说出我个人的看法，请大家指教，并给予支持。
