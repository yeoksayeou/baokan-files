Xinhua News Agency, June 25th - At the plenary session of the Third Meeting of the First National People's Congress held on the afternoon of the 25th, Li Weihan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, delivered a speech on united front work. In his speech, Li Weihan stated that the policy put forward by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and various democratic parties, with the primary emphasis on the supervision of the Communist Party, is a significant policy. The formulation of this policy once again declares that democratic cooperation with non-Party figures is a "fixed" and "unchanging" principle of the Communist Party.

Li Weihan said that in order to promote the tradition of political consultation, mutual assistance, and mutual supervision among the various democratic parties and people's organizations in our country, it is imperative to strictly respect the political freedom and organizational independence of the various democratic parties and people's organizations within the scope of the rights and obligations conferred by the Constitution. No party or organization has the right to interfere with such freedom and independence of other parties and organizations.

Today's meeting commenced at 3:00 PM. Dong Biwu, President of the Supreme People's Court, was the first to speak today. In his speech on the work of the people's courts, he emphasized that in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, the people's courts at all levels have played an active role in cooperating with and checking each other as the people's courts and the people's public security and procuratorial organs.

Eight representatives from Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors, namely Wang Xingyao, Liu Jingji, Rong Yiren, Hu Ziying, Hu Juewen, Guo Dihuo, Tang Di Yin, and Wei Ru, delivered a joint speech at today's meeting, read on their behalf by Hu Ziying. Based on their understanding of the situation in Shanghai's joint state-private industrial enterprises during their inspection tours, they cited many examples to criticize the commercial departments for setting unrealistic requirements for the quantity, variety, and quality of some commodities when processing orders for joint state-private factories, and for setting generally low processing fees for joint ventures. The eight representatives put forward suggestions for improvement, suggesting changing the current profit distribution between commercial departments and joint industry and transferring the production management of joint state-private industries from commercial departments to industrial specialized companies in order to concentrate efforts on sales work.

Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of Commerce, spoke on the supply of non-staple foods and the allocation of industrial products in commercial work.

Dao Jingban, a representative from the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, and Suo Guanying, a representative from the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, respectively described the development of various undertakings in their respective regions over the past year at today's meeting. Both of them cited specific examples to illustrate the new atmosphere that has emerged in these two regions after the democratic reforms.

Meng Tai, a model industrial worker from Anshan Iron and Steel, brought production news to the meeting. He said that in the first quarter and April and May of this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant had comprehensively overfulfilled its output, quality, and cost plans, and had ensured safe production.

Other representatives who spoke at today's meeting included Li Chengwo, Director of the State Bureau of Metrology; scientists Sheng Tongsheng and Chen Fengtong; engineering and technical personnel Wang Xuncai; Chen Jingyu, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan City; Zhang Yangfen, Vice President of Shanghai Second Medical College; and Ma Xingtai from Qinghai Province. These representatives successively expressed their opinions on the unified national measurement work, further development of scientific undertakings, the launch of a meritorious service campaign by private personnel in joint state-private enterprises in Wuhan, and how teaching and scientific research in universities and colleges should be combined. (Full texts of today's representatives' speeches will be published separately.)

Today's meeting concluded at 7:00 PM. The executive chairmen presiding over today's meeting were Saifuddin, Zhang Wentian, Xu Teli, Deng Chumin, Chen Jingyu, Ou Baichuan, Hu Yaobang, and Guoji Mugu.

    在全国人民代表大会会议上李维汉谈统一战线工作
    说明共产党和民主党派共同存在互相监督的方针
    据新华社25日讯　在二十五日下午举行的第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议的全体会议上，李维汉副委员长作了关于统一战线工作的发言。李维汉在发言中说，中共中央提出的关于共产党和各民主党派长期共同存在，互相监督，首先是对共产党起监督作用的方针，是一个重大的方针。这个方针的提出就再一次地宣告，同党外人士实行民主合作，是共产党的一条“固定不移”和“永远不变”的原则。
    李维汉说，为要发扬我国各民主党派和人民团体在政治上的互相协商、互相帮助和互相监督的传统，必须严格地尊重各民主党派和人民团体在宪法上赋予的权利义务范围内的政治自由和组织独立性，任何党派和团体对其他党派和团体的这种自由和独立，都没有权利加以干涉。
    今天的会议是从下午三时开始的。最高人民法院院长董必武今天第一个发言。他在他的关于人民法院工作的发言里着重指出，在肃清反革命分子斗争中，各级人民法院发挥了人民法院和人民公安、检察机关互相配合而又互相制约的积极作用。
    来自上海的工商业者王性尧、刘靖基、荣毅仁、胡子婴、胡厥文、郭棣活、汤蒂因、魏如等八位代表，在今天的会议上由胡子婴代表代读了一份联合发言。他们在联合发言中根据视察上海市公私合营工业中所了解的情况，举出了许多事例，批评商业部门在向公私合营工厂加工订货的时候，对有些商品的数量、品种、质量的规定不合实际情况，对合营工厂核定的工缴货价一般偏低等。八位代表提出了改进的意见，建议改变目前商业部门和合营工业之间的利润分配、把对公私合营工业的生产管理工作由商业部门移交给工业专业公司，以便能集中全力做好销售工作。
    商业部副部长姚依林就商业工作中的副食品供应和工业品调拨分配问题发言。
    云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州来的刀京版代表和四川省阿坝藏族自治州来的索观瀛代表，在今天的会议上分别叙述了他们所在的地区一年来各项事业发展的情况。他们两人都举出具体的事例说明这两个地区进行民主改革后出现的新气象。
    来自鞍钢的工业劳动模范孟泰代表，给会议带来了生产捷报。他说，鞍钢炼铁厂今年第一季度和四五月份都全面超额完成了产量、质量和成本计划，而且保证了安全生产。
    在今天会议上发言的代表，还有国家计量局局长李承斡，科学工作者盛彤笙、陈凤桐，工程技术人员王洵才，武汉市副市长陈经畬，上海第二医学院副院长章央芬和来自青海省的马兴泰。这些代表分别就统一全国计量工作、进一步发展科学事业、武汉市公私合营企业中私方人员开展立功运动、高等学校教学与科学研究应如何结合等方面的情况和问题，先后发表了自己的意见。（今天代表的发言全文另发）
