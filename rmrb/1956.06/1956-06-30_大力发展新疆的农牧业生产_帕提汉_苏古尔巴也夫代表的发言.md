I listened to the “Report on the Implementation of the 1955 National Budget and the 1956 National Budget” by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, and the "Report on the Model Regulations (Draft) of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" by Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture, and the work report of Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I fully agree and recommend that the Congress adopt them.

The model regulations (draft) of advanced agricultural production cooperatives proposed at the Congress are inseparable from the fundamental interests of the 500 million farmers in our country, and are in line with the urgent demands of the broad masses of farmers and the development prospects of agriculture. The regulations explicitly stipulate "payment according to work," "equal pay for equal work" regardless of gender or age, preferential treatment and care for revolutionary martyrs' families and demobilized soldiers, and women joining the cooperative, clarifying the relationship between members and the collective, the democratic management system of the cooperative, the entry of landlords and rich peasants into the cooperative and their transformation, and other issues. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, like the broad masses of farmers across the country, warmly and sincerely support these regulations, and under the encouragement of the spirit of these regulations, will give greater play to their production enthusiasm, improve labor efficiency, and rapidly and healthily complete the task of the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have achieved tremendous development in all aspects, especially in agricultural production cooperation. For example, in 1955, the total cultivated area of ​​crops in the region increased by 6.74% compared with 1954, and the total output increased by 5.49%; cotton increased by 67.1%; and oil crops increased by 18.37%. It is estimated that this year, the total grain output in Xinjiang will increase by 9.08% compared with 1955; cotton will increase by 72.05%; and oil crops will increase by 0.28%.

Animal husbandry occupies an important position in Xinjiang's national economy, with 10% of the region's population engaged in animal husbandry production. In addition, livestock raised in agricultural areas accounts for about half of the total number of livestock. Due to the correct implementation of the Party's pastoral area policies and the active efforts of the broad masses of herdsmen to develop animal husbandry production, the number of livestock of all kinds in Xinjiang increased by 9.79% in 1955 compared with 1954. Significant achievements have also been made in improving livestock breeds. It is estimated that in 1956, it can increase by more than 11% compared with 1955, and the total number of livestock can reach 20,932,500.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Resolution on Agricultural Cooperation of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang was greatly encouraged. At all levels of leadership, the right-leaning conservative ideology was criticized and overcome more thoroughly, so a high tide of agricultural production cooperation movement was set off from the autumn of last year. By the first quarter of this year, the number of farmers joining primary agricultural cooperatives increased from the original 5.3% to 91.93%. The establishment of advanced cooperatives is also developing rapidly. According to statistics as of the end of May, a total of 2,411 advanced cooperatives have been established, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives accounts for 42.05% of the total number of farmers. It is expected that the work of establishing advanced agricultural cooperatives throughout Xinjiang will be basically completed in the autumn and spring of this year.

When the news of the vigorous socialist transformation movement in cities and rural areas spread to the pastoral areas, the broad masses of herdsmen put forward the demand for socialist transformation, saying: We also want to take the road of cooperation to socialism. From 1955 to the end of May 1956, a total of 102 animal husbandry production cooperatives have been established throughout Xinjiang (excluding 178 cooperatives in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas). More than 2% of herdsmen in purely pastoral areas have joined the cooperatives. If the mutual aid teams for animal husbandry are included, it is equivalent to 40% of the pastoral population being organized. The cooperative movement is currently developing, and it is estimated that by the end of this year, 10% of the total number of households in Xinjiang will participate in cooperatives.

However, our work is still not done well enough, and there are still shortcomings and errors in some work. In the agricultural cooperation movement, we have not studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and instructions deeply enough, and we have not given a timely and ruthless exposure to the right-leaning conservative ideology. In actual work, the phenomenon of leaders lagging behind the masses has occurred. The potential strength in agricultural production has not been tapped enough, and different technical plans have not been formulated according to the different conditions of each region. We have also failed to give due attention to the development of animal husbandry, etc. But we are confident that we will thoroughly examine and overcome shortcomings and errors, and strive to do a good job in the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry, and vigorously develop the movement of agricultural and animal husbandry production.

### 大力发展新疆的农牧业生产——帕提汉·苏古尔巴也夫代表的发言

    大力发展新疆的农牧业生产
    ——帕提汉·苏古尔巴也夫代表的发言
    我听了国务院副总理、财政部长李先念关于“1955年国家预算的执行和1956年国家预算的报告”，听了农业部长廖鲁言关于“农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的报告”，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长彭真的工作报告。我完全同意并建议大会予以通过。
    大会上提出的高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）是和我国5亿农民的根本利益分不开的，是和广大农民群众的迫切要求以及农业的发展前途相符合的。在章程里明文规定了“按劳取酬”，不分男女老少“同工同酬”，规定了烈军属和复员军人以及妇女们的入社优待照顾办法，明确了社员和集体的关系，社的民主管理制度，地主富农的入社和对他们的改造等问题。因此，我们新疆维吾尔自治区的各族人民对于这一章程，如同全国广大农民群众一样，热烈的衷心的拥护，并在这个章程精神的鼓舞下，发挥更大的生产积极性，提高劳动效率，迅速而健康地完成农业的社会主义改造任务。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的各民族人民，在中国共产党毛主席领导下，各方面都有了巨大的发展，尤其是在农业生产合作化方面获得了巨大成就，例如1955年全区农作物耕种面积比1954年增加了6.74％，总产量增加5.49％；棉花增加67.1％；油料作物增加18.37％。预计今年全疆粮食总产量比1955年将增加9.08％；棉花增加72.05％；油料作物增加0.28％。
    牧畜业在新疆国民经济中占着重要地位，全疆有10％的人口从事牧畜业生产。此外在农业地区兼营牧畜业的牲畜约占牲畜总数的一半。由于党的牧区政策的正确执行，和广大牧民发展牧畜业生产的积极努力，因而全疆各种牲畜在1955年比1954年增加了9.79％。在改良牲畜品种方面也获得了显著的成绩。预计在1956年比1955年可以增加到11％强，计牲畜总数可达到20，932，500头。
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以及中共七届六中全会关于农业合作化的决议公布以后，大大鼓舞了新疆各民族人民的积极性。在各级领导上，较深入的批判和克服了右倾保守思想，因而从去年秋天开始掀起了农业生产合作化运动的高潮，至今年第一季度止，加入初级农业合作社的农户由原有的5.3％增加到91.93％。高级社的建立也正在迅速开展着。截止5月底的统计，共建立了高级社2，411处，入社的农户占总农户的42.05％，预计在今秋明春全疆农业高级社建社工作将基本上完成。
    当城市和农村的轰轰烈烈的开展社会主义改造运动的消息传到牧区以后，广大的牧民群众纷纷提出了社会主义改造的要求，他们说：我们也要通过合作化的道路走向社会主义。从1955年起到1956年5月底为止，全疆已经试办了102处牧畜业生产合作社（半农半牧地区的178个合作社未包括进去），全牧业地区的2％强的牧户已加入了社，如果将牧业互助组计算在内，相当于40％的牧业人口已经组织起来了。目前合作运动正在发展，预计在今年底将有占全疆总户数10％的牧户参加合作社。
    但是，我们的工作还是做得不够的，有些工作还存在缺点和错误。在农业合作化运动中，对于毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和指示还学习的不够深刻，对于右倾保守思想我们没有及时予以无情的揭发，在实际工作中产生了领导落后于群众的现象。在农业生产方面发掘潜在力量不够，未能按照各个地区的不同情况制订出不同的技术方案。对于牧畜业的发展也未给予应有的重视等等。但我们有信心深入检查克服缺点错误，努力做好农牧业的社会主义改造工作，大力发展农牧业生产运动。
