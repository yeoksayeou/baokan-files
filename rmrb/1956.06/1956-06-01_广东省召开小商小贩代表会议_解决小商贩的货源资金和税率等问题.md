Guangdong Province Convenes Meeting of Small Vendor Representatives
To Resolve Issues Concerning Supply of Goods, Funding, and Tax Rates for Small Vendors

    Guangdong Province convened its first provincial meeting of small vendor representatives from May 20th to 26th, studying and resolving many specific issues in the current socialist transformation work of small vendors.

    Since the upsurge in the socialist transformation of small vendors in Guangdong Province began in January of this year, significant achievements have been made. More than 74% of the province's small vendors have been incorporated into various forms of transformation. The socialist consciousness and business enthusiasm of these small vendors are gradually increasing. Many regions have seen small vendors adopting methods such as "carrying goods to villages" and "delivering goods to homes" to expand their businesses, support agricultural production, and simultaneously increase their income. However, many problems still exist. The main issue is that some regions have not adopted diverse forms of transformation based on the business characteristics of small vendors, causing some difficulties in their operations and even causing ideological confusion among some small vendors.

    In response to these situations, the meeting first clarified and affirmed that small vendors are independent laborers engaged in commodity circulation and that their operations and lives should be well arranged. The meeting believed that any form of transformation that hinders production and operation, is detrimental to small vendors, or inconvenient to consumers should be changed. State-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives should strengthen their leadership in the transformation of small vendors, ensure the supply of goods to small vendors, assist them in solving funding difficulties, and guarantee them reasonable income. The meeting put forward opinions for adjustment and improvement regarding inappropriate practices in the distribution of goods, the determination of wholesale and retail price differences and agency commissions, the regulations on tax rates and tax procedures, and bank loans.

    More than 390 small vendor representatives from all over the province expressed satisfaction with the meeting and stated that they would actively improve their operations and serve the cause of socialist construction.

    广东省召开小商小贩代表会议
    解决小商贩的货源资金和税率等问题
    广东省在五月二十日到二十六日召开了第一次全省的小商小贩代表会议，研究解决了当前小商小贩社会主义改造工作中的许多具体问题。
    广东省小商小贩的社会主义改造工作自从今年一月进入高潮以来，已经取得很大成绩。全省74％以上的小商小贩已经分别纳入各种改造形式。这些小商贩的社会主义觉悟和经营积极性都在逐步提高。不少地区的小商贩采取了“担货串乡”、“送货上门”等办法，扩大了业务，支援了农业生产，同时增加了收入。但是也还存在着不少问题。主要是有些地区没有根据小商贩的经营特点采取多种改造形式，使小商小贩在经营上还存在一些困难，甚至还引起一部分小商贩的思想混乱。
    会议针对这些情况，首先明确肯定了小商小贩是从事商品流转的独立劳动者，应该很好地安排他们的经营和生活。会议认为，凡是对生产经营有妨碍，对小商贩不利，对消费者不便的改造形式，应该加以改变。国营公司和供销合作社应该加强对小商小贩改造工作的领导，要保证小商贩的货源供应，要协助他们解决资金的困难，保证他们有合理的收入。会议对过去货源的分配、批零差价和代销手续费的订定、税率和税收手续的规定以及银行贷款等工作中不恰当的作法，都提出了调整和改进的意见。
    来自全省各地的三百九十多名小商贩代表都对这次会议表示满意，纷纷表示回去要积极搞好经营，为社会主义建设事业服务。
