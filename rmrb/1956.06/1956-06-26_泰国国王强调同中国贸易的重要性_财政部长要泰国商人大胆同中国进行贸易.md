Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: According to Agence France-Presse, Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej told the Thai Parliament on June 24th that Thailand must trade with all countries. He particularly emphasized the importance of establishing trade relations with China.

Bhumibol Adulyadej presided over the opening of the new session of the Thai Parliament yesterday. In his speech, he stressed the need for a strong defense for Thailand and the need to expand trade.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, Bangkok Dispatch: Thai newspapers reported that the Thai Minister of Finance and Acting Minister of Economic Affairs, Phra Prakas Sahakorn Yutthakit, said that he believes that the organization of a delegation by Thai business people to China to investigate business opportunities will help promote trade between Thailand and China.

Phra Prakas Sahakorn Yutthakit, when speaking to the press on June 19th, asked Thai business people to dispel their doubts and concerns and boldly engage in trade of non-strategic materials with China.

The "Thai People's Daily" published an editorial on June 20th, commenting on the Thai government's decision to lift the trade ban on timber and rice to China, saying that prohibiting trade with a country of 600 million people—an old customer of Thailand in Asia—should be considered a form of self-imposed imprisonment. What is even more serious is that when Thailand does not sell goods to China, others are freely trading with China.

The "Thai People's Daily" said that the Thai government's decision to develop trade with China due to consideration of various important facts in the laws of economic development and other reasons will gradually improve the already shrinking Thai market. The newspaper also said that opening up this economic self-imprisonment indicates that Thailand is moving towards a normal and correct economic path, and the ultimate result will be good.

    泰国国王强调同中国贸易的重要性
    财政部长要泰国商人大胆同中国进行贸易
    新华社25日讯　据法新社报道，泰国国王普密蓬·阿杜德六月二十四日对泰国议会说，泰国必须同一切国家贸易。他特别强调指出了同中国建立贸易关系的重要性。
    普密蓬·阿杜德昨天主持了泰国议会新的一届会议开幕。他在讲话中强调泰国需要强大的国防，需要扩大贸易。
    新华社24日讯　曼谷消息：泰国报纸报道，泰国财政部长兼代理经济部长拍母里攀·裕他吉说，他相信泰国商界人士组织代表团前往中国考察商业，是有助于促进泰中两国之间的贸易的。
    拍母里攀·裕他吉在六月十九日向报界发表谈话的时候要求泰国商界人士不必再有怀疑和顾虑，大胆同中国进行非战略物资的贸易。
    “泰人报”六月二十日发表社论，评论泰国政府决定解除木材和大米对中国的贸易禁令说，禁止同有六亿人口的国家——泰国在亚洲的老主顾进行贸易，应当被认为是一种自我禁锢。更严重的是当泰国不卖货物给中国的时候，别人却在自由自在地同中国进行贸易。
    “泰人报”说，泰国政府由于考虑到经济发展规律中的各项重要事实以及其他原因而开展同中国之间的贸易，这将使已经萎缩的泰国市场逐渐好转过来。这家报纸还说，打开在经济上的自我禁锢这件事表明，泰国正在向着正常和正确的经济途径前进，而最终的结果将是良好的。
