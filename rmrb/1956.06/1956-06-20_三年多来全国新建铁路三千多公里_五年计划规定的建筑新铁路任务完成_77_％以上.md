    This newspaper reports that, with the Lanxin Railway's track-laying reaching the Yumen East Station ahead of schedule, the total length of new railways laid during the First Five-Year Plan period has reached more than 3,100 kilometers. As of June 16th, over 77% of the new railway construction task specified in the First Five-Year Plan had been completed, leaving only 900 kilometers remaining.

    Since 1953, construction has begun on more than 20 new railways across the country. Trunk lines such as the Jier, Fengsha, Lizhan, and Lanyan railways have been completed and are open to traffic. The Lanxin Railway has already completed the task specified in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The Baoji-Chengdu and Yingtan-Xiamen trunk lines will also complete their respective Five-Year Plan construction tasks ahead of schedule.

    As of the 16th, the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway had been laid to a point just over three kilometers from the junction at Huangsha River, and the northern section was only thirteen kilometers from the junction. Track-laying on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway has passed Qingzhou Station, and the overall track-laying project is more than 40% complete. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is being constructed simultaneously from both the north and south ends. The southern section's track-laying has crossed the Yellow River Bridge at Donggang Town, and the northern section has been laid more than twenty kilometers out of Baotou. Construction of the second railway trunk line connecting inside and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass—the Beijing-Chengde Railway—has also begun with track-laying from the northern end.

    According to the First Five-Year Plan, an average of 817 kilometers of new railway should be built each year. More than 500 kilometers have been completed in the first five and a half months of this year.

    三年多来全国新建铁路三千多公里
    五年计划规定的建筑新铁路任务完成77％以上
    本报讯　随着兰新铁路提前铺轨到玉门东站，第一个五年计划期间新建铁路铺轨数量达到了三千一百多公里。第一个五年计划规定的建筑新铁路的任务，到六月十六日已经完成77％以上，剩下来的只有九百公里了。
    从1953年以来，全国先后动工修建的新铁路有二十多条。集二、丰沙、黎湛、蓝烟等干线已经先后修建完成，全线通车；兰新铁路已经提前完成了第一个五年计划规定的任务；宝成、鹰厦等干线，也将提前完成五年计划规定的修建任务。
    到十六日止，宝成铁路南段已经铺轨到距离黄沙河接轨点三公里多的地方，北段距离接轨点也只有十三公里了。鹰厦铁路铺轨已过青州车站，全线铺轨工程已经完成40％以上。包兰铁路正在南北两段分头修建，南段铺轨过了东岗镇的黄河大桥，北段已经由包头铺出二十多公里。沟通关内外的第二条铁路干线——北京到承德的铁路，也开始从北端铺轨。
    按照第一个五年计划的规定，每年平均要修建817公里新铁路，今年前五个半月已修成五百多公里。
