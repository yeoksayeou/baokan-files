Explanation on the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
(June 15, 1956, at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress)
Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China

Chairman, Fellow Deputies:

Entrusted by the State Council, I would like to make the following explanation to the National People's Congress regarding the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, for your reference in discussing this draft.

I. First, I would like to briefly discuss the current situation of the agricultural collectivization movement and agricultural production.

It has been almost a year since the Second Session of this Congress was convened in July 1955. During this period, extremely great and profound changes have taken place in the rural areas of the country. At this time last year, the number of farming households joining agricultural producers' cooperatives accounted for only 14% of the total number of farming households in the country, and advanced cooperatives were only being tried out on an individual basis. Now the task of agricultural collectivization has been basically completed. The number of farming households joining advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives alone has reached 61% of the total number of farming households in the country. The advanced cooperative, which is completely socialist in nature, has become the main organizational form of agricultural production, and the face of the small-peasant economy in the countryside has been fundamentally changed.

At the same time, the upsurge of the socialist revolution in the countryside has also brought about an upsurge in agricultural production. In 1955, the total grain output reached 368 billion jin, and cotton reached 30.36 million dan, both of which exceeded the plan. Except for sugarcane, the output of other cash crops increased significantly compared with 1954. In terms of animal husbandry, in addition to pigs, cattle, horses, and sheep also increased. Winter production, water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and various preparations for spring plowing were all done better than in previous years. This year's spring plowing and sowing work has generally been done earlier, faster, and better. Technical measures to increase production, such as seed selection and close planting, have also been promoted on a larger scale than in previous years, and the seedlings are generally growing vigorously. Except for a few places that have suffered losses due to rainstorms, the wheat in most areas has been harvested or is being harvested. This year's summer harvest is generally a bumper harvest. In terms of agricultural production increase, the superiority of the collective management of agricultural producers' cooperatives has been clearly demonstrated.

However, there are still problems in agricultural collectivization and agricultural production, and there are still many shortcomings and problems in our work. In terms of agricultural collectivization, some agricultural producers' cooperatives have experienced relatively serious phenomena of extravagance and waste, and abuse of the manpower and materials of the cooperatives. In some places, the valuation of the draught animals entering the cooperative was not reasonable enough, and the cooperative's management of the feeding of publicly owned livestock was not done well, which caused the draught animals to become thin and die. The labor intensity of some cooperatives is too high, and not enough attention is paid to safety protection in the labor of the members, and not enough consideration is given to the physiological characteristics of female members. In agricultural producers' cooperatives, correctly handling the relationship between the individual members and the collective, and correctly combining the individual interests of the members with the collective interests of the cooperative, and overcoming the tendency to one-sidedly emphasize collective and national interests while neglecting individual interests, is the central key to further consolidating and developing agricultural producers' cooperatives.

In terms of agricultural production, the production increase targets set by some places and some agricultural producers' cooperatives are too high and unrealistic, with high enthusiasm but insufficient reliability. In the promotion of new-style agricultural tools, not enough attention has been paid to regional adaptability, and technical guidance has not kept up, so "hanging plows" have reappeared in some places. Grain production is the basic sector in the agricultural economy, and it is right to emphasize the increase in grain and cotton production; however, it is wrong to only emphasize grain and cotton and neglect other cash crops. It is also wrong to only emphasize agricultural production and neglect forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, rural handicrafts, and other sideline occupations, which account for a large proportion of farmers' income. In the previous period, the shortcomings of many places and many agricultural producers' cooperatives were precisely: simply emphasizing grain and cotton production, neglecting other cash crops, neglecting the development of livestock, and neglecting various sideline productions. If these productions are neglected, even if there is a bumper harvest of grain and cotton, it will not increase the income of farmers, and may even reduce it. Therefore, the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems should be given serious attention.

On March 27, 1956, the State Council issued instructions on spring plowing and production. On April 3, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly issued instructions on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. Then, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao pointed out that it is necessary to ensure that 90% of the cooperatives increase production, strive for 90% of the members to increase their personal income, and correctly handle the relationship between the individual members and the collective. In places where these instructions have been earnestly implemented, the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems in agricultural production and agricultural collectivization have basically been corrected; in places where these instructions have not been fully implemented, the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems still exist, and much work still needs to be done.

Some of the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems in agricultural production and agricultural collectivization are issues in the implementation of work, and are not suitable for stipulating in the regulations of the cooperative. Some of them can be stipulated in the regulations of the cooperative, and have already been incorporated into this draft.

II. The Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives is rewritten on the basis of the Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives. The Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives were promulgated in draft form on November 9, 1955, and formally adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on March 17, 1956. It has been unanimously approved by the broad masses of peasants and has been widely adopted by agricultural producers' cooperatives. The Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Cooperatives, which is now submitted to the Congress for discussion, is based on the Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives, targeting the new problems arising after the transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, and based on the new experience in the construction of agricultural producers' cooperatives. All the original contents of the Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives that are approved by the broad masses of members and are still applicable to advanced cooperatives have been retained; all the articles that are no longer applicable to advanced cooperatives have been modified as necessary. At the same time, in order to solve the new problems arising after the upgrading of cooperatives, some new content has been added; new experiences in the agricultural collectivization movement have also been absorbed, and some relevant articles have been written more clearly than the Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives.

The Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives is simpler in wording than the Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives. In the Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives, there are many explanatory articles. Because agricultural producers' cooperatives are new things, and the meaning of many systems and practices of the cooperatives, and why they are done that way, were still unfamiliar to the general peasants at that time. Therefore, it was necessary and in line with the requirements of the collectivization movement and the requirements of the broad masses of peasants to make some explanations and descriptions in the first Model Regulations for Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives in our country. In the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, these explanatory articles do not need to be repeated; therefore, this Draft Model Regulations submitted to the Congress for review is much more concise.

In the process of drafting the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, cadres in charge of agricultural collectivization work from various places were involved in the drafting, and opinions were solicited from responsible comrades from various places, and multiple revisions were made. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also organized a symposium for discussion, and necessary revisions were made based on the opinions raised in the symposium. It was discussed and approved by the 31st Plenary Meeting of the State Council on June 14, and was decided by the 42nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to submit it to the National People's Congress for review and approval.

III. Regarding the content of the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, I will only make the following explanations on several issues.

First, regarding the public ownership of major means of production.

Elementary cooperatives implement land shares and unified management on a private basis. Advanced cooperatives implement complete collective ownership of the major means of production. This is the fundamental difference between elementary cooperatives and advanced cooperatives.

The main means of agricultural production are land, draught animals, and large agricultural tools (including sideline tools needed for collective sideline management).

The public ownership of draught animals and agricultural tools has already begun in the elementary stage of the cooperative. The method of public ownership of draught animals and agricultural tools is to value them and contribute them to the cooperative. The surplus price, after deducting the share fund that should be paid, is repaid by the cooperative in installments. This has been clearly stipulated in the Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives. Facts have proved that this method is deeply supported by the peasants and is an effective way to protect draught animals and agricultural tools and avoid serious damage during the upsurge of agricultural collectivization. Therefore, the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives has adopted this method as before, without any changes.

The method of transferring land to the collective ownership of the cooperative is not stipulated in the Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives. The Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives stipulates that the members' land must be transferred to the collective ownership of the cooperative and land remuneration must be abolished. Why not adopt the method of valuing and buying the members' land? This is because the nature of land as a means of production is different from draught animals and agricultural tools; and after the land reform, the land occupied by the peasants is roughly average, and generally not much different, which is different from the situation where the occupation of draught animals and agricultural tools varies greatly. Therefore, when the land is transferred to collective ownership, it should not and need not adopt the method of valuing and buying it. The practice of the movement has also proved that when the cooperative is upgraded from elementary to advanced, the peasants are in favor of abolishing land remuneration and transferring the land to the collective ownership of the cooperative, and are not in favor of valuing the land and contributing it to the cooperative. Especially after the Draft National Agricultural Development Program proposed the "five guarantees" for members who lack or have lost their ability to work, it has dispelled the concerns of members who lack or have lost their ability to work, and they also actively support abolishing land remuneration and realizing land public ownership. Some people also ask, why does advanced cooperative implement collective ownership of land instead of state ownership of land? This is because land ownership by the collective of the cooperative is easily accepted by the broad masses of peasants and can equally guarantee the normal progress of socialist economic construction; if state ownership of land is implemented, it may cause misunderstandings among the peasants.

After advanced collectivization, how to deal with the land occupied by urban residents in rural areas is a matter of concern to some people. Article 15 of the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives stipulates: "People who are engaged in urban occupations and whose families live in the city, the land in the countryside that belongs to them can be handed over to the cooperative for use. If the owner has difficulties in life and has historically relied on the land as part of their living allowance, the cooperative should take care of them and pay them a certain remuneration. If the owner is willing to move to the countryside and engage in agricultural production in the future, the cooperative should absorb them into the cooperative or return the original land to them for use." Such provisions take into account both the situation that the peasants' land has been collectively owned and the difficulties in the lives of some people who have land in the countryside but live in the city; it not only hands over these lands to the cooperative for use, which is conducive to the development of production, but also preserves the land ownership of these people. Therefore, this provision is reasonable and justifiable.

Regarding the issue of trees entering the cooperative, Article 18 of the Draft Regulations clearly stipulates that a small number of scattered trees do not enter the cooperative and remain the private property of the members; when a large number of continuous trees enter the cooperative, they can be valued and transferred to the collective ownership of the cooperative, and the price will be paid by the cooperative in installments from the income of the trees; in the early stage of the establishment of the cooperative, they can also not be publicly owned by the cooperative, but adopt a transitional method of unified management and distribution of dividends in proportion to trees and labor. The purpose of this provision is to protect forests from being destroyed.

Second, regarding the transformation of rich peasants.

The Model Regulations for Elementary Cooperatives promulgated last year made relatively strict provisions on the admission of former landlord elements and rich peasant elements into the cooperative. This was absolutely necessary at the time.

Due to the development of the upsurge of the socialist revolution in the countryside, well-to-do middle peasants have also joined the agricultural producers' cooperative along with poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and the rich peasant class has been rapidly and finally completely isolated. The tide of socialist collectivization cannot be resisted. The former landlord elements and rich peasant elements have also realized this. At the same time, due to the basic realization of agricultural collectivization, the implementation of socialist measures such as supply and marketing cooperation, credit cooperation, and the unified purchase and sale of grain and cotton in rural areas, the rich peasants have had to give up exploitation. At the same time, they have received a great deal of education in the process of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and have gradually realized that joining the cooperative is more beneficial than not joining. These political and economic factors have caused a clear differentiation among the former landlord elements and rich peasant elements. Although a small number of people continue to resist and undermine the collectivization movement, and another part of the people are in a state of wavering and watching, most people have expressed their acceptance of transformation. Therefore, in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967, in light of the situation that the former landlord elements and the rich peasant elements who have abandoned exploitation have been differentiated, a method of treating them differently is adopted, and they are placed in the cooperative for transformation. The provisions of Article 8 of the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives regarding the admission of former landlord and rich peasant elements into the cooperative are consistent with the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program.

The former landlord elements have generally declined economically due to the land reform. And some of the former rich peasant elements have also declined due to the land reform, while others have maintained the economic status of rich peasants after the land reform, and in addition, a small number of new rich peasants have emerged after the land reform, and they occupy more means of production. So, how should we deal with the means of production they occupy when they join the cooperative? Article 21 of the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives stipulates that when rich peasant elements who have abandoned exploitation participate in the cooperative, the price of all the means of production entering the cooperative, except for deducting the share of the share fund and supplementing a share of the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, the rest is used as the extra share fund. Why do we take this approach to the property of rich peasants? Because the rich peasants in our country are semi-feudal, and they have always had inextricable links with landlords in rural areas; they exploit the peasants to varying degrees, and politically they do not stand on the side of the peasants; at the same time, the rich peasants in our country are very small economically, their production and management are also backward, and they do not make any contribution to the national economy. Therefore, it is more appropriate to take such an approach to the property of rich peasants.

Third, regarding the admission of families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized soldiers into the cooperative.

Martyrs and revolutionary soldiers are meritorious in the revolution and are the defenders of the motherland and the people, and should be respected by the people. Their families often have certain difficulties due to the lack of labor, and should be given state pensions and preferential treatment. At the same time, agricultural producers' cooperatives should also actively absorb families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents into the cooperative and give them appropriate care.

Demobilized soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have undergone long-term training in the army, and their political and cultural level is generally higher. Agricultural producers' cooperatives should warmly welcome demobilized soldiers into the cooperative, and should enable them to work together with other advanced elements in the cooperative to play their due leading role. In this regard, it is generally done well in practice.

Among the demobilized soldiers, there is also a type of person who revolted during the Liberation War, personnel who were peacefully liberated, and who later returned to their hometowns for production after demobilization. As long as they are willing to participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives and engage in agricultural labor, they should also be absorbed into the cooperative. Because, if they were originally from working people, they should naturally be absorbed into the cooperative. If they were from landlords or rich peasants, the former landlord elements and the rich peasant elements who have abandoned exploitation can also be absorbed into the cooperative according to different circumstances. Since they are personnel who revolted, they should have more conditions for joining the cooperative than ordinary landlord elements and rich peasant elements. If they have had evil deeds in the past in the local area, their revolt should also be regarded as an expression of repentance and meritorious service, and they should be allowed to join the cooperative after the procedure of review and approval by the township people's committee. Of course, this latter type of person is prone to cause disputes in rural areas. On the one hand, the peasant masses should be educated to take care of the meritorious service of these people in the uprising, and adopt a lenient attitude towards their historical behavior, and not hold them accountable for the past; on the other hand, these people should also be educated to admit their mistakes to the masses in order to obtain the understanding of the masses.

Fourth, regarding the special interests of women members.

Articles 2, 33, 44, 49, 50, 56, and 60 of the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives make corresponding provisions for the special interests of women members. At present, some agricultural producers' cooperatives do not pay enough attention to this aspect, and turn "attaching importance to women's labor" into "heavy use of women's labor," so that some women members work excessively, which affects their health. The proportion of women among the cadres of the cooperative is too small, or even non-existent, and some cooperatives do not even have a woman among the director and deputy directors. These shortcomings should be quickly corrected.

The management committee of the cooperative, the production team leader, and the production group leader must pay close attention to the physiological characteristics and physical strength of women members when assigning labor tasks to members; take care of the actual needs of women members to engage in housework; at the same time, they should also explain clearly to the women members and persuade them not to reluctantly undertake labor that they cannot handle because of competing for work points or saving face, so as not to get sick from overwork.

Agricultural producers' cooperatives should organize welfare facilities that are specially needed by women members, such as childcare organizations during busy farming seasons, etc.; however, they must be organized according to the amount of public welfare funds and should only be gradually organized with the development of production and the increase of public welfare funds. Because agricultural producers' cooperatives are different from factories, and members of agricultural cooperatives are different from workers. In addition to receiving wages, workers hand over all the products they produce to the state. The products produced by the members of agricultural producers' cooperatives are distributed to the members individually, and the cooperative only retains a small amount of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund. Therefore, it is unreasonable and impossible to require the cooperative to organize welfare facilities for women members that exceed the limits that the cooperative's public welfare funds can afford. Of course, it is also wrong for agricultural producers' cooperatives not to pay attention to the special interests of women and not to organize some welfare facilities when they have the strength to do so.

Fifth, correctly handle the relationship between the individual members and the collective of the cooperative.

The Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives clearly and specifically stipulates that the collective interests of the cooperative must be correctly combined with the individual interests of the members. It stipulates the vegetable plots allocated to each member's household; scattered trees, small agricultural tools, and sideline tools needed for household sideline occupations do not enter the cooperative; members are allowed to engage in household sideline occupations; after members have done enough labor days in the cooperative according to the plan, the rest of the labor time is completely at the disposal of the members; and it is stipulated that agricultural producers' cooperatives should distribute according to the principle of both increasing the personal income of the members year by year and increasing the public accumulation of the cooperative; if the production of the cooperative does not increase much, the public accumulation fund can be reduced in order to increase the personal income of the members. These provisions are very necessary and guarantee the correct combination of the personal interests of the members and the collective interests, which will greatly improve the members' concern for the collective and will greatly benefit the development of agricultural production.

The interests of the state, the interests of the collective, and the long-term interests are of course fundamentally consistent with the local interests, individual interests, and current interests, but to a certain extent, they are also contradictory. The problem that general members are most concerned about is that they can increase their personal income after joining the cooperative, and they support socialism primarily because of this. And the cadres of the cooperative always want to run the cooperative in a magnificent way and accumulate more public property. However, if too much public accumulation is made, the personal income of the members will be reduced, and there will be contradictions. The main problem at present is that under the upsurge of the socialist revolution, collective interests have been overemphasized and individual interests have been neglected. This is detrimental to the development of agricultural production and the consolidation of the cooperative. Therefore, it is necessary to remind these cadres to pay attention to individual interests. Of course, if the individual interests of the members are unilaterally emphasized without regard to the collective interests and national interests, that is also wrong and detrimental to the members.

Sixth, strengthen the democratic management of the cooperative, and oppose coercion and commandism and bureaucracy.

Agricultural collectivization has been basically realized, and 100 million peasant households have been organized into more than 1 million cooperatives. Within the cooperative, there are layers of organizations such as the management committee, production teams, and production groups. This is of course necessary for managing collective production, and there are many benefits. However, this also brings a bad aspect, that is, it is easy to produce coercion and commandism and bureaucracy. Therefore, in Chapter 1 (General Provisions), Chapter 8 (Political Work), and Chapter 10 (Management Organization) of the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, democratic management is made the general principle of the cooperative, opposing coercion and commandism and bureaucracy is made an important part of the political work of the cooperative, and corresponding provisions are made in terms of organization. Emphasis is placed on promoting the role of the members' congress, increasing the power of the members' congress, and many major issues must be passed by a two-thirds majority of the members present; if it is impossible to convene the members' congress due to objective practical difficulties, and the members' representatives congress exercises the functions of the members' congress on behalf of the members' congress, Article 56 of the Draft Regulations stipulates that the number of representatives should not be too small, the representatives should be elected by the production unit, and before and after the meeting, a general meeting of the production team should be convened or a members' meeting should be convened by region to solicit everyone's opinions and convey the resolutions of the members' representatives congress. These provisions are all for the purpose of making the management work of the cooperative more democratic, so that the cadres of the cooperative can promote the excellent style of the mass line, and to establish the necessary organizational guarantees for running the cooperative well.

Seventh, regarding the issue of ethnic unity within the cooperative.

Our country is a multi-ethnic country, and agricultural producers' cooperatives in many places often encounter ethnic issues. This problem is not only encountered in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities and areas where ethnic groups live together, but also in the inland areas. Therefore, Articles 47 and 60 of the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives make corresponding provisions. At present, a few agricultural producers' cooperatives have shortcomings in this regard. Under the enthusiasm of the socialist revolution, they over-pursue the collective and the unity, and do not pay attention to respecting ethnic customs and habits, and do not pay attention to absorbing representatives of ethnic groups who account for a small proportion of the members in the leadership components of the cooperative. This should be corrected. Some joint cooperatives of Mongolian and Han people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have developed production and solved the agricultural and pastoral contradictions that could not be solved for many years because they took care of the ethnic characteristics and brought into play the strengths of the various ethnic groups after collective management. This experience is worth learning from everyone.

In addition, the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives has clear and specific provisions on issues such as running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and paying according to labor, and no further explanation is given here.

Please correct me if this explanation is not appropriate.

    关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明
    （1956年6月15日在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上）
    中华人民共和国农业部长　廖鲁言主席、各位代表：
    我受国务院的委托，对高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）向全国人民代表大会做如下的说明，供各位代表讨论这个章程草案的参考。一    首先，我想简单地讲一讲当前农业合作化运动和农业生产的情况。
    自从一九五五年七月召开的本届大会第二次会议到现在将近一年了。在这个期间，全国农村发生了极其伟大的深刻的变化。去年这个时候，加入农业生产合作社的农户只占全国农户总数的14％，高级社只是个别地试办。现在农业生产合作化的任务已经基本完成了，单是加入高级农业生产合作社的农户就已经达到全国农户总数的61％，完全社会主义性质的高级合作社已经成为农业生产的主要的组织形式，小农经济的农村面貌已经根本改观了。
    同时，农村中的社会主义革命的高潮也带来了农业生产的高潮。一九五五年粮食总产量达到3，680亿斤，棉花达到3，036万担，都超额完成了计划；除了甘蔗以外，其他经济作物的产量，都比一九五四年有显著的增加；在畜牧业方面，除了猪以外，牛、马、羊也有增加。冬季生产、兴修水利、积肥造肥和各种备耕工作，都比往年做得好。今年的春耕播种工作一般也做得较早、较快、较好，选种、密植等等增产的技术措施，也比往年获得更大范围的推广，禾苗一般长的也很旺盛。除了少数地方因暴雨成灾、遭受损失以外，大部地区的麦子已经收割或者正在收割，今年的夏收，一般是丰收的。在农业增产方面，已经清楚地表明了农业生产合作社集体经营的优越性。
    但是，在农业合作化和农业生产方面并不是没有问题的，工作中的缺点和毛病还是很多的。在农业合作化方面，有若干农业生产合作社，曾经发生过比较严重的铺张浪费和滥用合作社的人力、物力的现象。有的地方，对于入社的耕畜，作价不够合理，合作社对于公有牲畜的饲养管理工作也做得不好，因而引起耕畜的瘦弱死亡。有些合作社的劳动强度过于紧张，对于社员劳动中的安全保护注意不够，对于女社员的生理特点照顾不够。在农业生产合作社中，正确地处理社员个人同集体的关系，把社员个人的利益同合作社集体的利益正确地结合起来，克服片面地强调集体利益和国家利益而忽视个人利益的倾向，这是当前进一步巩固和发展农业生产合作社的中心关键。
    在农业生产方面，有些地方，有些农业生产合作社的增产指标定的过高，不切实际，积极性很高，而可靠性不够。在新式农具的推广工作中，对地区适应性注意不够，技术指导又跟不上去，因而在一部分地方又出现闲置起来的“挂犁”了。粮食生产是农业经济中的基础部门，强调粮食和棉花的增产，这是应该的；但是，只强调粮食、棉花，而忽视其他经济作物，则是不对的。只强调农业生产，而忽视在农民收入中占很大比重的林业、牧业、渔业、农村手工业和其他副业的生产，则是不对的。在前一个时期，许多地方，许多农业生产合作社的缺点，恰恰就是：单纯强调粮棉增产，忽视其他经济作物，忽视牲畜的发展，忽视各项副业生产。而如果忽视了这些生产，即使粮棉丰收，也不能使农民收入增加，甚至可能减少。所以上述的这些缺点和毛病，都是应该引起严重注意的。
    一九五六年三月二十七日国务院发出了关于春耕生产的指示，四月三日中共中央和国务院发出了关于勤俭办社的联合指示，接着中共中央和毛主席又指出，必须保证90％的合作社增加生产，争取90％的社员增加个人收入，正确地处理社员个人同集体的关系。凡是认真地执行了这些指示的地方，农业生产和农业合作化方面的上述缺点和毛病基本上都得到了纠正；凡是对于这些指示贯彻执行得不够好的地方，上述的缺点和毛病就仍然存在，还须做很多的工作。
    农业生产和农业合作化方面的上述缺点和毛病，有些是工作执行中的问题，不便在合作社章程中做条文性的规定，有些是可以在合作社章程中规定的，就已经吸收到这个章程草案之中了。二    高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案），是在初级合作社的示范章程的基础上改写的。供初级合作社采用的示范章程，在一九五五年十一月九日以草案形式公布，在一九五六年三月十七日由全国人民代表大会常务委员会正式通过，它得到了广大农民的一致赞同，为农业生产合作社所普遍采用。现在提请大会讨论的高级社的示范章程草案，就是以初级社的示范章程做基础，针对着初级合作社转为高级合作社以后所产生的新问题，根据农业生产合作社建设的新经验，起草出来的。凡是初级合作社示范章程中原有的内容，为广大社员所赞同，对于高级合作社仍然适用的，都仍然保留下来；凡是对于高级合作社已经不适用的条文，就做了必要的修改。同时，为了解决合作社升级后所产生的新问题，又增加了一些新的内容；还吸收了农业合作化运动的新经验，把一些有关的条文写得比初级社示范章程更加明确了。
    高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案，在文字上比初级合作社的示范章程简单了。在初级合作社的示范章程中，有许多解释性的条文。因为，农业生产合作社是新生的东西，合作社的许多制度和做法，它的涵义是什么，为什么要那样做，那时对于一般农民说来还是生疏的，所以在我国农业生产合作社的第一个示范章程中，适当地做一些解释和说明，是必要的，是合乎当时合作化运动的要求和广大农民群众的要求的。在高级农业生产合作社示范章程中，这些解释性的条文，就不必再重复了；所以提请大会审议的这个示范章程草案就比较简明得多。
    高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案，在起草过程中，曾经吸收了各地主管农业合作化工作的干部参加起草工作，并且征求了各地负责同志的意见，做了多次的修改；又由政协全国委员会组织了座谈会进行讨论，根据座谈中所提出的意见做了必要的修改，经国务院六月十四日第三十一次全体会议讨论通过，并且经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会第四十二次会议决定，提请全国人民代表大会审定。三    关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的内容方面，我只做以下几个问题的说明。
    第一，关于主要生产资料的公有化。
    初级合作社是在私有的基础上，实行土地入股、统一经营的。高级合作社实行主要生产资料的完全集体所有制。这是初级合作社同高级合作社的根本区别。
    农业生产的主要生产资料，就是土地、耕畜和大型农具（包括集体经营副业所需要的副业工具）。
    耕畜和农具的公有化，在合作社的初级阶段就已经开始了。耕畜和农具公有化的办法，是作价入社，除抵交应交的股份基金以外，多余的价款由合作社分期还清。这在供初级社采用的示范章程中已经有了明确的规定。事实证明：这种办法深得农民的拥护，这种办法是在农业合作化的高潮中，保护耕畜农具、避免发生严重破坏的有效办法。因此，在高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案中，照旧采取了这种办法，没有变动。
    土地转为合作社集体所有的办法，在供初级合作社采用的示范章程中是没有规定的。高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案就规定，社员的土地必须转为合作社集体所有，取消土地报酬。为什么对于社员的土地，不采取作价收买的办法呢？这是因为：土地这种生产资料，在性质上不同于耕畜和农具；而且经过土地改革以后，农民所占有的土地大体是平均的，一般相差不多，这同耕畜农具占有差别较大的情况是不相同的。所以在土地转为集体所有的时候，就不应该也不必要采取作价收买的办法。运动的实践也证明：当合作社由初级升高级的时候，农民是赞成取消土地报酬，把土地转为合作社集体所有，并不赞成把土地作价入社。尤其是在全国农业发展纲要草案对于缺乏和丧失劳动力的社员提出了“五保”的办法以后，解除了缺乏和丧失劳动力的社员的顾虑，他们也积极赞成取消土地报酬，实现土地公有化。还有人问，为什么高级合作社实行土地集体所有，而不实行土地国有？这是因为，土地归合作社集体所有，容易为广大农民所接受，也同样可以保障社会主义经济建设的正常进行；如果实行土地国有，反而可能引起农民的误解。
    在高级合作化以后，城市居民在农村中占有的土地如何处理，这是有些人所关心的问题。高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案第十五条规定：“从事城市的职业、全家居住在城市的人们，属于他们所有的在农村中的土地，可以交给合作社使用。如果本主生活有困难，历来依靠土地作为一部分生活补助，合作社应该给以照顾，付给一定的报酬。如果以后本主愿意移居乡村，从事农业生产，合作社应该吸收他入社，或者把原有的土地交还他使用。”这样的规定，既照顾了农民的土地已经实行集体所有制的情况，又照顾了一部分在农村中有土地而住在城市的人们的生活困难；既把这些土地交给合作社使用，有利于发展生产，又保留了这些人的土地所有权。所以这项规定是合情合理的。
    对于林木入社的问题，章程草案第十八条明确地规定了，少量的零星的树木不入社，仍然归社员私有；大量的成片的林木入社的时候，可以作价转为合作社集体所有，价款由合作社从林木收益中分期付还；在合作社刚成立的时候，也可以不归社公有而采取统一经营、林木和劳动比例分红的过渡办法。这样规定的目的，就是为了保护森林不遭破坏。
    第二，关于对富农的改造问题。
    去年公布的供初级合作社采用的示范章程，对于过去的地主分子和富农分子入社，做了比较严格的规定。这在当时是完全必要的。
    由于农村中社会主义革命高潮的发展，富裕中农也已经随着贫农和下中农参加了农业生产合作社，富农阶级迅速地最后地被完全孤立起来了。社会主义合作化的潮流是抗拒不了的。过去的地主分子和富农分子也已经认识到这一点。同时，由于基本实现了农业合作化，由于供销合作、信用合作和粮食、棉花的统购统销等社会主义措施在农村中的推行，这就使富农不得不放弃剥削。同时，他们又在社会主义建设和社会主义改造过程中受到了很大的教育，逐渐认识到加入合作社比不入社有利。这些政治上和经济上的因素，就在过去的地主分子和富农分子中引起了明显的分化。虽然仍有一小部分人继续抵抗和破坏合作化运动，另有一部分人处于动摇观望的状态，但是大部分人已经表示接受改造。因此，在一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要（草案）中，针对着过去的地主分子和已经放弃剥削的富农分子已经发生分化的情况，采取了分别对待的方法，把他们放在合作社里面来进行改造。高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案第八条关于过去的地主富农分子入社问题的规定，同全国农业发展纲要的规定是一致的。
    过去的地主分子，经过土地改革，一般在经济上早已下降了。而过去的富农分子，有的经过土地改革也早已下降了，有的在土地改革以后仍然保持富农的经济地位，另外在土地改革以后还产生了很少数的新富农，他们占有的生产资料是较多的。那么，在他们入社的时候，对他们所占有的生产资料怎样处理呢？高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案第二十一条规定，已经放弃剥削的富农分子参加合作社的时候，入社的全部生产资料的价款，除抵交应摊的一份股份基金和补交一份公积金、公益金以外，其余的部分作为多交的股份基金。对待富农的财产为什么采取这种办法呢？因为，我国的富农是带半封建性的，他们在农村中历来是和地主有着千丝万缕的联系；他们对农民有不同程度的剥削，政治上也不是站在农民一边的；同时，我国的富农在经济上是很小的，生产经营也同样是落后的，对于国民经济也没有什么贡献。因此，对待富农的财产采取这样的办法是比较适当的。
    第三，关于烈属、军属和复员军人入社的问题。
    烈士和革命军人是革命的功臣，是祖国和人民的保卫者，应该受到人民的尊敬。他们的家属往往因为缺乏劳动力而有一定的困难，应该受到国家的抚恤和优待。同时，农业生产合作社也应该积极吸收烈属、军属入社，并且给以适当的照顾。
    人民解放军的复员军人，在部队中经过长期的锻炼，他们的政治水平和文化水平一般是比较高的。农业生产合作社应该热情地欢迎复员军人入社，并且应该使他们在合作社中和其他先进分子一起共同发挥应有的带头作用。在这一方面，实际上一般也是做得好的。
    复员军人中，还有一种人，他们是在解放战争中起义的人员，和平解放的人员，后来复员回乡生产的。对于这种人，只要他们愿意参加农业生产合作社，从事农业劳动，也应该吸收他们入社。因为，如果他们本来是劳动人民出身的，自然应该吸收他们入社。如果他们是地主富农出身的，过去的地主分子和已经放弃剥削的富农分子也可以按照不同情况，分别吸收入社，他们既然是起义的人员，应该比一般的地主分子和富农分子更具有入社的条件。如果他们过去在地方上曾经有过罪恶行为，那也应该把他们的起义看做是悔过和立功的表现，经过乡人民委员会的审查批准的手续，而允许他们入社。当然，这后一种人，在农村中是容易引起纠纷的。一方面，应该教育农民群众，照顾这种人起义有功，而对他们的历史行为采取宽大态度，不咎既往；另一方面，也要教育这种人向群众承认自己的错误，以取得群众的谅解。
    第四，关于妇女社员的特殊利益问题。
    高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案第二条、第三十三条、第四十四条、第四十九条、第五十条、第五十六条和第六十条，对于妇女社员的特殊利益作了相应的规定。现在有些农业生产合作社对这一方面照顾不够，把“重视妇女劳动”变成“重使妇女劳动”，以致有些女社员劳动过度，影响健康，合作社的干部中妇女的比例太小，甚至没有，有的合作社的正副主任中连一个女的也没有。这些缺点，都应该迅速纠正。
    合作社管理委员会、生产队长、生产组长，在分配社员劳动任务的时候，必须切实注意女社员的生理特点和体力；照顾女社员从事家务劳动的实际需要；同时，也要向女社员解释清楚，劝她们不要因为争工分或者争面子而勉强担负自己体力所不能胜任的劳动，以免累出病来。
    农业生产合作社，应该举办女社员所特殊需要的福利设施，例如农忙托儿组织等等；但是，必须根据公益金的多少量力举办，只能随着生产的发展、公益金的增加而逐渐举办。因为，农业生产合作社同工厂不同，农业合作社社员同工人不同。工人除了拿工资以外，他所生产出来的产品是全部交给国家的。农业生产合作社社员所生产出来的产品是分给社员个人的，合作社只留下很少的公积金和公益金。因此，要求合作社为女社员所举办的福利设施超过合作社公益金所能负担的限度，那是不合理的，也是不可能的。当然，农业生产合作社如果不注意妇女的特殊利益，有力量举办一些福利设施而不举办，那也是不对的。
    第五，正确地处理合作社社员个人同集体的关系。
    高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案，明确地、具体地规定了合作社的集体利益必须同社员的个人利益正确地结合起来。它规定了分配给每户社员的菜地；零星树木、小农具和家庭副业所需要的副业工具不入社；允许社员经营家庭副业；社员按计划在社内做够了一定的劳动日以后，其余的劳动时间完全由社员自由支配；并且规定农业生产合作社应该根据既使社员的个人收入逐年有所增加、而又增加合作社的公共积累的原则，进行分配；如果合作社生产增加不很多，为了增加社员的个人收入，公积金还可以少留。这些规定，都是很必要的，保证了社员的个人利益同集体利益的正确结合，这一定会大大提高社员群众对集体的关心，也大大有利于农业生产的发展。
    国家利益、集体利益、长远利益同局部利益、个人利益、目前利益，根本讲来当然是一致的，但是在一定程度上，又是有矛盾的。一般社员个人所最关心的问题就是入社以后，能够增加自己的个人收入，他首先因为这样才赞成社会主义。而合作社的干部总想把合作社办得神气些，多积累些公共财产。但是，公共积累搞多了，社员的个人收入就会减少，这就有了矛盾。当前的主要问题，正是在社会主义革命的高潮之下，过分强调了集体利益，忽视了个人利益。这对农业生产的发展和合作社的巩固都是不利的。因此，就有必要提醒这些干部重视个人利益。当然，如果片面强调社员的个人利益，而不顾集体利益和国家利益，那也是不对的，对社员也是不利的。
    第六，加强合作社民主管理，反对强迫命令和官僚主义。
    基本实现了农业合作化，一万万户的农民组织起来了，组织成一百多万个合作社。在合作社内，有管理委员会、生产队、生产小组等层层的组织。这当然是管理集体生产所必需的，好处是很多的。但是，这也带来了不好的一个方面，那就是容易产生强迫命令和官僚主义。因此，在高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案第一章（总则）、第八章（政治工作）和第十章（管理机构）中，把民主管理做为合作社的总则，把反对强迫命令和官僚主义做为合作社政治工作的一项重要内容，并且在组织方面做了相应的规定。着重发扬社员大会的作用，加大社员大会的权力，许多重大问题还要有出席社员三分之二的多数才能通过；如果限于客观的实际困难，不能召开社员大会，而由社员代表大会代行社员大会职权的时候，章程草案第五十六条又规定了代表人数不能太少，代表由生产单位选举，并且在会前和会后都要召开生产队的全体会议或者按地区分片召开社员会议，征求大家意见和传达社员代表大会的决议。这些规定，都是为了使合作社的管理工作具有更多的民主，使合作社干部发扬群众路线的优良作风，为办好合作社建立必要的组织保证。
    第七，关于合作社内的民族团结问题。
    我国是一个多民族的国家，许多地方的农业生产合作社常常碰到民族问题。不仅在少数民族聚居的地区和民族杂居的地区有这个问题，就是在内地也常常碰到这个问题。因此，高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案第四十七条和第六十条做了相应的规定。现在，有少数农业生产合作社在这一方面是有缺点的，在社会主义革命的热情下，过分地追求集体，追求统一，而不注意尊重民族的风俗习惯，在合作社的领导成分中不注意吸收在社员中占的比例较小的民族的代表参加，这是应该纠正的。内蒙古自治区有些蒙民和汉民的联合社，他们在集体经营以后，因为照顾了民族特点，发挥了各民族的特长，从而发展了生产，并且解决了多年不能解决的农牧业的矛盾。这种经验，是值得大家学习的。
    此外，关于勤俭办社、按劳取酬等等问题，在高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案中都有明确具体的规定，在这里不多做说明了。
    这个说明是否妥当，请各位代表指正。
