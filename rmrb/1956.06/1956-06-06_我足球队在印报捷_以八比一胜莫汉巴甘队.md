    我足球队在印报捷
    以八比一胜莫汉巴甘队
    据新华社新德里电　中国足球队六月四日在加尔各答同印度莫汉巴甘足球队举行友谊比赛，结果中国队以八比一获胜。
    莫汉巴甘队是印度著名的足球队，曾获加尔各答第一组足球联赛冠军。在今年三月间访问香港时，曾以六比二胜港联队，以五比一胜港选队。
    在这场有四万观众的比赛开始以前，由于倾盆大雨场地很湿。但是尽管天气不好，所有的票都卖光了。观众中约有两千名华侨，他们怀着对从他们祖国来的足球队的热烈仰慕的心情来观看比赛。
    中国队在前半场以四比零领先。在下半场，中国队采取高速战略，又攻进了四球。
    莫汉巴甘队的一球是它的队长萨塔尔以长距离射击的办法攻进的。莫汉巴甘队有几次逼近中国球门，但是没有能够突破守门员这一关。
    比赛在极友好的气氛中进行。
