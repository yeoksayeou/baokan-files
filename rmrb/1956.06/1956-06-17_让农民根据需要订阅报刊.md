    Allow Peasants to Subscribe to Newspapers and Magazines Based on Need

    To the Editors:

    In the office and the homes of members of the Unity Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fenglou Township, Jiji District, Cao County, Shandong Province, there are piles of newspapers and magazines that no one has read. Some women use the brand-new magazines as folders for shoe patterns and embroidery thread. It turns out that this cooperative subscribes to nine types of newspapers and magazines, averaging 150 copies per month for each production team. However, out of the 1,340 members of the cooperative, only 22 have a higher elementary school education, and some magazines and newspapers are simply incomprehensible to them.

    Why does this cooperative subscribe to so many newspapers and magazines? This is because the staff of the Cao County Post Office one-sidedly pursued circulation figures and adopted the practice of forced distribution. For example, when post office worker Sun Chaogang saw that the number of newspaper and magazine subscriptions in this cooperative did not "satisfy" him, he unreasonably criticized the cooperative cadres, saying: "You are being influenced by right-leaning conservative thinking and cannot see the development of the new situation and new things! Other small cooperatives have subscribed to many newspapers and magazines. You are an advanced cooperative and a key point cooperative. How can you be worthy if you don't subscribe to more newspapers and magazines? Moreover, your cooperative is the focus of our distribution!" In this way, the cooperative cadres were forced to subscribe to newspapers and magazines according to his wishes. Later, after learning the principle of running the cooperative frugally, the cooperative cadres decided to reduce unnecessary newspapers and magazines, but Sun Chaogang firmly said: "You can only subscribe to more, not less!" Sun Chaogang used this method every time to complete the distribution task and was praised by the county bureau every time.

    Such things do not only happen in the Unity Cooperative, but also in the Democracy Cooperative and the Jianhua Cooperative. We suggest that the Cao County Post Office conduct a thorough inspection and immediately correct the phenomenon of forced distribution in the newspaper and magazine distribution work.

### 让农民根据需要订阅报刊

    让农民根据需要订阅报刊编辑同志：
    山东省曹县季集区丰娄乡团结农业生产合作社的办公室里和社员的家里，堆着很多没人看过的报纸和刊物。有些妇女把崭新的杂志当做放鞋样和花线的夹子。原来，这个社共订有九种报刊，平均每个生产队每个月能够得到一百五十份。但是全社一千三百四十个社员中，只有二十二个具有高小的文化程度，有些杂志和报纸根本无人能看懂。
    这个社为什么要订这么多的报刊呢？这是因为曹县邮局的工作人员片面地追求发行数字，采取了强迫摊派的做法。比如，邮局工作人员孙朝刚在见到这个社订阅报刊的种数不能使他“满意”的时候，就无理地批评社干部说：“你们是右倾保守思想在做怪，看不见新形势新事物的发展！别的小社都订了很多报刊，你们是高级社，又是基点社，不多订几份报刊，怎么能相称呢？况且你社又是我们发行的重点！”这样，逼得这个社的干部只好按着他的意见来订阅报刊。后来社干部学了勤俭办社的方针，决定减去不必要的报刊，但是孙朝刚却强硬地说：“你们只能多订，不能少订！”孙朝刚每次都用这样的办法完成了发行任务，并且每次都受到县局的表扬。
    这样的事情，不只是发生在团结社一个社，在民主社、建华社也有。建议曹县邮局进行深入检查，并且立即纠正报刊发行工作中的强迫摊派现象。
