The Current International Situation

Fellow Representatives:

Nearly a year has passed since the Second Session of the First National People’s Congress. During this period, thanks to the continuous efforts of peace-loving countries and people, the international situation has definitely moved towards relaxation, and the Cold War policy has become increasingly unpopular.

In the past year, countries have made great progress in enhancing mutual understanding through mutual contact. Although the United States is unwilling to abandon its Cold War policy, the vast majority of countries believe that peaceful coexistence is not only necessary but also possible. More and more countries are opposing hostile military blocs and adhering to a policy of peace and neutrality. The movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for independence and freedom have reached a new upsurge. Asian and African countries are playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. The movements of people all over the world against war and for the maintenance of peace have increasingly become an important factor affecting the development of the international situation. Even in countries participating in military blocs led by the United States, there are increasingly obvious signs of a desire to break away from U.S. control and embark upon a path of neutrality.

In the process of striving for the relaxation of international tensions, the socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have made many effective efforts. To make the cause of peace more guaranteed, our socialist countries are constantly strengthening their unity and cooperation with each other. Here, it should be particularly mentioned that the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, through mutual visits and talks between the leaders of the two countries, have restored and strengthened the friendly relations between the two countries. This is of great significance not only for the entire socialist cause but also for the cause of peace.

The Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference opened up a broad road for relaxing international tensions. However, due to the United States' insistence on a rigid Cold War stance, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and the Disarmament Conference failed to make the due further contributions. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, in the spirit of Geneva, are actively implementing the policy of relaxing international tensions and strengthening world peace. In order to break the deadlock on the disarmament issue, the Soviet Union accepted the proposals of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States on disarmament in two stages and on the maximum limits of armed forces; after the Western countries retreated from their own disarmament proposals, the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies took the initiative to reduce their armed forces and military expenditures to promote disarmament in other countries. The Soviet Union has also made unremitting efforts to improve relations with the three major powers, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. The recent talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France have not only proved that the positions of the great powers on many outstanding international issues can be brought closer, but also showed the broad prospects for improving relations between countries, especially great powers, in the economic and cultural fields. The influence of these talks is still expanding. The several letters from Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to U.S. President Eisenhower, proposing that the Soviet Union and the United States sign a treaty of friendship and cooperation and presenting new initiatives on the disarmament issue, although they did not receive due response from the U.S. government, have had a great impact on the American people and internationally. As far as China is concerned, China has also made continuous efforts to relax international tensions and promote peaceful coexistence among countries. In the spirit of Bandung, China has launched extensive international contacts in all aspects, and has promoted and improved relations with many countries, especially Asian and African countries. China's efforts to continue to ease and eliminate tensions in Indochina, Korea, and the Taiwan region are also known to everyone.

Many countries in the world that do not participate in military blocs, especially countries in Asia and Africa, actively participate in international affairs and greatly strengthen the forces for international peace. These countries adhere to a policy of peace and neutrality and safeguard their national sovereignty. They hope to build their own independent national economies and therefore urgently require a peaceful international environment. They advocate peaceful coexistence and economic cooperation among countries, oppose so-called economic aid with conditions, and oppose being dragged into the whirlpool of arms expansion. As more and more countries implement this policy, the area of peace is expanding not only in Asia and Africa, but also in Europe and other regions. The proposition of collective peace that does not exclude any country to replace hostile military blocs is becoming increasingly realistic. India, as a world power, is playing a particularly significant role in actively advocating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and expanding the influence of the area of peace. On March 20, 1956, Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in a statement on foreign policy in the Indian People's Chamber: "We believe, and with each new experience we further affirm our confidence, that only by observing and implementing the Five Principles, now known as Panchsheel, can a new era of international peace and stability be hoped for." This just stand has been praised and supported by all peace-loving countries and people, and it cannot but affect some countries participating in military blocs led by the United States.

In the process of opposing the Cold War and striving for the relaxation of the international situation, we should especially mention the great role played by the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for independence and freedom. U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, once said that "colonialism is the root cause of the disease that endangers the cause of peace." The victory of anti-colonialism and the establishment and development of new nationally independent countries not only realize the national aspirations of the people of these countries, but also will inevitably have a major impact on the cause of maintaining world peace. Countries that have mastered their own destiny and gotten rid of colonial rule are determined not to allow themselves to be enslaved by colonialism again. Indonesian President Sukarno said during his visit to the United States in May 1956, "We would rather work with our hands in our country's land and jungles than exchange any part of our freedom for any assistance." He also pointed out that colonialism is "the basic root cause of world instability." Egyptian President Nasser also said on May 19, 1956, "We will not allow any country or group of countries to plan our policies, or consider us as a sphere of influence, or order us to carry out their policies." This is precisely the firm position of the people of Asia, Africa, and other regions in striving for and safeguarding their national independence.

After Bandung Conference, the struggle of the Asian and African people against colonialism has further developed, and made great achievements. Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia have gained independence after a long struggle. We congratulate the birth of these new countries, and willing to establish friendly relations with them. We warmly congratulate Egypt for having made foreign troops withdraw from its territory, and believe that this withdrawal is also wise for the withdrawing countries. We firmly support the just struggles of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian, the Indian people to recover Goa, the Arab people to strive for and safeguard their national rights, and the people of all Asian, African and other regions countries to oppose colonialism, and firmly believe that their struggles are bound to win.

Now, in North Africa, the Algerian people are still being forced to wage armed resistance. The Chinese people support the just struggle of the Algerian people, and at the same time, cannot but deeply concern about the tense situation in Algeria. Not long ago, Indian Prime Minister Nehru proposed a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue, advocating peaceful negotiations and the restoration of peace in Algeria on the basis of fully recognizing the national aspirations of the Algerian people. This proposal is in line with the spirit of the Bandung Conference's resolution on the Algerian issue.

As far as Western countries are concerned, years of Cold War policies have brought increasingly heavy military expenditure burdens to the people of the countries concerned. Moreover, the policy of strength advocated by the United States first harms the national interests of its allied countries. It is precisely for this reason that the people of these countries have actively launched struggles to maintain peace and demand peaceful coexistence among countries. Even the governments of the major European countries participating in the Western military blocs are increasingly aware that blindly following the United States' Cold War and strength policies will not bring any benefits to themselves, but will only squeeze their own economic interests and damage their own independence and sovereignty. Recently, British and French politicians have stated that: except for madmen, no one can plan to conquer the world by force anymore; the time has come to end the Cold War, increase exchanges between East and West, and develop human contact to promote mutual understanding; Western countries should not miss any opportunity to ease tensions. These statements are welcome.

However, it should also be pointed out that these major European countries participating in Western military blocs have not adopted a far-sighted attitude towards the expansion of peaceful areas and the development of national independence movements. They are still hesitating at the crossroads of recognizing the right to national self-determination of the people of dependent countries and respecting the political and economic independence of these countries, or continuing violent suppression and continuing economic enslavement. However, the trend of historical development is very clear. In an era when the people of the vast Asia and Africa have awakened, they can only hope to retain certain legitimate interests in the relevant regions due to long-term historical connections if they recognize the right to national self-determination of the people of dependent countries, in a situation where it is recognized by the local people and beneficial to both parties; they can only develop new, equal, and mutually beneficial political and economic relations with these countries if they respect the political and economic independence of these countries.

The vast majority of countries and people in the world hope for peaceful coexistence, and only some people in the United States and their followers insist on the Cold War. Moreover, it is worth pointing out that even among the U.S. ruling groups, some more sober-minded people are beginning to realize that the Cold War and the policy of strength have no way out. They cannot fail to see that this policy has been opposed by the broad masses of the people and has aroused increasing dissatisfaction among the allied countries of the United States. They cannot but admit that the U.S. foreign policy based on the Cold War and the policy of strength must be changed. This new understanding is welcome. However, some people in the U.S. ruling group who occupy powerful positions, especially those who actually control foreign policy, are still hindering this change. They are unwilling to see the relaxation of tensions, and unwilling to see countries coexist peacefully. What they are concerned about is only the highest profits of U.S. monopoly capital, and they still attempt to impose their own will on other countries through this policy of war blackmail. Therefore, although some U.S. leaders, including President Eisenhower, have stated that in our era, war has become an anachronism, in fact, the United States is still using various pressures to prevent its allied countries from reducing armaments, and through military blocs, it attempts to further control these countries politically. Although some U.S. leaders have stated that neutral countries that do not participate in military blocs should be respected, other leaders have described the policy of not participating in military blocs as outdated, short-sighted, and even immoral. Moreover, in actual actions, the United States is still exerting various crude pressures on many countries that refuse to participate in military blocs. Some U.S. leaders also verbally admit that the desire for national independence of the people of other countries should be respected, but in practice, they support and instigate colonial countries to suppress anti-colonial movements through the organization of military blocs, attempting to profit from it. Some U.S. leaders have also expressed that mutual suspicion, fear, and hatred in the world should be eliminated, but the U.S. government is unwilling to support broad cultural exchanges and people-to-people exchanges between East and West, and deliberately insists on first resolving certain international disputes that are difficult to resolve at present, as a prerequisite for easing international tensions, attempting to block international contact and international consultation. Under the insistence of its allies, the United States has had to express that it is considering providing the necessary conditions for strengthening international economic cooperation and expanding trade between East and West, but it does not abandon the so-called economic aid to continue to enslave and exploit many countries, and refuses to take any practical action to lift the embargo. On the one hand, the United States expresses respect for the right of the people of all countries to choose their own political system, and on the other hand, it clamors to "liberate" the European People's Democracies, and like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, it dares not face the existence of the People's Republic of China. All of this shows that the U.S. ruling group is in a deep contradiction between wanting both peace and war; and until now, those who advocate continuing the Cold War still occupy a dominant position.

Precisely because of this, the United States is still creating tension in the Far East by means of threats. In Vietnam, the United States openly supports the Ngo Dinh Diem group in South Vietnam, undermining the Geneva Accords regarding consultations on nationwide elections in Vietnam, and hindering the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. In Korea, the United States not only rejects the proposal of the Chinese and Korean governments to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea, but also, despite the repeated efforts made by the Chinese and Korean sides to maintain the Korean Armistice Agreement, unilaterally announces that it will no longer abide by the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the exercise of powers by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea. The United States also openly stated that it would maintain its strength and exercise the so-called right of self-defense in Taiwan, Chinese territory, and refused to conduct serious negotiations on the issue of peacefully resolving tensions in the Taiwan region.

However, in today's world where the international situation is definitely trending towards relaxation and the broad masses of the people demand peaceful coexistence among countries, the policy of creating tensions and conducting war blackmail cannot succeed.

If the United States continues to pursue the Cold War and the policy of strength, it will not only be condemned by peace-loving countries and people around the world, but it will also inevitably lead to the further development of the centrifugal tendency of its allies, making itself more isolated. Taking the situation in the Far East as an example, the United States believes that by arming South Korea, it can threaten the Korean and Chinese sides, but the facts show that the Korean and Chinese sides cannot be intimidated. The result of carrying out this war blackmail can only make the United States itself be continuously blackmailed by the Syngman Rhee group. At the same time, we should point out that if some people in the United States even think that it can launch a sudden incident in the Far East, it can be asserted that this will not bring it any benefits. The Chinese people have full confidence and strength to defend their fruits of victory and defeat armed intervention from any direction.

Our Foreign Policy

The consistent direction of the Chinese government's efforts in international affairs is to maintain world peace, strengthen and develop our country's unity and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and promote and develop our country's extensive political, economic, and cultural ties with other countries in accordance with the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. For those countries that have already established diplomatic relations with China, we strive to develop and consolidate our friendly relations with them. For those countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations with China, we do not give up opportunities to increase contact with them and improve relations. Over the past few years, our efforts have been fruitful.

We believe that the increasingly frequent contacts between countries are a sign of the relaxation of international tensions in recent years, and at the same time, an important factor in promoting the development of this trend.

Contact between leaders of countries with different social systems is a very important step in strengthening understanding, trust, and relaxing international tensions between countries. This has been fully proven in China's contacts with many countries. We all clearly remember that an important milestone in the development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and India, China and Burma, and China and Indonesia was the mutual visits and joint statements issued by the leaders of both sides. The Asian-African Conference provided a very valuable opportunity for our leaders to conduct extensive contact with the leaders of many Asian and African countries. The pleasant contact during that conference between the premiers of China and Egypt led to the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries a year later. China and Afghanistan and Nepal also further developed their pre-existing friendly relations through contact between the leaders of both sides at that conference. The frank conversation between the premiers of China and Pakistan during that conference also played a role in increasing mutual under standing and improving relations between the two countries. China attaches great importance to contact between the leaders of countries, and in the future, we are prepared to conduct this contact more extensively.

The absence of diplomatic relations between countries does not prevent them from conducting government-to-government contact. China and Ceylon have not yet established diplomatic relations, but as early as 1952, the Chinese and Ceylonese governments signed a trade agreement, and have renewed the trade agreement every year up to now. Recently, the Ceylonese government expressed its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with China. We welcome this expression and suggest that the two countries exchange diplomatic envoys. Before China and Egypt formally established diplomatic relations, responsible personnel from the government departments of the two countries also visited each other, and the two governments also signed cultural and trade agreements. We have also conducted government-to-government contact with Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan, and have achieved satisfactory results. The most notable is the visit to China by Cambodian Prince Sihanouk at the invitation of the Chinese government. During his visit, the leaders of China and Cambodia extensively exchanged views, and the Chinese government fully understood and supported the position of peace and neutrality of the Kingdom of Cambodia. As a result, in our view, the peaceful neutral status of Cambodia has not been weakened, but strengthened. We hope and are striving to establish the same friendly relations with Laos.

However, on the other hand, we cannot but point out that when we take the initiative to try to conduct official contact with some countries that have not established diplomatic relations, it is not always completely smooth.

The Chinese government has suggested to the Japanese government more than once that the two governments should hold talks on promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. Recently, the Japanese government has taken a more active attitude in developing Sino-Japanese trade, but in general, it has not responded to China's initiative with practical actions. Due to the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people and the current situation in Japan, even though the state of war between China and Japan has not ended, the Chinese government now still actively handles Japanese war criminals who have been detained and examined for a long time in accordance with a lenient policy, and will no longer prosecute the vast majority of them, and are sending them back to their country in batches, and leniently sentences a very small number of them whose crimes are serious, and decides that if they perform well during their imprisonment, they can be released early. The Chinese government's handling of these war criminals is completely consistent with the spirit we have expressed to Japanese friends who have visited China in the past. The Chinese government has made these continuous efforts because we have correctly estimated the strong desire of the people of China and Japan to coexist peacefully and have friendly exchanges, and to restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible.

In the past few years, more and more people from China and Japan have visited each other, and the scope of contact has become wider and wider. In 1955, a total of more than 800 Japanese friends visited China, accounting for the first place in the number of foreign guests visiting China last year. Despite various difficulties, the number of people from various Chinese people's organizations who were invited to visit Japan has also increased, with about 100 people last year alone. It is especially worth noting that Chinese and Japanese people's organizations have directly handled certain issues related to common interests through consultation. From 1952 to the present, a total of fifteen agreements or joint communiqués have been signed between Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations. These agreements and joint communiqués involve trade, fishery, overseas Chinese, and friendly cooperation in many aspects, and the implementation is encouraging. This frequent and effective contact between the people of China and Japan is warmly welcomed and supported by the Chinese government, and it cannot but have an increasingly significant impact on the Japanese government.

In the aspect of China's development of friendly relations with other countries, the contact between the Chinese people and the people of other countries occupies an important position. In 1955, we received more than 4,000 foreign guests from more than 60 countries, an increase of more than 60% compared with 1954. These more than 4,000 foreign guests represented various aspects such as parliament, political parties, economy, culture, art, trade unions, youth, women, science, education, health, religion, sports, and news. On the other hand, our country also sent more than 3,000 representatives to more than 30 countries last year to conduct friendly visits and strengthen economic ties and cultural exchange activities. This year, the number of people we receive and send will continue to increase.

It is particularly worth pointing out that in the contact between the people of various countries, mutual visits between parliamentary delegations or parliamentarians of various countries have become an increasingly important form. We have received a delegation from the Japanese parliament. During their visit, important joint communiqués were also issued between the parliamentary organizations of China and Japan. During our meeting, a Finnish parliamentary delegation was invited to visit our country, and today they addressed our meeting, making us feel very honored. Their visit to China has opened up a new channel for friendly exchanges between our country and Finland and other Nordic countries. Not long ago, members of the Brazilian parliament also visited our country and attended our meeting. This is a new development in the friendly contact between our people and the people of Latin American countries. Last year, we also received French members of parliament, which played an important role in expanding our ties with Western European countries.

The Chinese people very much hope to restore the contact that was once interrupted with countries near us and historically connected to us, such as Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore. We have long expressed this wish and made efforts for this purpose. We are pleased to note that Thai leaders have expressed their willingness to improve Sino-Thai relations, and in the Philippines, more and more people advocate restoring contact with China starting with trade. We also welcome Mr. Marshall, chairman of the Singapore Labor Front, to visit China at our invitation.

The scale of contact that China has already had with many countries and the greater efforts that we are prepared to make in the future fully demonstrate that we advocate the free exchange of people from all countries. However, countries must be able to come and go to better help eliminate doubts and increase mutual trust.

China is an emerging country. We know that an emerging country, especially a large country, often cannot be fully understood by others in a short period of time, and often causes some doubts. If some parties add ulterior motives to spread rumors and stir up trouble, this lack of understanding and doubt may deepen. However, rumors and provocations cannot stand the test of facts, and lack of understanding and doubt can also be eliminated through a longer period of observation and practical contact. Based on this belief, we have always welcomed people from all walks of life from all over the world to visit China, and we have tried our best to meet their requirements during their visits. We do not exaggerate our achievements to them, nor do we conceal our shortcomings from them. We hope that they can see from the actual process of the Chinese people moving from backwardness to progress, the direction of the Chinese people in peaceful construction and the Chinese people's urgent desire for peace. What they are expecting, is not praise, but mutual understanding and trust. We also sincerely hope that they will unreservedly point out our shortcomings so that our work can be improved. Among those who originally doubted us, some may continue to retain their doubts. This will not disappoint us. We believe that continued observation and contact will gradually increase their understanding of us. Of course, it is welcome if those who originally held prejudices or were hostile to us change their attitude; if they continue to maintain their original attitude, it will not cause us any loss.

China's expanding contact with other countries stems from our willingness to coexist peacefully with all countries, including the United States, without excluding any country. We oppose building our friendly relations with some countries on the basis of excluding other countries. Even for the United States, we have the same desire to be friendly with it. We believe that the outstanding disputes between China and the United States should not be an obstacle to the friendly exchanges between the people of China and the United States. And we are convinced that the traditional friendship between the people of China and the United States will one day make the people of the two countries re-establish contact with each other through their respective governments.

Facts speak louder than words. The iron curtain or bamboo curtain is not here with us. It is not we who hinder the contact between the people of various countries by means of political conditions or personality-insulting methods such as fingerprinting. We do not need this kind of restriction. These kinds of restrictions cannot last long. The desire of the people of all countries for free exchanges and friendly contact cannot be stopped by any force.

An important aspect of relaxing international tensions and promoting peaceful coexistence among countries is to develop trade and economic cooperation among countries. Although, on a global scale, the situation of international trade and economic cooperation is far from normal, we see that more and more countries have developed economic relations with each other according to the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty. On the one hand, the practice of conducting enslavement and exploitation in the name of economic assistance and setting up various artificial obstacles in international economic relations has been met with increasingly strong opposition.

Equality and mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty, are not only the principles adhered to by socialist countries in their economic cooperation with each other and with other countries, but also the principles established by the Asian-African Conference's resolution on economic cooperation. According to this principle, a new type of economic relationship has been established between socialist countries. The Soviet Union's friendly assistance to China in economic and technical terms is a great example of this relationship. The economic cooperation developed by the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries with many Asian and African countries according to this principle also shows unprecedented characteristics in history. Taking China as an example, whether it is economic cooperation through trade channels, as we do with many Asian and African countries, or economic cooperation through gratuitous assistance, as we do with Cambodia, our purpose is to promote each other's economic development. We have no surplus materials that need to be dumped. We have no economic crisis that needs to be transferred. We do not engage in interference and control of other countries in the name of economic cooperation, or impose military, political, and economically unfavorable obligations on other countries.

China is a country that has just been liberated not long ago. Our economy is still very backward, and we are not yet completely independent economically. Therefore, our economic strength is limited, and we mainly engage in economic cooperation with other countries through trade. However, since we recognize that economic independence is of great significance for consolidating political independence, we are willing to contribute our meager strength within the scope possible, and help the economic development of other countries while carrying out our own economic construction. We do not object to Western countries providing assistance to countries that are not yet economically developed, but we cannot agree to so-called assistance that is conditional on obtaining privileges. If Western countries can also conduct economic cooperation with other countries in accordance with the principles that we abide by, then this will have a very favorable impact not only on the economic development of all countries concerned, but also on the improvement of the overall international situation.

In developing international trade, the principles we adhere to are equality and mutual benefit, and mutual supply of needs. The trade in rice and rubber between China and Ceylon is a new example. We oppose both the trade embargo policy that forcibly cuts off traditional economic ties between countries, and the trade that is only beneficial to one party by means of dumping or other methods.

Facts have proved that it is not the socialist countries that are targeted by the embargo policy that are harmed by the embargo policy, but mainly the countries that are forced to implement this policy. Socialist countries have guaranteed common economic upsurge through self-reliance and mutual support. However, countries forced to implement the embargo policy have found that their markets have shrunk greatly, and domestic economic difficulties have become increasingly serious. Recently, these countries are trying to break through the embargo restrictions, which is understandable and welcome. However, to achieve the effect of breaking through the embargo and developing trade, it is necessary not only to remove various artificial barriers in international trade, but also to effectively prevent the harm to the freedom of navigation of merchant ships of various countries by the Chiang Kai-shek group at the instigation of the United States. In recent years, although China's foreign trade has encountered many external obstacles, it has still increased year by year. The number of countries and regions that trade with China was 47 in 1954, and increased to 62 in 1955. In terms of the trade volume between China and Asian and African countries and Western countries, it increased by 28.2% in 1955 compared with 1954. We believe that once the embargo is lifted, with the vigorous development of domestic construction in China, there will be broad prospects for China to further expand trade with other countries.

Cultural exchanges among the people of various countries, just like economic cooperation, is also an important condition for consolidating peace, friendship, and cooperation among countries. Historically, the people of various countries have always enriched and promoted their own cultures by learning from each other and absorbing each other's advantages. However, now the governments of some countries oppose and prevent their own people from conducting cultural exchanges with the people of countries with different social systems. This can only be interpreted as a manifestation of losing confidence in their own system. For example, our art groups have reached an agreement with American art groups on their mutual visits and performances, which is obviously in line with the wishes of the people of the two countries. However, due to the opposition of the U.S. government, this agreement has not yet been implemented. We believe in the superiority of the socialist system. We also have no doubt that under the socialist system, our country's natural sciences, social sciences, philosophy, and literature and art will be developed most rapidly and extensively. But on the other hand, measured by modern standards, our country is still a culturally backward country. We must recognize that every nation in the world has its strengths. We must not only learn from the strengths of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, but also absorb the strengths of all other countries. This can only accelerate the development of our country's socialist construction, and will not bring us any harm. Therefore, we are not afraid at all, on the contrary, we warmly welcome extensive cultural exchanges with all countries. In fact, conducting cultural exchanges is the common wish of the people of various countries. I only need to mention the grand welcome received by our art groups and the art groups of other countries when they visited each other, which is enough to prove this point. As a way to increase mutual understanding among the people of various countries and promote international cooperation, cultural exchanges have achieved preliminary success, but there is still more work to be done. As far as China is concerned, we will not be stingy with our strength in this regard.

In the past seven years, the Chinese people have made great achievements in peacefully building their own country. Our motherland is gradually transforming from a poor and backward agricultural country into a prosperous and powerful, socialist industrialized country. At the same time, our country's international status has also been unprecedentedly improved. China is playing an increasingly important role in promoting the development of the entire international situation. China's opinions on the resolution of many major international issues have become increasingly impossible to ignore.

Now, 26 countries with more than one billion people have established diplomatic relations with our country. There are more countries and more people maintaining trade and cultural ties with our country. Obviously, it is already impossible for anyone to deny the existence and the growing reality of the People's Republic of China.

True, the United States still attempts to obliterate the right of the Chinese people to choose their own national system, refuses to recognize the People's Republic of China, and tries its best to exclude the new China in international affairs. But, as history has proven, no matter what kind of obstruction, the newborn forces that break through the old system will eventually grow stronger. The American independence revolution against colonial rule was like this, the French bourgeois revolution that overthrew feudal rule was like this, and the Russian October Socialist Revolution that eradicated capitalist rule on one-sixth of the world's land was also like this. Those who do not recognize the new China at present had better review these historical facts.

In fact, although the United States does not recognize the People's Republic of China, the representatives of the U.S. government are still holding talks with the representatives of the Chinese government in Geneva. It is not difficult for people to see from this seemingly contradictory phenomenon that the United States' refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China is actually to use the Chiang Kai-shek group to bargain with China, and to create tension through the Chiang Kai-shek group in order to profit from it.

The United States' attempt to exclude the new China in international affairs has not caused any loss to China. On the contrary , the United States' obstruction of the restoration of the legitimate status and rights of the People's Republic

    周恩来总理兼外交部长关于目前国际形势、我国外交政策和解放台湾问题的发言
    ——1956年6月28日在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上——
                         目前国际形势各位代表：
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议到现在，将近一年了。在这个期间里，由于爱好和平的国家和人民的不断努力，国际局势已经肯定地趋向和缓，冷战政策已经越来越不得人心。
    这一年来，各国之间通过互相的接触，在增进彼此的了解方面，有了很大的进展。虽然美国还不愿意放弃冷战政策，但是绝大多数的国家都相信，和平共处不仅是必要的，而且也是可能的。反对敌对性军事集团、坚持和平中立政策的国家，已经越来越多。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取独立自由的运动有了新的高涨。亚非国家在国际事务中正起着越来越重要的作用。世界各国人民反对战争、维护和平的运动，已经日益成为影响国际局势发展的重要的因素。就是在参加了美国领导的军事集团的国家中，也出现了要求摆脱美国控制、走上中立道路的越来越明显的迹象。
    在争取国际紧张局势和缓的过程中，以苏联为首的社会主义国家，做了很多有成效的努力。为了使和平事业更有保证，我们社会主义国家不断地加强彼此之间的团结和合作。在这里应该特别提到，苏联和南斯拉夫通过两国领导人员之间的互相访问和会谈，恢复和加强了两国间的友好关系。这不仅对于整个社会主义事业，而且也对于和平事业，具有十分重要的意义。
    日内瓦四国政府首脑会议为和缓国际紧张局势开辟了广阔的道路。但是，由于美国坚持冷战的僵硬立场，四国外长会议和裁军会议没有能够进一步作出应有的贡献。尽管如此，苏联和人民民主国家仍然本着“日内瓦精神”，积极地贯彻执行和缓国际紧张局势和加强世界和平的方针。为了打破裁军问题上的僵局，苏联接受了英、法、美三国关于分两个阶段裁军和关于武装部队的最高限额的建议；在西方国家从自己的裁军建议倒退以后，苏联和人民民主国家又主动地裁减自己的武装部队和军费，来推动其他各国的裁军。为了改善同英、法、美三大国的关系，苏联也作了不懈的努力。最近苏英和苏法领导人员之间的会谈，不仅证明了大国在许多悬而未决的国际问题上的立场有可能接近，而且显示了在经济上和文化上改善各国之间特别是大国之间关系的广阔前景。这些会谈的影响还正在扩大。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁同志，为了提出苏联和美国签订友好合作条约的建议和关于裁军问题的新倡议而给美国艾森豪威尔总统的几次信件，虽然没有从美国政府得到应有的反应，但是在美国人民中和在国际上，已经发生了很大的影响。就中国来说，中国对于和缓国际紧张局势和促进各国间的和平共处，也作了不断的努力。本着“万隆精神”，中国从各方面展开了广泛的国际接触，推进和改善同许多国家特别是亚非国家的关系。中国为了继续和缓和消除印度支那、朝鲜和台湾地区的紧张局势所作的努力，也是大家都知道的。
    世界上不参加军事集团的许多国家，特别是亚非地区的国家，积极地参加国际事务，大大地加强了国际和平力量。这些国家坚持和平中立政策，维护自己的国家主权。他们希望建设自己的独立的国民经济，因此迫切地要求有一个和平的国际环境。他们主张各国之间实行和平共处和经济合作，反对有条件的所谓经济援助，反对被拖进扩张军备的漩涡里去。由于越来越多的国家执行这种政策，和平地区不仅在亚非两洲，而且也在欧洲和其他地区日益扩大。以不排斥任何一个国家的集体和平代替敌对性的军事集团的主张，已经越来越具有现实的意义。在积极倡导和平共处五项原则和扩大和平地区的影响方面，作为世界大国的印度起着特别显著的作用。1956年3月20日，印度尼赫鲁总理在印度人民院发表的外交政策声明中说过：“我们认为，而且在每一次有了新经验后我们进一步肯定了我们的信心，只有遵守和实行现在大家都知道的叫做潘查希拉的五项原则，才有希望出现国际和平和安定的新时代。”这一正义立场得到了一切爱好和平的国家和人民的赞扬和支持，同时也不能不影响到参加美国领导的军事集团的一些国家。
    在反对冷战和争取国际形势和缓的过程中，我们应当特别提到亚非地区和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取独立自由的斗争所起的伟大作用。缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努曾经说过，“殖民主义是危害和平事业的疾病的根源。”反殖民主义的胜利和新的民族独立国家的建立和发展，不仅实现了这些国家人民的民族愿望，而且对于维护世界和平的事业，也必然发生重大的影响。已经掌握了自己的命运、摆脱了殖民统治的国家，决不愿意使自己再次受到殖民主义的奴役。印度尼西亚苏加诺总统在1956年5月访问美国的期间说，“我们宁愿以我们的双手在我国的土地上和丛林中从事劳动，而不愿意以我们的自由的任何部分去换取任何援助。”他并且指出殖民主义是“世界不安定的基本根源”。埃及纳赛尔总统在1956年5月19日也说，“我们决不允许任何国家或国家集团来计划我们的政策，或者把我们当作一个势力范围来考虑，或者是命令我们执行他们的政策。”这正是亚非地区和其他地区各国人民争取和维护他们的民族独立的坚决立场。
    在万隆会议以后，亚非人民反对殖民主义的斗争有了进一步的发展，并且取得了重大的成就。苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯经过长期的斗争已经获得了独立。我们庆贺这些新国家的诞生，并且愿意同他们建立友好关系。我们热烈地祝贺埃及已经做到了使外国军队撤出自己的领土，并且认为，这种撤退对于撤兵的国家来说，也是明智的。我们坚决地支持印度尼西亚人民为了收复西伊里安、印度人民为了收复果阿、阿拉伯各国人民为了争取和维护自己的民族权利和一切亚非地区和其他地区各国人民为了反对殖民主义而进行的正义斗争，并且深信他们的斗争是一定能够得到胜利的。
    现在，在北非，阿尔及利亚人民还在被迫地进行武装抵抗。中国人民支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，同时，对于阿尔及利亚的紧张局势，也不能不深切关怀。前不久，印度尼赫鲁总理建议和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，主张在充分承认阿尔及利亚人民民族愿望的基础上，进行和平谈判，恢复阿尔及利亚的和平。这一建议是符合于万隆会议关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议的精神的。
    就西方国家来说，多年来的冷战政策给有关各国人民带来了越来越重的军费负担。并且，美国所倡导的实力政策，首先是使它的同盟国家的民族利益受到危害。正是由于这种原因，这些国家的人民已经积极地展开了维护和平和要求各国和平共处的斗争。就是参加西方军事集团的主要欧洲国家的政府，也日益深刻地认识到，一味追随美国的冷战政策和实力政策，对于他们自己不会带来任何好处，而只是使他们自己的经济利益受到排挤，使自己的独立和主权受到损害。最近，英国和法国的政治家们表示：除了疯子以外，任何人都不能再打算以武力来征服世界；结束冷战、增加东西方的来往和发展人的接触以促进相互谅解的时机已经到来；西方国家不应该错过任何和缓紧张局势的机会。这些表示是值得欢迎的。
    但是，也应该指出，这些参加西方军事集团的主要欧洲国家，对于和平地区的扩大和民族独立运动的发展，还没有采取有远见的态度。他们还徘徊在承认附属国人民的民族自决权利和尊重这些国家的政治、经济独立，或者是继续进行暴力镇压和继续进行经济奴役的十字路口。但是，历史发展的趋势很清楚，在广大亚非地区的人民已经觉醒的时代，他们只有承认附属国人民的民族自决权利，才能指望，在得到当地人民承认并且对双方有利的情况下，保留他们在有关地区由于长期历史联系而产生的某些正当利益；他们也只有尊重这些国家的政治、经济独立，才有可能同这些国家发展新的平等互利的政治、经济关系。
    全世界绝大多数的国家和人民都希望和平共处，只有美国某些人和他们的追随者坚持冷战。而且，值得指出的是，即使在美国统治集团中，一些比较清醒的人也开始认识到，冷战和实力政策是没有出路的。他们不能不看到，这种政策已经遭到广大人民的反对，而且引起了美国的同盟国家的越来越大的不满。他们不能不承认，基于冷战和实力政策的美国外交政策必须有所改变。这种新的认识是值得欢迎的。但是，在美国统治集团中一些占据着强有力地位的人，特别是实际掌握着外交政策的人，仍在阻挠着这种变化。他们不愿意看到紧张局势的和缓，不愿意各国和平共处。他们所关心的只是美国垄断资本的最高利润，他们仍旧企图通过这种战争讹诈政策，把自己的意志强加在其他国家的身上。因此，虽然美国的一些国家领导人员包括艾森豪威尔总统在内，已经表示，在我们的时代里，战争已经成为时代错误，但是，事实上，美国还在使用各种压力，阻止它的同盟国家缩减军备，并且通过军事集团，企图在政治上进一步控制这些国家。虽然美国一部分领导人员表示，应该尊重不参加军事集团的中立国家，但是，另一部分领导人员却又把不参加军事集团的政策说成是陈旧的、近视的、甚至是不道德的。而且，美国在实际行动中，对于许多拒绝参加军事集团的国家，还在施行各种粗暴的压力。美国的某些领导人员，在口头上也承认应该尊重其他国家人民的民族独立的愿望，但是，在实际上却通过军事集团的组织，支持和唆使殖民国家镇压反殖民主义的运动，企图从中取利。美国的某些领导人员也曾表示应该消除世界上的互相猜忌、恐惧和憎恨，但是，美国政府却不愿意支持东西方之间广泛的文化交流和人民来往，而且还故意坚持首先解决某些目前难以解决的国际争端，作为和缓国际紧张局势的先决条件，企图以此杜绝国际接触和国际协商。美国在它的盟国的坚持之下，不得不表示正在考虑为加强国际经济合作和扩大东西方之间的贸易提供必要的条件，但是，却又不放弃以所谓经济援助，来对许多国家继续进行奴役和剥削，并且拒绝采取任何解除禁运的实际行动。美国一方面表示尊重各国人民选择自己政治制度的权利，另一方面却又叫嚣着要“解放”欧洲人民民主国家，并且像把头藏在沙土里的鸵鸟一样，不敢正视中华人民共和国的存在。所有这一切，都表现出美国的统治集团正处于和战两难的深刻的矛盾当中；而且，直到现在为止，主张继续冷战的人仍旧占据着支配的地位。
    正因为如此，美国还在远东用威胁的办法，制造紧张局势。在越南，美国公然支持南越吴庭艳集团，破坏日内瓦协议关于就越南全国选举进行协商的规定，阻挠越南的和平统一。在朝鲜，美国不仅拒绝中朝两国政府关于召开有关国家会议，协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜的建议，而且还不顾中朝方面为了维护朝鲜停战协定所作的一再努力，片面地宣布不再遵守朝鲜停战协定中关于中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜行使职权的条款。美国还公开表示，要在中国的领土台湾保持实力和行使所谓自卫权利，并且拒绝对和平解决台湾地区紧张局势的问题，进行认真的谈判。
    但是，在国际局势肯定趋向和缓、广大人民要求各国和平共处的今天，制造紧张局势、进行战争讹诈的政策是不可能得逞的。
    如果美国继续奉行冷战和实力政策，那么，它不仅将遭到世界爱好和平的国家和人民的谴责，而且将必然导致它的盟国的离心倾向的进一步发展，使它自己更加陷于孤立。就以远东的情况来说，美国以为武装了南朝鲜，就可以对朝中方面进行威胁，但是，事实说明，朝中方面是吓不倒的，进行这种战争讹诈的结果，只能使美国自己受到李承晚集团的不断讹诈。同时，我们应该指出，如果美国有些人竟然认为它还可以在远东发动一次突然事变，那么，可以断言，这决不会替它带来任何好处。中国人民有充分的信心和力量，保卫自己的胜利果实，战胜从任何方面来的武装干涉。我国外交政策
    中国政府在国际事务中一贯努力的方向，就是维护世界和平，加强和发展我国同苏联和人民民主国家的团结互助，并且根据不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则，促进和发展我国同其他国家在政治、经济、文化各方面的广泛联系。对于那些已经同中国建立外交关系的国家，我们竭力发展和巩固同他们的友好关系。对于那些还没有同中国建立外交关系的国家，我们也不放弃机会来同他们增加接触，改善关系。几年来，我们的努力是有成果的。
    我们认为，各国之间日益频繁的接触，是几年来国际紧张局势趋向和缓的标志，同时又是推动这种趋势发展的重要因素。
    不同社会制度国家领导人员之间的接触，是加强各国之间的了解、信任和和缓国际紧张局势的一个十分重要的步骤。这在中国同许多国家的接触中，已经得到了充分的证明。我们都清楚地记得，中印、中缅和中国同印度尼西亚之间发展友好合作关系的一个重要的里程碑，就是双方领导人员的相互访问和联合发表的声明。亚非会议提供了一个非常珍贵的机会，使我国的领导人员能够广泛地同许多亚非国家的领导人员进行接触。中国和埃及两国的总理在那次会议期间的愉快接触，导致了一年以后两国外交关系的正式建立。中国同阿富汗和尼泊尔，也通过双方领导人员在那次会议上的接触，使原来已经存在的友好关系，有了进一步的发展。中国和巴基斯坦两国的总理在那次会议期间的坦率交谈，对于增加两国之间的互相了解和改善彼此的关系，也起了重要的作用。中国十分重视各国领导人员之间的接触，今后我们准备更广泛地进行这种接触。
    国家与国家之间暂时没有外交关系，并不妨碍他们进行政府与政府之间的接触。中国和锡兰还没有建立外交关系，但是早在1952年，中锡两国政府就签订了贸易协定，而且到现在为止，每年都续订了贸易协定。最近，锡兰政府表示愿意同中国建立外交关系，我们欢迎这种表示，并且建议两国互换外交使节。在中国和埃及正式建立外交关系以前，两国政府部门的负责人员也曾经相互访问，而且两国政府还签订了文化和贸易的协定。我们同叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯和苏丹等阿拉伯国家，也同样地进行了政府与政府之间的接触，并且取得了令人满意的结果。最显著的是柬埔寨西哈努克亲王应中国政府的邀请在中国所进行的访问。在他访问期间，中柬两国领导人员广泛地交换了意见，柬埔寨王国的和平中立的立场得到中国政府的充分谅解和支持。结果，照我们看来，柬埔寨的和平中立地位不是削弱了，而是得到了加强。我们希望并且正在努力同老挝建立同样的友好关系。
    但是，另一方面，我们也不能不指出，在我们采取主动，设法同有些没有建交的国家进行官方接触的时候，并不都是完全顺利的。
    中国政府曾经不止一次地向日本政府建议，由两国政府对促进中日关系正常化的问题进行商谈。最近，日本政府在开展中日贸易方面采取了较为积极的态度，但是，在总的方面，还没有以实际行动响应中国的主动。由于中日两国人民友好关系的发展和日本现时的处境，尽管中日两国之间的战争状态还没有结束，中国政府现在仍然主动地按照宽大政策分别处理了经过长期关押和审查的日本战争犯罪分子，对其中的绝大部分人不再起诉，并且正在分批遣送他们回国，对其中罪行严重的极少数人从轻判处，并且决定，如果他们在服刑期间表现良好，还可以提前释放。中国政府对于这些战争犯罪分子的处理，同我们过去对访问中国的日本朋友所表示的精神是完全一致的。中国政府所以作出这些不断的努力，是由于我们正确地估计了中日两国人民要求和平共处和友好来往、要求两国早日恢复正常关系的强烈愿望。
    几年来，中日两国人民之间互相进行访问的人越来越多，接触的范围也越来越广。1955年来中国访问的日本朋友共有八百多人，占去年各国访华外宾人数中的第一位。尽管有种种困难，我国各人民团体应邀访问日本的人数，也有增长，仅以去年来说，就有一百人左右。尤其值得注意的是，中日两国人民团体已经通过协商，直接处理某些有关共同利益的问题。从1952年到现在，中日两国民间团体之间总共签订了十五个协议或联合公报。这些协议和联合公报涉及贸易、渔业、侨民和在许多方面进行友好合作的问题，实施的情况是令人鼓舞的。中日两国人民之间这种频繁的和有成效的接触，受到中国政府的热烈欢迎和支持，而对于日本政府，也不能不发生日益显著的影响。
    在中国同其他国家发展友好关系的方面，中国人民与各国人民之间的接触占有一个重要的地位。1955年，我们接待了来自六十多个国家的四千多位外宾，比1954年多60％以上。这四千多位外宾代表了议会、党派、经济、文化、艺术、工会、青年、妇女、科学、教育、卫生、宗教、体育、新闻等各个方面。另一方面，我国在去年也派出了三千多名代表，到三十多个国家去进行友好访问，并且加强经济联系和文化交流的活动。今年，我们接待的和派出的人数还将继续增加。
    特别值得指出的是，在各国人民的接触中，各国议会代表团或者议员之间的互相访问，已经成为一种越来越重要的形式。我们曾经接待过日本议会代表团。在他们访问的期间，中日两国议会组织之间还发表了重要的联合公报。在我们这次会议期间，芬兰议会代表团应邀来我国访问，今天又向我们的会议致词，使我们感到十分荣幸。他们对中国的访问，为我国同芬兰和其他北欧国家的友好往来开辟了一个新的途径。不久以前，巴西的议员们也曾经来我国访问，并且出席了我们的会议，这是我国人民同拉丁美洲各国人民友好接触的一个新开展。去年，我们还接待过法国的议员们，这对于扩大我们同西欧各国的联系，起了重要的作用。
    中国人民非常希望同那些邻近我们并且同我们有历史联系的国家，像泰国、菲律宾、马来亚、新加坡等，恢复一度中断的接触。我们早就表示了这种愿望，并且为此作出了努力。我们高兴地注意到，泰国的领导人员表示愿意改进中泰关系，在菲律宾，越来越多的人也主张从贸易着手，同中国恢复联系。我们也很欢迎新加坡劳工阵线主席马歇尔先生应邀访华。
    中国同许多国家已经进行接触的规模和我们今后准备作的更大的努力，充分地说明，我们主张各国人民自由来往。但是，各国之间必须要能够有来有往，才能更加有助于消除疑惧，增加互相的信任。
    中国是一个新兴的国家。我们知道，一个新兴的国家，特别是一个大国，往往不能在短时期内得到别人的充分了解，而且还常常引起某些疑惧。如果再加上某些方面别有用心的造谣和挑拨，这种缺乏了解和疑惧的现象还可能加深。但是，造谣和挑拨是经不起事实的考验的，缺乏了解和疑惧也可以经过较长时期的观察和实际的接触来消除。本着这种信念，我们一向欢迎世界各国的各界人士到中国来访问，我们也尽量满足他们在访问中的要求。我们不向他们夸张我们的成就，也不对他们隐讳我们的缺点。我们希望他们能够从中国人民由落后走向进步的实际过程中，看出中国人民进行和平建设的方向和中国人民迫切要求和平的愿望。我们所期望的，不是称赞，而是互相了解和信任。我们也诚恳地希望他们毫无保留地指出我们的缺点，使我们的工作能够得到改进。原来对我们怀疑的人中，可能继续有一部分人保留他们的怀疑。这不会使我们失望。我们相信，继续的观察和接触，会逐渐使他们增加对我们的了解。原来对我们抱有成见或者敌视我们的人，如果改变态度，当然是我们欢迎的；如果继续保持他们原有的态度，对我们也不会造成什么损失。
    中国同其他国家扩大接触，是从我们愿意同一切国家和平共处，包括美国在内，而不排除任何一个国家的立场出发的。我们反对把我们同某些国家的友好关系建筑在排斥另外一些国家的基础之上。就是对于美国，我们也一样具有同它友好的愿望。我们认为，中美两国之间悬而未决的争端，不应该成为阻止中美两国人民友好往来的障碍。而且我们还深信，中美两国人民之间的传统友谊，终有一天会使两国人民重新通过各自的政府互相联系起来。
    事实胜过雄辩。铁幕或者竹幕不在我们这里。用政治条件或者打手印等侮辱人格的办法阻碍各国人民接触的，也不是我们。我们不需要这种限制。这种种限制是不能持久的。各国人民要求自由来往、友好接触的愿望，是没有任何力量可以阻挡得住的。
    和缓国际紧张局势和推动各国和平共处的一个重要的方面，是发展各国之间的贸易和经济合作。虽然，在世界范围内，国际贸易和经济合作的情况，还远不是正常的，但是，我们看到，越来越多的国家已经按照平等互利、互相尊重国家主权的原则发展着彼此的经济关系。而另一方面，以经济援助为名进行奴役和剥削、在国际经济关系中树立各种人为障碍的作法，已经遭到越来越强烈的反对。
    平等互利，互相尊重国家主权，不仅是社会主义国家在相互之间和同其他国家进行经济合作时所坚持的原则，而且也是亚非会议关于经济合作的决议所确定的原则。按照这个原则，社会主义国家之间建立了新型的经济关系。苏联在经济上和技术上给予中国的友好援助，就是这种关系的伟大范例。苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家根据这一原则同许多亚非国家发展的经济合作，也表现出历史上前所未见的特点。以中国为例，不论是像我们同亚非许多国家那样，通过贸易的途径进行经济合作，或者是像我们同柬埔寨那样，通过无偿的援助进行经济合作，我们的目的都是为了促进彼此的经济发展。我们没有剩余的物资需要倾销。我们没有经济危机需要转嫁。我们不以经济合作为名，对别的国家进行干涉和控制，或者把军事上、政治上和经济上不利的义务强加在别国的身上。
    中国是一个刚刚解放不久的国家。我们的经济还很落后，我们在经济上还没有完全独立。因此，我们的经济力量是有限的，我们主要地还是通过贸易的途径同其他国家进行经济合作。但是，由于我们认识到，经济上的独立对于巩固政治上的独立具有重要的意义，我们在自己进行经济建设的同时，也愿意在可能的范围内贡献我们的微薄力量，帮助其他国家的经济发展。我们并不反对西方国家向经济上还不大发达的国家提供援助，但是，我们不能赞同他们以取得特权为条件的所谓援助。如果西方国家也能够按照我们所遵守的原则，来同其他国家进行经济合作，那么，这不仅对于所有有关国家的经济发展，而且对于改善整个国际局势，都将会发生非常有利的影响。
    在发展国际贸易方面，我们坚持的原则是平等互利、互通有无。中国同锡兰所进行的大米和橡胶的贸易就是一个新的例证。我们既反对强制切断各国之间传统经济联系的贸易禁运政策，也反对用倾销或者其他的办法进行仅仅对一方有利的贸易。
    事实已经证明，受到禁运政策危害的，不是这个政策所针对的社会主义国家，而主要的是被强迫执行这一政策的国家。社会主义国家通过自力更生和互相支持，保证了经济上的共同高涨。但是，被迫执行禁运政策的国家却发现自己的市场大大缩小，国内的经济困难日益严重。最近，这些国家正在设法冲破禁运限制，这是可以理解的，也是值得欢迎的。但是，要收到冲破禁运和发展贸易的效果，就不仅需要撤除国际贸易中的各种人为障碍，而且还要有效地制止蒋介石集团在美国唆使下对各国商船航行自由的危害。近几年来，中国的对外贸易虽然遭到了许多外来的阻碍，还是逐年有所增加。同中国进行贸易的国家和地区，在1954年有47个，到1955年增加到62个。以中国同亚非国家和西方国家的贸易额来说，1955年比1954年增加了28.2％。我们相信，一旦禁运被撤销，随着中国国内建设的蓬勃开展，中国同其他国家进一步扩大贸易，将有广阔的前途。
    各国人民在文化上的交流，正如在经济上的合作一样，也是促使各国之间的和平、友谊和合作得到巩固的一个重要的条件。在历史上，各国人民从来就是通过互相学习和互相吸取优点来丰富和发扬自己的文化的。但是，现在某些国家的政府却反对并且阻止本国人民同不同社会制度国家的人民进行文化交流。这只能被解释为对自己的制度失去信心的表现。例如我国的艺术团体已经同美国的艺术团体就他们互相访问演出一事达成了协议，这显然是符合两国人民的愿望的。但是，由于美国政府的反对，这一协议至今未能执行。我们相信社会主义制度的优越性。我们也毫不怀疑，在社会主义制度下，我国的自然科学、社会科学、哲学和文学艺术将会得到最迅速最广泛的发展。但是另一方面，用现代的水平来衡量，我国还是一个文化上落后的国家。我们要认识到，世界上每一个民族都有它的长处。我们不仅要向苏联和人民民主国家学习他们的长处，而且还要吸取所有其他国家的长处。这只能加速我国社会主义建设的发展，而不会为我们带来任何坏处。因此，我们毫不惧怕，相反地，我们热烈欢迎同一切国家广泛地进行文化交流。事实上，进行文化交流是各国人民的共同愿望。我只需要提到我国的艺术团体和其他国家的艺术团体在进行相互访问时所受到的盛大欢迎，就足以证明这一点。作为增加各国人民之间的相互了解和促进国际合作的一个方法，文化交流已经取得了初步的成就，但是还有更多的工作需要做。就中国来说，我们不会在这方面吝惜我们的力量。
    七年来，中国人民在和平建设自己的国家方面，取得了巨大的成就。我们的祖国正在从一个贫穷落后的农业国逐步地转变为一个繁荣富强的、社会主义工业化的国家。同时，我国的国际地位也已经空前地提高。中国在推动整个国际局势的发展方面，正在起着日益重要的作用。对于许多重大国际问题的解决，中国的意见已经越来越不容忽视。
    现在，拥有十亿以上人口的26个国家已经同我国建立了外交关系。还有更多的国家、更广大的人民同我国保持着贸易上和文化上的联系。显然，任何人要否认中华人民共和国的存在和日益壮大的现实，已经是不可能了。
    不错，美国至今还企图抹杀中国人民选择自己国家制度的权利，拒绝承认中华人民共和国，并且在国际事务中竭力排斥新中国。但是，正如历史已经证明了的，不论怎样的阻挠，冲破旧制度而成长的新生力量终久是要壮大起来的。反对殖民统治的美国独立革命是如此，推翻封建主义统治的法国资产阶级革命是如此，在世界六分之一的土地上根除资本主义统治的俄国十月社会主义革命也是如此。那些目前不承认新中国的人，最好重温一下这些历史事实。
    其实，尽管美国不承认中华人民共和国，美国政府的代表还是在日内瓦同中国政府的代表进行会谈。人们不难从这种表面上矛盾的现象看出，美国不承认中华人民共和国，实际上是为了利用蒋介石集团同中国讨价还价，并且通过蒋介石集团制造紧张局势，以便从中渔利。
    美国在国际事务中竭力排斥新中国，并没有使中国遭到什么损失。相反的，美国阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位和权利，却使联合国丧失了威信，不能按照宪章有效地发挥作用。美国胁迫许多国家不同中国建交，也已经引起了这些国家的不满，加强了他们对美国的离心倾向。就中国来说，不管美国承认不承认，中国都将会日益强大地存在和发展下去，中国同其他国家的接触还会扩大，中国的国际地位还会继续提高。
    在这种无可否认和无法阻挡的现实面前，有些人又在策划制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他们妄想把台湾说成是另外一个中国或者是独立存在的一个国家。但是，这种妄想只能被认为是在强大的现实面前丧失了理智的表现。台湾从来就是中国的一部分，庄严的国际协议也早已承认台湾属于中国。而且，连蒋介石集团也承认台湾是属于中国的。一切中国人民，包括台湾同胞在内，在任何时候，也不会容许把台湾从自己的祖国分割出去。
    妄图制造“两个中国”的人认识到，在国际组织中和国际会议上继续排斥中华人民共和国，已经越来越困难。因此，他们又企图在国际组织中和国际会议上预先造成“两个中国”的形势。中国人民早就看穿了这种阴谋。希望中国陷入这种圈套是徒然的。国际组织和国际会议只是在国际上进行来往和接触的一种形式。中国为了扩大同其他国家的接触和联系，不会因为被排斥在国际组织和国际会议之外而感到困难。
    世界上只有一个中国。唯一能够代表中国人民的只有中华人民共和国政府。我们相信，这个现实终有一天会得到世界上普遍的承认。这一天越早到来，国际间的正常关系就能够越早恢复。
    现在，我向大会报告一下中美会谈的情况。
    在日内瓦举行的中美大使级会谈，自从在1955年9月10日对双方平民回国问题达成协议以后，就进入了关于放弃使用武力问题的讨论，到现在已经快十个月了，还没有达成任何协议。
    中国方面并不反对同美国发表一个在中美关系中互不使用武力或武力威胁的声明。事实上，早在万隆会议期间，中国就已经声明，中国人民不要同美国打仗，中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判，讨论和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势的问题。但是，必须指出，台湾地区的紧张局势完全是由于美国使用武力侵占了中国的领土台湾而造成的。因此，任何关于中美之间互不使用武力的声明，都必须能够导致这种紧张局势的和缓和消除，而不应该使美国侵占台湾的现状得到承认。同时，中国用什么方式解放台湾，完全是中国的主权和内政，不容外人过问，因此，中美两国的声明不能以任何方式干涉这个问题。
    根据这些原则，中国方面曾经建议两种不同形式的声明。如果中美两国在声明中具体提到通过和平谈判解决两国在台湾地区的争端而不诉诸武力，那么，就必须同时明确规定举行中美外长会议，使这一声明得以实现。这就是中国方面在1955年10月27日提出的方案。否则，中美两国可以先发表一个和平解决两国争端而不诉诸武力的原则性的声明，然后由两国大使继续会谈，寻求实现双方这一共同愿望的具体途径。这就是中国方面在1955年12月1日提出的方案。最近，为了照顾美国的意见，中国方面又在今年5月11日建议，中美两国在声明中宣布和平解决两国在台湾地区的争端而不诉诸武力的同时，规定在声明发表后的一定期限内寻求并确定实现这一愿望的途径，包括中美外长会议在内。但是，尽管有了这些建议，美国方面还是不愿意达成协议。
    美国虽然表示不使用武力的原则应该具体地应用到台湾地区，但是却反对确定举行中美外长会议来实现这一原则，甚至也不同意在一定的限期之内，寻求和确定和平解决中美两国争端的途径。不仅如此，美国还坚持它在中国的领土台湾有所谓“单独或集体自卫的权利”。这一切表明，美国的企图是要取得一个对它片面有利的声明，一方面保持美国侵占台湾的现状，另一方面继续干涉中国人民解放台湾。在不能取得这样一个声明的情况下，美国就企图无限期地拖延中美大使级会谈，以便同样达到冻结台湾地区现状的目的。
    美国的这种企图正是中美会谈至今不能达成协议的症结所在。中国不能同意发表一个仅仅对一方有利的声明，也不能容许中美会谈被一方利用为达到片面目的的工具。中国认为，任何共同声明都必须是对双方有利的；同时，中美会谈的继续，也只有在对双方都有利的情况才有可能。解放台湾问题
    最后，我还要讲一讲大家所关心的解放台湾的问题。
      中国人民一定要解放台湾，这是我国六万万人民不可动摇的共同意志。
    我国政府曾经再三指出：中国人民解放台湾有两种可能的方式，即战争的方式和和平的方式；中国人民愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式解放台湾。毫无疑问，如果台湾能够和平解放，那么，对于我们国家，对于我们全体中国人民，对于亚洲和世界的和平，都将是最为有利的。
    现在，和平解放台湾的可能性正在增长。这首先是因为目前国际形势肯定地趋向和缓，美国使用武力侵占台湾和干涉中国内政的行为，遭到了越来越多的爱好和平的国家和人民的反对。从国内形势说，我们伟大的祖国是更加壮大和巩固了，它比过去任何时候都更加使所有爱国的中国人感到自豪。现在，不但具有革命传统的台湾同胞，已经不愿意继续过那痛苦的奴隶生活，而希望早日回到祖国的怀抱；就是在那些从大陆上跑到台湾去的国民党军政人员当中，也有越来越多的人看到，只有实现祖国的和平统一，才是他们的唯一出路。自从我们发出争取和平解放台湾的号召以后，在台湾和海外的国民党军政人员中，已经有不少人表示了他们的爱国愿望。我们相信，愿意促成台湾和平解放和祖国完全统一的人，必然会一天比一天增加，这将是不可抗拒的趋势。
    大势非常清楚，台湾当局追随美国苟延残喘的局面是决不能持久的。他们所追随的外国势力，决不是什么可以指靠的力量；相反地，引狼入室的结果，不但会使他们失掉自己所有的一切，并且随时有被人暗算和遗弃的可能。人们可以从中美两国在日内瓦会谈的不同态度中，得出重要的教训。中国政府始终坚持，只有中美两国在台湾地区的国际争端，才能由中美两国讨论和解决；至于台湾回到祖国的问题，不论采取什么方式，都只能而且完全可以由我们中国人自己处理，决不容外国干涉。可是，美国在谈判中却完全采取另外一种态度。它把台湾当作自己的殖民地，同中国讨价还价。人们还可以看到，现在美国不但侵占了台湾，把它的势力渗透到台湾的政治、军事、经济、文化各个方面，并且还在施展它所惯用的分裂阴谋，在台湾内部制造猜疑倾轧，企图加强控制，从中渔利。但是，美国侵略势力的这种愚弄中国人民、干涉中国内政和分裂中国民族团结的行为，已经引起了台湾国民党军政人员愈来愈强烈的不满。他们当中有不少人，已经表示再也不能忍受那种寄人篱下、随人俯仰的生活；他们要求提高民族自尊心，维护民族尊严，摆脱美国控制，并且要以独立自主的精神，处理自己的内部问题。我们欢迎他们的这种爱国主张。
    我们是一贯主张全民族团结、一致对外的。为了我们伟大祖国和人民的利益，中国共产党人和国民党人曾经两度并肩作战，反对帝国主义。在抗日战争结束以后，我们也曾经努力争取实现国内的和平。中国人民即使在被迫拿起武器进行国内解放战争期间，甚至在大陆解放以后，也没有放弃和平谈判的努力。尽管这些年来，由于美国的武装干涉，我们和台湾的国民党军政人员走上了不同的道路，但是，只要大家以民族和祖国的利益为重，我们仍然可以重新携手团结起来。我们相信，我们久经忧患的伟大民族，一定能够依靠我们自己的努力，实现祖国的完全统一。
    现在，我代表政府正式表示：我们愿意同台湾当局协商和平解放台湾的具体步骤和条件，并且希望台湾当局在他们认为适当的时机，派遣代表到北京或者其他适当的地点，同我们开始这种商谈。
    为了团结一切爱国力量早日实现祖国的完全统一，我愿意在这里再一次宣布，我们对于一切爱国的人们，不论他们参加爱国行列的先后，也不论他们过去犯了多大罪过，都本着“爱国一家”的原则，采取既往不咎的态度，欢迎他们为和平解放台湾建立功勋，并且还将按照他们立功大小，给以应得的奖励和适当的安置。
    台湾的同胞从来就是中国人民不可分离的一部分。我们不但时时刻刻关怀着他们，从各方面支持他们反抗外国统治的斗争，而且随时准备欢迎他们参加祖国的社会主义建设，共享我们民族的荣誉。
    我们了解一切家在大陆、身在台湾的国民党军政人员的处境，希望他们能够早日实现同家人团聚的愿望。他们可以同大陆上的亲友通讯，他们也可以回到大陆来作短期的省亲会友，我们准备给以各种方便和协助。
    我们希望台湾的国民党军政负责人员，在和平解放台湾的事业中，发挥重要的作用。只要朝着这个方向努力，他们将来的地位就会得到肯定的保证。如果他们还有疑问的话，他们可以通过大陆上的亲友得到解释，或者派人来大陆考查，我们保证他们来去自由。
    我们希望台湾的国民党军队人员积极地促成台湾的和平解放。如果这样做，他们就一定能够得到祖国和人民的信赖和照顾。过去在大陆上和平起义的将士所得到的待遇，可以作为先例。
    我们也同样希望一切身在海外其他地方的国民党军政人员，为促进和平解放台湾而努力。只有这样，他们才能使自己免于流落异乡、受人轻视的命运。
    我们重视海外广大的爱国侨胞在推动和平解放台湾的事业中所发挥的积极作用。我们希望曾经或者还在对祖国采取对立态度的少数海外华侨，认清是非，省察大势，跟广大的爱国侨胞站在一起，为促进和平解放台湾的爱国事业作出贡献。
    祖国的大门对于所有的爱国分子都永远是敞开着的。任何一个中国人对于祖国统一的神圣事业都有权利和义务作出自己的贡献。依靠全民族的团结和全国人民的努力，台湾的解放是一定能够实现的。
