In the first quarter of this year, Hunan Province planned to promote 40,000 two-wheeled double-share plows. By early May, more than 29,000 had been transported to various counties, of which about 67% had been sold to agricultural production cooperatives. However, most of these two-wheeled double-share plows that reached the farmers' hands were left there to rust, not participating in the spring plowing. Therefore, they were called "trapped plows" by the farmers.

After discovering this problem, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has ordered relevant departments to conduct inspections and decided to temporarily suspend the promotion of two-wheeled double-share plows. This year's promotion plan has been reduced from the original 50,000 to 25,000. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also instructed local authorities and relevant departments to earnestly carry out modification and testing of these 25,000 two-wheeled double-share plows before the winter plowing in order to gain experience before gradually promoting them. It also requires relevant departments to conduct serious investigations and research to actively find a two-wheeled double-share plow suitable for use in the paddy fields of Hunan Province. Currently, relevant departments in Hunan Province have organized two working groups to go to the countryside to inspect the promotion of two-wheeled double-share plows. The Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture has decided to retrain agricultural implement operators in the use of two-wheeled double-share plows, taking counties as units, during the busy farming season before the autumn harvest, and to train oxen so that these newly promoted two-wheeled double-share plows can be used for plowing after the autumn harvest. The Provincial Department of Agriculture also recently held a provincial agricultural work conference, where the leadership focused on inspecting the promotion of two-wheeled double-share plows in the previous period, from which they learned many useful experiences and lessons.

In the agricultural production upsurge that came with the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization in early spring this year, relevant departments in many special districts and counties rushed to ask for two-wheeled double-share plows from above. Seeing the great enthusiasm below, and seeing that Zhejiang Province promoted 150,000 units this year, the relevant leaders of the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture blindly followed suit and repeatedly expanded the plan to promote two-wheeled double-share plows, from the original preliminary plan of 3,000 units all the way up to 50,000 units, and even had a plan for 150,000 units. In repeatedly expanding the promotion plan, the relevant leaders were clueless. They did not investigate and research beforehand whether this type of two-wheeled double-share plow, designed according to the dry land of the north, could be completely suitable for use in the paddy fields of Hunan Province. At the same time, they did not fully consider the characteristics of Hunan Province, such as having more hills and mountains and less plains, more paddy fields and less dry land, more small hills and less large hills, more small cattle and less large cattle, and narrow rural roads and small field ridges, and whether it was suitable to universally promote two-wheeled double-share plows. The promotion plan was decided late and large, whether the relevant factories could produce them in time, and even if they were produced and transported, whether they could catch up with the spring plowing. Naturally, there was even less talk about investigating and understanding the needs and purchasing power of farmers in various places, and conscientiously doing ideological and technical preparations such as typical demonstrations.

Last year, 345 two-wheeled double-share plows were promoted in typical demonstrations in sixty-one counties throughout the province. At that time, most of them were used to plow slab fields and rarely to plow paddy fields. Even now, farmers in many areas still reflect that two-wheeled double-share plows are better than old-fashioned plows for plowing slab fields. However, this year, when plowing the second pass of paddy fields, farmers believe that the current two-wheeled double-share plow is too heavy and easily sinks, which is not as good as the old-fashioned plow. In this way, buying a two-wheeled double-share plow can only plow the slab field once, which is naturally not worthwhile.

Now this promotion plan with blind and rash emotions has been justly criticized by farmers. Some farmers in mountainous areas bought plows back, but there was no way to use them in small paddy fields. They said that they bought a pile of scrap iron and tied up useful funds. Some farmers in Chenxian Special District reflected that they bought two-wheeled double-share plows but had no large cattle to pull, no large roads to push, no large hills to plow, no one to use them, and no money to pay for them.

In the promotion of two-wheeled double-share plows, the preparations in all aspects were very poor, and the relevant departments did not cooperate well. Therefore, most of the plows were distributed to the counties in late March and early April, and it was even later when they reached the farmers' hands, and most of them did not catch up with the spring plowing. Also, because the plows came late, there was no time to modify them, and as a result, most of them could not be used. The technical instruction and publicity work in most areas did not keep up. When promoting two-wheeled double-share plows, some counties and districts used the wrong method of simply assigning tasks to replace the educational method of typical demonstrations. Some agricultural cooperatives were afraid of being criticized as "conservative and backward" and bought plows, but they did not know how to use them after buying them back. Although most counties ran agricultural implement technology training classes, the training time was short and the content was large, and many farmers still did not know how to use them after returning. Of the 480 agricultural implement operators trained in Linxiang County, 40% only knew how to operate but not how to repair; 30% did not know how to operate or repair. The agricultural implement operator of Tangqiao Agricultural Cooperative in this county installed the tow bar on the plow backwards, resulting in the front plow being eight inches deep and the rear plow being three inches deep, and even two large cattle could not pull it.

### 湖南省检查双轮双铧犁的推广工作

    湖南省检查双轮双铧犁的推广工作  
    新华社记者　胡坚
    湖南省今年第一季度计划推广的四万部双轮双铧犁，到五月上旬运到各县的共有二万九千多部，其中约有67％已经销售给农业生产合作社，但是这些到了农民手里的双轮双铧犁，大部分搁在那里生锈，没有参加春耕翻田，因此被农民叫做“困犁”。
    中共湖南省委员会发现这一问题以后，已经责令有关部门进行检查，并且决定目前暂缓推广双轮双铧犁，今年的推广计划由原来的五万部缩减到二万五千部。中共湖南省委员会还指示各地和各有关部门，对这二万五千部双轮双铧犁在冬季翻板田以前切实作好改装试验工作，以便取得经验后再逐步推广；并且要求有关部门进行认真的调查研究工作，积极设法研究出一种适宜于湖南省稻田使用的双轮双铧犁。现在湖南省有关部门已经组织两个工作组下乡，检查推广双轮双铧犁的工作。湖南省农业厅决定在秋收前的农忙间隙，以县为单位重新训练使用双轮双铧犁的农具手，并且设法训练耕牛，以便使这些新推广的双轮双铧犁能够在秋收后用来翻田。省农业厅还在最近召开全省农业工作会议，领导方面在会上着重检查了前一时期双轮双铧犁的推广工作，从中吸取了许多有益的经验教训。
    今年初春，随着农业合作化高潮而来的农业生产高潮中，许多专区、县有关部门一股劲儿向上面要双轮双铧犁。湖南省农业厅有关领导方面看到下面劲头大，又看到浙江省今年推广十五万部，也就盲目地跟着一股劲儿把推广双轮双铧犁的计划一再扩大，由原来初步计划三千部，一直扩大到五万部，甚至还有过十五万部的打算。在一再扩大推广计划中，有关领导方面是心中无数的。对于这种按照北方旱地设计的双轮双铧犁，事先并没有去调查研究是否完全能适合湖南省水田中使用。同时，没有充分考虑到湖南省丘陵山区多、平原地区少，水田多、旱地少，小丘多、大丘少，小牛多、大牛少和农村路窄、田塍小等特点，是否宜于普遍推广双轮双铧犁；推广计划决定得既晚又大，有关工厂是否一时生产得出来，就是生产和调运来了，是否能赶上春耕翻田。自然，更谈不上调查了解各地农民的需要和购买力，以及认真做好典型示范等思想上和技术上的准备工作了。
    去年全省有六十一个县典型示范推广了345部双轮双铧犁。当时大多是用来翻板田，很少翻水田。直到现在，许多地区的农民仍反映双轮双铧犁翻板田比旧式犁好。但是，今年在翻第二遍水田的时候，农民认为目前的双轮双铧犁太重，容易陷下去，不如旧式犁好。这样，买双轮双铧犁，只能翻一遍板田，自然是不合算的。
    现在这个带有盲目冒进情绪的推广计划已经受到农民的公正批评。有些山区农民买了犁回去，没有办法在小块山田中使用。他们说，买了一堆废铁，积压了有用的资金。郴县专区有些农民反映，买了双轮双铧犁没大牛拉，没大路推，没大丘犁，没人使用和没钱付款。
    在推广双轮双铧犁工作中，各方面的准备工作做得很差，有关部门也没有很好配合。因此，大部分犁在三月底、四月初才分配到县，到农民手里就更晚了，大多没有赶上春耕翻田。又因为犁来得晚，来不及改装，结果大多不能使用。大部地区技术传授和宣传工作也没有跟上去。有的县、区在推广双轮双铧犁的时候，用简单地分派任务的错误作法，代替了典型示范的教育方法。有的农业合作社怕被批评为
  “保守落后”而买了犁，买回去后不晓得怎样使用。虽然大多数县开办了农具技术训练班，但是训练的时间短、内容多，许多农民回去后仍不会使用。临湘县训练的四百八十个农具手，其中有40％只会操作，不会修理；有30％不会操作，也不会修理。这个县的汤桥农业合作社的农具手，把犁上的牵引杆反装了，结果前铧犁八寸深，后铧犁三寸深，两头大牛也拉不动。
