Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. The Shanghai People's Exhibition on the Struggle to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries closed on the 10th. The exhibition was open for 85 days and was visited by over 1.31 million people.

After visiting the exhibition, audiences from many units held discussion meetings and conducted expanded publicity. The materials exhibited at the meeting about leniency to those who confess and severity to those who resist, as well as the model deeds of the people in preventing and exposing spies, were reprinted on blackboards and big-character posters in government offices and factories.

More than 10,000 visitors left their thoughts in the exhibition's suggestion book. They expressed their determination to maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times and in all places and to resolutely assist the government in thoroughly eradicating all counter-revolutionaries. Some viewers were inspired and educated during the visit and immediately went to the exhibition office to report materials about counter-revolutionaries they knew. After seeing the weapons seized from counter-revolutionaries at the exhibition, young student Chen Mingli mobilized his father to hand over a small knife pistol hidden at home by his already arrested counter-revolutionary brother, Chen Minglun, to the public security organs. After visiting the exhibition, female worker Lu Shunnan mobilized her husband to confess to the government about harboring counter-revolutionaries. Some people also dispelled their concerns after visiting and voluntarily confessed their historical problems.

    上海镇压反革命展览会闭幕
    参观人数有一百三十多万
    新华社上海10日电　上海市人民镇压反革命斗争展览会十日闭幕。这个展览会展出八十五天，有131万多人前往参观。
    许多单位的观众参观回去后开了座谈会，并且进行扩大宣传。会上展出的对反革命分子坦白从宽、抗拒从严的材料，以及人民群众防奸反特的模范事迹，被转载在机关、工厂的黑板报和大字报上。
    展览会的意见簿上，留下了一万多个观众的感想。他们表示要随时随地保持高度警惕，坚决协助政府彻底肃清一切反革命分子。有些观众在参观过程中受到启发教育后，马上到展览会办公室检举了他们所知道的反革命分子的材料。青年学生陈明礼在展览会上看到从反革命分子手中缴获的武器后，动员父亲把已经逮捕的反革命分子、他的哥哥陈明伦隐藏在家中的小刀手枪缴给公安机关。女工陆顺南参观展览会后，动员她的丈夫向政府坦白了包庇反革命分子的事情。还有一些人参观后解除了顾虑，自动交代了自己的历史问题。
