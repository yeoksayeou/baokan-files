    Rural Night Market

    As night falls, the center of Bajiazhuang Street in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City is often brightly lit. A long row of stalls selling general merchandise, sundries, and pastries are set up, where many farmers buy their daily necessities. This is a rural night market group specially organized by the shop assistants of the Fifth Central Store of Shijiazhuang City Department Store in the busy farming season to facilitate farmers' purchases.

    Since the end of April, two rural night market groups organized by this central store have been carrying more than 140 kinds of small general merchandise, sundries, and pastries every day, walking dozens of miles back and forth, touring the villages in the suburbs to sell when farmers have time in the evening. They also frequently solicit farmers' opinions and requests for goods, and promptly supply the goods farmers need, which are warmly welcomed by the farmers.

    After this central store opened the rural night market, the total sales amount of goods increased by an average of more than 6% per day, changing the past view that sales were not good in the off-season. (Xinhua News Agency)

    农村夜市
    天黑了，石家庄市郊八家庄街中心常常灯火辉煌，摆着一条长长的百货、杂货和糕点的地摊子，许多农民在这里购买他们的日常生活用品。这是最近石家庄市百货公司第五中心商店的营业员们，在农忙的季节里，为了农民购买方便，专门组织的农村夜市组。
    从四月底以来，这个中心商店组织的两个农村夜市组，每天都携带一百四十多种小百货、杂货和糕点等，来回步行几十里地，巡回到市郊村庄趁农民晚上有闲的时候出售，并且经常征求农民对商品的意见和要求，及时供应农民需要的货物，受到农民热烈的欢迎。
    这个中心店开辟了农村夜市以后，平均每天销售商品总金额约增加6％以上，改变了过去人们认为淡季销售不好的看法。　（新华社）
