    Eliminate Medical Malpractice, Improve People's Health
    —Speeches by Representatives Wang Shuzhen, Lin Qiaozhi, Huang Jiasi, Yu Aifeng, Zhu Futang, Wu Yingkai, and Zhu Xianyi

    Minister of Health Li Dequan pointed out in her speech that "medical malpractice continues to occur in some medical institutions." Other representatives also mentioned the issue of medical malpractice in their speeches, indicating that it remains a serious problem today. This cannot but arouse the close attention and deep self-examination of our health workers.

    In a socialist country, the purpose of health work is to relieve suffering, promote health, prolong life, and enhance labor power, so that the people can healthily and happily serve the cause of socialist construction. Medical malpractice, however, stems from shortcomings and errors in medical work, causing unnecessary economic losses and loss of labor power to the state and individuals, and causing patients unnecessary mental and physical suffering, even sacrificing lives. This is completely contrary to the goals of health work.

    Since liberation, health workers, like people from all walks of life, have received the care and education of the Party and the government, participated in various study and social reform movements, and, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, organized studies by health personnel aimed at correcting service attitudes and eliminating medical malpractice. Work has improved. "Everything for the wounded and sick" has become the direction of effort for the majority of medical workers. But unfortunately, medical malpractice still occurs from time to time. For example, doctors prescribe the wrong prescriptions, nurses give the wrong medicine or injections, hot water bottles burn the skin, children's beds are not properly secured with guardrails, causing patients to fall out of bed, blood types are incorrectly matched during transfusions, and gauze and instruments are left in the abdominal cavity during surgery. Some medical staff have a blunt attitude and lack sympathy and consideration for patients, increasing their suffering; some do not provide appropriate explanations to patients or their families when administering treatment or when the condition changes, causing unnecessary misunderstandings; and some rigidly apply hospital rules, insisting on carrying out prescribed procedures even for seriously ill patients, even refusing seriously ill patients entry to the hospital because they cannot pay the fees according to regulations. These situations are, of course, not in line with the spirit of "everything for the wounded and sick."

    The health leadership departments and the vast majority of health workers in New China feel extremely disgusted by these medical accidents. We no longer cover up our mistakes by protecting each other or hiding our faults from the patients' families, but rather take a responsible stance towards the patients, and treat these shortcomings and errors with a serious attitude. Although we have sometimes defended ourselves based on medical principles when patients have sued hospitals or doctors due to dissatisfaction, on the other hand, we have also proactively filed lawsuits against doctors who have committed serious errors, even without complaints from patients' families, and finally had them punished by the court according to the law. This shows that hating medical malpractice and fighting to eliminate it is the common demand of health workers, patients, and the general public.

    Since everyone hates medical malpractice so much, why does it still occur constantly? While we are not relaxing our fight against medical malpractice, it is meaningful to analyze the causes of its occurrence. The vast majority of doctors, whether for the benefit of patients or for the reputation of the hospital and themselves, want the patients they treat to recover smoothly, and indeed, thousands upon thousands of patients suffering from various difficult and critical illnesses have recovered to health through their careful medical treatment. However, it is an undeniable fact that our country's health care system today cannot meet the needs of the broad masses of the people. In the past, our medical work only served a small number of people, but after liberation, our service targets have become the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our country has successively implemented labor insurance systems for workers and free medical care for staff in state organs and people's organizations, and the broad masses of people, due to the improvement of their lives, also want to see a doctor now when they couldn't afford to in the past. These are all good phenomena, and are worthy of our jubilation and encouragement. However, although the number of medical personnel has also increased in recent years, it still cannot keep up with the needs of the work. Therefore, the work of medical personnel is generally tense. The vast majority of medical personnel are very willing to do everything possible to shoulder this excessive workload. For example, in a certain hospital in Tianjin, doctors have worked continuously for 48 hours in intensive work, and in a certain hospital in Shanghai, doctors often work continuously for more than 24 hours. These examples are not uncommon. When the work is too tense, and seeing many patients waiting for treatment in the waiting room, or when one parturient has not been dealt with yet and another dystocia must be dealt with immediately, undesirable phenomena such as rushing tasks, not working carefully, not explaining in detail, and having a blunt attitude towards patients are prone to occur. It is also because of the busy work and the shortage of personnel that some medical personnel have to shoulder tasks that are disproportionate to their abilities. This is entirely based on the needs of the work, but the work effect is often not satisfactory. In addition, there are some diseases that current medical science cannot solve, but from the patient's point of view, it is completely understandable that they are dissatisfied because the disease has not been cured and they believe it is a medical accident. The above situation exists, but we cannot use it to explain the occurrence of all medical malpractice. We must not deny that some medical personnel have not yet well established the service attitude of "everything for the wounded and sick," and to this day, some medical personnel still do not work meticulously, thoroughly, and with a strong sense of responsibility. If they cure the disease, they seem to have done the patient a great favor, and if they make a mistake, they emphasize objective difficulties. They often forget that medical work is related to the health and lives of the people, and a slight mistake will bring great losses to the country. They do not even think that medical workers should not only treat the patient's physical pain, but also should not give the patient any mental trauma. There are many medical accidents that are completely unnecessary and must be completely eliminated.

    To eliminate medical malpractice, the primary task is to strengthen the political study and ideological education of medical personnel, so that every medical worker can recognize that his work is an indispensable part of the cause of socialist construction, and his sacred duty is to prevent people's diseases and protect people's health. Medical malpractice should be treated with a serious attitude, thoroughly investigated, and strictly handled, so that medical personnel can all receive ideological education. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the professional level of medical personnel. Here, not only the improvement of doctors' technical level, but also the strengthening of nursing work and the establishment of its professional ideology are very important. At present, many experienced and technically skilled medical personnel are busy with administrative work and social activities, and not only have few opportunities to directly engage in medical work, but also have no time to guide the work of junior medical personnel. How to allow senior technical personnel to have more time to do technical work, and how to quickly cultivate new forces, is an important issue for improving the quality of medical care today, and also a key to eliminating medical malpractice. In addition, it is also essential for medical institutions to improve and establish reasonable working systems and medical care routines to improve the quality of work and prevent medical malpractice.

    In short, medical workers still have many shortcomings. We must strengthen political study and ideological education, improve working systems, and improve professional levels in order to improve medical work and eliminate accidents. We comrades who are doing leadership work must take the elimination of medical malpractice as a central task, strictly examine our own bureaucracy and right-leaning conservative thinking, regularly check the work style of medical personnel, and carefully check the shortcomings existing in all working systems, and unremittingly correct all errors and shortcomings, overcome all difficulties, and strive to prevent medical malpractice. Although this is an arduous task, the transformation of medical personnel has particularly favorable conditions. Our work is in constant contact with the broad masses of the people, and therefore we can receive the direct supervision, help, and support of the broad masses of the people. The progress of medical personnel in recent years is inseparable from the criticism and encouragement of patients and the masses. Here, we would also like to point out that appropriate and serious criticism is of great help to the improvement of medical workers, but excessive censure may sometimes produce some side effects. There have been doctors who, because they are afraid of making mistakes, being criticized, and being punished, become timid in their work, dare not take responsibility, and refer difficult-to-treat diseases to "consultations" and even push them to other hospitals, and sometimes exaggerate the dangers of the illness to patients and their families to reduce their own responsibility. There have also been patients who, because they have read terrifying medical malpractice reports in the newspapers, have great concerns in their minds when seeing a doctor, taking medicine, or undergoing surgery, fearing that they will also be victims of another medical malpractice. From the point of view of the correct development of medical work and from the point of view of protective medical care, the existence of these situations is very unfavorable to the patient's recovery. We sincerely ask the media to offer as much criticism and suggestions as possible on our work, and to help us improve our work from a positive perspective, so that a good relationship of mutual trust and mutual care can be established between the broad masses of people and medical personnel. Let us work together to eliminate medical malpractice and improve the people's health.

### 消灭医疗事故，提高人民卫生事业——王淑贞、林巧稚、黄家驷、俞霭峰、诸福棠、吴英恺、朱宪彝代表的发言

    消灭医疗事故，提高人民卫生事业
    ——王淑贞、林巧稚、黄家驷、俞霭峰、诸福棠、吴英恺、朱宪彝代表的发言
    卫生部李德全部长在她的发言中曾经指出“有些医疗机构中医疗事故仍不断发生”，在其他代表的发言中，也有提到医疗事故的问题，说明医疗事故到今天仍然是一个严重的问题。这就不能不引起我们卫生工作者的密切注意和深刻检查。
    在社会主义国家，卫生工作的目的是解除痛苦、促进健康、延长寿命、增强劳动力，使人民能健康地、愉快地为社会主义建设事业服务；而医疗事故是由于医疗工作中的缺点和错误，使国家和个人遭受不必要的经济消耗和劳动力的丧失，使病人遭受不必要的精神上和肉体上的痛苦，甚至牺牲了生命。这是和卫生工作的目标完全背道而驰的。
    解放几年来，卫生工作者和其他各界人民一样，受到了党和政府的关怀和教育，参加了各项学习和社会改革运动，还在卫生部领导下，组织了以改正服务态度、消灭医疗事故为目的的卫生人员学习，工作是有改进的。“一切为了伤病员”已成为广大医务工作者的努力方向。但是不幸的是医疗事故还是不断发生，例如，医生开错药方，护士发错药、打错针，热水袋烫伤皮肤，小儿床不拉好栏杆以致病人从床上跌下，输血时配错血型，手术时把纱布、器械遗留在腹腔内等等。有些医护人员态度生硬，对病人缺乏同情和体贴，增加了病人的痛苦；有些在进行治疗或当病情有变化时没有向病人或家属作恰当的解释因而引起不必要的误会；还有一部分人生硬地引用医院条文，对重病患者亦要坚持执行规定手续，甚至因不能照章纳费，而将重病患者拒绝于医院大门之外。这些情况当然是和“一切为了伤病员”的精神不相符合的。
    新中国的卫生领导部门和广大卫生工作者对这些医疗事故是感到极度痛恨的。我们已经不再是互相包庇，在病家面前掩盖自己的错误，而是站在对病人负责的立场，以严肃的态度来对待这些缺点和错误的。虽然当病家因不满意而控告医院或医生的时候，有时我们曾经根据医理作过辩护，但在另一方面，我们也有因为医生犯了严重的错误，虽未经病家控告，而主动地对医生提起控诉，最后由法院依法处分的例子。这就说明，痛恨医疗事故，为消灭医疗事故而斗争，是卫生工作者、病家和广大群众的一致要求。
    既然大家都如此痛恨医疗事故，为什么医疗事故还是不断发生呢？在我们毫不放松对医疗事故作斗争的同时，分析一下医疗事故发生的原因是有其意义的。绝大多数的医生，无论是为了病人的利益，或者是为了医院和个人的信誉，没有不希望他所治疗的病人能顺利恢复健康的，而且的确有千千万万患有各种疑难重症的病人，经他们的悉心医疗，恢复了健康。但是我国今天的卫生保健事业还不能满足广大人民的需要，是一个不可否认的事实。在过去，我们的医务工作只是为少数人服务，而解放后，我们的服务对象已变为广大的工、农、兵。我国已先后实行了工人的劳保制度和国家机关、人民团体工作人员的公费医疗，广大人民亦因生活的改善，过去不能看病的，现在也要看病了。这些都是很好的现象，是值得我们欢欣鼓舞的。但是几年来，医务人员的数目虽然亦有增加，仍然还是跟不上工作的需要，因此医务人员的工作一般是紧张的。绝大部分的医务人员是很乐意地尽一切可能来负担这过重的工作，例如，在天津某医院曾有医生在紧张工作中连续值班了48小时之久，在上海某医院医生时常连续值班超过24小时，这些例子也还不是少见的。在工作过分紧张，眼看着许多病人在候诊室等待治疗，或在一个产妇还没有处理完毕而另一个难产又必需立刻处理的时候，赶任务、工作不仔细、解释不详细、对病人态度生硬等等不应有的现象就容易发生了。也就是因为工作忙、人员少，就不得不使有些医务人员担负起和他们的能力不相称的任务。这是完全从工作需要出发的，但是在工作效果上就往往不能令人满意。此外，也有一些疾病，是目前医学科学所不能解决的问题，但是从病家的角度来看，因为病没有治好，认为是医疗事故而感到不满，也是完全可以理解的。上述情况是存在的，但是我们不能用它来解释一切医疗事故的发生。我们决不能否认有些医务人员还没有很好地树立起“一切为了伤病员”的服务态度，到今天仍有一部分医务人员工作不细致、不深入、责任心不强。医好了病，就好像对病人有莫大恩惠，出了差错就强调客观的困难。他们时常忘记了医务是关系着人民的健康和生命，稍有差错就会给国家带来莫大的损失。他们更不想到，医务工作者不仅是要医治病人肉体上的痛苦，也不应该给予病人任何精神上的创伤。有不少的医疗事故是完全不应有的，并且是必须彻底消灭的。
    要消灭医疗事故，首要的工作是加强医务人员的政治学习和思想教育，使每一个医务人员都能认识到他的工作是社会主义建设事业中不可缺少的一个部分，他的神圣职责是防止人民疾病、保障人民健康。应该以严肃的态度来对待医疗事故，深入检查、严格处理，使医务人员都能得到思想教育。其次是要提高医护人员的业务水平，这里，不仅包括医生技术水平的提高，护理工作的加强及其专业思想的建立，也是非常重要的。现在还有不少经验多、技术好的医务人员是忙于行政工作和社会活动，不但很少有直接进行医疗工作的机会，也没有时间指导初级医务人员的工作。如何使高级技术人员有更多时间做技术工作，使新生的力量能迅速地培植起来，是今天要提高医疗质量的重要问题，亦是消灭医疗事故的一个关键。此外，医疗机构中还须改善和建立合理的工作制度和医护常规，以提高工作质量，并且预防医疗事故，也是十分必要的。
    总之，医务工作者的缺点还非常多，我们必须加强政治学习和思想教育、改善工作制度、提高业务水平，以改进医疗工作、消灭事故。我们做领导工作的同志们必须把消灭医疗事故作为一个中心任务，严格地检查自己的官僚主义和右倾保守思想，经常检查医护人员的工作作风，并且认真检查一切工作制度中存在的缺点，毫不放松地矫正所有的错误和缺点，克服任何困难，为预防医疗事故而努力。这虽然是一项艰巨任务，但是医务人员的改造是有特殊有利条件的。我们的工作是和广大人民有经常接触的，因而是可以得到广大人民的直接督导、帮助和支持的。几年来医务人员的进步，是和病家以及群众的批评和鼓励分不开的。在这里我们也愿意指出，适当的严肃的批评，对医务工作者的改进是有很大帮助的，但是过分的指摘有时也会产生一些副作用，曾经有医生因为怕犯错误、受批评和处分，在工作中变得缩手缩脚，不敢负责任，遇有稍难医治的病就大事“会诊”，甚至推往别的医院，也有时对病人和家属夸大病情的危险性以减轻自己的责任。也曾经有病人，因为在报上看过令人可怕的医疗事故，而在看病、吃药或接受手术时，思想上发生极大的顾虑，害怕自己也会是另一医疗事故的牺牲品。从医疗工作的正确开展，和从保护性医疗的观点来看，这些情况的存在，对病人恢复健康都是非常不利的。我们诚恳地要求舆论界对我们的工作尽量提出批评和建议，从积极方面来帮助我们改进工作，以使广大群众和医务人员间树立起互相信任、互相爱护的良好关系。让我们共同为消灭医疗事故、提高人民卫生事业而奋斗。
