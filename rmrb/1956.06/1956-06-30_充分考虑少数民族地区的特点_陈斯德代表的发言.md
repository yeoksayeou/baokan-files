I, representing the minority nationalities of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

In order to develop transportation, education, health, and other construction undertakings in minority areas, the national treasury already spent nearly 600 million yuan in 1955, and the national budget for minority areas in 1956 has been increased to more than 790 million yuan, an increase of 32.56 percent compared to 1955. The Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives contains specific provisions requiring attention to unity and mutual assistance between nationalities, respect for the customs and habits of all nationalities, and attention to absorbing representatives of all nationalities to participate in the leadership of the cooperative. All of this fully embodies the correct ethnic policy of the Party and Chairman Mao, which conforms to the interests of all ethnic groups. All ethnic minorities across the country will actively support these measures.

Now, allow me to express some opinions on the agricultural cooperation movement, as well as the economic, cultural, educational, and health construction in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

Our prefecture is a revolutionary base area. Since liberation several years ago, thanks to the implementation of correct ethnic policies and the care and support of the Party and the government, significant achievements have been made in the economic construction, culture, education, and health of the minority areas of Hainan. The material and cultural lives of the Li, Miao, and Hui people have also improved considerably. Taking agricultural production as an example, as a result of preliminary reforms to the primitive farming methods, the grain output of Hainan Autonomous Prefecture in 1955 reached 343.24 million jin, an increase of 43 percent compared to 1952, exceeding the province's assigned five-year production increase target for our prefecture. In terms of school education, the number of primary schools in our prefecture has been increasing year by year, and there are now 524 primary schools with 50,837 students, and five middle schools with 2,136 students. In addition, certain achievements have also been made in facilities such as highway transportation and medical and health care.

As for the agricultural cooperation movement in our prefecture, it was launched relatively late. By the second half of 1955, a total of 135 elementary and advanced cooperatives had been established, 80 percent of which increased production. After the high tide of agricultural cooperation swept the country at the beginning of this year, the socialist consciousness of farmers of all ethnic groups in our prefecture has been improved to a certain extent, and they have asked to establish cooperatives. Since February, the agricultural cooperation movement in our prefecture has begun to shift to a new stage centered on the development of advanced cooperatives. At present, a total of 424 advanced cooperatives have been established in the prefecture, with 59,340 participating households, accounting for 52 percent of the total households in the prefecture. After the establishment of advanced cooperatives, certain achievements have been made in improving the socialist consciousness of cooperative members, influencing farmers outside the cooperative, and promoting agricultural production. However, due to impetuousness in leadership, simply pursuing quantity, acting subjectively, and failing to combine well with the actual conditions of minority areas and acting according to ability, and insufficient publicity, education, and other preparatory work, the following shortcomings and problems have emerged in the process of establishing cooperatives, which I know of, and deserve our attention.

(1) The residential areas of minority nationalities in our prefecture are extremely dispersed, and the villages are far apart. In order to establish large advanced cooperatives, party and government leaders and cadres initially wanted to concentrate and merge several villages, asking farmers to move. This practice violated the habits of farmers, was "laborious and wasteful," and was not conducive to production. Although it has been corrected later, it has already had a negative impact on the masses. The Miao people in our prefecture have always lived in the mountains, relying on cutting down mountains to grow crops. In order to adapt to the development of agricultural cooperation and close the mountains for afforestation, the leadership decided to move them all down the mountains in May this year to organize cooperatives. Just as they were building cottages and preparing to move down, an unexpected drought arrived, and the leadership decided to focus on drought resistance, and the Miao relocation work was unconditionally suspended. As a result, they could not move, and they were not allowed to cut down the mountains for cultivation, which led to the failure of the early rice production of the Miao people living in the mountains this year, and they were in a dilemma for a time, and their lives were extremely difficult, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the Miao people. For example, the Hui farmers in a township in Yaxian County have always engaged in fishing as a sideline, but after cooperation, the cadres asked them to concentrate their efforts on farming and did not allow them to fish anymore. As a result, fishing boats and nets were abandoned and left to rot, and the income of Hui farmers decreased, resulting in considerable losses. These shortcomings are all caused by not fully taking into account the specific conditions and characteristics of minority areas.

(2) The time for expanding elementary agricultural cooperatives into advanced cooperatives in our prefecture was short, and the scale was too large. However, the cadres lacked experience in establishing and reforming the management system of advanced cooperatives and did not pay enough attention to it. As a result, confusion occurred in management in the early stages of establishing cooperatives. Due to the unsound labor organization and the blind and unreasonable assignment of work, waste of labor was quite serious. Some cooperatives could not weed even five mu of land in a day with more than 30 people, and some cooperatives only plowed half a mu of land per day with one laborer but received 16 work points. Because no one was responsible for the quality of work, the production plans of cooperative members were generally not well completed. What is particularly serious is that no one was responsible for the management and care of the cattle, and a large number of them died. In Dongfang Township of Dongfang County and Fujian Township of Baoting County alone, as many as 94 large and small cattle died in agricultural cooperatives, which brought great losses to the farmers.

(3) Precisely because of the confusion in management and the unsoundness of labor organization, some cooperative members wasted their working hours, but their income was reduced instead. The cooperative members went to the fields to work at about 6 a.m. and did not return home until 7 or 8 p.m. After cooking and eating, it was already 9 or 10 p.m., but they still had to attend meetings to listen to work assignments and record points. Such meetings often lasted until 2 or 3 a.m., even until the cock crowed. Therefore, the farmers were not only short of sleep, but also could not find time to get haircuts or mend clothes. More seriously, because the farmers did not have time to engage in sideline occupations and lacked cash income, they did not even have money to buy salt. Therefore, some minority farmers reflected that "socialism is good, but it is too busy and too difficult."

(4) Our prefecture originally planned to realize socialist cooperation by the end of April this year and establish 1,000 advanced cooperatives. A thousand accounting personnel were sent from other places, preparing to have one accountant in each cooperative. The intention was good. However, later, only 424 advanced cooperatives were established. In order to accommodate these cadres, the number of accountants was increased to two in each cooperative. This practice increased the burden on agricultural cooperatives, and the batch of accounting personnel lacked ethnic policies and ideological education in advance, could not get used to the mountain life, and could not endure hardship. Many have already fled, and some are fleeing back. Turning good things into bad things is also an example.

(5) The Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives stipulates that "in cooperatives jointly formed by more than two ethnic groups, it is necessary to promote the spirit of the majority taking care of the minority and the advanced helping the backward, strengthen unity, and run the cooperative well." This provision is completely correct. But some of our joint cooperatives do not follow this spirit. For example, in a joint cooperative composed of Han and Hui people, the Han farmers have private plots, but the Hui farmers who did not engage in farming in the past do not have private plots. Even the Han farmers were allocated ditches, but the Hui farmers were not allowed to use the ditches to release water because they thought the Hui farmers would not irrigate, which caused disputes, and the district cadres also favored the Han farmers based on the same "reason." The existence of these situations hinders the unity of ethnic issues.

It is undeniable that the socialist consciousness of the minority farmers in Hainan Autonomous Prefecture is generally not as high as that of the Han farmers. In the early stages of establishing advanced cooperatives, the mobilization work was relatively rough. A considerable number of well-to-do middle peasants did not understand the policies well, and their participation in agricultural cooperatives was not entirely conscious and voluntary, but rather with a sense of "following the crowd." Therefore, once they saw that the cooperative work had deviated and conflicted with their current personal interests, and the cooperative's management was chaotic and production was poor, they would be worried and uneasy about the development prospects of the cooperative, and even some cooperative members appeared to want to withdraw from the cooperative. Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in his report that "while opposing conservatism, we must also oppose the tendency of impetuous advancement." "The result of impetuous advancement will not help the development of socialist undertakings, but will only lead to losses." This is particularly applicable to minority areas with relatively backward economic culture and relatively low level of political awareness. Without fully considering the characteristics of minority areas, promoting the agricultural cooperation movement prudently based on the principle of voluntariness, and acting hastily, the ideological mobilization is not deep and thorough, resulting in chaos in society, which is not conducive to the development of socialism. The experience of our prefecture from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives should be seriously noted by the relevant parties.

In addition, in terms of transportation, education, health, and other facilities, the cadres also have the following deviations in implementation, which deserve attention.

(1) When building provincial roads in our prefecture in May this year, farmers were required to perform voluntary labor and bring their own rice to work. However, the farmers who joined the cooperative were not counted work points in the cooperative. Some farmers felt that they were at too much of a disadvantage and ran away. This practice that aroused the dissatisfaction of the farmers should be corrected.

(2) In order to realize the method of running primary schools by the people and develop school education in our prefecture, it is planned that from this year, the construction of new schools, school buildings, teachers' salaries, and public expenses will be raised by the masses themselves, and in areas with advanced cooperatives, they will be run by the cooperatives, and it is decided to charge fees, 3 yuan per student per semester for senior primary school and 2 yuan for junior primary school. I think this method will increase the burden on agricultural cooperatives and minority people and is not suitable for the economic situation of the minority nationalities in our prefecture. As far as I know, some farmers, after seeing this method, feel that they cannot afford the tuition fees, and it is better to let their children participate in agricultural labor, which can earn some work points, so they do not let their children go to school. At the same time, primary school teachers, seeing the reduction in students, are afraid that it will affect their salaries, and they cannot teach with peace of mind. Therefore, the promotion of this method should be carefully considered.

(3) According to the suggestion of Baoting County, the leadership of our prefecture decided to promote the method of collecting health fees in various counties: it is stipulated that farmers who join the cooperative should pay a health fee of 2 yuan per person per year, which will be deducted from the welfare fund of the cooperative, and individual farmers who used to receive free medical treatment will now have to pay half or full fees, and those who pay half fees will have to pay full fees. This method has also increased the burden on the minority people. We know that the Li and Miao people in Hainan have always been superstitious about gods and ghosts, and they also seek gods and worship ghosts when they are sick. Now, they see that enjoying modern medical care requires spending money, and the district and county health institutions are far away from the villages. The minority people will inevitably have the idea of ​​killing chickens, dogs, pigs, and even cattle to worship ghosts rather than spending money to travel to seek medical treatment. Therefore, the method of collecting health fees not only increases the burden on the people, but also hinders the development of health care in minority areas and the improvement of people's health.

Regarding the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems, as the vice governor of the autonomous prefecture, I should bear the responsibility after reviewing myself. Now, in response to the shortcomings and problems, I put forward the following suggestions:

(1) In view of the fact that the level of economic and cultural development of the minority nationalities in our prefecture is very backward and the living standards of the people are still very low, the government must continue to actively support and help in terms of finance and economy, and cannot weaken the support and help to the minority nationalities in the prefecture just because the autonomous prefecture has established advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives and can be self-reliant. The funds for school education and health care should also be covered by the government for a certain period of time, and the method of primary school funding being raised by agricultural cooperatives or the masses should be implemented slowly.

(2) In view of the fact that the establishment of advanced cooperatives is relatively rough, rectification work must be carried out seriously in the future. Supplementary classes must be conducted for the publicity and education of some farmers with low socialist consciousness, and the management system of the cooperative must be gradually improved. When carrying out the rectification work, the interests of the collective and individual members of the cooperative (including long-term and current interests) must be taken into account. The working women of minority nationalities have particularly difficult lives and should be given special care.

(3) In view of the fact that sideline occupations are an important source of income for the minority people in our prefecture and handicraft production is very backward, we must vigorously assist and develop them according to local conditions. For example, rattan ware manufacturing, agricultural tool processing, logging, fishing, and animal husbandry can be promoted separately according to local conditions, and the government should provide assistance in technical equipment. In addition, weaving is a family sideline of minority women, and they can also be assisted in improving and developing it technically.

    充分考虑少数民族地区的特点
    ——陈斯德代表的发言
    我代表海南黎族苗族自治州的少数民族，对李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长所作的报告，表示完全同意。
    为了发展少数民族地区的交通、教育、卫生和其他建设事业，1955年的国家财政已经支出了近六亿元的巨款，1956年的国家预算对少数民族地区的支出又增加为七亿九千多万元，比1955年增长百分之三十二点五六。高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）里头，有特定的条文规定要注意民族间的团结互助，尊重各民族的风俗习惯，在合作社的领导成分中要注意吸收各民族的代表参加。这一切都充分体现了党和毛主席的正确的民族政策，符合各民族的利益，全国各少数民族对于这些措施一定会积极拥护。
    现在让我就海南黎族苗族自治州的农业合作化以及经济、文教、卫生建设事业的情况和问题发表一点意见。
    我州是革命根据地，解放几年以来，由于正确的民族政策的执行，由于党和政府的关怀和支持，海南少数民族地区的经济建设、文教和卫生事业都有了显著的成绩，黎族、苗族和回族人民的物质和文化生活也有了相当的改善。以农业生产来说对原始的耕作方式进行初步的改革的结果，海南自治州1955年的粮食产量已达三亿四千三百二十四万斤，比1952年增加了百分之四十三，已超过省分配我州的五年增产指标。以学校教育来说，我州小学的数目年有增加，现在已有小学五二四所，学生五○、八三七人，中学五所，学生二、一三六人，此外，在公路交通、医疗卫生等方面的设施，也取得了一定的成绩。
    至于我州的农业合作化运动，发动较迟，到1955年下半年共建立了初级、高级社一三五个，其中百分之八十增加了生产。今年初，农业合作化高潮在全国掀起以后，我州各族农民的社会主义觉悟有了一定的提高，纷纷要求办社。从二月份起，我州的农业合作化运动便开始转入了以发展高级社为中心的新阶段。现在，全州共建了高级合作社四二四个，参加农户五九，三四○户，占全州总户的百分之五十二。高级社建成以后，不论在提高社员的社会主义觉悟上，对社外农民的影响上，对农业生产的推动作用上都取得了一定的成绩。但是，由于领导上的急躁情绪，单纯追求数量，凭主观办事，没有很好地结合少数民族地区的实际情况量力而行，宣传教育和其他准备工作做得不够，在建社过程中，就我所知，出现了如下的一些缺点，发生了如下的一些问题，值得我们注意。
    （一）我州少数民族的住区极为分散，各个村庄之间相隔很远，党政领导和干部为了建立大的高级社，初时曾经要若干村庄集中和合并起来，要求农民搬家。这种做法既违反农民的习惯，并且“劳民伤财”不利于生产，后来虽然已得到纠正，但对群众已产生了不好的影响。我州苗胞向来居住在山上，靠砍山种山过活。为了适应农业合作化的发展和封山育林，领导上决定今年五月间全部搬下山来，组织合作社。正当他们盖建茅房，准备搬下的时候，不料旱灾到来，领导又决定全面抗旱，移苗工作便无条件的停止了。结果，他们搬不成，住在山上，又不准他们砍山耕种，使得今年住在山上的苗胞的早造生产落空，一时间陷于进退两难，生活极为困难，引起苗胞的不满。再如崖县一个乡的回族农民，向以海上打鱼为副业，但合作化以后，干部们要他们集中力量种田，不让他们再捕鱼。结果，渔船、渔网既弃置一旁，听任霉烂，而回族农民的收入又在减少，损失颇大。这些缺点都是由于没有充分照顾少数民族地区的具体情况与特点所造成。
    （二）我州初级农业社扩建为高级社，时间既短，规模偏大，而干部们对于高级社的经营管理制度的建立和改建，既缺乏经验，又重视不够，以致建社的初时，经营管理方面出现了混乱的现象。由于劳动组织不健全，派工盲目和不合理，窝工浪费相当严重，有的社三十多人一天除草不够五亩，有的社一个劳动力每天犁田半亩却得到工分十六分。由于工作好坏无人负责，社员的生产计划，一般完成得不够好。尤其严重的是耕牛无人负责管养，大量死亡，仅东方县东方乡和保亭县福建乡的农业社死掉大、小牛就有九十四头之多，这给农民带来了很大的损失。
    （三）正由于经营管理的混乱，劳动组织的不健全，有些社的社员浪费了他们的劳动时间，而收入反见减少。社员们从早上六点钟左右就下地出勤，到晚上七时、八时才回到家里，烧饭，吃饭后，已经是九、十点钟，但还要开会，听候派工和记分。这样的会往往开到深夜两三点钟，以至鸡啼。因此，农民们不但睡眠不足，而且找不到时间理发、补衣服。更严重的，由于农民们的没有时间搞副业，缺乏现金收入，连吃盐也没钱买。所以，少数民族有的农民反映“社会主义好是好的，但是既太忙，又太困难了”。
    （四）我州原计划今年四月底实现社会主义合作化，建立高级社一千个，从外地派来了一千个会计人员，准备每一个社都有一个会计，用意本来是好的。但是，后来高级社只办了四二四个，为了容纳这些干部，每社会计增派到两个人。这种做法既增加了农业社的负担，而事先对这批会计人员又缺少民族政策及思想教育，过不惯山区生活，吃不了苦，已经逃了不少，有些也正在逃回去了。把好事办成坏事，这也是一个例子。
    （五）高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）规定“有二个以上的民族所联合组成的合作社里，要发扬多数照顾少数、先进帮助落后的精神，加强团结，办好合作社。”这个规定是完全正确的。但我们有些联合社的作法都同这规定的精神有出入。例如在汉族与回族组成的联合社里，汉族农户有自留地，而过去不从事耕作的回族农民却没有自留地，甚至汉族农民分得水沟，而认为回族农民不会灌溉，不让他们利用水沟放水，以致引起争执，而区干部也根据同一“理由”偏于汉族农民。这些情况的存在，有碍于民族问题的团结。
    无容讳言的，海南自治州的少数民族农民的社会主义觉悟，一般上没有汉族农民那样的高。在建立高级社的初时，发动工作比较粗糙，有相当部分的富裕中农，对政策的理会不够，参加农业社不是完全自觉自愿，而带有“随大流”的意味。所以一当他们看到建社工作出了偏差，与个人的目前利益有抵触，社的经营管理又混乱，生产不好，他们对社的发展前途便会疑虑不安，甚至出现了个别社员闹退社的现象。李先念副总理在报告中指出“在反对保守主义的时候，必须同时反对急躁冒进的倾向。”“急躁冒进的结果并不能帮助社会主义事业的发展，而只能招致损失。”这话对于经济文化比较落后，政治觉悟水平比较低的少数民族地区特别适用。没有充分考虑少数民族地区的特点，根据自愿的原则，审慎地推行农业合作化运动，而操切从事，思想发动不深不透，结果社会造成混乱，不利于社会主义的发展。我州由初级社转为高级社的经验，是应该引起有关方面严重注意的。
    此外，在交通、教育、卫生等设施方面，干部在执行上也有如下的一些偏差，值得注意。
    （一）我州今年五月建筑省道时，要农民义务劳动，自己带米去干活，而入社的农民在社内又不计工分，有些农民认为太过吃亏而逃跑掉。这种引起农民不满的作法是应该纠正的。
    （二）我州为了实现小学民办的办法，发展学校教育，打算今年起，新建学校、校舍、教师工资、公杂费由群众自筹，有高级社的地区则由社办，并决定收费，每生每学期高小三元，初小二元。我认为这种办法会增加农业社和少数民族人民的负担，与我州少数民族的经济情况不相适应。据我所知，有些农民看到这个办法后，认为学费出不起，不如让子女参加农业劳动，还可以挣得一些工分，因而不让子女上学。同时小学教师们看到学生减少，恐怕会影响自己的工资，也不能安心教学。因此，推行这个办法应该慎重考虑。
    （三）我州领导方面根据保亭县的建议，决定在各县推行征收卫生费的办法：规定入社的农民每人每年缴卫生费二元，由社内公益金项下扣缴，而单干农民从前医疗免费的，现在要缴纳半费或全费，半费的要缴全费。这项办法也增加了少数民族人民的负担。我们知道，海南黎族苗族人民一向迷信神鬼，有病也是求神祭鬼。现在，他们看到享受现代化的医疗需要花钱，而区县卫生机构又离村庄很远，少数民族人民，自然不免产生与其花钱跋涉求医不如杀鸡、杀狗、杀猪甚至杀牛祭鬼的想法。所以，征收卫生费的办法，不但加重人民的负担，而且对于在少数民族地区发展卫生保健事业，提高人民健康水平也是有妨碍的。
    以上所存在的缺点与问题，我自己作为自治州的副州长，检讨起来，应负有责任。现在针对缺点与问题提出我如下的建议：
    （一）鉴于我州少数民族的经济文化发展水平非常落后，人民生活水平依然很低，政府必须在财政、经济方面继续积极支持和帮助，不能因为自治州已经建立高级农业生产合作社，就可以自力更生，而减弱对本州少数民族的支持和帮助。对于学校教育与卫生医疗的经费，在一定时期内也应由政府包起来，小学经费由农业社或群众自筹的办法更应从缓实行。
    （二）鉴于高级社的建立比较粗糙，今后必须认真进行整顿工作，对于部分社会主义觉悟不高的农民的宣传教育要进行补课，社的经营管理制度必须逐步改进。在进行整顿工作的时候，必须照顾到社的集体与社员个人的利益（包括长远的与目前的利益）。少数民族的劳动妇女生活特别艰苦，尤应予以照顾。
    （三）鉴于副业是我州少数民族人民收入的重要来源，手工业生产非常落后，必须大力协助，因地制宜地加以发展。例如藤器制造、农具加工、采伐木材、捕鱼、畜牧等业都可以根据当地情况分别提倡，在技术设备上，政府应予以协助。此外，织布为少数民族妇女的家庭副业，也可以在技术方面协助她们改进和发展。
