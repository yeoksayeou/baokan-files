    I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    The figures listed by Vice Premier Li in his report on the 1955 national final accounts vividly reflect the brilliant achievements our people have made in all aspects of the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong in the past year. The 1956 national budget proposed by Vice Premier Li on behalf of the State Council is very proactive, both in terms of revenue and expenditure plans. It is a budget that accelerates national construction on a solid and reliable foundation; it is a budget that reflects the high tide of socialism and strives to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Undoubtedly, the people of the whole country will work with excitement and encouragement, engaging in intensive work and creative labor, and striving to victoriously realize the financial tasks and various construction tasks for 1956.
  Vice Premier Li also expressed deep concern for the people's livelihood in his report on the 1956 national budget, and announced some relevant measures to improve the people's material and cultural life. I believe that these measures are both necessary and feasible. Only in a country led by the working class can the issues of the laboring people's livelihood and welfare receive timely attention and importance from the government. I believe that the various measures taken by the state to gradually improve the material and cultural life of workers and staff, and to meet their needs based on the principles of necessity and possibility, on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity, will surely be warmly supported by all workers and staff. In the high tide of socialism, workers and staff will further enhance their enthusiasm for labor, and develop production more, faster, better, and more economically, and develop the cause of socialist construction. The criticisms raised by Vice Premier Li in his report regarding workers' wages, welfare, and safety are also in line with the actual situation in our Lüda City. Here, I only want to reflect on some issues related to employee housing, and I hope that all representatives will offer criticism and correction!
    Lüda City is an old coastal industrial city and also a frontier of national defense. Industry is mainly concentrated in the Ganjingzi and Shahekou districts. Most of the houses and other public facilities were built during the period of enemy and puppet rule. The layout of urban construction can be said to be basically fixed. Various public facilities have a certain degree of modernization, but they are mostly concentrated in areas where Japanese people used to live, and are rarely distributed in areas where Chinese laborers live, and the equipment is old and must be regularly maintained and repaired. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, Chinese workers and staff lived for many years in dilapidated, damp, and dark small houses, overcrowded, and many workers and staff lived far from the factories, some dozens of miles away, making it inconvenient to travel back and forth. After the liberation of Lüda, the Party and the People's Government, on the basis of the colonial city left by Japanese imperialism, implemented the policy of investing little, using key points, maintaining mainly, and fully exploiting the potential of existing equipment. In coordination with the restoration and development of the national economy, partial reconstruction and expansion of various public facilities were carried out. In terms of real estate work, three large-scale housing adjustments were carried out successively, allocating approximately 1.63 million square meters of housing, moving residents with extremely poor living conditions into houses with better living conditions; newly built 400,000 square meters of employee dormitories and 485,000 square meters of other public buildings, and renovated more than 18,500 public houses. As a result of these measures, the living area per capita for urban residents increased from an average of 1.1 square meters before liberation to 3.18 square meters, which played a certain role in alleviating the tense situation of employee housing shortages, developing the national economy, and consolidating national defense. However, our real estate work is still far behind the needs of national construction and the people. Due to the rapid recovery and development of the national economy after liberation, the urban population has increased year by year, especially the Ganjingzi industrial zone, which has developed more rapidly. Almost every year, factories and mines in this zone are expanding. Therefore, despite the great efforts made by relevant departments of the local government and some factories and mining enterprises to solve the problem of employee housing over the years, and some measures have been taken, the contradiction between housing demand and supply has continued to increase. In the past, we did not fully recognize the importance of correspondingly improving the material and cultural life of workers and staff, especially living conditions, on the basis of developing production, and we lacked regular and practical specific leadership in real estate work; we lacked comprehensive and detailed analysis and research on the needs and uses of houses; we lacked comprehensive planning and unified arrangement, unified management; we lacked effective measures and proactive steps to vigorously organize relevant departments and factories and mining enterprises to cooperate and coordinate, and mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized to solve the housing problem. Therefore, real estate work has always been in a passive and coping situation. According to statistics as of the end of March this year, there are still more than 11,000 employee households without housing. Among them, some people have settled their families in hotels, guest houses, and factory offices; many people are separated from their wives, living in collective dormitories or with relatives and friends; many families with three generations or two or three households living in one room are not uncommon; and there are even more people living in warehouses, bathhouses, basements, kitchens, and other places where they cannot see the sun all year round. As for those who apply for housing in preparation for marriage or wanting to bring their families, the number is increasing month by month. Many employees live too far from the factories, and some even need 3 hours to travel back and forth. This either shortens the time employees stay in the factory, affecting their ability to study culture and technology and attend necessary meetings, or it inevitably makes it difficult for employees to maintain sufficient rest time, affecting their health. At the same time, the transportation costs of factories and mining enterprises also increase, and the congestion of trams and buses is further aggravated. According to incomplete statistics, more than 15,000 households are still waiting for continued adjustment and relocation. Among them, there are more than 3,700 households of employees in the Ganjingzi industrial zone, which is more than ten kilometers away from the city center, who need to be adjusted and relocated to live near the Ganjingzi district. There are also more than 6,000 households of employees and residents living in dilapidated wooden houses on the outskirts of the city, and they must also be gradually relocated to other places, and the dilapidated houses must be demolished and rebuilt in a planned manner. In recent years, we have taken a considerable amount of funds from real estate rental income every year to renovate houses, and squeezed out a portion of funds to build some new employee dormitories. However, the house renovation projects are often of low quality, wasteful, and not timely. Sometimes, what should be repaired is not repaired, but what should not be repaired is repaired, and sometimes, what should be a minor repair is a major repair. The new employee dormitories built every year cannot be well implemented in accordance with the principles of suitability, economy, and aesthetics where possible. Often, due to the one-sided pursuit of reducing costs and expanding the usable area, and the lack of due attention to the engineering quality of simple buildings and bungalows by construction enterprises, the construction quality is low, making residents feel inconvenient to live in. As for rental management and the management of private real estate, there are also many shortcomings, which I will not go into detail here.
    1956 is a year of even greater upsurge in socialist construction and rapid development of socialist transformation. Vice Premier Li Fuchun announced at the plenary session of this conference on June 18 that the tasks set in the first Five-Year Plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. This is so exciting!
    In accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, our city must fully exploit the potential of the coastal industrial city, mobilize all forces that can be mobilized, actively support the industrial construction of the inland, and continue to strive to consolidate national defense in the magnificent national construction cause in the future. To this end, all undertakings and work must be based on a solid and reliable foundation, comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, comprehensively plan, strengthen leadership, and take proactive steps. Real estate work must also be the same. In view of the rapid development of the objective situation, after studying the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao's "Report on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," and criticizing right-leaning conservatism, we have initially formulated a plan for real estate work while planning the city's various tasks. In order to organize the implementation of the housing adjustment and new construction plans determined in the plan, we have absorbed the city's trade union and relevant departments and factories and mining enterprises to establish a Employee Housing New Construction and Adjustment Committee, and on the basis of continuing to conduct in-depth investigations and research on the housing situation of employees, we will take steady steps to organize housing adjustment work in a planned manner on the principles of employee voluntariness and beneficial to production, and concentrate on building some new employee dormitories near the industrial zone in stages, striving to basically change the unreasonable living conditions such as employees living too far from the factory within three years, and at the same time meet the housing requirements of some employees.
    However, to completely solve the problem of housing shortages throughout the city, it will take a considerable period of time and accumulate a considerable amount of funds. We estimate that by 1967, the population of the built-up area of Dalian will increase from 667,000 at the end of 1955 to 720,000. During this period, a total investment of more than 120 million yuan is needed to build 2.08 million square meters of new housing. Only in this way can we basically meet the housing needs of all households with housing shortages and enable urban residents to have an average living area of 4.5 square meters per person. Such a large amount of funds cannot be solved by relying solely on local real estate rental income. In addition to the local government drawing a considerable portion of funds from real estate rental income on the condition of ensuring the maintenance of houses, another portion must rely on investment from state-owned factories, local state-owned factories, universities, and secondary vocational schools under the relevant central departments, and most of it still relies on assistance from the central government and the province in investment. Regarding the issue of workers' housing, Vice Premier Li Xiannian told us in his report that the state is taking measures. This gives us increased confidence. In order to better cooperate with the rapid development of the national economy, we will actively work hard to accumulate funds from all aspects and strive to solve the contradiction between housing needs and supply as soon as possible. Here, I would like to make the following two suggestions:
    First, in order to comprehensively plan and rationally arrange the housing problem of employees, it is suggested that the relevant central departments allocate the investment for the construction of dormitories for employees and students of affiliated factories, mines, enterprises, and schools to the local government in a unified manner in the future, so as to achieve unified planning, unified design, unified construction, unified distribution, and unified management. Because doing so can save construction funds, save construction land, and make public facilities easier to arrange; it can reduce many troubles for factories, mines, enterprises, and schools in managing housing; it is convenient to arrange employee housing in a unified manner, making it more reasonable and reducing phenomena such as uneven distribution of benefits and hardships among factories and mines. Moreover, building houses under the guidance of the idea of unified planning will strengthen the integrity of the city, combine short-term construction with long-term planning, and combine local construction with overall construction, thereby making it more conducive to developing production and consolidating national defense. In the past few years, many state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines, as well as colleges and universities, have played an active role and built some employee housing and student dormitories on their own, which is beneficial to assisting the local government in solving housing difficulties. However, from the perspective of needs and possibilities today, the method mentioned earlier is much better than the "each doing their own thing" approach.
    Second, it is suggested that the relevant central departments approve the use of funds used by affiliated factories and mines and schools for the transportation of employees and teachers and students every year (according to incomplete statistics from some factories and mines, the annual transportation cost for employees is more than 510,000 yuan) as funds for building dormitories. We also require state-owned and local state-owned factories and mining enterprises to use enterprise bonus funds in a planned and focused manner according to the different welfare conditions of employees, and strive to concentrate more funds on building employee dormitories.
    The new employee dormitories and various non-productive buildings must be solid and practical in the future, and on the premise of ensuring the quality of the project, continue to pay attention to reducing costs, saving the use of raw materials, and using as little or no cement and steel as possible. In real estate work and urban construction work, we must also conscientiously do a good job in house renovation, rent adjustment, private house transformation, urban greening, maintenance and management of various public facilities, and planning and design. We are also taking measures for these.
    We deeply realize that the housing problem is one of the major problems that urgently need to be solved in current urban work. If the employee housing problem and other welfare problems are properly solved, the workers and staff will further enhance their enthusiasm and creativity, and more powerfully and deeply carry out the socialist labor competition - the advanced producer movement, thereby continuously increasing labor productivity and accelerating the country's socialist construction. There are many shortcomings in our work and very little experience, but we are determined to take prompt action under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and under the direct leadership of the Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, mobilize all positive factors, vigorously organize the cooperation and coordination of relevant departments, rely on the people of the whole city, and work hard to do a good job in real estate work and various urban construction tasks, so as to adapt to the rapid development of economic construction and the growing needs of the people's lives.

    旅大市的职工住宅问题
    ——乔传珏代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”、廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”和彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    李副总理在1955年国家决算的报告里所列举的数字生动地反映出我国人民过去一年中，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，在国家的社会主义建设与社会主义改造各个方面都取得了光辉灿烂的成就。李副总理代表国务院所提出的1956年国家预算，不论收入计划或支出计划都是很积极的。它是在稳妥可靠的基础上，加紧国家建设的预算；是反映社会主义高潮、争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的预算。毫无疑问，全国人民都将怀着兴奋鼓舞的心情，进行紧张的工作和创造性的劳动，为胜利地实现1956年的财政任务和各项建设任务而努力奋斗。
  李副总理在1956年国家预算的报告里，对人民生活也寄予了深切的关怀，就改善人民的物质和文化生活，宣布了一些有关的措施。我认为这些措施都是十分必要的，也是切实可行的。只有在工人阶级领导的国家里，劳动人民的生活福利问题才能得到政府及时的关心和重视。我相信国家在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上，所采取的逐步改善职工群众的物质文化生活和根据必要与可能的原则满足职工群众需要的各项措施，必将获得全体职工的热烈拥护。职工群众在社会主义的高潮中，必将进一步发挥劳动积极性，更多更快更好更省地发展生产，发展社会主义建设事业。李副总理在报告中对职工工资、生活福利和安全等问题所提出的批评也是符合于我们旅大市的实际情况的。在这里只想反映一些有关职工住宅的问题，希各位代表批评和指正！
    旅大市是一个旧有的沿海工业城市，也是一个国防前哨。工业主要集中在甘井子、沙河口两个区。房屋及其他公共设施大部分是敌伪统治时期修建的。城市建设的布局，可以说已经基本上定型。各种公共设施具有一定程度的现代化规模，但多集中在日本人曾经居住的地区，而很少分布到中国劳动人民聚居的地方，且设备陈旧，必须经常加强整修和养护。在敌伪统治时期，中国职工长年住在破漏、潮湿、阴暗的小房里，拥挤不堪，并且有许多职工住处离工厂很远，有的住处与工厂相距数十里，往返不便。旅大解放后，党与人民政府在日本帝国主义遗留下来的殖民地城市的基础上，贯彻投资不多、重点使用，以维护为主，充分发挥现有设备潜力的方针，配合着国民经济的恢复与发展，对各项公共设施，进行了部分的改建与扩建工作。在房产工作方面，先后进行了三次规模较大的住宅调整工作，分配房屋约163万平方公尺，将居住条件极端恶劣的居民，搬进了居住条件较好的房屋；新建职工宿舍40万平方公尺、其他公共建筑48.5万平方公尺，并整修公有房屋18，500余栋。由于采取这些措施，使城市居民的居住面积，由解放前平均每人1.1平方公尺增加到3.18平方公尺，对于缓和职工缺房的紧张情况，对于发展国民经济和巩固国防起了一定的作用。然而我们的房产工作还落在国家建设与人民群众需要的后面很远。由于解放后，国民经济的恢复与发展很快，城市人口逐年增多，特别是甘井子工业区的发展更为迅速，该区几乎每年都有厂矿从事扩建，因而尽管地方政府有关部门与某些厂矿企业，对解决职工住宅问题，历年都作出了很大的努力，采取了一些措施，但住宅的需求与供应之间的矛盾，仍是有增无减。我们在过去一个时期内，对在发展生产的基础上，相适应地改善职工群众的物质文化生活，尤其是居住条件的重要意义，还认识不够，对房产工作缺乏经常的、切实的具体领导；对房屋的需要与使用情况缺乏全面的、详尽的分析研究；缺乏全面规划与统一安排、统一管理；缺乏采取有效的措施和积极的步骤，大力组织有关部门与厂矿企业配合协作，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，来解决住宅问题，因而房产工作一直处于被动、应付的局面。截至今年3月底统计，尚有11，000余户职工无房居住。他们中间，有些人把家属安置在旅馆、招待所、工厂办公室里；有许多人同妻子分居，分别住在集体宿舍或亲友家里；老少三辈或两、三户挤居在一个房间的也不少；住在仓库、澡塘、地下室、厨房等处终年不见阳光的则更多。至于因准备结婚或想接来家眷而申请用房的更是逐月增加。许多职工住处离工厂过远，有些人甚至往返需要3小时。这样，不是使职工留厂时间缩短，影响职工学习文化技术和参加必要的会议，就势必使职工难以保持足够的休息时间而影响健康。同时，厂矿企业的交通费用也因之增加，电车、汽车的拥挤情形就越发加剧。据不完全统计，有15，000余户尚待于继续调整迁移。其中离市中心十几公里的甘井子工业区职工，需调整迁至甘井子区附近居住的即有3，700余户。市区的边沿地方还有6，000余户职工和居民住在破漏的木板房里，也必须逐步地把他们迁至别处，有步骤地将破房拆除另建。近几年来我们每年都从房地产租金收入中，拿出相当一部分资金，整修房屋，并挤出一部分资金，新建一些职工宿舍。但房屋的整修工程，往往是质量低，浪费大，且不及时，有时应修的未修，不应修的却修了，有时应小修的也大修了。每年新建的职工宿舍也不能很好地贯彻适用、经济和在可能条件下美观的原则。往往因为片面地追求降低造价和扩大使用面积，以及建筑企业对简易楼房和平房的工程质量缺乏应有的重视，致建筑质量低，使住户感到居住不便。至于租金管理和对私人房产的管理工作等，也都存在着许多缺点，这里就不多说了。
    1956年是社会主义建设更加高涨，社会主义改造迅速发展的一年。李富春副总理在6月18日本次大会全体会议上宣布：第一个五年计划中所提出的任务，将被提前完成和超额完成。这是多么令人振奋的事情！
    根据中共中央和国务院指示的精神，我市今后在宏伟的国家建设事业中，必须充分发挥沿海工业城市的潜力，调动一切可以调动的力量，积极地支援内地的工业建设并继续努力巩固国防。为此，各项事业和工作都必须在稳妥可靠的基础上，全面贯彻又多又快又好又省的方针，全面规划，加强领导，采取积极的步骤来进行。房产工作也必须如此。鉴于客观形势的迅速发展，我们在学习了中共中央六中全会的决议和毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，批判了右倾保守主义之后，在对市的各项工作进行规划的同时，对房产工作也初步地制定了规划。为组织实现规划中确定的房屋调整与新建计划，我们吸收市工会与有关部门、有关厂矿参加，成立了职工住宅新建与调整委员会，在继续深入调查研究职工居住情况的基础上，在职工自愿和有利于生产的原则下，采取稳妥的步骤，有计划地组织房屋调整工作并集中地在工业区附近，分期新建一些职工宿舍，争取在三年内基本上改变职工住处离厂过远等居住不合理的状况，同时满足部分职工对住宅的要求。
    但在全市范围内彻底解决缺房的问题，还需要经过相当长的时期，积聚相当多的一笔资金才能办到。我们推算到1967年大连建成区人口将由1955年底66.7万人增加到72万人。在这期间，总计需要投资12，000余万元，新建住宅208万平方公尺。这样才能基本上满足全部缺房户对住宅的需要，并使城市居民每人平均居住面积达到4.5平方公尺。这样多的资金，单纯依靠地方的房地产租金收入显然是不能解决的。除地方政府在保证搞好房屋维修的条件下，从房地产租金收入中抽出相当一部分资金而外，另一部分必须依靠国营厂矿、地方国营厂矿、高等学校和中央有关部门所属中等专业学校投资，大部分还有赖于中央和省在投资上给予援助。对于工人住宅问题，李先念副总理在报告里告诉我们，国家正在采取措施。这使我们增加信心，为了更好地配合国民经济的迅速发展，我们将积极努力，从各方面积聚资金，争取提早解决住宅的需要和供应之间的矛盾。在这里我提出以下两点建议：
    第一、为统盘筹划和合理安排职工居住问题，建议中央有关部今后分配给所属厂矿企业和学校修建职工及学生宿舍用的投资时，统一地拨给地方政府，以便统一规划、统一设计、统一施工、统一分配与统一管理。因为这样作，可以节约建设资金、节省建筑用地并使公共设施易于安排；可以减轻厂矿企业与学校管理住宅的许多麻烦；便于统一安排职工居住，使之趋于合理，减少厂矿之间苦乐不均等现象。而且在统一规划的思想指导下修建房屋，就会加强城市的完整性，使近期建设与远景规划结合起来，使局部建设与整体建设结合起来，从而更有利于发展生产和巩固国防。过去几年来许多国营和地方国营厂矿及大专学校曾发挥积极性，各自修建了一些职工住宅和学生宿舍，这对协助地方政府解决住宅困难是有好处的。但今天从需要与可能来看，采取前面讲的办法就比“各自为政”的做法好得多了。
    第二、建议中央有关部准予所属厂矿和学校将每年用于职工和教师、学生交通方面的经费（据部分厂矿不完全统计，每年职工交通费达51万元以上），充作修建宿舍的资金。我们并要求国营与地方国营厂矿企业，根据职工生活福利的不同情况，有计划有重点地使用企业奖励基金，争取更多地把资金集中地使用在修建职工宿舍上面。
    今后新建的职工宿舍和各种非生产性建筑必须坚固和实用，并在保证工程质量的前提下，继续注意降低造价，节约使用原材料，尽量不用或少用水泥和钢材。在房产工作和城市建设工作中，还必须认真做好房屋整修、租金调整、私房改造、城市绿化、各种公共设施的维修管理及规划设计等工作。对于这些，我们也都正在采取措施。
    我们深深体会到住宅问题是目前城市工作中亟待解决的重大问题之一。妥善地解决了职工住宅问题及其他生活福利问题，职工群众就会进一步发挥积极性和创造性，更有力、更深入地开展社会主义劳动竞赛——先进生产者运动，从而不断地提高劳动生产率，加速国家的社会主义建设。我们工作中缺点甚多，经验又很少，但我们有决心在中共中央和国务院的领导下，在辽宁省委和省人民委员会的直接领导下，迅速行动起来，调动一切积极因素，大力组织有关部门的配合协作，依靠全市人民，努力做好房产工作及各项城市建设工作，以适应经济建设的飞跃发展与人民生活日益增长的需要。
