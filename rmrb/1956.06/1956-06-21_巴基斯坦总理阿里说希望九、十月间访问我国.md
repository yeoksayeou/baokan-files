Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, June 20th - Prime Minister Ali told reporters yesterday that he hoped to visit China in September or October.

Ali was speaking after returning to Karachi yesterday after a two-week rest in Quetta. He told reporters that the establishment of the Republican Party would not affect his government because "the Republicans say they support me." He said that the Republicans were almost all members who had left the Muslim League.

Ali also said that he would visit France in the second week of July on his way back home after attending the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.
