To the Editor:

    The Sixth Branch of the Dawn Agricultural Cooperative in Xinfan Township, Muchuan County, Sichuan Province, was established last December and has 50 member households. The cooperative's president, Cai Mingshui (a Communist Party member), has a very undemocratic work style and treats cooperative members very rudely, which has seriously affected their enthusiasm.
    In early March of this year, a farmer outside the cooperative lost a small item. Cai Mingshui, after listening to certain individuals, believed that Li Guizhen from the cooperative's Third Production Team had stolen it. On the evening of March 10th, he convened a meeting of the Third Team members, demanding that Li Guizhen confess. When Li Guizhen explained that she had not taken anyone's things, Cai Mingshui said she was being dishonest and punished her by making her kneel on a bench. Li Guizhen was so frightened at the time that she was willing to "compensate" for the item. Cai Mingshui still believed she was not being honest and made her kneel until midnight.
    In mid-March, Cai Mingshui again violated the law and discipline by expelling female cooperative member Zhao Bihua from the cooperative and placing restrictions on her production. Zhao Bihua's former husband was a counter-revolutionary who had been suppressed, but she herself had not engaged in any counter-revolutionary activities. After the land reform, she married farmer Guo Jicheng; last year, both of them joined the cooperative. The cooperative implemented a system of fixed basic scores with flexible assessment. Zhao Bihua reported her basic score as five points at the team meeting, and the team assessed it as five and a half points, but Cai Mingshui subjectively changed it to four and a half points. Zhao Bihua inquired with the cooperative committee about the reason but received no reply. Therefore, one evening she did her work and then defiantly refused the work points. Consequently, Cai Mingshui accused her of "being a family member of a former counter-revolutionary who, in the agricultural cooperative, disobeys leadership and sabotages production," and arbitrarily announced her punishment at a general meeting of cooperative members.
    Cai Mingshui's commandist and illegal and undisciplined bad work style has been consistent. In the past, he has also made several mistakes of tying up and escorting farmers. Currently, none of the members of this cooperative are not afraid of Cai Mingshui. In the cooperative, whatever he says goes. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of the members is very low, with only about 50% of the total members participating in work. The cooperative's agricultural and sideline production plans also cannot be completed. We request that the local Party and government leading organs promptly and seriously handle Cai Mingshui's illegal behavior. Only in this way can this cooperative be run well.

### 蔡明水是个坏社长

    蔡明水是个坏社长编辑同志：
    四川省沐川县新繁乡曙光农业社六分社，是去年十二月份办起来的，共有社员五十户。这个社的社长蔡明水（共产党员）作风很不民主，对待社员的态度非常粗暴，以致严重影响了社员的积极性。
    今年三月初，社外一个农民丢了一件小东西。蔡明水听了个别人的话，认为是社里第三生产队李贵珍偷的，就在三月十日晚上召开三队队员会议，要李贵珍坦白。李贵珍说明她并没有拿别人的东西，蔡明水就说她不老实，罚她跪在板凳上。李贵珍当时吓得愿意“赔偿”这件东西。蔡明水还是认为她不老实，让她一直跪到半夜。
    三月中旬，蔡明水又违法乱纪地将女社员赵碧华开除出社，管制生产。赵碧华原来的丈夫是一个已被镇压的反革命分子，但是她自己没有任何反革命行动。土地改革以后，她又和农民郭继成结了婚；去年，两人都入了社。这个社实行的是死分活评的办法，赵碧华在小队会上自报的底分是五分，队上评成五分半，但是蔡明水却主观地改成四分半。赵碧华向社委会查问原因，也得不到答复。因此，她有一天晚上干了活就赌气不要工分。于是，蔡明水就对她加上“原来是反革命分子家属，在农业社又不服从领导，破坏生产”的罪名，擅自在社员大会上宣布了对她的处分。
    蔡明水这种强迫命令、违法乱纪的恶劣作风是一贯的，过去也几次犯过捆押农民的错误。目前，这个社的社员没有一个不怕蔡明水的。社里不管什么事情，他说怎么办就怎么办。因此，社员的生产积极性很低，出工社员才占全体社员的50％左右。社里的农、副业生产计划也完不成。我们要求当地党、政领导机关迅速对蔡明水这种违法行为进行严肃处理，只有这样，才能使这个合作社办好。
