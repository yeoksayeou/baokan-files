I agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," and Secretary-General Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in his report that "in terms of local finance, in addition to appropriately increasing the growth rate of local budgets in this year's national budget to take care of local needs, preparations are also being made to appropriately expand local authority and flexibility in financial management, so that local areas can arrange their own revenue and expenditure according to local actual conditions within the controlled figures of the total budget." In the past, the central finance department exercised excessive and overly detailed control over local finance, which affected the initiative and enthusiasm of local financial work. Many tasks could not be carried out due to limited funding. Now the central government has noticed this problem, and "some specific solutions will be put forward soon." I believe this will be very helpful for doing a good job in local work in the future.

I have been working in Zhejiang for five years and have always paid considerable attention to the protection of cultural relics. Now I would like to put forward some opinions and suggestions on cultural relics protection work.
The Party and the government have always attached importance to the protection of cultural relics.
The Party and the government have always attached importance to the protection of cultural relics. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to rescue a collection of Jin Dynasty (12th century) Buddhist scriptures hidden in a Buddhist temple in Zhaocheng County, Shanxi, even the lives of Eighth Route Army soldiers were sacrificed. In Taoxi Town, Xuanping County, Zhejiang, there is a Yuan Dynasty wooden structure building - the Main Hall of Yanfu Temple. On the eve of liberation, a guerrilla team led by the local Communist Party protected it from being destroyed by the enemy, so that this rare ancient wooden structure building in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was preserved. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the central and local people's governments have promulgated a series of policies and laws to protect cultural relics. Not only have the precious cultural relics that have already been discovered been protected, but also a large number of cultural relics have continued to be discovered. According to incomplete statistics, more than 219,200 cultural relics (not counting scattered pottery shards) have been unearthed from ancient cultural sites and ancient tombs across the country in the past six years. In Zhejiang alone, from 1953 to the present, a total of 25 Neolithic sites or remains have been discovered, distributed in 15 cities and counties. Many important cultural relics have been found in these sites. For example, in 1953, Song Dynasty wooden figurines that had never been discovered in China were found in Laohe Mountain in Hangzhou, breaking the traditional saying that "there were no figurines in the Song Dynasty"; recently, objects woven with bamboo strips were found in the Qianshanyang Neolithic site in Wuxing County, proving that our ancestors at that time already knew how to use bamboo strips to weave tools such as baskets. Due to insufficient publicity of the policies on cultural relics protection, incidents of damage to cultural relics often occur.
However, on the other hand, due to the fact that cultural departments at all levels have not publicized and implemented the policies and laws on cultural relics protection widely and deeply enough, and cultural relics knowledge has not been popularized, incidents of damage to cultural relics often occur. The most common example is treating valuable ancient books as waste paper and sending them to paper mills for pulp; treating valuable ancient bronzes as scrap metal and sending them to smelting plants. For example, from September 1954 to January of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture recovered 2,207 historical and revolutionary cultural relics from scrap copper, including extremely valuable Shang and Zhou bronzes, bronze badges from the Central Military and Political School (Whampoa Military Academy) during the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation in 1924, and copper coins from the Wanxi Workers and Peasants Democratic Government period. More than 2,530 catties of valuable books and materials were recovered from more than 20,000 catties of waste paper, totaling 10,440 volumes, including about 1,600 ancient books, about 3,000 family trees, and medical books, local chronicles, etc. This batch of waste paper was purchased by a cooperative in Suian County, Zhejiang, and transported to Shanghai for papermaking. Let me give another example: About half a year ago, a colleague from the Zhejiang Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee told me that the committee had sent someone to an organization that purchased waste paper to carry out screening work. They found some useful ancient books and told them that in the future, when waste paper was purchased, they must first notify the Cultural Relics Management Committee, and only after the committee had screened it could it be sent to the paper mill. They agreed to it in person, but behind their backs they notified the acquisition agencies in the counties and districts below, telling them to tear up all the old books they acquired before packing them, with the intention of making it impossible for the Cultural Relics Management Committee to carry out screening. This example shows that we have done too poorly in the publicity and education of cultural relics protection policies in the past, and cultural relics knowledge is not popular enough. Incidents of destroying ancient sites and damaging steles have also occurred frequently in the past. For example, the Northern Wei stone Buddha statues in Ziyang County, Shandong, and the Tang Dynasty steles in front of the ancient pagoda of Xinglong Temple have been damaged. Another example is that Hangzhou has a stone scripture from the Southern Song Dynasty, which has high historical value. The Qing scholar Qian Daxin mentioned it several times in his "Ten Chariots Together Nourishing New Records." After liberation, because the cultural relics management agency did not pay attention to it, part of it was used to pave roads. By the time it was discovered and protected, it had already suffered considerable damage. Here is another example: There has always been a Qian Wang Temple on West Lake in Hangzhou, which is dedicated to Qian Liu, the king of Wuyue during the Five Dynasties. After liberation, because the temple had been in disrepair for many years, the relevant departments considered repairing it and specially held a symposium to discuss it. At the meeting, some people advocated demolishing it, on the grounds that Qian Liu was a feudal separatist warlord and had also fought against Huang Chao's peasant uprising army, making him a counter-revolutionary. Since then, the relevant parties have no longer considered this issue, neither repairing it nor protecting it properly, allowing it to collapse. Recently, it has been demolished, leaving only a temple base. In fact, Qian Liu was relatively good among the feudal separatist warlords of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. At the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty, people in Kaifeng said, "Above there is paradise, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou," which fully illustrates the merits of Qian Liu and his descendants in implementing a policy of protecting the territory and the people, vigorously building water conservancy projects, and developing agricultural production during the seventy to eighty years. Leaving such a temple on West Lake is not entirely meaningless. This also includes the correct evaluation of historical figures. I think their evaluation of Qian Liu did not view the issue from a historical perspective, and therefore it is wrong.

Based on the above-mentioned situations, I deeply feel that the "Notice on Protecting Cultural Relics in Agricultural Production and Construction" issued by the State Council on April 2 this year is very timely and important. The notice emphasizes that a comprehensive survey of historical and revolutionary cultural relics and sites should be carried out throughout the country. I hope that the cultural bureaus of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government will attach importance to this notice and implement it.
Some Suggestions for Future Cultural Relics Work

In order to do a good job in future cultural relics work, I would like to put forward the following suggestions for the reference of relevant departments:

First, in terms of training and enriching cadres: (1) The history departments of comprehensive universities should establish archeology majors, which should be planned by the Archeology Department of Peking University and the Institute of Archeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and realized within the period of the Second Five-Year Plan. (2) Continue to hold short-term archeology training courses and select outstanding young people to participate in the study. (3) The cultural bureaus of each province and city should have full-time cadres familiar with cultural relics business; the cultural bureaus of provinces and cities should set up cultural relics sections; the authorized size of local cultural relics management committees and museums should be increased. (4) It is certainly necessary to train talents in field archeology, but it is also necessary to train specialized talents in identifying various cultural relics such as calligraphy and paintings, inscriptions, versions, coins, seals, etc., because the older generation of experts is decreasing day by day, and if the next generation is not trained, there is a danger of disconnection. (5) The law-abiding merchants who originally dealt in antiques, calligraphy and paintings, and inscriptions, many of whom have considerable identification capabilities, can greatly play a role after socialist transformation. The cultural bureaus, cultural relics management committees, and museums of various provinces and cities should conduct investigations and planning, and let them participate in cultural relics protection work. (6) The cultural bureaus, cultural relics management committees, and museums of various provinces and cities should train and cultivate cultural relics work cadres for various counties and districts, and include this work in their business plans. (7) The Ministry of Culture should take measures to improve the professional level of middle and upper-level cultural relics work cadres in various provinces and cities, such as arranging them to visit and study in Beijing or typical archeological work areas in batches.

Second, regarding the maintenance and restoration of ancient buildings: (1) There are a large number of ancient buildings across the country. In Europe, buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries are already very precious, but we regard buildings from the Ming Dynasty as very ordinary. This is obviously wrong. I think Ming Dynasty buildings should be protected, and representative buildings from the Qing Dynasty before the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom should also be protected. (2) There are Buddhist pagodas everywhere in our country, which not only adorn the scenery, but also have historical value and should be protected. Some have already collapsed but are of particular historical value and have always been loved by the people, such as the Bao'en Temple Pagoda in Nanjing and the Leifeng Pagoda on West Lake in Hangzhou. In the future, the possibility of reconstruction will have to be considered.

Protecting cultural relics is not only the responsibility of cultural relics management departments, but all local cultural and educational departments, agricultural production departments, engineering construction departments, and grassroots mass organizations have a responsibility. The urgent measures at present, in addition to carrying out a comprehensive survey nationwide, should vigorously promote and carry out mass cultural relics protection work in agricultural production and construction. This point has also been pointed out in the recent notice issued by the State Council.

### 我对文物保护工作的意见和建议——宋云彬代表的发言

    我对文物保护工作的意见和建议
    ——宋云彬代表的发言
    我同意李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，同意廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”和彭真秘书长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。李先念副总理的报告中指出，“在地方财政方面，除了在本年国家预算中已经适当地增大地方预算的增长率，照顾地方的需要以外，还准备适当地扩大地方在财政管理上的权限和机动性，使地方在预算总额的控制数字以内，能够根据当地实际情况安排自己的收支”。过去中央财政对于地方财政的确管得过多过细，影响了地方财政工作的主动性和积极性，有许多工作往往因为限于经费不能展开。现在中央已经注意到这个问题，“不久就可以提出一些具体的解决办法”，我相信对于今后做好地方工作是很有帮助的。
    我在浙江工作已经五个年头了，平时对于文物保护工作相当注意，现在就文物保护工作方面提出一些意见和建议。党和政府一直重视文物保护工作
    党和政府一直重视文物保护工作。在抗日战争时期，为了抢救一部藏在山西赵城县佛寺里的金代
  （十二世纪）藏经，甚至于牺牲了八路军战士的生命。我们浙江宣平县桃溪镇有一座元代的木结构建筑物——延福寺正殿，在解放前夕，由当地一支共产党领导的游击队予以保护，不让敌人破坏，使得这座长江下游极少见的古代木结构建筑物保存下来。中华人民共和国成立以来，中央和地方人民政府颁布了一系列的保护文物的政策和法令，不但已经发现的珍贵文物得到保护，并且继续发现了大批文物。据不完全的统计，六年来从各地的古文化遗址和古墓葬中清理出来的文物有219，200件之多（零星的陶片不计算在内）。单就我们浙江来说，从1953年起到目前为止，发现的新石器时代遗址或遗存共25处，分布15个市县。在那些遗址中发现不少重要的文物。例如1953年在杭州老和山发现国内从未发现过的宋代木俑，打破了“宋代无俑”的传统说法；最近在吴兴县钱山漾新石器时代遗址中发现用篾编织的东西，证明那时候咱们的先人已经懂得用篾来编织筐子一类的用具了。由于对文物保护政策宣传不够，也常常发生破坏文物事件
    但是，在另一方面，由于过去各级文化部门对文物保护的政策法令宣传得不够普遍深入，文物知识也没有能够普及，常常发生破坏文物的事件。最普遍的例子是把名贵的古书当作废纸，送给造纸厂作纸浆；把名贵的古铜器当作金属废品，送进了冶炼厂。例如上海市文化局从1954年9月到今年1月，从废铜当中检出了历史文物和革命文物2，207件，其中有极宝贵的商周铜器和1924年国共合作时期的中央军事政治学校（黄埔军校）的铜质证章以及皖西工农民主政府时期的铜币等。从两万多斤的废纸当中检出有价值的图书资料2，530斤，共10，440册，其中古籍约1，600册，家谱约3，000册，还有医书、方志等等。这批废纸是我们浙江遂安县合作社收购来运到上海去做纸浆的。让我再举一个例子：大约半年以前，浙江省文管会一位工作同志告诉我，文管会曾经派人到一个收购废纸的机构去做检选工作，检出了一些有用的古书，就告诉他们，以后收购到废纸，必须先通知文管会，经文管会检选以后才送进造纸厂去。他们当面答应了，背后却又通知下面县、区的收购机构，叫他们以后把收购来的旧书统统拆散撕破了才打包，其用意在使文管会无法进行检选。这个例子说明了我们过去对文物保护政策的宣传教育工作做得太差，文物知识也不够普及。破坏古迹、毁损碑碣等事件过去也常常发生。例如山东滋阳县北魏石佛造像和兴隆寺古塔前面的唐代碑碣都曾经遭受破坏。又如我们杭州有南宋的石经，历史价值很高，清儒钱大昕在他的“十驾齐养新录”里几次提到它，解放后因为文物保管机构对它不加注意，一部分被用来铺路，等到发觉而加以保护的时候，已经遭受到相当的损害了。再举一个例子：杭州西湖上一向有个钱王祠，是祭祀五代吴越国王钱鏐的。解放以后，因为这个祠堂年久失修，有关部门曾经考虑加以修葺，特地开座谈会讨论，会上有人主张把它拆掉，其理由是钱鏐是个封建割据的军阀，又打过黄巢的农民起义军，是个反革命。从此有关方面就不再考虑这个问题，既不修葺，也不好好保护，让它坍下去，最近已经拆毁，只剩一个祠基了。其实钱鏐在五代十国的封建割据军阀当中是比较好的。北宋初年开封人说“上有天堂，下有苏杭”，充分说明了钱鏐和他的后裔在七八十年当中实行保境安民政策，大力兴修水利，发展农业生产的功绩，西湖上留着这么一个祠堂，不是全无意义的。这里面还包含着对历史人物的正确评价问题。我认为他们对钱鏐的那种评价不是从历史上看问题的，因而是错误的。
    根据上述的种种情况，我深切感觉到今年4月2日国务院发出的“关于在农业生产建设中保护文物的通知”非常及时而重要。通知里着重指出要在全国范围内对历史和革命文物遗迹进行普遍调查，我希望各省、自治区、直辖市文化局重视这个通知，予以贯彻执行。对今后文物工作的几点建议
    为了做好今后的文物工作，我提出下面的几点建议，供有关部门参考：
    第一，关于培养和充实干部方面：（一）综合大学的历史系应该设立考古专业，由北京大学考古专业和科学院考古研究所负责规划，于第二个五年计划期内实现。（二）继续举办短期的考古训练班，抽调优秀青年参加学习。
  （三）各省市文化局应该有熟悉文物业务的专职干部；省市文化局应该设文物科；各地文管会和博物馆的编制名额应该增加。（四）田野考古人材固然要培养，鉴别各项文物如字画、碑帖、版本、钱币、印章等等的专门人材也要培养，因为老一辈的专家日见减少，不培养下一辈，就有脱节的危险。（五）原来经营古董、字画、碑帖的守法的商人，其中很多是具有相当鉴别能力，经过社会主义改造，可以大大发挥作用的，各省市文化局、文管会和博物馆应该进行调查，并加以规划，让他们参加文物保护工作。（六）各省市文化局，文管会和博物馆应该替各县、区训练和培养文物工作干部，并且把这一项工作列入业务计划。（七）中央文化部应该对提高各省市中上级文物工作干部的业务水平方面有所措施，例如分批调来北京或考古工作典型地区参观、学习。
    第二，关于古建筑物的保养和修复方面：（一）全国范围内的古建筑是非常多的。在欧洲，十七八世纪的建筑物已经非常宝贵，而我们却把明代的建筑物看得极平常。这显然是不对的。我认为明代建筑物应该保护，清代太平天国以前的有代表性的建筑物也应该保护。（二）我国到处有佛塔，不但点缀风景，而且具有历史价值，应该加以保护。有已经坍掉而特别具有历史价值、一向为人民所喜爱的如南京报恩寺塔、杭州西湖的雷峰塔，将来还得考虑重建。
    保护文物不仅仅是文物管理部门的事情，所有地方文化教育部门、农业生产部门、工程建设部门和基层群众团体等都有责任。目前的紧要措施，除了在全国范围内进行普遍调查工作以外，应该大力宣传，在农业生产建设中开展群众性的文物保护工作。这一点，最近国务院发出的通知里也已经给指出来了。
