Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 13th. At the Czechoslovak Communist Party National Conference on June 11th, Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, delivered a report on the current situation and the tasks of the party.

In his report, Novotný said that the mission and main task of the Party's National Conference is to arouse and mobilize all the forces of the Party and the people to complete the socialist construction of Czechoslovakia. Facts clearly prove that the general line laid down by the Party's Tenth Congress in June 1954 is now, and will continue to be, correct, and there is nothing in it that needs to be revised. This general line has been basically correctly and smoothly implemented. The situation before the National Conference also shows that the working people of Czechoslovakia agree with the Party's general line and are determined to fight for its realization.

Novotný spoke about the international situation and Czechoslovakia's foreign policy. He emphasized that Czechoslovakia will continue to strengthen its peaceful efforts and remain vigilant against all those who want to undermine the hope of eliminating war.

When talking about domestic issues, Novotný criticized excessive centralization, which has caused a considerable degree of bureaucracy in state and economic institutions. He emphasized the need to change the entire leadership and administrative system, abolish unnecessary administrative institutions, consistently pay attention to simplifying institutions, and other measures.

Novotný said that the Party Central Committee proposed that, starting from October 1st of this year, the working hours of adult workers and young workers should be gradually reduced to 46 hours and 36 hours per week, respectively. These measures arise from the Central Committee's decision to gradually implement a seven-hour workday within the Five-Year Plan.

Novotný also talked about continuing to increase the participation of workers and peasants in state management as the main direction for strengthening Czechoslovakia's socialist democracy.

He also talked about the tasks of the security organs and procuratorial organs. He said that the measures to be submitted to the National Conference are aimed at strengthening the educational tasks of these state organs and ensuring the inviolability of the socialist legal system.

When talking about Party building, Novotný said that the Party has strengthened its leadership role, has become closer to the people, and has undoubtedly won the further trust of the people. He said that it is necessary to pay more attention to the Party's development and the adjustment of its social composition. The Central Committee believes that it is currently necessary to prioritize the admission of workers and peasants into the Party.

In his report, he pointed out that the basic guideline of ideological work is to try to closely link ideological work with the practice of socialist construction.

Novotný concluded by saying that we will continue to develop and consolidate friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries.

    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议上
    诺沃提尼报告目前形势和党的任务
    新华社布拉格13日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼六月十一日在捷共全国代表会议上作了关于目前形势和党的任务的报告。
    诺沃提尼在报告中说，党的全国代表会议的使命和主要任务是唤起和动员党和人民的一切力量来完成捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设。事实清楚地证明，1954年6月党的第十次代表大会所规定的总路线现在是、并且将来仍然是正确的，其中没有什么需要修改。这个总路线基本上已经正确地和顺利地执行了。代表会议以前的局势也表明，捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民同意党的总路线，并且坚决为实现这个路线而斗争。
    诺沃提尼谈到了国际局势和捷克斯洛伐克的外交政策。他强调说，捷克斯洛伐克将继续加强它的和平努力，并且对一切想要破坏消除战争的希望的人保持警惕。
    在谈到国内问题的时候，诺沃提尼批评了过份的集中制，这种过份的集中制已经造成了国家和经济机构的相当大程度的官僚主义。他强调有必要改变整个领导和行政管理制度，废除不必要的行政机构，一贯地注意简化机构以及其他措施。
    诺沃提尼说，党中央委员会建议从今年十月一日起，把成年工人和青年工人的工时分别逐步减少到每周四十六小时和三十六小时。这些措施是由于中央委员会关于在五年计划内逐步实行七小时工作日的决定而产生的。
    诺沃提尼还谈到要继续不断地增加工人和农民参加国家管理作为加强捷克斯洛伐克社会主义民主的主要方向。
    他还谈到了保安机关和检察机关的任务。他说，将要提交给代表会议的措施的目的在于加强这些国家机关的教育任务和保证社会主义法制的不可侵犯。
    诺沃提尼在谈到党的建设的时候说，党已经加强了它的领导作用，已经变得更加接近人民，而且已经毫无疑问地赢得了人民进一步的信任。他说，有必要对党的发展和社会成分的调整给予更多的注意，中央委员会认为，目前有必要首先接收工人和农民入党。
    他在报告中指出，思想工作的基本方针是设法使思想工作和社会主义建设的实践密切地联系起来。
    诺沃提尼最后说，我们将继续发展和巩固同苏联和所有社会主义国家的友谊和联盟。
