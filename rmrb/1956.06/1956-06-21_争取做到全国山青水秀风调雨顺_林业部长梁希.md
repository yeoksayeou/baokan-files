Strive for a National Landscape of Green Mountains, Clear Waters, Favorable Weather
    —Forestry Minister Liang Xi

    National Afforestation Plan Completed Ahead of Schedule and Exceeded—Achievements and Shortcomings of the Forest Industry—Improve Mountain Area Production Planning—Thoroughly Eliminate Forest Fires—Earnestly Care for the Special Interests of Ethnic Minorities in Forest Areas—Establish Forestry Work Stations on a District Basis—Complete the Twelve-Year Greening Plan as Scheduled

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation on the draft model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Now, I would like to introduce the situation of forestry and the forest industry and put forward some suggestions on forestry for the future. I welcome criticism and guidance from the representatives.

I.

Since the second half of last year, in the upsurge of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country, forestry and the forest industry have also greatly developed and improved.

First, let's talk about forestry:

1.  Afforestation: Due to the great victory of the agricultural collectivization movement, the Party Central Committee's call to green the motherland, the attention paid to forestry by Party and government leaders at all levels, and especially the promotion of the Youth League Central Committee's Youth Afforestation Conference in Yan'an, which was attended by representatives from all over the country in five provinces (regions), a vigorous and fiery greening movement was launched throughout the country this spring.

According to my inspection in Zhejiang and Gansu provinces in May and June, more than 12 million people in Zhejiang Province received greening education, accounting for more than 50% of the province's population, and more than 4.3 million people participated in afforestation, accounting for about 20% of the province's population, of which more than 2 million were young people. In Gansu Province, 5.5 million people participated in afforestation, accounting for 41.2% of the province's population, of which 2 million were young people. What is particularly worth pointing out is the story of the mass voluntary afforestation on the north and south mountains of Lanzhou: As everyone knows, Lanzhou is an arid area with an annual rainfall of only 300 mm. To plant a tree, 60 jin of ice needs to be placed around it to replace watering. From March 1st to 15th this year, more than 176,000 laborers transported ice back and forth from the Yellow River to the mountains 5 to 25 li away, irrigating more than 1.7 million trees.

In short, greening combined with patriotism and love for one's hometown has become the action slogan of the broad masses of people everywhere. From the countryside to the city, from the army to the school, from government agencies to enterprises and mines, men and women, old and young, have been mobilized, and countless shock brigades have emerged, creating countless youth forests, children's forests, Young Pioneer forests, mother's forests, March 8th forests, August 1st forests, and even elderly forests.

In this way, as of June 12th, national afforestation reached 4.19 million hectares, completing the 1956 task, which is more than 3.5 times the afforestation area in the same period in 1955. Adding the afforestation area of 3.98 million hectares in the three years from 1953 to 1955, a total of more than 8.17 million hectares have been afforested. The total afforestation plan for the first five years was 6.29 million hectares, so we have completed the five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceeded it by 30%.

However, the above is about quantity, not quality. In terms of quality, this year will not be much higher than in previous years. This is reflected in the survival rate of afforestation. In 1955, the national average survival rate was only 64%. Although forestry workers have been generally trained this year, technical guidance is far from keeping up with the needs of the situation. It is estimated that when the survival rate is checked this autumn, it will not be able to reach the 90% required at the national forestry conference last year.

2.  Forest Protection and Fire Prevention: In the provinces within the customs, where forest fires have always been serious, thanks to the efforts of Party and government at all levels and the broad masses of people, forest fires have obviously decreased this year. In Gansu, the number of mountain fires this spring decreased by 92% compared with last year, and the area of forest destroyed decreased by 68%; in Yunnan, the number of fires from January to March decreased by 50% compared with the same period last year, the affected area decreased by 67%, and the loss of trees decreased by 72%. Other provinces such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Fujian, and Jiangxi have also seen varying degrees of reduction.

However, in Inner Mongolia and the Northeast, where our timber reserves are located, a major fire suddenly broke out in May this year. On the 25th, 26th, and 27th, 21 mountain fires were discovered in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains. 33,700 people were mobilized to fight the fires. Some fires were extinguished, while some continued to burn until June 4th before being extinguished by rain. The detailed number of losses in this fire is being investigated, and it is estimated that a considerable amount of grassland and forest must have been burned. The facts tell us that we must put in even greater efforts to prevent mountain fires.

3.  Forest Management: In key forest areas across the country, such as Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang provinces (regions), 42 intermediate forest management agencies led by the provincial forestry departments have been established, along with 352 grassroots forest management agencies (i.e., management stations), staffed with 8,335 people, managing more than 12.5 million hectares of state-owned forests. These forests will be gradually and rationally managed by us.

However, some staff members cannot play their due role because there are no roads or communication equipment in the forest; some technical cadres, although they graduated from senior schools and received more than four months of training in Beijing, are "cold-stored" after being assigned to work, and their work is not properly arranged.

Secondly, let's talk about the forest industry:

1.  Logging and Transportation Industry: In the state-owned forests of the Northeast and Inner Mongolia, large-scale enterprises have been formed and are using modern technology and equipment. In 1955, the economic accounting system for work teams was implemented, advanced experience exchange meetings were held, and socialist labor competitions were launched, resulting in an unprecedented new atmosphere. The production cost of logs decreased by 7.25% compared with 1954. The average annual output per production worker was 113.67 cubic meters, and labor productivity increased by 2.04 times compared with 1952. In terms of the proportion of mechanized production, at the end of 1955, timber collection reached 5.28%, timber transportation to intermediate storage yards reached 20.84%, and timber transportation to final storage yards reached 85.08%.

2.  Sawmilling Industry and Forest Chemical Industry: Due to improvements in production technology, operations, and equipment, the utilization rate of equipment in sawmills and forest chemical factories has increased. In the first quarter of this year, sawmill output exceeded the production plan by 101.38%, and forest chemical output exceeded the output value plan by 102.91%.

3.  Timber Market Sales: In the first quarter of this year, 1,925,724 cubic meters were sold on the market, an increase of 49.4% compared with the same period last year.

Although the above has achieved some results, there are still many shortcomings, the most prominent of which are:

1.  In the logging and transportation industry, the backward seasonal production methods still account for a considerable proportion; the mechanized production process lacks comprehensive planning, so the mechanical equipment in each production process is unbalanced, and a lot of machinery is idle; the labor organization is not reasonable, and the comprehensive output of wood per worker per day is only 0.34 cubic meters, which is nearly three times less than the 0.9 cubic meters in the Soviet Union in 1954; labor protection is not good enough, and work-related accidents are still very serious.

2.  The development of the sawmilling industry and the forest chemical industry has not been well coordinated with the logging and transportation industry, and is far behind the needs of the national economy. The utilization rate of timber and other forest products is very low. The amount of timber discarded in logging sites and timber processing plants every year is almost equal to or even exceeds the output of logs produced by logging, resulting in great losses.

3.  In timber sales, the quantity and specifications cannot meet the needs of farmers in rural areas.

II.

Some suggestions on forestry for the future. Now that the forest industry has been separated into a separate ministry, I will not make any suggestions in this regard. I will only raise a few issues regarding forestry:

1.  Land Reclamation Issues: Minister Liao Luyan said in his explanation on the draft model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives that many agricultural production cooperatives in many places only emphasize agricultural production and ignore forestry, which accounts for a large proportion of farmers' income. Yes, I also got such examples during my inspection in Zhejiang. Many cooperatives often pursue increased grain production at all costs. Only in places where the Party takes care, the mountains and forests are spared from disaster. For example, Fuhu Township in Kaihua County has organized 170 laborers and planned to reclaim land on the mountains for two months, but was discovered and stopped by the county party committee. In places where the county party committee cannot take care of, some reclaim mountains to grow grain, such as 12,000 mu of mountain slopes above 30 degrees on Nanjieshan Island in Xiangshan County were reclaimed to grow sweet potatoes; some destroy forests to grow grain, such as 1,500 mu of oil tea in Chengguan District of Tangxi County were completely cut down by a labor reform farm in Longyou to grow corn.

As everyone knows, land reclamation will cause soil erosion. According to experiments by the soil and water conservation station in Tianshui County, Gansu, the amount of soil erosion per hectare of land is 381.8 kilograms in wheat fields with a slope of 26 degrees 45 minutes, while in black locust forest land (without ground cover) with a slope of 29 degrees 33 minutes, only 76.8 kilograms are eroded, i.e., 100 to 20.

Soil erosion easily leads to flash floods. Every province in China has one or several untamed rivers, and untamed rivers originate from mountains without trees. As the saying goes:

"Reclaim land on the mountains, and disaster will strike below."

How to prevent land reclamation and prevent soil erosion? We believe that only by improving mountain area production planning, especially by making plans for the rational use of land, and resolving the contradictions between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, can we point out a beautiful vision for the masses and prevent them from recklessly reclaiming mountain land.

Now, according to the instructions of the State Council, the Ministry of Forestry, together with relevant departments, has formed a Mountain Area Production Planning Office under the leadership of the Seventh Office of the State Council. It is hoped that the people's committees of various localities will also strengthen their leadership over mountain area production planning, rationally divide the land in mountain areas that is suitable for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, vigorously maintain soil and water, and ensure agricultural production.

2.  Forest Fire Issues: Forest fire is the biggest enemy of forests, and we must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate it. To eliminate forest fires, we cannot stay on slogans, we must come up with effective measures:

First, we must build roads into the main forest areas. Without roads, more than 60 forest management stations on the north slope of the Greater Khingan Mountains have nothing to eat. Without roads, the management stations cannot control mountain fires in the forest area and cannot extinguish them in time. Without roads, the army and the masses often have to walk for eight to ten days to reach the fire site to fight the fire. Therefore, building roads is a key task for forest protection and fire prevention. But to build roads, we must first conduct surveying and design, and we must have technical cadres. It is hoped that the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Forest Industry will vigorously support us.

Second, troops should be stationed on the transportation arteries along the edges of forest areas. Over the years, many troops have been mobilized to fight fires, and the efficiency is very high, but the journey is too long. For example, this year some troops went from Siping and Meihekou to Inner Mongolia to fight fires, spending a lot of time on the road and unable to reach the fire site quickly. If these troops are stationed on the transportation arteries along the edges of forest areas, such as Nenjiang and Hailar, then they can conduct military training when there is no fire, and can be dispatched at any time to fight fires when there is a fire.

Third, helicopters should be purchased for firefighters to descend to the ground to fight fires. On June 4th this year, an ordinary plane that took off from Nenjiang to侦查the fire situation discovered a newly started fire upstream of the Nanweng River. At that time, the people in the plane believed that if a few people could get off the plane, they could put out the fire immediately. However, there was no way to get down. So after the plane returned, everyone studied fire fighting methods and felt that it would take 12 days to mobilize forest workers from Yituli River to the fire site, and it would take 7 days to send troops from near Nenjiang to the fire site. After 7 to 12 days, the burned area would be unknown. No matter how large it may be, it would be impossible to extinguish the fire even with thousands of people. If it had been a helicopter, one or two dozen people could have taken the opportunity to get off the ground and put out the fire when it was small. Therefore, helicopters play an important role in fire fighting, and we should buy several.

Fourth, "walkie-talkies" should be purchased. Without them, the management stations cannot contact each other; without them, it is also difficult for troops to contact each other. In this way, not only can the fire situation not be reported in time, but also food cannot be supplied, and there is a danger of starving to death in the mountains. Therefore, "walkie-talkies" are indispensable.

We will soon propose the above four measures to the State Council, and I will talk about them here first.

3.  Ethnic Minority Issues: Most of our country's forests are distributed in ethnic minority areas. According to the materials that have been learned, there are about 9 million ethnic minorities who live by forestry and near forest areas (excluding Tibet, Qinghai, and Gansu), accounting for about 25% of the total ethnic minority population in the country. Many of these ethnic minorities have rich experience in afforestation, and we must rely on them. In the future, we must earnestly implement ethnic policies in forest areas, take care of the special interests of ethnic minorities, and follow the method of uniting the Oroqen ethnic group in the Greater Khingan Mountains to care for them closely in politics and economics, so that their production and life can be improved, or even further train them to become forestry cadres, so that they can play a greater role in forest protection and afforestation.

4.  Grassroots Organization Issues: The current survival rate of afforestation is very low, mainly because there are no grassroots forestry technical guidance organizations. It is hoped that each province will establish forestry work stations in the next two years, roughly on a district basis.

III.

Forestry workers in the Mao Zedong era have very arduous work, but the task is glorious. The National Greening Conference in December 1955 required us to green 105 million hectares of potentially greenable wasteland and barren mountains within twelve years. If we can overcome all difficulties and complete such a large plan as scheduled, it will not only be unprecedented in Chinese history, but probably also in the history of world forestry. Isn't this glorious?

However, China is one of the countries with the most barren mountains in the world. Greening 105 million hectares in twelve years is only a beginning. After that, there are still 70 million, 100 million, or even 200 million hectares of wasteland and barren mountains waiting for us.

Moreover, the 70 million, 100 million, or 200 million hectares left behind are deep mountains, remote mountains, or rocky mountains that cannot be reached by the strength of the masses, or saline land, alkaline land, or sandy land that are problematic in terms of afforestation technology. The work is more arduous and difficult than in the first twelve years.

Therefore, in these twelve years, our most important tasks are: first, to create advanced experience; second, to train young experts. With experience and young people, we can work continuously for five years and five years, generation after generation. Later forestry workers will be more intelligent, more technically proficient, more experienced, and have stronger strength. When the strength is strong, we will definitely be able to green the wasteland and barren mountains that could not be greened in the first twelve years, be able to transform the forest stands that were not well built in the first twelve years, be able to change the climate, conquer nature, and achieve a national landscape of green mountains and clear waters, favorable weather, and longevity.

    争取做到全国山青水秀风调雨顺
    ——林业部长　梁希
    全国造林计划提前超额完成——森林工业的成绩和缺点——搞好山区生产规划——彻底消灭林火——在林区认真照顾少数民族的特殊利益——以区为单位建立林业工作站——如期完成十二年绿化计划
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告、廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明、彭真副委员长所作全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。
    现在，我想介绍一下林业和森林工业情况，并提出一些关于今后林业的意见，请各位代表批评、指教。一
    从去年下半年以来，在我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设高潮中，林业和森林工业也有了很大的发展和提高。
    首先说林业方面：
    1、造林：由于农业合作化运动的伟大胜利，由于党中央关于绿化祖国的号召，由于各级党政领导对林业的重视，更由于青年团中央在延安召开的有全国各地代表参加的五省（区）青年造林大会的推动，今年春天在全国范围内掀起了轰轰烈烈如火如荼的绿化运动。
    据我五、六月间在浙江和甘肃两省视察，浙江全省受到绿化教育的有1，200多万人，占全省人口的50％以上，参加造林的有430多万人，约占全省人口的20％，其中青少年造林就有200多万人。甘肃全省参加造林的有550万人，占全省人口的41.2％，其中青年造林有200万人。特别值得指出的，是兰州市南北山群众义务造林的故事：大家知道，兰州是干旱的地区，年雨量仅300公厘，种一棵树，周围需要放60斤冰来代替浇水，今年3月1日到15日，有176，000多个劳动力，从黄河到相距5里至25里的山上来回运冰，共灌了170多万棵树。
    总之，绿化与爱国爱乡结合，已成为各地广大群众的行动口号，从乡村到城市，从军队到学校，从机关到企业、厂矿，男女老少都动员起来，出现了数不清楚的突击队，造了数不清楚的青年林、少年林、红领巾林、母亲林、三八林、八一林，甚至还有老年林。
    这样，全国造林，截止6月12日，就达到了419万公顷，完成了1956年任务，为1955年同期造林面积的3.5倍以上。再加上1953—1955这三年造林面积398万公顷，共造了817万多公顷。而第一个五年的造林计划总数为629万公顷，所以我们已提前完成了五年计划，而且超额30％。
    然而，以上说的是量，不是质。说到质，今年不会比往年提高到很多。这表现在造林成活率上，1955年全国平均成活率仅64％。今年虽然普遍地训练了林业员，然而技术指导远远跟不上形势的需要。估计到今秋检查成活率的时候，必不能达到去年全国林业会议上所要求的90％。
      2、护林防火：在山林火灾一向严重的关内各省，由于各级党政和广大群众的努力，今年火灾显然地减少了。甘肃今春山火次数比去年减少92％，毁林面积减少68％；云南1—3 月火灾次数比去年同期减少50％，受灾面积减少67％，林木损失减少72％。其他浙江、陕西、湖南、广西、广东、四川、福建、江西等省也都有不同程度的减轻。
    然而，我们的木库所在地——内蒙古和东北，今年5月忽然发生了大火，25、26、27三天，大小兴安岭发现山火21处，动员了33，700人打火，有些火被打灭，有些火一直烧到6月4日，才被雨浇灭。这次火灾损失的详细数目正在清查，估计草原和森林必烧掉不少。事实告诉我们，我们要防止山火，还必须付出更大的力量来。
    3、森林经营：在全国重点林区，如吉林、黑龙江、内蒙、四川、云南、山西、陕西、甘肃、新疆等省（区），已建立了由省林业厅领导的中间森林管理机构42处，基层森林经营机构（即经营所）352处，配备了工作人员8，335人，管理着国有林1，250多万公顷。这些森林，将会被我们逐步地合理地管理起来。
    但，有的工作人员，由于林中没有道路，没有通讯设备，不能发挥应有的作用；有的技术干部，虽然在高级学校毕业后，又在京受训了4个多月，而分配下去，却被“冷藏”起来，没有适当地安排工作。
    其次说森林工业方面：
    1、采运工业：在东北和内蒙的国有林，已形成大型企业，并使用着现代化的技术装备。1955年推行了班组经济核算制，召开了先进经验交流会议，展开了社会主义劳动竞赛，出现了空前未有的新气象。原木生产成本比1954年降低7.25％，生产工人每人年平均产量113.67立方公尺，劳动生产率比1952年提高了2.04倍。说到生产机械化的比重，在1955年末，集材达到5.28％，运材至中间贮木场达到20.84％，运材至最终贮木场达到85.08％。
    2、制材工业与林产化学工业：由于生产技术操作及设备都有改进，制材厂与林产化学工厂的设备利用率提高了。今年第一季度制材超额完成产量计划的101． 38％，林化超额完成产值计划的102.91％。
    3、木材市场销售：在今年第一季度完成市场销售1，925，724立方公尺，比去年同期增长49.4％。
    以上虽获得一些成绩，但缺点还是很多，最突出的有：
    1、在采运工业上，落后的季节性的生产方式还占着相当比重；机械化生产工艺过程，还缺少全面规划，因此每个生产工序的机械设备不平衡，闲置了不少机械；劳动组织还不合理，劳动生产率每日每工木材综合产量仅0.34立方公尺，比到苏联1954年的0.9立方公尺，相差将近三倍；劳动保护又不够好，伤亡事故仍很严重。
      2、制材工业与林产化学工业的发展，没有很好地配合采运工业，大大落后于国民经济的需要，木材及其他林产利用率甚低，每年弃置于采伐迹地和木材加工厂的木材，几乎与采伐生产的原木产量相等，或竟超过，损失很大。
      3、在木材销售上，对农村，不论在数量上和在规格上，均不能满足农民的要求。二
    关于今后林业的一些意见。现在，森林工业已分出去单独成部，这方面我就不提意见了，我只提出林业方面几个问题：
    1、开山问题：廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）说明中说，许多地方的许多农业生产合作社只强调农业生产，而忽视在农民收入中占很大比重的林业。是的，我在浙江视察中，也得到了这种实例。许多合作社往往不顾一切地追求粮食增产，只有在党照顾得到的地方，山林还幸免遭殃，例如开化县富户乡已经组织了170个劳动力，计划上山开垦两月，被县委发觉、制止。而在县委照顾不到的地方，有的开山种粮，如象山县南韭山30度以上山坡被垦12，000多亩，种了番薯；有的毁林种粮，如汤溪县城关区油茶1，500亩，被龙游一个劳改农场全部砍光，种了玉米。
    大家知道，开山是要惹起水土流失的。据甘肃天水县水土保持站试验，每公顷土地的泥土冲刷量，在26度45分倾斜的麦田，冲刷381.8公斤，而在29度33分倾斜的洋槐林地（没有地被物），只冲刷76.8公斤，即100比20。
    水土流失，就容易发生山洪。中国每省都有一条或几条不驯服的河，不驯服的河，都起因于不长树木的山。俗语说得好：
  “山上开荒，山下遭殃”。
    如何防止开山，防止流失水土？我们以为，只有搞好了山区生产规划，特别是作好合理利用土地的规划，解决农、林、牧之间的矛盾，才可以给群众指出美丽的远景，才可以防止群众滥垦山地。
    现在，林业部根据国务院指示，已会同有关部门在国务院第七办公室领导下，组成了山区生产规划办公室。希望各地人民委员会也加强对山区生产规划的领导，把山区宜农、宜林、宜牧的土地加以合理划分，大力保持水土，保障农业生产。
    2、林火问题：林火是森林最大的敌人，我们必须坚决地彻底地把它消灭，而要消灭林火，我们不能停留在口号上，必须拿出有效的措施来：
    第一，要向主要林区内部，修筑公路。没有路，大兴安岭北坡60多个森林经营所没有饭吃。没有路，经营所不能控制林区
  山火，不能及时扑灭它。没有路，军队和群众往往要步行八天十天，才能赶到火场打火。所以，修筑公路，是护林防火的关键性工作。但要修公路，必须先行勘测设计，必须有技术干部。希望交通部、铁道部和森林工业部大力支援我们。
    第二，要在林区边沿的交通要道上派驻军队。历年动员很多部队打火，效率是很高的，但是路程太远，例如今年有的军队从四平、梅河口到内蒙去打火，在路上消费了很多时间，不能迅速到达火场。如果这些军队驻防在林区边沿的交通要道，如嫩江、海拉尔等地，那末，无火，可以进行军事训练，有火，随时可以出动打火。
      第三，要购买直升飞机，作为救火人员下地扑火之用。今年6月4日，从嫩江出发侦查火情的普通飞机，在南瓮河上游，发现了一股刚起的火，当时飞机中的人认为如果能够有几个人从飞机上下去，马上就可以扑灭这股火。可是，没法下去。于是在飞机回来后，大家研究扑火方法，觉得要从伊图里河动员森工人员到火场去，需走12天，要从嫩江附近派军队到火场去，需走7天，经过7天至12天，火烧面积，不知要大到什么程度，到那时，即使用几千人也把火扑灭不了。如果当时坐的是直升飞机，则一、二十人就可以趁火小的时候下地扑灭它。所以直升飞机对扑火有重要作用，我们应该买上几架。
    第四，要购买“报话机”。没有它，经营所与经营所之间不能联系；没有它，部队与部队之间也不好联系。这样，不但是火情不能及时通报，而且粮食也得不到供应，有饿死在山里的危险。因此，“报话机”是不可缺少的。
    以上四项措施，我们即将向国务院建议，我先在这里说一说。
    3、少数民族问题：我国森林多分布在少数民族地区。据已了解的材料，靠林业为生与在林区附近的少数民族约有900多万人（不包括西藏、青海、甘肃），占全国少数民族人口总数的25％左右。其中有许多少数民族，在营林方面有丰富的经验，我们必须依靠他们。今后，在林区必须认真贯彻民族政策，照顾少数民族的特殊利益，仿照在大兴安岭林区团结鄂伦春民族的办法，在政治上、经济上密切关怀他们，使他们生产和生活得到改善，或竟进一步培养他们成为林业干部，使他们在护林、造林上起更大的作用。
    4、基层机构问题：现在造林成活率甚低，主要原因是由于没有基层的林业技术指导机构。希望各省在今明两年内，大体上以区为单位，把林业工作站都建立起来。三
    毛泽东时代的林业工作者，工作是很艰巨的，但任务是光荣的。1955年12月全国绿化会议要求我们：十二年内绿化可能绿化的荒地荒山10，500万公顷。这样大的计划，我们如果能够克服一切困难，如期完成，不单是中国历史上所无，即世界林业史上恐怕也没有前例。这不是光荣么？
    然而，中国是世界上荒山最多的一个国家，十二年绿化10，500万公顷，只是一个开端，此后还有7，000万、1亿、甚至2亿公顷的荒地荒山等着我们。
    而且，留下来的7，000万、1亿或2亿公顷，是群众力量所不到的深山、远山、或者是石山，是造林技术上成问题的盐地、碱地、或者是砂地。工作比头十二年更繁重更艰难。
    因此，在这十二年内，我们最重要的任务是：第一，创造先进经验，第二，培养青年专家。有了经验，有了青年，就可以五年又五年，一代又一代，连续不绝地工作下去。后来的林业工作者，头脑更聪敏，技术更高明，经验更丰富，力量更雄厚。等到力量雄厚，我们一定能够绿化头十二年不能绿化的荒地荒山，能够改造头十二年没有造好的林相，能够改变气候，征服自然，做到全中国山青水秀；风调雨顺；人寿年丰。
