Bumper Harvest in Rural Sichuan
By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen

\tRural Sichuan in May is a sea of gold. The ripe wheat and rapeseed undulate in waves, seeming to rush into people's hands. Men and women farmers, busy harvesting, swing their sickles, piling the cut wheat into neat, long rows. Songs, laughter, and the rustling of sickles fill the fragrant fields from morning till night.

\tThis is the first bumper harvest after agricultural cooperativization. The total output of wheat reached 3,173.3 million jin, exceeding the planned output for 1957, the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, by 22.7%, and an increase of more than 400 million jin compared to last year. Although the total area planted with rapeseed was slightly reduced, the yield per unit area increased by 7.1%, bringing the total rapeseed production to 613.76 million jin, an increase of nearly 29.22 million jin compared to last year. In the Wenjiang Special District, the average yield of wheat per mu reached 227 jin, and rapeseed reached 137 jin. In Wanxian, Yibin, Nanchong and other special districts, the output of spring crops generally increased by 20% to 30%, with broad beans and peas increasing by 30% to 40%, the highest yields in recent years. Cooperativization has also enabled some barren mountain slopes to achieve high yields. In Yibin County, located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Zhao Shuheng, the director of the Huangjueping Agricultural Cooperative, led us to visit the Red Stone Mountain, which has only a few inches of soil. On this iron-hard red sandy rock layer, thanks to land improvement, the use of improved varieties, and timely application of topdressing fertilizer, the yield of wheat per mu increased from more than 200 jin last year to 350 jin, with the cooperative harvesting 120,000 jin more wheat than last year.

\tDuring the summer harvest, all regions generally strengthened the leadership of the summer harvest distribution work. Harvesting and distributing simultaneously, leaving less and distributing more, and ensuring that more than 90% of cooperative members increase their income are the characteristics of this year's summer harvest distribution. In Neijiang County, among the more than 1,800 agricultural cooperatives that completed the summer harvest distribution, 90% of the cooperative members increased their income compared to last year. In the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative of Hexing Township, Pixian County, the output of spring crops increased by 53% this year, and the income per labor day increased from 3 jiao last year to more than 6 jiao, with 90% of the cooperative members increasing their income. The members of the tenth production team, which was a small cooperative last year, earned only a little more than 1 jiao per labor day in the summer harvest, with each household earning only 20 yuan. This year, the average income per household in the team was more than 100 yuan in the summer harvest.

\tIn Sichuan in May, the high tide of agricultural production continues to develop. In this most tense and busiest season of the year, spring crops are being harvested on one side of the mountain, while rice seedlings are being transplanted on the other. In order to strive to overfulfill the province's plan to increase grain production by 4.5 billion jin, the land utilization rate has generally been improved. Last year, the province had only 80,000 mu of double-cropping rice, but this year the area planted with double-cropping rice has expanded ninety times compared to last year, with 7.26 million mu of early rice seedlings already transplanted. In the Luzhou area, where the season is earlier, some agricultural cooperatives are also experimenting with harvesting three crops of rice a year. Increasing the planting of double-cropping rice alone can increase the harvest of rice by at least 1.44 billion jin compared to last year.

\tAlthough multiple cropping, intercropping, and seedling transplanting have increased fertilizer consumption, farmers have widely developed fertilizer sources under the slogan of "1,000 jin of grain, 10,000 jin of fertilizer," increasing the amount of fertilizer applied in spring plowing by three to four times compared to previous years. In addition to collecting dust from roads, silt from ditches, and decayed soil from weeds on mountains, they have also established small fertilizer manufacturing plants and dug out peat fertilizer buried underground. This peat, which is rich in nitrogen, has been discovered in more than 30 counties on the edge of the basin, such as Pengxian, Guanxian, and Dayi. This year, Wenjiang, Dayi and other counties alone dug up 1.6 billion jin to put into the fields. At the same time, farmers also plowed large amounts of broad beans and vetches into the soil to increase the nitrogen and organic matter in the soil, so that the land can maintain a high degree of fertility.

\tThe largest-scale farmland water conservancy project in history is being carried out throughout the province. Although Sichuan has 81 rivers in addition to the four major tributaries of the Yangtze River, more than half of the province's 110 million mu of arable land is still dry land. In order to ensure that rice seedlings are fully planted and transplanted, and to turn dry land and sloping land into irrigated land, thousands upon thousands of mountain ponds, reservoirs, dams, and weirs are being built in the high mountains and on the slopes. In addition, people have also blocked up thousands upon thousands of mountain springs that are lost every year, and used spring water to irrigate fields. In Jiangjin Special District alone, more than 10,000 agricultural cooperatives have diverted natural water sources to irrigate more than 260,000 mu of rice paddies. It is estimated that by September, more than 6.2 million mu of dry land in the province will be turned into irrigated land.

\tIn order to fundamentally improve agricultural production conditions, the CPC Suining Prefectural Committee and Nanchong Prefectural Committee alone mobilized 2.44 million farmers before and after, with the great spirit of overturning mountains and seas, to carry out a struggle to improve soil, conserve water and soil, and change the terrain on more than 3.43 million mu of land. Thousands of hillsides have been turned into terraces and terraced fields. Terraced rice paddies are stacked layer upon layer from the foot of the mountain to the top. Looking down from a high place, the verdant countryside seems to be wrapped in countless crystal brocade belts.

\tIncreasing the economic income of cooperative members from various aspects and actively striving to transition from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives are the most concerned issues for the province's more than 190,000 agricultural cooperatives. At present, farm households in advanced cooperatives account for only 3.43% of the total farm households in Sichuan. In order to facilitate the transition, many primary cooperatives have established general cooperatives or transition committees, and are taking practical actions to improve production and increase income to prepare for the merger and transition of cooperatives after autumn. After reversing the tendency to only focus on agriculture and neglect sideline occupations, diversified operations have generally developed in various places. Some cooperatives even operate more than 20 kinds of sideline occupations. As an important source of income for Sichuan farmers, the pig raising industry has increased by more than 400,000 sows in the past three months alone after implementing the "self-breeding and self-raising" policy. The Jiang'an Daqiao Agricultural Cooperative on the banks of the Yangtze River operates 19 kinds of sideline occupations such as fishing, fish farming, beekeeping, flour mills, and paper mills, and the total income can reach more than 200,000 yuan, and the sideline occupation income of each cooperative member household can reach 400 yuan.

\tA surge in production has also appeared in the grasslands of western Sichuan, the Kangzang Plateau, and the depths of the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains. More than 2.1 million Tibetan and Yi compatriots, under the joint consultation of public leaders of all ethnic groups and the broad masses of working people, have completed social democratic reforms in areas with a population of more than 900,000 after four or five months. The working people who have been allocated land and other means of production have organized mutual aid groups or agricultural cooperatives. More than 20,000 Bai Yi people in Zhaojue, Meigu and other counties in Liangshan have organized mutual aid groups and 133 agricultural cooperatives. In order to help the Yi people develop production, the government has loaned out more than 30,000 pieces of agricultural implements free of charge, initially changing the habit of slash-and-burn cultivation and not applying manure to crops. Bi Munjue, the Yi director of the Zhaojue Chengxi District Agricultural Cooperative, excitedly told people at the Sichuan Rural Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference held in May:

\t"After the democratic reforms, Chairman Mao's sun shines on us, and now the night is as bright as the day. We must learn from the Han farmers' experience in growing crops, do a good job in production, and have a good harvest in autumn."

    丰收的四川农村
    本报记者　纪希晨
    五月的四川农村，到处一片金黄。成熟了的麦子、油菜，滚着波浪，向人们手边扑来。忙着收割的男女农民，挥动着镰刀，把一行行割下的麦子，堆成平整的长排。歌声、笑声和镰刀的沙沙声，从早到晚响遍那芬芳的田野。
    这是农业合作化后的第一次丰收。全省二千五百多万亩小麦、油菜普遍增产。小麦总产量达三十一亿七千三百多万斤，超过1957年即第一个五年计划的最末一年的计划产量的22.7％，比去年多收了四亿多斤。油菜总面积虽有些缩小，可是单位产量却提高了7.1％，使油菜总产量达六亿一千三百七十六万斤，比去年增产近二千九百二十二万斤。温江专区平均每亩小麦达227斤，油菜达137斤。万县、宜宾、南充等专区，小春作物普遍增产二成到三成，其中葫豆、豌豆增产三、四成，是几年来产量最高的一年。合作化使一些贫瘠的山坡地也获得了高额的丰产。在长江上游的宜宾县，黄桷坪农业合作社社长赵树恒，引我们参观了那仅有几寸泥土的红石山。在这铁板红砂的岩层上，由于进行了土地加工，采用良种，及时增施追肥，每亩小麦由去年的二百多斤增加到三百五十斤，全社比去年多收了十二万斤小麦。
    在夏收中，各地普遍加强了夏收分配工作的领导。一边收割一边分配、少留多分、保证90％以上社员增加收入，是今年夏收分配的特点。内江县夏收分配结束的一千八百多个农业合作社，90％的社员都比去年增加了收入。郫县合兴乡红光农业合作社，今年小春作物增产53％，每个劳动日的收益从去年的三角钱增加到六角多，90％的社员都增加了收入。第十生产队的社员，去年是个小社，每个劳动日的夏季报酬只一角多钱，每户收入二十来元，今年夏收全队每户平均收入一百多元。
    五月的四川，农业生产高潮还在继续发展。在这一年中最紧张、最繁忙的季节里，往往山这边还在抢收小春，山那边就又开始插秧。为争取超额完成全省粮食增产四十五亿斤的计划，土地利用率普遍提高了。去年全省双季稻仅有八万亩，今年种植双季稻的面积比去年扩大了九十倍，已经有七百二十六万亩完成了早稻的插秧。季节较早的泸州地区，有些农业合作社还进行了一年收获三季水稻的试验。全省仅增种双季水稻一项，至少就可比去年增加十四亿四千斤稻谷的收获。
    复种、间作和育苗移栽虽然扩大了肥料的消耗，但是农民却在“千斤粮万斤肥”的口号下，广泛开辟了肥源，使今年春耕施肥量比往年提高了三、四倍。他们除收集了大路上的尘土，沟里的淤泥和山上的杂草腐土以外，还开办了小型肥料制造厂，挖出了埋藏在地下的泥炭肥。这种含有丰富氮素的泥炭，在盆地边缘上的彭县、灌县、大邑等三十多县都有发现，今年仅温江、大邑等县就挖了十六亿斤上到田里。同时，农民还把大量葫豆、苕子翻耕在地里，增加土壤的氮和有机质，使土地得以保持高度的肥力。
    历史上规模最大的农田水利工程，正在全省开展。四川除长江四大支流以外，虽然还有八十一条河流，可是全省一亿一千多万亩耕地，仍有一大半是旱地。为了保证水稻满栽满插，并且把旱地、坡地变成水浇地，成千成万的山塘、水库、坝、堰，在高山上和坡岭间兴修起来了。此外，人们还把常年流失的成千上万股山泉封堵起来，利用泉水灌田。仅江津专区一万多个农业合作社，就引自然水源灌溉了二十六万多亩稻田。预计到九月，全省将有六百二十万多亩旱地变成水浇
  田。
      为着从根本上改善农业生产条件，仅中共遂宁地委和南充地委，前后就动员二百四十四万农民，以排山倒海的伟大气魄，在三百四十三万多亩土地上，进行改良土壤，保持水土，改变地形的斗争。千万块山坡变成了梯土和梯田。梯形水田，层层叠叠地一直从山脚盘升到山巅。从高处向下看，青翠的山野，仿佛缠绕了无数水晶的锦带。
    从多方面增加社员经济收入，积极争取从初级社过渡到高级社，是全省十九万多个农业合作社最关心的事情。目前，高级社入社农户只占四川总农户的3.43％。为了便于过渡，许多初级社都成立了总社或转社委员会，正以搞好生产，增加收入的实际行动，给秋后的并社转社做好准备。各地在扭转只重视农业，忽视副业的偏向以后，多种经营普遍有了发展。有的社甚至经营二十多种副业。作为四川农民收入重要源泉的养猪业，在贯彻执行了“自繁自养”的方针以后，最近三个多月，单母猪就增加了四十多万只。长江岸边的江安大桥农业合作社经营的打鱼、育鱼、养蜂、粉房、纸厂等十九种副业，全部收入可达到二十多万元，每户社员的副业收入可达四百元。
    生产热潮也出现在川西的草地、康藏高原和大小凉山的深处。二百一十多万藏族和彝族同胞，在各族公众领袖和广大劳动人民的共同协商下，经过四、五个月的时间，已经有九十多万人口的地区完成社会民主改革。分得了土地和其他生产资料的劳动人民，组织了互助组或农业合作社。凉山的昭觉、美姑等县的二万多白彝人民，组织了互助组和一百三十三个农业合作社。政府为了帮助彝族人民发展生产，贷出无偿农具三万多件，初步改变了刀耕火种、种庄稼不上粪的习惯。昭觉城西区农业合作社彝族社长比母尼觉在五月间举行的四川农村青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上兴奋地对人说：
      “经过民主改革，毛主席的太阳照到了我们身上，现在黑夜也和白天一样明亮。我们要学习汉族农民种庄稼的经验，把生产搞好，让秋天有好收成”。
