Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 15th: The Polish News Agency is authorized to publish the following statement by the Government of the Polish People's Republic: The US military command in South Korea recently took an arbitrary decision regarding the "temporary" cessation of activities of the inspection teams in South Korea. Regarding this unilateral and illegal action, it is necessary to point out that the inspection teams are an agency of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, with whose assistance the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission fulfilled its responsibilities, and that the inspection teams were established in accordance with the Armistice Agreement. It is clear that this measure, taken to prevent the activities of the inspection teams, is equivalent to an action against the entire Commission. Therefore, the above-mentioned decision of the US military command is a serious violation of the Armistice Agreement.

In order to seek justification for its actions, the US military command is—this is not the first time—making unfounded and slanderous accusations against the Polish and Czechoslovak representatives within the Commission. While absolutely denying these untrue accusations, it is necessary to point out that when the Polish People's Republic accepted to participate in the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, it hoped to contribute to the cause of consolidating peace in Korea and resolving the political issues of Korea, and to the cause of general international reconciliation.

The Polish delegation participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea has consistently and systematically made and is still making efforts to ensure the implementation of the Armistice Agreement. It is necessary to add that due to the failure of the US military command in South Korea to fulfill its responsibility to ensure the safety of the personnel of the inspection teams, representatives of the Polish delegation lost their lives at their posts in South Korea.

The Government of the Polish People's Republic believes that a possible reorganization of the inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea could have been achieved on the basis of understanding between all parties, while not violating the Armistice Agreement, as the previous example in August 1955 had proven, when the activities of the inspection teams in several Korean ports were temporarily suspended. The purpose of the June 5th proposal of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was to achieve a similar solution to this problem in other ports within the scope of the inspection.

However, due to the opposition of the United States, this proposal was rejected. The responsibility for taking this step lies entirely with the United States and other countries participating in the United Nations Command.

The Polish Government believes that, in accordance with the explicit provisions of the Armistice Agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea fully retains the right to dispatch inspection teams to inspection locations.

    波兰通讯社受权发表声明
    抗议美方非法停止视察小组的活动
    新华社华沙15日电　波兰通讯社受权发表波兰人民共和国政府的声明如下：在南朝鲜的美军司令部最近采取了关于“暂时”停止视察小组在南朝鲜的活动的专横决定。对于这一片面而非法的行动，有必要指出，视察小组是在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会的机构，在它的帮助下，中立国监察委员会履行了它的职责，而且视察小组是根据停战协定成立的。很显然，为了阻止视察小组活动而采取的这一措施等于是对整个委员会采取的行动。因此，美军司令部的上述决定是对停战协定的严重破坏。
    美军司令部为了替它的行动寻求辩护，正在——这并不是第一次——对委员会内的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表们进行毫无根据的和诬蔑性的指责。在绝对地否认这些不真实的指责的同时，有必要指出，波兰人民共和国在接受参加在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会工作的时候，希望对巩固朝鲜和平和解决朝鲜的政治问题的事业、对一般的国际和解的事业作出它的贡献。
    参加中立国监察委员会的波兰代表团一直经常不断地和有步骤地作出并且现在也还在作出努力，以便保证履行停战协定。有必要补充说，由于在南朝鲜的美军司令部没有能够履行它确保视察小组人员的安全的责任，波兰代表团的代表在南朝鲜的工作岗位上丧失了生命。
    波兰人民共和国政府认为，朝鲜中立国监察委员会视察小组的可能的改组，本来可以在各方之间的谅解的基础上，同时在不破坏停战协定的情况下实现，如1955年8月的前例所曾经证明的那样，那时曾经暂时停止了视察小组在若干朝鲜口岸的活动。朝鲜中立国监察委员会六月五日的建议的目的是要对视察所及的其他口岸达到这个问题的类似的解决。
    但是，由于美国方面的反对，这个建议遭到了拒绝。采取这个步骤的责任完全在于美国以及参加联合国军司令部的其他国家。
    波兰政府认为，按照停战协定的明文规定，朝鲜中立国监察委员会充分保留着派遣视察小组到视察地点去的权利。
