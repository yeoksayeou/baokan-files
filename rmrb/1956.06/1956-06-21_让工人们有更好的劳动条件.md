    Let Workers Have Better Working Conditions
    The State Council has promulgated the "Factory Safety and Hygiene Regulations," "Construction and Installation Engineering Safety Technical Regulations," "Worker and Staff Injury and Death Accident Reporting Regulations," and a resolution on conscientiously implementing the above three regulations. It also approved the decision on preventing silicosis hazards in factories and mining enterprises. The promulgation of these labor protection regulations once again embodies the infinite care of the Communist Party and the People's Government for the health and safety of workers and staff. Implementing these labor protection regulations is of great significance for further improving working conditions and strengthening labor protection work.
    Improving working conditions is an important measure to strengthen labor protection and increase labor productivity. Working conditions are the material guarantee for labor protection. With ideological education on safe production and safety technical regulations restricting risky operations, it is still impossible to eliminate casualties without working conditions that adequately ensure safety. In recent years, the Party and the government have made great efforts to improve the working conditions of workers. Therefore, the working conditions of our country's workers have greatly improved compared to before liberation. In the past, the vast majority of coal mines relied on natural ventilation, and the working conditions underground were extremely harsh, with the mines resembling hell. Now, 98% of state-owned coal mines have adopted mechanical ventilation, and the working conditions in many large and newly built mines are excellent, with workers praising them as "underground cities." In the past, in the high-temperature workshops of iron and steel enterprises and textile enterprises, heatstroke and fainting would occur daily in summer, with workers calling them "steamers." Now, cooling and heat insulation equipment has been universally installed, the temperature is normal, and some workers say, "Our workshops are always like spring."
    This change profoundly shows how great the difference is between the socialist system and the capitalist system and any pre-capitalist social system. In all past dynasties, which government, which political party, has ever shown such meticulous care for workers as the People's Government and the Communist Party? In 1955 alone, the expenditure on safety technical measures by the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and the Ministry of Railways amounted to more than 30 million yuan. Has there ever been such a good thing in history!
    However, it would be wrong to be satisfied simply because we have done a lot of work in improving working conditions. In fact, the working conditions in our factories, mines, and construction sites are not all very good. We have many new enterprises with first-class technical equipment and first-class working conditions; but at present, there are still more existing enterprises in our country. Although their working conditions have been greatly improved, they are still not good enough, and some are even very bad. For example, some enterprises lack airtight equipment, which is not enough to prevent the emission of toxic gases; some enterprises lack dust removal equipment, which is not enough to eliminate the flying of dust; some enterprises lack ventilation equipment, which is not enough to regulate and purify the air in the workplace. As for poor insulation of electrical equipment, and the lack of corresponding safety devices for special machinery such as boilers and cranes, these are still common phenomena. On construction sites, although there is a large amount of safety protection equipment, basic construction is continuous, and various processes affect each other. Accidents still occur due to unreasonable layout of the construction site and improper arrangement of construction procedures. Moreover, the chaos in factories, mines, and construction sites, and the dirty environment, are even more common phenomena.
    Some comrades do not take these unsatisfactory phenomena to heart. They do not understand the important significance of improving working conditions for ensuring safety and improving labor productivity. Therefore, the following happens: on the one hand, accidents occur due to the lack of labor protection equipment and protective equipment, and poor working conditions; on the other hand, a large amount of labor protection funds and safety technical measures funds are accumulated. For example, the Second Engineering Section of the First Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways received more than 60,000 yuan in labor protection funds last year, but accumulated more than 30,000 yuan; and the most basic protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and goggles needed by workers have not been well resolved. Many tunnelers suffer from trachoma, and many chisel operators wear out the skin on their palms. This year, the labor protection funds for this engineering section have increased to more than 120,000 yuan, but the budget for protective equipment in the first half of this year is only more than 30,000 yuan, which is bound to cause accumulation again. Is it that the working conditions there are already very good, and there is nothing that needs to be resolved? It is understood that the above-mentioned protective equipment problems have not been properly resolved.
    It would also be wrong to think that improving working conditions is to spend all the labor protection funds and safety technical measures funds, and buy some safety equipment and add some protective equipment indiscriminately. Improving working conditions is a very meticulous and scientific task. There are certain rules about what kind of situation is prone to what kind of accident, and what kind of protective measures should be taken. Insufficient investigation of the situation, even a slight oversight, will leave a gap for accidents. Taking measures that are not sufficient to ensure safety is also in vain; taking measures that exceed the needs of safety is even more wasteful. To improve working conditions both economically and effectively, it is necessary to conduct thorough investigation and research and take appropriate measures.
    The above-mentioned regulations and decisions promulgated by the State Council are formulated by concentrating the experience of our country's labor protection work in recent years. It is hoped that the competent authorities of enterprises and enterprise units will organize administrative management personnel and engineering technical personnel at all levels to study and research these laws and regulations, check the existing problems in the current labor protection work in accordance with the spirit of these laws and regulations, and formulate specific solutions. Party organizations, trade union organizations, and labor departments at all levels can use these laws and regulations to urge the administrative leaders of enterprises to improve working conditions and strengthen labor protection work, and widely carry out propaganda and education to workers and staff, so that the masses are familiar with these laws and regulations, master these laws and regulations, care about and supervise the implementation of these laws and regulations, and fight against all phenomena that disregard and violate the state's labor protection laws and regulations and all phenomena that neglect labor protection work.
    Improving working conditions is an indispensable measure to ensure safe production, but it is not the only measure. What makes casualties have opportunities to take advantage of and gaps to drill are not only the deficiencies in working conditions, but often the deficiencies in ideology and systems. The principle of safe production has not been given enough attention in some enterprises. When arranging and checking production work, these enterprises often neglect to arrange and check safety work, and also lack a responsibility system for safe production. Therefore, in order to effectively ensure safe production, while paying attention to improving working conditions, we must also pay attention to strengthening ideological education on safe production and strictly implementing the responsibility system for safe production.

### 让工人们有更好的劳动条件

    让工人们有更好的劳动条件
    国务院公布了“工厂安全卫生规程”、“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”、“工人职员伤亡事故报告规程”和关于切实执行上述三项规程的决议，并通过了关于防止厂、矿企业中矽尘危害的决定。这些劳动保护法规的公布，又一次体现了共产党和人民政府对职工群众的健康和安全的无限关怀，贯彻执行这些劳动保护法规，对于进一步改善劳动条件，加强劳动保护工作，是有重大意义的。
    改善劳动条件，是加强劳动保护工作，提高劳动生产率的重要措施。劳动条件是劳动保护的物质保证。有了安全生产的思想教育工作，有了约束冒险作业的安全技术规程，如果没有足以保障安全的劳动条件，依然是无法杜绝伤亡事故的。几年来，党和政府为改善工人的劳动条件作了很大的努力，因此我国工人的劳动条件，比之解放以前已有了很大的改善。从前，绝大多数煤矿依靠自然通风，井下的劳动条件十分恶劣，矿井犹如地狱。现在，98％的国营煤矿采用了机械通风，许多大的和新建的矿井劳动条件优良，工人们夸它为“地下的城市”。从前，钢铁企业、纺织企业的高温车间，一到夏天，中暑昏倒的事情日必数起，工人们说它是“蒸笼”。现在，普遍装配了降温、隔热设备，温度正常，有些工人说：“我们的车间永远是春天”。
    这种变化极其深刻地表明：社会主义制度同资本主义制度及资本主义前的任何一种社会制度，有多么大的区别。历朝历代，有那一个政府，那一个政党，曾经像人民政府、像共产党这样表现出对劳动者无微不至的关怀？1955年，仅重工业部、第一机械工业部、纺织工业部和铁道部开支的安全技术措施经费就有三千多万元。历史上那曾有过这样好的事！
    然而，如果因为我们在改善劳动条件方面做了许多工作就满足了，那是不对的。事实上，我们的工厂、矿山和建筑工地的劳动条件，并不是都已经很好了。我们有许多新建企业，技术装备是头等的，劳动条件也是头等的；但目前，在我们国家里，更多的毕竟还是原有企业。它们的劳动条件尽管有许多改善，也还是不够好的，有的甚至还很坏。例如：有些企业缺乏密闭设备，不足以杜绝有毒气体的散发；有些企业缺乏排尘设备，不足以消除粉尘的飞扬；有些企业缺乏通风设备，不足以调节和净化工作场所的空气；至于电气设备绝缘不良，锅炉、吊车等特种机械缺乏相应的安全装置等等，都还是常见的现象。在建筑工地上，虽然有了大量的安全防护设备，但基本建设是连续施工的，各个工序相互影响，由于施工现场布置不合理，施工程序安排得不妥当，因而发生事故的情形还是有的。至于工厂、矿山和建筑工地秩序混乱，环境肮脏，更是普遍现象。
    对于这些不能令人满意的现象，有些同志并没有放在心上。他们不了解改善劳动条件对于保障安全，提高劳动生产率的重要意义。因而发生这样的事情：一方面由于缺乏劳动保护设备和防护用品，劳动条件不好而发生事故；另一方面大量的劳动保护经费和安全技术措施经费却积压下来。例如铁道部新建铁路工程总局第一工程局第二工程段去年领了六万多元劳动保护经费，却积压了三万多元；而工人所需要的口罩、手套、风镜等最起码的防护用品都没有很好的解决，很多掘隧道的工人害砂眼，很多冲钎的工人磨破手心皮。今年这个工程段的劳动保护经费增加到十二万多元，但今年上半年的防护用品预算只三万多元，势必又造成积压。是不是他们那里的劳动条件已经很好，已经没有什么问题需要解决了呢？据了解，上述那些防护用品问题并没有适当解决。
    如果以为改善劳动条件，就是把劳动保护经费和安全技术措施经费花个一干二净，胡乱买些安全设备，添些防护用品，那也是错误的。改善劳动条件是一件非常细致的、科学的工作。什么样的情况容易出什么样的事故，应该采取什么样的防护措施，都有一定的规律。对情况调查不周，偶有疏忽，就会给事故留下了空子。采取的措施不足以保障安全，也是枉然；采取的措施超过了安全的需要更是浪费。要想既经济而又确有实效地改善劳动条件，就需要进行周密的调查研究，采取妥当的措施。
    国务院公布的上述这些规程和决定，是集中了几年来我国劳动保护工作的经验而制定的。希望各企业主管部门和企业单位组织各级行政管理人员、工程技术人员学习和研究这些法规，根据这些法规的精神，检查目前劳动保护工作中存在的问题，订出具体的解决办法。各级党组织、工会组织、劳动部门，可以根据这些法规来督促企业的行政领导改善劳动条件，加强劳动保护工作，并且广泛地向职工群众进行宣传教育，让群众熟悉这些法规，掌握这些法规，关心和监督这些法规的实施，向一切漠视和违反国家的劳动保护法规和一切忽视劳动保护工作的现象作斗争。
    改善劳动条件，是保证安全生产必不可少的措施，但并不是唯一的措施。使得伤亡事故有机可乘，有隙可钻的，并不只是劳动条件方面的缺陷，而且常常是思想上、制度上的缺陷。安全生产的方针在某些企业里是没有受到足够重视的。这些企业在布置和检查生产工作的时候，常常忽视布置和检查安全工作，也缺乏安全生产的责任制度。因此，为了切实保证安全生产，在注意改善劳动条件的同时，还要注意加强安全生产的思想教育，严密安全生产的责任制度。
