    Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report reflects the achievements of the national plan in its execution during 1955, puts forward the 1956 budget in accordance with the requirements of completing and overfulfilling the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and points out the direction of efforts to realize this budget. After listening to this report, I felt very satisfied and expressed my agreement.
    Vice Premier Li said that "local finance is an important component of the entire national finance." The local budgets in this national budget were proposed by the people's committees of various places and can certainly meet the requirements of various places. However, in order to strengthen the initiative and enthusiasm of local financial work, I believe that in the future, when local budgets are being compiled, the local people's committees at all levels can first draft the budget in accordance with the specific circumstances of the local annual plan and submit it to the local people's congress for discussion, so as to obtain broader public opinion, better play the role of the local people's congress, and then report it to the central government, which will review the increases and decreases, make overall planning and balance, and include it in the national budget. In this way, it can "combine the principle of unified leadership and unified planning of the central government with the principle of graded responsibility and adapting to local conditions of the localities," and better play the positive role of all parties in striving to realize the national budget.
    The report mentioned that in order to adapt to the needs of economic development, a large number of skilled workers will be trained. The plan of the seventeen ministries this year will reach 710,000 people, which is very exciting. For example, in the past few years, Shanghai has transported a large number of technical personnel and skilled workers to support construction in various places, and has also trained a certain number of technicians. Of course, it will continue to play its role in the future, but in order to advance towards science, most of the urban youth have already gone to school, and the source of talent training feels lacking. In the past, in order to prevent affecting agricultural production, the government issued instructions to dissuade farmers from blindly flowing into cities, which was completely necessary. Under the new situation, in order to meet the needs of training technicians, can rural youth be recruited in a planned way and cultivated, so that the city can not only transport cadres to support national construction, but also supplement new forces to meet the needs of production. At the same time, in the past few years, many technical personnel in Shanghai have been transferred, but too few have been replenished, and very few college graduates have been assigned to Shanghai (especially in electrical engineering and machinery), which has a certain impact on the role of the original industrial base. It is hoped that the competent authorities can pay attention to this and allocate them reasonably.
    In order to implement the policy of peaceful transformation, the government earnestly did a good job in the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and cared for the lives of industrialists and businessmen. Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech put forward various specific measures. Such care can be said to be meticulous. As one of the industrialists and businessmen, I express my heartfelt support and put forward some specific opinions in this regard for reference. (1) Most of the houses of small business owners in Shanghai are rented. In the past, the small business owners did not distinguish between home and shop, and the rent was paid by the enterprise. If it is divided now, it is proposed to take care of it so that the rent is still paid by the enterprise, so as to avoid increasing the burden and affecting life. (2) Increasing the source of goods and the turnover for small vendors is a good way, but although the turnover will increase with the increase in people's purchases, it will always have a certain limit within a certain period of time, and it will inevitably squeeze back and forth between state-owned, cooperative, joint venture, and small vendors. Can we adopt appropriate methods of adjusting handling fees to make up for the shortfall? If there are still difficulties, the method of closing stores and absorbing personnel can be used to solve them. (3) Since liberation, some industrial and commercial households have closed down either because they do not meet the needs of the people or because of poor management and losses. There are also shareholders of enterprises who have no occupation, are over middle age, or are widowed, old, weak, or have no special skills. These two types of people are not large in number, but they are all eager to be able to take up a job and transform themselves into self-reliant laborers. Can each professional company be responsible for investigating such people and gradually arranging them?
  (4) It is hoped that the various measures proposed by Vice Premier Chen Yun can be implemented simultaneously with the fixed interest rate method in various places to strengthen the unity between large, medium, and small industrialists and businessmen.
    Among the joint ventures, there are many good examples of the public and private sectors getting along, but there are also bad ones. The more common ones are "mutual respect as guests" and "peace and quiet" (some are without disputes, some are without anything to do). Although the distance is much closer, it still remains in form, and the ideological distance has changed very little. The main reason is that there is a lack of sufficient understanding of the changes in the current class relations in our country (the working class and the national bourgeoisie). China's main bourgeoisie—the bureaucratic bourgeoisie—has been eliminated by the New Democratic Revolution. The remaining national bourgeoisie sympathized with or were neutral to the revolution before liberation. After liberation, they participated in the people's democratic regime under the leadership of the working class. Through the "Five-Anti" movement, they clearly realized the leadership of the working class. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, they accepted processing and ordering. The state put forward the general task of the transition period, and they began to understand the policy of peaceful transformation. Thanks to Chairman Mao's teachings last winter, industrialists and businessmen were asked to understand the laws of social development and control their own destiny. This year, with the high tide of the socialist transformation of agriculture, private industrial and commercial enterprises across the country basically implemented joint state-private ownership. This is due to the fact that the international socialist system is advancing victoriously, the domestic working class is growing stronger, the people's democratic regime is becoming increasingly consolidated, and the state-owned economy is developing rapidly. Under such an objectively favorable situation, the understanding of industrialists and businessmen has gradually improved, and they are becoming more and more aligned with the working class. Especially after the enterprises were merged and fixed interest rates were implemented, production was incorporated into the state plan, overcoming the blindness of anarchy; the restricted exploitation was expressed in the form of redemption. The contradiction between social production and private ownership of the means of production has been basically resolved. The remaining problems are ideological transformation and the final abandonment of exploitation. Therefore, the policy of peaceful transformation is not only possible, but is already being practiced in real life. Now the state has adopted measures such as fixed interest rates, taking care of life difficulties, and taking over personnel, which further provides material conditions for industrialists and businessmen to accept transformation. If we industrialists and businessmen want to transform into members of the working class, we must not only look at the immediate interests, but also for the sake of future interests, we must abandon our inherent bourgeois viewpoints and accept the proletarian viewpoints. This is a serious, profound, and arduous process of ideological struggle. However, is it possible that the nature of the current class relations has changed from antagonistic contradictions to non-antagonistic contradictions due to China's historical conditions and the fact that the whole country has begun to enter a socialist society, and therefore can be resolved by different methods? Or is it that although the nature of the contradictions has not changed, can they be resolved by different methods due to the different specific circumstances of our country? Or is it something else? We hope that Marxist-Leninist scholars, philosophers, and social scientists can give us more theoretical guidance and help to correct our understanding, so that we can learn to observe and analyze the contradictions of things, understand the methods of resolving contradictions, eliminate existing ideological concerns, and better play an active role in our work. This is not only conducive to the transformation of industrialists and businessmen, but also greatly conducive to the victorious completion of our country's socialist revolution.
    The above are some opinions on the issue of giving play to enthusiasm. Please criticize and correct any errors or inappropriateness.

    更好地发挥各方面的积极作用
    ——荣毅仁代表的发言
    李先念副总理的报告，反映了国家计划在1955年执行中的成就，根据提前完成和超额完成五年计划的要求提出了1956年的预算，并且指出了为实现这个预算而努力的方向。我听了这个报告，感到非常满意，并表示同意。
    李副总理说“地方财政是整个国家财政的重要构成部分”，这次国家预算中间的地方预算，是由各地人民委员会提出的，当然能够符合各地的要求，但是为了加强地方财政工作的主动性和积极性，我认为今后地方编制预算，可以先由地方各级人民委员会按照各地年度计划的具体情况拟订预算，提交地方人民代表大会讨论，以求得更广泛的群众意见，更好地发挥地方人民代表大会的作用，再呈报中央，由中央审核增减，统筹平衡，列入国家预算。这样，能“使中央的统一领导、统一计划的原则，同地方的分级负责，因地制宜的原则结合起来”，更好地发挥各方面的为实现国家预算而努力的积极作用。
    报告中提到为了适应经济发展的需要，将要大量培养熟练工人，今年十七个部的计划就将达到71万人，这是十分令人兴奋的事。如上海过去几年来输送了大量技术人员、熟练工人支援各地建设，亦培养了一定数量的技工。今后当然还要发挥它的作用，可是为了向科学进军，城市青年已经大部就学，培养人才的来源感到缺乏。政府过去为了防止影响农业生产，曾作出了劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示，这是完全必要的。在新形势之下，为了培养技工的需要，可否有计划的招收农村青年，加以培养，使得城市既可以输送干部支援国家建设，又可以补充新的力量满足生产上的需要。同时，几年来，像上海的技术人员抽得很多，补得太少，大专毕业学生分配到上海的寥寥可数（特别是电机、机械方面），这对发挥原有工业基地的作用有一定程度的影响，希望主管部门能够加以注意，合理分配。
    政府为了贯彻和平改造的政策，认真做好对私营工商业的社会主义改造工作，关心工商业者的生活，陈云副总理的发言，提出了各项具体办法。这样的关怀照顾，可说是无微不至，作为工商业者之一的我，表示衷心的拥护，并就这方面提出一些具体的意见，以供参考。（一）小业主的房屋在上海有大部分是租来的，小业主原来家店不分，租金由企业支出，如在划分以后，拟请予以照顾，租金仍由企业支付，以免增加负担影响生活。（二）对小商贩的供应货源，增加营业额，这是好办法，但营业额虽然会随着人民购买的增长而增长，在一定时期内总有一定限度，就不免在国营、合作社、合营、小商贩之间挤来挤去。可否采用适当调整手续费的办法，以补不足。如再有困难，则用撤店、吸收人员的办法来解决。（三）解放以后，有部分工商业户，或因不符合人民  的需要，或因经营不善亏损困难而致歇业。也有的企业股东，没有职业，年龄已是中年以上，或是鳏寡老弱，并无特殊技能。这两种人数不多，但都迫切要求能够走上工作岗位，使自己能够改造成为自食其力的劳动者。这样的人，可否请由各专业公司分别负责调查，逐步予以安排。
  （四）陈云副总理所提出的各项办法，希望各地能与定息的办法，同时予以贯彻，以加强大、中、小工商业者之间的团结。
    关于合营企业中公私双方相处的中间，好的例子不少，坏的亦有，比较普遍的，是“相敬如宾”，“相安无事”，（有的是没有争论，有的是无事可做），虽然距离是接近了不少，但是还停留在形式上，思想上的距离很少改变。主要的是对我国当前的阶级关系（工人阶级与民族资产阶级）的变化，缺乏足够的认识。中国主要的资产阶级——官僚资产阶级，已为新民主主义革命所消灭。剩下的民族资产阶级，在解放前对革命同情或是中立，解放后，在工人阶级领导下，参加了人民民主政权。通过“五反”运动，明确的认识了工人阶级的领导。在国营经济领导下，接受了加工定货。国家提出了过渡时期总任务，开始懂得了和平改造的政策。由于去冬毛主席的教导，要工商业者认识社会发展规律，掌握自己的命运，在今年又随着农业社会主义改造的高潮，基本上全国的私营工商业实行了公私合营。这是在国际上社会主义体系正在胜利地向前迈进、国内工人阶级日益壮大、人民民主政权日益巩固、国营经济迅速发展这样的客观有利形势之下，工商业者的认识逐步提高，愈来愈靠拢工人阶级。特别是在企业合营，实行定息以后，生产纳入了国家计划，克服了无政府状态的盲目性；被限制了的剥削，表现为赎买的形式。基本上解决了社会生产和生产资料私人占有制的矛盾。剩下的问题是思想改造和最后放弃剥削。因此，和平改造政策不仅是可能，而已是实践在现实的生活中间。现在国家采取了定息，照顾生活困难，人事包下来等等的办法，更进一步为工商业者接受改造提供了物质条件。我们工商业者要转变成为工人阶级的成员，就不是单看着眼前的利益，而是要为着将来的利益，就必须抛弃我们固有的资产阶级观点而接受无产阶级的观点。这是严肃、深刻而艰巨的思想斗争过程。但是当前的阶级关系，是否由于中国的历史条件，全国开始进入社会主义社会，可以由原来的对抗性的矛盾发展成为非对抗性的矛盾，而由于矛盾的性质发生了变化，因此可以用不相同的方法来解决呢？还是矛盾的性质虽然并没有变化，但是由于我国的具体情况不同，因此可以用不同的方法来解决呢？还是其他呢？像这样的问题，希望马列主义学者，哲学社会科学工作者，能够多多的在理论上给我们以指导和帮助，来端正我们的认识，使我们能够学会观察和分析事物的矛盾，懂得解决矛盾的方法，消除存在的思想顾虑，更好地在工作中发挥积极性，这不但是有利于工商业者的改造，而且大有利于我国社会主义革命事业的胜利完成。
    以上就有关发挥积极性的问题，提出几点意见，错误的、不妥的地方，请各位代表批评指正。
