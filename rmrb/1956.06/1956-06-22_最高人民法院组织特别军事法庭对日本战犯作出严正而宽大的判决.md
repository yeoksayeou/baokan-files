Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: The Special Military Tribunal organized by the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China, based on the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the handling of war criminals of the Japanese war of aggression against China, promulgated by Chairman Mao Zedong, conducted trials on June 9th to June 20th in Shenyang and Taiyuan respectively on seventeen war criminals involved in the cases of Suzuki Keikyu, Tominaga Juntaro, and Shirono Hiroshi.

The result of the trials was the sentencing of the seventeen war criminals to fixed-term imprisonment.

The case tried in Shenyang involved eight Japanese war criminals: Suzuki Keikyu, Fujita Shigeru, Uesaka Masaru, Sasa Sanosuke, Nagashima Tsutomu, Funaki Kenjiro, Sakakibara Hideo, and Uno Shintaro. These eight former Japanese army servicemen committed crimes of resolutely carrying out the war of aggression and violating the principles of international law and humanitarianism during the Japanese war of aggression against China.

Two cases were tried in Taiyuan: one case was the case of Tominaga Juntaro involving war crimes and espionage crimes during the Japanese war of aggression against China and after the war; the other case was the case of former Japanese military and political personnel Shirono Hiroshi and eight other war criminals. These eight defendants were Shirono Hiroshi, Sagara Keiji, Kikuchi Shuichi, Nagatomi Hiroyuki, Sumioka Yoshiichi, Ono Taiji, Kasa Minoru, and Jinno Hisayoshi. In various capacities as Japanese military and political officials, they participated in the war of aggression against China, violating the principles of international law and humanitarianism. After Japan's surrender, they committed the crimes of organizing former Japanese soldiers on Chinese territory to participate in Yan Xishan's counter-revolutionary army, opposing the Chinese people's liberation war, and plotting the revival of Japanese militarism.

In the Special Military Tribunal, the state prosecutor solemnly accused the criminals, and many witnesses and victims confirmed the serious crimes committed by these criminals. Faced with a wealth of conclusive evidence, all defendants bowed their heads and confessed their guilt.

The court gave each defendant full opportunity to present their opinions and had lawyers defend them.

Based on the reasons presented by the defense lawyers and the defendants' expressions of repentance, the Special Military Tribunal, in accordance with the spirit of the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, made a solemn and lenient judgment on these seventeen Japanese war criminals.

The Special Military Tribunal sentenced Suzuki Keikyu and Tominaga Juntaro to twenty years in prison each, Fujita Shigeru, Uesaka Masaru, and Shirono Hiroshi to eighteen years in prison each, Jinno Hisayoshi to eight years in prison, and the remaining criminals were sentenced to prison terms ranging from eleven to sixteen years. The court ruled that the terms of imprisonment for all defendants would be calculated from the date of the judgment, and the number of days of detention before the judgment would be counted as one day for one day of imprisonment.
