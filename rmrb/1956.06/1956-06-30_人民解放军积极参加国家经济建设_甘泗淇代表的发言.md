    The People's Liberation Army Actively Participates in National Economic Construction
    — Speech by Representative Gan Siqi
    I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. Now I will only express some opinions on the national budget and the army's participation in national construction.
    First, regarding the national budget.
    The 1956 national budget stipulates that defense expenditure is 6,141,391,000 yuan, a decrease of 5.52% compared with the previous year's defense expenditure final accounts. The proportion of defense expenditure in the 1956 national expenditure budget is 19.98%, a decrease of 2.17% compared with the proportion of defense expenditure in the 1955 expenditure final accounts. However, the expenditure on economic construction in 1956 increased by 17.04% compared with the 1955 final accounts, and the expenditure on cultural and educational affairs also increased by 18.36%. I think such an allocation of the national budget is entirely appropriate.
    The people of the whole country are striving with unparalleled labor enthusiasm to build our country into a great socialist country. In order to realize China's socialist industrialization, we must concentrate all financial, material, and human resources as much as possible and invest them in national economic construction. This is how China's first Five-Year Plan was implemented, and it has already achieved brilliant results. Now, the 1956 national budget has further tightened expenditures in other areas and increased investment in economic construction and cultural construction, which will enable China's industrialization to develop at a faster rate, and China's national defense modernization will inevitably be more powerfully guaranteed with the gradual realization of national industrialization. This approach is undoubtedly sincerely supported by the people of the whole country, including all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.
    In order to ensure the needs of national defense construction within the scope of this year's defense budget, our army must continue to practice diligence and thrift, tighten expenditures, so as to use funds in the most necessary areas. In 1955, we already made some achievements in this regard. The annual defense expenditure only accounted for 90.36% of the budget. This was due to the fact that, on the one hand, the accumulated surplus from previous years was cleared up and used to offset part of the budget allocation; on the other hand, it was the result of the entire army practicing diligence and thrift and tightening expenditures. According to the settlement, the entire army saved a total of 180 million yuan last year. This includes: 1.4 million square meters of barracks built by officers and soldiers themselves; 10% of fuel saved by carrying out safe driving and rationalization proposal activities; old items recovered, repaired and then reissued, and some troops wearing cotton clothes for an extra year, which saved 130,000 pairs of leather shoes, 130,000 hats, and 1.33 million sets of cotton clothes, etc. This year, we should adopt various more effective measures in ideological education and material management based on past experience to achieve more results in saving work.
    Second, regarding the army's participation in national economic construction.
    The main task of our army today is to strengthen combat readiness training and vigilantly defend the motherland. At the same time, however, our army is also using all means to actively participate in and support the economic construction of the motherland. Over the past year, inspired by the upsurge of socialism, the vast number of officers and soldiers of our army have consciously and voluntarily used their spare time outside of training to participate in voluntary labor for socialist construction; and have saved part of their salaries and allowances to support the country's industrialization and agricultural cooperativization. Now, I would like to give a brief overview of the situation in this regard:
      (1) Purchasing national economic construction bonds. The estimated number of bonds sold in the army this year has doubled compared with last year, that is, from 10 million yuan to 20 million yuan. As of now, the entire army has purchased 30,579,060 yuan, exceeding the estimated number by 52.9%, and has paid 21,151,000 yuan.
      (2) Donating funds to establish tractor stations. The entire army plans to raise funds from officers and soldiers to establish 30 tractor stations that can cultivate 2.75 million mu of land in the three years from 1956 to 1958. At present, the number of donations has reached 68% of the plan, and 11 large tractor stations that can cultivate 200,000 mu of land can be established. Under the planning of the Ministry of Agriculture, the first tractor station has been established in Qiao'ergou, east of Yan'an City, and the staff of the station has also been equipped. It is currently renovating houses and roads, and will soon be able to serve the local agricultural cooperatives. In addition, many officers and soldiers have donated agricultural tools. Around the Spring Festival this year, the troops stationed in many areas carried double-wheeled double-shared plows, threshers, weeding machines, etc., decorated with red ribbons and knots, to agricultural cooperatives. The troops stationed in Guangzhou and Kunming alone donated more than 6,200 pieces of various agricultural tools. Many cooperatives distributed the agricultural tools donated by the army to the most skilled members for safekeeping and use, and named the plows donated by the army "August 1st Plows," and named the plows donated by some military officers' families "March 8th Plows," "Children's Number," etc. Army officers and soldiers also saved their salaries and allowances and sent them back to their families to subsidize their family members' investment in cooperatives. The officers and soldiers of the "Tashan Heroic Regiment" alone sent back more than 30,000 yuan, and wrote more than 4,000 letters to their families and relatives to promote the benefits of cooperativization.
    (3) Participating in voluntary labor. Many troops have signed contracts with local cooperatives to help cooperatives deliver manure, dig pond mud, select seeds, cultivate land, sow, and harvest, etc., using their spare time and holidays. For example, troops in a certain area of Zhejiang helped cooperatives reclaim wasteland and plant fruit trees, and the cooperative members named the orchard cultivated by the joint efforts of the army and civilians "Friendship Orchard." During the summer harvest this year, many troops in Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Anhui, Shaanxi and other provinces immediately stopped training after receiving heavy rain warnings and helped farmers rush to harvest wheat in the rain. A certain troop in Jinan mobilized more than 16,000 people in three days and rushed to harvest more than 10,000 mu of crops. A certain armored unit also mobilized 30,000 people to help local farmers rush to harvest. In helping the people build water conservancy projects, many people from soldiers to generals in the units stationed in Beijing participated in the construction of the Yongding River water diversion project, including participation in other construction projects in the capital, for a total of 120,000 working days. Troops stationed on Hainan Island helped build seawalls to prevent tides. The agencies, schools and troops stationed in Nanjing helped build a reservoir under Zijin Mountain with a storage capacity of 190,000 cubic meters, which the local people named "Army-Civilian Friendship Reservoir." They said: "Don't forget the reservoir builders when using water, and always remember the People's Liberation Army." There are many more cases of helping to build small-scale water conservancy projects, such as repairing canals and digging wells.
    (4) Planting trees and afforestation. Under the call to green the motherland, troops have launched a large-scale tree planting and afforestation movement from Dachen Island in the East China Sea to the border areas in the Northwest and Southwest, from the coast of the South China Sea to the grasslands of Mongolia. The troops on the Fujian front planted 10.45 million trees, planting them at night when the enemy bombed them during the day. The troops stationed in Zhoushan also planted a large number of trees to green the archipelago. On the Loess Plateau in Gansu, officers and soldiers planted trees in the face of overwhelming sandstorms. Troops in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shenyang and other places have planted shelterbelts. People in Wuhan, Changsha, Qingdao and other places call the areas where troops plant trees "August 1st Forest," "Soldier Forest," and "Hero Forest." A certain garrison planted a memorial forest for new recruits, and some veterans of some units planted trees around the駐地 before demobilization as a souvenir.
    (5) Participating in the elimination of the four pests. According to statistics from more than 50 large and small units alone, more than 1 million rats and sparrows have been captured. In order to eliminate schistosomiasis, the troops stationed in Shanghai once mobilized nearly 10,000 officers and soldiers to eliminate snails. The troops and militiamen stationed in Jiangxi eliminated more than 80,000 tigers, wolves, wild boars and other large and small pests.
    (6) Assisting in rural cultural construction. Many troops assist agricultural cooperatives in running primary schools, nurseries, and medical clinics, and donate books to establish libraries, and help agricultural cooperatives establish telephone networks and broadcasting networks. For example, in the suburbs of Tianjin, under the cooperation of the army and civilians, 46 townships have achieved "every township has a telephone and every village has a broadcast." On the day the network was built, a broadcast conference attended by 130,000 people was held to celebrate.
    (7) Rescuing and relieving disasters. In April this year, the troops stationed in Guangdong and Hainan Island participated in the drought resistance work on a large scale. Since May, some areas have been hit by heavy rains, and armies everywhere have actively participated in flood prevention and rushing to harvest. On May 4, there was heavy rain in the Yuejiayuan Township area of Jinghai County, Hebei Province. The water level of the canal rose sharply and breached the irrigation canal. More than 200 officers and soldiers of a certain garrison, in the emergency situation of not having flood control equipment, jumped into the water and formed a "human gate" to fight the flood for more than two hours until the materials were delivered to plug the breach.
    (8) Others, such as organizing work teams to assist local areas in establishing and rectifying societies, assisting in training accountants and medical personnel, and troops stationed in ethnic minority areas assisting fraternal ethnic groups in production, have achieved certain results.
    In addition, the railway soldiers are working hard to build the Yingxia Railway. With the strong support of the people, they are working selflessly to ensure that it will be completed within this year, one year ahead of schedule. Road construction troops in Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai and other places are building roads on the plateau, which is of great significance to national construction.
    The above is some of the work that our army has done in participating in and supporting national construction in the past year. However, we deeply feel that there are still many shortcomings in carrying out these tasks. This is mainly because we lack more comprehensive investigation and research and careful planning, so that such situations often occur: the enthusiasm of the vast number of officers and soldiers of the troops is very high, but the leadership has not been able to make appropriate arrangements in a timely manner based on the specific situation of the troops themselves. As a result, some have caused certain waste, and some have even achieved half the result with twice the effort. At the same time, what should arouse our serious vigilance is that in the past year, in terms of army-civilian relations, some behaviors that have harmed the interests of the people have occurred in the army. For example, some troops did not consult enough with local governments and people in the construction of national defense projects, barracks and training grounds, and occupied too much land; some troops did not do a good job in safety measures during combat exercises, and some accidents of accidental injury to residents occurred; many car drivers violated the rules of safe driving and caused many military vehicle accidents, causing loss of life and property to the people; and some personnel did not respect local party and government organs and people's organizations enough. These are all absolutely incompatible with our army's tradition of supporting the government and loving the people. In order to further strengthen army-civilian relations and give full play to our army's role in socialist construction, we must wage a resolute struggle against our mistakes and shortcomings, and hope that all representatives will supervise and criticize us at any time so that we can effectively correct our shortcomings and improve our work.
    Dear representatives: American imperialism is still occupying our territory Taiwan, continuing to expand its arms and prepare for war, and obstructing the easing of the international situation. Therefore, our national defense forces must be further strengthened. All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army must always maintain a high degree of vigilance, conscientiously implement combat readiness training, strengthen the modernization of our army, and continue to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, the defense of the motherland, and the maintenance of peace in the Far East and the world!

    人民解放军积极参加国家经济建设
    ——甘泗淇代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告和廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明。现在我仅就国家预算和军队参加国家建设问题发表一些意见。
    第一，关于国家预算问题。
    1956年度国家预算规定国防费支出为6，141，391，000元，比上年国防费决算数减少了5.52％。1956年国防费在国家支出预算中所占的比重为19.98％，比1955年国防费在支出决算中所占的比重下降了2.17％。而1956年经济建设的支出则较1955年的决算数增长了17.04％，文教费的支出也增长了18.36％。我认为国家预算作这样的分配，是完全适当的。
    全国人民正以无比的劳动热情，为建设我国成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。为了实现我国的社会主义工业化，就必须尽可能地集中一切财力、物力和人力，投入国家的经济建设中去。我国第一个五年计划就是这样做的，而且已经取得了光辉的成就。现在，1956年的国家预算又进一步紧缩了其他一些方面的开支，增加了对经济建设和文化建设的投资，这将使我国的工业化以更快的速度向前发展，我国的国防现代化也必将随着国家工业化的逐步实现而获得更有力的保证。这样办，无疑是全国人民、也是人民解放军全体官兵所竭诚拥护的。
  为了在今年的国防费预算范围内，确实保证国防建设的需要，我军必须继续厉行精简节约，紧缩开支，以便把经费用到最必需的方面去。1955年度，我们已经在这方面做出了一些成绩，全年国防费的支出仅占预算数的90.36％。这是由于一方面清理了历年结余，抵拨了一部分预算拨款；另一方面则是全军上下厉行节约、紧缩开支的结果。根据结算，去年全军共节约了18，000万元。其中包括：由官兵自己动手修建的营房140万平方米；开展安全行车和合理化建议等运动节约油料10％；将旧品收回加以修理后再发下去，一部分部队将棉衣多穿一年，采取这种办法计节省皮鞋13万双，帽子13万顶，棉衣133万套，等等。今年，我们应当根据以往的经验，在思想教育上、物资管理上，采取各种更有效的措施，使节约工作做出更多的成绩。
  第二，关于军队参加国家经济建设的问题。
    今天我军所担负的任务，主要的是加强战备训练，警惕地保卫祖国。但同时，我军也在用一切办法，积极参加和支援祖国的经济建设。一年以来，我军广大官兵在社会主义高潮的鼓舞下，自觉自愿地利用操课以外的空隙时间，参加社会主义建设的义务劳动；并节省一部分薪金和津贴，来支援国家的工业化和农业的合作化。现在，我谨将这方面的情况概述如下：
      （一）认购国家经济建设公债。今年军队中推销公债的预计数目比去年增加了一倍，即由1，000万元增为2，000万元。截至目前为止，全军已认购30，579，060元，超过预计数的52.9％，并已缴款21，151，000元。
      （二）捐款建立拖拉机站。全军预计在1956年至1958年三年内，由官兵集资建立可耕275万亩土地的拖拉机站30个。目前认捐的数字已经完成计划的68％，可以建立耕地20万亩的大型拖拉机站11个。在农业部的规划下，第一个拖拉机站已在延安城东的桥儿沟建立，站的工作人员也已配齐，目前正在整修房屋和道路，很快就可以为当地的农业合作社服务。此外，还有不少官兵捐献农具，今年春节前后，许多地区的驻军抬着披红结彩的双轮双铧犁、打谷机、锄草机等送给农业合作社。仅广州和昆明两地的驻军，就捐赠了各种农具6，200多件。许多合作社把军队赠送的农具分配给技术最好的社员保管和使用，把军队送的犁命名为“八一犁”，把某些军官家属送的犁命名为“三八犁”、“儿童号”等。军队官兵还节约了薪金和津贴寄回家庭，以补助自己的家属向合作社投资。仅“塔山英雄团”的官兵就寄回了3万多元，并写了4，000多封信向家属及亲友宣传合作化的好处。
    （三）参加义务劳动。许多部队同当地合作社订了合同，利用业余和假日，帮助合作社送粪、挖塘泥、选种、耕地、播种和收割等。如浙江某地部队帮助合作社开垦荒地、种植果树，社员们把军民合作培植的果园命名为“友谊果园”。今年夏收的时候，山东、江苏、河南、安徽、陕西等省的许多部队，在得到暴雨警报后，立即停止操课，冒雨帮助农民抢收麦子。济南某部队三天内出动了16，000多人，抢收了1万多亩庄稼，装甲兵某部也出动了3万人工，帮助当地农民抢收。在帮助人民兴修水利方面，驻京机关部队，从士兵到将军有很多人参加了永定河引水工程的修建，连参加首都的其他建设在内，共为12万个劳动日。驻海南岛部队帮助修筑了防潮海堤。驻南京的机关、学校和部队，帮助修建了紫金山下蓄水19万立方公尺的水库，当地人民命名为“军民友谊库”，他们说：“用水不忘修库人，时刻怀念解放军”。其他帮助修建小型水利工程，如修渠、挖井等则更多。
    （四）植树造林。在绿化祖国的号召下，从东海的大陈岛到西北、西南的边疆，从南海的海滨到蒙古的草原，部队展开了一个大规模的植树造林运动。福建前线部队种树1，045万株，白天敌人炮轰，就在夜里种植。驻舟山部队亦大量植树绿化该群岛。在甘肃的黄土高原上，官兵们冒着弥天风沙种树。新疆、内蒙、沈阳等地部队都种植了防护林。武汉、长沙、青岛等地人民称部队植树的地段为“八一林”，“战士林”、“英雄林”。某地驻军种植了新兵入伍纪念林，有些单位的老兵，复员前还在驻地周围种树留念。
    （五）参加除四害。仅据50多个大小单位的统计，捕捉到的老鼠和麻雀就有100多万只。为了消灭血吸虫病，上海驻军曾经出动了近万名官兵消灭钉螺。江西驻军和民兵消灭虎、狼、野猪及其他大小害兽即达8万多只。
    （六）协助农村文化建设。不少部队协助农业合作社开办小学校、托儿所、医疗室，并捐赠图书成立图书馆，帮助农业合作社建立电话网、广播网。如天津市郊在军民合作下即有46个乡，已经做到“乡乡有电话、村村有广播”，当架成的那天，举行了有13万人参加的广播大会进行庆祝。
    （七）抢险救灾。今年4月，广东及海南岛驻军大规模地参加了抗旱工作。5月份以来，某些地区天降暴雨，各地军队又积极参加了防汛抢收。5月4日，河北静海县岳家园乡一带大雨，运河水位猛涨，冲决了灌溉渠，驻军某部官兵200多人在没有防汛器材的紧急情况下，跳下水去，结成“人闸”，与洪水搏斗了两个多小时，直到材料运到把决口堵住。
    （八）其他如组织工作队协助地方进行建社、整社，协助培养会计和医疗人员，驻在少数民族地区部队协助兄弟民族生产等，都有一定的成绩。
    此外，铁道兵部队正在紧张地进行鹰厦线铁路的修建。他们在人民大力支援下，忘我地劳动，保证提前一年，在今年内完成。西藏、新疆、青海等地修路部队，正在高原上修筑公路，这对于国家建设是具有重大意义的。
    以上就是我军一年来参加和支援国家建设中所做的一些工作。但我们深深觉得，在进行这些工作中缺点还很多。这主要是由于我们缺乏更全面的调查研究和周密的计划，以致常常出现这样的情况：部队广大官兵的热情非常高，而领导上却未能及时地根据部队本身的具体情况，作妥帖的安排。结果，有的造成了某些浪费，有的甚至事倍功半。同时更应引起我们严重警惕的是，一年来在军民关系方面，军队中曾发生过一些损害人民利益的行为。如有的部队在国防工程、营房和训练场地的修建中，与当地政府及人民协商不够，占地过多；有的部队在战斗演习中安全措施做得不好，发生了一些误伤居民的事故；有不少的汽车司机违反安全行车的守则，发生了不少的军车肇祸事件，造成人民生命财产的损失；也还有某些人员对地方党政机关和人民团体尊重不够等。这些都是与我军拥政爱民的传统绝不相容的。为了进一步地密切军民关系，充分发挥我军在社会主义建设中的作用，我们必须对自己的错误和缺点作坚决的斗争，并希望各位代表随时加以监督和批评，以便我们能够有效地纠正缺点，改进工作。
    各位代表：美国帝国主义现在还侵占着我国的领土台湾，继续扩军备战，阻挠国际局势的缓和。因此，我们的国防力量还必须进一步增强。中国人民解放军的全体官兵一定要永远保持高度的警惕，兢兢业业地实施战备训练，加强我军的现代化建设，为解放台湾、保卫祖国、维护远东与世界和平而继续奋斗！
