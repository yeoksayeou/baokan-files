    The "June 1st" International Children's Day has arrived. Under the care of all sectors of society, children in New China live happy and fulfilling lives. The vigorous development of our country's socialist construction and the creative labor of the national working people have changed and are changing the face of the country, creating better conditions for the healthy physical and mental development of children. In recent years, China's child health and childcare services have been widely developed. In 1955, there was an average of 2.1 schools in each township nationwide. Starting this year, within twelve years, the new generation will all be able to receive compulsory education. There are already 137 after-school education institutions for children nationwide. A new social atmosphere of caring for and loving children is gradually being established. More and more parents have begun to adopt correct views and methods to educate their children. China's new generation is growing up in a good social environment.
    Children are the future of the motherland. To cultivate them into well-rounded new people is a complex and meticulous task involving many aspects. Our country's social system, as well as the fresh things that are constantly emerging on various fronts, provide very favorable conditions and extremely rich content for cultivating socialist new people. However, these favorable conditions have not yet been fully utilized to educate and influence children. This is mainly because the several aspects of communist education for children—schools, Young Pioneers, families, and society—have not been well organized.
    Schools are the main battleground for educating children. In recent years, schools have done a lot of work and made great achievements in implementing the educational policy of all-round development and improving the quality of education. In the future, we should continue to improve this work, paying attention to strengthening the connection between school education and life and production, increasing children's knowledge of productive labor, and cultivating children's labor habits and skills. Through teaching and various activities, we must cultivate children to have cheerful, lively, and courageous personalities and a spirit of innovation. We must strengthen guidance for students' extracurricular and after-school life and create some necessary conditions to enrich children's spare time. Schools and families should have close ties. Teachers and parents should be good at attracting students to care about major national and social events, care about the development of local industrial and agricultural production, and, without hindering their studies and health, support and guide students to carry out some social work within their capabilities so that they can breathe with the entire society. All relevant sectors of society should also give enthusiastic support and assistance to schools and students' activities to the best of their ability.
    The Young Pioneers is an organization of children themselves. This organization has now grown to more than 25 million members and plays a good role in uniting and educating the vast number of children. The Communist Youth League organizations and teachers and counselors should help the Young Pioneers organize their lives more actively and richly. We must give full play to the children's initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity, and guide them to do things well on their own. The activities of the Young Pioneers should bring children fresh knowledge, vivid and pleasant impressions, close comradeship, and awaken their desire to study, work, and live better for the motherland and the people. We must gradually overcome the empty and abstract preaching and the old-fashioned practices in the Young Pioneers' activities.
    After-school education institutions for children are the after-school homes for children and places for communist education. Through the activities of after-school education institutions for children, we can enrich children's lives, broaden their horizons, enrich their knowledge, train their labor skills, develop their interests and creative talents in science, technology, sports, art, etc., cultivate their enthusiasm and initiative towards society and politics, and cultivate their ability to act independently. In the entire cause of children's education, after-school education institutions for children are an indispensable part. However, some units do not recognize its significance and do not pay enough attention to its development. Although there are already 137 after-school education institutions for children nationwide, the types are very few, the scale is very small, and the equipment is very simple, which is far from meeting the needs of children. In the future, with the development of the country's economic construction, all localities (especially cities) should actively establish some after-school education institutions for children in light of local conditions, enrich and improve the equipment of existing after-school education institutions for children, and strengthen the leadership of after-school education institutions for children so that the after-school education work for children can be better established and developed.
    It is very meaningful for various agencies and systems to carry out after-school education work for children according to their own business characteristics. For example, the Harbin Railway Administration recently specially built a children's railway for children, and the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Power Industry will build an automated Young Pioneers hydroelectric power station in Beijing for children to learn to manage and operate themselves. This kind of specialized after-school education institution for children is of great benefit to spreading scientific and technological knowledge, developing children's interests and talents, and cultivating children's ideals. In addition, various business departments can also hold some regular and irregular activities for children, such as various science activities held by the Science Popularization Associations in various places for children, and the aviation summer camp held by the Communist Youth League Committee of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics for middle school students. These are all good things worth promoting.
    Adult cultural centers, libraries, and workers' clubs and other social cultural institutions have also achieved certain results in carrying out after-school education work for children. However, there are still many adult social cultural institutions that have not established children's departments, and some cultural centers and reading rooms even refuse to allow children with reading ability to enter. These are all inappropriate. In the future, cultural centers, libraries, and clubs with conditions should open children's reading rooms and other children's activity places. Clubs with a relatively large scale can consider attaching comprehensive children's activity places like Children's Homes to organize various activities for children. Movie theaters and theaters should show and perform movies and dramas suitable for children to watch as much as possible, and parks should add children's playgrounds.
    In the past year, children's care workers, children's education workers, writers, artists, scientists, and all sectors of society have contributed their strength and made many achievements in cultivating children into socialist new people. Our country has basically completed the socialist transformation, and has also made great progress in socialist industrialization. The conditions for developing children's education are getting better year by year. We should make full use of these conditions to do a better and more outstanding job in children's education.

### 教育儿童是全社会的责任

    教育儿童是全社会的责任
    “六一”国际儿童节来到了。新中国的儿童在社会各方面的关怀下，生活是愉快的、幸福的。我国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，全国劳动人民创造性的劳动，改变了和正在改变着国家的面貌，给儿童身心的健康发展创造了更好的条件。近年来，我国的儿童保健和保育事业有了广泛发展，1955年全国平均每个乡已经有二点一所学校，从今年开始，在十二年内，新的一代人人都可以受到义务教育了；全国已经有137处儿童校外教育机关；关怀和爱护儿童的新的社会风气正在逐步树立起来；越来越多的父母已经注意采用正确的观点和方法来教育子女。我国的新一代在良好的社会环境当中成长着。
    儿童是祖国的未来。要培养他们成为全面发展的新人，是一个关联到许多方面的复杂细致的工作。我们国家的社会制度，以及各个战线上不断涌现的新鲜的事物，为培养社会主义的新人提供了非常有利的条件和极其丰富的内容。但是这些有利的条件还没有被充分地运用来教育和影响儿童，这主要是因为对儿童进行共产主义教育的几个方面——学校，少先队，家庭和社会——还没有很好地组织起来。
    学校是教育儿童的主要阵地。近年来，学校在贯彻执行全面发展的教育方针、提高教育质量方面做了许多工作，也有很大成绩。今后应当继续改进这方面的工作，注意加强学校教育同生活和生产的联系，增进儿童的生产劳动知识，培养儿童的劳动习惯和技能；并且通过教学和各种活动，培养儿童具有开朗、活泼、勇敢的性格和创造精神。要加强对学生课外和校外生活的指导，为丰富儿童的课余生活创设一些必要的条件。学校和家庭应该有密切的联系，教师和家长要善于吸引学生去关心国家和社会的重大事件，关心当地工农业生产的发展情况，并且在不妨碍他们的学习和健康的条件下，支持和指导学生进行一些力所能及的社会工作，使他们和整个社会共同呼吸。社会各有关方面也应该在自己力所能及的范围内给学校和学生的活动以热情的支持和帮助。
    少先队是少年儿童自己的组织，这个组织现在已经发展到二千五百多万队员，在团结和教育广大少年儿童中起着良好的作用。青年团组织和教师、辅导员们要帮助少先队把生活组织得更加活跃，更加丰富些。要很好地发挥孩子们的主动性、积极性和创造性，引导他们自己作主去办好事情。要使少先队的活动能够带给孩子们新鲜的知识，生动愉快的印象，亲密的同志情谊，和唤起孩子们为祖国为人民而更好地学习、工作和生活的愿望，要逐渐地克服少先队活动中空洞抽象的说教和老一套的做法。
    儿童校外教育机关是儿童的校外之家，是对儿童进行共产主义教育的场所。通过儿童校外教育机关的活动，可以丰富儿童的生活，扩大儿童的眼界，丰富他们的知识，锻炼他们的劳动技能，发展他们对科学、技术、体育、艺术等方面的兴趣和创造才能，培养他们对社会、政治的积极性和主动精神，培养他们的独立活动的能力。在整个儿童教育事业中，儿童校外教育机关是不可缺少的一个部分。可是，有些单位还不认识它的意义，对于它的发展不够重视。全国虽然已经有137所儿童校外教育机关，但是种类很少，规模很小，设备也很简陋，远不能满足少年儿童的需要。今后随着国家经济建设的发展，各地（特别是城市）应该积极地因地制宜地为儿童建立一些校外教育机关，充实和改善现有儿童校外教育机关的设备，加强对儿童校外教育机关的领导，使儿童的校外教育工作更好地建立和发展起来。
    各机关各系统按照自己的业务特点，来开展儿童校外教育工作是很有意义的。例如哈尔滨铁路管理局最近为孩子们专修了一条儿童铁路，电力工业部建设总局将在北京兴建一座自动化的少先队水力发电站，由儿童自己来学习管理和操纵。这种专门性的儿童校外教育机关，对于传播科学技术知识，发展儿童的兴趣和才能，培养儿童的理想，都有很大好处。此外，各业务部门还可以为孩子们举办一些定期的、不定期的活动，如各地科学普及协会为儿童举行各种科学活动，北京航空学院团委会为中学生举办航空夏令营等，这都是值得提倡的好事情。
    成人的文化馆、图书馆以及工人俱乐部等社会文化机关在开展儿童校外教育工作上也取得了一定的成绩。但是，也还有许多成人的社会文化机关还没有设立儿童部门，甚至有些文化馆、阅览室，拒绝具有阅读能力的儿童入内。这都是不妥当的。今后有条件的文化馆、图书馆、俱乐部都应当开辟儿童阅览室等等的儿童活动场所，规模比较大的俱乐部，可以考虑附设像少年之家这样的综合性的儿童活动场所，为儿童组织各种活动。电影院、戏院尽可能放映、表演适宜于儿童看的电影和戏剧，公园应当增辟儿童游戏场。
    近一年来，儿童保育工作者、儿童教育工作者、作家、艺术家、科学家以及社会各个方面，为了培养儿童成为社会主义的新人，都贡献了自己的力量，作出了许多成绩。我们的国家已经基本上完成了社会主义改造，在社会主义工业化方面也已经有了巨大进展，发展儿童教育事业的条件一年比一年更好，我们应当充分利用这些条件，把儿童教育事业作得更好、更出色。
