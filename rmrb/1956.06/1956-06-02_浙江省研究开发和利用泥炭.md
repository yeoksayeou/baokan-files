Zhejiang Province has discovered abundant peat deposits in the soil layers of twenty-four counties including Yin County, Cixi, Yuyao, and Shaoxing. Preliminary investigations indicate that Yin County, Yuyao, Pingyang and the West Lake area of Hangzhou alone contain 6.7 million tons of peat. Currently, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture is studying the development and utilization of peat.

Peat is a very good fertilizer. According to tests by agricultural scientific research departments, the organic matter content of the peat discovered in Zhejiang is generally over 50%, with a maximum of 78%. The nitrogen content is generally over 1.5%, with a maximum of 4.77%. The nitrogen content is higher than fertilizers such as tea seed cake, tallow seed cake, fresh grass seeds, air-dried river mud, and human manure. Peat has a great fertilizing effect. It is estimated that if Zhejiang Province extracts 1.5 million tons of peat and applies it to the fields, the fertilizing effect would be equivalent to the entire amount of chemical fertilizer supplied to the province by the state this year. Last year, Zhangjiayuan Agricultural Cooperative in Yin County applied peat to its spring flower fields, and this year the cooperative's flower production increased by more than 20% compared to last year.

Zhejiang's peat is generally buried between one and two meters below the surface, but in some areas such as Hang County, Pinghu, Pingyang, and Yuyao, peat is found only a few inches below the surface. The peat in Cixi's Huangni Lake and Hangzhou's West Lake is even exposed on the surface, making it very convenient to extract. (Our Hangzhou Correspondent)

    浙江省研究开发和利用泥炭
    浙江省在鄞县、慈溪、余姚、绍兴等二十四个县的土层内，发现蕴藏着丰富的泥炭。据初步调查，仅在鄞县、余姚、平阳和杭州西湖等地就蕴藏泥炭六百七十万吨。目前，浙江省农业厅正研究开发和利用泥炭问题。
    泥炭是一种很好的肥料，据农业科学研究部门化验的结果，浙江所发现的泥炭有机质含量一般在50％以上，最高达78％，氮素含量一般在1.5％以上，最高达4.77％，氮素含量比茶籽饼、桕壳饼、鲜草籽、风干河泥、人粪尿等肥料都高；泥炭肥效很大，据计算，浙江省只要开采一百五十万吨泥炭，施到田里的肥效，就相等于今年国家供给该省全部化学肥料的肥效。鄞县张家园农业社去年春花田施了泥炭，今年全社的花比去年增产二成以上。
    浙江省泥炭一般埋藏在地皮下一公尺至二公尺之间，但有些地区如杭县、平湖、平阳、余姚等县，在地皮下几公寸就发现泥炭；慈溪黄泥湖和杭州西湖的泥炭甚至露出在地面上，开采很方便。（本报驻杭州记者）
