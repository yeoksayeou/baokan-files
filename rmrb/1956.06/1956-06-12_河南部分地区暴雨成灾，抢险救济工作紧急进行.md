Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th: From the 2nd to the 10th, the Huai River basin in Henan Province experienced continuous torrential rains. The water levels of the Huai River's main stream and tributaries rose sharply, with the water levels in many sections exceeding the highest levels of 1954. Huaibin, Xi County, and other places suffered from flooding due to the rain.

When the flood situation became critical, the Huai River management department promptly utilized existing projects to block and store floodwater, using reservoirs such as Banqiao, Baisha, Shimantan, Boshan, and Nanwan, as well as flood storage projects in depressions like Laowangpo and Jiaoting Lake. A total of over 420 million cubic meters of floodwater were blocked and stored, and water was diverted to temporary flood detention areas such as Dongda Lake, Lida Lake, and Nei River. In addition, the reinforcement of various river embankments ensured the safe discharge of floodwaters from rivers such as the Hong River and the Ru River. However, due to excessive rainfall, many small rivers overflowed and breached, and combined with internal waterlogging, some areas were affected by the disaster. In Xi County, 117 townships had water depths of more than two meters on flat ground. The local Party and government organs immediately organized manpower and boats for rescue and repair, and transferred all the farmers and livestock in these townships to higher ground. The Henan Provincial People's Committee issued two emergency instructions on flood prevention and rescue; convened a commissioner telephone conference on the 5th; allocated 200,000 yuan for emergency aid and 220,000 yuan for rescue expenses; and on the 10th, sent a delegation of condolences, carrying 20,000 yuan in relief funds and a group of medical personnel to Huaibin County to express their sympathy. They also transferred 1,900 boats from Xiping and Huangchuan counties to support Huaibin. Party and government cadres at all levels also led the broad masses in guarding the dikes day and night, reinforcing the embankments, and rushing to harvest wheat.

    河南部分地区暴雨成灾，抢险救济工作紧急进行
    据新华社郑州11日电　从二日到十日，河南省淮河流域连续暴雨，淮河干流和支流水位暴涨，好多河段的水位超过1954年的最高水位。淮滨、息县等地因雨受灾。
    当汛情紧急时，治淮部门适时地发挥了已有工程的拦蓄洪水作用，利用板桥、白沙、石漫滩、薄山、南湾等水库及老王坡、蛟停湖等洼地蓄洪工程，共拦蓄洪水四亿二千多万公方，并向东大湖、李大湖、内水河等临时滞洪区进洪，加上各河道堤防的加固，使洪河、汝河等河道的洪水得以安全下泄。但因雨水过大，有许多小河道漫溢溃决，加上内涝积水，有部分地区受灾。息县有一百一十七个乡平地水深两公尺以上，当地党政机关立即组织人力船只进行抢修，并把这些乡的农民和牲畜全部转移到高地。河南省人民委员会曾两次发出关于防汛抢险的紧急指示；在五日召开了专员电话会议；拨出二十万元的急救费和二十二万元的抢险费；十日，又派出慰问团，携带二万元的救济费，带着一批医务人员赶往淮滨县慰问；还从西平、潢川两县调一千九百只船只支援淮滨。各地党政机关干部也都领导广大群众日夜护堤，加固堤防，抢收小麦。
