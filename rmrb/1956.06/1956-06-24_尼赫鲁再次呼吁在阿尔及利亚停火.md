    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 23rd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, while passing through Syria, again called for an end to the slaughter in Algeria.
    Nehru said at a banquet in Damascus on the evening of the 21st, "We are currently witnessing the tragedy of Algeria—Algeria undoubtedly is as entitled to freedom as any other country." He said that the era in which some European countries exercised control in Asia and parts of Africa had effectively come to an end.
    He pointed out that it is impossible for people to kill each other indefinitely, and that there will eventually be a ceasefire and negotiations. "If peace is to be achieved eventually, then why not achieve it today, rather than next week, next month, next year?" Nehru said that there should be an immediate ceasefire "in order to stop the killing and seek a peaceful solution."
    Nehru said that India had very humbly put forward its suggestions on the Algerian issue, "because we believe that every problem should be resolved through peaceful means." He added, "We are not in a position to say what the detailed conditions should be; this should be determined by the people of Algeria and France."

    尼赫鲁再次呼吁在阿尔及利亚停火
    新华社23日讯　大马士革消息：印度总理尼赫鲁在路过叙利亚的时候再次呼吁停止在阿尔及利亚的屠杀。
    尼赫鲁二十一日晚上在大马士革一个招待他的宴会上说：“我们目前看到了阿尔及利亚的悲剧——阿尔及利亚无疑是像任何其他国家一样有资格获得自由的”。他说，一些欧洲国家在亚洲和在非洲的部分地方实行控制的时代实际上已经告终了。
    他指出，人们不可能无限期地互相残杀下去，终归是要停火和谈判的。“如果和平最终要实现，那么为什么不在今天就实现，而要在下星期、下个月、明年呢？”尼赫鲁说，应当立即停火，“以便停止杀戮和求得和平解决”。
    尼赫鲁说，印度十分谦恭地提出了它对阿尔及利亚问题的建议，“因为我们认为每个问题都应当通过和平方法来求得解决”。他又说，“我们不便说详细的条件应该是什么，这是应该由阿尔及利亚和法国人民来说的。”
