Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: TASS reported that the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, Marshal A.A. Grechko, told a reporter from the German News Agency that the Soviet Union is prepared to continue reducing its troops stationed in Germany if Western countries are also prepared to do so.

Grechko said: In the Soviet government's 1955 and recent decisions on disarmament, it has already been decided to reduce the number of troops stationed in Germany by more than 50,000. In 1955, the Soviet Forces in Germany disbanded twenty battalions and other combat units, totaling more than 20,000 people. Now, according to the Soviet government's new decision, the Soviet Forces in Germany will also disband an air force division, tank units, artillery teams, and other combat units, totaling approximately 33,500 people.

When the German News Agency reporter interviewed Grechko, he asked him to comment on the practical measures taken by the Soviet troops in Germany in response to the Soviet government's disarmament statement.

Grechko said that the personnel of the disbanded corps and units will be demobilized and returned to the Soviet Union, and their combat equipment will also be transported back to the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Military Command will hand over 350,000 square meters of housing and miscellaneous buildings originally used by the disbanded units to the government of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in their entirety. The expenses that the East German government must pay to maintain the Soviet troops stationed in Germany, as stipulated in the agreement, will be further reduced as a result. These saved funds can be used to further develop the economy and improve the people's welfare.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 17th dispatch from TASS: Lieutenant General Sidelnikov, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Forces in Germany, wrote a letter on the 16th to the Chiefs of Staff of the armed forces of the United States, Britain, and France in Germany, inviting them and representatives of the U.S., British, and French troops in Germany to attend the ceremony to bid farewell to the first group of disbanded Soviet military personnel. At the same time, Sidelnikov asked them to convey the invitation of Marshal Grechko, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, to the leading bodies of the trade unions of the three countries, the British Labour Party, and the French Socialist Party, as well as representatives from all walks of life in the U.S., Britain, and France, to come and participate in the send-off.

On the same day, the Soviet Garrison Commander in Berlin invited the garrison commanders of the United States, Britain, and France, as well as representatives of other countries' military missions in West Berlin, to participate in the ceremony to bid farewell to the Soviet troops.

    苏联准备继续裁减驻德部队
    如果西方国家也准备这样做的话
    驻德苏军总司令的谈话
    据新华社讯　塔斯社柏林消息：驻德苏军部队总司令安·安·格列奇科元帅向德意志通讯社记者发表谈话说，苏联准备继续裁减驻在德国的军队，如果西方国家也准备这样做的话。
    格列奇科说：在苏联政府1955年的和最近一次的裁军决定中，已经决定裁减驻德部队五万多人。在1955年，驻德苏军部队解散了二十个营和其他战斗部队共两万多人，现在，根据苏联政府的新决定，驻德苏军部队还要解散总数约达三万三千五百人的空军师、坦克部队、炮队和其他战斗部队。
    德意志通讯社记者在访问格列奇科的时候，要求他就苏联政府的裁军声明谈谈苏联驻德部队所采取的实际措施。
    格列奇科说，被解散的兵团和部队的人员将复员回苏联，他们的战斗装备也将运回苏联。
    苏军司令部将把被解散的部队原来使用的三十五万平方公尺的住房和杂用房舍完整地移交给民主德国政府，民主德国政府按照协定规定所必须付出的维持苏联驻军的费用，将因而进一步减少。这些节省出来的经费可以用于进一步发展经济和提高人民的福利。
    新华社据塔斯社柏林十七日讯：驻德苏军参谋长西杰尔尼科夫中将十六日写信给美、英、法三国驻德武装部队参谋长，请他们和美、英、法驻德军队的代表来参加送别第一批已经解散的苏军队人员的仪式。同时，西杰尔尼科夫请他们代为转达驻德苏军总司令格列奇科的邀请，请三国的工会、英国工党和法国社会党的领导机构以及美、英、法各界代表前来参加送行。
    同一天，柏林的苏军卫戍司令邀请了美、英、法三国卫戍司令以及其他国家在西柏林的军事使团的代表参加送别苏军的仪式。
