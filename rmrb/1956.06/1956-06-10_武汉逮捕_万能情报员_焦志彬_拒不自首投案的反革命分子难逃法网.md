Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th: Jiao Zhibin, a so-called "all-purpose intelligence agent" who received rigorous training in the Kuomintang's "Ministry of National Defense Second Bureau," was recently arrested by public security organs in Wuhan for refusing to surrender and continuing to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. Public security personnel seized a U.S.-made H-type portable radio used by Jiao Zhibin and a batch of radio parts, as well as a large amount of incriminating evidence such as telegraph codes, secret letters, and secret writing drugs.

The spy Jiao Zhibin began receiving formal spy training in Taiwan in 1951. By the end of 1953, he had learned a variety of espionage skills, including intelligence gathering, radio assembly, terrain surveying, explosives manufacturing, and preparation of secret writing drugs, as well as social occupational skills for engaging in espionage activities such as fitting, typesetting, and printing. Thus, he became a so-called "all-purpose intelligence agent." In March 1954, he sneaked into Wuhan from Hong Kong, attempting to lie low for a long time and wait for an opportunity to carry out activities.

After arriving in Wuhan, Jiao Zhibin tried to infiltrate state-owned enterprises, but he could not find a suitable opportunity. He also tried to disguise himself as a cigarette vendor. But this plan was quickly abandoned because he considered himself young and strong, and selling cigarettes would easily arouse suspicion. Finally, he infiltrated private enterprises, and in April 1954, he joined the private Tianfeng Chemical Factory with a share of 250 yuan, while also working in the factory.

After having a job as cover, Jiao Zhibin began his espionage activities rampantly. He used various methods to win people over and make connections. For example, in order to "establish relationships" with the people around him and probe for information, he often treated people to movies, operas, and restaurants, spending ten or eight yuan at a time without caring.

After the struggle to expose the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements began, on the surface, Jiao Zhibin's activities did not seem as rampant as before, but in reality, he more insidiously inquired about the progress of this struggle from all aspects, and actively absorbed counter-revolutionary experience and lessons from the relevant materials published in newspapers and periodicals. He repeatedly advised his espionage superiors to notify other spies to be especially careful.

Despite Jiao Zhibin being particularly careful, he still did not completely conceal his true colors. When he first started his activities, he was discovered by public security organs and the masses. Although the People's Government had repeatedly called on counter-revolutionary elements to take the path of surrendering and confessing to receive lenient treatment, this counter-revolutionary element remained unrepentant and continued to do evil. This spring, after he obtained a U.S.-made radio from his superiors, he believed that the time had come to complete the main task of setting up the radio station, and decided to take immediate action. However, this also did not escape the eyes of the masses and the public security organs. One night not long ago, just as he put on his headphones, adjusted the wavelength, and began to send a report to Taiwan, public security personnel suddenly appeared beside him and announced that he had been arrested. The spy elements who were in league with Jiao also fell into the net.

### 武汉逮捕“万能情报员”焦志彬  拒不自首投案的反革命分子难逃法网

    武汉逮捕“万能情报员”焦志彬
    拒不自首投案的反革命分子难逃法网
    新华社武汉9日电　在蒋介石特务机关“国防部二厅”受过严格训练的所谓“万能情报员”焦志彬，由于拒不自首投案、继续进行反革命活动，最近在武汉市被公安机关依法逮捕。公安人员当场缴获了焦志彬使用的美制H型轻便电台一部和一批电台零件，还查获了电报密码、密信、密写药物等许多罪证。
    特务分子焦志彬在1951年就开始在台湾接受正规的特务训练，到1953年底，已经先后学会了搜集情报、装配电台、测绘地形、制造炸药、配制密写药物等多种多样的特务伎俩，还学会了钳工、排字、印刷等从事特务活动的社会职业技能。这样，他就成为所谓“万能情报员”。1954年3月间，他从香港潜入武汉，企图长期潜伏，待机进行活动。
    焦志彬到武汉以后，曾想混入国营企业部门，但没有找到适当的机会。他也曾经想把自己打扮成为纸烟摊贩。但这个打算很快就被放弃了，因为他考虑到自己年青力壮，卖纸烟容易引起别人怀疑。最后，他混入了私营企业，并且在1954年4月间以二百五十元的股金加入了私营天丰化工厂，同时又在这个工厂里作工。
    有了职业作掩护以后，焦志彬就猖狂地开始他的特务活动。他利用各种办法来拉拢人、联络人。比如，为了和周围的人“建立感情”，刺探情报，他经常请人看电影、看戏、进馆子，一次花上十元八元也全不在意。
    揭露胡风反革命集团和肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争开始以后，从表面上看来焦志彬的活动不如过去猖狂，但实际上，他却更加阴险地从各方面探听这个斗争进行的情况，并且积极地从报刊公布的有关材料中吸取反革命的经验教训。他一再向他的特务上司献策，要特务机关通知其他特务分子特别小心。
    尽管焦志彬已经特别小心，但他仍然没有完全掩饰住狐狸尾巴，当他一开始活动的时候，就被公安机关和群众发觉了。虽然人民政府曾多次号召反革命分子走自首投案坦白从宽的道路，但是这个反革命分子仍不改悔，继续作恶。今年春天，当他把一部美制电台从他上司那里弄到手以后，认为完成架设电台这个主要任务的时机已经到来，并且决定立即行动。可是，这也没有瞒过群众的眼睛和公安机关。在不久前的一个深夜里，当他刚好戴上耳机调整波长开始向台湾发报的时候，公安人员突然出现在他的身旁，宣布他已经被逮捕。和焦犯同伙的特务分子也一同落网。
