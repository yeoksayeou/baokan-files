    Xinhua News Agency report: In Guangdong Province, where spring silkworm cocoons mature earlier, a bumper harvest has been achieved this year, and the procurement plan for the first batch of white cocoons has been overfulfilled. In other producing areas across the country, procurement work also began universally from the end of May to the beginning of June.

    The production of spring silkworm cocoons is good this year. According to production estimates from various regions, the output of spring silkworm cocoons this year will increase by 27% compared to last year. In Hubei Province, the unit yield per silkworm egg card has more than doubled compared to last year due to the promotion of improved silkworm varieties in most areas, and farmers' incomes will also increase accordingly.

    This year's national plan for the procurement of spring silkworm cocoons has increased by 23% compared to last year. Because farmers in various producing areas are selling collectively, the entire procurement work is proceeding smoothly and rapidly. It is expected that the entire procurement of spring silkworm cocoons can be completed by the end of June.
