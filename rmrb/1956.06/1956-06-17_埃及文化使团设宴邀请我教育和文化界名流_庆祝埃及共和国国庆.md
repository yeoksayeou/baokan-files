Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: The celebrated figures of Chinese education and culture, together with the Egyptian Cultural Mission, tonight celebrated the third anniversary of the founding of the Arab Republic of Egypt in Beijing. At the celebratory banquet, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, said to the Egyptian friends: Independent and free China welcomes independent and free Egypt as our best friend.

This small celebratory banquet, filled with an atmosphere of warmth and friendship, was held on the quiet and beautiful campus of Peking University in the western suburbs of Beijing. Professor Shawarbi, the host, said to the more than fifty Chinese and foreign guests that China and Egypt, two countries with glorious histories and great futures, have established diplomatic relations, which will further strengthen the friendship between the two countries and will be beneficial to the cause of world peace.

The guests, who came from the city center in the rain, gathered with the hosts in the Linhu Xuan pavilion by the Weiming Lake. Da Puson Ahong, with a silver beard fluttering on his chest, and Nifon Saba, Archbishop of the Lebanese Orthodox Church, Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, Huang Hua, Director of the Department of West European and African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chen Zhongjing, Acting Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Liaison, Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, sat around the table with the host Professor Shawarbi. At the neighboring tables were leaders and professors from Peking University, as well as language experts and teachers from India, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Japan, and other countries. The laughter and applause in the room often drowned out the pattering of rain outside the window.

Professor Shawarbi said in his speech before the banquet that this year's National Day celebration in Egypt is linked to many significant events. The last British soldier withdrew from Egypt three days ago, and Egypt has become a completely independent country. Egypt will implement the new constitution passed this year and elect a president. Professor Shawarbi spoke excitedly about the fact that the Arab Republic of Egypt is pursuing an independent foreign policy and consolidating Egypt's friendship with Asian and African countries in accordance with the resolutions of the Bandung Conference. He said that the Egyptian people were overjoyed to welcome the Egyptian government's decision to recognize the People's Republic of China, because China is a symbol of freedom and a symbol of defending peace. Professor Shawarbi invited the guests to join him in a toast to the friendship between China and Egypt, and to the glorious future of these two great nations.

Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui then warmly congratulated the National Day of the Arab Republic of Egypt. He said: Egypt's independence is a great victory for the world's anti-colonialist movement, a victory for the just cause of all mankind, and a victory for the cause of peace. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Egypt will enable further development of friendly cooperation between the two countries in the economic and cultural fields. Qian Junrui concluded by raising his glass to Professor Shawarbi, to Mr. Far, the Egyptian commercial representative, and to other Egyptian friends, wishing the Egyptian people happiness and the unbreakable friendship between China and Egypt.

Professor Shawarbi also personally handed the list of thirty boxes of Arabic books donated by the Egyptian Ministry of Education to Peking University and the Chinese Islamic Theological Institute to Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui at the meeting. Qian Junrui shook hands with Professor Shawarbi cordially to express his gratitude, and said to him: "This is a manifestation of the deepest friendship of the Egyptian people towards the Chinese people."

After the banquet, an Egyptian news documentary was screened.
