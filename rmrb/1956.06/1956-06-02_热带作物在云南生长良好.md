    Tropical crops are growing well in Yunnan Province. The Sarava pineapples planted in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture have already fruited and will ripen in July. Citronella grass, a spice crop, is currently being propagated by root division in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture. The sisal hemp introduced last year in the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture has generally produced eleven to fourteen new leaves; the recently introduced sisal hemp has also been mostly planted. It is estimated that 200 to 300 kilograms of small-bean coffee can be harvested this year in areas such as Hekou and the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture.

    热带作物在云南生长良好
    云南省种植的热带作物生长良好。西双版纳傣族自治州的萨拉瓦种菠萝已经结果，七月间即可成熟。香料作物香茅草现正在西双版纳傣族自治州分根繁殖。德宏傣族景颇族自治州去年引种的剑麻现已普遍抽出十一到十四片新叶；最近引种的剑麻也已大部分进行定植。今年河口、德宏傣族景颇族自治州等地的小粒咖啡估计可收二百到三百公斤。
