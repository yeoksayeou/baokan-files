    I fully agree with the State Council's proposed state budget report and the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and I suggest that the Congress approve them.
    First, I would like to talk about some of my personal feelings about the state budget report.
    The annual state budget report is related to the overall national economy and people's livelihood and is a major event in our country's democratic life. This report uses specific figures to illustrate the state's financial revenue and expenditure and the overall situation and direction of the state's economic construction. It faithfully reflects what we have done in the past year, what we are doing now, and what we will do in the future. We see this year's state budget as a proactive budget, but it is based on a reliable foundation. In the next six months, in the process of implementing this budget, our tasks will remain arduous. However, we believe that with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the efforts of all the people (taking the implementation of the state budget in 1955 as an example), it will be possible to achieve this year's budget. The many proportional figures in the budget report show a dynamic picture of our country's past, present, and future.
    From this report, many proportional figures vividly show a dynamic picture of our country's past, present, and future, and also powerfully demonstrate the superiority of our country's political and economic systems. This can be explained from the following figures:
    First, last year, tax revenue accounted for the first place in the total state revenue, accounting for 46.85% of the total revenue; the income of state-owned enterprises and institutions accounted for 41.15% of the total revenue. This year, the income of state-owned enterprises and institutions increased by 26.48% compared to last year's final accounts, accounting for 48.19% of the total revenue, while tax revenue, although still increasing by 9.84%, fell to second place in the total revenue due to the surge in income of state-owned enterprises, accounting for 47.02%, a decrease in proportion compared to last year. From the changing situation of the above two types of income, it is powerfully proved that the income of state-owned enterprises will increasingly become the main source of our country's economic accumulation, while tax revenue will gradually lose its original important role. This is a major change in our country's financial revenue and expenditure and a milestone in our country's economic undertaking towards socialism.
    Second, because our country has absorbed the experiences and lessons of the Soviet Union in economic construction and implemented the policy of the general line of the state's transition period, we have been able to appropriately arrange the relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, and other aspects in the development of the national economy, which fully meets the needs of the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. This can be clearly seen from this year's state budget expenditure. For example, this year's industrial expenditure accounts for 58.59% of the total economic construction expenditure, of which heavy industry accounts for 88.59% of the total industrial expenditure, and the expenditure for light industry construction accounts for 11.41%, approximately seven to one (last year it was eight to one), with actual growth of more than 80% compared to last year. Expenditure for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy construction accounts for 13.61% of the total economic construction expenditure, and agricultural loans of 2 billion yuan will also be issued this year. Other economic construction projects have also been appropriately taken care of. There is a reason why we have not been short of living materials and daily necessities in recent years.
    Third, in this year's state budget expenditure, economic construction expenditure accounts for 52.22% of the budget expenditure, an increase of 17.04% compared to last year, national defense expenditure accounts for 19.98% of the budget expenditure, a decrease of 5.52% compared to last year, while expenditure for cultural and educational undertakings accounts for 12.74% of the budget expenditure, an increase of 18.36% compared to last year. The above figures powerfully show that while our country's national economy is developing in an all-round way, it also shows the desire of our people for peaceful construction. The reduction in the national defense budget not only shows the desire of our people for peace, but also proves the existing strength of our national defense forces. In order to actively prepare for the liberation of Taiwan, we will continue to work tirelessly on what we should do.
    This year's cultural and educational expenditure, if the part of the funding for rural primary schools that has been changed to be raised by local governments is included in the calculation, the actual growth rate of this year's social and cultural expenditure is 26.39%. This meets the needs of the cultural construction upsurge that follows the socialist economic construction upsurge.
    Secondly, I want to talk about the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives proposed by the government, which I believe is completely in line with the current development of rural areas. At present, the more prominent problem in rural areas is the emergence of another tendency besides conservatism - the tendency of recklessness. There are many examples that can illustrate this. I believe that the primary task in the current rural work is to consolidate the agricultural producers' cooperatives that have already been developed. The key issue lies in making the political and economic demands of the broad masses of peasants consistent. Preventing crudeness and half-bakedness, and earnestly doing a good job in consolidation, is in line with the basic requirements of the model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives to be approved by the Congress.
    I have already mentioned the issue of the cultural construction upsurge following the economic construction upsurge. Coincidentally, my inspection in Shaanxi Province this time was related to cultural work, and what I saw was extremely urgent. Recently, in order to promote the prosperous development of literature, art, and science, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has emphasized the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." In fact, I have already seen the great achievements of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" in literature and art in recent years; today I see the dawn of "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" in science. Therefore, I sincerely support this policy, and I would like to put the problems and personal opinions I have discovered during my inspection here as another part of this speech. The situation of cultural heritage in Shaanxi Province
    Now, I will only talk about the situation of cultural heritage in Shaanxi Province.
    Shaanxi Province is historically the cradle of our motherland's culture; Yan'an in northern Shaanxi is the sacred place of our modern national liberation and people's revolution. This region contains a profound cultural heritage, including underground historical relics and folk arts that are still preserved, which are rich and colorful; the potential power of classical literature and science cannot be ignored. Here I will only cite a few figures to illustrate:
        (1) Since liberation, our archaeological excavation work has obtained more than 30,000 unearthed cultural relics, all of which have historical and artistic value, and many of them are rare and important cultural relics that have never been discovered before;
        (2) According to the investigation, there are three local opera genres popular throughout the province, and nearly ten local opera genres popular in various regions, with thousands of practitioners;
        (3) There are as many as 80 types of folk dance forms in the province;
        (4) Folk songs, ditties, and mountain songs are all over the province
    (In the southern Shaanxi area alone, more than 1,500 folk songs and mountain songs have been collected), many of which are artistic creations full of life;
        (5) There are all kinds of ancient music performances, and only a very few performances have been lost;
        (6) According to statistics, there are more than 1,000 old folk art craftsmen scattered in rural areas throughout the province, who are good at painting, depicting, lacquer painting, meticulous painting, sculpture, clay sculpture, stone carving, wood carving, paper-cutting, etc., with an art age of at least ten years and at most forty or fifty years;
        (7) There are about 90 members of the Museum of Literature and History (Shaanxi Province, Xi'an City) with higher classical literary and artistic achievements, and many of them are experts in their fields;
        (8) There are still a considerable number of talents in agencies, schools, groups, and scattered in all aspects of society. Undoubtedly, this is a precious cultural wealth. Only when the people become the masters of the country is it possible to cherish it and inherit it and carry it forward. At the same time, it is also necessary to discover the cultural heritage and all potential forces to help us create national forms of socialist realism literature and art, and to promote socialist culture.
    In the specific practice of some work, I would like to mention the following issues: Insufficient attention to historical relics
    First, our country is an ancient and young country. It has the immortal cultural heritage created by our ancestors through hard work and wisdom, and at the same time, our generation is carrying out extremely glorious and great undertakings under the banner of socialism that our predecessors have never done before. The more new undertakings develop, the more we cherish the brilliant historical relics left to us by our ancestors. Even a fragment of tile is enough for us to draw lessons from in the process of creating a new culture. In recent years, our archaeological excavation work has developed with the development of basic construction, but the leaders of some basic construction units do not pay enough attention to historical relics, and some simply do not pay attention to them at all. There are even such units that discover cultural relics during excavation but still do not contact the cultural authorities, allowing them to be destroyed. Here is just one example (last year, 5,000 tombs were excavated, and 3,000 were destroyed). This is a violation of the state's cultural relics policy and a violation of the government's laws on the protection of cultural relics. But I haven't heard of the relevant parties investigating responsibility or giving these people the punishment they deserve. I think this is a problem. We hate the reactionary government, imperialism, and illegal merchants who have long squandered, plundered, stolen, and sold our historical relics. After these squandering, plundering, and stealing have disappeared, we must not let future generations complain that we have not done enough to protect historical relics in the construction of the great socialist cause.
    The advanced socialist country - the Soviet Union and the East European People's Democratic Republics - attach great importance to their historical relics. As far as I know, the Soviet Union has a certain proportion of archaeological funds in the construction costs. Construction areas cannot start construction without surveying by the cultural department, and the financial department does not allocate funds without the consent of the cultural department. It is also said that the Soviet Union has selected tens of thousands of historical relic areas as key protection areas. All of these are worth learning from. Raise the script and art skills to the proper artistic level
    Second, the second project in my inspection is folk art, which covers a wide range and has many problems. It is impossible to list them all. Now I will only put forward my humble opinion on one of the problems of classical drama and local opera, which may be one of the problems in the entire art field, that is, the lack of due artistry. Dramatic literature is one of the important weapons in the "eighteen martial arts" of art. Like its sister arts, "ideological" comes first, that is, the political standard is the first. But it must embody ideology through its artistry to meet political requirements. This time, I watched various local operas in Shaanxi Province and various dramas performed in Xi'an, and I also found many representative scripts to read and participated in a symposium with old artists in the drama circle, and at the same time, I had individual conversations with them. After exchanging opinions in many ways, I came to the following conclusion: All the repertoires that have been preserved have a high degree of artistry in their scripts. Here I am reminded of an idiom, "Words that are not literary will not go far." We can understand it in this way: literature should be the art of embodying ideology; far includes the distance of time and the distance of space. The opposite is true in many plays. Some do not pay attention to the artistic structure of the plot; some are not good at shaping the image of the characters in the play; some do not pay attention to the art of language - processing the lines (recitation); some do not practice hard - experience life and learn from successful old artists... Without these, it is difficult to imagine how to embody ideology and how to serve politics! This problem is small to the extent that it is related to the success or failure of a certain script's performance, and large to the extent that it is related to the survival of a certain repertoire or even a certain drama. However, the leading department does not care about it (the "Xi'an Drama" magazine compiled by the Xi'an Federation of Literary and Art Circles rarely talks about this issue), and young artists are unwilling to learn (old artists have sighed like this), and these things cannot be done by laymen. I have suggested to the local cultural authorities: organize forces to establish a unified force to sort out scripts and research art skills, and raise the scripts and art skills to the proper artistic level, so as to promote the prosperity and development of classical opera.
    I know that this problem has been noticed by the cultural department and there are ways to solve it. I am just re-mentioning it here as an aid to the overall arrangement of the cultural department. Discover and promote the potential power of heritage
    Third, in the aspect of sorting out and researching classical literature and science, there are still "heritage and abandoned talents" whose potential forces urgently need to be discovered and utilized. Since liberation, a large number of museum members of literature and history research in various places have been discovered and recruited by the government, and many of them are experts in their fields who have spent their entire lives studying. Among the members of the Shaanxi Provincial Museum of Literature and History, there is Cao Yingsheng, who is good at the "Western Xia script" that is about to be lost. There is also Zhang Xiaoheng, who has spent decades specializing in the study of linguistics. His "Explanation of Chinese Language" finds the evolution of words from the root of the word, which is helpful for the study of ancient Chinese and the current reform of characters. His "Explanation" work, which attempts to solve the obstacle of the Chinese language, has written a part, and has been helped by the Xi'an Academy of Sciences Office, but he requested two young assistants and wrote a report for two months, waiting for the approval of the Academy of Sciences.
    The cultural heritage scattered among the people, especially in private collections, is also rich. This time I went to the home of a Chinese medicine doctor in Xi'an and found that he collected many books and painting versions, many of which were valuable. The most precious is Pu Songling's own manuscript of words (up to 100 poems), which is his own manuscript. I read it through and knew that this work has the same effect as the world-renowned "Strange Tales from a Lonely Studio". I introduced it, please the relevant parties pay attention to it, or find it out and reprint it.
    The discovery and development of the potential power of heritage should be multi-faceted, and people and things should be equally valued, and it should be carried out meticulously and without fear of trouble. Suggestions to the cultural authorities
    From the above three points, there is not no problem in our cultural cause in terms of treating cultural heritage, but even though it is only "a glimpse of the leopard", in order to respond to the great call of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" put forward by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, we have reason to make suggestions to the cultural authorities:
    1. According to the actual needs (like a place like Shaanxi Province), the organization and staffing of local cultural departments should be expanded in a focused manner, the leadership should be strengthened, and the quality and level of cadres should be enriched, so that they can meet the inherent characteristics of the place and the requirements of the development of the new situation.
    2. According to the actual needs, increase funding, especially the funding used for the excavation and development of cultural heritage (the actual funding required is not very large). This year's state budget has seen a significant increase in cultural and educational funding. At the same time, the central government has appropriately increased the growth rate of local budgets in the state budget, and is also preparing to appropriately expand the local government's authority and flexibility in financial management, so that the local government can arrange its own revenue and expenditure according to the actual situation of the local area. If Shaanxi Province considers its own needs, I think the cultural expenditure item should be considered.
    Last year, the budget number for local social and cultural expenditures passed by the National People's Congress was 2,683,531,000 yuan, but the final accounts used 88.22%, and more than 300 million yuan was not used. Is there nothing to do? Or is there money that is not used? I hereby raise a question.
    3. In provinces like Shaanxi Province, there are many people with accomplishments in classical literature, art, and science. The cultural department should attach importance to these people academically, and at the same time, help them politically. If special talents are discovered, they should be recommended to the central government immediately so that they can play a greater role.
    The development of the motherland makes people a hundred times excited. We should strengthen the positive factors that are beneficial to socialist construction and turn the negative factors into positive factors.
    Finally, let us shout and strive to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and to promote the prosperity of the motherland's literature and art!
    Strive to realize the 1956 state budget!

专栏：

    陈铭枢代表的发言
    我完全同意国务院提出的国家预算报告和高级农业生产合作社示范章程，并建议大会批准。
    首先，我就个人对国家预算报告所获得的一些感受来谈谈。
    每年一次的国家决算报告，关系到整个国计民生，是我们国家里民主生活中的一件大事。这个报告用具体数字来说明国家财政收支情况和国家经济建设的总情况和方针，它忠实反映了我们在过去一年中做了些什么，现在正在做什么，将来要怎样做。我们看本年度的国家预算，是一个积极的预算，但它是有可靠基础的。在今后半年，执行这个预算过程中，我们的任务仍然是艰巨的。但我们相信有中国共产党的领导和全体人民的努力（以1955年实现国家预算情况为例），一定是可以实现本年度预算的。预算报告中许多比例数字展示了我国过去、现在和将来的动的图画
    从这个报告中，许多比例数字，鲜明地展示了我们国家过去、现在和将来的动的图画，也有力地显示了我们国家的政治制度和经济制度的优越性。从以下数字可以说明：
    第一，去年国家决算总收入中，各项税收收入占第一位，为总收入的46.85％；国营企业和事业收入占总收入41.15％。今年，国营企业和事业收入比去年决算数增长了26.48％，占总收入48.19％，而各项税收收入，虽然仍增长了9.84％，但由于国营企业收入的激增，在总收入内，下降为第二位，占47.02％，比去年的比例是下降了。从以上两项收入的消长形势来看，有力证明了，国营企业收入将日益成为我国经济积累的主要源泉，而税收收入则将日益消失其原有的重要作用。这是我国财政收支上一个重大变化，是我国经济事业向社会主义迈进的里程碑。
    第二，由于我国吸取了苏联在经济建设中的经验和教训，贯彻了国家过渡时期总路线的政策，使我们在发展国民经济中能够适当安排工业同农业、重工业同轻工业以及其他方面之间的关系，完全符合于国民经济有计划按比例发展的需要。从今年国家预算支出中，很明显地看得出这点，如今年工业支出占经济建设费总数58.59％，其中重工业占工业支出总数88.59％，用于轻工业建设的占11.41％，约等于七比一（去年为八比一），比去年实际增长均在80％以上，用于农、林、水利建设等方面的占经济建设费总数13.61％，本年还将发放农贷20亿元。其他各项经济建设，也都适当地照顾到。几年来，我们的生活资料和日用必需品，不虞匮乏，不是没有原因的。
    第三，在今年国家预算支出中，经济建设费占预算支出52.22％，比去年增长17.04％，国防费支出占预算支出19.98％，比去年减少5.52％，而文教事业的支出占预算支出12.74％，比去年增长18.36％。以上数字，有力表明了我国在国民经济全面发展的同时，还表明了我国人民和平建设的愿望。在减少国防费预算中，不仅表明了我国人民对和平的愿望，同时还证明了我国国防力量已有的强大。为积极准备解放台湾，我们仍将不松懈地致力于我们应做的工作。
    今年文教事业费，如果把乡村小学经费改由地方自筹解决的部分加入计算，则今年的社会文教支出，实际增长比例为26.39％。这是符合于继社会主义经济建设高潮而来的文化建设高潮的需要的。
    其次，我要谈的是关于政府提出来的高级农业生产合作社示范章程，我认为是完全符合于农村当前发展情况的。在目前农村中比较突出的问题，是保守主义倾向以外的另一种倾向——冒进主义倾向的出现，有许多事例，可以说明。我认为在目前农村工作中，首要之务，就是要巩固已经发展起来的农业生产合作社。关键问题，在于使广大农民的政治要求和经济要求的一致。防止粗糙、夹生，认真作好巩固工作，这才符合于即将由大会批准的高级农业生产合作社示范章程的基本要求。
    上面已经提到继经济建设高潮而来的文化建设高潮问题，恰巧我这次在陕西省视察，是文化方面的工作，而所看到的情景，是异常迫切的。最近由于中国共产党中央为了促进文学艺术和科学繁荣的发展，曾着重提出了“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”的政策。事实上，几年来我已看到文艺上的“百花齐放”的巨大成就；在今天我又看到科学上“百家争鸣”的旭日光辉。因此我对这政策，竭诚拥护，并愿在这里把我在视察中所发现的问题和个人意见，作为这个发言的另一部分。陕西省有关文化遗产方面的情况
    现在，我仅就陕西省有关文化遗产方面情况来说。
    陕西省在历史上是我们祖国文化的摇篮；陕北延安是我们近代民族解放、人民革命的圣地。这一地区蕴藏着深厚的文化遗产，包括有地下的历史文物以及至今仍被保留着的民间艺术，是丰富多彩的；古典文学、科学的潜在力量是不可忽视的。这里我只举出几个数字来说明：
      （一）解放后，我们所进行的考古发掘工作，在获得出土文物3万件以上，都具有历史价值和艺术价值，其中还有许多东西，是以往从没有发现过的、稀有的重要文物；
      （二）根据调查，有全省流行的地方剧种三种，流行于各个地区的地方剧种近十种，从业人员数以千计；
      （三）全省民间舞蹈形式有80种之多；
      （四）民歌、小曲、山歌，遍于全省
  （仅陕南一带就搜集了民歌、山歌1，500首之多），其中许多是富有生活气息的艺术创作；
      （五）古乐演奏，应有尽有，只有极少数演奏失传；
      （六）散布在农村的美术工艺老艺人，据统计全省共有1，000人以上，他们长于绘画、描画、漆画、工笔画、雕塑、泥塑、石刻、木刻和剪纸等等，其艺龄少者十几年，多者四、五十年；
      （七）具有较高古典文学艺术的文史研究馆员（陕西省、西安市）共约有90人，其中不乏学有专长的人物；
      （八）在机关、学校、团体和散布在社会各方面的人材，仍不算少数。无疑的，这是一份珍贵的文化财富。只有人民作了国家主人的时候，才有可能珍视它，并把它继承下来，加以发扬。同时，也有必要把文化遗产和一切潜在力量发掘出来，来帮助我们创造民族形式的、社会主义现实主义的文学艺术，来繁荣社会主义的文化。
    我在一些工作的具体实践中，特举出如下几个问题：对历史文物重视不够
    第一，我国是一个古老而又年轻的国家，它有我们祖先披榛斩棘、劳动智慧创造来的不朽的文化遗产，同时也有我们这一代在社会主义旗帜下，进行我们前人没有做过的极其光荣而又伟大的事业。新的事业愈发展，愈使我们珍视先人给予我们留下的光辉灿烂的历史文物，纵使片瓦寸金，也足供我们在创造新文化过程中的借鉴。几年来，我们的考古发掘工作，已随着基本建设的发展而发展，但某些基建单位的领导，对于历史文物重视不够，有的根本不重视。甚至还有这样的单位，在掘土进行中，发现了文物，仍不与文化主管部门联系，听任破坏。这里只举这一例证（去年发掘了5，000个墓葬，有3，000个是被破坏了的）。这是违反国家文物政策、违反政府保护文物法令的犯法行为。但还没听到有关方面追究责任，或给予这些人应得的处分。我认为这是一个问题。我们痛恨反动政府、帝国主义、不法商人过去长期地糟塌、掠夺、盗卖我们的历史文物，在这些糟塌掠夺和盗卖一去不复返以后，我们不要让后世子孙埋怨我们在建设伟大的社会主义事业中对历史文物保护不力。
    先进的社会主义国家——苏联和东欧人民民主国家，对于自己的历史文物是异常重视的，据我了解，苏联在建设费内，有一定比例的考古费，基本建设施工地区，未经文化部门勘测，不得开工，未经文化部门同意，财政部门不拨款，又听说苏联曾选择了数以万计的历史文物地区，作为保护重点。所有这些，都是值得我们学习的。把剧本和艺技提高到应有的艺术水平
    第二，在我视察中的第二个项目，是民间艺术，包括范围甚广，发现问题也较多，无从例举。现在只就古典戏剧地方剧方面的问题之一，也许是整个艺术领域问题之一，提出管见，那就是缺乏应有的艺术性的问题。戏剧文学是艺术“十八般武艺”中重要武器之一，它和其他姊妹艺术一样，“思想性”当先，即政治标准第一。但必须通过它的艺术性来体现思想性，以符合政治要求。这次我在西安曾看了陕西省各种地方剧，以及在西安演出的各种剧种，也曾找它们具有代表性的剧本多种来看，并参加戏剧界老艺人座谈会，同时与他们进行个别交谈。经多方交换意见，得出了这样的结论：凡是保留下来的剧目，它的剧本都有较高度的艺术性。在这里我联想到一句成语是，“言之不文，行之不远”，我们可以这样理解：文，应当是体现思想性的艺术；远，包括了时间的远和空间的远。在许多戏里恰巧相反。有的不讲究剧情的艺术结构；有的不善于塑造剧中人物形象；有的不重视语言艺术——对台词（唱白）加工；有的不苦练做工——体验生活和向有成就的老艺人学习……缺少这些，很难想像如何去体现出思想性，如何为政治服务！这问题小而至于关系到某一个剧本上演得失，大而至于关系到某一剧目乃至某一剧种的存废。可是领导部门不管它（在西安文联所编的“西安戏剧”刊物中，就很少谈到这个问题），青年艺人不肯学（老艺人有过这样的叹喟），而这些事又非外行人所能代庖。我曾向地方文化主管部门建议：组织力量，成立一个统一力量整理剧本、研究艺技的机构，把剧本和艺技提高到应有的艺术水平，从而促进古典戏的繁荣和发展。
    这问题我知道文化部门中已注意并有解决之道。在这里只是重提一下，作为文化部门全局安排中之一助。发现和发扬遗产的潜在力量
    第三，在古典文学、科学整理、研究方面，目前还有“遗产和遗才”，这些潜在力量亟待发现和发挥。解放后，被政府所发现延揽的各地文史研究馆馆员，为数甚多，其中不乏皓首穷经，学有专长的人物，陕西省文史馆员中就有长于行将失传的“西夏文”的曹颖生馆员。又有积数十年精力专事研究语言学的张筱衡馆员，他写著的“华夏语训释”从语根来找出字的演变，对于研究古汉语和当前的文字改革是有帮助的。他这“训释”工作企图解决对中国语言障碍的著作已经写好了一部分，并且已得到西安科学院办事处的帮助，但他要求青年助手二人，写了报告两个月，期待着科学院的批准。
    散布在民间的，特别是私家藏书里文化遗产也是丰富的。我这次在西安曾到一个中医生家里，发现他收藏着书、画版本甚多，其中有许多有价值的东西，最珍贵的是蒲松龄本人的词稿（达一百首），是他自己的手稿，我曾阅览一遍，知这一作品与世相传的“聊斋志异”有异曲同工之妙。我介绍出来，请有关方面重视，或找出来影印。
    发现和发扬遗产的潜在力量，应是多方面的，人和物都要同样重视，而且要细致地、不怕麻烦地来进行。向文化主管部门的建议
    从以上三点来看，在我们的文化事业上，关于对待文化遗产方面，并不是没有问题，然仅虽是“一斑”未窥“全豹”，但为了响应中国共产党中央所提出的“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”的伟大号召，我们有理由向文化主管部门提出建议：
    一、应该根据实际需要（像陕西省这样地方）有重点地扩大地方文化部门机构的编制，加强领导力量，充实干部质量水平，使能符合于地方固有的特点和新形势发展的要求。
    二、根据实际需要，增加经费，特别是使用于发掘与发扬文化遗产方面的经费（实际上所需经费并不很大）。今年国家预算，文教经费已有显著增长，同时中央在国家预算中，已经适当地增大地方预算的增长率，同时还准备适当地扩大地方在财政管理上的权限机动性，使地方能根据当地实际情况，安排自己的收支。陕西省地方如果根据自己的需要，我想文化经费一项，是应当考虑到的。
    去年地方社会文教费，经全国人民代表大会通过的预算数，为2，683，531，000元，但决算数用去88.22％，尚有3亿多元没有用，这究竟是没事可做呢？还是有钱不用？我特此提出疑问。
    三、像陕西省这样的省份，对古典文学艺术界科学有修养的人材不少，文化部门应当在学术上重视这些人，同时，在政治上帮助他们，如发现特殊人材应即向中央推荐，使能发挥更大作用。
    祖国的发展，使人百倍兴奋，我们应该把有益于社会主义建设的积极因素加强，并把消极因素变为积极因素。
    最后，让我们高呼为贯彻“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”的政策、为祖国文学艺术的繁荣而奋斗！
    为实现1956年的国家预算而奋斗！
