    Starting Early on Editing Local Chronicles
    ——Speech by Representative Wang Zhuchen
    After listening to and discussing the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, I fully agree.
    I would like to offer my opinions on the collection and compilation of local chronicle materials by each province or autonomous region and directly administered municipality:
    I. China's area and population are equivalent to the whole of Europe. China's provinces or autonomous regions and directly administered municipalities are equivalent to large and small countries within Europe. The large and small countries of Europe each have their splendid literature, and thus Europe has become a civilized region. Similarly, if China is to have complete literature, it will rely on the provinces, regions, and municipalities to supply accurate information.
    II. China is a large country, with ten thousand li from north to south and east to west. Climate, products, terrain, and soil, human habits, all have their specific circumstances within the national unity. There should be preparations to adapt to the environment and overcome difficulties according to local conditions. Special local investigations and research have the same importance as "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" for the whole country.
    III. In the vast middle and primary schools, teaching the history of our country and Chinese geography, citing and utilizing local teaching materials, is of great significance in terms of both knowledge and education. Because according to the principles of "from near to far" and "from known to unknown," teaching can increase a high degree of intuitiveness and specificity, thereby making it easier to develop students' enthusiasm for learning and also helping to develop students' patriotism. Kalinin said: "Patriotic education begins with a deep understanding of one's hometown." Therefore, many teachers in the Soviet Union pay great attention to teaching students local knowledge.
    Since the Song and Yuan Dynasties, counties have had county chronicles, and provinces have had general chronicles, the importance of which is second only to the national history. We should promote this cultural heritage. However, editing local chronicles cannot be accomplished overnight. Moreover, today we have the core strength of the Chinese Communist Party leading us, and Marxism-Leninism guiding our thinking. The editing of local chronicles can no longer follow the old ways. How to "eliminate the crude and retain the refined, eliminate the false and retain the true" must be done cautiously from the historical materialist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. To this end, the first step is to possess rich materials, that is, to collect local chronicle materials and compile them into a collection, as a preparation for editing local chronicles. For example, the historical investigation of Song Jingshi and Wu Xun was published, and only then did the people of the whole country pay attention and clarify his history. If we wanted to clarify Song Jingshi's history before publishing it, wouldn't it never be published?
    For another example, the Draft History of the Qing Dynasty has been completed, but the Kuomintang government believed that some of its contents were inappropriate, so it stopped its publication. The Kuomintang government has never modified its content well, and the Draft History of the Qing Dynasty has never been published. What a great loss this is! If the Kuomintang government annotated and explained what it considered inappropriate in the Draft History of the Qing Dynasty, and still ordered it to be published, making it public to the whole country for people to criticize, wouldn't it be better?
    I put forward this opinion at the first meeting of this conference. The Ministry of Internal Affairs replied that it was editing geographical chronicles. At that time, my opinion focused on compiling county chronicles first. This year, the new fifth issue of Jin Yufu's proposal to comprehensively revise the new local chronicles also intends to focus on county and city chronicles. After two years of research, I feel that the biographies of people in the old county chronicles occupy a very large amount of space, mostly praising the merits of landlords and bureaucrats, which should be deleted urgently, and the remaining data can be incorporated into the provincial general chronicle. Moreover, there are too many counties in the country, and it is not easy to revise them comprehensively. There are fewer talents in each county, making it difficult to take care of this. For the present plan, it is better to start with the provinces or autonomous regions and directly administered municipalities with conditions, grasp the key points, and it is easier. There are different schools of local chronicles that focus on history or geography. In today's editing of local geography is extremely necessary, but the central government has more materials, which should be edited by the central government. Historical materials are scattered in various places. If they are not collected in time, I am afraid that the elderly will die, and the anecdotes will be lost, and it will be too late to remedy them in the future. Therefore, local chronicles should first pay attention to the historical part. I ask for your guidance on whether my opinion is appropriate!

### 早早动手编辑地方志——王祝晨代表的发言

    早早动手编辑地方志
    ——王祝晨代表的发言
    听取和讨论了李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长的报告，我完全同意。
    今拟就各省或自治区和直辖市着手搜集并编辑地方志资料汇编，提出我的意见：
    一、中国的面积和人口数，相当于整个欧洲，中国的各省或自治区和直辖市相当于欧洲境内大小国家。欧洲的大小国家各自有其灿烂的文献，因之，欧洲就成为文明区域。同样，中国若原有完整的文献，亦有赖于各省、区、市供给正确的资料。
    二、中国是个大国，南北东西都有一万里，气候、物产、地势、土壤、人体习惯，在全国统一之中，各自有其具体情况。关于适应环境，克服困难，应有因地制宜的准备。各个地方的特殊调查研究，对全国范围来说和“百花齐放”“百家争鸣”有同样的重要意义。
    三、在广大的中、小学校里，讲授本国历史和中国地理援引和利用当地的乡土教材，无论在知识方面或教育方面都具有重要意义。因为根据“由近及远”“从已知到未知”的原则，使教学可以增加高度的直观性与具体性，从而易于发展学生学习上的积极性，也帮助发展学生的爱国主义精神。加里宁说过：“关于爱国主义教育是从深入认识自己故乡开始的”，因此，在苏联许多教师都非常注意教给学生乡土知识问题。
    中国自宋元以来，县有县志，省有通志，其重要仅次于国史。这种文化遗产，我们正应发挥光大。但编辑地方志不能一蹴而就。况在今天有领导我们的核心力量中国共产党，有指导我们思想的马克思列宁主义。对于地方志的编辑不能再一仍旧贯。怎样“去粗取精，去伪存真”，必须以历史唯物主义的立场、观点、方法批判地谨慎的使用。为此，第一步必须占有丰富的材料，即搜集地方志资料编为汇编，是作为编辑地方志的准备。例如宋景诗一经武训历史调查记把他发表出来，全国人们集中注意才把他的历史弄清楚。若想把宋景诗历史弄清楚然后发表，岂不终于发表不出来了吗？
    再如清史稿，已经修好，国民党政府认为它的内容有些不合适处，就停止它出版。国民党政府一直没有把它的内容修改好，清史稿一直没能出版，这个损失多么大？如果国民党政府把它认为清史稿不合适处，注释说明，仍令出版，公之全国，任人批判，岂不更好么？
    我的这个意见，在本会第一次会议时就提出来，经内务部函复该部正在编辑地理志。当时我的意见着重于先编县志，今年新建设第五期金毓黻普修新地方志的拟议，亦拟以县市志为主。经我两年来的研究，觉得旧县志人物一志所占篇幅极大，多为地主、官僚颂扬功德，亟宜删去，所剩资料可纳入全省通志中。况全国县份太多，普修不易，各县人才较少，很难兼顾及此。为今之计，莫如从省或自治区和直辖市有条件的先行试办，提纲挈领，较为容易。地方志有注重历史或地理的不同派别。在今日编辑地方地理极为需要，但中央掌握材料较多，应由中央编辑。历史资料散在各地，若不及时搜集，恐老人雕谢，掌故随之失传，将来补救为时已晚，故地方志应先注意历史部分。我的这个意见，是否有当，请求指教！
