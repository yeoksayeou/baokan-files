Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 14th: The World Women Workers' Conference, initiated by the World Federation of Trade Unions, opened in Budapest on June 14th. The conference is attended by 450 women worker representatives from 35 countries, as well as many guests.

The General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Louis Saillant, also attended the conference.

After electing the chairperson and various working committees, the conference unanimously adopted the following agenda:

1.  On the common struggle of women workers and trade unions to raise wages, truly realize the principle of "equal pay for equal work," oppose all forms of discrimination, strive to improve living conditions, fight for rights, and secure peace.

2.  On the active participation of women workers in trade union life and leadership, and striving to get women workers to join trade unions.

At the morning session, Gille, the secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, gave a long report on the first item on the agenda.

Gille said that the initiative proposed by the Seventh Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council has brought together women of all nationalities and countries, representing hundreds of millions of sisters. In the process of preparing for this conference in many capitalist countries, the struggle to meet women's demands has greatly developed. Women have also begun to join trade union organizations in large numbers.

Gille continued, we must not only expose the serious discrimination suffered by women, but also work together to eliminate this discrimination. Eliminating wage discrimination is the basis for striving to meet women's demands in other aspects of social and political life.

Gille then spoke about the unsatisfactory situation in capitalist countries, dependent countries, and colonial countries regarding working hours, protection of mothers, living conditions, and political and social rights. She said that if we compare the situation of women in these countries with the situation of women in socialist countries, we can clearly reveal the essence of the capitalist system. Capitalists seek to maximize profits, which not only impoverishes working-class families, but also may lead to war. And the process of preparing for war and war itself will further worsen people's lives.

Gille said that women hate war because war takes away their children. Therefore, they are engaged in a courageous struggle to shatter the conspiracies of launching war, and often stand at the forefront of this struggle.

Gille continued, the preparatory work for our conference has been of great help in developing and strengthening the unity of the working class on a national and world scale. We must continue to move forward along this path. In the future, we cannot regard some of the problems we face as issues that should be discussed endlessly, but as problems that can and must be solved.

Finally, Gille issued a call for cooperation with all trade union organizations—the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions—and asked them to support the demands of the workers themselves and strive to meet these demands. She said, we believe that if our proposals can be supported, then this World Women Workers' Conference will be a truly important stage in the struggle to achieve the economic and social liberation of women workers, strengthen their unity of action, meet their just demands, and fight for peace.

### 世界女工会议在布达佩斯开幕

    世界女工会议在布达佩斯开幕
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯十四日讯：世界工会联合会倡议召开的世界女工会议，六月十四日在布达佩斯开幕。参加会议的有三十五个国家的四百五十位女工代表，此外还有许多来宾。
    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬也参加了会议。
    会议在选出主席和各工作委员会以后，一致通过了下列议程：
    1、关于女工和工会共同为争取提高工资、真正实现“同工同酬”的原则、反对一切形式的歧视、争取改善生活条件、争取权利和和平而进行的斗争的问题。
    2、关于女工积极参加工会生活和工会的领导工作，争取女工加入工会的问题。
    在上午会议上，法国总工会书记纪耶就第一项议程作了长篇报告。
    纪耶说，世界工联理事会第七届会议提出的倡议，使得代表几亿姊妹的一切民族和国家的妇女聚集在这里。在许多资本主义国家筹备这次会议的过程中，满足妇女要求的斗争有了很大的发展。妇女们也开始大批地加入工会组织。
    纪耶接着说，我们现在不仅要揭露妇女受到的严重歧视，而且应该同心协力来消除这种歧视的现象。消除工资方面的歧视现象，是争取满足妇女在社会和政治生活的其他方面的要求的基础。
    纪耶随后谈到资本主义国家、附属国和殖民地国家在工作日的时间、母亲的保护、居住条件、政治和社会权利方面的不能令人满意的情况。她说，如果把这些国家的妇女的境遇和社会主义国家妇女的境遇比较一下，就可以清楚地揭示出资本主义制度的本质。资本家力图牟取最大限度的利润，不仅使得工人家庭陷于贫困，而且还可能引起战争。而准备战争的过程和战争本身，又要使人民的生活更加恶化。
    纪耶说，妇女是憎恨战争的，因为战争要夺去她们的孩子。因此，她们为粉碎发动战争的阴谋而进行着勇敢的斗争，而且常常走在这个斗争的最前列。
    纪耶接着说，我们这次会议的筹备工作对于发展和加强国家范围内的以及世界规模的工人阶级的团结一致，是一个巨大的帮助。我们要继续沿着这条路前进。将来我们不能够把我们面临的一些问题看作是应该无终止讨论的问题，而应该看作是可以而且必须解决的问题。
    纪耶最后向所有工会组织、世界工会联合会、国际自由工会联合会、基督教工会国际联合会发出合作的呼吁，并且要求它们支持工人本身的要求，争取满足这些要求。她说，我们认为，假如我们的建议能够得到支持，那末这次世界女工会议对于争取女工的经济和社会解放、加强她们的行动的团结一致、满足她们的正义要求和争取和平的斗争，将是一个真正重要的阶段。
