I fully agree with the reports and explanations made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I propose that the congress approve and adopt the 1955 National Final Accounts, the 1956 National Budget, and the Model Charter for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives.

I am a scientific and technical worker in the iron and steel industry. This time, I participated in the national twelve-year science development plan, and I feel extremely excited and honored, and I have received great inspiration and education. I would like to express my personal opinions on the issue of how the science and technology of the iron and steel industry can catch up with the world's advanced technological levels:

1.  Regarding the adoption of new technologies, the iron and steel industry has achieved great success in recent years as a result of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. This year, some technical and economic indicators, such as blast furnaces, are close to the Soviet level of 1955. The newly built iron and steel enterprises have adopted the latest Soviet technology and equipment, which will create favorable conditions for production technology to reach the world's advanced level. The problem is that the old factories that have not undergone technical transformation have simple and outdated equipment, small factory buildings, and poor transportation and labor conditions. In recent years, the government has invested a considerable amount in old factories, but most of it has been used to expand the capacity of individual production equipment. There is insufficient investment in systematic transformation, and there is also a lack of systematic planning. Therefore, the equipment of the old factories is still very backward, and the production conditions are very poor. The quality of products and the adoption of new technologies are greatly restricted. Some steel plants still use coal as heating fuel, which makes it difficult to heat steel ingots and steel unevenly, and it is more difficult to control the temperature than with electric heating or gas. There is a lack of metering and production process control instruments, and the degree of mechanization is very poor, not to mention automation of operations. Some steel plants do not have scales to weigh the weight of molten steel. Workers climb onto the steel ladles and use steel bars to detect the height of the molten steel surface. The lack of large oxygen generators and vacuum pumps is an impediment to the adoption of new technologies such as oxygen steelmaking and vacuum casting. The layout of the factory buildings and the labor conditions are very poor, indicating that the old factories now need to be technically transformed and equipment added to create conditions for the adoption of new technologies.

2.  In terms of expanding product varieties, the iron and steel industry has also made great achievements in recent years. Many steel grades and types have been added, such as silicon steel sheets and alloy seamless steel pipes. However, the current variety is still far from meeting the requirements of industrial development. There are still problems of incomplete planning and preparation work and lack of close coordination in the work of expanding varieties. The investigation and research before the trial production and the summary of experience after the trial production are not done enough, so that sometimes detours are taken and waste is caused. Some do not fully consider the equipment conditions for putting into production after the trial production. The small-scale trial production is successful, but the formal production lacks conditions. Some small-scale trial production is successful, but the operating technology cannot be mastered when transferred to regular production, and the pass rate is low. There is also a situation that, due to incomplete planning, the trial production is successful, but the user department does not need it.

3.  In terms of product quality, the iron and steel industry has gradually adopted Soviet standard specifications for production in recent years, striving for the quality of products to meet the requirements of Soviet standards. However, due to insufficient attention to product quality by some enterprise leaders and production personnel; weak technical leadership and management; and insufficient production operation experience; scientific research work cannot keep up, so that the quality of some products currently does not meet Soviet standards, some are of uneven quality and low pass rate; even some unqualified products are missed and shipped out of the factory, and qualified products are judged as waste products, causing huge losses. On the other hand, due to the lack of experience in the production and use departments, there is still a lack of unified grading standards for the appraisal of steel quality, and the technical conditions for ordering are not specific, so that disputes occur during delivery and use, which are delayed and unresolved, delaying production.

4.  Improving the technical level of employees is also one of the main conditions for catching up with the world's scientific and technological level. In recent years, thanks to the attention of the Party, the government, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to this work, meetings have been convened and a twelve-year long-term plan for national employee spare-time education has been formulated. The education and industrial sectors have actively promoted this work. Several night universities in the iron and steel industry have been opened successively, and various spare-time learning systems have been gradually established. However, because the enthusiasm of the workers is high, the production tasks are heavy, the meeting time is too long, the learning time is easily squeezed out, and some cadres and workers who leave their posts to study in schools are also affected by attending too many meetings. Some of them need more and longer study time because their original technical level is too low, but because they are eager to learn, they work too hard and affect their health. These are the existing problems.

In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, I would like to put forward the following suggestions based on my personal opinions, and I would like to ask all representatives for criticism and correction:

1.  Strengthen the technical leadership of industrial production at all levels. The establishment of the State Technology Commission is to create good conditions for this work. It is recommended that departments, bureaus, research institutions, and enterprises quickly establish technical or academic committees, absorb outstanding engineering technology and scientific research personnel at all levels to participate, determine the technical policies of each institution and enterprise; review work plans and check the completion of work, so as to adopt new technologies, expand varieties, and improve product quality with leadership and planning; and guide and solve technical problems in a timely manner. In this way, the collective leadership can organize all positive factors to overcome our shortcomings of low technical level and lack of production experience.

2.  The rapid formulation of a technical transformation plan for old factories and the gradual implementation in a planned and step-by-step manner is an urgent task to be carried out at present. During the period of national industrial recovery and the first five-year plan, old enterprises have undertaken the glorious task of supplying materials, accumulating funds, and training skilled workers and cadres for national industrial construction, but due to the backwardness of old equipment, it must be transformed in a planned manner to meet the requirements of the further development of industry. For factories and mines that have not been rebuilt or expanded, it is recommended that the industrial sector combine the national construction long-term plan and the production equipment capacity of this major to plan the production direction and development scope of each old factory. The starting time for reconstruction should be early, the progress should be fast, the scope should not be too wide, and the focus should be on the equipment conditions and product characteristics of each enterprise to carry out reasonable division of labor and specialization. Because the number of newly built factories in the country is increasing day by day, and the industry needs a lot of types of products, these are all creating favorable conditions for the division of labor and specialization of enterprises. Considering the content of adding equipment and technical transformation on the basis of the division of labor and specialization, this creates good conditions for the adoption of new technologies. If the scale of reconstruction and expansion is too large, it will result in a long reconstruction time and it will not be easy to get a comprehensive and reasonable arrangement. It is not suitable for the production in the process of reconstruction and the future technical development.

3.  Strengthen the scientific research work of industrial departments and enterprises. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the government have attached great importance to scientific research work, but due to the many production technical problems that enterprises urgently need to solve during the recovery period, and the technical strength is very weak. Therefore, too little scientific research work has been carried out in the iron and steel industry in recent years, and the current situation is far from meeting the requirements of production development. Since the Party and the government called for a major advance in science, various departments have transferred forces to strengthen scientific research work and leadership. This is a correct and timely measure. To carry out this work, it is recommended to start from the actual needs of production, study and solve the quality problems existing in the department or enterprise. The second is to summarize the advanced experience of the enterprise or department, learn the new technologies of the Soviet Union and other countries, and combine the specific situation to do a good job in preparing for the promotion of new technologies and improving technical and economic indicators and creating conditions through experimental research. Finally, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out the trial production of new products in laboratories and intermediate factories in the expansion of varieties, so as to accumulate experience and provide technical data for the production of new products on an industrial scale. Research institutions in the industrial sector should also quickly organize all forces to strive to complete the tasks specified in the twelve-year scientific development plan.

4.  It is recommended to ensure the spare-time technical study time for employees, implement the resolutions and regulations of the National Employee Spare-Time Education Conference; pay attention to the progress and health of labor models and skilled workers who leave their posts to study, and reduce their time to participate in meetings; and also pay special attention to the business study and training plans of foremen and team leaders, and arrange their study time. Various departments and enterprises should strengthen the leadership of employee spare-time education, and solve the difficulties and problems in the implementation of the spare-time technical education system and plan in a timely manner.

Finally, I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the active labor of the national workers and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the science and technology of China's iron and steel industry will surely catch up with the world's advanced level in the shortest time. Through Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the issue of intellectuals and the government's call for a major advance in science, the scientific and technical personnel of the iron and steel industry will further exert their enthusiasm, transform their thinking, improve their working methods, and closely unite around the Party and the government, and contribute all their strength to complete the extremely glorious task of catching up with the world's advanced scientific and technological level.

    提高钢铁工业技术水平
    ——丘玉池代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长、彭真副委员长的报告和说明，并建议大会将1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算、高级农业生产合作社示范章程予以批准和通过。
    我是一个钢铁工业科学技术工作者，这次参加了全国十二年科学发展规划工作，感到无比的兴奋和光荣，得到很大的启发和教育。我仅就有关钢铁工业科学技术在赶上世界先进技术水平中的问题发表个人的几点意见：
    1．在采用新技术方面，数年来钢铁工业在这方面由于学习苏联先进经验的结果，取得了很大的成绩。今年有些技术经济指标如高炉已接近苏联1955年的水平。新建的钢铁企业都是采用了苏联的最新技术装备，这将为生产技术达到世界先进水平创造有利条件。问题在于还没有经过技术改造的旧厂，设备简陋陈旧，厂房狭小，运输和劳动条件差。几年来政府对旧厂已花了相当数量的投资，但大部分用于扩大个别生产设备的能力。对于系统改造，投资分配不足，也缺少系统的规划。因此，旧厂的设备仍然很落后，生产条件很差。产品的质量和新技术的采用受了很大的限制。有的钢铁厂仍以煤为加热燃料，以致钢锭钢材加热不匀，温度比用电热或煤气难于控制，影响产品质量。计量和生产过程控制的仪表都很缺少，机械化的程度很差，更谈不到操作的自动化。有的钢厂没有称钢液重量的磅秤，凭工人爬上盛钢桶用钢条来探测钢液面的高低。在采用氧气炼钢、真空浇注等新技术则缺乏大型的氧气机和真空泵。厂房的布置和劳动条件很差，说明现在旧厂需要进行技术改造，增添设备为采用新技术创造条件。
    2．在扩大产品品种方面，几年来钢铁工业也取得了很大的成绩。增加了很多钢种和型类，如矽钢片、合金无缝钢管等。但目前的品种仍然远远不能满足工业发展的要求，在扩大品种工作中还存着计划和准备工作不周密，协助联系不密切等问 题，试制前的调查研究和试制后的总结经验工作都做得不够，以致有时走了弯路，造成浪费；有的没有充分考虑到试制后投入生产的设备条件，小量试制是成功的，但正式生产则缺乏条件；有的是小量试制是成功了，转入经常生产则操作技术不能掌握，合格率低；还有一种情况，由于计划不周密，试制成功了，但使用部门不需要。
    3．在产品质量方面，几年来钢铁工业已逐渐采用苏联标准规格进行生产，争取产品的质量能达到苏联标准的要求。但是由于有些企业领导和生产人员对产品质量重视不够；技术领导和管理薄弱，生产操作经验不够；科学研究工作跟不上，以致目前有些产品质量达不到苏联标准，有的是质量不均匀、合格率低；甚至有些不合格品漏检出厂，合格品则被判为废品，造成巨大损失。另一方面由于生产和使用部门缺乏经验，对钢材质量的鉴定还缺乏统一的评级标准，订货技术条件不具体，以致在交货及使用时发生争执，拖延不决，耽误生产。
    4．提高职工技术水平也是赶上世界科学技术水平主要条件之一。几年来由于党、政府和总工会重视这一工作，召开了会议，拟定了全国职工业余教育的十二年远景规划，教育和产业部门积极推动这一工作，钢铁工业方面的夜大学已先后开办几所，并逐渐建立了各种业余学习制度。但是由于职工劳动热情高，生产任务繁重，会议时间过多，学习时间易被挤掉，有些部门脱产入学校学习的干部和工人也因参加会议多而影响学习的进度；有的因为原来技术水平过低，需要更多更长的学习时间，但是因为学习心切，用功过度影响身体健康。这都是存在的问题。
    为了解决上面所说几个问题，仅就个人意见提出下列几项建议，当否请各位代表批评指正：
    1．加强各级对工业生产的技术领导。国家技术委员会的成立，为了给这一工作创造良好条件，建议部、局、研究机构和各企业迅速成立技术或学术委员会，吸收各级优秀的工程技术和科学研究人员参加，确定各机构和企业的技术方针；审查工作计划和检查工作完成情况，达到有领导有计划的采用新技术、扩大品种、提高产品质量；及时指导和解决技术上的问题。这样发挥了集体领导力量就能组织一切积极因素以克服我们技术水平低，生产经验少的缺点。
    2．迅速制定旧厂技术改造方案，有计划有步骤，逐步实现，是目前迫切需要进行的工作。在国家工业恢复和第一个五年计划时期，旧有企业为国家工业建设负起了供应材料、积累资金、培养技术工人和干部的光荣任务，但由于旧有设备落后，必须有计划的加以改造，才能满足现在工业进一步发展的要求。对未经改建和扩建的厂矿，建议工业部门结合国家建设长远计划、本专业的生产设备能力，对每一旧厂的生产方向和发展范围进行规划。改建开始的时间要早，进度要快，范围不要太广，还要着重各企业设备情况，产品特点，进行合理分工专业。因为国家新建的工厂日增，工业上需要产品的种类很多，这都是为企业分工专业创造了有利条件。在分工专业的基础上来考虑增添设备和技术改造的内容，这就为了采用新技术创造了良好条件。改建和扩建的规模若太大，将造成改建时间长，不易得到全面合理的安排。对改建过程中的生产和今后技术上的发展都是不适宜的。
    3．加强产业部门和企业的科学研究工作。建国以来党和政府，对科学的研究工作非常重视，但是由于恢复时期，企业急待解决的生产技术问题很多，技术力量又很薄弱。因之几年来在钢铁工业方面进行的科学研究工作太少，目前是远不适应生产发展的要求。自从党和政府号召向科学大进军以来，各部门已抽调力量加强科学研究工作和领导。这是一个正确而适时的措施。展开这一工作，建议首先从生产实际需要出发，研究和解决本部门或企业存在的质量问题。其次是总结本企业或部门的先进经验，学习苏联和其他国家的新技术，结合具体情况通过试验研究为推广新技术提高技术经济指标做好准备工作和创造条件。最后还必须在扩大品种中，大力进行试验室和中间工厂的新产品试制工作，为在工业规模上生产新产品积累经验、提供技术资料。产业部门的研究机构还应该迅速组织一切力量为完成十二年科学发展规划所指定的任务而奋斗。
    4．建议保证职工业余技术学习时间，贯彻全国职工业余教育会议的决议和规定；注意劳动模范和技术工人脱产学习的进度和健康，减少其参加会议时间；还要特别注意工长和班长的业务学习和培养计划，安排其学习时间。各部门和企业要加强对职工业余教育的领导，及时解决执行业余技术教育制度和计划中的困难和问题。
    最后我深信在党和毛主席的英明领导下，全国职工的积极劳动和苏联专家的热情帮助下，我国钢铁工业的科学技术一定能够在最短的时间内赶上世界的先进水平。钢铁工业的科学技术人员通过周恩来总理关于知识分子问题的报告和政府提出向科学大进军的号召，将进一步发挥自己的积极性，改造自己的思想、改善工作方法，紧密团结在党和政府的周围，为完成赶上世界先进科学技术水平这一极其光荣的任务而贡献出自己一切的力量。
