    Chongqing Textile Factory Actively Improves Cotton Yarn Quality
    (Our report) The factories in the Chongqing textile system are actively taking measures to improve the quality of cotton yarn. In the past, the fine yarn workshop of the 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory only paid attention to adjusting the count deviation, and did not strictly control the drawing process. The count unevenness rate was generally around 3.2. Now they are actively controlling the drawing process, so that the count unevenness rate has dropped to an average of around 2.7. Yuxin Yarn Factory, the factory with the worst quality in the Chongqing textile system, has also made great improvements in the quality of cotton yarn recently. The long-term problem of the carding machine producing "radish silk" in the carding workshop has been basically eliminated due to the improved method of pre-treating raw cotton and the specifications of the blades of the mixing cylinder.
    In the process of improving the quality of cotton yarn, the factories have paid attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experience. Recently, from the 517 small experiences created by the workers, forty advanced experiences that have a major effect on improving quality have been summarized. After the new doffing method of Chen Shulan's team of Shashi Yarn Factory was promoted in the 610 Factory, the number of end breaks per machine was reduced from 5.3 to 2.9. The Southwest Textile Administration Bureau also specially dispatched a group of engineering and technical personnel to form a quality inspection team to go deep into various factories to summarize and promote advanced experience.

    重庆纺织厂积极提高棉纱质量
    本报讯　重庆市纺织系统各厂积极采取措施提高棉纱质量。610纺织染厂细纱车间过去只注意调整支数偏差，对并条没有严格控制，支数不匀率一般在3.2上下。现在他们积极控制好并条，使支数不匀率平均下降到2.7上下。重庆市纺织系统各厂中质量最差的渝新纱厂最近棉纱质量也有很大改进。这个厂清花车间长期以来没有解决的清花机产生萝卜丝现象严重的问题，由于改进了预处理原棉的方法和合花缸的刀片规格，现在已经基本消灭了产生萝卜丝的现象。
    各厂在提高棉纱质量的过程中，注意了总结和推广先进经验的工作。最近各厂从工人创造的517项点滴经验中，总结出了四十项对提高质量有重大作用的先进经验。沙市纱厂陈树兰小组新的落纱工作法在610厂推广以后，使每台车的断头由5.3根降低到2.9根。西南纺织管理局还专门抽调了一批工程技术人员组成质量检查组，深入各厂总结和推广先进经验。
