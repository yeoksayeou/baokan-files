Grain work has greatly improved.

In the nearly one year since the last conference, grain work has greatly improved. The 1955 grain production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a timely and correct instruction to reduce the procurement quotas. As a result of the implementation of the unified purchase and sale plan in rural areas, each agricultural resident could retain an average of approximately 40 more catties of raw grain than in the previous year. In specific work, all regions, in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" promulgated by the State Council, implemented the "three fix" policy of fixing production, purchase, and sales to households, and announced that the fixed production and purchase figures would remain unchanged for three years, and the fixed sales figures would be assessed annually. In places where this method was correctly implemented, the farmers were satisfied.

However, this was a task facing over 100 million individual farmers, and it was also a complex task with insufficient experience. It is hard to imagine that there would be no shortcomings. It is estimated that the "three fix" work was not fully completed in approximately 15% of the townships nationwide at that time. In addition, some places retained too little grain for feed; many places had not reserved feed for the planned increase in pig production. Some places experienced small-scale disasters after the "three fix" was completed, and no reductions or exemptions were implemented during the unified purchase. In areas where overseas Chinese relatives were concentrated, such as Guangdong and Fujian provinces, sufficient care was not given according to the instructions of the State Council, taking into account the special circumstances of overseas Chinese relatives. But more commonly, the increase in farmers' labor in the high tide of agricultural production required more food, livestock needed more feed, and the expansion of cultivated areas and the promotion of close planting increased the demand for seeds. Therefore, some areas that were not short of grain originally became short of grain, and those that were short became even shorter. Some places did not provide timely and appropriate solutions for this new situation. Since March, all regions have conducted inspections and rectifications of the unified sales work in rural areas in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and these shortcomings have been largely corrected. According to statistics, the unified sales volume in rural areas in May exceeded the same month last year by more than 600 million catties; it is expected to exceed even more in June. These figures show that the grain situation in rural areas is generally not tight at present. The problem is that some staff members in some places still have a "the tighter, the better" bias. They are unwilling to issue grain purchase certificates for increased unified sales to farmers, and these places still have some tight situations.

Starting from September last year, cities and towns across the country successively implemented quantitative supply in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Quantitative Supply of Grain in Cities and Towns" promulgated by the State Council. The results of the implementation are basically good: the waste of grain has been eliminated, and the trend of grain flowing back to rural areas has been stopped. From July 1955 to May of this year, the sales volume of grain in cities and towns decreased by 5.6 billion catties compared with the same period of the previous year. The standard of quantitative supply in cities and towns is generally in line with needs.

The standard of quantitative supply in cities and towns is generally in line with needs; however, when it comes to each city, town, and individual, there are cases of surplus or shortage. The main reason for the surplus or shortage is the amount of non-staple food consumed by residents. In cities and towns across the country, the quantitative supply is generally sufficient or surplus in places where non-staple foods are relatively abundant; in places where non-staple foods are scarce, some rations at different levels are considered insufficient. In the same city or town, residents with the same ration level and generally high living standards find the ration sufficient or surplus because they can eat more non-staple foods; a few residents with low living standards find the ration insufficient because they eat less non-staple foods. Secondly, within the same ration level, the labor intensity of each person is different, which also affects the surplus or shortage of the ration. In addition, there are complex factors such as inappropriate grade classification, different food management systems, different living habits, and different climates. It cannot be ignored that psychological tension can also make people feel that they are not eating enough.

In order to solve these problems, all regions have also conducted inspections and rectifications of the supply in cities and towns since March this year, and have provided subsidies to some employees of government agencies, large and medium-sized students, children, and housewives; residents who feel that the ration is insufficient can also apply for subsidies. After this series of heavy and complex work, we believe that we can ensure that all city and town residents have enough to eat under the principle of thrift. The national grain situation is very stable. We can withstand any natural disasters.

So far, the national grain situation is very stable. The state's grain procurement target has been overfulfilled; the grain sales target has a surplus. The amount of grain on the market in most national grain markets has increased compared with the same period last year; this can also prove that the grain situation in rural areas is generally easing.

Here, it is necessary to explain a fact: the total grain output of the country in 1955 was 368 billion catties of raw grain, and the national population was estimated to be 603.23 million (in the mainland), with an average possession of 610 catties per person. This average of 610 catties of raw grain per person, in addition to ensuring that people have enough to eat, must also ensure that livestock are fed well, pigs are fattened, and seeds are sufficient. In addition, it is also necessary to supply raw materials for oil extraction, yarn sizing, winemaking, vinegar, sauce, soy sauce, and the manufacture of monosodium glutamate, vermicelli, bean curd sheets, bean curd, soy milk, bean sprouts, paste, and other industries, handicrafts, and sideline industries. It can be seen that this is not very affluent. Of course, the average possession per person in previous years was even less. Relying on the unparalleled superiority of our national system and social system, relying on the correct leadership of the Party and the state, relying on the arduous work of party and government personnel at all levels and the efforts of all grain workers, and achieving bit-by-bit conservation and rational distribution, we have been able to overcome three major disasters in the past seven years, export 3-4 billion catties of grain every year, and accumulate some national reserves and increase some inventory grain. This is indeed an arduous and complex struggle. Therefore, the "the tighter, the better" thinking of some of our staff members is understandable, but it must be corrected. After criticizing the "the tighter, the better" bias, we must also prevent another "the looser, the better" bias. The correct approach is to rely on the masses, conduct in-depth research, explain the truth clearly, and solve problems realistically according to the system and plan.

The basic completion of agricultural cooperation has brought about a fundamental change in the grain situation—of course, it is far from a fundamental solution to the grain problem. Representatives who have inspected agricultural cooperatives will tell us: the ideal of "man will conquer nature" has been realized in our time; we can overcome any natural disasters, and we can increase production year after year in the future. Yes, according to the experience of grain work in the past seven years, from a national perspective, we can overcome any natural disasters. We were able to provide relief for the disasters caused by the 1949 floods without preparation and with insufficient storage, transportation, and other conditions. Today, we can say with full confidence: we can provide relief for any disasters. We were able to withstand the unprecedented floods of 1954, and today we can say with full confidence: we can withstand any natural disasters. As everyone knows, the total grain output of the country in 1954 increased slightly. This year, the floods in the Jianghuai River basin were harmful during the summer harvest season, but the national wheat output is still estimated to increase. Indeed, the collective strength of over 500 million farmers, under the correct leadership of the Party and the state, and using our country's extremely superior "if the east is not bright, the west is bright" natural and geographical conditions, we can not be afraid of any natural disasters. Of course, this does not mean that we can "sit back and relax." Not at all. Maintaining sufficient vigilance against possible misfortunes in the road of active advancement with full confidence: this is precisely the guiding ideology for the Communist Party to lead us to continuous victories. We should not be paralyzed at any time.

Do a good job of grain work through cooperatives.

After the basic completion of agricultural cooperation, the rural grain unified purchase and sales work has been reduced from facing over 100 million individual farmers to facing 1.01 million cooperatives, which will greatly improve the quality of our work. We hope that cooperatives will fully promote democracy and do a good job in unified calculation of grain while doing a good job in internal distribution. All our grain workers should use the same amount of energy as last year to help cooperatives do a good job in unified calculation; we must recognize that this is the most basic step in doing a good job in grain work. We should believe that it is more beneficial to the country, the cooperative, and the members to go through the collective rather than through individuals; but we should never mechanically require everything to be solved through the collective. Those problems that cannot be completely solved through the collective at present, such as grain unified sales, can allow individual purchases in addition to collective purchases. We also hope that the leaders of cooperatives will provide opinions to the grain departments at any time to help us do a good job.

By correctly grasping the surplus and shortage of grain through cooperatives, the planning of receipt into the warehouse can be greatly strengthened, so that reasonable allocation of grain can be achieved, reasonable transportation at the grassroots level can be implemented, and a large amount of expenses can be saved for the country. In 1955, Hubei, Guangxi, Henan, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Anhui and other provinces made achievements in this work. Among them, Hubei Province saved 61% of the expenses compared with 1954; Yanggu County in Shandong Province reduced the transportation volume by 94.14% compared with 1954. The conditions this year are more favorable than last year, and those who have already made achievements can achieve greater achievements, and those who have not made achievements can certainly achieve achievements as long as they work hard.

The basic completion of agricultural cooperation will also play a role in ensuring that the quality of grain entering the warehouse meets the standards. Grain depot personnel should explain to the members through the cooperative the benefits of drying and cleaning the grain entering the warehouse for the country and the harm of bad grain entering the warehouse for the country and the consumer masses; at the same time, in accordance with the policy of paying higher prices for good grain and lower prices for inferior grain, they should explain to the members that it is also beneficial to themselves to sell good grain. The quality inspection personnel of the grain depot should go to the cooperative to carry out inspection work, and if they find grain that does not meet the standards, they should require it to be sorted, turned, and dried, and then transported into the warehouse after reaching the standards. It must be noted that because farmers are now busy, mobilizing migrant workers to sort, turn, and dry the grain after it enters the warehouse will not only cause losses to the country, but also be detrimental to agricultural production.

Achievements in grain storage and management.

The storage and management work of the grain department continues to achieve remarkable results. From what was seen in this inspection of Shanghai and Zhejiang, insect-free warehouses, mold-free warehouses, and four-no warehouses (no insects, no mold, no rats, no birds, no accidents) can be seen everywhere. The practice of the Jiaxing Special District Grain Bureau in Zhejiang Province is worthy of attention in all regions: the Provincial Grain Department instructed that rice with a moisture content of more than 16.1% must be turned and dried immediately; the Jiaxing Special District Grain Bureau understood the purpose and requirements of the superiors to manage the grain well and save expenses, grasped the law that the moisture content of late rice in previous years was safe for storage, obtained the consent of the Provincial Department, and decided that late rice with a moisture content of 16.1% to 17% could be temporarily not turned and dried as long as there were conditions for immediate handling, in order to save turning and drying expenses. I think that the Provincial Department's instructions based on general conditions are correct, and the Special District Bureau's grasp of special conditions and tapping of the potential for savings, and not mechanically implementing the instructions of the superiors, is a good example of opposing conservative thinking and bureaucracy. In the movement to develop four-no grain warehouses in various regions, there are still some tendencies to waste expenses; this is a sharp contrast to the Jiaxing Special District Bureau.

The shortage of warehouse capacity in the grain department is serious. It may be unprecedented in history to store grain in open-air enclosures in rainy areas in the south, but 42% of the grain in Shanghai is stored in the open air. Here, we must first criticize the mistakes in the guiding ideology of our ministry in warehouse construction in recent years.

It should be affirmed that since the establishment of the Ministry of Food, the appropriate reduction of warehouse construction standards has achieved results in saving capital construction expenses. In 1953, it was again instructed to build simple warehouses with a cost of about 20 yuan per square meter in various regions, and the direction was also correct. The problem is that the standard warehouse does not meet the improved standards, and the simple warehouse does not meet the requirements for popularization. The standard warehouse is a bungalow, which is not suitable for cities that must cherish land, nor is it suitable for developing towards mechanization; the cost of simple warehouses is still too high to be used to replace enclosures.

We now preliminarily believe that cities must gradually build silos that develop towards the sky and can increase the storage capacity per unit area by 8-10 times; otherwise, the base problem will be difficult to solve. Silos are an improved standard. A popular standard can consider the type of wooden frame, tile roof, earthen wall or bamboo fence wall suggested by the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Department; according to the calculation of the Jinhua Special District Grain Bureau, each 10,000 catties of warehouse capacity only costs 24 yuan, less than 10 yuan per square meter, less than 4% of the value of grain storage (raw grain), not more expensive than enclosures, but can be used for more than ten years. We believe that this kind of simple warehouse is good enough; it can certainly be promoted in places where wood is not too scarce to replace expensive and unsafe enclosures and straw warehouses. Those who are good at using local materials and good at promoting the excellent traditions of local construction engineering may have already created more economical and safer warehouse types, and we should continue to investigate and study.

Unify the leadership of grain processing.

In the past six months, grain departments in various regions have successively unified the leadership of grain processing plants, making it possible for us to grasp the overall processing situation. We have learned that the grain processing in recent years has been successful. In terms of finished product rate, in 1955, the national rice yield rate was 72.12% for rice to white rice (more than 92% for brown rice to white rice), 93.11% for brown rice to white rice, and 85.39% for wheat flour yield. This means that we have successfully implemented the "Decision on Changing Grain Processing Standards and Increasing Edible Grain" promulgated by the Executive Yuan before 1950 and overfulfilled the task. It is estimated that the result of improving the finished product rate can increase the output of finished grain by about 2 billion catties per year. At present, the quality of standard rice and standard flour has generally been greatly improved compared with the 92 rice and 81 flour in 1950. However, the achievements are uneven, and the tendency to unilaterally pursue the finished product rate regardless of quality exists in many places. From the letters from the people received by the Ministry, we learned that the masses have no objection to eating coarser rice now, but they still have many opinions on the impurities in flour and miscellaneous grain rice. For rice, on the contrary, there are opinions that it is too refined and white. The situation seen in the recent inspection is exactly like this. The degree of refinement and whiteness of rice in Shanghai is obviously higher. The price of superior white rice in Zhejiang is only about 3% higher than that of standard rice, but the standard rice is still the best-selling. This fact shows that in our country, anything with a scientific basis, as long as we persist to the end, firmly believe in the decisions of the Party and the government, fully mobilize the collective wisdom of the workers, and fully utilize science and technology, and unremittingly carry out publicity and education to the broad masses, we will eventually be able to win. Those who used to think that 92 rice and 81 flour could not be promoted should now find that their thinking is too conservative.

We once required grain processing to "improve the finished product rate under the premise of ensuring quality," but this is only an abstract call. It is difficult to implement correctly if you rely solely on abstract calls, and it is also difficult for superiors to conduct inspections and supervision through statistics. To this end, we have issued inspection standards for processed grain, requiring gradual achievement of the standards without affecting the finished product rate achievements that have already been obtained nationwide. Some people think that this requirement is too high, too aggressive, and difficult to achieve. The situation grasped in this inspection proves that such requirements are completely achievable. In the rice mills we saw in Hangzhou City and several counties in Jiaxing, Jinhua, and Wenzhou Special Districts in Zhejiang Province, many of the equipment was very poor, and generally relied on manual winnowing and sifting to remove impurities, but the rice yield rate of rice to white rice exceeded 73%, and the quality met the standards with few impurities. The rice in Zhejiang is mainly indica rice, which has a low rice yield rate. Zhejiang can achieve a rice yield rate of more than 73% for rice to white rice, can we still say that it is too aggressive for us to require the country to maintain a rice yield rate of 72.12%?

Enable the people to eat clean, fresh, and nutritious grain.

The primary task in grain supply work in the future is to enable the people to eat clean, fresh, and nutritious grain, so that rice can be cooked without rinsing. Therefore, the primary task of processing work is to remove impurities, improve purity, and preserve as many germs as possible. In order to ensure freshness, the grain transferred to the cities must be properly scheduled; moreover, the cities must also process part or even most of the grain for their own use.

We have affirmed that steamed rice is an ideal grain with a high rice yield, high cooking rate, nutritious, easy to digest, and can be stored for a long time. In the future, the state's inventory will increase year by year, and agricultural cooperatives' grain storage will also increase year by year. In addition to spending a lot of money, the work of replacing old grain with new grain will have a more serious risk of not being able to sell it. Mass production of steamed rice and mass storage of steamed rice have become an urgent need. However, the attitude of our Ministry of Food towards the trial production of steamed rice is not active. Zhejiang Province has achieved preliminary results in the trial promotion of steamed rice in Jinhua; however, the supply is still insufficient in the vast areas around Taihu Lake that are originally accustomed to eating steamed rice. The future policy is to revive the folk traditional steamed rice workshops, and at the same time, try to manufacture mechanized steamed rice in Shanghai. Steamed rice is another thing with a scientific basis; in our country, it must also be promoted successfully.

The inspection also learned that the categories of winter frost rice around Taihu Lake are very complicated. The past claim that winter frost rice had a very low nutritional value may only be the result of the analysis of some crudely made winter frost rice. Now we require the Jiaxing Special District Grain Bureau to conduct a new study to determine the nutritional value of winter frost rice. This is another type of grain suitable for long-term storage.

Appropriately meet the masses' requirements for grain diversification.

Another task of grain supply work is to appropriately meet the masses' requirements for grain diversification. We have now established a grain miscellaneous products company to supply specially made rice and flour with a higher degree of refinement and whiteness, famous varieties of grain, small miscellaneous grains, and some grain replicas. Because the quantity of these commodities is limited, we can only appropriately increase some prices to limit purchases. Incidentally, the price of specially made rice in some provinces and cities is only about 3% higher than that of standard rice, which will lose its restrictive effect and is not suitable.

The problem in the business of the grain miscellaneous products company is that many small miscellaneous grains and famous varieties that people love may be squeezed out in the case of simply pursuing high-yield crops in various regions. For example, at present, the sources of mung beans, broad beans, red and white kidney beans, sesame, etc. are already feeling insufficient.

Enable the masses to have the freedom of adjustment under the planned restrictions.

Another task of grain supply work is to enable the masses to have the freedom of adjustment under the planned restrictions. In cities, this mainly relies on the cooked food industry; and in rural areas, in addition to the cooked food industry, there is also the national grain market. The supply of grain to the cooked food industry should be further relaxed in the future; and special grains will be supplied as much as possible to maintain its advantages for famous cooked foods. Regarding the national grain market, we know that some places have implemented the method of supporting the market with funds and grain and have achieved results. This may be necessary to make the grain market normal and active. We should quickly study this experience and consider promoting it.

Promote rice bran oil extraction and mixed feed processing.

The oil business was only assigned to the leadership of the grain department this year. At present, the supply of oil is stable, but the shortage of oil production is still serious. We believe that rice bran oil extraction can increase the output of more than 100,000 tons of oil every year and should be vigorously promoted. The rice bran cake after oil extraction still has a fat content of no less than wheat bran and is still a very good concentrate feed, and compared with rice bran, it also has the advantage of not rotting for a long time and being easy to transport. Of course, after oil extraction, the amount of rice bran used as feed will be reduced, but this is relatively easy to adjust from secondary grains to compensate.

The feed business is also newly added this year. The processing of mixed feed is a new topic for us. The method of grinding rice husks and mixing them with rice bran to make unified bran for piglet feed has been effectively promoted in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Sichuan and other provinces and cities. The Soviet Union and East Germany also have similar experiences. We should take it as the starting point for manufacturing mixed feed and actively promote it.

Improve the lives of employees and cultivate technical talents.

From what I have seen in previous inspections, the grassroots employees of the grain department are lovely. Although the equipment in warehouses, grain stores, and processing plants is generally very poor, many grassroots units have achieved very good results by relying on their high sense of responsibility and creative labor. The main problems that exist at present are: the hygiene conditions in many grain stores are not up to par; the labor conditions in many processing plants are also very poor; many grassroots staff members do not have days off throughout the year; the lack of welfare and education and training facilities is even more common and serious (problems such as the regularization of temporary employees, the upgrading of employees, and the reduction of actual income of a small number of employees can be resolved in the upcoming wage reform). The national grain department has more than 600,000 employees, but there is not a single university, and there are only two secondary vocational schools, let alone places for medical treatment and recuperation. The existence of these shortcomings should first examine the serious conservative thinking in the leadership of our Ministry of Food. For a considerable period of time after the establishment of the Ministry of Food, we did not even do work such as investigating and statistics on the system's personnel, and establishing important systems, and completely abandoned leadership. Even at that time, the leading comrades in many places had already blamed us for not being good at solving problems for the local areas.

The situation of not paying attention to scientific knowledge has existed for a considerable period of time in the leadership of the Ministry of Food. Emphasizing political conditions and raising political conditions to an unreasonable height has also had extremely adverse consequences for the absorption, use, and cultivation of scientific and technical talents and senior intellectuals. There are now more than 6,000 rice processing plants in the country, but there is not a single engineer. Now, processing plants require improved equipment, and warehouses require mechanization, but there is not a single factory in the country that specializes in manufacturing grain processing and warehouse machinery. The requirements of the country and the people for grain work are increasing day by day, and the times are forcing us to modernize in all aspects of our work. Then we must ask the education department to help us cultivate scientific and technical talents at a greater speed; we must also ask the machinery manufacturing department to designate specialized institutions and factories to research and trial-produce modern technical equipment.

The financial situation of the grain department has fundamentally improved.

In the past year, the financial situation of the grain department has undergone fundamental changes. Since the leadership thinking of the Ministry of Food reached a consensus last spring, affirmed the economic accounting system, criticized the supply system thinking, and jointly arranged financial profit and loss indicators to the grain departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, combined with the improvement of objective conditions, it turned from loss to profit in the second half of last year. Looking at the provinces and cities separately, the most prominent is Zhejiang Province, which lost 24.93 million yuan in 1954, turned to a profit of 6.56 million yuan last year, and the cost level decreased by 30.69% compared with 1954, only 9.58% of the sales amount. In addition, there are also some units with very poor results. This shows that the potential for savings in the grain department is very large. The vivid facts criticized the conservative thinking of the past that grain work was destined to lose money and lose money to stabilize the grain market. Now it seems that despite the many unfavorable objective factors at that time, it was still possible to lose less or even not lose money with sufficient subjective efforts. The general rule at present is that as long as the financial work is valued at the leadership level in that place, it can often be done to both stabilize the grain market and accumulate funds for the country; only a very small number of areas with special circumstances are exceptions. Starting this year, the grain department will be able to regularly turn over a small amount of profit every year.

The profit of the grain department mainly relies on bit-by-bit savings. The implementation of the regional production and sales balance and reasonable transportation system has enabled us to reduce the inter-provincial transportation volume by more than 1 million tons; coupled with the implementation of reasonable transportation at the grassroots level mentioned above, it can save more than 100 million yuan in freight throughout the year. This is the largest savings project, but it is also meticulously calculated batch by batch and pen by pen by each region and each grassroots point, and accumulated bit by bit. The most vivid example of bit-by-bit savings is the recycling and reuse of old flour bags at a given price. It seems to be the most trivial thing, but the whole country can save more than 28 million yuan for the country throughout the year, which is not a small thing.

Improve leadership work and promote democracy.

As mentioned above, everyone can see that the conservative thinking of our Ministry of Food in the past was serious. After criticizing conservative thinking, will there be another rush? This has not been checked out. Even if there is, it may only be something written on paper. The main thing encountered in practical work at present is the resurgence of conservative thinking. The fundamental condition for ensuring the correctness of leadership thinking will be the implementation of the democratic system and the in-depth research of business. As long as democracy is truly promoted, cadres and the masses will not allow us to be conservative, nor will they allow us to be aggressive; as long as business research is thorough, everyone can reason based on facts on the basis of promoting democracy, and conservatism and aggression will not be able to gain power. The business is more detailed and specific the lower it goes, and it is difficult for us to fully grasp it as superiors. Therefore, these specific business problems must be devolved to the subordinate competent authorities, responsible for its research, encouraging it to make preliminary decisions, and the superior only needs to make the final approval; many things can even directly help and encourage the subordinate to be responsible for implementation, and the superior only needs to conduct timely inspection. By doing this, we can cultivate thousands of large and small experts in our work. This is also an aspect of promoting democracy. With a democratic system, with experts, we must also reflect the policy of both opposing conservative thinking and preventing rashness and aggression through laws, decrees, regulations, systems, and plans, so that the following will not feel that today is a gust of wind and tomorrow is another gust of wind, and some are at a loss. Even if all of this is available, we must still learn the patience of many leading comrades of the Communist Party. Because, after criticizing conservatism and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, things are very numerous and very complex, and the promotion of democracy is also the same. As long as we treat it with a little impatience and simplification, it will hurt the enthusiasm and democratic spirit of the masses.

I feel very happy that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have correctly and timely put forward the instructions to mobilize all positive factors to jointly build socialism. We must all make a major determination and implement these instructions in all our work without discount with the most active attitude, to ensure that we move from the glorious victories we have already obtained to even greater victories.

The above opinions are submitted to all representatives for criticism and correction. I also request all representatives to inspect the grain work at all levels and correct our shortcomings in a timely manner.

    一年来的粮食工作
    ——粮食部长章乃器的发言
    粮食工作有了很大的改进
    上次大会以后将近一年中间的粮食工作有了很大的改进。1955年的粮食生产得到了空前的丰收，同时，中共中央适时而又正确地指示我们减少了征购指标；农村统购统销计划执行的结果，平均每一个农业人口比上年度大致可以多留40斤的原粮。在具体工作中，各地按照国务院颁布的农村粮食统购统销暂行办法，将定产、定购、定销的“三定”政策贯彻到户，并且宣告定产、定购数字三年不变，定销数字一年一评。凡是正确执行这个办法的地方，农民是满意的。
    但是，这是一件面对一亿以上个体农户的工作，而且是一件很复杂而又经验不够的工作，很难设想不会有缺点。据估计，全国大约有15％的乡，当时“三定”工作没有完全做好。此外，有些地方对饲料用粮留得偏紧；许多地方还没有对计划增产的生猪留给饲料。有些地方在“三定”后发生小片灾荒，没有在统购时实行减免。在广东、福建等省侨眷集中地区，没有根据侨眷的特殊情况，按照国务院的指示给以足够的照顾。但比较普遍的，是农业增产高潮中农民劳动量增大，需要多吃，牲口也需要多喂，耕种面积的扩大和密植的推广，籽种的需要量也增加，因此，有些原来不缺粮食的变成缺粮了，缺少的变成缺多了。对于这种新的情况，有些地方没有给以及时的妥善的解决。各地从3月份开始按照中共中央和国务院的指示，对农村统销工作进行了检查和整顿，这些缺点大体上都已经得到了纠正。据统计，农村5月份的统销量比较去年同月还超过了6亿多斤；预计6月份还要超过更多。这些数字说明了，目下农村粮食情况一般是不会紧的。存在的问题是，有些地方的工作人员仍然有“愈紧愈好”的偏向。他们不愿意将增加统销的购粮证发给农户，这些地方仍然有些紧张的情况。
    从去年9月份开始，全国市、镇陆续按照国务院颁布的市、镇粮食定量供应暂行办法实行定量供应。实行的结果基本上是好的：浪费粮食的情况消除了，粮食倒流农村的趋势制止了。从1955年7月到今年5月的11个月中，市、镇粮食销售量较之上年度同期减少了56亿斤。市、镇定量供应的标准大体上符合需要
    市、镇定量供应的标准，大体上是符合需要的；但具体到每个市、镇和每个人，则发生了有余或不足的情况。发生有余、不足的主要原因是居民对副食品消费的多或少。在全国市、镇中，凡是副食品比较充沛的，一般定量足够或有余；副食品缺乏的，有些等别的定量反映不足。在同一个市、镇中，同一定量等别的居民，一般生活水平高的由于可以多吃一些副食品，定量够用或有余；少数生活水平低的由于少吃副食品，定量会感到不足。其次，在同一定量等别中，各人的劳动强度是不相同的，这也要影响到定量的有余或不足。此外，还有划定等级不恰当、伙食管理制度不同、生活习惯不同、气候冷暖不同等等复杂的因素。不能忽视，心理上的紧张也会使人们由够吃变成不够吃。
    为着解决这些问题，各地从今年三月起对市、镇供应也进行了检查和整顿，对一部分的机关团体职工、大中学生、儿童和家庭劳动妇女，分别给以补助；其他感到定量不足的居民也可以申请补助。经过这一系列繁重复杂的工作，我们相信可以做到保证所有的市、镇居民在节约的原则之下够吃。全国粮食局势是很稳的。我们可以抗得住任何天灾
    到目前为止，全国粮食的局势是很稳的。国家的粮食征购指标已经超额完成；粮食销售指标有余。全国大部分国家粮食市场上市的粮食都比去年同期增加；这也可以证明农村粮食情况一般是和缓的。
    这里需要说明一件事实：1955年全国粮食总产量是3，680亿斤原粮，全国人口估计为60，323万人（在大陆的），每人平均占有量为610斤。这每人平均610斤的原粮，除了要保证人够吃之外，还要保证牲口喂饱，猪养肥，籽种够用，此外，还需要供应榨油、浆纱，酿造酒、醋、酱、酱油，制造味精、粉条、粉皮、豆腐、豆浆、豆芽、浆糊等等工业、手工业和副业的原料。可以看到，这并不是怎样宽裕的。当然，以前各年的每人平均占有量还要更少一些。依靠我们国家制度和社会制度的无比优越，依靠党和国家的正确领导，依靠地方各级党政人员的艰巨工作和全体粮食工作人员的努力，做到了点滴节约、合理分配，我们才能在七年当中战胜了三次相当大的灾荒，每年输出了三、四十亿斤的粮食，而且积累了一些国家储备和增长了一些库存粮食。这的确是一场艰巨、复杂的斗争。因此，我们的某些工作人员“愈紧愈好”的思想是可以理解的，当然也是必须加以纠正的。批判了“愈紧愈好”的偏向以后，也要防止又来一个“愈松愈好”的偏向。正确的做法是依靠群众，深入钻研，说清道理，实事求是地按制度、按计划解决问题。
    农业合作化的基本完成，带来了粮食局势的根本变化——当然还远不是粮食问题的根本解决。凡是视察了农业合作社的代表，都会告诉我们：“人定胜天”的理想已经在我们的时代里实现了；我们可以战胜任何的天灾，我们今后可以年年增产。是的，根据七年来粮食工作的经验，从全国范围来说，我们是可以战胜任何的天灾的。我们能够在没有准备和储粮、运输等条件十分不够的情况下救济得了1949年洪水所造成的灾荒，今天就可以满怀信心地说：我们可以救济得了任何的灾荒。我们能够抗得住1954年那样百年未有的洪水，今天就可以满怀信心地说：我们可以抗得住任何的天灾。大家知道，1954年的全国粮食总产量是有少量增加的。今年夏收时节江淮流域洪水为害，但是全国小麦估计仍然可以增产。的确，五亿多农民的集体力量，在党和国家的正确领导下，运用起来我们祖国极其优越的“东方不亮西方亮”的天时、地理条件，我们是可以不害怕任何的天灾的。当然，这并不是说我们就可以“高枕无忧”了。完全不是的。在满怀信心地积极前进的道路中，经常对可能发生的不幸事故保持足够的警惕：这正是共产党领导我们不断取得胜利的指导思想。我们在任何时候都不应该麻痹。通过合作社做好粮食工作
    农业合作化基本完成后，农村粮食统购统销工作由过去面对一亿多个体农户缩减到面对101万个社，将使我们的工作质量提高一大步。我们希望合作社充分发扬民主，在做好社内分配的同时做好粮食的统一计算工作。我们全体粮食工作人员要用同去年一样多的精力，帮助合作社做好统一计算工作；要认识到这是做好粮食工作最基本的一步。我们应该相信：通过集体较之通过个体，会对国家、对合作社、对社员都更加有利；但决不应该机械地要求事事通过集体。那些目前还不可能完全通过集体来解决的问题，如粮食统销，就可以在集体购粮之外也允许单独购粮。我们还希望合作社的领导随时向粮食部门提供意见，帮助我们做好工作。
    通过合作社正确地掌握粮食的余缺情况，接收入库的计划性就可以大大地加强，就可以做到粮食的合理摆布，贯彻基层合理运输，为国家节约大量的费用。在1955年，湖北、广西、河南、江西、黑龙江、云南、安徽等省，在这一工作上都做出了成绩。其中湖北省，比1954年节省费用达61％；山东省阳谷县，比1954年减少运输量达94.14％。今年的条件比去年更加有利了，已经取得成绩的还可以取得更大的成绩，没有取得成绩的只要努力，也一定是可以取得成绩的。
    农业合作化的基本完成对于入库粮食质量合乎标准的要求也将起着保证的作用。粮库人员应该通过合作社，向社员说明入库粮食的晒干扬净对国家的好处和坏粮入库对国家和消费群众的害处；同时按照优粮优价、次粮次价的政策，向社员说明交售好粮对于自己也有利益。粮库的验质人员应该到合作社里去进行检验工作，发现不合标准的粮食就要求加以整理、翻晒，达到标准以后再运送入库。必须注意，由于农民现在忙了，入库以后再动员民工整理、翻晒，不但国家要遭受损失，对农业生产也是不利的。粮食仓储保管工作的成绩
    粮食部门的仓储保管工作继续取得显著的成绩。从这次视察上海、浙江所见到的，无虫仓，无霉仓，无虫无霉、无鼠雀、无事故的四无仓，已经到处可以见到了。浙江嘉兴专区粮食局的做法是值得各地注意的：省粮食厅指示水份在16.1％以上的稻谷须即速进行翻晒；专区粮食局体会了上级既要保管好粮食、又要节约费用的目的和要求，掌握了历年晚稻水份对于储存安全的规律，取得了省厅的同意，决定水份16.1％至17％的晚稻，只要有随时加以处理的条件，可以暂时不翻晒，以节约翻晒费用。我认为，省厅按照一般情况作出指示是对的，而专局掌握特殊情况挖掘节约潜力，不照例机械地执行上级的指示，则是一个反对保守思想、官僚主义的良好榜样。各地在开展四无粮仓运动中，还有一些不惜浪费开支的偏向；这同嘉兴专局相比，是一个尖锐的对照。
    粮食部门仓库容量不足的情况是严重的。在南方多雨地区在露天用围囤储存粮食，可能是史无先例的，但上海就有42％的粮食存在露天。在这里，我们首先必须批判我部几年来在建仓工作中领导思想的错误。
    应该肯定，粮食部成立以后，由于适当降低建仓标准，对基本建设费用的节约是有成绩的。1953年又指示各地建造每平方米造价在20元左右的简易仓，方向也是正确的。问题在于：标准仓不合于提高的标准，简易仓又不合于普及的要求。标准仓是平房，不适宜于必须珍惜用地的城市，也不适宜于向机械化发展；简易仓造价仍然太高，不能用以代替围囤。
    我们现在初步认为：城市必须逐步建筑向天空发展的、单位面积储量可以提高8—10倍的立筒仓；否则基地问题就很难解决。立筒仓是提高的一种标准。普及的一种标准可以考虑采用浙江省粮食厅建议的木架、瓦顶、土墙或竹笆墙的式子；据金华专区粮局计算，每万斤仓容只需造价24元，每平方米不到10元，不及储粮（原粮计）价值的4％，不比围囤贵，但可以用十年以上。我们认为这种简易仓够好了；在木料不太缺的地方一定可以推广，以代替费用很高而又不安全的围囤和草仓。那些善于就地取材，善于发扬当地建筑工程的优良传统的地方，可能还已经创造了更经济、更安全的仓型，我们应该继续调查研究。统一对粮食加工工作的领导
    半年来，各地粮食部门陆续统一了对粮食加工厂的领导，使我们有可能掌握全面的加工情况。我们了解到：近年的粮食加工是有成绩的。以成品率来说，1955年全国大米出米率，稻出白是72.12％（合糙出白超过92％），糙出白是93.11％，小麦出粉率是85.39％。这就是说：我们已经胜利地执行了1950年前政务院颁布的“关于改变粮食加工标准，增加食用粮食的决定”而且超额完成了任务。估计成品率提高的结果，每年可以增产成品粮20亿斤左右。目前标准米、标准粉的质量，比较1950年的九二米，八一粉，一般已有很大的改进。但成绩是不平衡的，不顾质量片面追求成品率的偏向，在不少地方是存在的。从本部接到的人民来信了解到，目下群众对于吃糙一些已经没有意见了，对于面粉和杂粮米中的杂质，则仍然有不少的意见。对于大米，相反地，到有过于精白的意见。最近视察中所见到的情况，正是如此。上海大米的精白度显然高了一些。浙江的上白米，价格比标准米只高3％左右，但是，销路最大的，仍然是标准米。这一事实说明了，在我们的国家里，凡是有科学根据的东西，只要坚持到底，坚决相信党和政府的决定，充分动员职工群众的集体智慧，充分利用科学技术，而又不懈地向广大群众进行宣传教育，最后是一定可以胜利的。那些过去认为九二米和八一粉推广不开的人们，现在应该发现自己的思想是太保守了。
    我们曾经要求粮食加工“在保证质量的条件下提高成品率”，但这只是一个抽象的号召。单凭抽象的号召，到下面去就很难正确执行，上级也很难通过统计以进行检查和监督。为此，我们已经颁发了加工粮检验标准，要求在不影响全国已经获得的成品率成绩的条件下逐步达到标准。有人认为，这个要求太高了，冒进了，难以实现。这次在视察中所掌握的情况，证明这样的要求是完全可以实现的。在浙江省杭州市和嘉兴、金华、温州等专区的几个县里我们所见到的碾米厂，有许多设备很差，一般依靠人力过风过筛清除杂质，但出米率稻出白超过了73％，而质量够标准，杂质很少。浙江的稻谷主要的是出米率不高的秈稻。浙江能做到稻出白超过73％，我们要求全国保持72.12％的出米率，难道还能说是冒进？使人民吃到清洁、新鲜、富于营养的粮食
    今后粮食供应工作中的首要任务，是要使人民能够吃到清洁、新鲜、富于营养的粮食，做到大米可以不淘洗下锅。因此，加工工作的首要任务，是清除杂质、提高纯洁度和保存尽可能多的胚芽。为要保证新鲜，调入城市的粮食必须正确安排时间；而且，城市也必须加工一部分甚至大部分自用的粮食。
    我们已经肯定蒸谷米是出米率高、出饭率也高，富于营养、易于消化、又可以长期保管的理想的粮食。今后国家库存逐年加大，农业社储粮也将逐年加大，推陈储新的工作除了花钱很多以外，更严重是会有推不出去的危险。大量生产蒸谷米，大量储存蒸谷米，已经成为当前迫切的需要。但是，我们粮食部对于蒸谷米的试制工作的态度是不积极的。浙江省在金华试行推广蒸谷米，已经取得了初步的成绩；但太湖周围原来习惯于食用蒸谷米的广大地区，供应仍然不足。今后的方针是把民间土法蒸谷米作坊重新繁荣起来，同时在上海试制机制蒸谷米。蒸谷米又是一件有科学根据的东西；在我们的国家里，一定也是可以胜利地推广的。
    视察中还了解到太湖周围的冬霜米的品类是很复杂的。过去冬霜米营养价值很低的说法，可能只是对某些粗制滥造的冬霜米化验的结果。现在我们要求嘉兴专区粮食局重作研究，确定冬霜米的营养价值。这又是一种适宜于长期保存的粮食。适当满足群众对于粮食多样化的要求
    粮食供应工作的另一任务，是适当满足群众对于粮食多样化的要求。我们现在已经成立粮食杂品公司，供应精白度较高的特制大米和面粉、名贵品种的粮食、小杂粮和一些粮食复制品。因为这些商品的数量有限，我们只能适当地提高一些价格来限制购买。顺便指出：有些省、市的特制大米的价格，比标准米只高3％左右，那就会失去了限制的作用，是不相宜的。
  粮食杂品公司业务上的问题，是在各地单纯追求高产量作物的情况下，许多人民喜爱的小杂粮和名贵品种有可能被挤掉。例如，在目前，绿豆、蚕豆、红白小豆、芝麻等的来源就已经感到不足了。使人民群众在计划限制下能有调剂的自由
    粮食供应工作的又一任务，是使人民群众在计划的限制下能有调剂的自由。这在城市，主要依靠熟食业；而在农村，除了熟食业之外，还有国家粮食市场。对熟食业粮食的供应，今后还要再放宽一些；对于名产的熟食品，还将尽可能供应特种的粮食，以维持它的优点。关于国家粮食市场，我们知道有些地方已经实行了以资金和粮食支援市场的办法，取得了成绩。要使粮食市场正常和活跃，这可能是需要的。我们应该赶快研究这一经验，考虑加以推广。推广米糠榨油和混合饲料的加工
    油脂业务是今年才拨给粮食部门领导的。目前油脂供应的情况是稳定的，但是，油脂生产不足的情况仍然是严重的。我们认为，米糠榨油每年可以增产10万吨以上的油脂，应该大力推广。榨了油以后的米糠饼，脂肪含量仍然不下于麸皮，仍然是很好的精饲料，而且比起米糠来，还有在较长时间内不会腐烂和易于运输的优点。当然，榨油后，米糠作为饲料的数量是要减少了，但这是比较容易从次粮中调剂出来抵补的。
    饲料业务也是今年新增加的。混合饲料的加工，是我们的一个新课题。将稻壳研磨配合米糠制成统糠供应架子猪饲料的办法，在上海、浙江、广东、四川等省、市，都已经推行有效。苏联和民主德国也都有同样的经验。我们应该把它作为制造混合饲料的起点，积极地加以推广。改善职工生活，培养技术人才
    从历次视察中所见到的，粮食部门的基层职工是可爱的。尽管仓库、粮店和加工厂的设备一般都很差，但是，依靠他们的高度责任感和创造性的劳动，许多基层单位都做出了很好的成绩。目前存在的主要问题是：许多粮店的清洁卫生条件还不够水平；许多加工厂的劳动条件也很坏；许多基层工作人员通年没有休息日；福利和教育培训设施的贫乏，更是普遍而且严重（关于临时雇员转正，职工升级和少数职工实际收入减低等问题，在即将进行的工资改革中可以获得解决）。全国粮食部门有60多万的职工，但还没有一所高等学校，中等专业学校也只有两所，更谈不到医疗、休养的处所了。这些缺点的存在，首先应该检讨我们粮食部领导上严重的保守思想。在粮食部成立以后相当长的时间内，我们连对系统人事的调查统计、建立重要制度等工作都没有做，完全放弃了领导。就在当时，许多地方的领导同志也已经责备我们不善于为地方解决问题了。
    不重视科学知识的情况在粮食部的领导中曾经相当长期存在着。偏重政治条件，把政治条件提到不合理的高度，对于科学技术人材和高级知识分子的吸收、使用和培养，也产生了极其不良的后果。全国现在有6，000多所大米加工厂，但是没有一个工程师。现在，加工厂要求改进设备，仓库要求机械化，但全国还没有一个专业制造粮食加工和仓库机械的工厂。国家和人民对粮食工作的要求是一天一天地提高，时代逼迫着我们要从各个工作方面现代化起来。那就必须请求教育部门帮助我们以更大的速度培养科学技术人材；还要请求机械制造部门指定专门的机构、工厂，研究、试制现代化的技术设备。粮食部门财务情况根本好转
    在近一年间，粮食部门的财务情况有了根本的改变。自从去年春天粮食部的领导思想取得一致，肯定了经济核算制、批判了供给制思想，共同向各省、市粮食厅、局布置财务盈亏指标以后，结合着客观条件的好转，去年下半年就由亏损转为盈余。分省、市来看，最突出的是浙江省，1954年亏损2，493万元，去年转为盈余656万元，费用水平比1954年降低了30.69％，仅为卖钱额的9.58％。此外，也还有一些成绩很差的单位。这说明了粮食部门的节约潜力是很大的。活生生的事实批判了过去那些认为粮食工作注定要赔钱和赔钱才能稳定粮食市场的保守思想。现在看来，尽管当时有许多不利的客观因素，只要有足够的主观努力，做到少赔以至不赔仍然是可能的。目前的一般规律是：只要那个地方的领导上重视了财务工作，就往往可以做到既能稳定粮食市场，又能为国家积累资金；只有很少数情况特殊的地区是例外。从今年开始，粮食部门将能够经常每年上缴为数不多的利润。
    粮食部门盈余的获得，主要依靠点滴的节约。分区产销平衡合理运输制度的实行，使得我们可以减少省间运输量100多万吨；再加上上文所说的基层合理运输的贯彻，全年可以节约运费1亿多元。这是一个最大的节约项目，但也是由各地区、各基层点逐批逐笔地精打细算，点滴积累起来的。点滴节约的最生动的例子是旧面粉袋给价收回再用，看来是最微小不过的事情了，但全国全年就可以为国家节约2，800多万元，那就不是一件小事情了。改进领导工作，发扬民主
    如上所说，大家可以看到，我们粮食部过去的保守思想是严重的。批判了保守思想之后，是否又会来一个冒进？这还没有检查出来。即使有，可能也只是写在纸上的东西。目前在实际工作中所遇到的，主要的还是保守思想的复发。保证领导思想的正确，根本的条件将是民主制度的贯彻和业务钻研的深透。只要真正发扬民主，干部和群众就不会允许我们保守，也不会允许我们冒进；只要业务钻研深透，在发扬民主的基础上大家可以根据事实讲道理，保守和冒进也都不可能得势。业务是愈到下面愈细致、愈具体，我们做上级的是很难完全掌握的。因此，必须把这些具体的业务问题下放到下级的主管机构，责成它研究，鼓励它作出初步的决定，而上级只须作最后的核定；有许多事情甚至可以直接帮助、鼓励下级去负责执行，而上级只须及时进行检查。这样做，我们就可以在工作中培养出来千千万万的大大小小的专门家。这也是发扬民主的一个方面。有了民主制度，有了专门家，还必须通过法律、法令、规章、制度和计划，来体现既要反对保守思想，又要防止急躁冒进的方针，这才不会使下面感觉到今天一阵风，明天另外一阵风，有些无所适从。尽管这一切都具备了，我们还得学习共产党许多领导同志们的耐性。因为，批判了保守主义、群众的积极性发动起来之后，事情是很繁多而又很复杂的，民主的发扬也是如此。只要稍微不耐烦地简单化地去对待，就会伤害群众的积极性和民主精神。
    我感觉到十分高兴，中共中央和毛主席正确而又及时地提出了调动一切积极因素共同建设社会主义的指示。我们大家必须下重大决心，用最积极的态度把这个指示不折不扣地贯彻到各项工作中去，保证我们由已经获得的辉煌的胜利走向更伟大的胜利。
    以上意见，提请各位代表批评、指正。还请求各位代表多多地检查各级的粮食工作，及时纠正我们的缺点。
