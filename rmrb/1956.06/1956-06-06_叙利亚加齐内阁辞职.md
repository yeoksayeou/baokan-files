Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 5th: According to an official announcement on the evening of June 4th, Syrian President Kuwatly has accepted the resignation of the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Ghazzi. The President has asked Ghazzi to continue in office until a new government is formed.

The Ghazzi cabinet submitted its resignation on June 2nd. It is reported that the direct cause of the resignation was a disagreement within the cabinet over banning the export of wheat to France and the French forces stationed in Algeria.

Earlier on June 2nd, dockworkers in Latakia refused to load a batch of wheat. Subsequently, students demonstrated at the office of Economic Minister Antaki. They demanded a ban on the export of wheat to France and Algeria in protest against French atrocities in Algeria.

    叙利亚加齐内阁辞职
    新华社5日讯　大马士革消息：据官方六月四日晚上宣布，叙利亚总统库阿特利已经接受了以加齐总理为首的内阁的辞呈。总统请加齐继续执政直到新政府组成时为止。
    加齐内阁是在六月二日提出辞呈的。据报道，辞职的直接原因是内阁内部在禁止把小麦输出给法国和驻阿尔及利亚法军的问题上发生分歧。
    在六月二日早些时候，码头工人在拉塔基亚拒绝装运一批小麦。随后学生在经济部长安塔基办公的地方举行了示威。他们要求禁止把小麦输出到法国和阿尔及利亚去，以抗议法国在阿尔及利亚的暴行。
