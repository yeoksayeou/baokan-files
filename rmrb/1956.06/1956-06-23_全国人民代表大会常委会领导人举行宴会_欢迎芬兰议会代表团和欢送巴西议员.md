Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd – The Finnish Parliamentary Delegation from Europe and the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies members from South America, together with leaders of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, gathered happily tonight to toast the friendly cooperation between the people and parliaments of the three countries.

At this banquet held to welcome the Finnish Parliamentary Delegation and bid farewell to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies members, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: This is the first contact between our National People's Congress and the Finnish Parliament, and the visit of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies members to our country will greatly help to promote mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of China and Finland and Brazil, help the development of trade and cultural exchanges between China and Finland and Brazil, and may make a positive contribution to promoting world peace.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi also mentioned that although the Chinese people have made some achievements in the cause of building the motherland, there are still many shortcomings in our progress that need to be overcome through our efforts. Chairman Liu Shaoqi warmly welcomed Finnish friends to extensively understand the real situation of all aspects of China, including the good and the bad, during their visit to China, and asked Brazilian friends who have already visited China to offer beneficial opinions frankly.

The head of the Finnish Parliamentary Delegation, Väinö Johannes Sukselainen, said at the banquet: The people of Finland and China have a common cause, and I believe that this cause also belongs to the people of Brazil, which is to promote world peace and enhance mutual understanding. He added that mutual exchanges between the people of various countries can promote the achievement of this goal. He said, let us work for the friendship between the three countries and the cause of peace.

Brazilian Chamber of Deputies member Licurgo Leite Filho said at the meeting, when talking about his impressions of China, that everything we saw in China that the Chinese people are doing can only have one purpose: to strive for a strong, prosperous, and happy construction of the motherland in a peaceful environment. This desire for peace also belongs to the people of Brazil. He also warmly congratulated "the Finnish parliamentary colleagues for having a pleasant time in China, like us."

Tonight, the Finnish Ambassador to China, Sundström, was also invited to attend the banquet.

Among those attending the banquet tonight were Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, and members of the Standing Committee, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun, heads of various people's organizations, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, and other relevant ministers and vice ministers.
