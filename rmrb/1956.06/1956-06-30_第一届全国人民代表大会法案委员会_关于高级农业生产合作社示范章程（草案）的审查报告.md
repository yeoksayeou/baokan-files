The First National People's Congress Legislative Bill Committee
Report on the Review of the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives
(Passed by the plenary meeting of the First National People's Congress Legislative Bill Committee on June 29, 1956)
Deputy Director of the Legislative Bill Committee of the First National People's Congress, Wu XinYu

The First National People's Congress Legislative Bill Committee, after listening to the explanation made to the Congress by Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, regarding the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives submitted by the State Council to the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, held a total of four meetings and conducted a review. It believes that: the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives are suitable for the urgent needs of the current agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production development in our country. It summarizes the new experiences in the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement from the primary stage to the advanced stage, reflects the demands and aspirations of farmers nationwide to resolutely follow the socialist road, and is an important guarantee for further planned and large-scale development of agricultural production, improving the material and cultural living standards of farmers, and thoroughly completing the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The Legislative Bill Committee comprehensively studied the amendments proposed by the delegates in the group discussions. In addition to making textual modifications and some adjustments in order to make certain articles which were not written precisely or specifically enough, the supplementary modifications in terms of content that need to be explained are as follows:

I. In order to take care of cooperative members who have completely lost their ability to work and have historically relied on land for their livelihood, the following provision has been added to Article 14: "Their lives should be maintained with public welfare funds, and when necessary, appropriate land remuneration may also be temporarily given." After advanced agricultural production cooperatives implement collective ownership of land and abolish land remuneration, members who have completely lost their ability to work and need to be taken care of should originally have their lives maintained by the cooperative's public welfare fund. However, considering that advanced cooperatives have not been established for long and the public welfare fund is not yet large enough, if all expenses are paid from the public welfare fund, it may affect other public welfare undertakings within the cooperative or still fail to solve the difficulties of members who have lost their ability to work. Therefore, a special and relatively flexible provision was made: "When necessary, appropriate land remuneration may also be temporarily given." In the initial stage of establishment, some advanced cooperatives adopt a transitional approach in some aspects, that is to say, basically realizing collective ownership and abolishing remuneration for the means of production, while temporarily using the methods of primary cooperatives on individual issues. This precisely reflects the objective reality of the gradual transition of China's agricultural socialist transformation, which is necessary and should be allowed. In addition to the above-mentioned provisions in Article 14 of the draft regulations, Article 18 and Article 19 of the original draft regulations also made more flexible provisions for large areas of economic forests, timber forests, and herds of livestock: "In the initial stage of the cooperative, they can temporarily remain privately owned by the members and be managed uniformly by the cooperative." We believe that these are necessary.

II. The original draft has already made general provisions for the care of families of military personnel, families of martyrs, and disabled soldiers. Many representatives believe that there should be specific provisions. Considering that the State Council is drafting new preferential treatment measures for families of military personnel, families of martyrs, and disabled soldiers, the following paragraph has been added to Article 14: "For cooperative members who are families of military personnel, families of martyrs, and disabled soldiers, the cooperative should also provide preferential treatment in accordance with the preferential treatment measures stipulated by the state."

III. In order to take care of people who live in the countryside, whose labor force is outside, and who have no one at home to participate in labor, a supplement has been made to Article 15 of the draft regulations, so that these people can receive the same care as those who are engaged in urban occupations and whose whole family lives in the city. With such a provision, it is possible to take care of the living difficulties of these people, prevent the private land of these people from being荒芜 (allowed to go to waste), and avoid the problem of forcing these people to join the cooperative.

IV. With regard to the care of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, Article 14 and Article 15 of the draft regulations, which concern taking care of cooperative members who have completely lost their ability to work and taking care of those engaged in urban occupations, whose whole family lives in the city, or who live in the countryside, whose labor force is outside, and who have no one at home to participate in labor, as well as the various provisions that must take care of female cooperative members in labor, all apply equally to returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. In addition, the following provisions have been added to Articles 49, 58, and 61: "In areas with returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, the cooperative must pay special attention to uniting returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to run the cooperative well." (Article 49) "... In areas with returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, ... returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese cooperative members should also occupy an appropriate proportion in the number of representatives." (Article 58) "If there are a considerable number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in the cooperative, they should also occupy an appropriate number in the leadership and staff." (Article 61)

V. An additional chapter of supplementary provisions has also been added, with a total of three articles. Article 62 stipulates: "If the provisions of the Model Regulations of Agricultural Production Cooperatives adopted for primary cooperatives do not conflict with these regulations and are needed by advanced cooperatives, the advanced cooperatives may adopt them." With this provision, the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives can be written simply, without having to repeat things that have already been stipulated in detail in the Model Regulations adopted for primary cooperatives. At the same time, in order to adapt to the specific conditions of each province and city, Article 63 stipulates: "Each province and city may, in accordance with local conditions and needs, make supplementary provisions for matters not stipulated or not specifically stipulated in these regulations." In order to adapt to the characteristics of various ethnic autonomous regions, Article 64 stipulates: "Ethnic autonomous regions may, in accordance with the characteristics and actual needs of local ethnic groups, make supplementary provisions for matters not stipulated or not specifically stipulated in these regulations, or may formulate model regulations applicable to local cooperatives based on the basic principles of these regulations."

In addition, some representatives also put forward many good opinions on the work of agricultural production cooperatives in group discussions, but because they are not matters within the scope of the cooperative regulations, they have not been written in.

The Legislative Bill Committee recommends that the Third Session of the First National People's Congress approve the revised draft of the Model Regulations of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives in its entirety.

    第一届全国人民代表大会法案委员会
    关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的审查报告
    （1956年6月29日第一届全国人民代表大会法案委员会全体会议通过）
    全国人民代表大会法案委员会副主任委员　武新宇
    第一届全国人民代表大会法案委员会对国务院向第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议提出的高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案），在听了中华人民共和国农业部长廖鲁言向大会所作的说明以后，先后共召开了四次会议，进行了审查，认为：高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）是适合于我国当前农业合作化运动和农业生产发展的迫切需要的，它总结了农业合作化运动由初级阶段向高级阶段发展中的新的经验，反映了全国农民坚决走社会主义道路的要求和愿望，是进一步有计划地大规模地发展农业生产、提高农民物质和文化生活水平、彻底完成对农业的社会主义改造的重要保证。
    法案委员会综合研究了各位代表在小组讨论中所提出的修改意见，除对草案中写得不够确切或者不够具体的一些条文，作了文字上的修改和某些次序上的调整以外，在内容方面的补充修改，需要加以说明的，有以下几点：
    一、为了照顾完全丧失劳动力、历来靠土地维持生活的社员，在第十四条中增加了以下的规定：“应该用公益金维持他们的生活，在必要的时候，也可以暂时给以适当的土地报酬。”在高级农业生产合作社实行土地归集体所有，取消了土地报酬以后，对于完全丧失劳动力而又需要给以照顾的社员，本来应该用合作社的公益金来维持他们的生活，但是考虑到高级合作社建立不久，公益金还不多，如果都从公益金中开支，就可能影响社内的其他公益事业，或者仍然解决不了丧失劳动力的社员的困难，所以作了特殊的比较灵活的规定，
  “在必要的时候，也可以暂时给以适当的土地报酬。”某些高级合作社在初建时期，在某些方面采取一种过渡的办法，就是说，基本上实现集体所有制，取消生产资料的报酬，而在个别问题上暂时沿用初级社的办法，这正是反映了我国农业社会主义改造事业逐步过渡的客观实际，这是必要的，应该允许的。除了章程草案第十四条中的上述规定以外，章程原草案第十八条和第十九条对于大量的成片的经济林、用材林和成群的牧畜也作了较灵活的规定：
  “在合作社初建的时候，可以暂时仍属社员私有，由合作社统一经营。”我们认为这些都是必要的。
    二、对于军人家属、烈士家属和残废军人的照顾，原草案中已经作了一般规定。不少代表认为应该有具体的规定。我们考虑到国务院正在拟定关于军人家属、烈士家属和残废军人的新的优待办法，所以在第十四条中增加了以下一款：“对于军人家属、烈士家属和残废军人的社员，合作社还应该按照国家规定的优待办法给以优待。”
    三、为了照顾家居乡村、劳动力外出、家中无人参加劳动的人，在章程草案第十五条中作了补充，使这种人同从事城市的职业、全家居住城市的人一样，得到同样的照顾。有了这样的规定，既能够照顾这些人的生活困难，又可以使这些人的私有的土地不致荒芜，还可以避免强迫这些人入社的毛病。
    四、对于归国华侨和侨眷的照顾，章程草案第十四条和第十五条关于照顾完全丧失劳动力的社员和照顾从事城市的职业、全家居住城市的人或者家居乡村、劳动力外出、家中无人参加劳动的人的规定，以及在劳动中必须照顾女社员的各条规定，都同样适用于归国华侨和侨眷。此外，在第四十九条、五十八条和六十一条中，还补充了以下的规定：“在有归国华侨和侨眷的地区，合作社要特别注意团结归国华侨和侨眷办好合作社。”（第四十九条）
  “……在有归国华侨、侨眷的地区，……归国华侨、侨眷社员也应该在代表的名额里面占有适当的比例。”（第五十八条）“如果合作社内有相当数量的归国华侨和侨眷，他们在领导人员和工作人员里面也要占有适当的名额。”（第六十一条）
    五、还增加了一章附则，共有三条。第六十二条规定：“供初级合作社采用的农业生产合作社示范章程的规定，如果同本章程不相抵触又为高级合作社所需要的，高级合作社可以采用。”有了这条规定，就使高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）可以写得简单一点，不必重复供初级合作社采用的示范章程中已经详尽规定了的东西。同时，为了适应各省、市的具体情况，第六十三条规定：“各省、市依照当地的情况和需要，可以对于本章程没有规定或者没有具体规定的事情，作出补充规定。”为了适应各民族自治地方的特点，第六十四条规定：“民族自治地方，依照当地民族的特点和实际的需要，可以对于本章程没有规定或者没有具体规定的事情，作出补充的规定，也可以根据本章程基本原则制定出适用于当地合作社的示范章程。”
    此外，有些代表在小组讨论中还提出了许多有关农业生产合作社工作方面好的意见，因为不是属于合作社章程规定范围内的事情，所以没有写进去。
    法案委员会建议第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议，对高级农业生产合作社示范章程修正草案，全案予以通过。
