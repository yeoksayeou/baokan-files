    Go East
    By Ji Qing, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    At noon on June 3rd, the Yaroslavsky Station in Moscow, the gateway to the East, was bustling with activity. Green carriages were adorned with huge banners reading, "Friends, we are going to the distant frontier!" The front of the train displayed a large poster depicting young people with backpacks, standing shoulder to shoulder, pointing to the eastern and northern regions on a map of the Soviet Union, with the bold characters "I'm Going!" below.
    Moscow's youth continued to gather at the station, heading to the east of the motherland. The crowds who came to see them off surrounded them in circles. The band played moving melodies, and some people danced to the captivating rhythms…
      Viktor and Doria, just graduated from middle school, are two brothers. On the night they decided to go east, the whole family gathered around the map spread out on the table, even the youngest sister, Lidoka, squeezed in, searching for the unfamiliar place names in the distant east and north of the motherland. Although everyone knew it was not a comfortable place, the whole family was attracted by the countless undeveloped underground treasures and its beautiful prospects.
      "There will be difficulties in the future!" Their father, Mr. and Mrs. Mielkesen, said to them, "What do you think?"
    The children replied without hesitation, "We can persevere!"
    The father knew that his sons were not afraid of difficulties. He thought of his own journey into life, which also relied on everyone's joint efforts. Would his sons be worse than him? He believed that they would bravely undertake this difficult task. He said to his sons, "Your decision is right, children! Do as you think best!"
    Countless fathers and mothers in Moscow resolutely supported their children's decisions in this way. In a very short period of time, 22,000 young people in Moscow signed up in response to the call of the Party and the government to participate in the great construction of the Sixth Five-Year Plan in the east and north of the motherland. Igor's mother, one of the first volunteers, is an old weaver who has worked in the "Three Mountains" textile factory for thirty-six years. Three generations of her family have worked in the "Three Mountains" textile factory: her parents, herself, and her children. She expressed great satisfaction with her son's taking on a new job, with a mother's proud expression on her face. At the capital's youth conference held in the Great Kremlin Palace, she said to everyone, "Although my son is still very young, and it is difficult for me to separate from him, I fully agree with my son's decision. I am happy that he can respond to the Party's call and take on the task of the Sixth Five-Year Plan."
    The rich east and north are powerfully calling the Soviet youth. People know that there are more than half of the country's water resources, the huge power stations that will soon be built on the many large rivers, the rich coal and iron ore deposits, the boundless forests, and the vast land. All of this strongly attracts the hearts of every young person, making them willing to leave their beloved hometown, familiar relatives and friends, and familiar factories, and go to distant places.
    In response to the call of the Party and the government, many young people in Moscow have applied to the Youth League organization to go to places where the motherland needs them. Svinarev, a lathe operator at the "Red Proletarian" factory, and his companions said to their friends before parting, "Of course, it is not easy to separate from dear Moscow and dear friends, but when we think of the interesting and important work waiting for us, we can't sit still."
    The time to leave arrived, the whistle sounded, and the train slowly started, leaving the platform. The young volunteers, carrying the teachings of the Party and government leaders at the youth conference held in the Great Kremlin Palace the day before, bearing the earnest expectations of their gray-haired parents and the kind farewells of their friends, marched heroically towards the fighting posts of developing the east and north.

    到东方去
    本报驻苏联记者　纪青
    六月三日中午，莫斯科的通往东方的雅罗斯拉夫车站热闹起来。绿色车厢上挂着巨大的横幅标语，写着“朋友们，我们到远方的边疆去！”车头上披着一幅很大的标语画，那画上的青年们背着背包，雄赳赳地并肩站着，用手指着苏联地图上的东部和北部地区，下面写着两个大字“我去！”
    到祖国的东方去的莫斯科青年们继续汇集在车站上，来送行的人群将他们围成一个个的圈子，乐队演奏着动人的曲子，有的人就踏着这令人神往的旋律跳起舞来
  ……。
      刚从中学毕业的维克多和多利亚是两兄弟，在他们决定到东方去的那一天夜晚，全家人围着看摊开在桌面上的地图，连最小的妹妹黎多卡也挤在一起，寻找那祖国遥远的东方和北方的那些不熟悉的地名。虽然谁也知道那里并不是安逸的地方，但是全家的人都被那无数尚未开发的地下宝藏和它的美丽远景所吸引了。
      “将来会有困难的！”父亲麦尔克森和母亲对他们说：“你们怎样想呢？”
    孩子们毫不犹疑地回答说：“我们能坚持下去的！”
    父亲是知道儿子们不怕困难的。他想到自己走向生活的当年，也是靠大家一齐奋斗的，难道自己的儿子会比自己差一些吗？他相信他们会勇敢地担当起这个困难的任务来。他向儿子们说：“你们的决定是对的，孩子们！照着你们的意见办吧！”
    莫斯科无数的父亲和母亲都是这样毅然决然支持了自己儿女们的决定。仅仅在很短的时间里，莫斯科就有两万二千青年报名响应党和政府的号召，到祖国的东方和北方去参加第六个五年计划的伟大建设。第一批志愿者当中的伊果尔的母亲，是一个老织布女工，在“三山”纺织厂已经工作三十六年了。她一家三代都是在“三山”纺织厂做工，父母，她和儿女。她对自己的儿子走上新的工作岗位表示非常满意，脸上流露出母亲的骄傲的神情。她在大克里姆林宫举行的首都青年大会上向大家说：“虽然我的儿子还很年轻，我很难和他分离，但是我还是完全赞同儿子的决定的，我为他能响应党的号召、担负起第六个五年计划的任务而感到高兴。”
    富饶的东方和北方，是那样有力地召唤着苏联的青年们，人们知道那里有占全国一半以上的水力富源，那许多条巨大的河流上即将建立起来的巨大的发电站，那丰富的煤藏、铁矿，无边无际的大森林，辽阔的土地，这一切都强烈地吸引着每个青年的心。使他们舍得离开自己亲爱的故乡、熟悉的亲友和熟悉的工厂，走向遥远的地方。
    莫斯科的青年为响应党和政府的号召，很多人都向团的组织申请到祖国需要的地方去。“红色无产者”工厂的旋工斯维那列夫和他的同伴们告别之前对自己的朋友们说：“当然和亲爱的莫斯科，亲爱的朋友们分离是不容易的，但一想到那样有趣的重要的工作在等待着我们，就说什么也坐不住了。”
    开车的时间到了，汽笛响了，车身缓缓地开动起来，走出了月台。青年志愿者们带着前一天在大克里姆林宫中举行的青年大会上党政领导人员的教诲，带着鬓发霜白的父母们的殷切的期望和朋友们亲切的送别，豪迈地走向开发东方和北方的战斗的岗位。
