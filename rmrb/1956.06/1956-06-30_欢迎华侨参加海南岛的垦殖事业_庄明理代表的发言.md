    After listening to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, I fully agree and suggest that the Congress approve the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, and adopt the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives and the work report of the Standing Committee.

    The day before yesterday, I heard Director He Xiangning's speech on overseas Chinese affairs policies and overseas Chinese affairs work, and I expressed my heartfelt support. Director He pointed out in her speech the call for overseas Chinese to return to China to participate in the country's economic construction and develop the reclamation of Hainan Island, which I think is a call that benefits the country and overseas Chinese, and it is a good thing.

    In the past few years, overseas Chinese have made some achievements in participating in the socialist construction of the motherland. More than 30 factories and a number of other enterprises have been established with investment in Guangdong and Fujian. These factories and enterprises may seem like a drop in the ocean in the vigorous development of the country's various construction undertakings, but they reflect the patriotic and love-of-hometown enthusiasm of overseas Chinese, which is valuable and something that many foreign capitalists cannot understand.

    Regarding guiding overseas Chinese to participate in the development of Hainan Island, I think this is very meaningful. At the end of last year, I accompanied Mr. Chen Jiageng to Hainan Island to inspect rubber plantations. This April, I also participated in a Hainan Island reclamation and tropical economic crop survey team organized by the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to conduct on-the-spot investigations. From what I learned from these two times, I feel that Hainan Island has very good conditions for planting tropical economic crops.

    Hainan Island is located at the southern end of our country, south of 20 degrees north latitude, close to the tropical climate of Southeast Asia. The island has a total area of more than 33,500 square kilometers, the second largest island in our country, but the population is very small, only more than 2.7 million people, so the land utilization rate is still very low. The existing cultivated land area accounts for only about 11% of the total area, and 40% of the land has not been utilized. According to a recent survey by the Guangdong Provincial Subtropical Resources Development Committee, there are still about 18 million mu of land to be developed. Those undeveloped wasteland are very fertile, and the trees covering the surface are growing very vigorously.

    The characteristics of Hainan Island are its rich and colorful Southeast Asian scenery. All kinds of Southeast Asian specialties such as coconut, coffee, betel nut, pepper, pineapple, etc. are all available on this island. And the most eye-catching thing is rubber. In the past, many people doubted whether rubber could be planted on Hainan Island. Recently, I met a few friends in Guangzhou who had just returned from Singapore. They heard abroad that the rubber planted by overseas Chinese on Hainan Island before the War of Resistance Against Japan had all failed. I showed them the photos I took of the rubber trees and workers harvesting rubber in the new and old rubber plantations on Hainan Island, proving that the rubber on Hainan Island had not failed. The so-called failure was not that the rubber did not grow, but that it failed due to the devastation under the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek and during the occupation of the Japanese militarists. That kind of failure is understandable. After liberation, we have reorganized and restored those old rubber plantations in the past, and they are all in production.

    In addition to the old rubber plantations on Hainan Island, the state has reclaimed more than 400,000 mu after liberation, and overseas Chinese have also reclaimed 20,000 to 30,000 mu. Some of the rubber plantations of overseas Chinese have already started grafting, which is still the latest method in Hainan Island. I hope that relevant departments will vigorously promote this grafting to increase rubber production.

    The state-owned rubber plantations on Hainan Island are somewhat different from the rubber plantations run by overseas Chinese. In my opinion, the general rubber plantations of overseas Chinese are better than the state-owned rubber plantations. For example, the rubber seedlings planted in the same year, 1952, now have a girth of 35 cm for the good rubber trees in the overseas Chinese rubber plantations, and about 20 cm for the worse ones. The branches and leaves of the rubber trees are growing vigorously. However, the rubber trees in the state-owned rubber plantations are less than 20 cm, or even more than 10 cm, and their branches and leaves are thin and weak. Why is there such a big difference? The main reason is that the management is not effective, and they do not absorb the successful experience of others. They adhere to one-sided theories and act arbitrarily. This attitude will be harmful to the development of the rubber industry. I hope that the relevant parties will pay attention to it in time.

    When Mr. Chen Jiageng inspected Hainan Island last year, he said that the problem with rubber on Hainan Island is not whether it can be planted or not, but whether people know how to manage it and the planting methods. Director He Xiangning also said at this enlarged meeting on overseas Chinese affairs that we should learn from the Soviet Union in building socialist industry, but we must learn from overseas Chinese in planting rubber. The words of Mr. Chen and Director He clearly pointed out the correct direction for us to plant rubber.

    Malaysia has more than 4 million acres (equivalent to 26 million Chinese mu) of rubber plantations. The planting of these rubber plantations is inseparable from the pioneering and hard work of overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese have rich technology and experience in planting rubber. If we can guide that technology and experience to the motherland, it will contribute to the rubber industry on Hainan Island. For this reason, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has decided to allocate 500,000 to 600,000 mu of wasteland on Hainan Island for overseas Chinese to plant rubber and establish various types of reclamation farms. I think this measure is timely.

    The motherland's industrial construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. The First Automobile Factory will soon produce cars. The Second and Third Automobile Factories and aircraft factories will follow. The demand for rubber for automobile tires, aircraft tires, and belts and rubber hoses for various factories will increase day by day, but rubber production is still far from meeting the actual needs. Planting rubber is different from developing other resources. For example, in mining, if we need coal, we march towards the coal mine and the coal comes out; if we need oil, we drill wells towards the oil field and the oil comes out; but if we need rubber, we have to plant it and wait for ten or eight years before it can be produced. The rubber to be used in the Third Five-Year Plan must be planted today, otherwise, we will fall behind the needs.

    Overseas Chinese love the motherland. As long as the motherland needs it, they will definitely be willing to contribute their abilities to the motherland and work together with the people of the motherland to build socialism.

    欢迎华侨参加海南岛的垦殖事业
    ——庄明理代表的发言
    听了李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明和彭真副委员长所作全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，我完全同意，建议大会批准1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，并通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程和常委会的工作报告。
    前天听到何香凝主任对侨务政策和侨务工作的发言，我表示衷心的拥护，何主任在发言中指出了有关号召华侨回国参加祖国的经济建设和开发海南岛的垦殖事业，我觉得这是一项利国利侨的号召，是一件好事。
    几年来华侨参加祖国社会主义建设是有了一些成就，在广东和福建投资建立的已有30多个工厂和若干其他企业。那些工厂和企业在整个国家各项建设事业蓬勃发展中看来，虽然只是仓中一粟，但它却反映了华侨爱国爱乡的热情，这种热情是可贵的，是许多外国资本家们想不通的事。
    关于引导华侨参加开发海南岛的问题，我想这是很有意义的。我去年年底曾随陈嘉庚先生去海南岛视察橡胶园，今年四月间又参加中央侨委会组织的一个海南岛垦殖热带经济作物调查组，到那里进行实地调查。从这两次所了解的情况，觉得海南岛对种植热带经济作物是有很好的条件。
    海南岛位于我国的南端，在北纬20度以南，接近于南洋的热带气候。全岛总面积33，500多平方公里，为我国第二大岛，但人口却很少，仅270多万人，因而土地利用率还很低，现有耕地面积仅占总面积的11％左右，还有40％的土地未被利用。据广东省亚热带资源开发委员会最近调查，尚待开发的土地有1，800万亩左右，那些未被开发的荒地都很肥沃，被复面的树木长得非常壮茂。
    海南岛的特点是有着丰富多采的南洋景色，南洋所有的各种土特产如椰子、咖啡、槟榔、胡椒、菠萝等等，在这个岛上应有尽有。而最引人注意的是橡胶。过去不少人对海南岛能种植橡胶存着怀疑。最近我在广州碰见几位刚从新加坡回来的朋友，他们在国外听说抗战前华侨在海南岛种的橡胶都失败了，我把这次在海南岛新旧橡胶园所照的胶树和工人们在收割胶的情况的照片给他们看，证明了海南岛的橡胶并没有失败，所谓失败并不是橡胶不成长，而是失败于蒋介石反动统治下及日本军阀占领时期所受到的摧残。那种失败是可以理解的。解放后我们已经把过去那些旧胶园整理恢复起来了，并且都在生产了。
    海南岛除旧胶园外，解放后国家又垦殖了40多万亩，华侨也垦殖了两三万亩，华侨的胶园有的已经开始进行芽接了，那种接法在海南岛来说，还是最新的。我希望有关部门大力推广这种芽接，以提高橡胶的产量。
    海南岛国营的橡胶园与华侨经营的橡胶园是有些不同的，据我看来，一般的华侨胶园都比国营胶园搞得好。例如同是1952年定植的胶苗，华侨胶园现在好的胶树已有35公分的围径，差点的也有20公分左右，胶树的枝叶都长得又壮又茂。而国营胶园的胶树却还不到20公分，甚至有10多公分的，而且他的枝叶长得又瘦又弱。为什么会相差这么远呢？主要是经营管理不得法，又不吸收人家的成功经验，持片面的理论，自行其是，这种态度将有害于橡胶专业的发展，希望有关方面及时注意。
    去年陈嘉庚先生视察海南岛时，曾说过海南岛的橡胶不是可种不可种，而是晓得不晓得经营管理和种植方法的问题。何香凝主任在这次侨务扩大会议上也说过，我们建设社会主义工业要向苏联学习，但种植橡胶就不能不向华侨学习。陈先生与何主任的话很清楚地为我们指出了种橡胶的正确方向。
    马来亚现有400多万英亩（等于2，600万华亩）的橡胶园，这些橡胶园的种植与华侨的披荆斩棘、辛勤劳动是分不开的，因此华侨对种植橡胶的技术与经验是丰富的，如果我们能够好好的把华侨那种技术和经验引导到祖国来，对海南岛的橡胶事业是会有所贡献的。为此中央侨委会已决定，要在海南岛领五、六十万亩的荒地，让华侨种植橡胶和建立各种类型的垦殖场。我想这一措施是及时的。
    祖国工业建设正在突飞猛进，第一汽车厂很快就要出车了，第二、第三汽车厂和飞机厂接着就要来，汽车轮胎、飞机轮胎以及各项工厂的皮带、胶管所需的橡胶，将会一天比一天多，但是橡胶的生产却还离实际需要很远。种植橡胶与开发其他资源不同，比如开矿来说，我们需要煤，向煤矿进军，煤就出来；需要油，向油田打井，油就出来；但需要橡胶，种下去还须等它十年、八年才能生产。第三个五年计划要用的橡胶，今天就要种，不然，我们就会落在需要的后面。
    华侨是热爱祖国的，只要祖国需要，他们一定愿意把自己的所能贡献给祖国，与祖国人民一道为建设社会主义而奋斗。
