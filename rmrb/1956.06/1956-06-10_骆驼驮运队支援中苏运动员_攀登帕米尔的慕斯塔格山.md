    Camel Caravan Supports Chinese and Soviet Athletes
    Climbing Muztagh Ata in the Pamirs
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Kexian reports: A long caravan consisting of sixty-three camels set off from Kashgar on the afternoon of the 8th, heading to the shore of Lake Karakul at the foot of Muztagh Ata peak in the Pamirs, which is 7,546 meters above sea level.

    These camels are carrying more than 12,000 catties of grain, fodder, a large quantity of canned meats such as beef, mutton, chicken, and fish, as well as dried apricots, sour plums, raisins, and the famous Sichuan pickled mustard tuber. These supplies are the first batch of materials prepared by the Kashgar Support Committee for the Sino-Soviet Mountaineering Team, which was established on May 30th.

    Lake Karakul is located more than 700 li from Kashgar and will be the site of the base camp for Chinese and Soviet athletes. To reach this base camp from Kashgar, the camel caravan must traverse mountains and valleys, undertaking a long journey of fourteen days. After reaching Lake Karakul, the camel caravan will also go to the Sino-Soviet border to receive a large quantity of supplies from the Soviet Union to support the mountaineering team.

      Two mountaineering athletes from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also departed from Kashgar with the caravan on this day to participate in the preparatory work.

    骆驼驮运队支援中苏运动员
    攀登帕米尔的慕斯塔格山
    新华社讯　新华社记者杨克现报道：一支由六十三峰骆驼组成的一长列驮运队，八日下午从喀什出发，前往帕米尔高原拔海7，546公尺的慕斯塔格山峰下的哈拉库里湖畔。
    这些骆驼身上驮运着一万两千多斤粮食、马料、大批的牛、羊、鸡、鱼等肉类罐头，以及杏干、酸梅、葡萄干等干果和著名的四川榨菜。这些东西是五月三十日成立的喀什支援中、苏混合爬山队委员会所筹备的第一批物资。
    哈拉库里湖距离喀什约有七百多华里，是将来中、苏运动员爬山大本营所在地。从喀什到达这个大本营，骆驼队必须翻山越岭，经过十四天的长途跋涉。这支骆驼队到哈拉库里湖畔后，还要去中、苏边境接运苏联支援爬山队的大量物资。
      中华全国总工会两名爬山运动员这一天也同驮运队一起从喀什出发，参加筹备工作。
