Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 21st: French Foreign Minister Pineau and US Secretary of State Dulles issued a joint communiqué on June 20th after holding three days of talks.

    Estimates of Soviet policy and what policies the West should adopt toward the Soviet Union were the main issues of the talks. Pineau said when leaving Paris that he was going to Washington to seek to coordinate Western policy toward the Soviet Union. However, the joint communiqué simply stated that Pineau spoke about his and Prime Minister Mollet's visit to Moscow. Dulles listened "very carefully" to Pineau's "explanation" of the situation in the Soviet Union.

    The communiqué said that they discussed Bulganin's letters to the French and American governments on disarmament. They stressed that a disarmament plan must be agreed upon within the framework of the United Nations, and that while extensively reducing armed forces, "major issues such as the reunification of Germany must be resolved."

    Dulles and Pineau reaffirmed the need to further strengthen the North Atlantic Group. They believe that it is important to expand political consultations among member states of this group and the group's cooperation in non-military aspects.

    Dulles expressed support for France's policy in Algeria, and they also expressed hope that the situation in the Middle East would be resolved within the framework of the United Nations. The communiqué also said that Pineau "explained in detail" his plan for assisting underdeveloped countries to Dulles.

    According to disclosed information, Pineau and Dulles had differences of opinion on certain issues during the talks.

    According to Associated Press reporter Scali, Pineau and Dulles could not agree on the specific steps that should be taken to deal with Soviet policy. Scali also said that Pineau suggested relaxing trade controls, having the United Nations control part of the US aid to backward countries, and conducting East-West cultural exchanges on a larger scale. And "Dulles expressed a clear lack of enthusiasm for these three suggestions from Pineau."

    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 22nd: French Foreign Minister Pineau left Washington on the 21st via New York by plane to return home.

    比诺和杜勒斯会谈结束
    双方对一些问题有分歧
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：法国外交部长比诺同美国国务卿杜勒斯举行三天会谈以后在六月二十日发表联合公报。
    对苏联政策的估计以及西方对苏联采取什么政策是这次会谈的主要问题。比诺在离开巴黎的时候就说，他是为了谋求协调西方对苏联的政策才去华盛顿的。但是，联合公报只是简单地说：比诺谈了他同摩勒总理在莫斯科的访问。杜勒斯“十分注意地”听取了比诺关于苏联情况的“解释”。
    公报说，他们讨论了布尔加宁给法美两国政府的关于裁军问题的信件。他们强调必须在联合国范围内商定一项裁军计划，而在实行广泛地裁减武装部队的同时，“必须解决德国重新统一等重大问题”。
    杜勒斯和比诺重申必须进一步加强北大西洋集团。他们认为扩大这个集团成员国之间的政治协商和集团的非军事方面的合作很重要。
    杜勒斯表示支持法国对阿尔及利亚的政策，他们并且表示希望在联合国的范围内解决中东的局势。公报还说，比诺向杜勒斯“详细说明了”他的关于援助不发达国家的计划。
    据透露出来的消息，比诺和杜勒斯在会谈中对于某些问题意见有分歧。
    据美联社记者斯卡利报道，比诺同杜勒斯在谈到对付苏联政策应该采取的明确步骤的时候，他们意见不能一致。斯卡利又说，比诺建议放宽贸易管制、由联合国来控制一部分援助落后国家的美援和在较大规模上进行东西方文化交流。而“杜勒斯对比诺这三点建议表示了明显的缺少热情”。
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：法国外交部长比诺已经在二十一日离开华盛顿经纽约乘飞机回国。
