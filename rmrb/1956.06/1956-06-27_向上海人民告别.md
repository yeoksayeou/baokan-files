The clock on the Shanghai Bund Customs House pointed to two o'clock, and the dawn of the 26th had arrived. But the Huangpu River was still brightly lit, and countless people stood densely packed along the riverbank all night long, taking one last look at the Soviet friendly visiting fleet moored in the heart of the river. In three hours, they would be full of the affection of the people of Shanghai, crossing more than a thousand nautical miles of ocean to return to the Soviet Union's eastern naval base in Vladivostok.

A speedboat carrying some reporters sailed towards the cruiser "Dmitry Pozharsky" to attend a press conference held by Vice Admiral Chekurov, commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet.

Vice Admiral Chekurov had just shaken hands with a large group of guests leaving the farewell banquet at the ship's gangway, and now he warmly received us. He still looked energetic, without a trace of fatigue. After Vice Admiral Chekurov sat down, several officers of the rank of colonel also came over. Some were wearing the red scarves given to him by Shanghai Young Pioneers, and some were wearing various commemorative badges given to him by Shanghai people, school badges, and Dragon Boat Festival sachets. (These unique souvenirs also appeared on many officers and soldiers on the ship.) Right on the table where the banquet had just been held, we began a pleasant conversation.

"We knew that we would receive a warm welcome when we came to visit China, but the result was that this enthusiasm far exceeded our expectations. The enthusiasm of the Shanghai people for us greatly moved us," said Vice Admiral Chekurov. "We have received many letters and gifts, all of which show the Chinese people's love for us. Many letters are filled with enthusiastic words."

Chekurov said that what he deeply remembered during the visit was the sincere friendship shown by the Chinese people to the Soviets, and everyone he came into contact with was like that. He said, "After the Soviet fleet docked on the Huangpu River, the wharf was crowded with enthusiastic Shanghai people day and night. As soon as our people walked onto the wharf, many hands would reach out together, just wanting to grab our hands and shake them tightly."

The comrades of the Soviet friendly visiting fleet received the same sincere reception everywhere they visited Shanghai factories, schools, and shops. He said, "Wherever they went, people told them everything, as if they were brothers." "We not only received such treatment in Shanghai, but also in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places we passed through, we received such brotherly treatment. When I was in Beijing, I met Premier Zhou and Marshal Peng Dehuai, and we talked very well."

Chekurov especially mentioned the reception for 300 Shanghai Young Pioneers on the cruiser on the 23rd. He said that this enthusiastic and sincere gathering moved everyone on the ship. "When the sailors helped the children leave the cruiser one by one, although we were all old, we shed tears."

"In Shanghai, we feel like we are at home. Today the fleet is leaving, and everyone on the ship feels the pain of parting. Almost all the sailors want to stay a few more days."

Speaking of the activities in Shanghai, Chekurov became even more active. He said, "Our song and dance troupe performed in Shanghai, and our team also played several games." He said humorously, "Of course, we have to examine ourselves in this regard. Our athletes are not good enough, and they have almost all lost."

"Not almost all lost, but all lost," said the naval lieutenant colonel sitting next to him with a smile. Chekurov also laughed!

"Yes, all lost, but we lost very happily, because we saw that the Chinese athletes' skills are so high and their bodies are so strong. Our athletes must practice hard when they go back."

The clock on the Bund Customs House chimed, and it was already half past two. A cool breeze blew from the Huangpu River onto the deck. Many sailors on the deck were still continuing to clean up. In the past five days, this deck had been imprinted with the footprints of more than 10,000 visitors from Shanghai, leaving unforgettable memories for the people of Shanghai and the Soviet visiting fleet. Chekurov repeatedly apologized and said that although they had contacted nearly 200,000 Shanghai people in these five days, and more than 10,000 people visited the fleet, it was a great regret that due to time constraints, they could not shake hands with more people and could not contact more Shanghai people. He sincerely said: "Please tell the people of Shanghai, thank you for your warm hospitality, and wish them good work and good health."

"I hope that through your newspaper, I can thank the comrades who wrote letters and sent gifts to us. I once again sincerely thank them and express my high respect to them. May we be better united in the struggle for peace."

We said to him: We will definitely do this, and tell the people about the friendship of Vice Admiral Chekurov and all the comrades of the Soviet friendly visiting fleet through the newspaper.

"I hope you will come to Vladivostok. The Soviet people of Vladivostok will definitely welcome you." Chekurov once again extended his powerful and warm hand.

When the small boat carried us to the west bank of the Huangpu River, the clock hand pointed to three o'clock. The sky was turning white. We kept looking back at the majestic appearance of the cruiser, where friends seemed to be still standing on the side of the ship looking at us.

    向上海人民告别
    本报记者  季音　习平
    上海外滩海关大楼的时针已指向二点，二十六日的黎明已经到来了。但黄浦江畔还是电灯通明，无数人密密层层地通宵站立在江边上，最后地探望着停泊在江心里的苏联友好访华舰队。在三小时之后，它们就要满载着上海人们的情谊，越过一千多浬的海洋驶返苏联东方的海军基地海参崴。
    一艘快艇载着一些记者，驶向“德米特里·波日阿尔斯基”号巡洋舰，去出席苏联太平洋舰队司令切库罗夫海军中将的记者招待会。
    切库罗夫海军中将刚才在船舷梯边上一个个的握着手，送走了告别宴会的一大群客人，现在又热诚地接待了我们。他依然显得精神旺盛，毫无倦容。切库罗夫海军中将坐下后，好几个校级军官也走了过来，他们有的系着上海少先队员送他的红领巾，有的身上挂着上海人送给他的各种纪念章，学校的校徽，端午节的香袋。（这些别致的纪念品也出现在舰上许多官兵的身上）就在刚举行过宴会的桌上，我们开始了愉快的谈话。
      “来中国访问，我们是知道一定会得到热情的招待的，但结果是，这样热情远远超过了我们的预料，上海人民对我们的热情使我们受到了极大的感动，”切库罗夫海军中将说，“我们收到了许多的信件和礼物，这些东西都说明着中国人民对我们的热爱，许多信件里写满着热情的语句。”
  切库罗夫说，在访问中使他深切难忘的是中国人民对苏联人所表现的真诚友谊，所有接触到的人都是这样。他说，“当苏联舰队停泊在黄浦江边后，码头上就整天到晚挤满着热情的上海人民，只要我们的人走到码头上，许多双手就一齐伸过来，只想抓住我们的手，紧紧地握一下”。
    苏联友好访华舰队的同志在参观上海工厂、学校、商店时，到处都受到同样真诚的接待，他说，“到什么地方，人们都是把什么都告诉他们，就像兄弟一般。”“我们不仅在上海受到这样的接待，在南京，在杭州，以及其他走过的地方，我们都受到这样兄弟般的接待。在北京时，我见到了周总理，彭德怀元帅，都谈得很好。”
    切库罗夫特别说到二十三日巡洋舰上招待上海三百个少先队员的事，他说，这次热情真诚的集会使全船的人都受到了感动，“当水兵们一个个扶着孩子们离开巡洋舰的时候，虽然我们都已是有了年纪的人，但我们都流下了眼泪。”
    “在上海，我们就好像在自己家里一样，今天舰队要离开了，全舰的人都感到离别的难受，几乎所有的水兵都要求能多留几天。”
    说到在上海的活动，切库罗夫更活跃起来，他说，“我们的歌舞团在上海作了演出，我们的球队还进行了几次球赛。”他幽默地说，“当然这方面我们要检讨，我们的运动员不行，几乎都打输了。”
    “不是几乎都打输，而是全部都打输了。”坐在边上的海军中校笑着插了一句，切库罗夫也笑了起来！
    “对，全部都输了，不过我们输得很高兴，因为我们看见中国运动员的技术这样高明，身体也这样壮。我们的运动员回去以后一定要好好地来练习。”
    外滩海关大楼的钟噹的敲了一下，时候已是两点半钟。凉意的风从黄浦江吹到甲板上。甲板上的许多水兵们还在继续地进行打扫工作。就在最近的五天中，这甲板上曾经印过了上海一万多参观者的脚迹，它给上海和苏联访华舰队的人们留下了难忘的记忆。切库罗夫一再抱歉地说，这五天中，他们虽然接触了将近二十万上海人民，一万多人参观了舰队，但非常遗憾的是，由于时间的限制，他们不能和更多的人握手，不能和更多的上海人民接触。他诚挚地说：“请转告上海人民，感谢他们的热诚招待，并祝他们工作得好，身体健康。”
    “希望通过你们报纸，感谢给我们写信，送礼的同志，我再一次真诚地感谢他们，向他们表示崇高的敬意。愿我们在争取和平的斗争中，更好地团结在一起。”
    我们对他说：我们一定做到这一点，将切库罗夫海军中将和苏联友好访华舰队全体同志的友谊，通过报纸告诉给人民。
    “希望你们到海参崴来，海参崴的苏联人民一定将欢迎你们。”切库罗夫又一次伸出了他那有力的、暖热的手。
    当小艇载着我们到达黄浦江西岸时，大钟的时针已指向三点。天在发白了。我们不断地回望着巡洋舰的雄姿，那里友人们似乎还立在船舷边了望着我们。
