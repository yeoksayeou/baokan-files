    Cultivating Children's Love for Science and Technology
    Science and Technology Activities at the Shanghai China Welfare Institute Children's Palace
    Chen Weibao, Director of Shanghai China Welfare Institute Children's Palace

    Since the Shanghai China Welfare Institute Children's Palace began its work in the spring of 1953, science and technology activities have been one of the important aspects of the palace's work. This aspect of the work began with group activities, initially with only four groups, and now includes eleven types of groups, such as electrical engineering, radio, and aviation models. Each type of group has one to four subgroups, currently totaling twenty-one subgroups, each with fifteen to twenty-five members. They meet once a week, with middle school groups meeting for two hours each time and elementary school groups for one hour and thirty minutes. Each activity period lasts for one year. There are currently 320 group members.

    Group activities can only accommodate a small number of children. To promote science and technology to more children, we have gradually launched mass activities based on group activities. Since the second half of 1955, we have been developing mass organizations for enthusiasts. The first to be established was the Junior Aviation Model Enthusiasts Club, which already has more than 300 enthusiasts. In 1956, the Naval Vessel Model Enthusiasts Club and the Radio Enthusiasts Club will be established. The Enthusiasts Club is a relatively broad mass organization that, in addition to irregular large-scale activities, can also help participants solve specific problems at any time. In addition, the Children's Palace also helps schools carry out science and technology activities. The science and technology activities of the Shanghai China Welfare Institute Children's Palace adopt a voluntary approach to attract school children to participate. The duration of the activities is generally one school year. However, some group members have particularly high interests, and their talents are worth special cultivation. For example, some members of the radio group have already assembled five-tube radios and are now conducting research on radio control. If their activities were to end after one school year, and the school does not yet have the conditions for them to continue their research, this would limit the development of their talents. Therefore, we have adopted a method of extending the research period for individual group members. This allows us to better cultivate the creative talents of a portion of children.

    The science and technology activities of the Children's Palace are based on the children's level of knowledge to determine the content of the activities. Children's knowledge level should be basically measured by the progress of classroom learning, but children also constantly acquire knowledge from daily life. For example, there is very little knowledge about electricity in elementary school science classes, but urban children are exposed to a lot of common sense about the use of electricity in daily life. Therefore, considering the electrification prospects of the socialist construction of the motherland, cultivating children's familiarity with the application of electricity in various aspects, mastering varying degrees of electrical principles and electrical engineering techniques, and guiding them to study science more actively is in line with current educational requirements. The activities of our electrical engineering group are divided into three types according to different levels of knowledge: the elementary school group focuses on making distribution boards, traffic lights, electric bells, etc., based on electric current; the junior high school first and second grade group focuses on making electric motors and crane trucks using electric motors, based on electromagnetism; and the junior high school third grade group focuses on assembling various types of radios based on radio waves. This division is not absolute. For example, the radio group has fifteen members, eleven of whom are third-year junior high school students and four of whom are second-year junior high school students. These four students have very little electrical knowledge from their school physics classes, but they are more closely exposed to electrical common sense in their lives. Some have brothers who are radio enthusiasts, and some have friends who work in the radio industry. As a result, the electrical common sense and technical knowledge of these four second-year junior high school students actually exceeds that of the third-year students.

    The science and technology activities of the Children's Palace are different from the teaching activities in schools. In the teaching activities in schools, students are required to systematically master all the content of the teaching syllabus, while in the groups of the Children's Palace, they only study the problems that children are interested in. Therefore, the relationship between the content of the group activities of the Children's Palace and classroom teaching arises. Initially, we simply carried out activities based on the progress of textbooks, which was equivalent to attending supplementary classes, and the children's interest was not high. Later, we realized that the relationship between group activities and classroom teaching is mainly that after children study a certain aspect of the problem in depth in the group, it helps them understand all aspects of knowledge, improve their desire for knowledge, and thus more actively and proactively accept the knowledge taught in the classroom. Diao Zhengdan, a student at Guangming Middle School, felt that he could realize his ambition when he joined the aviation model group. He failed his math midterm exam at school, and he thought it didn't matter, as long as he could become a pilot in the future. However, during the activities of the aviation model group, especially after visiting pilots at the airport, he clearly realized that to become a pilot, he needed knowledge in all aspects, and that mathematics was a very important subject in aviation technology. So he studied hard and soon eliminated his math failures. Teenagers and children have a high desire for knowledge, and classroom teaching cannot fully meet these requirements, which sometimes even affects their enthusiasm for learning. In this case, the group activities of the Children's Palace become a necessary supplement to classroom teaching. Zhou Biwen, a student at Jiangning Middle School, was very interested in electricity and did some research on his own. Therefore, he asked a lot of questions when he attended physics class at school. These questions were often outside the scope of the curriculum, and the teacher could not answer them in class, because this would affect the progress of teaching. This made Zhou Biwen dissatisfied with the physics teacher, and the teacher also said that Zhou Biwen was disruptive. After he joined the science and engineering group of the Children's Palace in 1953, the situation gradually changed. He was a very good member of the group, willing to study hard and able to understand quickly. He quickly mastered the technology. When the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League wanted to select a batch of children's works as gifts to send to the Soviet Union in the spring of 1954, Zhou Biwen's small electric fan was also selected. At the same time, his classroom learning situation also improved.

    Because teenagers and children are of different ages, their interests are not exactly the same. The famous Soviet educator Makarenko said, "The real stimulus of human life is the joy of tomorrow," that is to say, a bright future is the driving force for work. But he also said, "Children should have the joy of today." The younger the child, the more eager they are to see the results of their work. If the goal is set too far, it is more difficult to maintain the child's interest. Once, an elementary school child planted castor beans, and when they did not sprout after a week, he dug them up to look at them. Our electric motor group once planned to build an automated factory in 1954. At the beginning, the group members were very interested, but the construction steps of this factory were to build the factory building first. For a whole semester, the members of the electric motor group were dealing with plywood. By the end of the semester, the factory building was not yet completed, and the members became impatient and their interest gradually declined. Later, they changed the plan and made the electric motor first. After several activities, they could see the electric motor turning, and the members' interest rose again. Therefore, the younger the child, the more the content of the activity should be able to see results quickly. As the age increases, the goals of the activity should also be gradually extended. At the same time, attention should also be paid to guiding children to gradually expand the goals and prospects they pursue. This not only depends on gradually expanding the goals of the activity plan, but also depends on the obvious social orientation of the group activity, linking the content of the group activity with industrial and agricultural production, so that children feel that they are also participating in the socialist construction of the motherland. Only in this way can the children's initiative be brought into play, and can the children be guided from the joy of today to the realization of far-reaching goals.

    The content of science and technology group activities should be diversified, not limited to simple production. The more diverse the activity methods, the more the children's initiative and enthusiasm can be brought into play, the more the children's knowledge horizon can be expanded, and the more their desire for knowledge can be inspired. Flexibility and diversity should be the characteristics of group activities. In this way, children can be guided to firmly grasp knowledge and technology from various practical lives, and link group activities with social life.

    The most important thing in the guidance method of science and technology groups is to bring into play the initiative and enthusiasm of the members. Therefore, group instructors should be good at inspiring the interest of the members and helping them to think independently. Since group activities are carried out according to the children's voluntary and interest, it is impossible to predetermine an unchangeable group syllabus, and it is impossible to require the progress of each member to be completely consistent. The instructor cannot rigidly require the members to advance in unison according to the instructor's plan, but can only give guidance separately according to different situations.

    As a group instructor, you must also be good at supporting those bold experiments, and be good at guiding children's fantasies into practical activities. Some members of the aviation model group saw a line-controlled engine airplane and wondered if a glider without an engine could also be controlled by a line? The instructor supported this idea and used the principle of centrifugal force to inspire them to conduct research. They conducted many experiments, revised the model drawings several times, and creatively improved the control stick and rudder, using a bamboo pole to extend the control radius. In this way, a line-controlled glider was successfully trial-produced, and the members gave it a name called "An Obedient Bird." This obedient bird is the product of the combination of children's enthusiasm, creative spirit and the guiding role of the instructor.

    The instructor is not a serious elder, but a long-term confidant friend of the children. In the group, children not only get scientific and technological help from the instructor, but also need to get the instructor's care and encouragement. They are often willing to pour out their hearts to the instructor. At the same time, the instructor must also become the protector of the children. In scientific and technological activities, the possibility of accidents is very high, and safety must be paid attention to at all times.

    培养儿童热爱科学技术
    上海中国福利会少年宫的科学技术活动
    上海中国福利会少年宫主任　陈维博
    上海中国福利会少年宫自从1953年春天开始工作以来，科学技术活动就是少年宫的重要工作内容之一。这一方面的工作是以小组活动开始的，最早只有四个小组，现在有电机、无线电、航空模型等十一种小组。每种小组有一到四个组，现在共有二十一个组，每组有十五到二十五人，每周活动一次，每次中学组二小时，小学组一小时三十分，每期活动期限为一年。现在共有小组组员三百二十人。
    小组活动所能容纳的儿童毕竟是少数，为了向更多的儿童进行科学技术的宣传工作，我们在小组活动的基础上逐渐开展了群众活动。从1955年下半年开始发展爱好者的群众组织，已经成立的是少年航空模型爱好者俱乐部，已经有三百多个爱好者参加。1956年内将成立舰船模型爱好者俱乐部和无线电爱好者俱乐部。爱好者俱乐部是比较广泛的群众组织，除了不定期的大活动以外，还可以随时帮助参加者解决一些具体问题。此外，少年宫也帮助学校开展了科学技术活动。上海中国福利会少年宫的科学技术活动是采取自愿的方式吸收学校中的少年儿童参加的。活动的期限一般是一学年。但是有些组员兴趣特别高，他们的才能值得特别培养，如无线电小组有几个组员已经装配了五灯收音机，现在正进行无线电操纵的研究，若是一个学年后就结束了他们的活动，而学校里还没有条件使他们继续研究，这就限制了他们的才能的发展。因此我们采取了对个别组员可以延长研究期限的方式。这样就能更好地培养一部分儿童的创造才能。
    少年宫的科学技术活动，是根据儿童的知识水平来决定活动内容的。儿童的知识水平基本上应当从课堂学习的进度来衡量，但儿童们也从日常生活中不断地取得知识。例如小学自然课中讲到电方面的知识还很少，但城市儿童在日常生活中接触很多关于用电的常识。因此，考虑到祖国社会主义建设的电气化前途，培养儿童熟悉电在各方面的应用，掌握不同程度的电学原理和电工技术，引导他们更积极地学习科学，是符合于当前的教育要求的。我们的电工小组的活动内容按照不同程度的知识水平分成三种：小学组以电流为基础制作分线板、红绿灯、电铃等；初中一、二年级组以电磁为基础制作电动机和应用电动机的起重机、电车等；初中三年级组以电波为基础装配各种类型的收音机。这样的分法也不是绝对的。如无线电小组共有十五个组员，有十一人是初三学生，四人是初二学生。这四个人在学校的物理课中掌握的电学知识还很少，但他们在生活中和电学常识接触得较密切，有的哥哥是无线电爱好者，有的朋友在无线电行工作，因而这四个初二学生的某些电学常识和技术知识反而超过初三的学生。
    少年宫的科学技术活动，和学校的教学活动不同。在学校的教学活动中要求学生系统地掌握教学大纲的全部内容，而在少年宫的小组中只是研究儿童们感到兴趣的问题。因此就产生了少年宫的小组活动内容和课堂教学的关系问题。最初我们曾单纯地根据教科书的进度搞活动，结果等于上补充课，儿童兴趣不高。后来我们体会到小组活动和课堂教学的关系主要是儿童在小组中较深刻地研究了某一方面的问题之后，有助于领会各方面的知识，提高求知欲，从而更能积极主动地接受课堂中讲授的知识。光明中学学生刁正旦参加航空模型小组的时候，觉得这一回可以实现自己的志愿了，学校期中考试时数学不及格，他想这也没有什么，只要将来能成为飞机师就行了。但是在航空模型小组的活动过程中，特别是到飞机场访问了飞机驾驶员以后，他明确认识了要想成为驾驶员需要各方面的知识，数学在航空技术上是非常重要的学问，于是他就积极学习，不久就消灭了数学不及格的现象。少年儿童的求知欲很高，课堂教学不可能完全满足这些要求，这种情况有时甚至影响了学习的积极性。在这种情况下，少年宫的小组活动就成了课堂教学的必要的补充。江宁中学学生周必文对电非常有兴趣，自己也作了些研究，因此在学校上物理课的时候提的问题特别多，这些问题往往不是课程范围内的，教师不可能在课堂上回答他这些问题，因为这样就要影响教学的进度。这样就使得周必文对物理教师不满意，而教师也说周必文捣乱。他在1953年参加少年宫的理工小组以后，情况就逐渐改变了。他在小组中是一个很好的组员，肯钻研，理解力强，很快的掌握了技术。1954年春天团中央要选一批儿童作品作为礼物送到苏联去的时候，周必文做的小电扇也中选了，同时他的课堂学习情况也改进了。
    少年儿童因为年龄不同，因此兴趣也不完全相同。著名的苏联教育家马卡连柯说：“人的生活的真正刺激是明天的快乐”，就是说，美满的远景是推动工作的动力。但是他同时也说：“对儿童要有当日的快乐”。愈是低年龄的儿童愈是急于看到工作的成绩，如果目标定得太远，就较难保持儿童的兴趣。曾经有一个小学的孩子种下蓖麻，一个星期没有出芽，他就去挖出来看。我们的电机小组在1954年曾经定过计划做一个自动化工厂，开始的时候组员们兴趣很大，但是这个工厂的建设步骤是先造厂房，整整一个学期电机组的组员们就和三夹板打交道，到学期结束的时候连厂房还没有完工，组员们就不耐烦了，兴趣逐渐低落。后来改变计划，先作电动机，几次活动就能看到电动机转动，这时组员们的兴趣就又高涨起来了。因此，愈是低年龄的儿童，活动的内容愈要能很快地看到效果，随着年龄的增长，活动的目标也要逐渐伸长。但同时，也应当注意引导儿童把追求的目标和远景逐渐扩大。这不但要靠逐渐扩大活动计划的目标，也要靠小组活动所具有的明显的社会倾向，把小组活动的内容和工农业生产联系起来，使儿童感到自己也参加了祖国社会主义建设事业。这样才能发挥儿童的主动精神，才能把儿童由当日的快乐引导到实现远大的目标上面。
    科学技术小组活动的内容要多样化，不能限于单纯的制作，活动方式愈多样，愈能发挥儿童的主动性、积极性，愈能扩大儿童的知识眼界，启发他们的求知欲。灵活性和多样性应当是小组活动的特点。这样，才能引导儿童从各种实际生活中牢固地掌握知识和技术，把小组活动和社会生活联系起来。
    对科学技术小组的指导方法，最主要的就是发挥组员的主动性、积极性。因此小组指导员要善于启发组员的兴趣，并帮助他们进行独立的思考。由于小组活动是根据儿童的自愿和兴趣来进行活动的，所以就不可能预先定出一个一成不变的小组大纲，也不可能对每个组员的进度要求完全一致。指导员不能硬性要求组员们一律按照指导员的计划齐步前进，而只能根据不同情况分别给予指导。
    作为小组指导员，还要善于支持那些大胆的实验，善于把儿童的幻想引导到实际活动中来。航空模型小组有几个组员看到线操纵引擎飞机，就想一个没有引擎的滑翔机是否也能用线操纵呢？指导员支持了这种想法，并且用离心力的道理启发他们去进行研究。他们进行了多次试验，修改了几次模型图样，还创造性地改进了操纵杆和方向舵，用一根竹竿来延长操纵半径。这样，一只用线操纵的滑翔机就试制成功了，组员们给它起了个名字叫“一只听话的鸟”。这只听话的鸟是儿童的积极性、创造精神和指导员的指导作用结合起来的产物。
    指导员不是一个严肃的长辈，而是儿童们的年长的知心朋友。儿童们在小组里不仅是从指导员那里得到科学技术上的帮助，还需要得到指导员的关心和鼓舞。他们心里的话常常愿意向指导员倾吐。同时指导员也要成为儿童们的保护者，在科学技术活动中，发生事故的可能性是很大的，必须随时注意安全。
