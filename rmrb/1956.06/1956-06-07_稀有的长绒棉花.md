    Rare Long-Staple Cotton
    Xinhua News Agency: A batch of Sea Island cotton seeds with a staple length rare in the world has been discovered successively in Kaiyuan, Yuanjiang, and Yingjiang counties in Yunnan Province. The longest fiber of this cotton reaches 55 millimeters, which is longer than the "longest" fiber discovered by British cotton expert Bower in two cotton seeds.
    This long-staple cotton is called Wenshan naked-seed cotton, a type of perennial Sea Island cotton, originally produced in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province. After being transplanted to Kaiyuan and other places, and with relatively careful cultivation, the staple length has rapidly increased. Currently, the Kaiyuan Kapok Experimental Station in Yunnan Province and the Yunnan Kapok Survey and Research Group are conducting seed selection work to increase the existing staple length.

    稀有的长绒棉花
    新华社讯　一批绒长在世界上稀有的海岛棉的种子，先后在云南省开远、元江和盈江等县发现。这种棉花的纤维最长的达到五十五公匣，比英国棉花专家鲍尔氏发现的两粒棉子具有世界上“最长”的纤维还长。
    这种长绒棉叫文山离核棉，是多年生海岛棉中的一种，原产在云南省文山专区，移植开远等地以后，经过比较精心的培植，绒长迅速增加。现在云南省开远木棉试验站和云南省木棉勘查研究组正在进行种子选育工作，以增加现有的绒长。
