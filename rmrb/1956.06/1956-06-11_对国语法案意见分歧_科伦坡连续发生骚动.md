Xinhua News Agency, Colombo: Riots occurred here on June 5th and 6th due to the language issue, resulting in hundreds of Tamil speakers being injured.

    The riots erupted during the parliamentary discussion of the government's recently proposed Official Language Act. This bill stipulates that from July 1960, Sinhala will be the sole official language of Ceylon, replacing English and Tamil.

    Tamil speakers in Ceylon oppose the bill, and they demonstrated in front of the parliament on the 5th, demanding that Tamil enjoy the same status as Sinhala. Protests against the bill also occurred in other parts of Ceylon.

    Ceylon's Prime Minister Bandaranaike stated in Parliament on the 5th that the current tense situation was caused by the conflicting promises made by former Prime Minister Kotelawala to the Tamils and Sinhalese on the language issue. He said that Kotelawala promised the Sinhalese that he would make Sinhala the sole official language, but at the same time told the Tamils that he would amend the constitution to grant Sinhala and Tamil equal status as official languages.

    The Prime Minister said that regardless of any differences of opinion that may exist on language or any other issue, he would do his utmost to ensure domestic law, order, and peace. He said he could not tolerate "hooliganism from any side."

    The ruling People's United Front in Ceylon advocates for Sinhala as the official language in its election platform, but also advocates for the protection of the right to use Tamil.

    Following the riots on the 5th, Communist Party of Ceylon Member of Parliament Keuneman demanded that Bandaranaike take strong measures against Sinhalese people attacking innocent Tamils.

    对国语法案意见分歧
    科伦坡连续发生骚动
    据新华社讯　科伦坡消息：这里在六月五日和六日由于语言问题连续发生骚动，成百的说泰米尔语的人被打伤。
    骚动是在国会讨论政府最近提出的国语法案的时候发生的。这项法案规定从1960年7月起不用英语和泰米尔语为锡兰的官方语言，而以僧伽罗语为唯一的国语。
    锡兰说泰米尔语的人反对这项法案，他们五日在国会前举行示威，要求泰米尔语也享有和僧伽罗语同等的待遇。在锡兰其他地方，也发生了抗议这项法案的示威。
    锡兰总理班达拉奈克五日在国会说：目前的紧张局势是由于前总理科特拉瓦拉当初在语言问题上向泰米尔人和僧伽罗人作了互相抵触的诺言而引起的。他说：科特拉瓦拉答应僧伽罗人他将使僧伽罗语成为唯一的国语，但是同时又告诉泰米尔人说，他将修改宪法给予僧伽罗语和泰米尔语作为国语的同等地位。
    这位总理说：无论在语言或者任何其他问题上可能存在怎样分歧的意见，他将尽最大的力量来保证国内的法律、秩序和和平。他说：他不能容忍“来自任何方面的暴徒行径”。
    目前锡兰执政的人民联合阵线在竞选纲领中主张以僧伽罗语为国语，但是同时主张保护使用泰米尔语的权利。
    在五日的骚动发生后，锡兰共产党议员克尼曼要求班达拉奈克对袭击无辜的泰米尔人的僧伽罗人采取有力的措施。
