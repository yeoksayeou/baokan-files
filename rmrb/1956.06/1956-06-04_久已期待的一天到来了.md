    The Long-Awaited Day Has Arrived
    By Our Correspondent Pei Da
    May 30th, the people of Tokyo, the capital of Japan, happily spent a long-awaited day.
    In the morning, it was raining, and the sky was filled with mist. However, this gloomy weather could not hide the joy in people's hearts. On trams and on the streets, playbills welcoming the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's performance in Japan attracted countless passengers and passersby. People couldn't help but admire the color portraits of Mei Lanfang.
    The Kabukiza Theatre, located in a prosperous area of Tokyo, was spotlessly cleaned by the continuous rain. The palace-style large roof was a deep green and looked very majestic. This nationally renowned theater was first built in 1890, and the current modern building was completed in 1926. For decades, it has been staging Japan's traditional national drama – Kabuki. It has never welcomed foreign actors to perform here, no matter how famous they are. But on this day, it displayed huge banners welcoming the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's performance. Mr. Shimoda of Asahi Shimbun said, "The Japanese people have offered the Chinese artists unparalleled glory."
    After noon, the audience rushed to the theater two hours in advance. Among the crowd were famous Japanese literary artists, well-known actors, and university professors, elderly ladies with white hair, and people who had queued up that day to buy standing tickets.
    At 5:30, the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan held its opening ceremony. Mr. Shiraishi Iwao, representing Asahi Shimbun, said in his speech: "We have been waiting for you as if a day seems like three seasons, for seven months already. Today, a great troupe composed of China's first-class actors is performing here, which makes us feel very excited." The audience responded with warm applause. Then, the first deputy leader of the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan expressed his regards to the audience on behalf of the entire delegation and conveyed the warm greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to the Japanese people. Thunderous applause rang out throughout the venue once again.
    The opening gong and drum sounded, and the theater was instantly silent. Nearly three thousand audience members focused their joyful gaze on the stage. "If you look at the expressions of the audience, you can understand the Japanese people's love for Peking Opera," as the famous Japanese actor Ichikawa Ennosuke said at the welcoming reception on the 29th, was confirmed here. The singing in "The Reconciliation of the General and the Minister," the graceful dance in "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," and the astonishing dark fight in "The Crossroads," each moment captivated the audience. People listened attentively and quietly, and sometimes their eyebrows danced with joy, following the changes in the plot. When they saw the wonderful martial arts performances, exclamations, laughter, and cheers followed one after another. At the end of each performance, the Chinese Peking Opera actors repeatedly took bows amidst enthusiastic applause. There was originally no custom of taking bows in Japan, and this broke another Japanese convention.
    Even before Mei Lanfang took the stage, the Chinese Peking Opera art had already caused a sensation in the entire venue. During the short break, people praised the wonderful performances of the Peking Opera actors. Professor Okuno Shintaro of Keio University, a researcher of Chinese literature and art, said: "Compared to the old Peking Opera, this performance gives a very novel feeling. The actors' movements and music have been modernized, with not only the art of listening but also the art of watching. It's a great success! It cannot be denied that Peking Opera artists have world-class standards." Those who were watching Peking Opera for the first time praised it even more.
    In this joyful moment, tens of thousands of people in Tokyo watched the Peking Opera performance on television. Mr. Matsumoto Ken, an employee of a certain company who had not been able to buy a ticket, fulfilled his wish on this evening. Although he could not see the gorgeous stage colors, he saw the artistic performance of Peking Opera and was infinitely excited. Oshima Sumiri, a third-year student in the English Department of Tsuda College, presented flowers to the head of the Chinese Trade Delegation, Lei Renmin, when they came to Japan last year, which was the first time she had welcomed Chinese people. This time, she had long prepared to use the money she earned from her spare-time work to buy Peking Opera tickets, but she couldn't get them. On this evening, because both the school and the dormitory lacked television equipment, she did not see the Peking Opera performance either. With a feeling of great regret, she fantasized about getting the opportunity to appreciate Peking Opera when the Peking Opera Delegation performed in various places and then came to Tokyo again.
    At about 9 p.m., China's most famous Peking Opera artist, Mei Lanfang, who was well-known to the Japanese people, appeared on the gorgeous stage amidst warm applause. The entire audience was visibly delighted and felt great interest in every movement of Mei Lanfang. The audience inside and outside the theater were intoxicated by Yang Guifei's clear singing and graceful dance after she was drunk. As Mr. Shiraishi Iwao, representing Asahi Shimbun, said, through the Chinese Peking Opera art, "the hearts of the Chinese and Japanese people are connected together." At the end of the play, applause rang out throughout the venue, and bouquets of flowers were presented to the head of the delegation, Mei Lanfang, and other Peking Opera actors. In this joyous moment, the shadows of hydrogen bomb tests and atomic rain were swept away from people's minds. "Sino-Japanese cultural exchange is a kind of artistic diplomacy, and the effect it produces cannot be achieved by airplanes and cannons," said the chairman of the Japanese Shochiku Film Company at the welcoming reception on the 29th, which was powerfully proven here.

    久已期待的一天到来了
    本报记者　裴达
    五月三十日，日本首都——东京的人们满心高兴地度过了久已期待的一天。
    早晨，雨在下着，满天雾气茫茫。但是，这阴沉的天气也掩盖不住人们的喜悦心情。在电车上，在街头，欢迎中国京剧代表团来日演出的戏报，吸引着无数的乘客和过往行人。人们情不自禁地对着梅兰芳的彩色剧照，发出了赞叹的声音。
    座落在东京繁华地区的歌舞伎座大戏院，被连日细雨洗刷得一尘不染。那宫殿式的大屋顶一片浓绿，显得非常雄伟。这座驰名全国的大剧院初建在1890年，现今的现代化建筑是在1926年竣工的。几十年来，这里一直上演着日本传统的民族戏剧——歌舞伎，它从来不欢迎外国的演员在这里演戏，不管他是多末有名的艺术家。但是，这一天它张起了欢迎中国京剧团演出的巨幅标语。朝日新闻社的下田先生说：“日本人民向中国艺术家献出了无尚的光荣。”
    中午过后，观众提前两小时就向剧院涌进。人群之中，有日本著名文学艺术家、有名演员和大学教授，有白发苍苍的老太太，还有在当天排队买到站票的人们。
    五时半，中国访日京剧代表团举行开幕式。朝日新闻社代表白石嵓先生致词说：“我们一日三秋似地等待着你们，已经等了七个月了。今天以中国第一流演员组成的伟大的剧团在这里演出，使我们感到非常兴奋。”台下观众报以热烈的掌声。接着，中国访日京剧代表团第一副团长代表全团向观众致意，并向日本人民转达中国人民的热烈问候和最好的愿望。全场再一次响起了雷动般的掌声。
    开台锣鼓打响了，剧场内顷时鸦雀无声。近三千名观众的喜悦的目光都集中在舞台上。“如果你看看观众的眼色，就能体会日本人民爱好京剧的心情。”——日本名演员市川猿之助在二十九日欢迎会所说的话，在这里得到证实。“将相和”的歌声，“拾玉镯”的优美舞蹈，“三岔口”的惊人暗斗，每一时刻都吸引着观众。人们随着剧情的变化，有时凝神静听，有时眉飞色舞。看到绝妙的武打时，惊叹声、笑声、喝采声接连不断。每场演出终了，中国京剧演员都在热烈掌声中再三谢幕。本来在日本没有谢幕的习惯，这又打破了日本的一个惯例。
    梅兰芳还未登场，中国京剧艺术就轰动了全场。人们在短短的休憩时间，纷纷赞扬京剧演员的精彩表演。庆应大学教授、中国文艺研究家奥野信太郎说：“比起古时候京剧，看这次演出有了非常新颖的感觉。演员的动作、音乐都达到近代化，不仅有听的艺术，而且有看的艺术。太成功了！京剧艺术家有世界水平是不能否认的。”至于第一次看京剧的人更是极口称赞。
    在这欢腾的时刻，东京数十万人从电视里看到了京剧演出。没有买到戏票的某公司职员松本谦这一天晚上实现了自己的愿望。他虽然看不到华丽的舞台色彩，但是看到了京剧的艺术表演，心中无限兴奋。津田英语学校大学部三年级女生大岛纯里，在去年中国贸易代表团来日本的时候，曾经向雷任民团长献过花，那是她第一次接迎中国人。这次她早就准备着用课余劳动所得来买京剧票，但是没有买到。这一天晚上，因为学校和宿舍都缺乏电视设备，也没有看到京剧演出。她怀着非常遗憾的心情，幻想着京剧代表团在各地演出后再到东京时，能得到欣赏京剧的机会。
    晚九时许，为日本人民所熟知的中国最著名京剧艺术家梅兰芳，在热烈掌声中出现在艳丽的舞台上。全体观众喜形于外，对梅兰芳的每一个动作都感到莫大兴趣。剧院内外的观众都陶醉在杨贵妃酒醉后的清歌妙舞之中了。正如朝日新闻社代表白石嵓先生所说，通过中国的京剧艺术，“中日两国人民的心连结在一起了。”剧终，全场掌声四起，一束接着一束的鲜花献给梅兰芳团长和其他京剧演员。在这欢乐的时刻，什么氢弹试验、原子雨的阴影，都从人们的心灵上一扫而空。“中日文化交流是一种艺术外交，它所产生的效果是飞机大炮所不能得到的。”日本松竹电影社董事长在二十九日欢迎会上讲的话，在这里得到了有力的证明。
