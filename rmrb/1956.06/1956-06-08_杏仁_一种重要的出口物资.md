    Almonds
    An Important Export Commodity
    Wu Changquan, Gong Jinghai

    Sweet and bitter almonds are an important export commodity for our country. The production areas are all over the country, with large yields, broad sales abroad, and high value. Exporting one ton of bitter almonds can be exchanged for six tons of steel or fifteen tons of fertilizer; farmers can buy one and a half chi of white fine cloth or one and a half jin of flour by selling one jin of bitter almonds, and buy a bamboo thermos bottle by selling seven jin of bitter almonds.

    This year, the growth of apricots in various places is very good, and almonds will be on the market one after another recently. However, in the main almond-producing areas, the purchasing units' plans have not yet been distributed to the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, nor have they been linked with agricultural production cooperatives. Farmers still do not know whether this year's purchase price is high or low. The labor force of agricultural production cooperatives is uniformly allocated. If they are not linked with agricultural production cooperatives in time now and arranged in advance, it will directly affect the yield and purchase volume of almonds. Therefore, the purchasing departments in various places must quickly link up with agricultural production cooperatives and tell the farmers the purchase price as soon as possible. The purchase price should be set fairly and reasonably so that neither the farmers nor the state suffers. The almond purchase work should not be afraid of trouble or dislike the small quantity. It is necessary to achieve purchase to the household, not too much for hundreds of jin, and not too little for four liang. At the same time, farmers should also be educated not to pick and sell green apricots, so as not to affect the quality of almonds.

    In the city, people eat apricots and throw away the apricot kernels. If this part of the almonds is collected, the quantity is also considerable. It is recommended that state-owned retail companies and cooperatives organize fruit vendors to exchange apricots for apricot kernels when selling apricots, so as to recover lost almonds. In addition, collecting almonds can also be included in the children's small five-year plan, using spare time to collect apricot kernels and sell them to the state, which is also a good way to increase export sources.

    杏仁
    一种重要的出口物资
    吴昌权　宫镜海
    甜、苦杏仁是我国出口的一项重要商品，产区遍及全国，产量大，国外销路广，价值高。出口一吨苦杏仁可以换回六吨钢材或十五吨肥田粉；农民卖掉一斤苦杏仁就可以买回一尺五福白细布或是一斤半面粉，卖七斤苦杏仁就可以买一个竹皮暖水瓶。
    今年各地杏子生长情况都很好，杏仁最近就要陆续上市了。但是在杏仁的主要产区，收购单位的计划还没有下达到基层供销合作社，没同农业生产合作社挂上钩，农民对今年的收购价格是高是低也还不知道。农业生产合作社的劳动力是统一调配的，如果现在不及时和农业生产合作社挂上钩、事先安排好，将会直接影响到杏仁的产量和收购量。因此，各地收购部门要赶紧同农业生产合作社挂好钩，把收购价格早些告诉农民。收购价格要订得公平合理，使农民和国家都不吃亏。对杏仁的收购工作不能怕麻烦、嫌数量零星，要做到收购到户，百斤不嫌多、四两不嫌少，同时也要教育农民不要摘卖青杏，以免影响杏仁质量。
    在城市里人们吃了杏子，就把杏核扔了，如果把这一部分杏仁收集起来，数量也是相当可观的。建议国营零售公司、合作社组织水果商贩在卖杏的时候，采取以杏核换杏的办法，回收散失的杏仁。此外，还可以把收集杏仁订在儿童的小五年计划内，利用课余时间收集杏核卖给国家，这也是增加出口货源的好办法。
