Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 10th: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: The Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed in the South Korean ports of Incheon, Busan, and Gunsan have all temporarily withdrawn to the Panmunjom Headquarters on June 9th.

    On June 8th, the US side unilaterally notified the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams should cease work on June 9th and withdraw to the Panmunjom Headquarters on the same day. On the evening of the same day, at 8:00 PM, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission convened a special meeting regarding this illegal notification from the US side. The meeting, considering the difficulties caused by the high-handed actions of the US side, passed instructions to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at the ports in both North and South Korea. It is reported that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's instructions directed the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed in Sinuiju, Manpo, and Sinanju in North Korea and Incheon, Busan, and Gunsan in South Korea to cease all duties of supervision, observation, inspection, and investigation from 00:01 (local time) on June 9, 1956, and to return to the Panmunjom Headquarters as soon as possible with all materials. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's special meeting also passed identical letters to both sides of the Military Armistice Commission.

    It is reported that relevant personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission expressed indignation at this high-handed measure by the US side. Swiss member Minister Real expressed surprise and dissatisfaction with the US side's causing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw its teams in such a short period, and advocated that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission could express this dissatisfaction through a resolution. Swedish member General Bergenstrale also believed that the deadline notified by the US side was too short. Czechoslovakian Acting Member Colonel Reinal protested against the US side's actions.

    Swiss member Minister Real also said that he believed the attitude taken by the US side towards this organization established under the Armistice Agreement was extremely rude, especially since the US side had also indicated that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission would not be dissolved at present, but would at least continue to work at the Panmunjom Headquarters, thus making this attitude even more rude.

    Polish member Minister Morski expressed anger at the US side's issuing such a designated-deadline notification, and at the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's special meeting, he suggested adopting the Swiss member's earlier statement as a resolution.

    中立国监察委员会人员
    不满美方的横暴措施
    新华社平壤10日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：驻在南朝鲜的仁川、釜山和群山这三个口岸的中立国视察小组已经在六月九日全部暂时撤回到板门店本部。
    六月八日，美方片面通知中立国监察委员会，要中立国视察小组在六月九日停止工作，并且在当天撤回板门店本部。当天晚上八时，中立国监察委员会就美方这项非法通知召开了特别会议。会议考虑到由于美方的横暴的行动所造成的困难，通过了给驻在朝鲜南北各口岸的中立国视察小组的指示。据悉：中立国监察委员会的这个指示要驻在朝鲜北部新义州、满浦、新安州和朝鲜南部仁川、釜山和群山的中立国视察小组从1956年6月9日零时一分
  （当地时间）起停止监督、观察、视察和调查的一切职司，并且携带全部资料尽速回到板门店本部。中立国监察委员会特别会议同时还通过了给军事停战委员会双方的内容相同的信件。
    据悉：中立国监察委员会的有关人员对美方这种横暴措施表示愤慨。瑞士委员雷阿尔公使对美方使中立国监察委员会在短促的时间内撤退它的小组一事表示惊讶和不满，并且主张中立国监察委员会可以通过表示这种不满的决议。瑞典委员贝根斯特拉勒将军也认为美方所通知的期限太短促了。捷克斯洛伐克代理委员雷纳尔上校对美方的行动表示抗议。
    瑞士委员雷阿尔公使还说，他认为美方对这个根据停战协定建立的机构所采取的态度是极其无礼的，尤其是美方也曾经表示中立国监察委员会现在并不解散，而是至少要在板门店本部继续工作，因此这种态度就更加无礼。
    波兰委员莫尔斯基公使对美方发出这种指定期限的通知表示愤怒，他在中立国监察委员会特别会议上建议通过瑞士委员刚才的发言作为决议案。
