Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 21st. The Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China conducted trials of eight Japanese war criminals, including Suzuki Keiku, in Shenyang from June 9th to 19th, for their war crimes during the Japanese invasion of China.

The eight Japanese war criminals are: Suzuki Keiku, former Lieutenant General and Commander of the 117th Division of the Japanese Army; Fujita Shigeru, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 59th Division; Uesaka Katsu, Major General and Commander of the 53rd Brigade of the 59th Division; Sasaki Sannosuke, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 39th Division; Nagashima Tsutomu, Major General and Commander of the 54th Brigade of the 59th Division and concurrently Commander of the Jinan Defense Force; Funaki Kenjiro, Colonel and Commander of the 375th Regiment of the 137th Division; Sakakibara Hidefu, Major and Commander of the 162nd Detachment of the former Japanese Kwantung Army Unit 731; and Tsuno Shintaro, Lieutenant and Prisoner of War Supervision Officer and concurrently Intelligence and Propaganda Director of the 232nd Regiment Headquarters of the 39th Division.

The Presiding Judge of the Special Military Tribunal was Major General Yuan Guang, and the Judges were Zhang Xiangqian and Senior Colonel Niu Budong. The Chief Prosecutor representing the state prosecution was Major General Wang Zhiping, and the Prosecutors were Quan Weicai, Senior Colonel Tian Zhihong, and Wang Baoqi.

The defendants were represented by lawyers Xu Ping, Wang Minqiu, Sun Pu, Deng Yi, and Han Fenglu.

Representatives from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from Beijing, representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, representatives from factories, schools, and government organizations in Shenyang, and many journalists attended the trial.

Five days before the formal trial, the court delivered copies of the indictment along with Japanese translations to each defendant, and the defense lawyers met with the defendants.

At 8:30 AM on the 9th, Presiding Judge General Yuan Guang announced the official opening of the court. The Presiding Judge said to the defendants: "During the trial, you may question witnesses and expert witnesses. In addition to the defense provided by your lawyers, you may also defend yourselves. Furthermore, you have the right to make a final statement."

Following this, the Presiding Judge invited the Chief Prosecutor representing the state prosecution, General Wang Zhiping, to read the indictment.

From the afternoon of the 9th to the afternoon of the 13th, the court investigated the criminal facts of the defendants. Faced with conclusive evidence and witness testimonies, all eight defendants confessed their guilt in court.

The court investigation confirmed that defendants Suzuki Keiku, Fujita Shigeru, Uesaka Katsu, Sasaki Sannosuke, and Nagashima Tsutomu, as resolute executors of the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China, had committed serious war crimes by openly violating international law and humanitarian principles during the war.

The court first questioned Suzuki Keiku. It was confirmed that Suzuki Keiku, while commanding his troops in the Jidong area of Hebei Province and Junxian County in Henan Province from December 1941 to October 1944, committed six massacres of peaceful residents during brutal "mopping-up" and "punitive" operations.

In October 1942, the defendant, in order to implement the "Three Alls Policy" (Kill all, burn all, loot all), issued an order to his 1st Regiment and Cavalry Unit to "thoroughly purge Panjiadaizhuang." They collectively massacred over 1,280 peaceful residents in Panjiadaizhuang and burned down over 1,000 houses.

Witness Zhou Shuen, a 44-year-old farmer, was a survivor who escaped from the mass burial pit in the Panjiadaizhuang massacre and still bears scars. He testified in court, detailing the circumstances of the collective massacre carried out by Suzuki's troops in Panjiadaizhuang on the morning of October 28, 1942, and recounted how six of his twelve family members were killed. The village's grain and livestock were completely looted.

Defendant Suzuki Keiku listened with his head lowered to the witness's testimony and said: "This is completely true. I sincerely apologize."

Suzuki Keiku's various crimes were confirmed by 181 statements of accusation from victims and relatives of victims, 45 witness testimonies, 89 inquiry records, one investigation report, and 38 photographs. The court continued to question the defendants Fujita Shigeru, Uesaka Katsu, Sasaki Sannosuke, Nagashima Tsutomu, Funaki Kenjiro, and other five former commanders of the Japanese Army. It was confirmed that these defendants had, in some cases, ordered their troops to massacre peaceful residents, creating shocking tragedies; some had ordered their troops to plunder large quantities of grain and property from peaceful residents; some had ordered their troops to kill our captured personnel; some had ordered their subordinates to use our people as "live targets" for bayonet practice for new recruits; and some had ordered their troops to use our people as "mine-clearing tools" on the battlefield. Defendant Funaki Kenjiro openly violated international law and humanitarian principles. In addition to commanding and ordering his troops to massacre Chinese peaceful residents, he also ordered his troops to release poison gas in Dujiazhuang, Wanping County, Hebei Province, in September 1941, poisoning over 400 peaceful residents.

The court hearing confirmed that defendant Tsuno Shintaro, during his participation in the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China, committed heinous acts in violation of international law and humanitarian principles, including the killing of 33 peaceful residents and captured personnel, and the abuse of captured personnel in every possible way.

Finally, the court investigated the criminal facts of Sakakibara Hidefu, Major and Commander of the 162nd Detachment of the former Japanese Kwantung Army Unit 731. From November 1942 to August 1945, the defendant Sakakibara Hidefu, in violation of international law and humanitarian principles, personally led his subordinates in cultivating bacteria and manufacturing bacteriological weapons in Heilongjiang Province, China, and engaged in activities to prepare for bacteriological warfare. In experimenting with the effectiveness of bacteria on living people, he killed four peaceful residents.

The court adjourned for one day on the 14th, and the debate began on the morning of the 15th. Prosecutor Quan Weicai pointed out: The court investigation has fully confirmed the criminal facts of the defendants as accused in the indictment. Although the various crimes of the defendants are only a small part of the heinous crimes committed by Japanese imperialism in its invasion of our country, they have already brought extremely serious disasters to our people. The defendants in this case must be given the punishment they deserve. Their punishment will also serve as a solemn warning to all aggressors who attempt to follow the shameful path of Japanese imperialism again.

Next, lawyer Xu Ping defended the defendants Suzuki Keiku, Fujita Shigeru, and Sasaki Sannosuke, saying that although they were high-ranking commanders of the Japanese Army, their major actions had to be directed by the supreme commander in the field. Lawyer Xu Ping also provided some information about the defendants' awareness of the seriousness of their crimes and their expressions of bowing their heads and admitting their guilt to the Chinese people, as factors for the court to consider when sentencing the defendants. He requested the court to be lenient with the defendants.

Lawyers Wang Minqiu and Sun Pu defended Uesaka Katsu, Nagashima Tsutomu, and Funaki Kenjiro.

Lawyer Han Fenglu defended Sakakibara Hidefu.

Lawyer Deng Yi defended the defendant Tsuno Shintaro.

After the defense lawyers made their defenses, the prosecutors raised different opinions on certain issues in the defense statements. The defense lawyers then expressed their opinions. Only when both the prosecutors and the defense lawyers said that they had no further comments to make did the Presiding Judge announce the end of the debate.

The court then listened to the defendants' final statements.

Suzuki Keiku stated: "Initially, I attempted to conceal my brutal acts, but I was inspired by the humanitarian treatment I received from the Chinese people, which prompted me to reflect and recognize the crimes I had committed. Based on my crimes, I originally had no room for defense in court, but the court appointed a defense lawyer for me and informed me of my rights in court. I thank the Chinese people, and I sincerely apologize."

Fujita Shigeru said: "I now realize that the brutal war of aggression against China has not only committed heinous crimes against the Chinese people but has also brought unprecedented disasters to the Japanese people. Today, through the court that represents the will of 600 million Chinese people, I express my determination to correct my past mistakes to the Chinese people, especially the victims, and sincerely accept the court's judgment."

Defendants Uesaka Katsu, Sasaki Sannosuke, Nagashima Tsutomu, Funaki Kenjiro, Sakakibara Hidefu, and Tsuno Shintaro also expressed their remorse for their crimes and their willingness to sincerely accept the court's just judgment. Nagashima Tsutomu said: "My crimes are facts that have already been written in history, and I take full responsibility for these crimes. Please give me the punishment I deserve." Sakakibara Hidefu said: "My crime of manufacturing bacteriological weapons in preparation for bacteriological warfare blatantly tramples on the sacred conventions of the people of the world and violates humanitarian principles. I am willing to be severely punished by the court." He also said: "I think the punishment the court gives me can also serve as a warning so that those imperialists will never dare to use weapons of mass destruction again. In the painful process of repentance, I have come to realize the hatred of war. As long as my life exists for one day, I will move forward on the road of opposing war and striving for peace."

After listening to the defendants' final statements, the court adjourned to deliberate. After deliberations on the 16th, 17th, and 18th, the court convened on the morning of the 19th at 8:30 AM to pronounce the verdict, reading out the judgment of the Special Military Tribunal. The Special Military Tribunal sentenced Suzuki Keiku to 20 years in prison, Fujita Shigeru and Uesaka Katsu to 18 years each, Sasaki Sannosuke and Nagashima Tsutomu to 16 years each, Funaki Kenjiro to 14 years in prison, and Tsuno Shintaro and Sakakibara Hidefu to 13 years each. The terms of imprisonment for each defendant are calculated from the date of the judgment, and the number of days of detention before the judgment is deducted from the imprisonment term at a rate of one day for one day.

    最高人民法院特别军事法庭   
    在沈阳审判八名日本战争犯罪分子
    新华社沈阳21日电　中华人民共和国最高人民法院特别军事法庭于六月九日到十九日在沈阳对日本侵略中国战争中战争犯罪分子铃木启久等八人进行了审判。
    这八名日本战争犯罪分子是：前日本陆军第一一七师团中将师团长铃木启久、第五九师团中将师团长藤田茂、第五九师团第五三旅团少将旅团长上坂胜、第三九师团中将师团长佐佐真之助、第五九师团第五四旅团少将旅团长兼济南防卫司令官长岛勤、第一三七师团第三七五联队大佐联队长船木健次郎、前日本关东军第七三一部队第一六二支队少佐支队长榊原秀夫和第三九师团第二三二联队本部中尉俘虏监督军官兼情报宣抚主任?野晋太郎。
    特别军事法庭的审判长是军法少将袁光，审判员是张向前和军法上校牛步东。国家检察机关出席法庭的首席检察员是军法少将王之平，检察员是权维才、军法上校田志洪、王宝祺。
    律师徐平、王敏求、孙仆、邓毅、韩凤路是被告人的辩护人。
    到庭旁听的有从北京来的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的代表、各民主党派和各人民团体的代表，沈阳市工厂、学校和机关的代表，以及许多新闻记者。
    正式开庭前五天，法庭将起诉书副本连同日文译本送达各被告人，辩护人并会见了被告人。
    九日上午八时三十分，审判长袁光将军宣布正式开庭。审判长向被告人说：“你们在庭审过程中可以向证人和鉴定人发问，除辩护人为你们辩护外，你们还可以自己辩护，另外你们还有最后陈述的权利。”
    接着，审判长请国家公诉人首席检察员王之平将军宣读了起诉书。
    从九日下午到十三日下午法庭对被告人的犯罪事实进行了调查。在确凿的证据和证人的证词面前，八名被告人都当庭服罪。
    庭审调查证实了被告人铃木启久、藤田茂、上坂胜、佐佐真之助、长岛勤等五人坚决执行日本帝国主义对中国的侵略战争，在战争中公然违背国际法准则和人道原则，都是犯有严重罪行的战争犯罪分子。
    法庭首先审问了铃木启久。证实铃木启久指挥所属部队在1941年12月到1944年10月，在河北省冀东地区和河南省浚县等地进行残酷“扫荡”和“讨伐”时，制造了六起集体屠杀和平居民的罪行。
    1942年10月，被告人为了执行“三光政策”，曾向所属第一联队和骑兵队下过“彻底肃正潘家戴庄”的命令。在潘家戴庄集体屠杀了一千二百八十多名和平居民，烧毁民房一千多间。
    证人周树恩是位四十四岁的农民，他是在潘家戴庄集体屠杀中从埋人的坑里逃出来的受害人，至今身上还有伤痕。他在法庭上作证，详细叙述了1942年10月28日早晨，铃木部队在潘家戴庄进行集体屠杀的情况，并诉说他的一家十二口人，被杀害了六口。村中粮食牲畜被抢劫一空。
      被告人铃木启久低着头听完了证人的证词后说：“这完全是事实，我诚恳地谢罪。”
      铃木启久所犯的各项罪行，为被害人和被害人亲属的控诉书一百八十一件、证人的证词四十五件、查讯笔录八十九件、调查报告一件、照片三十八张等证据所证实。法庭继续审问了被告人藤田茂、上坂胜、佐佐真之助、长岛勤、船木健次郎等五名前日本陆军的指挥官。证实这些被告人，有的命令所属部队残杀和平居民，制造了骇人听闻的惨案；有的命令部队大量掠夺和平居民的粮食和财物；有的命令所属部队杀害我被俘人员；有的命令部下把我人民当作训练新兵刺杀的“活靶”；有的命令所属部队把我国人民作为战场上的“扫雷工具”。被告人船木健次郎公然违反国际法准则和人道原则，除指挥命令所属部队残杀中国和平居民外，还曾经在1941年9月在河北省宛平县杜家庄命令所属部队施放毒气，使和平居民四百余人中毒。
    庭审证实了被告人?野晋太郎在参加日本帝国主义侵略中国的战争期间，犯有违反国际法准则和人道原则，杀害三十三名和平居民和被俘人员以及对被俘人员百般虐待等罪恶事实。
    最后，法庭调查了前日本关东军第七三一部队第一六二支队少佐支队长榊原秀夫的犯罪事实。1942年11月至1945年8月，被告人榊原秀夫违反国际法准则和人道原则，亲自领导部下在中国黑龙江省培养细菌和制造细菌武器，从事准备细菌战的活动。在用活人试验细菌效能的时候，杀害了和平居民四人。
    十四日休庭一天，十五日上午开始辩论。检察员权维才指出：庭审调查已经完全证实了起诉书中所控诉的被告人的犯罪事实，虽然被告人的种种罪行仅是日本帝国主义侵略我国所犯滔天罪行的一小部分，就此已经给我国人民带来了极为严重的灾难。对于本案各被告人必须给以应得的惩罚。对他们的惩罚，同时也将是对于一切妄图再走日本帝国主义可耻道路的侵略分子一个严正的警告。
    接着，律师徐平为被告人铃本启久、藤田茂和佐佐真之助辩护说，他们虽是日本陆军的高级指挥官，但他们的重大行动必须受战地最高司令官的指挥。徐平律师还提供了一些有关被告人认识到罪恶的严重性和向中国人民低头认罪等表现的情况，作为法庭对被告人量刑时考虑的因素。他请求法庭对各被告人从宽处理。
    律师王敏求、孙仆为上坂胜、长岛勤、船木健次郎作辩护。
    律师韩凤路为榊原秀夫辩护。
    律师邓毅为被告人?野晋太郎作了辩护。
    在辩护人进行辩护以后，公诉人就辩护词中的某些问题提出了不同的意见，辩护人又发表了意见，直到公诉人和辩护人都说没有意见需要再陈述时，审判长才宣布辩论结束。
    法庭接着听取被告人最后陈述意见。
    铃木启久陈述意见说：“对自己的残暴行为，起初曾企图隐瞒，但在中国人民对我人道主义待遇的感召下，启发我进行了反省，认识了自己犯下的罪行。根据我的罪行，我在法庭上本无辩护的余地，但是，法庭给我指定了辩护人，还告诉了我在法庭上的权利，我感谢中国人民，我诚恳地谢罪。”
    藤田茂说：“我现在认识到：对中国进行的残暴的侵略战争，不仅对中国人民犯下了滔天的罪行，同时，也给日本人民带来了空前的灾难。今天，通过代表六亿中国人民意志的法庭，向中国人民特别是被害者们表示痛改前非，真诚接受法庭的裁判。”
    被告人上坂胜、佐佐真之助、长岛勤、船木健次郎、榊原秀夫和?野晋太郎也都对他们的罪行表示了忏悔，愿诚恳接受法庭的正义裁判。长岛勤说：“我的罪行是已经写在历史上的事实，对这罪行我负全部责任，请法庭给我应得的惩处。”榊原秀夫说：“我制造细菌武器准备进行细菌战的罪行，公然践踏了世界人民神圣的公约，违反了人道主义原则，愿受法庭严重处罚。”他又说：“法庭给我的处分，我想也可以作为一个警告，使那些帝国主义分子们再不敢使用大规模杀人的武器。我在悔罪的痛苦过程中，已经认识到战争的可恨。只要我的生命能够存在一天，我就向反对战争、争取和平的道路前进。”
    法庭在听完被告人的最后陈述后，退庭进行评议。经过十六、十七、十八三天的评议以后，在十九日上午八时三十分开庭宣判，宣读了特别军事法庭的判决书。特别军事法庭判处铃木启久徒刑二十年，藤田茂、上坂胜徒刑各十八年，佐佐真之助、长岛勤徒刑各十六年，船木健次郎徒刑十四年。?野晋太郎、榊原秀夫徒刑各十三年。各被告人的刑期，自判决之日起算，判决前关押的日数，以一日抵徒刑一日。
