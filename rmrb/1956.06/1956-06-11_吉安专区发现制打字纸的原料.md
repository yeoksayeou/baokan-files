    Jian Special District Discovers Raw Material for Making Typing Paper
    (Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch) Various counties in the Jian Special District of Jiangxi Province have recently discovered the raw material for making typing paper – mountain cotton bark. The total reserves in the district are abundant, with an annual output of over 300,000 jin. The largest quantities are found in Yongxin, Taihe, Suichuan, Lianhua, Ninggang, and other counties. In order to develop the diversified operations of agricultural production cooperatives and to support typing paper factories in mass-producing typing paper, farmers will be mobilized this year to collect and peel the bark in large quantities. Recently, a working group organized by the supply and marketing cooperatives and wax paper factory's technical cadres has been focusing on going deep into Yongxin County to impart the collection and peeling techniques. The farmers were all delighted and encouraged to hear that mountain cotton bark is an industrial raw material and will be collected in large quantities.

    吉安专区发现制打字纸的原料
    本报南昌讯　江西省吉安专区各县最近发现制造打字纸的原料——山棉皮，全区蕴藏量很多，年产量可达三十万斤以上。最多的是永新、泰和、遂川、莲花、宁冈等县。为了发展农业生产合作社的多种经营和支援打字纸厂大量生产打字纸，今年将发动农民群众大量采剥。最近由供销合作社和蜡纸厂的技术干部组织工作组，重点深入永新县传授采剥技术。农民们听到山棉皮是工业原料、将大量采剥后，无不欢欣鼓舞。
