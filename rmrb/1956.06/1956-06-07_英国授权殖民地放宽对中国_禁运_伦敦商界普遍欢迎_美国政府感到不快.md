    Xinhua News Agency, June 5th dispatch from London: A British Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday that Britain has authorized the governments of all its colonies to allow them to issue export licenses to applicants in order to ship goods that have been prohibited from being shipped to China but can be exported to the Soviet Union.
    The spokesman made this statement when talking about the governments of Malaya and Singapore lifting the ban on the export of rubber to China. He also said that when considering export license applications, colonial governments can freely exercise their judgment within "appropriate" limits without specifically consulting with London.
    According to Reuters, Britain is currently using "exception procedures" to increase Commonwealth exports after failing to win U.S. approval to revise the embargo policy. According to the provisions of the "exception procedure," any country participating in the "Coordinating Committee" "may allow the export of some prohibited goods when it believes that doing so is in line with its extremely important national interests."
    Reuters also reported: Rubber is not the only commodity that will be affected by Britain's new measures. British officials explained that other commodities "embargoed" for China but not for the Soviet Union may also be affected.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 5th dispatch: The news that Britain has allowed its colonies to relax the trade embargo on China has aroused different reactions in Washington and London.
    According to an Associated Press reporter in Washington, U.S. government officials "feel unhappy" about Britain's decision.
    But in London, according to Agence France-Presse reporter Bellamy, people believe that Britain's decision means that the trade "embargo" has begun to "disintegrate." He said: People in London engaged in trade with China expect that other member states of the "Coordinating Committee" that presides over the embargo may soon follow Britain's example.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th dispatch: London newspapers reported that business people in Britain generally welcome allowing Malaya to export rubber to China. Newspapers published commentaries expressing their appreciation for this matter, and some newspapers also hoped to lift the embargo on other goods.
    The Labor Party's "Daily Herald" believes: "The entire embargo is meaningless." The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" mentioned that Ceylon had long been selling rubber to China, and it said: "The embargo is considered absurd."
    The Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" editorial said: "Relaxing Malaya's ban on rubber exports to Communist China is a wise move... This embargo is largely ineffective. Maintaining the embargo is to respect the opinion of the U.S. Congress, rather than out of any legitimate strategic interests."
    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th dispatch from Washington: The U.S. State Department refused to immediately comment on Britain's permission for Malaya and other places to export rubber to China. However, according to United Press reporter Wolsd, the U.S. government is very worried.
    Wolsd said: "From the government's point of view, the trap lies here: since Britain has taken the lead in expanding trade with Communist China, other countries will be encouraged to take the same action. If too many exceptions are tolerated in the embargo list, then these exceptions will no longer be exceptions, and this control (referring to the trade 'embargo') will soon become nominal."
    U.S. Democratic Senator Jackson said yesterday: "What Britain has done is open the floodgates of trade with Communist China, which is a very regrettable situation."
    Republican Senator Mont also attacked Britain, believing that doing so was a "terrible mistake."

### 英国授权殖民地放宽对中国“禁运”  伦敦商界普遍欢迎　美国政府感到不快

    英国授权殖民地放宽对中国“禁运”
    伦敦商界普遍欢迎　美国政府感到不快
    据新华社5日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人昨天说，英国已经授权给它的所有殖民地的政府，允许它们发出口执照给申请人，以便把到现在为止禁止运往中国但是可以出口给苏联的货物运往中国。
    这个发言人是在谈到关于马来亚和新加坡政府取消对中国输出橡胶的禁令的时候这样说的。他还说，各殖民地政府在考虑出口执照申请的时候，可以在“适当”限度内自由运用它们的判断，而不需要具体地同伦敦商量。
    据路透社说，英国在没有争取到美国赞同修改禁运政策之后，目前正在利用“例外程序”来增加英联邦的输出。根据
  “例外程序”的规定，参加“统筹委员会”的任何国家“可以在它认为这样做是合乎它的极关重要的国家利益的时候”允许输出一些受禁的货物。
    路透社消息还说：橡胶并不是唯一将受到英国新措施影响的商品。英国官员们解释说，其他一些对中国“禁运”而对苏联不禁运的商品，也可能会受到影响。
    据新华社5日讯　英国宣布准许它的殖民地放宽对中国贸易禁运的消息，在华盛顿和伦敦引起了不同的反应。
    据美联社驻华盛顿记者报道，美国政府官员对英国这种决定“感到不快”。
    但是在伦敦，据法新社记者贝拉密说，人们认为英国这个决定意味着贸易
  “禁运”开始“瓦解”。他说：伦敦从事对中国贸易的人士预料，主持禁运的“统筹委员会”的其他成员国不久也可能效法英国。
    据新华社6日讯　伦敦报纸报道，英国商界人士普遍欢迎准许马来亚对中国输出橡胶。各报发表评论，对这件事表示赞许，有些报纸还希望解除对其他货物的禁运。
    工党的“每日先驱报”认为：“整个禁运已经没有意义。”自由党的“新闻纪事报”提到锡兰早就卖橡胶给中国，它说：“禁运被认为是荒谬的。”
    保守党的“每日电讯报”的社论说：“放松马来亚对共产党中国的橡胶输出禁令是一个明智的行动……这种禁运在很大程度上是不起作用的。保持禁运是为了尊重美国国会的意见，而不是出于什么正当的战略利益考虑。”
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院拒绝对英国准许马来亚等地向中国输出橡胶这件事马上发表意见。但是，据合众社记者乌尔斯德说，美国政府感到很担心。　　乌尔斯德说：“从政府的观点来看，陷阱就在这里：既然英国已经领头扩大同中国共产党的贸易，其他国家就会得到鼓励而采取同样的行动。如果容忍禁运货单有太多的例外，那末，这些例外就会不再是例外，而这种管制（指贸易“禁运”）也就会很快地名存实亡。”
    美国民主党参议员杰克逊昨天说：“英国所做的是打开同共产党中国贸易的水闸，这是一个使人非常遗憾的局面。
    共和党参议员蒙特也攻击英国，认为这样作是犯了“惨重的错误”。
