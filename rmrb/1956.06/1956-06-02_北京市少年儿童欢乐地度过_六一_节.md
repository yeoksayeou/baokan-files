Xinhua News Agency, June 1st - Beijing's children joyfully celebrated their holiday today.

From morning till night, the children participated in various activities according to their interests. Some watched national defense sports performances at the Children's Palace Stadium, while others enjoyed wonderful programs performed by more than twenty art troupes. Three exhibitions, specifically opened for children's toys, children's clothing, and children's books, aroused great interest among the children. A new Children's Home, built next to Taoranting Park, also officially opened today. Six more such Children's Homes will be established in the city this year.

Daycare organizations in the urban areas generally held parent-child gatherings today, discussing issues related to children's education. At the Young Pioneers activist meeting held in Xuanwu District, the children wrote a letter to Mayor Peng Zhen, reporting on the achievements of their mini-Five-Year Plan. The more than 70,000 sunflowers and castor beans they planted in the spring have all grown, and more than 3,000 Young Pioneers have deposited more than 1,300 yuan of pocket money in their own small banks. The children also eliminated 27,000 sparrows and mice.

At the back river of the Working People's Cultural Palace, the Ministry of Communications presented a jet-propelled shallow-water tugboat to the children of Beijing. The ship was named "Young Pioneer." China's first fully automated Young Pioneer hydroelectric power station also broke ground today next to the Cultural Relics Hall in Beihai Park.

In the evening, bonfires blazed and colorful fireworks were set off in Beihai Park. More than a thousand children drifted on light boats, enjoying the beautiful night scenery.

Xinhua News Agency, June 1st - More than 1,600 Chinese and foreign children celebrated "June 1st" International Children's Day in the new hall of the Beijing Hotel today.

At eight o'clock in the morning, groups of children wearing flower-like clothes kept walking into the hall. The spacious hall was immediately filled with vitality.

Beijing Vice Mayor Wu Han attended the meeting today to congratulate the children on the festival. He said: In this year, you have not only grown physically and increased your knowledge, but you have also proposed a mini-Five-Year Plan for the motherland, and used your own laboring hands to do many commendable things. Your efforts today for the construction of the motherland will enable you to contribute even greater strength to the motherland when you grow up in the future.

The band played children's favorite dance music. With the rhythm of the music, more and more children entered the dance circle. Smiling and dancing, Chinese children and foreign children, who were originally unfamiliar with each other, quickly became close friends. Cheng Lizhou and other four children from the Beijing Dance School made an appointment with Soviet children to write to each other in the future. Indonesian child Biyano saw his neighbor Dong Yanyi from Dongguanyinsi Primary School, and immediately pulled him over and introduced his Burmese, Indian and Pakistani friends to him in Chinese. Yu Anling, Kang Suwei from Bamiacao Primary School and Yugoslavian children Duda and Nada became good friends. Nada happily sang "The East is Red" in Chinese. Guo Moruo, Cai Chang, Dong Xin, Hu Keshi, Fu Lianzhang, Chen Zenggu, Ye Shengtao, as well as many writers, musicians and heads of various departments in Beijing, also played with the children today. The wife of Jakarta Mayor Sudiro of Indonesia and many international friends in Beijing also played with the children.

At twelve o'clock, the children danced the "Train Dance," with more than a dozen children strung together into "trains" slowly moving towards the center of the hall. When the meeting ended, everyone happily sang the Song of the Young Pioneers.

    北京市少年儿童欢乐地度过“六一”节
    据新华社1日讯　北京市少年儿童今天欢乐地度过了自己的节日。
    从早到晚，少年儿童们根据自己的爱好参加了各种各样的活动。他们有的在少年宫体育场里观看国防体育表演，有的在欣赏由二十多个文艺团体演出的精采节目。专门开放的儿童玩具、儿童服装、儿童读物三个展览会，引起了孩子们很大的兴趣。建筑在陶然亭公园旁的一座新的少年之家也在今天正式开幕。今年全市还将建立六座这样的少年之家。
    城区的托儿组织今天普遍举行了家长联欢会，座谈教育儿童的问题。在宣武区举行的少先队员积极分子大会上，孩子们给彭真市长写了一封信，汇报他们小五年计划中的成绩。他们春天种下的七万多棵向日葵、蓖麻都长起来了，三千多个少先队员在自己设立的小银行里存了一千三百多元零用钱。孩子们还消灭了二万七千只麻雀和老鼠。
    在劳动人民文化宫后河里，交通部把一只喷水式浅水拖轮送给了北京的儿童们。轮船被命名为“少年先锋号”。中国第一座全部自动化的少年先锋队水电站今天也在北海公园文物馆旁边动工。
    到了晚上，北海公园里燃起了熊熊的营火和放起了彩色的焰火。有一千多个儿童荡漾着轻舟欣赏这优美的夜景。
    新华社1日讯　一千六百多个中外儿童今天在北京饭店新大厅里欢庆“六一”国际儿童节。
    上午八时，一群群穿着花朵般衣服的儿童就不断地走进大厅。宽阔的大厅里立刻充满了生气。
    北京市副市长吴晗今天到会向孩子们祝贺节日。他说：在这一年中，你们不但长了身体，长了知识，同时你们还向祖国提出了小五年计划，用自己爱劳动的双手干出了不少值得称赞的事情。你们今天为祖国建设而努力，将来长大了也就能为祖国贡献出更大的力量。
    乐队奏起了儿童喜爱的舞曲。随着音乐的节奏，越来越多的儿童走进了舞圈。他们笑着跳着，原来互相还不熟悉的中国儿童和外国儿童们很快就变成了亲热的朋友。北京舞蹈学校程礼舟等四个孩子和苏联小朋友沙良约好今后要互相通信。印度尼西亚儿童毕亚诺看到了他的邻居东观音寺小学的董燕义以后，立即拉住他，并且用中国话把自己的缅甸、印度和巴基斯坦的小朋友介绍给他。八面槽小学俞安玲、康素薇和南斯拉夫儿童杜达、娜达变成了好朋友，娜达高兴地用中国话唱了“东方红”。今天和孩子们在一起玩的还有郭沫若、蔡畅、董昕、胡克实、傅连暲、陈曾固、叶圣陶，以及许多作家、音乐家和北京市各部门的负责人。印度尼西亚雅加达特别市市长苏迪罗的夫人和许多在北京的国际友人也和孩子们在一起玩。
    到十二点钟，儿童们跳起了“火车舞”，由十多个儿童串成的一个个“火车”慢慢走向大厅中央。当大会结束的时候，大家快乐地唱起了红领巾之歌。
