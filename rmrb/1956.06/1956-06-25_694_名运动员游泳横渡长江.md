Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 24th. Today, six hundred and ninety-four athletes swam across the Yangtze River.

　　The river surface from Wuchang to Hankou is approximately 1,300 meters wide. The starting point of the competition was the river surface at the Wuchang Dati Kou, and the finish line was the "Sanbei Wharf" in Hankou, a distance of 5,000 meters. At exactly 10:00 AM, after the first starting gun fired, ninety-six athletes jumped into the water from wooden rafts scattered at the starting point. At 10:30 AM, Zhang Fusheng, a twenty-year-old student from the Central South Academy of Fine Arts, was the first to reach the finish line. He started learning to swim at the age of eight and swam across the Gan River in Jiangxi at the age of thirteen.

　　Tens of thousands of Wuhan citizens, students, and cadres watched today's swimming competition. After the start of the competition, a level 3 to 4 southeasterly wind blew across the river, and the river water flowed by at a speed of 1.34 meters per second. After the athletes entered the river, they struggled to break free from the backflow along the river and swam along the eastward current. Behind each of them closely followed a protective boat with life-saving equipment, carefully escorting them.

　　When the first group of athletes reached the finish line, the second group of athletes immediately began the competition. Nineteen female athletes participated in the second group of the competition. When each female athlete came ashore, they immediately received enthusiastic cheers and greetings from the people watching the competition. Chao Xinmin, a mother of five children, swam to the finish line today along with the men. She is the head nurse of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College and has twenty-one years of swimming experience.

　　More than 2,000 people registered for the competition this time, and 761 people participated in today's competition. It was conducted in eight batches in the morning and afternoon. At 7:30 PM, all of today's competitions ended. Six hundred and ninety-four athletes crossed the Yangtze River, of which 457 landed at the designated finish line; 237 swam to the opposite bank of Hankou but did not reach the designated finish line. Athletes who did not participate in the river crossing today will continue to compete on July 1st.

    694名运动员游泳横渡长江
    新华社武汉24日电　今天，六百九十四名运动员游泳横渡过长江。
    从武昌到汉口的江面宽约一千三百多公尺，比赛的起点是武昌大堤口江面，终点是汉口“三北码头”，距离五千公尺。上午十时正，九十六名运动员在第一声发令枪响了后，分别从散布在起点的木划上跃入水里。十点三十分，二十岁的中南美术专科学校学生张抚生第一个到达终点。他在八岁时就开始学游泳，十三岁时曾经在江西游泳渡过赣江。
    成千上万的武汉市民、学生、机关干部等观看了今天的游泳比赛。比赛开始后，江面上刮起了三级到四级的东南风，江水以每秒钟一点三四公尺的流速奔腾而过。运动员们投入江中以后，奋力摆脱了沿江的回流，顺着东流水势游去。在他们每个人的身后紧紧跟着的、有救生设备的保护船，小心地护送着他们。
    当第一批运动员到达终点的时候，第二批运动员紧接着又开始比赛了。十九名女运动员参加了第二批的比赛。当每个女运动员一上岸时，立刻受到来看比赛的人们的热情的欢呼和慰问。五个孩子的妈妈晁新民今天同男子一道游到了终点。她是武汉医学院附属第一医院的护士长，有二十一年的游泳经验。
    这一次报名参加比赛的有二千多人，参加今天比赛的有七百六十一人；上下午分八批进行，下午七点三十分，今天全部比赛结束，有六百九十四名运动员渡过了长江，其中在规定终点登岸的有四百五十七人；游到汉口对岸但未达到规定终点的有二百三十七人。今天没有参加渡江的运动员将在七月一日继续进行比赛。
