    Meixian's Youth Football Movement
    At the Youth Sports Meeting held in Meixian, Guangdong Province, on Children's Day "June 1st", there was a youth football match. In this match, the young athletes changed their usual long-pass, rapid-attack style of play and initially used triangular short-pass offensive tactics. They were very fast, and their ball control and passing skills were also quite proficient.
    Since 1953, the youth football movement in Meixian has developed greatly. Now there are a total of 168 youth football teams in the county.
    The eight teams participating in this competition were selected from the county's seventy-seven better youth football teams. This competition will select the Meixian youth football team. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    梅县的少年足球运动
    广东省梅县在“六一”儿童节举行的少年体育运动大会上，有一项少年足球比赛。小运动员们在这场比赛中，改变了惯用的长传急攻的打法，初步运用三角短传的进攻战术，速度很快，控球、传球的技术也相当熟练。
    梅县的少年足球运动从1953年以来有了很大的发展，现在全县共有少年足球队168队。
    参加这次比赛的八个队是从全县七十七个较好的少年足球队中选拔出来的。这次比赛将选出梅县的少年足球代表队。　（据新华社讯）
