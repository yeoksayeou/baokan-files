    New York Stocks Decline
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from New York: The June 3rd issue of "Business Week" referred to May as "the worst month for the stock market since the war" when discussing the decline in New York stock prices in May. According to the magazine, the average price of stocks on the exchange fell by approximately 10.3% compared to the peak in early April.

    "Business Week" believes that the factors contributing to this situation are, first and foremost, the decrease in orders received by entrepreneurs and the increase in inventories. The magazine pointed out that the total amount of new orders for durable goods received by industrialists in June has decreased by 2.2 billion US dollars compared to last December.

    United Press reporter Moore Cabot, in a dispatch on May 29th, said that the stock decline "worries many people." He believes that the decline in stock prices reflects "a decrease in interest in buying stocks" and that "investors are clearly willing to take a wait-and-see attitude until the economic situation becomes clearer." Moore Cabot pointed out that the production of sectors such as the American automobile industry, construction industry, and agricultural machinery manufacturing industry is currently declining. Although some American economic experts hope that production activities will rebound in the fourth quarter, they cannot help but admit that "a decline will undoubtedly occur in the third quarter."

    纽约股票下跌
    新华社讯　纽约消息：六月三日一期的“商业周刊”在谈到五月份纽约股票行情下跌的时候，把五月份称为“战后股票市场最坏的一个月”。据这家杂志说，交易所的股票牌价平均比四月初的最高水平下跌了大约10.3％。
    “商业周刊”认为造成这种情况的因素首先是企业家所获得的订货数量减少和存货增加。杂志指出，六月份工业家所获得的对耐用商品的新订货的总额已经比去年十二月减少了二十二亿美元。
    合众社记者摩尔卡在五月二十九日的一条消息中说，股票下跌的情况“使好多人发愁”。他认为，股票价格下跌反映了“购买股票的兴趣减少”，“投资者显然愿意在经济情况进一步澄清之前采取观望态度”。摩尔卡指出，目前美国的汽车业、建筑业和农业机器制造业等部门的生产正在下跌，美国的一些经济专家们虽然希望第四季的生产活动会回升，但是同时却不能不承认“第三季无疑会发生下降的情况”。
