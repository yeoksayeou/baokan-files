    Cheering for the Further Development of China's Textile Industry
    -- Speech by Representative Liu Guojun

    I fully support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget; and I express extraordinary excitement and satisfaction with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's speech on the implementation of our country's First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, especially regarding the section on the tasks stipulated in our country's First Five-Year Plan being completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the development of the textile industry.

    In the 1955 national final accounts, because cotton production was reduced due to flooding in 1954, the original textile factories could not all operate at full capacity, thus reducing new construction projects. The actual investment only accounted for 60.62% of the budget, which was appropriate. In 1955, there was a bumper cotton harvest, and the amount of state budget investment related to the textile industry in 1956 increased by 132.14% compared to 1955. This shows that to develop light industry, it is necessary to first solve the raw material problem. If raw materials are abundant, the state will increase investment to expand production in light industries that meet the people's needs, such as the textile industry. I believe this is also correct.

    From the perspective of international trade, the development of China's textile industry also has great significance. Comrade Mikoyan of the 20th Congress of the CPSU once said: "It is not equally beneficial for all countries to produce all products. It is easier to produce this product in this country, and easier to produce other products in another country... In this sense, international trade has been and is a manifestation of the rational international division of labor." Recently, representatives from China and Yugoslavia, with observer status, participated in the regular meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of the eight European countries led by the Soviet Union, where concrete discussions were held on the issue of mutual coordination in the long-term development of the national economy among the participating countries. In the future, among socialist countries, the long-term development of each country's national economy should be combined with the interests of the entire socialist camp, based on factors such as product sales and raw material sources, to create preconditions for the widespread implementation of production specialization and collaboration among socialist countries. In the international trade market, cotton textiles are the most numerous, most consumed, and most popular commodities. Before World War II, Japan exported a maximum of 4 billion square yards of cotton textiles annually; the United Kingdom exported a maximum of 7 billion square yards of cotton textiles annually; however, neither the United Kingdom nor Japan are cotton-producing countries. China has better conditions for developing textiles. I believe that we should develop the textile industry well, and we should and can meet the international market's need for cotton textiles.

    The climate and soil in many areas of China are suitable for growing cotton. According to the national plan, by the last year of our Third Five-Year Plan, i.e., 1967, China's annual cotton production may reach 100 million dan of ginned cotton. How many spindles are needed to match this cotton production? At the same time, it is necessary to gradually add spindles for spinning fine-count cotton yarn, requiring approximately 30 million spindles. Therefore, China's textile industry must be greatly developed, gradually expanded or newly built, to meet the needs of the cotton textile industry. At the same time, relevant departments should vigorously cultivate talent in all aspects of spinning, weaving, printing, dyeing, international trade, and business management, in order to coordinate with the development of the textile industry. With such planned development, in the future, we can exchange annually 3-5 billion yuan worth of cotton yarn and cloth for materials that our country needs to import.

    Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his speech: "Giving priority to the development of heavy industry is a central link in realizing socialist industrialization and a fundamental issue in our country's construction." He also said: "If we truly want to build heavy industry, we must develop light industry." I believe that this completely and correctly explains the relationship between heavy industry and light industry. In his speech, he also gave the following example: "A textile factory with 100,000 spindles only requires an investment of 35 million yuan, and the construction time is only 13 months, while such a factory can generate more than 34.9 million yuan in industrial and commercial profits and taxes annually." This shows that the textile industry has great profits, and developing the textile industry is a practical and feasible way to accumulate funds for the country's socialist industrialization. Moreover, the development of the textile industry requires many supporting industries to work in coordination. Therefore, if we can pay attention to the textile industry as the main target while developing heavy industry, and then use the profits from the textile industry to develop heavy industry and other industries, such mutual cooperation and common development will be of great benefit to realizing national industrialization and meeting the needs of the broad masses of people.

    I have been engaged in the textile industry for 40 years. However, before liberation, I always wanted to expand, but I was never able to fulfill my wishes. Although our country has the natural conditions for producing cotton, and also has a certain foundation in the technical management of the textile industry, under the oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, although we survived through hardships and difficulties, our textile industry was still on the verge of dying. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can our country's industry, including the textile industry, achieve true development. Therefore, I wholeheartedly and joyfully cheer for the socialist industrialization of our great motherland! And cheer for the further development of China's textile industry!

### 为我国纺织工业的进一步发展而欢呼

    为我国纺织工业的进一步发展而欢呼
    ——刘国钧代表的发言
    我完全拥护李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告；并对李富春副总理关于我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划执行情况的发言，特别是对我国第一个五年计划中所规定的任务将要被提前完成和超额完成一节，表示异常兴奋和满意。现在，我仅就发展纺织工业问题，发表一些意见。
    在1955年国家决算中，因为1954年棉花遭受水灾减产，原有纺织工厂不能全部开工，因而削减了新的建设项目，实际投资只占预算的60.62％，这是恰当的。1955年棉花丰收，1956年国家预算有关纺织工业投资金额即较1955年增加了132.14％。这说明了要发展轻工业，必须先解决原料问题，如果原料充裕，国家对人民生活需要的轻工业如纺织工业，就增加投资扩大生产，我认为这也是正确的。
    从国际贸易来讲，我国发展纺织工业也有其重大意义。苏共第二十次代表大会米高扬同志曾经这样说过：“并不是所有国家生产一切产品都同样有利的。在这个国家里生产这种产品更容易些，而在另外的国家中生产别的产品更容易些，……在这个意义上，国际贸易过去和现在都是合理的国际劳动分工的表现。”最近我国和南斯拉夫代表以观察员身份参加的，由苏联、欧洲各人民民主国家组成的欧洲八国经济互助委员会常会上，对与会各国之间在国民经济远景发展上相互配合的问题，更进行了具体的讨论。今后，在社会主义各国之间，每一个国家的国民经济发展远景，都应该根据产品销售和原料来源等情况，和整个社会主义阵营的利益结合起来，为社会主义各国之间广泛实行生产专业化和协作化创造前提。在国际贸易市场上，棉织品是数量最多、消费最大、深受欢迎的商品。在第二次世界大战以前，日本每年最多曾输出40亿方码的棉织品；英国每年最多曾输出70亿方码的棉织品；但是英国和日本都不是出产棉花的国家。我国发展纺织条件较好，我认为，我们应该很好的发展纺织工业，我们应该也可能适应国际市场对于棉纺织品的需要。
    我国不少地区的气候和土壤都适宜种植棉花。按照国家计划，我国到第三个五年计划的最后一年即1967年，棉花年产量可能达到一万万担皮棉。要有多少纱锭来配合这个棉花产量呢？同时并须逐步添纺细支棉纱大约需要3，000万枚纱锭。因此，我国的纺织工业，必须大量发展，逐步扩建或新建，以适应棉纺织工业的需要。同时，有关部门还应该大力培养纺、织、印、染和国际贸易、商业管理等各方面的人材，以求配合纺织工业的发展。这样有计划的发展，将来可以年有价值30—50亿元的纱布，向外交换我国需要进口的物资。
    李富春副总理在这次发言中指出：“优先发展重工业，是实现社会主义工业化的一个中心环节，也是我国建设的一个根本问题。”又说：“如果真正要建设重工业，就必须发展轻工业。”我认为这是完全正确地说明了重工业和轻工业的关系。他在发言中并举出这样一个例子：“一个10万锭子的纺织厂，投资只要3，500万元，建设时间只要13个月，而这样一个厂每年产品的工商利润和税收，即可收入3，490余万元。”这就说明纺织工业的利润很大，发展纺织工业是为国家社会主义工业化积累资金的一条切实可行的途径。而且，发展纺织工业，需要有很多的附属工业相辅而行，因此我们如果能在发展重工业时，注意以纺织工业为主要对象，并再以纺织工业利润发展重工业和其他工业，这样相互协作，共同发展，对实现国家工业化和满足广大人民需要，都是有很大好处的。
    我从事纺织工业40年。但在解放以前，一直想从事扩充，始终未能如愿，因我国虽有生产棉花的自然条件，在纺织工业的技术管理上也有一定的基础，但是在帝国主义和官僚资本主义的压迫下，虽然历经艰难困苦生存着，但是我们的纺织工业仍不免奄奄待毙，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我国的工业包括纺织工业在内才能得到真正的发展。因此，我满怀信心地、万分高兴地为我们伟大祖国的社会主义工业化而欢呼！为我国纺织工业的进一步发展而欢呼！
