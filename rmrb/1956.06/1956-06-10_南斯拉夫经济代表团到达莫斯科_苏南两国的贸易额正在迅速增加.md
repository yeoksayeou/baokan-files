    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 9th, via TASS: A Yugoslav government economic delegation, led by Federal State Secretary for Finance, Humo, arrived in Moscow by plane from Belgrade on the 7th.
    The delegation will hold negotiations with relevant Soviet authorities to discuss Soviet-Yugoslav cooperation in constructing a series of industrial enterprises in Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Union's supply of equipment needed by the industrial and agricultural sectors of Yugoslavia.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 9th: Trade volume between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is rapidly increasing. Currently, the Soviet Union ranks fourth in both Yugoslavia's exports and imports. Last year, the Soviet Union ranked eighth in Yugoslavia's exports and fourteenth in imports.

    In the first quarter of this year, Yugoslavia's total exports increased by an average of 32.5%, while exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies increased by 240%. The Soviet Union accounted for 56.5% of the total value of goods exported to these countries.

    These facts about Soviet-Yugoslav trade were mentioned in a recent article published in the Yugoslav magazine "Economic Review."

    The article, entitled "Soviet Foreign Trade and Yugoslavia," pointed out that the normalization of political relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union immediately affected the rapid growth of trade volume between the two countries, which is entirely understandable. This development of trade relations enables Yugoslavia to sell its exports to new markets and improves Yugoslavia's supply of raw materials and equipment for its industrial production.

    南斯拉夫经济代表团到达莫斯科
    苏南两国的贸易额正在迅速增加
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：南斯拉夫政府经济代表团，由联邦财政国务秘书胡莫率领，七日从贝尔格莱德乘飞机到达莫斯科。
    代表团将和苏联有关方面进行谈判，商谈苏南两国合作在南斯拉夫建设一系列工业企业，以及苏联供应南斯拉夫的工、农业各部门所需的装备问题。
    据新华社布拉格9日电　南斯拉夫同苏联的贸易额正在迅速增加。现在，在南斯拉夫的出口和进口额中，苏联都占第四位。而在去年，在南斯拉夫的出口额中，苏联是第八位，进口是第十四位。
    今年第一季度中，南斯拉夫的出口总额平均增加了32.5％，而对苏联和东欧人民民主国家的出口额增加了240％。在对这些国家输出的商品总额中，苏联占了56.5％。
    苏南贸易的这些情况，是最近一期的南斯拉夫“经济评论”杂志发表的一篇文章中谈到的。
    这篇题为“苏联的对外贸易和南斯拉夫”的文章指出，南斯拉夫同苏联之间政治关系的正常化，立刻就影响到两国之间的贸易额的迅速增长，这是完全可以理解的。贸易关系的这种发展，使南斯拉夫能够把它的出口货销售给新的市场，使南斯拉夫能够改善它的工业生产的原料和设备的供应。
