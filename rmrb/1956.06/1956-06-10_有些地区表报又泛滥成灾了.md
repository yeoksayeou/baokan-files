(I) Editor:

    In the three districts of Cangji, Baji, and Yingmen in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, various units issued a total of 104 types of forms in March and April, of which 21 needed to be submitted regularly. Among these reports, many are completely unnecessary. For example, the Women's Federation of Baji District issued a "Pregnant Women Registration Form," which required filling in the pregnancy date, months of pregnancy, number of check-ups, delivery date, delivery method (including new method, old method, self-delivery), as well as the baby's name, gender, whether the baby died, cause of death, and other items. Another example is the "Daily Temperature Report Form" issued by the Technology Extension Station of Yingmen District, which required each agricultural cooperative to fill it out every day. Many agricultural cooperatives do not have thermometers and cannot fill it out; in fact, the temperature in a district does not vary much, and there is no need to report it. In addition, there are many duplicate reports.

    Too many reports have caused a serious waste of manpower. It is understood that in these three districts, an average of one to two people in each agricultural cooperative are busy filling out forms every day. Zhu Heng, the accountant of Lao Wei Agricultural Cooperative, could not complete the task of filling out reports every day, and he simply hid himself for fear that the township government would send someone to urge him. Some township governments even sent people to urge the submission of forms in order to submit the forms in a timely manner. For example, Hu Miao Township had to send two correspondents to various agricultural cooperatives every day to urge the submission of forms. However, after these forms were filled out with a lot of manpower and submitted to the leading organs, some of them were shelved.

    In addition, the situation of "the higher-ups want it, the lower-ups make it" has also appeared. For example, Huang Zui Township reported the area of ​​land planted with corn three times, because they were all estimates, the three times were three different figures: the first time was 14,000 mu, the second time it became 17,000 mu, and the third time it became 11,000 mu.

    With the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the investigation and statistical work of the party and government leading organs at all levels on the rural situation needs to be strengthened. At this time, I think we must pay special attention to preventing the practice of indiscriminate issuance of reports. Ji Changmao

    Just as spring production is in full swing, some leading organs are issuing a large number of statistical reports, making it impossible for grassroots cadres to cope. Taking the situation in Xinpu District, Jiaoling County, Guangdong Province, as an example, from May 13th to 18th, 19 types of forms were directly sent to the townships, including 7 from the County Party Committee, 6 from the County Statistics Section, 1 from the County People's Committee, 1 from the Seed Inspection Station, and 4 to be printed by the District Committee. These forms are all "urgent" and require submission within three or four days. Many of the reports are repetitive. Some reports have cumbersome items, such as how many stem borers were burned, how many urine buckets were washed, and how many pig pens there were. There are also some statistical figures that the leading organs can actually grasp through relevant units, but they insist on having the lower levels fill them out.

    What happens after these forms are sent down? On the one hand, the cadres at the lower levels are busy completing the tasks, which affects their daily work. For example, the Oil Pit Township Party Branch received nine types of forms on the afternoon of the 13th, all of which had to be submitted on the 14th. At that time, they were carrying out the work of rectifying the Party branch. That night, they had to stop the meeting and concentrate their efforts on filling out the forms; even so, they were busy until 12 o'clock in the evening before they could put the figures together. On the other hand, although the leading organs stated "the figures in this form must be accurate" when issuing statistical reports, in reality, there are still many false elements in the figures filled out below. For example, Xu Xi Township once required statistics on the area of rice planted by each agricultural cooperative production team according to the requirements of the higher authorities. As a result, after two surveys, the second figure was 600 mu more than the first; the township staff did not know which figure was accurate, and they did not have time to check it again, so they decided to report the first figure.

(III) Editor:

    I am the propaganda officer of the North Mountain District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, and I once temporarily worked as the secretary of the District Committee. I have been working as a secretary for less than a month, and I deeply feel that there is a problem that must be solved quickly. That is: now there are too many statistical reports issued by the superior party and government departments to the lower levels.

    In a month, I received an average of three reports every day. Most of these reports have to be submitted within a time limit, and many of them have to be submitted regularly (every five days to a month). There are as many as 51 types of briefs, statistical tables, and survey forms issued by the Rural Work Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Water Resources, the Department of Forestry, and the Sheng County Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, all of which have numerous and very complex items. So many statistical reports greatly exceed the actual reporting capacity of grassroots cadres. Therefore, in order to submit the reports on time according to the requirements of the higher authorities, the clerks of each township have to take estimates to cope (of course, not every time).

    The purpose of the relevant leading organs to issue statistical reports is to understand the actual work and problems at the lower level, so as to strengthen leadership and improve work. However, as it is now, there are too many reports, and the materials filled in are not accurate, so how can the purpose of understanding the situation be achieved? It is hoped that the organs that produce and issue reports will sit less and ask for all kinds of reports, and go down more to understand the actual work and problems. Although some reports are necessary, the items can also be appropriately streamlined and the number of submissions can be reduced.

### 有些地区表报又泛滥成灾了

    有些地区表报又泛滥成灾了
                         （一）编辑同志：
    江苏省泗阳县仓集、八集、营门三个区的各单位在三、四月份内共发表格一百零四种，其中有二十一种还是需要定期上报的。在这些报表中，有不少是根本不必要的。例如八集区妇联制发了一种“孕妇登记表”，规定要填孕妇怀孕日期、怀孕月数、检查次数、生产日期、生产方式（包括新法、老法、自产）以及婴儿姓名、婴儿性别、婴儿有否死亡、死亡原因等等项目。又如营门区技术推广站制发了一种“温度逐日报告表”，要求每个农业社每天填报一次。很多农业社根本没有寒暑表，无法填报；实际上在一个区里气温也不会有什么大的差别，并没有报告的必要。此外，重复的表报也很多。
    表报过多，造成了严重的人力浪费。据了解，这三个区的每一个农业社每天平均有一个到两个人是在为填报表格而奔忙。老圩农业社会计朱恒因为每天填表报都不能完成任务，怕乡政府派人来催，便索性躲了起来。有些乡政府为了把表格及时上交，还专门派人做催办工作。如胡庙乡每天都要派两个通讯员到各个农业社去催办表格。但是，这些表格花了大量人力填好了，交到领导机关之后，有的却被束之高阁了。
    另外，“上面要，下面造”的情况也出现了。像黄咀乡曾经三次上报种玉米的土地面积，因为都是估计的，三次就是三个样子：第一次是一万四千亩，第二次变成了一万七千亩，第三次又成了一万一千亩。
    随着农业合作化运动的发展，各级党政领导机关对农村情况的调查统计工作需要加强。在这个时候，我认为必须特别注意防止滥发表报的做法。　季长茂
                       （二）编辑同志：
    正当春季生产紧张进行的时候，有些领导机关却大发统计表报，使基层干部应接不暇，无法“招架”。就拿我们广东省蕉岭县新铺区的情况来说，从五月十三日到十八日直接发到乡的表格便有十九种，其中县委会发来的七种，县统计科发来的六种，县人民委员会发来一种，种子检查站发的一种，区委拟印的四种。这些表格都是“速件”，要求在三、四天之内上报。有很多表报的内容是重复的。有的表报项目繁琐，例如要填写烧了螟蛾几只，洗了尿缸几口和猪栏几间。也有一些统计数字实际上领导机关只要通过有关单位就可以掌握的，但是却非要下面填报不可。
    这些表格发下去以后的情况怎样呢？一方面，下面的干部为了完成任务，忙得不亦乐乎，影响了日常的工作。如油坑乡党支部在十三日下午接到九种表格，都是十四日要上报的。当时他们正在进行整顿党支部的工作，那天晚上只好把会议停下来不开了，集中人力来填表格；就这样，还一直忙到深夜十二点钟，才把数字凑好了。另一方面，尽管领导机关在发统计表报时注明了“此表数字必须填得准确”，但是实际上下面填报的数字仍然有不少虚假成分。如徐溪乡曾经根据上级要求统计各农业社生产队的水稻种植面积，结果调查了两次，第二次的数字比第一次的数字多了六百亩；乡里工作人员也不知道究竟那个数字是准确的，又没有时间再核对，只好决定用第一次的数字报上去了。

                       （三）编辑同志：
    我是中共浙江嵊县北山区委会的宣传干事，曾经暂时代做区委秘书的工作。我做秘书不到一个月时间，深深感到有个问题非赶快解决不可。这就是：现在上级党、政部门发到下面去的统计表报太多了。
    一个月来，我每天平均要接到三张表报。这些表报大部分是要限期上报的，其中有很多还要每隔一定时期（五天到一个月不等）上报一次。光是有关农业生产和互助合作这一类的表报就有中共浙江省委农村工作部、浙江省统计局、农业厅、水利厅、林业厅和嵊县农林水利局所发的简报、统计表、调查表等五十一种，每一种都是项目繁多，非常复杂。这样多的统计表报，大大超过了基层干部的实际填报能力。于是，各乡的文书为了根据上级要求把表报按时上报，只好采取估计的办法来应付（当然不是每一次都是如此）。
    有关领导机关发统计表报的目的，是为了了解下面实际工作中的情况和问题，以便加强领导，改进工作。但是，像现在这样，表报太多了，填写的材料反而不准确，这又怎么能达到了解情况的目的呢？希望制发表报的机关，少坐在上面要各式各样的表报，多深入下来了解实际工作中的情况和问题。有些表报虽然有必要，也可以适当精简项目和减少上报次数。
