　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 5th June: Jiangxi Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of barley and wheat. The province’s 2.44 million mu of wheat saw a 23% increase in yield per mu, with a total output increase of approximately 48.5% compared to last year, exceeding the planned output by 23%. The province’s 1.32 million mu of barley saw a 9.5% increase in yield per mu, with a total output increase of approximately 30% compared to last year. In Jiujiang County, the Laodong Agricultural Production Cooperative had over 400 mu of wheat fields in a low-lying area, historically prone to waterlogging, yielding only about 30 jin per mu. After becoming an advanced cooperative this year, the members dug ditches and drained the waterlogged areas, resulting in a harvest of 113 jin of wheat per mu.
　　Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in various locations are actively engaged in the income distribution of spring-ripening crops.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 5th June: In Jiujiang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, 2,995 agricultural production cooperatives have already completed the preliminary distribution of the spring harvest. During the preliminary distribution, all cooperatives implemented the principle of "deducting less and distributing more," allocating 75% to 80% of the total income to the members, thereby increasing the actual income of the vast majority of members. Among the 82,451 households in 1,754 cooperatives in seven counties including Jiujiang, Duchang, and Hukou, 78,581 households increased or maintained their production, accounting for 95% of the total households. In Xingzi County, the Hongxing Advanced Cooperative achieved a 100% increase in income for its members. In these agricultural cooperatives, the income of ordinary members generally increased by about 20% compared to last year, with some reaching 50% to 100%.

　　During the distribution, advanced cooperatives in various locations conscientiously implemented the principle of "distribution according to labor, more work more gain," greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the members. After the preliminary distribution in the Chuantan Advanced Cooperative in Wuning County, all 250 male and female laborers in the cooperative attended work every day. Through the distribution, many new cooperatives established and improved their financial systems.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, 5th June: The more than two million mu of early rice in the Chao (An) - Shan (Tou) Plain, a nationally renowned high-yield rice area, are beginning to turn yellow, and will be ready for harvest in another half month.

　　Many farmers told reporters that this year's early rice is growing particularly well, with uniform heading, no empty ears, and full grains, and can yield at least 10% to 20% more than last year.

　　Reporters learned from the agricultural department of Shantou Prefecture that this year, the Chao-Shan Plain promoted the method of sparse sowing of 30 to 50 jin per mu of seedling field to cultivate strong seedlings, so that all early rice could implement small-plant close planting. The rice plants headed uniformly, with long ears and full grains. Due to the widespread selection of improved varieties and the adoption of various disinfection measures, the damage from rice stem borers, which occurred in previous years, was avoided. During the mid-cultivation period, agricultural cooperatives implemented advanced irrigation methods of shallow water and frequent irrigation, generally achieving no rotten seedlings and no lodging. When the early rice was flowering, members of many agricultural cooperatives went deep into the fields to apply a single dose of fast-acting fertilizer to some seedlings that were growing poorly due to late transplanting. These seedlings quickly turned strong and caught up with the good rice.

　　Now, farmers in the Chao-Shan Plain are actively repairing farm tools, preparing for the bumper harvest.

    江西省今年大麦小麦空前丰收
    潮汕平原的早稻可比去年多收一两成
    本报南昌5日电　江西省大麦、小麦空前丰收。全省244万多亩小麦，单位面积产量比去年提高23％，总产量约比去年增加48.5％，超过计划产量23％。全省132万多亩大麦，单位面积产量提高9.5％，总产量约比去年增加30％。九江县劳动农业生产合作社有四百多亩麦地，地势低洼，历年来都渍水成涝，每亩只收三十斤左右。今年建成高级社以后，社员们在这片麦地上开了沟，排了渍水，每亩麦子收了113斤。
    目前，各地农业生产合作社正在积极进行春熟作物收益分配工作。
    本报南昌5日电　江西省九江专区已经有2，995个农业生产合作社结束了春收预分工作。在预分中，各社都贯彻执行了“少扣多分”的原则，将总收入的75％到80％分配给社员，使绝大多数社员都增加了实际收入。九江、都昌、湖口等七个县的1，754个社82，451户社员中，增产保产的有78，581户，占总户数的95％。星子县红星高级社增加收入的户数达到100％。这些农业社中，一般社员的收入都比去年增加20％左右，多的达到50％至100％。
    在分配中，各地高级社认真贯彻了“按劳取酬，多劳多得”的分配原则，大大鼓舞了社员的劳动热情。武宁县船滩高级社在预分以后，全社二百五十个男女劳力天天全部出勤。通过分配，许多新社都建立和健全了财务制度。
    新华社汕头5日电　全国著名的水稻高产区潮（安）汕（头）平原的二百多万亩早稻，穗儿开始转黄，再过半个月就可以收割了。
    许多农民告诉记者说，今年早稻生长特别好，出穗齐，无白穗，谷粒饱，至少可以比去年多收一两成。
    记者从汕头专区农业部门了解，今年潮汕平原推行了每亩秧田播种三十斤到五十斤的疏播培育壮秧法，使全部早稻能够实行小株密植。稻禾出穗整齐，穗长粒饱。由于普遍选用良种和采取各种消毒措施，免除了往年三化螟虫为害。中耕期间，各农业社实行浅水勤灌的先进灌溉方法，普遍做到了不烂秧、不倒伏。当早稻扬花的时候，许多农业社的社员深入田间，对一些因迟插而生长较差的禾苗，普遍追施了一次速效肥料。这些禾苗便迅速转壮，赶上好禾。
    现在潮汕平原农民正在纷纷修理农具，迎接丰收。
