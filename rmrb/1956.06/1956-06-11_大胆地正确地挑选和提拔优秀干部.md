    With the rapid development of socialist transformation and socialist construction, the demand for leading cadres in all fields is increasing day by day. Under such circumstances, if we do not take active measures, but only transfer existing leading cadres back and forth, the problem cannot be fundamentally solved. What are the active measures? It is to boldly and correctly select and promote outstanding cadres in all fields, according to the principle of self-reliance, to supplement the ranks of leading cadres. There is no better way than this.
    The facts of the past few months have proved that wherever this work has been carried out seriously in accordance with the above principles, the situation has changed greatly. Taking Beijing as an example, at the beginning of January this year, one-third of the leading positions (chief positions) at all levels in the city were vacant. After the work in the first quarter, a total of more than 2,200 cadres above the section chief level in the district were promoted (about 500 more than the total number promoted throughout last year). By the end of the first quarter, the vacancies in many units had been reduced to about one-tenth, and individual units had no vacancies at all. Boldly promoting outstanding cadres can not only improve the working mechanism and enhance leadership, but also, because the promoted cadres are mostly energetic, have close ties with the masses, are able to study diligently, and are full of creativity, it can bring a new atmosphere to the work.
    This is not to say, of course, that there are no difficulties and problems in the selection and promotion of cadres. The main obstacle in the current work of promoting cadres is the inability to see new forces and the lack of attention to new forces. This and the one-sided emphasis on the "qualifications" of cadres in the selection and promotion of cadres are two sides of the same problem. When discussing whether a cadre can be promoted, many comrades do not specifically study the cadre's political quality and professional ability, but only look at the year the cadre started working, the year he joined the Party, the leading positions he held in the past, and the level (belonging to which salary grade) of the cadre, etc. In this way, many outstanding cadres who have a shorter history of revolutionary struggle but have both ability and integrity are excluded from the scope of selection. Obviously, such a one-sided emphasis on the history of cadres' struggles will produce two results. On the one hand, it will hinder the growth of new cadres, and on the other hand, it may put some incompetent people in important positions. Both of these results are very detrimental to our cause.
    In essence, such erroneous thinking has the following three characteristics: First, this kind of thinking lags behind the revolutionary situation. Comrades with this kind of thinking do not see the new situation of cadre development and progress in recent years, especially the important fact that a large number of new and outstanding cadres have gradually grown up. Second, in the depths of some comrades' minds, there is a backward "hierarchy concept." They divide cadres into several fixed levels and believe that in the promotion of cadres, they can only be ranked layer by layer according to the level, and no transcendence is allowed. Third, this kind of thinking is also a manifestation of the bureaucratic work style. They do not make specific inquiries about cadres in peacetime. When cadres are needed, they take the cadres' resume forms and determine who should do what job based on a few simple items.
    In addition, some Party-member leading cadres, when considering which cadres can be promoted, limit their vision only to Party members, and do not see the outstanding cadres among non-Party members; some Han nationality leading cadres do not pay enough attention to the work of training and promoting minority nationality cadres; some people do not understand the role of intellectual cadres, and even one-sidedly exaggerate their shortcomings, so they cannot give full play to their strength; some people think that women cadres are "troublesome" and even discriminate against them; some leading cadres have too high requirements for cadres, requiring cadres to fully understand everything related to a certain job before taking it, so it is almost impossible to find cadres who can be promoted, and so on.
    In order to correctly select and promote cadres, we must conscientiously implement the Party's policy of selecting cadres based on political quality and professional ability. That is to say, we must select those who have a high degree of socialist consciousness, are able to faithfully implement the Party and the state's lines and policies, have a certain level of education and theoretical level, are familiar with the business or are able to study the business, have close ties with the masses, have a keen sense of new things, and are able to support new forces to serve as various leading positions. Now some units, although they have promoted many cadres, have not seriously examined their political quality and professional ability. Some leading cadres even believe that the promotion of outstanding cadres will affect the "emotions" of other cadres. Therefore, if cadres are to be promoted, the cadres who are almost the same in their original positions should be promoted across the board without selection. Otherwise, none of them should be promoted. This is of course very wrong. In addition, we must profoundly accept the lessons pointed out by the "Three-Anti" movement and the "Purge-Counterrevolutionaries" struggle. Do not let the tendency of neglecting the political quality of cadres and favoritism take the opportunity to raise its head because of the large number of cadres being promoted.
    At the same time, leading organs at all levels must effectively prevent and correct the blindness in the selection and promotion of cadres. Blindness means having no idea in mind and doing things only based on enthusiasm and subjective wishes. In order to prevent blindness, it is necessary to conduct serious investigation and research on the actual needs of cadres and the possibility of promoting cadres; and it is necessary to pay attention to grasping the spirit of streamlining institutions, tightening staffing, and saving manpower. Now in some places, a phenomenon of excessive demands, impatience, only asking for quantity but not quality, and blindly expanding institutions has emerged in the work of promoting cadres. This tendency must also be corrected.
    At present, in different regions and work departments, tens of thousands of outstanding cadres will be promoted to more important work positions. The quality of this work will have a direct impact on our socialist cause. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must strengthen their specific guidance to this work, conduct timely inspections, discover problems, and sum up experience, and should never let it drift.

### 大胆地正确地挑选和提拔优秀干部

    大胆地正确地挑选和提拔优秀干部
    随着社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，各方面所需要的领导干部一天比一天多。在这样的情况下，如果不采取积极的办法，而只是把原有的领导干部调来调去，就不能从根本上解决问题。积极的办法是什么呢？就是根据自力更生的原则，大胆地正确地挑选和提拔各个方面的优秀干部，来补充领导干部的队伍。除此以外，再没有其他更好的办法。
    最近几个月来的事实证明，凡是按照以上的原则认真进行了这一工作的地方，情况都有了很大的改变。以北京市为例，在今年一月初，全市各级领导职务（正职）中，有三分之一缺额。经过第一季度的工作，共提拔了区级科长以上的干部二千二百多名（比去年全年提拔的总数还要多五百人左右），到第一季度末，很多单位的缺额已经减少到十分之一左右，个别单位已经没有了缺额。大胆地提拔优秀干部，不仅可以健全工作机构，增强领导力量，而且由于所提拔起来的干部，大多是朝气蓬勃，同群众有密切联系，能够刻苦钻研，并且富于创造性的人，因而可以使工作出现一种新的气象。
    这当然不是说，在挑选和提拔干部的工作中，已经没有什么困难和问题。当前提拔干部工作中的主要障碍，是看不见新生力量，对新生力量不重视。这和在挑选和提拔干部中片面地强调干部的“资历”的思想，是同一个问题的两个方面。有不少同志，在谈到某一个干部可以不可以提拔的时候，并不去具体地研究这个干部的政治品质和业务能力，而只是看这个干部是哪一年参加工作的，哪一年入党的，过去担任过哪些领导职务，是哪一级（属于哪一种工资等级）的干部等等。这样，就把很多的虽然革命斗争历史较短但是德才兼备的优秀干部放到选拔的范围之外。显然，这样片面地强调干部的斗争历史，会产生两种结果，一方面是妨害新干部的成长，另一方面也可能把某些不称职的人放到重要的工作岗位上去。这两种结果，对我们的事业都是非常不利的。
    这样的错误思想，就其实质来看有以下三方面的特点：第一，这种思想落后于革命的形势。有这种思想的同志看不见最近若干年内干部发展进步的新情况，特别是看不见一大批新的优秀的干部已经逐渐成长起来这样一个重要的事实。第二，在某些同志的思想深处，存在着一种落后的“等级观点”。他们把干部分成了若干个固定的等级，并且认为在提拔干部的时候，只能按照等级一层一层地排下去，不允许有所逾越。第三，这种思想又是官僚主义的思想作风的一种表现。平素对干部不去进行具体了解，到了需要干部的时候，把干部的简历表拿来，根据几个简单的项目就确定了哪个人该做什么工作。
    除此以外，还有一些党员领导干部，在考虑哪些干部可以提拔的时候，把眼光只是限制在党员身上，而看不见非党员中的优秀干部；有些汉族领导干部，对培养和提拔少数民族干部的工作注意不够；有些人不了解知识分子干部的作用，甚至片面地夸大他们的缺点，因而不能充分发挥他们的力量；有些人认为妇女干部“麻烦”，甚至加以歧视；有些领导干部对干部的要求过高，要求干部在担任某种职务以前就完全懂得与这一工作有关的一切事情，因而几乎找不到可以提拔的干部，等等。
    为了正确地挑选提拔干部，必须认真地执行党的根据政治品质和业务能力挑选干部的政策。这就是说，必须挑选那些具有高度的社会主义觉悟、能够忠实地执行党和国家的路线和政策、有一定的文化程度和理论水平、熟悉业务或能够钻研业务、同群众有密切的联系、对新鲜事物有锐敏的感觉和能够支持新生力量的人，来担任各种领导职务。现在有些单位，虽然已经提拔了不少的干部，但是并没有去认真地考察他们的政治品质和业务能力。甚至有的领导干部认为，提拔优秀干部，就会影响其他干部的“情绪”。因此，要提拔干部的话，就应该把原来职务差不多的干部，不加选择地一律提拔起来。否则，就一律不要提拔。这当然是非常错误的。此外，还必须深刻地接受“三反”运动和“肃反”斗争所指出的教训。不要因为大量地提拔干部，而使忽视干部政治品质和任人唯亲的偏向乘机抬头。
    同时，各级领导机关还必须切实地防止和纠正挑选提拔干部工作中的盲目性。盲目性就是心中无数，只凭热情和主观愿望办事。为了防止盲目性，必须对需要干部和提拔干部的实际可能性这两方面的情况进行认真的调查研究；并且必须注意掌握精简机构、紧缩编制、节省人力的精神。现在有些地方，在提拔干部的工作中已经出现了一种要求过高，过急，只问数量，不问质量和盲目地扩大机构的现象。这种偏向也一定要加以纠正。
    目前，在不同的地区和工作部门中，将要有成千成万个优秀的干部，被提拔到更加重要的工作岗位上来。这一工作的好坏，对于我们的社会主义事业将要发生直接的影响。因此，各级党委必须加强对这一工作的具体指导，及时地进行检查，发现问题，总结经验，而绝不应该任其自流。
