    (Reported by this newspaper) Hainan Island has recently discovered another hemp rope (locally known as Ge Suan Teng) with high economic value. This is a wild plant distributed in the mountainous areas of Tunchang, Chengmai, Danxian, Wanning, and Lehui counties. This crop contains abundant latex and can be used to manufacture rubber shoes, nipples, and other rubber products.
