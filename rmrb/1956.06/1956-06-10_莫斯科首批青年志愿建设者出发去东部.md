Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. On June 3rd, Yaroslavsky Station in Moscow was especially lively as the first group of young patriots, responding to the call of the Communist Party and the government, were about to depart from there to participate in construction work in Siberia and the Far East. Thousands of Muscovites came to see them off.

Buses carrying the young patriots arrived at the station one after another. The band played music, and people sang heroic Communist Youth League songs.

Before the young patriots boarded the train, a rally was held at the station. Pavlov, Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, warmly congratulated them and wished them success in their new jobs. Electric welder Karachev, representing all the young people going east to participate in construction, guaranteed that they would gloriously fulfill the trust the motherland had placed in them.

It was almost time to leave. At this moment, touching farewell scenes appeared on the platform. Hundreds of hands holding lilac bouquets and flowers waved outside the train's windows. The singing never stopped, and people danced on the platform.

A long whistle sounded from the electric train. The first train carrying the capital's youth slowly left the station, and the people seeing them off shouted, "Bon voyage!"

    莫斯科首批青年志愿建设者出发去东部
    新华社莫斯科讯　六月三日，莫斯科雅罗斯拉夫车站显得特别热闹，响应共产党和政府的号召去西伯利亚和远东参加建设工作的第一批青年爱国者就要从那里出发了。有成千上万的莫斯科人前来欢送他们。
    载着青年爱国者的汽车陆续来到车站。乐队奏起了乐曲，人们唱着雄壮的共青团歌曲。
    在青年爱国者上火车以前，车站上举行了集会。苏联列宁共产主义青年团莫斯科市委员会书记巴夫洛夫，向他们热烈祝贺，祝他们在新的工作岗位上获得成就。电焊工人卡拉切夫代表全体去东方参加建设的青年人保证说，他们将光荣地实现祖国对他们的信托。
    快要出发了。这时候，月台上出现了动人的告别场面。几百只拿着紫丁香花束和鲜花的手在车厢的玻璃窗外挥动。歌声一直没有停止，人们在月台上跳起舞来。
    电气火车的一声长长的汽笛响了。载着首都青年的第一趟列车徐徐离站，送行的人大声地说：“一路平安！”
