    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model regulations for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    In Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report, it was mentioned:
    "Calculating from the entire industrial production, the total industrial output value in 1956 will reach the production level originally planned for 1957 in the Five-Year Plan." It also stated that grain production in 1956 would exceed the level originally planned for 1957 in the Five-Year Plan by 13.3 billion jin, and cotton production in 1956 would exceed the level originally planned for 1957 in the Five-Year Plan by 2.86 million dan. These early and exceeded completion figures are exciting.
    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total number of students in primary and higher primary schools in early 1957 should reach about 60.23 million; Vice Premier Li told us in his report that the number of primary school students in 1956 would reach more than 62 million. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total number of students in high schools and junior high schools in 1957 should reach 4.707 million; Vice Premier Li mentioned that the number of students in ordinary middle schools in 1956 would reach 5.06 million. The Five-Year Plan also stipulates that the total number of students in secondary specialized schools in 1957 should reach 671,800; Vice Premier Li's report pointed out that the number of students in secondary specialized schools in 1956 would reach 801,000. These are also some exciting early and exceeded completion figures.
    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total number of students in universities and colleges in 1957 should reach 434,600; the report mentioned that the number of students in universities and colleges in 1956 would reach 380,000. Although this number did not reach the 1957 standard, it has reached twice the number of students in 1952. The reason for not reaching the standard is that the number of high school graduates each year in the past few years has not been enough to meet the needs of universities and colleges for enrollment. So this is the difficulty left to us by the old society. Minister Zhang Xiruo said in his speech that this difficulty could be overcome by 1959.
    The 1956 budget stipulates that expenditures on cultural and educational undertakings account for 12.74% of this year's budget expenditures. This proportion is quite large; there would never have been such a large cultural and educational expenditure in the old society.
    I am a cultural and educational worker. When I saw the vigorous development of the country's various undertakings, especially the rapid development of cultural and educational undertakings, from the budget, I deeply felt that the great cause of building a socialist society will surely be realized ahead of schedule under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China.
    Difficulties and Shortcomings in Cultural and Educational Work
    Our work has achievements, and this is the main aspect. However, in the process of advancement, difficulties and shortcomings are inevitable.
    At present, both in economic construction and in cultural and educational construction, there is a feeling of a lack of talent. As a cultural and educational worker, I feel that the responsibility is significant and glorious. I wish I could do the work of two people to cultivate more talents who are loyal to the motherland and loyal to the cause of socialism with modern scientific knowledge for the country.
    In the past few years, the treatment of primary school teachers was too low. Some female teachers went to class holding a child in their arms, carrying one on their back, and leading two children. After arriving at school, they handed the two younger ones to a temporary nursery, and the two older ones had to wander around in the corridor or the yard. Therefore, the children of educators were not being educated. Some male teachers' monthly income was not enough to maintain the minimum living standard of their families. How can these teachers be able to work with peace of mind and improve their teaching? Vice Premier Li said that the wages of all employees across the country will be increased, and the wages of rural primary school teachers will also be increased at the same time. Minister Zhang Xiruo said that the average salary of primary school teachers will be increased by 32.88% after the adjustment, which is great.
    At present, the health of middle school students is not good. In some areas, more than 10% of middle school students suffer from tuberculosis, high blood pressure, headaches, and neurasthenia; the number of people suffering from night blindness is even higher. One reason is that students have too heavy a study burden, and they cannot or are unwilling to rest on Sundays; another reason is malnutrition. Therefore, after graduating from high school, they often cannot get into university due to poor health. Some enter university, but then suspend or drop out due to poor health. Therefore, improving the middle school curriculum and improving the nutrition of middle school students to improve the health level of developing youth is an important issue in current middle school education.
    In addition, middle school teachers also have a heavy burden. They teach about 20 hours a week and are busy with classes, tutoring, and grading papers every day. If they also serve as class teachers or participate in some social activities, they will not even have much time to prepare lessons. How can this improve the teaching effect? This is also one of the reasons why students have a heavy study burden. The vast majority of middle school teachers now have not attended or completed university. Their level is low, and they have no conditions to improve, which affects the quality of teaching.
    In higher education, most university teachers are now busy writing lecture notes, so they have no time to conduct scientific research. Therefore, how to organize manpower to write university textbooks is also an important issue.
    In universities and colleges, attention should also be paid to improving teaching methods. There are also teachers who only read lecture notes in the classroom and cannot vividly explain; students are only busy writing notes and have no time to understand and comprehend. Therefore, the phenomenon of students taking notes in class, comparing notes after class, and memorizing notes before exams has formed. This teaching method cannot achieve the desired effect.
    A university once scheduled students' extracurricular study time rigidly. During the time for self-study of physics, everyone in the classroom must have the textbook or notes of the physics course in front of them. If you finish self-studying this course early and want to read other courses or read in the library during this time, it is called unorganized and undisciplined. This mechanical learning method is harmful and useless. This university has now stopped this learning method, but are there other universities that are implementing similar methods? University students' extracurricular study time should be completely at the disposal of the students themselves.
    The Party and the government's policy on improving the working conditions of senior intellectuals is correct. However, a few days ago, I saw in the China Youth Daily that a certain university still requires teachers to sit at work during normal times, be on duty on Sundays, and even divide into sections and sections to clean the yard and toilets. Whenever teachers and students mention scientific research work, the school leaders get angry. I don't know if this is the only way of leadership in this university.
    I wholeheartedly agree with the Party and the government's call to march towards science. I am a person with quite a few part-time jobs. However, due to the implementation of improving the working conditions of senior intellectuals, in the past five months or so, I concentrated on writing a textbook "Number Theory" for the mathematics department of a university and two mathematical papers. These two papers have been sent to the editorial department of the Chinese Journal of Mathematics. I should first of all thank the Party and the government for their encouragement and support for me to have such a little scientific research achievement. I should continue to work hard in the future and should encourage more people to work hard together. But have the working conditions of all senior intellectuals been improved? Have their expertise been brought into play? As can be seen from the previous example of getting angry, this is indeed a question worth investigating and studying.
    In developing scientific research, in addition to adding experimental equipment, libraries and complete sets of magazines, especially complete sets of old magazines, should also be added. I suggest that the Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Education should systematically photocopy the few good books and complete sets of old magazines that are available in only a few units and distribute them to all research institutions and universities. We want to catch up with the world level. If we cannot check what already exists at or below the world level, how can we do it?
    Two Issues Seen During Inspection
    Secondly, I want to talk about two issues I saw during my inspection work:
    First, the cultural and technical level of employees is low. I inspected a metrology factory. The weighing instruments produced by this factory only had specifications until recently. In previous years, the parts of this product could not be matched to another product, and people called these parts "seat-specific" parts. Weighing instruments are the standard for measuring other items, but the weighing instruments themselves do not have a certain standard. The reason for this is that the cultural and technical level of employees is low. Some workers are still illiterate, and some technicians cannot read drawings. The size, thickness, length, and thickness of product parts are all estimated. How can this be accurate? Due to the low cultural and technical level of employees, it is also difficult for them to put forward better rationalization proposals. Therefore, the cultural and technical level of employees should indeed be greatly improved.
    Secondly, during the inspection process, I heard that everyone was clamoring for a lack of housing. This is indeed an urgent problem to be solved. In addition to the normal solution, I suggest building more simple houses in cities or factories and mines where land is not a problem, without using reinforced concrete, only using bricks, tiles, and wood. Employees with conditions can be encouraged to build houses at their own expense, or the trade union welfare funds can be used to help employees build houses, which can be deducted from employees' wages in installments. After a few years, the house can belong to the employee. The refunded housing fee can be used to build new houses year by year. I am not sure whether employee welfare funds can be used to build houses for employees. However, during the inspection work, I heard that some units had a lot of welfare funds left over at the end of the year and handed them over to the state. I think it is not the intention of the Party and the government to not solve difficulties and save money without doing things.
    Today's People's Daily editorial pointed out that bonuses can be used to build houses for employees, which I strongly agree with.

### 为国家培养更多的人才——张德馨代表的发言

    为国家培养更多的人才
    ——张德馨代表的发言
    我完全拥护李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明和彭真副委员长兼秘书长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    在李先念副总理的报告里曾经提到：
  “从整个工业生产计算，1956年的工业总产值也将达到五年计划原定1957年的生产水平。”又说1956年的粮食产量将比五年计划原定1957年的水平超过133亿斤，1956年的棉花产量将比五年计划原定1957年的水平超过286万担。这些提前和超额完成的数字是令人兴奋的。
    五年计划内规定1957年初小和高小的在校学生数共达6，023万人左右；李副总理在报告中曾经告诉我们，1956年的小学在校学生数将达到6，200万人以上。五年计划内规定1957年高中和初中的在校学生数共达470.7万人；李副总理曾经提到，1956年的普通中学在校学生数将达到506万人。五年计划内又规定1957年中等专业学校在校学生数共达67.18万人；李副总理的报告指出1956年中等专业学校在校学生数将达到80.1万人。这又是一些令人欢欣鼓舞的提前和超额完成的数字。
    五年计划内规定1957年高等学校学生数共达43.46万人；而在报告中曾提到，1956年高等学校在校学生数将达38万人。这个数字虽然没达到1957年的标准，但已达到了1952年的在校学生数的两倍了。没能达到的原因是，以往几年内每年的高中毕业生都不够高等学校招生的需要。所以这是旧社会给我们留下的困难。张奚若部长在发言中谈到，这个困难到1959年就可克服掉。
    1956年的预算规定了文教事业支出占本年预算支出的12.74％。这个比例数是相当大的，在旧社会里决不会有这么大的文教费。
    我是一个文教工作者。当我由预算中看到国家各项事业的蓬勃发展情况，尤其是文教事业的飞跃发展，我深深地感到，建设社会主义社会的伟大事业，在中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的正确领导下，一定会提前实现。
    文教工作中存在的困难和缺点
    我们的工作是有成绩的，这是主要的方面。但在前进的过程中，当然也免不了有困难和缺点。
    目前无论在经济建设中或在文教建设中，都感到人才的缺乏。作为一个文教工作者，我感到责任是重大和光荣的。我恨不能一个人作两个人的工作，来为国家培养更多的忠实于祖国、忠实于社会主义事业的具有现代科学知识的人才。
    以往几年小学教员待遇太低。有的女教员抱着一个小孩，背着一个小孩，领着两个小孩去上课。到校后把两个小的交到临时托儿所，两个大的只好在走廊或院内街上随便游逛了。因此形成教育工作者的孩子没人教育。有的男教员每月收入不够维持家庭的最低生活。这怎么能使这些为人师的安心工作、提高教学呢？李副总理说，全国职工的工资都将提高，乡村小学教师的工资也将同时加以提高。张奚若部长说，调整后小学教员的平均工资将提高32.88％，这太好了。
    现在中学生的健康情况不好。有些地区的中学生患肺结核、高血压、头痛和神经衰弱等症者超过10％；患夜盲症者尚不止此数。原因的一方面是学生学习负担过重，星期天都不能休息或不肯休息；另一方面营养不良也是一个原因。因此，高中毕业后，常因健康情况不好而不能考进大学。有的进入大学后，又因健康情况不好而中途休学或退学。所以改进中学课程和改善中学生营养，以提高正在发育的青年的健康水平，是当前中学教育中的一个重要问题。
    此外，中学教师的负担也有些重。每周任课20小时左右，每天忙于上课、辅导、改本子。若再担任班主任或参加些社会活动，就连备课的时间也不多了。这怎么能提高教学效果呢？这也是造成学生学习负担重的原因之一。现在的中学教师，绝大多数是没上过大学或没读完大学的。他们的水平低，而又没有条件提高，这对于教学质量是有影响的。
    在高等教育中，现在多数的大学教师忙于写讲义，因此无暇进行科学研究。所以怎样组织人力编写大学的教材，也是一个重要的问题。
    在高等学校里也应该注意改进教学方法。还有这样的教师，他在讲堂上只是念讲稿，不能生动地发挥；学生就只忙着写笔记，根本顾不上去理解、体会。因此，形成了学生上课抄笔记，下课对笔记，考试前背笔记的现象。这种教学方法是得不到应有的效果的。
    有个高等学校曾经把学生的课外学习时间编排得死板板的。在自习物理的时间，大家在教室里都必须在面前摆着物理课的教材或笔记。若早自习完了这门课，在这个时间内想看别的课，或到图书馆阅读，那就叫无组织无纪律。这种机械的学习方法是有损无益的。这个高等学校现已停止了这个学习方法，可是是否还有其它的高等学校在实行这样类似的方法呢？大学生的课外学习时间，应该完全由学生个人自由支配。
    党和政府关于改善高级知识分子工作条件的政策是正确的。可是前些日子看到中国青年报载有某个高等学校，还要求教师平时坐班、星期天值班、并且还得分片、分段打扫院子和厕所。师生一提到科学研究工作，学校领导同志就要冒火。这样的领导方式，也不知是否就是这一所高等学校。
    党和政府的向科学进军的号召，我是双手赞成的。我是个兼职相当多的人。可是由于实施改善高级知识分子工作条件的结果，在以往的五个多月内，我集中精力地写了一本大学数学系用的教本“整数论”和两篇数学论文。这两篇论文，已经寄到中国数学学报编辑部去了。我能够有这么一点科学研究成果，首先应该感谢党和政府给我的鼓励和支持。我今后应该继续努力，并应带动更多的人共同努力。可是是否所有的高级知识分子的工作条件都得到了改善呢？他们的专长是否都得到了发挥呢？由于前边冒火的例子可知，这确实是个值得考察研究的问题。
    在开展科学研究方面，除应增添实验设备外，还应添设图书和成套的杂志，尤其是成套的旧杂志。我建议科学院、高等教育部和教育部，应该有计划地把少数单位仅有的好的图书和成套的旧杂志都影印出来、分送给所有的研究机关和高等学校。我们要赶上世界水平。如果在世界水平线上或线下，已有的东西我们都无法查考，这怎么能行呢。
    在视察中看到的两个问题
    其次，我要谈谈我在视察工作中看到的两个问题：
    第一、职工的文化技术水平低。我曾视察了一个度量衡工厂。这个工厂出产的衡具，一直到最近不久才有规格。往年这个产品的零件不能配到另一个产品上，人们叫这些配件为“对号入座”的配件。想衡具乃是衡量其它物品的标准，而衡具本身反倒没有一定的标准。推其原因都是职工文化技术水平低的缘故。有的工人还是文盲，有的技术员不会看图。产品配件的大小、粗细、长短、厚薄都是靠估量。这怎么能准确呢？由于职工的文化技术水平低，也使得他们很难提出更好的合理化建议。所以职工的文化技术水平确实应大力提高。
    其次，在视察过程中我听到，到处都在叫喊缺少住房。这确实是急需解决的问题。除去正常的解决办法外，我建议在地皮不成问题的城市或厂矿里，多建造比较简易的住宅，不用钢筋水泥，只用砖瓦土木。可鼓励有条件的职工自费盖房，也可用工会福利费协助职工盖房，分期由职工的工资中扣还。几年后，该房就可归职工所有。利用扣还的房费又可逐年建造新住房。可否动用职工福利费为职工盖房我不清楚。但在视察工作中，我听到有些单位到了年终剩下了很多福利费，上交国家了。我想有困难不解决，省钱不办事，这不是党和政府的意图。
    今天人民日报的社论指出，可动用奖励金为职工盖房，我是非常地赞成的。
