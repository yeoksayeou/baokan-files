Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, June 24th: The Algerian Communist Party and the Algerian National Liberation Front are protesting the French authorities' execution of two Algerian patriots.

    These two patriots were executed on June 19th after being sentenced to death by the Algiers court. This is the first time since the Algerian people launched an armed uprising that the French authorities have openly executed Algerian patriots using the courts.

    The Algerian Communist Party distributed pamphlets on June 22nd, calling on the Algerian people to hold demonstrations, strikes, market boycotts, and school strikes to protest the execution of Algerian patriots.

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 22nd: Since June 19th, more than 3,000 French troops have launched a military offensive against the Algerian People's Armed Forces in the coastal area 25 miles west of Oran in western Algeria. The French troops involved include air force, navy, and armored units.

    The fighting is intense in the Lourmel-Sidi-Bakhti and Bou Zajar triangle area. Agence France-Presse reported on the 20th that the French army's "progress is slow because the war zone is rugged."

    In the Nementcha Mountains in eastern Algeria, French troops are also fighting against the People's Armed Forces.

    The French government is continuously deploying troops to Algeria for military suppression. According to French Defense Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury at a luncheon of the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris on the 20th, France plans to increase its troops stationed in Algeria to 500,000 by next year.

    Bourgès-Maunoury said that the current French troops in Algeria have reached 400,000, which accounts for more than half of the French armed forces, excluding reserves.

    Bourgès-Maunoury admitted that despite the large number of troops in Algeria, military action against the Algerian people's uprising armed forces would be "long and slow."

    抗议法国当局在阿尔及利亚的暴行
    法军又在阿尔及利亚西部向人民武装发动攻势
    新华社24日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚共产党和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线抗议法国当局处死两个阿尔及利亚爱国者。
    这两个爱国者在被阿尔及尔法庭判处死刑以后，在六月十九日被杀害了。在阿尔及利亚人民发动武装起义以来，法国当局利用法庭公然处决阿尔及利亚爱国者，这还是第一次。
    阿尔及利亚共产党在六月二十二日散发小册子，号召阿尔及利亚人民举行示威，罢工、罢市和罢课，抗议这次处决阿尔及利亚爱国者的事件。
    新华社22日讯　巴黎消息：法军三千多人六月十九日开始在阿尔及利亚西部阿兰以西二十五英里的海岸区，向阿尔及利亚人民武装部队发动军事进攻。出动的法军中包括空军、海军和装甲部队。
    战事正在卢尔梅尔—西迪—巴克蒂和布扎贾尔三角地区激烈进行，法新社二十日消息说：法军“进展缓慢，因为战区崎岖不平”。
    在阿尔及利亚东部的内门特查山区，法军也在同人民武装部队作战。
    法国政府正在不断调军队到阿尔及利亚来进行军事镇压，据法国国防部长布歇—莫努里二十日在巴黎英美记者协会的午餐会上说，法国准备到明年把驻阿尔及利亚的军队增加到五十万人。
    布歇—莫努里说，目前在阿尔及利亚的法军已经达到四十万人，这占除了后备队以外的法国武装部队一半以上。
    布歇—莫努里承认，尽管有大量军队在阿尔及利亚，但是对阿尔及利亚人民起义武装部队的军事行动将是“长期缓慢”的。
