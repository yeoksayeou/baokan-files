Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd dispatch: According to TASS, the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks have caused confusion, unease, and even annoyance among U.S. officials and many newspaper commentators.

According to a Reuters correspondent in Washington, "A U.S. State Department spokesman adopted a cautious attitude towards the statement of 'strengthened cooperation' between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and was in a state of confusion."

The correspondent said that U.S. government officials believed that Yugoslavia's position on the German question and the recognition of the People's Republic of China was "unexpectedly tough."

An editorial in "The New York Times," commenting on the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks, believed that the Soviet-Yugoslav statement contained "disturbing elements." The newspaper believed that one of the "disturbing elements" was that it was now "more difficult to distinguish the positions of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union on foreign policy issues."

The newspaper also expressed great dissatisfaction with the decision of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to further cooperate.

Many newspapers and politicians, dissatisfied with Yugoslavia's independent policy, demanded that the United States stop aid to Yugoslavia. An editorial in the New York "American Journal" demanded the cessation of "any aid" to Yugoslavia and the use of "savings from here" to further strengthen the U.S. Air Force.

According to UPI, Senator McCarthy submitted a statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee requesting that the committee stop "any aid" to Yugoslavia. McCarthy said in the statement: "The reconciliation between Moscow and Belgrade is a serious failure for the United States." He was indignant that: "Yugoslavia has formed a united front with the Soviet Union in all decisive diplomatic struggles."

    美国官方嫉视苏南友好关系的发展
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏南会谈结果在美国官方人士和许多报纸评论员中引起了混乱、不安甚至恼怒。
    据路透社驻华盛顿记者报道，“美国国务院发言人对南斯拉夫和苏联‘加强合作’的声明持慎重的态度，而且心情是混乱的。”
    这位记者说，美国政府人士认为南斯拉夫在德国问题和承认中华人民共和国的权利的问题上的立场是“出乎意外地强硬”。
      “纽约时报”的社论在评论苏南会谈结果的时候认为，苏联和南斯拉夫的声明包含有“令人不安的成分”。报纸认为“令人不安的成分”之一就是，现在“更加难以区别南斯拉夫和苏联在外交政策问题上的立场了”。
    这家报纸还对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和苏联共产党进一步合作的决定表示非常不满。
    许多对南斯拉夫的独立政策感到不满的报纸和政界人士，要求美国停止对南斯拉夫的援助。纽约“美国人日报”的社论要求停止对南斯拉夫的“任何援助”，并且利用“从这里节省下来的费用”来进一步加强美国空军。
    据合众社报道，参议员麦卡锡向参议院外交委员会提出一个声明，要求委员会停止对南斯拉夫的“任何援助”。麦卡锡在这个声明中说：“莫斯科和贝尔格莱德之间的和解是美国的一个严重的失败”。他感到愤怒的是：“南斯拉夫在一切决定性的外交斗争中同苏联结成一条战线。”
