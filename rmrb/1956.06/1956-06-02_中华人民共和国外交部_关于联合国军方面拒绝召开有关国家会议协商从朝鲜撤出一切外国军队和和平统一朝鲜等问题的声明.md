The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
Statement on the Refusal of the United Nations Command to Convene a Conference of Relevant Countries to Discuss the Withdrawal of All Foreign Troops from Korea and the Peaceful Reunification of Korea
June 1, 1956
The Chinese government, in its own name and on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, suggested to the British government on April 9, 1956, and through the British government, to the governments of other countries on the United Nations Command side, that a conference of relevant countries be convened to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. This was another effort by the Korean and Chinese sides to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. However, in its reply to the Chinese government on May 28, 1956, the British government, representing the governments of various countries on the United Nations Command side, rejected this constructive proposal by the Chinese and Korean governments. We cannot but express great regret over this.

The proposal by the Chinese and Korean governments to convene a conference of relevant countries did not set any preconditions. Obviously, this proposal, which is fair to both sides of the Korean armistice, should have received a positive response from the governments of the United Nations Command side. However, the United States and other governments on the United Nations Command side put forward the precondition that the Chinese and Korean sides must accept the so-called United Nations objectives. Everyone knows that the so-called United Nations objectives are not the objectives of the United Nations Charter, but only the one-sided preconditions put forward by the United Nations Command side in the 1954 Geneva Conference, which the Chinese and Korean sides cannot accept. If the United States and other countries on the United Nations Command side insist on doing so, it can only show that they do not want to withdraw their troops from Korea at all and are fundamentally opposed to the Korean people realizing their desire to unify their country.

Due to the obstruction of the United States and other countries on the United Nations Command side, the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea, especially the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, has not been resolved for a long time. This naturally creates certain practical difficulties for the neutral countries participating in the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, in its reply to the Chinese government on May 28, 1956, the United Nations Command side reversed right and wrong, accusing the Chinese and Korean sides of obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and slandering the Chinese and Korean sides for transporting reinforcements of military personnel and materials from outside Korea. These accusations and slanders are completely unfounded. The fact is exactly the opposite. The Chinese and Korean sides have always strictly abided by the armistice agreement and given full cooperation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, while it is the United States government that has violated the armistice agreement by equipping the Lee Seung-man group's army with a large number of reinforcements of weapons and equipment, and has done everything possible to obstruct the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. It is well known that, with the connivance of the United States government, the Lee Seung-man group has subjected the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to various insults and even violence. It is obvious that the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in supervising the armistice, especially the work of the inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in southern ports, has increasingly become an obstacle to the United States government and the Lee Seung-man group in further undermining the armistice agreement. It is only for this reason that the United Nations Command side contradicts itself in its note, claiming on the one hand to support the Korean armistice agreement, and on the other hand publicly stating that the activities carried out by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea in accordance to the armistice agreement is a “burden” to the United States. People have to ask, if the United States truly wishes to “strive to maintain the effectiveness of the armistice,” why does it go to great lengths to weaken or limit the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission?

It is very clear that the refusal of the United States government and other governments on the United Nations Command side to accept the proposal of the Chinese and Korean governments to convene a conference of relevant countries not only hinders the early resolution of the Korean issue and prevents the situation in the Far East from further easing, but also inevitably increases the difficulties of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The United States and other relevant governments must bear full responsibility for this. The Chinese government's position on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the realization of Korean unification through free national elections will not be changed by this. The Chinese government will continue to work with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to peacefully unify Korea and ease international tensions.

Note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China to the Office of the British Chargé d'Affaires in China on April 9

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China presents its compliments to the Office of the British Chargé d'Affaires in China and requests that the following matters be conveyed to the Government of the United Kingdom.

1.  The Governments of Sweden and Switzerland have repeatedly stated to the Chinese Government the practical difficulties they have encountered in their work in the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and have expressed the hope that they can be resolved. The Chinese Government has always sympathized with the situation of the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland and has continuously striven to find ways to alleviate their difficulties. Recently, the Swedish Government again suggested that all six neutral inspection teams currently stationed at specific ports in North and South Korea be temporarily withdrawn, and that inspection teams be dispatched temporarily only when necessary; the Swiss Government suggested that the existing neutral inspection teams at the six specific ports be completely abolished and that only mobile inspection teams be retained. The Chinese Government believes that the practical difficulties repeatedly raised by the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland can only be fundamentally resolved if the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea, and first and foremost the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, is resolved.

2.  Since the conference on the Korean issue held in Geneva in 1954, the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently advocated convening a conference of relevant countries to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese Government also believes that as long as all parties concerned have a sincere desire to seek a solution, these issues can be resolved reasonably.

3.  Based on the above considerations, the Chinese Government, in its own name and on behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, suggests to the Government of the United Kingdom, and through the Government of the United Kingdom, to the governments of other countries on the United Nations Command side, that a conference of relevant countries be convened to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Korean Government and the Chinese Government request the Government of the United Kingdom to convey this suggestion to the governments of other countries on the United Nations Command side. The Korean Government and the Chinese Government hope that the Government of the United Kingdom and the governments of other countries on the United Nations Command side will give positive consideration to this suggestion and reply as soon as possible.
    This note,

    To the Office of the British Chargé d'Affaires in China
      (Seal) Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                  April 9, 1956, in Beijing

                Attachment 2
    Reply Note from the Office of the British Chargé d'Affaires in China on May 28

    To His Excellency Mr. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Beijing:

    Your Excellency,

    I am instructed by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to reply to Your Excellency's Note No. Bu Yan Zi 9 of April 9, 1956, in which you mentioned the difficulties of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and suggested holding a conference to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and the unification of Korea.

    The Government of Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom, in accordance with the request in Your Excellency's Note of April 9, has forwarded that Note to the governments of other countries participating in the United Nations Command, and after consultations, they have requested the Government of Her Majesty the Queen to respond on their behalf.

    For a long time, the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command have believed that the fundamental problem in Korea is that the Korean people's hope to unify their country has been frustrated. In Geneva, they explained in detail their position on a just solution to this problem in accordance with the objectives of the United Nations. At the last two sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, this position was reiterated, and the vast majority of United Nations member states agreed with this position.

    As for the suggestion by the People's Republic of China and the North Korean regime to hold a conference to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops and the issue of unification, the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command do not see any change in the position of the People's Republic of China and the North Korean regime that would allow such a conference to be fruitful. The governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command remain ready to discuss the issue of unification at any time on the basis of the objectives of the United Nations. If the People's Republic of China and the North Korean regime have specific suggestions for resolving the Korean issue in accordance with the objectives of the United Nations, the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command are prepared to give all consideration to such suggestions.

    In the event that the People's Republic of China and the North Korean regime are unwilling to negotiate on the basis of the objectives of the United Nations, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can and should be separated from the issue of unification. Until an agreement is reached on the issue of unification, the armistice agreement will remain in effect in Korea, and all parties concerned should strive to maintain the effectiveness of the armistice and correct the problems related to the armistice that have occurred. The governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command wish to reiterate their support for the armistice agreement and their intention to contribute to peace in the region.

    The governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command cannot accept the statement in the Note of April 9, 1956, that the People's Republic of China and the North Korean regime have "continuously striven to alleviate" the difficulties encountered by the Swedish and Swiss governments in the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, because these difficulties are in fact caused by the actions of China and North Korea themselves. The suggestions of the Swiss and Swedish governments mentioned in the Note of April 9 became necessary (the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command believe that these suggestions are reasonable and give them full support) because China and North Korea have adopted a policy of systematically obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission since the initial signing of the armistice agreement. China and North Korea have consistently transported military personnel and materials into Korea through ports other than those stipulated in the armistice agreement and have not reported these imports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Due to the obstruction of the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, accusations by the United Nations Command regarding these imports have been effectively prevented from being investigated. In short, China and North Korea have completely obstructed any effective supervision by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in areas north of the demilitarized zone. In this situation, the activities of the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission south of the demilitarized zone are an unfair burden to the United Nations Command side. The United Nations Command will fully announce its position on this issue in the Military Armistice Commission.

    In view of the above, and taking into account the attitude shown by China and North Korea in actual practice regarding its obligations to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command believe that there is no sign of any sincerity, and only sincerity can make any new conference achieve useful results. The governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Command believe that until China and North Korea are prepared to negotiate in good faith on the basis of the objectives of the United Nations, another conference can only lead to a repeat of the stalemate that occurred in Geneva in 1954.

    Please accept, Your Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.
                (Signed) O'Nianru
                    May 28, 1956

    关于联合国军方面拒绝召开有关国家会议协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜等问题的声明
    1956年6月1日
    中国政府曾经以自己的名义，并且受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，在1956年4月9日向英国政府，并且通过英国政府，向联合国军方面其它各国政府建议召开一个有关国家的会议，协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜等问题。这是朝中方面为了和平解决朝鲜问题而作的又一次努力。但是，1956年5月28日英国政府代表联合国军方面的各国政府给予中国政府的答复中，竟然拒绝了中朝两国政府的这一建设性的建议。对此，我们不能不表示很大的遗憾。
    中朝两国政府关于召开有关国家会议的建议，并没有提出任何先决条件。很显然这一对于朝鲜停战双方都很公平的建议是应该得到联合国军方面各国政府有利的反应的。但是，联合国军方面的美国和其他各国政府竟然提出了朝中方面必须接受所谓联合国目标的先决条件，而大家都知道所谓联合国目标绝不是联合国宪章的目标，而只是美国纠合其他国家在1954年日内瓦会议中提出的联合国军方面的片面的先决条件，这当然是不可能为朝中方面所接受的。美国和联合国军方面的其他国家如果坚持这样做，只能表明他们根本不想从朝鲜撤退自己的军队，根本反对朝鲜人民实现他们统一本国的愿望。
    由于美国和联合国军方面的其他国家的阻挠，朝鲜的和平统一问题，特别是从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的问题，在长时期内没有能够获得解决，这对于参加朝鲜中立国监察委员会的中立国家，自然产生了一定的实际困难。但是，联合国军方面在1956年5月28日给中国政府的答复中，却颠倒是非地指责朝中方面阻挠中立国监察委员会的工作，诬蔑朝中方面自朝鲜境外运入增援性的军事人员和物资。这种指责和诬蔑是没有任何根据的。事实正好相反，朝中方面一贯严格遵守停战协定，给予中立国监察委员会以充分的合作，而违反停战协定以大量增援性的武器装备李承晚集团的军队，并且百般阻挠中立国监察委员会的工作的正是美国政府。举世皆知，在美国政府的纵容下，李承晚集团对中立国监察委员会的人员进行种种侮辱，甚至于使用暴力。很明显，中立国监察委员会监督停战的工作，特别是中立国监察委员会驻在南方港口的视察小组的工作，已经日益成为美国政府和李承晚集团进一步破坏停战协定的障碍。只是因为这个缘故，联合国军方面才自相矛盾地在它的照会中一面声称支持朝鲜停战协定，另一方面却公开表示中立国监察委员会按照停战协定在南朝鲜进行的活动对美国方面是一种“负担”。人们要问，如果美国真正愿意“努力维护停战的有效性”，为什么它又费尽心机想削弱或者限制中立国监察委员会的工作呢？
    事情很清楚，美国政府和联合国军方面其他各国政府拒绝中朝两国政府关于召开有关国家会议的建议，不但阻挠了朝鲜问题的早日解决，使远东局势不能得到进一步和缓，而且还必然增加中立国监察委员会的困难。对此，美国和其他有关各国政府必须承担完全的责任。中国政府对于从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和通过全国自由选举实现朝鲜统一的主张将不因此而有所改变。中国政府将同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府以及世界上爱好和平的国家和人民一道为和平统一朝鲜和和缓国际紧张局势而继续努力。

    中华人民共和国外交部四月九日致联合王国驻华代办处的照会
    中华人民共和国外交部向联合王国驻华代办处致意，并请将下述事项转达联合王国政府。
    一、瑞典政府和瑞士政府曾经多次向中国政府陈述它们在朝鲜中立国监察委员会工作中所遇到的实际困难，希望能够得到解决。中国政府一贯同情瑞典政府和瑞士政府的处境，并且曾经不断努力设法减轻它们的困难。最近，瑞典政府又建议暂时把现在分驻在南北朝鲜的六个特定口岸的中立国视察小组全部撤回，只是在必要时才临时派出视察小组；瑞士政府则建议完全取消现有的六个特定口岸的中立国视察小组，而只保留机动视察小组。中国政府认为，瑞典政府和瑞士政府所一再提出的实际困难，只有在朝鲜的和平统一问题，首先是从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的问题得到解决的情况下，才能得到根本的解决。
    二、自从1954年在日内瓦举行的关于朝鲜问题的会议以来，朝中方面一直主张召开有关国家的会议协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜等问题。中国政府并且相信，只要有关各方都具有谋求解决的真诚愿望，这些问题是可以求得合理解决的。
    三、基于以上的考虑，中国政府以自己的名义，并且受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，向联合王国政府，并且通过联合王国政府，向联合国军方面其它各国政府建议召开有关国家的会议来协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜等问题。朝鲜政府和中国政府请联合王国政府把这项建议转达给联合国军方面其它各国政府。朝鲜政府和中国政府希望联合王国政府和联合国军方面其它各国政府对于此项建议予以积极的考虑，并且尽早答复。此照

                附件二
    联合王国驻华代办处五月二十八日的复照北京、外交部国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来先生阁下阁下：
    我奉女王陛下外交大臣之命，答复阁下1956年4月9日部研字第九号来照，其中提到朝鲜中立国监察委员会的困难，并且建议举行会议讨论从朝鲜撤退外国军队和统一朝鲜的问题。
    联合王国女王陛下政府，依照阁下四月九日照会中的要求，已经把那份照会转致参加联合国军的其他各国政府，它们在进行磋商以后，请女王陛下政府代表它们提出答复。
    长期以来，参加联合国军各国政府认为朝鲜的根本问题，是在于朝鲜人民统一本国的希望受到了挫折。在日内瓦它们详细说明了它们关于符合联合国目标而公正解决这个问题的立场。在最近两届的联合国大会上，又重申了这个立场，联合国绝大多数会员国赞同了这个立场。
    至于中华人民共和国和北朝鲜政权关于举行会议来讨论撤退外国军队和统一问题的建议，参加联合国军的各国政府看不出中华人民共和国和北朝鲜政权的立场有任何改变，足以使这样一个会议得到成果。参加联合国军的各国政府仍然准备随时在联合国目标的基础上讨论统一的问题。如果中华人民共和国和北朝鲜政权有符合联合国目标的解决朝鲜问题的具体建议，参加联合国军的各国政府准备对这种建议给予一切的考虑。
    在中华人民共和国和北朝鲜政权不愿意在联合国目标的基础上进行协商的情况下，中立国监察委员会能够并且应该同统一的问题分开。在统一问题上取得协议以前，停战协定在朝鲜继续有效，而且有关各方都应该努力维护停战的有效性，并且纠正所发生的有关停战的问题。参加联合国军的各国政府愿重申它们支持停战协定并且有意对该地区的和平作出贡献。
    参加联合国军的各国政府不能接受1956年4月9日来照中所说的这句话，即中华人民共和国和北朝鲜政权曾经“不断设法减轻”瑞典和瑞士政府在中立国监察委员会工作中所遇到的困难，因为这些困难事实上是由中国和北朝鲜方面本身的行为所造成的。四月九日来照中所提到的瑞士和瑞典政府的建议所以成为必要（参加联合国军的各国政府认为这些建议是合理的，并且予以全力的支持），是由于中国和北朝鲜方面自从停战协定最初签订以来一直采取了有计划地阻挠中立国监察委员会进行工作的政策。中国和北朝鲜方面一贯通过停战协定所规定的口岸以外的其他口岸把军事人员和物资运入朝鲜，并且没有把这些运入情况报告中立国监察委员会。由于中立国监察委员会中捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员的阻挠，有效地阻止了联合国军对于这些运入的指控得到调查。总之，中国和北朝鲜方面已经完全阻挠了中立国监察委员会在非军事区以北地区的任何有效的监督。在这种情况下，中立国监察委员会中捷克斯洛伐克和波兰成员在非军事区以南的活动对于联合国军方面是一种不公平的负担。联合国军将在军事停战委员会中充分地宣布它在这个问题上的立场。
    鉴于以上所说的，并且考虑到中国和北朝鲜方面在实际行动中所表现出来的关于它对中立国监察委员会所负担的义务所持的态度，参加联合国军的各国政府认为，还没有表现出任何诚意的征象，而只有诚意才能使任何新的会议达到有用的目的。参加联合国军的各国政府认为，在中国和北朝鲜方面准备以诚意在联合国目标的基础上来进行协商以前，再一次会议只能导致1954年在日内瓦造成的僵局的重演。
    顺向阁下重申最崇高的敬意。
