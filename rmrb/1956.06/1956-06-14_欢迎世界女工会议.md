    Welcome the World Congress of Women Workers
    The World Congress of Women Workers is scheduled to open today in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. More than 500 women worker representatives from most countries around the world, including those with different political beliefs and different trade union organizations, will attend the conference. They will discuss issues concerning women workers from various countries striving for economic and social rights and defending peace, exchange experiences in struggle, and establish and expand friendly relations among women workers from various countries. This conference marks the great unity of women workers worldwide and will help strengthen the struggle of women workers from various countries to fight for common interests, and will also have a positive impact on the international workers' movement and the cause of world peace.
    Women workers are an important component of the working class. They make important contributions to the creation of social material wealth. However, women workers face different fates under different social systems. Under the capitalist system, women workers are subjected to extremely cruel oppression and exploitation, and their suffering is even greater than that of male workers. Now, the economic situation in many capitalist countries is becoming increasingly unstable, and the situation of women workers in these countries continues to deteriorate, with less and less guarantee of their right to life and political rights. They urgently demand to strengthen the unity of the working class and change this extremely unreasonable situation. This shows that it is very timely and necessary to convene an international conference to discuss issues of common concern to women workers in various countries.
    The World Congress of Women Workers will discuss the main issues of common concern to women workers in various countries, namely the issue of striving for increased wages and realizing equal pay for equal work. As everyone knows, in capitalist countries and colonial dependencies, women workers are subjected to various forms of discrimination by capitalists, and their wages are very meager. Even if they do the same work as men, their wages are much lower than those of male workers. Although the governments of many countries have signed the International Labor Organization Convention in favor of equal pay for equal work, the principle of equal pay for equal work has never been effectively implemented in practice. This makes the vast number of women workers and their families live a shocking and tragic life, while the capitalists obtain huge extra profits from it. At the same time, due to the existence of cheap labor of women workers, capitalists can try their best to suppress the wage levels of all workers. Therefore, striving to achieve equal pay for equal work not only conforms to the vital interests of women workers, but also helps to improve the living conditions of the entire working class.
    Striving for women workers to participate more actively in trade union work and widely developing women members is another important issue to be discussed at the World Congress of Women Workers. Women workers in capitalist countries have deeply realized in their long-term struggle that only by strengthening unity and fighting together can the interests of women workers be respected and the social status and political rights of women workers be not ignored. Therefore, it is completely understandable that women workers in capitalist countries are increasingly strongly opposed to various restrictions and discriminatory policies against them, and demand the right to freely participate in social activities and trade union activities. At the same time, trade union organizations in various countries recruit more women workers to participate, which will not only strengthen the class consciousness and organization of women workers, enabling them to achieve greater results in the struggle for their own economic and social rights, but will also greatly enhance the fighting power of the entire workers' movement.
    At this conference, representatives from various countries will also study how women workers can better participate in the struggle to ease the international situation. Therefore, it can be expected that the conference will make valuable contributions to the cause of world peace.
    The women worker representatives from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries who are participating in this conference will report on their happy lives and brilliant achievements after gaining freedom and liberation. In these countries, women workers have obtained all political, economic and social rights. They actively participate in various tasks of national construction and give full play to their wisdom and talents. They have not only gained equal status with men, equal pay for equal work, and enjoy labor protection; moreover, their special difficulties and interests are also taken care of and guaranteed by national laws. Women workers in capitalist countries will see their own bright future from here, and will be greatly encouraged in the struggle for women's liberation and social liberation.
    Chinese women workers deeply care about and sympathize with the difficult situation of women workers in capitalist countries and colonial dependencies, and are happy for the achievements of their every heroic struggle. Our women workers will never forget that in the past, in their arduous struggle for liberation together with the people of the whole country, women worker sisters from various countries gave great moral and spiritual support. Today, as our country enters the period of socialist construction, we still need the support and help of women workers from various countries. The Chinese delegation attending the World Congress of Women Workers will express the deep feelings of Chinese women workers to sisters from various countries, report on the achievements made by our women workers in various aspects after liberation, widely contact women worker representatives from various countries, and promote mutual understanding and friendship between Chinese women workers and women workers from various countries.
    Chinese women workers and the Chinese people warmly welcome the opening of the World Congress of Women Workers, and wish the conference brilliant achievements in uniting women workers from various countries in the struggle for peace and common interests.

    欢迎世界女工会议
    世界女工会议定今天在匈牙利首都布达佩斯开幕。参加会议的有世界大部分国家的、包括不同政治信仰和不同工会组织的五百多名女工代表。她们将要在会议上讨论各国女工争取经济、社会权利和保卫和平的问题，交流斗争经验，建立和扩大各国女工的友好联系。这次会议标志着世界女工的大团结，有助于加强各国女工为争取共同利益的斗争，对国际工人运动和世界和平事业也将发生有利的影响。
    女工是工人阶级的重要组成部分。她们对创造社会物质财富有着重要的贡献。但是，女工在不同的社会制度下，遭遇着不同的命运。在资本主义制度之下，女工受到十分残酷的压迫和剥削，她们的痛苦比男工更为深重。现在，许多资本主义国家的经济状况越来越不稳定，这些国家女工的处境还在继续恶化，生活权利和政治权利都更加没有保障，她们迫切地要求加强工人阶级的团结，改变目前这种极端不合理的状况。这就说明，召开一次国际性会议，来讨论各国女工所共同关心的问题，是非常适时和必要的。
    世界女工会议将讨论各国女工共同关心的主要问题，这就是争取增加工资和实现同工同酬的问题。大家知道，在资本主义国家和殖民地附属国内，女工受到资本家的各种歧视，工资十分微薄。她们即使担任和男子同样的工作，但是所得到的工资却比男工低得多。许多国家的政府虽然曾经在赞成同工同酬的国际劳工组织公约上签了字，但是同工同酬的原则在实际上始终没有有效地实行过。这就使得广大女工和她们的家庭过着骇人听闻的悲惨生活，而资本家却由此获得巨大的额外利润。同时，由于女工的廉价劳动力的存在，资本家便可以尽量地压低所有工人的工资水平。因此，争取实现同工同酬，这不仅符合女工的切身利益，也有利于整个工人阶级生活条件的改善。
    争取女工更积极地参加工会工作和广泛发展女工会员，是世界女工会议要讨论的另一个重要问题。资本主义国家的女工在长期的斗争中深刻地体会到，只有加强团结，共同斗争，才能使女工的利益得到尊重，女工的社会地位和政治权利不被忽视。因此，资本主义国家的女工愈来愈强烈地反对对她们的各种限制和歧视政策，要求享有自由地参加社会活动和工会活动的权利，是完全可以理解的。同时，各国工会组织吸收更多的女工参加，不仅将加强女工的阶级觉悟和组织性，使她们在争取本身经济和社会权利的斗争中获得更大的成果，而且将大大地增强整个工人运动的战斗力量。
    在这次会议上，各国代表还将研究女工如何更好地参加争取缓和国际局势的斗争的问题，因此，人们可以期望，会议对世界和平事业将作出可贵的贡献。
    参加这次会议的苏联和各人民民主国家的女工代表，将要在会议上报告她们在获得自由和解放后的幸福生活和辉煌成就。在这些国家里，女工已经得到一切政治、经济和社会权利，她们积极地参加了国家建设的各项工作，充分地发挥了自己的智慧和才能。她们不仅已经获得了和男子平等的地位，同工同酬，享受劳动保护；并且，她们的特殊困难和利益，同样受到国家法律的照顾和保障。资本主义国家的女工将要从这里看到她们自己的美好的未来，从而在为争取妇女解放和社会解放的斗争中得到巨大的鼓舞。
    中国女工深切地关怀和同情资本主义国家和殖民地附属国女工的困难处境，并为她们每一次的英勇斗争的成就而感到喜悦。我国女工将永远不会忘记，过去在她们同全国人民一道争取解放的艰巨斗争中，各国女工姊妹们曾经给了道义上和精神上的巨大支持。今天在我国进入社会主义建设的时期，我们仍然需要各国女工的支持和帮助。这次出席世界女工会议的中国代表团，将向各国女工表达中国女工对各国姊妹们的深厚感情，报告我国女工解放后在各方面获得的成就，广泛地同各国女工代表接触，促进我国女工同各国女工之间的相互了解和友谊。
    中国女工和中国人民热烈地欢迎世界女工会议开幕，并祝会议在团结各国女工争取和平和共同利益的斗争中获得光辉的成就。
