    West German Industrial and Commercial Circles Demand Trade with Socialist Camp Countries
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A recent issue of the British "Foreign Report," published in mid-May, said in an article that the Soviet Union's recent proposal to Britain to expand trade has aroused "envy" in West Germany. As in Britain, small and medium-sized companies in West Germany are "very interested" in the proposal to conclude a trade agreement with the Soviet Union. "Large and continuous Russian orders can keep factories busy for several years, which is naturally attractive to smaller factories."
    The article pointed out that the strong demands of West German industrial and commercial circles for trade with socialist camp countries are manifested in the following four aspects: (1) open or implicit criticism of the Western embargo policy; (2) the Federation of West German Industries has put forward a new proposal to send a delegation to China; (3) demands to sign a trade agreement with the Soviet Union, but the West German government has not yet accepted this proposal; (4) demands for more trade with East Germany.
    The article concludes: West German business people are dissatisfied with the West German government's obstruction of trade with East Germany.

    西德工商界要求同社会主义阵营国家贸易
    据新华社讯　五月中旬出版的一期英国“外事报道”在一篇文章中说，苏联最近向英国提出的扩大贸易的建议，在西德引起了“羡慕”。和在英国一样，西德的中等的大小公司对同苏联缔结贸易协定的主张“感到很大兴趣”。“大笔的和不断的俄国定货单可以使得工厂忙上几年，这对于比较小的工厂自然有吸引力”。
    文章指出，西德工商界要求同社会主义阵营国家贸易的强烈要求表现在下列四个方面：（一）公开的或含蓄的批评西方禁运政策；（二）西德工业家联合会提出了派遣一个代表团到中国去的新建议；（三）要求同苏联签订贸易协定，但是西德政府还没有接受这个主张；（四）要求和民主德国作更多的贸易。
    文章最后写道：西德工商界人士对于西德政府阻挠同民主德国贸易感到不满。
