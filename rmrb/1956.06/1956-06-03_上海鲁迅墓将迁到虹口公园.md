    Lu Xun's Tomb in Shanghai to be Moved to Hongkou Park

    This year marks the 75th anniversary of Lu Xun's birth and the 20th anniversary of his death. To commemorate this great writer, thinker, and revolutionary, the Ministry of Culture has decided to move Lu Xun's tomb from the Shanghai International Cemetery to Hongkou Park in Shanghai this year. This park is very close to Lu Xun's former residence on Shanyin Road (Continental New Village) and was a place where Lu Xun often took walks during his lifetime. It has now been officially started for reconstruction according to the new plan.

    In accordance with Mr. Lu Xun's lifelong heroic and resolute character and his love for the people and humble and simple style, the newly built Lu Xun Mausoleum will be a simple yet solemn tomb shape. In front of the tomb is a platform that can accommodate two to three hundred people, and there are flower stands on both sides, with seats provided below the flower stands. Evergreen flowers and plants will also be planted on both sides of the tomb. According to the designer's plan, the tomb will be built in the center of Hongkou Park, making it both solemn and intimate, allowing people to contemplate in silence.

    The Lu Xun Memorial Exhibition Hall will be built at the same time as Lu Xun's Tomb, and it will be located on the right side of Hongkou Park. The hall will display Mr. Lu Xun's manuscripts and related cultural relics. (Our Shanghai Correspondent)

    上海鲁迅墓将迁到虹口公园
    今年是鲁迅先生诞生七十五周年和逝世二十周年，为了纪念这位伟大的文学家、思想家和革命家，中央文化部已经决定在今年将鲁迅墓由上海万国公墓迁移到上海虹口公园。这个公园距鲁迅故居山阴路大陆新村很近，原是鲁迅生前经常散步的地方，目前已根据新的规划正式开工改建。
    根据鲁迅先生一生英勇刚毅的性格，热爱人民谦逊朴实的作风，新建的鲁迅陵墓将是一座既简洁又庄严的墓形。墓的前面有一个可以容纳二、三百人的平台，两边还有花架，花架下面设有坐椅。墓的两旁还种植终年常青的花草。按照设计师的规划，墓将建在虹口公园的中心，让它既庄严又亲切，使人能幽思默念。
    和鲁迅墓同时兴建的还有鲁迅纪念陈列馆，它将设在虹口公园中的右首。馆内将陈列鲁迅先生的遗墨和有关文物。　（本报驻上海记者）
