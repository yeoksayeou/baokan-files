Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 10th. Since the second quarter of this year, three thousand tons of bird guano mined from the Xisha Islands have been transported to Hainan Island and the Guangdong mainland.

On Yongxing Island in the Xisha Islands, because of the abundance of seabirds, the accumulated bird guano is especially plentiful. Bird guano layers cover more than half of the island's area, with an average thickness of about 22 centimeters.

According to surveys, the accumulated amount of bird guano in the Xisha Islands is 680,000 tons. The composition of the bird guano there contains large amounts of phosphorus, organic matter, and small amounts of nitrogen and potassium. The state-owned South China Aquatic Products Company and fishermen from Hainan Island transported a lot of bird guano from there last year, and tests have proven its fertilizer effect to be good. In addition, bird guano can also be used as a raw material for manufacturing caffeine.

    西沙群岛开采的鸟粪运回大陆
    新华社广州10日电　在西沙群岛开采的鸟粪，今年第二季度以来已经有三千吨运到海南岛和广东大陆。
    西沙群岛中的永兴岛上，因为海鸟繁多，因而蓄积的鸟粪也特别多。全岛面积有大半都堆积有鸟粪层，厚度平均约二十二公分。
    据勘测，西沙群岛的鸟粪积蓄量有六十八万吨。那里的鸟粪的成分含有大量的磷、有机质及少量的氮和钾。国营南海水产公司和海南岛渔民，去年从那里采运了许多鸟粪，试验以后证明肥效良好。另外，鸟粪还可以作为制造咖啡因的原料。
