Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 10th. On the main transportation routes leading to the construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex and on the roads within the construction area, hundreds of trucks are speeding, raising clouds of yellow dust. Drivers transport nearly 10,000 tons of building materials to various construction sites every day. As the start date of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex approaches, the transportation network needed for construction is becoming dense on the construction site. A dedicated railway line connecting the main railway line and several branch lines have been extended to the construction site and the water transportation terminal. In the near future, construction-specific locomotives and freight cars will also enter the construction site.

Since November of last year, twelve auxiliary enterprise projects serving the prefabricated construction of the iron and steel complex have started construction one after another. Now, concrete mixing plants, combined wood processing plants, and steel processing plants have been put into production and have begun to send concrete and various steel bars, concrete, and prefabricated wooden building components to the construction site. Construction machinery repair plants, reinforced concrete prefabricated parts plants, pipeline processing plants, and electrical decoration and distribution plants are either installing machinery and equipment or partially put into production. Considering the huge scale of construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex in the future, this batch of auxiliary enterprises cannot fully meet the construction needs. The builders are accelerating the construction speed of the auxiliary enterprises and are starting to expand their production capacity.

A year ago, this area of ​​dozens of square kilometers was still a hilly, open field, with surveyors' red flags and markers everywhere. Within a few months, the builders leveled hills and filled in fields and ponds, and built the first batch of workers' new villages on the construction site. Steel enterprise builders gathered here from Northeast China, Taiyuan, Chongqing, and other places have settled down. The construction site is bustling, forming a new town. Not long ago, another batch of workers' new villages capable of housing 20,000 people began to be built.

At night, in the workers' village of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex construction site, electric lights shine like a field of stars. Loudspeakers broadcast music. At this time, the workers who have finished their work during the day go to the spare time schools in groups of three or five to attend cultural classes; in the distance, the roar of machinery can still be heard from the construction site, and the night shift drivers are operating excavators, scrapers, and bulldozers, advancing to the hills and fields overnight to level the site foundation for the future factory buildings of the iron and steel complex.

Title: DPRK Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Condemning Unilateral US Actions Undermining Korean Armistice Agreement

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 10th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement regarding the temporary withdrawal by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) of its inspection teams from specific ports in North and South Korea.

The statement said: The United Nations Command unilaterally announced on May 31 that it would cease implementing the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the authority of the NNSC and its inspection teams within the military control area of the United Nations Command, and would withdraw the NNSC inspection teams from existing specific ports in South Korea within a week. This unilateral measure by the United States is a blatant act of sabotage against the Armistice Agreement. As is well known, American government officials and the Syngman Rhee clique have consistently advocated for the abolition of the Armistice Agreement, creating various provocative acts of violence and slanderous disturbances against members of the NNSC, and systematically undermining the work of the commission. The Korean-Chinese side and the NNSC have repeatedly demanded that the United States immediately cease these rude behaviors that cause practical difficulties in the NNSC's performance of its duties. However, the United States has systematically aggravated the situation, further deepening the practical difficulties of the NNSC. The purpose of the United States continuing its attempt to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement is to greatly expand the South Korean army, and transport large quantities of modern weapons, including atomic weapons, into South Korea to equip it, in order to launch a new bloody war in Korea.

The statement emphasized: The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will never tolerate this blatant act of sabotage against the Armistice Agreement. In order to prevent the status and authority of the NNSC from being harmed by the unilateral actions of the United States, and to prevent the Armistice Agreement from being undermined, the Korean-Chinese side suggested agreeing to the Swedish government's proposal of March 10, 1956, to temporarily withdraw inspection teams from specific ports in North and South Korea, and to temporarily dispatch inspection teams when necessary, as a temporary arrangement.

The statement said, however, that the United States rejected this legitimate proposal from the Korean-Chinese side, which was conducive to maintaining the Korean Armistice Agreement. This attitude of the United States is completely inconsistent with the statement made by the governments of the countries concerned of the United Nations Command in their reply to the Chinese government on May 28, 1956, that they supported the Korean Armistice Agreement, and that they supported the recommendations of Sweden and Switzerland regarding the NNSC.

The statement, after referring to the proposals made by the NNSC and the Korean-Chinese side on June 5th and 7th respectively, that the authority of the NNSC should not be changed, pointed out that these claims to uphold the Korean Armistice Agreement and the status and authority of the NNSC and its inspection teams, have once again been rejected by the United States, which is attempting to undermine the legitimate activities of the NNSC.

The statement said: The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea declares the following regarding the situation created:

As stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean Armistice Agreement must never be undermined by the unilateral decisions of the United States. The statutory authority of the NNSC must also never be changed by the unilateral actions of the United States.

As proposed by the NNSC, the withdrawal of NNSC inspection teams from specific ports in the North and South is only a temporary measure.

The NNSC has full authority to redeploy inspection teams to specific ports.

The United States, a party to the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the other countries of the United Nations Command, have a full responsibility to strictly abide by the Armistice Agreement and respect the statutory status and authority of the NNSC as stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

If this is not the case, they will not be able to escape full responsibility for undermining the Armistice Agreement and all the consequences arising therefrom.

    武汉钢铁联合企业施工前的景象
    新华社武汉10日电　通向武汉钢铁联合企业工地的运输干道和建筑场区内的公路线上，几百辆载重汽车奔驰着，扬起阵阵黄尘。驾驶员们每天把近万吨的建筑材料运往各个施工现场。随着武汉钢铁联合企业开工期限日渐临近，施工需要的交通运输网正在工地上密布起来。连接铁路干线的一条专用铁路和几条支线，已经伸延到工地和水运码头。不久的将来，施工专用的火车机车和货运车厢，也将驶进工地。
    从去年十一月以来，先后开工的十二项为钢铁联合企业工厂化施工服务的附属企业工程，现在已经有混凝土搅拌厂、木材联合加工厂和钢筋加工厂投入生产，开始把混凝土和各种钢筋、混凝土、木材预制建筑构件，送往施工场地。施工机械修理厂、钢筋混凝土预制品厂、管道加工厂、电装修配厂等，有的正在安装机器设备，有的部分投入了生产。考虑到武汉钢铁联合企业将来施工规模巨大，这一批附属企业还不能完全满足施工需要，建筑者们正加快附属企业的建设速度，并且着手扩大它们的生产能力。
    一年以前，在这块方圆数十里的地区，还是一片丘陵、旷野，到处插着测量人员的红旗和标杆。建设者们在几个月内铲削山丘，填实田塘，在工地上建起了第一批工人新村。从东北、太原、重庆等地汇集在这里的钢铁企业建设者们，已经定居下来。工地上熙熙攘攘，形成了一个新的城镇。不久前，另一批能居住两万来人的工人新村开始兴建。
    夜晚，武汉钢铁联合企业工地的工人村里，电灯像一片繁星。扩音器播送着音乐。这时，白天做完工的工人们，三五成群地走进业余学校去上文化课；远处工地上还不时传出机械的轰鸣，夜班驾驶手们正在操纵着挖土机、铲运机、推土机，连夜向丘陵田野进军，为钢铁联合企业未来的厂房工程平整厂基。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发表声明谴责美方破坏朝鲜停战协定的片面行动
    新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省今天发表关于朝鲜中立国监察委员会暂时撤回它在朝鲜南部和北部特定口岸的视察小组的声明。
    声明说：联合国军方面在五月三十一日片面宣布：在联合国军军事控制区域内停止实行停战协定关于中立国监察委员会和它的视察小组的职权的条款，并且在一星期内从南朝鲜现存特定口岸撤出中立国视察小组。美方的这种片面措施是对停战协定的公然的破坏行动。如所周知，美国政府的官方人士和李承晚集团一向不断地主张废除停战协定，制造对中立国监察委员会成员的各种挑衅性暴行和诬蔑性骚动，有系统地破坏这个委员会的工作。朝中方面和中立国监察委员会屡次要求美方立即中止对中立国监察委员会执行任务方面造成实际困难的这种粗暴的行为。但是，美方却有计划地使情况严重化，进一步加深了中立国监察委员会的实际困难。美方如此继续企图破坏朝鲜停战协定的目的在于大大扩充南朝鲜军队，把包括原子武器在内的现代化武器大量运入南朝鲜境内，装备它，以便在朝鲜重新发动新的流血战争。
    声明强调说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府绝不能容忍这种对停战协定的粗暴的破坏行为。朝中方面为了防止中立国监察委员会的地位和职权由于美方的片面行为而遭到损害，停战协定遭到破坏，便建议同意瑞典政府1956年3月10日的关于从朝鲜南部和北部的特定口岸暂时撤出视察小组，而在有必要时临时派遣视察小组这一建议，作为临时性的安排。
    声明说，但是，美方拒绝了朝中方面的这一有利于维护朝鲜停战协定的正当建议。美方的这种态度，是和联合国军方面有关各国政府在1956年5月28日给中国政府的答复中表示支持朝鲜停战协定，又是和支持瑞典、瑞士对中立国监察委员会的建议的这一说法完全不相符合的。
    声明谈到中立国监察委员会和朝中方面分别在六月五日和七日提出了不改变中立国监察委员会的职权的建议以后指出，这些维护朝鲜停战协定和中立国监察委员会和它的视察小组的地位和职权的主张，又一次被企图破坏中立国监察委员会的合法活动的美方拒绝了。
    声明说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府就所造成了的形势，声明如下：
    如同朝鲜停战协定所规定的一样，绝不容许朝鲜停战协定由于美方的片面决定而遭到破坏。中立国监察委员会的法定职权也绝不因美方的片面行为而有所改变。
    如同中立国监察委员会所提出的一样，中立国视察小组撤离南北的特定口岸，只不过是临时的措施。
    中立国监察委员会完全有权把视察小组重新派遣到特定口岸。
    朝鲜停战协定的一方——美国和联合国军其他各国完全有责任严格遵守停战协定，尊重停战协定所规定的中立国监察委员会的法定地位和职权。
    如果不是这样，它们将不能逃避对破坏停战协定和由此而发生的一切后果的全部责任。
