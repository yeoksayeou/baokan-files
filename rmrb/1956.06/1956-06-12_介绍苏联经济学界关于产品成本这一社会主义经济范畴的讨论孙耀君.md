Introducing the Discussion on Product Cost as a Socialist Economic Category in Soviet Economics Circles
    Sun Yaojun

From some Soviet economic books and periodicals, it can be seen that there are different opinions among Soviet economists regarding product cost as a socialist economic category and the economic essence of product cost under the socialist system. However, a more focused discussion on this issue began after the publication of Le Contaire's "On the Economic Essence of Cost in Socialist Industry" in the tenth issue of the Soviet "Economic Issues" magazine in 1954. This article criticized the opinions of some Soviet economists on this issue and put forward its own views. Subsequently, the editorial department of "Economic Issues" magazine received a number of articles and launched a discussion on this issue. Now we will briefly introduce some of the issues touched upon in this discussion.

First, what is the economic essence of product cost? What is the relationship between product cost and the socially necessary consumption of producing products?

Regarding this question, the first opinion is that the cost of a product, in its economic essence, is determined by the socially necessary consumption of producing the product. Product cost is that part of the socially necessary consumption used to compensate for the material resources consumed in producing the product (machine wear and tear, depreciation of factory buildings, consumption of raw materials, etc.) and the payment of wages. As for why product cost indicators can represent the quality of enterprise work and promote the improvement of enterprise work, they believe that this is mainly due to the comparison between planned cost and actual cost. For example, Vo. Redenek, who participated in the discussion, said: "A definition can be given to cost: cost is that part of the production cost that should be constantly returned to the enterprise in order to ensure the uninterruptedness of production, repeatedly used to obtain the material elements of production and pay wages, etc." (Soviet "Economic Issues" magazine, first issue of 1956.)

Another opinion is that the cost of industrial products is not determined by the socially necessary consumption of producing products, but by the total number of various actual consumption that varies according to the specific conditions of each enterprise. Those who advocate this view believe that the first opinion above ignores the fact that cost is an indicator of the quality of enterprise work, and that only calculating costs based on the actual consumption of enterprises can promote enterprises to improve their work. For example, Le Contaire said: "The cost of the same product produced by different enterprises is also different. At this time, the cost reflects the expenses incurred by the economically accountable enterprise in the production and sales of products. From this point of view, it would be a big mistake to plan the product production costs of enterprises based on socially necessary consumption. If costs are determined by socially necessary consumption, then the cost plan should be based on the same or average raw material consumption quotas, equipment utilization quotas, and the same labor productivity for each enterprise in the department. In this way, the planned costs of the same products produced by different enterprises will be exactly the same. However, this will only make the product cost plans of various enterprises lose their mobilizing role in improving the economic activities of the enterprise. ... The cost of industrial products should be understood as the total number of various consumptions of industrial enterprises in production and sales." (Ibid., tenth issue of 1954)

Second, what does product cost include? Does product cost include non-productive consumption?

On this issue, the first opinion is that product cost only includes productive consumption, and does not include non-productive consumption. Because they believe that product cost is a part of socially necessary consumption, and non-productive consumption is not socially necessary consumption, it is not included in the cost. For example, Vo. Gadirobel and Vo. Ganstack, who participated in the discussion, believed that product cost "cannot include non-productive expenses and losses." (Ibid., first issue of 1956)

Another opinion, however, believes that the above view ignores the fact that cost is first and foremost an important indicator of the quality of enterprise work. For example, Le Contaire believes that the non-productive consumption incurred by enterprises in the production of products precisely reflects the quality of the work of the enterprise, so it should be included in the cost of the product. Another example is Ge. Shavuka, who believes: "If, as some authors suggest, a series of expenses, losses, and non-productive expenses determined by the quality of enterprise work are removed from the composition of costs, the product costs will be falsely reduced, and the work of the enterprise will appear to be smooth. Such a 'cost' is not a weapon to improve the quality of work of the factory collective, but on the contrary, it is a means to obscure various shortcomings in the work of the enterprise. The cost of industrial products should include all expenses for the production and sales of such products, regardless of their nature." (Ibid., first issue of 1956)

Third, is there a departmental average product cost? From what perspective should the issue of product cost be examined?

This question is also closely related to the issue of the essence of product cost. The first opinion is that since product cost, in its economic essence, is socially necessary consumption, it should not be examined from the perspective of a single enterprise, but from the perspective of social production. Therefore, the departmental average cost objectively exists. For example, Ke. Dimitrov believes that "since cost is an economic category, then, obviously, we are concerned not with the cost of a certain enterprise, but with social cost." (Ibid., first issue of 1956) A. Omarov and Ge. Grigoryan believe that "the departmental average cost is the expression of social consumption in the corresponding industrial sector." (Ibid., first issue of 1956)

Le Contaire holds a different view. He believes that since product cost is the total number of various actual consumption in the production of products in an enterprise, the cost issue should be examined from the perspective of the enterprise. Therefore, the departmental average cost does not actually exist, but is merely a statistical concept. He pointed out: "The cost of a product is based on the specific working conditions of each enterprise, and the costs of various regions of the country cannot be unified, because the production costs of the same product produced by different enterprises will not be the same. Therefore, one of the important tasks of compiling a cost plan is to correctly estimate the characteristics of the work of each enterprise. The so-called departmental average cost is merely the average cost of each enterprise in a certain production department, and therefore it is only a statistical concept." (Ibid., tenth issue of 1954)

Fourth, how is the cost of a product determined? What role does the socialist state play in the determination of costs?

One opinion is that the cost of a product is objectively determined by the consumption in the production of the product, and the objective basis of the product cost of each enterprise is the individual value of the product. Those who advocate this view criticize those who overemphasize the regulatory role of the socialist state on the cost level and cost composition as having a subjective tendency. For example, Vo. Gadirobel and Vo. Ganstack said: "The objective basis for the different costs of the same product in different enterprises is ultimately the individual value and individual production consumption." (Ibid., first issue of 1956) Ke. Dimitrov criticized those who overemphasize the state's regulatory role on costs as "analyzing costs in accordance with subjectivism." (Ibid., first issue of 1956) Ye. Ivanov also criticized the view that the socialist state can arbitrarily include or exclude certain expenses in the cost.

Le Contaire relatively emphasized the regulatory role of the socialist state on the cost level and cost composition. He believes: "The socialist state plans and regulates the level and composition of costs according to the socialist economic laws and the specific tasks of the national economy. From the perspective of the interests of the state, it can include certain expenses of the state in the cost of industrial products. Conversely, it can also include certain expenses of industry in the state budget... Therefore, the product cost of industry is directly affected by the regulatory role of the socialist state." (Ibid., tenth issue of 1954)

Fifth, what is the relationship between product cost and product value? In addition to the quantitative difference between them, is there a qualitative difference?

One opinion is that product cost is a part of the socially necessary consumption of the product, that is, the value of the product. Therefore, product cost and product value are basically homogeneous, with only quantitative differences. For example, Le. Yakhnin believes that the difference between product cost and product value lies in "the former is only a part of the production consumption paid by the economically accountable enterprise in the production of products in monetary form, and the latter includes all labor consumption, a part of which becomes accumulation and profit." (Le. Yakhnin: "Principles of Technical and Economic Analysis of Socialist Industrial Costs," National Light Industry Publishing House, 1953 Russian edition.) Vo. Ganstack stipulated the following formula for the relationship between product value and product cost in a pamphlet written earlier: "The value of a commodity is equal to the cost plus the value of the surplus product." (Vo. Ganstack: "Product Cost and Its Ways to Reduce It," Sverdlov Publishing House, 1948 Russian edition)

Another opinion is that product cost and product value are not only different in quantity, but also different in quality. Because value is determined by socially necessary consumption, while cost is the actual consumption of each enterprise, they are two different categories. Product cost includes those non-productive consumption that do not form product value, while on the other hand, some expenses that belong to socially necessary consumption (such as the organization costs of new production, the exploration costs of raw materials and fuel, etc.) are not included in the product cost. For example, Le Contaire said: "It is wrong to think that product cost is a part of value, that it is essentially the same as value, and therefore can only depend on socially necessary consumption. Value and cost are different not only in quantity, but also in quality."

    介绍苏联经济学界关于产品成本这一社会主义经济范畴的讨论
    孙耀君
    从苏联出版的一些经济书刊中可以看出，关于产品成本这一社会主义经济范畴，关于社会主义制度下产品成本的经济本质等问题，在苏联经济学家中是有不同的意见的。但关于这个问题的比较集中的讨论，是从苏联“经济问题”杂志1954年第十期发表了勒·康特尔的“关于社会主义工业中成本的经济本质问题”一文以后开始的。该文批评了苏联某些经济学家在这个问题上的意见，并提出了自己的看法。之后，“经济问题”杂志编辑部陆续收到了一些文章，就此问题展开了讨论。现在我们简单地介绍一下这个讨论中所接触到的一些问题。
    第一，产品成本的经济本质是什么？产品成本同生产产品的社会必要消耗量的关系是怎样的？
    关于这个问题，第一种意见认为产品的成本，按其经济本质来讲，是由生产产品的社会必要消耗量决定的。产品成本就是用补偿生产产品时所耗费的物质资料（机器的磨损、厂房的折旧、原材料的消耗等）和支付工资的那部分社会必要消耗。至于产品成本指标为什么可以表示企业工作的质量、促进企业工作的改进，他们认为这主要是由于把计划成本和实际成本加以比较的结果。例如参加讨论的伏·雷德涅克说：“可以给成本下一个定义：成本是应该经常还归企业以便保证生产的不间断性、重复用来获得生产的物质要素和支付工资等的那部分生产耗费。”（苏联“经济问题”杂志，1956年第一期。）
    另一种意见认为工业品的成本不是由生产产品的社会必要消耗量决定的，而是随各企业的具体条件而不同的各种实际消耗的总数。主张这种意见的人认为上述第一种意见忽略了成本是表示企业工作质量的指标这一点，认为只有按企业的实际消耗来计算成本才能促使企业改进工作。如勒·康特尔说：“由不同企业生产的同一种产品的成本也是不同的，这时，成本反映着经济核算制企业在生产和销售产品上所开销的费用。由此看来，假如根据社会必要耗费来计划企业的产品生产费，那就大错特错了。如果成本决定于社会必要耗费，那么编制成本计划时就应该以本部门各个企业相同的即平均的原材料消耗定额、设备利用定额和相同的劳动生产率为根据。这样一来，不同企业生产的相同产品的计划成本就会完全相同。然而这只能使各企业的产品成本计划失去它对改进企业经济活动的动员作用。……工业品的成本应了解为工业企业用在生产和销售方面的以货币表现的各种消耗的总数。”（同上，1954年第十期）
    第二，产品成本包括些什么？产品成本是否包括非生产性的耗费？
    在这个问题上，第一种意见认为产品成本只包括生产性的耗费，不包括非生产性的耗费。因为他们认为产品成本是社会必要耗费的一部分，而非生产性的耗费并不是社会必要耗费，所以不包括在成本之内。如参加讨论的伏·加第罗贝尔和伏·干斯塔克认为产品成本中“不能包括非生产性的开支和损耗”。（同上，1956年第一期）
    另一种意见却认为上述看法忽略了成本首先是表示企业工作质量的重要指标这一事实。如勒·康特尔认为企业生产产品时所发生的非生产性耗费正是表现企业工作的质量的，所以应该包括在产品成本之中。又如格·沙符卡认为：“假如照某些作者建议的那样从成本的构成中除去一系列的决定于企业工作质量的费用、损失和非生产性的开支，那就会使产品成本得到虚假的降低，使企业工作得到顺利的外貌。这样的‘成本’不是改进工厂集体的工作质量的武器，而相反的是模糊企业工作中各种各样缺点的手段。在工业品成本中应该包括生产和销售这种产品的所有费用，不管它们的性质怎样。”（同上，1956年第一期）
    第三，是不是存在着部门的平均产品成本？应该从什么角度来考察产品成本问题？
    这个问题也是同产品成本本质的问题紧密相关的。第一种意见认为产品成本既然按其经济本质来讲是社会必要耗费，就不能单只从一个企业的角度来考察，而应该从社会生产的角度来考察，所以部门平均成本是客观地存在的。如克·季米特洛夫认为“既然成本是经济范畴，那么，显然我们关心的不是某一个企业的成本而是社会成本”。（同上，1956年第一期）阿·奥马洛夫和格·格里哥里扬认为“部门平均成本是相应工业部门中社会耗费的表现”。（同上，1956年第一期）
    勒·康特尔却持有另一种观点，他认为产品成本既然是企业中生产产品时各种实际消耗的总数，就应该从企业的角度来考察成本问题。所以部门平均成本实际上是不存在的，只不过是统计上的概念。他指出：“产品成本是以各企业的具体工作条件为基础的，全国各地区的成本不能统一，因为在不同企业生产的同种产品，其生产费不会相同。因此，编制成本计划的重要任务之一在于正确地估计各企业的工作特点。所谓部门平均成本仅仅是某生产部门各企业的平均费用，因而它只是统计上的概念。”（同上，1954年第十期）
    第四，产品的成本是怎样确定的？在成本的确定中社会主义国家起着怎样的作用？
    一种意见认为产品的成本是由生产产品时的消耗所客观地确定的，各个企业产品成本的客观基础就是产品的个别价值。主张这种意见的人批评那些过分强调社会主义国家对成本水平和成本构成的调节作用的人有主观主义的倾向。如伏·加第罗贝尔和伏·干斯塔克说：“同一种产品在不同企业的不同成本的客观基础归根到底是个别价值、个别生产耗费”。（同上，1956年第一期）克·季米特洛夫批评那些过分强调国家对成本的调节作用的人是“按着主观主义在分析成本”。（同上，1956年第一期）叶·伊凡诺夫也批评了那种认为社会主义国家可以随便把某种费用列入或不列入成本的观点。
    勒·康特尔则比较强调社会主义国家对成本水平和成本构成的调节作用。他认为：“社会主义国家根据社会主义经济规律和国民经济的具体任务来计划并调节成本的水平和成本的构成，它从国家的利益着眼可以把国家的某些开支列入工业品的成本中，相反的，也可以把工业的某些开支列入国家预算中，……因此，工业的产品成本是受社会主义国家调节作用的直接影响的。”（同上，1954年第十期）
    第五，产品成本和产品价值之间的相互关系是怎样的？它们之间除了量的差别外，有没有质的差别？
    一种意见认为产品成本是产品的社会必要消耗即产品价值的一部分，因此产品成本和产品价值基本上是同质的，只有量的差别。如勒·雅赫宁认为产品成本和产品价值之间的区别在于“前者仅仅是以货币形式表现的经济核算制企业生产产品时付出的生产消耗的一部分，后者包括所有的劳动消耗，其中一部分成为积累和利润”。（勒·雅赫宁：“社会主义工业成本技术经济分析的原则”，国家轻工业出版社1953年俄文版。）伏·干斯塔克在较早时期写的一本小册子中给产品价值和产品成本的关系规定了这样一个公式：“商品的价值等于成本加剩余产品的价值”。（伏·干斯塔克：“产品成本及其降低的途径”斯维尔德洛夫出版社1948年俄文版）
    另一种意见认为产品成本和产品价值不仅在量上有差别，在质上也是不同的。因为价值是由社会必要消耗量决定的，而成本则是各企业的实际消耗量，它们是两个不同的范畴。产品成本中包括那些并不形成产品价值的非生产性耗费，而另一方面有些属于社会必要消耗的费用（如新生产的组织费、原料和燃料的勘探费等）却不包括在产品成本之中。如勒·康特尔说：“认为产品成本是价值的一部分，它和价值在原则上没什么两样，因而只能取决于社会必要消耗的说法是错误的。价值和成本不仅在量上，就是在质上也是不同的。”
