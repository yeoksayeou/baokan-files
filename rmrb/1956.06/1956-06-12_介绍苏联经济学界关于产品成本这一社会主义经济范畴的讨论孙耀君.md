Introducing the Discussion on Product Cost as a Socialist Economic Category in Soviet Economics Circles
    Sun Yaojun

From some Soviet economic books and periodicals, it can be seen that there are different opinions among Soviet economists regarding product cost as a socialist economic category and the economic essence of product cost under the socialist system. However, a more focused discussion on this issue began after the publication of Le Contaire's "On the Economic Essence of Cost in Socialist Industry" in the tenth issue of the Soviet "Economic Issues" magazine in 1954. This article criticized the opinions of some Soviet economists on this issue and put forward its own views. Subsequently, the editorial department of "Economic Issues" magazine received a number of articles and launched a discussion on this issue. Now we will briefly introduce some of the issues touched upon in this discussion.

First, what is the economic essence of product cost? What is the relationship between product cost and the socially necessary consumption of producing products?

Regarding this question, the first opinion is that the cost of a product, in its economic essence, is determined by the socially necessary consumption of producing the product. Product cost is that part of the socially necessary consumption used to compensate for the material resources consumed in producing the product (machine wear and tear, depreciation of factory buildings, consumption of raw materials, etc.) and the payment of wages. As for why product cost indicators can represent the quality of enterprise work and promote the improvement of enterprise work, they believe that this is mainly due to the comparison between planned cost and actual cost. For example, Vo. Redenek, who participated in the discussion, said: "A definition can be given to cost: cost is that part of the production cost that should be constantly returned to the enterprise in order to ensure the uninterruptedness of production, repeatedly used to obtain the material elements of production and pay wages, etc." (Soviet "Economic Issues" magazine, first issue of 1956.)

Another opinion is that the cost of industrial products is not determined by the socially necessary consumption of producing products, but by the total number of various actual consumption that varies according to the specific conditions of each enterprise. Those who advocate this view believe that the first opinion above ignores the fact that cost is an indicator of the quality of enterprise work, and that only calculating costs based on the actual consumption of enterprises can promote enterprises to improve their work. For example, Le Contaire said: "The cost of the same product produced by different enterprises is also different. At this time, the cost reflects the expenses incurred by the economically accountable enterprise in the production and sales of products. From this point of view, it would be a big mistake to plan the product production costs of enterprises based on socially necessary consumption. If costs are determined by socially necessary consumption, then the cost plan should be based on the same or average raw material consumption quotas, equipment utilization quotas, and the same labor productivity for each enterprise in the department. In this way, the planned costs of the same products produced by different enterprises will be exactly the same. However, this will only make the product cost plans of various enterprises lose their mobilizing role in improving the economic activities of the enterprise. ... The cost of industrial products should be understood as the total number of various consumptions of industrial enterprises in production and sales." (Ibid., tenth issue of 1954)

Second, what does product cost include? Does product cost include non-productive consumption?

On this issue, the first opinion is that product cost only includes productive consumption, and does not include non-productive consumption. Because they believe that product cost is a part of socially necessary consumption, and non-productive consumption is not socially necessary consumption, it is not included in the cost. For example, Vo. Gadirobel and Vo. Ganstack, who participated in the discussion, believed that product cost "cannot include non-productive expenses and losses." (Ibid., first issue of 1956)

Another opinion, however, believes that the above view ignores the fact that cost is first and foremost an important indicator of the quality of enterprise work. For example, Le Contaire believes that the non-productive consumption incurred by enterprises in the production of products precisely reflects the quality of the work of the enterprise, so it should be included in the cost of the product. Another example is Ge. Shavuka, who believes: "If, as some authors suggest, a series of expenses, losses, and non-productive expenses determined by the quality of enterprise work are removed from the composition of costs, the product costs will be falsely reduced, and the work of the enterprise will appear to be smooth. Such a 'cost' is not a weapon to improve the quality of work of the factory collective, but on the contrary, it is a means to obscure various shortcomings in the work of the enterprise. The cost of industrial products should include all expenses for the production and sales of such products, regardless of their nature." (Ibid., first issue of 1956)

Third, is there a departmental average product cost? From what perspective should the issue of product cost be examined?

This question is also closely related to the issue of the essence of product cost. The first opinion is that since product cost, in its economic essence, is socially necessary consumption, it should not be examined from the perspective of a single enterprise, but from the perspective of social production. Therefore, the departmental average cost objectively exists. For example, Ke. Dimitrov believes that "since cost is an economic category, then, obviously, we are concerned not with the cost of a certain enterprise, but with social cost." (Ibid., first issue of 1956) A. Omarov and Ge. Grigoryan believe that "the departmental average cost is the expression of social consumption in the corresponding industrial sector." (Ibid., first issue of 1956)

Le Contaire holds a different view. He believes that since product cost is the total number of various actual consumption in the production of products in an enterprise, the cost issue should be examined from the perspective of the enterprise. Therefore, the departmental average cost does not actually exist, but is merely a statistical concept. He pointed out: "The cost of a product is based on the specific working conditions of each enterprise, and the costs of various regions of the country cannot be unified, because the production costs of the same product produced by different enterprises will not be the same. Therefore, one of the important tasks of compiling a cost plan is to correctly estimate the characteristics of the work of each enterprise. The so-called departmental average cost is merely the average cost of each enterprise in a certain production department, and therefore it is only a statistical concept." (Ibid., tenth issue of 1954)

Fourth, how is the cost of a product determined? What role does the socialist state play in the determination of costs?

One opinion is that the cost of a product is objectively determined by the consumption in the production of the product, and the objective basis of the product cost of each enterprise is the individual value of the product. Those who advocate this view criticize those who overemphasize the regulatory role of the socialist state on the cost level and cost composition as having a subjective tendency. For example, Vo. Gadirobel and Vo. Ganstack said: "The objective basis for the different costs of the same product in different enterprises is ultimately the individual value and individual production consumption." (Ibid., first issue of 1956) Ke. Dimitrov criticized those who overemphasize the state's regulatory role on costs as "analyzing costs in accordance with subjectivism." (Ibid., first issue of 1956) Ye. Ivanov also criticized the view that the socialist state can arbitrarily include or exclude certain expenses in the cost.

Le Contaire relatively emphasized the regulatory role of the socialist state on the cost level and cost composition. He believes: "The socialist state plans and regulates the level and composition of costs according to the socialist economic laws and the specific tasks of the national economy. From the perspective of the interests of the state, it can include certain expenses of the state in the cost of industrial products. Conversely, it can also include certain expenses of industry in the state budget... Therefore, the product cost of industry is directly affected by the regulatory role of the socialist state." (Ibid., tenth issue of 1954)

Fifth, what is the relationship between product cost and product value? In addition to the quantitative difference between them, is there a qualitative difference?

One opinion is that product cost is a part of the socially necessary consumption of the product, that is, the value of the product. Therefore, product cost and product value are basically homogeneous, with only quantitative differences. For example, Le. Yakhnin believes that the difference between product cost and product value lies in "the former is only a part of the production consumption paid by the economically accountable enterprise in the production of products in monetary form, and the latter includes all labor consumption, a part of which becomes accumulation and profit." (Le. Yakhnin: "Principles of Technical and Economic Analysis of Socialist Industrial Costs," National Light Industry Publishing House, 1953 Russian edition.) Vo. Ganstack stipulated the following formula for the relationship between product value and product cost in a pamphlet written earlier: "The value of a commodity is equal to the cost plus the value of the surplus product." (Vo. Ganstack: "Product Cost and Its Ways to Reduce It," Sverdlov Publishing House, 1948 Russian edition)

Another opinion is that product cost and product value are not only different in quantity, but also different in quality. Because value is determined by socially necessary consumption, while cost is the actual consumption of each enterprise, they are two different categories. Product cost includes those non-productive consumption that do not form product value, while on the other hand, some expenses that belong to socially necessary consumption (such as the organization costs of new production, the exploration costs of raw materials and fuel, etc.) are not included in the product cost. For example, Le Contaire said: "It is wrong to think that product cost is a part of value, that it is essentially the same as value, and therefore can only depend on socially necessary consumption. Value and cost are different not only in quantity, but also in quality."
