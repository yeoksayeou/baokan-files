    The Act of Covering One's Ears While Stealing a Bell
    To the Editor:
    Recently, a strange cotton oil spring was discovered in Xinjiangou, Songzi County, Hubei Province. People who come here only need to dig a hole one and a half feet deep in the ground, and they can scoop up about ten catties of cotton oil a day.
    Where does this cotton oil come from? According to the local people, a layer of black oil has been floating on the pond here a long time ago. In early April, after several days of continuous rain, oil also appeared on the land by the pond and flowed towards the lower ground with the rain. At this time, some people began to study the source of the oil and found that it was "cotton oil" leaking from the oil pool of the Songzi County Oil and Fat Company.
    The manager of the county oil and fat company quickly learned about this discovery by the masses. The construction of this oil pool was not approved by the higher authorities, and the storage of oil was also not approved by the higher authorities. The manager realized that he had done something wrong, so he quickly took out the oil from the oil pool. As for the leaked oil, he thought it was too troublesome to recover, so he simply wrote it off. However, the masses began to scoop up the oil, with hundreds of people doing so day and night, and the news spread further and further. Fearing that the news would spread, the manager took "emergency measures" on April 14, pouring manure and covering yellow soil in the holes dug by the masses to scoop up oil. This practice made the masses very dissatisfied. They said: You don't want the good oil, why would you rather let the yellow soil eat it than allow others to scoop it up?
    How much cotton oil was lost this time? It is said that it is nearly ten thousand catties.　Liu Shijun

    掩耳盗铃的行为编辑同志：
    湖北松滋县新江口最近发现了一个奇怪的棉油泉。人们到这里只要在地上挖一个一尺五寸深的窟窿，一天就能够捞到十斤左右的棉油。
    这些棉油究竟是从那里流出来的呢？据当地群众说：很早以前，这里的水塘上就漂着黑黑的一层油。四月上旬连续下了几天雨，水塘边的土地上也出现了油，随着雨水向低处流。这时有人开始研究油的来源，才发现这是松滋县油脂公司油池里漏出来的“棉油”。
    群众的这个发现，县油脂公司的经理也很快知道了。这个油池在建造时没有经过上级同意，装油时也没有经过上级批准。这一下经理同志才知道事情做错了，就赶快把油池的油取出来。至于漏掉的油，他嫌回收麻烦，就干脆报销了。但是，群众却开始捞起油来，每天成百个人，日夜不断，而且消息越传越远。经理怕风声传出去，在四月十四日就采取了“紧急措施”，把群众为了捞油而挖的窟窿里都泼上大粪、掩上黄土。这种做法使群众很不满意。他们说：好好的油，你们公司不要了，为什么宁可让黄土吃了，而不许别人捞呢？
    这次损失的棉油有多少呢？据说将近一万斤。　刘世俊
