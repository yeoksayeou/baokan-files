Take Back Your "Shield"
　　Jin Zhongyi

Since 1954, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Sintering General Plant has not completed its national plan. The state supervisory body sent a special inspection team to investigate. On the first day the inspection team arrived, the plant director, Ding Yaoxuan, said to the comrades of the inspection team: "It's great that you've come to inspect. But let me introduce the situation of the plant. Now, all the workers in the plant lack confidence in completing the production task because the ore from Dagushan cannot be supplied according to plan." The director didn't say how much the failure to supply Dagushan ore according to plan affected the completion of the production task. However, since all the workers had this opinion, the responsibility for not completing the production task should be borne by Dagushan.

After the comrades of the inspection team spent a few days visiting the workshops, they discovered that the situation was different from what the director had said. For example, many workers and technicians said that the production task could not be completed if the problem of the gas burner was not solved. What exactly was a gas burner? Why did it have such a big impact? This aroused the interest of the inspection team.

The gas burner is an important piece of equipment on the sintering machine in this factory, and it was manufactured according to Soviet blueprints. However, some comrades in this factory didn't like it very much because it was too "unruly." Last year, some comrades suggested removing this "thing" and replacing it with another combustion device left over from the puppet Manchukuo period, arguing that "although the puppet Manchukuo equipment had innate shortcomings and limited heating capacity, it was more 'obedient.'" The director agreed with this suggestion and replaced the puppet Manchukuo equipment on one sintering machine and actively prepared to continue replacing it on the second. When this news reached the Soviet expert stationed in the plant, the expert rushed to advise against it. The director accepted the advice and only replaced one machine. After the replaced machine was used for twenty days, the output was greatly reduced, and it was taken down again.

Now, this gas burner has to be overhauled twice a month on average, which people call "planned maintenance." Each overhaul requires a shutdown of twenty or forty hours, and in addition to planned maintenance, there are also two or three accident repairs per month. According to Soviet experts, in the Soviet Union, this type of equipment is only planned to be overhauled every six months to two years. So why does this factory overhaul it so often? This also aroused the concern of the inspection team.

The comrades of the inspection team found several "Major Equipment Accident Report Forms" submitted by the plant at different times. The forms stated that the cause of the gas burner accidents was almost always the same: the nozzle of the gas burner was burned through because the quality of the refractory bricks was not good. The report form did not explain why the quality of the refractory bricks was not good. It should be mentioned here that the director's large and clear seal was stamped at the bottom of each form.

One day, the comrades of the inspection team inadvertently discovered a pile of refractory bricks in an open space. It looked like these bricks had been placed there for a long time. The bricks were covered with dust, but the "scars" caused by impact were still visible, and the markings B3 and B4 on the bricks were faintly discernible. The comrades of the inspection team suddenly remembered what the old worker had told him: "The quality of the refractory bricks used in the gas burner is very poor, especially the B3, B4, and B5 shaped refractory bricks. The nozzle of the gas burner often fails because they are damaged. These bricks are not stored well and no one cares about them. Also, once, bricks that were not completely fired in the kiln, still hot to the touch, were transported back for use. The quality of these bricks is like tofu dregs."

The next morning, it rained, and the comrades of the inspection team specially went to the place where the bricks were placed to check. Except that the dust on the bricks had turned into wet mud, everything was the same as before. The comrades of the inspection team asked Old Han in the spare parts warehouse why he still left the refractory bricks outdoors to be rained on. Old Han said:
"Is that so? I'll notify the sintering workshop to move them away immediately."
"How long have these bricks been here?"
"Ah! Only about half a month!"

On the third day, the comrades of the inspection team passed another place and saw two small houses built with galvanized iron sheets in front of them. Above and parallel to these two small houses, there was a very long and high wooden frame, with a long row of wooden flumes on the frame. The tailings water discharged from the ore dressing workshop flowed through here day and night. Some of the water often overflowed from the flumes and wet the ground. The comrades of the inspection team stepped forward and saw that the B5 type refractory bricks stored in the room were all soaked in thin mud. The B3 and B4 type refractory bricks that were placed outdoors yesterday were lying beside them. The comrades of the inspection team walked to another small galvanized iron sheet house and saw seven workers scraping the wet mud off the refractory bricks one by one and placing them in the sun to dry. It turned out that various refractory bricks of different sizes in this small house were also buried in wet mud. The comrades of the inspection team counted the refractory bricks that were excavated, totaling more than 15,000 pieces!

The reason why the gas burner was "unruly" was here. The comrades of the inspection team ran excitedly to see the director. The director was sitting on the sofa in the office, pondering leisurely. The comrades of the inspection team rushed to the director and said, "Director Ding, our plant's refractory bricks are not being stored well! Please go and take a look!" Then they reported what they had seen and heard in the past few days. The director sat motionless on the sofa. He slowly said to the comrades of the inspection team:

Our plant has more serious problems than this. "For example, three rooms of refractory bricks in the pelletizing workshop were flooded by water yesterday." The director quickly changed the subject. He said: "Comrades of the inspection team, have you helped us report to the higher authorities about the fact that Dagushan ore is not being supplied according to plan?" The comrades of the inspection team now realized that the director was thinking about other people's problems every day, and the problems of his own plant were "insignificant"!

Currently, it is no longer a matter of insufficient supply of Dagushan ore, but rather an oversupply. The plant is worried about how to deal with the continuous flow of raw materials. However, because the problem of the gas burner has not been solved, that is, the problem of refractory brick storage has not been solved, the production task is still not being completed.

There are still some leading comrades in our enterprises who do not carefully analyze and study the situation of the enterprise in their daily work, do not conduct in-depth inspections of the key problems of the enterprise, and do not rely on workers and engineers to solve them. After causing serious losses to production, they still treat production with a bureaucratic attitude, complaining that this person does not create conditions for him, and complaining that that unit does not cooperate with him well. Every one of our enterprises has to contact other enterprises. Emphasizing and exaggerating objective difficulties is the "easiest thing to do." But this is a very disgraceful "shield." We advise comrades with these "common problems" to quickly take back this disgraceful "shield"! First, look at, and look more at, the shortcomings of your own work!

    收回你的“挡箭牌”吧
    靳仲毅
    鞍山钢铁公司烧结总厂从1954年以来都没有完成国家计划。国家监察机关特派一个检查组去检查。检查组到达的第一天，厂长丁耀轩就向检查组的同志说道：“你们来检查，那是再好也没有了。不过我向你们介绍一下厂子的情况，现在全厂职工都因为大孤山的矿石不能按计划供应，对完成生产任务的信心不大。”究竟大孤山矿石没有按计划供应影响生产任务完成的程度有多大，厂长虽然没介绍，不过，既然全厂职工都有这个意见，生产任务完不成的责任，就应该由大孤山来承担了。
    检查组的同志到车间跑了几天之后，发觉情况跟厂长谈的有出入。比如很多工人和技术员都说瓦斯燃烧器的问题不解决，生产任务就没法完成。瓦斯燃烧器究竟是个什么东西呢？为什么影响这样大？这引起了检查人员的兴趣。
    瓦斯燃烧器是这个工厂烧结机上的一个重要设备，它是根据苏联图纸制造的。不过这个工厂有些同志很不喜欢它，原因是它太不“听话”。去年有的同志提议把这个“捞什子”取掉，换上伪满时期留下的另一种燃烧设备，理由是“伪满那套设备虽然先天不足，发热能力有限，但是它比较‘听话’。”厂长很同意这个建议，便把伪满的那套设备在一台烧结机上换上了，并且又积极准备继续更换第二台。这个消息传到驻厂的苏联专家那里，专家便赶来劝告。厂长接受劝告：只换了一台。更换了的那一台，使用了二十几天，产量大大减低，才又把它拿下来。
    现在这套瓦斯燃烧器平均每月要检修二次，人们说这是“计划检修”。每检修一次就要停产二十几小时或者四十几小时，每月除计划检修之外，还要进行二三次的事故检修。据苏联专家说，在苏联，这种设备每半年到二年才计划检修一次。那么该厂为什么老检修呢？这又引起了检查组同志的关心。
    检查组的同志找到了几张不同时期的该厂上报的“重大设备事故报告表”。表上记载着瓦斯燃烧器发生事故的原因，几乎都异口同声地说：瓦斯燃烧器的火咀被烧穿，原因是耐火砖的质量不好。耐火砖的质量为什么不好，报告表上没有说明。在这里要附带提一下的就是在每张表的下端都盖上了厂长的巨大而清晰的印鉴。
    有一天，检查组的同志在一块空地上无意中发现一堆耐火砖。看样子这些砖已经是放置很久了，砖上落满了灰土，但是仍然看得出因为撞击而带来的“斑斑伤痕”，砖上面的B3和B4字样还依稀可辨；检查组的同志忽然记起了老工人向他说过的话：“瓦斯燃烧器使用的耐火砖质量很不好，特别是B3，B4，B5三种异形耐火砖，瓦斯燃烧器的火咀经常因为它们被烧坏而发生事故，这些砖保管得很不好，也无人过问。还有一次，在窑里未烧透的砖，摸着还烫手，就运回来使用，这些砖的质量就像豆腐渣一样”。
    第二天上午天下起雨来，检查组同志特地到放砖的地方察看一下，除了砖上的灰土变成湿泥外，还是那个老样子。检查组同志问备品库的老韩，为什么还把耐火砖放在露天让雨淋呀。老韩说：
    “是这样吗？我马上通知烧结车间搬走。”
    “这些砖来了多少时候啦？”
  “啊！不过才半个月吧！”
    第三天检查组同志又走过一个地方，看见前方有两座用白铁皮搭盖的小房屋，在和这两座小房屋成平行线的上空，有一个很长很高的木架，架上是一长列木制的流水槽，选矿车间排出的尾矿水，日夜川流不息地从这里流过去，有一部分水经常从水槽中溢出，把地面浇湿。检查组同志上前一看，只见室内储存的B5型耐火砖都泡在稀泥中，昨天在露天放置的B3、B4型耐火砖则躺在旁边。检查组同志走到另一座白铁皮的小屋前，看见有七个工人正在把一块一块的耐火砖上面的湿泥刮干净，然后放在太阳里曝晒。原来这间小屋的各种大大小小不同的耐火砖也被湿泥埋藏了。检查组同志把挖掘出来的耐火砖数了一下，共计是一万五千多块！
    瓦斯燃烧器“不听话”的原因就在这里。检查组同志有点激动地跑去见厂长。厂长坐在办公室的沙发上悠然深思。检查组同志冲到厂长跟前说：“丁厂长，咱们厂的耐火砖保管得很不好呀！请你去看看吧！”接着就把这几天所看见的和听到的情况汇报了一番。厂长坐在沙发上一动不动。他慢吞吞地向检查组的同志说道：
    咱厂比这更严重的问题有的是。“比如团矿车间昨天就有三间房屋的耐火砖被水淹了。”厂长很快转移了话锋。他说：“检查组同志，大孤山矿石没按计划供应，这个情况你们帮我们向上级反映了没有？”检查组同志现在才恍然大悟，原来厂长每天想的都是别人的问题，至于本厂的问题都是“不足挂齿”的！
      目前已经不是大孤山矿石供应不足，而是供过于求了。这个厂正在发愁怎样对待源源不断到来的原料。但是，因为瓦斯燃烧器的问题没解决，也就是耐火砖的保管问题没解决，生产任务依然完不成。
    我们现在还有一些企业的领导同志，在日常工作中不认真分析和研究企业的情况，对企业的关键问题不深入检查，不依靠工人和工程技术人员解决，等到给生产造成严重的损失以后，仍然用官僚主义的态度来对待生产，埋怨这个人不给他创造条件，埋怨那个单位不好好配合他。我们每一个企业都要同其他企业发生联系，强调和夸大客观困难，是最“轻而易举”的。但是这是一块十分不光彩的“挡箭牌”。我们奉劝有这些“通病”的同志，赶快收回这块不光彩的“挡箭牌”吧！首先看看，并且多看看自己工作的缺点吧！
