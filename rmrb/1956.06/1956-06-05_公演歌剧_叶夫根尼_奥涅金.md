Xinhua News Agency – Beijing. The famous Russian opera "Eugene Onegin" began public performances in Beijing on the evening of the 3rd.

This performance is the first attempt by teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music under the guidance of Soviet experts Mr. and Mrs. P.M. Medvedev and V.F. Balashoff.

This performance includes the six main scenes of the opera. The main roles are played in rotation by two groups of actors. Wei Qixian and Jiang Jiaxiang play Onegin, Liang Meizhen and Tao Liling play Tatyana, and Li Jia Yao and Xie Zhilin play Lensky. Each has their own strengths, and they all sing and perform the characters' personalities and inner worlds very well in Chinese.

In late May, the Central Conservatory of Music performed the opera "Eugene Onegin" in Tianjin, which was well received by people from all walks of life. After the news of their scheduled performances in Beijing on the 3rd and 4th spread, the theater tickets were sold out within two hours. To meet the demands of Beijing audiences, they decided to add two more performances on the evenings of the 5th and 6th.

Huang Feili is the conductor for this performance, and Zhang Hongmo is the translator and arranger of the opera.
