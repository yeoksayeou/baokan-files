    Let the Railway Pass Through Where We Tread
    Chen Keyi
    In late December of last year, all the staff of the First Dispatch Detachment of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, after completing the survey and design tasks for the Litang-Zhanjiang Railway and the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, gradually gathered in the northern mountainous region of Guizhou. With the warm reception and strong support of the local people, they braved the winter cold in the mountains, erected giant drilling rigs on cliffs and in deep forests, on mountains 1,500 meters high, and carried out the exploration work of the Sichuan-Guizhou line day and night.

    Liangfeng Pass, the throat of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, stands among the peaks of the Dalou Mountains. It is said that a 3,400-meter tunnel will be built here, which is the key project of the entire line. A 3,400-meter tunnel is currently the longest and largest tunnel in the country, more than 1,000 meters longer than the famous Qinling Tunnel on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Selecting and aligning the route here is very difficult. For example, in the section from Liangfeng Pass to Xinzhan, which is only more than 30 kilometers long, the slope difference from south to north is more than 500 meters, making it almost impossible for locomotives to run on it. There are also dissolved limestone badlands on the line. However, due to the technical personnel's active learning of advanced Soviet experience and finding ways to overcome difficulties, they adopted the route selection method of more investigation, more research, and more comparison under extremely difficult working conditions, and made various plans for repeated comparison. In order to obtain accurate and reliable geological data, geological technicians sometimes risked drilling into collapsed sinkholes hundreds of meters deep that no one had ever entered before for surveying.

    The Niukoushi section, which the route survey must pass through, has a 15-kilometer-long steep and dangerous canyon. In order to complete the survey task, the members of the Third Detachment, who were responsible for surveying this section, climbed cliffs and steep walls 400 to 500 meters high and used ropes to secure their bodies for high-altitude operations. During high-altitude operations, they also came up with advanced working methods such as the "double mirror intersection method," "fixed intersection method," and "unmanned targeting method" to improve work efficiency.

    The working place of all the members of the Fifth Detachment was on a peak 1,600 meters above sea level. The terrain here is rugged and the climate is harsh. They encounter drizzling rain and fog every day. The team members put forward the fighting slogans of "suspend work in heavy rain, persist in light rain" and "overcome the fog and seize the time," and launched a labor competition. The youth terrain assault team and other terrain assault teams adopted rapid measurement methods, averaging 1.45 kilometers per day, with a maximum of 1.8 kilometers, increasing work efficiency by 50%, and completing the initial survey task of 60 kilometers within 15 days, ensuring the needs of various route selection plan data research in a timely manner.

    The survey team members lived in tents in the mountains and fields because they had no houses to live in, and ate pickles because they had no fresh vegetables to eat; they often could not eat hot meals or drink hot water. However, the team members never complained. They said: We will use our arduous steps to pave the way for the future large number of builders, and let the railway pass through where we tread!

    At present, the field detailed survey work of the northern section of the Sichuan-Guizhou line is nearing completion, and the overall design work has begun.

    让铁路从我们踏过的地方通过
    陈科义
    去年十二月底，铁道部第二设计院第一派遣总队的全体职工，在完成黎（塘）湛（江）铁路和鹰（潭）厦（门）铁路的勘测设计任务以后，就陆续会集到贵州北部山区。他们在当地人民热情接待和大力支援下，冒着山区冬季的严寒，在悬崖峭壁上，在深山密林中，在一千五百公尺高的山上，架起了巨型的钻探机，不分昼夜地进行川黔线路的勘探工作。
    川黔铁路的咽喉——凉风垭，矗立在大娄山的群峰中。据说在这里要开筑一个三千四百公尺的隧道，这是全线的重点工程。三千四百公尺的隧道，目前在全国来讲是最长最大的隧道，比宝成铁路著名的秦岭隧道还长一千多公尺。在这里选线，定线非常困难。如从凉风垭到新站仅仅三十多公里的一段，从南到北的坡度就相差五百多公尺，机车几乎无法在上面行驶。线路上又有溶解的石灰岩不良地带。但是，由于技术人员积极学习苏联先进经验，想办法，在极端困难的工作条件下，他们采取多调查、多研究、多比较的选线方法，做出多种方案，反复比较。为了获得正确可靠的地质资料，地质技术人员有时要冒险钻入从来没有人进去过的、数百公尺深的、容易坍塌的溶洞内去勘察。
    线路勘测必须经过的牛口石地段，那里有一段十五公里长的陡险峡谷。负责勘测这一地段的第三分队队员们为了完成勘测任务，爬上四、五百公尺高的悬崖陡壁上，用绳索栓住自己的身体进行高空作业。在高空作业中，他们还想出了“双镜交点法”、“固定交点法”、“无人对点法”等先进工作方法来提高工作效率。
    第五分队的全体队员们的工作地方是在拔海一千六百公尺的高峰上。这里地形险峻，气候恶劣，每天都要碰到霪雨和迷雾。队员们提出了“大雨暂停，小雨坚持”、
  “战胜迷雾，争取时间”的战斗口号，开展了劳动竞赛。青年地形突击组和其他地形突击组采取了快速测量法，平均日进1.45公里，最高达到1.8公里，提高工作效率50％，在十五天内完成了六十公里的初测任务，及时保证了各种选线方案资料研究的需要。
    勘测队员没有房子住，就在山野里搭起帐篷，没有鲜菜吃，就吃咸菜；经常吃不到热饭，喝不到热水。但是，队员们从来没有叫过苦。他们说：我们要用我们的艰苦步伐为未来的大批建设者开辟道路，让铁路从我们踏过的地方通过！
    目前，川黔线北段的外业定测工作已将近完成，全面设计工作已经开始。
