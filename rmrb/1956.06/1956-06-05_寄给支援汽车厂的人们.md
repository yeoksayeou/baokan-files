    To the People Supporting the Automobile Factory
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    Every day we spend at the First Automobile Works, it seems as if we constantly hear the leaping footsteps of our great motherland. This sound comes from within the automobile factory, and also from all over the country. When we see the window glass sent from Shanghai, so strong that three people standing on it cannot break it, when we learn that the automobile materials successfully trial-produced by Chongqing 102 Steel Plant have already flowed through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, when we hear that the engineers of the First Automobile Parts Factory are staying up late at night to check the reasons for the failure of the thermostat trial production, our hearts are stirred, as if we see thousands of people across the country attacking technical fortresses, promoting the growth of the automobile industry.
    Hundreds of factories are producing various materials and collaborative products that have never existed before for the automobile industry. Changchun Small Hardware Factory has been able to produce only small parts such as cotter pins for many years. Two years ago, this factory bravely accepted the trial production task of automobile parts. At that time, people worried whether it could be successfully trial-produced. However, two years later, this small factory with outdated equipment and backward technology has been able to produce more than 70 kinds of automobile parts. Because of the need to mass-produce automobile parts, the factory expanded its buildings, added workers and equipment, and quickly became an automobile parts manufacturing factory with modern technology.
    When the Technical Research Office of the Lüda Municipal Industrial Bureau promised to trial-produce automobile steering wheels, there were only a dozen people. At that time, some people doubted: "How can this be done? I am afraid that even after seven years of trial production, a qualified steering wheel will not be produced." However, the dozen or so people in this Technical Research Office did not believe this argument. They tried for two years, shed a lot of sweat, failed dozens of times, and finally succeeded. Today, if you go to Dalian, you can see a newly built Dalian Plastics Factory with hundreds of people, which will mass-produce steering wheels.
    We were so worried when we first heard that many factories did not dare to trial-produce spark plugs. Because without spark plugs, how can a car start? But in just a few months, we saw in the laboratory of the automobile factory that the spark plugs trial-produced by Nanjing Electric Porcelain Factory had been identified as qualified.
    The automotive collaborative products produced by these factories will be assembled into domestically produced automobiles. Today, standing in the automobile factory, we have already seen more than 300 collaborative products being shipped in. We will soon have our own automobile manufacturing industry, and at the same time, we must also have our own domestically produced automobile materials and collaborative products.
    Of course, there are still serious difficulties in producing and supplying all the materials and collaborative products for automobiles. Many automobile materials and collaborative products have now been successfully trial-produced, but there are still many products that cannot be supplied in large quantities. There are still 82 automobile collaborative products that have not been successfully trial-produced. Especially serious is the issue of metallic materials. Many metallic materials required by automobiles still rely on supplies from the Soviet Union. Even for metallic materials that can be produced domestically, there are dozens of types that have not been produced. At present, some production workshops in the automobile factory have been unable to produce automobile parts according to plan due to the lack of some steel and collaborative products. This difficulty in supplying automobile materials and collaborative products hinders the country from producing automobiles ahead of schedule, and may hinder the development of the automobile industry for a certain period of time.
    This is a difficulty on our road to progress.
    How should we deal with this difficulty? Should we retreat? Absolutely not. Quickly producing the metallic materials and collaborative products needed by the automobile industry is not only related to whether we can produce automobiles ahead of schedule at present, but also related to whether we can build a strong automobile and tractor manufacturing industry in our country in the future. Therefore, striving to mass-produce and supply most automobile materials and all collaborative products in the shortest possible time is a major task. Manufacturing automobiles requires more than 950 specifications of metallic materials and 410 collaborative products. The value of collaborative products for each automobile accounts for one-third of the total cost. Manufacturing a heavy-duty truck requires more than 4,100 kilograms of metallic materials. If we want to manufacture 20,000 automobiles a year, then we will need more than 80,000 tons of metallic materials a year. We are building the First Tractor Manufacturing Factory, and we will also build the Second Automobile Manufacturing Factory. In the future, the need for metallic materials and collaborative products will become more and more. What will happen if we rely on foreign supplies of materials and collaborative products for a long time? On the one hand, due to the long distance and transportation difficulties, we cannot guarantee that automobile production will proceed rhythmically; on the other hand, due to supply difficulties, we have to increase reserves, waste foreign exchange, accumulate funds, and increase the cost of automobiles. At the same time, we cannot quickly improve the level of industrial technology.
    Of course, there will be many technical and equipment difficulties in producing automobile materials and collaborative products. In the past two years, due to the opposition to conservative thinking, many automobile materials that were previously considered impossible to manufacture have also been made. In the future, to produce all automobile materials and collaborative products, we must fight against the conservative thinking that does not seek progress in technology. Is there any conservative thinking on this issue now? Yes, there is. Let's take a prominent example! In March last year, the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory ordered a seamless steel pipe from Anshan Iron and Steel; this steel pipe must not only have an upper limit of hardness, but also have a lower limit of hardness. Some comrades at Anshan Iron and Steel believed that there had never been a lower limit hardness requirement in the past, and therefore refused to manufacture it. Later, someone hoped that Anshan Iron and Steel would produce it first; if the lower limit hardness requirement was not met, measures could be studied. Some comrades at Anshan Iron and Steel still disagreed. After dragging on and on, and discussing repeatedly, the contract was not signed until December last year. Up to now, this seamless steel pipe with a lower limit hardness has not been produced. This example is not an isolated one. Some comrades in steel plants shrink back as soon as they hear of products with strict technical requirements, fearing that "if we promise to supply now, we will be passive in the future," so they look for excuses, or push things away, or ask to lower quality standards. Because of these reasons, some steel supply contracts cannot be signed for a long time, and some steel that should have been supplied domestically has to be ordered from abroad. There are also some people who are afraid that trial-producing automobile collaborative products will affect the completion of production tasks and hinder the realization of financial plans, so they do not actively lead and organize trial-production work. At present, some electrical collaborative products have not been trial-produced for a long time due to insufficient attention. These conservative ideas have seriously affected the timely supply of automobile materials and collaborative products.
    The first batch of domestically produced automobiles will be manufactured in the third quarter of this year. If we want to be able to continuously produce high-quality domestically produced automobiles, we not only need all the workers of the automobile factory to learn technology and manage the factory well, but also need the strong support of factories across the country to produce and supply automobile materials and collaborative products in a timely manner.

    寄给支援汽车厂的人们  
    本报记者　陈迹
    我们在第一汽车制造厂的每一天，好像时时刻刻都听到伟大祖国跃进的脚步声。这个脚步声，来自汽车厂厂内，也来自全国各地。当我们看见三个人站在上面都压不碎的上海送来的封窗玻璃的时候，当我们知道重庆一零二钢厂试制成功的汽车材料已经流过长江三峡的时候，当我们听说第一汽车配件厂工程师深夜不眠还在检查恒温器试制失败的原因的时候，我们的心都在激动，好像看到全国成千上万的人在攻破技术堡垒，推动汽车工业的成长。
    成百个工厂，都在为汽车工业生产着各种各样的过去没有过的材料和协作产品。长春小五金厂，许多年来只能生产插梢等小零件。两年以前，这个工厂勇敢地接受了汽车配件的试制任务。那时候人们耽心它能不能试制成功。但是，两年以后的今天，这个设备陈旧、技术落后的小工厂，已经能够生产七十多项汽车配件。因为要大量生产汽车配件，工厂扩大了厂房，增添了工人和设备，很快变成了一个具有现代技术水平的汽车配件制造厂了。
    旅大市工业局技术研究室答应试制汽车方向盘的时候，只有十多个人。当时有人怀疑：“这怎么行呢？恐怕试制七年，也拿不出合格的方向盘。”然而这个技术研究室的十多个人，不相信这个论调。他们试制了两年，流了许多汗，失败了几十次，终于成功了。今天你到大连去，可以看见一座新建设的拥有上百人的大连塑料厂，就要大量制造方向盘了。
    初次听说许多工厂不敢试制火花塞的时候，我们多么耽忧。因为没有火花塞，汽车怎么发动呢？可是不过几个月的时间，我们在汽车厂的试验室看到南京电瓷厂试制的火花塞已被鉴定合格了。
      这些工厂生产的汽车协作产品，将要装配成国产汽车。今天站在汽车厂，已经见到三百多项协作产品运来了。我们快要有自己的汽车制造工业，同时一定也要有自己生产的汽车材料和协作产品。
    当然，要生产和供应全部汽车的材料和协作产品，还有严重的困难。现在已试制成功了不少汽车材料和协作产品，但还有很多产品不能大量供应。汽车的协作产品，还有八十二项没有试制成功。尤其严重的是金属材料。许多汽车需要的金属材料，还要依靠苏联供应。就是国内能够生产的金属材料，也有几十种没有生产出来。目前汽车厂有些生产车间，已经因为缺少一些钢材和协作产品，不能按计划生产汽车零件。这种汽车材料和协作产品供应不上的困难，妨碍国家提前出产汽车，并且可能在一定时期内阻碍汽车工业的发展。
    这是我们前进道路上的困难。
    怎样对待这种困难呢？退缩吗？绝对不行。赶快生产出汽车工业所需要的金属材料和协作产品，不但关系着目前能否提早出产汽车，而且关系着将来能否建设起我国的强大汽车和拖拉机制造工业。所以争取在最短时间内能够大量生产和供应大部分汽车材料和全部协作产品，是一个重大的任务。制造汽车，需要九百五十多种规格的金属材料和四百一十项协作产品。每辆汽车的协作产品的价值，要占总成本的三分之一。制造一辆载重汽车，就需要四千一百多公斤金属材料。假如一年要制造两万辆汽车，那末一年就需要八万多吨金属材料。我们正在建设第一拖拉机制造厂，并且还要建设第二汽车制造厂。今后需要的金属材料和协作产品，会越来越多。如果长期依靠国外供应材料和协作品，那么会发生什么样的结果呢？一方面因为路途遥远运输困难，不能保证汽车生产有节奏的进行；另方面因为供应困难，不得不增加储备量，浪费外汇，积压资金，增加汽车成本。同时，我们也不能迅速提高工业技术的水平。
    当然，要生产汽车材料和协作产品，会遇到许多技术上设备上的困难。两年多来，由于反对了保守思想，许多过去认为不能制造的汽车材料，也都制成了。今后要全部生产汽车材料和协作产品，要同那种技术上不求长进的保守思想作斗争。在这个问题上，现在有没有保守思想呢？有的。举一个突出的例子来看看吧！去年三月，第一汽车制造厂曾经向鞍钢订购一种无缝钢管；这种钢管不但要有上限的硬度，而且要有下限的硬度。鞍钢有些同志认为过去从来没有下限硬度的要求，因而不肯制造。后来，有人希望鞍钢先生产再说；如果万一达不到下限硬度的要求，可研究措施。鞍钢有些同志还不同意。拖来拖去，反复商量，一直拖到去年十二月才签订合同。到现在为止，这种有下限硬度的无缝钢管，还没有生产出来。这个例子还不是个别的。有些钢铁厂的同志一听见技术要求严格的产品，就畏畏缩缩，害怕“现在答应供应，将来被动”，于是寻找借口，或者一推了事，或者要求降低质量标准。因为这些缘故，有些钢材的供应合同迟迟签订不了，有些本来应该由国内供应的钢材只好向国外订货。还有一些人，他们害怕试制汽车协作产品，会影响生产任务的完成，会妨碍财务计划的实现，所以不积极地领导和组织试制工作。目前有些电器类的协作产品，就是由于重视不够而长期试制不出来。这些保守思想，都严重影响了汽车材料和协作产品的及时供应。
    今年第三季度，就要制造出第一批国产汽车。我们要想能够源源不断地生产出质量优良的国产汽车，不但需要汽车厂全体职工学好技术，管好工厂，而且需要全国各工厂努力支援，及时生产和供应汽车材料和协作产品。
