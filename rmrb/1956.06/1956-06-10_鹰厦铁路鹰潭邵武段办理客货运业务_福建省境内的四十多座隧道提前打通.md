Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th - The Yingtan-Shaowu section of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, which has already been completed, has seen the rumble of passenger and freight trains adding a new scene to the mountainous areas of northern Fujian. This section of the line has been undergoing trial operation since April 17th, and officially began handling passenger and freight transport on June 1st.

According to statistics, from April 17th to June 5th, trains have transported more than 480 tons of fertilizers, flour, and building materials to farmers and urban residents in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian, and transported more than 410 tons of timber, shiitake mushrooms, and rice from here. The use of trains to transport just the aforementioned fertilizers and agricultural products has saved more than 60,000 yuan in circulation costs compared to using trucks.

Shaowu Station is 147 kilometers from Yingtan and is the first central station on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway after entering Fujian Province. Currently, one passenger-freight mixed train runs daily between here and Yingtan Station. Native and special products such as timber, shiitake mushrooms, lotus seeds, dried bamboo shoots, medicinal materials, and rice, which are abundant in the Futun Creek and Jian Creek basins in the upper reaches of the Min River, are continuously gathering here to be transported to all parts of the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th - More than forty major tunnels on the Fujian Province section of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway have been successively completed ahead of schedule by the end of May. This provides a reliable guarantee for the early opening of the entire line by the end of this year.

When breaking through a certain tunnel, the railway soldiers created a new record in tunnel excavation on the Yingxia line, advancing 44.64 meters per day.

    鹰厦铁路鹰潭邵武段办理客货运业务
    福建省境内的四十多座隧道提前打通
    新华社福州9日电　鹰潭—厦门铁路的已经完工的鹰潭—邵武段线路上，隆隆飞驰的客货混合列车，给闽北山区增添了新的景色。这段线路是自四月十七日开始试行通车的，六月一日已经开始办理客货运输业务。
    据统计，自四月十七日到六月五日止，列车已经为闽北山区农民和城镇居民运来了肥田粉、面粉和建筑器材等四百八十多吨，并且从这里运出木材、香菇和稻谷等四百一十多吨。单是上述肥料和农产品等用火车运输后，就比用汽车运输节省了六万多元的流转费用。
    邵武车站距离鹰潭147公里，是鹰潭—厦门铁路进入福建省后的第一个中心车站。目前这里每天和鹰潭车站对开客货混合列车一次。闽江上游的富屯溪、建溪流域盛产的木材、香菇、莲子、笋干、药材和稻谷等土特产品，正在源源不断地向这里集中，以便由此运往全国各地。
    据新华社福州9日电　鹰潭—厦门铁路福建省境线段上的四十多座主要隧道，已在五月底以前相继提前打通了。这为全线提前在今年年底通车提供了可靠保证。
    在打通某隧道时，铁道兵战士创造了日进四十四点六四公尺的鹰厦线上隧道开挖工程新纪录。
