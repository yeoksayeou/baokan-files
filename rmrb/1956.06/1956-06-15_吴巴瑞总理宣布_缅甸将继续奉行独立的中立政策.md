Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 14th: Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe said yesterday: "The Union of Burma will continue to pursue an independent policy of neutrality, and it will strive to establish friendly relations with all countries, thereby helping to establish world peace."

U Ba Swe said when delivering a policy speech to the Chamber of Deputies that the Federal Government will continue to pursue those policies formulated during the tenure of the former Prime Minister U Nu.

The new Prime Minister talked about the contributions of countries like Burma, which have not assumed obligations, to easing world tensions. He said, "The noble efforts of these countries that have not assumed obligations are increasingly being recognized and understood by the people of the world, and this fact itself is something to be pleased about."

When talking about domestic policy, U Ba Swe said that priority would be given to the issue of law, discipline and order in the country. On economic issues, he emphasized the need to fight against rising prices. He also said: "Taking into account the effectiveness of the economic plan, in the future we will only focus on the original plan and not consider expanding the plan."

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon: The "Burma People's Daily" published an editorial on June 10th saying: "Peace is the key to the prosperity of the Union of Burma."

The newspaper said that the restoration of domestic peace in Burma would enable Burma to make the fullest use of its resources. Poverty, economic difficulties and restrictions on trade are all the result of a lack of domestic peace.
