	They Cannot Endure This Kind of Life
	In capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies, female workers, in addition to suffering the cruel exploitation of capitalists along with the broad masses of working people, also suffer all kinds of intolerable discrimination and unfair treatment. Their situation is even more difficult than that of male workers.

	Female Workers' Wages Are Lower Than Male Workers'
	In capitalist countries, workers' wages are already meager, but female workers' wages are even lower than male workers'. According to official statistics, in the United States, the average wage of female workers is 29% lower than the average wage of male workers; in the United Kingdom, it is 39%–41% lower; in France, 14%–17% lower; in West Germany, 37% lower; in Italy, 19% lower; and in Japan, 56% lower. Female workers' wages are lower than male workers' because these countries almost without exception adopt a discriminatory attitude towards female workers, do not implement equal pay for equal work, and have unfair treatment in the grading and promotion of female workers. Female workers who perform the same work as male workers cannot receive the same wages. Currently, the average wage of an ordinary female worker in the United States is 30%–40% lower than that of a male worker doing the same job, while that of a Black female worker is about 40% lower than that of a white female worker. In a General Electric factory in Canada, female coil winders earn only $1.26 for winding two bundles of wire, while male workers earn $1.48 for winding one bundle of wire. Capitalists obtain huge extra profits from the discrimination against female workers. The American "People's World" once calculated: "If all the working women in the United States were suddenly replaced by men, then the bosses would have to pay an extra $10 billion more than they do now."

		Cruel "Speed-Up System"
	In addition to lowering wages, capitalists also try to extend the working hours of female workers and increase labor intensity as much as possible, regardless of the physiological characteristics and life safety of female workers. In order to squeeze the sweat and blood of female workers as much as possible, capitalists do not hesitate to use various inhumane methods. In Japan's largest textile factory, Kanebo Spinning Mill, capitalists ordered female workers to wear ice skates and shuttle back and forth in the workshop like shuttles, in order to adapt to the accelerated machine speed. A female worker in a Japanese yarn factory described this terrible "speed-up system" as follows: "I have to walk thirty-two kilometers a day to manage my machines." In the telephone factory of the International Telephone Company in Paris, capitalists attempted to tie the wrists of female workers to the machines in order to speed up the work as much as possible. Under this inhuman slave labor, the bodies of female workers are greatly damaged, and their diseases and premature aging are becoming increasingly serious. A female employee representative of a large electrical workshop in Canada said: "Not a day goes by that I am not called to the washroom to calm down female workers who are hysterically crying or sobbing due to complete nervous exhaustion." A female employee representative of a light bulb factory said: "There are very few days when a female worker in the heating process is not carried to the emergency room because she has fainted."

	No Time to Be Spent As They Wish
	Not only that, but the capitalist "speed-up system" also seriously damages the spiritual life of female workers and restricts their active participation in social activities. Let us listen to the call of a female worker in Canada: "Why don't female workers attend our union meetings? I'll tell you. In the evening, when we drag our tired bodies out of the factory, the only thing we want to do is sleep. We don't want to eat, don't want to think, or be disturbed. It is not surprising that more and more female workers in production positions where the 'speed-up system' is implemented go to hotels after leaving the factory!" After female workers get married and have children, their burden becomes even heavier. Olga Smart, a female worker in a clothing factory in London, described a day in the life of a clothing female worker with family burdens: "Get up very early and be busy making food for the children and husband so that they can eat enough before going to school and work, then rush to the factory, and then rush out again at lunchtime to buy food for the family's dinner, and at the end of the day rush home again, busy cooking, mending, ironing, cleaning, and all the trivial housework that needs to be done." In such a situation, can female workers still have any free time at their disposal?

	No Job Security, No Freedom in Life
	In capitalist countries, women are even more discriminated against in terms of employment, and their jobs are even less secure. Many female workers are fired by capitalists after they become pregnant. Business owners like to hire young female workers without family burdens in order to squeeze more profits from them as much as possible. In Japan, the average working life of female workers is only a little over a year, and it is difficult for female workers over the age of twenty-six to find work. In Romilly, on the banks of the Seine in France, a twenty-four-year-old female worker went to a factory that was recruiting workers to apply for a job two months after being fired, but she received this answer: "You are too old!"

	In some countries, female workers are also subjected to barbaric feudal oppression. The life of female workers in Japanese textile factories is a typical example. These female workers generally live in collective dormitories, and the rules of the dormitories are almost no different from prison rules. Female workers are not allowed to leave the dormitory at night to go to the movies; their private letters are often intercepted and stolen by the factory's dormitory administrators; the books they read are subject to inspection, and they are even completely forbidden to read. The factory also interferes with the interaction between female workers and their relatives and friends, and interferes with female workers' freedom to marry. Of course, they are even less able to enjoy the right to freely participate in trade union activities and social activities.

		Why Not Protest
	A Japanese female worker angrily pointed out: "Why should I endure an unreasonable life without making any protests? Is it just because I am a poor girl?" Yes, female workers in capitalist countries can never tolerate their current situation. More and more female workers are awakening and uniting. They have actively participated in the ranks of the working class struggle. In recent years, the strike movement in capitalist countries has generally risen, which is inseparable from the awareness and active participation of the broad masses of female workers. The convening of the first World Conference of Women Workers in history vividly illustrates the growth of the strength and the strengthening of the unity of female workers from various countries.

### 她们不能忍受这样的生活

    她们不能忍受这样的生活
    在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国中，女工除了同广大劳动群众一道遭受资本家的残酷剥削以外，她们还受到各种不能容忍的歧视和不公平的待遇，她们的处境比男工更为困苦。
      女工工资比男工更低
    在资本主义国家，工人的工资本来就十分微薄，而女工的工资比男工的还要低。据官方统计，在美国，女工平均工资比男工平均工资低29％，英国低39％—41％，法国低14％—17％，西德低37％，意大利低19％，日本则低56％。女工工资低于男工的工资，是因为这些国家几乎没有例外的对女工采取歧视态度，没有实行同工同酬的规定，对女工的评级和提升上有着不公平的待遇。女工担任和男工一样的工作，她们却不能拿到相同的工资。目前美国一个普通女工的工资平均比做同一种工作的男工低30％—40％，而黑人女工又比白人女工约低40％。在加拿大通用电气公司的一家工厂内，卷线女工每卷两捆线只赚1.26元，而男工卷一捆线便赚1.48元。从对女工的歧视中，资本家获得巨大的额外利润。美国“人民世界报”曾经计算过：“假使美国所有的劳动妇女忽然都换成男人的话，那末老板们将要比现在多付出一百亿美元。”
        残酷的“赶快制度”
    除了压低工资之外，资本家还尽量地延长女工的工作时间，提高劳动强度，丝毫不顾女工的生理特点和生命安全。为了尽量榨取女工血汗，资本家不惜使用各种非人道的手段。在日本最大的一家纺织厂——钟渊纺织厂，资本家命令女工穿上跑冰鞋，像穿梭似地在车间滑来滑去，以适应加快了的机器速度。一个日本纱厂的女工描述这种可怕的“赶快制度”说：“我每天为着管我的机器要走三十二公里的路。”在巴黎的国际电话公司的电话工厂里，资本家企图把女工的手腕缚在机器上，以便尽量加快工作速度。在这种惨无人道的奴隶劳动下，女工的身体受到极大的摧残，她们的疾病和未老先衰现象日益严重。加拿大一个大电气车间的女职工代表说：“没有一天我不被叫到洗盥间去平息因神经完全疲惫而在歇斯底里地啼哭或啜泣着的女工。”一家电灯工厂的女职工代表说：“很少有这样一天，加热工序的女工没有一个因为昏倒而被抬到急救室里去。”
      没有由自己支配的时间
    不仅如此，资本主义的“赶快制度”还严重地损害了女工的精神生活，限制了她们积极参加社会活动。让我们听听加拿大一个女工的呼声吧：“为什么女工不参加我们的工会会议呢？我告诉你们。晚上当我们拖着疲乏的身体从工厂里出来时，我们唯一想做的事情就是睡觉。我们不想吃，不愿思想或者被打扰。越来越多的在实行‘赶快制度’的生产岗位上的女工从工厂里出来便走到酒店里，这又有什么奇怪呢！”等到女工结了婚和有了小孩之后，她们的负担就更加沉重了。伦敦一家服装工厂的女工奥尔加·斯麦脱这样描述有家累的服装女工的一天生活：“很早起来就忙着为孩子们和丈夫做饭，好使他们能在上学和上工前吃饱，然后匆忙跑到工厂去，到中饭的时候又再匆忙跑出来去买一家人晚饭吃的东西，到一天结束的时候又匆忙跑回家，忙着做饭、缝补、洗熨、打扫和所有要做的琐碎的家务。”在这样的情况下，女工还能有任何自由支配的时间吗？
    工作无保障，生活无自由
    在资本主义国家，妇女在就业方面更是到处遭到歧视，她们的工作更加没有保障。许多女工怀孕以后便被资本家解雇了。企业主喜欢雇用年轻的和没有家累的女工，以便尽量地从她们身上榨取更多的利润。在日本，女工的平均工作年限只有一年多，二十六岁以上的女工便很难找到工作了。在法国塞纳河畔的罗密利市，一个二十四岁的女工在被解雇了二个月之后，到一家招募工人的工厂去应征，但是她得到这样的回答：“你年纪太大了！”
    在某些国家里，女工还受到野蛮的封建压迫。日本纺织厂的女工生活，便是典型的例子。这些女工一般住在集体宿舍里，宿舍的规则几乎和监狱规则相差无几。女工们晚上不准离开宿舍去看电影；她们的私人信件经常被厂方的宿舍管理员截取和偷阅；她们读的书要受到检查，甚至完全不准读书。厂方还要干涉女工跟亲友们的来往，并且干涉女工结婚的自由。当然，她们更加不能享有自由地参加工会活动和社会活动的权利。
        为什么不提出抗议
    日本的一个女工愤怒地指出：“为什么我要忍受不合理的生活而不提出任何抗议？难道只因为我是一个穷苦的女孩子吗？”是的，资本主义国家的女工，是决不能忍受她们目前的处境的。越来越多的女工觉醒起来，团结起来了。她们积极地参加了工人阶级的斗争行列。近年来资本主义国家罢工运动普遍地日益高涨，这是和广大女工的觉悟和积极参加分不开的。历史上第一次的世界女工会议的召开，生动地说明了各国女工力量的壮大和团结的加强。　（梅）
