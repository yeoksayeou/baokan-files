    Pay Full Attention to National Characteristics During the High Tide of Cooperativization
    ——Speech by Representative Xirao Jiacuo
    I wholeheartedly agree with and support the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I will strive for their thorough implementation.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our ancient civilization with a long history has embarked on the road to revival from decline, and Chinese Buddhism has been shining brightly along with the prosperity of the motherland. Since liberation, Party committees and governments at all levels have conscientiously implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, adopted concrete protective measures for all religions, protected the income of Buddhism, repaired Buddhist monuments and cultural relics, and respected and cared for the religious activities, living conditions, and political status of Buddhists. After the promulgation of the Constitution, the policy of freedom of religious belief was written into the Constitution, and in its implementation, it has been increasingly enriched and better implemented. The vast number of Buddhists of all regions, nationalities, and denominations living in a country with full and genuine freedom of religious belief deeply feel the warmth of the motherland, are widely and closely united around the Party and the People's Government, give play to patriotism and the spirit of universal salvation, and are working hard for the promotion of Buddhism, for the prosperity of the motherland, and for world peace.
    Now, based on some situations I have recently come into contact with and understood, I would like to offer a few opinions for your consideration.
    I. Pay full attention to national characteristics in the high tide of cooperativization: Cooperativization is the only way to improve agriculture and animal husbandry in minority areas and put them on the road to socialism, which is an indisputable truth. However, because of the different levels and methods, there should be differences in the way to go. The key is to be keenly aware of the religious issues of minority nationalities. Our country's policy of freedom of religious belief is a policy that religious personnel are very satisfied with, but local authorities must pay attention to it in practice at all times. Tibetan lamas have a traditional and unchangeable Buddhist rule and habit that they cannot participate in farming. After the land or cattle and sheep of lamas and monasteries are incorporated into the cooperative, it is impossible to obtain remuneration from labor, and some fixed religious expenses are solved by the income of these lands or cattle and sheep. Therefore, the remuneration of their land or cattle and sheep shares should be retained to solve their anxiety and difficulties, this is the first point. Some religious activities of lamas and monasteries have traditionally been borne by a certain tribe, or several villages, or one village, or several households. After the transition to advanced cooperatives, there is a difficulty in finding a person in charge to bear these expenses. In the future, there should be appropriate disposal methods so as not to affect the expenses of such religious activities, this is the second point. Because the general Tibetan people have a strong Buddhist belief, when each tribe or village or household holds religious activities such as almsgiving and prayer to accumulate blessings, they were freely carried out by collectives or individuals in the past. In the future, those that are carried out by collectives should be the responsibility of the cooperative, and those that are carried out by individuals should not be interfered with, and the principle of freedom should be fully implemented, this is the third point. Some monasteries and secular Tibetans have been accustomed to private ownership and individual management for generations and cannot quickly understand and implement the superior collective cooperative system. Therefore, for those who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative, the correct principle of free choice should be implemented. Do not express impatience to join the cooperative or force them to withdraw from the cooperative, and do not discriminate against them because of this, but should give them enthusiastic help, this is the fourth point. In short, because the Tibetan people have a strong conservatism towards local customs and have always been accustomed to adhering to the old, it is not surprising that they are somewhat conservative about cooperativization, a new thing that they have never heard of. In promoting new things in such an objective environment, we should have a high degree of patience. If conditions are not yet ripe and we are eager for success, it will be very unfavorable to both the public and the private. The concept of private ownership is an old idea of thousands of years, and it is not easy to eliminate it. Especially at the beginning of every new thing, we should move forward steadily. If it is necessary to slow down temporarily, we should slow down and not pursue figures. First of all, we must strive to do a good job in propaganda and education, create typical examples, establish faith, and gradually improve. When the time is ripe, we will undoubtedly accept the transformation automatically and happily. This is a slow start and fast finish approach. If we are eager for success in carrying out the great socialist transformation in ethnic minority areas, and we do not pay enough attention to the economic conditions of national characteristics and religious beliefs, so that it is inconvenient for some Tibetan people in religious activities such as almsgiving, which has led to difficulties in the lives and religious activities of some monasteries and lamas, making some monasteries and lamas feel economically distressed, and therefore worry that the source of lamas will gradually decrease or even be cut off, thus causing dissatisfaction with the government. For example, in some Tibetan areas in Sichuan recently, the handling of land reform, monastery business tax, and government money, as well as land and livestock, was inappropriate, and when collecting civilian firearms, some of the weapons placed in front of the statues were also taken down, causing some Buddhist believers to mistakenly doubt the authenticity of freedom of belief, causing local unrest. Although this is the situation in individual areas, the impact is not negligible. This is an inappropriate approach of starting fast and ending slow. We say that this undesirable and unpleasant situation is completely avoidable. The reason why it happened, of course, should be considered that the hidden enemies provoked to cause due vigilance, and mainly because there are indeed concerns among the lamas of the monasteries and there are indeed deviations and shortcomings in the work, which opened the door for the enemy to provoke, which is even more worthy of our warning. In the past few years since liberation, the Party has achieved victories in various tasks in pastoral areas, and the level of awareness of herdsmen has been greatly improved. Under this favorable condition, as long as we pay attention to religious issues at any time and place, the cooperativization work in ethnic minority areas can definitely be gradually done well.
    II. The funding issue of primary schools in pastoral areas: Due to the high mobility of herdsmen, the lack of fixed school buildings, and the scattered residence, students cannot go out early and return late. Boarding at school reduces the labor force at home and increases the burden on the family. Therefore, it is very difficult to run primary schools in pastoral areas. Even if they are run, it is not easy to consolidate them. If the government appropriates funds as appropriate to build fixed school buildings and provide students with food and accommodation to solve the problems of school buildings and student supply, schools will be easily held and consolidated. Developing education in ethnic minority areas is the basis of all construction undertakings in ethnic minority areas. People in various pastoral areas in Qinghai urgently request the government to solve the problem of school funding. They hope that the central government will make special arrangements to give special care.
    III. Request for further support for the development of resources in the Qaidam Basin: The Qaidam Basin in Qinghai is a treasure house of the motherland. The central government and the people of all ethnic groups across the country have given and are giving strong support. The people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai have also contributed all their strength. According to the current situation, the resources of Qaidam are rich, and the development work has a bright future. The people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai have contributed their strength with a hundredfold confidence on the premise that everything is for Qaidam. However, our existing strength cannot keep up with the needs of the development of Qaidam. Therefore, we urgently need and sincerely request the central government and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to continue to give greater support so that the development work can make greater achievements faster and let the rich treasures of Qaidam shine its light to serve the people of the whole country as soon as possible.

    在合作化高潮中要充分注意民族特点
    ——喜饶嘉错代表的发言
    我首先衷心同意和拥护李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长、彭真副委员长的报告，并为其彻底贯彻而努力。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，我们这个有悠久历史的文明古国，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，从衰弱走上了复兴的道路，中国的佛教随着祖国的兴盛而重放光明。自解放以来，各级党政切实贯彻了宗教信仰自由政策，对各宗教采取了具体的保护措施，保护了佛教的收入，培修了佛教的古迹文物，尊重和照顾了佛教徒的宗教活动、生活条件、政治地位。宪法颁布后，宗教信仰自由政策写进了宪法，在执行中日益丰富了和更好的贯彻了宗教信仰自由政策。生活在这样一个有充分的、真实的宗教信仰自由的国度里的各地区各民族各宗派的广大佛教徒，深深感到祖国的温暖，广泛地、紧密地团结在党和人民政府的周围，发挥爱国主义和普度众生的精神，正在为佛教的宏扬、为祖国的富强、为世界的和平而努力。
    现在我根据最近所接触了解的一些情况，提供几点意见，请各位代表指正。
    一、在合作化高潮中充分注意民族特点：合作化是搞好少数民族农牧业使之走上社会主义的唯一途径，固是无容争辩的真理，但由于水平有高低，走的方法是应该有不同的，其关键在于锐敏地注意少数民族的宗教问题。我们国家的宗教信仰自由政策，是令宗教人员非常满意的政策，但各地在实际执行中却不能不随时留心。藏族喇嘛有一种传统难变的不能参加耕种的佛制教规和习惯，喇嘛和寺院的田地或牛羊入社后，不可能从劳动中取得报酬，而有的固定宗教开支又专靠这些田地或牛羊的收益来解决，因此应保留其田地或牛羊股份的报酬，以解决其不安和困难，此其一。喇嘛和寺院的某些宗教活动的开支，历来有属于某一部落、或几个村、或一个村、或几户负担的旧例，在转为高级社后，这类开支有找不到负责人承担的困难，今后应有妥善的处置办法，使不致影响这类宗教活动的开支，此其二。由于一般藏民都有坚强的佛教信仰，因此每个部落或村或户在举行布施、祈祷等积福的宗教活动时，过去由集体或个人自由进行，今后属于集体进行的拟由社来负责，属于个人进行的应不予干涉，充分贯彻自由的原则，此其三。还有一些寺院和俗家藏民，由于世代习惯了私有制和个体经营，不能敏捷地认识和实行优越的集体合作制度，因此对暂时不愿入社的，应该贯彻自由选择的正确原则，不可表示急躁地要求入社，或强迫退社，并不因此对他歧视而应予以热诚的帮助，此其四。总之由于藏民对乡俗的保守性强，历来习于守旧，因此，对合作化这个为他们闻所未闻的新事物有些保守是不奇怪的，我们在这样的客观环境下推行新事物，应有高度的耐心，如果条件尚未成熟而急于求成，于公于私都非常不利的。私有观念是几千年来的旧思想，消灭起来不是一件容易的事，特别在每一新事物的开始时更应稳步前进，暂时该缓一些的就缓一些，不可追求数字，首先要努力作好宣传教育工作，做出典型，建立信仰，逐步提高，俟时机成熟，无疑会愉快地自动接受改造的，这是始慢终快的做法。如果我们在民族地区进行伟大的社会主义改造事业急于求成，对民族特点和宗教信仰上的经济条件重视得不够，以致引起有些藏民在布施等宗教活动上的不方便，形成了有些寺院喇嘛的生活和宗教活动上的困难，使有些寺院和喇嘛感到经济处于窘境，并因此顾虑到喇嘛来源逐渐会减少甚至断绝，从而引起对政府的不满，如最近四川个别藏民地区对待土地改革、寺院商业税和官钱以及田地牲畜方面处理有所不当，并在收集民间枪枝时，有的把供在神像前的武器也取了下来，致使有些佛教信徒错误地疑惑信仰自由的真实性，引起了地方不安，这虽是个别地区的情况，而影响所及是不可忽视的，这是始快终慢的不恰当的做法。我们说这种不应有的不愉快的情况是完全可以避免的，其所以发生了，当然应该考虑到暗藏敌人的挑拨引起应有的警惕，而主要由于寺院喇嘛中确实存在着顾虑和工作中确实存在着偏差缺点，致给敌人开了挑拨之门，这更是值得我们引以为戒的。解放几年以来，党在牧业区的各项工作都取得了胜利，牧民的觉悟水平已有相当提高，在这个有利条件下，只要我们随时随地留心宗教问题，民族地区的合作化工作肯定可以逐渐做好。
    二、牧业区小学的经费问题：由于牧民流动性大，缺乏固定校舍，又因居处分散，学生不能早出晚归，在校住宿，既减少了家中劳动力，又增加了家中负担，因此牧区小学很不容易办起来，就是办起来了，也不容易巩固，倘由政府从权拨款，建筑固定校舍和供给学生食宿，以解决校舍和学生供给问题，学校自易举办和巩固。发展少数民族地区的教育是少数民族地区一切建设事业的基础，青海牧区各地人民都迫切要求政府解决办校经费问题，希望中央破例予以特殊的照顾。
    三、要求进一步支援柴达木盆地资源的开发工作：青海柴达木盆地是祖国的一个宝库，中央和全国各族人民给予了和正给予大力支援，青海各族人民也贡献出了自己的全部力量。根据现在的情况看来，柴达木的资源是丰富的，开发工作是有前途的，青海各族人民在一切为了柴达木的前提下而信心百倍地贡献出了自己的力量，但我们现有的力量跟不上柴达木开发工作发展的需要，因此，我们迫切需要和诚恳要求中央和全国各族人民继续予以更大的支援，使开发工作更快地做出更大的成绩，让柴达木的丰富宝藏早日放出它为全国人民服务的光芒。
