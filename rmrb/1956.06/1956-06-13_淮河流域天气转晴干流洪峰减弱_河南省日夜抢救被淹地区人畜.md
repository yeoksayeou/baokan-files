Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 12th: From 8:00 AM on the 12th, the weather in the Huai River Basin has generally cleared up. The flood peak formed on the Huai River mainstream by the continuous heavy rains of the past ten days had passed Runheji and Zhengyangguan by the 12th and was moving eastward. Because the water inlet gate of Chengdong Lake was opened when the flood peak reached Zhengyangguan, and a large amount of floodwater was also diverted to the low-lying areas south of Zhengyangguan, this flood peak has begun to weaken.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th: The weather in parts of Henan Province gradually cleared up on the 11th. All areas along the main and tributary streams of the Huai River have organized two shifts of people to both rescue wheat and protect dikes. The steamboat sent by the Huai River Harnessing Committee to Huaibin arrived in Huaibin on the 10th to participate in the rescue work in the flooded areas. By the 9th, Huaibin County had rescued more than 21,000 people and more than 7,300 head of livestock from the flooded area; some villages in Xincai, Pingyu, and Runan were also flooded, and most of the people, livestock, and grain were rescued, and rescue efforts are continuing.

    淮河流域天气转晴干流洪峰减弱  
    河南省日夜抢救被淹地区人畜
    据新华社蚌埠12日电　从十二日早晨八时起，淮河流域普遍放晴。最近十天连续暴雨在淮河干流形成的洪峰，十二日已经越过润河集和正阳关向东前进。由于洪峰到达正阳关时开放了城东湖的进水闸，正阳关以南洼地也大量分洪，这个洪峰已经开始减弱。
    据新华社郑州12日电　河南省部分地区的天气在十一日已经逐渐转晴。沿淮河干支流各地都组织了两班人马，一面抢救麦子，一面抢护堤防。治淮委员会派往淮滨的汽轮已经在十日驶达淮滨参加被淹地区的抢救工作。淮滨县到九日，已经从水淹区内救出了二万一千多人和七千三百多头耕畜；新蔡、平舆、汝南也有些村庄被淹，人畜和粮食也都大部救出，还在继续抢救。
