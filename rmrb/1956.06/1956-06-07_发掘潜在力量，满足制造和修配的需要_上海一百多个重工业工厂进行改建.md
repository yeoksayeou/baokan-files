Unleash Latent Potential to Meet Manufacturing and Repair Needs
Over a Hundred Heavy Industrial Factories in Shanghai Undergoing Reconstruction

(Reported by this newspaper) Besides the thirty factories, including the Zhonghua Iron Factory, which are undergoing large-scale new construction and expansion (as reported on page one of this newspaper on May 29), another one hundred and thirty factories, including Shanghai Machine Factory and Shenxin Machine Factory, are currently being reconstructed on their original foundations in Shanghai.

The vast majority of these hundred-plus factories are newly established joint state-private enterprises. Their reconstruction and construction projects are mostly carried out according to the preliminary plans for the economic reorganization of their respective industries. With the development of the national construction cause, the tasks of Shanghai's heavy industry have increased. Many factories that originally only repaired machines and supplied parts now need to be organized to manufacture new complete products. The daily repair and modification tasks for existing machines in Shanghai have not decreased. Appropriately reconstructing a portion of the factories is to unleash latent potential and meet the needs of both manufacturing and repair. At the same time, a portion of the investment will be used for labor protection and quality improvement.

The joint state-private Shenxin Machine Factory was originally an affiliated factory for repairing and supplying parts for the Shenxin Textile Factory. Many precision and large machine tools were often left idle. After reconstruction, it can become an independent factory, and a group of small factories can take it as the center to specialize in the production of petroleum machinery accessories. After the Shanghai Machine Factory is reconstructed, dozens of small factories can take it as the center to expand the production of diesel engines, steam engines, and water turbines. Many factories in industries such as paint and light bulbs will also be reconstructed, with the aim of improving quality and trial-producing new products. After the Chen Shunxing Machine Factory is reconstructed on its existing foundation, it will become a larger-scale repair factory. It will not only be responsible for repairing machine tools in Shanghai, but also for repairing and modifying various metal cutting machine tools in Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places.

Currently, the reconstruction projects of these factories have already begun design or construction, and most of them will be put into production before the fourth quarter of this year.

### 发掘潜在力量，满足制造和修配的需要  上海一百多个重工业工厂进行改建

    发掘潜在力量，满足制造和修配的需要
    上海一百多个重工业工厂进行改建
    本报讯　上海市公私合营重工业工厂中，除了中华铁工厂等三十个厂要进行较大规模的新建和扩建以外（见五月二十九日本报第一版报道），上海机器厂、申新机器厂等一百三十个厂，最近正在原有基础上进行改建。
    这一百多个工厂，绝大部分是新公私合营工厂。它们的改建和修建工程，大都是根据本行业经济改组的初步计划进行的。随着国家建设事业的发展，上海重工业的任务增加了，许多原来只是修修机器、配配零件的工厂，现在要组织起来制造新的完整的产品，上海现有机器的日常修配和改装任务也没有减少。适当地改建一部分工厂，就是为了发掘潜在力量，满足制造和修配两方面的需要。同时，其中有一部分投资将用于劳动保护和提高质量。
    公私合营申新机器厂，原来只是个为申新纺织厂修配机件的附属厂，许多精密的大型机床经常搁置不用；加以改建以后，就可以成为独立厂，一批小型厂可以以它为中心，专门生产石油机械配件。上海机器厂改建以后，数十个小型厂就能以它为中心扩大柴油机、蒸汽机和水轮机的生产。造漆、灯泡等行业的许多厂，也将进行改建，目的是为了提高质量和试制新产品。陈顺兴机器厂在现有基础上改建以后，将成为一个规模较大的修理工厂；它不仅将负责修理上海的机床，而且将为无锡、苏州、杭州等地的各种金属切削机床进行修理和改装工作。
    现在，这些工厂的改建工程都已经开始设计或施工，大部分要在今年第四季度以前投入生产。
