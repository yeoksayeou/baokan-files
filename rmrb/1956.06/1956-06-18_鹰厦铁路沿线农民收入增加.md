Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th: The gradual trial opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway has opened up broad avenues for agricultural and sideline production for agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry cooperatives along the line, and the income of cooperative members has increased significantly.

In Zixi County, Jiangxi Province, on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, after the railway was opened, the county's agricultural cooperatives' pulp production has increased by 160 tons compared to the original plan; the moso bamboo, which was mostly burned as firewood in the past, has also increased by 400,000 stalks compared to the original logging plan, now that there is a market for it. It is estimated that these productions alone can increase the income of agricultural cooperatives and their members by about 435,000 yuan. According to a recent typical survey in Guangze County, Fujian Province, in the year from June of last year to the present, agricultural cooperative members who directly or indirectly participated in railway construction work and engaged in transportation and other sideline occupations earned an average of more than 250 yuan per household, and their living standards have generally improved.

    鹰厦铁路沿线农民收入增加
    据新华社福州16日电　鹰潭—厦门铁路的逐段试行通车，为沿线农、林、牧生产合作社发展农副业生产开辟了广阔门路，社员收入都显著增加。
    闽赣边境的江西省资溪县在铁路修通后，全县农业社纸浆生产已经比原计划增加了一百六十吨；过去大多当柴烧的毛竹在有了销路后，也比原订砍伐计划增加四十万根。仅这几项生产，预计可增加农业社和社员们约四十三万五千元的收入。据福建省光泽县最近的典型调查，从去年六月到现在的一年中，直接间接参加铁路修建工作，和从事运输等副业的农业社社员，平均每户所得的工资都在二百五十元以上，生活普遍有了提高。
