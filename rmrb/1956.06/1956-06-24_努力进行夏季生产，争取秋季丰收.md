These eight combine operators traveled from the far north to the hot Jianghan Plain in Hubei Province. As soon as they arrived at the 53rd Farm, they went into the combine engine room to repair the machines, and officially began harvesting wheat with the combines from May 25th. Zhang Fuyuan and Lan Yujin from the 93rd Farm, and Qu Yunfu from the Friendship Farm, were recognized by the combine operators and machine operators of the 53rd Farm as the most excellent combine operators.
