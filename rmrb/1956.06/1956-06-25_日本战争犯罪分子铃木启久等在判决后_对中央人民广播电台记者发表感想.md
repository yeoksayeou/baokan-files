Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The seventeen Japanese war criminals who were tried in Shenyang and Taiyuan expressed their feelings to a reporter from the Central People's Broadcasting Station after the Special Military Tribunal announced its verdicts.

    Former Lieutenant General Suzuki Keikichi, commander of the Japanese Army's 117th Division, began by discussing the serious crimes he committed during the war of aggression against China. He said, "When I think of how I killed so many Chinese people and made life difficult for their bereaved families, and that the people taking care of me now are relatives of the victims, my heart feels like it is being cut by a knife."
    Suzuki Keikichi said, "The investigation of the facts of the crime was very correct and fair, and was carried out using methods we had never seen or heard of in the old society." "During the trial, defense lawyers were assigned to defend me, even though there was no room for defense for our crimes, defense lawyers were still assigned. I believe this is also a manifestation of a democratic country respecting my personality and giving me equal treatment. Furthermore, the indictment was given to me a few days ago, which I think would have been impossible in the old society. In the courtroom, I was given the rights that a defendant should have in court, and treated like an ordinary person. This is also a very democratic approach. I am very grateful to China for this democratic and peaceful method. When the verdict was given, judging from my past crimes, I thought that China would severely punish me for such acts against humanity and in violation of international law, and sentence me to the death penalty. However, in the end, I was only sentenced to twenty years in prison, and the time I was detained could be deducted. Where does this lenient policy come from? I believe it comes from China's genuine policy of peace. Only with peace can mankind be happy. The path I took in the past was a path that completely destroyed human happiness. I believe that this approach should never be taken again in the world in the future." "In Japan, because we carried out the war of aggression, many Japanese people were deprived of their lives, their houses were burned down, and their lives were extremely difficult. When I think of these situations, I truly feel ashamed of my past. However, China has given me such lenient treatment, and in the future, I must become a member of defending peace, join the peace camp, and work hard for the rest of my life."
    After being sentenced to twenty years in prison in Taiyuan, Jun'ichiro Tominaga told reporters, "I sincerely thank the Chinese people for giving me such lenient treatment, because the heinous crimes I committed should have been punishable by death. I am deeply grateful for the humanitarian policy adopted by the government of the People's Republic of China. I am also willing to keep this feeling of gratitude firmly in my heart, sincerely and earnestly obey the court's judgment, and take another step forward in self-reform, striving to allow myself to return to the people as soon as possible, in order to compensate for the serious crimes I have committed. The last clause of the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on the handling of war criminals points out the lenient policy of granting early release to those who perform well during their sentence. I am determined to work hard and strive to obtain this lenient treatment.
    "The ancients often said: 'If you have faults, do not hesitate to correct them.' I was indeed wrong. Today I am very happy to have this opportunity to repent. And I apologize to the Chinese people who have suffered great disasters and pain. I don't think there is anything more pleasant than a person being able to become a good person. I will take the first step in my life from today, and I will be a good person for the rest of my life. I thank everyone. My heart is now full of joy."
    Hirono Shiroyama, who was sentenced to eighteen years in prison in Taiyuan, told reporters, "I feel extremely grateful to the Chinese people. According to my crimes, I have indeed committed crimes that are not enough to compensate for even with several lives.
    "However, the Chinese people have educated me in the past and clearly told me what is right. And today, I have received truly lenient treatment.
    "I am very grateful. I believe that the day of my sentencing is a new starting point for me from now on. I feel that from now on my life is given by the Chinese people. I think I should truly reflect on how wrong my past behavior was. I participated in this war of aggression, and also participated in the counter-revolutionary war in China. The crimes I committed caused disaster to the Chinese people. I am truly sorry to the Chinese people. In the future, I will live a life of repentance and atonement.
    "In order to do this, I must truly fight for the peace that the people desire. I must use my own experience to see clearly the tragedy of this war, learn from this lesson, look forward to the future, oppose war, and fight for peace."
    Shiroyama Hirono finally talked about his family. He said, "Regarding my family, I have been allowed in the past to communicate with my family several times, and I think my family also understands our situation. They also know about the treatment the Chinese people have given me."
    He said, "Just as the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress said, I will work hard in the future and can strive to shorten my sentence. I will work hard to do it.
    "Therefore, my family can also rest assured. I hope my family will recognize the cruelty of war and the harm of war to the people from the war crimes I committed in the past eleven years, and fight for peace and oppose war. I hope my wife and children must also work hard for peace. Also, I have nothing else to tell my family."
    Tsutomu Nagashima, former Major General of the 54th Brigade of the 59th Division of the Japanese Army and Commander of the Jinan Defense Command, talked about the crimes he committed in China and his life while being detained. He said, "China still respects the human rights of a major criminal like me, and the problems of clothing, food, housing, and other aspects of life have been guaranteed. Up to now, I have lived very comfortably. Generally, I read in the morning, exercise in the afternoon, and in the evening, I have entertainment or free time. This time we came to be tried by the Special Military Tribunal, and this trial was very democratic." He said, "Through this trial, my determination to resolutely oppose the war of aggression and strive for peace has been greatly strengthened. Although I committed serious crimes, I was only sentenced to sixteen years in prison, and one day of past detention will count as one day."
    Nagashima Tsutomu said, "I was very surprised after I learned about this. How fair and humane China's judgment is! It moved me very much. According to the regulations for handling our Japanese war criminals, we can be released early depending on our own efforts during our sentence in the future. I am prepared to work hard and strive to receive this grace. Based on the above situation, through this Chinese handling, as I said just now, I feel even more that we must never engage in a war of aggression in the future, we must resolutely oppose and prevent this war, and we want peace. I hope that my family members can also consider this point well and resolutely live a peaceful life with everyone."
    Hideo Sakakibara, former Major and Commander of the 162nd Detachment of Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who was sentenced to thirteen years in prison for engaging in the preparation of germ warfare activities, told reporters, "As a doctor in the past, I should have been responsible for serving the health and happiness of the people, but I went down the path of the crimes and destruction of imperialism for my own immediate interests, and finally became one of the people in charge of the germ warfare organized by Japanese imperialism, and committed serious crimes of abusing medicine and attempting to massacre a large number of human beings. My crimes trampled on the sacred international law recognized by the people of the world and completely violated the principles of humanitarianism, so my crimes are very serious. I feel very ashamed when I reflect on my past crimes. I would like to express my deep apologies to the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the peace-loving people of the world."
    Hideo Sakakibara said, "For the Japanese people, I was also an imperialist who gave them great misfortune in the past, so I want to apologize to the Japanese people. From my past painful experience of crimes, I personally feel the sinfulness and inhumanity of weapons of mass destruction such as bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and atomic weapons. Therefore, I resolutely oppose the imperialist war of aggression with a hateful heart, and oppose the use of weapons of mass destruction that are not tolerated by humanity."
    Hideo Sakakibara finally told reporters that he hoped his children "will not be afraid of difficulties, help their mother with housework, and study hard to become people who can contribute to world peace." Yoshikazu Sumioka told reporters: "Just now the presiding judge sentenced me to eleven years in prison, and these eleven years will also be offset by the years I have been detained. Judging from the crimes of aggression and counter-revolution that I have committed, I was originally a mortal enemy of the Chinese people, but I have received such lenient treatment." Yoshikazu Sumioka said: "In the next three years, I will work hard to repay China for its leniency towards me. Now I will say a few words to my family: Mother, please rest assured, in the next three years, I will definitely work hard, and I will return to my country when I am pardoned by the Chinese people. Please take care of yourself. During my sentence, the Chinese people gave me humane treatment. This is as I said in the letter I wrote to you this spring. Encouraged by the warm intentions of the Chinese people, I am working hard, please rest assured. Yes, I am determined to work hard in these three years to strive to be pardoned by the Chinese people."
    Shintaro Uno talked about his trial and hoped that the reporter could convey it to his mother in Japan. He also said: "Judging from the crimes I have committed, I should have been dead. In addition, I also committed the crime of killing many Chinese farmers. The Chinese people are so lenient to me, I sincerely feel that my future is full of hope. The Japanese people suffered great disasters in the past wrong war, and I don't know how to apologize to them. My mother suffered a lot to raise me, but I committed such an unfilial crime. I don't know what to say to her. Please forgive me. I oppose war, and I can no longer allow a war of aggression against China to dominate the world. Mother! Please take care of yourself. The Chinese people saved me, so don't worry about anything. It may be possible to be released early depending on how hard I work in the future. I must become a good person who opposes war and defends peace. When I go back, my mother and the Japanese people may happily welcome me. Please take care and say hello to everyone."
    Minoru Kasai was sentenced to eleven years in prison in Taiyuan. He told reporters that he really did not know what to say to apologize and thank for the leniency of the Chinese government. He said: "I really feel strongly that only in a people's country like China can people like me be helped. In the future, during my sentence, I must earnestly serve my sentence, and in the future, I must be a new person, and be sure not to commit such brutal crimes again. Today, Japan is fabricating some unfounded incidents and clamoring against the Soviet Union and communism, and I have committed crimes because of this kind of groundless slander. Reflecting on my own crimes, I think this conspiracy must be crushed, and we must defend peace. If I can be released and return home in my lifetime, I will dedicate myself to the cause of peace. I sincerely thank the Chinese people. Please be sure to convey this feeling to the Chinese people, and also convey it to the Japanese people, so that the Japanese people know that I have received very lenient treatment."
    The other nine Japanese war criminals who were sentenced also told reporters from the Central People's Broadcasting Station their feelings.

    日本战争犯罪分子铃木启久等在判决后
    对中央人民广播电台记者发表感想
    新华社23日讯　在沈阳、太原两地受审判的十七名日本战争犯罪分子在特别军事法庭宣布判决以后，对中央人民广播电台记者谈了他们的感想。
    前日本陆军第一一七师团中将师团长铃木启久一开头就谈到他在侵略中国的战争中所犯的严重罪行。他说：“当我想到我曾经杀害很多的中国人民，使他们的遗属的生活遭到困难，而目前照顾我的人正是被害者的亲人，这时候我的心有如刀割一般。”
    铃木启久说：“在调查犯罪事实的时候，是非常正确而公正的，完全是用了我们在旧社会未曾见闻过的方法进行调查的。”“在进行审判时，还派辩护人为我进行辩护，尽管我们的罪恶没有什么辩护的余地，仍然派了辩护人来。我认为，这也是尊重我的人格，给予平等待遇的民主国家的表现。并且在几天以前就把起诉书交给了我，我觉得，这在旧社会也是不可能有的事情。在法庭上，给我以一个被告在法庭应有的权利，和一个普通的人一样，这也是非常民主的方式。我对中国这种民主的和平的方法，非常感激。在进行判决时，我按照我过去的罪行来判断，认为中国对我这样悖逆人道，违反国际公法的作法，当然要从严处断，处以极刑。但是，结果，我只被判处二十年徒刑，而且可以用被关押的时间折抵。这种宽大政策是从哪里产生出来的呢？我认为，这是由中国的真正的和平政策产生出来的。只有和平，人类才能幸福。我过去走过道路完全是破坏人类幸福的道路，我认为，将来绝对不应该再对世界采取这种方式。”“在日本，因为我们进行了侵略战争，日本人民有很多人被夺去了生命，家屋被烧毁，生活极为困苦。当我想到这些情况的时候，我对我的过去的确感到惭愧。但是，中国对我竟然作了这样宽大的处理，今后我一定要成为保卫和平的一分子，参加到和平阵营，以我的余生进行努力。”
    富永顺太郎在太原被判处二十年徒刑以后对记者说：“我衷心感谢中国人民对我作了这样宽大的处理。因为我所犯的滔天罪行本来是应当判处死刑的。我深深地感谢中华人民共和国政府所采取的人道主义的政策。我并且愿意把这个感谢和感激的心情牢记在心里，诚心诚意地认真地服从法律的判决，在自我改造中再提高一步，努力让自己能早日走到人民中去，以补偿我所犯的严重罪行。中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于处理战犯的决定中最后一条，指出了在服刑期间表现良好者将予提前释放的宽大政策。我要决心努力，要争取得到这一宽大处理。
    “古人也常说：‘过则勿惮改’。我的确是错了。今天我得到这个机会能够悔过，我感到非常高兴。并且向受到很大灾难和痛苦的中国人民道歉。我觉得再没有比一个人能变成好人更愉快的了。我要从今天起踏上人生的第一步，我这后半辈子要作一个好人。我感谢大家。现在我心里充满了愉快。”
    被判处十八年徒刑的城野宏在太原对记者说：“我觉得，我万分感谢中国人民。按我的罪恶来说，我的确是犯了再有几条命也不足以抵偿的罪行。
    “但是，中国人民以往对我进行了教育，明确地告诉我什么是正确的。而且在今天，我得到真正的宽大处理。
    “我非常感谢。我认为，对我宣判的这一天，是我从今以后的一个新起点。我觉得从今以后我的生命是中国人民赐给的。我想到，我要真正反省自己过去的行为是多么错误的。我参加了这个侵略战争，还参加了中国的反革命战争，我所犯的罪行给中国人民造成了灾害。我真是对不起中国人民。今后我要过悔过和赎罪的生活。
    “为要这样做，我一定要真正为人民所希望的和平而斗争。我一定要根据自己的体验，看清楚这个战争的悲惨，吸取这个教训，瞻望前途，反对战争，为和平而进行斗争。”
    城野宏最后谈到他的家庭，他说：“对家里，我自己以往曾得到允许，同家里通过几次信，我觉得，家里也很了解我们的情况。中国人民给我这样的待遇的情况也是知道的。”
    他说：“就像人民代表大会常务委员会的决定所说，我自己今后努力，可以争取缩短刑期，我要努力去做。
    “所以，家属也可以放心，我希望家属从我在十一年里所犯的战争罪行中，认识到战争的残酷，以及战争对人民的危害，为争取和平、反对战争而进行斗争。我希望我的妻子和孩子，也一定要为争取和平而努力。另外，我没有什么要告诉家里的话了。”
    前日本陆军第五九师团第五四旅团少将旅团长兼济南防卫司令官长岛勤谈到了他在中国所犯的罪行和他在被关押期间的生活情形。他说：“中国对我这样的大罪人，还是尊重我的人权，衣食住和其他生活上的问题得到了保证，截至现在为止，我生活得都很舒适。大体上是上午阅读，下午作运动，晚上是娱乐或自由活动的时间。这次我们来受特别军事法庭的审判，这个审判是非常民主的。”他说：“通过这次审判，大大地加强了我坚决反对侵略战争和争取和平的思想。我虽然犯了严重的罪行，却只判了我十六年徒刑，并且过去关押期间有一天就要算一天的数。”
    长岛勤说：“我知道了这件事以后很是惊讶。中国的判决是如何公正而且人道！使我非常感动。按照处理我们日本战犯的规定，今后在服刑期间看我们自己的努力情况，还可以提前释放。我准备大大地努力一番，争取能够受到这种恩典。根据以上这种情况，通过这次中国的处理，像我刚才所说，我更加感到将来万不可再搞侵略战争，我们必须坚决反对并阻止这种战争，我们要和平。我希望家属们也能很好地考虑到这点，坚决地和大家一道过和平的生活。”
    因从事准备细菌战活动而被判处十三年徒刑的前日本关东军第七三一部队第一六二支队少佐支队长榊原秀夫对记者说：“我过去作为一个医生，本来应当是负着为人民的健康和幸福而服务的使命的，可是我竟为了自己眼前的利益，走上了帝国主义的罪恶和毁灭的道路，最后终至成为日本帝国主义组织细菌战的负责人之一，犯下了滥用医学，企图大量屠杀人类的严重罪行。我的罪行蹂躏了全世界人民所公认的神圣的国际公法，完全违反了人道主义的原则，因此我的罪行是非常严重的。我反省过去的罪行，感到非常惭愧。我愿在中国人民、日本人民和全世界爱好和平的人民面前深致歉意。”
    榊原秀夫说：“对日本人民来说，我过去也是作为一个帝国主义者给了他们以很大不幸的人，因此我要向日本人民道歉。从我过去惨痛的罪恶的经验中，我切身感到细菌武器、化学武器、原子武器等大量杀人武器的罪恶性和它的不人道。因此我以憎恨的心情坚决反对帝国主义的侵略战争，反对使用为人道所不容许的大量杀人武器。”
    榊原秀夫最后对记者说，他希望他的孩子“要不畏艰难，帮助母亲作事情，并认真地学习，成为一个能对世界和平作出贡献的人。”住冈义一对记者说：“刚才审判长判处我十一年徒刑，并且这十一年还要和我被关押的年数折算。从我所犯的侵略罪行和反革命的罪行来看，我本是中国人民的死敌，可是我竟受到这样宽大的处理。”住冈义一说：“在未来的三年里，我将认真地工作，以报答中国对我的宽大。现在我对我的家属说几句话：母亲，请您放心吧，在今后的三年里，我一定认真地工作，将来得到中国人民的赦免，我就要回国了。请您多加保重。在服刑期间，中国人民给我以人道的待遇。这就像我今年春天给您写信所说的那样。在中国人民这样温暖的心意鼓舞之下，我正在努力地工作着，请您放心。是的，我决心要在这三年里认真地工作以争取得到中国人民的赦免。”
    鹈野晋太郎谈了他受审判的情形，他希望记者能转告他在日本的母亲。他又说：“从我所犯的罪来看，我本来是活不了的。加之我还犯了杀害许多中国农民的罪行。中国人民对我这样宽大，我衷心感到我的前途充满了希望。日本人民在过去错误的战争中受到很大灾难，我不知道怎样对他们道歉才好。母亲受了很多苦把我养大，而我竟犯了这样不孝的罪，我不知道对他说些什么才好，请您饶恕我吧，我反对战争，我再不能容许发动侵略中国称霸世界的战争了。母亲！请您多加保重，中国人民拯救了我，您什么也不要惦记了。今后看我努力如何，也可能提前释放。我一定要成为一个反对战争保卫和平的好人，等我回去的时候，母亲和日本人民都有可能愉快地来迎接我。请您保重并问大家安好。”
    笠实在太原被判处十一年徒刑，他对记者说，对于中国政府的宽大，“我真不知道用什么话来道歉和感谢才好”。他说：“我真的强烈地感到只有在中国这样人民的国家里，像我这样的人才能够得到帮助。今后在服刑期间，我一定要认真地服刑，今后我一定要重新作人，务期不再犯这样残暴的罪行。今天日本又在捏造一些毫无根据的事端，叫嚷反苏反共，而我又正是因为这种无中生有的诬蔑而犯了罪的，反省一下自己的罪行，我认为必须把这种阴谋予以粉碎，我们一定要保卫和平。如果在我有生之年，将来能够获释返国，我一定要献身于和平事业。我由衷地感谢中国人民。希望务必把我这种心情转告给中国人民，并转告日本人民，使日本人民知道我已受到非常宽大的处理。”
    其他九名被判刑的日本战争犯罪分子，也都对中央人民广播电台记者谈了他们的感想。
