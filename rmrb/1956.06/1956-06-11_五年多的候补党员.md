A Probationary Party Member for Over Five Years

Yang Pu, a probationary party member of the Jilin City Cultural Bureau branch, joined the Party in 1950 with a probationary period of one year. However, he has not been formally admitted to this day. When the Cultural Bureau branch first discussed his formal admission, they felt that they did not have a clear enough understanding of his social connections and needed to continue investigating, so they decided to extend the probationary period. During the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952, this probationary party member applied for formal admission again. At that time, the branch and the Jilin City Directly Subordinate Party Committee's Cultural and Educational General Branch agreed to Yang Pu's formal admission, but someone raised that Yang Pu's performance in the Three-Anti movement was only average and that he had engaged in sheltering embezzlers. The so-called sheltering embezzlers was actually a baseless suspicion. The Cultural and Educational General Branch believed that since "social connections are not easy to clarify for the time being and need to be investigated slowly" and "ideological awareness is not high and needs further education," it disagreed with his formal admission. After this, the Cultural Bureau branch and the Cultural and Educational General Branch neither actively educated Yang Pu to improve his class consciousness, nor seriously investigated his social connections. As time went on, the branch committee was re-elected. The new branch committee emphasized that they did not understand the situation of this probationary party member very well and needed to "further understand and educate" him. In the same way, the new branch committee neither understood nor educated him. In this way, Yang Pu became an "old probationary party member" who had not been formally admitted for more than five years.

We are very worried about this probationary party member. If the Party organization of the Cultural Bureau continues to adopt this attitude towards this issue, this probationary party member may never be formally admitted.

    五年多的候补党员
    吉林市文化局支部的候补党员杨璞是1950年入党的，候补期是一年。可是，直到现在他还没有转正。文化局支部第一次讨论他的转正问题的时候，感到对他的社会关系了解得不够清楚，需要继续了解，因此决定延长候补期。1952年“三反”运动期间，这个候补党员又申请转正。当时支部和吉林市直属党委文教总支同意杨璞转正，但有人又提出杨璞在三反运动中表现得一般，并且有包庇贪污分子的行为。所谓包庇贪污分子，实际上是一种毫无根据的怀疑。文教总支认为既然“社会关系一时不易搞清，需要慢慢的调查”，“觉悟不高也需要进一步教育”，就不同意转正了。这以后，文化局支部和文教总支既没有对杨璞积极进行教育，以提高他的阶级觉悟，也没有认真地调查他的社会关系。时间拖久了，支部委员会改选了。新的支委会强调对这个候补党员的情况不太了解，需要再“进一步了解和教育”。同样的，新支委会也是既没有了解又没有教育。就这样，杨璞成了五年多没有转正的“老候补党员”。
    我们很为这个候补党员担心，如果文化局的党组织对这个问题继续采取这种态度，这个候补党员恐怕就永无转正之日了。
