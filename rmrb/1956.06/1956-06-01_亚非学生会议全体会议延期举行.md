Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, 31st – Aminuddin, Chairman of the International Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Student Conference, announced this afternoon that the plenary session of the Asian-African Student Conference would be postponed.
	The plenary session was originally scheduled to be held this morning, but due to the fact that no decision was made on the issue of reviewing the credentials of the delegations at the heads of delegations meeting, it was later decided to postpone it to 5:00 p.m. today. However, the plenary session failed to be held in the afternoon, so Aminuddin announced another postponement.

    亚非学生会议全体会议延期举行
    新华社万隆31日电　亚非学生会议国际筹备委员会主席阿米努丁今天下午宣布，亚非学生会议全体会议延期举行。
    全体会议原定在今天上午举行，由于在学生代表团团长会议上，对于审查代表团证书问题没有作出决定，后来决定延期到今天下午五时举行。但是到了下午，全体会议又未能举行，因此阿米努丁宣布再度延期。
