Xinhua News Agency, June 16th. The Beijing Education Bureau today invited over two hundred returned overseas students and family members of overseas students who have not yet returned to hold a symposium at Zhongshan Park.

At the symposium, Wu Han, Vice Mayor of Beijing, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, expressed his welcome and congratulations to the returned overseas students, and his cordial regards to the families of the overseas students. Wu Han said that the nearly ten thousand Chinese scientists and students working and studying in countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and Japan are a very valuable asset to the motherland. Overseas students returning to the embrace of the motherland to serve the people, becoming useful talents for building the motherland, will be warmly welcomed and respected by the people of the motherland. He hoped that the returned overseas students and family members of overseas students present would communicate more with their friends and relatives, and help them return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.

Lin Yi, who just returned from the United States this year with a doctoral degree, Liao Shantao, also with a doctoral degree, and Yang Zhexian, a family member of an overseas student, all spoke at the meeting. Yang Zhexian protested at the meeting against the various刁难 [unnecessary difficulties] and threatening measures taken by the US government against Chinese students. She said that her husband, Cao Bainian, a student in the United States, was unable to return home to reunite with his family under these circumstances. Dr. Lin Yi, who researches organic chemistry, returned to China at the end of January this year and is now conducting research on polymer chemistry at the Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
