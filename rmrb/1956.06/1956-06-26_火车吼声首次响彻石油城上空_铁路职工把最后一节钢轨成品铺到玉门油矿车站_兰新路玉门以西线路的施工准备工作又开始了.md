    The Roar of the Train Resounds Over the Oil City for the First Time
    Railway Workers Lay the Last Section of Finished Steel Rail to the Yumen Oil Mine Station
    Construction Preparations for the Section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway West of Yumen Begin Again
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Yumen, June 25th) At around 11 o'clock on the night of the 24th, a deafening train whistle resounded for the first time over the ever-lit Oil City – heroic railway workers, driving a massive rail-laying machine, completed laying the final section of finished steel rail at the Yumen City South Station (Yumen Oil Mine Station). With this, the pledge made by the workers constructing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to reach Yumen by July 1st has been fulfilled ahead of schedule. Currently, construction of crude oil loading facilities and material warehouses is being accelerated along the railway line. The track-laying project for the Yumen Oil Mine Station's sidings and dedicated lines is about to begin. Soon, trains will be used to directly transport crude oil from the oil mining area.
    The Yumen Oil Mine is located on the desolate Gobi Desert outside Jiayuguan. As early as 1936, Sun Jianchu, a famous Chinese geologist, discovered the Laojunmiao oil-bearing structure here. Since then, drilling and oil extraction have gradually formed an oil mining area. Since liberation, thanks to the Party and the government's policy of vigorously developing the petroleum industry, the construction scale of this oil city has expanded day by day. Now, it has become a comprehensive enterprise including eighteen work units such as geology, drilling, oil extraction, and refining. The total number of employees has increased sevenfold compared to before liberation, and the total output value of the mine has increased more than fivefold. It has played and will continue to play the role of a petroleum base: in addition to producing more and better oil every year to meet the needs of the country and the people, it has also trained many workers and cadres with considerable technical skills and business capabilities, summarized complete sets of advanced experiences, and supported the development needs of new fraternal oil factories and mines.
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Lanzhou, June 25th) Construction preparations for the section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway west of Yumen have begun.
    The advance team, composed of tens of thousands of railway workers, has already entered the new construction site. Along the more than 200-kilometer line from Yumen East Station in the east to Hongliuyuan in the west, trucks are busily transporting materials. The houses and cotton tents needed for construction are being erected one after another on the Gobi Desert. Several temporary roads for transporting equipment are also being rushed to completion.
    The section of the line west of Yumen traverses the sparsely populated Gobi Desert, with complex geology, strong winds and sand, and a shortage of water and firewood along the way. In order to rapidly extend the railway westward, the road-building workers have been actively finding ways to overcome many construction obstacles.
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Urumqi) The subgrade engineering for the section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway within Xinjiang, east of Hami, will begin ahead of schedule.
    The Party and government leading organs of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have decided to mobilize more than 10,000 migrant workers from all parts of Xinjiang to participate in the construction of the subgrade, and to transfer more than 100 cadres from the prefectural and county-level organs to lead the migrant workers. In early July, a portion of the workers will go to the construction site to carry out preparatory work; in August, the subgrade engineering can begin in full swing. The Autonomous Region People's Committee has also decided to allocate vehicles to transport drinking water to the migrant workers at the construction site. The Grain Bureau, the Commerce Bureau, the Coal Mine Management Bureau and other departments will also do everything possible to support the road construction project.

    火车吼声首次响彻石油城上空
    铁路职工把最后一节钢轨成品铺到玉门油矿车站
    兰新路玉门以西线路的施工准备工作又开始了
    本报玉门25日电　在二十四日夜十一时许，一声震天巨响的火车吼鸣，第一次响彻了不夜的石油城的上空——英雄的铁路职工，驾御着巨大的铺轨机，在玉门市南站（玉门油矿车站）铺完了最后一节钢轨成品。至此，修筑兰新铁路职工提出的“七一”修到玉门的保证已经提前实现了。目前，铁路线上正在加紧修筑原油装车设备和材料库。玉门油矿车站股道和专用线的铺轨工程，马上就要开始。不久，就将利用火车直接从油矿区运出原油。
    玉门油矿在嘉峪关外荒无人烟的戈壁滩上，远在1936年，我国有名的地质学家孙健初在这里发现了老君庙储油构造后，从此钻探、采油，逐渐形成了一个油矿区。解放以来，由于党和政府采取大力发展石油工业的政策，这座石油城的建设规模日益扩大。现在，它已成为一个包括地质、钻井、采油、炼油等十八个工作单位综合性的企业。职工总数较解放前增加了七倍，全矿生产总值增加五倍多。它已经起着并将继续起着石油基地的作用：除每年生产了更多更好的石油，满足国家和人民的需要外，还培养了许多具有相当技术水平和业务能力的工人与干部，总结了成套的先进经验，支援了新的兄弟石油厂矿发展的需要。
    本报兰州25日电　兰新铁路玉门以西线路的施工准备工作已经开始。
    上万名铁路工人组成的先头部队，已经进入新工地。在东起玉门东站西至红柳园的二百多公里沿线，汽车正在繁忙地运输材料；施工中需要的房屋和棉帐篷，正在戈壁滩上陆续搭设起来；几条运送器材的公路便线，也在加紧修筑。
    玉门以西的一段线路，横跨在人烟稀少的戈壁滩上，地质复杂，风沙很大，沿途缺水、缺柴。为了使铁路迅速向西伸展，筑路职工已经积极设法克服了许多施工的障碍。
    本报乌鲁木齐讯　兰新铁路新疆境内哈密以东的路基工程将提前动工。
    新疆维吾尔自治区党政领导机关决定从全疆各地动员一万多民工参加修筑路基，从各专区、县级机关中抽调一百多名干部带领民工。七月初，一部分职工将到工地进行准备工作；八月份，路基工程可以全部动工。自治区人民委员会还决定调拨车辆，给工地的民工运送饮水。粮食厅、商业厅、煤矿管理局等部门，也将尽一切力量支援筑路工程。
