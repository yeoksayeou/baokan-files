Title: The Printing Units of Various Agencies Should Be Managed Uniformly

To the Editor:

    Currently, many agencies have their own printing units. The central government agencies alone have dozens of directly affiliated printing factories (or units), some with only three or four people, and some with six or seven hundred. The common characteristic of these units is that their tasks are not fixed. When there are no tasks, they are extremely idle and look for things to do everywhere. When there are tasks, they are extremely busy, and the phenomenon of working overtime is very serious. Some larger printing factories, in order to balance production, solicit work from outside. However, the tasks of the agency may come down at any time, and the solicited work cannot be returned, often resulting in a dilemma. As for small printing units, they have even more difficulties because of poor equipment and a small workforce.

    Agency printing units are generally led by administrative departments, whose only requirement for the printing units is to complete the printing tasks of the agency, and they rarely inquire about business and management work. This makes the management level of these printing units very backward, the productivity is not high, and the waste is very serious.

    Based on the above situation, I think it would be very beneficial to merge some agency printing units and manage them uniformly. This would not only make full use of equipment utilization and complete agency printing tasks better and faster, but also improve work efficiency, improve business management, and save national expenditures. I hope that the relevant leading departments will study this opinion.

### 应该统一管理各机关的印刷单位

    应该统一管理各机关的印刷单位编辑同志：
    目前，很多机关都有自己的印刷单位，仅中央机关的直属印刷厂（所）就有好几十处，其中小的只三、四个人，大的有六、七百人。这些单位的共同特点是：任务不固定，没有任务就闲得发慌，到处找事情做，一有任务就忙得要死，加班加点的现象很严重。有些较大的印刷厂为了平衡生产，就向外面招揽工作：但是本机关的任务说不定什么时候下来了，揽来的活又不能退，结果常常是左右为难。至于小型印刷所，因为设备差，人手少，困难更多。
    机关印刷单位一般是由行政部门领导，他们对于印刷单位的要求只是完成本机关的印刷任务，对业务和管理工作很少过问。这就使得这些印刷单位的管理水平很落后，生产率不高，浪费现象也很严重。
    根据以上情况，我觉得，把一些机关的印刷所合并起来，统一管理，是有很多好处的。这样不但可以充分发挥设备的利用率，更好、更快地完成机关印刷任务；而且可以提高工作效率，改善经营管理，节省国家的开支。希望有关领导部门研究这个意见。
