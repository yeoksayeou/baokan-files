Agricultural Cooperatives Should Organize Manpower to Support Industrial Construction
Zhen Lingde

Along with the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production in our country, the production and construction tasks of industry and transportation have greatly increased. The labor demand of industry and transportation has also increased. This year, in addition to transferring temporary workers from cities, industrial and transportation construction projects must also recruit hundreds of thousands of people from rural areas. Actively organizing manpower to support industrial construction and fully meeting the needs of industrial construction for labor is the unshirkable responsibility of agricultural production cooperatives.

Due to the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the broad masses of peasants have joined the cooperatives. The phenomenon of peasants spontaneously flowing into cities to find work has basically disappeared, and the phenomenon of some workers from cities with rural homes flowing back to the countryside has occurred. This has led to a tight labor supply situation since this spring. According to many construction companies, it has been very difficult to recruit workers from rural areas this year, and they often cannot complete their tasks. The Third Engineering Office of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways planned to recruit 1,500 laborers in Hebei Province in early February, but after a month, only 75% of the original plan was completed. Some construction projects are often delayed due to a lack of labor, or have to stop work and wait due to imbalances in labor supply. In addition, consolidating the work of workers recruited from rural areas is also difficult. For example, the number of workers who returned to the countryside this spring from the Dongye First Company in Chengde City accounted for 30% of the total number of workers. This phenomenon of returning home is becoming increasingly serious with the arrival of the wheat harvest season.

Why are there phenomena of not being able to recruit workers and temporary workers wanting to return home? Is it because the rural labor force is insufficient to meet the needs of agricultural production, and it is impossible to draw out part of the manpower to support industrial construction? No, it is not. Generally speaking, after agricultural cooperativization, although the manpower used in agricultural production and rural infrastructure construction has greatly increased, due to the unprecedented increase in the production enthusiasm of agricultural cooperative members, not only will the production attendance rate greatly improve, but also a large number of women will be mobilized to participate in agricultural production, adding a large number of labor to the countryside. Therefore, according to the current situation, if sideline production is not developed on a large scale, rural labor is surplus, except for a few sparsely populated areas. According to the preliminary planning materials of the labor force of six agricultural cooperatives in Tong County, Xianghe County, and Shunyi County, an average of 26% of the labor force is surplus after deducting the labor force required for agriculture. This shows that there is currently manpower in rural areas to support industrial construction.

The main reasons why workers cannot be recruited in rural areas and temporary workers want to return to the countryside are: First, some rural staff lack a sufficient understanding of the great significance of national industrial construction. They emphasize that the task of increasing agricultural production is heavy and that there is a shortage of labor, and openly refuse to transfer labor to support industrial construction. Some agricultural cooperatives have a surplus of labor and are willing to export some labor, but they are also blocked and sent back by some district and township staff. Some county staff, after receiving recruitment tasks, say: Are you asking us to engage in industry or agriculture? Some agricultural cooperative staff do not allow members to go out to work, and even if they do, they write letters to call them back. In general, when agricultural cooperatives make labor plans, they do not include the labor force needed to support industrial construction. After peasants join agricultural cooperatives, they carry out organized and planned production under the leadership of the cooperatives, and they cannot go out to work as they pleased in the past.

Second, the labor remuneration of general agricultural cooperatives is set too high, and the wages of laborers in industrial infrastructure construction are too disparate. General cooperative members feel that they earn less money going out to work and that participating in agricultural production brings more income, so they are unwilling to go out to work. Some agricultural cooperatives stipulate that all wages earned by members who go out to work, except for their own food expenses, must be handed over to the cooperative, which records work points, and profits are distributed uniformly within the cooperative after the autumn harvest. This method not only lacks an incentive effect for members to go out to work, but is also detrimental to improving labor productivity at construction sites. Some agricultural cooperatives stipulate that members who go out to work must pay one yuan or one yuan and five jiao per day, and the cooperative will record one work point for them. This method forces some workers to slip away when they cannot reach the labor quota and their wages are not enough to hand over to the cooperative.

Third, construction units use people without a plan, grabbing them whenever they need them, making it impossible for labor allocation departments to prepare in advance, making it impossible for agricultural cooperatives to use manpower rationally, and thus creating difficulties in completing recruitment tasks on schedule. Some construction units do not provide enough management, education, and care for temporary workers, which also affects the enthusiasm of peasants to support industrial construction.

In order to ensure that the labor force needed for industrial construction is fully supplied, propaganda work to support industrial construction should be carried out in rural areas to make rural staff and members of agricultural cooperatives understand the great significance of the worker-peasant alliance in socialist construction and realize that peasants should not only do a good job in agricultural production and produce more grain to support industrial construction, but also actively organize manpower to participate in industrial construction. Organizing manpower to participate in industrial construction is the glorious task of every agricultural cooperative. Agricultural cooperatives should not only not hinder members who are willing to go out to participate in construction, but also organize and mobilize better members to participate in industrial construction. Organizing a part of the members to participate in industrial construction can not only promote the rational use of labor within the cooperative, avoid idle work and waste, but also enable the cooperative to obtain a certain amount of labor remuneration and increase the cooperative's capital income. It is hoped that rural staff will actively lead agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in labor production planning and include the labor force needed to support industrial construction in the plan. This requires a reasonable arrangement of the labor force through detailed accounting methods, saving and using it, and fully exploiting the potential of rural labor so that the labor force needed for both agriculture and industry is not delayed. And it is necessary to specifically assist construction companies in completing recruitment tasks.

Regarding the issue of how to handle the wage income of members who go out to work, it should generally be resolved in accordance with the principle of encouraging members to actively participate in industrial construction. The wages earned by members who participate in industrial construction should be fully controlled by themselves, except for the public welfare fund and the public accumulation fund contributed according to the regulations of the cooperative's charter. Alternatively, the wages earned by members who participate in industrial construction (calculated according to the daily standard wage) should be handed over to the agricultural cooperative, except for the extraction of certain living allowances. The cooperative will record work points of equal labor for him according to his actual attendance days at the construction site, and after the autumn harvest, profits will be distributed and remuneration will be taken in the cooperative. Wages earned exceeding the labor quota and bonuses earned for inventions and creations should be controlled by oneself; or a small portion should be handed over to the cooperative in a certain proportion. The issue of how to handle the wage income of members who go out to work is a very complicated issue. It is hoped that rural staff comrades can introduce some more mature experiences.

On the construction company side, attention should be paid to the wage and welfare benefits and political and ideological education of temporary workers. In addition to appropriately raising the wage standards of temporary workers, the piece-rate wage and over-quota reward system should be vigorously promoted to stimulate the production enthusiasm and creativity of workers and enable them to get more pay for more work. Construction companies should also actively take measures to enable workers to reach the quota and exceed the labor quota, try to improve the various equipment conditions such as diet and accommodation for temporary workers, and care about their living difficulties. The Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations of enterprises should always pay attention to the ideological education of workers to improve their socialist consciousness, consolidate their production enthusiasm, and improve their labor productivity.

I believe that as long as the county, district, and township Party committees and people's committees pay a little attention, and as long as rural work comrades make a little effort, it will not be a problem to mobilize agricultural production cooperatives to organize manpower to support industrial construction. The important issue is that labor allocation agencies at all levels must thoroughly find out how much labor construction companies need, grasp the source of labor, accurately formulate labor allocation plans, and properly complete recruitment tasks.

    农业合作社要组织人力支援工业建设
    甄令德
    在我国农业合作化和农业生产迅速发展的同时，工业和交通运输业的生产和建设任务大大加重了。工业和交通运输业的劳动力需要量也增加了。今年工业、交通建设工程上所需要的临时工人除从城市调配外，还必须从农村中招收几十万人。积极组织人力去支援工业建设，充分满足工业建设对劳动力的需要，是农业生产合作社义不容辞的责任。
    由于农业合作化运动的迅速发展，广大农民群众都入了社。农民过去那种自动流入城市寻找工做的现象已基本消灭，而且发生了城市中的某些家居农村的工人流回农村的现象。这样，就出现了今春以来劳动力供应紧张的局面。据很多建筑企业反映，今年从农村招收工人有很大困难，常常不能完成任务。铁道部第四工程局第三工程处二月初计划在河北省招收杂工一千五百人，费了一个月时间，只完成原计划的75％。某些建筑工程常常因为缺少劳动力而推迟施工，或因劳动力供应失调不得不停工待工。另外，从农村中招来的工人，巩固工作也有困难。如承德市东冶一公司今春先后回农村的工人就占工人总数的30％。这种回家的现象随着麦收季节的来到日趋严重。
    为什么会发生招不来工人和临时工人要回家的现象呢？是不是因为农村劳动力已经不足供应农业生产的需要，根本不可能抽出部分人力来支援工业建设呢？不是的。一般地说，农业合作化以后，虽然农业生产及农村基本建设方面用的人力是大大增加了，但是由于农业合作社社员生产积极性的空前高涨，不仅生产出勤率将大大提高，而且由于较普遍地发动了妇女参加农业生产，给农村增加大批劳动力。因此，根据目前的情况，如不大量开展副业生产，除了少数地广人稀的地区外，农村劳动力是有多余的。据通县、香河、顺义县六个农业合作社劳动力的初步规划材料看，除去农业所需要的劳动力外，还平均剩余26％劳动力。由此可见目前农村是有人力来支援工业建设的。
    在农村招不到工人和临时工人要回农村的主要原因，首先是有些农村工作人员对国家工业建设的重大意义认识不足。他们强调农业增产任务大，劳动力不够，公开拒绝调出劳动力去支援工业建设。有些农业合作社劳动力本来有剩余，愿意输出些劳动力，也被一些区乡工作人员阻拦回去。有些县的工作人员接到招工任务后，就说：你是让我们搞工业，还是让我们搞农业呀？有些农业合作社工作人员不让社员出去作工，甚至出去了也要写信叫回来。一般的农业合作社在作劳动力规划的时候，没有把支援工业建设所需要的劳动力也计划进去。农民加入了农业合作社以后，在社的领导下进行着有组织有计划的生产，就不能像过去那样可以随便外出作工了。
    第二、一般农业合作社的劳动力报酬定得偏高，和工业基本建设壮工的工资过于悬殊。一般社员感到外出作工挣钱少，不如参加农业生产收入多，因此不愿外出作工。有的农业合作社规定社员外出作工所得工资，除本人伙食费外，全部交社，由社给记工，秋收在社内统一分红。这种办法不仅对社员外出作工缺乏鼓励作用，而且对提高建筑现场的劳动生产率也是不利的。还有的农业社规定外出作工社员每日交一元或一元五角，由社给记一个工。这种办法，使一些工人在达不到劳动定额，所得工资全部交社还不够的时候，就只好溜走了事。
    第三、建筑单位用人无计划、现要现抓，使劳动力调配部门无法预先准备，使农业合作社的人力使用不能得到合理的安排，因而也造成不能如期完成招工任务的困难。有些施工单位对临时工人的管理教育和关心不够，也影响农民支援工业建设的积极性。
    为了保证工业建设所需要的劳动力得到充分供应，应该在农村开展支援工业建设的宣传工作，使农村工作人员和农业合作社的社员认清工农联盟在社会主义建设中的重大意义，认识到农民不仅应当搞好农业生产多打粮食来支援工业建设，还应当积极组织人力来参加工业建设。组织人力参加工业建设是每个农业合作社的光荣任务。农业合作社不仅不应阻碍愿意外出参加建设的社员，还应当组织动员较好的社员来参加工业建设。组织一部分社员参加工业建设，不仅可以促进社内劳动力的合理使用，避免窝工浪费，还可以使社取得一定数量的劳动报酬，增加社的资金收入。希望农村工作人员，积极领导农业合作社作好劳动生产规划，把支援工业建设所需要的劳动力也规划进去。这就要通过算细账的方法，对劳动力进行合理安排，节约使用，充分发挥农村劳动力潜力，做到农业和工业所需要的劳动力都不耽误。并且要具体地协助建筑企业完成招工任务。
    关于社员外出作工的工资收入处理问题，一般应当本着鼓励社员积极参加工业建设的原则来解决。社员参加工业建设所得工资，除按社章规定交纳公积金和公益金外，应该全部归自己支配。或者是社员参加工业建设所得工资
  （按日标准工资计算）除提取若干生活补助费外，其余缴农业合作社。社按他在工地的实际出勤日数给他记同等劳动力的工分，秋收后，在社分红取酬。超过劳动定额所得工资、发明创造所得奖金应归自己支配；或按一定比例，交社一小部分。社员外出做工的工资收入处理问题是一个很复杂的问题，希望农村工作人员同志们能介绍一些比较成熟的经验来。
    在建筑企业方面，应当注意临时工人的工资福利待遇和政治思想教育工作。除适当地提高临时工人的工资标准外，应该大力提倡计件工资和超额奖励制度，以启发工人的生产积极性和创造性，使其多劳多得。建筑企业还应当积极采取措施，使工人达到定额和超过劳动定额，尽力改善临时工人的饮食、住宿等各项设备条件，关心他们的生活疾苦。企业的党、团、工会组织应当经常地注意工人的思想教育，以提高他们的社会主义觉悟，巩固他们的生产情绪，使他们提高劳动生产效率。
    我相信，只要县、区、乡的党委和人民委员会稍加注意，只要农村工作同志们稍加努力，动员农业生产合作社组织人力支援工业建设的事是不成问题的。重要的问题是各级劳动力调配机构，必须切实摸清建筑企业需要劳动力多少，掌握劳动力的来源，准确地制定劳动力调配计划，妥善地完成招工任务。
