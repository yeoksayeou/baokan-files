    A Model of Livestock Production Cooperatives
    The Wulan Aodu (Red Star) Livestock Production Cooperative in Ongniud Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was established in July 1952. It is one of the earliest livestock production cooperatives established in minority areas of China. Now, the cooperative has a total of twenty-two Mongolian herding households. Due to the collective management of livestock, the cooperative has greatly improved grazing and feeding management techniques, overcome various natural disasters, and steadily increased the number of livestock year by year. Breeds have also been improved. The members have moved from scattered settlements to living together, building beautiful new villages in areas with good water and grass, and fertile land. They have built new houses, cultivated orchards and vegetable gardens, opened up feed bases, and raised chickens and pigs. Children attend school, and adults are actively learning to read and write. They also have their own amateur troupe. The material and cultural life of the members has undergone fundamental changes. Everyone calls their cooperative the happy road to socialism.
    Many herdsmen in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region regard this cooperative as a model for them to learn from. The development process of the Wulan Aodu (Red Star) Livestock Production Cooperative over the past few years has also provided rich experience for the socialist transformation of animal husbandry throughout the country.

    In the first year of the cooperative's establishment, they cultivated 60 mu of feed farmland. This year, the members have newly reclaimed 150 mu of wasteland to expand the planting area for feed. The right picture shows the members reclaiming wasteland; the top picture shows the cultivation team leader talking with the cooperative's deputy director. He said: "Thanks to our creation of new tools, otherwise, these messy grass roots would be really difficult to deal with."
    Grapes, apricot trees, jujube trees, and wind-resistant poplar trees are planted in the cooperative's orchard. Every three to five days, the members come to water them. In a few years, they will be able to eat various fruits.
    The cooperative's amateur troupe performs regularly three times a month. With these moving songs and dances, life on the grassland is even more rich and colorful.
    Almost every member's family raises several chickens.
    Weaving fences is an important sideline production of the cooperative.
    The cooperative's school-age children are all studying in the village's primary school. During recreation time, the primary school students go to the grassland to sing and dance.
    Female members are sewing new clothes, preparing to participate in the annual Nadaam conference on July 1st.
    Members study culture in their spare time every day. When the cooperative was established in 1952, only two people were literate. Now, thirty-three people are participating in the civil school, and sixteen people can already read Mongolian newspapers and write simple letters.
    More than 170 lambs were born in the cooperative this year, more than 100 of which are fine-wool lambs. How lovely these fluffy little lambs are!

    畜牧业生产合作社的榜样
    内蒙古自治区翁牛特旗乌兰奥都（红星）畜牧业生产合作社是1952年7月建立的，这是我国在少数民族地区建立最早的一个畜牧业生产合作社。现在全社共有二十二户蒙族牧民。由于合作社集体经营畜牧业，大大改进了放牧和饲养管理技术，战胜了各种自然灾害，牲畜头数逐年稳步上升，品种也进行了改良。社员由散居而聚居，在水草优良、土地肥沃的地方，建设了美好的新村。他们盖了新的房子，培植了果园和菜园，开辟了饲料基地，养了鸡和猪。儿童们上了学，成年人也都在积极学文化。他们还有自己的业余剧团。社员们的物质和文化生活发生了根本性的变化。大家把自己的合作社叫做到社会主义的幸福之路。
    内蒙古自治区的许多牧民都把这个合作社当作他们学习的榜样。乌兰奥都（红星）畜牧业生产合作社几年来发展的过程，也给全国的畜牧业社会主义改造提供了丰富的经验。

    他们在建社的第一年就开垦了饲料耕地六十亩。今年，社员们又新开了荒地一百五十亩，扩大饲料种植面积。右图是社员正在垦荒；上图是耕作队长同合作社副主任在谈话，他说：多亏咱们创造了新工具，要不，这些乱草根子，实在没法儿对付。
    合作社的果园里栽种了葡萄、杏树、枣树和防风的白杨树。每隔三、五天，社员们都要来浇一次水。再过几年，就可以吃到各种水果了。
    合作社的业余剧团，每月定期演出三次。有了这些动人的歌舞，草原的生活更加丰富多采了。
    社员们差不多家家都养了几只鸡。
    编篱笆是合作社一项重要的副业生产。
    合作社的学龄儿童，都在村中的小学校里读书。娱乐活动时间，小学生们就到草地上唱歌跳舞。
    女社员缝新衣，准备到七月一日去参加全旗一年一度的那达慕大会。
    社员们每天在劳动之余学文化。1952年建社的时候，只有两个人识字，现在参加民校学习的有三十三人，有十六个人已经能读蒙文报纸和写简单的书信了。
    社里今年下了一百七十多只绵羊羔，其中有一百多只是细毛羊羔。这些毛茸茸的小羔子多么可爱！
