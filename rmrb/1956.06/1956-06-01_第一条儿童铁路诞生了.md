    The First Children's Railway is Born
    Dài Yuè
    On the afternoon of May 24th, the direct express train from Beijing to Moscow pulled into Harbin Station. A large group of children wearing red scarves surrounded it, looking at the locomotive and carriages, and asking the passengers all sorts of questions. These Young Pioneers were the young staff members of China's first children's railway, and this day they were at the station for practical training. A week later, this children's railway from "Beijing" to "Moscow" will be open to traffic. This children's railway has a total of seventy-four young staff members, mostly junior high school first and second year students. They have been using their spare time after school every day recently to participate in this activity.
    This children's railway only began construction on May 16th. To strive for opening on "June 1st," workers, office staff, and students throughout the city devoted an estimated 50,000 workdays during their holidays and moved a total of 22,000 cubic meters of earth to level the roadbed. The children's railway is built in Harbin's Nangang Park, in a beautiful environment, and is 2.1 kilometers long. "Beijing Station" and "Moscow Station" were built at the two ends of the park. The two small locomotives on the railway were originally used to transport timber on forest railways and were processed and modified by workers at the Forest Machinery Factory in their spare time. The four sightseeing carriages were made by workers at the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory using old materials and more than a thousand work hours. To build the children's railway, the Harbin Railway Administration transferred Su Xianmo, the chief engineer of the Planning Office, to serve as the chief engineer for the construction of the children's railway. Six other engineers also devoted their spare time to participate in the construction work. About 300 workers participated in laying the tracks. They laid the rails in just over two days.
    On May 30th, the children's railway was test-run, and the young railway employees dressed up. A driver wearing a red scarf boarded the locomotive nervously and excitedly, and the assistant driver followed him onto the car. The green signal was given, and the stationmaster waved a rolled-up small yellow flag up and down to the conductor several times, and the conductor then waved the flag in circles towards the driver. The whistle on the locomotive sounded, and the small train passed through dense woods and flower bushes, circling half a ring, and arrived at "Moscow Station." The train kept moving forward, passed through another half ring, and returned to "Beijing Station," taking a total of fifteen minutes.
    This children's railway will officially hold an opening ceremony on "June 1st," and Nangang Park will be renamed Children's Park at the same time.

    第一条儿童铁路诞生了
    戴月
    五月二十四日的下午，北京到莫斯科的直达快车开进了哈尔滨车站。这时一大群戴着红领巾的孩子们围上来，看看机车，看看车厢，又围着车上的旅客们问长问短。这些少先队员们就是中国第一条儿童铁路的小工作人员，这天是到车站上来实习的。一个星期以后这条从“北京”到“莫斯科”的儿童铁路就要通车了。这条儿童铁路共有七十四名小工作人员，大部分是初中一、二年级学生。他们最近每天都利用下午的课余时间参加这项活动。
    这条儿童铁路五月十六日才动工修建，为争取“六一”通车，全市的工人、机关工作人员、学生在假日付出了约计五万个劳动日，共抬了二万二千土方才垫好路基。儿童铁路修建在哈尔滨南岗公园里，环境优美，路长二点一公里，在公园的两头修建了“北京车站”、“莫斯科车站”。铁路的两台小机车原是森林铁路上运木材的，经过森林机械厂的工人在业余时间加工改制的。四节游览车厢是哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂的工人利用旧料花了一千多个工时才制成的。为修建儿童铁路，哈尔滨铁路管理局把计划事务所的总工程师苏显谟抽调出来担任修建儿童铁路的总工程师。还有六位工程师都抽出业余时间来参加修建工作。参加铺路的工人约有三百名。他们只用两天多的时间就把铁轨铺好了。
    五月三十日，儿童铁路试车了，小铁路员工们都装扮起来。一个戴着红领巾的司机紧张而又兴奋地登上了机车，副司机也随着上了车。绿色的信号发出来了，站长拿着一面卷起来的小黄旗向车长上下摆了几下，车长随即摆着旗子向着司机晃了几个圈，机车上汽笛响了，小火车穿过茂密的树林，穿过花丛，绕了半个环形，到了“莫斯科站”。火车一直往前开，又经过了一个半环形，回到了“北京站”，共花费了十五分钟。
    这条儿童铁路“六一”就要正式举行通车典礼，南岗公园同时改为儿童公园。
