Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 17th: The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's massive mechanical and electrical equipment installation project has begun acceptance.

From the third quarter of 1954 to the present, installation workers have installed thousands upon thousands of brand-new machines and equipment, various pipes, and electrical cables and wires; only about 3% of the entire installation project remains.

In the factory's ten major workshops, the installed machine tools are now as densely packed as chess pieces on a chessboard; the workshop with the most installed machinery and equipment has more than a thousand units.

Electrical installation is a very complex project in the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The factory's thermal power plant and various production workshops are equipped with modern remote-control and high-frequency quenching and other complex electrical equipment. Inside the electrical control rooms or control boxes in each workshop, control wiring networks like spider webs have been installed.

    据新华社长春17日电　第一汽车制造厂浩大的机电设备安装工程，已经开始交工验收。
    从1954年第三季度开始到目前为止，安装工人已经把成千上万台（套）崭新的机器设备、各种管子和电缆电线，安装了起来；全部安装工程现在只剩下3％左右了。
    在这个工厂的十大厂房里，现在安装好的机床，像密布在棋盘上的棋子一样；最多的一个厂房里所安装的机器设备，有一千台（套）以上。
    电气安装是第一汽车制造厂建设中一项很复杂的工程。在这个工厂的热电站和各个生产厂房里，装备了现代化的远距离操纵和高周波淬火等复杂的电气设备。在各个厂房里的电的控制室或控制箱内，安装了像蛛网一般的控制线路网。
