Chengdu, June 2 (by our newspaper) All parts of the country are enthusiastically supporting the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

　　In April and May of this year, many key tunnel and bridge projects in the middle section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway were short of cement, and construction was almost suspended waiting for materials. Workers at the Nanjing Jiangnan Cement Plant came up with many solutions and shipped large quantities of cement to the construction site ahead of schedule every month in April and May. The Sichuan Provincial Industrial Bureau and Construction Company and other units promptly allocated more than 200 tons of round steel and pig iron to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway construction site. Most of the more than 100 tons of steel recently allocated by the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company was delivered ahead of schedule. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company supplied the steel rails and accessories for the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which have already been laid for more than 500 kilometers of railway. The Changjiang (Yangtze River) Navigation Bureau transports at least 500 tons of materials to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway every month, and at most it has transported more than 1,000 tons.

    各地支援宝成路筑路工程
    本报成都2日电　全国各地热情支援宝成铁路的修筑工程。
    今年四、五月份，宝成路中段许多重点隧道和桥涵工程都缺乏水泥，几乎要停工待料。南京江南水泥厂的职工，想出许多办法，在四、五两月内，每月都提前把大批水泥发往工地。四川省工业局、建筑公司等单位，及时调拨给宝成路工地二百多吨圆钢和生铁。上海钢铁公司最近拨来的一百多吨钢材，多半是提前交货的。鞍山钢铁公司和重庆钢铁公司供给宝成路南段的钢轨和配件，已经铺成了五百多公里铁路。长江航务局每月最少给宝成路运输五百多吨材料，最多时运输了一千多吨。
