    Wheat Bumper Harvest on Newly Reclaimed Land

    In the northern suburbs of Xi'an, there is a vast expanse of grassland covering an area of more than 57,000 mu. The grassland is saline-alkali land with poor soil quality, and in the past, only weeds could grow there, and in some places, not even weeds grew.

    In 1952, the state established the State-owned Caotan Farm on the grassland and began to reclaim wasteland. Thanks to the use of various fertilizers to counteract alkalinity, this year's wheat crop on the newly reclaimed wasteland of more than 1,100 mu has yielded a bumper harvest, with an average yield of about 200 jin per mu.

    新开垦的土地上小麦丰收
    西安北郊，有一片辽阔的草滩地，总面积达五万七千多亩。草滩是砂碱地，土质不好，过去只能长一些野草，有的地方甚至连野草都不长。
    1952年，国家在草滩上设立了国营草滩农场，开始开垦荒地。由于采用了各种抵制碱性的肥料，新开垦荒地上的一千一百多亩小麦今年获得了丰收，每亩平均产量达二百斤左右。（附图片）
