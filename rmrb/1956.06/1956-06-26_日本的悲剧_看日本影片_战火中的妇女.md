    Japan's Tragedy
    ——Watching the Japanese Film "Women in the War"
    Liu Zhongping

    After seeing "Women in the War," if I were to summarize my impression in one sentence, I would say: This is Japan's tragedy. Of course, it is far from the entirety of the Japanese people's tragedy. From the printers' strike in the 1920s ("Street Without Sun") to a mother's tearful smile after the war ("It's All For Love"), all bear the imprint of tragedy. However, the "doomsday" on Saipan Island depicted in "Women in the War" is undoubtedly one of the most painful and heart-wrenching scenes in this tragedy.
    The final scenes of the film are almost emotionally unbearable. A group of innocent women are escorted by guards towards the surging sea. Instead of conveying any "heroic" element, it only makes one feel bleak. Did you see the longing for life that the girl who released the bird from its cage and the one who tearfully bid farewell to her puppy placed on the bird and puppy before throwing themselves into the sea? Did you feel the pain of the mother who desperately held her child high as she walked into the water that would engulf them? Did you hear the piercing gunshot that deprived a wife of the right to say a final farewell to her husband before his death? This woman who had experienced displacement and hardship in the war, who had been raped by a Japanese non-commissioned officer and was not forgiven by her husband, eventually leaving him, when her husband finally realized his mistake and rushed to say goodbye, they didn't even get the chance to exchange a word before she was shot dead by a soldier of her own country, for whom she may have even prayed for "continued good fortune in war," and fell from the cliff into the turbulent sea with her child on her back! What do you feel when you see this?
    This is hard for ordinary people to imagine. Yet it is a historical fact, albeit an excessively cruel one.
    The following is an excerpt from "A Pictorial History of the Pacific War" compiled by American journalist Robert Sherrod. This "pictorial history," which can hardly be said to be intended to expose the terrible disasters that war inflicts on ordinary people, contains the following account of the "doomsday" on Saipan Island:
    "When the American troops reached the northernmost tip of Saipan Island, they witnessed an utterly unbelievable and terrifying scene. Many Japanese civilians repeatedly threw themselves off the high cliffs into the rocky sea below. Some threw their children into the sea with their own hands, while others were forced into mass suicide by Japanese soldiers. Still others gathered together and detonated hand grenades to kill themselves. Japanese soldiers occasionally shot and killed Japanese civilians who refused to commit suicide. Within a few days, the bodies of Japanese men, women, and children were floating along the coast of the northern end of the island..." "Women in the War" depicts this historical fact. That was in the summer of 1944. American troops forcibly landed on Saipan Island on June 15th and occupied the entire island by July 8th. Ten days later, the Japanese government announced the "honorable death" of the military and civilians on Saipan Island.
    "Honorable death," this doesn't sound like an unpleasant phrase. However, what cruel and terrible facts are hidden behind this phrase! "Women in the War" reveals the truth of this so-called "honorable death," exposing the cruelty and inhumanity of Japanese militarism nakedly. The people are kind and innocent. They love the songs of birds and the floating clouds in the blue sky; they understand love and expect the birth of new life. However, in this unjust war, harmonious families were torn apart, and newly born children faced death. They died not on the road of displacement, but under the bombing of American planes, amidst the machine gun fire of their own soldiers. The Japanese army, nearing its end, was so insane that it didn't even want to spare an ignorant child, as if the child's crying would really attract enemy shells. Those soldiers, filled with blind faith and ignorance, arbitrarily insulted the women on the island and indulged in wild revelry in the comfort stations, seemingly completely losing their humanity. Yet these soldiers were also pitiful sacrifices. They were driven to distant islands to wage this unjust war, for what? What did their parents and wives get from this war? Nothing but the heavy burden of life, ashes, and tears. Perhaps some of their wives and daughters left in their homeland, unable to survive under the heavy pressure of the war, drifted to other places' comfort stations and were being brutally ravaged by other soldiers. Who knows? Did they ever think about these things? Perhaps they didn't dare to think, didn't want to think, or simply couldn't think? They finally blindly carried out the cruel order to "build a breakwater in the Pacific with our bodies," escorting the innocent women and children who had survived by chance and letting them drown in the vast sea.
    This is the real tragedy.
    War not only destroys people's bodies, but also damages their souls. "Why didn't I think of it in the past?" This is a painful question asked by the pastor Muraki, who did not forgive his wife for being defiled in danger, causing the family to be torn apart. From this question, we hear the Japanese ordinary people's deep reflection on their past fate and their awakening.
    The tragedy of Saipan Island did not begin on the day the American troops landed, or even with the attack on Pearl Harbor; to put it closer, the explosion at Liutiaogou, and further back, the rise of the "Korean Conquest Theory" in the Meiji era, all sowed the seeds of this tragedy. "A nation that oppresses other peoples cannot be free itself." The advanced elements among the Japanese people knew this truth long ago. However, their voices were stifled. What the Japanese ordinary people could hear were myths such as "unbroken imperial line for eternity" and "the whole world under one roof," and the warmongering cries of "Yamato spirit" and "Bushido." The people were tied to the samurai's war chariot.
    "Women in the War" reveals the injustice of the war launched by Japan, and the deep disasters that the war brought to the Japanese people. This is a great contribution to the Japanese people, and also a great contribution to the cause of peace. After seeing the scene of piled up corpses at the end of the film, and listening again to the flat, emotionless voice of the Japanese Emperor reading the declaration of war, the Japanese people will not fail to bow their heads in contemplation.
    "Women in the War" helps us to understand more deeply the brutal persecution of its own people by Japanese fascist militarism. With such realistic artistic power, it aroused our sympathy for those kind and innocent people, so that after watching this film, our mood could not be relieved for a long time. Every mother knows the joy and hardship of giving birth to and raising a child. May Japanese children no longer suffer the sad fate of being born only to die. May the brilliant cherry blossoms no longer be used as a cover for treating human life as mere grass.
    The unjust war launched by the Japanese fascist militarists was a catastrophe for the peoples of the invaded countries, including our Chinese people, and for its own people. But we are not vengeful people. We understand sympathy and humanity. Regarding the Japanese people, Mr. Lu Xun said in an old poem written during the January 28th Incident:
    "After weathering the storms, brothers remain,
    A smile at meeting dissolves all grievances." Today, the Chinese people have already "weathered the storms," but the Japanese people have not completely ended their suffering. Now, the American samurai want to tie the Japanese people to the war chariot again, and make them follow "Honest John" to fight. But we believe that the Japanese people who have recognized the truth of the Saipan Island tragedy, and the Japanese people who have stood up from the ruins of Hiroshima, will not be so easily fooled into becoming cannon fodder. War has educated the people, and the Japanese people will sooner or later use their own strength to create a brand-new era, which will be an era full of the joy of life.

    日本的悲剧
    ——看日本影片“战火中的妇女”
    刘仲平
    看了“战火中的妇女”，如果用一句话概括我的印象，我想说：这是日本的悲剧。当然它远不是日本人民的悲剧的全部。从二十年代印刷工人的罢工（“没有太阳的街”）到战后一个母亲的含泪的微笑（“正是为了爱”），都带有悲剧的烙印。然而“战火中的妇女”所描写的塞班岛的“末日”，无疑地却是这悲剧里最惨痛、最凄怆的场景之一。
    影片最后的几个场面，几乎是使人在感情上忍受不了的。一群无辜的妇女在卫兵的押解之下朝着白浪滔滔的大海前进。这里面与其说有什么“悲壮”成分，不如说只能使人觉得惨然。你看到没有：在投海之前，那个从笼子里放出鸟儿和那个同小狗呜咽作别的少女在鸟儿和小狗身上所寄托的生的留恋？你感觉到没有：一面向水深没顶的地方走去，一面却拚命高举着孩子的那个母亲的痛楚的心？你听到没有：那声凄厉的枪响，怎样夺去了一个妻子同一个丈夫死前诀别的权利？这个在战火中历经颠沛流离的女人，这个受到本国下士官的奸污、而又得不到丈夫的谅解、终于同丈夫离开了的女人，当最后丈夫醒悟过来，赶来同她诀别的时候，他们竟连交谈一句话的机会都没有得到，她就死在她也许曾为之祈祷过“武运长久”的本国士兵的枪下了，而且连同她背上的孩子从绝岩峭壁之上跌下了惊涛拍岸的大海！看到这里，你会作何感想？
    这是常人所难于想像的。然而这是历史事实，虽然未免是过于残酷的事实。
    下面是美国记者罗伯特·谢罗德所编著的“太平洋战争画史”里的一段记述。这本很难说是意在揭露战争加给普通人民的可怕灾难的“画史”，关于塞班岛的“末日”，却也有着这样一段记述：
    “当美军到达塞班岛最北端的时候，在那儿目击了完全令人不能置信的可怕情景。很多日本侨民，从高高的峭壁向乱石林立的海中接连地投身自杀。其中也有把自己的孩子亲手扔到海里的，也有为日本兵强迫着进行集体自杀的。还有一些人，聚在一起拉响手榴弹自炸而死。对于拒绝自杀的日本侨民，日本兵则不时地开枪射杀。几天之间，这个岛北端海岸一带都漂流着日本人男女老幼的尸体。……”“战火中的妇女”所描写的就是这段史实。那是在1944年夏天。美军从六月十五日在塞班岛强行登陆，到七月八日就占领了全岛。十天之后，日本政府宣布了塞班岛军民“玉碎”。
      “玉碎”，这不算是一个难听的字眼。然而在这个字眼的背后却隐藏着多么残酷可怕的事实！“战火中的妇女”展示了这所谓“玉碎”的真相，赤裸裸地暴露了日本军国主义的残忍和灭绝人性。人民是善良无辜的。他们喜欢小鸟的歌声，喜欢蓝天上的浮云；他们懂得爱，也期待着新生命的降生。然而在这场不义的战争中，和睦的家庭被拆散了，刚诞生的孩子就面临着死亡。他们不是死在辗转流徙的路上，就是死在美机的轰炸之下，死在本国士兵的机枪扫射声中。临近末日的日本军队，竟疯狂到这样的程度，甚至不想放过一个无知的孩子，仿佛那孩子的哭声真会招来敌人的炮弹似的。那些被盲信和愚昧灌满了脑袋的士兵，随意地侮辱岛上的妇女，在随军妓院里疯狂地作乐，似乎完全失去了人性。然而就是这些士兵，其实也是可怜的牺牲。他们被驱使到遥远的海岛上来进行这场不义的战争，是为了什么？他们的父母妻子从这场战争中得到了什么？那不过是生活的重压、骨灰和眼泪罢了。也许他们留在故国的妻女，有的在战争重压之下活不下去而流落到其他地方的随军妓院，正在受到其他士兵的疯狂的作践，这又有谁知道呢？他们是不是想过这些？也许他们是不敢想、不愿意想、或是根本不会想？他们终于盲目地执行了“用我们的身体筑成太平洋的堤防”的残忍的命令，押送着那些侥幸活了下来的无辜的妇女和孩子，让他们葬身到茫茫的大海里去了。
    这是真正的悲剧。
    战争不仅毁灭了人们的肉体，也毁坏了人的灵魂。“为什么过去就没有想到呢？”这是影片里那个没有谅解妻子在危难中被人玷污、一家人拆散得各自一方的牧村发出的一句沉痛的疑问。从这句问话里，我们听到了日本普通人民对于自己过去的命运的深思和他们的觉醒。
    塞班岛的悲剧，并不是从美军登陆那天开始的，甚至也不是从珍珠港的袭击开始的；近些说，柳河沟的那声爆炸，远些说，明治年代的“征韩论”的得势，其中就都播下了这悲剧的种子。“压迫他族人民的民族，自己也是不能自由的。”日本人民中间的先进人物早就知道这个道理。然而他们的声音被扼杀了。日本普通人民能够听到的是“万世一系”“八紘一宇”之类的神话，是“大和魂”“武士道”的黩武主义的叫嚣。人民被绑到武士的战车上了。
      “战火中的妇女”，揭露了日本所发动的这场战争的不义，揭露了战争带给日本人民的深灾大难，这是对日本人民的一个很大贡献，也是对和平事业的一个很大贡献。看了影片末尾的积尸累累的画面，再重新听听日本天皇宣读宣战诏书的那平板的毫无感情的声音，日本人民不会不低下头去沉思。
      “战火中的妇女”帮助我们更深切地了解了日本法西斯军国主义对于它本国人民的残暴的迫害的一面。它以那样逼真的艺术力量，激起了我们对于那些善良无辜的人民的同情，以至看完这个影片之后，我们的心情久久不能释然。每个母亲都知道生育和抚养一个孩子的喜悦和艰辛。愿日本孩子不再遭到那出生就是死亡的可悲的命运吧。愿那灿烂的樱花不再作为视人命如草芥的掩饰吧。
    日本法西斯军国主义者所发动的这场不义的战争，对于被侵略的各族人民，包括我们中国人民在内，以及对于它本国的人民，都是一场浩劫。但我们不是记仇的人。我们懂得同情和人道。对于日本人民，鲁迅先生早在写于一二八事变中的一首旧诗中就曾说过：
    “度尽劫波兄弟在，相逢一笑泯恩仇。”今天，中国人民是已经“度尽劫波”了，但日本人民却还没有完全结束他们的苦难。现在，美国的武士又想重新把日本人民绑上战车，要他们跟着“诚实的约翰”去作战。但是，我们相信，认识了塞班岛悲剧的真相的日本人民，从广岛的废墟中站起来的日本人民，不会那么轻易地去当傻瓜的炮灰了。战争教育了人民，日本人民迟早会用自己的力量开创一个崭新的时代的，那将是充满了生的欢乐的时代。
