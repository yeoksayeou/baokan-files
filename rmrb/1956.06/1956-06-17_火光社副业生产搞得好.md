To the Editor:

The Huoguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Pu County, Shanxi Province, has always attached importance to sideline production. This year, after the spring, they organized agricultural work and manpower, dividing labor according to each member's expertise and labor efficiency. At the beginning of spring, the cooperative, without affecting spring plowing, stubble clearing, and fertilizer delivery, extracted twelve female members to burn more than 80,000 catties of lime, selling it for 1,160 yuan. After spring plowing and sowing began, the cooperative brought back all those engaged in sideline activities, concentrating on sowing. By May 11, the main autumn crops such as millet and corn had been completely sown; at this time, in addition to leaving some members to plant yams, plow millet fields, and accumulate fertilizer, the cooperative extracted twelve female members and nine male members to engage in the sideline production of burning lime, burning a total of 140,000 catties of lime, selling it for 2,800 yuan. These two sideline lime-burning activities, after deducting costs, yielded a net profit of more than 3,000 yuan. In addition, the cooperative also used the time before spring plowing and sowing and after the basic planting of autumn crops, extracting two laborers and two large carts to haul equipment and cement for the Highway Bureau, also earning 510 yuan.

This spring, the cooperative's income from sideline production, about 1,300 yuan, was used to buy seeds, fodder, small farm tools, two carts, and two mules. The remaining 2,375 yuan was decided by the cooperative to be used to solve the members' expenses for buying salt, vinegar, and making clothes. The whole cooperative has seventy-six households, and each household can generally receive three to five yuan per month; as for individual members with special difficulties and those lacking food and money, they were also taken care of. Four households lacking food and money bought more than 500 catties of grain with the help of the cooperative. After the death of member He Laicheng's mother, his financial situation was difficult, so the cooperative took the initiative to lend him twenty-five yuan for burial expenses.

The members are very satisfied with this situation. Everyone generally reflects: this year the sowing was completed early, the quality of agricultural work was also done well, and sideline activities were also carried out well, earning so much money, which is something that has never happened in our village.

    火光社副业生产搞得好编辑同志：
    山西蒲县城关乡火光农业社一贯重视副业生产。今年开春后，他们将农活和劳动力排了队，按每个社员的特长和劳动效能进行分工。开春时，社里在不影响春垡、刨茬子和送肥的条件下，抽出十二个女社员烧石灰八万多斤，卖钱1，160元。春耕播种开始后，社里就把搞副业的人全部抽回来，集中力量进行播种。到五月十一日，谷子、玉米等主要大秋作物已经全部种完；这时候社里除了留下一部分社员做播种山药蛋、垡糜子地、积肥等工作外，又抽出女社员十二个、男社员九个去搞烧石灰的副业，共烧石灰十四万斤，卖钱二千八百元。这两次烧石灰的副业，除去成本，净赚人民币三千多元。此外，社里又利用春耕播种前和大秋作物基本种完后的时间，抽出两个劳力和两辆大车给公路局拉用具和水泥，也挣了人民币510元。
    今年春季社里搞副业生产的收入，有一千三百元左右用来买种籽、草料、小农具和两辆车、两头骡子。余下2，375元钱，社里决定用来解决社员买盐打醋、做衣服等零花钱的问题。全社共七十六户，每户每月一般可以支三元到五元；至于个别有特殊困难的社员和缺粮缺钱的社员也得到了照顾。有四户缺粮缺钱户在社的帮助下买了五百多斤粮食。社员贺来成的母亲死后，经济情况困难，社里就主动的借给他二十五元钱作埋葬费。
    社员们对这种情况非常满意。大家普遍反映：今年下种完成得早，农活质量也做得好，还搞好副业赚下那么多的钱，这是咱村从来没有过的事。
