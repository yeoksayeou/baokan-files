Cai Xiuyu of Shanghai, who is good at aggressive attacks, also lost only one match in the second round of the competition (losing to Yang Qiwen by a score of zero to three). She had the same number of net wins as Yang Qiwen, but the total score of each game was four points less than Yang Qiwen, so she won second place in the women's singles.
