Problems urgently needing solution in Shandong's local state-owned industry

——Representative Qian Changzhao

Recently, I inspected eight relatively typical local state-owned factories in the Jinan, Qingdao, and Zibo areas of Shandong Province. I feel that there are some problems that urgently need to be resolved, and these problems may also exist in other provinces. Today, I am raising them for your reference.

I. The plans for Shandong's local state-owned industry change frequently, making production units feel passive. Tasks increase and decrease suddenly, and work is sometimes tight and sometimes loose. When it is tight, they work overtime, sometimes without even resting on Sundays. When it is loose, there is even idleness. The main reason for the frequent changes in plans is that the investigation and research work is not done well enough, the statistical work has no foundation, and the local planning agencies are not very sound. This situation may continue for some time. Therefore, the seriousness and flexibility of the local state-owned industrial plan must be well combined.

II. In the development of Shandong's local state-owned industry, the need for various materials is increasing day by day. Although the amount of materials allocated by the central government has also increased, and Shandong Province itself is also actively tapping its potential, the supply and demand are often extremely unbalanced. The supply figures are both insufficient and the goods do not arrive in time, making it really difficult to arrange production. For example, in the Qingdao Machinery Factory, which was inspected this time, the raw materials for the single-furrow plow in the first quarter mostly arrived at the factory after February 22nd, resulting in a loose front and a tight back, and a final rush. These are issues related to the supply of materials. As for the problem of product sales, it is also quite serious. The relationship between industry and commerce has recently been quite tense, with mutual complaints and buck-passing. The poor quality of industrial products has indeed brought a lot of trouble to the commercial departments, and the commercial departments' purchase plans are often proposed too late and change frequently, making it difficult to arrange industrial production. In addition, disputes constantly arise regarding specifications, acceptance, processing fees, and profit distribution. Some disputes take a long time to resolve, affecting the completion of the entire plan. Our economy is developing rapidly, and there will inevitably be contradictions between industry and commerce, but these contradictions can be unified. It is hoped that the planning departments will do their best to ensure that industrial and commercial plans are interconnected, and that both industry and commerce should strive to overcome departmentalism, seriously study matters, and actively negotiate solutions.

III. The houses and equipment of local state-owned industry are generally relatively old, and accidents occur frequently. For example, in the Shandong Cement Plant, which was inspected this time, the dust is heavy, the temperature is high, the labor intensity is high, which affects the health of the workers, and there are many accidents. Other factories, such as the Qingdao Machinery Factory, Knitting Factory, Zibo Acid Plant, and Jinan Match Factory, all have safety and health problems. Local state-owned industries should make the best use of old houses and equipment that can be utilized, but if they are not repaired and supplemented in time, it will inevitably cause great losses. Regarding this point, a comprehensive inspection is already necessary, and the appropriation of funds for repairs should not be delayed too much.

IV. More than half of the eight local state-owned factories I inspected have product quality problems, either because the leadership places too much emphasis on quantity and not enough on quality, or because of one-sided savings, arbitrarily lowering consumption quotas, or because the technical force is too weak, or because the equipment is too old, or because there are no quality standards, or because there are a lack of operating procedures. These are all quite serious problems. After a serious inspection by the local industrial conference, the quality of certain products has improved significantly recently, but at this moment, we must prevent deviations in another direction. While improving quality, we must pay special attention to reducing costs and increasing labor productivity.

V. The technical force of local state-owned industry is very weak, and there is a great shortage of technical personnel. The Shandong Provincial Department of Industry, including its directly affiliated production units, has only 21 engineers and technicians. The industrial bureaus of various cities, including their affiliated production units, have only 19 engineers and technicians, while there are 273 local state-owned factories in Shandong Province. Some technical problems simply cannot be solved. For example, the paint factory, which was inspected this time, has very high enthusiasm among its workers, but because of the lack of senior technical personnel, the quality problem has not been resolved for a long time. Other factories have similar situations. The various ministries and commissions of the central government have heavy tasks themselves, and it is indeed difficult to transfer personnel to provide support. The main method is for the local governments to intensify training themselves. Shandong Province's local state-owned industry has not done enough work in this area. Learning and re-learning, training and re-training are the top priorities. Technical employees with good political qualities and strong business capabilities who can take on more responsibilities should be promoted to more important positions as soon as possible.

VI. In 1954 and 1955, the growth rate of wages for employees in Shandong's local state-owned industry was not commensurate with the rate of increase in labor productivity. In 1954, labor productivity increased by 31.42% compared to 1953, monetary wages decreased by 3%, and real wages decreased by 4.05%. In 1955, labor productivity increased by 19.66% compared to 1954, monetary wages increased by 1.54%, and real wages increased by 0.3%. The lives of employees are quite difficult. Now Shandong Province is conducting investigations and research based on the spirit of the National Wage Reform Conference, and hopes to formulate and resolve the adjustment plan as soon as possible.

VII. The employee dormitories of Shandong's local state-owned industry are generally insufficient. The existing collective dormitories and family dormitories, many of which were inspected this time, are quite crowded. Some families of six or seven people live in one small room, and some cook in the open air. As for employees who have no dormitories to live in, some have to travel ten or twenty miles back and forth every day. In addition to the general shortage of dormitories, there are also some unreasonable phenomena in the allocation of existing dormitories. Factories A and B are far apart, but the employees of Factory A live in dormitories near Factory B, and the employees of Factory B live in dormitories near Factory A. For the present, it is very urgent to appropriately increase investment in dormitories and rationally adjust existing dormitories. As for the general welfare of employees, there are also many problems waiting to be solved. Many factories still do not have canteens. Health stations, nurseries, bathhouses, etc. are also not very complete. During the inspection period, I held six discussions with about 55 representative employee comrades. They reflected a lot on safety and health issues, dormitory issues, and general welfare issues. They were all calm and composed, and put forward completely reasonable demands, but they put forward a lot of relatively sharp opinions on individual factory leaders who did not care about the lives of employees. I have been to the homes of these leaders. They themselves live a fairly hard life, but because they do not care much about the lives of the masses, they are blamed by the masses. It is indeed necessary to appropriately improve the employee welfare of Shandong's local state-owned industry.

VIII. Finally, what I want to say is that Shandong is a coastal province. In the past few years, due to the tense international situation, local state-owned industry has neither been newly built nor expanded. Now that the international situation is easing, perhaps we can build a few new units and expand some units, but the new construction must have particularly good conditions, and the supply, production, and sales must not be a problem. The expansion should give priority to exerting the existing equipment capacity. The equipment utilization rate of Shandong Province's local state-owned industry is generally very low. Furthermore, design work is very important for new construction and expansion. Shandong Province's technical force is so weak that it may not be able to handle it. It is hoped that the various ministries and commissions of the central government will provide assistance within the scope possible.

    山东地方国营工业急待解决的问题
    ——钱昌照代表
    最近我在山东省济南、青岛、淄博三个地区视察了八个比较典型的地方国营工厂，觉得有些问题，急待解决，而这些问题别省可能也有，今天提出来供各位参考。
    一、山东省地方国营工业的计划变动较多，生产单位感到被动，任务忽增忽减，工作时紧时松，紧的时候，加班加点，有时连星期日都不休息，松的时候甚至发生窝工。计划的所以变动频繁，主要原因是调查研究工作做得不够，统计工作没有基础，地方计划机构也不甚健全。这种情况，可能还会继续一个时期。因此，地方国营工业计划的严肃性和灵活性必须好好结合。
    二、山东省地方国营工业在发展中，各种物资的需要日渐增加。中央分配的物资数量，虽然也有所增加，山东省本身虽然也在积极挖掘潜力，但供需方面经常出现极不平衡的现象。供应的数字既感不足，到货又不及时，布置生产真不容易。即如此次视察的青岛机械厂，第一季度单铧犁的原材料，大部分二月二十二日以后方才陆续到厂，结果工作前松后紧，末了突击。这些是有关物资供应的问题。至于产品销售问题，也是相当严重。工商关系最近颇为紧张，互相埋怨，互相推诿。工业产品质量不好诚哉为商业部门带来不少麻烦，商业部门进货计划，往往提得太晚，而且经常变动，也使得工业生产不好安排。此外在规格方面、验收方面、工缴费方面、利润分配方面，不断发生争执，有些争执，好久得不到解决，影响整个计划的完成。我国经济，正在迅速发展，工商之间必然会有矛盾，但这些矛盾是可以统一的，希望计划部门尽可能做到工商计划互相衔接，而工商双方更应该努力克服本位主义，遇事认真研究，主动协商办理。
    三、地方国营工业的房屋设备，一般比较陈旧，事故经常发生。即如此次视察的山东水泥厂，由于粉尘多，温度高，劳动强度大，影响职工身体健康，事故也不少。其他如青岛机械厂、针织厂、淄博制酸厂、济南火柴厂等，安全卫生，都有问题。地方国营工业对于陈旧的房屋设备，凡是可以利用的，都应该尽量利用，但若不能及时修理补充，势必造成很大损失。关于这一点，全面检查已有必要，拨款修补，不宜过于迟缓。
    四、我所视察的八个地方国营工厂，过半数存在着产品质量问题，或则由于领导思想重数量轻质量，或则由于片面节约，擅自降低消耗定额，或则由于技术力量过于薄弱，或则由于设备过于陈旧，或则由于质量没有标准，或则由于缺乏操作规程，这些都是相当严重的问题。经过地方工业会议认真检查，最近某些产品质量有显著的好转，但此刻又得防止另一方面的偏差。在提高质量的同时，对于成本的降低，劳动生产率的提高，必须特别注意。
    五、地方国营工业的技术力量十分薄弱，技术人员非常缺乏。山东省工业厅包括直属生产单位在内，只有工程师与技师21名，各市工业局包括所属的生产单位在内，只有工程师与技师19名，而山东省地方国营工厂就有273个单位。有些技术问题，根本解决不了。即如此次视察的油漆厂，职工劳动热情甚高，就因为缺乏高级技术人员，质量问题好久得不到解决。其他各厂，也有类似的情况。中央各部会本身任务繁重，调配支持，确有困难。主要办法，是由地方自己加紧培养。山东省地方国营工业这方面的工作做得不够。学习再学习，训练再训练乃是当务之急，对于政治品质好业务能力强、可以多负一些责任的技术员工，更应当从速提拔到比较重要的岗位上来。
    六、1954、1955两年，山东省地方国营工业职工工资的增长速度，和劳动生产率的提高速度是不相适应的。1954年比1953年劳动生产率提高31.42％，货币工资降低3％，实际工资降低4.05％；1955年比1954年劳动生产率提高19.66％，货币工资增长1.54％，实际工资增长0.3％。职工生活相当艰苦。现在山东省正根据全国工资改革会议的精神进行调查研究，希望能够早日拟制调整方案，予以解决。
    七、山东省地方国营工业的职工宿舍，普遍不足，现有的集体宿舍，家属宿舍，此次视察了许多，拥挤现象，相当严重，有一家六、七口住在一间小屋里的，有在露天做饭的，至于没有宿舍住的职工，有的每天来回要走一、二十里地。除宿舍普遍不足外，现有宿舍的分配，也有些不合理的现象，甲乙二厂相去甚远，甲厂职工住在乙厂附近的宿舍里，乙厂职工住在甲厂附近的宿舍里。为今之计，适当增加宿舍投资，合理调整现有的宿舍，是十分迫切的。至于职工一般福利，也有不少问题，等待解决。许多工厂到现在还没有食堂。保健站、托儿站、浴池等等也不甚完备。视察期内，先后约同有代表性的职工同志55人座谈6次。他们在安全卫生问题、宿舍问题和一般福利问题上，反映很多。他们都心平气和，提出完全合理的要求，但对个别不关心职工生活的工厂领导同志提出不少比较尖锐的意见。这些领导同志的家里我都去过，他们自己生活也相当艰苦，但由于不甚关心群众生活，因此受到群众的责备。山东地方国营工业的职工福利，确有适当改进的必要。
    八、最后我想说的就是山东为沿海省份，过去几年，由于国际形势紧张，地方国营工业，既无新建，也不扩建，现在国际形势趋于缓和，也许可以新建几个单位，扩建一些单位，但新建的必须条件特别好，供产销不成问题，扩建的应该尽先发挥已有的设备能力，山东省地方国营工业的设备利用率一般都是很低的。再则新建扩建，设计工作非常重要，山东省技术力量如此薄弱，恐难胜任，希望中央各部会在可能范围内予以协助。
