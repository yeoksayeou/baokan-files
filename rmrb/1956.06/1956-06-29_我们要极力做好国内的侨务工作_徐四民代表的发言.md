I have read the 1955 National Final Accounts, the 1956 National Budget, and listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the final accounts and budget. I also participated in the meticulous discussions of the Overseas Chinese Representative Group. I affirm that this is a very proper and complete final accounts and budget proposal. Moreover, it is a final accounts and budget proposal that conforms to the wishes of the people of the whole country, including overseas Chinese, for peaceful construction.

In the budget, the expenditure for economic construction in 1956 is more than 16 billion yuan, accounting for 52.22% of the budget expenditure, an increase of 17.04% over 1955; the expenditure for national defense in 1956 is more than 6.1 billion yuan, accounting for 19.98% of the budget expenditure, a decrease of 2.17% compared with 1955. These two simple figures clearly illustrate our country's determination to carry out peaceful construction!

In recent years, many foreign visiting groups have come to visit our country. Some of them came with shadows of fear and doubt, but after the visit, they all returned with trust and friendship. All this is not because the comrades responsible for the reception had any reception "tricks" or "eloquent words" to convince our guests, but because the Chinese people, for the sake of a bright socialist future, are engaged in arduous and great construction, selfless labor, and the living facts of the great achievements they have made, which moved them.

I live in Burma, and Burma is our friendly neighbor. The overseas Chinese in Burma have had traditional friendly relations with the local people in the past. Since Premier Zhou and Prime Minister U Nu visited each other and issued the world-renowned joint statement on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the friendly relations between China and Burma have greatly increased on the original basis. In the past two years, various friendly visiting groups from the two countries have visited each other, increasing deeper understanding and leaving no room for imperialist rumor-mongers and provocateurs. Sino-Burmese trade based on equality and mutual benefit is also developing smoothly, setting a good example of peaceful coexistence for other countries in the world, especially Asian and African countries. In recent years, the overseas Chinese in Burma have deeply understood the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and promoted the fine tradition of friendship with the local government and people. Deep friendship is constantly developing with the enhancement of friendly relations between the two countries. As far as I personally know, the situation of overseas Chinese living in India, Indonesia, Cambodia and other countries is roughly the same.

I have read the "Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives (Draft)" and I have also listened to Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of this draft, and I fully agree with and support it. Minister Liao pointed out in his explanation the importance of appropriately taking care of the families of martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized soldiers; taking care of the physiological characteristics and physical strength of female members, as well as the actual needs of housework; taking care of the characteristics of the nationalities and giving full play to the special skills of the nationalities, etc. These are completely necessary and correct. Now I would like to raise some issues related to returned overseas Chinese and their families for the relevant parties to refer to. Because returned overseas Chinese and their families also have some characteristics that deserve our attention: (1) Although overseas Chinese have a fine tradition of loving labor, because the strong labor force is abroad, those left in their hometowns are generally the old, weak, women and children with poorer labor power; (2) Most overseas Chinese themselves live in foreign capitalist societies, while their families live in the socialist transformation environment of the motherland. The relationship between the two different social systems is already complicated, and it is natural that we cannot demand a very high level of understanding of the transformation process from them all at once. Therefore, in the process of agricultural cooperation, we should pay attention to the above-mentioned characteristics, rationally arrange and use the labor force of overseas Chinese families, take care of their labor habits, and pay special attention to doing a good job in unity based on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, so that deviations will not occur again in the movement, causing worries and unease among overseas Chinese abroad. Last year, in some individual hometowns of overseas Chinese, cadres did not properly implement the central government's overseas Chinese affairs policy, and many shortcomings appeared in the handling of grain, causing unnecessary worries to overseas Chinese abroad. We should make more "foresight" for the future of our work and prevent problems before they occur. If we review after deviations have occurred, but the country's overseas reputation has already been damaged, then it is completely unnecessary.

Overseas Chinese love the motherland and love their hometowns. Their relationship with their families and relatives in their hometowns is inextricably linked. They often receive letters from their relatives that are "worth ten thousand gold." From the letters, they listen to their relatives narrating the new atmosphere of various constructions in the motherland after liberation, comforting their hearts longing for the motherland in the distance. They also use the content of the letters as materials for external propaganda. Therefore, we absolutely cannot underestimate the influence of letters from relatives of overseas Chinese on overseas Chinese abroad, let alone underestimate the influence of more than 10 million overseas Chinese scattered in Southeast Asia and other countries on the outside world. Therefore, we must strive to do a good job in domestic overseas Chinese affairs, but to do a good job in overseas Chinese affairs, relying solely on overseas Chinese affairs agencies is not enough. It is necessary for the people of the whole country and all relevant departments of the Party and government to recognize the special circumstances of overseas Chinese and work together to achieve the desired results.

This time when I returned to China, I not only attended the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, but also attended the Fourth National Overseas Chinese Affairs Enlarged Conference convened by the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission a few days ago. At the enlarged conference, I listened to the reports of the leaders and many representatives of returned overseas Chinese and their families. I realized the government's concern for overseas Chinese affairs. I believe that after the Fourth Overseas Chinese Affairs Enlarged Conference closes, the work of overseas Chinese affairs will be done better in the future.

Thank you, great motherland!
Thank you, great Chairman Mao!

### 我们要极力做好国内的侨务工作——徐四民代表的发言

    我们要极力做好国内的侨务工作 
    ——徐四民代表的发言
    我阅读了1955年国家决算、1956年国家预算，并听到李先念副总理关于这个决算和预算的报告，我也参加了华侨代表小组进行了缜密的讨论，我肯定了这是一个很妥善完整的决算和预算案。而且是一个符合全国人民包括国外华侨愿望的和平建设的决算和预算案。
    预算中1956年经济建设的支出为160余亿元，占预算支出的52.22％，比1955年增长17.04％；1956年国防费的支出为61亿余元，占支出预算的19.98％，比1955年下降2.17％；从这两个简单的数目字说明了我国进行和平建设的决心，是再清楚也没有的了！
    几年来，许多外国的访问团到了我国访问，有一部分是带着恐惧和疑虑的影子而来的，可是在访问完毕后，都带着信任和友好的心情回去。这一切并不是我们负责招待的同志们有什么招待“妙术”或是“口吐莲花”把我们的客人说得信服了，而是中国人民为了社会主义美好的将来，进行坚苦伟大的建设，忘我的劳动，所取得伟大的成就的活生生的事实，叫他们感动的。
    我是住在缅甸的，缅甸是我国的芳邻。缅甸的华侨跟当地的人民过去有着传统的友好的关系。自从周总理和吴努总理互相访问并发表了举世闻名的和平共处的五项原则的共同声明之后，中缅两国的友好关系在原有的基础上又大大的增长起来。两年来两国的各种友好访问团，来往访问，增加了彼此更深的了解，给帝国主义的造谣挑拨者没有立足的余地。在平等互利基础上的中缅贸易，也在顺利的发展着，给世界上其他的国家，特别是亚非国家，树立了和平共处的好榜样。几年来缅甸华侨，深深地体会了和平共处的五项原则的精神，发扬了和当地政府及人民友好的优良传统。深厚的友谊随着两国友好邦交的增进而在不断的发展着。据我个人所知，我国住在印度、印度尼西亚、柬埔寨等国的华侨，情况也是大体上相同的。
    我读了“高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”我也听了廖鲁言部长对这草案的说明，我完全同意和拥护。廖部长在说明中指出适当照顾烈属、军属和复员军人；照顾了女社员的生理特点和体力、家务劳动的实际需要；照顾了民族的特点，发挥了民族的特长，……等的重要性，这些完全是必要而且正确的。现在我提出了一些有关归侨和侨眷的问题，给有关方面做参考。因为归侨和侨眷也有一些特点值得我们注意的：（一）华侨虽然是有着爱好劳动的优良传统，但是因为精壮的劳动力都在国外，留在家乡的，一般都是劳动力较差的老弱妇孺；（二）大多数华侨本身是住在国外资本主义的社会里，而家属是住在祖国社会主义改造的环境里，两个不同的社会制度的关系已经是错综复杂，而对改造过程的认识，也就不能一下子对他们要求得很高，这是很自然的。因此在农业合作化运动进行过程中，是应该注意到上述的特点，合理地安排和使用侨眷的劳动力，照顾他们的劳动习惯，而特别要注意依照自愿互利的原则，做好团结工作，才不会在运动中再出现偏差，而引起国外华侨的忧虑和不安。去年曾经一度在个别一些侨乡，因为干部没有好好地执行中央规定的侨务政策，对粮食的处理出现了很多的缺点，给国外侨胞引起了不必要的忧虑。我们应该对工作的未来多作“预见”，防患未然，如果在偏差出现之后再作检讨，但是已经招受了国家海外声誉的损失，那完全是不必要的。
    华侨是热爱祖国热爱家乡的，他们和家乡侨眷的关系是千丝万缕，他们经常接到亲人们“家书抵万金”的来信。从家信里倾听着亲人叙述解放后祖国各种建设的新气象，慰借了他们在遥远里渴念祖国的心情。也就是把家信里的内容作为对外宣传的资料。所以我们完全不能轻视侨眷家信对国外侨胞的影响，更不能轻视了一千多万散布在东南亚及其他各国的华侨对外的影响。因此，我们要极力做好国内的侨务工作，但是要做好侨务工作，单单靠着侨务机构，力量还是不够的，必须是全国人民和党政各有关部门认清华侨处境的特殊情况，大家一道通力合作，才会收到应有的效果。
    我这一次回国，不但出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议，同时在前几天还出席了中央华侨事务委员会召集的第四次全国侨务扩大会议，在扩大会议上我听了首长们和许多归侨代表、侨眷代表的报告，我体会到政府对侨务工作的关怀。我相信第四次侨务扩大会议闭幕后，对今后的侨务工作是会做得更好的。
      感谢伟大的祖国！
      感谢伟大的毛主席！
