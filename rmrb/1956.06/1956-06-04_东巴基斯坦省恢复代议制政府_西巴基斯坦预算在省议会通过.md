Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, June 2nd: Pakistani President Mirza rescinded the order he issued on May 26th, which suspended the constitution in East Pakistan and took over the administration of East Pakistan, on the evening of June 1st, and restored the representative government of East Pakistan.

Mirza took measures to suspend the constitution in East Pakistan after the Speaker of the East Pakistan Provincial Legislative Assembly announced his rejection of the provincial government's budget. After taking over the government of East Pakistan, Mirza approved the province's three-month budget from June 1st to August 31st.

The President's new order allows the United Front cabinet, headed by Sarkar, to return to power.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi: The West Pakistan Provincial Assembly passed the West Pakistan Province's 1955-56 budget on May 31st.

The Speaker (of the Republican Party, which is in power in West Pakistan Province) adopted a method of setting a voting date to prevent the opposition party from obstructing the parliament's passage of the budget's appropriation requests. Members of the opposition Muslim League walked out of the meeting to protest the Speaker's decision. Subsequently, the budget proposed by the provincial government was passed amidst enthusiastic cheers from Republican Party members.

The West Pakistan Provincial Assembly budget meeting opened on May 19th. The Muslim League, which until recently held a majority in the parliament, has been trying its best to overthrow the provincial government headed by Republican leader Sahib Khan. Before and during the meeting, both parties conducted intense political activities in order to gain the support of a majority of members in the provincial assembly. After the Muslim League failed to compete with the Republican Party for the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly on May 20th, some Muslim League members continued to switch and join the Republican Party.

    东巴基斯坦省恢复代议制政府  
    西巴基斯坦预算在省议会通过
    据新华社喀喇蚩2日讯　巴基斯坦总统米尔扎六月一日晚上取消了他在五月二十六日发布的停止在东巴基斯坦实行宪法和接管东巴基斯坦行政权的命令，并且恢复了东巴基斯坦的代议制政府。
    米尔扎是在东巴基斯坦省的立法会议议长宣布拒绝省政府的预算以后，采取停止在东巴基斯坦实行宪法的措施的。米尔扎在接管了东巴基斯坦政府以后，批准了这个省的从六月一日到八月三十一日为止的三个月的预算。
    总统的新的命令使得以萨卡尔为首的联合阵线内阁能够重新执政。
    据新华社喀喇蚩讯　西巴基斯坦省议会在五月三十一日通过了西巴基斯坦省1955—56年度的预算。
    议长（在西巴基斯坦省执政的共和党人）采取了规定表决日期的办法以防止反对党阻挠议会通过预算中的拨款要求。反对党回教联盟议员退出会场以抗议议长的决定。接着省政府提出的预算就在共和党议员的热烈欢呼声中被通过了。
    西巴基斯坦省议会预算会议是在五月十九日开幕的。不久以前还在议会中占多数的回教联盟竭力想推翻以共和党领袖萨希布汗为首的省政府。在会议举行前和会议期间，两党都进行了紧张的政治活动，以便在省议会当中取得多数议员的支持。在五月二十日回教联盟同共和党竞争省议会议长失败后，继续有一些回教联盟的议员转而加入了共和党。
