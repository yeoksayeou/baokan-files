Don't Think You Can Profit from the Chinese People

The Nansha Islands, Dongsha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Xisha Islands in the South China Sea have always been Chinese territory. This is a clear and undeniable fact for anyone. However, recently, some people have been making trouble out of nothing, attempting to provoke the Chinese people and brazenly infringing upon China's sovereignty over these islands. First, some people said that it seemed the Filipinos "discovered" some islands of the Nansha Islands, and therefore these islands "should" belong to the Philippines. Then, the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique came out and said that these islands "have always been a part of Vietnam." Then, Jacques Boissier, the French Chargé d'Affaires in the Philippines, declared that since France had occupied these islands in 1932-1933, they should belong to France. These adventurers seem to have discovered ownerless treasure islands, vying to declare themselves the "masters" of these islands. Thus, some people call this an "international dispute." However, it is clear at a glance that this is not an "international dispute," but an international conspiracy deliberately created to seize another country's territory!

Now, after a group of adventurers stirred up the waters of the South China Sea, the United States has entered the scene. According to the Associated Press, the United States seems to have been "drawn into" the vortex of this "international dispute." Recently, US Seventh Fleet Commander Ingersoll openly clamored that the United States "does not approve" of China's exercise of sovereignty over Nanwei Island in the Nansha Islands. US Naval Commander in the Philippines, Wendell Switzer, even threatened that the Seventh Fleet has a responsibility to take any action that should be taken under any circumstances.

With the open support of the United States, this so-called "international dispute" has recently escalated even further. The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique not only made "claims" to the Nansha Islands, but also said that it had "traditional sovereignty" over the Xisha Islands, and used the San Francisco Conference of September 1951 as a basis.

These sophistries are, of course, worthless. As early as the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Xisha Islands were already Chinese territory. In many ancient Chinese books, such as Fei Xin's "Xingcha Shenglan" and Huang Shengzeng's "Xiyang Chaogong Dianlu," there are detailed records of the Xisha Islands. In 1907, Li Zhun, Admiral of the Guangdong Navy of China, inspected the Xisha Islands with the navy and erected flags and inscribed stones as markers. During World War II, the Xisha Islands were occupied by Japan, but after Japan surrendered, these islands were returned to the then Chinese government on November 27, 1946. It can be seen that the South Vietnamese authorities' so-called "traditional sovereignty" over the Xisha Islands is completely fabricated.

As for the San Francisco Conference in September 1951, when drafting the one-sided peace treaty with Japan, the United States did deliberately stipulate only that Japan renounce its rights to Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands, without mentioning the return of these islands to China. But this is illegal. Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a statement on August 15, 1951, exposing the US conspiracy and reaffirming China's sovereignty over these islands. Now, someone is bringing up this matter of the San Francisco Conference again, which can only make people see more clearly the long-standing ambition of the United States.

Our government issued a solemn statement on May 29, stating that China's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands will never allow any country to infringe upon it under any pretext or in any way. Similarly, China's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands and other islands belonging to China will never allow infringement. These islands are the territory of China's 600 million people, and they are by no means a paradise for international adventurers! If anyone thinks they can pick up any advantages from the Chinese people, they will only end up in disgrace.

    别想从中国人民手里占便宜
    在南中国海上的南沙群岛、东沙群岛、中沙群岛和西沙群岛，一向是中国的领土。这是明明白白的事实，任何人也无法否认。可是近来竟有人无事生非，企图向中国人民进行挑衅，悍然要侵犯中国对这些岛屿的主权。首先，有人说，仿佛是菲律宾人“发现”了南沙群岛的一些岛屿，因此这些岛屿“理应”属于菲律宾。接着，南越吴庭艳集团也出来说，这些岛屿“一直是越南的一部分”。然后，法国驻菲律宾代办雅克·布瓦塞出来声明说，由于在1932—1933年法国曾经占领过这些岛屿，因此它们应该属于法国。这些冒险家们好像发现了没有主人的金银岛，争着想自封为这些岛屿的“主人”。于是有人就把这件事叫做“国际争执”。但是，一望而知，这并不是什么“国际争执”，而是故意制造出来的想要侵占别国领土的国际阴谋！
    现在，当一群冒险家把南中国海的水搅混了以后，美国就出场了。照合众社的说法，美国似乎是“被卷入”这个“国际争执”的漩涡中去的。最近，美国第七舰队司令英格索尔公然叫嚷说，美国“不赞成”中国行使对南沙群岛中的南威岛的主权。美国驻菲律宾海军司令温德尔·斯威策更威吓说：第七舰队，有责任采取在任何情况下应当采取的任何行动。
    在美国的公开支持下，这个所谓“国际争执”最近竟更加扩大了。南越吴庭艳集团不但对南沙群岛提出“要求”，而且说什么它对西沙群岛也有“传统的主权”，并且把1951年9月的旧金山会议作为根据。
    这些诡辩当然是一文不值的。还在十五世纪初期，西沙群岛就已经是中国的领土。在我国的许多古书中，例如费信的“星槎胜览”和黄省曾的“西洋朝贡典录”中，都有关于西沙群岛的详细记载。1907年，我国广东水师提督李准曾率海军视察了西沙群岛，并竖旗勒石以为标志。第二次世界大战中，西沙群岛被日本占领过，但是日本投降后，这些岛屿就于1946年11月27日归还当时的中国政府了。由此可见，南越当局所谓对西沙群岛的“传统主权”，完全是捏造的。
    至于在1951年9月的旧金山会议上，在制定片面的对日和约草案的时候，美国的确故意仅仅规定日本放弃对南威岛和西沙群岛的权利，而不提这些岛屿归还中国的问题。但是这是非法的。我国周恩来外长在1951年8月15日已经发表声明，揭露了美国的阴谋，并重申中国对这些岛屿的主权。现在有人重新提起旧金山会议的这一件事，只能使人更清楚地看到美国蓄谋已久的野心而已。
    我国政府已于五月二十九日严正声明，中国对南沙群岛的主权，绝不容许任何国家用任何借口和采取任何方式加以侵犯。同样的，中国对西沙群岛和其他属于中国的岛屿的主权，也绝不容许侵犯。这些岛屿是中国六亿人民的领土，它们决不是国际冒险家的乐园！如果有人以为从中国人民手里可以拣到什么便宜，他们只会得到身败名裂的下场。
