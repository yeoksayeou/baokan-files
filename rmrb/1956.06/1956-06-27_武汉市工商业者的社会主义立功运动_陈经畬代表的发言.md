The Socialist Meritorious Service Campaign of Wuhan Industrialists and Businessmen
——Speech by Representative Chen Jingyu

    After listening to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Speech on the Implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy in Our Country," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Draft Model Charter for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," and the speeches of other responsible comrades from the Central Government, I felt extremely excited. These reports and speeches fully demonstrate that our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation have achieved new and great victories, and that our country is advancing by leaps and bounds towards a prosperous and happy socialist society. I wholeheartedly express my warm support.

    Vice Premier Chen Yun's opinions on the "Socialist Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce" have provided reasonable solutions to some of the problems currently existing in the industrial and commercial sectors, making industrialists and businessmen more willing to further accept socialist transformation. This is an encouraging and happy event, and I express my infinite gratitude.

    Since the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce entered a high tide, encouraged and promoted by the socialist emulation campaign among the staff and workers, industrialists and businessmen in Hubei Province and Wuhan City have enthusiastically responded to the call for socialist emulation and launched a campaign to perform meritorious service for socialism. This is the beginning of a deeper transformation of enterprises and individuals, and it represents the determination of industrialists and businessmen to wholeheartedly embark on the path of socialism. Now, I will report on the development of the meritorious service campaign.

    The meritorious service campaign was first launched in Wuhan City, initiated by private personnel of the Wuhan Agricultural Machinery Plant, a joint state-private enterprise, on February 29th, who proposed to all private personnel of joint state-private factories in Wuhan to strive for meritorious service in socialist transformation. It is now being promoted throughout the province. Private personnel of the Wuhan Agricultural Machinery Plant, such as Dou Quangen, realized after the establishment of the joint state-private enterprise that they had embarked on the road of socialism, which was extremely fortunate. Therefore, they used their wisdom, actively worked, and creatively improved production tools. In February, he was honorably invited to attend the Wuhan City Third Labor Model Conference, which greatly encouraged all private personnel in the factory to serve socialism, and he proposed ten meritorious service initiatives. In early March, private personnel in the machinery and electrical industries were the first to respond enthusiastically. Subsequently, the department store, silk and cloth, and printing industries in the Jianghan District also put forward meritorious service initiatives, which were enthusiastically supported by private personnel in various industries throughout the district. The meritorious service campaign has promoted private personnel to formulate personal meritorious service plans, participate in socialist emulation with the staff and workers, and achieve significant results.

    In the first quarter's socialist emulation evaluation, a total of 367 private personnel in Wuhan City received material rewards and commendations. Among them, 164 were in the industrial sector and 203 were in the commercial sector. There were 14 first-class awards, 68 second-class awards, 196 third-class awards, 6 fourth-class awards, 2 honorary awards, and 81 people were commended. It is estimated that more advanced producers and advanced workers will emerge from the industrial and commercial sectors in the second quarter's socialist emulation evaluation. Currently, the Hubei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce are summarizing the preliminary experience of Wuhan City and formulating plans to promote the campaign throughout the province in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    The main contents of the meritorious service initiative are: to obey the leadership of the state representatives, be responsible and conscientious; break down conservative thinking, support rationalization proposals; improve production technology, improve product quality, save raw materials, reduce costs, and ensure the early and over-fulfillment of production tasks; improve service attitudes and business practices, eliminate errors, reduce expenses, and ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of sales plans; strengthen learning, transform thinking, and improve cultural, theoretical, technical, and business levels to better serve socialist construction.

    The main purposes of the meritorious service initiative are: 1. To promote private personnel to actively participate in the production upsurge and socialist emulation, improve ideological awareness through work practice, cultivate labor skills, develop labor habits, overcome capitalist business management practices, and learn socialist business management methods, in order to prepare for abandoning exploitation, welcoming the nationalization of the means of production, and becoming self-reliant laborers; 2. To strengthen the patriotism and collectivism of private personnel, love socialism, and thus actively and proactively contribute all their strength to strive for meritorious service for the socialist construction of the motherland.

    According to the materials currently available, the main roles played by the meritorious service campaign are: 1. To promote private personnel to actively participate in socialist emulation together with staff and workers; 2. To strengthen the sense of responsibility of private personnel for the production and operation of enterprises; 3. To change the views of staff and workers towards private personnel; 4. To improve the relationship between private personnel; 5. To improve the socialist consciousness of private personnel. These positive effects are in line with the purpose and requirements of this movement. Therefore, we believe that carrying out the meritorious service campaign is indeed of great significance for private personnel to further accept socialist transformation, and it points out the correct direction of effort for private personnel.

    In order to actively promote and develop this campaign, the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Federations of Industry and Commerce will, under the leadership of the Hubei Provincial Committee and Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial and Municipal People's Committees, strive for the assistance and cooperation of the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Federations of Trade Unions, the Wuhan Municipal Democratic National Construction Association, and other relevant organs and organizations, mobilize private personnel throughout the province and city to actively participate in this campaign, and make this campaign develop universally, comprehensively, and deeply. However, this is a new task, and we have no experience. Therefore, we will adopt the method of carrying it out while exploring, constantly summarizing experience, and gradually improving and upgrading it.

    Fellow representatives: Chairman Mao instructed us: "In about three years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed nationwide." This gives the people of the whole country great encouragement, and we in the industrial and commercial sectors feel even more inspired. In today's rapid development of socialist construction, we industrialists and businessmen must work more actively, perform meritorious service for socialism, and strengthen our learning and transformation of our thinking, so that we can transform ourselves from exploiters into self-reliant laborers. We have the confidence and determination to complete our transformation tasks. The policy of peaceful transformation adopted by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao towards private industry and commerce is a beacon of light and a source of happiness for industrialists and businessmen. We should unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the early and over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan, and to strive for new and greater victories in socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    武汉市工商业者的社会主义立功运动
    ——陈经畬代表的发言
    我听了李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”、李富春副总理“关于我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划的执行情况的发言”、廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”以及中央其他负责同志的发言，使我感到万分兴奋。这些报告和发言，充分表明了我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业获得了新的巨大的胜利，表明了我国正一日千里地向着繁荣幸福的社会主义社会突飞猛进。我衷心表示热烈的拥护。
    陈云副总理关于“私营工商业的社会主义改造问题”的意见，对工商界目前存在的一些问题，都给以合理的处理，使工商业者更加愉快地进一步接受社会主义改造，这是令人欢欣鼓舞的一件好事，我表示无限的感谢。
      自私营工商业的社会主义改造进入高潮以后，在职工群众开展社会主义竞赛的鼓舞和推动之下，湖北省和武汉市的工商业者都热烈响应社会主义竞赛的号召，并开展了为社会主义立功的运动。这是企业改造和个人改造进一步深入的开始，是工商业者满腔热情地奔赴社会主义的决心的表示。现在我报告一下立功运动的发展情况。
    立功运动是由公私合营武汉农业药械厂私方人员，在今年2月29日向武汉全市公私合营工厂私方人员提出的在社会主义改造中争取立功的倡议而首先在武汉市开展起来的，现正在向全省推广。公私合营武汉农业药械厂私方人员都全根，在企业公私合营以后，认识到自己走上了社会主义的道路，是极大的幸运，因而发挥智慧，积极劳动，创造性地改进生产工具。二月间，他光荣地被邀列席武汉市第三届劳动模范大会，大大地鼓舞了该厂全体私方人员为社会主义服务的积极性，提出了十项立功倡议。三月初，机器、电机两个行业的私方人员首先热烈响应，接着江汉区的百货业、绸布业和印制业，也提出了立功倡议，并得到全区各业私方人员的热烈响应。立功运动推动了私方人员订立了个人立功的规划，与职工群众一起投入了社会主义竞赛，并取得了显著的成绩。
    在第一季度社会主义竞赛的评比中，全武汉市私方人员得到物质奖励和表扬的共有367人。其中工业方面有164人，商业方面有203人。获得甲等奖的有14人，乙等奖的有68人，丙等奖的有196人，丁等奖的有6人，另有2人得到荣誉奖，81人得到表扬。估计在第二季度的社会主义竞赛评比中，工商界将会涌现出更多的先进生产者和先进工作者。目前，湖北省工商联和武汉市工商联正在总结武汉市的初步经验，制订规划，将有计划、有步骤地进行全省推广。
    立功倡议的主要内容是：服从公方领导，守职尽责；打破保守思想，支持合理化建议；改进生产技术，提高产品质量，节约原材料，降低成本，保证生产任务提前和超额完成；改善服务态度和经营作风，消灭差错，降低费用开支，保证完成和超额完成销售计划；加强学习，改造思想，提高文化、理论和技术、业务水平，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    立功倡议的主要目的是：一、推动私方人员积极投入生产高潮，参加社会主义竞赛，通过工作实践，提高思想觉悟，培养劳动技能，养成劳动习惯，克服资本主义的经营管理作风，学会社会主义的经营管理方法，为放弃剥削、迎接生产资料国有化，使自己成为自食其力的劳动者作好准备；二、加强私方人员的爱国主义思想和集体主义思想，热爱社会主义，从而主动地积极地贡献自己的一切力量，争取为祖国的社会主义建设立功。
    根据目前掌握的材料看来，立功运动所起的作用，主要有以下几个方面：一、推动私方人员和职工群众一道积极参加社会主义竞赛；二、加强私方人员对企业生产经营的责任感；三、改变了职工群众对私方人员的观感；四、改善了私方人员相互间的关系；五、提高了私方人员的社会主义觉悟。这些良好作用，是符合这个运动的目的和要求的。因此，我们认为开展立功运动，对私方人员进一步接受社会主义改造的确具有重要意义，它给私方人员指出了正确的努力方向。
    为了积极推广和发展这个运动，湖北省和武汉市工商业联合会将在中国共产党湖北省委和武汉市委与省、市人民委员会的领导下，争取中国人民政治协商会议湖北省和武汉市委员会、湖北省和武汉市工会联合会、武汉市民主建国会及其他有关机关、团体的协助配合，动员全省和全市私方人员积极投入这个运动，使这个运动普遍地、全面地、深入地开展起来。但是，这是一项新的工作，我们还没有经验，因此，我们采取边开展，边摸索，不断总结经验，逐步改进，逐步提高的办法来进行。
    各位代表：毛主席指示我们：“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成”。这给全国人民以极大的鼓舞，我们工商界更感到无比的感奋。在社会主义建设事业突飞猛进的今天，我们工商业者更要积极工作，为社会主义立功，更要加强学习，改造思想，使自己由剥削者成为自食其力的劳动者。我们有信心、有决心来完成自己的改造任务。中国共产党和毛主席对私营工商业所采取的和平改造政策，是工商业者的光明灯塔和幸福源泉，我们应该更紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，和全国人民一道，为争取五年计划提前完成和超额完成而奋斗，为争取社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业取得新的更大的胜利而奋斗。
