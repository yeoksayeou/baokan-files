    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: Polish Press Agency reported: Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan, in an academic lecture on "The United Nations" to the faculty and students of Jagiellonian University in Krakow on June 13th, said that the United Nations organization is a symbol of the world's growing unity, but there are three obstacles on the road to unity: First, the United Nations lacks universality, especially the absence of China in this organization. This makes it necessary to discuss many important issues outside the organization; and these issues cannot be resolved without China's participation. Second, the formation of blocs, which makes important issues considered not according to the principles of the United Nations Charter, but according to their impact on the Cold War policy. Third, the United Nations has not taken the necessary attitude towards colonialism, which was declared against at the Bandung Conference.
    Radhakrishnan said that if these three obstacles are eliminated, the United Nations will transform itself from a symbol of world unity into a true expression of this unity.

    印度副总统到达莫斯科访问
    在波兰时呼吁联合国消除三个障碍以团结世界
    据新华社讯　印度副总统拉德哈克里希南在十五日下午离开华沙到达莫斯科。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席塔拉索夫、苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇、萨布罗夫、副主席马林科夫等到机场欢迎。
    今天的苏联“真理报”、“消息报”、“红星报”都刊登了拉德哈克里希南的照片和简历，表示对这位印度贵宾的欢迎。
    据新华社华沙讯　波兰通讯社报道：印度副总统拉德哈克里希南在六月十三日在对克拉科夫的雅吉隆大学的师生作关于“联合国”的学术讲演的时候说，联合国组织是世界日益增长的团结的象征，但是在团结的道路上有三个障碍：首先，联合国缺乏普遍性，特别是这个组织中没有中国参加。这就使得许多重要问题必须在这个组织以外讨论；而这些问题如果没有中国参加是不能够解决的。其次是集团的成立，这使得重要的问题不是按照联合国宪章的原则、而是按照它们对冷战政策的影响如何来加以审议。第三，联合国没有对殖民主义采取应有的态度，而殖民主义是在万隆会议上被宣布反对的。
    拉德哈克里希南说，如果消除了这三种障碍，联合国就会把自己从世界团结的象征，转变成为这种团结的真正表现。
