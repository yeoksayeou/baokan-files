Based on the guidelines of last year's National Conference on Cultural and Educational Work, the central task of higher education work over the past year has been to improve quality and implement the educational policy of all-round development. Significant achievements have been made in improving the quality of new students, consolidating the student body, overcoming students' excessive academic burden, improving students' health, strengthening the connection between theory and practice, improving teaching, and carrying out scientific research. In particular, since the second half of last year, inspired by the upsurge of national socialist construction and socialist transformation, the vast number of teachers and students have enthusiastically responded to the call to march towards science. Teachers have universally formulated long-term plans for personal improvement, teaching improvement, and scientific research, and schools everywhere are showing vigorous vitality.

In 1955, more than 4,000 people were enrolled in excess of the plan while ensuring quality; the number of students in higher education institutions across the country reached more than 292,400, an increase of 13% compared to 1954; in 1955, a total of more than 56,000 students graduated from higher education institutions, an increase of 18% compared to 1954; night schools and correspondence departments enrolled more than 8,400 people, with nearly 16,000 students enrolled; 2,093 students were sent to study abroad.

In 1955, 7 new higher education institutions were added, and one was adjusted and merged, so there are now 194 higher education institutions in the country. Some engineering, comprehensive universities, and a very small number of agricultural, medical, and foreign language colleges have extended their schooling by one year. Specialized courses in engineering and science have basically stopped enrolling students and are no longer being offered.

The rapid development of the national socialist economic construction and cultural construction, and the task of striving to bring the most urgently needed scientific departments close to the world's advanced level within 12 years (i.e., by the end of the third five-year plan), have placed greater and higher demands on higher education work. The general requirements are: to actively expand the number of cadres trained, while ensuring a certain quality, especially striving to have more graduates during the second five-year plan. It is necessary to actively create conditions to set up or strengthen as soon as possible those majors that are urgently needed by the country but are currently "missing" in our country or whose foundations are still weak; it is necessary to further improve the quality of teaching, actively carry out scientific research work, strengthen students' political and ideological education, and improve students' health. It is also necessary to take various measures to vigorously train worker-peasant cadres, minority nationality cadres, and returned overseas Chinese cadres. At the same time, actively and step by step carry out night school and correspondence education to improve the scientific and technological level and professional ability of on-the-job employees. This is the arduous task for our higher education workers in the future.

Now I will briefly explain several major issues in higher education work and put forward our opinions.

\
I

Regarding the expansion of existing schools and the location of new schools - the sources of teachers and students in higher education institutions must be guaranteed

According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on "overall planning and strengthening leadership," we have been exploring for half a year to make preliminary plans for the task of training cadres in the next 12 years, and have made preliminary studies on how to improve the quality of teaching, carry out scientific research work, and strengthen leadership.

According to the requirements of the central departments for cadres, it is estimated that in the next 12 years, higher education institutions will need to enroll more than 3 million to 4 million students, and need to add more than 300 new schools.

For 1956, the national higher education institutions have set the enrollment target at 163,000, and the number of students will reach more than 380,000, an increase of 32% compared to 1955, not including the enrollment of 53,000 in spare-time higher education institutions. In addition, in 1956, 600 four-year regular graduate students and more than 2,200 two-year graduate students (excluding normal schools) will be recruited, and more than 2,100 students will be sent to study abroad. The speed of development is very fast. It is expected that after the summer enrollment in 1957, according to the current enrollment target, the number of students in higher education institutions can reach more than 510,000, exceeding the first five-year plan target by about 19%.

From the current subjective strength of higher education institutions, this enrollment target and the number of new schools are already very large, and ensuring a certain quality is already quite difficult, and recently various parties are constantly putting forward new requirements. Under these circumstances, we believe that it is very necessary to further verify needs, understand the reasonable ratio of senior to intermediate and various types of majors, and fully estimate possible conditions and make proper arrangements.

Regarding the expansion of existing schools and the location of new schools, in the future, we should combine the economic development layout with the potential of the original schools and make appropriate considerations in the overall plan. Regarding "missing" and weak majors, we should, in conjunction with the Academy of Sciences, actively create conditions and strive to set up and strengthen them in batches according to urgency in three or four years, based on the principle of grasping key points and ensuring urgent needs.

In order to strive for more graduates during the second five-year plan to meet the urgent needs of national construction, the original plan to change the school system and extend the length of study, which was originally planned last year, had to be appropriately postponed in some schools. In the future, the change of school system must be gradually implemented on the premise of not excessively affecting the cadre training plan. At the same time, in order to meet the requirements for the quality of cadres during the second five-year plan and enable higher education institutions to concentrate their efforts on running more and better undergraduate programs, in the future, except for normal schools, specialized courses in other majors will generally no longer be set up, unless there is an urgent need, and special classes will be run by secondary vocational schools instead.

The State Council has organized a cadre training planning group to study these issues. Once determined, we will strive to create conditions to complete them.

To rapidly expand the number of cadres trained and ensure a certain quality, the biggest difficulty from the current conditions is the shortage of teachers, which must be vigorously supplemented and improved. Especially in the past few years, the need for teachers is the most urgent, and the contradiction with the needs of national construction departments and scientific research institutions is also the greatest. We believe that in order to cultivate a reserve force of construction cadres and scientific strength, it is very necessary for all parties to vigorously support higher education institutions to retain graduates with better quality as "laying hens." Otherwise, students will be enrolled, but there will be no one to teach them, let alone actively carry out scientific research and improve the quality of teaching.

The source of students will also be very difficult in the next four or five years. In addition to expanding high school enrollment, it is also necessary to take measures to mobilize some on-the-job cadres, primary school teachers, and secondary vocational school graduates to apply for the exam. This will have a certain impact on the work of various departments, but for the long-term interests of the country, we hope that all parties will provide support and assistance.

In short, to complete the task of training cadres in higher education institutions, the source and quality of teachers and students must be guaranteed, just as factories must guarantee the supply of workers and raw materials to manufacture products.

The leadership relationship of higher education institutions should be divided according to the nature of the schools - the powers of presidents and deans should be appropriately expanded

In order to smoothly realize the arduous development tasks of higher education in the future, it is also necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties to jointly run the schools well. The existing institutional system, planning system, financial system, leadership relationship, and the system of unified distribution of all graduates of higher education institutions, etc., excessively emphasize centralization and unity, affecting and restricting the enthusiasm of various business departments and localities in running higher education, and should be appropriately changed. We believe that the leadership relationship of higher education institutions should be divided according to the nature of the schools: higher education institutions that mainly train cadres for local construction undertakings should be directly led by the local government; higher education institutions that mainly train cadres for the undertakings of various central business departments or a national construction undertaking, except for comprehensive universities, multi-disciplinary specialized colleges related to several business departments, and individual single-discipline specialized colleges, which are directly led by the Ministry of Higher Education, the rest should be directly led by the relevant central business departments. The division of labor in leadership should be: for schools led by various central business departments or localities, the Ministry of Higher Education should inspect, guide, and supervise the principles, policies, and teaching business, formulate and approve unified rules and regulations and teaching documents, plan to train and dispatch teachers, and assist the State Planning Commission in considering the establishment of new schools and majors and balancing career plans; the rest, such as the leadership of daily teaching work, the replenishment of teachers, basic construction, teaching equipment, personnel establishment, financial reporting, etc., should be directly responsible by the competent department or the local government to the relevant central departments; the distribution of graduates should also be appropriately changed in the spirit of being conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of various departments and localities.

The powers of presidents and deans should be appropriately expanded. In the past, we were right to actively implement the policy of streamlining and saving in basic construction, financial reporting system, and staffing, but some aspects inevitably restricted too tightly and rigidly, making it difficult for schools to have room for flexible adaptation, and there were similar situations in other regulations, which hindered the work of the schools to varying degrees. Over the past few years, the administrative and teaching work of the schools have gradually been on the right track and have accumulated some experience, they should have more flexible powers, which is beneficial.

Cultivate students' independent thinking and working ability - improve teaching system, content and methods to gradually improve teaching effectiveness - vigorously change the style of schools engaging in movements

Cultivating students' independent thinking and working ability and overcoming the phenomenon of students' excessive academic and life tension are urgent problems to be solved.

In the first half of last year, many higher education institutions had the phenomenon of students' excessive academic burden. After the National Conference on Cultural and Educational Work, various schools took measures to revise teaching plans, strengthen teaching methods, and balance students' assignments. The learning situation has improved. Although it is still tense, it is not as chaotic as before. However, in recent months, many schools have reported that students do not have enough time for extracurricular self-study, and do not have ample time to digest and master the theories and technologies they have learned, while at the same time students' learning and life have been overly tense. Most students cannot get complete rest on Sundays and generally have to study for half a day. According to our ministry, the proportion of students who failed the exams last semester has increased in many schools. Although the number of students suffering from tuberculosis and digestive diseases has decreased, the number of students suffering from neurasthenia and high blood pressure has generally not decreased, and some schools have even increased. This situation should arouse our serious attention.

What are the reasons for this situation? The academic burden of some majors is still somewhat heavy, some teachers' teaching methods are not good enough, and many students still have problems with their learning methods. These will be part of the reason and need to be studied and improved. However, for many schools, the most prominent problem is that there are too many and too chaotic extracurricular activities, which affect students' normal learning, thus causing students' learning and life to be overly tense. This must be grasped and resolved.

Higher education students should participate in certain extracurricular activities and social activities in order to enrich their lives, expand their horizons, and help improve their health. However, too many and chaotic activities, regardless of students' learning and rest, regardless of conditions, and forced uniformity will not only affect teaching order and create tension and chaos, but also affect health. For example, promoting labor and health system exercises and carrying out sports activities are beneficial and necessary for improving students' health and have indeed achieved the effect of improving health; however, if we lack preparation when implementing them, do not cooperate with necessary conditions such as medical supervision, and require uniformity regardless of the situation, and even occupy too much time, it will hinder learning and affect health. For example, participating in voluntary labor is good for cultivating students' labor viewpoints, but too many times or too far away, affecting students' normal rest, will also affect normal learning. Some also require students to contract to eliminate illiteracy and catch rats and sparrows, which will further increase students' burden. For example, developing students' science groups is originally to cultivate students' research interests and exercise students' research abilities, but if we ignore students' conditions and bloom everywhere, some students will spend a lot of time and delay the learning of basic theory courses to engage in research work beyond their capabilities. The party and youth league reports in some schools have also increased. The "class triangle" (class leader, class chairman, and youth league branch secretary) is particularly busy and manages too wide a range of affairs. Some even have to do the work of evaluating scholarships and managing meals. Under the "class triangle", many cadres have to be set up. Some classes have set up more than 20 cadres. With so many activities and work squeezed together, there will inevitably be too many meetings, especially "student cadres" who hold positions among students, and their time and energy are not enough to allocate.

Because many leaders of our higher education institutions are accustomed to engaging in the style of movements, and at the same time the vast number of young people are inevitably enthusiastic and eager to achieve success, under the inspiration of the upsurge of national socialist construction, the style of promoting work by engaging in movements has developed again. Many schools have also inappropriately emphasized collective activities, creating mass pressure, making every student have to compete in all subjects, in various extracurricular activities, and even in various cultural and recreational activities, striving for collective honor, and thus essentially carrying out competitions between classes in learning and in all activities. Student learning is a kind of arduous and gradual mental work. The responsibility of the school lies in continuously improving the teaching system, content, and methods to gradually improve the teaching effect, rather than relying on engaging in movements and competitions to promote teaching work, attempting to achieve quick success. Making generalized and egalitarian demands on students of different levels and different interests in learning and political and ideological education, and even in social activities, and making every student follow suit under collective pressure, nervously and urgently, this practice is obviously harmful.

Some comrades one-sidedly understand the educational policy of "all-round development" and "three goods," understanding "all-round development" as "average development," ignoring the different situations of students, and demanding that they make equal progress in all subjects, demanding that every student learn from excellent students in everything, and demanding that the whole class become a model class, demanding too much and managing too tightly; this not only obliterates the students' personality and characteristics, but also inevitably leads to excessive academic burden and overly tense life. "All-round development" and "three goods" are to enable students' physical, political, and professional knowledge to be developed to a certain extent according to their individual circumstances, and at the same time to combine them with "teaching according to their aptitude" and "giving play to their strengths," and not to ignore students' personality and hobbies.

Because of the emphasis on collectivity and simultaneous progress in all activities, the students' social activities must be uniformly arranged, and the time and content of self-study must also be uniformly arranged. This, in addition to creating tension, also aggravates the shortcomings of our students' mechanical and rigid study and life that have always existed. Students have very little time to freely engage in activities of their personal specialties, which also affects their ability to work independently.

Vigorously changing the style of schools engaging in movements, overcoming students' excessive academic and life tension, changing students' mechanical and rigid lives, enabling students to have more free time to digest and consolidate the knowledge and skills they have learned, and reasonably give play to their hobbies and specialties, exercise and cultivate students' independent working ability, this is a key issue in improving the quality of training cadres, which must be immediately addressed and resolved. In the past, not enough attention was paid to the work of cultivating students' independent thinking ability, and the Ministry of Higher Education is responsible for this in leadership.

IV

How to solve the contradiction between teaching tasks and scientific research

Regarding the issue of higher education institutions cooperating with the Academy of Sciences and various business departments to carry out scientific research work.

The basic task of higher education institutions is to train senior construction talents and scientific reserve forces who have mastered the modern scientific and technological level for the national socialist construction cause; at the same time, in order to promote the development of the construction cause and continuously improve the quality of teaching, teachers in higher education institutions must also carry out scientific research work. The scientific strength in higher education institutions accounts for a large part of the national scientific strength. In order to strive to bring the most urgently needed scientific departments in our country close to the world's advanced level within 12 years, higher education institutions, in addition to actively completing the task of training cadres, also bear great responsibility in scientific research. In order to improve the scientific level of higher education institutions and make significant contributions to the national construction cause and the training of experts, higher education institutions must have a group of teachers with high academic level to guide important scientific research work and train a large number of doctoral and associate doctoral students and graduate students.

At present, the Academy of Sciences and various departments are all considering how to add new or expand existing scientific research institutions in conjunction with the compilation of a 12-year scientific research plan, and therefore it is inevitable to consider transferring teachers with higher levels from higher education institutions to strengthen the scientific strength of their departments. However, if the already very tight teaching staff of higher education institutions is weakened, especially if the level of teachers in higher education institutions is lowered, it will also weaken the strength of training scientific cadres and technical cadres. From a long-term perspective, this is not conducive to training cadres and developing scientific research. At present, the "missing" or weak links in scientific research institutions are generally the "missing" or weak links in higher education. If these "missing" and weak majors are not set up and strengthened first, and scientific cadres in this area are trained, scientific research work will be difficult to carry out. This is a contradiction in the current allocation and use of scientific strength.

It should be admitted that the teaching tasks of teachers in higher education institutions are very heavy at present, and actively carrying out scientific research work in the future will inevitably produce certain contradictions in the arrangement of time and the use of strength.

How to appropriately alleviate these contradictions? We believe that the following specific measures can be taken:

First, the Academy of Sciences should focus on major scientific issues related to the national lifeline and large-scale comprehensive research work, and at the same time uniformly guide scientific research work in all aspects of the country. The research on technical issues directly related to production should mainly be undertaken by the research institutions of the business departments. Higher education institutions should, under the overall guidance of the Academy of Sciences, according to the requirements of the national overall research work and cadre training work, and according to the type of school and the specialties of teachers, share part of the theoretical research work carried out by the Academy of Sciences, accept the commissions of various departments, share part of the research tasks on technical problems and practical problems; and carry out scientific research work according to the needs of higher education institutions themselves.

Second, under the current circumstances, we suggest that the new research institutions established by the Academy of Sciences and business departments should be combined with relevant higher education institutions as much as possible and set up together. This will not only facilitate the teachers of higher education institutions and the researchers of the research institutes to hold concurrent positions, which is conducive to carrying out scientific research and training cadres, but also facilitate the mutual use of books, materials, and equipment, saving national investment. It is best to combine them with relevant teaching and research groups in higher education institutions in the early stage and use the strength of teachers in higher education institutions to set up relevant scientific research laboratories in higher education institutions. These research laboratories are led by higher education institutions, accept the tasks assigned by the Academy of Sciences and business departments, and accept their business guidance. In addition to using the personnel and teaching equipment of the schools, the relevant agencies invest in other necessary equipment, bear the necessary research expenses, and supplement the insufficient personnel. This is to make higher education institutions the grassroots organizations or distribution networks of scientific work in all aspects in scientific research, which can take into account both teaching and the national scientific research tasks, and reduce contradictions.

Third, the task of training graduate students and doctoral students should be uniformly arranged by the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education under the guidance of the national unified plan, and a unified training plan should be jointly formulated; in the recruitment and training work, they should also cooperate with each other in order to rationally use the strength of the tutors.

Fourth, the Ministry of Higher Education and various higher education institutions should vigorously implement the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on the issue of intellectuals, improve the living and working conditions of teachers, and resolutely ensure that they have five-sixths of their time per week for business work. For teachers who have made significant achievements in scientific research, reduce their administrative work, equip them with assistants, and reduce their teaching tasks when necessary; necessary teaching assistants should be added to the teaching and research groups (our ministry is working hard to solve this); these are important conditions for enabling teachers to spend more time improving teaching work, carrying out scientific research, and improving themselves.

Since the CPC Central Committee convened the meeting on the issue of intellectuals, various schools have done some work in improving the living conditions of teachers, but some problems, such as housing problems, still need to be solved step by step. As Comrade Xian Ying just said, the current health of teachers is not good and is deeply worrying, and sports and medical facilities need to be improved urgently. In terms of improving the working conditions of teachers, various schools have also taken some measures, but there are still many problems with the purchase of books, materials, and experimental equipment that teachers urgently need. The suggestions made by Comrade Sun Xiaocun in his speech just now will be further worked on and resolved by our ministry in conjunction with the relevant departments and schools, and we hope that the relevant departments will vigorously support the purchase of foreign books and scientific equipment. In terms of ensuring time for business work, most teachers are quite satisfied, but some teachers still have too many social activities and meetings, and the situation of holding concurrent positions has rarely improved, and these teachers are precisely the backbone of scientific forces, so it is worth paying special attention to and needs to be further resolved through the joint efforts of all parties.

We believe that taking the above-mentioned cooperation methods in all aspects can avoid neglecting one thing while attending to another in both training cadres and carrying out scientific research work; through the active efforts of higher education institutions to improve the living and working conditions of teachers, it will more powerfully strengthen the scientific research strength and cadre training strength of higher education institutions. Therefore, we believe that this may be a better path for allocating and using scientific strength and effectively carrying out scientific research work in all aspects at present.

Please review and correct whether the above is appropriate.

Due to the poor foundation of higher education in our country and our insufficient efforts, there are many shortcomings in our work, which are far behind the requirements of the development of the objective situation. In order to catch up with the requirements of the new situation, rapidly and as much as possible expand the number of cadres trained and strive to improve the quality of cadres trained, we must pay attention to combining the specific conditions of China to better learn from the advanced experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, and creatively apply them; to more effectively play the role of Soviet experts and fully play the strength of domestic experts, improve teaching and carry out scientific research work; at the same time, we must also pay attention to learning from the advanced experience of various people's democratic countries, critically absorb the excellent experience and scientific and technological specialties of all other countries, implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," activate the academic atmosphere, and promote the cultural heritage of our country. In the past, the leadership work of the Ministry of Higher Education had serious shortcomings in these aspects, and we will pay attention to correcting them in the future. We believe that under the strengthened leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, with the strong assistance and support of relevant departments and various provinces and cities and other relevant parties, giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all higher education workers, and working together, the higher education cause in our country will surely advance victoriously.

    高等教育部长杨秀峰的发言
    根据去年全国文教工作会议的方针，一年以来，高等教育工作以提高质量、贯彻全面发展的教育方针为中心任务。在提高入学新生质量、整顿在校学生队伍、克服学生学习负担过重、增进学生健康、加强理论同实际的联系、改进教学和开展科学研究等工作方面都取得了不少的成就。特别是从去年下半年以来，在国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造高潮的鼓舞下，广大师生热烈响应了向科学进军的号召，教师们普遍订立了个人进修提高、改进教学和进行科学研究的长期计划，学校到处呈现着蓬蓬勃勃的朝气。
    1955年招生在保证质量的条件下超额录取了4，000余人；全国高等学校在校学生达到292，400余人，比较1954年增加了13％；1955年高等学校毕业学生共计56，000余人，比较1954年增加了18％；夜校和函授部共招生8，400余人，在校学生将近16，000人；派出留学生2，093人。
    1955年增加了高等学校7所，调整合并一所，现在全国共有高等学校194所。部分工科、综合大学和极少数农科、医科、外国语院校，延长了学制一年。工科、理科各专业的专修科已基本上停止招生，不再办了。
    国家社会主义经济建设、文化建设突飞猛进的发展和力求最急需的科学部门能够在12年内（即第三个五年计划末）接近世界先进水平的任务，对高等教育工作提出了更大更高的要求。总的要求是：积极地扩大培养干部的数量，同时保证一定的质量，特别是争取在第二个五年计划期间多有一些毕业生。必须积极创造条件，把为国家所迫切需要而目前在我国还是“缺门”的或者是基础还薄弱的专业，尽快地设置或加强起来；必须进一步提高教学质量，积极开展科学研究工作，加强学生的政治思想教育和增进学生健康的工作。还必须采取种种办法，来大力培养工农干部、少数民族干部和回国华侨干部。同时，积极而有步骤地开展夜校和函授教育，以提高在职职工的科学技术水平和业务能力。这就是我们高等教育工作者今后的艰巨任务。
    现在我就高等教育工作几个主要问题扼要说明，并提出我们的意见。
                              一
    关于现有学校的扩建和新校的设置地点问题——高等学校师资、学生的来源必须保证
    根据党中央和国务院“全面规划、加强领导”的指示，半年以来曾摸索着对今后12年培养干部任务作了初步规划，对提高教学质量和开展科学研究工作以及加强领导的办法作了初步研究。
    根据中央各部门几次提出关于干部的要求，估计在今后12年内，高等学校需要招生300多万至400万，需要增设300多所新校。
    就1956年来说，已定全国高等学校招生任务为163，000人，在校学生将达到38万多人，比较1955年将增长32％，业余高等学校招生53，000人还不在内。此外，1956年将招考四年制正规研究生600人，二年制研究生2，200余人（不包括师范），派遣出国留学生2，100余人。发展速度都是很快的。预计到1957年暑期招生后，按照目前所定的招生任务，高等学校的在校学生可以达到51万多人，将超额完成第一个五年计划指标的19％左右。
    从现在高等学校主观力量来看，这个招生任务和新校数字已经很大了，保证一定质量已经有不小的困难，而最近各方面还在不断提出新的要求。在这种情况下，我们以为，进一步核实需要，摸清高级的同中级的以及各类专业之间的合理的培养干部比例，并充分估计到可能条件，作妥当的安排，是非常必要的。
    关于现有学校的扩建和新校的设置地点问题，今后应该根据经济发展布局和发挥原有学校潜力相结合的方针，在全面规划中进行适当考虑。关于“缺门”和薄弱专业，应该根据掌握重点、保证急需的原则，会同科学院，积极创造条件，争取在三、四年内，分别缓急，陆续设置与加强起来。
    由于争取在第二个五年计划期间多有些毕业生，以适应国家建设的迫切需要，去年原定的改变学制延长学习年限的计划，在部分学校不得不作适当地推迟。今后必须在不过分影响培养干部计划的前提下来逐步实施改变学制。同时，为了适应第二个五年计划期间干部质量的要求，并使高等学校可以集中力量来多办和办好本科，今后除师范专科外，在其他专业，除非有紧急需要，一般不再设置专修科，改以中等专业学校举办特别班来替代。
    以上这些问题，国务院已组织培养干部规划小组，进行研究。一经确定，我们当努力创造条件去完成。
    迅速扩大培养干部的数量并保证一定质量，从当前各种条件看，最大困难是师资力量不足，必须大力补充和提高。特别是最近几年内，师资的需要最迫急，而同国家建设部门和科学研究机关的需要矛盾也最大。我们认为为了培养建设干部与科学力量后备军，各方面大力支持高等学校多留质量较好的毕业生作母鸡，是非常必要的。否则招来学生，将会无人上课，更不用说积极开展科学研究、提高教学质量了。
    学生来源，在最近四、五年内困难也很大，除了扩大高中招生外，还需要采取动员一部分在职干部、小学教师和中等专业学校毕业生报考的办法来补充，这对各部门工作会有一定程度的影响，但为了国家长远利益，还希望各方面予以支持和帮助。
    总之高等学校完成培养干部任务，师资、学生的来源和质量必须保证，这正如工厂制造产品必须保证工人和原料的供应是一样的。二
    高等学校领导关系应该按学校性质划分——校、院长的职权应该适当扩大
    为了顺利实现今后高等教育艰巨的发展任务，还必须充分发挥各方面的积极性来共同办好学校。现有的高等学校的事业体制、计划体制、财政体制，领导关系以及毕业生全部统一分配的制度等等，过多地强调了集中统一，影响和限制了各业务部门和地方上办理高等教育事业的积极性，应该适当加以改变。我们认为，高等学校领导关系应该按学校性质划分为：主要为地方建设事业培养干部的高等学校，由地方负责直接领导；主要为中央各业务部门所属事业或全国性的某项建设事业培养干部的高等学校，其中除综合大学、与几个业务部门有关的多科性专门学院和个别单科专门学院由高等教育部直接领导外，其余应分别由有关中央业务部门直接领导。领导分工应该是：凡是由中央各业务部门或地方上领导的学校，高等教育部应该在方针、政策和教学业务上进行检查、指导、监督，制订及审批统一的规章制度和教学文件，有计划地培养和调度师资，以及协助国家计划委员会考虑新校和专业的设置与平衡事业计划；其余如日常教学工作的领导，师资的补充，基本建设、教学设备、人事编制、财务领报等等工作，都应该直接由主管部门或地方向中央有关部门负责；毕业生的分配也应该本着有利于发挥各部门、各地方积极性的精神加以适当变通。
    校、院长的职权应该加以适当扩大。过去我们在基本建设、财务领报制度和人员编制等方面积极贯彻精简节约的方针是对的，但是有些方面不免限制过紧过死，使各校很难有灵活变通的余地，在其他规章方面也有类似情况，不同程度地妨碍了学校工作。几年来学校行政与教学工作已逐步走上轨道，积累了一些经验，他们应该有较多的机动灵活的权限，这是有好处的。
                              三
    培养学生独立思考和工作能力——改进教学制度、内容和方法来逐步提高教学效果——大力改变学校搞运动的作风
    培养学生独立思考和工作能力、克服学生学习和生活过分紧张的现象是当前急待解决的一个问题。
    去年上半年不少高等学校曾有学生学习负担过重现象。全国文教会议以后，各校采取措施，修订教学计划，加强教学法工作，平衡学生作业，学习情况已有改进。虽然还是紧张的，但已不是那么忙乱了。可是最近几个月来，有不少学校反映学生课外自学的时间不足，没有充裕的时间消化和掌握所学的理论和技术，而同时学生的学习和生活又有过分紧张现象。多数学生星期日不能得到完全休息，一般要学习半天。据我部了解，上学期考试不及格的学生人数比例在不少学校增加了，学生健康方面患肺结核和消化器病症的虽有减少，但是患神经衰弱和血压高等症状的一般没有下降，有的学校且有增加。这种情况应该引起我们的严重注意。
    形成这种情况的原因是什么呢？有些专业的学习负担还有些重，有的教师教学方法还不够好，不少学生的学习方法还存在着问题，这些都会是一部分原因，都是需要我们加以研究改进的。但是就许多学校来说，最突出的问题，还是各种课外活动太多太乱，影响了学生的正常学习，因而造成了学生的学习和生活两方面都过分紧张，这是必须抓紧解决的。
    高等学校学生应该参加一定的课外活动和社会活动，才能丰富生活，扩大见闻，并有助于增进健康。但过多且乱，不顾学生学习和休息，不管条件，强求一律，就不仅要影响教学秩序，造成紧张忙乱，更要影响健康。例如推行劳卫制锻炼、开展体育活动，对于增进学生健康是有益的，必要的，也确实收到了增进健康的效果；但是我们执行时如果缺乏准备，不配合医务监督等必要的条件，不分情况，一律要求，乃至占用过多时间，就会妨碍学习，影响健康。又如参加义务劳动对于培养学生劳动观点是有好处的，但次数过多，或去处过远，影响学生正常休息，也就会影响正常学习。有的还要学生包干扫盲与捕鼠、捉雀，就更增加学生负担。再如发展学生科学小组，本来是培养学生研究兴趣，锻炼学生研究能力的，但是如果不顾学生条件，普遍开花，就会使得有些学生花费许多时间，把基础理论课的学习都耽误了来搞力所不及的研究工作。有些学校党、团的传达报告又多起来了。“班三角”（班长、班主席、团支部负责人）特别忙，管的事情范围过广，有的连评助学金管伙食都要他们来做，“班三角”之下就不得不设许多干事，有些班级设置干事20多个。这许多活动和工作挤在一起，就必然又会产生会议过多，尤其是学生中担任工作的“学生干部”，时间精力不够支配。
    由于我们不少高等学校领导者习惯于搞运动作风，同时广大的青年又不免热情激荡，求成过急，于是在国家社会主义建设高潮鼓舞下，就又发展了用搞运动的方式来推动工作的作风，不少学校并且不适当地强调了集体活动，造成群众压力，使每个学生不得不在各科学习中，在各种课外活动以至各种文化娱乐活动中，争先恐后，争取集体荣誉，因而也就实质上开展了班级之间在学习上以及在一切活动中的竞赛。学生学习本是一种艰苦的、循序渐进的脑力劳动，学校的责任在于不断改进教学制度、内容和方法来逐步提高教学效果，而不能靠搞运动、搞竞赛的方式来推进教学工作，企图速成。对不同程度、不同爱好的学生，在学习和政治思想教育中以至在社会活动中提出一般化的平均主义的要求，并使每个学生在集体压力下勉强跟随，紧张忙迫，这种作法显然又是有害的。
    有的同志片面地了解“全面发展”和“三好”的教育方针，把“全面发展”理解为“平均发展”，不顾学生的不同情况，平均主义地要求他们各门功课齐头并进，要求每个学生样样向优秀生看齐，要求全班做到模范班，要求既多，管得又死；这样不仅抹杀了学生的个性和特点，而且必然会造成学习负担过重，生活过分紧张。“全面发展”和“三好”是使学生身体、政治和专业知识随各人情况的不同，都获得一定的发展，同时也要同“因才施教”、“发挥专长”相结合，不忽视学生的个性和爱好。
    由于强调集体，一切活动齐头并进，因而对学生的社会活动要统一安排，自学的时间和内容也要统一安排。这除了造成紧张以外，还更加重了我们向来就存在的学生作息生活机械刻板的缺点。学生很少自己可以自由支配的时间来从事个人特长的活动，也就影响了他们的独立工作能力的培养。
    大力改变学校搞运动的作风，克服学生学习和生活过分紧张状况，改变学生机械刻板的生活，使学生能有较充裕的自由支配的时间，消化、巩固所学的知识、技能，并合理的发挥自己的爱好和特长，锻炼和培养学生独立工作能力，这是当前提高培养干部质量的一个关键问题，必须立即着手加以解决。过去对于培养学生独立思考能力的工作注意不够，高等教育部在领导上是有责任的。

    怎样解决教学任务和科学研究间的矛盾
    关于高等学校同科学院、各业务部门合作开展科学研究工作问题。
    高等学校的基本任务是为国家社会主义建设事业培养掌握现代科学技术水平的高级建设人才与科学后备力量；同时为了促进建设事业的发展，为了不断提高教学质量，高等学校教师又必须进行科学研究工作。高等学校中的科学力量占全国科学力量的很大一部分，为了争取在12年内使我国最急需的科学部门接近世界先进水平，高等学校除了应该积极完成培养干部任务外，在科学研究方面也负有很大的责任。为了提高高等学校的科学水平，为国家建设事业和培养专家作出重大贡献，高等学校必须有一部分学术水平很高的教师来指导重要的科学研究工作，培养大量博士、副博士、研究生。
    目前科学院和各部门都在结合编制12年的科学研究规划，考虑如何增设新的或扩大原有的科学研究机构的问题，因而也就不可免地要考虑抽调高等学校水平较高的教师来加强本部门的科学力量。但是如果削弱高等学校已经十分紧张的师资力量，尤其是降低高等学校的教师水平，也就会削弱培养科学干部与技术干部的力量，从长远着眼，这样对培养干部、对发展科学研究都是不利的。现在科学研究机关的“缺门”或薄弱环节，一般也正是当前高等教育方面的“缺门”或薄弱环节。不首先将这些“缺门”和薄弱的专业设置和加强起来，培养这方面的科学干部，科学研究工作也就很难开展。这是当前调配使用科学力量方面的一个矛盾。
    应该承认，目前高等学校教师的教学任务很繁重，今后积极开展科学研究工作，也就不可免地会在时间的安排与力量的使用上，产生一定的矛盾。
    怎样适当减轻这些矛盾呢？我们以为可以采取如下的具体措施：
    第一、科学院着重有关国家命脉的重大科学问题、大规模的综合性的研究工作，同时统一指导全国各方面的科学研究工作。直接有关生产的技术问题的研究，主要应由业务部门的研究机构担负起来。高等学校则应该根据国家总的研究工作和培养干部工作的要求，在科学院总的指导下，根据学校的类型和教师的特长，分担部分科学院所进行的理论性研究工作，接受各部门的委托，分担一部分技术问题和实际问题的研究任务；并根据高等学校本身的需要进行科学研究工作。
    第二、在当前情况下，我们建议：科学院和业务部门新设的研究机构，尽可能同有关高等学校结合，设在一起，这样既便于高等学校的教师和研究所的研究人员互相兼职，有利于开展科学研究和培养干部，也便于图书、资料、仪器设备的互相利用，节省国家投资。最好在初期就同高等学校相关教研组结合，利用高等学校教师的力量在高等学校内设置相关的科学研究室。这些研究室由高等学校领导，接受科学院和业务部门交付的任务，接受它们
  的业务指导。除利用学校的人员和教学设备外并由有关机关投资其他必要的设备，负担必要的研究费用，补充不足的人员。这样就是使高等学校在科学研究方面成为各方面科学工作的基层组织或分布网，可以兼顾教学和国家的科学研究任务，而减少矛盾。
      第三、培养研究生和博士生的任务，应由科学院同高等教育部在国家统一计划指导下，统一安排，共同订立培养计划；在招收和培养工作方面，也要互相配合，以便合理地使用导师的力量。
    第四、高等教育部和各高等学校应该大力贯彻中共中央和国务院关于知识分子问题的指示，改善教师们的生活条件和工作条件，坚决保证他们每周有六分之五用于业务工作的时间。对于科学研究有显著成就的教师，减免他们的行政工作，配备助手，必要时减少他们的教学任务；对教研组应该增加必要的教学辅助人员（我部正在大力解决中）；这都是使教师们能够多抽出时间来改进教学工作，开展科学研究和进修提高的重要条件。
      自从中共中央召开了知识分子问题会议以后，各校在改善教师生活条件方面都作了一些工作，但有的问题，如住房问题还待逐步解决。如方才鲜英代表所讲的目前教师健康状况还不好，深可忧虑，体育、医疗设施极须改善。在改善教师工作条件方面，各校也采取了一些措施，但教师们所迫切需要的图书、资料和实验设备等购置，还存在很多问题。方才孙晓村代表发言中所提的建议，我部当会同各有关部门和学校，进一步地努力加以解决，而国外书刊和科学器材的购置，更希望有关部门大力予以支援。在保证从事业务工作时间方面，大部分教师虽已相当满意，但仍有部分教师社会活动和会议还是过多，兼职情况也很少改善，而这部分教师又恰恰多是科学骨干力量，因此值得特别予以注意，还须各方面协力进一步加以解决。
    我们相信，采取上述各方面合作办法，可以在培养干部和开展科学研究工作两方面避免顾此失彼；通过高等学校贯彻改善教师们生活条件和工作条件的积极努力，会更有力地加强高等学校科学研究力量和培养干部的力量。因而我们以为，这可能是当前调配使用科学力量、有效地开展各方面科学研究工作的较好道路。
    以上所述，是否有当，尚请各位代表审查指正。
    我国高等教育，由于基础差，我们的努力又不够，工作中存在着许多缺点，远远落后于客观形势发展的要求。为了要赶上新形势的要求，迅速地尽可能地扩大培养干部的数量和努力提高培养干部的质量，我们必须注意结合中国具体情况来更好地学习苏联先进经验和先进的科学技术，创造性地加以运用；要更有效地发挥苏联专家的作用，并充分发挥本国专家的力量，改进教学与开展科学研究工作；同时，还必须注意学习各人民民主国家的先进经验，批判地吸收其他一切国家的优良经验和科学技术特长，贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，活跃学术气氛，发扬本国文化遗产。过去高等教育部的领导工作中，在这些方面都是有严重缺点的，今后当注意改正。我们相信在中共中央和国务院的加强领导下，在有关部门和各省市以及其他有关方面大力协助支持下，发挥全体高等教育工作者的积极性和创造性，一致努力，我国高等教育事业是一定能够胜利前进的。
