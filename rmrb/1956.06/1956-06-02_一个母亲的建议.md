    A Mother's Suggestion
    Bing Xin
    Last Sunday, early in the morning, I saw several young mothers from my window, pulling their children, who were jumping and laughing, heading out of the yard happily and busily. I stood by the window and couldn't help but smile knowingly. On a grand holiday for children, what mother wouldn't want to dress her child in fresher, more beautiful clothes? I had heard that they were going into the city to buy clothes and shoes for their children, and I sincerely wished them a successful "shopping trip."

    That evening, a mother came to see me, carrying a bundle, and asked as soon as she entered, "Do you have a sewing machine? Can I borrow it to do some work?" She sat down beside me, looking tired but excited.

    I said, "Didn't you go to the city for the whole day, surely..."

    She fanned her slightly sweaty face with a handkerchief and smiled with a frown, "Don't mention it! I walked in and out of companies and markets all day, but I couldn't buy what I wanted; in the end, the children got anxious and I got tired, so I had to pick a couple of kinds of printed fabric and ask a tailor to make them. Who knew that clothing stores not only didn't have styles for little girls' clothes, but they weren't taking orders either, saying 'Pick it up in three weeks,' or 'Pick it up in a month.' I had no choice but to bring the fabric back. You see, I work during the day, and I have to prepare lessons and study at night, how can I spare so much time to do sewing? If I had known this, I would have prepared to do it slowly myself, this is really frustrating!"

    I laughed and said, "Your taste is too high, I don't believe there wasn't something among those hundreds of children's clothes that you liked?"

    She stood up and smiled, "You know my taste, don't you? Neither my children nor I have ever worn anything particularly fancy or outstanding. I just want something simple and elegant, no matter the style, material, or color, as long as it suits the age, status, and gender of the person wearing it. You can see for yourself, a large row and a big pile of clothes are hanging and displayed in the store, but when you look closely, there are not many that are particularly pleasing to the eye! Take small shirts, for example, I prefer white ones, or plain ones without any mixed flowers, because these shirts are easier to match with skirts and sweaters. But most of the small shirts on the market are made of checkered cloth, and they are in dark, mixed colors like jujube red, golden yellow, dark green, and emerald blue... the large checks are so messy and hot to look at! I had to give up the plan of buying shirts to match with skirts and pick out dresses instead. And the dresses, some have suitable colors but the style is not good; the shoulders are too narrow, the waist is too small, and the skirt is too long. Some have suitable styles, but the colors are not well-matched; for example, a bright red dress has a blue trim; a light red dress has a banana-green trim. After picking and choosing, there are very few with harmonious colors. I turned around and went to look at the little socks, but unexpectedly, these small things were even more troublesome! White or solid-colored short socks are very rare, most are long socks that reach the knees, with red, yellow, blue, green... and even jujube red, tan... hoops all the way up, like a flowered snake! These products that waste cotton thread, dye, and effort, are ugly when you first wear them, and who knows what they will look like after washing!..."

    Speaking of this, she suddenly laughed and said, "Can you imagine a little girl, no matter how beautiful she is, wearing this kind of dark, mixed-color, large checkered shirt, no matter what color skirt and sweater she is wearing, with these ten-odd hoops of dark, mixed colors wrapped around her legs, and two small braids, two uneven braids, tied with two kinds of 'clashing' ribbons..."

    I also laughed and said, "And her face is covered with powder, and her lips are covered with lipstick..."

    She also laughed, then frowned and said, "Talking about little girls wearing rouge and powder really makes one feel physically uncomfortable! In a happy and healthy environment, doesn't every child emit a natural, bright radiance, like a lotus flower emerging from the water? I think that except for acting, children look better and more natural without makeup, even when singing or reciting on stage at night; not to mention during the day. Originally, a lovely little face is covered with a vulgar clay mask, this is truly 'gilding the lotus'!"

    I laughed and said, "You are expounding lofty arguments again, let's get back to the topic. Speaking of the ribbons for tying hair, they have the magic of 'finishing touch' in harmonizing the colors of clothes and socks, buying ribbons shouldn't be a problem, right?"

    She nodded and said, "The ribbon problem is relatively simple. Sometimes the leftover cloth scraps from making clothes for them, thinner and softer ones, can be used to make hair ties." She sat down, opened the bundle, and unfolded two pieces of thin printed fabric: one was light blue with small white flowers, and the other was red with small white dots, and said, "These two pieces of printed fabric are not bad, right? I want to use the simplest styles, both short-sleeved dresses, with plain white collars and white cuffs. The red one will be matched with red socks and red ribbons, and the light blue one will be matched with light blue socks and ribbons, or else I will use the cloth scraps left over from making the clothes to make hair ties, that will do too.

    I seemed to see their Xiao Min and Xiao Ying, wearing these two sets of simple and lovely clothes, standing in front of me with smiles. This illusion made my heart and eyes feel bright and comfortable!

    I asked, "Xiao Min and Xiao Ying have theirs, what about Xiao Duan? Don't boys need to be dressed up?"

    She laughed and said, "Xiao Duan is easy to handle! He has his second older sister's light yellow long-sleeved shirts that she has outgrown; his father has a pair of coffee-colored corduroy pants with a hole in the knee, cutting off the two legs is just enough to make Xiao Duan a pair of shorts. What can I do? There are even fewer children's clothes designed for boys, so it's better to wear old clothes.

    I said, "Okay, 'everything is ready, except for the east wind.' Unfortunately, I don't have a sewing machine and can't help you. Don't your neighbors all have sewing machines?"

    She said, "Aren't they all like me, they haven't bought anything either, and they are all rushing to make their own."

    I laughed and said, "You young people are never satisfied, it's much better than before. In the past, children's clothes were all made by ourselves, there weren't hundreds of children's clothes for us to choose from?"

    She laughed and said, "There will be progress only if we are not satisfied! Besides, most of us mothers now have our own jobs. But now people's lives are improving day by day, and the prospects of a socialist society are becoming clearer and clearer. With spiritual joy and economic abundance, what mother wouldn't want to take a break from her busy schedule and dress up her children properly? The country is encouraging textile factories and children's clothing companies to print various colors of printed fabric and make diverse children's clothes, both to dress up our precious next generation and to save mothers' energy and time, out of deep concern for women and children. While we are 'grateful', we also have some suggestions..."

    I asked, "What do you suggest?"

    She said, "I suggest that textile factories produce more printed fabrics that are simple but not dim, bright but not vulgar, suitable for making children's clothes, or at least produce more solid-colored fine cloths with different tones, such as from dark red to light red, from dark green to light green... that don't fade, like the so-called 'Goryeo cloth' and 'Goryeo gauze' that Beijing used to have. This way, the needs of people with various preferences can be met.

    "I suggest that sock factories weave more white short socks to match spring and summer children's clothes, with a few narrow, single-colored lines added to the sock cuff. Or just solid colors; this saves materials and effort.

    "I suggest that children's clothing companies, whether designing a child's cloth garment, silk garment, or sweater, should not think that the more colors, the better it looks. We Chinese people have had very high aesthetic standards since ancient times, and we have never liked to mix many unharmonious colors together."

    Speaking of this, she couldn't help but laugh herself: "I'm 'expounding lofty arguments' again, I have class early tomorrow morning, I'll come back to chat when I have time."

    I also stood up and asked with a smile, "Have you finished all your suggestions?"

    She packed up her bundle and laughed, "I can't think of anything else for the time being, if these problems are not well resolved by next June 1st, or if there are any new problems, then I'll make suggestions again. In short, we, the mothers of this new society, only hope that the relevant departments in our new society will make more efforts, help each other, and dress our children—the successors to building a socialist society—even more beautifully!"

    一个母亲的建议
    冰心
    上一个星期天，一清早我从窗户里看见好几个年轻的母亲，拉着又跳又笑的孩子们，高兴而又匆忙地往院外走。我站在窗前，忍不住发出了会心的微笑。在一个小孩子自己的盛大节日，那一个母亲不想把孩子打扮得更新鲜，更美丽？我早就听说她们要进城去给孩子买衣服鞋袜了，我衷心的祝福她们“采购”的成功。
    那天晚上，一个母亲来看我，夹着一个包袱，进门就问：“您有缝纫机没有？借我赶一赶活吧。”一面疲乏而又兴奋地便在我旁边坐下。
    我说：“你不是到城里去了一天，难道……”
  她用手绢扇着微微出汗的脸，皱眉笑说：“别提了！我在公司里，市场里走进走出，绕了一天，就没有买到我所要买的东西；最后，小孩子也急了，我也累了，只好挑一两种花布，请裁缝去做。那知道成衣店里不但没有小女孩的衣服样子，而且也都不收活了，什么‘三星期以后取件’吧，‘一个月以后取件’吧，我只好又拿了回来。您想，我白天上班，晚上又要备课，又要学习，那能匀出那么多的工夫来做活？早知如此，我也就老早准备自己慢慢的做了，这样真赶得人心焦！”
    我笑说：“你的口味也太高了，我就不信那几百种童装之中，就没有你合意的？”
    她站起来笑说：“我的口味您还不知道？从我的孩子到我，多会儿穿过什么希奇出色的衣服？我只要素净大方，不论什么式样，什么材料，什么颜色，只要适合于穿衣服的人的年龄，身份，性别就可以了。您不信自己去看，店里摊上，花花绿绿地挂了一大排，摆了一大堆，细细看去，竟没有多少特别顺眼的！就说小衬衫吧，我是比较喜欢白的，或是素色没有杂花的，因为这样的衬衫比较容易配裙子和毛衣。可是市上那些小衬衫多半是格子布的，而且是枣红，金黄，墨绿，翠蓝……深色杂色的大格子，看了就使人觉得又乱又热！我只好放弃了买衬衫配裙子的计划，去挑那连裙的小衣服。而衣服呢，有的颜色合式了，样子却不好看；肩膀太窄，腰身太小，裙子太长。有的样子合式了，颜色又配得不好；比方说，大红的衣服吧，却沿上一道蓝边；浅红的衣服吧，却沿上蕉绿色的边，挑来挑去，就很少有颜色调和的。我掉转来又去看小袜子，不料这小小的东西，却更伤脑筋！白色或纯色的短袜子，根本就很少，多半是长几及膝的长统袜子，红、黄、蓝、绿……甚至于枣红、棕黄……一箍一箍的套将起来，像一条花蛇！这种费棉线，费染料，费工夫的出品，初穿就难看，洗后还不知道怎样呢！……”
    说到这里，她忽然笑了起来说：“您能不能想像一个小姑娘，不管她长的多好，一穿上这种深色杂色的大花格子衬衫，不管配上什么颜色的裙子和毛衣，腿上再绕上这十几道深色杂色的箍，头上的两根小小辫儿，两根大小辫儿，再系上两种‘犯色’的丝带……”
    我也笑说：“脸上再搽上脂粉，嘴唇上再抹上口红……”
    她也笑了，又皱眉说：“谈到小女孩子搽胭脂抹粉，真是使人看了会引起生理上的不舒服！在快乐健康的环境里，那一个孩子不像出水的莲花一般，发出自然朗润的光辉？我认为除了演剧，小孩子就是在夜晚上台唱歌、朗诵，也是以不加脂粉，比较的更好看，更自然；白天更不用说了。本来嘛，好好的一付可爱的小脸，偏要给她带上一个俗不可耐的泥面具，这真是‘莲花镀金’！”
    我笑说：“你又发挥高论了，话说回来吧。谈到系头发的丝带，在调和衣服袜子的颜色上，倒是有‘画龙点睛’之妙，买丝带该没有问题吧？”
    她点点头说：“丝带问题比较简单，有时候给他们做衣服剩下的布条，薄些软些的，就可以做发结。”她坐了下来，打开包袱，抖开了两块薄薄的花布：一块是浅蓝色带白色小花的，一块是红地带小白点的，一面说：“这两块花布还不难看吧？我想就用最简单的式样，都是短袖子的短衣裙，仄仄的白领子，白袖口。红色的就配上红袜子和红丝带，浅蓝的就配浅蓝的袜子和丝带，要不然就用做衣服剩下的布条做发结，也过得去了。
    我仿佛已经看见他们的小敏和小樱，穿上这两套大方可爱的衣服，笑嘻嘻地站在我面前了。这幻像就使我心里眼里都觉着明亮，舒服！
    我就问：“小敏和小樱都有了，小端呢？男孩子难道就不要打扮？”
    她笑说：“小端好办！有他二姐穿小了的浅黄色长袖的衬衫；他爸爸一条咖啡色灯心绒的裤子，膝盖上破了，两个裤腿剪下来，正够做小端一条短裤。有什么办法呢？为男孩子设计的童装更少得可怜，还不如穿穿旧衣服。
    我说：“好，‘万事俱备，只欠东风’了。可惜我没有缝纫机，不能帮你的忙。你的那几位街坊不是都有缝纫机吗？”
    她说：“她们还不是和我一样，都没买到什么，也都在自己赶做呢。”
    我笑说：“你们年轻人总没有满足的时候，比起从前来，真不知好多少了。我们从前的小孩衣服，还不都是自己做，那有几百种童装让我们挑？”
    她笑说：“不满足才会有进步呀！再说，现在我们做母亲的人，绝大多数都有自己岗位上的工作。可是现在人民生活一天一天地改善，社会主义社会的远景，一天一天的明朗，在精神欢畅，经济充裕之下，那一个母亲，不想忙里偷闲，好好地打扮打扮自己的孩子？国家就为了对妇女和儿童的深切关怀，才鼓励纺织工厂啦，童装公司啦，印出各种各色的花布，做出多种多样的童装，一面打扮我们宝贵的下一代，一面节省母亲的精力时间，我们在‘感激之余’，也还有些建议……”
    我问：“你建议什么？”
    她说：“我建议纺织工厂再多出些素静而不黯淡，鲜明而不俗气的，适宜于做童装的花布，或者至少要多出些各种色调不同，比如从深红到浅红，从深绿到浅绿……纯色的，不退色的细布，就像北京从前有过的所谓‘高丽布’，‘高丽纱’那样。这样就可以适应各种爱好的人的需要。
      “我建议织袜厂为着配合春夏季童装，多织些白色短袜，袜统上加上仄仄的，一种颜色的几道细边。要不就是纯色的；这样，又省料，又省工夫。
      “我建议童装公司，无论设计一件儿童的布衣，绸衣，毛衣，都不要以为颜色越多，就越好看。我们中国人，自古以来，就有很高的审美标准，从不喜欢把许多不调和的颜色，参杂在一起。”
    说到这里，她自己也忍不住笑了：“我又‘发挥高论’了，明天一早还有课呢，有空再来聊吧。”
    我也站起来，笑问：“你的建议都提完了没有？”
    她一面收拾起包袱，一面笑说：“暂时还想不起来，等明年六一节，如果这几个问题还没有很好的解决，或者又有什么新的问题，那时再建议吧。总而言之，我们这些新社会的母亲们，只希望我们新社会里的各有关部门，多方努力，彼此帮忙，把我们的孩子——建设社会主义社会的接班人，打扮的更美一些！”
