    Moscow Dispatch: The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union issued a public notice to all members of the Communist Youth League and young people on June 22, calling on 200,000 young people to help farmers in the New Lands harvest crops within two months. This call was immediately met with enthusiastic responses from young people in Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, Minsk, and other places. They are willing to dedicate their summer vacation to take on this glorious task.
    The Communist Youth League organizations of various agencies, factories, and schools in Moscow have been continuously receiving applications from young people. On the first day alone, more than 10,000 people expressed their willingness to go to the New Lands to harvest crops. Leonid Robbikov, a second-year honors student in the Transportation Machine Manufacturing Department of Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School, said, "I believe it is the duty of a Communist Youth League member to go where my help is needed." At the Minsk Kirov Forestry Technical School, 600 students decided to go to the state farms in the Kustanai region to help with the harvest. In Chkalov, many young people at the Molotov Electrical Engineering Technical School are determined to participate in the harvesting work. Many have returned their sanatorium vouchers. Yuri Sukhov gave up his plan to recuperate in Crimea and prepared to go to the New Lands to help with the harvest.

    苏联共青团中央号召青年帮助新地农民收割庄稼
    本报莫斯科讯　苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央六月二十二日向全国共青团员和青年发出公告，号召二十万青年在两个月期间内帮助新地农民收割庄稼。这一号召，立即得到莫斯科、列宁格勒、哈尔科夫、明斯克和其他各地青年的热烈响应。他们愿意献出暑假时间担负起这一光荣任务。
    莫斯科各机关、工厂和学校的共青团组织不断地收到青年们的申请书，仅在第一天，已有一万多人表示愿意到新地收割庄稼。巴曼莫斯科高等技术学校运输机器制造系二年级优等生列奥尼得·罗比柯夫说：“我认为到需要我帮助的地方去是共青团员的职责。”在明斯克基洛夫林业技术专科学校有六百个同学决定到库斯坦奈区的国营农场帮助收割。在契卡洛夫，莫洛托夫电工技术专科学校许多青年决心参加收割工作，不少人退回疗养券，尤里·苏哈夫放弃到克里米亚去疗养的计划，准备到新地帮助收割。
