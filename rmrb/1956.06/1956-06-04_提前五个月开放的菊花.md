    Chrysanthemums Blooming Five Months Early

    The chrysanthemums in Lianhu Park in Xi'an City have bloomed five months earlier this year. Tourists flock to see them all day long.

    The early blooming of chrysanthemums in Lianhu Park this year is due to the park staff's artificial control based on the characteristics of chrysanthemums. That is, the normally growing chrysanthemums from last autumn were repeatedly bud-picked during the budding stage to prevent them from blooming. They were then moved indoors, treated with artificial lighting to extend the daylight hours, and kept in a greenhouse throughout the winter. This spring, they were moved back to the nursery for growth. The chrysanthemums sprouted buds in March this year, and now most of the flowers have bloomed, with the same shape and color as the flowers that bloom in autumn. These chrysanthemums are valuable varieties such as 'Blood-Stained Battle Robe' and 'Pink Lotus'. (Xi'an Daily Editorial Department) (Attached picture)

    提前五个月开放的菊花
    西安市莲湖公园的菊花，今年提前了五个月开放。前往观赏的游人终日络绎不绝。
    莲湖公园菊花今年提前开放，是这个公园职工根据菊花的习性，施行了人工控制。就是将去秋正常生长的菊花，在孕蕾期进行多次摘蕾，不让她开花；并移到室内，用灯光处理，加长日照时间。冬天一直放在温室里。今春又移至圃地生长。菊花在今年三月间吐出花蕾，现在花已大部开放，和秋天开的花形色完全一样。这些菊花是：血染征袍、粉荷莲等名贵品种。　（西安日报编辑部）（附图片）
