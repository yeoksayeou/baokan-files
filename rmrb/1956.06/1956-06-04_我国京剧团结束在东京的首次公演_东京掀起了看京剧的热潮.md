Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 3rd: The Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan concluded its first performance in Tokyo on the evening of the 2nd.

The Peking Opera Troupe performed a total of seven shows at the Kabuki-za Theater after the opening night on May 30th. During this time, a Peking Opera craze swept through Tokyo.

The final performance on the evening of the 2nd was particularly popular, with the four-story theater packed to capacity. The audience unanimously praised programs such as "The Empty City Stratagem," "Autumn River," "Hunting the Tiger," and "Farewell My Concubine" performed by Mei Lanfang and Yuan Shihai. Prince Mikasa and his wife, the third younger brother of the Japanese Emperor, also attended the theater. After watching the performance, they specifically visited Mei Lanfang, Ouyang Yuqian, and others backstage. Prince Mikasa expressed his gratitude to Mei Lanfang for leading the Peking Opera Delegation to Japan for a performance tour.

In the previous two days, Prince and Princess Takamatsu, the second younger brother of the Japanese Emperor, Liberal Democratic Party Diet member Yakichiro Suma, Socialist Party Diet members Kei Hoashi and Ichiko Kamichika, film director Satsuo Yamamoto, cartoonists Kon Shimizu and Ryuichi Yokoyama, and other well-known figures from society had come to watch Peking Opera.

After watching the performance, Yakichiro Suma said, "Excellent! I have seen Peking Opera several times before the war. But this performance is completely new compared to what I saw before." He added, "This kind of innovative performance is something that the Japanese theater community should learn from."

On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe was invited to attend a welcome reception hosted by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association.

    二日晚上的最后一场，观众特别踊跃，把四层大楼的戏院挤得满满的。他们对于“空城计”、“秋江”、“猎虎”和梅兰芳、袁世海表演的“霸王别姬”等节目一致表示赞扬。日本天皇三弟三笠宫夫妇也到戏院来看戏。他们看过戏后，特地到后台去访问了梅兰芳、欧阳予倩等。三笠宫对梅兰芳率领京剧代表团到日本访问演出表示感谢。
    前两天，日本天皇的二弟高松宫夫妇，自由民主党国会议员须磨弥吉郎，社会党国会议员帆足计、神近市子，电影导演山本萨夫，漫画家清水昆、横山隆一等社会有名人士都曾前来观看京剧。
    须磨弥吉郎看了戏以后说，好极了！我在战前曾经看过好几次京剧。可是这次的演出比以前所看到的，面目焕然一新。他又说，这种革新的演出，是日本戏剧界应该学习的。
    三日下午，中国京剧团应邀出席了东京华侨总会主办的欢迎酒会。
