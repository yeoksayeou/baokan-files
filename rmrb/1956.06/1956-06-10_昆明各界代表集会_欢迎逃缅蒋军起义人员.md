Xinhua News Agency Report: Kunming City representatives from all ethnic groups and sectors, totaling over one thousand people, gathered on the evening of the 7th to welcome the twenty-five former Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who fled Burma and returned to the motherland after defecting. The leadership of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming awarded a total of 1,200 yuan in bonuses to Li Zhaosheng, Li Xiaozhuang, Chen Yulin, and Lei Qiaofang, the four individuals who led the uprising and made meritorious contributions, and presented each of the twenty-five individuals, including Li Zhaosheng, with a gift. Prior to this, when Li Zhaosheng and others returned to the Yunnan border, the PLA border defense troops had already issued more than 1,300 yuan in bonuses according to the weapons they brought back. Both award ceremonies were conducted in accordance with the Ministry of National Defense's policies and reward measures for Chiang Kai-shek troops who revolt or surrender.

Ding Rongchang, Major General of the Kunming Garrison, and Pan Shuoduan, Mayor of Kunming, both spoke at the meeting, expressing their hope that Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan or those who had fled to Burma would abandon the darkness and turn to the light, returning to the motherland.

Xie Chongwen, Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who served as Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Yunnan Security Forces and Chief of Staff of the Yunnan Pacification Headquarters before liberation, said at the meeting: those who participated in the Yunnan uprising in the past are now living and working in peace and contentment, each finding their place, and all feeling the warmth of the motherland's big family. Xie Chongwen said: I hope that Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan or those who have fled to Burma will make a decisive decision without further hesitation or waiting to see, and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible to contribute to the construction of the motherland.

Li Zhaosheng delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the twenty-five people who returned to the country after their uprising, thanking the people of the motherland for the generous treatment and rewards given to them.

    驻昆明部队首长丁荣昌少将和昆明市市长潘朔端都在会上讲了话，希望在台湾或逃到缅甸的国民党军政人员弃暗投明归来。
    中国人民政治协商会议云南省委员会副主席谢崇文，在解放前曾担任国民党云南保安副司令、云南绥靖公署参谋长等职，他在会上说：当年参加云南起义的人员，现在都安居乐业，各得其所，都感到祖国大家庭的温暖。谢崇文说：我希望在台湾或逃到缅甸的国民党军政人员当机立断，莫再迟疑观望，早日回到祖国怀抱，为建设祖国而贡献力量。
