Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd dispatch from TASS: Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov and Egyptian Republic Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser issued a joint communiqué. The communiqué stated, "They believe that developing Soviet-Egyptian relations in political, economic, and cultural cooperation is in the interests of both peoples and is a significant contribution to consolidating peace and security."

This joint communiqué was issued after talks held by Shepilov with Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser in Cairo from June 16th to 22nd during his visit. The talks took place in an atmosphere of sincerity and friendship, during which the two sides extensively exchanged views on issues of Soviet-Egyptian relations and some important international issues of mutual interest.

The communiqué stated that both sides "satisfactorily confirmed that they hold completely consistent views on the issues discussed in the talks."

The communiqué also stated that both sides "reiterated in the talks that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Egyptian Republic are based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the famous principles of the Bandung Conference. They reaffirmed their desire to continue cooperation in consolidating world peace and expressed their firm conviction that their efforts, as well as the efforts of other countries inspired by the will for peace, will promote the further relaxation of international tensions and the consolidation of world peace."

Shepilov left Cairo on June 22nd to visit Syria. In a statement issued before his departure, he expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality given by Egypt, and he hoped that the Egyptian people would achieve success in all aspects of implementing measures to develop national industry, agriculture, and culture, so that Egypt would become a free, independent, and strong country with developed industry and agriculture.

In his statement, Shepilov said that he had obtained the most valuable thing from his visit to Cairo, which was many sincere friends willing to consolidate and develop Soviet-Egyptian friendship. He said: "The friendship of the people is a very valuable alloy, which will not leave any gaps or loopholes for the dark forces of imperialism, which, for selfish purposes, attempt to undermine relations between peoples, spread suspicion, and create disputes."

Shepilov finally stated that he would look forward to the visit of Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser to the Soviet Union in August this year, and he believed that the Egyptian Prime Minister's visit would be "an important new stage in the development of the eternal and unbreakable Soviet-Egyptian friendship."

    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社二十二日讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫和埃及共和国总理加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔发表了一项联合公报。公报说，“他们认为，在政治、经济和文化等合作中发展苏埃关系，是符合两国人民的利益的，并且是对巩固和平和安全事业的重大贡献。”
    这项联合公报是谢皮洛夫从六月十六日到二十二日在开罗进行访问期间同埃及总理加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔举行会谈后发表的。会谈充满真诚和友好气氛，在会谈期间双方就苏埃关系问题和双方都感兴趣的一些重要国际问题广泛地交换了意见。
    公报说，双方“满意地确认对会谈中所讨论的问题抱有完全一致的观点”。
    公报又说，双方“在会谈中再次强调指出，苏联和埃及共和国的友好关系是以联合国宪章的原则和万隆会议的著名原则为基础的。他们申述了为巩固世界和平而继续合作的愿望，并且表示坚信：他们的这些努力以及为和平意志所鼓舞的其他国家的努力，将会促进国际紧张局势的进一步和缓和世界和平的巩固。”

    谢皮洛夫在声明中表示他这次到开罗来获得了最宝贵的东西，这就是许多愿意巩固并发展苏埃友谊的真诚的朋友。他说：“人民的友谊是一种很贵重的合金，它不会给那些为了自私自利的目的，企图破坏各国人民之间的关系、散布猜疑和制造纠纷的帝国主义黑暗力量留下任何缝隙和漏洞。”
