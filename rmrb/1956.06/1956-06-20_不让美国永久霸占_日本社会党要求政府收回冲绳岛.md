Xinhua News Agency, June 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement yesterday demanding that the Japanese government, in accordance with the ardent hopes of the Japanese people and the residents of Okinawa Island, immediately take measures to completely return Okinawa Island to Japan, and oppose turning Okinawa Island into an American military base.

The Socialist Party statement said that the United States, in recently published official documents, revealed its intention to make Okinawa Island and its military bases semi-permanent. According to a report submitted to Congress by the US House Armed Services Committee, the United States wants to maintain its military bases on Okinawa Island on a "virtually permanent basis."

The statement said that this is a lawless step that completely ignores the public opinion of Japan and Okinawa Island. The American plan to expand military bases on Okinawa Island will shatter the hopes of Okinawa Island residents and subject them to terrible hardship and suffering.

The Hatoyama government held a cabinet meeting today and decided to convey the wishes of the people of Okinawa Island to the US government. Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu also stated that he would take measures to protect the interests of Okinawa Island residents.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Tokyo Dispatch: Representatives of Okinawa Island in Tokyo handed a resolution of the Okinawa Island Legislative Assembly to the Japanese government on the 16th. The resolution demands that the Japanese government protest to the US government to prevent the US from requisitioning more land on Okinawa Island to build military bases.

According to a recommendation submitted to the House of Representatives by the US House Armed Services Committee, the United States has decided to pay the rent for land leased for military purposes in a lump sum and has decided to acquire an additional 12,000 acres of land.

The Okinawa Island Legislative Assembly said in its June 12th resolution, "This will create a harsh precedent for US confiscation of property." The resolution calls on the Japanese government to take action to protect the property rights and rights to survival of Okinawa residents.

On the same day, Kozo Ito, chairman of the Policy Deliberation Council of the Japan Socialist Party, also issued a statement in Nagoya, advocating that the Japanese government immediately lodge a serious protest with the US government, demanding the withdrawal of the recommendation of the US House Armed Services Committee. The statement also said: The land rent paid by the United States is far from meeting the requirements of local residents and is making it increasingly difficult for local residents to live.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: The "Mainichi Shimbun" published an editorial on the 16th, expressing dissatisfaction with the statements made by US Department of Defense officials in Congress. These officials said that, if necessary, according to the Japan-US "Security Treaty," the United States may have to use its military bases in Japan for one hundred years.

The newspaper said that although the Japan-US "Security Treaty" stipulated that the treaty would remain in effect until both countries recognized that there were other measures to guarantee Japan's "security," the effective period of the treaty was not clearly stipulated. It said that the Japanese people hope to formulate some measures to replace the treaty as soon as possible.

The "Mainichi Shimbun," in talking about the Okinawa Island issue, expressed the hope that the United States would consider returning it to Japan.

    不让美国永久霸占
    日本社会党要求政府收回冲绳岛
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本社会党在昨天发表声明，要求日本政府按照日本人和冲绳岛居民的热烈希望，立即采取措施使冲绳岛完全归还日本，反对把冲绳岛变成美国军事基地。
    社会党声明说，美国在最近发表的官方文件中暴露了它想使冲绳岛和它的军事基地半永久化的打算。据美国众议院军事委员会向国会提出的报告，美国要在“实际上是永久性的基础上”保持冲绳岛的军事基地。
    声明说，这是完全无视日本和冲绳岛的舆论的一个无法无天的步骤。美国扩大冲绳岛军事基地的计划将使冲绳岛居民的希望破灭并且使他们遭受可怕的艰难和困苦。
    鸠山政府今天举行内阁会议，决定要向美国政府转达冲绳岛人民的希望。外务相重光葵也表示要采取措施，保护冲绳岛居民的利益。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：在东京的冲绳岛代表十六日把冲绳岛立法院的一项决议交给了日本政府。这项决议要求日本政府向美国政府提出抗议，阻止美国再征用冲绳岛的土地来建立军事基地。
    根据美国众议院军事委员会向众议院提出的建议，美国决定一次付清为军事目的而租用的土地的租金并且决定增加接收一万二千英亩土地。
    冲绳岛立法院在它的六月十二日的决议中说，“这将开创美国没收财产的一个严酷的先例。”决议要求日本政府采取行动保护冲绳居民的财产权和生存的权利。
    同一天，日本社会党政策审议会会长伊藤好道在名古屋发表声明，也主张日本政府立即向美国政府提出严重抗议，要求撤销美国众议院军事委员会的建议。声明又说：美国付出的地租远不能达到当地居民的要求，并且使当地居民的生活越来越困难。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：“每日新闻”十六日发表社论，表示不满美国国防部官员们在国会的发言。这些官员们说，如果必要的话，根据日美“安全条约”，美国可能要把它在日本的军事基地使用一百年。
    这家报纸说，虽然日美“安全条约”曾规定这个条约要维持有效到两个国家都承认已经有其他一些保证日本“安全”的措施的时候为止，但是对这个条约的有效期限并没有明确规定。它说，日本人民希望尽快拟定出一些代替这个条约的措施。
    “每日新闻”在谈到冲绳岛问题的时候，表示希望美国考虑把它归还日本。
