A New Pesticide for Plant Pest Control
Huang Ruilun

Systemic insecticides are a new type of pesticide for controlling plant pests. Plants treated with this pesticide, either by coating or spraying, can remain free from pests for a relatively long period, much like people who receive vaccinations to prevent infectious diseases.

For a long time, people have used pesticides such as calcium arsenate, sodium fluosilicate, pyrethrum, DDT, BHC, and 1605 to control pests. Although these pesticides are very effective, they also have many shortcomings. For example, if the spraying is not thorough, plants will still be harmed by pests. Also, the pesticides are easily affected by sunlight, wind, and rain, and quickly lose their effectiveness, generally lasting only about a week. Furthermore, beneficial insects that prey on pests will also be poisoned and die if they come into contact with broad-spectrum pesticides like DDT, BHC, and 1605.

Systemic insecticides do not have these drawbacks. When coated or sprayed on any part of a plant, such as branches or leaves, they are absorbed by the tissues within a few hours and quickly transported to all other tissues, so that the entire plant's sap contains insecticidal toxins. This toxin usually remains effective for up to two weeks or a month before breaking down into non-toxic substances in the plant tissue. During this period, any pests that harm the plant, whether visible or hidden, whether feeding on the leaves or the plant's sap, will be poisoned and die. Because of this, it is not necessary to use a lot of manpower to spray multiple times and be very thorough. Seeds soaked in this pesticide will produce seedlings that are also protected from pests for a certain period. Because beneficial insects that prey on pests do not eat the stems and leaves of plants, and systemic insecticides are quickly absorbed by the plant after application, beneficial insects rarely have the opportunity to come into contact with the pesticide, so they are not poisoned. At the same time, the systemic insecticides used are also selective, so even if they come into direct contact with beneficial insects, they will not be poisoned to death.

Of course, systemic insecticides also have their shortcomings. Because systemic insecticides are highly selective, they can control fewer types of pests. Currently, several well-known systemic insecticides can only control aphids and scale insects at normal usage concentrations. Although some systemic insecticides have a broader spectrum of activity and can control chewing pests, they are also very toxic to higher animals, making it difficult to apply them widely. The most famous systemic insecticides, such as Systox, 1059 or Methyl Systox, do not accumulate in higher animals; however, they are still quite toxic. After use, they must undergo a period of time to break down and become ineffective in the plant, generally requiring a month during the plant's vigorous growth period. To protect the safety of humans and animals, it is best not to use systemic insecticides on fruit trees or vegetables that are about to be harvested and eaten.

In 1950, Chinese scientist Qi Zhaosheng discovered that soaking seeds in Systox can protect broad bean seedlings from aphid infestation for a long time. Recently, he also discovered that applying the systemic insecticide 1059 to cotton stems can very economically achieve the effect of controlling cotton aphids and red spiders. 1059 is already in the planning stages of production in China.

Currently, scientists in various countries are working to research and synthesize better and more ideal systemic insecticides. In the near future, we will be able to buy such a systemic insecticide on the market, apply a little of it to fruit trees and vegetable crops, and it will kill the pests on them, while being safe and harmless to humans and animals. At that time, we will no longer have the trouble of preparing medicines, spraying medicines, and using sprayers or dusters.

    一种新的防治植物虫害的药剂  
    黄瑞纶
    内吸杀虫药剂是一种新的防治植物虫害的药剂。用这种药剂涂抹或者喷洒过的植物，可以在比较长的时间内不受害虫的侵害，很像人们打了防疫针可以预防传染病一样。
    长时期以来，人们都是用砒酸钙、氟矽酸钠、除虫菊、滴滴涕、六六六、1605等药物防治虫害。这些药物的杀虫效果虽然很好，但是缺点也很多。譬如说，喷洒得不周到，植物仍会遭受虫害，而且药物经不起日晒、风吹、雨淋，很快就失去效用，一般只能保持一个星期左右。同时，捕食害虫的益虫沾上那些杀虫范围很广的药剂如滴滴涕、六六六、1605等也会中毒死亡。
    内吸杀虫药剂没有这些缺点。把它涂抹或者喷洒在植物的任何部位，如在部分枝干上、叶子上，在几个小时以内，就会被枝干或者叶子的组织吸收，并且会很快地传导到植物的其它各个组织，使整个植物的体液里都含有杀虫的毒素。这种毒素一般要保持到两个星期或者一个月以后，才在植物组织里分解成为无毒物质。在这段时间里，不管是可见的或者是暗藏的；不管是以植物的叶子为食料的或者是以植物组织的汁液为食料的害虫，只要来伤害这棵植物，就会中毒死亡。正因为这样，使用这种药剂就不必用很多的人力去喷洒多次并且要喷洒的非常周到了。用这种药剂浸泡种子，所出的种苗在一定时间里也不会受虫害。由于捕食害虫的益虫不吃植物的茎叶，而内吸杀虫药剂施用以后很快地就被植物吸收，益虫很少有接触药剂的机会，因此不会中毒。同时，施用的内吸杀虫药剂也是有选择的，即或直接接触到益虫，也不致使它们中毒死亡。
    当然，内吸杀虫药剂也还是有缺点的。内吸杀虫药剂因为选择性很强，所以能防治的害虫比较少。目前几种著名的内吸杀虫药剂在一般的使用浓度下只能防治蚜虫和茧类害虫。有几种内吸杀虫药剂的杀虫范围虽然比较广，可以防治咀嚼口器的害虫，但是，对于高等动物的毒力也很强，恐怕很难广泛应用。目前最著名的内吸杀虫药剂如内吸剂三号、1059或甲基1059在高等动物体内虽然没有积累作用；但是，仍然有相当的毒力，在使用以后，必须经过一个时期才能在植物体内分解失效，在植物生长旺盛的时期一般也须要一个月。为了保护人畜的安全，最好不在将近收获而即待食用的果树或蔬菜上使用内吸杀虫药剂。
    我国科学家齐兆生在1950年就发现用内吸剂三号浸种，可以在很长的时间里保护蚕豆的幼苗不被蚜虫侵害。最近他又发现使用内吸药剂1059涂抹棉花的茎干，可以非常经济地取得防治棉蚜虫和红蜘蛛的效果。1059在我国已经在计划生产中。
    目前，各国的科学家正在致力于研究合成更优良、更理想的内吸杀虫药剂。在不久的将来，我们将会在市场上买到这样一种内吸杀虫药剂，把它在果树、蔬菜作物上，随便涂抹上一点，就可以杀死上面的害虫，而对于人畜却安全无害。到那个时候，我们就不再有配药、喷药、使用喷雾器或喷粉等等这些麻烦了。
