    The Southern Daily recently revealed the following incident: In November of last year, Ai Shangzhu, the director of the Fisheries Work Department of the Communist Party of China's Taishan County Committee in Guangdong Province, suddenly had a bright idea one day. He was determined to weave the world's largest fishing net, which would catch an average of 2,000 dan of fish per day. Although this plan was opposed by the representatives of the Guanghai Fishing Port Fishery Production Cooperative, Ai Shangzhu criticized these representatives, calling them "conservative" and "backward." Thus, under his leadership, a massive project that wasted manpower and resources began. This "world's largest fishing net," with a total length of 26,810 Chinese feet (approximately 18 Chinese miles), weighing 33,798 Chinese pounds, taking 42 days and mobilizing 14,132 laborers, was finally successfully woven.

    When this large fishing net, escorted by a large fleet of 65 wooden fishing boats, six motorized sailing boats, and a motorcycle speedboat serving as a command vessel, appeared majestically on the sea off Guanghai Fishing Port, things did not go as beautifully as Ai Shangzhu had imagined. The net was too heavy and cumbersome, making it difficult to operate. It took half a day just to drop the net, and the motorcycle speedboat in command took two hours to patrol a full circle. The commander shouted himself hoarse, but still could not effectively direct the operation. The fish schools took this opportunity to escape without a trace. The large fishing net was cast four times in a row, and the only catch was a few fish that were caught in the mesh and did not have time to escape. The failure did not awaken Ai Shangzhu. He continued to encourage morale and went to sea three more times, but it was still a failure. Now, this "world's largest fishing net" has to "take a long rest." And because of the weaving of the fishing net, the fishermen of the Fishery Cooperative only completed 42% of their production plan for the first quarter. This is, of course, a very serious problem, but even more serious is that Director Ai Shangzhu still says that this is a "technical problem," and that "the large fishing net will definitely be a success and has already achieved results." It can be seen to what extent Ai Shangzhu's subjectivism has developed.

    捕不到鱼的大鱼网
    最近南方日报揭发这样一件事：去年十一月份，中共广东台山县委员会渔业工作部部长艾尚著有一天忽然灵机一动，立意要织造一张世界上最大的鱼网，这张鱼网每天平均可捕鱼二千担。虽然这个计划遭到了广海渔港渔业生产合作社社员代表的反对，但艾尚著把这些代表批评了一顿，说他们“保守”“落后”，于是在他主持下，一个劳民伤财的浩大工作开始了。这张全长26，810市尺（约等于十八华里），重达33，798市斤，费时四十二天，动员了14，132个劳动力的“世界上最大的鱼网”总算织造成功了。
    当这张大鱼网由六十五艘木渔船、六艘机帆船和一艘担任指挥的摩托快船组成的大队护送着，浩浩荡荡出现在广海渔港海面的时候，事情就没有艾尚著想的那样美妙，网身太笨重，操作很困难，单落网就花了半天时间，担任指挥的摩托快船巡视一周就得两个钟头，指挥员声嘶力竭，仍然指挥不好。鱼群也就趁着这个机会跑得无影无踪。大鱼网一连下水四次，全部收获是几条被网眼卡住因而来不及跑掉的鱼儿。失败的事实并没有使艾尚著清醒过来，他继续鼓励士气，一连下海三次，还是一个失败。现在这张“世界上最大的鱼网”只好“长期休养”。而渔业合作社的渔民因为织造渔网，第一季度生产计划只完成了42％。这当然是很严重的问题了，可是更严重的是这位艾尚著部长还说这是“技术问题”，“大鱼网肯定是成功的，而且已经做出了成绩”。可见艾尚著的这种主观主义，已经发展到了什么样的地步。
