Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 17th: A responsible person from the Henan Provincial Flood Control Headquarters spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the issue of the Henan people's victory over the Huai River's first flood this year.

    The spokesperson said: The Huai River's flood season arrived a month earlier this year. The intensity of rainfall in the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River, the vastness of the rainfall area, and the water levels of the Huai River and its tributaries, the Hong River and the Ru River, not only exceeded the guaranteed water levels, but the water levels of the Huai River in Huaibin County and the Hong River in Xincai and Bantai also exceeded the highest water levels of 1954. These are phenomena that have not been seen for decades. Abnormal rainstorms caused abnormal floods, causing the water levels of the Huai River's main stream and tributaries to rise sharply. Under the attack of such an abnormal flood, the Huai River project, built over several years, demonstrated its superior role. The Shimantan, Baisha, Banqiao, Boshan, and Nanwan reservoirs all impounded as much floodwater as possible; the Laowangpo, Jiaotinghu, Wu Songhu, Tonghu, Lida Lake, and Dongda Lake flood storage areas were also successively and appropriately flooded. The reservoirs and flood storage areas impounded a total of more than 1.1 billion cubic meters of floodwater. Among them, the Nanwan Reservoir alone impounded nearly 290 million cubic meters; the Boshan Reservoir closed its gates on the 2nd and impounded 154 million cubic meters of water, which had not been released by the 15th. This greatly reduced the flood peak of the rivers. Secondly, from 1950 to 1955, Henan Province used more than 150 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 1.47 million cubic meters of stone in the Huai River project, raising and widening the dikes; from 1953, the province began a movement to probe for hidden dangers in the dikes, greatly improving the flood control capacity of the dike lines. Thirdly, the party and government organs of Henan Province led the broad masses of people to fight against the flood. The Henan Provincial People's Committee promptly allocated 420,000 yuan for emergency rescue and relief and sent a comfort group; the Xinyang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party transferred 1,000 cadres from special and county-level organs to fight on two fronts, one for flood prevention and rescue, and the other for rescuing disaster-stricken people and wheat. As of the 13th, the Xinyang area had reaped more than 3.76 million mu of wheat, and some counties had almost completed the reaping of wheat. In this tense rescue work, the Huai River Management Committee also sent a steamship to support Huaibin County. As the flood season has just begun, the counties are continuing to strengthen the dikes and plug breaches.

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 17th: The water levels of the main stream and tributaries of the Huai River in Henan Province, except for the tributary Hong River, have all fallen below the guaranteed water level; however, the threat of flooding has not been completely eliminated.

    In order to prevent seepage or landslides of the dikes after being soaked in high water for a long time, slope protection and reinforcement projects are underway along the river at dangerous worksites.

### 河南人民战胜淮河首次洪水  治淮工程在防洪中发挥了优越作用

    河南人民战胜淮河首次洪水
    治淮工程在防洪中发挥了优越作用
    据新华社郑州17日电　河南省防汛指挥部负责人就河南省人民战胜淮河今年首次洪水问题对新华社记者发表谈话。
    这位发言人说：淮河今年汛期提前一个月到来，淮河中上游地区降雨强度之大，降雨面积的广阔，淮河及其支流洪河、汝河的水位不仅超过了保证水位，淮河在淮滨县和洪河在新蔡、班台的水位还都超过1954年的最高水位。这些，都是数十年来所没有的现象。异常的暴雨造成了异常的洪水，使淮河干流和支流的水位急骤上涨。在这样的异常洪水袭击下，几年的治淮工程表现了优越的作用。石漫滩、白沙、板桥、薄山、南湾等水库都拦蓄了可能拦蓄的洪水；老王坡、蛟停湖、吴宋湖、潼湖、李大湖、东大湖等滞蓄洪区也都相继适时地进洪。水库和滞蓄洪区共拦蓄洪水十一亿多公方。其中只南湾水库就拦洪近二亿九千万公方；薄山水库从二日关闭了闸门，拦蓄了一点五四亿公方的水，到十五日还没有放水。这就大大地削减了河流的洪峰。其次，从1950年至1955年，河南省在治淮工程中，只土方就用了一亿五千多万公方，石料147万多公方，加高加宽了堤防；从1953年起，对堤防又开始了锥探隐患的运动，使堤线的防洪能力较前大为提高。第三、河南省的党政机关领导广大人民和洪水斗争。河南省人民委员会及时拨出了四十二万元的抢险和救济费，派出慰问团；中共信阳地方委员会抽调专县机关一千名干部分别两面作战，一面防汛抢险；一面抢救被灾的群众和小麦。至十三日，信阳专区抢收的小麦已达376万多亩，有的县抢收小麦已接近完毕。在这紧张的抢救工作中，治淮委员会也派汽轮支援了淮滨县。由于汛期刚在开始，现在各县正在继续加强堤防，堵复决口。
    据新华社郑州17日电　淮河在河南省境内的干流和支流，除了支流洪河以外，水位都已经回落到保证水位以下；但是洪水的威胁还没有完全解除。
    为了防止堤防在高水位长时间浸泡后的渗漏或滑坡现象，沿河正在对险工进行护坡加固工程。
