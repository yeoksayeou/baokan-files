Talking about the Works of Italian Visiting Artists
Wu Zuoren

The ancient Chinese and Italian people had cultural contact very early on. From the perspective of art, history has recorded more than one instance: In the 16th century, the Italian Matteo Ricci brought Italian paintings to China, and in the 18th century, the Italian painter Giuseppe Castiglione served in the Qing court and was also familiar to Chinese painters. Their works are cherished by the Chinese people. Today, the holding of the "Exhibition of Works by Italian Visiting Artists" is particularly welcome and makes us feel happy because this exhibition marks a new development and new significance in the cultural exchange between the Chinese and Italian people.

Chinese artists and the general public in Beijing are visiting the outstanding works of famous contemporary Italian artists with great enthusiasm. These works have indeed left them with a very deep impression.

When people enter the high-ceilinged exhibition hall of the Chinese Artists Association, they are attracted by a novel and strong force. Italian artists, each with their own artistic vocabulary, reflect the various life encounters of the Italian people, who have a long history, excellent culture, and love of labor and freedom, since the 1940s. This reflection is profound, and we can feel that the artists are full of keen senses.

One of the characteristics of plastic arts is to make people deeply appreciate its inner emotions through the depiction of images. From the exhibited works, we see those contemplative figures (Ann D'Adamanti: sketch "Woman"), galloping horses and knights (A. Sassu: lithograph "Red Horse", gouache "Yellow Horse", oil painting "White Horse"; A. Fabbri: sketch "Struggle", sketch "Knight's Battle"), we understand that the authors, in the face of complex things, use comprehensive and concise brushstrokes to describe their own startled feelings. The lights and shadows in the cafe (A. Sassu: oil painting "Cafe", color lithograph "Cafe") and the southern country women hunched over in the sun-drenched rice fields (Tono Zancanaro: sketch "Woman in the Rice Field") and the workers leaving work (Ann D'Adamanti: gouache "Factory", sketch "Going Home from Work"), these works, with bright colors and concise shapes, vividly and powerfully depict the various different life aspects of the Italian people. Some works do not require much effort, only black and white contrasts and simple lines, to express dazzling light and shadow, shape realistic images, and convey the spirit and ideological activities of the characters, as if to pour out complex emotions of anger and struggle to the viewers (Ann D'Adamanti: sketch "Portrait", sketch "Mother of a Guerrilla").

There are also works that use abstract techniques to express things around life. This abstract painter opposes the ugly war destroying the peace and beauty of human life, while praising the invincibility of the newborn working class, and those who hold high the red flag will establish an order of happy life and prosperity (Gi Dùgado: sketch "Ruins of War", watercolor "May Day").

A. Fabbri's small pottery sculptures are also sculpted with abstract techniques, embodying strong ideas of movement and struggle. Raphael Maffei’s "Simona" and "Eve (II)" and other shapes are thick and full.

Although due to the inconvenience of air transport, the six artists only brought more than one hundred paintings and small pottery sculptures, they have already given us a further understanding of Italian contemporary art and the lives of the Italian people. Through such cultural exchanges between the two peoples, the friendship and mutual understanding between the two peoples will be increasingly enhanced, which will contribute to maintaining world peace.

    谈意大利访华美术家的作品
    吴作人
    古代的中国人民和意大利人民，很早就有了文化上的接触。从美术方面来说，历史上不止一次地记载着实例：十六世纪的意大利人利玛窦，把意大利绘画带到中国，十八世纪在清廷的意大利画家郎世宁，也是为中国画家所熟悉的，他们的作品为中国人民所珍视。今天，“意大利访华美术家作品展览”的举行，其所以特别值得我们欢迎，使我们感到高兴，就是因为这个展出，在中国人民和意大利人民之间的文化交流上，有了新的发展和新的意义。
    在北京的中国艺术家和广大群众，都怀着热烈的心情来看意大利当代的著名美术家们的优秀的作品。这些作品确是给他们留下了极深刻的印象。
    当人们走进中国美术家协会的高朗的展览室，就被一种新颖的、强烈的力量所吸引。意大利艺术家们各以自己的艺术辞汇，反映了具有悠久历史、优秀文化和爱劳动、爱自由的意大利人民在本世纪四十年代以后的种种生活遭遇。这种反映是深刻的，我们可以体会，艺术家们是充满了敏锐的感觉的。
    造形艺术的特性之一，就是通过形象的刻划，令人深切地去体会它内在的感情。从展出作品中，我们看到那些沉思着的人物（安·戴达曼蒂：素描“妇人”）、奔腾的马和骑士（阿·沙梭：石版画“红马”、水粉画“黄马”、油画“白马”；阿·法勃利：素描“斗争”、素描“骑士的战斗”），我们理解到作者在情节复杂的事物面前，运用综合的简约的笔法来描述出他自己的惊愕的感受。咖啡店里的灯光人影（阿·沙梭：油画“咖啡店”、彩色石版画“咖啡店”）和伛身在充满着阳光的水稻田里的南国农妇（托诺·桑加那罗：素描“在稻田里的女人”）以及下工的工人（安·戴达曼蒂：水粉画“工厂”、素描“下工回家”）等，这些作品，都以明快的色彩和简练的造型，生动有力地描出了意大利人民的各种不同的生活面貌。有些作品并不需要多费笔墨，只是黑白对照，朴素的线条，就表现出耀眼的光影，塑造出真实的形象，传达出人物的精神和思想活动，像要对观者倾吐出忿怒和斗争的复杂的情绪（安·戴达曼蒂：素描“人像”、素描“游击队员的母亲”）。
    也有的作品，以抽象的手法来表达生活周遭的事物。这位抽象派的画家，反对丑恶的战争破坏人类生活的平静和美丽，同时歌颂新生的工人阶级之不可侮，那些高举着红旗的人们将要建立起幸福生活的秩序和繁荣（吉·都加多：素描“战争的废墟”、水彩画“五一节”）。
    阿·法勃利的小陶塑也是用抽象的手法来塑造的，它们体现着强烈的运动和斗争的意念。拉斐尔·玛法夫人的“茜梦娜”和“夏娃（之二）”等，造形都是浑厚而充实的。
    虽然由于空运不便，六位艺术家仅仅带来了一百多件绘画和小陶塑，但是已经使我们对意大利当前的艺术和意大利人民的生活有了进一步的认识。通过这样两国人民之间的文化接触，两国人民的友谊和相互了解的日益增进，对维护世界和平将作出贡献。
