Xinhua News Agency, June 26th, London Dispatch: Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammed Ali, in a speech to the Foreign Press Association in London yesterday, welcomed recent developments in relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries, noting that these developments have eased world tensions. He hoped that people would seize upon every action that offers the prospect of resolving international differences on disarmament, the reunification of Germany, and the future of Taiwan.

Ali is in London to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. When discussing Pakistan's relations with China and the Soviet Union, he said that the nature of Pakistan's relations with China is "most friendly," and that relations with the Soviet Union have recently "seen welcome improvement."

Ali denied that Pakistan's participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact was motivated by aggressive intentions, explaining that he believes the sole purpose of these alliances is to "defend peace and promote the welfare of these regions."

In his speech, Ali welcomed the independence of Sudan, Tunisia, and Morocco, and expressed the hope that the Algerian issue could also be "resolved in some satisfactory manner." He praised Britain for granting self-government to Malaya and expressed regret over the failure of talks between Britain and Singapore. He expressed the hope that Britain would resume talks with Singapore.

Ali said that if the West obstructs the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of Asia and Africa, "it will leave burning resentment behind it."

Ali expressed his desire to resolve the Kashmir dispute with India and ease tensions between the two countries, saying: "Because India is our neighbor, we must live together in friendship and cooperation." He reiterated Pakistan's position, demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir.
