To the Editor:

    The ore dressing workshop of Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Mine General Plant began promoting the advanced experience of "rational ball loading of ball mills to improve grinding efficiency" in 1953. By the second half of 1954, the workshop's production situation had improved. As a result, the leaders became complacent and relaxed their work in promoting advanced experiences.

    At that time, the quality of iron ball casting was very poor. The ball casting workers had raised rationalization proposals to improve the work, but the workshop leaders did not pay serious attention to them. Last year, workers learned the advanced experience of using tailing automatic samplers to calculate powder selection recovery rate and ore dressing ratio. Although the leaders made two samplers at that time, they did not help the workers learn how to use them. As a result, the samplers often broke down, and no one was responsible for repairing them. Later, they simply stopped using them. The workshop leaders also did not pay attention to some good operating experiences in their own unit. The crushing section was a weak link in the workshop, and many shifts and groups often failed to complete the ore supply task. Only Xu Chunyue's shift, because of its scientific operating methods, often exceeded the quota. Many workers spontaneously learned from Xu Chunyue's shift's operating experience and asked the workshop leaders to summarize and promote this shift's experience. However, the workshop leaders took a cold attitude toward the workers' enthusiasm.

    Not only were new advanced experiences not promoted, but the advanced experience of "rational ball loading of ball mills," which had been promoted earlier, could not be implemented because no one was responsible for it. For example, it was originally stipulated that each ball mill should have new balls loaded and replaced once a month, but some shifts and groups did not implement this regulation. For example, two ball mills in the second ore selection section had only been loaded and replaced once since last July, so the grinding efficiency was greatly reduced. There were also some shifts and groups that did not load balls according to the prescribed ratio of large and small balls, and therefore could not achieve rational ball loading. However, the workshop leaders had never paid attention to these problems. Promoting advanced experience is a regular task. The Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Mine General Plant should educate the leaders of the ore dressing workshop to change their current attitude.

### 本溪矿山总厂选矿车间推广先进经验松了劲

    本溪矿山总厂选矿车间推广先进经验松了劲编辑同志：
    本溪钢铁公司矿山总厂选矿车间在1953年开始，推广了“球磨机合理装球、提高磨矿效率”的先进经验。到1954年下半年，车间生产情况 f有了好转。于是，领导人就沾沾自喜起来，放松了推广先进经验的工作。
    当时，铁球铸造质量很不好，铸球工人曾经提出过改进工作的合理化建议，但是车间领导方面却不加以认真研究。去年工人们学习了用尾矿自动取样器计算选粉回收率和选矿比的先进经验。当时领导人虽然制作了两台取样器，但是却不帮助工人学习使用，结果取样器经常出故障，又无人负责修理，后来干脆不用了。车间领导人对本单位有些好的操作经验也是不重视的。碎矿工段是车间的薄弱环节，许多班、组老是不能完成上矿任务，只有徐春悦班因为操作方法科学，经常超过定额。许多工人都自发地学习徐春悦班的操作经验，并且要求车间领导方面把这个班的经验总结推广。但是，车间领导人对工人们的这种积极性抱了冷淡的态度。
    不但是新的先进经验没有推广，就是原来推广了的“球磨机合理装球”的先进经验也因为无人负责而不能贯彻执行了。例如，原来规定每台球磨机每月要装换一次新球，但是有些班、组不按规定执行，像二选工段有两台球磨机从去年七月到现在只装换过一次球，因此磨矿效率大大降低了。还有一些班、组不按规定的大球、小球配合比装球，因而不能做到合理装球。但是，车间领导方面对这些问题也一直不过问。推广先进经验是件经常性的工作，本溪钢铁公司矿山总厂应该教育选矿车间的领导人改变目前的这种态度。
