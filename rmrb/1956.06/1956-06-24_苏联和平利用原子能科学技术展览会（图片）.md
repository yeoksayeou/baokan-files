Soviet Scientific and Technological Exhibition on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy

In the section on atomic raw materials and their detection and exploration, you can see uranium ore and mineral samples, instruments for prospecting atomic raw material sources, a luminescent darkroom, and other materials. Above: This visitor is using a radiation meter used in mines to test the radioactivity of uraninite. This radiation meter is used for quantitative measurement of α and Β rays in mountain tunnels and field surveys.

The Soviet Scientific and Technological Exhibition on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy is on display in our capital. This exhibition vividly demonstrates that the peaceful use of atomic energy has been widely applied in the Soviet national economy.

The exhibition hall is divided into seven parts: the introduction hall, atomic raw materials and their detection and exploration, atomic nuclear reactors and atomic power plants, nuclear and radiation chemistry, the application of radioactive isotopes in industry, the application of radioactive isotopes in medicine, and the application of radioactive isotopes in agriculture and biology.

Left: Documents and giant pictures of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the development of the peaceful use of atomic energy exhibited in the introduction hall.

Left: This is a model of an experimental heavy water reactor in the atomic nuclear reactor and atomic power plant section.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Zhang Wentian, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, are viewing the model of the first 5,000-kilowatt atomic power plant. The second person from the left is Academician Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to China.

The narrator in the nuclear and radiation chemistry section is explaining to two young people who are keen on studying chemistry how to observe the changes in the properties of matter after being subjected to high-energy radiation.

The huge penetrating power of γ-rays is widely used to detect defects in ferrous metals, non-ferrous metal castings, and welded joints of metal structures. These visitors are looking at a γ-ray flaw detector. This flaw detector uses radioactive isotope cobalt (eo60) as the radiation source. The γ-rays emitted from the radiation source can penetrate steel plates up to 500 mm thick. The application of γ-ray flaw detection method can ensure that the finished products have good quality.

Many scientists from Beijing visited the exhibition. Many of them had cordial conversations with Soviet scientists. This photo is a group photo of Chinese and Soviet scientists after a conversation. Behind them is a huge chart, which introduces the countries and cities that regularly receive isotope supplies.

The narrator in the section on the application of radioactive isotopes in agriculture and biology is pointing to a chart showing the research on fertilization using fertilizers containing radioactive isotopes, telling the audience: The white dots at the roots indicate the position of fertilization, and the other part of the chart illustrates the relationship between the fertilization position, its soil factors, and the fertilizer effect.

These two photos are of a child. The left photo was taken when he was suffering from hemangioma of the upper right eyelid: The right photo was taken when the hemangioma of the child had been cured after treatment with radioactive cobalt application.

Left: This is a γ-ray therapy machine equipped with 400 grams radium equivalent of radioactive cobalt. The main purpose of this treatment machine is to treat malignant tumors of deep internal organs. The great achievements of the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy and the great plan to benefit the people with the peaceful use of atomic energy attract the yearning and admiration of every audience. The exhibition receives many visitors every day. The above picture is a part of the exhibition hall.

    苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会
    在原子原料及其探测和勘查部分，可以看到铀矿和矿物样品、原子原料矿源的勘探仪器、发光暗室及其他材料。上图：这位观众用矿坑内用的辐射仪试听铀石的放射力。这种辐射仪用于山地坑道和野外普查?和Β射线定量测量。
    苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会，在我国首都展出。这个展览会生动地表明，和平利用原子能在苏联的国民经济中已经被广泛地应用。
    展览馆内分为七大部分，即序馆，原子原料及其探测和勘查，原子核反应堆及原子能发电站，核子和辐射化学，放射性同位素在工业方面的应用，放射性同位素在医学方面的应用，和放射性同位素在农业和生物学方面应用。
    左图：在序馆中展出的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于发展和平利用原子能的文件和巨幅图片。
    左图：这是在原子核反应堆及原子能发电站部分的一个叫实验重水反应堆的模型。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若和外交部副部长张闻天等在看第一座5，000瓩原子能发电站模型。左起第二人是苏联驻我国大使尤金院士。
    核子和辐射化学部分的讲解员，正向两个热心于研究化学的青年，解说如何观察到受高能量辐射作用后的物质的性质变化状况。
    ?射线的巨大穿透力被广泛的用来发现黑色金属，有色金属铸件及金属结构焊缝中的缺陷等。这些观众正在看?探伤器。这种探伤器用放射性同位素钴（eo60）做射源。从射源放出来的?射线可以穿透厚度为五百公厘以下的钢板。应用?探伤的方法可以保证出产成品具有良好的质量。
    北京的许多科学家都参观了展览会。其中有不少的人同苏联科学家进行了亲切的交谈。这张照片是中苏科学家在一次交谈后的合影。在他们的后面是一幅巨大的图表，这幅图表是介绍经常接受到同位素供应的国家和城市。
    放射性同位素在农业和生物学方面应用部分的讲解员，指着运用含有放射性同位素的肥料进行施肥研究的图表告诉观众：根部的白点是表示施肥的位置，图表的另外一部分是说明施肥位置及其土壤因素和肥料效果的相互关系。
    这两张照片是一个小孩子。左图是他正患右上眼睑血管瘤时拍的照片：右图是这个小孩子经放射性钴敷贴法治疗后血管瘤已经痊愈时拍的照片。
    左图：这是装有400克镭当量的放射性钴的?射线治疗机。这种治疗机的用途，主要就是治疗深部的内脏器官的恶性肿瘤。苏联和平利用原子能方面的科学技术的重大成就，及和平利用原子能造福人民的伟大计划，吸引着每个观众的向往和钦敬。展览会每天要接待许多观众，上图是展览馆的一部分。
