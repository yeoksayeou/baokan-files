Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, June 16th. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway today laid tracks to Yumen East Station, 792 kilometers from Lanzhou. The track-laying project is now turning to continue towards the railway branch line leading to the Yumen Oilfield.

Yumen East Station is the connecting station between the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway trunk line and the branch line leading to the Yumen Oilfield. In the future, tank cars from the Yumen Oilfield branch line will be marshaled here and then transported eastward. Tens of thousands of tons of construction materials will also be transferred here to the Yumen Oilfield.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, June 14th. Various preparations for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway's access to the Yumen Oilfield are being intensified. The days of directly hauling large quantities of petroleum from the motherland's first natural petroleum base by train are approaching day by day.

Recently, eight large locomotives have been transferred from the Northeast. Locomotive fire screens and tank cars for transporting crude oil are also fully prepared. Communication lines to the Yumen Oilfield are being erected; some stations are also installing dispatch telephones. In order to supply water for the locomotives, water supply pipelines are being installed at Yumen East Station and Yumen South Station. A temporary pumping station has recently been established at the head of the Beida River Bridge. The transportation management department of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has transferred sufficient railway transportation business personnel from Lanzhou, Zhangye and other places. They will soon be working at various stations between Qingshui and the Yumen Oilfield.

A branch line connecting the Yumen Oilfield to the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has had most of its bridges, culverts, and roadbeds constructed. The construction of stations, platforms, and sidings is now being accelerated. The dedicated railway line leading to the oil depot has also been started in advance. In the future, crude oil from the Yumen Oilfield will be loaded and transported out from here.

    兰新铁路修到玉门东站
    石油直接用火车东运的日子近了
    新华社玉门16日电　兰新铁路在今天铺轨到离兰州792公里的玉门东站。现在铺轨工程正转向通到玉门油矿区的铁路支线继续前进。
    玉门东站是兰新铁路干线和通往玉门油矿支线的连接站。今后来自玉门油矿支线的油罐车，都要在这里进行编组，然后东运。成千上万吨的建筑器材，也将由这里转运到玉门油矿。
    新华社兰州14日电　兰新铁路通车玉门油矿的各项准备工作，正在加紧进行。用火车直接从祖国第一个天然石油基地拉出大量石油的日子，一天天接近了。
    最近，从东北调来了八台大型机车。机车防火网和装运原油的油罐车也全部准备好。通往玉门油矿的通讯线路正在架设中；有的车站还在安装调度电话。为了供给机车用水，玉门东站和玉门南站正在安装给水管路。一座临时扬水站最近已经在北大河大桥桥头建立起来。兰新铁路的运输管理部门从兰州、张掖等地抽调了足够的铁路运输业务人员。他们很快就要进入清水到玉门油矿间各站工作。
    从玉门油矿接连兰新铁路的一条支线，大部分的桥涵和路基已经筑好，现在正赶修车站及站台和股道。通向油库的铁路专用线也已经提前开工。将来玉门油矿的原油，就从这里装车外运。
