The State Statistical Bureau has published a communiqué on the results of the 1955 national economic plan execution. As can be seen from this communiqué, China's total industrial output value and the output of grain and cotton all exceeded the national plan in 1955. Among the 45 major industrial products listed in the Five-Year Plan, 37 completed or overfulfilled the national plan. After reducing non-productive investment and lowering project costs in the total investment in capital construction, the state's investment plan was still close to completion. The plans to reduce the cost of industrial products and the cost of construction and installation projects were also completed. This communiqué shows that in the third year of the first Five-Year Plan, the Chinese people have made significant achievements again. These achievements will encourage the Chinese people to continue to push forward the cause of socialist construction on the existing basis.

In 1955, the growth rate of China's agricultural production was relatively fast. The growth rate of grain output was 9%, which greatly exceeded the growth rates of 1954 (1.6%) and 1953 (1.8%). Cotton output increased by 43% compared with 1954, and also increased by 16% compared with the bumper harvest year of 1952, which reversed the situation of continuous cotton production reduction in 1953 and 1954.

However, with the exception of agriculture, the growth rate of other sectors of the national economy was relatively slow. In 1955, the growth rate of the total national industrial output value only reached 8%. The growth rate of total investment in capital construction (workload calculated in currency) only reached 9%. The growth rate of railway freight turnover only reached 5%. The growth rate of total retail sales of social commodities only reached 3%. The growth rate of several economic sectors other than agriculture in 1955 was the lowest in the years since liberation. The reasons for this low growth mainly come from two aspects: on the one hand, the Yangtze River, Huai River area and Hebei Province suffered particularly severe floods in 1954, and agricultural production did not complete the planned target, which brought many adverse effects to the development of the national economy in 1955, especially the development of light industry; on the other hand, there was a fairly serious right-leaning conservative thinking in various aspects at that time, which hindered the rapid development of the national economy.

In the second half of 1955, a significant change occurred in China's economic situation. This was because the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao criticized and corrected the right-leaning conservative thinking in the agricultural cooperativization movement, and then criticized and corrected the right-leaning conservative thinking in many other tasks, thereby setting off a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Agricultural production also achieved a bumper harvest this year. This not only accelerated the speed of socialist transformation and increased the speed of agricultural production increase, but also made it possible to expand the scale of industrial construction, greatly accelerate the speed of industrial production, and correspondingly accelerate the development of transportation, commerce, science, culture, education, health and other undertakings, so a new upsurge began to appear in various sectors of the national economy.

The results of the 1955 national economic plan execution clearly tell us that to give priority to the development of heavy industry, we must simultaneously ensure the corresponding development of agriculture and light industry, especially we must strive to overcome the backward state of agricultural production, otherwise the development of the entire national economy will be affected by it. At present, the total industrial output value in China that requires agricultural raw materials accounts for about 40%. The growth of industrial production largely depends on the growth of agricultural production. In 1952, agriculture had a bumper harvest, and the growth rate of consumer goods production in 1953 reached 28% (production means production was 37%). In 1953, especially in 1954, agricultural production suffered natural disasters, and the supply of agricultural raw materials was insufficient. The growth rate of consumer goods production in 1954 only reached 14% (production means production was 20%), while the growth rate of consumer goods production in 1955 was even slower, only reaching 1% (production means production was 17%). In 1955, cotton yarn production decreased by nearly 630,000 pieces compared to 1954, cotton cloth decreased by 19 million bolts, cigarettes decreased by more than 160,000 cases, and gunny bags decreased by about 6.46 million pieces. Due to the reduction in the production of these four products, the national industrial growth rate in 1955 was reduced by about 4%. The slow growth of agriculture and light industry cannot but affect the development of trade and other related economic undertakings, and also affect the source of national income and construction funds to a certain extent. In the second half of 1955, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao timely solved the fundamental problem of developing agricultural production, tens of thousands of farmers participated in agricultural production cooperatives, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and the situation of separation between agricultural production and industrial production began to be reversed, thus a new upsurge in the national economy followed, and a broad road was opened for the rapid advancement of socialist construction.

On the basis of last year's bumper harvest and the high tide of socialist transformation, China's national economy this year is tending to be a comprehensive upsurge. Since the beginning of the year, enterprises in various departments and regions have generally launched socialist labor competitions, and tens of thousands of advanced producers have emerged in the competitions, and many technical and economic norms have been continuously broken through. After the farmers were organized, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and most of the spring plowing plans were overfulfilled. If there are no particularly major disasters, a bumper harvest of summer crops is expected this year. In terms of socialist transformation, more than 90% of farmers have now joined agricultural production cooperatives, of which 61% have joined advanced cooperatives, and 78% of organized handicraftsmen have been reached. Capitalist industry and commerce nationwide has basically implemented overall public-private partnership, and is carrying out reorganization work in a step-by-step manner. This marks that socialist production relations, not only in industry, but also in agriculture and commerce, not only in cities, but also in vast rural areas, are already in an absolutely dominant position. All of this makes the people of the whole country have good conditions to strive for comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of this year's national plan.

However, in the current socialist labor competition movement, some production enterprises and construction units only pay attention to "more" and "faster", and do not pay the same attention to "good" and "saving". Many production enterprises and construction units continue to experience phenomena such as reduced quality, overspending of costs, and increased accidents. This situation must be thoroughly corrected, otherwise it will bring intolerable losses to the country.

With the acceleration of production and construction undertakings across the country, some new imbalances have also emerged in the national economy, especially the supply of certain raw materials is relatively tight. However, the production plans for important products such as steel and steel materials have not been fully completed in the past few months. Therefore, it is required that all economic departments must strengthen the leadership of the production increase movement and strive to maintain a balance in all aspects. In terms of industrial production, all products that are in short supply should strive to increase production, and for all products with insufficient raw materials, raw materials should be used sparingly to ensure the completion of the production plan. In terms of capital construction, attention should be paid to avoiding the disconnection between equipment and raw material supply and construction and installation projects. For certain raw materials that are in relatively tight supply, it is not only necessary to vigorously increase production and use them sparingly, but also to strive to check inventory and conduct allocation to meet the urgent needs of national construction.

Comprehensively and overfulfilling this year's national plan is of great significance for completing and overfulfilling the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. From now to the end of the year, there is only a little more than half a year left. The tasks before us are very heavy, requiring us to redouble our efforts, give full play to all positive factors, overcome weak links, and comprehensively and overfulfill this year's national plan, so that the country's construction cause can accelerate forward.

### 积极努力，完成今年的国家计划

    积极努力，完成今年的国家计划
    国家统计局公布了关于1955年度国民经济计划执行结果的公报。从这个公报中可以看出，1955年我国工业总产值、粮食和棉花的产量都超额完成了国家计划。列入五年计划的45种主要工业产品中，有37种完成或超额完成了国家计划。在基本建设投资总额中削减了非生产性投资、降低了工程造价之后，国家的投资计划仍然接近完成。降低工业产品成本和建筑安装工程成本的计划也都完成了。这个公报表明：在第一个五年计划的第三年里，我国人民又取得了重大的成就。这些成就，将鼓舞我国人民在现有的基础上把社会主义建设事业继续推向前进。
    1955年我国农业生产的增长速度是比较快的。粮食产量的增长速度为9％，大大超过1954年（1.6％）和1953年（1.8％）的增长速度。棉花产量比1954年增加了43％，比大丰收的1952年也增加了16％，这就扭转了1953年和1954年棉花连续减产的局面。
    但是，除农业以外，国民经济其他部门的增长速度是比较慢的。1955年全国工业总产值的增长速度只达到8％。基本建设投资总额（按货币计算的工作量）的增长速度只达到9％。铁路货物周转量的增长速度只达到5％。社会商品零售总额的增长速度只达到3％。除农业以外的几个经济部门1955年的增长速度，是解放以来几年中增长速度最低的一年。其所以低的原因主要来自两个方面：一方面是1954年长江、淮河地区和河北省遭受了特大的洪水灾害，农业生产没有完成预定的计划，这给1955年国民经济的发展，特别是轻工业的发展带来了许多不利的影响；另一方面是当时在各个方面存在着相当严重的右倾保守思想，使国民经济迅速的发展受到了阻碍。
    1955年下半年，我国的经济情况发生了一个显著的变化。这是由于党中央和毛主席批判和纠正了农业合作化运动中的右倾保守思想，接着又批判和纠正了其他许多工作中的右倾保守思想，从而掀起了农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造高潮。这一年的农业生产也获得了丰收。这就不仅加快了社会主义改造的速度，提高了农业增产的速度，而且使工业建设的规模也可能扩大，使工业生产的速度也可能大大地加快，使运输业、商业、科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业的发展也相应地加快，因而国民经济各部门也就开始出现了一个新的高涨。
    1955年国民经济计划执行的结果清楚地告诉了我们，要优先发展重工业，必须同时保证农业和轻工业有相应的发展，尤其是必须努力克服农业生产的落后状态，否则，整个国民经济的发展就要受到它的影响。目前我国工业总产值中，需要农产原料的工业总产值占40％左右。工业生产的增长在很大程度上取决于农业生产的增长。1952年农业丰收，1953年消费品生产的增长速度就达到28％（生产资料生产为37％），1953年，特别是1954年农业生产遭受自然灾害，农产原料供应不足，1954年消费品生产的增长速度就只达到14％（生产资料生产为20％），而1955年消费品生产的增长速度更为缓慢，只达到1％（生产资料生产为17％）。1955年棉纱比1954年减产将近63万件，棉布减产1，900万匹，卷烟减产16万多箱，麻袋减产约646万条。由于这四种产品的减产，就使1955年全国工业增长速度降低了约4％。农业和轻工业部门增长得慢，就不能不影响贸易和其它有关经济事业的发展，并使国家收入和建设资金的来源也受到一定的影响。1955年下半年，党中央和毛主席及时地解决了发展农业生产这一根本性的问题，成千成万的农民参加了农业生产合作社，他们的生产积极性空前高涨，开始扭转了农业生产与工业生产相脱节的局面，因而也就接着出现了国民经济的新高涨，并为社会主义建设的迅速前进开辟了宽广的道路。
    在去年农业丰收和社会主义改造高潮的基础上，今年我国的国民经济更趋于全面的高涨。年初以来，各部门、各地区的企业普遍地开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，竞赛中涌现了成千成万的先进生产者，许多技术经济定额不断被突破。农民组织起来以后，生产情绪空前高涨，春耕计划大多超额完成，如果没有特大的灾情，今年夏季作物可望丰收。在社会主义改造方面，目前已经有90％以上的农户参加了农业生产合作社，其中参加高级社的农户达到61％，组织起来的手工业者已经达到78％。全国资本主义工商业已经基本上实行了全行业公私合营，并且在有步骤地进行着改组工作。这就标志着社会主义的生产关系，不仅在工业中，而且在农业和商业中，不仅在城市中，而且在广大农村中，都已经处于绝对优势的地位了。所有这些，就使得全国人民有良好的条件来争取全面完成和超额完成今年的国家计划。
    但是，在目前的社会主义劳动竞赛运动中，还有一些生产企业和建设单位只注意了“多”和“快”，没有同样地注意“好”和“省”。有许多生产企业和建设单位继续发生质量降低、成本超支、事故增多的现象，这种情况必须彻底纠正，否则将给国家带来不可容忍的损失。
    在全国生产和建设事业速度加快的情况下，国民经济中还产生了一些新的不平衡的现象，特别是某些原材料的供应比较紧张。但过去几月钢和钢材等重要产品的产量计划却没有全部完成。因此，要求各经济部门必须加强对增产运动的领导，努力保持各方面的平衡。在工业生产方面，凡供应不足的产品都应努力增产，凡原材料不足的产品，则应节约使用原材料，来保证完成生产计划。在基本建设方面，要注意避免设备和原材料供应与建筑安装工程间的脱节。对某些供应比较紧张的原材料，不仅需要大力增加生产，节约使用，同时需要努力清查库存、进行调剂，以满足国家建设的迫切需要。
    全面和超额完成今年的国家计划，对提前和超额完成第一个五年计划具有十分重要的意义。从现在到年底，只有半年多一点的时间了，摆在我们面前的任务是很繁重的，要求我们加倍努力，充分发挥一切积极因素，克服薄弱环节，全面地超额地完成今年的国家计划，使国家的建设事业加速向前发展。
