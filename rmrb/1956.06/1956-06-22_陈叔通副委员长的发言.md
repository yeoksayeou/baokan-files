I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Model Charter (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report.

1956 is the year when the socialist transformation achieved a decisive victory. Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report proves that the superiority of the socialist economic system has become increasingly clear in our country and is demonstrated by irrefutable facts. The 1956 national budget and the model charter of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives are major events in our country's progress on the road of socialist revolution. I propose that the congress examine and approve the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, as well as the model charter (draft) of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives.

In his report, Vice Premier Li Xiannian criticized the shortcomings of some state-owned industries and state-owned commercial enterprises. In Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on "The Socialist Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's speech on "The Implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy in Our Country," and the speeches of leaders from other departments, criticisms were also made of the shortcomings and errors that had already occurred, which serve as a lesson for future improvement. Regarding this aspect, I would like to offer a few suggestions.

	First, on the issue of preventing errors

Our undertakings are all new, something our predecessors have never done before. In the progress of our undertakings, we lack experience, and errors are unavoidable. We have made some mistakes in the past, and we will continue to make mistakes in the future. However, all our mistakes are errors of progress, not errors of regression. As long as errors are discovered, we can correct them in time, which is something everyone can see. There is an old Chinese saying: "No one is perfect." Such a sage has never been born since ancient times, and will not be born in the future. This is superstition, this is fantasy. Only as the ancient saying goes: "To err is human, to correct is divine." This is the attitude we should adopt at present.

However, no matter what kind of error it is, it is ultimately a loss to the country and the people. Although it is impossible for us to avoid errors, we should make as few errors as possible, and we should prevent errors from happening as much as possible. Errors that have already occurred should not be repeated again and again; errors that have been discovered should be corrected in time and as thoroughly as possible. This is also the spirit we must grasp in our work.

Some errors are unavoidable and cannot be prevented in advance; but some errors are foreseeable and can be prevented in advance. For example, when the high tide of the overall public-private partnership came, it was inevitable that our work would be rough and some shortcomings and errors would occur in the work to carry out such a wide, rapid, and inexperienced change. Even if we could foresee these shortcomings and errors in advance, it would be difficult to completely prevent them. However, while we are criticizing conservative thinking, we should consider the aspect of impatience and rashness; while we are calling for increased grain production, we should pay attention to economic crops and other sideline production. Here, I am reminded of what Chairman Mao said: "A couplet has two scrolls; one scroll does not make a couplet." Is it true that hanging one scroll first will create greater momentum, while hanging both scrolls at the same time will dilute the first scroll? In my opinion, it is better to hang both scrolls at the same time; otherwise, errors will occur. Does hanging both scrolls mean that no mistakes will be made at all? No. But at least it can reduce some errors.

Some errors, although criticized and corrected, will still be repeated in our work with the same nature, thus causing the country to suffer losses again and again. Such examples are also frequently encountered. For example, in industrial production, only paying attention to quantity while ignoring quality; in commerce, the problem of goods being out of stock during the season and being overstocked after the season; these problems have been repeatedly criticized by the central government, but the errors are still repeated. I believe that even if repetition is excusable, the degree of error should be reduced.

Furthermore, after discovering errors, we should find out the causes of the errors and quickly overcome and correct them. This is also an effective way to reduce errors. For example, the various departments of our country should be an organic whole, requiring mutual cooperation and mutual support. If there are uncoordinated working relationships between the relevant departments, it will inevitably affect the completion of the national plan. However, at present, there is a not very coordinated "industry-trade relationship" between certain local industrial departments and certain commercial departments. There are many problems, generally involving product quality, cost prices, acceptance standards, the quality of raw materials, the trial production of new products, and the coordination of production, supply, and sales plans, etc. It also involves the ideological style of cadres. Regarding the understanding of these issues, certain local industrial departments and certain commercial departments have different views. Some units do not support each other, but shirk responsibility to each other; some only consider the interests of their own units, without considering the interests of other units; some only consider local interests, without considering the overall interests of the country. This situation has been discovered in various places, and some are quite serious. It also involves the relationship between the central government and local governments. It has been exposed and criticized more than once in the newspapers, but the problem has not been well resolved. I suggest that the relevant departments study and solve it from the system, from the reform of the system, and from the ideological education of cadres, so as to better complete the national plan.

In addition, the quality of raw materials will inevitably affect the quality of finished products. To produce qualified finished products, there must be qualified raw materials. The quality of a factory's equipment will also affect the quality of its products. At present, the machinery and equipment of many joint ventures are relatively old, and the working conditions are relatively poor. If we want to improve product quality, we should consider the improvement of the original equipment. Furthermore, the lack of technical personnel in joint ventures is also quite common. This also affects the improvement of product quality. Therefore, how to concentrate technical personnel and uniformly allocate their use has become an urgent issue at present. All of this shows that we should create conditions in all aspects to improve product quality, so that the problem of quality decline will no longer continue to occur as much as possible. It is not enough to merely point out errors and shortcomings.

	Second, on the issue of learning from advanced experience and independent thinking

If our country is to carry out socialist construction, it must rely on the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In the era when the world is divided into two major camps, only the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are willing to help us technically and materially, and support us, so that we have the opportunity to learn from their advanced experience, and sincerely teach us to master their advanced technology. In fact, we have benefited greatly from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. It is countless, inexhaustible.

Learning from advanced experience should be combined with the actual conditions of our country, rather than mechanically and dogmatically transplanting it. That is to say, in the process of learning from advanced experience, we must have the ability to think independently and have the spirit of hard study. We must further study from the basis of advanced experience and make creations. And we must explore our heritage. Not all heritage is good, but there are many good ones. Only in this way can we push forward advanced experience, can we contribute to the socialist camp, and can we live up to the expectations of the Soviet Union.

Of course, there are some people who cannot think independently and use this term as an excuse to refuse to learn from advanced experience, which is very bad.

Some people believe that the Soviet Union's advanced experience cannot be wrong. Even if they take a detour by doing things according to the Soviet Union's advanced experience, they will not be criticized. This is called "advanced backing". With this "backing", they are unwilling to accept newer technologies, nor are they willing to support further creation and invention. This is one situation.

There are also some people who underestimate the ability of others to think independently, and they do not understand new things themselves, but they do not believe in others, so they are only willing to accept the Soviet Union's advanced experience and are unwilling to support the achievements of others' independent thinking. This is another situation.

All of these situations can become obstacles to independent thinking. As long as these obstacles still exist, the initiative of independent thinking will not receive sufficient support and encouragement.

Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union does not mean refusing to absorb the scientific knowledge of countries with different systems, even enemies. We should be good at cultivating the ability to think independently. As long as it is advanced science, we must learn it with an open mind, absorb it, and serve the construction of socialism.

	Finally, please allow me to say a few words on the issue of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

I fully agree with Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on "The Socialist Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce." This speech shows the government's concern and care for industrialists and businessmen. The interest rate is set very generously, and various methods are considered very carefully and thoughtfully, fully in line with the policy of peaceful transformation, and solve the main problems existing among industrialists and businessmen at present.

The government has always been very concerned about the lives of industrialists and businessmen. After the overall public-private partnership, the state adopted the method of keeping the original salaries unchanged, thus maintaining the lives of private personnel and stabilizing people's minds. Later, after learning that some private personnel and small vendors had certain difficulties in their lives, the government gave them necessary consideration in terms of treatment and business. Now the government will give further arrangements for the lives and businesses of small vendors; will implement reasonable adjustments to the wages of private personnel; and has considered reasonable methods for the medical treatment of private personnel. This is a great encouragement to industrialists and businessmen. At present, the problem of the difficult lives of some industrialists and businessmen urgently needs to be solved, rather than a problem that can be solved leisurely. On the one hand, it is hoped that the relevant departments will speed up the adjustment of wages and benefits; at the same time, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is also considering mutual aid methods to provide reference for the relevant departments.

At present, the public-private working relationship in joint ventures is generally normal. But there are still some problems. Improving the public-private working relationship requires a certain process. On the one hand, it is necessary to educate the workers, public representatives, and capitalists, and at the same time, it is necessary to establish a certain working system in joint ventures. This has been made very clear in Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech. In the future, the local Minjian Associations and Federations of Industry and Commerce must more closely and proactively cooperate with the government to actively promote private personnel to strengthen their studies and carry out self-transformation. Our industrialists and businessmen should also actively improve production and management under the leadership of the public representatives and with the help of the workers, and transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers in the practice of specific businesses.

专栏：

    陈叔通副委员长的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”，和彭真副委员长的工作报告。
    1956年是社会主义改造取得决定性胜利的一年。李先念副总理的报告证明了社会主义经济制度的优越性，已在我们国家里日益鲜明地、以无可争辩的事实显示出来了。1956年国家预算和高级农业生产合作社示范章程是我们国家在社会主义革命的迈进道路上的一件大事。我建议大会，将1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，以及高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案），予以审查通过。
    李先念副总理在报告中批评了某些国营工业和国营商业的缺点。陈云副总理“关于私营工商业的社会主义改造问题”的发言中，李富春副总理“关于我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划的执行情况”的发言中，以及其他部门的领导人发言中，对于已经发生过的缺点和错误，也都提出了批评，这都是为以后改进的殷鉴。关于这方面，我想提一点意见。
      第一、关于防止错误的问题
    我们的事业都是新的，是我们的前人所没有做过的。在事业的进展中，我们缺乏经验，不可避免地会发生错误。过去我们发生过一些错误，今后还会继续发生错误。但是我们所有的错误，是进步中的错误，而不是倒退中的错误。只要错误被发现出来了，我们就能够及时改正，这也是大家所能看到的。中国有一句古话：“人非圣贤，孰能无过”。这种圣贤自古以来没有降生，今后也不会降生，这是迷信，这是幻想。只有如古训所说的：“过而能改，善莫大焉”。这才是我们当前应该采取的态度。
    但是，不论任何性质的错误，对于国家和人民来说，究竟是一种损失。我们虽然不可能不发生错误，但应该尽可能少错，要尽可能事前防止错误的发生；已经发生过的错误，不要一再地重复；已经发现了的错误，要及时改正，又要尽可能改得彻底。这也是我们在工作上必须掌握的精神。
    有一些错误，是不可避免的，是没有法子进行事前防止的；但有一些错误是可以预见得到的，是可以事前防止的。比如，像全行业公私合营高潮到来的时候，要进行这样一种广泛迅速而缺乏经验的改变，我们的工作不可避免地会粗糙一些，并在工作中会发生一些缺点和错误。即使我们能够在事前估计到这种缺点和错误，也是很难完全防止的。但是，在我们进行批判保守思想的同时，是应该考虑到急躁冒进的一面的；在我们号召粮食增产的同时，是应该注意到经济作物及其他副业生产的一面的。这里我想到了毛主席说的：“对联是两幅的，一幅不成联。”是不是先挂出一幅，劲头来得大，两幅同时挂出，会把第一幅冲淡呢？我的意见，还是两幅同时挂出来好，不然，就会发生错误。两幅都挂出来，是不是绝对不会犯错误呢？不是的。但是至少可以减少一些错误。
    有一些错误，虽然经过批评和纠正，但是同一性质的错误，还会在我们的工作中重复发生，因而使国家一再遭受损失。这种事例也是经常碰到的。比如，在工业生产上只注意数量，而忽视质量问题；在商业上逢季脱销、过季积压问题；这些问题已经中央一再提出批评，但错误还是重复发生。我认为，重复发生即使是情有可原，但错误的程度应该有所减轻。
    还有，在发现错误以后，我们应该把造成错误的原因找出来，迅速地加以克服和纠正，这也是减少错误的一种有效方法。比如，我们国家的各个部门应该是一个有机的整体，要求互相配合，互相支援。如果有关部门之间存在着不协调的工作关系，必然会影响国家计划的完成。但目前某些地方工业部门与某些商业部门之间就存在着不很协调的“工贸关系”，其中问题不少，一般牵涉到产品质量、成本价格、验收标准、原料好坏、新产品的试制和产供销计划的配合等等方面，也牵涉到干部思想作风问题。对于这些问题的理解，某些地方工业部门与某些商业部门各有不同的看法。有些单位不是互相支援，而是互相扯皮；有的只打算本单位的利益，而不考虑其他单位的利益；有的只打算局部的利益，而不考虑国家的整体利益。这种情况，各地都有发现，有的还相当严重。而且还牵涉到中央与地方的关系。在报上也曾经不止一次地加以揭露和批判，但问题还没有很好地得到解决。我建议有关部门，从体制上，从制度改革上，从干部的思想教育上，进行研究和解决，从而更好地完成国家的计划。
    此外，如原料的质量必然会影响成品的质量。要生产合格的成品，就必须有合乎规格的原料。一个工厂设备的好坏，也会影响产品的质量。目前很多合营工厂的机器设备是比较陈旧的，劳动条件是比较差的。要提高产品质量的话，就应该考虑到原有设备的改进问题。还有，在合营企业中，缺乏技术人员的情况也是相当普遍的。这也影响到产品质量的提高。因此，如何集中技术人员，统一调配使用，就成为目前迫切的课题。这一切说明，我们应该从各方面创造条件，提高产品质量，使质量下降问题尽可能不再继续发生。仅仅指出错误和缺点还是不够的。
      第二、关于学习先进经验与独立思
              考问题
    我们国家要进行社会主义建设，就必须依靠苏联的无私的援助，必须学习苏联的先进经验。在世界划分为两大阵营的时代，只有苏联和人民民主国家，才肯在技术上，物质上帮助我们，支援我们，使我们有机会学习他们的先进经验，而且很赤诚地教会我们掌握他们的先进技术。事实上，我们受到苏联先进经验的好处是很多的。是数不清的，说不完的。
    学习先进经验，应该与我国的实际情况相结合，而不是机械的教条主义的搬运。这就是说，在学习先进经验的过程中，要有独立思考的能力，要有刻苦钻研的精神。要从先进经验的基础上进一步研究，有所创造。而且要发掘我们的遗产。遗产不都是好的，但是好的也不少。只有这样，我们才能把先进经验推进一步，我们才能在社会主义阵营中作出贡献，才能不辜负苏联对我们的期待。
    当然有一些人并不能独立思考，而假借这个名词来拒绝学习先进经验，这是很不好的。
    有一些人认为苏联的先进经验不会错，根据苏联的先进经验办事，即使走了弯路，也不会受批评。这叫做“先进靠山”，有了这个“靠山”就不愿接受更新的技术，也不愿支持进一步的创造和发明。这是一种情况。
    还有一些人，对于别人独立思考的能力估计不足，对于新的事物，自己不了解，但也不相信别人，因而只愿接受苏联先进经验，不愿支持别人独立思考的成就。这又是一种情况。
    所有这些情况，都可以成为独立思考的障碍。只要这些障碍还存在的话，发挥独立思考的主动性，是得不到足够的支持与鼓励的。
    学习苏联先进经验，并不是要拒绝吸收不同制度的国家甚至敌人的科学知识。我们应该善于培养独立思考的能力。只要是先进的科学，我们都要虚心学习，把它们吸收过来，为建设社会主义服务。
      最后，请允许我就私营工商业社会
            主义改造问题讲几句话
    我完全同意陈云副总理“关于私营工商业的社会主义改造问题”的发言，这个发言说明了政府对于工商业者的关怀和照顾。定息定得很宽，各种办法考虑得很详尽，很周到，完全符合和平改造的政策，解决了目前工商业者所存在的主要问题。
    政府对于工商业者的生活，一向是很关心的。在全行业公私合营以后，国家采取了原薪不动的办法，把私方人员的生活维持下来，因而安定了人心。以后，了解到部分私方人员和小商小贩的生活有一定的困难，政府就在待遇上和业务上给以必要的照顾。现在政府对于小商小贩的生活和业务，将给以进一步的安排；对于私方人员的工资，将实行合理的调整；对于私方人员的疾病医疗，已考虑到合理的办法。这对于工商业者来说，是一个极大的鼓舞。目前部分工商业者生活困难问题，确是需要急迫地解决，而不是一个等待从容解决的问题。一方面希望有关部门在工资待遇上从速进行调整；同时，全国工商联也在考虑生活互助的办法，提供有关部门参考。
    目前，合营企业中公私工作关系，一般是正常的。但也还存在着一些问题。改善公私工作关系，要经过一定的过程。一方面要对职工群众、公股代表和资方人员进行教育，同时还需要在合营企业中建立一定的工作制度。这在陈云副总理的发言中已经说得很明白了。今后各地民建会和工商联更要紧密地主动地配合政府，积极推动私方人员加强学习，进行自我改造。我们工商业者也应该在公方代表的领导下和职工群众的帮助下，积极搞好生产经营，在具体业务实践中，把自己改造成为一个自食其力的劳动者。
