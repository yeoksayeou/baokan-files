    A Look into American Forced Labor Camps
    American Writer Kennedy
    “Want to buy a broom?”
    As I suddenly walked out of a friend's apartment in New York, a well-dressed man carrying three brooms almost fell over backwards. He hurriedly asked this question.
    "Hell no!" I replied, and hurried downstairs. I thought, selling brooms in the middle of the night is really strange!
    When I got to the street, I found another well-dressed man hovering nearby. As soon as he saw me, he suddenly turned around, pretending to be completely absorbed in the pots and pans displayed in the window of a hardware store. Only then did I realize that these two men were FBI agents ordered to follow me. Undoubtedly, they had been lurking outside my friend's door all night, trying to eavesdrop on our conversation in the room.
    Just then, a taxi approached, and I hailed it. I said to the driver, "Take me to the Trans World Airlines ticket office."
    When I arrived at the ticket office, I said to a young woman working there, "Please give me the ticket Kennedy reserved for Geneva, Switzerland."
    She smiled cheerfully and looked at the clock, saying, "We're prepared to hold your ticket until midnight." It was eleven forty-five. She issued the ticket, handed it to me, and smiled at me again. Only then did I realize that the FBI had been there before me. Obviously, she knew that I was leaving for the United Nations Committee on Forced Labor in Geneva to testify about the situation inside the United States.
    Obtaining that ticket was a major victory. Although the United Nations Committee paid the expenses of twenty witnesses who falsely accused Eastern European countries, it refused to pay any part of my expenses. The one-way fare to Geneva was three hundred US dollars, and I only managed to scrape together that amount a few minutes before the deadline.
    Initially, the United Nations Committee only allowed me ten days to go to Geneva at my own expense, but when I made a public protest, they gave me another ten days. During this period, I appealed to people for financial assistance. Like most progressive writers in America today, I am forced to live a hand-to-mouth existence, with little money of my own, but the sources of aid were many, ranging from one to twenty-five US dollars, and the donors came from all walks of life, from workers who had been forced into forced labor to a progressive millionaire.
    One member of a Black Baptist ministers' association, seeing a minister donate ten dollars, said, "Ten dollars isn't enough to buy freedom! I'm going to ask the congregation for donations."
    Thanks to this cooperation, I was able to board a four-engine jumbo jet the next evening.

    I flew across the Atlantic at night, never catching a glimpse of the ocean. Unable to sleep due to excitement, I recalled some of the things I experienced while collecting the evidence I was taking to Geneva...
    I was born in the South and have lived there all my life. In the South, there are countless forced labor camps related to turpentine, timber, and cotton planting. After reading about the activities of the United Nations Committee, I immediately provided the committee with documentary evidence.
    Although I have been collecting evidence related to the American forced labor system for twenty years, I wanted to complete my evidence with the most recent proof. Therefore, my wife and I took our camera and tape recorder and set off in our own car. It wasn't easy to get deep into these camps, but we used a method: we told the camp managers that we were there to collect folk songs, which we actually did. But once the manager left, we started on the most important thing: asking the people forced to do forced labor about their lives.
    We expected a very bad situation, but what we heard was much worse than expected. The recorder recorded stories of hunger, beatings, rape, terror, and imprisonment hour after hour, especially stories of deadly work.
    For example, the story of George Messenger and his wife. They were tenant farmers from Pensacola, Florida, elderly white people who, though there was no evidence, were sentenced to seven years of hard labor for allegedly owing a merchant US$232.76.
    Another example is James Doe, a black turpentine worker from Dublin, Georgia, whose children were held hostage for an unsubstantiated debt of US$200. He appealed to the FBI, but the FBI refused to provide assistance, and James Doe himself was arrested for the crime of "not supporting" his kidnapped children.
    Another example is Robert White, who worked at the Stallworth timber labor camp in Bennieapple, Alabama. He said he was forced to drink large amounts of castor oil, and when he fell ill and couldn't work, he was brutally beaten. There are countless such examples. When we returned home a few weeks later, we had undeniable evidence of the American authorities' ugly behavior in distorting and misinterpreting certain laws in order to allow private planters to exploit forced labor. Affected are not only poor white and black people, but also millions of workers imported from Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the British West Indies.
    While we were busy compiling this evidence into a memorandum for the United Nations, two young black men came to our house. One of them kicked the dirt with his shoe and said, "Are you the person who writes down the stories of the labor camps?"
    I looked at them, surprised. My wife and I had decided long ago, for the safety of the reporter and ourselves, not to ask anything at home.
    "Where do you work?" I asked.
    "At the Jones turpentine camp down the road."
    I said, "I think you know better than I do that if the manager finds out you're talking about his camp, you probably won't get any good out of it."
    The other one said, "There's nothing else he can do but kill us. I heard an old man in the camp say that the only way to get out of the camp is to die. But I don't believe that, because I heard people say: the truth shall set you free..."
    "Do you think there is any way the United Nations can help you?"
    He said very frankly, "Well, I think if I just explain to them what happened to me, they'll know what to do."
    "Then come in!" I said with a smile, "If you have the guts to talk, of course I'll record it!"
                  ×　×　×
    When my plane landed in Geneva, a large team of FBI and State Department agents closely monitored me at the airport.
    I immediately set off for "The Palais," where the United Nations Committee hearings were being held. As instructed by the chairman of the committee, I read my prepared statement. In the statement, I stated very clearly how American law enforcement agencies distorted vagrancy laws, fraud laws, immigration laws, and employment agency laws in order to provide private developers with forced labor.
    When I finished reading the statement, I asked the committee to listen to the recordings of interviews I had brought with me. They refused. However, previous speakers who testified were each allowed to present two witnesses (it turned out that none of these witnesses had been to Eastern Europe after 1946). However, as I left the hearing room, due to my insistence, the committee agreed to accept some auxiliary materials that I was drafting.
    All the hearings were held in secret, ostensibly to prevent them from being used as "propaganda." In reality, all those who attacked Eastern Europe released a large amount of propaganda, which the committee quoted extensively in its official news reports. But when the committee released news about my testimony on the United States that afternoon, it did not quote a single word or phrase from my memorandum or statement. The news released by the committee was just a half-page announcement, emphasizing that the hearings were no longer being held. I distributed copies of my testimony to the news media in Geneva, but of course it was suppressed in places ruled by money.
    Since then, although the American authorities have assured the United Nations of "cooperation" in any investigation into American forced labor incidents, FBI agents have been following my footsteps all over Europe. In order to force me to return home, my passport was revoked.
    When the committee finally published its 621-page report, I was not surprised to find that the entire report, with the exception of a few pages, was entirely an attack on Eastern Europe, and all the adverse testimony I had presented against the United States had been thrown into the wastebasket. The committee's report has been submitted to the United Nations Economic and Social Council for debate. In order to inform this committee of the truth, I have sent each member a copy of the suppressed testimony on forced labor in the United States.
    Now it is necessary to let the facts answer whether the belief of that American worker forced into forced labor can be realized or betrayed.

    美国强迫劳动营透视
    美国作家　肯尼迪
    “要买一条拖帚吗？”
    当我突然从纽约一位朋友的公寓里走出来的时候，一个挟着三条拖帚、衣冠楚楚的人几乎仰面跌了一交，他匆匆地发出了这个问题。
    “见鬼，我不要！”我答道。说着我就匆匆地走下楼去。我想，半夜里售卖拖帚真是怪事！
    我走到街上就发现了另一个衣冠楚楚的人在附近徘徊。他一看见我就突然转过身去，扮出全神贯注在一家铁器店橱窗陈列的壶罐与浅锅上的样子。这时我才明白这两个人都是奉命跟踪我的联邦调查局的特务。无疑的，整晚上他们就潜伏在我朋友的房门口，企图窃听我们在房间里的谈话。
    正当这时，一辆出租汽车驶近，我向这辆汽车打了招呼。我对司机说：“把我开到环球航空公司售票处。”
    当我到达了售票处，我对办事的一位青年女郎说：“请把肯尼迪预定的赴瑞士日内瓦的票给我。”
    她很爽朗地笑了笑，又看了一下挂钟说：“我们准备把你的票保留到半夜为止。”这时是十一点四十五分了。她签发了票，把票交给我又对我笑了一笑。这时我才明白联邦调查局的人已经在我之先来过了。显然，她知道我是启程前往日内瓦联合国强迫劳动问题委员会，去对美国内部情形作证的。
    取得了那张票，这就是一个重大的胜利。尽管联合国委员会偿付了诬控东欧国家的二十名证人的费用，但是它却拒绝偿付我的费用的任何一部分。赴日内瓦的单程票价是美金三百元，我在最后期限前几分钟才凑足了这笔钱。
    最初，联合国委员会只允许我在十天以内自费赴日内瓦，不过当我提出了公开的抗议时，他们就再给我十天。在这个时期我就向人们呼吁经济援助。我与今日美国大多数进步作家一样，被迫过着仅堪糊口的生活，自己没有什么钱，但是援助的来源很多，数目自美金一元至二十五元不等，出钱的人各类都有，有自己被迫从事强迫劳动的工人，也有一名进步的富翁。
    有一位黑人浸礼会牧师协会的会员，看见一位牧师捐助了十元，他就说：“用十块钱买自由是不够的！我要去向信徒们募捐。”
    由于这些合作，我才能够于次日傍晚搭乘了四引擎的巨型客机。
        ×　×　×　×
    我在夜间飞越了大西洋，一次也没有瞥见海洋。由于兴奋不能熟睡，我回忆起收集这些携往日内瓦去的证据时我所经历的一些事情………。
    我是出生在南方、终生在南方居住的人。在南方，与松节油、木材、棉花种植有关的强迫劳动营是不计其数的。我读到联合国委员会的活动以后，立即向该委员会提供文件上的证据。
    虽然我收集与美国强迫劳动制度有关的证据已历时二十年，但是我希望用最新近的证明材料来完成我的证据。因此，我的妻子与我携带了照像机、录音机，坐了自己的汽车出发。要深入这些营地并不是一件很容易的事，不过，我们用了一个方法，我们对营地的经理说，我们是来收集民歌的，事实上我们也就这样做，可是一旦经理走开了，我们就开始了最重要的事情：向被迫从事强迫劳动的人询问他们的生活情况。
    我们预期的是极坏的情况，可是我们所听闻的比预期的还要糟得多了。录音器一小时又一小时地记录了饥饿、鞭打、强奸、恐怖、囚禁的故事，尤其是摧残人命的工作的故事。
    例如乔治·麦逊杰夫妇的故事。他们本来是佛罗里达州彭萨可拉地方的佃农，是年长的白种人，由于被控欠某商人美金二百三十二元七角六分，虽无实据，但被判苦役七年。
    再如佐治亚州都布林地方的松节油工人黑人詹姆士·兑，由于欠了一笔未经证实的美金二百元的债务，他的孩子们被押为质，他向联邦调查局申诉，联邦调查局拒绝予以援助，而詹姆士·兑本人反因为“不抚养”自己被绑架去的孩子们这个罪名而被逮捕。
    又如罗伯·怀特，他在亚拉巴马州宾涅亚波尔地方斯塔尔渥斯的木材劳动营作工。他说他被迫饮了大量的蓖麻油，当他病倒不能作工的时候，就被残酷地虐打。此类事例不胜枚举。几个星期以后我们回到家里时，我们对美国当局为使私人种植者剥削强迫劳动力，因而歪曲，曲解若干法律的丑行获得了无可否认的证据。受影响的不但有穷苦的白种人、黑种人，还有自墨西哥、波多黎各以及英属西印度输入的数百万名工人。
    我们正在忙着为联合国把这些证据编成一种备忘录的时候，有两个年青的黑人到了我们家里。他们中间的一个人，用鞋子踢着泥土说：“你就是那位记述劳动营故事的人吗？”
    我注视着他们，感到诧异。我的妻子同我早已决定，为了报告者以及我们自己的安全，不在家里问什么。
    “你们在什么地方作工？”我问道。
    “就在这条路的琼斯松节油营地。”
    我说：“我想你们比我更明白，如果经理发现你们谈论他的营地，恐怕你们得不到什么好处。”
    另一个说道：“除了把我们杀害以外，他没有什么其他的办法。我听见营地里一位老年人说，只有死亡才是脱离营地唯一的方法。不过我不相信这句话，因为我听见人说：真理必使人获得自由……”
    “你想联合国有什么方法可以帮助你们吗？”
    他很率直地说：“唔，我想只要向他们解释我的遭遇，他们就会知道怎样去做的。”
    “那么进来吧！”我笑着说：“如果你们有胆量敢讲，我当然要把它录下来！”
                  ×　×　×
    当我的飞机在日内瓦着陆的时候，机场上一大队联邦调查局与国务院的特务就近对我予以监视。
    我立即动身前往“大厦”，在那里正举行着联合国委员会的听讯。按照委员会主席的吩咐，我宣读了我准备好的声明。在声明里，我极其明确地指出美国的执法机关为了向私人的开发者提供强迫的劳工，如何歪曲了浮浪法、欺诈法、移民法以及佣工介绍业。
    当我读完了声明，我请求委员会听取我带来的访问录音。他们拒绝了。然而以往作证的发言人，每个人都可以提出两个证人（结果证明在这些证人里，没有一个人是在1946年以后到东欧去过的）。不过，我在离开听讯室的时候，由于我的坚决要求，委员会应允接受我正在草拟的若干辅助材料。
    所有的听讯都是秘密进行的。在表面上是为了防止这些听讯被利用作为“宣传”。实际上，所有攻击东欧的人都发布了大量的宣传，而委员会在它的官方新闻报道里竟大量地加以摘引。但是当日下午委员会发布有关我对美国作证的新闻时，没有从我的备忘录或声明中摘录片语只字。委员会发布的新闻只是半页长的一个通告，强调说明听讯不再进行。我把我的证述抄本分发给在日内瓦的新闻人员，但是在金元统治的地方，当然遭了扣压。
    自此以后，虽然美国当局向联合国保证，在任何控诉美国强迫劳动事件的调查上进行“合作”，可是联邦调查局的特务却在欧洲到处追踪我的足迹。为了要强迫我回国，取消了我的护照。
    当委员会最后出版了它的621页长的报告书时，我发现整个报告书，除了少数几页外，全部都是对东欧的攻击，我所提出的对美国不利的一切证述都被抛进了字纸篓，这件事我并没有感到奇怪。委员会的这份报告已经提交联合国经济与社会委员会以供辩论。为了使这个委员会得悉真相，我已经把受扣压的关于美国的强迫劳动的证述抄件送给了每一个委员。
    现在需要让事实来回答那位被迫从事强迫劳动的美国工人，他的信念究竟能不能实现，还是被辜负。
