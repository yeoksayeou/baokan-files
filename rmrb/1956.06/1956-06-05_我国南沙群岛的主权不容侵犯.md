China's Sovereignty Over the Nansha Islands is Inviolable
　　Shao Xunzheng
　　China has a large number of islands, islets, shoals, and reefs in the South China Sea, reaching more than one hundred and fifty, distributed over a wide area. These islands are divided into four island groups according to their location: Dongsha, Xisha, Zhongsha, and Nansha.
　　For a long time, China has had indisputable sovereignty over these island groups. The records in Chinese historical books and the previous relevant diplomatic negotiations fully prove this fact.
　　First, regarding the Dongsha Islands. In the attached map of the "Hai Guo Wen Jian Lu" written by Chen Lunjiong around 1730, it has been included as one of the coastal islands of China. It was also repeatedly mentioned in the "Hai Lu" recorded by Yang Bingnan in 1820, based on the oral account of Xie Qinggao. According to the "Illustrated Explanation of Important Passages of China's Rivers and Seas" translated by Chen Shoupeng before 1900, we know that the "China Sea Guide," officially compiled by the British and published in 1894, clearly listed the Dongsha Islands as one of the coastal islands of China. For a long time, people from the coastal areas of Guangdong often came here. In 1907, a Japanese merchant named Nishizawa Yoshiji falsely claimed that he had discovered these islands, and built houses on the islands, mined guano, and engaged in marine products, vainly attempting to seize them for himself. However, after this illegal act was discovered by China, Li Zhun, the Guangdong Naval Commander, sent personnel to monitor Nishizawa on the island, while local officials in Guangdong protested to the Japanese consul. Japan, knowing that it was in the wrong, returned the Dongsha Islands.
　　Secondly, like the Xisha Islands. Everyone knows that it is the Qizhou Yang that is constantly recorded in Chinese old history. In the early fifteenth century, Fei Xin, a Ming Dynasty traveler who followed Zheng He on his voyages to the West, said in his book "Xing Cha Sheng Lan": "As the saying goes: Fear Qizhou above, fear Kunlun below, the needle is lost, the rudder is lost, and no one and no ship survive." Gu Zuyu, a geographer of the seventeenth century, said in his book "Du Shi Fang Yu Ji Yao": "Qilishhan has seven peaks connected, also known as Qizhou Yangshan, the forest is lush, and there are freshwater springs below, and navigators must take water from here." It can be seen that these islands have long been frequented by Chinese navigators. Chen Lunjiong's "Hai Guo Wen Jian Lu" says: "Qizhou Yang... is a must-pass place for those going to Nanyang, and there are Changsha, Shintang and other reefs in the northeast, and ships should be careful when sailing." The so-called "Changsha" and "Shintang" (or "Wanli Changsha" and "Qianli Shintang") all refer to the Xisha Islands, and are also clearly listed as Chinese coastal islands in the map he drew. Undoubtedly, these are places where Chinese people have frequently traveled and lived for a long time. Therefore, in 1907, after inspecting the Dongsha Islands, Li Zhun, the Guangdong Naval Commander, led the navy to inspect the Xisha Islands, renamed these islands, and erected flags and inscriptions to prevent others from coveting them. The Chinese fishermen he met on the island said that they "come here every year to collect hawksbill, sea cucumber, kelp and other things." In the years after 1921, the Japanese secretly came to mine guano, and built docks, railways and factories. However, under the firm opposition of the Chinese people, especially after the Canton-Hong Kong General Strike in 1926, the Japanese were in the wrong and were forced to withdraw. The coastal Chinese fishermen reorganized their fishing grounds here and greatly expanded them.
　　The Zhongsha Islands are still a group of submerged sandbanks. Its sovereignty belongs to China, and there has never been any question.
　　The Nansha Islands, which some people in the Philippines are currently coveting, are, like the Dongsha, Xisha, and Zhongsha Islands, undoubtedly Chinese territory. The largest reef in the archipelago has always been known in Chinese historical records as the "Tuansha Reefs". The largest Taiping Island in the archipelago is located on top of a reef in this group of reefs. Chinese fishermen have always regularly gone to the Nansha Islands to fish and collect marine products, and some people have stayed on the islands to live. The sovereignty of the Nansha Islands belonging to China has also long been recognized by various countries. In 1883, Germany sent people to measure the archipelago, but it was abandoned after China protested. In 1917, Japan sent people to the island to investigate and conduct operations, but eventually withdrew due to lack of justification. In 1933, France forcibly occupied nine islands in the archipelago, including the aforementioned Taiping Island and Nanwei Island, and falsely claimed that these islands "are only reefs and shoals, with few people, and are often submerged by sea water." But this fallacy is self-defeating. As the British-published "China Sea Guide" says: "Hainan Island fishermen live by catching sea cucumbers and shells. Taiping Island and other islands have traces of them, and some have lived on Taiping Island for a long time. Ships from Hainan sail to Taiping Island every year to carry rice and other necessities to exchange for sea cucumbers and shells with the fishermen." The same book also mentions that Shuangzi Reef in the archipelago is also "often visited by Hainan fishermen to catch sea cucumbers and shells." Therefore, on August 21 of the same year, France admitted: "Chinese fishermen have lived on two of the islands," but still attempted to use the setting up of lighthouses to facilitate navigation as a pretext for invasion. At that time, the Chinese government lodged a serious protest to France, stating that these islands had long been frequented by Chinese fishermen, and that Chinese people lived there, and there were temples and cemeteries, and the sovereignty undoubtedly belonged to China, but France delayed and did not reply. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Nansha Islands and other Chinese islands in the South China Sea were occupied by Japan. It was not until after Japan's surrender in 1945 that all these islands were returned to China. In 1946, China sent warships to formally take over, rebuilt stone tablets on Yongxing Island in the Xisha Islands and Taiping Island in the Nansha Islands, and surveyed and mapped detailed maps, and established meteorological stations and radio stations on the islands. All the islands in the South China Sea have been returned to China, which is a fact that the world has witnessed.
　　Regardless of these ironclad historical facts, certain foreign forces have repeatedly expressed their ambitions for these Chinese territories. During the Chinese People's Liberation War, in July 1946, the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs made an unreasonable statement, expressing interest in the Nansha Islands. After the liberation of mainland China, in May 1950, the Philippine authorities made another provocative statement. In 1951, American imperialism, in the second paragraph of the second chapter of the so-called "Peace Treaty with Japan," which it concocted, stipulated that Japan should abandon all rights to the Xisha Islands and Nanwei Island, while deliberately failing to mention the fact that these islands had actually been returned to China, in an attempt to obliterate it. Therefore, on August 15 of the same year, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, issued a statement solemnly pointing out:
　　"The Xisha Islands and Nanwei Island, like the entire Nansha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Dongsha Islands, have always been Chinese territory. Although they were once occupied during the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression, they were all taken over by the Chinese government at that time after Japan surrendered. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby declares: The inviolable sovereignty of the People's Republic of China over Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands shall not be affected by whether or how the draft of the US-British Peace Treaty with Japan stipulates."
　　This statement could not be clearer.
　　However, according to recent reports from certain foreign news agencies, some people in the Philippines are still expressing unreasonable interest in the Nansha Islands. It seems that these people are not clear enough about the indisputable legal sovereignty of the People's Republic of China over all these islands. This cannot but be a strange thing. However, after the solemn statement made once again by the spokesman of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 29, they should understand that any form of encroachment will constitute an act of undermining China's territorial sovereignty; they should also understand that any excuse is in vain.

    我国南沙群岛的主权不容侵犯
    邵循正
    我国在南中国海上的岛、屿、滩、礁数目很多，达到一百五十个以上，分布的地区也很广。这些岛屿按照位置划分为东沙、西沙、中沙和南沙四个岛群。
    我国对这些岛群，长期以来，具有无可争辩的主权。我国史籍的记载和历次有关的对外交涉都充分地证明了这一事实。
    首先，关于东沙群岛。在1730年左右陈伦烱著的“海国闻见录”的附图中，它已被列入中国沿海的岛屿。在1820年杨炳南所记的由谢清高口述的“海录”中，也再三提到它。根据1900年前陈寿彭译的“中国江海险要图说”，我们知道当时英国官方编的、在1894年出版的“中国海指南”也明白地把东沙群岛列为中国沿海岛屿之一。长期以来，广东沿海人民时常到这里来。到了1907年，日本商人西泽吉次竟捏称这些岛屿是他发现的，并在岛上建筑房舍，开采鸟粪，经营海产，妄想据为己有。但这种不法行为被中国发觉后，一面由广东水师提督李准派员在岛上监视西泽，一面由广东地方官吏向日本领事抗议，日本自知理屈而交还东沙群岛。
    其次，如西沙群岛。大家都知道它是中国旧史上不断著录的七洲洋。在十五世纪初叶，跟随郑和下西洋的明代旅行家费信在所著的“星槎胜览”一书中就说：“俗云：上怕七洲，下怕昆仑，针迷舵失，人船莫存”。十七世纪的地理学者顾祖禹在所著“读史方舆纪要”中说：“七里山有七峰相连，一名七洲洋山，林山茂盛，下出淡泉，航海者必取汲于此。”可见这些岛上很早就常有中国航海人民的踪迹。陈伦烱的“海国闻见录”说：“七洲洋……凡往南洋者必经之所，其东北有长沙、石塘等礁，舟行宜慎”。所谓“长沙”“石塘”（或作“万里长沙”“千里石塘”）都是指西沙群岛，也都是在他所绘的图中明白列入中国沿海岛屿的。无疑的，这都是中国人民长期以来经常来往居住的地方。因此在1907年广东水师提督李准在视察东沙群岛之后，就统率海军视察西沙群岛，将这些岛屿重新命名，并竖旗勒石，以杜绝别人的觊觎。他遇到的岛上中国渔民都说，他们“每年都来此取玳瑁、海参、海带等物。”在1921年后的几年中，日本人偷来开采鸟粪，并且修筑了码头、铁路和工厂。但在中国人民坚决反对之下，特别在1926年省港大罢工之后，日本人理屈，被迫撤退，沿海中国渔人就在这里重整渔场，大加扩充。
    中沙群岛直到现在还是隐没在水下的一群暗沙，它的主权属于中国，没有发生过疑问。
    目前菲律宾一些人所垂涎的南沙群岛，和东沙、西沙、中沙等群岛一样，没有疑问地是中国的领土。群岛中最大的群礁，在中国史籍上是一向以“团沙群礁”著名的。群岛中最大的太平岛，就是在这群礁中一个暗礁的上面。南沙群岛一向有中国渔民定期前往捕鱼、采集海产，并有一些人留在岛上居住。南沙群岛的主权属于中国也早经各国所承认。1883年德国派人到群岛测量，经中国抗议而作罢。1917年日本派人到岛上调查，进行经营，终以欠缺理由而撤退。1933年法国强占了群岛中的九个岛，包括上述的太平岛和南威岛，并捏称这些岛“仅属暗礁沙滩，几无人烟，时被海水淹没”。但这个谬说是不攻自破的。如英国出版的“中国海指南”就说：“海南岛渔民以捕取海参、介壳为活，太平岛等岛都有他们踪迹，也有长居在太平岛上的。海南每岁有船驶往太平岛携米粮及其他必需品与渔民交换海参、贝壳”。同书又提到群岛中的双子礁也“常有海南渔人前来捕取海参及贝壳等”。因此，同年八月二十一日法国承认：“其中两岛已住有中国渔民”，但仍企图以设置灯塔便利航海作为侵占的借口。当时中国政府向法国提出严重抗议，声明这些岛屿长期以来有中国渔民来往，也有中国人民居住，且有神庙、墓地，主权无疑问地应属中国，但法国迁延不复。抗日战争时期，南沙群岛和南中国海中的中国其他岛屿，都被日本侵占。直到1945年日本投降后，所有这些岛屿才全部归还中国。1946年中国派军舰前往正式接收，在西沙群岛的永兴岛和南沙群岛的太平岛重建石碑，并测绘详图，在岛上设立气象所和无线电台。南中国海各岛已经全部归还中国，这是世界各国有目共睹的事实。
    不顾这些铁的历史事实，某些外国势力仍然一再表示对这些中国领土的野心。在中国人民解放战争期间，1946年7月菲律宾外交部曾作无理的声明，表示对南沙群岛发生兴趣。在中国大陆解放之后，1950年5月，菲律宾当局又做了一次挑衅式的声明。1951年美帝国主义在其一手包办的所谓“对日和约”的第二章第二款中，规定了日本应放弃西沙群岛和南威岛的一切权利，同时故意不提这些岛屿实际上已经归还中国的事实，企图加以抹煞。因此同年八月十五日，我国外交部长周恩来发表声明严正地指出：
    “西沙群岛和南威岛正如整个南沙群岛及中沙群岛、东沙群岛一样，向为中国领土，在日本帝国主义发动侵略战争时虽曾一度沦陷，但日本投降后已为当时中国政府全部接收。中华人民共和国中央人民政府于此声明：中华人民共和国在南威岛和西沙群岛之不可侵犯的主权，不论美英对日和约草案有无规定及如何规定，均不受任何影响。”
    这个声明是再清楚不过的了。
    但是，根据最近某些外国通讯社的报道，菲律宾的某些人对南沙群岛，还在表示着毫无理由的兴趣。似乎这些人对于中华人民共和国对于这些全部岛屿的无可争辩的合法主权还不够明白。这不能不是一件怪事。但五月二十九日我国外交部发言人再一次的严正声明以后，他们应该了解，任何形式的侵占都要构成破坏中国领土主权的行为；他们也应该了解，任何借口都是徒然的。
