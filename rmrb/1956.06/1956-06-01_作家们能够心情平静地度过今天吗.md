Can Writers Spend Today in Peace of Mind?
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Last November, the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association issued instructions on the development of children's literature, requiring "member writers engaged in creation and translation to write (or translate) a children's literary work by the end of June 1956; theoretical critics should write at least one research article on children's literature by the end of 1956." It also required member writers participating in the Children's Literature Group of the Creation Committee to "write at least one work by the end of 1955, and at least three works in 1956." Half a year has passed since last November. Recently, the Writers Association sent survey letters to more than two hundred writers. Among the more than ninety letters received, only thirty-six people have written works. The development of children's literature this year is indeed exciting. However, in any case, it is still necessary to raise this issue today.

Some writers said in their replies to the Writers Association: "Strive to write something by the end of the year." If the children hear such an answer, they would probably smile wryly, or shout and ask: "There are still seven or eight months until the end of the year, are you only going to write something, and still have to strive for it?"

Strive for what? It seems that someone is preventing writers from writing for children? Of course not. Perhaps the first thing to strive for is time. Many writers are in administrative positions, and still lack the necessary time to ensure life practice, creation, and research. But what about some professional writers, where is the problem for them?

An old writer once said a very meaningful sentence: "Whether you can write it or not depends on whether you have a childlike heart!" This sentence is very pertinent. Loving children and truly cultivating them as future masters and communist fighters is the responsibility of the entire society, and naturally also the responsibility of writers. A human soul engineer has an inescapable duty in the cultivation and education of the new generation.

Perhaps some people think they can forgive themselves because they have already written and published a piece, as if they can turn around and do other things from then on. It seems that writing children's literature is just a matter of "reluctantly obliging" or "doing it occasionally." In fact, children's need for spiritual food is very urgent, and cannot be satisfied by "doing it occasionally"; just talking about "obliging," writers who have been in contact with children all know that children always treat writers with the most sincere and enthusiastic feelings. Isn't this enthusiasm, which not only makes you "reluctant," but also deeply moves you, something that can be compensated by a story or a poem?

Moreover, it is not uncommon to treat writing children's literature as a byproduct, writing a little bit along the way, and naturally reducing the quality requirements. "Give the best to children" has not yet fully formed a trend, a slogan of action in our society. If writers can treat the works they write for children as solemnly as they treat their other novels, plays, and poems, and if theoretical critics can pay more attention to the current situation of children's literature creation, the quality of our children's literature may be higher than it is now, and some formulaic and dull works may be less than they are now.

Like doing all work, we must not allow ourselves to be lazy or fake in this.

Writing this, some well-meaning comrades will sigh: Why do we always have to call for it every "June 1" Children's Day? What can be done? As long as you go to Xinhua Bookstore today to see the situation where children's books are in such short supply, you will agree that this call still has its practical significance. Perhaps it will not be superfluous to call for it until the year when our writers, poets, and playwrights can spend "June 1" Children's Day without any guilt and in peace of mind. May this day come soon.

    作家们能够心情平静地度过今天吗
    本报评论员
    去年十一月，中国作家协会主席团发出了关于发展少年儿童文学的指示，要求“从事创作、翻译工作的会员作家，在1956年6月底前，写出（或翻译）一篇（部）少年儿童文学作品；理论批评家应在1956年年底前，至少写一篇有关少年儿童文学的有研究性的文章”。要求参加创作委员会少年儿童文学组的会员作家，在1955年年底前，“至少写出一篇作品，在1956年内应至少写出三篇作品”。从去年十一月到现在，已经半年过去了，最近，作家协会向二百多位作家发了调查信，在收回来的九十多封信中，已经写出作品的，只有三十六人。这个统计不是精确的，因为没有回信的作家中，也有写了的。少年儿童文学这一年来发展的情况，确实令人兴奋。但是，无论如何，这个问题今天还是有必要提起。
    有的作家在给作家协会的回信上说：“争取年底能写篇把东西。”如果孩子们听到这样的回答，大约是会苦笑的，或者，就会嚷着问：“现在到年底还有七八个月时间，难道您就只写篇把东西，还要争取？”
    向谁争取？好像是有人在阻碍着作家为孩子们写作么？当然不是。恐怕首先要争取的是时间。许多作家都在行政工作岗位上，至今仍然缺少保证生活实践和创作、研究的必要时间。但是，也还有一些专业作家，在他们，问题又在哪里呢？
    有一位老作家说过这么一句意味深长的话：“写得出写不出，就看你有没有童心！”这句话是十分中肯的。热爱儿童，真正地按照培养未来的主人翁、共产主义战士那样来培养他们，是全社会的责任，自然也是作家们的责任。一个人类灵魂工程师对新的一代的培养和教育上，有不容推辞的职责。
    也许有人认为可以原谅自己。因为他已经写了一篇并且发表了，仿佛这就可以从此掉转头干别的事去了。好像写儿童文学作品，只是“情面难却”“偶一为之”的事。其实，孩子们对精神粮食的需要，是非常迫切，不是“偶一为之”就能满足他们的；就说“情面”吧，同孩子们接触过的作家们都了解，孩子们永远是以最真挚、最热烈的感情来对待作家的，这种不仅使你“难却”、而且使你深深感动的热情，难道是一篇故事或者一首诗就能抵偿得过的么？
    何况，也并不是没有这样的情况：把写少年儿童文学作品当作副产品，捎带着写点儿，自然而然地对质量的要求就降低了。“把最好的给儿童”，在我们的社会里现在还没有完全形成一种风气，一种行动的口号。作家们如果能像他写其他的小说、剧本、诗歌那样地郑重对待给孩子们写的作品，理论批评家如果能多注意一下少年儿童文学创作的现状，我们的少年儿童文学的质量也许要比现在更高些，一些公式主义的、枯燥无味的作品，也许要比现在更少些。
    跟做一切工作一样；在这上面也决不容许我们有一点偷懒和做假。
    写到这里，有的好心的同志会感慨：为什么年年“六一”儿童节总要呼吁一下。这有什么办法呢？你只要今天到新华书店去瞧瞧少年儿童读物那样地供不应求的情况，你就会同意这呼吁还有它的现实意义了。也许要等到哪一年，我们的作家、诗人、剧作家们可以毫无愧色地、心情平静地度过“六一”儿童节的时候，呼吁才是多余的。但愿这一天早早来到。
