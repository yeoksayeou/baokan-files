Developing Museum Undertakings to Serve Scientific Research and the Broad Masses of People

Museum undertakings are an important component of socialist cultural undertakings. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, they have greatly developed and accomplished a great deal of work. According to incomplete statistics, in 1955 alone, the number of museum visitors across the country reached 7.88 million. The broad masses of people received patriotic and socialist ideological education here, enhancing their love for the motherland and inspiring their enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction. Over the past six years, museums across the country have also collected 1.29 million items of revolutionary relics, historical artifacts, artistic creations of past dynasties, natural specimens, and materials on socialist construction and socialist transformation. This large-scale collection work was completely unimaginable in the old society.

It should be pointed out that under the new situation of the rapid development of socialist construction and the growing cultural demands of the people, museum undertakings, both in terms of quantity and quality, are far behind actual needs. In particular, in order to cooperate with the march towards science, it is even more necessary to carry out museum work. Because museums are one of the necessary conditions for conducting scientific research work. Museums preserve rich material and spiritual cultural objects and natural specimens, which are all original materials for studying various departments of science. If these materials can be fully and effectively utilized for scientific research work, it will undoubtedly promote the cause of advancing towards science in all aspects. Recently, the Ministry of Culture convened a national museum work conference, which determined the future direction of museum development and emphasized that museums must effectively serve scientific research. This is correct and necessary.

To enable museum undertakings to better serve scientific research and the broad masses of people, the first step is to conscientiously carry out the scientific research work of the museums themselves. This is the main key to improving the quality of museum work and the basis for museums to serve scientific research. At present, the collection work of museums in our country is not broad enough in scope and lacks sufficient methods. It lacks careful planning in advance and scientific records in the process. After cultural relics enter the museum, they lack timely scientific sorting. In terms of exhibition work, most are still in the stage of listing cultural relics and phenomena, lacking scientific analysis and explanation based on the viewpoint of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. It should be understood that various cultural relics cannot become rich and useful materials without extensive and timely collection; even if they are collected, they will lose their scientific research value if they are not scientifically recorded and sorted; and the various exhibition works of museums cannot have a high degree of ideological and scientific value without careful scientific research. Therefore, only by placing all museum activities on the basis of scientific research can we do a good job in all aspects of the museum itself; and only then can we provide valuable materials for scientific research institutions and scientific researchers; and only then can we better serve the improvement of the ideological level and scientific and cultural level of the broad masses of people with in-depth and simple exhibitions. Therefore, museum workers must start from their existing level, be honest, study diligently, learn Marxism-Leninism, and be proficient in their professional work to ensure that every link in the museum undertaking has a high degree of ideological and scientific value.

Objects, specimens, and other materials are the material basis of all museum activities and the first-hand materials for conducting scientific research work. Therefore, it is necessary to promptly do a good job in the collection of revolutionary relics, scattered historical relics, especially ethnic minority relics, as well as materials on socialist construction and socialist transformation; museums with the conditions should also cooperate with the country's basic construction projects, and under the leadership and help of the local Party committees and governments, carry out archaeological excavations. Due to the rapid development of socialist construction in our country at present, the face of the motherland is changing rapidly. Many materials related to the people's production struggle and class struggle are easily lost or destroyed if they are not collected in a timely manner. Museums should take responsibility for collecting these historical, national, and current social development and other important materials in a timely manner, and organize and study them. In this regard, local Party and government organs and mass organizations should give strong support, and continue to educate the broad masses of people to protect cultural relics, so as to avoid undue losses to the country's cultural relic materials.

In order to cooperate with the development of scientific research in various departments and to conduct education on various scientific knowledge to the broad masses of people, the Academy of Sciences and various departments of the national economy should pay more attention to organizing various resource and construction exhibitions, and should gradually establish various specialized museums in a planned way. The existing and to-be-established museums in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should better combine with the actual needs of construction in various places, give play to the characteristics of various places in terms of nature, history, and construction, and at the same time, do not neglect the national exhibition content necessary for educating the people. In the process of organizing and promoting the development of museum undertakings across the country, cultural departments must fully rely on and give play to the strength of various localities and professional departments, and at the same time, must pay attention to maximizing the needs of the construction work of various localities and professional departments, otherwise the museum undertaking cannot be carried out correctly and smoothly.

Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out at the meeting on the issue of intellectuals convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 14 this year: In order to realize the plan of marching towards science, we must prepare all necessary conditions for the development of scientific research, and we must strengthen the work of libraries, archives, and museums. Party and government organs at all levels, especially cultural administrative departments, should pay attention to strengthening the leadership of museums, giving due attention and support to their work, gradually improving some necessary conditions for museums, and summarizing and promoting advanced experience in a timely manner, so that the museum undertaking in our country can steadily develop and improve, and better serve the country's socialist construction.

### 发展博物馆事业，为科学研究和广大人民服务

    发展博物馆事业，为科学研究和广大人民服务
    博物馆事业是社会主义文化事业的重要组成部分。建国以来，它已经有了很大的发展，做了不少的工作。据不完全的统计，仅在1955年全国博物馆的观众即达788万人次，广大人民从这里受到爱国主义和社会主义的思想教育，增强了对祖国的热爱，鼓舞了人们参加社会主义建设的劳动热情。六年多来，全国博物馆还征集了革命文物、历史文物、历代艺术创作、自然标本和社会主义建设与社会主义改造的资料达129万号。这种规模巨大的征集工作在旧社会是完全不能设想的。
    应该指出，在目前社会主义建设飞跃发展、人民群众文化要求日益增长的新形势下，博物馆事业无论在数量上，质量上，还远远落在实际需要的后面。特别是为了配合向科学进军，更加需要开展博物馆工作。因为博物馆是进行科学研究工作的必要条件之一，在博物馆里保藏着丰富的物质文化和精神文化的实物和自然标本，它们都是研究各有关部门科学的原始资料，如果能够充分和有效地利用这些资料来进行科学研究工作，那么无疑地就将在各个方面推进向科学进军的事业。最近文化部召开了全国博物馆工作会议，确定了今后博物馆发展的方向，着重地指出博物馆必须有效地为科学研究服务，这是正确的和必要的。
    要使博物馆事业更好地为科学研究服务，为广大人民群众服务，首先应该认真地进行博物馆本身的科学研究工作，这是提高博物馆工作质量的主要关键，也是博物馆为科学研究服务的基础。目前我国博物馆的征集工作，方面还不广，办法还不多，事先缺乏周密的计划，在进行过程中缺乏科学的纪录，文物入馆以后又缺乏及时的科学的整理；在陈列工作方面，大多还处于罗列文物，罗列现象的阶段，缺乏以辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的观点为基础的科学的分析和解释。要知道各种文物如果不经过广泛和及时的征集，就不可能成为丰富有用的资料；征集了，如果不经过科学的记述和整理，也就会失去科学研究的价值；博物馆的各项陈列工作，如果不经过精心的科学研究，就不可能具有高度的思想性和科学性。因此，只有把博物馆全部活动放在科学研究的基础上，才可能作好博物馆本身的各项工作；也才有可能为科学研究机关和科学研究人员提供有价值的资料；才能更好地以深入浅出的陈列为提高广大人民的思想水平和科学文化水平而服务。因此，博物馆工作人员必须从现有的水平出发，老老实实，刻苦钻研，学习马克思列宁主义，精通本行业务，保证博物馆事业中各个环节都能具有高度的思想性和科学性。
    实物、标本以及其他各项资料，是博物馆全部活动的物质基础，也是进行科学研究工作的第一手材料。因此，必须及时地作好对革命文物、流散的历史文物，特别是少数民族文物以及社会主义建设和社会主义改造的资料的征集工作；有条件的博物馆，还应该配合国家的基本建设工程，在当地党委、政府的领导和帮助之下，进行考古发掘工作。由于目前我国社会主义建设的迅速发展，祖国的面貌改变得很快，许多关系人民生产斗争和阶级斗争的资料，如不及时加以征集，就很容易散失或者消灭。博物馆应该负起责任来及时地征集这些历史的、民族的和当前社会发展的以及其他重要资料，加以整理和研究。在这一方面，各地党政机关和群众团体应当给以大力的支持，并且要向广大群众继续进行保护文物的教育，以免国家的文物资料遭到不应有的损失。
    为了配合各部门科学研究工作的发展，为了向广大人民进行各类科学知识的教育，科学院和国民经济的各部门应该更加注意组织各种资源和建设的展览会，并且有计划地逐步地成立各种专业博物馆。各省、自治区、市已有的和将要成立的博物馆应该更好地结合各个地方建设的实际需要，发挥各个地方在自然、历史和建设各方面的特点，同时又不要忽略对人民进行教育所必需的全国性的陈列内容。文化部门在组织和推动全国博物馆事业向前发展的过程中，必须充分地依靠和发挥各地方和各专业部门的力量，同时必须注意最大限度地适应各个地方和各专业部门建设工作的需要，否则博物馆事业就不可能得到正确的和顺利的开展。
    周恩来同志在今年一月十四日中国共产党中央委员会召开的关于知识分子问题的会议上，曾经指出：为了实现向科学进军的计划，我们必须为发展科学研究准备一切必要的条件，必须加强图书馆，档案馆，博物馆工作。各级党政机关，特别是文化行政部门应该注意加强对博物馆的领导，对它的工作予以应有的重视和支持，逐步地改善博物馆一些必要的条件，及时总结和推广先进经验，使我国博物馆事业稳步地发展和提高，更好地为国家的社会主义建设服务。
