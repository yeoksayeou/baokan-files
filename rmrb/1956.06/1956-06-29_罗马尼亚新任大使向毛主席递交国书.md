Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The newly appointed Romanian Ambassador to China, Nicolae Cioroiu, accompanied by diplomatic officials including the Counselor of the Embassy, Mentanu, presented his credentials to Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, on the afternoon of the 28th. Present were Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Liu Jingyu, Deputy Director of the Department of Soviet and Eastern European Affairs, and Wang Yutian, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

When presenting his credentials, Ambassador Nicolae Cioroiu delivered a eulogy, saying:

    The Romanian Government notes with satisfaction that the relations of cooperation and friendship between our two peoples have been developing, that economic and cultural ties are growing, and that it is confident that these relations will continue to develop in the future for the benefit of both peoples. Our deep conviction in this is based on our understanding that the relations between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China are governed by the principles of the immortal Lenin doctrine.

    Without a doubt, the development of comprehensive relations between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China contributes to the cause of building socialism in our two countries and to safeguarding peace and international security.

Chairman Mao Zedong replied:

    The Romanian People's Republic is the first state in Romanian history in which the people's masses have held power. The establishment of the Romanian People's Republic has enabled the Romanian people to embark on the road of socialist construction. Since liberation, the Romanian people have achieved great successes in the cause of socialist construction and in the struggle to defend European and world peace. I believe that the Romanian people will achieve even greater victories in the future.

    In recent years, the cooperation between our two countries in the political, economic, cultural and other fields has made the friendship between our two peoples increasingly consolidated and developed. This multi-faceted cooperation and fraternal friendship not only conform to the interests of our two peoples, but also to the interests of maintaining world peace.

    罗马尼亚政府满意地确认，我们两国人民间的合作和友谊的关系一直是在发展着的，经济和文化联系在成长着，并且满怀信心地相信，为了两国人民的利益，这些关系今后仍将继续发展。我们之所以深信这一点，乃是因为我们理解到罗马尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间的关系是遵循着不朽的列宁学说的原则的。
