    We are Confident in Completing the National Plan Ahead of Schedule and Exceeding Targets
    -- Speech by Representative Zhu Shunyu
    This year's national budget requires a 31.27% increase in state-owned industrial income compared to last year, which is achievable.
    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen. In this year's national budget, a 31.27% increase in state-owned industrial income compared to last year is required, which I believe is entirely correct and achievable. This is because, since the beginning of this year, a nationwide upsurge of workers and staff striving to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceed targets has been launched. This vigorous mass movement is the most reliable guarantee for increasing state-owned industrial income. Take our Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory as an example. Everyone knows that steam turbines and large diesel engines are relatively complex products, and we only successfully trial-produced the first 6,000 kW steam turbine last year. According to the original planned control figures for the year, our factory's total output value this year should increase by 151.02% compared to last year, profits turned over to the state should increase by 41.97% compared to last year, and labor productivity should increase by 68.08% compared to last year. However, after discussion by the masses, these control figures were all surpassed. After verification by higher authorities, the current national plan has been increased by 6.64% in terms of total output value and 2.74% in terms of profits turned over to the state compared to the original control figures. I think these figures are enough to illustrate how much our factory's industrial production has improved this year compared to last year! To ensure the realization of this plan, at the Workers' Representative Conference held in January this year, we specifically studied the issue of promoting advanced experiences, strengthening technical and cultural education, and improving labor protection. After this meeting, the socialist emulation drive in the factory developed more vigorously. Female milling machine operator Shen Shujuan also said: "I have to operate two machine tools, and I will complete half a year's task two months ahead of schedule." In the past, only workers participated in the emulation drive, but now technicians and staff in offices are also actively participating in the emulation upsurge. Offices and offices, workshops and workshops have signed contact contracts. Experienced workers ensure they teach their apprentices well, and offices help workshops solve planning and technical problems. Technician Zhao Yisheng said: "In the past, when we went to the workshop, we wandered around and couldn't get involved. Now you help me, and I help you, and everyone is working together with great enthusiasm." In the competition, everyone learns from each other and helps each other, and many advanced examples have emerged: for example, Chen Weijun, the leader of the Ye Gen team, after the quota setter helped him calculate the details, automatically reduced the quota and accelerated the feed rate, increasing it from 14 cars (18 pieces per car) to 19 cars per day, ensuring that the daily output increased from 252 pieces to 342 pieces; another example is labor model Zhuang Yonglin. The original quota for assembling nozzles was 3.5 hours per piece, and after the quota was revised in January this year, it was 2 hours per piece. The workshop foreman believed that the quota was raised too high and asked to add 10 to 20 minutes to him, but after the annual plan was discussed, Zhuang Yonglin and Chen Taihong not only did not ask to lower the new quota, but also took the initiative to propose that the new quota could be reduced by another 10 minutes per piece; Cao Fushou, a turner in the large parts section, once proposed 21 rationalization proposals; after discussion by all the workers in the steel casting workshop, they proposed 22 measures to ensure the completion of the annual task in 7 months. Song Wanqing of the steam turbine workshop, with the help of Shengli from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, achieved a high-speed cutting speed of over 1,300 meters. There are many such examples. Because of this, the actual situation of our factory in implementing the national plan in the first quarter of this year is good: the total output value completed 123% of the plan, the total value of goods completed 107%, the labor productivity completed 122%, and the total profit and profits turned over to the state completed 100%. Moreover, by the end of May this year, our factory had reached the main production targets for 1957. Taking steam turbines as an example, the state stipulated that the 1957 level was 84,500 kW, and by the end of May this year, we had completed 92,500 kW, exceeding the 1957 target. Now, our factory is further striving to comprehensively complete the cumulative figures of the state-stipulated Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and ensuring that it will be completed ahead of schedule by the end of November this year.
    With the continuous development of production, the number of employees in our factory has increased by 8.8 times compared to 1949; the factory building area has increased by 12.2 times compared to 1949, and workers' dormitories will also be expanded this year; at the same time, workers' welfare has also developed accordingly.

    Problems Existing in the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory
    In Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report, it was pointed out that in order to realize the national budget for 1956, it is particularly necessary to pay attention to correcting the tendency of some enterprises to one-sidedly pursue "more" and "faster" in industrial production without equally emphasizing "good," "economical," and "safe"; in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's speech, it was also mentioned some shortcomings and errors that occurred in the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. I think the problems they pointed out are necessary and correct, and also in line with the actual situation of our factory. Although our factory has achieved some results in the past few years, there are still many shortcomings and problems at the same time: from the leadership's perspective, the socialist enthusiasm of all employees in the factory is still underestimated. For example, 6 steam turbines were completed last year, but only 3 were planned originally; another example is that the production level of 1957 has been reached by May this year, completing the plan 19 months ahead of schedule, which is a clear example. Secondly, the socialist labor enthusiasm of all employees in the factory has been greatly improved, but the leadership and management level of the enterprise cannot keep up, especially there are still many problems in planning. Workers often have nothing to do at the beginning of the month when it is loose, and they are pulled around, and at the end of the month when it is tight, workers have to work overtime. From the perspective of technical work, the state wants us to catch up with the level of advanced countries in 12 years, but our "repair and assembly" thinking has not been completely overcome; for the newly-recruited workers, they are asked to work before they have learned the technology well, and technical education is not valued, which has caused many rejects. Not enough attention is paid to the living welfare of employees, especially the workers' housing problem is very serious. Two-thirds of the workers in our factory cannot get family dormitories, and the workers also complained that "our canteen is like a steamer," and they can't eat when they enter the canteen. As far as I know, although many factories have a budget for building workers' dormitories this year, the plan has failed because they cannot buy building materials. I sincerely hope that the relevant departments can appropriately solve this urgent problem of the vast number of employees. The problem of safe production is even more serious. There have been particularly many industrial accidents in our factory this year. There were 29 industrial accidents in the first quarter, and workers are often injured in their hands and feet. One worker died because the scrap steel was not carefully cleaned, causing an explosion. The reason why the problem is so serious is mainly because the leadership only emphasizes production and does not emphasize safety, and focuses on production tasks while ignoring other aspects. I think all the above problems should be paid attention to and corrected in the future, which is essential for further developing the enthusiasm and creativity of our employees.
    Dear representatives! Since the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened the meeting of representatives of advanced producers, the movement of advanced producers across the country has been further deepened. Especially the study and application of advanced experience has aroused the interest and enthusiasm of the vast number of employees. Now Shanghai is holding a training class on advanced experience in the industrial exhibition, and many industrial departments have cultivated a group of backbone members to promote advanced experience. Due to the powerful development of the advanced producer movement, our vast number of employees are confident that they will be able to complete the country's first five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceed targets, which is the most powerful support of our vast number of employees for the national budget of 1956.

    Opinions on Rural Work
    1. Do not stipulate the planting of crops in agricultural cooperatives too mechanically
    2. Prevent the generalization and administrative order problems in promoting advanced crops
    3. Pay attention to the quality of urban garbage supplied to rural areas as fertilizer
    Secondly, I also fully agree with the errors and shortcomings mentioned in Vice Premier Deng Zihui's speech regarding the agricultural cooperativization movement. I am a worker myself, but my family is a farmer, so I am more familiar with the situation in rural areas. Here, I would also like to put forward three opinions on the problems in rural work:
    1. In some areas, the planting of crops in agricultural cooperatives is stipulated too mechanically. Like our factory in Minhang, which is more than 50 li away from Shanghai, the vegetables that employees eat have to be bought in Shanghai by car every day. Because the Minhang area is designated as a rice and cotton production area, the society only focuses on increasing the production of grain and cotton, and does not adaptively increase the production of vegetables with the development of the factory and the increase of workers. On the other hand, farmers have many opinions. They reflect: "If you plant one mu of radish and have a good harvest, you can sell it for more than 300 yuan, and you can sell it three months after planting; you can harvest one mu of Chinese cabbage in just one month. But if you plant one mu of rice, it takes six months, and the income is at most 70 or 80 yuan. As a result, the worker brothers cannot eat cheap vegetables, the farmers reduce their income, and the country wastes vehicle gasoline. Everyone does not benefit."
    2. There are problems of generalization and administrative orders in promoting advanced crops. Like Maqiao District, this year's promotion of double-cropping rice did not take into account whether the soil, climate, and seeds were suitable, and it was promoted by means of administrative orders. But what was the result? When I set off for Beijing this time, the rice planted in the fields for the first time still could not grow, and the farmers were very anxious: "The second crop cannot be planted this year either." They had to plow the rice that had been planted into 90 percent of the fields with cattle. Farmer Zhu Genxiang said with tears in his eyes: "Promoting double-cropping rice was originally a good thing, but now it costs us ten yuan per mu (ten catties of rice seed, one fertilizer, plus labor), and this year's late rice fertilizer is still a problem." He also said: "We know that the country has difficulties and cannot establish research institutes everywhere, but before you are sure, why don't you ask us to try planting dozens of acres first, and then promote it, so as not to cause such a situation."
    3. In the work of supplying urban garbage to rural areas as fertilizer, the quality is not valued, and the relevant leading departments have a bureaucratic style. Last year, when I went to Maqiao District for inspection, farmer Zhu Shuxiang said to me: "The city people are really unreasonable, and even bully us farmers with garbage." Later, I learned that the garbage that the farmers bought at a cost of 1.2 yuan per ton under compulsion contained 50% coal ash and 10% glass, broken bowls, broken bricks, and tin cans. After the farmers bought it back, they could not finish picking it out even if they spent a day on one ton of garbage. After it was used in the fields, it often caused injury accidents to farmers and cattle. The farmers could not bear to see the good fields ruined in vain, so they had to pile the garbage they bought at a cost on both sides of the river, as much as several hundred tons, and let it be wasted. Later, I wrote a letter to the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress and the Shanghai County Magistrate's Office, asking them to pay attention to it, but there was no reply afterwards, and I don't know if it has been resolved.

### 我们有信心提早和超额完成国家计划

    我们有信心提早和超额完成国家计划
    ——朱顺余代表的发言
    今年国家预算要求国营工业收入比去年增加31.27％是可以做得到的
    我对李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长兼秘书长的报告，完全同意。在今年的国家预算里要求国营工业收入比去年增加31.27％，我认为这是完全正确的，可以做得到的。因为从今年年初开始，在全国的职工群众中掀起了一个争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的热潮，这个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，就是提高国营工业收入最可靠的保证。拿我们上海汽轮机厂来说，大家都知道汽轮机和大型柴油机都是比较复杂的产品，而且我们刚刚在去年才试制成功第一台6，000瓩汽轮机。按照年度国家原定的控制数字，我们厂今年的生产总值要比去年提高151.02％，上缴利润要比去年提高41.97％，劳动生产率要比去年提高68.08％。可是，这些控制数字经过群众讨论后，都被突破了，再经过上级的核定，现在的国家计划比原来的控制数字在生产总值方面又提高了6.64％，在上缴利润方面又提高了2.74％，我想这些数字已经足够地说明今年我们厂的工业生产比去年有了多大的提高！为了保证这个计划的实现，在今年一月召开的职工代表会议上，我们专门研究了推广先进经验的问题，加强技术文化教育的问题和改善劳动保护的问题。在这次会议以后，厂里的社会主义竞赛有了更加蓬勃的发展。女铣工沈淑娟也说：“我一个人要做两部机床，半年任务提前二月完成”。过去只是工人参加竞赛，现在科室的技术人员、职员也积极地投入竞赛热潮中了。科室与科室之间，车间与车间之间订立了联系合同，老师傅保证带好徒弟，科室帮助车间解决计划、技术问题。技术人员赵亦声说：“过去我们下车间，东挨西靠，插不上手，现在你帮我，我帮你，大家打成一片，工作劲头足了。”在竞赛中，大家互相学习，互相帮助，出现了很多先进的事例：如叶根小组组长陈伟钧等，通过定额员帮助算细账后，自动压缩定额，加快了走刀量，由每天14车（每车18片）提高到每天19车，保证每天的产量由252片提高到342片；又如劳动模范庄永林装配喷咀原来定额是3小时半1只，今年1月份修改定额后是2小时1只，车间工段长认为定额提得太高，要求加他10分钟到20分钟，但经过全年计划讨论，庄永林与陈太鸿非但没有要求降低新的定额，而且主动提出新定额还可以再压缩10分钟1只；大件工段车工曹福寿一次提出了合理化建议21件；铸钢车间经过全车间职工讨论后提出了22条措施，保证7个月完成全年的任务。汽轮机车间宋万庆也在上海机床厂盛利的帮助下，高速切削速度达到1，300多公尺，这样的例子是很多的。正因为这样，所以今年我厂第一季度执行国家计划的实际情况是良好的：生产总值完成计划123％，商品总值完成107％，劳动生产率完成122％，利润总额和上缴利润完成100％，而且到今年五月底我厂已经达到了1957年的各项主要生产指标。拿汽轮机来说，国家规定1957年的水平是84，500瓩，到今年五月底止，我们已经完成了92，500瓩，超过了1957年的指标。现在，我们厂里正在进一步为争取全面提前完成国家规定的五年计划累计数字而努力，并保证在今年十一月底就提前完成。
    随着生产的不断发展，我厂职工人数比1949年增加了8.8倍；厂房面积比1949年增加了12.2倍，今年还将扩建工人宿舍；同时，工人的福利亦相应地有了发展。
    上海汽轮机厂存在的问题
    在李先念副总理的报告中指出：为了实现1956年的国家预算，目前在工业生产方面特别需要注意纠正一部分企业片面地追求“多”和“快”，而没有同样地着重“好”、“省”和“安全”的倾向；在李富春副总理的发言中，也提到在第一个五年计划的执行中所发生过的一些缺点和错误，我认为他们所指出的问题是必要的和正确的，也是符合我厂的实际情况的。我厂在几年来虽然已经取得了一些成绩，但同时还存在着不少的缺点和问题：从领导方面来看，对于全厂职工的社会主义积极性还估计不足。如去年一年完成了6台汽轮机，可是在原来计划时只订了3台；又如到今年五月份已经达到了1957年的生产水平，提前19个月完成计划，就是一个明显的例子。其次，全厂职工的社会主义劳动热情大大提高了，但是企业的领导管理水平赶不上去，特别是计划方面的问题还很多，往往在月初松时工人没有事做，把他们东拉西扯，在月底紧时就要工人加班加点。从技术工作来看，国家要我们在12年内赶上先进国家的水平，但我们的“修配”思想还没有完全克服；对于新近进厂的工人，技术还没有学好，就要他们干活，不重视对他们的技术教育，以致造成了很多废品。对于职工的生活福利注意得不够，特别是工人住宅问题十分严重，在我们厂里三分之二的工人还得不到家属宿舍，工人也反映“我们的食堂像蒸笼”，一进食堂就吃不下饭。据我了解，今年有很多工厂虽然已经有建筑职工宿舍的预算，但是因为买不到建筑材料，计划变成落空。我深切地希望有关部门能够适当地解决广大职工这个迫切的问题。在安全生产方面问题更加严重。我厂今年的工伤事故特别多，第一季度出了工伤事故29件，经常有工人压伤手脚，有一个工人因为废钢没有经过仔细的清理引起爆炸而死掉。问题之所以这样严重，主要是因为在领导思想上只重生产不重安全，抓了生产任务而忽视了其他方面。我认为以上这些毛病都应该在今后引起注意并努力加以改正，这对于进一步发挥我们职工群众的积极性和创造性是十分必要的。
    各位代表！自从全国总工会召开了先进生产者代表会议以后，现在全国的先进生产者运动已经更加深入地开展起来了，特别对于学习和运用先进经验已经引起了广大职工的兴趣和热情，现在上海市正在工业展览会中举办先进经验的训练班，许多工业部门都培养出一批推广先进经验的骨干分子。由于先进生产者运动的强大发展，我们广大职工，有信心一定能够提早和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划，这也就是我们广大职工对于1956年国家预算最有力的支持。
    对农村工作的意见
    1、对农业合作社播种农作物不要规定得过于机械
    2、推广先进农作物要防止一般化和行政命令的毛病
    3、城市用垃圾供应给农村作为肥料，要重视质量
    其次，在邓子恢副总理的发言中，提到在农业合作化运动中所存在的错误和缺点，我也完全同意。我本人是个工人，但我家里是农民，所以我对农村的情况比较熟悉，在这里，我也要对农村工作中的问题，提出三点意见：
    1．有些地区对农业合作社播种农作物规定得过于机械。像我们厂在闵行，离上海市有50多里路，而职工吃的小菜每天要用汽车到上海去买。因为闵行一带规定为产稻产棉区，所以社里只重视增产粮食和棉花，而没有随着工厂的发展与工人的增加，相适应地增加蔬菜的生产。另方面，农民的意见很多，他们反映：“种一亩萝卜收成好的话可以卖300多元，而且种下去三个月就可以卖；种一亩小白菜只要一个月就可收成。但是种一亩稻却要六个月，收入至多七、八十元，这样，结果工人弟兄吃不到便宜菜，农民减少收入，国家浪费了车辆汽油，大家都得不到好处。”
    2．在推广先进农作物时，有一般化和行政命令的毛病。像马桥区今年推广双季稻，没有考虑到土质、气候、种子是否适宜，就用行政命令的方式来推广。但结果呢？在我这次动身到北京来的时候，田里第一次种下去的稻还生长不起来，农民都很着急“今年第二季度也不能种了”，只好把百分之九十种下去的稻用牛来耕掉，农民朱根祥含着眼泪对我说：“推广双季稻，本来是一件好事体，而现在却要我们一亩田损失十块钱（十斤稻种谷、一次肥料、加上人工），而今年种的晚稻，肥料还成问题”。他还说：“我们晓得国家有困难，不能在各地成立研究所，可是在你们还没有把握的时候，为啥不先叫我们试种几十亩，然后再推广，就不致造成这样地步”。
    3．城市用垃圾供应给农村作为肥料的工作中，不重视质量，有关领导部门有官僚主义作风。去年，我刚到马桥区去视察，农民朱书祥就对我说：“城市人真不讲理，连垃圾也欺侮到我们农民头上”。我后来一了解，原来农民在强迫命令的情况下，化了一元二角钱一吨的代价买来的垃圾，其中有50％是煤灰，10％是玻璃、破碗、碎砖和洋铁罐头等。农民买回来后，一吨垃圾化上一天去拣也拣不完，用到田里去后，往往使农民和耕牛发生伤害事故。农民不能眼看着好好的田，白白地弄坏，只好把化钱买来的垃圾堆积在江的两岸，足足有几百吨，让它浪费掉。后来，我曾经写过信反映给上海市人民代表大会秘书处和上海县县长办公室，要求加以注意，但以后没有回音，不知解决了没有。
