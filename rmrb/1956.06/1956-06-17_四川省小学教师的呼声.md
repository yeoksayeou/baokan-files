To the Editor:

I want to reflect to the People's Daily the common opinions of the broad masses of elementary school teachers in Sichuan Province. From these opinions, it can be seen that the Party and government leading organs in some areas have adopted an attitude of indifference or even unreasonable discrimination towards elementary school teachers. In order to make elementary school teachers love their work and better cultivate the next generation of the motherland, these problems should arouse universal attention and be effectively resolved.

	Why Do Party and League Organizations Close
			Their Doors to Elementary School Teachers?

In recent years, under the education of the Party, the political consciousness of elementary school teachers has generally improved, and many people are eager to join the Party and the League. According to incomplete statistics, in Nanbu County, 11% of elementary school teachers have applied to join the Party, and 34% have applied to join the League, some even writing more than ten applications. In Nanchong County, among more than 1,900 elementary school teachers, more than 1,800 have bought "How to Be a Communist" to read, and some schools have even automatically organized Party class study groups for learning. Similar situations exist in other regions.

However, Party and League organizations in many areas lack a correct assessment and specific analysis of the political situation of elementary school teachers, and are not concerned enough about the demands of elementary school teachers to join the Party and the League. Therefore, the work of Party and League building among elementary school teachers has not been done well.

In Meishan County, eight teachers applied to join the Party at the prefectural elementary school teacher representative meeting in 1954 (because in the past, this prefecture often determined the targets for developing Party and League members at representative meetings). At that time, the relevant leading comrades told them to talk about it after returning to the county. However, for more than a year, no one had spoken to them even once. In Longchang County, there are more than 1,000 elementary school teachers, but only eight Party members were developed until January last year, and the work of Party building has stagnated since then. In the Central Street Elementary School of this county, there are 30 teachers, of whom seven want to join the Party and five have written applications, but the relevant Party organization has never asked about this matter. In this situation, teachers everywhere generally reflect: "Writing an application to join the Party is like a stone falling into the water!"

The work of developing the League has the same phenomenon as above. In the suburbs of Chengdu, there are a total of 176 young teachers, but only three League members were developed until 1955. Young teacher Zhang Xinrong has applied to join the League three times since 1952, but none of them have been approved. What is the reason? Luo Jialin, secretary of the League General Branch, said: "Our suburban general branch committee members live very scattered, and there is no time to verify the materials"; "Those who actively want to join the League do not show why they want to join." Chen Yuqian, a young female teacher at Xinzheng Elementary School in Nanbu County, has applied to join the League eight times since 1952, and the branch meeting has also passed the resolution to admit her to the League, but the county and district League committees doubted the authenticity of her family background (middle peasant component), and without investigation, decided not to approve it. Later, Chen Yuqian took the initiative to contact the Party organization in her original籍貫 place and wrote a certificate, but Li Zheng'an, secretary of the District League Committee, said: "We have to test her for another year before developing her!" County and district cadres should not discriminate against elementary school teachers.

In some areas, the phenomenon of discrimination against elementary school teachers is still quite serious. Even district and township cadres can arbitrarily assign tasks or impose punishments on elementary school teachers. For example, the propaganda cadre of the Siyi District of Langzhong County believed that elementary school teachers did not pay attention to the central work, so he independently stipulated that they should be tested every two or three weeks. Once, at a cadres' meeting in Yixing Township, Xichong County, an elementary school teacher was a little late, and Ren Yingguo, a staff member of the township, punished the teacher by making him stand at attention and listen to the entire report. When Yang Fuqing, a staff member of the Sanguan District of Nanbu County, was working in Sanguan Township last year, he called elementary school teachers to go to the village to deliver notices protecting the cattle in the middle of the night. One teacher was sick and had not eaten all day, but was also forced to go. In this way, the four elementary school teachers ran until dawn, and then had to go to teach the students. Once, when Yang Fuqing borrowed the school site to hold a mass meeting, a student accidentally dropped an inkstone on the ground, and he burst into abuse, saying that "there are counter-revolutionaries in the school destroying things!" The teachers were so frightened that they had to reluctantly admit their mistakes. The People's Committee of Shengzhong District, Nanbu County, also stipulated that elementary school teachers should be on duty to investigate the warehouse every four days, and the teachers on duty could hardly sleep all night.

In addition, elementary school teachers in some counties and districts are also subjected to undue discrimination in terms of medical care and hygiene. For example, elementary school teachers in Neijiang City reported that the leaders of the health section criticized them for being ideologically backward when they saw them going to the doctor, and even criticized the principal for not grasping the principles. The doctor at the Eighth District Health Center in Changshou County said: "It is difficult to treat elementary school teachers. If I prescribe more expensive medicine, I may be criticized; if I don't prescribe it, I can't cure the disease!"

	Give Elementary School Teachers Time for Lesson Preparation and Further Study.

In addition, many elementary school teachers have too many concurrent jobs and too heavy burdens, and even on Sundays they are busy attending meetings or participating in other social activities. For example, Yang Wenyuan, the principal of Longshi Town Elementary School in Longchang County, concurrently serves as the director of the Teaching Union District Office, secretary of the League branch, leader of the study center group, member of the new teaching material county teaching and research group, leader of the district teaching and research group, member of the district culture, education and health committee, and member of the private school school affairs committee, holding seven positions. Last semester, he attended a three-week meeting in the province, a three-week meeting in the county, and the culture and education section also transferred him to conduct two weeks of inspection work. Even in the ten weeks he was at school, he spent four weeks cooperating with the culture and education section in summarizing work. This situation is very common. What are the results of being so busy? On the one hand, elementary school teachers cannot be guaranteed time to prepare lessons, and it is impossible to carry out spare-time advanced studies smoothly, which affects the improvement of teacher quality. On the other hand, some elementary school teachers do not get enough rest, and their health has been damaged. Although this is an old problem, it is still prevalent now and should be solved quickly.

### 四川省小学教师的呼声

    四川省小学教师的呼声编辑同志：
    我要向人民日报反映一下四川省广大小学教师的共同意见。从这些意见中可以看出，有些地区的党、政领导机关对小学教师采取了漠不关心甚至无理歧视的态度。为了使小学教师热爱他们的工作，更好地培养祖国的第二代，这些问题应该引起普遍的重视并且得到有效的解决。
  为什么党、团组织要向小学
          教师关门
    几年来，在党的教育下，小学教师的政治觉悟普遍提高了，很多人迫切要求入党入团。据不完全的统计，南部县已经有11％的小学教师申请入党，34％的小学教师申请入团，有的甚至已经写了十多次申请书。南充县一千九百多名小学教师中，有一千八百多人买了“怎样做一个共产党员”来阅读，有的学校还自动组织党课学习小组来进行学习。其它地区也有类似的情况。
    但是不少地区的党、团组织对于小学教师的政治情况缺乏正确的估计和具体的分析，对于小学教师入党入团的要求不够关心，因此在小学教师中的建党、建团工作都做得很不好。
    眉山县有八个教师在1954年专区召开的小学教师代表会议上申请入党（因为过去这个专区经常在代表会议上确定发展党团员的对象），当时有关领导同志叫他们回县以后再说。但是一年多来，谁也没找他们谈过一次话。隆昌县共有小学教师一千多人，直到去年一月份才发展了八个党员，而且以后建党工作又停顿了。这个县的中心街小学有教师三十人，其中七人要求入党，五人写了申请书，但是有关党组织就从来没有过问这件事。在这种情况下，各地教师普遍反映：“写了入党申请书，等于石头掉在水里一样！”
    发展团的工作同样有上述现象。成都市郊区共有青年教师176人，直到1955年才发展了三个团员。青年教师张新容从1952年以来曾经三次申请入团，但是都没有被批准。理由是什么呢？团总支书记罗家麟说：“我们郊区的总支委员住得很分散，没有时间去对证材料”；“积极要求入团的人，看不出他们是为什么”。南部县新政小学青年女教师陈玉倩，从1952年以来曾经八次申请入团，支部大会也曾经通过吸收她入团，但是县、区团委怀疑她交代的家庭出身（中农成份）不真实，也没有进行调查，就决定不批准。以后，陈玉倩主动和她原籍的党组织取得联系，并写了证明材料，但是团区委书记李正安却说：“还要考验一年再发展！”县、区干部不应当歧视小学教师
    在有些地区，歧视小学教师的现象仍然相当严重，甚至区、乡干部可以任意给小学教师分派任务或者进行处罚。像阆中县思依区的宣传干事认为小学教师不重视中心工作，就自行规定每两三个星期要对他们进行考试一次。西充县义兴乡有一次开干部会，一个小学教师迟到了一会儿，乡里的工作人员任映国就罚这个教师立正听完报告。南部县三官区的工作人员杨甫清去年在三官乡工作的时候，曾在半夜里叫小学教师下村去送保护耕牛的通知。有一个教师有病，一天都没有吃饭，也被逼着去了。就这样，四个小学教师一直跑到天亮，接着还得去给学生上课。有一次，杨甫清借用小学校址开群众会议，有个学生不小心，把砚台掉在地下，他就破口大骂，说是“学校里有反革命分子破坏！”吓得教师们只好委曲地认错。南部县升种区人民委员会还规定小学教师每隔四天要值班调查仓库一次，值班的教师几乎一整夜不能睡觉。
    另外，有些县、区的小学教师在医疗卫生方面也受到不应有的歧视。像内江市的小学教师反映：卫生科的领导人员看到小学教师去医病，就批评他们思想落后，甚至批评校长不掌握原则。长寿县第八区卫生所的医生说：“给小学教师治病困难，开了价钱比较高的药，就可能受到批评；不开吧，又治不了病！”
  让小学教师有备课和进修时间
    另外，有不少小学教师兼职过多，负担过重，甚至星期日也忙于开会或参加其它社会活动。如隆昌县龙市镇小学校长杨文渊身兼教联区办事处主任、团支部书记、学习中心组长、新教材县教研组委员、区教研组长、区文教卫生委员和民校校务委员七职，上学期他在省里开了三星期的会，在县里开了三星期的会，文教科还把他调去搞了两星期的视导工作，就是在学校的十个星期中，还有四个星期是配合文教科在总结工作。这种情况是很普遍的。忙乱的结果怎样呢？一方面，小学教师备课的时间不能得到保证，业余进修也无法顺利进行，这就影响教师质量的提高；另一方面，有些小学教师得不到充分的休息，健康已经受到了损害。这虽然是个老问题，但是现在仍然普遍存在，应该赶快解决才好。　陈联文（附图片）
