Short Films – The Agile Weapon of Film Art
—Reflections on the Japanese Film Shorts Collection "It Is Precisely For Love"
Ji Jia

Short films – small works of film art – are the most agile weapons of film art for quickly reflecting reality and participating in social struggles. One of their combat characteristics is their brevity. As seen in this collection of Japanese film shorts, "It Is Precisely For Love": the shortest, "The Flower Girl," is less than two thousand feet long; the longest, "It Is Precisely For Love," is also less than four thousand feet long. This brevity inevitably imposes strict limitations on the capacity of the short film's content. However, this does not mean that content can be lacking or minimal, nor does it mean that the depiction can be superficial or crude. We see that the three short films included in "It Is Precisely For Love"—"It Is Precisely For Love," "The Bride Who Flew In," and "The Flower Girl"—are very rich in content, wonderful, and moving. They write complete stories with dramatic plots and portray real and vivid characters like the mother Yaeko, the bride Kuniko and her fiancé Kono, and the hostess Michie. Through these, they sharply touch upon issues of urgent social significance—the question of the Japanese people's lives and destinies. That is: Under the armed occupation of American imperialism, in the dark environment full of disasters such as unemployment, poverty, and lack of freedom caused by the post-war situation in Japan, how do the broad masses of the Japanese people live, and how can they live reasonably...

Such short works are still rare in our country, so the creative characteristics of these three short films are particularly worthy of our reference and learning.

As a form of film art, short films, like feature films, use film art techniques to vividly reflect reality. However, due to the difference in form—length—they inevitably have different characteristics and requirements in creation. The primary one is that short films especially require a high degree of concentration of content and very concise and refined descriptions. Judging from these three short films, this is precisely the case.

For example, a subject like "It Is Precisely For Love" could also be written into a feature film, that is, bringing the biography of the protagonist's mother's entire life, or the full picture of the various life struggles she experienced in the period before and after the "May First Incident," to the screen. However, here its task is only to highlight a page from the mother's biography, a portrait of her entire life struggle. Therefore, it only shows an encounter she experienced in a short period after the "May First Incident," mainly a small family storm caused by the impact of her son being arrested and imprisoned. At the same time, it only grasps a segment, a link, from the development of contradictions and conflicts to depict it, thereby highlighting the mother's image and the central idea of the work. That is: In the face of difficulties in family life, what is more important is that the eldest daughter does not understand her brother politically and only wants to leave her for personal happiness; the uncle who works in the bank encourages her to persuade her son to "turn around"; and she herself, although she knows that her son has done nothing wrong, is very much looking forward to her son's early release from prison... In the face of such contradictions, how should this kind mother treat her revolutionary son, that is, how should she treat the great struggle for national independence and peace, and how should she connect her family life happiness with this struggle? The film answered through the mother's actions.

The other two short films are even shorter. However, each segment and link they focus on can evoke many segments and links. Their few dialogues and seemingly narrow scenes also arouse many associations. The extremely peculiar event in "The Bride Who Flew In" of "sending the bride like sending a letter with the letter" not only implies the fate of the protagonist, but also implies the bankruptcy of the vast rural areas of Japan today. As for the bouquet of flowers and bunch of grapes in "The Flower Girl," they cannot help but remind people of the encounters of millions of ordinary Japanese people today: they are in a state of widespread unemployment and extreme poverty, struggling painfully to survive...

It can be seen from the above examples that concentrating on one point in content, arousing the audience's associations, and hinting to the audience the rest of reality—this is the biggest characteristic that these three excellent short films have in common in their creation.

Another biggest and most important characteristic of these three short films lies in the fact that their reflection of reality is rapid and timely. By means of specific images, they raise social issues that urgently need to be resolved by millions of people in reality, and they make sharp criticisms of the current society. It can be said that the works have the characteristics of social commentary-style essays and brilliantly play the combat role of small artistic weapons.

Admittedly, these three short films only touch on some small things in the daily lives of ordinary people, some ordinary or even individual phenomena. There are neither shocking plots nor magnificent scenes in them. But these are by no means trivial matters around us. These events come from the depths of people's lives and reflect the lives and spiritual outlook of people from broad strata of Japanese society. They have thousands of inextricable links with the entire national life and social struggle. Therefore, when the filmmakers examine and analyze them from the entire social contradiction, from the fate of the Japanese people and the entire situation of Japanese society, they keenly and deeply see the big things from the small things and discover the moving and universal things from the ordinary and individual phenomena. In this way, after selection, refinement, and excavation, they found the great social significance of these subjects and the basis of true dramatic conflict, thereby accurately and powerfully raising social issues.

For example, in the short film "It Is Precisely For Love," what seems on the surface to be just a small family storm caused by life difficulties actually contains sharp social content: because this storm is related to the major political struggle of the "May First Incident" and the peace and democracy movement against American imperialism, this storm is not a simple family problem, but is stirred up by the entire Japanese situation, mainly the political countercurrent in Japan in recent years. Every Japanese family and every Japanese person can encounter such personal issues with social significance every day. The characteristic of the work's commentary-style essay lies in the fact that it rapidly and timely reflects this issue, arousing people's vigilance and concern. It solemnly raises it through specific images: In the face of such a situation, how should people treat their national independence, freedom, and peace cause, and how should they treat their family life.

From here, it can also be seen that the work's characteristic of commentary-style essay is produced by the work's requirement to reflect reality and participate in real struggles, that is, by the work's ideological and artistic tasks. The task of the short film "It Is Precisely For Love" is neither to exclusively discuss "family issues" nor to generally discuss the impact of the "May First Incident." It expresses its criticism of society from such an angle, that is, from the impact and changes of the "May First Incident" on a family, mainly on the psychological and spiritual aspects of a mother. Since the work's commentary-style essay characteristic is produced by the work's specific ideological and artistic tasks, this point must be consciously grasped in the creation. For example, from the tragic encounter of its protagonist, the short film "The Bride Who Flew In" could have become a tragedy like those commonly seen. However, it did not do so. On the contrary, it not only has an unexpected comedic ending, but the entire plot is full of descriptions of "containing seriousness in humor." The comedic effect here is expressed in such an artistic plot: in the tragic encounter, under heavy pressure, how do the kind and simple protagonists not succumb to fate and how do they unite in a common fate? The author gave such characters the highest sympathy. Here, the work does not directly accuse and attack society, but the entire description of this work actually implies the unreasonableness and all the distorted faces of this era and this society in Japan more strongly and more sharply, reaching its satire and criticism of society.

The commentary-style essay characteristic is also very significant in "The Flower Girl," a short film full of tragic content. The reason why this short film has become a sketch like a scene-by-scene story, instead of positively showing the tragic facts and scenes such as unemployment, suicide, poverty, and death, also lies in the task of the work: it only needs to quickly convey its criticism of the current Japanese society that caused their tragic fate by sketching the tragic encounters of the flower girl and the hostess and the interactions between them. It accuses and attacks the society where "flowers can't live either, they have to be suffocated to death." It accuses and attacks the reactionary forces that created this situation. In the description of the sympathy, friendship, and care between the flower girl and the hostess, the short film encourages kind people: "Don't be weak! Don't succumb to society!" To "muster up courage and live bravely!" The short film's positive and direct expression of its ideas is of great political significance and political combat power.

Although, in the short film, the audience only sees a portrait of the protagonists' biography and a side of their multifaceted lives. However, this portrait is clear, full of unique personality characteristics and a strong sense of life.

We cannot forget such a portrait: In the short film "It Is Precisely For Love," when the eldest daughter is about to leave the family, the mother's mood is very complicated, intertwined with love for her children and worries about family affairs: she is unwilling for her eldest daughter to leave her relatives so quickly, and she is also unwilling for her to be so unfair and inhumane to her brothers—these make her sad; however, she cannot bear to blame her eldest daughter, she hides her grief and says to her eldest daughter with great consideration: "I'm sorry, Minzi! I made you suffer alone..." She shed tears, and enduring the tears, she said: "Go, it's getting late, Minzi! Mother will send you the big package tomorrow. Go!..." Here, the short film's description of the psychological and emotional changes of this kind mother is extremely human and extremely detailed, not only making people feel the reality of life, but also being moved by this reality.

The success of short films in portraying character images is first and foremost because these images are real. These images reveal the true face of the kind, hardworking, and peace-loving ordinary Japanese people. Although they have suffered disasters under the American armed occupation, and although modern Japanese society is suffocating to the point where even flowers cannot survive, they have become increasingly awakened and have spiritually stood up. This aspect of the short film's description and its profound implications are undoubtedly of important social, era, and combat significance in Japan today.

We learn with gratitude from these three short films, these excellent works produced by Japanese independent film production units in extremely difficult environments. We also pay tribute to all the excellent Japanese national film makers and expect them to make greater contributions to the struggle for Japanese national independence, freedom, and peace, and to the defense of Japanese national culture and art and Japanese national cinema.

    短片——电影艺术的轻便武器
    ——日本电影短片集“正是为了爱”观后感
    贾霁
    短片——电影艺术小型作品，是电影艺术迅速反映现实、参与社会斗争的最轻便的武器。它的战斗性的特征之一，是它的短小。像在这部日本电影短片集——“正是为了爱”中所看见的：最短的一个“卖花姑娘”，长度就不到二千呎；最长的一个“正是为了爱”，长度也不到四千呎。这种短小，自然不能不使短片内容的容量受到严格的限制。然而这并不意味着可以缺少或者很少内容，也不意味着描写可以浮浅，可以简陋。我们看，“正是为了爱”这部短片集中包括的三个短片“正是为了爱”、“飞来的新娘子”和“卖花姑娘”，就很有内容，很精彩，很动人。它们写出了结构完整、有戏剧性情节的故事，描绘出了像母亲八重子、新娘子国子和她的未婚夫河野以及女招待道江这些真实、生动的形象；并且通过这些，尖锐地接触到了具有迫切社会意义的问题——日本人民生活命运的问题，这就是：在美帝国主义武装占领之下，在日本战后局面所造成的失业、贫困、不自由等等灾难重重的黑暗的环境里面，广大的日本人民如何生活、以及如何合理地生活下去……
    像这样短小的作品，在我国还是不多见的，因而这三个短片在创作方面的特点，特别值得我们借鉴，值得我们学习。
    作为一种电影艺术形式，短片与长片一样，是用电影艺术手段，形象地反映现实。但由于形式——长度不同，就不能不带给它们在创作上各自不同的特点和要求。这首要的就是：短片特别需要内容的高度集中，描写的十分简洁、精炼。从这三个短片看来，正是这样。
    例如：“正是为了爱”，这样的题材也可以写成一部长片，即把其中主人公母亲一生的传记，或者把她在“五一事件”前后一个时期所经历的种种生活斗争的全貌搬上银幕；但是，在这里它的任务却只是把这位母亲传记中的一页，把她全部生活斗争中的一幅肖像突现出来；所以，它只表现了她在“五一事件”以后短短时间内的一个遭遇，主要是由于儿子被捕入狱的影响所引起的家庭成员之间的一个小小风波。同时，它只是从矛盾和冲突的发展中，紧紧抓住一个片段、一个环节来加以描绘，从而把母亲的形象和作品的中心思想突现出来。这就是：在家庭生活困难面前，更重要的是在大女儿在政治上对兄弟不理解，并且只为个人幸福而要离开她；在银行做事的叔叔怂恿她去劝儿子“转向”；而她自己虽然明知儿子没有过错，却又十分盼望儿子早日出狱……等等矛盾面前，这位善良的母亲应该怎样对待革命的儿子，也就是应该怎样对待自己的民族独立和平的伟大斗争，以及怎样把自己的家庭生活幸福和这个斗争联系起来？影片通过这位母亲的行动，作了回答。
    其它两个短片就更加简短。但是，它们每一个所集中表现的一个片段、一个环节，却可以使人联想起许多片段、许多环节。它们为数不多的对话和看来狭窄的场景里面，也引起人们许多联想。“飞来的新娘子”中“把新娘子像寄信似的随着信给送来了”这件极其奇特的事情，不仅隐喻着主人公个人的命运，也隐喻着今天日本广大农村的破产的情况。至于，“卖花姑娘”中的那一束花、一串葡萄，也使人不由地想起今天千百万日本普通人民的遭遇：他们处在普遍失业和极其贫困的境地，在痛苦地挣扎着要求活下去……
    从以上举例中，可以看出：在内容上集中一点，引起观众联想，并暗示观众以现实的其余的部分——这就是这三个优秀的短片在创作上共同具有的一个最大的特色。
    这三个短片又一个最大的也是最重要的特色，在于它们对于现实的反映，是迅速的、及时的；是借着特定的形象提出了现实中千百万人民迫切需要解决的社会问题，并对于当前社会提出了尖锐的批判。可以说，作品带着社会时评性质的小品文色彩，出色地发挥了小型艺术武器的战斗的作用。
    诚然，这三个短片所接触的只是普通人民日常生活中的一些小事，一些平凡的以至个别的现象；其中既没有惊人的情节，也没有雄伟的场面。但这些决不是身边琐事。这些事件，是来自人民生活的深处，是反映了日本广泛阶层的人民生活和精神面貌的；它们与整个国家生活和社会斗争有着千丝万缕的、不可分割的联系。所以，当影片的制作者们从整个社会矛盾，从当代日本人民生活命运和日本社会的整个形势来加以考察、进行分析的时候，他们就敏锐地、深刻地从小的东西看到了大的东西，从平凡的和个别的现象发现了动人的和普遍的东西。这样，经过选择、提炼和挖掘，就找到了这些题材的重大的社会意义，找到了真正的戏剧性冲突的基础，从而准确地并且有力地提出了社会问题。
    例如：在“正是为了爱”这个短片里，它那表面看来不过是由生活困难引起的一个家庭的一场小风波，实际是蕴藏着尖锐的社会内容：因为这风波是与“五一事件”这个重大的政治斗争、与反对美帝国主义的和平民主运动相联系的，这风波并非简单的家庭问题，而是由整个日本时局、主要是近年来日本的政治逆流激起的。每一个日本家庭、每一个日本人每一天都可以碰到这类带有社会意义的切身问题。作品的时评小品色彩，就在于它是迅速及时地反映了这个问题，促起人民的警惕和关心。它借着特定的形象，郑重地提出来：在这样的时局面前，人们应该怎样对待自己的民族独立自由和和平事业，又怎样对待自己的家庭生活。
    从这里，也可以看出：作品的时评小品色彩，是由作品反映现实、参与现实斗争的要求所产生的，也就是由作品的思想艺术任务所产生的。“正是为了爱”这个短片的任务，既不是专论“家庭问题”，也不是泛论“五一事件”的影响；它是从这样一个角度，即从“五一事件”对于一个家庭、主要是对于一个母亲心理上精神上的影响和变化，来发抒它对于社会的批判。作品的这种时评小品色彩，既然是由作品的特定的思想艺术任务所产生的，因此在创作中就要有意识地掌握这一点。例如：“飞来的新娘子”这个短片，从它的主人公的悲剧遭遇来说，是可以成为一个像通常见的那样的悲剧的；然而，它没有那样做；相反，不仅有一个意外的喜剧的结局，并且在全部剧情中充满了“寓庄于谐”的描写。这里的喜剧效果，是在这样的艺术情节中表现出来的，就是：在悲剧的遭遇中，在沉重的压力下，善良而纯朴的主人公们是怎样地不屈服于命运，又怎样地在共同命运中结合起来。作者以最高的同情给了这样的人物。在这里，作品并没有正面地直接地控诉和抨击社会，然而，整个作品的这种描写，实际上是把日本的这个年代这个社会的不合理和全部畸形面貌更强烈地更尖锐地暗示了出来，达到了它对于社会的讽刺和批判。
    时评小品色彩，在“卖花姑娘”这个充满悲剧内容的短片中，也很显著。这个短片之所以成为现在这种即景故事一般的速写，而不去正面表现例如失业自杀、贫困病死这些悲惨的事实和情景，也在于作品的任务是：只需要就卖花姑娘和女招待的悲剧遭遇和她们之间的交往这个短短的速写，来迅速传达它对于造成她们悲剧命运的当前日本社会的批判。它控诉、抨击那个“花也同样活不了，也得被闷死”的社会；它控诉、抨击那个造成这种局面的反动势力。在关于卖花姑娘和女招待之间的同情、友爱、关怀的描写中，短片鼓励着善良的人们：“不要软弱！不要向社会屈服！”要“鼓起勇气来，勇敢地活下去！”短片这样正面而直接地表达了它的思想，是很有政治意义和政治战斗力的。
    虽然，在短片中，观众看到的只是主人公们传记中的一幅肖像和多方面生活中的一个侧面。但是，这肖像是清晰的，富有独特的个性特征和浓郁的生活气息的。
    我们不能忘记这样的肖像：在“正是为了爱”这个短片里，当大女儿要离开家庭的时候，母亲的心情十分复杂，交织着对儿女的爱和家事的忧烦：她不情愿大女儿那样快地丢开亲人走掉，她也不愿意她对兄弟那样不公平和不近人情，——这些使她伤心；然而，她却不忍责备大女儿，她隐藏着哀痛，万分体贴地对大女儿说：“对不起你，敏子！竟叫你一个人受苦……她流泪了，又忍着泪，说：“走吧，天不早了，敏子！大包裹，明天妈妈给你送去。去吧！……”在这里，短片对这位慈祥的母亲心理和感情变化的描写，极有人情，也极细致，不只使人感到生活的真实，而且为这真实所感动。
    短片在刻划人物形象方面的这种成功，首先和根本上因为：这些形象是真实的。这些形象揭示出：善良、勤劳、热爱生活、热爱和平的日本普通人民的真的面貌，尽管在美国武装占领之下备受灾难，尽管现代日本社会是窒息得连花也活不下去，但是他们已经日益觉醒，在精神上站了起来。短片这一方面的描写和它的深长的寓意，在今天日本来说，无疑是具有重要的社会的、时代的意义和战斗的意义的。
    我们以感激的心情，来学习这三个短片，这由日本独立制片单位在极其艰苦的环境里制作出的优秀作品。我们对所有优秀的日本民族电影制作者同时致以敬意，并期待他们在为日本民族独立自由和和平的斗争中，为保卫日本民族文化艺术和日本民族电影作出更大的贡献。
