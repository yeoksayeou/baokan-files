    Second Match Between Chinese and French Basketball Teams
    (Our newspaper reported on the 8th) Tonight, the French "Labor League" men's and women's basketball teams, invited to our country, and the Chinese "August 1st" men's and women's basketball teams held two exciting friendly matches at the Beijing Gymnasium. As a result of the matches, the "August 1st" men's and women's basketball teams won with scores of 75-47 and 71-52 respectively.
    After the women's team match began, the "Labor League" team adopted cross-screen tactics, opening up the opponent's defense, and scoring with cuts to the basket and mid-range shots. The "August 1st" women's team used multiple passes, jumping to shoot as soon as they found an opening. Ge Lili and Zhou Zhengyun scored many points with mid-range shots.
    The men's team match, which attracted the attention of the capital's audience, saw the "August 1st" team, which is good at fast breaks, implement rapid attacks from the start. At the same time, they tried their best to use mid-range jump shots and forwards snatching the ball under the basket and turning to shoot, posing a great threat to the visiting team. The "Labor League" men's team played very well today. In defense, they adopted the method of quickly retreating to the mid-court and zonal defense to prevent the "August 1st" team's fast breaks and the center's leaping and turning shots. In offense, they used continuous cross-screens to skillfully dodge the opponent's guards and cut to the basket. Cremonini, Klemar, and Rosati's dribbling and cutting shots and turning shots under the basket won warm applause from the audience.

    中法篮球队第二次比赛
    本报8日讯　今晚，应邀来我国的法国“劳联”男女篮球队和我国“八一”男女篮球队在北京体育馆举行了两场精彩的友谊比赛。比赛结果，“八一”男女篮球队分别以七十五比四十七和七十一比五十二获胜。
    女队比赛开始后，“劳联”队采用了交叉掩护战术，拉开对方的防线，用篮下切入和中距离投篮得分。“八一”女队则利用多传球，一找到空隙便跳起投篮。葛莉莉和周正云中距离投篮得分不少。
    吸引着首都观众的男队比赛一开始，擅长快攻的“八一”队便实行快速进攻，同时尽量利用中距离跳起投篮、前锋抢夺篮下球转身投篮等方法，给客队很大的威胁。“劳联”男队今天打得十分出色，在防守时采用迅速退回中场和区域联防的方法，阻止“八一”队的快攻和中锋跃起反身投篮。在进攻时则利用接连不断的交叉掩护，巧妙地闪过对方的后卫，切入篮下。克雷莫尼尼、克莱马尔、罗萨蒂的过人切入投篮和篮下转身投篮技术博得观众的热烈掌声。
