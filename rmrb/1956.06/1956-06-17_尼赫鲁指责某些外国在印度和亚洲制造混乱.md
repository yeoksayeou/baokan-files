Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 15th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in a speech on June 14th, called on the Indian people to be vigilant against certain foreign countries using divisive forces to weaken India and Asia.

    He said at a mass meeting in Rohtak, Punjab, that he knew some newspapers that incited chaos and conflict, especially some newspapers in Delhi and Punjab, were receiving financial subsidies from some foreign countries. He said: "Certain foreign countries want to see conflicts and disputes in our country expand because they disagree with some of our policies."

    Nehru also talked about news published in certain newspapers in Ceylon, which stated that the recent disturbances in Ceylon regarding the language issue were instigated by foreign countries. He said that certain foreign countries do not like to see Asian countries become strong, and they spend money to spread chaos in these newly independent countries.

    He said that the recent violent incidents in India were a planned action by reactionary forces and certain foreign countries to divert the people from the path of socialism. When India is launching a huge offensive against poverty, vested interest groups are trying their best to divert the people's attention from the fundamental issue of eliminating social and economic inequality. These elements use violence, and if they succeed, the country will split. He said: The way to resolve the differences between people is to consult each other.

    尼赫鲁指责某些外国在印度和亚洲制造混乱
    新华社新德里15日电　印度总理尼赫鲁六月十四日在一次演说中号召印度人民警惕某些外国利用分裂力量来削弱印度和亚洲。
    他在旁遮普省罗塔克举行的群众大会上说，他知道有些煽动混乱和冲突的报纸，特别是德里和旁遮普的一些报纸，是得到一些外国的财政津贴的。他说：“某些外国希望看到我们国家里的冲突和纠纷扩大，因为它们不同意我们的某些政策。”
    尼赫鲁还谈到锡兰某些报纸所登载的消息，这些消息说最近在锡兰发生的有关语言问题的骚动是外国策动的。他说，某些外国不喜欢看到亚洲国家强盛起来，它们花钱在这些新取得独立的国家里散布混乱。
    他说，最近在印度爆发的暴力事件是反动势力和某些外国为使人民离开社会主义道路而进行的有计划的行动。当印度正在对贫穷发动巨大的进攻的时候，既得利益集团竭力想把人民的注意力从消除社会和经济的不平等这个基本问题上转移开去。这些分子使用暴力，如果获得成功，这个国家就会分裂。他说：解决人民之间存在的分歧的办法就是互相商量。
