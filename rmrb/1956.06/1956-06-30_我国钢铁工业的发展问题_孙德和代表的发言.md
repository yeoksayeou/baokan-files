    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li's report to the Congress and am willing to contribute to socialist construction. As a worker in ferrous metallurgy, I would like to offer some personal views on the development of China's iron and steel industry and the general issue of scientific and technological personnel marching towards science, as suggestions for reference.
    With the development of national socialist construction, although the iron and steel industry workers have made great and tenacious efforts, the steel output in 1956 will increase by 58% compared to 1955, and the steel production will reach 4.51 million tons, exceeding the Five-Year Plan target by about 10%. Undoubtedly, this is an amazing achievement and is worthy of gratitude. However, such rapid development still cannot meet the needs of construction, resulting in a tight supply of steel and certain quality problems. To accelerate the resolution of these problems, I propose the following points for discussion:
    (1) While constructing giant iron and steel complexes, consider the construction of medium-sized iron and steel complexes.
    In order to provide a reliable heavy industrial foundation for socialist construction, China must build a number of giant iron and steel bases in the coming years to become the solid foundation of socialist industrialization. This is in line with the laws of industrial development in various countries and the requirements of China's national economic development. At present, China is working hard towards this goal, which is absolutely correct.
    In carrying out such a huge task, due to the weakness of China's past scientific and industrial foundation, there are considerable difficulties that need to be overcome. The most critical difficulty is obtaining a large number of complex and highly modern heavy metallurgical equipment. A complete iron and steel complex with a production capacity of 1.5 million tons requires more than 100,000 tons of equipment for the steel plant itself, as well as related mines, thermal power stations (with a power generation capacity equivalent to half of Shanghai's), transportation loading and unloading equipment, etc., which also amount to a considerable quantity. Most of the major and complex equipment has to rely on foreign supply, especially the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. Support from new democratic brother countries is also needed. The second problem is that the exploration and research of many raw material resources require a considerable amount of time, which is far behind the design requirements in this regard. In addition, the determination of products, the selection of plans, regional planning, the selection and determination of factory sites, urban planning, the massive data investigation and design work, and the gathering and organization of construction forces and materials all require a considerable amount of time. Generally speaking, it takes about one and a half Five-Year Plans. In today's construction boom, this is truly a time that makes people "long for it."
    The huge work that China is currently undertaking is extremely lacking in experience. Thousands of engineers and technicians are participating in this great construction work in different positions. This work is also new to them. The technology and organization methods designed by capitalist countries are hidden in the vaults of a few monopolists, unlike their surplus consumer goods that they like to export. Therefore, their design technology could not be learned before. In addition, the essence of their design ideas is fundamentally different from socialist design ideas. We cannot uncritically adopt their set of knowledge or follow their practices. Only with the selfless and brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union, and the sincere guidance of Soviet experts in China, have they continuously imparted the "science of design" developed in socialist construction to China's younger generation in recent years, enabling them to take on the tasks they should undertake in China's socialist construction. Under the care, education, and cultivation of the Party and the government in recent years, and with the tireless efforts of the staff, a considerable force has grown. There has been a significant improvement in political thought and technical level. After the hardships and tests of work and practice, they are now able to undertake general design tasks (of course, there are many shortcomings and many mistakes have been made); and they have made a vow to intensify their studies with Soviet experts in the coming year or so, and undertake the general design tasks of iron and steel complexes with a production capacity of more than 1.5 million tons under the supervision and encouragement of the people of the whole country. Such an arduous task is undertaken by all designers wholeheartedly, enthusiastically, bravely, and willingly.
    However, it must be pointed out that the key problem in iron and steel industry construction today remains the manufacturing and supply of heavy metallurgical equipment. Without equipment, construction is unimaginable, design cannot be carried out, decisions are difficult to make, and design cannot be unfolded. There are many examples that can illustrate this problem, which will not be discussed in detail here. Obviously, the state's Five-Year Plan and long-term plan have emphasized the establishment of heavy machinery factories to solve the problem of self-supply. This has long been seen. This is absolutely correct. However, there is a time factor here that must be emphasized. Because design work must be ahead of construction, the main equipment must be clearly defined when preparing the design task book and preliminary design for the factories to be built in a few years. To overcome this contradiction in time, it is necessary to accelerate the construction of heavy machinery factories or to cooperate closely, to understand in advance the planning and models of the products of heavy machinery factories in the future, so as to determine the economic scale of iron and steel enterprises and solve a series of other problems.
    In addition, striving for foreign supply as much as possible is naturally the direction of our efforts throughout the country. However, it can only be within the possible range of others. Everyone is busy with communist and socialist construction, and their support for us must also be limited.
    In order to further and faster accelerate the production of steel in our country, to solve the current and future contradiction that the supply of steel cannot keep up with the needs, is there any other way out to overcome these situations? Naturally, this is not a simple question, but it is not necessarily impossible. In addition to accelerating the above measures, while ensuring the established tasks, it may be possible to separate a certain amount of force to simultaneously carry out a relatively large number of medium-sized iron and steel complexes that are slightly smaller in scale than giant iron and steel complexes in the early stage of construction in our country. These enterprises will make as much use as possible of typical designs, make as much use as possible of equipment that can be produced by China's machinery industry and that can be solved with effort, and organize China's machinery industry extensively and better to supply equipment. The foundation of these iron and steel enterprises will be based on domestic supply to win time and exchange for more steel.
    The medium-sized iron and steel complexes referred to here refer to medium-sized integrated iron and steel enterprises with an annual output of about 700,000 tons. According to several years of work experience, the equipment of such iron and steel complexes can be produced and manufactured domestically (except for extremely few equipment or parts that need to be ordered individually from abroad). In terms of design, the domestic can also undertake it, and most of it uses repeated design and typical design (according to different regional conditions and needs, individual workshops can make different modifications and adjustments, or use different typical designs). This can save design time and effort, and make the vast majority of a factory's design simultaneously reused in the construction of many factories. It also creates conditions for simplifying equipment manufacturing, so that mechanical manufacturing plants can use the advantages of mass production, improve the efficiency and speed of equipment manufacturing, and reduce manufacturing costs. If it is proved feasible after detailed research, then several similar iron and steel enterprises can be built in batches within a few years (about three or four years). I think that China has such a vast territory, and it is not too much to build ten or eight such factories in different regions according to different conditions. If there are 10 factories, then it is close to 7 million tons of production capacity, which is a very large number. The output of two such factories is almost equivalent to an iron and steel plant with a production capacity of 1.5 million tons, and four and a half can be equivalent to a giant iron and steel complex with an annual output of 3 million tons. These factories are suitable for using local natural resources with smaller reserves, close to users, can reduce the country's long-distance transportation burden, and can carry out product variety and pattern division with large factories, or can have cooperation, which can be complementary rather than contradictory. Our country needs large iron and steel complexes, and it is also necessary to have such medium-sized complexes according to different resource conditions and regional conditions. Other countries also have these situations.
    While considering these factories, we can still take care of the conditions and possibilities for future development, and retain the possibility of further expansion and reconstruction into larger complexes after a certain number of years, according to the development of the situation, or transform them into special steel plants in the future according to the development of local water resources. As long as it is fully considered in the design, it is also possible.
    Because these types of factories are smaller in scale, the difficulties in equipment supply may be less, the resource investigation and research is simpler, the site selection is also easier, and at the same time, a large number of typical and reused designs are used, the progress can be accelerated, which can accelerate socialist construction and strengthen national defense forces, because these enterprises have reached a considerable scale and have their own economic rationality. In terms of technology, the latest technological achievements can still be adopted: for example, the widespread use of top-blown converter smelting technology, the use of continuous automatic ingot casting technology, to save the input equipment, reduce construction funds, and accelerate the construction speed. The entire production process can also be mechanized and automated as much as possible. In terms of the quality of steel, there is no inferiority to the products of giant iron and steel complexes. In addition, due to the use of oxygen-blown air refining, nitrogen and surplus coke oven gas can also be used for chemical fertilizers or other synthetic products. If the ore source has a high phosphorus content, phosphate fertilizer can also be produced as a byproduct for agricultural production increase. Blast furnace slag and coke oven by-products can also be fully utilized in the same way. Technically, it does not bring any shortcomings, and can achieve the requirements of fast, more, good and a certain degree of saving.
    However, it also brings certain differences in indicators in terms of unit investment cost and labor productivity compared with giant iron and steel complexes. It is naturally not as good as the latter in these indicators, because the equipment units it uses are relatively small, but this difference is not very large and is not intolerable. However, in other aspects, it can win time and produce more steel, and the huge political, economic and social effects created by these factors in the process of socialist construction are incalculable. In the process, it will also cultivate and strengthen talents and forces through the actual test of work, and spread the seeds of the iron and steel industry widely across the country to achieve a situation of blooming and fruitful results. These difficult-to-calculate factors must also play a role in the balance of weighing the pros and cons when making choices.
    In terms of construction forces, if construction is carried out simultaneously in several different places, it is a suitable example of arranging individual construction sites in parallel flow operation in turn. Because what is done is complex construction and installation work, which is similar and similar, it can increase the proficiency of construction and improve the quality level of construction.
    Naturally, major issues like this are a matter of the overall direction and direction of basic construction, and it is a matter that can only be decided in conjunction with national policy. It is not a matter that can be solved in a short period of time by getting a fever in the head. It needs to undergo calm, detailed, repeated investigation and research, calculation and comparison, and a balance of the strengths, weaknesses, benefits, and harms of all aspects of the country before a correct conclusion can be made. It needs to be objectively considered by all parties, and it needs to be carried out with extremely detailed and in-depth technical and economic work, and it needs to be discussed to provide the country with reference and consideration.
    (2) How to solve the problem of equipment design and collaboration
    Solving the creation of equipment supply new products must first rely on international support, and secondly, rely on the close collaboration of relevant departments and personnel in China. For example, the support and close division of labor and collaboration of testing and research, production, design, and manufacturing, and creation regardless of each other. There should be no localism and indifference here (unfortunately, these situations were still very serious in the past). At present, construction is often affected by certain local equipment problems, not because they cannot be solved but because there is "no way to solve" them. The most complex and difficult equipment in steel plants is rolling mills, and the largest is the blooming mill. In addition to other factors, the blooming mill determines the overall appearance and scale of a factory. To solve these problems, I think our effective saying of "three cobblers, make a Zhuge Liang" for many years after liberation will still prove to be successful. To do these tasks, it is necessary to have the process knowledge of production and use, as well as the theory and experience of design, and also the experience of manufacturing and understanding of domestic manufacturing level capabilities. In addition, there must be guidance and solutions to problems in testing and research. This will be successful. This requires close contact and collaboration. The simplest way is to organize people with these abilities and knowledge together, give them the necessary support conditions, and they may be able to learn from each other's strengths and create labor results. This cannot be done without close collaboration among units. Therefore, China must quickly establish a heavy metallurgical equipment design unit (similar to the Soviet ЦНЦЦТМАШ) to meet the design and construction requirements of steel plants. In addition, it can also be required that this same institution complete urgent tasks and quickly produce continuous casting equipment, revolutionize casting technology, and use less or no blooming equipment. In large enterprises, it can save about 8,000 tons of equipment, and in medium-sized factories, it can also save nearly 4,000 tons of equipment. Moreover, the product quality is good, the yield is high, and the cost is low. Using such equipment can increase the average product by 12%. The Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan will reach an annual output of 23 million tons of continuous casting, and the same labor can create nearly 2.8 million tons of finished products more. I think the method of "getting a Zhuge Liang together" will inevitably play its glorious achievements.
    (3) Issues related to improving and improving steel quality
    In recent years, the leadership and staff of the iron and steel industry have made great efforts, and the quality and output have been improved, and the variety has also increased a lot. Many special steel types and alloy steel types that were previously not made have been produced with the help of Soviet experts and achieved achievements. This is worth celebrating. However, the production of certain special steel types, such as certain alloy structural steel, tool steel, high-speed steel, and stainless steel, is inherently very difficult, and in addition, the equipment of many of our special steel plants is still relatively old and cannot meet the requirements of the process. However, construction tasks cannot wait, especially the steel types required for machinery manufacturing must be met in quantity and quality. We must make further efforts. In addition to strictly following operating procedures, enriching equipment, and accelerating the construction of new and expanded factories, we must also try new technologies. For example, the vacuum treatment casting method recently used abroad is relatively simple and easy to achieve a significant improvement in quality, which also requires the close cooperation mentioned in the previous item to achieve a solution to the problem in a relatively short period of time.
    (4) On the issue of general technical personnel marching towards science
    Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao called for marching towards science and catching up with the world's advanced scientific level within twelve years, and Premier Zhou made a report on intellectuals, coupled with the drive of the advanced producers' congress, a upsurge has been set off among the vast majority of engineers and technicians. They are as happy as flowers in their hearts, and everyone, regardless of age, is rushing to learn. They are studying and discussing how to improve learning effectiveness and how to realize the ideal of contributing our strength. In our design institute, the production tasks are tight and urgent, and it is not easy to complete the tasks. In the past month or so, overtime work has not been allowed in order to protect everyone's health, which is correct. However, when it is seen that there are problems with completing the tasks, the masses also have tricks, so they secretly work overtime, but they are afraid of being criticized if they are checked, so in the evening they are nominally learning, but in fact they are working overtime. When people come to check, they are studying, and when people do not come to check, they are actually working overtime. In addition to completing the tasks, they also study and consolidate Russian before going to work in the morning. Most evenings and Sundays are spent studying, and there is a real trend of forgetting to eat and sleep. The enthusiasm and initiative of the masses is gratifying and appreciable, which is naturally a heartfelt response to the motherland's socialist construction and the high tide of the motherland's scientific culture, "everything is self-evident."
    However, there are also many problems that need to be helped and solved.
    (1) The direction of efforts must be clear and guidance must be obtained. In addition to cultivating the design ability of giant iron and steel complexes under the overall goal, what specialized learning work should be done and which special directions should be strived for are all hoped to be gradually clarified under the requirements of the national overall plan, so as to avoid unintentionally taking the same path and creating a counterproductive blind phenomenon when manpower is so tight.
    (2) The issue of the possibility of carrying out scientific research in the work position using spare time. How to guide the enthusiasm of the masses to carry out scientific or technical economic and engineering technical research. For example, how to combine their efforts with the problems that need to be solved in national construction, and undertake certain tasks under the close contact and division of labor and collaboration of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, research institutes, universities, and production units. I think there are still many things that can be done in this regard. For example, the selection and determination of new processes, the economic comparison and scope of use of smelting procedures, the issue of saving equipment investment, the issue of saving building materials and design calculation methods, and there are also many problems that need to be solved and researched within the design institute, which cannot be discussed one by one. In short, the issue of improving and developing the vast younger generation must be guided in a planned manner. Research work cannot and should not be limited to the laboratory. Because there are many other issues that must help and guide the younger generation to learn the methods of research work and serve the further development of the country.
    (3) It is necessary to solve the convenience of obtaining magazines and documents. To solve some problems, it is necessary to use a lot of literature materials in magazines (the record of the labor achievements of scientists in the past). Often, to research and solve a specialized problem, it is necessary to refer to dozens of domestic and foreign literatures. Therefore, it is required to organize, sort out, and disseminate books and literature in a planned and planned manner. The preliminary opinion should be that the National Library of Beijing and the Academy of Sciences or other relevant institutions should cooperate to produce a complete set of technical magazine catalogs. The domestic ones should be sorted out and disseminated. The ones that are not yet available must be completed within one or two years. China is so big that it should save at least one set of the world's complete literature, which is a treasure trove of knowledge of scientific development around the world for many years.
    The libraries and rooms of magazines and technical literature preserved by various agencies throughout the country should be organized into a pipe network. The purpose of calling it a pipe network is to make it play a role in circulation and exchange, rather than letting the literature sleep.
    In addition, it is also necessary to make it convenient for users to obtain photographic copies of individual papers or paragraphs in magazines or books. Take a not too high cost fee. It is necessary to be able to get it in a short time with a letter and a stamp. This can save scientific personnel's time and energy for research and writing. Make all the forces that can be exerted used in the creative efforts of our country's politics, economy, science, technology, culture, and art to meet the upsurge.
    This is also to make "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" have the fertilization and irrigation before blooming, so that all schools can contend, contend more, contend well, and all the flowers are flowers and brocades.
    The above are personal immature and very local views, which are naturally not comprehensive and may be very incorrect. They are put forward for the consideration and correction of the representatives. If these views can be proved to be correct, they will play a certain role in promoting the development of our country's national economy and marching towards science. Driven by this, I dare to put forward these issues for discussion. Facing the great, glorious, infinitely brilliant and bright future of the motherland, we have infinite confidence and guarantee to study humbly and tirelessly, work diligently, and work with the people of the whole country under the training and education of the Party, strengthen ideological transformation, improve political level, learn advanced technology, especially Soviet technology, and dedicate our boiling inner enthusiasm, our youth and all our strength to the great motherland, the Party and Chairman Mao.

    我国钢铁工业的发展问题 
    ——孙德和代表的发言
    我完全拥护李副总理在大会所作的报告，并愿为社会主义建设贡献力量。作为黑色冶金工作者，我想就我国钢铁工业的发展问题与一般科技人员向科学进军的问题，提出一些个人的看法，作为参考的意见。
    随着国家社会主义建设的发展，虽然钢铁业的职工已经作了极大的与顽强的努力，在1956年度内比1955年的钢产量将增加58％，钢生产量将达到451万吨，超过五年计划的指标约10％。无疑的这是惊人的成绩，这是值得感谢的。但是这样高速的发展仍然不能满足建设的需要，以致呈现钢材供应的紧张状况，也存在着一定的质量问题。针对这些问题的加速解决，提出下面几点商榷的意见。
    （一）巨型钢铁联合企业的建设中同时考虑建设中型钢铁联合企业的问题
    为着提供社会主义建设可靠的重工业基础，我国在今后若干年内须建成不少个巨型钢铁基地成为社会主义工业化的坚固的基础，这是符合于各国工业发展的规律的，是符合于我国国民经济发展的要求的。目前我国上下正在为着这个目标努力奋斗，这都是绝对正确的。
    在进行这样巨大的工作里，由于我国过去的科学与工业基础的薄弱是存在着相当的巨大困难需努力克服的。最关键的困难是大量的复杂与高度现代化的重型冶金设备的取得问题。一个完整的150万吨产量钢铁联合企业钢铁厂本身便需要十多万吨的设备，另外还有相关的矿山，热电站（发电能力相当于上海的一半），交通运输起卸的设备等等，数量也不少。重大的复杂的设备大部分要依靠国外供应，特别是苏联的无私的帮助。也须依靠新民主兄弟国家的支援。其次的问题是许多原料资源的勘探与调查研究须要相当长久的时间，在这方面也是远远落后于设计要求的。另外产品的确定，方案的抉择，区域的规划，厂址的选择与确定，城市的规划，庞大的资料调查与设计工作，以及施工力量与物资的集结组织都需要相当长久的时间。一般的说大致需要一个半五年计划的时间，在今日建设高潮情况之下，这真是一个使人“望穿秋水”的时间。
    我国现在进行的这一巨大的工作，都是极端缺少经验的。成千上万工程技术人员在不同的岗位上参加了这一伟大的建设工作。这一工作对他们讲也是新的。资本主义国家设计的技术与组织方法是藏在某些少数垄断资本家的保险柜里的，不像他们过剩的消耗商品，他们喜欢出口的。因此他们的设计技术在以前是学不到的。另外他们的设计思想本质又与社会主义设计思想有原则上的不同。我们不能不加批判的取法于他们的一套知识，不能因袭他们的作法。只有在苏联无私的兄弟般的援助之下，苏联在华专家的真诚指导之下，几年来不断的将社会主义建设中发展出来的“设计科学”传授给我国的青年一代，使得他们有能力来承担我国社会主义建设中应该承担的任务。几年来在党与政府关怀教育培养，与工作人员日日夜夜的辛勤努力学习之下，已经生长出一支相当不小的力量。在政治思想与技术水平上都有了显著的提高。经过工作与实践的辛酸折磨与考验，已经能承担一般的设计任务（当然有很多缺点，也有过很多的错误）；并且立下志愿将要在一年多的时间之内加紧向苏联专家学习，在全国人民的监督鞭策之下承担150万吨以上钢铁联合企业总的设计任务。这样艰巨的任务是全体设计人员衷心、热情、勇于与乐于承当的。
    但是必须指出，今天钢铁工业建设突出的关键问题仍然是重型冶金设备的制造与供应问题。没有设备，建设是不可想像的，设计也无法进行，难于作出决定，设计也无法展开。有很多的实例可以说明这个问题，这里不详谈了。很显然，国家五年计划与长远计划里都重视了重型机厂的建立来解决自己供应的问题。早已看到了这个问题。这都是绝对正确的。然而这里有个时间的因素，必须强调指出。因为设计工作须走在建设的前面，几年以后要建设的厂必须在作设计任务书与初步设计时候便能明确主要的设备。克服这个时间上的矛盾，只有要求加速重型机厂建设的进度或是密切的协作，事先了解重型机厂今后产品的规划与型号，从而确定钢铁企业经济的规模与其他一系列问题的解决。
    此外尽量争取国外供应，自然是我国上下努力的方向。然而也只能是在别人的可能范围之内。大家都忙于共产主义与社会主义建设，对我们的支援也必然是有限度的。
    为了更多与更快的加速我国钢的产量，来解除目前以及今后一个时期钢铁供应赶不上需要的矛盾情况，有没有其他的出路来克服这些情况呢？自然这不是简单的问题，但仍然不一定是不可能的。除去加速上面的各项措施之外，在保证已定任务的同时，另外分出一定的力量，在我国建设的初期同时进行数目较多的，比巨型钢铁联合企业规模稍微小一些的中型钢铁联合企业也许是可能的。这些企业将尽多的利用典型设计，尽多的使用我国机械工业可能生产与费一把力气能解决的设备，广泛的更好的组织我国的机械工业来供应设备。将这些钢铁企业的基础放在国内供应的基础上，来赢取时间，换取更多的钢材。
    这里所指的中型钢铁联合企业是指的年产约70万吨左右的中型联合钢铁企业。根据几年来的工作经验，这类钢铁联合企业的设备是有可能在国内生产与制造的（除去极端少数的设备或零件需个别向国外订货）。在设计方面国内也是可以承担的，绝大部分利用重复设计与典型设计（根据地区不同情况与需要，个别车间可作不同的修改与调整，或使用不同的典型设计）。这样可以节约设计的时间与力量，使一个厂的设计的绝大部分在好多厂的建设中同时重复利用。也创造了设备制造简化的条件，可以使用机械制造厂成批生产的优点，提高设备制造的效率与速度，减低制造成本。如果经过详细研究之后证明这是可行的，则在几年之内（大约三、四年）可以成批的多建设好多个类似的钢铁企业。我想中国幅员这样大，分批在不同地区根据不同条件建上十个八个这样的厂是不算多的。假如是10个厂，那么就是接近700万吨的生产能力，这是一个很大的数目。两个这样的厂的产量差不多抵得上一个150万吨的钢铁厂，四个半就可以抵一个300万吨年产量的巨型钢铁联合企业。这些厂适宜于利用当地天然储藏量较小的资源，接近于使用用户，可以减少国家长距离的运输负担，对于大厂来讲可以进行生产品种与花色的分工，也可以有协作，可以是相辅的而不是矛盾的。我国对大的钢铁联合企业是需要的，对这样中型的联合企业根据资源情况与地区情况不同，想来也是需要的。在其他国家里也有这些情况。
    在考虑这些厂的同时仍然可以照顾将来发展的条件与可能保留在一定年限之后，根据形势的发展进一步扩建与改建为更大的联合企业，或者是根据当地水利资源发展的可能将来转变为特殊钢厂。只要在设计时予以充分的考虑，也都是可能的。
    因为这类厂的规模较小，设备供应上困难可能少一些，在资源调查研究方面简单一些，厂址选择也比较容易，同时大量使用典型及复用设计，进度上便易于加快，可以加速社会主义建设，可以加强国防的力量，因为这类企业已经达到了相当可观的规模，有着本身的经济合理性。在工艺上仍然可以采用最新的技术成就：例如普遍使用顶吹转炉的冶炼工艺，采用连续自动铸锭的工艺，以节约投入的设备，减少建设资金加速建设速度。整个的生产过程也是可以尽量使用机械化与自动化的。在钢材的质量上与巨型的钢铁联合企业的产品没有逊色的。此外由于采用吹氧风炼还可以利用氮气与节余焦炉煤气供化工肥料或其他合成产品的利用。如果矿源的含磷高也可附产磷肥供农业增产之用。高炉渣以及焦炉附产也同样的可以充分利用。在技术上不带来甚么缺点，可以作到快、多、好与一定程度的省的要求。
    但是它也带来在单位投资费用上与劳动生产率上，与巨型钢铁联合企业相比，有一定的指标上的差异，它在这些指标上自然是赶不上后者的，因为它所使用的设备单位比较小，但是这个差别并不很大也不是不可容忍的。但是在另外方面是可以赢得时间与多生产的钢材，这些因素在社会主义建设过程中所创造的巨大的政治、经济与社会效果，是无法估算的。在过程中也会由于工作的实际考验，培养壮大人材与力量，在全国遍地撒下钢铁工业广泛的种子取得遍地开花结果的局面。这些难于计算的因素自然也要在权衡利弊抉择的平衡杆里一同发生它的作用。
    在施工力量方面，假如同时在几个不同地方进行建设，则正好是安排个别工地依次平行流水作业的适当例子。因为作的是复杂的建筑与安装工作，是相近与类似的，可以增加施工的熟练与提高施工的质量水平。
    自然像这类重大的问题是基本建设总的方针方向的问题，是结合国策才能决定的问题，不是头脑发热在短期内可以解决的问题，须要经过冷静、详细、反复的调查研究，计算比较，以及全国各方面力量与利弊的平衡之后，才能作出正确的结论。须要由各方面加以客观的考虑，并须作极细致的深入的技术与经济工作，并进行商榷，提供国家的参考与考虑。
    （二）如何解决设备设计的问题与协作
    解决设备供应新产品的创造首先须依靠国际的支援，另外须依靠国内有关部门与人员的密切协作。例如试验研究、生产、设计、制造各方面的支援与密切分工协作，不分彼此的进行创造。这里不应该有本位与互不关心的情况（很可惜这些情况过去还是很严重的）。目前还常常因为某些局部设备问题，不是不能解决而是“无门解决”，以致有些建设受到了影响。钢铁厂最复杂与困难的设备是轧钢机，最大的是初轧机。除去别的因素以外，初轧机决定一个厂的全貌与规模。解决这些问题我想我们解放以后多年来的行之有效的口语“三个臭皮匠，凑个诸葛亮”仍然还会证明是成功的。作这些工作，须要有生产、使用的工艺知识，也须有设计的理论与经验，还要有制造的经验与了解国内制造的水平能力。另外还必须有试验研究的指导与解决问题。这样才会成功。这就必须密切的联系与协作，最简单的办法是把有这些能力与知识的人组织在一起，予以必要的支持条件，他们便有可能取长补短会创造出劳动成果。这是没有各单位密切协作所办不到的。因此我国须很快的建立重型冶金设备设计单位（有如苏联ЦНЦЦТМАШ的类似机构），来满足钢铁厂设计建设的要求。另外也还可以要求这个同样的机构完成紧急的任务，赶快搞出连续铸锭的设备，在铸造技术上革命，少用或不用初轧设备。在大型企业可以节省约8，000吨的设备，在中型厂也可节省将近4，000吨的设备。而且产品质量好，成品率高，成本也低。使用这样设备可以平均增加产品12％。苏联第六个五年计划将要达到年产2，300万吨的连续铸锭，同样的劳动可以多创造接近280万吨的成品。我想凑个诸葛亮的办法必然会发挥它的光辉成就的。
    （三）钢材质量提高改善的问题
    几年来钢铁业的领导与职工尽了很大的努力，质量产量有了提高，品种也有很多的增加。许多特殊钢种，合金钢种以往不会作的在苏联专家帮助之下生产出来了，取得了成就。这是值得庆贺的。但是某些特殊钢种，例如某些合金结构钢、工具钢、高速钢、不锈钢，它的生产本身就是很不容易的，加以我们许多特殊钢厂的设备，还是比较陈旧的配备，不能满足工艺的要求。但是建设任务不能等待，特别是机械制造所要的钢种必须在数量与质量上予以满足。我们还须更进一步的努力，除去严格操作规程，充实设备，加速新建与扩建的厂以外，还必须试用新的技术。例如最近在国外已经使用的真空处理浇铸方法，是比较简单与容易取得显著提高质量的效果的，这也需要前项内所说的密切合作取得在较短期内解决的问题。
    （四）关于一般技术人员向科学进军的问题
    自从党中央与毛主席号召向科学进军，要在十二年内赶上世界的科学先进水平，周总理作了关于知识分子的报告以来，又加先进生产者大会的带动，已经在绝大部分工程技术人员中掀起一个热潮。心里像开了花一样的喜欢，真是不分老少的人人争先恐后的进行学习。研究讨论怎样提高学习效果，怎样实现贡献我们的力量的理想。在我们设计院里生产任务是紧张的、是急的，完成任务很不容易。最近一个多月以来又不许加班加点，为了使大家的健康，这是正确的。但是在眼看完成任务有问题的时候，群众也有窍门，于是偷偷摸摸的加班加点，但是又怕检查出来受批评，于是在晚间有时名为学习实际是加班。人来检查便在学习，不来检查实际加班，除去完成任务之外，早晨上班之前还学习与巩固俄文。大部分晚上及星期天都学习，真有废寝忘餐的趋势。群众的这种热情与积极性是可喜与可感的，这自然是对祖国社会主义建设与祖国科学文化高潮内心的“尽在不言中”的响应。
    但是也有许多问题须要取得帮助与解决的。
    （1）努力的方向必须明确并取得指导。在总的目标之下能锻炼巨型钢铁联合企业的设计能力之外，还要作那些专门的学习工作，向那些特殊的专门方向努力，都希望在国家总的计划要求之下逐渐明确起来，免于都不谋而合的走一条路，在人力这样紧张的时候，不要造成事倍功半的盲目现象。
    （2）在工作岗位上利用业余时间进行科学研究的可能性的问题。如何引导群众的积极性进行科学或技术经济以及工程技术上的研究工作问题。例如现在如何将他们的努力结合国家建设需要解决的问题结合起来，在科学院、研究所、高等学校、生产单位的密切联系与分工协作之下，承担一定的任务。我想在这方面仍然是有很多事情是可以作的。例如新工艺的选择与确定的问题，冶炼程序的经济比较与使用范围的问题，设备投资的节约问题，建筑材料节约与设计计算方法问题，还有不少设计院内部需要解决与研究的问题，不能一一的谈这些问题。总之广大青年一代的提高与力量发挥的问题，必须有规划的得到引导。研究的工作不可能也不应该只限于试验室之内。因为还有很多这以外的问题，必须帮助与引导青年一代学会研究工作的方法，为国家进一步的发展而服务。
   （3）必须解决杂志、文献取得的方便。要解决一些问题，需要使用很多的杂志上的文献材料（以前科学家劳动成果的记录）。常常研究解决一个专门问题须要参考几十篇的国内外文献。因此要求有计划有规划的进行图书与文献的组织、整理、传播的工作。初步意见应该由北京图书馆与科学院或有关的其他机构，合作搞出成套的技术杂志的目录。国内有的整理成套，进行传播。还没有的须在一、二年之内补全。中国之大应该保存最少一套全世界齐全的文献，这是多少年来全世界科学发展知识的宝库。
    应该将全国各机关保存的杂志及技术文献的图书馆、室组织成一个管网。叫管网的目的是要它起流通、交流的作用，而不是文献睡觉。
    另外还须作到使用人的便于取得杂志或书籍上个别论文或段落的照像抄件。取不太高的成本费。要作到一封信贴上邮票，便可以短期内得到。这样可以节省科学人员研究、写作的时间与精力。使一切能够发挥的力量都用在我国政治、经济、科学、技术、文化、艺术的创造努力上，来迎接高潮。
    这也就是使“百花齐放，百家争鸣”具备开花以前的施肥灌溉，使各家都能鸣，鸣得多，鸣得好，所有的花都是花团锦簇。
    以上是个人的不成熟、很局部的看法，自然是不够全面，也许可能是很不正确的看法，提出来供各位代表的考虑与指正。假如能证实这些看法是正确的话，将会对我国国民经济的发展与向科学进军起一定的推动作用。受了这样的驱使，因此敢于将这些问题提出来讨论。面对着祖国伟大光荣无限灿烂光明的前途，我们具有无限的信心，保证虚心、孜孜不倦的学习，勤勤恳恳的努力，与全国人民一起在党的培养教育之下，加强思想改造，提高政治水平，学习先进技术，特别是苏联的技术，将我们内心沸腾的热情，将我们的青春与全部力量献与伟大的祖国、党与毛主席。
