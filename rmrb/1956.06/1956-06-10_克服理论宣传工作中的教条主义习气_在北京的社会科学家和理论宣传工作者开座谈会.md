Xinhua News Agency report: More than thirty social scientists and theoretical propaganda workers in Beijing gathered on the 7th to discuss how to overcome dogmatic tendencies in theoretical propaganda work.

This symposium was convened by the editorial department of "Study" magazine.

Historians Fan Wenlan and Hou Wailu, economists Di Chaobai and Gong Shiqi, and Shi Zhe, Director of the Compilation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as personnel engaged in teaching and editing work, analyzed the causes of dogmatic tendencies in their speeches. They believed that the main reasons were insufficient understanding of Marxism-Leninism, theory being divorced from practice, and blind worship of "authorities." They also criticized the error of neglecting in-depth study of Marxist-Leninist theory while opposing dogmatism.

When discussing how to overcome dogmatic tendencies in theoretical research, theoretical propaganda, and teaching, some advocated providing theoretical researchers with more practical materials, otherwise overcoming dogmatism would still be very difficult; some advocated promoting a down-to-earth style of academic research; some believed that newspaper and magazine review work should be improved and strengthened, and criticisms of dogmatism should be carried out regularly; others requested that scientific translation series publish fewer general articles and introduce more new foreign academic issues and practical situations; some also suggested holding symposiums for scholars with different opinions on certain academic issues to展开争论, promote independent thinking and creativity in theoretical research and theoretical propaganda work.

    克服理论宣传工作中的教条主义习气
    在北京的社会科学家和理论宣传工作者开座谈会
    据新华社讯　在北京的三十多位社会科学家和理论宣传工作者，七日集会座谈怎样克服理论宣传工作中教条主义习气的问题。
    这个座谈会是由“学习”杂志编辑部召集的。
    历史学家范文澜、侯外庐，经济学家狄超白、龚士其和中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局局长师哲，以及从事教学工作、编辑工作的人员等人，在发言中分析了教条主义习气产生的原因。他们认为主要是由于马克思列宁主义水平不高，理论脱离实际，盲目崇拜“权威”。他们同时也批判在反对教条主义时，忽视深入研究马克思列宁主义理论的错误。
    当探讨在理论研究工作、理论宣传工作和教学工作中怎样克服教条主义习气的问题时，有的主张多供给理论研究工作者各种实际资料，否则克服教条主义仍会感到很大困难；有的主张提倡老老实实研究学术的风气；有的认为应该改进和加强报刊评介工作，经常开展对教条主义的批判；也有人要求各种科学的译丛少登较空泛的文章，多介绍些外国新的学术问题和实际情况；还有人建议目前对某些学术问题抱有不同见解的学者举行座谈，展开争论，促使理论研究工作和理论宣传工作发挥独立思考的能力和创造精神。
