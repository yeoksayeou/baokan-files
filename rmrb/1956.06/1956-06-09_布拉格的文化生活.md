    Cultural Life in Prague
    Czechoslovakia, Yi Pulaheiteka
    Anyone who has been to Prague will say that the most beautiful time of year in Prague is spring. Every Prague resident can attest to this. On spring evenings, the streets of Prague are always crowded with people. Hundreds and thousands of pedestrians stroll along the banks of the Vltava River, admiring and praising the scenery of their ancient and vibrant city.
    However, the pedestrians on Prague's streets in spring are not just admirers of urban landscapes and natural scenery. In the evenings, many residents of the capital hurry to the theater to see a play or enjoy music, or to stroll through the leafy gardens of the old aristocracy, which, according to the will of the people, have now opened their heavily guarded gates and become treasure troves of art.
    Prague has its own unique style. When the art season in many European cities is coming to an end with the arrival of spring, Prague's art season reaches its peak.
    Since freedom came to Prague, the "Prague Spring" International Music Festival has been held here annually. This year's "Prague Spring" began on May 12 and lasted until June 3. In addition to performances of various small operas, symphony orchestras and chamber orchestras, as well as dozens of soloists and choirs, performed in Letná Park, Belvedere Palace, Wallenstein Palace, the sculpture gallery of Zbraslav Castle, the gallery of Šternberk Palace, in various theaters, and in the auditorium of Prague University.
    When the whole world commemorated the bicentennial of the birth of the great musical genius Mozart this year, Prague was already bathed in the bright spring. Famous musicians, music critics, and journalists from all over the world came here to participate in the "Prague Spring" Music Festival. Members of the Soviet delegation included conductor Rachlin, violinist Oistrakh, and pianist Lichzel. Pianists from various countries included Fischer from Hungary, Kempff from the Federal Republic of Germany, and Katchen from the United States. We welcomed the Hungarian Symphony Orchestra, the Beethoven String Quartet from Moscow, and the Zagreb Orchestra from Yugoslavia to Prague. To promote cultural exchange, the Berliner Ensemble came to Prague, and the opera troupe of the Prague National Theater went to the German Democratic Republic for a visiting performance.
    When the Prague Opera troupe performed the Czech folk opera "Dalibor" by Smetana, "Rusalka" by Dvořák, and the modern-themed opera "The Whirlpool" by the Slovak composer Suchoň in Berlin, artists from the German Democratic Republic performed Weber's "Der Freischütz" and Strauss's "Die schweigsame Frau" at the Smetana Theater in Prague. The people of the two friendly countries welcomed these performances with such enthusiasm.
    The artists from People's China achieved amazing and remarkable success at the "Prague Spring" Music Festival. Their main performance was held on May 18 at Prague's largest Smetana Theater. The hall was packed, even the fifth floor was full, and everyone listened attentively to the orchestra playing composer He Luting's "Evening Party" and Ma Sicong's "Nostalgia," as well as Mozart's Concerto for Flute and Orchestra and Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat major. Music critics unanimously praised the young conductor Li Delun, who conducted the symphony orchestra with such confidence and skill. The critics also gave high praise to Li Xuequan's flute solo and the piano skills of the female pianist Wu Leyi.
    The foreign participants in the "Prague Spring," especially the guests from Western countries, were very surprised by Czechoslovakia's "bold activities." They called the "Prague Spring" a "courageous undertaking," and they were surprised that for several weeks in a row, every night, many concert halls with a capacity of several thousand listeners were always filled. You know, Prague has a total of only one million residents, while London, with a population of eight million, does not dare to venture into operating such a huge "enterprise" as the "Prague Spring." We often hear similar opinions. Musicians from Western countries have seen with their own eyes and believe that the people's democratic system is of great significance to the people, to improving the people's cultural level and artistic accomplishment. They cannot but believe in the significance of socialism in developing the entire national culture, and its significance to the development of artists. The people's democratic system gives our country's artists unprecedentedly broad opportunities for activities. The Czechoslovak people have long been known as a nation rich in musical talent. The fact that there are now several symphony orchestras, many national chamber orchestras, and several musical theater groups in Prague alone is difficult for musicians from the West to understand.
    Our people enjoy a high level of cultural life. In Prague, there are twenty permanent theaters, a youth theater, two permanent children's theaters, and an amateur theater. The amateur theaters perform by some of the best amateur troupes from all over the republic. The level of the theater performances is very high, and their repertoire is constantly enriched. In recent months, many new drama titles expressing modern life have appeared on the posters in Prague. The National Theater performed the allegorical poetic drama "The Sun Still Falls on Antrankida Today" by People's Artist Vítězslav Nezval, which is full of calls protesting the imperialist adventurous policy of preparing for atomic war. While performing this play, the theater also staged the drama "Patient No. 113" by the Slovak playwright Peter Karvaš. This play expresses the issue of the transformation of the old intellectuals.
    We can also find similar plots in Jarš's play "Intellectuals." These plays were welcomed and praised by the audience, and Prague's television and radio stations broadcast adaptations of these plays seven times a week. Steglik's comedy "Farmer's Love" has also spread very quickly among many amateur troupes, like a beautiful song. The Neuman Theater in Prague, located in a working-class area on the outskirts of Prague, staged this play. Steglik, the most successful and prestigious Czechoslovak playwright, ridiculed the reactionaries and their delusions of war and restoration in this comedy. This script has its own characteristics, it can make the audience laugh continuously for two hours, make the audience happy for two hours, only at the end, the tragic fact appears: the most glorious character in the play - a young girl is killed by terrorists. This play tells us that the plans of traitors and enemies who oppose our system to restore the "old era" are stupid and ridiculous. But what they do is still dangerous and needs vigilance. Among some new plays, we can also mention Pavliček's play "I Want to Go Back to My Hometown." In this play, the author shows the audience the fate of a young man who was tempted by American propaganda and exiled to Western Europe.
    During this season, the art life in our capital has also become active. The Czechoslovak Military Art Studio and the Soviet Grekov Military Art Studio held a painting exhibition on military themes together. This exhibition aroused enthusiastic comments. The exhibition of V. Novak, the oldest painter in Prague, also opened in the building of the Mánes Art Association. The exhibition featured his most famous, beautiful, and delicate landscapes that gave the audience a pleasant impression. The landscape painting exhibition of the young Czech painter V. Jiroudek is also very interesting. In the recent national exhibition, he showed that he has a unique style in genre painting and large paintings. At the same time, many small painting exhibitions were held, most of which inherited the excellent traditions of Czechoslovak painting art and have a high level. Recently, in plastic arts, just like in all our arts, there has been an increasing effort to create a unique style, strive to avoid uniformity, and strive for authenticity.
    Czechoslovak painters, who have close ties with the past and modern realistic art, are fighting for lofty ideals together with the people. After mastering the new methods of artistic expression, they can embark on the correct path of militant realistic art and encourage the people to fight for great social goals. They will create new and beautiful works worthy of our great era.
    I would like to cite the following few things to end my brief introduction to the cultural life of Prague in May. I think this will help readers in distant places to learn more about the lively cultural life of Czechoslovakia. Prague has almost a hundred cinemas, and there is a huge Julius Fučík Culture Park, which has a rich cultural program every day. Many small theaters, amusement parks, and cultural palaces perform new plays every day or several times a week, which is a characteristic of Prague. There are dozens of amateur troupes here. These troupes perform all year round, and hundreds of amateur troupes from the republic hold performances every year.
    This year, Czechoslovakia's prosperous cultural life will continue from spring to summer. The regular international film festival will be held in Karlovy Vary in July. In many applications, we have already received applications from distant China. Twenty-nine countries participated in the last film festival. This year we will receive more participants.
    The cultural life of Prague is rich and colorful. It symbolizes the prosperity of our motherland and shows the happy life of our people.

    布拉格的文化生活
    捷克斯洛伐克　伊·普拉海特卡
    到过布拉格的人，都会说，布拉格最美的时节是春天。每个布拉格人都能够证明这一点。在春天的傍晚，布拉格的街道上总是挤满了人群。成千成百的行人都在弗尔塔瓦河的岸边漫步，浏览着和赞美着自己的古老而又生气勃勃的城市的景色。
    但是，春天的布拉格大街上的行人并不只限于城市风光和自然景色的欣赏者。一到晚间，首都的许多居民都匆忙地到剧院去看戏或欣赏音乐，到绿荫如盖的旧日贵族的花园里去游玩，这些贵族的花园，现在已经按照人民的意志打开了重重的门禁，成为艺术的宝库了。
    布拉格有它自己的独特的风格。当欧洲许多国家的城市的艺术季节随着春季的到来而近尾声的时候，布拉格的艺术季节却达到了它的高峰。
    自从自由降临到布拉格以来，在这里每年一度举行了“布拉格之春”国际音乐节。今年的“布拉格之春”从五月十二日开始，一直延续到六月三日。除了演出各种小型的歌剧外，交响乐队和室内乐队，以及几十个独唱家和合唱团分别在列捷布尔格公园，在别里维捷尔夏宫，在瓦尔林什坦宫，在兹布拉斯拉夫城堡的雕刻陈列馆，在什切尔别尔格宫的陈列馆，在各剧院，在布拉格大学的礼堂等地演出。
    当今年全世界纪念伟大的音乐天才莫扎特诞生二百周年的时候，布拉格已经是明媚的春天了。著名的音乐家、音乐批评家和世界各国的新闻记者都来到这里参加了“布拉格之春”音乐节。苏联代表团的成员有：乐队指挥拉赫林，提琴家奥伊斯特拉赫，钢琴家利赫切尔。各国的钢琴家中有：匈牙利的菲舍尔，从德意志联邦共和国来的肯夫，从美国来的卡特陈等。我们在布拉格欢迎过匈牙利交响乐队，莫斯科的贝多芬弦乐四重奏和从南斯拉夫来的萨格勒布乐队。为了促进文化交流，柏林的喜剧团来到了布拉格，布拉格国家剧院的歌剧团到德意志民主共和国去作访问演出。
    当布拉格歌剧团在柏林上演捷克的民间歌剧斯麦塔那的“达里鲍尔”，德沃夏克的“水神”和斯洛伐克作曲家苏霍的表现现代题材的歌剧“涡旋”的时候，民主德国的艺术家在布拉格的斯麦塔那剧院上演了威柏的“自由射手”和斯特劳斯的“沉默寡言的女人”。两个友好的国家的人民都是那样热情地欢迎这些演出。
    人民中国的艺术家们在“布拉格之春”音乐会上得到了惊人的和鲜明的成就。他们的主要演出是五月十八日在布拉格最大的斯麦塔那剧院里举行的。大厅里挤满了观众，甚至五层楼上都座无虚席，大家都凝神地听乐队演奏作曲家贺绿汀的“晚会”和马思聪的“思乡曲”，以及莫扎特的协奏曲的长笛独奏，李斯特的降E大调第一号钢琴曲。音乐批评家们一致称赞青年的乐队指挥李德伦，他是那样自信地和熟练地指挥着交响乐队。批评界对李学全的长笛独奏和女钢琴家吴乐懿的弹奏技巧也给予很高的评价。
      “布拉格之春”的外国参加者们，特别是从西方国家来的客人们都很惊奇捷克斯洛伐克的这种“大胆的活动”。他们把“布拉格之春”称为“勇敢的事业”，他们很奇怪：在接连着几个星期的每天晚上，许多个能容纳几千听众的音乐厅总是盛况不衰。要知道布拉格总共只有一百万居民，而有八百万人口的伦敦却不敢冒险经营像“布拉格之春”这样巨大的“企业”。类似这样的意见，我们是常常可以听到的。从西方国家来的音乐家亲眼看到了而且相信了：人民民主制度对于人民，对于提高人民的文化水平和艺术修养有着多么重要的意义。他们不能不相信社会主义在发展整个民族文化上的意义，和它对艺术家的发展的意义。人民民主制度给予我国艺术家们空前未有的广泛的活动机会。捷克斯洛伐克人民很早以前就以富有音乐天才的民族而闻名。仅仅在布拉格一个地方现在就有几个交响乐队，许多个国家室内乐团，几个音乐剧团，这个事实是很使西方来的音乐家们难以理解的。
    我们的人民享受着高度的文化生活。在布拉格有二十个固定的剧院，一个青年剧院，两个固定的儿童剧院，一个业余剧院。在业余剧院演出的都是从共和国各处来的一些最好的业余剧团。剧院的演出水平是很高的，它们的剧目也不断地丰富。最近几个月，在布拉格的宣传画上出现了许多表现现代生活的新戏剧的名字。国家剧院演出了人民艺术家维切兹斯拉夫·涅兹瓦尔的寓言诗剧“太阳今天还落在安特兰基达”，这个剧充满了抗议帝国主义准备原子战争的冒险政策的呼声。在演出这个剧的同时，这个剧院还上演了斯洛伐克剧作家彼得·卡尔瓦什的戏剧“113号病人”。这个剧表现了旧知识分子改造的问题。
    我们在雅尔什的剧本“知识分子”里，也可以找到类似的情节。这些剧都得到观众的欢迎和好评，布拉格的电视电台每星期有七次要播送这些剧的改编本。斯切格里克的喜剧“农民的爱”，也像一首优美的歌子一样，在许多业余剧团中得到了非常迅速的传播。位于布拉格近郊工人区的布拉格的涅依曼剧院上演了这个剧。享有最大成功和声望的捷克斯洛伐克剧作家斯切格里克，在这个喜剧中嘲笑了反动派和他们对战争和复辟的妄想。这个剧本有它自己的特点，它可以使观众连续大笑两个钟头，使观众乐两个钟头，仅仅在结尾的时候，才出现了悲剧的事实：剧中最光辉的角色——一个年轻女孩子被恐怖分子杀害了。这个剧告诉我们：叛徒和反对我们制度的敌人对恢复“旧时代”的计划是愚蠢的和可笑的。但是他们所干的勾当却仍是危险的，需要警惕的。在一些新的剧本中，还可以提一下帕夫里奇克的剧本“我想回到故乡去”。作者在这个剧本中使观众看到受了美国宣传的诱惑而流亡到西欧去的一个青年人的命运。
    在这个季节里，我们首都的美术生活也活跃起来了。捷克斯洛伐克军事美术画室和苏联格列科夫军事画室在一起举行了一个军事题材的绘画展览会。这个展览会引起了热烈的评论。布拉格最老的画家维·诺瓦科的展览会也在曼尼斯美术协会的楼房里开幕了。在展览会中展出了他最著名的、给观众以愉快印象的美丽、细致的风景画。年青的捷克画家弗·伊罗乌德克的风景画展览会也是很有兴趣的，他在最近一次全国展览会上表明自己在风俗画和大幅画上是具有独特风格的。同时还举办了许多小型的绘画展览会，大部分都继承着捷克斯洛伐克绘画艺术的优秀传统，具有很高的水平。最近一个时期，在造型美术中也像在我们所有的艺术一样，越来越多地努力创造独特风格，竭力避免千篇一律和力求真实。
    同过去和现代的现实主义艺术有着密切联系的捷克斯洛伐克画家，同人民在一起为争取崇高的理想而斗争，他们在掌握了艺术的新的表现方法以后，就能够走上战斗的现实主义艺术的正确道路，鼓舞人民为争取伟大的社会目标而斗争。他们将创作出无愧于我们伟大时代的新的、美好的作品。
    我想举出下面几件事来结束我对五月的布拉格文化生活的简短介绍。我想这会帮助远方的读者多了解一些捷克斯洛伐克活跃的文化生活情景。布拉格差不多有一百家电影院，这里有一所巨大的尤利乌斯·伏契克文化公园，每天都有丰富的文化节目。许多小型剧场、游艺场和文化宫每天上演或一周上演几次新剧是布拉格的特点。这里有几十个业余剧团。这些剧团整年都在演出，每年都有共和国的几百个业余剧团举行会演。
    今年捷克斯洛伐克繁荣的文化生活将从春季继续到夏季。七月将在卡罗维发利举办例行的国际电影节。在许多申请书中我们已经收到来自遥远的中国的申请书。有二十九个国家参加了上一次的电影节。今年我们将接待更多的参加者。
    布拉格的文化生活是丰富多采的。它象征着我们祖国的繁荣，显示了我们人民的幸福生活。
