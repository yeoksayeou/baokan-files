Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend
    -- Speech at Huairentang on May 26, 1956
    Lu Dingyi

Comrade Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, asked me to talk about the Chinese Communist Party's policy on literary and artistic work and scientific work. The Chinese Communist Party advocates letting a hundred flowers bloom in literary and artistic work and letting a hundred schools of thought contend in scientific work. This has already been announced by Chairman Mao at the Supreme State Conference. We have some experience in implementing this policy, but our experience is still very limited. What I want to talk about today is my personal understanding of this policy. Today, natural scientists, social scientists, medical scientists, writers, and artists are present, including Communist Party members, members of various democratic parties, and non-party figures. You can certainly understand the significance of this policy for the development of our country's literature, art, and scientific research, and for the work you are engaged in. If my understanding is incorrect, I hope you will not hesitate to point it out so that our common cause can develop smoothly.

  I. Why was such a policy proposed? Why is such a policy
    being emphasized now?

If China is to become prosperous and strong, in addition to consolidating the people's political power, developing the economy, developing education, and strengthening national defense, it is also necessary to promote the flourishing development of literature, art, and scientific work. Lacking this is not acceptable.

To enable literature, art, and scientific work to flourish, it is necessary to adopt the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend." In literary and artistic work, if "one flower blooms alone," no matter how good that flower is, it will not flourish. Taking the current example, it is drama. A few years ago, some people opposed Peking Opera. At that time, the Party decided to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new" in the field of drama. Now everyone sees that this policy is correct and has achieved great results. Due to the free competition and mutual observation between various opera genres, the progress of drama has been very rapid. In scientific work, China also has historical experience. In the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods two thousand years ago, there was a situation of "a hundred schools of thought contending" in academics, which became the golden age of academic development in China's past history. China's history proves that without encouragement for independent thinking and free discussion, academic development will stagnate. Conversely, with encouragement for independent thinking and free discussion, academics can develop rapidly. The Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods are very different from the present situation. At that time, society was turbulent, and the "hundred schools of thought contending" in academics was spontaneous and without conscious unified leadership. Now, however, the people themselves have created a free world, the people's democratic dictatorship has been established and consolidated, and the people demand the rapid development of scientific work. Therefore, they consciously conduct overall planning for scientific work and adopt the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" to promote the development of academic work.

We must also see that in a class society, literature, art, and scientific work will ultimately become weapons of class struggle.

This issue is more obvious in the field of literature and art. There are some obviously harmful things in literature and art. Hu Feng is an example. Yellow novels that teach robbery and promote pornography are another example. "Playing mahjong, who cares about state affairs," and "The moon in America is rounder than in China" are also examples of so-called literary works. Treating such poisonous literature and art in the same way as flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows, and eliminating them, is entirely correct. This can only benefit literature and art, not harm them. Therefore, we say that there is literature and art that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and there is literature and art that serves imperialism, landlords, and the bourgeoisie. What we need is literature and art that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, literature and art that serves the masses of the people.

In the fields of philosophy and social sciences, class struggle is also more obvious. Everyone has criticized Hu Shi's philosophical, historical, educational, and political views. Criticizing Hu Shi is a reflection of class struggle in the field of social sciences. This criticism, as well as the criticism of Mr. Liang Shuming, was entirely appropriate. The criticism of other bourgeois idealist philosophical schools and bourgeois sociology should also be done.

In the field of natural sciences, although natural science itself has no class nature, natural scientists each have their own political stance. In the past, among some natural scientists, there was blind worship of the United States. There was also a tendency towards so-called "de-politicization" among some natural scientists. Criticizing these bad things is also entirely appropriate. This criticism is also a reflection of class struggle.

We must also see that although literature, art, and scientific research are closely related to class struggle, they are ultimately not completely identical to politics. Political struggle is a direct form of class struggle. Literature and art and social sciences can directly express class struggle, or they can express class struggle in a more circuitous way. To think that literature and science are unrelated to politics, and that they can be "art for art's sake" or "science for science's sake" is a right-leaning one-sided view that is wrong. Conversely, equating literature and science completely with politics will lead to another one-sided view and will commit the "left" simplistic error.

What we advocate in "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is promoting freedom of independent thinking, freedom of debate, freedom of creation and criticism, freedom to express one's opinions, freedom to persist in one's opinions, and freedom to reserve one's opinions in literary and artistic work and scientific research work. (Note 1)
          Note 1: Several scientists wrote letters, believing that it
    is necessary to prevent biases in the understanding of the policy
    of letting a hundred schools of thought contend. Now the letter
    from Mr. Yang Zhaoxun of the Science Press is excerpted and published here.
          Mr. Yang's letter said:
        "The policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is undoubtedly completely correct. But in
    practice, it seems necessary to prevent certain incorrect biases that may arise in the understanding of this policy.
    "As the name implies, the contention should be among those who can be called 'masters' to some extent. However, some people are often content with superficial understanding, are occasionally 'enlightened,' and then become complacent, unwilling to delve deeply, unwilling to do academic work in a down-to-earth manner, so that they fall into a quagmire without knowing it, and instead insist on their mistakes, refusing to bow their heads in the face of truth. The most obvious example is that there are often many people who are unwilling to believe (actually unwilling to study hard) what has been generally recognized and proven, such as why it is impossible to trisect an angle with a compass and straightedge, why perpetual motion is impossible, but they insist on wasting time and energy to discover miracles. The number of people who waste their mental energy on meaningless and clearly doomed-to-fail attempts is probably not small. Some of them may be due to wanting to become a 'master' overnight, to 'startle the world with one鸣,' unwilling to take the arduous path of learning. If you suggest that they put in the effort to study existing conclusions, based on experience, his reply is likely to be easy, saying that it is the theory of bourgeois scholars, is 'idealist'!
    "Similar to the situation described above, experience tells us that some people, especially engineers and technicians, due to objective circumstances in their work, do not have many opportunities to access relevant literature, so they do not bother to check the literature or ask others for advice, but instead painstakingly study a problem on their own, and come to the correct conclusion, but unfortunately, he does not know that someone has already done it even decades ago.
    "To truly become a 'master,' to '鸣' well, it is necessary to go through a long period of hard research and practice. This correct knowledge that should be possessed at least for letting a hundred schools of thought contend seems necessary to be emphasized. Otherwise, in the future, various research units and universities will receive many discoveries or inventions from various 'masters' 鸣ing their '鸣,' and they will have to spend a lot of valuable time reviewing them, and they will have to carefully and patiently explain their impossibility, or point out that predecessors have already done it. In this way, the author's energy is wasted, and the reviewer's energy is also wasted. But if you have a correct understanding of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, you can at least reduce the waste of energy, and further transform the useless into the useful."
    Mr. Yang and several other scientists' opinions on preventing misunderstandings about "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" are based on experience and are reasonable. This misunderstanding, this bias, should be prevented. - Author

The freedom we advocate is different from the freedom advocated by bourgeois democracy. The freedom advocated by the bourgeoisie is only the freedom of a few people, and the working people have no share or very little share. The bourgeoisie exercises dictatorship over the working people. Now the warmongers in the United States tout what they call the "free world," in which the warmongering reactionaries have all the freedom, while the Luxembourgs were sentenced to death because they advocated peace. We advocate not allowing counter-revolutionaries to have freedom, and we advocate that counter-revolutionaries must be subjected to dictatorship. But within the people, we advocate that there must be democracy and freedom. This is a political line: politically, we must distinguish between ourselves and the enemy.

What we advocate in "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is the freedom of the people. We advocate expanding this freedom with the consolidation of the people's political power.

The people are united and yet disunited. China already has a constitution, and abiding by the constitution is the duty of the people. This is the unity of the people. That is to say, loving the motherland and supporting socialism should be the consensus of the people of the whole country. However, there are also differences within the people. In thought, there are distinctions between materialism and idealism. This distinction will exist when classes still exist, and it will exist even after classes are eliminated, even until communist society. When classes still exist, the contradiction between materialism and idealism manifests itself as the contradiction of classes; after classes are eliminated, as long as the contradiction between the subjective and the objective still exists, as long as the contradiction between the advanced and the backward still exists, as long as the contradiction between the social productive forces and the relations of production still exists, then the contradiction between materialism and idealism will also exist in socialist and communist societies. There is a struggle between materialism and idealism, and this struggle will be long-term. Communists are dialectical materialists and of course advocate propagating materialism and opposing idealism. This is unwavering. However, precisely because they are dialectical materialists, precisely because they understand the laws of social development, communists advocate that the ideological struggle within the people must be strictly distinguished from the struggle against counter-revolutionaries. Within the people, there is not only the freedom to propagate materialism, but also the freedom to propagate idealism. As long as they are not counter-revolutionaries, whether they are propagating materialism or idealism, they have freedom. Debate between the two is also free. (Note 2) This is the ideological struggle within the people, which is different from the struggle against counter-revolutionaries. Counter-revolutionaries should be suppressed and overthrown. Backward idealistic ideas within the people should be fought against. This struggle is also sharp, but this struggle starts from unity and is aimed at overcoming backwardness and strengthening unity. It is not effective to try to solve ideological problems with administrative orders. Only through public debate can materialistic ideas gradually overcome idealistic ideas.
        Note 2: Some people think that there should be no freedom
    to propagate idealism in our country. Others think that since
    there is freedom to propagate idealism, then idealists should
    have unlimited freedom to propagate. These views are based on
    misunderstanding. Taking religion as an example, in our country,
    various religions have their own churches, temples, publications,
    publishing organs, and schools for training missionaries. These
    are all free and protected by the state. However, in order to
    benefit the unity between atheists and theists and avoid conflicts,
    atheists do not go to churches and temples to conduct anti-religious
    propaganda, and theists do not conduct religious propaganda in public
    places outside churches and temples. Here, the freedom of propaganda
    for both atheists and theists is limited. - Author

There will also be differences of opinion on artistic issues, academic issues, and technical issues. These differences of opinion are entirely permissible. It is, of course, free to express different opinions, to debate, to criticize, and to counter-criticize on issues of this nature.

In short, we advocate that politically, we must distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and we advocate that there must be freedom within the people. "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is the expression of the freedom of the people in the fields of literature, art, and scientific work.

We are now fully capable of implementing the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend."

What is our situation now?

First, socialist transformation in the basic areas of the country has achieved a decisive victory in all aspects, and the system of exploitation will be eliminated in these areas in the next few years. All the original exploiters will be transformed into self-reliant laborers. Our country will soon become a socialist country without exploiting classes.

Second, the political and ideological situation of the intellectual community has undergone a fundamental change and is undergoing further fundamental changes. This has been explained in detail in Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on intellectuals. Here, let me briefly review the most recent struggle.

The most recent struggle was the struggle against bourgeois idealist thought. In this struggle, the broad masses of intellectuals performed well and made great progress.

In this struggle, the main focus of our academic circles was on Hu Shi and Hu Feng, two counter-revolutionaries, who were not only idealists in thought but also counter-revolutionaries in politics. In addition, the philosophical and socio-political views of Mr. Liang Shuming, and the individualistic bourgeois ideas in literary and art circles, were criticized. Now everyone can see that this struggle was necessary to promote the development of socialist transformation, and therefore this struggle was correct.

In this struggle, the CPC Central Committee instructed that it is necessary to resolutely oppose the ideas that hinder the development of academic criticism and discussion. These ideas are manifested as: the idolatry of bourgeois "celebrities," considering them "authorities" who cannot be criticized; adopting the attitude of bourgeois aristocratic masters towards young Marxist academic workers and suppressing them; some Party members considering themselves "authorities," not allowing others to criticize themselves, and not conducting self-criticism; some Party members being afraid to criticize others because they "fear damaging the united front" or "fear affecting unity"; some Party members not criticizing others' mistakes, or even covering them up, because of personal friendship or face-saving. The CPC Central Committee pointed out that it is necessary to adhere to the principle that no one can have any privileges in academic criticism and discussion; it is wrong to consider oneself an "authority" and suppress criticism, or to turn a blind eye to bourgeois erroneous ideas and adopt a liberal or even capitulationist attitude. At the same time, the CPC Central Committee instructed that academic criticism and discussion should be reasoned and based on facts. That is to say, sharp academic debates based on scientific foundations should be advocated. Criticism and discussion should be based on research work, and simple and crude attitudes should be opposed. The method of free discussion should be adopted, and the method of administrative orders should be opposed. Those who are criticized should be allowed to make counter-criticisms, rather than suppressing such counter-criticisms. The minority who hold different opinions should be allowed to retain their opinions, rather than implementing the principle of minority obeying the majority. For those who have made mistakes on academic issues, if they are unwilling to publish articles to examine their mistakes after criticism and discussion, they do not necessarily have to write articles of self-criticism. In academic circles, if different opinions arise after a conclusion has been reached on a certain academic issue, discussion is still allowed. The CPC Central Committee also instructed: When conducting criticism of bourgeois erroneous ideas and criticism and discussion of academic issues, the Party's united front policy and the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals should be adhered to. Those who adhere to bourgeois erroneous views in thought should be distinguished from those who have such erroneous views but tend towards materialism, and they should be treated differently. Counter-revolutionaries in politics should be distinguished from those who have made mistakes in academic thought. Academic workers who have serious bourgeois erroneous views in academic thought, as long as they are not counter-revolutionaries in politics, should be guaranteed to obtain work positions suitable for them, guaranteed that they can continue to conduct research useful to society, their expertise useful to society should be respected and brought into play, and this expertise should be passed on to young people. At the same time, they should be encouraged to actively participate in academic criticism and discussion and to carry out self-transformation.

These instructions ensured that we did not commit major errors in the work of opposing bourgeois idealist thought and developing academic criticism. Now, in retrospect, this struggle was basically done correctly, and the grasp of the degree was generally correct. However, there were still errors and shortcomings. For example, Mr. Yu Pingbo, he is a good person politically, but he only made mistakes in literary work and academic thought. It is necessary to criticize his mistakes in academic thought, and some of the articles criticizing Mr. Yu at that time were indeed well written. However, some articles were written worse, lacking sufficient persuasive power, and the tone was too intense. As for the claim that he monopolized ancient books, it is unfounded. I want to clarify this situation here.

Let's look back and look at the present. Then, the current situation is very different from the past. If one or two years ago, bourgeois idealism still had a large market, and the Hu Feng clique was still rampaging on the ideological front, and many intellectuals could not distinguish between materialistic and idealistic thought, and did not know the harm of bourgeois idealistic thought to the socialist cause, then today our ideological circles have made great progress.

Currently, some departments have not completed the original plan for the criticism of Hu Shi and Hu Feng's reactionary ideas, and the work of eliminating hidden counter-revolutionaries has not been completed. Whatever has not been completed should be carried out to the end and should not be abandoned halfway. Because only by doing these things well can favorable conditions be created for many future tasks. In this struggle, it must be repeatedly emphasized that we unite with the good people, including the backward elements, who account for more than 90% of the total number of people, and jointly fight against counter-revolutionaries.

Third, we still have enemies, and there is still class struggle in the country, but the enemies, especially the domestic enemies, have been greatly weakened.

Who are the enemies? Abroad, there are imperialist aggressive forces headed by American warmongers; at home, there is the Chiang Kai-shek group entrenched in Taiwan, as well as other remaining counter-revolutionaries. These are our enemies. We must continue to fight resolutely against these enemies and not slacken.

Fourth, the political and ideological unity of the people of the whole country has been greatly enhanced and is continuing to be enhanced.

It is precisely in view of this situation that the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is now focusing on putting forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," which is to mobilize all positive factors in literary, artistic, and scientific work to better serve the people, to strive to promote the flourishing of our country's literature and art, and to strive to bring our country's scientific work up to the advanced world level.

Currently, many of our natural scientists are drafting a twelve-year plan for the development of natural science under the leadership of the government, and a twelve-year development plan for philosophy and social sciences is also being drafted. Formulating and implementing these plans is the glorious task of our scientific community. Implementing the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is an important guarantee for completing this task.

                II. Strengthening Unity

"Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is a policy for mobilizing all positive factors, and therefore it is also a policy for strengthening unity. Unity on what basis? On the basis of patriotism, on the basis of socialism. What do we unite to do? To build a new socialist China and to fight against domestic and foreign enemies.

There are two different kinds of unity. One is the unity of mechanical obedience, and the other is the unity of conscious willingness. What we want is the unity of conscious willingness.

Are our literary and scientific circles united? They are united. Compared with the time when the People's Republic of China was first established, the literary and scientific circles have made great progress in terms of unity. The work of social reform and ideological transformation is the reason why we can have such solid unity today. It is wrong to deny or ignore this. But this does not mean that our unity is perfect. There are still shortcomings in unity.

Where are the shortcomings? First of all, some Communist Party members have forgotten Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and the harm of sectarianism. Achievements in work often make some people's heads swell, and the mood of complacency and arrogance develops, and the mood of sectarianism develops.

  Comrade Mao Zedong said in 1942, in the article "Rectify the Party's Style of Work":

    "Many of our comrades like to be condescending to non-Party members, look down on them, despise them, and are unwilling to respect them, unwilling to understand their strengths. This is the tendency of sectarianism. These comrades, after reading a few books on Marxism, are not more humble, but more arrogant, always saying that others are not good, but they do not know that they are really half-baked. Our comrades must understand a truth: Communist Party members are always in the minority compared with non-Party members. Assuming that there is one Communist Party member in every hundred people, there are 4.5 million Communist Party members in China's 450 million people. Even if such a large number is reached, Communist Party members still only account for one percent, and ninety-nine percent are non-Party members. What reason do we have not to cooperate with non-Party members? For all those who are willing to cooperate with us and may cooperate with us, we only have the obligation to cooperate with them, and we have absolutely no right to exclude them. Some Party members do not understand this principle, look down on those who are willing to cooperate with us, and even exclude them. This is not based on anything. Did Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin give us this basis? No. On the contrary, they always earnestly warned us to closely link with the masses and not to be separated from the masses. Did the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party give us this basis? No.
    None of the Central Committee's resolutions says that we can separate ourselves from the masses and isolate ourselves. On the contrary, the Central Committee always calls on us to closely link with the masses and not to be separated from the masses. Therefore, all behavior that is separated from the masses has no basis, but only the sectarianism that our own comrades have created is at work. Because this sectarianism is still very serious among some comrades and is still hindering the implementation of the Party's line, we must carry out extensive education within the Party to address this issue. First of all, we must make our cadres truly understand the seriousness of this issue, so that they understand that if Communist Party members do not unite with non-Party cadres and non-Party members, the enemy will certainly not be defeated, and the purpose of the revolution will certainly not be achieved." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 3, pp. 827-8)

As everyone knows, in recent years, we have conducted several anti-sectarian struggles within the Party in literary and scientific circles. This struggle has been carried out in health work departments, in natural science research departments, in literary and artistic work departments, and in social science work departments. We must continue this struggle and call on Party members working in literary and scientific circles to pay attention to overcoming sectarianism.

In the course of the struggle, we have explored several experiences, which I will now talk about.

      (1) Everyone knows that natural science, including medicine, has no class nature. They have their own laws of development. Their relationship with the social system is only that under a bad social system, these sciences will develop more slowly, and under a better social system, they can develop faster. These are problems that have long been solved in theory. Therefore, it is wrong to attach class labels such as "feudal," "capitalist," "socialist," "proletarian," or "bourgeois" to a certain medical theory, biological theory, or other natural science theory, such as saying that "traditional Chinese medicine is feudal medicine, Western medicine is capitalist medicine," "Pavlov's theory is socialist," "Michurin's theory is socialist," "Mendel-Morgan genetics is capitalist," and so on. We must not believe it. Some people who make this kind of mistake do so because of sectarian ideas, while others make this kind of mistake unconsciously because they emphasize learning from the advanced science of the Soviet Union too much. These different situations should be treated differently and not generalized.

While pointing out the above errors, we must also point out another error. This error is denying that Pavlov's theory and Michurin's theory are important theories. People who make this kind of mistake have different starting points. Some do so because they have anti-Soviet sentiments in politics, and therefore even deny the scientific achievements of the Soviet Union. Others do so because they are from different schools and cannot be convinced. The former is a political issue, and the latter is an academic issue, and they should also be treated differently and not generalized.

      (2) The Party has only one requirement for literary and artistic work, which is "to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Today, it also means serving all working people, including intellectuals. We believe that socialist realism is the best creative method, but it is not the only creative method. Under the premise of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, any writer can use any method they think is best to create and compete with each other. The Party has never restricted the subject matter. It is wrong to only allow writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers, only allow writing about the new society, only allow writing about new characters, etc. Since literature and art are to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, they must, of course, praise the new society and positive characters, and at the same time criticize the old society and negative characters, praise progress, and criticize backwardness. Therefore, the subject matter of literature and art should be very broad. What appears in literary and artistic works can not only be things that exist in the world and have existed in history, but also immortals in the sky, talking birds and beasts, etc., things that do not exist in the world. Literary and artistic works can write about positive characters and the new society, and they can also write about negative characters and the old society. Moreover, without the old society, it is difficult to set off the new society, and without negative characters, it is difficult to set off positive characters. Therefore, rules and regulations on the subject matter will only stifle literary and artistic work, develop formalism and low taste, and are harmful and useless. As for the issues of artistic characteristics, typical creation, etc., they should be freely discussed by literary and artistic workers, and various different opinions can be allowed, and gradually reach a consensus in free discussion.

The literary and artistic circles have already had the experience of implementing "letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new" in the field of drama. This is a very valuable experience. The problem now is to promote the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" to all literary and artistic departments.

      (3) In the fields of philosophy and social sciences, the work achievements are great. But because of this, the danger of sectarianism is also greater. If attention is not paid in time, serious consequences of ideological rigidity may occur. Since the founding of the country, it has been correct, necessary, and successful to promote Marxism-Leninism among the broad masses of intellectuals, to carry out ideological transformation movements, to conduct struggles against bourgeois idealism, and to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries. However, we should also see the dark side. Some Party members have developed the idea of monopolizing academic work in philosophy and social sciences, are self-righteous, cannot see or even forget the strengths of others, cannot see the progress of others, cannot listen to criticisms, and always consider themselves teachers, treating others as if they are only fit to be their students forever, and as if they can only be idealists or bourgeois scholars forever. This is very dangerous. If this continues, individuals will be in danger of degeneration, and the cause of philosophy and social sciences will become stagnant and lifeless. These comrades should quickly stop being intoxicated, be more humble, listen to more criticisms from others, do more scholarship, consult with non-Party members more, and cooperate well with them, so as not to cause losses to the cause of philosophy and social sciences.

In view of the fact that it has been almost seven years since the founding of the country, although there are still some people who adhere to idealistic ideas and bourgeois ideas, many people have made great progress. Consideration should be given to gradually reorganizing forces and changing some systems and methods that were originally wrong and those that were not originally wrong but are now outdated in the research and education work of philosophy and social sciences, according to the situation, so as to mobilize all positive factors and develop our country's philosophical and social science cause. Philosophy and social sciences are extremely important scientific departments, so we must do our job well.

Here, I want to talk about the issue of modern history in passing. Modern history is an extremely important department in social sciences, but there have not been many achievements in recent years. It is said that everyone is waiting for the CPC Central Committee to compile a textbook on Party history, and then write various modern histories based on the textbook on Party history. Now, please don't wait any longer. The CPC Central Committee is not preparing to compile a textbook on Party history, but only preparing to publish records of major Party events and compilations of documents one after another. Our modern history scholars should independently study various issues in modern history. In the study of modern history, the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend should also be adopted, and no other policy should be adopted.

Eliminate sectarianism, unite all those who are willing to cooperate or may cooperate; eliminate the idea of monopoly, eliminate excessive rules and regulations, implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend"; do not only plan for the interests of yourself, your department, or your unit, and help others, other departments, and other units more; eliminate arrogance and self-importance, and implement humility and prudence, and respect others. In this way, we can eliminate the shortcomings in our past unity and greatly strengthen unity.

We hope that non-Party writers and scientists will also pay attention to the issue of strengthening unity. I want to repeat here a passage from Comrade Zhou Enlai's "Report on the Question of Intellectuals."

"There is still some estrangement between some intellectuals and our Party. We must take the initiative to work hard to eliminate this estrangement. But this estrangement often comes from two aspects: on the one hand, it is because our comrades have not approached them and understood them; and on the other hand, it is because some intellectuals have adopted a reserved attitude, or even an opposing attitude, towards socialism. In our enterprises, schools, and institutions, and in society, there are still such intellectuals: they do not distinguish between ourselves, the enemy, the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, and between the Chinese people and the imperialist; they are dissatisfied with the policies and measures of the Party and the People's Government, and are nostalgic for capitalism or even feudalism; they oppose the Soviet Union and are unwilling to learn from the Soviet Union; they refuse to study Marxism-Leninism and slander Marxism-Leninism; they despise labor, despise the working people, despise cadres from the working people, and are unwilling to approach workers, peasants, and worker-peasant cadres; they are unwilling to see the growth of new forces, and think that progressive elements are opportunists; they not only often create disputes and opposition between intellectuals and the Party, but also create disputes and opposition among intellectuals; they are arrogant and think that they are the best in the world, and cannot accept the leadership of anyone or the criticism of anyone; they deny the interests of the people and the interests of society, and look at all problems from the perspective of personal interests, and approve of what is in their own interests and oppose what is not in their own interests. Of course, there are very few people among the intellectuals today who have all these faults; but there are not a few who have one or several of the above faults. Not only backward elements, but also some middle elements often have some of the above erroneous views. The shortcomings of narrow-mindedness, arrogance, and looking at problems from the perspective of personal interests are still quite common among progressive elements. If such intellectuals do not change their position, even if we work hard to approach them, there will still be estrangement between them and us."

That is to say, in order to strengthen unity, the efforts of Communist Party members are required, as well as the efforts of non-Communist Party members.

Individualism and departmentalism also exist in literary and scientific circles. The estrangement between new and old scientific workers also exists. These bad things should all be eliminated. We believe that they can certainly be eliminated. As long as Communist Party members set an example and work hard together with non-Party members, the problem will be solved smoothly.

        III. The Issue of Criticism and the Issue of Learning

"Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" means freedom of criticism and freedom of counter-criticism for criticism work.

The current criticism is frightening to some people. If it is not frightening, it is often bland and tasteless. How should this problem be solved?

There are two kinds of criticism. One is criticism of the enemy, so-called "beating them to death with one blow" criticism, or combative criticism. The other is criticism of good people, which is well-intentioned, comradely criticism, which starts from unity and reaches the goal of unity through struggle. This kind of criticism must take the overall situation into account and adopt an attitude of reasoning and being kind to others, and cannot use the attitude of the "fake foreign devil" in The True Story of Ah Q who said, "Revolution is not allowed."

Whether it is the former criticism or the latter criticism, it must rely on research. Do not write after seeing a little bit, but write after seeing a lot and thinking a lot.

There is a wrong idea, which is that criticism must be a blow. During the Yan'an period, there was a counter-revolutionary element named Wang Shiwei, and later there was a counter-revolutionary element named Hu Feng. They used "essays" and other forms to attack the Party and the people's political power. Of course, it is right to strike back at these counter-revolutionaries. But if this method of attack is also used within the people, it is wrong.

For criticism of good people, I would like to introduce four articles: 1. Mao Zedong: "Reform Our Study"; 2. Mao Zedong: "Rectify the Party's Style of Work"; 3. Mao Zedong: "Oppose Party Eight-Legged Essay"; 4. People's Daily: "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." The first three articles are criticisms of Comrades Wang Ming and Bo Gu, who were comrades who made major mistakes at the time; the last article is a criticism of Comrade Stalin, who was a comrade who had great merits and great mistakes, and whose merits outweighed his mistakes. After reading these criticisms, you will know that there can be criticisms that are neither excessive attacks nor painless, but can benefit many people. You can see how much hard research work has gone into writing such criticisms. This kind of criticism is precisely what we should advocate.

Climbing the peaks of science and art is a very difficult task. It is difficult because here you can only seek truth from facts and cannot be playful at all. We should give scientists and artists full support. All scientists and writers who are working honestly should only receive support and should not be attacked under our social system. It is impossible not to make mistakes at all in independent thinking and complex creative labor. First, just the lack of knowledge sometimes makes people make wrong judgments. Second, exaggerating something that

    百花齐放，百家争鸣
    ——一九五六年五月二十六日在怀仁堂的讲话
    陆定一
    中国科学院院长和中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若先生，要我来讲讲中国共产党对文艺工作和科学工作的政策。中国共产党对文艺工作主张百花齐放，对科学工作主张百家争鸣，这已经由毛主席在最高国务会议上宣布过了。执行这个政策，我们已经有了部分的经验，但是我们的经验还是很少的。我今天所要讲的，是个人对这个政策的认识。今天到会的都是自然科学家、社会科学家、医学家、文学家和艺术家，有共产党员，也有各民主党派的和无党无派的朋友。你们当然能够了解，这个政策对于我国文学艺术和科学研究工作的发展，对于你们所从事的工作，有何等重要的意义。我的了解如有不对的地方，希望大家不吝指正，使我们的共同事业能够顺利发展。
  一、为什么提出这样的政策？为什么
    现在才着重提出这样的政策？
    我国要富强，除了必须巩固人民的政权，必须发展经济，发展教育事业，加强国防以外，还必须使文学艺术和科学工作得到繁荣的发展，缺少这一条是不行的。
    要使文学艺术和科学工作得到繁荣的发展，必须采取“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策。文艺工作，如果“一花独放”，无论那朵花怎么好，也是不会繁荣的。拿眼前的例子来说，就是戏剧。几年以前，还有人反对京戏。那时，党决定在戏剧方面实行“百花齐放，推陈出新”的政策。现在大家都看到，这个政策是正确的，收到了巨大的效果。由于有了各剧种之间的自由竞赛和相互观摩，戏剧的进步就很快。在科学工作方面，我国也有历史经验。我国在两千年前的春秋战国时代，学术方面曾经出现过“百家争鸣”的局面，这成了我国过去历史上学术发展的黄金时代。我国的历史证明，如果没有对独立思考的鼓励，没有自由讨论，那末，学术的发展就会停滞。反过来说，有了对独立思考的鼓励，有了自由讨论，学术就能迅速发展。春秋战国时代同现在的情况是大不相同的。当时，社会是动乱的，学术方面的“百家争鸣”是自发的而没有有意识的统一领导的。现在，却是人民自己打出了自由的天地，人民民主专政已经建立起来而且巩固起来了，人民要求科学工作的迅速发展，因而自觉地对科学工作进行全盘的规划，并采取“百家争鸣”的政策来促进学术工作的发展。
    我们又要看到，在阶级社会里，文学艺术和科学工作毕竟要成为阶级斗争的武器。
    这个问题，在文学艺术的领域里，是比较明显的。文学艺术中有一些显然有害的东西。胡风就是一个例子。诲盗诲淫的黄色小说又是一个例子。“打打麻将，国事管他娘”，“美国月亮比中国的圆”这些所谓文学作品又是一些例子。把这样的有毒的文艺，同苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀一例看待，加以消灭，是完全应该的。这对文艺只有好处，没有坏处。所以，我们说，有为工农兵服务的文艺，有为帝国主义、地主、资产阶级服务的文艺。我们所需要的，是为工农兵服务的文艺，为人民大众服务的文艺。
    在哲学和社会科学的领域里，阶级斗争也是比较明显的。胡适的哲学观点，历史学观点，教育学观点和政治观点，大家都批判过了。批判胡适，这是阶级斗争在社会科学领域里的反映。这个批判，以及对梁漱溟先生的批判，是完全应该做的。对其他资产阶级唯心主义的哲学派别和资产阶级社会学的批判，也是应该做的。
    在自然科学领域里，虽然自然科学本身没有阶级性，但自然科学工作者却是每个人都有自己的政治立场的。从前，在一部分自然科学家中间，有过盲目崇拜美国的思想。在一部分自然科学家中也有所谓“非政治化”的倾向。批判这些坏东西也是完全应该的。这种批判，也就是阶级斗争的反映。
    我们还必须看到，文学艺术和科学研究，虽然同阶级斗争密切有关，可是它和政治终究不是完全相同的。政治斗争，是阶级斗争的直接的表现形式，文艺和社会科学，可以直接地表现阶级斗争，也可以比较曲折地表现阶级斗争。以为文艺和科学同政治无关，可以“为艺术而艺术”，“为科学而科学”，这是一种右的片面性的看法，是错误的。反之，把文艺和科学同政治完全等同起来，就会发生另一种片面性的看法，就会犯“左”的简单化的错误。
    我们所主张的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”是提倡在文学艺术工作和科学研究工作中有独立思考的自由，有辩论的自由，有创作和批评的自由，有发表自己的意见、坚持自己的意见和保留自己的意见的自由。（注一）
          注一：几位科学家来信，认为应该防止对百家
    争鸣的政策在认识上发生偏向。现在把科学出版社
    杨肇燫先生的来信摘要发表在这里。
          杨先生的信说：
        “百家争鸣的方针毫无疑问是完全正确的。但在
    实际上对这一方针的认识似乎要防止很可能有的某些不正确的偏向。
    “顾名思义，争鸣的应当是多少可以称为‘家’的。可是有一些人往往安于浅赏，偶有一‘得’，便沾沾自喜，不肯深入钻研，不肯脚踏实地去做学术工夫，以致陷入泥坑而不知返，反而坚持错误，在真理面前还不肯低头。最显著的例子，就是经常有不少的人不肯相信（其实是不肯艰苦学习）已经公认为证明了的为什么用圆规和直尺三等分角是不可能的，为什么永动机是不可能的，而偏偏要白费时间和脑力去发现奇迹。这种把精神智慧消耗于毫无意义的、明明注定要失败的企图上的人，为数恐不在少。其中有些人恐不免是由于要想隔夜成‘家’，一‘鸣’惊人，不愿去走崎岖的学习途径。如果向他们建议去下工夫进行学习已有的结论，根据经验，很可能他的答复会轻松地说，那是资产阶级学者的理论，是‘唯心’的！
    “与上面所说的情形相仿，经验告诉我们，有些人，尤其是工程师和技术工作者，由于业务上的客观情况，不大有机会去接触相关的文献，因此就不努力去查文献或向人请教，而径自苦心孤诣地去研究一个问题，并且得出了正确的结果，可是很不幸，他还不知道早已有人甚至在几十年前就已经作好了。
    “要真正成‘家’，要喤喤善‘鸣’，是需要经过一段长时期艰苦钻研和实践的历程的。这一点对百家争鸣起码应该具备的正确知识，似乎有必要着重予以指出。否则，今后各研究单位、各高等学校将会收到很多‘家’各‘鸣’其‘鸣’的发现或发明，还得花费不少宝贵时间予以审阅，还得小心翼翼地耐烦地说明其不可能，或指出其已有前人作过。这样，作者的精力固然白费了，审查人的精力也是白费的。但如果对百家争鸣具有正确的认识，至少可以减少精力的浪费，进一步还可化无用为有用。”
    杨先生和好几位别的科学家关于防止对“百家争鸣”发生误解的意见，是经验之谈，是有道理的。这种误解，这种偏向，是应该防止的。——作者我们所主张的自由，是同资产阶级民主主义所主张的自由不同的。资产阶级所主张的自由，只是少数人的自由，劳动人民是没有份或者很少有份的。资产阶级对劳动人民是实行专政的。现在美国的好战分子标榜什么“自由世界”，在那个“世界”里，好战分子反动派有一切自由，而卢森堡夫妇却被处以死刑，因为他们主张和平。我们是主张不许反革命分子有自由的，我们主张对反革命分子一定要实行专政。但是在人民内部，我们主张一定要有民主自由。这是一条政治界线：政治上必须分清敌我。
    我们所主张的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，是人民内部的自由。我们主张随着人民政权的巩固而扩大这种自由。
    人民内部是一致的又是不一致的。我国已经有了宪法，遵守宪法是人民的义务，这就是人民内部的一致性。这就是说，爱祖国，拥护社会主义，是全国人民都应该一致的。但是，人民内部也有不一致的地方，在思想上有唯物主义和唯心主义的分别，这种分别，在阶级还存在的时候会有，在阶级消灭以后还会有，一直到共产主义社会还会有。在阶级还存在的时候，唯物主义和唯心主义之间的矛盾表现为阶级的矛盾；在阶级消灭以后，只要还存在着主观和客观的矛盾，还存在着先进和落后的矛盾，还存在着社会生产力和生产关系的矛盾，那末，唯物主义和唯心主义的矛盾在社会主义社会和共产主义社会中也还将存在。唯物主义和唯心主义之间，是有斗争的，而且这种斗争将是长期的。共产党人是辩证唯物主义者，当然主张宣传唯物主义，反对唯心主义，这是不可动摇的。但是，正因为是辩证唯物主义者，正因为了解了社会发展的规律，所以共产党人主张必须把人民内部的思想斗争同对反革命分子的斗争严格地区别开来。在人民内部，不但有宣传唯物主义的自由，也有宣传唯心主义的自由。只要不是反革命分子，不管是宣传唯物主义或者是宣传唯心主义，都是有自由的。两者之间的辩论，也是自由的。（注二）这是人民内部的思想斗争，同对反革命分子所进行的斗争是不同的。对反革命，应该镇压，应该打倒。对人民内部的唯心主义的落后思想，应该进行斗争，这个斗争也是尖锐的，但这个斗争是从团结出发的，是为了克服落后，加强团结。对于思想问题，想用行政命令的办法来解决，是不会有效的。只有经过公开辩论，唯物主义的思想才能一步步克服唯心主义的思想。
        注二：有人以为，在我国不应该有宣传唯心主
    义的自由。也有人以为，既然有宣传唯心主义的自
    由，那末唯心主义者就应该有无限的宣传自由。这
    些看法，都是出于误解。以宗教为例来说，在我国，
    各种宗教都有自己的教堂、寺庙、刊物、出版机关，
    还有训练传教干部的学校，这些都是自由的而且受
    到国家的保护的。但是，为了有利于无神论者和有
    神论者之间的团结，避免发生冲突起见，无神论者
    不到教堂、寺庙里去做反宗教宣传，有神论者不在
    教堂、寺庙以外的公共场所进行宗教宣传，这里，
    无神论者和有神论者双方在宣传上的自由又是有限
    度的。——作者
    在艺术性质的问题上，在学术性质的问题上，在技术性质的问题上，也会有意见的不同。这种意见上的不同，是完全容许的。在这类性质的问题上，发表不同的意见，进行辩论，进行批评和反批评，当然是自由的。
    总而言之，我们主张政治上必须分清敌我，我们又主张人民内部一定要有自由。“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，是人民内部的自由在文艺工作和科学工作领域中的表现。
    我们现在已经完全有条件来实行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策了。
    我们现在的情形是怎样呢？
  第一，社会主义改造在全国基本地区内已在各方面取得决定性的胜利，剥削制度将在今后几年内在这些地区被消灭。一切原有的剥削者将被改造成为自食其力的劳动者。我国即将成为没有剥削阶级的社会主义国家。
  第二，知识界的政治思想状况已经有了根本的变化，并且正在发生更进一步的根本变化。这在周恩来同志关于知识分子问题的报告中已经说得很详细。在这里，让我略为回顾一下最近的一次斗争。
    最近的一次斗争，是反对资产阶级唯心主义思想的斗争。在这次斗争中，广大的知识分子表现得很好，进步很大。
    在这个斗争中，我们学术界的主要锋芒，集中在胡适和胡风这两个反革命分子身上，他们不仅思想上是唯心主义者，而且政治上是反革命分子。此外，还对梁漱溟先生的哲学和社会政治观点，对文艺界中的个人主义的资产阶级思想等等进行了批判。现在大家都可以看得见，这种斗争对于推动社会主义改造的发展是必要的，因而这个斗争是正确的。
    在这个斗争中，中共中央曾经指示，必须坚决反对阻碍开展学术批评和讨论的思想，这些思想表现为：对资产阶级“名人”的偶像崇拜，认为他们是“权威”，不能批评；对青年的马克思主义的学术工作者采取资产阶级贵族老爷的态度，对他们实行压制；某些党员以“权威”自居，不许别人批评自己，不进行自我批评；某些党员因为“怕破坏统一战线”“怕影响团结”不敢批评别人；某些党员因为私人友情或情面的关系，对别人的错误不去批评，甚至加以掩护。中共中央指出，必须坚持这样的原则：在学术批评和讨论中，任何人都不能有什么特权；以“权威”自居，压制批评，或者对资产阶级错误思想熟视无睹，采取自由主义甚至投降主义的态度，都是不对的。同时，中共中央又指示，学术批评和讨论，应当是说理的，实事求是的。这就是说，应当提倡建立在科学基础上的尖锐的学术论争。批评和讨论应当以研究工作为基础，反对采取简单、粗暴的态度。应当采取自由讨论的方法，反对采取行政命令的方法。应当容许被批评者进行反批评，而不是压制这种反批评。应当容许持有不同意见的少数人保留自己的意见，而不是实行少数服从多数的原则。对于在学术问题上犯了错误的人，经过批评和讨论后，如果不愿意发表文章检讨自己的错误，不一定要他写检讨的文章。在学术界，对于某一学术问题已经做了结论之后，如果又发生不同的意见，仍然容许讨论。中共中央又指示：在进行对资产阶级错误思想的批判和学术问题的批评和讨论时，应当坚持党的统一战线政策和团结改造知识分子的政策。应当把在思想上坚持资产阶级错误观点的人，和虽有这种错误观点但是倾向于唯物主义的人区别开来，分别对待。应当分清政治上的反革命分子和学术思想上犯错误的人。学术思想上有严重的资产阶级错误观点的学术工作者，只要政治上不是反革命分子，都应当保障他们获得适合于他们的工作岗位，保障他们有可能继续进行对于社会有用的研究，尊重和发挥他们对社会有用的专长，并将这种专长传授给青年，同时鼓励他们积极参加学术的批评和讨论，实行自我改造。
    这些指示，保证了我们在反对资产阶级唯心主义思想和开展学术批评的工作中不犯重大错误。现在检查起来，这个斗争基本上是做得对的，在分寸的掌握上也大体是对的。但错误和缺点还是有的。例如俞平伯先生，他政治上是好人，只是犯了在文艺工作中学术思想上的错误。对他在学术思想上的错误加以批判是必要的，当时确有一些批判俞先生的文章是写得好的。但是有一些文章则写得差一些，缺乏充分的说服力量，语调也过分激烈了一些。至于有人说他把古籍垄断起来，则是并无根据的说法。这种情况，我要在这里解释清楚。
    我们回顾一下，再看现在。那末，现在的情形已经同过去有很大的不同了，如果在一两年前，资产阶级唯心主义还有很大的市场，胡风之流还在思想战线上猖狂进攻，很多知识分子不能辨别什么是唯物主义思想、什么是唯心主义思想，不知道资产阶级唯心主义思想对社会主义事业有什么危害，那末，今天我们思想界已经大有进步。
    现在，有些部门对胡适、胡风的反动思想的批判工作的原定计划还没有做完，肃清暗藏的反革命分子的工作也没有做完。凡是没有做完的，应该贯彻进行到底，不可以半途而废。因为只有把这些工作做好了，才能为今后的很多工作创造出有利的条件。在这个斗争中还必须再三强调团结占全体人数百分之九十几的好人，包括落后的分子在内，共同对反革命分子进行斗争。
  第三，我们还有敌人，国内也还有阶级斗争，但是敌人特别是国内的敌人已经大大削弱了。
    敌人是谁呢？在国外，有以美国好战分子为首的帝国主义侵略势力，在国内，有盘据台湾的蒋介石集团，还有其他残余的反革命分子。这些就是我们的敌人。对这些敌人，仍然必须继续坚决斗争，不能松懈。
    第四，全国人民政治上思想上的一致性大大增强，而且还在继续增强之中。
    正是估计到这样的情况，所以中国共产党中央现在着重提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策，就是要我们在文艺工作和科学工作方面，也把一切积极因素都调动起来，更好地为人民服务，为繁荣我国的文学艺术而努力，为使我国的科学工作赶上世界先进水平而努力。
    现在，我们许多自然科学工作者正在政府领导之下草拟关于自然科学发展的十二年的规划，哲学和社会科学的十二年发展规划也正在拟定的过程中。制定和实现这些规划，是我们科学界的光荣任务。贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，是完成这个任务的一个重要保证。
                二、加强团结
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”，既是为了动员一切积极因素，所以又是一个加强团结的政策。在什么基础上的团结？在爱国主义的基础上，在社会主义的基础上。团结起来干什么？建设社会主义的新中国，并且同内外敌人作斗争。
    有两种不同的团结。一种是机械服从的团结，一种是自觉自愿的团结。我们所要的，是自觉自愿的团结。
    我们的文艺界科学界是不是团结的呢？是团结的。同中华人民共和国开始建立的时候比较起来，文艺界和科学界在团结方面是大有进步了。社会改革的工作和思想改造的工作，是我们所以能有今天这样的坚固团结的原因，否认或忽视这一点是不对的。但这决不是说，我们的团结已经十全十美了。团结方面还有缺点。
    缺点在那里？首先在于有些共产党员忘记了毛泽东同志的指示，忘记了宗派主义的害处。工作中的成绩，往往会使一些人冲昏头脑，居功自傲的情绪就会发展起来，宗派主义的情绪就会发展起来。
      毛泽东同志在一九四二年，在“整顿党的作风”一文中说：
    “我们的许多同志，喜欢对党外人员妄自尊大，看人家不起，藐视人家，而不愿尊重人家，不愿了解人家的长处。这就是宗派主义的倾向。这些同志，读了几本马克思主义的书籍之后，不是更谦虚，而是更骄傲了，总是说人家不行，而不知自己实在是一知半解。我们的同志必须懂得一条真理：共产党员和党外人员相比较，无论何时都是占少数。假定一百个人中有一个共产党员，全中国四亿五千万人中就有四百五十万共产党员。即使达到这样大的数目，共产党员也还是只占百分之一，百分之九十九都是非党员。我们有什么理由不和非党人员合作呢？对于一切愿意同我们合作以及可能同我们合作的人，我们只有同他们合作的义务，绝无排斥他们的权利。一部分党员却不懂得这个道理，看不起愿意同我们合作的人，甚至排斥他们。这是没有任何根据的。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林给了我们这样的根据么？没有。相反地，他们总是谆谆告诫我们，要密切联系群众，而不要脱离群众。中国共产党中央给了我们这个根据么？没有。
    中央的一切决议案中，没有一个决议说是我们可以脱离群众使自己孤立起来。相反地，中央总是叫我们密切联系群众，而不要脱离群众。所以，一切脱离群众的行为，并没有任何的根据，只是我们一部分同志自己造出来的宗派主义思想在那里作怪。因为这种宗派主义在一部分同志中还很严重，还在障碍党的路线的实行，所以我们要针对这个问题在党内进行广大的教育。首先要使我们的干部真正懂得这个问题的严重性，使他们懂得共产党员如果不同党外干部、党外人员互相联合，敌人就一定不能打倒，革命的目的就一定不能达到。”（毛泽东选集第三卷827—8页）
    大家都知道，几年以来，我们在文艺界科学界中，曾在党内进行了几次反宗派主义的斗争。这种斗争，在卫生工作部门中，在自然科学研究部门中，在文学艺术工作部门中，在社会科学工作部门中，都曾经进行过。我们还要继续进行这种斗争，并且号召在文艺界和科学界工作的党员，都起来注意克服宗派主义。
    在斗争过程中，我们摸索出了几条经验，现在要来说一说。
      （一）大家都知道，自然科学包括医学在内是没有阶级性的。它们有自己的发展规律。它们同社会制度的关系，仅仅在于：在不好的社会制度之下，这些科学要发展得慢些，在较好的社会制度下就能发展得快些。这些本来是在理论上早已解决了的问题。因此，在某一种医学学说上，生物学或其他自然科学的学说上，贴上什么“封建”“资本主义”“社会主义”“无产阶级”“资产阶级”之类的阶级标签，例如说什么“中医是封建医，西医是资本主义医”，“巴甫洛夫的学说是社会主义的”，“米丘林的学说是社会主义的”，“孟德尔——莫尔根的遗传学是资本主义的”之类，就是错误的。我们切勿相信。犯这种错误的人，有的是因为宗派主义的思想，有的却因为要强调学习苏联的先进科学而强调得不恰当，不自觉地犯这种错误的。对于这种种不同的情况，都要分别对待，不能一概而论。
    在指出上述错误的同时，我们也要指出另一种错误。这种错误就是否认巴甫洛夫学说和米丘林学说是重要的学说。犯这种错误的人，又有不同的出发点。有的是因为政治上有反苏情绪，因而连苏联的科学成就也要加以否认。有的是因为学派不同，不能心服。前者是政治观点问题，后者是学术思想问题，也要不同对待，不能一概而论。
      （二）对于文学艺术工作，党只有一个要求，就是“为工农兵服务”，今天来说，也就是为包括知识分子在内的一切劳动人民服务。社会主义现实主义，我们认为是最好的创作方法，但并不是唯一的创作方法；在为工农兵服务的前提下，任何作家可以用任何自己认为最好的方法来创作，互相竞赛。题材问题，党从未加以限制。只许写工农兵题材，只许写新社会，只许写新人物等等，这种限制是不对的。文艺既然要为工农兵服务，当然要歌颂新社会和正面人物，同时也要批评旧社会和反面人物，要歌颂进步，同时要批评落后，所以，文艺题材应该非常宽广。在文艺作品里出现的，不但可以有世界上存在着的和历史上存在过的东西，也可以有天上的仙人、会说话的禽兽等等世界上所没有的东西。文艺作品可以写正面人物和新社会，也可以写反面人物和旧社会，而且，没有旧社会就难以衬托出新社会，没有反面人物也难以衬托出正面人物。因此，关于题材问题的清规戒律，只会把文艺工作窒息，使公式主义和低级趣味发展起来，是有害无益的。至于艺术特征问题，典型创造问题等，应该由文艺工作者自由讨论，可以容许各种不同的见解，并在自由讨论中逐渐达到一致。
    文艺界已经有了戏剧方面实行“百花齐放，推陈出新”的经验。这是很宝贵的经验。现在的问题是把“百花齐放”的政策推行到一切文学艺术部门去。
      （三）在哲学和社会科学领域中，工作成绩是大的。但正因为如此，宗派主义的危险也就大了。如果不及时注意，可能发生思想僵化的严重后果。建国以来，在广大知识分子中宣传马克思列宁主义，进行思想改造运动，进行反对资产阶级唯心主义的斗争和肃清暗藏的反革命分子等工作，都是对的，必要的，而且有成绩的。但是，还应该看到阴暗面。有一些党员，产生了把哲学和社会科学的学术工作垄断起来的思想，自以为是，看不见甚至忘记了别人的长处，看不见别人的进步，听不得批评的意见，自己永远以先生自居，把别人看做是永远只配当自己的学生，看做永远只能是个唯心主义者或资产阶级学者。这就非常危险了。这样下去，个人就有堕落的危险，哲学和社会科学的事业就会死气沉沉，停滞不前。这些同志应该赶快停止陶醉，放谦虚些，多听些别人的批评，多做些学问，多向党外人士请教，同他们好好合作，以免哲学和社会科学的事业受到损失。
    鉴于建国以来已经将要七年，虽然还有一些人坚持唯心主义的思想，坚持资产阶级的思想，但是，很多人已经有了很大进步。应该考虑在哲学和社会科学的研究工作和教育工作中，依照情况，逐步改组力量，改变有些原来是错误的和原来并不错误但现在已经过了时的制度和办法，以便动员一切积极因素，发展我国的哲学和社会科学事业。哲学和社会科学是极重要的科学部门，所以一定要把工作做好。
    这里要附带谈谈近代史问题。近代史是社会科学中极其重要的部门，但是近年来成绩不多。据说，大家在等待中共中央编出一本党史教科书来，然后根据党史教科书来写各种近代史。现在请你们不要等待了。中共中央不准备编党史教科书，只准备陆续出版党的大事记和文件汇编。我们的近代史学工作者，应当独立地研究近代史中的各种问题。在近代史的研究中，也应该采取百家争鸣的政策，不应该采取别的政策。
    去掉宗派主义，团结一切愿意合作或可能合作的人；去掉垄断想法，去掉过多的清规戒律，实行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策；不要专为自己为本部门本单位的利益打算，多多帮助别人，帮助别部门别单位；去掉骄傲自大，自以为是，实行谦虚谨慎，尊重别人。这样，就可以去掉我们过去团结中的缺点，大大地加强团结。
    我们希望党外的文艺家和科学家也来注意加强团结的问题。周恩来同志在“关于知识分子问题的报告”中有一段话，我要在这里复述一遍。
    “在一部分知识分子同我们党之间，还存在着某种隔膜。我们必须主动地努力消除这种隔膜。但是这种隔膜常常是从两方面来的：一方面是由于我们的同志没有去接近他们，了解他们；而另一方面，却是由于一部分知识分子对于社会主义采取了保留态度、甚至反对态度。在我们的企业、学校、机关里，在社会上，都还有这样的知识分子：他们在共产党和国民党之间、中国人民和帝国主义之间不分敌我；他们不满意党和人民政府的政策和措施，留恋资本主义甚至留恋封建主义；他们反对苏联，不愿意学习苏联；他们拒绝学习马克思列宁主义，并且诋毁马克思列宁主义；他们轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民，轻视劳动人民出身的干部，不愿意同工人农民和工农干部接近；他们不愿意看见新生力量的生长，认为进步分子是投机；他们不但常常在知识分子和党之间制造纠纷和对立，而且也在知识分子中间制造纠纷和对立；他们妄自尊大，自以为天下第一，不能够接受任何人的领导和任何人的批评；他们否认人民的利益、社会的利益，看一切问题都从个人的利益出发，合乎自己利益的就赞成，不合乎自己利益的就反对。当然，所有这些错误一应俱全的人，在现在的知识分子中是很少数；但是有上述一种或者几种错误的人，就不是很少数。不但落后分子，就是一部分中间分子，也常有以上所说的某一些错误观点。胸怀狭窄、高傲自大、看问题从个人的利益出发的毛病，在进步分子中也还不少。这样的知识分子如果不改变立场，即使我们努力同他们接近，他们同我们之间也还是会有隔膜的。”
    这就是说，为了加强团结，要求共产党员的努力，也要求非共产党员的努力。
    个人主义，门户之见，在文艺界科学界中也是存在的。新老科学工作者之间的隔膜，也是存在的。这些不好的东西都应该去掉。我们相信一定能够去掉的。只要共产党员做出榜样来，同非党员一起努力，问题的解决是会顺利的。
        三、批评问题和学习问题
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”，对批评工作来说，就是批评的自由和反批评的自由。
    现在的批评，有的令人害怕。如果不令人害怕，就又往往淡而无味。这个问题该怎样解决呢？
    批评有两种。一种是对敌人的批评，所谓“一棍子打死”的批评，或打击式的批评。另外一种是对好人的批评，这是善意的同志式的批评，是由团结出发，经过斗争，来达到团结的目的的。这种批评，必需顾全大局，采取多说道理，与人为善的态度，而不能用阿Q正传中假洋鬼子的“不准革命”的态度。
    不论前一种批评或后一种批评，都要依靠研究。不是看到一点就写，而是看了很多想了很多才写。
    有一种想法是错误的，就是认为批评一定是打击的。在延安时期有个反革命分子叫王实味，后来又有一个反革命分子叫胡风，他们是用“杂文”和别的形式来攻击党和人民政权的。对于这些反革命分子，报之以打击，当然是应该的。但如果在人民内部也用这种打击的办法，就是错误的了。
    对好人的批评，我想介绍四篇文章：1、毛泽东：改造我们的学习；2、毛泽东：整顿党的作风；3、毛泽东：反对党八股；4、人民日报：关于无产阶级专政的历史经验。前三篇，是对王明、博古两同志的批评，这两人在当时是犯了重大错误的同志；后一篇是对斯大林同志的批评，斯大林是既有大功劳，又有大错误，而功劳多于错误的同志。看了这些批评，就会知道，可以有这样的批评，既不是过火的打击，也不是不痛不痒，而能使很多人得益的批评。可以看的出，写这样的批评，是经过了怎样的刻苦研究工作。这种批评，正是我们所应该提倡的。
    攀登科学和艺术的高峰是很困难的工作。所以困难，因为这里只能实事求是，不能有一点调皮。我们应该给科学家和艺术家以充分的支持。凡是老老实实做工作的科学家和文艺家，在我们这个社会制度之下，是只应受到支持，不应受到打击的。独立思考，进行复杂的创造性的劳动，完全不犯错误是不可能的。第一，单是知识不足，有时就会使人作出错误的判断。第二，把本来是正确的东西夸张了，看得太绝对了，也会犯错误。列宁说过：“只要向前再多走一小步，——看来仿佛依然是向同一方向前进的一小步，——真理便会变成错误”。（“左”派幼稚病第十章）有一些人，对进步的事物很拥护，只是太性急了一些，因而犯了错误，常常是属于这种性质。第三，有些人犯的是唯心主义的错误，但是犯唯心主义的错误也并不是什么稀奇的事情，因为“人的认识并不是直线（也不是循着直线进行的），而是那无限地近似于螺旋形的曲线。这曲线的任何一个断片、截片、小片，都可以转化（片面地转化）为独立的、完整的直线，而这一直线（如果只看见树木而不看见森林）就会导引到泥坑，导引到僧侣主义（在那里统治阶级的阶级利益把它巩固起来）”。（列宁：黑格尔“逻辑学”一书摘要219页）在认识发展的过程中，思想的僵化，孤立地看问题（所谓“钻牛角尖”）和片面地看问题，都会引导到唯心主义的错误。
    好人犯错误的事是常有的。完全不犯错误的人在世界上是没有的。应该把这种错误同反革命的言论严格区别开来。对这种错误的批评只应该是与人为善的，只应该是平心静气来说道理的，只应该是顾全大局，从团结出发达到团结的目的的。对于犯了错误的人，应该积极帮助他改正错误。受到批评的人也根本不用害怕。
    错误是容易犯的，但是错误必须要改正得愈快愈好，坚持错误就会造成很大的损失。对被批评的人来说，真理是应该坚持的，别人批评得不对，可以表示不同的意见；但错误是应该改正的，别人批评得对，应该虚心接受。公开承认错误，揭露错误的原因，分析产生错误的环境，仔细讨论改正错误的方法，这对于一个政党来说，是郑重的党的标志，对于个人来说，也是实事求是的标志。犯了错误，接受批评，就是接受别人对自己的帮助，这对于自己，对于我国科学事业和文学艺术事业的发展是只会有好处，不会有什么坏处。
    学习方面，要继续在自愿的基础之上组织对马克思列宁主义的学习，同时，要广泛地学习知识，对古今中外，对朋友，对敌人，都要批判地学习。
    学习马克思列宁主义，在广大的知识分子中已经成为热潮，这是一种好现象。马克思列宁主义的科学理论，是人类的最高智慧，是放之四海而皆准的真理。从前有人以为，马克思列宁主义是不适用于中国的，这种说法已经完全破产了。没有马克思列宁主义的科学理论作为指导，我国的革命胜利是不能设想的，我国的各种建设，包括科学和文化的建设在内，要取得巨大的成就和迅速的发展，也是不可设想的。
    但是，在学习马克思列宁主义这个工作中，也有许多缺点和错误，主要的是教条主义的倾向。
    十五年前，即1941年五月，毛泽东同志写了“改造我们的学习”，后来，1942年二月，又写了“整顿党的作风”和“反对党八股”。这三篇文章，是延安整风运动的基本文件。延安整风运动，是反对主观主义，主要地反对教条主义的一个思想运动。这是五四运动以后我国一次最伟大的马克思主义思想运动。教条主义，在我国民主革命时期中几乎断送了我国的革命，它是马克思列宁主义的大敌。这个痛苦的经验我们要牢牢记住。我们还必须深深警惕：如果用教条主义的态度来研究学问，如果用教条主义的态度来领导文艺工作和科学研究工作，那是一定要失败的，因为这种态度是完全违反马克思列宁主义的实事求是的态度的。
    我愿意趁这个机会，向我们的文艺家、科学家，郑重介绍毛泽东同志的“改造我们的学习”、“整顿党的作风”、“反对党八股”三篇文章，和中共中央六届七中全会“关于若干历史问题的决议”。我希望每个文艺工作者和科学工作者，都把这几篇文件精读几遍，以便了解教条主义同马克思列宁主义的分别何在，为什么教条主义是马克思列宁主义的大敌，为什么必须坚决地同教条主义进行斗争。
    我们要广泛地学习知识。
    我国有很多的医学、农学、哲学、历史学、文学、戏剧、绘画、音乐等等的遗产，应该认真学习，批判地加以接受。这方面的工作不是做得太多，而是做得太少，不够认真，轻视民族遗产的思想还存在，在有些部门还是很严重。
    接受些什么遗产和怎样接受遗产呢？
    如果要从现在的观点看来十全十美的东西，才作为遗产来接受，那末，就没有什么东西可以接受的了。相反，如果无批判地接受文化遗产，这便成了“国粹主义”了。
    对我国的文化遗产，我们提议采取这样的方针：要细心地选择、保护和发展它的一切有益成分，同时要老老实实地批判它的错误和缺点。现在，我们的工作在两个方面都有缺点。对我国文化遗产中的有益成分，有粗心大意一笔抹煞的倾向。这是当前主要的倾向。昆剧“十五贯”的演出，告诉了我们，那种认为昆剧里没有有益成分的说法是错误的。戏剧如此，其他文艺部门和科学研究部门是否也有类似的现象呢？应该说是有的。这种现象是应该改正的。同时，我们也发现了对文化遗产的缺点错误不加批判，或者加以粉饰的现象，这不是老老实实的态度，所以也是应该改正的。
    文艺工作者和科学工作者，要向人民去学习。人民的智慧是无穷无尽的，人民中间有很多宝藏还没有被发现，或者发现了还没有好好利用。举医学为例来说，从前，针灸、气功疗法等都是被看不起的，现在才被看得起了。可是，像正骨、推拿、草药等民间的医疗方法，现在还没有引起足够的重视和注意。再举音乐和绘画为例来说，这两个部门对民族遗产是不够重视的。凡是有这种情况的，都应该改正过来。从民间来的东西，常常是不系统化的，没有从理论上加以说明的朴素的东西，有的还带着所谓“江湖气”，带着迷信的色彩等等。这是不足为奇的。科学工作者和文艺工作者的任务，不是去鄙视这些东西，而是要去学习，细心选择、保护和发展它们的有益成分，使之成为科学的东西。
    我们要有民族自尊心，我们决不能做民族虚无主义者。我们反对所谓“全盘西化”的错误主张。但这决不是说我们应该自大，拒绝学习外国的好东西。我国还是一个很落后的国家，我们要花很大的努力向外国学习许多东西，我们的国家才能富强。民族自大，无论在什么情况下都是不对的。
    我们应该向苏联学习，向人民民主国家学习，向世界各国人民学习。
    向苏联学习，这是正确的口号。我们已经学了一些，今后还有许多应当学习。苏联是世界上第一个社会主义国家，世界和平民主阵营的领袖，它的工业发展速度最快，对社会主义建设有丰富的经验，在科学方面也已经有不少重要部门赶上和超过了最先进的资本主义国家。这样的国家，这样的人民，当然值得我们好好学习。不向苏联学习，是根本错误的。
    但是，在学习苏联的时候，我们的学习方法必须不是教条主义的机械搬运，而是要结合我国的实际情况。这一点必须引起注意。否则，也会使我们的工作受到损失。
    除了向苏联学习以外，还要向各人民民主国家学习。各人民民主国家，都有自己的长处，许多国家在工业和科学技术方面比我国进步，也有些国家在其他方面比我国进步，这些都是值得学习的。自高自大是不应该的。
    苏联和人民民主国家以外的世界各国的人民，他们是在不同的社会制度和国家制度之下。社会制度国家制度会有变化，但人民却会永远生存和发展下去。他们所以能够生存和发展，都不是没有原因的。凡是他们的长处，不论属于文艺科学的，属于风俗习惯的，或者属于其他种类的，我们都应该批判地加以学习。这里也不应该自高自大。
    除了朋友之外，我们也要向敌人学习，不是学习他们的反动的制度，而是学习他们的管理方法和科学技术中的有价值的东西。这种学习，目的是加速我国的社会主义建设的发展，以便更有力量来防止侵略和保卫世界和亚洲的和平。
    还要说一说党员应该向非党员学习知识的问题。我们不少党员是在知识上有缺陷的。非党员缺少马列主义的基本知识，但对于许多热心学习马克思列宁主义的非党员的朋友来说，那是过去的事或者将要过去的事了。他们之中很多的人已经把这个缺陷补足了，或者将要补足了。这个问题已经提出了，也已经在解决之中了。现在要提出的问题，是党员应该注意补足自己的缺陷了。办法只有老老实实向懂得的人去请教，去学习。非党员的知识分子，绝大部分学习得很努力。共产党员向他们学习各种知识的时候，不应落后。这也是学习问题里的重要的一条。
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”这个政策提出来之后，有许多问题会逐步跟着提出来，要求解决。希望大家考虑这方面的问题。今天只讲些原则问题，请大家加以指正。
