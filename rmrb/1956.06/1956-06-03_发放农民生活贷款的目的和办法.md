The State Council has decided that the State Bank will allocate 200 million yuan in temporary adjustment funds as living loans for farmers. Some readers have written to ask about the issuance of these loans, and the following is a comprehensive response.

The state issues living loans for three reasons. First, although most areas had a good harvest last year, a few areas still suffered natural disasters to varying degrees. Some farmers in these areas have some difficulties in their livelihoods in the spring. Second, in the vast non-disaster areas, some farmers (mainly poor peasants, including some lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants) lack the necessary living expenses in the spring and summer due to their weak financial foundations. Third, after farmers join agricultural cooperatives, they cannot arbitrarily go out to do odd jobs or temporary work. The agricultural cooperatives do not have much experience in organizing agricultural and sideline production, and some cooperatives have not organized sideline production well enough. As a result, many farmers have encountered some temporary difficulties in their livelihoods due to the reduction of sideline income. In order to help farmers solve these difficulties, in addition to the part of the living loans that the National Bank and credit cooperatives have already issued, the National Bank will allocate another 200 million yuan in temporary adjustment funds for distribution by local authorities.

The principle of allocating these loans is: more should be allocated to areas that suffered disasters last year, areas that are economically poor, and cooperatives with more poor peasant members; less can be allocated to non-disaster areas, areas that are not economically poor, and cooperatives with fewer poor peasant members. The targets of the loans are mainly agricultural cooperative members who have livelihood difficulties, especially poor members; however, a small number of non-cooperative farmers can also apply to the National Bank or credit cooperatives for loans if they do have livelihood difficulties. The amount each agricultural cooperative should receive should be specifically assessed by the local Party and government leading organs in conjunction with the bank or credit cooperative; the amount each member should receive should be democratically assessed by the agricultural cooperative; as for farmers outside the cooperative, the amount should be specifically determined by the rural credit cooperative or bank institution under the leadership of the local Party and government organs. When determining the loan amount, the degree of farmers' livelihood difficulties should be the main basis, and simple average distribution methods should not be adopted.

The specific method for issuing loans is: in areas with credit cooperatives, the National Bank will first lend to the credit cooperative, and then the credit cooperative will issue loans to agricultural cooperatives or farmers; in areas where there are currently no credit cooperatives, the National Bank will directly issue loans. When issuing loans, the agricultural cooperative can uniformly borrow and organize sideline production to solve the livelihood problems of its members; the agricultural cooperative can also first borrow and then distribute the loans to individual members according to the degree of their livelihood difficulties; or, after democratic evaluation by the agricultural cooperative, members can directly borrow from the credit cooperative or bank. Banks and credit cooperatives should strive to simplify procedures and facilitate the masses as much as possible in handling the issuance of loans.

The interest rate for living loans is 5.1 per mille per month when the bank lends to the credit cooperative; when the credit cooperative lends to the agricultural cooperative or farmers, the interest rate is 7.2 per mille per month. The term of this loan is six to eight months, and it is generally required to be recovered after the autumn harvest. Local authorities can adjust this according to the local agricultural production season.

    发放农民生活贷款的目的和办法
    国务院决定：由国家银行拨出两亿元临时调剂资金作为农民生活贷款。有些读者来信对这项贷款的发放工作提出了一些问题，现在综合答复如下。
    国家发放生活贷款有三个原因。第一，去年虽然多数地区丰收，但是少数地区仍然遭受了不同程度的自然灾害，这些地区的一部分农民在春季生活上有一定的困难。第二，在广大非灾地区，也有一部分农民（主要是贫农，也包括一些新、老中农中间的下中农）由于家底薄弱，在春夏青黄不接时期，缺乏必要的生活费用。第三，农民加入农业社后，不能任意出外打短工、做零活，而农业社组织农、副业生产的经验还不多，有些社对副业生产就组织得还不够好；因此，不少农民由于副业收入减少了，生活出现了一些暂时的困难。国家为了帮助农民解决这些困难，除了原来国家银行、信用社已经发放的一部分生活贷款之外，再由国家银行拨出两亿元临时调剂资金，交由各地掌握发放。
    这项贷款的分配原则是：去年受灾地区、经济上比较贫困地区和贫农社员较多的社，应该多分配些；非灾地区、经济上不太贫困的地区和贫农社员不太多的社，可以少分配些。贷款的对象主要是生活上有困难的农业社社员，特别是贫困社员；但是少数未入社的农民，如果生活上确实有困难，也可以向国家银行或信用社提出贷款申请。每一个农业社应该得到多少，应该由当地党、政领导机关会同银行或信用社来具体评定；每一个社员应该得到多少，应该由农业社进行民主评定；至于社外农民，则由乡信用社或银行机构在当地党、政机关领导下来具体确定。在确定贷款数字的时候，应该以农民的生活困难程度作为主要依据，切不可以采取简单的平均分配办法。
    发放贷款的具体办法是：在有信用社的地方，先由国家银行贷给信用社，再由信用社对农业社或农民进行发放；在目前还没有信用社的地方，则由国家银行直接进行发放。在发放的时候，可以由农业社统一承贷，统一组织副业生产以解决社员生活问题；也可以由农业社先行承贷后，再按照社员生活困难大小，分配给社员个人；或者经过农业社进行民主评议，由社员直接向信用社或银行承贷。银行和信用社在办理发放贷款的工作中应该力求简化手续，尽量方便群众。
    生活贷款的利率，银行贷给信用社时月息五厘一；信用社贷给农业社或农民时，月息七厘二。这项贷款的期限是六个月到八个月，一般要求秋收后收回，各地可以根据当地农业生产季节掌握。
