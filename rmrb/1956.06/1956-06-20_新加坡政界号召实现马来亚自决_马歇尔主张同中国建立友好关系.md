Xinhua News Agency, June 19th dispatch from Singapore: Singapore People's Action Party Chairman Toh Chin Chye said on June 15th that Malaya should have the right to self-determination. Any matter concerning Malaya should be decided by a democratically elected government itself, free from any external influence.

    Liberal Socialist Party Secretary Chen Yixu also issued a statement on the same day saying that the independence we are striving for should include democracy, freedom, and national characteristics, because this is human dignity. He said that once we gain independence, we should develop friendly relations with our neighbors, so that we in Asia can become one of Asia's allies.

    Singapore People's Action Party Legislative Assembly member Lim Chin Siong issued a statement on June 16th calling for the elimination of colonialist influence and striving to achieve an independent, free, democratic, unified, and peaceful Malaya. The statement said that in order to achieve this, it is extremely important to unite all patriotic parties and individuals, unify all anti-colonial forces, and externally unite all anti-colonial countries.

    Lim Chin Siong's statement also said that Malaya needs a good-neighborly foreign policy so that an independent Malaya will not be used by the Western bloc as a military base to threaten the peace and security of neighboring countries.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 19th dispatch from Singapore: Singapore Labour Front Chairman David Marshall said on June 16th that although China practices a communist system, she is still a great country in Asia, and the people of Singapore must establish friendly relations with China.

    He also said: My visit to China does not mean that I have changed my anti-communist stance. I still trust the democratic system, but that does not mean that I am an enemy of all countries with different political systems.

    马歇尔主张同中国建立友好关系
    新华社19日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡人民行动党主席杜进才六月十五日说：马来亚应该有自决的权利。任何有关马来亚的事情都应该由民选政府自己决定，不受任何外来势力的影响。
    自由社会党书记陈翼枢在同一天也发表谈话说，我们争取的独立应该包含民主、自由和民族性的内容，因为这是人类的尊严。他说，一旦我们获得了独立，我们就应该同我们的邻国发生亲善的关系，使我们在亚洲成为亚洲的盟友之一。
    新加坡人民行动党立法议员林清祥在六月十六日发表一项声明，要求摆脱殖民主义者的影响，争取实现一个独立、自由、民主、统一、和平的马来亚。声明说，要做到这一点，团结一切爱国政党与个人、统一一切反殖民主义力量以及对外联合一切反殖民主义的国家，是极端重要的。
    林清祥的声明还说，马来亚需要一个善邻的外交政策，使独立后的马来亚不致被西方集团利用为威胁邻国和平和安全的军事基地。
    据新华社19日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡劳工阵线主席马歇尔在六月十六日说：中国虽然实行共产主义制度，但她仍然是亚洲的一个伟大国家，新加坡人民必须同中国建立亲善友好的关系。
    他又说：我要访问中国并不是说已经改变了我的反共立场，我现在仍然信任民主制度，但是这不等于说，我是一切不同政治制度国家的敌人。
