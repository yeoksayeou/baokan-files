    The Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Circles in the Midst of the Socialist Transformation Upsurge
    -- Speech by Representative Bi Mingqi
    I fully agree with and support the three reports: "On the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," "On the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," and "The Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." All of this demonstrates that our country's socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds, one victory after another, which is truly exhilarating! Now, please allow me to give a brief report to the representatives on the situation of the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin in this great socialist transformation upsurge.
    Over the past few years since liberation, private industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin have, under the correct leadership and cultivation of the Party and the government, improved their ideological understanding to varying degrees. Many have actively accepted socialist transformation on the basis of patriotism and law-abidingness. In particular, after hearing Chairman Mao's earnest teachings to the industrial and commercial circles last November, everyone received profound education and great encouragement, recognized their future, and understood how to control their own destiny. They actively applied for overall public-private partnership, requesting further transformation. In a short period of time, with the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, a high tide of overall industrial and commercial transformation was formed. On January 14th of this year, all industrial and commercial sectors in the city achieved overall public-private partnership. This great victory of socialist transformation, which has international and historical significance, is, as Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out in his speech: it is unprecedented to adopt such a peaceful method to make the national industrial and commercial circles so happily accept this change.
    Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, Tianjin's joint venture work adopted the methods of first joint venturing and then reorganizing, first clearing assets and then verifying capital; all original private personnel were taken over completely, from top to bottom, arranged level by level. At the same time, the organizational strength of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association was fully utilized, and the role of key members of the industrial and commercial circles was brought into play. Therefore, in the joint venture work, the positive emotions of the masses were greatly consolidated, and basically, joint venture and production and management were not hindered.
    In the work of clearing assets and verifying capital, the government gave the industrial and commercial circles great trust, uniformly adopting the method of self-investigation, self-counting, self-evaluation, and self-reporting. The industrial and commercial circles formed a transformation work team of more than 3,000 people to actively assist the government and guide private industrial and commercial enterprises in their work. The families of industrial and commercial personnel also organized themselves to cooperate in this work. With the help of worker comrades, this complex and arduous task of clearing assets and verifying capital was completed in a very short time, and basically achieved the requirements of fairness, reasonableness, and being realistic.
    In terms of personnel arrangements, because the government implemented the central government's policy of "take them all over and give them appropriate work" and the principle of "use talents according to their ability and give appropriate consideration," and fully exchanged views and consulted with the heads of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association, private personnel were all given appropriate arrangements. Currently, among the private personnel in office, those who have been arranged to hold leadership positions at all levels, including managers and deputy managers of state-owned companies, managers and deputy assistant managers of specialized companies, directors and deputy directors of joint management offices, directors and deputy directors of general factories and branch factories, managers and deputy managers of urban and district general stores, and positions such as section and unit chiefs at all levels, already number 2,063. The rest remain in their original positions. Private personnel generally express gratitude and excitement about their arrangements.
    In terms of salary and benefits, because the government implemented the central government's policy of maintaining original salaries, most private personnel have maintained their original standard of living and their lives have been stabilized. In terms of welfare benefits, for issues such as the treatment of private personnel in terms of birth, aging, illness, death, work-related injuries and disabilities, and the issuance of wages during sick leave, the local government has also formulated solutions, that is, to solve them appropriately with reference to the situation of workers, and has begun to implement them in many units.
    After the overall joint venture, due to the changes in production relations, the working relationships between cadres, workers, and private personnel in the enterprise have also undergone significant changes. Because the Party, the government, and the trade union have vigorously carried out education on the policy of peaceful transformation for cadres and workers, and a work system has been initially established in the joint venture enterprises, the general cadres and workers have done a relatively correct and serious job in uniting and educating private personnel. Most private personnel are able to obey the political leadership of public representatives and are active and responsible in their work. Therefore, the working relationships between cadres, workers, and private personnel in general joint venture enterprises are relatively normal, and it is indeed possible to enable these private personnel to achieve "have position and power."
    With the establishment of the overall joint venture organization, the arrangement of personnel and production tasks, the Party and the government timely, organized, and led the socialist labor competition in the city's joint venture enterprises. At present, more than 70% of the employees in the city's joint venture enterprises (including private personnel) have participated in this movement. Due to the changes in the nature of the enterprise after the overall joint venture and the further development of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, industry and commerce have shown an unprecedented new atmosphere in production and management. The output and quality of many industrial products have been significantly improved, the sales volume of commerce has generally increased, and the service attitude has also greatly improved. Through the competition, many private employees have received practical education and realized that "participating in the competition is a good opportunity to further transform themselves," thus, under the leadership and help of worker comrades, they have played their active role and made significant progress in publicizing technology, promoting advanced experience, displaying technical talents, creating new products, improving tools and equipment, improving management style, and improving service quality. In the first quarter of this year, when enterprises and units were evaluating advanced deeds, many private personnel were selected as advanced producers and advanced workers along with worker comrades. As of the end of May, 256 private personnel have won the glorious title of advanced producer or advanced worker. In addition, more than 280 people have received commendations and material rewards. These vivid examples fully demonstrate that the policy of peaceful transformation implemented by the Party and the government is incomparably correct, and also shows that as long as our private industrialists and businessmen sincerely and actively accept socialist transformation, we will further receive the love and encouragement of the Party and the people, and our future is exceptionally bright and broad.
    In the high tide of transformation, private industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin have also undergone significant changes in their thinking. In the overall joint venture, most people were able to see the future clearly, were jubilant, and actively accepted socialist transformation. After the joint venture, because their work was properly arranged and their lives were guaranteed, they further realized that the policy of peaceful transformation implemented by the Party and the government was incomparably correct. Therefore, not only did the progressive elements of the past perform more actively, but the phenomenon of middle elements turning to progress was also very prominent. Even those who were relatively backward in the past, in the high tide of transformation, due to the great call of the Party and the practical education of socialism, many people's thinking has also undergone great changes. The number of progressive elements has increased significantly compared with before the joint venture, and this trend of gradually turning to progress is still continuing to develop. This is a gratifying thing that meets the needs of the people. Therefore, it can be said that the active acceptance of transformation and the initiative to seek progress are the mainstream of thought among private industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin.
    The problem is that there is still a considerable proportion of middle elements who, on the one hand, have insufficient study and unclear understanding of the policies, and on the other hand, also have shortcomings in the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and insufficient help for them. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to strengthen education for them and help them make progress in the future. As for the antagonistic emotions and the phenomenon of passive resignation and irresponsibility that exist among general backward elements towards socialist transformation, we must also vigorously help, lead, and educate them to actively study, improve their understanding, and strive to move forward. The illegal acts and bad habits of a few people who re-commit theft of enterprise public funds, deliberately increase expenditures, use inferior goods to replace good ones, and short-weight, as well as the even worse individual elements who still provoke discord or retaliate against worker comrades, should be given serious attention. Although these people account for a very small number in the industrial and commercial circles, they are playing a certain degree of obstruction and sabotage in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction. Therefore, it is also necessary to conduct education and necessary struggles according to different situations, and strive for them to actively correct their shortcomings and mistakes and accept transformation.
    This situation also shows that the ideological transformation of private personnel in the current joint venture enterprises is still far behind the transformation of the enterprises. Therefore, many people deeply feel their ideological emptiness and lack of knowledge, and urgently demand learning. At the same time, the Party has also promptly grasped the leadership and planning of the study of the industrial and commercial circles, and under the unified leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Learning Committee of the industrial and commercial circles, mainly composed of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association, was established to promote various types of on-the-job learning. At present, Tianjin has gradually launched five types of regular regular learning: (1) The Municipal-level Marxist-Leninist Spare-time School for Industrial and Commercial Circles was established to study political economy; (2) Each specialized company organized some private personnel in joint venture enterprises to participate in cadre theory study; (3) Each district established a Spare-time Political School for Industrial and Commercial Circles to study policies and elementary theoretical knowledge; (4) Each district organized popular education on current affairs policies for the vast number of industrial and commercial circles; (5) Each district organized cultural learning for people with little culture and illiteracy. In addition, the government also organized short-term rotational off-the-job learning for private personnel. At present, more than 30,000 people have participated in various types of on-the-job learning, and more than 1,000 people have participated in off-the-job learning. In general, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in Tianjin has been relatively smooth and the situation is generally normal due to the correct implementation of the central government's policies. However, in this great and extensive change, it is impossible to require that all problems be arranged very appropriately at once. Therefore, there are still some problems, which are also inevitable. According to the recent understanding, the current problems in Tianjin's transformation work are mainly that the working relationships within enterprises (including the relationship between public and private and the relationship between workers and private personnel) are still not normal enough; some private personnel still have difficulties in their lives, and the arrangements for small traders and peddlers are not timely enough; and general industrialists and businessmen are demanding that the method of "fixed interest" be determined as soon as possible. Before the opening of this conference, I originally prepared to raise these issues at the conference and ask the government to resolve them as soon as possible. After listening to Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech the day before yesterday, all the problems I wanted to raise were resolved, which shows that the Party and the government have long attached importance to these problems and have actively tried to solve them. Therefore, it is hoped that governments at all levels will quickly and thoroughly implement the spirit and specific measures of Vice Premier Chen Yun's instructions, especially for the difficulties in the lives of private employees, and it is hoped that they can be resolved in a timely manner. When implementing these policies, organizations such as the Federation of Industry and Commerce have the responsibility to actively assist, and at the same time, private employees must strengthen their study, strive to transform their thinking, and actively keep up with the pace, so that these problems can be resolved better.
    In addition, I would like to put forward some immature opinions on several specific issues in the future transformation of private industry and commerce:
    1. Vice Premier Li Xiannian encouraged the small contributions made by private industrialists and businessmen in the past few years since liberation in his report, which made us feel honored and excited. I think that the reason why we can make these small contributions is inseparable from the correct leadership and cultivation of the Party and the government. In the future, we must make greater efforts to make more contributions to the cause of socialist construction in the motherland. Therefore, it is hoped that the Party and the government will further strengthen leadership and education for us so that we can transform ourselves better and faster.
    2. The quality of the relationship between public and private in the joint venture enterprise directly affects the production and operation of the enterprise. Therefore, doing a good job in the enterprise's working relationship is one of the important tasks at present. I believe that in the future, in the joint venture enterprises, when public representatives implement the policy of uniting and educating private personnel, they should be open and honest in their work and daily contact, promptly encourage the good performance of private personnel, and also put forward criticisms and corrections to incorrect thoughts and wrong behaviors in a positive way, and should point out the direction and methods to private personnel as specifically and deeply as possible, so that they can effectively help private personnel improve their ideological understanding and make progress. If they are tolerant and do not talk about things, it is easy for private personnel to speculate arbitrarily, affect their emotions, and feel uneasy at work. At the same time, private personnel should take the initiative to rely on the Party and the working masses, sincerely accept leadership, learn to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, humbly accept opinions, regularly conduct self-examination, overcome inferiority and complacency, and gradually establish socialist ideology, so that they can gradually change the views of worker comrades and truly achieve the goal of unity and transformation. As for the key members of the industrial and commercial circles, they should first strengthen their own study, break capitalism, establish socialism, strive to learn the noble qualities of selfless labor and selflessness and the style of hard work and simplicity of the working class, play an exemplary role everywhere, resolutely oppose the individualistic ideological style of being alone and detached from the masses or attacking others to show themselves, and do not let their thinking fall behind the masses. On this point, I am willing to work together with the comrades in the industrial and commercial circles to correct our shortcomings and do our job well.
    3. Key members of the industrial and commercial circles who often participate in social activities generally have the problem of how to properly balance social activities and enterprise work, which even forms an ideological burden. Although some people have explored some experience in this issue, it cannot completely solve the problem. According to my personal opinion, on the one hand, the key members themselves should make proper arrangements in combination with the specific situation of their social activities and enterprise work, but more importantly, they must obtain strong support and assistance from all relevant parties. Therefore, it is recommended that the government clarify the necessity of key members of the industrial and commercial circles participating in social activities and the consistency of doing a good job in enterprise work, and properly arrange the division of labor for these key members according to their different conditions.
    Representatives, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party, our motherland is like the rising sun, radiating light. The happy and beautiful socialist society is just around the corner. Although the current in-depth transformation is only just beginning, we have full confidence and determination that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and completely transform ourselves into self-reliant working citizens. We must always listen to Chairman Mao and follow the Chinese Communist Party!

    在改造高潮中的天津市工商业界
    ——毕鸣岐代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算”、“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”和“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”等三个报告。这一切都说明了我国的社会主义建设事业正在一个胜利跟着一个胜利地大踏步前进，真是使人感到万分的兴奋！现在，请允许我把天津市工商业界在这一个伟大的社会主义改造高潮中的情况向各位代表做一个简单的汇报。
    天津市的私营工商业者，解放几年来，在党和政府正确领导和培养教育下，思想认识都有了不同程度的提高，不少的人在爱国守法的基础上积极接受社会主义改造。特别是在去年十一月听到了毛主席对工商业界的谆谆教导，使大家受到了深刻的教育和极大的鼓舞，认清了前途，懂得了如何掌握自己的命运，纷纷申请全行业公私合营，要求进一步接受改造。在很短时间内，就随着农业合作化高潮的到来，形成了私营工商业全行业改造的高潮，今年1月14日全市工商行业全部实现了公私合营。这种具有国际意义和历史意义的社会主义改造的伟大胜利，正如陈云副总理在发言中指出的：采用这样一种和平方法使全国工商界如此兴高采烈地来接受这种改变，这是史无前例的第一次。
    天津市的合营工作，在党和政府的正确领导下，采取了先合营后改组，先清产后核资；对原有的私方人员全部包下来，先上后下，逐级安排的办法。同时还充分地运用了工商联、民建会的组织力量，发挥了工商界骨干分子的作用。因此，在合营工作中，大大地巩固了群众的积极情绪，基本上做到了合营与生产经营两不误。
    在清产核资工作中，政府给予工商界以极大的信任，一律采取自查、自点、自估、自报的办法，并由工商界组成了3，000多人的改造工作队，积极协助政府和辅导私营工商业进行工作，工商界家属也组织起来配合了这一工作。在职工同志的帮助下，在很短时间内就完成了清产核资这一复杂繁重的任务。且基本上达到了公平合理，实事求是的要求。
    在人事安排方面，由于政府贯彻了“包下来，给以适当工作”的方针及“量才使用，适当照顾”的原则，并和工商联、民建会的负责人充分交换了意见，进行了协商，使私方人员都得到了适当的安排，目前对私方在职人员安排担任各级领导职务的，其中包括国营公司经副理、专业公司经副襄理、合营管理处正副主任、总厂和分厂正副厂长、市区总店经副理、各级科股长等职位，已经有2，063人，其余均原职不动。一般私方人员对自己的安排普遍表示感激和兴奋。
    在薪金待遇方面，由于政府贯彻了中央指示的原薪不动的方针，大部分私方人员都保持了原来的生活水平，生活得到稳定，在福利待遇方面，对于私方人员的生、老、病、死和因公伤残、死亡及疾病等待遇，以及病假期间的工资发放等问题，也都由地方政府拟定了解决的办法，即参照职工的情况酌情解决，在许多单位已开始执行。
    全业合营后，由于生产关系的变化，企业中的干部，职工和私方人员相互间的工作关系，也随着有了显著的变化，由于党、政府和工会对干部、职工大力进行了和平改造政策的教育，并且合营企业里初步建立了工作制度，一般干部、职工在团结教育私方人员方面，都做得比较正确、认真，大多数私方人员也都能够服从公方人员在政治上的领导，工作积极负责，因而在一般的合营企业内，干部、职工、私方人员相互之间的工作关系比较正常，确能使这些私方人员做到“有职有权”。
    随着全业合营机构的建立，人事安排和生产任务的安排以后，党和政府及时地有组织、有领导的，在全市合营企业内开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。目前全市合营企业中有70％以上的从业人员（包括私方人员在内）都参加了这一运动。由于全业合营后，企业性质发生了变化和群众的积极性、创造性进一步的发挥，使得工商业在生产经营上，出现了前所未有的新气象，许多工业产品的产量质量有了显著的提高，商业的销货额普遍增加，服务态度也有了很大的改进。私方从业人员通过竞赛，好多人受到了现实教育，体会到“参加竞赛是进一步改造自己的好机会”，从而在职工同志的带动和帮助下发挥了他们的积极作用，在公开技术，推广先进经验，发挥技术才能，创造新产品，改进工具设备，改善经营作风，提高服务质量各方面都有了显著的表现。在本年第一季度各企业单位评比先进事迹时，不少的私方人员得与职工同志一道被评选为先进生产者和先进工作者，截至五月底，私方人员获得先进生产者或先进工作者光荣称号的有256人，此外，还有280多人得到了表扬和物质奖励，这些生动的事例，充分体现了党和政府执行的和平改造政策是无比的正确，同时也说明了我们私营工商业者只要是诚恳的、积极地接受社会主义改造，就会进一步得到党和人民对我们的爱护和鼓励，我们的前途是异常光明广阔的。
    在改造高潮中，天津市的私营工商业者在思想上也有了显著的变化，全业合营中，多数人能够看清前途，欢欣鼓舞兴高采烈的积极接受社会主义改造，合营后，由于工作得到了适当安排，生活有了保障，进一步体会到党和政府执行的和平改造政策无比正确，因而不仅过去的进步分子表现得更加积极了，中间分子转向进步的现象也很突出，就是过去比较落后的人在改造高潮中，由于受到党的伟大感召和社会主义的现实教育，不少人思想上也发生了很大的变化，进步分子较合营前显著增加，并且这种逐步转向进步方面的趋势，仍在继续发展着。这是符合人民要求的一件可喜的事情。因此说，天津市的私营工商业者，积极接受改造，主动要求进步，是目前思想上的主流。
    问题是目前还有一部分比重相当大的中间分子，一方面由于他们学习不够，对政策认识不清，另一方面也由于工商联的工作存在缺点，对他们帮助不够，所以今后尚须继续对他们加强教育，帮助他们进步。至于对一般落后分子所存在的对社会主义改造的抵触情绪和消极躺倒不负责任的现象，更须要我们大力帮助，带动和教育他们积极学习，提高认识，努力前进。对少数人所发生的重犯盗窃企业公款、故意加大开支、以次顶好、短斤少秤等违法行为和陋规恶习，以及那些更恶劣的个别分子仍对职工同志进行挑拨离间或打击报复等行为，更应引起严重注意。这些人虽然在工商界中占极少数，但是他们在社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业中，是起着一定程度的阻碍和破坏作用的。因此，也要分别不同的情况，进行教育和必要的斗争，争取他们积极的改正缺点和错误，接受改造。
    这一情况同时也说明了目前合营企业私方人员的思想改造，仍然是远远落后于企业的改造。因此好多人深深感到自己思想上的空虚和知识的贫乏，迫切要求学习。同时党对工商界的学习也及时地抓紧了领导与规划，在政协天津市委员会的统一领导下，以工商联和民建为主的成立了工商界学习委员会，推动各类在职学习。目前天津市已逐步开展了五种经常性的正规学习：（1）在市一级成立了工商界马列主义业余学校，学习政治经济学；（2）各专业公司组织合营企业中部分私方人员参加了干部理论学习；（3）各区成立了工商界业余政治学校，学习政策和初级理论知识；（4）对广大工商界，各区组织了时事政策的普及教育；（5）对文化浅和文盲的人，由各区组织了文化学习。此外，政府方面还组织了私方人员进行短期轮训的离职学习。目前参加各类在职学习的已经有三万多人，参加离职学习的也有千人以上。总起来说：天津市对私营工商业的社会主义改造工作，由于正确执行了中央的政策，进行得比较顺利，情况一般是正常的。但是在这一个伟大而广泛的变革中，一切问题不可能要求一下子都安排得很恰当。因此，还有一些问题存在着，这也是不可避免的。根据最近了解的情况，天津市改造工作中目前存在的问题，主要是企业内部的工作关系（包括公私关系和职工与私方人员的关系）有的还不够正常；部分私方人员的生活还有困难，小商小贩的安排还不够及时；以及一般工商业者都要求早日确定“定息”的办法等等问题。在这次大会召开之前，我原来准备把这些问题在大会上提出来，请政府尽快解决。前天听了陈云副总理的发言后，所有我想提出的问题，都获得了解决，这说明了党和政府早已重视了这些问题，并已积极设法加以解决。因此，希望各级政府把陈云副总理指示的精神和具体办法赶快深入地贯彻下去，特别是对那些私方从业人员生活上存在的困难问题，更希望能够及时加以解决。在贯彻这些政策时，工商联等组织有责任积极进行协助，同时私方从业人员也必须加强学习，努力改造思想，积极跟上前去，才能使这些问题解决得更好。
    除此，我个人对今后私营工商业改造工作中的几个具体问题提出一些不成熟的意见：
    1．李先念副总理在报告中对私营工商业者解放后几年来所做的微小贡献曾加以鼓励，使我们感到光荣和兴奋，我认为所以能有这些微小的贡献，是与党和政府的正确领导和培养教育分不开的。今后我们一定要尽更大的努力，在祖国的社会主义建设事业中做出更多的贡献，因此，希望党和政府对我们进一步加强领导和教育，使我们能够更好更快地进行改造。
    2．合营企业内部公私关系的好坏，直接影响到企业的生产经营。因此，搞好企业的工作关系是当前的重要工作之一。我认为今后在合营企业中，公方代表对私方人员贯彻团结教育政策时，在工作和日常接触中要开诚相见，对私方人员好的表现要及时加以鼓励，对不正确的思想和错误行为也要正面提出批评纠正，并应尽可能具体深入的指给私方人员以方向和办法，这样才能有效的帮助私方人员提高思想认识得到进步。如果优容照顾，涵蓄不谈，反易使私方人员妄加揣测，影响情绪，工作不安。同时，私方人员更应主动依靠党和工人群众，诚恳接受领导，学会使用批评与自我批评的武器，虚心接受意见，经常进行自我检查，克服自卑和骄傲自满的情绪，逐步树立社会主义思想，这样才能逐渐改变工人同志的观感，真正达到团结和改造的目的。至于工商界的骨干分子，更应该首先加强本身的学习，破资本主义，立社会主义，努力学习工人阶级忘我劳动和大公无私的高贵品质和艰苦朴素的作风，处处起模范带头作用，坚决反对独善其身脱离群众或是打击别人，显示自己的个人主义思想作风，不要使自己的思想落在群众的后面。关于这一点，我愿意和工商界的同志们共同努力，改正缺点，把工作作好。
    3．经常参加社会活动的工商界骨干分子，目前普遍存在着对社会活动与企业工作如何妥善兼顾的问题，严重的甚至形成思想负担。虽然有些人在这个问题上摸索到了一些经验，但是还不能完全解决问题，根据个人的看法，一方面骨干分子本身应结合个人的社会活动与企业工作的具体情况进行妥善的安排，但是更重要的是要取得各有关方面的大力支持和帮助。因此，建议政府明确工商界骨干分子参加社会活动的必要性和搞好企业工作的一致性，并对这些骨干分子根据他们不同条件，妥善安排分工。
    各位代表：我们的祖国在党的英明正确领导下，正像旭日东升，光芒万丈，幸福美好的社会主义社会就在眼前，目前深入的改造虽然还仅在开始，但是我们有充分的信心和决心，一定能够克服一切困难，把我们自己完全改造成为一个自食其力的劳动公民。我们要永远听毛主席的话，跟着中国共产党走！
