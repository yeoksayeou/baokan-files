    Miracles North and South of the Tianshan Mountains
    Deng Tuo
    The Tianshan Mountains, north and south, boast beautiful scenery,
    The road connects the long-lasting friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
    Remote frontiers are transformed into a new world;
    Barren wildernesses suddenly sprout great factories.
    Astonishing miracles are commonly seen;
    The land is full of inexhaustible treasures.
    Seize this youthful time to strive diligently,
    Oases everywhere are our homelands.

    During the blooming spring in Central Asia and both the northern and southern sides of the Tianshan Mountains, I visited Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union, and then returned to Xinjiang in our country. The above poem was written after my return to Xinjiang. The heroic labor of the great builders of socialism and communism in China and the Soviet Union deeply moved me. Thanks to their efforts, the area north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, which borders the two countries, has already begun to see miracles, and even more and greater miracles will appear in the future.

    In ancient times, transportation in this bordering region of China and the Soviet Union was difficult and intermittent. The records of the traffic routes north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Chinese historical documents are not yet precise enough and should be further investigated; however, based on the records since the Han Dynasty, the main routes by which the ancients traveled from mainland China to the Western Regions were no more than three. Of these, only the northern route passed through the Tianshan Mountains, while the middle and southern routes passed through the Pamir Plateau. Moreover, the northern route was interrupted for several hundred years from the Tang Dynasty to the Yuan Dynasty. Therefore, for a long period in the past, the friendship between the various ethnic groups here was limited by historical conditions and had no opportunity to develop. Only under completely new historical conditions did the greatest friendship between China and the Soviet Union arise, and this friendship is growing day by day.

    Now, the border between the Soviet Kazakh Republic and Xinjiang in our country is more than 1,500 kilometers long. On one side are the edges of the four states of East Kazakhstan, Almaty, Semipalatinsk, and Taldy-Kurgan, and on the other side are the edges of the three regions of Tacheng, Yili, and Aksu. Many branches of the Tianshan Mountains are distributed overlappingly in this area. In the past few years, although there have been air routes, highways, and waterways between the two countries in this region, these are completely unable to meet the needs. The capacity of air transport is very limited, needless to say. In the middle from Almaty State to Taldy-Kurgan State, there is a highway that winds around the high mountains for more than 60 kilometers and can lead to Xinjiang in our country. It is said that this is one of the difficult ancient traffic routes, and it is still not an ideal highway today. The Ili River flows from Xinjiang in our country into the Soviet Union, passes through the Dzhungar Alatau steppe, and flows into Lake Balkhash. Soviet ships can only sail upstream to Xinjiang during the high-water season in summer and autumn, and their carrying capacity is also very limited. What is gratifying is that the Turkestan-Siberia Railway passes through southeastern Kazakhstan near the Chinese border. There is a small station here that has never been noticed by people, but is now world-famous. It is Aktogay. On April 7 this year, the governments of China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement in Beijing to build a railway from Aktogay to Xinjiang in our country, connecting with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. This is another symbol of the greatest friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Comrade Yakovlev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Kazakh Communist Party, told me that the railway line from Aktogay to the Chinese Xinjiang border has been surveyed, and the station on the border has been named "Friendship."

    Today in the Soviet Union, many young students and technical workers, many engineers and scientists, voluntarily signed up to participate in the construction of this railway. Everyone hopes that this new friendship road between China and the Soviet Union can be completed as soon as possible, so that the Tianshan area can be more closely connected; so that the high mountains and grasslands of this area can be made to obey the will of the people, and the natural material strength can be taken out and dedicated to the great cause of socialist and communist construction.

    For the great cause of socialism and communism, the construction speed in the Tianshan area is very astonishing. Whether it is in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, or Xinjiang in our country, I have seen many new construction sites; large numbers of young people are building new and beautiful homelands in the oases. At the same time, people are also opening up new oases in the vast wilderness.

    When I arrived in Yili, Xinjiang, I met many Kazakh youths who were discussing the construction plan of the Yili region. They expressed their determination to build Yili into the largest center of agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry in northern Xinjiang.

    Yili is a Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in the north of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. This is a very beautiful oasis. Yining City, which has a population of nearly 100,000, can be said to be a completely green city. Almost all the streets are lined with willow trees, and most people's courtyards also have fruit trees and lilacs. The construction of this city is being carried out according to a new plan. More than half of the residents of the prefecture are Kazakhs, and there are also Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Russians, Xibe, Tajiks, Tatars, Hui, Han, Mongolians, Tibetans, Manchus, Daur, Turkmen, Salar, Dongxiang, Afghans, Koreans, Germans, and a total of twenty ethnic groups. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, people of all ethnic groups are united unprecedentedly to build new homes and new societies. They want to develop the rich mineral deposits in this area, expand the agricultural irrigation area, and improve the economy of the grassland pastoral area.

    In Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, people will be amazed and amazed from the bottom of their hearts when they see the rapid progress of urban and industrial construction. There are thirteen ethnic groups here. Before liberation, the population was less than 80,000, but now the city's population has increased to 150,000. Everywhere are newly built high-rise buildings, and even the once desolate suburbs have now become new urban areas. In the past, there was no industry here at all, but now it is increasingly becoming a huge industrial city. Many barren lands near the city have become fertile fields. I visited the Huoxing Collective Farm in Huangshicao Township, and at that time they had just finished planting more than 12,000 mu of land in the spring. A female production team leader, a Uyghur woman named Hatam, said to me: "There will be a great harvest this year, and life will be better than in previous years."

    I have also seen that the area north of the Tianshan Mountains, which has always been called the "hungry grassland," is now full of prosperity. This so-called "hungry grassland," which is within the territory of the Uzbek Republic of the Soviet Union, has been reclaimed for more than 200,000 hectares. Many state farms and collective farms have been established. New houses assembled from ready-made components are appearing everywhere on the grassland, and many new villages have been formed in this way. In order to flush the alkalinity in the soil and carry out irrigation, a central canal has been opened on the grassland, branching out into many branch canals. Along both sides of the canals there are also many sluice gates, so that each state farm and collective farm can draw water for irrigation. The so-called "hungry grassland" is no longer hungry today.

    In Kazakhstan, even more wasteland has been reclaimed. Most of them are in the north and east, and some are in the south. At present, of the 27 million hectares of land that have been sown, 18 million hectares are newly reclaimed land. 337 newly established state farms. After the autumn harvest this year, these farms will be able to repay all the investment to the state. They themselves did not expect such good results.

    Originally, many people doubted the future of agricultural development in these areas, because this area has always been known for its drought. Where can we find water? Countless people in ancient times have been stumped by this problem. However, this problem cannot stump the people who are building socialism and communism.

    Water sources should be very abundant in the Tianshan area. The Tianshan Mountains, which are covered with snow all year round, produce countless streams from each of its valleys, which gush towards its northern and southern regions all year round. This is one of the inexhaustible sources of water.

    The people of the newly built Kaskelen State Farm in Almaty State were able to cultivate more than 30,000 hectares of land on 80,000 hectares of land in less than a year. In addition to various conditions, it is because they know how to discover and utilize water sources. Originally, this large area of ​​wasteland was very short of water, but when farm manager Koshley first came to choose the land, he believed that water could be diverted from the Kaskelen River for irrigation. Now the farm's irrigation canal system is quite sound, and the central area is all irrigated land. They also want to find new water sources and expand the irrigated area.

    I would like to especially introduce the water conservancy of Big Almaty Lake. This lake is on the top of a mountain 2,500 meters above sea level, 40 kilometers away from Almaty City. The lake area is one square kilometer, and the water storage capacity is 8.5 million cubic meters. It is remotely opposite to "Heavenly Pool" near Urumqi, Xinjiang, in the south of Tianshan. Now the water conservancy of Big Almaty Lake has been fully utilized, and its running water is used for power stations, tap water, and irrigation canals. Walking up the mountain to the lakeside, looking at the surrounding snow and floating white clouds, I thought that the "Heavenly Pool" in Xinjiang should also be fully utilized. Some people say that "Heavenly Pool" is not easy to use, but I think this is a wrong statement. There may be similar hydropower resources in the Tianshan Mountains that can be used but have not been used, and should be further discovered.

    Similarly, the underground water resources in the Tianshan area are also inexhaustible, as long as people know how to discover it.

    In order to explore the underground water resources in this area, I noticed some very interesting phenomena along the way. On a large grassland through which the Dzhungar Alatau Highway passes, once we rested halfway, many people got out of the car and caught a dozen turtles from the roadside. The farther away from the highway, the more turtles there were. People only need to walk a few steps and flick the shallow grass with their toes to see large and small turtles crawling there. The turtles are green because they eat grass; the size is almost the same as ordinary dinner plates. It is said that the largest one can hardly be held by one person. I think there must be a lot of water underground with so many turtles on the grassland. Sure enough, not too far away, passing a small village called Qingjite, there is a clear spring flowing from the edge of the village. When I stopped to ask the residents, they said that the spring source is six kilometers away from the village, and it does not dry up all year round; there are several other similar spring sources nearby.

    Academician Satpayev, President of the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences, told me that the survey in the southern Altai Mountains and the northern Tianshan Mountains proves that the water resources in this area are very abundant. There is water in some places as soon as you dig, and even a fountain appears. There is also water in some places even if you dig below 800 meters. He also estimated that there may also be large underground water resources in Xinjiang, China.

    The situation in Xinjiang is indeed as he said. I visited the large farm reclaimed by the Xinjiang troops on the banks of the Manas River, and the facts proved that there are many underground water sources in this area. The person in charge of the production troops told me that 500 underground water sources have been discovered in an area of ​​140 kilometers north-south and 20 kilometers east-west. I surveyed a few places, and spring water sprayed up from the ground, some converging into a small lake, some flowing out of several small rivers, surrounded by reeds and ferns. If you are not careful when walking, there is a risk of falling into a mud pit. If we can make full use of these many abundant underground water sources, it will not only benefit agricultural reclamation, but also change the climate and natural scenery. The so-called Jiangnan outside the Great Wall is nothing strange. In the past, wasn't the area of ​​the Manas Farm considered "barren land"? But now it has become a new world. A new city of 12 square kilometers has been built here, with a population of 35,000. I saw the same situation in several places in Xinjiang, and I couldn't help but feel very happy.

    People living in the Tianshan area, whether they are Soviets or Chinese, or people of any ethnic group, almost all have the same proverb: "Where there is water, there is life." Now people should add another sentence: There can be water everywhere, and there can be life everywhere.

    Of course, people not only need to have life, but also strive to make all life grow up in happiness.

    In order to create a happy life, people are developing rich resources in the Tianshan area. Academician Satpayev, President of the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences, said that almost all the rare metals known to people in the world can be found in Kazakhstan. Based on the introduction of the Kazakhstan resource survey he did, I firmly believe this statement. The results of geological exploration in Xinjiang, China, also clearly prove that the mineral resources buried underground are the same in many parts of southern and northern Tianshan. Therefore, many barren mountains and wildernesses that were once uninhabited have now formed or are forming huge industrial and mining areas.

    Modern industry requires a large amount of fuel, and this region happens to have extremely rich fuel to ensure a full supply. For example, coal. Kazakhstan has the largest coal-producing area in the Soviet Union, with many extremely thick coal seams, excellent coal quality, and large-area open-pit coal mines. These coal fields pass through the Tianshan Mountains and extend to Xinjiang in our country. Urumqi is a coal field with huge reserves. For example, oil. A lot of oil has been discovered in Soviet Kazakhstan, and it is still being discovered. The situation in Xinjiang in our country is also similar. The recently announced Karamay Oilfield is an example. In the words of Academician Satpayev, the Tianshan Mountains—this mountain range, which is still young in geological time—has not yet ended its growth phase. The material strength it contains is endless, as long as people are good at discovering and using it. Therefore, there is reason to believe that if it can get the support of sufficient economic and technical strength, then countless amazing miracles will surely appear in the Tianshan area, and the most amazing and huge miracles will be waiting for us in the future.

    天山南北的奇迹
    邓拓
    天山南北好风光，
    路接中苏友谊长。
    绝塞翻成新世界；
    荒原骤起大工场。
    惊人奇迹寻常见；
    满地浑金无尽藏。
    趁此青春多努力，
    绿洲到处是家乡。
    在中亚细亚和天山南北春光烂漫、花红柳绿的时候，我访问了苏联的乌兹别克斯坦和哈萨克斯坦，然后回到我国的新疆。上面的一首律诗就是我回到新疆以后写的。中苏两国的社会主义和共产主义的伟大建设者们的英雄式劳动，使我受到极大的感动。由于他们的努力，中苏两国毗连的天山南北地区，在目前已经开始出现了奇迹，今后还会出现更多更大的奇迹。
    中苏两国的这个接壤地区，古代交通困难，时断时续。我国历史文献中关于天山南北交通路线的记载还不够确切，应该进一步加以考察；但是综合汉代以来的记载，古人由中国本部到西域各国去，主要的不外经过三条路线。其中只有北路才经过天山，至于中路和南路都是经过帕米尔高原。而且北路从唐代到元代也曾中断了几百年。因此，在过去长久的时期中，这里各民族人民之间的友谊受了历史条件的限制，没有发展的机会。只有在完全新的历史条件下，中苏两国才产生了最伟大的友谊，并且这种友谊才日益发展。
    现在苏联的哈萨克共和国同我国新疆相连的国境线有一千五百公里以上。这里一方面是东哈萨克斯坦、阿拉木图、舍米帕拉金斯卡、塔尔达库尔干斯基四个州的边缘，一方面是塔城、伊犁、阿克苏三个地方的边缘。天山山脉的许多支脉重叠分布在这一带地面上。几年来两国在这个地区虽然有航空线和公路、水路的交通，但是这些完全不能满足需要。航空运输的能力很有限是不用说的。从阿拉木图州到塔尔达库尔干斯基州的中间，有一条公路盘旋高山六十多公里，可以通到我国的新疆。据说，这是古代艰难的交通路线之一，现在仍然不是理想的公路。伊犁河从我国的新疆流入苏联，经过德热尔根士克草原，注入巴尔喀什湖。苏联的轮船只能在夏秋水涨的时候才可以溯流驶到新疆，而且载重也很有限。令人高兴的是土尔克斯坦——西伯利亚铁路就从哈萨克斯坦东南部接近中国边境的地方通过。这里有一个小车站，它从来不为人们所注意，而现在却闻名世界了。它就是阿克斗卡。今年四月七日，中苏两国政府在北京签订了协定，将修建一条铁路，从阿克斗卡到我国新疆，同兰新铁路接轨。这是中苏两国最伟大的友谊的又一标志。哈萨克共产党中央委员会书记雅科甫列夫同志告诉我，从阿克斗卡到中国新疆边界的铁路线已经勘测好了，并且把国境线上的车站命名为“友谊”。
    今天在苏联，有许多青年学生和技术工人，许多工程师和科学家，自愿地报名，要求参加这条铁路的建设工作。所有的人都希望中苏两国的这个新的友谊道路能够早日完成，使天山南北地区更加紧密地连接在一起；让这一带的高山和草原服从人们的意志，把天然的物质力量拿出来，献给社会主义和共产主义建设的伟大事业。
    为了社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业，天山南北地区的建设速度是十分惊人的。无论是在乌兹别克斯坦，在哈萨克斯坦，或者是在我国新疆等地，我都看见了许多新的建筑工地；大批青年人在绿洲上建设着新的美丽的家乡。同时，人们也正在广漠的荒野上开拓新的绿洲。
    当我到达新疆伊犁的时候，我遇见许多哈萨克族的青年正在谈论伊犁区的建设规划。他们表示决心把伊犁建设成为北疆的农业、畜牧业和工业的最大中心地区。
    伊犁是新疆维吾尔自治区北部的一个哈萨克自治州。这是一个非常美丽的绿洲。现有近十万人口的伊宁市更可以说是完全绿化的城市。所有街道的两旁几乎都是杨柳树，大多数人家的院子里还有果树和丁香。这个城市的建设正在按照新的计划进行。全州居民有半数以上是哈萨克族，此外还有维吾尔、柯尔克孜、乌孜别克、俄罗斯、锡伯、塔吉克、塔塔尔、回、汉、蒙古、藏、满、达呼尔、土库曼、撒拉、东乡、阿富汗、朝鲜、日耳曼等共二十个民族。现在各族人民在共产党的领导下，空前地团结一致，建设新的家乡和新的社会。他们要开发这个地区的丰富矿藏，要扩大农业灌溉区，要改善草原畜牧区的经济。
    在新疆维吾尔自治区的首府乌鲁木齐，看到城市和工业建设进展的迅速，人们更会不自禁地由内心发出惊奇的赞叹。这里有十三个民族，解放前居民不足八万，现在全市人口已经增加到十五万了。到处是新建的高楼大厦，就连过去一片荒凉的郊外，现在也成了新的市区。过去这里根本没有工业，现在却日益成为巨大的工业城市。近城的许多荒地已经成了良田。我访问了黄水槽乡的火星集体农庄，当时他们刚刚结束了一万二千多亩地的春季播种。一个女生产队长维吾尔族的妇女哈潭姆对我说：“今年准有一个大丰收，生活比往年更要好。”
    我也曾看见在天山山脉以北历来被人叫做“饥饿的草原”上，现在充满着欣欣向荣的景象。这个所谓“饥饿的草原”在苏联的乌兹别克共和国境内的部分，已经被开垦了二十多万公顷。许多国营农场和集体农庄建立起来了。用现成的构件装配的新房子在草原上到处出现，许多新的村落就这样形成了。为了冲洗土壤中的碱性和进行灌溉，草原上开辟了中央水渠，分出许多支渠。沿着渠道的两旁还有许多闸口，以便各个国营农场和集体农庄都能够引水灌溉。所谓“饥饿的草原”如今再也不饥饿了。
    在哈萨克斯坦，新开垦的荒地更要多得多。它们大部分是在北部和东部，南部也有一些。目前在二千七百万公顷播种了的土地中，有一千八百万公顷是开垦的新地。新建立的国营农场有337个。今年秋收以后，这些农场就可以把全部投资偿还给国家。这样好的成绩连他们自己也没有预料到。
    本来有许多人怀疑这些地区农业发展的前途，因为这个地区历来都以干旱闻名。到哪里去找水呢？古来有无数的人被这个问题所难倒。然而，这个问题却不能难倒在建设社会主义和共产主义的人们。
    在天山南北，水源应该是非常丰富的。终年积雪的天山，从它的每个山谷里产生无数溪流，长年不停地向它的南北地区奔泻，这是无穷尽的水源之一。
    阿拉木图州新建的卡斯克连斯基国营农场的人们，能够用不满一年的时间，在八万公顷土地上垦种了三万多公顷。这除了种种条件以外，就因为他们懂得发现和利用水源。本来这一大片荒地非常缺水，但是，场长柯什雷最初来选择地段的时候，就认为可以从卡斯克连斯基河里引水灌溉。现在农场的灌溉渠道系统已经相当健全了，中心地带都是水浇地，他们还要寻找新的水源，扩大灌溉面积。
    我要特别介绍一下大阿拉木图湖的水利。这个湖在拔海二千五百公尺的山顶上，离阿拉木图城四十公里。湖面是一平方公里，容水量是八百五十万立方公尺。它和天山南面的我国新疆乌鲁木齐附近的“天池”遥遥相对。现在大阿拉木图湖的水利已经充分发挥出来了，它的流水供给发电站、自来水、灌溉渠三方面的使用。上山走到湖边，看看四周的积雪和浮动的白云，我想起新疆的“天池”也应该加以充分利用。有的人说“天池”不好利用，我认为这是错误的说法。天山山脉中类似这样可以利用而未利用的水力资源恐怕还有，应该进一步去发现。
    同样，天山南北地区的地下水源也是无穷尽的，只要人们会发现它。
    为了探究这一带的地下水源，我沿途注意到一些很有趣的现象。在德热尔根士克公路通过的一个大草原上，有一次在半路休息，许多人走下汽车，从路边捉到十来个乌龟。离开公路走得远一点的地方，乌龟就更多。人们只要走几步，用脚尖在浅草丛中拨弄一下，就可以看到大龟小龟在那里爬行。龟身发绿，因为吃草的原故；大小同普通的西餐盘子差不多。据说最大的几乎一个人还抱它不拢。我想草原上有这么多乌龟，地下必定多水。果然，走不太远，过一个小村，名叫青吉特，有一道清泉从村边流出。停车询问居民，据说泉源离村六公里，终年不干；附近还有同样的泉源好几处。
    哈萨克共和国科学院院长萨特帕耶夫院士告诉我，在阿尔泰山南部和天山北部的勘测证明，这一带的水源是很丰富的。有的地方一挖就有水，甚至出现喷泉，有的挖到八百公尺以下也有水。他并且估计我国新疆可能也有很大的地下水源。
    新疆的情形果然像他所说的那样。我参观了新疆部队在玛纳斯河边开垦的大农场，事实证明这一带地下水源是很多的。生产部队的负责人对我说，在南北一百四十公里、东西二十公里的一片地区内，已经发现的地下水源有五百处。我踏看了几处，泉水都从地下喷上来，有的汇成一个小湖，有的流出几条小河，周围长满了苇草和蕨薇，走路稍不小心，就有陷入泥坑的危险。对于这许多丰富的地下水源，我们如果能够加以充分的利用，不但有益于农垦事业，而且可以改变气候和自然景色。所谓塞外的江南并不是什么稀奇的事情。过去这个玛纳斯农场一带何尝不是被认为
  “不毛之地”呢？可是现在却变成了一个新的世界。在这里建设了十二平方公里的新城市，拥有三万五千人口。我在新疆看到好几个地方都有同样的情形，不由人不感到万分的高兴。
    生活在天山南北地区的人们，无论是苏联人或是中国人，也无论是那一个民族的人，几乎都流传着相同的一句谚语——“那里有水，那里就有生命。”现在人们还应该补充一句说：到处可以有水，到处可以有生命。
    当然，人们不只是要有生命，而且要努力使一切生命在幸福中成长。
    为了创造幸福的生活，人们在天山南北开发着丰富的资源。哈萨克共和国科学院院长萨特帕耶夫院士说，世界上人们已经知道的一切稀有的金属几乎都可以在哈萨克斯坦找到。根据他所做的哈萨克资源勘测的情况介绍，我确切地相信这个论断。我国新疆的地质勘探结果也清楚地证明，地下蕴藏的矿产资源在天山南部和在天山北部有很多是相同的。因此，有许多过去绝无人烟的荒山和原野，现时已经形成或者正在形成巨大的工矿地区。
    现代的工业需要大量的燃料，这个地区恰好又有极丰富的燃料可以保证充分的供应。比如煤炭，在哈萨克斯坦就有全苏联最大的产煤区，有许多煤层极厚、煤质极好、大面积的露天煤田。这些煤田从天山底下透过，一直伸到我国新疆，乌鲁木齐就是一个蕴藏量巨大的煤田。又比如石油，在苏联的哈萨克斯坦已经发现了不少，还在继续发现；在我国的新疆情形也正相仿，最近宣布的克拉玛依油田就是一个例子。用萨特帕耶夫院士的话来说，天山——这个在地质年代上还算是年青的山脉，至今并没有结束它的生长阶段；它所蕴藏的物质力量是无穷尽的，只要人们善于发现和利用它。因此，有理由相信，如果能够得到充分的经济和技术力量的支援，那末，天山南北地区就一定会有无数惊人的奇迹出现，而且最足以惊人的巨大奇迹将要在未来的日子里等候着我们。
