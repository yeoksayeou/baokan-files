Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Rapeseed procurement work is being universally carried out in rapeseed producing areas across the country. At present, in the major producing areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, etc., large quantities of rapeseed are entering the market, and the procurement quantities are increasing daily. In Zhejiang Province alone, in the five days from May 26th to 30th, over 7.4 million jin were procured, an increase of about two and a half times compared to the previous five days. According to incomplete statistics from the China Oils and Fats Company, by late May, the quantity of rapeseed procured in various regions reached over 340 million jin, an increase of more than 10% compared to the procurement volume in the same period last year.

In the procurement work, the oil and fat companies and grain departments in various regions have signed pre-purchase contracts with agricultural producers' cooperatives according to the policy of "more production, more gain; increased production, more retention". In order to take care of the farmers' needs for cake fertilizer, Sichuan, Zhejiang and other provinces have also adopted the method of signing contracts for selling seeds and returning cakes. In some areas where fields are being prepared and rice seedlings are being transplanted, many mobile purchasing stations have appeared, making it convenient for farmers to sell rapeseed.

According to the problems existing in the current procurement, the China Oils and Fats Company issued instructions to its affiliated companies in various regions, requiring them to strengthen the publicity work on the policies and methods for procuring oilseeds; at the same time, they should organize local oil presses to process for the farmers, and carry out the work of exchanging materials for oil.

    各地油菜子收购数量逐日增加
    新华社10日讯　全国油菜产区普遍展开了油菜子收购工作。目前，在四川、贵州、云南、江西、浙江、湖北等主要产区，油菜子大量上市，收购数量逐日增加。浙江省仅五月二十六日到三十日的五天中，就收购了七百四十多万斤，比前五天增加了二倍半左右。据中国油脂公司不完全统计，到五月下旬，各地收购的油菜子数量达三亿四千多万斤，比去年同期收购量增加10％以上。
    各地油脂公司和粮食部门在收购工作中，根据“多产多得，增产多留”的政策，同农业生产合作社签订了预购合同。四川、浙江等省为了照顾农民对饼肥的需要，还采取了签订售子退饼合同的办法。有些正在整田插秧的地区，出现了很多巡回流动收购站，便利农民出售菜子。
    中国油脂公司根据目前收购中存在的问题，向各地所属公司发出指示，要求加强关于收购油料的政策、办法的宣传工作；同时组织好土榨油坊替农民加工，并且开展以料换油的工作。
