    A Neglected Problem
    Yun Feng
    Guangdong Province has basically achieved agricultural collectivization, with only a few percent of farmers remaining outside the cooperatives.

    Who are these farmers outside the cooperatives? According to a survey by the Qingyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a significant portion of them are wealthy farmers unwilling to join the cooperatives. Besides, there are also impoverished farmers lacking labor or means of production, widowers, orphans, the disabled, and farmers expelled from the cooperatives.

    A large portion of these non-cooperative farmers face many difficulties in production and life. The Qingyuan County Committee of the CCP and other local Party committees understand that the production of non-cooperative households generally lags behind the farming season. Many of them lack labor and production materials such as oxen, seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools. Some have not even sown seeds yet. A recent report from the Zhanjiang District Production Command states that in Dawukeng Village, Nongsheng Township, Maoming County, the rice transplanting work of fifteen non-cooperative households is progressing very slowly. In Fengwu Village of the same township, fifteen non-cooperative households, lacking drought-resistant tools, abandoned agricultural production during the spring plowing season and went up the mountains to cut firewood for sale.

    This problem is very serious. However, many local Party organizations and cadres have not given it the attention it deserves. Two excuses prevent people from caring for non-cooperative farmers. One is: the non-cooperative households are only a few percent, their role is insignificant, and it doesn't matter whether we take care of them or not; the other is: we can't even manage the agricultural production cooperatives properly, how can we possibly take care of individual households? Under the influence of this thinking, some cooperatives not only fail to help non-cooperative households solve their production and living difficulties but also adopt attitudes of exclusion and discrimination. For example, in Dapi Township, Sankeng District, Qingyuan County, two impoverished non-cooperative farmers recently encountered many difficulties in production and repeatedly requested to join the cooperative, but the cooperative staff have been slow to accept them. In the same township, some farmers previously had certain ideological concerns, and cadres had repeatedly mobilized them to join the cooperative in the past, but they were unwilling, and were viewed by cadres and members as backward elements difficult to change. Currently, they are encountering many difficulties in production and want to join the cooperative, but they are afraid to openly propose it; the cadres are also indifferent to their difficulties. In the same township, some farmers had minor shortcomings in the past and were considered unqualified to join the cooperative and are still barred from the cooperative.

    Clearly, the cadres in these places have forgotten the cooperative's responsibility to warmly and without barriers unite and help non-cooperative farmers.

    Recently, through production inspections, some areas in Guangdong Province have discovered this problem, and some of them (such as Qingyuan County) have already begun to solve it. However, more places have not yet changed this situation of not caring about non-cooperative farmers. This situation should not continue.

    一个被疏忽了的问题 
    云风
    广东省已经基本上实现农业合作化，社外农民只剩下百分之几了。
    合作社以外的农民，多是些什么人呢？根据中共清远县委会的调查，其中有相当一部分是不愿意入社的富裕农民，此外就是缺乏劳动力或者缺乏生产资料的贫困农民、鳏寡孤独和疾病残废的人、被开除出社的农民等。
    这些社外农民中很大的一部分，在生产和生活上都有很多困难。中共清远县委会和其他地区的党委了解，社外农户的生产普遍赶不上生产季节。其中不少人缺乏劳动力，也缺乏耕牛、种子、肥料、农具等生产资料，有些人甚至到现在还没有播下种。湛江地委生产指挥部最近的材料中说，茂名县农胜乡大五坑村，十五户社外农户的插秧工作都进行得很迟缓。这个乡的冯屋村有十五户社外农户，因为缺乏抗旱工具，在春耕季节放下当前农业生产不管，上山去砍柴卖。
    这个问题是很严重的。但是，不少地区的党组织和干部，对于这个问题还没有给以应有的重视。有两个借口妨碍着人们去关怀社外农民。一是说：没入社的农户不过百分之几而已，这些人作用不大，管不管没关系；一是说：农业生产合作社都还管不了，那里能够再理单干户？在这种思想支配下，有些合作社不但不帮助社外农户解决生产上、生活上的困难，而且采取了排斥和歧视的态度。例如清远县三坑区大陂乡有二户社外贫困农民，最近生产上遇到不少困难，屡次要求入社，但是社的工作人员迟迟不接受他们。这个乡还有一些农民，以前思想上有某些顾虑，过去干部曾多次动员他们入社，他们不愿入社，被干部和社员看做很难改变的落后分子。目前他们在生产上遇到不少困难，想要入社，但是又不敢公开提出；干部对他们的困难也不闻不问。这个乡还有一些农民，以前有些小毛病，被认为不够入社条件，到现在仍然被拒于合作社的门外。
    很显然，这些地方的干部已经忘记合作社应当热情地、无隔阂地团结、帮助社外农民的责任了。
    最近，通过生产的检查，广东省有些地方已经发现这个问题了，其中有些地方（如清远县）已经着手解决这个问题。但是更多的地方直到现在还没有改变这种不关心社外农民的情况。这种情况不应当再继续下去了。
