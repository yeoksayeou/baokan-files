Xinhua News Agency, 19th -- Of the nineteen state-owned cotton textile factories that the Ministry of Textile Industry planned to construct during the First Five-Year Plan period, eleven have already been completed and put into production. The remaining four cotton textile factories, which are striving to be completed this year, are currently having equipment installed.

The construction blueprints for the last designed project—the Northwest Sixth Cotton Textile Factory—were sent to the construction site in early June. This factory, along with the Shijiazhuang Fourth Cotton Textile Factory, the Handan Fourth Cotton Textile Factory, and the Zhengzhou Fifth Cotton Textile Factory, were originally scheduled to begin construction next year and go into production the year after. Because the design was completed ahead of schedule, construction is now underway in full swing, and it is expected that the time these four factories go into production can be advanced by one year.

According to the design, the cotton cloth produced annually by these nineteen cotton textile factories can provide more than 240 million people with a new set of clothes each.

    五年计划期间要兴建的十九个棉纺织厂建成十一个
    新华社19日讯　纺织工业部计划在第一个五年计划期间建设的十九个国营棉纺织厂，到目前已经有十一个厂建成并投入生产。争取在今年内建成的另四个棉纺织厂，正在安装设备。
    最后设计的一项工程——西北第六棉纺织厂工程的施工图纸，在六月上旬送往工地。这个厂和石家庄第四棉纺织厂、邯郸第四棉纺织厂、郑州第五棉纺织厂，都原订明年施工，后年投入生产。由于设计提前完成，目前已在紧张施工，预计这四个厂投入生产的时间能提早一年。
    按照设计，这十九个棉纺织厂每年生产的棉布，可供两亿四千多万人各做一套新衣。
