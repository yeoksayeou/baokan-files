Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, 5th. At 9:03 AM on the 5th, four Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter planes intruded into the airspace over Shantou and Jinghai areas of Guangdong Province. One of them was shot down by the People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units with fierce artillery fire. The downed Chiang Kai-shek plane crashed into the sea three to four kilometers southwest of Nan'ao Island.

Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, 6th. Xinhua News Agency reporters Wang Man and Zhu Su reported on the scene of our army shooting down a Chiang Kai-shek plane in Shantou on the 5th: On the morning of June 5th, the sky over Shantou was clear after the rain, dotted with white clouds. At 9:03 AM, four Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter planes, taking advantage of the cloud cover, intruded into the Shantou area.

The anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Shantou area rapidly prepared to strike the invading Chiang Kai-shek planes. On the position, the young gunners immediately skillfully rotated the gun barrels, correcting the elevation and direction. In an instant, the Chiang Kai-shek planes entered the firing range. The commander of our army's anti-aircraft artillery position quickly ordered: "Rapid fire!" Immediately, thunderous artillery fire sounded on the position, and white puffs of smoke appeared around the Chiang Kai-shek planes. At that moment, a shell hit the fuselage of the leading Chiang Kai-shek plane. The plane somersaulted three times in the air, crashed into the sea southwest of Nan'ao Island in a burst of smoke and fire. The people watching nearby cheered and applauded: "The PLA comrades shot accurately!"

The remaining three Chiang Kai-shek planes, under the interception of our army's fierce artillery fire, fled in panic.

    汕头我军击落蒋机一架
    新华社汕头5日电　五日九时三分，蒋军F—84型战斗机四架窜扰广东省汕头、靖海地区上空，被中国人民解放军高射炮兵部队以猛烈炮火击落其中一架。被击落的蒋机坠入南澳岛西南三公里到四公里之间的海里。
    新华社汕头6日电　新华社记者王曼、朱苏报道汕头我军五日打落蒋机一架的情景说：六月五日早晨，雨后初晴的汕头上空挂着朵朵白云。九时三分，蒋军F——84型战斗机四架借着云层的掩护侵扰汕头地区。
    汕头地区中国人民解放军某高射炮兵部队急速准备着打击来犯的蒋机。阵地上，年青的炮手们立刻熟练地转动着炮身，校正高低方向。顷刻间，蒋机进入火力网。我军高射炮兵阵地上的指挥员迅速下令：“急速射击”。于是阵地上响起了雷鸣般的炮声，蒋机周围出现了一个个白色烟球。就在这一刹那，一颗炮弹打中排头的一架蒋机的机身。这架蒋机在半空中翻了三个筋斗，冒着一团烟火栽到南澳岛西南的海里去了。正在阵地附近观看的老百姓都鼓掌欢呼：“大军同志打得真准！”
    其余三架蒋机在我军猛烈炮火的截击下，仓惶逃去了。
