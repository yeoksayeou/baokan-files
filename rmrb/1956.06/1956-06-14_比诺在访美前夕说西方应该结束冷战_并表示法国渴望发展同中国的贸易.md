Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, Paris dispatch: A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said at a press conference on the evening of the 12th that French Foreign Minister Bidault would fly to the United States on the 14th for a seven-day visit.

On the same day as the announcement of Bidault's visit to the United States, Bidault delivered a speech in Paris. He said that the West should ultimately end the Cold War, try to reach an agreement on disarmament, and place its main forces on economic issues, especially on aid to underdeveloped countries. The West should also eliminate the perception that "countries that are not with us are against us."

Bidault said that France does not intend to abandon its alliance, but this does not mean that France cannot have contact with other countries. On the contrary, it should try to get its allies to also make such contacts.

When talking about trade issues, Bidault said that France is eager to develop trade with China because it cannot be the last to enter the Chinese market.

    比诺在访美前夕说西方应该结束冷战
    并表示法国渴望发展同中国的贸易
    新华社13日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部发言人十二日晚上在记者招待会上说，法国外交部长比诺将在十四日乘飞机到美国作为期七天的访问。
    在宣布比诺访美日程的同一天，比诺在巴黎发表演说。他说，西方最后应该结束冷战，设法就裁军问题达成协议，并且把主要力量放在经济问题上，特别是放在对落后国家的援助问题上。西方还应当消除这种看法：“凡是不和我们在一起的国家都是反对我们的”。
    比诺说，法国不打算放弃它的联盟，但是这并不等于说，法国不能同其他国家接触。恰恰相反，它应该设法使它的盟国也进行这种接触。
    比诺在谈到贸易问题的时候说，法国渴望发展同中国的贸易，因为它不能在最后才进入中国这个市场。
