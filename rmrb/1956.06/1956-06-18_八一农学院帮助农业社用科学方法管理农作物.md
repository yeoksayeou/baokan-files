Xinhua News Agency report: The teachers and graduating students of Xinjiang's August First Agricultural College are helping agricultural production cooperatives manage crops scientifically in conjunction with their production internships. After the seeds of crops such as potatoes and corn were treated with scientific methods with the help of teachers and students from the August First Agricultural College, they grew vigorously. Potato seedlings grew quickly and are estimated to mature earlier; corn treated with seed dressing is not only growing strongly but is also resistant to insect pests. Thanks to the Agricultural College's scientific methods of helping to kill red spiders, aphids, and other pests that occur during the growth of vegetable crops, the vegetables are also growing well.

In March of this year, the August First Agricultural College signed a production technology assistance contract with the Democratic Agricultural Cooperative and the Happiness Vegetable Cooperative in the suburbs of Urumqi. The teachers and students of the August First Agricultural College helped the agricultural cooperatives with spring plowing, sowing, and field management according to the contract. During the sowing period, the Agricultural College students trained sowing machine operators for the agricultural cooperatives and introduced them to the method of row sowing.

    八一农学院帮助农业社用科学方法管理农作物
    据新华社讯　新疆八一农学院的教师和一批今年应届毕业生，结合生产实习帮助农业生产合作社对农作物进行科学管理。由八一农学院师生帮助用科学办法处理了马铃薯、玉米等作物种子后，生长旺盛。马铃薯的苗长得很快，估计可以提早成熟；经过拌种的玉米不但禾苗茁壮，而且能抗御虫灾。由于农学院用科学办法帮助捕杀蔬菜作物生长期间发生的红蜘蛛、蚜虫等害虫，蔬菜也生长良好。
    今年3月间，八一农学院同乌鲁木齐郊区民主农业社和幸福蔬菜合作社订立了生产技术帮助合同。八一农学院师生根据合同帮助农业社进行了春耕播种和田间管理。在播种期间，农学院学生为农业社训练了播种机手，向他们介绍了条播的方法。
