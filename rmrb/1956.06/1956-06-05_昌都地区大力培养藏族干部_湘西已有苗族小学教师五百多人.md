    Qamdo Area Vigorously Trains Tibetan Cadres
    Xiangxi Already Has More Than 500 Miao Elementary School Teachers
    Xinhua News Agency: The Qamdo area will train 300 Tibetan cadres this year and send 800 young people to study at the Central and Southwest Nationalities Institute and the Tibetan Cadre School of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee. This is stipulated in the 1956 work plan adopted by the Fourth People's Representative Conference of the Qamdo area.
    At present, there are more than 440 Tibetan cadres working in various levels of government, enterprises, cultural and educational institutions, and medical and health departments, most of whom are children of farmers and herdsmen. They have all been trained since liberation. After several years of practical training and learning in their work, some have taken on leadership positions. 14% of these Tibetan cadres have become members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and members or probationary members of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Tibetan upper-class figures who have connections with the masses have also been widely absorbed into leading positions in the government. Tibetans account for more than 95% of the more than 400 members of the People's Liberation Committees at all levels. At this People's Representative Conference, twenty-nine of the three newly elected vice chairmen and eighteen members and the nine newly appointed directors and deputy directors are Tibetan. Headman training classes have also been held in various "zong," and 700 headmen have taken up grassroots government work below the "zong" level after their studies.
    In the past few years, the Qamdo area has also sent 300 Tibetan youths to study at the Central and Southwest Nationalities Institute and professional schools, and more than 100 students have graduated and returned to their jobs.
    Xinhua News Agency: The Xiangxi First Nationalities Normal School has trained another 38 Miao elementary school teachers for Miao children. Currently, this group of recent graduates from the simplified normal school is interning at nearby elementary schools. This year, the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture has more than 100 Miao students graduating from the simplified normal school.
    The leading organs of the autonomous prefecture have made many efforts to train Miao elementary school teachers over the years. According to statistics, there are more than 500 Miao elementary school teachers currently in service, most of whom have been trained since liberation.
