The Situation in the Nu River Region
— Speech by Representative Pei A-qian

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget. In that damned old society, the people only knew that officials forced them to hand over the money of ordinary people, and only saw officials taking it to line their own pockets! Now our people fully understand where the country's money comes from and where it is used. It is obvious to all that the money is used for socialist construction and for the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups. This is the embodiment of the people's democratic system.

From Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the reports of other leaders, from my work in the Nu River Lisu Autonomous Region (Prefecture) in Yunnan Province, and from what I saw on my journey from my hometown to Kunming, from Kunming to Beijing, from Beijing to Lhasa, and from Lhasa back to Beijing via Chengdu: I can see that the country's first Five-Year Plan is guaranteed to be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. The motherland's construction is advancing by leaps and bounds! A person living in the border mountain valleys of the motherland, a person who has experienced wind and frost and tasted all the bitterness of life, feels particularly refreshed and wants to hold his head high in the face of the motherland's rapid progress!

The construction achievements of all ethnic groups in the motherland encourage us to progress, and the Five-Year Plan guarantees our development in all aspects. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we must forge ahead with confidence and make steady progress:

First, we are prepared to transition directly to a socialist society through the path of mutual aid and cooperation.

The socio-economic situation in the Nu River region is very backward. Although there has been some differentiation between rich and poor and some exploitative relationships have emerged, the landlord economy and the rich peasant economy have not yet been developed. Individual farmers of various ethnic groups are engaged in scattered farming, planting a small piece of dry land in the east and a small hillside in the west. They don't know how to fertilize, they don't know how to cultivate carefully, and they just poke a hole with a stick and drop in corn seeds. Of course, they won't grow good crops. Coupled with frequent disasters such as wind, snow, hail, insects, beasts, and floods, "planting a gourd" doesn't even guarantee "harvesting a ladle," so life in the past was very poor. After liberation, especially after the general line was announced, agricultural production mutual aid organizations were widely established, and with the strong support of the government, many technical improvements were made: such as the gradual reduction of slash-and-burn cultivation, the increase of fixed cultivation and processing, digging ponds for planting corn, and applying fertilizer. Grain production has increased significantly. For example, in Manzi Village, the number of grain-deficient households decreased from 58% of the total households to 26%. In animal husbandry, the past practice of grazing in the wild, not managing and breeding carefully, and not actively preventing animals has been changed, and significant development has also been achieved. For example, in Ekeluo Township, 251 households originally had only 148 cattle and 215 pigs, but in less than two years, they increased to 220 cattle and 440 pigs. In the past, planting mountain goods, medicinal materials, and cash crops, a pound of Coptis chinensis could not be exchanged for a pound of salt, and the farmers were discouraged. Now the state purchases at reasonable prices, and everyone is active. This year, in addition to expanding the planting of existing crops such as Coptis chinensis and Gentiana macrophylla, they have also planted 41,000 tea trees and sown 600 jin of tea seeds. Agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and cash crops all have prospects for development, and farmers have already experienced the benefits of organizing: not only are there more people who have enough to eat, but their clothing has also improved. In Ekeluo Township, there were only three cotton quilts in the past, but now there are 150. Developing production can improve living standards!

The people of all ethnic groups clearly see that to fully utilize land power and natural conditions, to add large and new-style farm implements, to improve technology, and to resist natural disasters, it is impossible to do it alone. Labor mutual aid alone cannot achieve the development it should. Agricultural production cooperatives in neighboring inland areas are also examples. Only cooperation is the way to great development, great increase in production, permanent escape from poverty, and the good way to prevent polarization between rich and poor to achieve common prosperity.

We have already tried out a number of cooperatives. According to the preliminary production plan, they can increase production by 70% to 80% or more, which plays a banner role among the masses. We are prepared to absorb one-third of the farmers into the cooperatives this year and basically achieve cooperation next year. We believe that with the model regulations of the two agricultural production cooperatives as a basis and the specific leadership of the Party, we will be able to carry out the cooperative movement smoothly according to the regional conditions and taking into account the characteristics of the ethnic groups!

Second, while carrying out the cooperative movement, it is necessary to do a good job in other economic and cultural work. From the reports of the leaders, we know that the budget for ethnic minority areas has increased by 32% this year. In the development of forest and mineral resources, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings, special care is given to ethnic minorities! In fact, if ethnic minorities are to achieve significant progress in economic and cultural construction, in addition to their own efforts, they must also rely on the care and assistance of the state. Now we feel that there are two things that urgently need the government's help: One is to improve the script and promote the new script. Although the Lisu people had a script created by missionaries in the past, the structure was extremely incomplete. Now the Chinese Academy of Sciences has formulated a plan, and we are all very satisfied. The script is closely related to the development of politics, economy, and culture. Taking the current situation in the cooperative movement where the masses urgently need the script, many cooperatives do not have financial accountants or scorekeepers. If this continues, it will inevitably cause chaos. Other issues, such as promoting science and technology and using new pesticides and agricultural machinery, are impossible without culture. We hope that the government will approve and announce this plan as soon as possible, compile teaching materials, and allow it to catch up with our cooperative movement. The second is to build a highway and several river bridges. The Nu River is located in the valley gorges, and the transportation of goods is often very expensive, and even the state's property is lost due to untimely transportation. Last year, several thousand cartons of cigarettes were moldy. Because there are no bridges to cross the river, it is either impossible to pass, or it takes several days to detour, or it is dangerous to cross the suspension bridge, and there are dozens of accidents and deaths every year. For the sake of the construction of the Nu River region, we hope to build a highway and several river bridges soon. Other tasks such as education, health, finance and trade, small-scale industry, and technical guidance also need the government to comprehensively plan and strongly support.

    怒江地区的情况
    ——裴阿欠代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告。在该咀咒的旧社会里，人民只知官家逼着拿去老百姓的钱，只见官家拿去装腰包！而今我们人民完全知道国家的钱从何处收来，用到何处去。有目共睹，钱都用在社会主义的建设事业上，都用在各族人民的根本利益上，这是人民民主制度的体现。
    我从李富春副总理及各位首长的报告中听到，从我在的云南省怒江傈僳族自治区（州）的工作情况中体会到，从我这次从家乡到昆明，从昆明到北京，从北京到拉萨，从拉萨经成都回到北京的途中看到：祖国第一个五年计划已有了提前完成和超额完成的保证。祖国的建设事业在飞跃前进！一个居住在祖国边疆山谷里的人，一个久经风霜，尝尽辛酸苦辣的人，面对祖国一日千里的景象，特别感到心旷神怡，不自觉的要扬眉吐气！
    祖国各民族的建设成就鼓舞着我们进步，五年计划保证了我们在各方面的发展，我们要在中国共产党的领导下，满怀信心地急起直追，稳步前进：
    第一，我们准备通过互助合作的道路，直接过渡到社会主义社会。
    怒江地区的社会经济很落后，虽然贫富已有分化，也产生了一些剥削关系，但地主经济和富农经济还得不到发展，各族个体农民分散经营着农业，东种一小片干地，西种一个小坡头，不会施肥，不会细作，用一根棒棒打个洞就丢下包谷籽，当然就不会长出好庄稼，加上风、雪、冰雹、虫、兽、洪水等灾害频繁，“种下一葫芦”，就连“收一瓢”也保不住，所以过去生活就很穷困。解放后，特别是在总路线公布后，农业生产互助组织普遍建立了，在政府的大力扶持下作了不少的技术改良：如刀耕火种的逐步收缩、增加固定耕种和加工、打塘点种包谷、施用肥料等。粮食增产很多，如满子村缺粮户由总户口的58％下降到26％；畜牧方面改变了过去放野，不认真管理和配种，不积极防兽的状态，也得到了显著的发展，像俄课罗乡251户，原来只有牛148头，猪215口，不到两年就增加到牛220头，猪440口。过去种植山货药材和经济作物，一斤黄连换不到一斤盐巴，农民都灰心冷意。现在国家以合理价格收购，大家都积极了，今年他们除了扩大种植黄连、秦芄等原有作物外，还种活了41，000株茶树，又种下了600斤茶种。农业、畜牧业、副业，经济作物都有发展的前途，而且农民已经体会到组织起来的好处：不但够吃的人多了，穿着也改善了。俄课罗乡过去只有三床棉被，现在已经有了150床。发展了生产，就能改善生活！
    各族人民清楚地看到：要充分利用地力，利用自然条件，要添置大农具和新式农具，要改良技术，要抗拒自然灾害，各搞各不行，劳力互助一下也还不能获得应有的发展，邻近内地的农业生产合作社也就是榜样，只有合作化才是大发展、大增产、永远摆脱贫困的办法，才是防止贫富分化来共同富裕的好路子。
    现在我们已经试办了一批合作社，根据初步制订的生产计划，都能增产七八成以上，在群众中起了旗帜的作用，我们准备今年吸收三分之一的农户到合作社中来，明年基本实现合作化，相信我们有了两个农业生产合作社的示范章程可以依据，有党的具体领导，一定能够根据地区情况，照顾民族特点，顺利地开展合作化运动！
    第二，在合作化运动的同时，需要搞好其他经济、文化工作。从各首长的报告中知道今年民族地区的预算增长了32％，在开发森林矿藏资源中，交通运输和文化教育事业中，对少数民族是特别关怀了！事实上，少数民族要获得经济、文化建设方面的显著进步，除了自身努力外，还要靠国家的关怀和帮助。现在我们就感到有两件事亟须请求政府帮助：一是改进文字和推广新文字。傈僳族过去虽有一种传教师创制的文字，但是构造极不完全，现在中国科学院拟制好了一种方案，我们都很满意。文字与政治、经济、文化的发展关系很大，就以目前合作化运动中群众亟需文字的情形来说，许多合作社里都没有财务会计、没有记分员，长此下去，势必造成混乱；其他推广科学技术，使用新式农药农械，没有文化就不行了，我们希望政府及早批准和公布这个方案，编译教材，让它能赶上我们合作化运动。二是修一条公路和搭几座江桥，怒江地处在峡谷山箐之间，转运货物往往是豆腐盘成肉价钱，甚至转运不及时而使国家的财产遭受损失，去年就有几千条纸烟霉烂了。过江因为没有桥，或则行不通，一绕就是误几天，或则冒险过溜索，每年都有失事死亡事故数十起。为了怒江地区的建设事业，我们希望很快就修建一条公路和架几座江桥。其他交教卫生、财政贸易、小型工业、技术指导等工作，同样要请政府全面规划，大力扶持。
