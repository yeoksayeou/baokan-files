I fully agree with the 1955 national final accounts and 1956 national budget, the model charter of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, the work report of the Standing Committee, and the relevant reports and explanations by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Secretary-General Peng Zhen. Now I would like to contribute some superficial opinions on issues related to agriculture and water conservancy construction.

Our country's socialist transformation of agriculture is about to be basically completed. This new situation naturally puts forward new requirements for various construction departments, especially for agriculture and water conservancy departments. I recently had the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union for a short study tour on water conservancy construction. I heard about the process of Soviet agriculture from scattered management to collective management, and I saw the great achievements of the Soviet people in overcoming nature in agriculture and water conservancy. I feel that these have practical guiding significance for our current agricultural development. Two issues are particularly worth our attention: the reconstruction of old canals and the improvement of saline-alkali soil.

I. Reconstruction of Old Canals

The Soviet Union began agricultural collectivization in 1929. At that time, the cultivated land plots were scattered and small, and the terrain was uneven. All irrigation and drainage canal systems were designed for individual needs, making it difficult for water conservancy facilities to fully exert their effectiveness and impossible to implement mechanized farming. In order to adapt to the requirements of large-scale production after agricultural collectivization, a huge amount of effort was invested in the reconstruction of old canals from that period onwards. The reconstruction measures, within the collective farm, included not only the reconstruction of canal systems and buildings, but also a series of tasks such as land leveling, the relocation and concentration of farmers' residences, the transplanting of trees, and the opening of roads. Outside the collective farm, reasonable and necessary adjustments and reconstructions were also made to commonly related irrigation or drainage systems. After the reconstruction, the size of cultivated land plots and the slope of the ground were suitable for the use of agricultural machinery and the requirements of irrigation water distribution. Irrigation methods limited flood irrigation and promoted furrow irrigation and border irrigation to improve irrigation efficiency. Trees were transplanted to both sides of the canals or the edges of the cultivated land, which not only played a role in greening, but also played a role in wind and sand prevention for the cultivated land, and also played a role in intercepting and absorbing seepage from the canals. The planned concentration of farmers' residences created favorable conditions for improving environmental hygiene and promoting production, political, and cultural activities. In general, as a result of the reconstruction, the area of land use increased, the utilization rate of water conservancy measures increased, agricultural mechanization was implemented, agricultural production was increased, and the material and cultural life of farmers was continuously improved. Therefore, this step is indeed an important link in the forward development of agricultural collectivization.

At present, a new era of collective large-scale production has begun in our country's rural areas. Scattered cultivated land under decentralized management has been or is being concentrated and merged, and farmland water conservancy measures are being rapidly expanded and reconstructed in coordination. The rural areas of the whole country are beginning to develop rapidly towards a new socialist outlook. The road that the Soviet Union has taken is precisely the road we are currently taking. Having seen the example of the Soviet Union, we must immediately seize this link and do a good job in the entire process of old canal reconstruction.

In order to do this well, as the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program suggests, we must first do a good job in overall planning. Specifically, in terms of water conservancy, I believe that we should do a good job in river basin planning or regional planning closely related to irrigation and drainage, according to natural conditions, so as to first determine the source of irrigation water or the drainage outlet. This is to lay a good foundation for water conservancy construction and avoid disconnections or conflicts between the part and the whole in the future. At the same time, a comprehensive plan should also be made within the scope of the cooperative (or collective farm). This plan should not only take into account the current conditions, but also be able to meet the requirements of development. In terms of agricultural water conservancy, it should be based on the latest water conservancy and soil improvement science and technology, and also on the latest development of mechanized farming technology. In addition, animal husbandry, fishery, forestry, etc. are the same. This is a relatively heavy task and a relatively complex scientific task. Fortunately, the Soviet Union has decades of advanced experience that can provide us with specific guidance. As long as we attach importance to this issue and immediately learn this set of knowledge and technology from the Soviet Union in a serious manner, we will certainly be able to provide a more powerful guarantee for our agricultural development.

II. Improvement of Saline-Alkali Soil

We are currently expanding the cultivated land area and increasing the yield per unit area on a large scale in order to achieve our agricultural production increase task. This work, whether in a large area or on small plots of land, is mainly to fight against drought and waterlogging, to fight against salinization, and to fight against swampization. That is, we must overcome nature and change nature, so that soils that cannot produce or cannot produce high yields under current natural conditions become fertile soils. This is the basic problem of agricultural production increase.

To solve this problem, we must manage large rivers and carry out irrigation and drainage work extensively. In this comprehensive and complex work, I think there is a problem that deserves the attention of our water conservancy workers, that is, the close integration of irrigation and drainage with the improvement of saline-alkali soil.

In our China, the improvement of saline-alkali soil is a very important issue in agricultural development. Because its scope is very broad, the main areas are the coastal saline-alkali areas, extending from the Liaodong Peninsula to the mouth of the Yangtze River, where the soil salinity is very high. There are also sporadic saline-alkali soil distributions along the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong; On both sides of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, especially in the North China Plain, salinization occurs in most areas where the terrain is flat and low-lying and drainage is poor; In the irrigated areas upstream and downstream of the Yellow River, due to unreasonable irrigation water use and failure to pay attention to the establishment of drainage systems, soil salinization has generally formed, such as in the old Ningxia irrigation area and the Houtao irrigation area, which are the most prominent; Other areas, such as the Weibei irrigation area in Shaanxi, the Fenhe irrigation area in Shanxi, and various irrigation areas in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, also have varying degrees of salinization, and some areas are increasing in severity over time. In addition, there are many saline-alkali soil areas scattered in Xinjiang, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast. According to preliminary estimates, the area of saline-alkali soil in the country is about 300 million mu. In order to increase agricultural production, how to take active measures to improve such a large area of ​​saline-alkali soil should be a matter of particular importance.

Since the development of agricultural cooperation, the masses of farmers in various places have used their wisdom and experience to create many methods to fight against salinization and have achieved considerable success. For example, Hua'an Farm in Anyang City, Henan Province, has 1,133 mu of severely saline-alkali land. After digging drainage ditches, irrigating with water to wash away alkali, and implementing deep plowing in winter, shallow plowing in spring, multiple cultivations, and selecting and cultivating fine varieties, in 1955, the cotton land of 1,125 mu produced an average of 270 jin of seed cotton per mu, of which 200 mu produced 300 jin, and the highest reached 460 jin. There are many similar examples in other places. This shows that saline-alkali soil can be effectively improved into high-yielding cultivated land.

In the Soviet Union, there are also vast areas of saline-alkali land that are being improved in stages to increase production. The main measures for soil improvement are to establish an effective drainage system, arrange ditches of appropriate depth and density according to soil properties, and in areas with poor soil permeability, it is also necessary to use clay pipes buried underground as field drainage culverts, because they can be spaced more closely without affecting mechanized cultivation. The drainage outlet must be kept unobstructed. If the terrain and water level are limited and cannot be discharged smoothly by gravity, pumping stations should be set up. The drainage effect must ensure that the groundwater level does not exceed a certain height, in principle, it should be below the soil capillary action range, generally about 1.5 meters below the ground. At the same time, there must be an irrigation system to supply fresh water for cleaning. This method can ensure that the salt content of the surface soil is removed and maintained as good soil, and a stable high yield is obtained.

For example, the Zhangfarhan Experimental Farm in the Azerbaijan Republic of the Soviet Union originally produced only about 10 quintals of cotton per hectare in saline-alkali soil (equivalent to 133 jin of seed cotton per mu). After being improved by the above method, the cotton yield reached about 42 quintals per hectare (equivalent to 560 jin of seed cotton per mu). After being推广 (popularized) to a large area, in the initial stage, in order to save investment, underground pipes were not used as in the experimental field, so the drainage efficiency was lower than that of the experimental field, and the average yield of seed cotton per hectare also reached about 25 quintals (equivalent to 333 jin per mu). Other crops have also increased in multiples.

Having seen the example of the Soviet Union and our domestic experience, we can recognize that: saline-alkali soil can be improved and maintained as fertile soil; after the saline-alkali soil is improved, the yield per unit area can be increased by two or three times or more; the main measures for improving saline-alkali soil are a complete drainage system and fresh water irrigation.

With the above-mentioned understanding, and seeing that the areas with relatively serious saline-alkali soil in our country are the Yellow River Basin, North China, Inner Mongolia, and the Northwest regions, these many regions are also relatively arid and in urgent need of irrigation. Therefore, eliminating drought and eliminating salinization should be a unified solution to the overall problem. The purpose of holding irrigation is to maintain and improve the fertility of the soil; the premise of eliminating salinization is to establish an irrigation system; and the two rely more on the drainage system to connect with each other and achieve the final task.

For this reason, at present and in the future, in the vast Yellow River Basin, North China, and Northwest regions, the irrigation system established only for drought should take measures to prevent the rise of the groundwater level, including the arrangement of canal system return water, the reduction of canal bed leakage, and especially important is to improve irrigation methods, avoid flood irrigation as much as possible, use furrow irrigation or border irrigation instead, and promote planned water use. In this way, water can be saved to expand the irrigation area, and at the same time, it can prevent the continuous rise of the groundwater level in the irrigated area, causing soil salinization. For areas where the groundwater level in the irrigated area has caused salinization, a drainage system should be added immediately to control it. For the original saline-alkali areas, a complete system combining drainage and irrigation should be established to achieve the purpose of soil improvement. Solving irrigation, drainage, and alkali washing together in this way can solve the irrigation problem in the most arid areas of the country, and at the same time, the most severely saline-alkali areas in the country can be fundamentally improved. Hundreds of millions of mu of agricultural products can obtain several times the stable increase in production. I think this should be an important goal for our agricultural and water conservancy workers.

    我对农业和水利建设的一点意见
    ——须恺代表
    我对于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，高级农业生产合作社示范章程，常务委员会工作报告以及李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长、彭真秘书长的有关报告和说明，完全同意。现在我想就农业和水利建设有关的问题，贡献一些肤浅意见。
    我们全国农业的社会主义化，就将基本完成，这个新的形势，自然的对于各个建设部门，提出了新的要求，特别对于农业和水利部门。我最近有机会到了苏联对水利建设作了短期的参观学习，听到了苏联农业从分散经营到集体经营的过程，看到了苏联人民在农业和水利方面战胜自然的伟大成就，觉得对于我们目前的农业发展，都有现实的指导意义，其中有两个问题更值得我们注意，一是旧渠改建问题，二是盐碱土改良问题。
    一、旧渠改建问题
    苏联1929年农业集体化开始，当时耕地地块零星细小，又是高低不平，所有灌溉排水渠系，各自为谋，水利设施难以充分发挥功效，机械耕作亦无法实施。为了适应农业集体化以后的大生产要求，从那个时期起，投下了巨大力量，从事于旧渠的改建。改建的措施，在农庄以内，除了渠系和建筑物的改建以外，同时还包括了土地的平整，农民住宅的迁移集中，树木的移植和道路的开辟等一系列工作。在农庄以外，还要就共同有关的灌溉或排水系统，同时做合理的必要的调整和改建。改建以后，耕地地块的大小和地面的坡度要适合于农业机械的使用，也适合于灌溉配水的要求。灌溉方法，限制漫灌，提倡沟灌和畦灌，以提高灌溉效率。树木移植到渠道两侧或耕地的边沿，不仅起了绿化作用，并且对耕地起了防风防沙作用，对渠道渗水，也起了拦截吸收作用。农户有计划的集中居住，对于环境卫生的改善，生产活动和政治文化活动的提高改进，都造成了有利条件。总的说，改建的结果，土地使用面积加大，水利措施利用率提高，农业机械化得以实行，农业生产得以增加，农民的物质文化生活得以不断提高。所以这一步工作，实在是农业集体化向前发展的重要环节。
    目前我们全国农村已开始了集体化大生产的新时代，分散经营的零星耕地已经或者正在着手集中合并，农田水利措施，正在配合着迅速扩充和改建，全国农村，正开始向新的社会主义面貌飞速的发展。苏联所走过的道路，正是我们目前要走的道路。看了苏联的榜样，我们必须马上抓住这个环节，做好旧渠改建的整套工作。
    为了做好这步工作，正如全国农业发展纲要所提示的精神，首先要做好全面规划。具体到水利方面，我认为要按自然条件，做好和灌溉排水密切有关的河流的流域规划或区域规划，从而先行决定灌溉水源或排水尾闾。这样做是为了给水利建设扎好根，避免以后局部和整体的脱节或发生矛盾。同时合作社（或农庄）范围以内也要做好全面计划，这个计划既能够照顾到目前条件，也必须能够符合发展要求。在农业水利方面，要以最新的水利土壤改良科学技术为基础，同时要以最新发展的机械耕作技术为基础，此外，如畜牧业、渔业、森林业等等也是一样。这是一套比较繁重的工作，也是一套比较复杂的科学工作。所欣幸的是苏联已经有了几十年的先进经验，可以给我们具体指导，我们只要重视这个问题，马上认真的向苏联学习好这套知识和技术，一定可以令我们的农业发展，得到更有力的保障。
    二、盐碱土改良问题
    我们目前正在大规模的扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量，来达成我们农业增 产的任务。这项工作，不论是在大面积的区域或者是在小片土地上，主要的是对水旱作斗争，对盐碱化作斗争，对沼泽化作斗争，就是我们要克服自然改变自然，令目前自然条件下不能生产或者不能丰产的土壤变成肥沃的土壤，这是农业增产的基本问题。
    我们要解决这个问题，一方面要进行大江大河的治理，一方面要广泛的开展灌溉排水工作。在这样全面性的繁复工作里面，我认为有一个问题，值得我们水利工作者重视的，是灌溉排水和改良盐碱土的密切结合问题。
    在我们中国，盐碱土壤的改良，是农业发展中的一个十分重要的问题。因为它的范围十分广大，主要的有滨海盐碱区，自辽东半岛延展到扬子江口，土壤盐碱很重，浙江、福建、广东沿海亦有零星盐碱土分布；黄河下游两岸尤其是华北平原，凡属地势平坦低洼排水不畅的地区，大都发生盐碱化；黄河上下游灌溉区域，由于灌溉用水的不合理和没有注意排水系统的建立，普遍的形成了土壤盐碱化，如旧时的宁夏灌区，和后套灌区，最为显著；其它如陕西的渭北灌区，山西的汾河灌区，以及黄河下游各灌区也都有程度不同的盐碱化现象，有些地区并随时间而增加严重性。此外，如新疆、甘肃、内蒙、东北，还散布了不少的盐碱化土壤地区。据初步估计，全国盐碱化土壤面积约有三亿亩。为了农业增产，如何采取积极措施来改良这样广大面积的盐碱化土壤，应该是值得特别重视的问题。
    自农业合作化开展以来，各地农民群众，运用它们的智慧和经验，创造了不少方法和盐碱化作斗争，并取得了相当成就。例如河南省安阳市华安农场有1，133亩盐碱严重土地，经过了开挖排水沟，浇水灌溉洗碱，并施行了冬深耕，春浅耕，多次中耕以及选培良种等措施，1955年棉花地1，125亩每亩平均产籽棉270斤，其中有200亩300斤，最高的达到460斤。其他各地亦有不少类似的例子。这说明了盐碱化土壤，是可以有效的加以改良成为丰产耕地的。
    在苏联也有广大的盐碱化土地正在分期改良以增加生产。土壤改良的主要措施，是建立有效的排水系统，按照土壤性质，布置适当深度和密度的沟渠，在土壤渗水性较差的地区，并有必要采用陶管埋置地下作为田间排水暗道，因为可以距离较密而不影响机耕。排水出口，必须保持通畅，如果因为地形水位受到限制不能自流畅泄时，应设置抽水站。排水效果务令地下水位不超过一定高度，原则上应在土壤毛细管作用范围以下，一般的在地面以下1.5公尺左右。同时要有灌溉系统供给淡水加以清洗。这样做法，可以保证将面层土壤的含盐清除出去，并保持为良好土壤，获得稳定的丰产。
    例如苏联阿塞拜疆共和国张法尔汉试验场原来盐碱化土壤生产棉花仅每公顷10公担左右（折合每亩133斤籽棉）。经用上述方法改良以后，棉花产量达到每公顷42公担左右（折合每亩560斤籽棉），经推广到大片面积上，在初期为了节省投资，没有照试验场一样采用暗管，排水效率因而比试验场较低，每公顷籽棉产量亦平均达到了25公担左右（折合每亩333斤）。其它农作物，亦同样的以倍数增产。
    看了苏联的榜样和我们国内的经验，可以认识到：盐碱土壤是可以改良和保持成为肥沃土壤的；盐碱土壤改良以后，就单位面积产量讲，可以增加二、三倍或者更多；改良盐碱土壤的主要措施是完善的排水系统和淡水灌溉。
    有了上面所谈的认识，再看到了我们盐碱化土壤比较严重的地区是黄河流域、华北、内蒙和西北地区，这许多地区，也就是比较干旱而急需开展灌溉的地区，因之，消除干旱，消除盐碱化，应该是要统一解决的整体问题。举办灌溉要以保持和改进土壤的肥沃性为目标；消除盐碱化，要以建立灌溉系统为前提；而两者之间更依靠着排水系统来相互联结和达成最后任务。
    为此，目前及以后在广大的黄河流域，华北和西北等地区，只是为了干旱而建立的灌溉系统，应该采取措施防止地下水位升高，包括渠系退水的安排，渠床渗漏的减小，尤其重要的要改进灌溉方法，尽量避免漫灌，改用沟灌或畦灌，并推行计划用水，这样做，既可以节省水量来扩大灌溉面积，同时就可以防止灌区地下水位的不断升高造成土壤的盐碱化。对于灌区地下水位已经造成盐碱化的区域，应即添修排水系统来加以控制。对于原来盐碱化的区域应该建立完善的排水和灌溉相结合的系统，达到土壤改良的目的。这样将灌溉排水洗碱结合为一体加以解决，全国最为干旱的地区，灌溉问题解决了，同时也就使全国盐碱化最为严重的地区，得到了根本的改良，几亿亩的农产，可以获得几倍的稳固的增产，我想这应该是我们农业和水利工作者的重要奋斗目标。
