Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 26th: It was announced here on the 25th that Indian Prime Minister Nehru had written a letter to US President Eisenhower suggesting that his visit to the United States, originally scheduled for July, be postponed in view of Eisenhower's failure to fully recover from his illness.

Eisenhower replied to Nehru, agreeing to his suggestion. Eisenhower said in his letter: "I know you would not want to come here merely for a series of official ceremonies. To make your trip worthwhile, we should be confident that we can hold frank discussions as we originally agreed." He expressed the hope that the postponement of such talks with Nehru would not be too long.

    尼赫鲁推迟访美日期
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：这里二十五日宣布，印度总理尼赫鲁写给美国总统艾森豪威尔一封信，鉴于艾森豪威尔病后还没有恢复健康，建议推迟他原订于七月去美国访问的日期。
    艾森豪威尔复信给尼赫鲁，同意他的建议。艾森豪威尔在信里说：“我知道你不愿仅仅为了一系列官方仪式而到这里来。为了使你不虚此行，我们应当有把握可以按照我们原来的约定举行坦率的会谈。”他表示希望同尼赫鲁举行这种会谈推迟的时日不会过久。
