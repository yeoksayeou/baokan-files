    Solving the Housing Problem of Workers and Staff

    The housing shortage is currently a very serious problem in the lives of workers and staff. At the recently concluded National Trade Union Labor Insurance, Living and Housing Work Conference, representatives from various regions reported severe housing shortages. At the ongoing Third Session of the First National People's Congress, many people's representatives also called for a solution to the housing problem for workers and staff. It is estimated that about 900,000 worker and staff households across the country have not yet had their housing problems resolved. This problem is clearly very urgent.

    In recent years, the state has built a considerable number of houses for workers and staff. From 1953 to 1955 alone, more than 30 million square meters of new housing for workers and staff were built. Such a large scale of residential construction is unprecedented in our history. However, due to the rapid development of national construction and the continuous expansion of the working class and the industrial population, and because the living conditions of workers in old China were so poor, the growth of residential construction still cannot keep up with the needs. The housing in the Yumen Mining Bureau has increased 3.96 times in recent years, which is not a slow pace, but the number of employees has increased 11.6 times in the same period, so there is certainly not enough housing. From 1949 to the end of 1955, nearly 1.5 million square meters of new housing was built for workers and staff in Shenyang. In 1955, the residential area for workers and staff increased by 31.2% compared to 1949. The number is not small, but the number of workers and staff in Shenyang increased by 217% during the same period, so the tension of the housing problem is even more serious.

    Can the current housing shortage problem be said to be inevitable? Obviously not. In the past few years, although a lot of work has been done to solve the housing problem for workers and staff, there are still shortcomings. Leaders of many departments are detached from the masses, do not understand the hardships of workers and staff on the housing issue, treat the housing problem of workers and staff with a bureaucratic attitude, and have not taken serious measures; there are also excessively high standards, unrealistic, and formalistic tendencies in residential construction. Due to these shortcomings in the work, the housing problem for workers and staff, which could have been solved better than it is now, has not been solved better. Now some workers and staff are suffering from having nowhere to live, lamenting that "there is no place to stand in this vast world," and some workers and staff are curled up in cement pipes used to repair sewers, jokingly calling themselves living in "public hotels." Are these all inevitable?

    The housing problem for workers and staff can be solved better, and should be solved better.

    Can it be considered that the housing shortage problem is just a personal living problem for workers and staff, and therefore, in daily work, it is placed in an insignificant position? No. Because if we do not care about the personal lives and welfare of workers and staff, we cannot better encourage them to care about the collective interests. It is wrong in itself to think that the housing shortage problem is just a personal living problem and therefore not pay attention to it. Moreover, the housing problem for workers and staff is not just a personal living problem; the housing problem is closely related to production. If the problem of living is not solved, workers and staff cannot rest well and study well, how can it not affect production? The housing problem is not only closely related to production, but its impact often goes beyond the scope of the enterprise and affects the entire society. Therefore, the housing problem is also a social problem. When people have to sleep in bathrooms, have to live in caves and bunkers, when "two families live in the same room" and "three generations live in the same room," when newlyweds are separated and cannot meet all year round because one party is transferred to work and "no family members are allowed without housing," how is the housing shortage problem not a social problem?

    Some comrades understand "improving the lives of workers and staff on the basis of developing production" as being able to ignore the lives of workers and staff and first develop production, and then solve the living problems of workers and staff after production has developed. People who hold this view, when planning, are keen to calculate how much production will expand and how many people will increase in seven or twelve years, but do not consider how much the housing for workers and staff also needs to increase accordingly. The famous Beijing Department Store opened, and more than a thousand staff members serve there, but until the opening, no one had considered the accommodation problem for the staff. This idea and practice of dividing stages between developing production and improving the lives of workers and staff is a distortion of the Party's policy and an attitude of nihilism towards improving the lives of workers and staff. Developing production and improving the lives of workers and staff are not a sequential relationship but a proportional relationship in the Party's policy; they interact with each other, and it is wrong to eliminate either aspect.

    To solve the housing problem for more than 900,000 workers and staff households, it is necessary to build 27 million square meters of housing. Obviously, such a large demand cannot be met in the short term. However, it would be wrong to adopt a "take it slow" attitude because of this. Because production is always developing, and the ranks of the working class are always expanding. This year, one hundred workers and staff need housing. If we "take it slow" and do not actively find ways to solve it, there may be two hundred workers and staff who need housing next year, and it will be even more difficult to solve at that time. Therefore, taking it slow is not feasible, we must quickly come up with solutions and quickly solve the problem.

    How to solve the housing problem for workers and staff? The most important thing is to rely on state investment. The investment in residential construction in the state budget for 1956 has increased significantly compared to last year. This year, the residential area built by various ministries and affiliated enterprises of the central government for workers and staff will reach 13.1 million square meters, which can solve part of the problem. However, it is not enough to rely entirely on state investment to solve the housing problem for workers and staff. The state's financial resources are limited, and the country's construction is pressing, so we cannot solve the housing problem for workers and staff by weakening national construction projects and allocating more investment. Therefore, to solve the housing problem for workers and staff, we must also mobilize all positive factors. Many enterprises have accumulated a considerable amount of enterprise bonus funds over the years, and a portion can be used to build housing for workers and staff. Last year, the railway and coal mine systems used the method of self-construction with public assistance to solve the accommodation problem for 35,000 workers and staff households, which is also a good experience. All regions and enterprises with conditions can adopt this method to solve part of the problem under the principle of voluntary participation of workers and staff. In addition, existing housing for workers and staff should be reasonably adjusted and private housing should be fully utilized.

    When building housing for workers and staff, construction standards should not be set too high. The principle of building housing for workers and staff should be practicality, economy, and building as many houses as possible. But this does not mean that the issue of quality can be ignored. The quality of construction should be guaranteed under any circumstances. It is not right for some enterprises to build so-called "simple houses" that cannot resist wind and cold and have the danger of collapsing.

    In order to mobilize various positive factors and basically solve the housing problem for workers and staff as quickly as possible, all departments and enterprises should start to formulate plans to solve the housing problem for workers and staff, and announce the plans to the masses to mobilize the masses to supervise the implementation of the plans.

### 解决职工住宅问题

    解决职工住宅问题
    房荒问题是目前职工生活中一个很严重的问题。在不久以前闭幕的全国工会劳动保险、生活住宅工作会议上，各地的代表都反映房荒严重。在目前正在召开的第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上，许多人民代表也呼吁解决职工住宅问题。据估计目前全国约有九十万户职工的住宅问题没有解决。这个问题显然是非常迫切的。
    这几年来国家为职工盖的房子是不少的，仅1953年到1955年，就新建了职工住宅三千多万平方公尺。像这样巨大的住宅建筑的规模，在我国历史上还是空前的。但是，由于国家建设事业的迅速发展，工人阶级的队伍不断扩大，工业人口不断增长，由于旧中国工人的居住条件太坏，住宅建筑的增长还是赶不上需要。玉门矿务局几年来住宅增加了3.96倍，速度不算不快，可是同一时期职工人数却增长了11.6倍，房子当然很不够住。沈阳市从1949年到1955年末，为职工新建的住宅近150万平方公尺，1955年职工的住宅面积已比1949年增长了31.2％，数字也不能算小，可是同一时期沈阳市的职工人数却增长了217％，所以住宅问题的紧张程度也更加严重了。
    目前的房荒问题是不是就可以说是不可避免的呢？显然不是的。过去这几年来，在解决职工住宅问题方面虽然做了许多工作，仍然是有缺点的。不少部门的领导人员脱离群众，不了解职工在房子问题上的疾苦，用官僚主义态度来对待职工的房子问题，没有认真采取措施；在住宅建筑方面也有标准过高的、脱离实际的、形式主义的偏向。由于工作上存在着这些缺点，就使得原来可以解决得比现在好些的职工住宅问题，没有能够解决得更好一些。现在有的职工苦于无处安身，感慨“天地之大竟无容身之地”，有的职工卷缩在修下水道用的水泥筒里，自嘲为住“大众旅馆”，难道这些都是不可避免的吗？
    职工住宅问题是可以解决得好些，也是应该解决得好些的。
    能不能认为房荒问题，只是职工个人的生活问题，因而在日常工作中，就把它放在一个无足轻重的位置上呢？不能。因为不关心职工个人的生活福利，就不能更好地鼓舞职工来关心集体利益。以为房荒问题只是职工个人的生活问题就不予重视，本身就是错误的。况且职工住宅问题并不仅是个人的生活问题，住宅问题同生产息息相关。住的问题不解决，职工不能很好地休息，很好地学习，怎么能够不影响生产呢？住宅问题还不仅同生产息息相关，它的影响常常越出企业的范围，波及整个社会。因此，房子问题也是一个社会问题。当人们不得不睡在浴室里，不得不住在山洞里、碉堡里的时候，当“两户同房”“三代同房”的时候，当新婚男女因一方调动工作，在“没有房子，不准带家眷”的情况下，天各一方，终年不能见面的时候，房荒问题怎么不是社会问题呢？
    有些同志把“在发展生产的基础上改善职工生活”，理解为可以抛开职工生活不管，先去发展生产，等到生产发展了，再来解决职工生活问题。持这种见解的人，搞起规划来，热衷于计算七年后、十二年后生产扩大多少，人员增加多少，却不考虑职工住宅也需要相应地增加多少。北京市著名的百货大楼开幕了，有一千多个工作人员在那里服务，可是一直到开幕的时候，还没有人考虑过工作人员的住宿问题。这种在发展生产同改善职工生活之间划分阶段的想法和做法，是对党的政策的曲解，是对改善职工生活采取取消主义的态度。发展生产同改善职工生活，在党的政策中，不是先后关系，而是比例关系，它们是相互作用的，取消哪一个方面都是错误的。
    要解决九十多万户职工的房子问题，就要建筑二千七百万平方公尺的住宅。显然，这么大的需要量，决不是短期内能够满足的。不过，如果因此就抱定“慢慢来”的态度却是错误的。因为生产总是在发展的，工人阶级的队伍总是不断扩大的，今年有一百个职工要房子，“慢慢来”，不积极设法解决，明年就可能有二百个职工要房子，到那时更难解决。因此，慢慢来是不行的，必须快快来想办法，快快来解决问题。
    怎么解决职工住宅问题呢？最主要的，还是依靠国家投资。1956年国家预算中的住宅建筑投资比去年大大增加，今年中央各部和所属企业为职工修建的住宅面积将达到1，310万平方公尺，可以解决一部分问题。但是，完全依靠国家投资来解决职工住宅问题是不够的。国家的财力有限，国家的建设迫不及待，不能用削弱国家建设项目的办法，拨出更多的投资来解决职工住宅问题。因此，解决职工住宅问题，还必须把各方面的积极因素都动员起来。许多企业历年来都积压了相当数量的企业奖励基金，可以动用一部分来兴建职工住宅。铁路、煤矿两个系统去年用自建公助的办法，解决了三万五千户职工的住宿问题，也是一个好的经验。一切有条件的地区和企业，在职工自愿的原则下，都可以采用这个办法来解决一部分问题。此外，还应该合理地调整现有的职工住宅，充分利用民房。
    在建筑职工住宅的时候，不应该把建筑标准订得过高。建筑职工住宅的原则应该是适用、经济、尽可能多建一些房子。但这并不是说质量问题就可以不管了。建筑的质量，在任何情况下都是应该保证的。现在有些企业把所谓“简易住宅”盖得既不能挡风寒，又有倒塌的危险，这是不对的。
    为了把各种积极因素动员起来，尽可能快地基本上解决职工的住宅问题，各个部门、各个企业都应该着手编制解决职工住宅问题的规划，并且把规划向群众宣布，动员群众来监督规划的实施。
