Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 31st (Reporters Chen Jiajin, Zhao Qi) – Today, the central delegation's main group departed the ancient city of Lhasa amidst a grand farewell from over 30,000 people. They will fly from the suburban airport back to Beijing.

　　The large tent for bidding farewell to the guests was set up in the Jieguan Hall, where the guests were welcomed more than a month ago. The hosts, led by the Dalai Lama, arrived early to see them off.

　　The farewell ceremony was held in the large tent. The Dalai Lama spoke, wishing the guests a safe journey. Chen Yi expressed his gratitude for the warm reception from the hosts in his speech. Key cadres of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and representatives from various parts of Tibet presented Hada scarves to the guests as they bid farewell.

　　Before leaving Jieguan Hall, Zhang Jingwu said to the Dalai Lama, "If you need anything, I can have it sent to you from Beijing." The Dalai Lama said that he hoped to receive some of Chairman Mao's works.

　　The Dalai Lama accompanied Chen Yi and others in reviewing the Tibetan military honor guard. The Tibetan military band played the national anthem as they were reviewed. The guests then entered the farewell procession of over 30,000 people. Forty Young Pioneers wearing red scarves surged forward, presenting flowers to Chen Yi and others. Hundreds of children from Lhasa Elementary School vied to shake hands and say goodbye to the guests. Tens of thousands of Lhasa citizens surged forward to get another close look at their relatives from Beijing, some leaning into the car windows to wish the guests a safe journey. Lamas from the three major monasteries of Lhasa played Buddhist music and used Buddhist greetings, clasping their hands together in farewell. As the guests passed through the farewell procession of Tibetan and Han workers, the Tibetan and Han workers waved colorful paper flags and shouted, "Wishing our dear ones a safe journey!"

　　At the end of the farewell procession, the hosts and guests exchanged Hada scarves and shook hands again to say goodbye. The Dalai Lama said, "I have already entrusted someone to take a letter to Chairman Mao to report on my work. Please, Vice Premier Chen Yi, report to Chairman Mao in detail on the work in Tibet and the situation of unity and progress, and ask Chairman Mao to send more letters and telegrams to instruct my work." Chen Yi said to the Dalai Lama, "For the sake of the motherland and Tibet, I hope you take care of your health."

    中央代表团总团离拉萨
    据新华社拉萨31日电　新华社记者陈家璡、赵奇报道：今天，中央代表团总团在三万多人的盛大欢送下告别了古城拉萨。他们将从市郊机场乘飞机回北京。
    欢送客人的大帐篷，设在一个多月前欢迎客人的接官厅里。以达赖喇嘛为首的主人们，提前到这里来送行。
    欢送仪式在大帐篷里举行。达赖喇嘛讲话祝客人们一路平安。陈毅在讲话中对主人的热情接待表示感谢。西藏自治区筹备委员会主要干部和西藏各地的代表，在这里向客人们献哈达送行。
    在离开接官厅以前，张经武对达赖喇嘛说，你需要什么东西，我可以从北京给你送来。达赖喇嘛说他希望能带来一些毛主席的著作。
    达赖喇嘛陪着陈毅等人检阅了藏军仪仗队。藏军的军乐队吹奏着国歌接受检阅。客人们从这里进入了三万多人的欢送行列。带着红领巾的四十名少年先锋队员跳跃着涌上来向陈毅等人献花，拉萨小学的几百个孩子争着和客人握手告别。上万的拉萨市民，涌上来再仔细看一看从北京来的亲人，有的伏到车窗口祝客人们一路平安。拉萨三大寺的喇嘛，吹奏着佛乐，还用佛教徒的礼节夹道合掌欢送。客人穿过藏、汉族工人的欢送行列时，藏汉族工人挥着彩色纸旗高呼：祝亲人们一路平安！
    在欢送行列尽头，主人和客人又互献哈达握手告别。达赖喇嘛说：我已经托人给毛主席带去了一封信向他汇报了工作，请陈毅副总理再代我详细地把西藏工作和团结进步的情况汇报给毛主席，请毛主席多来信和电报指示我的工作。陈毅对达赖喇嘛说，为了祖国和西藏，希望你保重身体。
