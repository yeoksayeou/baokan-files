Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 2nd: Gamal Abdel Nasser said on June 1st that Egypt would begin a new era of political freedom, economic development, and national independence based on neutrality.

The Egyptian Prime Minister said, while delivering a political speech to representatives of cooperatives meeting at Cairo University, that Egypt had almost achieved its first goal of foreign policy – eliminating imperialism, ending and getting rid of foreign occupation, and not allowing a single foreign soldier to remain in Egypt.

He said that the people had waged a long struggle to win the day when the British would completely withdraw from Suez (June 18th). He said that the arrival of this day would end the past situation in which "our country was often under imperialist occupation and the shadow of the British flag." He was warmly cheered when he said these words.

Abdel Nasser said that holding a referendum on June 23rd to approve the constitution would end the transitional period of the revolution. After this, the Revolutionary Command Council would be dissolved. He said: Now that the transitional period has passed, Egypt is entering a new stage in its life – the stage of "work, struggle, production" to build the country.

The Egyptian Prime Minister said that Egypt's policy must be to ensure domestic stability in order to continue the revolution in the economic field.

When talking about foreign policy, Abdel Nasser said that Egypt's policy is neither pro-Eastern nor pro-Western, but is based on the interests of Egypt and other Arab countries.

He said that Egypt did not want to interfere with British oil interests in the Middle East, but only to safeguard the independence of Arab countries.

He criticized the Baghdad Pact, believing it was a conspiracy by Britain to keep the Arab world as a sphere of influence for Britain. He said that the Baghdad Pact "is just a springboard for attacking us, attacking Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, attacking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and attacking Sudan and Libya."

He said: Egypt's policy is to organize self-defense arising from the Arab nation and Arab lands, without the participation of any other country outside the Arab nation. And without the participation of any major powers, so that we can realize our independence and sovereignty, and free ourselves from foreign influence.

    “工作、奋斗、生产”以建设国家
    纳赛尔说埃及进入自己生命的新阶段
    新华社2日讯　开罗消息：加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔六月一日说，埃及将开始一个政治自由、经济发展和以中立为基础的民族独立的新纪元。
    这位埃及总理对在开罗大学开会的合作社的代表们发表政治演说的时候说，埃及已经差不多达到它的外交政策的第一个目标——清除帝国主义、结束和摆脱外国占领、不使一个外国士兵留在埃及国内。
    他说，为了争取英国人完全撤出苏彝士的一天（六月十八日）的到来，人民进行了长期的斗争。他说，这一天的到来将结束过去那种“我国经常处在帝国主义占领和英国国旗的阴影之下”的局面。他说这些话的时候受到了热烈的欢呼。
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔说，在六月二十三日举行公民投票来批准宪法一事，将结束革命的过渡时期。在这以后，革命指导委员会将予解散。他说：现在既然过渡时期已经过去，埃及就要进入自己生命中的新阶段——“工作、奋斗、生产”以建设国家的阶段。
    这位埃及总理说，埃及的政策必须是保证国内的稳定，以便继续在经济方面进行革命。
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔在谈到对外政策的时候说，埃及的政策既不是亲东方的，也不是亲西方的，它是以埃及和其他阿拉伯国家的利益为基础的。
    他说，埃及不想干涉英国在中东的石油利益，只是要保障阿拉伯国家的独立。
    他抨击巴格达条约，认为这是英国要使阿拉伯世界继续成为英国的一个势力范围的阴谋。他说，巴格达条约“只是进攻我们、进攻叙利亚、黎巴嫩和约旦，进攻沙特阿拉伯王国和埃及、进攻苏丹和利比亚的一个跳板”。
    他说：埃及的政策是要组织从阿拉伯民族和阿拉伯土地产生的自卫，而不要阿拉伯民族以外的任何其他国家参加。并且不要任何大国参加，以便我们能够实现我们的独立和主权，并且使我们摆脱外国的影响。
