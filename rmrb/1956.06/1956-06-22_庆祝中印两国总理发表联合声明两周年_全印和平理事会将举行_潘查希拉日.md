Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 20th: The All-India Peace Council has decided to hold "Panchsheel (Hindi Five Principles) Day" on June 28 to celebrate the second anniversary of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' Joint Statement.

The Council held a meeting in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, from June 15 to 17. The meeting also decided to designate August 6 as "Hiroshima Day," on which day it will widely publicize the demand for a ban on all nuclear and thermonuclear weapons tests. The meeting decided to convene the Fifth All-India Peace Conference in October or November of this year.

The meeting passed a resolution stating that the people of Asian countries are increasingly disturbed by the explosion of atomic and hydrogen bombs in the Pacific region. The resolution called on the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to agree to cease all nuclear weapons tests, and said that "this would not only be the first step in reaching an international agreement on the thorny issue of disarmament and the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons, but also restore the confidence of people all over the world."

The All-India Peace Council's resolution on "Disarmament Issues" welcomed "the decisions made last year by certain countries, including the Soviet Union and Britain, to reduce the size of their armed forces. The Council particularly welcomes the recent decision by the Soviet government to make large-scale cuts in its military spending and the size of its armed forces, and calls on other major powers to endorse this action."

The resolution on "Military Treaties" condemned "the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, believing that their content and purpose are aggressive." The resolution stated, "These treaties threaten the independence and national sovereignty of our country and all Asian-African countries. Recent efforts to disguise them as instruments of economic assistance have not changed their nature and purpose." The resolution called on "all Asian-African countries not to associate with these treaties." The resolution protested against "the improper interference of the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the Kashmir issue."

The meeting also passed a resolution on Indo-Pakistani relations. This resolution expressed extreme unease about the recent deterioration in relations between India and Pakistan, "which is the result of increased US military aid to Pakistan." The Council called on the people of India and Pakistan to work together to "stop foreign interference that is exacerbating tensions between the two countries" and to organize trade and cultural exchanges between the two countries.

In a resolution on the "Colonialism Issue," the Council accused "colonialists of continuing to implement racial discrimination policies." The resolution accused the colonialists of refusing to accept the proposals put forward by the Malayan and Cypriot freedom movements to resolve issues through peaceful negotiations. The resolution called for new negotiations to be held on the basis of respect for the freedom and independence rights of the people.

The Council passed another resolution supporting Prime Minister Nehru's five-point plan for resolving the Algerian issue and called on the people of India to hold an "Algeria Day" to support the Algerian people's national independence movement.

    庆祝中印两国总理发表联合声明两周年
    全印和平理事会将举行“潘查希拉日”
    据新华社新德里20日讯　　全印和平理事会已经决定在六月二十八日举行“潘查希拉（印地语五项原则）日”，庆祝中印两国总理发表联合声明两周年。
    理事会六月十五日到十七日在拉贾斯坦邦首府斋浦尔举行了会议，会议还决定以八月六日为“广岛日”，在这一天将广泛宣传要求禁止一切核子和热核子武器试验的主张。会议决定在今年十月或十一月召开第五次全印和平大会。
    会议通过决议说，亚洲各国人民对在太平洋地区爆炸原子弹和氢弹越来越感到不安。决议吁请美国、英国和苏联同意停止一切核子武器试验，并且说“这样不但会是就裁军和完全禁止核子武器的这一棘手问题取得国际协议的第一步，而且会恢复全世界人民的信心。”
    全印和平理事会通过的关于“裁军问题”的决议，欢迎“某些国家，包括苏联和英国去年作出的关于裁减它们的军队人数的决定。理事会特别欢迎苏联政府最近作出的关于把它的军事开支和它的军队人数进行大规模削减的决定，并且要求其他的大国赞同这种行动。”
    关于“军事条约”的决议，谴责“东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约，认为它们的内容和目的都是侵略性的”。决议说，“这些条约威胁着我们国家和所有亚非国家的独立和国家主权。最近为了把它们装扮成为经济援助的工具所作出的努力并没有改变它们的性质和目的。”决议呼吁“所有亚非国家不同这些条约发生联系”。决议对于“巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织不正当地干涉克什米尔问题”的做法提出抗议。
    会议还通过了一项关于印巴关系的决议。这项决议对于最近印度同巴基斯坦之间的关系的恶化感到极为不安，这种恶化是美国给巴基斯坦的军事援助增加的结果”。理事会号召印度和巴基斯坦人民共同努力“制止使得两国之间的紧张局势加剧的外国干涉”，组织两国之间的贸易和文化交流。
    理事会在关于“殖民主义问题”的决议中指责“殖民主义者继续执行种族歧视政策”。决议指责殖民主义者拒绝接受马来亚和塞浦路斯自由运动所提出的关于通过和平谈判来解决问题的建议。决议要求在尊重人民的自由和独立权利的基础上举行新的谈判。
    理事会通过另一个决议，支持尼赫鲁总理所提出的关于解决阿尔及利亚问题的五点方案，并且号召印度人民举行“阿尔及利亚日”支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族独立运动。
