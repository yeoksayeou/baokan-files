Xinhua News Agency, June 13th -- Most of the early rice on over 100 million mu of double-season rice fields across the country is already pregnant with ears. In areas with earlier seasons such as the Chaoshan Plain in Guangdong and the southern part of the Leizhou Peninsula, double-season early rice is generally flowering and heading, some is already ripening, and some has begun to be harvested.

This year, the field management of double-season early rice in various places has been better than in previous years. In most areas, the early rice has undergone two to three times of cultivation and weeding, and in some areas, the cultivation and weeding work has reached four to five times. In terms of fertilization, in addition to the sufficient base fertilizer applied before transplanting in various places, topdressing has also been carried out once or twice according to the growth of the rice. Coupled with the abundant rainfall this year and the good irrigation conditions brought about by the large number of farmland water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring, the rice has grown very well. According to farmers in various places, the characteristic of this year's double-season early rice is that it buds long, heads uniformly, and the grains are full. If there are no major natural disasters, a bumper harvest is basically a certainty. At present, the sowing of mid-season rice has mostly ended in various places, and late-season rice seedlings are being actively cultivated, striving to sow around the time of the Grain in Ear (芒种).

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 13th -- More than 16 million mu of winter wheat in Shanxi Province has generally had a bumper harvest this year. In the Jinan area, which accounts for more than 60% of the province's wheat fields, according to the actual harvesting results of some agricultural cooperatives, the average yield per mu can be 140 jin, an increase of 18% over last year. The average yield per mu in the Yuci area will reach about 124 jin, an increase of about 55% over last year. The mountainous areas of Changzhi Prefecture can produce an average of 123 jin per mu.

Agricultural cooperative members in the Jinan and Jinzhong plains, where there are the most wheat fields, are now harvesting busily. High-yield records of around 1,000 jin per mu have appeared in Ruicheng, Xieyu, Wenxi, and Yongji counties in the Yellow River Delta.

Our newspaper, Urumqi, June 13th -- A bumper wheat harvest is in sight north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. In the southern Xinjiang region, the wheat ears are drooping, and the wheat grains are full. It is estimated that the average yield per mu of wheat fields in the entire region can be increased by 21 jin compared with last year. Among them, the 670,000 mu of wheat in the Hotan region, which matures earlier, is estimated to yield 240 jin per mu, an increase of 20% over last year. The wheat in the Manas River basin, the Yili River Valley, and the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture north of the Tianshan Mountains has also begun to flower and fill. Although some of the 380,000 mu of wheat fields sown by the agricultural production and construction corps of the Xinjiang Military Region north and south of the Tianshan Mountains were hit by hail, they can still obtain a good harvest.

    全国一亿多亩双季早稻大部含苞抽穗
    山西小麦普遍丰收，天山南北地区麦田增产在望
    新华社13日讯　全国一万万多亩双季稻的早稻大部已经孕穗了。在季节较早的广东潮汕平原和雷州半岛南部等地区，双季早稻普遍扬花吐穗，有的已经黄熟，部分的开始收割。
    今年各地双季早稻的田间管理工作做得比往年好，大部地区的早稻，都经过两次到三次中耕除草工作，有些地区的中耕除草工作达到四次到五次。在施肥方面，各地在插秧前除施的基肥都比过去充足外，并且还根据稻禾的生长情况进行了一次到两次的追肥。加上今年雨水充沛和去冬今春兴修的大量农田水利工程带来的良好灌溉条件，因此使稻禾生长得非常好，据各地农民反映，今年双季早稻的特点是含苞长，出穗齐，谷粒饱满。如果没有特大的自然灾害，丰收基本已成定局。目前，各地中稻播种已经大部结束，正在积极进行晚稻育秧，争取在芒种前后播种。
    新华社太原13日电　山西省今年一千六百多万亩冬小麦普遍丰收。占全省麦田60％以上的晋南地区，根据某些农业社实际收打结果，每亩平均可产一百四十斤，比去年增产18％。榆次专区的每亩产量将可达到一百二十四斤，比去年增产55％左右。长治专区山地每亩平均可产一百二十三斤。
    现在麦田最多的晋南和晋中平原的农业社社员正在紧张收割。黄河三角地带的芮城、解虞、闻喜和永济等县都出现了亩产千斤左右的高产纪录。
    本报乌鲁木齐13日电　天山南北的小麦丰收在望。南疆地区的麦田，麦穗垂黄，麦粒饱满。估计全区每亩麦田平均可比去年增产二十一斤，其中成熟较早的和阗专区六十七万亩小麦估计每亩可收二百四十斤，比去年增产20％。天山以北的玛纳斯河流域，伊犁河谷和昌吉回族自治州的小麦也已经扬花灌浆。新疆军区农业生产建设部队播种在天山南北的三十八万亩麦田虽然有一部分遭受了冰雹袭击，仍然可以获得较好的收成。
