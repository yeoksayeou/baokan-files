The special handicraft of Shucheng County, Anhui Province – the Shu mat – is a favorite way for people to stay cool in the summer.

The production of Shu mats is now carried out by a Shu mat production cooperative consisting of more than ninety people. With summer approaching, the members are working hard to weave a large number of Shu mats. To participate in the National Handicraft Exhibition, they recently wove three top-quality Shu mats. One mat was woven by Zhang Yu, a 23-year-old young mat weaver, and it is extremely delicate. Every inch of width contains twenty-eight bamboo strips, and it is woven with a Tiananmen pattern and a five-pointed star radiating golden light. Another Shu mat was woven by Pan Xiaoben, a young mat weaver who had only been learning for eleven months. The Kremlin in Moscow, woven on the mat, looks three-dimensional under the light: viewed from the left, the Kremlin's bell tower is dark green, but viewed from the right, it turns white. However, when you touch it, there is no concave or convex feel, and no color has been applied. The last mat was woven by the master craftsman Shao Wenjun. On this Shu mat, the peace doves on Tiananmen Square, woven with bamboo strips, are as lifelike as if they were about to take flight, and the feathers on the doves are as realistic as the doves in famous paintings. This kind of finely handcrafted Shu mat demonstrates the amazing wisdom and high artistic skills of the mat weavers.

The history of Shu mats is very long, and people began weaving them at the end of the Ming Dynasty. They are made from water bamboo that is even, smooth, and the same thickness from top to bottom. After many meticulous procedures such as splitting the bamboo, tearing the culms, scraping the strips, weaving, and hemming, the mats are not only smooth, cool, sweat-wicking, and never infested with insects, but also because the strips are scraped evenly and softly, they can be folded into small rolls of five or six inches long for easy carrying. These Shu mats are also very durable, and if properly preserved, they can last for forty or fifty years. Because Shu mats have so many advantages, they have long been sold in major cities across the country, as well as in the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, Japan, and Southeast Asia.

Before liberation, the master craftsmen who wove these Shu mats were afraid that "teaching apprentices would starve the master," and most were unwilling to teach their true skills to apprentices. In addition, the lives of the mat weavers were too hard, so the production of Shu mats became less and less, and the quality deteriorated. In the early days of liberation, there were only five master craftsmen in the entire county who knew how to weave Shu mats, and they could only produce about two hundred mats a year at most.

After liberation, especially after the establishment of the Shu Mat Production Cooperative, the master craftsmen's lives were guaranteed, and they made public the mat weaving techniques that they had kept secret for many years. Liang Shoudao, a master craftsman with more than twenty years of weaving experience, weaves the edges of the mats the most evenly and straightly. Yang Chunjie, a sixty-year-old master craftsman, scrapes the strips the best. In his hands, a bamboo strip can be scraped as thin and fine as hemp fibers. In the past, they were unwilling to teach their skills to others, and sometimes they hid in their rooms to work for fear of being learned by others. However, now, new trainees who have been patiently taught by them can weave mats in just one month. In order to improve production efficiency and quality, the master craftsmen have also created triangular scrapers and semi-mechanized mat weaving platforms. Master craftsmen are not only respected for their skills, but some have also joined the Communist Party, and some have also become members of the Shucheng County People's Committee.

    人们喜爱的消暑用具——舒席
    木杉
    安徽省舒城县的特种手工艺品——舒席，是人们喜爱的夏季消暑用具。
    现在生产舒席的，是一个九十多人组成的舒席生产合作社。夏季到了，社员们正在紧张地编制大批舒席。为了参加全国手工业展览会，最近他们还编了三床上等舒席。一床是由二十三岁的青年席工张禹编制的，样子非常精细，每寸宽的面积可容纳二十八竹篾，上面编有天安门花纹和发射着金光的五角星。另一床舒席是仅仅学了十一个月的青年席工潘孝本编制的。席子上编的苏联克里姆林宫，在灯光下看去，好像立体的一样：从左边望去克里姆林宫的钟楼是墨绿色的，从右边望去却成了白色，等你用手摸摸又没有任何凹凸感觉，也没有涂上一点颜色。还有一床是老师傅邵文俊编的。这床舒席上，那用竹篾匹编成的天安门上的和平鸽子就跟活的一样展翅欲飞，鸽子身上的羽毛和名画上的鸽子一样逼真。这种手工精细的舒席，表现了席工们惊人的智慧和高度的艺术技巧。
    舒席的历史很悠久，在明朝末年就开始有人编制。它是利用节平、光滑、上下一样粗细的水竹，经过破竹、撕杆、刮篾、编制、收边等许多手续精工编制出来的，它不仅有光滑、凉爽、走汗和永不生虫等优点，同时因为篾子刮的匀、柔软，还可以折成五、六寸长的小卷随身携带。这种舒席也很耐用，如果保存得好，可以用上四、五十年。由于舒席具备这么多优点，很早以前就畅销国内各大城市，苏联、人民民主国家和日本、南洋一带。
    解放以前，编这种舒席的老师傅怕“教会徒弟饿死师傅”，大都不愿把自己真正的技术教给学徒，加上编席工人生活太苦，因此编舒席的产量就越来越少，而且质量越来越差。解放初期，全县会编舒席的只有五个老师傅，每年最多只能出产二百来床。
    解放后，特别是建立了舒席生产合作社以后，老师傅们生活有保障了，也把保守多年的编席技术公开了。有二十多年编席经验的老师傅梁守道编席子边收得最匀最直。六十岁的老师傅杨春杰篾刮得最好，一根篾匹经他的手，能刮得跟麻片一样的细和薄。过去他们不愿意把技术教给别人，有时因为怕被别人学去，就躲在房里做。可是，现在经他们耐心教过的新学员，只要一个月就可以编席。为了提高生产效率和质量，老师傅们还创造了三角刮刀和半机械化的编席台。老师傅不光在技术上受到人尊敬，有的还参加了共产党，也有的当了舒城县人民委员会的委员。
