Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Mei Ru'ao, delegate to the National People's Congress, former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and Chinese expert in international law, today issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the handling of Japanese war criminals.

Mei Ru'ao said: The decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress regarding the handling of Japanese war criminals is correct, and the recent verdicts of the Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court on the seventeen Japanese war criminals are also correct. I fully agree. Without a doubt, the Chinese government's handling of Japanese war criminals is stern, and at the same time, very lenient. Not only can the vast majority of Japanese war criminals in custody, whose crimes are relatively minor and who have shown good signs of repentance, be exempted from prosecution and released to return home, but even the small number whose crimes are serious and who are brought to trial will receive lenient sentences. The recent verdicts announced by our Special Military Tribunal did not impose the death penalty on them, nor did they impose life imprisonment; only fixed-term imprisonment of varying lengths was given. Even these few war criminals sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment may be released early in the future if they show good behavior. This lenient treatment is a manifestation of the great magnanimity and high humanitarian spirit of the People's China. At the same time, it is also in line with the interests of the Chinese and Japanese people and the interests of peace in the Far East and the world. Such an unprecedented thing can only be done by the victorious Chinese people.

Mei Ru'ao said: One point that must be pointed out is that although our sentences for Japanese war criminals are very lenient this time, the judgments were made very solemnly. They all went through meticulous investigation and fair trials. Not only were there complete testimonies and material evidence, but the defendants also had full opportunity to defend themselves. Such trial procedures are fully in line with international practice and international law. It is based on the spirit of humanitarianism and also takes into account the requirements of legal justice.

Mei Ru'ao then said: There is no need to shy away from the fact that the debt of blood owed to our people by Japanese imperialists over the past sixty years is indeed uncountable. The crimes they committed in China are countless. The long-term aggression of Japanese imperialism caused extremely heavy losses to the lives and property of the Chinese people. Without going into distant matters, just from the time Japan launched its full-scale war of aggression against China in 1937 until Japan's surrender in 1945, in these eight years alone, the loss of life and property suffered by the Chinese people was incalculable. In the six weeks after the fall of Nanjing in the winter of 1937, the number of Chinese people slaughtered, which was considered by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East as conclusive evidence and verifiable records, was over 200,000, all of whom were unarmed civilians, most of whom were the elderly, women, and children. When Chinese people mention these appalling atrocities committed by Japanese war criminals, they cannot help but feel deep-seated hatred.

However, Mei Ru'ao said, more than ten years have passed since then. In these ten years, the international situation and Sino-Japanese relations have undergone fundamental changes. Now, the Japanese war criminals detained in our country are not the main perpetrators of the Japanese imperialist war of aggression, and during their long detention, the vast majority of them have had varying degrees of awareness and transformation. Under these circumstances, we can adopt a lenient approach towards them. "Do not dwell on past grievances" and "treat people with kindness" are the traditional virtues of the Chinese people. China and Japan are neighbors. For the long-term interests of peace, we should focus on the future, not just the past.

This treatment of ours demonstrates the extreme magnanimity of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people and their sincere desire to cooperate with them in friendship and coexist peacefully.

Mei Ru'ao finally said: In general, the Chinese government's lenient measures will not only not cause any harm to enhancing Sino-Japanese friendship and safeguarding peace in the Far East, but will also have a certain beneficial impact. At the same time, such treatment will also have a certain beneficial impact on further easing the international situation and further combating war conspiracies.

    我国国际法学家梅汝璈发表谈话说
    对日本战犯的判处是严正的宽大的
    据新华社22日讯　全国人民代表大会代表、前远东国际军事法庭法官、我国国际法学家梅汝璈，今天就日本战争犯罪分子的处理问题向新华社记者发表谈话。
    梅汝璈说：全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于处理日本战争犯罪分子的决定是正确的，最近最高人民法院特别军事法庭对于十七名日本战争犯罪分子的判决也是正确的，本人完全同意。毫无疑义，中国政府对日本战争犯罪分子的处理是严正的，同时也是非常宽大的。不但对于极大部分在押的日本战争犯罪分子中罪行较轻和悔罪表现较好的可以免予起诉、释放回国，而且就是那少数罪行严重、交付审判的分子也将获得从宽判处。我国特别军事法庭最近宣布的判决对他们不但没有判处死刑，而且也没有判处无期徒刑；仅仅判处了不同年限的有期徒刑。就是这少数被判处有期徒刑的战争犯罪分子，如果有良好的表现，将来也可以获得提前释放。这种宽大的处理是人民中国伟大胸襟和高度人道主义精神的表现。同时，它也是符合中日两国人民的利益和远东及世界和平的利益的。这种史无前例的事情只有胜利了的中国人民才有气魄做得出来。
    梅汝璈说：必须指出的一点是，我们这次对日本战争犯罪分子的判决虽是十分宽大的，但是作出这些判决却是十分郑重的。它们都是经过缜密的侦查、公正的审讯的。不但人证物证俱全，而且被告都获有充分辩护的机会。这样的审判程序是完全符合国际惯例和国际法准则的。它是本着人道主义的精神，同时也照顾到法律正义的要求的。
    梅汝璈接着说：不必讳言，六十年来日本帝国主义者对我国人民所欠下的血债确实是算不清的。他们在中国所犯的罪行是数不胜数、书不胜书的。日本帝国主义者的长期侵略，使中国人民的生命财产遭受着极其惨重的损失。远的且不谈，只就1937年日本发动全面侵华战争起到1945年日本投降止，仅在这八年之中，我国人民所遭受的生命损失，财产损失价值是难以数计的。1937年冬南京沦陷后六个星期里，经远东国际军事法庭认为证据确凿、有案可稽的被屠杀的中国人民就在二十万人以上，全部都是手无寸铁的平民，其中大多数是老年人、妇女和儿童。对日本战争罪犯们的这些骇人听闻的暴行，中国人提起来是没有不切齿痛恨的。
    但是，梅汝璈说，事情已经过去十年以上了，在这十年中，国际局势和中日关系已经起了根本的变化，现在，在我国羁押的日本战犯并不是发动日本帝国主义侵略战争的主要责任者，而且他们在长期羁押期间，极大多数都有不同程度的觉悟和转变。在这种情形之下，我们是可以对他们采取宽大处理的。“不念旧恶”“与人为善”是中国人民的传统美德。中国和日本是近邻，为了和平的长远利益，我们应该着重看到未来，而不要只看到过去。
    我们这种处理表示着中国人民对日本人民的极端旷达的胸怀和愿意同他们友好合作、和平共处的真诚愿望。
    梅汝璈最后说：总的说来，我国政府的宽大措施，对于增进中日友好和保卫远东和平不但不会带来丝毫损害。而且会产生一定有利的影响。同时，这样处理对于进一步地和缓国际局势和进一步地打击战争阴谋，也会产生一定有利的影响。
