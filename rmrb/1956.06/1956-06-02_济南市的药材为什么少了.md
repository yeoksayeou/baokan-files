Why are there fewer medicinal materials in Jinan?
    Zhang Baoyi
    Jinan, known as one of the eight major medicinal material markets in the country, held its annual medicinal material conference as usual this year. However, from April 30th to May 14th, only over 240,000 jin of medicinal materials were put on the market, which is a little more than half of the amount put on the market at last year's medicinal material conference. This is the year with the smallest amount of medicinal materials on the market in the last four or five years.
    Why has the amount of medicinal materials on the market decreased so much?
    From last autumn to this spring, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions concentrated their main efforts on agricultural production and basic construction such as farmland water conservancy, neglecting sideline production. Some district and township staff and agricultural production cooperatives even adopted the wrong practice of restricting farmers from planting and collecting medicinal materials. Let's listen to the voices of the medicinal material farmers at this medicinal material conference.
    Zhang Fengyi from Laotun, Jinan suburban three districts, said: "I am seventy-two years old this year, and I have been planting *diding* (堇菜) since I was eighteen. In the past, I would bring a large number of *diding* here, but this year is the last time. Because the cooperative does not allow planting *diding*. If I set aside two *mu* of land to plant *diding*, I cannot join the cooperative. I cannot fail to take the socialist road because of planting two *mu* of *diding*!"
    Ma Yuanshui from Sanyizhuang, Licheng County, said that their cooperative stipulates: the same labor force gets ten work points for doing farm work, but only six work points for collecting medicinal materials. Collecting medicine for a day requires paying the cooperative eight *jiao*, and sometimes you can't even get eight *jiao* a day from self-collection and self-sale. Therefore, more than 100 people came to sell medicine from Sanyizhuang last year, but only 15 people came this year.
    A medicinal material farmer from Tai'an County said: "Although Mount Tai is a place rich in Chinese medicine, this year, for fear of destroying the mountains and forests, the mountains have been closed off. We certainly support closing the mountains for afforestation, but if we are not allowed to collect or plant medicinal materials at all, what will we do, we who rely on the mountains for our livelihood? We can only secretly go to collect medicinal materials, and if we are found out by the cooperative, we have to hand over the medicine to the cooperative as investment."
    Wang Xilian from Gongcun, Licheng County, said: "In the past, collecting and planting medicinal materials was a major sideline income for the farmers in our village; this year, the cooperative only pays attention to increasing grain production and does not value the production of Chinese medicine. Some staff members even say that collecting medicine is developing capitalism. Now, some members would rather be idle than go to collect medicine!"
    Hao Guanglu from Xujiazhuang, Zhangqiu County, suggested to the Provincial People's Committee that district, township, and agricultural cooperative leaders should also include the collection of medicinal materials and other sideline production in the cooperative's production plan, and not restrict farmers from collecting and planting medicinal materials.
    The phenomenon of not allowing farmers to go up the mountains to collect medicine and restricting farmers from planting medicine began to occur in the second half of last year. Staff members of the former Kunyushan Eleventh District Office said that planting *shashen* (沙参, Glehnia root) was "developing capitalism." Therefore, some farmers dug up more than 30 *mu* of *shashen* that had already been planted and changed to planting grain crops. In the mountainous area of ​​Pingyi County, it is said that last year, for fear that collecting medicinal materials would damage the forest land, farmers were strictly prohibited from entering the mountains to collect medicinal materials. However, farmers took the opportunity to flock into the mountains to collect medicinal materials. As a result, more than 3,000 *mu* of forest land was trampled, and more than 150,000 *Pinus massoniana* trees were trampled to death. If areas are designated in advance and farmers are organized to collect medicinal materials in a planned way, the phenomenon of destroying forest land can be completely avoided.
    During the Jinan Medicinal Material Conference, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee has issued instructions, requiring people's committees at all levels in medicinal material producing areas to promptly lift all restrictions on farmers' planting and collecting medicinal materials and encourage farmers to actively engage in medicinal material production.

    济南市的药材为什么少了
    张保义
    号称全国八大药市之一的济南市，今年照例举行了药材大会。但是，从四月三十日到五月十四日，上市药材仅有二十四万多斤，为去年药材大会上市量的一半多一点。这是最近四、五年来药材上市量最少的一年。
    为什么药材上市量大大减少了呢？
    去年秋冬到今春，各地农业生产合作社集中主要力量投入农业生产和农田水利等基本建设，忽视了副业生产，有些区、乡工作人员和农业生产合作社，甚至采取了限制农民种药、采药的错误做法。我们听一听这次药材大会上药农的呼声吧。
    济南市郊三区老屯张凤义说：“我今年七十二岁了，从十八岁就种地丁。往年都要带着大批地丁来到这里，可是，今年是最后一次了。因为社里不让种地丁，要是自己留出二亩地来种地丁，那就不能入社。我不能因为种两亩地丁而不走社会主义道路啊！”
    历城县三义庄马元水说，他们社里规定：一样的劳动力干农活给十分工，采药只给六分工。采药一天，得向社里缴八角钱，自采自卖一天有时还得不到八角钱。因此，三义庄去年来卖药的有一百多人，今年只来十五人。
    泰安县的一位药农说：“泰山虽然是盛产中药的地方，可是今年怕破坏山林，把山封起来了。封山造林我们当然拥护，但是根本不让采药、种药，我们靠山吃饭的人怎么办呢？我们只有偷着去采药，要是被社里查出来，还得把药交到社里当投资。”
    历城县宫村王喜莲说：“过去采药、种药是俺村农民一项很大的副业收入；今年社里光注意增产粮食，不重视中药生产，有的工作人员甚至说采药是发展资本主义，现在，一些社员宁愿闲着，也不肯去采药了！”
    章丘县徐家庄郝光禄向省人民委员会提出建议说，应该让区、乡和农业合作社的领导人员把采药和其它副业生产也安排在合作社的生产计划里，不要限制农民采药、种药。
    不允许农民上山采药和限制农民种药的现象，去年下半年就开始发生了。前昆嵛县十一区区公所的工作人员说，种沙参是“发展资本主义”，因此，有些农民把三十多亩已经种上的沙参刨掉，改种粮食作物。在平邑县山区，据说去年怕采药破坏了林地，严格禁止农民进山采药，可是农民乘机涌入山上采药，结果，反而踏坏了三千多亩林地，光是马尾松就被踏死了十五万多株。如果事先划定地区，有计划地组织农民去采药，毁坏山林地的现象是完全可以避免的。
    在济南市药材大会期间，山东省人民委员会已经发出了指示，要求药材产区各级人民委员会，迅速取消对于农民种药采药的各种限制，鼓励农民积极从事药材生产。
