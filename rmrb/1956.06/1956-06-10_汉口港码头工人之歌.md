Xinhua News Agency Report: Xinhua News Agency reporter Yao Changgan reported: Among the dockworkers in the Hankou port area of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, a folk song describing their working lives has recently become popular: "In the past, we carried it on our shoulders; yesterday, we pulled it along (referring to pulling trolleys); today, we walk alongside it (referring to operating electric forklifts); tomorrow, we will sit and operate it (referring to sitting and operating electric universal loaders)."

In the past two years, this port, which has always relied on manual loading and unloading, has seen more and more new machinery: the long arms of cranes extend over the river; long belt conveyors and chain conveyors have been installed on the docks; brand-new universal loaders, electric forklifts, heavy-duty trucks, and rail flatcars are active on the shore. Every day, when cargo ships dock at the port, these machines start working, replacing dockworkers in some of the strenuous loading and unloading labor. The deep "heave-ho, heave-ho" sounds that have always resonated in the docks for years are now gradually drowned out by the grand chorus of motors and machinery.

So far, the processes of lifting, unloading, transferring, and stacking of some packaged and small boxed goods such as grain, cotton yarn, tea, and soap, as well as coal from the shore warehouses to the ship's hold, can almost all be operated by machinery; the lifting and unloading of the heaviest steel objects on the shore has also been replaced by universal loaders and rail flatcars. Port technicians are creating a chute and cable car to facilitate the handling of steel objects up and down slopes, so that this transportation work, which is as dangerous as walking a plank road in the dry season of the Yangtze River, can also be gradually mechanized.

### 汉口港码头工人之歌

    汉口港码头工人之歌
    据新华社讯　新华社记者姚昌淦报道：在长江中游汉口港区的一些码头工人中，近来流行着这样一首描述他们劳动生活的歌谣：“过去我们是扛着走，昨天我们是拉着走（指拉板车），今天我们是站着走（指站着操纵电动搬运车），明天我们是坐着走（指坐着操纵电动万能装卸机）。”
    最近两年多以来，这个一向是人工装卸的港口，出现了越来越多的新机械：江边伸出了一只只起重机的长臂；码头上安设了长长的皮带运输机和链板运输机；岸上活跃着崭新的万能装卸机、电动搬运车、载重汽车，以及轨道平车。每天，当货船泊进港口的时候，这些机械就开始忙碌起来，代替码头工人进行一部分费力的装卸劳动。多少年来一直震撼码头的深沉的“哼唷、哼唷”的声音，现在渐渐地淹没在马达和机械的大合唱里了。
    到目前为止，粮食、棉纱、茶叶、肥皂等一部分包装和小型箱装货物，以及煤炭从岸上仓库到船舱之间的起、卸、转、堆等过程，差不多全部可以使用机械操作；最为笨重的钢铁物件的起卸工作，在岸上也由万能装卸机和轨道平车代替了。港口技术人员们正在创设一种便于钢铁物件上下坡用的滑道和缆车，使这个在长江枯水季节艰险如履栈道的搬运工作，也逐步机械化。
