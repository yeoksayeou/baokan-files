Since the Second Session of the National People's Congress last year, although it has been less than a year, our country has undergone great changes under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Since the second half of last year, agricultural cooperativization has entered a high tide; the socialist transformation of capitalist industry, commerce, and handicrafts has also unfolded with overwhelming momentum; the state has also made appropriate arrangements for intellectuals, expecting them to exert their strength to build the motherland; this year, the State Council established the Scientific Planning Commission, inviting scientists from all over the country to make a twelve-year plan for scientific development. All this shows that New China is advancing rapidly on the socialist road. In this meeting, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report on the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress all fully demonstrate the great progress of our country. I have studied these reports, especially since I participated in the Budget Committee of the National People's Congress, I have made specific research on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget and participated in repeated discussions. I believe that these reports fully demonstrate the soundness and stability of my country's economic and financial foundation, and also prove the superiority of socialism. I fully agree with and support these three reports.

In the government, my job is in the National Bureau of Metrology, and now I will briefly report to the conference on the work in this area.

The National Bureau of Metrology was established according to the instructions of the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China," with the task of unifying the national weights and measures, establishing metrological standards, and establishing a unified verification system for measuring instruments. I will first talk about the work of unifying national weights and measures, because this is the first step in launching metrology work. This work has been prepared since shortly after the founding of the Central People's Government. What measurement system should be used to unify it? From a scientific and practical point of view, it is inevitable to use the international metric system as the measurement system to unify my country's weights and measures, and some representatives have proposed it at the Second Session of the National People's Congress. I think everyone agrees with it. However, there are several Chinese translations of the units of length, mass, and capacity in the metric system that have been used in my country in the past. Although the Kuomintang government promulgated a so-called legal name, it was opposed by many people because of its poor translation method. Not only did it not become a nationally unified name, but it formed a dispute between two sets of names from that time on. One is the name with the "gong" character as the system promulgated by the Kuomintang. That is, the names of the old units of length, mass, and capacity in our country are all prefixed with a "gong" character, such as "gongchi" (公尺 - metric meter), "gongcun" (公寸 - metric decimeter), "gongfen" (公分 - metric centimeter) for length, "gongjin" (公斤 - kilogram), "gongliang" (公两 - metric tael), "gongqian" (公钱 - metric mace), "gongfen" (公分 - metric centigram) for mass, and "gongsheng" (公升 - liter), "gonghe" (公合 - metric deciliter), "gongshao" (公勺 - metric spoon) for capacity. The other is to maintain the original naming spirit of the metric system, with meter, gram, and liter as the units of length, mass, and capacity, and then use deci, centi, milli, micro, and ten, hundred, thousand, and mega as prefixes to add before these unit names as the names of large and small units. The former translation has been applied to some industries and businesses, and the latter translation has been applied to secondary education, higher education, and scientific research. For more than 20 years, each has used its own, causing much confusion and controversy. After the founding of the Central People's Government, it attached importance to the unification work in this area. Since 1950, the Government Administration Council, the Financial and Economic Committee, and the Central Administration of Industry and Commerce have convened several symposiums with people from all walks of life and solicited opinions from provinces, cities, and departments. After the establishment of the National Bureau of Metrology, it also invited people from all walks of life to hold many symposiums. The Science and Technology Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also held two symposiums. Recently, the General Office of the State Council has held several symposiums with relevant departments. Most people believe that the former translation, the units of length and mass, have names such as "gongfen" (公分), "gongli" (公厘), and "gonghao" (公毫), which are homonyms and easily confused, and are inconvenient to use in science. Also, each unit has a name, which cannot express the relationship between advance and retreat, and cannot be applied to other physical quantities. Now a conclusion has been roughly reached, that is, to confirm that the latter translation method is simple and systematic, conforms to the spirit of the metric system, and the prefixes deci, centi, milli, micro, and ten, hundred, thousand, and mega that indicate advance and retreat do not violate Chinese habits and can be applied to other physical quantities. Only the word "qian" (千 - thousand) may be inconvenient to use (for example, one thousand times the quantity of a kilometer will inevitably become one thousand kilometers), and it is proposed to replace it with "guan" (贯). That is to say: "gongjin" (公斤) is changed to "guankeke" (贯克 - guangram), "gongchi" (公尺) is changed to "mi" (米 - meter), "gongli" (公里) is changed to "guanmi" (贯米 - guanmeter); so the commonly used units, the length will be guanmi, mi, fenmi (分米 - decimeter), limi (厘米 - centimeter), haomi (毫米 - millimeter), weimi (微米 - micrometer); the mass will be guanke, ke, haoke (毫克 - milligram); the capacity will be sheng (升 - liter), haosheng (毫升 - milliliter); applied to other physical quantities, it is like the commonly used units of electricity, the power is guanwa (贯瓦 - guanwatt), wa (瓦 - watt); the current is an (安 - ampere), haoan (毫安 - milliampere); the voltage is guanfu (贯伏 - guanvolt), fu (伏 - volt), haofu (毫伏 - millivolt). This is also the one commonly used in university education, secondary education, and the scientific community, only modifying one "guan" character. This plan has been submitted to the State Council for review. This translation method may have some unfamiliar places at the beginning of its implementation, but it will not be strange after it is commonly used.

This nomenclature problem, which is not very well-known, looks very simple, but its uncertainty directly affects the supply of new measuring instruments required for the implementation of the metric system (some large cities have organized the production of these new instruments, but they dare not manufacture them because the name has not been determined), and indirectly affects the work of promoting the metric system.

Secondly, I want to talk about the establishment of metrological standards and the establishment of a unified verification system for measuring instruments. This problem will occur immediately with the implementation of the metric system, because without the establishment of metrological standards and a unified verification system for measuring instruments, the unification of length, mass, and capacity cannot be truly achieved. However, the establishment of standards is a highly scientific work, which requires highly precise standard instruments and corresponding equipment, special buildings, and especially a large number of scientific and technical personnel, especially senior scientific and technical experts. At present, my country's metrological science is almost a blank, there are no standard equipment, and there is a great lack of talent, which affects the beginning of our entire work, because without metrological standards, there is no way to establish a unified verification system for measuring instruments.

In order to quickly establish my country's metrological science work, the most important thing is to have a large number of scientific and technical personnel, but today my bureau is extremely short of cadres, and I hope that the state will allocate some senior scientific and technical personnel and necessary college graduates. As for the instruments and equipment, because the required accuracy is extremely high, many are not ordinary mass-produced commodities. Ordering from abroad cannot be obtained in a short period of time. Now we have received the promise of help from relevant Soviet departments and are preparing to proceed concretely, but it is still difficult to quickly obtain the talents and equipment we need.

Although my bureau has been established for more than a year, everything has no achievements to speak of, and we cannot answer the metrological problems that various enterprise departments and scientific research institutions expect us to solve, which is really what my bureau apologizes for, and it is also what I am ashamed of. But we must do this work well, and I hope that the representatives and comrades of relevant departments will help us and instruct us from all aspects, and especially hope that we will give strict criticism to our work. The Soviet experts hired by my bureau are about to arrive. Under the leadership of the State Council, with the selfless help of Soviet friends, as long as we work harder, the metrology work will be established.

    我们一定要做好计量工作
    ——李承干代表的发言
    从去年全国人民代表大会第二次会议以来，虽然还不到一年，我们的国家，在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，已经发生了伟大的变化。从去年下半年起，农业合作化进入高潮；资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造亦以排山倒海的声势开展起来；国家对知识分子亦作了适当的安排，期望他们发挥力量，建设祖国；今年，国务院又成立了科学规划委员会，邀集全国科学家作了十二年科学发展的规划。这一切都说明了新中国在社会主义的大道上高速地迈进。在这次会议上，李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明以及彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，都充分表明了我们国家的伟大进步。我对于这些报告都作了研究，特别由于我参加人代会预算委员会，对1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算更作了具体的研究并参加了反复的讨论。我认为这些报告充分说明了我国经济、财政基础的健全和稳定，也证明了社会主义的优越。我完全同意并拥护这三个报告。
    在政府里，我的工作岗位是在国家计量局，现在我把这一方面的工作简略地向大会报告。
    国家计量局，是根据“中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”的指示，以统一全国度量衡，建立计量基准，和建立统一的量具、计器检校制度为它的任务的。我在这里先谈统一全国度量衡的工作，因为这是展开计量工作的第一步。这个工作，从中央人民政府成立后不久，就准备着。用什么计量制度来统一呢？从科学和我国实际情况来说，用国际米突制作为统一我国度量衡的计量制度，是必然的，而且全国人民代表大会第二次会议时已有一些代表提议过的，我想也是大家所赞同的。但是米突制的度、量、衡各单位的中文译名，过去在我国应用上有好几种，国民党政府统治时期虽然公布了一种所谓法定的名称，但因它的译名方法不善，遭到许多人反对，不仅没有成为全国一致推行的名称，而且从那时起，就形成了两套名称的争论。一种是国民党所公布的以“公”字为系统的名称。即是沿用我国旧有的度、量、衡、单位的名称，一律在前面加上一个“公”字，例如长度的公尺、公寸、公分，质量的公斤、公两、公钱、公分，容量的公升、公合、公勺等。另一种是保持米突制原来的命名精神，以米、克、升、作为长度、质量、容量的单位，再以分、厘、毫、微和十、百、千、兆等作为进退的词冠，附加在这些单位名称之前作为大小单位名称。前一种译名，已应用于一部分工商业，后一种译名，已应用于中等教育、高等教育和科学研究上，二十多年来，各用各的，造成许多混乱和争论。中央人民政府成立后，重视这一方面的统一工作，从1950年起，政务院、财经委员会、中央工商行政管理局都曾召集各方面人士开过好几次座谈会，征求过各省、市、各部门的意见；国家计量局成立后，又邀集了各方面人士座谈好多次；政协全国委员会科学技术组也开过两次座谈会；最近，国务院秘书厅又开过有关部门的座谈会几次。大多数人士认为前一种译名，长度和质量的单位，都有“公分”“公厘”“公毫”等名称，异物同名，容易混淆，在科学上使用不便；又每个单位，有一个名称，既不能表示进退关系，而且不能适用于其他物理量。现在已大致得到结论，即确认后一种译法简单而有系统合乎米突制的精神，表示进退的分、厘、毫、微和十、百、千、兆等词冠，也不违中国的习惯而且可以应用到其他物理量上去。只有“千”字用起来可能不便（例如千米这个量的一千倍势必成为一千千米），拟用贯字代替。也就是说：“公斤”改为“贯克”，“公尺”改为“米”，“公里”改为“贯米”；这样常用各单位，长度的就为贯米、米、分米、厘米、毫米、微米；质量的，就为贯克、克、毫克；容量的就为升、毫升等；应用到其他物理量，就如电气的常用单位，功率为贯瓦、瓦；电流为安、毫安；电压为贯伏、伏、毫伏等。这也就是现在大学教育、中等教育和科学界所通用而只修改一个“贯”字的。这个方案，已提请国务院审核。这个译名法，在推行之初，可能有不习惯的地方，但常用之后也可不奇怪了。
    这个不大为人注意的名词问题，看起来很简单，但它的不确定，直接影响了推行米突制所需新的量具计器的供应（若干大城市已组织了这些新器具的生产，但因名称未定，不敢制造），间接就影响推行米突制工作。
    其次我要谈建立计量基准工作和建立统一的量具计器检校制度的问题。这问题是随着米突制的推行立刻就要发生的，因为没有计量基准和统一的量具计器检校制度的建立，度、量、衡是谈不到真正统一的。但建立基准是高度的科学工作，它需要高度精密的基准器和相应的设备，需要特殊的建筑，尤需要大量的科学技术人材，特别是高级的科学技术专家。目前我国的计量科学几乎还是一个空白，基准设备还没有，人材很缺乏，这就影响了我们整个工作的开始，因为没有计量基准，亦谈不到建立统一的量具计器检校制度。
    为了迅速建立我国的计量科学工作，最重要的，是须有大批科学技术人员，但今天我局干部极缺，希望国家调配一些高级科学技术人员和必要的大专毕业学生。至于仪器设备，因为所需精度极高，很多不是普通大量生产的商品，向国外订购，不是短期间可以得到，现在得到苏联有关部门答应帮助，正在准备具体进行中，但要很快得到我们所需的人材和设备还是很难的。
    我局成立虽已过一年，但一切都无成绩可言，对各企业部门和科学研究机构所期望我们解决的计量问题无法答复，这实在是我局所抱歉的，也是我引为惭愧的。但我们一定要搞好这一工作，希望各位代表和有关部门的同志们从一切方面帮助我们，指示我们，尤希望对我们的工作给以严格的批评。我局所聘请的苏联顾问快要到来，在国务院的领导下，有苏联友人无私的帮助，只要我们加倍努力，计量工作是会建立起来的。
