    Sunday concerts, systematically organized by the Central Song and Dance Troupe since March 31st, have played a definite role in enlivening Beijing's musical life and strengthening the artistic practice of musicians. These concerts, employing diverse forms such as vocal music, orchestral music, chamber music, as well as folk music and folk songs, and programs rich in content, are able to attract a wide range of music lovers with different interests and satisfy their needs on a larger scale.
    Conducting regular musical performance activities in a planned manner allows singers and instrumentalists to clearly understand their performance tasks during this period, and to have sufficient time and mental preparation for artistic creation. In the past, due to the unplanned and chaotic state of music performance organization, artists were often placed in a passive position, making it difficult to effectively grasp and arrange their performance life; many artists longed to meet with the masses but had no opportunity, and some artists did not even know they had a performance task until the day before the performance. This unreasonable phenomenon inevitably affected the artistic creation of artists. Now, from the Central Song and Dance Troupe's Sunday concerts, we can see that many artists, due to frequent meetings with the masses in planned performances, have increased their enthusiasm for work and continuously improved their performance level. At the same time, a group of young actors has also been cultivated through these performance practices. For example, young female singer Chen Yan and male singer Yu Qingwu are both good actors who have emerged from these musical activities.
    Normal performance activities have also promoted the development of musical creation activities. According to statistics from the Central Song and Dance Troupe's previous music programs, the number of songs performed in various forms has reached 104, of which more than half are newly rehearsed programs, and many are recent new works by composers. For example, Ma Sicong's "Huai River Chorus," Xie Gongcheng's "Yangtze River Chorus," and some instrumental pieces, such as Li Weicai's "Chinese Folk Song Suite," Ma Sicong's "Song of the Forest," Liu Shouyi's "Suona Concerto" (Celebrating Victory), etc. These new works have all been welcomed by the audience. The works of many young composers have also appeared on the concert program. It can be said that in every vocal and orchestral concert, we can hear many new works, which is very exciting. Performing groups are always the bridge between composers and audiences. Only by continuously strengthening performance practice can musical works play their due social role and promote the prosperity of musical creation activities.
    Sunday concerts have also done a lot of work in introducing foreign works. Among the 104 vocal works, there are 51 foreign works. From a quantitative point of view, its proportion is slightly excessive, but it is worth noting that, except for one Indian song sung in the original language, all the remaining 50 songs have been translated and adapted into Chinese for singing. This practice should be welcomed.
    It is very gratifying that the Central Song and Dance Troupe can actively carry out Sunday concert performances in the past when performance programs were relatively scarce and there was a lack of regular public performance habits. Only by constantly considering the needs of the masses, closely connecting with the masses, and sincerely serving the masses can artists create genuine achievements and shine with sparks in artistic creation.

    受首都听众欢迎的星期音乐会
    叶林
    中央歌舞团自三月三十一日起有计划地举办的星期音乐会，对于活跃首都的音乐生活，加强音乐家的艺术实践，是有一定作用的。这些音乐会，采用了声乐、管弦乐、室内乐、以及民乐和民歌等多种形式和内容丰富的节目，所以能够吸引趣味不同的广大音乐爱好者，并且在较大的范围内满足他们的需要。
    有计划地进行经常化的音乐演出活动，可以使演唱、演奏家们能够清楚地知道自己在这一段时间的演出任务，而能有充分的时间和思想准备进行艺术创作。过去，由于音乐演出的组织工作处在无计划的混乱状态，艺术家们常常陷于被动，很难切实掌握和安排自己的演出生活；许多艺术家渴望和群众见面而没有机会，有的艺术家甚至在演出的前一天还不知道有演出任务。这种不合理的现象，不可避免地会影响艺术家的艺术创造。现在，从中央歌舞团的星期音乐会，我们可以看到，许多艺术家由于在有计划的演出中经常和群众见面，工作的劲头大了，演出水平也不断提高了。同时，通过这些演出实践，还培养了一批年青的演员。像青年女歌唱家陈嫣和男歌唱家郁庆五，都是在这次音乐活动中才涌现出来的好演员。
    正常的演出活动，也推动了音乐创作活动的开展。根据中央歌舞团前几次音乐节目的统计，演出各种形式的歌曲数量已达到了104首，其中有半数以上都是新排的节目，有许多还是作曲家们最近的新作。例如马思聪的“淮河大合唱”，谢功成的“长江大合唱”，以及一些器乐曲，如李伟才的“中国民歌组曲”、马思聪的“山林之歌”、刘守义等的“唢呐协奏曲”（欢庆胜利）等。这些新作品都受到听众的欢迎。不少青年作曲家的作品也出现在音乐会的节目单上。可以说，在每一次声乐和管弦乐音乐会中，我们都能够听到许多新作品，这种现象是十分令人兴奋的。演出团体永远是作曲家和观众的桥梁，只有不断地加强演出实践，才能使音乐作品发挥它应有的社会作用，才能促进音乐创作活动的繁荣。
    星期音乐会对外国作品的介绍也做了许多工作。在104首声乐作品中，外国的作品有五十一首。从数量上看，它的比重是稍嫌过多些，但值得注意的是，这些作品除了有一首印度歌曲是用原文歌唱以外，其余的五十首全都译配为中文演唱。这种做法是应该欢迎的。
    中央歌舞团能在过去演出节目比较贫乏和缺乏经常性公演习惯的情况下，积极地开展星期音乐会的演出活动，这是非常可喜的事。艺术家只有经常考虑到群众的需要，和群众密切联系，真心诚意地为群众服务，才会创造出真正的成绩，才能够在艺术创造中闪耀出火花。
