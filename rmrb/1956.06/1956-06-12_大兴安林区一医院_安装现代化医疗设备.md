Xinhua News Agency, Tu Lihe, 9th. The First Central Hospital of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Bureau, located in the Daxinganling Forest in the bank of the Tu Li River, began installing various electrical medical equipment on June 7th. These equipments are: Czechoslovakian-produced large-scale X-ray machine for both photography and fluoroscopy, sun lamps, ultra-short wave electrotherapy machine, electric refrigerators and other new medical machinery.

The Daxinganling Forestry Area is one of China's major timber supply bases. Tens of thousands of residents already live here. In the past, because the hospitals in the forestry area lacked modern medical equipment, workers and their families often could not receive treatment locally after becoming ill, and every month there were always fifty or sixty patients who had to travel long distances to seek medical treatment elsewhere.

    大兴安林区一医院
    安装现代化医疗设备
    新华社图里河9日电　在大兴安岭森林中，在图里河畔的内蒙古森林工业管理局第一中心医院，六月七日开始安装各种电气医疗设备。这些设备是：捷克斯洛伐克出产的照像和透视兼用的大型爱克司光机，太阳灯，超短波电疗机，电气冰箱等新式医疗机械。
    大兴安岭林区是我国主要木材供应基地之一。这里已经有几万居民居住。过去，由于林区各个医院都缺少现代化的医疗设备，工人们和他们的家属得病后，往往不能在当地治疗，每月总有五、六十个病人到外地远途就医。
