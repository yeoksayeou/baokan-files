    The Acquisition of Members' Fertilizer Should Be Reasonably Priced
    Wu Erxiang
    After transplanting rice seedlings, just when the seedlings need topdressing, many agricultural production cooperative managers in Guangdong Province are crying out for fertilizer shortages. Why is there a fertilizer shortage? In addition to the fact that the supply of chemical fertilizers cannot keep up, another important reason is that these agricultural production cooperatives, in acquiring manure, excrement, ashes, and other farm fertilizers from their members, have violated the policy of mutual benefit, hurting the enthusiasm of the members to accumulate fertilizer. For example, the Nanshan Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Puning County stipulated that ten loads of urine and manure would only be compensated with 2 to 4 jiao, which is much lower than the local market price. Therefore, members are unwilling to sell urine and manure fertilizer to the cooperative, and the cooperative's acquisition of urine and manure only reached about half of the amount it should have acquired. Farmers in the Chaoshan area originally had the habit of accumulating human and animal excrement, sewage, green manure, etc., and applying them after composting; however, now many members are unwilling to compost fertilizer.
    Some agricultural production cooperatives also adopt inappropriate pricing methods for buying fertilizer from members. For example, the Du’bei Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingning County does not acquire manure based on the quantity and quality of each member's manure fertilizer, but rather prices it based on population. They give a fixed amount of money each month, so members are unwilling to accumulate more manure fertilizer. It is estimated that this township's manure fertilizer has decreased by at least one-third compared to previous years.
    Farm fertilizer is the main source of fertilizer needed for agricultural production for a considerable period. According to estimates by the agricultural departments, in Guangdong Province, if human and animal excrement alone can be well accumulated, it would be enough to fertilize one hundred million mu of farmland for the whole year. After agricultural cooperation, to accumulate large quantities of farm fertilizer, it is necessary for cooperatives to acquire fertilizer from members at reasonable prices in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit, encouraging members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer.

    收购社员的肥料应合理作价    
    吴尔祥
    在插秧以后，正当禾苗需要追肥的时候，广东省许多农业生产合作社的管理人员都在喊缺肥。为什么缺肥呢？除了因为化学肥料的供应赶不上外，还有一个重要原因，就是这些农业生产合作社在收购社员的人畜粪尿、草木灰等农家肥料方面，违反了互利政策，伤害了社员积肥的积极性。比如普宁县南山乡农业生产合作社，曾经规定尿粪每十担只给二角到四角的代价，比当地市价低得多。因此社员都不愿意把尿粪肥卖给合作社，合作社所收购到的尿粪只达到应收购量的一半左右。潮汕地区的农民本来都有把人畜粪尿、污水、绿肥等积存起来沤熟后再施用的习惯；但是，现在许多社员都不愿沤肥了。
    还有一些农业生产合作社在收买社员肥料中所采用的作价办法也不妥当。比如兴宁县笃陂乡农业生产合作社，不是按每户社员的粪肥数量、质量作价收购，而是按人口论价。每月固定给那么一点钱，因此社员不愿意多积粪肥。据估计，这个乡的粪肥至少比往年减少了三分之一。
    农家肥料在相当时期内是农业生产所需肥料的主要来源。据农业部门的估计，广东省单是人畜粪尿，如果能够很好积蓄，就足够一亿亩农田全年施肥的需要。在农业合作化以后，要大量积蓄农家肥料，就要靠合作社按照互利原则，用合理的价格收购社员的肥料，鼓励社员积肥的积极性。
