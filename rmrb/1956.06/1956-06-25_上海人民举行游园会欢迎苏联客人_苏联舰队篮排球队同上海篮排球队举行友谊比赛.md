Shanghai, June 24th (By our own correspondent) Today is the fifth day of the Soviet friendship visit fleet's arrival in Shanghai. The people of Shanghai held a grand garden party in the beautiful Fuxing Park, and spent Sunday morning happily with the Soviet guests.

　　Fuxing Park after the rain was particularly beautiful. Under the plane trees, beside the fountains, and on the green lawns, people were everywhere having fun with the guests. The band played "Carnival Music," and the Soviet guests were dancing social dances at the invitation of the girls. In another corner of the park, the Red Star Puppet Troupe was performing the puppet show "Mr. Dong Guo" and "Han Xin Pursued." Acrobatics, stunt cycling, and dragon dances also attracted many guests. The Shanghai Workers' Amateur Art Troupe's folk music orchestra, chorus, and dance team performed "Swan Lake," soprano solos, shepherd dances, and other programs for the guests. A game area was also set up in the park, with all kinds of games.

　　At the garden party, the hosts and guests chatted enthusiastically everywhere, exchanging gifts, photos, and contact addresses.

　　Today, some of the soldiers and civilians in Shanghai continued to visit the Soviet fleet. In the afternoon, 150 naval soldiers stationed in Shanghai attended a reception on a cruiser at the invitation of the Soviet friendship visit fleet.

　　Shanghai, June 24th (By our own correspondent) This afternoon, more than 3,000 spectators in Shanghai watched the friendly matches between the Soviet Navy Pacific Fleet basketball and volleyball teams and the Shanghai basketball and volleyball teams.

　　At two o'clock sharp, the volleyball match began. The Shanghai team first won the first game with a score of 15 to 9; in the second game, the Soviet team strengthened its attack and tied the game with a score of 16 to 14; in the third and fourth games, the Shanghai team adopted a spaced-out ladder and fast-break offense, winning two consecutive games with scores of 16 to 14 and 15 to 8. As a result, the Shanghai team won three to one.

　　In the basketball game, the Soviet team often used fast attacks and mid-range shooting tactics, and when defending, they used man-to-man zone defense. In the first half, the Shanghai team once led 34 to 17; in the second half, the Soviet team launched an offensive, winning by ten points with a score of 52 to 42; however, due to losing more points in the first half, they lost to the Shanghai team with a score of 69 to 76.

    本报上海24日电　今天是苏联友好访华舰到达上海的第五天，上海人民在美丽的复兴公园举行了一次盛大的游园会，同苏联客人们欢度了星期日的上午。
    雨后的复兴公园分外美丽，在梧桐树下，喷水池旁，绿草地上，人们到处都在和客人们联欢。乐队高奏着“狂欢舞曲”，苏联客人在姑娘们的邀请下在跳着交谊舞。在公园的另一角，红星木偶剧团在演出木偶戏“东郭先生”、“追韩信”。杂技、车技和龙舞的表演场地上，也吸引了许多客人。上海市工人业余艺术团民管乐队、合唱队和舞蹈队，为客人们演出了“天鹅舞”，女声独唱、牧人舞等节目。公园里还布置了一个游戏场，有各种各样的游戏。
    在游园会上，主人和客人们到处热情地交谈着，相互交换礼物、照片和通讯处。
    今天上海一部分军民继续参观苏联舰队。下午驻上海海军水兵一百五十人应苏联友好访华舰队的邀请，在巡洋舰上参加了招待会。
    本报上海24日电　今天下午上海三千多观众在上海市体育馆观看了苏联海军太平洋舰队篮排球队同上海市篮排球队白队的友谊比赛。
    两点整，排球比赛开始。上海队先以十五比九胜第一局；第二局苏联队加强了攻击，又以十六比十四扳回一局；第三、第四局上海队采用了拉开梯次和快板球的进攻方法，以十六比十四，十五比八连胜两局。结果三比一，上海队获胜。
    在篮球比赛中，苏联队常常用快速进攻和中距离投篮的战术，在防守的时候，应用人钉人联防的方法。上半场，上海队曾经以三十四比十七领先；下半场，苏联队发动了攻势，以五十二比四十二获胜十分；但是，由于上半场失分较多，结果以六十九比七十六输给上海队。
