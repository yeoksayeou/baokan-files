Impressions of a Visit to the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Northern Shaanxi
——Speech by Representative Chen Qiyuan

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state's final accounts, agree with Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and agree with Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives, and I request that the Congress approve and adopt them.

Now, please allow me to give the Congress a brief report on my impressions of the visit to the old revolutionary base area of Northern Shaanxi with Minister Xie Juezai.

Our main focus during the visit to Northern Shaanxi was Yan'an. Of the 12 counties in the Yan'an Special District, we visited Huangling, Fu County, Luochuan, and Ganquan. At the same time, we also learned about the situation in the Suide Special District from reports by responsible comrades in the Suide Special District.

Northern Shaanxi People Advance While Overcoming Difficulties

Northern Shaanxi is a basin-like plateau. Due to continuous erosion, it has a crisscrossing pattern of ravines. The rivers are shallow and narrow, with few tributaries. Most of the cultivated land is on high mountain ridges or on stony slopes. Rainfall is scarce (less than 400 mm per year) and mostly concentrated in one period, with significant annual variation. Farmers need rain when it doesn't rain, so grain yields are very low. In addition, the roads are rugged, transportation is inconvenient, and epidemics are prevalent. Living conditions were originally extremely difficult. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under wartime conditions and under blockade, led the people of Northern Shaanxi to create a world-shaking situation: for the first time in history, the people of this poor and backward area lived a life of plenty, and they also paid about 60 million catties of public grain every year to support the central government, cadres, and defense forces; this area was transformed into a revolutionary holy land for cultivating tens of thousands of cadres and nurturing the new China; this area became a beacon guiding the Chinese revolution to victory. This made us once again realize the invincible power of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the revolutionary struggle, and more deeply appreciate the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the greatness of the Chinese people's strength.

In March 1947, the Jiang-Hu army occupied Yan'an, causing serious damage to Northern Shaanxi, and the people of Northern Shaanxi suffered significant losses. According to statistics from the Yan'an Special District alone, the loss of grain and property (converted to refined grain) was more than 2.1 million shi, agricultural implements more than 310,000 pieces, livestock more than 60,000 heads, and the reduction in grain production due to wasteland and damaged crops was more than 2 million shi, leaving more than 400,000 people in a state of hunger. Since the liberation of Yan'an in April 1948, the central government has allocated hundreds of millions of yuan in grain and funds to help the people of Northern Shaanxi heal the wounds of war and carry out production and construction, and vitality has gradually recovered. However, due to three droughts and various natural disasters in the past seven or eight years, the smooth progress of recovery and production and construction has been seriously affected. Especially the severe drought of 1955 added many new difficulties to the people of Northern Shaanxi. Whether the current life of the people of Northern Shaanxi has returned to the kind of abundance that existed when the Party Central Committee was in Yan'an, responsible comrades and other cadres in Yan'an also expressed doubts about this. Compared with many new areas across the country, the lives of the people of Northern Shaanxi are still poorer. For example, the average yield per mu in the Yan'an Special District is only 92 catties, and even lower in Suide. Last year, due to the drought, it was only 27 catties per mu, and this year's plan is only 68 catties.

However, since liberation, the people of Northern Shaanxi have not bowed their heads to difficulties. Under the leadership and strong support of the Party and the government, they have gradually restored and developed production in the struggle against various natural disasters. The cultivated area has gradually expanded, and grain production has increased year by year. In 1955, the cultivated area in the Yan'an Special District increased by 7% compared with 1950, including a doubling of paddy fields and a doubling and a half of irrigated land. Grain production in 1954 increased by 30.9% compared with 1950 (reduced production due to disaster in 1955). In 1955, draught animals increased by 60% compared with 1950, and goats increased by 90%. The people's living standards have been greatly restored and improved compared with the early days of liberation, and cultural, educational, health, and transportation undertakings have also made great progress. After Chairman Mao made his report on agricultural cooperation last year, the peasants in Northern Shaanxi launched a high tide of cooperation. Now the number of agricultural cooperatives in the Yan'an Special District has reached 91.8% of households, and those participating in advanced cooperatives account for 90%. Last winter and this spring, a mass movement of accumulating manure and digging wells was launched in the high tide of production. The Yan'an Special District accumulated 300 to 400 million catties of manure, equivalent to the total amount of manure accumulated in the previous four years; and dug more than 2,000 wells, equivalent to more than six times the number of existing wells. They also plan to irrigate more than 600,000 mu of riverbank land within seven years by digging through-river wells along the river and installing waterwheels and pumps. They have planned a happy and beautiful future and are advancing on the road of socialism with full confidence, just like the people of the whole country.

Difficulties and Problems That Must Be Solved Quickly

However, in their progress, they still need more support, and there are still many difficulties and problems that must be solved quickly.

First, a common health care problem reflected by the masses in Northern Shaanxi is that the consultation fees and medicine costs of health institutions are too high, and they cannot afford to see a doctor. According to the charging standards stipulated by the Shaanxi Provincial Health Department, the consultation fee for county health centers is 5 jiao for each visit within 5 li, and it increases according to the distance for distances beyond 5 li, reaching 4 yuan for about 50 li. Surgery fees and injections range from 2 jiao to 2 yuan per time. Drug costs have also increased year by year. The masses reflect that the average profit margin of drug prices in various hospitals and clinics in Northern Shaanxi is currently more than 35%. People who live 10 li away from the hospital have to spend at least 2 to 3 yuan for a doctor's visit and medication, and if they come for a follow-up visit, they have to spend 5 to 6 yuan. The income from one mu of land in the barren mountainous areas of Northern Shaanxi is not enough to pay for a simple doctor's visit. The more remote the mountainous areas are from the county seat, the more diseases there are, the greater the difficulties, and the more serious the problem becomes. The people of Northern Shaanxi find it even more difficult to talk about being hospitalized for treatment. A secretary who accompanied us on the inspection in Northern Shaanxi spent more than 22 yuan for staying in the Yan'an People's Hospital for 3 days due to a cold and diarrhea. Due to the high cost of hospitalization, some patients bring their own grain and dried vegetables to cook in the hospital, and there are many "small stoves" at the entrance of the ward. Some cannot afford the hospitalization fees and have to sell their belongings or run around trying to obtain free medical care. The masses reflect that the reason why health institutions have to do this is due to the existence of "enterprise-oriented" and "unified charging standards" methods. They believe that the current living standards are still low. If health institutions do not adapt to local conditions and appropriately reduce various charging standards, it will inevitably lead to an increase in the mortality rate. The delivery fee in Yan'an is 3 yuan in the city and 1 yuan in the countryside, which the masses cannot afford. Most rely on themselves or old midwives for delivery, and the infant mortality rate has gradually increased again. The people of Northern Shaanxi hope that health institutions will pay close attention to the above issues and quickly reduce consultation fees, drug costs, surgery fees, hospitalization fees, and delivery fees.

Epidemics have occurred in the Northern Shaanxi region for many years, mainly measles, smallpox, dysentery, typhoid fever, and "yellow water vomiting" disease. In particular, measles occurs every year, and other diseases are caused by measles, resulting in serious morbidity and mortality. This year, more than 700 children in Yan'an suffered from measles, and more than 100 died. "Yellow water vomiting" disease is most prevalent in Huanglong County, with entire families of eight dying from it.

The situation of endemic diseases is also very serious. According to incomplete statistics, of the 630,000 people in the Yan'an Special District, more than 20,000 suffer from goiter and more than 14,000 suffer from "willow cripple" disease. In Fu County, 1,826 people suffer from "willow cripple" disease, accounting for 4% of the population. In a primary school in Huanglong County, more than one-third of the students are often unable to attend physical education classes due to this disease.

The masses in Northern Shaanxi request that an epidemic prevention station or team be established in each of Zhidan, Yan'an, and Luochuan, and an endemic disease prevention and treatment center be established in each of Huanglong, Yijun, and Ganquan. The masses believe that for areas like Northern Shaanxi, the most urgent task for health administrative departments should be: to carry out extensive and regular health education, pay attention to improving environmental sanitation, solve the inspection and disinfection of drinking water, organize and utilize the strength of traditional Chinese medicine, prevent the spread of epidemics, study the prevention and treatment methods of endemic diseases, and train and replenish health technical personnel, and appropriately set up medical stations in remote mountainous areas. For the time being, do not indiscriminately implement the "unified charging standards" method, and even more so, do not turn "enterprise-oriented" into "capitalist-oriented," which is something we should be wary of. The above are all problems that the people of Northern Shaanxi urgently need to solve, and we believe that it is necessary to consider them.

Second, the main threats to the lives of the people of Northern Shaanxi are drought and soil erosion. Water conservancy is undeveloped. People depend on the weather for their livelihood, and a slight drought will cause disaster, often resulting in crop failure. Soil erosion is serious, and it is difficult to retain fertile soil, making it difficult to increase grain yields. As a result of frequent disasters and soil erosion, some places do not grow even a blade of grass, and there is a severe shortage of grass and feed for livestock, resulting in a high mortality rate of draught animals. There is insufficient pasture in Northern Shaanxi. It is said that the current forage production can only feed 700,000 to 800,000 sheep, and the sheep-raising industry is not easy to develop (in Wuqi County, one catty of grass is as expensive as 1 jiao, while one catty of millet is only 7 to 8 fen; the masses say that livestock feed is a small-stove standard). Feed is too expensive, and farmers cannot afford to raise cattle, so they have no choice but to sell their hides and meat after they die, which is more expensive than selling them alive (a live cow is only worth 7 to 8 yuan). It is said that the responsible comrades of Shaanxi Province have consulted with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to "transfer livestock to grass" to solve this problem of grass shortage. Under the above conditions, it is difficult to improve people's lives. It is estimated that poor households with difficult lives in Northern Shaanxi account for at least 15% of the total number of households, and in some of the poorest areas, it reaches 30%. Social relief in peacetime and emergency relief in times of disaster are certainly very necessary, but they are not a fundamental solution. After agricultural cooperation, we should help the people of Northern Shaanxi get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity more quickly from the two aspects of water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation. The leading comrades of the province, special district, and county have all paid attention to this, and last winter and this spring, they have mobilized the masses to dig wells and carry out soil and water conservation work, and have achieved initial results. However, the difficult problem of the need for massive investment has not been resolved. Larger projects cannot be done without state investment, but local water conservancy departments often believe that water conservancy construction in Northern Shaanxi is not cost-effective because the mountains are high, the wells are deep, there are many stones and few forests, the cost of water conservancy construction is high, the investment is large, and the benefits are small. High cost and large investment are facts. In other areas, every 100 yuan of water conservancy investment can irrigate three to four mu of land, while in Northern Shaanxi, it can only irrigate half a mu. In Lijiaqu Township, Yan'an, it costs 1,500 yuan to dig a well, which is enough to dig five wells in Guanzhong. Even so, the investment in water conservancy construction in Northern Shaanxi still has great benefits: First, it reduces the risk of drought and prevents disasters from occurring with the slightest drought. Second, it turns dry land into paddy fields, and the yield per mu can be increased by two to four or five times. Third, with more paddy fields, it is possible to convert some of the steeper mountain areas into pastureland, plant forage grass, breed cattle and sheep, and develop animal husbandry; it is also possible to build orchards in mountainous areas with suitable conditions, planting apples, dates, mulberries, pears, persimmons, etc., and greatly increase people's income from the development of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries. Fourth, with reduced disasters, increased income, and guaranteed people's lives, the ability to resist disasters is enhanced, and the government can reduce a large amount of relief and disaster relief expenses for Northern Shaanxi every year. The investment in water conservancy construction in Northern Shaanxi is indeed quite large, but the state's expenditure on relief and disaster relief in Northern Shaanxi over the years is not small. In the drought of 1955, the government transported 175 million catties of grain, and also spent approximately double the amount of transportation costs (more than 20 million yuan) to mobilize truck teams from Chengdu, Xi'an, and Zhengzhou to rush to transport grain to supply the disaster areas. If the disaster relief grain transportation costs of 1955 were used for water conservancy construction, it would indeed be almost enough to build and develop the water conservancy of the three rivers in Northern Shaanxi (Wuding River, Yan River, Luo River). Moreover, this water conservancy investment can be spent in two or three years. Therefore, state investment in water conservancy construction in Northern Shaanxi is, in the long run, something that not only saves the state's relief and disaster relief expenses but also greatly benefits the people of Northern Shaanxi.

Third, inconvenient transportation is also an important problem that needs to be solved urgently in Northern Shaanxi. The existing Xian-Song Highway has been well-repaired, and it has played a significant role in improving the lives of the people of Northern Shaanxi and carrying out production and construction. Relying on it, it was possible to transport a large amount of grain in a timely manner last year to supply the disaster areas. However, it is not enough for Northern Shaanxi to have this highway, and it is also necessary to vigorously develop transportation. The investment may also be larger, because there are many stone roads, many bridges, and many culverts, and the project is relatively arduous. It can be invested step by step, giving priority to the most urgent. For example, the Yan-Yi Road (Yan'an to Yichuan) and Yan-Wu Road (Yan'an to Wuqi) currently being repaired in the Yan'an Special District still need help due to insufficient investment, so that they can be completed as soon as possible. After the Yan-Wu Road is opened, the Wu-Ding Road (Wuqi to Dingbian) should be opened next, so that the salt and fur and other local products from the Dingbian area can be transported out, and even if that area suffers a disaster, it will be easy to provide support. In addition, in terms of developing railway transportation, the people of Northern Shaanxi hope that the planned railways from Taiyuan to Yinchuan (connecting to the Lan-Bao Road) and from Baotou to Xi'an can be completed earlier. These two railways both run through the Northern Shaanxi area, and completing them earlier is of great significance for accelerating the improvement of the lives of the people of Northern Shaanxi and the smooth progress of construction work. This is a major event that the people of Northern Shaanxi are looking forward to from the government day and night.

Some Opinions

Based on the situation of the inspection, please allow me to offer the following opinions:

First, I agree with Minister Xie's suggestion to allow the people of Northern Shaanxi to recuperate for a period of time. Reduce the burden or do not increase the burden within several years. At the same time, vigorously help them to quickly increase grain production and develop sideline industries such as forestry and animal husbandry. Provide more support and assistance in cultural, educational, health, and water conservancy, transportation and other construction aspects.

Second, vigorously strengthening and improving leadership is the fundamental problem in the current work of Northern Shaanxi. I fully agree with Minister Xie Juezai's suggestion to the Shaanxi Provincial Authorities: It is necessary to have a provincial party secretary or deputy governor stationed in Northern Shaanxi, to guide on a tour, and to specifically help the cadres of Northern Shaanxi improve their ideological level, improve their work style and work methods, overcome the complacency and conservative thinking of a few cadres, and cultivate new forces.

Third, Northern Shaanxi and all the old revolutionary base areas have made extremely glorious and great contributions to the victory of our country's revolution, have suffered serious damage from the revolutionary enemy, and have undergone significant sacrifices and losses. Moreover, all the old revolutionary base areas are mountainous areas with poor economic conditions and difficult recovery. Although the government has provided great support and assistance in terms of manpower and material resources since liberation, and the people of the old areas have continued to carry forward the glorious traditions of the revolution, actively overcome difficulties, and production and life have been restored and improved, the difficulties still exist, and the difficulties in Northern Shaanxi may also exist in other revolutionary base areas to varying degrees. Therefore, it is specially recommended that the people's committees of each province send senior responsible cadres to conduct an in-depth inspection of the work and people's lives in the old base areas within a short period of time, and effectively solve various special difficulties, or request the central government to help solve them, and at the same time, make a comprehensive plan for the development and construction of the old base areas.

The Issue of Ordinary Cadres in Northern Shaanxi

In addition, I would also like to talk about the issue of ordinary cadres in the Northern Shaanxi region. Most of them are honest, diligent, simple, and loyal servants of the people, but during this inspection, it was also found that a small number of state organ cadres are indifferent to or insufficiently concerned about the sufferings of the people's lives. As mentioned above, the fact that health institutions charge excessive fees is a clear example. The most prominent example is the incident in which the staff of the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Organs established a labor reform farm in Huangling County and forcibly relocated farmers. In early April of this year, Yuan Zhenmin, a cadre of the Provincial Public Security Department, arrived in Huangling County with an ordinary letter of introduction from the General Office of the Provincial Government, claiming an urgent task of opening a labor reform farm, and demanded that the county magistrate relocate 133 households of farmers in one township within 17 days (from April 3 to April 20), and allow the labor reform farm to use nearly 400 people's houses and thousands of mu of land that were about to be sown. The county magistrate did not dare to "reject" the arrogance of the cadre sent by the superior, and did not submit this major issue related to the lives of nearly 400 people to the County People's Committee and the County People's Congress for discussion. He called the special commissioner for instructions but received no reply (at that time, the responsible comrades of the Yan'an Special Commissioner's Office were all participating in the Party Congress and were very busy), nor did he reflect the matter to the province. He actually implemented this wrong plan of forced relocation, causing 133 households of farmers to be displaced in all directions, creating difficulties in their lives. When we passed by, some people had not even been properly resettled. These people, as the saying goes: "Sitting at home, disaster comes from the sky." This is the most typical example of not caring about the sufferings of the people's lives. When we reported this incident to the province, the provincial government had already paid attention to the matter and was being investigated and dealt with by the Provincial Supervision Department.

In his speech, Vice Premier Deng Zihui pointed out that the ideal of "making the old have a place to end their lives, the strong have a place to use their talents, the young have a place to grow up, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled are all cared for" should be gradually realized, and I fully support it. Article 53 of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Cooperatives, regarding the objects to be taken care of and arranged for in life and production, and Article 7, regarding the objects to be absorbed into the cooperative, are all objects served by the civil affairs departments. They are those members of the community and martyrs' families, military families, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, disaster victims, poor people, and immigrants who lack labor or have completely lost their ability to labor and have no means of support. As a servant of the people, a civil affairs cadre must constantly think about what they can do and what they need. Some of them have contributed to the country or are contributing, which is to contribute to everyone, and they should be treated preferentially by the state and the people. We must also think about those who do not have or lack the ability to labor. They are not unwilling to labor, but unable to labor, and they should be rescued and helped by the state and the people. Only by constantly thinking like this can we serve the people wholeheartedly. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the side with a higher percentage of the pre-distribution plan of agricultural production cooperatives, but must always pay attention to the side with a lower percentage. Because the side with a lower percentage is precisely the object of service of the civil affairs department. If the civil affairs workers do not pay attention, their interests will often be ignored, because they are a minority. To give an example, for example, the Dongfanghong Cooperative in Liulin Township, Yan'an County, has a total of 199 farm households. In this year's pre-distribution, the maximum increase in income among the 152 general members was 38.8 yuan, and the minimum was 6.88 yuan; but among the 47 martyrs' families, military families, and widowed, orphaned, and lonely people, the maximum increase in income for 40 households was only 8.88 yuan, and the minimum was only 6.98 yuan, while 7 households had a decrease in income, with a maximum decrease of 22.5 yuan. In this way, the superiority of socialism does not seem to apply to them. Therefore, the civil affairs department should study the reasons for the decrease in income of these few people, and must not let the lives of these few people be difficult, let alone turn a blind eye to their living difficulties. In the past, civil affairs workers, including myself, have not done enough in terms of relief and welfare work related to the realization of this ideal, and have made many mistakes of bureaucracy and conservatism. In the future, we should better implement Chairman Mao's instructions to "care about the lives of the masses and pay attention to working methods." We must not only care about the lives of the majority, but also care about the lives of the minority; not only pay attention to collective interests, but also take care of individual interests; to achieve "each gets what he deserves"; not only overcome the ideological and work style of conservatism, but also constantly pay attention to preventing the tendency of blind advance; not only make comprehensive plans, but also strengthen leadership and conduct in-depth inspections. Only in this way can we do a good job, and I believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, it will inevitably be done well.

Please correct me if the above immature opinions are inappropriate.

    陕北老区视察观感
    ——陈其瑗代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于国家预决算的报告，同意彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，同意廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明，并请大会予以批准通过。
    现在请允许我把这次和谢觉哉部长到陕北老区视察的观感，向大会作简单的汇报。
    我们到陕北主要视察重点是延安。在延安专区12个县当中，我们并到过黄陵、鄜县、洛川、甘泉4个县。同时，还从绥德专区负责同志的会报中，了解了一些绥德专区的情况。
    陕北人民在克服困难中前进
    陕北是一个盆地状的高原，因受连续不断的剥蚀作用，造成纵横交错的沟谷；河道浅窄，支流不多；耕地多在高耸的山峁高原上或在多石的斜坡上；雨量稀少
  （全年在400公厘以下），而且大部集中在一个时期降落，逐年变率很大，农民需要雨的时候又不雨，因此粮食产量很低；加上道路崎岖，交通不便；疫病流行；生活条件原来是异常艰苦的。可是，在抗日战争时期，党中央和毛主席在战争的条件下，在被封锁的情况下，却领导陕北人民在这里创造了惊天动地的局面：使这个贫困落后地区的人民在历史上第一次过着丰衣足食的生活，还要每年缴纳6，000万斤左右的公粮，供养中央机关、干部和保卫军队；使这个地区变成了培育成千成万干部和孕育新中国的革命圣地；使这个地区变成了一座指引中国革命走向胜利的灯塔。使我们又一次体会到马克斯列宁主义和毛泽东著作在革命斗争中的不可战胜的力量，更深刻体会到中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导和中国人民力量的伟大。
    1947年3月蒋胡军侵占延安，给陕北带来了严重的破坏，陕北人民遭受了重大的损失。仅延安专区的统计，损失了粮食财物（折细粮）210余万石，农具31万余件，牲畜6万多头，荒芜田地或毁坏青苗减产200余万石，40余万人陷于饥饿状态。1948年4月延安光复以后到现在，中央拨出了数以亿计的粮款，帮助陕北人民医治战争创伤进行生产建设，元气逐渐恢复。但因七、八年来先后发生了三次旱灾和各种自然灾害，严重地影响了恢复工作和生产建设工作的顺利进行。尤其是1955年的大旱灾，给陕北人民增加了不少新的困难。陕北人民目前的生活，是否恢复到党中央在延安时那种丰衣足食的景况。延安负责同志和其他干部同志对这点也表示怀疑。和全国许多新区相比，陕北人民的生活仍然是差些。比如延安专区平均每亩产量只92斤，绥德还更低些；去年因旱灾每亩只27斤，今年计划也只68斤。
    但是，解放以来，陕北人民并没有向困难低头。他们在党和政府的领导和大力支援下，在和各种自然灾害作斗争当中，逐步恢复发展了生产。耕地面积逐渐扩大，粮食产量逐年提高。延安专区耕地1955年比1950年增加了7％，其中水田增加了一倍，水浇地增加了一倍半。粮食产量1954年比1950年增加了30.9％（1955年因灾减产）。耕畜1955年较1950年增加了60％，山羊增加了90％。人民生活较之解放初期有了很大的恢复和改善，文教卫生交通事业也有了很大的发展。去年毛主席作了关于农业合作化的报告以后，陕北农民掀起了合作化高潮，现在延安专区农业社的户数已达91.8％，参加高级社的占90％。去冬今春，在生产高潮中展开了群众性的积肥打井运动。延安专区积肥3亿至4亿斤，等于以往4年积肥的总和；打井2，000多口，等于原有井数的6倍多，他们还计划在7年以内，用沿河打透河井，安水车、抽水机等办法，把60余万亩川地灌为水田。他们规划了幸福美丽的生活远景，和全国人民一样满怀信心地在社会主义的道路上前进着。
  必须迅速解决的困难和问题
    可是，他们在前进当中，还须要更多的支援，还有不少的困难和问题必须迅速加以解决。
    一、陕北群众最普遍反映的一个卫生保健问题就是卫生机关出诊费和药费收费太高，看不起病。按陕西省卫生厅规定的收费标准，县卫生院出诊费5里以内每次收5角，5里以外按距离增收，至50里左右收4元。手术费注射一次从2角起多至2元。药费也逐年增高，群众反映目前陕北各卫生院、所的药价，平均利润在35％以上。住在离卫生院10里路的人，请医生看病服药一次，起码就要花2至3元，如果再来一次复诊就要花到5元至6元，陕
  北贫瘠山区的农民一亩产量的收入还不够
  看一次普通的病。离县城越远的山沟地区，疾病较多，困难越大，问题就更严重。陕北农民谈起有病住院治疗更不容易。这次同我们到陕北视察的一位秘书同志因感冒和拉肚子住延安人民医院3天，即花了22元多。由于医院住院费高，有的病人自带粮食干菜在医院自己做饭吃，病房门口就有不少“小灶”。有的交不起住院费，只好变卖物件或到处奔走设法请求免费医疗。群众反映卫生机关要这样做的原因是由于有“企业化”，“收费标准统一”的办法存在，他们认为目前生活水平还低，如果卫生机关不因地制宜，对各种收费标准予以适当的减轻，势必造成死亡率的增加。延安接生费是城内3元农村1元，群众负担不起，多靠自己或旧产婆接生，婴儿出生死亡率又逐渐增加了。陕北人民希望卫生机关切实重视以上这些问题，迅速减低出诊费、药费、手术费、住院费和接生费。
      陕北地区历年疫病流行，主要的是麻疹、天花、痢疾、伤寒、吐黄水等病。特别是麻疹每年流行，由麻疹又引起其他疾病，造成严重的发病率和死亡率。今年延安患麻疹的儿童700多名，死亡的100多名。吐黄水病黄龙县最流行，有全家八口因此死光的。
      地方病的情况也很严重。延安专区人
  口63万人，据不完全统计，患甲状腺肿大者2万余人，患柳拐子病的14，000余人。鄜县柳拐子病患者1，826人，占人口4％。黄龙县的一间小学有三分之一以上学生因患此病经常不能上体育课。
    陕北群众要求在志丹、延安、洛川各设一个防疫站或防疫队，在黄龙、宜君、甘泉各设一地方病防治所。群众认为像陕北这样的地区，卫生行政部门当务之急应当是：广泛地经常地进行卫生宣传工作，注意改善环境卫生，解决吃水的检查消毒，组织发挥中医力量，防止疫病的流行，研究地方病的防治方法，培养补充卫生技术人员，在偏僻山区酌设医疗站等等。暂时还不要毫无区别地厉行“收费标准统一”的办法，更不可把“企业化”变成“资本主义化”，这是值得我们警惕的。以上都是陕北人民迫切需要解决的问题，我们认为有考虑的必要。
    二、对陕北人民生活主要的威胁是旱灾和水土流失。水利不兴。靠天吃饭，稍旱就成灾，往往颗粒无收。水土流失严重，田肥难以贮留，粮食产量不易提高。经常遭灾和水土流失的结果，有些地方寸草不长，牲口草料饲料很缺乏，耕畜死亡率高。陕北牧草不足，现在饲草产量据说只能养活七、八十万只羊，饲羊业也不容易发展
  （吴旗县一斤草贵到一角多，一斤小米才七、八分，群众说牲口草料是小灶标准）。饲料太贵，农民养不起牛，只好任其死去之后出卖皮肉，比出卖活的价钱高（一头活牛只值七、八元）。听说陕西省负责同志曾与内蒙古自治区协商“移畜就草”来解决这种草荒问题。在上述的条件下，人民生活是难于提高的。估计陕北生活困难的贫困户至少占总户数15％以上，有些最贫瘠地方达30％。平时的社会救济和灾荒时的紧急救济当然是很必要的，但不是根本办法。在农业合作化以后，应当从兴修水利和水土保持两方面去帮助陕北人民更迅速脱离贫困走向富裕。省、专、县的领导同志对这点都已重视，去冬今春已经发动群众打井和搞水土保持工作，取得了初步成绩。但需要大量的投资的困难问题未得解决。稍大的工程非国家投资不可，而地方水利部门往往因为陕北山大井深，石多林少，水利建设造价高、投资大、效益小，认为化不来。造价高投资大这是事实。在其他地区每百元水利投资，能浇三、四亩地，而在陕北则只能浇半亩地。在延安李家渠乡打一井要1，500元，在关中足够打五口井。虽然如此，投资兴修陕北水利，效益还是很大的：第一，减少旱患，不致稍旱就成灾。第二，变旱地为水地，亩产量可以提高一倍至四、五倍。第三，水地多了，就可以把一部分坡度较大的山地转变为牧地，栽种饲草，繁殖牛羊，发展畜牧业；还可以在有条件的山地营造果木林，种植苹果、枣、桑、梨、柿等，从林牧副业的发展上可以大大增加人民收入。第四，灾害减少，收入增加，人民生活有了保障，抗灾能力增强，每年就可以减少政府对陕北很大一笔救济费救灾费的开支。陕北的水利建设投资固然相当大，可是历年国家对陕北救济费救灾费的开支数字并不小。1955年旱灾，政府运去的粮食17，500万斤，还花了大约双倍的运输费（2，000多万元）从成都、西安、郑州调集汽车队赶运粮食供应灾区。如果把1955年救灾运粮费用于水利建设，的确差不多可以兴修、发展陕北三条河流（无定河、延河、洛河）的水利。而且这种水利投资还可以分两三个年期支出。所以国家投资陕北水利建设，从长远看，是一件既节省国家救济救灾费的开支又对陕北人民有莫大利益的事情。
    三、交通不便，也是陕北急待解决的重要问题。现有的咸宋公路整修得很好，它对陕北人民生活的提高和生产建设的进行起了很大的作用。依靠了它，去年才有可能调运大批粮食及时供应灾区。但是陕北有了这条公路还是不够，还须大力发展交通。投资可能也要大些，因为石路多，桥梁多，涵洞多，工程比较艰巨。可以分先后缓急，逐步投资逐步发展。例如延安专区正在整修的延宜路（延安到宜川）和延吴路（延安到吴旗），因为投资不足，还须给予帮助，使其早日完成。修通延吴路后，接着应修通吴定路（吴旗到定边），使定边一带的盐和皮毛等土产能运出来，即使那一带遭了灾也容易支援。此外，在发展铁路交通方面，陕北人民希望把在计划中的由太原到银川（接兰包路）和由包头到西安的铁路，能够提早修通。这两条铁路都贯穿陕北地区，提早修通对于加速陕北人民生活的提高和建设工作的顺利进行，有极重大的意义。这是陕北人民朝夕期望于政府的一件大事。
        几点意见
    根据视察的情况，请允许我提出下列几点意见：
    一、我同意谢部长的建议，要让陕北人民休养生息一个时期。在若干年内减轻负担或不增加负担。同时大力帮助他们迅速提高粮食产量和发展林牧等副业。在文教卫生方面，在水利、交通等建设方面给予更多的支援和帮助。
    二、大力加强和改善领导，是当前陕北工作上的根本问题。我完全同意谢觉哉部长向陕西省当局的建议：需要有一位省委书记或副省长常驻陕北，巡回指导，具体帮助陕北干部提高思想水平，改善工作作风和工作方法，克服少数干部自满情绪和保守思想，培养新生力量。
    三、陕北和全国各革命老根据地对我国革命的胜利都作过极其光荣伟大的贡献，都曾遭受过革命敌人严重的破坏，经受过重大的牺牲损失。而且各革命老根据地又都是山区，经济条件较差，恢复不易。虽然解放以来，政府曾在人力物力上给予很大的支援帮助，老区人民也继续发挥了革命的光荣传统，积极克服困难，生产生活得到了恢复和改善。但是根据此次到陕北视察的情况看，困难仍然是存在的，陕北的困难可能在其他革命老根据地也不同程度地存在着。因此，特建议各省人民委员会能在短期内派出高级负责干部，对老根据地的工作和人民生活作一次深入检查，切实解决各种特殊困难，或提请中央帮助解决，同时作出老根据地发展建设的全面规划。
    陕北地方一般干部问题
    此外，我还想谈谈陕北地区一般干部问题，他们绝大部分都是老实勤恳、朴素、忠诚的人民勤务员，但在此次视察当中，还发现少数国家机关干部对人民生活疾苦漠不关心或关心不够。如上面谈过的卫生机关收费过高的事实就是一个明显的例子。最突出的还是陕西省公安机关工作人员在黄陵县建立劳改农场，强迫迁移农民的事件。今年4月初，省公安厅的干部袁振民拿着一封省府办公厅的普通介绍信到黄陵县借口开办劳改农场的紧急任务，要求县长在17天内（由4月3日至4月20日）迁走一个乡的133户农民，把将近400人的房屋，成千亩的正要下种的土地都让给劳改农场使用。县长对于那位上级派来干部的气焰，不敢“顶”回去，又没有将这个关系近400人生活的重大问题提交县人民委员会和县人民代表大会讨论，电话请示专署未获答复（当时延安专署负责同志都参加党代表大会，非常忙碌）也没有向省反映，竟执行了这个错误的强迫迁移的计划，致使133户农民流离迁徙各方，造成生活困难，在我们经过时候还有一部分人连住所都未予安置好。这些老百姓，正如俗语说：“闭门家里坐，祸从天上来”。这是不关心人民生活疾苦的最典型的例子。这个事件在我们向省反映的时候省府已经注意此事，正由省监察厅调查处理中。
    邓子恢副总理在发言中指出要“使老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”的理想逐步变成现实，我是完全拥护的。高级农业合作社示范章程（草案）五十三条在生活上、生产上所要照顾安排的对象，和第七条所要吸收入社的对象，都是民政部门服务的对象。他们就是那些缺乏劳力或者完全丧失劳力，生活无依靠的老弱孤寡残疾的社员和烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人、灾民、贫民及外来移民等。作为一个人民的勤务员的民政干部，要时时刻刻想想他们能做什么，需要什么。他们有些为国家出过力或正在出力，即是为大家出力，应该受到国家和人民的优待。还要想想那些没有或缺乏劳动力的人，他们不是不愿意劳动，而是不能劳动，应该受到国家和人民的救济与帮助。只有经常这样想想，才算是全心全意为人民服务。因此，我们对于农业生产合作社的预分方案，不能只满足于百分比数字多的一边的人，而且要经常注意百分比数字少的一边的人。因为百分比数字少的一边的人，正是民政部门的服务对象，民政工作者不留心注意，他们的利益往往就会被人忽略了，因为他们是少数。举一个例来说，譬如延安县柳林乡东方红合作社，共有199农户。本年预分，在152户一般社员中收入增加最多的是38.8元，最少的6.88元；但是在47户烈属、军属、鳏寡孤独中有40户收入增加最多的才有8.88元，最少的只有6.98元，减少收入的有7户，最多减到22.5元。这样说起来，社会主义优越性，对于他们似乎是没有份的。因此，民政部门就要研究这百分之几的人们减少收入的原因，而不能让这少数人的生活过不去，更不应对他们的生活困难熟视无睹。过去民政工作者连我自己在内对于实现这理想有关的救济福利工作方面，检查起来还是做得很不够的，而且犯了不少官僚主义和保守思想的错误。我们今后应该更好地执行毛主席“关心群众生活、注意工作方法”的指示。我们不仅要关心大多数人的生活，还须关心少数人的生活；不仅注意集体利益，还须照顾个人利益；要做到“各得其所”；不仅要克服保守主义的思想作风，还须经常注意防止盲目冒进的倾向；不仅要全面规划，还须加强领导深入检查。只有这样才能把工作搞得好，我相信在党中央毛主席和国务院领导之下也必然会搞得好的。
    以上不成熟的意见，是否妥当，请予指正。
