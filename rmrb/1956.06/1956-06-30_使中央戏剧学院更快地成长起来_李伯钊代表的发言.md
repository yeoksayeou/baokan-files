    As an art educator, please allow me to briefly report on the situation of my workplace and my personal feelings to everyone.
    Since its reorganization in 1953, the Central Academy of Drama has become a higher education institution specializing in training talent for drama art, cultivating drama talent for the country with a Marxist-Leninist theoretical foundation, considerable literary and artistic cultivation, and the ability to master proficient professional skills. Under the active leadership and assistance of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Higher Education, the academy carried out its establishment and began teaching according to professional plans. Currently, it has majors in directing, performance, stage art, and dramatic literature (last year's art education conference decided to change the dramatic literature major to drama studies). With the direct teaching and assistance of Soviet experts, director and performance cadre training classes were opened to train directors and actors from theaters in various provinces and cities. The first phase of cadre training classes has graduated in the spring and summer of this year. Undergraduate students will also begin to graduate successively next year. Although the academy's work has achieved initial results, it lags far behind the needs of objective reality due to our insufficient efforts. Currently, we have several urgent problems that need to be resolved:
    First, regarding the resolution of the shortage of teachers. I agree with Minister Yang Xiufeng's speech, in which he talked about the issue of a lack of teachers. The Central Academy of Drama is a young higher education institution with a weak foundation, and the lack of teachers is even more serious. Generally, teachers are studying and teaching under the guidance of Soviet experts, so the quality is uneven and the quantity is also insufficient. According to the academy's preliminary twelve-year plan, in order to meet the needs of the development of the national drama cause, starting in 1958, we will successively run dual-track systems and add new majors, and are preparing to build an experimental theater to actively expand the number of cadres trained while ensuring a certain quality, striving to have more qualified graduates during the second five-year plan. However, if the quality of teachers is not improved and the source of teachers is not resolved, even the best plans will become empty talk. Therefore, I very much agree with Minister Yang Xiufeng's correct, effective, and practical proposition that higher education institutions must retain some outstanding graduates as working "mother machines." We have also put forward this opinion in the past, but it has always been impossible to implement. First, we dare not retain them, because if we do, various places will no longer send students with a good foundation to study. Second, even if we want to retain them, we cannot. There are many obstacles and reasons from all sides. We earnestly hope that comrades from all relevant parties can understand the difficulties of the lack of teachers in higher education institutions and agree to retain some outstanding graduates to work in the academy as teaching staff, as working "mother machines." On the other hand, it is of course necessary to ensure that a certain number of graduates are sent to various provinces and cities to strengthen the development of the drama cause. In this way, more professional cadres can be trained from higher education institutions to strengthen the professional drama theaters and troupes in various provinces and cities, and necessary teachers can be prepared for the drama academies that will be established in various provinces and cities.
    Second, the scientific research work of our academy in the past two or three years has mainly focused on compiling teaching syllabuses, textbooks, and selecting and compiling teaching repertoires, because our professional courses are generally newly opened courses, which is the first problem that teaching requires us to solve. However, our scientific research work has been carried out very poorly and very late. The Academic Research Committee was only established in 1954, and it launched criticism and struggles against idealist ideas and Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary theory. Regarding how scientific research work should be carried out in higher education institutions, we lack experience in this area, and we always feel that the issue of leadership relations has not been effectively supported and reasonably resolved. Minister Yang Xiufeng's opinion in his speech on the issue of higher education institutions cooperating with the Academy of Sciences and various business departments to carry out scientific research work is very good. For example, the "History of Chinese Opera" teaching and research group and the "History of Chinese Drama Movement" teaching and research group of the Central Academy of Drama hope that the Chinese Academy of Sciences can lead and cooperate with them, which can not only meet the needs of the Academy of Sciences for scientific research work in this area, but also improve the level of scientific research in the academy and adapt to the needs of the academy's teaching.
    The task of training graduate students and doctoral students is extremely arduous, and for the young Academy of Drama, it also lacks experience. If we follow the opinion put forward by Minister Yang Xiufeng: "The task of training graduate students and doctoral students should be uniformly arranged by the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education under the guidance of the national unified plan, and a training plan should be jointly formulated; in the recruitment and training work, we must also cooperate with each other in order to rationally use the strength of the mentors." Such a practice is feasible and achievable, and I agree with this method.
    While carrying out scientific research work, we must improve the working and living conditions of teachers. The problem of housing shortage in the academy is also very serious. There are more than one or two teaching staff members who cannot get married or postpone their marriage because they have no housing, and it is not uncommon for three generations to live in the same room. It is even more common for adults, children, eating, sleeping, studying, and preparing lessons to be squeezed into one room. We have a cadre dormitory, which is the best dormitory in our academy. It was originally purchased from civilian housing, all in the form of courtyards. Calculated by natural rooms, including toilets and kitchens, there are 110 rooms in total, each with only 10 square meters, housing 55 families with about 200 people, including 89 children. The courtyard is small, the population is large, and there are many children. The entire dormitory is like a children's activity field. Teachers cannot sleep and rest quietly, and they also lack a quiet place to prepare lessons. Even if there is time for scientific research, there is a lack of an environment for scientific research. This problem has been repeatedly reported to the leadership, but it has not been resolved until now. The comrades in charge of finance always say that there is no money and the housing problem cannot be solved. As the saying goes: "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." I hope that the leaders of the Ministry of Culture will send people to the academy to see the housing situation of the teachers, and they will know the seriousness of the housing shortage problem. There was a surplus in the cultural expenditure in 1955. Is it really that there is no money, or is it that the work is affected by having money but not using it? I hope that the relevant units will check and actively care about the improvement of teachers' working conditions and living conditions to facilitate the development of teaching and scientific research work.
    In addition, the theater problem is as important to our academy as a laboratory is to an engineering university or an affiliated hospital is to a medical school. However, an experimental theater that our academy originally planned to build has been allocated to other units.
    Third, although the academy has made some achievements under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Higher Education, we are not satisfied with the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education. Higher art schools do have their particularities, but they have many things in common with general higher education institutions. How to apply the experience of scientific research and departmental teaching and research leadership of ordinary higher education institutions to newly established art schools, in addition to relying on our own efforts to explore and create experience, it is more urgently needed that the Ministry of Higher Education vigorously strengthen leadership, so that we can get rid of the bureaucratic style more quickly and embark on the track of regularized higher education institutions as soon as possible.
    The Central Academy of Drama is still a young higher education institution, and we hope that all higher education institutions will give us strong support and supervision, so that the young younger brother can grow up faster.

### 使中央戏剧学院更快地成长起来——李伯钊代表的发言

专栏：

    使中央戏剧学院更快地成长起来
    ——李伯钊代表的发言
    我是一个艺术教育工作者，请允许我把我工作单位的情形及我个人的感受简单的向大家汇报一下。
    中央戏剧学院从1953年改组以来，成为专门培养话剧艺术人材的高等学校，为国家培养具有马列主义理论基础知识，有相当文学艺术修养，能掌握熟练专业技巧的话剧人材。学院在文化部和高等教育部的积极领导和帮助下，进行了建院，开始按专业计划进行教学，现设有导演、表演、舞台美术、戏剧文学等专业（去年艺术教育会议决定将戏剧文学专业改为戏剧学专业）。在苏联专家直接教学和帮助下，开设了导演、表演两个干部训练班，训练各省市剧院的导演和演员。第一期的干部训练班已于本年春季和暑期先后毕业。本科学生明年也将开始陆续有毕业生。虽然学院的工作是获得了初步的成绩，但是由于我们努力不够，远远落后于客观实际的需要。目前，我们有几个迫切需要解决的问题：
    第一，关于解决师资缺乏的问题。我同意杨秀峰部长的发言，在他的发言中谈到缺乏师资的问题。中央戏剧学院是一个年轻的高等学校，基础薄弱，师资缺乏更为严重，一般教师都是在苏联专家指导下进修，边学边教，因而质量不高不齐，数量也很不够。按照学院十二年初步规划，为了适应国家戏剧事业发展的需要，1958年起，我们要陆续办双轨制和增设新的专业，并正在筹建实验话剧院，以积极扩大培养干部的数量同时保证一定质量，争取在第二个五年计划期间多有一些合乎规格的毕业生。可是如果师资的质量不提高，师资的来源不解决，再好的规划都会变成空谈。所以我非常同意杨秀峰部长关于高等学校必须留一部分优秀毕业生作工作母机的正确有效并且实际的主张。这个意见过去我们也提出来过，但是总是行不通。第一是不敢留。因为留了以后，各地就再不送基础好的学生来学习了。第二是要留也留不住。障碍重重，各方面理由都很多。殷切希望有关各方面的同志们能够体谅高等学校师资缺乏的苦衷，同意保留一部分优秀毕业生在学院担任教学工作，作工作母机。另方面当然也必须保证一定数量的毕业生派到各省市加强戏剧事业的发展。这样，既能从高等学校中培养出更多的专业干部来加强各省市的专业话剧院、团的业务，又能为各省市即将创办的话剧学院准备必要的师资。
    第二，我院的科学研究工作，近两三年来主要是放在编写教学大纲、教材和选编教学剧目上，因为我院专业课程一般说都是新开课程，这是教学上首先要求我们必须解决的问题。但是我们的科学研究工作开展得很差也很迟。1954年才成立学术研究委员会，展开过对唯心主义思想、胡风反革命理论的批判与斗争。关于高等学校的科学研究工作应如何进行，在这方面我们缺乏经验，总感到领导关系问题始终没有得到有力的支持和合理的解决。杨秀峰部长发言中谈到高等学校和科学院、各业务部门合作开展科学研究工作问题的意见是很好的。譬如中央戏剧学院的“中国戏曲史”教研组、“中国话剧运动史”教研组就希望中国科学院来加以领导和合作，这不仅可以满足科学院对这方面科学研究工作的需要，也可以提高学院科学研究水平，适应学院教学需要。
    关于培养研究生和博士生的任务是异常艰巨的，对于年轻的戏剧学院说来，也是缺乏经验。如果按照杨秀峰部长所提意见：“培养研究生和博士生的任务，应由科学院同高等教育部在国家统一计划指导下，统一安排，共同订立培养计划；在招收和培养工作方面，也要互相配合，以便合理地使用导师的力量。”这样的作法是行得通办得到的，我同意这样的办法。
    在展开科学研究工作的同时，必须改善教师的工作和生活条件。学院的房荒问题也很严重，教学人员因为没有房子不能结婚或延期结婚的不只一、二人，三代同房的人也不是个别的，大人、小孩、吃饭、睡觉、学习、备课挤在一个房间更是普遍的了。我们有一个干部宿舍，在我院说来是最好的一个宿舍。原是收买的民房，都是四合院的形式，按自然间计算，包括厕所、厨房共110间，每间仅有10平方公尺，住有55家约200余人，其中有小孩89个。院子小，人口多，小孩多，整个宿舍就等于是一个儿童活动场，教师既不能安静的睡觉和休息，也缺乏安静的地方备课。有了科学研究的时间，也缺乏进行科学研究的环境。这个问题已屡向领导上反映，但直到现在仍未解决。财政方面的负责同志总说没有钱，没有房子解决不了。俗话说得好：“百闻不如一见”。我希望文化部领导上派人去学院看看教师的住房情况，就知道房荒问题的严重性了。1955年文化经费又有结余，果真是没有钱呢，还是有了钱当用不用影响了工作呢？我希望有关单位检查一下，积极关心教师的工作条件和生活条件的改善，以利教学和科学研究工作的展开。
    另外，剧场问题这对我院说来，等于工科大学的实验室、医学院的附属医院一样的重要，可是我院原来筹建起来的一个实验剧场都拨给其他单位了。
    第三，虽然学院在文化部、高教部的领导下取得了一些成绩，但是我们对于高教部的领导是不够满足的。高等艺术学校确有其特殊性，但是它和一般的高等学校有着许多共同的地方，如何将普通高等学校科学研究、系室教研领导的经验运用于新办的艺术院校，除了靠我们自己努力摸索创造经验外，更迫切的需要高教部大力加强领导，使我们能更快的脱离机关式的作风，早日走上正规化的高等学校轨道。
    中央戏剧学院还是一个年轻的高等学校，希望各个高等学校给我们大力支持与督促，使年轻的弟弟能够更快的成长起来。
