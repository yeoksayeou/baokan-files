Expanding Irrigation Area in Jiangsu Through Water Conservancy Projects

Nanjing dispatch from our newspaper: Jiangsu Province has achieved great success in this year's large-scale spring farmland water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics from mid-May, the province has expanded its irrigated area by 5.16 million mu, improved irrigation of 6.8 million mu, and improved drainage of 14.81 million mu. The area of farmland expanded and improved for irrigation this year is equivalent to more than one-third of the province's original irrigated area.

The vast majority of water conservancy projects in Jiangsu Province this year are small and medium-sized, and were built by the farmers themselves. The province has trained and cultivated 20,000 district and township water conservancy technicians, who also used methods such as visits, internships, and apprenticeships to teach farmers to master engineering technical standards. The quality of this year's projects has greatly improved compared to previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 5th: More than 3,000 small farmland water conservancy projects built in Heilongjiang Province have been completed by the end of May, and 70% of the projects have begun to release water to irrigate rice paddies. The largest of these projects can irrigate 3,000 hectares of paddy fields, and the smallest can supply water for 20 to 100 hectares of paddy fields. All the water conservancy projects will irrigate the 100,000 hectares of newly reclaimed paddy fields in the province this year.

These projects were built by members of agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places in the past winter and spring, braving the severe cold and cold winds, and have received state assistance. Industrial and supply and marketing departments have also supplied a large number of power-driven water pumps, waterwheels, and other materials. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has trained more than 26,000 water conservancy technicians for the cooperatives. The technicians at each pumping station are now staffed by these technicians.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, June 5th: Yunnan Province's largest reservoir, the Xihe Reservoir, was completed yesterday.

Located on the Xihe River, a tributary of the Nanpan River, this reservoir can store 30 million cubic meters of water, irrigate 70,000 mu of farmland, and protect 6,000 mu of land on both sides of the Nanpan River from flooding.

    兴修水利工程
    江苏扩大灌溉面积
    本报南京讯　江苏省今年规模浩大的春修农田水利工程，获得很大成绩。据五月中旬的不完全统计，全省共计扩大灌溉面积516万亩，改善灌溉面积六百八十万亩，改善排水面积1，481万亩，今年扩大和改善灌溉的农田面积，就相当于全省原有灌溉面积的三分之一以上。
    江苏省今年的水利工程绝大部分是中小型的，是依靠农民群众自己动手兴建的。全省共训练、培养了二万个区、乡水利技术人员，他们并且用参观、实习、带徒弟等办法，教会了农民群众普遍掌握工程技术标准。今年的工程质量比往年有很大提高。三千多处水利工程放水灌田
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　到五月底，黑龙江省修建的三千多处小型农田水利工程已经全部完工，其中有70％的工程开始放水灌溉稻田。这些工程中规模最大的可以灌溉三千公顷水田，最小的能供应二十到一百公顷水田的用水。全部水利工程将灌溉今年全省新开出的十万公顷水田。
    这些工程，都是各地农业生产合作社的社员们在去冬今春冒着严寒和冷风修建的，并且得到了国家的帮助。工业部门和供销部门还供应了大批动力抽水机、水车等物资。省水利局共为合作社训练了二万六千多名水利技术手，现在各抽水站的技术员都是由这些技术手担任。
    云南修成一座大水库
    据新华社昆明5日电　云南省目前最大的一个水库——西河水库已经在昨天修成。
    这个位于南盘江支流西河上的水库，可蓄水三千万立方公尺，灌溉七万亩农田，还可使南盘江两岸六千亩田地免除洪水的灾患。
