To the Editor:

    In Luodian Buyi Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, the average wheat yield this year reached over 100 jin per mu. This is a great event for the local farmers, because they rarely grew wheat in the past. In recent years, they planted some, but the yield was very low. This year, the yield per unit area of wheat is about 50% higher than last year, and the total output is expected to increase more than twofold compared to last year. In the Bamao District, where people were not accustomed to growing wheat in previous years, 3,118 mu of wheat were planted this year, with the planting area expanding more than tenfold compared to last year. According to the statistics of the 640 mu of wheat land that has been harvested, a total of more than 79,000 jin of wheat were harvested, with an average yield of more than 120 jin per mu. At the same time, according to reports from various places, the "Dwarf Grain Multiplier" wheat promoted this year has an average yield of more than 250 jin per mu, which is about twice as high as the yield of ordinary wheat. The "Dwarf Grain Multiplier" wheat of the Five-Star Cooperative in Heping Township has an average yield of 300 jin per mu, and the high yield reached an average of 500 jin per mu.
    The main reason for this year's bumper wheat harvest is the development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the county, with various agricultural cooperatives improving the cultivation system and increasing the application of fertilizer. For example, the Five-Star Cooperative in Heping Township applied 24 loads of base fertilizer per mu of wheat, and the wheat fields were generally hoed and watered twice. At the same time, improved varieties were also used. The People's Government transferred 80,000 jin of wheat seeds from Anshun, Huishui and other places, including more than 20,000 jin of the "Dwarf Grain Multiplier" improved variety, which solved the difficulty of seed shortage in production and strongly supported farmers' production.
    Now, the farmers in our county are preparing to keep all the "Dwarf Grain Multiplier" wheat for seed, striving for a greater harvest next year. In addition to keeping some for their own use, all the remaining wheat will be sold to the state to support national industrial construction.

    罗甸布依族自治县小麦丰收编辑同志：
    贵州省罗甸布依族自治县，今年麦子每亩产量平均达一百斤以上。这在当地是一件大喜事，因为这里的农民过去很少种小麦，近几年来种了一些，产量也很低。今年小麦的单位面积产量比去年高出50％左右，总产量预计比去年增产二倍强。在往年不习惯种小麦的八茂区，今年种了麦子3，118亩，播种面积比去年扩大十多倍；根据已收割的六百四十亩麦地的统计，共收麦子七万九千多斤，每亩平均产量一百二十多斤。同时，据各地反映，今年推广的小麦“矮粒多”，每亩平均产量二百五十斤以上，比一般麦子的产量要高一倍左右；和平乡五星社“矮粒多”小麦每亩平均产三百斤，高额产量每亩平均达五百斤。
    今年小麦获得丰收的原因，主要是由于全县农业合作化运动的发展，各农业社改进了耕作制度，增施了肥料。如和平乡五星社每亩麦子放底肥二十四挑，麦地普遍薅、淋了两道，同时也改用了优良品种。人民政府从安顺、惠水等地调来麦种八万斤，其中“矮粒多”良种二万多斤，解决了生产中种子缺乏的困难，也有力地支持了农民生产。
    现在我县农民准备把“矮粒多”小麦全部留下做种，争取明年更大丰收。其余的小麦除了留一部分自用以外，全部卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。
