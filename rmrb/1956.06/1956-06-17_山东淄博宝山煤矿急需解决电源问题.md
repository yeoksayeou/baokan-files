    Shandong Zibo Baoshan Coal Mine urgently needs to solve power supply problems
    To the Editor:
    The Baoshan Coal Mine of Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong is encountering many difficulties in production due to the lack of a power supply.
    Currently, all underground machinery in the Baoshan Coal Mine is steam-powered, including three steam winches, twenty steam pumps, and two thousand six hundred meters of steam pipes. Because the steam engines exhaust a large amount of hot steam, the temperature underground is very high. In the summer of 1955, the temperature in the mechanical areas and some roadways was above 40 degrees Celsius. This seriously affects the health of the workers working underground. Although the coal mine leadership has tried to improve ventilation equipment and provide workers with cooling medicines, ice popsicles, and soda, the problem still cannot be completely resolved.
    The drainage work in the Baoshan Coal Mine also faces many difficulties. As the mining and excavation area of the coal mine expands, the water inflow is increasing day by day. Currently, all drainage equipment uses steam pumps. Due to insufficient steam supply, flooding accidents often occur. Especially this year, the contradiction between the expanded mining area and insufficient drainage capacity is becoming more acute.
    The excavation workface of the Baoshan Coal Mine is all manual labor. For example, the underground cart pullers, in coal seams only six or seventy centimeters high and on workfaces as long as one hundred meters, pull willow baskets with a capacity of eighty kilograms back and forth. The working conditions are very poor. As a result, many workers have already suffered from arthritis, back pain, leg pain, and gastrointestinal diseases.
    The above situation shows how urgent it is to solve the power supply problem for the Baoshan Coal Mine. However, although the Zibo Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Zibo Mining Bureau have reported this issue to the relevant leadership departments several times, and the local labor department and the East China Coal Mine Administration have also come to the mine for inspections, there is still no news of a resolution. Now, the daily output of coal at the Baoshan Coal Mine has dropped from 500 tons to just over 200 tons, and a production shutdown crisis is looming. It is hoped that the relevant leadership departments will quickly resolve the power transmission problem of the Baoshan Coal Mine.　Zhang Futian

### 山东淄博宝山煤矿急需解决电源问题

    山东淄博宝山煤矿急需解决电源问题编辑同志：
    山东淄博矿务局宝山煤矿因为没有电源，生产中遭遇了很多困难。
    目前，宝山煤矿井下全部用汽动机械，有汽绞车三部、汽泵二十台、输汽管二千六百公尺。因为汽动机排出的热汽很大，井下温度就很高。1955年夏季机械场所和部分巷道温度在摄氏四十度以上。这就严重影响了井下工作的工人的健康。煤矿领导方面虽然设法改进了通风设备，并且发给工人清凉药品和冰棍、汽水等，但是问题仍然不能彻底解决。
    宝山煤矿排水工作中也有很多困难。随着煤矿采掘范围的扩大，涌水量也一天一天增加。目前排水设备都是用汽泵，由于供汽不足，常常发生淹井事故，特别是今年，采掘范围扩大和排水能力不足的矛盾更加尖锐了。
    宝山煤矿采掘工作面都是手工作业。像井下拉筐工人在六、七十公分高的煤层里和长达一百多公尺的工作面中，拉着容量八十公斤的柳条筐来回走，劳动条件很不好。因此，有很多工人已经患了关节炎、腰疼、腿疼、肠胃等疾病。
    以上情况说明，解决电源问题，对宝山煤矿说来是多么迫切的事情。但是，这个问题，虽然中共淄博市委会和淄博矿务局已经几次向有关领导部门反映，当地劳动部门和华东煤矿管理局也曾来矿作了检查，到现在还没有可以得到解决的讯息。现在宝山煤矿煤的日产量已经由五百吨降到二百多吨，眼看着就要发生停产的危机。希望有关领导方面迅速解决宝山煤矿的输电问题。　张福田
