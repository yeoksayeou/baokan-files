    Soviet Friendly Visiting Fleet in Shanghai
		Continues to Receive Shanghai People for Visits
    On the 22nd, the temperature in Shanghai reached over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In such hot weather, the people of Shanghai spent a meaningful day with the officers and soldiers of the Soviet friendly visiting fleet. Small boats on the Huangpu River shuttled back and forth, taking batches of visitors to the three Soviet warships adorned with colorful flags. Today's visitors to the Soviet fleet included Shanghai's literary and art workers, officers from various branches of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, and other members of the public. Among the literary and art workers were actors from film, drama, and Peking opera, writers, translators, and so on. Soviet friends took them to visit the library on the warship. The library contained many works by Chinese writers published in Russian, including works by Lu Xun, Lao She, and others. Everyone exchanged gifts and took photos as souvenirs on the ship.
		Visiting in Shanghai
    Some of the officers and soldiers of the Soviet friendly visiting fleet visited the Shanghai Industrial Production Exhibition and the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, and also toured the Shanghai urban area. At the Industrial Production Exhibition, Soviet sailor Jie Shen gave a demonstration of operating a Soviet-style lathe on the spot. They repeatedly praised the achievements in Shanghai's industrial construction. The salespersons of the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store warmly welcomed these distinguished guests. After the visit, the distinguished guests also bought some souvenirs, the most popular being Beijing specialty handicrafts, Hangzhou brocade, and Fujian lacquerware. A Soviet naval lieutenant bought a Chinese doll toy. When someone next to him asked who he was going to give it to, he blushed and said he was going to give it to his unborn child.
			Joyful Gathering with Children
    In the afternoon, at the Shanghai Children's Palace, seven hundred Young Pioneers and over seventy Soviet naval uncles held a joyful gathering. When the naval uncles arrived at the entrance of the Children's Palace, the Young Pioneers lined up at the entrance, blew their bugles, and beat their drums, paying high tribute to the naval uncles. The uncles were surrounded by the children to the main hall. A grand and warm welcome ceremony was held here. Little Chairman Zhao Yu-e, on behalf of all the Young Pioneers in the city, warmly welcomed the Soviet naval uncles. Soviet naval Colonel Hilkin, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the fleet, thanked the children for their warm hospitality, invited the children to be guests on their warships tomorrow, and gave the Young Pioneers gifts entrusted by the children of Vladivostok to the children of Shanghai. The Young Pioneers also gave their own handmade gifts to the naval uncles. After the welcoming ceremony, the Young Pioneers invited the naval uncles to watch the performances by the Little Companion Theater Troupe; invited the uncles to dance and play games with them. It wasn't until after five o'clock that the uncles said goodbye to the children reluctantly.
			Exciting Football Match
    The Soviet Pacific Fleet football team, which accompanied the Soviet friendly visiting fleet to visit our country, played a friendly match with the Shanghai football team at the Hongkou Stadium in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 22nd.
    More than 18,000 spectators in Shanghai watched this exciting match under the scorching sun of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. As soon as the match began, the Soviet team immediately attacked. The forwards often dribbled past the opponent's defense and shot, forcing the Shanghai team to defend nervously. In the first half, the Shanghai team scored a goal while the opponent was not paying attention. The second half was even more intense. The Shanghai team used wingers to lure the opponent's defenders far out, and then two inside forwards quickly rushed in and scored four goals in a row. After that, the Soviet team launched a fierce counterattack, and forward Podnyagov skillfully scored a goal under the opponent's tight defense. Finally, the Shanghai team scored another goal, ending the friendly match with a score of six to one.

    上海市一万八千多名观众在华氏一百度以上炎热的太阳光下，观看了这场精彩的比赛。球赛一开始，苏联球队立刻进攻。前锋经常带球闪过对方的防卫，进行射门，迫使上海队紧张地防守。上半场，上海队乘对方不注意的时候，踢进一球。下半场比赛更为激烈，上海队用边锋引诱对方后卫远出，然后两个内锋迅速冲进，接连踢进四球。此后，苏联球队猛烈反攻，前锋波德尼亚格夫在对方严密的防守下，巧妙地踢进一球。最后，上海队又踢进一球，以六比一结束这场友谊比赛。
