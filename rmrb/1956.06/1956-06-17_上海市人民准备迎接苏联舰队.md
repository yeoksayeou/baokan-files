    The People of Shanghai Prepare to Welcome the Soviet Fleet
    (Our Shanghai Dispatch, 16th) The people of Shanghai are preparing to welcome the distinguished guests visiting Shanghai - the Soviet fleet led by Vice Admiral V.A. Chekurov.
    On many buildings along the Bund of the Huangpu River in Shanghai, workers are installing tens of thousands of colored light bulbs, and some wharves and pontoons along the river have also been freshly painted. Performers are rehearsing programs to be performed for the distinguished guests. The children of the Shanghai Children's Palace are busy making gifts for their Soviet friends, including models of warships made by the children themselves, and red scarves embroidered with team emblems. The officers and soldiers of the People's Navy stationed in Shanghai are also busy preparing to receive their friends.
