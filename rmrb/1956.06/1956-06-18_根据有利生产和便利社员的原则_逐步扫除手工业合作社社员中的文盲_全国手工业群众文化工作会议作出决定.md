    Based on the Principle of Being Beneficial to Production and Facilitating Members
    Gradually Eliminate Illiteracy Among Handicraft Cooperative Members
    National Handicraft Mass Culture Work Conference Makes Decision
    (Our Newspaper's report) The National Handicraft Mass Culture Work Conference, convened in Beijing from the 4th to the 9th by the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives, decided to eliminate illiteracy among members of handicraft cooperatives (groups) across the country within five to seven years. The conference focused on exchanging and summarizing experiences in illiteracy elimination work from various regions and studied the issue of further developing cultural and educational work in handicraft cooperatives.
    According to incomplete statistics, there are approximately 3.52 million illiterate and semi-literate people in handicraft cooperatives (groups) across the country, accounting for about 75% of the total number of existing members (groups).
    The conference believes that the illiteracy elimination work of handicraft cooperatives must be carried out in accordance with the characteristics of the industry, based on the specific conditions of each cooperative, and in accordance with the principles of being beneficial to production and facilitating members, adopting a variety of forms of schooling. In general, schools can be run by the cooperatives themselves, or by several cooperatives jointly. They can also be run jointly with workers, peasants, and urban residents. For members who cannot persist in attending school, door-to-door teaching and guaranteed teaching and learning can also be adopted. The illiteracy elimination work of handicraft cooperatives must also implement the teaching policy of "members teaching members," mainly mobilizing people in the cooperatives with a certain level of education and enthusiasm for illiteracy elimination work to serve as illiteracy elimination teachers. In addition, family members of the members and people outside the cooperatives can also be hired as teachers.
    In order to smoothly carry out illiteracy elimination work, the conference also studied the unified arrangement of production, learning, meeting and recreational and sports activities time of the grassroots cooperatives.
    The conference also discussed the development of cultural and sports work in handicraft cooperatives and established the China Handicraft Cooperative Sports Association at the meeting.

    根据有利生产和便利社员的原则
    逐步扫除手工业合作社社员中的文盲
    全国手工业群众文化工作会议作出决定
    本报讯　五年到七年内扫除全国手工业合作社（组）社（组）员中的文盲，这是全国手工业合作总社筹备委员会四日到九日在北京召开的全国手工业群众文化工作会议上决定的。会议着重交流和总结了各地扫除文盲工作的经验，并研究了在手工业合作社中进一步开展文化教育工作的问题。
    据不完全统计，全国手工业合作社（组）中有文盲半文盲约352万人，占全国现有社（组）员总数的75％左右。
    会议认为：手工业合作社扫除文盲工作必须按照行业的特点，根据各社的具体条件，本着有利生产和便利社员的原则，采取多种多样的形式办学。一般的可以采取以社办学或几个社联合办学，也可以和职工、农民、城市居民混合办学。对不能坚持到校学习的社员，还可以采取上门教学和包教保学等形式。手工业合作社的扫盲工作，还必须贯彻执行“以社员教社员”的教学方针，主要动员合作社中有一定文化程度、热心扫盲工作的人担任扫盲教师。此外，也可以聘请社员家属和社外人士为教师。
    为了顺利地开展扫除文盲工作，会议还研究了基层社的生产、学习、会议及文娱体育活动时间的统一安排等问题。
    会议还讨论了开展手工业合作社的文化体育工作问题并在会上成立了中国手工业合作社体育协会。
