We fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee, and Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives. We suggest that the congress approve these two reports and ratify the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives.

Our financial budget is fully in line with socialist industrialization and the general tasks of the transition period. In particular, every penny is taken from the people and used for the people, allocated for the benefit and happiness of the 600 million people. This kind of financial budget and final accounts can only be formulated under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government. In order to successfully complete our financial budget, we must rely on the hard work and production of industry, agriculture, and handicraftsmen, and the intellectuals' march towards science, working together in a concerted effort.

In order to better realize our financial budget, we would now like to offer some opinions based on what we learned during our recent inspection. From May 18th to the beginning of this month, we, along with CPPCC member Lin Zhongyi, inspected the Douhe Reservoir project, heavy industry, light industry, handicrafts, three types of advanced agricultural cooperatives, and fishery production cooperatives in Tangshan City, Tangshan Special District, Changli County, Hebei Province, and Tianjin. The actual situation of these inspections shows that China's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture have achieved great success and are continuing to develop by leaps and bounds. First of all, we were greatly encouraged by the observation and practice of learning. For example, the Douhe Reservoir project in Tangshan City, in order to protect the industrial city and irrigate farmland, nearly 40,000 laborers and technicians worked together, forgetting themselves in labor, which is truly moving. In terms of industrial production, such as the Qixin Cement Company, after public-private joint ownership, production increased by 18.6%, commodity costs decreased by 13.02%, profits expanded to 135%, and labor productivity increased by 28.11%. In the first quarter of this year, according to the planned targets, output was completed by 105.48%, output value was completed by 106.33%, labor productivity was completed by 103.98%, and commodity costs decreased by 16%. Others such as Tangshan Steel Plant, Tangshan Huaxin Cotton Textile Factory, Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory, Knitting Factory, Renli Wool Textile Factory, etc., have gradually increased production, gradually reduced costs, and gradually expanded profits under the conditions of technical innovation and labor competition, and strive to complete the tasks of the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target in 1956. In agriculture, the development of the cooperative movement in the 10 counties of Tangshan Special District, from the high tide of cooperation in just a short period of time from December last year to January this year, merged and transformed from more than 20,000 original primary cooperatives into 1,146 advanced cooperatives. After a short period of rectification and consolidation, they were divided into 676 first-class cooperatives, 404 second-class cooperatives, and 66 third-class cooperatives. From the perspective of the entire special district, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has reached 99.83% from the original 46.83% of the total peasant households. Moreover, the vast majority of the cooperatives are good, and the classification of the actual situation of the three types of cooperatives that we have understood is completely correct. Therefore, more than 90% of the cooperative members can increase their income. This shows that the rapid development and progress of industry and agriculture that we have seen are generally healthy under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government at all levels. However, in the process of development, some shortcomings and problems will inevitably arise. Some of these shortcomings and problems can be solved by the responsible comrades of the local Party and government. We have exchanged opinions with them and they can be gradually solved according to the specific situation, so there is no need to elaborate here. In addition to submitting the more important issues related to the central government to the Standing Committee for review in writing, we would like to report a few more prominent issues to the congress as follows, and request the attention and concern of the relevant departments:

    First, regarding the issue of financial allocations:

    All the administrative leaders at the local level or the responsible comrades of the enterprise departments that we contacted unanimously reflected that the financial departments' budget allocations to the local or enterprises in the past were not timely. It is always tight first and then loose, and it is also necessary to complete the budget expenditure tasks within a limited time, which causes many difficulties in the work. For example, quarterly allocations are often only allocated at the end of the quarter, but whether it is the purchase of equipment or the measures for construction projects, they cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, it is often too late to use the funds, and the time has passed, which will inevitably affect the production plan and the development of construction projects, and cannot well complete the task of the financial budget, causing losses to the country. This should be noted by all levels of responsible departments in charge of finance.

    Second, regarding the problem of Tangshan Qixin Cement Company, it is explained in five points:

      (1) Regarding the company's problem of eliminating dust.

    The company was originally located in Tangshan City, with eight ash-mixing rotary kilns. Only three of them had imperfect dust collection equipment. As a result, as much as 105 tons of dust flew from the chimneys into the sky above Tangshan City every day, which caused serious losses to national property and endangered the health of citizens (citizens dare not wear white clothes in summer). The company had reported to the higher authorities, but the higher authorities did not pay attention to it. After the inspection in Beijing last winter by Ma John and other representatives, the matter was reported to the Standing Committee and submitted to the attention of the competent department, namely the Bureau of Building Materials Industry of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, but it has not been dealt with so far. The bureau also replied that it had sent engineers to inspect and had put forward four methods to exchange opinions with the responsible comrades of the company, and ordered the company to gradually solve it. However, during our re-inspection this time, the person in charge of the company told us that the Bureau of Building Materials Industry had not sent anyone to inspect and exchange opinions at all. We believe that such an irresponsible work style in the central leading organs should be improved.

      (2) Regarding the lack of accurate planning for the increase or decrease of cement production.

    According to the company's reflection, in the first half of 1955, the central competent department gave the company an increase in production tasks. The workers and masses launched a labor competition, and the enthusiasm for production was very high. Until July, they were still working hard. In August, the central government suddenly instructed to reduce production, which was like pouring cold water on the workers' heads. By the end of 1955, everyone thought that cement had no market, but in early January 1956, news of an increase in production suddenly came from the central government. The factory had to start the machines in a hurry, so it did not complete the clinker plan well, which reduced product quality. In the second half of 1955, production was reduced by more than 40,000 tons, causing great losses, and workers and cadres had complaints. This shows that the central competent department lacks comprehensive consideration and foresight in controlling cement production plans, which puts the production units below in a passive position, hinders production enthusiasm, and hinders the development of production. Lessons should be learned from this.

      (3) Regarding the exploitation of new and old mines.

    The company's old mine has been mined for many years and has reached the point where it should be closed. If it continues to be excavated, it will be extremely unsafe. It has also reported to the higher authorities long ago, but it has not attracted attention. This spring, a serious accident occurred in which a skilled technician was crushed to death, and the workers and masses were deeply dissatisfied. After inspection by Soviet experts, it was considered that the old mine should no longer be used, but for the needs of the facts, it can only be reluctantly opened until the end of this year and should be stopped. Therefore, in January 1957, it is necessary to take raw materials from the Beijiadian new mine that has been discovered long ago. However, the preparation work for the development of the Beijiadian new mine should have been carried out since the joint venture in 1954, but the design work of the Central Design Institute has been repeatedly delayed, delaying the time. In particular, the company does not have the strength for technical design, and the Central Design Institute does not provide assistance, so that preparation work has not yet been carried out. According to the responsible comrades of the company, if the central competent department cannot help solve this problem immediately, the Beijiadian mine will not be able to produce raw materials. If cement production has no raw material supply in 1957, it will inevitably face the danger of being forced to stop work. In the period when a large number of construction projects are needed, what kind of losses will the consequences of stopping cement production bring to the country! It is necessary to remind the competent departments here to pay serious attention.

      (4) Regarding the problem of heavy physical labor.

    In the company's production, 43.7% of the workers are engaged in heavy physical labor of pushing carts and loading cars manually. The efficiency is poor, and the workers' health is also seriously affected. Some people have already suffered from hematemesis. The solution is the mechanization of the transportation process. According to the person in charge, if the mechanization of transportation is realized, 1,128 manual laborers can be reduced. In addition, adding some auxiliary equipment, renovating and expanding the weak links, and giving full play to the potential of production, if these problems are solved, and comprehensive planning and arrangements are made at the same time, and dust collection equipment is properly done, it may be increased from the current annual output of 600,000 tons to an annual output of 1 million tons, an increase of 400,000 tons per year. It is estimated that the investment is about 20 million yuan, and the investment can be fully recovered after two and a half years, which is more economical and easier than building a new cement plant with an annual output of 400,000 tons. The above-mentioned suggestions of the company for improving production and developing business are specially requested to be considered by the competent departments.

      (5) Regarding the issue of workers' wages, dormitories and welfare.

    The company has not undergone major reforms in workers' wages since liberation, so the wage system is still extremely chaotic. The wages of skilled workers are low. The approval of the higher competent department stipulates that it cannot exceed 1.46% of the total wage in 1955. However, according to the calculation results, the total wage must be increased to at least 3.34% to be more reasonable. We believe that according to the speech of representative Liu Ningyi, the central government is very concerned about this issue, and we think that the company's wages will inevitably be resolved more reasonably.

    Regarding workers' welfare, we believe that it is generally not done well enough. However, the company has accumulated a welfare fund of 630,000 yuan since the joint venture. In addition to production rewards, it originally planned to build 100,000 yuan of workshops, 200,000 yuan of single dormitories and changing and shower facilities this year, but cement was needed. It applied to the higher authorities, but was not approved, and it did not specify what other alternative materials were available for building workshops and dormitories, so they could not construct, and could not solve the workers' life and welfare problems. The workers were buried in dust all day long, but they could not get clean bathing places and adequate housing. This shows that the central competent department does not care enough about the workers' life and welfare. Therefore, the workers said: "With so little cement, we can produce it with more effort. If it is said that cement is not enough, why did you ask us to reduce production last year?" We believe that this handling method does not seem very reasonable.

    Third, the problem of Tangshan Steel Plant.

    The plant's site is crowded and the heat source is full. Last summer, due to the lack of cooling and ventilation equipment in the workshop, the workers fainted and were forced to stop work for several days. To date, ventilation and cooling equipment has not been installed according to the plan, which affects the health of workers and also affects production. Because the sanitary conditions of the plant are too poor, there is no place to rest when the night shift is over. Some workers sleep on the ground or in the bathroom. Moreover, workers have no dormitories far from home when changing shifts. In addition to the round-trip time, they can only rest for three or four hours. Lack of sleep, and the work is particularly heavy, and the general health is not very good. Many workers suffer from various occupational diseases. According to the technicians of the plant, the Central Iron and Steel Industry Administration has never come to the plant to deeply understand the situation, and often only issues production tasks from a document, lacking specific leadership and assistance, so many problems of the plant cannot be solved in time. For example, the supply of iron, coking coal and steel ingot molds is not available, which makes production uncoordinated and forms a passive situation and affects the smooth development of production.

    The competent department's control over the plant's technical measures funds is too strict, and funds are often allocated only at the end of the quarter, and urged to spend it within a limited time, which makes it too late for the plant to purchase equipment according to the plan, which is very inconvenient and also affects the development of production, and the workers and masses are deeply dissatisfied.

    Fourth, the cement supply problem of the Douhe Reservoir project.

    The newly built Douhe Reservoir in Tangshan City is to protect the heavy industrial city of Tangshan and the production and water conservancy of the surrounding rural areas, which is very important. Their task must be completed before the rainy season comes at the end of June. After surveying by Soviet experts, when tunneling the water diversion tunnel, the rock quality of the area is loose and should be reinforced with cement grouting. Therefore, the original plan for cement was insufficient. The comrades in charge of the construction site requested the central government for allocation three times, and the Tangshan Municipal People's Committee forwarded the request twice, but the central competent department did not approve it, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. It was not until May 20th that Mayor Quan Zhemian personally came to Beijing to negotiate before the problem was solved. Although this is a problem that has passed, the Bureau of Building Materials Industry of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has taken a dismissive attitude towards the supply of materials that is urgently needed for the benefit of industrial and agricultural production. Such bureaucratic style is worthy of attention and improvement in the future.

    Fifth, regarding the issue of migrant workers' wages.

    With the development of national economic construction, it is undeniable that a large number of migrant workers need to be mobilized to undertake this important task in various local construction projects. However, due to the simultaneous arrival of the high tide of advanced agricultural production cooperation and high yield in rural areas, the labor income of cooperative members has gradually increased, which shows that the wages of migrant workers are too low. According to the responsible comrades of Tangshan Special District, the wages of migrant workers are 80 cents per person per day according to regulations, 40 cents are credited to the agricultural cooperative, and 40 cents are for the individual to eat food (of course, it is very insufficient. After paying a high degree of labor, each person has to eat 2.5 catties of grain per day). The agricultural cooperative still pays the members who work as migrant workers according to the labor days. The income per labor day of the agricultural cooperatives in the special district is mostly around 3 yuan, and there are many that exceed 3 yuan. The migrant workers' wages of 80 cents are too different, which affects the income of the agricultural cooperative and all its members. Because our construction cause is long-term, if this continues, it may make the assignment of labor in the future difficult. This is of course a national problem. The central government has made a decision to increase workers' wages. Should the wage standards for migrant workers also be adjusted appropriately according to the different situations in various places, so as to avoid excessive disparity with the labor remuneration of agricultural cooperatives? We specially ask the central competent department to consider it.

    在视察中受到了最大鼓舞
    ——刘清扬、吴昱恒、马约翰代表的发言
    我们完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，彭真副委员长关于常务委员会的工作报告以及廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明。并建议大会通过这两个报告和批准高级农业生产合作社示范章程。
    我们的财政预算是完全符合于社会主义工业化建设和过渡时期总任务的。尤其每一个钱都是取之于民用之于民，为了六亿人民的利益幸福而支配。这也只有在共产党毛主席和人民政府的正确领导下，才能制定出这样的财政预算和决算。为了胜利完成我们的财政预算，必须由工业、农业、手工业者的努力生产，和知识分子向科学大进军，共同一致奋斗努力。
    为了更好的实现我们的财政预算，现在我们就这次出外视察所了解的情况发表一点意见。由5月18日至本月初，我们同林仲易政协委员到河北省唐山市、唐山专区昌黎县及天津市等处视察了陡河水库工程、重工业、轻工业、手工业和三个类型的高级农业合作社以及渔业生产合作社，从这些视察的实况来看，显示了我国社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造事业获得了伟大的成绩，而且正在继续突飞猛进地向前发展中，首先就使我们在观察实践的学习上受到最大的鼓舞。例如唐山市的陡河水库工程，为了保护工业城市和灌溉农田，将近4万名的民工和技术人员共同努力，忘我的劳动，实在令人由衷地感动。工业生产方面如启新水泥公司，从公私合营后，生产量增加了18.6％，商品成本降低了13.02％，利润扩大到135％，劳动生产率提高了28.11％。今年第一季度按照规定计划，产量完成了105.48％，产值完成了106.33％，劳动生产率完成了103.98％，商品成本降低了16％。其他如唐山钢厂，唐山华新棉纺织厂，天津印染厂、针织厂、仁立毛纺厂等等，都在技术革新、劳动竞赛的条件下，产量逐步提高，成本逐步下降，利润逐步扩大，并争取于1956年内，提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的任务。而农业方面，唐山专区10个县，仅从去年12月到今年1月短短的时间中，合作化高潮的发展，就由原来两万多个初级社合并转成1，146个高级社。并经过短时间的整顿巩固工作，分成第一类社676个，二类社404个，三类社66个。从全专区来讲，入社农户由原来占总农户的46.83％已达到99.83％。而且好的社占绝大多数，经我们了解三个类型社的实际情况的分类完全是正确的。因此90％以上的社员都能增加收入。这说明我们所看到的工业和农业的迅速发展前进，在各级党和人民政府的正确领导之下，一般是健康的。然而在发展进程中也不免会带来若干缺点和问题，有些缺点和问题是地方党政负责同志可以解决的，我们已和他们交换了意见，可由他们根据具体情况逐步解决，在这里不必详述。其与中央有关而比较重要的问题，除以书面报由常务委员会审查外，兹提出几个较为突出的向大会汇报如下，并请各有关部门关怀注意：
    一，关于财政拨款问题：
    我们所接触到的无论地方行政领导或企业部门负责同志，都一致反映，认为过去财政部门对于地方或企业的预算拨款是不及时的。总是先紧后松，又要限期完成预算支出任务，致使工作遇到很多困难。例如季度拨款，常到季度末款才拨出，但无论是购置器材或建设事业的措施，都不是短时期所能办到的，因此往往来不及使用此款，而时间已经过去了，这就必然会影响了生产计划和建设事业的发展，而且不能很好地完成财政预算的任务，使国家遭受损失，这是各级负责掌管财务的部门应该注意的。
    二，关于唐山启新水泥公司的问题，分作五个问题来说明：
      （1）关于该公司消灭粉尘的问题。
    该公司自始是设在唐山市内的，有八座拌灰旋窑，只有三座有了不完善收尘器的设备，因之每日要从烟筒中飞散于唐山市上空的粉尘有105吨之多，损失国家资财，妨害市民健康至为严重（市民夏天不敢穿白衣）。该公司曾向上级反映，上级未予置理，去年冬马约翰代表等视察回京后，报经常务委员会提交主管部门，即重工业部建筑材料工业管理局的注意，而迄今仍未处理。该局并复函说曾派工程师前往检查，已提出四种办法与该公司负责同志交换意见，责成该公司逐步解决。但在这次我们再次视察时，据该公司负责人告诉我们，建筑材料工业管理局根本并未派人前往检查和交换意见。我们认为在中央领导机关这样不负责任的工作作风，是应该注意改进的。
    （2）关于水泥生产的增减缺乏准确计划问题。
    据该公司反映，1955年上半年中央主管部门给该公司以增产任务，工人群众展开劳动竞赛，生产的劲头很大，直至7月间还在热烈地努力，8月中央忽指示减产，这等于在工人头上浇一瓢冷水，到1955年终大家还以为水泥没有销路，但1956年1月初，中央突然又传来了增产的消息，厂方只好仓促地开动机器，因而没有很好的完成熟料计划，致降低产品质量，并于1955年下半年减产达4万多吨，受了很大损失，工人和干部都有怨言。这说明中央主管部门掌握水泥生产计划，缺乏全面考虑的预见性，使下面生产单位陷于被动，既妨碍生产情绪，也妨碍了生产的发展。是应该吸取的教训。
    （3）关于新旧矿山的开采问题。
    该公司旧矿山开采多年，已到了采尽封矿的时期，如再继续挖掘，便极不安全，也曾早向上级反映，并未引起重视，今春即曾发生了压死一个老练技术工人的严重事故，工人群众深为不满。经苏联专家代为检查，认为旧矿已不该使用，但为事实需要，也只能勉强开到本年年底即应停止。因此1957年1月份必须要从早已发现的卑家店新矿山采取原料。但关于卑家店新矿山的开采准备工作，从1954年合营后即应进行准备工作，只因中央设计院的设计工作一再迁延，耽误了时间。特别是技术设计该公司无此力量，而中央设计院又不予以协助，以致至今还未进行准备工作。据该公司负责同志说：如果中央主管部门不能即时帮助解决这个问题，卑家店矿山就不能生产原料，1957年水泥生产既无原料供应，势必有被迫停工的危险。这对于大量建设建筑事业的需要时期，停工生产水泥的后果将给国家带来如何的损失！有必要在这里提请主管部门应严肃注意的。
    （4）关于繁重体力劳动的问题。
    该公司在生产中有43.7％的工人作推车和人力装车的繁重体力劳动，效力既差，工人的健康也有严重影响，现已有人患呕血症。解决的办法是运输过程的机械化。据负责人反映：如果实现了运输机械化，可减少体力劳动工人1，128名，另外增添一些附属设备，对薄弱环节加以改建和扩建，使生产潜在力量充分发挥出来，这些问题如解决，同时加以全面规划和安排，并做好收尘设备，可能由现在年产60万吨增加到年产100万吨，一年增加40万吨，据估计投资2，000万元左右，两年半后即可完全收回投资，比新建一座年产40万吨的水泥厂，是省而且容易的多。以上该公司对于改进生产和发展业务的建议，特提请主管部门加以考虑。
    （5）关于工人工资、宿舍和福利问题。
    该公司于解放后到现在，工人工资无大改革，故工资制度仍极混乱，技术工人工资较低，经呈请上级主管部门的批示不能超过1955年工资总额的1.46％，但据计算的结果，起码工资总额须加到3.34％，才能作到较为合理。我们认为根据刘宁一代表的发言，中央对这一问题，是非常关怀的，想对该公司的工资必然会予以较合理的解决。
    关于工人福利方面，我们认为普遍是作得不够的。但该公司从合营后，已积累福利基金63万元，除作生产奖励外，本打算今年盖10万元的工房，20万元的单身宿舍和更衣淋浴设备，但就需要水泥，曾向上级申请，未得到批准，又不指明有何其他代用材料，可供修建工房宿舍之用，使他们无法施工，以致不能解决工人的生活福利问题，工人在灰尘中埋头终日，竟得不到清洁的洗浴场和相当的住所，这说明中央主管部门对工人的生活福利不够关心，因此工人们说：“用这么一点水泥，只要我们多加努力就生产出来了，如果说水泥不够供应，为什么去年要我们减产呢？”我们认为这种处理办法，似乎是不大合理的。
    三，唐山钢厂的问题。
    该厂场址拥挤，热源满布，去年夏季因车间缺乏降温吹风设备，致使工人晕倒，被迫停工数日，迄今仍未按照计划安装通风降温设备，既影响工人健康，同时也影响了生产。因该厂卫生条件太差，夜班散值时没有休息场所，有的工人睡在地上或睡在浴室，而且在倒班时工人无宿舍离家太远，除往返时间只能休息三、四小时，睡眠不足，工作又特别繁重，一般身体都不很好，有不少工人患各种职业病。据该厂技术人员反映：中央钢铁工业管理局从来未有人到该厂深入了解情况，往往只是从一纸公文下达生产任务，缺乏具体领导帮助，所以该厂有不少问题不能及时解决，例如铁、焦煤和钢锭模子供应不上，使生产不能协调，形成被动而影响生产的顺利发展。
    主管部门对该厂技术措施经费控制过严，也是往往到季度末才拨款，而又催促必须限期花完，使厂方来不及按计划购买设备，感到极大不便，也就影响了生产发展，工人群众深为不满。
    四，陡河水库工程水泥供应问题。
    唐山市新建陡河水库，是为保护唐山重工业城市和沿岸农村的生产水利的，关系非常重要，他们的任务必须赶在雨季到来以前6月底完成。经苏联专家勘察，开凿输水洞时，因该地山石质松，应以水泥灌浆加固，因此原计划水泥不敷应用，由工地负责同志三次向中央请拨，并由唐山市人民委员会两次转请，中央主管部门未予批准，引起群众不满，直到5月20日由权哲民市长亲自来京交涉，才得解决。这虽是已经过去的问题，但重工业部建筑材料工业管理局对于一个关系工、农业生产利益迫不及待的物料供应问题，竟以漠视态度不予重视，这样官僚主义的作风，是值得今后注意改进的。
    五，关于民工工资问题。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，地方各项修建工程需要大量发动民工担任此重大任务，是不容怀疑的。但由于乡村间农业生产合作高级化和高产化的高潮一齐到来，社员的劳动收入逐步提高，因之显示了民工工资过低的现象。据唐山专区负责同志反映民工工资按照规定每人每日八角钱，四角归农业社入账，四角归本人吃伙食（当然很不够，付出高度的劳力后，每人每天要吃二斤半粮食），农业社对作民工的社员，仍按劳动日计酬。该专区各农业社每个劳动日收入大都是三元左右，而且超过三元的也还不少，民工工资八角就相差太多，致影响农业社和全体社员的收入。因为我们的建设事业是长期的，长此这样下去，可能使将来的派工会发生困难的，这当然是全国性的问题，中央对工人工资已有提高的决定，关于民工工资标准是否也应根据各地不同情况酌予调整，以免与农业社的劳动报酬过于悬殊，特提请中央主管部门予以考虑。
