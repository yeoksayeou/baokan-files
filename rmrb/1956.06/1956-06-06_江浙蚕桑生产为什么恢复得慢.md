Why is the Recovery of Silkworm Production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Slow?
Ji Nong

The spring silkworm rearing plans in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have only been completed by about 97% this year. If leadership is not strengthened, it will be difficult to complete the annual silkworm production plan.

Since 1937, due to the destruction of the war, the mulberry garden area in the two provinces has sharply decreased. According to statistics in 1950, the mulberry gardens only accounted for slightly more than 41% of the 3.73 million mu before the war, and the cocoon production only accounted for about 20% of the 2.01 million dan before the war. Since liberation, silkworm production has recovered to a certain extent, but the recovery rate has not been fast. Comparing 1955 with the period before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the mulberry garden area was only 54% of that before the war, and the cocoon production was only equivalent to 35% of that before the war.

The reason why silkworm production cannot be restored and developed rapidly, in addition to the objective reasons that silkworm production itself requires large investment and slow returns, is mainly because some leading organs do not pay enough attention to silkworm production and lack regular and effective leadership. The general situation of the leadership is: arrangements are made during planting and cocoon collection, but little attention is paid to the cultivation of mulberry gardens and the raising of silkworms at ordinary times. Some places even oppose increasing grain production and developing silkworm production, resulting in a large number of serious phenomena of cutting down mulberry trees in the work of expanding the area of grain crops, changing the farming system, and building water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics in Jiangsu Province, more than 10,000 mu of mulberry gardens have been destroyed since last winter. Tianhuadang area in Chongde County, a famous silkworm producing area in Zhejiang Province, changed 3,000 mu of mulberry gardens and other specialty crop fields to paddy fields this year in order to strive for grain self-sufficiency. Deqing County cut down 20,000 mulberry trees to build rural roads.

Due to the lack of attention to silkworm production by the leading organs, the problem of the low cocoon purchase price has not been properly resolved for a long time. The cocoon-rice price ratio in 1937 was 1 to 13.33, but now it is 1 to 7.98. The cocoon price has fluctuated high and low in recent years. Although the cocoon price this year is 15.12% higher than in 1950, it is only equal to the level of 1952. In addition, the cocoon quality required by the standard cocoon price has increased by 29.26%, and the actual cocoon price has only increased by about 1%. Comparing the cocoon price with the silk price, it can also be seen that the cocoon price is low. In recent years, the price of silk has been increasing year by year. Taking 1950 as 100, the silk price has now increased by 30.37%, the satin price has increased by 56% to 90.73%, and the silk quilt cover price has increased by 139%. Due to the low cocoon price, the income of farmers engaged in silkworm production is not as high as the income from agricultural production. In 1955, the average income per mu of mulberry garden in Zhejiang Province was 28.5 yuan. In high-yield areas such as Wuxing and Deqing counties, it was 45.75 yuan, and in low-yield areas such as Jiaxing County, it was 16.57 yuan. The average in Jiangsu Province is 43 yuan. These figures are all lower than the income from agricultural production. According to a survey by Chenjiawei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, each mu of mulberry garden produces 10 dan of spring leaves. Calculated on the basis of 115.6 jin of cocoons produced throughout the year, the average reward per labor day is 1.375 yuan; while double-cropping rice produces 800 jin of rice per mu, and the average reward per labor day is 2.1 yuan.

The unreasonable price of cocoons first damages the enthusiasm of farmers for silkworm production. Currently, there are many missing plants in silkworm gardens, and the situation of intercropping with other crops is very serious. According to statistics in Zhejiang in 1955, the area of mulberry gardens intercropped with other crops was 850,000 mu, accounting for more than 57% of the mulberry garden area. The situation of intercropping other crops in mulberry gardens in Jiangsu is roughly the same as in Zhejiang. This situation has caused very unfavorable effects on the mulberry gardens. As the saying goes: "If you want the mulberry garden to be barren, one crop of vegetables, one crop of wheat." In addition, various places do not cultivate the mulberry gardens very well, and the special fertilizers supplied to the mulberry gardens are also diverted to the paddy fields. In this way, the mulberry gardens are increasingly withered and the yield is declining. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, each mu of mulberry garden in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area produced about 2,000 jin of mulberry leaves, but now it only produces about 500 jin. Secondly, because the income from silkworm production is lower than the income from agricultural production, some agricultural cooperatives have to lower the contracted work points for silkworm production. At present, the work points contracted for one silkworm egg sheet are generally 100 to 110 points, while in fact a medium-sized laborer spends 26 days raising one silkworm egg sheet and should get more than 130 work points. Precisely because of this, some commune members are unwilling to engage in silkworm production, and some agricultural cooperatives cannot contract out the work.

Further developing silkworm production is of great significance for supporting national industrial construction and increasing farmers' income. Party committees in areas with silkworm production, especially in concentrated production areas, should put silkworm production in its proper important position and earnestly strengthen their leadership over it. All localities should formulate active and reliable silkworm production plans according to needs and possibilities. The problems of low cocoon prices and excessive purchase and sale price differences must be seriously resolved in order to ensure that the income of farmers engaged in silkworm production is not lower than the income from agricultural production. All localities should take appropriate measures to develop mulberry gardens, especially to increase the yield per unit area of existing mulberry gardens, such as reducing the "fixed production" figures for intercropping grain in the original mulberry gardens, and mobilizing farmers not to intercrop other crops in the mulberry gardens; for newly developed mulberry gardens and mulberry gardens formed by transplanting and merging scattered mulberry trees, agricultural taxes should be reduced or exempted as appropriate during the period when there is no or little income to encourage development. As long as we "strengthen leadership and make comprehensive plans" and properly solve these problems, silkworm production can be restored and developed more quickly.

    江浙蚕桑生产为什么恢复得慢
    济农
    江苏、浙江两省今年的春蚕饲养计划，只完成了97％左右，如不加强领导，全年蚕桑生产计划很难完成。
    1937年以后，由于战争的破坏，两省桑园面积锐减，据1950年统计，桑园只占战前373万亩的41％强，产茧量只占战前201万担的20％左右。解放以来，蚕桑生产有了一定的恢复，但是恢复的速度是不算快的。拿1955年和抗战前比较，桑园面积仅有战前的54％，产茧量只相当于战前的35％。
    蚕桑生产所以不能迅速地恢复和发展，除了蚕桑生产本身的投资大、收益慢这一客观原因外，主要是由于某些领导机关对蚕桑生产重视不够，缺乏经常和有效的领导。领导方面的一般情况是：在定种、收茧的时候布置一下，平常对于桑园的培育和蚕的饲养很少过问。甚至有个别地方把增产粮食和发展蚕桑生产对立起来，以致在扩大粮食作物面积、改变耕作制度、兴修水利等工作中，发生了大量砍伐桑树的严重现象。据江苏省的不完全统计，去冬以来被毁掉的桑园有一万多亩。浙江省有名的蚕桑产区——崇德县天花荡地区，今年为了争取粮食自给，竟把三千亩桑园和其他特产田全部改为水稻田。德清县为了修筑乡村道路，砍掉了二万株桑树。
    由于领导机关对于蚕桑生产重视不够，蚕茧收购价偏低的问题长期得不到适当的解决。1937年茧米比价是一比十三点三三，现在却是一比七点九八。几年来的茧价忽高忽低，今年茧价虽然较1950年调高15.12％，也只等于1952年的水平，加上标准茧价所要求的茧质提高了29.26％，实际上茧价只调高约1％。把茧价和丝绸价比较一下，也可看出茧价是偏低的。几年来，丝绸的价格逐年提高。如以1950年为一百，那么现在丝价调高了30.37％，绸价调高了56％到90.73％，丝被面价格调高了139％。由于茧价偏低，农民从事蚕桑生产的收入就不如从事农业生产的收入多。1955年浙江省平均每亩桑园的收入是28.5元，高产区如吴兴、德清等县是45.75元，低产区如嘉兴等县是16.57元。江苏省平均是43元。这些数字都比农业生产的收入低。据浙江德清县陈家圩农业生产合作社调查，每亩桑园产春叶十担，以全年产茧115.6斤计算，平均每个劳动日所得的报酬是1.375元；而双季水稻每亩产稻谷八百斤，每个劳动日的报酬平均是2.1元。
    蚕茧价格不合理首先损伤了农民对于蚕桑生产的积极性。目前蚕园缺株很多，间作其他作物的情况很严重。据浙江1955年统计，桑园间作其他作物的面积有八十五万亩，占桑园面积57％以上。江苏的桑园间作其他作物的情况也和浙江大体相同。这种情况给桑园造成了很不利的影响。正像俗语所说：“若要桑园荒，一熟蔬菜、一熟麦。”另外，各地对于桑园也不很好地培育，把供应给桑园的专用肥料，也移用在水稻田里去。这样，桑园便日益衰萎，产量下降。抗日战争以前，杭嘉湖地区每亩桑园产桑叶二千斤左右，现在大约只产五百斤。其次，因为蚕桑生产收入低于农业生产收入，有些农业合作社便不得不压低蚕桑生产的包工工分。目前一张蚕种所包的工分，一般的是一百分至一百一十分，而实际上一个中等劳动力花二十六天时间饲养一张蚕种，应得一百三十个工分以上。正因为这样，有些社员不愿从事蚕桑生产，有些农业合作社包工的时候包不下去。
    进一步发展蚕桑生产，对于支援国家工业建设和增加农民收入都有重大意义。有蚕桑生产的地区，特别是集中产区的党委，应该把蚕桑生产摆到应有的重要地位上来，切实加强对它的领导。各地应该根据需要和可能，制定积极可靠的蚕桑生产规划。对于茧价偏低、购销差价过大问题，要认真解决，以便保证农民从事蚕桑生产的收入不低于农业生产的收入。各地应该在发展桑园特别是提高现有桑园单位面积产量方面，采取适当措施，如核减原桑园内间作粮食的“定产”数字，动员农民不在桑园里间作其他作物；对于新发展的桑园和由零星桑树移栽归并而成的桑园，在没有收益或收益很少的期间，应该酌情减免农业税，以鼓励发展。只要“加强领导，全面规划”，妥善解决这些问题，蚕桑生产是可以更快地恢复和发展的。
