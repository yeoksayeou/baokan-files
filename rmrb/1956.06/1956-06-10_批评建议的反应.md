Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    Xu Xuejin, Deputy Director of the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau, writes: The article "The Illusion of the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau" published in the "Reader's Letters" section on April 22nd criticized our bureau's incorrect attitude towards criticism. We sincerely accept this criticism and have instructed relevant comrades to conduct further reviews. We will also use this review to educate our staff to overcome complacency and correct their attitude towards criticism. In addition, our leadership will improve and establish various systems to strengthen ideological education.

We have already dealt with this issue: the land has been returned to the local agricultural cooperative for cultivation without compensation, and the individuals involved have been criticized or subjected to Party disciplinary action.
