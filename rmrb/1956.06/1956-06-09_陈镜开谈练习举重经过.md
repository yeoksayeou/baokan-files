Xinhua News Agency:

    Chen Jingkai, the 20-year-old who broke the world record for the clean and jerk in the bantamweight class in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 7th, spoke to reporters in the athletes' lounge of the Shanghai Municipal Gymnasium on the evening of the 7th about his weightlifting training.

    When Chen Jingkai was studying at the South China United Middle School in Guangzhou, he was a well-known athlete in the school. He is not tall, but he likes gymnastics, basketball, football, swimming, and other sports. After graduating from junior high school in 1953, he stopped attending school and studied at home. Whenever he had time, he would go to the public stadium to exercise. In January 1955, he joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Life in the army was intense and enjoyable, and it provided good conditions for practicing weightlifting. Through diligent study and hard training, his weightlifting performance improved rapidly. In March 1955, he represented the "August 1st" weightlifting team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the 1955 National Weightlifting Test. He clean and jerked 95 kilograms and had a total score of 245 kilograms, ranking seventh in the bantamweight class. In June 1955, Chen Jingkai was selected as a member of the Chinese Youth Weightlifting Team to participate in the Second International Youth Games in Warsaw. When he passed through Moscow, he received guidance from Soviet weightlifting coaches Pustovoit and Osipov. In three or four months, his total score increased by 42.5 kilograms. After returning to China, he was admitted to the Beijing Institute of Physical Education.

    Chen Jingkai told reporters that he has been enrolled for less than nine months and has already learned some knowledge of mechanics and physiology. He practices weightlifting based on this knowledge, and he makes significant progress every month.

    Chen Jingkai participated in this friendly competition between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Shanghai Municipal Weightlifting Team against the Soviet Weightlifting Team. In his first clean and jerk attempt, he lifted 125 kilograms, which was 5 kilograms more than the national record he had set last year. The second time, he prepared to lift 133 kilograms, but he failed because he was too nervous. In the third attempt, he finally lifted the barbell, which weighed more than twice his own weight. People immediately presented flowers to this first Chinese athlete to break a world record.

    Chen Jingkai said that this glory should belong to the motherland.

    新华社讯　七日下午在上海打破最轻级举重双手挺举世界纪录的二十岁的陈镜开，七日晚在上海市体育馆运动员休息室对记者谈他练习举重的经过。
    陈镜开在广州市华南联合中学学习的时候，就是学校里出名的运动健将。他的个子不高，但他对体操、篮球、足球、游泳等项运动都喜欢。1953年初中毕业以后停学在家里自学，一有空就到公共体育场去锻炼身体。1955年1月，他参加了中国人民解放军。在部队里，生活紧张愉快，有着练习举重的良好条件。经过勤学苦练，他的举重成绩进步很快。1955年3月，他代表中国人民解放军“八一”举重队参加1955年全国举重测验。他双手挺举九十五公斤，总成绩是二百四十五公斤，获得最轻级第七名。1955年6月，陈镜开被选为中国青年举重队队员去华沙参加第二届国际青年运动会。经过莫斯科的时候，他得到了苏联举重教练员普斯特沃依特和奥西波夫的指导。三、四个月后，他的总成绩就提高了四十二点五公斤。回国以后，他考入北京体育学院。
    陈镜开告诉记者说，他现在入学不到九个月，已经学到一些力学和生理方面的知识，根据这些知识练习举重，每个月都有显著进步。
    陈镜开参加这次中国人民解放军和上海市举重联队同苏联举重队举行的友谊比赛，第一次挺举就举起一百二十五公斤，比他自己去年保持的全国纪录增加了五公斤。第二次，他准备举一百三十三公斤，因为过分紧张，没有举起来。在第三次，他终于把比他体重超过一倍以上的杠铃举起来了，人们立即把鲜花献给这位中国第一个打破世界纪录的运动员。
    陈镜开说，这个光荣应该属于祖国。
