Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 10th: It was announced here on June 9th that on June 6th, the same day that Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Bulganin wrote to U.S. President Eisenhower, he also wrote to British Prime Minister Eden, French Prime Minister Mollet, and West German Chancellor Adenauer. The letters requested them to carefully study the Soviet government's May 14th statement on the reduction of 1.2 million troops (including the reduction of troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic), and also requested these countries' governments to take practical actions to contribute to the cause of consolidating peace and European security.

At the same time, it was reported that Bulganin also wrote a letter to Italian Prime Minister Segni.

In his letters to Eden and Mollet, Bulganin respectively mentioned that the recent Soviet-British and Soviet-French talks had unanimously emphasized that the issue of disarmament should be resolved. Bulganin said that in the current situation where the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee has not achieved any results in discussing the issue of disarmament, major countries bearing primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security should take the lead in taking practical and feasible measures to reduce armaments and armed forces without waiting for the conclusion of an international disarmament agreement.

In his letter, Bulganin expressed his hope that after the Soviet Union announced its disarmament, the British and French governments would also take corresponding steps. He also expressed his hope that the United States, Britain, and France would also reduce their armed forces stationed in Germany, in order to lead to an agreement on significantly reducing armed forces stationed in Germany or withdrawing foreign troops from Germany.

In his letter to Adenauer, Bulganin emphasized that if other countries also took measures to reduce their armed forces like the Soviet Union, this would greatly help solve the issue of German reunification. The letter requested the West German government to make practical contributions to the cause of consolidating peace and European security, so that West Germany's development would not violate the interests of European security and would not promote the intensification of the arms race.

    布尔加宁分别写信给英法等国政府首脑
    希望西方国家也采取裁军的实际行动
    新华社莫斯科10日电　此间六月九日宣布，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在六月六日写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔的同一天里，分别写信给英国首相艾登、法国总理摩勒和西德总理阿登纳。信里要求他们仔细研究苏联政府五月十四日发表的裁军一百二十万人（包括裁减在民主德国的驻军）的声明，并且要求这些国家政府也采取实际行动，来对巩固和平和欧洲安全事业作出贡献。
    同时，有消息说布尔加宁还写了一封信给意大利总理塞尼。
    布尔加宁在给艾登和摩勒的信里，分别提到最近苏英、苏法会谈都一致着重认为应该解决裁军问题。布尔加宁说，在目前联合国裁军小组委员会讨论裁军问题没有得到什么结果的情况下，对维护国际和平和安全负有主要责任的大国应当率先采取裁减军备和武装部队的切实可行的措施，而不必等待达成国际裁军协定。
    布尔加宁在信中表示希望在苏联宣布裁军以后，英国和法国政府也采取相应步骤。他并且表示希望美、英、法三国也裁减它们驻在德国的武装部队，以导致就大大裁减驻在德国的武装部队或是从德国撤退外国军队达成协议。
    布尔加宁在给阿登纳的信中着重指出，如果其他国家也像苏联一样采取裁减武装部队的措施，这将大大有助于解决统一德国的问题，这封信要求西德政府对巩固和平和欧洲安全事业做出切实的贡献，使西德的发展不要违反欧洲安全的利益，不要促使加紧扩充军备。
