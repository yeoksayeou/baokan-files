    A Master of Increasing Alcohol Production
    ——Remembering Comrade Su Guojin's Use of Black Mold for Qu
    Ye Shengtao
    At the end of 1952, Comrade Su Guojin graduated from Zhejiang University and was assigned to work at the Jinan Alcohol Factory as a technician in the Qu-making workshop.
    The Jinan Alcohol Factory is currently the largest alcohol factory in China, with its main and branch factories using over 200,000 jin of sweet potato chips as raw material every day. To make alcohol from sweet potato chips, the chips are first boiled until softened, then Qu is added to convert the starch in the sweet potatoes into sugar, and then yeast is added to convert the sugar into alcohol. Qu-making involves cultivating mold on steamed wheat bran. The mold contains many saccharifying enzymes that can convert starch into sugar. With over 200,000 jin of sweet potato chips as raw material every day, more than 30,000 jin of Qu are needed.
    The Jinan Alcohol Factory has two main production workshops. One is the fermentation workshop, which converts starch into sugar and then into alcohol. The other is the Qu-making workshop. The fermentation workshop has already been mechanized. The Qu-making workshop, however, is almost entirely operated manually. Comrade Su Guojin thought that many alcohol factories pay attention to yeast, considering it the main key to the amount of alcohol produced, but Qu-making is just as important. If the mold does not grow well on the wheat bran, the starch in the raw material cannot be completely converted into sugar. If there is less sugar, even if the yeast is good, the alcohol production cannot be increased. During the mold's growth process, different stages require different temperatures and humidity, and it is not easy to regulate this manually. Furthermore, the workers are too tired. The Qu-making room is hot and humid, and constantly running in and out makes it easy to catch a cold. Over the years, arthritis can also develop. To change this situation, the Qu-making workshop must also be mechanized.
    Comrade Su Guojin thought that the Qu-making room should have equipment for automatically adjusting the temperature, and sprayers and ventilation fans should be used to adjust the humidity. The Qu in wooden trays often needs to be flipped up and down, with the trays on top being moved down and the trays on the bottom being moved up. This is too labor-intensive, and an automatic conveyor belt should be used instead of wooden trays. He had not learned about mechanized Qu-making in school, and it took him a lot of thought to draw the mechanical sketches. At this time, he studied the General Line and understood that the country should first develop heavy industry. For general light industries, it was required to fully utilize the potential of existing equipment, increase production, and accumulate funds. The leadership also repeatedly explained the country's policies to him. According to his design, all twelve existing Qu-making rooms would have to be rebuilt, which would cost a lot of money. How could this be done? He abandoned this unrealistic idea and began to help workers improve operating methods and labor organization.
    The original operation of Qu-making in the Jinan Alcohol Factory was as follows: After the wheat bran was steamed and sterilized, it was mixed with seed Qu (mold for making seed) and placed in wooden trays in the Qu-making room. A stack of more than ten wooden trays was placed there. Once the Qu was ready, the stacks of wooden trays were moved upstairs, and the Qu was poured out to dry. Each Qu-making room had two batches of Qu, one semi-finished and one newly made. Comrade Su Guojin thought that the mold needed different temperatures and humidity in the early and late stages of growth, and it was not a good idea to put two batches of Qu together. The workers were too tired to move stacks of empty wooden trays downstairs and finished products upstairs. The door of the Qu-making room was opened and closed frequently, and the temperature and humidity were not easy to maintain. He improved the operating method. Only one batch of Qu was placed in a Qu-making room, starting and finishing at the same time. The finished Qu was poured out of the trays in the Qu-making room, packed into sacks, and moved upstairs. In this way, not only could the temperature and humidity be adjusted appropriately with the growth of the mold, but also there was no need to move the wooden trays downstairs and upstairs. The number of wooden trays could be reduced by half, and the workers' physical labor was greatly reduced. Also, because there was no need to run in and out as often as before, the number of people catching colds was also reduced. The quality of the Qu produced was much better than before.
    Comrade Su Guojin also used his brain to increase production. He thought that to increase alcohol production, the starch in the sweet potatoes must be fully utilized. To fully utilize the starch, better Qu must be made to convert almost all the starch into sugar. He began to think about the types of mold. Generally, alcohol factories use yellow mold for Qu-making, and the Jinan Alcohol Factory also used yellow mold. There are many types of yellow mold. Comrade Su Guojin found more than twenty types of yellow mold to test and compare, to see which one had the strongest saccharifying enzyme power and produced the most alcohol. Finally, he found three relatively good ones, but they were not much different from the ones used in the factory at that time. One day, Comrade Su Guojin saw a piece of news in the Soviet "Microbiology Journal" that the Soviet Union had adopted liquid Qu-making (that is, letting mold reproduce in liquid). He thought that the factory cooked sweet potato chips, adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and doubled the amount of water added, and the result was very good.
    Why can't Qu-making learn from the Soviet Union? Liquid Qu-making requires mechanical equipment, which is not possible at present, but besides this, are there no other experiences to learn from? He searched everywhere for Soviet technical data on alcohol manufacturing. However, there were almost no books on the alcohol industry in the bookstores. After searching for a long time, he finally found a book in the original language by the Soviet Klimovsky, "Alcohol Manufacturing Technology."
    At this time, Comrade Su Guojin had not been self-studying Russian for long and could not understand the book in the original language. He thought, how can I wait until I have learned Russian to read it? The production task is so tight, I must find a way to understand the book. He took a dictionary, looked up the words one by one, looked up all the new words in a sentence, and then pondered the meaning of the whole sentence. Of course, it was very difficult to read the book in this way, but he believed that he could definitely find a way to improve production in this book. No matter what, he had to bite the bullet and read the chapter on mold carefully. He did not interrupt for a day, reading page by page, and finally found the direction to obtain excellent mold. The book said that it is better to use black mold to make Qu than to use yellow mold. The saccharifying enzyme of black mold is heat-resistant and acid-resistant, and its power is also strong. Comrade Su Guojin felt as if he had discovered a treasure, and immediately looked up and read all the sections on black mold clearly, and also found some information about black mold from other books and magazines. After careful research, he asked the leadership to let him do experiments to try it out. The leadership supported his request.
    The factory leadership wrote to the Beijing Academy of Sciences Germplasm Preservation Committee and asked for black mold. He first did small-scale experiments. Black mold had also been used by others, but there had been no exchange of experience, and no records of black mold Qu-making could be found. Comrade Su Guojin had to start from scratch and grope in the dark. He failed twice in a row, and did not know why black mold wheat bran Qu was always growing badly. At this time, it was the New Year, and Comrade Su Guojin did not bother to play, burying his head at home to check relevant data and compare it with the records of the two failures. He found that he used the method of cultivating yellow mold wheat bran Qu to cultivate black mold wheat bran Qu, ignoring the characteristics of black mold. Black mold needs higher temperature and humidity than yellow mold when it grows. After the New Year, he started the experiment again, raising the temperature and adding more water. In this way, black mold really grew well on the wheat bran. He used this black mold to do comparative experiments with yellow mold. The result was that the alcohol content of fermentation using black mold Qu was generally 0.3% to 0.4% higher than that of using yellow mold Qu. Then he did five more experiments, and the results were good. Once it increased by 10%.
    In 1955, the Jinan Alcohol Factory had a heavy production task. The superiors not only required the factory to complete the state plan, but also required it to increase alcohol production by 150 tons without increasing raw materials. In the first two months, the factory's production situation was not very good, and none of the plans were completed. Everyone in the factory was anxious. Therefore, the leadership paid more attention to Comrade Su Guojin's research. Seeing that his experiment was initially successful, they immediately made a decision, requiring the entire factory to support his Qu-making experiment, and also gave him research time and necessary equipment, and allocated him a room. Making Qu in an ordinary room is very different from cultivating Qu in a glass bottle culture room. In a glass bottle culture room, the temperature is easy to control, the humidity does not change much, and miscellaneous bacteria in the air are not easy to enter. In the room, not only is the temperature difficult to maintain, but also the moisture is easy to evaporate, and there is no way to prevent miscellaneous bacteria in the air. Comrade Su Guojin did not consider these, thinking that the experiment in the glass bottle culture room had been successful, and there would be no more difficulties. Unexpectedly, after four trials, none of them succeeded. The Qu made was like a dead dough, very firm, with only a little white hyphae on the surface, and all the hearts were gray. Some people said: "The small amount of experiment is not yet grasped, and it is even more difficult to control during mass production. It is better to use yellow mold as before!"
    Comrade Su Guojin was very depressed. He was afraid that if mass production was carried out in the future, there would be more difficulties, which would cause great losses to the country. In addition, he had been tense for more than ten days in a row, and his spirit was very tired, and his confidence was a little shaken. But in a blink of an eye, he felt that he must not fail the expectations and encouragement of the leaders and the masses. The blackboard newspaper was urging him, "Comrade Su Guojin, everyone is waiting for your final success!" His young assistant Zhang Bingqi told him about Wang Zhiqiang's research on enamel at Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory, saying: "Wang Zhiqiang failed more than 200 times before he succeeded. What is it that we have only failed four times?" The factory director sent several experienced workers to help him. The Party Committee Secretary also talked to him, encouraging him to persist in the experiment, saying: "When you encounter difficulties, you must show courage. You can discuss with the workers." This sentence reminded Comrade Su Guojin, "Yes, I only care about burying my head in research alone, why don't I discuss with everyone? The problem is obvious, still on temperature and humidity. I have to discuss with everyone, what method to use to maintain temperature and increase humidity."
    Comrade Su Guojin took the initiative to consult with experienced workers and related technicians. Black mold needs a lot of water, and if there is less water, reproduction will be slow. If reproduction is slow and growth is not vigorous, the room temperature will easily drop. So open the heating pipes to raise the temperature. But once the heating pipes are opened and the temperature is raised, the room becomes drier, and the black mold grows even worse. The worker Zhang Bingqi suggested to Comrade Su Guojin that the amount of water added to the wheat bran should be more before Qu-making. At that time, Comrade Su Guojin had already added eleven taels of water per jin of wheat bran. Zhang Bingqi said that it might as well try adding twelve taels of water per jin of wheat bran to see what the result would be. Comrade Su Guojin adopted this suggestion. When the room temperature dropped, they sprayed steam directly into it instead of turning on the heating pipes to heat up. They also sprayed water on the walls and sprinkled water on the ground to fully maintain the humidity of the space. Under such an arrangement, the experiment was surprisingly successful. The Qu made was soft and loose, just like a sponge cake, and turned black inside and out, indicating that the black mold grew very well on the wheat bran. So, in cooperation with the workers in the fermentation workshop, three alcohol fermentation tests were carried out with 400 jin of raw materials. The results of the three tests showed that the starch alcohol production rate reached 54.4% (calculated based on the starch contained in sweet potato chips and wheat bran Qu, that is, 100 jin of starch can produce 54.4 jin of alcohol), which was not only higher than the yield using yellow mold, but also exceeded the national planned targets.
    The experiment of using black mold to make Qu was finally successful, and the leadership immediately decided to start mass production. At this time, it was already the end of May, the weather was very hot, and the air was dry. Comrade Su Guojin adopted the suggestion of worker Zhang Lelin to spray water on the Qu to maintain humidity, and the Qu was still made very well. On June 4, the fermentation workshop began to officially use black Qu for production. Four days later, the first vat of alcohol was made, and each 100 jin of starch produced 53.19 jin of alcohol, exceeding the factory's production increase and savings plan target by 1.16 jin. Comrade Su Guojin finally breathed a sigh of relief. From November of the previous year to this time, from cultivating black mold in small test tubes to producing the first vat of alcohol, he had been busy for more than seven months, and had done a total of forty-eight large and small Qu-making and alcohol fermentation experiments. He recalled that during these seven months, there were several times when he almost gave up the experiment. Fortunately, the Party and the leaders often educated him, supported him, and the masses constantly encouraged him and helped him, so he persevered and succeeded. However, using black mold to make Qu for brewing alcohol is only the beginning. Experience is not enough, and confidence is not great. Many problems have not been completely solved. He thought that as long as he listened to the Party, studied humbly under the guidance of engineers, often studied together with workers and technicians, and often received the help of the Academy of Sciences Germplasm Preservation Committee and Soviet experts, these problems could definitely be solved one by one.
    The Jinan Alcohol Factory used black mold to brew alcohol. In just four and a half months in the second half of 1955, in addition to ensuring the completion of the state plan, it also increased alcohol production by 153.5 tons without increasing raw materials, saving more than 460,000 kilograms of sweet potato chips, and creating wealth of more than 205,000 yuan for the country. Now, many alcohol factories across the country have also adopted black Qu. Although the quality of black Qu is not as good as that of the Jinan Alcohol Factory, the starch alcohol production rate has increased a lot compared with the use of yellow Qu.

    增产酒精的能手
    ——记苏国进同志用黑霉菌制曲  
    叶圣陶
    1952年底，苏国进同志在浙江大学毕业，被分配到济南酒精厂工作，在制曲车间当技术员。
    济南酒精厂是我国目前最大的酒精厂，总分厂每天的原料要用白薯干二十几万斤。用白薯干做酒精，先把白薯干煮烂，加上曲，使白薯的淀粉变成糖，然后加上酵母，使糖变成酒精。制曲就是使霉菌在蒸熟的麸皮上繁殖。霉菌含着很多糖化酵素，能使淀粉变成糖。每天的原料二十几万斤白薯干，就得用曲三万多斤。
    济南酒精厂里最主要的生产车间有两个。一个是发酵车间，就是把淀粉变成糖再变成酒精的车间。一个是制曲车间。发酵车间已经机械化了。制曲车间呢，几乎全部还用手工操作。苏国进同志想，许多酒精厂都注意酵母，认为酵母是酒精产量多少的主要关键，可是制曲也同样重要。要是霉菌在麸皮上长得不好，就不能使原料里的淀粉全部变成糖，糖少了，酵母虽然好，酒精的产量也不能提高。霉菌在生长的过程中，各个阶段需要不同的温度和湿度，用人工来调节不是件容易的事。并且工人也太劳累，制曲室又热又湿，常常跑出跑进，很容易害感冒，年数多了，还会闹关节炎。要改变这种情况，非使制曲车间也机械化不可。
    苏国进同志想，制曲室应该有自动调节温度的设备，应该用喷雾机和通风机调节湿度。一木盘一木盘的曲时常要上下翻动，在上的木盘调下来，在下的木盘调上去，这太费人工，应该用自动传送带代替木盘。他在学校里并没学过机械化制曲，费了不少心思，才把机械的草图画出来。正在这时候，他学习了总路线，明白了国家首先发展重工业，对一般轻工业，要求充分发挥现有设备的潜力，提高产量，积累资金。领导上也屡次向他说明国家的政策。照他的设计，现有十二个制曲室要全部重建，要花很多钱，这怎么成呢？他就抛弃了这一套不切实际的想法，开始帮助工人改进操作方法和劳动组织。
    济南酒精厂制曲的操作原先是这样的：麸皮蒸熟和杀菌以后，拌了种曲（做种的霉菌）在制曲室里装入木盘，十几个木盘一叠，放在那里，曲做好了，一叠一叠的木盘搬到楼上去，把曲倒出来，让它干燥。每一个制曲室里都有两批曲，一批是半成品，一批是新制品。苏国进同志想，霉菌在生长的初期和后期，需要的温度和湿度不同，两批曲放在一起不是个好办法。工人把一叠一叠的空木盘搬下楼来，又把成品搬上楼去，太劳累了。制曲室的门一会儿开一会儿关，温度和湿度也不容易保持。他就改进操作方法。一个制曲室里只放一批曲，同时开始做，同时做好。做好的曲就在制曲室里倒出盘来，装入麻袋搬上楼去。这样一来，不但温度和湿度可以随着霉菌的生长适当调节，而且不用把木盘搬下楼搬上楼了。木盘的数量既可以节省一半，工人的体力劳动也大为减轻。又因不必像以前那样常常跑出跑进，害感冒的人也减少了。制出来的曲，质量却比以前好得多。
    苏国进同志又在增产方面动脑筋。他想，要使酒精增产，必须充分利用白薯里的淀粉。要充分利用淀粉，就得制出更好的曲，使淀粉差不多全部变成糖。他开始在霉菌的品种方面想办法。一般酒精厂制曲都用黄霉菌，济南酒精厂也用黄霉菌。黄霉菌有许多种。苏国进同志找二十几种黄霉菌来试验比较，看哪一种的糖化酵素力量最强，产酒精最多。最后找到了三种比较好的，但是跟当时厂里用的相差并不大。有一天，苏国进同志在苏联的“微生物学杂志”上看到一段消息，说苏联已经采用液体制曲了（就是让霉菌在液体里繁殖）。他就想到厂里煮白薯干，采用了苏联的先进经验，加水的分量增加了一倍，结果很好。
    制曲为什么不可以学习苏联呢？液体制曲要有机械设备，目前还做不到，但是，除了这一点，难道就没有别的经验可以学习吗？他就到处搜寻苏联制造酒精的技术资料。但是在书店里，讲酒精工业的书几乎没有，找了好久，才找到一本原文本的苏联克里蒙夫斯基所著的“酒精制造工艺学”。
    这时候，苏国进同志自修俄文没有多久，还看不懂原文本的书。他想，等学好了俄文再看，怎么来得及呢？生产任务这样紧，一定要想办法把书看懂。他就拿了本字典，一个字一个字地查，把一句话里的生字全查出来了，然后揣摩全句的意思。这样看书当然很吃力，但是他相信在这本书里一定可以找到提高生产的方法，无论如何要硬着头皮把霉菌这一章好好看下去。他一天也不间断，一页一页地往下看，终于找到了获得优良霉菌的方向。书上说，用黑霉菌制曲比用黄霉菌好。黑霉菌的糖化酵素能耐热耐酸，力量也强。苏国进同志像发现了宝藏似的，连忙把讲黑霉菌的一段全部查明白读清楚，还从别的书和杂志上找到了一些关于黑霉菌的资料。经过了仔细的研究，他要求领导让他做实验试一试。领导支持了他的要求。
    厂的领导写信给北京的科学院菌种保藏委员会，要来了黑霉菌。他先做小型试验。黑霉菌也曾经有人用过，但是不曾交流过经验，找不到黑霉菌制曲的记录。苏国进同志只有从头做起，暗中摸索。一连两次都失败了，不知道为什么黑霉菌制麸曲老是长不好。这时候正是新年，苏国进同志也顾不得玩了，埋着头在家里查看有关的资料，跟两次失败的记录作比较。他发现他用了培养黄霉菌麸曲的方法培养黑霉菌麸曲，忽略了黑霉菌的特性。黑霉菌在生长的时候，需要的温度和湿度都比黄霉菌高。过了新年，他又开始实验，提高了温度，又加多了水分。这样一来，黑霉菌果然在麸皮上长得很好。他就用这黑霉菌跟黄霉菌做比较试验，结果是用黑霉菌曲比用黄霉菌曲，发酵含酒量一般要高0.3％到0.4％。接着又做了五次试验，成绩都不错，有一次提高了10％。
    1955年，济南酒精厂的生产任务很重，上级不但要求这个厂完成国家计划，还要求在不增加原料的条件下增产酒精一百五十吨。开头两个月，厂里的生产情况不很好，都没有完成计划。全厂人人都着急。因此，领导上更重视苏国进同志的研究，见他的试验初步成功了，马上作出决定，要求全厂支持他试验制曲，还给他研究的时间和必要的设备，拨给他一间房间。在普通房间里制曲，跟在玻璃瓶里种曲室里培养，情形又大不相同。在玻璃瓶里种曲室里，温度容易控制，湿度不大会改变，空气里的杂菌也不容易进去。在房间里，不但温度难以保持，水分也容易蒸发，空气里的杂菌更没法提防。苏国进同志却没有考虑到这些，以为在玻璃瓶里种曲室里试验已经成功，再不会有什么困难了。不料试做了四次，一次也没有成功。做出来的曲好像死面块，很结实，只在表面上有一点儿白色的菌丝，心子里全都发了灰。有人就说：“小量试验还没有把握，大量生产的时候更加不容易控制了。还不如照旧用黄霉菌来得好！”
    苏国进同志很苦闷，他怕将来大量生产，困难会更多，会给国家造成很大的损失。加上他一连紧张了十几天，精神很疲倦，信心不免有点儿动摇了。但是一转念间，他觉得决不能辜负领导和群众对他的期望，给他的鼓励。黑板报正在督促他呢，“苏国进同志，大家等待你最后成功！”他的青年助手张秉齐给他谈山东新华制药厂王志强研究搪玻璃的经过，说：“王志强失败了二百多次，才得到成功。咱们只失败了四次，算得什么？”厂长派了几个有经验的工人帮助他。党委书记还找他谈话，鼓励他坚持试验，说：“碰到困难，更要拿出勇气来。你可以跟工人同志商量商量。”这句话把苏国进同志提醒了，“对啊，我只管一个人埋头钻研，为什么不找大家商量商量呢？问题很明显，还在温度和湿度上。我得跟大家商量商量，用什么方法来保持温度，提高湿度。”
    苏国进同志就主动地找有经验的工人和有关技术员商量。黑霉菌需要的水分多，水分少了，繁殖就慢。繁殖一慢，生长一不旺盛，室内的温度很容易下降。于是打开暖气管来提高温度。但是暖气管一开，温度一提高，室内更加干燥了，黑霉菌更加长不好了。工人张秉齐向苏国进同志提出建议，在制曲之前，麸皮里加水的分量还要多。当时苏国进同志已经给每斤麸皮加十一两水，张秉齐说不妨试一试，每斤麸皮加十二两水，看结果怎么样。苏国进同志采纳了这个建议。室内温度下降的时候，他们就把蒸汽直接喷进去，不开暖气管加温。他们又在墙上喷水，地上洒水，充分保持空间的湿度。在这样的安排下，试验居然成功了，做出来的曲又松又软，简直像鸡蛋糕似的，里里外外都发黑，这表明黑霉菌在麸皮上长得非常好。于是在发酵车间工人的配合下做了三次四百斤原料的酒精发酵试验。三次试验的结果，淀粉产酒率达到54.4％（以白薯干和麸曲所含的淀粉来计算，就是一百斤淀粉制成54.4斤酒精），不但比用黄霉菌产量高，而且超过了国家计划指标。
    用黑霉菌制曲终于试验成功了，领导上马上决定大量生产。这时候已经是五月底，天气很热，空气干燥。苏国进同志采纳工人张乐林的建议，在曲上喷水，保持湿度，曲照样做得很好。六月四日，发酵车间开始正式用黑曲生产，四天以后，第一缸酒精做出来了，每一百斤淀粉产酒精53.19斤，超过厂里的增产节约计划指标1.16斤。苏国进同志这才松了一口气。从前年11月到这时候，从用小试管培养黑霉菌到产出第一缸酒精，他一共忙了七个多月，大大小小的制曲和酒精发酵的试验一共做了四十八次。他回想这七个多月间，有好几次几乎放弃了试验，幸亏党和领导经常教育他，支持他，群众不断鼓励他，帮助他，他才坚持下来，得到成功。但是用黑霉菌制曲酿造酒精还只是开始，经验还不够，把握还不大，许多问题还没有完全解决。他想，只要听党的话，在工程师指导之下，虚心学习，时常跟工人和技术人员共同研究，时常得到科学院菌种保藏委员会和苏联专家的帮助，这些问题一定能够一个一个解决的。
    济南酒精厂用黑霉菌酿造酒精，仅仅在1955年下半年四个半月里，除保证国家计划的完成外，还在不增加原料的条件下增产酒精153.5吨，节约白薯干46万多公斤，为国家创造财富二十万五千多元。现在全国有许多酒精厂也采用了黑曲，虽然黑曲的质量还比不上济南酒精厂，但是比较用黄曲的时候，淀粉产酒率都提高了不少。
