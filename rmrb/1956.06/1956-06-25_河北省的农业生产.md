    Agricultural Production in Hebei Province
    —Speech by Representative Lin Tie
    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.
    As I participate in this conference, I recall the rapid progress our country has made in the high tide of the socialist revolution since the closing of the last conference, which makes me feel very excited and happy. Now, I would like to report to you on the new atmosphere in agricultural production in Hebei Province after the realization of complete socialist agricultural cooperativization, the existing problems, and future opinions.
    Cooperativized Households Account for 99.35% of Total Households
    According to statistics at the end of March this year, the province has a total of 23,807 advanced agricultural production cooperatives and 53 elementary cooperatives, with 8,313,961 households participating, accounting for 99.35% of the total households. The quality of the vast majority of cooperatives is good. From last winter to this spring, the cooperative movement and the production movement have been combined and promoted each other, forming an unprecedented upsurge of socialist transformation and socialist construction in rural areas.
    Farmland Water Conservancy Construction
    As everyone knows, spring drought and autumn floods have been the long-term natural laws of Hebei Province. Therefore, developing farmland water conservancy and strengthening water conservancy construction have become important keys to increasing agricultural production in our province. From last winter to the end of May this year, our province completed more than 720,000 various types of water wells, equivalent to twice the total number of wells dug in the past six years. Including the repair of old wells, the construction of small reservoirs, and canal banks, the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 16 million mu, a half-year achievement that has doubled the total irrigated area in our province's history. Here, I would like to briefly introduce the situation of Dazhaimen Village in Xingtai County in building a small reservoir. Dazhaimen Village in Xingtai County is a small mountain village with 117 households in the Taihang Mountains. Last winter, the entire village joined the advanced cooperative. The members discussed tapping production potential, and the best way was to expand the irrigated area, but the village's terrain was not suitable for digging wells. Later, according to years of experience, everyone found spring water under more than two zhang of rock layers. They used more than 10,000 workdays and used stones and cement to build an underground reservoir. This reservoir is 20 zhang long, more than 1 zhang wide, and more than 3 zhang deep, with a 30 zhang long underground channel. The top of the reservoir is covered with stones, and the top can also be used for farming. During winter construction, work did not stop when the snow was light, and when the snow was heavy, they rested and worked. They used the method of burning and breaking the large stones that could not be lifted. Before the reservoir was completed this spring, more than 70 mu of wheat were irrigated, and each mu could increase production by 40 to 50 jin. If the land is properly managed, more than 200 mu can be irrigated, and neighboring villages can also benefit. While building the reservoir, they organized semi-laborers to smoke tens of thousands of jin of coarse fertilizer. Other farm work was not delayed.
    From last winter to the end of May this year, the province completed a total of more than 1.72 million mu of afforestation on barren mountains and sandy land, more than 290,000 gully dams, 396 small reservoirs, more than 20,000 storage ponds, and more than 1.17 million mu of terraced fields in terms of soil and water conservation and gully management in mountainous areas. On the plains, 23.8 million mu of ditch and furrow field projects have been completed.
    Fertilizer Application Increased by More Than Double
    In the past, in general areas of our province, the annual fertilizer application per mu of land was about 2,000 jin of coarse fertilizer. Before spring sowing this year, the province accumulated about 850 billion jin of fertilizer. On average, more than 8,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu of spring white land. If various unrealistic factors are reduced and the actual fertilizer effect is estimated, the fertilizer application is at least more than double the annual fertilizer application last year.
    In terms of intensive cultivation and popularizing advanced experience, autumn plowing was carried out universally last year, and harrowing was done two or three times this spring. Before spring sowing this year, more than 200,000 agricultural cooperative technicians were trained. About 60% or more of the province's agricultural cooperatives have formulated technical operating procedures for local major crops.
    Cooperatives Achieve Unprecedented Summer Harvest
    Currently, the rural areas of the province are busy with summer harvest, summer planting, and summer weeding. The wheat yields of many cooperatives have achieved unprecedented harvests after actual collection and distribution. According to investigation and statistics, the total wheat output of the province this year can reach 4.1 billion jin, exceeding the provincial plan by 6.7%, exceeding the national plan by 15%, and increasing by 17% compared with last year; the average yield per mu exceeds the provincial plan by 4.5%, exceeds the national plan by 19.4%, and increases by 25% compared with last year. The 210,000 mu of wheat fields in Gaocheng County yielded an average of 320 jin per mu. The members said that this is "a good harvest that ancestors have never heard of." Judging from the summer harvest pre-distribution plans formulated by agricultural cooperatives in various places, most cooperatives can ensure that 90% of the members increase their income; only a small number of cooperatives, due to the joint township or joint village cooperatives implementing unified pre-distribution, some households in villages with more wheat fields have reduced income; or because the wheat field area has decreased compared with previous years; or because sideline businesses have not been done well; and individual cooperatives have reduced income due to excessive retention. Judging from the overall situation, we have followed the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on correctly handling the relationship between individual members and the collective, implemented the principle of less retention and more distribution, and most cooperatives can ensure that 90% of the members increase their income. Therefore, after discussing the summer harvest pre-distribution plan, the production enthusiasm of the members has been greatly encouraged, and the concerns of some members who previously thought that production could be increased but not necessarily distributed more have been dispelled. After the members of the Mizi Dian Township Cooperative in Tongxian County discussed the pre-distribution plan, the labor attendance rate increased from the original 70% to 90%.
    The achievements are great and the main aspect, but on the other hand, many mistakes and shortcomings have also occurred. Here, I would like to talk about some opinions on the following issues.
    Further Consolidate and Rectify Agricultural Cooperatives
    1. On the issue of further consolidating and rectifying agricultural cooperatives. In February this year, after our province achieved a decisive victory in the overall socialist transformation, various places universally carried out rectification work on agricultural cooperatives in the production movement, especially after implementing the joint instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and achieved good results. Non-productive expenditures have been reduced, the phenomenon of random work point recording has been stopped, and financial management systems have been improved or started to be established. Now, various places are continuing to carry out rectification in conjunction with summer harvest pre-distribution and production work. If we underestimate the arduous task of continuing to rectify and consolidate cooperatives in the future because of the great achievements of the cooperativization movement and the production movement and the effects of the past rectification work, it will be very harmful.
    We must continue to strengthen the socialist ideological education of members in the work of closely integrating production and rectification; organize all members of the province to seriously study the "Model Articles of Association of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives" to be adopted at this conference, so that it can become an important weapon for continuing to rectify our province's cooperatives, improve the socialist consciousness of members, and improve the management level of the society. Through this study and discussion, we will check and solve various existing problems, further improve the various systems of labor management and financial management; help cooperative cadres improve their working methods and overcome the style of coercion and command; implement democratic management and care for the personal interests of members; at the same time, we must also strengthen the role of grassroots political power organizations. As long as we continuously improve the quality of cooperatives, do a good job in production, and enable 90% of the cooperatives to increase production and 90% of the members to increase their income, we will further inspire the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in socialist construction. In addition, regarding the scale of the cooperatives, currently, 63% of the cooperatives in our province are one village per cooperative, and 26% of the cooperatives are one township per cooperative (most are small townships; we plan to merge townships after autumn, but not cooperatives). According to the current general management capacity of cooperative cadres and farming conditions, the scale of the cooperative is more suitable with one village per cooperative. We plan to generally maintain the status quo for several years without major changes.
    Fight Against Natural Disasters
    2. On the issue of fighting against natural disasters. In recent years, our experience in fighting against natural disasters in agricultural production is: as long as we are fully prepared with pesticides for insect pests that harm crops, and immediately organize the masses to prevent and control them as soon as insect pests are discovered, they will not spread into serious disasters. Our most serious enemy of agricultural production increase is floods. From 1949 to 1955, the average area of cultivated land affected by floods every year was more than 20 million mu. The average annual reduction in grain production was more than 1.37 billion jin. Now, the flood season has arrived, and various places in the province are busy with the river embankment reinforcement project and various preparations for flood control. In order to fundamentally overcome the harm of floods, in addition to continuing to carry out soil and water conservation in mountainous areas and doing a good job in flood prevention and drainage, we request the central government to continue to help us in terms of financial and technical strength, and basically complete the fundamental control projects of the Hutuo River and the Daqing River within 7 years from now.
    Revise Plans, Deepen Leadership
    3. On the issue of revising plans and deepening leadership. In August last year, the leading organs at all levels in our province formulated a plan to combine cooperativization and production. Later, according to the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967, a longer-term and comprehensive plan was formulated. Facts have proved that comprehensive planning not only greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in building socialism, promoted the upsurge of socialist transformation, and increased the enthusiasm for production, but also increased the foresight of the leading organs and improved the leadership level of the leading organs. Due to our lack of experience in comprehensive planning, we have focused on formulating or revising plans from top to bottom, and lack practical and repeated investigations and research. Therefore, our planning work has many shortcomings. In the second half of last year, it was mainly a right-leaning conservative bias, and after the realization of advanced cooperativization in January this year, it mainly existed with an impetuous and rash advance bias. There is a lack of unified and comprehensive understanding of the requirements for formulating plans to be both active and based on a fully reliable basis. For example, our province plans to increase the yield per mu of grain cultivated land this year from 179 jin last year to 250 jin, an increase of about 40% compared with last year. Such a rate of increase is not reliable enough. We plan to revise the originally planned total grain output of 25 billion jin to 22 billion jin, an increase of 3.8 billion jin compared with last year's total output, an increase of more than 20%, which is still higher than the national plan for this year by 10%. In our leadership in production, we have emphasized the production of major crops such as grain and cotton, which is correct, but we have not paid enough attention to other crops and sideline production. In addition, our province also has problems of demanding excessive haste and speed in the planning of cultural, educational, and health work. In order to correct this error, we are required to strengthen investigation and research, comprehensively understand the situation, study the situation, and revise the plan realistically. Further improve our leadership level in the struggle to overcome the current impetuous emotions and prevent conservatism.

    河北省的农业生产
    ——林铁代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长的报告。
    当我参加这次大会的时候，回想了上次大会闭幕以来，我国在社会主义革命高潮中突飞猛进的情景，使我非常兴奋和愉快。现在，我把河北省实现完全社会主义农业合作化以后，在农业生产上的新气象和存在的问题以及今后的意见，向大家作一汇报。
    入社农户占总农户99.35％
    根据今年三月底统计，全省共有高级农业生产合作社23，807个，初级社五十三个，入社农户8，313，961户，占总农户99.35％，绝大部分合作社的质量是好的。去冬今春，合作社运动和生产运动相互结合、相互推动，形成了农村中史无前例的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的高潮。
    农田水利建设
    大家知道，春旱秋涝是河北省长期以来的自然规律，因此，开展农田水利，加强水利建设成为我省当前农业增产的重要关键。去年冬天到今年五月底，我省完成各种水井72万多眼，相当过去六年打井总数的两倍。如果连同修理旧井，修建小水库和渠滩等共可扩大浇地面积1，600余万亩，半年的成绩增加了相当我省有史以来水浇地面积总和的一倍。在这里，我想向大家介绍一下邢台县大寨门村修建一个小水库的简单情况。邢台县大寨门村是太行山上一个117户的小山庄，去年冬季全村都参加了高级社。社员们讨论挖生产潜力，最好的办法是扩大水浇地面积，但是该村地势不适宜打井。后来，大家根据多年的经验，在两丈多岩石层的下面找到了泉水。就用了一万多工，用石头和水泥修建了一个暗水库。这个水库长20丈、宽1丈多，深3丈多，还有一条30丈长的暗水道。水库上面用石头旋了顶，顶上还可以种地。冬季施工时，雪小不停工，雪大时停了就作。大石头抬不上来他们采用了火烧击碎的办法。今春水库尚未竣工时，就浇了70多亩小麦，每亩可增产四、五十斤。如果整好土地，可浇200多亩，邻村还可得到利益。修建水库的同时，组织半劳力火熏了几万斤粗肥。其他农活也没有耽误农时。
    山区的水土保持、沟谷治理工作，从去年冬季到今年五月底，全省共计完成山沙荒造林172万多亩，谷坊29万多座，小水库396座、蓄水池两万多个、修建梯田117万多亩。平原上沟洫畦田工程完成了2，380万亩。
    施肥量增加一倍以上
    过去，我省一般地区，每亩土地全年施肥量约2，000斤粗肥。今年春播前，全省共积肥约8，500亿斤，春白地平均每亩施肥8，000多斤，如减少各种不切实的因素和按实际肥效估算，比去年全年施肥量至少增加一倍以上。
    在精耕细作、推广先进经验方面，去年普遍进行了秋耕，今春耙地两三遍。今年春播前，训练了农业社的技术人员20多万人。全省约有60％以上的农业社制定了当地主要作物的技术操作规程。
    合作社夏季空前丰收
    当前，全省农村正在紧张地进行着夏收、夏种、夏锄工作。许多合作社的麦田产量，经过实收实分都获得了空前的丰收。据调查统计，今年全省小麦总产量可达41亿斤，超过省定计划6.7％，超过国家计划15％，比去年增产17％；每亩平均产量，超过省计划4.5％，超过国家计划19.4％，比去年增加25％。藁城县21万亩麦田，平均每亩产320斤，社员们说这是“祖辈没听说过的好收成”。从各地农业社制定的夏收预分方案看来，绝大部分的社能够保证作到90％的社员增加收入；只有一小部分社由于联乡社或者联村社，实行统一预分，麦田多的村有的户收入减少了；或者由于麦田面积比往年减少了；或者由于副业搞的不好而减少了；也有个别的社因为扣留的多而减少了的。从总的情况看，我们遵照中共中央和毛主席关于正确处理社员个人与集体关系的指示，执行了少扣多分的原则，绝大部分的社能够作到90％的社员增加收入。因此，当讨论了夏收预分方案以后，大大地鼓舞了社员们的生产情绪，解除了一部分社员过去认为能够增产但不一定能够多分的顾虑。通县觅子店乡社的社员讨论了预分方案以后，劳动力出勤率由原来的70％提高到90％。
    成绩是很大的，也是主要的方面，另一方面也发生了不少的错误和缺点。在这里我想就下面几个问题谈一些意见。
    进一步巩固整顿农业合作社
    一、关于进一步巩固整顿农业合作社问题。今年二月，我省取得了全面社会主义改造决定性的胜利以后，各地在生产运动中，普遍地对农业社进行了整顿工作，特别是在贯彻执行中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的联合指示以后，取得了良好的效果。减少了非生产性的开支，制止了乱记工分的现象，健全了或者开始建立了财务管理制度。现在各地正在结合夏收预分和生产工作，继续进行整顿。如果因为合作化运动和生产运动取得的巨大成绩和过去进行整顿工作的效果而低估了今后继续整顿巩固合作社的艰巨任务，那是非常有害的。
    我们要在密切结合生产进行整社工作中，继续加强对社员的社会主义思想教育；组织全省社员认真学习这次大会即将通过的“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”，使它成为继续整顿我省合作社提高社员社会主义觉悟和社的管理水平的重要武器。通过这一学习讨论，检查并解决存在着的各种问题，进一步健全劳动管理和财务管理的各项制度；帮助社干部改进工作方法，克服强迫命令的作风；贯彻民主管理，关心社员的个人利益；同时还要加强基层政权组织的作用。只要不断地提高合作社的质量，搞好了生产，使90％的合作社增加生产，90％的社员增加了收入，那么，就会进一步启发广大农民的社会主义建设的积极性。另外，关于社的规模，目前，我省63％的社是一村一社，26％的社是一乡一社（大部分是小乡，我们计划秋后并乡，但不并社）。根据当前一般社干部的管理能力和耕作条件，社的规模以一村一社比较相宜。我们打算在若干年内，一般维持现状，不作大的变动。
    向自然灾害作斗争
    二、关于向自然灾害作斗争问题。几年来，我们在农业生产上对自然灾害斗争方面的经验是：对于危害农作物的虫害，只要在农药上有充分准备，一经发现虫害，立即组织群众防治，就不会蔓延成严重的灾害。我们的农业增产最严重的敌人是水灾。自1949年到1955年7年内平均每年遭受水灾的耕地面积2，000多万亩。每年平均减产粮食137，000多万斤。现在，汛期已到，全省各地正在紧张地进行河流的复堤加固工程和防汛的各种准备工作。为了从根本上战胜水灾的危害，我们除继续进行山区的水土保持并作好防洪、防涝的各项工作外，要求中央在财力和技术力量上继续帮助我们，从现在起在7年内基本上完成滹沱河和大清河的治本工程。
    修正规划，深入领导
    三、关于修正规划，深入领导的问题。去年八月，我省各级领导机关制订合作化和生产相结合的规划。后来根据1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案，制订了较长远的全面的规划。事实证明，全面规划不仅大大地鼓舞了广大农民建设社会主义的热情，推动了社会主义改造的高潮，提高了生产的积极性，而且增加了领导机关的预见性，提高了领导机关的领导水平。由于我们缺乏全面规划的经验，偏重了自上而下的制订或修改方案，缺乏切实的、反复的调查研究，因此，我们的规划工作存在着不少的毛病，去年下半年主要是右倾保守的偏向，今年一月实现高级合作化以后，主要是存在着急躁冒进的偏向。对制订规划要求既要积极又要放在充分可靠的基础上，缺乏统一全面的认识。例如，我省计划今年粮食耕地亩产要在去年179斤的基础上提高到250斤，约比去年增产40％，这样的增产速度是不够可靠的。我们打算将原订粮食总产量250亿斤，修改为220亿斤，比去年总产量增加38亿斤，提高20％多，仍高于今年国家计划的10％。我们在领导生产上，强调了粮食、棉花等主要农作物的生产，虽然这是对的，但是其他农作物和副业生产则注意不够。另外，我省在文化、教育、卫生各项工作规划上也都有要求过急过快的毛病。为了纠正这种错误，就要求我们加强调查研究，全面地了解情况、研究情况，实事求是地修正规划。在克服当前急躁情绪、防止保守主义的斗争中进一步提高我们的领导水平。
