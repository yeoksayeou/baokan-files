    Shandong Province Plants More Than Four Million Fruit Trees

    During this year's peach and plum blossom season, agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province planted more than four million fruit trees. Over 70% of the newly planted fruit trees are apple saplings such as "Qing Xiangjiao" (Green Banana), "Hong Xiangjiao" (Red Banana), "Guoguang," and "Hongyu" (Red Jade), transplanted from Yantai City, Fushan, Muping and other counties, as well as Liaoning Province. In addition, there are more than ten kinds of fruit trees, such as the famous Laiyang pear, Feicheng peach, and Dazeshan grape.

    Currently, the various fruit trees planted earlier in Jinan City and the southern Taishan and Yimeng mountainous areas have already grown tender leaves. The newly planted fruit trees on the Shandong Peninsula and along the Jiaoji Railway have also begun to sprout. Agricultural production cooperatives in various places planting fruit trees are stepping up management work such as fertilizing, watering, and controlling diseases and insect pests to protect the healthy growth of fruit tree seedlings.

    山东省栽种四百多万棵果树
    在今年桃李花开的季节里，山东省的农业生产合作社栽种了四百多万株果树。新栽植的果树中有70％以上是从烟台市、福山、牟平等县和辽宁省移来的“青香蕉”、“红香蕉”、“国光”、“红玉”等苹果树苗。此外，还有著名的莱阳梨、肥城桃、大泽山葡萄等十多种水果树。
    目前济南市和南部泰山、沂蒙山区早栽的各种果树，都已经长出嫩叶，山东半岛和胶济铁路两侧新栽的果树也已开始发芽。各地栽种果树的农业生产合作社，正在加紧进行施肥、浇水、除治病虫害等管理工作，以保护果树幼苗的健壮生长。
