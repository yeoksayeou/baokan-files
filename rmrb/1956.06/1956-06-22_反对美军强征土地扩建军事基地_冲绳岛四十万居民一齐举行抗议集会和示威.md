    Oppose US Military Forcibly Seizing Land to Expand Military Bases
    400,000 Residents of Okinawa Island Hold Protest Rallies and Demonstrations Together
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Four hundred thousand residents of Okinawa Island yesterday held protest rallies and demonstrations simultaneously in fifty-six cities, towns, and villages to oppose the United States forcibly seizing their land to expand military bases. The residents also passed a resolution expressing their determination to defend Okinawa Island's territorial rights.
    Sixteen social organizations in the Ryukyu Islands, including the Democratic Party, the Social Masses Party, the People's Party, labor unions, lawyers' organizations, youth federations, and women's federations, held their first liaison meeting on the 18th and passed a resolution firmly opposing the United States leasing land on Okinawa Island to establish military bases. The sixteen organizations also supported the stance of the Okinawa Island Legislature, the government, and urban and rural officials who expressed their willingness to resign if necessary to protest the United States turning Okinawa into a permanent base.
    The Japan Peace Committee issued a statement on the 19th, demanding that the US government immediately revoke the recommendation of the House Military Committee to return Okinawa Island to Japan; and demanded that the Japanese government formally negotiate with the United States to promote the realization of the above requirements. According to the recommendation of the US House Military Committee, the United States wants to turn Okinawa Island into a permanent atomic warfare base and increase the requisition of 12,000 acres of land. The Japan Peace Committee pointed out that this recommendation would not only cause the residents of Okinawa Island to lose their homeland, but also deprive them of their lives in the near future. The Treaty of San Francisco gave the United States administrative power over Okinawa Island, and the US-Japan "Security Treaty" gave the United States the right to maintain military bases in Japan.

    冲绳岛四十万居民一齐举行抗议集会和示威
    据新华社讯　四十万冲绳岛居民昨天在五十六个市、镇、村一齐举行抗议集会和示威游行，反对美国强征他们的土地来扩建军事基地。居民们并且通过决议，表示决心保卫冲绳岛的领土权。
    琉球群岛的民主党、社会大众党、人民党、工会、律师组织、青年联合会、妇女联合会等十六个社会团体，在十八日举行第一次联络会议，通过决议坚决反对美国租借冲绳岛的土地来建立军事基地。十六个团体并且支持冲绳岛立法院、政府和城乡负责官员表示在必要时以辞职来抗议美国把冲绳变成永久基地的态度。
    日本和平委员会在十九日发表声明，要求美国政府立即撤销众议院军事委员会的建议，把冲绳岛归还日本；并且要求日本政府同美国正式谈判，促使上述要求实现。据美国众议院军事委员会的建议，美国要把冲绳岛变成永久性原子战争基地，并且要增加征收一万二千英亩的土地。日本和平委员会指出，这个建议不仅要使冲绳岛居民失去故乡，并且不久还要剥夺他们的生命。旧金山和约使美国对冲绳岛握有行政权，美日“安全条约”给予了美国在日本保有军事基地的权利。
