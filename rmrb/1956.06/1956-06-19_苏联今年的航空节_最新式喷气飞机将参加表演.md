    据新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会中央委员会副主席库采瓦洛夫说，今年苏联将有许多最新式的喷气飞机参加苏联航空节的检阅。在六月二十四日那一天，参加检阅的重型喷气式飞机和喷气式歼击机，将分别作三架一列和五架一列的飞行表演。最近设计的一种试验性喷气式歼击机也要作飞行表演。
    苏联航空俱乐部的人员，将在这次检阅中作高级的集体航空表演。滑翔机个人飞行表演和“雅克—一八式”飞机的集体飞行表演，将是特别有意思的。检阅的最后，将是一批跳伞员从重型飞机上作集体跳伞表演。
    库采瓦洛夫还谈到了苏联航空运动员在过去一年取得的新成绩。他说，现在在国际航空联合会所登记的三十九项跳伞运动世界纪录中有三十五项是苏联跳伞运动员创造的。苏联滑翔机运动员取得五项世界纪录。苏联飞机模型制造者创造七项世界纪录。
