    I fully agree with and warmly support the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, as well as the speeches by the central leaders.
    Now, allow me to talk about the situation of our agricultural production cooperative's bumper wheat harvest this year.
    I am Xu Jingzhang, the director of the Douma Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province. Our agricultural production cooperative was established in the second half of 1953 and was transformed into an advanced agricultural production cooperative at the end of 1955 through the merger of 4 primary agricultural production cooperatives. Currently, the cooperative has 448 households, 2,709 people, a total of 1,160 male and female laborers, 8,543 mu of sloping and flat land, 270 mu of paddy fields, 226 draught animals, 69 carts, all kinds of old-fashioned farm tools, and also purchased some new-style farm tools. This year, the cooperative planted a total of 6,115 mu of wheat, which generally grew to nearly two meters high; the wheat ears were generally more than 3 cun long, some more than 4 cun long, almost as big as millet ears; the large ears had 108 grains of wheat, generally around 40 grains, more than ten grains higher than the average of twenty-four or five grains per ear last year; this year the wheat grains ripened particularly full, unmatched by any previous year. In the past, about 15,000 grains of wheat weighed about 1 jin, but this year only 13,500 grains are needed to weigh 1 jin. When I came to Beijing, the wheat in the cooperative had already been completely harvested, and the 207 mu of wheat that had already been threshed yielded a total of 104,468 jin, with an average yield of more than 504 jin per mu; it is predicted that the average yield of the cooperative's more than 6,000 mu of wheat this year can reach 424 jin, and the large plots of high-yield land can reach 750 jin per mu; the cooperative can harvest more than 2,594,000 jin of wheat this year, which is more than 700,000 jin more than last year, and more than 131 jin more per mu than last year, and more than 228 jin more than in 1949, which is 141 jin higher than the national fixed yield of 283 jin, greatly exceeding the 80% increase planned in the Five-Year Plan. With such a large bumper harvest this year, 91% of the members can increase their income, and most of the cooperative's 400-plus households will harvest one thousand four or five hundred jin more wheat than last year, with the most able to harvest two thousand four or five hundred jin more. After repeated calculations, after deducting public grain, public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and production costs, it is guaranteed that 72% of the income can be distributed to the members.
    This year's bumper wheat harvest has greatly boosted the morale and production enthusiasm of the members. In the days when the wheat was about to ripen, the members saw thousands of mu of wheat turn golden, growing so beautifully, and everyone, regardless of age or gender, was very happy. Zhang Daquan, an 86-year-old member, said excitedly: "I have been farming all my life and have never seen such beautiful wheat this year"; four or five days before the wheat was about to be brought to the threshing ground, the members, men and women, carried water day and night for three days and three nights to water more than 220 mu of threshing grounds, quickly overcoming the difficulties of dry weather and lack of moisture on the grounds that could not be smoothed properly. During the summer harvest, male and female members unanimously proposed to ensure that the wheat harvest, cotton weeding, and autumn planting would not be delayed. When I left, not only had all the wheat been brought to the threshing ground, but the cotton fields had been carefully weeded twice, the cotton seedlings had been set, and 1,400 mu of autumn seedlings had also been planted. The members not only proposed that the summer harvest this year must be quick to harvest, quick to thresh, and quick to store, achieving clean land and empty threshing grounds by the 15th, but also that the summer harvest distribution work should be done well and quickly. The members all said: "This year's bumper harvest is the happiness brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We are all very happy. We guarantee that this year we will first hand over the best wheat as public grain, and guarantee to sell 770,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, selling 230,000 jin more surplus grain. All the members also specially entrusted me to bring a bundle of wheat and a bag of wheat kernels to present to the Congress and Chairman Mao.
    This year, not only is the harvest of our agricultural production cooperative very good, but the Guanzhong area is generally the same, and even some cooperatives have better wheat than ours. However, our cooperative used a harvester to harvest 207 mu of wheat before the rain, and the remaining 5,000 mu of wheat were also harvested before the rain due to the good combination of labor, and were not damaged by the rain, but most of the wheat in Guanzhong has been damaged to a certain extent due to six days of overcast and rainy weather, reducing the harvest considerably. Therefore, it seems that the best way to harvest wheat in areas like Guanzhong when it ripens is to use machines. Although most of the Guanzhong area suffered from rain damage this year, a bumper harvest is still not a problem. Therefore, I believe that the grain production plan figures for 1956 proposed by Vice Premier Li in the national budget report can be realized.
    This year's bumper wheat harvest, in addition to timely rainfall, is inseparable from the agricultural production cooperative movement in the second half of last year, the encouragement of the "Forty Articles for Agricultural Development" of the CPC Central Committee to the cooperative members, the rational use of labor, the improvement of cultivation techniques, the deep plowing and moisture conservation of tractors, the large-scale and widespread application of fertilizer, and strip planting and dense planting. All of this should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Party, the State Council, and Chairman Mao.
    Our cooperative's work still has many shortcomings. We have not paid enough attention to the sideline production of members and the cooperative, as the Central Committee pointed out. For example, the cooperative raised more than 140 pigs last year, but only raised 12 this spring, and the members raised more than 500 privately last year, which has been reduced to more than 350 this year; the labor quotas are also not entirely reasonable, sometimes high and sometimes low, and the principle of more work, more pay, and payment according to labor has not been well implemented; other aspects such as the political and ideological work of the members, the full play of the members' enthusiasm, and contracting work and production have also not been done well enough. In the future, we must, in accordance with the provisions of the model charter of advanced agricultural production cooperatives adopted at this congress and the spirit of this congress, further strengthen the political and ideological work of the members, effectively improve the socialist consciousness of the members; actively improve labor organization; strengthen quota management; expand the area of multiple cropping, expand fertilizer sources, do a good job in water and soil conservation, build small-scale water conservancy projects, do a good job in agricultural production; vigorously develop agricultural and sideline production, and breed a large number of livestock, especially pigs, to increase the income of the members and increase the wealth of the country from all aspects, and advance victoriously towards the long-term goal of the Twelve-Year Plan for Agricultural Production!

### 把丰收的小麦献给大会和毛主席——许敬章代表的发言

    把丰收的小麦献给大会和毛主席
    ——许敬章代表的发言
    我完全同意和热烈拥护李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长的报告，以及中央各首长的发言。
    现在让我讲一下我们农业生产合作社今年小麦丰收的情况。
    我是陕西省兴平县豆马高级农业生产合作社的社主任。我们这个农业生产合作社是1953年下半年成立的，到1955年年底由4个初级农业生产合作社合并转为高级农业生产合作社。现在全社有448户，2，709人，男女劳动力共1，160人，坡、平地8，543亩，水田270亩，役畜226头，大车69辆，旧式农具大小俱全，新式农具也买了一些。今年全社共种小麦6，115亩，都普遍长的将近两公尺高；麦穗一般有3寸多长，有的4寸多，简直像谷穗那样大；大的穗子麦颗有108粒，一般都在40粒左右，比去年平均每穗二十四、五粒高出十多粒；今年麦粒熟的特别饱，过去任何一年都比不上，往年15，000多粒麦子约合1斤，今年13，500多粒就可以合到1斤。我来北京的时候，社里的麦子已经全部割完了，已经脱粒的207亩麦子共打104，468斤，平均每亩产量为504斤多；今年全社6，000多亩麦子预测平均产量可达424斤，大块田丰产每亩可达750斤；全社今年可收麦子2，594，000多斤，较去年可以多收70多万斤，每亩较去年可以多收131斤，较1949年可以多收228斤多，比国家定产283斤高出141斤，已经大大超过五年计划的80％多。像今年这样大的丰收，91％的社员可以增加收入，全社400多户的绝大部分户会比去年多收一千四、五百斤麦子，最多的可以多收到两千四、五百斤，经过反复计算除过公粮、公积金、公益金和生产费用等外，保证72％的收益可以分配给社员。
    今年麦子丰收的情况，大大鼓舞了社员们的情绪和生产积极性。在麦子快成熟的那几天，社员们看到几千亩麦子一片金黄，长的那样美，不论男女老少个个都非常高兴，86岁的张大全老社员很兴奋地说：“我做了一辈子庄稼也没有见过今年这样美的麦子”；麦子快上场的前四、五天，社员们男的女的三天三夜不分昼夜地担水泼场220多亩，很快地克服了天旱缺墒场不能光好的困难；在夏收中男女社员一致提出了保证要收麦、锄棉、种秋三不误，我来的时候不仅麦子全部上了场，而且棉田细锄了两遍，棉苗已经定好，1，400亩秋苗也全种上；社员们不仅提出今年夏收一定要快收、快碾、快藏，15日做到地净场光，而且要很好地迅速地作完夏收分配工作。社员都说：“今年的大丰收是共产党和毛主席给我们带来的幸福，我们个个人都非常高兴，我们保证今年首先把最好的麦子交纳公粮，保证把77万斤余粮卖给国家，要多卖余粮23万斤。全体社员还特别托我带来了一束麦子和一袋麦颗献给大会和毛主席。
    今年麦子不仅是我们农业生产合作社的收成非常好，关中地区普遍都是这样，甚至有的社比我们社的麦子还好。不过我社麦子雨前用收获机割了207亩，其余5，000亩麦子因劳动力组合的好也全在雨前赶收完了，没有受到雨害，但关中大部分的麦子因阴雨六日已经受到一定的损害减少收成不少。所以现在看像关中这样的地区麦子成熟时采用机器收割最好。今年关中地区大部分虽然受到雨害，但丰收还不成问题。所以我认为李副总理在国家预决算报告中提出1956年粮食生产计划数字是可以实现的。
    今年麦子丰收除天雨及时外，是与去年下半年的农业生产合作化运动，中共中央发展农业四十条纲要对于社员群众的鼓舞，劳动力的合理使用，耕作技术的改进，拖拉机的深耕保墒，大量普遍施肥、条播密植等分不开的。所有这一切都应该归功于党、国务院和毛主席的正确领导。
    我们社里的工作还有不少的缺点。对于社员和社的副业生产正像中央指出的没有很好地重视。例如去年社里养猪140多头，今春仅养12头，社员去年私养500多头，今年减少到350多头；劳动定额也不尽合理，忽高忽低，没有很好贯彻多劳多得、按劳付酬的原则；其他如对社员的政治思想工作、社员积极性的充分发挥、包工包产等也做得不够好。今后我们一定要本着这次大会所通过的高级农业生产合作社示范章程的规定和这次大会的精神，进一步加强社员的政治思想工作，有效地提高社员的社会主义觉悟；积极改进劳动组织；加强定额管理；扩大复种面积、扩大肥源、作好水土保持、兴修小型水利、搞好农业生产；大力开展农副业生产，大量繁殖牲畜，尤其是生猪，从各方面来增加社员收入和为国家增加财富，向着农业生产十二年规划的远景胜利前进！
