    The Inspection Work of People's Representatives
    Wu Kejian
      On May 18th last year, the 16th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided that representatives of the National People's Congress should take time to conduct inspections in their original electoral districts, their places of origin, or other regions. On May 8th this year, the 39th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress further decided that the items, locations, and objects of inspection by the people's representatives, as well as the cadres and masses to be approached, should be selected by the representatives themselves. This grants the people's representatives broad opportunities to fulfill their responsibilities in inspection work.
      Based on the above decision, the representatives of the National People's Congress conducted two inspections successively in May and November of last year. Now the third inspection, the spring inspection of 1956, has begun.
      Only the representatives of the National People's Congress participated in the first inspection, while the scope of the second inspection was expanded to include members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as members of the CPPCC and people's representatives of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. The number of participants increased each time. Regarding the inspection areas, during the first inspection, the representatives inspected a total of 23 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government; during the second inspection, they inspected a total of 27 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. The number of counties, cities, and autonomous prefectures inspected was even greater. In the first inspection, taking Hebei Province as an example, a total of nine special districts, eight cities, and seventeen counties were inspected; in the second inspection, according to incomplete statistics from thirteen provinces—Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu—a total of 203 counties, cities, and autonomous prefectures were inspected. Even more basic-level units were inspected. For example, in the first inspection, more than 600 units were inspected in Shanghai alone. In the second inspection, according to incomplete statistics from four provinces and cities—Hebei, Tianjin, Sichuan, and Hunan—a total of 161 agricultural production cooperatives, 68 industrial and mining enterprises, 26 schools, 18 hospitals, 12 handicraft production cooperatives, and 12 other basic-level units were inspected.
    Whether in the first or second inspection, the scope of inspection included: industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, mutual aid and cooperation, handicraft production, capital construction, unified purchase and sale, the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the transformation of backward villages, the ideological remolding of intellectuals, social security, labor reform, culture, education, health, science and technology, employee welfare, women's work, ethnic work, overseas Chinese affairs, religious affairs, CPPCC work, the resettlement of demobilized soldiers, the issue of military barracks, the treatment of district and township cadres, and even street and alley work, and so on.
    The duration of the first inspection was generally around fifteen days, often extending to more than twenty days; in the second inspection, most representatives extended it to a month or even longer.
    The representatives and members all chose their inspection areas and objects themselves. Many representatives and members chose three types of units: relatively good, relatively bad, and neither good nor bad, so that they could have a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and problems.
    The inspection methods generally involved listening to briefings from the higher-level units and the inspected units, holding symposiums, conducting individual interviews, making on-the-spot inspections, then summarizing and exchanging opinions with local leadership or the higher-level leadership of the inspected units, and making suggestions. Some of these opinions were submitted to relevant departments through the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    The inspection work has played a significant role. In the first inspection, the representatives wrote as many as 800,000 words of inspection reports and letters, not including the opinions and suggestions that the representatives made to the local governments during the inspection. Shanghai alone received more than 600 opinions from the representatives. In the second inspection, the people's representatives and CPPCC members wrote about 1.8 million words of inspection reports, with about 500,000 words of attachments. According to the classified statistics at the end of March this year, there were a total of 676 relatively important problems and opinions raised, including 151 related to agricultural cooperation and agricultural production, 73 related to the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, 48 related to the socialist transformation of handicrafts, 40 related to the unified purchase and sale of grain, 83 related to state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises, 15 related to transportation, 19 related to culture and education, 90 related to medicine and health, 7 related to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, 4 related to women's work, 12 related to ethnic and overseas Chinese affairs, 12 related to the aquatic products industry, 9 related to judicial work, and 13 related to street work, the transformation of backward villages, and the treatment of township cadres. Although it is impossible to describe all the specific problems that the representatives learned and discovered during the inspection here, it can be seen from these huge numbers that the representatives and members reflected many pressing problems in the lives of the masses and reflected many situations in various tasks during the inspection.
    Even if a task is done very well, shortcomings are unavoidable, just as a person with both ability and integrity inevitably has shortcomings. Moreover, for some things and some people, there may be many shortcomings. If no one discovers these shortcomings in time, the problems may pile up and remain unresolved for a long time. Through inspection work, it plays a supervisory and promotional role in promoting achievements, correcting mistakes, and overcoming the bureaucracy and subjectivism of leading organs being divorced from the masses and reality. The experience of the two inspections has proved that this method can strengthen the connection between the people's representatives and members and the people, and the connection between the national leading organs and the people. It not only facilitates the leading organs to understand the situation and improve their work, but also greatly encourages the broad masses of the people to exercise supervision over the national leading organs and leaders, and give play to the enthusiasm of the people in building socialism.
    The handling of the problems raised by the representatives during the inspection is carried out in accordance with the decision passed by the 20th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on August 6, 1955. That is, when the representatives inspect, they do not directly handle the problems, but hand them over to the local people's committees, people's courts, and people's procuratorates for handling. If necessary, the representatives can inform the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for handling. People's representatives of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government can inform the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government for handling. Although the people's representatives do not directly handle the problems, through inspection work, it can reflect the assisting role of the people's representatives to the state administrative organs, assist in the implementation of the Constitution, laws, and national policies, and promote the current work of the country.
    From the central to local levels, the opinions raised by the representatives and members during the inspection are generally valued. For example, Hunan, Shanghai and other provinces and cities specifically convened meetings of the provincial and municipal people's committees to listen to and discuss the opinions of the representatives and members; the Hebei Provincial People's Committee also made a resolution on conscientiously handling the various suggestions made by the representatives and members in the inspection work. Some areas and departments further inspected their own work based on the opinions raised by the representatives and members. Therefore, many problems have been studied and resolved by the time the inspection by the representatives and members ended. For example, in Minhou County, Fujian, due to the failure to do a good job in digging up rice roots the year before last, the income of farmers decreased. After the representatives and members raised this issue, the county people's committee immediately issued instructions and announcements, and the work of digging up rice roots in the county began.
    The inspection work is also of great benefit to the representatives and members themselves. "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." Things that had not been seen before are now seen; things that were not understood before are now better understood; problems that were previously examined and raised from a personal and partial perspective can now be examined and raised from a more comprehensive perspective. In this way, the representatives can often understand many new things, which makes it easier for them to have concrete facts as a basis when participating in the decision-making on major national affairs; this also facilitates the legislative work of the highest organ of power, because by concentrating the opinions and wisdom of the masses through the representatives, it is possible to reflect the requirements of objective reality more timely. Some representatives said: "Practical examples educated me," "The socialist consciousness of the people exceeds our expectations." Many representatives and members have personally seen that the face of our motherland, whether in cities or villages, is changing rapidly. Individual farmers have joined cooperatives one after another, private industrial and commercial enterprises have almost all become joint state-private enterprises, new factories, mines and railways are constantly being built, science and technology are making rapid progress, new people are growing, time and numbers are racing against us, the wheel of history is moving forward rapidly, and great victories have been achieved on all fronts of our motherland's construction. Many representatives and members have personally experienced in their inspection work that the people are the creators of this great cause, and the Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao are the organizers and leaders of this great victory.
    The superiority of the people's democratic system is also very clear here. The method of inspection by the people's representatives is a new creation. This method should be adhered to and implemented as a system for the state leading organs to contact the masses, connect with reality, and improve leadership work.

    人民代表的视察工作
    吴克坚
      去年五月十八日，全国人民代表大会常务委员会第十六次会议决定，全国人民代表大会代表应抽出时间，到原选举单位的地区、原籍或其他地区视察。今年五月八日，全国人民代表大会常务委员会第三十九次会议又决定人民代表视察的项目、地点、对象，以及接近的干部和群众，都由代表自行选定，这就赋予人民代表广泛的机会，来履行自己在视察工作中的责任。
      根据上述决定，全国人民代表大会代表先后在去年五月和十一月进行了两次视察。现在又开始第三次视察，即1956年的春季视察。
      第一次视察，只有全国人民代表大会代表参加，第二次视察范围扩大了，还有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员以及省、自治区、直辖市的政协委员和省、自治区、直辖市的人民代表。人数一次比一次增多。从视察地区来看，在第一次视察中，代表共视察了二十三个省、自治区、直辖市；第二次视察，共视察了二十七个省、自治区、直辖市。至于视察的县、市、自治州就更多，在第一次视察中，如以河北省为例，共视察了九个专区、八个市、十七个县；第二次视察，仅据河北、河南、江苏、浙江、山东、安徽、福建、江西、四川、广东、广西、陕西、甘肃十三个省不完全的统计，就视察了203个县、市、自治州。视察的基层单位就更多，如在第一次视察中，在上海市一地就视察了六百多个单位。第二次视察，据河北、天津、四川、湖南四个省、市不完全的统计，共视察了161个农业生产合作社，六十八个工矿企业，二十六所学校，十八所医院，十二个手工业生产合作社和十二个其他基层单位。
    无论是第一次或是第二次视察，视察的范围都包括了：工业、农业、畜牧业、渔业、互助合作、手工业生产、基本建设、统购统销、资本主义工商业改造、落后乡的改造、知识分子的思想改造、社会治安、劳动改造、文教卫生、科学技术、职工福利、妇女工作、民族工作、侨务工作、宗教事务工作、政协工作、复员军人的安置问题、驻军营房问题、区乡干部待遇问题乃至街道里弄工作等等。
    视察的时间，第一次一般在十五天左右，多到二十多天；第二次视察，大多数代表延长到一个月甚至一个月以上。
    代表们和委员们都是自行选择视察地区和视察对象。不少的代表和委员们都选择了比较好的、比较坏的和不好不坏的三种类型，这样就可以比较全面地了解情况和问题。
    视察的方式一般是听取被视察单位的上一级和视察单位的情况介绍，召开座谈会，个别访问，实地视察，然后总结一下，同当地或被视察单位的上一级领导机构交换意见，提出建议，其中有些意见是经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会向有关部门提出的。
    视察工作所起的作用是显著的。在第一次视察中，代表们所写的视察报告和信件，就有八十万字之多，这还不包括在视察期间代表向当地政府提出的意见和建议。上海市一地就收到了代表提出的意见六百多条。在第二次视察中，人民代表和政协委员写的视察报告，约计一百八十万字，附件约五十万字。按照今年三月底的分类统计，其中提出的比较重要的问题和意见共有676条，包括关于农业合作化和农业生产方面的151条，资本主义工商业社会主义改造方面的七十三条，手工业社会主义改造方面的四十八条，粮食统购统销方面的四十条，国营工商企业方面的八十三条，交通方面的十五条，文化教育方面的十九条，医药卫生方面的九十条，镇压反革命工作方面的七条，妇女工作方面的四条，民族和侨务工作方面的十二条，水产事业方面的十二条，司法工作方面的九条，街道工作、落后乡改造、乡干部待遇等方面的十三条。代表们在视察期间所了解和发现的具体问题，在这里虽然不可能一一叙述，但是从上面这些巨大数字中，已经可以看出代表和委员们在视察中反映了群众生活中的许多迫切问题，反映了各项工作中的许多情况。
    一件工作，尽管作得很好，缺点总是免不了的，这犹之一个德才兼备的人，难免有缺点一样。何况对某些事某些人来说，缺点可能是很多的。这些缺点，如果没有人去及时发现，问题可能堆成堆而长期得不到解决。通过视察工作，对于发扬成绩，纠正错误，对于克服领导机关脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义和主观主义，起了监督和推动的作用。两次视察工作的经验证明，通过这种方法，可以密切人民代表和委员同人民群众的联系，密切国家领导机关同人民群众的联系，既便于领导机关了解情况，改进工作，又可以大大鼓舞广大人民群众履行对国家领导机关和领导人员的监督，发挥人民群众建设社会主义的积极性。
    对代表在视察中所提出的问题的处理，是按照1955年8月6日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第二十次会议通过的决定办理的。这就是代表视察工作的时候，都不直接处理问题，而是分别交由当地人民委员会、人民法院、人民检察院处理。必要时，代表可以告诉全国人民代表大会常务委员会处理。省、自治区、直辖市人民代表可以告诉省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会处理。尽管人民代表不去直接处理问题，但通过视察工作可以体现出人民代表对国家行政机构的协助作用，协助宪法、法律和国家政策的实施，推动国家的当前工作。
    从中央到地方，一般都是重视代表和委员们在视察中所提出的意见的。例如湖南、上海等省、市专门召开了省市人民委员会会议，听取和讨论了代表和委员的意见；河北省人民委员会并且作出关于认真处理代表和委员视察工作中提出的各项建议的决议，有的地区和部门根据代表和委员提出的意见，进一步检查了自己的工作。因此，有不少问题，经过研究处理，在代表、委员视察结束的时候已经得到了解决。例如福建闽侯县由于前年挖毁稻根工作没有做好，农民收入减少。代表和委员们提出这一问题以后，该县人民委员会马上发布了指示和布告，全县挖毁稻根的工作就开展起来。
    视察工作对代表和委员们本身也有很大益处。“百闻不如一见”，从前没有看见过的东西，现在看见了；从前不了解的东西，现在较前了解了；从前是从个人和局部角度来考察问题和提出问题，现在比较能够用全面观点考察问题和提出问题了。这样，就使代表们可能经常了解许多新鲜事物，便于代表们在参与关于国家大事的决策的时候，有具体事实作为依据；这样也就便于最高权力机关的立法工作，因为通过代表集中群众的意见和智慧，就能够更及时地反映客观实际的要求。有的代表说：“实际事例教育了我”，“人民的社会主义觉悟超过了我们的想法”。许多代表和委员都亲眼看到，我们祖国的面貌，无论是城市或乡村，都在迅速改变。个体农民纷纷加入合作社，私营工商业差不多都公私合营了，新的工厂矿山和铁路不断建成，科学技术正在突飞猛进，新的人物正在成长，时间、数字正和我们赛跑，历史的车轮飞速向前推进，我们祖国建设的各个战线上，都取得了很大的胜利。许多代表和委员，在视察工作中亲身体验到人民群众是这一伟大事业的创造者，共产党、人民政府和毛主席是这一伟大胜利的组织者和领导者。
    人民民主制度的优越性，在这里也看得很清楚。人民代表视察工作的方法是一种新的创造。这种方法应该作为国家领导机关联系群众、联系实际、改进领导工作的一种制度，坚持执行。
