Make Science Popular and Meet the Needs of Agricultural Development
——Speech by Representative Cheng Shifan

I agree with and enthusiastically support all the reports made at the conference and am willing to strive for their realization. Representatives have already expressed many valuable opinions on the various reports. I would now like to offer some opinions on strengthening popular science work in Anhui Province for your consideration and correction.

As our country enters a historical period of upsurge in the socialist revolution, the Party Central Committee timely issued the great call to march towards science, which is of extremely great significance. In Anhui, whether in rural or urban areas, and in all aspects of production, rapid changes are taking place. This transformation will inevitably create a prerequisite for the further development of our national economy, and thus open up broad avenues for the development and practical application of science.

The promulgation of the 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) is a great and wise measure by the Central Committee and a programmatic document for our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. From a scientific point of view alone, all 40 articles include rich and complex scientific content. Taking the grain production target as an example, the total grain output in the country should be doubled and a half within 12 years compared to the current total output. This increase is rare in human history. To achieve such an index, we must redouble our efforts. We cannot wait for the gifts of nature; we must strive for it from nature. Thus, we are faced with extremely glorious and arduous tasks in scientific research and popularization, namely, how to make science applicable to the needs of productivity development and technological development.

Anhui is a province with agriculture as its main focus. In order to popularize science and vigorously cooperate with the needs of agricultural cooperativization, under the leadership and attention of the Communist Party and people's committees at all levels in our province, 50 of the province's 73 cities and counties have established branches as of now. The remaining 23 city and county branches will all be established by the end of July. This has laid the foundation for comprehensively carrying out scientific propaganda work. In our work, we have firmly grasped the principle of not only doing a good job in scientific research, but also vigorously carrying out popular science work. In particular, the promotion of advanced technologies and advanced experiences in agricultural production has been carried out using films, slides, science kits, reports, and other forms that are easy for farmers to understand and have a great educational effect. In the arrangement of science and technology workers for science lectures or writing articles, generally no more than twice a year per person, they do not feel burdened and can enthusiastically participate in this work.

However, as pointed out in the speech by President Guo Moruo, the science expenditure budget for 1956 has increased to 227.17% compared to the previous year for the central government. This is sufficient to show the state's emphasis on scientific research. In the 1956 national budget, the budgeted expenditure amount for the "science expenditure" project in Anhui Province is 115,000 yuan, which further demonstrates the initiative of the local area. However, compared with the new situation of Anhui's current development, the province has established a scientific research institute and plans to carry out scientific research work on a larger scale. The budgeted expenditure amount for this project will be several times greater than the above figure; in addition, the provincial popular science association branch and branch business expenses and publicity equipment purchase costs, in reducing expenditure figures, require approximately 282,500 yuan (provincial branch business expenses of 60,000 yuan, publicity equipment purchase costs of 40,000 yuan; each branch is calculated at an average of 2,500 yuan, with small counties at 1,000 yuan and large counties at 4,000 yuan). I suggest that the central government consider both figures and request that the business expenses of the popular science association branch and branches be included in the national budget expenditure. This will more effectively correct the chaotic phenomenon that has already occurred in our province's established branches, where the development of work is greatly affected due to the inability to solve business expenses.

Finally, I express my enthusiastic response to the Party's call, humbly learn from scientists, and follow scientific workers in the great march towards science, to strengthen unity and strive for socialist construction.

    使科学普及并配合农业发展的需要
    ——程士范代表的发言
    我同意并热烈拥护大会所作的各项报告，并愿为其实现而奋斗。对各项报告，代表们已发表了很多宝贵的意见，我现仅就加强安徽省科普工作，发表一点意见，请各位代表指正。
    当我们国家进入社会主义革命高潮的历史时期，党中央适时地发出了向科学进军的伟大号召，这是具有极其重大意义的。就我们安徽来说，无论在农村和城市，在生产上的各方面，都在发生着急剧的变化。这一变革，它将必然为我国国民经济的进一步发展创造前提，因而，也就为科学的发展和实际应用，开辟了广阔的道路。
    1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）的公布，是中央伟大的英明措施，是我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的纲领性文件，我们单从科学的角度来看，40条都包括了丰富而复杂的科学内容。仅以粮食生产指标，在12年内，全国粮食总产量要达到目前总产量的二倍半，这个增产数字，在人类史上也是少有的，要达如此指数，我们必须加倍努力，我们不能等待自然的恩赐，我们要向大自然争取，这样，也就在科学研究和普及面前，提出了极其光荣而艰巨的任务，即如何使科学适用于生产力的发展、技术发展的需要。
    安徽是农业居多的省区，为使科学普及并大力配合农业合作化的需要，我省在共产党和各级人民委员会的领导重视下，全省73个市、县中，截至目前止，已有50个市、县建立支会，其余23个市、县支会，将在七月底全部成立。使全面开展科学宣传工作奠定了基础。在工作中，我们是紧紧掌握了既做好科学研究，同时，又要大力开展科学普及工作，特别对农业生产的先进技术，先进经验的推广，是采取了农民易懂，教育意义收效大的电影、幻灯片、科学箱、报告会等形式，进行宣传工作的。对科技工作者在科学讲座或写稿的安排上，一般每人每年不过两次，并不感到负担重，并能热心该项工作。
    但在郭沫若院长的发言中指出：1956年度科学支出预算，就中央来说，较前增加到227.17％，这些足以说明，国家对于科学研究的重视。并在1956年国家预算书内，对安徽省“科学支出”项目的预算支出金额为115，000元，就进一步发挥了地方的积极性。但同安徽目前发展的新情况比较，省已成立科学研究所，拟较大规模的进行科学研究工作，此项预算支出金额将比上述数字大若干倍；另有省科普协会分会、支会业务经费和宣传器材购置费等，在减缩支出的数字上，约需282，500元（省分会业务费6万元，宣传器材购置费4万元；各支会按小县1，000元、大县4，000元，平均为2，500元计算）。两项数字建议中央考虑，并请求把科普协会分、支会业务经费列入国家预算支出。以较有效的纠正我省已经成立的支会，因业务经费无法解决，而大大影响了工作开展的混乱现象再有发生。
    最后，我表示热烈的响应党的号召，虚心向科学家学习，并随同科学工作者，向科学大进军，以加强团结，为建设社会主义而奋斗。
