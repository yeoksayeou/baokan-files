    Ultrasound - The Invisible Sound
    Researcher at the Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ying Chongfu

    The sound we hear is a mechanical vibration transmitted through the air. But not all mechanical vibrations are audible. Vibration has several characteristics, one of which is its frequency, which is the number of back-and-forth vibrations per second. If the frequency of vibration is approximately between sixteen and twenty thousand times per second, it can generally be heard as sound; but if the frequency of vibration exceeds this range, people generally cannot hear any sound. Mechanical vibrations with a frequency of approximately twenty thousand times per second or more are called ultrasound. Some people call ultrasound supersonics, supersonic waves, or ultrasonic waves. Because the character "音" (yin) contains the meaning of pleasant sound, and because the character "声" (sheng) itself contains the meaning of wave, the terms supersonics, etc., do not seem appropriate.

    Although the study of acoustics has a long history, the study of ultrasonics has only begun in recent decades. When scientists moved from audible sound to ultrasound, they gradually discovered that this new field was an exceptionally important one. It turned out that higher-frequency ultrasound has its own unique characteristics compared to audible sound: it possesses greater mechanical energy and can propagate in one direction.

    Let's first look at the latter characteristic. We know that the directionality of audible sound is very small. When a person speaks, his voice can be heard all around him. However, higher-frequency ultrasound mainly propagates in one direction and does not spread in all directions. This directionality can obviously be put to good use. Using ultrasound to detect schools of fish in the ocean is one example. Here, not only is the directionality of ultrasound utilized, but also a characteristic of sound in general, which is that sound can propagate very far in water. This is something that radio waves or light waves of any frequency cannot do. The technology used to detect schools of fish can also be used to detect other objects in the water and determine their location. The importance of this technology is obvious. Detecting submarines underwater can utilize this technology. If this technology is used to measure vertically downwards from the sea surface, the depth of the sea can be measured; if it is measured horizontally along the sea surface, obstacles in front of the ship, such as ships, icebergs, etc., can also be detected. In nature, bats have long used ultrasound to detect obstacles, ensuring the safety of high-speed flight in the dark. The same technology can also be applied to solids. Ultrasound has been used on a large scale to detect defects in metals, such as cracks and voids. As in water, ultrasound's penetrating ability in metals is usually stronger than other types of waves. Therefore, in some cases, ultrasound is more suitable for flaw detection than commonly used X-rays or r-rays. When the object being inspected can only be accessed from one side, ultrasound is the only one of these three types of waves that can be used for flaw detection.

    Ultrasound has the characteristic of high energy. This characteristic has been utilized and has been very fruitful. In industry, ultrasound is used to purify the surfaces of machine parts. When there is oil on the surface of a machine part, the part can be placed in a liquid, and then ultrasound is emitted into the liquid, and the oil layer on the surface of the machine part will be quickly destroyed. This can reduce a lot of cleaning time, especially when the machine parts are very small and have many small holes, making it almost impossible to scrub them using ordinary methods. Ultrasound is also used in industry to "cut" or "drill" hard and brittle materials (including semiconductor materials such as germanium and silicon, and jewels in watches). It is inconvenient and uneconomical to process these hard and brittle materials with ordinary tools. The most prominent advantage of ultrasonic cutting and drilling is that it can cut or drill complex-shaped surfaces or holes in one go.

    In addition to the examples mentioned in the previous two sections, ultrasound is also used in many other areas. Ultrasound is used to assist in welding aluminum. The surface of aluminum often has a layer of oxide film, and the solder is not easy to wet the parts that need to be welded; ultrasound can break this film. Ultrasound is also used to measure water flow velocity and liquid viscosity, etc. In the chemical industry, ultrasound can be used to manufacture various latexes; recover valuable chemical raw materials from waste gas; pulverize dyes, thereby accelerating the coloring process of artificial fibers; detect the progress of certain chemical processes; accelerate certain chemical reactions, etc. In medicine, ultrasound can be used to evenly heat certain body organs; see through certain organs that cannot be analyzed by X-rays; drill teeth; destroy certain bacteria and reduce the activity of some other bacteria, thus facilitating disinfection and vaccine preparation. In agriculture, ultrasound has been proven to promote the growth of yeast and the growth of treated seeds. In metallurgy, ultrasound has also been proven to reduce the grain size of metals, remove gas from metals, and improve the quality of electroplating. In electronic circuits, ultrasonic delay lines have a wide range of applications.

    In basic research, ultrasound is also an extremely effective tool. Ultrasound attenuates as it propagates in gases, liquids, or solids, and in some cases, it also changes its propagation velocity. Conclusions about the structure of the medium itself can be deduced from the study of these phenomena. For example, the attenuation of ultrasound in metals changes with temperature or other conditions. It is generally believed that these phenomena are related to superconducting electrons and defects in the metal structure, so this research can help understand the properties of the latter two.

    It should be noted that the application of ultrasound in various fields is still relatively new. Some of the existing application methods are already mature and can be used on a large scale in productive scale, such as drilling, cutting, cleaning, and latex manufacturing methods. However, some are still in the laboratory testing stage, and some problems remain to be solved. Therefore, we cannot assume that all known application methods can currently meet all stringent requirements. We still need to do a lot of work in scientific research and solve many difficulties. Even for those application methods with significant results, there is still a need to seek greater improvements. It is especially worth noting that because the application of ultrasound is a relatively new thing, some possible application methods have inevitably not been discovered. Expanding the application range of ultrasound and seeking new application methods and new application directions is an extremely important task.

    In China, the application of ultrasound has begun to attract attention. Ultrasonic flaw detection technology has been used in many fields, ultrasonic cleaning equipment has been established; methods for using ultrasound to detect schools of fish are also being verified. However, many other applicable methods have not been cited, and the scientific research work on ultrasound has not been well developed. In order to utilize the strengths of all parties to build a socialist society, we should further strive to study the basic characteristics of ultrasound, improve the technology of ultrasound application, and expand its application range.

    超声——听不见的声音
    中国科学院应用物理研究所研究员　应崇福
    我们听到的声音是空气中传来的机械振动。但并不是所有的机械振动都是可以听到的。振动有它的若干特性，其中之一是振动的频率，也就是每秒钟内来回振动的次数。如果振动的频率约在每秒十六次到二万次之间，一般人就可以听得到是声音；但是如果振动的频率超出这范围，一般人便听不到什么声音了。频率大约每秒在二万次以上的机械振动叫做超声。有人把超声叫作超音，超音波，或者超声波。因为音字含有悦耳的声的意思，又因为声字本含有波的意思，超音等名辞似乎不妥。
    虽然声学的研究有长远的历史，超声学的研究却是最近几十年才开始的。当科学工作者从可听声推进到超声的时候，他们逐渐发现这新的领域是个异常重要的领域。原来频率较高的超声，比起可听声来，有它的特出点，便是它具有大的机械能量和它能朝一个方向传播。
    让我们先看看后一个特点吧。我们知道，可听声的方向性是很小的。当一个人说话的时候，在他的四周都能听到他的声音。但是频率较高的超声却主要地沿着一个方向传播，而不向各方散开。这种方向性显然是可以好好地加以利用的。用超声来探查海洋中的鱼群，是一个例子。在这里，不仅利用了超声的方向性，而且利用了一般声的一项特性，就是声在水中能够传播很远的这种特性。这是任何频率的无线电波或光波都办不到的。用来探查鱼群的技术，同样可以用来探查水中的其他物体，并且确定它的位置。这个技术的重要性是很明显的。探查水底的潜水艇就可以应用这种技术。如果运用这种技术从海面沿着竖直方向朝下测量，就可以量出海的深度；如果在海面沿着水平方向测量，还可以测出船前的障碍物，如船只、冰山等等。在自然界中，蝙蝠早已利用超声探测障碍物，以保障在黑暗中高速飞行的安全。同样的技术还能应用到固体里来。超声已经被大规模地使用来探查金属中的缺陷，像裂缝空洞等。如同在水里一样，在金属里，超声穿透的能力通常比其他种类的波强。因此在某些情形下，超声比常用的爱克斯光或r射线更适宜作探伤用。当检查的对象只有一个面能接触到的时候，超声是这三种波动中唯一可用的探伤工具。
    超声具有大能量的特点。这种特点已经被利用了，而且很有成果。在工业上，超声被用来净化机件的表面。机件表面有油污的时候，可以把机件放在液体里面，再发射超声到液体里面，机件表面的油污层很快地就会被破坏。这可以减少许多清洗时间，尤其在机件很巧小，又钻有许多小孔，用普通办法几乎不可能刷洗的时候。超声在工业上又被用来“切”或“钻”硬脆的物质（包括如锗、矽等半导体材料和钟表中的宝石）。这种硬脆的物质用一般工具来加工，一来不便利，二来不经济。超声切钻最特出的优点是一次便能切出或钻出复杂形状的面或孔来。
    除掉上两节所举的一些例子以外，超声还被用在其他许多方面。超声被用来协助焊接铝。铝表面经常有层氧化薄膜，焊锡不易润湿需要焊接的部分；用超声可以击破这层膜。超声又被用来测定水流速度和液体的粘滞性等。在化工方面，超声可以用来制造各种乳胶；从废气中收回贵重的化学原料；粉碎染料，随着加速人造纤维的着色过程；探测若干化学过程的进行；加速若干化学反应等等。在医药方面，超声可以用来对某些身体机构均匀加热；透视某些为爱克斯光所不能分析的器官；钻牙齿；破坏某些细菌并且消减其他一些细菌的活动能力，因此便利消毒及制备疫苗。在农业方面，超声被验证能促进酵母的生长和经过处理的种子的生长。在冶金方面，超声也被验证能减小金属的晶粒，减除金属的含气，和改进电镀的质量等。在电子线路方面，超声延迟线有很广的应用。
    在基本的研究中，超声也是极有效的工具。超声在气体、液体或固体中传播的时候会衰减，在某些情形下同时会改变它的传播速率。由这些现象的探讨可以推得若干关于媒质本身结构的结论。譬如超声在金属中的衰减随温度或其他条件而变更，一般相信这些现象同超导电子和金属结构的缺陷有关，因此这种研究可以帮助了解后两者的性质。
    应该注意，超声在各方面的应用还是比较新鲜的事情。已有的应用方法，有的已经成熟，能够在生产性的规模上大量使用，像钻切、清洗、制造乳胶等方法。有的却还在实验室试验阶段，有些问题还待解决。因此我们不能以为所有已经知道的应用方法目前都已经可以满足各种严格的要求，我们还需要在科学研究上作许多工作，解决许多困难。就是对那些成效显著的应用方法，也还需要寻求更大的改进。尤其值得注意的，因为超声的应用是件较新的事情，不可避免地有些可能应用的方法还没有被发现。扩大超声的应用范围，寻求新的应用方法、新的应用方向，是件极重要的工作。
    在国内，超声的应用已经开始受人注意。超声探伤的技术已经在多方面使用，超声清洗的设备已有设立；超声探查鱼群的办法也正在验证。但是许多其他可以应用的方法还没有被引用，超声的科学研究工作也还没有很好的展开。为要利用各方面的力量来建设社会主义社会，我们应当进一步努力研究超声的基本特性，改进超声应用的技术，并且推广它的应用范围。
