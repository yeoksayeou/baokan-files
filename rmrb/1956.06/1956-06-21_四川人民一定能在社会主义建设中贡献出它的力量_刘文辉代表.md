The People of Sichuan Will Surely Contribute Their Strength to Socialist Construction
—Representative Liu Wenhui

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports convincingly reflect the glorious achievements of our country's socialist construction and demonstrate the outstanding leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. From the facts I have personally experienced, they also prove the correctness of these reports. Now, I will report to you, the representatives, what I have seen and thought during this inspection, and I welcome your criticism and correction.

During this visit, we inspected more than 20 industries and units in the urban and suburban areas of Chengdu, Sichuan, including industrial construction, agricultural cooperatives, joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises, and handicraft cooperatives. Although the time for the inspection was not long, the responsible comrades of each unit gave us detailed, truthful, and concise introductions before the inspection, which enabled us to focus on visiting the masses and understanding the problems.

The Consciousness and Enthusiasm of the Masses Have Been Unprecedentedly Enhanced

No matter which industry or unit I looked at, what impressed me most was the unprecedentedly enhanced consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses. The masses not only ideologically support the Party and the government and want to take the socialist road, but also actively take action to realize the beautiful socialist vision as soon as possible. Take agriculture as an example: After cooperativization, production will definitely increase, and farmers' incomes will definitely increase (over 90% of the farmers in the cooperatives we inspected have increased their incomes). The farmers all realize that socialism is not only an ideal but is also being built in reality. Therefore, their enthusiasm and excitement are not difficult to understand. For example, agricultural women in the suburbs of Chengdu have rarely worked in the fields in the past, but after cooperativization, they generally go to the fields to cultivate, and some have already mastered the technique of "transplanting rice seedlings along lines." They receive equal pay for equal work as men, not only without discrimination but also with appropriate care. Farmers not only use their hands but also their brains. In order to increase production, they have formulated various practical and feasible specific plans and come up with various methods to realize these plans. Taking manure accumulation as an example, they do not simply wait for fertilizer from fertilizer plants or just accumulate manure in general, and they also try to adopt feasible local methods, such as digging peat, collecting green manure, and using jar manure, etc. The same is true in other departments. After the Chengdu Thermal Power Plant submitted this year's plan to the masses for discussion, it was not only practical and feasible but also increased the original targets considerably. The original plan was to increase the total output value by 78% compared with 1955, but after discussion, it was greatly increased to 98.6%. The electricity output was increased from 80.65% to 95%. The original plan was to reduce costs by 3.9%, but after discussion, it was changed to 10.45%. The new plan was overfulfilled in both the first quarter and April of this year. The masses of the plant put forward 546 rationalization proposals, of which 213 have been adopted and 107 have been implemented. Another example is the Chengdu Food Company's breeding farm, which not only improved its work but also was able to use its brains when promoting the advanced breeding experience of Northeast China and Changsha, making the advanced experience more suitable for the specific local conditions: changing the three good things for feeding (eat well, drink well, sleep well) to four good things (plus select well); changing the three fixed things (fixed personnel, fixed quotas, fixed quantities) to four fixed things (plus fixed time). Other handicraft cooperatives and joint state-private industries have improved production methods and production tools, and joint state-private commercial enterprises have created the card sales method and the key point pressure code method (preliminary calculations show that the implementation of this method in the Chengdu cotton cloth industry can save 60,000 hours per year), which has significantly increased both production and sales. These not only show how high the enthusiasm of the masses is, but also prove once again that the wisdom of the masses is infinite.

However, with the rapid development of the new situation, some of our work has not kept up with the requirements of the situation. Here, based on what I have seen and heard during the inspection, I would like to raise two issues for the attention of relevant parties.

      Strengthen Planning

The first is the issue of strengthening planning: Under the leadership of the Party and the government, our socialist transformation and construction are being carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. After Chairman Mao put forward the call for "overall planning," all departments and units paid more attention to the issue of planning, not only making specific plans but also often anticipating the problems that would arise and including solutions in the plans. Even so, we still feel that the coordination in planning is not enough. For example, the newly built Chengdu Waterworks is planned to be three times larger than the original waterworks, but before it is put into production, it is felt that it is one times different from the planned industrial needs. The pipes, fittings, etc. that the plant ordered from Tianjin and Shanghai were originally scheduled to be delivered in February, but as a result, Tianjin and Shanghai accepted other tasks and could not deliver them on time, which affected the construction of the plant. Another example is the Chengdu Thermal Power Plant, which was originally designed according to a 6,000-volt voltage, but later the Electric Power Bureau changed 6,000 volts to 10,000 volts, so the 6,000-volt standard design had to be redone. The same is true for handicraft cooperatives. An ironware production cooperative not only did not receive raw material supply from the state-owned hardware company, but also the company did not strictly fulfill the processing contract, which made the production of the cooperative very abnormal. Other plans, such as the fertilizer supply plan for agriculture, the commodity supply plan for industry and commerce, and the wage adjustment plan, should be formulated and resolved promptly.

      Strengthen Learning

The second is the issue of strengthening learning: Similarly, this issue has always been valued and has already achieved results. For example, the smooth completion of the transformation of private industry and commerce cannot be said to be unrelated to learning. However, the situation has changed, and people's demands for learning are even more urgent. After the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts and the transformation of private industry and commerce, it is generally recognized that the capitalist road is not only unworkable but also irreversible. Industrialists and businessmen who want to take the socialist road must not only thoroughly eliminate the corrupt style of capitalist management but also establish a positive socialist ideology on every specific issue, improve management in accordance with socialist principles, and learn the skills to build socialism, and contribute their strength to the cause of building socialism. Therefore, they urgently demand learning to transform their thinking and master technology. Handicraft workers after cooperativization and industrialists and businessmen after joint operation are now learning, but in general, they reflect that the transformation of people lags behind the transformation of enterprises. The problems existing in learning are: time cannot be guaranteed, some learn a lot, even repeatedly, while others do not have time to learn; the level of education is uneven, some do not understand, some think it is too shallow, and learning is not interesting. These all need to be further improved and strengthened. In rural areas, a high tide of cultural learning has arrived, and the work of eliminating illiteracy has been greatly expanded, but not every cooperative has done it well enough. Some cooperatives have not done well due to teacher problems and equipment problems, and cannot meet the needs of the farmers. Therefore, it is necessary to include learning in the overall plan of the cooperative, so that we can learn more at ordinary times, learn less when we are less busy, and stop learning when we are very busy. Only in this way can we meet the needs of the farmers and lay a solid foundation for the increasingly developed improvements in technology, financial management, and labor organization.

× × ×

Each inspection has given me a profound and specific education. Especially this time, I saw the increase in production in various departments and the increase in the income of workers, and I deeply realized the effect of the liberation of productive forces and the infinite wisdom and creativity of the working people. I also learned more about the reliability of our Five-Year Plan. This has further made us realize the correctness of Chairman Mao's instruction to "take the mass line." Because of what I have personally witnessed, I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and the People's Government, Sichuan will be able to contribute its due strength to the cause of building socialism, just like other regions.

    四川人民一定能在社会主义建设中贡献出它的力量
    ——刘文辉代表主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长的报告。这些报告，令人信服的反映了我国社会主义建设的辉煌成就，说明了中国共产党和毛主席的卓越领导。从我亲身体验到的事实来看，也证明了以上这些报告的正确性。现在，我把此次视察中所看到的、想到的，向各位代表汇报一下，请批评指正。
    我们这次在四川成都市的市区和郊区，视察了工业建设、农业合作社、公私合营工商业、手工业合作社等部门的20多个行业和单位。视察的时间虽然不多，但由于视察前各单位负责同志，都给我们作了详细、真实、扼要的介绍，使我们在视察中能有重点的访问群众、了解问题。群众的觉悟和积极性空前提高
    无论看哪个行业或单位，特别使我深刻感到的，是群众的觉悟和积极性的空前提高。群众不但在思想上拥护党和政府，要走社会主义的路，而且积极的行动起来，要使社会主义的美景，早日实现。拿农业来说，合作化后，生产肯定的可以增加，农民的收入也肯定的要加多（我们视察的合作社，90％以上的农户增加了收入），农民们都认识到，社会主义，不但是理想中的，而且是现实中已在建设的。因此，他们的积极和兴奋，是不难理解的。例如：成都郊区的农业妇女，历来是少有下田的，合作化后，普遍下田耕作，而且有的已经掌握“栽秧开线”的技术。她们和男人一样，同工同酬，不但不受歧视，而且得到适当的照顾。农民们不但用手，还用脑，为了增产，订出各种切实可行的具体计划，想出各种办法来实现这个计划。以积肥而论，他们就不是单等肥料厂的肥料，或只一般的积肥，并且尽量采用当地可行的办法，如挖泥炭、打青蒿、罐罐肥等。其他各部门也一样，成都火电厂今年的计划交群众讨论后，不特切实可行，而且较原定指标增大不少。生产总值原定比1955年增加78％，讨论后改大为98.6％，电力由80.65％增大为95％；成本原定降低3.9％，讨论后改为10.45％。新计划在今年第一季度和四月份都超额完成。该厂群众提出合理化建议546件，现采用213件，实现了107件。又如成都市食品公司饲养场，不但工作改进，而且在推广东北和长沙的先进饲养经验时，能开动脑筋，使先进经验更适合于当地的具体情况：把饲养的三好（吃好、饮好、睡好），改为四好（加挑选好）；改三定（定员、定额、定量）为四定（加定时）。其他手工业合作社和公私合营的工业方面改进了生产方法和生产工具，公私合营的商业方面创造了卡片售货法，重点压码法（初步计算，此法在成都棉布业中实行，全年可节省6万小时）等等，使得生产量和销售量都有显著的增加。这些不但说明群众的积极性是如何高涨，而且又一次证明群众的智慧是无穷的。
    但是，随着新形势的飞快发展，我们还有一些工作赶不上形势的要求，这里，根据视察的见闻，提出两个问题来请求有关方面的注意。
      加强计划性
    首先是加强计划性问题：在党和政府的领导下，我们的社会主义改造和建设，是有计划有步骤的进行的，在毛主席提出“全面规划”的号召后，各部门、各单位更加注意计划这个问题，不但作了具体的计划，而且常常预见到将要产生的问题，在计划中列入解决的方法。即使这样，我们还是觉得，在计划方面配合仍有不够。例如：成都新建自来水厂，计划比原有水厂大三倍，但还未投入生产，就感到与计划中的工业方面需要量相差一倍。该厂向天津、上海订购的管道、配件等，原来二月交货，结果天津、上海方面接受了其他任务，不能按期交货，影响该厂的建设。又如：成都火电厂原按6，000伏电压设计，后电业局改6 ，000伏为1万伏，于是6，000 伏标准的设计，都得重新改作。手工业合作社方面也如此，一个铁器生产合作社，不但没有得到国营五金公司的原料供应，而且公司不严格履行加工合同，使该社生产很不正常。其他如农业的肥料供应计划，工商业方面的商品供应计划，工资调整的计划，都应即时订出、迅速解决。
      加强学习
    其次是加强学习问题：同样，这问题是一直被重视而且已经取得成绩的。例如对私营工商业改造的顺利完成，不能不说与学习有关。但是，形势变化了，人们学习的要求更加迫切了。农业、手工业合作化、私营工商业改造后，普遍认识到资本主义的道路不但走不通，而且一去不复返了。工商业者要走社会主义的道路，不但要彻底破除资本主义经营管理的腐朽作风，并且要在每一个具体问题上，树立社会主义的正面思想，按照社会主义的原则改善经营管理，学会建设社会主义的本领，在建设社会主义的事业中，贡献出自己的力量，所以他们迫切要求学习以改造思想、掌握技术。合作化后的手工业者和合营后的工商业者，现在虽然都有学习，但一般反映，对人的改造落后于企业的改造。而学习中存在的问题是：时间不能保证，有的学习得多，甚至重复学习，有的则没有时间学；文化程度不齐，有的学不懂，有的嫌太浅，学习无兴趣。这些都需要进一步改进和加强。农村中，学习文化高潮已经到来，扫盲工作大大展开，但不是每个社都作得很够，有的社因为师资问题，设备问题，开展得不好，不能满足农民的要求。因此，有必要在合作社的整个计划中，把学习一项列进去，作到平时多学，小忙少学，大忙放学，这样，才能满足农民的要求，才能对日益发展的改进技术、搞好财务管理以及组织劳动等方面打下坚固的基础。
                ×　×　×
    每次视察，都使我受到深刻而具体的教育。特别这一次，我看到各部门生产的增加，劳动者收入的增加，深深的认识到生产力解放的效果，认识到劳动人民无穷的智慧和创造力。更了解到我们的五年计划的可靠性。使我们进一步体会到毛主席
  “走群众路线”的指示的正确。由于亲身目睹，我坚信：四川在党和人民政府的英明领导下，一定能够同其他地区一样，在建设社会主义的事业中，贡献出它应有的力量。
