I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I propose that the Congress adopt them. Now, I would like to report on some of the situations I saw during my short inspection.

(I)
Representatives Zhang Zhen and I inspected the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu Province, the Dushanzi Oil Mine in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Karamay Oil Exploration Area, and the agricultural and pastoral conditions in the Northwest. Like other parts of the country, the Northwest region is experiencing vigorous development in industrial and agricultural production and construction in various fields amid the socialist upsurge.

In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, more than 10,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives have been organized, with farmer households joining accounting for 94.87% of the total. Among these, more than 2,400 are advanced cooperatives with a fully socialist nature, with farmer households joining accounting for 42.05% of the total. Cooperatives and a large number of mutual aid teams have also been organized in animal husbandry. Xinjiang used to be a region lacking grain and cotton, but now it can not only meet the needs of the region but also has a surplus that can be supplied to other regions. In particular, Xinjiang produces a wide variety of grapes and melons, which are famous at home and abroad and are exported in large quantities. Xinjiang has 300,000 square kilometers of grassland, currently grazing more than 17 million head of livestock of various kinds. Xinjiang is also very rich in mineral resources, and in recent years, deposits of oil, oil shale, coal, various iron ores, manganese, lead, mica, placer gold, as well as various chemical industry raw materials and refractory material raw materials have been discovered. The Liudaowan coal field in Urumqi, according to preliminary surveys, is one of the largest coal fields in our country, with coal seams extending for more than 100 kilometers and more than 30 layers of coal that can be mined. The Karamay oil exploration area has also been proven to be a very promising large oil field. Xinjiang has 27 large-scale modern industrial and mining enterprises under construction, and 21 more factories and mines are being built and expanded. The total industrial output value in 1955 increased by 32.5 times compared to 1949. Other undertakings such as transportation, culture, education, and health have also greatly developed.

The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are characterized by diligence, bravery, boldness, and enthusiasm. Before liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang suffered for a long time under the reactionary rule of the old warlords and the Kuomintang, which caused Xinjiang's economy and culture to stagnate for a long time. After six years of construction since liberation, Xinjiang's face has been completely changed. The correct ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao has enabled the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to live a happy and fulfilling life. In October 1955, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was established, implementing ethnic regional autonomy, which further realized the policy of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang managing their own affairs. Now Xinjiang has established 11 ethnic autonomous prefectures and counties. As Vice Premier Ulanhu said, ethnic regional autonomy has not only further strengthened the unity among and within all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, but also further consolidated the unity of the motherland and the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country.

This trip to Xinjiang and Gansu made me deeply feel that the brilliance of socialism shines on the cities and villages of the motherland, and also on the coast and the border areas. Every corner of the motherland is leaping forward in the socialist upsurge. The brilliant achievements of our great motherland in various fields of construction are truly encouraging.

(II)
Now I will talk about the situation and existing problems of the three oil fields I have seen:

1.  Since the founding of the country six years ago, there has also been great development in the petroleum industry, which is also a gratifying thing in our country's socialist construction. The Yumen Oil Mine and the Dushanzi Oil Mine both started drilling in 1939, but their development was very slow in the past, and they only achieved significant development after liberation. At present, the number of employees in the Yumen Oil Mine has increased to 11.6 times that before liberation, drilling in 1955 increased by 36 times compared to 1949, the total output value increased by more than 6 times, and oil extraction and refining have also increased by 3-4 times. The Karamay oil exploration area started drilling in July 1955, and now 9 wells are producing oil. The recent oil production from well No. 29 further proves that it is a very large oil field.

The enthusiasm of the vast number of workers in these oil fields is very high. A large number of advanced producers have emerged in production, increasing huge amounts of wealth for the country. In 1955, 167 units in the Yumen Oil Mine were rated as advanced collectives, and 1,220 people were rated as advanced workers. For example, workers in the refinery suggested appropriately increasing the temperature of the furnace tubes in the cracking workshop, and Zhang Lankai, the chief engineer of the refinery, learned from Soviet advanced experience and suggested adding a secondary reaction tower in the cracking workshop. The implementation of these two suggestions alone can increase the country's production of gasoline and kerosene by 19,899 tons per year. There are also many advanced examples in drilling and oil extraction. In the more difficult Karamay exploration area, the workers are also working selflessly, overcoming all difficulties, and completing and overfulfilling the state plan. During the five months from January to May, they overfulfilled the state drilling footage plan by 110%. The Ren Yingtang drilling team, which has maintained the title of advanced producer for many years, has achieved a drilling speed of 393 meters per day. The Qi Maosheng drilling team of well No. 33 drilled 310 meters per day, and one shift—the Tang Xiangming shift—drilled 203 meters in one shift (three shifts a day), completing two-thirds of the team's total daily drilling footage, setting a new national drilling footage record. They are constantly creating advanced production records and always planning to accumulate funds for the motherland. This high level of enthusiasm is truly admirable.

From January to April, the employees of the Yumen Oil Mine put forward a total of 2,289 rationalization proposals, of which 1,145 were adopted after research. The 182 suggestions that were implemented in the first quarter alone created and saved wealth worth 298,090 yuan. Due to the further promotion of the experience of the team economic accounting system and the implementation of the "no-raw-materials-received work day" campaign, output increased and production costs decreased, so that the total product cost in the first quarter was 39.22% lower than the state plan. It is understood that the employees of the Yumen Oil Mine can save the country wealth worth more than 50,000 taels of gold this year by collecting and utilizing waste materials. In Dushanzi and Karamay, there are also many examples of employees increasing production and saving.

2.  The development speed of these oil fields can only be achieved in a socialist country. The Yumen Oil Mine drilled and extracted oil for 10 years during the past reactionary rule, but it did not clarify the oil-bearing structure, and the output was very low. After liberation, it has achieved such great development in only 6 years. The Karamay exploration area has roughly clarified the situation of this oil field after only one year of drilling. Precisely because the drilling and extraction of oil fields have developed so quickly, some problems have also arisen:

(1) The more common problem is the supply of materials. In terms of machine tool equipment, the Yumen Oil Mine has only solved about 10%, and the supply of oil extraction equipment and general materials cannot meet the needs of production. Karamay has even more difficulties. Currently, more than 3,000 tons of steel pipes and steel plates are needed for the urgently needed construction of oil and water pipelines and oil storage tanks. Some wells are forced to be closed because they do not have oil storage tanks after oil production and cannot be transported out in time. Some wells have stopped drilling due to the lack of wellhead equipment or the failure to solve the problem of engineering water. The main reason for these problems in Karamay is the inconvenience of transportation. The road in the exploration area is on the Gobi Desert, the terrain is low-lying, and it cannot be drained, making driving extremely difficult. Although there are thousands of tons of machinery and equipment at the Horgos and Sandaohuzi border ports, they cannot be transported in time.

Insufficient material supply and poor equipment make it difficult for them to complete their tasks.

(2) The phenomenon of crowded housing is common in other industrial and mining areas, but I think the housing problem in these mining areas is even more serious. The housing problem in the Yumen Oil Mine has already been mentioned by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Representative Liu Ningyi, so I don't need to go into detail. I saw these situations with my own eyes in the Yumen Oil Mine. For example, there are not a few cases where as many as three families live together in two small rooms (including the kitchen). An engineer in the oil extraction plant lives with his family of nine in one room. Single employees live in an average of only two square meters per person. Other facilities such as canteens and hospitals are also facing similar difficulties. As for Karamay, there are no houses at all. Employees can only live in earthen kilns and tents. They have no time to demand a solution to this problem yet.

(3) The Karamay exploration area has developed rapidly in the past six months, but the organization of the exploration area has not kept pace with this development. According to the responsible comrades of the exploration area, there is currently only one drilling department, which is really unable to complete the current major tasks.

(4) The Dushanzi Mining Bureau also has some problems in organizing and leading production. The economic accounting system has not been well established in the mine. There is also a phenomenon of backlog of equipment and materials. The mine's employees saved more than 3,000 tons of mud, which was not utilized and was destroyed. More than 1,000 tons of steel materials collected by the employees were not managed, resulting in losses. Employees have a lot of opinions on this.

3.  The above are the main problems currently existing in the three oil fields. I hope that the relevant departments will solve them in a timely manner. Now I will provide my personal opinions for reference only:

(1) Strengthen oil exploration and exploitation. It has been proven that our country has a large amount of oil buried underground. The state should strengthen its organization and equipment to exploit its own untapped oil to supply the massive needs of socialist construction.

(2) The Karamay exploration area should establish oil extraction equipment as soon as possible, such as building oil selection stations, mine oil pipelines, water pipelines, machine repair plants, and power plants to meet the needs of current development.

(3) Strengthen transportation. Currently, the most difficult problem in Karamay is transportation. If it is not solved in time, machinery, equipment and supplies cannot be transported in, and the extracted oil cannot be transported out.

(4) Accelerate the training of petroleum technicians. Currently, there is a shortage of technical personnel in drilling, extraction, and refining. If we continue to expand the petroleum industry in the future, it will be insufficient to meet the needs of development if we do not accelerate the training of technical personnel.

(5) Ensure the supply of necessary materials. The mining area is surrounded by barren mountains or the Gobi Desert. There are no people within dozens of miles outside the mining area, and there is an urgent need for the supply of vegetables, meat, and other daily necessities. The demand for cultural and recreational life is also very urgent, and they yearn to see movies and dramas. For example, the Yumen Oil Mine only has one cinema and one theater, which cannot meet the needs of the vast number of employees.

The above are my superficial views. If there are any errors, please correct them.

    西北三个油田的状况和存在的问题
    ——曾泽生代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程
  （草案）的说明，以及彭真副委员长所作全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，并建议大会予以通过。现在，我想把我在短期视察中所看到的一些情况，汇报一下。
                         （一）
    我和张轸代表，到甘肃省和新疆维吾尔自治区，视察了甘肃玉门油矿，新疆独山子油矿，克拉玛依石油探区和西北的农牧业等情况。西北地区和全国其他地方一样，在社会主义高潮中，工农业生产和其他各方面的建设，都在蓬勃发展。
    在新疆维吾尔自治区，已组织了1万多个农业生产合作社，入社农户占总农户的94.87％，其中完全社会主义性质的高级社2，400多个，入社农户占总农户的42.05％。在畜牧业中也组织了合作社和大量的互助组。原来新疆是个粮棉缺乏的地方，现在不但能够满足本地区的需要，而且还有剩余，可以外调供给其他地区。特别是新疆出产品种繁多的葡萄，瓜果，著名国内外，并大量出口。新疆有30万平方公里的草原，目前放牧各种牲畜1，700多万头。新疆的矿藏也非常丰富，近几年来已经发现的有：石油、油母页岩、煤、各种铁矿、锰、铅、云母、沙金以及各种化学工业原料和耐火器材原料。乌鲁木齐市六道湾的煤田，据初步勘查证明，是我国最大的煤田之一，煤系达百余公里，可采煤30多层。克拉玛依石油探区也已经证明是一个很有希望的大油田。新疆有27座规模巨大的现代化工矿，正在修建和扩建的厂矿还有21座。1955年工业总产值比1949年增长了32.5倍。其他如交通运输、文教卫生等事业，也有了很大的发展。
    新疆各族人民的特点是勤劳、勇敢、豪放、热情。解放前新疆各民族人民曾长期遭受了旧军阀和国民党的反动统治，使新疆的经济、文化长期停滞不前。解放后经过六年来的建设，已经完全改变了新疆的面貌。中国共产党和毛主席正确的民族政策，使新疆各民族人民过着美满幸福的生活。1955年10月成立新疆维吾尔自治区，实行民族区域自治，进一步实现了新疆各民族人民管理本民族事务的政策，现在新疆已建立了11个民族自治州和县。正如乌兰夫副总理所说的，民族区域自治不仅进一步加强了新疆各民族间和民族内部的团结，而且也进一步巩固了祖国的统一和全国各民族大团结。
    这次新疆甘肃之行，使我深深感到社会主义的光辉照到了祖国的城市和乡村，也照到了沿海和边疆，祖国的每一个角落，在社会主义高潮中，都在飞跃前进。我们伟大祖国在各方面建设的辉煌成就，实在是令人欢欣鼓舞的。
                          （二）
    现在我谈谈看过的三个油田的状况和存在的问题：
    1、建国六年以来，在石油工业方面也有了很大的发展，这也是我国社会主义建设事业中使人高兴的一件事。玉门油矿和独山子油矿，虽然都是从1939年就开始钻探，但是过去发展很慢，到解放以后才得到长足的发展。目前玉门油矿的职工人数，已增加为解放前的11.6倍，1955年钻井比1949年增长了36倍，总产值增长了6倍多，采油和炼油也都增长了3—4倍。克拉玛依石油探区是由1955年7月开始钻探的，现已有9口井出油，最近29号井出油后，更足以证明它是一个面积很大的油田。
    这些油田广大职工的积极性是很高的，在生产中涌现了大量的先进生产者，为国家增产了巨额的财富，玉门油矿在1955年评为先进集体的有167个单位，评为先进工作者的有1，220人。如炼油厂工人建议适当提高裂炼车间炉管的温度，炼油厂总工程师张兰凯学习苏联先进经验，建议在裂炼车间加装一座二级反应塔，仅这两项建议实现后，每年就可以为国家增产19，899吨汽油和煤油。在钻井和采油方面也都有不少先进事例。条件比较困难的克拉玛依探区，职工群众也在忘我的劳动，克服一切困难，完成和超额完成国家计划。他们在1月——5月的5个月期间，超额完成国家计划钻井进尺的110％。历年来都保持先进生产者称号的任应堂钻井队，已经达到一天钻进393公尺。33号井齐茂生钻井队一天钻进310公尺，而其中一个班——唐相明班一班钻进203公尺（一天三班），完成全队全天钻井进尺的三分之二，创全国钻井进尺的新纪录。他们时时在创造先进生产纪录，处处为祖国积累资金打算，这种高度的热情，实在使人崇敬。
    玉门油矿全矿职工在1——4月份共提出合理化建议2，289件，经研究采纳的有1，145件，仅是第一季度已经实现的182件建议，就创造与节约了价值298，090元的财富。由于进一步推广了班组经济核算制的经验，开展“不领原材料工作日”运动，增加了产量，降低了生产费用，使第一季度全部产品成本比国家计划降低39.22％。据了解玉门油矿职工通过收集和利用废料，今年全年可为国家节约价值5万多两金子的财富。在独山子和克拉玛依，职工增产节约的事例也不少。
    2、这些油田的发展速度，只有在社会主义的国家才能实现的。玉门油矿在过去反动统治时期钻采了10年，还未弄清储油构造，产量也很低；解放后仅仅6年的时间，就有了这样巨大的发展。克拉玛依探区只经过一年的钻探，就大致摸清了这个油田的情况。也正是由于油田钻采的发展很快，所以也产生了一些问题：
      （1）比较普遍的是物资供应问题。玉门油矿在机床设备方面只解决了10％左右，采油设备和一般材料的供应，也不能满足生产的需要。克拉玛依困难更多，目前急需建设的输油、输水管道和储油缶，即需钢管、钢板等3，000多吨；有的井出油后没有油缶储油，又不能及时运出，致被迫封闭；有些井因无井口装置或工程用水得不到解决而停钻。克拉玛依产生这些问题主要是因交通运输不便所造成的。该探区的公路在戈壁滩上，地势低洼，不能排水，行车极感困难。虽在霍城和三道河子国境口岸有几千吨机器、器材，也不能即时运来。
    材料供应不够，设备不好，使他们完成任务发生困难。
    （2）其他工矿区普遍存在着住宅拥挤现象，我看这几个矿区的住宅问题就更加严重。玉门油矿住宅困难问题，李富春副总理和刘宁一代表在发言中已经提到了，我不必细讲。我在玉门油矿亲眼看到了这些情况。如前后两间小房子（包括厨房），竟多至三家合住的情况不在少数。采油厂一个工程师一家九口人只住一间房子。单身职工平均每人只住两平方公尺。其他如食堂、医院等也同样感到困难。至于克拉玛依根本就没有房子，职工只能挖土窑住和住在帐棚里，他们现在还无暇要求解决这个问题。
    （3）克拉玛依探区半年来发展很快，但探区机构却未能与此发展相适应。据该探区负责同志反映，现在只有一个钻探处，实在不能完成目前的重大任务。
      （4）独山子矿务局在组织领导生产方面也存在一些问题。经济核算制度在该矿没有很好建立起来。器材也有积压现象。该矿职工节约了3，000多吨泥浆，没有得到利用，而被毁掉；职工们收集的1，000多吨钢铁材料，无人管理，以致散失。职工对此意见很多。
    3、以上所说的是三个油田目前存在的主要问题。希望有关部门及时的加以解决。现在仅把我个人的几点意见，提供参考：
      （1）加强石油的勘探与开采工作。现已证明我国是有大量的石油在埋藏着，国家应当加强组织力量和设备，开采自己未开的石油，以供应社会主义建设中的大量需要。
      （2）克拉玛依探区，应尽快建立采油设备，如修建选油站、矿山输油管、输水管、机器修配厂、发电厂等，以适应目前发展的需要。
      （3）加强交通运输工作。目前克拉玛依最感困难的是交通运输问题。若不及时解决，则机器、器材供应品运不进去，已采的油运不出来。
      （4）加速培养石油技术人员。目前无论钻、采、炼那一方面都感到技术力量不够。今后继续扩充石油工业，如不加速培养技术人员，实不足以应发展的需要。
      （5）保证必需的物资的供应。矿区周围不是荒山就是戈壁，矿区以外几十里都无人烟，急切需要菜蔬、肉食以及其他日用品的供应。对于文化娱乐生活，要求也很迫切，渴望看到电影和戏剧。如玉门油矿只有一个电影场和一个剧场，是不能满足广大职工需要的。
    以上肤浅之见，如有错误，请予指正。
