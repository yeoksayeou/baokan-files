    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1955 and 1956 national budget and final accounts, Minister Liao Luyan’s explanation of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen’s work report. Now, in light of the spirit of the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives, I would like to report on the agricultural cooperation movement in our province, the income distribution of agricultural cooperatives, and sideline production.
      
    Brief Overview of Agricultural Cooperation Development
    The agricultural cooperation movement in Sichuan Province has developed particularly rapidly in the past year. From last winter to this spring, in just half a year, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the province increased from more than 50,000 to more than 200,000, and the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives increased from more than 2.25 million, accounting for only 17.4% of the total number of farmer households, to more than 10.03 million, accounting for 77.8% of the total number of farmer households in the province. Among them, there are 1,861 advanced cooperatives, accounting for 4% of the total number of farmer households. Compared with other parts of the country, the agricultural cooperation movement in our province appears to be lagging behind, especially the development of advanced cooperatives is even worse. However, judging from the specific situation in our province and from our overall plan for the development of agricultural cooperation, the pace of the cooperative movement in our province is still relatively appropriate. The reason why it is appropriate is that, in addition to the relatively weak work foundation in our province in the past, we also considered the following situations:
    1. There are still many problems with the cooperatives that have been established. On the one hand, they were established late, have weak core members, and lack management experience. On the other hand, some cooperatives have impatient and rash sentiments, wanting to run large cooperatives and setting production targets too high. It is necessary to give them a certain amount of time for vigorous rectification and consolidation.
    2. The focus of rural work in March and April is spring plowing and production, and the superiority of cooperatives is specifically reflected in increasing production. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the time and free up hands to vigorously lead production.
    3. Rural work is busy and crowded, and all tasks must be arranged in a unified manner with a plan and steps, and carried out in combination with each other.
    4. Experience has shown that the more adequate the preparatory work and the more thorough the rectification work, the more favorable conditions are created for the future transition to advanced cooperatives.
    Based on the above situation, in order to ensure increased production and ensure that 90% of the members increase their income, and to complete the task of establishing cooperatives in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, we have taken the following main measures:
    First, we consolidated and rectified the established agricultural cooperatives, formulated four plans for agricultural production, sideline production, labor allocation, and financial revenue and expenditure, formulated work quotas, implemented a system of contracted work, contracted production, and overproduction rewards, carried out short-term work arrangements, and initially established a management system. It takes a relatively long time to do the above work well, and the purpose of doing the above work well is to create conditions and lay a solid foundation for the transition to advanced cooperatives.
    Second, we vigorously led agricultural production, and put forward the slogan of "Do a good job in production to welcome the establishment of cooperatives." During the establishment of cooperatives, we took the approach of immediately organizing forces to make production arrangements as soon as the framework was set up, so that the cooperative movement was closely integrated with agricultural production from beginning to end.
    Through the above measures, the quality of the cooperatives has been greatly improved. Now, the first category of cooperatives accounts for 50% of the total number of cooperatives, the second category accounts for 40% of the total number of cooperatives, and the third category accounts for only 10% of the total number of cooperatives. The broad masses of cooperative members demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm in this year's spring plowing and production, and the labor attendance rate generally increased by about 20% compared with last year. In the existing elementary cooperatives, except for about 10% of the members who still have some concerns about transitioning to advanced cooperatives, the vast majority of members have the desire to run advanced cooperatives. Many cooperatives have now established joint cooperative committees or cooperative establishment preparatory committees, actively creating conditions for transitioning to advanced cooperatives.
    Judging from the current situation, the conditions for transitioning the existing more than 190,000 elementary agricultural production cooperatives to advanced cooperatives before the end of the year have gradually matured. We plan to carry out cooperative expansion work from June to August, requiring the total number of farmer households joining the cooperatives to reach about 95%. Before the autumn harvest, we will prepare about 25% of the elementary cooperatives for the transition, and immediately transition them to advanced cooperatives after the autumn harvest is basically completed. At the same time, we will further prepare to transition the remaining majority of elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives after the autumn harvest and before the end of the year. Strive for about 85% of farmers to participate in advanced cooperatives.
    In general, the main problems currently existing in rectifying and consolidating cooperatives, and in transitioning from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, are that the production plans and management systems of some cooperatives have not been seriously established, or the plans are set too high and are not realistic, thus directly or indirectly affecting the consolidation and improvement of the cooperatives. Or some cooperatives are eager to transition to advanced cooperatives, but do not actively prepare for it, or are unwilling to run cooperatives with one or two hundred households during the transition, but are eager to run large cooperatives with thousands of households or several thousand households. These are all thoughts and emotions with impatience and blindness, which are worthy of our attention in future work.
    The Situation of Agricultural Production This Year
    The development of the agricultural cooperation movement itself has promoted the development of agricultural production. In 1955, the province's total grain output was 40.4 billion catties, 38% higher than in 1949 and 25.8% higher than the highest annual output before liberation (1932). In this year's spring production, the vast number of farmers have a great enthusiasm for production, and the output of spring crops has overfulfilled the original plan. Most cooperatives have achieved increased production. The province originally planned to sow more than 18.28 million mu of wheat, and the actual planting area exceeded 7.16%. This year, the province's total wheat output increased by more than 10% compared with last year. The province's paddy fields have generally been planted, with more than 7 million mu of early rice planted with double-cropping rice, more than two and a half times the original plan. The seedlings are growing well, and the early ones are already budding. The transplanting work of middle-season rice has basically ended by the end of May, except for a few later-season hills and mountainous areas. The planting area is generally larger than in previous years. If field management is done well, this year's grain output is expected to reach 44.52 billion catties, an increase of 10% over 1955, accounting for 106.6% of the Five-Year Plan, that is, completing the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. However, according to the situation learned in the last five days, there have been continuous heavy rains in northwest Sichuan in recent days. For example, the rainfall in Zhaohua County has reached 510 mm, which is unprecedented in the past 60 or 70 years. As a result, the river water in all rivers has risen sharply, and the middle and lower reaches have been flooded. According to preliminary statistics from 28 counties in Mianyang, Daxian, and Leshan, the affected farmland has reached more than 230,000 mu, 108 people have died, and 5.65 million catties of grain have been lost. The People's Committee has held an emergency meeting and is taking measures to rescue the victims.
    According to the current situation of production development, it is entirely possible to complete the plan of achieving an annual grain output of 800 catties per mu within 7 years and more than 900 catties per mu within 12 years in the province. Because many large areas of high output have appeared in various places, such as 12 agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Chengdu City, with an average output of more than 1,000 catties per mu. There are also similar examples of high yield in hills and mountainous areas. Therefore, we believe that we are confident of completing the requirements for increasing grain production stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program.
      
    The main problems currently existing in the development of agricultural production are that the general production plans are set too high and have unrealistic blind situations. For example, the original plans for increasing production in Yibin and Fuling were too high. Later, they were suppressed after investigation and accounting. Secondly, there is a shortage of fertilizer, and there are still many problems in farming techniques. Moreover, the price of fertilizer is generally too high, which is worthy of our good attention and continued efforts to solve in the future.
    Income Distribution of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Whether the income distribution work of agricultural production cooperatives is done well is related to whether 90% of the members can increase their income. At the same time, it is also related to whether the cooperatives can develop and consolidate, and whether all members can be more actively and automatically engaged in production. If the cooperative can ensure that 90% of the members can obtain increased production income after increasing production, it will solve the contradiction between individuals, especially between individuals and the collective, and consolidate the new production relations of the cooperative. Therefore, correctly handling the income distribution problem of cooperatives is an extremely important policy issue in whether cooperative work can be done well at this stage, and we must pay great attention to it and do this work vigorously.
      
    At present, the problem affecting the increase in income of members in our province is that rural sideline production has decreased compared with the past. Some cooperatives are fond of great achievements and eager to run welfare undertakings. Many places prematurely mobilized agricultural cooperatives to engage in small-scale hydropower stations, build offices, members' residences, repair roads, erect power lines, install loudspeakers, build sports fields, etc., which made the cooperatives burdened too much and wasted manpower and materials. In order to ensure that 90% of the members can increase their income, we have decided to take the following measures:
      1. In addition to ensuring the completion of the 10% increase in grain production this year, we must also vigorously develop sideline production so that farmers can increase their income from various sideline industries.
      2. Implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. (1) The basic construction of cooperatives should establish a certain approval system, stipulating the limit of labor and cash expenditure. Expenditures exceeding the limit should be reported to the higher authorities for approval. (2) The expenditure of the cooperative's production management expenses and the subsidy work points for the cooperative cadres to manage the cooperative affairs should be controlled. (3) It is necessary to establish and improve the financial accounting system. Accountants have the right to refuse to report expenses that do not comply with the system, and cashiers have the right to refuse to pay. (4) All cultural and welfare undertakings run by cooperatives must be controlled within the scope that the cooperative's public welfare fund can bear.
      3. Correctly implement the income distribution policy of agricultural cooperatives. In addition to ensuring the completion of the payment of agricultural taxes and the state's unified purchase of agricultural products, the amount of production expenses, public accumulation funds, and public welfare funds retained by the cooperatives must also be set at an appropriate proportion, and cannot be retained too much.
      4. In order to ensure that 90% of the members increase their income, the following specific issues must also be addressed in the distribution:
    (1) In the event of irresistible disasters that severely reduce the production of cooperatives, the state must provide appropriate reductions, exemptions, postponements, or considerations from public grain surcharges and loans.
      (2) For the "five guarantees" households and the poor households, which account for about 15% of the total number of members, it is necessary to find ways to ensure that their income increases.
    (3) When the expansion of old cooperatives or the merger with new cooperatives affects the reduction of income of old members, the method of deducting less public accumulation funds and rewarding old members or production teams that have good production labor can be considered to make up for it in the distribution. Or use the method of retaining part of the mobile number in the total income to take care of it. But no matter which method is adopted, it must be discussed and approved by the members' congress.
      (4) Conscientiously do a good job in collecting the production cost share fund. For members who are indeed in economic difficulty, a phased payment plan should be formulated.
    At present, the main tendency in the income distribution of cooperatives is to pay too much attention to the interests of the collective and not enough attention to the interests of individuals. In terms of increasing the income of agricultural cooperatives, more attention is paid to increasing the production of grain and cash crops, and not enough attention is paid to engaging in more sideline production to increase the income of members. Although this issue has been emphasized, it has not been fully reversed in actual work.
        
    Engaging in More Sideline Production
    The types of sideline production in Sichuan Province are relatively numerous, and they are easy to carry out due to favorable conditions such as weather and soil quality. State-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives alone purchase more than 800 kinds of local and special products, including more than 300 kinds of Chinese medicinal materials. Farmers' sideline income generally accounts for 20-25% of the total agricultural and sideline income, and the proportion of sideline income in mountainous areas is even greater. This is a great wealth. Although the production of rural sideline industries has increased year by year in recent years, if we take several major local and special products, such as silkworm cocoons, tea, gallnuts, and white wax, they have not yet recovered to the highest annual output in history. In particular, the province's sideline income in 1955 decreased by 15% compared with 1954. One of the main reasons for the decrease in income is that after the rapid development of cooperatives last year, the new and old production relations are undergoing a process of change. In particular, from the perspective of leadership, we have not emphasized the development of sideline production enough, which also has a certain impact.
    The reduction of pigs is a major problem in the reduction of rural sideline industries and has a significant relationship to increased agricultural production. According to statistics, the number of pigs decreased by about 10% in 1955 compared with 1954. This year, compared with February of last year, it has decreased by about 5%. This is an issue that must be paid close attention to. The reduction of pigs not only affects the supply of meat for urban and rural people, but also affects the export of meat, affects farmers' income, and affects the source of fertilizer for crops. It is understood that the reasons for the reduction of pig raising are as follows:
    1. The impact of the change in production relations from individual to collective. That is, in the past, farmers raised pigs themselves, accumulated fertilizer themselves, and the increase in agricultural production was entirely for their own benefit. After cooperativization, the pigs raised by farmers and the fertilizer accumulated were sometimes owned by the cooperative, but the pricing was not reasonable enough. And after the increase in grain production, the grain was collectively owned by the whole cooperative, and they could not get more for themselves. This is one of the reasons that affects farmers' own pig raising.
    2. When the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain was implemented in 1953, we did not pay enough attention to properly solving the feed problem. In addition, wealthy farmers were dissatisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sale, creating a tense atmosphere, so there was a phenomenon of castrating sows and discarding piglets. Although the above phenomena have long been stopped, it is still necessary to continue to work hard to promote this work before the end of this winter to fully restore and have new development.
    3. In recent years, various places have emphasized increasing grain output, thus relatively reducing the area of coarse grains and feed crops. The land retained by members is generally planted with vegetables, and there is no place to plant feed crops. In addition, feed substitutes have not been widely promoted, so the shortage of feed has also affected the increase in the number of pig raising.
    4. In terms of the purchase price of fat pigs, commercial profits are too high, and this unreasonable price also has a certain impact.
    In order to correct these shortcomings and develop pigs in large numbers, we have made the following arrangements:
      (1) Actively and prudently develop the public pigs of agricultural cooperatives. The main method at present is self-breeding and self-raising. And vigorously restore and maintain the original number of private pigs, in order to restore and maintain the number of 20 million heads in the province in 1955.
      (2) Establish feed bases, increase the planting of one season of crops or plant certain high-yield crops, in order to expand and open up other new sources of feed, and promote feed substitutes and feed silage, etc.
      (3) Rationally adjust the purchase price of fat pigs. The Provincial People's Committee is currently studying and dealing with it. The principle is to appropriately reduce commercial profits so that farmers can make a profit from raising pigs and are happy to raise more.
    Since we seized this problem in March and April, according to reports from various places recently, the number of pigs raised has begun to increase. We believe that the plan to develop 23 million pigs this year can be realized.
    For other sideline industries, such as purchasing Chinese medicinal materials, we have also taken various necessary measures. In terms of strengthening leadership, we have decided that the People's Committees at all levels will establish sideline production offices or sideline production committees to strengthen the leadership of sideline production. In the plan of sideline and agricultural production, a unified arrangement has been made again. In the relationship between members' individual sideline production and the collective sideline production of the whole cooperative, as well as strengthening various sideline production technical guidance, holding various sideline professional short-term training, etc., necessary mobilization and deployment have been made.
    Due to the rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement, and the continuous improvement and increase in production on the agricultural production front, and the continuous increase in production and income of farmers, this not only shows the superiority of agricultural cooperatives themselves, but also promoted the rapid arrival of the upsurge of socialist transformation of handicraft industry and capitalist industry and commerce in our province, and promoted the all-round development of industry, commerce, basic construction, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings in our province. Many old production quotas have been broken through. Completing and overfulfilling the state plan has become the action slogan of the vast number of employees. People's lives and people's purchasing power are also constantly improving and increasing. The above-mentioned prosperous scene is an important sign that our country is increasingly moving towards a socialist society.

    四川省农业合作化运动的情况
    ——李大章代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年与1956年国家预决算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明，以及彭真副委员长的工作报告。现在我想根据高级农业生产合作社示范章程的精神，就我省农业合作化运动，农业合作社的收益分配以及副业生产等问题，汇报一些情况。
      农业合作化发展的简况
    四川省的农业合作化运动，一年以来发展得特别迅速，从去冬到今春，仅仅半年的时间，全省的农业合作社即由原来的5万多个，发展到20多万个，入社农户由原来只占总农户17.4％的225万多户，发展到现在1，003万多户，占全省总农户的77.8％。其中高级社1，861个，占总农户的4％。以上数字，如与全国各地比较，我省的农业合作化运动显得是落后的，特别是高级社发展得更差。但从我省的具体情况看，从我们对农业合作化发展的整个规划看，合作化运动在我省的进展速度，还是比较适当的。其所以适当，除了我省由于过去工作基础较为薄弱外，我们还考虑到以下一些情况：
    1．现在发展起来的合作社，还存在着不少问题，一方面是建社迟，骨干弱，缺乏经营管理经验，另一方面是某些社有急躁冒进情绪，想办大社以及产量订的偏高等等，必须有一定时间给以大力整顿和巩固。
    2．三、四月份农村工作的中心是春耕生产，而合作社的优越性又具体的体现在增加生产上面，因此就必须抓紧时间，腾出手来大力领导生产。
    3．农村工作繁忙拥挤，各项工作不能不有计划有步骤地作统一的安排和互相结合起来进行。
    4．经验证明，准备工作越充分，整社工作越彻底，就为将来转入高级社创造了更为有利的条件。
    根据以上情况，在保证增加生产，保证90％的社员增加收入的前提下，能又多、又好的完成建社任务，我们采取了以下一些主要措施：
    首先，对已建立的农业社进行了巩固整顿工作，制定了农业生产、副业生产、劳力调配、财务收支等四个计划，制定了工作定额，实行了包工包产和超产奖励制度，进行了短期作业安排，把经营管理制度初步的建立起来。要作好以上这些工作，是需要一个较长时间的，而作好以上工作的目的，是为转入高级社创造条件打实基础。
    其次，大力领导了农业生产，提出了
  “搞好生产，迎接建社”的口号。在建社期间，采取了架子一搭起来，就立刻组织力量进行生产安排，使合作化运动，自始至终都与农业生产密切地结合进行。
    经过上述措施，合作社的质量，就大大提高了。现在第一类社占总社数的50％，第二类社占总社数40％，第三类社仅占总社数10％。广大社员群众在今年春耕生产中，表现了高度的劳动生产积极性，劳动出勤率一般比去年提高20％左右。在现有初级社中，除了约占10％左右的社员对于转升高级社还有一些顾虑外，绝大多数社员都有办高级社的要求。不少合作社现在已建立了联社委员会或建社筹备委员会，积极地在创造转升高级社的条件。
    从现在的情况看，把现有的19万多个初级农业生产合作社，在年前转升为高级社的条件已经逐渐的成熟了。我们计划在6月至8月进行扩社工作，要求入社总农户共达到95％左右。秋收以前把约占25％的初级社的转社准备工作作好，待秋收基本完毕，即立刻转为高级社。同时并进一步地准备在秋后与年前，把其余的绝大部分的初级社转升为高级社。争取参加高级社的农户能够达到85％左右。
    总的说来，目前在整顿、巩固合作社中，以及由初级社转到高级社所存在的问题，主要是有些社的生产计划和经营管理制度等还未认真的建立起来，或计划订的偏高不切合实际，因而直接和间接地影响了社的巩固与提高，或有些社虽急于想转到高级社，但不积极地作准备工作，或在转社时不愿意搞一、二百户的社，而急于想搞千多户或几千户的大社，这些都是带有急躁和盲目的思想情绪，是值得我们在今后工作中注意的。
    今年农业生产的情况
    农业合作化运动的发展，本身就促进了农业生产的发展。1955年全省粮食产量为404亿斤，比1949年高38％，比解放前（1932年）最高年产量高25.8％，今年小春生产中，广大农民生产劲头很大，小春作物的产量超额完成了原订计划，大多数合作社都获得增产，全省原计划播种小麦1，828万多亩，实际播种面积超过了7.16％，今年全省小麦总产量比去年增产10％以上，现在全省的稻田大体已栽插完毕，共栽种双季稻的早稻700多万亩，超过原计划的两倍半，秧苗生长良好，早的已经含苞。中稻栽插工作，至5月底除少数季节较迟的丘陵和山区以外，已经基本结束。栽插面积一般比往年扩大，如果搞好田间管理工作，今年的粮食产量预计将能达到445.2亿斤，比1955年增产10％，为五年计划的106.6％，即提前一年完成五年计划。但据最近五天所了解的情况，近几日来川西北连日大雨，如昭化县等降雨量竟达510公厘，是六、七十年来所未有，因之各河河水暴涨，中下游已泛滥成灾，如根据绵阳、达县、乐山等三个专区二十八个县初步统计，受害田亩已达23万多亩，死了108人，损失粮食565万斤，现在人民委员会已召开紧急会议，正在采取措施抢救中。
    根据目前生产发展情况来看，要在全省7年内完成每亩粮食年产量达到800斤，12年内达到900斤以上的计划是完全可能的。因为各地已经出现了不少大面积的高额产量，如成都市郊区即有12个农业生产合作社，平均每亩产量达到1，000斤以上，另在丘陵与山区也都有类似丰产的事例。因此，我们认为全国农业发展纲要上所规定的增产粮食的要求，我们是有把握完成的。
      目前在发展农业生产中所存在的问题，主要是一般生产计划订的偏高，带有不切合实际的盲目情况，如宜宾、涪陵专署等原订今年的增产计划都是偏高的，后来经调查算账后才压下来了。其次是肥料不足，耕作技术也还存在不少问题。而且肥料的价格订的偏高的情况较为普遍，这是值得我们今后很好注意和继续设法解决的。
    农业生产合作社的收益分配
    是否作好农业生产合作社的收益分配工作，它关系于90％的社员能否增加收入的问题，同时更是联系到合作社能否发展与巩固的问题，联系到所有社员能否更积极自动搞好生产的问题。如果合作社在增加生产后，确能保证90％的社员都能获得增产的收益，那就解决了个体与个体之间特别是个体与集体之间的矛盾，将合作社的新的生产关系巩固起来。因此，正确的处理合作社的收益分配问题，是现阶段能否搞好合作社工作的极其重大的一项政策问题，必须引起我们十分重视，并大力作好这一工作。
      目前在我省影响社员增加收入的问题是农村副业已比过去有所减少，部分社好大喜功，急于兴办福利事业，不少地方过早的动员农业社搞小型水电站，修建办公室，社员住宅，修公路，架电线，安喇叭，修运动场等等，使合作社负担过重，浪费了人力、物力。为了保证90％的社员能够增加收入，我们决定采取如下措施：
      1．除保证完成今年粮食增产10％外，还必须大力发展副业，使农民能增加各项副业收入。
      2．贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针。（1）合作社的基本建设，要建立一定的审批制度，规定动用劳动力和开支现金的限额，超过限额的要报请上级机关批准。（2）社的生产管理费用的开支以及社干管理社务的补助工分，均应有所控制。（3）必须建立与健全财务会计制度，凡是不合制度的开支，会计有权拒绝上报，出纳有权拒绝支付。（4）合作社举办一切文化福利事业，必须控制在社内的公益金能负担的范围以内。
      3．正确贯彻执行农业合作社的收益分配政策。除必须保证完成缴纳农业税和国家对农产品的统购任务外，对于合作社的生产费用、公积金和公益金提留的数量还必须制定适当的比例，不能提留过多。
      4．为了保证90％的社员增加收入，在分配中还必须注意解决以下几个具体问题：
    （1）遇到不可抗拒的灾害，使合作社严重减产，国家必须从公粮附加粮和贷款中，给以适当的减免或推迟和照顾。
      （2）对于“五保”户和约占社员总数15％左右的贫困户，必须设法保证他们的收入有所增加。
    （3）对于因老社扩大或和新社合并影响到老社员减少收入时，分配中可考虑采用少扣公积金，和多奖励生产劳动好的老社员或生产队的办法加以弥补。或采用在总收入中提留部分机动数加以照顾。但不论采用那种办法，都必须经过社员大会讨论通过。
      （4）认真作好生产费股份基金收集工作，对于经济确有困难的社员，应制定分期分批的收缴计划。
    目前合作社收益分配中的主要倾向，是注意集体利益的方面过多，而对于个人利益方面照顾不足，在增加农业社收入方面，注意于粮食和经济作物方面的增产多，对多搞副业生产以增加社员收入则注意不够，现虽强调了这一问题，但在实际工作中还未全面转过来。
        多搞副业生产
    四川省副业生产的种类是比较繁多的，而且由于天时与土质等有利条件也易于搞起来。单是国营商业和供销合作社收购的土特产品就有800多种，其中中药材就有300多种，农民的副业收入，一般平均占农副业总收入的20—25％，而山区副业收入所占的比例就更大，这是一笔很大的财富。历年来农村副业的生产虽逐年有所增加，但如以几宗主要的土特产品，蚕茧、茶叶、五棓子、白蜡等也还没有恢复到历史上的最高的年产量，特别是1955年全省的副业收入比1954年又减少了15％。收入减少的主要原因之一，是由于合作社在去年大发展后，新旧生产关系正在发生变化的过程，特别从领导上来讲，我们对于发展副业生产强调不够，也是有一定影响的。
    在农村副业减少比例较大，而且对于农业增产有重大关系的是生猪减少，据统计1955年比1954年减少了10％左右。今年2月同去年2月比较，又减少了5％左右，这是必须引起我们十分注意的问题。由于生猪的减少，不仅影响到城乡人民的肉食供应，而且也影响了肉食的出口，影响了农民的收入，影响了农作物肥料的来源。养猪减少的原因，据了解有如下几点：
    1．由个体到集体，生产关系发生了变化的影响。即以往是农民自己喂猪，自己积肥，农业增产完全为自己所有。合作化后，农民所养的猪，所积的肥，有时由于收归社有而所定价不够合理，以及在粮食增产之后，粮食又为全社集体所有，自己也不能多得，这是影响农民自己养猪的原因之一。
    2．从1953年开始实施粮食统购统销政策时，我们没有足够的注意妥善解决饲料问题，加以富裕的农民对统购统销政策不满，制造紧张空气，因而曾经发生过阉割母猪、丢弃小猪的现象。以上现象虽早已停止，但全部恢复并有新的发展，还须得今冬以前继续努力推动这一工作。
    3．近几年来各地强调了增加粮食产量，因而相对地缩小了杂粮和饲料作物的面积，社员自留土地，一般又都种了蔬菜，没有地方再种饲料作物了。再加上饲料代用品尚未得到普遍推广，因为饲料不足，也就影响了养猪数量的增加。
    4．在肥猪收购价格上，商业利润偏高，这种不太合理的价格也有一定的影响。
    为了纠正这些缺点，并大量发展生猪，我们已作了以下一些部署：
      （1）积极而又稳慎的发展农业社的公有猪。当前的主要办法是自繁自养。并大力恢复和保持原有私猪头数，以期恢复和保持到1955年全省2，000万头的数目。
      （2）建立饲料基地，增种一季作物或多种某些高产作物，以扩大和开辟其他新的饲料来源，并推广饲料代用品和饲料青贮等等办法。
      （3）合理调整肥猪收购价格。现省人民委员会正在研究处理中，原则是适当压低商业利润，使农民养猪有利可图，乐于多养。
    自我们在三、四月份抓紧了这个问题后，最近据各地反映，养猪头数已开始增加，我们相信今年生猪发展到2，300万头的计划是可以实现的。
    对于其他副业生产，如收购中药材等，我们也采取了各种必要的措施。如以加强领导讲，我们已决定各级人民委员会建立副业生产办公室或副业生产委员会，以加强对副业生产的领导。在副业与农业生产的计划上，都重新作了统一的安排。在社员个人搞副业生产和全社集体搞副业生产的关系上，以及加强各种副业生产技术指导，举办各种副业专业的短期训练等等，都作了必要的动员与部署。
    由于农业合作化运动的迅速发展，以及在农业生产战线上的不断获得提高与增产，和农民不断增加生产和增加收入，这不仅仅显示了农业合作社本身的优越性，而且推动了我省手工业和资本主义工商业社会主义改革高潮的迅速到来，推动了我省的工业、商业、基本建设、交通运输和文化教育事业等的全面发展。过去许多旧的生产定额被突破了。完成与超额完成国家计划，已成为广大职工的行动口号。人民的生活和人民购买力也不断获得改善和提高。以上这种种繁荣的景象，就是我们国家日益走向社会主义社会的重要标志。
