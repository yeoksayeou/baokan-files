Do a Good Job in the Ideological Remolding of Capitalists
——Speech by Representative Liu Peizhi

    I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan’s explanation on the draft model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen’s report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. Our Heilongjiang Province Democratic National Construction Association and Federation of Industry and Commerce at all levels will further unite and mobilize industrialists and businessmen throughout the province, under the leadership of the Party and government, and actively use practical actions to strive to realize the national budget and the model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, to comprehensively advance and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan, and especially to continue to thoroughly complete the various tasks undertaken in the socialist transformation.
    With the advent of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce nationwide has entered a new stage. The transformation of private industry and commerce in various cities and counties of our province has basically achieved industry-wide joint state-private ownership at an unprecedented speed, on a grand scale, and with healthy steps. This is a great victory. This victory is due to the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great people’s leader Chairman Mao, and to the continuous education of industrialists and businessmen by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Provincial People’s Committee and local Party and government: the ideological consciousness of industrialists and businessmen has been improved, thus they actively accept socialist transformation. This victory also shows that the state’s policy of peaceful transformation of private industry and commerce is completely correct. Only by accepting transformation and taking the socialist road can the vast number of industrialists and businessmen have a bright future.
    In this upsurge of the transformation movement, industrialists and businessmen in our province generally received a profound and practical socialist education, and their ideological awareness has been significantly improved. In particular, Chairman Mao’s deeply rooted instructions, like the sun, illuminated the path for the industrial and commercial circles, giving industrialists and businessmen infinite warmth and hope, clarifying the laws of social development, recognizing the great future of the country and themselves, and understanding how to master their own destiny, further loving the motherland and actively accepting transformation. Therefore, many industrialists and businessmen, whether in meetings or in newspapers and periodicals, deeply reviewed their past exploitative behavior and erroneous thoughts, and carried out a relatively deep criticism and self-criticism in the industrial and commercial circles, vowing to listen to Chairman Mao, take the socialist road, and strive to perform meritorious service in the transformation with practical actions. Many industrialists and businessmen played a certain positive role in the asset verification, personnel arrangements, and production and operation during the joint operation of enterprises. Some industrialists and businessmen also took practical actions such as increasing enterprise investment, paying taxes, repaying outstanding debts of the enterprise, and repaying their own long-term advances in the enterprise to express their determination to accept transformation. It is particularly worth noting that on the basis of the original team of progressive core members in the industrial and commercial circles, a group of new core members have emerged, further strengthening the team of progressive core members in the industrial and commercial circles; they have played a leading, exemplary, and bridging role in the movement and made beneficial contributions to the socialist transformation. Family members and children of industrialists and businessmen also had many good and active performances in the transformation. At present, all private-sector personnel in substantive positions in the industrial and commercial circles of cities and counties in our province have been properly arranged under the care and consideration of the Party and the government, in accordance with the principle of assigning people according to their talents, and have received the support of the employees. They all believe that the country’s meticulous care is something they never thought of in the past, and unanimously expressed that they will further improve production and operation to repay the Party and the government. They are now actively participating in socialist emulation with the masses of employees and have made preliminary achievements.
    However, some industrialists and businessmen still have many concerns and uneasiness in their minds due to insufficient study, low awareness, and insufficient comprehensive understanding of government policies. For example, during the joint operation process, some capitalists even took the opportunity to withdraw funds and install private individuals. Some people also developed new erroneous thoughts after the joint operation: they haggled over the level of their positions, mistakenly regarding personnel arrangements as an opportunity to obtain personal fame and gain; some people became proud and detached from the masses after being arranged, causing disunity; some people believed that once the joint operation was completed, everything would be fine, and they could immediately remove the label of capitalists, thus generating negative emotions and simple dependence. They said: After the joint operation, there will be expenses at that time, and there will be an iron rice bowl, what am I afraid of. They also said that after the joint operation, there is the public side above and the trade union below, so just muddle along. There were even individual cases of collective embezzlement, extravagance, and waste after the joint operation. The above problems prove that the ideological remolding of the industrial and commercial circles is a long-term and arduous task, and the idea that the transformation is completed after the joint operation of enterprises is completely wrong.
    At the beginning of the joint operation, some industries and small shops in our province were not active enough in their operation, and even the service attitude of the employers was not cordial enough, resulting in a decline in sales. Later, after repeated education by the local Party and government and the federations of industry and commerce at all levels, there has been a rapid and universal change in the past one or two months, and the sales of various industries have been rising month by month, and a new and prosperous atmosphere has emerged everywhere. At present, the main problems still existing among industrialists and businessmen in our province are: some problems with the welfare benefits (i.e., medical expenses) for private-sector personnel in substantive positions after the joint operation, some capitalists have many family members and rely on personal income, and their lives are somewhat difficult, and some industrialists and businessmen still have debts and their assets cannot cover their debts, etc., which need to be actively addressed and gradually resolved, and we hope that the government will provide support and guidance.
    In order to adapt to the rapid development of the country’s socialist construction and socialist transformation, the current main task of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce at all levels in our province is to actively assist the government in doing a good job in the ideological remolding of capitalists. At present, great achievements have been made in the transformation of enterprises, but the ideological transformation of people is far behind the objective reality and must catch up. I would like to offer some immature suggestions on this:
    First, it is necessary to call on and encourage industrialists and businessmen to actively participate in the production and operation of their enterprises, strive to cultivate their labor habits and labor concepts, conscientiously learn skills, learn socialist enterprise management methods, and regularly check the shortcomings in their work, humbly listen to the criticisms of the masses, so that they can further understand the great wisdom of the working class and the truth that labor creates everything, and further clarify the blindness and backwardness of capitalist management and the irrationality of the capitalist system, thereby recognizing the glory of labor. Exercise, improve, and transform yourself in work and labor practice. This is the key to transforming oneself from an exploiter who does not work for a living into a self-reliant laborer. In particular, all private-sector personnel in substantive positions in our joint ventures should enthusiastically and actively participate in the socialist emulation. This is an opportunity for us to perform meritorious service in labor production, and it is also a good opportunity to transform ourselves.
    Our industrialists and businessmen must take the initiative to consciously accept the leadership of the public side and the supervision of the workers, ensure that they are conscientious and responsible, and work with all employees to further improve labor productivity and management level in the enterprise. That is to say, the Party and the government trust the industrialists and businessmen and place great expectations on them. We should be more active, overcome and prevent the negative dependence of shrinking back in production and operation, being afraid of this and that and not daring to take responsibility; establish a correct attitude, make persistent efforts, and contribute our talents to the great national construction cause with the spirit of being the masters of our own affairs.
    Second, it is necessary to extensively and deeply organize industrialists and businessmen to conduct regular studies, and more effectively transform themselves through this study. Recently, relevant departments in our province have made a comprehensive plan for the study of the industrial and commercial circles in our province in accordance with the instructions of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. This is a timely and necessary measure. Although the industrial and commercial circles have made certain achievements in learning in the past, the content of that learning was not systematic and specific enough, and the scope of learning was limited to some middle and upper-level industrialists and businessmen, while the vast number of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen have not yet been organized. In the future, we must change this situation, and conduct regular political theory studies in a planned and organized manner under a unified study plan, and push the study to a new stage.
    Industrialists and businessmen must actively participate in learning in the future, and must participate in short-term training courses, as well as in the current affairs and policy studies organized by the Federation of Industry and Commerce or joint ventures. In this way, private industrialists and businessmen can have the opportunity to study. At present, some industrialists and businessmen have already had the requirement to strengthen learning. This is understandable and can be satisfied. However, it should be pointed out that there are still many ideological obstacles to learning among some industrialists and businessmen. For example, some lack confidence in political theory learning, thinking that it is difficult to understand and learn; some think that they are cadres of the country, and the ideological remolding is almost complete, and they have generated complacency and relaxation, and are unwilling to participate in learning; some think that learning is good in joint ventures, and are unwilling to learn in the Federation of Industry and Commerce; some progressive core members in the industrial and commercial circles carry the burden of progress, are proud and complacent, and talk empty talk in learning, unwilling to connect with reality, etc., these should be corrected. We know that learning is for transforming our own thoughts, and industrialists and businessmen must pay attention to and work hard to learn, especially for political theory learning, we must study hard, not only be satisfied with memorizing the articles, but also understand its spiritual essence, and combine it with our own practice, so as to be consistent in words and deeds, and at the same time adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism, and boldly expose the shortcomings in our work in order to achieve our thorough transformation. Only in this way can we truly transform ourselves into glorious laborers who support themselves.
    Now, I have been appointed as the manager of the Harbin State-owned Food Industry Company. In terms of my work ability, I am very unqualified. But the Party and the people still give me such great honor and trust, which makes me deeply grateful to the Party and the people for their care for me. I can only repay the expectations of the Party and the people for me with practical actions in my future work. First of all, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the help of comrades, I must strive to strengthen learning, carry out self-transformation, resolutely eliminate my capitalist thoughts, establish socialist thoughts, develop labor habits, and quickly transform myself into a self-reliant laborer. Secondly, I must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, closely connect with the masses, overcome the shortcomings of not going deep into the lower levels in the past, not frequently understanding the true thoughts of industrialists and businessmen, and not promptly reporting work to the leaders, and strive to improve myself and better serve the people.
    Finally, let us, with full confidence and unswervingly, unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and strive for the victorious completion of the socialist construction and socialist transformation!

    搞好对资本家的思想改造工作
    ——刘佩芝代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告、廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明和彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。我们黑龙江省民建会和工商联各级组织，将进一步团结和动员全省工商业者，在党政的领导下，积极地以实际行动为实现国家预算和高级农业生产合作社示范章程、为全面提早和超额完成五年计划、特别是为继续彻底完成社会主义改造事业中所负担的各项任务而奋斗。
    随着农业合作化高潮的到来，全国私营工商业的社会主义改造工作，已进入了一个新的阶段。我省各市县的私营工商业改造工作，以空前的速度、壮阔的规模、健康的步伐，基本上实现了全行业的公私合营。这是一个伟大的胜利。这个胜利是由于伟大的中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛主席的正确领导，是由于中共黑龙江省委和省人民委员会及各地党政对工商业者不断的教育：工商业者思想觉悟得以提高，因而积极接受社会主义改造的结果。这个胜利也说明了国家对私营工商业进行和平改造的方针是完全正确的。广大工商业者只有接受改造，走社会主义道路才有光明前途。
    在这次改造运动高潮中，我省工商业者普遍受到了一次深刻而实际的社会主义教育，思想觉悟有显著的提高，特别是毛主席深入人心的指示，像太阳一样照亮了工商界前进的道路，使工商业者得到了无限的温暖和希望，明确了社会发展规律，认清了国家和自己的伟大前途，懂得了如何掌握自己命运，更加热爱祖国和积极接受改造，因而有许多工商业者不论在会议讨论中或者在报刊上，深刻地检讨自己过去剥削行为和错误思想，在工商界中开展了一次比较深刻的批评与自我批评，纷纷表示一定听毛主席的话，走社会主义道路，并以实际行动争取在改造中立功。许多工商业者在企业合营时以及合营后的清产核资、人事安排和生产经营中间，起了一定的积极作用。有的工商业者还自动地以增加企业投资，清缴税款，归还企业对外欠账以及还清自己在企业中的长支等实际行动，来表示他们接受改造的决心。特别值得重视的是在原有工商界进步核心分子队伍的基础上，又涌现出了一批新的核心分子，进一步壮大了工商界中的进步核心分子队伍；他们在运动中发挥了带头、示范和桥梁作用，为社会主义改造事业作出了有益的贡献。工商业者家属和子女在改造工作中，也有许多很好的积极表现。目前我省市县工商界所有私方实职人员都在党和政府的关怀与照顾下，按照量才使用的原则得到了适当的安排，并得到了职工的支持。他们对国家这样无微不至的照顾，都认为是过去从来没有想到过的，一致表示：要进一步搞好生产经营来报答党和政府。现在正与职工群众一起，积极参加社会主义竞赛，并已作出了初步成绩。
    但是，还有部分工商业者由于学习不够，觉悟不高，对政府政策还不够全面了解，在思想上仍然还存在着很多顾虑，动荡不安。譬如在合营过程中，甚至曾发生过个别资本家趁机抽走资金和安插私人等现象。也有的人在合营之后，又产生了新的错误思想：他们斤斤计较自己的职位高低，错误地把人事安排看成是获得个人名利地位的机会；有的人被安排后，便马上骄傲起来，脱离群众，闹不团结；有的人认为一经合营，就万事大吉，就可立即摘掉资本家的帽子，因而产生了消极情绪和单纯依赖思想。他们说：合营了，到时候开支，有了铁饭碗，我怕啥。又说什么合营后上有公方，下有工会，得过且过。甚至还有个别的合营后集体贪污，挥霍浪费等违法行为发生。上述问题证明工商界的思想改造工作，是一项长期的艰巨的工作，那种认为企业合营后就改造完毕的想法是完全错误的。
    我省工商业者在合营之初，曾出现过部分行业和小商店经营不够积极，甚至对于顾主的服务态度不够亲切，卖钱额下降的现象。后来经过当地党政和各级工商联反复教育，近一两个月以来普遍的迅速转变，各行各业的卖钱额都有不同的逐月上升，各地已出现欣欣向荣的新气象。目前，我省工商业者中还存在的主要问题是：合营后私方实职人员福利待遇（即医疗费）有些问题，部分资方家口多，依靠个人收入，生活有些困难，以及部分工商业者还有债权债务和产不抵债的情况等等，需要积极设法逐步解决，希望政府给予支持和指示。
    为了适应国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的迅速发展，我省民建会和工商联各级组织的当前主要任务，是积极协助政府搞好对资本家的思想改造工作。目前企业改造已取得了很大的成绩，但人的思想改造，还远远落后于客观实际，必须迎头赶上。个人对此提几点不成熟意见：
    一、要号召和鼓励工商业者积极参加本企业生产和经营，努力培养自己的劳动习惯、劳动观念，认真学习技能，学习社会主义的企业管理方法，并经常检查自己工作中的缺点，虚心地倾听群众的批评，使自己进一步了解工人阶级的伟大智慧及劳动创造一切的道理，进一步明确资本主义经营的盲目落后和资本主义制度的不合理，从而认识劳动光荣。在工作与劳动实践中锻炼，提高和改造自己。这是把自己从一个不劳而获的剥削者改造成为自食其力的劳动者的关键。特别是当前我们所有合营企业的私方实职人员，都应热烈地积极地投入社会主义竞赛里来。这是我们在劳动生产中立功的机会，也是改造自己的好机会。
    我们工商业者必须主动地自觉地接受公方领导和工人群众的监督，保证做到守职尽责，和全体职工一道为在本企业内进一步提高劳动生产率和经营管理水平而努力。也就是说，党和政府对工商业者是信任的，寄予很大期望的，我们应该更加积极起来，克服和防止在生产经营上缩手缩脚，怕这怕那不敢负责的消极依赖现象；树立正确态度，再接再厉，以当家作主的精神，来把自己的才能贡献给伟大的祖国建设事业。
    二、要广泛深入地组织工商业者进行正规的学习，通过这一学习更加有效地改造自己。最近我省有关部门已根据中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的指示，对我省工商界的学习问题进行了全面规划。这是一项适时的必要的措施。过去工商界在学习上虽然也有一定成绩，但是那种学习的内容还不够系统和具体，学习面仅限于部分中上层的工商业者，而广大中小工商业者还未组织起来。今后我们必须改变这种情况，在统一的学习规划下，有组织有计划地进行正规的政治理论学习，把学习推向一个新的阶段。
    工商业者今后必须积极参加学习，要参加短期讲习班，也要参加工商联或者合营企业所组织的时事和政策学习。这样私营工商业者都能获得学习的机会。目前有些工商业者已经有了加强学习的要求。这是可以理解的，而且可以得到满足的。但是应该指出，也还有些工商业者对学习存在着不少的思想障碍。如有的对政治理论学习缺乏信心，认为难懂不好学；有的认为自己是国家的干部了，思想改造差不多了，产生了自满松劲情绪，不愿参加学习；有的认为学习在合营企业学习好，不愿到工商联学习；也有的工商界核心分子背起进步包袱，骄傲自满，在学习中夸夸其谈，不愿联系实际，等等，这些都是应当纠正的。我们知道学习是为了改造自己思想，工商业者必须重视和努力学习，特别是对政治理论学习，要刻苦钻研，不能仅以背条文为满足，还要领会它的精神实质，并与自己的实践结合起来，作到言行一致，同时要采取批评与自我批评的方法，大胆地揭露自己在工作上所存在的缺点，以求自己的彻底改造。只有这样，才能够真正的把自己改造成为自食其力的光荣的劳动者。
    现在，我被任命为哈尔滨市国营食品工业公司经理。以我的工作能力来看，是很不称职的。但党和人民还给予我这么大的荣誉和信任，使我深深感谢党和人民对我的照顾。我只有在今后工作中以实际行动来报答党和人民对我的期待。首先，我要在党和政府的领导下，在同志们的帮助下，努力加强学习，进行自我改造，坚决消灭我的资本主义思想，树立社会主义思想，养成劳动习惯，迅速地把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。其次，我要戒骄戒躁，密切联系群众，克服过去不深入下层，不经常了解工商业者真实思想情况和不及时向领导反映工作情况的缺点，努力提高自己，更好的为人民服务。
    最后，让我们信心百倍地、坚定不移地紧密团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，为胜利地完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业而奋斗。
