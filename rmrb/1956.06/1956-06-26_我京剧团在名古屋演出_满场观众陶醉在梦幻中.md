Xinhua News Agency, Nagoya, June 24th: “Mei Lanfang’s youthful and graceful performance has entranced the entire audience in a dream.” This is the comment of today’s Nagoya “Mainichi Shimbun” on the performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe which began its public performance in Nagoya last night.

On the evening of June 23rd, more than 2,100 spectators crowded into the Nagoya City “Public Hall.” Among them were the Mayor of Nagoya, prominent figures from all walks of life in Nagoya, and an 82-year-old woman who had travelled from Mie Prefecture, more than 150 kilometers away from Nagoya. They were completely captivated by the performance of the Chinese artists.

After the performance, Katsuji Seiichi, President of Nagoya University, said: I have seen Peking Opera twice before in Tokyo and Beijing. I never expected to be able to see Peking Opera in Nagoya today, which makes me extremely happy! He said: In Peking Opera, one can see the common feelings of East Asians. He also said that the Peking Opera Troupe's visit to Japan for performances will play a significant role in enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. The Mayor of Nagoya, Kobayakawa Tachibana, said: This time, I deeply felt that Peking Opera is not only Chinese drama, but also a world-class art. At the end of the performance, representatives from the All-Aichi Prefecture Flower Cultivation Alliance, the "Asahi Shimbun" and others went on stage to present flowers to Mei Lanfang.

    据新华社名古屋24日电　“梅兰芳年青优美演技使满场观众陶醉在梦幻中了。”这是今天的名古屋“每日新闻”对昨天晚上在名古屋开始公演的中国京剧团的演出的评论。
    六月二十三日晚上，二千一百多观众挤满了名古屋市“公会堂”。其中有名古屋市长和名古屋各界名流，还有一位从远离名古屋一百五十多公里的三重县赶来的八十二岁的老太太。他们完全被中国艺术家的演出吸引住了。
    在演出结束以后，名古屋大学校长胜治精一说：从前曾经在东京和北京看过两次京剧，真想不到今天能够在名古屋看到京剧，这使我高兴极了！他说：在京剧里可以看到东亚人的共同感情。他并且说，京剧团前来日本访问演出，对于增进中日两国人民的互相理解和友谊将起很大的作用。名古屋市长小林橘川说：这一次我深深地感觉到京剧不仅是中国的戏剧，而是具有世界性的艺术。演出结束时，全爱知县栽花联盟、“朝日新闻”社代表等走上舞台向梅兰芳献花。
