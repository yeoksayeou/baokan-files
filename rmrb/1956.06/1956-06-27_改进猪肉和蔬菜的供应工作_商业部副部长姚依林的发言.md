Now I would like to express some opinions on several issues in commercial work.

First, I will talk about the supply of non-staple foods, especially pork and vegetables, which are of greatest concern to the people of the whole country.

The experience of Hunan in increasing pork production is worth paying attention to.

Currently, the pork supply is tight in many regions, except for a few provinces where it is relatively abundant. The reasons for the insufficient pork supply should first be examined from the perspective of production. In 1954, the national pork production was approximately 100 million head, which was the highest annual production level in history (63.68 million in 1937). In 1955, due to the severe floods of 1954 and the tight grain supply, pork production decreased to about 90 million head, and the weight of each pig also decreased significantly. In 1956, the estimated pork production is 120 million head. According to our investigation materials, it may be difficult to achieve this goal, but it may reach or slightly exceed the level of 1954. This is mainly because too many sows were slaughtered in the second half of the year before last and the first half of last year, resulting in insufficient piglets. In many places, the amount of feed reserved for pigs last year was calculated according to the number of pigs at the time of the grain "three fixings" (fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales), without including the newly added number. Some places also found the feed reserved for pigs to be too tight. In addition, the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives in pig farming is also an important factor in developing pork production. Wherever attention has been paid to the leadership of pig farming and effective measures have been taken to help cooperative members overcome difficulties in pig farming, the recovery and development of pork production has been faster. Wherever these effective measures have not been taken, the recovery of pork production has been slower, and even decreased in some places compared to last year. Hunan is a province where pork production has increased this year, with the Xiangtan Special District having the largest increase, not only in the number of heads but also in the weight of each pig compared to last year. This is primarily because the Provincial People's Committee, since March of this year, has called for "every cooperative to have sows and every township to have boars," emphasizing on-site breeding of piglets and promoting double mating and re-mating methods, which basically solved the problem of piglet shortages. Secondly, in the grain "three fixings," relatively sufficient feed was reserved for pig farmers. Many agricultural production cooperatives set aside some poor land to grow green fodder and distributed feed such as bean dregs, potato seedlings, and radish seedlings to cooperative members for pig farming. It should be noted that after agricultural cooperativization, many green fodder and roughage that farmers could use to feed pigs in the past now belong to the cooperative. If the cooperative does not pay attention to regularly distributing these feeds to cooperative members and encouraging them to collect wild feed to feed pigs as before, cooperative members will have difficulty in obtaining feed. It is not enough to rely solely on grain to feed pigs, and cooperative members cannot afford it either. Thirdly, agricultural production cooperatives have set reasonable prices for purchasing pig manure. According to surveys in many places in Hunan, a cooperative member can recover about 10 to 12 yuan in manure prices by raising a pig themselves, which is roughly equivalent to the cost of the concentrated feed required to feed the pig, so farmers can make money by raising pigs. Fourthly, some counties have established pig production management agencies to strengthen the leadership of pig production. For example, Wangcheng County (a newly established county near Changsha) in Hunan Province is one of the counties where pig production has recovered and developed the fastest. By the end of April 1956, the county had 142,000 pigs, an average of 1.5 pigs per household, which is almost double the number at the end of June last year. In this county, a livestock bureau consisting of 35 people was established, with production sections, epidemic prevention technology sections, and feed management sections. Each district has a pig production management unit, each agricultural production cooperative has a pig production team, and each production team has a deputy team leader specifically in charge of pig production. It is estimated that the total income from pig farming in Wangcheng County this year will reach about 10 million yuan, which is roughly equivalent to 40% of the total annual rice output of the county. Although this is only a local experience and may not be fully applicable to all parts of the country, it can generally be seen that as long as local party and government organs strengthen leadership, relevant departments work together, and make progress in all aspects, from developing piglets, improving feed supply, and strengthening production leadership, on the basis of this year's grain output being higher than last year, it is hopeful to actively develop pig production and thereby improve the pork supply situation next year.

Measures to alleviate the shortage of meat supply

Although the pork supply situation may improve from next year, many of the pigs that are gradually recovering and developing in various places this year are still small pigs and cannot be purchased and slaughtered. Since people's demand for meat has greatly increased due to the increase in purchasing power, the tight supply situation cannot be avoided for the time being, and may even become more tense than the current situation in a short period after wage increases for workers and the autumn harvest. Commercial departments should do everything possible to alleviate the current tight meat supply in urban and rural areas. The measures we have taken in this regard are: (1) Reduce pork exports by 50,000 tons. In recent years, China's pork exports, calculated in terms of frozen meat converted to live pigs, have generally been between 3.5 million and 4.8 million head, accounting for 3% to 4% of production and about 5.5% of slaughter volume. The export ratio is not large, but it can earn more foreign exchange, which is beneficial to supporting industrial construction. This year, due to the tight pork supply in the domestic market, we have agreed with the Ministry of Foreign Trade to reduce pork exports by 50,000 tons to increase the supply of 1.1 million live pigs in the domestic market, so that China's pork exports this year will remain at or slightly less than last year's export figures. (2) We have agreed with the Ministry of Food to allocate 1 billion jin of grain in the grain year from July 1956 to June 1957, so that the state can prepay a certain amount of grain when ordering live pigs from farmers in key production areas, in order to increase the feed in rural areas and enable the live pigs purchased by the state to grow fatter and produce more meat. (3) In some places, the purchase price of live pigs is slightly lower. This spring, it has been raised a little in some areas, and it is planned to raise it appropriately again to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for pig farming. It is estimated that farmers in places with low purchase prices will increase their income by nearly 40 million yuan in the second half of this year as a result. (4) Strive to improve business management, strengthen transfer and transportation work, and reduce waste and losses to increase the supply of meat in the market. The China Food Company, which belongs to the Ministry of Commerce, is a new company that was only established in January 1954. At the beginning of the establishment of the Food Company, due to the lack of experience in the acquisition, breeding, escort, slaughter and sale of live pigs, insufficient equipment, and poor business management, the loss and waste were very serious. In 1954, the mortality rate of live pigs operated by the Food Company reached 2.4% of the total operating volume. Not only was there no profit in the operation, but also a loss of 18.98 million yuan. In the first half of 1955, due to the experience of raising pigs in Changsha No. 1 Warehouse, each pig entering the warehouse was checked, body temperature was measured, and universally disinfected. Healthy pigs were separated according to size, strength and weakness, and placed in separate pens. Sick pigs were distinguished between infectious and non-infectious diseases, and isolated separately. The pig pens were kept clean and hygienic. According to seasonal climate conditions, combined with rural pig feeding habits, feed was specified, cooked food was fed, and timid, weak, and pigs that did not dare to eat were fed separately to ensure that each head was fed. This greatly reduced the mortality rate of pigs and quickly grew meat and gained weight, turning the loss of pig feeding into profitable pig feeding. Later, the experience of Comrade Wang Xicheng, a dispatcher of the Xuchang Food Company in Henan Province, who transported pigs on the train, and did not die a pig in more than 80 escorts of more than 8,000 pigs in two years, was found and promoted, so that the mortality rate of live pigs operated by the Food Company in 1955 was reduced to 0.68%. In addition to other improvements, the loss of money was changed to an accumulation of 31.31 million yuan. As a result of continuing to fully promote these experiences in 1956, it is estimated that the mortality rate may not exceed 0.3%. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work, the waste is still very serious, and there is still great potential in improving business management. For example, Sichuan is a place with a relatively large number of pigs produced in the country, but historically, live pigs in Sichuan have never been transported eastward by the Yangtze River. Since the second half of last year, after several trials, it has been able to transport live pigs eastward from Sichuan. In the first half of this year, 150,000 heads have been transported, and it is estimated that 350,000 heads may be transported this year, which can increase the supply of fresh meat in other regions. In addition, the Food Company has recently taken the improvement of processing enterprises as the center to promote the experience of manufacturing heads, hooves, and offal, and strives to make the heads, hooves, and offal processed and manufactured in a short period of time welcomed by consumers, and prepares to actively organize hatcheries to develop chicken raising near cities, develop duck raising in lake and swamp areas, and expand the operation of chickens and ducks to supply people's needs. It is estimated that after taking the above measures, the tightness of the market meat supply in the second half of this year may be somewhat alleviated, but to fundamentally improve the meat supply, it mainly depends on the growth of grain production and pig production.

Vegetable supply and price issues

Whether the production and sales of vegetables are adapted and whether the price can be stabilized is also an important issue in the supply of non-staple foods. The vegetables in the countryside are self-sufficient, and small cities and market towns are close to the countryside, so they can get vegetable supplies from the countryside, and the problem is not big. Those who are concerned about the supply of vegetables are mainly the people in major and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas across the country. In recent years, the prices of major non-staple foods across the country have been rising. Taking the retail price in 1952 as 100, in 1955, pork was 127; edible oil was 120; eggs were 133. There are two main reasons for the increase. One reason is that the price of grain increased in 1953, which caused the prices of various non-staple foods centered on grain to rise; the other reason is that the increase in the purchasing power of the people across the country has made these non-staple foods themselves in short supply. Taking the national consumption in 1952 as 100, then, in 1955, the national consumption of pork was 133; the consumption of eggs was 138; the consumption of edible oil was 134. The increase in people's demand for these non-staple foods has exceeded the growth rate of the production of these non-staple foods. Commercial departments have not done a good job in the supply of non-staple foods, which is also an important reason why the prices of non-staple foods have not been stabilized in recent years. However, in the supply of vegetables, there are some differences from pork, eggs, and edible oil. Before 1954, the prices of vegetables in major and medium-sized cities across the country were constantly rising, and the situation of supply falling short of demand was very serious. 1953 was the year with the highest vegetable prices in major and medium-sized cities across the country, an increase of 48% compared to 1951. After 1954, vegetable prices gradually stabilized or decreased. The vegetable prices in 1955 decreased somewhat compared to 1953, but were still 26% higher than in 1951. At present, the rise in vegetable prices is mainly in new industrial and mining areas, where the quantity cannot meet the supply and the variety is insufficient. Vegetables are a perishable commodity, and most varieties are not suitable for long-distance transportation. They can only be produced near the city by organizing agricultural production cooperatives and sold locally. The reason why the supply of vegetables in major and medium-sized cities has increased in the past two years is mainly due to the fact that the local and nearby county party and government organs have organized farmers to expand the vegetable planting area and increase the harvest per mu. According to statistics from more than 30 large and medium-sized cities across the country, the vegetable cultivated area in 1955 was 1.25 million mu, which increased to 1.6 million mu in 1956. The replanting area in 1955 was 2.3 million mu, which increased to 3.12 million mu in 1956. The commodity vegetables in 1955 were 56.85 million dan, and it is estimated that it will reach 85.4 million dan in 1956. For each urban population, 8.8 liang of vegetables can be supplied per day last year, and 11 liang of vegetables can be supplied per day this year. Therefore, we estimate that in major and medium-sized cities, there will generally be no shortage of vegetables or rising vegetable prices due to the increase in people's purchasing power, but shortages and price fluctuations due to seasonal changes or temporary supply and demand imbalances of certain varieties will still exist. In the new industrial and mining areas, due to the shortcomings in the work of the commercial departments, insufficient attention has been paid to the local vegetable supply, and it has not been possible to promptly suggest that local party and government organs and nearby rural areas expand the vegetable planting area, or timely organize long-distance adjustments, so that vegetables are still in short supply. We should pay attention to this in the future and cooperate closely with the industrial and mining departments in order to solve the vegetable supply problem in the new industrial and mining areas as soon as possible. The large-scale operation of vegetables by national state-owned commercial departments in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas only began after the public-private partnership of the entire industry. The China Vegetable Company, which belongs to the Ministry of Commerce, was established at the end of last year. Now we have organized vegetable merchants and hawkers in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas, and have taken over the vegetable business originally operated by supply and marketing cooperatives, and have organized state-owned vegetable companies in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas to start统筹 the wholesale and retail of vegetables. But we still lack knowledge and experience in this work and need to study seriously. At present, there are many serious problems in the operation of vegetables in various places. For example, in many places, there is a disconnection between the production and sales links, the quality of vegetables is declining, and the backlog and rot in the season when vegetables are on the market in large quantities are serious. Various places have not yet created a set of effective methods for organizing the source of goods, organizing distribution, grading and evaluation, processing, transportation and storage in large-scale operations. Must study and improve. In addition, in the northern provinces, there is generally a shortage of vegetables in winter and spring. Except for radishes and Chinese cabbage, other fresh vegetables mainly rely on greenhouses for supply, the quantity is very small, and the price is very expensive. In order to find ways to solve this problem, with the support of the Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City Party and government and the Ministry of Railways, the China Vegetable Company has been trying to transport fresh vegetables from Guangdong to the north since April 16 this year. A total of more than 80 refrigerated cars were transported to Beijing, Harbin, Changchun, Fushun, Lanzhou, Shenyang, Tianjin, Jilin and other places. A total of more than a dozen varieties were shipped. The result of the trial transportation is that, except for leafy vegetables that are not suitable for transportation, melon and vegetable types can generally maintain fresh quality, and the loss only accounts for about 6%, and the cost and selling price are half or even more lower than local greenhouse vegetables. We plan to transport tens of thousands of tons of fresh vegetables from Guangdong to the north this winter and next spring, first of all, to adjust the industrial and mining areas. In addition, the grain used for processing vegetables this year is generally felt to be insufficient, especially in many places it is not easy to buy tofu, bean sprouts and vermicelli, which is unsatisfactory to urban and rural people. We have repeatedly discussed with the Ministry of Grain, because soybeans and mung beans were reduced in production last year, and the current stock is very small, it will be possible to increase after the new grain is on the market this year.

Most of the non-staple foods are fresh and perishable commodities, which are very seasonal in production and generally relatively balanced in consumption, but also have a certain seasonality. When fattening pigs are raised, hens lay eggs, and fishing seasons arrive, they must be purchased in large quantities, but consumers often cannot consume them in time, causing losses. When consumers need a lot, such as during the New Year and festivals, they are often not supplied, causing shortages. This contradiction between the production season and the consumption season is particularly significant in the operation of non-staple foods. The way to solve this contradiction is to rely on processing and refrigeration, in addition to adjusting with seasonal price differences within a certain range. In recent years, the state has given some appropriations in this regard. Now we have built warehouses that can raise 1 million live pigs, and have built three meat processing and refrigeration factories in Hailar, Zhengzhou, and Changsha. We are now building and expanding processing plants and refrigeration warehouses in eleven cities including Wuhan and Chongqing, and building Beijing cold storage. However, in ensuring exports and adjusting the domestic market supply, the basic construction that has been started and completed is still insufficient, especially in the new industrial and mining areas, not only lacking necessary storage equipment, but also lacking business premises and employee dormitories. We believe that it is necessary to further expand non-staple food processing equipment, refrigeration equipment, and expand business premises and employee dormitories in new industrial and mining areas.

Improve the allocation and distribution of industrial products

In the allocation and distribution of industrial products, although the commercial departments have gradually improved in the past few years, there are still many shortcomings and errors. Some goods are not allocated in a timely manner, the varieties are not right, and the situation of backlog in one place and shortage in another place exists. People have many criticisms of us in this regard, which should be accepted, and we fully accept these criticisms. The commercial plan was not completed in 1955, which is also one of the reasons. In improving these shortcomings and errors, we have conceived hard work methods and explored some typical experiences. We believe that after the public-private partnership of the entire industry, better conditions have been obtained to gradually improve the current situation. First, we plan to start from the second half of this year to implement a system in which the sales unit can completely freely choose the variety of flowers and colors within the scope of the planned indicators between the wholesale stations in the commercial department, between the wholesale unit and the retail unit, and strictly prohibit the practice of matching good goods with bad goods. The Taiyuan public-private partnership "Lianyi" small department store wholesale store, which is jointly organized by 17 merchants and 4 seat merchants, adopts this method. They have two purchasers stationed in Shanghai, responsible for the selection and purchase of goods in the Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Changzhou areas, and one person stationed in Beijing is also responsible for the selection and purchase of goods in Tianjin. They adopt a communication contact method to purchase goods from Boshan, Shandong, and sometimes send people to go there. Communicate every day, exchange market information, and often try out new varieties. After adopting this method of purchasing goods, the commodities they operate have expanded nearly four times, and the turnover has increased by six times. We believe that this method of selection and purchase is generally applicable to industrial products with very complex patterns and varieties such as daily necessities, knitwear, and cultural supplies. It is much better than the system of allocating goods from top to bottom and matching good and bad. This was originally the old method of commerce in our country. In the past, due to the expansion of the wholesale base of state-owned commerce, the strengthening of market management, and the prevention of speculative activities, it was not appropriate to adopt this method. Now that capitalist commerce has been fully converted into public-private partnership, there are conditions for implementing this method within a certain range of planned indicators and within the socialist or public-private partnership commerce between a part of the range of goods with very complex patterns and varieties. After adopting this method, inferior goods that everyone is unwilling to choose can be sold at a properly reduced price and must not be forcibly matched. For some goods with particularly good quality, a premium price should be implemented for premium goods. Doing so may reduce some national accumulation in some commodities, but it is beneficial in improving the work of commercial departments and overcoming the shortcomings of untimely and inappropriate commodities, and it is also beneficial in reducing the roundabout allocation of commodities and strengthening direct transportation. Secondly, we have discussed with the industrial departments and plan to adopt a contract between the industrial departments and the commercial departments within the scope of commodities where the state can use plans to control production varieties and quantities, so that the delivery figures of the industrial departments and the procurement figures of the commercial departments are linked, basically unchanged for one year. The advantage of this to the industrial departments is that they can stably carry out production and reduce the phenomenon of insufficient start-up tasks in the off-season and overtime work in the peak season, thereby promoting the planning of industrial production. The advantage to the commercial departments is that this system can also be implemented simultaneously between the wholesale units of the commercial departments, so that the commercial departments at all levels can seriously analyze the operating situation and investigate people's needs. In the early stage of implementing this system, the phenomenon of commodity backlog and shortage is inevitable, but if it is insisted on for two or three years, it will strengthen the planning of both industry and commerce, make the commercial departments more familiar with the needs of the people, and in the final analysis, it is still beneficial to consumers. Third, we have discussed with the industrial departments and plan to gradually implement the method of factories guaranteeing returns and exchanges for products leaving the factory under certain conditions. This is also an old method in the industry and commerce of our country. In the past, many capitalist industries, in order to maintain their trademarks and reputation, have always guaranteed returns and exchanges for unqualified products leaving the factory. The implementation of this method prevents consumers from buying inferior goods, and it is also of great benefit in protecting the interests of consumers. At the same time, it can also be considered that in factories that implement this method, the industrial departments can gradually be solely responsible for inspecting products leaving the factory, and the commercial departments do not have to carry out inspections. As for the issue of profit distribution between industrial and commercial departments, many of these issues are issues left over from processing and ordering goods before the public-private partnership, and a small part occurred after the public-private partnership. We assume that if the Ministry of Finance implements the system of levying most of the profits of industrial and commercial enterprises in the form of a single tax a little earlier, this problem can be easily solved.

    改进猪肉和蔬菜的供应工作  
    ——商业部副部长姚依林的发言
    现在我就商业工作中的几个问题，发表一点意见。
    首先，我讲一下全国人民所最关心的副食品，特别是猪肉和蔬菜的供应问题。湖南生猪增产的经验值得重视
    目前猪肉的供应，除了少数省份比较宽裕外，在许多地区是紧张的。猪肉供应不足的原因，首先要从生产上来加以考察。1954年全国的生猪产量约计一亿头，这是历史上最高的年产水平（1937年为6，368万头）。1955年，由于1954年的大水灾和粮食供应的紧张，生猪产量降低到9，000万头左右，每头猪的重量也降低很大。1956年，生猪的预计产量是12，000万头，根据我们的调查材料来估计，恐怕难于达到这个目标，但可能达到或略高于1954年的水平。这主要是由于前年下半年和去年上半年母猪宰杀过多，猪秧不足，去年生猪的饲料留量在不少地方是按照粮食“三定”当时的养猪头数计算的，没有把新增加的头数计算在内，有些地方对生猪的饲料留量还嫌偏紧。此外，农业生产合作社对养猪的领导，也是发展生猪生产的一个重要因素，大凡注意了养猪工作的领导，采取了有效的措施来帮助社员克服养猪困难的地方，生猪的恢复和发展就较快，凡是没有采取这些有效措施的地方，生猪的恢复就较慢，甚至有的地方比去年还有所减少。湖南是今年生猪增产的一个省份，其中以湘潭专区增产最大，不仅头数增加，而且每头猪的重量也比去年有所增加。这首先是由于省人民委员会从今年三月起就提出了“社社有母猪、乡乡有公猪”的号召，强调就地繁殖猪秧，提倡双重配种和复配的办法，基本上解决了猪秧的困难。其次，是在粮食“三定”中对养猪户留了比较充足的饲料，不少农业生产合作社留下了一些坏地种植青饲料，并分配了豆渣、洋芋苗、萝卜苗等饲料供给社员养猪。应该看到，在农业合作化以后，农民从前可以用来喂猪的不少青饲料和粗饲料现在都归了社，如果合作社不注意经常把这些饲料分配给社员，并鼓励社员同过去一样采集野生饲料喂猪，社员在饲料上是会发生困难的，只靠粮食来喂猪是不够的，而且社员也买不起的。第三是农业生产社规定了较合理的价格来收购猪粪，据湖南不少地方的调查，社员自养一头猪，大约可以收回粪价10元至12元左右，大体相当于喂猪所需的精饲料的成本，这样农民喂猪就可以赚钱了。第四是部分县成立了生猪生产管理机构，加强对生猪生产的领导。例如湖南省望城县（长沙附近的一个新设县）是生猪生产恢复和发展得最快的一个县。1956年四月末全县养猪数已达142，000头，平均每户一头半，比去年六月末增加了将近一倍，在这个县里就成立了一个由35人组成的畜牧局，设立了生产科，防疫技术科，饲料管理科等机构，每区都设了生猪生产管理股，每个农业生产合作社都设立了生猪生产股，每个生产队都有专管生猪生产的副队长。据估计，今年望城全县养猪的收益，将达到1，000万元左右，大约等于全县全年稻谷总产值的40％。虽然这只是一个地方的经验，在全国各地未必完全适用，但大体上可以看出，只要各地党政机关加强领导，有关部门共同努力，从发展猪秧，改善饲料供应，加强生产领导等各方面齐头并进，在今年粮食产量将较去年有所提高的基础上，积极发展生猪生产，从而改善明年的猪肉的供应状况，是有希望的。缓和肉类供应紧张程度的办法
    虽然从明年来看，生猪的供应情况可能有所改善，但在今年下半年，由于各地逐步恢复发展的生猪，有不少还是小猪，还不能收购、宰杀。由于人民对肉类的需要量，已经因为购买力的提高而大有增加，因而供应的紧张情况，暂时还不能避免，甚至在增加了工人工资和秋收登场之后，在一个短时期内，还有可能比现在的情况更加紧张一些。商业部门应当尽一切可能来缓和目前城乡肉类供应的紧张程度。在这方面我们采取的办法是，（一）减少5万吨猪肉出口。近年来我国猪肉的出口量，如以冻肉折合生猪计算，一般在350万头至480万头之间，出口量占生产量的3％至4％，占宰杀量的5.5％左右，出口比例不大，但可以换来较多的外汇，对支援工业建设是有利的。今年由于国内市场猪肉供应紧张，我们已商得对外贸易部的同意，减少出口猪肉5万吨以增加国内市场110万口生猪的供应量，这样就使我国今年的猪肉出口量仍然保持并略少于去年的出口数字。（二）我们已经商得粮食部同意，在由1956年7月至1957年6月的粮食年度中，拨给粮食10亿斤，使国家在重点产区向农民订购生猪时，能预付一定数量的粮食，以增加乡村的饲料，并使国家收购的生猪能够长得更肥，出肉更多，（三）在某些地方，生猪收购价格偏低了一些，今年春天在部分地区已经提高了一点，还准备再适当提高一点，以鼓励农民养猪的积极性。估计今年下半年，收购价偏低的地方的农民，将因此而增加近4，000万元的收入。（四）力求改善经营管理，加强调运工作，减少浪费和损失，来增加市场的肉类供应量。商业部所属的中国食品公司，是在1954年1月方才成立的一个新的公司，在食品公司成立之初，由于缺乏对生猪的收购、饲养、押运、屠宰和销售的经验，设备不足，经营管理不善，损失浪费十分严重。1954年食品公司经营的生猪，死亡率达到全部经营量的2.4％，经营中不仅没有利润，而且亏损了1，898万元。1955年上半年，由于开始推广了长沙第一仓库养猪的经验，对进仓库的猪进行逐头检查，测量体温，普遍消毒，把健康猪区别大小强弱，分别关在栏内，把病猪区分传染病和非传染病，分别隔离，经常保持猪栏的清洁卫生，根据季节气候情况，结合农村喂猪习惯，规定饲料，喂熟食，对胆小的、体弱的、不敢吃食的猪分别喂养，保证头头喂饱，这样就使得猪的死亡率大大降低，很快长肉增重，从喂猪赔本变成喂猪有利。后来又找到了河南许昌食品公司押运员王喜成同志在火车上运猪，做到两年80多次押运8，000多头猪中不死一头猪的经验，加以推广，因而使1955年食品公司经营生猪的死亡率降低到0.68％，加上其他方面的改进，由赔钱变成有3，131万元的积累。1956年继续全面推广这些经验的结果，估计可能达到死亡率不超过0.3％。但是我们工作中的缺点仍然很多，浪费还很严重，在改善经营管理上，还有巨大的潜力。例如四川是一个全国产猪较多的地方，但历史上四川的活猪从未经长江东运。从去年下半年起，经过几次试验后，现在已能由四川东运活猪了，今年上半年已经运了15万头，估计今年可能运出35万头，这样就可以增加其他地区的鲜肉供应。此外，食品公司最近又以改进加工企业为中心，推广制造头、蹄、下水的经验，争取做到在短时期内，经过加工制造的头、蹄、下水，能为消费者所欢迎，并准备积极组织孵卵坊，在城市附近发展养鸡，在湖沼地区发展养鸭，扩大对鸡鸭的经营，以供应人民需要。估计在采取了以上这些措施以后，今年下半年市场肉类供应的紧张程度，可能会有些减轻，但从根本上改进肉类供应工作，主要还是要靠粮食生产和生猪生产的增长。蔬菜的供应和价格问题
    蔬菜的产销是否适应，价格能否稳定，也是副食品供应的一个重要问题。乡村的蔬菜是自给的，小城市和集镇由于接近乡村，可以由乡村得到蔬菜供应，问题也不大。关心蔬菜供应的，主要是全国各大中城市和工矿区的人民。近年以来，全国主要副食品的价格是上涨的，全国各大城市如以1952年的零售价格为100，1955年猪肉为127；食油为120；鸡蛋为133。上涨的原
  因主要有两个，一个原因是由于1953年粮食价格提高了，使得以粮食为中心的各项副食品的价格随同上涨；另一个原因是由于全国人民购买力的提高，使这些副食品本身也处于供不应求的情况。如以1952年的全国消费量为100，那末，1955年全国猪肉的消费量为133；鸡蛋的消费量为138；食油的消费量为134。人民对这些副食品的需求增长的幅度，超过了这些副食品生产增长的速度。商业部门对副食品的供应工作还做得不好，也是使近年来副食品价格尚不能趋于稳定的一个重要原因。但是在蔬菜供应上，却与猪肉、鸡蛋、食油有一些不同的情况。在1954年以前，全国各大、
  中城市的蔬菜价格是不断上涨的，供不应求的情况很严重。1953年是全国各大、中城市蔬菜价格最高的一年，比1951年上涨了48％。1954年以后，蔬菜价格逐步稳定或下降，1955年的蔬菜价格比1953年降低了一些，但仍高于1951年26％。目前蔬菜价格上涨，主要是在新工矿区，数量上不能满足供应，品种上不敷需要。蔬菜是一种易于腐烂的商品，其中多数品种不适宜于远距离调运，只能在城市附近，组织农业生产合作社进行生产，就地推销。近两年来各大、中城市蔬菜供应量比较以前有所增加的原因，主要是由于当地和附近各县的党政机关组织农民扩大了蔬菜种植面积和提高了每亩的收获量。据全国30多个大、中城市的统计，1955年的蔬菜耕地面积是125万亩，1956年增加到160万亩，1955年的复种面积是230万亩，1956年增加到312万亩，1955年的商品菜是5，685万担，1956年预计将达到8，540万担。对每个城市人口，去年每天可以供应8.8两菜，今年每天可以供应11两菜，因此，我们估计，在各大、中城市，一般不会因为人民购买力增长而发生蔬菜脱销或蔬菜涨价的情况，但由于季节的变化或某些品种一时的供求脱节而发生的脱销和价格涨落，则仍然是会存在的。在新工矿区方面，由于商业部门在工作上存在着缺点，对当地的蔬菜供应工作注意不够，未能及时建议当地党政机关和附近农村扩大蔬菜种植面积，或及时组织远距离调剂，以致蔬菜仍然不敷供应，我们今后应当注意并与工矿部门密切合作，以求早日解决新工矿区的蔬菜供应问题。全国国营商业部门在大、中城市和工矿区大规模地经营蔬菜是在全行业公私合营后方才开始的，商业部所属的中国蔬菜公司，是在去年年底成立的，现在我们已经把大、中城市和工矿区的菜商菜贩组织起来，并接收了原来供销合作社经营的蔬菜业务，在各大、中城市和工矿区组织了国营蔬菜公司，开始统筹蔬菜的批发和零售。但对于这项工作，我们还十分缺乏知识和经验，需要认真学习。目前各地蔬菜经营中存在着许多严重的问题，例如在不少地方，生产环节和销售环节之间是有脱节现象的，蔬菜的品质是下降的，在蔬菜大量上市季节的积压和腐烂是严重的，各地在组织货源、组织分配、分等评价、加工、运输和保管上都还没有创造出一套在大量经营时行之有效的办法。必须研究、改进。此外，在北方各省，冬、春季一般是缺菜的，除了萝卜、白菜等外，其他新鲜蔬菜主要依靠温室来供应，数量很少，价钱很贵。为了设法解决这个问题，中国蔬菜公司在广东省、广州市党政和铁道部的支持之下，从今年四月十六日起，试办了将广东新鲜蔬菜北运的工作，一共运了80多个冷藏车，运到北京、哈尔滨、长春、抚顺、兰州、沈阳、天津、吉林等地，发运的品种共有十几种。试运的结果，除了叶菜不宜于运输外，瓜菜类一般都能保持新鲜的质量，而且损耗只占6％左右，成本和售价比当地温室蔬菜低到一半甚至低得更多。我们打算今冬明春由广东北运鲜菜数万吨，首先是调剂工矿区。此外，今年作为加工蔬菜之用的粮食一般感到不足，特别是有许多地方不容易买到豆腐、豆芽和粉丝，这是城乡人民所不满意的。我们曾经和粮食部反复商量过，由于大豆和绿豆去年是减产的，目前存量很少，要到今年新粮上市后，才有可能增加。
    副食品绝大部分都是鲜活商品，易于腐烂，在生产上季节性很大，在消费上一般比较平衡，但是也有一定的季节性。当肥猪育成、母鸡下蛋、鱼汛到来的时候，必须大量收购，但消费者又往往不能及时消费掉，造成损失。当消费者大量需要的时候，例如过年过节的时候，又往往供应不上，造成脱销。这种生产季节与消费季节之间的矛盾，在副食品经营上表现得特别显著。解决这个矛盾的办法，除了在一定范围之内用季节差价来调节以外，主要要依靠加工和冷藏。近几年来，国家在这方面给了一些拨款，现在我们已经建设了可以饲养100万头活猪的仓库，已经建成了海拉尔、郑州、长沙三个肉类加工和冷藏工厂，现在正在新建和扩建武汉、重庆等十一个城市的加工厂和冷藏库，新建北京冷库。但是在保证出口和调节国内市场供应上，目前已经开工和完成了的这些基本建设仍然不足，尤其在新工矿区方面，不仅缺乏必要的储藏设备，而且十分缺乏营业场所和职工宿舍。我们认为进一步扩充副食品加工设备，冷藏设备，扩建新工矿区的营业场所和职工宿舍是必要的。改进工业品的调拨和分配
    商业部门在工业品调拨和分配方面，几年来虽然逐步有些改善，但缺点和错误还很多，有些商品调拨不及时，品种不对路，此处积压，彼处脱销的情况是存在的，人民在这方面对我们有许多批评是应该的，我们完全接受这些批评。1955年商业计划没有完成，这也是原因之一。在改进这些缺点和错误方面，我们曾经设想过苦干办法，并摸索过一些典型经验，我们认为在全行业公私合营之后，已经取得了更好的条件来逐步改善目前的状况。首先，我们打算从今年下半年开始，在商业部门各批发站之间，在批发单位和零售单位之间，在计划指标范围内实行由销货单位完全自由选择花色品种的制度，严格禁止好货搭配坏货的做法。由十七户行商和四户座商联合组织起来的太原公私合营“联一”小百货批发店就是采取这种做法的，他们有两个采购员驻在上海，负责对上海、苏州、杭州、常州一带的选货、进货工作，有一个人驻在北京同时负责天津的选货、进货工作，对山东博山方面则采取通信联络的办法进货，有时也派人去一趟。每天通信，交流市场情况，并经常试销新品种。在采取了这种进货方法以后，他们经营的商品扩大了近四倍，营业额增加了6倍。我们认为这种选购的办法，在日用百货、针织品、文化用品等花色品种十分复杂的工业品方面一般是适用的，它比由上而下逐级调拨商品好坏搭配的制度要好得多。这本来是我国商业旧有的办法，过去由于扩大国营商业的批发阵地，加强市场管理，防止投机活动，不宜于采用这种办法。现在资本主义商业已经全行业公私合营了，因而在一定的计划指标的控制下，在一部分花色品种十分复杂的商品的范围内，在社会主义的或公私合营的商业内部之间，已经存在了实行这种办法的条件了。采取这种办法以后，凡是大家不愿选购的次货，可以适当地降价出售，不得强制搭配，对于一部分质量特别好的货物，应当实行优级优价。这样做，在某些商品方面可能减少一些国家积累，但在提高商业部门的工作，克服商品不及时、
  不对路的缺点方面，则是有利的，在减少商品的迂回调拨，加强直达运输方面，也是有利的。其次，我们已经和工业部门商量，在国家可以用计划来控制生产品种和数量的商品的范围内，打算采取由工业部门与商业部门订定合同，做到工业部门的交货数字和商业部门的采购数字相衔接，基本上一年不变。这样对工业部门的好处，是可以稳定地进行生产，减少淡季开工任务不足，旺季加班加点的现象，从而促进工业生产的计划性。对商业部门的好处，是在商业部门各批发单位之间，也可以同时实行这种制度，使得各级商业部门，认真的去分析经营情况，调查人民需要。在实行这项制度的初期，难免会发生商品的积压与脱销现象，但如果坚持实行两三年，将会加强工业与商业两方面的计划性，使商业部门更加熟悉人民的需要，归根到底，还是对消费者有利的。第三、我们已经和工业部门商量在可能的范围内，逐步实行在一定条件下，工厂对出厂商品包退包换的办法。这也是一项我国工商业中旧有的办法。过去有不少资本主义工业，为了维持自己的商标和信誉，对于出厂的不合格商品，向来是包退包换的。实行这种办法，使消费者不致买到坏货，在保护消费者的利益上，也有很大的好处。同时还可以考虑，在实行这种办法的工厂中，可以逐步做到由工业部门单独负责检验出厂商品，商业部门就不必进行检验了。至于工商部门之间的利润分配问题，其中有不少问题是公私合营以前在加工订货中遗留下来的问题，也有一小部分是在公私合营以后所发生的，我们设想，如果财政部早一点实行把工商企业的大部分利润改用单一的税收的形式加以征收的制度，这个问题是很容易解决的。（二、三、五、六版发言的标题和插题都是本报编者加的）
