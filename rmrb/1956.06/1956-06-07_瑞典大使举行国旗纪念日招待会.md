Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: Premier Zhou Enlai toasted at the reception held this afternoon by the Swedish Ambassador to China, Mr. Book, congratulating the Kingdom of Sweden on its prosperity and its people on their happiness. He also wished the King of Sweden good health.

The reception celebrating Swedish National Flag Day was held in the courtyard of the embassy. The national flags of China and Sweden were flying here.

Before Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass, Ambassador Book invited his one hundred-plus Chinese and foreign guests to join him in a toast to the happiness of the Chinese people and the good health of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China.

In the center of the courtyard was a clear pool with many goldfish. People drank and conversed around the fish pond.

The Swedish Ambassador told Premier Zhou Enlai that he had read the statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry regarding the United Nations Command's refusal to convene a meeting of relevant countries to discuss the Korean question. He said he was pleased with the position taken by the Chinese government on this issue. At this time, the Swiss Ambassador and the Chargé d'Affaires of Poland and Czechoslovakia also joined the conversation. Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, expressed gratitude to the governments and peoples of these four countries for their efforts in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, and toasted with the ambassadors and Chargé d'Affaires of these four countries.

The Swedish and Swiss Ambassadors to China told Premier Zhou Enlai that their countries were willing to continue working on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea. Premier Zhou Enlai said that we are very pleased and grateful.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke with the ambassadors of Switzerland and Finland and the minister of Denmark about the friendly exchanges between China and these countries. The Finnish Ambassador said that a delegation from the Finnish Parliament would arrive in China on the 21st or 22nd of this month, and we are the first country to send a parliamentary delegation to visit China. Premier Zhou Enlai said with a smile, no, it should be said that this is the first country that has established diplomatic relations with China to send a parliamentary delegation to visit China, because a delegation of members of the Japanese Diet has already visited China. The Danish Minister said that a Chinese agricultural study group would soon go to Denmark to study agriculture. He said that he had received a telegram from the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, and the Danish government had drawn up a large study plan for the study group. Premier Zhou Enlai said that friendly exchanges between countries would enhance mutual understanding and friendship.

The reception lasted for an hour and a half.

    庭院中心一座清澈的水池里有许多金鱼。人们就在鱼池的周围饮酒交谈。
    瑞典大使向周恩来总理表示，他读到了中国外交部就联合国军方面拒绝召开讨论朝鲜问题的有关国家会议发表的声明。他说，他对中国政府对这个问题所采取的立场表示高兴。这时，瑞士大使和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的临时代办也参加了谈话。周恩来总理代表中国政府和中国人民对这四个国家的政府和人民在朝鲜中立国监察委员会中所作的努力，表示感谢，并同这四个国家的大使和临时代办一起干杯。
