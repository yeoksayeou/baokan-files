Some institutions of higher education that are running spare-time higher education programs this year will conduct separate enrollment from after the national unified college entrance examination until October 1st. Majors starting in the spring semester will enroll during the winter vacation.

The night schools and correspondence education programs run by institutions of higher education this year are divided into three types: undergraduate, associate degree, and special classes. The Ministry of Higher Education stipulates that cadres and workers from factories, various cooperatives, government agencies, enterprises, military units, schools, and people's organizations, who have graduated from senior high school or secondary vocational schools or have equivalent academic ability and are healthy enough to persist in their studies, can apply for undergraduate programs at spare-time institutions of higher education. Those applying for engineering associate degree programs at spare-time institutions of higher education must have previously graduated from higher education specialty courses or graduated early from the third year of undergraduate programs; those applying for liberal arts associate degree programs must have graduated from senior high school or have equivalent academic ability. Special classes mainly enroll transferred cadres or leading cadres above the section chief level promoted from workers and farmers who have a junior high school education or equivalent to a senior high school level.

The Ministry of Higher Education also stipulates that those applying for majors in engineering, agriculture, forestry, finance and economics, and politics and law should choose their majors based on the principle of "doing what you do, learning what you do" and in conjunction with the nature of their current work.

    高等教育部还规定报考工、农、林、财经、政法等科的人，要根据“做什么、学什么”的原则，结合现任工作的性质选择报考专业。（新华社）
