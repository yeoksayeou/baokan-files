Comrades, Friends, and Dalai Lama:

    The Central Delegation is about to leave Tibet today and return to Beijing. During our time in Tibet, we received a warm reception from the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, the CCP Tibet Working Committee, the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, and the monastic and secular officials and people of Tibet. This enabled us to successfully complete the task assigned to us by the Central Government and Chairman Mao of celebrating the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Here, I would like to express my deep gratitude on behalf of all the comrades of the Central Delegation to all comrades and friends, and through you, to all the people of Tibet.
    The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is a major event in the history of Tibet and a major event in the history of our motherland. It conforms to the democratic aspirations of the broad masses of the people and opens up a smooth path for the development of Tibet. Here, I once again congratulate the people of Tibet on their achievements.
    During its stay in Tibet, the Central Delegation also visited and expressed its regards to the monastic and secular people and the stationed troops in various parts of Tibet, visited schools, hospitals, temples, farms, and factories, and exchanged views with the leaders and officials of Tibet on gradually carrying out democratic reforms and building Tibet. In our extensive contact with the leaders, officials, and people of Tibet, we saw and learned many valuable things. Although the time we spent together was short, we have established a deep friendship, and our unity has been further strengthened. We are in complete agreement on the great goal of carrying out socialist construction in the motherland and Tibet, and we are also in complete agreement on maintaining the great unity of all ethnic groups in the motherland. With this great spirit of unity, we can overcome any difficulties on the road ahead. Based on our personal experience in Tibet, the materially rich Tibetan region, the hardworking and brave Tibetan people, and the capable Tibetan monastic and secular officials, under the direct leadership of the enthusiastic, wise, and patriotic Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and the CCP Tibet Working Committee, with the help of the working personnel entering Tibet and the People's Liberation Army, have made great achievements in the past few years. We firmly believe that even greater achievements will be made in the future. We confidently assert that the people of Tibet will play a brilliant role in the cause of building a socialist motherland.
    Comrades! Friends! We are about to part. The emotions of each of us are surging like the waters of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and rising and falling like the peaks of the Tanggula Mountains. We are leaving you with a feeling of infinite attachment!
    Comrades! Friends! Our separation is for the purpose of taking on the work of building the motherland separately, because our thoughts, our feelings, and our wishes are more consistent and more closely linked together. Because we not only have the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways, but also have air transport lines, therefore, our close connection has more convenient conditions, and we can meet in Beijing or Lhasa at any time.
    I wish you good health and greater progress in your work.
    I wish prosperous Tibet will become more prosperous day by day.
    I wish the hardworking and brave Tibetan people a happier life.

    陈毅向拉萨各界的告别讲话达赖喇嘛、各位同志和各位朋友：
    中央代表团今天就要离开西藏，回到北京去了。我们在西藏期间，受到了达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、中共西藏工委、人民解放军西藏军区、西藏的僧俗官员和人民的热烈接待，使我们能以胜利的完成中央和毛主席交给我们的庆祝西藏自治区筹委会成立的任务。在这里，我谨代表中央代表团的全体同志，向同志们和朋友们，并通过你们，向全西藏的人民致以深切的感谢。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，是西藏历史上的一件大事，也是我们祖国历史上的一件大事。他符合了广大人民的民主愿望，为西藏开辟了一条顺利的发展途径。我在此，再一次对西藏人民的成就表示祝贺。
    中央代表团在西藏期间，还访问和慰问了西藏各地的僧俗人民和驻军，参观了学校、医院、寺庙、农场和工厂，并且同西藏的领袖和官员交换了逐步进行民主改革和建设西藏的意见。我们在和西藏的领袖、官员和人民的广泛接触中，看到了和学到了很多宝贵的东西。我们相处的时间，虽然很短，但是我们已经建立起了深厚的友情，我们之间的团结是更加增强了。我们在祖国和西藏进行社会主义建设的伟大目标上是完全一致的，在维护祖国各民族的伟大团结上也是完全一致的，有了这种伟大的团结一致的精神，就可以克服前进道路上的任何困难。根据我们在西藏的亲身体会，物资丰饶的西藏地区，勤劳勇敢的西藏人民和有能力的西藏僧俗官员，在热情、智慧和热爱祖国的达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼两位领袖和中共西藏工委的直接领导下，在进藏工作人员和人民解放军的帮助下，过去几年已经取得了很大的成绩。我们深信今后必将获致更加巨大的成就。我们满怀信心地断言，西藏人民将在建设社会主义祖国的事业中，发挥其光辉的作用。
    同志们！朋友们！我们就要分别了。我们每一个人的感情像雅鲁藏布江水一样在冲击，像唐古拉山峰一样在起伏。我们是怀着无限依恋的心情离开你们的！
    同志们！朋友们！我们的分别是为了分头去担负建设祖国的工作，因为我们的思想，我们的感情和我们的心愿是更加一致的，是更加连结在一起的。由于我们不仅有了青藏、康藏两条公路，而且已经有了航空交通线，因此，我们之间的密切联系，已经有了更加便利的条件，我们是可以在北京或是拉萨随时见面的。
    祝大家身体健康，工作更进步，
    祝富饶的西藏日益繁荣，
    祝勤劳勇敢的西藏人民生活更加幸福。
