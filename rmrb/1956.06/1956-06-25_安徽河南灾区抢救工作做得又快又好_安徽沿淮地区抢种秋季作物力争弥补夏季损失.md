Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd—Rescue work in the flood-stricken areas of Anhui and Henan provinces is progressing rapidly. In the Bengbu Special District of Anhui Province, more than 1,700 cadres and 2.3 million farmers were mobilized to drain waterlogged fields and harvest wheat. By the 15th, over 60% of the waterlogged farmland had been drained, and 10.8 million mu of wheat (including non-disaster areas) had been harvested. In the disaster areas of Henan Province, 80% of the wheat had been harvested. To prevent the harvested wheat from becoming damp and moldy, both provinces conducted activities such as rush-drying, rush-curing, and rush-threshing while harvesting.
    Currently, all residents of villages surrounded by floods in these two provinces have been rescued. In Anhui Province, 300,000 people in flood storage and diversion areas have been relocated to safe areas. In Huai’bin County, Henan Province, 49,456 people and 20,304 livestock trapped by floodwaters have also been rescued. The local governments immediately provided relief to the rescued victims, ensuring that they all had food and shelter. Doctors were dispatched to treat sick victims.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 24th—In the areas along the Huai River in Anhui Province, over 90% of the waterlogged farmland has been drained or has receded. The 35 million mu of summer-harvested crops such as wheat have also been basically harvested. Currently, in addition to rushing to thresh wheat, farmers in this region are rushing to plant autumn crops, striving to make up for summer losses and complete the annual production increase plan. As of the 23rd, a total of 9 million mu of autumn crops have been planted and replanted in various locations. Among these, high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, as well as intercropping and multiple cropping areas, total more than 5 million mu.
