Xinhua News Agency, Baoji, 8th: Various projects to thoroughly eliminate problems on the already laid one hundred and fifty-plus kilometers of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway's northern section have fully commenced in quick succession.

Over one hundred and eighty different natural defects along the line, showing signs of landslides, rock weathering, collapses, and water seepage from strata, will be addressed and completely cured according to the nature of the problem. In the mountainous areas north of the Qinling Mountains, earthwork projects will flatten hilltops and ease slopes, targeting the instability of hillsides next to the roadbed. In the Jialing River area south of the Qinling Mountains, measures will be taken against the developed water sources within the strata which affect gravel stratum slippage, not only building open "trenches" but also constructing invisible "blind drains" inside the mountains to drain groundwater into the Jialing River, preventing water erosion of sand and gravel from damaging the roadbed. Furthermore, from Baoji to Huangsha River, the connection point, retaining walls to block collapses will be built, more "covered tunnels" will be added to protect the roadbed, and dams will be constructed to divert water into the river, ensuring that the newly built Baoji-Chengdu Railway will permanently become a standard trunk line guaranteeing safe and smooth train passage after it is officially opened to traffic along its entire length.

The area through which this railway passes was historically a seismic region, and rock fissures and weathering are relatively severe. Many conditions that could not be determined with the naked eye and instruments before design have, after the mountainside was opened during construction, revealed various natural defects that endanger the permanent safety of the roadbed. Since February of this year, engineering and technical personnel from the design and construction departments have once again surveyed the line, conducting a comprehensive investigation of natural defects. As the rails are laid southward day and night, engineering trains are passed and, at the same time, defect elimination projects are carried out sequentially.

Currently, many minor defects have been rectified completely. The entire project is expected to be basically completed by the end of June; a few projects involving concentrated earthwork and complex geological conditions will also be fully completed in phases before the end of September.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 8th: A training class for cultivating drivers and technicians for China's first electric locomotive railway, the soon-to-be-completed Baoji-Chengdu Railway, commenced on June 2nd in Fushun. The trainees are over one hundred engineering technicians and workers from five railway administrations in Beijing, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Shenyang, and Harbin.

The Transportation Department of the Fushun Mining Bureau has selected some experienced engineers, technicians, and veteran skilled workers, and organized and summarized the experience accumulated by Fushun over many years in electric locomotive transportation, preparing to systematically impart this knowledge to the trainees. In addition, incumbent operating drivers and overhead line workers are also prepared to sign "package teaching" contracts with the newcomers, teaching them their experience.

Based on these favorable conditions, the training class plans to allow trainees to spend half of their time studying operational theory and the other half on practical operations throughout the learning process, striving to shorten the originally planned two years by half a year, training the trainees into excellent electric locomotive drivers and overhead line workers in one and a half years.

    宝成路北段根治病害工程全面开始
    抚顺为宝成铁路训练电气机车司机和技术工人
    新华社宝鸡8日电　宝成铁路北段已经铺好轨道的一百五十多公里线路上，各种根除病害的工程又紧跟着全面开工了。
    沿线一百八十多处有坍方、岩石风化、崩坍、滑坡和岩层出水等迹象的不同自然病害，都将根据病源情况，分别进行根治。在秦岭以北的山岳地带，针对路基旁山坡不稳定的特征，进行削平山头放缓坡度的土石方工程。在秦岭以南嘉陵江沿岸，针对地层里水源发达影响砾石地层滑动的特征，不但要修筑一些露天的“天沟”，还要在山肚里建筑一些人们看不见的“盲沟”，把地下水排泄到嘉陵江里去，以免水源冲刷砂石伤害路基。另外，从宝鸡到接轨点黄沙河一段，还要修筑一些堵坍方的挡土墙，增建一些“明峒”保护路基，建设一些挡水坝等工程，以便把水源方向拨到江里去，使新建成的宝成铁路在全线正式通车以后，永远成为一条保证安全畅通火车的标准干线。
    这段铁路经过的地方，原是历史性的地震区域，岩石裂缝和风化的情况比较严重，许多在设计以前无法用肉眼和仪器判明的情况，在施工过程中山体被劈开以后，却看出是各式各样危害路基永久安全的自然病害。今年二月以来，设计和施工部门的工程技术人员，又一次踏勘沿线，对自然病害做了全面调查。在铁轨日夜向南铺进的过程中，一面通行工程列车，一面便顺序进行根除病害工程。
    现在，许多微小的病害已经整治断根。全部工程在六月底可以基本上治理完毕；少数土石方集中、地质复杂的工程，也将在九月底以前全部分期完工。
    新华社抚顺8日电　为我国即将修成的第一条电气机车铁路——宝成铁路培养司机和技术工人的训练班，六月二日在抚顺开学。参加这个训练班学习的，是来自北京、济南、郑州、沈阳和哈尔滨等五个铁路管理局的一百多名工程技术人员和工人。
    抚顺矿务局运输部抽调了一些有经验的工程师、技术员和老技术工人，整理和总结了抚顺在多年以来所积累的电气机车运输方面的经验，准备向前来学习的学员们进行有系统的传授。另外，在职操作的老司机和架线工人们，也准备同新来的客人们订立包教合同，把自己的经验教给他们。
    根据这些有利条件，训练班计划在整个学习过程中让学员们用一半的时间学习操作理论，另一半的时间到实地操作，争取比原计划缩短半年在一年半的时间里，把学员们培养成出色的电气机车驾驶员和架线等工人。
