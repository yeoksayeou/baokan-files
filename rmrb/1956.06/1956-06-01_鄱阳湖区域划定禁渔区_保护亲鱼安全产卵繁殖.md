Poyang Lake Region Designates No-Fishing Zones
    Protect Parent Fish for Safe Spawning and Reproduction
    This year, counties around Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province have selected twenty lakes with good conditions for parent fish spawning as no-fishing breeding protection zones. During the no-fishing period, the lake water rose to a suitable level, and the parent fish entered the lake to spawn in a timely manner. It is estimated that approximately 300 million young fish can be bred. Currently, various counties are mobilizing the masses to improve fishing gear and methods, ensuring that large fish are caught and small fish are released, in order to ensure the growth of young fish.

    鄱阳湖区域划定禁渔区  
    保护亲鱼安全产卵繁殖
    江西省鄱阳湖滨湖各县，今年选定了亲鱼产卵条件较好的二十个湖作为禁渔繁殖保护区。在禁捕期间，湖水涨得适宜，亲鱼及时进湖产卵，预计可以繁殖幼鱼三亿尾左右。现在各县正在发动群众改进渔具和捕鱼方法，做到捕大鱼放小鱼，以便确保幼鱼的成长。
