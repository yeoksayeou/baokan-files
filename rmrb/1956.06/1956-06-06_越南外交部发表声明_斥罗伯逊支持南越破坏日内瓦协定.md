Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 5th: The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today saying that the statement made by US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson regarding the US policy toward Vietnam proves that the US authorities' conspiracy is to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a US colony and military base.

In his statement on June 1st, Robertson announced that the United States would continue to provide military assistance to South Vietnam and firmly support the South Vietnamese regime's refusal to participate in consultations on the issue of Vietnamese reunification.

The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that Robertson's statement confirms that the US authorities have been making every effort to build and strengthen the military forces of South Vietnam, and that the United States has in fact formed a military alliance with South Vietnam. Robertson's statement also confirms that the US authorities are instigating the South Vietnamese regime to violate the political terms of the Geneva Accords regarding the reunification of Vietnam, in order to permanently divide Vietnam.

The spokesman said that Robertson's statement also proves that the US authorities do not respect and openly encourage the South Vietnamese regime not to implement the recommendations of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. In their letter to the authorities of the two regions of Vietnam on May 8th, the two chairmen suggested that they must respect and implement the Geneva Accords.

The spokesman refuted Robertson's slander that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam accepted foreign military personnel and weapons. The spokesman said that this unfounded slander is nothing more than an attempt to cover up the US authorities' conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords. In fact, since the restoration of peace, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has demobilized more than 50,000 troops and will continue to demobilize some troops to promote the restoration of North Vietnam and implement plans for economic and cultural development.

The spokesman concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely oppose the conspiracy to undermine the peace and unification of Vietnam, and strongly oppose the statement made by US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson on June 1st. The US government and the South Vietnamese regime must be held responsible for their continued violation of the Geneva Accords.

    越南外交部发表声明
    斥罗伯逊支持南越破坏日内瓦协定
    新华社河内5日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天发表声明说，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊发表的关于美国对越南的政策的声明，证明美国当局的阴谋是长期分割越南、把南越变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。
    罗伯逊在六月一日的声明中，曾经宣布美国将继续给予南越军事援助，并且坚决支持南越政权拒绝参加有关越南统一问题的协商。
    越南外交部发言人指出，罗伯逊的声明证实了美国当局一直在竭力帮助南越建立和加强军事力量，并且在实际上美国已经和南越结成一个军事联盟。罗伯逊的声明还证实了美国当局正在唆使南越政权违反有关实现越南统一的日内瓦协定的政治条款，以长期分割越南。
    发言人说，罗伯逊的声明还证明美国当局不尊重、并且公然鼓励南越政权不实现日内瓦会议两位主席的建议。两位主席在五月八日给越南两地区当局的信中曾经建议它们必须尊重和履行日内瓦协定。
    发言人驳斥了罗伯逊关于越南民主共和国政府接受外国军事人员和武器的诬蔑。发言人说，这种毫无根据的诬蔑不过是一种企图掩盖美国当局破坏日内瓦协定的阴谋的手段。事实上，自从和平恢复以来，越南民主共和国政府已经让五万人以上的军队复员，并且将继续让一些军队复员，以促进越南北方的恢复和实现发展经济、文化的计划。
    发言人最后说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决反对破坏越南的和平和统一的阴谋，强烈反对美国助理国务卿罗伯逊六月一日的声明。美国政府和南越政权必须对它们破坏日内瓦协定的继续履行负责。
