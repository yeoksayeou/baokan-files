Giving Play to the Positive Role of Engineering and Technical Personnel
    -- Speech by Representative Wang Dezhi
    Improving Class Consciousness and Learning the Latest Science and Technology -- Doing a Good Job of Coordination and Cooperation -- Doing a Good Job of Summarizing and Promoting Advanced Experiences -- Doing a Good Job of Preparations Before Construction -- Cultivating New Forces and Expanding the Technical Ranks
      After listening to Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, I deeply realized the splendid achievements of our country's socialist construction, and at the same time, I also realized that there are still many difficulties in our progress, waiting for us to overcome them with unparalleled fighting spirit.
      I am a staff member of a state organ and also a mining engineer, engaged in coal mining work for more than 30 years. Now I would like to talk about how our engineering and technical personnel can play our positive role and overcome all difficulties to make our economic construction more, faster, better, and more economical in the coal mining industry that I am familiar with. Of course, this is just my personal opinion. Errors are inevitable, please criticize and correct me.
      First of all, our engineering and technical personnel must continue to improve our class consciousness, actively study Marxism-Leninism to arm our minds, and actively learn the latest scientific and technological achievements to enrich our skills. Only by constantly improving in political thought and science and technology can we do a good job. The two are indispensable. Some people think that as long as the calculated numbers are correct, the task is completed, and the policies and guidelines are the responsibility of the leadership. Recently, some people have also advocated that in order to advance towards science, political study can be relaxed or not studied at all. These views are incorrect. We must adhere to the principle of political guidance over technology and technology serving politics. Only under this premise can technical problems be rationally solved.
    Recently, everyone in our organization has subscribed to a long-term plan to advance towards science, and generally, they have set the progress and goals of political study and scientific and technological advancement. Moving forward side by side. This is entirely correct. Only by advancing in this way can we transform ourselves into truly useful people in the new society. I am doing this too.
    Second, do a good job of coordination and cooperation: Our national economy is developing in a planned and proportional manner, which is most clearly reflected in the state's 1955 final accounts and 1956 budget. This requires a high degree of coordination and cooperation between industry and agriculture, between heavy industry and light industry, between the central government and local governments, between various departments, and between various workers to achieve this goal. Any department or any worker has the obligation to coordinate and cooperate, and at the same time, has the power to request cooperation from others. We require everyone to be an active collaborator rather than a lone wolf. But there are indeed lone wolves at present. For example, the 142 Team of the North China Coalfield Geological Bureau and the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau work in the same coalfield and live together, but the engineers of the Mining Bureau do not actively understand the geological data to study the direction of roadway excavation, and the comrades of the Geological Team do not actively ask the Mining Bureau for the roadway excavation data in the well to correct their inferences about the geological structure. Due to the lack of good cooperation, both geological work and well construction work have taken some detours. If they had cooperated closely earlier, I think their work would have been completed better than it is now.
    At the same time, we also have active collaborators. For example, the East China region urgently needs coal, but there is no reliable geological data for well construction. The comrades of the East China Design Institute and the Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau cooperated closely. The geological staff promptly informed the design department of the exploration data, and the design department also promptly informed the geological staff of the design requirements for geological data. It is precisely because of this mutual cooperation that the geological department put forward a geological report that meets the design requirements, and the design department can quickly make a design that guarantees quality, basically meeting the needs of well construction.
    How to do a good job of cooperation? I personally believe that under the principle of individual interests serving the overall interests, mutual trust, mutual understanding, mutual assistance, and mutual understanding of each other's difficulties, and when there are disputes, we should calmly think about it from the other's perspective, then there is nothing that cannot be cooperated with.
    Third, do a good job of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences: In recent years, there have been many advanced experiences in the coal industry system. However, the promotion to the whole country or several major regions is not enough. Like general coal mining systems, cement supports, taking materials locally, steel grit drilling, chemical mud, etc., have been promoted to varying degrees, but there are still many to be promoted.
    Why is this so? Although there are many objective and subjective factors, I think the following three factors are the main ones:
      (1) Our engineering and technical personnel do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of promoting advanced experiences, and do not have a sufficient understanding of the arduous struggle between advanced and conservative ideas in the promotion of advanced experiences. Therefore, they do not learn advanced experiences humbly enough, and they do not study them deeply and thoroughly. They have not used scientific theories and methods to summarize them well, enrich their content, and formulate operating procedures and practical conditions.
      (2) Some units mistakenly choose good tools and good working environments for the advanced in order to keep them advanced. This gives the backward an excuse and separates the advanced from the masses. We should not only help the advanced, but also give more help to the backward, promote the backward to catch up with the advanced, and then advanced experiences can be promoted. Only by helping the advanced to improve technically through scientific and technological methods can advanced experiences be gradually improved.
      (3) Specific organizational work has not kept up. We must have specific organizational measures to promote advanced experiences. I suggest that the form of this measure be a "demonstration project". This is even more important in the coal industry. Taking well construction projects as an example, our advanced experiences include the parallel operation of the Ping'an vertical shaft in Fuxin, with a monthly progress of 80.6 meters; the single-row operation of the Tongchuan vertical shaft, with a monthly progress of 61.32 meters; the rock flat lane excavation in Guangyuan, with a monthly progress of 201 meters (the highest daily progress is 13.05 meters); the integral vertical shaft frame in Datong, and the parallel operation of pre-fabricated beam sockets and can beams and can lanes in Huainan, etc. If these scattered, partial, but mature experiences are organized and studied to make them cooperate with each other to become an organic whole, and incorporated into a project for demonstration, and at the same time, people are organized to participate in the study, the effect is difficult to estimate. Therefore, we must use all our strength to do this key work well.
    Fourth, do a good job of preparation before construction, especially the preparation for developing new mining areas. In addition to the general preparation of construction forces, installation forces, materials and equipment, etc., the preparation work for mine construction must also be done in advance based on its characteristics, such as railways, highways, power sources, water sources, and transportation tools. These tasks need to be started from scratch in new areas, and generally need to be started two years in advance, so they are particularly important.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan, the coal industry will build many mines in the southwest and northwest regions. The northwest is sparsely populated and has a severe shortage of water; the southwest is full of mountains and valleys, and transportation is extremely difficult. We must also carry out preparations based on these characteristics. In the specific work in the new area, we must focus on the following tasks:
      (1) Before construction starts, housing, transportation, power supply, and water source must be solved at the same time, because most of these areas do not have ready-made equipment and housing available.
      (2) Do a good job of investigating and studying local materials and conduct scientific experiments. All materials that can be used locally must be fully utilized to minimize the materials transported from outside, in order to overcome the difficulties in transportation and supply.
      (3) Do a good job in labor training. The source of labor should basically be taken from the local area or its vicinity, and only backbones can be transferred from outside. Therefore, labor must be trained in advance.
      (4) The construction equipment and transportation machinery must be appropriately improved to compensate for the lack of local human and material resources.
    Fifth, vigorously cultivate new forces and expand the technical ranks: At present, some capital construction units in the coal industry do not have a mature engineer, and new workers account for 70-80%. Therefore, the task is not completed well, and there are certain problems with cost and quality. The solution: In addition to the formal training undertaken by schools, in order to meet the current urgent needs, we must also use methods such as opening classes for rotation training in enterprises, signing contracts between masters and apprentices, spare-time schools, professional societies, etc. to cultivate them at the same time. Engineering and technical personnel should take on this glorious task.
    The second is to establish and improve technical leadership institutions. The central government has established the National Technology Commission, which is a timely and wise measure. However, most industrial departments do not have a core technical leadership institution, or it is not sound enough. When encountering technical problems, various functional departments deal with them sporadically. This has a certain impact on the advance towards science. Therefore, I suggest that each ministry establish a strong technical leadership institution - such as a technology committee, organize Chinese and foreign experts from this department to lead scientific research work, lead the advance towards science, study technical directions, solve technical problems, and play the role of a staff headquarters for the advance towards science.
    In short, we are optimistic about the future of our great cause, but there are also many difficulties to be overcome. What is placed before us today is not that heroes have no place to use their abilities, but a deep feeling that our scientific and technological knowledge is poor and cannot meet the needs of our work. However, we have enough confidence and courage to do our best to overcome all difficulties and make our socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economical, and contribute everything we have to realize the highest ideals of mankind.

    发挥工程技术人员的积极作用
    ——王德滋代表的发言
    提高阶级觉悟，学习最新的科学技术——做好配合协作——做好先进经验的总结和推广工作——做好施工前的准备工作——培养新生力量，扩大技术队伍
      我听了李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告后，使我深切地认识到我国社会主义建设的辉煌成就，同时亦体会到尚有不少前进中的困难，待我们以无比的战斗精神来克服。
      我是一个国家机关工作人员，亦是一个采矿工程师，从事于煤矿工作30余年。现在我想就我熟习的煤矿工业来谈一谈我们工程技术人员如何发挥我们的积极作用，克服一切困难来使我们的经济建设作的又多、又快、又好、又省。当然这只是我个人的见解。错误难免，请批评指正。
      首先，我们工程技术人员，必须继续提高自己的阶级觉悟，积极的学习马克思、列宁主义来武装我们的头脑，积极的学习最新的科学技术成就，来充实我们的技能，只有在政治思想上、科学技术上不断的提高，我们才能搞好工作，两者缺一不可。有人认为：只要将计算的数目字算对便完成了任务，方针政策是领导上的事情。最近也有人主张：为了向科学进军，政治学习可以放松些，或者不学。这些看法都是不正确的。我们必须坚持政治指导技术，技术为政治服务的原则，惟有在这个前提下，技术问题才能得到合理的解决。
    最近我们机关里大家都订了向科学进军的长远规划，一般都订了政治学习和科学技术进修的进度和目标。并驾齐驱地前进。这是完全正确的。只有这样的前进，才能改造我们自己成为一个新社会中真正有用的人。我也正在这样做。
    第二，作好配合协作：我国国民经济是有计划按比例地发展的，在国家的1955年决算和1956年预算中体现得最清楚，这就要求工业与农业间、重工业与轻工业间、中央与地方间、各部间、各工作者间高度的配合协作，才能达到这个目的。任何部门、任何工作者均有配合协作的义务，同时也有要求旁人协作的权力，我们要求每一个人当一个积极的协作者而不是当一个单干户。但是目前确有单干户存在。如华北煤田地质局142队与太原西山矿务局同在一个煤田内工作，并同住在一起，但矿务局的工程师不主动地去了解地质方面的资料来研究巷道掘进的方向，而地质队的同志也不主动向矿务局要井下巷道掘进的资料，来较正他们对地质构造的推论，由于未很好的协作，致使地质工作和建井工作都走了一定的弯路。假如他们早日密切配合，我想他们的工作一定会完成的比现在好。
    同时我们亦有积极的协作者。如华东地区需煤很急，但无可靠的地质资料，以供建井之用。华东设计院与煤田地质勘探局的同志们密切的合作，地质工作人员及时的将勘探资料告知设计部门，而设计部门也将设计方面对地质资料的要求及时的告知地质工作人员，正由于这样互相配合协作的结果，地质部门提出了适合设计要求的地质报告，而设计部门也能很快地作出保证质量的设计，基本上满足了建井的需要。
    如何来搞好协作？我个人认为在个体利益服从整体利益的原则下，互相信任、互相了解、互相帮助、互相体谅对方的困难，遇有争执时，应心平气和的设身处地的想一想，则无不能协作的事情。
    第三，作好先进经验的总结和推广工作：几年来煤炭工业系统的先进经验是很多的。但是推广及全国或几个大区的则不够多。像一般采煤制，洋灰支架，就地取材，钢砂钻进，化学泥浆等等，已有不同程度的推广外，尚有很多待推广。
    为什么会这样呢？客观及主观的因素虽多，我认为下列三个因素是主要的：
      （1）我们工程技术人员对推广先进经验的重要性认识不足，对于先进经验的推广是一个先进思想与保守思想的坚苦斗争认识不够。因此对于先进经验学习不够虚心，研究不深不透，未用科学的理论和方法将其很好地总结出来，充实它的内容，制定出操作规程和实用条件。
      （2）有的单位他们错误的为使先进者保持先进，而给他们选择好的工具、好的工作环境，这样即使后进者有所借口，使先进者脱离群众。我们不仅对先进者要帮助，对后进者更应给以较多的帮助，推动后进赶上先进，先进经验才能推广。惟有用科学技术的方法帮助先进者在技术上提高一步，先进经验才能逐步提高。
      （3）具体组织工作未跟上去。我们推广先进经验必须有具体的组织措施，这个措施的形式我建议为“示范工程”，这点在煤炭工业更为重要。拿建井工程来说，我们的先进经验有阜新平安立井的平行作业，月进80.6公尺；有铜川立井的单行作业，月进61.32公尺；有广元的岩石平巷掘进，月进201公尺（最高日进度为13.05公尺）；大同的整体立井架、淮南的预制梁窝和罐梁、罐道的平行作业等等。如将这些分散的、局部的、但是成熟的经验加以组织研究，使之互相配合成为一个有机体，而纳入一个工程中来示范，同时组织人员来参加学习，其效果是难以估计的。因此我们必须用一切力量将这一关键性工作搞好。
    第四，作好施工前的准备工作，尤其是开发新矿区的准备工作。矿井建设的准备工作除施工力量、安装力量、材料和设备等一般的准备外，还必须根据它的特点提前做好铁路、公路、电源、水源以及运输工具等准备工作。这些工作在新区里需要从头做起，一般二年以前即须动手，因此更显得特别重要。
    第二个五年计划内煤炭工业将在西南、西北地区建设很多的矿井。西北是人烟稀少，水源奇缺；西南是丛山峻岭，交通异常困难。更必须根据这些特点来进行准备，在新区的具体工作中主要抓紧下面几项工作：
      （1）必须在开工以前，将住宅与交通、电源、水源同时解决，因为在这些地区大多数是没有现成设备和住房可资利用的。
      （2）做好当地材料的调查研究工作，并作出科学试验，凡当地可能利用的材料必须充分利用，尽量减少由外面运入的物资，以克服运输上和供应上不及时的困难。
      （3）做好劳动力培养工作。劳动力的来源应基本上取之当地或其附近，外面只能调配骨干，因此劳动力必须预先培养好。
      （4）施工设备及运输机械必须适当的提高，以补救当地人力、物力不足的困难。
    第五，大力培养新生力量，扩大技术队伍：当前煤炭工业有些基建单位没有一个成熟的工程师，而新工人亦占70—80％，因此任务完成的不够好，成本和质量亦有一定的问题。解决的办法：除正规的培养由学校来担任外，为了当前的急需，我们还必须同时在企业中利用开班轮训，师徒合同，业余学校，专业学会等等办法来培养，工程技术人员应将这个光荣的任务担起来。
    其次是建立和健全技术领导机构。中央已经成立了国家技术委员会，这是适时的英明的措施。但大多数工业部门尚无技术的核心领导机构，或者不够健全，遇到技术问题由各职能部门零星应付。这对向科学进军是有一定影响的。因此，我建议各个部成立一个强有力的技术领导机构——如技术委员会之类，将本部门的中外专家组织进去，领导科学研究工作，领导向科学进军、研究技术方向、解决技术上的疑难问题，起着向科学进军的参谋部的作用。
    总之我们对于我们伟大事业的前途是乐观的，但也有不少待克服的困难。今天摆在我们面前的不是英雄无用武之地，而是深深地感到我们科学技术知识的贫乏，满足不了工作中的需要，但是我们有足够的信心和勇气，尽我们最大的努力，克服一切困难，将我们的社会主义建设事业搞得又多、又快、又好、又省，为实现人类的最高理想而供献出我们的一切。
