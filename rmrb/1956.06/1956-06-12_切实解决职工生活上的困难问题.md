The lives of our country's workers and staff have indeed improved significantly since the national liberation. However, if we compare it with what should be done and what is possible, it should be said that it can be improved even more. Comparing the increase in labor productivity and wages over the years, the National Wage Conference held by the State Council in April of this year has already shown that the two are not commensurate. Currently, the whole country is preparing for wage reform. Here, we do not intend to talk about wage issues, but only about labor insurance and housing issues.

At present, the number of workers and staff enjoying labor insurance benefits in the country is nine times that of 1949. The state's appropriation of labor insurance funds has also increased year by year: it was 80 million yuan in 1951, and it increased to 500 million yuan in 1955. However, since 1951, the Labor Insurance Regulations have only been implemented in factories and mines with more than 100 people, and the scope is still relatively narrow. Such a scope can no longer meet the needs of the current socialist construction cause and the requirements of the broad masses of working people. Some provisions of the Labor Insurance Regulations are also not entirely reasonable and have not been revised in a timely manner as the situation changes, and have even had a negative impact. For example, the provisions for employees to pay for their own medical treatment for illnesses and expensive medicines have increased the burden on many employees. In addition, the health department has stipulated clearly inappropriate profits for medicines, and the hospitalization costs stipulated by the employee medical departments are too high, placing too heavy a burden on employees, so that many employees have incurred a lot of debt due to their own or their families' medical treatment, causing difficulties in the lives of employees. At the same time, the work of the trade union organizations entrusted by the state to manage labor insurance business is not deep enough, and there has been a situation in which some insurance funds have been stockpiled on the one hand, while the actual difficulties of employees have not been properly resolved on the other hand. These situations must be changed quickly.

The state has invested a large amount of money in housing construction in recent years. Before 1952, houses were built for one million people, and in the first three years of the first five-year plan, more than 30 million square meters of houses were built, but the housing problem for employees is still very tight. According to incomplete statistics from eighteen provinces, three cities, and two industries, on average, about 10% of employees urgently need to solve the housing problem. These employees either live in bunkers or caves, or several generations live in the same room or several families live in the same room, or couples live separately, or they want to get married but have no house. Of course, the living conditions of employees in old China were very bad, and the industrial population has grown rapidly after liberation, and the housing problem cannot be completely solved in a short period of time, but the lack of attention to the housing problem of employees by some departments, the lack of understanding of the urgent requirements of employees for housing, and the failure to take serious measures to use the state's investment in housing construction reasonably are also important reasons for the housing difficulties.

In addition, the rents in many cities are unreasonable, especially the rents for private houses are too expensive, the profits of public utilities in some cities are too high, and water, electricity, and transportation costs are unreasonable, which also directly affects the lives of employees. Other aspects such as the supply of daily necessities, canteens, and nurseries also have many problems.

The above-mentioned problems should be solved and can be gradually solved. Recently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened a national trade union labor insurance, life, and housing work conference, which comprehensively studied the difficulties in the lives of workers and staff, and put forward suggestions for revising the Labor Insurance Regulations and solutions to the current difficulties in the lives of workers and staff, which is very necessary. However, the real solution to the difficulties in the lives of the masses of workers and staff lies in overcoming the bureaucratic work style of not caring about the vital interests of the masses of workers and staff. Enterprise leaders must consider the welfare of the masses of workers and staff while considering production issues. Because only by gradually increasing personal income and improving personal life on the basis of developing production can we further develop the enthusiasm of the masses of workers and staff and continuously improve labor productivity.

Facts have proved that as long as enterprise leaders pay attention to the life problems of workers and staff, then the life difficulties of workers and staff are equal to solving more than half of the problem. For example, recently the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry studied the housing problem of workers and formulated a specific plan to solve these problems. If all national economic departments conduct a study on employee housing and other issues related to the difficulties in the lives of employees, and correct the current phenomenon of no one being responsible for employee welfare issues, and entrust specialized institutions to handle them, many problems will not be delayed for a long time, but can be solved in a timely manner. For example, the Harbin Municipal People's Committee formulated a method to solve the rent problem, which reduced the rent by about 45%, without increasing state expenditure or spending much effort, and solved the problem for the masses of workers and staff.

Urban public utilities, especially water, electricity, and transportation enterprises that are most closely related to the lives of workers and staff, must take measures to reduce management costs and reduce costs in a planned manner, in order to reduce the burden on consumers. The medical and health departments should appropriately adjust drug prices and abolish unreasonable systems such as hospitalization deposits to reduce the burden on employees in terms of medical treatment. The commercial departments should continuously improve business management, and expand and adjust the commercial network in a planned manner to ensure the supply of materials for workers and staff in factories and mines, especially those in the very difficult living conditions in forest areas and surveying and drilling personnel. Trade union organizations should do a good job in providing hardship subsidies to employees, run mutual aid savings societies well, and promote class friendship, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit. In short, we must solve the current difficulties in the lives of employees in a planned, step-by-step, and realistic manner from all aspects.

The Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League must pay attention to the actual life problems of the masses of workers and staff in their daily work, actively solve these problems, gradually improve the material and cultural life of the masses of workers and staff on the basis of increasing labor productivity and developing production, meet the needs of the masses according to the principle of necessity and possibility, and carry out struggles against all bureaucratic phenomena that disregard the suffering of the masses and capitalist management ideas in one way or another. When solving the difficulties in the lives of the masses, we must also adopt the mass line method and oppose all forms of paternalistic practices.

Trade union organizations have the responsibility to organize the masses of workers and staff to conduct public supervision over the construction and distribution of housing, the supply of daily necessities, and canteens, and all welfare undertakings related to the lives of the masses of workers and staff. Because trade union organizations have a major responsibility to protect the daily interests of workers and staff. In a country led by the working class, trade union organizations must, on the one hand, protect the interests of the state, that is, the overall interests of the working class, from being harmed; at the same time, they must also protect the personal interests of workers and staff from being infringed upon by those bureaucratic elements. It is wrong for some trade union cadres to be afraid of ruining relations and not expose or fight against phenomena that violate the policies of the Party and the state and harm the interests of the masses of workers and staff. Only by caring about the lives of the masses and helping them solve their life difficulties can trade union organizations closely connect with the masses of workers and staff, further unite the masses of workers and staff around the Party, and better develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of workers and staff to complete and overfulfill the various tasks in the socialist construction cause.

### 切实解决职工生活上的困难问题

    切实解决职工生活上的困难问题
    我国的职工生活，在全国解放以来，的确有了显著的改善。但是，如果拿它和应当做到而且可能做到的程度来比较，那就应当说是还可以改善得更多些的。拿几年来劳动生产率和工资的增长来比较，今年四月间国务院召开的全国工资会议已经说明，二者之间是不相称的。现在，全国正在进行工资改革的准备工作。这里，我们不准备说工资方面的问题，只打算说一说劳动保险和生活居住方面的问题。
    目前全国享受劳动保险待遇的职工，相当于1949年的九倍。国家对劳动保险费用的拨款也是历年增加的：1951年是八千万元，1955年就增加到五亿元。可是1951年以来，劳动保险条例只在百人以上的厂矿企业施行，范围还比较狭小。这样的范围已经不能适应当前社会主义建设事业发展的需要和广大劳动群众的要求了。劳动保险条例的某些规定也不尽合理，没有随着情况的变化及时加以修正，甚至发生了消极作用。比如职工疾病医疗、贵重药品自理的规定，就增加了不少职工的负担。再加上卫生部门对药品规定了显然不妥当的利润，职工医疗部门规定的住院费用过高，使职工负担过重，以致不少职工因自己或家属治病而负债很多，造成职工生活困难。同时，国家委托主管劳动保险业务的工会组织的工作也不够深入，曾经形成一方面积压了一部分保险金，另方面职工的实际困难却得不到适当的解决。这些情况是必须迅速加以改变的。
    国家对住宅建设的投资，几年来已有很大的数目。1952年以前共修建了可供一百万人居住的住宅，第一个五年计划的前三年修建了三千多万平方公尺住宅，可是职工住宅问题仍然很紧张。据十八个省三个市两个产业不完全的统计，大约平均有10％左右的职工迫切需要解决住宅问题，这些职工或者住在碉堡、土洞里，或者几代同居一室或几家同居一室，或者夫妇分居，或者要结婚而没有房子。固然，旧中国职工的居住条件十分恶劣，解放后工业人口迅速增长，住宅问题不可能在短时期全部解决，可是某些部门对职工住宅问题重视不够，不了解职工对住宅问题的迫切要求，没有认真采取措施，使用国家对建设住宅的投资不尽合理，也是造成房屋困难的重要原因。
    此外，不少城市的房租不合理，尤其是租赁私人房屋的租金太贵，有些城市公用事业利润过高，水、电、交通费不合理，这些也都直接影响职工的生活。其他像生活必需品的供应、食堂、托儿所等方面也都存在着不少问题。
    上述几方面的问题都应该加以解决也有可能逐步得到解决。最近，中华全国总工会召开了全国工会劳动保险生活住宅工作会议，全面地研究了职工生活中的困难问题，提出了修改劳动保险条例的建议和解决当前职工生活困难问题的办法，这是很必要的。但是，职工群众生活困难问题的真正解决，关键在于克服不关心职工群众切身生活利益的官僚主义作风。企业领导人员，在考虑生产问题的同时，必须考虑职工群众的生活福利问题。因为只有在发展生产的基础上逐步增加个人的收入，改善个人的生活，才能进一步发挥职工群众的积极性，不断提高劳动生产率。
    事实证明，只要企业领导人员对职工生活问题加以重视，那末，职工生活困难问题就等于解决了大半。比如，最近冶金工业部研究了工人的生活住宅问题，就拟定了解决这些问题的具体规划。如果所有的国民经济部门，都把职工住宅和其他有关职工生活困难问题进行一次研究，并且纠正目前对职工生活福利问题的无人负责现象，委托专门的机构去办理，许多问题就不会拖延很久，而是可以及时得到解决的。又比如，哈尔滨市人民委员会拟定了解决房租问题的办法，使房租降低了45％左右，却没有增加国家开支，也没有费很大力气，就给职工群众解决了问题。
    城市的公用事业，特别是和职工生活关系最密切的水、电、交通企业必须采取措施，有计划地减少管理费用，降低成本，以减少消费者的负担。医药卫生部门应该适当调整药价，取消住院押金之类的不合理制度，以减轻职工疾病医疗方面的负担。商业部门应该不断改善经营管理，有计划地扩大和调整商业网，以保证厂矿企业职工，特别是生活十分艰苦的林区职工和勘测钻探人员的物质供应。工会组织应该作好职工困难补助工作，办好互助储金会，发扬阶级友爱，互助互济。总之，我们必须从各个方面，有计划、有步骤地实事求是地解决当前职工生活中的困难问题。
    党、工会和青年团在自己的日常工作中，必须注意职工群众的实际生活问题，积极地去解决这些问题，必须在提高劳动生产率、发展生产的基础上逐步改善职工群众的物质生活和文化生活，必须根据必要和可能的原则满足群众的需要，向一切漠视群众疾苦的官僚主义现象以及这样或那样的资本主义经营思想进行斗争。在解决群众生活困难问题的时候，也必须采取群众路线的方法，反对各种形式的恩赐作法。
    工会组织有责任组织职工群众对住宅的建设和分配、生活必需品的供应和食堂等一切有关职工群众生活福利事业进行公共监督。因为工会组织在保护职工的日常利益上负有重大责任。在工人阶级领导的国家里，工会组织一方面必须保护国家利益即工人阶级的整体利益不受损害；同时，也要保护职工的个人利益不受那些官僚主义分子的侵害。某些工会干部害怕搞坏关系，遇见违背党和国家政策、损害职工群众利益的现象也不揭发，不斗争，那是不对的。工会组织只有关心群众生活，帮助群众解决生活困难，才能密切和职工群众的联系，把职工群众进一步团结在党的周围；才能更好地发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，完成和超额完成社会主义建设事业中的各项任务。
