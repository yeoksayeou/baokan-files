The comprehensive survey of the Qinglongxia Irrigation Project on the Yellow River in Gansu Province has begun. Surveying and geological personnel are conducting topographic surveys, dam site drilling, and hydrogeological experimental research over an area of more than 6,000 square kilometers. They are to submit the preliminary design data for this huge project in the second half of this year.

The Qinglongxia Irrigation Project is one of the largest projects in the development and management plan of the Yellow River. It is located in the original Ningxia irrigation area, which has always been known as the "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall." Currently, it is divided between the Yinchuan Special District and the Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture, with more than two million mu of irrigated land. The area has a very long history of agricultural irrigation, including the Qin Canal, Han Canal, and Tang Canal built during the Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties. It is rich in rice and is a major grain crop production area in Gansu Province. The Qinglongxia Irrigation Project includes the construction of a key hub dam project on the Yellow River and the new construction and renovation of a large-scale irrigation and drainage system. After these projects are completed, the irrigated area will be increased by one and a half times, and the original area will have nearly six million mu of irrigated land. At the same time, due to the improvement of the drainage system, the problem of soil salinization, which is currently the most difficult problem for farmers, can also be fundamentally solved.

    黄河青铜峡灌溉工程开始全面勘测
    本报讯　甘肃省青铜峡灌溉工程的勘测工作，已全面展开。测量地质人员在六千多平方公里大的面积内，进行着地形测量、坝址钻探和水文地质的试验研究工作。他们要在今年下半年交出这一巨大工程的初步设计资料。
    青铜峡灌溉工程是开发和治理黄河规划中的最大工程之一，它所在的地方，即一向被人们称作“塞外江南”的原宁夏灌区，目前分属于银川专区和吴忠回族自治州，有二百多万亩水地。这个地区的农田水利，历史极为悠久，有秦、汉、唐历代所修的秦渠、汉渠、唐渠；盛产水稻，为甘肃省粮食作物的主要产地。青铜峡灌溉工程包括在黄河修起一个枢纽闸坝工程和新修、改修规模巨大的排灌系统。这些工程完成后，灌溉面积要增加一倍半，加上原来的将有近六百万亩水地。同时，由于排水系统的改善，目前农民最感困难的土壤盐碱化问题，也可获得根本解决。
