Help Poor Peasant Cooperative Members Work More
    Xiong Guoxian

    In some agricultural production cooperatives in Hunan Province, there is a noteworthy issue: the labor days of poor peasant cooperative members are generally fewer than those of middle peasant cooperative members. For example, in the second cooperative of Wanfu Township, Hengshan County, a mid-April survey showed that middle peasant cooperative members had earned an average of 460 work points per laborer, while poor peasant cooperative members had earned only 260 work points on average. In the sixth brigade, fourth team of the Jili Cooperative in Jili Township, Liuyang County, since the establishment of the cooperative, middle peasant cooperative members had averaged 556 points, while poor peasant cooperative members had only averaged 307 points. This phenomenon exists in counties such as Ningxiang, Wangcheng, Linxiang, and Qidong.

    Why is there such a large difference in work points between middle and poor peasant cooperative members? The main reason is that the difficulties of poor peasant cooperative members in production and life are not resolved, and they cannot work regularly. For example, in the Zhurong Peak Agricultural Cooperative in Hengshan Township, Hengshan County, middle peasant cooperative members ridiculed poor peasant cooperative members as "unable to work for three reasons": they cannot work on sunny days without hoes or harrows; they cannot work on rainy days without raincoats or straw hats; and they cannot work without money or grain. Zuo Guinan, a poor peasant cooperative member in Jinxi Township, Changsha County, anxiously told the leaders of the cooperative during spring plowing: I have no drag boards for going to the fields, no harrows for turning fertilizer, and I only worked half a day in six days. Because poor peasant cooperative members lack money, grain, and farm tools, some middle peasant cooperative members say that poor peasant cooperative members are doing odd jobs. Work assignments within the cooperative are also prioritized for middle peasants over poor peasants. For example, Xie Zhengkun, a poor peasant cooperative member in the Zhenzhou Agricultural Cooperative in Ningxiang County, is an excellent rice seedling cultivator, but the cooperative assigned him to collect coal ash, while assigning the seedling cultivation work to inexperienced middle peasants.

    If this situation is not changed, the economic difficulties of poor peasant cooperative members cannot be quickly resolved, and the political advantages of the poor peasants cannot be truly established, which will inevitably affect the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in various regions should conduct a general inspection of the work attendance of cooperative members and quickly change the situation of poor peasant cooperative members working too little. For cooperative members who have difficulties in life, they can be organized to engage in some sideline production managed uniformly by the cooperative and by the cooperative members individually. Establish and improve the pre-distribution system so that cooperative members with production difficulties can solve their immediate living problems through pre-distribution. For cooperative members who lack small farm tools and rain gear, assistance can be provided by having the cooperative make them or by arranging for borrowing. The work attendance of poor peasant cooperative members should be arranged reasonably. Without affecting the regular work attendance of other cooperative members, they should be given priority in assigning appropriate farm work to increase their opportunities for work. In short, we must help poor peasant cooperative members work more in all aspects and help them increase their income.

    帮助贫农社员多出工
    熊国贤
    在湖南省的一些农业生产合作社里，有这样一个值得引起注意的问题：即贫农社员的劳动日普遍少于中农社员。如衡山县万福乡第二社四月中旬统计，全社中农社员每个劳力平均已经得工分460分，贫农社员平均只得工分260分。浏阳县集里乡集里社六大队四小队从建社起，中农社员平均做了556分，贫农社员平均只做307分。这种现象在宁乡、望城、临湘、祁东等县都有。
    为什么中、贫农社员的工分相差这样大呢？主要是贫农社员在生产、生活上的困难得不到解决，不能经常出工。如衡山县横山乡祝融峰农业合作社，中农社员讥笑贫农社员为“三不能出工”，即晴天无锄头、耙头不能出工；雨天无蓑衣、?笠不能出工；无钱无粮不能出工。长沙县金溪乡贫农社员左桂南，在春耕生产中焦急地向社的领导人员说：我上田塍没有拖板，翻肥料没有耙，六天只出工半天。由于贫农社员缺钱、缺粮、缺农具不能出工，有些中农社员就说贫农社员做工是做零活。社内排工也是先中农后贫农。如宁乡县珍州农业合作社的贫农社员谢正坤，是出色的育秧能手，社里却分配他去收煤灰，而将育秧工夫排给没有经验的中农去做。
    这种情况如果不加以改变，贫农社员的经济困难问题就不能迅速解决，贫农的政治优势也不能真正树立起来，这势必影响农业合作社的巩固。因此，各地农业合作社应该对社员的出工情况普遍进行一次检查，迅速改变贫农社员出工过少的情况。对于生活有困难的社员，可以组织他们进行一些由社统一经营和由社员个人经营的副业生产。建立和健全预分制度，使生产困难的社员能通过预分解决眼前的生活问题。对缺乏小农具和雨具的社员，可以采取由社代做或调剂借用的办法给以帮助。对贫农社员的出工要合理安排，在不影响其他社员经常出工的原则下，应该优先分配给他们适当的农活，增加他们出工的机会。总之，要从各个方面帮助贫农社员多出工，帮助他们增加收入。
