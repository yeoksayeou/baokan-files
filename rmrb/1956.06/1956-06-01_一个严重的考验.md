    A Serious Test
    People of all countries have always considered the German people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland as an integral part of promoting the relaxation of international tensions and consolidating the cause of world peace. Therefore, all those who care about this cause cannot but sincerely welcome the eight-point proposal made by Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic to the West German government on May 29, aimed at easing internal German tensions. This is a new effort by the German Democratic Republic to promote all-German negotiations to achieve the peaceful reunification of Germany.
    For several years, the government of the German Democratic Republic has put forward dozens of positive initiatives to promote the normalization of relations between the two Germanys and to reach an all-German agreement. Because the West German government has consistently rejected these proposals, the two Germanys have failed to make contact to seek an easing of the internal German situation and to restore Germany's unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. However, each initiative of the German Democratic Republic and each rejection by the Adenauer government have made the German people increasingly aware of where the road to restoring the reunification of the motherland lies and what the obstacles on this road are. Prime Minister Grotewohl's eight new proposals were made at a time when the international situation was more conducive to a negotiated solution of the German question than ever before, and when there was also a more realistic foundation for it within Germany than in the past.
    At present, the international situation has eased considerably, the advocacy of war and the Cold War has been universally rejected, the idea of peaceful coexistence is gaining popularity, the policy of strength is being spurned, and the sentiment demanding a halt to the arms race and opposing military blocs is growing rapidly. Talks and contacts between countries to improve relations and increase trust are becoming more frequent, and relevant countries have made certain achievements in resolving some outstanding issues in Asia and Europe. This favorable development in the international situation provides very favorable conditions for achieving the peaceful reunification of Germany, and at the same time makes the issue of Germany's reunification even more pressing. Because it is easy for anyone to see that if the two Germanys take a step forward on the road to peaceful reunification, this will further ease the international situation and further guarantee the cause of world peace.
    Whether in terms of the international or German domestic situation, the West German government has no reason not to accept the sincere peace initiative recently put forward by the German Democratic Republic. May we ask: Since the leaders of countries with different social systems can openly resolve their differences through consultation, why can't the representatives of the two parts of what was originally one country sit down at a table to discuss the great plan of unification? Since the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have expressed their desire to reduce the military activities of this group, why should West Germany alone cling to the military obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? Since almost all countries now express their willingness to promote the realization of disarmament, why should West Germany stubbornly continue to take the harmful path of rearmament, adding a heavy burden to the West German people and increasing obstacles to the unification of Germany? The West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" is right in saying that the West German ruling clique "should adapt to the general trend as soon as possible and think carefully about what it can and should do to restore German unity under the new conditions." Going against the tide will not lead to good results.
    The recent sharp developments in the domestic situation in West Germany reflect the unprecedented degree to which the people of West Germany are demanding peaceful reunification. Now, the Adenauer group's policy of intensifying rearmament, which it is pursuing obstinately, is not only being met with increasingly fierce opposition from the broad masses of the people, but is also being met with increasingly fierce attacks from the opposition Social Democratic Party. It is not only being rejected by the Free Democratic Party, which was originally a partner in the Adenauer government coalition, but this policy is even causing growing discontent within Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Union. Not long ago, the Sixth Federal Congress of the Christian Democratic Union elected Arnold, whom Adenauer disliked, as the party's vice chairman. Recently, open disputes have arisen between Adenauer and two ministers of his government—Economics Minister Erhard and Finance Minister Schäffer—over economic policy. West German newspapers believe that Adenauer's government is facing the most serious political crisis since its founding in 1949.
    The eight new proposals recently put forward by the government of the German Democratic Republic are undoubtedly a serious test for the Adenauer government. These eight new proposals are both specific and practical. It proposes that the two Germanys not expand their armies and not become bases for atomic warfare. It calls on West Germany to implement democratization and prohibit activities that incite war and incite hatred among the people. It calls for the development of trade and cultural relations between the two Germanys and the promotion of contacts between the people of the East and West. The rationality and feasibility of these proposals are obvious. As long as the West German government accepts these proposals, it will be able to open up a road to reunifying Germany. For the benefit of all the German people and world peace, achieving the peaceful reunification of Germany through negotiation is not only the firm will of all the German people, but also the common aspiration of the people of the world. If the Adenauer government continues to stubbornly reject the hand of friendship extended once again by the government of the German Democratic Republic, this can only show that it disregards the fundamental interests of the German people, is willing to be a partner in the US policy of strength, and harms the interests of European security and world peace. Whoever does this will ultimately be rejected by the people.

### 一个严重的考验

    一个严重的考验
    各国人民一向都认为，德国人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争，是促进国际局势缓和和巩固世界和平事业中一个不可分割的部分。因此，凡是关心这个事业的人，都不能不衷心欢迎德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥五月二十九日向西德政府提出的缓和德国内部紧张局势的八点建议。这是民主德国为促成全德谈判以实现德国和平统一的新的努力。
    几年以来，德意志民主共和国政府为了促使两个德国关系的正常化并争取达成全德协议，曾经提出过数十次积极倡议。由于西德政府对这些建议一概采取拒绝的态度，因此两个德国之间始终未能进行接触，以谋求德国内部局势的缓和并在和平民主的基础上恢复德国的统一。但是，德意志民主共和国每一次倡议和阿登纳政府每一次拒绝，都使德国人民愈来愈认识到，恢复祖国统一的道路何在，在这条道路上的障碍是什么。格罗提渥总理这次提出八点新建议，是在国际局势比过去任何时候都更加有利于协商解决德国问题的时候，同时在德国国内也有了比过去更现实的基础。
    目前，国际局势已有了相当的缓和，战争和冷战的主张遭到了普遍的摈斥，和平共处的思想日益深入人心，实力政策受到唾弃，要求停止军备竞赛和反对军事集团的情绪迅速增长；国与国之间为改善关系、增进信任而进行的会谈和接触日益频繁，有关各国在解决亚洲和欧洲一些悬而未决问题方面有了一定的成就。国际局势的这种良好发展，给实现德国的和平统一提供了十分有利的条件，同时也使得德国恢复统一的问题显得更加迫切。因为任何人都很容易看得出，如果两个德国在走向和平统一的道路上迈前一步，这就将使国际局势进一步缓和下来，使世界和平事业得到进一步的保障。
    无论是就国际或德国国内局势来说，西德政府都没有任何理由不接受民主德国最近提出的诚恳的和平倡议。试问：既然不同社会制度的国家的领导人都可以开诚布公地通过协商来解决它们之间的分歧，为什么原来是一个国家的两部分的代表反而不能坐到一张桌子旁边来共商统一的大计呢？既然北大西洋集团的成员国都已经纷纷表示希望减少这个集团的军事活动，为什么唯独西德要死抱住北大西洋集团的军事义务呢？既然几乎所有的国家现在都表示愿意促成裁军的实现，为什么西德却要顽固地继续走重新武装的有害途径，为西德人民增加沉重负担，为德国的统一增加障碍呢？西德的“法兰克福新报”说得对：西德统治集团“应该尽快地适应总的潮流，好好想一想：在新的条件下，它可以而且应当为恢复德国统一做些什么。”逆流而行是不会有什么好结果的。
    西德国内局势最近的急剧发展，反映出了西德广大阶层人民要求和平统一的情绪空前高涨的程度。现在阿登纳集团一意孤行地加紧重新武装的政策，不仅受到广大人民愈来愈激烈的反对，不仅受到反对党社会民主党日益猛烈的抨击，也不仅为阿登纳政府联盟中原来的伙伴自由民主党所拒绝支持，这种政策甚至在阿登纳自己的基督教民主联盟内部也引起了日益增长的不满。不久以前，基督教民主联盟举行的第六次联邦代表大会选出了阿登纳所不喜欢的阿诺德为该党的副主席。阿登纳同他的政府的两个部长——经济部长艾哈德和财政部长谢菲尔之间，最近在经济政策上发生公开的争执。西德的报纸认为阿登纳的政府已经面临1949年成立以来最严重的政治危机。
    德意志民主共和国政府最近提出的八点新建议，对于阿登纳政府无疑是一个严重的考验。这八点新建议既具体而又切实可行。它主张两个德国不扩军，不成为原子战争的基地。它要求西德实行民主化，禁止煽动战争、挑拨人民仇恨的活动。它号召发展两个德国之间的贸易和文化关系，促进东西部人民的接触。这些建议的合理和切实可行，是十分明显的。西德政府只要接受了这些建议，就能够为重新统一德国开辟道路。为了全体德国人民和世界和平的利益，通过谈判来实现德国的和平统一，这不仅是全体德国人民的坚决意志，也是全世界人民的共同愿望。如果阿登纳政府仍固执地拒绝民主德国政府再一次伸出的友谊之手，这只能表明它不顾德国人民的根本利益，甘愿充当美国实力政策的伙伴，损害欧洲安全和世界和平的利益。谁这样做，谁最后就一定会遭到人民的唾弃。
