Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 4th: The Japanese House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution on June 2nd, demanding that the government hold negotiations with the United States to restore Japanese administrative rights over Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands as soon as possible.

The resolution stated that ten years after the end of the war, Okinawa Island is still under U.S. administration, and the 800,000 residents of Okinawa Island live in both spiritual and material suffering. This not only leads to frequent disregard for human rights, but also causes regret regarding the U.S. military's requisition of land for military use.

This resolution was jointly proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party of Japan. After the resolution was passed, Morishita Kunio, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, assured the House of Representatives that the Japanese government would make efforts in accordance with the House of Representatives' recommendation.

According to Japanese newspaper reports, the military land forcibly requisitioned by the United States in Okinawa accounts for 44% of the island's cultivated land area. When taking over the land, the U.S. military drove residents out of their homes with bayonets and destroyed their houses with road rollers. The island's residents often subsist on sweet potatoes and bean paste. Living conditions for residents are very poor; 30% of all dwellings are dilapidated tents that can be poked through with a finger, and 50% are thatched huts. Racial discrimination is also very serious in Okinawa, with very unequal treatment. For example, in wages paid in rice, white people rank first, while the people of Okinawa rank lowest. At the same time, U.S. soldiers frequently rape women and act lawlessly on the island.

Newspaper reports say that the residents of Okinawa eagerly hope that Okinawa Island will be returned to Japan.

    日本众议院一致通过决议
    要求早日收回冲绳岛和小笠原群岛的行政权
    美军统治下的冲绳岛人民生活在苦难中
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本国会众议院在六月二日一致通过决议，要求政府同美国举行谈判，早日恢复日本对冲绳岛和小笠原群岛的行政权。
    决议说，在战争结束已经十年的今天，冲绳岛仍然被置于美国的管理之下，八十万冲绳岛居民在精神方面和物质方面都生活在苦难之中。这不仅使人权往往受到忽视，而且在美军征用军用土地方面也令人感到遗憾。
    这个决议是日本自由民主党和社会党联合提出的。在通过这个决议以后，日本外务省政务次官森下国雄曾经向众议院保证说，日本政府将根据众议院的这个建议作出努力。
    据日本报纸报道，美国在冲绳岛强征的军用土地已经占到全岛耕地面积的44％。在接管土地的时候，美军用刺刀把居民赶出自己的家园，用压路机破坏他们的住宅。岛上居民经常以地瓜和豆酱来充饥。居民居住条件很坏，在全部住房中，有30％是可以用手指戳破的破旧帐篷，50％是茅草屋。在冲绳岛，种族歧视也非常严重，待遇很不平等。例如以大米支付的工资，白种人占第一位，而冲绳人占最低一位。同时，美军在岛上经常强奸妇女，胡作非为。
    报纸消息说，冲绳岛的居民热切地希望冲绳岛归还日本。
