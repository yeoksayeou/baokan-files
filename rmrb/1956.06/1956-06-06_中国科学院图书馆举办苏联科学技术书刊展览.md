The Chinese Academy of Sciences Library has held an exhibition of Soviet science and technology books and periodicals starting from the 4th.

The exhibited books and periodicals are a batch of very precious gifts recently presented by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to our Academy of Sciences, totaling 210 types of books with 224 volumes, and 109 types of periodicals with 1,830 volumes.

Among these two thousand scientific books and periodicals, some represent the latest achievements of Soviet science and technology. Among them, more than sixty books are devoted to automatic control, more than a dozen explain the construction and use of fast electronic computers, and there are many new publications on the peaceful use of atomic energy, as well as mining industry, mechanical industry, and other aspects. Another part is outdated periodicals that have played a role in the history of Russian and Soviet scientific development, such as the Journal of Moscow University from 1880, the bulletins of the Russian Geographical Society from the end of the 19th century, and magazines on physiology, chemical industry, and petroleum construction published in the Soviet Union 20 or 30 years ago. Many of these books and periodicals are unique to our country, and some are difficult to obtain even in the Soviet Union.

Also on display are some very valuable books and materials recently donated by several Soviet scientists. Among them are materials on the principles and uses of vacuum equipment donated by Academician Veksinsky. Corresponding Academician Budnikov donated his own work "Research and Use of Gypsum". This book was published in 1943 and has been out of print for a long time; he only has two copies himself.

    中国科学院图书馆举办苏联科学技术书刊展览
    本报讯　中国科学院图书馆四日起举办苏联科学技术书刊展览。
    展出的书刊，是苏联科学院最近赠送我国科学院的一批十分珍贵的礼物，共计图书210种224册，期刊109种1，830册。
    在这两千多册科学书刊中，有一部分代表着苏联科学技术的最新成就。其中有六十多种图书专讲自动控制，有十几种解释快速电子计算机的构造和使用方法，还有很多种关于和平利用原子能，以及关于采矿工业，机械工业等方面的最新出版物。另外一部分是在俄国和苏联科学发展史上起过作用的过期期刊。像1880年的莫斯科大学学报，十九世纪末叶的俄罗斯地理学会的会刊，以及二三十年以前苏联出版的生理学、化学工业、石油建筑等方面的杂志。这些书刊有很多种是我国从未有过的，有些在苏联也很难得到。
    同时展出的还有几位苏联科学家最近赠送的一些很宝贵的图书资料。其中有维克辛斯基院士赠送的有关真空设备原理和使用的资料。有布德尼科夫通讯院士赠送的他自己著作的“石膏的研究和使用”。这本书是1943年出版的，绝版已久，他自己也只有两本。
