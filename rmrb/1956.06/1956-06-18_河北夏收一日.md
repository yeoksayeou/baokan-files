Xinhua News Agency, Hebei:

    June 15th saw the weather change from sunny to overcast, making the summer harvest movement in Hebei Province, where a bumper wheat harvest has been widely reported, even more tense. On this day, across the vast Hebei Plain, red flags fluttered, songs rang out, and crowds were everywhere, rushing to harvest wheat and plant late crops. Hundreds of "iron oxen" from more than thirty tractor stations in An’guo, Gaocheng and other places were also pulling harvesters and seeders, running in the wheat fields, helping farmers to harvest wheat and plant late crops in a timely manner. Trucks and carts transporting wheat sped along the roads. In the threshing grounds, young men and women were busily threshing wheat.
    On the Central Hebei Plain, the farmers were particularly tense on this day, with almost all the labor force participating in wheat harvesting and summer planting. The 230,000 mu of wheat in the 29 agricultural production cooperatives of An’guo County were of particularly good quality, with an expected yield of more than 300 jin per mu, exceeding last year's yield by more than 50%. The cooperative members all said that not a single grain of such good wheat could be wasted. On the evening of June 14th, there was a rain shower, and people were worried that the ripe wheat would become damp, lose grains and sprout. The wheat harvesting team composed of more than 80,000 cooperative members in the county went to the fields before dawn on June 15th to rush the harvest. After breakfast, they harvested the 75,000 mu of wheat that was ready to be harvested. The people responsible for planting immediately rushed to plant late crops in 15,000 mu of wheat fields.
    On the plains south of Hebei, along the banks of the Zhang River and the Fu River, the summer harvest started earlier, and most of the wheat has been brought to the threshing floor. Members of the agricultural cooperatives are rushing to thresh, distribute, and plant late crops. On this day, June 15th, the threshing grounds of the agricultural cooperatives in the Handan area were particularly lively. The cooperative members were threshing in the drizzle, threshing and distributing as they went. Members of more than 1,500 agricultural cooperatives in the area have successively received new wheat. The original estimated yield per mu of wheat in the Fuyang Cooperative was 124 jin, but the actual yield was 150 jin. On June 15th, the cooperative members were conducting the eighth day of distribution. More than 2,000 households of cooperative members have received 500,000 jin of wheat. Li Genyin, a cooperative member who joined this year, received more than 800 jin of wheat, more than double the income when he was working independently last year.
    By June 15th, most of the wheat on both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Railway had been harvested and threshed. The wheat yields of many agricultural cooperatives here have been confirmed through actual harvesting and have achieved unprecedented harvests. In Xingtai County, more than 50 mu of wheat fields had a yield of more than 700 jin per mu. In Gaocheng County, more than 60 mu of wheat fields could produce 800 to 1,000 jin per mu. The 210,000 mu of wheat fields in this county had an average yield of 320 jin per mu. The cooperative members all said that this was an "180% harvest, a harvest that ancestors had never heard of." In this area, well irrigation is relatively developed. After the realization of full socialist collectivization, the farmers carried out a manure accumulation campaign, and the wheat fields received two or three times more fertilizer than in previous years. Coupled with timely hoeing and irrigation, the yield has increased unprecedentedly.
    The wheat on the west coast of Bohai Bay is also ripe. In the Tianjin area, where wheat fields account for one-fifth of the total cultivated land, the southern region has begun harvesting, and the northern region is also approaching ripeness. Farmers are actively preparing for the wheat harvest. In the Changzheng Agricultural Cooperative in Shuigaozhuang Village, Jinghai County, more than 200 semi-laborers were weaving mats at home on the 15th, preparing 1,200 mats for the wheat harvest.

    河北夏收一日
    六月十五日天气由晴变阴，小麦普告丰收的河北省的夏收运动更显得格外紧张。这一天，纵横千里的河北平原上，红旗飘扬，歌声嘹亮，遍地都是抢收小麦和抢种晚田的人群。安国、藁城等三十多个拖拉机站的几百头“铁牛”，也牵引着收割机、播种机奔跑在麦田里，帮着农民适时地收麦和播种晚田。拉运小麦的汽车、大车，在大路上飞驰。在打麦场上，年青的小伙子和姑娘们，正在紧张的为小麦脱粒。
    在冀中平原上，这一天农民们格外紧张，几乎所有的劳动力都参加了麦收和夏种。安国县二十九个农业生产合作社的二十三万多亩小麦成色特别好，预计每亩收麦三百多斤，超过去年五成多。社员们都说，这么好的麦子一粒也不能糟踏。六月十四日晚上下了一阵雨，人们耽心熟透了的麦子泛潮落粒生芽。全县八万多社员组成的收麦队，六月十五日天不明就下地抢收。吃罢早饭，便把该收的七万五千亩小麦收到家。负责播种的人们，也立刻在一万五千亩麦田里抢种上晚庄稼。
    在冀南平原漳河、滏阳河两岸，夏收动手较早，小麦大部都登场了，农业社社员们正在突击打场、分配和种晚田。在十五日这一天，邯郸专区各农业社的打麦场上格外热闹，社员们正冒着小雨打场，随打随分，全区一千五百多个农业社的社员都先后分得了新小麦。滏阳社的麦田原来估计亩产量是124斤，实打的结果是一百五十斤。六月十五日这天，社员们正进行第八天分配。两千多户社员已分得小麦五十万斤，今年刚入社的社员李根银分得小麦八百多斤，比去年单干时的收入增加一倍多。
    到六月十五日，京汉路两侧的小麦，大部分已经收打完毕。这里许多农业社的麦田产量，经过实打实收证实都获得了空前的收成。邢台县有五十多亩麦田亩产七百斤以上。藁城县有六十多亩麦田每亩能产八百斤到一千斤。这个县的二十一万亩麦田，平均亩产三百二十斤，社员们都说这是“十八成的年景，祖辈没听说过的收成”。这一带，水井灌溉比较发达，又加实现了全社会主义的合作化以后，农民们开展积肥运动，麦田比往年多追了两三倍的肥料，再加上适时锄、浇，产量便空前的增高了。
    渤海湾西岸的小麦也成熟了。麦田占全部耕地面积五分之一的天津专区，南部地区已经开始收割，北部地区也接近黄熟，农民们正积极进行麦收前的准备工作。静海县水高庄村长征农业社，在十五日这天，有二百多名半劳力在家编席，他们将为麦收准备好一千二百张席。
