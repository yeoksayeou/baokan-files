Inner Reasons for Commodity Stockpiling in Commercial Departments

    We fully agree with the basic spirit and specific allocation figures in Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget. However, we feel there is room for discussion regarding the analysis in the report about the commercial work not fulfilling the state plan. From our inspection of the processing fees and prices of joint public-private industries in Shanghai, we found that besides objective reasons, there are also internal factors in the commercial departments that contribute to commodity stockpiling. Based on what we saw in Shanghai, these are mainly manifested in the following two aspects:

    I. The stipulations for the quantity, variety, and quality of some commodities that commercial departments order from joint public-private factories for processing or direct purchase are not in line with actual needs, which easily leads to stockpiling. For example, the commercial department in Shanghai once ordered 1 million tubes of "Nose Clearer" from the Shanghai Joint Public-Private Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory. The factory负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) learned that this order was for export to Vietnam. As Vietnam is located in the tropics and not prone to colds and nasal congestion, they felt the order quantity was too large. They reported this to the ordering unit, which after consultation, cancelled the contract. This shows that the variety of the order was not suitable for actual needs. If the factory负责人 had not responsibly voiced their opinion, the state warehouse would have added "Nose Clearer" to its stockpiled commodities.

    Mechanical execution of policies can also cause stockpiling. For example, Shanghai has a type of bamboo-barreled ballpoint pen of poor quality that is not popular with the people. The factory suggested not ordering it anymore to avoid stockpiling. However, due to the commercial department mechanically implementing the State Council's instruction not to reduce the variety of goods during economic restructuring, they still arranged production. Although the quantity was reduced somewhat, it still led to stockpiling.

    Randomly changing specifications and lowering quality can also cause stockpiling. For example, starting in March 1954, when the Shanghai commercial department processed No. 190 Indanthrene cotton cloth at cotton cloth dyeing and printing factories, the Shanghai purchasing station of the flower yarn cloth company provided the factory with a prescription using the quota of materials for No. 180 Indanthrene, which meant that the main dye, Indanthrene blue, was reduced from 57 cm per piece to 45 cm. The processing fee was also correspondingly reduced from 11 yuan, 9 jiao, and 8 fen to 10 yuan and 3 jiao and 4 fen. Within a year and a half, the factory was notified to change the specifications four times, each time reducing the amount of materials. The main dye, Indanthrene blue, was eventually reduced to 35 cm. The processing fee was also reduced each time, eventually reaching 7 yuan and 9 jiao. This aroused many consumer complaints, who felt the color was too light. A year later, the flower yarn cloth company wanted the dyeing and printing factories to increase the amount of Indanthrene navy blue by 1.2 cm to meet the people's opinions, but the resulting dyed color was not vibrant, and the people still had complaints. It was not until the beginning of 1956, when the anti-one-sided economy campaign began, that No. 190 Indanthrene was restored to the original prescription (the processing fee remained at 7 yuan and 9 jiao). One-sided economy that disregards quality not only incurs the dissatisfaction of the people but also causes stockpiling.

    II. Commercial departments cause commodity stockpiling through untimely supply during sales; simplistic averaging of colors and varieties, failing to adapt to the different preferences and habits of people in different regions; lack of understanding of commodity performance; and inappropriate pricing of commodities. For example, in Shanghai, seasonal commodities such as flannelette for winter and mosquito coils, fans, and mosquito nets for summer were in short supply when they were in season, resulting in out-of-stock situations. After the season, large quantities were supplied, leading to slow sales and stockpiling. This phenomenon of untimely supply occurs every year. Furthermore, the needs of the people in the central, factory, and suburban areas of Shanghai for commodities, whether in terms of color or quality, are not entirely the same. However, the commercial departments adopt a simplistic averaging approach to matching colors and varieties for wholesale stations, resulting in each district being the same, failing to adapt to the sales characteristics of different regions. As a result, one place is out of stock, while another is stockpiling. The wholesale system is also rigid, with wholesale stations not allowed to exchange goods or make adjustments between themselves. Many seasonal goods are stockpiled due to the failure to adapt the supply to the different requirements of different regions. Another example is an imported dye called "Direct Red X" at the Shanghai Purchasing Station of the Chemical Raw Materials Company, which is used for dyeing wool fabrics. However, because the commercial department did not know its performance and thought it was used for dyeing cotton cloth, they promoted it to cotton cloth dyeing and printing factories. When the cotton cloth dyeing and printing factories found it unsuitable, the Shanghai commercial department treated it as a defective product and sold it off at a reduced price. As a result of the discounted sale, cotton cloth dyeing and printing factories had no choice but to stockpile it in warehouses. Since the quantity sold at a discount was limited, the state warehouse still had stockpiles. Another example is An'an Blue, a dye successfully trial-produced by the dye industry. The commercial profit added was too high, reaching 370 yuan per dan (with an industrial profit of 76 yuan per dan), exceeding the price of imported goods. The industrial department was unwilling to use it, which also led to stockpiling.

    Although the commodity stockpiling caused by the commercial department's inability to meet actual needs in ordering and sales that we have seen in the Shanghai area is only a situation in one corner of Shanghai, it already shows that commodity stockpiling in commercial departments is not only due to objective reasons, but also due to certain subjective problems. Although the examples we have cited above are individual, the problem is that there are too many individual examples. This is the basis for our opinion that there is room for discussion in the analysis in the report regarding the commercial work not fulfilling the state plan. However, we certainly say that our views are incomplete and are only for the reference of the responsible comrades of the State Council.

Low Processing Fees and Prices in Joint Public-Private Industries

    In addition, the 1956 budget revenue includes an increase of 21.06% in income tax from industry and commerce compared to 1955, totaling 1,101.4 million yuan. For joint public-private enterprises, the method of using revenue to offset expenditure is adopted. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, 200 million yuan is turned over to the state. The state's investment in joint enterprises is 600 million yuan, which is offset in the revenue and not included in the state budget. The fixed interest for joint public-private enterprises, according to Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech, is an annual interest rate of 5%, and the private share capital of joint public-private industries nationwide is estimated at 3.3 billion yuan, requiring a fixed interest payment of 165 million yuan. This is also offset in the revenue. The sum of these four expenditures is 2,042.64 million yuan. This means that joint public-private enterprises nationwide must have at least 2 billion yuan in profit income this year to complete this part of the fiscal budget plan. However, based on our inspection of the processing fees and prices of joint public-private industries in Shanghai, it seems that there are still certain problems in completing this part of the fiscal budget based on the current processing fees and price income of joint public-private industries.

    The main reason is that the processing fees and prices approved by the Shanghai commercial department for joint public-private industries in processing orders are generally low, specifically manifested in the following aspects:

    I. The standard for approving processing fees and prices is, in principle, based on the intermediate standard of "encouraging the advanced and leading the backward" as instructed by the central government, but in reality, it is the advanced standard, and there are no rewards for advanced experience. If a factory has technical improvements and reduces costs, the commercial department will reduce the processing fees for the entire industry accordingly, which affects the enthusiasm of many factories for improving technology. In some cases, the reduction in processing fees exceeds the benefits obtained from technical improvements, resulting in losses. For example, the production task of the Kai Mei Ke Pharmaceutical Factory has doubled this year, but the consumption of raw materials has only increased by 50%, indicating that the saving of raw materials has been very successful. However, the processing fees were also immediately reduced, and the reduction exceeded the gains from saving raw materials, so the Kai Mei Ke Pharmaceutical Factory is losing money this year. This kind of excessively low processing fees, which exceeds the method of "cutting leeks," affects production enthusiasm. The workers of one factory reflected, "The result of our labor competition is a loss."

    II. It is appropriate to reduce processing fees when raw material prices fall. However, when raw material prices rise, processing fees do not increase accordingly. For example, the processing fee for manufacturing medicine for schistosomiasis is based on a raw material price of 16 yuan per kilogram. Now that the raw material has risen to 53 yuan per kilogram, the processing fee has not been adjusted accordingly.

    III. The approved processing fees are calculated based on normal operating rates. When production tasks are reduced and costs increase, the processing fees are not increased accordingly. However, when the task increases again, the processing fees are immediately reduced.

    IV. The basis for approving processing fees and prices is based on the income calculated by the tax bureau. The surplus calculated by the tax bureau is higher than the actual surplus of the factory, so the calculation of processing fees and prices nominally has a profit, but in reality, the profit is very small, or there is no profit, or even a loss. State-owned commercial companies and state-owned industrial companies often have many disputes over the calculation of processing fees and prices for joint public-private industries. The commercial company says there is a profit, while the industrial company says there is no profit, and this is the reason.

    V. There are also differences between commercial departments and factories on the acceptance standards for goods and the issue of penalties for returned goods. The main reason is the lack of acceptance standards and measuring instruments and equipment. Acceptance is highly subjective, and there is also a phenomenon of lenient acceptance during peak season and strict acceptance during off-season. In particular, commercial departments focus on appearance, while industrial departments focus on physical properties, so there are more disputes over returned goods. If the raw materials are supplied by the commercial department, and defective products are caused due to substandard raw materials, the factory still has to bear the loss of depreciation of the defective products. If the supply of raw materials is not timely, causing a delay in delivery, the factory still has to pay a penalty of one to three per thousand of the value of the goods per day. The difference in depreciation of defective products and the penalty for delayed delivery are staggering. For example, the total surplus of 39 factories in the printing and dyeing industry from January to April this year was more than 260,000 yuan, but the expenditure on the difference in defective cloth reached more than 560,000 yuan. After offsetting the two, there is a loss. A large part of the reason for the defective cloth is due to the raw material base cloth not meeting the printing and dyeing specifications. Taking Wanfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory as an example, out of the more than 25,000 yuan of defective cloth difference expenditure, more than 10,000 yuan was due to the raw material base cloth not meeting the specifications. However, this loss of defective cloth due to the raw material base cloth not meeting the specifications is not borne by the commercial department that supplies the raw materials but by the factory.

    According to the reflections of some state-owned industrial professional companies, joint public-private industries do not have the ability to pay fixed interest, and they do not even have the ability to improve labor protection equipment. Taking the dye industry as an example, in the first half of this year, the total surplus of the entire industry was more than 260,000 yuan, while the funds needed to improve labor equipment in the entire industry amounted to 1.24 million yuan. After private enterprises become joint public-private, the enthusiasm of workers is greatly improved, but the labor conditions in production cannot be improved accordingly, and everything is the same as in the private period. The wages and welfare of the workers cannot be improved, of course, and there are no certain material conditions to support the labor enthusiasm of the workers. Such enthusiasm cannot last.

    Based on our inspection of the processing fees and prices of joint public-private industries, we feel that the profits of joint public-private industries this year are lower than last year, so there are certain problems in completing the state's budget plan. However, we fully agree with the principle of adopting the method of using revenue to offset expenditure for joint public-private industries as proposed by Vice Premier Li Xiannian in his report. We believe that the management method of commercial departments towards joint enterprises should be changed to ensure the realization of this part of the state budget in 1956. Because the way commercial departments manage joint public-private industries today is not only a question of whether the fiscal budget can be implemented but also a question of whether the relations of production are adapted to the productive forces. If the management method of commercial departments towards joint public-private industries is not changed, the impact will hinder the transformation and development of production in joint public-private enterprises.

    We should affirm that commercial departments have made significant contributions to stabilizing prices and meeting the needs of national construction and people's lives since liberation, especially in implementing the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of private industry and commerce. However, private industry and commerce nationwide have entered the advanced form of state capitalism of joint public-private, and the nature of enterprises has undergone fundamental changes. In particular, after the adoption of fixed interest, the production and operation of joint enterprises can be managed in the same way as state-owned enterprises. With such a fundamental and huge change in China's economic foundation, if commercial work remains in the past way, it will inevitably conflict with the new situation. This contradiction also affects the implementation of the state budget plan. To overcome this contradiction, we put forward the following three suggestions:

Three Suggestions

    I. Change the current profit distribution situation between commercial departments and joint enterprises. At present, the commercial profits and the profits of joint enterprises are very different. One or two examples can illustrate the general situation. For example, the cost of each catty of glucose is 5 jiao and 9 fen, and the ex-factory price is 6 jiao and 2 fen, so the industrial profit is 3 fen RMB. The selling price is 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 9 fen, and the commercial profit is 9 jiao and 7 fen RMB. The ratio of industrial profit to commercial profit is one to thirty-two. For example, the industrial profit of Huafu's Yijin steel pen is 1.22% of the unit cost, and the commercial profit is 22% of the unit cost, which is a ratio of one to nineteen. According to the commodities we came into contact with during our inspection, generally speaking, the margin of commercial profit higher than industrial profit is very large. If commercial profits are too high, it is not easy to actively accelerate the turnover of goods, which can easily lead to stockpiling and easily conceal the shortcomings of commercial work. If industrial profits are too low, there are no conditions to improve production equipment and improve technology, and there is no possibility to improve labor conditions and living welfare, which will affect the reform and transformation of joint enterprises and will affect the labor enthusiasm of workers. After joint public-private industries adopt fixed interest, the excess profit can still be turned over, so today, reallocating the ratio of industrial and commercial profits is not a problem of industrial and commercial competition for profits but a problem of appropriately transferring the link of state accumulation funds to accelerate the turnover of goods and exert the enthusiasm of industrial production. It is beneficial to both commerce and industry to appropriately transfer state accumulation funds from the commercial aspect to the industrial aspect. Therefore, we suggest that this issue should be handled with reference to the ratio standards of state-owned factories and commercial departments.

    II. The production of industry and the sales of commerce must be divided. At present, the production of joint enterprises is managed by commercial departments. For example, the Shanghai Third Commercial Bureau has to manage the production work of processing and ordering 37,000 kinds of commodities, and it also has to manage its main business, which is the wholesale of goods nationwide. It is difficult to improve the quality of work with such a large workload and such complex work content concentrated in one institution. As a result, both production and sales are not well managed. Now, industrial professional companies have been established line by line and industry by industry according to the product types of joint public-private industries. Commercial departments are already in a position to transfer the work of managing the production of joint public-private industries, including assigning tasks, approving processing fees and prices, and inspecting quality, to industrial professional companies. However, during our inspection, we felt that the commercial department emphasized that the conditions for industrial professional companies are not yet mature and that a few years of transition are needed, which is a bit "difficult to give up." The industrial professional company wants to take it over but is afraid of not being able to handle it, which is a bit "half-pushed and half-consented." We believe that as long as the industrial professional company is determined and the commercial professional company is willing to support it, it is possible to carry out the division of labor now.

    III. Strengthen the consultation and mutual supervision between the public of commerce and industry, and strengthen the consultation and connection between the public and private parties, so as to unify understanding, coordinate relations, improve work, and closely link the production of industry with the sales of commerce, so as to give play to positive roles for national construction, for the needs of the people, and for the completion of the state budget.

    Finally, we know that the situation is limited to one region, and there is an inevitable one-sidedness. Therefore, the opinions provided are also not very mature, and we hope that all representatives will criticize and correct us.

    在视察公私合营工业中发现的问题
    ——王性尧　刘靖基　荣毅仁　胡子婴　胡厥文　郭棣活　汤蒂因　魏　如八位代表的联合发言商业部门商品积压的内在原因
    我们完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算报告的基本精神和分配的具体数字。但是对于报告中商业工作没有完成国家计划的分析，似乎还有商榷之处。从我们视察上海公私合营工业的工缴货价情况时，发现商品的积压，除了客观的原因之外，还有商业部门内在的因素。根据我们在上海所看到的，主要表现在下列两个方面：
    一、商业部门向公私合营工厂加工、定货的有些商品，对数量、品种、质量的规定，有不合于实际需要的情况，因此很容易造成积压。例如上海的商业部门曾经向上海公私合营信谊药厂定购“鼻通”100万枝，厂方负责人了解这一项定货，是向越南出口的，越南地处热带，不易得伤风鼻塞的病症，觉得定货数量太多，就向定货单位反映，定货单位经过请示，取消了定货合同。这就说明定货的品种，不适合于实际需要，如果没有工厂负责人的负责反映意见，国家仓库里又将增加“鼻通”的积压商品。
    机械地执行政策，也会造成积压。例如：上海有一种竹杆原子笔，品质低劣，不为人民所喜爱，工厂方面曾经建议不要再定货，免得积压，但是由于商业部门机械地执行国务院对于在经济改组时不要减少花色品种的指示，还是布置生产，虽然在数量上减少了一些，但是还是要积压的。
    随便改变规格，降低质量，也会造成积压。例如1954年3月份开始，上海商业部门向棉布印染厂加工190号阴丹士林，花纱布公司上海采购站向工厂提供的处方，是用180号阴丹士林的用料定额，也就是说主要染料士林蓝，由每匹57公分减少到45公分。工缴也相应地由十一元九角八分减至十元零三角四分。一年半之内竟通知厂方改变规格四次之多，每次降低用料；直到主要染料士林蓝降低到35公分。工缴也每次降低，一直降低到七元九角。引起消费者很多意见，嫌颜色太浅，一年之后，花纱布公司要印染厂增加1.2公分的士林藏青，以应付人民的意见，但结果印染的颜色不鲜艳，人民仍有意见。到1956年年初反片面节约开始，190号阴丹士林，才恢复了原来的处方（工缴仍是七元九角）。不顾品质的片面节约，不仅会遭到人民的不满，而且会造成积压。
    二、商业部门在销售商品时，供应不及时；搭配花色品种采取简单化的平均主义，不能适应不同地区人民的不同喜爱习惯；不了解商品的性能；商品价格定得不适宜等等，都会造成商品的积压。例如：在上海曾经发生这样的情况，应销冬令的绒布，应销夏令的蚊香、扇子、帐子等时令商品，在当令时供应少，发生脱销现象，过令后大量供应，又发生滞销积压现象。这样供应不及时的现象年年发生。又如上海市中心区、工厂区、郊区，人民对商品的需要方面，无论花色、质量，都不尽相同，但商业部门对批发站的搭配花色品种是简单的平均主义，各区一律，不能适应地区的销售特性，结果是彼处脱销，此处积压，批发制度又呆板，批发站与批发站之间，不许互通有无，相互调剂，许多时令货就这样供应不适应地区的不同要求而造成积压。又如化学原料公司上海采购站里有一种进口货染料叫“直接红X”，是染羊毛织品的，但由于商业部门不知道它的性能，以为是染棉布的，向棉布印染厂推销，棉布印染厂不适用，上海的商业部门就将它当次品处理，削价搭销，搭销的结果，棉布印染厂只好积压在仓库。搭销数量有限，国家的仓库里还是有积压。又如染料工业试制成功的安安蓝，商业利润加得太多，每担有370元（工业利润每担76元），超过了进口货的价格，工业部门不愿意采用，也会造成积压。
    我们从上海地区所看到的商业部门在定货和销售方面不能适合实际需要所造成的商品积压，虽然只是上海一隅的情况，但已经说明商业部门的商品积压，不仅是客观的原因，主观上也存在着一定问题。我们上面所举的例子虽然是个别的，但问题在于个别的例子太多，这就是我们认为在报告中对商业工作不能完成国家计划的分析有商榷之处的根据，但肯定说我们的看法是不全面的，谨供国务院负责同志的参考。公私合营工业的工缴货价偏低
    此外，1956年预算收入部分关于工商业所得税收入比1955年增加21.06％，总数为110，140万元。对于公私合营企业，采取以收抵支的办法。收支相抵后，向国家上缴2亿元。国家对合营企业的投资是6亿元，这笔数字在收入中抵支，不列入国家预算。公私合营企业的定息，根据陈云副总理的发言为年息5厘，全国公私合营工业私股资本，以33亿计，定息须支付16，500万元。也在收入中抵支。这样四笔支付的数字加起来的总数是204，264万元。也就是说，全国的公私合营企业，今年至少要有20亿多的利润收入，才能完成这一部分的财政预算计划。但根据我们在上海视察公私合营工业的工缴货价情况，公私合营工业根据目前的工缴货价收入，要完成这一部分的财政预算，似乎还存在一定问题。
    主要是上海的商业部门对公私合营工业在加工定货方面，核定的工缴货价一般是偏低的，具体表现在下列几个方面。
    一、核定工缴货价的标准，原则上是根据中央指示的鼓励先进、带动落后的中等标准，但实际上是先进标准，而且对先进经验也不加奖励。那一个工厂有了技术改进，降低了成本，商业部门对全行业的工缴就跟着降低，影响了许多工厂对改进技术的积极性。有的工缴降低的幅度，超过了从改进技术中所得的利益，反而亏了本。如开美科药厂，今年生产任务增加了一倍，耗用原料只增加了50％，说明节约原料成绩很好。但工缴也立刻降低了，降低的幅度超过了节约原料的所得，所以开美科药厂今年是亏本的。这样超过了割韭菜方式的核低工缴，影响了生产积极性，有一个工厂的工人们反映“我们搞劳动竞赛的结果，却得到了亏本的后果”。
    二、原料价钱跌了，工缴也跟着核低，这是应该的。但是原料价格涨了，工缴却不跟着提高。例如制造医治血吸虫病的药，工缴是照原料16元一公斤来核的，现在原料涨到53元一公斤，工缴没有相应的调高。
    三、核定工缴是照正常开工率计算的，生产任务减少成本增加，工缴不作相应的提高，如果任务再增加时，工缴就立刻降低。
    四、核定工缴货价的基础，是根据税局计算所得额的基础，税局计算的盈余高于工厂实际的盈余，因此工缴货价的计算，名是有利润，实际利润很少，或者没有利润，甚至是亏本的。国营的商业公司和国营的工业公司，对计算公私合营工业的工缴货价问题，争执很多，商业公司说有利润，工业公司说没有利润，原因即在此。
    五、商业部门和工厂之间，对商品的验收标准和退货罚款问题，也存在着分歧。主要由于没有验收标准，没有测定的仪器设备。验收带着很大的主观性，也有发生旺季验收宽，淡季验收严的现象。特别是商业部门注重外观，工业部门注重物理性能，因此在退货问题上争执更多。原料由商业部门供应，由于原料不合规格而造成次品，次品贬价的损失，仍要工厂负担。原料供应不及时，造成延期交货，工厂仍要交纳每天货价千分之一到千分之三的罚款，这种次品贬值的差金和延期交货的罚款，数字是很惊人的。如印染工业39个工厂，今年1至4月份盈余总额是26万多元，次布差金支出达56万多元。两抵之后是要亏蚀的。造成次布的原因中，有很大部分是由于原料胚布不合印染规格所造成，以万丰印染厂为例，次布差金支出25，000多元中，有1万多元是属于原料胚布不合规格所致。但是这种由于原料胚布不合规格所致的次布损失，却不是供应原料的商业部门来负担，而是由工厂来负担。
    根据有些国营工业专业公司反映，公私合营工业没有能力支付定息，连改善劳动保护设备的能力也没有，以染料工业来说，今年上半年，全业盈余26万多元，而全业需要改善劳动设备的资金却需要124万元。私营企业公私合营之后，工人积极性大大提高，但生产中的劳动条件不能相应的提高，一切和私营时期没有两样，工人的工资福利，当然也无法改善，没有一定的物质条件来支持工人的劳动积极性。这样的积极性是不能持久的。
    根据我们视察公私合营工业工缴货价的情况，感到今年公私合营工业的利润比去年低，因此要完成国家的预算计划，是存在一定问题的。但我们是完全赞成李先念副总理在报告中提出的对公私合营工业采取以收抵支的原则。我们认为应该改变商业部门对合营工业的管理方式，来保证1956年国家对这一部分预算的实现。因为根据今天商业部门管理公私合营工业的方式，不仅是能否保证财政预算的贯彻问题，同时关系到生产关系与生产力能否相适应的问题。如果不改变商业部门对公私合营工业的管理方式，影响所及，会阻碍公私合营企业的改造与生产的发展。
    我们应该肯定商业部门自从解放以来，对稳定物价，供应国家建设和人民生活需要方面有重大贡献，尤其对私营工商业贯彻利用、限制、改造政策，发挥了巨大的作用。但是全国范围的私营工商业已经进入了公私合营的国家资本主义高级形式，企业的性质，发生了根本变化，特别是采取定息之后，合营企业的生产经营，已经有条件可以按照国营企业的方式来管理。我国的经济基础发生这样根本的巨大的变化，商业工作依然停留在过去的方式上，必然会和新的形势发生矛盾。这一矛盾，也影响到国家预算计划的贯彻。为了克服这一矛盾，我们提出下列三点建议：三点建议
    一、改变目前商业部门和合营工业之间的利润分配情况。目前商业利润和合营工业的利润相距很大，举一、二个例子，就可以说明一般。如葡萄糖每斤成本五角九分，出厂价格六角二分，工业利润是人民币三分。售价一元五角九分，商业利润是人民币九角七分。工业与商业的利润是一与三十二之比。如华孚的依金钢笔，工业利润是单位成本的1.22％，商业利润为单位成本的22％，是一与十九之比。据我们视察中所接触到的商品，一般的说，商业利润高于工业利润的幅度是很大的。商业利润过分大了，就不易积极去加速商品的周转，容易造成积压，容易掩盖商业工作的缺点。工业利润过分低了，没有条件改善生产设备和改进技术，没有可能改善劳动条件和生活福利，将影响合营工业的改革改造，将影响工人的劳动积极性。公私合营工业采取定息之后，多余的利润，一样可以上缴，因此今天重新分配工业与商业的利润比例，在性质上，已经不是工商争利问题，而是为了加速商品周转，发挥工业生产的积极性而适当转移国家积累资金的环节问题。国家积累资金，由商业方面适当的转移到工业方面，对商业和工业都有利。因此，我们建议应该参照国营工厂和商业部门的比例标准，来处理这一问题。
    二、工业的生产与商业的销售，必须分工。目前合营工业的生产是由商业部门来管理的。像上海第三商业局，要管37，000种商品的加工、定货的生产工作，还要管理它的主要业务就是对全国的商品批发工作，这样庞大的工作量，这样复杂的工作内容，集中在一个机构中，要提高工作质量，事实上有困难，其结果，必然是生产与销售两者都管不好。现在工业的专业公司，已经按照公私合营工业的产品种类，一行一业的成立起来了，商业部门已经有条件可以将管理公私合营工业生产的工作，包括分配任务，核定工缴货价，检验品质等移交给工业专业公司。但是我们在视察中感到商业部门对于交出这件工作，强调工业专业公司条件尚未成熟，需要几年过渡，有点“难舍难分”。工业专业公司想接过来，又怕吃勿落，有点“半推半就”。我们认为只要工业专业公司有决心，商业专业公司肯支持，现在就进行分工，是有可能的。
    三、加强商业与工业的公公之间的协商，和相互之间的监督，加强公方与私方的协商和联系，以统一认识，协调关系，提高工作，使工业的生产与商业的销售密切衔接起来，为国家建设，为人民需要，为完成国家预算，发挥积极作用。
    最后，我们知道的情况，局限于一个地区，存在着不可避免的片面性。因此提供的意见也是不很成熟的，希望各位代表批评指教。
