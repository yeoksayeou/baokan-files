Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 24th. Entrusted by the Chinese government, the Chinese Red Cross today in Tianjin handed over 335 Japanese war criminals exempted from prosecution, including Kaminaka Masataka and Oya Masaharu, to representatives of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council.

    The handover ceremony was held at 10:00 AM. Zhao Anbo, advisor to the Chinese Red Cross, read the handover certificate. Among the 335 released Japanese war criminals, 318 were healthy, and 17 were ill, including 15 with minor illnesses and 2 with serious illnesses. The sick are continuing to receive treatment in hospitals and sanatoriums in Tianjin.

    Signing the handover certificate on the Chinese side were Zhao Anbo, Peng Yan, Ni Feijun, Ji Feng, Wu Shifa, and Xue Hua, representatives of the Chinese Red Cross. On the Japanese side were Inoue Masutaro, Nagano Juemon, Abe Yukizo, Okada Koji, Hata Michiyoshi, Ikeda Toshiko, Nakajima Toshishige, Kiuchi Risaburo, Matsui Matsuji, and Nakahara Junkichi, representatives of the three groups.

    After the ceremony, representatives of the three Japanese groups, accompanied by representatives of the Chinese Red Cross, met with the released Japanese war criminals. The released war criminals eagerly expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people to the representatives of the three Japanese groups. Kumitomo Shuntaro said with tears in his eyes to the representatives: We are grateful for the leniency of the Chinese people. The war of aggression brought misfortune to everyone. We don't want war anymore; we want a happy life. Yamane Hideo said: The people of China and Japan should join hands to live in friendship and peace. This is the real interest of the Japanese people. Abe Yukizo, representative of the Japan Peace Liaison Council, told them that the Japanese people are now working hard to demand peace and oppose atomic bombs.

    This afternoon, some representatives of the three Japanese groups went to the Anti-Japanese Martyrs Memorial Hall to offer a silent tribute to the Chinese anti-Japanese martyrs.
