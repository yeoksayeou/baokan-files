Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 7th. Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti told a correspondent from the Polish "People's Tribune" in Rome that the results of the recent Italian local elections indicate that a significant leftward trend has emerged in Italy. The period of political monopoly by the Christian Democratic Party is over, and a new era is beginning.

The "People's Tribune" published Togliatti's remarks on June 6th.

Togliatti said that the results of the election are that the Communists have firmly maintained their position, and the Socialists have increased their votes. He said that if all soldiers were allowed to vote, and if hundreds of thousands of working people were not deprived of their right to vote through various pretexts, the leftward trend would be even more obvious. Togliatti pointed out that the alliance of bourgeois right-wing parties put forward an aggressive and reactionary program in the election, and as a result, they were defeated. The Christian Democratic Party, despite receiving more open support from the Church than before, was unable to stop the formation of the leftward trend.

He said that in the new period that has begun after the election, the political situation will no longer be static, but will be more conducive to implementing changes and to those who want to move forward. Togliatti said: "I believe that although there are still difficulties now, it will be possible to take the first steps that we have long been waiting for in the direction of strengthening our country's democracy and carrying out major social reforms."

    意大利出现了向左转的重要趋势
    —陶里亚蒂谈地方选举结果—
    新华社华沙7日电　意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂对波兰“人民论坛报”驻罗马记者说，最近举行的意大利地方选举的结果表明，在意大利出现了向左转的重要趋势。天主教民主党的政治垄断时期已经结束，一个新时期正在开始。
    “人民论坛报”在六月六日刊载了陶里亚蒂的谈话。
    陶里亚蒂说，这次选举的结果是，共产党人巩固地保持了自己的阵地，社会党人得到的票数增加了。他说，如果让全体士兵都参加投票，如果不用各种借口剥夺掉几十万劳动人民的选举权，那么向左转的趋势还会更加明显。陶里亚蒂指出，资产阶级右翼党派的联盟在选举中提出了侵略性的反动纲领，结果他们遭到了失败。天主教民主党尽管得到了教会方面比以前更为公开的支持，也没有能阻挡左倾趋势的形成。
    他说，在选举以后开始的新时期里，政治局势将不再一成不变，而是将更有利于实行变革，有利于那些想往前走的人。陶里亚蒂说：“我相信，现在虽然还有困难，但是将有可能朝着加强我国民主、进行巨大的社会改革这一方向，迈开我们早就期待着的第一步。”
