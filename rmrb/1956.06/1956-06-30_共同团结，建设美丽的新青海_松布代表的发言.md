I fully agree with the three reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen at this conference. These reports are gratifying to see that in the past year, our country has made great achievements in various aspects of construction; what is particularly exciting is that the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in 1955 brought our country into a new stage of construction. It has enabled people of all ethnic groups across the country to march in unison toward the ranks of productive construction for the joyous labor of completing and overfulfilling our country's first five-year plan ahead of schedule, and for their own happy future.

I am a representative of the Tu ethnic group among the ethnic minorities in Qinghai Province. The vast majority of our Tu people are engaged in agricultural production and believe in Buddhism. Before liberation, like other ethnic minorities across the country, we suffered ruthless oppression, exploitation, and discrimination under the cruel and dark rule of the reactionaries. We had no rights in political and economic life other than being enslaved; our religious life was constantly undermined. Everyone can imagine the unforgettable and painful life imposed on the Tu people by the old society in general, without listing the facts. After liberation, under the brilliant light of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's policies of equality, unity, and freedom of religious belief, we, the Tu people, like other ethnic minorities across the country, have been treated equally; at the same time, under the care, love, and correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we have enjoyed the warmth of the motherland's big family. In politics, an unprecedented ethnic autonomous regime—the Mutual Assistance Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province—has been established, ensuring that the people of this ethnic group can be masters of their own affairs and manage the internal affairs of their own ethnic group. Many Tu youths have joined the workforce, and under the leadership of Party and government organs, they are wholeheartedly serving the people. When the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement swept the country last year, the Tu people also joined this movement. They organized and joined agricultural production cooperatives together with farmers of other fraternal ethnic groups; and most of the cooperatives were composed of members of several ethnic groups (Tu, Tibetan, Hui, Han, etc.). Although they have different customs, religious beliefs, and farming methods, the most important point is that they have a common desire and goal to move towards a happy socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party. Based on this common desire and goal, they are carrying out common labor with the spirit of mutual respect for customs, religious beliefs, mutual assistance and cooperation, and unity and friendship, to produce more grain, support the country's industrial construction, and explore and develop the Qaidam Basin. The emergence of this new ethnic relationship is only possible under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

I am a religious person. We deeply appreciate that the Party and the People's Government have consistently protected temples, respected the religious beliefs of the people, and cared for and taken into account the characteristics of religious personnel in various social reforms and construction work, and have carried out a series of work. Therefore, the lives of religious personnel have also improved with the development of production and the improvement of the people's lives. For example, in recent years, the number of people who come to our temple to chant scriptures and give alms has increased year by year. This is a good situation, indicating that the policy of freedom of religious belief has penetrated people's hearts. However, since the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, some people have developed some new doubts and concerns due to insufficient understanding of the permanence of the policy of freedom of religious belief and some cadres' insufficient respect for the religious activities and customs of ethnic minorities, coupled with the opportunity for bad elements to spread rumors and sabotage. For example, they say that after cooperation, "property is no longer one's own" and "belief is no longer one's own," and so on. There are also some people who are backward because they are unwilling to learn and understand too few new things. Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to further carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work in the future; in particular, through some specific examples, to educate religious personnel of ethnic minorities to continue to improve their ideological understanding, love the motherland, strongly support the country's socialist construction cause, and actively support and promote the continuous progress and development of their ethnic group. At the same time, they should also be educated to continue to distinguish between enemies and friends, and always be vigilant against the conspiracies and traps of hidden enemies. In this way, we will not allow ourselves to be used by the enemy and become obstacles on the road of progress for the people. It is the responsibility of Han cadres to help educate backward people, but more importantly, cadres of their own ethnic group are more responsible for actively and patiently helping because they are familiar with the language and customs. Cadres working in ethnic minority areas should also be educated to become more familiar with and correctly implement the policy of freedom of religious belief and various ethnic policies, and pay attention to respecting the customs of ethnic minorities, so as to consolidate and unite together to build our beautiful new Qinghai. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, people of all ethnic groups continue to advance on the bright road of socialism.

### 共同团结，建设美丽的新青海——松布代表的发言

    共同团结，建设美丽的新青海
    ——松布代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长在这次会议上的三项报告。这些报告使人满意地看到：在过去的一年中，我国各方面的建设又取得了巨大的成就；特别使人兴奋的是：1955年的农业合作化运动的高潮把我国带进了新的建设阶段。它使全国各族人民齐步走向为提前和超额完成我国的第一个五年计划，为自己幸福的未来而进行愉快的劳动的生产建设行列之中了。
    我是青海省少数民族中的土族代表。我们土族人民，绝大多数人从事农业生产，信仰佛教。解放前，我们跟全国其他少数民族人民一样，在反动派残酷的黑暗统治下，遭受着无情的压迫、剥削和歧视。我们在政治和经济生活中除了被人奴役，没有任何权利；我们的宗教生活不断受到破坏。这些由旧社会强加在土族人民头上的难以忘怀的痛苦生活，不用列举事实，大家也会想见一般的。解放后，在共产党和毛主席的平等、团结和宗教信仰自由政策的光辉照耀下，我们土族人民也跟全国其他少数民族人民一样，得到了平等的待遇；同时在共产党和人民政府的关怀、爱护和正确领导下，享受到了祖国大家庭中的温暖。在政治上，是史无前例的建立了民族自治政权——青海省互助土族自治县，保证了本民族人民得以当家作主管理本民族内部的事务。不少土族的子弟参加了工作，他们在党政机关领导下，正在全心全意的为人民服务。当去年农业合作化运动高潮席卷全国的时候，土族人民也投入了这一运动，他们跟其他兄弟民族的农民一道组 织并加入了农业生产合作社；而且大部分合作社是由几个民族（土、藏、回、汉等）的成员组成的。他们虽有各自不同的风俗习惯、宗教信仰和耕作方式，但最主要的一点是有着在共产党领导下走向幸福的社会主义社会的共同愿望和目标。在这个共同愿望和目标的基础上，他们正在以互相尊重风俗习惯、宗教信仰、互助合作和团结友爱的精神，为多打粮食、支援祖国工业建设和柴达木盆地的勘察和开发而进行着共同的劳动。这种新的民族关系的出现，只有在共产党和人民政府的领导下才有可能的。
    我是一个宗教人员，我们深切地感谢党和人民政府在各种社会改革和各项建设工作中，一贯地保护寺庙，尊重人民群众的宗教信仰，关怀和照顾宗教人员的特点等进行了一系列的工作。因此宗教人员的生活也随着生产的发展和人民群众生活的改善而得到了改善。例如：几年来到我们寺院念经、放布施的人一年年增多。这种情况是好的，说明了宗教信仰自由政策深入了人心。不过，还有些人自农业合作化运动高潮到来以后，由于对宗教信仰自由政策的永久性认识不够和一些干部对少数民族人民的宗教活动与风俗习惯尊重不够，加上坏分子的乘隙造谣破坏，使他们又产生了一些新的怀疑和顾虑。如说合作化后“财产不由自己了”“信教不由自己了”等。还有一些人由于不肯学习，懂得新的东西太少，所以也落后了。因此，我认为今后有必要进一步做好广泛深入的宣传教育工作；特别是通过一些具体事例，教育少数民族中的宗教人员，继续提高他们的思想认识，热爱祖国，大力支持祖国的社会主义建设事业，积极的赞助和推动本民族人民不断地进步和发展。同时还应教育他们继续分清敌友界线，时刻警惕暗藏敌人的阴谋圈套。这样，我们才不致让自己被敌人利用而沦为人民群众在前进道路上的挡路石。对落后的人进行教育，不但汉族干部有责任帮助，更主要的是本民族干部由于语言方便，风俗习惯熟悉，更有责任积极耐心的帮助。对少数民族地区工作的干部，也要进行教育，使他们更熟悉和正确的执行宗教信仰自由政策和各项民族政策，注意尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，以便巩固的共同团结起来，来建设我们美丽的新青海。各族人民在中国共产党、毛主席的领导下，在社会主义光明大道上继续前进。
