What to Pay Attention to in the Summer Harvest Distribution Propaganda
Wang Chengfang

Guiding agricultural production cooperatives in doing a good job in the summer harvest distribution is a central issue that all newspapers aimed primarily at farmers should currently pay attention to.

Although the summer harvest distribution is a preliminary distribution, it is of great importance. Whether this work is done well is related to the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives and the development of agricultural production. At the same time, many new cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, and large cooperatives are facing the distribution problem for the first time this year, making the task of doing a good job in the summer harvest distribution arduous and complex. However, not all rural cadres have realized this. For example, some people think that since the summer harvest pre-distribution was done last year, it will be easy this year; some people think that since it is a pre-distribution, it is not necessary to be so careful, as it will be fully accounted for after the autumn harvest; and still others worry that the summer harvest distribution will hinder current production and want to get it over with quickly. Therefore, in the propaganda of the summer harvest distribution, newspapers should fully explain the significance of doing this work well and powerfully criticize various erroneous understandings. Some newspapers have not only done this in their commentaries, but have also paid attention to using vivid factual reports to help people improve their understanding of the summer harvest distribution work. The Hubei Daily did just that. Some of the news reports published in this newspaper reflected the farmers' earnest concern and expectation for the summer harvest distribution, as well as their common ideological concerns and those caused by different economic conditions and the amount of labor available. The newspaper also cited the fact that the labor attendance rate of some cooperatives increased significantly after entering the summer harvest distribution. These facts illustrated the importance of the summer harvest distribution and refuted the claim that distribution would hinder production; at the same time, they reminded people that the summer harvest distribution work is a thorough and meticulous ideological education work, and that taking the summer harvest distribution work lightly would ruin things.

Implementing the "less deduction, more distribution" method in the summer harvest distribution means correctly handling the relationship between the agricultural cooperative collective and the individual members. It should be pointed out that in the past, many newspapers did not pay enough attention to the individual interests of cooperative members in promoting the relationship between the collective and the individual. In this summer harvest distribution propaganda, some newspapers have begun to correct this shortcoming. The Shaanxi Daily, Hubei Daily, and Henan Daily have all paid great attention to the income of cooperative members in the summer harvest distribution. The Shaanxi Daily criticized the idea of some rural cadres who only wanted to retain more public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and production costs without considering whether the majority of cooperative members could increase their income. The newspaper also published reports such as "The CCP Nanzheng County Committee Takes Measures to Correct the Bias of Not Considering the Income of Cooperative Members in the Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution" and "Liquan Tongxin Agricultural Cooperative Revises the Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution Plan," explaining how to correctly handle the interests of the cooperative and the individual interests of the cooperative members. In a newsletter titled "The Work Team's 'Pre-Distribution Plan'," the Henan Daily criticized the erroneous pre-distribution plan formulated by the CCP Pingyu County Committee work team, which took over and did everything itself. According to this pre-distribution plan, the deduction accounted for more than 53% of the total income. In the article "How We Implemented the Policy of 'Less Deduction and More Distribution' in the Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution," the Hubei Daily introduced how the Jingjiang Cooperative in Gong'an County corrected the "more retention and less distribution" thinking of the cooperative's leading cadres, thereby achieving "less deduction and more distribution." It can be seen from these reports and articles that the key to implementing the "less deduction and more distribution" method lies in educating cadres to overcome the idea of "more retention and less distribution"; at the same time, it is necessary to fully promote democracy in formulating the pre-distribution plan. Of course, whether it is possible to achieve "less deduction and more distribution" is closely related to whether the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily is implemented. The Shaanxi Daily pointed this out in its commentary on the summer harvest distribution, and in its later news about the Liquan Tongxin Cooperative revising the summer harvest pre-distribution plan, it used facts to point out that the reason why this cooperative was able to reduce the proportion of deductions from 45% to 30% was precisely because they were careful in their calculations and reduced unnecessary expenses. However, when newspapers combine the summer harvest distribution with the promotion of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, they must pay attention to being comprehensive and not giving people the wrong impression that some necessary expenses can also be saved and that parts that must be retained can also not be retained. It is necessary to point this out because it has been found that some cooperative members have a resistant attitude towards the cooperative's appropriate retention of public accumulation; some cadres also have the idea of completely ignoring public accumulation.

"Payment according to work, more work more pay" is the only correct principle for implementing socialist distribution. Advanced cooperatives must implement this principle. When newspapers publicize this principle, in addition to elaborating on it from a positive perspective, they must also oppose the egalitarianism of some cooperative cadres and members. For example, a cooperative in Hanyang County, Hubei, distributed the harvested beans according to the number of people. In response to this situation, the Hubei Daily published a commentary criticizing the egalitarianism that violated the principle of distribution according to work (and also pointed out that under the principle of adhering to distribution according to work, it is necessary to appropriately take care of some cooperative members with special difficulties). In addition, newspapers also reported the following facts in some news about the summer harvest distribution: Some cooperative members were originally worried about average distribution and did not actively participate in the cooperative's production; after the distribution, they saw that those who worked more earned more, their ideas changed, and they became more active in participating in production.

Many rural cadres are facing the problem of summer harvest distribution for the first time, and they lack experience. Therefore, it is also required that newspapers be able to introduce the specific practices of summer harvest distribution in a planned way. In this regard, the Henan Daily has done a better job. This newspaper has continuously introduced the practices of a county, a cooperative, or several cooperatives in formulating the summer harvest pre-distribution plan, especially focusing on reporting some important issues with universal significance. For example, the newspaper once introduced the practice of the Tangyin County Hanzhuang Township Lighthouse Cooperative in dealing with labor work points. Due to unsound labor organization, unclear demarcation of production or non-production work, and inconsistent original labor calculation standards, this cooperative had chaotic and unreasonable labor work accounts. The problems that the Lighthouse Cooperative had in terms of labor work points were precisely the problems that are common in many advanced and large cooperatives. Solving these problems is essential to creating important conditions for implementing the principle of distribution according to work. Newspapers paying attention to introducing experience in this area is obviously of great help to rural cadres. Of course, when introducing specific experience, newspapers also need to pay attention to the different issues in different regions and different cooperatives (such as economic crop areas, grain production areas, advanced cooperatives, primary cooperatives, new cooperatives, old cooperatives, cooperatives with good or poor management foundations, etc.). Judging from the articles published by the Henan Daily, such as "How Cooperatives that Harvest What They Plant Can Do a Good Job in the Wheat Season Distribution," they pay more attention to this.

In many areas, the summer harvest distribution has become the central task at hand, and local newspapers should strive to do a good job in this propaganda.

    在夏收分配的宣传中注意些什么
    王承放
    指导农业生产合作社做好夏收分配工作，是所有以农民为主要对象的报纸目前应当注意的一个中心问题。
    夏收分配虽是预分性质，但关系重大。这个工作做得好坏，关系到农业生产合作社的巩固和农业生产的发展。同时，今年有许多新社、高级社、大社是第一次面临分配问题，做好夏收分配又是一个艰巨复杂的任务。但是并不是所有的农村干部都已经认识到了这一点。例如有些人认为去年已经做过夏收预分，今年容易做；有人认为既是预分，就不必那么仔细，反正秋后还要总算账的；另外也还有一些人耽心夏收分配会妨碍当前生产，想草草了事。因此报纸在夏收分配的宣传中，就应当充分地阐明做好这个工作的意义，并对各种错误的认识进行有力的批判。若干报纸不仅在评论中进行了这样的工作，并且注意通过生动的事实报道来帮助人们提高对夏收分配工作的认识。湖北日报就是这样做的。在这个报纸发表的一些消息中，反映了农民对夏收分配的殷切关怀和期待，也反映了他们共同的和由于经济情况和劳力多寡强弱的不同而引起的不同的思想顾虑。报纸还举出了一些社在进入夏收分配以后劳动出勤率有显著提高的事实。这些事实，说明了夏收分配的重要性，驳倒了那种认为分配会妨碍生产的说法；同时，也提醒了人们：夏收分配工作是一个深入细致的思想教育工作，把夏收分配工作看得轻而易举，是会把事情搞糟的。
    在夏收分配中实行“少扣多分”的办法，意味着正确地处理农业合作社集体和社员个人之间的关系。应当指出，过去不少报纸在宣传集体和个人的关系方面，对于社员的个人利益是注意得不够的。在这次夏收分配的宣传中，一些报纸已在开始纠正这个缺点。陕西日报、湖北日报、河南日报等都以很大的注意力来关心社员在夏收分配中的收益。陕西日报在评论中批判了某些农村干部只想多留公积金、公益金和生产费用，而不考虑多数社员是否能增加收入的想法。这个报纸还发表了“中共南郑县委采取措施纠正夏收预分中不照顾社员收入的偏向”和“醴泉同心农业合作社重新修订夏收预分方案”等报道，说明应当怎样正确地处理社的利益和社员的个人利益。河南日报在一篇题为“工作组的‘预分方案’”的通讯里，批评了中共平舆县委工作组包办代替制定的错误的预分方案，按照这个预分方案，扣除数占到总收入的53％以上。湖北日报在“我们是怎样贯彻执行少扣多分的夏收预分政策的”文章中，介绍了公安县荆江合作社怎样纠正了社的领导干部的“多留少分”思想，从而做到了“少扣多分”。从这些报道和文章中可以看出：实行“少扣多分”的办法，关键在于教育干部克服“多留少分”的思想；同时在制定预分方案中必须充分地发扬民主。当然，能否做到“少扣多分”，和能否贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针有密切的关系。陕西日报在关于夏收分配的评论中指出了这一点，在以后发表的醴泉同心合作社重新修订夏收预分方案的消息中，又用事实指出：这个社所以能够把扣除的比例从45％降到30％，正是由于他们做到了精打细算，紧缩了不必要的开支。但是报纸在结合夏收分配宣传勤俭办社方针的时候，必须注意全面，不能给人一种错觉，似乎一些必要的开支也可以节约掉，必须要留的部分也可以不留。指出这一点是必要的，因为已经发现有些合作社的社员对社里适当地留下公共积累有抵触情绪；有些干部也有完全忽视公共积累的思想。
      “按劳计酬，多劳多得”是实行社会主义分配的唯一正确的原则。高级社必须贯彻执行这个原则。报纸在宣传这个原则的时候，除了必须从正面来进行阐述以外，同时要反对某些合作社干部和社员中的平均主义思想。如湖北汉阳县一个社就把收割的豆子按人口分了。针对这种情况，湖北日报发表了评论，批判了违背按劳分配原则的平均主义思想（同时也指出了在坚持按劳分配的原则下，适当地照顾一些有特殊困难的社员是必要的）。另外，报纸还在一些有关夏收分配的消息中，报道了这样的事实：有些社员原来耽心会平均分配，没有积极参加社的生产；分配以后，看到劳动多的收入也多，他们的想法变了，参加生产也积极了。
    许多农村干部还是第一次面临着夏收分配的问题，他们缺乏经验。因此，也就要求报纸能够有计划地介绍夏收分配的具体做法。在这一方面，河南日报做得比较好。这个报纸曾连续介绍了一个县、一个社或几个社制定夏收预分方案的做法，特别是抓住了一些带有普遍意义的重要问题进行报道。例如报纸曾经介绍了汤阴县韩庄乡灯塔合作社处理劳动工分的做法。这个社由于劳动组织不健全，对生产或非生产性用工等的界限没有划分清楚，以及原来的劳动计算标准不一致等原因，造成了劳动工账混乱和不合理的现象。而灯塔社在劳动工分方面存在的这些问题，恰恰也是许多高级社、大社所普遍存在着的问题。解决了这些问题，才能为贯彻执行按劳分配的原则创造重要的条件。报纸注意介绍这方面的经验，对于农村干部显然是有很大帮助的。当然，报纸在介绍具体经验中，也还需要注意到不同地区、不同社
  （如经济作物区、粮产区、高级社、初级社、新社、老社、经营管理基础好或差的社等等）的不同问题。关于这一点，从河南日报发表的“谁种谁收的社怎样做好麦季分配”等文章来看，他们是比较注意的。
    夏收分配在很多地区已成了当前的中心任务，各地报纸应该努力做好这一宣传。
