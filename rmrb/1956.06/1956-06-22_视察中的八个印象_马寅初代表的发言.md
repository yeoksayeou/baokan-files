    Eight Impressions from Inspection
    — Speech by Representative Ma Yinchu
    1.  A Mighty Agricultural Production Increase Movement; 2. Workers and Peasants Widely Launch Socialist Emulation; 3. Mass Farmland Water Conservancy Projects; 4. The Labor Concept of the Broad Masses is Strengthened; 5. Collective Thought is Budding; 6. The Problem of Cattle and Double-Wheel Double-Share Plows; 7. Farmers Learn to Use Scientific Knowledge; 8. Farmers Praise the New Life.
    I have inspected Zhejiang three times, the first and second times the inspection method was to first listen to the leadership report on the situation, and then hold forums and conduct on-the-spot inspections according to the situation, and select three types: relatively good, relatively bad, and medium, at the same time. Because many representatives joined together to conduct inspections, each person only asked a few questions, and each person asked questions based on personal interest, it was difficult to obtain a system. In the most recent inspection, the inspection method was changed. According to the decision of the Standing Committee, individuals could also conduct inspections independently. When holding forums, the method of dialogue was adopted, one question and one answer, all recorded by the accompanying friend (currently serving as the meeting record secretary) using shorthand. A total of 10 counties and cities, about 20 agricultural production cooperatives, and 1 fishery cooperative were inspected. Due to the large number of words in the complete record, it has not yet been analyzed and organized. Here, I can only talk about the impressions gained from the inspection for everyone's reference:
    (1) My first impression is: with the great victory of socialist transformation, a mighty agricultural production increase movement is proceeding smoothly throughout the province. This fact powerfully educates the peasant masses and strengthens their confidence and determination to participate in cooperatives and take the socialist road. Especially after the basic realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization in the province, the peasant masses grasped the key to increasing production in their local areas, adopted many unconventional methods, and gave full play to their high labor enthusiasm, achieving unprecedented results. Since last winter, in some areas, many people braved the rain in straw raincoats, lit gas lamps at night, and braved the cold to rush to repair water conservancy projects, building, expanding, and restoring large, medium, and small water conservancy projects, greatly reducing the threat of drought and flood. They explored fertilizer sources from all aspects. Whether men or women, they were all carrying pond mud, planting green manure, and accumulating other various soil fertilizers. In many areas, the accumulated fertilizer exceeded that of last year by more than double. This year, because there was a shortage of fertilizer for late rice, the people of the province used their brains to search for natural fertilizers everywhere, and more than 20 counties and more than 30 places have discovered a kind of peat. This is because a long time ago, after the remains of aquatic plants in lakes and swamp areas accumulated year by year, they became like coal after a long period of decay and decomposition due to poor soil ventilation conditions. The nitrogen content is generally above 1.5%, and the highest is 4.77%.
    Zhejiang has also done a lot of work in changing farming systems and improving technology, such as expanding double-cropping rice. Some areas only had dozens of mu of trial planting last year, but this year it has been expanded to several thousand mu, or even tens of thousands of mu, and dense planting has been widely adopted. When the double-cropping rice, or successive rice, is harvested for the first crop and planted for the second crop, it often requires a lot of manpower. As a result, women who have never worked in the fields have also generally gone to the fields to work, and some have already learned the technology of transplanting rice seedlings, and a few women have even mastered the technology better than men. However, many women have also contracted schistosomiasis because of this, and their big bellies are not necessarily a cause for joy.
    The famous Siming Mountain area of Zhejiang is the center of the anti-Japanese guerrilla area. In the past, no one had ever planted double-cropping corn, but some people had planted summer corn, and some people had planted autumn corn, and both had achieved bumper harvests. As a result, the technology promotion station carefully summarized this experience of increasing production, analyzed the natural conditions of the entire area, and affirmed that double-cropping would definitely increase production. As a result, all 1,630 mu of double-cropping corn promoted in the entire area achieved bumper harvests. Facts like this in the Siming Mountain area are not uncommon throughout the province.
    (2) My second impression is: socialist labor emulation is now being carried out in rural areas and towns. At present, workers and peasants are widely carrying out socialist emulation, not only between townships, but also between cooperatives, and even between teams and individuals. However, I feel that the intensity of work for both men and women in rural areas is too high, which will definitely be detrimental to their health. If we continue to vigorously promote emulation regardless of everything, will there be consequences that outweigh the gains in the long run?
    During my inspection, I focused not only on emulation, but also on production targets. Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Zhejiang Province not only have annual production increase targets, but also quarterly, monthly, and team production plans; in some areas, there is both collectivist spirit and individual responsibility; there are both targets and measures, which is why they are more and more interested in their work and have greater enthusiasm. However, some cooperatives do not consider the actual specific conditions and the potential that can be utilized, and the targets are often set too high, so that no one dares to believe that they can be completed on time. If they are forced to complete such tasks on the basis of excessive intensity, they may simply ignore them and not care. When I inquired about the production targets of one cooperative, the director answered me with the revised targets, speaking eloquently. However, after the meeting, I learned from other members of the cooperative that the director did not tell me the original targets, which were too high to be implemented. However, in some areas, the general targets are appropriate, with both specific content and compliance with reality, but sideline occupations are often not included, and there are too few types of sideline occupations. The main reason is that the leading comrades estimate the main occupations higher and the sideline occupations lower, giving the peasants the illusion that "sideline occupations are not worthwhile." This is due to the one-sided emphasis on grain production increase a few years ago due to insufficient grain production. As for household sideline occupations, they are simply out of the question.
    (3) My third impression is: For many years in Zhejiang Province, due to blind land reclamation and indiscriminate logging, the surface cover has been destroyed, so that in times of heavy rain, "water flows down the mountains and floods are big, and when the rain stops, the land suffers from drought." In order to meet the urgent needs of agricultural production, leaders at all levels have worked hard to develop mass farmland water conservancy projects and launched a large-scale movement to open canals, dig ponds, and build dams. Things that individual farmers could never do can be done by cooperating, which has played a great role in fighting drought and draining floods. Since then, the Party leadership has been determined to further implement the principle of people-run and government-assisted and the principle of saving money and achieving great results in water conservancy construction. Saplings have now been cultivated on the hillsides, and dikes have been repaired and willows planted along the river banks, but to eliminate the threat of drought and avoid flood disasters, it is still necessary to build large reservoirs and fundamentally control large rivers. At present, the broad masses cannot yet enjoy "no floods occur as the rain falls and seeps through, and there are many springs and long-flowing water after the rain" during the rainy season. However, the construction of large reservoirs and the fundamental control of large rivers (such as the Puyang River and the Cao'e River) require huge financial resources, complex technology, and a long time, and it is difficult to achieve significant results in the short term.
    (4) My fourth impression is: Whether in rural areas or in mountainous areas, the labor concept of the broad masses has been generated, and labor habits have been formed. This is the most gratifying thing. - "Socialism is really good, everyone has to do it together, you can't wait sitting down." "The mountains are full of treasures, and diligent people can dig them out." This is very different from the past dependence mentality of "keeping the green hills, and not worrying about firewood to burn." "Going to the cooperative for a day is a day's work, sitting at home for a day is an empty day." This is the general and universal understanding. Even landlords and counter-revolutionaries are increasingly disintegrating in the process of cooperatives transitioning from elementary to advanced, and they also express their willingness to abide by government laws, actively engage in labor reform, and perform meritorious service to redeem themselves. There are fewer and fewer stubborn counter-revolutionaries. The status of today's rich peasants: "No one wants to rent land, no one wants to be hired, there is no way to speculate and trade, and they are afraid of being sued for lending private money." There is no way out except to work hard.
    Labor has also produced happy marriages. When young men and women choose partners, they always take labor ability as the first condition, and then talk about progress. The concept of marriage has fundamentally changed. Labor has also produced happy families. Women have participated in production, gradually breaking away from their subordinate status and being respected. The atmosphere of discord between husband and wife, discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and discord between neighbors in the past is now gone forever. Exploitative ideas are considered shameful by both men and women, young and old. There is no theft in Xindeng County, Zhejiang, which shows that under the light of Marxism-Leninism, new marriages, new families, and new moral customs are growing day by day.
    (5) My fifth impression is: Collective thought is budding. For thousands of years, it has been difficult for farmers accustomed to small-scale peasant economy to quickly transform their individualistic thinking into socialist collective thinking. This transformation must be a long-term process, but it is clear that this transformation has already begun. Take the Xinmin Advanced Cooperative in Xinchang County, Zhejiang, as an example. There is such a situation in the cooperative: Last year, 12 households in the cooperative discounted their wheat to join the cooperative, and 11 other households also agreed to discount their wheat to join the cooperative at the beginning, but because they had sufficient funds and strong labor, they saw that the wheat was harvested and were unwilling to discount their wheat to join the cooperative, and did not believe that the cooperative could increase production more than them. The cooperative was unable to persuade them, so they had to agree that these 11 households would not discount their wheat to join the cooperative. As a result, they suffered a great loss, while the 12 households that discounted their wheat to join the cooperative increased by more than 50 yuan over last year, and the other 7 households increased by more than 5 yuan over last year. The total income of Chunhua of Xinmin Cooperative is 5,238 yuan, excluding the 11 households that did not discount their wheat to join the cooperative, the average increase per household is 27.6 yuan over last year. This is the pre-distribution figure, and the actual output will exceed it. These 11 households have been so greatly taught a lesson, and their individualistic thinking cannot but be affected.
    The same Xinmin Cooperative, as far as the entire cooperative is concerned, cannot be said to have no collective thought. According to the Xinchang County Chief, the county's silkworm seeds increased by 300 sheets over last year, but because there were not enough mulberry leaves, 800 sheets were dumped, and the actual decrease was 500 sheets compared to last year, but the output was not affected, because this year each sheet yielded 10 kilograms more cocoons than last year. If there were enough mulberry leaves, 800 sheets of silkworm seeds would not be dumped, and the county could have an additional income of 40,000 yuan. Xinchang sent people to Sheng County, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Shangyu and other seven counties to adjust mulberry leaves, but because the allocation was late, it was affected and production was reduced. The main reason is that in the past, all were raised native species, but this year all were changed to raising improved species. Improved species eat 90 to 100 kilograms more mulberry leaves per sheet than native species. The leaders underestimated this point, so 800 sheets were dumped, resulting in a loss of 40,000 yuan. However, although this Xinmin Cooperative did not have enough mulberry leaves for its own consumption, it allocated mulberry leaves to supply other cooperatives, because the silkworms of other cooperatives were about to go up the mountain, and if there were no leaves to eat, they would all have to be dumped. The Xinmin Cooperative held a spirit of self-sacrifice, causing part of its own silkworms to starve for three days, resulting in reduced production. This is a concrete manifestation of the collectivist spirit. According to senior leaders, this kind of high degree of collective spirit is still rare in the province, but undoubtedly it is growing day by day everywhere.
    (6) My sixth impression is: The cattle seen in various places are not very fat and strong, and some are thin and weak. The main reasons are: (1) There are problems with feeding; (2) The cattle sheds are not regularly cleaned and disinfected, and the cattle are infested with lice, which suck the cattle's blood, so it is of course difficult for the cattle to be fat and strong. The cattle herders do not regularly brush the cattle's bodies to remove lice, and rarely smoke the cattle at night in summer to repel mosquitoes. The few cattle sheds and pig pens I saw were not hygienic at all. Most of the cattle herders are children, one person looking after one head, with a salary of only about 10 yuan per month. They are not responsible, so the cattle run around everywhere, damaging crops. I think that it will take several years to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification on a national scale; in the short term, it is still necessary to use cattle power to plow the fields, and the problem of cattle cannot be ignored. Especially when the collective spirit has not yet been universally developed, it is even more important to pay attention to it. It seems that a system should be established, with special personnel responsible for feeding, timely inspection and evaluation, and timely ideological education for cooperative members on cherishing cattle.
    Of course, the above-mentioned situation is not universal. There are also many places in Zhejiang where the cattle are raised very well and very strong, such as the Xianfeng Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dayuan Township, Xuanping County, and the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuxiang Township, Haiyan County. They have good experience in breeding and raising cattle, which can be promoted to various parts of the province.
    As for new agricultural implements such as double-wheel double-share plows, most of them are left unused in Zhejiang Province. One reason is that the plow body is too heavy, and with iron wheels, it is easy to sink into the mud. Even buffaloes cannot pull or drag it. The second reason is that the two cattle have no habit of cooperation, and the speed is inconsistent. Wherever I went, old-fashioned wooden plows were used to plow the fields, so there is a song in Shaoxing: "Double-wheel double-share plow, children ride it like a horse, cadres look at it with a belly full of anger." The most popular thing among farmers is water pumps (mechanical waterwheels), first of all because farmers recognize that expanding irrigated land is one of the important keys to overcoming natural disasters and ensuring increased agricultural production, and in addition to irrigating the original paddy fields, they can also turn dry land into irrigated land. Secondly, because using water pumps is more efficient and cheaper than using manpower or animal-powered waterwheels.
    (7) My seventh impression is: Farmers also recognize the value of scientific knowledge and have begun to use it to seek their own interests. Liangzhu Township, Hang County, promoted the "high-temperature young silkworm, night-time photosensitivity, and multiple feeding of mulberry" rapid silkworm rearing method in silkworm production, and achieved significant increases in production. The benefit of photosensitivity is that the silkworm room is illuminated day and night, so that the small silkworms will not lie in the remaining mulberry leaves and silkworm droppings at night, reducing the loss of small silkworms, and they can eat mulberry in a balanced way day and night, so the development is also uniform. It is best to paper or whitewash the walls above and east, west, north, and south of the silkworm room to allow the reflection to shine on the upper and inner silkworm beds, but most of the villages have thatched sheds, which cannot be papered or whitewashed at all. This is an unavoidable limitation.
    I have been to the famous "Longjing Tea" producing area - Meijiawu Village, suburban Hangzhou City. The "October" Advanced Cooperative in the village used scientific knowledge in 1955 to overcome natural disasters and achieve a bumper harvest in tea production. The "October" Cooperative received several cold wave (late frost) warnings from the weather station. The entire cooperative, led by the Youth Commando, burned smoke piles in the tea gardens overnight and finally overcame the harm of late frost.
    There are 35 fishery production cooperatives in Shengsi County, Zhejiang, and the number of fishermen who have joined the cooperatives accounts for 95.3% of the total number of fishermen. By "Xiaoxue" (Minor Snow), more than 500 production units in the county went to sea, with an average output of 20 to 30 dan of fish per unit. Li Alin, a 62-year-old cooperative member who has been fishing for more than 40 years, has never been to such distant waters to fish. Now that the people are united (meaning organized) and weather information is released in a timely manner to ensure safe production, he is not afraid to go any further.
    There are many examples of using scientific knowledge to produce like this throughout the province, so I won't talk about them here.
    (8) My eighth impression is: In contrast to the old and new life, the farmers' gratitude to the Party, their satisfaction with the current happy life, and their confidence in a bright future are revealed everywhere. A letter from the Rongxing Advanced Cooperative in Chengbei District, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang, to Chairman Mao is a good example. It says: "In the era of reactionary rule, we had seven 'mores': (1) More dilapidated houses (there were 52 households in the whole village, of which 23 were dilapidated houses), (2) More tattered clothes (accounting for all), (3) More yellow and thin people (36 people), (4) More hired laborers (26 people), (5) More beggars (24 people), (6) More people who died unjustly (23 people), (7) More girls sold (8 people). Since we obtained land six years ago, thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the suffering of these seven 'mores' has been basically eliminated." Before liberation, Xindeng County circulated two songs like this:
          Changshan Ban, look at a big Ban,
          One basket of harvest in autumn,
          The rice bucket is set up,
          No rice to cook for the New Year.
                × × ×
          Changshan Ban, Dongtang Ban,
          Pick out a big load,
          Come back with a small basket;
          Busy day and night,
          When the flood comes, cry.
    Today, the situation is very different. I always hear that this field produces a thousand jin, and that family is a ten thousand jin household. They are the people who used to "set up the rice bucket and have no rice to cook for the New Year." Now, when they encounter floods, they no longer cry, but bravely overcome the floods and have the confidence that human power can conquer nature.
    In Guishan Pian, Tingshan Township, Shaoxing County, the following folk song is now circulating:
    Clothes are worn brand new,
    Roads are paved flat every day,
    Products reach 1,200 jin (the yield of successive rice is as high as 1,200 jin per mu), and the belly is full,
    Those who participate in cooperatives all eat a lot,
    Those who work alone and mutual aid groups starve to death.
                      × × ×
    The people's government manages it right,
    Roads are being built everywhere,
    Bridges are built high and big,
    Not a single worker is "grabbed."
      During the Japanese occupation, a fort was built,
    Went to the city and workers were "grabbed,"
    I said I wouldn't do it,
    I was slapped hard,
    Nowhere to talk,
    In the afternoon, chickens were "grabbed,"
    Women were raped,
    Young women dressed up as old women.
    In other places, farmers reflected that in terms of eating, "In the past, it was half a year of bran and vegetables, but now it is selling surplus grain every year." In terms of clothing, "In the past, there was food but no hats, and little bedding, but now we wear city cloth clothes and cover ourselves with fancy flannel at night." The clothes worn in the past were "New for three years, old for three years, patched and mended for another three years." Now it is: "A new one, an old one, wash one, change one."

    视察中的八个印象
    ——马寅初代表的发言
    1、声势浩大的农业增产运动；2、工人农民广泛开展社会主义竞赛；3、群众性的农田水利工程；4、广大群众劳动观念加强；5、集体思想正在萌芽；6、耕牛和双轮双铧犁问题；7、农民学会运用科学知识；8、农民歌颂新生活。
    我视察浙江先后三次，第一第二两次的视察方式是先听取领导报告情况，然后根据情况分别开座谈会实地视察，并选择比较好的，比较坏的，中等的三种类型同时进行。因为许多代表联合起来进行视察，每人所问不过几次，且各人皆凭个人兴趣发问，很难得出一个系统。最近一次视察，改变了视察方式，我依照常务委员会的决定，个人亦可以单独进行视察，座谈时采用对谈方式，一问一答，均由同去的友人
  （现任会议纪录秘书）用速记法录下，共视察了10个县、市，约20个农业生产合作社，1个渔业合作社。全部记录，因字数太多，尚未加以分析和整理，在这里我只能把视察所得的印象分别说一说，以供大家参考：
    （一）我第一个印象是：随着社会主义改造的伟大胜利，一个声势浩大的农业增产运动，正在全省范围内顺利进行，这个事实有力的教育了农民群众，坚定了他们参加合作社走社会主义道路的信心和决心，特别在全省基本实现高级农业合作化以后，农民群众抓住当地的增产关键，采取了许多打破常规的办法，发挥高度的劳动积极性，获得了前所未有的成绩。去冬以来，在若干地区，不少群众下雨披着蓑衣，晚间点着汽灯，忍寒冒雨地抢修水利，兴建扩建和恢复大、中型水利工程和小型水利，大大地减轻了旱涝威胁。他们从各方面挖掘肥源，无论男女都在挑塘泥，播绿肥，并积其他各种土肥，很多地区积累的肥料超过去年一倍以上。今年因晚稻缺少肥料很多，全省人民群众用了脑筋四处找寻天然肥料，已有20多个县30多处发现了一种坭炭。这就是很早以前，当湖泊沼泽地区水生植物的遗体逐年累积起来以后，因土壤通气条件不好经过长时期的腐烂分解，就变成像煤炭一样的东西，其中氮素含量一般在1.5％以上，最高达4.77％。
    浙江在改变耕作制度，改进技术方面，也做了不少的工作，如扩大双季稻，有的地区去年不过有几十亩田的试种，而今年已扩大到几千亩，甚至几万亩，并普遍地采用了密植。双季稻中的连作稻在头作割起二作种下的时候，往往需要很多人力，于是历来不下田的妇女，也普遍下田耕作了，而且有的已经学会了栽秧的技术，且少数妇女所掌握的技术反在男子之上，不过好多妇女也因此得了血吸虫病，她们的大肚子不一定是可喜的。
    浙江著名的四明山区是抗日游击区的中心，在过去从来没有人种过双季玉米，但是有人种过夏玉米，也有人种过秋玉米，并且都获得丰收，于是技术推广站认真地总结这个增产的经验，分析了全区的自然条件后，肯定种双季一定能够增产，结果全区推广的1，630亩双季玉米全部获得丰收，像四明山区这种事实全省各地是不少的。
      （二）第二个印象是：现在在农村中城镇中，开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。目前工人农民正在广泛地开展社会主义竞赛，不但有乡与乡的竞赛，社与社的竞赛，还有队与队、人与人的竞赛，不过我觉得农村中无论男女，工作的强度太高，于身体健康定有妨碍，若再不顾一切积极推动竞赛，在长时期内，会不会出现得不偿失的后果？
    我在视察中把重点不但放在竞赛上，也放在生产指标上。浙江省各地农业生产合作社不但有全年增产指标，还有季度、月度及小队生产计划；有的地区，既有集体主义精神，又有个人的责任；既有指标，又有措施，这就是他们工作越干越有兴趣、劲头越大的道理。但也有些社不考虑实际的具体条件和可以利用的潜力，把指标规定得往往偏高，以致谁也不敢相信能够按时完成，在强度过高的基础上，若再迫他们完成这样的任务，他们或会置之不理，索性不管。有一社在我询问生产指标时，社长以修订过的指标答我，说得头头是道。但在散会后，从别的社员中得悉社长没有以原来偏高无法执行的指标告我。不过在若干地区，一般指标是妥当的，既有具体内容，又符合实际，可是副业往往不包括在内，而且副业种类亦太少，主要原因是领导同志把正业估得高一些，把副业估得低一些，使农民有一种
  “副业不合算”的错觉。这是由于数年前因粮食生产不足，曾片面强调粮食增产之所致。至于家庭副业则根本谈不上。
      （三）第三个印象是：浙江省多少年来，由于盲目开荒，滥伐树木，破坏了地面被复，以致大雨时期，“水顺山流洪水大，雨停天干地遭殃”，各级领导为了满足农业生产的迫切需要，曾努力发展群众性的农田水利工程，开展了大规模的开渠挖塘筑坝运动，个体农民从来办不到的事，合作起来就能办到了，对抗旱排洪起了很大的作用。此后兴修水利，党领导决心进一步贯彻民办公助的方针和费省效大的原则。现在山坡上已经育起幼林，沿江岸已经修堤植柳，但要消灭干旱威胁，避免洪水灾害，还有待于大水库的修建，大河流的根治。目前广大群众在雨季时还不能欣赏“随下随渗无洪水，雨后多泉水长流”。不过大水库的修建，大河流的根治
  （如浦阳江、曹娥江），需要庞大的财力、复杂的技术和较长的时间，在短时期内很难得到显著的成就。
      （四）第四个印象是：无论在农村或在山区，广大群众的劳动观念已经产生，劳动习惯已经养成，这是最可喜的一件事。——“社会主义真是好，就得大家搞，坐着等不到。”“山上全是宝，勤人挖得到。”比过去的“留得青山在，不怕无柴烧”的依赖思想大不相同了。“到社动一天是一天工，在家坐一天是一天空”。这是一般的普遍的认识。就是地主以及反革命分子在合作社由初级转到高级的过程中日益在分化，也表示愿意遵守政府法令，积极劳动改造，立功赎罪，顽固的反革命分子越来越少了。今日富农的地位：
  “出租土地无人要，想找雇工无人当，投机买卖无门路，放贷私款怕告状”，除了安心劳动以外别无出路了。
    劳动亦产生了幸福的婚姻。青年男女在选择对象时，总以劳动能力为第一条件，然后再谈进步，婚姻观念根本改变了。劳动也产生了幸福的家庭，妇女参加了生产，逐渐脱离了从属地位，受到尊重，昔日的夫妻不和、婆媳不和、邻里不和的气象，现在一去不复返了。剥削思想，无论男女老幼均认为可耻，浙江新登县全县已无一个窃盗，足见在马列主义光芒照耀之下，新的婚姻新的家庭，新的道德风尚，正在一天一天成长起来。
      （五）第五个印象是：集体思想正在萌芽。几千年来，习惯于小农经济的农民，很难迅速地把个人主义的思想转变为社会主义的集体思想，这样的转变必然是长时期的过程，但很显然地这个转变已经开始了。以浙江新昌县的新民高级合作社为例，社里有这样的情形：去年社里有12户的小麦折价入社，还有11户当初也同意折价入社，但因为资金较足，劳动力较强，一看小麦丰收，就不愿折价入社了，并且不信社里能比他们增产多，社里无法说服，只得同意这11户不折价入社，结果他们吃了大亏，而折价归社的12户，比去年增加50元以上的有5户，其他7户都比去年增加5元以上。新民社春花总收入合起来是5，238元，不折价入社的11户除外，每户平均比去年增产27.6元，这是预分数，实产还要超过。这11户，受了这样大的教训，他们的个人主义思想不能不受到影响。
    同是这个新民社，以整个社而论，不能说无集体思想。据新昌县长谈，全年全县蚕种比去年增加了300张，但因为桑叶不够，倒掉了800张，实际反比去年减少了500张，但产量不受影响，因为今年比去年每张多收10斤茧。如果桑叶足，800张蚕种不倒掉，全县可多收入4万元。新昌派人到嵊县、绍兴、余姚、上虞等七县去调剂桑叶，但因为调拨来迟，便受影响减产。主要原因是过去都养土种，今年全部改养改良种，改良种比土种每张多吃90斤到100斤桑叶，领导人员对这一点估计不足，所以倒掉了800张，损失了4万元。但是这个新民社虽然自己的桑叶还不够吃，反把桑叶调拨出去供给别的社，因为别的社的蚕快要上山，如果没有叶吃，便全部要倒掉，新民社抱自我牺牲的精神，使自己的一部分蚕饿了三天，造成减产，这是集体主义精神的具体表现。据高级领导者谈，这样的高度集体精神在全省范围内还不多见，但无疑地各地一天一天在增长着。
      （六）第六个印象是：各地所看到的耕牛不甚肥壮，有的是瘦弱的。主要原因是：（1）因饲养有问题；（2）牛栏不经常打扫消毒，牛身上生牛虱，吸牛血，耕牛当然难得肥壮，而看牛者也不经常刷牛体，除牛虱，夏天夜里很少熏烟驱蚊，我所看到的几个牛栏猪圈，根本谈不上卫生。看牛者大半是小孩，一人看一头，待遇每月不过10元左右，不负责任，所以耕牛到处乱跑，损害农作物。我以为要在全国范围内实现农业机械化和电气化，尚须等待若干年；在短时期内，尚须利用牛力耕田，耕牛问题不能不重视，尤其在集体思想还未普遍发达的时候，更不能不重视，似应订立一种制度，有专人负责饲养，及时检查评比，并及时对社员进行爱护耕牛的思想教育。
    以上所说的情况当然不是普遍的，浙江也有好多地方把耕牛养得很好很健壮的，如宣平县大源乡之先锋高级农业生产合作社，海盐县歟城乡之红星农业生产合作社，对于繁殖耕牛和饲养耕牛都有很好的经验，当可推广至省内各地。
    至于新式农具如双轮双铧犁，在浙省大都搁置不用，一因犁身太重，加以铁轮，容易陷入泥沼，虽水牛亦拖、拉不动；二因两只耕牛向无合作的习惯，先后快慢不一致。我足迹所到的地方，都用旧式木犁耕田，故绍兴有“双轮双铧犁，小孩当马骑，干部看了一肚皮气”之歌。最受农民欢迎的是抽水机（机械水车），首先是因为农民认识了扩大水浇地是战胜自然灾害、保证农业增产的重要关键之一，且除灌溉原有的水稻田外，还可变旱地为水浇地。其次因为使用抽水机比使用人力或畜力水车效率大，成本低。
      （七）第七个印象是：农民亦认识了科学知识之可贵，开始利用之以为自己谋利益。杭县良渚乡，在养蚕生产中推行了“稚蚕高温，夜间感光，多回给桑”的快速养蚕法，获得显著的增产。感光的好处，是使蚕室内日夜有光，小蚕到夜间便不会伏在吃剩下来的残余桑叶和蚕沙中，减少小蚕的遗失，并且日夜能够平衡食桑，发育也就整齐。最好蚕室上方及东西南北四方墙壁，用白纸裱糊或石灰粉刷，使反光能射到上层及内边蚕?，不过乡村中多茅棚，根本不能用白纸裱糊或石灰粉刷，这是无可避免的一种限制。
    我到过著名的“龙井茶”产地——杭州市郊区梅家坞村，村里的“十月”高级社于1955年利用了科学知识，战胜了自然灾害，使茶叶生产获得丰收。“十月”社数次接到气象台的寒流（降晚霜）警报，全社由青年突击队带头，连夜在茶园里烧烟堆，终于战胜了晚霜的危害。
    浙江嵊泗县有35个渔业生产合作社，入社的渔户占渔户总数的95.3％。到
  “小雪”边，全县500多个生产单位开洋，平均每个单位产鱼二、三十担，有一个捕鱼40多年、62岁的老社员李阿林，从来没有到过这样远的洋面去捕过鱼，现在人心齐
  （意思有组织）且及时发布气象消息，保证安全生产，再远他也不怕。
    像这样利用科学知识来生产的例子，全省范围内是不少的，兹不谈。
      （八）第八个印象是：农民在新旧生活对比之下，对于党的感激，对于现在幸福生活的满意，对于美满前途的信心，是到处流露出来的。浙江萧山县城北区荣星高级社交我带给毛主席的一封信，是一个好例子，它说：“在反动统治时代，我们有七个‘多’，（一）破舍多（全村共有52户，其中23户是破舍），（二）破衣多
  （占全部），（三）黄胖多（36人），
  （四）长工多（26人），（五）讨饭多
  （24人），（六）屈死多（23人），（七）卖女多（8人）。自分得土地后六年来，感谢毛主席的英明领导，这七个‘多’的痛苦已经基本上消灭了”。新登县在解放前流传着这样的两首歌，
          长衫畈，看看一大畈，
          秋收一箩担，
          稻桶一竖起，
          无米烧年饭。
                ×　×　×
          长衫畈，东塘畈，
          挑出一大担，
          回来一提篮；
          日亦忙，
          夜亦忙，
          大水来了哭一场。
    今日情形大不同了，总听到这田是千斤田，那家是万斤户，他们就是过去“稻桶一竖起，无米烧年饭”的人家，现在碰到洪水，他们再不是哭一场，而是奋勇地战胜了洪水，有人力可以胜天之信心。
    绍兴县亭山乡贵山片现在流传着这样的歌谣：
    衣裳穿得簇簇新，
    马路铺得天天平，
    产品起到一千二百斤（连作稻每亩产量高达一千二百斤），肚皮吃得结等等，
    参加合作社都吃的有得多，
    单干户互助组饿煞自之过。
                      ×　×　×
    人民政府理勿错，
    各到各处马路做，
    造起桥高又高大又大，
    小工一个都不“抓”（读“可”）。
      日佬时候炮台造一个，
    走到城里小工“抓”（读“可”），
    我话勿去做，
    巴掌吃得老老大，
    话话无处话，
    下昼出来鸡要“抓”（读“可”），
    看见妇女要强霸，
    青年妇女打扮老太婆。
    在别的地方，农民反映说，在吃的方面，“过去是糠菜半年粮，现在是年年卖余粮”。在穿的方面，“过去是有吃无戴，少铺无盖，现在是身上穿的市布衣，黑夜盖的花贡呢。”过去所穿的衣服是“新三年，旧三年，缝缝补补又三年。”现在是：“新一件，旧一件，洗一件，换一件”。
