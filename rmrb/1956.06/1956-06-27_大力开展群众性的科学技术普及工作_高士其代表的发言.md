Vigorously Develop Mass Scientific and Technological Popularization Work
——Speech by Representative Gao Shiqi
　　I am a person who is almost paralyzed, and I feel extremely excited to be able to speak at the conference today.
　　I listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I feel very satisfied. I fully agree with these reports.
　　These reports vividly reflect the splendid picture of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, specifically illustrate the implementation and progress of our country's first five-year plan for developing the national economy, and point out the direction and path for continued efforts in the future. I am particularly interested in the development of industry.
　　During my inspection of many state-owned and joint state-private factories in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and other places, a vigorous new atmosphere was present everywhere from workshop to workshop.
　　While inspecting these factories, I paid special attention to the workers' technical learning. Some larger factories have established spare-time schools and remedial classes, which have played a certain role in improving the cultural, scientific, and technical level of employees, but they still cannot meet the employees' requirements for learning culture and science, while more small and medium-sized factories have paid little attention to employees' requirements in this regard. The technical level of many factory workers is still very low. For example, in the local state-owned Hangzhou Silk Factory, most of the workers and technicians in the workshop only have elementary school education and lack theoretical knowledge of science and technology. They rely solely on experience, and when the machines break down, they rely on experience to repair and match parts. Sometimes they can repair them, and sometimes they cannot be solved for a long time, which affects production and the plan cannot be completed on schedule. Another example is the Zhejiang Shaoxing Distillery. The factory's main product is Shaoxing wine, which is a famous specialty of our country and enjoys a high reputation both at home and abroad. However, the equipment in this factory is very simple, the sanitary conditions are poor, and it is still an old set of production methods. Shaoxing wine can only be produced for two months of the year. Although a set of operating procedures has been summarized based on experience, reducing some defective products, it still cannot solve the problem of year-round production. This shows that the backwardness of the scientific and technical level of employees is one of the reasons affecting production.
　　Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to march towards science and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions decided to launch a wave of advanced producers, the labor masses' enthusiasm for production and their desire to learn technology have become even higher. Today, we humans are on the eve of the second technological revolution. The peaceful use of atomic energy has achieved brilliant achievements, and the successive inventions of semiconductors and electronic computers have made machines serve mankind further, and the general production process may be automated. Under this new situation, as the masters of the new era, we must have science and technology. The laboring masses must master science and technology and strive to learn advanced experience in order to better serve socialist construction. However, the content that the laboring masses require to learn is very extensive, and the learning conditions are extremely complex. Relying solely on the strength of spare-time technical schools and remedial classes is not enough. We must vigorously carry out mass scientific and technological popularization work in order to meet the needs of the masses more fully in combination with actual needs and various specific conditions.
　　In this situation, encouraged by the call of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the enthusiasm of the national scientific and technological circles has been greatly increased. At present, they have fully realized that handing over their scientific knowledge to the people, so that all workers and peasants become cultured, educated, and knowledgeable people, is their bounden and glorious duty.
　　This year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions requested the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization to universally hold regular science and technology lectures in the entire trade union system and in various grassroots trade unions. The Central Committee of Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and other units have also put forward their requirements to the association, and the demand for science and technology from the 500 million agricultural population is even greater. In order to improve the scientific and technical level of the working people and serve the country's socialist construction, I suggest:
　　1. People's committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over the work of the Science and Technology Popularization Association and provide full support and assistance to the branches of the Science and Technology Popularization Association in terms of staffing, funding, and the allocation of full-time cadres.
　　2. It is hoped that the financial departments will list the funding of the Science and Technology Popularization Association as one of the national budget items.
　　3. People's committees at all levels should appropriately include the science popularization work in the local science work plan or cultural and educational undertaking plan.

### 大力开展群众性的科学技术普及工作——高士其代表的发言

    大力开展群众性的科学技术普及工作
    ——高士其代表的发言
    我是一个身体将近瘫痪的人，今天能在大会上发言，感到无比的兴奋。
    我听了李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明以及彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，感到非常满意。我完全同意这些报告。
    这些报告，生动地反映出我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的灿烂图景，具体地说明了我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的执行情况和进度，并且指出了今后继续努力的方向和途径。尤其使我感到兴趣的是工业方面发展的情况。
    这次我在上海、浙江等地视察了许多国营和公私合营的工厂，从车间到车间，到处都呈现着蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    在视察这些工厂的时候，我特别注意到工人学习技术的情况。有些较大的工厂举办了业余学校和补习班，这些业余学校和补习班，对提高职工的文化科学技术水平起了一定的作用，但还是不能满足职工对学习文化科学的要求，而更多的中小型工厂对职工这方面的要求，还注意得很少。许多工厂的工人同志的技术水平目前仍然很低。例如，地方国营杭州绸厂，那里车间所有的工人和技术员，大部分只有小学文化程度，很缺乏科学技术的理论知识，光凭经验办事，遇到机器出了毛病，只凭经验来东修西配，有的时候修好了，有的时候长时期得不到解决，使生产受到影响，计划不能按期完成。又如浙江绍兴酒厂，该厂产品主要是绍酒，绍酒是我国著名的特产，不论在国内或国外，都有很高的声誉，但这个工厂里的设备非常简陋，卫生条件很差，至今仍然是一套老的制作方法，一年之内只有二个月的时间可以制作绍酒，虽然目前根据经验总结了一套操作规程，减少了一些次品，但还不能解决长年生产问题。这说明了职工科学技术水平的落后是影响生产的原因之一。
    自从党中央提出向科学进军的号召和全国总工会决定展开先进生产者运动的热潮以来，劳动群众的生产热情和学习技术的愿望，是更加高涨了。而在今天，我们人类正处在第二次技术大革命的前夕，原子能的和平利用，已经获得了辉煌的成就，半导体和电子计算机的相继发明，使机器更进一步地为人类服务，一般生产过程都有可能自动化。在这种新形势之下，作为新时代的主人，更不能没有科学技术了。劳动群众必须掌握科学技术，努力学习先进经验，才能更好的为社会主义建设服务。然而，劳动群众要求学习的内容是非常广泛的，学习的条件又极为复杂，单靠业余技术学校和补习班的力量是不够的，必须大力开展群众性的科学技术普及工作，才能结合实际需要和各种的具体条件，较充分地满足群众的需要。
    在这种情况下，在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”号召的鼓舞下，全国科学技术界的积极性大大地提高了，目前他们已充分认识到，把自己的科学知识交给人民，使所有的工人和农民都成为有文化、有教养、有科学知识的人，是自己义不容辞的光荣职责。
    今年全国总工会就要求中华全国科学技术普及协会要在整个工会系统中，在各基层工会普遍举办经常性的科学技术讲演，青年团中央委员会，全国民主妇女联合会，人民解放军总政治部等单位也都向协会提出了他们的要求，五亿农业人口对科学技术的要求就更为巨大了。为了提高劳动人民的科学技术水平，为国家的社会主义建设事业服务，我建议：
    一、各级人民委员会要加强对科学技术普及协会工作的领导，在编制、经费以及专职干部的配备上，给予科学技术普及协会分支会以充分的支持和帮助。
    二、希望财政部门把科学技术普及协会的经费列为国家预算项目之一。
    三、各级人民委员会应在当地的科学工作规划中，或文教事业规划中，适当列入科学普及工作的部分。
