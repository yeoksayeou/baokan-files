I completely agree with and support the reports and explanations made by Vice Premier Li, Minister Liao, and Vice Chairman Peng. In addition to suggesting that the conference approve and adopt them, we must resolutely implement them in our future work. Now I would like to talk about my views on the issue of increasing crop yields in our province, and please point out any corrections.

Since Chairman Mao made the report on agricultural cooperation in July 1955, and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted and promulgated the resolution on agricultural cooperation in October, agricultural cooperation in Shaanxi Province has undergone several upsurges and has also made tremendous progress. As of the end of April this year, statistics show that 91.12% of farmers have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, of which advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives have reached 62.93% of the total number of farmers. This great victory of agricultural cooperation is of great significance to the development of agriculture in the province, especially to increasing the yield of grain crops.

Due to the great victory of agricultural cooperation, the broad masses of peasants have undergone profound changes in their thinking. For example, in the "July 1st" agricultural cooperative in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County, led by Delegate Pu Zhongzhi, there was a 53-year-old member named Liu Sanhai. After joining the advanced cooperative, he excitedly shaved off his 11-year-old beard and even wrote a clapper rhyme saying: "The Kuomintang, conscription, and forced labor, not alive when old, keeping a beard to avoid service and beg for food; after liberation, land distribution and mutual aid, everyone is lively, harvesting grain has food to eat, age turns young, therefore I simply shaved off my beard." More than 600 members of the Douma Agricultural Cooperative in Douma Village, Xingping County, led by Delegate Xu Jingzhang, after several days and nights of intense labor during the period of collecting fertilizer, not only demolished the old city wall, which was about 2 li long and about 3 meters wide, with about 24,000 carts of soil, and transported it to the fields as fertilizer, but also built a new city wall within a few days. Their enthusiasm for labor was extraordinarily moving. Xu Yunxing, an old man in the cooperative, over 70 years old and blind in both eyes, was so excited that he couldn't sleep at night, and asked his grandson to take him with a lantern to listen to the tense labor of the cooperative members releasing the city and pulling dung. He said excitedly to the township head: "I have lived my whole life and never experienced such great events." Other cases, such as landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements in the countryside, were also moved to undergo great transformations.

Such profound changes in the thinking of the peasant masses are also greatly beneficial to agricultural production. For example, the Hongguang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an has a Jingyu Gully nearby. To divert water for irrigation, it is necessary not only to cross the Loess Plateau, but also to cross the deep valley, which was historically impossible. Since the transformation to a cooperative, the members have tried every means to overcome the difficulties, drilled holes in the plateau, and built aqueducts in the deep valley, and they actually built a complete canal to divert water for irrigation, turning more than 7,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. The increased output this year can not only offset the canal construction investment, but also have a surplus. Similar examples are too numerous to mention.

In the past few years, the growth rate of agricultural production in Shaanxi Province has been very rapid. Taking 1949 as the base, by 1955 (which suffered from spring drought and autumn floods), the province's grain output had increased by 37%; cotton output had increased by more than doubled; the number of large livestock had increased by 78%; and the afforestation area had expanded by 15 times.

On this basis, coupled with all the favorable conditions brought about by cooperation and all effective measures in agricultural technology, I believe that Shaanxi's agricultural production will achieve greater development in the future. In particular, the yields of major crops such as wheat, cotton, and oilseeds will be greatly increased.

To increase crop yields to the greatest extent possible can not only improve the cultural and material life of the province's more than 16 million people, but also enable the country to obtain more industrial raw materials and export goods. Therefore, I say that using all favorable conditions and taking all effective measures to increase crop yields will become a particularly important and glorious task for Shaanxi Province in future agricultural production.

There are many ways to increase crop yields, but based on the situation in Shaanxi in recent years, cultivating and promoting improved crop varieties is an important measure to increase crop yields.

Take wheat as an example. Shaanxi has successfully cultivated and promoted improved varieties, mainly Bima No. 1, 6028, and the recently cultivated 54. The first two have been extensively promoted. For example, taking Shaanxi's 23.91 million mu of wheat sowing area as 100, Bima No. 1 accounts for about 40%, 6028 accounts for about 30%, and other general varieties account for about 30%. In the future, all will be replaced.

The yields of both Bima No. 1 wheat and 6028 wheat are particularly high. Under the same conditions, Bima No. 1 yields more than 40% more per mu than ordinary varieties, and 6028 yields more than 30% more. If all of the province's 23.91 million mu of wheat are planted with improved varieties this year, the wheat yield can be increased by more than 1 billion jin. In 1954, more than 8 million mu of improved varieties were planted in Guanzhong, and this alone increased production by more than 300 million jin.

In recent years, Shaanxi's wheat has almost always had bumper harvests, and it is clear that this is inseparable from the large-scale promotion of improved varieties.

Bima No. 1 wheat is bred from Biyu wheat and Mazha wheat. Its stalks are thick and tall, more than a foot taller than ordinary varieties of wheat. It has no black smut disease, has strong drought resistance, and is suitable for dense planting (up to 480,000 plants per mu, 2-300,000 more plants per mu than ordinary varieties). It can grow normally even with insufficient fertilizer. The grains are large, the bran is thin, the flour quality is good, and the yield is particularly high. However, its insect resistance is not as good as that of 6028, and it is prone to lodging during the ripening period, or to germination and grain loss when encountering wind and rain. 6028 wheat is bred from Xinong No. 60 and No. 28. Its stalks are thick and short, and it is not easy to lodge after ripening. It also has no black smut disease, and its ability to resist insects, wind, and waterlogging is particularly strong. It is also suitable for dense planting. The ears of wheat are particularly large and the rows are particularly dense, with an average of 34-35 grains per ear, and some reaching as high as 102 grains. The yield is about 5-600 jin per mu, the yield is very high, and the quality is also particularly good. However, its drought resistance is poor, and it does not grow well when water and fertilizer are lacking. It is also prone to germination and grain loss when encountering wind and rain during the ripening period. No. 54 is bred from Northwest Station No. 2 and No. 302 in 1954, so it is called No. 54. More than 40 mu were planted this year for trial planting. Preliminary observations show that the growth is good, with all the advantages of Bima No. 1 and 6028. The yield is 15%-20% higher than that of Bima No. 1 and 6028. Some will be promoted this year.

Based on the characteristics of Bima No. 1 wheat and 6028 wheat and the planting experience in Shaanxi in recent years, Bima No. 1 can be planted in large quantities in dry land, and 6028 can be planted in irrigated land. Both of these types of wheat are suitable for dense planting and should be harvested early during the ripening period.

Based on the experience in recent years, when promoting improved wheat varieties, we should first pay attention to using concrete facts to educate the broad masses of farmers to recognize the benefits of cultivating and promoting improved varieties, thoroughly break down the ideological resistance to promoting improved wheat varieties, and also organize technical cadres to introduce to the peasant masses the experience and precautions in planting, harvesting, and field management, properly organize the allocation of improved varieties, and also pay close attention to conducting trial planting for one or two years before large-scale promotion of improved varieties, mastering the characteristics of the improved varieties, obtaining planting experience, and then promoting them on a large scale from point to surface.

From the above situation, it can be seen that cultivating and promoting improved crop varieties is very important, and we must continue to work hard in this area in the future to achieve greater results.

As for the agricultural production situation in Shaanxi Province, I think that changing the cropping system from two years and three crops to one year and two crops is another particularly important measure to increase yields. This is of equal significance to cultivating and promoting improved crop varieties.

Changing from two years and three crops to one year and two crops means changing the long-standing habit in Shaanxi Province of planting three crops in two years to planting two crops in one year. This method has now been implemented or is being vigorously implemented in many counties and districts in Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi. The results of the experiment show that not only can grain crops be harvested twice a year, but also cash crops can be harvested twice a year. For example, cotton intercropping in wheat fields or transplanting after wheat harvest has been successful through experiments. According to the experimental situation and the natural conditions of Shaanxi, the Guanzhong area and the southern Shaanxi basin, and even some areas in northern Shaanxi, can change from two years and three crops to one year and two crops.

If all of Shaanxi's 68,299,168 mu of cultivated land is completely changed to planting two crops a year, the increase in production will be staggering.

If it can be said that industrial and mining production, transportation, and other industries can find ways to save billions of dollars for the country, it can also be said that this revolutionary measure of changing Shaanxi's crops from two years and three crops to one year and two crops is also a great way for agriculture to increase billions of yuan of income for the country. In the future, we must put more effort and effort into such methods.

However, it should be pointed out that farmers in Shaanxi Province were not very accustomed to the farming method of planting two crops a year in the past. Even in the years since liberation, many peasants still have great resistance to these revolutionary measures in agriculture. After we did a lot of work, especially after the agricultural cooperation movement, and under the circumstances that things that were considered impossible in the past can now be done, the conservative ideas and resistance of the peasant masses in this area have been greatly overcome. For example, conservative and backward views and sayings such as "crop rotation can maintain soil fertility," "cotton cannot be replanted," "the growing season for replanting is short," "whether or not the harvest is guaranteed," and "to harvest 100 shi of grain, you must plant 100 mu of land" have not been completely overcome and broken. This requires us to do more and greater work.

In addition, I think that to increase crop yields, we must also overcome all shortcomings in our work. If we only pay attention to methods of increasing crop yields and do not pay attention to shortcomings in our work, it will have a great impact on increasing crop yields. We have many shortcomings in our work. As Vice Premier Deng pointed out in his speech, some of our cooperatives lack overall planning for production, attach importance to grain and cotton production, and neglect the production of other cash crops such as oilseeds, attach importance to agricultural production, and neglect sideline production; some institutions and organizations often invite some cooperative directors to meetings, make reports, introduce experiences, etc., which has a great impact on the production of some agricultural producers' cooperatives; some government departments are too hasty in their requirements for the development of various welfare undertakings of agricultural producers' cooperatives, resulting in the simultaneous advancement of various undertakings within some cooperatives, forming internal chaos; in particular, insufficient consideration is given to the physiological characteristics of women's labor; insufficient implementation of the policy of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, etc., also exist to varying degrees. Some of these shortcomings are quite serious. For example, the phenomenon of large numbers of livestock deaths due to improper use of livestock, poor management and feeding, and sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements is visible everywhere. Some of the above shortcomings have been overcome, and some are being vigorously overcome. We must continue to work hard to overcome all shortcomings, and pay close attention to preventing new shortcomings and errors from occurring.

Fellow delegates, our tasks in agricultural production are very arduous and also very glorious. We are fully determined and confident that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and with the great efforts of all cadres and the broad masses of peasants, we will follow the provisions of the Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperative Model Charter (Draft), which I fully agree with and recommend that the conference adopt, and the spirit of Vice Premier Deng's speech, to ensure that we do a good job in agricultural production, complete agricultural production tasks, and victoriously advance towards the infinitely beautiful prospects pointed out in the Forty Articles of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for the Development of Agriculture.

    陕西省是怎样提高农作物产量的
    ——韩兆鹗代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李副总理、廖部长、彭副委员长所作的报告和说明，除建议大会批准、通过外，我们在今后工作中一定要坚决贯彻执行。现在我想就我省提高农作物的产量问题上讲几点意见，请加指正。
    自1955年7月毛主席作了关于农业合作化问题的报告，10间中共中央七届六中全会通过并公布了关于农业合作化问题的决议以后，陕西省的农业合作化，经过几个高潮，也有了巨大的发展。截止今年4月底统计，已经加入农业生产合作社的农户，占到总农户的91.12％，其中高级农业生产合作社已经达到总农户的62.93％。农业合作化的这一巨大胜利，对于全省农业发展，特别对于提高粮食作物的产量是有重大意义的。
    由于农业合作化的巨大胜利，广大农民群众在思想上已经起了深刻的变化。例如蒲忠智代表所领导的长安县王莽村“七一”农业合作社，有个53岁的社员刘三海，他入了高级社后，兴奋地将他留了11年的胡子剃了，还编了一个快板说：“国民党，派夫、拉丁，不活就老，留胡子为避差讨饭也好；解放后分土地、搞互助，人人热闹，打粮食有饭吃年纪返小，因此上我将胡子干脆剃掉”。许敬章代表领导的兴平县豆马村豆马农业社600多个社员，在搜肥积肥期间经过几日夜的紧张劳动，不仅将长约2华里，宽约3公尺，有土约24，000车的旧城墙放倒，运到地里做为肥料，而且在几日之内又筑好了新城墙，劳动热情异常动人。该社有个双目失明、70多岁的老汉许运兴，兴奋地晚上睡不着，叫他的孙子打着灯笼带他去听社员们放城拉粪的紧张劳动，他向乡长激动地说：“我活了一辈子也没有经过这样大的世事”。其他如地主、富农和农村中的坏分子也都感动的有了极大的转变。
    农民群众在思想上这种深刻的变化也是大有利于农业生产的。例如西安市郊区红光农业生产合作社，附近有一条鲸鱼沟，要引水浇地不仅要穿过高塬，而且要越过深谷，历史上是办不到的事情。自从转社以后，社员们想尽了办法，克服了困难，在塬上凿了洞，在深谷里搭了渡槽，竟然修成了一条完整的渠道，引水灌溉，使7，000多亩旱地变成水地，今年增加的产量，不仅可以抵还修渠投资，而且还有盈余。类似这样的事例是举不胜举的。
    几年来，陕西省农业生产的增长速度是很快的。拿1949年作基数，到1955年（曾遭过春旱秋涝灾害）全省粮食产量已增加了37％；棉花产量提高了一倍多；大家畜增加了78％；造林面积扩大了15倍。
    在这样的基础上，再加合作化带来的一切有利条件和农业技术上的一切有效措施，我相信今后陕西农业生产将会得到更大的发展。特别是主要农作物如麦、棉、油料等的产量将会大大增加。
    极大限度地增加农作物的产量，不仅可以改善全省1，600余万人民的文化物质生活，而且可以使国家得到更多的工业原料和出口物资，因此我说利用一切有利条件和采取一切有效措施增加农作物的产量，将成为陕西省在今后农业生产当中一项特别重大的光荣任务。
    提高农作物产量的办法很多，但是根据陕西这几年的情况看，培育和推广作物良种是增加农作物产量的重要措施。
    就拿小麦来说，陕西已经培育成功，而且得到推广的良种主要有碧蚂一号、六○二八号，及最近培育成功的五四号。前两种已经得到了大量推广，如以陕西2，391万余亩小麦的播种面积为100，碧蚂一号约占40％左右，六○二八号占30％左右，其他一般品种占30％左右。今后将全部改换。
    碧蚂一号小麦和六○二八号小麦的产量都特别高。在同等条件下碧蚂一号比一般品种每亩产量高出40％多，六○二八号高出30％多。全省2，391万多亩麦子，如果今年全种良种就可以增产麦子10多亿斤，1954年关中种植良种面积800多万亩，只这一项就增产3亿多斤。
    这几年陕西小麦几乎年年丰产，显然可以看出与大量推广良种是分不开的。
    碧蚂一号小麦是由碧玉麦和蚂蚱麦配育成功的。它的杆子粗而高，比一般品种小麦高尺余，无黑穗病，抗旱能力强，宜于密植（每亩多至48万株，比一般品种每亩多二、三十万株），即肥料不足也能正常生长。颗粒大，麸皮薄，面粉质量好，产量也特别高。但抗虫能力不如六○二八号，成熟期间容易倒伏，或遇风雨容易发芽落粒。六○二八号小麦是由西农六○号与二八号配育成功的。它的杆子粗而矮，成熟后不容易倒伏，也无黑穗病，抗虫、抗风、抗涝的能力特别强，亦宜密植，麦穗特别大，排子特别稠，平均每穗有三十四、五粒，有的高达102粒，亩产约五、六百斤，产量很高，质量也特别好，唯抗旱能力差，水分和肥料缺乏时生长不甚良好，成熟期间如遇风雨也容易发芽落粒。五四号系由西北站二号与三○二号在1954年配育成功的，所以称五四号，今年试种40多亩，初步观察生长情况良好，具有碧蚂一号与六○二八号的一切优点，产量比碧蚂一号和六○二八号高出15％—20％多，今年将部分推广。
    根据碧蚂一号小麦和六○二八号小麦的特性与陕西近几年的播种经验看，碧蚂一号可以大量在旱地播种，六○二八号可以在水地播种。这两种小麦都宜于密植，在成熟期都应提早收割。
    根据这几年的经验看，在推广小麦良种时，首先应当注意用具体事实教育广大农民认识培育、推广良种的好处，彻底打破推广小麦良种的思想阻力，也必须组织技术干部向农民群众介绍播种、收获和田间管理的经验和应注意事项，妥善组织调配良种，还必须切实注意在大量推广良种之前，先行试种一两年，掌握了良种的特性，取得了种植的经验，然后再由点到面的大量推广。
    由上述情况看，培育和推广作物良种是非常重要的，我们今后还要在这一方面进一步努力，求得更大的成绩。
    再就陕西省的农业生产情况来说，我认为将农作物两年三熟改为一年两熟也是增加产量的又一项特别重大的措施。这与培育和推广农作物良种有同等重大的意义。
    两年三熟改为一年两熟，就是说将陕西省久已习惯的两年种三料作物改为一年种两料作物。现在在陕西关中和陕南盆地的许多县、区已经推行或正在大力推行这种办法。试验的结果，不仅粮食作物一年可以两熟，就是经济作物也可以一年两熟。如棉花在麦地里套种，或麦收后移植，经过试验都是成功的。根据试验情况和陕西的自然条件来看，陕西关中地区和陕南盆地甚至陕北部分地区都可以改变两年三熟为一年两熟。
    如果将陕西68，299，168亩的耕地完全改为一年种两料，那增产将是惊人的。
    如果说工矿生产、交通运输等能找到窍门为国家节约亿万资财，同样可以说像陕西农作物的改两年三熟为一年两熟这种革命性的措施，也就是农业上为国家增加亿万收入的一个很大窍门。今后我们要在这类窍门上再用心思再下工夫。
    但是应该指出，陕西省的农民过去对一年种两料的耕作方法，是不太习惯的。就是解放几年来农民群众有许多人仍然对于农业上这些革命性的措施抵触情绪还很大。经过我们做了很多工作，特别是经过农业合作化运动，在过去认为办不到的事情今天都能办到的情况下，农民群众在这一方面的保守思想和抵触情绪才有了很大的克服。例如：“倒茬才能保地力”、“棉花不能复种”、“复种生长季节短”、“能否收成不保险”、“要打百石粮，须种百亩地”等等保守落后的看法和说法还没有完全克服和打破。这就需要我们再做更多更大的工作。
    此外，我认为要增加农作物的产量还必须克服工作上的一切缺点。如果只注意增加农作物产量的办法，不注意工作上的缺点，对于增加农作物的产量就会有很大的影响。我们工作上的缺点是不少的。正如邓副总理在发言中指出，我们有些合作社对于生产缺乏全面规划，重视了粮棉生产，而忽视了其他经济作物如油料等的生产，重视了农业生产，而忽视了副业生产；有些机关、团体不时请某些社主任开会、作报告、介绍经验等，致使某些农业生产合作社的生产受到很大的影响；有些政府部门对于农业生产合作社各项福利事业的发展，在步骤上要求过急，致使某些农业生产合作社的各项事业，齐头并进，形成社内忙乱；尤其对于妇女劳动的生理特点，照顾不够；对于勤俭办社的方针贯彻不够等等缺点，也都程度不同的存在着。其中有些缺点还是相当严重的。如对牲畜使用不当，管理饲养不善和反革命破坏分子的抢害等，致使牲畜大量死亡的现象到处可见。上述这些缺点有些已经得到了克服，有些正在大力克服中，我们还要继续努力克服一切缺点，更要切实注意防止新的缺点和错误发生。
    各位代表，我们在农业生产上的任务是十分艰巨的，也是十分光荣的。我们完全有决心有信心在中国共产党和国务院的正确领导下，在全体干部和广大农民群众的高度努力下，遵照我所完全同意并建议大会通过的高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的规定和邓副总理发言中的精神，保证做好农业生产工作，完成农业生产任务，向着中共中央提出的发展农业四十条纲要所指出的无限美好远景胜利前进。
