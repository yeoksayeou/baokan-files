Tsinghua University Student Scientific Research Collection

    Palm-sized Radio
    Zhang Chong, a fourth-year student in the Radio Engineering Department, and his scientific research team, using the principle of new printed circuits, trial-produced a three-tube radio the size of a palm.

    Using a printing machine method, a circuit diagram is pre-designed on an insulating board. Then, a roller coated with a conductive substance is pushed across the board, printing the required circuit. After heat treatment, it becomes a complete circuit board. By simply installing a speaker and electron tubes, it becomes a radio.

    Light Bulb with Variable Intensity
    The New Light Bulb Research Group in the Industrial Enterprise Electrification Department designed a light bulb that can switch between two different intensities. This light bulb has two sets of filaments with different intensities, mounted on the bulb's head. Turning it to the left emits fifteen candlepower, and turning it to the right emits forty candlepower. The bulb's head is modified from the original, resulting in low cost and a long lifespan.

    Improving Planer Cutting Productivity
    Four fourth-year students from the Mechanical Manufacturing Engineering Department worked with workers from the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory to study the reasons for the low efficiency of the factory's planer when processing the body of the universal milling machine. The students designed a large infeed planer tool, a positioning attachment, and a fixture. Preliminary estimates suggest that these new tools can increase machine operator efficiency by about 100%. The factory has already adopted this tool, and other tools are also being prepared for adoption.

    КБ Adhesive
    The raw materials used for the adhesive for casting sand cores, tung oil and cooking oil, have high economic value. The scientific research group of fourth-year students in the Foundry Engineering and Machinery Department, after consulting relevant Soviet magazines and conducting multiple experiments, developed a type of adhesive called КБ adhesive using petroleum asphalt, which has lower economic value, as a substitute. Its mechanical properties are very good. (Xinhua News Agency)

    清华大学学生科学研究集锦
    手掌大的收音机
    无线电工程专业四年级学生张冲所在的科学研究小组利用新的印刷电路的原理，试制了一架只有手掌大的三灯收音机。
    它是根据印刷机的方法，在一块绝缘板上，预先设计好线路图样，然后用一只涂满某种导电体的滚筒在板上一推，需要的线路就印出来了，经过热处理就成为完整的线路底板。只要安上喇叭和电子管就成为一架收音机了。
    光度能变的灯泡
    工业企业电气化专业新灯泡研究小组设计了一种能变换两种强弱不同光度的灯泡。这种灯泡内有两组不同光度的灯丝，装在灯头上，向左转就发出十五支光，向右转就发出四十支光。这种灯泡的灯头是用原有灯头改装的，成本低，灯泡的寿命长。
  提高刨床切削生产率
    机械制造工程专业四年级四个学生和北京第一机床厂的工人们一起研究了这个工厂刨床在加工万能铣床的大身时，效率不高的原因。学生们设计了一把大送进刨刀，一个定位附件和夹具。经初步估计，这些新工具能使机工效率提高一倍左右。现在工厂已经采用这种刀具，其他工具也准备采用。
        КБ粘接剂
    铸造砂芯用的粘接剂用的原料桐油和食油，经济价值较高。铸造工程及其机械专业四年级的科学研究小组参阅苏联有关杂志，经过多次试验，研究出用经济价值较低的石油沥青作为代用品，做成一种叫做КБ粘接剂，机械性能很好。　（新华社）
