An editorial on the 1956 National Budget Report

The Third Session of the First National People's Congress opened yesterday. The main agenda of this meeting is to review and approve the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, and to discuss and adopt the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives. On these two agenda items, Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council and Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan made reports at yesterday's meeting. We will first offer some opinions on the former report for the readers' reference.

Every year, the national budget report inevitably lists a large number of figures, which may seem tedious to the average reader. However, these figures are essential, and behind them lies the great significance related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. How much money the state takes from the people each year, how it is taken, where it is used, why more is used here and less there, and what effects occur after it is used – all these questions can be roughly understood by carefully reading the budget report. Before liberation, the people could not know these things, especially not so accurately, completely, and clearly. Our government now makes such a faithful and detailed report to the people every year, which is a major event in the democratic life of our country. Moreover, since finance is determined by the economy, the annual budget report not only talks about financial revenue and expenditure, but also about the overall situation and direction of national construction, which is even more broadly related to the people. This year's budget report is less than 20,000 words long, and it is well worth the reader's time to spend an hour reading it.

There are several points in this year's budget report that are worth noting. One point is that this year's national budget revenue and expenditure have increased significantly. Budget revenue increased by 15.83% compared to last year, and budget expenditure increased by 22.77% compared to last year. Almost half of the budget revenue comes from the income of state-owned enterprises; and among the income of state-owned enterprises, the income of state-owned industries has increased the fastest compared to last year, reaching 31.27%. In terms of budget expenditure, economic expenditure accounts for more than half, of which industrial expenditure accounts for the largest proportion, followed by transportation expenditure, and then agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy expenditure. Among all expenditures, the total investment in capital construction amounts to 14 billion yuan, which is nearly half of the total expenditure of 30.7 billion yuan, accounting for the majority of economic construction expenditure, and increasing by as much as 62% compared to last year.

It can be seen that this year's national revenue plan and expenditure plan are both very active. This is an anti-conservatism budget, a budget to speed up construction, a budget that reflects the socialist upsurge and strives to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill the plan. There are conditions for realizing this budget, and the most important condition is the rapid growth of the national economy, that is, the high tide of socialist enthusiasm of the national workers, peasants, intellectuals, and all patriotic people. But it should also be seen that realizing this budget requires great efforts. Half of 1956 is almost over, and the efforts of the past six months have already achieved significant results, but there are also important shortcomings. The tasks for the next six months are even more important. All levels of the country, whether in completing the revenue plan or in realizing the construction plan, cannot allow complacency and slackness.

Another characteristic of this year's budget report, which can also be said to be the most noteworthy point of the report, is that while opposing conservatism, it puts forward the slogan of opposing rash advance. This is a conclusion drawn from summarizing the experience of implementing the national economic plan in the past six months. Therefore, the report says that this tendency has already occurred in many departments and many regions in the past few months. The tendency of rash advance exists in agricultural work. For example, the production increase plans of many agricultural cooperatives are too large, and they one-sidedly focus on grain and cotton while neglecting sideline occupations. Both productive and non-productive investments are too large. The scale of some cooperatives is too large, there is too much interference in the members, the requirements are too high, and not enough attention is paid to the increase of members' income and the health of female members. The tendency of rash advance exists in capital construction work. For example, the plans of many construction departments are too large, exceeding the limits of material and equipment supply, and the preparatory work simply focuses on the construction force. Many construction departments one-sidedly demand more and faster in the project, while neglecting good, economical, and safe. The tendency of rash advance exists in production enterprises. For example, the product plans of some production enterprises have not carefully studied the source of raw materials and the actual needs of users. Many enterprises also one-sidedly pursue more and faster in the production process, neglecting good, economical, and safe. In other aspects, such as certain aspects of commerce and cultural education, there are similar situations. This tendency of rash advance does not conform to the correct requirements of anti-conservatism, because anti-conservatism requires making full use of objective possibilities, not doing things that are impossible to do, and certainly not doing things that should not be done. Therefore, opposing rash advance does not mean allowing conservatism. The result of rash advance will inevitably lead to losses and hinder the realization of the national economic plan and the financial revenue and expenditure plan. It is timely to point out the tendency to prevent and correct rash advance to the people of the whole country in the budget report. It is hoped that the staff of organizations and departments at all levels across the country will seriously pay attention to this warning sign and correctly carry out the struggle on two fronts in their actual work—both opposing conservatism and opposing rash advance.

Another noteworthy feature of the budget report is the concern for the people's lives. The interests of our country are consistent with the interests of the people. This is the fundamental principle of the people's democratic system and the truth proved by the actual life of our country for more than six years since the founding of the country. But this does not mean that the government can guarantee that there are no shortcomings in this regard at any time and in any matter. In yesterday's report, Vice Premier Li examined the shortcomings in the government's work on wage issues and employee welfare issues in the recent period, and announced some relevant measures. At the same time, the report also discussed several issues concerning the lives of farmers and private industrialists and businessmen. In this year's budget expenditure, there has been a large increase in economic and cultural construction expenditure, while defense expenditure has decreased; in economic construction expenditure, agricultural expenditure has increased a lot; in industrial expenditure, in addition to continuing to give priority to the development of heavy industry, light industry expenditure has also increased a lot; the budget expenditure in ethnic minority areas has also grown faster than in general areas. All these are manifestations of the government's emphasis on improving the people's lives on the basis of developing production and gradually realizing national industrialization. We hope that all relevant departments will earnestly implement the various measures determined by the government to improve the people's lives. At the same time, we hope that all enterprises, trade union organizations, cooperatives, and all other relevant parties will also work hard within their respective scope of activities to ensure that the policies of the Party and the government can be implemented.

Of course, there is more to discuss about this year's budget and budget report. What we are saying to the readers in this article is only "to cite one corner" of the matter. We believe that after reading Vice Premier Li's report, everyone will greatly deepen their understanding of the country's current economy and finance, thereby greatly strengthening their belief and enthusiasm in completing the 1956 national economic plan and national budget.

### 读1956年国家预算报告

    读1956年国家预算报告
    第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议，已经在昨天开幕了。这次会议的主要议程是审查和通过关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，讨论和通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程。关于这两项议程，昨天的会议上已经有国务院李先念副总理和农业部廖鲁言部长分别作了报告。我们现在先就前一个报告说一点意见，供读者参考。
    每年的国家预算报告都不免要罗列一大堆数字，对于一般读者恐怕会有枯燥之感。但是这些数字固然是不可少的，而且在它的背后，实在有关系国计民生的重大意义在。国家每年从人民取多少钱，怎样取法，又用在什么地方，为什么这里多用，那里少用，用了以后究竟发生什么效果，这些问题，只要把预算报告细看一遍，都可以知道一个大概。在解放以前，人民是不可能知道这些的，尤其不可能知道得这样确实、完全和清楚。我们的政府现在每年向人民作一次这样忠实详尽的报告，这是我们国家的民主生活中的一件大事。而且由于财政决定于经济，所以在每年的预算报告中，不但讲到财政收支，还讲到国家建设事业的总的情况和方针，同人民的关系更为广泛。今年的预算报告不到两万字，读者花一个钟头的时间读一下是完全值得的。
    在今年的预算报告中有几点可以注意的地方。一点是今年的国家预算收支增长很大。预算收入比去年增长15.83％，预算支出比去年增长22.77％。预算收入的几乎半数是国营企业收入；而国营企业收入中，又以国营工业收入比去年增长最快，达到31.27％。在预算支出方面，经济支出占半数以上，其中工业支出比重最大，其次是交通运输支出，再次是农林水利支出。在各项支出中，基本建设的投资的总额达140亿元，将近支出总额307亿元的半数，占经济建设支出的大部，比去年增长达62％之多。
    可以看出，今年的国家收入计划和支出计划都是很积极的。这是反保守主义的预算，这是加紧建设的预算，这是反映社会主义高潮、争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的预算。实现这个预算是有条件的，最重要的条件就是国民经济的迅速增长，就是全国工人、农民、知识分子和一切爱国人民的社会主义积极性的高涨。但是也应该看到，实现这个预算，必须付出巨大的努力。1956年的一半已经快要过去了，过去的半年的努力已经有了显著的成绩，但是还有重要的缺点。今后的半年的任务更加重大。全国上下，无论在完成收入计划方面，或者是在实现建设计划方面，都不能容许自满和懈怠。
    今年的预算报告的另一个特点，也可以说是报告的最值得注意的一点，是在反对保守主义的同时，提出了反对急躁冒进的口号。这是总结了过去半年中执行国民经济计划的经验得来的结论，所以报告里说，这种倾向在过去几个月中，在许多部门和许多地区，都已经发生了。急躁冒进的倾向存在在农业工作中，例如许多农业合作社的增产计划过大，而且片面地着重粮棉而忽视副业，生产和非生产的投资都过多，一部分合作社的规模过大，对社员的干涉过多，要求过高，对社员收入的增加和女社员的健康注意不够。急躁冒进的倾向存在在基本建设工作中，例如许多建设部门的计划过大，超过了材料和设备供应的限度，而准备工作又单纯地偏重了施工力量，许多建设部门在工程中片面地要求多和快，而忽视好、省和安全。急躁冒进的倾向存在在生产企业中，例如一部分生产企业的产品计划没有详细研究原材料的来源和用户的实际需要，许多企业在生产过程中也是片面地追求多和快，忽视好、省和安全。在其他方面，例如商业和文化教育事业的某些方面，也有类似的情形。这种急躁冒进的倾向并不符合于反保守主义的正确的要求，因为反保守主义是要求充分利用客观的可能，并不是要求做不可能做的事情，当然更不是要求做不应该做的事情。因此，反对急躁冒进，也决不是容许保守主义。急躁冒进的结果必然招致损失，妨碍国民经济计划和财政收支计划的实现。在预算报告中向全国人民指出防止和纠正急躁冒进的倾向，是切合时宜的。希望全国各级组织和各个部门的工作人员，都认真地重视这一个警号，在实际工作中正确地进行两条战线的斗争——既反对保守主义，又反对急躁冒进。
    预算报告中又一个值得注意的特点，是对于人民生活的关切。我们的国家的利益是同人民的利益相一致的，这是人民民主制度的根本原则，也是我国建国六年多以来的实际生活所证明的真理。但是这并不是说，政府在任何一个时候和任何一件事情上，都能保证在这一方面没有缺点。李副总理在昨天的报告中，检查了最近时期政府在工资问题和职工福利问题的工作中的缺点，并且宣布了一些有关的措施。同时，报告还讨论了关于农民生活和私营工商业者生活的若干问题。在今年的预算支出中，经济和文化建设的支出都有大量的增加，而国防支出却减少了；在经济建设费中，农业支出增加很多；在工业支出中，除了继续优先发展重工业外，轻工业支出也增加很多；少数民族地区的预算支出，也比一般地区增长得快些。所有这些，都是政府在发展生产逐步实现国家工业化的基础上，重视改善人民生活的表现。我们希望各个有关部门切实地执行政府所决定的各项改善人民生活的措施，同时希望各企业、各工会组织、各合作社和其他一切有关方面也在各自的活动范围内多多努力，使党和政府的方针能够贯彻实现。
    关于今年的预算和预算报告，可以讨论的当然不止这一些。我们向读者说这一篇话，也只是“举一隅”的意思。我们相信，大家读了李副总理的报告，一定可以大大加深对于国家当前的经济和财政的认识，从而大大加强对于完成1956年国民经济计划和国家预算的信念和积极性。
