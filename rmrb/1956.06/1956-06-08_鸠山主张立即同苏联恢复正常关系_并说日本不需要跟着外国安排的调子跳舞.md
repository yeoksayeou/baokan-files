    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama stated at a press conference yesterday that he hopes to immediately achieve normalization of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. He advocated for first concluding a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, leaving the territorial issue to be resolved later.
    Hatoyama believes that it may be necessary to change Japan's negotiation plan with the Soviet Union. He believes that the territorial issue should be postponed until the world's tense situation further eases in the future. He said that when this relaxation occurs, the problem will not be difficult to solve.
    The day before Hatoyama made this statement, the Japanese government had decided to continue negotiating with the Soviet Union according to the previous "established policy." News reports said that the so-called "established policy" is to still insist on resolving pending issues such as the territorial issue first, and then concluding a peace treaty with the Soviet Union. United Press reported that Hatoyama's attitude "will be contrary to the views of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, who believes that all issues, including the territorial issue, must be resolved before signing a peace treaty."
    Ichiro Hatoyama said at the press conference that he hopes to rely on the efforts of those in the Liberal Democratic Party who advocate for the early restoration of relations with the Soviet Union to seek a consensus on the peace treaty issue. He believes that once those who advocate for the early restoration of diplomatic relations become the majority, those opposing opinions will certainly be rejected.
    When talking about the issue of restoring contact between Japan and the Soviet people, the Prime Minister expressed his belief that after normalization of relations, the Soviet Union would not want to cultivate communism in Japan.
    He said that some people worry that Moscow will use its future embassy in Tokyo as a base of operations to engage in "various activities," which is a "fear of communism disease." He said that if Japan becomes friends with the Soviet Union through restoring contact, this worry will be eliminated.
    When reporters asked how the Prime Minister considered Japan's relationship with the United States due to negotiations with the Soviet Union, Hatoyama replied that Japan will continue to develop into a free and independent country and does not need to dance to the tune arranged by the Soviet Union or the United States.

    鸠山主张立即同苏联恢复正常关系
    并说日本不需要跟着外国安排的调子跳舞
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎昨天在记者招待会上表示，他希望立即实现同苏联的邦交正常化。他主张，先和苏联缔结和约，把领土问题留待以后解决。
    鸠山认为，改变一下日本同苏联的谈判方案可能是必要的。他认为，关于领土问题应该推迟到世界紧张局势得到进一步缓和的未来再行解决。他说，当这种和缓出现时，这个问题不会是一个难于解决的问题。
    在鸠山发表这次谈话的前一天，日本政府曾经决定继续按照以前的“既定方针”同苏联谈判。消息说，所谓“既定方针”就是仍然坚持首先解决领土问题等悬案，然后再同苏联缔结和约。合众社报道说，鸠山表示的态度“将是同外务相重光的观点相违背的，重光认为一切问题都必须在签订和约以前得到解决，其中包括领土问题。”
    鸠山一郎在这次记者招待会上说，他希望依赖自由民主党中那些主张早日和苏联恢复关系的人的努力来求得对和约问题的意见一致。他认为，一旦主张早日恢复邦交的人占多数的时候，那些反对的意见一定会被否决。
    谈到日本同苏联人恢复联系问题时，这位首相表示相信在关系正常化以后，苏联不想在日本培植共产主义。
    他说，某些人担心莫斯科将要利用它将来在东京的大使馆作为活动基地，从事“各种活动”，这是一种“恐共产党病”。他说，如果日本通过恢复联系同苏联结为朋友的话，这种担心就会消除。
    当记者问到由于同苏联谈判，首相对日本同美国的关系怎样考虑的时候，鸠山回答说，日本将继续发展成为一个自由独立的国家，而不需要跟着苏联或者美国安排的调子跳舞。
