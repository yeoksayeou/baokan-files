Editor's Note: The Central-South Operations Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives was completely abolished in March of this year, but their inventory of pickled mustard and tree ear fungus has not yet been transferred. Whose responsibility is this? According to our understanding, both sides of the handover have their own arguments. The person in charge of the former Central-South Operations Office said: According to the regulations of the State Council, the vegetables managed by the supply and marketing cooperatives should be transferred to the state-owned commercial departments for acceptance; there is no reason for the commercial departments of Hubei Province to refuse to accept this batch of pickled mustard and tree ear fungus. The Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce’s argument is: Why does the Central-South Operations Office only know to transfer the accumulated goods according to regulations, but not transfer the relevant staff and storage equipment along with the goods? The Central-South Operations Office is not an organization of a single province, so why should we, the commercial department of Hubei Province alone, accept this batch of goods?

Of course, both sides' arguments are "reasonable," so the dispute has not been resolved for several months. However, in the process of the dispute, the pickled mustard has already begun to rot due to long-term backlog and poor management. In order not to cause losses to state property, couldn't we first process this batch of goods and then inspect the problems in the handover work? If it is said that it cannot be sold within Hubei Province, it should also be organized for sale as much as possible, and reported to the higher authorities for transfer to other regions for sale. Doing so would be better than allowing the goods to be backlogged for a long time and rot.

This matter should really not be delayed any longer. It is recommended that the Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives immediately negotiate to resolve this issue. To the editor:

According to the State Council’s decision at the end of last year regarding the transfer of vegetables to state-owned commercial departments for unified management, the Central-South Operations Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives needs to transfer 3.6 million jin of pickled mustard and 600,000 jin of tree ear fungus to the specialized company under the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce for management. However, from the beginning of the transfer in January of this year, it has been five months now, and the Department of Commerce has been refusing to accept this batch of goods. The reason is: the Department of Commerce believes that the quantity of pickled mustard is too large, and the commercial system itself also has a backlog of tree ear fungus, which cannot be sold within the province.

In order to solve this problem, the person in charge of the Central-South Operations Office has repeatedly gone to the Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to request instructions on how to handle it. The Ministry of Commerce sent a telegram to the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce on April 17, requesting them to accept it, and explaining that the central government could transfer it after acceptance. However, the Department of Commerce still refused to accept it, and also raised reasons such as wanting cadres and warehouses. Currently, the climate in Wuhan is getting hot, and the storage conditions for this batch of vegetables are not good. Some of the pickled mustard piled up in the open air has already begun to mold. If we do not actively find ways to deal with it, it will all rot! Therefore, I believe that the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce should no longer delay this matter. They should quickly accept and arrange the sale of this batch of vegetables.

### 再争执下去，大批榨菜要霉烂了

    再争执下去，大批榨菜要霉烂了
    编者按：全国供销合作总社中南经营处的机构已经在今年三月全部撤销了，但是他们库存的榨菜和木耳却至今还没有移交出去。这是谁的责任呢？据我们了解，交接双方各有各的说法。原中南经营处的负责人说：按照国务院规定，供销社经营的菜蔬应该移交国营商业部门接收；湖北省商业部门拒绝接受这批榨菜和木耳是没有道理的。湖北省商业厅的说法则是：中南经营处为什么只知道按规定移交积存的商品，却不把有关工作人员和仓储设备随着商品交出来呢？中南经营处又不是一省的机构，为什么却要我们湖北一个省的商业部门来接受这批商品呢？
    当然，双方的说法都是言之成“理”，于是争执了好几个月也没有解决问题。但是，在争执的过程中，榨菜已经因为长期积压、管理不善而开始霉烂了。为了不使国家财产受到损失，难道不可以先把这批商品进行处理以后再来检查接交工作中的问题吗？如果说湖北省省内推销不了，也应该尽可能地组织推销，并且报请上级调往其他地区销售，这样做无论如何要比听任商品长期积压而致霉烂要好。
    这件事情的确不应该再拖延下去了。建议商业部和全国供销合作总社立刻协商解决这个问题。编辑同志：
    根据国务院去年年底关于蔬菜移交国营商业部门统一经营的决定，全国供销合作总社中南经营处库存榨菜三百六十万斤、木耳六十万斤需要移交给湖北省商业厅所属的专业公司经营。但是从今年一月开始办理移交起，到现在五个月了，商业厅一直拒绝接收这批货物。原因是：商业厅认为榨菜数量过大，木耳在商业系统本身也有积压，省内推销不了。
    中南经营处负责人为了解决这个问题，曾多次到商业部和全国供销合作总社请示处理办法。商业部在四月十七日曾打电报给湖北省商业厅，要求他们接收，并说明接收后可以由中央外调。但是商业厅仍旧不肯接收，同时又提出了要干部、要仓库等理由。目前武汉气候转热，这批菜蔬的仓储条件又不好，堆放在露天里的部分榨菜已经开始霉变，如果再不积极设法处理，就要全部霉烂！因此我认为湖北省商业厅不应该再把这件事拖延下去了，他们应该迅速接收和安排销售这批菜蔬。
