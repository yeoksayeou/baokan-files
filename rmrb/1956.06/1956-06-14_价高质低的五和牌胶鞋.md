The expensive and low-quality "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes

    Li, a demobilized soldier from Xianjiazhai in the Laoshan suburbs of Qingdao, bought a pair of "Wuhe" brand high-top sneakers from the No. 9 retail store of the local supply and marketing cooperative. Like most people, he took special care of his new shoes. However, in less than four hours of wearing them, the "big tendon" (rubber front edge) of the shoe detached from the sole and lifted up. He went to the cooperative that same day to return the shoes, complaining that the cooperative was not selling good products.
    These shoes were produced by the state-owned Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 in 1955. The quality of all kinds of "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes produced by this factory is also poor. Many farmers need to buy rubber shoes, but they are reluctant to buy "Wuhe" brand Hercules shoes. One consumer wore "Wuhe" brand Hercules shoes from Qingdao to Jimo (a distance of ninety li), walked back and forth twice, and the sole wore through. A shop assistant at the Qingdao Zhengtade Department Store said: Customers only buy "Wuhe" brand shoes with a sigh when they really can't buy any other brand.
    However, in Qingdao and some other areas, people welcome "Feipeng" brand rubber shoes and "Shanghai Warrior" and "Double Coin" brand rubber shoes, which are produced by the joint state-private Qingdao Fuxingxiang Rubber Factory and the joint state-private Shanghai Dachina and Zhengtai Rubber Factories. Why are "Feipeng" and other brands of rubber shoes popular with consumers, while "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes are not? As people say, "You don't have to know goods, you're only afraid of comparing goods," there is a significant difference in the quality of these two types of shoes: "Wuhe" brand Hercules shoes have a narrow body, which makes them tight on the feet; the soles are rough, uneven, and the rubber content of the outsoles is also relatively small; the shoes are lighter than "Feipeng" brand Hercules shoes; and the sizes are also insufficient. These quality shortcomings of "Wuhe" brand Hercules shoes are basically not found in "Feipeng" and other brands that people are willing to buy. In terms of price, comparing shoes of the same size, the purchasing price of "Wuhe" brand by commercial departments is 2% higher than "Feipeng" brand, and even higher than the same specifications of products in Shanghai. Even people who have never worn these shoes, who would be willing to buy such low-quality and expensive shoes! According to a department store in Qingdao, a worker once went to buy Hercules shoes, and the salesperson introduced him to the "Wuhe" brand, but he refused, saying: I know this kind of shoe better than you do. It turned out that he was a worker at the Rubber Factory No. 9.
    "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes are not popular with the masses, and sales have plummeted in recent years. According to incomplete statistics from the Qingdao Wholesale Station of the China General Merchandise Company, taking the sales volume of "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes in 1953 as 100, it decreased by about 50% in 1954 and 70% in 1955. The state-owned Laixi Department Store sold an average of 4,000 pairs per month in 1954 and 1,200 pairs per month in 1955, and currently the monthly sales volume is only 50 pairs. Under these circumstances, commercial departments have a large backlog of inventory. In Shandong Province's state-owned general merchandise company system alone, there are more than 1.2 million pairs in stock.
    The people of Shandong need a large number of rubber shoes. In order to meet the needs of the people, state-owned commercial departments, despite having a large backlog of "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes in warehouses, have to transfer in a large number of rubber shoes from other regions.
    How can the negative impact of "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes in the market be reversed? How can the products of the state-owned Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 be adapted to the needs of consumers and produced for the needs of consumers? How can the production of the state-owned Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 9 be further developed? The key issue is: to learn from advanced products, quickly take effective measures, work hard to improve, and continuously improve the quality of "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes and reduce production costs.

    价高质低的五和牌胶鞋
    靳吾
    青岛崂山郊区仙家寨一个姓李的转业军人，向当地供销合作社第九零售店买了一双五和牌大长球鞋。他跟一般人一样，特别爱护新鞋。然而，他穿了不到四个小时，鞋前的“大梗子”（前沿橡胶）便脱离鞋底，掀了起来。他当天就到合作社去，一面退货，一面抱怨合作社不卖好货。
    这种鞋是国营青岛橡胶九厂1955年的产品。这个厂生产的各种五和牌胶鞋的质量也都不好。许多农民需要买胶鞋，但是都不愿买五和牌的力士鞋。有一个消费者穿着五和牌力士鞋从青岛走到即墨（相距九十华里），走了两个来回，底就穿通了。青岛市正泰德百货店的一个店员说：顾客实在买不到别的牌子的鞋，才叹口气买双五和牌的。
    但是在青岛和其他一些地区，人们欢迎飞鹏牌胶鞋和上海回力牌、双钱牌的胶鞋，那是公私合营青岛复兴祥橡胶厂和公私合营上海大中华、正泰橡胶厂生产的。为什么飞鹏牌等胶鞋受到消费者欢迎，而五和牌胶鞋不受欢迎呢？正如人们所说的：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货”，这两种鞋在质量上有着显著的差别：五和牌力士鞋鞋身瘦小，穿在脚上，前头轧脚；鞋底又粗糙，凹凸不平，而且大底的含胶量也较小；鞋的重量比飞鹏牌力士鞋轻；尺码也不足。五和牌力士鞋质量方面的这些缺点，飞鹏牌和人们愿买的其他牌子基本是没有的。在价格上，拿同样尺码的鞋做比较，商业部门的进货价格，五和牌还比飞鹏牌高2％，比上海同规格的产品更高。即使没有穿过这种鞋的人们，谁又愿意买这种质低价高的鞋呢！据青岛一个百货商店反映，曾经有一个工人去买力士鞋，售货员给他介绍五和牌，他不要，还说：这种鞋我可比你们清楚。原来他就是橡胶九厂的工人。
    五和牌胶鞋不受群众欢迎，销售量几年来急遽下降。据中国百货公司青岛批发站不完全统计，以1953年五和牌胶鞋的销售量为100，1954年下降了约50％，1955年下降了70％。国营莱西百货公司1954年平均每月销售四千双，1955年平均每月销售一千二百双，到目前每月的销售量只有五十双了。在这种情况下，商业部门大量积压，仅山东省国营百货公司系统就积压一百二十万双以上。
    山东人民需要大量的胶鞋。为了满足人民的需要，国营商业部门虽然在仓库里积压着大量的五和牌胶鞋，却又不得不从其他地区调进大量的胶鞋。
    怎样挽回五和牌胶鞋在市场上的不良影响呢？怎样使国营青岛橡胶九厂的产品适应消费者的需要，做到为消费者需要而生产呢？怎样使国营青岛橡胶九厂的生产能够获得进一步的发展呢？关键问题是：要向先进的产品看齐，迅速采取有效措施，努力地改进、并且不断地提高五和牌胶鞋的质量，降低生产成本。
