    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 11th. A land fissure occurred in Shengang Township, Yihuang County, Jiangxi Province in late May. According to the person in charge of the Yihuang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the fissure's opening extended from a small hillside to the village below, spanning approximately five *hua li* in length, with cracks one to two *chi* wide. Some houses near the fissure tilted or collapsed, trees leaned, and over one hundred *mu* of paddy fields experienced cracking and water leakage, with more than ten *mu* rendered uncultivable due to severe water loss. After the fissure occurred, the leading organs of Yihuang County dispatched personnel to investigate and made proper arrangements for the affected farmers.
    The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee have also dispatched a group of scientific and technical personnel with expertise in geology to the site to conduct on-site investigations and research.
