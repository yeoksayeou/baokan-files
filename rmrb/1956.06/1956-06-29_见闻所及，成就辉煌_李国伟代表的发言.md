I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

In the past year, thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country has undergone fundamental changes. With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural and handicraft cooperation and the development of the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises across the country, the enthusiasm of the people across the country for building socialism has been greatly encouraged; there is a definite certainty that we will complete and over fulfill our country’s first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The great socialist construction is developing vigorously everywhere, which is greatly gratifying!

Now, please allow me to talk about the fast, good, and economical socialist construction I have seen, to express my heartfelt excitement and support.

When I went to Shaanxi Province in April to participate in the board meeting of the joint state-private venture Xinqin Enterprise Company, I was encouraged by the local authorities because I had been a railway engineer and had worked in the Baoji factory making air-raid shelter spinning mills. Therefore, the Railway Bureau specially sent an engineer to accompany me to visit the Qinling Grand Tunnel of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway to increase my knowledge. This large tunnel runs from the ancient Dashanguan to Dongheqiao. The railway winds through 57 kilometers in the Qinling Mountains, with more than 40 tunnels totaling more than 34 kilometers. Tunnels are built above tunnels, and tunnels are built beside tunnels, in the shape of the Chinese character "儿" and in a spiral shape, traversing and ascending slopes with the steepest gradient of 30 per thousand - an average of 25.5 per thousand - passing through the main vein of the Qinling Mountains. This is one of the most difficult projects in the world. Because of the help of the Soviet Union's advanced experience, it was decided to use electric locomotives to propel trains; the most economical and steepest gradient was adopted to reduce tunnels, shorten routes, and save basic construction costs. It will be officially connected on July 1 this year. I realized that only in the era of Chairman Mao could such a great socialist peaceful construction be seen. In just two and a half years, a natural barrier has been transformed into a thoroughfare, truly making the high mountains bow their heads, giving people endless excitement! And receiving endless convenience!

In Baqiao, on the eastern outskirts of Xi'an, I visited the state-owned cotton textile factory. The two factories that have already started production have about 200,000 spindles, and those under construction will also have nearly 200,000 spindles. The four factories are connected together, with nearly 400,000 spindles and 10,000 looms of new equipment; the affiliated employee welfare facilities are perfect. This is one of the key textile industries in the Northwest. In the six years since liberation, Shaanxi Province has focused on expanding the cotton textile industry: Xi'an, Xianyang, Caijiapo, Baoji and other places have added spindles and looms more than seven times the original number, adding more than 600,000 spindles in total. This is just the rapid development of Shaanxi Province alone. Recalling that before liberation, the two imperialist powers, Britain and Japan, relied on their unequal treaty talisman and strong economic power, and spent more than 50 years building only 1.1 million spindles in the semi-colonial treaty port of Shanghai. Our socialist construction, in just one corner of the country, used one-tenth of the time to build more than half of its textile industry, which is unimaginable in capitalist countries.

The southern suburbs of Xi'an are the school district, with specialized schools for geology, coal mining, petroleum, civil engineering, architectural engineering, automobile machinery, highway construction, electrical engineering, animal husbandry, etc., standing one after another; the Northwest Medical College, Northwest Power College, and Shaanxi Normal College are all large in scale. The previously gloomy Xi'an has been transformed into a vibrant new base for culture and science; correcting the previous abnormal state of concentrating institutions of higher learning in coastal cities.

In late May, I participated in an inspection in Hubei Province. I saw the construction of the piers of the Yangtze River Bridge, using the newest pipe pile construction method to replace the arduous and slow old caisson construction technology. This is the creation of new socialist construction by using the law of scientific development, advancing the completion date; this is inseparable from the selfless assistance of Soviet technology. I remember that around 1920, the reactionary government invited the American bridge consultant engineer Waddell to Hankou to plan the Yangtze River Bridge. At that time, I participated in the discussion as a member of the Engineers Association, but it was never heard from again and no construction was ever mentioned. Now it has been completed in just two or three years. What a miracle, truly an unprecedented initiative!

In Dujiatai, Mianyang, I observed the Han River diversion project. This huge project, which protects 11.68 million mu of cultivated land in the lower reaches of the Han River from floods, was rushed through in a short period of six months with a labor force of more than 150,000 people. Such rapid progress can only be achieved in the era of the Communist Party, when the people are the masters of their own affairs and protect their own wealth, can they build this meaningful project with selfless labor.

During an inspection of the state-run Shayang Farm, Wusan Mechanical Farm, and Shilong Reservoir, I saw wasteland turned into fertile fields, from nothing to something, from something to more; Shayang Farm has reclaimed more than 400,000 mu, and Wusan Farm has reclaimed more than 100,000 mu. On one side of the fields, the crops are harvesting golden wheat ears, and on the other side, the green rice seedlings have been planted. Being among them is indescribably happy. Especially the Shayang Reform-Through-Labor Farm, only in the new China can prisoners be transformed into new people. Performing meritorious service and expiating crimes in reform-through-labor does not seem like being a prisoner. The farm is self-sufficient in everything: it has a good hospital, a clothing factory, an electric power plant, a construction site... there is learning, there is entertainment, there is a cultural troupe. Every year, each illiterate person is required to learn 500 characters, and prisoners with high cultural levels share the teaching work. As a result, the prisoners are greatly moved. After the sentence expires, they are unwilling to return to their hometowns. More than 400 people are willing to be new people and continue to work on the farm, and some have moved their families to live together. In the Newcomer Village, we felt that the scenery was quiet and clean, making every inspector reluctant to leave. If you don't experience it yourself, how can you see the virtue of the People's Government. However, the two farms also have shortcomings: one is that there is no veterinarian, and when livestock get sick, they cannot be treated, resulting in unavoidable casualties! The second is that the terrain has not been leveled, so the mechanization of cultivation and harvesting cannot be fully utilized? They are gradually trying to improve. The Shilong Reservoir can store 80 million cubic meters of water, which can irrigate 250,000 mu. It is said that the Shimen Reservoir is also under construction nearby, and the irrigation area is even larger, reaching 450,000 mu, and there is also small-scale hydropower generation. This large-scale water conservancy construction is countless throughout the country, which can not only store floods, but also prevent droughts, so crops will increase every year and there is no need to worry about poor harvests.

After this inspection, I deeply realized the brilliant achievements of socialist construction. After listening to the report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, I further realized the deep concern of the Party and the People's Government for the interests of the people; this expresses the superiority of the people's democratic system. Therefore, our industrialists and businessmen are sincerely willing to accelerate the socialist transformation. We individuals must also do a good job in budgeting and accounting to save unnecessary expenses and not waste useful funds. We have a common goal and a common wish to strive for the early completion of national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and national defense modernization to peacefully build a better socialist society!

    见闻所及，成就辉煌
    ——李国伟代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告、廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明和彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    一年以来由于共产党和毛主席的正确领导，我们国家起着根本的变化，随着农业和手工业合作化高潮的到来和全国私营工商业社会主义改造的开展，鼓舞了全国人民对于建设社会主义的高度热情；提前完成和超额完成我国第一个五年计划是有了确切的把握。伟大的社会主义建设蓬蓬勃勃地在各处发展，是大大地可以欢欣庆贺的！
    现在请允许我就我见闻所及谈谈又多又快又好又省的社会主义建设，以表达我衷心的兴奋和拥护。
    我在4月间到陕西省参加公私合营新秦企业公司的董事会议时，得了地方当局的鼓舞，以为我曾当过铁路工程师，又在宝鸡厂内做了防空隧道的纺纱工场，因此特地由路局派了工程师陪我参观宝成铁路的秦岭大隧道以增长我的见识。这个大隧道从古大散关起至东河桥止，铁路蜿蜒于秦岭山区57公里中，凿了40多个山洞共长34公里有余，洞上凿洞、洞旁复洞，有儿字形、有螺旋形，辗转升坡，以千分之三十的最陡坡度——平均千分之二五点五——度过秦岭主脉，为世界上最艰巨工程之一。因为得到了苏联先进经验的帮助，决定了用电气车头推进列车；采用最经济的最陡坡度以减少隧道、缩短路线，节省基本建设的费用。今岁7月1日正式接轨。我体会到只有在毛主席时代，能够见到了这样伟大的社会主义和平建设。在短短的两年半中化天险为康庄，真是使高山低头，使人有无穷的兴奋！受到无穷的便利！
    在西安东郊灞桥地方参观了国营棉纺织厂，已经开工的两个厂约有20万纱锭，正在建设中的亦将近20万纱锭。4个厂毘连一起，有将近40万锭和1万台布机的新颖设备；附属的职工福利设备都完美无缺。这是西北纺织重点之一。陕西在解放后六年中重点扩建棉纺织工业：西安、咸阳、蔡家坡、宝鸡等处增添纱锭布机比旧有的超出7倍以上，约共增添60余万纱锭。这仅就陕西一省而言，就有此种突飞猛进的发展。回忆解放前英日两帝国主义挟其不平等条约的护符，和经济势力的雄厚，费了50多年的时间，在上海半殖民地的通商大埠上才做了110余万的纱锭。我社会主义的建设仅在一隅之地用十分之一的时间就做了它半数以上的纺织工业，这是资本主义国家所不能想像的。
    西安南郊是学校区，有地质、煤矿、石油、土木工程、建筑工程、汽车机械、公路建设、电机、畜牧等等的专科学校，一所接一所地矗立着；西北医学院、西北动力学院和陕西师范学院等规模宏大。解放以前暮气沉沉的西安，一变而为朝气勃勃的文化科学新基地；纠正以前高等学校集中在沿海城市的不正常状态。
    5月下旬我参加了湖北省的视察。看了长江大桥的桥墩建筑，以最新颖的管桩施工法来代替了沉箱施工艰苦迟缓的旧技术。这是运用科学的发展规律创造社会主义的新建设，提早完工时期；这是和苏联的技术创造无私援助分不开的。我记得大约在1920年时，反动政府就请美国桥梁顾问工程师华台而到汉口计划长江大桥，那时我曾以工程师协会会员身份参加讨论，乃以后寂然无闻，再不提起兴建了。今于短短的二、三年中就加以完成，这是何等的奇迹，真是史无前例的创举！
    在沔阳杜家台观察汉江分洪工程。这个保障汉江下游耕地面积1，168万亩免于水灾的巨大工程是在劳动力15万多人工作六个月的短时期内抢修而成的。这种迅速的进度，惟有在共产党时代，人民当家作主，保护好自己的财富，才能以忘我的劳动兴建这个有意义的工程。
    在国营沙阳农场、五三机械农场和石龙水库视察，见到荒地变为良田，从无到有，从有到多；沙阳场已垦40多万亩，五三场已垦10万多亩。田间农作物一面正在丰收金黄色的麦穗，一面已将绿油油的稻秧栽好。置身其间有说不尽的高兴。尤其对沙阳劳改农场只有在新中国拿犯人化为新人，在劳改中立功赎罪竟不像是犯人。该场样样自给自足：有很好的医院、有被服厂、有电灯电力厂，有建筑场……有学习、有娱乐、有文工队。文盲每年每人规定识字500个，由犯人中文化水准高的分担教导工作。因此犯人大为感动，刑期满后亦不愿回乡，已有400多人愿做新人在农场继续工作，有的已迁家同住。我们在新人村觉得风景幽静，整洁无尘，使视察者个个留恋，舍不得离开。像这种情景，若不亲历其境怎能看到人民政府的德政。但两个农场亦有缺点，一是没有兽医，遇牲畜患病时无法医除，以致不免伤亡！二是地形尚未整理平正，不能尽量利用机械耕获？正在逐渐设法改善中。石龙水库可畜水八千万立方公尺，可以灌溉25万亩。据云附近尚有石门水库正在兴工，灌溉之区更多，能达45万亩，且有小型的水力发电。这种大规模的水利建设，在全国各地不胜枚举，既可蓄洪，又可防旱，所以农作物就会年年增产而不愁欠收了。
    我经过了这次视察，深刻地认识到社会主义建设的辉煌成就，听了1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，更进一步认识到党和人民政府对于人民利益的深切关怀；这表达了人民民主制度的优越性。因此我们工商业者心悦诚服地愿意加速社会主义改造。我们个人也要做好预算决算来节约不必要的开支，不浪费有用的资金。我们有共同的目标，共同的愿望，为提早完成国家工业化、农业合作化和国防现代化来和平建设美好的社会主义社会而努力！
