I have listened to Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and the important speeches of the central leaders. I deeply realize that our country's financial revenue and expenditure are balanced, the economic foundation is stable, all socialist construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds every day, and the care for all ethnic groups is meticulous. Taking the three expenditures of road construction, education, and health in minority areas in 1955 alone, it amounted to more than 173.4 million yuan. In addition to fully agreeing with and wholeheartedly supporting it, I am deeply grateful for the state's care and concern for our ethnic minorities!

I am a member of a minority ethnic group from the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan. I will only speak about the work situation in the Dehong area in the past year under the glorious guidance of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies: Inspired by the great socialist revolution upsurge in the motherland, by the end of last year, in the Dai ethnic areas and other ethnic areas with similar socio-economic structures to the Dai in the six border counties, according to the demands of the broad masses of the people and with the support of public figures of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we adopted the method of peaceful consultation and successfully completed the land reform work, enabling farmers with little or no land to receive an average of about 800 kilograms of rice equivalent production of land per person, thereby abolishing the old system that had long hindered the development of all ethnic groups in the Dehong area and liberating rural productive forces. This has created basic conditions for working together with all fraternal ethnic groups to build our great motherland and gradually transition to socialist society. At the same time, appropriate arrangements and care have also been given to ethnic public figures who have connections with the masses, in accordance with the policy of "unity, education, and transformation." After the land reform, a mutual aid and cooperation movement was launched. As of April this year, in areas where peaceful consultation on land reform has been completed, 369 agricultural production cooperatives have been established, with 8,804 households participating, of which Dai households accounted for 12% of Dai households. In the Jingpo, Lisu, and Benglong ethnic areas, which do not require land reform, with the strong support of the people's government, the approach of direct transition was adopted in accordance with the principles of "unity, production, and progress." Now 72 directly transitioned agricultural production cooperatives have been established, with participating households accounting for slightly more than 5% of the farmers in the area. In the four inland counties newly merged, the Han and other ethnic areas, because the land reform ended earlier, the farmers participating in the cooperative have now reached 86.2% of the farmers in the area.

In May of this year, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the approval of the State Council, the four counties of Baoshan, Tengchong, Longling, and Changning were merged and changed to the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture. The population has increased to 1.51 million, thus making the Dehong area appear with an unprecedented new look. This will enable the ethnic minorities in the border areas to receive more direct help and support from the Han people, and the unity among ethnic groups and within ethnic groups will be further consolidated. It is more possible for ethnic minorities in the border areas to rapidly develop political, economic, and cultural undertakings and transition to socialist society at an early date. Therefore, the patriotic consciousness and socialist enthusiasm of all ethnic groups have been unprecedentedly high, and a red-hot mutual aid and cooperation movement and patriotic production increase movement have been launched.

The Dehong area is a place with fertile land and a good climate. The prefecture has more than 60 million mu of land, of which the arable land area is about 8 million mu, while the land currently cultivated is only 3.51 million mu, accounting for 5.85% of the total land area and 44% of the arable area. There is still a lot of fertile wasteland, which is not only suitable for the development of food crops, but also suitable for the development of many cash crops. We are now planning to gradually develop these wastelands under the strong support of the state, tap the potential of production, and strive to reach a grain output of 3,207.5 million jin by 1962, an increase of 238% compared with 1955; cotton 42 million jin, an increase of 42 times compared with 1955; coffee 60 million jin, tea 20 million jin, sugar cane 2 billion jin, flue-cured tobacco 75 million jin, hemp 10 million jin, agave and sisal 30 million jin, castor 10 million jin, silk 1.44 million jin, shellac 10 million jin, walnut oil 960,000 jin, and fragrant fruit oil 1.4 million jin. The total output value of grain, cash crops, forest specialties, and animal husbandry is 498 million yuan, an increase of more than 7 times compared with 1955. Before liberation, there was no industry in the Dai area of Dehong. Now the prefecture has 40 factories and mines such as power plants, coal plants, iron plants, farm tool manufacturing plants, and oil mills (of which 21 are in the Dai area). This year's total output value is 3.86 million yuan. In 1957, it is planned to build 30 new factories, adding to the existing 40 for a total of 70. The total output value will reach 15.26 million yuan, an increase of 295% compared with 1956.

The cultural and educational work has also developed rapidly. There are currently 974 primary schools with 105,291 students, accounting for 44.7% of school-age children, an increase of 50,618 people compared with before liberation. In the six border counties, the number of primary schools has increased by 5 times compared with before liberation. There are 9 middle schools (including 2 ethnic middle schools), with 3,850 junior high school students and 650 senior high school students, an increase of 44% compared with before liberation. The prefecture has a total of 750,000 young and middle-aged people. Now 1,415 people's schools have been established, with 3,821 people's teachers, more than 100 literacy teams, and more than 200,000 young and middle-aged people have enrolled in school, accounting for 26% of the number of young and middle-aged people. We strive to eliminate illiteracy among the Han and Jingpo ethnic groups within seven years, and among the Dai ethnic group within five years. Although the number of primary and middle schools has increased significantly compared with before liberation, it is still far from meeting the needs. The people have made requests to us in this regard. Therefore, it is planned to increase the number of primary school students by 23,077, junior high school students by 842, and senior high school students by 120 in 1956, and increase the number of primary school students by 45,357, junior high school students by 3,500, and senior high school students by 500 in 1957. By 1960, all school-age children will have the opportunity to attend school. Two normal schools have been established, and it is planned to add another ethnic normal school. In 1956, the number of junior normal school students will be increased by 256 and the number of middle normal school students by 200. This will be increased year by year in the future.

In terms of health work, the prefecture has a total of 593 health cadres, an increase of 18 times compared with before liberation, 2,034 Chinese medicine practitioners and herbal doctors. Over the past six years, a total of 8,469 disease prevention and health care workers have been trained, and 6 hospitals have been established with 410 beds, an increase of 8 times compared with before liberation. Due to the continuous strengthening of health work and the improvement of people's lives, the incidence rate last year decreased by 31.7% compared with 1953. The "malaria disease" that has harmed the people of the prefecture the most has been greatly reduced, and the mortality rate has also been greatly reduced. However, the people's suffering from diseases still needs to be further eliminated. It is planned to basically eliminate plague, dysentery, malaria, typhoid, cholera, and measles by 1962. At the same time, the level of primary health cadres will be raised to the intermediate level, and another group of health workers will be trained, especially ethnic health workers, which is even more important. We strive to have a health station in every district within seven years, a health worker and midwife in every large commune, and a health care worker in every production team.

Fellow delegates, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the higher-level people's government, all work in the Dehong area has achieved great success. The people of all ethnic groups in the border areas, like the fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, have seen a happy, fulfilling, bright, and splendid future. However, we still have many shortcomings, mainly: Due to the lack of experience of cadres, the masses are not yet familiar with cooperatives, and some upper-level people, landlords, and rich peasants still have some concerns, so the enemy takes the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage. In addition, the politics, economy, culture, and production technology of the ethnic minorities in the border areas are relatively backward. The outstanding problems are the inability to manage cooperatives well and the inability to be careful in calculations. In terms of industry, there is a lack of technical personnel, the plans are not thorough, and some products are of low quality and cannot be sold, which affects the completion of the plan. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and the higher-level people's government, with the strong support of the state, with the help of the Han people, and with the joint efforts of more than 1.5 million people in the prefecture, these shortcomings can be overcome, and the above tasks can definitely be completed. Our ethnic minorities in the border areas will also transition to socialist society together with the fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, and will contribute all their strength to strive for the early and over-fulfillment of the country's first five-year plan and to strive for the realization of the country's great twelve-year long-term plan!

    云南省德宏地区的新面貌
    ——刀京版代表的发言
    我听取了李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”、廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”、彭真副委员长关于“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”及中央各位首长的重要发言以后，深深体会到我国的财政收支是平衡的，经济基础是稳定的，各项社会主义建设事业是一日千里的突飞猛进，对于各民族的照顾是无微不至的，单以1955年在少数民族地区修公路和教育、卫生事业的三项支出来说，就达17，340余万元之多，我除完全同意和衷心拥护外，深深的感激国家对我们少数民族的照顾和关怀！
      我是云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州的少数民族，我仅就德宏地区在共产党和毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，一年来的工作情况作如下的发言：德宏自治州在祖国伟大的社会主义革命高潮的鼓舞下，到去年年底，在边疆六个县的傣族和社会经济结构与傣族相同的其他民族地区，根据广大人民群众的要求和各民族公众领袖人物的赞助，我们在共产党的领导下，采取了和平协商的方式，已经胜利地完成了土地改革工作，使无田少田的农民每人平均分得了年产约800斤稻谷的土地，从而废除了长期阻碍德宏地区各民族发展的旧制度，解放了农村生产力。为和各兄弟民族一道共同建设我们伟大的祖国，逐步过渡到社会主义社会创造了基本的条件。同时对于与群众有联系的民族公众领袖人物，也根据“团结、教育、改造”的政策，给予适当的安置和照顾。土改结束后，随即掀起了互助合作运动，截至今年四月份，在和平协商土改已结束的地区，建立起了农业生产合作社369个，入社农户8，804户，其中傣族入社农户占傣族农户的12％。在不需要土地改革的景颇族、傈僳族和崩龙族等其他民族地区，则在人民政府的大力扶持下，根据“团结、生产、进步”的方针，采取直接过渡的办法，现在已办起72个直接过渡的农业生产合作社，入社农户占该地区农民的5％强。在新合并进来的内四县汉族和其他民族地区，则因土改结束较早，现在参加合作社的农民已达该地区农户的86.2％。
    今年五月，我们根据宪法的规定和国务院的批准，将保山、腾冲、龙陵、昌宁等四县，合并改为德宏傣族景颇族自治州以后，人口增加到151万人，这样就使德宏地区出现了空前未有的新面貌，使边疆各少数民族将获得汉族人民更多的直接帮助和支援，各民族之间和民族内部的团结将获得进一步的巩固，边疆各少数民族就更有可能迅速的发展政治、经济、文化事业，早日过渡到社会主义社会，因此各族人民的爱国主义觉悟和社会主义积极性空前高涨，掀起了热火朝天的互助合作运动和爱国增产运动。
    德宏地区是一个土地肥沃、气候良好的地方，全州共有土地6，000多万亩，可耕田地面积约800多万亩，而现在耕种的土地只有351万亩，占土地总面积5.85％，占可耕面积44％，还有很多肥沃的荒地，不仅适宜发展粮食作物，而且也适宜发展许多经济作物。我们现在规划，要在国家的大力扶持下，逐步地开发这些荒地，发掘生产潜在力，争取到1962年粮食产量达320，750万斤，比1955年增产238％，棉花4，200万斤，比1955年增产42倍，咖啡6，000万斤，茶叶2，000万斤，甘蔗20亿斤，烤烟7，500万斤，麻1，000万斤，龙舌兰和剑麻3，000万斤，蓖麻1，000万斤，蚕丝144万斤，紫胶1，000万斤，核桃油96万斤，香果油140万斤。粮食、经济作物、林木特产和畜牧等项产值合计49，800万元，比1955年增加7倍多。解放前德宏的傣族地区是没有什么工业的，现在全州已有电力、煤厂、铁厂、农具制造厂、榨油厂等厂矿40个（其中在傣族地区的21个），今年总产值为386万元，1957年计划新建厂30个，连原有的40个共计70个，总产值将达到1，526万元，比1956年增加295％。
    文教工作方面也发展得很快，现有小学校974所，学生105，291人，占适龄儿童44.7％，比解放前增加了50，618人，在边疆六县地区的小学校比解放前增加了5倍。中学9所（包括民族中学2所），初中生3，850人，高中生650人，比解放前增加44％。全州共有青壮年75万人，现在已办起民校1，415所，民师3，821人，扫盲队100多队，入学的青壮年已有20余万人，占青壮年人数的26％，争取汉族、景颇族七年内，傣族五年内扫除文盲。虽然小学和中学比解放前都有很大的增加，但离需要还很远，人民已向我们提出这方面的要求，因此计划1956年增加小学生23，077人，初中生842人，高中生120人，1957年增加小学生45，357人，初中生3，500人，高中生500人。到1960年适龄儿童都将有入学的机会。现已办师范学校两所，拟再增办民族师范学校一所，1956年增加初师学生256人，中师学生200人，今后还要逐年增加。
    卫生工作方面，全州共有卫生干部593人，比解放前增加18倍，中医和草医2，034人、六年来共训练了防疫员、保健员8，469人，建立了医院6所，病床410张，比解放前增加8倍。由于不断的加强卫生工作和人民生活的改善，去年发病率比1953年降低了31.7％，为害全州人民最大的“摆子病”已大大减少，死亡率也大大的降低了，但人民的疾病痛苦，还须要进一步的消除，计划到1962年基本消除鼠疫、痢疾、摆子、伤寒、霍乱和麻疹病，同时将初级卫生干部提高到中级水平，再训练一批卫生人员，特别是民族卫生人员更为重要，争取七年内每一个区有一个卫生站，每一个大社有一个卫生员和接生员，各个生产队有一个保健员。
    各位代表，德宏地区在共产党和上级人民政府的正确领导下，各项工作已取得了很大的成就，边疆各族人民和祖国各兄弟民族一样，看到了幸福美满、光明灿烂的前途，但是我们存在的缺点还很多，主要是：由于干部缺乏经验，群众对合作社尚不熟悉，部分上层和地主、富农尚有一些顾虑，因此敌人便从中造谣破坏；加以边疆各少数民族的政治、经济、文化和生产技术都比较落后，突出的问题是对合作社不善于经营管理和不善于精打细算，在工业方面缺乏技术人员，计划不周到，有些是产品质量低销售不出去，影响了计划的完成。我们相信，在党和上级人民政府的正确领导下，在国家的大力扶持下，有汉族人民的帮助，有各民族的紧密团结，全州150多万人的共同努力，以上这些缺点是能够克服的，上述的任务是一定能够完成的，我们边疆少数民族，也将同祖国各兄弟民族一道，过渡到社会主义社会，并将贡献一切力量，为提前和超额完成国家第一个五年计划而努力，为实现国家伟大的十二年远景规划而奋斗！
