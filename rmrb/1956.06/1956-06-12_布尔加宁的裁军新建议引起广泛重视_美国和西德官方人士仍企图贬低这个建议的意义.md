Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS news, Bulganin's letters to the heads of government of Western countries on the issue of disarmament have received widespread attention from newspapers in France, Britain, and the United States.

All Paris morning papers published detailed summaries of Bulganin's letter. Some Paris newspapers also emphasized the significant international implications of the Soviet government's new initiative. "L'Aurore" called for "serious study of the conditions for rapprochement between East and West and increased contact."

The diplomatic correspondent of the British "Times," in commenting on Bulganin's letter, criticized the U.S. side's attitude. He said, "Dulles has already said that further reductions in the number of armed forces are not in line with the interests of the United States." The commentator believes that the reason the United States is afraid to reduce the number of its armed forces is because it fears "it cannot maintain its currently widely dispersed bases."

In the United States, all New York newspapers published the news about Bulganin writing to Eisenhower in a prominent position.

It can be seen from the Associated Press reports that U.S. officials have begun to use the same old methods to undermine the great interest in the Soviet proposals. These people insist that Bulganin's new letter on the disarmament issue is a kind of "propaganda." The report said that Washington "authorities" believe that the letter seems to contain "no new suggestions that can break the long-standing deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Bulganin's letter to the heads of government of Western countries has aroused widespread repercussions in Germany.

The newspapers of the German Democratic Republic all welcomed the Soviet Union's new initiative. "Neues Deutschland" said: Bulganin's letter contains concrete proposals aimed at breaking the deadlock in disarmament negotiations. The newspaper pointed out that Bulganin's proposal to Western countries to greatly reduce the number of foreign troops stationed on German territory or withdraw these troops is of particularly great significance to the German people. "National-Zeitung" said that these proposals are also a new contribution to resolving the German question.

According to an Associated Press report from Bonn, West German government officials view the Soviet Union's recent disarmament proposals with skepticism. However, the commentary published by the press office of the West German Social Democratic Party on Bulganin's letter warned against dismissing Bulganin's letter as mere propaganda. The commentary believes that it shows the Soviet people sincerely hope for disarmament. The sincere desire of the Soviet Union to generally ease international tensions should be considered.

The Associated Press said, "These comments indicate that there are now huge differences of opinion among West German politicians regarding Russian policy."

Xinhua News Agency, June 11th dispatch: TASS reported that the Czechoslovak "Prace" published a commentary on Bulganin's letter on the issue of disarmament, saying that the Soviet Union is proving its commitment to peace and ensuring the security of all peoples not with words but with actions. "Prace" pointed out that Bulganin's letter is of great significance to the resolution of the German question. Because Germany is where the armed forces of both sides confront each other, if the number of armed forces in Germany can be reduced, it will greatly affect the development of the situation in this restless region of Europe.

Newspapers in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary also welcomed Bulganin's new proposals.

    布尔加宁的裁军新建议引起广泛重视
    美国和西德官方人士仍企图贬低这个建议的意义
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社消息：布尔加宁就裁军问题给西方国家政府首脑的信件，受到法、英、美各国报纸的广泛重视。
    巴黎全部晨报都刊登了布尔加宁信件的详细摘要。一些巴黎报纸还强调指出苏联政府的新倡议的重大国际意义。“震旦报”号召“认真研究东西方接近的条件和增多接触”。
    英国“泰晤士报”外交评论员在评论布尔加宁的信件的时候指责美国方面的态度。他说，“杜勒斯已经说过，再减少武装部队的人数是同美国的利益不相符的”。这个评论员认为，美国之所以害怕减少自己的武装部队人数，是因为担心“它不能维持目前广泛散布的基地”。
    在美国，纽约所有的报纸都在显著地位刊登了关于布尔加宁写信给艾森豪威尔的消息。
    从合众社的消息中可以看出，美国官方人士已经开始采用老一套的办法，来破坏对苏联的建议的巨大兴趣。这些人硬说布尔加宁关于裁军问题的新信件是一种“宣传”。消息说，华盛顿“权威人士”认为，信中似乎“没有任何能够打开美苏之间在裁军问题上的由来已久的僵局的新建议”。
    据新华社讯　布尔加宁给西方国家政府首脑的信件，在德国引起广泛的反响。
    民主德国的报纸都欢迎苏联的新倡举。“新德意志报”说：布尔加宁的信里包含着目的在于使裁军问题的谈判摆脱僵局的具体建议。这家报纸指出，布尔加宁向西方国家提出的关于大大减少德国领土上外国驻军人数或者撤走这些军队的建议，对德国人民有特别重大的意义。“国民日报”说，这些建议对解决德国问题也是一个新的贡献。
    据美联社波恩消息说，西德政府官员们以怀疑的态度来看待苏联最近的裁军建议。但是，西德社会民主党新闻处就布尔加宁的信件发表的评论里警告说，不要把布尔加宁的信件看作只是一种宣传而置之不理。新闻处的评论里认为，这表明苏联人真心希望裁军。应该考虑苏联要求普遍缓和国际紧张局势的真诚愿望。
    美联社说，“这些评论表明现在西德政界人士中存在着对俄国政策的巨大分歧。”
    据新华社11日讯　塔斯社报道，捷克斯洛伐克“劳动报”就布尔加宁关于裁军问题的信件发表评论说，苏联不是用言词，而是用行动证明它在致力于和平和保障各国人民的安全。“劳动报”指出，布尔加宁的信对解决德国问题有重大意义。因为德国就是双方武装部队对峙着的地方，如果能够裁减在德国的武装部队人数，就会在相当大的程度上影响欧洲的这个不安静的地区的事态的发展。
    罗马尼亚、保加利亚和匈牙利的报纸也对布尔加宁的新建议表示欢迎。
