Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th—Chen Jingkai, the lightest weightlifter of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, broke the world record for the lightest weight class jerk with a result of 133 kg in Shanghai on the 7th. The previous record was 132.5 kg, set by American athlete R.H. Wynch in Munich in 1955.

This is the first time a Chinese athlete has broken a world record.

Chen Jingkai broke this world record during a friendly match between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Shanghai weightlifting team against the Soviet weightlifting team held in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 7th.

The weight of the barbell that Chen Jingkai lifted when he broke the world record today was measured before the competition and proved to be fully compliant with the standard. After breaking the world record, Chen Jingkai's body weight was measured as 55.5 kg, which did not exceed the stipulated standard of 56 kg.

Two of the three referees today were international referees from the Soviet weightlifting team, N. Kochelev and Yan Sparre.

Chen Jingkai lifted 133 kg on his third jerk attempt today. When he lifted this barbell weighing more than twice his body weight, all three white signal lights indicating success lit up simultaneously. After he put down the barbell, the referees excitedly lifted him up, and the Chinese and Soviet weightlifters in the audience ran up to hug him. More than three thousand spectators stood up and applauded enthusiastically.

Chen Jingkai's snatch result today was 87 kg, his clean and jerk result was 85 kg, and his total weightlifting result was 305 kg. This total score also broke the national record of 295 kg for the lightest weight class. (Photo attached)

    最轻量级举重运动员陈镜开双手挺举133公斤
    新华社上海7日电　中国人民解放军的最轻量级举重运动员陈镜开，七日在上海以133公斤的成绩，打破了美国运动员温奇1955年在慕尼黑创造的最轻量级双手挺举132.5公斤的世界纪录。
    这是中国运动员第一次打破世界纪录。
    陈镜开是七日下午参加在上海举行的中国人民解放军和上海市举重联队同苏联举重队举行的一场友谊比赛中，打破这项世界纪录的。
    陈镜开今天打破世界纪录时候所举的杠铃的重量，在比赛前经过称量，证明完全合乎标准；打破世界纪录以后，出场称量陈镜开的体重是五十五点五公斤，没有超过五十六公斤的规定标准。
    今天担任裁判的三个裁判员中，有两个是苏联举重队中的国际裁判尼·科歇列夫和扬·斯帕雷。
    陈镜开今天在第三次挺举的时候举起了133公斤。当他举起这个重量超过他体重一倍以上的杠铃以后，三个表示成功的白信号灯同时亮了起来。当他放下杠铃以后，裁判员们兴奋地把他抬了起来，在场的中、苏两国举重运动员跑上来同他拥抱。三千多名观众起立热烈鼓掌。
    陈镜开今天双手推举的成绩是八十七公斤，双手抓举的成绩是八十五公斤，他的举重总成绩是305公斤。这个总成绩还打破了最轻量级举重总成绩295公斤的全国纪录。（附图片）
