Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: According to the Korean-Chinese side's proposal, the Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on June 7th. Major General Zheng Guolu suggested at the meeting that both sides of the Military Armistice Commission express the following two points to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission: 1. The authority of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams is an inseparable part of the armistice agreement and must not be altered. 2. The withdrawal of inspection teams from both North and South Korea is a temporary measure; when either side of the armistice makes a substantiated accusation against the other side for violating the armistice agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has the right to dispatch inspection teams to reside in specific ports.

Major General Zheng Guolu requested that the U.S. side agree to the Military Armistice Commission's affirmative response to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's June 5th letter regarding the temporary withdrawal of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, based on the above two points.

However, at the meeting, the U.S. side repeated the same old hypocritical claims that had already been thoroughly refuted by the Korean-Chinese side, and rejected the just and reasonable proposals of the Korean-Chinese side.

Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out that the U.S. side's attempt to illegally deprive the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams of their authority is a serious violation of the armistice agreement. The U.S. side cannot escape the responsibility for seriously violating the armistice agreement.

Zheng Guolu pointed out that after the U.S. side rejected the proposals of the Chinese and Korean governments to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea, it then unilaterally announced that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams must withdraw from South Korea within a week, and rejected the Korean-Chinese side's legitimate proposal for the temporary withdrawal of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. This clearly shows that the U.S. side is planning to further arm the Syngman Rhee clique. This seriously threatens the armistice agreement and, furthermore, threatens peace and security in Asia.

Zheng Guolu warned the U.S. side that if the U.S. side disregards everything and destroys the armistice agreement, the U.S. side will bear full responsibility for all the consequences.

    朝中方面同意暂时撤回中立国小组
    指出必须维护中立国监察委员会和视察小组职权
    新华社平壤8日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：根据朝中方面的建议，朝鲜军事停战委员会在六月七日举行了会议。郑国禄少将在会上建议军事停战委员会双方向中立国监察委员会表示以下两点：一、中立国监察委员会和它的视察小组的职权是停战协定的不可分割的一部分，不准对它有所变更。二、视察小组从朝鲜南北双方撤回，是暂时的措施；当停战双方中的任何一方，就另一方违反了停战协定的事件作出有根据的指责时，中立国监察委员会就有权派遣视察小组驻在特定口岸。
    郑国禄少将要求美方同意军事停战委员会根据上述两点，对中立国监察委员会六月五日关于暂时撤回中立国视察小组的信作出肯定的答复。
    但是，美方在会议上却重复早已经被朝中方面彻底驳斥了的老一套的虚伪主张，并且拒绝了朝中方面的正当而合理的建议。
    郑国禄少将指出，美方企图非法剥夺中立国监察委员会和它的视察小组的职权是严重违反停战协定的非法行为。美方绝不能摆脱严重违反了停战协定的责任。
    郑国禄指出，美方在拒绝了中朝两国政府关于召开有关国家会议协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜等问题的建议后，接着就片面宣布中立国视察小组须在一个星期内撤出南朝鲜，并且拒绝了朝中方面关于暂时撤回中立国视察小组的正当建议，这清楚地说明了美方在策划进一步武装李承晚集团。这严重地威胁着停战协定，并且进而威胁着亚洲和平和安全。
    郑国禄警告美方说，如果美方不顾一切地破坏停战协定，美方将要对这一切后果负全部责任。
