Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 24th: Syrian Republic President Kuwatly said, "We cherish the deepest gratitude for the lofty attitude taken by the Soviet Union on the issues of the Arab world."

Kuwatly said in his speech at the banquet he hosted for Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov on June 23rd: I would like to take this good opportunity to assure you that Syria is very happy and receives its friends with sincere friendly feelings. Syria answers love with love, answers sincere relations with gratitude, and extends a friendly hand to everyone who responds to it in the same way.

Shepilov delivered a reply speech. Among those attending the banquet were Syrian Prime Minister Asali, Foreign Minister Bitar, Speaker of Parliament Kudsi, cabinet ministers, members of parliament, other senior Syrian government officials, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Syria.

In his speech, Kuwatly also said that Syria is willing to establish close cooperation with all countries that "respect justice and freedom, and safeguard the lofty principles of humanitarianism." He emphasized that Syria hopes to strengthen the unity of Arab countries.

Kuwatly said, "Syria stands with the people who are fighting for freedom and self-determination. In order to realize this noble proposition, we hope to achieve deeper mutual understanding and cooperation with the people of all countries. We also hope to consolidate our friendly relations with the Soviet Union on this healthy basis."

Kuwatly expressed his belief that Shepilov's visit to Syria is "a new development in the road of mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries."

In his reply speech, Shepilov said that we hold sincere friendly and profound respect for the Syrian people, who, together with other Arab countries, have written a glorious page in the history of the Eastern peoples' struggle for independence. The increasingly firm determination of the freedom-loving Eastern countries to carry the struggle for independence to the end is of great progressive significance.

Shepilov pointed out that in order to maintain their positions, the colonialists are trying to repaint the old facade of the decaying building of colonialism, and they are looking for new ways to enslave the peoples of Asia and Africa. He said that the establishment of aggressive military blocs like the Baghdad Pact, as you know, is one of these methods, and Syria is particularly feeling the pressure of the Baghdad Pact. But the people of all countries who have experienced the happiness of freedom and independence and recognized their own strength will never be driven into colonial enslavement again.

In refuting the various speculations spread by some people about his visit to the Near and Middle East, Shepilov said, I am willing to reveal to you the "secret" of my mission to the Near East. The Soviet Union is not looking for military bases for itself here, because it fundamentally opposes the establishment of military bases on the territory of other countries. The Soviet Union is not seeking oil or any other leases for itself here, because it fundamentally opposes any form of economic enslavement. The Soviet Union not only does not intend to spread any factors of distrust among Arab countries, but also advocates that Arab countries have the greatest reconciliation and unbreakable friendship. The Soviet Union not only does not intend to make Arab countries quarrel with Western countries, but also, due to its adherence to its policy of defending world peace, it is unswervingly striving to ease international tensions in the Near East and the Middle East.

The Soviet government has consistently and sincerely supported the desire of Arab countries to further strengthen the national independence they have recently achieved and improve their economic well-being. The Soviet Union believes that the consolidation of the independence of the Arab Eastern countries and the general development of these countries are important guarantees for peace and security in this region.

It is precisely because of this that the Soviet government is happy to sympathize with and support the desire of the governments of the aforementioned countries to achieve these goals. The basis of the Soviet government's relations with the countries in this region is the just principles declared by the peoples of Asian and African countries at the Bandung Conference.

Shepilov said that we held talks with the national leaders of Syria in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and sincerity on important issues such as the international situation, the situation in the Near and Middle East, and Soviet-Syrian relations. We believe that these talks will be beneficial to our two countries, beneficial to peace, and will strengthen the cause of international trust and practical cooperation.

    苏叙会谈国际局势和两国关系
    叙总统说：这是苏叙互相了解和合作道路上的新进展
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社大马士革二十四日消息：叙利亚共和国总统库阿特利说，“我们对苏联在阿拉伯世界的问题上所采取的崇高态度怀着最深刻的感谢心情。”
    库阿特利六月二十三日在他招待苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫的宴会上致词说：我想乘这个良好的机会向你保证，叙利亚是很高兴和怀着真挚友好的感情来接待自己的朋友的。叙利亚以爱来回答爱，以感谢的心情来回答真挚的关系，它向每一个用同样态度回答它的人伸出友好的手。
    谢皮洛夫致了答词。出席宴会的有叙利亚总理阿萨利、外交部长比塔尔、议会议长库德西、各部部长、议会议员和叙利亚政府其他高级官员以及各国驻叙利亚的外交使节。
    库阿特利在致词时还说，叙利亚愿意同“尊重正义和自由、卫护人道主义高度原则”的所有国家建立紧密的合作。他强调指出，叙利亚希望加强阿拉伯国家的团结。
    库阿特利说，“叙利亚是同为自由和自决权而斗争的人民站在一起的。为了实现这种崇高的主张，我们希望同各国人民取得更深刻的相互了解和合作。我们希望也在这种健康的基础上巩固我们同苏联的友好关系”。
    库阿特利表示相信，谢皮洛夫的访问叙利亚是“两国互相了解和合作道路上的新进展”。
    谢皮洛夫致答词时说，我们对叙利亚人民抱着真挚友好和深刻尊敬的情感，叙利亚人民同其他阿拉伯国家一起在东方人民争取独立的斗争历史上写下了光荣的一页。爱好自由的东方各国人民把争取独立的斗争进行到底的日益坚定的决心是具有重大的进步意义的。
    谢皮洛夫指出了，为保持自己的阵地，殖民主义者正尝试重新粉刷殖民主义的腐朽建筑的旧门面，他们正在寻找奴役亚非各国人民的新方式。他说，建立像你们知道的巴格达条约这一类的侵略性军事集团就是这些方式之一，叙利亚是特别感觉到巴格达条约的压力的。但是体会了自由和独立的各种幸福和认识了自己的力量的各国人民，决不会再被驱入殖民奴役的境地。
    在驳斥某些人散布的关于他访问中近东的种种揣测的时候，谢皮洛夫说，我愿意向你们泄露我来近东的使命的“秘密”。苏联在这里没有为自己寻找军事基地，因为它根本反对在别国的领土上建立军事基地。苏联在这里没有为自己寻求石油和任何其他的租借权，因为它根本反对任何形式的经济奴役。苏联不但不打算在阿拉伯各国之间散布任何不信任的因素，而且主张阿拉伯各国有最大的和解和牢不可破的友谊。苏联不但不打算使阿拉伯国家同西方国家争吵，而且由于忠于自己的保卫世界和平的政策，它在不屈不挠地争取缓和近东和中东地区的国际紧张局势。
    苏联政府过去和现在一贯真诚而全心地支持阿拉伯各国对进一步加强不久以前取得的民族独立和提高他们的经济福利的愿望。苏联认为，阿拉伯东方国家的独立的巩固和这些国家的普遍发展是这个地区的和平和安全的重要保障。
    正因为这样，苏联政府乐于同情和支持上述国家的政府达到这些目的的愿望。苏联政府同这个地区的国家的关系的基础是亚非国家的人民在万隆会议上宣布的公正原则。
    谢皮洛夫说，我们同叙利亚国家领导人在互相谅解和恳切的气氛中就国际局势和中近东局势以及苏联和叙利亚关系等重要问题进行了会谈。我们相信这些会谈将有利于我们两国，有利于和平，并且将加强国际信任和实行事务合作的事业。
