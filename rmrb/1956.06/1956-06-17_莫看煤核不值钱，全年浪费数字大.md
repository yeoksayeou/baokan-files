    Don't Look Down on Coal Nuggets as Worthless, The Annual Waste is a Huge Number
    Editor:
    The Tanggu Yongli Alkali Plant hauls out about two hundred cartloads of coal ash every day, which contains a large amount of coal nuggets. The Water and Motor Workshop has the most coal nuggets in the coal ash. According to a sampling survey on March 29th, the average coal nugget content was 49.5%. This workshop pulls out more than 160,000 jin of coal ash net weight every day. Based on this ratio, the coal ash contains more than 80,000 jin of coal nuggets a day, more than 2.4 million jin of coal nuggets are lost in a month, and the annual waste figure is shocking.
    Why is there such waste? The factory director, the director of the Water and Motor Workshop, and the foreman all said that this is because the factory has a large production volume and old equipment. However, in previous years, the factory's production volume was not too large, so why was there such waste then? They explained that it was an operational problem. Now it's a technical problem again! Regardless of whether it is a technical problem or an operational problem, Yongli Alkali Plant should immediately conduct an in-depth inspection to find the root cause of the waste and eliminate the waste. You should know that although coal nuggets are worthless, they accumulate over time, and the figures are shocking when wasted year after year.

    莫看煤核不值钱，全年浪费数字大编辑同志：
    塘沽永利沽厂每天拉出去的二百多马车的煤灰中，含有大量的煤核。煤灰里含煤核最多的是水汽车间，据三月二十九日抽查，平均含煤核量为49.5％。这个车间每天拉出的煤灰净重十六万多斤，按这个比例计算，一天的煤灰里就有煤核八万多斤，一个月就丢掉了煤核二百四十多万斤，一年浪费的数字就很惊人了。
    为什么会有这种浪费现象呢？这个工厂的厂长、水汽车间主任和工段长都说，这是因为厂子里的生产量大，设备老。但是，前几年这个厂的生产量并不算太大，为什么也有这种浪费现象呢？他们又解释说是操作问题。现在又是技术问题！不管是技术问题，还是操作问题，永利沽厂应该立即进行深入检查，找出造成浪费的根本原因，杜绝浪费现象。要知道，煤核虽然不值钱，但是积少成多，成年累月地浪费下去，数字也是很惊人的。
