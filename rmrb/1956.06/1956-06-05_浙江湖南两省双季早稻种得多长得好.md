    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 3rd: Zhejiang Province's double-season early rice planting area has increased by more than three million mu compared to last year. As of the end of May, the province had transplanted 10.5 million mu of double-season early rice seedlings, nearing completion of the original plan to expand double-season rice cultivation. Ningbo Prefecture, originally a double-season rice area, exceeded its expansion target for this year. Jiaxing Prefecture, originally a single-season late japonica rice area, has planted ten times more double-season early rice this year than last year.
    Currently, double-season early rice in various regions has generally survived and turned green, growing well. The first weeding has been completed in many areas, and the second weeding and fertilization are underway. Most agricultural cooperatives in Jiaxing Prefecture are also implementing a system of "eight fixes" (fixed time, fixed field, fixed person, fixed scope, fixed work points, fixed quality, fixed rewards and punishments) and responsibility management by section and household to strengthen field management of rice.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 3rd: Farmers in Hunan Province are strengthening field management, resulting in generally good growth of early and mid-season rice. Most early rice is now about one chi tall and beginning to fill the ridges; the mid-season rice, recently transplanted, is also growing with strong stalks and lush leaves, a verdant green.
    The total planting area of early and mid-season rice in Hunan Province this year is over 40 million mu. Of the more than 14 million mu of early rice, double-season early rice accounts for over 90%, more than double last year's amount. In the Dongting Lake plain and Xiang River basin, the main double-season rice producing areas, in addition to applying more than twice as much base fertilizer as in previous years to the double-season early rice fields, agricultural cooperatives have generally carried out one round of middle tillage and weeding since transplanting, and applied one to two applications of "an dun hui" (a type of quick-acting soil fertilizer applied near the rice seedlings). In the southern mountainous areas of Chen County and Yongxing County, where there has never been a tradition of topdressing, many farmers have joined agricultural cooperatives and are learning to apply "an dun hui" for the first time. Therefore, early rice in various regions is generally developing quickly and tillering abundantly. According to inspections of 311 cooperatives in Chaling and You County, nearly 80% of the 150,000 mu of early rice have more than 30 to 40 tillers per plant.
    Due to recent heavy rainfall, some areas in the Dongting Lake plain and southern mountainous areas that had experienced waterlogging and mountain floods were largely spared from disaster due to the efforts of agricultural producers' cooperatives and farmers to drain water and rescue crops; seedlings were replanted in areas where they were missing.
    Currently, farmers in various regions are paying attention to preventing and controlling insect pests in early and mid-season rice fields, continuing to strengthen field management, and striving for a bumper harvest.

### 浙江湖南两省双季早稻种得多长得好

    浙江湖南两省双季早稻种得多长得好
    据新华社杭州3日电　浙江省今年栽种的双季早稻面积，比去年增加三百多万亩。到五月底统计，全省已经插下双季早稻秧苗一千零五十万亩，接近完成原定扩种双季稻的计划。原来是双季稻区的宁波专区，超额完成了今年的扩种指标。原来是单季晚粳稻的嘉兴专区，今年栽种的双季早稻比去年增加了十倍。
    现在各地双季早稻已经普遍成活转青，生长良好。很多地区第一遍耘田已经结束，正在开始第二遍耘田和施肥。嘉兴专区大部分农业社还实行定时、定田、定人、定范围、定工分、定质量、定奖惩和分片、分户责任管理制，来加强水稻的田间管理工作。
    新华社长沙3日电　湖南省农民加强田间管理，使早、中稻普遍生长良好。现在早稻大多长到一尺来高，开始满垅封行；栽插不久的中稻也都长得株壮叶肥，一片青绿。
    湖南省今年早、中稻种植面积共四千多万亩。在一千四百多万亩早稻中，双季早稻占90％以上，比去年增加一倍多。在双季稻主要产区的洞庭湖滨平原和湘江流域，各农业社除在双季早稻田里施下了比往年多一倍以上的基肥外，插秧后到现在已经普遍进行了一次中耕除草，追施了一次到两次安蔸灰（一种施放在禾蔸旁的速效土肥）。从来没有追肥习惯的南部山区郴县、永兴等六县，今年许多农民加入农业社以后也第一次学习追施了安蔸灰。因此，各地早稻大多发蔸快、分蘖多。据茶陵、攸县两县的三百一十一个社检查，十五万亩早稻中，每蔸分蘖三十到四十根以上的占近80％。
    由于最近雨水多，洞庭湖滨平原和南部山区部分地区曾发生渍水和山洪的地方，经过农业生产合作社和农民大力排渍和抢救，绝大部分稻田没有成灾，缺苗处都补插了嫩绿的新秧。
    现在各地农民正在注意防治早、中稻田的虫害，继续加强田间管理，争取丰收。
