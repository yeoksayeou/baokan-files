Asian-African Students Demand Friendly Cooperation

In the past ten days or so, international public opinion, particularly in Asian and African countries, has universally expressed concern about the Asian-African Students Conference held in Bandung. After many difficulties and setbacks, this conference, with the attention and support of students from Asian and African countries and around the world, and relying on the joint efforts of the vast majority of national delegations, overcame various obstacles and difficulties and achieved complete success. This is a victory for the broad masses of Asian and African students, and also a victory for the international forces demanding peace and friendship, and for the spirit of consultation.

The Asian-African Students Conference communiqué and resolutions forcefully condemned colonialism and racial discrimination, supported the struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa to win national independence and freedom, called for efforts to ease international tensions, and called on students from Asian and African countries to conduct close cooperation in education and student activities based on mutual understanding and mutual respect. These all correctly expressed the common thoughts and demands of the broad masses of Asian and African students, and fully conformed to the common aspirations of the peoples of Asian and African countries, represented by the "Bandung spirit," to ensure world peace, strive for and safeguard national independence, and promote friendly cooperation between countries. Therefore, the communiqué and resolutions of the Asian-African Students Conference will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed and supported by the people and students in the Asian and African regions.

As pointed out by the representatives of the vast majority of countries at the Asian-African Students Conference, colonialism is the main root cause of the failure of cultural and educational development in many countries. Colonialism not only harms the national culture and education of these countries, causing their economies and cultures to fall into a state of depression and backwardness, but also hinders cultural exchanges and contacts between countries. Historical facts prove that national culture and education cannot be developed without eliminating the oppression of colonialism. National independence – this is a prerequisite for the development of culture and education. However, today, on large tracts of land in Asia and Africa, the crimes of racism continue. The rights to self-determination and basic human rights of many nations are denied, and the disasters of poverty and backwardness caused by colonial rule have only increased. Eliminating the shackles of colonialism and striving for and safeguarding national independence remain serious struggles facing the people of vast areas of Asia and Africa today. The Chinese people fully agree with the proposition put forward in the Asian-African Students Conference communiqué: the colonial war in Algeria and the colonial rule in Kenya and other colonies must end, West Irian must be returned to its motherland – Indonesia, the rights of the Arab people of Palestine must be respected, and the apartheid policies of South Africa must be abolished.

The Asian-African Students Conference's resolution on easing international tensions expressed the earnest demands of Asian and African students to safeguard world peace. The people and younger generation of Asia and Africa have suffered severely from war. Countless cities, villages, schools, and research institutes have been reduced to ashes in the flames of war. It is only natural that students hope for a peaceful world and believe that it is their responsibility to society to do their best to strive for the realization of this peaceful world. Today, in Asia and Africa and around the world, who is organizing aggressive military blocs and infringing on the territorial sovereignty of independent countries; who is trying to maintain and expand colonial rule; who is constantly testing nuclear weapons, thereby creating and intensifying international tensions; this is clearly visible in the minds of the Asian and African people. The people of Asia and Africa have always loved peace, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to try to use the Asian and African region as a place for the "Cold War." The Asian-African Students Conference's proposal on easing international tensions will surely receive the sincere sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world.

The Asian-African Conference, held last April with the participation of the governments of twenty-nine countries, called for strengthening cultural exchanges and cooperation between countries. This proposition was embodied in the resolutions of the Asian-African Students Conference. The Asian-African Students Conference put forward various positive suggestions and methods for strengthening student cooperation. It should be pointed out that cultural exchanges and cooperation between Asian and African countries have had a brilliant record in history, which was only destroyed in recent centuries due to the invasion and obstruction of colonialists. Asian and African students, who share the common aspirations of opposing colonialism, demanding national independence, opposing war, and demanding peace, naturally demand to strengthen mutual understanding and friendship in order to cooperate in a friendly manner in the common struggle. The strengthening of this friendly cooperation among students from Asian and African countries will help promote friendship between the people of all countries.

The Asian-African Students Conference is the first gathering of students in the history of this region. It is impossible for students from countries with different social systems and different ideologies to discuss so many issues without different views and opinions. But the question is not whether their views and opinions are consistent, but whether they have a sincere desire for friendly cooperation. The enemies of international peace and friendly cooperation have never relaxed any opportunity to undermine the friendly cooperation of the Asian and African people, and they do not even let go of a student gathering. The creators of international tensions and the maintainers of colonialism have tried their best to use various methods to create and expand divisions among the participants in the conference, in an attempt to poison the atmosphere of the conference in order to ultimately completely destroy the conference. Under the influence and instigation of this force, one can see that the words and deeds of individual representatives in the conference show that they are not conducive to the cause of friendly cooperation among Asian and African students. We believe that as the friendly relations between the peoples of Asian and African countries increase day by day, such people will decrease day by day, and the number of people demanding friendly cooperation will increase day by day. But despite these unpleasant things, the Asian-African Students Conference ultimately overcame various difficulties and reached a common language on many major issues. This once again proves that all differences, even with the negative effects caused by external factors, can be resolved as long as there is a sincere desire for friendly cooperation and the spirit of consultation that seeks common ground while reserving differences is fully utilized.

The Chinese people welcome the complete success of the Asian-African Students Conference and congratulate the Asian-African Students Conference on the strengthening of friendly cooperation among students from various countries. Chinese students must work together with students from Asian and African countries to strive for the implementation of the resolutions of the Asian-African Students Conference.

### 亚非学生要求友好合作

    亚非学生要求友好合作
    最近十几天来，国际舆论界特别是亚非各国的舆论界都普遍地表现了对于在万隆举行的亚非学生会议的关切。这个会议经过了不少困难和挫折，终于在亚非各国和全世界学生的关注和支持下，依靠绝大多数国家的代表团的共同努力，克服了种种阻挠和困难，获得了圆满的成就。这是亚非广大学生的一个胜利，也是国际要求和平友好力量和协商精神的胜利。
    亚非学生会议公报和各项决议有力地谴责了殖民主义和种族歧视，支持亚非两洲人民争取民族独立和自由的斗争；要求争取缓和国际紧张局势；号召亚非各国学生在相互谅解和相互尊重的基础上，在教育和学生活动各方面进行密切的合作。这些都正确地表达了亚非广大学生的共同思想和要求，完全符合以“万隆精神”为代表的亚非各国人民保障世界和平、争取和维护民族独立和促进各国友好合作的共同愿望。因此，亚非学生会议的公报和各项决议，无疑地将得到亚非地区人民和学生的热烈欢迎和支持。
    正如亚非学生会议上绝大多数国家代表发言中所指出的，殖民主义是造成许多国家文化教育不能得到正常发展的主要根源。殖民主义不但戕害这些国家的民族文化和教育，使他们的经济文化陷于萎靡和落后的状态，而且阻碍了各国之间的文化交流和接触。历史的事实证明：不消除殖民主义的压迫，民族文化和教育就不可能得到发展。民族独立——这是文化和教育发展的先决条件。但是，今天在亚非地区大片土地上，种族主义的罪行仍在继续。许多民族的自决权利和基本人权被否认，殖民统治所造成的贫穷和落后的灾难有加无已。消除殖民主义的桎梏，争取和维护民族独立仍然是今天亚非广大地区人民面临的严重斗争。中国人民完全同意亚非学生会议公报提出的主张：在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争和怯尼亚以及其他殖民地的殖民统治必须结束，西伊里安必须归还它的祖国——印度尼西亚，巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人民的权利必须得到尊重，南非的种族歧视政策必须废除。
    亚非学生会议对于要求缓和国际紧张局势的决议表达了亚非各国学生维护世界和平的殷切要求。亚非人民和青年一代，曾经受到战争的严重损害。无数的城市、乡村、学校、研究所，在炮火下化为灰烬。学生们希望有一个和平的世界，并且认为尽自己的最大努力来为实现这个和平的世界而奋斗，是自己对社会的责任，这是十分自然的。今天在亚非地区以及世界各地，谁在组织侵略性的军事集团，侵犯独立国家的领土主权；谁在竭力保持和扩大殖民主义统治；谁在不断地试验核子武器，借此制造和加剧国际紧张局势；这在亚非人民的心目中是看得清清楚楚的。亚非人民一向爱好和平，有人企图把亚非地区当做“冷战”的场所，在今天已经是越来越困难了。亚非学生会议关于和缓国际局势的主张，一定会得到全世界爱好和平人民的衷心同情和支持。
    去年四月举行的有二十九个国家政府参加的亚非会议，曾呼吁各国间加强彼此的文化交流和合作。这个主张在亚非学生会议的决议中得到了体现。亚非学生会议对于加强学生合作问题提出了各种积极的建议和办法。应该指出，亚非各国之间的文化交流和合作，在历史上曾有过辉煌的纪录，只是在最近的几个世纪才由于殖民主义者的侵入和阻挠而破坏。有着反对殖民主义、要求民族独立、反对战争和要求和平的共同愿望的亚非各国学生，自然要求加强彼此的了解和友谊，以便在共同斗争中友好合作。亚非各国学生这种友好合作的加强，将有助于促进各国人民间的友谊。
    亚非学生会议是这个地区学生历史上第一次的聚会。来自不同社会制度、不同思想意识的国家的学生在一起，讨论这许多问题而没有不同的看法和意见是不可能的。但问题不在于他们的看法和意见是否一致，问题主要是在于彼此之间是否具有友好合作的真诚愿望。国际和平和友好合作的敌人片刻都没有放松任何可以破坏亚非人民友好合作的机会，即使是一次学生的集会，他们也不予放过。国际紧张局势的制造者、殖民主义的维护人，竭力施展各种办法，在会议的参加者中间制造和扩大分歧，企图毒化会议的气氛，以达到最终完全破坏会议的目的。在这种势力的影响和指使下，人们看到有个别代表在会议中的言行表现了无助于亚非学生的友好合作事业。我们相信，随着亚非国家人民友好关系的日益增进，这样的人将一天比一天减少，而要求友好合作的人会一天一天增多。但是尽管有这些不愉快的事，亚非学生会议终究克服了种种困难，在许多主要的问题上得到了共同的语言。这就再一次地证明：一切分歧，即使还加上外来的因素所引起的消极作用，只要本着友好合作的真诚愿望，充分发挥求同存异的协商精神，都是可以解决的。
    中国人民欢迎亚非学生会议的圆满成功，对亚非学生会议获致的各国学生友好合作的加强表示庆贺。中国的学生一定要和亚非各国学生一起，共同为实现亚非学生会议的决议而努力。
