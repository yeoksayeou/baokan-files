    Curb the Spread of Swine Disease

    Recently, swine disease has been prevalent in many areas, resulting in the death of a large number of pigs. According to statistics from seven counties in Guangdong Province, including Zhongshan and Xinhui, since January of this year, 10,219 pigs have died from infectious diseases such as swine erysipelas and hog cholera. Among them, Xinhui County alone saw the death of over 1,500 pigs from the end of January to the end of March. In the Songjiang Special District of Jiangsu Province, over 16,000 pigs have died due to the prevalence of swine disease since February. The reason for the swine disease epidemic is the poor feeding management in agricultural production cooperatives and the lack of prevention and treatment knowledge and experience among the breeders. The indiscriminate slaughter of diseased pigs by food companies in some areas has also fueled the spread of swine disease.

    Currently, various regions are mobilizing agricultural production cooperatives to raise a large number of pigs. In order to prevent the spread of swine disease, all localities must earnestly guide agricultural cooperatives to improve their feeding management of pigs and strengthen the technical training and guidance for breeders. In areas where swine disease is prevalent, measures to eradicate the disease should be taken promptly. Commercial departments must strictly prohibit food companies from the practice of indiscriminately slaughtering diseased pigs.

    制止猪病流行
    近来不少地区猪病流行，大批猪只死亡。据广东省中山、新会等七个县的统计，从今年一月以来，因染猪丹毒、猪瘟等传染病而死亡的猪达10，219头，其中新会县从一月底至三月下旬，死亡的就有1，500多头。江苏省松江专区从二月份以来，因猪病流行而死亡的猪达16，000多头。猪病流行的原因是各地农业生产合作社饲养管理不善，饲养人员缺乏防治知识和经验。有些地区的食品公司滥宰病猪，也助长了猪病的流行。
    目前各地正在发动农业生产合作社大量养猪，为了防止猪病流行，各地必须认真领导农业合作社改善对猪的饲养管理，加强对饲养人员的技术传授和指导；在猪病正在流行的地区，更应及时采取扑灭猪病的措施。商业部门对于食品公司滥宰病猪的做法必须严格制止。
