Hubei Province's Fishery Production
　　Zhang Wei
　　Along the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei Province, there are more than 1,500 lakes, ponds, reservoirs, etc., covering an area of approximately 20 million mu. This area is rich in silver carp, black carp, crucian carp, whitebait, bighead carp, and bream. The fresh fish, dried fish, and fish fry from this area are sold throughout the country. This year, seventeen provinces and cities, including Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Guizhou, Jiangsu, Taiyuan, and Beijing, have already purchased approximately 1.6 billion fish fry from the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau.
　　Hubei Province has more than 59,000 fishermen and more than 456,000 semi-fishermen, owning more than 100,000 fishing boats. Before liberation, the lakes were occupied by landlords, and fishermen had to pay various rents such as "lake tax silver," "water crossing fees," and "fish leaving water money" to the lake despots to work in the lakes. The fish painstakingly caught by the fishermen were also subjected to high-interest exploitation by fish merchants and sold at low prices. Therefore, the lives of the fishermen were very impoverished. After liberation, the feudal exploitation system was abolished, and the ownership of the lakes was returned to the state, with the water surface being made available to the people. The government led the fishermen to organize. As of March this year, the province already had 414 fishery production cooperatives, with more than 21,500 fishermen households joining. Among them, there are 161 advanced cooperatives, with 13,699 fishermen households joining. The annual output has increased from more than 70,000 tons of fish in 1950 to more than 112,000 tons in 1955. This year, it is estimated that more than 150,000 tons of fish can be produced.
　　Releasing and raising adult fish and protecting juvenile fish and spawning female fish are important conditions for increasing fish production. In the past, fishermen went to the lakes to fish at their convenience and were unwilling to implement artificial stocking and protection of female and juvenile fish. The fish yield per mu was only about ten jin, and the yield gradually decreased. Now, after the fishermen organized by the local state-owned aquaculture farms have released and raised adult fish, and after strengthening technical guidance, the average fish yield per mu in 1955 increased to 48 jin, and some reached 700 to 800 jin.
　　In the first five-year plan of the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau, the province's fish production will increase from 93,000 tons in 1952 to 195,000 tons in 1957, and fish fry production will increase from 1.76 billion to 6 billion. In areas with many fishermen, more fishermen's villages will continue to be established to settle the fishermen's lives. In places where fish are raised, they also plan to plant trees and aquatic plants, green the lake areas, and build roads and dikes. Under the leadership of the aquatic products departments in various places, the fishermen are enthusiastically working to "develop the lake area and green the lake area."

    湖北省的渔业生产
    张碨
    在湖北省沿长江、汉水两岸，有一千五百多个湖泊、塘堰、水库等，面积达二千万亩左右。这里，盛产着鲢鱼、青鱼、鲫鱼、银鱼、胖头鱼和鳊鱼等。这里的鲜鱼、干鱼和鱼苗行销全国各地，今年已经有内蒙古、吉林、贵州、江苏、太原、北京等十七个省市向湖北省水产局购买鱼苗约十六亿尾。
    湖北省有五万九千多个渔民，有四十五万六千多个半渔民，拥有十万多只渔船。在解放前，湖泊被湖主霸占，渔民入湖作业，得向湖霸交纳“湖稞银子”、“过水票”、“鱼儿出水钱”等各种租钱。渔民辛勤捕捞的鱼，又受着鱼行的高利剥削，贱价出售。因此，渔民的生活很贫困。解放后，封建剥削制度废除了，湖泊权收归国有，水面交给人民使用。政府领导渔民组织起来，到今年三月为止，全省已经有渔业生产合作社四百一十四个，入社渔民有二万一千五百多户。其中高级社一百六十一个，入社渔民一万三千六百九十九户。年产量由1950年产鱼七万多吨增至1955年的十一万二千多吨。今年预计可产鱼十五万吨以上。
    放养成鱼和保护幼鱼及产卵的母鱼是增加鱼产量的重要条件。过去，渔民们随自己的方便下湖打鱼，不愿意实行人工放养和保护母鱼、幼鱼，每亩的鱼产量不过十来斤，产量还逐渐减少。现在，经过各地国营养殖场领导组织起来的渔民放养成鱼，加强技术指导后，1955年每亩的鱼产量平均提高到四十八斤，有的达到七、八百斤。
    在湖北省水产局的第一个五年计划里，1957年全省的鱼产量将由1952年的九万三千吨提高到十九万五千吨，鱼苗生产将由十七亿六千万尾提高到六十亿尾。在渔民多的地方，将继续建立起更多的渔民乡，使渔民生活定居。在养鱼的地方，他们还计划都栽上树木和水生植物，绿化湖区，修好道路和堤圩。渔民们在各地水产部门的领导下，正在为“开辟湖区、绿化湖区”而热情地劳动。
