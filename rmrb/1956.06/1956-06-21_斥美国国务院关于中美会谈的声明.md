    Refuting the U.S. State Department's Statement on Sino-American Talks

    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country issued a statement on June 12, 1956, regarding the situation of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks. The statement listed the draft joint statements recently proposed by both China and the United States during the talks. It is clear from these drafts that the Chinese side advocates that the talks should lead to the peaceful resolution of disputes between China and the United States, especially to seek and determine practical and feasible ways to ease and eliminate the tension in the Taiwan area; while the United States demands that China recognize the status quo of the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and interference in China's internal affairs, and refuses to conduct serious negotiations on the peaceful resolution of disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area.

    The U.S. State Department also issued a statement on June 12, 1956, regarding the Sino-American talks. The statement said that the U.S. draft proposed on April 19, 1956, and the Chinese draft previously proposed on December 1, 1955, were "exactly the same," with only two minor revisions, as if the United States had accepted the draft proposed by the Chinese side, and China had not accepted the U.S. revisions, and proposed a new draft on May 11, 1956, which was "in effect, rejecting its own proposal."

    Indeed, the U.S. draft of April 19 only made two revisions to the Chinese draft of December 1 last year. However, it is precisely these two revisions that changed the nature of the entire draft, and it is precisely these two revisions that demonstrate that the U.S. attempt to freeze the status quo in the Taiwan area and refuse to conduct serious negotiations, which it has consistently adhered to throughout the talks, has not changed in the slightest to this day.

    The first revision proposed by the U.S. side in its April 19 draft was to add the phrase "without prejudice to the inherent right of each party to pursue its policies by peaceful means, and without prejudice to the inherent right of each party to individual or collective self-defense" to the preamble of the joint statement. The U.S. policy towards China is to invade and occupy Taiwan and interfere in China's internal affairs. The illegal U.S.-Chiang treaty was signed under the pretext of the so-called right to individual or collective self-defense. The purpose of the U.S. proposal of this revision is clearly to have China recognize that the United States can continue to implement its policies of aggression and interference in China's territory of Taiwan and any area where the United States wants to interfere; to have China recognize that the United States can use the illegal U.S.-Chiang treaty to further carry out aggression and interference against China. The claim of self-defense against China on Chinese territory is absurd in itself. The right of self-defense must never be used to justify policies of aggression and interference. The Chinese side proposed the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs in its May 11 draft, which is reasonable and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The United States has no reason to object.

    The second revision by the U.S. side was to add the words "in the Taiwan area or elsewhere" to the sentence "The United States of America and the People's Republic of China express their determination that they should resolve disputes between the two countries through peaceful negotiations without resorting to threats or force," so that the final part of this sentence becomes "not to resort to threats or force in the Taiwan area or elsewhere." This wording itself contains the implication of confusing the international disputes between China and the United States with China's internal affairs. Moreover, while the United States specifically mentions the dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan area, it does not make any specific provisions for the meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States to find practical and feasible ways to resolve this dispute. The intention of the U.S. side in doing so is clearly to have China recognize the status quo of the U.S. armed rule of Taiwan and interference in China's liberation of the coastal islands, and then indefinitely delay the Sino-American talks, not hold a foreign ministers' meeting, and not conduct serious negotiations on the dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan area. The Chinese side has long stated that either a general statement should be issued by China and the United States on the peaceful resolution of disputes without the use of force, which is the draft proposed by the Chinese side on December 1 last year; or if the Taiwan area is to be specifically mentioned in the joint statement, specific provisions must be made for holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States. In its May 11 draft, the Chinese side took into account the U.S. requirements and specifically applied the general principle of peaceful resolution of disputes between China and the United States without the use of force to the Taiwan area. This draft stipulates that practical and feasible ways to peacefully resolve disputes, including holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States, should be sought and determined within two months after the issuance of the statement. This is also taking into account the U.S. views in order to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties. This draft clearly demonstrates the continuous efforts made by the Chinese side to reach an agreement. Any attempt to say that this draft is "not a bit of progress" is completely futile.

    The U.S. State Department's statement also mentioned the agreement on the repatriation of civilians between the Sino-American ambassadorial talks. It should be pointed out that this agreement has never been an agreement to immediately release all civilians of the other party who have violated the law in their own country, and China has never undertaken this international obligation. Nevertheless, the Chinese side has taken appropriate measures against Americans who have violated the law in China in accordance with its own legal procedures, and has enabled the vast majority of them to exercise their right to return home, which the U.S. government cannot deny. However, the United States is still obstructing a large number of Chinese people from returning to their country, and the measures taken by the U.S. government, such as the "Taiwan entry permit," to obstruct Chinese students from returning to their country have not yet been cancelled. People have every reason to demand that the United States faithfully fulfill the agreement and revoke all measures that obstruct Chinese people from returning to their country.

### 斥美国国务院关于中美会谈的声明

    斥美国国务院关于中美会谈的声明
    我国外交部在1956年6月12日就中美大使级会谈的情况发表了声明，声明中列举了中美双方最近在会谈中所各自提出的共同声明的草案。从这些草案中可以清楚地看出，中国方面主张会谈应该导致中美两国之间的争端的和平解决，特别是为和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势寻求和确定切实可行的途径；而美国方面却要求中国承认美国霸占台湾和干涉中国内政的现状，拒绝对和平解决中美两国之间在台湾地区的争端进行认真的谈判。 
    美国国务院在1956年6月12日也发表了一个关于中美会谈的声明。声明说，美国在1956年4月19日提出的草案和中国前次在1955年12月1日提出的草案是“完全相同的”，只是作了两点小小的修正，仿佛美国已经接受了中国方面所建议的草案，而中国没有接受美国的修正，在1956年5月11
  日另行提出了新的草案，就是“在实际上拒绝了自己的建议”。
    的确，美国四月十九日的草案对中国在去年十二月一日提出的草案，只是作了两点修正。但是，正是这两点修正使整个草案改变了性质，正是这两点修正说明了美国在会谈中自始至终所一直坚持的冻结台湾地区的现状，和拒绝认真进行谈判的企图，至今丝毫没有改变。
    美方在四月十九日草案中所提出的第一点修正是要在双方共同声明的序言中增加“在不损害各方用和平方法执行自己的政策，也不损害各方的单独或集体自卫的固有权利的情况下”的短句。美国对中国的政策就是要侵占台湾和干涉中国内政。美蒋非法条约就是在所谓单独或集体自卫权利的借口下签定的。美国提出这一修正的目的显然是要中国承认，美国在中国的领土台湾和任何美国要进行干涉的地区都可以继续执行侵略和干涉的政策；要中国承认，美国可以利用非法的美蒋条约进一步对中国进行侵略和干涉。在中国的领土上对中国进行自卫的说法，本身就是荒谬的。自卫的权利决不容许被用来为侵略和干涉的政策作辩护。中国方面在五月十一日的草案中提出互相尊重领土完整和不干涉内政的原则，这才是合理的，符合于联合国宪章的原则的。美国没有任何理由反对。
    美方的第二点修正是在“美利坚合众国和中华人民共和国表示决心，它们应该通过和平谈判解决它们两国之间的争端，而不诉诸威胁或武力”的一句中增添“在台湾地区或其他地方”的字样，使这一句中的最后部分变为“不在台湾地区或其他地方诉诸威胁或武力”。这种措辞本身就包藏着混淆中美之间的国际争端和中国内政问题的含意。而且，美国一方面具体提出中美两国在台湾地区的争端，另一方面，对于解决这一争端的切实可行的途径的中美外长会议，却又不作任何具体的规定。美方这样做的用意显然是要中国承认美国武装统治台湾和干涉中国解放沿海岛屿的现状，然后无限期地拖延中美会谈，不开外长会议，不对中美两国之间在台湾地区的争端进行认真的谈判。中国方面早已声明，要么就发表一个中美双方和平解决争端而不使用武力的一般声明，这就是中国方面去年十二月一日提出的草案；如果要在共同声明中具体提到台湾地区，就必须具体规定举行中美外长会议。中国方面在五月十一日的草案中，照顾了美方的要求，把和平解决中美两国之间的争端而不使用武力的一般原则具体应用于台湾地区。这一草案中规定，发表声明后的两个月内寻求和确定和平解决争端的切实可行的途径，包括举行中美外长会议在内。这同样地是照顾了美方的意见，以便达成双方都能够接受的协议。这一草案清楚地说明了中国方面为达成协议而作的不断努力。任何把这一草案说成是“没有丝毫的前进”的企图，是完全徒劳的。
    美国国务院的声明中还提到中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题的协议。应该指出，这个协议从来就不是立即释放所有对方在本国境内犯法的平民的协议，中国也从来没有承担过这项国际义务。虽然如此，中国方面还是根据自己的法律程序，对于在中国犯法的美国人采取了适当措施，而且已经使他们当中的绝大部分行使了回国权利，这是美国政府也不能否认的。但是，美国却至今仍然阻挠大批中国人回国，美国政府所采取的“台湾入境证”等阻挠中国学生回国的措施至今没有取消。人们有完全的理由要求美国忠实履行协议，撤销一切阻挠中国人回国的措施。
