    The children of Beijing watched two new children's plays, "Summer is Coming" and "How the Little Fly Became an Elephant," and the famous fairy tale play "Malan Flower" on "June 1st" Children's Day. These plays are gifts from China's first children's theater, the China Children's Theater, which was newly established on this day, to the children.
    This newly built children's theater will specialize in staging fairy tale plays and dramas suitable for children's psychology, and develop children's drama art. At present, in addition to rehearsing plays for public performance, the actors are also rushing to rehearse a fairy tale play "Clever Daughter-in-law" adapted from a mythological story, and the famous Soviet children's play "Mashenka".

    第一座儿童剧院成立
    北京的儿童“六一”观赏了两个新的儿童剧“夏天来了”、“小苍蝇是怎样变成大象的”和著名童话剧“马兰花”。这几个戏是这天新成立的中国第一座儿童剧院——中国儿童剧院献给孩子们的礼物。
    这个新建的儿童剧院将专门上演适合儿童心理的童话剧和话剧，发展儿童戏剧艺术。现在，演员们除了排出公演的剧目外，还在赶排一个根据神话故事改编的童话剧“巧媳妇”和苏联著名的儿童剧“马申卡”。
