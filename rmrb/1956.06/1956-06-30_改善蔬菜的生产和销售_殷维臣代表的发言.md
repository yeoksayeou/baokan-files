    Improving Vegetable Production and Sales
    -- Speech by Delegate Yin Weichen
    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 final accounts and the 1956 budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee.
    Our Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, started in 1952 with only 8 households. Through several years of development, it has now merged with four other cooperatives, including Baipenyao, to become an advanced cooperative with 2,117 households. Due to being organized and leveraging the advantages of collective production, production has increased year after year, and the income of cooperative members has increased annually. Currently, in addition to managing agricultural production such as vegetables and grains, our cooperative also engages in various sideline businesses such as pig farming, flour milling, flower cultivation, and transportation. It is estimated that this year's production will increase by more than 20% compared to 1955, and the average income of cooperative members will increase by about 30%.
    I would now like to raise two issues in our work, hoping that relevant departments will pay attention to resolving them.
    First, the issue of vegetable production and sales. Producing vegetables to meet the needs of urban residents is the glorious task of our suburban agricultural production cooperatives. In recent years, our vegetable production has increased rapidly, but it still cannot meet the needs of urban residents. A serious problem in vegetable production is that vegetables cannot be sold during the peak season. Sometimes, the money earned from selling vegetables at the market is not even enough to cover transportation costs, resulting in significant losses for the cooperative. Last year, 1.6 million jin of locally produced vegetables rotted in the market in this city (this is a very incomplete figure, not including those that rotted in the agricultural cooperatives and outside the market), and 3.7 million jin of cabbage transported from other places rotted. But are there enough vegetables for the workers, students, and cadres in the city to eat? There are still not enough, and many people still complain that the agricultural cooperatives are not growing enough vegetables. This problem has not been well resolved for several years. In the autumn of 1954, our cooperative planted more than 70 mu of Chinese cabbage and rapeseed, but later, more than 20 mu of vegetables had to be used to feed pigs because they could not be sold. This spring, we planted 162 mu of small vegetables (including Chinese cabbage, rapeseed, spinach, etc.). A few days ago, because they could not be sold, 12 mu of vegetables were left to rot and were thrown away (each mu yields 3,000 jin, totaling about 36,000 jin). The 30,000 jin of rapeseed brought to the market sold for only 3 li per jin, which was not enough to cover the cost (the cost per mu of small vegetables is more than 20 yuan, not including labor). Sometimes the vegetables at the vegetable stations also cannot be sold. Near the Guang'anmen vegetable station, there are two large pits more than one zhang deep, which are filled with rotten vegetables. The farmers call them "blood and sweat pits." Because of such great losses, the cooperative members complained to the government, saying, "The bumper harvest of vegetables is sent to the market to rot, it's a waste of effort"; "The government calls on us to grow more vegetables, but no one cares when we grow them"; "Someone cares when vegetable prices are high, but when there are vegetables available (that is, when a large amount of vegetables are ripe during the peak season), no one wants them, and no one cares." The reasons for the above situations include shortcomings in the agricultural cooperatives, such as poor production planning and variety arrangement, some cooperatives pursuing quantity while neglecting quality, and not grading and packaging in baskets; but the vegetable company has many problems in sales, such as their adoption of the "replace old with new" method of selling vegetables, which results in the new vegetables becoming old, and the old vegetables not being sold and rotting; some places have abolished and merged vegetable supply and marketing points, and people have to queue to buy vegetables; the vegetable joint sales team's vegetable carts leave late, not as early as the vegetable vendors used to; cooperative distribution points sell vegetables at the mechanically allocated price, regardless of whether the goods are good or bad, and do not change the price even if they are bad, etc., which all hinder the promotion of vegetable sales. In order to solve the problem of vegetable supply in the city, we suggest that relevant departments earnestly improve the production and sales of vegetables, and vegetables should be sold according to quality and price. We also suggest establishing a vegetable dehydration processing plant. After vegetables are processed and dehydrated, nutrients can still be preserved. Although the cost is higher, they can be supplied for consumption when there is a shortage of vegetables. In addition, I suggest that everyone make more pickles and dried vegetables, and never let vegetables rot and be thrown away for nothing.
    Second, the problem of frequent meetings and heavy burdens. I started with mutual aid teams in 1951, and the mutual aid teams were transformed into cooperatives in 1952. At that time, I could still directly participate in production. After I was selected as a labor model, things became more complicated, and I worked less. In 1954 and 1955, there were particularly many missed workdays. When I was in the cooperative, visitors, interviewers, and journalists all looked for me, and some agencies would only look for the director for any matter, big or small. If I didn't go, people would say, "He's too arrogant, complacent." If I had to entertain them, I couldn't take care of production, and I wouldn't know what was going on in the cooperative, nor could I solve problems. There were also many invitations from agencies, troops, and schools to give reports. During the high tide of cooperativization last year, I went out to speak 6 times in a row. Furthermore, there are many meetings outside, and the longer ones include district representative meetings, city representative meetings, cadre training classes, director training classes, district labor model meetings, and city labor model meetings. Last year, I spent a maximum of 5 months in the cooperative (the city has paid attention to this this year, and it is much better). Always going to meetings outside, away for three days and at home for three days, when I return to the cooperative, I can't fully engage in production; although I have learned a lot about national affairs, which is very beneficial and has improved my knowledge, I don't understand the situation in the cooperative. Some cooperative members and cooperative cadres said to me, "If there's something outside, you just run outside!" "You're taken care of, we can't count on you!" If this continues, it will affect the cooperative's production. If production is not done well, how can the income of cooperative members be increased? If this continues, the model is not a model, but becomes a "trouble." This is really a problem that needs to be solved. My opinion: unnecessary meetings should not notify labor models to participate, let labor models focus on production. Agencies, schools, and troops don't have to only look for the cooperative director, let the cooperative director concentrate on managing production.

    改善蔬菜的生产和销售
    ——殷维臣代表的发言
    我对李先念副总理关于1955年决算和1956年预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明和彭真副委员长的常务委员会工作报告完全同意。
    我们北京市丰台区黄土岗农业生产合作社从1952年开始办社，当时只有8户，经过几年来的发展，现在已经和白盆窑等四社合并成为2，117户的高级社了。由于组织起来，发挥了集体生产的优越性，生产连年提高，社员收入年年增加。现在我们合作社除经营蔬菜、粮食等农业生产外，还兼营着养猪、粉房、鲜花、运输等多种副业。预计今年生产量将比1955年增加20％以上，社员收入平均增加30％左右。
    我现在提出工作中的两个问题，希望有关部门注意解决。
    第一，关于蔬菜产销问题。生产蔬菜供应城市人民的需要，是我们郊区农业生产合作社的光荣任务。几年来，我们蔬菜产量增加得很快，但是还不能满足城市人民的需要。蔬菜生产的一个严重问题是到了旺季的时候菜卖不出去。有的菜拉到了市场，卖得的钱还不够车脚钱，使社里损失不小。本市生产的菜去年在市场烂掉160万斤（这是个很不完全的数字，烂在农业社和市场外的不算），外地运来的大白菜烂了370万斤。可是菜是不是够城市里工人、学生、干部们吃呢？还是不够吃，许多人还埋怨农业社菜种得少。这个问题几年都没有很好解决。1954年秋天，我们社里种了70多亩小白菜、油菜，后来有20多亩菜因为卖不掉，只好喂了猪。今年春天种了162亩小菜（包括小白菜、油菜、菠菜等），头些日子因为卖不掉烂了，扔了12亩地的菜 （每亩出3，000斤，共约36，000斤）。拉到市场的3万斤油菜，只卖到3厘多1斤，根本不够成本（每亩小菜不算人工，成本要20多元）。菜站的菜有时也卖不掉，广安门菜站附近有两个一丈多深的大坑，都填满了烂菜，农民们叫它“血汗坑”。因为受了这样大的损失，社员埋怨政府说：“丰收的菜送到市场烂掉了，真白费劲”；“政府号召我们多种菜，我们种了没人管了”；“菜价高了有人管，菜得了（就是旺季大量菜成熟了）没有人要，也没有人管了”。发生以上情况的原因，在农业社方面也是有缺点的，如生产计划和品种安排得不好，有的社追求数量忽视质量，没有分级装筐等；但蔬菜公司在销售方面问题很多，如他们采取“推陈储新”的卖菜法，结果新菜变陈了，陈菜卖不掉，烂掉了；有些地方将蔬菜供销点撤销合并，买菜得排队；蔬菜联营组菜车出车时间晚，不如以前菜贩早；合作社分销处机械按调拨价卖菜，好坏货一样，坏了也不变价等，这都妨碍了蔬菜的推销工作。为了解决城市蔬菜的供应问题，我们建议有关部门认真改善蔬菜的生产和销售工作，蔬菜应按质论价出售。并建议筹设蔬菜脱水加工厂。蔬菜经过加工脱水后，养分仍可保存。虽然成本高些，但却可以供给缺菜时食用。另外，我建议大家多制腌菜和干菜。决不让蔬菜白白烂掉扔掉。
    第二，开会多负担重的问题。我从1951年搞互助组，1952年互助组转了合作社，那时还能直接参加生产。我被选为劳动模范以后，事就多了起来，劳动少了。1954、1955两年误工特别多。我在社里的时候，参观的、访问的、新闻记者都找我，有的机关有点大小事也非找主任不行。如果不去吧，人家就说：“架子不小，骄傲自满”。要招待，就没法顾生产，社里有事就不知道，也不能解决。还有机关、部队、学校来请做报告的也不少，去年合作化高潮时，我一连出去讲了6次。再说到外面开会很多，会期比较长的就有区代表会、市代表会、干部训练班、主任训练班、区劳模会、市劳模会。去年我一年最多在社里呆了5个月（今年市里注意了，已经好得多了）。这样老是到外头开会，走三天在家三天，回到社里也不能全力搞生产；这对我本身虽然多了解到国家大事，有很大好处，提高了知识，可是我对社里的情况反倒不了解了。有些社员和社干部就说我：“外头有事，你就跑外吧！”“你是打了花销的了，不指着你了！”这样下去，影响到社里的生产，生产搞不好，怎么增加社员收入呢？这样下去，模范不是模范，成了“麻烦”。这实在是个要解决的问题。我的意见：不必要的会议，不要通知劳动模范去参加，让劳动模范好好搞生产，机关、学校、部队，这儿那儿找，不必尽找社主任，让社主任集中力量管生产。
