    I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives.

    The promulgation of the Model Regulations for Advanced Cooperatives will greatly delight the broad masses of peasant brothers because this charter provides detailed and clear regulations on production management, labor organization, the development of diversified economic production, and share funds. For example, in primary cooperatives, share funds were contributed based on land, or a combination of land and labor. However, after the establishment of advanced cooperatives, land is no longer distributed for dividends, so continuing to contribute share funds based on land as in the past presents many problems. The charter clearly stipulates that share funds should be allocated based on labor, which I believe is very reasonable and correct. Therefore, the formulation of this charter will provide a clearer goal and direction for the future development of cooperatives and further increase production. For me personally, having this charter makes my work and production brighter and bolder.

    Now, I will briefly report to the conference on our cooperative's implementation of diligent and thrifty cooperative management and the development of a diversified economy. Our cooperative also grew from small to large. Initially, there were only 3 households, but now there are 1,771 households with more than 8,300 people, managing more than 20,000 mu of land as an advanced cooperative. Over the past few years, under the correct leadership and support of the higher-level Party committee and government, production has continuously increased, the superiority of being organized has been brought into play, and the income of cooperative members has also increased significantly. However, we always felt tight financially, and the cooperative had difficulty covering some expenses and the members' daily small expenses. Sometimes, we had to borrow from the state.

    Since the central government put forward the idea of diligent and thrifty cooperative management and called on us to strengthen business management and develop diversified economic production, our cooperative has resolutely implemented it. Let me briefly explain: Regarding diligent and thrifty cooperative management, some people initially felt that with the arrival of the high tide of cooperation, money seemed to come with the tide. Some cooperative members developed a preference for the new and disliked the old, and were unwilling to use old-fashioned farm tools, wanting to show off and save face. Some cadres also had this idea, saying, "Our cooperative is so famous, we should at least build a large auditorium, otherwise it would be too unsightly." This is also an inevitable law. However, it must be understood that a family starts with diligence and thrift. As the old farmers say, "Eat and dress according to your family's assets." Just wanting to do well is not enough; you also have to see if the cooperative has money. Can you take it out? Borrowing from the state is not feasible, and asking cooperative members to invest is also limited. There is not enough investment in production, and the common people "do not leave money idle for half a year." Moreover, cooperative members are not well-off, so according to the research of the cooperative committee, our cooperative did not engage in any non-productive construction. Someone who visited our cooperative said to me: "Before I came, I thought that the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative was an old cooperative with great achievements, and I thought it must have been built very magnificently. But when I saw it, I felt cold. Six accountants, one custodian, and the credit cooperative all live in three rooms, plain and ordinary, only in name. But after actually seeing and hearing the introduction, I realized that you have truly implemented the central government's policy of diligent and thrifty cooperative management." Their views and ideas have also changed. Our cooperative also paid attention to tapping potential from all aspects and reducing the expenses of non-production personnel. For example, the investment of scrap iron by cooperative members alone (broken pots, old iron, and some unusable farm tools, etc.) amounted to more than 20,000 jin. Our cooperative has its own blacksmith furnace and used it to make small farm tools such as iron rakes, hoes, and spades, turning waste into finished products, which saved a lot of money.

    We also accumulated more than 80,000 cartloads of soil fertilizer and urine fertilizer (400 jin per cart), reducing the use of chemical fertilizers. Speaking of the cadres in the cooperative, we originally estimated that we would need more than 20 people, but now there are only 9 non-production cadres. Due to the strengthening of production management and the improvement of labor organization, the work has also become busier. In this way, not only has the production cost been reduced, but also the cooperative members have benefited, and everyone is very satisfied. I directly realized that the central government's policy of "diligent and thrifty cooperative management" is extremely correct and timely.

    In accordance with the central government's instructions, we have also developed a diversified economy in the sideline production, on the premise of not affecting agricultural production and increasing production. Our cooperative now has more than ten kinds of sideline businesses such as carpentry, blacksmith furnace, construction, transportation, flour mill, oil press, pig and chicken raising, vegetable garden, and lime and brick kilns. The average monthly net profit is six or seven thousand yuan, and the estimated annual income is seventy or eighty thousand yuan, which has solved some of the cooperative's expenses, reduced borrowing money from the state, and also increased the income of the cooperative members, solving the difficulty of the members' daily small expenses. According to my practical experience, as mentioned in the reports of Minister Liao and Vice Premier Deng Zihui, without developing a diversified economy and carrying out sideline production, it is difficult to increase the personal income of more than 90% of cooperative members, even if there is a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. This is indeed the case, because there is a limit to land and labor, and the output can only reach a certain level. From our experience, the benefits of sideline production are also numerous. For example, our cooperative made more than 400 well rims and repaired more than 400 carts and other various farm tools, all from the profits of sideline production. At the same time, the cooperative has carpenters and blacksmiths, and the commonly used farm tools and carts can be repaired at any time if they break, which saves money and does not delay production. They can also improve or create some small new farm tools according to the local actual situation, which is also good for agricultural technology reform. Especially after the establishment of advanced cooperatives, the implementation of remuneration according to labor greatly increased the enthusiasm of cooperative members for production, and there was some surplus labor. The development of handicraft production can properly arrange labor, and can also solve the difficulties of old, weak, disabled, widowed and lonely households without labor. Because land is not distributed for dividends in advanced cooperatives, and income is earned by earning work points through more labor, they have no way to earn a living, and relying solely on the cooperative's care is also passive. Our cooperative placed the elderly, disabled, and other people who could not do heavy work in the flour mill or other sideline production departments to do as much as they could. For example, a cooperative member named Ma Shao could not do heavy physical labor due to illness in his early years, so he peeled flour sheets, pasted flour sheets, and swept the courtyard in the flour mill. In addition, Wang Ting and Sun Anwu were both disabled and could not work downhill, so they were assigned to manage the lime kiln work according to their specialties (one could write and the other could burn lime), solving their production and living problems. The work points they earned were not as many as those of strong young people, but they accumulated over time. Therefore, from these specific things in our cooperative, we have further realized that agricultural production must be combined with sideline production, and the development of a diversified economy can achieve the goal of increasing the income of more than 90% or even 100% of cooperative members. In addition, we have also realized that this is also a concrete manifestation of the superiority of advanced cooperatives. Why? Self-employment goes without saying, and primary cooperatives cannot do it either, because you have money but no technical personnel, and you have technical personnel but may not have enough money. We encountered this point at the beginning. When the cooperative was small, we wanted to run a flour mill, but there was only one person who knew how to make flour, and there were difficulties in all aspects. Later, when the cooperative became larger, there were six or seven people who knew how, and the problem of funds and technical personnel was easily solved. Now, the cooperative members are happy to say: "Our cooperative has everything, blacksmiths, carpenters, oil presses, and flour mills. We don't ask for help from anyone. Even the landlords and rich peasants in the past only had an oil press or a wine shop at most," which makes the cooperative members see the happy prospects of socialism even more. They don't care about whether they have those two mu of land at all. So, does engaging in sideline businesses affect agricultural production? As long as the organization is good, it does not affect it. Our cooperative has more than 4,000 laborers, 240 fixed workers in sideline businesses, and about 200 temporary workers. Not only does their production exceed their agricultural labor income, but also because the cooperative members have a high enthusiasm for production after the advanced cooperative, the improvement of labor efficiency has far exceeded the number of workers used in sideline businesses.

    Finally, I have a few suggestions: (1) It is certain that we should develop a diversified economy of sideline businesses in agricultural production cooperatives. However, can we develop handicrafts? This question is still a question in the cooperatives. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives of the county and district believe that the transformation of handicrafts is their business, and that handicraftsmen in rural areas should all be concentrated in the handicraft cooperatives in the district. Their reason is that this is convenient for leadership and beneficial for development, and it is not suitable to put them in agricultural cooperatives. We have different views. Taking iron and wood industries as examples, they are closely related to our agricultural cooperatives. If they are concentrated in the district, it will be very inconvenient for the production of agricultural cooperatives. For example, our cooperative has 470 small carts. Because the production is busy and the cooperative members are very enthusiastic, the carts are used very frequently. Even if we pay attention to saving, we have to replace the axles and ears several times a year. Other farm tools are also often damaged. If there are carpenters in the cooperative, they can repair and replace them without spending cash. Usually, if there is a problem with the axle, foot, or other farm tools, it can be repaired immediately. If the carpenters are concentrated in the district, it will take a dozen or twenty miles to go back and forth, and the handicraft cooperative has its own plans, so it will take three or five days to get in line to repair a farm tool, and the production will be delayed. For example, one cooperative had a seeder with a small problem on the corner, and it took 25 miles to wait for 3 days to repair it. As the cooperative develops, the construction of pigsties, cowsheds, threshing floors, houses, and making doors and windows all require carpenters. If you ask others to do it, not only is it not timely and inconvenient, but the most headache is that you have to pay cash. If you don't have money, the handicraft cooperative cannot owe you money. If there are carpenters in the cooperative, the problem is solved. Now, the cooperative has a large number of new farm tools, double-wheeled double-plow plows, and waterwheels, etc. The farmers actually know how to use them, but the problem is that there is no way to fix them if there is a small problem. Sending them to the district for repair is as inconvenient as repairing the seeder. If there are blacksmiths in the cooperative, they can not only make small farm tools, but also repair new farm tools, which will play a significant role. Furthermore, iron and wood workers are unwilling to be concentrated in the district to join the handicraft cooperative. A carpenter in our cooperative said to me: "Please ask the government, if I join the advanced cooperative, am I considered transformed? If I am, I will not go to the district. If not, I will not be a carpenter." There is reason for this if you study it carefully, and you cannot casually put the hat of "backwardness" on them. Most of the carpenters in rural areas are half farmers and half workers. They are carpenters in the slack season and go to the ground to grow crops in the busy season. Adding the income from both aspects, they can make a living. If he is concentrated in the handicraft cooperative and earns 20 yuan a month, the money goes into his hand and the food goes into his mouth, and there is not much left. Although the women in the family have joined the cooperative, they have limited labor to take care of children and housework, and they do not earn many work points, so life is difficult, and there is a great danger of withdrawing from the cooperative. Some of our county and district cadres do not conduct in-depth investigations into the lives of the masses and the production requirements of the cooperatives. They blindly emphasize the implementation of the instructions of the higher authorities and hold a simple task view, so the masses are naturally dissatisfied. The handicraftsmen in our cooperative insist on not being concentrated, but we did not have a basis in the past. Although Article 27 of the current regulations stipulates the development of sideline production, including handicraft production, it is still suggested that the government should define the boundaries of sideline business, which belongs to the supply and marketing cooperative and which belongs to the agricultural cooperative, and the organization of handicraft cooperatives can be divided into regions and conditions. For example, in areas where agriculture is the main industry, it is better to put wood and iron workers in agricultural cooperatives. But it is also necessary to pay attention to the fact that the development of sideline businesses must also start from the conditions and should be carried out in a planned way according to the actual situation to prevent blind development. (2) Farmland water conservancy construction was originally a long-term plan, but the county and district cadres unilaterally pursued figures and did not proceed from reality. Taking well drilling as an example, the higher authorities repeatedly demanded figures, and the figures rose every two or three days. Later, it was about one well for every 15 mu of land, regardless of the height of the terrain, the direction of the water source, or whether it was needed or not. Anyway, 15 mu were combined into one well, some were drilled on the mountains, some were drilled by the river, and some could not produce water. After drilling 200 wells, there were no bricks, and many of them collapsed after a winter of frozen soil, so they had to be repaired. Some were filled in. There were so many wells, but there were very few water lifting tools. Some wells with water could not get water because there were no water lifting tools. This blind work regardless of location conditions caused a lot of waste of manpower and material resources, which is not in line with the policy of "diligent and thrifty cooperative management". All this is inseparable from the contracting and substitution of district and township cadres and cooperative cadres. If they listen more to the opinions of cooperative members and the cooperative committee, the problem will not be so serious. According to a representative at this conference, some resident cooperative cadres asked the cooperative to build a basketball court in each production team. Nine teams would have to spend thousands of yuan on nine sets of basketball stands and nine balls, and each team would also have a health care kit. Some resident cooperative cadres also complained that the cooperative management committee could not make big plans and asked "who can make big plans". He only knew that he was supplied by the state and received his salary on time, but he did not know that it was not easy for the common people to earn money. "If you are not in charge of a household, you don't know the price of firewood, rice, oil, and salt." He did not think that the cooperative members had so much money, and they did not have the leisure to play basketball. (3) There are also problems in the supply of farm tools by the supply and marketing cooperatives to the countryside. The supply does not meet the agricultural season or the needs of the masses. For example, some places reported: some double-wheeled double-plow plows were transported after the land was cultivated, and manure spreaders were transported after the sowing was done. The supply was very untimely. Furthermore, the supply and marketing cooperatives purchased meat products (cattle, pigs, etc.) in rural areas at very low prices, but sold them at high prices. As a result, the cooperative and the masses were unwilling to raise pigs and cattle, which also caused a shortage of meat supply in the cities. This problem should also be paid attention to and solved.

    That's all I have to say. There are also many shortcomings in the work of our cooperative. After returning this time, we will definitely work with the cooperative members to study the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives well, and under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee and government, run our cooperative better and strive to overfulfill this year's production tasks.
