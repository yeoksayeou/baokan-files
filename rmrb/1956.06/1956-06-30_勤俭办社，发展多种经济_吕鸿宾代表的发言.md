    I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives.

    The promulgation of the Model Regulations for Advanced Cooperatives will greatly delight the broad masses of peasant brothers because this charter provides detailed and clear regulations on production management, labor organization, the development of diversified economic production, and share funds. For example, in primary cooperatives, share funds were contributed based on land, or a combination of land and labor. However, after the establishment of advanced cooperatives, land is no longer distributed for dividends, so continuing to contribute share funds based on land as in the past presents many problems. The charter clearly stipulates that share funds should be allocated based on labor, which I believe is very reasonable and correct. Therefore, the formulation of this charter will provide a clearer goal and direction for the future development of cooperatives and further increase production. For me personally, having this charter makes my work and production brighter and bolder.

    Now, I will briefly report to the conference on our cooperative's implementation of diligent and thrifty cooperative management and the development of a diversified economy. Our cooperative also grew from small to large. Initially, there were only 3 households, but now there are 1,771 households with more than 8,300 people, managing more than 20,000 mu of land as an advanced cooperative. Over the past few years, under the correct leadership and support of the higher-level Party committee and government, production has continuously increased, the superiority of being organized has been brought into play, and the income of cooperative members has also increased significantly. However, we always felt tight financially, and the cooperative had difficulty covering some expenses and the members' daily small expenses. Sometimes, we had to borrow from the state.

    Since the central government put forward the idea of diligent and thrifty cooperative management and called on us to strengthen business management and develop diversified economic production, our cooperative has resolutely implemented it. Let me briefly explain: Regarding diligent and thrifty cooperative management, some people initially felt that with the arrival of the high tide of cooperation, money seemed to come with the tide. Some cooperative members developed a preference for the new and disliked the old, and were unwilling to use old-fashioned farm tools, wanting to show off and save face. Some cadres also had this idea, saying, "Our cooperative is so famous, we should at least build a large auditorium, otherwise it would be too unsightly." This is also an inevitable law. However, it must be understood that a family starts with diligence and thrift. As the old farmers say, "Eat and dress according to your family's assets." Just wanting to do well is not enough; you also have to see if the cooperative has money. Can you take it out? Borrowing from the state is not feasible, and asking cooperative members to invest is also limited. There is not enough investment in production, and the common people "do not leave money idle for half a year." Moreover, cooperative members are not well-off, so according to the research of the cooperative committee, our cooperative did not engage in any non-productive construction. Someone who visited our cooperative said to me: "Before I came, I thought that the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative was an old cooperative with great achievements, and I thought it must have been built very magnificently. But when I saw it, I felt cold. Six accountants, one custodian, and the credit cooperative all live in three rooms, plain and ordinary, only in name. But after actually seeing and hearing the introduction, I realized that you have truly implemented the central government's policy of diligent and thrifty cooperative management." Their views and ideas have also changed. Our cooperative also paid attention to tapping potential from all aspects and reducing the expenses of non-production personnel. For example, the investment of scrap iron by cooperative members alone (broken pots, old iron, and some unusable farm tools, etc.) amounted to more than 20,000 jin. Our cooperative has its own blacksmith furnace and used it to make small farm tools such as iron rakes, hoes, and spades, turning waste into finished products, which saved a lot of money.

    We also accumulated more than 80,000 cartloads of soil fertilizer and urine fertilizer (400 jin per cart), reducing the use of chemical fertilizers. Speaking of the cadres in the cooperative, we originally estimated that we would need more than 20 people, but now there are only 9 non-production cadres. Due to the strengthening of production management and the improvement of labor organization, the work has also become busier. In this way, not only has the production cost been reduced, but also the cooperative members have benefited, and everyone is very satisfied. I directly realized that the central government's policy of "diligent and thrifty cooperative management" is extremely correct and timely.

    In accordance with the central government's instructions, we have also developed a diversified economy in the sideline production, on the premise of not affecting agricultural production and increasing production. Our cooperative now has more than ten kinds of sideline businesses such as carpentry, blacksmith furnace, construction, transportation, flour mill, oil press, pig and chicken raising, vegetable garden, and lime and brick kilns. The average monthly net profit is six or seven thousand yuan, and the estimated annual income is seventy or eighty thousand yuan, which has solved some of the cooperative's expenses, reduced borrowing money from the state, and also increased the income of the cooperative members, solving the difficulty of the members' daily small expenses. According to my practical experience, as mentioned in the reports of Minister Liao and Vice Premier Deng Zihui, without developing a diversified economy and carrying out sideline production, it is difficult to increase the personal income of more than 90% of cooperative members, even if there is a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. This is indeed the case, because there is a limit to land and labor, and the output can only reach a certain level. From our experience, the benefits of sideline production are also numerous. For example, our cooperative made more than 400 well rims and repaired more than 400 carts and other various farm tools, all from the profits of sideline production. At the same time, the cooperative has carpenters and blacksmiths, and the commonly used farm tools and carts can be repaired at any time if they break, which saves money and does not delay production. They can also improve or create some small new farm tools according to the local actual situation, which is also good for agricultural technology reform. Especially after the establishment of advanced cooperatives, the implementation of remuneration according to labor greatly increased the enthusiasm of cooperative members for production, and there was some surplus labor. The development of handicraft production can properly arrange labor, and can also solve the difficulties of old, weak, disabled, widowed and lonely households without labor. Because land is not distributed for dividends in advanced cooperatives, and income is earned by earning work points through more labor, they have no way to earn a living, and relying solely on the cooperative's care is also passive. Our cooperative placed the elderly, disabled, and other people who could not do heavy work in the flour mill or other sideline production departments to do as much as they could. For example, a cooperative member named Ma Shao could not do heavy physical labor due to illness in his early years, so he peeled flour sheets, pasted flour sheets, and swept the courtyard in the flour mill. In addition, Wang Ting and Sun Anwu were both disabled and could not work downhill, so they were assigned to manage the lime kiln work according to their specialties (one could write and the other could burn lime), solving their production and living problems. The work points they earned were not as many as those of strong young people, but they accumulated over time. Therefore, from these specific things in our cooperative, we have further realized that agricultural production must be combined with sideline production, and the development of a diversified economy can achieve the goal of increasing the income of more than 90% or even 100% of cooperative members. In addition, we have also realized that this is also a concrete manifestation of the superiority of advanced cooperatives. Why? Self-employment goes without saying, and primary cooperatives cannot do it either, because you have money but no technical personnel, and you have technical personnel but may not have enough money. We encountered this point at the beginning. When the cooperative was small, we wanted to run a flour mill, but there was only one person who knew how to make flour, and there were difficulties in all aspects. Later, when the cooperative became larger, there were six or seven people who knew how, and the problem of funds and technical personnel was easily solved. Now, the cooperative members are happy to say: "Our cooperative has everything, blacksmiths, carpenters, oil presses, and flour mills. We don't ask for help from anyone. Even the landlords and rich peasants in the past only had an oil press or a wine shop at most," which makes the cooperative members see the happy prospects of socialism even more. They don't care about whether they have those two mu of land at all. So, does engaging in sideline businesses affect agricultural production? As long as the organization is good, it does not affect it. Our cooperative has more than 4,000 laborers, 240 fixed workers in sideline businesses, and about 200 temporary workers. Not only does their production exceed their agricultural labor income, but also because the cooperative members have a high enthusiasm for production after the advanced cooperative, the improvement of labor efficiency has far exceeded the number of workers used in sideline businesses.

    Finally, I have a few suggestions: (1) It is certain that we should develop a diversified economy of sideline businesses in agricultural production cooperatives. However, can we develop handicrafts? This question is still a question in the cooperatives. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives of the county and district believe that the transformation of handicrafts is their business, and that handicraftsmen in rural areas should all be concentrated in the handicraft cooperatives in the district. Their reason is that this is convenient for leadership and beneficial for development, and it is not suitable to put them in agricultural cooperatives. We have different views. Taking iron and wood industries as examples, they are closely related to our agricultural cooperatives. If they are concentrated in the district, it will be very inconvenient for the production of agricultural cooperatives. For example, our cooperative has 470 small carts. Because the production is busy and the cooperative members are very enthusiastic, the carts are used very frequently. Even if we pay attention to saving, we have to replace the axles and ears several times a year. Other farm tools are also often damaged. If there are carpenters in the cooperative, they can repair and replace them without spending cash. Usually, if there is a problem with the axle, foot, or other farm tools, it can be repaired immediately. If the carpenters are concentrated in the district, it will take a dozen or twenty miles to go back and forth, and the handicraft cooperative has its own plans, so it will take three or five days to get in line to repair a farm tool, and the production will be delayed. For example, one cooperative had a seeder with a small problem on the corner, and it took 25 miles to wait for 3 days to repair it. As the cooperative develops, the construction of pigsties, cowsheds, threshing floors, houses, and making doors and windows all require carpenters. If you ask others to do it, not only is it not timely and inconvenient, but the most headache is that you have to pay cash. If you don't have money, the handicraft cooperative cannot owe you money. If there are carpenters in the cooperative, the problem is solved. Now, the cooperative has a large number of new farm tools, double-wheeled double-plow plows, and waterwheels, etc. The farmers actually know how to use them, but the problem is that there is no way to fix them if there is a small problem. Sending them to the district for repair is as inconvenient as repairing the seeder. If there are blacksmiths in the cooperative, they can not only make small farm tools, but also repair new farm tools, which will play a significant role. Furthermore, iron and wood workers are unwilling to be concentrated in the district to join the handicraft cooperative. A carpenter in our cooperative said to me: "Please ask the government, if I join the advanced cooperative, am I considered transformed? If I am, I will not go to the district. If not, I will not be a carpenter." There is reason for this if you study it carefully, and you cannot casually put the hat of "backwardness" on them. Most of the carpenters in rural areas are half farmers and half workers. They are carpenters in the slack season and go to the ground to grow crops in the busy season. Adding the income from both aspects, they can make a living. If he is concentrated in the handicraft cooperative and earns 20 yuan a month, the money goes into his hand and the food goes into his mouth, and there is not much left. Although the women in the family have joined the cooperative, they have limited labor to take care of children and housework, and they do not earn many work points, so life is difficult, and there is a great danger of withdrawing from the cooperative. Some of our county and district cadres do not conduct in-depth investigations into the lives of the masses and the production requirements of the cooperatives. They blindly emphasize the implementation of the instructions of the higher authorities and hold a simple task view, so the masses are naturally dissatisfied. The handicraftsmen in our cooperative insist on not being concentrated, but we did not have a basis in the past. Although Article 27 of the current regulations stipulates the development of sideline production, including handicraft production, it is still suggested that the government should define the boundaries of sideline business, which belongs to the supply and marketing cooperative and which belongs to the agricultural cooperative, and the organization of handicraft cooperatives can be divided into regions and conditions. For example, in areas where agriculture is the main industry, it is better to put wood and iron workers in agricultural cooperatives. But it is also necessary to pay attention to the fact that the development of sideline businesses must also start from the conditions and should be carried out in a planned way according to the actual situation to prevent blind development. (2) Farmland water conservancy construction was originally a long-term plan, but the county and district cadres unilaterally pursued figures and did not proceed from reality. Taking well drilling as an example, the higher authorities repeatedly demanded figures, and the figures rose every two or three days. Later, it was about one well for every 15 mu of land, regardless of the height of the terrain, the direction of the water source, or whether it was needed or not. Anyway, 15 mu were combined into one well, some were drilled on the mountains, some were drilled by the river, and some could not produce water. After drilling 200 wells, there were no bricks, and many of them collapsed after a winter of frozen soil, so they had to be repaired. Some were filled in. There were so many wells, but there were very few water lifting tools. Some wells with water could not get water because there were no water lifting tools. This blind work regardless of location conditions caused a lot of waste of manpower and material resources, which is not in line with the policy of "diligent and thrifty cooperative management". All this is inseparable from the contracting and substitution of district and township cadres and cooperative cadres. If they listen more to the opinions of cooperative members and the cooperative committee, the problem will not be so serious. According to a representative at this conference, some resident cooperative cadres asked the cooperative to build a basketball court in each production team. Nine teams would have to spend thousands of yuan on nine sets of basketball stands and nine balls, and each team would also have a health care kit. Some resident cooperative cadres also complained that the cooperative management committee could not make big plans and asked "who can make big plans". He only knew that he was supplied by the state and received his salary on time, but he did not know that it was not easy for the common people to earn money. "If you are not in charge of a household, you don't know the price of firewood, rice, oil, and salt." He did not think that the cooperative members had so much money, and they did not have the leisure to play basketball. (3) There are also problems in the supply of farm tools by the supply and marketing cooperatives to the countryside. The supply does not meet the agricultural season or the needs of the masses. For example, some places reported: some double-wheeled double-plow plows were transported after the land was cultivated, and manure spreaders were transported after the sowing was done. The supply was very untimely. Furthermore, the supply and marketing cooperatives purchased meat products (cattle, pigs, etc.) in rural areas at very low prices, but sold them at high prices. As a result, the cooperative and the masses were unwilling to raise pigs and cattle, which also caused a shortage of meat supply in the cities. This problem should also be paid attention to and solved.

    That's all I have to say. There are also many shortcomings in the work of our cooperative. After returning this time, we will definitely work with the cooperative members to study the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives well, and under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee and government, run our cooperative better and strive to overfulfill this year's production tasks.

    勤俭办社，发展多种经济
    ——吕鸿宾代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长、彭真副委员长的报告和高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）。
    高级社的示范章程通过公布后，会使得全国的广大农民兄弟欢欣鼓舞的，因为这个章程对生产经营、劳动组织、开展多种经济生产以及股份基金等问题，都有了详细明确的规定，如股份基金在初级社时是按土地交纳或土劳同交的办法，可是高级社后土地不分红了，再照过去按土地交股份基金就有很多问题。章程上明文规定股份基金按劳力分摊，我认为这是很合理很正确的。所以这个章程的制定会使合作社今后的发展、进一步提高生产更有了明确的目标和方向。拿我个人来说，有了这个章程，工作也好，生产也好，心里就更亮堂更大胆了。
    现在我把俺社里执行勤俭办社，发展多种经济的情况，向大会简单汇报汇报。俺那个社也是由小到大。起初只有3户，现在已有1，771户、8，300多口人，经营着2万多亩地的高级社了。几年来在上级党委和政府的正确领导和支援下，不断增加了生产，发挥了组织起来的优越性，社员收入也显著增加，可是总觉着手头上紧，社里的一些开支，社员个人的日常零化销都有困难，有时不得不去向国家贷款。
    自从中央提出勤俭办社，号召我们加强经营管理，开展多种经济生产后，我们社坚决执行了。我简单说一说：对勤俭办社，开始有些人觉得合作化的高潮到来，好像是钱也给潮来了，有的社员就产生了喜新厌旧的思想，旧式农具也不愿意用了，想摆阔气要面子。有些干部也有这种想法，说“咱们社这样出名，起码也得盖上个大礼堂，不然太不好看了”。这也是一个必然的规律。可是要知道，家从勤俭起，老农民有句俗话“吃饭穿衣量家当”，光想办好不行，还得看看社里有没有钱？拿得出来拿不出来？向国家贷款吧不行，叫社员投资吧也有限，生产投资不够，老百姓是“有钱不置半年闲”。况且社员手里也都不宽裕，所以根据社委会研究，俺社对非生产性建设一概都没搞，有个参观俺社的人对我说：“没来以前想，爱国农业合作社是老社，有很大成就，我想一定是建设得也很辉煌，可是一看心里就冷淡了，六个会计、一个保管，还有信用社同住着三间屋，平平常常有名无实。但实际看到和听了介绍，才体会到你们是真正执行了中央勤俭办社的方针。”他们的看法和想法也变过来了。我们社还注意了从各方面挖潜力，减少非生产人员的开支。如仅是社员投资废铁（破锅、旧铁与一些不能再用的农具等）一项就有两万多斤，俺社里自己又有铁匠炉就用它做成了铁耙、镐、锄等小农具，利用废物制成成品，这样剩了很多钱。
    土肥尿肥也积了8万多车子（每车400斤），少用了化学肥料。再拿社里的干部说，原来预计得用20多个才行，现下非生产干部只有9个，由于加强了生产管理，健全了劳动组织，工作也忙过来了。这样，不但生产成本降低，也使社员得到了好处，大家很满意。我直接的体会到，中央提出“勤俭办社”的方针是极为正确和及时的。
    副业生产，我们也按照中央指示，在不影响农业生产和增产的前提下，开展了多种经济的生产。俺社里现下有木丛、铁匠炉、建筑、运输、粉房、油房、养猪养鸡、菜园及石灰、砖瓦窑等十余种副业。每月平均收入纯利润六、七千元，全年预计收入七、八万元，解决了社里的一些开支，减少了向国家借钱，同时也增加了社员的收入，解决了社员日常零用化销的困难。根据我的实际体验，正如廖部长、邓子恢副总理报告中都提到的，不发展多种经济，开展副业生产，光指着粮食、棉花，就是丰收也很难使90％以上社员增加个人收入。确实是这样子，因土地、劳力都有个限度，产量只能达到一定程度的。从我们的经验看，副业生产的好处还多得很，比方俺社从副业生产利润里做了400多个井盘，400多辆车子的修理和其他各种农具的损坏修理费都从副业中解决了。同时社里有了木匠，铁匠，平常使用的农具、车子坏根轴、断个把的也可随时修理好，剩了钱又耽误不了生产。他们还可以根据当地的实际情况来改进或创造些小型新农具，对农业技术改革也有好处。特别是成立高级社以后，实行按劳取酬，社员生产积极性大大提高，劳动力有些剩余，开展了手工业生产就可以适当安排劳力，还可以解决老弱残疾、鳏寡孤独等无劳动力户的困难。因为高级社土地不分红，是靠劳力挣工分多劳多得，这样他们就没办法，光指望社里照顾也是消极的。我们社就把干不了重活的老年人、残废人等放在粉房或其他副业生产部门里去，干多是多干少是少。如一个叫马芍的社员因早年积下了病不能做重体力劳动，就在粉房里揭粉片、贴粉片，扫扫院子。另有王亭、孙安五都是残废腿不能下坡干活，就根据他俩的特长（一个会写字，一个会烧石灰）叫他们来管理石灰窑的工作，解决了他们的生产和生活问题。他们挣的工分虽不如壮年人多，可是搁不着天长日久就多了。所以从俺社这些具体事，更体会到农业生产必须与副业生产结合，发展多种经济，才能达到使90％以上甚至100％社员增加收入的。另外还体会到这也是高级社优越性的具体表现。为什么呢？单干就不用说了，初级社也办不到，因为你有钱没有技术人员，有技术人员也可能钱不够用。开始我们就碰到过这一点，社小的时候，想办个粉房，只有一个会做粉的，各方面条件都有困难。后来社大了就有了六、七个会的，资金问题、技术人员问题就容易解决了。现在社员都高兴的说：“咱社是铁匠、木匠、油房代粉房样样都有，万事不求人，就是过去的地主富农也顶多有个油房、酒店”，使社员更看到了社会主义的幸福远景，对自己那2亩地有没有，根本也就不在意了。那么搞副业是否影响农业增产呢？只要组织得好不影响。俺社有4，000多劳动力，副业固定工人240，临时工约200人，不仅他们的生产超过其农业劳动收入，更因为高级社以后社员生产积极性很高，劳动效率的提高也远远赶过副业上的用工数。
    最后我有几点意见：（1）在农业生产合作社里要发展多种经济的副业，这是肯定的，但是，能不能发展手工业呢？这个问题在合作社里始终还是个疑问。县、区供销合作社的干部认为手工业改造是他们的事，农村里的手工业者应一律集中到区里的手工业合作社去，他们的理由是这样便于领导有利发展，放在农业社里不合适。我们却有不同看法。拿铁业、木业来说，和俺们农业社有密切关系，如集中到区对农业社的生产很不便利。譬如，俺社有470辆小推车，生产忙又加社员积极性高，小车使唤得很勤，注意节约，一年也得换几次车轴、车耳，其他农具也常有损坏，如社里有木匠不用化现钱就修换好了。平时车轴、车脚以及别的农具出点毛病，立即可修理好，如果把木匠集中到区，来回一、二十里路，人家手工业合作社又有人家自己的计划，去修件农具三天五天还排不上号，修好了生产也就给耽误了。如有一个社有一张耧就是角上有一点小毛病，跑出25里地等了3天才修好。合作社发展起来，修建猪栏、牛棚、场院屋子、做个门窗……都需要木匠。如果找人家给做不光是不及时不便利，最头痛的是要拿现钱，没有钱人家手工业合作社还不能欠账。要是社里有木匠，问题就解决了。现下社里有大批新式农具、双轮双铧犁和水车等，农民使起来实际没有什么不会的，问题是出点小毛病没办法，送到区里去修也和修耧一样不方便，社里如有铁匠，他们不但打些小农具，还可修理新式农具，起的作用就不小。再说，铁、木匠也不愿意集中到区去入手工业合作社。俺社有个木匠对我说：“请问问政府，俺入了高级社算不算改造了，如果算我就不到区里去，不算，我就不当木匠了。”这里面仔细研究是有道理的，不能随便给他们戴上“落后”的帽子。农村里的木匠多是半农半工，农闲时当木匠，农忙时下地种庄稼，两方面收入加起来生活就过得去。把他集中到手工业合作社，一月赚二十元工资，钱到手、饭到口，所剩不多，家里的妇女虽入了社，带孩子管家务劳动力有限，挣工分不多生活就困难，很有退社的危险。我们的一些县、区干部不深入调查群众生活上和社里生产的要求，一味强调执行上级指示，抱着单纯任务观点，自然群众就不满意。我们社的手工业者就坚持不愿集中，可是我们过去也没有个根据，如今章程二十七条上虽有规定，发展副业生产其中包括手工业生产，还是建议政府是否对副业经营的界限规定一下，那些属供销社，那些归农业社，并在组织手工业合作社可分地区、条件，如以农业为主的地区，木、铁匠等还是放在农业社里好些。但也要注意一点，发展副业也必须从条件出发，应根据实际情况有计划的搞，防止盲目的发展。（2）农田水利建设原是长期规划的东西，县、区干部片面地追求数字，不从实际出发。拿打井来说，上级一再要求数字，三日两头向上涨，后来就约十五亩地一眼井，也不管你地势高低，水源流向，需不需要，反正是十五亩合一口井，有的打在山上的，打在河旁的，有的就打不出水。打了200眼井又没有砖砌，过了一冬土一冻许多都塌了，只好重修，有的填上了事。那么多井又只有很少的提水工具，有些有水的井，也因没有提水工具，弄不上水来。这样不顾地点条件的盲干，使人力物力浪费不小，不合于“勤俭办社”方针。这一切和区、乡干部和社内干部的包办代替是分不开的，他们如果多听听社员和社委会的意见，问题也不会这样严重。据这次会上有一位代表说有的住社干部要合作社每一个生产队建上一个篮球场，九个队就得九付球架九个球得花千数元，还要每一个队一个保健箱。还有的住社干部嫌社的管委会不会打大谱，问“谁能打大谱”。他光知道他是国家供给按时领工资，就不知道老百姓的来钱不易，“不当家不知道柴米贵”，他不想想社员那有这么多钱，又那有这些闲工夫去打球玩呢？（3）供销社对农村的农具供应上也存在问题，供应的不合农时或不适应群众的要求，如有的地方反映：地耕好了又运去一些双轮双铧犁，播种都弄好才运去撒粪箱，供应很不及时。再是供销社在农村收购肉产品
  （牛、猪等）时以很低价收买，但用高价出卖。弄得社里和群众都不愿意养猪养牛了，因而也造成城市里肉类供应的紧张。这个问题也应注意解决。
    以上就谈这些。俺社里的工作也存在不少缺点，这次回去后，一定和社员一起，很好的学习高级农业生产合作社示范章程，在上级党委和政府领导下，把俺社办得更好，争取超额完成今年的生产任务。
