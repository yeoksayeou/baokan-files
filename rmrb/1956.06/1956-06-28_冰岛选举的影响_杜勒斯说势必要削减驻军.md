Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said on June 26th that, due to the growing influence of parties in the Icelandic parliamentary elections that are demanding the complete withdrawal of American troops, the United States will have no choice but to reduce the troops stationed at the base in Iceland.

Dulles expressed his views at a secret meeting with Republican senators. It was revealed that although Dulles avoided specifically stating whether all U.S. troops stationed in Iceland must be withdrawn, he said that he believed the voting situation in Iceland indicated that "the number" of military personnel stationed there "must be reduced." At the same time, he also believed that some American bases would have to "reshape" their image.

On the same day, a United Press dispatch from Reykjavik, Iceland, said: The results of the Icelandic parliamentary elections were "a serious setback for the pro-American Icelandic 'Independence Party' and the American cause."

    冰岛选举的影响
    杜勒斯说势必要削减驻军
    新华社27日讯　据美联社华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯六月二十六日说：由于冰岛议会选举中要求美军全部撤退的政党势力的增长，美国将不能不削减驻在冰岛基地的军队。
    杜勒斯在同共和党参议员举行的一次秘密会议上发表了意见。据透露，杜勒斯虽然避免具体说明是否必须撤退驻在冰岛的全部美国军队，但是他说，他认为冰岛的投票情况表明“必须减少”驻在那里的军事人员的数目。同时，他还认为美国有些基地不能不“重新改变”它们的面貌。
    同一天，合众社从冰岛雷克雅未克发出的消息说：冰岛议会的选举结果对亲美的冰岛“独立党人和美国的事业说来是一次严重的挫败”。
