The Yellow River irrigation project in Henan Province is one of the large-scale water conservancy projects undertaken after the nationwide liberation. Since its completion in early 1953, this project has not only ensured the irrigation of more than 500,000 mu of land in the six counties of Xinxiang, Huojia, Yanjin, Yuanyang, Jixian, and Wuzhi (the actual area is 720,000 mu), but also ensured that ships can navigate the Wei River unhindered during the dry season. This has played a huge role in increasing agricultural production and strengthening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

Last winter, vast areas of the North Henan Plain suffered from drought and lack of rain, with only 18.9 millimeters of rainfall throughout the winter in the irrigation area and beyond. Since the beginning of spring, the drought has continued to develop. In areas with poor water conservancy conditions, the drought is seriously threatening the growth of wheat seedlings. However, in the Yellow River irrigation area, where Yellow River water can be used for irrigation at any time, this threat of drought does not exist. No matter how dry the climate is, as long as the water gate built on the Yellow River levee is opened, the Yellow River water flows through the 52.7-kilometer-long main canal, through various canals, branch canals, bucket canals, farm canals, and capillary canals, all the way to the fields, ensuring the healthy growth of wheat in the irrigation area.

Since the basic realization of agricultural socialist cooperation in the vast rural areas of the Yellow River-Wei River irrigation area last winter, a high tide of agricultural production increase has rapidly emerged. Through the vigorous construction of water conservancy by the cooperatives, the irrigated area of the irrigation area will increase from 720,000 mu to 940,000 mu. On February 23rd this year, just when the wheat fields needed irrigation, the Yellow River water flowed smoothly into the fields along the canals at all levels, and a spring irrigation campaign quickly unfolded. As of the cessation of rainfall on March 15th, 430,000 mu of farmland (320,000 mu of wheat fields and 110,000 mu of cotton fields) in the entire irrigation area received sufficient water, and the fertilizer applied to the wheat fields dissolved in the water and quickly took effect. Patches of green wheat seedlings grew vigorously. On the vast plain, the songs of agricultural production cooperative members and the sound of sowing machine motors were intertwined. The members pointed to the water channels and said: "We can't do without it!"

"The Yellow River irrigation project has brought happiness." The farmers in the irrigation area say this as soon as they open their mouths. However, when the small-scale peasant economy was dominant, there were great difficulties in the management of the Yellow River-Wei River project, and the efficiency of water use was not high. The spring irrigation situation this year is very different from the past. According to the statistics at the time of the spring irrigation water shutdown on March 15th, the average water use efficiency of the entire irrigation area was 1,517 mu (the amount of land irrigated by each net flow per day and night), an increase of 173.9% compared with the spring irrigation last year, and the efficiency of some branch canals reached 1,989 mu, which is a great improvement. This is because agricultural cooperation has brought many favorable conditions to irrigation work. The contradiction between the decentralized management of the small-scale peasant economy and the large-scale canal management has been resolved, and many things that could not be done in the past can now be done (such as land occupation for canal construction, investment, and intercropping irrigation, etc.). After cooperation, agricultural work can be planned and arranged comprehensively, and labor can be unified and allocated and used, which overcomes the contradiction between irrigation and other agricultural work. In order not to delay watering for fertilization, the Xiaoji Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinxiang County adopted the method of applying fine fertilizer to the land that was watered first and coarse fertilizer to the land that was watered later, so that all 4,900 mu of wheat in the cooperative were top-dressed before watering. The Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangle Township, Jixian County, transferred production teams with small watering tasks to support Liulitang Village, which had large watering tasks, solving the latter's labor shortage. After cooperation, the management and use of irrigation projects are closely integrated, and the contradictions between the order, timing, amount, and location of watering have been overcome, changing the chaotic phenomenon of not watering at the beginning, rushing to water in the middle, and chaotic watering at the end. The agricultural production cooperative members' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for the management and use of irrigation projects has also increased. Many watering teams are camping in the field, taking turns day and night, greatly reducing the waste of dike breaks and water leakage and nighttime drainage. For example, during the summer irrigation last year, there were 30 dike breaks in branch canals and 239 dike breaks in bucket canals, and more dike breaks in farm and capillary canals; during the spring irrigation this year for 21 days, there were only 6 dike breaks in branch canals and 23 dike breaks in bucket canals. According to the statistics of the Fanzhuang Management Section, the number of dike breaks in farm and capillary canals decreased by 64% compared with the same period last year.

This spring irrigation proves that the canal management work has taken a step forward, but from the perspective of the entire irrigation area, there are still some shortcomings and problems. That is, the amount of water diverted from the canal head is not enough, the phenomenon of water waste still exists, and the water resources that should be used have not been fully utilized. In order to fully tap the potential of irrigation, in addition to strengthening the leadership of the original canal management work, large-scale expansion and comprehensive development must be carried out. That is to reinforce the canal head and main canal, and increase the amount of water diverted from the current 50 cubic meters per second to 70 cubic meters per second. It is necessary to carry out canal system improvement and irrigation area expansion, and expand the irrigated area from 720,000 mu to 1.6 million mu. Two hydropower stations should be built at the No. 1 and No. 3 drops on the main canal, generating 900 kilowatts to 1,200 kilowatts. In addition to pumping water to irrigate more than 120,000 mu of farmland, it will also supply electricity for agricultural product processing and rural lighting. Three agricultural machinery stations should be established in the irrigation area, and the mechanized cultivated area should be expanded from 50,000 mu to 400,000 mu. After the completion of these construction projects, some villages in the Yellow River irrigation area can be built into mechanized and electrified socialist agricultural areas.

At present, the first phase of the irrigation area expansion project (including the reinforcement of the canal head gate and main canal, the installation of the diversion system, the reconstruction of the sedimentation basin, the expansion of the original irrigation area, and the power generation at the No. 3 drop) has been basically completed, and the second phase of the project (including the construction of the Wujia irrigation area and the power generation at the No. 1 drop) is about to begin. All projects are scheduled to be completed in the first half of 1957. Three agricultural machinery stations have been established in the irrigation area, and the mechanized cultivated area has reached more than 200,000 mu.

    引黄灌溉区的今天和明天
    河南省引黄灌溉济卫管理局局长　牛立峰
    河南省引黄灌溉济卫工程，是全国解放后举办的大型水利工程之一。这项工程自1953年初完成后，不仅保证了新乡、获嘉、延津、原阳、汲县、武陟六个县的五十多万亩土地的灌溉（实际面积是七十二万亩），而且保证了船只在卫河枯水期仍能航行无阻。这对于增加农业生产，加强城乡物资交流，都发生了巨大作用。
    去年冬季，豫北平原广大地区，一直干旱缺雨，灌区内外整个冬季仅降雨18.9公厘。入春以来，旱象仍然继续发展。在水利条件较差的地区，旱象在严重地威胁着麦苗的发育生长。但是在随时都可以用黄河水灌溉的引黄灌区，这种旱灾的威胁是不存在的。无论气候怎样干旱，只要把建筑在黄河大堤上的引水闸门打开，黄河的水就通过52.7公里长的总干渠，通过各个干渠、支渠、斗渠、农渠、毛渠，一直流到田间去，保证了灌区内的小麦生长茁壮。
    引黄济卫灌区的广大农村自从去年冬季基本上实现了农业社会主义合作化以后，迅速兴起了农业增产高潮。经过合作社大力兴修水利，灌区的灌溉面积将由七十二万亩增加到九十四万亩。今年二月二十三日，正当麦田需要灌溉的时候，黄河水顺着各级渠道平平稳稳地流到了田间，一个春灌运动迅速展开。截至三月十五日落雨止，全灌区有四十三万亩农田（麦田三十二万亩、棉田十一万亩）得到了充分的水量，施到麦田里的肥料遇水溶解以后，很快地便发挥了作用，一片片绿油油的麦苗茁壮地生长起来。在辽阔的平原上，成群结队的农业生产合作社社员们的歌声和播种机的马达声交织在一起。社员们指着引水渠道说：没有它可是不行呀！
      “引黄灌溉工程带来了幸福。”灌区的农民一开口就这么说。但是在小农经济占优势的时候，在引黄济卫工程的管理上有很大的困难，用水效率不高。今年春灌情况和过去大不相同了。据三月十五日春灌停水时候的统计，全灌区平均用水效率为1，517亩（每个净流量一昼夜浇地数量），较去年春灌的时候提高173.9％，有的支渠效率达到1，989亩，这是一个很大的进步。这是因为农业合作化给灌溉工作带来了许多有利条件。过去小农经济的分散经营和大规模的渠道管理之间的矛盾解决了，许多办不到的事，现在办到了（如修渠占地，投资和插花地灌溉等）。合作化以后农活可以全面地规划和安排，劳力可以统一调配和使用，这就克服了灌溉和其它农活之间的矛盾。新乡县小冀农业生产合作社为了施肥不误浇水，采取了先浇的地施细肥、后浇的地施粗肥的办法，使全社四千九百亩小麦，在浇水前全部施了追肥。汲县上乐乡第二农业生产合作社抽调浇地任务不大的生产队去支援浇地任务大的琉璃堂村，解决了后者的劳力不足的问题。合作化以后，灌溉工程的管理和使用密切结合起来，浇地的先后、迟早、上下、多少之间的矛盾克服了，改变了过去那种开始不浇、中间抢浇，最后乱浇的混乱现象。农业生产合作社社员对灌溉工程的管理和使用的责任心和积极性也提高了，不少浇地队都是野外宿息，昼夜轮流，大大地减少了决口跑水和夜间排水的浪费。如去年夏灌期间，还发生支渠决口三十次，斗渠决口239次，农、毛渠决口更多；今年春季灌溉二十一天，仅仅发生支渠决口六次、斗渠决口二十三次。据樊庄管理段统计，农渠、毛渠决口比去年同期减少了64％。
    这次春灌证明，渠道管理工作前进了一步，但是从整个灌区来说，还有一些缺点和问题。这就是渠首的引水量还没有引够，用水的浪费现象仍然存在，应该利用的水力资源也没有充分利用起来。为了充分发掘灌溉的潜力，除加强对原有渠道管理工作的领导以外，还要进行大规模的扩建和全面的发展。这就是要加固渠首和总干渠，把引水量由现在的五十秒公方增加到七十秒公方。要进行渠系改善和灌区扩展，把灌溉面积由七十二万亩扩大到一百六十万亩。要在总干渠上一号和三号跌水举办两处水力发电站，发电九百瓩到一千二百瓩，除扬水灌溉十二万多亩农田外，还要供给农产品加工和农村照明用电。在灌区内要建立起三个农业机器站，把机耕面积由五万亩扩大到四十万亩。完成了这些建设工程，就可以把引黄灌区的一部分村庄建设成为机械化、电气化的社会主义的农业区。
    目前灌区扩建的第一期工程（包括渠首闸和总干渠加固，导流系统安装，沉沙池改建，原来灌区扩展，三号跌水发电等）已基本完成，第二期工程（包括新建武嘉灌区和一号跌水发电等）即将开始。全部工程争取在1957年上半年完成。灌区内三个农业机器站已经建立起来，机耕面积达二十多万亩。
