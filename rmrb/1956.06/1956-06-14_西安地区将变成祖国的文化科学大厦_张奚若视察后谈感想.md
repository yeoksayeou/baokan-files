Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 13th. National People's Congress representative Zhang Xiruo, after inspecting the educational work in the Xi'an area, shared his thoughts with reporters, saying, "A world of difference" is my impression of this inspection.

Zhang Xiruo mentioned that after arriving in Xi'an, he saw new buildings inside and outside this ancient city, including new factories, new cinemas, theaters, and especially many new schools. Before liberation, Xi'an only had two universities and one secondary technical school, but now the number of universities has increased to six, and there are nineteen secondary technical schools. When he went to the southern suburbs of Xi'an for inspection, he saw new school buildings for geology schools, coal mining schools, as well as petroleum, construction engineering, automobile machinery, civil engineering, animal husbandry, and other schools along the way. Nearly thirty schools were clustered in an area spanning dozens of miles, with rows of high-rise buildings standing there. China's first power university—Xi'an Power Institute—and the new Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering and the Northwest Medical College, which will receive new students this summer, are under intensive construction, with their magnificent teaching buildings and dormitories. Zhang Xiruo inspected Xi'an Normal College and Shaanxi Normal College, two new universities built after liberation; at Northwest University, he carefully viewed and understood the science building, which can accommodate more than a thousand people, and many new teaching facilities built after liberation. He said that before liberation, this nominal university now truly resembles a university.

Zhang Xiruo also inspected ten middle and primary schools in Xi'an. The number of students in ordinary middle and primary schools in Xi'an has also increased by about two times compared to before liberation.

After the inspection, Zhang Xiruo said that during the Kuomintang rule, China's few schools were mostly concentrated along the coast, but now, in just a few years, the prototype of a cultural and scientific base has gradually formed in Xi'an. Zhang Xiruo told reporters that the construction of Xi'an is just beginning now. In a few more years, the cultural cradle of Chinese history—the Xi'an area—will become the cultural and scientific mansion of the motherland.

    西安地区将变成祖国的文化科学大厦
    张奚若视察后谈感想
    新华社西安13日电　全国人民代表大会代表张奚若在视察西安地区的教育工作后，对记者发表感想说：“大非昔比”四个字是我这次视察中的印象。
    张奚若谈到，他来到西安后就看到这座古老的城市内外都是些新起的建筑物，有新的工厂、新的影院、剧院，特别是许多新的学校。解放前西安只有两所高等学校、一所中等技术学校，而现在的高等学校已经增加到六所，中等技术学校有十九座。当他去西安南郊视察的时候，一路上他就看到有地质学校、煤矿学校以及石油、建筑工程、汽车机械、土木建筑、畜牧等学校的新型校舍。在一片几十里长的区域内星聚着近三十座学校，一幢接一幢的高楼大厦矗立在那里。中国第一所动力大学——西安动力学院，今年暑假就要接收新生的新型的西安建筑工程学院和西北医学院的教学大楼、宿舍楼等雄伟的建筑，正在这里加紧修建。张奚若在这里视察了西安师范学院、陕西师范学院这两所解放后新建的高等学校；在西北大学仔细观看了解放后建起的可容纳千多人的科学大楼和许多新型的教学设备。他说，解放前这个有名无实的大学，现在才真正像个大学。
    张奚若还视察了西安的十所中学、小学。现在西安市的普通中学和小学学生也比解放前增加了两倍左右。
    张奚若在视察后说，在国民党统治时代，中国仅有的一些学校也大多集中在沿海一带，现在短短几年间，一个文化科学的基地雏形已在西安逐步形成了。张奚若告诉记者说，现在，西安的建设还刚刚开始，再过些年，中国历史上的文化摇篮——西安一带，将变成祖国的文化科学大厦。
