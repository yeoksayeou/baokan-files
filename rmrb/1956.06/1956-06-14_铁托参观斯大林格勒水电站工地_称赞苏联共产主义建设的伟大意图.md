Xinhua News Agency, citing TASS: Yugoslav President Tito and his party, accompanied by Khrushchev and Mikoyan, left Stalingrad by car on the evening of June 11 for a visit to Krasnodar, arriving in Kropotkin, a city in the Krasnodar Krai, on the 12th.

Having arrived in Stalingrad on the morning of June 11, Tito and his party took a boat trip on the Lenin Volga-Don Canal.

At the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, several thousand hydraulic engineering construction workers gathered to welcome the national leaders of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

Tito, on behalf of the Yugoslav people and the delegation, greeted them. He pointed out that the scale of construction here is vast, and the intentions of the Soviet engineers are great. This intention and its realization are very important to the Yugoslav people who are building socialism. Tito said, therefore, we are very happy to see this intention becoming a reality. Tito concluded by wishing the builders even greater achievements and promising to visit them again after these grand constructions are completed.

Tito's speech was met with thunderous applause.

Following him, Khrushchev also spoke.

Khrushchev said that we came to the heroic Stalingrad with excitement. Not long ago, Stalingrad was still a battlefield stained with the blood of the Soviet people. The Soviet people did not yield to the enemy, but annihilated them and defended their great achievements in order to build a new communist society that has never existed in human history.

Khrushchev said that the richest country in the world now is the United States. However, tomorrow we will be richer than it. To this end, we will build many hydroelectric stations and atomic power stations, and push science and technology forward to make machines replace people's work, and make people become commanders in labor and make labor more productive. We will create conditions for the victory of communism in this way. We frankly say: We have difficulties, we know these difficulties, and we are overcoming these difficulties with our own strength. We are not prepared to ask the capitalists for help. Because as soon as you extend a finger to them, they will bite off your hand.

Khrushchev went on to say that the conflict that once existed between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is over.
	--So we are here to confirm our growing friendship. This friendship is necessary for a common purpose. We must jointly strengthen this friendship.

    铁托参观斯大林格勒水电站工地
    称赞苏联共产主义建设的伟大意图
    新华社据塔斯社讯　南斯拉夫总统铁托等一行，在赫鲁晓夫和米高扬陪同下，在六月十一日晚间乘车离开斯大林格勒前往克拉斯诺达访问，十二日到达克拉斯诺达边疆区的克鲁泡特金城。
    铁托等在六月十一日上午到达斯大林格勒以后，曾经乘轮船在列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河上游览。
    在斯大林格勒水电站的建筑工地，有几千名水力工程建筑工人聚集在那里欢迎南斯拉夫和苏联的国家领导人。
    铁托代表南斯拉夫人民和代表团向他们问好。他指出，这里建设的规模是庞大的，苏联工程师们意图是伟大的。这种意图和它的实现对正在建设社会主义的南斯拉夫人民说来，是非常重要的。铁托说，因此，我们在看到这种意图正在变成现实的时候，觉得很高兴。铁托最后祝建设者获得更大的成就，并且答应，在这些宏大的建设完工以后，再到他们这里来看看这些建设。
    铁托的讲话博得了暴风雨般的掌声。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫也讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们怀着激动的心情来到英雄的斯大林格勒。就在不久以前，斯大林格勒还是流满了苏联人鲜血的战场。苏联人民但没有对敌人表示屈服，而且消灭了他们，保卫住了自己伟大的成果，这是为了建设人类历史上从来不曾有过的共产主义的新社会。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在世界上最富的国家是美国。但是，明天我们将比它更富。为了这个目的，我们将建设许多水电站、原子能电力站，将把科学和技术往前推进，使机器代替人来工作，使人在劳动中成为指挥者，使劳动更有生产效率。我们将这样来为共产主义的胜利创造条件。我们坦率地说：我们有困难，我们知道这些困难，我们在用自己的力量克服这些困难。我们不准备请求资本家帮助。因为只要向他们伸出一个手指，他们就会把你的手也咬下来。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联和南斯拉夫之间曾经有过的冲突已经过去了。
    ——所以我们来到这里证实我们日益强烈的友谊。为了共同的目的，这种友谊是必要的。我们要共同加强这种友谊。
