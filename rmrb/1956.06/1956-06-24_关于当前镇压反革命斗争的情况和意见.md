On the Current Situation and Opinions on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Struggle
Luo Ruiqing, Director of the First Office of the State Council and Minister of Public Security

I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Minister Liao Luyan. I suggest that the Congress approve the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget, and pass the model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives.

The Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Movement Has Achieved Great Victory

Now, I would like to talk about the current situation of the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggles and some of my own opinions on this issue. Please criticize and correct any inappropriate points in my opinions, representatives.

As you may recall, in July of last year, during the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, the destructive activities of the remaining counter-revolutionaries in the country were still very rampant. Many concrete facts demonstrated that at that time, counter-revolutionary elements were conducting or planning to conduct crazy sabotage against our basic construction, industry, commerce, transportation, and agriculture. At that time, people clearly saw how much happiness the completion of the several five-year plans for the development of the national economy would bring to the people of the whole country; however, to tolerate the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements would mean that the smooth progress of national construction and the safety of the people would not be guaranteed. Therefore, the speeches of many representatives unanimously demanded the strengthening of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the resolution of the Second Meeting of the First National People's Congress on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy also appealed to state organs at all levels and the people of the whole country to raise their vigilance and smash the enemy's destructive activities against the construction of our people. This was completely correct, necessary, and reflected the wishes of the broad masses of the people.

Fellow representatives, what I should report to you today is that we have already done so. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of the whole country have waged a resolute struggle, severely cracked down on the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries, and achieved a great victory.

In the past year of struggle, we have arrested a group of counter-revolutionary elements who have engaged in current destructive activities, stopped some major destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and also solved many major counter-revolutionary cases.

In the vigorous development of the agricultural cooperation movement, we resolutely cracked down on a group of counter-revolutionary elements who carried out assassinations, arson, poisoning, harm to livestock, and infiltrated agricultural production cooperatives to carry out destructive activities.

    For example, in Houhe Village, Anshangji Township, Fengqiu County, Henan Province, counter-revolutionary element Zhang Xuede, on the night of October 19 last year, holding a stone pestle and hiding next to the Guandi Temple on the back street, suddenly attacked Comrade Hao Huatang, secretary of the village branch of the Chinese Communist Party, as he was walking home from a meeting, hitting him with the stone pestle and killing him. He then ran to the home of Comrade Shen Guiyue (female), a cadre of the cooperative, and injured her. This crazy murderer was arrested on the spot.

    Counter-revolutionary element Li Tangchun of Shuiji County, Fujian Province, secretly put arsenic into the flour of the agricultural production cooperative on July 22 last year, resulting in the poisoning of 72 members and the death of one person. This counter-revolutionary element was verified and arrested according to law.

    In Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, the agricultural production cooperative run by Zhang Huiying, a representative of the National People's Congress, was one of the first nine old cooperatives to be piloted in the province. Counter-revolutionary element Duan Ruhan infiltrated the cooperative, contacted seven counter-revolutionary elements who had infiltrated the cooperative, organized the counter-revolutionary group "Self-Defense Assault Team," and carried out various destructive activities. However, with the help of the masses, this counter-revolutionary group was cracked down on, and five principal criminals were punished as they deserved.

In the great socialist construction projects, people are carrying out intense construction work while also combating various sabotage and disruptions by counter-revolutionary elements.

    The former drilling company of Jixi Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province had a counter-revolutionary element named Wu Kebao, who colluded with technicians Zhang Diange, Xia Lianqing, and others to organize a counter-revolutionary sabotage group. When they were conducting geological surveys in the Guangyishan area, they used methods such as forging map sheets, fabricating mountain shapes, and randomly changing contour lines to carry out technical sabotage, resulting in completely wrong terrain precision measurement maps, turning high mountains into flat ground, flat ground into high mountains, rivers into mountain tops, and mountain tops into ditches. This caused the two-year survey results to be completely scrapped, not only causing a loss of 80,000 yuan to the state but also seriously affecting the construction progress of the mine. After technical appraisal and careful investigation by the public security organs, this counter-revolutionary group was cracked in August last year.

Our industrial and mining enterprises are launching enthusiastic socialist labor competitions to strive to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceed quotas. In the labor competition, we must also be vigilant and overcome the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, because counter-revolutionary elements very much dislike us completing the economic plan ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas.

    For example, in 1955, when the Shenyang "724" factory launched a competition, a "accident" suddenly occurred in which 90,000 important parts processed in the seventh workshop were not accepted. This was a very heavy blow to the workers and the factory who were enthusiastically competing! After careful investigation, reconnaissance, and technical appraisal, it was discovered that the acceptance technician Wang Zhi was a counter-revolutionary element. He had already carried out one act of sabotage, and this time he deliberately treated a large number of qualified products as unqualified products, refusing to accept them,打击打击工人阶级的积极性，企图破坏工厂的劳动竞赛。This counter-revolutionary element was exposed in time, and the labor competition in the "724" factory unfolded more enthusiastically.

In the transportation industry, for example, counter-revolutionary element Zhong Xianting, a driver of the universal loading and unloading machine at the Dalian Port Authority, used his position to carry out sabotage three times. The last time, he deliberately removed the important shaft pin connecting the left leg of the universal loading and unloading machine to the pump bed, attempting to cause the machine to fall,破坏装卸任务，制造人身伤亡事故，幸而为接班人及时察觉揭发，制止了这一重大破坏阴谋。After investigation and verification, this counter-revolutionary element has been arrested and punished according to law.

In the financial and trade departments, for example, a counter-revolutionary element named Hou Cigong from the Machinery Import Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade deliberately wrote the wrong model number of the instrument on the order form when the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant, affiliated to the First Ministry of Machine Industry, ordered a "gear eccentricity inspection instrument" from abroad last year. When ordering "standard block accessories" from abroad, Hou arbitrarily changed the name and model of the goods, resulting in an accident of ordering the wrong goods. Similar deliberate sabotage accidents, after investigation and verification, numbered as many as seven, all done by Hou Cigong alone, which affected the needs of the user departments and caused serious losses to the state. This counter-revolutionary element was arrested according to law in November last year.

In addition, we have also waged victorious struggles against the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries and achieved success in handicrafts cooperation and the joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce.

The struggle of the past year has severely cracked down on all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. No matter how cleverly they disguised and hid themselves, and escaped many blows, they were finally exposed in this struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

For example, the famous counter-revolutionary element Kong Hechong was captured in Yunnan Province, Li Bangyan, one of Ma Buqing's "three great vajra" who had killed more than 30 revolutionary cadres and soldiers, was captured in Shaanxi Province, and Yuan Wencheng, a major counter-revolutionary element who had helped the enemy arrest a large number of Communist Party members and revolutionary masses after his defection, was captured in Hunan. These important counter-revolutionary elements not only had heinous crimes in history, but also continued to carry out counter-revolutionary criminal activities while lying dormant.

In this struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, Tianjin cracked down on the Kuomintang's "Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, Group 288" spy organization, which had been lurking for many years, arrested more than 30 spies, and seized latent radio stations and pistols. The members of this spy organization tried every means to hide themselves after liberation. One spy infiltrated the China Department Store as a personnel cadre and infiltrated the Communist Party; another spy infiltrated the Tianjin Siyou Primary School as the director of teaching and infiltrated the Communist Youth League as the branch secretary. They cleverly lay dormant for several years and were finally captured this time.

In this struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, 27 "emperors" of reactionary secret societies were captured from caves and secret rooms across the country. Some of them were even wearing dragon robes, preparing to "ascend the throne."

In this struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, a batch of spy cases sent in and lurking by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique were also cracked down on across the country. For example, on May 10 this year, in Dongjiazhuang, Haiyang County, Shandong Province, a case of stowaway spies sent by the US "Central Intelligence Agency" spy organization in Tokyo was cracked down on, and the spy elements Li Tianqing, Wu Bojun, Yuan Amu, and others were all arrested, and silent pistols, special agent cameras, and various communication equipment were seized. Immediately afterwards, on June 6, a small boat sent by the US spy agency was captured. This boat was to pick up the above three spies, but the enemy's wishful thinking did not succeed. Of the three spies on this boat, one was captured alive, one was shot and killed on the spot, and another spy committed suicide by jumping into the sea.

For example, on March 21 this year, Wuhan City captured Jiao Zhibin, a spy sent in by Chiang Kai-shek's "Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense." This spy had already set up a special agent radio station, and just as he was about to send a telegram to the Taiwan spy agency, he was arrested on the spot by our public security organs.

The struggle of the past year has also cleared out a batch of hidden counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements from our state organs, from the Communist Party and various democratic parties, from various people's organizations and the People's Liberation Army, and from the ranks of intellectuals. There is no doubt that clearing out this batch of counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements from our national leadership institutions or key departments and dealing with them seriously and appropriately is of great significance for consolidating our country and ensuring the victory of our country's socialist construction.

The victory of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries has further weakened the remaining counter-revolutionary forces in the country, and has practically guaranteed the smooth progress of our socialist construction and socialist transformation. And through this struggle, the revolutionary vigilance of the people of the whole country has been further improved, creating a favorable situation for thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements.

We Must Emphasize the Close Leadership and Strict Supervision of the Party and Government Over Public Security Organs

The fact that the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries has achieved great victory shows that our struggle is healthy and normal, and that the implementation of the Party and the state's policies in the struggle is firm and correct.

However, does this mean that we have no shortcomings and errors in the struggle? No. Some shortcomings and errors have occurred in our struggle. That is: In the struggle, on the one hand, the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries has not been completely prevented, some important counter-revolutionary cases have not been solved in a timely manner, and some counter-revolutionaries have been missed; on the other hand, a small number of elements who could have been arrested or not have been arrested were arrested, and even individual people who should not have been arrested at all were wrongly arrested. In the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements within various organs, in some units, for a very short period of time, the phenomenon of a too broad scope of struggle occurred, and a small number of people who could have been spared were struggled against, and even individual people who should not have been struggled against at all were wrongly struggled against.

The nature of these shortcomings and errors is local and temporary. According to our legal system, there are many ways to correct them, and they are also relatively easy to correct. Some have already been corrected, and some are being corrected. It would be wrong to deny the victory of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries because of these shortcomings and errors, to think that everything is wrong, and even to regard the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries as unnecessary.

However, it would also be wrong to think that because the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries has achieved victory, we are unwilling to examine the shortcomings and errors in our work, or to not attach importance to the adverse effects of our shortcomings and errors, and to think that it is not necessary to adopt an honest and serious attitude to face up to and correct our own shortcomings and errors.

The reason why the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors occurred is, on the one hand, that our public security organs are not strong enough in their ability to fight against counter-revolutionary elements, and their vigilance is not high enough, and they often show 麻痹大意, thus giving counter-revolutionary elements loopholes to carry out destructive activities; on the other hand, some of our staff members lack political experience and social knowledge, and they are not completely clear when grasping the policy boundaries of the Party and the state towards counter-revolutionary elements, coupled with insufficient investigation and research, and insufficient analysis, therefore, they have made the problems of a few people more serious, and even made mistakes with individuals. However, the main responsibility for these errors lies with the public security leading organs. When explaining policy boundaries to lower-level public security organs, especially grassroots public security organs, we often did not explain clearly enough; the leadership and inspection of actual work were not in-depth enough; and in the process of struggle, the resolution of some important issues was not timely enough. All of these are lessons we should learn from and earnestly improve in our future work.

Fellow representatives! The struggle against counter-revolutionary elements is a serious and complex struggle. The public security organs are one of the specialized organs in charge of this struggle, and they shoulder serious and complex tasks. In order to achieve victory in this struggle without causing major dangers and errors, and even if some shortcomings and errors occur, they can be discovered in time and easily corrected, the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, based on our past experience in struggle, have stipulated some principles that our public security work must abide by. These principles are: We must emphasize the close leadership and strict supervision of the Party and the government over the public security organs, which is a decisive key; we must emphasize mobilizing and relying on the broad masses of the people and accepting the supervision of the broad masses of the people, and oppose isolationism and mysticism that are divorced from the masses; in terms of struggle methods, we must absolutely prohibit torture to extract confessions; we must do a good job in investigation and research, emphasize evidence, and not lightly believe confessions; we must carefully distinguish the merits and demerits of the case, treat them differently, strictly limit the scope of arrests, only arrest those who must be arrested according to law, and do not arrest anyone who could be arrested or not arrested; if errors in work are confirmed during the interrogation process, they must be corrected in a timely and resolute manner; we must emphasize the supervision of state law, especially after the promulgation of the state constitution and several important laws, we must establish a correct relationship of close cooperation and mutual restraint between the procuratorate, the court, and the public security organs, emphasizing strict compliance with the law and acting in accordance with the law. These are essential and important guarantees for the correct conduct of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries. In the struggle, we have generally strictly abided by these principles, so we have achieved victory and have not made major errors that are difficult to correct. However, we have not done everything perfectly, and there are still some shortcomings. Therefore, we must strive to fully abide by these principles in our future work. Only in this way can we more perfectly achieve the two-pronged goal of "improving vigilance and eliminating all special agents" and "preventing deviations and not wrongly accusing a good person."

The Trend of Differentiation and Wavering in the Remaining Counter-Revolutionary Forces is Becoming More and More Significant

The result of the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle in the past year has further weakened the strength of the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, and the number of counter-revolutionary elements has decreased even more than in the past, and the social order in urban and rural areas across the country has become more stable. A few resolute counter-revolutionary elements have become more isolated, and a new situation of further differentiation and disintegration has emerged in the camp of the remaining counter-revolutionary elements.

Since the second half of 1955, the trend of differentiation and wavering in the remaining counter-revolutionary forces has become more and more significant. Up to now, a considerable number of counter-revolutionary elements across the country have surrendered to the People's Government. Among them are counter-revolutionary elements who have been hiding for six or seven years, coming out of caves and hidden walls to surrender; there are counter-revolutionary elements who have committed great evils and have bloody debts in history, who have previously fled everywhere and hid everywhere, and have recently surrendered themselves voluntarily; there are special agents and spies who were sent in from Taiwan and Hong Kong by imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek special agent organs, who surrendered to the People's Public Security Organs not long after entering. Some counter-revolutionary elements who are hiding inside us have also recently come out to confess their problems and ask for lenient treatment. This situation is still developing. The newspapers have recently reported some news in this regard, and I will not give any more examples.

The wavering and differentiation among counter-revolutionary elements deserves our great attention. This is not an accidental phenomenon, but is closely related to the fact that fundamental changes have taken place in our country's political and economic situation.

Last winter and this spring, the great victory of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in our country greatly improved the political consciousness and organizational degree of the people of our country. This unprecedented major change in Chinese history has greatly weakened the social foundation on which counter-revolutionaries depend for their survival, and the loopholes that counter-revolutionary elements can use to carry out activities have also been greatly reduced. This tremendous change cannot but have a profound impact on counter-revolutionary elements. At the same time, the achievements of our country's socialist construction have shattered all the fantasies and deceptions of counter-revolutionaries. Now, as long as they are not political blind men, as long as they are not extremely stubborn counter-revolutionary elements, they can clearly see the bright and splendid future of the Chinese people. All those who once had a little "hope" for Chiang Kai-shek, after seeing this great change with their own eyes, have they not now changed from having a little "hope" to complete despair? Therefore, it is completely understandable that many people in the remaining counter-revolutionary forces want to reconsider their future and change their attitude of opposing the people.

It should be pointed out that the People's Government's policy towards counter-revolutionary elements, especially the provisions of Article 5 of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program, further clearly and specifically pointed out the way out for all wavering and hesitating counter-revolutionary elements, and played a huge role in promoting the disintegration of counter-revolutionary elements.

Correctly Treat and Handle All Counter-Revolutionary Elements Who Surrender Themselves in Accordance with National Policies

We should pay close attention to this trend of differentiation and disintegration among the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, and correctly treat and handle all counter-revolutionary elements who surrender themselves to the People's Government in accordance with the national policy, that is, the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, commutation of punishment for meritorious service, and reward for great meritorious service."

To implement the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, commutation of punishment for meritorious service, and reward for great meritorious service" means:

    All counter-revolutionary elements who only have general historical crimes and no current destructive activities, as long as they honestly confess, the People's Government will no longer pursue their crimes and will try to arrange their work and give them a way out of life.

    All counter-revolutionary elements who have serious historical crimes, blood debts, and public indignation, as long as they honestly confess and no longer commit evil, can also be treated leniently according to law; even those with the most serious crimes, as long as they honestly confess, our People's Court can also exempt them from heavy punishment according to law.

    All counter-revolutionary elements and special agent spies who still maintain contact with the special agent organs of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique and carry out current destructive activities, as long as they sever ties with the enemy, sincerely repent, and honestly confess their crimes, can also be treated leniently according to law; those with the most serious crimes, our People's Court can also exempt them from heavy punishment according to law.

    All counter-revolutionary elements, not only confess themselves, but also expose other counter-revolutionary elements, which, after verification, is considered meritorious service. Those who have performed meritorious service can have their punishment commuted, or even be exempted from criminal punishment. Assisting the government in solving important cases and capturing important counter-revolutionary elements is considered a great meritorious service. Those who have performed great meritorious service can not only have their punishment commuted, but also be rewarded. Of course, those who falsely accuse and frame good people with ulterior motives will be punished by law once they are found out.

    In fact, we are already doing what is said above.

    For example, recently, all localities have leniently treated a group of counter-revolutionary elements, including some counter-revolutionary elements with very serious crimes. Some counter-revolutionary elements with very serious crimes but who have performed great meritorious service have not only been exempted from criminal punishment but have also received rewards from the government.

    In rural areas, according to the provisions of Article 5 of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program, according to the different situations of counter-revolutionary elements, except for a very small number of elements whose crimes are serious, public indignation is great, and who carry out destructive activities and must be arrested according to law, the remaining general elements are all placed in cooperatives as formal members, probationary members, or under controlled production for transformation. Those who are under controlled production are also given the same pay for the same work. In 1956, the vast majority of places across the country will implement this provision. Recently, some places across the country have already implemented this, and a group of former counter-revolutionary elements have joined agricultural production cooperatives.

    For example, according to statistics from 4,028 townships in Henan Province, the vast majority of former counter-revolutionary elements have joined cooperatives. Among them, 14.7% have removed the label of counter-revolutionary and become formal members, 56.1% have become probationary members, and 29.2% are under controlled production by the cooperative.

    For example, according to statistics from 2,701 townships in Guangdong Province, the vast majority of former counter-revolutionary elements have also joined cooperatives. Among them, 12.7% have removed the label of counter-revolutionary and become formal members, 50.6% have become probationary members, and 36.7% are under controlled production by the cooperative.

    Former counter-revolutionary elements who have joined cooperatives and are now probationary members, after a period of labor and education, if they perform well, can be transferred to formal members; those who are now under controlled production can also be transferred to probationary members or formal members.

    In cities, general counter-revolutionary elements should also be properly arranged for work and given a way out of life in accordance with the above spirit. The principle is: for all those who are treated leniently and are under control, as well as those who have been released after serving their sentences, those who have fixed occupations should be arranged in their original industries. Those who have no occupation, or have no fixed occupation and have no means of livelihood, should be sent back to the countryside to participate in production according to the specific circumstances, or organized to migrate for production, or organized to work and find employment locally, and the principle of equal pay for equal work should be implemented for employed elements. Those who have lost their ability to work and have no means of livelihood should be taken in for reform through labor. Some cities, such as Beijing, have already done this and have achieved good results. A group of former counter-revolutionary elements have been introduced to various jobs for labor and employment, and they are very grateful for the measures of the People's Government. Some places across the country, such as Nanjing and Shanghai, are preparing to do so, and other places will gradually do so in accordance with the above principles.

    We believe that former counter-revolutionary elements who have joined cooperatives and have been arranged for employment, as long as they actively work, strive for progress, and work hard to transform themselves, they will surely have a bright and happy future. All former counter-revolutionary elements who are preparing to join cooperatives and are about to be arranged for employment, as long as they also do so, we believe that they will also obtain the same bright future.

    Regarding the families of counter-revolutionary elements, the policy of the People's Government has always been: as long as they have not participated in counter-revolutionary activities, they should have the same rights as ordinary citizens to employment and joining cooperatives, and should not be discriminated against. As for their young children, they originally have the same rights as ordinary young people to study, find employment, and join cooperatives, and should not be subject to any discrimination.

    There are also places where these clear policies have not been implemented well, and all such places must be carefully examined and corrected.

We do this because the situation in our country has undergone fundamental changes, and our struggle must proceed from this changed actual situation. We do this in accordance with the interests of our country's socialist cause and the interests of the broad masses of the people. We need more people to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, and we also have every possibility to transform the majority of elements in the remaining counter-revolutionary forces through labor production and political education. We hope that all those who are still standing outside the socialist cause of the motherland, who have played a negative role and a destructive role in the past, can today make up their minds and take the correct and bright road to play a positive role. For the counter-revolutionary elements themselves, we have rescued them from the abyss of crime and given them the opportunity to start a new life. We have always hoped that counter-revolutionary elements will repent and abandon their counter-revolutionary stand to become useful people in the new society. Now, we have more reason to ask them to make up their minds early, quickly confess their crimes to the People's Government, and join the people of the whole country in building a great socialist society.

The above is for those who are willing to repent and abandon their counter-revolutionary stand. Those lenient treatment principles can only be applied to them. As for those resolute counter-revolutionary elements who are still carrying out destructive activities, especially those who have been treated leniently and then carry out destructive activities, we cannot take any other measures to treat such elements except to resolutely打击打击 them. Because the truth is very clear, if we do not do so, we will make mistakes. And the result of our mistakes will directly harm the country's socialist cause.

The Struggle Between Revolution and Counter-Revolution is Still Sharp and Complex. We Must Fight Counter-Revolutionary Elements to the End

So, are there still such counter-revolutionary elements now? Are there still counter-revolutionary activities?

After the victory of agricultural cooperation, although counter-revolutionary activities in rural areas have been greatly reduced, they have not been completely eliminated. Even recently, incidents of counter-revolutionary conspiracy riots and assassinations have occurred in several regions. For example, on the evening of March 24 this year, bandits from the reactionary "Returning Home Sect" killed one section-level cadre working in Yancun Village, Luancheng County, Hebei Province, and injured one cadre from the county working group, three rural cadres, and two farmers.

Landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and most of them have performed well. However, there are also a few elements who still engage in sabotage after entering the cooperative. In April this year, Yang Wensen, a landlord element under controlled production in the cooperative in Shuiming Township, Langxi County, Anhui Province, killed Yang Chuncai, a member of the cooperative, because Yang Chuncai exposed his crimes.

In factory and mining enterprises, transportation, finance and trade, and other systems, the activities of counter-revolutionary elements creating sabotage accidents and endangering production and construction are still being discovered.

We must not forget that there are still imperialists surrounding us abroad, and there is still the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan, and they have not relaxed their sabotage against us. Since the beginning of this year, the number of special agents sent in by imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek special agent organs has greatly increased. In Guangzhou alone, in the three months from February to April, the number of special agents sent in was nearly double that of the entire last year. On the night of May 1 this year, a rail and a sleeper two kilometers north of Shenzhen, Guangdong, were destroyed by Liu Li, an action agent sent in from Hong Kong by the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organ, using high explosives. This special agent has been captured. Recently, the activities of special agents in many places have also increased somewhat.

These facts show that although counter-revolutionary elements have indeed decreased, they still exist and are still active. Moreover, the remaining part of the resolute counter-revolutionary elements are becoming more and more精打细算, and their sabotage methods are often more狡猾 and more毒辣. Therefore, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is still sharp and complex. Throughout the entire historical period in which classes and class struggle still exist in the country and the world, there will always be counter-revolutionaries, and the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution will always exist. If we ignore this objective fact and become 麻痹自满 because of the victories we have already achieved, it will be very harmful.

At present, the country still has the task of continuing to carry out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and eliminating hidden counter-revolutionaries within. We must continue to work hard and must not slacken off. On the one hand, we must implement our correct policies and strive for more counter-revolutionary elements to confess honestly and surrender themselves; on the other hand, we must actively carry out the joint struggle of the masses and specialized organs to give all elements who dare to carry out counter-revolutionary destructive activities a resolute打击.

We must follow the instructions of Premier Zhou in his report on the issue of intellectuals and strive to victoriously end the movement to suppress counter-revolutionary elements in society and within state organs in the next two years. Of course, even if the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries ends, it does not mean that there is no longer a struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries. As long as there are still counter-revolutionary elements and counter-revolutionary destructive activities, in order to defend the great cause of socialism and in order to defend the safety of the country and the people, we must fight counter-revolutionary elements to the end! The people of the whole country will never give up until the counter-revolutionary elements are completely wiped out!

    关于当前镇压反革命斗争的情况和意见
    国务院第一办公室主任兼公安部长　罗瑞卿
    我完全同意李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和廖鲁言部长的报告，建议大会批准1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，并通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程。
    镇压反革命运动取得了很大的胜利
    现在，我来说一说当前镇压反革命斗争的情况和自己对这个问题的一些意见。我的意见说得不妥当的地方，请各位代表批评、指正。
    大家记得，在去年7月，第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的时候，国内残余反革命的破坏活动还很猖狂，许多确凿的事实，说明了当时反革命分子对于我们的基本建设、工业、商业、运输业和农业，都在进行着或者计划着进行疯狂的破坏。当时人们清楚地看到：完成发展国民经济的几个五年计划，将会带给全国人民以多么巨大的幸福；但是，要容忍反革命分子的破坏，国家建设事业的顺利进行和人民的安全就会没有保证。因此，许多代表的发言，一致要求加强镇压反革命的斗争，第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议关于发展国民经济第一个五年计划的决议，也号召各级国家机关和全国人民提高警惕性，粉碎敌人对于我国人民建设事业的破坏活动。这是完全正确的，必要的，反映了广大人民的意愿的。
    各位代表，我今天应该报告给大家的，就是：我们已经这样做了，全国人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下进行了坚决的斗争，严重地打击了反革命的破坏活动，取得了很大的胜利。
    一年来的斗争，我们逮捕了一批有现行破坏活动的反革命分子，制止了一些反革命分子的重大破坏活动，还破获了许多重大的反革命案件。
    在农业合作化运动的蓬勃发展中，我们坚决打击了一批进行凶杀暗害、纵火、放毒、伤害牲畜和混入农业生产合作社内进行破坏活动的反革命分子。
    例如，河南省封丘县安上集乡后河村，反革命分子张学德，于去年10月19日夜间，手持石杵，藏身后街关帝庙旁，乘中共村支部书记郝华堂同志开会回来走在路上的时候，猛然扑打，用石杵把郝华堂同志打死，然后又跑到合作社干部申桂月同志
  （女）家中，把申桂月同志打伤。这个疯狂的杀人凶犯当场就被捕获了。
    福建省水吉县的反革命分子李堂春，在去年7月22日暗把砒霜放入农业生产合作社的面粉中，以致有社员72人中毒，毒死1人。这个反革命分子经查证确实，被依法逮捕了。
    云南省宜良县，全国人民代表大会代表张惠英同志办的农业生产合作社，是全省最早试办的九个老社之一。反革命分子段如汉钻入社里，联络了混入社内的七个反革命分子，组织了反革命集团“自卫突击组”，进行各种破坏活动。但是，在群众的帮助下，这个反革命集团被破获了，5个主犯都受到了应得的惩处。
    在伟大的社会主义建设工程中，人们一面进行着紧张的建设工作，同时也打击了反革命分子的各种破坏和捣乱。
    黑龙江省鸡西煤矿原钻探公司，有一个反革命分子吴可保，联络了技术员张殿阁、夏连清等人，组织了一个反革命破坏集团。他们在光义山一带进行地质勘测的时候，利用伪造图幅、捏造山形、乱改等高线等方法进行技术破坏，以致把地形精测图完全搞错，把高山画成平地，平地画成高山，河川画成了山顶，山顶画成了水沟。使二年勘测成果全部报废，不但给国家造成了8万元的损失，而且严重地影响了矿山的建设进度。经过技术鉴定，经过公安机关的周密侦察，这个反革命集团在去年8月间破案。
    我们的工矿企业，正在掀起热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛，争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划，我们在劳动竞赛中也不得不警惕和战胜反革命分子的破坏，因为反革命分子是非常不喜欢我们提前和超额完成经济计划的。
    例如，1955年沈阳“724”厂开展竞赛的时候，忽然发生了第七车间加工的九万个重要部件全部没有被验收的“事故”，这对于正在热烈竞赛中的工人和工厂是一个多么沉重的事情！经过仔细的调查、侦察和技术鉴定，发现验收技术员王志是一个反革命分子，他已经进行过一次破坏，这一次他又故意把大批合格产品当成不合格产品，拒绝验收，打击工人阶级的积极性，企图破坏工厂的劳动竞赛。这个反革命分子被及时地揭发出来了，“724”厂的劳动竞赛，更加热烈地展开了。
    在交通运输业中，例如反革命分子钟显亭，是大连港务局万能装卸机的司机，他利用职务，前后三次进行破坏。最后一次，故意把万能装卸机左侧机腿与泵床相连接的重要轴销弄掉，企图使机器倒落，破坏装卸任务，制造人身伤亡事故，幸而为接班人及时察觉揭发，制止了这一重大破坏阴谋。经调查证实后，这个反革命分子已被依法逮捕惩办。
    在财金贸易部门中，例如对外贸易部机械进口公司的一个反革命分子侯次功，乘去年第一机械工业部所属重庆机床厂向国外订购“齿轮偏心检查仪”的时候，故意将订货单仪器型号写错；向国外订购“标准块附件”的时候，侯犯又擅自更改品名、型号，以致造成错订商品的事故。类似这样蓄意制造的破坏事故，经过调查证实的即有七起之多，都是侯次功一人干的，以致影响了用货部门的需要，给国家造成了严重损失。这个反革命分子，已经在去年11月被依法逮捕。
    此外，在手工业合作化和资本主义工商业的公私合营等方面，也同反革命的破坏活动进行了胜利的斗争，取得了成绩。
    一年来的斗争，严重地打击了一切暗藏的反革命分子，尽管他们伪装和躲藏得多么巧妙，逃避了多次的打击，在这次镇压反革命的斗争中，终于把他们揭发出来了。
    例如，在云南省捕获了著名的反革命分子孔荷宠，陕西省捕获了曾经杀害30余名革命干部和战士，号称马步青“三大金刚”之一的李邦彦，湖南捕获了在叛变后曾经帮助敌人逮捕过大批共产党员和革命群众的大反革命分子袁文成。这几个重要的反革命分子，他们不仅历史上有滔天罪行，而且潜伏下来继续进行反革命罪恶活动。
    在这次镇压反革命斗争中，天津破获了潜藏多年的国民党“国防部二厅288组”的特务组织，捕获了30多名特务分子，缴获了潜伏电台和手枪。这个特务组织的成员，解放后，千方百计地暗藏起来，有一个特务混进了中国百货公司当了人事干部，混入了共产党；另一个特务混入了天津四友小学当了教导主任，混入青年团当了支部书记。他们巧妙地潜伏了好几年，终于在这次被捕获了。
    在这次镇压反革命斗争中，全国各地从地洞、暗室中，捕获的反动会道门的“皇帝”，就有27个。其中有些竟然身穿龙袍，准备“登基”。
    在这次镇压反革命斗争中，全国还破获了一批帝国主义和蒋介石集团派遣进来、潜伏下来的特务案件。例如，今年5月10日，在山东省海阳县董家庄，破获了美国“中央情报局”在东京的间谍组织所派遣的偷渡特务案件，特务分子李天庆、吴伯钧、袁阿木等全部落网，并缴获了无声手枪、特工照相机和各种联络器具。紧接着又在6月6日捕获了美国特务机关派来的一只小船，这只船要把上述三名特务接回去，但是敌人的如意算盘并没有达到目的，这只船上的三名特务，一名被活捉，一名被当场击毙了，另一名特务跳海自杀了。
    又如，今年3月21日武汉市捕获了蒋介石“国防部二厅”派入的特务分子焦志彬，这个特务分子已将特工电台架设好了，正当他打算向台湾特务机关拍发电报的时候，被我公安机关当场逮捕了。
    一年来的斗争，还从我们的国家机关内、从共产党和各民主党派内，从各人民团体和人民解放军内，以及从知识分子的队伍中，清查出一批暗藏的反革命分子和其他坏分子。毫无疑义，把这批反革命分子和其他坏分子，从我们国家的领导机构中或要害部门内清查出来，加以严肃而又适当的处理，这对于巩固我们的国家，保证我国社会主义建设的胜利，有着很重要的意义。
    镇压反革命斗争的胜利，就使得国内残余的反革命势力进一步地削弱下来了，就在实际上保证了我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。并且通过这场斗争，进一步提高了全国人民的革命警惕性，为彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子的斗争创造了有利的形势。
    必须强调党和政府对于公安机关的密切领导和严格监督
    镇压反革命斗争取得了很大胜利的这个事实，说明了我们的斗争进行得是健康的、正常的，在斗争中贯彻执行党和国家的政策是坚决的、正确的。
    但是，是不是说，我们在斗争中就没有缺点和错误了呢？不是的。我们的斗争是发生过一些缺点和错误的。这就是：在斗争中，一方面对于反革命的破坏还未能完全加以制止，有些重要的反革命案件还未能适时破案，还漏掉了一些反革命；另一方面又捕了少数可捕可不捕的分子，甚至错捕了个别完全不应该捕的人。在各机关内部肃清反革命分子的斗争中，在有的单位，曾经有一个很短的时期，发生过斗争面偏宽的现象，斗争了少数可以不斗的人，甚至错斗了个别完全不应该斗的人。
    这些缺点和错误的性质，是局部的，暂时的，按照我们的法制是有很多途径可以纠正的，同时也是比较容易纠正的，有些已经纠正了，有些正在纠正中。如果以为有了这些缺点和错误便否定了镇压反革命斗争的胜利，认为一切都错了，甚至把镇压反革命斗争也看作是不必要的了，这样的看法是不对的。
    但是，如果以为镇压反革命斗争取得了胜利，便不愿意检查我们工作中的缺点和错误，或者不重视我们的缺点和错误所产生的不良影响，以为不必采取老实和认真的态度去正视和纠正自己的缺点和错误，这样的看法，也是不对的。
    所以发生上述的缺点和错误，一方面，是由于我们公安机关同反革命分子作斗争的能力还不够坚强，警惕性还不高，经常出现麻痹大意，因而给予了反革命分子进行破坏活动的空隙；另一方面，是由于我们有些工作人员政治经验和社会知识不足，他们在掌握党和国家对待反革命分子的政策界限的时候，还不是完全清楚的，再加上调查研究不够，分析不够，因此，就把少数人的问题搞重了，甚至把个别人搞错了。但是，发生这些错误的主要责任在公安领导机关。我们在向下级公安机关，特别是向基层公安机关交代政策界限的时候，往往交代得不够清楚；对实际工作的领导和检查不够深入；在斗争过程中，对一些重要问题的解决不够及时。所有这些，是我们应该引为教训，并在今后工作中切实加以改进的。
    各位代表！同反革命分子作斗争，是一场严重的复杂的斗争，公安机关是掌管这个斗争的专门机关之一，担负着严重的复杂的任务。为着要在这个斗争中取得胜利，又不致发生大的危险和错误，即使发生某些缺点和错误，也能够及时发觉，容易纠正，中共中央和毛主席，根据我们历来的斗争经验，曾经为我们的公安工作规定了一些必须遵守的原则。这些原则就是：必须强调党和政府对于公安机关的密切领导和严格监督，这是有决定意义的关键；必须强调动员和依靠广大群众，并且接受广大群众的监督，反对脱离群众的孤立主义和神秘主义；在斗争方法上，必须绝对禁止刑讯逼供；必须做好调查研究工作，重证据，不轻信口供；必须认真分清案情的是非轻重，分别对待，严格限制逮捕的范围，只捕那些依法非捕不可的分子，凡是可捕可不捕的一概不捕；在侦讯过程中证实了工作中的错误，必须及时坚决地纠正；必须强调国家法律的监督，特别是国家宪法和几个重要法律颁布后，必须建立检察、法院和公安机关三者之间的密切配合和互相制约的正确关系，强调严格守法，按照法律办事。这些就是镇压反革命斗争正确进行的必不可少的重要保证。在斗争中我们一般地是严格遵守了这些原则的，所以取得了胜利，并且没有发生重大的难于纠正的错误。但是，我们还不是已经做得尽善尽美了，还有一些缺点。因此，我们必须努力在今后工作中完全遵守这些原则。只有这样，才能更完满地达到“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子”，“防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”这样两个方面的目的。
    残余反革命势力中分化动摇的趋势愈加显著
    一年来镇压反革命斗争的结果，使残余反革命分子的力量，进一步削弱下来了，反革命分子的数量比之过去更加减少了，全国城市和农村的社会治安更加安定了。少数坚决的反革命分子更加被孤立起来，在残余反革命分子的阵营中出现了进一步分化、瓦解的新情况。
    1955年下半年开始，残余反革命势力中分化动摇的趋势，愈来愈加显著。到现在，全国已有相当数量的反革命分子向人民政府投案自首。其中有躲藏了六、七年的反革命分子，从地洞、夹墙里钻出来自首的；有历史上作恶很大，血债累累的反革命分子，以前多方逃窜，到处隐藏，最近自动投案的；有从台湾、香港被帝国主义和蒋介石特务机关派遣进来的特务间谍分子，进来不久，就向人民公安机关自首的。暗藏在我们内部的反革命分子，最近也有一些出来交代自己的问题，要求从宽处理的。这种情况，还在发展。最近报纸上已经陆续报导了这个方面的一些消息，我就不再举例了。
    反革命分子中动摇分化的情况，值得我们很大的注意。这不是一个偶然的现象，而是同我国政治，经济情况发生了根本变化的这个事实密切相关联的。
    去冬今春，我国农业、手工业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造的伟大胜利，大大提高了我国人民的政治觉悟和组织程度，这个中国历史上空前未有的大变化，就使得反革命赖以生存的社会基础，大大地削弱了，反革命分子可以利用进行活动的空隙，也大大地减少了。这种巨大的变化，对反革命分子不能不发生深刻的影响。同时，我国社会主义建设事业的成就，粉碎了一切反革命的幻想和欺骗。现在，只要不是政治瞎子，只要不是十分顽固的反革命分子，都能清楚地看到中国人民的光明灿烂的前途。一切曾经对蒋介石还抱有一点什么“希望”的人，亲眼看到这个大变化之后，难道他们现在不是由抱有一点什么“希望”而变成完全绝望了吗？因此，残余的反革命势力中，有不少人要重新考虑他们的前途，改变他们同人民作对的态度，是完全可以理解的。
    应该指出：人民政府对待反革命分子的政策，特别是农业发展纲要草案的第五条的规定，进一步明确而又具体地给一切动摇徘徊的反革命分子指出了出路，对于促进反革命分子的分化瓦解，起了巨大的作用。
  按照国家的政策正确对待和处理投案自首的一切反革命分子
    我们应该十分注意残余反革命分子中这种分化瓦解的趋势，按照国家的政策，即“坦白从宽，抗拒从严，立功折罪，立大功受奖”的政策，正确对待和处理向人民政府投案自首的一切反革命分子。
    执行“坦白从宽，抗拒从严，立功折罪，立大功受奖”的政策，这就是说：
    凡是只有一般历史罪行，并无现行破坏活动的反革命分子，只要他们坦白交代，人民政府就不再向他们追究罪责，并尽量安置他们的工作，给以生活出路。
    凡是有严重历史罪行，有血债，有民愤的反革命分子，只要他们坦白交代，不再作恶，也可以依法从宽处理；即使罪行最严重的，只要坦白交代，我们的人民法院也可以依法免处重刑。
    凡是至今尚与帝国主义、蒋介石集团的特务机关保持联系、进行现行破坏活动的反革命分子和特务间谍分子，只要他们同敌人割断联系，真心悔改，老老实实地交代清楚自己的罪恶，也可以依法从宽处理；罪行最严重的，我们的人民法院也可以依法免处重刑。
    一切反革命分子，不仅自己坦白交代，而且检举了其他反革命分子，经查证确实的，就算立功。立了功的可以折罪，以至免予刑事处分。协助政府破获了重要案件，捕获了重要反革命分子，就算立大功。立了大功的不仅可以折罪，而且要受到奖励。当然，别有用心诬告陷害好人的，一经查明，就要受到法律惩办。
    上面所说的这些明确的政策，实际上我们已经在这样做。
    譬如说：最近各地都从宽处理了一批反革命分子，其中也有罪恶十分严重的反革命分子。有些罪恶十分严重，但立有大功的反革命分子，不仅免予刑事处分，而且还获得了政府的奖励。
    在农村，根据农业发展纲要草案第五条的规定，按照反革命分子的不同情况，除极少数罪恶重、民愤大和进行破坏活动的分子须依法加以逮捕外，其余的一般分子，都把他们放入合作社作为正式社员，候补社员，或管制生产，进行改造。对于管制生产的分子，也给他们同工同酬的待遇。1956年内，全国绝大多数地方就要实行这个规定，最近，全国有一些地方已经这样实行了，有一批原来的反革命分子已经加入了农业生产合作社。
    例如，河南省4，028个乡的统计：绝大多数的原来的反革命分子加入了合作社。其中有14.7％摘掉了反革命帽子成为正式社员，有56.1％成为候补社员，有29.2％交合作社管制生产。
    又如，广东省2，701个乡的统计：绝大多数的原来的反革命分子也已经加入了合作社。其中有12.7％摘掉了反革命帽子成为正式社员，有50.6％成为候补社员，有36.7％交合作社管制生产。
    参加了合作社的原来的反革命分子，现在是候补社员的，经过一个时期的劳动和教育，表现好的，可以转为正式社员；现在是管制生产的，同样也可以转为候补社员或正式社员。
    在城市，对于一般反革命分子也应该根据上述精神，适当地安置工作，给予生活出路。其原则是：对于一切从宽处理和被管制的分子，以及刑满释放的分子，已有固定职业的，按原来行业予以安置。没有职业、或者没有固定职业又没有生活依靠的分子，按照具体情节，分别送回农村参加生产，或者组织移民生产，或者组织就地劳动就业，并且对就业分子实行同工同酬。已经丧失劳动条件而生活又无依靠的，予以收容教养。有些城市，例如北京市，已经这样做了，取得了很好的效果。有一批原来的反革命分子已经被分别介绍到各个工作岗位劳动就业了，他们十分感激人民政府的措施。全国有些地方，例如南京、上海，正在准备这样做，其他各地，也都要逐渐按照上述原则去做。
    我们相信，已经参加了合作社和已经安置就业了的原来的反革命分子，只要他们积极劳动，力求进步，努力改造自己，他们一定会有光明幸福的前途的。一切正在准备加入合作社和即将安置就业的原来的反革命分子，只要他们也这样做，我们相信，他们也会获得同样光明的前途的。
    对于反革命分子的家属，人民政府的政策，历来是：只要他们没有参与反革命活动，就应该同一般公民有同等就业和加入合作社的权利，不应该受到歧视。至于他们的青年子女，本来就和一般青年一样有同等的求学就业和加入合作社的权利，更不应该受到任何的歧视。
    对于上述这些明确的政策，也有实行得不好的地方，凡是这样的地方，都必须认真检查，加以改正。
    我们这样做，是因为我国的情况已经有了根本的变化，我们的斗争，就必须从这种已经变化了的实际情况出发。我们这样做，是符合我国社会主义事业的利益的，是符合广大人民的利益的。我们需要有更多的人来参加祖国的社会主义建设，我们也完全有可能把残余反革命势力中的大多数分子，通过劳动生产和政治教育的方法把他们改造过来。我们希望一切还站在祖国社会主义事业外面的，过去起消极作用、起破坏作用的人，今天都能够下定决心，走到正确的、光明的道路上来，发挥积极作用。我们这样做，对于反革命分子本人，就是把他们从罪恶的深渊中挽救了出来，给他们重新做人的机会。我们从来都是希望反革命分子回心向善，抛弃反革命立场，成为新社会有用的人。现在，我们更有理由要求他们早下决心，赶快向人民政府交代自己的罪恶，跟随全国人民一道，建设伟大的社会主义社会。
    以上是对那些愿意悔改、愿意抛弃反革命立场的分子说的，那些宽大处理的原则，也只能适用于他们。对于那些现在还在进行破坏活动的坚决的反革命分子，特别是那些经过宽大处理后又进行破坏活动的分子，对于这样的分子，我们除了采取坚决地打击他们这样一个办法之外，不可能采取任何别的办法来对待他们。因为道理很清楚，如果不这样办，我们就要犯错误。而我们犯错误的结果，就会直接危害国家的社会主义事业。
  革命同反革命的斗争，目前依然是尖锐的复杂的，我们一定要同反革命分子斗争到底
    那么，现在还有没有这样的反革命分子呢？还有没有反革命活动呢？
    在农业合作化胜利之后，农村中的反革命活动虽然大大减少了，但是并没有完全消灭。就在最近时期，在几个地区仍然发生了反革命的阴谋暴动和凶杀暗害的事件。例如，今年3月24日晚上，河北省栾城县沿村，反动“还乡道”的匪徒就杀死在该村工作的科长级干部一人，杀伤县工作组干部一人，乡村干部三人和农民二人。
    地主、富农、反革命分子加入了农业生产合作社，多数表现是好的。但是也有少数分子，进了合作社还搞破坏。今年4月安徽省郎溪县水鸣乡放入社内管制生产的地主分子杨文森，因为社员杨春才检举了他的罪恶，他就把杨春才杀死了。
    在厂矿企业，交通运输，财金贸易等系统中，反革命分子制造破坏事故，危害生产建设的活动，目前也还有发现。
    我们还不能忘记，国外还有帝国主义包围着我们，国内还有蒋介石集团盘踞在台湾，他们也还没有放松对我们的破坏。今年以来，帝国主义和蒋介石特务机关派遣进来的特务，大有增加。广州一市2月到4月的3个月中，发现派遣进来的特务间谍就比去年全年增加了将近一倍。今年5月1日夜间，广东深圳以北二公里处的铁道，被蒋介石特务机关从香港派进来的行动特务刘立，用烈性炸药炸毁了一根路轨，一根枕木。这个特务已被捕获。最近不少地方，特务间谍的活动也有一些增长。
    这些事实，说明了反革命分子虽然确实是减少了，但是也确实还有，还在活动。而且，残余的一部分坚决的反革命分子越打越精，他们的破坏手段往往更加狡猾，更加毒辣了。因此，革命同反革命的斗争，目前依然是尖锐的、复杂的。在全国和全世界还存在着阶级和阶级斗争的整个历史时期内，反革命总还是有的，革命同反革命的斗争总还是存在着的。如果我们忽视这个客观事实，因为已经取得的胜利而麻痹自满起来，那就是十分有害的了。
    目前全国还有继续开展镇压反革命和肃清内部暗藏反革命斗争的任务，我们还必须继续努力，务必不要松劲。一方面要贯彻执行我们的正确政策，争取更多的反革命分子坦白交代，投案自首；另一方面还要积极地开展群众性的和专门机关的共同斗争，给一切敢于进行反革命破坏活动的分子，以坚决的打击。
    我们要遵照周总理在关于知识分子问题报告中的指示，争取在今、明两年内胜利结束社会上的和国家机关内部的镇压反革命分子的运动。当然，就是镇压反革命运动结束了，也还并不等于就没有镇压反革命的斗争了。只要还有反革命分子存在，还有反革命破坏活动，为了保卫社会主义的伟大事业，为了保卫国家和人民的安全，我们是一定要同反革命分子斗争到底的！不把反革命分子肃清得干干净净，我们全国人民是绝不罢手的！
