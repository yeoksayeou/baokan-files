Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. The Hiqin Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, which created comprehensive planning experience for agricultural cooperation, has recently implemented the Party's policy of guaranteeing increased production and increased income for agricultural cooperatives by mobilizing members to calculate three accounts: production increase, expenditures, and income, greatly inspiring members' labor enthusiasm and cooperative-building initiative.

Before calculating the three accounts, most of the members of the Hiqin Village Agricultural Cooperative were full of enthusiasm. They said that since the establishment of the advanced cooperative this year, production has been better than any previous year, and the grain harvest will definitely be high, so the dividends will not be small. However, they had no idea whether their income could actually increase, or by how much. Another group of members had concerns, believing that the advanced cooperative had only been established recently, had a weak foundation, high expenses, and high labor costs, so even if production increased, it might not be possible to distribute much more. Some middle peasant members said, "You can't see the autumn from the spring, you can only tell the difference after harvesting the grain." Some poor peasant members worried because they had weak labor and large families, saying, "I earn few workdays, and after all the deductions in the autumn, I won't get much."

After calculating the production increase account, the members felt that the spring plowing production increase measures had been well implemented this year, and 91% of the cultivated land had been fertilized. Wheat, soybeans, sorghum, and flax crops were all sown with new farm tools. The area of high-yield crops and intercropping has greatly increased compared to previous years. More than thirty wells were dug this year, which had never been done before, irrigating dozens of hectares of land. Everyone watched the seedlings grow strong and uniformly, and said with smiles that based on the current foundation, if we do a good job in summer hoeing, and if no major natural disasters occur, it is entirely possible to achieve the cooperative's plan to harvest 5,000 catties of grain per hectare.

When calculating the expenditure account, everyone was satisfied with the cooperative's implementation of the principle of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. After research, the cooperative decided to remove the planned expansions of the nurseries, clubs, and offices from the original plan. The number of full-time cadres was reduced from seven to four. The work points and subsidies for the captains and bookkeepers, which were originally too high, were also reduced by half. In this way, the work points and subsidies for full-time and part-time cadres will not exceed 2% of the total workdays of the cooperative. All non-production labor is not recorded as work.

In order to make income more secure, the income account was calculated based on a yield of 4,400 catties of grain per hectare. In this way, after deducting agricultural tax, production investment, management fees, and public accumulation from the total income, it can still be guaranteed that 67% of the net income is distributed to the members. Of the 373 cooperative member households, except for one upper-middle peasant household whose income is the same as last year, and one new rich peasant household whose income is slightly lower than last year, the income of the remaining members can increase to varying degrees compared to last year, with the largest increase being threefold.

After this calculation, all the members, especially the middle peasant members, were more confident about increasing production and income. The members' enthusiasm was universally high, and they all said, "This time the goal is clearer, whether we can achieve it depends on our hard work in the future!" At present, the male and female members of this cooperative are all starting early and working late to carry out summer hoeing. Each member has also submitted a plan through labor to ensure an increase in personal income.

The Shuangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the Hiqin Village Agricultural Cooperative's experience in mobilizing members to calculate the three accounts is a good way to specifically implement the Party's policy of guaranteeing increased production and increased income for agricultural cooperatives, turning the Party's policies into the demands and actions of the masses, and enabling the masses to further exert their initiative and creativity. Therefore, this experience is now being widely promoted throughout the county.

    希勤村农业合作社贯彻执行增产增收政策
    发动社员算增产、开支、收入三笔账
    大大鼓舞了社员的劳动热情和积极性
    新华社哈尔滨7日电　创造农业合作化全面规划经验的黑龙江省双城县希勤村农业生产合作社，最近通过发动社员算增产、开支和收入三笔账的办法，具体地贯彻党的保证农业社增加生产和增加社员收入的政策，大大鼓舞了社员的劳动热情和办社积极性。
    希勤村农业社在没算三笔账以前，大部分社员的思想情绪是饱满的。他们说，今年成立高级社后，生产比那一年都搞得好，粮食一定能打得多，分红不会少。但是他们对于到底能否增加收入，增加多少的问题，却心中无数。另一部分社员有顾虑，认为高级社建立不久，底子薄，花费大，用工多，就是能增产，也不一定能多分。有的中农社员说：“隔春望不到秋，打粮食才能看出上下。”有的贫农社员因为家里劳力弱，人口多，所以忧虑地说：“干的劳动日少，到秋七折八扣，就分不到多少了。”
    算了增产账以后，社员们都感到今年春耕增产措施执行得好，91％的耕地都施了肥。小麦、大豆、高粱、亚麻四种作物全部是用新式农具播种的。高产作物和混作面积都比往年大大增加。历来没有打过井，今年打了三十多眼，使几十公顷土地得到了灌溉。大伙看到小苗长得又壮又齐，都笑咪咪地说，凭现在这个底，把夏锄再搞好，要不发生什么大的自然灾害，实现全社每公顷打五千斤粮的计划是完全可能的。
    在算开支账的时候，大伙对社里执行勤俭办社的方针是满意的。经过研究，社里又决定把可以缓办的扩建托儿所、俱乐部和办公室等，都从原计划中削去。脱产干部由七名减到四名。原来标准过高的队长和记账员的工分、补贴也降低了一半。这样脱产和半脱产干部的工分、补贴就不超过全社总劳动日的2％了。非生产用工一律不记工。
    为了使收入更有把握，收入账按每公顷打四千四百斤粮计算。这样，总收入去掉农业税、生产投资、管理费和公共积累等，还能够保证有67％的纯收入分配给社员，全社373户社员，除了一户上中农收入和去年相同，一户新富农收入比去年有所降低以外，其余社员的收入都可以比去年有不同程度的增加，最多的可以增加三倍。
    经过这样一算，全体社员特别是中农社员对增产增收更加托底了。社员情绪普遍高涨，都这样说，这回目标更明确了，能不能实现就靠咱们往后使劲干啦！目前，这个社的男女社员都起早贪黑地紧张进行夏锄。每个社员并且通过劳动自报，订出了保证个人收入增加的计划。
    中共双城县委员会认为，希勤村农业社这种发动社员算三笔账的经验，是具体地贯彻党的保证农业社增加生产和增加收入的政策的好办法，把党的政策变成群众的要求和行动，使群众能够进一步发挥积极性和创造性。因此，现在全县正在普遍推广这一经验。
