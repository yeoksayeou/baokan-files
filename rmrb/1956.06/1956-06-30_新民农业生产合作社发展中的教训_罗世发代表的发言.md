Now, allow me to report to the conference on the situation of the Xinmin Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heden Township, Xinfan County, Sichuan.

The Xinmin Cooperative was established in the autumn of 1952, initially with only 15 households. By the spring of 1954, it had expanded to 168 households, encompassing the vast majority of farmers in the village. Last winter, as the high tide of the agricultural collectivization movement swept across the country, Xinmin Cooperative discussed a merger with six other nearby cooperatives, transforming into an advanced cooperative of 738 households on New Year's Day this year.

The rapid development of the Xinmin Cooperative is inseparable from its consecutive years of increased production. Xinfan is a plain area, mainly producing grain. Taking the increased production of rice as an example, the average yield per mu in 1954 was 568.5 jin, and in 1955 it increased by 10.74%, reaching over 629 jin per mu. Due to the continuous growth in production, the income of cooperative members also increased year by year. Especially in 1955, due to reducing the area of sweet potato fields and planting more than 200 mu of potatoes, a bumper harvest was achieved. The average agricultural income per household increased from over 330 yuan in 1954 to 444 yuan.

As income constantly increased, the lives of cooperative members also gradually improved. Tang Xingfa, a cooperative member, had been a hired worker for more than ten years. Before joining the cooperative, his family of six did not even have spare quilts or mosquito nets. Tang Xingfa himself only had a linen sack, regardless of the season, which he used as a quilt in winter and a mosquito net in summer. On snowy days, when it was cold, he would drape it over his back as a coat. However, after the autumn harvest last year, Tang Xingfa had already prepared two sets of quilts and mosquito nets, and his whole family was warmly dressed in cotton-padded clothes. Of course, Tang Xingfa was not the only one like this. Their specific examples educated the surrounding farmers, making everyone realize that only by taking the path of collectivization can they completely escape poverty.

As you can imagine, the development of the Xinmin Cooperative was not smooth sailing. We also encountered many obstacles and made many mistakes in these past few years. Last spring, because of a lack of feed, the cooperative members requested a solution, but we used all the feed on 125 boars and ignored the others. As a result, many cooperative members took their pigs to sell, leading to a fertilizer shortage in the spring and affecting the sideline income of the cooperative members. It was not until the higher-level Party committee inspected and discovered the mistake that we realized we were wrong. This kind of mistake of one-sidedly emphasizing the collective interests of the cooperative without considering the personal interests of the cooperative members was also reflected in the treatment of cooperative members' sideline occupations of raising chickens and ducks. Because the chickens and ducks damaged the crops and could not be controlled, we allowed some activists to randomly hit them with stones and earth, without even criticizing them when they were killed. Later, the cooperative members reflected: It sounds good, but it's a sin to do! After joining the cooperative, you can't even pick up a few eggs or tear a piece of cloth for shoe uppers!

From the experiences and lessons learned by the Xinmin Cooperative over the past few years, in order to increase grain production, we must continuously promote advanced experiences and change the farming system. Problems cannot be solved without jumping out of the confines of small-scale peasant economy. But for the average farmer, this is a struggle. The process of planting potatoes in 1955 could fill a book if described in detail. Because the cooperative members all believed that potatoes only grow well in the mountains, and planting potatoes in the plains was an unprecedented strange occurrence. Everyone was also very opposed to the use of new agricultural tools at the beginning. In the spring of the year before last, we happily bought a double-wheeled single-blade plow, but encountered many obstacles. Zeng Yuqing, a female new-style agricultural tool operator, suffered a lot of ridicule and attacks. The cattle feeders refused to hand over the cattle. Some closed the water in the fields, making it impossible for you to plow. And as soon as they met you, they would say strange things: Even the nuns have ascended the Dharma throne, we should stay at home and take care of the children!

Some of the situations I mentioned above are already in the past. Now I want to talk about some new situations and new problems after the Xinmin Cooperative developed into an advanced cooperative of 738 households. It should be said that, encouraged by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members is very high. Especially after the 12-year long-term plan, everyone is very motivated. But because our ability is limited, especially myself, I lack experience and was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the masses, and I did not handle some major issues well. First of all, the issue of combining agriculture and sideline occupations was not handled well. It is certainly wrong to not pay attention to sideline occupations; but after switching to an advanced cooperative, we engaged in more sideline occupations. In addition to the hydropower station, rice mill, and two flour mills, we also built 6 brick and tile kilns, taking up more than 110 young and middle-aged cooperative members! A cooperative with only 1,245 full laborers, having so many people tied up in sideline occupations year-round will affect agricultural production. But not only did we not consider this beforehand, but at the same time, when planting the major spring crops, we uniformly promoted dense planting and transplanting seedlings, which delayed the planting of more than 400 mu of rice by a season. Because dense planting and transplanting seedlings required more labor, last year one person could plant two mu a day, but this year one person could only plant seven or eight fen a day at most. Moreover, in order to rush to plant and transplant, we also made indiscriminate calls: Light the lamp to eat, go to the field when it's light, speed up, and complete the task within the time limit! Thinking that this would encourage everyone to work harder, so as not to miss the season and affect the production increase plan; as a result, the task was completed, but the cooperative members had opinions.

After the Xinmin Cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative, we also made mistakes in promoting advanced experiences. Due to the bumper harvest of more than 200 mu of potatoes last year, we planted a total of 700 mu after the merger. Compared with last year, planting six or seven hundred mu out of more than 5,000 mu of fields is not considered too much. But we did not have enough seeds, and many were temporarily purchased, not meeting the specifications. This is not to mention that we also sent two people to learn the "sprouting" technology. After only studying for three days, they returned and promoted it comprehensively, resulting in uneven temperature control, and many potatoes were already dried up when they were planted, developing very poorly. Later, mosaic disease occurred, and treatment was not timely, which led to the average yield per mu of potatoes decreasing by almost a quarter compared to last year. Fortunately, the yield of our more than 2,000 mu of rapeseed and wheat was higher than last year.

In addition, we also intercropped corn in the potato fields and green manure between the rows in the rapeseed fields. We also uniformly promoted it comprehensively, thinking that one hoe could dig up a golden baby! But what was the result? The corn could only be used as cattle feed, and there was not even a trace of green manure in the rapeseed fields. Because the intercropping of corn was an afterthought, we did not reserve a certain position for the corn when planting potatoes; the sowing of green manure between the rows also did not take into account the actual situation: at that time, the land was dry, there was little rain, the rapeseed was already very deep, which was not conducive to sowing. If some of the more than two dan of rapeseed seeds scattered in the rapeseed fields could have grown into some seedlings, the cooperative members would have had fewer opinions; but there were not even any seedlings! So everyone, whether in front of or behind us, ridiculed us: Our cooperative is so rich! We can just scatter rapeseed seeds for fun!

I have already said before that we encountered opposition when promoting the double-wheeled single-blade plow; but later everyone believed in it. Because everyone saw the effect: the fields plowed by the new-style plow were deeper than those plowed by the old-style plow, and each mu yielded fifty or sixty jin more grain. But we forgot one thing this year, the new-style plow is most effective in terraced paddy fields and sweet potato fields, and is stronger than the old-style plow no matter what. After harvesting rapeseed and wheat, the soil bubbles, and there is no need to dig up the bottom. The new-style plow is not necessarily more cost-effective than the old-style plow. Because the new-style plow requires two cattle. However, because we only thought that using the new-style plow was advanced, we ignored everything, even the size of the field, and uniformly stipulated that the new-style plow should be used; those who used the old-style plow were not given work points! This led to a shortage of cattle and also caused dissatisfaction among some cooperative members.

It has only been a little over half a year since the Xinmin Cooperative merged with the other 6 cooperatives and transformed into an advanced cooperative. This cannot be said to be long, but judging from some of the situations I mentioned above, there are already quite a few shortcomings and mistakes. Some of these shortcomings and mistakes have been corrected and remedied in a timely manner. Some are being corrected. Moreover, the rapeseed and wheat crops, apart from the potatoes, were a bumper harvest in the spring, and although some of the major spring crops missed the season, we have reason and grounds to achieve a bumper harvest, increase production, and ensure that 90% of the cooperative members increase their income.

Ensuring that 90% of the cooperative members increase their income is the key to whether a cooperative can be consolidated. It is also what the Party and the government have repeatedly taught us. For several years, we have basically achieved this. But the experience of the past six months has made me feel more deeply that it is not enough to simply save non-productive expenses. We should pay special attention to labor allocation and production cost calculation. For example, even the necessary paper in our cooperative is very tight. The team asking for paper to record work points is like asking for our lives. But because we made a mistake with the inter-row green fertilizer, we lost more than two dan of rapeseed seeds at once, no wonder the cooperative members satirized us: "We can't see a bull passing by, but we can see an ant passing by."

We have made many shortcomings and mistakes in the calculation of production costs in the past. Here, I only intend to offer some opinions on the institutions that supply fertilizers and pesticides. Because they also have a responsibility in order to completely avoid wasting production costs. In some issues, the responsibility is not even less than ours. This spring, some of our sweet potato fields had sweet potato budworms, and we bought 666 powder, but this 666 powder was not very effective, and there were still many sweet potato budworms. Some cooperative members suspected that the 666 powder was not applied enough, so they caught a few worms and buried them in the powder. They took them out after the time it takes to smoke a bag of leaf tobacco: the worms were still alive. The sesame cake we bought this year was also not very useful, and some of it was moldy. In addition, there was a batch of threshing machines that could not be used for a year or two. Because each machine weighed hundreds of jin, plus the mixing bucket, it was too difficult to move.

Isn't this a waste of production costs? And if you calculate the detailed accounts, the amount is not small. So the cooperative members have some opinions on the institutions that supply fertilizers and pesticides. They said angrily, "We sell grain clean, dry, and full, even the shriveled husks are blown away by the wind. But you take away the medicines that have lost their efficacy to supply us!" These opinions are of course a bit excessive. We believe that every cadre wants to do things well. It is a pity that they did not think that they had sold the outdated fertilizers and pesticides, protecting their costs, but we farmers have suffered losses. I hope that the government can pay full attention to these situations and come up with solutions to change them.

Finally, I would like to say a few words: I would like to express my heartfelt support for Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget! Judging from the agricultural part of the report, we have a deeper understanding of the care of the Party and the government for us farmers. After returning from this meeting, I will definitely unite more closely with all the cooperative members and work hard with full confidence!

    新民农业生产合作社发展中的教训
    ——罗世发代表的发言
    现在，请让我向大会汇报一下四川新繁县禾登乡新民高级农业生产合作社的情况。
    新民社是1952年秋天成立的。成立时只有15户人。到了1954年春天，就扩大到168户，全村绝大多数农民都入社了。去年冬天，全国掀起了农业合作化运动的高潮，新民社就同附近其他6个合作社酝酿合并，在今年元旦变成了一个738户的高级社。
    新民社能够发展得这么快，这是同它连年的增产分不开的。新繁是平坝区，以生产粮食为主。单拿水稻增产说吧，1954年每亩平均产量是568斤半，1955年就增长了10.74％，达到了每亩629斤多。因为产量不断增长，社员的收入也一年比一年多了。特别是1955年，因为缩小苕田面积，种了200多亩洋芋，又获得了丰收，平均每户的农业收入，也由1954年每户的330余元增加到平均每户444元。
    因为收入的不断增加，社员的生活也逐步提高了。社员唐兴发当过十多年雇工，未入社前，一家六口，就是破棉絮破帐子都没有多余的，唐兴发自己，不管寒暑，只有一只麻布口袋，冬天当被盖，夏天当帐子。碰到下雪天冷，就搭在背上，当大衣穿。可是去年秋收以后，唐兴发却已制备了两套被盖帐子，全家人穿得棉滚滚的。这样的人当然不止唐兴发一个，正是他们的具体事例教育了周围的农民，使大家认识到只有走合作化的道路才能彻底摆脱贫困。
    大家可以猜想得到，新民社的发展，并不是一帆风顺的，在这几年当中，我们也碰过不少钉子，犯过不少错误。去年春天，因为缺乏饲料，社员要求解决，我们却把所有饲料用在125只公猪身上，其他我们就不管了。结果不少社员把猪牵去卖了，弄得大春缺肥，还影响到社员副业收入。直到上级党委检查出来，才知道弄错了。这样片面强调社的集体利益，不考虑社员个人利益的错误，还表现在对待社员养鸡养鸭的副业上。因为鸡鸭糟害庄稼，照管不住，我们就听任一些积极分子用石头土块乱打，打死了也不批评。后来社员反映：真是说得安逸，整得造孽！入了社，想捡几个蛋扯点鞋面布都不行了！
    从新民社这几年得到的经验教训说，要想提高粮食产量，只有不断推广先进经验，改变耕作制度。不跳出小农经济的圈子，问题是没办法解决的。可是对于一般农民说来，这是一场斗争。1955年栽种洋芋的经过，详细说起来可以写一本书。因为社员都认为洋芋只有山上肯长，洋芋下坝是“盘古王开天以来”没有过的怪事。使用新式农具，大家开始也很反对。前年春天，我们高高兴兴买了双轮单铧犁回来，结果碰到不少阻碍。女新式农具手曾玉清受了多少讽刺和打击啊。喂牛户不把牛交出来。有的在田里关了水，使你无法耕地。而且一见面就说怪话：尼姑都坐了法台，我们该留在家里领娃儿了！
  上面谈到的一些情况，早已经过去了，现在我想谈谈新民社发展成738户的高级社以后的一些新的情况，新的问题。应当说，在党中央和毛主席的鼓舞下，社员们的生产积极性是很高的。特别经过12年远景规划以后，大家劲头很大。可是由于我们能力有限，特别是我自己缺乏锻炼，被群众的热情冲昏了头脑，在一些重大问题上处理得很不好。首先是农、副业结合的问题没有处理好。不重视副业，当然是不对的；但在转入高级社后，我们的副业搞得多了一些。除开水电站，辗米厂，两个粉房，我们还搞了6个砖瓦窑，一共占去110多个青壮年社员！一个一共只有1，245个全劳动力的社，在副业上一下就长年陷进去这么多人，这是会影响到农业生产的。可是我们事先不光是没有考虑到这一点，同时在栽种大春上，又一律推行密植铲秧，这一来使得400多亩水稻的栽插推迟了一个季节。因为密植铲秧费的人工较多，去年一个人一天可栽二亩，今年一个人一天栽七、八分就顶了天了。而且，为了抢插抢栽，我们还胡乱提出号召：点亮吃饭，见亮下田，快马加鞭，限期完工！以为这样可以鼓动起大家加把劲干，不致错过季节，影响增产计划；结果任务倒完成了，社员都有意见。
    新民社转为高级社后，在推广先进经验方面，我们也犯过错误。由于去年200多亩洋芋的丰收，并社以后我们就一共种植了700亩。跟去年比，5，000多亩田种个六、七百亩，是不能算多的。可是我们没有足够的种子，好多都是临时收购来的，不合规格。这还不说，我们又派了两个人去学习“催芽”的技术。只学习了三天，就回来全面推广，结果温度掌握不一，不少洋芋下种时候就已经干了浆了，发育得很不好。后来发生了宛约病，又救治不及时，这就使得每亩洋芋的平均产量几乎比去年减产四分之一，好在我们两千多亩油菜和小麦的产量都比去年的高。
    此外，我们又在洋芋田里间种玉麦，油菜田里搞行间绿肥。也是一律全面推广，以为一锄头就可以挖一个金娃娃！可是结果呢，玉麦只能作牛饲料，油菜田里的行间绿肥，连影子也没有。因为间种玉麦是临时想起的，栽洋芋的时候没有给玉麦预留一定位置；播种行间绿肥也没有考虑到实际情况：当时土地干燥，雨水又少，油菜已经很深，对播种都不利。如果撒在油菜田里的那两石多菜籽能够有一部分长出点苗苗，社员的意见是会少一点的；可是连一点苗苗都没有！所以大家不管当面背后，都讽刺我们：我们这个社才肥实哩！随便拿菜籽撒倒玩！
    前面我已经说过，在推广双轮单铧犁的时候，我们遭到过反对；可是后来大家都相信了。因为效果大家都看见的：新式犁抄的田比旧式犁抄的田深，一亩要多收五、六十斤谷子。但是我们今年忘记了一件事，谷板田、苕板田，使用新式犁最带劲，无论如何比旧式犁强。收了菜籽、小麦的田，土泡，用不上揭底子，用新式犁就不一定比旧式犁合算。因为新式犁要占用两头牛。可是，因为我们单是想到使用新式犁才先进，就不管一切，甚至不管田的大小，一律规定用新式犁；用旧式犁的，不给工分！这一来弄得牛不够用，也引起一部分社员表示不满。
    新民社同其他6个社合并，又转为高级社，到现在才不过半年多时间。这不能说长，可是单以我上面说的一些情况来看，缺点错误已经不算少了。这些缺点错误，有的已经及时作了纠正，进行了补救。有的正在进行纠正。而且，小春除洋芋外，油菜小麦是丰收了的，一部分大春尽管错过了季节，我们也有理由有根据获得丰收，增加产量，保证90％的社员增加收入。
    保证90％的社员增加收入，这是一个合作社能不能够巩固下来的关键。也是党和政府再三向我们教导过的。几年以来，我们基本上算做到了这一点。可是近半年的经历，使我更加深刻地感觉到，要做到这一点，单是节省非生产性的开支，是很不够的，应该特别注意劳力调配和生产成本计算。比如说吧，我们社里就连必需的纸张，也卡得来很紧的。队上要点纸记工分正像要我们的命样。可是因为搞错了行间绿肥，一下就损失了两石多菜籽，这无怪社员讽刺我们：“牯牛过看不见，蚂蚁过倒看见了。”
    在生产成本计算上，我们过去的缺点错误是很多的，这里我只准备再对供应肥料和农药的机构提点意见。因为要完全做到不浪费生产成本，他们也有责任。在有的问题上，责任还并不比我们的小。今年春天，我们有一部分苕田生了苕芽虫，我们买了六六六粉来，可是这些六六六粉没有发生多少效力，苕芽虫还是很多。有的社员怀疑六六六粉打少了，就捉了几只虫埋在药粉里面，隔了一袋叶子烟久取出来看：虫子还是活的。今年我们买的麻枯，也不大中用，一部分发了霉。另外还有批打谷机，一两年用不上。因为每架有百十斤，加上拌桶，移动太困难了。
    这难道不是浪费生产成本吗？而且算算细账，数目是不小的。所以社员群众对供应肥料、农药的机构有些意见，他们愤愤不平地说：“我们卖粮食一干二净三饱满，连一颗瘪壳子都是风掉了的，你们可拿走了气的药供应我们！”这些意见当然有些过火，我们相信，每一个干部都想把事情办好的。只可惜他们没有想想，他们倒把过了时的肥料、农药推销掉了，保住了成本，我们农民可吃了亏了。我希望政府能够充分注意这些情况，拿出办法来加以改变。
      最后，我还想说几句：对于李先念副
  总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，我在这里表示衷心拥护！从报告中关于农业部分来看，我们更加体会到党和政府对于我们农民的关怀。这次开会
  回去，我一定要更好地同全体社员团结一致，信心百倍地努力工作！
