    I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the national budget and final accounts. Now, I will briefly present to the representatives the Ministry of Geology's implementation of the First Five-Year Plan and related issues. The backward state of geological work left over from old China has undergone profound changes in recent years; we have achieved certain successes in implementing the Five-Year Plan.
    The Ministry of Geology was established in the second half of 1952 to meet the needs of the country's planned economic construction, marking the beginning of the formal incorporation of geological work into the national plan. During the First Five-Year Plan, the Ministry of Geology's basic task was to ensure the needs of mineral raw material reserves and other geological data for major construction projects during the First Five-Year Plan, and to prepare for the geological exploration requirements of the Second Five-Year Plan. Over the past few years, we have carried out intensive work around this task. The workload has increased exponentially each year. The total amount of work done in the past four years has greatly exceeded the total amount of mineral resource exploration work in old China for nearly half a century. While the work has expanded rapidly, we have continuously adopted new technologies, improved technical equipment, and strengthened technical forces. Currently, geological exploration personnel are distributed throughout the country's provinces, undertaking the exploration of dozens of mineral raw materials. New types of work, such as geophysical prospecting and geochemical prospecting, have developed somewhat in the past four years. New technologies such as aerial surveys and radioactive surveys have begun to be used. Hydrogeological and engineering geological work has expanded from simply undertaking mine hydrogeological surveys to undertaking planning for major rivers such as the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, and surveys for huge hydro-junctions. All of this shows that the backward state of geological work left over from old China has undergone profound changes in just a few years.
    In recent years, thanks to our implementation of the central government's instructions, the care and support of the people throughout the country, and the technical assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, we have achieved certain successes in implementing the Five-Year Plan. As of now, several large iron ore, manganese ore, and coal mines have been proven, basically meeting the construction needs of several large iron and steel complexes in Wuhan, Baotou, and North China. In terms of non-ferrous metals, copper and lead-zinc mineral raw material bases have been established in Northwest, North, East, and Hunan. In addition, larger-scale iron ore deposits have been found in Gansu and Sichuan, a large lead mine has been found in Qinghai, and a considerable-scale molybdenum mine has been found in Shaanxi, which are of great significance for the industrial construction in China's hinterland. Since 1955, the Ministry of Geology has undertaken the task of petroleum reconnaissance and has worked in coordination with the Ministry of Petroleum Industry to find natural petroleum. In the past year or so, a large amount of work has been deployed in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan, North China, and Ordos, and nearly two hundred oil-bearing structures of varying sizes and widely distributed oil shows or traces have been discovered in the above-mentioned regions. Recently, crude oil and natural gas have continuously emerged or gushed from a series of exploratory wells being drilled in the Qaidam Basin. In the face of these facts, if we still stubbornly cling to the prejudices passed down from some capitalist countries and dogmatically insist that China is a country poor in oil, that is unreasonable, and it is also detrimental to our long-term plan for developing the national economy. In addition, we have cooperated with water conservancy, urban construction, and other departments to carry out hydrogeological and engineering geological work. In order to meet the needs of agricultural development for mineral fertilizers, we have proven considerable reserves of phosphate rock in Southwest and East China.
    These achievements have greatly changed the understanding of China's resource prospects, enhanced the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for socialist construction, and encouraged our confidence in completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. In particular, after the upsurge of the nationwide socialist revolution last year, the socialist construction enthusiasm of the vast majority of workers has soared to an unprecedented level, and advanced producers and advanced production records have continued to emerge. Under such a new situation, we made a leap forward when planning the work for 1956. For example, the amount of drilling work in 1956 increased by 2.7 times compared to 1955, the number of reconnaissance and exploration projects increased by 2.6 times, and from 1956, regular 1:200,000 scale geological surveys were started in several regions, and reconnaissance and inspection were carried out on hundreds of known mineralization sites to strengthen prospecting work and expand reserve production areas. After a year of intensive work this year, it is estimated that iron ore reserves can cumulatively complete 144% of the Five-Year Plan, manganese 125%, copper 102%, lead 141%, molybdenum 355%, pyrite 407%, phosphorus 316%, coal 106%, tin 95%. In addition, certain reserves of nineteen minerals not included in the Five-Year Plan, such as magnesium, nickel, chromium, asbestos, piezoelectric quartz, diamond, mica, and borax, can also be handed over. This means that the Ministry of Geology's mineral reserve targets stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, except for individual minerals, can be completed one year ahead of schedule. Of course, the targets stipulated in the plan are only the minimum requirements set by the state based on the current production level, and the completion of the plan tasks is also inseparable from the support and assistance given to us by fraternal departments and local Party and government organs. We have no reason to feel proud and complacent. We should continue to work hard to overcome the many shortcomings in our work caused by right-leaning conservative thinking and bureaucracy. There are still many shortcomings in our work due to right-leaning conservative thinking and bureaucracy that we need to work hard to overcome.
    These shortcomings are mainly manifested in the following four aspects:
    First, the deployment of reconnaissance work has not adapted to the requirements of the long-term plan. Reconnaissance work is a highly comprehensive, complex, and meticulous geological investigation and research work. The process of reconnaissance work is also a comprehensive research process on the general geological conditions (including the distribution of useful mineral deposits) of a certain broad area, using methods such as geological surveying, geophysical surveying, geochemical surveying, drilling, and light mountain work. Its main purpose is to clarify the geological historical development laws of these regions, find the mineral deposits required by industry, and lay the foundation for further exploration work. Obviously, this is an important basic work. However, we have not done this basic work well enough. The quality of the data we have is very inconsistent; the regional distribution is also very uneven. For example, many vast mountainous areas, which are also areas where certain types of mineral deposits are likely to be abundant, are mostly blank spots on our geological maps. Since liberation, due to our one-sided emphasis on limited resources, we have concentrated almost all our efforts on key exploration work to complete the annual exploration tasks. We have not had time to do geological mapping of those blank spots, or to correct major errors on the already published geological maps.
    Now, most of the more promising mining areas that were discovered and investigated in the decades before liberation have been explored in a few years. In the future, the discovery of new mining areas will depend entirely on further detailed exploration based on the completion of reconnaissance work to obtain concrete results. In the past, the types and number of mineral deposits that have been explored were limited, and especially few rare mineral deposits of great value in industry have been explored. The already explored reserves of certain mineral raw materials are not balanced enough in their regional distribution; the geological data required for the development and utilization of other major rivers, as well as farmland, water conservancy, and transportation, are also far behind the requirements of national construction. Geological issues related to these many aspects must also be resolved by a large amount of reconnaissance work.
    Since 1954, we have deeply felt that our overall work has been severely affected by this weakness. We have only begun to scrape together resources to strengthen reconnaissance, re-deploy the technical forces for exploration and reconnaissance, increased the reconnaissance teams, and expanded the reconnaissance areas, and have achieved certain results. For example, the large iron ore deposits in Gansu and Sichuan, the large lead mines in Qinghai, Gansu, and Guizhou, and the molybdenum mines in Shaanxi and Shanxi were all discovered and confirmed after strengthening reconnaissance work. However, even today, the forces we can use for reconnaissance are still too small. In 1956, we added a batch of forces and received technical assistance from a large number of experts sent by the governments of the Soviet Union and Hungary to conduct regular 1:200,000 scale geological surveys in our country, and will conduct reconnaissance and inspection at hundreds of mineralization sites. We believe that better results will be achieved in future reconnaissance work. However, it is clear that even if we put all our current forces into reconnaissance, it will still seriously lag behind the urgent requirements of the present.
    Reconnaissance work and reporting of mineral deposits by the masses should be closely linked. However, in the past, due to the lack of reconnaissance forces, many information points reported by the masses could not be inspected in a timely manner, which has had a certain impact on the enthusiasm of the masses to report mineral deposits. At the same time, it is also possible that the discovery of certain mineral deposits with industrial value has been delayed for years. This point can also explain that the forces for reconnaissance work must be greatly strengthened. At the same time, the work of reporting mineral deposits by the masses also needs to be further developed.
    Second, the cultivation of technical forces, both in quantity and quality, is far behind the needs of the development of work. In recent years, with the development of work, the technical forces have grown to a certain extent. According to statistics, the geological exploration teams of several major industrial departments have grown and expanded to varying degrees year by year. As of the end of 1955, the total number of geological personnel with a university or college degree (excluding engineering and hydrogeology) working in the field in the four ministries of the Ministry of Geology, the former Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry was 2,625. Among them, the Ministry of Geology had 944, accounting for 36% of the total, the former Ministry of Heavy Industry had 668, accounting for 25.4% of the total, the Ministry of Coal Industry had 469 (including management agencies), accounting for 17.14% of the total, and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry had 544, accounting for 21.46% of the total. However, the geological technicians of any ministry feel that they are lacking, and many tasks that must be carried out have to be postponed due to insufficient technical personnel.
    In terms of the quality of existing technical personnel, except for a few mature cadres, most of them generally feel that they lack experience, and the technical level is also very inconsistent. Therefore, not every geological team is equipped with experienced senior technical cadres. When teams composed of inexperienced staff grope forward in the field, they often reflect many unpredictable practical problems that need to be solved before they can move forward in their work. In order to adapt to this situation, we have to use the limited strength of senior technical personnel as mobile forces to be used flexibly, so as to avoid the stagnation of field work or the occurrence of serious technical errors. This shows that not every field team across the country now has sufficient strength to fight independently, but needs to obtain the guidance of senior technical cadres at any time and place to carry out work. In this way, not only are the small number of senior cadres exhausted, but also in terms of time, they often do not have time to carry out the necessary inspection work, because they manage too much, and they themselves rarely have the opportunity to make necessary advanced studies in their professional fields to improve their scientific and technical level, and improving the scientific and technical level in each professional field is the central link to comprehensively improve the scientific and technical level of our geological work. This kind of situation should not be allowed to exist for a long time. We must use all methods to cultivate a sufficient number of senior technical cadres to ensure the quality of work of each field team.
    It should be pointed out here that, since the number of mineral deposits that have already been discovered and are easy to discover will become less and less in the future, this requires geological personnel to not only carry out general exploration tasks, but also strive to engage in scientific research and improve their technical level in order to solve the many difficult problems that will inevitably be encountered in the future. However, in recent years, the improvement of our general scientific and technical level is not adapted to the requirements of the new situation.
    The main reason for the formation of the above situation is that we have right-leaning conservative thinking in terms of increasing technical forces, and we do not have a sufficient understanding of the country's large need for geological cadres. This is manifested in the fact that the Ministry of Geology did not promptly make appropriate requests for the enrollment plans of geological colleges from the point of view of development. Therefore, not enough schools were run, and too few students were enrolled. The Chengdu Geological College and four secondary professional schools, as well as certain short-term training courses and several spare-time schools, which could have been established earlier, only began to be held this year. Some geological colleges could have been expanded earlier, but we often did not promptly help them to eliminate difficulties immediately, so that the expansion work was delayed.
    In addition, our failure to pay special attention to the training of geological cadres from minority nationalities is also a shortcoming in our cadre training work. The area inhabited by minority nationalities is very large, and these areas are often areas rich in resources. The outstanding youth of minority nationalities today must be willing to contribute their own strength to the cause of socialist construction of the motherland and to discover treasures for the motherland in the areas they are familiar with. However, in the past, we did not take special measures to solve the existing difficulties in this regard. In the future, this should be given detailed consideration as a problem that urgently needs to be solved in geological colleges, and feasible methods for training geological cadres from minority nationalities should be formulated.
    In addition, regarding the importance of improving the scientific and technical level of geological personnel, I now cannot remember how many times I have raised such a slogan at large and small gatherings. However, I have not seriously studied specific methods, which is indeed a typical manifestation of bureaucracy. It was only recently that we decided to gradually add seven scientific research institutions within the next two years to conduct in-depth research separately, so as to solve the scientific and technical problems related to production practice in geological work. For the rational use of existing senior technical personnel, especially in order to ensure that the main aspects of geological science reach or approach the international advanced scientific and technical level within twelve years, we must allow them to give full play to their potential and make appropriate adjustments to the main directions of their work.
    Before the above-mentioned problems have been properly resolved, we believe that in the current situation of a lack of senior geological personnel, it is not appropriate to disperse the geological forces, so as to avoid the lack of technical leadership and duplication of work, and the phenomenon of waste of labor. The most economical and reasonable method is to unify planning and further improve the division of labor and cooperation among various geological departments to ensure the timely acquisition of mineral reserves and geological data required for national construction in a comprehensive survey manner.
    Third, we are too conservative in the material equipment plan. Geological work is scattered, fluid, and develops rapidly. Therefore, the proportion of material reserves should generally be slightly higher in order to cope with urgent needs. However, in the past, we did not have a sufficient understanding of this characteristic, and we were poor in material preparation. When we submitted the plan to the state planning agency, we did not emphasize this point enough. As a result, many exploration sites were forced to stop work due to the lack of supply of a small number of equipment, resulting in the interruption of exploration and causing great losses in work. For example, due to the shortage of seamless steel pipes and other steel materials, 22% of the drilling rigs could not be fully equipped and had to stop work and wait for materials. Field teams also lack automobiles and other transportation tools. In some places where work vehicles can be used, field personnel have to walk long distances on foot because there are no vehicles available, so work efficiency cannot be improved, or although efficiency has improved somewhat, it cannot be sustained. Some exploration sites have postponed the start of work because equipment and materials cannot be transported.
    In order to improve the work of material supply, in addition to further clearing assets, extensively tapping potential, and expanding the source of material supply, we also require the national material supply department to increase the quantity of material allocation to ensure the needs of future work development.
    Fourth, we do not care enough about the livelihood and welfare of employees. In recent years, the livelihood and welfare of employees of the Ministry of Geology have improved to a certain extent with the development of production. However, this is far from being commensurate with the increase in the labor productivity of employees, and many special problems in the livelihood and welfare of employees have not been fundamentally resolved for a long time. The rate of increase in the labor productivity of employees of the Ministry of Geology has increased greatly year by year, and the resources found for the country are indeed considerable. For example, calculated on the basis of iron ore, the exploration cost for exploring one ton of iron ore is only about three cents, which can be said to be a "high-yield" thing. However, the rate of wage increase has been too low in recent years, and too little money has been spent on employee welfare. The average accommodation construction cost per employee per year is only about 18 yuan. The housing problem, which is most urgently needed by employees, has not been properly resolved. Due to the lack of field housing, the vast majority of field personnel can only live separately from their families in different places and cannot be reunited for a long time. Also, due to the heavy exploration tasks, many field team employees cannot go home for two or three years, and their children's schooling is also very problematic. The children of employees who transfer with the team are out of school for a long time, which increases some burdens on the minds of some field employees and makes them uneasy. Some reflect that: "Exploration, exploration, wives and children are separated," "Glory, glory, endless hardship." Many employees are dissatisfied that their children cannot go to school and complain: "The whole country is eliminating illiteracy, and the Ministry of Geology is creating illiteracy." Since the housing and public holidays of field team employees are not well resolved, the marriage problem of employees seems even more serious. Those who do not have a partner cannot find a partner, those who have a partner cannot get married, and those who are married cannot be reunited. Another serious problem in the livelihood and welfare of employees is the extreme lack of supply of living materials. In general, local Party and government organs and commercial departments provide great support and assistance to geological exploration teams. However, due to our work being too fluid and scattered, and the poor transportation conditions, living materials are still extremely insufficient. Not only are the prices of goods high and it is impossible to buy the necessary supplies and eat vegetables, but there is also a constant danger of running out of food and water.
    Another serious problem felt by field team employees is the lack of medical personnel, the inability to receive timely treatment for diseases, and the lack of health guarantees. The health department also provides great support in this regard. In terms of the total proportion of personnel, the number of medical personnel equipped by the Ministry of Geology is not less than that equipped by large factories. However, due to being too scattered and the harsh natural environment, there is a feeling that there are not enough medical personnel, or the level is too low to meet the requirements. Some of the existing medical personnel feel that the equipment is insufficient and it is difficult to improve their skills, so they are not at ease in their work. However, geological exploration personnel urgently need medical personnel with a certain level of service, and this problem also needs to be properly resolved.
    Then there is the extremely poor cultural life, it is difficult to see movies, and even more difficult to see operas. Newspapers and magazines cannot be seen in a timely manner. Some employees reflect: "If I stay in the exploration team for a few more years, I will become a savage."
    These special problems related to the livelihood and welfare of employees have not been resolved for a long time, which has affected the work mood of employees. This is a call for dissatisfaction with the livelihood and welfare, and also a criticism of our work. The leadership of the Ministry of Geology should bear the main responsibility, and there is bureaucracy. Many problems that we are unable to solve ourselves have not been reported to the State Council and relevant departments in a timely manner, so that some departments do not have enough understanding of the special and serious situation in the livelihood and welfare of geological exploration personnel.
    In order to solve the above-mentioned special problems related to the livelihood and welfare of employees, some major welfare undertakings should be carried out step by step, giving priority to urgent needs. First, we should request special funds to build rear bases in several cities for the field personnel of the geological department, concentrate their families in the base, and set up nurseries, primary schools, and other institutions to educate their children; give field personnel certain public holidays so that they can return to the base and reunite with their families after intense work. At the same time, we should also build necessary simple houses in the exploration area so that some of the exploration personnel's families can live with the team. Secondly, we should establish a sanatorium for employees in the rear base and replenish the medical institutions of the field teams. Due to the characteristics of the geological exploration team, we should consider taking some special measures to ensure the health of employees, such as setting up central medical stations, setting up radio communication equipment, and even helicopters to cope with emergencies. In addition, we should add transportation equipment and strengthen the supply of living materials. Some of these measures, under the care of the central government, have begun to be planned, and we also require the strong support and assistance of all relevant departments so that the employees of the field teams can always maintain full labor enthusiasm and discover more underground treasures.
    Finally, we very much welcome all representatives and people from all walks of life to visit the geological exploration teams more often to inspect and guide our work.

    地质部执行五年计划的情况和问题
    ——地质部长李四光的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于国家预决算的报告。现在，我就地质部执行第一个五年计划的情况和有关的问题向各位代表简单的陈述一下。旧中国遗留下来的地质工作落后状况，几年来有了深刻的变化；我们在执行五年计划方面取得了一定的成绩
    地质部是适应国家有计划的经济建设的需要，在1952年下半年成立的，这是我国地质工作正式纳入国家计划轨道的开始。在第一个五年计划期间地质部的基本任务，是保证国家在第一个五年计划建设期间主要建设项目的矿物原料储量和其他地质资料的需要，并为第二个五年计划建设对地质勘探的要求，作好必要的准备。几年来，我们围绕这一任务进行了紧张的工作，工作量每年都是成倍的增加，过去四年间所进行的工作总量，大大地超过了旧中国将近半个世纪矿产资源勘探工作的总量。在工作猛烈扩展的同时，我们不断采用了新技术，改善了技术装备，壮大了技术力量。现在，地质勘探人员已分布在全国各省，担任着数十种矿物原料的勘探任务。地球物理探矿、地球化学探矿等新的工种，在最近四年内有了一些发展，航空探测、放射性探测等新技术已开始被采用；水文地质工程地质工作，已从仅仅担任矿山水文地质勘测扩大到担任黄河、长江等大河流域规划和巨大水力枢纽勘测工作了。所有这些都说明：旧中国所遗留下来的地质工作落后的状况，已在短短数年间发生了深刻的变化。
    几年来，由于我们执行了中央的指示，得到了全国人民的关怀与支持以及苏联和其他兄弟国家的技术援助，使我们在执行五年计划方面取得了一定的成绩。截至目前为止，已探明了几个大的铁矿、锰矿、煤矿，基本上满足了武汉、包头、华北等几个大的钢铁联合企业的建设需要，在有色金属方面，建立了西北、华北、华东、湖南等地的铜、铅锌矿物原料基地。此外在甘肃和四川又找到了规模较大的铁矿，在青海找到了很大的铅矿，在陕西找到相当规模的钼矿，对于我国腹地的工业建设有重大的意义。从1955年起，地质部担任了石油普查的任务，与石油工业部协同工作，寻找天然石油，一年多以来在新疆、青海、四川、华北、鄂尔多斯等地区布置了大量的工作，在上述等地区发现了近两百个大小不等的可能储油构造和广泛分布的油苗或油踪。最近并且在柴达木盆地从正在进行打钻的一系列探井中陆续冒出或喷出了原油和天然气，在这些事实面前，假如还要固执以前从某些资本主义国家方面传来的成见，武断地硬说中国是个贫油国家，那是没有道理的，那也是对我们发展国民经济的远景计划不利的。此外，我们和水利、城市建设等部门协作进行了水文地质工程地质工作。为了适应农业发展对于矿物肥料的需要，我们在西南、华东探明了相当储量的磷矿。
    这些成就，大大地改变了对于我国的资源远景的认识，增强了我国人民对于社会主义建设的热情，鼓舞了我们提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的信心。特别是去年全国社会主义革命高潮掀起之后，广大职工的社会主义建设热情空前高涨，先进生产者和先进生产记录不断出现，在这样一个新的形势下，我们在计划1956年工作时，来了一个跃进，例如1956年的钻探工作量，就比1955年增加了2.7倍，普查勘探项目增加了2.6倍，并从1956年起，开始在几个地区进行正规的1∶200，000比例尺的地质测量，同时对几百个已知矿化地点进行普查检查，来加强找矿工作，扩大后备产地。经过今年一年紧张工作之后，预计铁矿储量可以累积完成五年计划的144％，锰为125％，铜为102％，铅141％，钼355％，黄铁矿407％，磷316％，煤106％，锡95％，此外，还可交出五年计划未规定任务的镁、镍、铬、石棉、压电石英、金刚石、云母、硼砂……等十九种矿物的一定储量。这就是说，五年计划所规定的地质部的矿产储量任务，除个别矿种以外，均可提前一年完成。当然，计划所规定的指标，只是国家从目前的生产水平出发所定的起码要求，而且完成计划任务也是与兄弟部门和地方党、政机关所给予我们的支持协助分不开的，我们没有任何理由感到骄傲自满，我们应该继续努力克服由于右倾保守思想和官僚主义所造成的工作上的许多缺点。在工作中仍然有由于右倾保守思想和官僚主义所造成的许多缺点，需要我们去努力克服
    这些缺点主要表现在下列四个方面：
    第一、普查工作的部署没有适应远景计划的要求。普查工作是一项具有高度综合性的复杂而又细致的地质调查研究工作。普查工作的过程，也就是对一定广泛地区的一般地质情况（包括有用矿床的分布），利用地质测量、地球物理勘测、地球化学勘测、钻探和轻型山地工作等方法，进行综合性的研究过程。它的主要目的是在于阐明这些地区的地质历史发展规律，找到工业上所要求的矿产地，并为进一步的勘探工作打下基础。很显然，这是一项重要的基本工作。但是，这项基本工作，我们做得很不够，我们所掌握的资料，质量很不一致；在地区分布上也很不平衡，例如许多辽阔的山区，也正是某些种类的矿床很可能是丰富的地区，在我们的地质图上，多半是空白点。解放以来，由于我们片面地强调了力量有限，几乎把所有的力量集中在重点勘探工作，来完成逐年勘探任务，对于那些空白点地质填图，对于已经出版的地质图上，重大错误的纠正，都没有来得及做。
    现在，把解放前几十年间发现的和调查过的比较有希望的矿区，在几年的时间内，已经大都勘探完了，今后新矿区的发现，就要全靠在完成普查的基础上，进行进一步详细勘探，才能获得具体的结果。过去，已经勘探出来的矿种和数目有限，某些在工业上具有重大价值的稀有矿种，尤其勘探得太少。若干项矿物原料已经勘探的储量在地区上分布还不够平衡；其他大河流的开发利用，以及农田、水利、交通运输等方面所需要的地质资料，也还大大地落后于国家建设的要求。有关这许多方面的地质问题，也必须依靠大量普查工作才能加以解决。
    自1954年以来，深深地感到我们的整体工作，由于这一方面的弱点受到严重的影响，我们才开始罗掘力量，加强普查，从新部署了勘探和普查的技术力量，增加了普查队，扩大了普查地区，收到了一定效果，如甘肃和四川的大型铁矿，青海、甘肃、贵州等地的大铅矿，陕西、山西的钼矿等都是在加强普查工作后发现和证实的。但是我们直到今天能用到普查的力量，依然是太少，1956年我们增加了一批力量，并得到苏联、匈牙利政府派遣了大批专家来我国进行技术援助，选定了几个地区，进行正规的1∶200，000比例尺的地质测量，并将在数百个矿化点上进行普查检查，我们相信今后的普查工作会取得更好的成果的。但是，很清楚，即使把我们现在所有力量投入普查，那还是严重地落后于当前迫切的要求。
    普查工作和群众报矿是应该密切联系的，但过去由于普查力量的不够，对于许多群众报矿的情报地点，不能及时地加以检查，这对于群众报矿的积极性是有一定影响的，同时也有可能使某些具有工业价值的矿产地延迟了发现的年月。这一点也可以说明普查工作的力量，还须大大地加强起来。同时群众报矿工作也还需要进一步开展。
    第二、技术力量的培养，无论在数量上和质量上，都远远赶不上工作发展的需要。几年来，随着工作的发展，技术力量有了一定的增长，据统计几个主要工业部门的地质勘探队伍，逐年均有不同程度的发展壮大，截至1955年底为止，地质部、前重工业部、煤炭工业部及石油工业部四个部在野外工作的大学专科以上程度的地质人员（不包括工程及水文地质）共为2，625人，其中地质部有944人占总数的36％，前重工业部有668人占总数25.4％，煤炭工业部有469人（包括管理机构）占总数17．14％，石油工业部有544人占总数21.46％，但是无论那个部的地质技术人员都感到缺乏，许多必须开展的工作因技术人员不够而不得不推迟。
    就现有技术人员的质量而言，除少数成熟的干部以外，一般都感到缺少经验，技术水平也很不一致。因此，不是每个地质队都配备有经验的高级技术干部。当那些缺少经验的工作人员组成的队伍，在野外摸索前进的时候，往往反映许多不可预测的实际问题，需要加以解决，他们才能在工作中前进。为了适应这种形势，我们就不得不把有限的高级技术人员的力量，作为机动部队，灵活使用，以免实地工作停滞，或在技术方面犯严重错误。这就说明，我们现在在全国各地的野外队，不是每一个队都具有充实的力量单独作战，而是随时随地需要获得高级技术干部的指导，来进行工作。这样一来，不独为数不多的高级干部，疲于奔命，并且在时间上他们也往往来不及进行必要的检查工作，因为他们管得太多，他们自己在专业方面，也就很难得机会作必要的进修，提高自己的科学技术水平，而就各个专业方面提高科学技术水平，正是全面地提高我们地质工作的科学技术水平的中心环节。这样一种情况，是不应该长期允许存在的。我们必须用一切的方法培养足够数量的高级技术干部，来保证每一个野外队的工作质量。
    在这里应该指出，由于已经发现和易于发现的矿床，今后将越来越少，这就要求地质人员除执行一般的勘探任务外，还要努力从事科学研究，提高技术水平，才能解决今后必然遇到的许多困难问题。但是，几年来，我们一般的科学技术水平的提高，是与新的形势的要求不相适应的。
    形成上述状况的主要原因，是我们在增长技术力量方面，存在着右倾保守思想，对国家在地质干部方面的大量需要认识不足，表现在地质部没有从发展的观点对地质院校的招生计划，及时的提出适当的要求，因此，学校办得不够多，学生招得太少。本来可以早办的成都地质学院和四个中等专业学校，以及某些短期训练班和若干业余学校，到今年才开始举办，有的地质院校本来可以早些扩建，也往往没有及时帮助他们立即解除困难，以致扩建工作推延下去。
    此外，我们对培养少数民族的地质干部没有特别加以重视，也是我们培养干部工作中的缺点。少数民族所居住的地区的面积很大，而这些地区又往往是资源丰富的地区，少数民族的优秀的青年，今天一定是为祖国社会主义建设事业，勇于贡献出他们自己的力量，在他们所熟悉的地区，为祖国发掘宝藏，但我们过去在这方面，并没有采取特殊措施，来解决存在的困难。今后在地质院校中应作为一个亟待解决的问题，加以详尽的考虑，制订培养少数民族地质干部的确实可行的办法。
    另外，关于地质人员的科学技术水平提高的重要性，现在我记不清有多少次在大小的集会上，提出了这样的口号，但是，一直对具体的办法没有好好的研究，这确实是典型的官僚主义的表现。直到最近，才决定了在今明两年内，陆续增设七个科学研究机构，来分别进行深入的研究，借以解决地质工作中有关生产实践方面的科学技术问题。对于现有高级技术人员的合理使用，特别是为了在十二年内，一定要把地质科学的主要方面达到或者接近国际的先进科学技术水平，我们必须让他们发挥潜力，并对他们工作中主要致力的方向，加以适当的调整。
    在以上各项问题还没有得到适当的解决以前，我们认为在目前高级地质人员缺乏的情况下，不宜把地质力量，分散使用，以免发生缺乏技术领导和工作重复，浪费劳动力的现象，最经济最合理的办法是，统一规划，进一步改善各个地质部门的分工协作的状况，来保证以综合勘测的方式，及时取得国家建设所需要的矿产储量和地质资料。
    第三、在物资装备计划方面过于保守。地质工作分散、流动、发展猛烈，因而，物资贮备比例一般应稍高，才能应付紧急的需要，但过去我们对这个特点认识不足，对物资准备较差，当我们对国家计划机关提出计划时，我们没有足够的强调这一点，结果，往往由于数量不大的器材供应不上，而引起许多勘探工地被迫停工，造成勘探中断，招致工作上很大的损失。例如由于无缝钢管等钢材不足，就有22％的钻机不能成套配备，只好停工待料。野外各队的汽车等交通运输工具也非常缺乏，有些可以用工作车的地方，因无车可配备，野外人员只好靠两条腿长途行走，因而工作效率不能提高，或效率虽提高了一些，但不能持久，有些勘探工地因器料运不到，推迟了开工时间。
    在改进物资供应工作方面，我们除进一步清理资产，广泛发掘潜力，扩大物资供应来源外，也要求国家物资供应部门追加物资调拨数量，以保证今后工作发展的需要。
    第四、对职工生活福利关心不够。几年来，地质部职工的生活福利随着生产的发展有了一定的改善，但是，与职工劳动生产率的提高远远不相适应，而且，职工生活福利上的许多特殊问题也长期未得到根本解决。地质部职工的劳动生产率逐年上升的幅度很大，为国家找到的资源也确实不少，如以铁矿计算，探得一吨铁矿所开支的勘探费只需三分钱左右，可说是
  “一本万利”的事情，但几年来工资上涨率太低，用在职工福利上的钱太少，平均每年每个职工所摊得的住宿建筑费不过18元左右，对职工感到最迫切需要的住宅问题始终没有妥善解决。由于野外住宅少，绝大部分野外人员只能与家属分居异地，长期不得团聚，又由于勘探任务繁重，野外队职工两三年不得回家者很多，子女读书也很成问题，随队转移的职工的子女长期失学，这样就在若干野外职工思想上增加一些负担，情绪不安，有的反映说：“勘探勘探，妻离子散，”“光荣光荣，艰苦无穷”。不少职工对他们的子女不能上学而不满，发牢骚说：“全国各地扫除文盲，地质部在制造文盲”。由于野外队职工的住宅和公休假解决得不好，职工的婚姻问题也就显得更严重，没有对象的找不到对象，有对象的结不了婚，结了婚的不能团聚。职工生活福利上的另一严重问题是生活物资供应十分不足，各地方党政机关和商业部门对地质勘探队支援帮助一般的是很大的，但由于我们工作过于流动分散，交通运输条件较差，生活物资仍然极端不足，不仅物品价钱高，买不到需要的用品，吃不到青菜，而且还经常有断粮断水的危险。
    野外队职工感到另一严重的问题是医务人员缺乏，疾病得不到及时的治疗，健康没有保证。在这一方面卫生部门支援也很大，从人数总比例来说，地质部所配备的医务人员比大工厂备配的并不少，但由于过于分散，自然环境艰苦，因此就感到医务人员不够，或者是水平较低不符要求。现有医务人员有的感到设备不够，技术提高困难，不安心工作，而地质勘探人员却迫切需要有一定水平的医务人员来服务，这个问题也得需要适当的解决。
    再就是文化生活极为贫乏，很难看到电影，更看不到戏，报纸、杂志也不能及时看到，有些职工反映：“再在勘探队几年就成了野人了”。
    这些有关职工生活福利上的特殊问题，长期得不到解决，已经影响了职工的工作情绪，这是他们对生活福利上一种不满的呼声，也是对我们工作的批评，地质部领导上应负主要责任，有官僚主义，许多我们自己无力解决的问题也没有及时向国务院和有关部门反映，以致有些部门对地质勘探人员生活福利中的特殊严重情况了解不够。
      为了解决上述有关职工生活福利的若干特殊问题，应该分别缓急，逐步举办一些重大的福利事业，首先要求拨专款为地质部门野外人员在若干城市修建后方基地，将他们的家属集中到基地居住，设立托儿所、小学校等教育他们的子女；给野外人员一定的公休假，使他们在紧张工作之后，可以回到基地和家人团聚。同时，也在勘探地区增建必要的简单住宅，使部分勘探人员的家属可以随队居住。其次是在后方基地建立职工疗养院，充实野外队的医疗机构，由于地质勘探队的特点，应当考虑采取一些特殊措施，来保证职工健康，如设置中心医疗站，设置无线电通话装备，甚至直升飞机等，来应付紧急情况。此外，应增添运输设备，加强生活物资供应。这些措施，我们有的已在中央的关怀下，着手筹划，还要求各有关部门能大力支持协助，使野外队职工永远保持充沛的劳动热情，发掘更多的地下宝藏。
    最后，我们很欢迎各位代表和各阶层人士，有机会多到地质勘探队去视察，指导我们的工作。
