Strive to Complete the Five-Year Plan in Four Years
——Speech by Representative Meng Tai

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I guarantee to work hard in future practical work to realize the various requirements put forward by the leaders in their reports.

Now I will briefly report to the conference on some of the production situation of our Anshan Iron and Steel Works’ Ironmaking Plant. At the beginning of this year, in response to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for more, faster, better, and more economical results, all the workers of our Ironmaking Plant, like other brother factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel, put forward the glorious goal of completing the Five-Year Plan in four years, and after heated and detailed discussions, formulated various measures to achieve this goal. For several months, all workers, technicians, and staff have been putting themselves into the upsurge of production with great enthusiasm. With the close cooperation of brother factories and mines, the Ironmaking Plant comprehensively overfulfilled the output, quality, and cost plans in the first quarter of this year and in April and May, and also guaranteed safe production. This is the result of all the workers and comrades further displaying their socialist enthusiasm in the upsurge of socialist construction, everyone using their brains, thinking of many ways, and improving the level of production technology. As far as the equipment maintenance and repair work I lead is concerned, we have improved the inspection system, repair tools, and repair methods, which greatly reduced the downtime of the blast furnace and increased production capacity. For example: a system of dedicated personnel responsible for the taphole was established, with fixed standards for how much mud to use and how much mud to remove. An inspection system was also established at the slag outlet, which not only improved production but also ensured production safety. For example, in terms of furnace body maintenance, we adopted the method of welding water tanks made of iron plates inside the blast furnace; for thin parts of the furnace wall, we lined them with refractory bricks and mud from the inside, then welded iron sheets on the outside and watered them with water pipes. And we established a system of dedicated personnel responsible and dedicated personnel inspecting, and immediately carried out emergency repairs when small problems such as fire or gas leaks were discovered. After this measure was universally adopted in various blast furnaces, the working time of the blast furnaces was extended, the downtime of the blast furnaces was reduced, the utilization rate of the blast furnaces was increased, and production was increased.

In terms of repair work, our workers and comrades have come up with 10 rapid repair methods. For example, in the past, when replacing the hot blast valve and water ring of the blast furnace, we used manpower to push the mill and wind the pulley to load and unload, which took 24 hours each time. Now it has been changed to using a winch and improving the labor organization, which only takes 3 hours each time. Another example is replacing the steel rope in sections one and two of the large cover machine. In the past, we used clips, but now we use rope sleeves, which reduces the time consumed from the original 12 hours to 5 hours. Replacing heavy-duty wheels has also been shortened from the original 30 minutes to 5 minutes. In addition, there are many rapid repair methods similar to these, which I will not list one by one. Because these rapid repair methods were adopted, the repair time was shortened, production was increased, and at the same time, manpower and materials were saved, costs were reduced, and safety was ensured. It is initially estimated that by using these methods, 40,000 tons of pig iron can be produced for the country throughout the year. We have also made some achievements in saving raw materials. At the beginning, our repair shop, under the initiative of the Communist Youth League Committee, established a Youth Conservation Team. In addition to paying attention to conservation, the conservation team also stipulated that every Friday is Conservation Day. On this day, from 6 am to 8 am, they carry out voluntary labor to collect scrap steel and raw materials. Everyone has a small booklet to record the collected raw materials at any time. As a result, various raw materials that can still be used were quickly collected. The factory leaders then convened a general meeting of all employees to mobilize everyone with this conservation fact, and then a universal conservation movement was launched. Regardless of men and women, old and young, workers and staff, they all automatically joined the movement. Even many female technicians and staff actively participated. A conservation king, Huang Jucheng, also emerged. Due to the extensive development of the mass conservation movement, more than 80 tons of scrap steel and various raw materials have been collected so far. Therefore, the repair shop did not receive any new materials in the fourth quarter of last year and the first and second quarters of this year, and now it has also put forward the slogan of ensuring that no materials will be received throughout the year. This has saved the country a lot of materials. For example, the 12 pieces of 4×8 feet iron plates and 7 tons of iron used by the riveters group of the repair shop last year to manufacture cast iron machine parts were all replaced with collected scrap. In addition, some new tools were manufactured using waste materials. The two winches used to quickly replace hot blast valves and water rings mentioned earlier were made using waste materials. We also plan to use the collected waste materials to manufacture ten more winches and fix them around the blast furnace to replace manual labor more and achieve mechanization.

However, we still have some shortcomings and problems in equipment maintenance and material conservation. For example, some equipment (such as gantry cranes) still often have problems, and we have not been able to completely repair them. It only takes one and a half hours to replace the hot blast valve and water ring in the Soviet Union, which is much shorter than the time we use, so we should find ways to improve it. In terms of saving materials, at present, many departments still do not have strict enough material management, and old materials or leftover materials are not well recycled in a timely manner. Some workers' rationalization proposals have not been implemented in a timely manner. These shortcomings and problems need to be overcome and resolved by us.

I believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and with the support of brother factories, we will surely be able to victoriously realize the solemn task of completing the Five-Year Plan in four years and produce more pig iron for the country. Let us move forward victoriously with full confidence!

    争取五年计划四年完成 
    ——孟泰代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理，廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长的报告，并保证在今后实际工作中，努力实现各位首长在报告中提出的各项要求。
    现在我把我们鞍钢炼铁厂的某些生产情况，简单地向大会汇报一下。在今年年初响应党中央和毛主席又多又快又好又省的号召，我们炼铁厂的全体职工和鞍钢的其他兄弟厂矿一样，为自己提出了五年计划四年完成的光荣目标，而且经过热烈细致的讨论，拟出了实现这个目标的种种措施。几个月来全体工人，技术人员和职员都以十分饱满的情绪投入了生产高潮。在兄弟厂矿的密切配合下，炼铁厂今年第一季度和四、五月份都全面超额完成了产量、质量和成本计划，而且保证了安全生产。这就是在社会主义建设高潮中，全体职工同志们，进一步发挥了社会主义的积极性，大家开动脑筋，想了很多办法，提高了生产技术水平的结果。就我自己领导的设备维护检修工作来说，我们改进了检查制度、检修工具和检修方法，使高炉的停息时间大为减少，增加了生产能力。例如：建立了出铁口专人负责制，对出铁口用多少泥，取下多少泥，都定了固定标准，在出渣口也建立了检查制度，这不但提高了生产，而且保证了生产的安全。又如在炉体维护方面，采取了用铁板作成水箱焊在高炉里边的办法；对炉墙薄的地方，则用耐火砖和泥从里边砌上，然后用铁皮焊上，外边用水管浇水。并且建立了专人负责，专人检查的制度，一发现冒火、冒瓦斯等微小毛病时，就立刻进行抢修。经过在各个高炉普遍采取这个措施，就延长了高炉的工作时间，减少了高炉的停修时间，提高了高炉的利用率，增加了生产。
    在检修工作上，我们的职工同志大家想办法，已经创造出10项快速检修方法。譬如，过去换高炉热风瓣和水圈时，是用人推磨、绞练子绞的办法来装卸，每换一次就得24个小时，现在改为用卷扬机，并改善了劳动组织，每次只要3小时。再如换大盖机一、二段钢绳，过去用卡子，现在改用绳套的办法，耗用时间由原来的12小时缩短为5小时，换重量车轮也由原来的30分钟缩短为5分钟。此外，还有许多和这些性质相似的快速检修方法，我就不一一列举了。由于采取了这些快速检修法，就缩短了检修时间，提高了生产，同时节省了人力、物力，降低了成本，也保证了安全。初步预计，利用这些方法，全年可为国家多生产4万吨生铁。在节省原材料方面，我们也取得了一些成绩。我们修理厂开始时，在团委的倡议下，成立了青年节约队，除了经常注意节约外，节约队还规定每星期五为节约日，在这天早晨6点到8点，进行义务劳动收集废钢铁和原材料，每个人有一本小册子，把收集到的原材料随时记入，这样作的结果，很快就收到了各种各样尚可以利用的原材料。厂的领导上随即召开了全体职工大会，以这个节约事实向大家进行动员，于是就展开了一个普遍的节约运动，不分男女老少，工人和职员，都自动地卷入到运动中来。连许多女技、职人员也积极参加了进来。还出现了一个节约大王黄聚成。由于广泛地开展了群众性的节约运动，到现在为止，已经收集了80多吨废钢铁和各种原材料。因而，修理厂去年四季度和今年一、二季度都没有新领原料，而且现在还提出了保证，今年全年不领料的口号。这就给国家节省了不少材料。例如只修理场铆工组一个组，去年制造铸铁机零件用的12块4×8尺铁板和7吨铁，就都是用收集来的废料代替的。另外还利用废料制造了一些新的工具，前面说的快速换热风瓣和水圈用的两台卷扬机就是利用废料制成的。我们还打算用收集来的废料再制造十台卷扬机，固定在高炉周围，更多地代替体力劳动，实现机械化。
    但我们在设备维护检修和材料节约方面还存在着一些缺点和问题。例如有些设备（如门型起重机）现在还时常出毛病，我们还没有能把它彻底修好。换热风瓣和水圈，在苏联只要一个半小时，比我们用的时间短得多，因此还应该想办法改进。在节约材料方面，目前许多部门对于材料管理还不够严格，旧料或剩料没有很好地及时回收。有些职工的合理化建议，实现得也不够及时。这些缺点和问题都需要我们加以克服和解决。
    我相信在党的英明领导下，在兄弟厂的支援下，我们一定能够胜利实现五年计划四年完成的庄严任务，为国家生产更多的生铁。让我们满怀信心地胜利前进吧！
