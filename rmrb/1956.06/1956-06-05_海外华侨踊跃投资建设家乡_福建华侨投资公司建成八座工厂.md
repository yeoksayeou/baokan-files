    Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Invest in and Build Their Hometowns
    Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Company Completes Construction of Eight Factories

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the total amount of investment received by the Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Company from overseas Chinese from January to May this year is already 2.6 times that of the same period last year.

    In the three years since its establishment, this investment company has utilized investments from overseas Chinese and the state to build eight modern factories in the hometowns of overseas Chinese, including machine-made sugar refineries, oil presses, and rosin refineries. Among them, the Quanzhou Sugar Factory, the Fuqing Oil Factory, and the Nanping Rosin Factory alone produced industrial products worth 5,605,000 yuan for the state last year, while also supporting the development of the nearby agricultural economy.

    This year, the company will also build and expand several factories, including the Xianyou Sugar Factory and the Fuzhou Paper Mill. The new Xianyou Sugar Factory has already begun construction and is expected to go into production next year. After the expansion of the Xiamen Cannery, its annual canned food production will increase fivefold compared to the present.

    Chen Yangzeng, Deputy Director of the company's office and a returned overseas Chinese, told reporters that since its establishment, the company has consistently implemented the state's policy of guaranteeing an annual dividend of 8% on overseas Chinese investments. To take care of the needs of overseas Chinese to support their families and their children's education, family members of shareholders can also borrow part of the dividend from the company on a monthly or quarterly basis.

    海外华侨踊跃投资建设家乡
    福建华侨投资公司建成八座工厂
    据新华社讯　福建华侨投资公司从今年一月到五月收到海外华侨投资的总额，已经等于去年同期的二点六倍。
    这个投资公司从成立到现在的三年多，利用华侨和国家的投资，在华侨的家乡建设了八座现代化的机器制糖、榨油、炼松香等工厂。其中仅泉州糖厂、福清油厂和南平松香厂等七个工厂，去年就为国家生产了价值五百六十万五千元的工业品，同时支援了附近农业经济的发展。
    今年，这个公司还将新建和扩建仙游糖厂、福州造纸厂等好几个工厂。新建仙游糖厂现在已经开始兴建，明年可以投入生产。厦门罐头厂扩建以后，每年生产的罐头，将比现在增加五倍。
    这个公司的办公室副主任、归国华侨陈仰曾对记者说，公司成立以来，始终执行国家对华侨投资保证按年利八厘付给股息的政策。为了照顾华侨赡养家庭和子女求学需要，股东们的家属还可以按月按季向公司借支部分股息。
