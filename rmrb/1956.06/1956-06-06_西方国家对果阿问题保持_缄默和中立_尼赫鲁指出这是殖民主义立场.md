Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 5th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in Bombay on May 4th that many Western countries maintain "silence and neutrality" on the colonial issue because they are colonialists.

Nehru said at a rally attended by 25,000 Goans: "Why don't they decide which side to stand on unless they have something to hide? Goa is the worst form of colonialism."

He said: The Goa issue involves India's national interests and national security. Portugal is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Nehru said that if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is involved in the conflict, then Goa will also be affected, which will put India in a difficult situation. He said: "We must not tolerate this situation."

Nehru said that if Portugal has been in Goa for about 500 years, so it has some right to stay there, that is no reason. That is an excuse. This statement will justify the continued existence of any tyranny anywhere. "The only answer to these excuses is that they have been there for so long, so they must get out quickly."

Nehru said that many foreign politicians, including those from NATO countries, have told him that Goa must eventually be returned to India. Nehru said: "But they said, 'Can you wait a few more years?' We have waited enough, we have waited too long."

Nehru said that Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar said that Goa is a "outpost" of Western civilization. Nehru said: "We know something about this Western civilization, and we oppose its evil ideas. Its main evil idea is colonialism."

### 西方国家对果阿问题保持“缄默和中立”  尼赫鲁指出这是殖民主义立场

    西方国家对果阿问题保持“缄默和中立”
    尼赫鲁指出这是殖民主义立场
    新华社新德里5日电　印度总理尼赫鲁五月四日在孟买说，许多西方国家对殖民问题保持“缄默和中立”，因为它们是殖民主义者。
    尼赫鲁在一次有二万五千名果阿人参加的集会上说：“除非他们要隐藏什么东西，否则他们为什么不决定站在哪一边呢？果阿是殖民主义中最坏的形式。”
    他说：果阿问题牵涉到印度的民族利益和民族安全。葡萄牙是北大西洋公约组织的成员国。尼赫鲁说，如果北大西洋公约组织卷入冲突，那么果阿也将受到影响，这样将使印度处于困难的境地。他说：“我们决不能容忍这种局势。”
    尼赫鲁说，如果说葡萄牙呆在果阿大约已经有五百年，因此它有某种权利呆在那里，那是没有理由的。那是遁词。这种说法将使任何地方的任何暴政统治的继续存在都是正当的了。“对这种遁词的唯一的答复是，它们在那里已经呆了这么久了，所以它们必须快快地退出去。”
    尼赫鲁说，许多外国政治家，包括北大西洋公约组织国家的那些政治家在内，曾经对他说，果阿最后一定要归还印度的。尼赫鲁说：“但是他们说：‘你能不能再等几年？’我们已经等够了，我们已经等得太久了。”
    尼赫鲁说，葡萄牙总理萨拉查说，果阿是西方文明的一个“前哨”。尼赫鲁说：“我们知道这种西方文明的一些情况，我们反对它的邪恶思想。它的主要的邪恶思想是殖民主义。”
