Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 4th -- This spring, the gully treatment projects completed in the northern region of Shaanxi Province exceeded twice the total projects completed in the entire year of 1955.

Since March, over 300 experts and engineering technicians from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have successively conducted large-scale surveys in the Wuding River basin. Consequently, gully treatment projects have commenced one after another in various locations. In dozens of large gullies within the Wuding River, Yan River, and Luo River basins, more than 30,000 farmers from counties such as Yan'an, Suide, and Yulin have actively constructed 32 large silt-retaining earth dams. In the Suide Special District, members of over 4,000 agricultural cooperatives have built more than 980 silt-retaining dams in numerous small tributary gullies. The 2,500 youth shock brigades, composed of 100,000 young people in this special district, have exhibited high labor efficiency and are known as "Tiger Teams." In addition to participating in dam construction, they have also completed over 250,000 mu of field projects for interception and silt retention. Farmers in counties such as Luochuan and Huangling have constructed over 1,600 gully-fixing valley terraces using methods such as willow planting and stone masonry within the loess plateau gullies. They have also constructed gully head protection projects at the top of over 400 large gullies. In April, over 200,000 farmers in the Yulin Special District launched a soil and water conservation assault month, completing over 2,500 various gully treatment projects.

The northern region of Shaanxi Province is the area with the most severe soil erosion in the Yellow River basin. Here, gullies crisscross the land, with approximately 5.3 kilometers of gullies per square kilometer, and they are constantly expanding. Every year, nearly 400 million tons of sediment are carried into the Yellow River by the Wuding River, Luo River, and Yan River, accounting for approximately 27% of the total sediment load of the Yellow River. Therefore, carrying out gully treatment projects in this region aims to control soil erosion and reduce sediment input into the Yellow River.

    控制水土流失和减少泥沙输入黄河
    陕北地区今春完成的沟壑治理工程超过去年两倍
    新华社西安4日电　陕西省北部地区今年春天完成的沟壑治理工程，超过了1955年全年工程的两倍。
    三月以来，黄河水利委员会和中国科学院的三百多名专家和工程技术人员，先后在无定河流域进行了大规模的勘查工作。于是，沟壑治理工程便在各地陆续开工。在无定河、延河、洛河流域的几十条大沟壑内，延安、绥德、榆林等县三万多农民积极修筑三十二座大型拦淤土坝。绥德专区四千多个农业社社员，在各地许多小支沟里修成了九百八十多座淤地坝。这个专区由十万名青年组成的两千五百个青年突击队，劳动效率很高，被人称为“老虎队”。他们除参加打坝外，还修成了二十五万多亩截流拦淤的田间工程。洛川、黄陵等县农民在黄土高原沟壑内，用插柳、砌石等办法修成一千六百多个护坡固沟的谷坊；还在四百多个大沟壑顶上修筑了沟头防护工程。榆林专区二十多万农民四月间开展水土保持突击运动月，共修成各种沟壑治理工程两千五百多座。
    陕西省北部地区是黄河流域水土流失最严重的地区。这里沟壑纵横，每平方公里内约有五点三公里的沟壑，并且还在不断发展。每年由无定河、洛河、延河输入黄河的泥沙近四亿吨，约占黄河总输沙量的27％。因此，在这个地区进行沟壑治理工程，目的是控制水土流失和减少泥沙输入黄河。
