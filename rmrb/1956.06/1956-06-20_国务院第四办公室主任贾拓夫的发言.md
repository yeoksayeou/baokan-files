Speech by Jia Tuofu, Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council

China's Light Industry Still Has Considerable Production Potential -- What are the Main Reasons for the Decline in the Quality of Some Light Industrial Products? -- We Must Emphasize the Idea of Integrating Product Output, Quality, Cost, and Production Safety -- We Must Strengthen Enterprise Management and Technical Leadership -- Scientific Research Institutions Should Study Key Issues in Product Quality -- Promote Production Departments to Care About the Sales of Their Products and Implement Price Differentiation Based on Product Quality -- Earnestly Pay Attention to Developing the Advantages of Handicraft Industry

Now I would like to express some opinions on the light industry, especially regarding the situation and problems related to product quality.

From the Second Session of the First National People's Congress to this session, a fundamental change has taken place in China's domestic situation. A high tide of socialist transformation has been set off in agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, achieving a decisive victory. This has opened up infinitely broad paths for the development of light industry. As everyone knows, raw materials and sales are two basic conditions for the development of light industry, and most of the raw materials and sales of light industry are in rural areas. Therefore, the result of the socialist transformation of agriculture will undoubtedly provide light industry with increasingly more raw materials and continuously expanding markets. The difficulties encountered by some light industry production in terms of raw material supply and product sales in previous years, especially in 1955, will be greatly reduced in the future. Of course, with raw materials and sales, there must also be corresponding production capacity. The actual situation indicates that China's light industry still has considerable production potential, especially in the original private enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, and the vast handicraft industry, which account for more than half of the national light industry output value. The potential is even greater. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts makes it possible to fully and rationally utilize these production potentials under the unified planning of the state. Coupled with some necessary reconstruction, expansion, and new construction, it will be possible to digest the raw materials increased by agricultural production and produce more products to supply the market. At the same time, the development of light industry can also accumulate construction funds for the country quickly and in large quantities, which is conducive to the rapid development of heavy industry.

When we talk about the favorable conditions for the development of light industry, we should also particularly point out the unprecedented high socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. As early as 1955, in order to overcome the difficulties encountered in light industry production due to the tight supply of agricultural raw materials, the broad masses of workers across the country, under the call of the Party and the government, launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy and achieved great results. For example, in the oil industry, in terms of improving oil yield and developing new oil sources, the original task of increasing the production of 100,000 tons of vegetable oil was completed with 130,000 tons after efforts. The textile industry in saving cotton and increasing the production of yarn and cloth, the brewing industry in improving the alcohol yield and saving grain, and other industries in improving the yield rate and saving raw materials have also achieved different degrees of results.

The bumper harvest in agriculture in 1955 prepared a good material foundation for light industry production in 1956, and the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and the initiative of the capitalist personnel. Therefore, since January 1956, a surging upsurge of the production increase movement has appeared in various light industry factories. The bumper harvest plus the upsurge is the basic reason why most light industry products in the first quarter of 1956 were able to overfulfill the production plan. The total output value of light industry in 1956 will increase by about 17% compared with 1955. In April 1956, the textile industry and light industry successively convened representative conferences of advanced producers, with about 1,500 advanced producers participating in the conferences, concentrating more than 600 advanced experiences, and organizing exchanges and promotions. This is of great significance and role in striving to complete the first five-year plan of light industry ahead of schedule.

However, it must be pointed out that in terms of the quality and variety of some light industrial products, they still cannot keep up with the requirements of the development of output and the needs of the people's lives, and there are still quite serious problems. The quality of light industry products in 1955 can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is that the quality of some products has generally improved compared with 1954, such as sugar, most machine-made paper, sulfonamide thiazole in medicines, cord fabric for special tires, some silk fabrics, export fabrics, woolen textiles, some printed and dyed fabrics, and leather, ceramics, etc., among which printed fabrics alone have increased more than 2,000 new patterns; The second category is that the quality of some products was not good in the first place. Although there have been some improvements in 1955, there are still many problems, such as canned meat, some medicines, etc.; The third category is that the quality of a considerable part of the products has declined to varying degrees, some of which are more serious, such as some food, cigarettes, medicines, gauze, rubber shoes, enamelware, thermos bottles, fountain pens, matches, soap, etc. There are still some quality problems: some alcoholic beverages are cloudy and tasteless, and the masses reflect that "it is not sour as vinegar, and it is not spicy as wine"; a few medicine tablets are "stubbornly unresolvable"; many cigarette branches are too loose and thin, and the taste is pungent and choking; the rate of substandard cloth of some cotton cloth has increased, and the masses call it "sesame cloth", the shrinkage rate of some colored cloth is large, and the color of some printed cloth is not firm, so-called "falling flowers have intention, flowing water is ruthless"; some poor quality thermos bottles are called "cold bottles" and "time bombs" by the masses; some fountain pens have deformed pen barrels, rough nibs, and leakage, and the masses reflect that they are "running noses"; some scented soaps are "fragrant on the skin but not on the flesh".

It should be pointed out that these serious quality situations have been noticed by all parties and comprehensive inspections have been carried out since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council instructed to improve product quality in the third quarter of 1955. Specific measures have been taken for some products with declining quality, and many improvements have been made. According to statistics from quality inspections in nine provinces and cities including Shanghai and Tianjin, in addition to some products with basically stable quality, the quality of about 260 kinds of products in the first quarter of this year improved compared with the fourth quarter of last year; however, the quality of 130 kinds of products still declined. It can be seen that the quality of light industry products, on the one hand, has significant improvements and increases, and on the other hand, there is still a trend of continued decline, and continuous efforts must be made to achieve comprehensive improvement.

Why has the phenomenon of quality decline occurred in some light industrial products? What measures should be taken to reverse the phenomenon of quality decline?

Some people say that the insufficient supply of raw materials, the poor quality of raw materials, or the variety of raw materials that is constantly changing have affected the improvement and stability of the quality of some products. We believe that this statement is not without certain reasons, because the quantity and quality of raw materials do have a great impact on the quality of some products. Taking cotton as an example, in the past few years, the quality of raw cotton was better in the fourth quarter of each year and the first quarter of the following year, and the quality of cotton yarn was also better; in the second and third quarters of the following year, the quality of raw cotton declined, and the quality of cotton yarn also declined accordingly. In light industry production, some raw materials (such as tobacco leaves, etc.) and products (such as white wine) need to be stored for a period of time and undergo natural changes in order to improve quality, but due to the tight supply, the inventory of industry and commerce has been repeatedly compressed, and too many low-grade and second-class raw materials have been used, which has also affected the quality. The variety and specifications of some imported raw materials (such as dyes for dyeing cloth, iridium gold for making fountain pen tips, and plastics for making pen barrels, etc.) and raw materials distributed by commercial departments (such as cotton and oil) are constantly changing, which also affects operation and quality. These are all facts, and we must see this point and should take some necessary and possible measures to improve the supply of raw materials.

First of all, in terms of raw material allocation, it is required to make reasonable calls according to the current raw material situation, and gradually change the situation that the supply of raw materials has been good and bad in the past, and try to allocate raw materials accordingly according to different products. For example, high-count yarn and low-count yarn, beverage alcohol and industrial and sanitary alcohol, edible vegetable oil and vegetable oil for making soap, etc., have great differences in raw material requirements. If more reasonable allocation can be achieved, it may be possible to gradually change the unreasonable situation of using low-grade raw materials for high-grade products and high-grade raw materials for low-grade products. Secondly, it is required to gradually improve the quality of raw materials and reduce impurities in raw materials. In order to gradually achieve this, production departments and purchasing and supply departments can agree on the standard of impurities in raw materials through agreements; and gradually improve the processing and grading of raw materials in a planned way in the future. It should be seen that improving the variety, quality, and procurement allocation of raw materials is a very complex task. It is a task that requires the joint efforts of production departments and commercial departments to do well. Commercial purchasing departments have done a lot of work to improve the procurement and allocation of raw materials under various difficult conditions in recent years. Therefore, the above-mentioned work can only be gradually resolved according to needs and possible conditions.

However, the quantity and quality of raw materials are not the only reasons for the decline in the quality of some light industrial products, or even the main reasons. In fact, there are other reasons for the decline in the quality of some products. These reasons, compared with the problem of raw materials, I think are more important. That is, some industrial departments and enterprises neglect product quality and technical management is weak.

From the results of the quality inspection of products by various departments and regions, it is first exposed that some comrades have one-sided views and views that do not attach importance to quality in their thinking, and they oppose increasing production and practicing economy and improving quality. This is one of the main reasons for the decline in the quality of some light industry products.

When we implement the instructions of increasing production and practicing economy, we generally put forward the "strive to increase production and practice economy on the premise of ensuring quality," but the requirements and measures to ensure quality are often not specific, while increasing production and practicing economy have numerical indicators. Some comrades have insufficient understanding of the important significance of production for meeting the growing needs of the masses, so they have ignored the quality of products in the movement to increase production and practice economy. When the market demand for several light industrial products is very large and the supply of raw materials is insufficient, measures have been taken to change the formula, reduce the amount of materials used, and find substitute raw materials, etc. This is necessary, and many of them are done correctly, and the economic effect of increasing production and practicing economy has been obtained without damaging the quality of the products. But there are also many that are one-sided savings, which damage the quality. Why are some cigarette branches too light? It is because the amount of tobacco used is deducted layer by layer. Why is the color of some light-colored printed fabrics in Shanghai not bright? It is because the amount of dyes and chemicals has been generally reduced by about 20%. Why is the alkali resistance, acid resistance, and heat resistance of some glass tubes used for injections reduced? It is because the amount of alumina and borax has been reduced. Why is the sound of some accordions incorrect, and some cannot even make a sound? It is because zinc alloy reeds are used instead of copper reeds. The cotton textile industry paid attention to "not wasting spinnable fibers" in the treatment of impurities in raw materials, but some factories reduced the impurity removal efficiency and increased the impurity content of yarn and cloth. The cigarette industry paid attention to "no stems in the leaves," but some factories ignored "no stems in the leaves." If the impurities are not removed cleanly, it will inevitably affect the quality of the product. Some products have shortened the effective storage period due to "simplified" packaging. The Guangming brand milk powder of Shanghai State-owned Food Factory was originally well packaged in bottles, but after being changed to paper boxes, it is easy to get damp and clump. All of this shows that one-sided saving of raw materials and inappropriate use of substitutes is wrong.

From here, we should learn a lesson. That is, we must continue to carry out ideological education on increasing production and practicing economy and improving product quality among the broad masses of workers. Emphasize that product output, quality, cost, and production safety are integrated in enterprise work, and no one should be neglected. Criticize various erroneous ideas that ignore quality. At the same time, prevent the one-sided practice of disregarding the amount of raw material consumption and disregarding product costs due to emphasizing "improving quality." Encourage enterprise leaders and production workers to pay attention to quality; when assessing the enterprise production plan, it is necessary to assess the completion of quality indicators and use this as one of the main bases for extracting enterprise reward funds; when promoting piece-rate wages, the quality of products should be used as the main basis for calculating wage quotas; and stipulate reward methods for units or individuals who have made outstanding achievements in improving product quality and increasing variety and color, and implement them effectively.

Can it be said that the poor quality of some products is unrelated to the backward enterprise management and weak technical leadership? It cannot be said that, it is closely related.

First of all, it is manifested in the unsound technical management system. Some products (such as fountain pens, knitwear, enamelware, etc.) do not have quality standards, or the quality standards need to be revised and supplemented; some products (such as some new drugs, etc.) lack instructions on storage time and usage methods.

Many enterprises have poorly implemented process regulations. Some do not produce according to the formula, some do not control the temperature and humidity well, and some do not follow the operating procedures. When making soap, solid oil is sometimes used too much and sometimes used too little, resulting in inconsistent hardness of the soap. The formula of some rubber shoes is inappropriate, and the vulcanization time and temperature are not well controlled, which affects the quality. Cigarettes are sometimes baked too hot, too dry, and there are too many crumbs. The oil extraction temperature is sometimes too high, and the oil cake is焦. Some colored cloths are over-rolled and over-stretched, resulting in excessive shrinkage; the dye formula of some colored cloths is inappropriate, or the dyeing and finishing process regulations are not well mastered, resulting in the colored cloth being unstable and the color being bad.

Many enterprises have done a poor job in technical supervision. Some have inspected the finished products, but rarely inspect the semi-finished products and raw materials. Some do not have complete inspection items and unscientific methods when inspecting the finished products, and the instruments are not complete. They only rely on seeing with their eyes, touching with their hands, and smelling with their noses. Often the results of the same product inspection are different from person to person and time to time. A few inspectors are irresponsible in their work, and often miss inspections, treating substandard products as good products.

Weak technical leadership is also related to insufficient technical strength. In local state-owned joint state-private and private industries, technical strength is particularly lacking. The responsible personnel in various provinces and cities have reflected this difficulty. They believe that local industrial production has been developing rapidly in recent years, but the number of college graduates has increased very little.

The backwardness of other aspects of enterprise management, such as improper preparation of many operation plans; frequent overtime work and rush work; failure to repair machinery and equipment on time; poor management of raw materials and semi-finished products, etc., will directly or indirectly affect product quality.

According to these actual situations and some existing experiences, in order to fundamentally reverse the phenomenon of quality decline of some products, it is necessary to strengthen technical leadership and effectively rectify enterprise production technology work. Relevant departments should separately classify products, limit the time to revise and formulate product standards, raw material formulas, and process regulations, and require strict implementation. It is necessary to add necessary inspection instruments, enrich inspection institutions, and strengthen the inspection of raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products. Unqualified semi-finished products are not allowed to be put into the next process; products that are harmful to health (such as bad medicines, unclean food, etc.) are not allowed to leave the factory. It is necessary to unite and use technical personnel well. Actively create conditions to establish a chief engineer system, and give full play to the leading role and active role of the chief engineer and various professional technical personnel in production technology.

It is necessary to strengthen experimental research work. On the one hand, the scientific experimental research institutions of the light industry department should study and solve the key problems in the quality of existing products; on the other hand, as the people's requirements for the specifications and colors of light industry products are increasing, they should constantly design and trial-produce durable, practical, and beautiful new products. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the existing industrial experimental research institutions, formulate industrial research plans, and solve the difficulties of equipment, talents, and materials in experimental research work. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the work of technological and artistic design in order to change the current monotonous and backward situation in patterned fabrics, ceramics and enamel paintings, shoe styles, etc. Strengthen the connection with scientific and artistic work agencies and obtain their regular assistance. The Ministry of Higher Education should consider appropriately increasing the proportion of light industry departments in universities and colleges, and appropriately take care of the needs of light industry when distributing university graduates.

In addition to the direct relationship between raw materials and production and the quality of some products, some people say that sales work also has a close relationship with the quality of light industry products. I think this opinion also has a certain reason.

In the past, a method of unified purchase and exclusive sales by commercial departments was implemented for many light industry products. This method is necessary and beneficial under certain conditions. But it also produced some side effects, that is, because production departments are not directly responsible to consumers, they often do not feel deeply about the quality, variety, and sales of their products, and they do not care enough. Therefore, it is necessary to study and improve the product sales methods in the future on the basis of the existing system in a planned way, in order to promote production departments to be more concerned about the quality and sales of their products and enhance their responsibility to consumers. At the same time, we should also closely contact the masses and often listen to consumers' opinions and criticisms on product quality. Commercial departments should strengthen the trial sales of new products, regularly and timely provide consumers' feedback to industrial departments, and strictly supervise and inspect factories on product quality issues, regularly hold product quality exhibitions, and conduct quality competitions; attach importance to mass letters on quality issues, and seriously handle them; often send people to visit users; invite relevant people from all parties to participate in product quality appraisal symposiums. Past experience has proved that these methods are very effective in urging and improving product quality.

In order to promote the improvement and improvement of product quality, we believe that we should implement the principle of price differentiation based on product quality, and implement the principle of high price for high quality and low price for substandard products. Generally, the current product quality standards for textiles and daily necessities can be used as the basis for current prices. If the product quality is higher than the current standard, the price should be increased accordingly, and if the product quality is lower than the current standard, the price should be reduced accordingly. This can not only maintain the current price level, but also encourage the improvement of product quality. This measure, we hope that industrial and commercial departments will negotiate and select several commodities for trial implementation first. At the same time, for some products with poor quality, it must be improved within a time limit; if there are no conditions for improvement, it should be considered to be eliminated.

In last year's product quality inspection, we saw that the quality decline of some private factories and handicrafts was more serious than that of state-owned factories, but we also saw that the quality, variety, and color of some private factories and handicrafts were not worse than those of state-owned factories. Some of them are even better than state-owned factories. Many famous brands that are loved by the people are produced by these private factories. Therefore, all localities must pay attention to preserving and promoting their advantages and characteristics when carrying out socialist transformation and production reorganization of private industry and handicrafts. China's handicraft industry has a long history. It not only produces various products for the production and life needs of the broad masses of people, but also can manufacture high-level and world-renowned advanced works of art. We must preserve and carry forward this national heritage. The current high tide of handicraft cooperation is basically healthy, and the production of most handicrafts has risen after cooperation. However, in some regions, in some industries, regardless of specific conditions, production is concentrated and profits and losses are calculated in a unified manner too early and too hastily, and large cooperatives are blindly established, so that production is difficult, residents are inconvenient, supply and marketing are imbalanced, cooperation is interrupted, and output and quality decline, and the variety and color are reduced. As a result, the income of cooperative members is reduced, and life is difficult. We believe that these deviations and new problems that have occurred in the cooperation of handicrafts must be gradually resolved to ensure that the income of cooperative members is not reduced, and that they can gradually increase the income of cooperative members on the basis of improving production, so that they maintain a high degree of enthusiasm to improve product quality and increase variety and color to meet the needs of the people.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have clearly pointed out that 1956 should become a year of outstanding achievements in improving product quality and increasing product variety and color. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, relying on the joint efforts of all employees and capitalists, this instruction can definitely be realized.

    国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫的发言
    我国轻工业还有相当大的生产潜力——某些轻工业产品的质量下降的主要原因是什么？——必须强调产品产量、质量、成本和生产安全四位一体的思想——必须加强企业管理和技术领导——科学试验研究机构要研究产品质量的关键问题——促进生产部门关心自己产品的销路实行按产品质量分等论价——切实注意发扬手工业的优点
    现在我想就轻工业方面特别是有关产品质量的情况和问题，发表一些意见。
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议到这次会议期间，我国国内情况起了一个根本的变化，在农业、手工业和资本主义工商业中掀起了社会主义改造的高潮，取得了决定性的胜利，这就为轻工业的发展开辟了无限广阔的道路。大家知道，原料和销路是轻工业发展的两个基本条件，而轻工业的原料和销路则大部分在农村，因此，对农业实行社会主义改造的结果，无疑地将使轻工业获得日益增多的原料和不断扩大的市场。像以往几年特别是1955年某些轻工业生产在原料供应和产品销售上所遇到的困难，今后将会大大减少。当然，在有原料有销路的条件下，还要有相应的生产能力。实际状况指明，我国轻工业还有相当大的生产潜力，特别是在占有全国轻工业产值一半以上的原有私营企业、公私合营企业和广大的手工业方面，潜力更大。对资本主义工商业和手工业实行社会主义改造的结果，就有可能在国家统一规划下，全面地合理地发挥这些生产潜力，再加上某些必要的改建、扩建和新建，就能够消化农业增产的原料，生产更多的产品供应市场。同时轻工业的发展还能为国家又多又快地积累建设资金，有利于又多又快地发展重工业。
    当我们讲到发展轻工业的有利条件的时候，还应该特别指出广大职工群众的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性的空前高涨这个事实。还在1955年内，为了克服由于农业原料供应紧张在轻工业生产方面所遇到的困难，全国广大职工群众在党和政府的号召下，展开了增产节约运动，取得了很大的成绩。例如：油脂工业在提高出油率和开辟新油源方面，原先提出增产十万吨植物油的任务，经过努力，完成了十三万吨。纺织工业在节约用棉增产纱布方面，酿酒工业在提高出酒率节约粮食方面，以及其他行业在提高出品率、节约原材料方面，也都收到了不同程度的效果。
    1955年的农业丰收，为1956年轻工业生产准备了良好的物质基础，而农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮，又极大地鼓舞了广大职工的生产热情和资方人员的积极性。因此，1956年一月以来，轻工业各厂相继出现了汹涌澎湃的增产运动的高涨。丰收加上高涨这就是1956年第一季度极大部分轻工业产品都能超额完成生产计划的基本原因。而1956年全年轻工业的产值将比1955年增长17％左右。1956年4月间，纺织工业和轻工业先后召开了先进生产者代表会议，约有1，500名先进生产者参加了会议，集中了600多项先进经验，正在组织交流和推广。这对于争取提前完成轻工业的第一个五年计划是有重要意义和作用的。
    但是，必须指出，在某些轻工业产品的质量和品种方面，还赶不上产量发展的要求和人民生活的需要，还存在着相当严重的问题。1955年轻工业产品质量情况，大致可分三类：第一类是部分产品的质量比1954年一般有所提高，如制糖、大部分机制纸张、药品中的磺胺噻唑、特种轮胎的帘子布、某些绸布、出口布、毛纺织品、部分印染布的花色，以及皮革、陶瓷等，其中仅印花布增加新的花色即有两千多种；第二类是部分产品的质量原来就不好，1955年虽有若干改进，但仍存在很多问题，如肉类罐头、部分药品等；第三类是相当的一部分产品质量有不同程度的下降，有的则较严重，例如：某些食品、卷烟、药品、纱布、胶鞋、搪瓷、热水瓶、金笔、火柴、肥皂等，还存在着若干的质量问题：有些饮酒混浊、味淡，群众反映“是醋不酸，是酒不辣”；少数药片“顽固不化”；不少卷烟烟支偏松、偏细，烟味刺鼻、呛喉；部分棉布次布率上升，群众把它叫做“芝麻布”，部分色布缩水率大，部分花布颜色不牢固，有所谓“落花有意，流水无情”；某些质量不好的热水瓶群众称它是“冷瓶”、“定时炸弹”；有的金笔笔杆变形、笔尖粗、漏水，群众反映是“流鼻涕”；有的香皂是“皮香肉不香”。
    应该指出，这些严重的质量情况，在1955年第三季度中共中央和国务院指示改进产品质量以后，已经引起了各方面的重视，进行了全面的检查，对某些质量下降的产品，采取了具体的措施，得到了不少的改进。根据上海、天津等九个省市对质量检查的统计，除了一部分质量基本上稳定的产品以外，今年第一季度较去年第四季度产品质量提高的，约有260种；但下降的仍有130种。可见轻工业产品质量情况，一面虽有显著的改进和提高，一面仍有继续下降的趋势，必须继续努力，求得全面改进。
    为什么某些轻工业产品发生质量下降的现象呢？应当采取什么办法来扭转质量下降的现象呢？
    有人说，是原料供应不足，原料质量低劣或品种多变，影响了某些产品质量的提高和稳定。我们认为这种说法不是没有一定的理由，因为原料的多少和好坏，对于某些产品质量的影响，确实很大。以棉花为例，过去几年每年第四季和下年第一季原棉质量较好，棉纱质量也就好些；下年第二、三季度原棉质量下降，棉纱质量也就随之下降。轻工业生产中，有些原料
  （如烟叶等）和产品（如白酒）需要存一个时间，经过自然变化，才能提高质量，但由于供应紧张，工商库存一再压缩，低级、次等原料用得过多，也影响了质量。某些进口原料（如染布的颜料、做金笔尖的铱金和做笔杆的塑料等）和商业部门统配的原料（如棉花和油脂）的品种规格时常变化，也影响操作和质量。这些都是事实，我们必须看到这一点，并且应该采取一些必要和可能的办法来改善原料供应的情况。
    首先，在原料调拨方面，要求根据目前的原料状况，加以合理调用，逐步改变过去原料供应忽好忽坏的情况，尽可能地做到根据不同的产品相应地调配原料。例如：高支纱和低支纱，饮料酒精和工业、卫生用酒精，食用植物油和制肥皂的植物油等，在原料要求上都有很大的区别，如果能够更加合理的调拨，就有可能逐步改变高级产品用低级原料和低级产品用高级原料的不合理情况。其次，要求逐步改善原料的质量，减少原料中的杂质。为了逐步做到这一点，生产部门和采购、供应部门可以经过协议，规定原料的含杂标准；并且在以后有计划地逐步改进原料的加工和分级工作。应该看到，改进原料的品种、质量和采购调拨工作是一件十分复杂的工作。是需要生产部门和商业部门共同努力才能做好的。商业采购部门这几年来在种种困难条件下已经对改善原料的采购和调拨做了许多工作。因此，上述工作，只能是按照需要和可能的条件，逐步求得解决。
    但是，原料的多少和好坏，并不是某些轻工业产品质量下降的唯一原因，甚至不是主要的原因。事实上，造成某些产品质量下降的，还有另外一些原因，这些原因，比起原料问题来，我认为是更主要的。这就是有些工业部门和企业对产品质量的忽视和技术管理工作的薄弱。
    我们从各部门和各地区对产品质量检查的结果来看，首先是暴露了一部分同志，在思想上存在着片面观点和不重视质量的观点，把增产节约和提高质量对立起来。这是造成某些轻工业产品质量下降的主要原因之一。
    当我们在贯彻增产节约指示的时候，一般虽然提出了“在保证质量的前提下努力增产、厉行节约”，但是，保证质量的要求和措施，往往不具体，而增产节约则有数字指标。有些同志对于生产是为了满足日益增长的群众需要的重要意义认识不足，因之在增产节约运动中就忽视了产品的质量。若干轻工业产品在市场需要很大而原料供应不足时，采取了改变配方，减少用料，找代用原料等等措施，这是必要的，有不少是做得对的，是得到了增产节约的经济效果而又不损害产品质量的，但也有不少是片面节约，损害了质量的。为什么有的卷烟烟支偏轻呢？就是因为层层克扣用烟量的定额。为什么上海某些浅色花布色泽不鲜艳呢？就是因为普遍降低了染化料20％左右。为什么有些针剂用的玻璃管，耐碱、耐酸、耐热的效能降低呢？就是因为减少氧化铝和硼砂的用量。为什么有的风琴发音不正确，有的还不能发音呢？就是因为用锌合金制造的琴簧代替了铜的琴簧。棉纺工业对原料的杂质处理上，注意了“不浪费可纺纤维”，但是有的工厂就降低了除杂效率，增加了纱布的含杂。卷烟工业中注意了“梗中不带叶”，但是有的工厂就忽视了“叶中不带梗”。除杂不净，必然会影响产品质量。有的产品，由于“简化”包装，缩短了有效的存放期。上海国营食品厂的光明牌代乳粉，原来瓶装很好，改成纸盒装后，容易受潮、结块。所有这些，都说明片面的节约原料和不适当的使用代用品是不对的。
    从这里，我们应该得出教训。那就是必须在广大职工中进行继续贯彻增产节约和提高产品质量的思想教育工作。强调在企业工作中产品产量、质量、成本和生产安全，四位一体，不可偏废，批判各种忽视质量的错误思想。同时防止由于强调“提高质量”而产生不顾原料消耗多少和不计产品成本的片面的做法。鼓励企业领导干部和生产工人重视质量；在考核企业生产计划的时候，必须考核质量指标的完成情况，以此作为提取企业奖励基金的主要根据之一；在推行计件工资的时候，产品质量的好坏，应当作为工资定额计算的主要根据之一；并且规定对提高产品质量和增加品种花色卓著成绩的单位或个人的奖励办法，切实执行。
    能否说，某些产品质量的低劣，是与企业管理落后和技术领导薄弱无关的呢？不能这样说，是密切相关的。
    首先表现在技术管理制度不健全。有些产品（如金笔、针织、搪瓷等）尚无质量标准，或者是质量标准需要修正和补充；有些产品（如某些新药等）尚缺少保管时间和使用方法的说明。
    不少企业，对工艺规程，贯彻执行得很差。有的不按照配方投料生产，有的不很好控制温湿度，有的不遵守操作规程。制造肥皂时，固体油有时多用，有时少用，造成肥皂软硬不一。有些胶鞋的配方不当，硫化时间和温度控制不好，影响质量。卷烟有时烤烘太热，偏干，碎屑多。榨油温度有的过高，油饼发焦。有的色布多轧、多拉，以致缩水过大；有的色布，染料配方不当，或染整工艺规程掌握不好，致使色布不结实、色泽不好。
    不少企业，技术监督工作作得很差。有的对成品进行了检验，但很少对半成品和原料进行检验，有的对成品检验时，检验项目不完全，方法不科学，而仪器也不完备，只凭眼看、手摸、鼻子闻，往往相同的产品，检验的结果，却因人因时而不一样。少数检验人员工作不负责任，经常发生漏检现象，把次等产品当作好产品。
    技术领导薄弱也是和技术力量不足有关的。在地方国营公私合营和私营工业中，技术力量特别感到不足，各省市主管业务人员都反映了这方面的困难。他们认为这几年来地方工业的生产日益发展，而大专毕业生却增加得很少。
    企业管理其他方面的工作落后，例如不少作业计划编制不当；经常加班加点，突击赶工；机器设备不按时检修；原料和半成品管理不好等，都会直接地或间接地影响产品质量。
    根据这些实际情况和一些已有的经验来看，要从根本上扭转某些产品质量下降的现象，必须加强技术领导，切实整顿企业生产技术工作。有关部门应该分别产品，限期修订和制定产品标准、原料配方和工艺规程，并要求严格执行。必须增添必要的检验仪器，充实检验机构，加强对原料和半成品、成品的检验工作。不合格的半成品，不准投入下一工序；有害健康的产品（如坏药、不干净的食品等）不准出厂。必须很好地团结和使用技术人员。积极创造条件建立总工程师制度，充分发挥总工程师以及各专业技术人员在生产技术方面的领导作用和积极作用。
    必须加强试验研究工作。轻工业部门的科学试验研究机构一方面要研究解决现有产品质量上的关键问题；另一方面，随着人民对轻工业产品的规格和花色的要求日益增高，要不断地设计和试制耐久、适用、美观的新产品。因此必须加强现有的工业试验研究机构，制定工业研究计划，解决试验研究工作中的设备、人才和资料的困难。此外，还要加强工艺美术设计工作，以改变目前在花布、陶瓷和搪瓷彩绘、鞋子式样等方面的单调、落后状况。密切和科学、美术工作机关的联系，并取得他们的经常的帮助。高教部应该考虑在高等学校中适当增加轻工业系科的比重，在分配大学毕业生时，适当照顾到轻工业方面的需要。
    除了原料和生产方面对某些产品质量问题有直接的关系以外，有人说，在销售工作方面对轻工业产品质量也有着密切的关系。这种意见，我认为也有它一定的道理的。
    过去对许多轻工业产品实行了由商业部门统购包销的办法。这种办法，在一定条件下，是必要的，也是有好处的。但是也产生了一些副作用，这就是使得生产部门由于它们不是处于直接对消费者负责的地位，往往对自己产品的质量品种和销路感觉不深，关心不够。因此，有必要对今后产品的销售办法在现行制度的基础上，有步骤地加以研究和改进，以促进生产部门更加能够关心自己产品的质量和销路，并增强对消费者的责任。同时，还应当密切联系群众，经常倾听消费者对产品质量的意见和批评。商业部门应该加强对新产品的试销工作，经常地及时地向工业部门提供消费者的反映，并对工厂在产品质量问题上进行严格的督促和检查，定期举行产品质量展览会，进行质量评比；重视有关质量问题的群众来信，并且认真加以处理；经常派人向用户访问；邀请各方面有关人士参加产品质量的鉴定座谈会。过去经验证明，这些办法都是对督促和提高产品质量有很大的作用。
    为了促进产品质量的改进和提高，我们认为应当实行按产品质量分等论价，贯彻优质价高，次品价低的原则。一般可以目前纺织和日用品的产品质量标准作为现行价格的基础，产品质量高于现行标准者，相应提价，低于现行标准者，相应降价，这样既可以保持现行的物价水平，又可以鼓励提高产品质量。这一措施，希望工业和商业部门进行协商，先选择若干商品试行。同时，对于某些质量不好的产品，必须限期改进；实在没有改进条件的，应该考虑加以淘汰。
    在去年产品质量检查中我们看到有些私营工厂和手工业的产品质量下降的情况比国营工厂还严重，但也看到有些私营工厂和手工业的产品质量、品种和花色方面，并不比国营厂差，有的还比国营厂好，有许多为人民所喜爱的名牌货，就是这些私营工厂生产的，因此，各地对私营工业和手工业进行社会主义改造和生产改组时，必须切实注意保存和发扬它们这方面的优点和特点。我国手工业有悠久的历史，它不仅为广大人民的生产和生活需要生产各种产品，而且能够制造技艺很高、闻名世界的高级艺术作品。这一民族遗产，我们必须保存下来，发扬光大。这次手工业合作化高潮基本上是健康的，大多数手工业在合作化后的生产是上升的。但是，有些地区在某些行业中，不顾具体条件，过早过急地集中生产和统一计算盈亏，盲目地办大社，并大社，以致生产困难，居民不便，供销失调，协作中断，产量、质量下降，品种花色减少。因而社员收入减少，生活发生困难。我们认为手工业在合作化中所发生的这些偏差和新的问题，都必须逐步加以解决，保证合作社社员的收入不减少，并且能够在提高生产的基础上逐步提高社员的收入，使他们保持高度的积极性来改进产品质量，增加品种花色，以适应人民的需要。
    中共中央和国务院曾经明确指出：1956年应当成为在提高产品质量和增加产品品种花色方面，做出卓越成绩的一年。我们相信在党和政府的领导之下，依靠全体职工和资方人员的共同努力，这个指示是一定可以实现的。
