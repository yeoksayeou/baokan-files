    "Contention" and Works
    He Qi
    The policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is welcomed and supported by everyone in academic circles. As someone who wants to listen to the "contention," I also have a small voice to raise.
    In the golden age of China's academic history—the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods—it was indeed a time of "contention" among a hundred schools. Each school freely wrote books and established theories, without any concerns or restrictions. Although paper had not yet been invented at that time, a large number of lead characters had not yet been cast, there were no publications or publishing houses, no libraries with book classification methods, and no steel wire recorders to record the "contention" of each school. However, the "contention" of each school was passed down, after all, mainly through their own clumsy methods of engraving or writing on bamboo slips with lacquer, or through oral transmission from teachers to disciples, and disciples to their disciples, so that we, thousands of years later, can still think of the lively situation at that time based on the records.
    Now, publications, publishing houses, and libraries are all available, which should be even more conducive to the dissemination and preservation of the "contention" of each school. However, in recent years, the cultural circles have somehow developed such a code of conduct that once someone is criticized (sometimes this criticism is not necessarily correct, or even completely wrong), publications are unwilling to publish the criticized person's manuscripts, publishing houses are unwilling to publish his works, and bookstores are unwilling to sell his books. Some libraries simply remove the registration cards and list them as banned books. The result? The criticized person remains silent, and others no longer mention or pay attention to him. Everything seems to be set in stone. Readers who want to read the criticized works can only regret their lack of opportunity.
    Moreover, this is really unfair. For example, in wrestling, three matches are required to determine the winner. If only one side is seen to have lost once, or slightly faltered, and is immediately treated as the loser and kicked out of the arena, the audience will not be convinced. Moreover, academic debate is different from wrestling. Only seeing someone criticized and being treated as the loser and kicked out of the arena, never allowed to come again, not even having a foothold, how can they continue to "contend"? If this trend continues, the future of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is somewhat predictable. Perhaps it will start with a hundred schools rising up at once, but before the "contention" even begins, it will be beaten down by this code of conduct, leaving ninety-nine schools, eighty-eight schools, seventy-seven schools... until finally there is only one school singing alone.
    Without breaking this code of conduct, it is difficult to guarantee that each school can smoothly produce works for long-term "contention." Even if a school really has a tenacious will and can imitate the schools of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods to engrave books and write with lacquer, a large number of engraving knives, bamboo slips, and high-quality lacquer may not be so easy to obtain. Therefore, those works cannot be disseminated for "contention."
    This trend has not been completely broken at present, and my small voice seems to be not superfluous.

### “争鸣”和著作

    “争鸣”和著作
    何弃
    “百家争鸣”的方针，是学术界人人欢迎拥护的。作为一个想听“鸣”者，我却也有一点小小的呼声。
    在我国学术史上的黄金时代——春秋战国时代，的确是百家在“争鸣”。各家自由地著书立说，毫无顾虑和限制。虽然，当时纸还没发明，大量的铅字也没铸好，既没有刊物和出版社，也没有按某某氏分类法藏书的图书馆，更没有钢丝录音机把各家的“鸣”声录下来。但是，各家的“鸣”声毕竟是传下来了，不外是自己用笨拙的法子把著作用刀刻或者用漆写在竹板上，或者是由老师口授弟子，弟子再传弟子，使几千年后的我们，还能够凭记录想到当时的热闹情况。
    现在，刊物、出版社、图书馆都有了，本来是应该更有利于传播和保留各家的“鸣”声的。但是，几年来，文化界不知怎么一来，有了那么一条清规戒律，有人一被批评（有时这批评还不一定对，甚至根本错误），刊物就不愿再登被批评者的稿子，出版社不愿再出他的著作，书店也不愿再卖他的书了。有的图书馆则干脆抽去登记卡片，列入禁书。结果呢？被批评者沉默不言了，别人也再不提不理他了，一切都似乎盖棺论定。读者想再看被批评的著作，只能自恨无缘。
    而且这也实在欠公平。譬如摔跤吧，三次才可决胜负，如果只看一方败了一次，或稍一失脚，就被当作败者赶出场，观众是不会心服的。何况，学术争论又不同于摔跤，只看谁一被批评，就被当作败者逐出场外，永不准再来，连立足之地都没有了，又怎么可能继续“争鸣”呢？如果这风气继续存在下去，“百家争鸣”的前途是略可想见的，也许一开始是百家一轰而起，还没等到“争鸣”，就会先被这种清规戒律打得剩下九十九家，八十八家，七十七家……最后只剩下一家独唱。
    不打破这条清规戒律，是很难保证各家都能顺利地拿出著作来长期地“争鸣”的。即使哪一家真有顽强的意志，可以仿春秋战国各家去刻书、漆书，而大量的刻字刀、竹板和上等漆，也都未必那样容易得到。因此，那些著作也就无法传出去“争鸣”。
    这种风气目前并没彻底打破，我这小小的呼声看来还不是多余的。
