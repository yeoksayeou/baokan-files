    Welcome the French "Labor Union" Basketball Team
    Zhang Lianhua, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Sports Federation
    The first French sports team to visit our country—the basketball team of the French Labor Sports Federation—has come to visit our country. We extend our heartfelt welcome to these envoys who are here to strengthen mutual understanding and friendship between the people and athletes of China and France!
    I have visited Paris three times, and each time I visited the French Labor Sports Federation (hereinafter referred to as the "Labor Union"), visited their sports facilities and sports competitions, and had close conversations with some of the responsible staff of the Labor Union. Today, we can meet again in Beijing. How happy and pleasant it is!
    We know that the French people and the working class have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the French Labor Union also maintains and carries forward these glorious traditions in sports activities. They have carried out a great deal of work and unremitting struggles to fight for the right of French workers to participate in sports activities and to develop mass sports activities that serve the cause of peace. In 1952, the French ruling group wanted to stifle the existing workers' sports movement and cancelled all state funding to the Labor Union. However, a mass protest wave swept across the country, and ordinary French workers (people with very difficult living conditions) took out their own money as the Labor Union's activity fund. French worker athletes were not intimidated, but united more closely around their sports organization. They often held friendly sports competitions to support workers' strike activities, and used the income from the competitions to subsidize the families of striking workers. It is precisely because the Labor Union is working and fighting tirelessly for the interests of the French working class that they have deep-rooted connections and high prestige with workers across the country.
    If we start counting from the first workers' sports club, the Labor Union already has a glorious history of nearly fifty years. It now has 200,000 members and is the largest sports organization in France. The members of the Labor Union include the masses of various trade unions and unorganized workers. They overcome various difficulties, ensure the necessary equipment, arrange suitable time, and organize workers in urban suburbs to participate in sports activities. They often organize various competitions to attract thousands of worker athletes to participate in physical exercise. For example, in 1952—the year they were deprived of state funding—they organized 33 national championships, including more than 3,000 participants in gymnastics competitions; organized more than 30 competitions between workers' sports clubs, with more than 600 participants; and organized 49 international competitions, including the traditional "L'Humanité" cross-country championship alone, with 6,000 participants. The Labor Union's various activities have achieved great success, and have cultivated new types of athletes and sports workers, such as the world race walking champion Gallon, the French cycling champion Tréda, and Bousson, who once broke the world record in the 100-meter backstroke, all of whom were trained by the French Labor Union. Three of the six main players in the French national volleyball team are members of the Labor Union.
    The Labor Union has also done a lot of outstanding work in striving for friendship among the people of various countries. They often organize and participate in various international competitions. In 1954 and 1955, they received sports teams (including 14 projects, more than 390 people) from 12 countries including the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Democratic Germany, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, and Belgium. The Labor Union also sent 369 people from 15 projects to visit Belgium, Democratic Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and other countries, and sent 110 representatives to participate in the World Youth Festival competition. At the festival, Chinese athletes had friendly competitions with Labor Union athletes more than once. Undoubtedly, these activities have greatly promoted understanding and friendship between the French people and the people of various countries.
    French basketball has a high reputation internationally. At the Olympic Games held in Helsinki in 1952, the French basketball team won eighth place. The Labor Union's basketball players often achieve excellent results in French basketball competitions. For example, this year, the Labor Union's Ivry women's basketball team won the French basketball championship. The Labor Union women's basketball team visiting our country this time is very strong, including five excellent athletes from the Ivry team. The team's captain, Zierfan, and the famous Rogues sisters have all come to our country. The men's team is also an excellent team that often participates in the French championship competition. We firmly believe that these friends from the Labor Union basketball team, who have the fine traditions of the French working class and have high achievements in basketball, will not only bring the friendship of the French people, but also will definitely make wonderful performances and leave a deep impression on Chinese audiences.

### 欢迎法国“劳联”篮球队

    欢迎法国“劳联”篮球队
    中华全国体育总会常务委员　张联华
    第一个来我国访问的法国运动队——法国劳动体育联合会篮球队来到我国访问了。我们向这些为了加强中法两国人民和运动员之间相互了解和友谊的使者们，表示衷心的欢迎！
    我曾经三次访问过巴黎，每次都要访问法国劳动体育联合会（以下简称劳联），参观他们的体育设备和运动比赛，还和劳联的一些负责工作人员作亲密的交谈。今天，我们又能够在北京见面，该是多么令人高兴和愉快的事啊！
    我们知道，法国人民和工人阶级有着光荣的革命传统，法国劳联在体育活动中也保持和发扬着这些光荣的传统。他们为了争取法国工人参加体育运动的权利，为了开展群众性的、服务于和平事业的体育运动，进行了许许多多的工作和始终不渝的斗争。1952年，法国统治集团想扼杀已有的工人体育运动，取消了政府给劳联的一切国家资助。但是，全国掀起了群众性的抗议浪潮，法国的普通工人们
  （生活条件很困难的人们），拿出了自己的钱来作为劳联的活动基金。法国工人运动员们没有被吓倒，而是更加紧密地团结在自己体育组织的周围。他们也常常为了支援工人的罢工活动举行友谊的体育比赛，用比赛的收入来补助罢工工人的家庭。正是由于劳联为了法国工人阶级的利益，进行着不遗余力的工作和斗争，因此，他们同全国工人有着根深柢固的联系和很高的威信。
    如果从有第一个工人体育俱乐部算起，劳联已经有近五十年的光荣历史，它现在有二十万会员，是法国最大的体育组织。劳联的会员有各种倾向的工会的群众和没有组织的工人群众。他们克服着各种困难，保证必要的器材，安排合适的时间，组织城市郊区的工人去进行体育活动。他们经常组织各种比赛来吸引成千上万的工人运动员参加体育锻炼。比如在1952年——也就是他们被剥夺了国家资助的那年，他们组织过三十三次全国性的锦标赛，其中参加体操比赛的就有三千多人；组织了三十多次工人体育俱乐部之间的比赛，参加的有六百多人；还组织过四十九次国际比赛，其中仅传统性的“人道报”越野锦标赛一项，就有六千人参加。劳联各种各样的活动获得了巨大的成就，培养了新型的运动员和体育工作者，像世界竞走冠军加隆，法国自行车运动的冠军特来达，曾经打破世界一百公尺仰泳纪录的鲍颂，都是法国劳联培养出来的。在法国国家排球队六个主力队员里就有三个是劳联的会员。
    劳联在争取各国人民友好方面也做了许多杰出的工作，他们经常组织和参加各种国际比赛。在1954和1955两年里，他们接待了到法国访问的苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、意大利、奥地利、瑞士、芬兰、比利时等十二个国家的运动队（包括十四个项目，三百九十多人）。劳联也派出了十五个项目的369人到比利时、民主德国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士等国访问，并且派出了一百一十个代表参加了世界青年联欢节的比赛。在联欢节上，中国运动员不止一次地和劳联运动员进行了友好的比赛。无疑的，这些活动对于促进法国人民和各国人民之间的了解和友谊是有很大作用的。
    法国的篮球运动在国际上有很高的声誉。在1952年赫尔辛基举行的奥林匹克运动会上，法国篮球队获得第八名。劳联的篮球运动员在法国的篮球比赛中经常获得优异的成绩，例如，今年全法篮球冠军赛中，劳联的依弗里市的女子篮球队获得了冠军。这次来我国访问的劳联女子篮球队的实力是很强的，其中有依弗里队的五名优秀运动员。这个队的队长紫而凡球和著名的罗格三姊妹都来到了我国。男子队也是经常参加法国冠军争夺战的优秀选手。我们深信，这些具有法国工人阶级优良传统、在篮球运动上又有很高成就的劳联篮球队的朋友们，不但带来了法国人民的友谊，而且一定会作出精彩的表演，给中国观众们留下一个深刻的印象。
