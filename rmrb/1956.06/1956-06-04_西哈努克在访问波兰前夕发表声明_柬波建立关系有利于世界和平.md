Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: According to a report from the Polish Press Agency in Paris on the 2nd, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, who is about to visit Poland, issued a statement saying, "It is with gratitude and excitement that I have accepted the kind invitation of the Polish government. I am eagerly preparing for my journey to Warsaw, where I hope to witness firsthand the brilliant achievements of the Polish people in their noble struggle to rebuild their country and ensure its proper development, achievements that will guarantee the happiness of the Polish people and contribute to the maintenance of world peace."

Sihanouk made this statement when he met with a Polish Press Agency reporter in Paris. He said that although Cambodia and Poland are geographically far apart, "we understand the commendable great virtues and courage of the Polish people."

Sihanouk also said that Cambodia is a neutral country, and its neutrality stems from the fact that it hopes to contribute, to the best of its modest ability, to the cause of understanding, agreement, and friendship between all countries and all peoples on our planet; only this kind of understanding, agreement, and friendship can lay a solid foundation for peace, which is so indispensable to the prosperity and happiness of mankind.

Sihanouk emphasized that Cambodia is very grateful to Poland for legally recognizing its independence. "I hope that my visit, as well as the diplomatic, political, economic, and cultural relations that have been established and will be established between our two countries, will be beneficial to the cause of our two countries and the cause of world peace."

    西哈努克在访问波兰前夕发表声明
    柬波建立关系有利于世界和平
    新华社3日讯　据波兰通讯社巴黎二日讯：即将到波兰访问的柬埔寨王国前首相西哈努克亲王发表声明说，我在怀着感谢和激动的心情答应波兰政府的盛意邀请。我迫不及待地准备着到华沙去的旅程，我希望能够在那里亲眼看看波兰人民在重建他们的国家和确保它有适当的发展水平的崇高斗争中所获得的辉煌成就，这些成就将成为波兰人民的幸福的保证，并且将是对维持世界和平的贡献。
    西哈努克是在巴黎接见波兰通讯社记者的时候发表这篇声明的。他说，从地理上看，虽然柬埔寨同波兰相距很远，但是，我们了解波兰人民的值得称颂的伟大品德和勇敢。
    西哈努克还说，柬埔寨是一个中立国家，它之所以中立是由于这样一个事实：它希望以它的微薄的能力，对各国之间、我们地球上的一切人民之间的谅解、协议和友爱的事业有所贡献；只有这种谅解、协议和友爱，才能够为对人类的繁荣和幸福说来是如此不可缺少的和平奠定一个巩固的基础。
    西哈努克着重说，柬埔寨非常感谢波兰在法律上承认了它的独立。我希望我的访问以及我们两国之间已经建立的和将要建立的外交上、政治上、经济上和文化上的关系，将有利于我们两国的事业和世界和平事业。
