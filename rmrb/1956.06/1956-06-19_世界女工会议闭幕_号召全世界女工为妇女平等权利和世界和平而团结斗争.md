Xinhua News Agency, Budapest dispatch: The World Women Workers' Conference closed in Budapest on June 17. By the time of the closing, approximately 500 delegates from 42 countries had participated in the conference.
    During the four-day meeting, delegates listened to and discussed the report by Gille, secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, on women workers' unanimous struggle for social and political rights, and the report by Japanese representative Tsuneo Ide, on women workers' active participation in trade union life and trade union leadership. Almost all national representatives participating in the conference expressed their opinions on these two reports during the discussions.
    The conference unanimously adopted the following three documents: General Resolution, Memorandum from the World Women Workers' Conference to the Chairman of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization, and Appeal to Women Workers Worldwide.
    The General Resolution stated: This conference conducted a wide exchange of opinions and experiences in struggle, and formulated recommendations, which demonstrates a significant increase in the class consciousness of women workers, giving us the greatest hope.
    The conference congratulated the women workers of socialist countries on their achievements. In these countries, women are equal to men in terms of labor remuneration and in all aspects of economic, political, and social life.
    After hearing many speeches introducing the situation of their working partners, the representatives believed that in order to meet their urgent demands, everyone must engage in unyielding struggle.
    The World Women Workers' Conference welcomes various forms of cooperation between trade unions of various countries, especially cooperation to improve the situation of women workers.
    In a memorandum decided to be submitted to the International Labour Organization, the conference stated the basic demands of women workers. It then made some recommendations to the organization, including continuing to strive for more countries to ratify the International Labor Convention No. 100, which establishes the principle of "equal pay for equal work."
    The Appeal to Women Workers Worldwide stated that the principle of "equal pay for equal work" is in line with the overall interests of all working people, and women workers should receive the same wages as male workers. Women workers also demand an end to all forms of discrimination against them in employment, promotion, skill level, and dismissal, and above all demand the establishment of women workers' labor rights. Women workers can no longer tolerate work methods and working days that exhaust them physically and mentally.
    The Appeal to Women Workers Worldwide finally called on women workers to fight to stop the manufacture and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, for disarmament, for peace, for active participation in trade union life and trade union leadership, and for the unity of the working class.

    世界女工会议闭幕
    号召全世界女工为妇女平等权利和世界和平而团结斗争
    新华社据塔斯社布达佩斯讯　世界女工会议六月十七日在布达佩斯闭幕。到闭幕时止，有四十二个国家的约五百名代表参加了这次会议。
    在四天的会议中，代表们听取并且讨论了法国总工会书记纪耶所作的关于女工们一致为争取社会和政治权利而斗争的报告和日本代表出牛常关于女工积极参加工会生活和工会领导工作的报告。几乎参加会议的各国代表都在讨论中对这两个报告发表了意见。
    这次会议一致通过了下面三个文件：总决议、世界女工会议给国际劳工组织理事会主席的备忘录和告全世界女工书。
    总决议说：这次会议广泛地交换了意见和斗争经验，制定了建议，这表明女工们的阶级觉悟有了很大提高，使我们产生了最大的希望。
    会议祝贺社会主义国家女工所获得的成就。在这些国家里，妇女在劳动报酬和经济、政治和社会生活各方面是同男子平等的。
    代表们听了许多介绍自己劳动伙伴的境遇的发言后认为，要想满足她们的迫切要求，必须大家都来不屈不挠地进行斗争。
    世界女工会议欢迎各国工会之间各种形式的合作，特别是为了改善女工处境的合作。
    会议在决定向国际劳工组织提出的一项备忘录中，说明了女工的基本要求。然后它向这个组织提出一些建议，包括继续争取更多的国家批准确立“同工同酬”原则的第一百号国际劳动问题公约。
    告全世界女工书说，“同工同酬”的原则是符合全体劳动人民的总的利益的，女工们应该得到同男工一样的工资。女工们还要求结束在就业、升职、熟练程度和解雇方面对她们的种种歧视，并且首先要求确立女工的劳动权利。女工们再也不能忍受使她们在体力上和精神上疲惫不堪的工作方法和工作日。
    告全世界女工书最后号召女工为争取停止制造和使用原子武器和氢武器，为裁减军备，为和平，为积极参加工会生活和工会领导工作，为工人阶级的团结一致而奋斗。
