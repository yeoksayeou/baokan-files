    Soviet Fleet Bids Farewell to Shanghai and Returns Home
    Chekurov Holds Press Conference Before Departure

    (People's Daily Shanghai dispatch, June 26th) The Soviet friendly visit fleet to China bid farewell to Shanghai this morning and set sail for Vladivostok.

    Just after five o'clock, crowds of people came from all directions to the Bund to bid farewell to the Soviet fleet. Among them were Vice Admiral Luo Shunchu, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, Xu Jianguo, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, as well as the Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Osipov, and consular officials from various countries stationed in Shanghai.

    At 5:20 AM, Vice Admiral Chekurov boarded a small boat, disembarked and shook hands with the well-wishers to say goodbye, then walked towards the welcoming crowd to bid farewell. At this moment, cheers and applause rang out from the crowd. With excited hearts, the well-wishers presented him with flowers and greetings, wishing him a smooth journey. When Vice Admiral Chekurov returned to the dock from the crowd, Vice Admiral Luo Shunchu said, "I wish you a safe journey!" Deputy Mayor Xu Jianguo said, "Please convey the friendship of the people of Shanghai to the Soviet people and the Soviet armed forces." Vice Admiral Chekurov said, "As I am about to leave you, please allow me to thank you once again for your sincere and warm hospitality to all the officers and soldiers of our fleet. I wish you greater achievements in socialist construction."

    The time for departure had arrived. The band played the song "Moscow-Beijing" again and again, the Soviet warships raised the colorful flags of "Goodbye, Thank You," and the sailors lined up in neat formations on the decks of the warships. On the bridge of the cruiser "Pozharsky," stood Vice Admiral Chekurov, Commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, and the generals and officers of the visiting fleet. They raised their hands to salute the citizens of Shanghai. As they departed, it suddenly began to rain, but countless flowers, hats, and handkerchiefs waved even more enthusiastically in the rain, and the Soviet sailors' farewell "Hurrahs" continuously echoed from the heavy rain. The Soviet friendly visit fleet to China, carrying the deep affection of the people of Shanghai, slowly left Shanghai port. Rear Admiral Peng Deqing, Deputy Commander of the Chinese Navy's East Sea Fleet, represented the Chinese Navy to see them off. The Chinese Navy frigate "Nanchang" escorted the Soviet fleet all the way out of the Yangtze River estuary and into the vast East China Sea.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 26th: At nearly 2:00 AM on the 26th, three hours before the Soviet fleet left Shanghai, Vice Admiral Chekurov, Commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, held a press conference on the deck of the cruiser "Pozharsky," requesting to bid farewell to the people of Shanghai and all of China through the newspapers. Chekurov thanked the Chinese people for their warm reception. He said, "We hope to have the opportunity to see Shanghai again."

    Prior to this, Chekurov also made a farewell broadcast speech to the people of Shanghai and China.

    苏联舰队告别上海回国
    切库罗夫行前举行记者招待会
    本报上海26日电　苏联友好访华舰队今天早晨告别上海，启航回海参崴。
    五时刚过，和苏联舰队告别的人群就从各处来到外滩。这里有中国人民解放军海军副司令员罗舜初海军中将、上海市副市长许建国，还有苏联驻上海总领事奥西波夫和各国驻上海的领事馆人员。
    五时二十分，切库罗夫海军中将乘坐小艇登岸同欢送者一一握手辞行，然后走向欢送的群众队伍告别。这时，人群中响起了一片欢呼、鼓掌的声音。欢送的人们怀着激动的心情向他献花、问好，祝他一帆风顺。当切库罗夫海军中将从群众队伍中回到码头上的时候，罗舜初海军中将说：“祝你们一路平安！”许建国副市长说：“请你们转达上海人民对苏联人民和苏联武装部队的友情。”切库罗夫海军中将说：“在我即将离开你们的时候，请允许我再一次感谢你们，感谢你们对我们舰队全体官兵的诚恳的热情的招待，我祝大家在社会主义建设中取得更大的成就。”
    离别的时候到了，乐队一次一次地奏起了莫斯科—北京的歌曲，苏联军舰上升起了“再见，谢谢”的彩旗，水兵们在军舰的甲板上排列起整齐的队伍。巡洋舰“波日阿尔斯基”号的舰桥上，站立着苏联太平洋舰队司令切库罗夫海军中将和访华舰队的将军和军官们。他们举手向上海市民致敬。离别时，天忽然下起雨来，但是无数的鲜花、帽子、手帕在雨中挥动得更热烈，苏联军舰上水兵们告别的乌拉声也从大雨中不断传来。苏联友好访华舰队载着上海人民的友爱深情缓缓地离开上海港，中国海军东海舰队副司令彭德清海军少将代表中国海军送行。中国海军“南昌”号护卫舰一直护送苏联舰队驶出长江口，开进浩浩的东海。
    据新华社上海26日电　二十六日凌晨近二时，距苏联舰队离开上海还有三小时，苏联太平洋舰队司令切库罗夫海军中将在“波日阿尔斯基”号巡洋舰的甲板上举行了记者招待会，要求通过报纸向上海和全中国的人民告别。切库罗夫感谢中国人民的热情的接待。他说，我们希望能有机会和上海再见。
    在此以前，切库罗夫还向上海和中国人民作了告别的广播演说。
