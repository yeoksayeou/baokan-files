Hoping for the Early Enactment of Criminal and Civil Law
——Speech by Representative Huang Shaohong

I inspected the procuratorial and judicial work in parts of Shanghai and Zhejiang. I will speak on this aspect.

First, I saw the great victory achieved in the 1955 campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, which dealt another heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary elements. Attracted by the bright prospects of socialism, and inspired by the policy of combining suppression with leniency, the enemy's internal ranks have been shaken and divided. In particular, the promulgation of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" and the implementation of Articles 4 and 5 of the draft have further increased their determination to abandon darkness and turn to the light, and to atone for their crimes by good deeds. Zhejiang Province statistics show that in March of this year, 3,943 people surrendered themselves, and in April, the number increased to 14,947. After studying the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)," prisoners in Shanghai prisons were also most encouraged by Articles 4 and 5, realizing that as long as they actively strive for reform, they will still have a future after serving their sentences. Therefore, their confidence in reform has reached an unprecedented level, and their enthusiasm for labor has greatly increased. They have all put forward guarantees to accelerate their reform. All these prove that the policies of "combining suppression with leniency" and "resistance is met with severity, confession with leniency" are very correct.

However, I feel that the propaganda work on policies and laws in various places is not done enough. For example, after the Hangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate and Public Security Bureau publicly leniently treated Zhang Yi, a Taiwanese secret agent who surrendered to me, 10 counter-revolutionary elements who were still engaged in hidden sabotage activities immediately surrendered themselves. There are many such examples all over the country, but there has not been sufficient and timely publicity. At the same time, I also feel that the policy of "resistance is met with severity, confession with leniency" should be given more practical publicity in peacetime in order to achieve positive and widespread results. If it is overemphasized during the trial or adjudication of certain cases, it may have bad side effects. During my inspection, I saw that some defendants were afraid to defend themselves or appeal because they feared "resistance is met with severity"; some, in order to show their frankness and be treated with leniency, said some things that were irrelevant to the case or were false as a manifestation of frankness; and even individual judges or procurators mistakenly believed that defense or appeal was "resistance", or excessively and subjectively pursued "frankness", thereby delaying the case for a long time, or even causing wrong accusations and judgments.

Secondly, I feel that our country's procuratorial and judicial system is superior, and the quality of the cadres of the procuratorial and judicial organs is pure. Under this basic condition, the continuous blows to counter-revolutionary elements and criminals in recent years have consolidated the people's democratic power, laid the foundation for the rule of law, swept away the darkness of the reactionary period, and established a bright image and widespread trust among the people. Chairman Mao's instruction "Do not wrong a good person" has become the code of conduct and goal of the staff. And expressions of trust can be heard from time to time in society or among prisoners. The achievements of the procuratorial organs, judicial organs, and public security organs in Shanghai and Zhejiang are definite and significant. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work, which remain to be improved.

Since the establishment of people's procuratorates at all levels and the promulgation of the arrest and detention regulations, many achievements have been made. For example, in 1955, the Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate approved 81.3% of the arrests in the review of arrests, disapproved 12.52%, and returned 6.18% to the public security organs for supplementary investigation; in the first quarter of 1956, 63% were decided to be prosecuted, 17.7% were decided not to be prosecuted, and 10.5% were under review; in 1955, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Procuratorate approved 64.1% of the arrests in the review of arrests, disapproved 21.7%, and returned 14.2% to the public security organs for supplementary investigation. These materials prove that due to the role of mutual restraint, the quality of arrests by the public security organs has been improved, and the phenomenon of wrongful arrests has been reduced day by day. In addition, the protests filed by the procuratorate against court judgments and the cases rejected by the court against the procuratorate's prosecution also prove that mutual restraint can guarantee the correctness of prosecution and judgment, and has gained good comments among the people.

The People's Procuratorate is a working organ of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee to supervise the implementation of the Constitution and the implementation of various policies, laws, and decrees, and resolutely fights against all counter-revolutionary elements and criminals with the development of the objective situation. However, due to the newly established procuratorate system, the organizations at all levels are not yet sound, the personnel are small (some counties in Zhejiang only have three people), and the professional level is low, so they cannot fully assume the responsibilities they should bear. Taking Shanghai and Zhejiang as examples: the work of reviewing and approving the arrest of criminals and prosecuting criminal offenders only began in the fourth quarter of 1955. Supervising trial activities, due to the small number of people, only a few cases have procurators appearing in court to support public prosecution. Zhejiang Province's statistics for 1955 show that the number of times procurators appeared in court throughout the year accounted for only 2.4% of the total number of prosecuted cases. The plan for 1956 is only 25-30%, and only 40-50% in 1957; the supervision of the trial of major civil cases has not yet begun; in terms of general supervision work, Zhejiang Province has used its powers to inspect and correct many cases that hinder agricultural production, mutual aid and cooperation, unified purchase and sales, increased production and conservation, conscription of new recruits, and industrial and commercial transformation, which violate policies and laws, and have played a good role. Shanghai has also done a lot of work in this regard. However, in general, not enough attention has been paid to this work, and it has not been widely developed. The general supervision work system has not yet been established; as the eyes and ears and assistants of the procuratorial work, the procuratorial correspondents have only developed 291 people in Shanghai and only 1,884 people in Zhejiang. Only key establishments have been established, but not universally. All the above points show that although the procuratorial work is a very important link, it is also the weakest link. Due to the small establishment and few personnel, it cannot fully exert its broad effect. The final account of the national procuratorial expenses in 1955 was 62.21% of the budget, which shows that the construction of the procuratorial organs has not yet completed its task. The national procuratorial budget for 1956 increased by 176.4% compared with 1955, which shows the country's emphasis on procuratorial work. I further believe that the procuratorial budget and establishment must be correspondingly balanced with the comparable parts of the budget and establishment of the judicial and public security organs in order to adapt to the development of the objective situation of the country's socialist construction. At present, the most important difficulty in procuratorial work is the lack of cadres. For this reason, I hope that the Congress and the Standing Committee will pay attention to it, and all parties will support it. This difficulty should and can be overcome.

In terms of trial work, the people's assessor system has been basically established in Shanghai and Hangzhou; some counties in Zhejiang have not yet established or are not yet sound, which is said to be because the regulations on the election of assessors are not clearly defined, and the county's election has difficulties.

In Shanghai and Hangzhou, I had discussions with some judicial and procuratorial personnel, and they unanimously reflected the superiority of the assessor system and the good role played by the assessors in the trial of cases and among the people.

In the symposium with some assessors, some assessors reflected that insufficient attention was paid to the opinions of the minority in the collegial panel. For example, in a certain case, the assessor believed that it was not appropriate to sentence three years of imprisonment. Because the opinion was in the minority, the result was still three years. After we consulted the case file and studied with the local court president, we all believed that the sentence of three years was inappropriate, and the dissenting opinion was not recorded in the file. It can be seen that the opinion of the minority is not necessarily unreasonable. Some assessors reflected that the people are very concerned about the court's judgment and require the assessors to report on the handling of the case, which is of great significance for the publicity and education of the people on law and discipline, but it has not been well summarized and promoted to become a system. Some other assessors also reflected that some judges do not respect and help them enough, and there are shortcomings in the court's working methods and the attitude of the judges. For example, in some cases, there were no procurators or defense lawyers present at the trial, and even no judges, and only the assessors and clerks opened the court; some people were wrongly identified at the mass sentencing conference, giving the masses a bad impression; some counter-revolutionary criminals did not have enough bailiffs to guard them, so they walked up and down by themselves during the trial, etc. All these opinions are helpful for improving the trial work. Generally speaking, the judicial and administrative departments and the courts do not often hold discussions with the people's assessors, listen to their opinions, and do not know enough about them. There are no detailed statistical analyses of their political, cultural, professional level, and work, thinking, and family life, and there are no specific plans to help them.

The Constitution stipulates that in trials, "the accused has the right to obtain defense," which is an important provision to protect the interests of the accused. The Shanghai Lawyers Association started to work externally in April. According to the statistics in April, it received 1,881 legal inquiries from citizens (including various criminal and civil cases) and drafted 469 complaints and contracts; the business developed even more in May, and the fees increased greatly, which shows the urgent need of the masses for legal counsel. It should be particularly noted here that the people's lawyer system is fundamentally different in nature from the old lawyer. The old lawyer served for money, only acted as an agent for litigation, and did not answer the legal questions of the masses. The people's lawyer served the people. Its main job was to answer legal questions for the masses, and acting as an agent for litigation was only a part of the work. It played the role of assistant and supervisor to the court and helped the court to handle cases correctly. (Soviet lawyers' work in receiving the masses accounted for 60% of their workload). Many cases could be eliminated after answering, which also played the role of legal publicity and education for the masses, which fully demonstrated its wide range of services to the people and its superiority.

At the lawyers' symposium, some reflected that the previous indictments only had a few empty hats and no actual content. They have paid more attention recently, but there are still many rough ones; some reflected that the previous indictments considered strictness more and leniency less. Now the procuratorate considers objectivity more; according to some indictments I have seen, it proves that what they said is true. In particular, citing legal provisions, only writing a certain article and not writing out the article is a big shortcoming that makes the defendant unable to clearly know his legal responsibility; some reflected that the implementation of lawyer defense has promoted the prosecution work of the procuratorate. For example, the Shanghai Maritime District Court had two cases prepared to be heard in two days. Because a lawyer appeared in court on the first day to defend, the hearing date on the second day was changed. The reason was that the inspector's preparation was not sufficient; some also reflected that some defendants had opinions on the facts listed in the indictment, but they did not understand how to defend themselves; some defendants could not understand the judge's questions and had to be helped by lawyers. For example, a defendant admitted all the crimes listed in the indictment that he had served as a Japanese translator, swept the countryside, and tortured farmers. However, after the lawyer talked to him, he found that he was only thirteen or fourteen years old when he was a translator. Because he cooked for the Japanese army, he learned Japanese and asked him to pass on words when the Japanese tortured the farmers. After the lawyer analyzed and defended the defendant's favorable materials, the case has been re-investigated and dealt with. Some also reflected (the court also reflected the same) that it is better for the court to appoint a lawyer to defend than for a family member or group to act as a defender. For example, a family member came to court to defend, but actually formed a witness and instead asked the court to deal with the defendant according to law. The reason for this may be that they do not understand the meaning of defense on the one hand, and on the other hand, they are afraid of being said to be defending criminals and losing their political position. In addition, we also attended some cases as observers. In one case, the district court sentenced three years of imprisonment. Because there were no procurators and defenders present, the higher court sent it back for retrial. After the lawyer defended, the original sentence of three years was changed to one year with probation. This measure of the higher court is very correct, and it also fully shows that the lawyer's defense not only protects the interests of the defendant, but also helps the court to correctly try the case. I think the lawyer system must be actively established in the future.

In addition, according to reports, in many agencies, schools, groups, and enterprises, whenever someone is arrested, they are immediately expelled. In some cases, the court ruled that the defendant was innocent, but the defendant also lost his schooling and job. It is very difficult to restore his student status and find a job again. I think this shortcoming should be corrected. The main reason for this situation is that on the one hand, they hate criminals very much and kick them out to avoid being blamed for protecting criminals; on the other hand, they do not understand Chairman Mao's instruction "Do not wrong a good person" enough, and cannot correctly combine protecting the defendant's legal interests with protecting the interests of the country. Therefore, there are few who provide information to help the case be resolved as soon as possible in the defendant's favor. These all show that the protection of the defendant's legal interests is not well understood by some cadres.

The trial workload of the courts in Shanghai and Zhejiang has been significantly improved, and the number of backlog cases has been greatly reduced. A model worker judge, Huang Jianping, appeared in a certain court. Promoting her advanced work experience has greatly improved the efficiency of handling cases. However, in order to handle backlog cases and rush tasks, the quality of handling cases is inevitably rough. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Justice admitted this in its report. Therefore, the Shanghai Higher People's Court is going to conduct a comprehensive inspection. This action is very necessary. I suggest that higher-level courts conduct a comprehensive inspection of subordinate courts nationwide. According to the president of the Zhejiang Provincial Higher People's Court, some backlog cases seem to be very serious in terms of the case, but there is no sufficient evidence, and it is difficult to obtain new evidence. Therefore, it is impossible to make a judgment, and it is delayed year after year. I suggest that the Supreme Court make a solution for similar cases.

In the symposium with the Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate, it was reported that a farmer in the countryside was arrested for occasional attempted theft because he was separated from his partner and had no money to go home. He was sentenced to five years of imprisonment by the court and sent to Xinjiang for labor reform. The defendant's family was never notified. The partner thought he had jumped into the Huangpu River and died. The family spent money to hold a funeral. Later, they received a letter from the prisoner and learned that he was not dead. After the family wrote to the procuratorate to inquire, the case was corrected according to the circumstances. I visited a defendant's family in Shanghai. It is said that his daughter was arrested for 9 months and did not know where she was being held.

According to the report of the Shanghai Huangpu District Procuratorate, 26.5% of the criminals detained by the public security organs have not applied for approval of arrest within 48 hours in accordance with the regulations on arrest and detention, and some have even exceeded the time limit by 14 days. The procuratorate failed to reply on time in 25.1% of the cases.

Not long ago, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress received a letter from a defendant's family, saying that "a defendant was arrested in 1951 and has not been tried or judged until now." I went to Shanghai to consult the case file, but the case file was not in the court or the procuratorate. Finally, it was obtained from the public security organ. After investigation, the defendant was interrogated several times by the public security organ in 1951. He was not interrogated in 1952 and 1953. He was interrogated several times again in 1954, and then he was not interrogated again. He was neither sent to the procuratorate for prosecution nor released. Are there similar cases? These show that the regulations on arrest and detention have not been thoroughly observed. I suggest that the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security conduct a thorough inspection.

In addition, according to the president of a certain court in Shanghai, some criminals can be not arrested even if the procuratorate prosecutes them. For example, if it is a historical crime and the defendant has a permanent address and a fixed occupation, and there is no danger if he is not arrested and he cannot run away, he can be not arrested and can be summoned by the public security organ and the court for trial. If he is found guilty, he can be arrested again, and it is not too late. This shows that the public security organ's application for arrest and the procuratorate's approval of arrest are not careful enough.

Some of the problems I saw during this inspection were caused by the staff's insufficient understanding, publicity, implementation, and compliance with policies, laws, and decrees; some were caused by the absence of criminal law. For example, in a certain case, the defendant was a bandit in 1939, but he has not committed any crimes or bad behaviors since 1942. He joined the New Fourth Army in 1942 and worked in a factory in Shanghai in 1948. He has been working for more than eight years. The case file does not show that he has committed any counter-revolutionary crimes, but he was arrested in the anti-counter-revolutionary movement for concealing his historical crimes and resisting confession. The indictment cited the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment as a counter-revolutionary case. Assessors in Hangzhou reflected that there were also cases of technical responsibility accidents that were sentenced by citing the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries. It is understood that there are quite a few similar cases. It may be because the procurators are not clear about the specifications and boundaries of the case, and at the same time, because there is no criminal law, they abuse the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries. These cases are all classified into the scope of counter-revolution, thus increasing the number of counter-revolutionary cases, which is not good for the country. It is also wrong to put the hat of counter-revolution on ordinary criminal offenders. I learned from procuratorial personnel, judicial personnel, assessors, defense lawyers, and some people that they all hope that the criminal law and civil law will be enacted and promulgated as soon as possible. They also believe that "even if it is not very perfect, it is much better than nothing," which is very worthy of our legislative organs and staff to pay close attention to. My inspection is only partial, and I hope that the representatives will correct whether my opinions are correct.

    希望早日制定刑法民法
    ——黄绍竑代表的发言
    我这次视察了上海、浙江两地部分的检察、审判工作。我就这方面发言。
    我首先看到1955年肃清反革命运动中获得的巨大胜利，再一次给反革命分子以沉重的打击。在社会主义美好前途的吸引下，在镇压与宽大相结合的政策的感召下，敌人的内部已发生了动摇和分化，尤其是“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”公布，各地贯彻执行该草案第四、五两条规定的政策，更增加他们弃暗投明、立功赎罪的决心。浙江省统计：今年三月份投案自首的有3，943名，四月份就增加到14，947名。上海市监狱的犯人学习了“全国农业发展纲要
  （草案）”后，也以第四、五两条对他们的鼓舞最大，认识到只要自己积极争取改造，服刑满后，仍有前途，因此，改造信心空前高涨，劳动积极性大为提高，纷纷提出了要加速改造自己的保证。所有这些都证明了“镇压与宽大相结合”、“抗拒从严、坦白从宽”的政策是非常正确的。
    但是，我觉得各地对政策和法纪的宣传工作还作得不够，例如：杭州市人民检察院和公安局公开宽大处理了向我投案自首的台湾特务分子张毅之后，当即就有10个尚在进行隐蔽破坏活动的反革命分子投案自首。全国各地这种例子是不少的，尚未有足够的、及时的宣传。同时，我还觉得“抗拒从严、坦白从宽”的政策应该在平时多作实际的宣传，才能收到积极广大的效果。如果在某些案子审讯或审判当中过分强调，就可能发生不好的副作用。我在视察中曾看到有些被告因为惧怕“抗拒从严”而不敢辩护或不敢上诉；有些为了要表示坦白而得从宽，把一些与案情无关的或假的也说了出来，作为坦白的表现；甚至个别审判员或检察员也错认辩护或上诉是“抗拒”，或者过分地、主观地追求“坦白”，而把案子拖延很久，甚或因之错诉错判。
    其次，我觉得我国的检察司法制度是优越的，检察司法机关干部的品质是纯洁的。在这个基本条件之下几年来给反革命分子、犯罪分子以不断的打击，巩固了人民民主政权，奠定了法治基础，把反动时期的黑暗扫除殆尽，在人民群众中树立了光明的印象和广泛的信赖。毛主席“不要冤枉一个好人”的指示，已成为工作人员的守则和目标。而在社会上或犯人中信赖的表示不时可以听到的。上海、浙江两地的检察机关、司法机关、公安机关的成绩是肯定的，是显著的。但是工作上的缺点仍然是不少的，尚有待于改进。
    自从各级人民检察院成立，逮捕拘留条例公布后，已有了不少的成绩。如上海市人民检察院1955年在审查逮捕人犯工作中，批准逮捕的占总数的81.3％，不批准逮捕的占12.52％，退回公安机关补充侦查的占6.18％；1956年第一季度决定起诉的占总数的63％，决定不起诉的占17.7％，正在审查的占10.5％；浙江省人民检察院1955年在审查逮捕人犯工作中，批准逮捕的占总数的64.1％，不批准逮捕的占21.7％，退回公安机关补充侦查的占14.2％。这些材料证明由于相互制约的作用，使公安机关的逮捕质量有所提高，错捕的现象日形减少。又检察院对于法院判决提出的抗议案件和法院对于检察院起诉驳回的案件，也证明相互制约是能够保证起诉和判决工作的正确性的，在人民群众中获得了良好的评论。
    人民检察院是全国人民代表大会和常务委员会监督宪法实施和贯彻各种政策法律法令的工作机关，随着客观形势的发展与一切反革命分子和犯罪分子作坚决的斗争。但是，由于检察院制度是新建的，各级组织还不健全，人员少（浙江某些县仅有三人），业务水平低，尚不能完全担负起应负的责任，以上海市、浙江省而论：审查批准逮捕人犯和刑事犯起诉工作，1955年第四季度才开始。监督审判活动，出庭支持公诉因人员少，只有少数案件有检察员出庭。浙江省1955年的统计，全年检察员出庭次数仅占起诉案件总数的2.4％，1956年的规划也仅占25——30％，1957年也只有40——50％；主要民事案件的审判监督，迄今尚未开始；一般监督工作方面，浙江省已经运用职权检查，纠正不少的障碍农业生产、互助合作、统购统销、增产节约、征集新兵、工商业改造等工作中违反政策法令的案件，起了良好的作用。上海市在这方面也做了不少工作。但是，总的说来对此工作还没有足够的注意，还没有普遍的展开，一般监督的工作制度也未曾建立；作为检察工作耳目、助手的检察通讯员，上海市仅发展了291人，浙江省仅发展了1，884人，只有重点建立，尚未普遍。以上各点都说明了检察工作虽然是非常重要的一环，但是也是最薄弱的一环，由于编制小人员少，而不能充分发挥它广泛的效用。1955年国家的检察经费决算为预算的62.21％，这说明了检察机构建设尚未完成任务。1956年国家检察经费的预算比1955年增加了176.4％，足见国家对检察工作的重视。我进一步认为检察的预算和编制必须与司法、公安机关的预算、编制可比的部分相应地平衡，才能适应国家社会主义建设客观形势的发展。目前检察工作最主要的困难是干部缺乏，为此，希望大会和常务委员会加以注意，各方面予以支持，这个困难是应该而且不难克服的。
    在审判工作方面，人民陪审制度，上海、杭州两市已基本上建立起来；浙江某些县尚未建立或还不健全，据说是因陪审员的选举办法规定得不明确，县的选举有困难。
    在上海、杭州曾与部分的司法、检察人员座谈，一致反映陪审制度的优越性以及陪审员对于审判案件和在人民群众中所起的良好作用。
    在同部分陪审员的座谈会上，有的陪审员反映在合议庭上对于少数的意见不够重视，例如某案陪审员认为不宜判三年徒刑，因为意见是少数，结果仍判三年，经我们调阅案卷，并与当地法院院长研究，都认为判三年是欠妥当的，卷内也不把不同意的意见记录下来。可见少数的意见不一定是没有理由的。有的陪审员反映人民群众对法院的判决很关心，要求陪审员作经办案情的报告，这对于群众的法纪宣传教育有重大的意义，但没有好好地加以总结和推广，使之成为一种制度。其余一些陪审员还反映某些审判员对于他们的尊重和帮助不够，以及法院工作方法和审判员态度上的缺点，例如：有些案子审判时没有检察员和辩护律师出庭，甚至没有审判员，仅陪审员与书记员就开庭的；有的在群众宣判大会上把人犯提错了给群众不好的印象；有的反革命犯因法警少来不及看管，开庭时由他自己走上走下等等。所有这些意见，对于审判工作的改进都是有帮助的。总起来说，司法行政部门和法院对于人民陪审员不经常座谈，听取他们的意见，对他们的了解不够，他们的政治、文化、业务水平以及工作、思想和家庭生活情况，均未有详细的统计分析，对于他们进行帮助也没有具体的规划。
    宪法规定在审判中：“被告人有权获得辩护”，这是保护被告利益的重要规定。上海市律师协会四月开始对外办公。据四月份的统计，接待市民法律询问的共1，881人
  （包括刑事、民事各种案件），代书诉状、合同等469件；五月份业务更加发展，收费大为增加，可见群众对法律顾问的迫切需要。在这里应当特别说明的，人民律师制度与旧律师在本质上是根本不同的。旧律师是为金钱服务，只代理诉讼，不解答群众法律问题，人民律师是为人民服务的，它主要的工作是为群众解答法律问题，代理诉讼仅是工作中的一部分，对法院起助手和监督的作用，帮助法院正确处理案件。（苏联律师的接待群众工作占他们工作量的60％），很多案件经过解答就可消灭，也就是对群众起了法律宣传教育的作用，这充分显示它对人民服务的广泛性和优越性。
    在律师座谈会上，有的反映，以往的起诉书只有几顶空洞的帽子，没有实际内容，近来已较为注意，但粗糙的仍旧不少；有的反映，以往的起诉书考虑从严的多，考虑从轻的少，现在检察院考虑客观得多了；据我看到的一些起诉书，证明他们所说是确实的，尤其引用法律条文，光是写某条某条而不把条文写出来，至使被告不能清楚地知道他对法律上的责任，也是很大的缺点；有的反映，实行律师辩护后对检察院的起诉工作起了促进作用，例如：上海市水上区法院有二件案子准备分二天开庭，因为第一天有律师出庭辩护，第二天的庭期改了，原因检查员的准备没有充分；也有的反映，有的被告对起诉书所列事实有意见，但自己不懂应该怎样辩护；有的被告对审判员的问话不能体会，必须律师帮助他们，例如有一个被告对起诉书说他曾任日本翻译、下乡扫荡、刑拷农民等罪行全部承认。但经律师与他谈话后，发现他当翻译时年仅十三、四岁，因代日军烧饭，学会日语，在日本人拷打农民时要他传话。律师从被告有利的材料分析辩护后，该案已重行侦查处理。也有的反映，有的被告对法院指定律师辩护，起初是有顾虑的，不敢从自己有利方面来提问题，可能是惧怕成为抗拒从严或者律师不是真正为被告有利而辩护，直到开庭时看到律师确为他辩护后，在最后发言中就敢于向审判员提出自己的意见了；还有的反映（法院方面也有同样反映），家属或团体担任辩护人，不如法院指定律师辩护好，例如有一家属到庭辩护，实际上形成了证人，反而要求法庭对被告依法处理。其所以如此，一方面可能对辩护意义不了解，另一方面是怕说为犯人辩护，有失政治立场。此外，我们还出庭旁听了一些案子，有一案子，区法院判三年徒刑，因为没有检察员和辩护人出庭，上级法院发回重审的，经律师辩护把原判三年改判一年缓刑。上级法院这个措施是很对的，同时也充分说明了律师的辩护不但保护了被告利益，同时也帮助了法院正确地审判案件，我认为律师制度今后须要积极地建立起来。
    另外，据反映不少的机关、学校、团体、企业里，凡遇有人被捕，马上将他除名，有些案子法院判决无罪，被告也就失学、失业了，要想恢复学籍，再找职业，就十分困难，我以为这种缺点要设法纠正。所以造成这种情况的主要原因一方面是对犯罪分子十分痛恨，一脚踢出去，以免受袒护罪犯的责难；另一方面是对毛主席“不要冤枉一个好人”的指示体会不够，不能把保护被告在法律上应有的利益和保护国家的利益正确地结合起来，因而很少有就被告有利方面提供资料帮助案子早日解决的。这些都说明保护被告在法律上应有的利益在某些干部中尚了解得不够。
    上海市、浙江省法院的审判工作量，是有显著的提高的，积案已大大减少，某法院出现先进工作者审判员黄剑平，推广她的先进工作经验大大提高了办案效率。但为了办积案、赶任务，办案的质量就不免粗糙。上海市司法局在汇报时就承认了这点。因此，上海市高级法院要进行全面检查，这一行动是十分必要的。我建议在全国范围内由上级法院对所属法院进行全面的检查。又据浙江省高级法院院长谈，某些积案就案情看来是很严重，但没有足够的罪证，也很难获得新的罪证，因此，无法判决，年复一年地拖延下来，我建议最高法院对类似这种案子定出一个解决办法。
    与上海市检察院的座谈中，据反映有一个乡下农民因与伙伴失散，无钱回家，偶窃未遂被捕，经法院判处五年徒刑送到新疆劳改，一直不通知被告家属，同伴以为是跳黄浦江死了，家属化钱办丧事，后来接到犯人来信方知未死，经家属写信检察院询问才根据案情予以纠正。我在上海访问过一个被告的家属，据说他的女儿被捕了9个月不知关押在什么地方。
    又据上海黄浦区检察院报告，公安机关拘押人犯有26.5％尚未按照逮捕拘留条例规定在48小时内提请批准逮捕，甚至有逾限14天的。检察院未能按时批复的占25.1％。
    不久以前，人大常委会接到一个被告家属来信，说“某被告于1951年被捕，一直到现在不审不判”。我到上海要调阅案卷，可是案卷不在法院，也不在检察院，最后在公安机关调出来。经查被告逮捕后，1951年由公安机关审讯了几次，1952、1953年一直没有审讯，1954年又审讯了数次，以后就未审讯过，既不送检察院起诉，也不释放。类似的案子，是否还有呢？这些说明了逮捕拘留条例的规定尚未能彻底遵守。我建议最高人民检察院和公安部进行彻底检查。
    另外，据上海市某法院院长反映，某些案犯，即使检察院起诉了，也可以不逮捕，例如：系历史罪行，被告有永久的住址和固定的职业，不捕不会发生危险，也跑不了的，就可以不捕，可由公安机关、法院传审，如判决有罪，再行逮捕，也不为晚。这说明公安机关的申请逮捕和检察院的批准逮捕掌握还不够细致。
    我在这次视察中所看到的这些问题，认为有些是由工作人员对于政策、法律、法令的认识，宣传、贯彻、遵守不够而造成的；有些是由于没有刑法而造成的。例如：某一案子，被告在1939年当过土匪，但1942年以后一直没有犯过事和不好的行为，1942年曾投效过新四军，1948年到上海工厂做工，已有八年多工龄，在案卷中看不出他有反革命罪行，但在肃反运动中以隐瞒历史罪行抗拒交代被捕，起诉书引用惩治反革命条例，就作为反革命案判三年徒刑。杭州市陪审员反映，有将技术上的责任事故的案件也引用惩治反革命条例判罪的，据了解类似这样的案子还不在少数，可能是由于检察员对案情规格界限掌握得不清楚，同时又由于没有刑法而滥引惩治反革命条例，这些案子都归入反革命的范围，因而把反革命案件的数量加多了，这对国家的影响是不好的，把反革命的帽子扣在一般刑事犯头上，也是不对的。我从检察人员、司法人员、陪审人员、辩护律师以及一些群众中了解到他们一致希望刑法、民法早日制定颁布，他们并且认为“即使不很完善总比没有好的多”，这是非常值得我们立法机关和工作人员深切注意的。我的视察仅是部分，我的意见是否正确，希望各代表指正。
