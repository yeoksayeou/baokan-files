The Agricultural Cooperation Movement in Zhaoyuan County
——Speech by Representative Bayanhu

I fully agree with and support all the work reports of this conference, and I suggest that the conference adopt them. I am also willing to conscientiously implement them after the conference resolutions are made.

The Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Model Charter to be adopted by this conference is a historical document of important political and economic significance. Running the cooperatives well according to this charter will play a major role in consolidating and improving the cooperatives and developing agricultural production. I would like to offer some opinions on the agricultural cooperation movement and agricultural production.

Zhaoyuan County in Heilongjiang Province has flat terrain and fertile land, suitable for large-scale mechanized farming. The 2.1 million mu of land that has already been developed and cultivated is all along the right bank of the Songhua River and Nen River, with ample water sources that can be used for irrigating the land. There are also large areas of grassland suitable for grazing livestock, and more than 1 million mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed and cultivated.

By the end of 1955, the entire county had completed the task of agricultural cooperation. The number of farming households participating in advanced cooperatives accounted for 99.8% of the total number of farming households. The development of the cooperation movement was also rapid and healthy. Before the completion of advanced cooperation, every village had tried out or established many elementary cooperatives. The vast majority of the elementary cooperatives had increased their income, demonstrating the superiority of the elementary cooperatives and giving the broad masses of farmers a good influence. Moreover, there was nearly four years of history of running elementary cooperatives, with more than 80% of farming households participating in them. Under these circumstances, farmers felt that the organizational form of the elementary cooperatives was no longer suitable for the development of production. Coupled with the success of the pilot advanced cooperatives and the influence and promotion of the cooperation movement throughout the province and the country, this strongly attracted the farmers' desire to establish advanced cooperatives. Shortly after the publication of Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperation and the National Agricultural Development Program, the farmers' demands for establishing advanced cooperatives were further promoted. Therefore, the entire county quickly saw a new high tide in the advanced cooperation movement. The momentum of the movement was huge, the progress was rapid, and it was orderly. The number of farming households participating in advanced cooperatives rose rapidly to more than 99%, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. At the beginning, the county leadership, due to a lack of comprehensive investigation and analysis, was always accustomed to using the experience of running elementary cooperatives to deal with the problem of running advanced cooperatives. It underestimated the foundation of the four years of elementary cooperatives tried out by each village, resulting in the positive factors and favorable conditions for farmers to run advanced cooperatives. Therefore, although the originally planned plan was repeatedly revised, the leadership always lagged behind the actual situation and was forced to transform by the movement before completing the task of advanced cooperation. With the development of advanced cooperation, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers was further stimulated, thus setting off an unprecedented new production upsurge in the tide of advanced cooperation. The realization of advanced cooperation made the relations of production adapt to the development of the productive forces, and also greatly improved the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers. The situation that farmers yearned for of "everyone working, eliminating exploitation, eradicating the roots of poverty, and planting the roots of wealth" arrived, and the enthusiasm of the farmers greatly increased. Young farmers linked their beautiful ideals with joining the cooperative. The elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned were moved to tears in the discussion of the "Five Guarantees," saying that they were able to enjoy such a happy old age under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, a prosperous atmosphere prevailed in the countryside, filled with even greater love for the motherland and enthusiasm for working hard for the prospect of a better life. Therefore, this year's production, whether it is preparing for spring plowing, developing agricultural and sideline production, or building water conservancy projects, is more prominent than in previous years. Specific, advanced, and feasible measures to increase production have been formulated. Production technology has been improved, and the "winter leisure" of previous years has been turned into winter work. Starting from the severe winter of last year, farmers have been digging canals and wells, building fish ponds, leveling land, and transporting manure in the ice and snow, developing sideline production, etc. More than 700 of the more than 2,000 wells dug in the county this year were constructed in the winter, breaking the old rules of "not digging wells in winter and not building houses in summer," opening up new avenues for future large-scale well digging and greater use of groundwater to increase grain production. The area of rice fields has increased from more than 300 mu last year to more than 30,000 mu, an increase of 100 times. The effectiveness of new-style animal-powered farm implements has been brought into play, with the county-wide average increasing threefold (from an average of 225 mu per set to 900 mu). Water conservancy projects have been built, and 70,000 mu of projects have been completed to eliminate waterlogging. 100,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed (another 100,000 mu of land reclaimed by immigrants is not included), the amount of manure has been increased, the quality of manure has been improved, and a large amount of granular fertilizer has been self-made. The number of women participating in labor and their attendance rate have also greatly exceeded those of previous years. In sideline production, in addition to the inherent sideline production such as livestock, poultry, animal husbandry, fisheries, forestry, and rural handicrafts, the county has also developed sideline production such as fish farming, duck raising, beekeeping, and fruit tree cultivation to increase the income of the cooperative and solve the problem of arranging production and life for the elderly, weak, and semi-able-bodied. The reform of production technology, as well as various technical measures and the quality of field operations, have been greatly improved compared with previous years. This year, it is expected that there will be more high-yield cooperatives and high-yield land (the yield per mu of dry land will reach 700 jin).

These all show that the collective operation of agricultural production cooperatives has unparalleled superiority in "making the best use of people's talents, land's capabilities, and resources." These vivid examples shown by the broad masses of farmers in the all-round upsurge of socialist construction are truly valuable and moving. The countryside is now fighting with all its might to increase production. Through labor competitions, cooperative members are vying to increase attendance and are thinking of various effective measures to lay the foundation for increasing production throughout the year.

The instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao that it is necessary to ensure that 90% of the cooperatives increase production and strive for 90% of the cooperative members to increase their personal income are also matters of urgent concern to the broad masses of farmers, especially in the first year of advanced cooperation, which has important political and economic significance. After a winter and spring of active efforts and the giving play to the superiorities of advanced cooperative production, as well as the suitable spring rain and thriving seedlings, and the continued implementation of various production increase measures, if this can be basically realized and no serious natural disasters are encountered, it is expected that the total grain output of the county this year will possibly increase from 130,000 tons last year to 190,000 tons (an increase of 46%), and sideline income will also increase accordingly. In addition, the conscientious implementation of the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily ensures that 90% of the cooperatives and cooperative members have the possibility of increasing income, which has already been reliably guaranteed. However, to smoothly achieve this plan, many arduous efforts must still be made. Although this year there are many high-yield crops, many dry fields have been converted into paddy fields, there are many mixed planting areas, and there is more fertilizer application and wasteland reclamation, the threats of natural disasters such as rain, drought, wind, frost, insects, and hail still exist. Production organization is also in the historical stage of just transitioning from elementary cooperation to advanced cooperation. These new relations of production, scale of production, and operation management are all new to the farmers. Whether in the minds of cooperative members or in the production leadership of cooperatives, there are still many problems that urgently need to be solved. Therefore, it is very important to constantly and unremittingly organize and improve the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members, and to strive for greater achievements in the second half of the year's production through the implementation of production measures and the improvement of operation and management.

In implementing the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, the phenomenon of blindly purchasing a large number of excessive and premature means of production and cultural and entertainment supplies, and the phenomena of seeking grandeur, emphasizing ostentation, and setting up stalls have been basically reversed. Financial management and financial systems are being established and improved, the feeding management and breeding protection of livestock are also being improved, the democratic management of cooperatives is also being improved, the phenomena of unplannedness, idling, and waste are also being reduced, and backbones are constantly growing. In all townships and cooperatives, women have been elected as township heads, deputy township heads, cooperative chairmen, and deputy cooperative chairmen. The management committees of the cooperatives also have a certain number of female cooperative members and minority cooperative members. Minority cooperative members (such as Mongolians) also voluntarily and habitually retain their own dairy cows and hunting horses. These are all in line with the spirit of the Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Model Charter. However, as pointed out in the Model Charter, some cooperatives, when dealing with the relationship between individual cooperative members and the collective, have not correctly combined the individual interests of cooperative members with the collective interests of the cooperative, and the tendency to unilaterally emphasize collective interests while ignoring individual interests still exists. For example, some cooperatives underestimate the price of livestock, affecting the breeding protection of livestock. Some cooperatives give male and female cooperative members the same amount of work for the same quality of labor, but give women fewer work points (such as men ten and women eight), hindering women's production enthusiasm. In manure accumulation, there is no evaluation of thickness or fineness, no distinction between good and bad, and it is not possible to stimulate the accumulation of good fertilizer, and there is a lack of reasonable remuneration for cooperative members' personal manure accumulation. In full attendance awards, the requirements for female cooperative members are too high, affecting their necessary labor in the family. Some cooperative members only care about earning more workdays, regardless of the quality of labor, or do not take good care of public property, do not manage farm implements well, and cause livestock to become weak and die due to poor feeding. Solving these problems is also an important issue for further consolidating and improving agricultural production cooperatives and developing production. In terms of agricultural production, as stipulated in the Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Model Charter, all cooperatives have formulated production plans, and production increase measures are generally practical, but some cooperatives have set production increase targets too high and are divorced from reality. Some cooperatives do not closely integrate various long-term and seasonal sideline production with agricultural production, and these are all weak links in production. In the future, it is necessary to better organize and lead advanced cooperatives, conscientiously study the Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Model Charter, properly solve various problems in cooperatives, and effectively consolidate and improve cooperatives, so as to achieve the goal of increasing production and increasing the income of cooperative members.

In particular, the various contents stipulated in Article 26 of the Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Model Charter are very important. The problem that is least solved in our county is the problem of "water." The average annual rainfall in our county is only 400-450 millimeters, and the amount required for crops is about 600 millimeters or more. If there is a drought year, the water shortage will be even greater, which is one of the main reasons that seriously affects crop growth and grain production. In the future, in terms of utilizing and transforming natural conditions, it is necessary to try to make reasonable use of the water in the sky (rain), the water on the ground (rivers), and the water underground (digging wells) to make up for the water shortage, so as to promote crop growth and grain production. This is a problem of universal significance. However, this work is a scientific and technical work, and there must be a corresponding leading organization to constantly lead this work and make overall and reasonable plans to avoid doing good things poorly, wasting manpower and money, and resulting in "doing more work with half the results." We encountered such problems in digging wells and repairing canals in our county this year. We just did it when our heads got hot. Due to the lack of technical guidance and reasonable planning, "the canals were dug in high places, and the wells were dug in low places." As a result, some wells became waste products. According to the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program, the way to increase grain production in the future is to increase the yield per unit area and to reclaim wasteland to expand the cultivated area. The most complicated problem is to increase the yield per unit area. Although mechanization and electrification have not yet been achieved, in this stage before mechanization after advanced cooperation, due to the change in the relations of production and the improvement of productive forces, the favorable conditions for increasing production have also increased. Therefore, the yield per unit area should be upgraded again. We deeply realize that the potential for increasing land production is very large. The high yields that have appeared in our county in recent years fully prove this point. However, according to the investigation, the reason why it is so difficult to increase the unit area yield of grain on a large area is that, in addition to the incompatibility of the past relations of production with the productive forces and the frequent invasion of natural disasters, the biggest problem is that farmers lack scientific and technical knowledge for managing agricultural production. Therefore, the quality management of field operations cannot be constantly improved. In the future, we should combine farmers' inherent experience, adapt to local conditions, vigorously promote and disseminate advanced production technologies, and cultivate rural technical forces in a planned way. Appropriate promotion and reward systems should also be established for agricultural technical personnel in cooperatives to encourage the improvement of agricultural scientific and technological levels. The broad masses of farmers are also very eager to improve their agricultural production technology management.

The state has taken measures to reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated area to turn a large amount of wasteland into fertile farmland. According to the tasks assigned to us, our county has settled more than 2,000 immigrant households this year and built 7 new villages. Such a large amount of immigration and wasteland reclamation is still new work for us. As far as I know, there are still 100 million mu of wasteland in Heilongjiang Province suitable for large-scale immigration and wasteland reclamation. We are actively preparing to meet this glorious task. However, judging from this year's immigration and wasteland reclamation, because we have no experience in the first year, many problems have also occurred, such as insufficient material preparation, too many people coming at once, and some differences between the living habits and climate in the interior and the Northeast. We are not considerate enough, and the education on overcoming difficulties and self-reliance is not enough in the mobilization work. Therefore, immigrants are not prepared enough for the long-term settlement and hard work, and their emotions fluctuate and are uneasy. After arduous and patient work, it has now been basically resolved, and the production order is returning to normal. However, such a large number of immigrants strengthening the organization of production and preparing for next year's production still requires great efforts. We should learn from this lesson in the future and work together to do this important work well.

    肇源县的农业合作化运动
    ——巴彦胡代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护这次大会的各项工作报告，建议大会予以通过。并愿在大会决议后，认真贯彻执行。
    这次大会将要通过的高级农业生产合作社示范章程，是具有重要政治、经济意义的历史文件，按照这个章程把合作社办好，它将对巩固提高合作社和发展农业生产起着重大的作用。我仅就农业合作化运动与农业生产问题发表一点意见。
    黑龙江省肇源县地势平坦，土地肥沃，适于大面积的机耕作业，现在已经开发耕种的210万亩土地，全部沿着松花江和嫩江的右岸，有着充足的水源可以利用灌溉土地，也有大片适宜于放牧的草原牧养着牲畜，还有100多万亩荒地可以开垦耕种。
    全县在1955年底，就完成了农业合作化的任务，参加高级社的农户已占总农户的99.8％，合作化运动的发展也是迅速的、健康的。在完成高级合作化前，村村都试办或办了不少初级社，绝大多数的初级社都增加了收入，显示了初级社的优越性，给广大农民以良好的影响，而且办初级社有近四年的历史，参加初级社的农户达到80％以上，在这种情况下，农民感到初级社的组织形式已经不适应于生产的发展，再加高级社试办的成功与全省全国各地合作化运动的影响推动，强烈的吸引着农民办高级社的愿望。在毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告公布不久，又公布了全国农业发展纲要，更加促进了农民办高级社的要求，所以全县很快又出现了高级合作化运动的高潮，运动的声势浩大，进展迅速，多而不乱，参加高级社的农户像雨后春笋一样迅速的上升到99％以上。开始在县的领导上因为缺乏全面的调查分析，总习惯于用办初级社的经验处理办高级社的问题，低估了村村试办四年初级社的基础酿成农民办高级社的积极因素和有利条件，因此虽然多次反复的修改原订的计划，但总是领导落后于实际，被运动迫使着转变，才完成了高级合作化的任务。随着高级合作化的发展，更加激发了广大农民的劳动热情，因而在高级合作化的浪潮中，掀起了空前未有的新的生产高潮。高级合作化的实现，使生产关系适应了生产力的发展，也使广大农民的社会主义觉悟又大大提高了一步，农民向往的“人人劳动，消灭剥削，拔掉穷根，扎下富根”的形势到来，农民的积极性大大增长。青年农民把自己的美好理想同入社连结在一起，老弱孤寡在讨论“五保”中，感动的流下热泪，说他们能够在共产党领导下享受这样幸福的晚年。因而农村中普遍地呈现着欣欣向荣的气象，到处洋溢着更加热爱祖国和为美好生活的前景而努力生产的热情。所以在今年的生产上，无论是备耕春耕，发展农副业生产，兴修水利等，都比往年突出。制定了具体的先进可行的增产措施。提高了生产技术，把历年“冬闲”变为冬忙。从去年的严寒冬季开始，农民就在冰天雪地里开渠打井，修筑渔塘，整地送粪，开展副业生产等，全县今年所打的2，000多个水井中，有700多个是冬季施工的，打破了“冬天不打井，夏天不盖房”的陈规，给今后大量开展打井，更多地利用地下水增加粮食产量上，打开了新的门路。水稻面积由去年的300余亩增加到3万余亩，增长100倍。发挥了新式畜力农具的效能，全县平均提高三倍（由每套平均发挥225亩，增加到900亩），兴修了水利工程，完成了排除内涝工程达7万余亩，开荒10万亩（另有移民垦荒10万亩不在内），增加了粪肥数量，提高了粪肥质量，并大量的自制了颗粒肥料。妇女参加劳动的人数与出勤率也大大的超过了往年。在副业生产上，除家畜、家禽、牧畜业、渔业、林业、农村手工业等固有副业生产外，还发展了养鱼、养鸭、养蜂、经营果树等副业生产，以增加社的收入，和解决了老弱半劳力生产、生活的安排问题。生产技术的改革，以及各项技术措施与田间作业质量都比往年大大提高，今年预计将出现更多的高产社与高额产量地（高产地每亩旱田产量将达700斤）。
    这些都表明了农业生产合作社的集体经营，对于“人尽其材，地尽其力，物尽其用”上，有着无比的优越性。广大农民在社会主义建设的全面高涨中所表现的这些生动事例，确实可贵和令人感动。现在农村正以全力为增加生产而奋斗中，社员通过劳动竞赛，纷纷争取多出勤，想出各种有效措施，为给全年增产打下基础。
    中央和毛主席所指示的，必须保证90％的合作社增产，争取90％的社员增加个人收入问题，这也正是广大农民所迫切关心的事情，尤其像高级合作化的头一年，更有其重要的政治、经济意义。我们全县农民，经过一冬一春的积极努力和高级社生产优越性的发挥，加之春雨适宜，青苗茁壮，各项增产措施继续在执行中，如能基本实现，不遇严重的自然灾害，预计今年全县的粮食总产量将有可能从去年的13万吨增加到19万吨，（增长46％），副业收入也将有相应的增加，加之认真贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针，保证90％的社与社员增加收入的可能，已经有了较为可靠的保证。但是顺利地实现这一计划，尚须作许多艰苦的努力。虽然今年高产作物多，旱田改水田多，混种面积多，施肥开荒多，但是雨、旱、风、霜、虫、雹等自然灾害的威胁仍然存在，生产组织也正处在刚刚由初级合作化转到高级合作化的历史阶段，这种新的生产关系、生产规模和经营管理等对农民都是头一年，不论在社员的思想上或合作社的生产领导上，还有许多问题急待解决。因此经常不懈的组织和提高广大社员的劳动积极性，通过贯彻执行生产措施，改进经营管理，在下半年的生产中争取更大的成绩，是十分重要的。
    在贯彻执行中共中央和国务院勤俭办社的指示上，基本上扭转了盲目购置大量过多过早的生产资料与文化娱乐用品，和图阔气、讲排场、摆摊子的现象，财务管理与财务制度正在建立和改进，牲畜的饲养管理与繁殖保护也在改善，合作社的民主管理也在提高，计划不周、窝工浪费的现象也在减少，骨干也在不断生长。所有的乡、社，都有妇女被选为乡长、副乡长、社长、副社长，社的管理委员会中也都有女社员和少数民族社员的一定名额，少数民族社员（如蒙族）也都按自愿和习惯留用着自己的乳牛、猎马，这些也都是符合高级农业生产合作社示范章程所规定的精神，但是正如示范章程中所指出的，有的合作社在处理社员个人同集体的关系时，没有把社员个人利益同合作社的集体利益正确的结合起来，片面的强调集体利益而忽视个人利益的倾向仍然存在，如牲畜作价时有的社偏低，影响对牲畜的繁殖保护，有的社，男女社员作了同质同量的劳动，而少给妇女记工分（如男十女八），妨碍了妇女的生产积极性。在积肥中，粗细不评，优劣不分，而不能刺激攒好肥，并缺乏对社员个人积肥的合理报酬，在满勤奖励中，对女社员的要求过高，影响她们在家庭的必要劳动。也有的社员只顾多挣劳动日，不顾劳动质量，或对公共财产爱护不够，农具管理得不好，牲畜饲养不良造成瘦弱和死亡等问题，仍不同程度的存在。解决好这些问题也是当前进一步巩固提高农业生产合作社和发展生产的重要问题。在农业生产方面，亦如高级农业生产合作社示范章程的规定，所有合作社均制定了生产计划，增产措施一般切合实际，但是有的社，增产指标订的过高，脱离实际。有的社对各种长年与季节性的副业生产紧密的与农业生产结合不够，这些都是生产上的薄弱环节。今后要更好的组织领导高级社，认真的学习高级农业生产合作社示范章程，妥善的解决合作社中的各种问题，切实的使合作社得到巩固与提高，从而达到增加生产、增加社员收入的目的。
    尤其高级农业生产合作社示范章程第二十六条中所规定的各项内容，是非常重要的。我们县解决最不够的是“水”的问题。我们县每年平均降雨量只400—450公厘，农作物的需要量大约为600公厘以上，如果遇到旱年，水缺得更多，这是严重影响农作物生长与粮食增产的主要原因之一。今后在利用和改造自然条件方面，要尽量合理的利用天上的水（雨）、地上的水（江、河）、地下的水（打井），来弥补缺水，从而促进作物生长与粮食增产上，是带有普遍意义的一个问题。但是这个工作是一项科学技术性的工作，必须有相应的领导机构，经常的去领导这个工作与通盘合理的规划，以避免好事办坏，劳民伤财，结果“事倍功半”。我们县在今年打井修渠上，就遇到这样问题，脑子一热就干，由于缺乏技术指导与合理规划，“渠道挖在高处，井打在洼处”，结果有的井成了废品。根据农业发展纲要的要求，今后粮食增产上的来路，一个是提高单位面积产量，一个是开荒扩大耕地面积，而最复杂的还是提高单位面积产量问题。现在虽然没达到机械化和电气化，但是在高级合作化以后，机械化以前的这个阶段里，由于生产关系的改变与生产力的提高，增产的有利条件也增多了，因而单位面积产量是应该再向上升格。我们深切的体会到土地增产的潜力是很大的，从我们县近几年来所出现的高额产量地来看，也充分的证明了这一点，但是大面积的提高粮食的单位面积产量上所以如此困难的原因，据考查，除过去生产关系与生产力的不相适应，与经常有自然灾害的侵袭外，最大问题是农民缺乏管理农业生产的科学技术知识，因此在田间作业质量管理上不能经常提高；今后应结合农民固有经验，因地制宜地，大力提倡与传播先进的生产技术，有计划的培养农村技术力量，在合作社的农民技术人员中亦应建立适当的升级与奖励制度，以鼓励农业科学技术水平的提高。广大农民现在对提高管理农业生产技术的要求也是非常殷切的。
    开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积，使大量的荒地变成肥沃的良田的工作，国家已采取了措施，我们县根据分配给我们的任务，今年安置了2，000余户移民，建设了7个新村。这样大量的移民垦荒工作，对我们还是新的工作，据我所知，黑龙江省尚有1亿亩荒地适于大量的移民垦荒，我们正在积极的准备迎接这一光荣任务。但是从今年的移民垦荒工作看，因为头一年没经验，也发生过不少问题，如在物资准备上不足，一下子来的太多，关内的生活习惯和气候与东北也有些不同，我们体贴的也不够，加之动员工作中说好的多，对克服困难自力更生的教育不够，因而移民对长期安家立业和艰苦奋斗的思想准备不足，情绪波动不安，经过艰巨耐心的工作，现已基本得到解决，生产秩序走向正常，但是这样大批移民加强组织生产，准备明年生产仍须要极大的努力，今后应记取这一教训，共同把这项重要工作作好。
