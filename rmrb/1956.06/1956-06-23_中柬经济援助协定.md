    Sino-Cambodian Economic Aid Agreement

    The agreement between our government and the Royal Government of Cambodia on economic assistance has been signed. According to this agreement, China will provide Cambodia with goods and commodities worth 8 million pounds sterling free of charge in 1956 and 1957 to help Cambodia develop its economy and improve the people's livelihood. At the same time, China is also prepared to send experts and technicians to provide technical assistance to Cambodia. The signing of this agreement marks a further development of the friendly relations between the Chinese and Cambodian people. This is a concrete result of the active implementation of the Bandung Conference resolutions by China and Cambodia, and another vivid example of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between Asian countries.

    The people of China and Cambodia have historically lived in friendship. The Chinese people regard Cambodia as a close neighbor and the Cambodian people as brothers. We had similar experiences under colonial oppression in the past and carried out the same struggles; we have always sympathized with and cared for each other. Now that both our countries have embarked on the road of independent development, and we both demand to build a free and happy life on our own land, our mutual understanding has deepened, and our desire to support each other has become more urgent. It is precisely because of this that the friendly contacts and economic and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Cambodian people are developing and expanding day by day. Now, China's economic assistance to Cambodia stems from this desire for friendly cooperation and mutual support, and it is completely sincere and selfless.

    China's economic assistance to Cambodia is not attached to any conditions. All materials and commodities given by China to Cambodia are freely used by the Cambodian government, and China does not interfere in any way. This fully demonstrates China's respect for Cambodia's national sovereignty and national independence, and the spirit of equality in mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries. It fully embodies the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people have always supported Cambodia in pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality. Cambodia's acceptance of China's unconditional economic assistance will obviously be conducive to Cambodia's consolidation of its independence and adherence to its policy of peace and neutrality, and will promote friendship and understanding between the Chinese and Cambodian people, thereby contributing to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    Asian countries that are striving for and consolidating national independence are clearly aware that in order to permanently get rid of colonial oppression and poverty and backwardness, it is necessary to develop the national economy and implement industrialization. In order to achieve this goal, they must first use their own resources and strength to rely on their own efforts and seek independent economic development. At the same time, it is also necessary to obtain assistance from other countries. However, this kind of assistance must not harm the sovereignty and national independence of the recipient country, and must not become an excuse and tool for interfering in the internal affairs of the recipient country. Because accepting this kind of "assistance" can never enable the recipient country to get rid of poverty and backwardness and develop its own national economy.

    Imperialist countries have never been willing to support the aspirations of Asian countries to develop their economies and achieve industrialization. On the contrary, in order to keep these countries forever as appendages of monopoly capital and objects for extracting maximum profits, they desperately try to prevent the economic development and industrialization of backward countries. Therefore, the "assistance" of imperialist countries to backward countries, from its content, conditions, and especially from the results of accepting this "assistance", always infringes upon the sovereignty and interests of the recipient country and damages the independent development of the national economy. Moreover, some people often want to use this "assistance" to manipulate those young countries that encounter difficulties on the road to independent development. For example, not long ago, the United States attempted to use the method of stopping or reducing "US aid" to pressure Cambodia to abandon its neutral policy, which is in line with its national interests. This practice of the United States is commonplace, and it cannot but arouse the indignation and opposition of every Asian with backbone.

    The economic assistance agreement signed between China and Cambodia is a new development in mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Asian countries. We believe that the spirit embodied in this agreement is in line with the common views and common aspirations of the people of Asian countries. It also makes people see more clearly how broad and promising the prospects for friendly cooperation between Asian countries are.

### 中柬经济援助协定

    中柬经济援助协定
    我国政府和柬埔寨王国政府关于经济援助的协定，已经签字了。根据这个协定，我国将在1956年和1957年内无偿地给予柬埔寨价值八百万英镑的物资和商品，以便帮助柬埔寨发展经济，改善人民生活。同时，我国还准备派遣专家和技术人员，对柬埔寨进行技术援助。这个协定的签订，标志着中柬两国人民友好关系的进一步发展。这是中柬两国积极执行万隆会议决议的具体结果，也是亚洲国家之间和平共处、友好合作的又一个生动的例子。
    中柬两国人民在历史上就是友好相处的。中国人民把柬埔寨视为亲近的邻邦，把柬埔寨人民视为兄弟。我们过去在殖民主义压迫下有过类似的遭遇，进行过同样的斗争；我们一直是互相同情和关怀的。现在，我们两国都已走上独立发展的道路，我们都要求在自己的国土上建设自由幸福的生活，因此，我们之间的互相了解就更加深了，我们要求互相支持的愿望就更加迫切了。正是因为这样，中柬两国人民的友好接触和经济文化交流正在日益发展和扩大。现在中国对柬埔寨进行经济援助，也就是出于这种友好合作和互相支持的愿望，它是完全真诚无私的。
    中国对柬埔寨的经济援助是不附带任何条件的。中国给予柬埔寨的一切物资和商品，都由柬埔寨政府自由使用，中国不加任何干涉。这充分说明了中国对柬埔寨的国家主权和民族独立的尊重，和两国在互助合作中平等对待的精神。它完全体现了和平共处的五项原则。中国人民一贯支持柬埔寨执行和平中立政策。柬埔寨接受中国的没有任何条件的经济援助，显然将有利于柬埔寨巩固自己的独立和坚持执行和平中立政策，促进中柬两国人民之间的友好和了解，从而有助于亚洲和世界的和平事业。
    正在争取和巩固民族独立的亚洲国家都清楚地认识到，为了永远摆脱殖民主义的压迫和贫困落后状态，必须发展民族经济和实行工业化。为了达到这个目的，它们首先要利用自己的资源和力量，自力更生，谋求自己经济的独立发展。同时，从其他任何国家取得援助，这也是必要的。但是，这种援助决不可以损害受援国家的主权和民族独立，决不可以成为干涉受援国家内政的借口和工具。因为接受了这种“援助”，决不可能使受援国家达到摆脱贫困落后和发展自己民族经济的目的。
    帝国主义国家对于亚洲国家发展经济和实现工业化的愿望，从来是不愿意支持的。恰恰相反，它们为了把这些国家永远作为垄断资本的附属品，作为榨取最大限度利润的对象，拚命阻挠落后国家的经济发展和工业化。因此，帝国主义国家对落后国家的“援助”，从它的内容、条件，特别从接受这种“援助”的结果来看，总是侵犯受援国家的主权和利益，损害民族经济的独立发展。而且，有人还往往想利用这种“援助”来摆布那些在独立发展的道路上遇到困难的年轻国家。例如，不久以前，美国就企图用停止或减少“美援”的办法，来压迫柬埔寨放弃它的符合民族利益的中立政策。美国这种做法是屡见不鲜的，它不能不激起每一个有骨气的亚洲人的愤慨和反对。
    中国和柬埔寨所签订的经济援助协定，是中国和亚洲国家之间进行互助合作的一个新的发展。我们相信这个协定所体现的精神是符合亚洲各国人民的共同观点和共同愿望的。它也使人们更清楚地看到了，亚洲国家之间友好合作的前途是多么辽阔而远大。
