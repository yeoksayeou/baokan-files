    Shanghai Captures a Large Shark
    (Our Shanghai Dispatch) The Shanghai Aquatic Products Company has caught a large shark weighing over 8,000 jin (approximately 4,000 kg) and about forty chi (approximately 13.3 meters) long.
    On the morning of May 19th, this shark entered the fishing nets of fishermen in the southern Yellow Sea. Due to the limitations of the sailing boat's equipment, the fishermen were unable to haul it onto the boat, so they notified the fishing vessel No. 216, which was fishing nearby. The crew on the fishing vessel surrounded it with steel cables and then used a crane to hoist it onto the deck. The fish lay across the deck and was much larger than a lifeboat.
    This large shark was transported to the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company's refrigerated workshop on the 6th. Its liver weighs more than 1,100 jin (approximately 550 kg) and can be used to make more than 700 jin (approximately 350 kg) of cod liver oil. The fins can be used to make shark fin, and the meat and skin can be processed into a large amount of fish meal and fish oil.

    上海捕了一条大鲨鱼
    本报上海讯　上海水产公司捕到了一条八千多斤重、约有四十多尺长的大鲨鱼。
    这条鲨鱼五月十九日上午在黄海南部洋面上窜进了渔民的网里，由于帆船设备的限制，渔民们无法把它捞上船来，便通知了在附近捕鱼的216号渔轮。渔轮上的船员们用钢丝绳索把它团团围缠住以后，使用起重机把它吊上甲板。鱼横在甲板上，比一条救生船要大得多。
    这条大鲨鱼已经在六日运送到上海水产公司冷藏车间。它的肝重一千一百多斤，能制七百多斤鱼肝油，鱼鳍可以做鱼翅，鱼肉、鱼皮等可以制成很多的鱼粉和鱼油。
