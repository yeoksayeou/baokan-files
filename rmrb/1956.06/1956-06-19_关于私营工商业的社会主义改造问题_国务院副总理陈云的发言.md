    On the Socialist Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce
    --Speech by Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yun
    On the Problems of Livelihood Difficulties and Business Arrangements for Some Small Shops, Vendors, and Peddlers -- On Properly Resolving Problems Existing for Small Business Owners -- On the Fixed Interest Rate Issue and Public-Private Relationship Issues in Joint Public-Private Enterprises -- On the Wage and Welfare Issues for Employees and Private-Side Personnel in Joint Public-Private Enterprises -- On the Problems of Enterprise Restructuring

    I will now express some opinions on the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

    In January of this year, the socialist transformation movement of private industry and commerce and handicrafts reached a high tide across the country. As of now, with the exception of a few border areas, all capitalist industry and commerce have implemented joint public-private ownership. Handicrafts have generally achieved various degrees of collectivization. Private transportation either implemented joint public-private ownership or achieved collectivization. The transformation of small shops and vendors has taken the following different forms: approximately 15% of small shops have participated in fixed-interest joint public-private ownership; approximately 25% have united several or dozens of households to form jointly operated cooperative stores bearing joint responsibility for profits and losses; approximately 60% are currently or are in the process of acting as purchasing and sales agents for state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, or, in addition to acting as sales agents, are independently operating some goods not handled by state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives.

    The transition of industry and commerce, handicrafts, and transportation from private, capitalist, and individual production and management systems to joint public-private ownership, to socialist cooperatives, is a fundamental change. Over the past six years, the People's Government and the people of the whole country have made significant efforts to prepare sufficient conditions for this change. The change of enterprises from private ownership to socialist ownership has long appeared in the world, but it is the first time in history that such a peaceful method has been adopted to make the national industrial and commercial circles so jubilant in accepting this change. It should be said that our country's socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, handicrafts, and private transportation has achieved a great victory. This is a victory for socialism, a victory for our country and the people of the whole country to move towards prosperity, strength, and a happy life. The people of the whole country should celebrate this victory as warmly as they celebrated the national agricultural collectivization.

    But can it be said that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, handicrafts, and transportation has been completed? Are there no more problems in the transformation? Can it be said that there are no mistakes and shortcomings in the transformation? No. The one-time approval of joint public-private ownership and collectivization is not the completion of the transformation, but rather the beginning of the transformation. There are still many problems in this transformation that require us to solve them one by one. In order to enable us to calmly solve these problems in stages and batches, on February 8 this year, the State Council made a decision that all private enterprises and handicrafts should continue to operate as before for six months without any changes after the approval of joint public-private ownership and collectivization. It should be admitted that such a broad, rapid, and inexperienced change is impossible without errors and shortcomings in the work, and there are quite a few errors and shortcomings. The State Council's decision makes it possible for us to minimize and quickly correct these errors and shortcomings.

    Now I will talk about the following five issues: First, the problem of livelihood difficulties and business arrangements for some small shops, vendors, and peddlers; second, the problem of appropriately resolving the existing problems of small business owners; third, the issue of fixed interest rates and public-private relationships in joint public-private enterprises; fourth, the issue of wages and welfare for employees and private-side personnel in joint public-private enterprises; fifth, the issue of enterprise restructuring.

    First, the problem of livelihood difficulties and business arrangements for some small shops, vendors, and peddlers.

    Small vendors are independent laborers in commerce, numbering about 2.4 million households nationwide, which, calculated at four people per household, is nearly 10 million people. As mentioned earlier, some of them have joined joint public-private stores and cooperative stores; some act as purchasing and sales agents or partial self-sellers for state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives. The former's turnover has greatly increased compared to when they were operating independently, and their business has no difficulties. The latter group is now experiencing difficulties, accounting for about 25% of all small vendors, and in a few places, they account for 50%. These small vendors' difficulties come from two aspects: on the one hand, because the expansion of the turnover of joint public-private stores and cooperative stores not only includes the portion of the social retail sales that increased this year compared to the previous year and the portion given up by state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives; but also includes the portion squeezed out from the turnover of those small vendors acting as purchasing and sales agents. On the other hand, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives did not take good care of the business of small vendors during this high tide of socialist transformation, lacked comprehensive arrangements; and also did not pay enough attention when the turnover of small vendors began to decline, and did not solve it in time.

    Among the small vendors who have not joined joint public-private stores and cooperative stores, many have put forward four demands: first, to require the supply of goods; second, to require loans; third, to require simplified tax systems; and fourth, to require entering socialism. We believe that these demands are reasonable and should be gradually resolved.

    Now the government is preparing to take a method to solve their livelihood difficulties and business arrangement problems. This method is to gradually, in stages, and by industry, organize them into cooperative groups with decentralized operations and joint responsibility for profits and losses, under the principle of voluntariness. At the same time, the commercial departments in various places should designate one store among the existing state-owned stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, and joint public-private stores as the wholesale store for the cooperative group. The tasks of this wholesale store are: first, to supply goods and find sources of goods for the cooperative group; second, to borrow money from the bank for the cooperative group to solve financial difficulties; third, to collect the taxes payable by each member of the cooperative group and pay them to the tax bureau on their behalf. In the future, the tax bureau should implement a strict, one-year, fixed-amount tax collection method for this tax. The expenses of this wholesale store are all paid by state-owned commerce or supply and marketing cooperatives, and are not borne by small vendors. The Ministry of Commerce and the supply and marketing cooperatives should take responsibility, and according to the different income situations of small vendors in various places, distinguish between the different situations of small vendors relying on commerce as their main income or using commerce as a supplementary income, and take various measures to enable all types of small vendors in various places to obtain the necessary income. At the same time, it is necessary to arrange small vendors as an important part of arranging all commercial work.

    Some people ask: Why doesn't the government organize all small vendors into joint public-private stores or cooperative stores? As everyone knows, most of the small shops, vendors, and peddlers are scattered in residential areas. These small vendors scattered in residential areas are a form of business service that our country will need for a long time to come in commerce. If they are all contracted and merged to form centralized joint public-private stores and cooperative stores, it will not be convenient for residents' consumption. If they are still allowed to operate in a decentralized manner and the state provides them with fixed wages, they will not be able to maintain their enthusiasm for operation. At the same time, there are some small vendors whose current income is higher than the income of employees in joint public-private stores and cooperative stores, and when they are unwilling to participate, they cannot be forced to merge into joint public-private stores and cooperative stores. Therefore, the correct principle for arranging these small vendors is to take care of the convenience of residents' consumption and to maintain the enthusiasm of small vendors for operation, so that they can obtain appropriate income. We believe that the method the government is now preparing to take is the best way to realize this principle at present, and it is also a reasonable way to realize the socialist demands of small vendors for a considerable period in the future. Taking this method can enable the vast number of scattered small vendors to closely connect with the socialist economy through the form of wholesale stores leading cooperative groups, and enable small vendors to receive commissions with the nature of piece-rate wages for purchasing and selling agents from state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives. In this way, these small vendors can be gradually become a component of socialist commerce.

    Second, on properly resolving the existing problems of small business owners.

    Our country's factories, shops, and transportation enterprises have both large and small. It is very obvious that large capitalist enterprises occupy a particularly important position in production and business; however, the number of small enterprises that hire a small number of employees is far more than large enterprises. At present, not only large enterprises have implemented joint public-private ownership, but also small enterprises have implemented joint public-private ownership. This means that a large number of small business owners have participated in joint public-private ownership. The status of small business owners was extremely unstable before liberation. In the capitalist competition of the big fish eating the small fish, small enterprises were constantly threatened with bankruptcy. Therefore, small business owners were at risk of unemployment at any time. At that time, a considerable part of the small business owners not only did not have a reliable profit income, but also often did not receive normal wages. After liberation, our country's small enterprises' business was arranged by the government, and the threat of the big fish eating the small fish no longer existed. After joint public-private ownership, they can get fixed interest income, and as long as they work hard, they no longer have the threat of unemployment. Precisely because of this, small business owners across the country warmly welcome joint public-private ownership. However, the fixed interest income of small business owners is not high, and the wages are not very high, so the government business departments should properly solve those problems that are closely related to the lives of small business owners.

    The first is the housing problem, which is the main part of the means of livelihood for small business owners. The State Council's regulations on the property inventory and valuation of joint public-private enterprises on February 8, 1956, pointed out that the issue of the disposal of houses in small enterprises where the home and shop are not separated or the home and factory are not separated should be handled according to the owner's opinion. Now it should be specifically stipulated that for enterprises where the home and shop, or home and factory are connected, in addition to the original storefront, factory building, and warehouse being used as joint venture assets, other houses should be owned by the owner as means of livelihood. Any errors or shortcomings in the handling of housing must be corrected.

    Secondly, many of the family members of small business owners who originally participated in the auxiliary labor of the enterprise should continue to be absorbed into auxiliary labor or make other appropriate arrangements after joint public-private ownership.

    Third, on the issue of fixed interest rates and public-private relations in joint public-private enterprises.

    Regarding the fixed interest rate issue, the State Council's regulations on implementing the fixed interest rate method for joint public-private enterprises on February 8, 1956, stipulated that the interest rate should be from one to six percent, that is, an annual interest rate of one to six percent, and pointed out that different interest rates can be adopted in different regions, different industries, and even different enterprises in the same industry. Over the past five months, many parties have suggested that the interest rate should be simpler and more relaxed when stipulating the interest rate. We believe that this opinion is correct and feasible. In terms of interest rates, we believe that a uniform annual interest rate of five percent can be stipulated regardless of industry and commerce, size, profit or loss, region, or industry. Enterprises that individually need to increase the interest rate can still exceed five percent. Enterprises that have already been under joint public-private ownership but have adopted the method of distributing profits proportionally should set the interest rate at five percent, the same as newly joint ventures. Enterprises that have already been under joint public-private ownership and have already adopted the fixed interest rate method should continue to pay if their interest rate exceeds five percent and will not be lowered; if their interest rate is less than five percent, it should be raised to five percent. Joint public-private enterprises and government business departments in various places should actively prepare and strive to pay interest once in July and August of this year.

    Regarding the issue of public-private relations. After the implementation of joint public-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce across the country, the issue of whether the representatives of the public and private sectors work well or not in a large number of joint public-private enterprises is a major issue related to the production and operation of the enterprise, and it is also an important issue related to whether the role of private personnel in production can be brought into play and whether private personnel can be effectively transformed into laborers.

    The solution to this important issue should currently start from the following aspects:

    First, it should be seen that China's national capitalists and private industrialists and businessmen have experience in enterprise production technology and business management, and they are useful for the management of our country's industry and commerce. We should analyze their production technology and business management knowledge. Any unreasonable parts should be gradually changed; any reasonable parts should not only continue to play its role in joint public-private enterprises, but also should be fully utilized in state-owned enterprises. We should regard all useful things in the production technology and business management knowledge of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts as national heritage and retain them. It is our responsibility to absorb these useful national heritages, and it is wrong to take a rude attitude of negating everything about these national heritages.

    Secondly, a large number of capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises only transitioned to joint public-private ownership in January of this year, and a large number of private personnel and public representatives still lack experience in working together within the enterprise. In order for both parties to work well together, party and government organs in various places should lead the business departments to regularly summarize experience in this area, and gradually formulate systems and methods for public and private cooperation based on these summaries of experience. The business guidelines, policies, and methods stipulated by the higher-level business departments should enable the relevant management personnel of both public and private sectors in the enterprise to be familiar with them. Various places should convene meetings of public representatives and private representatives separately to collect opinions, conduct education, and solve the difficulties they encounter in handling public-private relations. Sometimes, meetings should also be held with public and private representatives together to educate them. The responsible persons of the industrial and commercial business departments of the central and provincial/municipal governments should regularly hold symposiums with personnel from the local Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations, and the Democratic National Construction Association to exchange relevant issues in various aspects of public-private relations.

    Furthermore, the improvement of public-private relations in joint public-private enterprises must also educate the masses of employees, explaining that uniting private personnel, giving play to their strengths, and transforming private personnel into laborers is beneficial to the working class and the people of the whole country. At the same time, private personnel must also take a positive attitude to cooperate with public representatives and strengthen unity with the masses of employees. If the masses of employees have dissatisfaction with the past behavior of private personnel, private personnel should take the initiative to conduct self-criticism appropriately on appropriate occasions, and public representatives should also assist private personnel in explaining to the employees, so that all employees and public and private management personnel can unite to carry out production and operation. It should be seen that this unity requires a certain process. This is an education process for the masses of employees, public representatives, and private personnel, and it is also a process of transforming private personnel into laborers. We believe that through the efforts of all parties, the unity in joint public-private enterprises can definitely be achieved.

    Fourth, on the issue of wages and welfare for employees and private personnel in joint public-private enterprises.

    Many employees in joint public-private enterprises wrote letters to relevant agencies, saying that the differences in wage treatment in their enterprises are too large; that their wages are lower than the wages of state-owned enterprises, and requested the government to adjust them. According to the current preliminary materials, the wage standards of some employees in joint public-private enterprises are higher than the wage standards of similar state-owned enterprises, and some joint ventures, especially small factories and shops, are lower than the wage standards of similar state-owned enterprises. As everyone knows, the original wage standards among private enterprises are extremely inconsistent, and various treatments are also very different. It is impossible to immediately unify the extremely inconsistent wage treatments left over from the past in joint public-private enterprises, or to immediately unify the wage treatments of joint public-private enterprises with the wage standards of state-owned enterprises. It has been nearly seven years since the national liberation, and the wage standards of state-owned enterprises have not yet been completely unified. We should see that the gradual adjustment of wage standards in joint public-private enterprises will require several years. As for the problem of excessively large differences in wage treatment for employees in the same job in the same enterprise caused by enterprise mergers, this should be adjusted within the possible range. The policy of adjustment should be that the wages of employees in joint public-private enterprises, compared with the wages of employees in similar local state-owned enterprises, should not be lowered if they are higher, and should be increased in stages and gradually according to the production situation and the possibilities of the enterprise if they are lower. The relevant departments of the central government and local governments should propose a plan in the second half of this year, and implement it after approval.

    The production safety equipment and sanitation equipment of many private enterprises were originally very poor, and should be gradually improved after joint ventures.

    The wage income of members of handicraft production cooperatives and transportation cooperatives should not be lower than their labor income before joining the cooperative, but should be increased compared to their labor income before collectivization on the basis of working hard to improve business. If some handicraft production cooperatives and transportation cooperatives have reduced the income of their members compared to their labor income before joining the cooperative because they have extracted too much public accumulation fund, then the public accumulation fund should be reduced to increase the wages of the members. If cooperative stores also have excessively low wages for their staff because they have extracted too much public accumulation fund, the public accumulation fund should also be reduced and the wages increased to an appropriate level.

    The wages of private personnel in joint public-private enterprises will also be adjusted according to the principle of dealing with the wages of employees.

    Medical treatment for illnesses of private personnel in joint public-private enterprises should be assisted. For private personnel whose enterprises have assessed assets of less than 2,000 yuan, the medical treatment for their illnesses and the method of paying wages during sick leave should be handled in the same way as the treatment for employees in the enterprise. At the same time, for private personnel whose enterprises have assessed assets exceeding 2,000 yuan but have difficulties, the medical treatment for their illnesses and the method of paying wages during sick leave can also be handled with reference to the treatment for employees in the enterprise.

    Many people in industrial and commercial circles have proposed that relevant parties cooperate to raise a batch of funds to provide relief when industrialists and businessmen encounter difficulties. We approve of this proposal. It is hoped that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will draft methods and propose a plan, and the government can assist.

    Fifth, on the issue of enterprise restructuring.

    The government's plan for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce was originally prepared to be carried out in stages and in batches by industry and trade in various parts of the country over a period of two years. After the high tide of socialist transformation of industry and commerce arrived in January of this year, the government changed the original plan and approved the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, handicrafts, and transportation in various parts of the country at one time. In order to meet the requirements at that time, this change was necessary. However, this rapid change made it impossible for many business departments and many regions to accumulate experience in joint public-private ownership of the entire industry. Therefore, during those days of gongs and drums, many factories, handicraft workshops, shops, and transportation industries merged one after another in many places. Some that should not have been merged were merged, and some that could have been merged were merged too large. In short, too many were merged, and the units for unified calculation of profits and losses were too large. The State Council's decision on February 8 stopped this trend of blind mergers.

    Another problem that appeared in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and handicrafts was the artificial severance of the original supply and marketing relations and cooperative relations of industry and commerce. The socialist transformation work of industry, handicrafts, commerce, and transportation cannot be managed by one department, but can only be managed by various business departments with division of labor. This division of labor is necessary and reasonable. The problem is that there is a lack of close cooperation in work between the departments with division of labor. At the same time, it is not appropriate to divide which department some enterprises should belong to. Therefore, the original supply and marketing relations and cooperative relations of industry and commerce have been severed. For example, in the same industrial sector, the production of large and small enterprises was arranged together in the past, and they had close business connections; but now, because enterprises with four or more people are transformed by the industrial department, and enterprises with three or fewer people are transformed by the handicraft department, and the industrial and handicraft management departments often have inconsistent steps in arranging their production and business, the original relationship between them has been divided. For another example, clothing and shoe stores in the original commerce had fixed processing handicraft workshops. In the socialist transformation, clothing and shoe stores were transformed by the commercial department, and handicraft workshops that made clothing and shoes were transformed by the handicraft department, and many handicraft workshops that made clothing and shoes were merged in this handicraft collectivization movement. This has interrupted the original processing relationship between stores and handicraft workshops. There are many more unreasonable severance phenomena like this, and the contradictions between handicrafts and various aspects are the most numerous. In order to correct this artificial severance, the relevant government departments are taking measures to adjust.

    We believe that enterprise restructuring cannot be impatient and must be fully prepared. The State Council's decision to remain unchanged for half a year stopped some of the chaos at that time, giving business departments time to study and explore experience and methods in enterprise restructuring. However, this does not mean that each trade and industry can be restructured after the half-year period. No, all industrial, handicraft, commercial, and transportation enterprise restructurings should not be restricted by time, must be fully prepared, must be gradually transformed in batches and in stages by each trade and industry, and must be combined with production arrangements and carried out under conditions that are conducive to production. At present, the task of various places and business departments is to prepare restructuring plans for various industries for enterprises that have not been restructured, and to gradually adjust enterprises that have been merged incorrectly in a prepared manner.

    Regarding the reorganization of joint public-private enterprises and the arrangements for private personnel, attention should be paid to the fact that employees and private personnel are much more familiar with the situation of the original private enterprises and private personnel than the public representatives. The plans for enterprise reorganization and personnel arrangements proposed by them are generally appropriate. Therefore, the corresponding Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations, and private personnel can first make suggestions on the business reorganization and private personnel arrangements in all joint public-private enterprises. For enterprises that have been reorganized, if the opinions of private personnel have not been solicited in the past, and the private personnel believe that there are inappropriate aspects in the business reorganization and personnel arrangements, the opinions of the private personnel should be solicited again. As long as the disposal is improper, it should be changed. Similarly, the opinions of employees and technicians must also be solicited on business reorganization and personnel arrangements. We should absorb the opinions of all parties in order to do a good job in enterprise reorganization and personnel arrangements.

    As everyone knows, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, handicrafts, and private transportation is a complex and huge task. Our work in the past five months has achieved great results, but there are still many problems to be solved and many tasks to be done better in the future. Our socialist transformation work must achieve this goal: joint public-private enterprises must be better run than capitalist enterprises, and cooperative enterprises must be better run than individually operated enterprises. For all kinds of individual economies, we should help them gradually organize themselves in the form of cooperation according to the principle of voluntariness. We warmly welcome the desire and actions of national capitalists to accept socialist transformation. We must conscientiously help them transform into laborers in socialist society. The labor income of employees and employees in joint public-private enterprises and cooperative enterprises should not be reduced compared to before the socialist transformation, but should be gradually increased on the basis of working hard to improve business. To achieve this goal, it requires the joint efforts of all employees, engineering and technical personnel, and public and private personnel in joint public-private enterprises and cooperative enterprises. We should achieve this goal, and we can achieve this goal.

    关于私营工商业的社会主义改造问题
    ——国务院副总理陈云的发言
    关于一部分小商店、摊贩、挑贩的生活困难和业务安排的问题——关于适当解决小业主方面所存在的问题——关于公私合营企业的定息问题和公私关系的问题——关于公私合营企业中职工和私方人员的工资福利问题——关于企业改组方面的问题
    我现在就私营工商业的社会主义改造问题发表一些意见。
    在今年一月间，全国各地私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造运动达到了高潮。到目前为止，除了少数边疆地区以外，全部资本主义工商业都实行了公私合营。手工业一般地也都实现了各种不同程度的合作化。私营运输业或则实行了公私合营，或则实现了合作化。小商店和摊贩的改造有下列的几种不同形式：约有15％左右小商店参加了定息形式的公私合营；约有25％左右联合起几户或者几十户组成了统一经营共负盈亏的合作商店；约有60％左右现在或者正在替国营商业和供销合作社代购代销，或者在代销以外自己经营一部分国营商业和供销合作社没有经营的货物。
    工商业、手工业、运输业由私营的、资本主义的、个体的生产经营制度，转变为公私合营，转变为社会主义性质的合作社，这是一种带根本性质的改变。过去六年来人民政府和全国人民作了重大的努力，为这样的改变准备了充分的条件。企业的私有制向社会主义所有制的改变，这在世界上早已出现过，但是采用这样一种和平方法使全国工商界如此兴高采烈地来接受这种改变，这是史无前例的第一次。应该说，我们国家对私营工商业、手工业、私营运输业的社会主义改造，已经获得了伟大的胜利。这是社会主义的胜利，这是我们国家和全国人民走向繁荣、富强、幸福生活的胜利。全国人民应该像庆祝全国农业合作化一样、热烈地庆祝这个胜利。
    但是能否说，私营工商业、手工业、运输业的社会主义改造已经完成了呢？是否在改造中已经没有问题了呢？能否说改造中没有错误和缺点呢？不是的。一次批准公私合营和合作化，并不是改造已经完成，而还是改造的开始。在这个改造中还存在着许多问题，要求我们对它们逐个地加以解决。为了使我们能够从容地分期分批地解决这些问题，今年二月八日，国务院作了决定，要所有私营企业和手工业在批准公私合营和合作化以后，一律照旧经营，半年不动。应该承认，这样一种广泛、迅速而缺乏经验的改变，工作中不可能没有错误和缺点，错误和缺点是不少的。国务院的决定使我们有可能尽量地减少并且迅速地纠正这些错误和缺点。
    现在我要讲的是下面五个问题：一、关于一部分小商店、摊贩、挑贩的生活困难和业务安排的问题；二、关于适当解决小业主方面所存在的问题；三、关于公私合营企业的定息问题和公私关系的问题；四、关于公私合营企业中职工和私方人员的工资福利问题；五、关于企业改组方面的问题。
    第一，关于一部分小商店、摊贩、挑贩的生活困难和业务安排的问题。
    小商贩是商业中的独立劳动者，在全国约有二百四十万户，每家以四口人计算，就将近一千万人。前面说过，其中一部分参加了公私合营商店和合作商店；一部分替国营商业和供销合作社代购代销或部分自销。前者的营业额比之单独经营的时候是大大地增加了，他们的营业没有困难；现在有困难的是后者中间的一部分，他们的户数约占整个小商贩百分之二十五左右，少数地方有占百分之五十的。这些小商贩的困难来自两方面：一方面因为公私合营商店和合作商店的营业额的扩大，不仅包括了本年度比上一年度社会零售额增加了的部分和国营商业、供销合作社让出的部分；而且包括了那些从代购代销的小商贩营业额中挤出来的部分。另一方面是因为国营商业、供销合作社在这次社会主义改造的高潮中对小商贩的营业没有很好的照顾，缺乏全面安排；而且在小商贩的营业额开始下降的时候，也没有引起足够的重视，没有及时加以解决。
    在没有参加公私合营商店和合作商店的小商贩中，有很多人提出了四个要求：一是要求供应货源；二是要求借贷资金；三是要求简化税制；四是要求进入社会主义。我们认为这些要求都是合理的，是应该逐步加以解决的。
    现在政府准备采取一种办法，来解决他们的生活困难和业务安排问题。这个办法就是在自愿的原则下，逐步地、分期地、分行分业地、把他们组成分散经营、各负盈亏的合作小组。同时由各地商业部门在现有的国营商店、供销合作社和公私合营商店中指定一个商店，作为合作小组的批发店。这个批发店的任务，一是给合作小组供应商品、寻找货源；二是替合作小组向银行借款，解决资金困难；三是汇集合作小组每个成员应缴的税款，代向税局交纳。这种税款今后应该由税局实行严格的、一年不变的、定期定额的收税办法。这个批发店的开支，全部由国营商业或供销合作社支付，不由小商贩负担。商业部和供销合作社应该负起责任，按照各地小商贩不同的收入情况，区别小商贩中依靠商业为主要收入或以商业为辅助收入的不同情况，采取各种办法，使各地的各类小商贩都能获得必需的收入。同时，必须把安排小商贩，作为安排全部商业工作的重要部分。
    有人问：为什么政府不把全部小商贩都组成公私合营商店，或组成合作商店？大家知道，小商店、摊贩、挑贩中的广大部分是散布在居民区中间的。这些分散在居民区中的小商贩是我国商业中今后长期需要的一种经营服务形式。如果把它们统统收缩起来，合并组成集中的公私合营商店和合作商店，那就不便于居民的消费。如果仍让他们分散经营，而由国家给以固定工资，那就不能保持他们经营的积极性。同时，还有一部分小商贩，他们现在的收入高于公私合营商店和合作商店从业人员的收入，当他们不愿意参加的时候，也不能勉强地把他们合并到公私合营商店和合作商店中来。因此，安排这些小商贩的正确原则是既要照顾居民消费的方便，又要保持小商贩经营的积极性，使他们获得适当的收入。我们认为政府现在准备采取的办法，就是当前实现这个原则的最好办法，同时，这也是今后相当时期内实现小商贩的社会主义要求的合理办法。采取这种办法，可以使广大的分散的小商贩，经过批发店领导合作小组的形式，同社会主义经济密切地联系起来，并且使小商贩从国营商业、供销合作社领取代购代销的、计件工资性质的手续费。这样，就能够使这些小商贩逐步地成为社会主义商业的一个组成部分。
    第二，关于适当解决小业主方面所存在的问题。
    我国的工厂、商店、运输企业有大的，也有小的。大的资本主义的企业在生产和业务上占有特别重要的地位，这是很明显的；但是，雇佣少量职工的小的企业的数量，远远多于大的企业。目前，不仅大企业实行了公私合营，而且小企业也实行了公私合营。这就是说，大量的小业主参加了公私合营。小业主的地位，在解放以前是极不稳定的，在资本主义的大鱼吃小鱼的竞争中，小企业时刻遭受着破产的威胁，因而，小业主随时存在着失业的危险。那时小业主中有为数不小的一部分人，非但没有可靠的利润收入，而且常常得不到正常的工资。解放以后，我国的小企业的业务得到了政府的安排，大鱼吃小鱼的威胁早已不存在。公私合营以后，他们可以得到定息的收入，而且只要好好地工作，他们再也没有失业的威胁了。正因为这样，全国的小业主热烈地欢迎公私合营。但是，小业主的定息收入不多，工资也不算高，因此，政府业务部门对于那些与小业主生活密切有关的问题，应该给以妥善的解决。
    首先是房屋问题，房屋是小业主生活资料中的主要部分。国务院1956年2月8日对公私合营企业财产清理估价问题的规定中，曾经指出：凡属家店不分或者家厂不分的小企业的房屋处置问题，应该按照业主的意见办理。现在应该再具体规定，凡属家店、家厂相连的企业，除了原有的铺面、厂房、栈房作为合营资财以外，其他的房屋都应该作为生活资料归业主所有。凡属处理房屋方面有错误、缺点的地方，必须切实改正。
    其次，许多小业主的家属，原来参加企业的辅助劳动的，公私合营后应该照旧吸收他们为辅助劳动，或作其他的适当安排。
    第三，关于公私合营企业的定息问题和公私关系问题。
    关于定息问题，国务院1956年2月8日对公私合营企业实行定息办法曾经规定息率由一厘到六厘，即年息百分之一到百分之六，并且指出在不同地区、不同行业以至同一行业的不同企业中，可以采取不同的息率。五个月来，许多方面的意见都认为在规定息率的时候，需要简单一些和放宽一些。我们认为这种意见是正确的、可行的。在息率方面，我们认为可以不分工商、不分大小、不分盈余户亏损户、不分地区、不分行业统一规定为年息五厘。即年息百分之五。个别需要提高息率的企业，仍然可以超过五厘。过去早已公私合营，但是采取按比例办法分配利润的企业，同新合营的企业一样定息五厘。过去早已公私合营，并且已经采取定息办法的企业，如果它们的息率超过五厘，照旧支付，不予降低；如果它们的息率不到五厘，提高到五厘。各地公私合营企业和政府的业务部门，应该积极准备，力求在本年七、八月间发给利息一次。
    关于公私关系问题。全国资本主义工商业实行公私合营以后，在大量的公私合营企业中，公私双方的代表共事得好或者不好的问题，是关联到企业生产经营的一个大问题，也是关联到能否发挥资方人员在生产中的作用和能否有效地把资方人员改造成为劳动者的重要问题。
    这个重要问题的解决，目前应该从下列几个方面着手：
    首先应该看到，中国的民族资本家和私营工商业者，对企业的生产技术和经营管理是有经验的，他们对于我国工商业的管理工作是有用处的。对于他们的生产技术和经营管理知识，我们应该进行分析，凡属不合理的部分，应该逐步加以改变；凡属合理的部分，不但在公私合营企业中应该继续发挥它的作用，而且在国营企业中也应该充分加以运用。我们应该把资本主义工商业、手工业的生产技术和经营管理知识中一切有用的东西，看成是民族遗产，把它保留下来。吸收这些有用的民族遗产是我们的责任，对于这些民族遗产采取否定一切的粗暴态度是错误的。
    其次，大量的资本主义工商业在今年一月才转为公私合营大量的资方人员和公股代表在企业内部都还缺少双方共事的经验。为了使双方共事共得好，各地的党政机关应该领导业务部门经常总结这一方面的经验，并且根据这些经验的总结，逐步地定出公私双方共事的制度和办法。上级业务部门规定的业务上的方针、政策和办法，应该使企业中公私双方有关的管理人员，都能熟悉。各地应该召集公股代表和私股代表分别举行会议，收集意见，进行教育，解决他们在处理公私关系中所遇到的困难。有时，并且应该召集公私代表在一起举行会议，向他们进行教育。中央和省市两级政府工商业务部门的主管人员应该定期地同当地工商联、同业公会和民建会的人员举行座谈会，交换公私关系中各个方面的有关问题。
    再次，公私合营企业中公私关系的改进，还必须向职工群众进行教育，说明团结资方人员，发挥他们的长处，把资方人员改造成为劳动者，是有利于工人阶级和全国人民的。同时，也必须使资方人员采取积极态度同公股代表进行合作，同职工群众加强团结。如果职工群众对资方人员过去的行为有不满的地方，资方人员就应该在适当场合主动地恰当地进行自我批评，公股代表也应该协助资方人员在职工中进行解释，使全体职工与公私管理人员团结一致进行生产和经营。应该看到，这种团结要经过一定的过程，这是一个对于职工群众、公股代表和资方人员的教育过程，也是把资方人员改造成为劳动者的过程。我们相信经过各个方面的努力，公私合营企业中的团结，一定可以实现。
    第四，关于公私合营企业中职工和私方人员的工资福利问题。
    公私合营企业中许多职工写信给有关机关，说他们企业中的工资待遇高低差别太大；说他们的工资比国营企业的工资低，要求政府加以调整。根据现在的初步材料看来，有些公私合营企业的职工工资比同类的国营企业的工资标准高，也有些合营企业特别是小工厂和商店，比同类的国营企业的工资标准低。大家知道，私营企业之间原来的工资标准是极不一致的，各种待遇也很不相同，要把公私合营企业中过去遗留下来的极不一致的工资待遇，立即统一起来，或者把公私合营企业的工资待遇立即同国营企业的工资标准统一起来，都是不可能的。全国解放将近七年，国营企业的工资标准也还没有完全统一。我们应该看到公私合营企业工资标准的逐步调整，需要有几年的时间。至于目前因为企业合并而产生的、同一企业中相同工作的职工所得工资待遇相差过大的问题，这是应该在可能范围内加以调整的。调整的方针应当是，在公私合营企业中职工的工资同当地同类的国营企业职工的工资比较起来，高了的不降低，低了的根据生产情况和企业的可能，分期地、逐步地增加。中央和地方的有关部门，应该在今年的下半年提出一个方案，经过批准后，予以实行。
    许多私营企业的生产安全设备和卫生设备原来是很差的，在合营以后应该逐步加以改进。
    手工业生产合作社、运输合作社的社员的工资收入，不应该低于他们入社以前的劳动收入，而应该在努力生产改善经营的基础上，做到比合作化以前的劳动收入有所增加。如果有些手工业生产合作社、运输合作社因为提取公积金过多，而使社员收入比加入合作社以前的劳动所得减少了的话，那么就应该减少公积金来增加社员的工资。合作商店如果也因为提取公积金过多，而使工作人员的工资过低了的，同样应该减少公积金，把工资增加到适当的程度。
    公私合营企业中资方人员的工资，也将根据对职工工资的处理原则来加以调整。
    公私合营企业私方人员的疾病医疗，应该加以帮助。企业核定资产在两千元以下的私方人员，本人的疾病医疗和病假期内的工资支付办法，都应该按照本企业中职工的待遇同样办理。同时，企业核定资产虽然超过了两千元而有困难的私方人员，本人的疾病医疗和病假期内的工资支付办法，也可以参照本企业职工的待遇办理。
    许多工商界人士提议，有关方面共同协作，筹集一批款项，以便对工商业者发生困难的时候进行救济。我们赞成这个提议。希望全国工商联草拟办法，提出方案，政府方面可以给以协助。
    第五，关于企业改组方面的问题。
    政府对私营工商业社会主义改造的计划，本来是准备用两年时间，在全国各地按行按业、分期分批地来进行的。今年一月工商业社会主义改造高潮到来以后，政府改变了原定计划，在全国各地一次批准了私营工商业、手工业、运输业的社会主义改造。为了适应当时的要求，这种改变是必要的。但是这样迅速的改变，使许多业务部门和许多地区来不及积累全行业公私合营的经验，因此就在敲锣打鼓的那些日子，许多地方有不少的工厂、手工作坊、商店、运输业纷纷合并，有些不应该合并的合并了，有些可以合并的也合并得太大了。总之，是并得过多，统一计算盈亏的单位太大。国务院二月八日的决定停止了这种盲目合并的趋势。
    私营工商业、手工业社会主义改造中出现的另一个问题，是人为地把工商业的原来的供销关系和协作关系割裂了。工业、手工业、商业、运输业的社会主义改造工作，不能由一个部门管理，而只能由各个业务部门分工管理。这种分工管理是必要的，合理的，问题是发生在分工管理的部门之间，缺少工作上的密切配合。同时有些企业应该隶属那一个部门管理，也还划分得不适当，因此，工商业的原来供销关系和协作关系出现了割裂的现象。例如，同一个工业的行业中，过去对于大小企业的生产是一起安排的，它们在业务上是有密切的联系；但是现在因为四人以上的企业归工业部门改造，三人以下的企业归手工业部门改造，而工业和手工业两个管理部门对他们生产业务的安排，步调常常不一致，因此，他们之间原有的关系被分割了。再如，原来商业中的服装鞋帽店是有固定加工的手工作坊的，在社会主义改造中，服装鞋帽商店归商业部门改造，承制服装鞋帽的手工作坊归手工业部门改造，而不少承制服装鞋帽的手工作坊，又在这次手工业合作化运动中被合并了，这样就使商店和手工作坊之间原有的加工关系中断了。像这样不合理的割裂现象还很多，其中以手工业和各个方面的矛盾也最多。为了改正这种人为的割裂，政府的有关部门正在采取措施加以调整。
    我们认为企业改组工作，不能性急，必须经过充分准备。国务院半年不动的决定，制止了当时的某些混乱，使业务部门有时间来研究和摸索企业改组方面的经验和办法。但是，这不是说半年期满以后，各行各业就都能够进行改组。不是的，所有工业、手工业、商业、运输业的企业改组，都不应该受时间的限制，都必须经过充分准备，都必须是各行各业分批分期地逐步改造，都必须结合生产安排并在有利于生产的条件下进行。目前各地和各业务部门的任务是对于没有改组的企业准备各行各业的改组方案，对于合并错了的企业，则应该有准备地逐步进行调整。
    对公私合营企业改组和私方人员安排问题，应该注意到这样一个事实，就是，职工和私方人员对原来私营企业和私方人员的情况是要比公股代表熟悉得多。由他们提出的企业改组和人事安排的方案，一般是适当的。因此，一切公私合营企业中的业务改组和私方人事的安排，可以由相应的工商联、同业公会和私方人员先提意见。已经改组了的企业，过去没有征求过私方人员的意见，而私方人员又认为业务改组和人员安排方面有不妥当的地方，应该向私方人员重行征求一次意见，只要是处置不当，就应该加以改变。同样的，业务改组和人事安排也必需征求职工和技术人员的意见。我们应该吸收各方面的意见，以便把企业改组和人事安排的工作做好。
    大家知道，私营工商业、手工业、私营运输业的社会主义改造，是一件复杂的巨大的工作，过去五个月我们的工作已经获得很大的成绩，但是今后还有许多问题要解决，许多工作要做得更好。我们的社会主义改造工作，必须达到这样的目的：公私合营的企业必须比资本主义的企业办得好，合作社的企业必须比个人经营的企业办得好。对于各种各样的个体经济，都应该按照自愿原则用合作化的形式帮助他们逐步地组织起来。我们对民族资本家接受社会主义改造的愿望和行动，表示热烈地欢迎。我们要认真地帮助他们改造成为社会主义社会的劳动者。公私合营企业、合作企业的职工和从业人员的劳动收入，不应该比社会主义改造以前降低，而应该在努力生产改善经营的基础上逐步有所增加。要达到这样的目的，需要公私合营企业和合作企业中全体职工、工程技术人员、公私双方人员的共同努力。我们应该达到这个目的，我们可以达到这个目的。
