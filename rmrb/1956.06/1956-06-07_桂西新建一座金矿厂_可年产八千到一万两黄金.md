    A New Gold Mine Factory Built in Western Guangxi
    Can Produce Eight Thousand to Ten Thousand Taels of Gold Annually
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th. A factory for processing gold ore—the Tianyang Gold Mine Factory—is under construction in the Western Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture. At present, the factory's basic construction engineering is in a stage of intense construction, and various machines and equipment ordered from Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou and other places have been successively shipped back. It is expected that this gold mine factory can be put into production by the end of July this year.
    The construction of the Tianyang Gold Mine Factory began in March this year, and small-scale manual mining is already underway. After the mine factory is completed, it can produce eight thousand to ten thousand taels of gold annually.
    According to a survey by the Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry last year, the gold reserves in this mining area are abundant and have great mining value.

    桂西新建一座金矿厂
    可年产八千到一万两黄金
    新华社南宁6日电　桂西僮族自治州正在新建一座处理金矿石的工厂——田阳金矿厂。现在，这个金矿厂的厂房基本建设工程，已经进入紧张施工阶段，向上海、沈阳、广州等地订购的各种机器设备，已经陆续运回。预计今年七月底，这个金矿厂可以投入生产。
    田阳金矿厂是在今年三月份开始动工兴建的，目前已经进行小规模的人工开采。矿厂建成以后，每年可以生产八千到一万两黄金。
    据广西省工业厅去年的勘查，这个矿区金的藏量丰富，很有开采价值。
