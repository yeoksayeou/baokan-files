Explanation of "Factory Safety and Health Regulations"
Minister of Labor, Ma Wenrui

I. Why Formulate the "Factory Safety and Health Regulations"?

In recent years, factories and enterprises have taken many measures in safety and health work, and labor conditions have improved. To a certain extent, the safety and health of employees have been guaranteed, which has encouraged the production enthusiasm of employees and improved labor productivity. However, there are still many problems in factory safety and health work: the factory yards and workplaces of many factories are dirty and disorderly, raw materials, finished products, and semi-finished products are piled up randomly, and pedestrian walkways are blocked; auxiliary production facilities such as bathrooms, toilets, and locker rooms are also unclean and unsanitary; the production and hygiene work of many factories is carried out very poorly, window glass is not cleaned for a long time, lighting is insufficient, natural ventilation is poor, and the efficiency of mechanical ventilation equipment is not high. What is particularly serious is that for the production of harmful vapors, gases, and dust, there is a lack of effective measures such as closure, ventilation, and dust removal; in many factories, the operating conditions of employees are extremely unsafe, electrical equipment has poor insulation, the voltage of portable lamps does not meet safety requirements, hand-held power tools are not grounded or connected to zero, and special machinery such as boilers and cranes lack necessary safety devices. There is even a lack of simple protective devices such as gear covers and guardrails, or the devices are removed and not used.

Facts have proved that factories that are unclean, disorderly, and unsafe are most prone to accidents and diseases, which seriously hinders the improvement of labor productivity. In order to quickly change the above situation and ensure that employees engage in production under safe and hygienic labor conditions, it is entirely necessary to regulate factory safety and health management in the form of regulations.

II. The Nature and Content of These Regulations

These Regulations are provisions on safety and health management, which put forward requirements to factories on the management of factory yards, workplaces, machinery and electrical equipment, boilers and gas cylinders, gases, dusts and dangerous goods, water supply, auxiliary production facilities, personal protective equipment, etc. Existing factories should take improvement measures in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations on the basis of reality; newly built factories should generally implement these Regulations; as for the design of new and rebuilt factories, they should be implemented in accordance with relevant design standards.

There are many problems in factory safety and health, and these Regulations only stipulate common problems. Therefore, special problems belonging to certain enterprises, such as the layout of towers and pipelines in chemical plants, fire prevention in oil plants, and explosion prevention in explosive factories, are not included in these Regulations. As for the safety problems of machinery, cranes, electrical appliances, boilers, oxygen cylinders, and acetylene devices, although they are common to many enterprises, these problems are very complicated and should be subject to separate regulations. These Regulations only stipulate the main problems among them.

These Regulations do not specify the specific standards for the lighting area of ​​production sites, the illuminance of artificial lighting, and the maximum allowable content of toxic gases and dust. Each department can specify them when formulating separate detailed rules.

III. The Scope of Application of These Regulations

The large-scale factories mentioned in these Regulations refer to factories with mechanical power and a total number of workers and staff of more than sixteen; or factories without mechanical power and a total number of workers and staff of more than thirty-one (see the Concise Explanation of Terms in the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China).

The equipment and production conditions of locomotive depots, vehicle depots, and mining ground transportation, repair and assembly sections of the railway system are similar to those of factories. Therefore, these Regulations also apply to these departments.

    关于“工厂安全卫生规程”的说明
    劳动部长　马文瑞
    一、为什么要制订“工厂安全卫生规程”
    几年来，工厂企业在安全卫生工作方面采取了不少措施，劳动条件有了改善，在一定程度上保证了职工的安全和健康，因而鼓舞了职工的生产热情，提高了劳动生产率。但是，在工厂安全卫生工作中也还存在有许多问题：许多工厂的厂院和工作场所存在着肮脏零乱，原材料、成品、半成品乱堆乱放，人行道阻塞等现象，浴室、厕所、更衣室等生产辅助设施也不清洁、不卫生；许多工厂的生产卫生工作进行得很差，窗户的玻璃长期不加擦拭，灯光照明不足，自然通风不良，机械通风设备使用效率不高，特别严重的是对散放有害健康的蒸汽、气体及粉尘的生产，缺乏密闭，通风、排尘等有效措施；在不少工厂中，职工的操作条件是极不安全的，电气设备绝缘不良，行灯的电压不合乎安全要求，手持电动工具没有接地或接零，锅炉、吊车等特种机械缺乏必要的安全装置等，甚至还缺乏牙轮罩、防护栏杆等简单的防护装置，或者有了装置而拆除不用。
    事实证明：凡是不清洁、无秩序和不安全的工厂，最易发生伤亡事故和疾病，使劳动生产率的提高受到严重障碍。为了迅速改变上述情况，保障职工在安全和卫生的劳动条件下从事生产，用规程的形式对工厂的安全卫生管理工作加以规定，是完全必要的。
    二、本规程的性质和内容
    本规程是有关安全卫生管理方面的规定，向工厂提出关于厂院、工作场所、机械和电气设备、锅炉和气瓶、气体、粉尘和危险物品、供水、生产辅助设施、个人防护用品等管理上的要求。现有工厂应在现实的基础上，按照本规程规定，采取改进措施；建成后的新工厂，一般应当按照本规程执行；至于新建、改建工厂的设计，应该按照有关的设计标准执行。
    工厂安全卫生方面的问题很多，本规程只对具有共同性的问题加以规定。因此，属于某些企业的特殊问题，如化学工厂的塔和管道的布置，石油厂的防火，炸药工厂的防爆等，就没有包括在本规程内。至于机械、吊车、电气、锅炉、氧气瓶和乙炔装置等安全问题，虽然是许多企业所共有的，但由于这些问题很复杂，应另有单行规定，本规程只对其中的主要问题作了规定。
    本规程对生产场所的采光面积，人工照明的照度，有毒气体、粉尘最高允许含量等标准没有作具体的规定。各部门可以在制订单行的细则时，加以具体规定。
    三、本规程的适用范围
    本规程所说的大型工厂系指具有机械动力，工人和职员总数在十六人以上的工厂；或者没有机械动力，工人和职员总数在三十一人以上的工厂（参阅中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的名词简释）。
    铁路系统的机务段、车辆段和矿山地面的运输、修配等工段的设备和生产条件都和工厂类似，因此，本规程也适用于这些部门。
