On June 1st, over 170 basic flood reporting stations along the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River sent flood report telegrams to the Huai River Harnessing Committee like snowflakes.

On this day, the water level at Bengbu on the Huai River's mainstream reached 15.56 meters, 3.28 meters higher than the same period last year. A heavy rain that occurred in the Huai River area more than ten days ago caused a flood peak in the Huai River's mainstream, and this flood peak has yet to recede.

    淮河干流洪峰迄未消退
    六月一日，淮河上中下游一百七十多个基本报汛站报汛电报，像雪片似的发到治淮委员会来。
    一日这天，淮河干流蚌埠的水位达十五点五六公尺，比去年同期高出三点二八公尺。十几天前淮河地区的一场暴雨，使淮河干流出现了洪峰，这个洪峰迄未消退。
