Peking University Holds Student Science Conference

    (Our dispatch) Peking University's first student science conference has concluded. On the 3rd, the school issued commemorative badges to all the authors who participated in the conference.

    The student science conference was held in late May. This conference received a total of 185 papers, of which 59 were reported at various departmental branch meetings. Chen Tianquan, a sophomore in the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, wrote "Riemann Integrability on Linear Topological Spaces," which has some originality, and the teaching and research section plans to recommend the paper to the Academy of Sciences for review. Lin Zhichun of the Biology Department spent two summers raising tadpoles with several different foods, resulting in several different metamorphoses. He wrote the paper "Metamorphosis of the Northern Narrow-mouthed Toad under Different Feeding Conditions." Li Wanchun, a sophomore in the Chinese Department, used to be a worker with only elementary school education. After entering university, due to his diligent study and research, not only did he achieve all excellent grades, but he also wrote a paper on the poet Li Bai. The paper made a more comprehensive and detailed analysis and evaluation of Li Bai's poetry, criticized some idealistic viewpoints in the research of Li Bai's poetry, and put forward more profound insights into the aspects of Li Bai's poetry that reflect social life and the author's political ideals.

    北京大学举行学生科学报告会
    本报讯　北京大学第一次学生科学报告会已经结束。三日，学校发给所有参加报告会的论文作者以纪念章。
    学生科学报告会是五月下旬举行的。这次报告会共收到论文185篇，提到各系分会上报告的有五十九篇。数学力学系二年级陈天权写的“线性拓扑空间上的黎曼可积性”一文，具有一定的创见，教研室准备把论文推荐给科学院审查。生物系林志春花了两个暑假的时间，用几种不同的食物饲养蝌蚪，结果得出几种不同的变态。他写出了“北方狭口蛙在不同饲养条件下的变态”的论文。中文系二年级李万春，过去是工人，只有小学程度，进大学后，由于他刻苦学习和钻研，不但成绩获得了全部优等，而且写出了一篇关于诗人李白的论文。论文对李白诗歌进行了较全面、细致的分析和评价，批判了有关李白诗歌研究中的一些唯心主义观点，对李白诗歌中反映了社会生活及作者的政治理想等方面，提出了比较深刻的见解。
