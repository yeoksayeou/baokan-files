    Making the Flowers of Drama Bloom More, Better, and More Beautiful
    ——Speech by Representative Lang Xianfen
    I am a young Lü opera actress from Shandong Province. Thanks to the cultivation of the Party and the government, I, such a young opera worker, have the opportunity to attend and speak at this conference, which makes me deeply realize that this is only possible under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I feel unspeakable excitement and gratitude!
    I listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget at the conference. In the 1956 budget, expenditures on cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings increased by 25.34% compared to the previous year, fully demonstrating the importance the Party and government attach to cultural and educational undertakings. In addition to fully endorsing this report, I am particularly excited about the increase in cultural and educational expenditures!
    Lü opera is one of the ethnic heritages of Shandong Province. Although its history is only 40 or 50 years, it is deeply loved by the working people because it is rooted in the countryside. In the old society, like other opera genres, it was suppressed by the reactionary ruling class, and the artists had a difficult life and were almost eliminated. After liberation, the Party and government attached great importance to opera work. Under the implementation of Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," Lü opera has also been appropriately developed in Shandong. In 1952, the Shandong Provincial Lü Opera Troupe was established (initially the Shandong Provincial Opera Troupe, later renamed the Lü Opera Troupe), based on the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Local Opera Research Office, and members of the province's cultural and labor troupes (teams) were selected to form the troupe together. Since the vast majority of the troupe members are young literary and art workers, it can be said that most of them are young intellectuals. In the beginning, everyone had a period of ideological confusion, mistakenly believing that learning local opera had no future and was a shameful thing; some comrades even suspected whether it was a mistake in policy implementation to choose young literary and art workers to learn local opera; and some fantasized about creating new operas. It wasn't until after the Party rectification and literary and art rectification, and a serious study of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," that we gained a preliminary understanding of the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, reversed the prejudice against local opera, and also gained a basic training in business through hard study and practice. Since then, all the comrades in the troupe have strengthened their beliefs and established the determination to study Lü opera well. In the winter of 1953, it was first performed in Jinan and was unexpectedly warmly welcomed by the vast audience. This was not only a great encouragement to us young opera workers, but more importantly, it provided these young comrades with a profound practical education and increased everyone's confidence in the cause.
    In 1954, participation in the Shandong Provincial Performance and the East China Opera Performance all received awards and encouragement. Especially last autumn's performance in the capital, although our programs were few and not good enough, received the attention of the capital's literary and art circles and the love of the audience. The written comments and the enlightenment from the symposiums gave us a great education. In the early spring of this year, we went to Korea to comfort our most beloved people and were equally warmly welcomed by the volunteers. After returning to China, we performed in several major cities in the Northeast and also received good results. All of this experience made us deeply realize the brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," and also made us understand that only by earnestly studying the Party's literary and art policies can we do a good job in business and be welcomed by the masses in performances.
    In the past few years, although we have done some work in the improvement of Lü opera and have achieved some modest results, we feel that it is still far from enough. We should strengthen our work. In the leaping progress of the motherland's socialist construction, our opera workers are far behind the objective needs in the excavation and sorting out of traditional repertoire, as well as the creation and rehearsal of new dramas reflecting new people, new things, and modern life. We must continue to work hard so as not to fail the cultivation of the Party and the government and the expectations of the broad masses.
    I believe that local opera should not only strive to excavate, sort out, and perform excellent traditional repertoire, but also try to learn new dramas that can perform modern life. However, if we do not pay attention to the essence of the original opera genre, do not properly sort out the excellent repertoire of the original opera genre on an appropriate basis, and do not study and absorb its various excellent traditional performance methods well, then it will be difficult to succeed in creating new dramas of a certain opera genre—new dramas that express modern life. The Lü Opera Troupe once rehearsed the modern drama "Li Ersao Remarries." After many discussions and revisions and the actors' in-depth experience in the countryside to understand the thoughts, feelings, and lives of the peasants, and absorb their valuable opinions and criticisms, this is not only absolutely necessary for us to create the image of the working people, but also a major gain in the ideological transformation of these young intellectuals. Learning from experienced old predecessors, learning from traditional performance skills, and appropriately using traditional performance skills to enrich the creation of characters—these are a few experiences of our "Li Ersao Remarries" in performance, which also made me deeply feel that only by learning from the excellent traditional art that the masses love to see and hear, and learning from life, can we be loved by the broad audience.
    In the past few years, in the reform of opera, vigorously implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" has already achieved very good results. Lü opera is a young genre of local opera in Shandong Province, with a shallow history and no very complete artistic specifications. It especially needs to learn from the opera genres of various places, absorb its repertoire, performance methods, music, etc., to enrich and enrich it, and it is also necessary to be close to the broad working masses at all times and listen to their opinions and criticisms. We should strengthen political and business learning, pay attention to artistic practice, and strive to become socialist realist opera workers, so as to better serve our socialist construction.
    As a young actor in a young opera genre, I am willing to learn from advanced opera workers with a very sincere heart, and jointly serve the broad people with the performing arts of drama, so that the flowers of our drama will bloom more, better, and more beautifully!

    使戏剧的花朵开得更多、更好、更美丽
    ——郎咸芬代表的发言
    我是山东省的一个青年的吕剧演员，由于党和政府的培养，使我这样年幼的戏曲工作者也得在大会上出席发言，使我深深的体会到只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下才有可能，我心里有说不出的兴奋和感激！
    我在大会上听取了李先念副总理的关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告。在1956年的预算中，文化教育科学卫生事业的支出，比上年增加了25.34％，充分说明了党和政府对于文化教育事业的重视。我除却对于这个报告全部拥护外，对文教事业费支出的增长，尤感兴奋！
    吕剧是山东省民族遗产的剧种之一，历史虽只四、五十年，但因它扎根在农村中，深为劳动人民所喜爱，在旧社会里也与其他剧种一样，受到反动统治阶级的压迫，艺人们生活困难，几乎要消灭无闻，解放后党和政府对于戏曲工作极为重视，在贯彻执行毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针下，吕剧在山东也得到了适当的发展。1952年成立了山东省吕剧团（初为山东省歌剧团，后改为吕剧团），以山东省文联地方戏曲研究室作基础，选拔了全省的文工团（队）员共同组成了这个剧团。由于绝大多数的团员都是年纪很轻的青年文艺工作者，也可以说大部分是年青的小知识分子。在起初时，大家思想上曾有一度的混乱，错误地认为学地方小戏没有前途，是见不得人的事；甚至有的同志对于选择青年文艺工作者学地方戏，怀疑是否犯了执行政策的错误；有的则空想搞新歌剧。直到经过整党和文艺整风，又郑重地学习了毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”以后，使我们对文艺为工农兵服务的方向有了初步的认识，扭转了轻视地方戏曲的偏见，同时在业务的苦学苦练上也获得了一点基础的训练。从此全团的同志们坚定了信念，树立了好好学习吕剧的决心。1953年冬在济南首次公演，出乎意料地受到广大观众的热烈欢迎。这不仅对我们这些年青的戏曲工作者是一个很大的鼓舞，更重要的是使我们这些青年同志们受到了一次深刻的实际教育，更增加了大家对于事业的信心。
    1954年参加山东省会演及华东戏曲会演，都得到了奖励和鼓舞。特别是去年秋天来首都演出，虽然我们的节目少，不够好，但受到了首都文艺界的重视和观众的热爱，文字上的评论，座谈会上的启发，使我们获得了很大的教育。今年初春，我们赴朝鲜慰问我们最可爱的人，同样受到了志愿军的热烈欢迎。回国后又在东北几个大城市演出，也收到良好的效果。这一切经过，使我们更深切的体会到毛主席的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针的英明正确，也使我们明白，只有在切实学习党的文艺政策的基础上，才能搞好业务，才能在演出上得到群众欢迎。
    几年来，我们虽在吕剧的改进工作中做过一些工作，也有点滴的成绩，但我们觉得还是非常不够。应该加强我们的工作。在祖国社会主义建设飞跃前进中，我们戏曲工作者在发掘和整理传统剧目，以及反映新人新事、现代生活的新剧的创作与排演上，都大大落后于客观的需要。我们还必须积极努力，才不至辜负了党和政府的培养以及广大群众的期望。
    我以为地方戏曲一方面须要努力发掘整理和演出优良的传统剧目，一方面也在尽心学习可以表演现代生活的新剧。但如对原来剧种的精华不加重视，不在适当的基础上对原剧种的优秀剧目加以整理，对它的各项优良传统的表现方法不好好学习、吸收，那么在创造某一种剧种的新剧——表现现代生活的新剧上，也难获得成功。吕剧团曾排演过现代剧“李二嫂改嫁”，经过多少次的研讨修改与演员们深入农村体验了解农民的思想、感情、生活，吸取他们宝贵的意见和批评，这不仅对我们在创造劳动人民的形象上有它绝对的必要，在对这些年青的小知识分子思想改造上也是一次重大的收获。向富有经验的老前辈们学习，向传统表演技巧学习，适当地运用传统的表演技巧来丰富人物的创造，这是我们“李二嫂改嫁”在演出上略有收获的几点体会，从而也使我深深地感到只有向群众所喜闻乐见的优秀传统艺术学习，向生活学习，才能受到广大观众的喜爱。
    几年来在戏曲改革工作中，大力贯彻“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，已有了很好的成绩。吕剧是山东省地方戏的一个年青的剧种，历史浅，没有很完整的艺术规格，尤其需要向各地方的剧种学习，吸收其剧目、表演方法、音乐等等，来丰富充实它，更要时时与广大劳动群众接近，听取他们的意见与批评。我们应加强政治和业务学习，注意艺术实践，使自己努力成为社会主义现实主义的戏曲工作者，更好地为我们社会主义建设服务。
    做为一个年青剧种的一个年青的演员，我以十分恳切的心情，愿意向先进的戏曲工作者学习，共同以戏剧的表演艺术为广大人民服务，使我们戏剧的花朵开的更多、更好、更美丽！
