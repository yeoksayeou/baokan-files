    This is reported by our newspaper from Hangzhou: In the past year, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Health has received more than 2,000 secret, effective, and simple prescriptions contributed by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners from various regions. The Department of Health organized TCM physicians in Hangzhou to research and compile these prescriptions into the first volume of the "Collection of Secret and Effective Prescriptions of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Zhejiang Province." This book contains over 1,700 secret and simple prescriptions, categorized into nine sections and seventy-eight classes, including internal medicine, gynecology, pediatrics, surgery, traumatology, acupuncture, ENT, miscellaneous diseases, and compound formulas. Most of these prescriptions are easy to use, and the medicines used are inexpensive and readily available. Some of them have been proven highly effective through years of clinical application by TCM physicians. The collection also includes more than 260 single-herb prescriptions with good therapeutic effects. The book includes the name of the prescription, method of preparation, usage, and source for each prescription.
