This is a Beijing-style courtyard. At the entrance of the courtyard, there is a white sign that reads "Xidan District Fourth Nursery." Every morning around seven o'clock, it begins to be filled with joy. Uncle Yang, riding his bicycle, brings the children in batches from various places to the nursery. When the nannies hear that the children have arrived, they quickly run out. The children, seeing the nannies, eagerly say, "Good morning, Auntie!" The nannies also busy themselves replying, "Good morning, children!" After getting off the bicycle, they dash into the gate like little swallows.

Upon entering the courtyard, it seems like an ordinary citizen's residence. Only after entering the house will you feel that it possesses many characteristics of a Beijing street nursery. The two southern rooms are the activity rooms for the younger class; the relatively spacious three northern rooms are the activity rooms for the older and middle classes. Many colored paper balls are hung in the room. All around the walls are pasted the children's works: airplanes cut from colored paper, apples drawn with crayons, etc., red, green, and dazzling. On the east side of the room is a large board bed, with small quilts folded neatly on it; this is where the children rest at noon. Not long ago, the nursery added a batch of brand-new small tables and chairs. These "belongings" seem very simple, but their origin is truly hard-won!

This was already the autumn of 1952. Li Yuzhen (the current station director) had just returned from studying at the Beijing Nursery Training Class. With the help of the street women's representative meeting and the masses, she was determined to set up a nursery. After much difficulty, she found a few rooms, and the masses donated some household utensils: bed boards, cooking pots, dining tables, and a few sets of bowls and chopsticks. Then, they began to enroll a few children. In this way, a nursery was barely established. However, at that time, Beijing was experiencing a severe housing shortage. They always had to move after less than a few months, sometimes even less than a few days. Once, they couldn't find a place to move to, and it looked like the nursery was about to close. At this time, Li Yuzhen often remembered what her teachers told her when she was studying at the nursery training class: "There will always be difficulties in undertaking a cause. In revolutionary work, you cannot bow your head to difficulties." Thinking of these words, her confidence grew stronger. So, she went to the district women's federation to discuss the matter. Here, she received active support and encouragement. That same day, the district women's federation sent two comrades to help her solve the housing problem, borrowing two rooms on the street. However, these two rooms were too dilapidated. Once, not long after the children left the station, a loud crash was heard. A large pillar fell from the roof of the outer room, landing right on the children's bed. How dangerous! From then on, they never let the children stay in that room again. In wind or rain, the station left at most six children behind, and the other children were carried or piggybacked home by another nanny to sleep at noon every day. It was not until the winter of 1954, thanks to the strong help of the district government, that they moved to their current location and settled down.

When it was first established, they only had one station director, one nanny, and eight children. Now, the nursery has grown to six nannies and fifty children. In addition, there are more than fifty people who have already registered and requested admission.

The children here often like to sing this song: "The nursery is my home, the nannies love me like my mother. The nannies tell me stories, we sing and dance and laugh." That's right. Over the years, the nursery has encountered many difficulties. However, the nannies always find ways, never willing to let the children feel any grievance. Even when material conditions were at their most difficult, the nannies preferred to bring food and vegetables from home rather than fail to ensure that each child could eat meat, eggs, and enough vegetables every day.

Now, of course, the situation is even different.

At eight o'clock in the morning, the children's happy and joyful day begins.

Morning exercises are the earliest class of the day, and all the children in the station participate. As soon as the nanny calls out "Children, morning exercises!" the courtyard immediately becomes lively. At 9:30, the older, middle, and younger classes begin to separate for classes. Some go to sing, some go to dance, and some go to do their homework. There is a child named Chen Yanqing, who is seven years old this year. He likes to paint very much. If you take him to Tiananmen Square, he will draw a Tiananmen for you when he comes back; if you take him to the park, he will draw some flowers, plants, and trees for you when he comes back. Once, everyone went out of the city to play, and a team of camels happened to pass by. After returning, he started drawing camels.

One afternoon, Ren Shimin, a child from the older class, found a few long and short pieces of wood in the yard. So, he chose two long ones and one short one and made a single-winged airplane out of them. But he felt that it was not good enough just like that. At this time, a child from the younger class walked over, and he said to her, "Little sister, lend me two pigtail ropes, and I will tie them up for you to play with, okay?" The little girl immediately agreed. Before long, a small airplane was made according to Ren Shimin's idea.

The distribution of children's expenses in general Beijing street nurseries is mostly seven yuan for food and six yuan for miscellaneous expenses, but this station has always adhered to the principle of distributing eight yuan for food and five yuan for miscellaneous expenses. Here, according to the guidance of the Maternal and Child Health Institute, the nannies have a certain menu for the children's food every day and every week. The items specified on the menu must not be eaten less by the children. Sometimes, if they can't buy something in the city, they rush to the outskirts to find a way.

Cooking according to the menu is what the nannies think. However, there are just some children who sometimes don't like to eat vegetables or don't like to eat pork. To solve this problem, the nannies put in a lot of effort. For example, if they eat cabbage in the morning, they skip a meal at noon. If they still eat cabbage in the evening, the method of preparation is different. The previous meal involves chopping the cabbage into small pieces and stir-frying it with dried shrimp, and the latter meal involves slicing the cabbage into pieces and braising it with minced meat in chicken soup. In addition, the nannies in the class often draw pictures of foods such as vegetables and radishes to help the children identify them and tell the children what the benefits of eating them are and what the disadvantages of not eating them are. In this way, those children who were originally picky eaters can slowly taste, try, and even eat a lot of the things they don't like to eat. There is a child named Cui Lili, who felt nauseous after eating cabbage since she was a child. After less than a month after entering the station, she was also able to eat it.

The children's health is what the nannies care about most. If a child eats a little less today, the nanny will tell the parents in the evening to pay attention to any changes in him. If a child eats a little more, they will also tell the parents not to give him snacks when he gets home. Recently, a nanny suddenly discovered a child with "chickenpox" at No. 14 Fenzi Hutong. She thought that five children from this courtyard were in the nursery. For the sake of the children's health, they must be isolated. That night, she stood at the door waiting for the parents and didn't let them in. After careful study, the parents felt that leaving the child in the station was the most appropriate thing to do. All the nannies agreed to this request. This is not the first time this has happened. Not long ago, a child stayed in the station for more than three weeks. Thanks to the nannies' meticulous care for the children's health, no child in this nursery has ever contracted an epidemic infectious disease in the past two years.

In the nursery, the nannies get up at six o'clock every morning. In the evening, all the children can only leave the station at seven or eight o'clock. After the children leave, most of the nannies go to study culture, and those on duty stay to disinfect the children's teacups, wash towels, etc. Sometimes, in order to process coarse grains into fine grains, they have to work overnight the night before, busy until late at night.

From January of this year, the station has also established a system of visiting parents in turn on Sundays. Although this system has only been tried for a short time, it has been found to have a good effect on strengthening contact with parents and cooperating with each other to educate children.

A few days before "June 1st," the nannies seemed even busier in order to welcome the children's festival. A week ago, they rushed to make two interesting toys for the children: one is a "zoo"; the other is called "the doll's house." In addition, they also compiled a drama "Little White Rabbit" to perform for the children on the festival.

The nannies are tired enough. What is valuable is that they never complain. Over the years, many difficulties have been overcome in front of them. As parents of the children, on the children's holiday, we sincerely wish them happiness growing up in the new China, and sincerely thank the nannies for their hard work! (Attached pictures)

    我们的祝福和感谢

    这是一个北京式的四合院。院子门口有一块白牌子，上面写着“西单区第四托儿站”。每天早上七点钟光景，这里就开始欢跃起来了。蹬车的杨叔叔把孩子们一批一批地从各处接到托儿站来。阿姨们听见小朋友到站了，就赶快跑出去。小朋友们看见阿姨出来了，就争着说：“阿姨，你早！”阿姨们也忙着回答：“小朋友，你们早！”下车以后，一个个像小燕子似的，一溜烟儿就跑进大门去了。
    初进院子，这里好像是一个普通老百姓的住家。只有走进屋子以后，你才会感到这里具备着许多北京街道托儿站的特点。两间南房，是小班的作息室；比较宽敞的三间北房，是大、中班的作息室。室内悬挂着很多彩色纸球。墙壁四周，粘贴着小朋友们的作业：有颜色纸剪贴的飞机，有蜡笔描绘的苹果等等，红红绿绿，琳琅满目。屋子东边有一个大板床，床上一条条小被子折叠得整整齐齐，这是小朋友午间休息的地方。不久以前，托儿站里又添置了一批崭新的小桌子和小椅子。看起来，这些“家当”很简单，可是，它的来处可真不易啊！
    这已经是1952年秋天的事情了。李玉珍（现任站长）刚从北京市保育训练班学习回来。在街道妇女代表会和群众的帮助下，她决心要办一个托儿站。好容易找到几间房子，群众捐助了一些家常用具：床板，饭锅、饭桌和几副碗筷。接着，就开始招收了几名小朋友。这样，一个托儿站总算勉勉强强成立了。可是，那时正是北京房子最缺的时候，总是不到几个月，有时甚至不到几天，就得搬一回家。有一次，到处找不到房子，眼看托儿站就要停办了。这时候，李玉珍常常想起在保育训练班学习的时候老师们对她说的这样一些话：“搞一项事业，困难总是会有的，干革命工作，不能向困难低头。”想到这些，她的信心又坚强起来了。于是，她又去找区妇联商量。在这里，她得到了积极的支持和鼓舞。当天，区妇联就派了两位同志来帮助她解决房子的问题，在街道上借用了两间房子。可是，这两间房子实在太破旧了。有一次，小朋友们刚离站不久，哗啦一声，外面一间房子的屋顶上，掉下了一根大柱子，正压在孩子们的床上。你看，多么危险啊！从那以后，她们再也不让孩子们在那间房子呆下去了，无论风里雨里，站里至多留下六个孩子，其余的孩子，每天中午由另一个阿姨抱一个背一个地带回家去睡午觉。一直到1954年冬天，由于得到区政府的大力帮助，她们才搬到现在这个地方来安居立业。
    建站的时候，她们只有一个站长、一个阿姨和八个小朋友。现在，托儿站已经增添到六个阿姨和五十个小朋友了。此外，已经登记要求入站的还有五十多人。
    这里的小朋友，常常喜欢唱这只歌曲：“托儿站，是我家，阿姨爱我像妈妈。阿姨给我讲故事，唱歌跳舞笑哈哈。”确是这样。几年以来，托儿站遇到的困难很多。可是，阿姨们总是想出办法，从来不肯让小朋友们感受一点委屈。即使在物质条件最艰难的时候，阿姨们宁愿自己从家里带饭带菜，也要保持每天每个小朋友都能吃到肉、鸡蛋和足够的青菜。
    现在，情况当然更不同了。
    早上八点钟，小朋友们一天愉快欢乐的生活就开始了。
    早操，这是每天最早的一堂课，全站小朋友都要参加。只要阿姨喊一声“小朋友们，早操了！”院子里立时就热闹起来了。到九点半，大班、中班、小班开始分开上课。有的去唱歌，有的去跳舞，有的去做作业。有一个小朋友叫陈燕卿，今年七岁，他很喜欢画画。如果你领他去逛天安门，他回来就给你画一座天安门；你领他上公园，他回来就给你画一些花草树木。有一次，大家出城去玩，刚好有一队骆驼走过，回来以后，他画起骆驼来了。
  一天下午，大班小朋友任世民，在院子里发现有几根长短木块，于是他就选用了其中两根长的和一根短的，把它做成一只单翼的小飞机。但他觉得光这样还不够好。这时候，刚好有一个小班的小朋友走过来，他就向她说：“小妹妹，你借我两根小辫绳，我把它扎起来给你玩好不好？”这个小朋友马上就答应了。没有多久，一架小飞机就按照任世民所想的那样做出来了。
    北京一般街道托儿站对于小朋友费用的分配，多半是伙食费七元，杂费六元，可是这个站始终坚持伙食八元，杂费五元的分配原则。在这里，阿姨们根据妇幼保健所的指导，对于小朋友们的伙食，每天、每个星期都有一定的食谱。食谱上规定了的东西，决不能让孩子们少吃。有时候，城里买不到的东西，她们就赶到城外去想办法。
    根据食谱做饭做菜，这是阿姨们的想法。可是，偏偏就有这么一些小朋友，他们有时候不是不喜欢吃青菜，就是不喜欢吃猪肉。为了解决这个问题，阿姨们花的心思可真不少。譬如，早上吃白菜，中午就隔一顿，如果晚上还是吃白菜，做法就不同了。前一顿把白菜切成末末炒虾米，后一顿就把白菜切成片片用鸡汤烩肉末。另外，班上阿姨经常画一些青菜、萝卜之类的食物图样，帮助小朋友们辨认，告诉小朋友们吃它有什么好处，不吃它有什么坏处。这样，那些原来挑食的小朋友，对于不喜欢吃的东西，也慢慢能够一点点尝着、试着以至于大量地吃了。有一个小朋友叫崔丽梨，从小吃了白菜就恶心，进站以后不到一个月，也就能吃了。
    孩子们的健康，是阿姨们所最关心的。哪一个小朋友今天少吃一点，晚上阿姨就告诉家长回家要注意他有什么变化，哪一个多吃一点，也吩咐家长回家不要再给吃零食。最近，有一个阿姨突然在粉子胡同十四号发现有一个孩子出“水痘”。她想到这个院子有五个孩子在托儿站里。为了孩子们的健康，必须进行隔离。当天晚上，她就站在门口等着家长不让进去。经过仔细研究，家长们觉得把孩子留在站里是最妥当的。对于这个要求，全体阿姨都答应了。这种情况已经不是第一次了。不久以前，有一个小朋友还在站里住了三个多星期呢。由于阿姨们对孩子的健康的无微不至的关心，两年以来，这个托儿站里从来没有一个小朋友得过流行性的传染病。
    在托儿站里，阿姨们每天大清早六点钟就起床了。晚上到七、八点钟，小朋友们才能全部出站。小朋友走了以后，大部分阿姨要去学文化，留下值班的要给孩子们消毒茶碗、洗刷毛巾等等。有时候，为了粗粮细作，头天晚上还得连夜赶工，忙到深夜。
    从今年一月份起，站里又制定了一项星期天轮流访问家长的制度。这个制度虽然才试行不久，但已发现它对加强和家长们的联系，互相配合教育孩子，起了很好的作用。
    “六一”的前几天，为了迎接孩子们的节日，阿姨们显得更加忙碌了。她们在一个星期以前就给孩子们赶制了两件有趣的玩具：一件是“动物园”；一件叫“娃娃的家”。此外，她们还编了一出话剧“小白兔”，在节日为孩子们演出。
    阿姨们是够辛苦的。可贵的是她们从来没有一声怨言。几年以来，很多困难都在她们面前被克服了。作为孩子的家长，在孩子们的节日，我们衷心祝福他们生长在新中国的幸福，衷心感谢阿姨们的辛勤劳动！（附图片）
