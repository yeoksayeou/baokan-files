I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will only make a brief speech on the current situation of water conservancy work this year.

Achievements in Water Conservancy Construction

This year, the people of the whole country have done a lot of work in water conservancy construction. Regarding the planning for the management of major rivers, the Yangtze River Basin plan, with the collaboration of relevant departments such as the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, the Ministry of Geology, and the Ministry of Transport, and with the help of Soviet experts, can put forward a plan outline within the year; under the leadership of the Yellow River Planning Commission, the Yellow River is carrying out the design of the Sanmenxia Reservoir and the basin planning of tributaries; according to the planning scheme studied in the past few years of the Huai River management work, and drawing on the advanced experience of compiling the Yellow River Basin plan, the Huai River will soon complete the compilation of the basin plan for the fundamental cure of water disasters and the comprehensive development of water conservancy. The Hai River Basin plan is being compiled in conjunction with the comprehensive plan for the lower reaches of the Yellow River and can be completed this year. The Liao River basin plan has already begun to be compiled, and the basin plans for the Pearl River, Heilongjiang River, and Songhua River will also begin to be compiled. Regarding water conservancy infrastructure construction, in the first three years, we have completed 63% of the investment in water conservancy infrastructure construction in the First Five-Year Plan. This year, the investment in water conservancy infrastructure construction has increased by 110% compared to the actual completion amount last year, accounting for 59.9% of the total investment in water conservancy infrastructure construction in the First Five-Year Plan. If this year's infrastructure construction plan is completed well, the Five-Year Plan can be completed in four years. The main projects we are carrying out this year are: the Sanmenxia Reservoir project in the Yellow River Basin, which the people of the whole country are looking forward to, is actively preparing, and the State Council has decided to officially start construction in February next year. At the same time, we will continue to strengthen the downstream dikes and temporary flood control measures, and start construction of the Shandong Dayuzhang Yellow River irrigation project, which irrigates 3.24 million mu of farmland; the Yangtze River Basin has completed the main projects of the Han River downstream flood diversion project and the Huayang River flood storage and reclamation project; the Huai River Basin has basically completed the Anhui Meishan Reservoir and the Jiangsu Sheyang Port tide barrier project, and started construction of more than ten reservoir and dam projects such as the Anhui Xianghongdian Reservoir and the Jiangsu Xinyang Port tide barrier, and the tributary management projects of the Sui River, Bei Fei River, Ying River, Fen River, and Wanfu River. The North China water system is building the Nanyun River Sinu Temple Reduction River, the Daqing River Zhaowang New Canal, and the Luan County Baigezhuang Farm irrigation project, and the Tangshan Douhe Reservoir project can be completed before the flood season. The Liao River continues to build the Dafangfang Reservoir on the Hun River tributary, Hubei is building the Zhongxiang Shimen Reservoir, Guangxi is building the Laohuling Reservoir, and Qinghai is building the farm irrigation projects of Delingha, Golmud, and Xiangride. Inner Mongolia is building the flood control projects of Dahei River, Chuoer River, and Xinkai River, and Xinjiang has completed the expansion project of the Mengjin Reservoir and is building the Liugou and Anjihai Reservoirs, all of which can be completed this year.

In this year's infrastructure construction projects, although there has been some progress in many aspects, there are also many problems: because this year's infrastructure construction plan has increased by more than double compared to last year, many newly added projects have not had preliminary designs, so they are included in the annual plan, making the plan lack a reliable technical foundation; design documents cannot be submitted and approved in time, thus affecting the completion of the quarterly infrastructure construction plan; some projects have not strictly followed the infrastructure construction procedures, or have started construction hastily without making preparations, thus causing waste; or due to blind rash advance, designs are compiled hastily, affecting the quality of the design; some projects also have poor on-site construction management, poor quality, and frequent safety accidents. These are all areas we should strive to improve.

Farmland Water Conservancy Progresses Rapidly

Under the situation of the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization across the country, farmland water conservancy work has progressed very rapidly due to the strong leadership of local party and government organizations and the high enthusiasm of farmers across the country for developing production. From October 1955 to the end of May 1956, more than 4.5 million wells have been dug nationwide, more than 490,000 iron waterwheels have been loaned out, more than 27,000 small reservoirs have been built, 93,600 horsepower of pumping machines have been developed, and more than 3.8 million small canals, ponds, dams, and other water conservancy projects have been built. According to reports from various provinces, these projects can increase the irrigation area by more than 159 million mu (including more than 13 million mu of single-season rice converted to double-season rice) and improve the irrigation area by more than 72 million mu. In addition, ditch, furrow, ridge fields, and other drainage projects have been carried out, benefiting an area of more than 74 million mu, and soil and water conservation work has increased the controlled area by more than 54 million mu. Just in terms of the newly added irrigation area, it is equivalent to twice the 87.64 million mu of newly added irrigation area in the six years since liberation. The First Five-Year Plan originally planned to increase the irrigation area by 72 million mu. More than 41 million mu have been completed in the first three years, plus the more than 159 million mu that have now been completed, which is already more than 200 million mu, equivalent to three times the original target of the Five-Year Plan. As of the liberation of the country in 1949, the area of paddy fields and irrigated land created by the Chinese people over thousands of years was about 300 million mu, but in the six years after liberation, we increased the irrigation area by more than 80 million mu, and in the one year after cooperativization, we increased the irrigation area by 159 million mu. This can fully illustrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. This change is gradually changing the natural and agricultural appearance of many regions. For example, 38 counties including Ningyang, Guangrao, Liaocheng, and Licheng in Shandong have 23 districts, 748 townships, and 1,739 cooperatives that have basically turned dry land into irrigated land. Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County in Gansu Province is a famous drought-stricken area. The entire county originally did not have a single mu of irrigated land. This year, it dug 25,843 wells, built 280 canals, and 61 ponds, irrigating 160,000 mu of land, achieving an average of 1.18 mu of irrigated land per person in the county. Henan Province has more than 130 million mu of cultivated land, with more than 13 million mu of existing paddy fields and irrigated land. This past winter and spring, it dug more than 1.1 million wells and also built some ponds, dams, canals, and small reservoir projects. This year, it can increase irrigated land by more than 36 million mu. These specific achievements have made farmers keenly see the glorious prospects of overcoming nature with human power under the conditions of cooperativization, so they happily said: "Repairing reservoirs is like repairing granaries, and storing water is like storing grain," and their enthusiasm is very high.

Regarding the engineering quality of farmland water conservancy, according to surveys, the quality of most projects is good and can achieve the expected benefits. However, because the work is progressing very quickly and technical guidance cannot keep up, the quality of some projects is not good. For example, in the well-digging areas in the north, according to Henan Province's inspection of 140,000 wells in Xuchang Prefecture, most of the wells have sufficient water and can be used with the Liberation-style waterwheel; however, the water volume of more than 10% of the wells is insufficient. Five percent of the wells have crooked shafts and cannot be used. When digging wells, most areas have taken into account the convenience of current use and the needs of future development of mechanized farming and irrigation in terms of well location and well spacing, but there are also individual places where the leadership is not thorough and meticulous, resulting in a bias toward simply pursuing quantity. Wells were dug in places where river water could be used for irrigation, or the well spacing was too dense, resulting in abandonment. In the pond and dam irrigation areas in the south, most projects also meet the standards, and the quality of some projects is not good. Hunan Province inspected 688 newly built small reservoirs in Shaoyang, Xiangtan, Hengyang, and other three prefectures, and about 20% of the projects had some problems. Some have improper calculation of the catchment area or insufficient estimation of rainstorms, so no spillway was opened or the spillway was too small; some have incomplete foundation cleaning, improper compaction, and excessively steep slopes for earthen dams, posing a risk of collapse; some have leaking culverts or lack erosion protection facilities downstream of the culverts and spillways. A few reservoirs also have karst caves in the rocks that cannot store water. Most of these shortcomings can be remedied. Various places are now paying attention to conducting comprehensive inspections and taking measures to improve the quality of projects to fully realize the benefits of the projects. Because many wells have been dug, water lifting tools cannot keep up. In order to solve the difficulty of water lifting tools, some places have convened meetings with blacksmiths, carpenters, farmers, and technicians to transform, trial-produce, and promote old water lifting tools and simple water lifting tools created by farmers. For example, the hand-cranked wooden waterwheel created by Henan farmers has a very low cost, a large water output, and is easy to manufacture and use, and is very popular among farmers. We are introducing and promoting it.

In terms of soil and water conservation, although a lot of work has been done this year and great achievements have been made, due to insufficient publicity of this work, the great significance of soil and water conservation has not been fully accepted by the broad masses. Phenomena such as the opening of wasteland on steep slopes and the removal of grass for fertilizer, which damage soil and water conservation, still occur constantly in some areas, which is worthy of our attention.

In addition, many casualties occurred in this year's farmland water conservancy projects. The reason is that we have not paid enough attention to safe construction and lack necessary systems and technical supervision. Many construction sites have ignored safety in order to catch up with the progress, or have not paid attention to meticulous work, so that the old, young, sick, weak, and pregnant women are put to work, resulting in many casualties or miscarriages. We are now trying to solve this problem in many ways in the hope that there will be significant improvements in a short period of time.

The Water Situation This Year

In May and early June of this year, heavy rains occurred in vast areas of the Yangtze River and Huai River basins, and many rivers rose earlier. Because everyone is concerned about the flood control situation, I will also give a brief report to the representatives on this year's water situation.

Vast areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River south of the Yangtze River experienced heavy rains in May. Jiangxi, northern Hunan, and the Pujiang River in Zhejiang, and the Minjiang River basin in Fujian had 400 to more than 600 millimeters of rainfall, and the Pearl River basin had more than 300 millimeters of rainfall. The Xiang, Zi, and Yuan rivers of the Dongting Lake water system in the Yangtze River Basin, and the Gan, Fu, Xin, Rao, and Xiu rivers of the Poyang Lake water system, have risen sharply several times, thus causing the high water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to be slightly lower than the same period in 1954. The flood at the Gao Yao station of the West River in the Pearl River, and the flood at the Qingyuan and Sanshui stations of the North River have exceeded the guaranteed water level. As of now, no major problems have occurred in these areas except for some mountain flood and waterlogging disasters.

The flood season in the Huai River basin this year was one month earlier than in previous years. From June 2 to 11, heavy rains occurred continuously throughout the basin. The characteristics of this rainstorm were large rainfall, a wide rain area, and continuity for more than ten days. The rainfall in Boshan, Changtaiguan, Fuyang, Bengbu, and other places was more than 370 to 400 millimeters. The total rainfall in July 1954 was 78.8 billion cubic meters, and the rainfall in these ten days was 40.5 billion cubic meters. Therefore, the water levels of the Huai River main stream and the Hong River and Ru River tributaries in the upper reaches rose sharply, and exceeded the highest water level in 1954 in Xixian, Huaibin, Xincai, Bantai, and other places.

Under the attack of this flood, the already built projects in the Huai River played a great role. The Baisha, Banqiao, Shimantan, Nanwan, Boshan, and other reservoirs in the upper reaches all played a role in intercepting and storing floodwater. Among them, the Nanwan Reservoir intercepted 288 million cubic meters of floodwater, and the Boshan Reservoir intercepted 148 million cubic meters of floodwater. Flood storage projects in various depressions, such as Laowangpo, Jiaoting Lake, Wu Song Lake, Dongda Lake, Li Da Lake, and Nei Shui River in Henan, have all intercepted and stored floodwater. Huaibin County (the County People's Committee is in Wulongji) in Henan Province, because of its low terrain, the dikes can only defend against smaller floods, and a breach occurred on June 8. The lake and depression flood storage projects above Huainan City in Anhui Province, such as the Menghe Depression, Chengdong Lake, and Zhengyangguan South Depression, have also successively stored or diverted floodwater. The above reservoirs and flood storage and diversion areas have intercepted and stored a total of 5.2 billion cubic meters of floodwater. The Runheji into Lake Gate was not opened, and Chenxi Lake, Shouxih Lake, and Wabuhu were not used for flood storage. After these measures, the flood was safely discharged. No breaches occurred in the main dikes of the main and tributary streams. However, because the rainstorm came early, fell rapidly, and lasted for more than ten days, a large area of Anhui and Henan suffered from rain and waterlogging disasters. In particular, because the wheat was not yet ripe, large areas of wheat fields were damaged under the conditions of rainstorms and internal waterlogging. In previous years, most flood storage and diversion areas could obtain a wheat harvest. This year, although the masses were mobilized to rush to harvest before flood storage and diversion, due to the urgency of time, only about 10% of the wheat was harvested in the flood storage area in Henan, and more was harvested in Anhui.

Since June 12, the weather in the Huai River basin has improved, and the water level of the Huai River has gradually receded. Now, the broad masses in the Huai River basin are continuing to repair dangerous sections of dikes, strengthen flood control and drainage, and rush to harvest under the leadership of the local party and government organizations. At the same time, they are carrying out replanting work after the rain to strive to complete this year's production plan. However, completely eradicating water and drought disasters is a long-term and arduous struggle; the fundamental cure and development of various rivers, some have not yet begun, some are only preparing to proceed, and some will take a long time to complete. This year's flood season has just begun, and the threat of floods has not been completely eliminated. The weather conditions this year are also worthy of our special attention. We are now vigilantly carrying out various preparations to overcome the possible occurrence of extraordinarily large floods this year in order to strive for the victory of this struggle.

The representatives are very concerned about water conservancy work, and many representatives have a lot of research on water conservancy work. In the water conservancy construction in recent years, we have received many valuable suggestions and enthusiastic support from all aspects, which has greatly helped to improve our work. At this meeting, I hope everyone will give us more criticisms and suggestions so that we can correct our shortcomings and mistakes under everyone's supervision and do a good job in water conservancy.

    修库如修仓，积水如积粮
    ——水利部长傅作义的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程
  的说明，和彭真副委员长关于人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，现在我只就今年水利工作的情况，做一个简短的发言。
    水利建设的成就
    今年全国人民在水利建设方面做了很多工作。关于大江大河的治理规划方面，长江流域规划在水利部、电力工业部、地质部、交通部等有关部门协作和苏联专家帮助下，年内可以提出一个规划要点；黄河在黄河规划委员会领导下，正在进行三门峡水库设计和支流的流域规划；淮河根据几年来治淮工作中研究的规划方案，并且吸取了编制黄河流域规划的先进经验，即将完成淮河的根治水害和综合开发水利的流域规划的编制工作。海河流域规划，结合黄河下游综合规划进行编制，今年可以完成。辽河的流域规划已经开始编制，珠江、黑龙江、松花江的流域规划，也就要开始编制。关于水利基本建设方面，前三年我们已经完成了第一个五年计划水利基本建设投资额的63％，今年水利基本建设的投资额比去年的实际完成额增长110％，占第一个五年计划水利基本建设总投资额的59.9％。如果今年的基本建设计划完成得好，四年就可以完成五年计划。今年我们所进行的主要的工程是：全国人民期待的黄河流域三门峡水库工程，正在积极进行准备，国务院决定于明年2月正式开工。同时，继续加强下游堤防和临时防洪措施，并且开始修建灌溉农田324万亩的山东打渔张引黄灌溉工程；长江流域已经完成了汉江下游分洪工程和华阳河蓄洪垦殖的主要工程；淮河流域基本上完成了安徽梅山水库和江苏射阳港挡潮闸工程，开始修筑安徽响洪甸水库、江苏新洋港挡潮闸等十余处水库闸坝工程和濉河、北肥河、颍河、汾河、万福河等支流治理工程。华北水系正在兴修南运河四女寺减河、大清河赵王新渠和滦县柏各庄农场灌溉工程，唐山陡河水库工程汛前即可完成。辽河继续兴修支流浑河大伙房水库，湖北正在修筑钟祥石门水库，广西修筑老虎岭水库，青海修筑德令喀、格尔木、香日德等农场灌溉工程。内蒙修筑大黑河、绰儿河、新开河等防洪工程，新疆完成猛进水库扩建工程，正在修建柳沟和安集海水库，今年均可完成。
    在今年的基本建设工程中，虽然许多方面有些进步，但是也存在很多问题：由于今年基本建设计划比较去年增大一倍以上，很多新增加的工程没有初步设计，就列入了年度计划，使计划缺乏可靠的技术基础；设计文件不能及时提出和审批，因而影响了季度基本建设计划的完成；有的工程没有严格遵守基本建设程序，或者没有作好准备即仓促开工，因而造成浪费；或者由于盲目冒进情绪，仓促赶编设计，影响设计质量；也有些工程施工现场管理不好，质量作的较差，安全事故不断发生。这些都是我们应该努力改进的地方。
  农田水利进展十分迅速
    农田水利工作在全国农业合作化高潮的形势下，由于各地党政强有力的领导，和全国农民发展生产的高度热情，进展十分迅速。从1955年10月到1956年5月底，全国已打水井450多万眼，出贷铁制水车49万多部，修筑小型水库27，000多座，发展抽水机93，600匹马力，修筑小型渠道、塘坝和其他水利工程380多万处。据各省报告，这些工程共可增加灌溉面积15，900多万亩（其中包括一季稻改双季稻1，300多万亩），改善灌溉面积7，200多万亩。另外还做了沟洫畦田和其他除涝工程，受益面积7，400多万亩，水土保持工作增加控制面积5，400多万亩。单就新增灌溉面积来说，就相当解放六年来新增灌溉面积的8，764万亩的两倍。第一个五年计划原定增加灌溉面积7，200万亩，前三年已经完成4，100多万亩，加上现在已经完成的15，900多万亩，就已经完成两亿多亩，相当五年计划原定指标的三倍。截至1949年全国解放的时候，我国人民几千年来所创造的水田和水浇地面积约为三亿多万亩，可是解放后六年的时间，我们就增加灌溉面积8，000多万亩，合作化后一年的时间，我们就增加灌溉面积15，900万亩，这可以充分说明社会主义制度的无比的优越性。这个变化正在逐步改变许多地区的自然的面貌和农业的面貌，例如山东宁阳、广饶、聊城、历城等38个县，有23个区，748个乡，1，739个社已经基本上把旱地变为水浇地。甘肃省张家川回族自治县是有名的干旱的地方，全县原来没有一亩水浇地，今年打井25，843眼，修渠280条，塘61个，浇地16万亩，做到全县平均每人1.18亩水浇地。河南省耕地13，000多万亩，原有水田及水浇地1，300多万亩，去冬今春共打110多万眼，还修了一些塘坝渠道和小水库工程，今年就可以增加水浇地3，600多万亩。这些具体成就使农民亲切地看到了在合作化的条件下，用人力战胜自然的光辉前景，所以他们高兴地说：“修库如修仓，积水如积粮”，情绪十分高涨。
    关于农田水利的工程质量，据调查，多数工程质量是好的，能够发挥预期的效益，但是，因为工作进行得很快，技术指导配合不上，也有一部分工程质量不好。比如在北方打井地区，据河南省检查许昌专区14万眼井中，大多数水量充足，用解放式水车汲水，可以够用；但是也有百分之十几的井水量不够。有5％的井，井筒歪偏不能使用。在打井的时候，多数地区都在井位和井距上照顾了目前使用的方便和将来发展机耕机灌的需要，但是也有个别的地方，领导不深入不细致，以致发生单纯追逐数量的偏向，在可以引河水浇灌的地里打了井，或者井距过密，形成废弃。在南方塘坝灌溉地区，也是大多数工程合乎标准，有一部分工程质量不好。湖南省检查了邵阳、湘潭、衡阳等三个专区新建的小水库688座，其中有20％左右的工程存有一些问题。有的是集雨面积计算不当或者对暴雨估计不足，因而未开溢洪道或者溢洪道开得太小；有的是土坝清基不彻底、夯打不实，边坡过陡，有倒塌的危险；有的是涵管漏水或者是涵管和溢洪道下游缺乏防冲的设施。也有少数库内岩石有溶洞不能蓄水。这些缺点，多数还可补救。现在各地已经注意进行全面检查，并且采取措施改善工程质量，以充分发挥工程效益。因为井打得多了，提水工具也跟不上。为了解决提水工具的困难，有些地方召开有铁匠、木匠、农民和技术人员参加的会议，改造试制和推广旧有的提水工具和农民创造的简易提水工具。如河南农民创造的手摇式木制水车，成本很低，出水量很大，便于制造和使用，很受农民欢迎。我们正在介绍推广。
    在水土保持方面，今年虽然作了许多工作，收到很大成绩，但是由于我们对这一工作宣传不够，水土保持的重大意义还未被广大群众完全接受，有些地区群众在陡坡开荒、铲草积肥等破坏水土保持的现象，仍然不断发生，这是值得我们注意的。
      另外，在今年的农田水利工程中，发生了很多伤亡事故。原因是我们对安全施工重视不够，缺乏必要的制度和技术监督，许多工地为赶进度，便忽视安全，或不注意精工，使老幼病弱和孕妇上工，结果造成许多伤亡或流产事故，现在我们正在多方面设法解决这一问题，以期在短时间内能有显著改进。
                       今年的水情
      今年5月和6月上旬，长江和淮河流域的广大地区出现暴雨，许多江河涨水较早。因为大家关心防汛的情况，我也把今年的水情向各位代表作个简单的报告。
      长江以南中下游广大地区，5月份出现暴雨。江西、湖南北部和浙江浦阳江，福建闽江流域都有400公厘至600多公厘的降雨，珠江流域有300公厘以上的降雨。长江流域洞庭湖水系的湘、资、沅诸水，鄱阳湖水系的赣、抚、信、饶、修诸水，都曾数度猛涨，因而造成长江中下游略低于1954年同期水位的高水位。珠江的西江高要站，北江清远和三水站洪水都曾超过保证水位。截至目前，这些地区除曾发生部分山洪渍涝灾害以外，都没有发生重大问题。
    淮河流域今年汛期比往年提早一个月，从6月2日到11日，全流域连续发生暴雨。这次暴雨的特点是雨量大，雨区广，并且连续十几天。薄山、长台关、阜阳、蚌埠等地雨量都在370至400公厘以上。1954年7月一个月的降雨总量为788亿公方，这次十天的降雨量就有405亿公方。因此，上游淮河干流和支流洪河汝河的水位，都急遽上涨，并且在息县、淮滨、新蔡、班台等地超过1954年最高水位。
    在这次洪水的袭击下，淮河已修的工程发挥了很大的作用。上游白沙、板桥、石漫滩、南湾、薄山等水库都起了拦蓄洪水的作用。其中南湾水库拦洪2.88亿公方，薄山水库拦洪1.48亿公方。各洼地蓄洪工程如河南境内的老王坡、蛟停湖、吴宋湖、东大湖、李大湖、内水河等都已拦蓄洪水。河南淮滨县（县人民委员会在乌龙集）因为地势低洼，堤防只能防御较小洪水，曾经在6月8日发生漫决。安徽境内淮南市以上的湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，如蒙河洼地、城东湖、正阳关南洼地等蓄洪和行洪地区，也都先后蓄洪或行洪。以上水库和蓄洪行洪区共拦蓄洪水52亿公方。润河集进湖闸未开，城西湖、寿西湖及瓦埠湖等未曾蓄洪。经过这些措施，洪水就安全下泄。干支流主要堤防没有发生溃决。但是，因为这次暴雨来得早，下得急，并且连续十几天，安徽河南有很大地区发生了雨涝灾害，特别是因为小麦还未成熟，在暴雨和内涝情况下，大片麦田受了损失。各蓄洪行洪区前几年多可获得麦收，今年在蓄洪行洪以前虽然也曾动员群众进行抢收，但是由于时间仓促，河南的蓄洪区只抢收小麦10％左右，安徽抢收较多。
    自6月12日起淮河流域天气已经好转，淮河水位已经逐步回落。现在淮河流域的广大群众，正在当地党政的领导下，继续整修堤防险段，加强防汛和排涝抢收，同时进行雨后补种工作，为完成今年的生产计划而努力。但是彻底根除水旱灾害，是一个长期的艰苦斗争；各个江河的根治和开发，有的还没有开始，有的才准备进行，有的则还需要很长时间才能完成，今年汛期又是刚刚开始，洪水的威胁还没有完全解除，今年的天气情况也值得我们特别注意，现在我们正在警惕地为战胜今年可能发生的特大洪水而进行各种准备工作，以争取这一斗争的胜利。
    各位代表对水利工作是十分关心的，并且有许多代表对水利工作很有研究。在几年来的水利建设中，我们就曾得到很多的宝贵建议和各方面的热情支持，对改进我们的工作帮助很大。在这次会议上，我希望大家给我们提出更多的批评和指教，以便在大家的监督下，改正我们的缺点和错误，把水利工作作好。
