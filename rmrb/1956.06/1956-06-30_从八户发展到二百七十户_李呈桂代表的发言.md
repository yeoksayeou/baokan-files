From Eight Households to Two Hundred and Seventy Households
-- Speech by Delegate Li Chenggui

    I completely agree with and support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the budget and final accounts, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report of the Standing Committee.
    Developing and consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives, and doing a good job in agricultural production, is of extreme importance for increasing national income, improving the people's livelihood, and ensuring the smooth implementation of the 1956 national budget. I am directly involved in agricultural production and would like to express some opinions in this regard:
    From the second session to the third session of the First National People's Congress, in less than a year, the face of our country's countryside has undergone fundamental changes. Since October last year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all regions have overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and a nationwide upsurge in agricultural cooperation has emerged. Especially after the publication of the National Agricultural Development Program this year, farmers have more confidence in the prospects of socialism, their enthusiasm for production has increased even more, and their drive to engage in socialism is even greater. Take our Liling Sanbu Cooperative as an example. Last spring, it was still a newly established primary cooperative with only 8 households. Because of the increased income after the autumn harvest, which demonstrated the benefits of cooperation, it was transformed into an advanced cooperative with 270 households in the winter. Currently, more than 90% of the farmers in Liling County have joined primary agricultural producers' cooperatives, basically realizing semi-socialist cooperation. At present, the masses are actively preparing to organize advanced cooperatives, and this autumn it will definitely be possible to complete the fully socialist form of agricultural cooperation.
    The high tide of agricultural cooperation has brought about a high tide of agricultural production. Taking our Sanbu Advanced Cooperative as an example, over the past year, more than 3,000 workdays have been spent on water conservancy construction, more than twice as much as in previous years. Many ponds and canals that had not been repaired for 40 to 100 years have also been repaired. Of the cooperative's 1,200+ mu of double-cropping rice fields, almost all can be ensured against drought, except for about 10 mu of high-ridge fields. Manure accumulation is also more than in the past. In 1955, there were only 150 dan per mu, but this year it averages 300 dan per mu, an increase of one time. Coupled with the promotion of improved varieties, the improvement of cultivation techniques, and the development of diversified operations in agricultural and sideline industries, it is entirely certain that this year's output will increase. As long as the distribution is reasonable in the future, it can be guaranteed that 90% of the members will increase their income.

    从八户发展到二百七十户
    ——李呈桂代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理关于预决算的报告、廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明和彭真副委员长所作的常务委员会的工作报告。
    发展和巩固农业生产合作社，搞好农业生产，对于增加国家收入、改善群众生活，保证1956年国家预算的顺利执行，有极重要的意义。我是直接参加农业生产的，想在这方面发表一点意见：
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议到第三次会议，时间不到一年，我国的农村面貌已经起了根本的变化。从去年10月开始，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，各地都克服了右倾保守思想，出现了全国性的农业合作化的高潮，特别是今年公布了农业发展纲要后，农民对社会主义的远景更有信心，生产积极性更加高涨，搞社会主义的劲头更大。就拿我们醴陵三步合作社来讲，去年春天还是个初办的只有8户的初级社，由于秋后增加了收入，显示了合作化的好处，冬天就转成了270户的高级社。现在醴陵全县已有90％以上的农户参加了初级农业生产合作社，基本上实现了半社会主义的合作化。目前群众正在积极准备组织高级社，今年秋后一定可以完成全社会主义形式的农业合作化。
    农业合作化的高潮，带来了农业生产的高潮。拿我们三步高级社为例，在修水利方面，去年来共花3，000多个劳动日，超过了前几年的两倍。许多40年到100年未曾修整好的塘和水渠也修整好了。全社1，200多亩双季稻田，除10来亩高坎田外，几乎可以全部确保不受旱灾。积肥也比过去多，1955年每亩田只有150担，今年则平均每亩可达300担，增加了一倍，加上良种的推广，耕作技术的改良和开展农副业的多种经营，今年产量的增加是完全有把握的。只要将来分配合理，90％的社员增加收入，是可以保证的。
