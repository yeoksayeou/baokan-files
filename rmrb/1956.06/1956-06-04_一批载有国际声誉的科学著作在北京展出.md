    A Batch of Internationally Renowned Scientific Works Exhibited in Beijing
    The Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society began exhibiting a large number of scientific works by its members in Beijing on the 3rd.
    The exhibition of some works with international reputation has become a feature of this exhibition. Gu脊椎 [vertebrate] paleontologist Yang Zhongjian, geologist Huang Jiqing, paleontologist Sun Yunzhu and others have each produced more than one hundred scientific works, and only a small part of them are exhibited here. Yang Zhongjian has made outstanding achievements in the study of mammalian animals and Cenozoic geology, and his works in these areas are highly regarded by his foreign colleagues. Huang Jiqing's "Study of the Permian System in Southern China," published in 1932, attracted the attention of geological circles in the Soviet Union, the United States, Italy and other countries at that time; his book "Major Geological Tectonic Units of China" has been praised by some European geological journals and geologists in Japan and other countries. Sun Yunzhu is an expert in the study of "Trilobites," invertebrates from 400 million years ago, and he was the first Chinese person to write a paper on ancient invertebrates.
    The exhibits also include the works of famous physicist Zhou Peiyuan, meteorologist Tu Changwang, Li Jinxi, who has studied modern Chinese grammar for decades, and You Guoen, a researcher of classical Chinese literature.
    The exhibition displays a total of 1,465 works, accounting for about half of the works of the members of the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society. The content includes geology, paleontology, biology, medicine and health, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, physics, chemistry, mathematics, technical science, politics and law, economics, history and geography, education, philosophy, language and writing, literature, art and many other aspects, most of which are works after liberation.
    The exhibition is scheduled to last for two weeks.

    一批载有国际声誉的科学著作在北京展出
    九三学社北京市分社，三日开始在北京展出社员的大批科学著作。
    一些载有国际声誉的著作的展出，成为这个展览会的特色。古脊椎动物学家杨钟健、地质学家黄汲清、古生物学家孙云铸等人的科学论著都在一百件以上，这里展出了其中一小部分。杨钟健对哺乳类动物和新生代地质的研究有突出的成就，他在这些方面的著作为他的国外同行们所推重。黄汲清在1932年出版的“中国南部二叠纪的研究”，引起了当时苏、美、意等国地质界的重视；他的“中国主要地质构造单位”一书曾经得到欧洲的一些地质学杂志和日本等国的地质学家的好评。孙云铸是研究四万万年以前的无脊椎动物“三叶虫”的专家，他是中国第一个写出古代无脊椎动物论文的人。
    展览品中还有著名物理学家周培源、气象学家涂长望、研究现代汉语语法已有数十年功夫的黎锦熙、中国古典文学研究者游国恩等人的著作。
    展览会一共展出著作一千四百六十五件，约占九三学社北京市分社社员著作中的一半。内容包括地质学、古生物学、生物学、医药卫生、农林水利、物理、化学、数学、技术科学、政法、经济、史地、教育、哲学、语言文字、文学、美术等许多方面，大部分是解放后的著作。
    这个展览会预定举行两星期。
