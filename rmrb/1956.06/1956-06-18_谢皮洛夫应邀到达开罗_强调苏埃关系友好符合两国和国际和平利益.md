Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 17th: According to TASS, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov arrived in Cairo on June 16th at the invitation of the Egyptian government, and he will participate in the celebrations for the Republic Day of Egypt in Cairo.

Shepilov made a statement upon arrival. On behalf of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, he extended his sincerest respects to the hardworking and heroic Egyptian people. He said that as early as February, the Egyptian government had extended a friendly invitation for him to visit Egypt during the Republic Day. He accepted this invitation with deep gratitude and excitement, because as the Egyptian proverb says, whoever has drunk the water of the Nile once will not want to come to this blessed country again.

Shepilov said that the Soviet Union fundamentally rejects any policy of colonial expansion. Its economic structure does not include oil monopolies or imperialist monopolies that exploit the wealth of less developed countries. The Soviet Union's relations with all countries, large and small, are based on the principles of complete equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. The Soviet people regard the people of Arab countries as close brothers.

He said that the Soviet government is deeply convinced that the further consolidation and development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Egypt are in the interests of both countries and in the interests of international peace and security. The Soviet people are sincerely pleased with the great achievements made by the friendly Egyptian people and their government in consolidating the independence and sovereignty of the Egyptian state. These achievements once again demonstrate that the cause of peace and human progress is bound to triumph.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Fawzi (representing the Egyptian Prime Minister) and other Egyptian government officials, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Egypt, were at the Cairo airport to welcome Shepilov.

    谢皮洛夫应邀到达开罗
    强调苏埃关系友好符合两国和国际和平利益
    新华社17日电　据塔斯社开罗讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫应埃及政府的邀请在六月十六日到达开罗，他将在开罗参加埃及共和国日的庆祝活动。
    谢皮洛夫在到达后发表了谈话。他代表苏联政府和苏联人民向勤劳英勇的埃及人民致最诚挚的敬意。他说，早在二月间埃及政府就友好地邀请他在埃及共和国日来埃及访问。他以深切感谢和激动的心情接受了这一邀请，因为正如埃及的俗语所说的，谁喝过一次尼罗河的水，谁就不会不想再度来到这个幸福的国家。
    谢皮洛夫说，苏联根本上否定任何殖民扩张政策，它在它的经济结构中没有石油垄断资本和榨取不大发达国家的膏脂的帝国主义垄断资本，苏联同一切大小国家相处中以完全平等、互相尊重自主和不干涉内政的原则为基础。苏联人民把阿拉伯国家的人民看作是亲兄弟。
    他说，苏联政府深信，苏联和埃及两国之间的友好关系的进一步巩固和发展是符合我们两国的利益的，也是符合国际和平和安全的利益的。苏联人们为友好的埃及人民和他们的政府在巩固埃及国家的独立和主权方面所取得的巨大成就而感到衷心的高兴。这种成就又一次表明和平和人类进步的事业是必定胜利的。
    到开罗机场欢迎谢皮洛夫的有埃及外交部长马茂德·法齐（代表埃及总理）和埃及政府其他官员，以及各国驻埃及的外交使节。
