    Intern Creates New Grouting Method for Tunnel Waterproofing Layers
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    Since the proposal to complete the Baoji-Chengdu Railway ahead of schedule, the workers of the First Engineering Section of the Sixth Engineering Bureau have been working intensely. No one wants their work to hinder the opening of the railway, and everyone is actively trying to find ways to speed up the project. However, the workers responsible for grouting the tunnel waterproofing layers couldn't think of a way to improve the efficiency of the waterproofing layer grouting, and repeatedly asked the leadership to help improve the operation methods.
    After understanding this situation, the section leaders decided to send intern Li Xian to help them.
    Li Xian graduated from Tangshan Railway Institute in 1954. Shortly after graduation, he was assigned to the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway for an internship. He is a young man interested in all engineering projects. In the past two years, he has liked to understand everything about the projects he has personally participated in or visited, from design to construction, even the details of a project. If he doesn't understand, he finds reference books to study and learns from workers and veteran technicians. Sometimes, to understand a problem, he even climbs mountains and ridges to conduct practical investigations.
    After accepting the new task, he decided to go to Tunnels No. 23 and No. 24, which were being grouted, to understand the situation and prepare to solve the problem of grouting efficiency starting from these two tunnels.
    He walked into Tunnel No. 23 and was shocked by the situation of the workers grouting the waterproofing layer. Grout was spraying out of the various holes on the arch and walls of the tunnel (these are holes left for grouting, one row every four meters, with eight or nine holes in each row) like a spring. Grout was everywhere in the tunnel, and the workers were covered in grout. Some workers' eyes were red from the grout, and some workers' hands were burned. The grout flowed out along the ditches in the tunnel.
    Seeing this situation, Li Xian thought about how much cement was being wasted! He should first find a way to solve this problem. He found several veteran workers and learned about the current situation of waterproofing layer grouting from them.
    They were using the "skip-eye grouting method," that is, pointing the grout pipe at one hole and continuously grouting until grout flowed out of each hole. In this way, at least 22.5 bags of cement were used per meter, and sometimes even 40 to 50 bags.
    Li Xian came out of the tunnel and climbed to the top of the mountain above the tunnel. He found that grout was also flowing out along the mountain crevices above the tunnel exit. If there was grout in the mountain crevices, it meant that a lot of grout was being lost.
    He ran from Tunnel No. 23 to Tunnel No. 24 and found that the situation there was the same. He thought, who stipulated that 22.5 bags of cement must be used per meter? The main purpose of grouting the waterproofing layer is to waterproof, and the second is to fill the voids. Can't this purpose be achieved by grouting less? He decided to study a way to save cement.
    He told his wife, Jia Zhiqiu (an intern), about his idea. She agreed with him and helped him find relevant reference materials. They calculated an account for Tunnel No. 24. On average, Tunnel No. 24 only needed grout made of 325 kilograms of cement and more than 960 kilograms of sand per meter, but now they were grouting with grout made of 1,125 kilograms of cement and 3,375 kilograms of sand. How could the grout not flow out if it exceeded the void volume?
    After Li Xian calculated the results, he thought of the shortcomings of the old grouting method and proposed the "sequential grouting with temporary flow" method, grouting from the downhill to the uphill, and switching to the next hole after grout came out of the previous hole. This would save cement and sand, improve workers' working conditions, and improve work efficiency.
    He told the workers of Tunnel No. 23 about this method, and the workers thought it was very good. In the past, changing holes required stopping the machine, and each stop took a long time. After discussing with the workers, it was decided to change holes without stopping the machine, and to change holes when the grout in the cylinder ran out.
    Then, he told Wu Shiyun, the director of the construction office of the section, about this method. Wu Shiyun agreed with the method and said, "If this method is successful, it can solve the problem."
    However, many people opposed this method during the construction office meeting. Engineer Zhang Guangxiong said, "The main purpose of grouting is to fill the voids, connect the mountain and the arch with grout, and strengthen the tunnel. The second is waterproofing. Li Xian's method does not fill the voids."
    A technician surnamed Liu also agreed with Engineer Zhang's opinion.
    Li Xian disagreed with this statement. He said, "The already excavated natural arch will not collapse just because there is a void, because the formation of the natural arch has been considered according to the pressure of the stratum during design, and the pressure of the natural arch has also been considered when designing the 'lining'. Therefore, it cannot be said that it is easy to cause collapse just because there is a small void. According to Technician Liu's statement, even mountain crevices must be filled with grout."
    Technician Liu did think that even mountain crevices should be grouted.
    Obviously, this statement is incorrect. The Qinling Mountains are so large, and some mountain crevices are connected. How much grout would it take to fill them all?
    Wu Shiyun and many technicians agreed with Li Xian's opinion.
    Zhang Guangxiong, however, quoted the opinions of Soviet experts and Soviet technical books out of context to defend himself. But he was corrected on the spot.
    After discussion, the leaders of the First Engineering Section approved Li Xian's new method and started grouting with the new method in several tunnels at the same time. As a result of the workers using the new method, an average of only 425 kilograms of cement and 1,275 kilograms of sand were used per meter, saving 700 kilograms of cement and more than 2,100 kilograms of sand compared to the old method. The First Engineering Section saved 350,000 kilograms of cement and more than 1 million kilograms of sand by grouting 500 meters of tunnel with the new method. According to the grouting situation of each tunnel, 25 meters can be grouted per shift (eight hours), and the efficiency is five times higher than before.

    创造隧道防水层新浇灌法的实习生 
    本报记者　朱波
    自从提出提前完成宝成铁路通车任务之后，第六工程局第一工段的职工们，都紧张起来了。谁都不愿意因自己的工作不好而妨碍通车，都在积极地想办法加速工程进度。但是，负责浇灌隧道防水层的工人们，总想不出提高浇灌防水层效率的办法，一再要求领导上帮助改进操作方法。
    工段领导人了解这种情况之后，就决定派实习生李显去帮助他们。
    李显是1954年从唐山铁道学院毕业的，毕业后不久就被分配到宝成路北段实习。他是一个对所有工程都感兴趣的青年。两年来，他对亲自参加的工程，或参观过的工程，从设计到施工，那怕是一个工程上的细节，都喜欢弄清楚。不懂，自己就找参考书进行研究，并且向工人，向老技术人员学习。有时候，为了弄清楚一个问题还爬山越岭，进行实际调查。
    他接受了新任务，就决定到正在浇灌的二十三号和二十四号隧道去了解情况，准备从两个隧道着手解决灌浆效率问题。
    他走进二十三号隧道一看，工人浇灌防水层的情况使他大吃一惊。隧道拱顶和拱墙上的各个眼里（这是为灌浆留下的眼，每四公尺一排，每排八、九个），灰浆像泉水一样向外喷射，隧道里到处是灰浆，工人浑身都是灰浆，有的工人眼睛被灰浆烧红了，有的工人双手被灰浆烧烂了。灰浆顺着隧道里的水沟一直向外流去。
    李显看到这种情况后，就想到这样要浪费多少水泥呀！应该首先想办法解决这个问题。他找到了几个老工人，从老工人那里了解目前浇灌防水层的情况。
    他们采用的是“跳眼灌浆法”，即把灰浆管子对准一个眼一直灌下去，等到每个眼里都流出灰浆为止。这样每公尺最少要浇灌二十二袋半以上的水泥，有的甚至浇灌四、五十袋水泥。
    李显从隧道里出来，又爬到隧道上的山头上去看，发现在隧道出口上边的山缝里，灰浆也顺着山缝一直流出去。山缝里也有灰浆，那就说明流失的灰浆一定很多。
    他从二十三号隧道跑到二十四号隧道，发现那里的情况也是一样。他想这是谁规定一定要每公尺灌二十二袋半水泥呢？浇灌防水层主要为的是防水，其次才是填充空隙，少灌些不是也能达到这个目的吗？他决定研究出一个节省水泥的办法来。
    他把自己的想法告诉他的爱人贾稚秋（实习生）。她同意他的看法，帮助他找有关的参考资料。他们给二十四号隧道算了一笔账，二十四号隧道平均每公尺只要用325公斤水泥和960多公斤沙子拌成的灰浆就够了，而现在却浇灌了1，125公斤水泥和3，375公斤沙子搅拌成的灰浆。灰浆超过空隙容积，怎样不向外流呢？
    李显计算出结果以后，联想到旧的浇灌方法的缺点，拟出了“逐眼灌注临时流浆”办法，从下坡向上坡灌，每灌到上一个眼冒浆，就换上一个眼再灌。这样既节省水泥和沙子，又可以改善工人的劳动条件，还可以提高工作效率。
    他把这个办法告诉二十三号隧道的工人，工人们认为很好。过去换眼要停机器，每停一次机器需要很长时间。经过和工人们研究后，决定换眼不停机器，等到缸里的灰浆没了的时候换眼。
    接着，他就把这个办法告诉工段施工室主任吴士允。吴士允同意这个办法，说：“这个办法要是成功了，可以解决问题。”
    但是，施工室会议讨论这个办法的时候，很多人都反对。张广熊工程师说：“灌灰浆为的主要是填充空隙，用灰浆把山和拱连接起来，加固隧道。其次是防水。李显的办法就没有起到填充空隙的作用。”
    一个姓刘的技术员也同意张工程师的意见。
    李显不同意这种说法。他说：“已经挖好的自然拱不会因为有一个空隙就会塌方，因为设计的时候，已经根据地层的压力考虑自然拱的形成，而且在设计‘衬砌’的时候也考虑到自然拱的压力，因此，不能说因为有一个小空隙就容易造成塌方，按照刘技术员的说法，山缝也要灌满灰浆。”
    刘技术员的确认为连山缝也要灌浆。
    很显然这种说法是不对的，秦岭这样大，有些山缝是相连着的，要用多少灰浆才能灌满呢。
    吴士允和很多技术人员都同意李显的意见。
    张广熊却断章取义地用苏联专家的意见和苏联技术书籍来为自己辩护。但是，当场就被别人纠正了。
    经过讨论后，第一工段领导上批准了李显的新办法，并且同时在几个隧道开始用新方法灌浆。工人们用新方法灌浆的结果，平均每公尺只用了425公斤水泥和1，275公斤沙子。比用旧办法节省七百公斤水泥和二千一百多公斤沙子。一工段用新法灌五百公尺隧道，共节省水泥三十五万公斤，沙子一百多万公斤。根据各隧道浇灌的情况来看，每班（八小时）可以浇灌二十五公尺，效率比过去提高五倍。
