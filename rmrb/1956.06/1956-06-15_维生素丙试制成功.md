    Vitamin C Successfully Trial-produced
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang) The Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory recently trial-produced 40 kilograms of Vitamin C, which China could not produce in the past. It is a medicine that specifically treats scurvy and can promote human metabolism.
    After content analysis, this new product's quality has been proven to have reached international standards. To prepare for mass production, the workers accepted the Soviet expert's suggestion to change the past alcohol crystallization method to water crystallization in the production process of the key raw material - glucose, reducing the cost of glucose by two-thirds. Using water instead of alcohol for crystallization can also ensure production safety.

    维生素丙试制成功
    本报沈阳讯　东北制药总厂最近试制出四十公斤我国过去不能生产的维生素丙。它是一种专治坏血病，能促进人体新陈代谢的药品。
    这种新产品经过进行含量分析，证明质量已经达到国际标准。为了给大批生产作好准备，职工们接受苏联专家的建议，在重要原料——葡萄糖的生产过程中将过去的酒结晶办法改为用水进行结晶，使葡萄糖的成本降低三分之二。用水代替酒来结晶，还可以保证生产安全。
