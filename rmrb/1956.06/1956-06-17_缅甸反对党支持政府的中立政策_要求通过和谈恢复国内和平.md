Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 16th: The first session of the Burmese Chamber of Deputies concluded on June 14th. The June 14th meeting focused on Prime Minister U Ba Swe's policy address.

    U Tun Pe Myint, one of the opposition leaders, expressed support for the government's independent and neutral foreign policy. He said that a peaceful and neutral foreign policy has the nature of opposing colonialism and opposing military blocs. He hoped that the new government would show greater determination to oppose military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    When discussing domestic issues, U Tun Pe Myint said that Burma's civil war was the result of differing political views. He believed that the civil war could be resolved through a policy of peaceful negotiation. He emphasized that the Burmese people urgently demanded the restoration of domestic peace, and the domestic situation had recently undergone great changes. Moreover, some leaders of the underground forces were colleagues of the current cabinet ministers in the common struggle against British colonialism and Japanese militarists. U Tun Pe Myint called on the government to abandon its policy of fighting to the end and adopt a policy of negotiation.

    In response, Prime Minister U Ba Swe said that the new cabinet would resolutely implement an independent and neutral foreign policy, and would first consider the interests of the Union of Burma when implementing the policy. Regarding the issue of domestic peace, U Ba Swe said that the government had "always strived" to negotiate with the Communist Party leaders in the past, but had not succeeded, and that it would use "drastic measures" in the future to suppress anti-government forces.

    The new Prime Minister said that the Kuomintang remnant forces that had fled into Burma would soon be eliminated.

    During the debate on the World Bank loan agreement to Burma signed on May 4th this year, U Ba Yin, one of the opposition leaders and a well-known economist, said that the agreement had harmful effects on the Union of Burma. U Ba Yin said that the annual interest rate of 4.75% was too high. Even at such a high interest rate, the Federal Government could not freely purchase what it wanted, and Burma had to report its economic and financial situation and foreign exchange reserves to the bank. U Ba Yin emphasized that the World Bank is controlled by the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries, and has become an investment institution serving the interests of imperialist countries. U Ba Yin concluded by saying that if domestic peace could be guaranteed, the World Bank loan would not be needed, because a large amount of money could be saved if the civil war were stopped.

    After being put to a vote, the agreement was approved.

    缅甸反对党支持政府的中立政策
    要求通过和谈恢复国内和平
    据新华社仰光16日电　缅甸国会代表院第一次会议已经在六月十四日闭幕。十四日的会议着重讨论了吴巴瑞总理发表的政策演说。
    反对党领袖之一吴登佩密表示支持政府的独立的中立的外交政策。他说，和平中立的外交政策具有反对殖民主义和反对军事集团的性质。他希望新政府将表示更大的决心来反对东南亚条约之类的军事集团。
    吴登佩密在谈到国内问题时说，缅甸的内战是政治见解不同造成的结果。他相信，内战能够通过和平谈判的政策得到解决。他强调说，缅甸人民迫切要求恢复国内和平，国内局势最近已经有很大的变化。而且，地下部队的某些领导人员在进行反对英国殖民主义和日本军国主义者的共同斗争中曾经是现任内阁部长们的同事。吴登佩密要求政府放弃打到底的政策，而采取谈判的政策。
    吴巴瑞总理在答复时说，新内阁将坚决执行独立的中立的外交政策，在执行政策时首先将考虑缅甸联邦的利益。关于国内和平问题，吴巴瑞说，政府过去“一直努力”同共产党领袖谈判，但是没有成功，它将来要使用“剧烈的办法”来镇压反政府军队。
    新总理说，逃窜到缅甸境内的国民党残余部队不久就可以肃清。
    在辩论今年五月四日签订的世界银行给予缅甸贷款的协定时，反对党领袖之一、著名经济学家吴巴迎说，这项协定对缅甸联邦有有害的影响。吴巴迎说，每年4.75％的利率太高了。甚至在这样的高利率下，联邦政府还不能自由采购它想要的东西，缅甸得向该银行报告它的经济和财政状况和外汇储备情况。吴巴迎强调说，世界银行是由美国、英国和其他资本主义国家控制的，它成了为帝国主义国家的利益服务的投资机构。吴巴迎最后说，如果国内和平得到保证，本来可以不要世界银行贷款。因为如果停止内战，就能省下大量金钱。
    在提付表决以后，协定被批准了。
