Changes in the Rural Areas of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture
—Speech by Representative Huang Rong

    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget, the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of this Draft Model Regulations, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.
    From the Second Session to the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, thanks to the vigorous development of the national agricultural collectivization movement, the face of our rural areas has undergone fundamental changes. Along with this new situation, the ethnic minority areas of Guangxi Province have also undergone extremely profound changes. Taking the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture as an example, the number of farm households participating in advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives has reached over 1.75 million, accounting for 96.43% of the total farm households. The historical task of socialist transformation of agriculture has been basically completed within the entire prefecture. The enthusiasm of the masses for production has been unprecedentedly high. In less than half a year, the area of water conservancy projects expanded and the irrigated area increased was equivalent to about 5 times the irrigated area of last year's water conservancy projects. This year's early rice planting area has been expanded by more than 3.59 million mu, exceeding 5 times last year's early rice planting area. In forestry, since this spring, a reforested area of more than 4.53 million mu has been completed, exceeding the total of reforested area in the 6 years since the liberation of the entire prefecture. In order to support production and accelerate the construction of ethnic minority areas, 1,500 kilometers of simple roads were built from January to May this year. In addition, animal husbandry and the production of local specialties in mountainous areas have also developed to varying degrees. Judging from the above main situation, the development of various tasks is very rapid, which also shows the unparalleled superiority of socialism. However, in the process of rapid development, there are also many shortcomings. The comprehensive integration of various tasks is not sufficient, some plans are not practical enough, and the focus on sideline production is not tight enough. At the same time, there are also many difficulties brought by the backward state left over from history. Taking culture as an example, it is far from meeting the requirements of the development of the new situation. Now the work of creating the Zhuang language has been basically completed. The Zhuang people, having a written language adapted to their own language, has undoubtedly laid a favorable foundation for future cultural improvement. I believe that certain shortcomings and difficulties in our work will be overcome one by one, as in the past, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government.
    The people of all ethnic groups in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, whether Zhuang, Yao, Dong, or Miao, have, in their own life experiences, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, in the great family of the motherland, not only obtained the right to ethnic regional autonomy, but also are able to embark on a socialist society like the people of the whole country. Only by taking the socialist road can the people of ethnic minorities fundamentally change their poverty and backwardness and move towards a happier and better life. Now the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture are contributing their strength with joy and excitement to complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan ahead of schedule.

    桂西僮族自治州农村面貌的变化
    ——黄荣代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告、高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）和廖鲁言部长关于这个示范章程草案的说明、彭真副委员长所作全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议到第三次会议期间，由于全国农业合作化运动的蓬勃发展，使我国农村面貌起了根本的变化。随着这个新的形势，广西省少数民族地区，也同样的发生了极其深刻的变化。就以桂西僮族自治州来说，参加高级农业生产合作社的农户即达175万余户，占总农户的96.43％，在全州范围内已基本上完成了农业社会主义改造的历史任务。群众生产的积极性空前高涨，不到半年时间，兴修水利扩大灌溉面积相当于去年兴修水利灌溉面积的5倍左右，今年早稻播种面积已扩大了359万多亩，超过去年早稻播种面积的5倍。林业方面，今春以来，已经完成造林面积453万多亩，超过了全州解放后6年来造林面积的总和。为了支援生产，加速少数民族地区的建设，今年1至5月份修建了简易公路达1，500公里。此外，山区的畜牧业和土特产生产等，也有了不同程度的发展。从上述主要情况来看，各项工作的发展是很快的，也说明了社会主义无比的优越性。但在工作迅速发展的过程中也存在不少缺点，各方面的工作全面地相互结合还不够，有些计划定得还不太切合实际，对副业生产还抓的不紧等。同时，由于历史上遗留下来的落后状态给工作带来的困难也较多。就以文化方面来说，还远不能适应新形势发展的要求；现在僮族的文字创立工作已基本完成，僮族人民有与自己语言相适应的文字之后无疑的对今后文化提高打下了有利的基础，我相信我们工作中存在某些缺点和困难，在党和人民政府的领导下，一定会像过去一样一一被克服的。
    桂西僮族自治州的各族人民，不论是僮族或者是瑶、侗、苗等民族，他们在自己生活体验中，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，在祖国大家庭里，少数民族不但获得了民族区域自治的权利，而且能够同全国人民一样走上社会主义社会。少数民族人民也只有走社会主义的道路，才能从根本上改变贫困与落后的面貌，走向更幸福美好的生活。现在自治州的各族人民正以欢欣鼓舞的心情，为提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划而贡献自己的力量。
