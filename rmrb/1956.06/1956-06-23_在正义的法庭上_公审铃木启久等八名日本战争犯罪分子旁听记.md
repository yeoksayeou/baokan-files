    In the Court of Justice

    ——An Account of Attending the Public Trial of Suzuki Keikichi and Seven Other Japanese War Criminals
    By Our Reporter Li Gao
    Ascending to the visitor's gallery in the courtroom, I looked up at the gleaming national emblem hanging on the wall behind the judge's seat and couldn't help but look down at the ground beneath my feet. It was this sacred land that had been unjustly ravaged by the Japanese militarists' war. Now, on this land, the Chinese people are busy building factories, schools, and agricultural production cooperatives. We have also established this court to conduct a just trial of eight Japanese war criminals with serious crimes who once intruded into our country, killed, set fires, and behaved recklessly. This is not only to settle the past but also to safeguard the future.
    The trial revealed that the crimes of these eight criminals were extremely serious. During the fact-finding investigation, the court first questioned the defendant Shigeru Fujita. The indictment accused him of seven major crimes. One of them was that in April 1939, while serving as a regimental commander, he commanded his subordinates to surround Shangduan Village in Anyi County, Shanxi Province, and kill more than 100 peaceful residents. The court summoned Zhang Putaoshi to testify. She is now an old lady of fifty. At that time, she and other victims were driven to the well. Her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, and a four-year-old daughter were all killed and thrown into the well, and she was also injured and pushed into the well. After she tearfully recounted the incident in court, Fujita Shigeru admitted that "all of this is true, and I am willing to accept any severe punishment." Another crime of Fujita Shigeru was that from the time he was a regimental commander to a division commander, he often instructed his subordinate officers to use living people as "targets" to conduct "courage-testing training" for soldiers, and also ordered "killing prisoners on the battlefield and counting them as battle results." A witness who appeared in court had personally seen and heard Fujita Shigeru give this kind of heinous "instruction" to his subordinates, and described the time and place of his speech clearly during his testimony. In addition, Fujita Shigeru also committed cruel crimes such as forcing peaceful residents to "step on landmines." Every item had witnesses and material evidence confirmed in court. Fujita Shigeru admitted that all of them were true.
    Next, the defendant Suzuki Keikichi was questioned. While serving as a regimental commander and division commander, he ordered his subordinates to create six major massacres of peaceful residents in places such as Panjiadaizhuang in Luan County, Hebei Province. The Panjiadaizhuang massacre alone killed more than 1,280 peaceful residents and burned down more than 1,000 houses. The other six defendants also had many serious crimes. Among them, Kamizaka Masaru created the Beituan Village massacre in Ding County, Hebei Province, which killed more than 800 peaceful residents. Funaki Kenjiro ordered his subordinates to release poison gas on students and residents who were holding sports meets, injuring more than 400 people to demonstrate the "power" of the poison gas. Uno Shintaro cruelly beheaded and abused many of our captured personnel. Sakakibara Hideobu was a well-known bacteriological warfare unit - a branch captain under the former Japanese Kwantung Army "731" unit (i.e., Ishii Unit), who extensively cultivated bacteria, bred fleas, searched for rats, and actively prepared for bacteriological warfare. In addition to witnesses appearing in court to testify about his crimes, Meng Yu, deputy director of the Central Institute of Biological Products, and two other experts appeared in court to make appraisals.
    The trial activities of the Special Military Tribunal fully demonstrate our country's serious, earnest, and pragmatic attitude and high degree of democratic spirit in the work of the procuratorial and judicial organs. The Supreme People's Procuratorate conducted a lengthy investigation into this case and obtained a large amount of conclusive evidence. The crimes charged in the indictment against the eight defendants were based on the accusations of 920 people, the reports of 266 people, and the testimonies of 836 people, and every item was thoroughly investigated. Five days before the opening of the public trial, the Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court sent the indictment and its Japanese translation to each defendant, and appointed defense lawyers for them, giving them time to prepare for the trial. On the first day of the hearing, the presiding judge explained to the defendants that they had full rights to defense. The defense lawyers appointed by the court, with a pragmatic attitude, put forward some circumstances and reasons that were beneficial to the defendants and defended each defendant. Every word in the courtroom was translated into Japanese on the spot to make the defendant understand. In addition, the court also accepted a large number of people to attend the hearing. Regarding these situations, the defendant Fujita Shigeru said in his final statement at the end of the trial: "In this court, I have accepted the Chinese people's solemn, open, and pragmatic trial. Now I am ready to willingly accept the verdict of this court in order to reform myself."
    All the Japanese war criminals on trial expressed remorse and apologized to the Chinese people in court. Suzuki Keikichi said in his final statement: "My means of killing the Chinese people were cruel and inhuman, and cannot be forgotten by the Chinese people. I am willing to accept the most severe punishment and bear full responsibility for my crimes." Kamizaka Masaru said after mentioning his crimes: "Even if a person like me is sentenced to death, it cannot compensate for the crimes I committed in the past. I now sincerely apologize to the Chinese people and am willing to accept any punishment."
    The court made a just judgment based on the circumstances of each defendant's crime and the principle of leniency.
    I interviewed some victims who testified in court. The Japanese war criminals killed their relatives and injured their bodies in those years. However, like millions of strong Chinese sons and daughters, they got up and fought more resolutely against the Japanese invaders. Victory always belongs to justice. Li Zuoqin, who was harmed by them, is now the deputy director of a senior agricultural production cooperative in the tea area of Laiwu County, Shandong Province. Li Dexiang, who became an orphan at that time, is now the production captain of the Mingxing Senior Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ding County, Hebei Province. Zhang Putaoshi, who lost her husband and parents-in-law, is now the kind grandmother of a happy family in an agricultural production cooperative. Everyone is building a happy socialist life in different places. Li Zuoqin stroked his gray beard and said to me: "It is unprecedented for our country to try foreign war criminals. This is because the country is strong and has a position. The government has upheld justice for us." Li Dexiang said: "Thinking of my relatives, it would not be enough to relieve my hatred by sentencing them to death. But seeing that they all bowed their heads and confessed their crimes, and their ferocity has been worn away, I feel that they can be treated leniently."

    在正义的法庭上
    ——公审铃木启久等八名日本战争犯罪分子旁听记
    本报记者　李高
    走上法庭的旁听席，抬头望到高悬在审判长座后墙上的金光闪耀的国徽的时候，我不禁低头看看脚下的土地。就是这圣洁的土地，当年却曾无辜地遭受过日本军国主义者的战争蹂躏。现在，中国人民正在这土地上忙着建立工厂、学校和农业生产合作社，也建立了这样一个法庭，对曾经闯进我国杀人放火、胡作非为的八名罪行严重的日本战争犯罪分子进行正义的审判。这不只是为了清算过去，也是为了保卫未来。
    审判中揭露出来，这八名罪犯的罪行都是非常严重的。法庭在进行事实调查时，首先讯问了被告人藤田茂。起诉书上控告他的主要罪行有七大项。其中一项是1939年4月他担任联队长时，指挥命令部下包围山西安邑县的上段村，杀害和平居民一百余人。法庭传召了张葡萄出庭作证。她现在是五十岁的老太太了，当时她和其他被害人一起被赶到井边，她的公公、婆婆、丈夫和一个四岁的女儿都被杀害投入井内，她也被打伤推入井内。在她当庭哭诉了事件的经过后，藤田茂供认这“一切都是事实，我愿接受任何严厉处分”。藤田茂的另一项罪行是他从当联队长到师团长期间，经常训示部下军官要用活人作“靶”来对士兵进行“试胆教练”，又曾下令“将俘虏在战场杀掉算入战果”。出庭的一个证人过去曾亲自看到、亲耳听到藤田茂向他的部下作这种罪恶“训示”，在作证中把他当时说话的时间、场合都叙述得清清楚楚。此外，藤田茂还有强迫和平居民“踏探地雷”等残酷罪行，每一项都有人证、物证当庭证实。藤田茂都一一供认属实。
    接着被讯问的被告人铃木启久。在他先后任联队长和师团长时，曾命令部下在河北滦县潘家戴庄等处所制造的集体屠杀和平居民的大惨案六起，其中潘家戴庄惨案就杀害了和平居民一千二百八十余人，烧毁民房一千余间。其他六名被告人也都各有许多项严重罪行。其中上坂胜曾制造杀害八百余名和平居民的河北定县北疃村惨案。船木健次郎曾命令部下对开运动会的学生和居民施放毒气伤害四百余人来显示毒气“威力”。鹈野晋太郎曾残酷地砍杀和虐杀许多我被俘人员。榊原秀夫是人所周知的细菌战部队——原日本关东军“七三一”部队（即石井部队）下的一个支队长，曾大规模培养细菌、繁殖跳蚤、搜养老鼠，积极准备进行细菌战。对他的罪行，除了有证人出庭作证外，还由中央生物制品研究所副所长孟雨等三名专家出庭作了鉴定。
    特别军事法庭的审判活动，充分表现着我国的检察、审判机关工作中的严肃认真、实事求是的态度和高度的民主精神。最高人民检察院对这一案件进行了长期的侦讯，取得了大量的确凿的罪证。起诉书上所控告的八名被告人的犯罪事实，是根据920人的控诉、266人的检举、836人的证词，把每一项都查得水落石出了的。最高人民法院特别军事法庭在开庭公审前五天，就把起诉书和日文译本送达了各被告人，并为他们指定了辩护人，使他们都有时间进行出庭的准备。在开庭第一天，审判长向被告人解释了他们有充分的辩护的权利。法庭指定的辩护人，都以实事求是的态度，提出了有利于被告人的一些情节和理由，为每一被告人作了辩护。法庭上的每一句话，都当庭用日文翻译出来，使被告了解。另外，法庭还接纳了大量的人出庭旁听。对于这些情况，被告人藤田茂在审讯终结时的最后陈述中说：“我在这个法庭里，接受了中国人民严肃的、光明正大的、实事求是的审判。现在我准备心甘情愿接受这个法庭的判决，以便改过自新。”
    所有受审的日本战争犯罪分子，在法庭上都作了悔罪和向中国人民谢罪的表示。铃木启久在最后陈述中说：“我杀害中国人民的手段，是残忍的、毫无人性的，是中国人民所不能忘记的，我愿接受最严厉的惩罚，对我的罪行担负全部责任。”上坂胜在提到自己的罪行后说：“我这样的人，就是判处死刑，也不能弥补我过去所犯的罪行。我现在诚恳地向中国人民谢罪，而且愿意接受任何一种处罚。”
    法庭根据各个被告人的犯罪情节和宽大处理的原则，作出了正义的判决。
    我访问了出庭作证的一些受害人，日本战争犯罪分子当年杀害了他们的亲人、伤害了他们的身体，但是，和千百万坚强的中国儿女一样，他们爬起来又更坚决地和日本侵略者进行斗争。胜利永远是属于正义的。受过他们的伤害的李作芹现在已是山东莱芜县茶叶区的一个高级农业生产合作社副主任，当时变成了孤儿的李德祥现在是河北定县明星高级农业生产合作社的生产队长，丧失了丈夫和公婆的张葡萄已是一个农业生产合作社员的幸福家庭的慈祥的祖母了。大家都在不同的地方建设着幸福的社会主义生活。李作芹抚摸着斑白的胡须对我说：“我们国家审判外国战争罪犯，这是从没有过的事。这是国家有力量了，有地位了。政府给我们申张了正义。”李德祥说：“想起我的亲人，判他们死刑也不解恨。可是看他们都低头认罪，凶气磨下去了，我觉得对他们可以宽大处理。”
