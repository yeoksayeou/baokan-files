    An Electronic Analog Computer's Calculation Performance
    On May 26th, this newspaper's reporter visited an electronic analog computer successfully imitated at Fudan University, and witnessed a successful calculation performance given by Lai Zuwu, a young lecturer and one of the workers who imitated this computer.
    The appearance of this computer is like an ordinary household wardrobe, with several potentiometers and oscilloscopes installed on it. After the performer arranged a set of fourth-order constant coefficient differential equations on the machine's potentiometers, he pressed a button, and instantly a correct green graphical solution appeared on the milky white oscilloscope. The performer told the visitors that it would take dozens of hours to calculate this set of equations manually. Professor Wang Fushan, head of the Physics Department of Fudan University, explained several questions raised by the visitors. He said that this machine was designed and assembled according to the basic principles of the Soviet ЭЛИ-type electronic analog computer designer Gutonmacher. It can solve fourth-order constant coefficient differential equations, and can also solve some special types of nonlinear differential equation problems, and find the roots of algebraic equations corresponding to the differential equation set, which is useful for teaching and engineering.
  Editor's Note: The electronic computer mentioned in the news "An Electronic Computer Made at Fudan University" on the front page of this newspaper on May 26th should be accurately called an electronic analog computer. At the same time, other units had imitated similar computers before this. This kind of electronic analog computer is essentially different from the electronic computer mentioned in the article "A New Scientific Department - Automatic Fast Electronic Computer" on the third page of this newspaper on November 14, 1955; this kind of electronic analog computer does not have the special functions of electronic computers such as translation, relatively accurate weather forecasting, universal control applications, and replacing some of the human brain's labor.
    Because the previous report was not clear enough and could easily cause misunderstandings, we hereby provide the following supplementary explanation.

### 一台电子模拟计算机的演算表演

    一台电子模拟计算机的演算表演
    五月二十六日本报记者参观了在复旦大学仿制成功的一台电子模拟计算机，并看到了仿制这台计算机的工作者之一、青年讲师赖祖武所作的成功的演算表演。
    这台计算机的外形，如同普通家用的衣橱，上面安有若干电位盘和示波器等零件，表演者将一组四阶常系数微分方程式安排在这架机器的电位盘上以后，一按电钮，顷刻间在乳白色的示波器上就出现了正确的绿色图解。表演者告诉参观的人们说：这组方程式如果用人力计算却需要几十个小时。复旦大学物理系主任王福山教授对参观者提出的若干问题作了说明，他说：这架机器是根据苏联ЭЛИ—型电子模拟计算机设计人古顿马赫尔的基本原理设计装制的，它能解四阶常系数微分方程式，还能解某些特殊类型的非线性微分方程问题，求得对应于微分方程组的代数方程组的根对教学和工程方面都有用处。
  编者按：五月二十六日本报一版“一架电子计算机在复旦大学制成”的消息中所说的电子计算机，准确的字名应为电子模拟计算机。同时，在此以前，已经有其他单位仿制过同类的计算机。这种电子模拟计算机同本报1955年11月14日第三版“一个新的科学部门——自动快速电子计算机”一文中所说的电子计算机有着本质上的不同；电子计算机所具有的特殊功用如翻译、相当准确的天气预报、普遍控制应用、代替人类部分大脑的劳动等，这种电子模拟计算机都是没有的。
    由于前次报道不够清楚，容易使人引起误解，现特补充说明如上。
