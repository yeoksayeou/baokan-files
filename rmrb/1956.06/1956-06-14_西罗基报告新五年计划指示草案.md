Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 13th. The National Conference of the Czechoslovak Communist Party continued on June 12th. In the morning, the delegates discussed the report made by Novotný on the current situation and the tasks of the Party.

In the afternoon session, the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Široký, delivered a report on the draft directives of the CPC Central Committee regarding the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy (1956-1960).

In his report, Široký first talked about the great achievements made by the Czechoslovak national economy in the past few years. He then pointed out that the main purpose of the new Five-Year Plan is to "basically complete the construction of the material and technical base of socialism." The draft directives guarantee "a significant increase in industrial production, prioritizing the development of the means of production, while accelerating the development of agricultural production and increasing the production of consumer goods." In the next five years, the total industrial output will increase by about 50%, the production of means of production will increase by 57%, and the output of consumer goods will increase by 40%. The draft also stipulates maximizing the development of production and capital construction in the fields of fuel, power, minerals and other raw material bases.

Široký emphasized that adopting the latest international level technology to improve labor productivity is of great significance. He said that it is necessary to modernize existing machines and equipment, and to make the most extensive use of the favorable conditions of effective specialization and cooperation in industry, in order to implement specialized production. He also said that the peaceful use of atomic energy will create a completely new environment for our lives.

When talking about agriculture, he pointed out the importance of solving the problem of overcoming the backwardness of agricultural production. He said that it is necessary to move more boldly along the road of building large-scale cooperative production. The draft directives stipulate an increase in the total value of agricultural output by about 30%, with meat and dairy products increasing even faster.

He continued by saying that the entire efforts of the Party and the government are aimed at improving the welfare of the working people. He then talked about shortening the weekly working hours; improving the wage system in order to better implement the socialist principle of remuneration; and more fully implementing the principle of democratic centralism in the economy, etc.

Široký said that all the efforts of the government should be focused on solving the main problems of socialist construction. He also pointed out the importance of launching a constant struggle against bureaucracy.

In concluding his report, Comrade Široký emphasized the economic cooperation between socialist countries, considering it the most important international condition for further developing the Czechoslovak economy. He said that Czechoslovakia's greatest contribution to strengthening world peace is to further enhance its contribution in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism.
