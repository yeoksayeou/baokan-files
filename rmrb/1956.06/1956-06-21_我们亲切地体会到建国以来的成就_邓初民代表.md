Impressions of industrial production in Shijiazhuang, Yangquan, and Taiyuan: Great industrial development, high enthusiasm for learning among workers – there are still some difficulties and problems in transportation, raw materials, equipment, and product quality.

Issues and opinions to be reflected: Equipment, labor protection, and employee benefits in joint state-private factories are far behind – integrate quota work with the advanced producer movement – workers' housing and vegetable supply problems urgently need to be solved.

In the solemn and simple hall of the National People's Congress, I wholeheartedly agree with and support the various reports made at this meeting with unparalleled excitement and encouragement, and I suggest that the congress approve and pass them. At the same time, I will give a brief report to the congress on the situation of the seven state-owned factories and mines (Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, Yangquan Mining Bureau No. 3 Mine, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant, and Lanchun Paper Mill); three local state-owned factories (Hebei Power Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Woolen Mill, and Taiyuan Iron Factory); and two joint state-private factories (Taiyuan Zhongyuan Glass Factory, Taiyuan Dazhong Machinery Repair Factory) in the three cities of Shijiazhuang, Yangquan, and Taiyuan and their suburban collective areas, which were inspected collectively or individually with Representatives Kang Yonghe and Member Pu Xixiu. We not only visited factories and mines, but also went deep into workshops, dormitories, canteens, and after-school cultural learning places, and held individual talks and symposiums with some workers, a few advanced producers, and relevant personnel. In particular, we listened to a special report from Taiyuan City on urban planning and basic construction, and industrial issues. This series of activities made us deeply appreciate how encouraging the achievements since the founding of the People's Republic are!

In just a few years, the development of these cities and factories has been astonishing. More than a decade ago, Shijiazhuang could be toured all over during the time it took to wait for a train. Now, it takes half a day to drive around by car. Before liberation, there was only one Daxing Yarn Factory, but now there are six large cotton textile factories, and it is developing into a modern light industrial city with considerable scale. Before liberation, Yangquan City had only six factories and mines, but now it has more than 30 factories and mines, and many construction units are under construction. Recently, new discoveries have been made of various treasures hidden underground, and undoubtedly Yangquan City will also become a modern industrial and mining area. What makes us particularly excited is the industrial achievements of Taiyuan City and its beautiful and grand prospects. Taiyuan City has now become a fairly modern industrial base with a population of 830,000. Before liberation, the city had only 27 factories and mines, but now there are 52 production factories and mines alone, plus 36 construction units, making a total of 88; before liberation, there were only more than 20,000 workers and staff, but now there are more than 120,000, an increase of six times. The speed of development is so fast that one really feels "spring grass grows in the pond, and orioles sing in the willows in the garden!" (Lines from a poem by Xie Lingyun).

These three cities are all developing production cities. Taking the Shijiazhuang Automobile Repair Factory, established in 1948, as an example, it was a very small repair factory at that time, but now it has become a power machinery factory with more than 2,300 people, capable of manufacturing more than 1,000 boiler locomotives and more than 60,000 double-wheeled double-share plows. The total output value of the factory this year (31 million to 35 million yuan) is 3.5 times more than last year (9.1 million yuan). Taking the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory as another example, before liberation, there were only more than 1,800 workers and staff, but now there are more than 13,700 people; before liberation, the highest annual steel output was only about 15,000 tons, but now the annual output is 200,000 tons, and in the future, it will become a large-scale iron and steel complex with a larger annual output of high-quality steel.

The development of state-owned and local state-owned factories has been rapid, and the development of joint state-private factories has not been slow either. In the current upsurge of socialist transformation, the Taiyuan Dazhong Machinery Repair Factory, which is a joint state-private venture of 10 small private iron factories, will have a total output value this year that is nearly four times more than last year.

Not only have all factories made great leaps in production, but they are also launching or have already launched a wave of marching towards science in terms of cultural learning. The call of the Party Central Committee has already generated strength among the masses. Literacy campaigns and after-school primary and secondary schools are available in every factory. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory, and the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory have everything from literacy to night universities. Both workers and cadres are very enthusiastic about learning culture and marching towards science.

Of course, with the development of industrial production, many difficulties and problems have also arisen. The most prominent are:

(1) Transportation lags behind production, causing serious difficulties in the output of factory products and the supply of raw materials.

(2) The advanced producer movement has greatly improved production capacity, but steel, raw cotton, machinery and equipment cannot be supplied, which has affected the enthusiasm of the masses to a certain extent.

(3) Poor quality and non-compliance with product specifications are still a serious problem.

The above are our impressions of industrial production, as well as the problems that the province, city, and various factories and mines have asked us to report to the leadership and our opinions.

(1) After the joint state-private factories were merged, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high, production increased, and living conditions also improved. However, due to historical reasons, equipment, labor protection, dormitories, and employee benefits cannot keep up and are far behind. For example, the workers of the Taiyuan joint state-private Dazhong Machinery Repair Factory reported: "We work in the sun, hold meetings squatting down, eat standing up, study crawling, and sleep getting rained on." Leading cadres in the province, city, and factory said that they also knew the problem was very serious, but they did not have the money and it was not easy to solve, so they wanted to ask the leadership to consider whether they could change the use of relevant public welfare funds, that is, allocate a portion of the public welfare funds to solve the problems of labor protection and employee benefits. Of course, this is only a temporary expedient measure and cannot fundamentally solve the problem.

(2) Regarding the distribution of planned profits and excess profits in state-owned enterprises, most comrades advocate leaving 60% to the enterprise, 20% to the ministry or bureau, and the other 20% to the local leading organs.

(3) The three cities of Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and Yangquan all feel that the transportation problem cannot keep pace with the development of production. Therefore, Taiyuan City hopes that the Ministry of Railways will build a railway branch line between Taiyuan and the Xishan Gypsum Factory in order to supply gypsum to 19 cement factories across the country in a timely manner. A light railway also needs to be built between Taiyuan and the suburban stone factory in order to supply the increasingly numerous construction units with stones and stone chips in a timely manner.

(4) Supplying industrial water to Taiyuan and preventing this industrial base from suffering from floods is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. The construction of the Fenhe Reservoir was proposed to the congress by the Shanxi delegation at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress last year, but it has not yet been clearly affirmed, so that it is impossible to mobilize civilian manpower to cooperate with the construction and facilitate the design of water sources for new factories. It is hoped that the construction will be approved in a timely manner to alleviate the urgent need.

(5) The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture requires that various machines equipped with tractors should arrive at the same time as the tractors. Now, some tractors have been transported, but they are idle and cannot be used because other machines have not been transported, which is equivalent to waste.

(6) The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory requests that 50,000 yuan be allocated from its existing 150,000 yuan medical expenses deposit to build an after-school sanatorium. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory hopes that the ministry and bureau will determine the product direction as soon as possible. The Taiyuan Iron Factory hopes that the First and Second Ministry of Machinery Industry will sell them some of the machine tools that have been reduced or are idle in the warehouse due to technical transformation, and also asks relevant departments to pay attention.

(7) The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory and the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory both feel that the proportion of labor insurance funds submitted is too large, and hope to leave more at the grassroots level. Many factories hope that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will take measures to properly transfer the old, weak, and disabled in the factories so that they can retire or receive treatment.

(8) The convening of the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Producers has made cadres and the masses in various factories and mines pay more attention to the advanced producer movement, and the promotion of advanced experience is also more serious and meticulous than in the past. However, how to closely integrate quota work with the advanced producer movement, and pay attention to consolidating and developing the achievements of the advanced producer movement by improving the lives of workers, has become the key issue in whether this movement can be carried out persistently and normally. Some factories do not have quotas, or the quotas are inaccurate, especially when workers compress the quotas and then immediately modify the quotas, which has caused undue resistance to the advanced producer movement. After the launch of the advanced producer movement, although the vast majority of workers rarely care about personal issues, leaders cannot ignore the reasonable material demands of workers. At the First Congress of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the First Machinery Trade Union held on May 28, how to consolidate and promote the advanced producer movement from the perspective of material interests has become the most prominent issue in the representatives' speeches and proposals.

(9) Although the dormitories of various factories and mines have been constantly renovated and built a lot in recent years, they still cannot keep up with the actual needs. Factories that can accommodate 50% of the workers are considered very good, and many factories and mines have 50%-80%-90% of the workers whose dormitories have not been resolved. Some factories and mines have promoted the method of self-construction with public assistance, which has achieved certain results, but they are currently encountering difficulties such as no land, no materials, and no one contracting the construction.

(10) The grain supply for workers has been satisfactorily resolved, but there are still many difficulties in the supply of vegetables, meat, and daily necessities. The untimely supply of vegetables and the high price of vegetables are a common phenomenon. Workers at the Shanxi Machinery Factory have to stand in line for 50 minutes to get a meal. Local governments and factories and mines are working hard to solve these problems, but the satisfactory solution to the dormitory problem still needs to be considered uniformly by the national leadership organs.

The above are the reflected problems and difficulties, but these are only difficulties in the process of progress. Generally speaking, we believe that since the Second Session of the National People's Congress, the great motherland has been advancing with great strides on all fronts and in every corner. Socialist relations of production have achieved a decisive victory, the brotherly alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals has been increasingly consolidated, socialist construction that is more, faster, better, and more economical has been increasingly carried out, and the academic policy of marching towards science and culture, letting a hundred flowers bloom, and letting a hundred schools of thought contend has made everyone's mood even more boiling. In particular, the unparalleled superiority of the people's democratic system and socialist production is driving people to shout from the bottom of their hearts: Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao can we not only be the masters of the country, but also the masters of the universe.

Examining and approving the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, deliberating on the draft model charter on advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, etc., are the main agendas of this meeting. Many of the problems we have reflected have also been noted and addressed in these reports. Through this meeting, through our continuous efforts, the fate of the country and the fate of the universe will forever be in our hands, continuing to advance victoriously and continue to move forward!

    我们亲切地体会到建国以来的成就
    ——邓初民代表
    对石家庄、阳泉、太原三个城市的工业生产的观感：工业有很大发展，职工学习热情很高——交通、原料设备、产品质量方面都还有一些困难和问题
    要反映的问题和意见：公私合营厂的设备、劳动保护、职工的福利等差得很远，——使定额工作同先进生产者运动结合好，——职工的住房和菜蔬供应问题亟待解决
    我在这一年一次的全国人民代表大会庄严朴素的会场上，以无比兴奋鼓舞的心情，同意和拥护这次会议上所作的各项报告，并建议大会予以批准和通过。同时，把我和康永和代表、浦熙修委员在石家庄、阳泉、太原3个城市及郊区集体的或者个别的视察了7个国营厂矿（石家庄第二棉纺织厂、阳泉矿务局第三矿、太原重型机器厂、太原钢铁厂、太原矿山机器厂、太原热电厂、兰村纸厂）；3个地方国营工厂（河北省动力机械厂、太原毛织厂、太原铁工厂）；两个公私合营工厂（太原中元玻璃厂、太原大中机械修造厂）的情况向大会作一简单的汇报。我们不仅看了厂矿，而且深入到车间、宿舍、食堂、业余文化学习场所，和一些职工、少数先进生产者及有关人员进行过个别谈话和座谈会。特别听取了太原市关于城市规划和基本建设、工业问题的专门汇报。这一系列的活动使我们亲切地体会到建国以来的成就多么令人欢欣鼓舞！
    在短短的几年中，这些城市和工厂的发展是惊人的，十多年前的石家庄，利用等火车的时间就可以游遍全市，现在坐汽车还得跑半天。解放前只有1个大兴纱厂，现在已有了6个大棉纺厂，而且正在向着一个具有相当规模的现代化的轻工业城市发展。阳泉市解放前只有6个厂矿，现已有了30多个厂矿，还有许多基建单位正在施工。最近，地下蕴藏的各种宝藏又有新的发现，无疑地阳泉市也将变为一个现代化的工矿区。使我们特别感到兴奋的是太原市工业的成就及其美丽伟大的远景。太原市现在已经成了相当现代化的工业基地，人口83万人。解放前该市只有厂矿27个，现在单就生产厂矿来说就有52个，加上36个基建单位共有88个；解放前只有2万多职工，现在是12万多人，增加到6倍。发展的速度这样快，真令人有“池塘生春草，园柳变鸣禽”（谢灵运诗句）之感！
    这3个城市都是正在发展的生产城市。先以1948年成立的石家庄汽车修理厂为例，当时是个很小的修理厂，现已成为能制造1千多台锅驼机、6万多部双轮双铧犁的2，300多人的动力机械厂。该厂今年的生产总值（3，100万——3，500万元）比去年（910万元）增加到3倍半。再以太原钢铁厂为例，解放前只有1，800多职工，现已是13，700多人；解放前钢的最高年产量只有15，000吨左右，现在的年产量是20万吨，将来就会成为年产量更大的优质钢的大型钢铁联合企业。
      国营、地方国营厂的发展很快，公私合营厂的发展也不慢。在目前社会主义改造高潮中，由10个小私营铁工厂公私合营的太原大中机械修造厂，今年的总产值比去年的增加将近4倍。
    各个工厂不只在生产上有了突飞猛进的发展，在文化学习方面也正在掀起或已经掀起了向科学进军的热潮，党中央的号召在群众中已经产生了力量。扫盲运动和业余的中、小学校各个工厂都有，太原矿山机器厂、太原钢铁厂、太原重型机器厂，从扫盲到夜大学样样都有。不论工人和干部，学习文化、向科学进军的热情都是很高的。
    当然，随着工业生产的发展，也带来了许多的困难和问题，最为突出的是：
      （1）交通运输落在生产的后面，使工厂产品的输出和原材料的供应发生了严重的困难。
      （2）先进生产者运动使生产能力大大提高，但是钢材、原棉、机器设备等却供应不上，使群众的积极性在一定程度上受到了影响。
      （3）质量不好，产品不合乎规格的现象仍旧是一个严重问题。
    以上是我们对工业生产的观感，同时还有省、市和各厂矿要求我们向领导上反映的问题及我们的意见。
      （1）公私合营的工厂合营后，群众积极性很高，生产增加，生活方面也有改善。但因历史原因，设备、劳动保护、宿舍及职工的福利等跟不上而且差的很远。如太原公私合营大中机械修造厂的工人反映：“我们是晒着干活，蹲着开会，站着吃饭，爬着学习，淋着睡觉。”省、市和厂的领导干部说他们也知道问题很严重，但是没有钱，不容易解决问题，所以想请领导上考虑是否可以改变有关公积金的使用，即从公积金中拨出一部分钱，解决劳动保护和职工的福利问题。当然，这也只是暂时权宜办法，还不能根本解决问题。
      （2）国营企业中的计划利润和超额利润的分配，一般同志们都主张给企业中留60％，20％交部、局，另外的20％交地方领导机关。
      （3）太原、石家庄、阳泉3个市都感到交通问题不能随着生产的发展而发展。因此，太原市希望铁道部在太原到西山石膏厂之间建立一条铁路支线，以便及时地把石膏供给全国各地的19个水泥厂。太原和郊区石子厂之间也需要建立轻便铁道，以便适时供应越来越多的基建单位所需的石子、石片等。
      （4）供应太原工业用水，和防止这个工业基地免受水患，是个急需解决的问题，兴建汾河水库，山西代表组在去年第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议已向大会提过案，但至今尚未明确肯定，以致不能动员民力配合施工，并便利于新建工厂水源的设计。希望及时批准施工以救眉急。
      （5）山西省农业厅要求配备拖拉机的各种机械应该与拖拉机同时到达。现在有些拖拉机运到了，但因其他机械未运到即闲着不能用，等于废物。
      （6）太原重型机器厂要求从其现有15万医药费存款中拨出5万元修建业余疗养所。太原矿山机器厂希望部、局把产品方向及早确定。太原铁工厂希望第一、第二机械工业部将技术改造厂多下来的或闲存在库房的机床卖给他们一些，也要请有关部门注意。
      （7）太原钢铁厂、太原重型机器厂都嫌劳动保险金上缴的比例数太大，希望多给基层留一些。许多工厂都希望全国总工会采取措施，把工厂里的老、弱、残废，妥善地调离，以便养老或治疗。
      （8）全国先进生产者代表会议的召开，使各个厂矿的干部和群众对先进生产者运动更加重视了，对先进经验的推广也比过去认真细致了。但是如何使定额工作和先进生产者运动紧密结合好，并注意从改善职工的生活来巩固和发展先进生产者运动的成就，已成了当前能否使这一运动持久地、正常地开展的关键问题。一些工厂里没有定额，或定额不准确，特别是工人压缩定额后便立即修改定额等，使先进生产者运动已经受到不应有的阻力。在先进生产者运动开展后，广大职工虽然很少计较个人问题，但是领导者却不可忽视工人在物质方面的合理要求，5月28日召开的第一机械工会太原市委员会第一次代表大会上，如何从物质利益方面巩固和推进先进生产者运动，已经成为代表发言中和提案中最为突出的问题。
      （9）各个厂矿的职工宿舍几年来虽然不断的修盖了很多，但仍然赶不上实际的需要，能够容纳50％职工的工厂就算很好的，许多厂矿有50％—80％—90％的职工宿舍未能解决。有的厂矿推行自建公助的办法，取得了一定效果，但目前又遇到了没有地皮，没有材料，没有人承包施工等等困难。
      （10）职工们的粮食供应已经得到圆满的解决，但菜蔬、肉类和日用品的供应却存在着许多困难。菜蔬供应不及时，菜价太贵，是一个普遍的现象。山西机器厂工人排队站50分钟才能吃上饭。这类问题地方上和厂矿正在努力解决，不过宿舍问 题的圆满解决，还得由国家领导机关来统一考虑。
    以上是反映的问题和困难，但这只是前进中的困难。总的说来，我们认为从全国人民代表大会第二次会议到现在，伟大的祖国在各个战线和各个角落里，都正在以巨大的步伐迈进着，社会主义的生产关系已取得决定性的胜利，工、农、知识分子的兄弟联盟日益巩固，又多、又快、又好、又省的社会主义建设日益开展，向科学文化进军、百花齐放、百家争鸣的学术方针已使得每个人的心情更加沸腾，特别是人民民主制度和社会主义生产无比的优越性，推动着人们从心底里叫喊出：只有在共产党、人民政府和毛主席的领导下，才能使我们不仅做了国家的主人，而且要做宇宙的主人。
    审查和批准1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，审议关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案等等，是这次会议的主要议程，我们反映的许多问题，也在这些报告中有了注意和解决办法，通过这次会议，通过我们不断的努力，国家的命运和宇宙的命运都将永远掌握在我们的手中，继续不断地向前胜利、向前迈进！
