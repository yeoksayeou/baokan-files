Xinhua News Agency, June 1st, Rome Dispatch from TASS: The Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party issued a statement on the results of the local autonomous institution elections, stating that the voters who voted for the candidates of the left-wing parties in the local elections "guaranteed the people's forces to manage thousands of towns and dozens of provinces, and once again repelled the reactionary groups' attempts to prevent the working people from advancing along the democratic and socialist path."

The statement said: "The strengthening of the Communist Party's position and the progress of the Italian Socialist Party prove the correctness and necessity of the policy of unity of socialist forces and workers' forces. This is a new impetus for development to the left, which will create the best conditions for establishing left-wing majorities in towns and provinces."
