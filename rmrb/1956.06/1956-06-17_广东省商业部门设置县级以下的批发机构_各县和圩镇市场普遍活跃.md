    Guangdong Province's Commercial Departments Establish Wholesale Organizations Below the County Level
    Markets in Various Counties and Rural Towns Are Generally Active

    (By our newspaper) The work of extending state-owned commercial industrial product wholesale organizations in Guangdong Province to key rural towns below the county level has been fully launched. Recently, about one thousand wholesale organizations have been established in various rural towns.

    After the extension of state-owned commercial wholesale organizations, markets in various counties and rural towns have generally become more active. Supply and marketing cooperatives have increased the variety of goods, and turnover has increased significantly. The class C and D cigarettes and Half Maple Lotus wine in Renju Town, Pingyuan County, which had been out of stock for a long time, are now back in supply. The supply and marketing cooperative in this town has also added curry powder and pepper for seasoning, which the masses are very satisfied with. As soon as the wholesale organization in Pao Tai Town, Jieyang County, was established, the turnover of the supply and marketing cooperative on the first day increased twice that of the previous day. Since then, the daily turnover has been more than double that of the past. Chen Xiean, a small merchant in Du Hu Town, Taishan County, who had been out of business for a long time, has now resumed business with a source of goods. The operating enthusiasm of the joint venture shops and merchants in Lihu Town, Puning County, has been greatly improved, and they are carrying out sales competitions.

    Guangdong Province is preparing to complete the work of extending state-owned commercial organizations before the end of June to welcome the supply of goods during the peak season.

    广东省商业部门设置县级以下的批发机构
    各县和圩镇市场普遍活跃
    本报讯　广东省国营商业工业品批发机构下伸到县城以下重点圩镇的工作已经全面展开。最近在各地圩镇设立的批发机构共有一千个左右。
    国营商业批发机构下伸后，各县圩镇市场普遍趋于活跃。供销社增加了商品品种，营业额显著上升。平远县仁居镇的丙丁级香烟和半枫荷酒脱销已久，现在又恢复供应了。这个镇的供销社还新添了调味用的加里粉和胡椒面，群众很满意。揭阳县炮台镇的批发机构刚一成立，供销社第一天的营业额就比前一天增加两倍。以后每天的营业额都比过去多一倍以上。台山县都斛镇百货小商陈燮安歇业已久，现在有了货源，又复业了。普宁县鲤湖镇合营商店和商贩们的经营积极性大大提高，正在开展推销竞赛活动。
    广东全省国营商业机构下伸的工作，准备争取在六月底以前全部完成，以迎接旺季的物资供应工作。
