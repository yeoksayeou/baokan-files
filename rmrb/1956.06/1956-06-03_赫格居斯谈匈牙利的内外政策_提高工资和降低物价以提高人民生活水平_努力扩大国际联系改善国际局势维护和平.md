Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 1st: According to a TASS report from Budapest, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, Hégédüs, spoke to several thousand workers at the Budapest Rákosi Metallurgical and Machine Manufacturing United Factory on May 31st, discussing some important issues in Hungary's domestic and foreign policies.

Hégédüs said that our second Five-Year Plan stipulates a 25% increase in the living standards of the working people. To achieve this, we must pay special attention to the correct allocation of investment, improving labor productivity, and raising the level of industrial technology. There are two ways to improve living standards: raising wages and lowering commodity prices. Raising wages can eliminate some inappropriate and erroneous phenomena that still exist in the labor remuneration system.

Hégédüs further pointed out that one of the most important conditions for improving the living standards of the working people is to ensure that residents have housing. The second Five-Year Plan stipulates the construction of 200,000 new housing units.

Hégédüs also talked about streamlining state organs and management institutions. He said that the main shortcoming in this area is bureaucracy resulting from excessive centralization. Local leaders should have broader powers and bear greater responsibilities. Another important task is to educate state organ staff to respect the law and abide by the socialist legal system. Many measures have already been taken in this regard. Under the instructions of the Party, the government is doing everything possible to eradicate bureaucratic leadership methods in state organs.

When talking about foreign policy, Hégédüs pointed out that the Hungarian government hopes to expand international ties. The Hungarian government advocates improving the international situation and safeguarding peace not only in words but also in deeds.

Hégédüs spoke about the agreements recently signed between Hungary and Yugoslavia on financial and economic issues. He emphasized that the success of the Hungarian-Yugoslav talks was due to the genuine desire of both sides to reach an agreement.

    赫格居斯谈匈牙利的内外政策

    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯一日讯：匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席赫格居斯五月三十一日对布达佩斯拉科西冶金和机器制造联合工厂的几千名职工讲话时谈到了匈牙利内政和外交政策中的一些重要问题。
    赫格居斯说，我们的第二个五年计划规定把劳动人民的生活水平提高25％。为了达到这点，必须特别注意正确地分配投资，提高劳动生产率和工业技术水平。提高生活水平有两条道路：提高工资和降低商品价格。提高工资可以消灭劳动报酬制度中仍然存在的一些不适当的和错误的现象。
    赫格居斯又指出，提高劳动人民生活水平的非常重要的条件之一就是保证居民得到住宅。第二个五年计划规定建筑二十万套新的住房。
    赫格居斯还谈到精简国家机关和管理机构的问题。他说，这方面主要的缺点就是由于过分集中而产生的官僚主义。地方领导人员应该有更广泛的权力并且承担更大的责任。此外的重要任务之一就是教育国家机关工作人员尊重法律，使他们遵守社会主义法制。在这方面已经采取了许多措施。政府按照党的指示在尽一切可能铲除国家机关中官僚主义的领导方法。
    赫格居斯讲到外交政策的问题的时候指出，匈牙利政府希望扩大国际联系。匈牙利政府不仅在口头上、而且在行动上主张改善国际局势和维护和平。
    赫格居斯讲到了匈牙利和南斯拉夫两国不久以前签订的关于财政和经济问题的协定。他着重指出，匈牙利和南斯拉夫的会谈所以获得成就，是因为双方都真正希望达成协议。
