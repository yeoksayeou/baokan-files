The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, attended by Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the South African Federation, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Southern Rhodesia, will be held in London on June 27th. This conference faces a rapidly developing international situation and a further sharpening of the federal crisis. Reports from foreign newspapers and news agencies show that the British government is suffering from a series of serious domestic and international problems, hoping to improve Britain's situation and strengthen the British Empire's position through this conference.

The evolution of the international situation after the war has been fiercely impacting and shaking the foundations of the British Empire. Especially in the past year or two, the political and economic crises of the British Empire have deepened, and the bad consequences of the British government's policies, which violate the will of the British and Commonwealth peoples, have become increasingly exposed. The situation since the last Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in February last year has prominently demonstrated this fact.

At the last Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, the British Conservative government attempted to impose its aggressive and dangerous policies on the Commonwealth countries. It demanded that the Commonwealth countries support its "new strategic" plans in Europe and Asia—reviving the West German "Defense Force," actively participating in the establishment of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, condoning American aggression and adventurous activities in the Far East, and strengthening the suppression of national independence movements in the Arab East and Southeast Asia. However, Britain's "Cold War" and colonial policies failed to gain the support of all Commonwealth countries. India and Ceylon did not participate in the so-called "defense" issue talks. Facts have proven that pursuing this policy has strengthened the centrifugal forces within the British Empire and weakened its position.

Since the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, peaceful coexistence has become an unstoppable trend in world politics. The policy of strength has suffered a heavy blow. Britain's plan to use the Baghdad Pact to strengthen its control in the Near and Middle East has been powerfully countered by the united forces of the Arab countries. Lloyd's visit to Asia also failed to ease the deep divisions between Britain and many countries in the region regarding support for military blocs. India is independently making increasingly significant contributions to the cause of maintaining peace and promoting international cooperation. The results of the Ceylon parliamentary elections, with the new government headed by Prime Minister Bandaranaike, announced the implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality and demanded that Britain withdraw its military bases in Ceylon. These developments prove that Britain's pursuit of the "position of strength" policy following the United States can only deepen the crisis of the British Empire. The people demand that this policy be revised to adapt to the developing international situation. This demand has formed enormous pressure.

In recent years, the rapid growth of national independence movements and the continuous achievement of new victories have caused the British Empire's old colonial system to encounter an unprecedented crisis. The 74-year colonial occupation of Egypt finally ended, the shackles on the Sudanese people were broken, and military control over Jordan was lost. Britain has waged colonial wars in Malaya for many years, but the Malayan people's will to fight for liberation has become even more determined, and they persist in their struggle. Britain has been forced to recognize the national rights of the Federation of Malaya to implement autonomy before August 1957. Currently, Britain is intensifying its suppression of the Cypriot and Kenyan people's struggles against colonial rule and has rejected the independence demands of the people of Singapore, Aden, and other colonies. But this has not improved Britain's international prestige in the slightest. On the contrary, various signs indicate that the colonial crisis is deepening.

Not only that, but Britain's implementation of the Cold War and colonial policies has also made its economic situation increasingly worse and precarious. According to statistics, Britain's foreign trade deficit last year reached 864 million pounds, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year. The national debt increased to a "terrifying" (Macmillan's words) figure of 27.04 billion pounds; the problem of inflation is very serious. Recently, the British government openly admitted that "the struggle to curb inflation, save the market, and maintain a high standard of living has now reached a critical stage." This serious trend in the British economy cannot but subject the economic and trade relations between the Commonwealth and the sterling area to direct and heavy pressure. The demand for revising the Ottawa Agreement has also been re-proposed within the Commonwealth.

Faced with this dangerous situation, the question of where the British Empire is going has been urgently put on Britain's agenda.

Anyone can see clearly that the key to the problem lies in whether Britain continues to follow the United States in pursuing the bankrupt "policy of strength" and continuing to promote the colonial policy that has already been met with heavy blows, or whether it changes course and takes the broad road of peace, international cooperation, and respect for the self-determination and independent rights of all nations. Taking the latter path means implementing peaceful coexistence, eliminating the threat of war, stopping the arms race, abolishing trade restrictions, developing equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation between countries, and ending the colonial rule that causes oppression, poverty, backwardness, and bloodshed. This is a path that conforms to the national interests of Britain and the interests of world peace, and it is the only viable path.

The results of the contact and talks between the leaders of Britain and the Soviet Union are a new sign of Britain's diplomatic direction. These talks affirmed the principle of peaceful coexistence. Prime Minister Eden announced that Britain's policy is to "seek agreement and promote friendship." He also said, "We will work relentlessly with our friends and allies to establish closer relations between East and West." Recent statements by British leaders indicate that they have some more sober and realistic estimates of the international situation. Eden once said: "Tensions have eased... we are moving away from the Cold War towards a warm peace," and that "in the current hydrogen bomb era, conflict between great powers is unimaginable."

However, such statements and remarks are still a long and complex process away from truly implementing the principles of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation, thereby leading to the resolution of urgent international issues. It cannot be said that Britain has exhausted all its possibilities in this regard. This can be illustrated by the fact that Britain still adopts obstructive tactics together with the United States in solving important international issues such as disarmament, banning atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and restoring German reunification; it can also be proven by the fact that Britain has repeatedly affirmed the aggressive military blocs that are the source of tensions. British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Nutting recently even felt it necessary to declare that "competitive coexistence" is a "new danger" to Britain and spread an atmosphere of distrust towards the Soviet Union. And Nutting is not the only person in Britain interested in making such remarks. Can people believe that this is in line with the policy announced by their prime minister?

Britain's attitude towards national independence movements is even further behind reality. They were forced to make concessions in Egypt, Sudan, Jordan, and even Malaya, but they have not yet abandoned the old colonialist creed that "gunpowder is the best language." They say that Britain has lost too much, and it can no longer give up the Persian Gulf, Cyprus, Aden, Singapore... These are the British Empire's "lines of communication," "strongholds of strength," or "basic factors in defense," and Britain should hold on to them "at all costs." In a word: Britain wants to continue to use terror and military suppression to prevent the further disintegration of the colonial system.

However, as long as one faces the overall situation of the unstoppable national independence movement, no one will believe that any bloody suppression can be effective. Bevan, the leader of the left wing of the British Labour Party, pointed out that the British Empire "built on strength" "cannot be maintained by strength," "now is the time for us to... realize that we are living in a completely different world from before." Such remarks can be heard not only in the Labour Party, but even among some people in the Conservative Party.

As for the serious economic problems, what effective countermeasures will Britain take? Eden recently said: "A more direct threat to the existence of our country is competition in export markets rather than a world war." However, Britain's current financial and export difficulties are inseparable from its Cold War and colonial suppression policies. The heavy burden of military expenditure is a huge pressure on the British economy, weakening Britain's competitiveness in the increasingly fierce struggle for the capitalist market, and subjecting the export trade on which the British economy depends to particularly severe blows from American monopoly capital and the West German and Japanese capital it supports. American monopoly capital is expanding its forces in the British Empire and the sterling area market, acting as the host while the guest is in charge. It should also be pointed out that the trade restriction policy, which is part of the Cold War policy, makes Britain's foreign trade problems even more complicated. Britain will not be able to improve its economic situation as long as it does not break away from the Cold War and overseas military missions.

According to reports, powerful groups in Britain are carrying out a plan to unite and expand the Commonwealth as a "third economic force" to deal with the peaceful competition proposed by the Soviet Union and "the challenge posed by expanding American capital." In any case, the key issue lies in greatly reducing military expenditure, thereby curbing inflation. Therefore, Prime Minister Eden also said on June 23 that in order to cope with the "trade competition" that has "never been seen before," Britain should "make economic expansion easier by reducing the burden of armaments." However, the policy currently implemented by Macmillan is actually a replica of Butler's policy of curbing inflation last autumn. It still attempts not to touch military spending too much, but to get rid of the crisis by tightening the people's belts, implementing hunger exports, that is, restricting consumption and increasing exports. Butler having failed, Macmillan is also unlikely to succeed.

Expanding trade between East and West is another important way out for Britain to get rid of its current economic difficulties. The Soviet leaders proposed to Britain during the London talks a huge purchase figure of 800 million to 1 billion pounds within five years. However, Britain has not yet intended to abandon the infamous embargo policy. The recent practice of citing "exceptional clauses" to relax trade restrictions is far from meeting Britain's objective requirements.

The convening of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is attracting the attention of public opinion. This is because, in the current international situation, constructive diplomatic activities by the Commonwealth can have an extremely beneficial impact on the world situation. In this regard, the main issue is whether Britain, in accordance with the new developments in the situation, resolutely revises the old policy that it has been pursuing in collusion with the United States since the war, and adopts a positive attitude towards issues such as peaceful coexistence, the development of international cooperation and exchanges, and meeting the national aspirations of the colonial people. What kind of page this conference will write in the history of the Commonwealth is a matter of current interest.

    英联邦总理会议和英国的抉择
    胡今
    英国、澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大、南非联邦、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰和南罗得西亚参加的英联邦总理会议，六月二十七日在伦敦举行。这次会议面临着急剧发展的国际局势，和进一步尖锐化的联邦危机。从外国报纸和通讯社的报道可以看出英国政府为国内外一连串严重的问题所苦，希望通过这次会议使英国的处境有所改善，加强英帝国的地位。
    战后国际局势的演变，一直猛烈地冲击和动摇着大英帝国的根基。特别是最近一两年来，英帝国政治、经济方面的危机更加深起来，英国政府采取的违反英国和联邦各国人民意志的政策的恶果日益暴露出来。从去年二月英联邦总理会议到现在一年多的局势，就突出地证明了这一事实。
    在上次英联邦总理会议上，英国保守党政府企图把它的侵略性的危险政策强加于联邦国家身上。它要求联邦国家支持它在欧洲和亚洲的“新战略”计划——复活西德“国防军”，积极参加建立东南亚侵略集团，纵容美国在远东的侵略冒险活动，在阿拉伯东方和东南亚加强镇压民族独立运动。但是，英国这个“冷战”和殖民的政策，并未能得到所有联邦国家的支持，印度和锡兰就没有参加所谓“防务”问题的会谈。事实证明，奉行这个政策，已经加强了英帝国内部的离心力量，削弱了它的地位。
    日内瓦四国首脑会议以来，和平共处成了势不可挡的世界政治潮流。实力政策遭到了沉重的打击。英国企图利用巴格达条约加强它在中近东的控制地位的计划，遭到了阿拉伯国家团结力量的有力反击。劳埃德访问亚洲之行，也未能缓和英国在支持军事集团方面同这地区许多国家的深刻分歧。印度对维护和平和促进国际合作事业独立地作着越来越大的贡献。锡兰议会选举结果，以班达拉奈克总理为首的新政府，宣布执行和平中立政策，并要求英国撤出在锡兰的军事基地。这些事态发展证明，英国追随美国执行“实力地位”政策的结果，只能加深英帝国的危机，人民要求修改这个政策，以适应发展中的国际局势。这种要求形成了巨大的压力。
    近年来民族独立运动急速增长，并不断取得新的胜利，这使得英帝国老大的殖民体制遭遇到了空前的危机。在埃及的七十四年的殖民占领最后结束了，加在苏丹人民身上的枷锁被打断了，对约旦的军事控制丧失了。英国在马来亚进行了多年的殖民战争，但是马来亚人民争取解放的意志却更加高昂，他们坚持不懈地进行斗争。英国不得不被迫承认了马来亚联合邦在1957年8月以前实行自治的民族权利。目前，英国还在加紧镇压塞浦路斯和怯尼亚人民反抗殖民统治的斗争，并且拒绝了新加坡、亚丁等其他殖民地人民的独立要求。但这丝毫没有提高英国的国际威信，反而有各种迹象说明殖民危机正在加深。
    不仅这样，英国执行冷战和殖民政策，也使它的经济状况日趋恶化，岌岌可危。据统计，去年英国对外贸易差额达八亿六千四百万英镑，比前一年增加几近一半，国债增加到二百七十亿四千万英镑的“令人毛骨悚然”（麦克米伦语）的数字；通货膨胀问题非常严重。最近英国政府公开承认：“制止通货膨胀、挽救市场和保持高度生活水平的斗争，现在已经达到了严重的阶段”。英国经济的这种严重趋势，不能不使英联邦和英镑区的经济贸易关系受到直接的沉重压力。修改渥太华协定的要求的呼声，也在联邦内部重新被提出来了。
    面临这种险恶的局面，英帝国往哪里去的问题，就被迫切地提到英国的日程上来了。
    任何人都看得清楚，问题的关键在于：英国究竟是继续追随美国奉行破了产的“实力政策”，继续推行已经碰得头破血流的殖民政策，还是改弦易辙，走和平、国际合作和尊重各民族自决和独立权利的宽广道路。走后一条道路意味着实行和平共处，消除战争威胁，停止军备竞赛，取消贸易限制，发展国际间平等互利的经济合作，终止造成压迫、贫困、落后和流血的殖民统治。这是符合于英国的民族利益和世界和平的利益的道路，也是唯一走得通的道路。
    英苏两国领导人的接触和会谈结果，是英国外交动向的一个新的标志。这次会谈肯定了和平共处的原则。艾登首相宣布英国的政策是“寻求协议，促进友谊”。他并说，“我们将同我们的朋友和盟国一起坚忍不拔地为建立东西方之间更密切的关系而努力”。英国领导人最近的言论，表明他们对于国际局势，有了一些比较清醒的现实的估计。艾登曾表示：“紧张局势已经有了缓和……我们是在离开冷战走向温热的和平”，“在目前的氢弹时代，大国之间的冲突是不可想像的”。
    不过，这样一些声明和言论，距离真正贯彻和平共处和国际合作的原则，从而导致迫切的国际问题的解决，还有很长而复杂的过程。决不能说，在这方面，英国已经用尽了它的一切可能。这从英国在解决裁军、禁止原子武器和氢武器、恢复德国统一等重要国际问题上仍旧同美国一起采取阻挠策略的事实可以找到说明；也可以从英国迄今仍一再肯定成为紧张局势的根源的侵略性军事集团的事实得到证明。英国副外交大臣纳丁最近甚至还觉得有必要声明“竞赛共处”对英国是“新的危险”，并对苏联散布不信任的气氛。而纳丁并不是英国唯一对发表这类言论有兴趣的人。人们难道能够认为这是符合他们的首相所宣布的政策的吗？
    英国对待民族独立运动的态度，落后于现实更远了。他们被迫在埃及、苏丹、约旦以至马来亚作了让步，但他们迄今还没有放弃“枪炮是最好的语言”这个殖民主义者的老信条。他们说，英国失掉的过多了，它再不能放弃波斯湾、塞浦路斯、亚丁、新加坡……，这些是英帝国的“交通线”，“实力据点”，或“防务中的基本因素”，英国应该“不惜任何代价”保住它们。一句话：英国要继续用恐怖和武力镇压来制止殖民制度的进一步瓦解。
    但是，只要正视势不可挡的民族独立运动的整个形势，谁都不会再相信任何血腥镇压能够收到效果。英国工党左翼领袖比万就指出：“靠实力建立起来”的英帝国
  “不能靠实力保住”，“现在是我们应该……认识我们是生活在一个跟以前完全不同的世界里的时候了。”这种言论，不仅在工党中，甚至在保守党的一些人士中，也可以听到了。
    至于对严重的经济问题，英国又将采取什么有效的对策呢？艾登最近说：“对我们国家的存在的更直接的威胁与其说是世界大战，倒不如说是出口市场上的竞争。”但是，英国目前财政和出口方面的困难，是和它的冷战和殖民镇压政策分不开的。沉重的军费负担是对英国经济的巨大压力，削弱了英国在日益尖锐化的资本主义市场争夺战中的竞争能力，使英国经济赖以维持的出口贸易，遭到美国垄断资本及其所支持的西德和日本资本的特别严重的打击，美国垄断资本正在英帝国和英镑区市场里喧宾夺主地扩张势力。这里还应该指出，作为冷战政策的一部分的贸易限制政策，使英国对外贸易的问题更加复杂起来。英国一天不从冷战和海外军事任务中摆脱出来，它就一天不可能改善它的经济状况。
    根据报道，英国有势力的集团正在进行一种策划，企图联合和扩大英联邦作为“第三种经济力量”，对付苏联提出的和平竞赛和“扩张的美国资本所提出的挑战”。不论如何，关键的问题，在于大大地削减军费开支，从而制止通货膨胀。因此，艾登首相六月二十三日也说，为了应付“从来没有见过”的“贸易竞争”，英国应当“通过减轻军备负担而使经济扩展比较容易实现”。可是，现在麦克米伦所执行的政策，实际上是去年秋季巴特勒制止通货膨胀政策的翻版，它仍然企图不怎么去触动军费开支，而从束紧人民腰带、实行饥饿输出，即限制消费，增加出口，来摆脱危机。巴特勒既经失败了，麦克米伦也不可能得到成功。
    扩大东西方贸易是英国摆脱目前经济困境的另一重要出路。苏联领导人在伦敦会谈中就向英国提出了一笔五年内达到八亿到十亿英镑的巨额购货数字。但是，英国目前还没有打算放弃臭名昭彰的禁运政策。最近援引“例外条款”，放宽贸易限制的做法，是远远不能符合英国的客观要求的。
    英联邦总理会议的召开，正在吸引着舆论界的注意力。这是因为，在目前国际局势下，英联邦采取建设性的外交活动，对世界局势能够产生极为有利的影响。而在这方面，主要的问题是英国是否按照形势的新发展而坚决地修改它战后以来一直和美国结伙推行的那个老政策，对和平共处、发展国际合作和交流、满足殖民地人民的民族愿望等问题采取积极的态度。在英联邦的历史上，这次会议写下怎样的一页，这是目前具有兴趣的问题。
