The Brilliant Achievements of the Soviet Union in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
Director of the Department of Technical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yan Jici

The Soviet Union's exhibition of scientific and technological achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy opened on June 15 at the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing. This is an important initiative by the Soviet people and the Soviet government to help us understand and master atomic energy science and technology. The Chinese people, who are actively building a socialist society, are all excited about this and sincerely thank the Soviet Union for this sincere and selfless assistance.

As everyone knows, the world's first atomic power station was built in the Soviet Union as early as June 27, 1954. This power station uses a uranium-graphite reactor with water as a coolant, and has a power generation capacity of 5,000 kilowatts. It has been working smoothly for nearly two years without any accidents. The Soviet Union is continuing to build atomic power stations with capacities of 50,000, 100,000, and even 400,000 kilowatts. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will build atomic power stations with a capacity of 2 million to 2.5 million kilowatts. The realization of this grand plan will be another great victory for mankind's peaceful use of atomic energy.

Using atomic energy to generate electricity consumes very little fuel, does not require air to assist combustion, and has other advantages. Therefore, the use of atomic energy as other power devices is also rapidly developing in the Soviet Union. The world's first atomic icebreaker has been designed and construction has begun in the Soviet Union. This atomic icebreaker will have a displacement of 16,000 tons, and its main engine will be 44,000 horsepower. Atomic locomotives and other means of transportation using atomic energy fuel will continue to appear under the creation of Soviet scientists and engineers, and mankind's long-imagined interstellar travel may also become a reality.

Atomic energy can be used to transform nature. In 1949, the Soviet Union used atomic energy to blast open the Upper Gair watershed, diverting the Yenisei River in Siberia into the Ob River, providing abundant water resources for the vast Turkestan desert, turning the desert into fertile fields, and completely changing the economic landscape of the region.

The application of radioactive isotopes is another broad field for the peaceful use of atomic energy. Whether in industry, agriculture, scientific research, or medicine, radioactive isotopes provide powerful new methods and tools. The application of isotopes has achieved great and even previously unattainable achievements. Examples from a large number of scientific reports can be used to illustrate the contributions of Soviet scientists in this area. By using radioactive phosphorus to investigate the nutrient absorption of cotton, it was discovered that foliar topdressing can increase cotton production by 12%. Radioactive cobalt is widely used in industry to inspect the parts of large machinery to ensure the quality of the machinery. The application of radioactive isotopes greatly facilitates the study of internal diffusion phenomena in metals and alloys and the study of alloy structure. Many industrial production processes can be automatically adjusted using radioactive isotopes. Radioactive cobalt can be used to treat cancer, radioactive iodine can be used to diagnose and treat thyroid diseases, and radioactive sodium and phosphorus can be used to study blood circulation phenomena.

In addition to the method of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter atomic nuclei to obtain atomic energy, there is another method, which is to combine light atomic nuclei to cause nuclear reactions. To cause light atomic nuclei to combine and react, the atomic nuclei undergoing the reaction must have a very high speed. Therefore, light atomic nuclear reactions are usually carried out at extremely high temperatures. This reaction is called a thermonuclear reaction. The energy produced by thermonuclear reactions is greater than the former method, and the use of light atomic nuclei such as heavy hydrogen as raw materials for atomic energy is of course much more abundant than resources such as uranium and thorium. Therefore, studying how to increase the temperature of matter to extremely high levels under control to produce thermonuclear reactions is of great significance. Soviet scientists have made research achievements in this area far ahead of British and American scientists, and they are working hard to produce controllable thermonuclear reactions.

The socialist country of the Soviet Union has achieved brilliant achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy through its own efforts. However, the Soviet Union does not keep these experiences secret and hidden, but is willing to contribute these achievements to benefit all mankind.

On January 17, 1955, the Soviet Council of Ministers decided to provide scientific, technical, and industrial assistance to five countries, including China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic, to establish scientific experimental centers to develop research on nuclear physics and the peaceful uses of atomic energy. In April 1955, the Soviet Union signed agreements with the above-mentioned five countries on this issue.

The Soviet government is constantly expanding the scope of the countries it can help. Currently, Hungary and Bulgaria have received the same assistance from the Soviet Union as mentioned above; the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have signed an agreement on cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy; the Soviet Union will also help Egypt establish a nuclear physics research institute. From this, it can be imagined that, with the close cooperation of peace-loving countries headed by the Soviet Union, the achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy will truly become one of the most valuable assets of all mankind, and it will no longer be monopolized by imperialist atomic maniacs.

In July 1955, the Soviet Union convened a conference on scientific and technical issues related to the peaceful use of atomic energy, inviting twenty-three countries to participate. In August of the same year, Soviet scientists also participated in the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva. At these two conferences, outstanding Soviet scientists introduced their achievements in this area in detail. Soviet scientists' outstanding achievements in this area have received high praise internationally. A British scientist wrote after visiting the "Soviet Union's Exhibition of Scientific and Technological Achievements in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy" exhibited in Geneva: "This exhibition shows the future, which will appear to the world like the dawn after the night. Let the Russian people's outstanding exhibition help the coming of this bright day!"

In March this year, the Soviet Union, China, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and other countries signed an agreement on the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow. The Soviet government transferred all the equipment and buildings of the Institute of Nuclear Problems of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Electronic Physics of the Soviet Union to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, so that scientists from various countries could start working under well-equipped conditions from the beginning, greatly promoting the rapid development of international scientific cooperation.

The Soviet government and Soviet scientists are particularly concerned about China's research and application of the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet government is helping China build experimental atomic piles and basic particle accelerators in accordance with the provisions of last year's agreement, and is helping China train specialized research cadres and technicians. At the end of last year, in view of the fact that Chinese scientists were unable to attend the Geneva International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy due to the deliberate obstruction of US imperialism, the Soviet government specially sent a delegation of Soviet scientists to China to convey the content and achievements of this conference to the Chinese people. Now, the Soviet government has come to our country from afar to hold an exhibition of scientific and technological achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, using vivid and practical materials to help us understand, understand, and master the most advanced scientific and technological achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

This exhibition embodies an extremely lofty goal: to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes on the basis of international cooperation to promote the development of human civilization.

This exhibition also embodies the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the desire and determination of the people of the two countries to love and defend peace.

We firmly believe that with the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union, our scientists, engineers, and workers will be able to quickly master the science and technology of the peaceful use of atomic energy. With the help and cooperation of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people will join hands with peace-loving people all over the world to fight unremittingly against atomic war, the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and for the promotion of the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    苏联和平利用原子能的辉煌成就
    中国科学院技术科学学部主任　严济慈
    苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会六月十五日在北京的苏联展览馆揭幕。这是苏联人民和苏联政府帮助我们认识和掌握原子能科学技术的一个重要创举。正在积极建设着社会主义社会的中国人民对此莫不表示兴奋，并且衷心感谢苏联这种诚挚无私的帮助。
    大家都知道，世界上第一座原子能发电站早于1954年6月27日在苏联建成。这座发电站应用了以水为冷却剂的铀、石墨反应堆，发电量是五千瓩，它已经顺利地工作了将近二年，没有出过任何事故。苏联正在继续不断地兴建五万、十万以至四十万瓩的原子能发电站。在第六个五年计划里，苏联兴建的原子能发电站的功率达二百万至二百五十万瓩。这一宏伟计划的实现，将是人类和平利用原子能事业的又一伟大胜利。
    利用原子能发电，消耗燃料极少，不需要用空气来助燃，另外还有其他种种有利条件。因此原子能用作其他动力装置的工作也正在苏联迅速开展着。世界上第一艘原子能破冰船已经在苏联设计完毕并且开始建造。这艘原子破冰船的排水量将是一万六千吨，它的主发动机是四万四千匹马力。原子能机车以及其他使用原子能燃料的运输工具在苏联科学家和工程师的创造下将会继续出现，而人类长期所幻想的星际航行也有可能成为现实。
    原子能可以用来改造大自然。苏联在1949年利用原子能炸开了上盖尔分水岭，将西伯利亚的叶尼塞河引入鄂毕河，使广大的土耳其斯坦沙漠获得了充沛的水源，沙漠变成良田，完全改变了这个地区的经济面貌。
    放射性同位素的应用是和平利用原子能的另一广大领域。不论在工业、农业、科学研究、医学中，放射性同位素都提供了强有力的新方法和工具。同位素的应用已经取得了巨大的甚至以前所无法取得的成就。可以从大量的科学报道中举出这样一些例子来说明苏联科学家们在这方面的贡献。由于利用放射性磷考察棉花吸取营养的情况，发现了根外追肥的方法可以使棉产量增加12％。工业上普遍应用放射性钴来检查大型机械的部件以保证机械的质量。放射性同位素的应用大大地便利了金属和合金内部扩散现象的研究和合金结构的研究。许多工业生产过程可以用放射性同位素进行自动调节。利用放射性钴可以治疗癌，利用放射性錪可以诊断和治疗甲状腺的病症，利用放射性钠和磷可以研究血液循环的现象。
    获得原子能的方法除了使重原子核分裂变成较轻的原子核的方法外，还有另一种方法，就是使轻原子核结合而起核反应的方法。要使轻原子核结合而起反应，必须使进行反应的原子核具有很大的速度。因此轻原子核反应通常在极高温度下进行，这种反应叫做热核反应。由热核反应所产生的能量要比前一种方法大，而用轻原子核如重氢作为原子能的原料当然又比铀、钍这些资源更是丰富得多。因此，研究如何能把物质在控制下提高到极高的温度以产生热核反应就具有极大的意义了。苏联科学家在这方面已经取得的研究成绩远在英、美科学家的前面，他们正在为产生可以控制的热核反应而努力。
    社会主义国家的苏联依靠自己的努力在原子能和平利用方面取得了辉煌的成就。但是苏联并不把这些经验保守和密藏起来，而愿意把这些成就贡献出来，为全人类造福。
    1955年1月17日苏联部长会议决定给予中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和德意志民主共和国等五个国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助来建立科学实验中心，以发展对核子物理学和原子能的和平用途方面的研究。1955年4月，苏联同上述五个国家就这个问题签订了协定。
    苏联政府正在不断扩大它所能够帮助的国家的范围。目前，匈牙利和保加利亚已经得到苏联的如上所述的同样的帮助；苏联和南斯拉夫已经签订了关于和平利用原子能方面进行合作的协议；苏联也将帮助埃及建立核子物理研究所。由此可以想见，在以苏联为首的爱好和平各国的密切配合下，和平利用原子能的成就，真正成为全人类最宝贵的财富之一，它已决不再被帝国主义原子狂人们所垄断了。
    1955年7月苏联召开了一个邀请二十三个国家参加的和平利用原子能科学技术问题会议。同年八月，苏联科学家又参加了日内瓦和平利用原子能的国际会议。在这两个会议上，苏联优秀的科学家们详尽地介绍了自己在这一方面的成就。苏联科学家在这方面的卓越成就得到国际间很高的评价。一位英国的科学家在参观了在日内瓦展出的“苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会”后这样写道：“这个展览会展示了未来，它将如黑夜之后的天明一样出现于世界。让俄国人民成绩卓越的展览帮助这明朗的天的来临！”
    今年三月在莫斯科，苏、中、阿、保、匈、德、朝、蒙、波、罗、捷等国签订了关于成立联合核子研究所的协定。苏联政府把苏联科学院核子问题研究所和苏联电子物理研究所的一切设备和建筑移交给联合核子研究所，使得各国科学家在一开始就能够在有完善设备的条件下进行工作，大大促进了国际科学合作的迅速开展。
    苏联政府和苏联科学家们对我国和平利用原子能的研究和应用更是特别关怀的。苏联政府正按照去年协定的规定，帮助我国建造实验性原子堆和基本粒子加速器，正在帮助我国培养专门的研究干部和技术人员。去年年底，苏联政府鉴于中国科学家由于美帝国主义的蓄意阻挠未能出席日内瓦和平利用原子能国际会议，特地派遣了苏联科学家访华代表团来向我国人民传达这次会议的内容和成就。现在，苏联政府又不远千里地来我国举办和平利用原子能科学技术展览会，用生动的实际材料来帮助我们认识、了解和掌握和平利用原子能的最先进的科学技术成就。
    这个展览会体现着一个极崇高的目标：在国际合作的基础上，把原子能用于和平的目的，以促进人类文明的发展。
    这个展览会也体现着中苏两国间的伟大友谊以及两国人民热爱和平的愿望和保卫和平的决心。
    我们深信，我国的科学家、工程师和工人们，在苏联这种真诚的帮助下，一定能够迅速掌握和平利用原子能的科学技术。中国人民在苏联的帮助和合作下，将同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为反对原子战争、禁止使用原子武器和氢武器、为促进和平利用原子能而奋斗不懈。
