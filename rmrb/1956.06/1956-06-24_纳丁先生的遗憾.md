Mr. Nutting's Regret

"I regret to say that Egypt has many misunderstandings about our goals and intentions." On the 16th, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nutting, spent a seemingly unhappy weekend in Lancashire, and he expressed this "regret" in a speech.

A few days before Nutting issued this "regret," the last British flag on the barracks in the Suez Canal Zone was lowered in the afterglow of the setting sun, and the last British soldier silently left Egypt. Brigadier General John Lasseter, commander of the British forces in Port Said, stepped onto a British tank landing craft and, standing on the deck, stared at the bare flagpole of the former British naval headquarters in Port Said, and said listlessly: "This is an unpleasant thing for us."

Compared to Nutting, John Lasseter was much more frank. He at least did not try to portray this result, which the Egyptian people had finally won through decades of bloodshed and sacrifice, as a symbol of British friendship towards Egypt.

Can it really be said that Egypt has many misunderstandings about the goals and intentions of the British colonialists?

In fact, when the British naval fleet, led by Admiral Seymour, launched a massive bombardment and massacre of Alexandria seventy-four years ago, the roar of the guns made the Egyptian people see clearly these intentions and purposes.

Nutting emphasized that there were no real disputes between the British colonialists and Egypt, which had long been oppressed and enslaved by British colonialism and is still often attacked and intimidated by British imperialists. However, the bloody historical facts have made the Egyptian people deeply remember what kind of relationship exists between imperialist plunderers and oppressors and the oppressed and plundered. Is it not precisely this relationship that the Egyptian people have been striving to change through decades of bloody struggle? Is this not a "real dispute"? Is it not the result of the development of this dispute that British troops were finally forced to withdraw from Egypt? Mr. Nutting pretends to be very concerned about the safety of Egypt and the people of the Middle East. It is said that the Baghdad Pact is the "most reliable barrier for Middle Eastern countries to resist foreign aggression," and with it, the people of the Middle East can sleep much more peacefully.

However, the Egyptian people know where the threat to them comes from. They have also seen how Britain, on strategic grounds, rejected the national demands of the people of Aden. Nor will they feel complacent about the atrocities of the British army on the island of Cyprus, which is close at hand. Egypt believes that the purpose of the Baghdad Pact is to maintain colonialist forces in the Arab region. There are enough facts to support this argument, and no facts to support Nutting.

The problem is that the era of colonialism has passed, and the development of the situation makes those who have not yet abandoned colonial ideas feel very uncomfortable. But the situation is still developing forward, whether those great gentlemen are happy or not.

These days, Egypt is celebrating nationwide. Joyful songs are floating over the land of Egypt. On the Nile River under the moonlight, people are joyfully racing boats. Colorful fireworks streak across the sky. The victorious flag of Egypt is flying on the flagpole of the former British barracks. The people of Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Aswan... are all immersed in the joyful sea of celebrating Egypt's independence. At this moment, from some corners of the world, come the "regretful" and "unpleasant" sighs and complaints of some people, reminding us that colonialism has not died, and we must be careful to guard against wolves in sheep's clothing.

Rejoice! Children of the Nile!
Be vigilant! Ancient kingdom of the pyramids!

### 纳丁先生的遗憾

    纳丁先生的遗憾
    “我遗憾地说，埃及对我们的目标和意图有许多误解。”十六日，英国外交副大臣纳丁先生在兰开夏度过了一个似乎并不开心的周末，他在演说中表达了这种“遗憾”。
    在纳丁发出这种“遗憾”之声的前几天，苏彝士运河区兵营上的最后一面英国旗，在落日余晖的照射下降落了，最后一个英国兵默默地离开了埃及。塞得港英军司令约翰·拉西准将踏上英国坦克登陆艇后，站在甲板上凝视着塞得港原英国海军司令部光秃秃的旗杆，没精打采地说：“这对于我们是一件不愉快的事。”
    比起纳丁来，约翰·拉西是坦率得多了。他至少没有试图把埃及人民几十年流血牺牲而终于争得的这一结果描绘成似乎是英国对埃及友好的标志。
    能够说埃及对英国殖民者的目标和意图真的有许多误解吗？
    其实，当七十四年前英国海军舰队在西摩大将率领下，向亚历山大港展开大轰击大屠杀开始，枪炮的轰鸣就使埃及人民看清楚这种意图和目的了。
    纳丁强调说，在英国殖民者和长期受英国殖民主义压迫和奴役、而且现在还常常受到英国的帝国主义分子攻击和恫吓的埃及之间本没有任何真正的争端。可是，血淋淋的历史事实已使埃及人民深记不忘帝国主义掠夺者、压迫者和被压迫、被掠夺者的关系是一种什么关系。埃及人民几十年来流血斗争，渴求改变的不正是这种关系？这难道不是“真正的争端”？英国军队终于被迫撤离埃及，不正是这一争端发展的结果吗？纳丁先生装作非常关心埃及和中东各国人民的安全。据说，巴格达条约就是“中东国家抗拒外来侵略的最可靠的屏障”，有了它，中东各国人民睡眠可以安逸得多了。
    然而，埃及人民知道对他们的威胁来自何方。他们也看到英国如何以战略的理由拒绝了亚丁人民的民族要求。他们更不会对英国军队在近在门前的塞浦路斯岛上的暴行感到泰然。埃及认为巴格达条约的目的是要保持在阿拉伯地区的殖民主义势力。有足够多的事实支持这一论断，而还没有任何事实足以为纳丁撑腰。
    问题在于，殖民主义的时代已经过去，形势的发展使得还没有放弃殖民观念的人感到很不舒服。可是形势还是向前发展，不管那些大人先生们高兴不高兴。
    这几天，埃及正在举国欢腾，欢乐的歌声飘荡在埃及的大地，月下的尼罗河上人们兴高采烈地赛舟，彩色缤纷的焰火划空而过，埃及胜利的旗帜在原来的英军兵营的旗杆上飘扬，开罗、亚历山大港、塞得港、阿斯旺……的人们都浸沉在庆祝埃及独立的欢乐的海里。正当这个时候，从世界的某些角落传来了某些人的“遗憾”和“不愉快”的叹息和抱怨，它提醒人们，殖民主义还没有死亡，要小心谨防披上了羊皮的狼。
    欢笑吧！尼罗河的儿女！
    警惕啊！金字塔的古国！
