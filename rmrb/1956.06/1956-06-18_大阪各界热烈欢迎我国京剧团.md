Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, 16th. The Chinese Peking Opera Delegation received a warm welcome from all circles in Osaka after arriving.

Yesterday noon, the Osaka Prefectural Government, the Osaka Municipal Government, and the "Asahi Shimbun" jointly held a reception.

Osaka Prefectural Vice Governor Sonosuke Yamamura, representing the Osaka Prefectural Governor, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting, saying: Your excellent art has deeply moved the audience and received enthusiastic praise. He paid sincere respect to the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation, which is committed to Japan-China friendship and cultural exchange.

In the afternoon of the same day, the "Peking Opera Delegation Welcome Committee," composed of various circles in Osaka, also held a reception.

At the reception, Kiyomi Tamaki of the Welcome Committee said: In the eyes of the Japanese people, the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation is both a cultural envoy and a peace envoy. He said: China's national culture has achieved brilliant achievements on the basis of people's democracy; on the contrary, Japan's national art is now seriously affected by decadent culture such as American movies and jazz music, and is gradually losing its inherent national character, which is a very regrettable thing. He said that the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation's visit to Japan not only gave a correct direction to the future of Japanese national art, but also made a great contribution to promoting cultural exchange between Japan and China and restoring diplomatic relations.

Delegation leader Mei Lanfang gave a reply speech at the meeting, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome from all circles in Osaka, and wishing for the further prosperity of Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges and the deeper friendship between the people of China and Japan.

    大阪各界热烈欢迎我国京剧团
    据新华社大阪16日电　中国京剧代表团到大阪后受到各界热烈的欢迎。
    昨天中午，大阪府政府、大阪市政府和“朝日新闻”社联合举行了欢迎会。
    大阪府副知事山村庄之助代表大阪府知事在会上致欢迎词说：你们优秀的艺术，使观众深受感动，并且受到观众热烈的赞扬。他向正在致力于日中友好和文化交流的中国京剧代表团致以衷心的敬意。
    当天下午，大阪各界组成的“京剧代表团欢迎委员会”又举行了欢迎会。
    在欢迎会上，欢迎委员会的田万清臣说：中国京剧代表团在日本人民看来是文化使节也是和平使节。他说：中国的民族文化在人民民主主义的基础上获得了辉煌的成就；相反地，现在日本的民族艺术却严重地受到美国电影和爵士音乐等颓废文化的影响，渐渐地失去它的固有的民族性，这是一件非常令人遗憾的事情。他说，中国京剧代表团来日本访问，不仅对日本民族艺术的将来给予了正确的方向，而且对于促进日中两国的文化交流和恢复邦交都有很大的贡献。
    梅兰芳团长在会上致答词，对大阪各界的盛情欢迎表示感谢，并祝中日文化交流更加繁荣，祝中日两国人民的友谊更加深厚。
