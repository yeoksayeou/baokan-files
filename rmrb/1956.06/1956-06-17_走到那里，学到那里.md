Last winter, the community school in Nanchi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, Xinjiang County, Shanxi Province, was doing very well. All 139 illiterate people in the village participated in the study, and their academic performance was also very good.

However, after the Nanchi Village Agricultural Cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative in February of this year, because the cadres were very busy with their work, they not only did not study themselves, but also did not care about the work of the community school. The cooperative's director said to the volunteer teachers: "The transformation from a lower-level cooperative to an advanced cooperative is a major event, and we must make a good impression. You can mess around with the people's school." At the same time, because the study and production time were not unified at the beginning of spring production, class time was often squeezed out by production. In addition, because the cooperative's operation and management had not yet been put on the right track at that time, the members had to evaluate and record work points every night, often until after 10 o'clock, which made the class time very late. Some students were too tired and did not come to class. Soon, the number of students decreased from forty-seven to twenty-two. The members said: "The literacy work in our village is still like an uncle holding a lantern for his nephew – still the same old way, always ending with a bang and fizzling out." At this time, the cadres also realized that if this continued, the literacy task would not be completed on schedule. Therefore, the Party branch convened a meeting of cadres from all systems, and everyone inspected the work of the people's school. The Party branch secretary and the cooperative director both criticized their bias of neglecting literacy work.

Later, after research by the production team leaders and work recorders, the methods of quota management, field work evaluation, and using blackboards to assign tasks were adopted to solve the problem of study time every night. Every night, the group leaders and work recorders recorded work points in another place (the group leaders and work recorders were all literate). After the students started studying for an hour and a half at eight o'clock, the work recorders announced the members' work points and wrote down the members' tasks for tomorrow on a small blackboard, so that the members could see what work they would do tomorrow. This solved the problem of reporting accounts, recording work points, and assigning tasks every night, and guaranteed study time. As a result, the students who dropped out of school midway returned to school.

The community school began to get on the right track, and the students' learning enthusiasm gradually stabilized. Who knew that after five or six days of classes, the county sent instructions requiring the cooperative to send people to the Fenhui water conservancy construction site to dig canals. A total of twenty-four people went, half of whom were illiterate or semi-literate. How could these people be encouraged to continue learning? The volunteer teachers and cadres conducted research and put forward the slogan "Go where you are, learn where you are," and divided the illiterate and semi-literate people into four groups, selected group leaders and deputy group leaders, and equipped them with volunteer teachers and tutors. Everyone brought their books and slates; the volunteer teachers brought teaching aids, and they studied every day during the noon break from 12:00 to 1:30. Some groups also reviewed in the evening. As a result, in just five days, each of the twelve illiterate students learned 50 to 60 new characters, some even learned 70 new characters, and could read, speak, and write them.

After the water conservancy project task was completed, the students returned to their village and continued to persist in classroom learning as usual. But in less than ten days, the task of greening Jiwang Mountain came again. So the school moved the classroom to Jiwang Mountain and continued to insist on learning.

Beginning in mid-April, production tasks became even more intense, with both cotton planting and wheat weeding. At this time, the school reduced the evening class time and conducted field reviews. Learning groups were organized according to production organization, and each group was equipped with a volunteer teacher or tutor.

Their field review time was twice a day, once for reading the newspaper and once for reviewing cultural lessons, each time for half an hour. At first, the students were not accustomed to studying in the fields, so the cooperative compiled a jingle: "When going to the field, carry the hoe on your shoulder, carry the book on your body..." to urge the students to bring their books to the field. In addition to the students participating in community school learning and conducting field reviews, there were also sixty-three people who were being taught individually outside the school, forty-two of whom could participate in field labor and also conduct field reviews. The women who could not go to the fields were all tutored by the tutors in the evenings.

Now, Nanchi Village is full of a new atmosphere of learning culture, just as the members sing: "The masses teach the masses, neighbors teach neighbors, women who can read teach men, men who can read teach women, there is no idle person in the literacy village."

    走到那里，学到那里
    晋俭
    去年冬天，山西省新绛县南池村农业生产合作社的社校办得很好，全村139名文盲都参加了学习，学习成绩也很好。
    但是，南池村农业社在今年二月转入高级社以后，因为干部们工作很忙，不但自己不学习，连社校的工作也不管了。社长对义务教员说：“低级社转成高级社是个大事情，一定要搞个样子，民校的事情你们闹吧。”同时，因为春季生产开始的时候，学习和生产的时间没有统一的安排，常常被生产挤掉了上课的时间。另外，因为那时候合作社的经营管理还没有走上正轨，每天黑夜社员都要评分记工，总要弄到十点多钟，使上课时间拖得很晚。有些学员因为太累，就不来上课了。不久，学员由四十七人减少到二十二人。社员们说：咱村的扫盲工作，还是外甥打灯笼——照舅（旧），年年落个虎头蛇尾。干部们这时候也看到，照这样下去，扫盲任务就没有办法按期完成了。于是党支部召开了各系统干部的会议，大家对民校工作进行了检查，党支部书记和社长都检讨了忽视扫盲工作的偏向。
    后来，又经过生产队长、记工员们的研究，采取了定额管理、地头评工、利用黑板派活的办法，解决了每天晚上的学习时间问题。每天晚上由小组长和记工员在另一个地方记工（小组长和记工员都是非文盲），学员们八点钟开始学习一个半钟头以后，由记工员宣布社员的工分，同时把明天社员的活计写在小黑板上，社员一看就知道明天干什么活。这样就解决了每天晚上报账、记工和派活的问题，保证了学习时间。于是中途退学的学员都复学了。
    社校开始走上了正轨，学员们的学习情绪也逐渐安定下来。谁知道上了五、六天课，县上来了指示，要合作社派人到汾浍水利工地上去开渠。一共去了二十四人，文盲、半文盲就占了一半。怎么使这些人也坚持学习呢？义务教员和干部们进行了研究，提出“走到那里，学到那里”的口号，把文盲、半文盲编了四个小组，选出了正副组长，配备了义务教员和辅导员。大家带上了书本、石板；义务教员带上了教具，每天在中午十二时到一时半的休息时间内学习。有的小组在晚上还进行复习。结果，仅仅在五天当中，十二个文盲学员就每人认识了五十到六十个生字，有的还认识了七十个生字，并且会读，会讲，会写。
    水利工程任务完成以后，学员们仍然回到本村照常坚持着课堂学习。可是没有过了十天，绿化稷王山的任务又来了。于是学校又把课堂搬上了稷王山，仍然坚持了学习。
    四月中旬开始，生产任务更加紧张，又种棉，又锄麦。这时候，学校就减少晚上上课的时间，进行田间复习，按生产组织编了学习组，每组都配备了义务教员或辅导员。
    他们在田间复习的时间，每天两次，一次读报，一次复习文化课，每次半个钟头。开始，学员们没有在田间学习的习惯，社里就编了“上地时，锄头肩上扛，书本身上装，……”的顺口溜，督促学员带书本上地。除了参加社校学习的学员进行田间复习外，还有在校外包教的六十三人，其中有四十二人能参加田间劳动，也进行田间复习。另外一些不能上地的妇女，都由辅导员利用晚上的时间进行包教。
    现在南池村处处是学习文化的新气象，正如社员们所唱的：“群教群，邻教邻，女人识字教男人，男人识字教女人，扫盲村里没闲人。”
