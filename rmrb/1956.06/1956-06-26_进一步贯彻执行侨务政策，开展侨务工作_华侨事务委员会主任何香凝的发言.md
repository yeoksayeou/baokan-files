    Further Implement Overseas Chinese Affairs Policies and Carry Out Overseas Chinese Affairs Work
    ——Speech by He Xiangning, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
    I completely agree with Deputy Prime Minister Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives, Deputy Chairman Peng Zhen's work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the reports and speeches of Deputy Prime Ministers Chen Yun, Li Fuchun, and Deng Zihui. Our country's 1955 final accounts and 1956 budget not only vividly reflect the abundance and strengthening of our country's construction strength, the desire of our people to carry out peaceful construction, and the state's concern for the people's lives, but also demonstrate the balance of state revenue and expenditure, and the possibility of providing economic assistance to friendly countries on the basis of friendly cooperation. All of this will not only excite and encourage the domestic people, but also make overseas Chinese even more patriotic and united.
    Overseas Chinese have made certain contributions in supporting the construction of the motherland and promoting friendly relations between the motherland and Southeast Asian countries.
    Overseas Chinese tend towards the motherland, and many British and American journalists who have visited Southeast Asia have had to admit that "they turn like a magnet's attraction." This is inseparable from the development of the motherland and the improvement of its international status.
    Over the past year, the friendly relations between our country and Southeast Asian countries have continued to improve, and the traditional friendship between overseas Chinese and the people of their countries of residence has further developed. Overseas Chinese support the socialist construction of the motherland, actively assist the people of their countries of residence in developing their local national economies, and have made certain contributions to promoting friendly relations between the motherland and Southeast Asian countries.
    Domestically, thanks to the strong support and active efforts of party and government leading organs, relevant departments, and overseas Chinese affairs workers in various regions, overseas Chinese affairs work has also achieved some results. In February 1955, the State Council promulgated the "Order on Implementing the Policy of Protecting Overseas Remittances," which has been supported by overseas Chinese and their families in areas where it has been well implemented. In August of the same year, Chairman Mao Zedong promulgated the "Regulations on Overseas Chinese Applying to Use State-Owned Barren Mountains and Wasteland," which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of returned overseas Chinese and their families to participate in national construction. The grain supply for overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese has also been appropriately taken care of in accordance with the special circumstances of overseas Chinese families. On the basis of opposing conservatism, overseas Chinese affairs work has also overcome some of the past hesitations. In the great high tide of socialist construction and socialist transformation, more than 90% of overseas Chinese families have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and about 50% have transferred to advanced cooperatives. A large number of labor models and advanced workers have emerged from among returned overseas Chinese and their families. The vast majority of returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have also actively accepted socialist transformation.
    These have been supported by overseas Chinese abroad, promoting their patriotism and unity. The enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to return to China to invest and participate in the construction of the motherland has been further enhanced. Last year, overseas Chinese investment in China increased by 50% compared to the past (1951 to 1954), and overseas remittances across the country also increased. The number of overseas Chinese returning to China for sightseeing has increased significantly compared to last year.
    Arrange their voluntary labor according to the specific circumstances and expertise of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese.
    However, as our work further develops, in the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in overseas Chinese areas, some areas have produced crude and impetuous styles, ignoring some of the special circumstances of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese. Many plans in the Twelve-Year Agricultural Development Program, which were originally to be completed in twelve years, are now planned to be completed in three or four years, and therefore some problems have also emerged.
    Overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese are willing to participate in labor, but the main labor force of many overseas Chinese households is abroad, and the labor force in China is generally weaker. We have not clearly estimated their labor situation and characteristics, nor have we paid attention to giving play to their labor expertise and properly arranging them. We have failed to treat them differently, but instead assigned them labor that they are not capable of, and even ignored the family labor of a small number of widowed, orphaned, lonely, old, weak, sick, and disabled overseas Chinese families lacking labor, one-sidedly emphasizing labor attendance rates. Many overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese, although not competent to engage in staple food production, are able or good at producing cash crops and sideline production. After some overseas Chinese area primary agricultural cooperatives turned into advanced cooperatives, due to concentrating on increasing grain production, there was a tendency to force the cancellation of sideline occupations and the conversion to grain planting. For example, in Kaiping, Guangdong, garlic was removed; in Chaoyang, mandarin orange trees were cut down to grow grain; and in Daliang, Shunde, a large number of mulberry trees were cut down, resulting in a large waste of silkworm cocoons, which are significant examples. As a result, the income of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese decreased. Some overseas Chinese area cooperatives invested too much in production and non-production, and added the investment burden to overseas Chinese families with remittances. For example, in Quanzhou, Fujian, a cooperative mobilized overseas Chinese to invest two thousand yuan, but it was used to run a club and spent. This has caused the burden on overseas Chinese family members to be too heavy, increasing their ideological concerns.
    Under the above circumstances, overseas Chinese families have become uneasy about living in the countryside, and some have gone abroad. In March and April of this year, overseas remittances have decreased compared to the same period last year, which must be taken seriously and resolved. For these problems, the central and local governments have taken some measures in a timely manner. I will only explain some of the problems here:
    We believe that some overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese are not yet accustomed to the operation of heavy agricultural labor and cannot demand them to be too high according to the level of ordinary domestic farmers. We need to adopt long-term patient education methods to help them learn agricultural labor techniques. At the same time, we must affirm that doing housework, raising pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks are also labor. Guangdong Province stipulates that for overseas Chinese families who rely on overseas remittances for a living and are unwilling to participate in agricultural labor, they should also be allowed not to participate in labor, not to be assigned work, and not to stipulate their attendance rate; if they voluntarily participate, they should be welcomed, and they can do whatever they want, and do as much as they can; for overseas Chinese families who partially rely on overseas remittances for a living, are weak, and old, the cooperatives should take the initiative to take care of them, assign them work suitable for their physical conditions and labor capacity, or let them choose their own types of work and report their working hours. This regulation is very necessary. Therefore, it is hoped that the governments at all levels in overseas Chinese areas will formulate production plans in a realistic manner according to what overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese are capable of and can best give play to their enthusiasm, and properly arrange the voluntary labor of each person.
    In areas with a large number of returned overseas Chinese and their families, some cooperative members are mostly or entirely overseas Chinese families, with a weak labor force and are not competent to cultivate staple food. We should resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and frugally, which propose to "open up production avenues, develop sideline production, and operate diverse economies." By doing so, the production of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese can also be used as a production unit (team or group) during the merger of cooperatives, and overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese can also engage in production in various different positions, increasing wealth for the country, increasing income for themselves, and ensuring that their lives can be gradually improved and raised.
    In order to assign work suitable for the ability of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese according to their characteristics and expertise, overseas Chinese families who are not accustomed to agricultural labor can be assigned to raise livestock and poultry (such as pigs, sheep, cattle, chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys), raise bees, plant castor beans, raise castor silkworms, plant mulberry, plant tea, and oil crops. Or organize them to engage in handicrafts such as knitting and embroidery, as well as participate in cultural, educational, and health work in the cooperative, so that these overseas Chinese families who are willing to work can all get a reasonable division of labor and each get their place.
    Cooperatives that plant cash crops and engage in sideline production can be allowed to reduce or even exempt staple food production tasks. After cash crops are included in the local production plan, the price policy must be rationally controlled to truly achieve rewarding labor. Overseas Chinese families engaged in cash crops should also be supplied with grain as needed to encourage their enthusiasm for production.
    It is hoped that overseas Chinese will actively return to China to invest in reclamation undertakings and contribute their expertise in operating tropical cash crops to the motherland.
    Our country has a large population and abundant human resources, and is rich in agricultural products and special economic crops in cold, temperate, and tropical zones, which will help socialist construction and foreign trade. Therefore, we have very superior conditions in these aspects. Imperialist countries plunder the economic crop raw materials of colonial and dependent countries to create industrial products, dump them abroad, and exploit the people of the colonies, making their lives increasingly difficult. We are socialist, and we must make good use of our superior conditions, exert a greater role, create more superior conditions, and make greater contributions to the people of the world. In our country's Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan, and southern Guizhou regions, rubber, coffee, sugar cane, sisal hemp, castor beans, coconuts, citronella, quinine, tobacco, camphor, cocoa, betel nut, pepper, pineapple, olives, citrus, oranges, bananas, lychees, longan, star fruit, pomelos, oil palm, sea island cotton, derris, mulberry, hemp, tea, bamboo, kapok, tung oil, cassia, cordyceps, poria cocos, cinnamon, cardamom and other more than one hundred kinds of economic crops can be produced. We must patiently encourage overseas Chinese and the masses of the people to engage in our country's unique agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production to increase national wealth and make the socialist cause move forward!
    In accordance with Chairman Mao's order on the "Regulations on Overseas Chinese Applying to Use State-Owned Barren Mountains and Wasteland," we plan to establish overseas Chinese tropical crop reclamation companies in Hainan Island, Yunnan, Fujian, and other places in the near future. The Hainan region has already allocated 500,000 to 600,000 mu of the most ideal land; Yunnan and Fujian will also provide more wasteland to welcome overseas Chinese to return to China to invest in establishing reclamation farms in various ways such as cooperative management, joint state-private management, and private investment management. It is hoped that the relevant regions and departments will provide support and guidance to overseas Chinese who return to China to operate tropical economic crops, so that overseas Chinese can exert greater strength for the construction of the motherland.
    Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asian countries of residence have long worked hard alongside the local people, pioneering and dedicating themselves to the local economic prosperity and construction cause, and have good experience in long-term operation of tropical economic crops. In the future, overseas Chinese are very willing to contribute this expertise to the motherland for the development of economic crop production. It is hoped that overseas Chinese will actively work hard in this regard.
    In our country's vast and fertile fields, various kinds of crops are produced, which can truly be said to be "a hundred flowers blooming." However, the planting of tropical crops in our country has not yet been developed as it should be. It is hoped that overseas Chinese will actively return to China to invest in reclamation undertakings, so that the flowers and fruits of tropical crops can bloom all over the beautiful south of the motherland!
    In recent years, more than 200,000 overseas Chinese have returned to China, and most of them have taken up various construction posts. However, in the past, there were many shortcomings in the resettlement of returned overseas Chinese that failed to allocate jobs properly according to their strengths, such as assigning dentists to do dispatch work and assigning artists with considerable skills to work as salespersons. In some individual areas, there was also a serious phenomenon of "mobilizing" returned overseas Chinese to deposit money after they were employed, without even paying them wages. In the future, all regions must properly resettle returned overseas Chinese according to their expertise and actual situation, and those who are really improperly assigned can be appropriately adjusted; for senior intellectuals, we must pay particular attention to implementing the central government's policies on intellectuals, allocating work suitable for their abilities, and making their learning consistent with their use. For all the shortcomings in handling their work and life problems in the past that were inconsistent with the policies, we must actively take various appropriate measures to correct them. Only by doing so can we better exert the strength of returned overseas Chinese and serve the construction of the motherland.
    Protect the overseas remittance income of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese and use it according to their wishes.
    Protecting the overseas remittance income of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese and using it according to their wishes is a long-term policy formulated by the state. Although all regions have carried out publicity on a large scale and handled many incidents of infringement on overseas remittances, the policy of protecting overseas remittances has not been implemented universally and deeply enough in some regions, and there are even phenomena of disguised interference in the use of overseas remittances by overseas Chinese families and forced or disguised forced savings and donations, thereby affecting the lives of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese and affecting their enthusiasm for earning overseas remittances. In addition, there are also incorrect ideas among some people who discriminate against overseas remittances and say "don't need overseas remittances if production has developed." We believe that overseas remittances are the main or secondary source of livelihood for nearly 10 million overseas Chinese families in our country, and it is a matter of vital interest to tens of millions of people. In the future, with the development of production, the labor income of overseas Chinese families will continue to grow, but overseas remittance income is needed by overseas Chinese families to improve and raise their material lives, which is beneficial to overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese families, and the country itself. Therefore, we must continue to deeply implement the policy of protecting overseas remittances, and incidents of infringement on overseas remittances must be dealt with seriously, and concrete measures must be taken to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. At the same time, it should be pointed out that it is good and worth encouraging for overseas Chinese families to voluntarily invest overseas remittances to participate in various constructions in their hometowns or use them to improve labor conditions and improve their material living standards. However, state staff must be educated not to force "mobilization" of overseas Chinese families to invest overseas remittances in production, and resolutely prohibit soliciting donations from overseas Chinese families to ensure the free use of overseas remittances by overseas Chinese families. The requirements of overseas Chinese families for the supply of consumer goods should be met as much as possible.
    We have confidence in doing a good job in overseas Chinese affairs work.
    Dear representatives: Overseas Chinese abroad love the motherland, and they will actively participate in and support the construction cause of the motherland. They actively support the country's peaceful diplomatic policy abroad, enhance friendship with the people of their countries of residence, and they have made many contributions to the economic trade, technology, and cultural exchanges between their countries of residence and our country, and promote the friendly relations between our country and their countries of residence. The people of many countries also understand our country through overseas Chinese. On the other hand, overseas Chinese have close ties with domestic overseas Chinese families. Many overseas Chinese marry local people. Any small problems and measures in the country will affect overseas Chinese abroad, as well as the views of the people of their countries of residence on our country. Therefore, this requires us to correctly treat and act according to the characteristics of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese families, so that we can handle the problems of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese as much as possible and expand our country's influence.
    In recent years, the patriotic enthusiasm and socialist consciousness of the vast number of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese have been continuously improving. As long as we are good at arranging work according to their special circumstances, strengthening their political and ideological education, and caring about their hardships, we can fully exert the enthusiasm of returned overseas Chinese and their families and guide them to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland alongside the domestic people and shoulder the glorious tasks that they should bear.
    In response to the errors of subjectivism and bureaucracy produced by our overseas Chinese affairs organs and domestic overseas Chinese affairs work, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission held an enlarged meeting in early June specifically to discuss domestic overseas Chinese affairs work. Through this enlarged meeting of overseas Chinese affairs, sharp criticism and self-criticism were launched, and extensive and in-depth discussions were held on how to implement overseas Chinese affairs policies in the future. Many overseas Chinese affairs policies are now clearer and more specific than in the past. At the same time, after the enlarged meeting, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, with Mr. Chen Jiageng as the chairman, was established as a people's organization of returned overseas Chinese to actively carry out the work of uniting returned overseas Chinese across the country. In the future, we will be more conscientious, realistic, guard against pursuing quick success, guard against impetuosity, work diligently, adapt to local conditions, and correctly resolve the relationship between the central work of various regions and overseas Chinese affairs work to further implement overseas Chinese affairs policies and carry out overseas Chinese affairs work. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and relying on the support and assistance of relevant departments and relevant parties, we have the confidence to do a good job in overseas Chinese affairs work.
    Overseas Chinese abroad will also follow the country's peaceful diplomatic policy and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, promote and carry forward the valuable historical friendship with the people of their countries of residence, and promote cultural exchanges and economic cooperation between overseas Chinese and the people of their countries of residence. Overseas Chinese abroad will also help each other more, expand patriotic unity, and actively support the socialist construction of the motherland and the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    进一步贯彻执行侨务政策，开展侨务工作 
    ——华侨事务委员会主任何香凝的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程
  （草案）所作的解释说明，彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告以及陈云副总理、李富春副总理、邓子恢副总理的报告和发言。我国1955年决算和1956年预算不但生动地反映了我国建设力量的充沛和增强、我国人民进行和平建设的愿望以及国家对于人民生活的关切，说明了国家收支的平衡，并且有可能在友好合作的基础上对友邦国家进行经济援助。所有这一切，不但使国内人民兴奋鼓舞，而且将使国外华侨更加爱国、团结。
    华侨在支持祖国建设方面、在促进祖国和东南亚国家的友好关系方面都有一定贡献
    华侨倾向祖国，许多访问过东南亚的英美记者也不得不承认，“就像跟着磁石的趋向转动一样”。这都是和祖国的发展、国际地位的提高分不开的。
    一年来，我国和东南亚各国的友好关系不断增进，华侨与侨居国人民之间的传统友谊都有了进一步发展。华侨拥护和支持祖国的社会主义建设，积极协助侨居国人民繁荣当地民族经济，并且对于促进祖国和东南亚国家的友好关系，是有了一定的贡献的。
    在国内由于各地党政领导机关、有关部门以及侨区工作人员的大力支持和积极努力，侨务工作也取得了一些成绩。1955年2月，国务院颁布了“关于贯彻保护侨汇政策的命令”，在贯彻得好的地区，得到了华侨、侨眷的拥护；同年8月毛泽东主席又颁布了“华侨申请使用国有的荒山荒地条例”，大大鼓舞了归侨、侨眷参加国家建设的热情；侨眷归侨的粮食供应，也已按照侨眷的特殊情况得到适当照顾；在反对保守主义的基础上，侨务工作也克服了过去某些束手束脚的现象。在伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的高潮中，侨眷加入农业生产合作社的已达到侨户总数的90％以上，转入高级合作社的达到50％左右。归侨、侨眷当中涌现了不少的劳动模范和先进工作者。绝大部分归侨中的工商业者也积极地接受了社会主义改造。
    这些都获得了国外华侨的拥护，促进了他们的爱国团结。华侨回国投资参加祖国建设的积极性更为提高了，去年一年，华侨回国投资的比较过去（1951至1954）多了50％，全国的侨汇也有了增加。回国观光的华侨比去年增加了很多。
    根据侨眷、归侨的具体情况和专长，来安排他们所自愿的劳动
    但是，随着我们的工作进一步开展，在侨区的农业合作化高潮中，部分地区产生了粗糙急躁的作风，忽视了侨眷、归侨的一些特殊情况，对十二年的农业发展纲要，许多规划是原来要在十二年完成的，却想在三几年内完成，因此也出现了一些问题。
    侨眷、归侨是愿意参加劳动的，但是许多侨户的主要劳动力是在国外，在国内的劳动力一般都较弱，我们对他们劳动力的情况和特点，没有估计清楚，也没有注意发挥他们的劳动专长，妥加安排，未能区别对待，反而分配他们力不胜任的劳动，甚至对少数鳏、寡、孤、独、老、弱、病、残、缺乏劳动力的侨眷，也漠视其家庭劳动，片面地强调劳动出勤率。侨眷、归侨当中有不少的人虽不胜任从事主粮生产，但他们却能够或者善于作经济作物及副业生产。一些侨区初级农业社转入高级社后，由于集中力量增加粮食生产，就产生了强迫取消副业、改种粮食的偏向。如广东开平，搞掉了大蒜；潮阳砍伐柑桔树改种粮食；顺德大良大批砍伐桑树，以致蚕茧大量浪费掉，即显著的例子。结果，侨眷、归侨收入减少。有些侨区合作社的生产和非生产的投资过多，而又将投资负担加在有侨汇的侨眷身上。如福建泉州，有一个合作社动员华侨投资了两千块钱，却用来办俱乐部化掉了。这就造成了侨眷社员的负担太重，增加了他们的思想顾虑。
    在上述的情况下引起了侨眷不安于乡居，部分出国，今年三、四月间侨汇比去年同期间反而减少，这是必须重视和加以解决的。对于这些问题，中央和地方已及时地采取了一些措施，我在这里只就一些问题加以说明：
    我们认为，一部分侨眷、归侨尚未习惯农业重劳动的操作，不能以国内一般农民的水平过高要求他们，需要采取长期耐心教育办法，帮助他们，学习农业劳动技术。同时我们必须肯定从事家务劳动，养猪、养牛、养羊、养鸡、养鸭也都是劳动。广东省规定：对于依靠侨汇为生的侨眷，和尚不愿参加农业劳动的，也应允许其不参加劳动，不排工，不规定他们的出勤率；如有自愿参加的，应表示欢迎，愿作甚么就作甚么，做多少算多少；对于部分依靠侨汇生活，身体弱，年纪老的侨眷，合作社应主动予以照顾，分配适合其体力条件和劳动能力的工作或由其选择工种自报工时。这个规定是很必要的。因此希望侨区各级政府，需要根据侨眷、归侨力所胜任并最能发挥他们积极性的，实事求是地制订生产计划，妥善安排每个人所志愿的劳动。
    在归侨、侨眷众多地区，有些合作社社员大部分甚至全部是侨眷，劳动力薄弱，不胜任耕种主粮，应该坚决贯彻中共中央、国务院关于勤俭办社中提出的“开辟生产门路，发展副业生产，经营多种经济”指示。这样做，可以使侨眷、归侨的生产在并社时也可以作为一个生产单位（队或组），侨眷、归侨也能在各种不同的岗位上从事生产，给国家增加财富，给自己增加收入，保证生活能够逐步改善和提高。
    为了根据侨眷、归侨特点与特长分配适合其能力的工作，可分配不习惯农业劳动的侨眷以饲养家畜家禽（如猪、羊、牛、鸡、鸭、鹅、火鸡）、养蜂、种植蓖麻、养蓖麻蚕、种桑、种茶及油料作物等。或组织他们从事针织、刺绣等手工业，以及参加合作社中的文化、教育、卫生等工作，使这些愿意劳动的侨眷都得到合理分工，各得其所。
    对种植经济作物和搞副业生产的合作社，可以允许减轻甚至免除主粮生产任务。经济作物在纳入地方的生产计划后，必须合理地掌握价格政策，真正做到有劳有酬，对搞经济作物的侨眷，也应照其需要供应粮食，以鼓励他们生产的积极性。
    希望华侨积极回国投资垦殖事业，把经营热带经济作物的特长贡献给祖国
    我国人口众多，人力丰富，又富有寒、温、热带的农业产品和经济作物特产，对社会主义建设和对外贸易将有帮助，所以在这些方面，具有非常优越的条件。帝国主义国家掠夺殖民地附属国的经济作物原料来造成工业品，倾销国外，剥削殖民地人民使他们生活日益困苦。我们是社会主义，我们要好好利用我们所具有的优越条件，发挥更大的作用，创造更优越条件，给世界人民作更大贡献。在我国广东、福建、广西、云南及贵州南部地区，可产橡胶、咖啡、甘蔗、剑麻、蓖麻、椰子、香茅、金鸡纳霜、烟草、樟脑、可可、槟榔、胡椒、菠萝、橄榄、柑、橙、香蕉、荔枝、龙眼、杨桃、柚子、油棕、海岛棉、毒鱼藤、桑、麻、茶、竹、木棉、桐油、玉桂、冬虫草、云苓、桂皮、豆蔻等等一百多种经济作物。我们要耐心鼓励侨胞和人民大众，从事我国特有的农业、林业、牧业生产，增加国家财富，使社会主义事业更加向前推进！
    遵照毛主席关于“华侨申请使用国有的荒山荒地条例”的命令，最近短期间，我们拟在海南岛、云南、福建等地成立华侨热带作物垦殖公司，海南区已经拨出最理想的土地五、六十万亩；云南、福建也将供给更多的荒地，欢迎华侨回国投资以合作经营、公私合营、私资经营等各种方式建立垦殖场。希望各有关地区、有关部门给回国经营热带经济作物的华侨以支持和辅导，使华侨能为祖国建设发挥更大的力量。
    华侨在东南亚各侨居国，长期以来和当地人民一道，披荆斩棘，辛苦劳动，致力于当地的经济繁荣和建设事业，有长期经营热带经济作物的优良经验。今后对祖国发展经济作物生产，华侨是很愿意把这个特长贡献给祖国的。希望华侨在这方面踊跃努力。
    在我国广大肥美的田野，盛产各种各样的农作物，真可以说是“百花齐放”。但是，我国热带作物的种植尚未得到应有的发展。希望华侨积极回国投资垦殖事业，使热带作物的花果开遍在祖国美丽的南方！
    几年来归国华侨有二十万人以上，大部分都走上了各个建设岗位。但过去在安置归侨工作中也有着未能按照所长、分配工作不当的不少缺点，如把牙科医生分配去做收发工作，把有相当水平的美术工作者分配去当售货员。个别地区还发生归侨就业后，非但不给薪金，反而“动员”归侨存款的严重现象。今后各地区必须根据归侨特长和实际情况妥善安置，实在分配不当者，可适当加以调整；对于高级知识分子，尤须注意贯彻执行中央有关知识分子的政策，分配适合其能力的工作，使其学用一致。对于过去在处理他们工作和生活问题上种种与政策不符的缺点，必须积极采取各种适当措施，予以纠正。这样做，才能更好地发挥归侨力量，为祖国建设服务。
    保护侨眷、归侨的侨汇收入和按其志愿的使用
    保护侨眷、归侨的侨汇收入和按其志愿的使用，是国家制定的长远政策。各地区虽已大张旗鼓的进行了宣传，并处理了不少侵犯侨汇的事件，但有些地区对保护侨汇的政策还是贯彻得不够普遍和深入，甚至还有变相地干涉侨眷对侨汇的使用、强迫或变相地强迫储蓄和捐献的现象，因而影响侨眷、归侨的生活，影响他们争取侨汇的积极性。此外，在一些人当中也存在着歧视侨汇与“生产发展了，不要侨汇”的错误思想。我们认为：侨汇是我国近千万侨眷的主要或次要的生活来源，是关系到成千万群众的切身利益问题。今后随着生产发展，侨眷劳动收入将不断增长，但是侨汇收入，乃是侨眷改善和提高物质生活所需，对华侨、侨眷本身和对国家都是有好处的。因此必须继续深入贯彻保护侨汇政策，对侵犯侨汇事件必须严肃处理，并采取具体措施防止此类事件的继续发生。同时应该指出：侨眷自愿以侨汇投资参加家乡各项建设，或用以改善劳动条件与提高物质生活水平，这些是好的，值得鼓励的。但必须教育国家工作人员，不得强迫“动员”侨眷将侨汇投入生产，坚决禁止向侨眷募捐，以保证侨眷的侨汇的自由使用。对侨眷供应生活消费品的要求，应尽力予以满足。
    我们有信心把侨务工作做好
    各位代表：国外华侨是热爱祖国的，他们对祖国的建设事业是会积极参加和支持的。他们在国外积极地拥护国家的和平外交政策，增进了和侨居国人民的友谊，他们对侨居国与我国的经济贸易、技术和文化交流，促进我国与侨居国的友好关系有不少的贡献。许多国家人民也是通过华侨了解我国情况的。另一方面华侨和国内侨眷有密切的关连，不少华侨与当地人民通婚，国内任何细小的问题和措施，都会影响到国外华侨，以及影响到侨居国人民对我国观感。因此，这就要求我们必须正确对待和根据华侨、侨眷的特点，以便尽可能地处理好侨眷、归侨的问题，扩大我们国家的影响。
    几年来，广大侨眷、归侨的爱国热情和社会主义觉悟是在不断的提高。只要我们善于根据他们的特殊情况，布置工作，加强对他们的政治思想教育，关心他们的疾苦，我们完全可以发挥归侨、侨眷的积极性，引导他们和国内人民一道，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设，担负其应负担的光荣任务。
    针对着我们侨务机关以及国内侨务工作方面产生的主观主义和官僚主义的错误，华侨事务委员会在6月上旬召开专门讨论国内侨务工作的扩大会议，经过这次侨务扩大会议，展开了尖锐的批评和自我批评，对今后如何贯彻侨务政策，进行了广泛深入的讨论，许多侨务政策比过去更加明确和具体了。同时，在扩大会议之后，成立了以陈嘉庚先生为主任委员的中华全国归国华侨联合会筹委会作为归国华侨的人民团体，积极开展团结全国归侨的工作。今后我们必将更加兢兢业业、实事求是、戒追功、戒急躁、勤勤恳恳、因地制宜，以及正确地解决各地中心工作与侨务工作的关系，来进一步贯彻侨务政策，开展侨务工作。我们在中央和毛主席的正确领导下，依靠有关各部门和有关方面的支持和帮助，是有信心把侨务工作做好的。
    国外华侨也必将更加遵循祖国的和平外交政策及和平共处的五大原则，发扬光大与侨居国人民宝贵的历史友谊，促进华侨与侨居国人民的文化交流与经济合作。国外华侨也必将更加互助互济，扩大爱国团结，积极拥护和支持祖国的社会主义建设及解放台湾的斗争。
