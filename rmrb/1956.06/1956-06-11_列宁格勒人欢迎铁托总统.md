Leningraders Welcome President Tito
By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Hu Sisheng

Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second largest city with a population of 3.5 million, was different on the morning of June 7th. More than seventy Soviet, Yugoslav, and foreign journalists who had come to cover Yugoslav President Tito's visit to Leningrad, upon stepping out of the train, saw the platform of Leningrad's "Moscow Station," the roofs of the carriages, and the square near the station all packed with welcoming crowds and banners. At 10:00 a.m., when the special train arrived and Yugoslav President Tito, accompanied by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Bulganin and Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov, stepped onto the platform, cheers of "Hurrah," enthusiastic applause, and waving flowers intertwined with Leningrad's beautiful sunshine.

At noon on June 7th, Tito, accompanied by Bulganin, visited the Leningrad "Elektrosila Factory," the oldest electrical machinery manufacturing plant in the Soviet Union and a recipient of three Orders of Lenin. After the visit, a mass rally was held in the factory's square. Tito and Bulganin spoke about how the stronger the friendship between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples, the more secure world peace would be. Their words were repeatedly drowned out by storms of applause and cheers. Among the workers at this factory, many were veterans of World War II. Turner Kachachev, who participated in the liberation of Belgrade, told everyone how the Yugoslav people had treated the Soviet soldiers as brothers. Fitter Pavlov, who was wounded in the Battle of Belgrade, told reporters: "I am proud to have shed my blood for the freedom of the fraternal Yugoslav people." Young Chinese experts interning at the factory also expressed their delight at being able to see the leaders of two countries that are very close to the Chinese people.

On the afternoon of June 7th, Tito, Bulganin, Shepilov, and others strolled along the world-famous Nevsky Prospekt and the Summer Garden. In the open-air café in the Summer Garden, Tito spoke with visitors. One Leningrad resident asked Tito:
	"Have you been to Leningrad before?"
	"I was in Petrograd (i.e., present-day Leningrad) in July 1917."
	"Were you imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress?"
	"Yes, not for long – three weeks. It was very damp there, and I got a mild case of rheumatism as a result."
Someone else said: "Comrade Tito, please convey our heartfelt respect to the fraternal Yugoslav people." A woman standing next to this person added: "Yes, please be sure to convey our respect." Comrade Tito smiled and said, "I will definitely convey it."

At this time, many Leningrad children looked at Tito and Bulganin with the unique and sincere gaze of children. Tito and Bulganin invited these children to eat candy and ice cream.

On the evening of June 7th, Tito, Bulganin, Shepilov, and others attended a performance of Tchaikovsky's ballet "Sleeping Beauty" at the Leningrad Kirov Opera and Ballet Theatre.

June 8th was Tito and Bulganin's second day in Leningrad. In the early morning, a shower of summer rain washed the wide boulevards of Leningrad. Around eleven o'clock, the sky cleared up again. At twelve o'clock, Tito and Bulganin arrived by motorboat to visit Peterhof, one of the most attractive sights in Leningrad and the entire Soviet Union. After disembarking, a group of Young Pioneers, led by their counselor, presented flowers to Tito and Bulganin. When a Young Pioneer squad leader said, "I saw two marshals today," Tito said with a smile, "You will be the third marshal," and everyone laughed. Such friendly and cordial conversation continued for a while.

Peterhof, with its unique and varied fountains, captivated the Yugoslav guests. Tito said while watching, "A charming garden, beautiful fountains." In Peterhof, tourists crowded around the guests, and photographers and photography enthusiasts were all vying for good shots. A twelve-year-old photography enthusiast could not squeeze through the crowd and was almost crying. Comrade Tito noticed this and said, "We should help him." He asked everyone to stop for a moment, and then said, "Take the picture, kid."

After leaving Peterhof, the guests returned to Leningrad by car. Along the way, welcoming crowds frequently waved to Tito and Bulganin. In the Leningrad city center, the guests visited the subway and a museum. In the evening, Tito, accompanied by Bulganin, left Leningrad by train.

Tito and Bulganin spent a short two days, which gave the impression that the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is growing stronger day by day.

    列宁格勒人欢迎铁托总统
    本报驻苏联记者　胡思升
    六月七日早晨，列宁格勒这个拥有三百五十万居民的苏联第二大城市和往日不同。来采访南斯拉夫总统铁托访问列宁格勒的七十多个苏联、南斯拉夫和外国记者一走出车厢，就看到列宁格勒的“莫斯科车站”的月台上、车厢的顶篷上、车站附近的广场上到处都挤满了欢迎的人群和欢迎的横幅标语。上午十时，当专车到达，南斯拉夫总统铁托在苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫陪同下走上月台时，“乌拉”的欢呼声、热烈的鼓掌、挥舞的鲜花同列宁格勒的美好阳光交织在一起。
    六月七日正午，铁托在布尔加宁陪同下参观苏联最老的电机制造工厂、获得三次列宁勋章的列宁格勒“电力电工器材工厂”。参观完毕后，在工厂的广场上举行了群众大会。铁托和布尔加宁谈到苏南两国人民友谊愈巩固，世界和平就愈有保障。他们的话一再淹没在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声里。在这个工厂的工人中间，有不少是参加过第二次世界大战的军人。参加过解放贝尔格莱德战役的旋工卡查切夫向大家叙述当时南斯拉夫人民怎样友好地像兄弟一样地对待苏联军人。在贝尔格莱德战役中负伤的钳工巴夫洛夫向记者说：“我很自豪，曾经为了兄弟的南斯拉夫人民获得自由洒出自己的鲜血。”在这个工厂实习的中国青年专家也表示很高兴能够见到同中国人民十分亲近的两个国家的领导人。
    六月七日下午，铁托、布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫等一起信步漫游举世闻名的涅瓦大街和夏季公园。在夏季公园的露天咖啡室里，铁托同游览者谈起话来。一个列宁格勒人问铁托：
      “你来过列宁格勒吗？”
      “在1917年7月的日子里，我曾经在彼得堡（即现在的列宁格勒）。”
    “你曾被囚禁在彼得罗巴夫洛夫斯克堡垒吗？”
      “是的，不太长——三个星期。那里很潮湿，我因此得了轻度的风湿症。”
    又有人说道：“铁托同志，请把我们的衷心敬意带给兄弟的南斯拉夫人民。”站在这个人旁边的一位妇女又加上一句：“对，请一定转达我们的敬意。”铁托同志微笑起来，说“一定转达”。
    这时，许多列宁格勒的儿童以儿童特有的真挚的目光望着铁托和布尔加宁。铁托和布尔加宁邀请这些儿童吃糖果和冰淇淋。
    六月七日晚上，铁托、布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫等一起在列宁格勒基洛夫实验歌剧和巴蕾舞剧院观看柴可夫斯基的巴蕾舞剧
  “睡美人”。
    六月八日是铁托和布尔加宁在列宁格勒的第二天。清晨阵阵夏雨冲洗着列宁格勒的宽阔的林荫道。十一时许，天空又放晴了。十二时，铁托、布尔加宁乘汽艇到达了列宁格勒和全苏联最引人的名胜之一——彼得宫参观。下汽艇后，一群少先队员在辅导员带领下向铁托、布尔加宁献花。当一个少先队的分队长说：“我今天看见了二个元帅”时，铁托笑着说：“你将是第三个元帅”，大家都哄笑起来。这样友好亲切的谈话继续了一会儿。
    彼得宫以它特有的千姿百态的喷水泉吸引住了南斯拉夫贵宾，铁托一面观看一面说：“迷人的花园、漂亮的喷水泉。”在彼得宫里，游人簇拥着客人们，摄影记者和摄影爱好者都在抢好镜头，一个十二岁的少年摄影爱好者无论如何挤不过旁人，几乎要哭出声来，铁托同志注意到后，就说：“应该帮助他”。他请求大家停一下，接着说：“请照吧，孩子”。
    从彼得宫出来，客人们坐汽车回列宁格勒，沿路欢迎的人群频频向铁托、布尔加宁招手。在列宁格勒市区，客人们参观了地下铁道和一个博物馆。傍晚，铁托在布尔加宁陪同下坐火车离开列宁格勒。
    铁托和布尔加宁度过了短短的两天，这两天给人以苏联和南斯拉夫两国人民友谊日益巩固的感觉。
