Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 24th: Over a thousand people from all walks of life in Hangzhou held a warm get-together with Soviet military officers and soldiers visiting Hangzhou at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall on the evening of the 23rd.

　　In the evening, when the Soviet friends arrived at the venue, applause and cheers rang out. A group of Young Pioneers jumped up to welcome them. The hosts also presented bouquets of flowers to the guests.

　　At the beginning of the celebration, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations of Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City presented a banner to the guests. Students from Hangzhou No. 4 Middle School presented a model ship they had made to the guests. The Soviet military representatives, after accepting the gift, said that they would send the model ship to the "Children's Home" in Vladivostok.

　　It started to rain. The guests and hosts danced joyfully in the open-air dance floor despite the rain. The guests were particularly interested in the children's game room, which was decorated by the children themselves, featuring various games such as treasure hunting and fishing. Many guests scored five points in each game, and the children awarded them stone-carved peace doves and various interesting prizes.

　　In every corner of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall, Soviet military officers and soldiers were engaged in friendly conversations with many welcoming people. A Chinese Navy lieutenant took off his own commemorative medal and gave it to Soviet Navy Lieutenant Markov. They embraced tightly, and Markov said: "I will never forget the friendship of the Chinese people!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 24th: On the 23rd, Soviet naval officers and soldiers in Hangzhou visited scenic spots and historical sites around West Lake.

    In the morning, Soviet friends arrived at the Liuhe Pagoda on Yuelun Mountain and overlooked the Qiantang River and the Qianjiang Bridge spanning the river from the top floor of the pagoda.

    When the guests traveled by car along Bai Causeway and Beishan Road to Lingyin Temple in the afternoon, people resting under the willows by the lakeside park cordially waved hello to the friends. Under Feilai Peak at Lingyin Temple, ten-year-old Chinese girl Hu Lingna and Soviet sailor Shepira became friends. Before parting, they left messages for each other on pieces of paper. Shepira wrote: "Let us always remember this meeting!" Hu Lingna picked up her pen and wrote neatly: "I will study hard and learn from the Soviet naval uncles." Four-year-old Chinese "Little Navy" Zhang Hong kissed Soviet Navy Captain Arjuchen.

    On this day, Soviet naval officers and soldiers swam in the cool spring water of Yuquan Swimming Pool. Navy Lieutenant Markov said after leaving the swimming pool: "I have left my heart there!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 24th: More than one hundred officers and soldiers of the Soviet friendly visiting fleet returned to Shanghai by train tonight after visiting Hangzhou for two days. Representatives of the Zhejiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee went to the station to see them off.
