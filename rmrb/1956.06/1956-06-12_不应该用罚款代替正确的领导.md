Fines Should Not Replace Correct Leadership
Wang Pu

Recently, newspapers such as the "Worker's Daily" and "Highway Transport Worker" have exposed the erroneous behavior of leaders in some enterprises who, under the pretext of "consolidating labor discipline" and "ensuring the completion of plans," have resorted to deducting wages from some workers.

The "Provisional Regulations on Rewards and Punishments" of the Heilongjiang Provincial Transportation Company stipulate that workers who are responsible for accidents, fail to meet fuel and tire consumption quotas, experience sudden tire damage, or fail to complete production plans will be fined. From June of last year to March of this year, according to statistics from nine city and county organizations under the company, including Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and Anda, the number of employees who were fined accounted for approximately 40% of the total.

Similar things happened at the Fourth Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. There, seven or eight kinds of "systems" for deducting workers' wages were established. A carpentry team in the Second Mining Area supported more than 130 canopies, of which more than ten were unqualified, and the team leader of the mining area deducted all the wages of the carpentry team. They also stipulated that those who are late for meetings or reports will also be fined. Worker Cao Jinxiang was fined one day's work for being two minutes late for a pre-shift meeting due to rain, which was regarded as "absenteeism" and his bonus for the month was cancelled. Wang Youcheng, a foreman in the Transportation and Repair Area, was fined 6.40 yuan for reporting to the district chief more than 30 minutes late. What was done with the money from these fines? This Transportation and Repair Area used the fines to buy candy and cigarettes for class meetings, purchase office supplies, and reward other workers. Some districts even deposited the fines in the bank to earn interest. What an absurd thing!

It is said that these people dare to do this, and can do it happily and calmly, because they are using the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" as a shield, and often especially emphasize the provisions on discipline. However, these people do not emphasize the provisions on the "basic responsibilities of enterprise administration"; what is even worse is that some administrative personnel not only fail to fulfill their responsibilities, but even push the blame for their own dereliction of duty onto the workers. The coal cutting machine drivers of the Fourth Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau made several suggestions to the leaders, requesting that the traction rope, which was thinner than stipulated, be replaced, but the leading staff turned a deaf ear and took no action. When coal cutting machine driver Chen Zhangni broke the traction rope, he was fined six yuan. In the Qiqihar Transportation Company, due to the irresponsibility of the leading staff, the machines were not repaired, the mileage was inaccurate, and excessive fuel consumption resulted, and the blame was placed on the workers. Veteran worker Li Guifa, a provincial and municipal model worker, was fined 77 yuan last November for this reason.

The Party and the state have repeatedly instructed that the main method of helping workers overcome shortcomings is to rely on persuasion and education, and that only those who repeatedly refuse to mend their ways should be given different degrees of punishment, but this is also to better carry out political and ideological education for the workers. In the leaders of the above-mentioned enterprises, we cannot see their efforts in this regard, nor can we see the guarantee and supervision role of the Party organizations in these enterprises on this issue. What we see is that administrative personnel abuse their powers and punish workers. Originally, they thought that the method of punishment was better than persuasion, which was both labor-saving and "effective." Didn't someone say this: "You have to impose fines, otherwise the workers will not work hard." Will the workers work hard if they are fined? After a large number of fines were imposed at the Jiamusi Transportation Station, the 56 vehicles in the entire station consumed 7,200 kilograms more fuel in the first quarter. The workers said: "Anyway, we are fined every month, so that's it!" This is not a simple sentence, but a sobering agent for those who are obsessed with replacing correct leadership with fines. It is hoped that all leaders who are unwilling to adopt persuasion and education and pursue punishment will wake up.

    不应该用罚款代替正确的领导
    王朴
    在最近的“工人日报”、“公路运输工人”等报上，揭露了某些企业的领导人员，借口要“巩固劳动纪律”和“保证完成计划”，对某些工人采取了扣罚工资的错误行为。
    黑龙江省运输公司的“奖惩暂行条例”规定：对发生责任事故，达不到燃料和轮胎消耗定额，轮胎突然破损、未完成生产计划的工人，一律实行罚款。从去年六月至今年三月，根据这个公司所属的哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、安达等九个市、县机构的统计，受罚款的职工竟占总人数40％左右。
    峰峰矿务局四矿也发生类似的事。那里建立了七八种扣罚工人工资的“制度”。二采区一个木工小组，支了一百三十多架棚子，其中有十多架不合格，而采区班长却扣罚了木工小组的全部工资。他们还规定，不按时开会、汇报的，同样要受罚。工人曹金相，在开班前会的时候因下雨迟到两分钟，被罚停工一日，按
  “旷工”论，取消了当月的奖金。运修区的一个班长王有成向区长汇报迟了三十多分钟，被罚款六元四角。他们罚的这些钱干什么用了呢？这个运修区把罚款用于：开班务会买糖和纸烟；购置办公用品；奖励其他的工人。有的区甚至把罚款存入银行生息。这是多么荒谬的事！
    据说，这些人敢于这样做，做了还能愉快、心平气和，是拿着“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”做挡箭牌，而且常常特别强调其中关于处分的规定。可是，这些人却不强调其中关于“企业行政方面的基本职责”的规定；更恶劣的是，有些行政人员不但不履行自己的职责，甚至把自己失职的过错也推到工人的头上。峰峰矿务局四矿的割煤机司机，几次向领导人员提出意见，要求把比规定细一分的牵引绳换一下，领导工作人员在那里装聋作哑，迟迟没有行动。当割煤司机陈章妮把牵引绳拉断的时候，却被罚款六元。在齐齐哈尔市运输公司里，由于领导工作人员不负责任，使机器失修，里程不准，以致超耗油料，同样把过失安在工人的身上。老工人李贵发是省和市的劳动模范，就是为了这个原因，在去年十一月被罚款七十七元。
    党和国家一再指示，帮助工人克服缺点的主要方法是依靠说服教育，只有对那些屡教不改的人才给予不同程度的处分，但是这也是为了更好地对工人进行政治思想教育。在上述企业的领导工作人员身上，我们看不到他们在这方面的努力，也看不到这些企业中党组织在这个问题上的保证监督作用。所看到的是：行政人员滥用职权，处罚工人。原来，他们以为惩罚的方法比说服好，既省力，效果又“大”。不是有人这样说吗：“就得实行罚款，不然工人就是不会好好干的”。是不是工人被罚了款就会好好干呢？佳木斯运输总站大量罚款以后，全站五十六辆汽车在第一季度多费油七千二百多公斤。工人们说：“反正月月挨罚，就这样啦！”这不是一句简单的话，这是一剂使那些醉心于用罚款代替正确领导的人的清醒剂。希望一切不愿采用说服教育而追求惩办主义的领导者清醒过来。
