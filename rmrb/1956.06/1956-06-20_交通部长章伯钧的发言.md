Transportation sector's new achievements in implementing the First Five-Year Plan: Total national highway mileage reaches 183,000 kilometers – The shipping industry's new production capacity grows year by year – Fundamental changes occur in the economic composition of the transportation industry.
The passive situation in capital construction work has not been completely reversed – Insufficient automobile transport capacity – The socialist transformation of the private transportation industry is too slow – Future attention should be paid to developing ocean shipping – Especially relying on the initiative of local areas and the masses – Establishing scientific research institutions for water transport and highways – Calling on overseas Chinese scientists to return home as soon as possible.
    I fully agree with the report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council. Judging from last year's national final accounts, industrial profits increased and agricultural tax revenue exceeded the target, ensuring a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure under the premise of guaranteeing investment in economic construction and the needs of culture and education. This proves that measures to practice economy and combat waste have been effective. This year's national budget allocation is also reasonable, and the socialist accumulation of state-owned enterprises has become the main source of income. Judging from the expenditure budget, 52.22% is used for economic construction, 19.98% for national defense, and 12.74% for culture and education, which is in line with the Chinese people's desire for peaceful construction. The realization of this budget guarantees financially that the Chinese people will complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The people of the whole country should make due efforts to realize this budget for peaceful construction.

    Over the past year, the national financial situation has been satisfactory. Not only that, but even more gratifying is that the various important political and economic measures taken by the state to create a peaceful construction environment have had extremely broad and profound influence and effect. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been accepted by more countries, the international situation is tending to ease, and foreign trade is expanding. What is particularly exciting is that China's socialist revolution has entered a climax and achieved a decisive victory, promoting work in all aspects and pushing the national economy and cultural undertakings to new heights.

    Under the new upsurge of China's national economy, the transportation sector has set off a mass socialist production upsurge, extensively carried out advanced producer movements, and achieved new achievements in implementing the First Five-Year Plan.

    The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the central investment highway construction task is 10,154 kilometers, which can be completed more than a year ahead of schedule. Among the newly built highways, in addition to the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, highways such as the highway from Chengdu to Aba in Sichuan Province, the highway from Xining to Yushu in Qinghai Province, the highway from Fohai to Xilancang and Gejiu to Nafa in Yunnan Province, and the highway from Gyangze to Yadong and Gyangze to Shigatse in the Tibet region have all been completed and opened to traffic. By April this year, the total mileage of highways open to traffic nationwide reached 183,000 kilometers. In the next two years, we will continue to increase the construction of new highways, and the highway from Xinjiang to Tibet will start construction. As for local road construction, it is developing rapidly due to the strong support of the broad masses of rural people. From January to April this year, 2,762 kilometers of trunk highways, 17,748 kilometers of simple highways, 39,388 kilometers of cart tracks, and 1,804 kilometers of pack animal trails were built. With the increase in highway mileage, automobile transportation tasks have greatly increased. Last year, the freight turnover of automobiles increased by 35% compared with the previous year, and this year it increased by 31% compared with last year.

    In terms of shipping, inland and sea transport overfulfilled the plan last year, and from January to May this year, the volume of inland and sea freight completed 104% of the plan. Judging from the current situation, the national tugboat transportation target set in the Five-Year Plan may be completed ahead of schedule. The shipping cost target may be completed one year ahead of schedule. The reliable basis for this is the continuous increase in labor productivity and the improvement of ship utilization efficiency. Last year, the efficiency of coastal Bohai Sea routes and Yangtze River ships increased by 40%-50% compared with 1952, and the efficiency of Yangtze River tugboats increased by 244%. Due to the improvement of ship utilization efficiency and the reduction of fuel costs, shipping costs have been reduced. The cost of state-owned inland and sea transport has been reduced by more than 40% compared with 1952, thus providing conditions for reducing freight rates. At the beginning of this year, we implemented new freight rates. This new freight rate is about one-third lower than in 1952.

    The new production capacity of the shipping industry has been growing year by year, and the ship construction and port construction stipulated in the Five-Year Plan can be overfulfilled. In addition to the progress that has been completed in the past two years, 132 new ships have been put into production for inland and sea transport last year; the newly added throughput capacity of key construction ports is 1.3 million tons; the Zhanjiang Commercial Port project, which the State Council decided to build last July, has started construction in the same year. Except for the oil terminal and oil depot, the first phase of the project can be completed within this year and officially opened to traffic.

    The construction of Zhanjiang Commercial Port is a large project with complex technology. It is the first time in Chinese history to build such a modern seaport with its own technical strength. After the completion of the first phase of the seaport project, according to the design task, the throughput capacity will reach 1.6 million tons; it can allow 10,000-ton ocean-going freighters with a draft of 8.9 meters to enter the port; cargo loading and unloading operations are basically carried out by machinery.

    As everyone knows, Zhanjiang Commercial Port is a good deep-water port on the southern coast of China, which is of great significance and role for the development of international trade, especially for the development of trade with Southeast Asian countries. It is estimated that foreign trade will become more frequent in the future. In order to facilitate the expansion of import and export materials and give full play to the effectiveness of Zhanjiang Commercial Port, we plan to continue construction in the second and third phases according to the annual throughput capacity of 4.6 million tons to meet the upcoming expansion of foreign trade business.

    The economic composition of the transportation industry has fundamentally changed. By the first quarter of this year, except for private ships and automobiles that have been fully incorporated into joint state-private ownership, 81% of wooden sailboats have been incorporated into cooperation and fixed-interest joint operation, 71% of specialized animal-drawn vehicles have been incorporated into cooperation, and 31% of rickshaws have been incorporated into cooperation.

    Of course, these achievements are only one aspect of the work situation. On the other hand, we cannot ignore the many shortcomings that still exist so far.

    In capital construction work, the passive situation of surveying and mapping lagging behind construction and management failing to keep up with the growth of labor productivity has not been completely reversed, resulting in a lot of wasted work, rework, and great waste, and the quality of some projects is low. For trunk highway construction, too much emphasis is placed on coastal borders, and there is a lack of attention to the North China Plain. Local road construction focuses too much on quantity and ignores quality, and some areas lack planning in the use of civilian labor, resulting in blind construction. In the future, we should strengthen the technical supervision and technical design force of capital construction; improve construction organization and management; pay attention to the rational distribution of trunk highways; local roads should be built more planned, pay attention to road quality, and correctly implement the system of civilian labor to build diligence.

    In terms of highway transportation, the whole country generally feels that the automobile transportation capacity is insufficient. The main problem is that China has too few cars and not many new cars have been added. In the past, regional balance could be carried out, but now it is difficult to adjust. In addition to continuing to improve vehicle utilization and fully organizing the use of private transportation tools in various places, the state should control a certain number of reserve vehicles in the stored materials. In the current period, the method of supplementing vehicles should be used to balance automobile transport capacity.

    The socialist transformation of the private transportation industry has been too slow in the past. After carrying out work with the victorious situation of socialist transformation across the country, it is basically healthy. However, there are also shortcomings, such as underestimating the value of assets and ignoring the arrangement of non-executive personnel during joint ventures; excessive retention of cooperative public accumulation funds, etc.; some areas do not implement policies properly. This phenomenon has now been reversed. The main thing is to strengthen policy education, conduct in-depth inspections, and discover and solve problems at any time.

    In shipping work, due to the old ships, we have also neglected technical management; we have focused on quantitative indicators and neglected the improvement of quality; the lack of organic coordination between waterways, navigation marks, and ship safety equipment and political work has resulted in poor transportation quality, many accidents, and untimely transportation. The increase in shipping volume and insufficient transport capacity has led to the backlog of passenger transport on the Sichuan River, grain transportation on the Yangtze River, and local specialties transportation along the coast, and passenger transport equipment is not perfect. Insufficient attention has been paid to improving the living conditions of employees. In the future, we should strengthen transportation organization work, strengthen ship technical management and increase navigation aids, improve waterways and navigation marks, strengthen political work, and ensure navigation safety from all aspects to eliminate major accidents. Pay attention to the transportation of key materials, improve passenger transportation equipment, and prevent the backlog of passenger and freight transportation. At the same time, we should gradually solve the problem of employee dormitories and necessary welfare facilities and improve the living conditions of employees according to the development of production.

    In the future, the shipping industry should pay special attention to the necessity of developing ocean shipping. According to the current development of China's industrial and agricultural production and the easing of the international situation, foreign trade will inevitably expand day by day. It is necessary to further open up overseas routes and develop ocean shipping. China is not only a continental country, but also a maritime country. The country's coastline is more than 12,000 kilometers long, and the coastal ports south of Dalian do not freeze all year round, and there are many deep-water ports, which are suitable for developing ocean shipping. The country's foreign trade is increasing year by year, and more than half of the import and export materials this year need to be transported by ocean shipping. It is necessary for us to start this work as soon as possible. Considering China's economic conditions, coastal natural conditions, and the international environment, it is entirely possible to gradually build a marine shipping industry with a considerable scale, and it is in line with the needs of current and future business development. At the same time, it is also necessary to consider and start planning the technical transformation and expansion of ports according to the needs of coastal and ocean shipping development.

    In the next twelve years, China's highways and inland river transportation will have great development. The dredging of various rivers, the construction of various highways, the opening of the Grand Canal, the construction of advanced highways, and the large increase in water and land transportation equipment are a huge long-term plan. The implementation of this huge plan depends on the support and leadership of the national strength, and especially on the enthusiasm and creativity of local areas and the masses of the people, so that the future long-term plan can soon become a reality. The economic conditions in various parts of China are different from each other. National leadership and construction should not only concentrate power, but also adapt to local conditions and give play to local flexibility. Properly solving the division of labor between the central government and local areas is the issue of improving the national system. This issue has not been resolved in Chinese history, but it can be resolved under the socialist system. In order to improve the national system, give play to the enthusiasm of the top and bottom, and accelerate socialist construction, the State Council has convened a system meeting, which is a very wise measure, and I fully support it. The transportation business has complex, diverse, and decentralized characteristics, and there are more issues in the division of labor between the central and local levels and between the upper and lower levels. We should also better classify and manage businesses and enterprises and improve the current planning and financial system so that the above can concentrate on strengthening leadership and overall planning, and the following can also carry out work with all their strength according to the established principles and policies.

    On the road to our business development, we must also pay special attention to scientific and technological research. The Ministry of Communications is establishing scientific research institutions for water transport and highways and carrying out work according to the long-term scientific research plan. First of all, study the technical transformation of water transport and highways in the future, study ship type design, study highway technical standards, summarize and promote various advanced experiences, learn from the new achievements of science and technology in various countries, especially fraternal countries, and use these new achievements in transportation in a planned way. In addition to natural sciences, we must also theoretically summarize the production management experience of transportation and capital construction and carry out research on departmental economic science. The current problem is to accelerate the training of talents and make full use of the existing technical force. Strengthen the leadership of intellectuals, make proper arrangements, and use them rationally.

    China's existing intellectuals and scientific and technological talents are far from enough, and the existing forces are very valuable. Many intellectuals, after several years of training and education by the Party and the state, have greatly improved their political awareness and enthusiasm for work, and a group of advanced elements have emerged. The state has fully understood, trusted, supported, and rationally arranged the work of many intellectuals, so that their talents have been brought into play and they have done a lot of work for the country, and some have made significant contributions. The current problem is to further strengthen leadership, provide necessary working conditions and reasonable living conditions. And all intellectuals should be fully understood and their work specifically arranged.

    In order to mobilize all forces to serve socialism, the state has called on overseas Chinese scientists, technicians, and students to return to the country as soon as possible, called on personnel scattered overseas to return to the country, and called on all personnel in Taiwan to return. This call has had a wide and profound impact overseas and in Taiwan. At present, the number of personnel returning to the country from overseas has greatly increased, and the number of personnel returning from Taiwan has also increased. After they returned, they were warmly welcomed and encouraged by the people of the motherland, and the state quickly arranged appropriate work for them and used their expertise. As everyone has seen in the newspapers, many well-known people have happily joined the work after returning to the country, such as Chen Rongjun, the navigation officer of the "Zhonghai" warship of the Chiang army, Li Wei, the engineer officer of the 302 warship, and Zhou Yuanning, a member of the Ordnance Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters of the Chiang army, who returned from Taiwan last year, have also been assigned to the Ministry of Communications to participate in the work according to the needs of the country and their interests. This example shows the concern of the motherland for all the good people in Taiwan. Their return will become useful talents for national construction. They should respond to the call made by the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: stand on the banner of patriotism, and together with the people of the motherland, strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and strive for the complete reunification of the motherland! All personnel in Taiwan and all transportation personnel, especially shipping personnel, should use their unique transportation conditions to resolutely and bravely bring transportation tools to the motherland to participate in socialist construction.

    Comrades! The work situation in all aspects over the past year shows that the work of various departments of the government has achieved results, and the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to build socialism has greatly increased. It is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Tensely completing this year's national plan is an extremely important key to completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The people of the whole country must make even greater contributions to this and strive to realize the great twelve-year long-term plan of the motherland!

    Long live the great Chinese people!
    Long live the socialist construction plan of the motherland!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the working class that lead us to advance towards socialism!

    交通部长章伯钧的发言
    交通运输部门在执行第一个五年计划中的新成就：全国公路通车总里程183，000公里——航运事业的新生产能力逐年增长——交通运输业的经济成份发生根本改变
    基本建设工作没有完全扭转被动局面——汽车运输力不足——对私营运输业的社会主义改造工作太慢——今后应该注意开展远洋运输——尤其要依靠地方和群众的积极性——建立水运和公路的科学研究机构——号召海外的中国科学家尽快回国
    我完全同意李先念副总理代表国务院所作的关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告。从去年的国家决算来看，工业利润增加，农业税收超额，在保证经济建设投资和文化教育需要的前提下，财政收支平衡。这证明厉行节约反对浪费的措施起了作用。今年的国家预算分配也是合理的，国营企业的社会主义积累已成为收入的主要来源。从支出预算看，52.22％用在经济建设，19.98％用于国防，12.74％用到文化教育方面，是符合我国人民和平建设愿望的。实现这个预算，是从财政上保障了我国人民提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划。全国人民都应当为实现这个和平建设的预算做出应有的努力。
    一年来，国家财政状况是令人满意的。不仅如此，更为满意的是国家为创造和平建设环境所采取的各项重要政治经济措施，已起了极为广泛深刻的影响和作用。和平共处的五项原则为更多的国家所接受，国际局势趋于缓和，对外贸易正在扩大。特别令人兴奋的是，我国社会主义革命进入高潮，取得了决定性的胜利，推动了各方面的工作，使国民经济和文化事业推向新的高涨。
    在我国国民经济的新高涨下，交通运输部门已掀起了群众性的社会主义生产高潮，广泛地开展了先进生产者运动，在执行第一个五年计划中取得了新的成就。
    五年计划规定中央投资的公路修建任务10，154公里，可以提前一年多时间完成。其中新建公路除了康藏和青藏公路外，像四川省从成都到阿坝的公路、青海省从西宁到玉树的公路、云南省从佛海到西澜沧和个旧到那法的公路，以及西藏地区从江孜到亚东和江孜到日喀则的公路都已完成通车。到今年四月，全国公路通车总里程达到183，000公里。在今后两年内还要继续增加新建公路，从新疆到西藏的公路就要开工。至于地方道路建设，由于广大农村群众有力地支持，正在迅速发展。今年一至四月修建了2，762公里的干线公路，17，748公里的简易公路， 39，388公里的大车道，1，804公里驮运道。随着公路通车里程增长，汽车运输任务大为增加。去年汽车货运周转量比前年增长了35％，今年又比去年增长31％。
    航运方面，去年江海运输超额完成计划，今年一至五月江海货运量完成计划104％。从目前情况看，五年计划规定的全国轮驳船运输指标可能提前完成。航运成本指标可能提前一年完成。它的可靠基础是劳动生产率不断增长，船舶使用效率提高了。去年沿海北洋航线和长江船舶效率比1952年提高40％—50％，长江拖轮效率提高244％。由于船舶使用效率提高以及燃料费用减低，促使了航运成本下降。国营江海运输成本比1952年降低40％多，因而又为降低运价提供了条件。今年年初我们已实行了新运价。这个新运价比1952年约降低三分之一。
    航运事业的新生产能力已经逐年增长，五年计划规定的船舶建设和港口建设可超额完成。除了前两年已经完成的进度外，去年江海运输已有132艘新船投入生产；重点建设的港口，新增吞吐能力130万吨；去年七月间国务院决定建设的湛江商港工程已在当年开工兴建，今年内除油码头和油库外，即可完成第一期工程，并正式开港。
    湛江商港建设是一项大工程，技术复杂。在中国历史上以自己的技术力量建筑这样一个现代化的海港还是第一次。这个海港的第一期工程任务完成以后，按照设计任务，吞吐能力将达到160万吨；可使吃水8.9公尺的万吨远洋海轮进港；基本上用机械进行货物装卸作业。
    大家知道，湛江商港是我国南部海岸的一个良好的深水港口，对于发展国际贸易特别是对发展东南亚各国贸易有重大的意义和作用。估计到今后对外贸易将更加频繁，为了便利进出口物资的扩大，更多地发挥湛江商港的效用，我们计划在今后第二期和第三期施工中，按照年吞吐能力460万吨要求继续进行建设，以迎接即将扩大的对外贸易业务。
    交通运输业的经济成份已经根本改变。到今年第一季度止，除私营轮船、汽车已全部纳入公私合营外，木帆船纳入合作化和定息合营的达81％，专业兽力车合作化达71％，人力车合作化达31％。
    当然，这些成就只是工作情况的一个方面。另一方面我们不能忽视迄今仍然存在的许多缺点。
    基本建设工作，迄今没有完全扭转测设落后于施工、管理赶不上劳动生产率增长的被动局面，以致窝工、返工很多，浪费很大，若干工程质量低。对于干线公路修建偏重沿海边疆，对华北平原缺乏注意。地方道路修建偏重数量忽视质量，某些地区使用民力缺乏计划，以致盲目修建。今后应加强基本建设的技术监督和技术设计力量；改进施工组织管理；注意干线公路合理分布；地方道路要更有计划地进行修建，注重道路质量，正确地贯彻民工建勤制度。
    公路运输方面，全国普遍感到汽车运力不足。主要问题是我国汽车数量过少，新车增加不多。过去尚可进行地区性的平衡，现在已难调剂。这个问题，除了各地继续提高车辆利用率和充分组织运用民间运输工具外，国家应在储备物资中掌握一定数量的后备车辆。在目前时期应当用补充车辆的办法平衡汽车运力。
    对于私营运输业社会主义改造工作，过去进行太慢。随着全国社会主义改造的胜利形势开展工作以后，基本上是健康的。但也有缺点，如在合营时，资产估价偏低，忽视非实职人员安排；合作社公积金留得过多等；有些地区贯彻政策不尽妥善。这一现象，现在已经扭转。主要是加强政策教育，深入检查，随时发现问题，随时解决。
    航运工作，由于船舶老旧，我们又忽视了技术管理；偏重数量指标，忽视了质量的提高；对航道航标以及船上安全设备和政治工作缺乏有机配合，以致运输质量差、事故多、运输不及时，航运运量增加，运力不足，川江客运、长江粮食运输和沿海土特产运输都有积压，客运设备也不完善。对于职工生活待遇改善注意不够。今后应加强运输组织工作，加强船舶技术管理和增加助航设备，改善航道航标，加强政治工作，从各方面保证航行安全，全力消灭重大的事故。注意重点物资运输，改善旅客运输设备，防止客货运输积压。同时应根据生产发展，逐步解决职工宿舍和必要的福利设施，改善职工生活待遇。
    今后航运事业应当特别注意到开展远洋运输的必要性。根据目前我国工业、农业生产发展以及国际局势缓和的情况看，对外贸易必将日益扩大，进一步开辟海外航线，发展远洋运输，已是必要的。我国不仅是大陆国家，而且是个海洋国家。全国海岸线长达12，000多公里，沿海港口自大连以南长年不冻，并且有许多深水港，适宜于开展远洋航运。国家对外贸易正在逐年上升，今年进出口物资中有半数以上需要通过远洋运输。我们就有必要及早动手开展这一工作。根据我国的经济状况和沿海自然条件以及国际环境考虑，逐渐建设一个具有相当规模的海洋航运事业是完全可能，并且是符合于当前与今后事业发展需要的。同时，还必须根据沿海和远洋运输发展的需要，考虑和着手规划港口的技术改造和扩建工作。
    在今后十二年内，我国公路和内河运输都将有很大的发展。各种河川的疏浚，各种公路的建设，大运河的开辟，高级公路的建筑，水陆运输设备的大量增加，是一个巨大的远景计划。这个巨大计划的进行，固然有赖于国家力量的支持和领导，尤其要依靠地方和人民群众的积极性和创造性，这才能使未来的远景很快地成为现实。中国各地经济状况互不一样。国家领导建设既应事权集中，又须因地制宜，发挥地方灵活性。妥善解决中央与地方的分工，就是改进国家体制问题。过去中国历史上没有解决过这个问题，但是在社会主义的制度下可以解决。为了改进国家体制，发挥上下积极性，加速社会主义的建设，国务院已经召开体制会议，这是十分英明的措施，我完全拥护。交通运输事业具有复杂、多样、分散的特点，中央与地方、上层与下层之间的分工问题也比较多。更应该很好的分级管理事业和企业，改进现行的计划、财务体制。使上面集中精力加强领导全面规划，下面也能根据既定的方针政策全力进行工作。
    在我们事业发展的道路上，还要特别注重科学技术的研究。交通部正在建立水运和公路的科学研究机构，根据科学研究远景规划开展工作。首先研究今后水运和公路的技术改造问题，研究船型设计、研究公路技术标准，总结和推广各种先进经验，学习世界各国特别是兄弟国家科学技术的新成就，有计划地把这些新成就用到交通运输事业上来。除了自然科学以外，还要从理论上总结运输和基本建设的生产管理经验，开展部门经济科学的研究。目前问题在于加速培养人才，充分运用现有的技术力量。加强对知识分子的领导，妥善安排，合理使用。
    我国现有的知识分子、科学技术人才是很不够的，现有的力量十分宝贵。许多知识分子经过几年来党和国家的培养教育，政治觉悟和事业积极性大为提高，涌现了一批先进分子。国家对许多知识分子进行充分了解、信任、支持和合理安排工作，使他们的才干得到发挥，为国家做了许多工作，有的已经做出重大的贡献。目前问题在于进一步加强领导，给予必要的工作条件和合理的生活待遇。并且要对一切知识分子都要加以充分了解，具体的安排他们的工作。
    为了调动一切力量为社会主义服务，国家已经号召海外的中国科学家、技术人员和学生尽快地回国，号召流散在海外的人员回国，号召一切在台湾的人员归来。这一号召已在海外和台湾起了广泛深刻的影响，目前从海外回国的人员大为增加，从台湾归来的人员亦复不少。他们回来以后，受到祖国人民热情的欢迎和鼓励，国家对他们很快地安置了适当工作，使用了他们的专长。大家已在报纸上看到，许多知名之士归国以后都愉快地参加了工作，即如去年从台湾归来的蒋军“中海号”军舰航海官陈荣钧、302号军舰轮机官李韦以及蒋军联勤总部兵工署组员周远宁等人，也都根据国家的需要和他们的志趣分派到交通部参加了工作。这一事例表明了祖国关怀在台湾的一切善良的人员。他们归来，都将成为国家建设有用的人才。他们应该响应中国人民政协二届全国委员会第二次全体会议的号召：站到爱国主义的旗帜下来，同祖国人民一起，争取和平解放台湾，为实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗！在台湾的一切人员以及一切交通人员，特别是航运人员，他们应该利用自己特有的交通条件，坚决地、勇敢地带同交通工具投向祖国，参加社会主义建设。
    同志们！一年来从各方面的工作情况表明，政府各部门的工作都有成绩，全国人民建设社会主义的积极性大为高涨，提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划是完全可能的。紧张地完成今年的国家计划则是提前完成五年计划极为重要的关键。全国人民都要为此做出更加巨大的贡献，为实现祖国伟大的十二年远景规划而奋斗！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    祖国的社会主义建设计划万岁！
    领导我们向社会主义进军的中国共产
    党和工人阶级万岁！
