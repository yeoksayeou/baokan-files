Welcoming Distinguished Guests Outside the Yangtze Estuary
By our reporters Ji Yin and Xi Ping

On the evening of the 19th, tens of thousands of lights on the rows of towering buildings along the Bund in Shanghai shone brightly. Various colored lights were strung together into luminous belts, reflected on the Huangpu River, creating an incomparably magnificent night scene. At this time, we followed the People's Navy East Sea Fleet's "Nanchang" ship, setting off to welcome the Soviet fleet at the mouth of the Yangtze River, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai for a visit tomorrow morning.

Dawn at sea comes especially early. A little after four o'clock, the horizon in the east revealed the first light of day, gradually turning red as the sun emerged from the sea. At this moment, news arrived that the Soviet fleet was not far from us. A group of us boarded a speedboat from the "Nanchang" and headed east towards the rising sun to greet the Soviet fleet first. The wind picked up at sea, and the small boat was tossed violently, with large splashes of waves flying onto the gunwale. We held onto the swaying railings, using binoculars or shading our eyes with our hands, searching the eastern horizon. Soon, someone shouted, "Here they come! Here they come!" Sure enough, three black dots appeared on the water's surface in the northeast direction, gradually becoming larger and larger. Soon, the outlines of warships vaguely appeared. Our small boat erupted with excitement. People who had been vomiting from the tossing crawled out of the cabin, and sailors quickly lined up along the side of the boat. Colored international signal flags were raised on the mast: "Welcome! Congratulations on your successful arrival!"

The Soviet flag was raised on the top of the "Nanchang" ship in the nearby sea, followed by colorful signal flags. The ship's salute guns fired, booming seventeen times in a row. This was the sound of peace and friendship, offering the warmest greetings to friends from Vladivostok. The Soviet cruiser also fired seventeen salute guns in response. The sound of cannons and signal flags tightly connected the thousands of hearts of people from Vladivostok and the banks of the Huangpu River.

Our speedboat and another one successively approached the Soviet cruiser "Dmitry Pozharsky." Leading the way were Major General Peng Deqing, Deputy Commander of the East Sea Fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and liaison officers. As they held onto the ship's ladder to go up, Major General Petrov, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, immediately took them to see Vice Admiral V.A. Chekurov, Commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet.

"I represent the leaders of the East Sea Fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to welcome you," said Major General Peng Deqing. "I wish you a safe journey, and the people of Shanghai warmly welcome your visit!"

"We deeply appreciate the warm hospitality of the Chinese people," said the robust Vice Admiral Chekurov, shaking Major General Peng Deqing's hand tightly.

Soviet officers from the cruiser accompanied us through layers of rooms (the entire cruiser was like a high-rise building with dozens of floors) to a magnificent and spacious lounge. Many Soviet officers rushed over, and many greeted us enthusiastically in newly learned Chinese: "Comrade, hello!" The officers told us that in preparation for their visit to China, the Soviet fleet had launched a wave of learning about China. The ship held picture exhibitions introducing China, propagandists gave reports to the sailors on Chinese issues, and the ship's newspaper published special issues introducing China and Shanghai. Everyone on the ship was learning Chinese and understanding the customs of the Chinese people. The sailors cleaned the ships again and again, hung up slogans, and prepared to receive visitors from Shanghai.

"Our sailors got up before dawn today, and they thoroughly cleaned the ships again," Vice Admiral Chekurov told us. "We are deeply moved by the friendship of the Chinese comrades, and we must respond with the same friendship. Every member of our crew is happy to be able to visit China."

The loudspeakers announced that the fleet had approached the Wusongkou (the mouth of the Wusong River), and people rushed out, lining up along the side of the ship. Now the "Nanchang" was in the lead, the Soviet cruiser in the middle, and two torpedo destroyers in the rear, sailing towards Wusongkou.

As the hands of the clock pointed to twelve o'clock, the flag of the People's Republic of China was raised on the cruiser, and the salute guns fired again. This time it was twenty-one guns, the most solemn courtesy in the navy. The Soviet Navy expressed its greatest respect and friendship to the People's China. Plumes of white smoke rose from the Wusongkou shore, followed by twenty-one salute guns, as the Chinese people returned the same respect to the Soviet fleet.

The fleet slowly sailed along the Huangpu River. From the cruiser, one could see colorful flags fluttering on the river and crowds of welcoming people standing on both banks. Merchant ships sailing on the river sounded their horns in salute, and the sound of firecrackers and drums on the shore filled the air. The cruiser played "Moscow-Beijing" over and over again, and the entire ship shouted "Long live the People's Republic of China!" The waves of peace and friendship reverberated on the Huangpu River.

    长江口外迎贵宾
    本报记者　季音　习平
    十九日晚上，上海外滩一排排高耸的大楼上万灯齐明，各色灯光串成了一条条发光的带子，倒映在黄浦江上，构成了一幅瑰丽无比的夜景。这时候，我们随着人民海军东海舰队的“南昌”号，出发到长江口外迎接明天上午就要来到上海访问的苏联舰队。
    海上的黎明来得特别早，四点多钟，东边水平线上就露出了曙色，渐渐地转成红色，太阳从海水里涌上来了。这时传来了消息，苏联舰队已经离我们不远了。我们一群人，从“南昌”号搭上了一条快艇，迎着初升的太阳向东方驰去，先去迎接苏联舰队。海上起了风，小艇颠簸得厉害，浪花大片地飞溅到船舷上，我们手扶着摇晃的栏杆，用望远镜，或者用手搭起凉篷，向着东方的水平线上搜索着。不久，不知是谁喊了一声：“来了！来了！”果然，在东北方向的水面上，出现了三粒黑点，渐渐地愈来愈大，不久便模糊地出现了军舰的轮廓。我们的小艇上沸腾了，被颠簸得呕吐的人们爬出了船舱，水兵们迅速在船舷边列起了队伍，船桅上冉冉地升起了彩色的国际信号旗：“欢迎光临，恭贺顺利到达！”
    附近海面上的“南昌”号舰顶上，升起了苏联国旗，随即又飘起了彩色信号旗。舰上的礼炮响了，轰轰地接连响了十七响，这是和平友谊的炮声，它在向来自海参崴的朋友致最亲切的敬礼。苏联巡洋舰上也响起了十七响答谢的炮声。一片炮声和信号旗帜，把来自海参崴和黄浦江边人们的几千颗心紧紧地连结起来了。
    我们和另一艘快艇先后靠拢了苏联巡洋舰“德米特里·波日阿尔斯基”号，走在前面的是中国人民解放军东海舰队副司令彭德清少将和联络员等人，当他们扶着船舷梯子上去的时候，苏军太平洋舰队少将参谋长彼得罗夫就立即带他们去见苏联太平洋舰队司令瓦·安·切库罗夫海军中将。
      “我代表中国人民解放军东海舰队首长前来迎接，”彭德清少将说：“祝你们路上平安，上海人民在热烈地欢迎你们的光临！”
      “深深地感谢中国人民的热情招待。”身体健壮的切库罗夫中将紧紧地握着彭德清少将的手说。
    巡洋舰的苏军军官陪着我们穿过了一层层的房间（整个巡洋舰就像是一座数十层高的大厦），到了华丽、宽敞的休息室。许多苏军军官都赶来了，好多人都用才学会的中国话热情地招呼：“同志，您好！”军官们告诉我们说，苏联舰队上为了访问中国，展开了学习中国的热潮，舰上举行着介绍中国的图片展览会，宣传员向水兵们作了关于中国问题的报告，舰上的报纸出了介绍中国和上海的专刊，舰上人人学中国话，了解中国人民的风俗习惯。水兵们一遍又一遍地打扫舰只，挂起了标语，准备接待上海人民参观。
    “今天我们的水兵天不亮就起来了，他们又彻底把舰只打扫了一遍；”切库罗夫海军中将对我们说，“我们为中国同志的友情深深地感动，我们一定要以同样的友情来回答，我们每个舰员都为能访问中国而高兴。”
    广播器报告舰队已驶近吴淞口，人们都涌出去，在船舷边排成了队伍。现在“南昌”号在前，苏联巡洋舰在中，两艘雷击舰在后，正向吴淞口驶去。
    时针指着十二点，巡洋舰上迎风升起了中华人民共和国国旗，礼炮又响了，这次是二十一响，它是海军中最隆重的礼节。苏联海军向人民中国表示最大的敬意和友情。吴淞口岸上冒起了一朵朵的白烟，随后稳稳地传来二十一声礼炮声，这是中国人民用同样的尊敬答谢苏联舰队。
    舰队沿着黄浦江缓缓地驶去。从巡洋舰上望去，只见江上五彩的旗帜缤纷，两岸站满着欢迎的人群。在江上航行的商船拉起了致敬的汽笛，岸上鞭炮声、锣鼓声响成一片……。巡洋舰上一遍又一遍地奏着“莫斯科—北京”，全舰的人喊着“中华人民共和国乌拉！”和平友谊的声浪震荡在黄浦江上。（附图片）
