    Yunnan Transports White Wax Scale Insects to Sichuan by Truck for the First Time
    (Our dispatch) Yunnan Province's first shipment of white wax scale insects transported by truck has safely arrived in Sichuan.
    Zhaotong, Ludian, Qiaojia and other places in Yunnan Province are rich in white wax scale insects, but these insects can only reproduce in Yunnan and cannot produce large quantities of white wax. In Sichuan, Guangxi and other provinces, a good white wax scale insect can produce more than ten catties of white wax each year, but these provinces cannot reproduce the insects. Therefore, Yunnan has to transport large numbers of white wax scale insects to Sichuan and other places every year. In the past, all transportation was done by manpower, which took at least half a month, affecting the production and reproduction of white wax scale insects. This year, truck transportation was used. During transportation, the drivers and escorts paid close attention to the temperature in the truck, the smoothness of the ride, etc., so that twenty trucks of white wax scale insects safely arrived in Sichuan, taking only three days.

    云南首次用汽车运白蜡虫到四川
    本报讯　云南省第一次用汽车运输的白蜡虫已经安全运到四川。
    云南省昭通、鲁甸、巧家等地盛产白蜡虫，但是白蜡虫在云南只能繁殖而不能大量产白蜡。在四川、广西等省，每年一只好白蜡虫可以产十斤以上的白蜡，但是这些省份又不能繁殖白蜡虫。因此，云南每年都要把大批的白蜡虫运往四川等地。往年全是用人力运输，最少也要半个月才能运到，影响了白蜡虫的生产和繁殖。今年改用汽车运输。在运输中，司机和护送的人随时注意车箱的温度、行车平稳等，使二十车白蜡虫安全的抵达四川，费时仅三天。
