    Rapid Development of Soviet Aviation
    Interview with Famous Soviet Aircraft Designer Yakovlev

    A recent issue of the Soviet "Propagandist's Handbook" published an interview with the famous Soviet aircraft designer Yakovlev. Here is a summary of the interview:

    In recent times, Soviet aviation has made great strides forward. Currently, the Soviet Air Force is equipped with jet aircraft. The aircraft are equipped with various sophisticated instruments that enable them to fly day and night under complex weather conditions.

    Overcoming the Heat Barrier, Mastering High-Altitude Flight

    Not long ago, Soviet aircraft designers had to strive to solve a very important problem, overcoming the so-called sound barrier. Now, the problem of the sound barrier has been successfully solved, and supersonic flight has been achieved.

    Secondly, a new and most important task is to overcome the heat barrier. The ever-increasing speed of aircraft causes increased friction between the aircraft and the air particles surrounding it. This friction generates extremely high heat on the surface of the aircraft, thus reducing the structural strength of the aircraft. For example, in high-speed flight, the plexiglass of the cockpit lights will melt, and the strength of duralumin structures will also be weakened. Therefore, new materials are needed that can maintain the strength of the aircraft without weakening under the high temperatures generated by the friction between air particles and the structure. The task is to overcome the difficulties generated at speeds of 2,500 to 3,000 kilometers per hour. There is no doubt that this "barrier" will also be overcome.

    Another most important issue facing Soviet designers is how to master high-altitude flight. There are also difficulties here. When flying at altitudes of 25 to 30 kilometers, the air is very thin and the temperature is very low, so special conditions must be created for the pilot's work. Normal air pressure must be maintained in the aircraft cockpit. To achieve this, there must be a strong structure for a tightly sealed cockpit. And in order to maintain a normal temperature in the aircraft at high altitudes, it is necessary to study some special structures that can supply the cockpit with sufficient heat and clean air.

    The Ideal of Long-Distance Flight Realized, Significant Achievements in Helicopter Manufacturing

    Soviet aircraft manufacturers have made considerable achievements in striving for long-distance flight. The Soviet Union has large aircraft equipped with multi-engine jet engines that can fly non-stop over very long distances. Moreover, the speed of these aircraft, which was considered a fantasy a few years ago, has now become a reality. The Tupolev-designed "Tu-104" aircraft is the latest achievement of Soviet engineering thought and a new development in world aviation. Neither the United States nor the United Kingdom has similar aircraft.

    Soviet designers are not only studying the manufacture of new trunk-line aircraft for passenger transport, but also continuously improving aircraft for transport, rescue, and agriculture. Aircraft have been manufactured for use in various sectors of the national economy.

    Soviet scientists and designers have achieved significant success in the technology of manufacturing helicopters. The Soviet Union has all necessary types and uses of helicopters. Among these helicopters are the smallest aircraft designed by Kamov with a single-person cockpit, the medium-sized helicopters designed by Mil, and the "Yak-24" twin-engine helicopter, which is so large that it is called a "flying boxcar." Its large cabin can carry four tons of cargo. This is the largest helicopter in the world. Foreign, especially American, designers' attempts to make similar aircraft have not yet been successful.

    Helicopters are increasingly being used in various fields of life. Helicopters are a particularly convenient means of transportation in places where it is not only impossible to use ordinary aircraft, but also difficult to use other means of transportation, such as mountainous areas, large forest areas, swamps, and the Arctic regions.

    Scientific design ideas all over the world are stubbornly researching the use of atomic engines in aviation. Here, the difficulty lies not only in the novelty of the task itself, but also in the characteristics of modern atomic engineering. At present, atomic engines are still too bulky, so people are stubbornly fighting to greatly reduce their weight and volume.

    Stubbornly Researching Atomic-Powered Aircraft, Striving to Automate Aircraft Equipment

    The use of atomic energy in aviation opens up unprecedented and promising prospects for us. The potential of atomic-powered aircraft is indeed endless. It can fly in the air for hundreds of hours without adding "fuel." The range of such aircraft is almost infinite.

    Automatons occupy an important position in the development of aviation. Automatons are a link without which further development in all technical fields, especially aviation, would be impossible.

    Modern aircraft equipped with a large number of radio aviation equipment, radio positioning equipment, and other equipment pose such a complex set of mechanisms that it is difficult for people to control this set of mechanisms without automatons. Automatons can not only reduce the workload of pilots, but also make such work more accurate.

    Designers are striving to simplify the very complex equipment in the cockpit with the help of automation and greatly reduce the number of components on the instrument panel. This allows the pilot to concentrate on the most important instruments that control the flight, while the control and coordination of all other secondary processes and actions that would distract the pilot are realized through mechanical devices.

### 苏联航空事业突飞猛进  苏联著名飞机设计师雅可夫列夫的谈话

    苏联航空事业突飞猛进
    苏联著名飞机设计师雅可夫列夫的谈话
    最近出版的一期苏联“宣传鼓动员手册”刊登了苏联著名飞机设计师雅可夫列夫的谈话。这里是这篇谈话的摘要：
    在最近一个时期，苏联的航空事业大大向前迈进了。目前，苏联空军已用喷气式飞机装备了起来。飞机上装设有各种完善的仪器，这些仪器使飞机能够在复杂的气象条件下日夜进行飞行。
    正在克服热度的障碍  掌握飞机的高空飞行
    不久以前，苏联飞机设计师还不得不努力于解决一项十分重要的问题，克服所谓声的障碍。现在，声的障碍问题已经顺利地解决了，已达到了超声速度的飞行。
    其次一个新的最重要的任务是克服热度的障碍。越来越增加的飞机的速度引起飞机和绕过它的空气粒子互相摩擦的加剧。这种摩擦使飞机表面发生极高的热，因而减少了飞机动力结构的坚固性。例如，在高速飞行中机舱灯的有机玻璃都会熔化，硬铝结构的坚固性也要减弱。因而就需要一些新的材料，这些材料能在空气粒子和结构互相摩擦而产生高温的条件下，不减弱飞机的坚固性。任务就是要克服这种在每小时二千五百公里到三千公里的速度下所产生的困难。没有疑问，这个“障碍”也会克服的。
    摆在苏联设计师面前的另一个最重要问题是如何掌握飞机的高空飞行。这里也有它的困难。在二十五公里到三十公里的高空飞行时，空气非常稀薄，温度也很低，因此必须为飞行员的工作创造特别条件。在飞机驾驶室内必须保持正常的气压。为了达到这点，必须有严密封闭的驾驶室的牢固结构。而为了使飞机在高空中保持正常的温度，就需要研究出一些能供给驾驶室以足够热量和干净空气的特别结构。
    远距离飞行理想已实现  制造直升飞机成就重大
    苏联的飞机制造者在争取远距离飞行方面已取得不小的成绩。苏联有装有多引擎喷气发动机的大型飞机，这种飞机能够在很长的距离中不着陆地飞行。而且，这种飞机的速度在几年以前还认为是一种妄想，而现在却已成为现实了。图波列夫设计的“Ty—104”式飞机是苏联工程界思想的最新成就，是世界航空事业中的新事物。不论在美国，也不论在英国，类似的飞机还没有。
    苏联的设计师不仅在研究客运用的新型干线飞机的制造，并且也对运输、救护、农业用的飞机进行不间断的改进。已制造了为国民经济各个部门使用的飞机。
    苏联科学家和设计师在制造直升飞机的技术方面获得了重大的成功。苏联有一切必要型式和用途的直升飞机。在这些直升飞机中有卡莫夫设计的机舱坐一个人的最小的飞机，有米尔设计的中型直升飞机以及因体积巨大而名为“飞行车厢”的“Як—24”式双引擎直升飞机。它的宽大机舱能装载四吨货物。这是世界上最大的直升飞机。外国的、特别是美国的设计师制类似的飞机的企图目前还没有成功。
    直升飞机已越来越多地在生活的各个不同的领域中采用了。在那些不仅不能利用普通飞机，而且也难于采用其他交通工具的地方，如山地、大森林区、沼泽地以及北极地区，直升飞机是一种特别便利的交通工具。
    全世界的科学设计思想都在顽强地研究着在航空事业中采用原子发动机。这里，困难不仅在于任务本身新颖，而且还在于现代原子工程的特点。目前，原子发动机仍然过于笨重，因此人们正在为大大减少它的重量和体积进行顽强的斗争。
    顽强地研究原子能飞机  努力使飞机设备自动化
    在航空事业中采用原子能，为我们打开了前所未有的、有很大发展前途的远景。原子能飞机的潜在力确是无穷无尽的。它可以在空中飞行数百小时而无需添加“燃料”。这种飞机的航程几乎是无限的。
    自动机在航空事业的发展中占有重要地位。自动机是这样一个环节，没有它，一切技术领域，特别是航空事业，就不可能进一步向前发展。
    装有极多的无线电航空设备，无线电定位设备以及其他设备的现代飞机提出了这样复杂的一套机构，以致使人不用自动机就很难控制这一套机构。自动机不仅能减轻飞行员的工作，而且能使这类工作更加准确。
    设计师正在竭力依靠自动化的帮助把驾驶室中十分复杂的设备简单化，并大大减少仪器板上构件的数量。这样就使飞行员能够集中注意力于那些控制飞行的最主要的仪器，而所有其余次要的，会分散飞行员很多注意力的过程和作用的控制和协调工作则通过机械装置来实现。
