　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: Since the evening of the 11th, it has been raining extensively from north to south in Zhejiang Province. Heavy rain and torrential rain have occurred continuously in the central and western regions, and river water has risen sharply. On the evening of the 12th, after heavy rain and torrential rain in eastern and western Zhejiang Province, the Puyang River, Jinhua River, Xin'an River and other rivers exceeded the warning water level one after another. Millions of farmers along the rivers worked overnight to protect the dikes and carry out emergency repairs.
　　On the afternoon of the 13th, the rain stopped and the sky cleared in the northern, eastern, and western regions of Zhejiang, and the river water began to recede. However, the water levels of the Puyang River and other rivers are still above the warning water level, and the work of protecting the dikes and carrying out emergency repairs is still in full swing.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 13: In early June, continuous torrential rains in northwestern Hubei caused the first flash flood this year. The flash flood was very strong. The water level at the Huanglongtan Station on the Du River rose sharply by more than nine meters on the 8th. The upper reaches of the Yun River and the Gun River approached the extraordinarily large flood level of 1954. Thanks to the early preparations made in various places, no serious disaster has occurred. More than 80% of the wheat in the areas along the rivers has been harvested. Now, the farmers on both sides of the river are actively preparing to overcome even greater flash floods.

    据新华社杭州电　十一日晚间以来，浙江全省由北到南普遍下雨，中部和西部地区连续出现大雨和暴雨，河水猛涨。十二日晚，浙江省东部西部大雨暴雨以后，浦阳江、金华江、新安江等河流先后超过警戒水位。沿江两岸千万农民连夜护堤抢险。
    十三日下午，浙江北部、东部、西部地区雨停转晴，河水开始下降。但是，浦阳江等河流水位仍在警戒水位以上，护堤抢险工作仍在紧张进行。
    据新华社武汉13日电　六月上旬，鄂西北连日暴雨，出现了今年第一次山洪。山洪来势很猛，堵河黄龙滩站八日水位陡涨九公尺多。溳水、滚河上游接近1954年的特大洪水位。由于各地已经早作准备，没有形成严重灾害，沿河地区80％以上的小麦，都已经抢收到手。现在，沿河两岸农民正在积极准备战胜更大的山洪。
