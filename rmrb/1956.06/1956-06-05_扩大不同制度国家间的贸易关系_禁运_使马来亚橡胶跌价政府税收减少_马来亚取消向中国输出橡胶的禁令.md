Expanding Trade Relations Between Countries with Different Systems

“Embargo” Causes Malayan Rubber Prices to Fall, Government Tax Revenue Decreases

Malaya Lifts Ban on Rubber Exports to China

Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: According to a Reuters report from Kuala Lumpur: The government of the Federation of Malaya announced on June 4th the lifting of the ban on rubber exports to China.

A brief government statement issued in Kuala Lumpur said that "appropriate quantities" of rubber can now be exported to China. The statement also said: "The government will consider applications for special export licenses for rubber."

The Singapore government also issued a similar statement.

Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: Kuala Lumpur News: The price of Malayan rubber has fallen from one Malayan dollar per pound to more than seventy cents in the past few weeks, which has caused great panic among small producers.

According to a United Press report, the Malayan government planned to receive an average of more than 13 million yuan per month from rubber export taxes in the 1956 budget, which was based on an estimated selling price of one yuan per pound. Economic experts predict that if prices continue to maintain the current level of more than seventy cents per pound, the Federation of Malaya government will have a deficit of approximately 100 million yuan by the end of this year.

Small plantation owners who have suffered the most from the rubber price decline have requested the Rubber Producers Association to study this issue with the authorities. The Chairman of the Association, Campbell, said on the 2nd, "We hope to have the widest possible rubber market."

    扩大不同制度国家间的贸易关系
    “禁运”使马来亚橡胶跌价政府税收减少
    马来亚取消向中国输出橡胶的禁令
    新华社4日讯　据路透社从吉隆坡报道：马来亚联合邦政府六月四日宣布了取消不准向中国输出橡胶的禁令。
    在吉隆坡发表的一篇简短的政府声明说，现在可以向中国输出“适当数量”的橡胶了。这项声明又说：“政府将考虑要求发给出口橡胶的特别许可证的申请。”
    新加坡政府同时也发表了一篇类似的声明。
    新华社3日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚橡胶价格在过去几个星期当中从每磅马来亚币一元跌到七角多，这使得小生产者非常恐慌。
    据合众社报道，马来亚政府在1956年的预算中计划从橡胶出口税中每月平均收入一千三百多万元，这是根据估计每磅售价一元计算出来的。经济专家们预料，如果价格继续维持现在每磅七角多的水平，马来亚联合邦政府到今年年底将有大约一亿元的赤字。
    因橡胶跌价而受损失最重的小种植业主已经要求橡胶生产者协会同当局研究这个问题。协会主席坎贝尔二日表示，“希望有尽量广大的橡胶市场”。
