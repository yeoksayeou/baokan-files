    Holds Exhibition of Members' Production and Business Reports
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Hangzhou Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association recently held an exhibition of production and business reports from its industrialist and businessman members.
    The exhibition, through more than 200 items of objects, texts, and illustrations on display, reflected the progress made by the majority of industrialists and businessmen in Hangzhou after accepting socialist transformation. Yu Xiuzhang, the former manager of Hu Qing Yu Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store, was appointed by the government as the deputy manager of the state-owned Hangzhou Pharmaceutical Company. In order to improve his business, he personally went to Shaoxing County and Jianqiao District near Hangzhou to organize sources of goods and investigate the distribution of the commercial network. He has recently been promoted to manager. Xu Chunquan, a private-sector employee working as a cashier in the joint state-private Zhejiang Enterprise Company, has not made a single mistake for fifty-two consecutive months. Zhu Yaohui, a private-sector employee who is the director of the first wholesale department of the Hangzhou Department Store, has consistently been active and responsible in his work. Under his leadership, the first wholesale department fulfilled its competition plan in April and May, won the Red Banner of Excellence, and he personally received bonuses three times in a row. Their deeds were all exhibited at the exhibition.
