I listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, and I also listened to Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives. I fully agree with these two reports and suggest that the assembly approve them.

In the past extraordinary year, our country has undergone a fundamental change, most notably in the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the full-scale unfolding of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the Chinese people are marching forward with soaring labor enthusiasm and full confidence towards the bright road of socialism and communism.

Due to the above situation, our country's industrial production has lagged far behind actual needs. Therefore, the rapid development of national industrial production has become the most urgent task at present. We need to make the greatest efforts to catch up and achieve mutual balance and coordination, so that our country's socialist construction can be completed as soon as possible.

I am a steel factory designer, so I would like to talk about the development of China's steel industry.

To increase China's steel production, increase varieties, and improve quality to meet the needs of national industry, agriculture, and people's daily life, roughly three methods can be used to achieve this:

1.  Reconstruct old enterprises and tap their potential. This is the fastest and most effective method. The Soviet Union has accumulated rich experience in this area. Strengthening equipment and factory buildings, improving operating methods, rationalizing labor organization and management, adopting advanced technologies, and fully unfolding the rationalization proposal movement play a decisive role in increasing production and improving quality. We should learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in this regard to solve the difficult problems we currently have and urgently need to solve. This can be said to be an emergency solution.

2.  Build new steel bases. This is a fundamental method, especially in China, a country with an extremely backward steel industry and a thin foundation. Using the first method to tap potential is ultimately limited and cannot achieve large-scale production increases. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to build large-scale steel enterprises. However, because construction takes a long time, requires large investments, and does not take effect immediately, it cannot be used as an emergency solution but is a long-term plan.

3.  Import steel from other countries. This is also an emergency solution, because the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, although willing to provide us with fraternal and benevolent enthusiastic help, are all busy building their socialist and communist societies. Increasing their steel exports will delay their construction progress, which is not beneficial to strengthening the entire socialist democratic camp. Therefore, this method should only be used as a last resort and should be limited to a small number of high-quality steels and special steels.

Looking at the above three methods, I think the three should be used in coordination to solve the problem. This way, we can both plan for the long term and solve current difficulties.

When reconstructing old enterprises, I don't think it is advisable to make too many changes. We should only focus on modifying the unreasonable parts on the original basis and try our best to tap potential. Only in this way can we achieve less investment, faster construction, and immediate results, achieving the purpose of emergency relief. If everything is renovated, this goal cannot be achieved no matter what, and it is fundamentally little different from new construction.

When building new steel enterprises, preparation work should be done first, such as resource exploration, site selection, basic data collection, variety determination, equipment customization, and building material preparation. We must also make designs step by step and carry out construction according to the design. Only in this way can we be orderly. Experience tells us that if we do not do this, not only will we not be able to advance the progress, but we will delay it instead.

In the process of building China's steel industry, there are still many difficulties. Now I will only raise a few points that need to be solved.

1.  Lack of design data and equipment data. In our design work, often because design data and equipment data cannot be collected in time or cannot be collected at all, the design work cannot continue and is forced to stop. Sometimes, in order to rush the work, we have to work without reliable data, resulting in losses and delays. Therefore, the sorting, exchange, management, and collection of data is one of the important conditions for promoting construction work.

2.  Equipment cannot be supplied in time. In the construction of the steel industry, there is a particularly large need for heavy machinery and electrical equipment. At present, the domestic manufacturing capacity for this type of equipment is still very poor, making the supply of equipment extremely difficult. Therefore, strengthening the manufacturing capacity of heavy machinery and electrical equipment is also one of the important factors in accelerating the development of the steel industry.

3.  Insufficient training of design forces. The design work of steel factories is extremely complex and meticulous. Designers must have rich scientific knowledge and practical experience. Although we are now able to design some small-scale simple steel plants, there are still many difficulties. It is unimaginable without Soviet experts. For the design of large and complex steel plants, we dare not try lightly and still have to trouble the Soviet elder brother to design and supply equipment for us. Therefore, actively training design forces and improving design levels and quality is also an extremely important task.

4.  Timely exploration of resources. Now the construction task of the steel industry is very heavy, but in the design work, we still feel that the resource data is insufficient, and the strength of resource exploration cannot keep up with the needs. Therefore, strengthening the resource exploration force is urgent.

In the past year, China's steel industry has made amazing improvements and progress in terms of output, variety, quality, and technology, but it still cannot meet the needs of the country's highly developed industry and agriculture. The task of our technical staff engaged in the steel industry is extremely glorious and extremely arduous. We must continuously enrich our scientific knowledge and work experience in practical work training, guide our work with the Marxist-Leninist philosophical worldview, and with the continuous and kind care and help of the Party and the government, I believe that we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties to complete the glorious task assigned to us by the state.

### 我国钢铁工业的发展问题——夏以焜代表

    我国钢铁工业的发展问题
    ——夏以焜代表
    我听了李先念副总理所作的关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，同时又听了廖鲁言部长所作的关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程的说明，我完全同意这两个报告并建议大会予以通过。
    在过去的不平凡的一年中间，我们的国家起着一个根本的变化，最显著地表现在农业合作化高潮的到来和私营工商业的社会主义改造的全面展开，我国人民在党和政府的正确领导下，正以高涨的劳动热情满怀信心地向着社会主义和共产主义的光明大道迈步前进。
    由于以上情况的存在，我国的工业生产已远远地落后于实际的需要，因此国家工业生产的迅速发展已成为目前最迫切的任务，需要我们作出最大的努力，迎头赶上，使彼此互相平衡和配合，使我国的社会主义建设早日完成。
    我是一个钢铁工厂的设计工作者，所以想谈一谈我国钢铁工业的发展问题。
    要提高我国钢铁的产量、增加品种和改进质量，来满足国家工农业和人民日常生活的需要，大抵可以用三种办法来实现：
    1、改建旧企业并挖掘其潜力。这是一种最快并最有效的办法，苏联对这方面的工作，积有丰富的经验，设备和厂房的加固，操作方法的改善，劳动组织和管理的合理化，先进技术的采用，合理化建议运动的全面展开，对产品的增加和质量的提高，起着决定性的作用，我们应该学习苏联在这方面的先进经验，来解决我们目前存在的而且急切需要解决的困难问题，这可以说是一种救急的办法。
    2、新建新的钢铁基地。这是一种基本的办法，尤其在我国是一个钢铁工业异常落后的国家，底子太薄，用第一种办法来挖掘潜力，到底有限，不能得到大量的增产，因此根本的解决办法是新建大规模的钢铁企业，但由于建设时间长，投资大，而且不能立时生效，所以不能用来救急而是一种长远的计划。
    3、由其他国家输入钢铁。这也是一种救急的办法，因为苏联和各人民民主国家，他们虽然愿意对我们作兄弟般和善意的热情帮助，但他们都正在忙于建设他们的社会主义社会和共产主义社会，加多了他们的钢铁输出量就会推迟他们的建设进度，这对加强整个社会主义民主阵营力量的意义来讲是没有好处的，所以只有在不得已的时候才采用这个办法，并应限于少数的优质钢材和特种钢材。
    以上面的三种办法来看，我觉得要三种同时配合使用，才能解决问题，这样才既能作长远打算又能解决目前困难。
    在改建旧企业的时候，我觉得不宜改动太大，只能就原有的基础上将不合理的地方重点修改并尽量设法挖掘潜力，这样才能做到投资少、建设快，可以立时见效，达到救急的目的，如全部翻新，则无论如何不能达到这个目的，与新建根本上很少区别。
    在新建钢铁企业时，要先做好准备工作，如资源的勘测，厂址的选择，基础资料的收集，品种的决定，设备的定制和建筑材料的准备，并要按步地做出设计，按照设计进行施工，这样才能有条不紊。经验告诉我们，若是不这样做，非但不能提早进度，结果反而推迟。
    建设我国钢铁工业的过程中，现在还存在着不少的困难，现在只提出几点，需要设法加以解决。
    1、设计资料和设备资料的缺乏。我们在设计工作中，往往因为设计资料和设备资料的不能及时收集或无法收集，使设计工作不能继续而被迫停工，有时因为赶工而不得不在没有可靠资料的情况下工作，结果造成损失并推迟进度，所以资料的整理、交流、管理和收集，是推进建设工作的重要条件之一。
    2、设备的不能及时供应。在钢铁工业的建设中，需要重型机电设备特别多，现在国内对这种器材的制造力量还很差，使设备的供应，发生极大的困难，所以加强重型机电设备的制造力量，也是加速发展钢铁工业的重要因素之一。
    3、设计力量的培养不够。钢铁工厂的设计工作，是极为复杂细致，设计人员要具备丰富的科学知识和实际经验，现在我们虽已能做些小规模简单钢铁厂的设计，但是困难还是很多，离开了苏联专家是不能想像的，对于大型复杂的钢铁工厂的设计，更不敢轻于尝试，还要全部麻烦苏联老大哥替我们设计并供应设备，所以积极地培养设计力量，提高设计水平和质量，也是一项极重要的工作。
    4、资源的及时勘探。现在钢铁工业的建设任务非常繁重，但在设计工作中还感到资源资料的不足，资源勘探的力量还赶不上需要，所以加强资源勘探力量是刻不容缓的。
    在过去的一年内，我国的钢铁工业，无论在产量上、品种上、质量上以及技术上，都是有了惊人的提高和进步，但仍不能适应国家工农业高度发展的需要，我们从事钢铁工业的技术工作人员的任务是极其光荣并且也是极其繁重的，我们要在实际的工作锻炼中不断地丰富我们的科学知识和工作经验，以马列主义哲学的宇宙观来指导我们的工作，在党和政府的不断的亲切关怀和帮助下，我相信我们一定能够克服一切的困难来完成国家给予我们的光荣任务的。
