This dispatch from Changsha, June 2nd reports: Various counties in the Xiangtan Special District, Hunan Province, are taking measures to overcome the blindness of agricultural production cooperatives in diversified operations.

Eighty percent of the cooperatives in this area have launched diversified operations, but due to the blind production of some agricultural cooperatives, confusion such as products not finding markets has occurred. For example, in the Twelfth District of Liuyang County, nine cooperatives were firing bricks and tiles, but because it is not currently the season for farmers to build houses, bricks and tiles worth more than 6,000 yuan have been stockpiled. In addition, due to the lack of overall planning, many agricultural cooperatives are competing to sign contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives and warehouses, often creating disunity among the cooperatives, making it impossible for some cooperatives to realize their plans.

In order to reverse this tendency, the Sifen District of Liling County recently convened a meeting of relevant departments to comprehensively arrange the sideline production of agricultural cooperatives based on production and sales conditions. Agricultural cooperatives in the Mingyue District of Xiangyin County have established contact with supply and marketing cooperatives and are conducting sideline production according to sales channels. The Cooperative Production Office of the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently synthesized 158 sideline production items from various locations and provided opinions on whether or not they can be vigorously operated, for the reference of each county's leadership in developing diversified operations of agricultural cooperatives.

    湘潭专区克服副业生产中的盲目性
    本报长沙2日电　湖南省湘潭专区各县正在采取措施，克服农业生产合作社在多种经营中的盲目性。
    这个地区已有80％的社开展多种经营，但由于部分农业社盲目生产，曾发生产品找不到销路等混乱现象。如浏阳县十二区有九个社烧砖瓦，但因现在不是农民修盖房屋的季节，就积压了价值六千多元的砖瓦。此外，由于没有统筹规划，许多农业社争着和供销合作社及仓库订合同，往往造成社与社的不团结，使一部分社的计划不能实现。
    为了扭转这种偏向，醴陵县泗汾区最近召开了各有关部门的会议，根据产销情况，全面布置农业社的副业生产。湘阴县明月区的农业社已与供销社建立联系，根据销路进行副业生产。中共湘潭地委合作生产办公室，最近综合各地158项副业生产，并分别提出是否可以大力经营的意见，供各县领导农业社开展多种经营时参考。
