    The United States Must Fulfill the Agreement on the Issue of the Return of Civilians

    Recently, families of students studying in the United States across the country have been requesting the government to negotiate with the U.S. government, demanding that the U.S. fulfill the agreement reached during the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks on the issue of the return of civilians, so that their loved ones can return to the motherland and reunite with their families as soon as possible. Their demands are completely legitimate.

    Since the Sino-U.S. talks reached an agreement on the issue of the return of civilians, some Chinese students studying in the U.S., after being obstructed from returning to their country for a long time, have finally returned to the motherland. However, the vast majority of students studying in the U.S. have still not been able to return home without obstruction. The U.S. government's long-standing obstruction of Chinese students, preventing them from returning to their country, has in itself already created some practical difficulties for their current return; and after the agreement was reached, the U.S. government not only did not take appropriate measures to assist them in returning to their country in accordance with the agreement, but instead continued to create new obstacles. The U.S. Immigration Bureau has adopted various shameless means to force Chinese students to apply for permanent residence in the United States and to force them to obtain Taiwan entry permits, attempting to prevent them from daring to request to return to their country. The Chinese government has lodged solemn protests against these measures taken by the U.S. side that violate the agreement, but these measures have not yet been rescinded. Recently, according to reports from Chinese students who recently returned from the U.S., the U.S. government has again adopted the method of not issuing exit passports for children born to Chinese students in the U.S. to create difficulties. This is a serious violation of the agreement.

    The Chinese side has consistently strictly abided by the agreement; all ordinary American expatriates in China can leave the country at any time, and the Chinese government has also provided various forms of assistance to American expatriates who request to leave the country. This is something that the U.S. government cannot deny. The U.S. government keeps saying that there are still thirteen American prisoners imprisoned in Chinese prisons, as if Americans who break the law can disregard Chinese legal procedures and leave the country at will, while innocent Chinese expatriates and students cannot exercise their right to return to their country without obstruction. Indeed, there are thirteen American prisoners who are serving sentences for violating Chinese laws. Their cases must be handled in accordance with Chinese legal procedures. Moreover, even for Americans who break the law in China, the Chinese government has repeatedly taken lenient measures based on their crimes and their performance during their sentences, releasing them early and deporting them. On the other hand, the U.S. government has consistently refused to provide the Chinese side with information about Chinese people imprisoned in the United States, and has not taken any appropriate measures for them. Not only that, but the U.S. State Department spokesman also publicly stated on May 25 that Chinese people imprisoned in the United States will not be released. It seems that, in the U.S. government's view, the agreement between the two sides can be unilaterally and arbitrarily interpreted by it, while it itself can be free from any constraints. This unreasonable attitude can only be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to undermine the agreement between the two sides.

    The various actions of the U.S. side that violate the agreement cannot but arouse great indignation among the Chinese people. The Chinese people firmly demand that the United States must fulfill the agreement on the issue of the return of civilians.

### 美国必须履行双方平民回国问题的协议

    美国必须履行双方平民回国问题的协议
    最近，全国各地的留美学生家属纷纷请求政府向美国政府交涉，要求美国履行中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题的协议，使他们的亲人能够早日回到祖国同家人团聚。他们的要求是完全正当的。
    自从中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成协议以来，一部分中国留美学生，在回国长期受到阻难以后，终于回到了祖国。但是，绝大部分的留美学生至今还没有能够不受阻挠地回国。美国政府多年以来留难中国学生，不准他们回国，这本身就已经造成了他们当前回国中的一些实际困难；而在协议达成以后，美国政府不仅没有按照协议采取适当的措施协助他们回国，却反而不断地制造新的阻难。美国移民局采取了种种无耻的手段，强迫中国学生申请在美国永久居留，并且强迫他们取得台湾入境证，企图使他们不敢要求回国。中国政府对于美方这种种违反协议的措施，已经提出了严正的抗议，但是，这些措施却至今还没有取消。最近，根据不久前回国的中国留美学生的报道，美国政府对于中国学生在美国生育的子女又采取了不发给出国护照的办法来进行留难。这是严重违反协议的行为。
    中国方面一贯严格遵守协议，所有在中国的一般美国侨民都可以随时离境，中国政府并且还给予了要求离境的美侨以种种的协助。这是美国政府也不得不承认的。美国政府口口声声说，还有十三名美国犯人被监禁在中国的监狱中，仿佛犯法的美国人倒是可以不顾中国的法律程序随意离境，而无辜的中国侨民和留学生却不能不受阻挠地行使回国的权利。的确，是有十三名美国犯人，由于违犯了中国的法律，正在服刑。他们的处理必须按照中国的法律程序。而且，就是对于在中国犯法的美国人，中国政府也按照本人的罪行和在服刑期间的表现，一再采取了宽大的措施，提前予以释放和遣送出境。另一方面，美国政府却始终拒绝向中国方面交代被监禁在美国的中国人，更没有对他们采取任何适当的措施。不仅如此，美国国务院发言人在五月二十五日还公然声称，被监禁在美国的中国人将不予释放。似乎，在美国政府看来，双方的协议可以由它片面和任意地加以解释，而它自己却可以不受任何约束。这种横蛮无理的态度只能被解释为蓄意破坏双方的协议。
    美国方面违反协议的种种行为不能不引起中国人民的极大愤慨。中国人民坚决要求，美国必须履行双方平民回国问题的协议。
