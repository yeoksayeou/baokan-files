    Starting from the New Application of "Lacquer Art" in the United States
    Gu Fan

    Not long ago, a Western news agency published a piece of news saying that factory and store owners in the United States had come up with new ways to deal with female employees' fondness for chatting in the restrooms. Because, in Chicago, a "interior designer" named Karli made a new design: painting the walls of the restrooms red. It is said that after the restrooms are painted like this, female employees will feel uneasy and eager to leave when they enter, so they will no longer take advantage of the moment to relax their overly tense nerves.

    The news also said that employees in American enterprises like to look at the wall clock to see if it is time to get off work. So this "interior designer" from Chicago came up with another "design." According to him, as long as a green photo of the boss is painted in the middle of the clock face glass; green will make the employees feel uneasy when they look at it, and the boss's esteemed appearance will make no one dare to look at it for long.

    When a Hong Kong newspaper published this news, it called it "lacquer art." We will not care whether this kind of "lacquer art" is effective, but the "design" of this kind of "lacquer art" truly shows the extreme degree to which the cannibalistic crash-production system has developed in the "free world" of the United States.

    People know that "lacquer art" is just one of the hundreds of "arts" of exploitation, enslavement, and humiliation of laborers conceived by the "experts" raised by American monopoly capitalists. For example, in the United States, a so-called "psychological selection method" of employing workers is popular. According to this method, new workers are subjected to a "psychological selection" trick before starting work. That is, a committee composed of capital representatives and psychiatric experts calls the new workers to conduct arbitrary and sometimes insulting interrogations, asking everything from living habits to attitudes towards women. Some workers were asked nearly a hundred questions. The capital representatives and psychiatric experts try to find out his political beliefs and private life based on the new worker's answers in order to conduct "special supervision" of the new worker.

    Before the emergence of the "psychological selection method," American monopoly capital had already strictly selected workers in terms of physiological conditions, and in recent years it has intensified. In the United States, it is becoming increasingly difficult for men over the age of forty-five and women over the age of thirty-five to find jobs, because the tycoons think they are "too old." Many skilled middle-aged American men and women are turned away from the gates of factories and enterprises. They wander the streets, staring with hungry eyes at the news published in the newspapers that surplus agricultural products are causing trouble for the US government. As for older American workers, they are often trapped in poverty and helplessness. A letter written by an ordinary American person in an issue of "U.S. News & World Report" has such shocking sentences: "I am almost sixty years old. I wonder why the government does not kill all of us people of this age. It is more humane than starving to death." The experience of this old man is not an isolated case in the United States.

    Compared with this poor old man who has no way out, those workers who can pass the "physiological selection method" and "psychological selection method" tests of American monopoly capitalists are considered "lucky." But shrewd bosses are absolutely unwilling to let their employees have a slightly easier life. They extract as much blood and sweat as possible from each worker, and give as little as possible. According to statistics, an American worker needs to earn at least more than two dollars per hour to maintain the most basic life for a family of four, even if he has forty hours of work per week. However, the minimum wage per hour for American workers stipulated by the U.S. Congress is only one dollar. In fact, at present, about 20 million employees in the United States do not even enjoy this minimum wage. Many employees in the New York retail industry only earn 65 to 75 cents per hour. And the bosses still feel that it is intolerable for employees to chat in the restroom for two sentences, and they have come up with "lacquer art" to urge them on.

    Using "lacquer art" to restrict female employees from going to the restroom is certainly absurd and ridiculous, but it does paint an ugly picture of the capitalist system of people exploiting people, which helps people understand the American way of life.

### 从“漆术”在美国的新应用谈起

    从“漆术”在美国的新应用谈起
    古凡
    不久以前，西方通讯社发表了一则消息，说是美国的工厂、商店的老板们对于女职工喜欢在厕所谈天，已有了新的办法来对付。因为，在芝加哥，一个名叫嘉利的“室内装饰设计家”作出了新的设计：把厕所的墙壁涂成红色。据说，厕所经过这样油漆，女职工们走进去便会感到心神不安而急于离开，因而就不会再利用上厕所的片刻，让自己过度紧张的神经稍为松散一下了。
    消息还说，美国企业里的职工，喜欢瞧挂钟，看看是不是已到了下班的时间。于是这个芝加哥的“室内装饰设计家”作出了另外一种“设计”。据他说，只要在挂钟钟面玻璃的当中，漆上一张绿色的老板的照片；绿色会使职工们看着感到不安，加上老板的尊容，就更使谁也不敢多看。
    香港一家报纸刊登这则消息的时候，称它为“漆术”。我们且不管这种“漆术”是不是行之有效，但这种“漆术”的被“设计”出来，却千真万确地说明了：在“自由世界”的美国，吃人的赶工制度发展到了怎样登峰造极的程度。
    人们知道，“漆术”不过是美国垄断资本家豢养的“专家”们设想出来的千百种剥削、奴役和侮辱劳动者的“术”之一。例如，在美国，流行着一种雇用工人的所谓“心理选择法”。依照这个方法，新工人在开始工作前，要受到一番“心理选择”的捉弄。就是由资方代理人和精神病学专家组成的委员会，把新工人唤去恣意地进行有时是侮辱性的盘问，从起居习惯到对女人的态度，无所不问。有些工人竟被询问了近一百个问题。资方代理人和精神病学专家们，就根据新工人的答复，企图查明他的政治信仰和私人生活情况，以便对新工人进行“特别监督”。
    在“心理选择法”出现以前，美国垄断资本早就从生理条件方面对工人严加选择了，近年来更是变本加厉。在美国，四十五岁以上的男子和三十五岁以上的妇女，愈来愈困难找到职业，原因在于大亨们嫌他们的年纪“太老”。许多工作熟练的美国中年男女，被摈出工厂、企业的大门外，他们踯躅街头，用饥饿的眼睛盯着报上登载的剩余农产品给美国政府带来烦恼的消息。至于年纪更大的美国劳动者，更常常陷于贫困和无告的境遇中。登在一期“美国新闻与世界报道”上的一个美国普通人写的信中，有着这样触目惊心的句子：“我快六十岁了。我奇怪为什么政府不把我们这样年纪的人统统杀掉，这比饿死要人道得多。”这位老人的遭遇在美国还不是个别的。
    比起这位毫无生路的、可怜的老人来，那些能够通得过美国垄断资本家的“生理选择法”、“心理选择法”之类检验的工人们算是“幸运”的了。但是精明的老板们是绝不愿意让他雇佣的人们日子过得稍微轻松一些的。他们从每一个工人身上榨取尽可能多的血汗，而给得尽可能少。据统计，美国一个工人要维持四口之家的最普通的生活，即使他每星期有四十小时的工作可做，每小时的工资最少也要有二美元多。而美国国会规定的美国工人每小时的最低工资只有一美元。实际上，目前美国约有两千万名职工连这个最低工资的数额也享受不到，纽约零售业许多职工每小时的工资只有六角五分到七角五分。而老板们还感到，职工们要在厕所里聊上两句话也是不能容忍的，又想出“漆术”来驱策他们。
    以“漆术”之类来限制女职工上厕所，固然是十分荒唐无稽，但它倒的确是漆绘了一幅资本主义人剥削人的社会制度的丑恶图景，有助于人们了解美国的生活方式。
