Bidault's Cold Shoulder and Washington Politics

　　On the morning of June 19th, French Foreign Minister Bidault, accompanied by Senator George, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, walked into the U.S. Capitol Building. Foreign Minister Bidault was invited by the U.S. Senate to deliver a speech.

　　The French Foreign Minister entered the gate, unconsciously touched the prepared English speech of less than a hundred words in his coat pocket. As he walked, he thought: the ninety-six senators must have been waiting there for a long time. He couldn't help but feel a little apologetic.

　　Unexpectedly, when he stepped into the Senate meeting hall, he looked around and saw more than eighty of the hundred or so seats were empty. Only twelve senators stood up lazily and gave a few scattered applause, as a welcome to him.

　　Foreign Minister Bidault was wondering if he had the time wrong when Senator George calmly said: "Mr. Foreign Minister, let's rest for a while, the senators have not all arrived yet." He added, "Our constitution stipulates that the Senate cannot hold a meeting without a sufficient quorum."

　　Foreign Minister Bidault had to nod in agreement.

　　Half an hour passed. The French Foreign Minister looked around and counted the number of people; it was still twelve.

　　Another half an hour passed. The French Foreign Minister counted the number of people again; it was still a dozen. And two of them were already dozing off at their desks...

　　What to do waiting like this? There was a meeting scheduled with Secretary of State Dulles in two hours!

　　So, Senator George shrugged and said to Foreign Minister Bidault: "It looks like today's gathering is a bust. Let's go to lunch. Later, your speech can be printed and distributed to the senators, it's no different."

　　Foreign Minister Bidault helplessly followed Senator George out of the meeting hall.

　　A lavish lunch ended. Senator George sent the Foreign Minister to the door. When saying goodbye, Senator George said lightly: "This is very interesting and very pleasant."

　　On the way back, Foreign Minister Bidault took out his untouched speech from his pocket and read it in English with a French accent:

　　Mr. Speaker, Members of the United States Senate:

　　"I would like to express my gratitude to you for the honor you have given me, and through me to my country, by inviting me to say a few words in the United States Senate..."

　　Reading this, Foreign Minister Bidault couldn't help but reveal a bitter smile.

　　At this moment, a reporter ran into a Republican senator in a Washington exchange. The reporter asked the Republican senator a little strangely: "Why didn't you go to the parliament? Isn't Mr. Bidault going to give a speech today?"

　　"Don't you think Bidault, in his capacity as French Foreign Minister, has made too many presumptuous remarks? We just gave him a little something to think about." The Republican senator made a rude gesture with his thumb.

　　"You're absolutely right. However, I remember you listened to President Sukarno's speech in a crowded parliament and applauded him constantly. Are his words more pleasing to the ear than those spoken by Bidault?"

　　"That was unavoidable..." the senator replied.

　　"You mean, in relations with France, we can take advantage of Bidault's expressed loyalty to the alliance; but the independent actions of the Indonesian government require us to be more careful and show appropriate courtesy?"

　　"You're not an amateur when it comes to politics," the senator said, patting the reporter on the back with a smile.

### 比诺的冷板凳和华盛顿的政治

    比诺的冷板凳和华盛顿的政治
    六月十九日早晨，法国外交部长比诺在美国参议院外交委员会主席乔治的陪同下，走进了美国议会大厦。比诺外长是应美国参议院的邀请来发表演说的。
    法国的外交部长进了大门，无意识地摸了摸外衣的口袋中那一份准备好的不到一百字的英文演讲稿。他一边走一边想：九十六位参议员先生一定已经在那里久候了。心里不禁有点歉然。
    没想到当他跨进了参议院的会议厅，举目一望，却见一百来个座位空着八十多个。一共才只有十二位参议员懒洋洋地站起来发出了几声疏疏落落的掌声，算是对他表示欢迎。
    比诺外长正想，是否把时间弄错了，乔治参议员从容不迫地说：“外长先生，先休息一会罢，议员们还没有到齐哩。”他还补充道：“我们的宪法规定参议院没有足够的法定人数不能够开会。”
    比诺外长只好点了点头，表示同意。
    半点钟过去了。法国的外长先生用眼睛四周望了一下，数了数人数，仍然是十二位。
    又是半点钟过去了。法国的外长先生再数了数人数，依旧是一打。而且有两位已经伏在桌子上打瞌睡了。…………
    这样等下去怎办呢？两个钟头之后还有约定好同国务卿杜勒斯的会谈哩！
    于是，乔治参议员耸了耸肩对比诺外长说：“看样子今天的集会算是吹了。咱们去吃午饭吧。以后可以把你的演说词打印分发给参议员们，这并没有什么两样。”
    比诺外长无可奈何地跟着乔治参议员走出了会议厅。
    丰盛的午宴结束了。乔治参议员把外长先生送到了门口。在握别的时候，乔治参议员轻松地说：“这是很有兴趣而且是很令人愉快的。”
    在归途中，比诺外长从口袋掏出了他那原封未动的演讲稿，用带着法国口音的英语念道：
    议长先生，美国参议院各位议员：
        “我谨向诸位表示感谢诸位给我的荣誉，和通过我给我的国家的荣誉，邀请我在美国参议院说几句话。……”
      念到这里，比诺外长脸上不禁露出一阵苦笑。
                ＊　＊　＊
    正在这个时候，一位记者在华盛顿的一个交易所中碰到了一个共和党的参议员，那位记者有点奇怪地问共和党的参议员说：“你怎么没上议会去，今天不是比诺先生要去发表演讲吗？”
      “你不认为比诺以他的法国外长身份，已经发表了太多自作主张的话吗？我们不过是稍稍给了他一点颜色看看。”那位共和党参议员用大拇指作了一个粗野的手势。
      “你说得一点也不错。不过，我记得你们曾在拥挤的议会里倾听了苏加诺总统的演说，并且不断地报以掌声哩，难道他的话比比诺讲的那些还入耳些吗？”
    “那是不得已呀。……”参议员答。
      “你的意思是，在同法国的关系上，我们能够利用比诺所表示的它对联盟的忠诚；但是印度尼西亚政府的独立行动却使得我们要多加小心，表现适当的礼遇？”
    “你对政治可算不是个门外汉。”参议员拍拍记者的肩背笑着说。
