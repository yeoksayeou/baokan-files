Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 25th: Representatives of the Chinese Red Cross and representatives of three Japanese groups—the Japanese Red Cross, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee—today exchanged views in Tianjin on relevant issues. The Chinese Red Cross representatives also handed over 65 letters from Japanese war criminals to their families to the representatives of the three Japanese groups.

    The Chinese Red Cross representative, Ji Feng, gave the list of seven Japanese war criminals who had died of illness since 1954 to the representatives of the three Japanese groups, and explained that the ashes and belongings of these deceased had been transported to Tianjin, hoping that the representatives of the three Japanese groups would take them back to Japan. Ji Feng also said that the Chinese Red Cross, at the request of the three Japanese groups, had searched for a list, recorded by Japanese nationals themselves, of Japanese people who had died, and after extensive investigation and collection, had found a portion of it. It recorded the names and related information of more than 7,000 Japanese people who died in the Northeast region under the Kuomintang rule from 1945 to 1946.
