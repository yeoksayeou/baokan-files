    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 15th. According to an International News Service dispatch from Washington, the United States is consulting with the other fifteen countries that participated in the Korean War of aggression regarding the abrogation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    A U.S. Department of Defense spokesman pointed out in Washington on the 14th that when U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Reuben Robertson recently returned from the Far East, he said that the United States must "do something" this year about the issue of abolishing the Korean Armistice Agreement. The spokesman also revealed that the United States has long been creating "grounds" for formally abolishing the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    Robertson traveled to South Korea in mid-May. While in Seoul, he publicly clamored that "the armistice cannot continue indefinitely" and announced that "in the foreseeable future" there would be no further withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea.
    The United States' recent acts of violating the Armistice Agreement have emboldened the Syngman Rhee clique's war cries. Rhee Syngman told his troops on the 12th that "they should be prepared to fight at any time and in any place in the world that the United States needs them." The next day, Cho Jeong-hwan, the acting foreign minister of the Rhee Syngman government, also clamored that "war measures must be prepared" to extort the Korean and Chinese sides.
    At the same time, Syngman Rhee's Army Chief of Staff, Chung Il-kwon, reiterated his request on the 12th to equip the South Korean army with atomic cannons. He also requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Fifth Air Force be moved from Tokyo to South Korea. When Robertson was in Seoul, Robertson revealed that Washington was discussing a proposal to equip the South Korean army with new weapons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 16th. Seoul dispatch: The Chief of Staff of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in South Korea, John Kilgore, revealed on June 15th that the U.S. Department of Defense is planning to ship new weapons, including nuclear weapons, into South Korea. Four days prior to this, a U.S. State Department spokesman had denied that the United States had any plans to bring such weapons into South Korea.
    Kilgore, in a meeting with reporters from the Seoul "United News," said that, to his knowledge, he believed that senior officials in the U.S. Department of Defense were taking certain measures to replace the existing weapons of the U.S. military and the South Korean military in South Korea with weapons including atomic weapons.
    He also exposed the true purpose of the United States' plot to further undermine the Armistice Agreement after forcing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw from South Korea, because, as he said: with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission remaining in South Korea, "it would be difficult to supply the American troops and the Korean troops in Korea with atomic weapons unless the armistice agreement, which is still in effect, is modified."
    Kilgore also said: "All American soldiers are receiving atomic warfare training, and senior American officers stationed in Korea are being rotated to the United States to attend a recently established special training center." He said that he himself had completed training there, and the South Korean army had also been undergoing atomic warfare training for five or six months.

### 美国制造紧张局势阴谋废除朝鲜停战协定  李承晚集团的战争叫嚣跟着也高起来了

    美国制造紧张局势阴谋废除朝鲜停战协定
    李承晚集团的战争叫嚣跟着也高起来了
    新华社平壤15日电　据国际新闻社华盛顿消息透露，美国正在同其他十五个参加侵略朝鲜战争的国家磋商废除朝鲜停战协定。
    美国国防部的发言人十四日在华盛顿指出，美国国防部副部长卢本·罗伯逊最近从远东回来的时候说，美国今年对废除朝鲜停战协定的问题必须要作“一些事情”。这个发言人并且透露，美国早就在为正式废除朝鲜停战协定制造“根据”。
    罗伯逊在五月中旬曾经到南朝鲜活动，他在汉城时公开叫嚷“停战不能够无限期地延续下去”，并且宣布，“在可以预见的将来”将不再有美军撤出朝鲜。
    美国最近的破坏停战协定的行为，鼓动了李承晚集团的战争叫嚣。李承晚在十二日告诉他的军队说，“它应当准备好在美国需要它的任何时间和世界上任何地点进行战斗。”第二天，李承晚政府的代理外务部长官曹正焕也叫嚣“必须准备采取战争的办法”来向朝中方面进行讹诈。
    同时，李承晚的陆军参谋总长丁一权在十二日再次要求用原子大炮来装备南朝鲜军队。他还要求美国第五航空队总部从东京搬到南朝鲜来。当罗伯逊在汉城的时候，罗伯逊曾经透露，华盛顿正在讨论用新式武器装备南朝鲜陆军的建议。
    新华社平壤16日电　汉城消息：在南朝鲜的美国军事顾问团参谋长约翰·基洛戈尔六月十五日透露，美国国防部正在策划把包括核子武器在内的新武器运进南朝鲜。在这以前四天，美国国务院的发言人曾经否认美国有把这类武器运入南朝鲜的计划。
    基洛戈尔在接见汉城“联合新闻”记者的时候说，就他所知，他相信美国国防部的高级官员们正在采取某些措施来以包括原子武器在内的武器代替南朝鲜美军现有的武器。
    他还暴露了美国在强迫中立国视察小组撤出南朝鲜以后阴谋进一步破坏停战协定的真正目的，因为，如他所说：在中立国视察小组留在南朝鲜的情况下，“除非现在仍旧有效的停战协定得到修改，否则要供给朝鲜的美国军队和韩国军队以原子武器将是困难的。”
    基洛戈尔还说：“所有美国士兵都在接受原子战争的训练，驻在朝鲜的美国高级军官正被轮流派到美国去进最近创办的一个特别训练中心。”他说，他自己已经在那里受完训，南朝鲜的军队也已经进行了五六个月的原子战争训练。
