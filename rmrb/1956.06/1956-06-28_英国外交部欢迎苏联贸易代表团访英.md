Xinhua News Agency, London, June 27th. According to a Reuters report from London, the British Foreign Office announced on the 26th that a Soviet trade delegation would arrive in London soon to negotiate on the issue of increasing trade between Britain and the Soviet Union.

The British Foreign Office stated that it welcomes the arrival of the Soviet delegation.

The issue of holding trade negotiations arose from the volume of trade that the Soviet leaders indicated could be conducted between the two countries during their visit to Britain in April this year. At that time, they stated that if there were no trade discrimination, the Soviet Union would purchase £1 billion worth of goods from Britain in the next five years.

    英国外交部欢迎苏联贸易代表团访英
    新华社27日讯　据路透社伦敦消息，英国外交部在二十六日宣布，苏联贸易代表团最近就要到达伦敦，以便就增进英苏两国贸易问题进行谈判。
    英国外交部表示，它欢迎苏联代表团的到来。
    举行贸易谈判问题是由苏联领导人今年四月在访问英国时候表示过的两国可以进行的贸易额引起的，他们当时表示，如果没有贸易歧视，苏联在今后五年中就会向英国购买十亿英镑的货物。
