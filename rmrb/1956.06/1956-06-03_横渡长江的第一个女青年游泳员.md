    The First Young Woman Swimmer to Cross the Yangtze River
    
    On May 26th, at 2:00 PM, a Force 5 wind sprang up on the surface of the Yangtze River in Wuhan. Waves surged in the river's center, and the current was swift. At Huangwuli in Hanyang, a young woman and eight young men jumped into the Yangtze River, where the water temperature was only 21 degrees Celsius and the flow rate was 2.3 meters per second. They headed downstream, braving the waves toward Jiezhao in Wuchang on the opposite bank. Hanyang and Wuchang are separated by about 1,000 meters. Midway, seven of the young men, succumbing to the cold and exhaustion, climbed onto the rescue boat. Only the young woman and one young man remained in the river, continuing to push forward. They were swallowed by the river for a moment, then reappeared in the churning waves. The young woman consistently swam ahead, pushing through the waves. Finally, they approached the Wuchang bank, but overshot their destination. She immediately mustered her courage to swim against the current. Her arms moved rapidly in alternating strokes, like two swift paddles, striking against the rushing water. She persevered for a full 100 meters. Finally, she reached the destination and came ashore. She accomplished the groundbreaking feat of being the first woman to cross the Yangtze River!

    Following her, the young man also reached the shore with unwavering determination.

    This young woman swimmer, the first to cross the Yangtze River, is named Chen Shanmei. She is 21 years old, a member of the Communist Youth League. She is from Guangzhou and has loved swimming since childhood. Last year, she studied a two-month swimming instructor course at the Beijing Institute of Physical Education. She is now working as a swimming instructor at the Wuhan City Stadium. This time, she crossed the Yangtze River while guiding eight young swimming enthusiasts, with prior approval from the Wuhan Public Security Bureau. The entire swim was 16 li and took a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes.

    Wuhan held a Yangtze River swim twenty-one years ago, but at that time the river surface was calm, and it was from the Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang to near Lanling Road in Hankou, less than half the distance of this swim. No women participated in that swim.

    横渡长江的第一个女青年游泳员
    邵振寰
    五月二十六日下午二时，武汉市的江面上刮起了五级风，江心浪花滚滚，水流湍急。这时，在汉阳的荒五里，有一个年轻姑娘和八个小伙子跳入了水温只有摄氏二十一度、流速每秒二点三公尺的长江里，顺江而下，向对岸的武昌界照破浪前进。汉阳和武昌两岸间隔一千公尺左右。中途，有七个小伙子终因水冷、体力不支，爬上了救护船。江里只剩下这个姑娘和一个小伙子在继续前进。他们一会儿被江水冲没，一会儿又出现在翻腾的浪花里。这个姑娘一直游在前面，排浪前进。终于接近武昌岸了，但又过了目的地。她马上又鼓起勇气逆水游去。她的两臂快速地轮番挥舞，像两支快桨，迎着急湍的流水扑打着，足足挺进了一百公尺。她终于在目的地上岸了。她完成了第一个女子横渡长江的创举！
    接着，那个青年小伙子也以坚忍不拔的意志游到了岸边。
    这位横渡长江的第一个女青年游泳员名叫陈善美，今年二十一岁，青年团员。她是广州人，从小喜爱游泳，去年在北京体育学院学习过两个月的游泳指导课程，现在担任武汉市体育场的游泳辅导工作。她这次横渡长江，是在对八个喜爱游泳的青年进行辅导，事先经武汉市公安局批准进行的。这次游的全程是十六华里，一共游了一点十五分钟。
    武汉市在二十一年前举行过一次横渡长江的游泳，但那时江面风平浪静，并且是由武昌黄鹤楼到汉口兰陵路附近，全程不及这次的一半。在那次游泳中，没有一个女子参加。
