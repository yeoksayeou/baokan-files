Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: United Press International reported: The new Greek Foreign Minister, Averoff, told a reporter from the Paris newspaper "Le Monde" on June 9th that Greece hopes to develop its relations with Eastern European countries, including the Soviet Union. He said: "While continuing to maintain absolute loyalty to our alliance (referring to the North Atlantic Alliance), Greece, like many Western countries, hopes to establish very good relations with all countries that respect its independence and national dignity."

Averoff said that Greece's relations with Yugoslavia and Egypt have been greatly strengthened, and he hopes to further develop this friendly connection.

Averoff succeeded Theotokis as the Greek Foreign Minister. Theotokis was forced to resign due to strong dissatisfaction from the Greek public with his foreign policy of adhering to the West.

    希腊外交大臣表示
    愿同苏联和东欧国家发展关系
    据新华社13日讯　合众社报道：新任希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫六月九日对巴黎“世界报”记者说，希腊希望发展它同包括苏联在内的东欧国家的关系。他说：“在继续保持对我们的联盟（指北大西洋联盟）绝对忠诚的时候，希腊同许多西方国家一样，希望同所有尊重它的独立和民族尊严的国家建立非常良好的关系。”
    阿维罗夫说，希腊同南斯拉夫和埃及的关系已经大大加强了，他希望更好地发展这种友好的联系。
    阿维罗夫是继特奥托基斯任希腊外交大臣的。特奥托基斯因为在外交政策上依从西方遭到希腊公众的强烈不满，而被迫辞职。
