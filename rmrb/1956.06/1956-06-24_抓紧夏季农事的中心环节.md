Seize the Central Link of Summer Farming

The current season is the most intense and busy period for agricultural activities throughout the year. Seedlings of spring-sown crops are flourishing and need strengthened field management. Summer crops must be planted swiftly without missing the opportune time. Flood prevention and pest control are becoming increasingly critical. From now until the autumn harvest, these are the months of decisive significance for agricultural production. Whether the 1956 agricultural production plan can be successfully achieved depends on how well we work during these months.

This year, all regions have set high targets for increasing the production of grain, cotton, oilseeds, flue-cured tobacco, and other crops; the spring plowing and sowing work has generally been done quite well. A considerable foundation has already been laid for striving for a bumper harvest this autumn. However, we should recognize that the completion of sowing plans varies across regions. Nationally, it is estimated that the sowing plans for rice, cotton, soybeans, flue-cured tobacco, and sugar beets can be overfulfilled, while the sowing plans for potatoes, jute, sugarcane, peanuts, and other crops appear to be unachievable. In the coming months, on the one hand, we must strengthen field management of various crops to increase yield per unit area; on the other hand, we must make every effort to plant more cash crops such as peanuts and sesame during the summer sowing period to compensate for the losses from the unfulfilled spring sowing plans for certain cash crops. Thus, the tasks of summer production naturally become more arduous.

This year, various regions have carried out large-scale reforms of the cropping system, expanding the multiple cropping area and planting more high-yield crops. As a result, a series of new problems have arisen in agricultural production. Reforming the cropping system requires higher cultivation techniques, but in most regions, technical guidance has not kept pace; it requires expanding the irrigation area and strengthening drought resistance measures, but the quality of some farmland water conservancy projects built in many regions is not high; it requires applying more fertilizer, but although the amount of fertilizer accumulated in many regions is much higher than in previous years, it is far from meeting this year's needs. Reforming the cropping system is the most effective measure for increasing production, but if various conditions are not coordinated, it will not only fail to increase production but may also cause unnecessary losses. Summer is the season with the most natural disasters. Floods, droughts, pests, and hail are all possible at any time. People often say: if there are no major natural disasters this year, it is certain that production will increase by a dozen or several dozen percent. However, we should now consider: what if major disasters do occur? At present, we cannot prevent all natural disasters from happening, but we should always maintain a high degree of vigilance and make full preparations so that once a disaster occurs, we can quickly overcome it and minimize the losses from the disaster.

All the busy agricultural activities must be completed by the agricultural producers' cooperatives. The Party and government leading organs at the county and district levels should take advantage of the current period, when the sowing work is largely completed, to conduct a serious inspection of the agricultural producers' cooperatives' implementation of the production plan, identify problems and shortcomings, and immediately take measures to remedy them.

The internal affairs of agricultural producers' cooperatives are numerous and complex. What should we focus on inspecting now? The most important point is to check whether the annual production increase targets can be achieved based on the production situation and production experience in the first half of the year. Some cooperatives set excessively high production increase targets at the beginning of this year. When contracting work and output to production teams, most members were unwilling to accept them. Logically, at this time, the unrealistic targets should be appropriately lowered. However, the leading cadres of some cooperatives are unwilling to do so. They believe, "We have already made big promises, how can we be embarrassed to change the targets?" It is not surprising to make big promises due to lack of experience. However, it is not good to fail to correct the plan when it is found to be unachievable. It is not too late to revise the excessively high targets now and ensure the achievement of the plan. If the mistake is repeated, it will cause irreparable losses to the entire cooperative. The leading organs of counties and districts in various regions should quickly help these cooperatives conduct a careful study of the annual production plan. All those that can be completed should be resolutely guaranteed to be completed; those that are indeed unachievable should be appropriately revised so that the production plan is both active and reliable, and truly plays a strong guiding role in production.

The production plans of some cooperatives can be completed, but the measures they have set for increasing production are not substantial enough to ensure the realization of the annual production increase targets. The leading organs of counties and districts should help these cooperatives study and find specific measures to increase production so that they are adapted to the annual production plan. For example, the production increase plans of some cooperatives are to be achieved by expanding the irrigation area and eliminating pests and diseases, but the quality of their newly built wells and ponds is not high and needs to be continued construction and improved quality; they do not have enough water lifting tools, and there are not enough pesticides and agricultural machinery. If these problems are not resolved, how can the production plan be realized?

The central link of summer production is to strengthen field management of various crops. Many advanced technical measures, such as artificial assisted pollination of corn, topping and vine-pressing of peanuts, and cultivation management of double-cropping rice, have been adopted by many farmers. However, the scope and scale of promotion of these measures have never been as large as this year. This means that the responsibility of technical guidance from agricultural departments is unprecedentedly increased. During the spring sowing period this year, agricultural departments in some regions helped cooperatives formulate technical operating procedures, which was a good start. However, these technical operating procedures, which are not yet complete, can only be flexibly applied according to natural conditions and the acceptance capacity of the masses, and the experience of the masses must be summarized and continuously supplemented and revised, and the masses must never be forced to accept them mechanically. All agricultural producers' cooperatives must seize the season, concentrate their main strength, strengthen organizational leadership, adopt advanced technical measures, and effectively improve the quality of operations.

In the busy summer, various field operations are carried out simultaneously, and must be done well at the same time. At present, some cooperatives have not rationally arranged labor, and have focused solely on harvesting wheat, neglecting field management of other crops; some cooperatives have paid attention solely to the management of double-cropping rice fields, and have abandoned the management of single-cropping rice fields. This phenomenon should be changed quickly. The leading organs of counties and districts in various regions must help various cooperatives make a unified arrangement, fully mobilize the labor force of men, women, old and young, and rationally allocate them according to the weight of agricultural work and the characteristics of various labor forces, so that all labor forces can play their due role in production.

This year is the first year after the basic realization of cooperation, and hundreds of millions of peasants are投入 (tóurù, engaged) in production in a planned way under the unified dispatch of the cooperatives. During last year's winter production and this year's spring plowing and sowing period, we actively built farmland water conservancy, increased fertilizer accumulation, and expanded the multiple cropping area, and made unprecedented achievements. In the next few months, as long as we work diligently, make persistent efforts, cultivate various crops well, and strive to overcome natural disasters, we will be able to obtain good results at the time of the autumn harvest.

### 抓紧夏季农事的中心环节

    抓紧夏季农事的中心环节
    现在是一年当中农事活动最紧张最繁忙的季节。春播作物的幼苗正在发荣滋长，需要加强田间管理。夏季作物要不违农时地迅速种好。防汛和治虫的工作越来越紧张。从现在到秋收，是农业生产上具有决定意义的几个月。1956年农业生产计划能不能够胜利实现，就看这几个月中工作得好不好。
    今年各地定的粮食、棉花、油料、烤烟等农作物的增产指标都很高；春耕播种的工作，一般作的也相当好。争取今年秋季的丰收，已经有了相当的基础。但是，我们应该知道，各个地区完成播种计划的情况是不平衡的。就全国范围来说，水稻、棉花、大豆、烤烟、甜菜的播种计划，预计可以超额完成，薯类、黄麻、甘蔗、花生等作物的播种计划，看来就不能完成。在今后的几个月中，一方面要加强各种农作物的田间管理，提高单位面积产量；同时还要尽一切可能，在夏播期间多种一些花生、芝麻等技术作物，补救某些技术作物春播计划没有完成的损失。这样，夏季生产的任务自然就更加繁重了。
    今年各个地区大规模地进行了耕作制度的改革，扩大复种面积，多种高产作物。结果，在农业生产上引起一系列的新问题。改革耕作制度需要更高的栽培技术，但是，多数地区的技术指导却跟不上去；需要扩大灌溉面积和加强抗旱措施，但是，不少地区修建的某些农田水利工程，质量是很不高的；需要施用更多的肥料，但是，许多地区积肥的数量虽比往年多得多，却远远不能满足今年的需要。改革耕作制度是最有效的增产措施，但是，如果各种条件配合不上，就不仅不能增产，而且可能造成不应有的损失。夏季是自然灾害最多的季节。水、旱、虫、雹，随时有发生的可能。人们常说：今年如果没有重大的自然灾害，增产百分之十几或几十是有把握的。但是，现在应当设想一下：如果发生了重大的灾害怎么办呢？目前我们还不可能制止自然灾害都不发生，但是，我们应该经常保持高度的警惕，作好充分的准备，以便一旦发生灾害，能够很快地战胜它，极力减少受灾的损失。
    一切繁忙的农事活动，都要由农业生产合作社来完成。县和区的党政领导机关，应该利用目前这个播种工作大体告一段落的时机，把农业生产合作社执行生产计划的情况，作一次认真的检查，发现问题和缺点，立即采取措施加以补救。
    农业生产合作社内部的事情是千头万绪，现在应该着重检查些什么呢？最重要的一点，就是根据上半年的生产情况和生产经验，检查全年增产指标究竟是否能够完成。某些合作社在今年年初制定了过高的增产指标，在向生产队包工包产的时候，多数社员不肯接受。照理，这时候就应该把不切实际的指标适当地降下来。但是，有些合作社的领导干部却不愿意这样作。他们认为“已经把大话说出去了，怎么好意思改指标呢？”因为缺乏经验而说了大话，这是不足怪的。但是，发现计划不能实现而不改正，那就不好了。现在把过高的指标加以订正，切切实实地保证计划的实现，时间还不算晚。如果一误再误，就将会给全社造成不可挽救的损失。各地县、区领导机关应该迅速帮助这些合作社把全年的生产计划作一次慎重的研究，凡是能够完成的，应当坚决保证完成；确实不能完成的，应当适当地加以修订，使生产计划既积极又可靠，真正在生产中发挥有力的指导作用。
    有些合作社的生产计划是可以完成的，但是，它们定的增产措施却不够充实，不能保证全年增产指标的实现。县区领导机关应当帮助这些合作社研究和找到具体的增产措施，使它同全年的生产计划相适应。例如，有些合作社的增产计划是要靠扩大灌溉面积、消灭病虫害等措施来实现的，但是，它们新修的水井、水塘质量不高，需要继续施工，改善质量；它们准备的提水工具不够，农药农械也不充分。如果不把这些问题解决了，怎样能够实现生产计划呢？
    夏季生产的中心环节是加强各种作物的田间管理。许多先进的技术措施，例如玉米的人工辅助授粉，花生的打顶压蔓，双季水稻的栽培管理等等，已为不少农民所采用。但是，这些措施推行的范围和规模，从来没有今年这样大。这就是说，农业部门技术指导的责任是空前加重了。今年春播期间，有些地区的农业部门帮助合作社制定了技术操作规程，这是一个良好的开端。但是，这种还不完备的技术操作规程，只能根据自然条件和群众的接受能力，灵活地加以运用，并且要总结群众的经验，不断地补充修正，决不能机械地强迫群众接受。一切农业生产合作社都要抓紧季节，集中主要力量，加强组织领导，采取先进的技术措施，切实提高作业质量。
    在繁忙的夏季，各种田间作业交错进行，必须同时作好。目前有些合作社由于没有合理地安排劳力，光顾收割小麦，放松了对其他作物的田间管理；有些合作社单纯注意双季稻田的管理，荒废了单季稻田的管理。这种现象应当赶快改变过来。各地县区领导机关要帮助各个合作社作一个统一的安排，把男女老弱劳动力充分动员起来，根据农活的轻重和各种劳动力的特点，合理地加以调配，使所有劳动力在生产上都发挥应有的作用。
    今年是基本上实现合作化以后的第一年，几万万农民在合作社的统一调度下，有计划地投入生产。在去年的冬季生产和今年的春耕播种期间，我们积极修建农田水利、增积肥料、扩大复种面积，做出了前所未有的成绩。在今后这几个月中，只要兢兢业业，再接再厉，把各种作物栽培好，努力战胜自然灾害，就能够在秋季收获的时候，得到良好的成果。
