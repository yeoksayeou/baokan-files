Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Minister Liao Luyan's reports are, in my opinion, completely in line with reality, and I fully agree with and support them. Now I would like to express some opinions on the ethnic work in Guizhou Province.

    In the past year, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the conscientious implementation of ethnic policies by party and government leaders at all levels, the construction undertakings of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province have made great progress. As of this spring, the agricultural cooperative movement in minority areas across the province has, along with Han areas, realized the primary form of cooperation, and a number of advanced cooperatives have also been established. In counties with larger minority populations, the proportion of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached over 80%. In the cooperative movement, attention has been paid to taking into account ethnic characteristics, and the production enthusiasm of minority peoples is very high. Winter plowing and fertilization last year, and spring sowing this year, have largely completed the plans. For example, in the Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, this year's sowing work was completed about half a month earlier than last year. In the Longjie district of the county, the sowing area and fertilization amount increased by an average of about 50% compared to last year, and the number of workers in some cooperatives reached 98%. According to statistics from about ten counties with concentrated minority populations, such as Ceheng, Wangmo, Guanling, and Huangping, in areas where people were not very accustomed to plowing winter fields and soil in 1954, over 80% of the fields and soil were plowed last winter. The cooperative movement in the minority areas of our province has achieved great success.

    However, there are also some shortcomings and problems in agricultural cooperation and agricultural production. This is mainly because we do not have enough investigation and understanding of the social conditions of ethnic minorities, and the publicity of ethnic policies is not deep enough. Therefore, some areas cannot carry out work practically on the existing basis, resulting in some problems. For example, in the cooperative movement, the "hemp gardens" that should have been appropriately taken care of due to historical legacies of ethnic minorities were not adequately cared for, which caused ideological concerns among some ethnic minorities in some areas and even affected their production enthusiasm. Because "hemp gardens" are the source of raw materials for minority clothing, they have spent many years, even ten years, to manage a "hemp garden" well. In the cooperative movement, when leaving self-retained land for ethnic minorities, the "hemp garden" was left too little or not left at all, and the clothing of ethnic minorities became a problem. For example, in some remote minority areas, because the establishment of cooperatives was too fast and sufficient preparations were not made in advance, and specific leadership was lacking afterwards, sideline production was suspended for a short period, affecting farmers' income. For example, in the Fadi and Longjie districts of Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, a few farmers were originally grain-deficient households in April this year. They had already obtained grain purchase certificates, but due to the suspension of sideline production after cooperation, they had no money on hand and felt life was difficult for a while. It is understood that the number of students in Tianqiao Primary School, Shimen Primary School, and Shimen Middle School has decreased by about one-fifth to one-quarter compared with the second half of last year. This is the result of unilaterally emphasizing collectivization, only paying attention to agricultural production, and neglecting sideline production, which reduced the income of cooperative members. In addition, there are also some impractical practices in the promotion of new agricultural tools. For example, seven-inch plows and double-wheeled double-share plows are not very suitable in some areas of Guizhou. Some areas blindly pursue promotion figures, regardless of whether they are suitable or not. As a result, many agricultural tools are left unused. The Gaochao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guizhu County now has several double-wheeled double-share plows and two seven-inch plows unused. It is hoped that relevant business departments will investigate and study and provide agricultural tools suitable for mountainous areas. Although some of the above-mentioned shortcomings are unavoidable to varying degrees in the work, some are caused by carelessness and lack of foresight. Although these shortcomings have been overcome or are being gradually overcome, we must still pay attention to them in the future, especially in backward minority areas.

    In terms of cultivating ethnic minority cadres, in recent years, adhering to the policy of vigorously cultivating ethnic minority cadres, about 10,000 full-time cadres have been trained through various tasks. Many of these cadres hold important positions at all levels of leadership. Regarding the issue of improving the quality of ethnic minority cadres, attention has been paid to strengthening assistance to ethnic minority cadres in their work and adopting rotational training methods to continuously improve the political, cultural, and professional levels of ethnic minority cadres. At present, the work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres is still developing unevenly, and we should pay attention to the cultivation of ethnic minority women cadres in the future and strengthen the cultivation of ethnic minority scientific and technological cadres. Only in this way can we adapt to the needs of various tasks.

    We must work with the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou to do our work better, strive to overcome the shortcomings and problems in our work, vigorously publicize ethnic policies, learn and publicize the articles of association of advanced cooperatives, and strive to thoroughly realize the national budget for 1956.

    贵州省民族工作情况
    ——杨汉先代表的发言
    李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和廖鲁言部长的报告，我认为完全符合实际，我完全同意和拥护。现在我就贵州省民族工作方面的情况，发表一点意见。
    一年来，由于中央和毛主席的正确领导，各级党政领导认真的贯彻执行了民族政策，贵州省各族人民的建设事业，得到了很大的进展。农业合作化运动截至今年春季全省的少数民族地区已和汉族地区一道实现了初级形式的合作化，并且还办了一批高级社。少数民族较多的县分入社农户也都达到了80％以上。合作化运动中，注意照顾了民族特点，少数民族人民的生产情绪很高，去年的冬耕积肥和今春的播种工作，大都已完成了计划。例如威宁彝族、回族、苗族自治县今年的播种工作比去年提早约半月左右，该县龙街区的播种面积和施肥量平均比去年增加50％左右，有的社出工人数达到了98％。据少数民族聚居的册亨、望谟、关岭、黄平等十来个县的统计，1954年还不很习惯翻犁冬田冬土的地区，在去年冬天翻犁的田土就有80％以上。合作化运动在我省少数民族地区，已获得很大的成绩。
    但是，在农业合作化和农业生产中也存在着一些缺点和问题。这主要是由于我们对少数民族社会情况调查了解不够，宣传民族政策也不够深入，因此，有的地区不能很好的在现有基础上切合实际的开展工作，发生了一些问题，例如在合作化运动中，有的地区对少数民族历史上遗留下的应当适当照顾的“麻园”照顾得不够，以致在某些地区引起了部分少数民族的思想顾虑，甚至影响到他们的生产积极性。因为“麻园”是少数民族衣服原料的来源地，他们经过多少年，甚至十年才搞好一个“麻园”。合作化运动中，在留给少数民族的自留地时，“麻园”留少了或者是没有留，少数民族的“麻园”少了，衣服就成了问题。又如有的边远少数民族地区因为建社较快，事前没有作好充分准备，事后缺乏具体领导，曾经在一个短时期内使副业生产停顿，影响了农民的收入。例如威宁彝族、回族、苗族自治县的法地、龙街几个区，今年四月间有少数农民原系缺粮户，他们已经得到购粮证，但由于合作化后副业生产停顿，手边没钱，一时感到生活困难。据了解，该地天桥小学、石门小学、石门中学等的学生数均比去年下半年减少了约五分之一至四分之一。这都是由于片面强调集体化，只注意农业生产，忽视副业生产，使社员收入减少所造成的结果。此外，在推广新式农具中也有一些不切合实际的作法，如七寸步犁、双轮双铧犁在贵州的某些地区都不很合用，有的地区只盲目追求推广数字，不顾是否适用，结果许多农具被放着和“挂”着，贵筑县高潮农业生产合作社，现在就挂有几部双轮双铧犁和两部七寸步犁。希望有关业务部门调查研究，供给适用山区的农具。上述这些缺点，有的是工作中或多或少难于避免的，但也有的是由于粗枝大叶缺乏预见性所产生的。这些缺点虽然已经克服或者正在逐步克服，可是今后仍然必须注意，特别是在落后的少数民族地区更要注意。
    培养民族干部方面，几年来本着大力培养民族干部的方针，通过各项工作，已经培养出一万名左右的脱产干部。这些干部有不少在各级领导岗位上担任着重要职务。关于提高民族干部的质量问题，注意了在工作中加强对少数民族干部的帮助和采取轮训的办法，使少数民族干部的政治、文化和业务水平得到不断的提高。目前培养民族干部的工作，发展得尚不平衡，今后应注意少数民族妇女干部的培养，加强培养少数民族的科学技术干部。这样才能适应各项工作的需要。
    我们一定要和贵州各族人民一道更好的把我们的工作作好，努力克服我们工作中的缺点和问题，大力宣传民族政策，学习和宣传高级社社章，为彻底实现1956年的国家预算而努力。
