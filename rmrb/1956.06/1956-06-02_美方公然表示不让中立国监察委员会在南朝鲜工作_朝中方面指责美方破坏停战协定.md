Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 1st. According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: At the 70th meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission held on May 31st, the U.S. side publicly stated that it would notify the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its affiliated agencies in Incheon, Busan, and Gunsan to temporarily suspend the implementation of that part of the Armistice Agreement applicable to United Nations Command forces. Those clauses stipulate that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and Neutral Nations Inspection Teams perform duties in areas controlled by the United Nations Command forces.

This meeting was convened at the request of the U.S. side. At the meeting, the U.S. side made its old slander against the Korean-Chinese side, attempting to justify its plot to undermine the Armistice Agreement and shift responsibility to the Korean-Chinese side. Some members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Commission were also slandered by the U.S. side.

Senior Colonel Lu Yin-hui, a member of the Korean-Chinese side, pointed out at the meeting that the U.S. side had finally torn off its mask and openly stated its intention to directly undermine a part of the Armistice Agreement.

After refuting the U.S. side's slanders that the Korean-Chinese side had violated the Armistice Agreement, Senior Colonel Lu Yin-hui pointed out that since the end of the war, it was the U.S. side that had undermined the main clauses of the Armistice Agreement. All the difficulties encountered by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission since its establishment were entirely caused by the U.S. side's illegal actions.

Lu Yin-hui pointed out that the U.S. side is unwilling to consolidate the Korean armistice and make it a lasting peace, and the U.S. side is hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The U.S. side's rejection of the recent proposal by the Chinese and Korean governments to hold a conference of relevant countries to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea once again proves this point.

Lu Yin-hui said that the Armistice Agreement was concluded by agreement between the two sides. It is a whole, and all the provisions therein are its indivisible components. None of these provisions can be altered or abolished unilaterally by either party. Lu Yin-hui warned the U.S. side that if the U.S. side takes any unilateral action, the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    美方公然表示不让中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜工作
    朝中方面指责美方破坏停战协定
    新华社平壤1日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在五月三十一日举行的朝鲜军事停战委员会第七十次会议上，美方公然说它将通知中立国监察委员会和委员会设在仁川、釜山和群山的附属机构，要它们暂时停止执行停战协定条款中适用于联合国军部队的那一部分，那些条款规定中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组在联合国军部队控制的地区执行任务。
    这次会议是美方要求召开的。美方在会上对朝中方面进行了老一套的诽谤，企图为它的破坏停战协定的阴谋辩护，并且把责任推给朝中方面。中立国监察委员会和委员会的某些委员也遭到美方的诬蔑。
    朝中方面委员卢寅熙大校在会上指出，美方终于撕下假面具，公开表明它打算直接破坏停战协定的一部分。
    卢寅熙大校在驳斥了美方诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定的谰言后指出，自从战争结束以来，正是美方破坏了停战协定的主要条款，中立国监察委员会自从成立以来所遭到的一切困难，也完全是由美方的非法行为引起的。
    卢寅熙大校指出，美方不愿意巩固朝鲜停战和使它成为持久和平，美方正在阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。美方拒绝了中朝两国政府最近所提出的关于举行有关国家的会议，讨论像从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队和以和平方法统一朝鲜这样一些问题的建议，就再一次证明了这一点。
    卢寅熙说，停战协定是由双方协议缔结的，它是一个整体，其中一切规定都是它的不可分割的组成部分，这些规定中的任何一条都不能由任何一方擅自更改或者废除。卢寅熙警告美方说，如果美方采取任何单方面的行动，美方必须对由此引起的一切后果负全部责任。
