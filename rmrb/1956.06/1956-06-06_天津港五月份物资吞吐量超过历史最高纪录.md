Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 4th. Tianjin Port's cargo throughput in May exceeded the historical high of March this year by 11%.

　　May was an exceptionally prosperous month for Tianjin Port. Ten-thousand-ton freighters entered and left the new port daily. Battery-powered forklifts, universal loading and unloading machines, etc., operated day and night between the new port, Tanggu, and Hexi wharves. Dockworkers continuously loaded and unloaded the cargo of seventeen ships for two consecutive days. They quickly unloaded machine tools, scientific instruments, and chemical fertilizers from many countries such as Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, and Japan, and loaded ships with goods produced in China such as motors, porcelain, and cheese.

　　The throughput task of Tianjin Port this month exceeded the capacity of the port's warehouses, freight yards, and loading and unloading capabilities. Through improvements in loading and unloading tools, changes in operating methods, and adjustments to labor organization, and with the cooperation of railway cargo owners and other relevant parties, the staff not only prevented port congestion but also completed the loading and unloading tasks of the vast majority of domestic and foreign ships on time or ahead of schedule. The Hexi operation zone loaded and unloaded twenty-seven ships in the whole month, and twenty-four ships left the port ahead of schedule.

    天津港五月份物资吞吐量超过历史最高纪录
    新华社天津4日电　天津港五月份的物资吞吐量，比历史上最高纪录的今年三月份还多11％。
    五月的天津港分外繁荣。天天都有万吨巨轮进出新港。电池搬运车、万能装卸机等昼夜不停地在新港、塘沽和河西码头往来，装卸工人们曾连续二天装卸十七只船舶的货物。他们敏捷地卸下来自南斯拉夫、英国、日本等许多国家的工作母机、科学仪器、化学肥料等物资，又把我国出产的马达、磁器、奶酪等货物装上船只。
    天津港这个月的吞吐任务，超过了天津港的仓库、货场及装卸能力。职工们通过改进装卸工具，改变操作方法，调整劳动组织，并且在铁路货主等有关方面的协作下，不仅没有发生港口堵塞，还使绝大部分国内外船舶的装卸任务按时或提前完成。河西作业区全月装卸二十七条船，有二十四条船提前离港。
