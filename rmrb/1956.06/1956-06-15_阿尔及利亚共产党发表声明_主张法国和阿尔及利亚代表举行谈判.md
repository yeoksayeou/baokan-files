    Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, TASS, Paris, June 13th: According to a report in "l'Humanité," the leading body of the Algerian Communist Party recently issued a statement analyzing the domestic situation and stating its attitude towards the future status of Algeria.

    The Algerian Communist Party advocates a ceasefire and negotiations between French and Algerian representatives.

    The Communist Party believes that a ceasefire is only possible if the French government recognizes the Algerian people's right to self-determination and guarantees the actual exercise of this right by the Algerian resistance movement.

    The statement said: "The Algerian resistance movement recognizes France's legitimate interests in Algeria, as well as the rights and obligations of Algerians of European descent, who are an integral part of Algerian society and who, in the future, can obtain their own place in the Algerian democratic republic, which the vast majority of our people look forward to day and night."

    阿尔及利亚共产党发表声明
    主张法国和阿尔及利亚代表举行谈判
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：据“人道报”报道，阿尔及利亚共产党领导机构最近发表一项声明，分析了国内的局势，并且表明它对阿尔及利亚未来地位的态度。
    阿尔及利亚共产党主张停火，主张法国和阿尔及利亚代表举行谈判。
    共产党相信，只有在法国政府承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利和保证阿尔及利亚抵抗运动实际行使这种权利的情况下，才有可能实现停火。
    声明说：“阿尔及利亚抵抗运动承认法国在阿尔及利亚的合法利益以及欧洲血统的阿尔及利亚人的权利和义务，这些人是阿尔及利亚社会的组成部分，他们今后在我们极大多数人民日夜盼望的阿尔及利亚民主共和国中可以取得他们自己的地位。”
