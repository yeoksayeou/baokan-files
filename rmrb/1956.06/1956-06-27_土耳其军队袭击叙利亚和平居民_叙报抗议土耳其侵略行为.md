    土耳其军队袭击叙利亚和平居民
    叙报抗议土耳其侵略行为
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社大马士革二十五日讯：六月二十二日晚上，两队土耳其的巡逻兵袭击了叙利亚的杰鲁纳村。土耳其士兵向这个村庄开火，并且放了几发火箭弹，因而造成了火灾。当村里的居民赶去救火的时候，土耳其士兵把他们包围起来。农民们实行了抵抗，于是他们和土耳其士兵开始相互射击。宪兵赶来援助。射击继续到六月二十三日早晨才停止。
    后来，两架土耳其飞机侵入了叙利亚的领空，在卡米什拉城、阿穆杰镇和杰鲁纳村上空飞行。
      “旗帜报”对土耳其军事当局的行为表示愤慨，报纸指出叙利亚各界人士要求调查土耳其的这次侵略行为。报纸写道：“土耳其经常在叙利亚的边境上炫耀实力，过去当叙利亚拒绝参加巴格达帝国主义条约的时候，它也采取过这种方式。”
