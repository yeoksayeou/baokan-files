    The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country not only requires state laws and relies on the masses of workers and staff, but also requires the united front to carry it out. To do a good job in the united front work of the national bourgeoisie, we must attach importance to the work of cultivating progressive core elements in industry and commerce.
    In recent years, under the leadership and education of the Party and the state, a number of progressive core elements have emerged in industry and commerce. They are mostly the backbone of the capitalist industry and commerce sector, and can adopt a more positive attitude in the socialist transformation. They have assisted the Party and the government in promoting the participation of industry and commerce in the patriotic movement and in the restoration of the national economy, and have played an active role to varying degrees in accepting processing orders and carrying out joint state-private ownership. The Party and government leading organs in various localities should give sufficient estimation and due attention to their active role. Judging from the situation in various localities, in recent years, the number of such progressive core elements in industry and commerce has gradually increased, and the quality has also improved. However, in terms of the requirements of the state for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the number of such progressive core elements in industry and commerce is not enough, and their distribution among regions and industries is very uneven. The level of awareness of some of them is also not keeping up with the requirements of social development, and their work still needs more supervision, guidance and assistance.
    In order to strengthen the work of cultivating progressive core elements in industry and commerce, it is necessary to clearly recognize the role and standards of progressive core elements. Core elements are the backbone of progressive elements in the capitalist industry and commerce sector. In the future, in the work of enterprise transformation of state-private joint enterprises and the transformation of bourgeois elements, they will play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridging role. What standards must they meet to play these roles? Specifically, it is: core elements must have a long-term vision, be able to understand the laws of social development, understand and master their own destiny, and combine their own destiny with the advancement of the entire society and the future of the country; they must rely on the Communist Party and the People's Government, publicize the Party's policies and state laws, publicize the policies of socialist transformation, and assist the government in correcting erroneous understandings and resistance behaviors in industry and commerce towards socialist transformation; they must set an example in patriotism, law-abiding, and acceptance of socialist transformation, and strive to do a good job in production and management, in order to promote and help the industry to actively carry out enterprise transformation and human transformation; they must study diligently, strive to improve themselves, and actively help others; they must also closely connect with the masses, and represent the legitimate interests and reasonable opinions of industry and commerce. Industrialists and businessmen with industries can of course become progressive core elements, and industrialists and businessmen who do not have industries but have close ties with the masses of industry and commerce can also become progressive core elements. Of course, it is impossible to require all progressive core elements in industry and commerce to meet the due standards one hundred percent at once. It is necessary to constantly educate them, and constantly improve them in their work, so that they can gradually reach the due standards and gradually play a greater role. In the work of cultivating new progressive core elements, more attention should be paid to this point.
    There are some different views in industry and commerce on how to be a progressive core element. Some people believe that the core elements should preferably leave production and specialize in the work of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, so that they can have time to promote the work; some people believe that the core elements should preferably bury themselves in doing a good job in the enterprise, so that they can set an example. Both of these views are one-sided. If everyone does not work in the enterprise, then how can enterprise transformation and human transformation be carried out? And how can it be done well? If everyone does not do the work of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, then who will do the general social activities of industry and commerce? And how can it be done well?
    Among the existing progressive core elements in industry and commerce, there are also some who are arrogant and complacent, or wavering in the face of difficulties, or aloof and self-admiring, and detached from the masses. These shortcomings do not exist in all progressive core elements in industry and commerce, but they do exist in some progressive core elements, which hinders the progress of these people and affects their work in industry and commerce. In order to improve the quality of the work of progressive core elements in industry and commerce, people with the above-mentioned shortcomings should be educated to reflect on themselves and strive for progress. The relevant departments of the Party and government leading organs in various localities also need to understand their problems and difficulties, and give them support and guidance in their work, while helping them to recognize their mistakes, overcome their shortcomings, and strive for progress.
    Currently, progressive core elements in industry and commerce still have some difficulties in their work. Some progressive core elements feel that enterprise work and social activities have not been properly arranged, and thus feel caught in a dilemma. Some progressive core elements feel that their work is not connected, they cannot get involved; or they do not get the opportunity to work. Some progressive core elements feel that when relevant organs assign them work, they only give tasks, but do not explain policies, and lack consultation; they want to do work, but they do not understand the policies. Some progressive core elements feel that relevant organs use them more and educate them less, criticize them more and encourage them less, so they find it difficult to make progress in their work, are afraid of being criticized, dare not raise reasonable opinions, and dare not represent legitimate interests. All these problems need to be solved by the Party and government leading organs in various localities. Some of our cadres are only willing to listen to good words, and are unwilling to listen to bad words. This bad work style not only blocks their own ears and eyes, but also gradually separates the core elements from the masses. This shortcoming must be corrected. Overcoming the difficulties in the work of progressive core elements in industry and commerce can not only improve their enthusiasm, but also help to further promote the entire socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    In order to further promote private industrialists and businessmen to actively accept socialist transformation, it is necessary to strengthen the work of cultivating progressive core elements in industry and commerce. The Communist Party organizations, People's Committees, state-owned enterprises and public-private joint ventures in various localities must give sufficient attention to this work, carefully check and study the current situation, and summarize experience, in order to systematically formulate plans for cultivating progressive core elements in industry and commerce, and implement them with persistent efforts. When studying the situation, summarizing experience, and formulating plans, and in the process of implementing this plan, the Party and government organs in various localities must attach importance to the organizations of the local Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association, be good at obtaining their assistance, and be good at carrying out this aspect of work through them. Various localities must properly do a good job in cultivating progressive core elements in industry and commerce, correctly use them and treat them, in order to smoothly complete the historical task of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

### 培养工商界进步核心分子

    培养工商界进步核心分子
    我国对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，不但要通过国家的法令，要依靠职工群众，而且要经过统一战线来进行。要做好对民族资产阶级的统一战线工作，就必须重视培养工商界中进步核心分子的工作。
    几年来，在党和国家的领导和教育之下，工商界中已经出现了一批进步的核心分子。他们大都是资本主义工商业界的骨干，能够在社会主义改造中采取比较积极的态度。他们协助党和政府推动工商界参加爱国运动，参加国民经济的恢复工作，并且在接受加工订货和进行公私合营的工作中，起着不同程度的积极作用。对于他们的这种积极作用，各地党、政领导机关要有足够的估计，给予应有的重视。从各地的情况来看，这几年，工商界中这种进步核心分子的数量，逐渐在增多，质量也有所提高。但是，从国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的要求来说，工商界中这种进步核心分子的数量还不够多，在地区之间和行业之间分布得还很不平衡，他们中间有一部分人的觉悟程度也还跟不上社会发展的要求，对他们的工作还需要更多的督促、指导和帮助。
    为了加强培养工商界中进步核心分子的工作，必须明确认识进步核心分子的作用和标准。核心分子是资本主义工商业界中进步分子的中坚人物，今后在国家对公私合营企业进行企业改造和对资产阶级分子进行人的改造的工作上，他们要发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。他们要达到什么标准才能发挥这些作用呢？具体说来就是：核心分子要有远大的眼光，能够认识社会发展的规律，认识和掌握他们自己的命运，把自己的命运和整个社会的前进方向以及国家的前途结合起来；要靠拢共产党和人民政府，宣传党的政策和国家的法令，宣传社会主义改造的政策，协助政府纠正工商界中对社会主义改造的错误认识和抗拒行为；要在爱国守法和接受社会主义改造中，以身作则，努力搞好生产经营，用以推动和帮助同业去积极进行企业改造和人的改造；要认真学习，努力提高自己，积极帮助别人；还要密切联系群众，代表工商界的合法利益和合理意见。有产业的工商业者当然能够做进步核心分子，没有产业但与工商界群众有密切联系的工商界人士，同样能够成为进步核心分子。当然，一下子要求工商界进步核心分子都百分之百地达到应有的标准，是不可能的。必须不断地教育他们，不断地在工作中提高他们，才能使他们逐渐达到应有的标准，逐渐发挥更大的作用。在培养新的进步核心分子的工作中，更要注意这一点。
    如何做一个进步核心分子，在工商界中间有一些不同看法。有的人认为核心分子最好是脱离生产，专做民主建国会、工商联合会的工作，这样才能够有时间去推动工作；有的人认为核心分子最好是埋头搞好企业，这样才能够以身作则。这两种看法都是片面的。如果大家都不在企业中工作，那末，企业改造和人的改造如何进行？又怎能做好？如果大家都不做民主建国会、工商联合会的工作，那末，工商界的一般社会活动，由谁去做？又怎能做得好？
    在现有的工商界进步核心分子中间，也有一些人，骄傲自满，或者畏难动摇，或者孤芳自赏，脱离群众。这些缺点，并不是在所有工商界进步核心分子身上都有的，但是，在某些进步核心分子身上确实是存在着的，这就障碍了这些人的进步，并且影响他们在工商界中的工作。为了提高工商界进步核心分子的工作质量，应该教育有上述这些缺点的人反省自己，力求进步。各地党政领导机关的有关部门，也需要了解他们的问题和困难，经常在工作中给以支持和指导，同时帮助他们认识错误，克服缺点，力求进步。
    当前，工商界进步核心分子在工作中还有一些困难。有些进步核心分子感觉到企业工作和社会活动没有得到适当的安排，因而感到左右为难。有些进步核心分子感觉到工作挂不上钩，插不进手；或者得不到工作的机会。有些进步核心分子感觉到有关机关在分配给他们工作的时候，只给任务，不交代政策，并且缺少商量；他们要做工作，但对政策不摸底。有些进步核心分子感觉到有关机关对他们使用多而教育少，批评多而鼓励少，因此，他们在工作中难得进步，怕受批评，不敢提合理意见，不敢代表合法利益。所有这些问题，都需要各地党政领导机关注意加以解决。我们有一些干部只愿听好话，不愿听坏话，这种不良作风，不但闭塞了自己的耳目，而且也使核心分子逐渐脱离群众，这个缺点是必须纠正的。工商界进步核心分子工作中的困难克服了，不但可以提高他们的积极性，同时也有利于进一步推动整个对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作。
    为了进一步推动私营工商业者积极接受社会主义改造，必须加强培养工商界中进步核心分子的工作。各地共产党的组织、人民委员会、国营企业和公私合营企业的公方工作人员，对于这项工作，必须给以足够的重视，认真检查和研究现有的情况，总结经验，以便系统地订出培养工商界进步核心分子的规划，并且用持久不懈的努力，加以实现。在研究情况、总结经验和制定规划的时候，在贯彻执行这个规划的过程中，各地党政机关，必须重视当地工商联和民主建国会的组织，善于取得他们的协助，善于通过他们去进行这一方面的工作。各地必须妥善地做好对工商界进步核心分子的培养工作，正确地去使用他们和对待他们，才能够顺利地完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的历史任务。
