    Welcoming the Soviet Fleet's Visit
    Shanghai in a Festive Mood
    (Our Shanghai dispatch, June 19th) The people of Shanghai are excitedly awaiting the arrival of the Soviet fleet, which will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Today, the Bund is already a scene of celebration. Huge slogans reading "Salute to the heroic Soviet Navy" and "Long live Asian and world peace," hung on the Shanghai Customs Building and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee Building, are even more eye-catching in the early summer sun. Many buildings have strings of colored light bulbs hanging on them, which will be brightly lit at night, resembling crystal palaces of various shapes. Workers have cleaned up the flower beds on the Bund to a pristine condition.

    In the past two days, many art designers have been working day and night. The venues for the soirees and cultural performances to be held during the Soviet Navy's visit have been newly decorated. The Young Pioneer organizations of various primary schools throughout the city have been busy preparing gifts for the guests in recent days. The science and technology group of the No. 8 Primary School on Xinzha Road in the Xincheng District has made an exquisite model of a Sino-Soviet map, symbolizing the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The China Welfare Institute Children's Theater Troupe has rehearsed "Ne Zha Stirs Up the Sea" and is preparing to show the Soviet Navy uncles their play.

    迎接苏联舰队来访
    上海一片节日景象
    本报上海19日电　上海人民怀着激动的心情迎接将在明日到达上海的苏联舰队。今天，外滩已呈现一片节日的景象，在上海海关大楼、上海市人民委员会大厦上面挂着的“向英雄的苏联海军致敬”“亚洲和世界和平万岁”的巨幅标语，迎着初夏的太阳，更加引人注目。许多大厦上都挂上了成串的彩色灯泡，入夜灯光通明，如同各种不同形状的水晶宫。工人们已经把外滩的花圃收拾得十分清洁。
    这两天，许多美术设计工作者在夜以继日地工作。在苏联海军访问期间举行联欢会、文娱晚会的活动场所已布置一新。全市各个小学的少先队组织，连日来忙碌地为客人准备礼品。上海新成区新闸路第八小学的科技小组，做了一付精致的中苏地图模型，象征着中苏两国永恒的友谊。中国福利会儿童剧团排练了“哪叱闹海”，准备请苏联海军叔叔看看他们的戏。
