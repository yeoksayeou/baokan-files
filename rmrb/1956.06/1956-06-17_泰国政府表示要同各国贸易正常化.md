Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram said on June 15th that the Thai government is considering normalizing its trade with all countries.

    He told reporters that Thailand is the only country in Asia maintaining an embargo on strategic materials, but it hopes to conduct normal trade with all regions, including "Communist China".

    Pibul said that restrictions on the flow of materials to Communist China were implemented during the Korean War, but "now that the war is over, we want to enter the free market."

    Pibul said that after the outbreak of the Korean War, Thailand not only agreed to the UN embargo, but also told the UN that it also prohibited the export of rice, timber, castor seeds, sesame seeds and other similar foods to China. The Thai government now intends to tell the United Nations that it will lift the embargo on such commodities, but maintain the embargo on strategic materials such as rubber.

    泰国政府表示要同各国贸易正常化
    据新华社16日讯　泰国总理銮披汶六月十五日说，泰国政府正在考虑使它同所有国家的贸易正常化。
    他在记者招待会上说，泰国是在亚洲维持战略物资禁运的唯一国家，但是，它希望同一切地区进行正常贸易，包括“共产党中国”在内。
    銮披汶说，对于向共产党中国流入物资的限制是在朝鲜战争期间实行的，但是“既然战争已经结束，我们就希望进入自由市场”。
    銮披汶说，在朝鲜战争爆发以后，泰国不只同意联合国的禁运，而且告诉联合国，它还禁止向中国输出大米、木材、蓖麻子以及芝麻子和其他类似的食品。泰国政府现在打算告诉联合国，它将取消对这样一些商品的禁运，但是维持对橡胶这类战略物资的禁运。
