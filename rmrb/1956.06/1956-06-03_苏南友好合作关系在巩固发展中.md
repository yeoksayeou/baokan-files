    The spring of 1955 was especially unforgettable. After the historic Asian-African Conference victoriously completed its tasks and the long-delayed Austrian State Treaty was signed, news also came of the visit of Soviet leaders to Yugoslavia and the high-level talks held between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The result of this meeting led to the signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav government declaration in Belgrade on June 2nd. It swept away the obstacles that had accumulated between the two countries for many years, clarified many outstanding issues, and laid the foundation for restoring and developing the traditional fraternal friendship between these two socialist countries.
    The Soviet-Yugoslav declaration showed the world the sincere desire of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia to improve relations between the two countries and their common concern for world peace and the socialist cause. The declaration expressed the consensus of both sides on major international issues such as disarmament, collective security, peaceful coexistence, consolidation of peace, and the development of economic and cultural cooperation between countries, and stipulated many important measures to promote comprehensive cooperation between the two countries. Because this declaration embodied the principles of international relations of mutual respect for sovereignty and independence, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit, and was in line with strengthening European and world peace and the interests of the international workers' movement, it was warmly welcomed by the people of all countries.
    It has been a year since the signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav declaration. Over the past year, based on the successful implementation of the Soviet-Yugoslav declaration, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have been consolidating and developing effectively. The visit of Yugoslav President Tito to the Soviet Union is an important result of this development.
    In summarizing the Soviet-Yugoslav relations over the past year, it must first be pointed out the achievements made by the two countries in strengthening their economic ties and expanding economic cooperation. Even before the talks, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia had signed a trade payment agreement on January 5, 1955, determining the delivery lists for the two countries in 1955. Shortly after the publication of the Soviet-Yugoslav declaration, representatives of the two countries signed a supplementary commodity list to the trade agreement in July, increasing the originally planned total trade value by 60%. At the end of August and the beginning of September, the government economic delegations of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia held negotiations in Moscow, and the two sides agreed to increase the total trade volume to $70 million per year in the next three years, and take measures to continue to increase trade volume in subsequent years. The two delegations also exchanged views on long-term cooperation issues and decided to conclude several economic cooperation agreements and a scientific and technological cooperation agreement in the near future. These agreements have now been signed separately at the end of last year and the beginning of this year.
    According to the agreement on cooperation between the two countries in the construction of industrial enterprises in Yugoslavia, which was signed in Belgrade in mid-January this year, Yugoslavia will build two chemical plants, a thermal power plant, and expand three mines. The Soviet Union will be responsible for the design work, provide equipment, send experts to guide the installation of the project, enable the above-mentioned enterprises to be put into production, and provide free of charge the permits and technical documents required for organizing the production of the above-mentioned enterprises. In order to pay for the design work, equipment and materials, the Soviet government will provide Yugoslavia with a corresponding number of loans, which will be repaid in ten years with an annual interest rate of 2%.
    In addition, the Soviet-Yugoslav loan agreement was signed in Moscow on February 2, deciding that the Soviet Union would grant Yugoslavia a total loan of $84 million. Among them, $30 million is a loan, which is lent in freely convertible currency or gold, and repaid in ten years with an annual interest rate of 2%; $54 million is trade credit, which is given to Yugoslavia to pay for the goods supplied by the Soviet Union to Yugoslavia from 1956 to 1958. This loan is also stipulated to be repaid in ten years with an annual interest rate of 2%. The Yugoslav "Economic Policy" weekly pointed out in commenting on the significance of these agreements, "These agreements are not only a new contribution to the expansion of economic cooperation between the two countries, but also a new contribution to the realization of new trends in Yugoslavia's economic development in the coming period."
    There has also been great progress in scientific and technological cooperation. The Soviet-Yugoslav Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement signed last December stipulates that both parties will exchange experience and technical achievements in industry, agriculture and other economic sectors. At the same time, it also stipulates that patent rights, licenses and technical documents will be provided to each other on a reciprocal basis, experts and students will be exchanged, and a Soviet-Yugoslav Technical Committee will be established. The governments of the two countries expressed their support for the purpose of peaceful use of atomic energy in last year's declaration and agreed to conduct mutual cooperation in this regard. In January of this year, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia signed an agreement on cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. In addition to general cooperation and exchange of experience in the development of atomic energy, the agreement also stipulates that the Soviet Union will provide scientific and technical assistance in the construction of an atomic reactor in Yugoslavia, and provide the equipment and nuclear fuel necessary to ensure the continuous operation of the reactor.
    In addition, in accordance with the spirit of the Soviet-Yugoslav declaration, the two countries have also signed a civil aviation agreement, a postal and telecommunications agreement, and a treaty on resolving the issue of dual nationality.
    Cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts play an important role in enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Over the past year, educators, journalists, writers, artists, scientists, trade union workers, athletes and young people from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have made friendly visits to each other, and the two countries have also exchanged parliamentary delegations. Through this extensive contact, the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have further understood each other's lives and achievements in various fields, exchanged socialist experiences, and communicated their thoughts and feelings. Both sides have personally experienced the deep desire of the people of the two countries to enhance mutual trust and fraternal friendship.
    Thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the various measures stipulated in the declaration a year ago have been effectively implemented, and the two countries have achieved remarkable results in developing friendly cooperation. The people of the two countries have already been connected by many friendly ties. As President Tito said: "There are no longer any major and difficult problems to solve between us. We have effectively eliminated almost all the negative things that have accumulated in the past, and we have both come to the conclusion and paved the way for comprehensive cooperation in the economic, political and cultural fields." Yugoslav Federal Executive Council Vice President Kardelj, who accompanied President Tito on his visit to the Soviet Union, recently pointed out in a speech the prospects for establishing relations between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and developing concrete cooperation between them.
    Of course, the important significance of the Soviet-Yugoslav declaration far exceeds the scope of relations between the two countries. It opened the way for European People's Democratic countries to restore normal relations with Yugoslavia and develop friendly cooperation. Over the past year, Yugoslavia's relations with European People's Democratic countries have made significant progress. Their trade volume continues to increase, economic cooperation, cultural exchanges and friendly exchanges between each other are becoming increasingly close, and many issues that have been unresolved for many years have been or are being resolved one by one. Because they both have the desire to improve and develop their relations, there is a positive and good prospect in this regard.
    At the same time, the increase in friendly and cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and European People's Democratic countries and Yugoslavia is a great blow to the imperialist forces that are trying to create conflicts among the people of all countries and use them to exacerbate tensions, and it is an important contribution to consolidating the security of Europe and the Balkans and strengthening the cause of world peace.
    As people look back with satisfaction on the progress made in Soviet-Yugoslav relations over the past year, Yugoslav President Tito has been invited to visit the Soviet Union. President Tito's visit to the Soviet Union marks a new stage in the development of friendly relations and comprehensive cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia share common ideas and a common goal of striving for peace, democracy and socialism, and they also have a common desire to further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. At the same time, they also have consistent views on many major international issues. All this gives people reason to hope that the upcoming talks between the leaders of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments will create new and more favorable conditions for the development and consolidation of the friendly cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, for the advancement of the socialist cause, and for the consolidation of world peace and the promotion of international understanding, trust and cooperation.

    苏南友好合作关系在巩固发展中
    陈维
    1955年的春天是特别令人难忘的。在具有历史意义的亚非会议胜利完成任务和迁延达十年之久的对奥和约签订以后，又传来了苏联领袖访问南斯拉夫和苏南两国举行最高级会谈的消息。这次会谈的结果导致了六月二日在贝尔格莱德签订的苏南两国政府宣言。它一扫多年来堆积在两国之间的障碍，澄清了许多悬而未决的问题，为恢复发展这两个社会主义国家之间的传统的兄弟友谊奠定了基础。
    苏南两国宣言向全世界表明了苏联和南斯拉夫对于改善两国关系的真诚愿望和它们对世界和平与社会主义事业的共同关怀。宣言在裁减军备、集体安全、和平共处、巩固和平和发展各国经济文化合作等这些重大的国际问题上，表现了双方一致的见解，并且规定了促进两国全面合作的许多重要措施。由于这个宣言体现了互相尊重主权独立、互不干涉内政、平等互利的国际关系原则，符合于加强欧洲与世界和平和国际工人运动的利益，因此它受到了各国人民的热烈欢迎。
    苏南两国宣言签订已经一年了。一年以来，在顺利执行苏南宣言的基础上，两国的友好合作关系正在卓有成效地巩固和发展着。南斯拉夫总统铁托的访问苏联，正是这种发展的重要的结果。
    在总结这一年来的苏南关系的时候，首先必须指出两国在加强双方经济联系和扩大经济合作方面所取得的成就。还在会谈之前，苏南两国已在1955年1月5日签订了贸易支付协定，确定了两国在1955年的交货单。苏南宣言发表以后不久，两国代表又在七月签订了贸易协定补充商品单，把原定的贸易总值增加60％。八月底和九月初，苏南两国政府经济代表团在莫斯科举行了谈判，双方议定把最近三年内的贸易总额增加到每年七千万美元，并将在以后的年份中采取措施继续增加贸易额。双方代表团还就长期合作问题交换了意见，决定在最近期内缔结几项经济合作的协定和一项科学技术合作协定。现在这些协定都已在去年年底和今年年初分别签订了。
    根据今年一月中在贝尔格莱德签订的关于两国在南斯拉夫建设工业企业方面实行合作的协定，南斯拉夫将兴建两座化学工厂、一座热电站和扩建三座矿山。苏联将对这些企业的建设担负设计工作，提供设备，派遣专家指导安装工程，使上述企业投入生产，和无偿地供给为组织上述企业的生产所需的特许证和技术文件。为了支付设计工作、设备和材料所需的款项，苏联政府给予南斯拉夫以相应数目的贷款，共分十年还清，年息二厘。
    另外，今年二月二日在莫斯科签订了苏南贷款协定，决定由苏联给予南斯拉夫以总额为八千四百万美元的贷款。其中三千万美元为借款，以自由兑换的货币或黄金贷给，分十年偿清，年息二厘；五千四百万美元为贸易信贷，给南斯拉夫用来支付1956到1958年苏联供给南斯拉夫的商品的货款。这笔贷款也规定在十年中偿清，年息二厘。南斯拉夫的“经济政治”周刊在评论这些协定的意义时指出，“这些协定不仅是对两国之间经济合作扩大的新的贡献，而且也是对于在即将到来的期间内实现南斯拉夫经济发展的新趋势的新贡献。”
    在科学技术合作方面也有很大的进展。去年十二月签订的苏南两国科学技术合作协定，规定双方交流工业、农业和其他经济部门中的经验和技术成就。同时还规定在互惠的基础上互相提供专利权、许可证和技术文件，互派专家和留学生，以及成立苏南技术委员会等。两国政府在去年的宣言中曾表示支持和平利用原子能的目的，并同意在这方面进行相互的合作。今年一月间，苏南两国签订了在和平利用原子能方面进行合作的协定。除了在原子能的发展方面进行一般的合作和经验交流以外，协定还规定苏联在南斯拉夫建筑一座原子反应堆的工作上给予科学和技术的援助，并供给保证反应堆不断运转所必需的设备和核子燃料。
    此外，根据苏南宣言的精神，两国还签订了民用航空协定，邮电协定和关于解决双重国籍问题的条约等。
    文化交流和人民之间的往来接触，对于增进苏南两国人民的相互了解和友谊起着重要的作用。在过去一年内，苏南两国的教育工作者、新闻工作者、作家、艺术家、科学家、工会工作者、运动员和青年们都相互进行了友好的访问，两国并且还交换了议会代表团。通过这种广泛的接触，苏南两国人民进一步了解了彼此的生活和各方面的成就，交流了社会主义经验，沟通了思想感情。双方都亲身体验到了两国人民对于增进相互之间的信任和兄弟友谊的深切愿望。
    由于苏南两国的共同努力，一年前的宣言所规定的各项措施都已有效地实现了，两国在发展友好合作的事业中已取得了显著成果，两国人民之间已经以许多友好的纽带联系在一起。正像铁托总统所说的：“我们之间不再存在任何重大的和难以解决的问题。我们有效地消除了过去积累起来的几乎所有消极的东西，我们双方由此作出了结论，并且铺平了在经济、政治和文化方面全面合作的道路。”这次随同铁托总统前往苏联访问的南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席卡德尔，在最近发表的一次谈话中，同时指出了建立南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和苏联共产党之间的关系和发展它们之间具体合作的前景。
    当然，苏南宣言的重要意义远远超出了两国关系的范围。它为欧洲人民民主国家同南斯拉夫之间恢复正常关系和发展友好合作打开了道路。一年以来，南斯拉夫同欧洲人民民主国家的关系有了显著的进展。它们的贸易额不断增加，相互之间的经济合作、文化交流和友好往来日益密切，许多多年来曾经悬而未决的问题已经或正在逐一获得解决。由于彼此都具有改善和发展双方关系的愿望，因此在这方面是有着肯定的良好前景的。
    同时，苏联和欧洲人民民主国家同南斯拉夫友好合作关系的增进，对于那些一心想在各国人民中间制造冲突，借以加剧紧张局势的帝国主义势力是一个很大的打击，而对于巩固欧洲和巴尔干地区的安全，对于加强世界和平事业则是一个重要的贡献。
    在人们满意地回顾苏南两国关系这一年来的进展的时候，南斯拉夫总统铁托已应邀到达苏联访问。铁托总统的访问苏联，标志着苏南两国友好关系发展和全面合作新阶段。苏联和南斯拉夫两国有着共同的思想和争取和平、民主与社会主义的共同目标，更有着进一步加强两国友好关系的共同愿望。同时，它们对于许多重大的国际问题的看法也是一致的。这一切，使人们有理由希望，即将举行的苏南两国政府领导人之间的会谈，将为发展和巩固苏南两国人民的友好合作，为推进社会主义的事业，为巩固世界和平和增进国际间的谅解信任和合作，创造新的更加有利的条件。
