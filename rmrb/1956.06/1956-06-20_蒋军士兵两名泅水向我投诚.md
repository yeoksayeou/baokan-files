    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, June 19th: Chiang Kai-shek soldier Huang Kunxiong swam for six hours from Jinmen Island and arrived in Tong'an County, Fujian Province, at 8:30 AM on the 17th, defecting to a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He was warmly received by our officers and soldiers.
    Huang Kunxiong is a first-class sapper from the 1st Platoon, 2nd Company, Engineer Battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek 81st Division. He brought a lifebuoy, a rifle, a bayonet, and some bullets and grenades.
    Huang Kunxiong is a 22-year-old native of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. He was forcibly conscripted into the Chiang Kai-shek army in February 1955. Before enlisting, he studied at Kaohsiung High School and worked in a factory.
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek soldier Wang Jialun (formerly named Wang Jiaen) swam from Jinmen Island to Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, and defected to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    Wang Jialun said that because he was homesick, he spent 30 Taiwan dollars to buy a car tire inner tube after arriving on Jinmen Island in April, preparing to swim over and defect. At 9:00 PM on June 11th, he took the car tire inner tube and went into the sea, swimming towards the mainland. Because he was physically weak, he vomited blood several times along the way and then lost consciousness at sea. At 5:00 PM on the 12th, he was discovered by militiamen from Jinjiang County, who rescued him ashore by boat. After the doctor's extensive emergency treatment, he regained consciousness and was only able to speak in a low voice by noon on the 13th. He expressed extreme excitement and gratitude for returning to the embrace of the motherland and living in a comfortable and spacious hospital.
    Wang Jialun is a second-class ammunition soldier from the 1st Platoon, 2nd Company, Artillery Battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek 93rd Division. He is from Daishan Village, Dinghai County, Zhejiang Province. He was captured into the Chiang Kai-shek army in March 1950 when the Chiang Kai-shek army retreated from the Zhoushan Islands.

    蒋军士兵两名泅水向我投诚
    新华社福建前线19日电　蒋军士兵黄坤雄从金门岛泅水六个小时，在十七日晨八时半到达福建省同安县境，向中国人民解放军某部投诚，受到我军官兵的热情接待。
    黄坤雄是蒋军八十一师工兵营二连一排一等工兵，带来救生圈一个，步枪一支，刺刀一把和一些子弹、手榴弹。
    黄坤雄是台湾高雄市人，二十二岁，1955年2月被蒋军强征入伍。入伍前曾在高雄中学读书，在工厂做工。
    新华社讯　蒋军士兵王家轮（原名王家恩），从金门岛泅水到达福建省晋江县境，向中国人民解放军投诚。
    王家轮说，由于他思乡心切，今年四月到金门岛以后，花了三十元台币买了一条汽车轮内胎，准备泅水投诚。六月十一日晚九时，他带着汽车轮内胎下海，向大陆泅来，因为身体虚弱，半途吐了几次血，以后昏迷在海上。十二日下午五时，被晋江县民兵发觉，乘船将他打捞上岸。经过医生的多方急救，他才恢复知觉，到十三日中午才能低声说话。他对重回祖国怀抱，住在舒适宽敞的医院里，表示异常兴奋和感激。
    王家轮是蒋军九十三师炮兵营二连一排二等弹药兵，浙江省定海县岱山村人。他是在1950年3月蒋军从舟山群岛撤逃时被抓入蒋军的。
