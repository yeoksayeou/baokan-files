Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th - Seoul dispatch: Only three days after the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams withdrew from South Korea, Syngman Rhee has already been increasing troop deployments to the Military Armistice Line, creating a tense atmosphere.

Syngman Rhee's Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Lee Hyung-keun, revealed to a United Press reporter today that Syngman Rhee is currently "cautiously increasing troop deployments to the front line" in order to strengthen so-called "defensive potential." Lee Hyung-keun said he "appreciates the United Nations' decision to expel the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but this does not necessarily satisfy all of our wishes."

According to Kim Yong-woo, the recently appointed Minister of National Defense by Syngman Rhee, on the 8th, Syngman Rhee's troops are receiving training on chemical, biological, and atomic warfare. He said, "It is impossible to reduce the Korean armed forces," and he also hopes to obtain atomic weapons. At the same time, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army stationed in South Korea, White, also openly complained that the armistice agreement restricted him from further arming the troops under his command. He said he "hopes to have an army equipped with the most modern weapons available."

The American propaganda machine has been intensifying the fabrication of lies about the Korean and Chinese sides violating the armistice agreement by shipping in weapons, in order to create a pretext for further undermining the armistice agreement and openly massively arming the troops in South Korea. According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 11th, American military personnel have been trying their best to demand the government "declare that the United Nations Command will no longer abide by the provisions in the armistice agreement regarding the prohibition of importing new-style weapons and military aircraft." The same dispatch revealed that the United States is still not satisfied with the measures it has already taken, namely "declaring the Neutral Nations Inspection system a failure and refusing to cooperate in continuing to respect this system."

    李承晚开始向军事停战线增调部队
    美国宣传机器也加紧制造紧张空气
    新华社平壤12日电　汉城消息：中立国视察小组撤出南朝鲜仅仅三天，李承晚已经在向军事停战线增调部队，制造紧张空气。
    李承晚的联合参谋总长李亨根今天向合众社记者透露，李承晚目前正在“小心地增调军队到前线去”，以加强所谓“防御潜力”。李亨根说，他“感谢联合国所作的驱逐中立国监察委员会的决定，但是这不一定满足我们的所有愿望。”
    据李承晚最近任命的国防部长官金用雨在八日透露，李承晚军队正在受关于化学、生物和原子战争的训练。他说，“不可能裁减韩国武装部队”，他并且希望得到原子武器。同时，驻在南朝鲜的美国第八军军长怀特也公开抱怨停战协定限制了他进一步武装他所指挥的部队。他说，他“希望有一支用所能得到的最现代化的武器装备好的军队”。
    美国的宣传机器连日正在加紧捏造朝中方面违反停战协定运进武器的谎言，以便为进一步破坏停战协定、公开大规模武装在南朝鲜的军队制造借口。据合众社十一日从东京发出的消息说，美国军事人员曾经竭力向政府要求“宣布联合国军司令部将不再遵守停战协定中关于禁止输入新式武器和军用飞机的规定”。同一消息透露，美国对它已经采取的措施，即“宣布中立国视察制度是一个失败，并且拒绝进行合作来继续尊重这个制度”仍然不能满足。
