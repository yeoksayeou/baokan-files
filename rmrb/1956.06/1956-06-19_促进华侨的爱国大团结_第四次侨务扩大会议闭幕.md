Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: The Fourth Enlarged Meeting of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission closed this afternoon in the State Council Auditorium.

Premier Zhou Enlai came to the meeting hall to meet with the representatives. He held cordial conversations with them and took a photo with all the representatives.

The first resolution passed by the meeting expressed agreement with the "Several Policies on Current Domestic Overseas Chinese Affairs" proposed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. It believes that these policies are of positive significance for resolving the pressing problems existing in current domestic overseas Chinese affairs, bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativity of family members of Overseas Chinese and returned Overseas Chinese in participating in socialist construction, improving the material and cultural living standards of family members of Overseas Chinese and returned Overseas Chinese, and promoting the patriotic unity of Overseas Chinese. The meeting requested the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Overseas Chinese affairs organs at all levels to cooperate with relevant departments to take effective measures to ensure the implementation and realization of various Overseas Chinese affairs policies, and called on all family members of Overseas Chinese and returned Overseas Chinese to give strong support.

The meeting then passed a resolution on the opinions of the proposal review, agreeing, according to the suggestions of the proposal review group, to submit the 56 proposals related to Overseas Chinese affairs work put forward by the representatives to relevant departments for handling, research, or reference.

Chen Jiageng, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, delivered the closing speech at the meeting. He pointed out that in recent years, due to the increasingly close ties between Overseas Chinese and the motherland, the unity of Overseas Chinese has developed. Chen Jiageng hoped that Overseas Chinese who have a relatively good understanding of the motherland will introduce the situation of the motherland to those Overseas Chinese who do not yet understand the motherland well, unite them, and not discriminate against them. Chen Jiageng said that the motherland welcomes Overseas Chinese to return to the country for sightseeing and inspection, and even those who currently have doubts about the motherland are welcome to come back and see for themselves.

Chen Jiageng said that Overseas Chinese love their motherland. Before liberation, Overseas Chinese felt helpless to donate funds to the country due to the poor political situation in the motherland. Now that we have a strong motherland, the wishes of many years have been realized, and we should pool our efforts to fulfill our responsibilities and participate in the construction of the motherland.

Chen Jiageng finally hoped that after returning, all representatives would widely convey the spirit of this meeting, to further encourage family members of Overseas Chinese and returned Overseas Chinese to actively participate in socialist construction, to gradually improve the living standards of family members of Overseas Chinese and returned Overseas Chinese, and to strive to promote the patriotic unity of Overseas Chinese abroad.

    促进华侨的爱国大团结
    第四次侨务扩大会议闭幕
    新华社17日讯　第四次侨务扩大会议今天下午在国务院礼堂闭幕。
    周恩来总理来到会场同代表们见面。他同代表们亲切地进行了谈话，并且同全体代表在一起照了像。
    会议通过的头一项决议表示同意华侨事务委员会提出的“关于目前国内侨务工作的若干政策”，认为这些政策对于解决当前国内侨务工作中存在的迫切问题，发挥侨眷、归侨参加社会主义建设的积极性和创造性，提高侨眷、归侨的物质和文化生活水平，促进华侨的爱国团结都具有积极的意义。会议要求华侨事务委员会和各级侨务机关协同各有关部门采取有效措施，保证贯彻和实现各项侨务政策，并且号召全体侨眷、归侨给予大力支持。
    会议接着通过了关于提案审查意见的决议，同意按照提案审查小组的建议，把代表们提出的有关侨务工作的五十六件提案，分别提请有关部门办理、研究或参考。
    华侨事务委员会委员陈嘉庚在会上致闭幕词。他指出，几年来由于华侨和祖国的联系日益密切，华侨的团结已经有了发展。陈嘉庚希望对祖国比较了解的华侨多向那些比较还不了解祖国的华侨介绍祖国情况，团结他们而不要歧视他们。陈嘉庚说，祖国欢迎华侨回国观光考察，即使对那些目前还对祖国抱有怀疑的，也欢迎他们回来看看。
    陈嘉庚说，华侨是热爱祖国的。在解放以前，华侨以祖国政治不良，爱国捐资无从下手。现在我们有了强大的祖国，多年的愿望已经实现，应该群策群力尽自己的责任参加祖国建设事业。
    陈嘉庚最后希望各位代表回去以后，将这次会议的精神广泛传达，为进一步鼓舞侨眷、归侨积极参加社会主义建设事业，为逐步提高和改善侨眷、归侨的生活水平，为促进国外华侨爱国大团结而奋斗。
