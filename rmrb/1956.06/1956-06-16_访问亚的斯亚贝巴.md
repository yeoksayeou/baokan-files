    Visiting Addis Ababa
    ·Ethiopian Airmail·
    Feng Zhidan
    From April 28th to May 14th, the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation visited Addis Ababa, the capital of the Kingdom of Ethiopia. When we arrived at the East African Plateau, which is nearly 2,500 meters above sea level, from the Sudanese Basin, we felt our hearts beating particularly fast. But when we saw a beautiful small city, everyone completely forgot about the physiological reaction caused by the low air pressure.
    Addis Ababa is a bit like Qingdao in China. It has several crisscrossing asphalt roads that go up and down slopes. The evergreen and slender "eucalyptus" trees sway gracefully in the wind.
    Addis Ababa means "new flower" in Amharic. It is said that seventy-three years ago, Ethiopian King Menelik II was traveling to a hilltop called Entoto, where he saw a field of colorful wildflowers blooming among the green trees. Now, if you go more than 20 kilometers outside the city, you can still see flowers blooming all over the mountains and fields.
    Glorious History
    When mentioning Ethiopia, one cannot help but think of the glorious deeds of the Ethiopian people bravely resisting the Italian fascist aggressors twenty years ago. In October 1935, Italian fascist invading troops invaded Ethiopia, and the people bravely rose up to defend their homeland. A month later, the Ethiopian army retreated to the south, trapping the invading army in the mountains. In the end, Mussolini could only win the war by using the barbaric means of releasing poison gas. It was not until May 1936 that the Italian army occupied Addis Ababa.
    But the Ethiopian people were unyielding. In 1941, Ethiopia raised its own flag again. Today, in Addis Ababa, one sees a "February 19th Monument" erected on "February 19th Square," piercing into the clouds. February 19th is the day commemorating the massacre of the people by the Italian occupation forces. Two brave Ethiopians threw bombs at an Italian general, and the Italian fascist bandits immediately retaliated with a massacre, killing 150,000 Ethiopians in one day, most of whom were women and children. In Addis Ababa, there is also a church where the ashes of the martyrs are kept, all of which are historical testimonies of the heroic struggle of the Ethiopian people.
    In Addis Ababa, we heard the tragic song of the Ethiopian artist Fagheri. This is a song mourning the martyrs in the war of resistance against Italy, which aroused people's respect and remembrance for those martyrs who bravely sacrificed for the independence and freedom of Ethiopia.
    Ten Thousand People Vie to See Chinese Song and Dance
    The residents of Addis Ababa have never encountered so many Chinese people. These guests were entrusted by 600 million Chinese people to express friendship to the Ethiopian people in their artistic language.
    During the seventeen-day visit to the Kingdom of Ethiopia, Chinese artists performed a total of ten shows at the Haile Selassie I Theatre in Addis Ababa. The theater has 1,200 seats, and every show was full. Approximately one in every thirty residents of Addis Ababa watched the Chinese art performance. But after each performance began, the theater was still crowded with people, and several large glass panes of the theater's door were crushed by the crowd. People said that the performance of Chinese artists set off a huge wave in the cultural life of the residents of Addis Ababa.
    The newspapers in Addis Ababa gave enthusiastic reviews of the performances of Chinese artists. "The Ethiopian Herald" wrote: "The Ethiopian people can easily understand the artistic language of the Chinese people. The performance of Chinese artists gives the Ethiopian people a good opportunity to understand the cultural traditions of an ancient country that is undergoing tremendous changes."
    They Met True Friends
    During the performance, I often met an electrician named Abata. He was in charge of the stage lighting. He watched ten Chinese art performances. Abata said to me: "I have never met Chinese people before. Now that I have seen your performance, I am so moved. Imperialists often say bad things about you, but I can see that you are our true friends. It's a pity that you are here for such a short time." Abata said: "You know how much we Ethiopians like your art performances! Some Western troupes have come here to perform before, but the theater has never been full, sometimes with only a few dozen audience members. But your performance has fascinated the Ethiopians. You see, the door of the theater has been broken."
    In the process of contacting many people, I realized that the Ethiopian people are very friendly to the Chinese people. I once visited an Ethiopian young painter, Afeweil, who was painting for the court. He said: "You have come from faraway China, and I feel that you are my friends, and I very much like your art. I also hope to have the opportunity to visit your country in the future."
    I also visited the Ethiopian National Library. There are 50,000 books in the library, including some ancient books that are already 800 years old. The deputy director of the library said: "We are very proud because we have more than 50,000 books. But it is a pity that there are no Chinese books here." Later, the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation presented the library with a set of famous Chinese paintings from past dynasties and some Chinese books and albums. The deputy director happily accepted these gifts. He said: "These donated books symbolize the friendship between the Chinese people and the Ethiopian people."
    An Ethiopian told me: "In this country, the one who does not welcome your visit is the American Embassy in Addis Ababa. They have tried their best to obstruct your visit, but they have found themselves powerless."
    Americans with ulterior motives
    When mentioning Americans, Ethiopians all shake their heads and sigh.
    American influence only infiltrated after World War II. In 1952, Ethiopia accepted the so-called "Point Four Program" "assistance" from the United States, and then a large number of American personnel from the "Point Four Program" infiltrated the country. According to someone familiar with the situation, there are about one hundred American "advisors" and "experts" staying in Ethiopia. They are not at all interested in how to help the Ethiopian people get rid of poverty and economic backwardness. They are not concerned with helping economically backward Ethiopia develop its own industry, but are trying to expand the power of American monopoly capital.
    An Ethiopian told me that the Americans have several air force bases near Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. Once I saw an American military aircraft parked at the airport in Addis Ababa. Someone told me that this was an American air force plane that flew from an air force base in Ethiopia.
    It is reported that the ruling group in Washington is painstakingly plotting a conspiracy for a pan-African aggression alliance, attempting to use Ethiopia as a stepping stone for its invasion of Africa. However, the Ethiopian people who love freedom will not let others dictate their fate. (Attached picture)

    访问亚的斯亚贝巴
    ·埃塞俄比亚航讯·
    冯之丹
    四月二十八日至五月十四日，中国文化艺术代表团访问了埃塞俄比亚王国的首都亚的斯亚贝巴。当我们从苏丹盆地到了拔海近二千五百多公尺的东非高原时，觉得心脏跳动得特别快。但是当我们看到了一座美丽的小城时，大家都把低气压所引起的生理反应完全忘掉了。
    亚的斯亚贝巴有点像我国的青岛。它有着好几条纵横的上下坡柏油路。碧绿常青和细长苗条的“有加利”树，婀娜多姿地随风摆动。
    亚的斯亚贝巴，阿姆哈拉语的意思是“新花”。据说这是因为七十三年前埃塞俄比亚国王麦涅力克二世巡行到这里的一个名叫安多多的山头上，只见绿树丛中开遍了一片彩色缤纷的野花。现在，如果你走出市郊二十多公里以外，仍能见到开遍山野的花朵。
    光辉的历史
    提到埃塞俄比亚，人们就不能不想到二十年前埃塞俄比亚人民英勇抵抗意大利法西斯侵略者的光辉事迹。1935年10月，意大利法西斯侵略军队入侵埃塞俄比亚，人民顽强地起来捍卫自己的国土。一个月之后，埃塞俄比亚军队退入南部，把侵略军困在山区。最后，墨索里尼只能以施放毒气的野蛮手段来赢得战争。直到1936年5月，意军才占领了亚的斯亚贝巴。
    但是埃塞俄比亚人民是不屈的。1941年在埃塞俄比亚又重升起了自己的国旗。如今在亚的斯亚贝巴，人们看到“二月十九日广场”上树立着一个插入云霄的“二月十九日纪念碑”。二月十九，这是纪念意大利占领军对人民施行大屠杀的日子。两个勇敢的埃塞俄比亚人向意大利将军投掷炸弹，意大利法西斯匪徒立即以大屠杀来进行报复，一天之间，屠杀了十五万埃塞俄比亚人，其中大部分是妇孺。在亚的斯亚贝巴还有一个存放殉难者骨灰的教堂，这都是埃塞俄比亚人民英勇斗争的历史见证。
    在亚的斯亚贝巴，我们听到埃塞俄比亚艺术家法格里的悲壮的歌声。这是一首悼念抗意战争中的烈士的歌曲，它激起人们对那些为埃塞俄比亚的独立和自由而英勇牺牲的烈士们的尊敬和怀念。
    万人争看中国歌舞
    亚的斯亚贝巴的居民从来没有遇到过这样多的中国人。这些宾客是受了六亿中国人民的委托来用他们的艺术语言向埃塞俄比亚人民表达友谊的。
    在访问埃塞俄比亚王国的十七天中，我国艺术家在亚的斯亚贝巴的海尔·塞拉西一世剧院共演出了十场。剧院有一千二百个座位，每一场都客满了。大约亚的斯亚贝巴的每三十个居民中有一个人观看了中国的艺术表演。但是每场开演以后，剧院外面仍蜂拥着人群，剧院大门的几块大玻璃都给人群挤碎了。人们说，中国艺术家的演出掀起了亚的斯亚贝巴居民文化生活的一个巨大的浪潮。
    亚的斯亚贝巴的报刊给予中国艺术家的演出以热烈的评论。“今日埃塞俄比亚报”写道：“埃塞俄比亚人民很容易理解中国人民的艺术语言，中国艺术家的演出使埃塞俄比亚人民有很好的机会去了解一个正在发生着巨大变化的古老国家的文化传统。”
    他们遇到了真正的朋友
    在演出时，我经常遇到一个名叫阿巴塔的电工。他是管理舞台灯光的。他看了十场中国艺术表演。阿巴塔对我说：“我从来没有遇到过中国人，现在看了你们的演出，使我太感动了。帝国主义时常说你们坏话，但是我看得出来，你们是我们的真正的朋友。可惜你们在这里的时间太短促了。”阿巴塔说：“你知道，我们埃塞俄比亚人是多么喜欢你们的艺术表演！以前西方国家有些剧团曾到这里来演出，剧院从来都没有满座过，有时只有几十个观众。可是你们的表演使埃塞俄比亚人入了迷，你看剧院的大门都被挤破了。”
    在我接触许多人的过程中，我体会到，埃塞俄比亚人民对中国人民是很友好的。我曾访问过一位埃塞俄比亚青年画家阿费威尔，他正为宫廷作画。他说：“你们从遥远的中国来，我感觉到，你们是我的朋友，而且我非常喜爱你们的艺术。我也希望将来有机会去访问你们的国家。”
    我也曾访问了埃塞俄比亚国立图书馆。那里有五万册藏书；其中包括一些已有八百年历史的古书，图书馆副馆长说：“我们很骄傲，因为我们有五万多册藏书。但是可惜这里没有中国的书籍。”后来中国文化艺术代表团赠给了图书馆一套中国历代的名画和一些中国书籍及画册，副馆长高兴地接受了这些礼品。他说：“这些赠书象征了中国人民和埃塞俄比亚人民之间的友谊。”
    一个埃塞俄比亚人告诉我说：“在这个国家，不欢迎你们访问的是驻亚的斯亚贝巴的美国大使馆。他们竭力想阻挠你们的访问，但是他们发现无能为力了。”
    别有用心的美国人
    提起美国人，埃塞俄比亚人莫不摇头叹息。
    美国势力是在第二次大战以后才渗入的。1952年埃塞俄比亚接受了美国的所谓“第四点计划”的“援助”，于是“第四点计划”的美国人员大量渗入这个国家。据一个熟悉情况的人告诉我说，约有一百个美国“顾问”和“专家”留在埃塞俄比亚。他们对于如何帮助埃塞俄比亚人民摆脱贫困和经济落后是丝毫也不感到兴趣的。他们并不关心帮助经济落后的埃塞俄比亚发展自己的工业，而是设法扩展美国垄断资本的势力。
    一个埃塞俄比亚人告诉我，美国人在厄立特里亚首府阿斯玛拉附近有着好几个空军基地。有一次我看到一架美国的军用机停留在亚的斯亚贝巴的机场上。有人对我说，这就是从埃塞俄比亚境内的空军基地飞来的美国空军飞机。
    有消息说，华盛顿统治集团正处心积虑地策划着一个泛非侵略联盟的阴谋，企图把埃塞俄比亚当作它入侵非洲的垫脚石。但是，热爱自由的埃塞俄比亚人民，是不会听人摆布自己的命运的。（附图片）
