Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: The Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement convened a national specialized conference on tobacco and bast fiber in Beijing from May 18th to June 4th to arrange the procurement, allocation, and supply work for the peak season of tobacco and bast fiber marketing in the second half of this year.

According to reports from various provinces at the meeting, due to the basic completion of agricultural cooperation throughout the country and the rapid surge in agricultural production, it is estimated that national flue-cured tobacco production will increase by about 90% this year, and bast fiber production will increase by about 43%. The time of market availability and quantities of tobacco and bast fiber will be earlier and more concentrated. Based on this situation, the meeting arranged for a 74.37% increase in the tobacco procurement task for the second half of the year compared to the actual procurement quantity in the same period last year, and a 70.97% increase in bast fiber compared to the actual procurement quantity in the same period last year.

The meeting focused on discussing the various preparatory tasks for the peak season of tobacco and bast fiber procurement, and particularly requested active improvements in procurement methods to adapt to the new situation of tobacco and bast fiber production and marketing this year. The meeting believes that: first, all preparations should be made, and the work of procurement stations and points should be strengthened to facilitate agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers in selling tobacco and bast fiber, avoiding the congestion that occurred during the peak season in the past. In areas where warehouse capacity and cadre strength are insufficient, for agricultural production cooperatives with large tobacco and bast fiber production, good technology, and warehousing conditions, the method of "guiding production cooperatives to grade themselves, inspect at the cooperative, bundle at the cooperative, store at the cooperative, and allocate by the cooperative" can be adopted. For agricultural production cooperatives with large production quantities but poor technical conditions and warehousing facilities, the method of "advance payment for goods and signing of contracts for phased and batch procurement" can be adopted to meet the needs of farmers to sell tobacco and bast fiber during the peak season. The meeting conducted relatively detailed research on the review and cleanup of flue-cured tobacco and ramie pre-purchase work, the training of tobacco and bast fiber grading technicians, and coordinating with relevant departments to solve the problems of insufficient warehouse capacity and processing capacity, as well as the lack of packaging materials.

The meeting also summarized the past situation of mastering tobacco and bast fiber grading standards and criticized the practices of excessively high or low grading and chaotic procurement grading. The meeting emphasized that correctly mastering the grading standards for agricultural product procurement is one of the keys to embodying national procurement and price policies and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and requires all localities to pay special attention to this work. For how to overcome the confusion in flue-cured tobacco grades, high moisture content, many impurities, and the bias of only valuing length and neglecting quality in raw bast fiber in the future, the meeting put forward improvement opinions and re-formulated a new draft grading standard for hemp and ramie based on the spirit of combining length and quality.

    今年烤烟将增产90％，麻类将增产43％
    农产品采购部准备大量收购烟麻
    新华社10日讯　农产品采购部五月十八日到六月四日在北京召开全国烟麻专业会议，安排了今年下半年烟麻上市旺季的采购调拨供应工作。
    根据会上各省反映，由于全国农业合作化的基本完成，农业生产的急剧高涨，预计今年全国烤烟生产大约将比去年增加90％，麻类生产将比去年增加43％，烟、麻的上市时间、数量将更提前和集中。根据这种情况，会议安排的下半年烟叶采购任务比去年同期实际收购数量增加74.37％，麻类比去年同期实际收购数量增加70.97％。
    会议着重讨论了烟麻收购旺季的各项准备工作，特别要求积极改进采购方法，以适应今年烟麻生产上市的新情况。会议认为：首先应该作好一切准备，加强采购站、点工作，以便利农业合作社和个体农民出售烟麻，避免过去旺季收购中的拥挤现象。在仓库容量、干部力量不足的地区，对烟麻产量大、技术较好和有仓储条件的农业生产合作社，可以采取“指导生产社自行分级，到社验收，在社成包，就社保管、由社调拨”的办法；对生产数量大，但是技术条件、仓储设备较差的农业生产合作社，可以采取“预付货款，签订分期分批收购合同”办法，以满足农民旺季出售烟麻的要求。对于烤烟、苎麻预购工作的复查和清理、培养训练烟麻分级技术人员、配合有关部门解决仓库容量和加工力量不足以及包装物料缺乏等问题，会议都进行了比较细致的研究。
    会议并且总结了过去掌握烟麻分级标准的情况，批判了掌握等级偏高偏低及采购等级混乱的做法。会议着重指出，正确掌握农产品采购的等级标准，是体现国家采购和价格政策、巩固工农联盟的关键之一，要求各地特别重视这一工作。对于今后如何克服烤烟等级混乱、水份大、杂质多，以及对原麻只重视长度、忽视品质的偏向，提出了改进意见，并且根据长度和品质相结合的精神，重新制订了新的大麻、苎麻分级标准草案。
