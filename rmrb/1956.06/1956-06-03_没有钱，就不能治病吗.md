To the Editor:

    Gao Wanfang, the wife of Xia Hongchang, a worker at the Jinbing Phosphorus Mine in Xin Hailian City, Jiangsu Province, contracted acute gastroenteritis on the night of February 18th. Xia Hongchang and his younger brother carried the patient to the Xin Hailian Municipal Hospital for treatment overnight. Because they were in a hurry when they got up, they forgot to bring money, and the registration clerk of the Municipal Hospital, Zhao Sifa, refused to allow them to register. At this time, Gao Wanfang's stomach was in unbearable pain; Xia Hongchang asked to register and treat her first, and the registration and medical fees would be paid later. But Zhao Sifa actually said: "If you don't have money, don't see a doctor!" Xia Hongchang had no choice but to find a way to borrow some money to pay the registration fee. Who knew that the hospital staff then demanded that the laboratory fee be paid first before the patient could be treated. Xia Hongchang explained his specific situation and repeatedly begged the hospital to treat the patient first; but this still could not move the hospital staff's heart of stone. Xia Hongchang had to go out again to find a way to borrow money, and as a result, it was already 11:30 in the morning when the admission procedures were completed.

    After this ordeal, the patient was finally admitted to the hospital. However, the hospital only allowed an intern to inject the patient with a caffeine shot and five milliliters of sulfadiazine, and then left the patient alone. At about 10 o'clock that night, the patient's condition worsened, and Xia Hongchang asked the hospital to send a doctor to make a careful diagnosis as soon as possible. It wasn't until 12 o'clock that a doctor named Kong Xiantong came to the patient and gave her a chlortetracycline capsule. But it was too late at this time, and the patient died five minutes later.

    The Xin Hailian Municipal Hospital should be held responsible for Gao Wanfang's death. The relevant leading organs of Xin Hailian City should seriously deal with this issue.

    没有钱，就不能治病吗编辑同志：
    江苏省新海连市锦并磷矿工人夏洪昌的妻子高万芳在二月十八日深夜得了急性肠胃炎。夏洪昌和他的弟弟连夜把病人抬到新海连市立医院去就诊。由于他们在起身的时候很匆忙，忘了带钱，市立医院挂号员赵斯法就不让挂号。这时，高万芳肚子疼痛难忍；夏洪昌就要求先给挂号诊治，挂号费和医疗费在以后再付。但是赵斯法竟说：“没有钱，就别看病！”夏洪昌没有办法，只得临时设法借了一些钱来付挂号费。谁知道，医院的工作人员又提出还要先付化验费才能为病人诊治。夏洪昌说明自己的具体情况，并且再三恳求院方先给病人看病；但是这仍然不能打动医院工作人员的铁石心肠。夏洪昌只好又出去设法借钱，结果等办完入院手续已经是上午十一点半钟了。
    经过这一番周折，病人总算入院了。但是，医院只让一个实习医士给病人注射了一支咖啡因和五毫升磺胺嘧啶，就把病人丢下不管了。当晚十时左右，病人的病情更加恶化，夏洪昌要求院方赶快派一位大夫来仔细诊断一下。直到十二时，一个名叫孔宪东的大夫才来到病人跟前，给病人灌下了一颗金霉素。但是，这时候时间已经晚了，五分钟以后病人就死去了。
    对于高万芳的死，新海连市立医院应该负责。新海连市有关领导机关应该严肃处理这一问题。
