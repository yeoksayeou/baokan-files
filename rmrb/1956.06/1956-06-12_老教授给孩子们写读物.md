    老教授给孩子们写读物
    本报讯　北京师范大学中国语言文学系的很多老教授订出计划，在教学之余挤时间为孩子们写作或翻译读物。
    人民口头创作组教授钟敬文将在年内为孩子们改写出两篇民间传说，并且还要写关于怎样把民间故事改写成儿童读物的研究论文。外国文学教研组主任穆木天教授计划每月要翻译两篇到四篇外国儿童文学。现在他已开始准备为学龄前的儿童翻译苏联马尔夏克和米哈尔科夫的儿童诗。中国古典文学教研组主任谭丕模教授等九人将专门翻译适合孩子们读的白居易、李白、杜甫等的诗四、五十首。中国语言文学系系主任黄药眠教授也准备为孩子们创作。
    北京师范大学中国语言文学系、教育系等一百多学生也分别组织了有关儿童文学的科学研究小组。
