    Commentary: A New Approach to Breaking the Impasse on Disarmament

    A pressing issue of universal concern to people of all nations is: when can the long-standing deadlock on the disarmament issue finally be broken? This question arises from the fact that disarmament negotiations have yielded no results, the arms race continues unabated, and the burden of military spending is ever-increasing, which people of all nations can no longer endure. The letters sent by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin on June 6 to the leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, West Germany, Canada, and Turkey offer the most promising answer to this question. He suggested that countries need not wait for an international disarmament agreement to take concrete actions to reduce armaments, as the Soviet Union has recently done.

    The Soviet Union's new proposal on the disarmament issue has understandably attracted great attention and enthusiastic praise from public opinion in various countries. This initiative aligns with the current development of the international situation and the universal desire of people of all nations to reduce burdens.

    Disarmament negotiations have been ongoing for ten years, and the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee has held eighty-six meetings. Despite the Soviet Union's unremitting efforts, which have facilitated rapprochement and consensus on several major issues, Western countries have repeatedly backtracked, preventing the negotiations from reaching an agreement. In this context, the Soviet government's suggestion that countries independently reduce their armaments is extremely constructive. If all countries, particularly the North Atlantic Treaty nations with their massive armaments, could adopt this suggestion, it would dispel feelings of distrust and insecurity among nations, thereby paving the way for a comprehensive disarmament agreement.

    The current development of the international situation has created broad prospects for breaking the impasse on the disarmament issue. In the past, forces pursuing the Cold War policy intensified the arms race and erected military barriers around the world, particularly in Europe, the Near and Middle East, and the Far East, creating division, hostility, and bloodshed, causing a tense international atmosphere and bringing the grave threat of a new war to the people of all countries. However, thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries and peoples, especially the series of peaceful steps taken by the Soviet Union, international tensions have eased to some extent, relations between major powers have improved, and trust among countries has strengthened. The recent talks between Britain and the Soviet Union, and France and the Soviet Union, are important signs that the international situation continues to ease. In this context, it is highly possible for countries to begin implementing large-scale disarmament, cease expanding armaments, and devote substantial human and material resources to economic development and improving people's livelihoods. The Soviet Union has taken the initiative in this regard, setting an excellent example. Even some responsible government officials in the West cannot but admit that the Soviet Union's decision to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million is a huge contribution to the cause of peace. U.S. representative to the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, Stassen, said that the Soviet measure is "an important decision that helps to expand the prospects for lasting peace." Given this, it is simply not convincing to say that Western countries cannot take corresponding steps.

    The results of the recent talks between Britain and the Soviet Union, and France and the Soviet Union, both indicate that their efforts should be directed towards striving to stop the dangerous arms race and finding steps to achieve disarmament; they unanimously believe that such joint efforts will help to further ease international tensions and strengthen trust between countries. This conclusion reached by these three major countries is fully in line with their own and the peaceful interests of the people of all countries.

    Large-scale disarmament will immediately alleviate the burden of huge military expenditures on the people and allow the economies of some countries, which have been teetering on the brink due to long-term arms expansion and war preparations, to recover. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan has publicly admitted that reducing military spending by 50% "would solve a major problem for the Treasury." Currently, the crisis of inflation in Britain has reached a serious stage, and only a substantial reduction in non-productive huge military expenditures can improve the situation. As for countries like Turkey, its economy has been almost crushed by the heavy military spending. According to statistics, military spending, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the budget, has increased the national debt to more than three billion lira and caused runaway inflation, leading to a drastic deterioration in people's lives. For these countries, taking concrete disarmament measures immediately is already very necessary.

    Not only that, opening the deadlock on the disarmament issue can also make it easier to resolve other international issues. Bulganin's letter pointed out that the Soviet Union has decided to disband three air divisions and other combat units stationed in the German Democratic Republic, totaling more than 30,000 people. If the United States, Britain, and France also reduce the number of their armed forces stationed in Germany, it would greatly help solve the problem of German reunification. Everyone knows that every step that is conducive to resolving the problem of German reunification will consolidate peace and security in Europe and the world.

    It is obvious that large-scale disarmament will further ease the international situation and promote peaceful economic development in all countries. However, it is regrettable to see that in some countries, a small number of influential figures insist on continuing the arms race and deliberately belittle the great significance of the Soviet Union's disarmament. For example, in the United States, some people insist that they "cannot find anything new" in Bulganin's letter and rashly describe it as "a further attempt to achieve propaganda purposes." These forces, who are bent on evading disarmament, are also eager to pretend to be enthusiastic about striving for an international disarmament agreement, saying that they cannot agree to "substitute for a disarmament agreement." This approach, which can only maintain the deadlock on the disarmament issue, should be jointly condemned by world public opinion.

    Anyone with a sense of reality should not ignore that the Soviet initiative reflects the common aspirations of all people who desire peace and peaceful coexistence. The enormous moral force of this initiative lies in the fact that it is consistent in word and deed. The Soviet Union has taken the initiative to carry out significant disarmament actions and has put forward sincere suggestions hoping that all countries will disarm. Now it is time for Western countries to take practical action.

### 论打开裁军问题僵局的新途径

    评论打开裁军问题僵局的新途径
    各国人民目前普遍关心的迫切问题是：裁军问题的长期僵局，到底要到什么时候才能够打开呢？这个问题的提出，是由于裁军谈判迄无结果，而军备竞赛继续进行，军费负担有加无已，各国人民已经再也忍受不下去了。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在六月六日分别写给美、英、法、意、西德、加拿大和土耳其等国领导人的信，对这个问题提供了最有希望的答案。他建议各国不必等待国际裁军协定就采取裁减军备的具体行动，像苏联最近所已经采取的那样。
    苏联这个对裁军问题的新建议，已在各国舆论中引起了极大的重视和热烈的称赞，这是完全可以理解的。因为这个倡议符合于当前国际局势的发展，符合于各国人民强烈要求减轻负担的普遍愿望。
    裁军谈判已有十年，联合国裁军小组委员会也已开了八十六次会议，尽管苏联的不懈努力，曾促成了在几个重大问题上的接近和一致，但是西方国家却不惜一再开倒车，使得谈判始终未能达成协议。在这种情况下，苏联政府提出的各国自行裁减军备的建议，是极其富于建设性的。各国，特别是拥有巨大军备的北大西洋公约国家，如果能够采纳这个建议，就可以消除各国间的不信任和不安全的感觉，从而为全面裁军的协定铺平道路。
    目前国际局势的发展，为打开裁军问题的僵局创造了宽广的前景。过去，执行冷战政策的势力，加紧进行军备竞赛，并在世界各地，特别是在欧洲、中近东和远东地区，竖立军事壁垒，制造分裂、敌对和流血，造成了国际局势的紧张气氛，给各国人民带来了新战争的严重威胁。但是由于爱好和平的国家和人民的努力，特别是苏联所采取的一系列的和平步骤，国际紧张局势已有了一定的缓和，大国之间的关系已有所改进，各国间的信任已有了加强。最近英苏、法苏的会谈，是国际形势继续趋向和缓的重要标志。在这种情况下，各国开始实行大量裁军，停止扩张军备，以便把大量人力物力用于发展经济，改善人民生活，已具有极大的可能性。苏联在这方面就已采取主动，做出了出色的榜样。连西方一些负责的政府官员也不能不承认：苏联裁减一百二十万军队的决定是对和平事业的巨大贡献。美国出席联合国裁军小组委员会会议的代表史塔生就说：苏联的这一措施，是“有助于扩大持久和平的前景的重要决定”。既然如此，要说西方国家就是不能采取相应的步骤，是无论如何不能令人信服的。
    最近英苏、法苏会谈的结果都表明它们的努力方向，应当是争取停止危险的军备竞赛，找寻实现裁军的步骤；它们并一致认为这样的共同努力，将有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势，加强国与国间的信任。这三大国得出的这个结论，完全符合于它们和各国人民的和平利益。
    大量裁减军备将会立即减轻人民肩上的巨额军事开支的负担，并使一些国家已经因为长期扩军备战而险象环生的经济得到宽舒。英国财政大臣麦克米伦就曾公开承认，缩减军事开支50％，“就可以解决国库的一个主要问题。”目前，英国通货膨胀的危机已经达到了严重的阶段，只有大量削减非生产性的巨额军事开支，才能使情况有所改善。至于像土耳其这样的国家，它的经济已几乎要给沉重的军费压垮了。据统计，差不多占到预算三分之二的军事开支，已使国债增加到了三十亿里拉以上，并造成恶性通货膨胀，人民生活极度恶化。对于这些国家来说，立即采取裁军的具体措施已经是非常必要的了。
    不仅这样，裁军问题僵局的打开，还可以使得其他国际问题的解决变得更加容易一些。布尔加宁的信指出，苏联已决定解散驻扎在德意志民主共和国境内总数三万多人的三个空军师和其他战斗部队，如果美、英、法三国也减少自己驻德武装部队的数量，那就会大大有助于解决统一德国的问题。大家知道，有利于解决统一德国问题的每一个步骤，都会巩固欧洲和世界的和平和安全。
    显而易见，大量裁减军备将会使国际局势进一步趋向缓和，并推动各国经济和平发展。但是，人们遗憾地看到，在某些国家中，少数有势力的人物，偏要继续维持军备竞赛，并故意贬低苏联裁减军备的重大意义。例如，在美国，就有人硬说从布尔加宁的信中“找不出任何新的东西”，并轻率地把它说成是什么“达到宣传目的的进一步企图”。这些一味打算逃避裁军的势力，还急于想装扮成热心争取签订国际裁军协议的角色，说什么他们不能同意“代替裁军协定”。这种只能保持裁军问题的僵局的作法，应该遭到全世界公众舆论的共同谴责。
    任何有现实感的人，都不应忽视：苏联的倡议反映了所有希望和平和和平共处的人们的共同愿望。这个倡议的巨大道义力量，还在于它是言行一致的。苏联主动采取了巨大的裁军行动，提出希望各国都来裁军的真诚建议。现在该由西方国家采取实际行动了。
