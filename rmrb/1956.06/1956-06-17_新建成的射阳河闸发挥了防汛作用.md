    (Our newspaper dispatch from Nanjing) The Sheyang River Sluice Gates in Jiangsu Province, completed on May 23, have already withstood their first test during the continuous heavy rains. After the thirty-five sluice gates of the Sheyang River Sluice Gates were opened, the water level of the Sheyang River, which flows through four counties, has dropped from 0.82 meters to 0.15 meters, allowing the accumulated water in the farmland of Binhai, Sheyang, Funing, and Jianhu counties to be drained away as it accumulates, basically eliminating the threat of flooding. Currently, Yancheng, Xinghua and other counties are clearing obstacles such as reeds and fish weirs from the upper reaches of the Sheyang River to accelerate the drainage speed.

    In this flood control struggle, the large and small water conservancy projects in Jiangsu Province have played a significant role, enabling most of the more than ten million mu of waterlogged farmland in the province to drain the accumulated water in a timely manner within three or four days after rainfall. The large and medium-sized sluice gates in the Yancheng Special District were completed at the end of May and began draining water into the sea in early June, saving more than 50,000 mu of cotton and wheat fields from damage. It is estimated that the benefits from this drainage alone are more than three times the investment in the sluice gate project.

### 新建成的射阳河闸发挥了防汛作用

    新建成的射阳河闸发挥了防汛作用
    本报南京电　五月二十三日建成的江苏省射阳河闸在连日的大雨中，已经经受了第一次考验。射阳河闸三十五个闸孔开放后，流经四个县的射阳河水位已经由0.82公尺下降到0.15公尺，使滨海、射阳、阜宁、建湖四县农田的积水能随积随泄，基本上免除了涝灾。目前，盐城、兴化等县正在清除射阳河上游的苇草、鱼簖等障碍，以加快排水速度。
    在这次防汛的斗争中，江苏省的大小型水利工程都发挥了很大的作用，使全省一千多万亩受涝农田，在降雨后三、四天内大部分地区都能及时排出积水。盐城专区的大中闸是在五月底完工的，六月初就开始排水入海，使附近五万多亩棉田、麦田免受损失，估计单这一项排水收益就相当于该闸工程投资的三倍多。
