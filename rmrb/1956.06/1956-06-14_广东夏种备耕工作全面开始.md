    Guangdong's Summer Planting Preparations Begin in Full Swing

    (Our newspaper Guangzhou, June 13th) Guangdong's summer planting preparations have fully commenced throughout the province. From the Chaoshan Plain in the east to the mountainous areas in the north, the broad masses of farmers are sowing, raising seedlings, accumulating fertilizer, and learning advanced techniques. Chao'an and Jieyang counties and the Leizhou Peninsula, which are progressing relatively quickly, have basically completed sowing, more than ten days earlier than last year. Shaoguan Prefecture, aiming for a comprehensive double-cropping rice harvest this year, has treated 90% of the 6.8 million jin of rice seeds already sown through seed selection, disinfection, and soaking. In the Pearl River Delta region, a campaign to accumulate 3,000 jin of fertilizer per mu has been launched, with more than 120 agricultural cooperatives adopting high-temperature composting and green manure methods to prepare large quantities of fertilizer for late-season rice. The province has already accumulated more than 100 million dan of various local and miscellaneous fertilizers.

    To ensure timely summer planting, local leading departments are making proper arrangements to ensure that agricultural and sideline production do not interfere with each other. Technical extension stations in various places are also actively helping farmers identify seeds and imparting techniques for managing rice paddies. Before the summer planting, the province will train 1.3 million rice transplanting experts, striving to basically achieve small-bunch close planting and single-plant close planting on the province's more than 42 million mu of late-season rice.

    广东夏种备耕工作全面开始
    本报广州13日电　广东各地夏种备耕工作已经全面开始了。从东部的潮汕平原到北部的山区，广大农民正在播种、育秧、积肥和学习先进技术。进度较快的潮安、揭阳两县和雷州半岛已基本完成播种，比去年提早十几天。今年要全面争取双季稻丰收的韶关专区，在已播的六百八十万斤稻种中，有90％经过选种、消毒和浸种。珠江三角洲地区掀起了每亩积肥三千斤的运动，有一百二十多个农业社采用高温堆肥，沤制绿肥等制肥方法，为晚稻准备了大量肥料。全省已积得的各种土杂肥料约有一亿多担以上。
    为了保证适时夏种，各地领导部门正在妥善安排力量，使农业与副业生产做到两不误。各地的技术推广站也积极地帮助农民鉴定种子，传授秧田管理技术。在夏种之前，全省将要训练一百三十万名插秧能手，争取全省四千二百多万亩晚稻要基本上实现小科密植和单株密植。
