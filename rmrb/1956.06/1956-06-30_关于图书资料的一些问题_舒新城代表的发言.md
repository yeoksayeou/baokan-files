    Some Issues Concerning Books and Documents
    ——Speech by Representative Shu Xincheng
    In May and June of this year, I inspected secondary school education and library resources in Shanghai. Proposals concerning the work, life, and health of primary and secondary school teachers have been submitted separately by Representatives Zhou Gucheng and Xu Zhucheng. Now, I will simply report on the situation and problems related to library resources.
    I inspected five libraries in Shanghai: the Shanghai Library, the Science and Technology Library, the Historical Documents Library, the Newspaper and Periodical Library, and the Children's Library. Together with Representative Zhou Gucheng, I inspected the People's Library. Furthermore, Representative Zhou, Shanghai Representative Wang Guoxiu and I inspected the Xujiahui Catholic Church Library, the Royal Asiatic Society Library, and the YMCA Library.
    Before liberation, Shanghai did not have national public libraries. After liberation, the People's Government centralized scattered books and documents and took over several private libraries, establishing the six specialized libraries mentioned above, which have made certain contributions to both general public reading and specialized research. Since the Central Government put forward the call to advance towards science, the Shanghai Library has added a reference reading room, the People's Library has set up a meeting room for experts, and the Science and Technology, Historical Documents, and Newspaper and Periodical Libraries have actively cooperated with scientific research by providing materials for researchers. The Catholic Church Library, with its rich collection of modern history and Eastern studies materials, as well as the Royal Asiatic Society Library and the YMCA Library, can also be accessed by experts. These have been of great help to scientific research, but some problems have also arisen.
      Pay attention to the acquisition of old books and periodicals
    First, Shanghai has a wealth of materials from various sources. Pre-liberation companies, foreign firms, and especially foreign institutions such as HSBC and Standard Oil, had many professional books and documents related to various aspects of China. Recently, the city discovered 2,000 copies of an English report on Pacific issues. Someone offered to sell them to the Historical Documents Library for two yuan each. The library's monthly book purchase budget was only 500 yuan, making it impossible to acquire them. Now, I have heard that some have been bought privately and scattered. This situation is even more common with old Chinese books and is a nationwide problem, which the cultural departments are aware of. It is hoped that the Ministry of Culture will quickly formulate a unified plan to conduct a large-scale "stocktaking" of books and documents across the country, and gradually compile a national catalog of books and documents for the reference of scientific researchers nationwide. For the acquisition of old books and periodicals, it is hoped that a special budget will be allocated and that the comrades responsible for the work will be given the authority to select and purchase, so as to prevent the loss of materials. Regarding waste paper being recycled, it is hoped that commercial departments will consult with cultural departments to allow them to select and assess materials before they are recycled.
      Reproduce the most important reference books and periodicals
    Second, during the inspection, I saw many people from various organizations coming to the Newspaper and Periodical, Historical Documents, Shanghai, and People's Libraries to consult materials. Many newspapers, in the words of the staff, were already "covered in scars and unrecognizable." Some were even "shattered to pieces and beyond recovery." The Shen Bao before 1900, The Chinese Repository monthly magazine founded in 1832, The English-language North-China Herald after 1850, The Journal Asiatique founded in French in 1822, and other books and periodicals from the first half of the nineteenth century are mostly weathered and crumble into fragments upon touch, making them impossible to read. It is hoped that the cultural departments will formulate regulations to strictly limit reading of these periodicals and newspapers and, at the same time, quickly use photography to make microfilm copies to preserve them and duplicate several copies for major libraries across the country for expert reference. On the other hand, there is a great shortage of valuable books and periodicals from foreign countries, especially capitalist countries, and subscriptions to periodicals are often interrupted. I hope that in addition to increasing purchases and supplements, the most important reference books and periodicals should be reproduced and distributed to specialized libraries.
  Improve the professional
              and political level of library staff
    Third, the library staff are now enthusiastically demanding to improve their professional and political level, and especially feel that their professional knowledge is insufficient. They may abandon some important materials because they are unaware of their importance, lack specialized subject knowledge, and are unfamiliar with cataloging, making it difficult to assist experts in their research. It is hoped that the cultural departments will open professional training classes and schools for librarians and, even more so, search for elderly intellectuals in cultural and historical institutions and various social circles to take on part of the work of identifying, organizing, and editing books and documents. Bookbinding and repair technicians are already extremely rare. This time, I only saw that the Science and Technology Library has specialized personnel and equipment. It is hoped that the cultural and educational departments will pay attention to these technical personnel and make an effort to train them.
        Let books that cannot be seen and
    those hidden in famous mountains serve scientific research
    Fourth, among the six libraries in Shanghai, only the Science and Technology Library is housed in a library building built decades ago. The other libraries are not suitable for library use. The largest Shanghai Library is using the old horse racing track left by the imperialists, and the People's Library is using the buildings of their old dog racing track. The stacks are not ventilated, are extremely humid, and the space is small. Nearly a million books are sleeping in boxes and cannot be seen. The reading rooms are overcrowded everywhere. Sometimes, people have to wait two or three hours outside to enter the library. The young readers of the Children's Library often have to wait half a day on Sundays to enter the library. The Newspaper and Periodical Library was allocated several carts of old newspapers by the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee, which were piled up in a temporary room next to which a family lives. Not only can they not spread out the newspapers to organize them, but they are also constantly worried about fire. It is understood that there are also more than 3 million books hidden in boxes in Beijing, and 400,000 books in Hunan are "hidden in famous mountains" – Mount Heng. Similar situations exist in other places as well. Not only can they not serve scientific research, but they also need to be "rid of the four pests" – insects, rats, dampness, and dust. Last year, the cultural and educational expenditure only used more than 80 percent of the budgeted amount. Under the principle of thrift, can a portion of the funds be allocated to build some suitable libraries in major cities across the country, so that books that cannot be seen and those hidden in famous mountains can be concentrated in several places to serve scientific research!
    The organization, supply, and preservation of books and documents are important conditions for carrying out scientific research, especially social science research. These problems were only discovered in one place, and the problems related to books and documents across the country must be even greater. It is hoped that the relevant departments will give comprehensive consideration, solve them one by one, provide more help to scientific researchers, so that the contending hundred schools can have more nourishment, and those who are good at contending can become experts.

    关于图书资料的一些问题
    ——舒新城代表的发言
    今年五、六月间，我在上海视察中学教育和图书资料两个项目，关于中小学教师的工作、生活、健康问题，已与周谷城、徐铸成代表另有提案，现在只简单汇报关于图书资料的情况和问题。
    我曾视察上海市的上海、科学技术、历史文献、报刊、儿童5个图书馆，并和周谷城代表共同视察人民图书馆，和周代表及上海市代表王国秀视察徐家汇天主堂藏书楼、亚洲文会书库、基督教协进会图书馆。
    解放前上海没有国家的公共图书馆。解放后人民政府把散在各处的图书集中起来，并接办了几个私立图书馆而建立上面的6个专业性图书馆，对于人民的一般阅览和专门研究都有一定的贡献。自从中央提出向科学进军的号召以后，上海图书馆增辟参考阅览室，人民图书馆为专家辟集会室，科学技术、历史文献、报刊3个图书馆都积极配合科学研究，为研究工作者供应资料。对近代史及东方研究资料收藏丰富的天主堂藏书楼，和亚洲文会书库、协进会图书馆，也可以由专家入内阅览。这些对科学研究都有很大的帮助，但另一方面也随着产生了一些问题。
      注意收购旧的图书报刊
    第一、上海各方面的资料很多，解放前的公司、洋行，尤其是外国人的机构如汇丰银行、美孚洋行等等，都有许多专业的及有关中国各方面资料调查的藏书。最近市上发现有关太平洋问题的英文报告2，000册，当时曾有人向历史文献图书馆兜售，每本索价2元。该馆购书预算每月只有500元，无法收购，现在听说由私人分散买去一部分。这种情形在中国旧书方面更经常发现，并且是全国性的，文化部门也曾知道。希望文化部赶快订定统一规划，把全国各地的图书资料，作一次大规模的“清家底”工作，并且逐步编印全国图书资料总目，供应全国科学研究工作者参考。对收购旧的图书报刊，希望制定特别预算，给予负责工作同志以选购的权力，以免资料散失。对于回炉的废纸，希望与商业部门协商，让文化部门先行鉴选后，方许回炉。
      复印最重要的参考书刊
    第二、在视察时，见许多机关派人到报刊、历史文献、上海、人民各图书馆查阅资料者甚多，很多报纸用工作同志的话来说，已“满身伤痕，面目全非”。更有一些已经“粉身碎骨，不能复苏”了。1900年以前的申报，1832年创刊的英文中国从报月刊，1850年以后的英文字林西报，1822年创刊的法文亚洲杂志等等，及十九世纪前半期书刊，大部分都被风化，一触即成碎片，不能翻阅，希望文化部门对于这些报刊的重要者，一面制定规章，严格限制翻阅，一面赶快用照相摄成软片，保存下来，并复制若干分藏全国各大图书馆供专家参考。另一方面，外国尤其是资本主义国家有价值的书刊大大不够，期刊大概中断，我希望增购、补充以外，要把最重要的参考书刊复印，分给专门图书馆。
  提高图书馆工作人员的业务
              政治水平
    第三、现在图书馆工作人员都热烈地要求提高业务政治水平，尤其感到业务知识不够，对于有些重要资料因不知其重要性而放弃，无专门学科门径，不熟悉目录学，对于专家研究工作难于帮助。希望文化部门开设图书馆专业训练班及学校，更希望在文史馆和社会各方面搜罗各项老年知识分子，分负一部分鉴别、整理、编辑图书资料工作。关于装订、修补图书的技工，已经是凤毛麟角。此次只看到科学技术图书馆有专门人员及设备，希望文教部门重视此项技术人员，加意培养。
        让不能露面和藏在
    名山的图书为科学研究服务
    第四、上海市6个图书馆中只有一个科学技术图书馆是几十年前的图书馆建筑，其他各馆均不适合图书馆之用；最大的上海图书馆是利用帝国主义者遗留下来的跑马厅，人民图书馆是利用他们遗留的跑狗场的房屋，书库不透气，潮湿异常，而且地方狭小，有近百万册图书睡在箱子里，无法露面。阅览室到处有人满之患，有时要在门外等候二、三小时方能入馆阅览。儿童图书馆的小读者，在星期天等候半日不能入馆的也是常事。报刊图书馆由文物保管会拨去几车旧报纸，堆在一间临时房间，旁边住着一家老百姓，他们不独无法把报纸摊开整理，而且时时提心吊胆怕失火。据了解北京也有300万册以上的图书躲在箱里，湖南有40万册图书“藏之名山”——南岳。其他各地也有类此情形。它们不独不能为科学研究服务，而且要给它们“除四害”——虫蛀、鼠咬、潮浸、尘封。去年文教经费只用去预算额的百分之八十几，能不能在节约原则之下，拨一部分经费，在国内各大城市建筑一些合用的图书馆，让不能露面和藏在名山的图书集中在若干地方为科学研究服务呢！
    图书资料的整理、供应、保藏，是开展科学研究尤其是社会科学研究的重要条件。这些问题只是由一个地方所发现，全国有关图书资料的问题当更多，希望有关部门予以全面考虑，逐一解决，给予科学研究者以更多的帮助，使争鸣的百家有更多的滋养料，而善鸣成家。
