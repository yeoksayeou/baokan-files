I fully agree with the report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget, the explanation of the draft model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The past reactionary governments did nothing to build and ran deficits every year. The financial deficits kept increasing. Besides relying on so-called "American aid" and borrowing foreign debts to make ends meet, they were too poor to do anything. After liberation, everything was revitalized, and construction undertakings advanced by leaps and bounds. The country's financial economy has become increasingly strong and very solid. These facts are commonly seen and rejoiced by the people of the whole country. After listening to Vice Premier Li's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," I felt infinite excitement and emotion. Last year, our country's construction was more and larger in scale than in previous years. Not only was the country's economy not strained due to the many construction tasks, but there was also a surplus of more than 1.01 billion yuan at the end of the year. The more things are done, the more money is not used up. The transformation of a poor country into a very wealthy country in just a few years is truly a financial miracle for the country and is worthy of celebration.

Now I would like to introduce some information about the rice stem borer control work in Jiangxi, which is closely related to the increase in national grain production, and may be helpful for your reference.

Before liberation, Jiangxi often suffered from rice stem borer disasters. Sometimes the total loss of rice in the province due to rice stem borer damage could reach 20% to 30% or more. Even in normal years, the loss was about 10%. There were very few years without rice stem borer damage. In individual places, it could be so severe that the entire suburbs were covered with white ears and there was no harvest. When Jiangxi was just liberated in 1949, the provincial party and government leaders saw this phenomenon with their own eyes and were very concerned. They launched a province-wide mass insect extermination campaign in the winter of 1950, and after six years, the rice stem borer disaster has been basically overcome. The situation of white ears all over the suburbs like before is no longer seen. In recent years, the broad masses have accumulated some new experiences in the practice of rice stem borer control, which can be helpful to grain production. Please allow me to talk about it briefly:

I. "Three Plowings" to Control Rice Stem Borer – Since 1950, the method used in Jiangxi to control rice stem borer has been a "three plowings" method. What are the three plowings? That is, active autumn plowing, universal winter plowing, and early spring plowing. How can this method control rice stem borers? Because the residual rice roots left in the fields after the rice harvest, as well as various weeds in the fields, are the nests of various pests and rice stem borers. Using plowing and harrowing methods to bury them deep in the soil can kill them. Before liberation, about two-thirds of the paddy fields in Jiangxi Province were not used for replanting after the autumn harvest, but were left barren and idle, protecting rice stem borers and other pests to survive the winter. The problem lies here. This is the main reason why there were rice stem borer disasters every year before. In response to this problem, plowing and harrowing methods are used to fundamentally eliminate them. It is best to plow all the idle fields in the autumn. Otherwise, they should be universally plowed in the winter. If they cannot be plowed in the winter, they must be plowed early in the following year before the rice stem borers turn into moths and fly out, so that the rice stem borers and other pests can be killed. Over the past six years, the masses have proved that in places where the "three plowings" work is done thoroughly, not only will there be no rice stem borer disasters, but other pests can also be reduced accordingly. If the "three plowings" work can be combined with deep plowing, it will have a greater insecticidal effect. However, the farmers' habit of planting red clover is to plant without plowing, and the rice stem borers etc. in it are not easy to eliminate. Other methods must be found to remedy this shortcoming.

II. Plow Immediately After Harvesting – From the production experience of Jiangxi farmers, the following conclusion has been drawn: that is, no matter whether it is early, middle, or late rice fields, if time can be seized to plow and harrow immediately after harvesting, it is most effective in killing insects. The most important thing to pay attention to is when harvesting early rice and middle rice, the pests in the early and middle rice fields can be killed in the original paddy fields, so as to avoid migrating to other paddy fields to harm them. When harvesting early rice, it is best to achieve "harvesting early rice in the morning, transplanting late rice in the afternoon," and "yellow in the morning, green in the afternoon." This is the most important technique for killing insects. Because if the original paddy fields are not plowed and harrowed immediately after the early rice is harvested, the various pests in the original paddy fields will lose their hiding places and have no food to eat, so they will fly around, jump around, and migrate to nearby late rice seedlings or other crops to survive, and the late rice or other crops will suffer. If you can plow and harrow immediately after harvesting, you can immediately plow and bury various pests deep into the soil and take their lives. If you want to have fewer pests on the late rice, you must pay attention to this measure. Even fields that do not grow second-season late rice cannot be left uncultivated and abandoned, which is most harmful. It should be plowed and harrowed quickly and planted with autumn dry crops. This method should not only be done in paddy fields, but also in other crop fields. After the harvest, the fields should be quickly turned over, which is very beneficial.

III. Early Sowing and Early Transplanting – In recent years, the masses of farmers in Jiangxi have created a very good production technique, that is, both early and late-season rice should strive for early sowing and early transplanting. Using this method can not only play a role in increasing production, but also reduce rice stem borer and other insect pests. Late sowing and late transplanting are not suitable, often reducing production and suffering from rice stem borer damage. Early rice should use early-maturing and high-yielding varieties such as Nanthe No. 1, implement early planting, and can be harvested early. Early rice is harvested early, and late rice can also be transplanted early. Early transplanting of late rice can naturally be harvested early and avoid the local autumn drought and the harm of the fourth generation of rice stem borers, so as to obtain a bumper harvest without rice stem borer damage. This method is being promoted in various parts of Jiangxi.

IV. Promote "Three Changes" – In recent years, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has vigorously promoted the "three changes" rice planting system, which has been successful. What are the "three changes"? That is, "turning dry land into paddy fields," "changing single-season rice into double-season rice," and "changing middle-season rice into early-season rice." Facts have proved that this system is very good and has been promoted throughout the province. It can increase the utilization rate of land, expand the multiple cropping index of arable land, and play a great role in increasing production. At the same time, because the multiple cropping index is expanded, the idle fields in autumn and winter can be reduced. In the past, this kind of idle land only grew rice once in the summer, and most of it was uncultivated in autumn and winter, allowing it to grow full of weeds and protect various pests to survive the winter, so rice stem borers were not easy to control. Now, the "three changes" are being promoted to increase the multiple cropping in autumn and winter, plowing it, and the pests are also killed. The promotion of "three changes" can also gradually reduce the area of mixed planting areas, interplanting areas, and single-season middle-season rice areas. These three types of rice areas make it easiest for rice stem borers to get continuous food, creating the most favorable conditions for the occurrence of rice stem borers and other pests, which is very undesirable. Promoting the "three changes" can make these pests unable to get food for a period of time and eliminate themselves.

V. Eliminate Weeds – Weeds are like bullies. If there are bullies in society, people cannot live in peace. If there are weeds in the fields, crops cannot fight against them and cannot grow. The principle is the same. It not only robs the soil of fertilizer, hinders the growth of crops, but also hides various pests and plant pathogens, causing various diseases and insect pests. In particular, the weeds on the ridges of the fields hide more pests. It has been found that there are more than 500 kinds. When there is nothing to eat in the fields, they hide on the ridges to survive; when crops are planted in the fields, they run down from the ridges to the fields to cause harm. Therefore, the weeds in the fields, on the ridges, and near the fields must be shoveled clean, which can eliminate pests and diseases and accumulate a lot of fertilizer, which is a double benefit. Jiangxi farmers are now paying attention to this work, especially in various counties in southern Jiangxi, which are doing a better job. In some places, the ridges can be shoveled on three sides. Among the weeds, barnyard grass is the most harmful and must be paid attention to. If barnyard grass can be eliminated, the national rice production can be increased even more.

VI. Use Pesticides for Control – Now our country can manufacture its own insecticides, which greatly facilitates the prevention and control of pests. Jiangxi, like other provinces, is also preparing to use pesticides such as 666 for key prevention and control, mainly for second-season late rice, which can certainly solve the problem. However, the quantity of pesticides is not enough for universal application. In places where there is no pesticide supply, the above-mentioned methods are still used to prevent and control pests.

VII. Protect Frogs – Frogs are extremely beneficial to farming and can eat a lot of pests. If there are no frogs in the fields, the number of pests would be unimaginable. In Jiangxi and other provinces, people often catch and eat frogs in large quantities, which is very unreasonable. The masses should be advised to pay attention to protecting frogs.

In general, there are extremely effective methods for preventing and controlling rice stem borer and other insect pests, and there are many methods. It is impossible to describe them all in a few words. The above are just a few of the most critical methods. If they can be applied flexibly according to local conditions and time conditions, not only can rice stem borer be prevented and controlled, but other pests can also be prevented and controlled to some extent. Farmers in various places have created many good methods in production practice. As long as they can kill rice stem borers and prevent other insect pests, any method can be used. Don't think that there is no way to control insects. There are many methods, but various places have not summarized them well and have not promoted and applied them well. Of course, the prevention and control methods currently used cannot be said to be perfect, but they can still solve the problem at present. After further investigation and research, and summarizing the experience of the masses, the technology can naturally be gradually improved. Article 18 of the National Agricultural Development Program has pointed out: Starting from 1956, within 7 or 12 years, in all possible places, the 10 major diseases and insect pests in the country will be basically eliminated. I think this is entirely possible. Rice stem borer is the most harmful insect pest among the 10 major diseases and insect pests, and it must be eliminated quickly. We must have confidence, determination, and work together to eliminate rice stem borer across the country.

Title: Guizhou's Ethnic Work Situation - Speech by Delegate Yang Hanxian

I believe that the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Minister Liao Luyan are completely in line with reality. I completely agree with and support them. Now I would like to express some opinions on the ethnic work in Guizhou Province.

In the past year, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the serious implementation of ethnic policies by party and government leaders at all levels, the construction undertakings of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province have made great progress. By the spring of this year, the agricultural cooperativization movement in the minority areas of the province had achieved the primary form of cooperativization together with the Han areas, and a number of advanced cooperatives had also been established. In counties with a large number of ethnic minorities, the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives has reached more than 80%. In the cooperativization movement, attention was paid to taking care of ethnic characteristics, and the production enthusiasm of ethnic minorities was very high. The winter plowing and fertilizer accumulation last year and the sowing work this spring have mostly completed the plan. For example, in Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, the sowing work this year was about half a month earlier than last year. The average sowing area and fertilization amount in Longjie District of the county increased by about 50% compared with last year, and the number of people working in some cooperatives reached 98%. According to statistics from more than a dozen counties inhabited by ethnic minorities, such as Ceheng, Wangmo, Guanling, and Huangping, more than 80% of the fields and soil that were not very accustomed to plowing in winter in 1954 were plowed last winter. The agricultural cooperativization movement has achieved great success in the minority areas of our province.

However, there are also some shortcomings and problems in agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production. This is mainly because we do not have enough investigation and understanding of the social conditions of ethnic minorities, and the propaganda of ethnic policies is not deep enough. Therefore, some areas cannot carry out work practically on the existing basis, and some problems have occurred. For example, in the cooperativization movement, some areas did not take adequate care of the "hemp gardens" that should be given appropriate care due to the historical legacy of ethnic minorities, which caused ideological concerns among some ethnic minorities in some areas, and even affected their enthusiasm for production. Because the "hemp garden" is the source of raw materials for the clothes of ethnic minorities, they have spent many years, even ten years, to build a "hemp garden". In the cooperativization movement, when the self-retained land left to ethnic minorities was allocated, the "hemp garden" was allocated less or not at all. If the ethnic minorities have less "hemp garden", the clothes will become a problem. For example, in some remote ethnic minority areas, because the establishment of cooperatives was too fast, no sufficient preparations were made in advance, and there was a lack of specific leadership afterwards, which once caused the sideline production to stop for a short period of time, affecting the income of farmers. For example, in Fadi and Longjie districts of Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, some farmers who were originally food-deficient households in April this year have already obtained grain purchase certificates, but because the sideline production stopped after cooperativization, they had no money on hand and felt that life was difficult for a while. According to reports, the number of students in Tianqiao Elementary School, Shimen Elementary School, Shimen Middle School, etc. has decreased by about one-fifth to one-quarter compared with the second half of last year. This is all due to one-sidedly emphasizing collectivization, only paying attention to agricultural production, and neglecting sideline production, which has resulted in a decrease in the income of cooperative members. In addition, there are also some impractical practices in the promotion of new agricultural tools. For example, seven-inch plows and double-wheeled double-share plows are not very suitable for some areas in Guizhou. Some areas only blindly pursue promotion numbers, regardless of whether they are applicable. As a result, many agricultural tools are left idle and "hanging". Gaochao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guizhu County now has several double-wheeled double-share plows and two seven-inch plows hanging. It is hoped that relevant business departments will investigate and study and supply agricultural tools suitable for mountainous areas. Some of the above-mentioned shortcomings are more or less unavoidable in the work, but some are due to carelessness and lack of foresight. Although these shortcomings have been overcome or are being gradually overcome, we must still pay attention to them in the future, especially in backward minority areas.

In terms of cultivating ethnic minority cadres, in recent years, adhering to the policy of vigorously cultivating ethnic minority cadres, about 10,000 full-time cadres have been cultivated through various tasks. Many of these cadres hold important positions in leadership positions at all levels. Regarding the issue of improving the quality of ethnic minority cadres, attention has been paid to strengthening assistance to ethnic minority cadres in their work and adopting rotational training methods to continuously improve the political, cultural, and professional level of ethnic minority cadres. At present, the work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres is developing unevenly. In the future, attention should be paid to cultivating ethnic minority women cadres and strengthening the training of ethnic minority scientific and technological cadres. Only in this way can we adapt to the needs of various tasks.

We must work together with the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou to do our work better, strive to overcome the shortcomings and problems in our work, vigorously promote ethnic policies, study and promote the charters of advanced cooperatives, and strive to thoroughly realize the national budget for 1956.

    我们一定能消灭螟灾
    ——杨惟义代表的发言
    关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，我表示完全同意。
    过去的反动政府，不做什么建设的事而年年闹亏空，财政上的赤字，不断增高，除了依靠所谓“美援”，借外债度日外，就穷得没有办法。解放以后，百废俱兴，建设事业，突飞猛进，国家的财政经济，又能日益雄厚而非常巩固。这些事实，全国人民所共睹而感到最欣慰的。听了李副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”以后，使我有无限的兴奋和感想。去年我国的建设，比前几年更多而规模又更大，不但是不会因为建设的任务多而国家的经济上会感到不够，并且在年终结算时，还盈余了101，000多万元，事体越做得多而经费越用不完，把以前的一个穷国家，在短短的几年中，就变为现在很富足的国家，这真是国家财政上的奇迹，值得庆贺。
    现在我想向各位介绍一些关于江西方面治螟工作的情况，这与国家的粮食增产很有关系，或许可供大家参考。
    解放以前，江西常有螟灾，有时全省稻谷所受到螟害的总损失可达百分之二、三十以上，即是平常年岁，亦有10％左右的损失，没有螟害的年成，那是绝少的。个别地方会严重到全郊都是白穗，颗粒无收。1949年刚解放时，本省党政领导，曾亲眼看到这种现象，非常关心，就在1950年冬季起，掀起了全省性的群众灭虫运动，直到现在，经过6年，基本上已经是克服了螟灾。以前那样满郊都是白穗的景况，现在是不复见了。近几年来，由于广大群众，在治螟的实践中，积累了一些新的经验，对于粮食生产，可以有些帮助，请让我稍为谈谈：
    一、“三耕”治螟——自1950年以来，江西治螟所用的方法是一种三耕治螟法。什么是三耕？即是积极秋耕，普遍冬耕和提早春耕。用这种方法何以能治螟虫？因为稻谷收割后，所遗留在田里的残余稻根以及田里的各种杂草，就是各种害虫和螟虫的巢穴，应用耕耙的方法，把它们耕埋到深土里，就可以杀死它们。在解放以前，自秋收以后，江西全省约有三分之二的稻田，都是不利用来再种植，让它荒芜休闲，保护螟虫和其他各种害虫过冬。问题就出在这里，以前螟灾之所以年年有，这是最主要的原因。针对这个毛病，所以应用耕耙的方法，来作根本的消灭。能在秋季把休闲田耕完最好，否则应在冬季去普遍耕完，冬季不能耕完，必须在次年于螟虫未化蛾飞出以前，就要提早去耕，才可杀死螟虫和其他害虫。经过这6年来，由群众证明，凡是三耕工作做得很彻底的地方，不但不会有什么螟灾，其他害虫，亦可相应减少。三耕工作，如能结合深耕，更有杀虫的功效。只是农民种植红花草的习惯，是不耕而种的，这里面的螟虫等，还不易消灭，必须另找其他办法，来补救这个缺点。
    二、随割随耕——从江西农民的生产经验中，得出这样的总结：即是不论早、中、晚稻田，收割了以后，如能争取时间，随即耕耙，是最能杀虫的。早稻和中稻收割时，最要注意这一点，可把早、中稻田中的害虫，杀死在原来的稻田中，而免迁移到其他稻田里去为害。早稻收割时，最好要做到“上午割早稻，下午插晚稻”，“上午黄，下午青”。
     这是杀虫最扼要的技术。因为早稻收割了以后，若是不立即去耕耙，原有稻田中的各种害虫，失了隐蔽物而又没有食料可吃，就会四处纷飞，各方蹦跳，迁徙到附近晚稻苗上，或其他作物上去求生，晚稻或其他作物，就要遭殃。如能随割随耕，便可把各种害虫，立即耕埋到深土中去，收拾它们的老命。要想晚稻上的害虫少，这一个措施，是不可不注意的。即是不种二季晚稻的田，也不能不耕，让它荒弃，这是最有害的。应当赶快耕耙，种植秋季的旱作。这个办法，不只是水稻田应当如此去做，其他庄稼田地，收割了以后，都应当抢快去把田地耕翻起来，这是很有益处的。
    三、早播早插——近年来，江西农民群众，创造了一个很好的生产技术，即是早晚两季水稻，都要争取早播早插。应用这个方法，不但能起到增产作用，同时亦可减少螟害和其他虫灾。迟播迟插都不相宜，常会减产而受螟害。早稻采用早熟丰产的品种如南特号，实行早栽，就可早收。早稻早收，晚稻亦可以早插。晚稻早插，自然可以早收而能避免当地的秋旱和第四代的三化螟为害，因此就可以得到丰收而没有螟害。这种办法，江西各地正在推行。
    四、推行“三变”——近年来，江西省委大力推行“三变”的种稻制度，已经成功。什么是“三变”？即是要把“旱地变水田”，“单季稻变为双季稻”和“中稻变早稻”。事实证明，这种制度是很好的，已经推行全省，可以增加土地的利用率，可以扩大耕地的复种指数而能起到很大的增产作用。同时，因为扩大了复种的指数，即可减少秋冬季的休闲田。这种休闲田，以前每年仅在夏季种一次水稻，而秋冬两季多是不耕的，让它长满杂草，保护各种害虫过冬，所以螟虫就不易除治。现在推行“三变”，增加秋冬季的复种，把它耕掉，害虫亦被杀灭。推行“三变”，又可以逐渐减少混栽区、间栽区和一季中稻区的面积。这三种稻区，最易使螟虫得到不断的食物，给螟虫和其他害虫的发生，造成最有利的条件，顶要不得。推行“三变”，可使这些害虫有一段时间得不到食物而自行消灭。
    五、消灭杂草——杂草等于恶霸，社会中有恶霸，人民不得安生，田里有杂草，庄稼斗争不过它，就生长不起来，道理是一样的。它不仅是能夺取田土里的肥料，妨碍作物的生长，并且还能隐藏各种害虫和植物病菌，招致各种病虫灾害。尤其是田埂上的杂草，所隐藏的害虫更多，已经查出了有五百多种。田里没有东西可吃时，它们就藏在田埂上度日；田里种了庄稼，它们就由田埂上跑下田去为害。所以田地中和田埂上以及田地附近的杂草，都必须把它铲得精光，既可以消灭病虫害，又可以大量积肥，真是一举两得。这项工作，江西农民现在是很注意了，尤其是赣南各县，比较做得更好，有的地方，能把田埂铲得三面光。杂草中尤以稗草为害最大，必须注意。如能消灭稗草，全国稻谷自可得到更多的增产。
    六、用药除治——现在我国自己能制造杀虫药，对于害虫的防治工作有了莫大的便利。江西方面和其他各省一样，亦预备应用六六六等药来作重点的防治，主要是用在二季晚稻上，当然是可以解决问题的。但是药剂的数量还不够普遍应用，没有药剂供应的地方，仍是应用上面所说的各项方法，来防治害虫。
    七、保护蛙类——蛙类对于农事极其有益，能吃不少的害虫。田间如无蛙类，害虫不知要多到如何程度。江西境内和其他各省一样，常有人大量捕食青蛙，这是很不合理的。应当劝告群众，注意保护蛙类。
    总的来说，防治螟灾和其他虫害，都是极有办法的，并且方法很多，千头万绪，也不是三言两语所能说完的。上面所述，只是几项最有关键性的方法，如能因地制宜，因时制宜，而灵活运用，不但可以防治螟灾，其他害虫亦多少可以防治。各地农民在生产实践中，已经创造出不少的好方法，只要能杀灭螟虫，能防止其他虫害，任何方法，都可应用。不要以为治虫没有办法，而是方法很多，各地没有很好地去总结，没有很好地去推广应用。当然，现在所用的防治方法，不能说是已经尽善尽美，但在目前，尚可解决问题，以后再加调查研究，再去总结群众的经验，自然可以逐步提高技术。全国农业发展纲要中的第十八条已经指出：从1956年开始，分别在7年或12年内，在一切可能地方，基本上消灭全国10大病虫灾害。我认为这是完全可以做到的。螟灾是10大病虫灾害中为害最大的虫灾，必须赶快去消灭它。我们要有信心，要有决心，要为消灭全国螟灾而共同努力。贵州省民族工作情况——杨　汉　先　代　表　的　发　言
    李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和廖鲁言部长的报告，我认为完全符合实际，我完全同意和拥护。现在我就贵州省民族工作方面的情况，发表一点意见。
    一年来，由于中央和毛主席的正确领导，各级党政领导认真的贯彻执行了民族政策，贵州省各族人民的建设事业，得到了很大的进展。农业合作化运动截至今年春季全省的少数民族地区已和汉族地区一道实现了初级形式的合作化，并且还办了一批高级社。少数民族较多的县分入社农户也都达到了80％以上。合作化运动中，注意照顾了民族特点，少数民族人民的生产情绪很高，去年的冬耕积肥和今春的播种工作，大都已完成了计划。例如威宁彝族、回族、苗族自治县今年的播种工作比去年提早约半月左右，该县龙街区的播种面积和施肥量平均比去年增加50％左右，有的社出工人数达到了98％。据少数民族聚居的册亨、望谟、关岭、黄平等十来个县的统计，1954年还不很习惯翻犁冬田冬土的地区，在去年冬天翻犁的田土就有80％以上。合作化运动在我省少数民族地区，已获得很大的成绩。
    但是，在农业合作化和农业生产中也存在着一些缺点和问题。这主要是由于我们对少数民族社会情况调查了解不够，宣传民族政策也不够深入，因此，有的地区不能很好的在现有基础上切合实际的开展工作，发生了一些问题，例如在合作化运动中，有的地区对少数民族历史上遗留下的应当适当照顾的“麻园”照顾得不够，以致在某些地区引起了部分少数民族的思想顾虑，甚至影响到他们的生产积极性。因为“麻园”是少数民族衣服原料的来源地，他们经过多少年，甚至十年才搞好一个“麻园”。合作化运动中，在留给少数民族的自留地时，“麻园”留少了或者是没有留，少数民族的“麻园”少了，衣服就成了问题。又如有的边远少数民族地区因为建社较快，事前没有作好充分准备，事后缺乏具体领导，曾经在一个短时期内使副业生产停顿，影响了农民的收入。例如威宁彝族、回族、苗族自治县的法地、龙街几个区，今年四月间有少数农民原系缺粮户，他们已经得到购粮证，但由于合作化后副业生产停顿，手边没钱，一时感到生活困难。据了解，该地天桥小学、石门小学、石门中学等的学生数均比去年下半年减少了约五分之一至四分之一。这都是由于片面强调集体化，只注意农业生产，忽视副业生产，使社员收入减少所造成的结果。此外，在推广新式农具中也有一些不切合实际的作法，如七寸步犁、双轮双铧犁在贵州的某些地区都不很合用，有的地区只盲目追求推广数字，不顾是否适用，结果许多农具被放着和“挂”着，贵筑县高潮农业生产合作社，现在就挂有几部双轮双铧犁和两部七寸步犁。希望有关业务部门调查研究，供给适用山区的农具。上述这些缺点，有的是工作中或多或少难于避免的，但也有的是由于粗枝大叶缺乏预见性所产生的。这些缺点虽然已经克服或者正在逐步克服，可是今后仍然必须注意，特别是在落后的少数民族地区更要注意。
    培养民族干部方面，几年来本着大力培养民族干部的方针，通过各项工作，已经培养出一万名左右的脱产干部。这些干部有不少在各级领导岗位上担任着重要职务。关于提高民族干部的质量问题，注意了在工作中加强对少数民族干部的帮助和采取轮训的办法，使少数民族干部的政治、文化和业务水平得到不断的提高。目前培养民族干部的工作，发展得尚不平衡，今后应注意少数民族妇女干部的培养，加强培养少数民族的科学技术干部。这样才能适应各项工作的需要。
    我们一定要和贵州各族人民一道更好的把我们的工作作好，努力克服我们工作中的缺点和问题，大力宣传民族政策，学习和宣传高级社社章，为彻底实现1956年的国家预算而努力。
