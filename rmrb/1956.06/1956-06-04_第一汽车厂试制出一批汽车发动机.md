Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd. A batch of engines for automobiles have been successfully trial-produced at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Yesterday morning, one engine was run on the test stand for fifty-five minutes.

An engineer from the engine workshop told Xinhua reporters that the oil pressure, air compressor pressure, and noise during operation of this batch of engines were all normal.

The engine for the "Liberation" brand truck manufactured by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is a four-stroke carburetor gasoline engine with six cylinders and 95 horsepower. When the "Liberation" truck is equipped with it, it can travel 60 kilometers per hour. In the design and trial production of this internal combustion engine, engines of different tonnage trucks from various countries were referenced, and their advantages were incorporated.

The structure of an automobile engine is very complex. Producing an engine requires more than 1,400 mechanical processing procedures, and the precision requirements for parts processing are very high.

    第一汽车厂试制出一批汽车发动机
    新华社长春3日电　一批汽车上用的发动机在第一汽车制造厂试制出来。昨天上午有一个发动机被放在试验台上运转了五十五分钟。
    发动机车间工程师告诉新华社记者说：这批发动机的机油压力，空气压缩机压力和运转时的嗓音，都很正常。
    第一汽车制造厂制造的“解放”牌载重汽车的发动机，是四冲程化油器式的汽油发动机，共有六个汽缸，九十五匹马力，以后“解放”牌汽车装上它，每小时可以走六十公里。这种内燃发动机，在设计和试制中，参考了各个国家不同吨位载重汽车的发动机，吸取了它们的优点。
    汽车发动机的构造是很复杂的。生产一部发动机要经过一千四百多道机械加工的工序，零件加工精度要求很高。
