Representative An Wenqin's speech:

    After respectfully listening to Vice Premier Li's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao's explanation of the draft model charter for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng's report on the work of the Standing Committee, I feel that the language is precise and the meaning is righteous, open and aboveboard, well-organized, and everything is perfect. After repeated consideration, there is no flaw to point out. In short, if one can truly understand the topic, one will naturally produce a good article. Anyone with blood and spirit will regard it as golden rules and jade laws, and will never forget it. Therefore, we resolutely and unanimously support it to the end. In the old China era, some people ridiculed us, saying: "Chinese people say but do not do, this is the great shame of the Chinese people." The so-called "one must insult oneself before others will insult one" is true. Every time I think about the establishment of the Central People's Government, whether it is the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the Wuhan Iron Bridge, the harnessing of the Huai River, the harnessing of the Yellow River, various industries, and various factories and mines, all have exceeded quotas and been completed ahead of schedule. Not only do we give full play to our enthusiasm and creativity on the production front, but we must also strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan as soon as possible. Now, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the shame of Chinese people only talking and not doing has been completely washed away. However, I hope that all government officials at all levels must be open-minded to accept advice, listen to both sides to gain insight, listen to one side and be in the dark, do not conceal their own faults, conduct self-examination, and correct themselves. They should uphold diligence, prudence, integrity, and strive to the end. If this is the case, using it to govern the country, the country will be well governed; using it to pacify the people, the people will be at peace. From then on, with the country well governed and the people at peace, how could it not become one of the rich and powerful countries! Be vigilant, be careful, and encourage each other!

    安文钦代表的发言
    关于李副总理一九五五年国家决算和一九五六年国家预算的报告，廖部长高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明，彭副委员长常委会的工作报告，敬聆之下，第觉辞严义正，磊落光明，井井有条，事事尽善，再四思维，无瑕可指。总之，能把题目认得真，自然做出好文章，凡有血气者，奉之如金规玉律，书绅不忘，所以坚决的一致的拥护到底。在旧中国时代，有人讽刺我们说：中国人说了不做，这是中国人的大耻辱。所谓夫人必自侮而后人侮之者是也。每念中央人民政府成立以来，举凡宝成铁路、兰新铁路、武汉铁桥、治淮、治黄，各种工业，各种厂矿，莫不突破定额，提前完成。不但在生产战线上发挥积极性和创造性，尤要为早日完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。今蒙毛主席英明领导下，把中国人只说不做的耻辱洗刷的干干净净。虽然，更希望各级政府诸公，须要虚怀纳谏，兼听则明，偏听则暗，莫讳己过，自我检讨，自行匡正，当守勤慎廉明，奋斗到底。诚如是，以之治国，国无不治，以之安民，民无不安，从此国治民安，其不至于富强大国之一者几希！凛之，慎之，其各勉旃！
