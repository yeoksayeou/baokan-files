Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 14th: On June 13th, the last soldier of the British army, which had occupied Egypt for seventy-four years, shouldered his rifle and silently left the Suez Canal Zone. The Egyptian people have achieved the goal of their long and heroic struggle: to drive all foreign occupiers from the land of their ancestors.

    All Egyptian newspapers carried the news of the complete withdrawal of British troops on the front page in large headlines on this day. The "Republic" newspaper said in an editorial that the British occupation had ended. British troops have permanently left Egypt. The newspaper called on the Egyptian people to remain vigilant against the conspiracies of the imperialists and to defend their freedom and independence.

    Britain occupied Egypt in 1882. As a result of the long-term struggle of the Egyptian people, Britain was forced to sign an agreement with Egypt on October 19, 1954, regarding the Suez Canal Zone, according to which British troops in the Suez Canal Zone would be completely withdrawn within twenty months. June 18 this year is the deadline for the British withdrawal.

    According to the agreement, after the withdrawal of British troops, the main equipment of the Suez Canal Zone military base will still be maintained and managed by British "civilian contracting companies." Once Egypt and the eight countries currently participating in the Arab League and Turkey are subjected to "armed attack," Egypt must also provide Britain with "the necessary facilities to place this base on a war footing and use it effectively."

    On June 12th, in the fading sunset, the last batch of British troops lowered the last British flag on their barracks. There were no usual drums or bugles to greet its descent. That night, John Lassie, commander of the British garrison in Port Said, signed the documents to hand over the naval headquarters to Egyptian officials. Before dawn the next day, the last batch of British sentries left Egyptian soil. Lassie then boarded a British tank landing craft. He stood listlessly on the deck and said, "This is an unpleasant thing for us."

    About half an hour later, the Egyptian flag was raised on the roof of the former British naval headquarters, amid cheers from the Egyptians gathered nearby.

    埃及人民实现了长期斗争的目标
    最后一批英国殖民军已撤出埃及
    新华社14日讯　开罗消息：六月十三日，占领了埃及七十四年的英国军队的最后一个士兵，背起他的步枪，默默地离开了苏彝士运河区。埃及人民实现了他们长期英勇斗争的目标：把外国占领者从他们祖国的土地上全部赶出去了。
    埃及所有报纸在这一天都在首页以大字标题登载了英国军队撤退完毕的消息。“共和国报”在社论中说，英国占领终结了。英国军队永久离开了埃及。这家报纸号召埃及人民继续警惕帝国主义者的阴谋，并且保卫自己的自由和独立。
    1882年英国占领了埃及。由于埃及人民长期斗争的结果，英国在1954年10月19日被迫同埃及签订了关于苏彝士运河区的协定，根据这个协定，英国在苏彝士运河区的军队要在二十个月内完全撤出。今年六月十八日是英军撤退的最后期限。
    根据协定，在英军撤出后，苏彝士运河区军事基地的主要设备还要交由英国的“民间承包公司”保养和管理。一旦埃及等目前参加阿拉伯联盟的八个国家和土耳其受到“武装攻击”时，埃及还要提供给英国“必要的便利以便把这个基地置于战争基础之上并且有效地使用它”。
    六月十二日，在夕阳残照之下，最后的一批英国军队降下了他们兵营上的最后一面英国旗。没有往常的鼓声和号声来迎接它的下降。当天晚上，塞得港英国驻军司令约翰·拉西签署了文件，把海军司令部交还给埃及官员。第二天黎明以前，英军的最后一批岗哨离开了埃及土地。拉西接着也登上英国坦克登陆艇。他无精打采地站在甲板上说：“这对于我们是一件不愉快的事”。
    大约半小时以后，在原来的英国海军司令部的屋顶上，在聚集在附近的埃及人的欢呼声中，升起了埃及国旗。
