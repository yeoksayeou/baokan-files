    A Summary of Advanced Soviet Technology
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    What is the state of Soviet industrial and technological progress? Usually, we only catch glimpses of a few machines or visit a few factories, making it difficult to obtain a complete picture of the situation. But I always thought that one day, there would be an industrial exhibition like the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, allowing people to see the whole picture. That day has finally arrived. On June 4th, the All-Union Industrial Exhibition opened on the same site as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition. So many people have come from all over the Soviet Union and abroad to attend this grand event. The streets near the exhibition have suddenly become lively. Obviously, no one can see the entire All-Union Industrial Exhibition in one day, as it includes twenty exhibition halls, displaying nearly a thousand machines and lathes, approximately three thousand instruments, and about seven hundred models, all made in the Soviet Union. So, let's browse through the most exciting parts!

          “Atomic Energy” Hall
    The most attractive hall is the "Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy" hall. It is so crowded that you have to look through the gaps between people's shoulders to see anything. People who have never been to an atomic power station can find a simple representation of its principles in the third hall of this pavilion. In the center of the hall is an open, real reactor. Its most intense part is at the bottom of a six-meter-deep steel tank, which is filled with water. Invisible uranium rods emit "energy" inside the tank. Ordinary water is used as a moderator and reflector for the neutrons. At the same time, the water layer is a reliable shield against the reactor's radiation. The regulation of the nuclear chain reaction and the operation of the entire facility are automated. This small reactor only has a capacity of about 150 kilowatts, and the heat generated can be used to heat water. When the reactor is working, the bottom of the tank flickers with blue light, which is the partial conversion of uranium's radioactivity into visible light. What impressed me most here was that something that was considered incredibly mysterious not long ago is now being used as a "specimen" for popularizing scientific knowledge in the Soviet Union, providing viewing opportunities for tens of thousands of people every day. This "specimen" makes us even more confident when we see the huge model of the 200,000-kilowatt atomic power station next to it, confirming that this type of power station will be built during the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
    The science of nuclear energy is very young, but like reactors, the development of accelerators is very rapid. In the Atomic Energy Hall, we can clearly see this. Before us stands a model of the powerful synchrocyclotron owned by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which can achieve a proton energy of 680 million electron volts. There is also a photo of the largest synchrophasotron in the Soviet Union, which has achieved a proton energy of 10 billion electron volts.
      The “Atomic Energy” hall reflects the increasingly widespread use of atomic energy in the various sectors of the national economy in the Soviet Union, especially in the four main areas of industry, power plants, transportation, and medicine. Hundreds of Soviet doctors have learned to use radioactive isotopes to treat diseases. Approximately 1,500 packages of radioactive isotopes are sent to medical institutions throughout the Soviet Union every month. Foreign visitors should learn from the Soviet Union how to make atomic energy serve humanity more.

      “Machine Manufacturing” Hall
      The "Machine Manufacturing" Hall is the largest in the exhibition. For the past two years, people have visited this site to see the mechanization and electrification of agriculture. This year, they are visiting the technology and processes of many heavy industrial sectors. Fifteen independent sections are exhibited in twenty-six halls and five areas.

    In the ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy sections, the great leaps forward in the Soviet steel industry are immensely inspiring. Active models show many standard blast furnaces to be built during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Its effective volume is 1,513 cubic meters. It can produce one million tons of pig iron a year! Here, we learned about advanced methods such as continuous steel casting. A model of the equipment at the New Tula Steel Plant shows that rolled materials can be obtained directly from molten steel. There is no need to pour the molten steel into ingot molds or to roll the ingots on a primary rolling mill. By reducing the casting and heating operations, the production process is greatly shortened, and steel is saved. If this method can be used to cast 12 million to 15 million tons of steel by 1960, it can increase steel production by 1 million tons and save nearly 2 billion rubles.

    In the heavy machinery manufacturing section, the first thing that catches the eye is the runner of the water turbine used in the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. It is several people tall and weighs 426 tons. Naturally, it is impossible to move all the large heavy machines for the exhibition. Here, they are replaced by models. A "2500" hot-rolled steel plate machine, a "2800" cold-rolled aluminum alloy sheet machine, a machine tool for rolling balls with a diameter of 40 mm, a machine for spiral welding large-diameter steel pipes with narrow steel plates... these new machine models are dazzling.

    In the coal mining industry section, coal mining machines, tunnel boring machines, and many new machines are on display. Here are two mock headings, equipped with new coal mining machines and metal and reinforced concrete supports that move forward with the coal mining machines. The most eye-catching is the hydraulic coal mining machine. In fact, it consists of a water turbine and a pumping mechanism. Miners use it to cut the coal seam with a powerful stream of water, and then transport the coal and water together. Here is a machine from the "North Poleysayev" coal mine in Kuzbass, which uses hydraulic coal mining. The facts of this coal mine show that this hydraulic coal mining method increases labor productivity by four times, saves four-fifths of the wood, and reduces the cost of coal by half.

    In the tractor and agricultural machinery manufacturing section, many new machines illustrate the Soviet Union's efforts to further develop agriculture in recent years. Various types of tractors produced by the Chelyabinsk, Kharkov, Stalingrad, Minsk, Altai, and Vladimir factories are arranged in neat rows. From heavy-duty tractors with 140 horsepower for reclaiming wasteland to light and nimble tractors for gardens, tracked and wheeled, everything is available. There is a unique tractor, like a wheeled chassis, which can quickly be fitted with suspended agricultural implements such as plows, cultivators, seeders, beet and onion harvesters, transport flatcars, etc. The tractor operator does not need the help of a tow hand when driving it. The widespread use of suspended agricultural implements can free up tens of thousands of people from agricultural auxiliary work. As the Soviet Union attaches importance to corn crops, several machines for harvesting corn have emerged. Here is a new type of corn silage harvester, which can separately harvest corn ears and corn stalks while grinding them.

    In the special machine manufacturing technology section, we are treated to a feast of new things in casting, forging, heat treatment, welding, and metal cutting. There is a welding machine that can weld metal 400 mm thick. Here, we deeply feel the great power of cooperation between Soviet scientists, technicians, and workers. Many creations and inventions are the product of this cooperation.
        Other Exhibition Halls
      The "Machine Tool Manufacturing" Hall is on one side of the "Machine Manufacturing" Hall, and the "Geology, Petroleum, and Chemical" Hall is on the other. The "Machine Tool Manufacturing" Hall houses the latest machine tools of various types. Entering here is like entering a large workshop. Many machine tools demonstrate complex, meticulous, and agile operations. These machine tools all use electrical automatic devices and hydraulic keys.

      The maps hanging in the "Geology, Petroleum, and Chemical" Hall indicate the nearly three hundred most important mining areas in the Soviet Union. This is the result of diligent exploration. Here are exhibits of various methods of drilling to extract core samples and models of automated equipment for extracting core samples. The oil well derrick placed in the outdoor area can be pulled from one oil well to another in its entirety by a tractor. It saves oil well workers in Tatar nine-tenths of the time and labor. Here is a demonstration of the Soviet turbo drill, which has won the world's oil well drilling honor. Workers Kimazov and Beloglazov from the Tatar Autonomous Republic used it to drill more than 3,000 meters in a month on hard formations.

    Light industrial and food industrial products and processes are exhibited in many halls. In the four halls of "Silk," "Cotton," "Sugar," and "Brewing," the achievements of agriculture and handicrafts are displayed together. The most interesting are the operation of automated continuous production units that do not require human management, the production of artificial fiber textiles and artificial leather, and the acquisition of glass fiber, capron, and other substitutes. Here is also introduced a new method of extracting vegetable oil, which will enable the Soviet Union to extract 240,000 tons more oil with the same amount of oilseeds during the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

    Leaving the various exhibition halls, we arrived at the main hall within the gate of the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition. Here are displayed many pictorial materials, which enable us to understand the close relationship between Soviet science and the national economy. We saw: the research and exploitation of mineral resources, the establishment of a unified power system, the achievements in physics and ultra-high voltage technology, the theoretical and practical application of automation and remote control, the use of semiconductors, etc., all of which show the contributions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

    The All-Union Industrial Exhibition, like the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, is a permanent exhibition and will become a summary of advanced experience and a center for the promotion of advanced technology.

    苏联先进技术的总汇
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    苏联工业技术进步的情形怎么样？平常我们一鳞半爪地看见几种机器，参观几个工厂，很难求得这个问题的圆满解答。但是心里想，总有一天会出现像全苏农业展览会那样的工业展览会，让人看一个全貌。这一天终于到来了。六月四日，全苏工业展览会就在全苏农业展览会的地址内开幕了。多少人从苏联各地和国外赶来参加这个盛会呵。展览会附近的街道忽然热闹起来。显然，任何人一天不能看完规模这样宏大的全苏工业展览会；它包括二十个展览馆，陈列着近千种机器和车床，约三千种仪器和约七百种模型，全是苏联自制的。那么，让我们浏览当中最精彩的部分吧！
          “原子能”馆
    最吸引人的是“和平利用原子能”馆。这里拥挤处要透过人们的肩部空隙才能看到东西。没有到过原子能发电站的人们，在这个馆的第三厅找到了它的简单原理的反映。厅中央是打开的真的反应堆。它的最强烈部分在六公尺深的钢槽底，那里注满了水。看不见的铀杆在槽内发出“能”。用普通的水当做中子的减速物和反射物。同时，水层是反应堆辐射的可靠防御物。核子连锁反应的调节和整个设备的工作都是自动化的。这个小反应堆的能量只一百五十瓩左右，所发的热能可以热水。反应堆工作的时候，槽底闪灼着蓝色光线，这是铀的放射能部分地变为可见的光线。在这里，我最受感动的是，不久前还被认为神秘得不得了的东西，如今在苏联当做普及科学知识的“标本”了，每日供给成千成万的人们观看。这个“标本”使我们在看到它旁边摆的二十万瓩原子能发电站巨大模型的时候，更加确信这种发电站将会在第六个五年计划内建成。
    核子能的科学非常年轻，但是像反应堆一样，加速器的发展非常迅速。在原子能馆里，我们鲜明地看到这点。在我们面前摆着苏联科学院拥有的强大的同步回旋加速器的模型，这个加速器能取得质子能量六亿八千万电子伏特。这里也挂着苏联最大的同步稳相加速器的照片，这个加速器取得的质子能量已达到一百亿电子伏特。
      “原子能”馆反映了苏联日益广泛地利用原子能到国民经济各个部门，特别是工业、发电站、交通、医药四个主要方面。已经有几百个苏联医生学会使用放射性同位素来治病。每月寄给全苏各地医疗机关约一千五百包放射性同位素。外国参观者应该学习苏联让原子能多多为人类服务呵。
      “机器制造业”馆
      “机器制造业”馆是展览会中最大的。过去两年人们在这个馆址参观了农业机械化和电气化，今年人们在这里参观许多重工业部门的技术和工艺。十五个独立的部分在二十六个厅和五个场子展出。
    在黑色冶金和有色冶金部分，苏联钢铁工业的大踏步前进的景象给人巨大的鼓舞。活动的模型表示着在第六个五年计划时期要建立的许多标准的高炉。它的有效容积为1，513立方公尺。它一年能产一百万吨生铁！在这里，我们认识了如像连续浇钢等等先进方法。新土拉钢铁厂的设备模型说明，可以从钢汁直接取得轧料。不需要把钢汁浇到钢锭模中去，不需要在初轧机上轧钢锭。由于减少铸锭和加热的操作，大大缩短生产过程和节省钢材。如果到1960年能用这个方法浇钢一千二百万到一千五百万吨，那么可以增产钢材一百万吨，节约近二十亿卢布。
    在重型机器制造业部分，投入眼帘的首先是那古比雪夫水电站用的水轮机的转轮。它有几人高，426吨重。自然许多大块重型机器是可能都搬来展览的。在这里它们是以模型代替了。“二五○○”式热轧钢板机，“二八○○”式冷轧铝合金薄板机，轧制直径四十公厘滚珠的机床，用窄钢板螺旋焊接成大直径钢管机……这些新式机器的模型琳琅满目。
    在煤矿工业部分，表演着采煤机、巷道开凿机和许多新式机器。这里有两个假掌子，里面配备着新式采煤机和随着采煤机前进的金属和钢筋混凝土的支架。最引人注目的是水力冲煤机。实际上它是由水轮机和抽水机构成的。矿工使用它以猛烈的水流冲切煤层，然后连水带煤输送出去。这里摆着采用水力采煤的库兹巴斯“北波雷沙也夫”煤矿的机器。这个煤矿的事实说明，这种水力采煤法把劳动生产率提高四倍，节省五分之四木材，降低煤的成本一半。
    在拖拉机和农业机器制造业部分，许多新式机器说明苏联这几年来进一步发展农业的努力。车里雅宾斯克、哈尔科夫、斯大林格勒、明斯克、阿尔泰、弗拉季米尔各个工厂出产的各式拖拉机，排成整齐的队列。从开垦荒地用的一百四十匹马力的重型拖拉机到园圃用的轻巧的拖拉机，履带的、轮子的，应有尽有。有一种别致的拖拉机，像一台带轮子的车架，可以很快地装上吊挂式农具犁、中耕机、播种机、甜菜和大葱起拔机、运输平车等等。拖拉机手驾驶它时，不用牵引手的帮助。广泛地采用吊挂式农具，可以把几十万人从农业辅助工作中腾出来。随着苏联重视玉米作物，出现了几种收获玉米的机器。这里放的一种新式玉米青贮料收获机，它可以分别收割玉米棒和玉米茎同时磨碎它们。
    在专门的机器制造业的工艺部分，我们饱看了铸造、锻压、热处理、焊接和金属切削方面的新事物。有一种电焊机，用它能焊接四百公厘厚的金属。在这里，我们深深感觉到苏联科学技术人员和工人合作的巨大力量。许多创造和发明都是这种合作的产物。
        其它各展览馆
      “机器制造业”展览馆的一边是“机床制造业”展览馆，另一边是“地质、石油和化学”展览馆。“机床制造业”馆里放着各式最新机床。走进这里好像走进大车间。好些机床表演着复杂、细致、敏捷的操作。这些机床都是采用电气自动装置和水力键的。
      “地质、石油和化学”馆里挂的地图，标明苏联现有近三百个最重要的矿区。这是辛勤勘探的结果。这里展览着各种钻井取岩心方法和取岩心的自动化设备的模型。馆外场子上放的凿油井用的塔架，可以用拖拉机从一个油井整个地拉到另一个油井。它为鞑靼凿油井工人节省十分之九的时间和劳动。这里表演着取得了世界凿油井荣誉的苏联涡轮钻探机。鞑靼自治共和国工人基马佐夫和别洛格拉佐夫用它在坚硬地层上一个月凿进了三千多公尺。
    轻工业和食品工业的产品和工艺，在许多馆展览。在“丝”、“棉”、“糖”“酿酒”四个馆里，农业和手工业的成就陈列在一起。最有味道的是那些不用人管的自动化连续生产机组的操作，人造纤维纺织品和人造皮革的生产，玻璃纤维、卡玻隆等等代用品的取得。这里也介绍一种新的榨取植物油的方法，它将使苏联在第六个五年计划期间用同量油料多榨二十四万吨油。
    离开了各个展览馆，我们到了全苏农业展览会大门内的主馆。这里陈列着许多图片材料，它们使我们了解到苏联科学和国民经济的密切联系。我们看到了：矿产的研究和开采，统一电力系统的建立，物理学和超高压技术方面的成就，自动化和远距离操纵的理论和实际运用，半导体的使用等等，无处没有苏联科学院的功绩。
    全苏工业展览会，和全苏农业展览会一样，是常设的，将成为交流先进经验和推广先进技术的总汇。
