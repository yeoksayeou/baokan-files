    Xinhua News Agency, 31st, Bangkok dispatch: Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram recently expressed extreme dissatisfaction with an article in the "New York Times." The article said that the Thai government was corrupt, and that the general Thai people opposed the current government, believing that the United States was the real government of Thailand.

    Phibunsongkhram said in a statement to the press on May 26 that he had decided to lift the ban on Thai newspapers commenting on international politics starting in June, so that Thai newspapers could also have the freedom to criticize foreign politics, in order to allow Thai newspapers to have the opportunity to fight back against such slanderous reports.

    On the same day, Jia Jun Chong, Director of the Thai Public Relations Office, also told the press that the Thai government could not tolerate such absurd reports from the "New York Times."

    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd, Bangkok dispatch: The Thai Public Relations Office issued a statement on the radio on the evening of May 26, accusing the American "New York Times" of damaging the reputation of the Thai government.

    The statement said that a recent report published by the "New York Times" has seriously damaged Thailand's reputation, saying that the Thai people want to overthrow the current government and that the United States is the government of the Thai people, which is completely unfounded. The Thai Public Relations Office expressed great regret over the "New York Times"'s publication of such presumptuous reports, and at the same time believes that this may damage the good relations between Thailand and the United States.

    In addition, according to a report in the "Yongheng Daily" on May 29, Jia Jun Chong, Director of the Thai Public Relations Office, told the press on May 28 that the "New York Times"'s report will become a fuse to make the Thai people more resentful of the United States.

    “纽约时报”辱骂泰政府銮披汶等表示不能容忍
    据新华社31日讯　曼谷消息：泰国总理銮披汶最近对“纽约时报”的一篇文章表示极端不满。这篇文章说泰国政府贪污，还说一般泰国人民反对现政府，认为美国才是泰国的真正政府。
    銮披汶在五月二十六日向报界发表谈话说，他已经决定从六月起宣布取消泰国报纸评论国际政治的禁令，让泰国报纸也有批评外国政治的自由，以便使泰国报纸对这种诬蔑性报道有还击的机会。
    泰国公共关系处处长甲军冲也在同一天向报界发表谈话说，泰国政府对“纽约时报”这样荒谬的报道是不能容忍的。
    新华社2日讯　曼谷消息：泰国公共关系处五月二十六日晚上在广播电台发表了一篇声明，指责美国“纽约时报”损害泰国政府的声誉。
    这篇声明说，“纽约时报”最近发表的一项报道对泰国声誉有严重损害，其中说泰国人民想推翻现政府并且说美国才是泰国人民的政府，而这些是毫无事实根据的。泰国公共关系处对“纽约时报”发表这种放肆的报道表示非常遗憾，同时认为这有可能损害到泰美两国之间的良好关系。
    另外据“永恒报”五月二十九日报道，泰国公共关系处处长甲军冲在五月二十八日向报界发表谈话说，“纽约时报”的这种报道将成为促使泰国人民更加憎恶美国的导火线。
