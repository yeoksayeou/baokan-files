Seize the Time to Catch More Fish

From March to June every year is the peak fishing season along China's coast. Currently, the peak season for prawns and large and small yellow croakers is about to pass, but only 70% of the small yellow croaker catch plan has been completed, and only 26% of the large yellow croaker catch plan has been completed. The reasons for the poor completion of the plan, in addition to the longer cold period this spring, the later arrival of the fish season, and the more frequent strong winds at sea, which resulted in fewer trips to sea, are mainly due to the lack of organization and leadership, and the failure to do a good job in grasping and communicating fish conditions. There are also shortcomings in transportation and purchasing, such as untimely unloading and handling, and some purchasing units are only willing to purchase economic fish and are unwilling to purchase miscellaneous fish, which account for more than half of the output, or do not dare to purchase them boldly. These all affect the enthusiasm of the fishermen.

Now, the fishing season for other fish species has not passed, and some have just begun. Therefore, we should quickly strengthen leadership, organize reconnaissance ships to grasp fish conditions in a timely manner, and use existing telecommunications equipment to exchange information. Organize specialized fishing boats to go to sea in time for purchasing, so that fishing boats can concentrate their efforts on fishing. Commercial departments should attach importance to the purchase and sale of miscellaneous fish; for scattered producers, contract pre-purchase work should be strengthened, and purchase prices should be agreed upon in advance. Because the output of sea fish is relatively concentrated, during the period of high production, more salted and dried products should be processed to supply the vast rural areas and meet the needs of the off-season.

    抓紧时间多捕鱼
    每年三月至六月，是我国沿海捕鱼旺季。目前大对虾和大小黄鱼鱼汛期快要过去了，但是小黄鱼捕捞计划只完成70％，大黄鱼捕捞计划只完成26％。计划完成得不好的原因，除了因今春冷的时间较长，鱼汛来得较迟，海上大风较多，致使出海次数较少外，主要是由于缺乏组织领导，掌握鱼情和互通鱼情的工作没有做好。在运输和收购方面也有缺点，如卸货搬运不及时，有些收购单位只愿收购经济鱼，对产量占半数以上的杂鱼不愿收购，或不敢大胆收购。这些都影响捕捞者的积极性。
    现在，其他鱼种的鱼汛期还没有过去，有的刚刚开始，因此应当迅速加强领导，组织侦察船，及时掌握鱼情，利用现有的电讯设备互通情报。组织专门渔船及时下海收购，使捕捞渔船能集中力量捕捞。商业部门应重视杂鱼的收购和推销；对分散的生产者，应该加强合同预购工作，事先商定收购价格。因为海鱼产量较集中，在多产时期，应该多加工一些盐干品，以供应广大农村和满足淡季的需要。（刘乐川）
