Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 8th. Changchun's state-owned commercial enterprises are expanding their purchases and adding new varieties to meet the increased purchasing power resulting from wage reforms.

Since the second quarter, the city's state-owned department store has been actively purchasing goods, adding over 2,000 new varieties, mostly from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing. State-owned food and aquatic product companies have stored significant quantities of non-staple foods such as pork, beef, mutton, chicken, and shrimp. They have also purchased large quantities of delicacies such as Jinhua ham and Nanjing salted duck and are continuing to procure more. They are also trial-producing over 50 types of processed meat products such as sausages and refined meat. The state-owned monopoly enterprise company has increased orders of cigarette brands such as "Flying Horse," "Red Gold," and "Beauty," and eight or nine types of liquor not previously supplied, in its purchase contracts with relevant units.

Changchun's local industries, jointly-owned textile factories, and handicraft production cooperatives are also trial-producing new autumn fashions and new commodities, or processing various inexpensive and stylish leather shoes and clothing.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The China Food Company's national supply conference, which closed on the 6th, arranged the acquisition and supply plan for the third quarter based on the current production and sales situation of live pigs and other commodities.

According to reports from representatives from various regions at the meeting, except for a slight increase in live pig production in some areas in the first half of this year, most areas did not increase production, and some even reduced production. The planned targets were generally not met, and the shortfall was significant, so the acquisition plan was also not completed. The meeting attributed this situation to the fact that after agricultural cooperativization, many agricultural production cooperatives focused their efforts on agricultural production and neglected the development of sideline occupations such as pig raising. At the same time, due to changes in production relations, many new problems arose in farmers' private pig raising, which were not resolved in a timely manner, affecting the enthusiasm for pig raising. The meeting believed that it is necessary to actively find ways to change this situation from the production side and also do a good job in acquisition and regulation of supply.

According to instructions from the State Council, the meeting decided to carry out live pig pre-purchase and fixed purchase work in the second half of the year. Currently, the government has decided to allocate a considerable amount of feed and funds to help and guide agricultural production cooperatives and members to raise live pigs. The meeting believed that it is necessary to vigorously promote private pig raising by members, with agricultural production cooperatives providing assistance in all aspects, to fully utilize members' original pig raising equipment, technology, and family semi-labor, and appropriately meet members' demands for increased income. At the same time, it is also necessary to help agricultural production cooperatives raise pigs. Regarding live pig prices, it was decided to appropriately increase them nationwide in different regions to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for pig raising.

The meeting also studied the changes in purchasing power that may be caused by wage reform and specifically arranged the supply plan for the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin in the third quarter. The supply volume for these three cities in the third quarter will increase by 20% to 30% compared with the same period last year. In addition, it also allocated the task of live pig transfer between provinces and between provinces and cities, emphasizing that all localities should quickly replenish their stock reserves before the end of June, do a good job in supplying cities and industrial and mining areas, and prevent stockouts. In areas where pork supply is insufficient, the supply of mutton and poultry foods should be expanded, and more processed meat products should be promoted.

    努力满足工资增加后职工们的新要求
    中国食品公司安排第三季度收购供应计划
    新华社长春8日电　长春市国营商业为适应工资改革以后购买力提高的情况，正在扩大进货量，增添新品种。
    市国营百货公司第二季度以来已经开始积极进货，现在增加了二千多种新品种，其中大部分是从上海、天津、北京等地运来的。国营食品公司和水产公司储存了不少猪、牛、羊、鸡、虾等副食品，买来了大批金华火腿、南京板鸭等美味食品，现在还在继续采购，并且试制香肠、灌肠、精制肉等五十多种肉类复制品。国营专卖事业公司在同有关单位订的进货合同中，增加了“飞马”、“红金”、“美丽”等五种牌子的香烟和八、九种过去没有供应过的酒。
    长春市的地方工业、公私合营的纺织厂和手工业生产合作社，也正在试制新式的秋装和新商品，或加工各种价廉物美的时式皮鞋和服装。
    新华社8日讯　六日闭幕的中国食品公司全国供应会议，根据当前生猪等商品的产销情况，安排了第三季度的收购和供应计划。
    从各地代表在会议上汇报的情况来看，今年上半年除了部分地区生猪略有增产以外，大部分地区没有增产，有的还减产了。规划中所要求的数字一般都未达到，而且距离很远，因此收购计划也没有完成。会议认为这种情况是由于农业合作化以后，很多农业生产合作社集中力量忙于农业生产，忽视了发展养猪等副业而引起的。同时，因为生产关系的变化，社员私人养猪又发生了许多新的问题，没有及时得到解决，影响了养猪的积极性。会议认为必须积极从生产上想办法改变这种情况，同时做好收购和调剂供应工作。
    根据国务院指示，会议确定在下半年开展生猪预购、定购工作。目前，政府已经决定拨出一批数量相当大的饲料和资金，帮助和指导农业生产合作社和社员饲养生猪。会议认为当前应该大力提倡社员私人养猪，农业生产合作社在各方面给予帮助，以充分利用社员原有的养猪设备、技术和社员家庭的半劳动力，适当满足社员增加收入的要求。同时，也要帮助农业生产合作社养猪。在生猪价格上，决定在全国范围内分别不同地区适当提高，鼓励农民养猪的积极性。
    会议还研究了工资改革以后可能引起的购买力的变化，具体安排了第三季度北京、上海、天津三大城市的供应计划。这三个城市第三季度的供应量将比去年同期增加20％到30％。此外还分配了各省之间和省、市之间的生猪调拨任务，强调各地要在六月底以前迅速充实货源储备，做好对城市和工矿区的供应，防止脱销。在猪肉供应不足的地区，要扩大羊、禽类食品的供应量，多推销肉类再制品。
