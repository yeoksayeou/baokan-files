    Carry Forward the Legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Further Research into the Treatment of Japanese Encephalitis
    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 13th: As the epidemic season for Japanese encephalitis approaches, the Hebei Provincial Health Department and the Health Workers Association jointly convened a symposium on the exchange of experiences in treating epidemic Japanese encephalitis with traditional Chinese medicine.
    Dr. Guo Keming of Shijiazhuang Infectious Disease Hospital, who has achieved good results in treating Japanese encephalitis and has been awarded by the Ministry of Health, introduced his experiences in treating patients based on their physical condition, illness, season, climate, living environment and other internal and external conditions, as well as how to deal with complications and sequelae. He also discussed how to control dosage when using medicines, and how to replace expensive drugs like "Antelope Horn," "Rhinoceros Horn," and "Bezoar," which are difficult for rural areas to purchase, with inexpensive, highly effective medicines. Dr. Qian Letian of Hebei Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic also introduced some of his experiences in treating Japanese encephalitis. The meeting also widely exchanged experiences in treating Japanese encephalitis with acupuncture combined with medication. On the basis of summarizing last year's work, the meeting focused on studying the patterns of onset and types of Japanese encephalitis, how traditional Chinese medicine can diagnose Japanese encephalitis, and how to save patients who have been misdiagnosed. Through research, past experiences have been further enriched.
    Secret Recipes for Treating Schistosomiasis
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The schistosomiasis prevention and treatment team in the suburbs of Wuhan City has used a variety of publicly available secret recipes of traditional Chinese medicine to cure ascites symptoms in a group of schistosomiasis patients since March.
    In early March, a peasant woman with an abdomen swollen like a water bucket came to the schistosomiasis prevention and treatment team requesting treatment. Based on her condition, the schistosomiasis prevention and treatment team gave her traditional Chinese medicine such as "Quansheng Ascites Pills." After more than twenty days, her abdominal swelling symptoms had completely disappeared. Now, she has participated in agricultural production and can carry loads of about a hundred pounds.
    The schistosomiasis prevention and treatment team working in the suburbs of Wuhan City has successively treated batches of patients using traditional Chinese medicines such as "Quansheng Ascites Pills" and "Da Huang Zhe Chong Wan," with good results.
    "Quansheng Ascites Pills" is one of the publicly available secret recipes of traditional Chinese medicine in Wuhan City. It is made of Croton Seed Frost, Cinnamon, Ferrous Sulfate and other medicines, and has the effect of killing parasites and eliminating swelling. It and other publicly available traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions such as "Da Huang Zhe Chong Wan," "Chansu Pills," and "Shi Zao Wan" are considered effective drugs for treating schistosomiasis.
    Since this spring, more than one hundred secret recipes for treating schistosomiasis have been successively made public by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Wuhan City, of which more than eighty prescriptions have been researched and are being tested in the suburbs of Wuhan City.
  Folk Remedy Cures Lymph Node Tuberculosis
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th: Wei Ruxian, a doctor at the Tiexi Clinic in Anshan City, has cured nine patients suffering from lymph node tuberculosis with a folk remedy.
    Last spring, Wei Ruxian's relative, Li Dianhua, suffered from lymph node tuberculosis and consulted many doctors, but had not been cured. Once, a bricklayer at Li Dianhua's construction site told him that using two qian of sal ammoniac and one hundred crushed soap pods, soaking them in two jin of sorghum vinegar for one day and one night, then baking them dry and grinding them into powder, taking one dose every thirty days, could cure this disease. Li Dianhua took this prescription and studied it with Wei Ruxian and several other traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. After trying the prescription for more than ten days, the ulcerated area closed, and after two months it was completely healed. Afterwards, Wei Ruxian used this prescription to treat eight other patients with lymph node tuberculosis, all of whom achieved significant results.
  "Wang's Baochi Pills" Secret Recipe Made Public
    Our newspaper, Nanjing: The "Wang's Baochi Pills" of Qinghechun Pharmacy in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, is an effective remedy for treating children's milk stagnation, food accumulation, asthma, cough, infantile convulsion and other diseases. It has a history of more than sixty years since its creation and has been sold in Jiangsu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Hong Kong and other places. It was a "family treasure" of this pharmacy, passed down to sons but not to daughters. After the pharmacy became a joint state-private enterprise, the state-owned pharmaceutical company actively helped to develop a customer-ordered decoction service, and the business situation improved. Wang Jinzhi and Li Huizhong, the persons in charge of this store, were greatly moved and voluntarily sent the detailed prescription of "Wang's Baochi Pills" to the state-owned pharmaceutical company, turning the "family treasure" into a "social treasure" to better serve the health of the next generation.
