	New Atmosphere in Secondhand Stores
	Zhang Ke
	One day in late April, Li Zhonghan, an old worker at the Zhongchang Secondhand Store in Xuanwumennei, Beijing, was sorting goods, preparing to receive customers, when he suddenly received a letter from Huadian County, Jilin Province. Li Zhonghan felt a little strange when he saw the envelope: he had no relatives or friends there, so who could have sent it? He hurriedly opened it and saw the ending read "Respectfully, an unacquainted friend, Wang Zhongxing." He then read the contents: "I am a doctor and need a watch for work. I hope to buy a waterproof watch with a pure steel case, large second hand, original strap, no repairs, and about 70-80% new, for a price between 75 and 90 yuan. Please take the time to help me find a good one and send me a letter, and I will remit the money..." Before he could finish reading the letter, Li Zhonghan was already trembling with excitement and his eyes were moist.

	Li Zhonghan is fifty-eight years old this year and has been a worker in pawnshops and secondhand stores for more than forty years, starting as an apprentice at the age of fifteen. He is very familiar with the old practices of secondhand merchants cheating customers, and he is also very clear about the degree of trust customers have in secondhand stores. In the past, secondhand stores conducted business by observing people's expressions and acting accordingly, pressing down prices when people were eager to sell and taking advantage of those who were inexperienced. Once a customer entered the store, they would be pestered and not allowed to leave easily – this was the rule of the trade. Therefore, in the past, secondhand stores were known as an industry where "buying could kill you, selling could kill you, and even if the deal didn't go through, it could still make you angry." Customers entered the store with a certain degree of caution. Now, someone he didn't know had actually sent money from thousands of miles away to buy a watch – this was something that had never happened in a secondhand store before. This not only surprised Li Zhonghan, but also greatly moved and encouraged all the employees in the store. Everyone supported and assisted Li Zhonghan in completing this task and meeting the customer's requirements. Fifteen days later – on May 15th – the Zhongchang store had already purchased an "Avia" waterproof watch according to the customer's specified conditions and sent it out.

	How did Wang Zhongxing come to write a letter to Li Zhonghan? This needs to be explained from the beginning.

	One morning in early March, a person brought a watch to the Zhongchang store to sell, asking for 45 yuan. Li Zhonghan felt that the price was too low. He thought that in the past, this would have been something highly desirable, but now the store was a joint state-private enterprise, and business must be fair and reasonable. Moreover, he had received a lot of education since joining the trade union, and he had also attended a Party class a few days ago, knowing that the working class must establish a world outlook of serving the people, so of course he could no longer engage in deceptive behavior towards customers. When he decided to explain the situation to the customer, he suddenly thought, who doesn't know the value of their own watch? He had to be cautious, so he inquired in detail about the customer's address and work unit, and checked their work permit. Then he said to him, "Your watch is worth more. You can leave it here on consignment, and we will find a buyer for you." The customer listened to him and left the watch. Two days later, the watch was indeed sold for 75 yuan, and after deducting the handling fee, the customer received 22.5 yuan more.

	Not long after, another customer named Yu Yanqiu sold a gemstone to the Shunde store (before it merged) for 200 yuan. When the store sold this gemstone, the price was twice as high as the original price. This was mainly because the initial valuation was inaccurate, so they sent 100 yuan back to Yu's home. At this time, Yu's sixty-three-year-old mother was ill in bed and in urgent need of money. The family was very grateful and said: This is all the benefit the Communist Party has brought us. Similar things later happened repeatedly in Zhongchang and other stores. The newspaper introduced Li Zhonghan's deeds. These things immediately spread, becoming more and more widespread and far-reaching. The reputation of the secondhand stores quickly improved, the number of customers in the stores gradually increased, and many people from faraway places also wrote letters to entrust them with purchasing goods. This letter to Li Zhonghan was just one of many letters.

	The new atmosphere of fair trade and earnest service to customers has become widespread in various secondhand stores in Beijing after the joint state-private ownership transformation. Secondhand stores – this relatively dark corner of society – have also shown a new atmosphere after socialist transformation.

### 旧货行出现了新气象

    旧货行出现了新气象
    张克
    四月底的一天，北京宣武门内中昌旧货商店的老工人李仲涵，正在整理货物，准备接待顾客，忽然接到一封远自吉林省桦甸县寄给他的信。李仲涵看了信封便感到有点稀奇：那里既无亲戚又无朋友，是谁寄来的信呢？急忙拆开一看，信的末尾果然写着“未见面的友人王忠兴敬礼”，再看内容：“我是一个医生，工作需要用表。我希望能买到一只纯钢壳、大三针、原来的条、没有修理过、七八成新的防水手表，价钱在七十五元到九十元之间，请你分神帮助看好表后来个信，我就将款寄上……信还没有看完，李仲涵已经激动得手指颤抖、眼角润湿了。
    李仲涵今年五十八岁，从十五岁当学徒起，一直在当铺、旧货行里做了四十多年的工人。过去旧货商行欺骗顾客的一套作风，他是很熟悉的，顾客对旧货行的信任程度，他也是很清楚的。旧货行做买卖是察言观色看人行事、越急卖越压价，越外行越吃亏。只要顾客一进店门，便被缠住不让随便出来，这是行里的规矩。因此，在过去旧货行是人人皆知的“买能买死了人，卖能卖死了人，买卖不成也能气死了人”的行业，顾客进店都是存有几分戒心的，现在居然有素不相识的人从几千里以外寄钱来买手表，这是旧货行里从来没有过的事情。这不仅使李仲涵感到惊异，全店职工也都受到很大感动和鼓舞，大家都支持并且协助李仲涵完成这个任务，满足顾客要求。十五天后——五月十五日这天，中昌商店已经按照这位顾客规定的条件，代买了一只“阿维亚”防水表寄出。
    王忠兴究竟怎么会写信给李仲涵的呢？这还需要从头讲起。
    三月初的一天上午，有一个人拿只表到中昌商行里卖，要价四十五元。李仲涵一看表便觉得要价偏低，他想，要在过去，那正是求之不得的事情，但现在商行已经公私合营，买卖必须公平合理。再说自己参加工会后已经受到了不少教育，几天前还听了党课，知道工人阶级必须确立为人民服务的人生观，当然不能再有欺骗顾客的行为。当他决定要向这位顾客说明情况的时候，忽又想起哪有不知自己表的价值的人呢？还得警惕些，于是又详细询问了这位顾客的住址、工作单位，并且查验了工作证，然后对他说：“你的表还能多值，可以放在这里寄售，我们替你找主。”顾客听了他的话便把表留下，两天后，表果然卖了七十五元，除手续费外，替顾客多卖了二十二元五角。
    没过几天，又有一位名叫于彦秋的顾客，二百元卖了一块宝石给并店前的顺德商行，商行卖出这块宝石的时候价钱比原来高一倍，这主要是当时估价不准确，便又送回一百元到于家去，这时于家六十三岁的老太太正在卧病，急需用钱，一家都很感激地说：这都是共产党带给我们的好处。像这样的事情后来又连续在中昌等商行出现好多起。报上介绍了李仲涵的事迹。这些事情马上就流传开了，越传越广越传越远，旧货行的信誉很快就提高了，门市顾客逐渐增加，远地也有很多人写信委托代买货物。这封给李仲涵的信只是许多信件中的一封。
    买卖公平，认真为顾客服务的新风气，已经在公私合营后的北京市各个旧货商行里普遍出现。旧货行——这个社会上比较阴暗的角落，经过社会主义改造以后，也出现了新的气象。
