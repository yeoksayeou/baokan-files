I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," Minister Liao Luyan's "Explanation on the Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China."

Since the Second Session of the First National People's Congress last July, nearly a year has passed. In this year, all aspects of the motherland have developed rapidly, and the national situation has undergone tremendous changes, inspiring all ethnic groups.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, living in the great family of the motherland, are more closely united around the Chinese Communist Party, the State Council, and Chairman Mao in this great upsurge of socialist construction. They are full of confidence in building their beautiful homeland. In the past year, under the leadership of the Party and government at higher levels, we completed democratic reform (land reform) in agricultural areas, developed mutual assistance and cooperation and agricultural production, as well as other construction work.

Now I will briefly report these situations to the congress:

Regarding the issue of democratic reform. In the years since liberation, the shackles of feudal production relations in the rural areas of the autonomous prefecture still seriously restricted rural productivity and hindered the enthusiasm of farmers for production. Some feudal lords did not cherish the labor of the masses, arbitrarily imposed corvée and grain levies. Laboring people had to spend more than one-third of their time engaged in unpaid labor. The people's lives and property were not guaranteed, and behaviors such as arbitrary arrests and fines that violated the constitution continued to exist. Farmers could not tolerate this unreasonable situation, and coupled with the fact that their own living conditions could not be improved, they successively demanded democratic reform in order to achieve a thorough emancipation politically and economically.

Based on this aspiration of the working people and the wishes of public figures from all ethnic groups, the Party and the government submitted a proposal to the Second People's Representative Conference of the former Autonomous Region and the First Session of the Second People's Representative Conference of the Autonomous Prefecture. After discussion and approval, it was decided to carry out democratic reform in the agricultural areas in a moderate manner.

Adhering to the principles of benefiting ethnic unity and developing production, we adopted an organized and led, moderate approach to carry out democratic reform in the agricultural areas of ten counties including Mao County. Over the past year, we have completed the great democratic reform in 260,000 people's areas in stages and batches, distributing more than 442,000 mu of land and surplus plowing livestock and agricultural implements to 37,994 landless and land-poor farmers, accounting for 63.3% of the total number of farmers.

Farmers obtained land, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. They worked diligently on their own land. The field ridges and unused ditches that had been washed away by floods decades ago were repaired. The stone piles and gravel accumulated in the land were never removed before, but now they are being dug up. Farmers in Fushun Township, Mao County, removed nearly 200,000 loads of gravel from more than 1,000 mu of land. Before the land reform in Zhuangziping, the government repeatedly called for the construction of terraced fields, but no one responded. After the land reform, 50 mu of irrigatable ditches were renovated and newly built within 10 days.

In the democratic reform, we fully adopted a policy of protection and care for the upper-class people and representatives of religious circles in our ethnic group. These people have all been given specific and appropriate arrangements. A large number of them have been or will be absorbed to participate in work; those who cannot participate in work due to poor health or other reasons have also been given appropriate care in life, and their due political future has been guaranteed, so as to achieve reasonable arrangements.

Regarding the land issue of temples. In the democratic reform, the government, in accordance with the wishes of the people and religious leaders, on the one hand, implemented the Party and government's policy of freedom of religious belief and protection of religion; on the other hand, the economic relations between temples and the masses were also appropriately resolved as necessary.

After the democratic reform was completed, people's representative conferences of various townships (towns) were convened. On the basis of fully promoting democracy, members of the governments of various townships (towns) were elected, and the various tasks of the government were discussed and reviewed, making the relationship between the Party and government and the masses closer and the political power more consolidated.

The above facts fully prove that it is completely necessary, timely, and correct to implement democratic reform in our region.

After the reform, the difficulties of poor and lower-middle peasants and some middle peasants in production materials were resolved, which greatly stimulated the farmers' production enthusiasm. Furthermore, under the socialist education, farmers are more actively demanding to organize themselves and take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Many farmers submitted applications repeatedly.

Based on the above situation, a number of cooperatives and mutual aid teams were established. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 298 elementary agricultural production cooperatives, 1 advanced cooperative, and 1,007 mutual aid teams were established in the prefecture. The number of farmers joining the cooperatives accounted for 14.4% of the total number of farmers, and the organized farmers accounted for 34.78% of the total number of households.

The organized agricultural cooperatives have played a positive role in resisting natural disasters, promoting advanced experiences, and improving farming techniques. Last year, the organized farmers generally increased production by 5%-20% compared with individual farmers. The total income of farmers in the Qianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mao County increased by 24.9% compared with 1954, and the average income of cooperative members increased by 22.3%. The wheat production of the Zang minority mutual aid team in Xiaoshuigou, Ma'erkang, in 1955 increased by 32% compared with 1954, and corn production increased by 20%.

Regarding the issue of production. In the past year, we have basically implemented the policy of "focusing on increasing grain production and adopting measures suitable to local conditions to develop forestry, animal husbandry, and other diversified economies." We have strengthened the leadership of agricultural production, widely conducted propaganda and education, and convened various meetings to inspire the enthusiasm of the masses. At the same time, we have issued various loans (a total of 546,200 yuan of agricultural loans and more than 249,300 yuan of relief funds have been issued in the past year) and various agricultural machinery and implements (about 16,000 pieces), which have strongly supported poor farmers.

In promoting advanced experiences and improving farming techniques, we have organized observation, exchanges of experiences through experimental demonstrations by farms, agricultural technology stations, and state-owned mechanized farms. As a result, many counties are comprehensively promoting "double-seedling dense planting" sowing and crop rotation systems, and are trying out various new types of agricultural implements.

This has ensured the increase in agricultural production. For example, the grain output in 1955 increased by 10 million jin compared with 1954, and this year it will increase by another 15 million to 19 million jin. At present, farmers have a high enthusiasm for production, and the production increase targets set by various counties have already been exceeded. Some cooperatives, after discussion by the masses, have set new production increase targets of 20%-80%.

However, there are also problems in various democratic reform movements. It should be pointed out that although the reform work was carried out in accordance with the wishes of the vast working people and public figures of all ethnic groups, and after consultation and discussion by the representative conference, and was carried out in a moderate manner, there are still a few feudal lords who do not understand righteousness, are unwilling to give up too unreasonable exploitation, and are unwilling to withdraw from the political stage of feudal lords, or are worried that their lives and political status will become problematic after the reform. Therefore, under the instigation of the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits and special agents, they exaggerated some individual shortcomings in our work as an excuse to create ethnic antagonism, and as a result, rebellions occurred in some areas. The result of this rebellion is unfavorable to the unity between the Tibetan, Han, and other ethnic groups and to the development and progress of the Tibetan people themselves. The government has adopted a lenient policy of not pursuing the past, educating and striving for the participation of those who participated in the rebellion, and has strived to bring all those who were deceived and coerced back to the government's side, thereby isolating the enemy, crushing the conspiracies of the bandits and special agents, and quelling the rebellion.

I myself am one of the big Tusi of this prefecture. Before the democratic reform, I also had some concerns and anxieties. However, in the reform movement, under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the government, my own political awareness has been improved, and I have automatically given up various privileges of feudal exploitation. Now I am a people's representative and hold the position of deputy governor of the autonomous prefecture. This not only improves my political status, but also properly handles my personal and family life. This not only safeguards the interests of the masses, but also promotes me to embark on the bright road of socialism. Now, when I look back, the many concerns and fears I had about democratic reform before the reform, after my own personal experience, are completely superfluous and unnecessary. Here, I sincerely thank the Party and the government for their kind care and proper arrangements for the upper-class people of our ethnic group. In the future, we must strive forward and contribute our own strength to the lofty cause of building socialism in the great motherland.

Fellow representatives: Our Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has just ended its democratic reform, and various constructions are just beginning. Many tasks are waiting for us to do. We must further consolidate the people's power on the basis of democratic reform, greatly develop the economy and culture of our prefecture, and improve the lives of the people of all ethnic groups. Our people of all ethnic groups, especially the Tibetan people, must resolutely and actively work and strive for the common realization of socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    阿坝藏族自治州进行民主改革以后
    ——索观瀛代表的发言
    我完全拥护李先念副总理“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明”及彭真副委员长关于“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”。
    自去年七月召开第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议以来到现在将近一年，在这一年中，祖国各方面都在飞跃发展，全国形势起了一个极大的变化，各族人民无不欢欣鼓舞。
    生活在祖国大家庭的阿坝藏族自治州的各族人民，在这伟大的社会主义建设高潮中更加亲密地团结在中国共产党、国务院和毛主席的周围，满怀信心地建设我们自己美好的家乡，一年来我们在上级党、政领导下，农业区完成了民主改革（土地改革），发展了互助合作和农业生产，以及其他各项建设工作。
    现在我把这些情况简单地向大会作一汇报：
    关于民主改革问题。解放几年来，自治州农村封建生产关系的锁链，仍严重地束缚了农村生产力，阻碍了农民生产的积极性，一些封建主对群众的劳动力不加爱护，任意派差、派粮，劳动群众一年要付出三分之一以上的时间从事无偿劳役，人民的生命财产没有保障，如随便捕讯和任意罚款等违背宪法的行为还继续存在。这种不合理的情况，农民实在不能忍受，加以自身生活要求不能得到改善，便纷纷提出民主改革的要求，以便在政治上、经济上得到彻底的翻身。
    党和政府根据劳动人民这一愿望和各民族中的公众领袖人物的意愿，向原自治区首届二次人民代表会议和自治州第二届人民代表会议第一次会议提出，经讨论通过，决议在农业区用和缓的方式进行民主改革。
    本着有利于民族团结和发展生产的原则，采取有组织、有领导，运用和缓的方式，在茂县等十县农业区进行民主改革。一年多来分期分批地在26万人口的地区完成了伟大的民主改革，以442，000多亩地及多余的耕畜农具，分给了37，994户无地少地的农民，占总农户63.3％。
    农民得到了土地，生产积极性大大提高，在自己的土地上勤劳耕作，几十年前被洪水冲垮的田坎和不用的水沟修复了，堆在土地里的石包和碎石从未拣过，现在也挖除了。茂县富顺乡农民在1，000多亩的土地上，拣除了近20万背的碎石头，该乡庄子坪土改前，政府再三号召兴修梯田，没人响应，而土改后短短10天内便整修和新修了可灌溉50多亩的水沟。
    在民主改革中，对我们民族中上层人士和宗教界的代表，完全采取了保护和照顾的政策，这些人士都作了具体的、妥善的安排。有很大一批人已吸收或将吸收他们参加工作；有些因身体不好或其他原因不能参加工作的，也在生活上作了适当的照顾，在政治上保证了应有的出路，作到合理安排。
    对寺庙的土地问题。在民主改革中，政府根据人民群众和宗教领袖人物的意愿，一方面贯彻了党和政府关于宗教信仰自由和保护宗教的政策；另一方面寺庙与群众的经济关系，也作了必要的适当的解决。
    民主改革结束后，接着召开了各乡（镇）的人民代表会议，在充分发扬民主的基础上选出了各乡（镇）政府的委员，讨论和审查了政府的各项工作，使党政与群众的关系更加密切，政权更加巩固了。
    以上事实充分证明了在我区实行民主改革是完全必要、适时和正确的。
    改革后贫雇农和部分中农在生产资料上的困难获得了解决，这样就大大刺激了农民的生产情绪。再加以农民在社会主义教育下更积极要求组织起来走互助合作的道路。许多农民三番五次递了申请。
    根据以上情况，办了一批合作社、互助组，据不完全统计，全州共建立初级农业生产社298个，高级社1个，互助组1，007个，入社农户占了总农户的14.4％，组织起来的农民已占总户数的34.78％。
    组织起来的农业合作社，在抵抗自然灾害、推广先进经验、改进耕作技术等方面，已发挥了积极的作用。去年组织起来的农民，一般比单干户增产5％—20％，茂县前峰农业生产合作社全社农户总收入比1954年增加24.9％，社员平均收入增加了22.3％，马尔康小水沟藏民互助组1955年的麦子比1954年增产32％，玉麦增产20％。
    关于生产的问题。一年来我们在生产方面，基本上贯彻了“以增产粮食为主，并采取因地制宜，发展林牧等多种经济”的方针，我们加强了农业生产的领导，广泛地进行宣传教育，召开各种会议，以启发群众的热情，同时发放了各种贷款（农贷年来共发放了546，200元，救济款249，300多元）和各类农械药具（约16，000多件），有力的扶持了贫苦农民。
    在推广先进经验，改进耕作技术方面，是通过农场农技站和国营机械农场的实验示范，组织观摩、交流经验，因而许多县都在全面推广“双株密植”点播和轮种制，试用各类新式农具。
    这样就使农业的增产有了保证，如1955年的粮食产量就比1954年增加1，000万斤，而今年又将增加1，500到1，900万斤。目前农民生产情绪很高，各县所订增产计划指标，业已被突破。有些合作社在经过群众讨论后，订出增产20％—80％的新的计划指标。
    但是，在各项民主改革运动中，也不是没有问题的，应当指出：虽然改革工作是根据广大劳动人民和各民族中的公众人物的意愿，经过代表会议协商讨论通过，并以和缓方式去进行，但仍有少数封建主不明大义，不愿意放弃太不合理的剥削，不愿意退出封建主的政治舞台，或者担心怕在改革之后生活与政治地位成问题，因而在国民党残余匪特的挑拨煽动下，扩大我们工作中的某些个别缺点作借口来制造民族的对立，因而在部分地区发生过叛乱。这种叛乱的结果，无论对于藏汉等各民族间的团结和藏族本身的发展和进步上都是不利的。政府对于参加叛乱的分子，采取了既往不究，教育争取的宽大政策，争取了一切被欺骗和裹胁的人回到政府方面来，从而孤立了敌人，粉碎了匪特的阴谋活动，平息了叛乱。
    我本人是本州的一个大土司之一，在民主改革前，也多少有过顾虑和不安，但是在改革运动中，在党和政府的领导、帮助下，自己的政治觉悟提高了，自动放弃了封建剥削的各种特权，现在我身为人民代表，并担负着自治州副州长的工作，这不仅使得我的政治地位获得了提高，同时我个人和家庭的生活也有了妥善的处理，这是既维护了群众的利益，同时又推动了我自己走上了社会主义的光明大道。现在我回想起来，我在改革前对于民主改革的许多顾虑和害怕，经过我个人亲身的体验，完全是多余的，不必要的。我在这里衷心的感谢党和政府对我们民族上层人士的亲切照顾和妥善安排的盛意，在今后我们要在伟大祖国建设社会主义的崇高事业中，努力前进，贡献出自身的一分力量。
    各位代表：我们阿坝藏族自治州民主改革刚结束，各种建设也正在开始，许多工作正等待我们去做，我们必须在民主改革的基础上进一步巩固人民政权，更大地发展我州的经济、文化和改善各族人民的生活，我们各族人民，特别是藏族人民，必须坚决地、积极地工作，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下为共同实现社会主义而奋斗。
