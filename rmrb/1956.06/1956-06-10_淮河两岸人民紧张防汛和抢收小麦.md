    淮河两岸人民紧张防汛和抢收小麦
    新华社合肥9日电　截至九日下午五时，安徽省淮河中下游地区的大雨已经逐渐停止下来，淮河上游地区仍在继续下雨。很多地方几天来的雨量已经达到了三百公厘左右。淮河干流蚌埠水位九日已经接近警戒水位，王家坝、正阳关的水位已超过警戒水位。今天上午，王家坝已经实行分洪。
    现在，沿淮地区农民投入防汛、排涝的已达七十八万多人。安徽省淮河干支流的防水指挥机构都已上堤办公。近十万干部和大批防汛器材都已源源投入了紧张的防汛斗争。中国共产党安徽省委员会还从省直属机关抽调了一部分领导干部赶赴沿淮地区。蚌埠、阜阳两专区也从近山地区抽调了大批力量帮助淮河干支流两岸排涝和抢收小麦。
    据新华社蚌埠9日电　今天蚌埠市出动了近万人的抢收队伍，冒大雨帮助农民抢收小麦。这些队伍是蚌埠市机关干部和驻蚌部队分别组成的。
