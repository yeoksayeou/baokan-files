Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Qingqi reports: In recent months, the Lianyi Small Merchandise Wholesale Store, located in a remote alley in Taiyuan City, has been bustling with people coming to purchase small merchandise. Public-private joint venture department stores, retail company business offices, clothing production cooperatives, peddlers, hawkers, and vendors in Taiyuan City all come here to buy goods, and supply and marketing cooperatives from more than twenty counties in the province also frequently send people here to purchase small merchandise.

The Lianyi Small Merchandise Wholesale Store was formed by the joint organization of twenty-one wholesalers in January this year as a public-private joint venture. At that time, because they were not familiar with the channels for procuring goods and the needs of customers, the turnover in January was only 18,000 yuan. However, from February onwards, the turnover rose sharply, doubling in February compared to January, rising to 130,000 yuan in May, and the plan for June is 180,000 yuan.

The reporter visited the store a few days ago. Sun Chenghu, the deputy director of the store, told the reporter: "The rapid increase in the store's turnover is mainly due to the good coordination and cooperation of the state-owned department store wholesale department, which has changed the procurement relationship."

He said that the commodities operated by the store are divided into three categories: first, commodities currently needed by the market; second, scattered commodities not operated by the state-owned companies in Taiyuan; and third, commodities that are out of stock in state-owned companies. The store has stationed purchasers in Beijing and Shanghai, responsible for procurement in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Changzhou and other regions. The store has also set up a mobile purchaser who goes out for special purchases at any time. In mid-March this year, the white gloves supplied by the state-owned company in Taiyuan were out of stock, and the Lianyi Small Merchandise Wholesale Store immediately asked the purchaser stationed in Beijing to purchase 5,000 dozen white gloves. In early May, the Taiyuan Hat Production Cooperative produced a large number of summer cool hats for children, but lacked hat flowers and needed to buy 10,000 hat flowers within a week. The Lianyi Small Merchandise Wholesale Store telegraphed the purchaser stationed in Beijing again, and 20,000 were airlifted within five days, meeting the needs of the market. In early February, before the Spring Festival, the state-owned company asked the Lianyi Small Merchandise Wholesale Store to purchase a large number of clay figurines, wooden figurines, marbles and other children's toys from Beijing, Shanghai and other places to supply the Taiyuan market.

The Lianyi Small Merchandise Wholesale Store currently operates more than 950 kinds of commodities; and there are many varieties of goods, with seven or eighty categories of hair clips alone. The wholesale store frequently studies market changes and customer opinions, and maintains close contact with purchasers. Sometimes, purchasers stationed in Beijing and Shanghai discover a new commodity and transport some samples back to Taiyuan for trial sales. Therefore, the store's counters often maintain a wide variety of goods, which has won the praise of small merchandise stores, peddlers, hawkers, and vendors.

    经常研究市场需要、积极改进进货工作
    联一小百货批发店营业额直线上升
    据新华社太原11日电　新华社记者高庆琪报道：最近几个月来，座落在太原市一条偏僻小巷的公私合营联一小百货批发店，每天熙熙攘攘，前来采购小百货的人往来不断。太原市各公私合营百货门市部、零售公司营业处、服装生产合作社以及游商、货郎担、摊贩都到这里来买货，全省还有二十多个县的供销合作社也时常派人到这里来采购小百货。
    联一小百货批发店是由二十一户批发商联合组织在今年一月实行公私合营的。当时因为在货源调进和顾客需要上摸不着门径，一月份营业额只有一万八千元，但是从二月份起，营业额直线上升，二月份比一月份增加一倍，五月份上升到十三万元，六月份计划为十八万元。
    日前，记者走访了这个商店。商店副主任孙承嘏对记者说：“商店营业额上升得这样快，主要是国营百货公司批发部门协作配合的好，改变了进货关系所致。”
    他说，这个商店经营的商品分为三种：第一是当前市场需要的商品，第二是太原市国营公司不经营的零星商品，第三是国营公司脱销的商品。商店在北京、上海两地派驻了采购员，负责北京、天津、上海、南京、常州等地区的采购工作，商店内又设立了一个机动采购员，随时出外突击采购。在今年三月中旬，太原市国营公司供应的白手套脱销，联一小百货批发店当即要驻北京的采购员采购了白手套五千打。五月上旬太原市制帽生产合作社制出了大批儿童夏季用凉帽，但是缺少帽花，需要在一个星期内买到一万颗帽花，联一小百货批发店又电告驻北京的采购员，五天内就空运到两万颗，满足了市场的需要。在二月初春节的前夕，国营公司曾经要联一小百货批发店从北京、上海等地采购了大批泥人、木人、弹球等儿童玩具供应了太原市场。
    联一小百货批发店目前经营的商品达到九百五十多种；而且货色很多，仅发卡一项就有七、八十类。批发店经常研究市场的变化和顾主的意见，同采购员保持密切联系，有时驻北京、上海两地的采购员发现一种新商品，就运回一部分样品到太原试销。因此商店的柜台上经常保持多种多样的商品，博得了小百货商店、游商、货郎担、摊贩的好评。
