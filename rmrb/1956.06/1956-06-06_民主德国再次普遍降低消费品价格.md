Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th - East Germany announced its seventeenth general reduction in consumer goods prices. The decree lowering prices came into effect yesterday.

This price reduction will increase residents' purchasing power by 1.5 billion marks annually.

According to the decree, textile prices have been reduced by 25% to 30%, ready-to-wear outerwear by up to 60%, and footwear by 25% to 30%. Children's clothing prices have been reduced by an average of 35%.

The prices of much-needed industrial products have also been reduced. For example, bicycle prices have been reduced by 20%, camera prices by 20% to 30%, radios by 35%, and refrigerators by 20%.

At a press conference announcing the price reduction, Professor Oelsner, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of East Germany, compared the situation with that of West Germany. He pointed out that although West Germany's output is also constantly increasing, prices are not falling but rising. The prices of rent, gas, electricity, fares, coal, household goods and food have all increased. In 1955 alone, food prices rose by 12.5%, and in the first few months of this year, there has been a further increase.

    民主德国再次普遍降低消费品价格
    新华社柏林5日电　民主德国宣布第十七次普遍降低消费品价格。降低价格的法令已经在昨天开始生效。
    这次降低物价将使居民购买力每年增加十五亿马克。
    根据这项法令的规定，纺织品价格降低了25％到30％，出门穿的现成服装降低最多的到60％，鞋类降低25％到30％。儿童服装价格平均降低35％。
    大量需要的工业品的价格也降低了，例如，自行车的价格降低20％，照像机的价格降低20％到30％，收音机降低35％，冰箱降低20％。
    在宣布降低物价这个消息的记者招待会上，民主德国部长会议副主席厄斯纳教授以西德的情况作了对比。他指出，虽然西德的产量也在不断地增加，但是物价不是在下降而是在上涨。房租、煤气、电力、车费、煤、家庭用品和食品的价格都已经上涨。单是在1955年，食品价格就上涨了12.5％，而在今年头几个月中，又有进一步的上涨。
