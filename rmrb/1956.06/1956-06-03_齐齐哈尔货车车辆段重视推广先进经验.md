To the Editor:

The Qiqihar Freight Car Depot of the Qiqihar Railway Administration has earnestly promoted advanced experience, comprehensively overfulfilling its production tasks in April, eliminating accidents of all sizes, and accumulating more than 10,600 yuan in funds for the state.

In March of this year, under the impetus of the advanced producer movement, the leadership of the Freight Car Depot conducted a review of the promotion of advanced experience throughout the depot. They found that because this work had not received universal attention, the promotion of some advanced experiences was very poor. For example, although the depot had promoted thirty-seven types of quick repair advanced experiences, only 32.6% of the total number of people could actually use them relatively skillfully.

Based on the results of the inspection, the leadership of the Freight Car Depot strengthened specific leadership work in promoting advanced experience. They designated engineering and technical personnel to go deep into the repair shop, separately summarizing the seventeen types of technical operating experiences of riveter Jiao Yongchang, spring worker Zhao Chengfa, car inspectors Chen Xiwwen, Wang Santu, and others. They then organized demonstration performances, using comparative methods to educate and help workers accept advanced experience. For example, car inspector Wei Xianjiang initially disbelieved Wang Santu's experience of not missing inspections. Later, Wang Santu discovered a pillow spring fracture that was very difficult to detect during a demonstration performance, while Wei Xianjiang missed this fault when he inspected it using his own method. In this way, not only was Wei Xianjiang convinced, but other employees were also happy to learn Wang Santu's experience.

The leadership of the Freight Car Depot also organized employees to sign master-apprentice contracts to improve their technical level. From the beginning of March to the end of April, one-third of the workers in the depot had signed master-apprentice contracts. In this work, the leadership paid attention to implementing the competition principle of mutual learning and common improvement, adopting a method of one master leading two apprentices, which was welcomed by the employees.

In addition, the depot also established technical research groups and advanced method training classes, all of which disseminated various advanced experiences in a timely and effective manner.

    齐齐哈尔货车车辆段重视推广先进经验编辑同志：
    齐齐哈尔铁路管理局齐齐哈尔货车车辆段认真推广先进经验，在四月份全面超额完成了生产任务，消灭了大小事故，并且给国家多积累资金一万零六千多元。
    今年三月，货车车辆段的领导人员在先进生产者运动的推动下，对全段的先进经验推广情况作了一次检查，发现由于这项工作没有受到普遍的重视，有些先进经验的推广情况很不好，像段里虽然推广了三十七种快速修先进经验，但是实际上能够比较熟练地运用的人只占总人数的32.6％。
    根据检查的结果，货车车辆段的领导方面就加强了对推广先进经验的具体领导工作。他们指定了工程技术人员深入到修车厂，分别总结了铆工焦永昶、弹簧工赵成法、检车员陈希文、王三秃等人的十七种技术操作经验，然后组织示范表演，通过对比的方法来教育和帮助工人接受先进经验。例如，检车员魏献江开始对王三秃的不漏检经验不信服，后来王三秃在示范表演中发现了一个很不容易发现的枕簧折损故障，魏献江用自己的方法进行检查就漏过了这个故障。这样，不但魏献江心服了，而且其他职工也都乐意地来学习王三秃的经验。
    货车车辆段的领导方面还组织职工用签订师徒合同的方法来提高技术水平。从三月份开始到四月末，全段已经有三分之一的工人签订师徒合同。在这项工作中，领导方面注意贯彻了互相学习，共同提高的竞赛原则，采用了一个师傅带两个徒弟的方法，受到了职工们的欢迎。
    此外，段里还成立了技术研究小组和先进方法训练班等，都及时有效地传播了各种先进经验。                   　王治中
