    国际新闻工作者会见结束
    一致通过关于新闻报道要客观和真实等决议
    新华社赫尔辛基15日电　有四十二个国家的代表参加的国际新闻工作者会见六月十四日晚间在赫尔辛基附近的欧坦尼米闭幕。这次会见是在认真、友好和互相谅解的精神下举行的。
    大会一致通过了关于新闻报道的客观和真实、关于保证记者工作的物质条件和职业尊严、关于各国新闻工作者组织和个人间的联系和合作等决议。大会希望各国新闻工作者团体主动采取措施，促进现有的新闻工作者的国际性组织的接近。
    参加会见的各国代表在决议中指出，忠于合作和团结事业的新闻工作者意识到自己在宣传各国人民间的真诚和互谅精神方面的特殊作用和责任。为此，他们保证在执行自己的职务的时候要客观、真实和忠诚，把联合国新闻自由问题委员会所草拟的关于新闻工作者荣誉的国际守则的原则当作自己活动的基础。
    参加会见的各国代表还主张新闻工作者不分民族、种族、宗教和政治信仰，都能够自由来往和不受阻碍地进行活动。新闻工作者在国外旅行方面应当得到一些优待。
    参加会见的各国代表认为，在互惠的基础上，各报社、通讯社、无线电台和电视中心交换广播和电视节目以及各种材料，大规模地组织各国新闻工作者进行集体的或个人的旅行，举办新闻记者、文艺批评家、体育记者、摄影记者等的国际会议，都是很重要的。
    各国代表决定保留筹备这次会见的发起委员会，以便使它在国际新闻工作者的团结方面继续发挥力量。
