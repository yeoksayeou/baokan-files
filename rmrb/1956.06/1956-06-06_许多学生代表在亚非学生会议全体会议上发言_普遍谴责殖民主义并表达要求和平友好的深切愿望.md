Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, June 5th: At the plenary session of the Asian-African Student Conference on June 3rd, Egyptian representative Mohammed Zidan, on behalf of his delegation, suggested the establishment of an "Asian-African Youth Federation," with headquarters in both Asia and Africa.

Zidan said that the main goal of the federation was to promote common friendship and understanding among the youth of Africa and Asia. He put forward ten goals for the federation, including: ending foreign colonial systems in all Asian and African countries, working together to strengthen world peace and achieve social justice, and fighting against foreign treaties that may lead to war, etc.

Next, Algerian student representative Mohammed Ben Yahia spoke. He described the tragic situation of Algerian students under French colonialism. He pointed out that the only solution to the current situation in Algeria is to eliminate the shackles of colonialism and change the Algerian political system. The Algerian representative said: "Algerian students, now from the depths of their prisons, in the flames of struggle, are watching Bandung, and hope to receive understanding and help from you."

The Algerian student representative's speech was greeted with prolonged and enthusiastic applause and cheers.

Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, June 4th: The plenary session of the Asian-African Student Conference continued on the morning of the 4th.

The first speaker was Zhang Ruihuan, head of the student delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In his speech, he first introduced the learning situation of students in northern Korea. He pointed out that despite the difficult conditions for the restoration and construction of the people's economy after the war, the government of the Republic still placed the restoration and construction of educational equipment in an important position.

He also talked about the tragic situation of young people and students in South Korea. He expressed regret that no South Korean student representatives came here to participate in the conference. Zhang Ruihuan asked the conference and all Asian and African students to support the proposals put forward by the Korean people and students regarding the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Philippine representative De Vega said in his speech that he would not recognize the statement issued by the International Preparatory Committee. He criticized the International Preparatory Committee for not inviting representatives from Singapore and Bangkok. However, he immediately said that his speech was not made on behalf of his delegation, and he was only talking about his personal opinions.

At this time, the Singapore representative requested to speak. He refuted De Vega's speech, saying that the Singapore student representatives were actually included in the Malayan student delegation.

Pakistani student representative Ahmed Navi emphasized the importance of seeking common ground in his speech. At the same time, he requested the conference not to discuss political issues that might cause division and discord. He believes that discussing and deciding on political issues is a matter for politicians.

The Laotian representative also spoke at the meeting, saying that we are not here to defend political views. We are here to seek agreement and lay the foundation for a plan of common action. He hopes that the conference may generate a spirit of friendship and peace.

The Japanese student representative said that we should not forget the people who are forced to live a painful life under colonial rule today. He recalled the damage suffered in the last World War. He said that we will fight against all forms of colonialism together with students from all countries, and at the same time, we will firmly extend our arms of support to those students who are fighting heroically under colonial rule.

Finally, the Japanese student representative suggested that the conference discuss four points, including increasing mutual understanding and friendship between students of various countries, demanding a ban on the production and testing of atomic weapons, defending peace, and preventing another war.

The Syrian student representative began his speech by denouncing colonialism. He pointed out that what we are talking about in relation to decolonization is not just a political issue. It is a question of promoting learning, it is a question of the fundamental survival of our students under colonial oppression, or more precisely, in the orbit of imperialism. It is impossible to talk about developing education in countries where the regime is in the hands of foreigners. It is impossible to talk about promoting culture without talking about decolonization—the number one enemy of culture and the dissemination of knowledge.

He emphasized that history has never recorded any progress in education in colonial countries. On the contrary, colonialists stifle national culture and distort education. They hinder any progress in culture and the dissemination of knowledge.

Sudanese student chief representative Dafa’ala Hag Yousuf, in his speech at the plenary session this morning, emphasized the universal desire for peace and friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, June 5th: The Asian-African Student Conference continued its plenary session on the afternoon of June 4th.

The first speaker at the meeting was Iranian representative Javad Vafa. He said that colonialism is not the only problem facing Asians and Africans, nor is it the only problem that "many people will continue to face at some point in the future." The Iranian representative, who came directly from the United States, told the student representatives not to talk about politics, otherwise they would lose the time to increase their knowledge.

The Moroccan representative told the representatives that in March of this year, the French rulers finally allowed his country to become independent. But he said that this victory is not complete.

He said that as a result of French colonization, more than 90% of his country's people are illiterate. He said, "Colonialism has completely isolated us, preventing us from contacting students in other places outside our country; this year, we are finally free, so we can contact many students, and we hope that because of this meeting, we will establish solid and friendly ties between us." He hoped that the second Asian-African Student Conference and regional student conferences would be considered as ways to strengthen friendly relations between students. He said: "For all of us, peace is in fact urgently needed." He believes that every student should promote peace in his own country.

Representatives from Jordan, Cameroon, Madagascar, China, and Malaya also spoke at the meeting. (The speech of Qian Liren, the head of the Chinese delegation, can be found on the fourth page)

After a short recess, the meeting resumed at 11:00 PM. Representatives from Nepal, India, Togo, North Vietnam, and West Africa spoke at the meeting.

Nepali representative Jadish Jeha said: "We Nepali students welcome the action of the International Preparatory Committee to mobilize various forces of the student movement, regardless of political views, thereby preparing conditions for a common surge of freedom, peace, and progress."

Li Guangquan, head of the Vietnamese student delegation, said: Students in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are very eager to cooperate and engage in friendly exchanges with students from other countries. They all hope that this meeting will allow them to see the realization of the desire of Asian and African students to establish broader cooperation in education, culture, sports exchanges, and travel. They also hope that this meeting will actively contribute to enabling all Asian and African students to study in peaceful and independent homelands.

In his speech, Li Guangquan introduced the improvement of learning conditions and the development of education for students in northern Vietnam after the realization of peace. He said that northern Vietnam is already carrying out the work of developing national culture and conducting cultural exchanges with foreign countries. Friendly cooperation with students from other countries has always been a guiding principle in the activities of Vietnamese students.

Li Guangquan said that now that our country has restored peace, and most Asian and African countries have gained their national sovereignty. After the Bandung Conference last year, the relations between students in these countries have also been strengthened. All of this makes us deeply aware of the fact that without peace and national independence, our studies cannot be improved, our national culture cannot be developed, and our students cannot have any friendly exchanges. Therefore, we believe that peace and national independence should not be regarded merely as purely political issues, but also as the necessary background for developing our studies, our national culture, and friendly cooperation between students. Therefore, peace and national independence are very precious to Vietnamese students. Therefore, we support all activities aimed at consolidating peace and easing international tensions.

    许多学生代表在亚非学生会议全体会议上发言
    普遍谴责殖民主义并表达要求和平友好的深切愿望
    据新华社万隆5日电　出席亚非学生会议的埃及代表穆罕默德·齐丹代表他的代表团在六月三日的全体会议上建议成立“亚非青年联合会”，这个联合会将在亚洲和非洲各设一个总部。
    齐丹说，联合会的主要目标是要促进非洲和亚洲青年的共同友谊和了解。他提出了联合会的十项目标，其中包括：结束在亚非所有国家中的外国殖民制度，通力合作加强世界和平和实现社会正义以及同可能导致战争的外国条约进行斗争等等。
    接着阿尔及利亚学生代表穆罕默德·本雅希亚发言。他描述了阿尔及利亚学生在法国殖民主义统治下所处的悲惨情况。他指出，阿尔及利亚目前情况的唯一解决办法就是：消除殖民主义桎梏，改变阿尔及利亚的政治制度。阿尔及利亚代表说：“阿尔及利亚学生现在从他们的牢狱深处，在斗争的烈火中，注视着万隆，并且希望从你们那里得到了解和帮助。”
    阿尔及利亚学生代表的讲话博得了听众们长时间的热烈的鼓掌欢呼。
    据新华社万隆4日电　亚非学生会议全体会议四日上午继续举行。
    第一个发言的是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国学生代表团团长张瑞焕。他在发言中首先介绍朝鲜北部学生的学习情况。他指出，尽管战后人民经济的恢复和建设条件很困难，共和国政府还是把教育设备的恢复和建设放在重要地位。
    他还谈到了南朝鲜青年和学生的悲惨情况。他对于没有南朝鲜学生代表到这里来参加会议表示遗憾。张瑞焕要求会议和全体亚非学生支持朝鲜人民和学生所提出的关于和平统一祖国的建议。
    菲律宾代表德维加在会上发言时说，他将不承认国际筹备委员会所发表的声明。他责难国际筹备委员会没有邀请新加坡和曼谷等地的代表。但是，他立刻又说，他的发言不是代表他的代表团发表的，他谈的只是他个人的意见。
    这时，新加坡代表要求发言。他对德维加的发言进行了驳斥，他说，新加坡学生代表实际上是包括在马来亚的学生代表团之内的。
    巴基斯坦学生代表艾哈迈德·纳维在发言中强调寻求共同点的重要性，同时，他要求会议不要讨论那些可能引起分歧和不和的政治性问题。他认为，讨论和决定政治问题是政治家的事情。
    老挝代表也在会上发言说，我们到这里来不是为政治见解辩护的。我们到这里来是为了谋求协议和为共同行动的计划打下基础。他希望会议可能产生友爱和和平精神。
    日本学生代表说，我们不应当忘记在今天在殖民主义统治下被迫过着痛苦生活的人们。他追述在上次世界大战中所遭到的损害。他说，我们将同所有国家的学生一起对一切形式的殖民主义进行斗争，同时将坚决地向那些在殖民主义统治下英勇地进行斗争的学生伸出我们支援的臂膀。
    最后，日本学生代表建议会议讨论四点，包括增进各国学生之间的相互谅解和友谊，要求禁止生产和试验原子武器，保卫和平和防止另一次战争。
    叙利亚学生代表在发言一开头就指责殖民主义。他指出，我们所谈的关于殖民主义化的话不仅是政治问题。这是关系到促进学习的问题，这是关系到我们在殖民压迫下的学生，或者更恰当地说在帝国主义的轨道里的学生的根本生存的问题。在政权操在外国人手里的国家里，是不可能谈发展教育的问题的。不谈殖民主义化——文化和传播知识的第一号敌人，是不可能谈促进文化的。
    他着重指出，历史从来没有记载在殖民地国家里教育有任何进展。相反的，殖民主义者扼杀民族文化，歪曲教育。他们阻碍文化和传播知识的任何进展。
    苏丹学生首席代表达法拉·哈格·优素福今天上午在全体会议上发言时着重指出了要求和平和友好的普遍愿望。
    据新华社万隆5日电　亚非学生会议在六月四日下午继续举行全体会议。
    会上第一个发言的是伊朗代表雅瓦德·瓦法。他说，殖民主义不是亚洲人和非洲人面临的唯一问题，也不是“许多人在将来一些时候要继续面临的”唯一问题。这位直接从美国来的伊朗代表告诉学生代表不要谈论政治，不然他们就会丧失增长自己的知识的时间。
    摩洛哥代表告诉代表们说，在今年三月，法国统治者终于让他的国家独立了。但是他说，这个胜利并不完全。
    他说，由于法国殖民主义化的结果，他的国家的人民90％以上是文盲。他说，
  “殖民主义使我们完全隔离开来，使我们不能同我们国家以外的其他地方的学生接触；今年，我们终于自由了，因此能够同许多学生接触，我们希望由于这次会议，我们之间将建立起巩固和友好的联系。”他希望第二次亚非学生会议和地区性的学生会议将被认为是加强学生之间友好关系的方法。他说：“对我们所有人说来，和平事实上是迫切需要的。”他认为每一个学生都应该在他自己国家内宣传和平。
    在会上发言的还有约旦、喀麦隆、马达加斯加、中国和马来亚的代表。（中国代表团团长钱李仁的发言见第四版）
    经过短时间的休会以后，会议在晚间十一时复会。在会上发言的有尼泊尔、印度、多哥、越南北部和西非的代表。
    尼泊尔代表贾迪什·杰哈说：“我们尼泊尔学生欢迎国际筹备委员会不论政治见解，动员学生运动的各种不同力量从而为自由和平和进步的共同高涨准备条件这一行动。”
    越南学生代表团团长李光荃发言说：越南民主共和国的学生很希望和其他国家的学生合作，和他们进行友好交往。他们都希望这次会议将会使他们看到亚洲和非洲的学生在教育、文化、体育交流和旅行来往方面建立更广泛的合作的愿望得以实现。他们还希望这次会议将积极地有助于使所有亚洲和非洲的学生能够在和平和独立的祖国进行学习。
    李光荃在发言中介绍了越南北部的学生在和平实现以后学习条件的改善和教育事业的发展，他说，越南的北方已经在进行发展民族文化和同外国进行文化交流的工作。同其他国家的学生友好合作一向是越南学生活动中的指导原则。
    李光荃说，现在，我们的国家恢复了和平，大多数亚非国家获得了它们的民族主权。在去年的万隆会议以后，这些国家的学生之间的关系也加强了。这一切使我们深切地认识到这样一个事实：没有和平和民族独立，我们的学习就不能有任何改进，我们的民族文化就不能有任何发展，我们各国的学生就不能有任何友好来往。因此，我们认为，不应该把和平和民族独立仅仅看成纯粹是政治问题，而且还要把它们看成是发展我们的学习、我们的民族文化和学生之间的友好合作的必要背景。因此，和平和民族独立在越南学生看来是十分珍贵的。因此，我们支持旨在巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势的一切活动。
