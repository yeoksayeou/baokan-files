Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, 8th: The Asian-African Students Conference President Augustine announced at 8:40 pm on June 7th, "The Asian-African Students Conference has now successfully concluded." At that moment, student representatives from various countries burst into thunderous applause, shouting "Independence," the sound waves reverberating throughout Bandung's "Cultural Building."

The closing meeting began at 4 pm, presided over by Chairman Augustine. The Chairman of the General Affairs Committee, Salah Shahawi, head of the Egyptian student delegation, gave a brief report on the work of the General Affairs Committee. Subsequently, the secretariat of the presidium read out the draft of the Asian-African Students Conference's "Final Communiqué," drafted according to the recommendations of the conference's five committees.

The meeting adjourned twice to allow the General Affairs Committee to discuss and decide on the wording of certain parts of the Final Communiqué, as representatives had proposed some amendments. The preamble and the first four sections of the Final Communiqué were first approved by oral vote after discussion.

Regarding the use of atomic energy mentioned in the fifth section of the Final Communiqué, the Japanese student delegation suggested the following wording: "We demand an immediate halt to the testing of nuclear weapons in all parts of the world." This suggestion was warmly welcomed by the participants.

The Malayan student delegation requested that the conference should also express support for the struggle of the Malayan people. The spokesperson of the General Affairs Committee, Sabarwal, head of the Indian student delegation, explained that Asian-African students would also support the struggle of the Malayan people. He said that Malaya was not mentioned in the fifth section of the Final Communiqué because the conference wished to emphasize its support for the people of Algeria and the people in other places in the world where bloody suppression is happening every day. This explanation was agreed to by the Malayan student delegation.

When the entire Final Communiqué was unanimously adopted, the cheering and applause lasted for more than ten minutes. The student representatives shouted "Independence" and hoisted the chief representatives of Algeria and Malaya aloft.

Abdul Akil of the Syrian student delegation proposed that the conference pass a resolution to express gratitude to the Indonesian students and government for their hospitality and assistance to the conference. All the representatives warmly applauded and passed this motion.

More than 100 student representatives from Afghanistan, Algeria, Burma, Ceylon, the People's Republic of China, Egypt, Iran, India, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, Cameroon, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos, Lebanon, Madagascar, Malaya, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Togo, Tunisia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and West Africa participated in the closing meeting. The Philippine representatives did not attend, having voluntarily withdrawn from the meeting on June 5th.

Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, 8th: The National Preparatory Committee of Indonesia for the Asian-African Students Conference organized a grand friendly gathering at the Homann Savoy Hotel on the evening of June 7th to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Asian-African Students Conference. Student representatives from various countries, local Indonesian officials, and students, totaling about 1,000 people, attended. At the invitation of the hosts, student representatives from various countries will travel to Yogyakarta on the morning of June 8th, where they will visit and tour Yogyakarta and other places.

    亚非学生会议圆满结束
    据新华社万隆8日电　六月七日晚上八点四十分，亚非学生会议主席奥古斯丁在会上宣布：“亚非学生会议现在已经圆满结束”。这时，各国学生代表们发出了暴风雨般的掌声，高呼“独立”，声浪响彻了万隆的“文化大厦”。
    闭幕会议是在下午四点在主席奥古斯丁主持下开始举行的。总务委员会主席、埃及学生代表团团长萨拉·沙哈维在会上作了关于总务委员会工作的简短报告。接着主席团秘书宣读了根据会议的五个委员会的建议草拟的亚非学生会议“最后公报”的草稿。
    会议曾经两次休会以便总务委员会讨论和决定最后公报某些部分的措词，因为代表们提出了一些修改。最后公报的序言和前四个部分在讨论后首先分别以口头表决通过。
    关于最后公报第五部分中所提到的使用原子能问题，日本学生代表团建议用这样的字句：“我们要求在世界一切地方立即停止核子武器的试验。”这个建议得到与会者的热烈欢迎。
    马来亚学生代表团要求，会议也应该对马来亚人民的斗争表示支持。总务委员会发言人、印度学生代表团团长萨巴尔瓦尔解释说，亚非学生也将支持马来亚人民的斗争。他说，在最后公报的第五部分没有提到马来亚，这是因为会议希望着重指出它支持阿尔及利亚的人民以及世界上其他的每天都在发生流血镇压的地方的人民的斗争。这种解释得到了马来亚学生代表团的同意。
    当全部最后公报被一致通过的时候，欢呼和鼓掌历时十分钟以上。学生代表们高呼“独立”，并且把阿尔及利亚和马来亚的首席代表高举起来。
    叙利亚学生代表团的阿卜杜勒·阿基尔提议会议通过决议，对印度尼西亚学生和政府的殷勤招待和给予会议的协助表示感谢。全体代表热烈鼓掌通过了这个动议。
    参加闭幕会议的有阿富汗、阿尔及利亚、缅甸、锡兰、中华人民共和国、埃及、伊朗、印度、印度尼西亚、日本、约旦、喀麦隆、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、老挝、黎巴嫩、马达加斯加、马来亚、摩洛哥、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、苏丹、叙利亚、多哥、突尼斯、越南民主共和国和西非等的学生代表一百多人。菲律宾代表没有出席，他们在六月五日自动退出了会议。
    据新华社万隆8日电　亚非学生会议印度尼西亚全国筹备委员会六月七日晚上在霍曼·萨伏伊旅馆组织了盛大的友好集会，庆祝亚非学生会议胜利结束。到会的有各国学生代表、当地的印度尼西亚官员和学生共约一千人。各国学生代表应主人的邀请，六月八日上午前往日惹，他们将在日惹和其他地方参观访问。
