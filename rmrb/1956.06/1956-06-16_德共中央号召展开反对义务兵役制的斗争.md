Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 14th. The Central Committee of the German Communist Party, at a recent plenary session, adopted an appeal to the people of West Germany, all political parties and organizations, and the Federal Parliament, calling for a struggle against the implementation of conscription and for a referendum on the issue.

The German Communist Party pointed out that at a time when the international situation is easing and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are already carrying out disarmament, the West German government's plan to establish an army of 500,000 men is unacceptable. The Federal Parliament should remove the universal conscription bill from its agenda and pass a law on holding a referendum.

The German Communist Party suggested that the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic conclude an agreement guaranteeing that neither side will implement conscription.

The German Communist Party urged the working people to rise up to defend their vital interests and the future of all German people, and to take active measures to prevent the implementation of universal conscription and strive for an agreement between Germans.

    德共中央号召展开反对义务兵役制的斗争
    新华社柏林14日电　德国共产党中央委员会在最近举行的一次全体会议上通过了一项致西德人民、各政党和团体以及联邦议院的呼吁书，号召为反对实行义务兵役制和争取就这个问题举行全民投票而斗争。
    德国共产党指出：在国际形势日见缓和而且苏联和其他社会主义国家已经在进行裁军的时候，西德政府还打算建立一支拥有五十万人的军队的作法是不能容许的。联邦议院应该从它的议程上取消普遍兵役法案，而通过一项关于举行全民投票的法律。
    德国共产党建议联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国缔结协定，保证双方不实行征兵。
    德国共产党敦促劳动人民起来保卫他们的切身利益和全体德国人民的未来，并且以积极的措施阻止实行普遍兵役，争取德国人之间的协议。
