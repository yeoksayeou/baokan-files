    Xiangtan Special District Farmers Actively Extinguish Insect Pests
    ZaoYang County Uses Indigenous Medicines and Methods to Control Insect Pests
    (Reported by this newspaper) Recently, nearly 60,000 people in seven counties, including Chaling, Youxian, and Changsha in Xiangtan Special District, Hunan Province, have been mobilized to basically eliminate insect pests from more than 160,000 mu of fields using various methods.
    When preventing and controlling insect pests, in addition to using pesticides and machinery, all localities have paid special attention to mobilizing the masses to extinguish insect pests through methods such as attracting insects with lights, inserting straw bundles in the fields, and using rice water or insect nets to capture pests, with great success. In Liling County, 508 agricultural cooperatives used nearly 2,000 sprayers and "666" pesticide powder to kill insects, and also mobilized more than 10,000 farmers to use rice water and insect nets to capture insects in the early morning when dew was present and insects could not fly. The tea farmers' cooperative in Wantang Township inserted many straw bundles in the fields every day, burning many egg masses to death.
    (Reported by this newspaper from Wuhan) Agricultural production cooperatives in ZaoYang County, Hubei Province, are actively using local indigenous medicines and methods to prevent and control aphids and red spiders. At present, more than 300,000 mu of cotton fields have been treated throughout the county, of which 85% to 90% are treated with indigenous medicines and methods. In the cotton fields that have been treated, the cotton seedlings that were originally damaged by insects have begun to grow new leaves.

    湘潭专区农民积极扑灭虫害
    枣阳县用土药土方防治害虫
    本报讯　湖南省湘潭专区茶陵、攸县、长沙等七个县最近出动近六万人，采用各种办法，基本消灭了十六万多亩田的虫害。
    各地在防治虫害时，除采用药械灭虫外，还特别注意发动群众，采用点灯诱虫，田中插草把、用米汤或捕虫网捕捉害虫等办法扑灭虫害收效很大。醴陵县508个农业社用近二千个喷雾器和“六六六”药粉杀虫，还发动了一万多个农民，在早晨有露水虫飞不起时，用米汤浇和用捕虫网捕捉。湾塘乡茶农社每天在田中插了许多个草把，烧死了不少卵块。
    本报武汉讯　湖北省枣阳县各地农业生产合作社正在采用当地的土药土方积极防治蚜虫和红蜘蛛。目前，全县经过防治的棉田有三十多万亩，其中有85％到90％是用土药土方防治的。经过防治以后的棉田中，原来被虫咬坏的棉苗，已经开始长出嫩叶。
