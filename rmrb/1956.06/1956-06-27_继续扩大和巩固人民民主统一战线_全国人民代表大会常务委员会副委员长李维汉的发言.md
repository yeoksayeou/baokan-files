    Continue to Expand and Consolidate the People's Democratic United Front
    --Speech by Li Weihan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
    I would like to express some opinions on the united front work.
      The People's Democratic United Front
      Has Played Its Due Role
      Currently, we are in the midst of a high tide of socialist revolution and socialist
  construction. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce by the state has achieved a decisive victory. Socialist industrialization has also made significant achievements, fundamentally changing the urban and rural relations of production and the political situation in our country. This is the result of the hard work of people of all nationalities across the country on all fronts for more than six years, and it is inseparable from the role of the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party. Without the correct united front policy and the basically correct implementation of this policy, uniting and mobilizing all positive forces and overcoming negative factors, it would be difficult to imagine achieving such rapid and significant achievements in socialist transformation, especially in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, as we have today.
    Now, the general task of the state's transition period has not yet been completed. It will take several more years to basically complete the socialist revolution nationwide, and it will take even longer to basically realize the country's socialist industrialization. The task of fighting against domestic and foreign enemies has not been reduced, and the struggle to achieve the peaceful liberation of Taiwan must continue. In the movement to defend world peace, China's people's democratic united front will continue to play its role. Therefore, our task in the future is to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, unite all forces that can be united, and strive for common goals. As Chairman Mao has clearly pointed out, "The people of our country should have a long-term plan to strive to change our country's economic, scientific, and cultural backwardness within a few decades and quickly reach the advanced level in the world. To achieve this great goal, the decisive factor is to have cadres, to have a sufficient number of excellent scientific and technological experts; at the same time, it is necessary to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front and unite all forces that can be united. The people of our country must also unite with the people of all countries in the world and strive to safeguard world peace." (Speech at the Supreme State Conference on January 25, 1956)
    The Political Outlook and
    Internal Relations of the United Front Have Undergone Fundamental Changes
    Over the past six years, with the changes in domestic class relations, especially the fundamental changes in urban and rural relations of production after the high tide of socialist revolution, the political outlook and internal relations of the people's democratic united front have also undergone fundamental changes: (1) The foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship—the worker-peasant alliance—has been advanced to a new, that is, socialist basis, becoming an unbreakable alliance. (2) The face of the intellectual community has undergone fundamental changes. The vast majority of intellectuals are already state workers. From their social status, they have long been part of the working class, and their political stance is now increasingly shifting to the working class's stance. (3) The majority of capitalists and capitalist agents have begun to become public officials in joint state-private enterprises and some state-owned enterprises. Their relationship with workers has begun to change from the labor-capital opposition under the capitalist system to the relationship of working together under the socialist system.
  (4) All ethnic minorities are advancing under different conditions, and most ethnic minorities have embarked on the road to socialist transition one after another. (5) All democratic parties have accepted socialism and have adopted a political line of serving socialism. These changes reflect the expansion and enhancement of socialist unity in the political and ideological aspects of the broad masses of people in our country, reflecting the greater consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front, and creating extremely favorable conditions for continuing to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front.
  Class Contradictions and Class Struggle Still Exist
    Within the United Front
    Class contradictions and class struggle still exist within the people's democratic united front. This is primarily because socialist transformation has not yet been completed, capitalist ownership has not been completely changed, and the bourgeoisie as a class has not been eliminated. Furthermore, the various divisions and changes in politics and ideology within the ranks of intellectuals, as well as the self-education and self-transformation of intellectuals, are also a reflection of class contradictions. Class contradictions and class struggle within the people's democratic united front will continue to manifest in political, economic, cultural, and ideological aspects. At the same time, because the vast majority of intellectuals are already state working cadres, and the majority of bourgeois elements have also begun to become public officials in joint and state-owned enterprises, future class contradictions and class struggle will be reflected more from the business, work, and academic research of organs, schools, and enterprises, manifested as different positions, viewpoints, and methods for observing and handling problems, and different thoughts and styles. That is to say, the manifestations of class contradictions and class struggle within the people's democratic united front have also undergone certain changes following the changes in class relations.
  Persuasion and Education Have Become the Main Method for Handling Class Contradictions
  and Class Struggle
    Within the people's democratic united front, due to the continued existence of class contradictions and class struggle, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of both unity and struggle in accordance with socialist goals and principles. Struggle is for unity, for enhancing socialist consistency. On the other hand, due to the new changes in class relations and the manifestations of class contradictions and class struggle, it will be more beneficial in the future to use the method of persuasion and education as the main method when dealing with class contradictions and class struggle. The so-called method of persuasion and education is the method of reasoning, the method of competition, the method of criticism and self-criticism, and the method of both encouragement and criticism. Since persuasion and education have become the main methods for handling class contradictions and class struggle, education and learning have become the central task in the united front work. Education and learning are mainly carried out in two aspects, namely, learning from work and business practices on the one hand, and conducting political and theoretical learning on the other hand. Coordinating and combining these two aspects of learning, appropriately participate in the observation and practice of social life.
    The purpose of education and learning, for intellectuals, is to help them continue to carry out self-transformation, gradually making their thinking compatible with their changing and changing social status; for bourgeois elements, it is to help them prepare ideologically for the final change in capitalist ownership and to gradually transform themselves into laborers in the true sense of the word.
      In order to meet the requirements of democratic figures and industrialists and businessmen from all walks of life for political learning and theoretical learning, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference issued the "Decision on Organizing Political Learning and Theoretical Learning for Democratic Figures and Industrialists and Businessmen from All Walks of Life" on March 27, 1956. The teaching principles contained in the decision are: (1) Whether to participate in learning must follow the principle of voluntariness; (2) the teaching method of free thinking and free debate must be implemented; (3) no investigation of history, no investigation of thought; (4) in terms of learning conditions, non-Party members and Communist Party members are treated equally. This decision is being implemented in various places. To make this decision a complete success, the responsible comrades of each province, city, and autonomous region must pay attention to leading and helping.
  Correctly Handle the Relationship of Cooperation and Working Together Within Organs, Schools, and Enterprises
    Correctly handling the relationship of cooperation and working together within organs, schools, and enterprises is an important key to helping people carry out self-education and consolidate the people's democratic united front. Due to the leading position of the Communist Party of China in national life, the relationship of cooperation and working together within organs, schools, and enterprises is mainly the relationship between Communist Party members and non-Party members. Communist Party members here should take a proactive attitude and assume the main responsibility. At the same time, non-Party members also have their own responsibilities. At present, there are two types of cooperative relationships. One is the working relationship between Communist Party members and general non-Party members in organs, schools, and state-owned enterprises, and here, it is mainly the working relationship with non-Party intellectuals. This working relationship has a history of several years. Since the vast majority of intellectuals in this area are already part of the working class, the relationship in this area has basically become a relationship within the working class. Therefore, in general, Communist Party members in this area should establish a socialist relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation with non-Party members; contradictions and differences between each other should also be handled with a comrade-like attitude. This relationship has made progress in recent years, and after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the meeting on intellectuals' issues, there have been many improvements in various aspects. However, there are still many problems. The main aspect of the problem is that Communist Party members must fully trust non-Party members, ensure that they have duties and powers, and help them fulfill their duties and responsibilities. This requires division of responsibilities, so that non-Party members have full work to do, have the conditions to do things, and receive the necessary support and assistance; it is necessary to consult with non-Party members on how to do things, and give non-Party members the opportunity to fully express their opinions, and be open and honest with each other to communicate thoughts. In order to further improve the working relationship in this area, in addition to clarifying ideological issues, it is also necessary to improve the work system.
    The other is the relationship of working together between employees and Communist Party members and bourgeois elements in joint state-private enterprises and some state-owned enterprises. This relationship was mostly established during the high tide of socialist transformation and is a new relationship. The establishment of this relationship reflects the fundamental change in the original capitalist relations of production in the enterprise, and reflects the gradual transition of bourgeois elements towards laborers. However, this change has not yet been completed; this transition, for most people, has only just begun to take the first step. Therefore, this working relationship is also a class relationship. Correctly handling this relationship has important political significance. Employees, Communist Party members, and capitalist personnel in enterprises should have a common understanding that enterprises are the main base for further uniting, educating, and transforming capitalist personnel. For capitalist personnel who have been engaged in industry and commerce for a long time, continuing to work and study in enterprises and gradually transforming themselves into laborers in the true sense of the word is the most convenient way for them.
    Capitalist personnel belong to the national bourgeoisie, and they are different from bureaucratic capitalist elements. In terms of management, science and technology, or production skills, most people have certain abilities and experience. After several years of education, capitalist personnel have universally raised their awareness, and a large number of activists who accept socialist transformation and a considerable number of progressive core elements have gradually increased; after the high tide of socialist transformation arrived, this trend of activists developing from a minority to a majority, and the number of progressive core elements is also increasing day by day. That is to say, the vast majority of capitalist personnel are already positive factors in our country, and after necessary education and transformation, they can become important positive factors participating in the socialist cause. These situations are the political foundation and favorable conditions for establishing and developing cooperative relations with capitalist personnel in enterprises.
    However, in order to consolidate this cooperative relationship, we must also point out the other aspect of the situation with a frank attitude. Because capitalist personnel have long directly exploited and oppressed workers, they have accumulated class resentment among the working masses. After liberation, many capitalist personnel once wantonly engaged in the "five evils" and launched a frenzied attack on the working class. As everyone knows, due to this frenzied attack, the Communist Party and the People's Government led the working class in carrying out the historically significant "Five-Anti" struggle, which educated not only the working masses and state workers, but also the bourgeois elements. It is precisely because most bourgeois elements recognized the harm of the five evils to the motherland and the people in this struggle, and realized the necessity of accepting the leadership of the working class and embarking on the socialist road, that the socialist transformation today is possible to take a more moderate form. Of course, even after the Five-Anti campaign, and even for a period after the enterprise was merged, most capitalist personnel's capitalist traditions and habits in management methods have not been completely changed in thought and practice, which cannot but bring some negative factors to the enterprise that are unfavorable to socialism. These situations are the difficulties and unfavorable conditions for establishing and developing cooperation in this area.
  The Public Share Representatives of Enterprises Should Assume the Responsibility of Actively Uniting and Educating Capitalist Personnel
    From this, it can be understood that to properly establish and develop this cooperative relationship, a lot of work is required, and considerable long-term efforts are required to gradually advance. On the one hand, the employees of the enterprise, first of all, the public share representatives and Communist Party members, must fully recognize and estimate the active role of capitalist personnel and the possibility of gradually transforming into laborers. According to the policies of the Party and the People's Government, according to the great spirit of the working class liberating all mankind, they should assume the responsibility of actively uniting and educating capitalist personnel, encouraging and helping them to play an active role that is conducive to production and management, and continue to carry out self-transformation. To this end, their positions and work should be appropriately arranged according to the policy of "using talents according to their abilities and giving appropriate consideration"; their representatives should be absorbed into democratic management institutions, and they should have the duties and powers for the matters for which they are responsible; they should be absorbed into the reorganization and reform of enterprises, and participate in socialist competitions. They should be given due trust in their work, give full play to their strengths, and help them achieve results; they should consult with them on how to do things, and seriously consider their opinions and criticisms. Appropriate systems should be stipulated to enable capitalist personnel to participate in administrative business meetings that they should participate in and read relevant administrative business documents. Their achievements and positive roles should be rewarded and commended equally, and their shortcomings and mistakes should be treated with a kind attitude, helping them to recognize and correct them. In these tasks, public share representatives and Communist Party members should pay attention to winning the help of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association, and should give capitalist personnel the necessary time to participate in political and business studies, participate in the activities of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association, and other social life practices. It is very difficult for public share representatives and Communist Party members in enterprises to do these tasks well. Most of them are cooperating with capitalist personnel for the first time, and their knowledge of policies is not enough, and they lack practical experience. In addition, there are too few specific systems, and the views of those above, below, left, and right are not always consistent, and their relationship with capitalist personnel is not only a working relationship, but also a class relationship. Therefore, they feel that this is a difficult task, and they have many concerns in their hearts. We request that all relevant Party organizations and government leadership departments, through various effective measures, give timely guidance to the public share representatives and Communist Party members in enterprises in terms of ideology, organization, and practical work, and give them full support and help, so that they have the confidence and the means to do this work well.
  Capitalist Personnel Should Actively Participate in Production
  and Operation; Strive to Carry Out Self-Transformation
    On the other hand, we hope that capitalist personnel will deeply realize: In cooperation in enterprises, it is necessary to give full play to their active role, strive to participate in production and operation, and make achievements; it is also necessary to strive to carry out self-transformation, break the capitalist set in ideological understanding and work practice, establish a socialist set, and strive to gradually become laborers in the true sense of the word from capitalist personnel, so that their relationship with employees will change from a dualistic working relationship to a completely socialist cooperative and mutual assistance relationship. The self-transformation of capitalist personnel is still an important and arduous task, and it is wrong to underestimate or ignore the importance and arduousness of this task. Therefore, in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, in addition to the active efforts of public share representatives and Communist Party members, capitalist personnel also need to take the initiative and sincerely approach public personnel and Communist Party members in work and study, and strive for their help and support; they need to take the initiative to approach the working masses, and when necessary, take the initiative to make appropriate self-criticism to the working masses, and rely more on their honest actions to change the working masses' views. Capitalist personnel need to learn from the working masses; to transform themselves into the working people, they must first learn from the working people—we hope that capitalist personnel can understand this truth. If capitalist personnel can adopt this positive, proactive, and true and sincere attitude, it will create certain conditions that are conducive to overcoming certain negative and difficult factors in the above-mentioned cooperative relationship, so that the relationship in this area can be established and developed more normally. Of course, as has been repeatedly pointed out above, in establishing and developing this relationship, public share representatives and Communist Party members bear more responsibility and need to do more work, there is no doubt about this.
    Communist Party Members Should Enthusiastically Help
    Non-Party Members, and Humbly Learn From
        Non-Party Members
    Here, it is also important to point out that in the above-mentioned two types of cooperative relationships, Communist Party members must not only enthusiastically help non-Party members to do their work well and carry out self-education, but also humbly learn from the strengths of non-Party members, especially intellectuals and capitalist personnel. Communist Party members "should learn from those who have specialized knowledge (specialists) and those who have experience in adjusting the large economy (capitalists)," "Smart Communist Party members are not afraid to learn from capitalists" (Lenin). We Communist Party members must admit that there are many, many things that we do not understand but non-Party members understand. For all the useful knowledge and experience that non-Party members have but we lack, we must have a determination and a humble attitude to learn from them through various appropriate forms. By doing this, we are also conducive to improving and consolidating our cooperation with non-Party members and capitalist personnel.
    We Should Promote the Policy of Long-Term Coexistence
      and Mutual Supervision
    All democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic figures from all walks of life, the People's Political Consultative Conference have played their due role in the struggle to consolidate and expand the united front, and will need to play a greater role in the future. Here, I would only like to offer some opinions on the work of the democratic parties. Years of experience have proven that democratic parties not only play an important role in uniting and mobilizing all positive forces, but also play an important role in mutual supervision. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, first and foremost, the supervision of the Communist Party. This is a major policy, and the proposal of this policy is at the same time another declaration that implementing democratic cooperation with non-Party members is a "fixed" and "forever unchanged" principle of the Communist Party. Some people say, "There are people in the Communist Party who do not value the democratic parties, and there are also people in the democratic parties who do not value the democratic parties." I think this is not only a matter of the views of some people, but also a reflection of a social phenomenon. We should promote the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. This can not only help people clarify their doubts about the political role and historical position of the democratic parties, but also encourage the members of the democratic parties to engage in more activities that benefit the people. On the one hand, if the understanding and estimation are clarified, and on the other hand, if more beneficial things are done, people's perceptions will further change, the opinions of the democratic parties will be more valued by all parties, and their work and activities will be more supported by all parties. In recent years, all democratic parties have made great progress and achievements. After the high tide of the socialist revolution arrived, they successively convened congresses or central meetings to discuss and decide on the guidelines for their respective organizations and work. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China agrees with their guidelines, and the relevant organizations and members of the Communist Party of China will continue to give friendly support and help to the work of the democratic parties.
  Shortcomings and Problems of Some Communist Party Members
    At present, there are many problems in united front work. Some problems have arisen with the fundamental changes in China's political situation, and they are a reflection of new things and new contradictions. Some problems reflect the contradictions between old and new things, and those methods and regulations that were very applicable in the past but now need to be changed fall into this category. There are also some problems that do reflect the shortcomings and problems in our work. We need to study and deal with all aspects of the problems separately and gradually. Here, I would only like to talk about the shortcomings and problems of some Communist Party members. For example, in working relationships, they do not respect the powers of non-Party members (including capitalist personnel), do not support them in exercising their powers, but act arbitrarily and exclude others; they are unwilling to consult with non-Party members, do not allow different opinions and opposing opinions, but impose their own will on others, let alone learn from the strengths of others. Comrades with these shortcomings and problems still retain a narrow closed-doorism or sectarianism style. They do not yet understand what Chairman Mao instructed, "National affairs are national public affairs, not private affairs of one party or one faction. Therefore, Communist Party members only have the obligation to implement democratic cooperation with non-Party members, but no right to exclude others and monopolize everything." "Communist Party members should implement democratic cooperation with non-Party members, and must not go their own way and monopolize everything." "Communist Party members must listen to the opinions of non-Party members and give others the opportunity to speak. We should welcome what others say is correct, and learn from the strengths of others; even if what others say is incorrect, we should let others finish speaking, and then slowly explain it. Communist Party members must never be conceited and arrogant, thinking that they are good at everything and others are not good at anything; they must never lock themselves in a small house, boasting and bragging, and calling themselves kings and hegemons." Some comrades do not give enough respect to the rights of democratic parties and some people's organizations, and they do not yet understand that all democratic parties and people's organizations are in an equal position in law. China's democratic parties and people's organizations have a tradition of mutual consultation, mutual assistance, and mutual supervision in politics, and we should continue to carry forward this tradition. In order to carry forward this tradition, it is necessary to strictly respect the political freedom and organizational independence of all democratic parties and people's organizations within the scope of the rights and obligations granted by the Constitution, and no party or organization has the right to interfere with this freedom and independence of other parties and organizations. Some comrades welcome progressives, but are not very welcoming to people in the middle and backward state, and even keep a respectful distance from them. They do not yet understand that our Party's policy is that, except for counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements, Communist Party members should enthusiastically implement democratic cooperation with all non-Party members; from the perspective of the united front work with the middle and upper strata, Communist Party members should work with progressives to conduct more work with people in the middle and backward state. Some comrades underestimate the progress of non-Party members. In their relationship with non-Party members, they only pay attention to the difference, and ignore the commonality and the gradually increasing commonality. Therefore, they lack the enthusiasm for mutual assistance and mutual learning in accordance with socialist principles; in many places where they should be treated equally, they have adopted discriminatory treatment methods. Some comrades lack sufficient understanding of the necessity and long-term nature of cooperation with democratic parties and non-Party members, so they often waver in the united front work, especially during the great waves of mass revolutionary struggle. These comrades do not yet understand the following truth: The proletariat can only completely liberate itself by liberating all mankind; they do not yet understand what Chairman Mao instructed, "The Communist Party's principle of implementing democratic cooperation with non-Party members is fixed and will never change. As long as there are parties in society, the number of people who join the Party is always a minority, and the number of people outside the Party is always a majority, so Party members always have to cooperate with people outside the Party." There are also some comrades who do not make serious distinctions on the issue of the enemy and us, on important principled differences, and do not sincerely and frankly distinguish between right and wrong, but adopt a vulgar liberal attitude. The above-mentioned are relatively serious shortcomings and problems. Of course, only individual comrades have all of these shortcomings and problems, but there are indeed some comrades, including some comrades in united front work departments, who have one or more of the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems. These shortcomings and problems are not simply due to personal reasons, but are also a reflection of a social phenomenon, which requires us to repeatedly carry out publicity and education, but we have not done enough.
  Comprehensively Inspect the United Front Work Once
    In order to adapt to the fundamental changes in China's political situation, in February of this year, the Communist Party held the Fifth National United Front Work Conference to discuss the tasks and policies of united front work, and decided to comprehensively inspect the united front work once (including ethnic work and work and problems not mentioned in this speech). We have already started this inspection. Because the united front work is a matter that everyone has a share in and everyone cares about, and in order to give full play to the role of supervision and pool ideas, we have invited democratic parties and democratic figures to jointly conduct the inspection, and we welcome friends from all walks of life to expose and criticize the shortcomings and problems of Communist Party members, especially the united front work departments. We must not only expose shortcomings and problems and correct them; we must also discover and promote advanced experience, and discover and solve new problems. We must not only communicate ideas and clarify policies; we must also find some appropriate measures in practical work and systems. In order to further improve relations, enhance unity, in order to mobilize positive factors and overcome negative factors, in short, in order to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, this is the purpose of our inspection of the united front work. I believe that through the joint efforts of all parties, we can achieve this goal.
    My speech only talked about a few aspects of the united front work, and there are some work and problems that have not been mentioned, not because those work and problems are not important, but because it is impossible to talk about them all at once. Please criticize and correct the content of my speech.

    继续扩大和巩固人民民主统一战线
    ——全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李维汉的发言
    我现在就统一战线工作发表一点意见。
      人民民主统一战线
      发挥了应有的作用
      目前，我们正处在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高潮之中。国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造都
  已经取得了决定性的胜利，社会主义工业化也获得了重大的成就，使我们国家的城乡生产关系和政治形势起了根本的变化。这是六年多来全国各民族人民在各个战线上努力奋斗的结果，也是同以共产党为首的人民民主统一战线的作用分不开的。我国人民民主统一战线，在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，已经发挥了它应有的作用。如果没有正确的统一战线政策和基本上正确地执行了这个政策，团结和动员了一切积极力量，克服了消极因素，要在社会主义改造尤其是资本主义工商业改造方面，取得像今天这样又快又大的成就，是很难设想的。
    现在，国家过渡时期的总任务还没有完成，要在全国范围内基本上完成社会主义革命还需要几年的时间，基本上实现国家的社会主义工业化还要有更长的时间，反对内外敌人的斗争任务也没有减轻，争取和平解放台湾的斗争还要继续努力。在保卫世界和平的运动中，我国的人民民主统一战线还要继续发挥它的作用。因此，我们今后的任务是要继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量，为共同的目标奋斗。如同毛主席已经明确指出的，“我国人民应该有一个远大的规划，要在几十年内，努力改变我国在经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界上的先进水平。为了实现这个伟大的目标，决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家；同时，要继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量。我国人民还要同世界各国人民团结一起，为维护世界的和平而奋斗。”（在1956年1月25日最高国务会议上的讲话）
    统一战线的政治面貌和
    内部关系发生了根本变化
    六年多来，随着国内阶级关系的变化，特别是社会主义革命高潮来到以后城乡生产关系的根本变化，人民民主统一战线的政治面貌和内部关系也发生了根本变化：（1）人民民主专政的基础——工农联盟已推进到新的即社会主义的基础上，成为牢不可破的联盟。（2）知识界的面貌已经发生了根本的变化，知识分子的绝大多数已经是国家的工作人员，从他们的社会地位说来，他们早已是工人阶级的一部分，他们的政治立场现在也日益转到工人阶级的立场上来。（3）大多数资本家和资本家代理人开始成为公私合营企业和一部分国营企业的公职人员，他们同职工之间的关系，从资本主义制度下的劳资对立开始改变为社会主义制度下的共同工作的关系。
  （4）各少数民族都在不同的条件下前进，大多数的少数民族已经先后走上了向着社会主义过渡的道路。（5）各民主党派已经接受社会主义，并且采取了为社会主义服务的政治路线。这些变化，反映了我国广大人民在政治上，思想上社会主义一致性的扩大和增强，反映了人民民主统一战线的更加巩固和扩大，并且为继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线创造了极为有利的条件。
  统一战线内部仍然存在着
    阶级矛盾和阶级斗争
    人民民主统一战线内部，仍然存在着阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。这首先是因为社会主义改造还没有完成，资本主义所有制还没有完全改变，资产阶级作为阶级还没有消灭。再则，知识分子队伍中的政治上和思想上的各种分野和变化，知识分子的自我教育和自我改造，也是阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的一种反映。人民民主统一战线内部的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，将继续从政治、经济、文化和思想等各个方面表现出来。同时，因为知识分子的绝大部分早已是国家的工作干部，而资产阶级分子的大多数也开始成为合营和国营企业的公职人员，今后的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争将要更多地从机关、学校和企业的业务、工作和学术研究上反映出来，表现为观察和处理问题的不同的立场、观点和方法，不同的思想和作风。这就是说，人民民主统一战线内部阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的表现形式，也跟着阶级关系的变化而发生了一定情况的变化。
  说服教育成了处理阶级矛
  盾和阶级斗争的主要方法
    在人民民主统一战线内部，由于阶级矛盾和阶级斗争继续存在，就需要按照社会主义的目标和原则，继续执行又团结又斗争的政策，斗争是为了团结，为了增强社会主义的一致性。另一方面，又由于阶级关系以及阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的表现形式都发生了新的变化，今后在处理阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的时候，就更有利于使用说服教育的方法，把它作为主要的方法。所谓说服教育的方法，就是讲道理的方法，竞赛的方法，批评、自我批评和又鼓励又批评的方法。说服教育既然成了处理阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的主要方法，教育和学习由此也就成了统一战线工作中的中心工作。主要从两个方面来进行教育和学习，即一方面从工作和业务的实践中学习，另一方面进行政治和理论学习。配合和结合着这两个方面的学习，适当地参加社会生活的观察和实践。
    教育和学习的目的，对于知识分子，是要帮助他们继续进行自我改造，逐步做到他们的思想能够同他们已经改变了和正在改变着的社会地位相适应；对于资产阶级分子，是要帮助他们对最后改变资本主义所有制获得思想准备，并且把自己逐步改变为名副其实的劳动者。
      为了适应各界民主人士和工商业者对政治学习和理论学习的要求，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会于1956年3月27日发布了“关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定”。决定中包含的教学方针是：（1）参加学习与否，必须按照自愿原则；（2）必须贯彻自由思考，自由辩论的教学方法；（3）不查历史不查思想；（4）在学习条件上党外人士和共产党员一视同仁。这个决定正在各地实施。要使这个决定能够圆满地实现，必须请各省、各市、各自治区的负责同志注意加以领导和帮助。
  正确处理机关、学校和企业
    内部的合作共事的关系
    正确地处理机关、学校和企业内部的合作共事的关系，是帮助人们进行自我教育和巩固人民民主统一战线的一个重要的关键。由于中国共产党在国家生活中的领导地位，机关、学校和企业内部合作共事的关系，主要是共产党员同党外人士之间的关系。共产党员在这里要采取主动的态度，负起主要的责任，同时，党外人士也有他们自己的责任。目前有两种类型的合作共事关系。一种是机关、学校和国营企业中共产党员同一般党外人士间的工作关系，这里，主要又是同党外知识分子的工作关系。这种工作关系已经有了几年的历史。由于这方面的绝大部分知识分子已经是工人阶级的一部分，这方面的关系基本上就已经成为工人阶级内部的关系。因此，一般地说，共产党员在这方面应当同党外人士建立起社会主义的互助合作关系；彼此间的矛盾和分歧，也要采取同志的态度加以处理。这方面的关系，几年来是有进步的，在中共中央召开了知识分子问题会议以后，各方面更有许多改进。但是问题还不少。问题的主要方面，首先是要共产党员充分信任党外人士，保证他们有职有权，帮助他们尽职尽责。这需要分工负责，使党外人士充分有事作，有作事的条件，并且获得必要的支持和帮助；需要同党外人士商量办事，并且使党外人士有充分发表意见的机会，彼此开诚相见，沟通思想。要使这方面的工作关系进一步改善，除了思想认识方面的问题要加以澄清外，还需要在工作制度上有所改进。
    另一种是公私合营企业和一部分国营企业中，职工和共产党员同资产阶级分子间的共同工作关系。这种关系绝大部分是在社会主义改造高潮中建立起来的，是一种新的关系。这种关系的建立，反映着企业原来的资本主义生产关系的根本改变，反映着资产阶级分子向着劳动者的逐步过渡。但是，这种改变现在还没有完成；这个过渡，就大多数人说，现在还只是开始走了第一步。因此，这种共同工作的关系同时又是阶级关系。正确地处理这种关系，有重要的政治意义。企业中的职工、共产党员和资方人员都应当有这样一个共同的认识，就是：企业是进一步团结、教育和改造资方人员的主要基地。资方人员过去长期从事工商业，在企业中继续工作和学习，逐步改造成为名副其实的劳动者，这比较起来是对他们最为便利的途径。
    资方人员属于民族资产阶级，他们与官僚资产阶级分子不同，在经营管理、科学技术或者生产技能上，大多数人具有一定的能力和经验。经过几年的教育，资方人员普遍地提高了觉悟，逐渐增多地出现了大批的接受社会主义改造的积极分子和相当数量的进步核心分子；社会主义改造高潮到来之后，这种积极分子有从少数发展为多数的趋势，进步核心分子也在日益增多。这就是说，绝大多数的资方人员已经是我们国家的积极因素，再经过必要的教育改造之后，可以成为参加社会主义事业的重要的积极因素。这些情况，是在企业中同资方人员建立和发展合作共事关系的政治基础和有利条件。
    但是，为了巩固这种合作共事关系，我们还必须用坦率的态度指出另一方面的情况。由于资方人员曾经长期直接地剥削和压迫工人，在工人群众中积下了阶级的恶感。解放以后，不少资方人员又曾经一度肆行“五毒”，向工人阶级猖狂进攻。大家知道，由于这种猖狂进攻，共产党和人民政府领导工人阶级进行了有历史意义的“五反”斗争，这一斗争不但教育了工人群众和国家工作人员，而且教育了资产阶级分子。也正由于大多数资产阶级分子在这一次斗争中认识了五毒罪行对于祖国和人民的危害，认识到接受工人阶级领导和走上社会主义道路的必要，才使今天的社会主义改造有可能采取更为温和的形式。当然，就在五反以后，甚至就在企业合营以后的一个时期中，大多数资方人员在经营管理方法上的资本主义的传统和习惯，也还没有从思想上和实践上完全改变，这就不能不给企业带来某些不利于社会主义的消极因素。这些情况，都是建立和发展这方面合作共事关系的困难和不利条件。
  企业的公股代表要负起积极团结、教育资方人员的责任
    由此可以明白，要适当地建立和发展这种合作共事关系，需要作很多工作，需要相当长时间的努力，逐步前进。一方面，企业的职工首先是公股代表和共产党员，要充分地认识和估计到资方人员的积极作用和可以逐步改造成为劳动者的可能性，根据党和人民政府的政策，根据工人阶级解放全人类的伟大精神，负起积极团结、教育资方人员的责任，鼓励和帮助他们发挥有利于生产、经营的积极性，并继续进行自我改造。为此，要根据“量才使用，适当照顾”的政策，对他们的职务和工作加以适当的安排；要吸收他们的代表参加民主管理机构，并且使他们对分工负责的事情有职有权；要吸收他们参加企业的改组和改革，参加社会主义竞赛。在工作中要给他们以应有的信任，发挥他们的长处，并且帮助他们做出成绩；要同他们商量办事，认真地考虑他们的意见和批评。要规定适当的制度，使资方人员有可能参加应该参加的行政业务会议，阅读有关的行政业务文件。对他们的成绩和积极作用，要一视同仁地给以奖励和表扬，对他们的缺点和错误，则要采取与人为善的态度，帮助他们认识和改正。在这些工作中，公股代表和共产党员要注意争取工商业联合会和民主建国会的帮助，并要给资方人员以必要的时间，使他们有可能参加政治和业务的学习，参加工商业联合会和民主建国会的活动和其他社会生活的实践。企业中的公股代表和共产党员要作好这些工作，是有很多困难的。他们大多数是初次同资方人员合作共事，政策知识不够，实际经验缺乏，加以具体制度太少，上下左右的看法又不常一致，而同资方人员的关系又不仅是共同工作关系，还同时是阶级关系。因此，他们觉得这是一种困难的工作，并且心里有许多顾虑。我们要求一切有关的党组织和政府领导部门，经过各种有效的措施，在思想上，组织上和实际工作上，对企业中的公股代表和共产党员给以及时的指导，并给以充分的支持和帮助，使他们有信心并有办法把这项工作作好。
  资方人员要积极参加生产
  和经营；努力进行自我改造
    另一方面，我们希望资方人员深刻地认识：在企业中合作共事，既需要发挥自己的积极作用，努力参加生产和经营，作出成绩；又需要努力进行自我改造，在思想认识和工作实践上破掉资本主义的一套，立好社会主义的一套，争取从资方人员逐步地变成名副其实的劳动者，使他们同职工之间从两重性的工作关系变成完全的社会主义的合作互助关系。资方人员的自我改造还是一项重要而又艰巨的工作，轻视或者忽视这项工作的重要性和艰巨性，都是错误的。因此，为要达到上述的目的，除了需要公股代表和共产党员的积极努力以外，资方人员也需要在工作和学习中，主动地和诚恳地去接近公方人员和共产党员，争取他们的帮助和支持；需要主动地去接近工人群众，在必要的时候主动地向工人群众进行恰当的自我批评，更要依靠自己的诚实行动去改变工人群众的观感。资方人员需要向工人群众学习；要把自己改造成为劳动人民，首先要向劳动人民学习——我们希望资方人员能够了解这个真理。资方人员如果能够采取这种积极、主动而又真实、诚恳的态度，就造成了一定的条件，有利于克服上述合作共事关系中的某些消极的和困难的因素，使这方面的关系能够比较正常地建立和发展起来。当然，像前面所已经一再指出的，在建立和发展这种关系上，公股代表和共产党员负有更多的责任，需要做更多的工作，这是没有疑问的。
    共产党员要热情帮助
    党外人士，并且虚心向
        党外人士学习
    这里，还要着重地指出一点，在上述两种合作共事的关系中，共产党员不仅要热情地帮助党外人士作好工作，进行自我教育，而且还必须虚心地向党外人士特别是知识分子和资方人员的长处学习。共产党员“要向那些有专门知识的人（专门家）和有调整大经济经验的人（资本家）学习”，“聪明的共产党员决不怕向资本家学习”（列宁）。我们共产党员必须承认，我们不懂得而党外人士懂得的东西，是很多很多的。对于党外人士所具有而我们所缺乏的一切有用的知识和经验，我们必须有一个决心，又有一个谦虚态度，经过各种适当的形式，去向他们学习。我们这样作了，同时又有利于改进和巩固我们同党外人士和资方人员的合作。
    我们应该宣传长期共存
      互相监督的方针
    各民主党派、人民团体、各界民主人士和人民政治协商会议，在巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线的斗争中，已经起了应有的作用，今后还需要发挥更多的作用。这里，我只想就民主党派工作说点意见。多年来的经验证明，各民主党派不但在团结和动员一切积极力量方面起着重要的作用，而且在互相监督方面也起着重要的作用。中共中央已经提出了共产党和各民主党派长期共同存在，互相监督，首先是对共产党起监督作用的方针。这是一个重大的方针，这个方针的提出，同时就是再一次地宣告，同党外人士实行民主合作，是共产党的一条“固定不移”和“永远不变”的原则。有人说，“共产党里面有人不重视民主党派，民主党派里面也有人不重视民主党派”，我觉得这不只是若干人的观点问题，同时也是一种社会现象的反映。我们应当宣传长期共存和互相监督的方针。这既可以帮助人们澄清他们对于民主党派的政治作用和历史地位的怀疑，又足以鼓舞各民主党派的成员更多地从事有益于人民的活动。一方面，认识和估计澄清了，另一方面，有益的事情作得多了，人们的观感就会进一步发生变化，民主党派的意见就会更加受到各方面的重视，它们的工作和活动就会更加受到各方面的支持。几年来，各民主党派都有很大的进步和成绩，在社会主义革命高潮到来之后，它们先后召开了代表大会或者中央会议，讨论和决定了它们各自的组织和工作的方针。中共中央赞同它们的方针，中共的各个有关的组织和党员将继续对各民主党派的工作给以友谊的支持和帮助。
  某些共产党员的缺点和毛病
    目前，统一战线工作中存在着许多问题。有些问题是随着我国政治形势的根本变化而发生的，它们是新的事物和新的矛盾的反映。有些问题反映着新旧事物间的矛盾，那些在过去情况下很适用而现在需要加以改变的办法和规章，属于这一类。还有一些问题则确实反映着我们工作中的缺点和毛病。对于各方面的问题，我们都需要分别地和逐步地加以研究和处理。这里，我只想谈谈某些共产党员方面的缺点和毛病。例如在工作关系上不尊重党外人士（资方人员在内）的职权，不支持他们行使职权，而独断专行，把别人搁在一旁；不愿同党外人士商量办事，不容许不同意见和反对意见，而把自己的意志强加于人，更不要说向别人的长处学习。有这种缺点和毛病的同志还保存一种狭隘的关门主义或者宗派主义的作风，他们还不了解毛主席所指示的，“国事是国家的公事，不是一党一派的私事。因此，共产党员只有对党外人士实行民主合作的义务，而无排斥别人，垄断一切的权利。”“共产党员应当同党外人士实行民主合作，不得一意孤行，把持包办。”“共产党员必须倾听党外人士的意见，给别人以说话的机会。别人说得对的，我们应该欢迎，并要跟别人的长处学习；别人说得不对，也应该让别人说完，然后慢慢加以解释。共产党员决不可自以为是，盛气凌人，以为自己是什么都好，别人是什么都不好；决不可把自己关在小房子里，自吹自擂，称王称霸。”有些同志对民主党派和一部分人民团体的权利尊重不够，他们还不了解一切民主党派和人民团体在法律上居于平等地位。我国的民主党派和人民团体在政治上有着互相协商、互相帮助和互相监督的传统，我们应当继续发扬这个传统。为要发扬这个传统，就必须严格地尊重各民主党派和人民团体在宪法赋予的权利义务范围内的政治自由和组织独立性，任何党派和团体对其他党派和团体的这种自由和独立，都没有权利加以干涉。有的同志对进步人士是欢迎的，但是对处在中间和落后状态的人士就不甚欢迎，甚至敬而远之。他们还不了解，我们党的政策是，除了反革命分子和其他坏分子外，共产党员应当热心同一切党外人士实行民主合作；从对中、上层方面的统一战线工作说，共产党员更应当同进步人士一道向处在中间和落后状态的人士多多地进行工作。有的同志对党外人士的进步估计不足，在同党外人士的关系上，只注意了有所区别一面，忽视了共同性和共同性逐渐增多的一面，因此，缺乏按照社会主义原则互相帮助、互相学习的热忱；在许多应当一视同仁的地方，反而采取了区别对待的办法。有的同志对民主党派和同党外人士合作的必要性和长期性认识不足，从而对统一战线工作常常发生动摇，尤其在群众革命斗争的巨大浪头上每每发生这种动摇。这些同志还不了解下面这个真理：无产阶级只有解放全人类才能完全解放自己；还不了解毛主席所指示的，“共产党的这个同党外人士实行民主合作的原则，是固定不移的，是永远不变的。只要社会上还有党存在，加入党的人总是少数，党外的人总是多数，所以党员总是要和党外的人合作”。也还有某些同志，他们在敌我界限的问题上，在重要原则性的分歧上，不严肃地加以区别，不诚恳坦白地辨明是非，而采取了庸俗的自由主义态度。上述这些是比较严重的缺点和毛病。当然，所有这些缺点和毛病一应俱全的同志只是个别的，但是确有一些同志，包括某些统一战线工作部门的同志在内，是具有上述一种或者几种缺点和毛病的。这些缺点和毛病也不简单地是由于个人的原因，也是一种社会现象的反映，这就需要我们反复地进行宣传教育，但是，我们做得很不够。
  全面检查一次统一战线工作
    为了适应我国政治形势的根本变化，今年二月，中共方面举行了第五次全国统一战线工作会议，讨论了统一战线工作的任务和方针，并决定全面地检查一次统一战线工作（包括民族工作和这个发言中没有讲到的工作和问题在内）。我们已经开始进行这种检查。因为统一战线工作是大家有分和大家关心的事情，同时为了发挥监督作用和集思广益，我们邀请各民主党派和民主人士共同进行检查，欢迎各方面的朋友揭发和批判共产党员特别是统一战线工作部门的缺点和毛病。我们不仅要揭露缺点和毛病，加以改正；还要发现和推广先进经验，发现和解决新的问题。我们不仅要沟通思想，明确政策；还要在实际工作上和制度上找出一些适当的措施。为了进一步改进关系，增强团结，为了动员积极因素，并克服消极因素，总之，为了继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，这就是我们检查统一战线工作的目的。我相信经过各方面的共同努力，我们能够达到这个目的。
    我的发言只讲了统一战线工作的几个方面，还有一些工作和问题没有讲，不是因为那些工作和问题不重要，而是因为不可能一次都讲到。请对我这个发言的内容，加以批评指正。
