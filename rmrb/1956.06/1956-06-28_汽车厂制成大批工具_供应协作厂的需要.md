Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 27th: Just as more than forty collaborating factories across the country are sending their trial-produced collaborative products to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Tool Department of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has also prepared the last batch of inspected and qualified tools to support collaborating factories in Beijing, Harbin, Shenyang, and other places to produce these collaborative products in batches.

The tools manufactured by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant for various collaborating factories include complete sets of cutting tools, fixtures, stamping dies, forging dies, and die-casting molds. These precision tools are mostly new products that the tool manufacturing and repair departments of the newly built and renovated collaborating factories cannot manufacture due to technical limitations. To date, the staff of the Central Design Office and the Tool Department of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have designed and manufactured more than 960 pieces (sets) of tools for various collaborating factories.

The tool manufacturing workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant manufactured more than 270 kinds of stamping dies for the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory, most of which are used to process fine parts; some of the punches of the stamping dies are as fine as embroidery needle tips.

    汽车厂制成大批工具
    供应协作厂的需要
    据新华社长春27日电　正当全国四十多个协作厂把试制成功的协作产品送到第一汽车制造厂的时候，第一汽车制造厂的工具处也已经准备好最后一批检验合格的工具，支援北京、哈尔滨、沈阳等地协作厂成批地生产这些协作产品。
    第一汽车制造厂为各个协作厂制造的工具，包括成套的刃具、夹具、冲模、锻模、压铸模。这些精密的工具，多半是各新建和改建的协作厂的工具制造和修理部门因技术条件限制而不能制造的新产品。到目前止，第一汽车厂的中央设计室和工具处的职工，已经先后为各个协作厂设计和制造了九百六十多件（套）工具。
    第一汽车厂的工具制造工人，为哈尔滨电表仪器厂制造的二百七十多种冲模，多半是用来加工精细另件的；有些冲模的冲头，像绣花针尖那样细小。
