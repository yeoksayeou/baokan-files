Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: A responsible person from the Central Meteorological Observatory today analyzed the reasons for the early and heavy rainfall in the Huai River basin this year to a Xinhua News Agency reporter.

    This person in charge said that from June 2nd to June 11th, heavy rain fell in most areas of the Huai River basin. Huaiyin received 235 mm of rainfall, Fuyang 463 mm, Bengbu 400 mm, Dongtai 216 mm, Zhengyangguan 300 mm, Hefei 140 mm, Kaifeng 152 mm, Gushi 297 mm, Xuchang 200 mm, Nanyang 163 mm, Suiping 242 mm, Xinyang 290 mm, and Xincai 339 mm. The rainfall in these areas in ten days is equivalent to two to four times the average rainfall in June in previous years, and also exceeds the average total for June and July in previous years. Since June 7th, the subtropical high pressure over the Pacific Ocean has retreated to the South China Sea and the Indochina Peninsula, and the warm and humid air south of the Yangtze River has been greatly weakened. The high pressure near the Sea of Okhotsk also gradually moved southward into the North Pacific region east of Japan from June 9th, so the weather system and airflow in northern China became active, and the precipitation weather that had stagnated in the Huai River basin for many days also changed, and the weather tended to improve.

    The amount of rainfall in the Huai River basin in the past ten days is indeed astonishing. 1954 was a year of major flooding. For the Huai River basin, the main rainfall was concentrated in July, while June was about 50 mm less than in previous years (e.g., Bengbu 29 mm, Zhengyangguan 41 mm, Xinyang 72 mm, Suxian 23 mm); however, July 1954 had 400 mm to 800 mm more than the same month in previous years (e.g., Bengbu 516 mm, Zhengyangguan 911 mm, Xinyang 662 mm, Suxian 961 mm). It can be seen that the rainfall in the first ten days of June this year is much less than in July 1954. The difference is that summer came late in 1954, and the plum rain season was long, while this year the rainy season arrived early, a full month earlier in the Huai River basin.

    Why did the heavy rain season in the Huai River basin arrive early?

    Analyzing the weather development process in the past ten days or so, we found that the airflow situation is indeed somewhat similar to the typical plum rain weather pattern in June and July 1954. For example, the strengthening and northward position of the subtropical high pressure in the Pacific Ocean at 25 degrees north latitude, there is a strong high pressure stationed near the Sea of Okhotsk in eastern Siberia, and there is a cold low pressure moving eastward in northern Xinjiang and Siberia. Several times, relatively cold air intruded southeastward from the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, causing varying degrees of precipitation along the path of the eastward movement of the cold air. These conditions are similar to 1954, but not exactly the same. First, the strengthening and development of the Pacific high pressure is different from 1954. In 1954, the Pacific high pressure extended westward from the central Pacific and penetrated into the southeastern part of mainland China; while this year, the strengthening of the Pacific high pressure was the result of a relatively strong high pressure moving eastward over the Tibetan Plateau at the end of May and merging with the Pacific high pressure to strengthen it. Therefore, the strengthening process of this high pressure is different from that of a general Pacific high pressure, especially its position is more northerly. Second, the increase in precipitation in the Huai River basin began on June 2nd, and the appearance and stagnation of the high pressure in the Sea of Okhotsk region also occurred after June 2nd. In other words, the establishment of this high pressure is different from 1954. In 1954, this high pressure was already established in May before the major flood. Third, in 1954, the path of cold air was mostly eastward from over the Tibetan Plateau, while this year, from June 1st to 10th, the path of cold air was from the Hexi Corridor to the Qinling Mountains and then into the Huai River. Due to the more northerly path of the cold air and the more northerly position of the Pacific high pressure, the interaction of cold and warm air occurred in the more northerly Huai River basin rather than in the more southerly Yangtze River basin.

    Analyzing the above characteristics, it can be seen that because the occurrence and strengthening of the Pacific high pressure are different from the general situation, its weakening is also relatively fast.

    Every year from June 15th to July 15th is the time for plum rain in the Jianghuai area. The airflow pattern that causes plum rain weather at this time generally occurs only two or three times each year, each lasting about three or four days. This heavy rain in the Huai River basin was caused by the first plum rain weather pattern this year. Of course, it may reappear in the future. However, the amount of rainfall and the area in which it is concentrated will depend on the strength of the confrontation between cold and warm air at that time. The atmospheric circulation characteristics that have appeared this year are different from the circulation characteristics of 1954, and also different from 1931. Therefore, based on the current data analysis and research, we have no reason to predict that the Jianghuai River basin will experience such heavy rain and floods as in 1954 or 1931 this year.

    The person in charge of the Central Meteorological Observatory pointed out that the general Jianghuai plum rain weather season is from late June to mid-July, and now the early plum rain has temporarily stopped. The conditions for heavy rain in the Yangtze River basin, the Huai River basin, and the Yellow River basin still exist in the next two months. We cannot relax our flood prevention work because of the temporary end of this early heavy rain.

    今年淮河流域雨期提早和多雨的原因
    据新华社12日讯　中央气象台负责人今天对新华社记者分析了关于今年淮河流域雨期提早和多雨的原因。
    这位负责人说，从六月二日起到六月十一日止，淮河流域大部分地区下了大雨。淮阴降雨235公厘，阜阳463公厘，蚌埠400公厘，东台216公厘，正阳关300公厘，合肥140公厘，开封152公厘，固始297公厘，许昌200公厘，南阳163公厘，遂平242公厘，信阳290公厘，新蔡339公厘，这些地区十天内的降水量相当于历年六月平均降水量的两倍到四倍，也超过了历年六七月两个月的平均的总和。从六月七日起，太平洋副热带高压已经退到南海和中印半岛，长江以南的暖湿空气已经大大减弱，鄂霍次克海附近高气压也从六月九日起逐渐向南移动进入日本以东的北太平洋区域，因而我国北部天气系统和气流随着活跃起来，淮河流域停滞多日的降水天气也起了变动，天气趋向好转。
    淮河流域十天来的降水量的确是惊人的。1954年是发生大水的一年，对淮河流域来说，主要的雨量是集中在七月份，而六月份反比往年少50公厘左右（如蚌埠29公厘，正阳关41公厘，信阳72公厘，宿县23公厘）；但是，1954年7月份比历年同月多出400公厘到800公厘（如蚌埠516公厘，正阳关911公厘，信阳662公厘，宿县961公厘），可见今年六月上旬降水量比1954年7月份少得多。所不同的是1954年夏季来临迟，梅雨季长，而今年雨季是提早了，在淮河流域整整提早了一个月。
    为什么淮河流域大雨时节提早？
    分析最近这十几天的天气发展过程，我们发现气流情况确实和1954年六、七月份里典型的梅雨天气型式有些相似。例如，太平洋副热带高压的加强和位置偏北在北纬二十五度，西伯利亚东部鄂霍次克海附近有一个强大的高压停留，新疆北部和西伯利亚都有一个冷低压东移，有几次比较冷的空气从西藏高原的北部边缘向东南方向侵入，在冷空气东移的途径上造成了不同程度的降水，这些条件和1954年是相似的，但是并不完全相同。首先是太平洋高压的加强和发展同1954年不一样，1954年太平洋高压是从太平洋中部向西伸长，深入到我国大陆的东南部；而今年太平洋高压的加强是由于五月底西藏高原上空有一较强的高压向东移动和太平洋高压合并加强的结果，因此这个高压的加强过程和一般的太平洋高压不一样，特别是它的位置比较偏北。第二，淮河流域的降水开始加大是在六月二日，而鄂霍次克海地区的高气压的出现和停留也在六月二日以后，换句话说这个高压的建立和1954年不同，1954年这个高压早在大水前的五月份已经成立。第三，1954年冷空气的路径大都是自西藏高原上空东移，而今年六月一日到十日的冷空气的路径都是自河西走廊到秦岭再侵入淮河。由于冷空气的路径较偏北，和太平洋高压的位置也较偏北，使得冷暖空气的交绥作用发生于较偏北的淮河流域而不是在更偏南的长江流域。
    分析了上面的这些特点，可以看出，因为太平洋高压的发生和加强不同于一般情况，它的衰退也就比较快。
    每年六月十五日到七月十五日是江淮地区发生梅雨的时节，每年这时节发生梅雨天气的气流型式一般不过二三回，每回约三四天。这一次淮河流域的暴雨是今年第一次梅雨天气形势所引起的。当然，以后还有可能再出现。但是，雨量的大小和集中在什么地区，还要看当时的冷暖空气对峙的强弱而定。今年已经出现的大气环流特点和1954年的环流特点是不同的，和1931年也不同。所以，以目前的资料分析研究，我们还没有理由推测今年江淮流域会出现像1954年或1931年那样大的暴雨和洪水。
    中央气象台负责人指出，一般江淮梅雨天气时节在六月下旬到七月中旬，现在是提早的梅雨暂时中止。今后两个月在长江流域、淮河流域和黄河流域出现暴雨的条件还存在。我们不能因为这次早期暴雨的暂时结束而松弛了防汛工作。
