    Significant Development in Childcare Organizations in Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    According to recent statistics, since liberation, industrial and mining enterprises across the country have established nearly 5,000 nurseries and more than 1,900 breastfeeding rooms. In 1955, more than 158,000 children were enrolled in nurseries, and more than 34,000 children were breastfed.
