To Vice Premier Chen and all the comrades of the Central Delegation, comrades:

Although the Central Delegation has only stayed in Tibet for a little over a month this time, in this short period of time they have helped us with a lot of work. For example, they successfully established the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region; they gave many valuable instructions on strengthening and consolidating the unity between fraternal ethnic groups, especially between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, as well as within the Tibetan ethnic group, thereby developing the political, economic, and cultural life of the Tibetan people. These instructions have opened up a glorious path for the various undertakings of building a prosperous and happy new Tibet in the future. On this occasion of parting, please allow me to once again express my heartfelt gratitude and respect to you on behalf of all the monks and lay people of Tibet. We sincerely hope that the Central Delegation can stay in Tibet for a longer period of time and give us more instructions and help. However, because you have to go back to attend meetings or rush to do other work, we cannot help but bid you farewell with reluctance. However, we believe that this separation is only temporary, and we will have many opportunities to meet in this united and friendly big family of the motherland. At the same time, although we are temporarily separated, our will and desire to unite all ethnic groups to jointly build the motherland are constantly linked together, so our temporary separation is equivalent to no separation.

If the Tibetan people are to develop, necessary reforms must inevitably be carried out in the internal systems. However, the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Chairman Mao have consistently adhered to the policy of peaceful reform in minority areas. I hope to convey to the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao that we wholeheartedly support this policy, and hope that more instructions will be given in the specific implementation. At the same time, I hope that the fellow compatriots of all minority ethnic groups will constantly introduce to us the successful experiences they have gained in various aspects.

Finally, I wish
Vice Premier Chen and the comrades of the delegation a safe journey, and hope to meet again soon.

    达赖喇嘛的欢送词陈副总理为首的中央代表团的各位同志，同志们：
    这次中央代表团来到西藏虽然仅只住了一个多月，但是在这短短的时间内帮助我们作了很多的工作，例如，圆满地成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会；对于增强和巩固兄弟民族间，特别是汉藏民族间以及西藏民族内部的团结、从而发展西藏民族的政治、经济和文化给了很多宝贵的指示。这些对于今后建设繁荣幸福的新西藏的各项事业开辟了光辉的道路。在此临别之际，让我再一次代表西藏全体僧俗人民向你们致以衷心的感谢和敬意。我们衷心地希望中央代表团能够在西藏多住些时间，对我们给以更多的指示和帮助，但是，由于你们要回去开会或赶作其他的工作，我们不能不以依依惜别的心情欢送你们，但是我们相信这种离别只是暂时的，我们在这个团结友爱的祖国大家庭里，还有很多见面的机会。同时我们虽然暂时离别了，但是我们各民族团结一致共同建设祖国的意志和愿望经常地联系在一起，这样我们暂时的离别还是等于没有离别。
    西藏民族要得到发展，在内部的各种制度上不可避免地要进行必要的改革，但是中国共产党、中央人民政府和伟大的领袖毛主席在少数民族地区一贯坚持着和平改革的方针，希望转呈党中央、中央人民政府和毛主席，我们衷心地拥护这一方针，并且希望在具体执行方面给以更多的指示，同时希望各个少数民族的同胞们，给我们经常不断的介绍在各方面所取得的成功的经验。
    最后祝
    陈副总理和代表团的同志们一路平安，同时希望很快的见面。
