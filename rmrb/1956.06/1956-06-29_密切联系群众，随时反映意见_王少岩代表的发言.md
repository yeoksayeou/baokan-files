Maintain Close Ties with the Masses and Reflect Opinions at Any Time
— Speech by Representative Wang Shaoyan

    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 final accounts and the 1956 budget, as well as the reports of all the leading comrades. After listening to Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech on the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, I learned about the situation of the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises across the country, the problems that exist, and the government's methods and steps to solve these problems, and I feel very excited.
    Our province, along with the rest of the country, followed the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and, in January of this year, also launched a high tide of transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises. We completed the joint operation work in a very short period of time and achieved great results. However, such an unprecedented and extremely broad and rapid reform movement is absolutely impossible to be without shortcomings in the work. To correct these shortcomings, we must rely on the leadership of the relevant government departments, but also on us, the industrialists and businessmen, to report the specific situation to the relevant authorities at any time, so that the government can solve the problems faster and better.
    Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out in his speech that the most problems currently exist among the commissioned sales agents in small businesses and hawkers. Recently, we conducted some understanding of the distribution and sales agents of the Kunming Department Store system and the Trade Company system, and found that they currently have the following problems:
    1. According to my understanding of dozens of households, their situation is basically the same as what Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out in his speech. The business situation of these dozens of households is: about 40% can achieve a balance of income and expenditure, and about 60% cannot. The reason for not being able to balance is mainly due to the excessive number of family members and heavy burdens, and the turnover cannot be increased. The reason why the turnover cannot be increased is that the commission sales quota is too strict. For example, the commission sales quota of the Trade Company system is limited to within 100 yuan, and the commission sales quota of the Department Store system is limited to within 400 yuan. The numbers seem to be a bit too small. If the commission sales goods are not fast-selling goods, the turnover will be relatively slow, and the turnover will be reduced, which will naturally affect the income. They all require that the commission sales limit can be relaxed and more fast-selling goods can be allocated.
    2. For households whose income and expenditure cannot be balanced, the current solutions to the difficulties are: some women watch the door, and men go out to carry things to subsidize the family; some children who have jobs can subsidize a little, and some rely on selling living materials to maintain. Due to financial difficulties, many of them hope to be incorporated into joint state-private enterprises.
    As for the enterprises that have already been jointly operated, according to recent understanding, there are still the following problems among some capitalists:
    1. The business hours are too long, and there is a situation of uneven work and rest. The working hours of many grassroots store employees are generally 14 or 15 hours a day, and they feel that their bodies cannot support it. But on the other hand, some private individuals who are transferred to work in the company and the central store have a fixed working time every day according to the work schedule. Everyone feels that those who are transferred to the store and those who are transferred to the company have some uneven work and rest. People in the store require an eight-hour system.
    2. In terms of personnel arrangements, the personnel arrangement work in the Kunming area is still in progress. Some people who have not yet been arranged for work are still unable to settle down ideologically. At the same time, due to the undetermined position, there are some difficulties in the implementation of the work. Often, one thing forms a situation where you push me and I push you. This situation may exist to varying degrees in other places, and it is hoped that it will be resolved as soon as possible.
    In addition, in Kunming, some enterprises still have a shortage of goods and materials. For example, the various types of steel needed by the machinery industry feel scarce, but the tasks are very urgent; the Sichuan tobacco of the tobacco and tea industry has also been in short supply for several months; and some paper is also experiencing difficulties in supply.
    What I have talked about above is only in Kunming. It may also exist elsewhere. I firmly believe that these problems will be quickly resolved under the correct leadership of the central government and the active efforts of the local governments.
    From the above situation, I deeply feel that we private industrialists and businessmen have not done enough in this regard in the past; especially as a people's representative, I have not done enough. At the beginning of this year, a high tide of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce appeared in various places. In order to meet the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen to accept socialist transformation at that time, the government adopted the method of approving joint state-private ownership and cooperativization at one time. However, the State Council saw that after the one-time approval of joint operation, there were many problems that needed to be solved batch by batch and in stages. In early February, it made a decision that all private enterprises and handicrafts should continue to operate as before for half a year after the approval of joint state-private ownership and cooperativization. During this half year, if we industrialists and businessmen can adopt an active rather than a passive, a proactive rather than a reactive, a selfless rather than a self-interested attitude to reflect opinions and put forward solutions, and jointly solve all the problems of private industry and commerce after joint operation under the leadership of the local party committee, then there may be fewer problems, and they may be solved faster and better.
    In this spirit, I fully endorse the various methods proposed by Vice Premier Chen Yun to solve the current problems in industry and commerce, and in my future work, I will further maintain close ties with the masses, reflect opinions, and assist the government in firmly and properly implementing these instructions, and strive to complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

### 密切联系群众，随时反映意见——王少岩代表的发言

    密切联系群众，随时反映意见
    ——王少岩代表的发言
    我对李先念副总理所作关于1955年决算和1956年预算的报告、及各位首长的报告都完全拥护。又听了陈云副总理关于私营工商业社会主义改造问题的发言，了解到全国私营工商业改造的情况以及存在的问题和政府解决这些问题的办法和步骤，感觉十分兴奋。
    我省也和全国一道，随着农业合作化高潮到来的同时，于今年一月接着掀起了对私营工商业改造的高潮，在很短的时间内完成了合营工作，取得了很大成绩。但是，像这样一件史无前例的极其广泛和迅速的改革运动，在工作中绝对不可能没有缺点，要纠正这些缺点固然要靠政府有关部门的领导，但也要靠我们工商业者把具体情况随时向有关机关反映，才可以使政府把问题解决得更快更好。
    陈云副总理在发言中指出目前存在问题较多的是小商小贩中的代购代销户。最近我们曾对昆明的百货公司系统和贸易公司系统的经销代销户进行了一些了解，发现他们当中目前存在有以下的问题。
    一、根据我所了解的几十户来看，他们的情况和陈云副总理在发言中所指出的情况基本相同，这几十户的营业情况是：能够达到收支平衡的约占40％左右，不能平衡的约占60％，不能平衡的原因主要是家庭人口过多，负担重，营业额不能增加。营业额不能增加的原因是由于代销额限制过严，如贸易公司系统的代销额规定在100元以内，百货公司系统的代销额规定在400元以内，数目似嫌小了一些，假使碰到的代销货品不是畅销的货物时，周转就比较慢，营业额降低，就自然要影响到收益，他们都要求能够放宽代销限额，并多配些畅销货物。
    二、收支不能平衡的户头，目前解决困难的办法：有些是女的看门，男的出去挑东西补助家用；有些子女有工作的可以补助一点，也有的靠出卖生活资料维持。由于生活有困难，他们很多人都希望能够并入公私合营。
    至于已经合营的企业，在有些资方中根据最近了解，仍然存在有以下几个问题：
    一、营业时间过长，且有劳逸不均的情况，很多基层门市店的营业人员，每天工作时间一般都在十四、五个钟头，感觉身体支持不了。但另一方面，有的私方调在公司及中心店工作的，每天按照上下班制度，就有一定的工作时间。大家感到调到门市部的和调在公司的，在工作上有些劳逸不均，在门市部的人就要求实行八小时制度。
    二、在人事安排方面，现在昆明地区的人事安排工作还在继续进行。有些对工作尚未得到安排的，思想上还不能安定，同时由于职务未定，在工作的贯彻上也有一些困难，常常一桩事形成你推我，我推你的情况，这种情况可能在其他地方也会不同程度地存在的，希望尽速地加以解决。
    此外，在昆明方面，有些企业还存在有货源和材料缺乏的情况。比如机器业需要的各种钢材就感觉缺乏，但任务却十分紧迫；烟茶业的川烟也已经缺了几个月；有些纸张在供应上也发生困难。
    以上所谈，是昆明一个地方的，旁的地方也可能有。我深信这些问题在中央的正确领导和地方的积极努力下，一定会很快地得到解决。
    从上述情况，我深感我们私营工商业者过去在这方面做的工作不够；优其是作为一个人民代表做的工作更不够。今年年初在各地出现了资本主义工商业的社会主义改造高潮，政府为满足工商业者当时接受社会主义改造的热情，采取一次批准公私合营和合作化的方式。但国务院看到一次批准合营后有许多问题需要分批、分期地逐个加以解决，在二月初就作出决定，要所有私营企业和手工业在批准公私合营和合作化以后，一律照旧经营，半年不动。在这半年的时期内，我们工商业者如果都能采取积极的、而不是消极的，主动的、而不是被动的，大公无私的、而不是为个人打算的，反映意见，提出办法，在当地党的领导下，共同解决私营工商业在合营后的一切问题，那么，问题就可能少些，也可能解决得更快一些和更好一些。
    本着这种精神，我完全拥护陈云副总理所提出的解决工商业中目前存在问题的各种办法，并在今后自己的工作岗位上要更进一步地密切联系群众，反映意见，协助政府坚决地、妥善地贯彻这些指示，为完成资本主义工商业的社会主义改造事业而奋斗。
