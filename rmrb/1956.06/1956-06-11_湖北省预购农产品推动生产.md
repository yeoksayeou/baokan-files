(Our Wuhan News) Hubei Province has overfulfilled its planned advance purchases of cotton, tea, and ramie for this year.

The Hubei Provincial Agricultural Products Purchasing Department, through advance purchases of agricultural products, provided farmers with down payments, resolving some of their production difficulties. Tea farmers in the four townships of Dayu, Nanhe, Wawu, and Ganxi in the Enshi Special District received more than 15,000 yuan in down payments, purchasing ten tea-picking machines and some chemical fertilizers. Through advance purchases, farmers were guided to produce according to state plans, further increasing their enthusiasm for production. The Huaifang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Desheng Township, Lijiqu District, Xinzhou County, originally planned to apply 50 jin of base fertilizer per mu of cotton field, weed twice, and spray pesticides four times, with a yield of 60 jin of cotton per mu. After the advance purchase, they revised their cultivation plan: the yield per mu could reach 80 jin of cotton.

    湖北省预购农产品推动生产
    本报武汉讯　湖北省超额完成了今年预购棉花、茶叶、苎麻的计划。
    湖北省农产品采购厅通过预购农产品，给农民交付订金，解决了农民在生产上的部分困难。恩施专区大渔、南河、瓦屋、干溪四个乡的茶农得到订金一万五千多元，购买了采茶机十部和若干化学肥料等。通过预购，引导农民按照国家计划生产，进一步提高了农民的生产积极性。新洲县李集区德胜乡怀方农业生产合作社原计划每亩棉田施底肥五十斤，锄草两遍，打药四次，每亩产棉六十斤；预购后，他们修订了耕作计划：每亩可产棉八十斤。
