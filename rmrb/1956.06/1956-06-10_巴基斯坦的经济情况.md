Pakistan's Economic Situation
Li Gao

The fertile lands of the lower Ganges and the banks of the Indus River have nurtured human civilization since ancient times. Pakistan is a country rich in resources. Its eastern part is a humid and rainy alluvial plain, producing more than two-thirds of the world's jute, and is also a rice-producing area. Vast cotton and wheat fields stretch across West Pakistan, with many natural pastures among the plateaus and deserts. Underground are large deposits of minerals such as oil, chromium, and iron, and water resources are also abundant.

However, the two centuries of colonial rule in the past brought poverty and backwardness to the people of Pakistan. The colonialists not only prevented the development of industry within Pakistan, but also transformed agriculture into a deformed state. At that time, the country could not produce enough food for itself, and huge famines and starvation occurred constantly. The jute and cotton diligently grown by Pakistani farmers were cheaply taken away in large quantities—the colonialists regarded Pakistan as a supply base for single raw materials.

After a long struggle against colonialism, the people of Pakistan achieved independence in 1947 and have made many efforts to develop the national economy.

Starting in 1951, the Pakistani government announced the implementation of a "Six-Year Economic Development" plan, with the aim of improving agricultural irrigation and transportation, while developing industry. According to an act of Congress, the "Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation" was established in January 1952, with state investment and the absorption of some private capital and foreign investment to coordinate industrial construction matters. In the four years up to 1955, this company had established sixteen industrial construction projects with a total investment of 337 million rupees, and another seventeen projects with a total investment of approximately 400 million rupees will be put into production in the 1956-1957 fiscal year.

Due to the establishment of these industries, Pakistan, which previously needed to import almost all industrial products from abroad, can now supply itself with some light industrial products. The textile industry has developed relatively quickly. In 1948, the country had only over 170,000 spindles and over 4,800 looms, but by 1955, it had developed to over 1.5 million spindles and 23,000 looms. Coarse and medium-grade cotton fabrics can now meet the needs of the domestic market. Pakistan, which is rich in jute, originally had no jute manufacturing industry. After independence, it established jute mills with a total of 6,000 jute looms, and some jute products have been exported. Other industries such as the manufacture of paper, matches, cigarettes, sugar, cement, and certain chemical products have also developed. The Karachi Shipyard has completed the first phase of its project. At the time of independence, the total power generation capacity of the country's power plants was 75,000 kilowatts, which had increased to 180,000 kilowatts by 1955.

Recently, the Pakistani government has been drafting a new five-year development plan. The total investment in this plan is approximately 5 billion rupees, of which approximately one-half will be used for water conservancy and power generation. Half of the total investment will rely on foreign aid and foreign debt. The plan includes the construction of a steel plant with an annual output of 300,000 tons of steel and a comprehensive water conservancy project in Karnaphuli, East Pakistan, with a power generation capacity of 80,000 to 160,000 kilowatts, and flood control and irrigation functions.

However, the road to industrial development in Pakistan is not smooth. Some of its important economic sectors are still controlled by foreign capital and squeezed out by foreign commodities, who are unwilling for Pakistan to establish a national industry. Certain Western countries, under the guise of "aid," are making Pakistan accept unfavorable conditions and using valuable funds to increase military spending in large quantities. Pakistan's 1956-57 budget shows that its military expenditure accounts for 70% of total expenditure.

Agriculture accounts for 90% of Pakistan's national economy. The main crops are rice, wheat, cotton, and jute. In recent years, Pakistan has made great efforts to develop irrigation and expand cultivated areas. The area planted with rice has increased by approximately 20%, reaching nearly 10 million hectares. Wheat is sown on approximately 4 million hectares each year. In the bumper harvest year of 1953-1954, the output of rice and wheat reached more than 12 million tons, an increase of nearly 20% compared to the first year after independence (1947-1948). The output of coarse grains has also increased. However, landlords own more than two-thirds of Pakistan's arable land, which restricts the development of productivity. Natural disasters also occur frequently. The floods of the past two years have reduced grain production by approximately 10%.

Jute and cotton are Pakistan's most important cash crops. More than 80% of its annual foreign exchange income comes from the export of jute and cotton. Therefore, cotton and jute have a significant impact on Pakistan's national livelihood, national fiscal revenue, and construction funds. The production and sale of cotton and jute are valued by the Pakistani government and people. Around 1951, the export value of Pakistan's jute and cotton reached more than 2 billion rupees, with a maximum jute production of 1.2 million tons and cotton reaching more than 300,000 tons. However, in recent years, the export prices and sales of Pakistan's jute and cotton have been greatly adversely affected, and it has even been forced to accept foreign surplus cotton when its own cotton sales are sluggish. In the past two fiscal years, the total export price of Pakistan's cotton and jute has fallen to only about 1 billion rupees per year, with jute production falling to over 400,000 tons and cotton to over 200,000 tons. This has caused great difficulties for Pakistan's fiscal economy.

In recent years, in order to balance foreign trade, Pakistan has implemented policies to restrict imports and encourage the export of cotton and jute, and has strived to develop trade relations with some countries. China and Pakistan have had a considerable amount of trade since 1950, and in 1953, the two countries signed a trade agreement to exchange cotton and coal. In 1952 and 1955, China participated in the International Industrial Exhibition held in Pakistan twice. China is one of the largest buyers of Pakistan's cotton. The jute trade, which had been interrupted for a time, has recently resumed, and China has begun to sell some steel products and other goods to Pakistan.

The Soviet Union and Pakistan also have the desire to develop trade and economic cooperation relations. In February of this year, Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin said in response to questions from a Pakistan Unified News Agency reporter that there are full possibilities for mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Pakistan. The Soviet Union can purchase Pakistan's agricultural products, livestock products, and other commodities that Pakistan needs to sell, and can sell Pakistan complete sets of industrial equipment, various machinery, and other commodities that Pakistan needs. Through the United Nations Technical Assistance Fund, the Soviet Union has recently delivered some technical equipment to Pakistan. These measures have been warmly welcomed by Pakistani public opinion, and the Pakistani government has announced that it will conduct trade negotiations with the Soviet Union. Pakistan signed a trade agreement with Poland on February 6 this year, and is also in contact with Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other countries to develop trade relations. Pakistan's traditional trade relations with India have been redeveloping in recent years. There is no doubt that Pakistan's development of trade and economic cooperation relations with more countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit will help it stabilize and expand the market for export commodities and obtain the technical equipment needed for economic construction. This will be beneficial for Pakistan to develop its national economy, consolidate its independent status, and enhance its friendly relations with other countries.

    巴基斯坦的经济情况
    李高
    恒河下游和印度河两岸肥沃的土地，从远古以来就是滋育人类文明的地方。巴基斯坦是一个物产丰富的国家。它的东部是一片湿热多雨的冲积平原，那里生产着全世界三分之二以上的黄麻，也是盛产稻米的地区。辽阔的棉田和麦地绵亘在西巴基斯坦，高原广漠之间还有许多天然的牧场。地底下埋藏着大量的石油、铬、铁等矿产，水力资源也是丰富的。
    但是，过去两世纪中的殖民统治，使巴基斯坦人民遭遇了贫困和落后的灾难。殖民者不但阻止巴基斯坦境内工业的发展，农业也被变为畸形状态。那时，境内粮食不能自给，巨大的灾荒饥馑不断发生。巴基斯坦农民辛勤种植的黄麻和棉花，被廉价地大批掠走——殖民者把巴基斯坦作为单一原料的供应地。
    巴基斯坦人民经过长期的反对殖民主义的斗争，在1947年取得了独立地位之后，对于发展国民经济作了很多的努力。
    从1951年开始，巴基斯坦政府宣布实行一个“六年经济建设”的计划，目的是要改善农业灌溉和交通运输，同时发展工业。根据国会的一项法案，1952年1月成立了“巴基斯坦工业发展公司”，由国家投资并吸收部分私人资本和外资来统筹工业建设事项。到1955年为止的四年中，这个公司已建立了投资共三亿三千七百万卢比的十六项工业建设工程，另有投资共约四亿卢比的十七项工程，将在1956—1957年度投入生产。
    由于这些工业的建立，过去几乎全部工业品都需要从国外输入的巴基斯坦，现在已有某些轻工业品能够自给了。发展较快的是纺织工业。1948年全国只有十七万余枚纱锭和四千八百多台织布机，1955年已发展到纱锭一百五十万枚以上和织布机二万三千台。粗级和中级棉织品已能满足国内市场需要。盛产黄麻的巴基斯坦原来没有制麻工业，独立后建立了共有六千架织麻机的制麻工厂，已有部分麻制品出口。其他如制造纸张、火柴、纸烟、糖、水泥和某些化学产品的工业也有发展。喀喇蚩造船厂已完成第一期工程。独立时全国发电厂的发电能力为七万五千瓩，1955年已增至十八万瓩。
    最近，巴基斯坦政府正在拟订新的五年发展计划。这个计划的投资总额约五十余亿卢比，其中约二分之一用于水利和发电。总投资的半数将依靠外援和外债。计划中包括筹建一个年产钢三十万吨的钢铁厂和在东巴基斯坦的卡尔纳福里修建一个发电八万至十六万瓩和防洪、灌溉的综合水利工程。
    但是，巴基斯坦发展工业的道路并不是平坦的。它的某些重要经济部门还受到外国资本的操纵和外国商品的排挤，他们不愿意巴基斯坦建立民族工业。某些西方国家并以“援助”名义，使巴基斯坦接受不利的条件和把可贵的资金大量用于增加军备。巴基斯坦1956—57年度的预算案表明，它的军事费用占全部支出的70％。
    农业在巴基斯坦国民经济中占有90％的比重。主要作物是稻米、小麦、棉花和黄麻。最近几年，巴基斯坦曾以很大努力来发展灌溉事业和扩大耕作面积。种稻面积扩大了约20％，已达到将近一千万公顷。小麦每年播种四百万公顷左右。在丰收的1953—1954年度，大米、小麦产量达到一千二百多万吨，比独立后的第一年（1947—1948年度）增加了将近20％。杂粮的产量也有增长。但巴基斯坦的耕地约三分之二以上为地主所有，束缚着生产力的发展。自然灾害也常有发生。最近两年的水灾，粮食减产约10％。
    黄麻和棉花是巴基斯坦最重要的经济作物。它每年的外汇收入，80％以上是由输出黄麻和棉花得来的。因此，棉麻对巴基斯坦的国民生活，国家的财政收入和建设资金，都有重大的关系。棉麻的生产和销售，是巴基斯坦政府和人民所重视的。在1951年前后，巴基斯坦黄麻和棉花的输出值曾达二十亿卢比以上，黄麻产量最多曾达一百二十万吨，棉花达三十万吨以上。可是，近几年来，巴基斯坦的黄麻、棉花的出口价格和销路都受了很大的不利影响，它甚至在自己棉花销售不畅的时候被迫接受外国的剩余棉花。在最近两个年度，巴基斯坦的棉麻出口总价，降到每年只有十亿卢比左右，黄麻产量降为四十余万吨，棉花二十余万吨。这给巴基斯坦的财政经济造成很大困难。
    几年来，巴基斯坦为了平衡对外贸易，实行限制入口和鼓励棉麻出口的政策，并努力发展同一些国家的贸易关系。我国和巴基斯坦从1950年起就有相当数量的贸易来往，1953年两国曾签订互换棉花和煤的贸易协定。1952年和1955年我国两次参加了巴基斯坦举行的国际工业展览会。我国是购买巴基斯坦棉花最多的国家之一，曾一度中断的黄麻贸易最近也有恢复，我国并开始有某些钢铁制品等卖给巴基斯坦。
    苏联和巴基斯坦也有着发展贸易和经济合作关系的愿望。今年二月，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在答巴基斯坦统一通讯社记者问时说，苏联和巴基斯坦两国之间的互利的经济合作具有充分的可能性。苏联可以购买巴基斯坦的农产品、畜牧产品以及巴基斯坦需要出售的其他商品，可以卖给巴基斯坦全套的工业设备、各种机械和其他巴基斯坦所需要的商品。通过联合国技术援助基金，苏联最近已把一些技术装备运交巴基斯坦。这些措施受到了巴基斯坦舆论热烈的欢迎，巴基斯坦政府并宣布将和苏联进行贸易谈判。巴基斯坦同波兰在今年二月六日签订了一项贸易协定，同捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利等国也在进行发展贸易关系的接触。巴基斯坦同印度的传统的贸易关系，近年来在重新发展。毫无疑问，巴基斯坦同更多的国家在平等互利的基础上发展贸易和经济合作关系，将有助于它稳定和扩大出口商品的市场，取得进行经济建设所需的技术装备。这对于巴基斯坦发展国民经济、巩固独立地位和增进它和各国的友好关系，都是有所裨益的。fs
