    In Jiangxi and Fujian 
    People's Air Force Shoots Down Two Chiang Kai-shek Planes
    Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd – Before dawn today, at 1:06 AM, a Chiang Kai-shek bomber intruded into the airspace over the Shangrao area of Jiangxi Province and was hit by accurate and fierce fire from a Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force plane. The Chiang Kai-shek plane caught fire after being hit and, like a ball of fire, streaked across the night sky and crashed into a mountain gully in Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province.
    Also, on the 20th, at 12:02 PM, four Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter planes intruded into the airspace over the Pinghai area of Fujian Province. A Chinese People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery unit shot down one of them with fierce artillery fire.
