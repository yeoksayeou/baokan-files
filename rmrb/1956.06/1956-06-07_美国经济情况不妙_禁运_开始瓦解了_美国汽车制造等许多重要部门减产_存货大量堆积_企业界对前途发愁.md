Xinhua News Agency, New York: Production activities in many important sectors of American enterprises are beginning to decline. A United Press dispatch on May 24 said that the American business community is currently more worried about the future of the economy than it has been in the past few months. It said: "In the view of many experts, the upward phase of American economic prosperity has definitely passed."

According to figures released by the Federal Reserve System Administration, the U.S. industrial production index fell from 143 in January and February this year to 142 in March and April (the 1947-49 index is 100). Last year, the industrial production index rose continuously and reached an unprecedented peak of 144 in December.

The most serious decline in production is in the automotive industry. Ford Motor Company boss Ford said at a recent shareholders' meeting that U.S. automobile production this year will decrease from 7.4 million vehicles last year to less than 6 million vehicles. In fact, automobile production from January to May this year has already decreased by 25% compared to the same period last year.

According to United Press, the sluggishness of the automotive industry has continuously weakened the demand for rubber, steel, glass, and many other raw materials. The current operating rate of the steel industry is only 96%, while it was 99% in the first quarter of this year.

Production is also declining in sectors such as the hardware industry, household goods manufacturing, agricultural machinery manufacturing, transportation equipment manufacturing, electrical machinery manufacturing, the textile industry, and the coal mining industry. In the coal mining sector, more than 150,000 out of 400,000 workers are unemployed.

In explaining the phenomenon of the economy beginning to decline, the American press believes that this is because some important factors that created the temporary "prosperity" of the American economy are gradually losing their effect. For example, the inflationary policy adopted by the U.S. government to stimulate the economy has already brought about adverse consequences. The automotive and construction industries (two major pillars of the U.S. economy), which rely on installment purchases and mortgages to maintain sales, have already experienced surpluses. Consumers are reducing their purchases because they are burdened with heavy debts. As prices rise, unsold inventories are piling up in large quantities.

Many prominent American business figures have made pessimistic predictions. At a recent meeting in Hot Springs, Virginia, the 100 leading industrialists and financiers who make up the government's business advisory committee determined that a business recession will occur in the third quarter of this year. National Association of Manufacturers Executive Secretary Rennard said at a meeting attended by 2,700 store managers: "I don't think a new depression will happen tomorrow, or this year, but it is definitely going to happen."

### 美国经济情况不妙“禁运”开始瓦解了  美国汽车制造等许多重要部门减产  存货大量堆积　企业界对前途发愁

    美国经济情况不妙“禁运”开始瓦解了
    美国汽车制造等许多重要部门减产
    存货大量堆积　企业界对前途发愁
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：美国许多重要企业部门的生产活动正在开始下降。合众社五月二十四日的一条消息说，美国企业界目前对经济的前途比过去几个月更加忧虑。它说：“在许多专家看来，美国经济繁荣的上升阶段已经肯定地过去了。”
    根据联邦储备系统管理局发表的数字，美国工业生产指数从今年一、二月份的143下降到三、四月份的142（1947—49年的指数为一百）。而在去年，工业生产指数曾经连续上涨，并且在十二月份达到144的空前高峰。
    生产下跌最严重的是汽车制造业。福特汽车公司老板福特最近在一个股东年会上说，美国汽车生产今年将要从去年的七百四十万辆减少到不到六百万辆。而实际上，今年一月份到五月份的汽车生产已经比去年同时期减少了25％。
    据合众社说，汽车业的不景气使得对橡胶、钢铁、玻璃和其他许多原料的需求不断减弱。钢铁业目前的开工率只有96％，而今年第一季是99％。
    五金业、家庭用品制造业、农业机器制造业、运输设备制造业、电力机器制造业、纺织工业和煤矿工业等等部门的生产也都在下降。在煤矿业部门，四十万工人当中就有十五万以上的工人失业。
    在解释经济开始走下坡路的现象时，美国报刊认为，这是由于造成美国经济的暂时“繁荣”的一些重要因素正在逐渐失去作用。例如，美国政府为了刺激经济而采取的通货膨胀政策已经带来了不良的后果。靠着分期付款赊购和抵押贷款来维持销路的汽车业和建筑业（美国经济的两大支柱）已经出现了过剩的现象，消费者们由于承担了沉重的债务，正在减少他们的购买。随着物价上涨，企业卖不出去的存货已在大量堆积起来。
    许多有地位的美国企业界人物都作出了悲观的预测。在最近弗吉尼亚州温泉县举行的会议上，组成政府的企业顾问委员会的一百名主要的工业家和金融家断定，今年第三季将要发生企业衰退。全国制造商协会执行秘书雷纳德在一个有两千七百名商店负责人的会议上说：“我并不认为新的萧条将在明天发生，或者在今年发生，但是它却是肯定地将要发生的。”
