    Soviet Jet Passenger Plane Arrives in Prague
    (Our dispatch from Moscow, June 16th) A "Ty-104" jet passenger plane flew from Moscow to Prague at 12:00 noon (Moscow time) yesterday. The plane traveled 1,840 kilometers at an altitude of 10,000 meters, and the entire journey from take-off to landing took only two hours and thirty minutes, shortening the flight time by four hours and thirty minutes compared to the "Il-12" and "Il-14" passenger planes that previously flew on this route.
    The plane was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Czechoslovakia when it landed at Prague Airport. It is reported that in addition to regular jet passenger flights between Moscow and Prague, the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration has also decided that the "Ty-104" jet passenger plane will soon fly on other international routes.

    苏喷气客机到布拉格
    本报莫斯科16日电　昨天中午十二时（莫斯科时间），一架“ту—104”式喷气客机从莫斯科飞到了布拉格。这架客机在一万公尺高空中经过了一千八百四十公里的航程，从起飞到着陆，一共只用了两小时三十分钟，比原来在该航线上飞行过的“ил—12”及“ил—14”式客机的飞行时间缩短了四小时三十分钟。
    这架飞机在布拉格机场着陆时，受到了捷克斯洛伐克各界人民的热烈欢迎。据悉：除了莫斯科和布拉格之间将有喷气式客机的经常飞行外，苏联民用航空局还决定在不久以后，“ту—104”式喷气客机，就要在其他国际航线上飞行。
