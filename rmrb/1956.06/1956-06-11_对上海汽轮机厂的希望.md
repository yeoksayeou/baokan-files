Hopes for the Shanghai Turbine Factory
Lu Xingfu, Dispatcher, Production Section, Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant

The state has designated our plant, the Shanghai Turbine Factory, and the Shanghai Boiler Factory to jointly manufacture the complete set of equipment for the 6,000 kW turbo-generator, a key product in the First Five-Year Plan. Our plant is responsible for manufacturing the 6,000 kW generator, for which a material called aluminum bronze slot wedge is to be supplied by the Shanghai Turbine Factory. The Shanghai Turbine Factory successfully trial-produced this material in June of last year, and signed the first batch of contracts with our plant in September, stipulating delivery in November of last year. Later, several more contracts, witnessed by the higher-level bureaus of both parties, were signed, stipulating delivery in the first and second quarters of this year respectively. However, the Shanghai Turbine Factory has delivered less than a quarter of the first batch of contracts to date. Consequently, our plant's plan to put the 6,000 kW generator into storage in June cannot proceed due to the lack of aluminum bronze slot wedge material, leaving the entire turbo-generator workshop in a state of semi-shutdown, and the second-quarter plan is also on the verge of being unfulfilled.

The Shanghai Turbine Factory's delayed delivery is due to their prioritizing the production of the 6,000 kW turbine they are responsible for, while neglecting collaborative tasks. Yu Tongchen, the head of the production section of the factory, once instructed the production section: "Only solve the first batch of contracts. The many contracts signed later need to be reconsidered (meaning shirking responsibility and ignoring them)." The reason given was that the technical level did not meet the requirements.

Is it really that the technical level of the Shanghai Turbine Factory does not meet the requirements? No, it is not. They were able to successfully trial-produce the aluminum bronze slot wedge in June of last year, and the test results fully met the requirements. If it is said that the task is urgent, these contracts were already signed last year. They should have, and were required to, calculate them into their annual plan this year, so why are they now disregarding them?

Our plant has expended great effort on the aluminum bronze slot wedge issue in order to fulfill the state plan: the factory director personally visited the turbine factory director, the trade union helped to do mobilization work, the workers' representative assembly sought assistance from them, and the supervisory office contacted their supervisory office. We also unconditionally repaired copper ingot molds for them. From January 27th to May 18th this year alone, relevant comrades from our plant visited their factory as many as 48 times. Despite this, the problem remains unresolved today.

Fulfilling the state's First Five-Year Plan is the common sacred duty of the people of the whole country. If we fail to complete the production task of the 6,000 kW generator, even if the Shanghai Turbine Factory overfulfills the task of the 6,000 kW turbine, a complete set of turbo-generators cannot be assembled. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai Turbine Factory will regard the production of aluminum bronze slot wedges as its own task, immediately take measures, and supply them to us as soon as possible. At the same time, we also request the support of higher-level leading organs to help us overcome difficulties.

### 对上海汽轮机厂的希望

    对上海汽轮机厂的希望
    上海电机厂生产科调度员　陆幸福
    第一个五年计划中的重要产品六千瓩汽轮发电机的全套设备，国家规定由我厂和上海汽轮机厂、上海锅炉厂联合制造。我厂负责制造的六千瓩发电机，其中有一种机件材料——铝青铜槽楔，是由上海汽轮机厂负责供给的。去年六月份，上海汽轮机厂已经把这种材料试制成功，九月份同我厂订立了第一批合同，规定去年十一月交货；后来又先后订立了由双方上级局见证的合同好几张，规定分别在今年一、二季交货。可是，上海汽轮机厂直到今天所交的货，还不到第一批合同的四分之一，因此，我厂计划在六月份入库的六千瓩发电机因没有铝青铜槽楔材料，不能继续加工，整个的汽轮发电机车间陷于半停工状态，第二季计划也眼看就要完不成。
    上海汽轮机厂的脱期交货，是由于他们只重视自己担负的六千瓩汽轮机的生产，忽视协作任务。这个厂生产科科长于同尘曾这样向生产科指示：
  “只解决第一批合同。后来订的许多合同，需重新考虑（意思是推却责任不管）。”理由是技术水平达不到要求。
    真的是上海汽轮机厂技术水平达不到要求吗？不是的。他们在去年六月份能够把铝青铜槽楔试制成功，而且试验结果完全合乎要求。要说任务紧吧，但是这些合同早在去年就已经订好了，他们在编今年的年度计划的时候本来是应该而且必须计算进去的，为什么又不算数了呢？
    我厂为了完成国家计划，曾为铝青铜槽楔事花了很大力量：厂长亲自去拜访汽轮机厂厂长，工会去帮助做鼓动工作，职工代表大会向他们求援，监察室同他们监察室联系过；我们也曾无条件地替他们修理浇铜锭模子。仅从今年一月二十七日至五月十八日，我厂有关同志到他们厂里去的就有四十八人次之多。虽然如此，但是问题直到今天还是得不到解决。
    完成国家第一个五年计划是全国人民共同的神圣职责，如果我们完不成六千瓩发电机的生产任务，即使上海汽轮机厂超额完成了六千瓩汽轮机的任务，同样还是装配不成成套的汽轮发电机。因此我们希望上海汽轮机厂把生产铝青铜槽楔也看做自己的任务，立即采取措施，尽快地供应给我们。同时也要求上级领导机关支持我们，帮助我们克服困难。
