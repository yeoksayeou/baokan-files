Shanxi Province’s middle schools and teacher training schools have begun to emphasize providing students with basic production technology education. Many schools have formulated implementation plans for carrying out basic production technology education.

　　Taiyuan Fifth Middle School spent 3,110 yuan to purchase various instruments and teaching aids to strengthen classroom teaching experiments, and another 800 yuan to purchase woodworking and fitter tools. Linfen First Middle School spent 1,200 yuan to purchase woodworking and fitter tools. According to very incomplete statistics, 34 middle schools and teacher training schools in the province have established agricultural experimental plots and set up simple agricultural production tools. Nine schools have established small practice factories or craft rooms. Eight schools have established zoos, raising chickens, rabbits, sheep, pigs, and bees. Some schools with better foundations have also contacted local factories and agricultural cooperatives to carry out production visits and production internships.

　　In order to enhance basic production technology education, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education recently allocated 150,000 yuan in special funds as equipment expenses necessary for schools to carry out basic production technology education.

    山西各中学和师范学校开始重视生产技术教育
    本报讯　山西省各中学和师范学校开始重视对学生进行基本生产技术教育。不少学校制定了实施基本生产技术教育的实施计划。
    太原第五中学以三千一百一十元，购置了各种仪器和教具，加强了课堂教学实验，又以八百元购置了木工，钳工工具。临汾第一中学以一千二百元购置木工、钳工工具。据极不完全的统计，全省已有三十四所中学和师范学校建立了农业实验园地，并设置了简单的农业生产工具。有九所学校建立了小型实习工厂或工艺室。有八所学校建立了动物园，饲养小鸡、小兔、小羊、小猪和蜜蜂等。个别基础较好的学校还和当地工厂、农业合作社联系，进行了生产参观和生产实习。
    山西省教育厅为了增强基本生产技术教育，最近已拨十五万元专款，作为各校进行基本生产技术教育所必需的设备费用。
