Strange "Discovery"
　　
　　There are all kinds of travelers in the world, and they have all kinds of discoveries. But no one has ever heard of a "traveler" who can "discover" land that "should" belong to him on the territory of another country.

　　Recently, a Philippine "traveler" named Cloma announced such a strange "discovery." He actually "discovered" many islands in the Nansha Islands, which have always belonged to China, in the South China Sea. Then, he planted coconut trees and vegetables on these islands, and posted notices declaring that these islands belonged to the Philippines. Then, Philippine government officials came out and said that these islands "should" belong to the Philippines.

　　The Philippine authorities also admit that these islands are "not within the territory of the Philippines," so what is the basis for occupying these islands? They "discovered" a reason, which is that the location of these islands seems to be a bit special, they are "closest" to the Philippines.

　　Indeed, China's Nansha Islands are closest to the Philippines. But does this become a reason for the Philippines to occupy these islands? If this "reason" is valid, then we can also say that the Philippine Islands are closest to China, wouldn't China also be able to arbitrarily occupy the Philippine Islands?

　　In fact, Cloma and the Philippine authorities themselves understand that they cannot invade other people's territory by relying on a fabricated fairy tale, a few coconut trees, and some vegetables. The reason they are acting recklessly is because they feel they have a backer. Recently, Cloma openly said that he "determined" that "Communist China is not capable of extending its supply line so far, especially because of the (American) Seventh Fleet nearby." This is the real reason why they are invading China's Nansha Islands.

　　If you look at the United States' reaction and activities to this matter, it is not difficult to understand the full content of this fairy tale. On May 26, "The New York Times" wrote, "An enterprising" Filipino is claiming ownership of the Nansha Islands... "The location of these islands is strategically important," therefore, "It is not unreasonable for these islands to belong to the Philippines." At the same time, the United States is trying to turn this incident of infringing on China's territorial sovereignty into a so-called "international dispute" between several countries in order to fish in troubled waters. In this situation, the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem Group even came out and shouted: The Nansha Islands "have always been part of Vietnam." Then the Associated Press reported that the United States would "be drawn into" this "international dispute."

　　Everyone knows that the United States, for "strategic" reasons, has "discovered" dozens of American military bases on Philippine territory and wants to occupy them forever. Now, it is supporting the Philippine authorities to occupy other people's territory for "strategic" reasons. People can fully see what the United States is up to.

　　In the history of the Philippines, it has never been an aggressor. On the contrary, the Philippine people have long suffered from foreign colonial rule and enslavement, and even today its sovereignty and land are still fragmented. All upright Philippine people know that what "should" belong to the Philippines is definitely not other people's territory, but all of the Philippines' own territory, including those bases occupied by the United States. What they are demanding is not to post Philippine notices on other people's land, but to post Philippine notices on those ancestral lands occupied by the United States....

　　The Nansha Islands are an inseparable part of China's sacred territory. No matter who, no matter what force, can absolutely not change this fact. The Chinese people will never allow anyone to infringe on our sovereignty. We also believe that the Philippine people will not allow anyone to do something illegal to tarnish the Philippines' reputation. Now is no longer 1492, those adventurers who attempt to "discover" new continents on other people's territory will get nothing but an ignominious failure.

    奇怪的“发现”
    崔奇
    世界上有各种各样的旅行家，他们有各种各样的发现。但是从来也没有人听说过这样一种“旅行家”，他可以在别的国家领土上“发现”“理应”属于自己的土地。
    最近一个叫做克洛马的菲律宾“旅行家”就宣布了这样一种奇怪的“发现”。他竟在南中国海“发现”了一向属于中国的南沙群岛的许多岛屿。接着，他在这些岛屿上种了椰子树和蔬菜，并且张贴了通告，宣布这些岛屿归菲律宾人所有。然后，菲律宾政府人士出来说，这些岛屿“理应”属于菲律宾。
    菲律宾当局也承认，这些岛屿“并不处在菲律宾的领土范围之内”，那末究竟凭什么占据这些岛屿呢？他们“发现”了一个理由，这就是：这些岛屿的位置似乎有点特别，它们距离菲律宾“最近”。
    的确，中国的南沙群岛距离菲律宾最近。但是，难道这就可以成为菲律宾占据这些岛屿的理由吗？如果这个“理由”可以成立，那末，我们同样可以说菲律宾群岛距离中国最近，中国岂不是也可以任意占据菲律宾群岛了吗？
    其实，克洛马和菲律宾当局自己也懂得，他们依靠一篇编造的童话，几棵椰子树，以及一些蔬菜，是不能够侵占别人的领土的。他们所以胡作非为，是因为他们感到自己有靠山。最近，克洛马公开说，他“断定”“共产党中国是没有能力把它的供应线延长到这么远的，特别是由于（美国）第七舰队在附近”。这就是他们侵占中国南沙群岛的真正理由。
    如果看一下美国对这件事情的反应和活动，就不难了解这篇童话的全部内容了。五月二十六日，“纽约时报”写道，“一个有进取心的”菲律宾人要求对南沙群岛的所有权……“这些岛屿的位置在战略上很重要”，因此，“这些岛屿要归于菲律宾也不是不合理”。同时，美国正想把这个侵犯中国领土主权的事件，变为所谓几个国家的“国际争执”，以便浑水摸鱼。在这种情况下，南越吴庭艳集团竟也出来叫喊：南沙群岛“一直是越南的一部分”。接着合众社就报道说，美国将“被卷入”这个“国际争执”中。
    谁都知道，美国为了“战略”的理由，曾经在菲律宾的国土上“发现”了几十处美国的军事基地，并且还要把它们永远据为己有。现在，它又在支持菲律宾当局，为了“战略”的理由，去占据别人的领土了。人们完全可以看出美国的居心何在。
    在菲律宾的历史上，它从来不是侵略者。相反，菲律宾人民长期遭受外国的殖民统治和奴役，而且至今它的主权和山河依然支离破碎。一切正直的菲律宾人民知道，“理应”属于菲律宾的决不是别人的领土，而是菲律宾自己的全部领土，包括那些被美国占据的基地在内。他们所要求的决不是到别人的土地上去张贴菲律宾人的通告，而是要求在那些被美国占领的祖国土地上张贴起菲律宾人的通告……。
    南沙群岛是中国的神圣领土的一部分。不论任何人，不论任何力量，绝对不能改变这个事实。中国人民决不容许别人侵犯我们的主权。我们并且相信，菲律宾人民也不会容许有人干一种非法的事情来败坏菲律宾的名誉。现在已经不是1492年了，那些企图到别人的领土上“发现”新大陆的冒险家们，除了遭到不体面的失败以外，是什么也得不到的。
