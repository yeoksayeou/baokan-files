Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 31st. The Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan held its opening performance at the "Kabukiza" in Tokyo on the evening of May 30th. This powerful Chinese Peking Opera troupe captivated the Japanese audience from the very beginning with its outstanding performance.

    Mei Lanfang, the head of the Peking Opera troupe, performed his signature piece, "The Drunken Concubine," last night. His delicate performing art and melodious singing attracted the attention of the entire audience at every moment. When the performance ended, the three to four thousand spectators who filled the four-story Kabukiza building responded with enthusiastic and lengthy applause. Many people rushed to the stage to present flowers to Mei Lanfang.

    The Chinese Peking Opera troupe also performed "The Reconciliation of General and Prime Minister," "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," and "San Cha Kou" for the Japanese audience last night. Each program received multiple curtain calls after its completion. The audience showed particular interest in "San Cha Kou," performed by Li Shaochun and Gu Chunzhang.

    The enthusiasm of the Japanese audience was so high that several hundred people lined up at the theater entrance two hours before the opening last night, waiting for the doors to open. After the opening, in addition to the 2,500 seats being immediately filled, more than a thousand people were standing to watch the performance.

    Many famous figures from the Japanese theater and art circles came to watch the opening performance of the Chinese Peking Opera troupe. Among them were Yasunari Kawabata, Hakucho Masamune, Osaragi Jiro, Ryuzaburo Umehara, Ennosuke Ichikawa, and Koreya Senda. Tetsu Katayama, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Mozaburo Suzuki, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, and S.L. Tikhvinsky, head of the Soviet delegation in Tokyo, also came to see the performance.

    The Japanese theater community gave a high evaluation of the Chinese Peking Opera troupe's performance. Theater critics unanimously praised the performance as "exceptionally outstanding." They pointed out that the Japanese could learn a lot from the Chinese in performing Japanese classical dramas such as "Noh" and "Kabuki." The Japanese theater and cultural communities have designated May 31st and June 1st as "Theater Viewing Days" and are preparing to collectively appreciate the performances of the Chinese Peking Opera troupe.

    Before the performance last night, an opening ceremony was also held. Iwao Shiraishi, representative of the "Asahi Shimbun" company, which invited the Chinese Peking Opera troupe to Japan for a performance tour, said at the opening ceremony: Mr. Mei Lanfang's leadership of such an excellent and grand troupe to perform in Japan represents the profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people.

    He added that this Chinese traditional art, which has great honor, is full of the spirit of the Chinese nation. Through this performance, the hearts of our two peoples are closely linked together.

    Next, Ouyang Yuqian, first deputy head and general director of the Chinese Peking Opera troupe, expressed his heartfelt thanks to the hosts for their warm reception on behalf of the Peking Opera troupe, and conveyed the warm greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to the citizens of Tokyo and the Japanese people.

    Ouyang Yuqian said: The people of China and Japan have deepened their mutual understanding and friendship through mutual appreciation of art.

    Finally, Mei Lanfang, Ouyang Yuqian and other leaders of the Peking Opera troupe received flowers presented by representatives from all sectors and groups in Japan and representatives of overseas Chinese in Japan on the stage.

    我国京剧团在东京首次演出盛况
    新华社东京31日电　中国访日京剧代表团五月三十日晚上在东京“歌舞伎座”举行了开幕演出。这个阵容强大的中国京剧团一开始就以它的优秀的演出迷住了日本的观众。
    京剧团团长梅兰芳昨天晚上演出了他的拿手戏“贵妃醉酒”。他的细腻的表演艺术和悦耳的歌声，每一时刻都吸引着全体观众的注意。当演出结束时，挤满了歌舞伎座这个四层大楼的三、四千名观众，报以热烈的长时间的掌声。许多人赶上台去向梅兰芳献花。
    中国京剧团昨天晚上还为日本观众演出了“将相和”、“拾玉镯”和“三岔口”。每个节目演完后，都谢幕多次。观众特别对李少春和谷春章演出的“三岔口”表现出极大的兴趣。
    日本观众的热情是如此的高涨，在昨晚开场前两个钟头就有好几百人在戏院门口排着长队等候开门。开场后，除了二千五百个座位立即都坐满了以外，还有一千多个人在站着看戏。
      日本许多著名的戏剧界和文艺界人士都来观看中国京剧团的开幕演出。他们当中包括川端康成、正宗白鸟、大佛次郎、梅原龙三郎、市川猿之助、千田是也。日中文化交流协会会长片山哲、日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎、苏联驻东京代表团团长季契温斯基等人也前来看戏。
    日本戏剧界对中国京剧团的演出给予很高的评价。戏剧评论家们一致称赞这次演出是“卓越绝顶”。他们指出，日本人在表演日本的古典戏剧——“能乐”和“歌舞伎”方面可以从中国人学到很多东西。日本戏剧界和文化界人士已经把五月三十一日和六月一日定为“观剧日”，准备集体欣赏中国京剧团的演出。
    昨天晚上在演出以前，还举行了开幕式。邀请中国京剧团到日本进行访问演出的“朝日新闻”社的代表白石嵓在开幕式上致词说：这次梅兰芳先生率领这样优秀盛大的剧团前来日本演出，表示中国人民对日本人民的深厚友谊。
    他又说，这一个有莫大荣誉的中国传统艺术充满着中华民族的精神。通过这次演出，我们两国人民的心紧密地连在一起了。
    接着，中国京剧团第一副团长兼总导演欧阳予倩代表京剧团向主人的热烈的接待表示衷心的感谢，并且向东京市民和日本人民转达中国人民的热烈问候和最好的愿望。
    欧阳予倩说：中日两国人民通过互相欣赏艺术加深了相互的了解和友谊。
    最后，梅兰芳、欧阳予倩等京剧团的领导人员在舞台上接受了日本各界各团体和旅日华侨代表的献花。
