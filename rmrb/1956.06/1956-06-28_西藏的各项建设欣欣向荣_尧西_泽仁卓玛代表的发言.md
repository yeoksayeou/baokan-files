    I have listened to the report by Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian "On the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget," the explanation by Minister Liao Luyan "On the Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," and the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress" delivered by Peng 真, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, on behalf of the Standing Committee. Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report illustrates the increasingly prosperous and stable national financial and economic situation and the rapid development of the country's various construction undertakings, which is worthy of celebration. I personally express my complete agreement and support.
    Fellow representatives, as someone engaged in women's work, please allow me to briefly introduce the women's work in Tibet.
    Before liberation, Tibetan women had no political, economic, cultural, or educational rights or status. The lives of the vast majority of women were tragic, and the child mortality rate was alarming. Women never had any opportunity to inquire about national affairs, let alone participate in various social activities, which kept them confined to the small circles of their families for a long time. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the close unity and direct leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army and personnel stationed in Tibet, all aspects of Tibet's construction are thriving and developing. Taking transportation as an example, it is very obvious. In the past, when we came to the interior of the motherland, we rode horses, which took three months. Now, Tibet not only has highways where cars can travel at any time, but it is also accessible by air, and it only takes three hours to reach the interior, thus changing the face of inconvenient transportation and poverty and backwardness. With the gradual progress and development of the entire society, the situation of the vast number of women in Tibet has also changed. They have begun to step out of the dark and narrow circles of their families. Now, Tibetan women are also organized and have established the Patriotic Women's Federation, which provides women with opportunities for learning and work, and allows them to participate in various festivals and social activities, and to go to the countryside at any time to carry out various anti-imperialist and patriotic propaganda and education work. In terms of production, Tibetan women are participating in agricultural and pastoral production just like men, and there are now female tractor drivers. In Lhasa, Shigatse, Qamdo, Gyantse and other places, many women are engaged in cultural, educational, health and other work. In political life, Tibetan women also participate as representatives to the National People's Congress, and there are also women's quotas on the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. In this way, Tibetan women have begun to enjoy equal rights between men and women, and the past situation is gradually changing.
    The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in April this year marks the beginning of a new historical stage in the development of the Tibetan people. This is a great happy event for the Tibetan people, and our Tibetan women compatriots feel extremely excited and encouraged. There is no doubt that the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has opened up broad prospects for Tibetan women to participate in the construction of a happy and fulfilling life, thereby enabling women compatriots to gradually achieve de facto equal rights between men and women. In the future, we must resolutely support and implement the various resolutions of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, actively participate in the subsequent democratic reforms and the various construction undertakings of socialist transformation, give full play to our high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and strive to build the socialist cause of the motherland.
    In order to celebrate the official establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government specially dispatched a central delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi, composed of 17 fraternal ethnic groups and various democratic parties, to Tibet to give us many valuable instructions in all aspects of our work. In the central delegation, women representatives from many advanced fraternal ethnic groups gave us Tibetan women's work great care, help, and guidance, which boosted our confidence and strengthened our work. In the future, we must not only study hard and work actively, but also give full play to our high degree of patriotism, further enhance our patriotic thinking, and stand at the forefront of opposing war and defending world peace, and strive to ensure the happy life of women and children. This is also the responsibility that we women should fulfill. Tibetan women are all devout Buddhists, so we must work together with women compatriots of all ethnic groups across the country to maintain world peace and contribute our strength to the peaceful construction of the motherland.
    Finally, please allow me to express my respect and gratitude to the Party and the government and to our beloved great leader Chairman Mao on behalf of Tibetan women and children, and wish all the representatives good health.

    西藏的各项建设欣欣向荣
    ——尧西·泽仁卓玛代表的发言
    我听了李先念副总理兼财政部长“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”和廖鲁言部长“关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明”及全国人民代表大会常务委员会彭真副委员长兼秘书长代表常务委员会作了“全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告”。李先念副总理的报告说明了国家财政经济状况的日趋繁荣稳定和国家各项建设事业突飞猛进的发展，是值得庆贺的，我个人表示完全同意和支持。
    各位代表，我自己是从事妇女工作的一份子，请允许我把西藏妇女工作，向大家简单介绍一下。
    西藏在未解放以前妇女们在政治上、经济上、文化教育上是没有丝毫的权利和地位的，广大妇女的生活是悲惨的，儿童的死亡率是惊人的，妇女们从来没有任何机会去过问国家大事，更谈不到从事于参加各种社会活动，使妇女们长期圈在家庭的小圈子里。自从1951年西藏和平解放以后，几年来，在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼亲密团结和直接领导下，在进藏的人民解放军和工作人员的帮助下，西藏的各项建设事业都在欣欣向荣向前发展着。从交通运输这一个问题上来看是非常明显的，过去我们到祖国内地来是骑马，时间得三个月，而如今西藏不但有了公路，汽车可以随时驰行，而且现在已通航了，时间有三个小时，即可到了内地，从而交通不便和贫穷落后的面貌正在起着变化。随着整个社会的逐渐进步发展，西藏广大妇女界的处境，也因此起了变化，她们已开始从灰暗而狭窄的家庭圈子里走出来了。如今西藏的妇女们也组织起来了，成立了爱国妇女联谊会，从而妇女们有了学习、工作的机会，参加了各种节日和社会活动，并随时下乡，进行各种反帝爱国的宣传教育工作。在生产上西藏妇女正与男子一样参加农牧业的生产，并出现了女拖拉机手，现在拉萨、日喀则、昌都、江孜等地不少妇女参加文教、卫生等工作。在政治生活中全国人民代表大会代表也有西藏的妇女参加，西藏自治区筹备委员会委员也有妇女的名额。这样西藏妇女已开始享受了男女平等权利，过去的状态正在逐渐改变中。
    今年4月成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，这就标志着西藏民族向前发展的新的历史阶段的开始，这是西藏人民的一件大喜事，我们西藏的妇女同胞们，更感到莫大的兴奋和鼓舞。毫无疑义的，西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，开辟了西藏妇女参加建设美满幸福生活的宽广前途，从而使妇女同胞逐步取得事实上的男女平等的权利。今后我们要坚决拥护和执行西藏自治区筹备委员会的各项决议，积极参加以后的各项民主改革工作和社会主义改造的各项建设事业，发挥高度的积极性和创造性，为建设祖国社会主义事业而奋斗。
    为了祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会的正式成立，中共中央和中央人民政府特派了陈毅副总理为首的，包括17个兄弟民族和各民主党派组成的中央代表团到西藏给我们各方面工作，作了很多宝贵的指示。在中央代表团中，许多先进兄弟民族的妇女代表，给我们西藏的妇女工作，曾以极大的关怀、帮助和教导我们，鼓舞了我们工作的信心，增强了我们工作的力量，——今后我们不但要努力学习，积极工作，而且我们要发挥高度的爱国主义精神，进一步提高爱国主义思想，我们要站在反对战争、保卫世界和平的最前线，为保障妇女和儿童的幸福生活而努力。这也是我们妇女应尽的责任，我们西藏的妇女都是笃诚的佛教徒，因此我们要与全国各族人民的妇女同胞一齐为维护世界和平而努力，为祖国的和平建设而贡献出自己的力量。
    最后，请允许我代表西藏妇女和儿童向党和政府及我们各族人民亲爱的伟大领袖毛主席表示敬意和感谢，并祝福各位代表健康。
