Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 21st: The Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China tried the cases of former Japanese military and political personnel Hiroshi Shirono and eight other war criminals in Taiyuan City from June 12th to 20th.

The eight war criminals are: Hiroshi Shirono, Advisor to the Puppet Shanxi Provincial Government, Lieutenant General of the Yan Xishan Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Training Corps, and Chief of the Political Work Department (Section); Keiji Sagaraku, former Captain and Battalion Commander of the 9th Battalion of the Independent Mixed 3rd Brigade of the Japanese Army, Major General and Regiment Commander of the Yan Xishan Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Training Corps; Shuichi Kikuchi, former Captain and Battalion Commander of the Independent Artillery Battalion of the Independent Mixed 3rd Brigade of the Japanese Army, Major General and Artillery Regiment Commander of the Yan Xishan Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Training Corps; Hiroyuki Nagatomi, Guidance Officer of the Joint Headquarters of the Security Forces of Puppet Wenxi and Anyi Counties, Colonel and Regiment Commander of the Yan Xishan Provisional Independent 10th Corps; Yoshikazu Sumioka, former Captain and Company Commander of the 244th Battalion of the Independent Infantry 14th Brigade of the Japanese Army, Colonel and Regiment Commander of the Yan Xishan Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Training Corps; Taiji Ohno, Councillor of the Puppet Ying County Government of Datong Province, Lieutenant Colonel and Instructor of the Yan Xishan Second War Zone Artillery Training Group; Minoru Kasa, Advisor to the Puppet Huguan County Government of Shanxi Province, Major and Quartermaster Chief of the Yan Xishan Provisional Independent 10th Corps; and Hisakichi Jinno, Chief Guidance Officer of the Police Force Directly Under the Puppet Datong Provincial Government, Major and Intelligence Chief of the Yan Xishan Datong Security Headquarters Command.

After the court hearing, it was confirmed that all the defendants, during the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China, participated in the war of aggression against China in various capacities such as Japanese military and political officials, and were all war criminals who had committed serious crimes. After the Japanese surrender, they also committed the crime of organizing former Japanese soldiers within Chinese territory, conspiring to revive Japanese militarism, and participating in Yan Xishan's counter-revolutionary army to oppose the Chinese People's War of Liberation.

The Special Military Tribunal's court personnel included: Presiding Judge Zhu Yaotang, Judges Hao Shaoan and Senior Colonel Zhang Jian, State Prosecutor Chief Procurator Jing Zuguo, Procurators Senior Colonel Huang Zexiang, Lieutenant Colonel Guo Xuan, and Zhang Huanxin.

The defendants' defense lawyers were Ji Gongquan, Wang Keqin, Cui Yuhua, He Shiying, Huang Wenzhong, and Liang Zhenhuan.

More than 300 people from all walks of life in Taiyuan and representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were present to observe the proceedings.

The court opened at 8:30 a.m. on the 12th. The first to be interrogated was Keiji Sagaraku. The court investigation confirmed that Keiji Sagaraku had repeatedly ordered and personally directed his subordinates to kill peaceful Chinese residents and captured wounded soldiers of the anti-Japanese army during the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China. After Japan's surrender, Keiji Sagaraku also advocated revanchism, attempted to revive Japanese militarism, incited Japanese soldiers to join Yan Xishan's counter-revolutionary army, and led his troops to fight against the Chinese People's Liberation Army as Major General and Regiment Commander of the Yan Xishan Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Training Corps.

The second to be interrogated was Hiroshi Shirono, the participant and manipulator of the Japanese puppet regime in Shanxi Province, and the participant, planner and organizer of the Japanese invading army's "Residual Shanxi Movement."

During his tenure as advisor to the puppet Shanxi Provincial Government, Hiroshi Shirono participated in the formulation of the "Shanxi Provincial Administration Outline for the Thirty-Third Year of the Republic of China." The general policy of this administrative outline was to "concentrate the manpower and material resources of the entire province to support the Greater East Asia War and complete the mission of the Greater East Asia supply base." According to this policy, the defendant manipulated the puppet Shanxi Provincial Security Force, the Police Department, and the Communist Suppression Committee to expand the puppet Security Force and formed more than 20 joint defense zones aimed at eliminating the anti-Japanese base areas in various counties, "using Chinese to kill Chinese." The defendant also repeatedly instructed the puppet Tao Yin and county heads that the Security Force should dispatch more "sweeps," seize grain, and cooperate with the Japanese army in combat, and use this as the standard for performance evaluation. The defendant also masterminded and personally directed the provincial Security Brigade to carry out many "sweeps." The defendant's crimes were confirmed by the witnesses Zhao Rui, the deputy commander of the puppet Shanxi Provincial Security Force, and Niu Xintian, the commander of the puppet Ji Ning Tao Security Force, who were summoned to court.

Witnesses confirmed that after the Japanese surrender, the defendant masterminded and launched the "Residual Movement," inciting Japanese military and political personnel to stay in Shanxi. In September 1945, he and Kiyokazu Iwata, a staff officer of the First Army of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, met with Zhao Rui, Liang Xianwu, and Yan Xishan himself, representatives of Yan Xishan. They also formed the "Collaboration Society," a joint Yan-Japanese group to assist Yan Xishan in opposing the Communists. In the "Collaboration Society," on the one hand, he wrote the book "The Standpoint of the Japanese," which served as the theoretical basis for the "Residual Movement," inciting the revanchism of the Japanese people, and asking them to "endure hardship and humiliation for the sake of reviving the motherland and remain." On the other hand, he organized a large number of Japanese propagandists to carry out incitement in the Japanese army units and hospitals in Taiyuan, Yuci, Yangquan, Xinzhou, and Datong. Under the planning of the defendant and Kiyokazu Iwata, more than 5,000 former Japanese military and political personnel were gathered and formed the disguised invading armed force "Special Service Corps" in the spring of 1946, which was later renamed "Provisional Independent 10th Corps" and "Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Training Corps." The defendant personally served as the Lieutenant General of the Corps and Chief of the Political Work Department (Section). Until the liberation of Taiyuan on April 24, 1949, this unit was completely annihilated, and the defendant continued to participate in directing it to fight against the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Zhao Chengshou, who was then the commander of Yan Xishan's 7th Army Group, also testified in court. He described in detail the process by which the defendant Hiroshi Shirono masterminded, planned, and organized Japanese military and political personnel to form armed forces. He said that the defendant was very active and proactively engaged in this conspiracy. When inciting former Japanese military and political personnel to "remain," he adopted various means such as threats, inducements, and deception.

In order to further expand this disguised invading armed force, the defendant and Kiyokazu Iwata repeatedly suggested to Yan Xishan to recruit "volunteer soldiers" from Japan. In May 1948, the defendant personally drafted a plan to mobilize 500,000 "volunteer soldiers" from Japan to China and to establish a "Anti-Communist Political Affairs Bureau" and "implement a worldwide anti-Communist liberation movement." He repeatedly sent people back to Japan to conduct activities, and sent Hiroyuki Nagatomi and others to Shanghai and Beijing, attempting to establish liaison points with Japan and open up secret routes between China and Japan.

In addition, in October 1948, the defendant drafted a situation report and submitted a proposal to the Chiang Kai-shek National Defense Department to recruit 500 officers from Japan to China.

The court interrogated the defendants Hiroyuki Nagatomi and Shuichi Kikuchi. They had both commanded their subordinates to brutally kill our peaceful residents and prisoners of war during the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China. After the Japanese surrender, they both actively followed Hiroshi Shirono, inciting former Japanese military and political personnel to remain in Shanxi, join the counter-revolutionary army, and undermine the Chinese people's cause of liberation.

During his tenure as the head of the puppet Hengshui Town Intelligence Work Office in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, Hiroyuki Nagatomi used extremely cruel methods to torture Chinese peaceful residents, extorting intelligence, and personally directed and ordered his subordinates to kill more than 100 people. On October 7, 1943, in Ziqiang Village, Qinyuan County, he drove eleven women and children, including Dang Cuie, into a kiln and set it on fire. Dang Cuie, a woman in her sixties who survived the disaster, rushed from Qinyuan County to Taiyuan to accuse the defendant of his crimes.

Next, the court conducted a factual investigation into Taiji Ohno, Minoru Kasa, and Hisakichi Jinno. They were all direct manipulators of the puppet regime and puppet police, and were guilty of economic plunder, destruction of towns, and brutal suppression of peaceful residents. They also actively participated in the "Residual Movement" to revive Japanese militarism, inciting and organizing a large number of Japanese military and political personnel to join Yan Xishan's army. In 1936, when Taiji Ohno was in the puppet Manchukuo, he used cruel methods to torture the Chinese national heroine Zhao Yiman.

Finally, the court interrogated Yoshikazu Sumioka. Yoshikazu Sumioka participated in the atrocities of the Japanese invading army massacring our prisoners of war at the Taiyuan Racecourse outside Xiaodongmen twice in late July and early August 1942. In these two atrocities, more than 340 captured soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, including Yuan Lifu, male and female, were used as live targets for the "courage training" of new Japanese recruits.

In the face of conclusive witness testimony and material evidence, the defendants all pleaded guilty to the crimes they had committed.

Based on the defendants' admission of guilt and repentance, the lawyers requested the court to impose lenient sentences.

The court heard the final statements of the defendants. The first to speak was Hiroshi Shirono, who said: "I have committed serious crimes and am an unforgivable criminal, but the Chinese people have given me humanitarian treatment. I was completely wrong, I am indeed guilty, please give me severe punishment!"

Then Keiji Sagaraku said that from his bloody crimes, he understood that the path of war he had taken in the past was completely wrong. He not only caused endless disasters to the Chinese people, but also brought unbearable disasters to the Japanese people. "I will never take up aggressive weapons again, I swear to be a new person."

Shuichi Kikuchi, Hiroyuki Nagatomi, Yoshikazu Sumioka, Taiji Ohno, Minoru Kasa, and Hisakichi Jinno also unanimously confessed their guilt and repented in their final statements, expressing their willingness to accept the court's punishment.

The Special Military Tribunal adjourned on the 19th for deliberation and announced the sentences for the defendants at 2:30 p.m. on the 20th. The court sentenced Hiroshi Shirono to 18 years in prison, Keiji Sagaraku to 15 years in prison, Shuichi Kikuchi, Hiroyuki Nagatomi, and Taiji Ohno to 13 years in prison each, Yoshikazu Sumioka and Minoru Kasa to 11 years in prison each, and Hisakichi Jinno to 8 years in prison. The terms of imprisonment for each defendant shall be calculated from the date of the judgment, and the number of days of detention before the judgment shall be counted as one day of imprisonment.

    新华社太原21日电　中华人民共和国最高人民法院特别军事法庭于六月十二日到二十日在太原市审判了前日本军政人员城野宏等八名战争犯罪案件。
    这八名战争犯罪分子是：伪山西省政府顾问辅佐官、阎锡山太原绥靖公署教导总队少将总队附兼政工部（处）长城野宏，前日本陆军独立混成第三旅团第九大队大尉大队长、阎锡山太原绥靖公署教导总队少将团长相乐圭二，前日本陆军独立混成第三旅团独立炮兵大队大尉大队长、阎锡山太原绥靖公署教导总队少将炮兵团长菊地修一，伪闻喜县、安邑县保安队联队本部指导官、阎锡山暂编独立第十总队上校团长永富博之，前日本陆军独立步兵第十四旅团第二四四大队大尉中队长、阎锡山太原绥靖公署教导总队上校团长住冈义一，伪大同省应县县公署参事官、阎锡山第二战区炮兵集训团中校教官大野泰治，伪山西省壶关县政府顾问、阎锡山暂编独立第十总队少校军需事务长笠实，伪大同省公署直辖警察队首席指导官、阎锡山大同保安总队司令队少校情报主任神野久吉。
    法庭审理后确认：各被告人在日本帝国主义侵略中国的战争期间，分别以日本军政官吏等各种不同的身份，参加侵略中国的战争，都是犯有严重罪行的战争犯罪分子。日本投降后，又犯有在中国领土内组织前日本军人，阴谋复活日本军国主义，参加阎锡山反革命军队，反对中国人民解放战争的罪行。
    特别军事法庭出庭人员有：审判长朱耀堂、审判员郝绍安和军法上校张剑，国家公诉人首席检察员井助国、检察员军法大校黄泽湘、军法中校郭轩和张焕新。
    被告辩护人是律师冀贡泉、王克勤、崔玉华、何士英、黄文忠和梁振寰。
    到庭旁听的有太原市各界人士和中国人民解放军代表三百多人。
    法庭在十二日上午八时半开庭。首先审讯相乐圭二。庭审调查证实：相乐圭二在日本帝国主义侵略中国战争期间曾多次命令和亲自指挥部下杀害中国和平居民，俘虏抗日军队的伤员。日本投降后，相乐圭二又鼓吹复仇主义，妄图复活日本军国主义，煽动日本士兵参加阎锡山反革命军队，并以阎锡山太原绥靖公署教导总队少将团长等身份，率领所部对中国人民解放军作战。
    第二个被审讯的是山西省日伪政权的参与操纵者、日本侵略军“残留山西运动”的参与策划者和组织者城野宏。
    城野宏在担任伪山西省政府顾问辅佐官期间，曾参与制定了“民国三十三年度山西省施政大纲”，这个施政大纲的总方针是“集中全省人力、物力，支援大东亚战争，完成大东亚兵站基地使命”。按照这个方针，被告人操纵伪山西省保安队、警务厅和剿共委员会等机构，扩充伪保安队，并且组成了二十多个以消灭各县边区抗日根据地为目的的联防区，“以中国人杀中国人”；被告人并且多次向伪道尹、县长指示：保安队要多出动“扫荡”、抢粮和配合日军作战，并且以此作为考绩的标准。被告人还主谋策划和亲自指挥省直属保安大队进行了多次“扫荡”。被告人的罪行为被传到庭的伪山西省保安队副司令赵瑞、伪冀宁道保安队指挥牛新田等证人分别证实。
    证人证实：在日本投降以后，被告人主谋发动了煽动日本军政人员留在山西的“残留运动”。1945年9月，他和日本北支那派遣军第一军参谋岩田清一，先后会见了阎锡山的代表赵瑞、梁綖武和阎锡山本人。并且组成了协助阎锡山反共的日阎合组的“合谋社”。他在“合谋社”中一方面著作了作为“残留运动”理论基础的“日本人的立场”一书，煽动日人的复仇主义，要他们“卧薪尝胆，为了复兴祖国而残留”。一方面组织了大批日本宣传员分别在太原、榆次、阳泉、忻县、大同等地的日军部队、医院中进行煽动。在被告人和岩田清一等策划下，先后纠合了前日本军政人员五千多人，在1946年春组成了变相的侵略武装部队“特务团”，后来改为“暂编独立第十总队”、“太原绥靖公署教导总队”，被告人亲自担任少将总队附兼政工部（处）长。直到1949年4月24日太原解放，这支部队被全部歼灭为止，被告人一直参与指挥它对中国人民解放军作战。
    当时任阎锡山第七集团军司令的赵承绶也出庭作证。他详细地叙述了被告人城野宏主谋策划和组织日本军政人员成立武装部队的经过。他说：被告人是非常主动、积极地进行这一阴谋活动的。他在煽动前日本军政人员“残留”时，采取了威胁、利诱、欺骗等各种手段。
    被告人和岩田清一等为进一步扩充这个变相的侵略武装，曾多次向阎锡山建议从日本招募“义勇军”。1948年5月，被告人亲自草拟了从日本国内动员“义勇军”五十万人来华以及建立“防共政务局”和“实施全世界规模的反共解放运动”的计划，多次派人回日本活动，并且派永富博之等赴上海、北京等地，企图建立同日本的连络据点以及开辟中日间的密航路线。
    另外，被告人还在1948年10月草拟了一个情况报告，向蒋介石国防部提出在日本招募五百名军官来华的建议。
    法庭审讯了被告人永富博之和菊地修一。他们曾经在日本帝国主义侵华战争中指挥部下残杀我和平居民和被俘人员，在日本投降后又都积极追随城野宏，煽动前日本军政人员残留山西，参加反革命军队，破坏中国人民的解放事业。
    永富博之在山西省闻喜县主持伪横水镇情报工作处期间，曾以极其残酷的手段刑讯中国和平居民，逼索情报，先后亲自指挥和命令部下杀害了一百多人。他在1943年10月7日，在沁源县自强村将党翠娥等妇女和儿童十一人赶入窑洞纵火焚烧。幸免于难的六十来岁的党翠娥从沁源县赶来太原控诉被告人的罪行。
    接着，法庭进行对大野泰治、笠实和神野久吉的事实调查，他们都是傀儡政权和伪警察的直接操纵者，犯有进行经济掠夺、毁灭城镇和残酷镇压和平居民的罪行。他们并且都积极参与了复活日本军国主义的“残留运动”，煽动和组织了大批日本军政人员参加阎锡山军队。大野泰治在1936年在伪满时，曾经以残酷手段刑讯中国民族英雄赵一曼。
    法庭最后审讯了住冈义一。住冈义一在1942年7月下旬和8月上旬曾两次参加了日本侵略军在太原小东门外赛马场屠杀我被俘人员的暴行。在这两次暴行中，八路军被俘人员袁立夫等男女三百四十余人被作为日军新兵“试胆锻炼”的活人靶。
    在确凿的人证物证面前，各被告人对他们所犯的罪行都供认不讳。
    律师们根据被告人服罪和悔罪的表现，请求法庭从宽处刑。
    法庭听取了各被告人的最后陈述。首先发言的是城野宏，他说：“我犯了严重罪行，是个不可饶恕的罪犯，可是中国人民，却给我人道主义的待遇。我完全错了，我的确有罪，请给我以严厉惩处吧！”
    接着相乐圭二说，他从他的血腥的罪行中了解到自己过去所走的战争的道路，是完全错误的，他不仅使中国人民受到了无穷尽的祸害，而且也为日本人民带来了不堪忍受的灾难。“我决不再拿起侵略武器，我宣誓要重新作人。”
    菊地修一、永富博之、住冈义一、大野泰治、笠实和神野久吉在他们的最后陈述中，也一致地认罪悔罪，表示愿意接受法庭的惩处。
    特别军事法庭在十九日休庭进行评议，二十日下午二时半宣布了对各被告人的判决。法庭判处城野宏徒刑十八年，相乐圭二徒刑十五年，菊地修一、永富博之、大野泰治徒刑各十三年，住冈义一、笠实徒刑各十一年，神野久吉徒刑八年，各被告人刑期自判决之日起算，判决前关押的日数，以一日抵徒刑一日。
