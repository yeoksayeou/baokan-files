Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 4th. After a voyage of seventy-three and a half hours, the passenger ship "Zhongxing No. 9" from Shanghai arrived at Dalian Port at 5:30 pm today.

　　The ship carried more than 180 passengers. Because the ocean is still in a foggy season, the ship often sailed safely in the pervasive light fog. Passengers and crew members held a joint party at sea. The passengers also played many cultural and recreational items prepared for them by the ship, and spent a pleasant journey.

　　When the ship arrived at Dalian Port, the crowds who came to greet it at the dock set off firecrackers, and the ships moored in the port sounded their whistles to celebrate the success of the first sea passenger transportation between Shanghai and Dalian.

    上海开出的客轮安全到达大连
    新华社旅大4日电　从上海开出的中兴九号轮，经过了七十三小时三十分的航行以后，今天下午五时半到达大连港。
    这艘船上载着一百八十多名旅客。因为海洋上现在还是多雾的季节，轮船时常在弥漫着的轻雾中安全航行。旅客和船员们曾经在海上举行了联欢晚会。旅客们还玩了轮船为他们准备的许多文化娱乐用品，度过了愉快的旅途生活。
    轮船在到达大连港的时候，码头上前来迎接的群众放起了鞭炮，停泊在港的船只都高鸣欢迎的汽笛，庆贺上海大连间第一次海上旅客运输的成功。
