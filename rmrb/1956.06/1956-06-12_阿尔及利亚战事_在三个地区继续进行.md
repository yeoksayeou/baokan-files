Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 11th: Over the past ten days, French forces in Algeria have mobilized tens of thousands of troops to launch large-scale military offensives against local insurgent armed forces. The French naval and air forces have also been deployed in cooperative operations.

The fighting has been continuous in three regions: the western region of Algeria bordering Morocco, the Kabylie Mountains near Algiers in central Algeria, and the eastern region of Algeria bordering Tunisia.

The French forces are attempting to eliminate the Algerian insurgent armed forces in these regions, but they are far from achieving their goal. For example, in the Kabylie Mountains, Agence France-Presse reports that the French army's attempt to engage in fierce fighting with the guerrillas has failed. The report also states that wherever the French army goes, "the troops only see empty villages, with residents either moving away before the army arrives or hiding in the jungle."

    阿尔及利亚战事
    在三个地区继续进行
    新华社11日讯　阿尔及尔消息：最近十天中，在阿尔及利亚的法军出动了几万人，接连向当地起义人民武装部队发动大规模军事进攻。法国的海空军也出动配合作战。
    战事连续在三个地区进行：阿尔及利亚西部同摩洛哥接境地区，阿尔及利亚中部阿尔及尔附近的卡比利亚山区以及阿尔及利亚东部同突尼斯接境地区。
    法军企图消灭在这些地区内的阿尔及利亚起义人民武装部队，但是法军远没有达到目的。例如，在卡比利亚山区，法新社的消息说，法军想同游击队激战的企图失败了，消息还说，法军所到的地方，“军队只看到空的村庄，居民有的在军队到达以前搬走，有的隐入丛林里了。”
