    Don't Misuse Labor During the Busy Farming Season
    To the Editor:
    The period before the Mangzhong solar term is the tense time for sowing field crops. However, on May 1st, the Bao'an and Xianfeng agricultural cooperatives in Jixian County received orders from the secretary of the township Party general branch and the secretary of the cooperative Party branch to extract a large number of laborers from these two cooperatives to reclaim wasteland. The members felt that this approach was inappropriate and raised objections. However, they were criticized: "This is the call of the county Party committee. If Party members don't go, they must consider the issue of Party membership. If Youth League members don't go, they must consider the issue of League membership. If cooperative members don't go, they must be checked to see if they love the cooperative as they love their home!" Helpless, the Xianfeng and Bao'an agricultural cooperatives had to send more than 230 laborers to reclaim wasteland. As a result, there were not enough laborers to cultivate the land. For example, when the Bao'an cooperative was hoeing the fields, most of the hoes were used by only one male laborer out of four people, and the sowing quality was very rough. Some seeds were planted in the ditches, some ridges were missed, and some manure was spread outside. The cooperative members generally reflected: "If the land is not cultivated well, how much grain will be lost? Reclaiming wasteland at this time is really inappropriate."
    Such an erroneous practice of misusing labor, disregarding the farming season and failing to consider economic effects, should be quickly corrected.

    农忙季节不要乱用劳动力编辑同志：
    芒种节前，正是播种大田作物的紧张时期。可是五月一日这天，集贤县保安、先锋两个农业社却得到乡里党总支书记和社里党支部书记的命令，要这两个社抽出大批劳力去开荒地。社员们觉得这种做法不合适，提出意见。可是他们却受到了批评：“这是县委的号召，党员不去要考虑党籍问题，团员不去要考虑团籍问题，社员不去要检查是不是爱社如爱家！”在无可奈何的情况下，先锋、保安两个农业社只好出动二百三十多名劳力去开荒。这样一来，种地的劳力就不够了。像保安社在耲地的时候，多数耲把四个人中只有一个男劳力，播种质量非常粗糙，有的把种籽点到沟里，有的丢了垅，有的把粪摅到外边。社员普遍反映：“地没有种好，少打多少粮？这时候开荒，真叫不合时宜。”
    像这样不顾农事季节，不考虑经济效果而乱用劳动力的错误做法，应该赶快纠正。
