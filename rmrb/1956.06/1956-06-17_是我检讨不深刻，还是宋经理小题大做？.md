   Is my self-criticism not thorough enough, or is Manager Song making a mountain out of a molehill?
   Editor:
       One Sunday morning, I prepared a basin of water to wash clothes. Manager Song Fenglin's child (six or seven years old) from our company came over and put some scraps of paper and dirty wooden blocks into my basin. I fished his things out, but he got angry and started crying and yelling, grabbing my legs and kicking and punching me. I couldn't pull him away, and later I got anxious and slapped him on the bottom. At this time, Manager Song's wife saw it and rushed out of the house to argue with me loudly. Manager Song also came and sternly demanded that I go to the organization to settle accounts.
       I knew I was wrong – it was very wrong for a person in their twenties to argue with a child. So I went to the organization to apologize to Manager Song. But Manager Song ignored me. Soon after, Manager Song called me in for a talk. When I went, I saw that Deputy Manager Li, who was in charge of political work, the secretary of the political office, and the heads and deputy heads of the secretary section were also present. They said that my behavior was "abusing children," "violating the constitution," and "barbaric and egregious in style," and they wanted me to examine my thinking. I admitted my mistake, but I couldn't understand whether it was "violating the constitution," so they wanted me to conduct a more thorough examination after the meeting.
       I have thought about this issue for a long time and still can't figure it out. I don't understand, is my self-criticism not thorough enough? Or are Manager Song and some leaders in our company making a mountain out of a molehill?

### 是我检讨不深刻，还是宋经理小题大做？

  是我检讨不深刻，还是宋经理小题大做？编辑同志：
    一个星期天的早上，我打了一盆水准备洗衣服。我们公司宋凤林经理的孩子（六、七岁）走来把一些碎纸片和脏木块放在我的盆里。我将他的东西捞出来，谁知道他就恼了，大哭大骂地抓住我脚踢、拳打。我拉不开他，后来也着急了，在他屁股上拍了一巴掌。这时，宋经理的爱人看见了，就从屋里扑过来同我大吵大闹。宋经理也赶来了，声色俱厉地要找我到机关里去算账。
    我知道自己错了——一个二十多岁的人竟和小孩子闹气是很不应该的。于是我就到机关去向宋经理道歉。可是宋经理理都不理我。不久，宋经理却找我谈话了。我去时，看到在场的还有负责政治工作的李副经理、政治办公室秘书、秘书科正副科长等。他们说我这种行为是“摧残儿童”“违犯宪法”“作风野蛮恶劣”，要我检查思想。我承认了错误，但是对于是否“违犯宪法”思想上搞不通，因此他们要我在会后再进行深刻检查。
    我对这个问题想了好久，始终想不通。我不明白，究竟是我检查不深刻呢？还是宋经理和我们公司的一些领导人在小题大做？
