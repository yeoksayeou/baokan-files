On the Two Hands of America's Cold War

    "An intelligence attaché said that the United States has tied its hands in the Asian 'Cold War' and has not used the best weapons, such as jazz music and movies." - This is a news headline from the "New York Times" on June 11.

    It is said that "the most powerful weapon for the United States to win the favor of Asians is its movies and jazz music."

    What makes them think so?

    The "New York Times" tells its readers that there is evidence for this:

    "As in the United States, it is not uncommon for children in Asia to dress like an American cowboy.

    "The American cowboy is worshiped here as an idol. Even a year after the first screening of the film 'Shane' in Bangkok, he is still a hero in Thailand."

    In fact, the influence of American movies goes far beyond just some "children dressing like an American cowboy is not too uncommon"? In Manila, Tokyo, Seoul, Bangkok, Singapore... the number of juvenile delinquents has been increasing year by year, and the number of rape, robbery, theft, pornography and other cases in society is increasing more and more. Isn't it closely related to Hollywood movies, this "best weapon"?

    On my desk, I happen to have a Hong Kong newspaper from May 23, which published a social news item with the title: "Rebel Without a Cause Sequel Played, a Child as the Protagonist," which wrote: There is a thirteen-year-old child in Hong Kong who went to the cinema to watch the Hollywood movie "Rebel Without a Cause" thirteen times, bought more than one hundred photos of James Dean, the protagonist in the film who played the rebel, and learned from the plot of "Rebel Without a Cause," stole more than one thousand Hong Kong dollars and fifty US dollars from his mother and aunt, and then ran away from home and wandered outside for a week, eating, drinking, staying in hotels and watching plays, etc., spending almost all the money before being found by the police.

    Can parents all over the world not sigh in unison about this kind of thing? However, the "New York Times" is gloatingly boasting that the "American cowboy" has found admirers here!

    This is "one of the weapons." Another "weapon" - American jazz music, is said to also have "great appeal." What is the jazz music recommended by the "New York Times"?

    Jazz music was originally folk music of African Americans, which expressed the joy and pain of African Americans. However, in recent years, this beautiful music in the United States has been swallowed up by so-called "rock and roll music," "hot music," and the like. It has become a frenzied tune full of pornographic stimulation, rude shouting, and unpleasant noise.

    Mr. Alden of the "New York Times" and those American intelligence officials are advocating, and they are demanding to recklessly extend into Asian countries to carry out activities that are morally corrupting and mind-numbing, that is such a pair of dirty hands!

    But, will American films like "Rebel Without a Cause" and decadent jazz music really "win the favor of Asians" as Alden and American intelligence attachés think?

    When the American Cold War planners are dreaming of using "weapons" such as music and movies to facilitate their continued Cold War and colonial penetration, they have precisely overlooked a most important fact: Asia is already daytime, and people are awake.

    The day after the "New York Times" published this report advocating the use of American movies and jazz music as Cold War tools, on June 12, India's "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published a news item reporting that the Health Standing Committee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation requested the Indian government to completely ban the screening of American films, on the grounds that the purpose of these American films is to create hatred of certain countries, or to incite violent emotions, or to impart bandit techniques, and to incite unhealthy sexual excitement in men and women, young and old.

    The Cold War planners who advocate letting go of the use of movies and music to poison and anesthetize Asians can rest!

### 论美国冷战的双手

    论美国冷战的双手
    “情报武官说，美国在亚洲‘冷战’中束缚了双手，像爵士音乐和电影等最好的武器并没有利用。”——这是六月十一日“纽约时报”的一条新闻标题。
    据说：“美国赢得亚洲人好感的最有力的武器是它的电影和爵士音乐。”
    何以见得呢？
    “纽约时报”告诉它的读者说，有此为证：
    “像在美国一样，亚洲的儿童打扮得像一个美国牧童也不是太不平常的事。
    “美国牧童在这里被当作偶像崇拜。甚至在牧童歇恩的影片最初在曼谷放映之后一年的今天，他在泰国还是一位英雄。”
    其实，美国电影的影响所及，岂至只是有些“儿童打扮得像一个美国牧童也不是太不平常的事”而已？在马尼拉、东京、汉城、曼谷、新加坡……许多地方的少年罪犯连年激增，社会上的强奸、劫杀、偷盗、色情等等案件愈来愈多，难道不是和好莱坞电影这个“最好的武器”有着密切关系吗？
    我的案头上刚好有一份五月二十三日的香港报纸，上面登载着一条社会新闻，标题是：“阿飞正传演续集，一名小童任主角”，里面写道：香港有一个十三岁的小孩子，到电影院去看了好莱坞影片“阿飞正传”十三次，购买了片中主角、扮演阿飞的占士·甸的照片一百多张，并且向“阿飞正传”的情节学样，偷了他妈妈和姨母一千多元港币和五十元美钞，然后逃离家庭在外流浪一个星期，吃、喝、住旅馆和看戏等，把钱将近花光后，才被警察找到。
    天下父母，对于这种事情能不同声叹息？然而，“纽约时报”却在得意洋洋地吹嘘“美国牧童”在这里找到了崇拜者哩！
    这是“武器之一”。另一种“武器”——美国的爵士音乐，据说也同样有“很大的吸引力”。什么是“纽约时报”所推荐的爵士音乐呢？
    爵士音乐本来是美洲黑人的民间音乐，它表现了美洲黑人的欢乐和痛苦。可是，这些年来，这种优美的音乐在美国已被所谓“摇曳音乐”、“热辣音乐”之类所吞没了。它变成了充满色情的刺激、粗野的喊叫和难听的噪音的狂乱曲调。
    “纽约时报”的艾尔登先生和美国那些情报官员所宣扬的，他们要求肆无忌惮地伸到亚洲国家中间来进行伤风败俗和迷人心智的活动的，就是这样一双污手！
    可是，“阿飞正传”之类的美国影片和靡靡的爵士音乐，真的如艾尔登和美国情报武官们所想的，会“赢得亚洲人好感”吗？
    美国的冷战策划者们在梦想着利用音乐和电影这类“武器”来便利他们继续进行冷战和殖民渗入的时候，恰恰忽略了一个最重要的事实，这就是：亚洲已是白天，人们是觉醒了。
    就在“纽约时报”发表这则鼓吹用美国电影和爵士音乐作为冷战工具的第二天，六月十二日，印度“甘露市场报”发表了一则消息，报道加尔各答市政机关健康常设委员会要求印度政府完全禁止放映美国电影，理由是这些美国影片的目的是要制造对某些国家的仇恨，或者是煽起强暴的情绪，或者是传授匪徒的技术，以及向男女少年煽起不健康的性的兴奋。
    鼓吹放手利用电影和音乐来毒化和麻醉亚洲人的冷战策士们可以休矣！
