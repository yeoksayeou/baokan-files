I was very excited to hear Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget. The report stated that the 1956 budget was compiled in accordance with the requirements of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, which called on the people of the whole country to strive to complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in accordance with the new situation in the country. This is of great significance. I fully agree with this report and suggest that the congress adopt the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget.

I also agree with Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the Model Regulations (Draft) for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and suggest that the congress approve them all.

Now, in connection with the shortcomings and problems in my past work, I would like to talk about some of my experiences based on the principles indicated in Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's and Director Bo Yibo's speeches:

(1) The law of planned and proportional development of our national economy, determined according to China's actual conditions, should be: "On the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, maintain a certain proportional relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture in accordance with the economic development and people's living standards in different periods," that is, now we should "actively develop light industry on the basis of vigorously developing agriculture while developing heavy industry." The experience of the country's construction over the past three years has confirmed the above point of view, which is extremely valuable. Therefore, the task of the 1956 national budget expenditure is to "guarantee the priority development of heavy industry, and at the same time actively develop light industry, agriculture, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings according to the plan for developing the national economy, so that they maintain a due and reasonable proportion between them." From this, it can be seen that the state's planned budget is a whole, and it is considered from the overall situation. Various regions and departments cooperate and coordinate with each other. When we implement the planned budget, we must also have an overall concept and a global perspective, and learn and master the laws of national economic development. We must not only do our own work well, but also cooperate well with the work of other departments. Any one-sided emphasis on the gains and losses of a region or department, regardless of other regions and departments, is a concrete manifestation of departmentalism, which is undesirable.

(2) Whenever a planned budget is formulated or a specific construction project is carried out, because it contains various aspects, it is necessary to grasp the key points, master the center, and solve some key problems at any time; however, precisely because there are many aspects, we must consider overall planning and comprehensive preparation, so that the operation of the entire machine will not be affected by the loosening or falling off of a screw. For example, the report pointed out that some basic construction units failed to complete their plans in the past five months, mainly due to the insufficient supply of building materials such as steel and cement, and machinery and equipment. Therefore, it is proposed that comprehensive preparation for basic construction must be strengthened. This fundamental solution is completely correct. I believe that basic construction departments and other relevant departments will attach importance to overall planning and comprehensive preparation in the future.

(3) A small number of people, when implementing the production and construction policies put forward by the Party and the government in various periods, do not adopt the attitude and method of carefully studying, deeply understanding, and then combining them with the specific conditions of the region and department to apply and implement them, but adopt the attitude and method of "interpreting literally, speculating and exaggerating," rigidly copying, and "following the trend," and the result is making "left" or right-leaning deviations or mistakes; for example, one-sidedly emphasizing economy without asking whether it is applicable, one-sidedly emphasizing "more and faster" and forgetting "better and more economical," which caused losses to the work. There was also a small number of people who adopted a not very honest attitude or a dogmatic method when learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which must be corrected.

The difference between the overall point of view and departmentalism, the difference between overall planning and one-sided consideration, and the difference between seeking truth from facts and subjective dogmatism, which I have talked about above, are the dividing lines between doing a good job and doing a bad job. I personally believe that the leading cadres of every agency or enterprise must deeply understand these basic spirits in the report and speech when implementing the national planned budget, and actively give play to the power of the masses, and strive to implement them, so as to ensure the continuous improvement of the quality and efficiency of the work, and better complete the tasks assigned by the state.

In the past few years since liberation, under the Party's tolerance and education, I have been responsible for some work in the Shanghai municipal construction and urban planning departments. At the end of last month, in Shanghai, as a people's representative, from the perspective of factory production safety and hygiene and its impact on the surrounding safety and hygiene, I inspected eight factories, seven of which were chemical factories and one was a small steel mill. In early this month, I participated in the Anhui Provincial Construction Undertakings Visiting Group organized by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, visited several coal mines of the Huainan Mining Bureau, the Foziling and Meishan Reservoirs, and saw a lot of municipal construction and building construction in Hefei. Now, please allow me to combine my feelings and experiences during the inspection and visit with the reports and speeches I have heard at the conference these days, and talk about the following three issues:

(1) The full utilization of old industrial cities and the issue of urban redevelopment and urban planning. The establishment and redevelopment of cities are mainly for the development of industrial production, and also provide good living, working, learning, transportation, and recreational conditions for the working people; that is, the municipal construction of socialist cities should adopt the policy of serving production first and serving the working people. Urban planning is the specific program of urban construction, and it is the rational arrangement and layout of urban construction projects. Therefore, the main tasks of urban planning are to rationally reflect the principle of combining the construction and development of various departments of the city, the principle of combining individual construction with overall requirements, and the principle of combining the city's immediate construction with its long-term development; the embodiment of the principle of mutual combination mentioned here is also the solution of the contradiction between each other, and this kind of contradiction is more prominent in the transformation and redevelopment of old cities. In the past few years, our understanding of the nature, scale, and direction of Shanghai's future development has not been clear enough. Our specific construction work has inevitably proceeded with more or less swaying between two extreme ideas, one is the "Greater Shanghai" idea and the other is the "make do" idea, and the policy ideas of urban planning have also been uncertain. In addition, there is a lack of planning experience and methods have problems, the work has not been actively carried out, and the planning cannot be determined; when the reconstruction and new construction of certain factories and enterprises, docks, warehouses, or cultural and educational institutions are related to the requirements of urban planning, they sometimes inevitably stick to their own opinions and take a long time to resolve, which is our main responsibility. Now, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's speech pointed out that the coastal cities with the original industrial base must be fully utilized to tap their production potential, and that considerable enterprise redevelopment should also be carried out in conjunction with the socialist transformation and production reorganization of these areas; in this way, the specific policy of Shanghai's urban redevelopment and the nature and scale of urban planning are relatively clear. Because, to utilize, tap, and redevelop industrial production enterprises, then the urban construction (urban public utilities) closely related to it must also be utilized, tapped, and redeveloped accordingly, and this requirement is particularly obvious in Shanghai. Why? Because Shanghai's urban public utilities, due to the long-term bloody rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries for more than 100 years before liberation, they established some foundations to meet the needs of plunder, exploitation, and licentiousness, but it was a chaotic, fragmented, deformed, dilapidated, and unbalanced foundation, which was an extremely weak and unreasonable foundation. Today, when the people have mastered political power and are carrying out socialist construction, it must be fundamentally transformed and necessarily expanded to meet the requirements of industrial production and people's lives.

To list a few specific examples: (1) There is a serious shortage of workers' housing. Since liberation, the state and enterprises have invested in the construction of approximately 2 million square meters of workers' housing in Shanghai. Now, the city has a total of approximately 24 million square meters of "building area" of residential houses, according to incomplete statistics, which is equivalent to an average "living area" of approximately 2 square meters per person. The poor living conditions of most workers can be seen from this. (2) Urban traffic is extremely congested. Shanghai currently has more than 1,200 buses and trams, and the number of passengers on public vehicles reaches 1.6 million per day (according to a survey in early 1955), resulting in serious congestion when workers take buses to work every morning. It is impossible to fundamentally solve this problem by simply strengthening traffic route planning and vehicle scheduling. A considerable number of public vehicles must be added. Urban freight transportation, due to the lack of trucks, has to retain a part of the heavy and backward collapsed cars and the collapsed car workers with extremely high labor intensity, which is also extremely unreasonable and must be reformed. (3) Environmental sanitation is very poor in many areas. Shanghai's water consumption is about 900,000 tons per day, while the amount of sewage treated is only about 35,000 tons. The reason is that the sewer pipe network is incomplete, the percentage of homes with flush toilets is not high, and especially the industrial wastewater from factories is mostly discharged into nearby rivers without treatment, and the Suzhou River, one of the main rivers in the city, accounts for a considerable amount (about 250,000 tons per day), causing serious pollution in the middle and lower reaches of the Suzhou River. The water surface is often black, and the stench is steaming, threatening the health of residents on both sides of the river, on the water, and in the downtown area. Other rivers are similar. In order to thoroughly improve such poor environmental sanitation conditions, the relevant departments under the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee are currently investigating, analyzing, researching, and planning, and considering holding various urgent measures and basic construction projects separately to increase sewer pipes, strengthen sanitary supervision of factories, and periodically implement the method of allowing industrial wastewater to be discharged into the sewers after each factory has treated it first.

From the above examples, it can be seen that Shanghai's urban public utilities must be expanded and newly built in a timely manner within the scope of the state's financial resources in the future, so as to improve the people's working conditions and living conditions, and give full play to the greatest role in tapping potential, increasing production, and accelerating national industrialization.

In order to carry out the above-mentioned urban public utilities in a planned, step-by-step, and coordinated manner, on the one hand, we hope that the state will include a considerable amount of operating expenses in the annual budget in the future, and on the other hand, we ask the central government to strengthen the leadership of urban planning. Therefore, we hope that the central urban construction department will send a part of its leadership to help Shanghai formulate urban plans in a timely manner to meet urgent needs. When planning, we hope that relevant central departments such as the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Health will cooperate closely with the Ministry of Urban Construction, and at the same time, separately notify their subordinate agencies in Shanghai (Railway Bureau, Port Authority, etc.) to also cooperate closely with the Shanghai urban planning agencies, so as to obtain various agreements on planning, so that urban planning becomes an important part of the overall planning of Shanghai's national economic development, and also becomes a reliable basis for the overall planning of Shanghai's transportation departments (Railway Bureau, Port Authority, etc.); as for other old industrial cities along the coast and some important cities, such as Hefei in Anhui Province, we hope that they can also be handled by analogy. This is extremely important for the country to specifically realize the national economic development plan; the Soviet Union has a saying: "Urban planning is the continuation and concretization of the national economic plan," which fully illustrates this meaning.

(2) The issue of workers' production safety and hygiene. All relevant parties have gradually attached importance to this issue, so I will not say much here; I will only mention three points: (1) I hope that production safety and hygiene education will be implemented in conjunction with various production reforms and the establishment of new operating procedures, and that production safety systems will be established and production hygiene supervision will be strengthened; in this way, production and safety and hygiene can be unified instead of being opposed, which is easier to promote. (2) I hope that the medical and health departments will attach importance to the work of production safety and hygiene in workshops, and mobilize experts to start in-depth research on the situation and prevention methods of occupational diseases in some factories in some industrial cities, according to their characteristics. (3) I hope that those who have arduous working conditions, poor safety and hygiene conditions, and are particularly important for national industrial construction, such as miners, can be given priority and specific actions can be taken; the Huainan Mining Bureau in Anhui Province is a good example of gradually implementing various improvement measures for old mines and adopting new production equipment and safety and hygiene equipment for new mines.

Here, I would like to talk about the environmental sanitation problems around factories that are harmful. The poor environmental sanitation in many areas of Shanghai, in terms of water pollution, has been discussed above; and in terms of air pollution, there is also the same serious situation. The reason is that some chemical factories that emit toxic gases, etc., are located in residential areas, which seriously hinder the health of residents. The expansion of such factories has become an extremely complex issue in Shanghai today; I will not talk about the situation of the seven chemical factories I inspected hindering the surrounding environmental sanitation. I will only talk about one point, that is, four of them said that it is best to move to a new factory or prepare to move the factory. I hope that the central Ministry of Health will implement sanitary supervision of similar factories as soon as possible, and that the specific management agencies can combine increasing industrial production and improving environmental sanitation when implementing supervision, so as to achieve the requirements of not delaying production and hygiene.

(3) The issue of building workers' housing. Recently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, under the instructions of the Party Central Committee, cooperated with relevant parties to convene a working conference on labor insurance and living housing, and drafted some measures and methods to improve the welfare of workers, which are very necessary. I hope that the State Council will approve and implement them as soon as possible. Since liberation, the Shanghai workers' housing has been designed with different standards, using different financial resources, and adopting different construction methods by the Municipal People's Government and several industrial enterprises, and some have been built, gaining experience, and also producing shortcomings and errors. Now, let's talk about three aspects: (1) Area selection and living area. The residential area should be close to the factory or office location, and also close to the city's "downtown area," so that it is convenient for workers to go to and from work, and also convenient for workers and their families to carry out various life activities and cultural and sports activities; the housing should be in the form of apartments, and the number of rooms and area per household should be preferably small and many rooms (generally, two rooms are desired) rather than a single large room. (2) Public welfare facilities and municipal construction. If there are no existing vegetable markets, primary schools, nurseries, medical clinics, cooperative shops, post offices, etc. that can be used nearby, they should be newly built at the same time as needed; municipal construction such as roads, water supply, drainage, electric lights, public telephones, etc. should be equipped, and public bus transportation should also be convenient when necessary. (3) Source of funds and operation and management. According to the experience of previous years, it is advisable to have unified planning of the site, unified design, unified contracting and construction, unified registration and distribution, and unified management and maintenance; the source of funds is that the factories, enterprises, or agencies applying for construction raise funds themselves through various possible methods, register and pay to the "General Party A," and receive them after they are built; this is in terms of housing. Public buildings are built by relevant departments in their respective budgets; municipal construction within the residential blocks is invested as part of the residential building, and outside the blocks is invested and built by relevant urban public utility departments. The above three points of view have not yet been finalized in Shanghai, and I hope that the relevant central departments will convene various cities that have achieved certain results in building workers' housing to exchange opinions and summarize a set of experiences for the benefit of local reference and adoption.

What I have talked about above is inevitably one-sided or wrong, please criticize and correct me, delegates. Finally, I wish the 1956 budget a successful realization! Our country's first five-year plan will be successfully completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule! Socialist construction will advance victoriously!

    旧工业城市的充分利用与城市改建
    ——赵祖康代表的发言
    我很兴奋地听了李先念副总理兼财政部长关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，报告说：1956年的预算是按照中共中央和国务院根据国家新形势，号召全国人民争取提前完成和超额完成五年计划的要求来编制的，这意义是太重要了。我完全同意这报告，并建议大会通过关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算。     
    我也同意廖鲁言部长所作关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明和彭真副委员长兼秘书长所作全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，建议大会都予以通过。
    现在，就李先念副总理报告中和李富春副总理及薄一波主任发言中所指示的几个原则，联系自己过去工作中的缺点和毛病，谈谈我的一些体会：
    （一）根据中国实际情况所决定的有计划按比例发展我国国民经济的规律应当是：“在优先发展重工业的前提下，按照不同时期的经济发展情况和人民生活水平，保持重工业、轻工业和农业的一定的比例关系，”也就是现在应当“在发展重工业的同时，必须在大力发展农业的基础上积极地发展轻工业。”国家三年多的建设经验证实了上述一个论点，是极可宝贵的。1956年国家预算支出的任务，因而就是“根据发展国民经济的计划，保证优先发展重工业，同时积极发展轻工业、农业、交通运输业和文化教育事业，使它们之间保持应有的合理的比例”。由此可见，国家的计划预算是整体的，是从全局考虑的，各个地区、各个部门之间是相互配合协调的；我们在实现计划预算时，也必须具有整体观念和全局观点，并学习和掌握国民经济发展的规律，既要做好各自的工作，还要配合好别个部门的工作。一切片面强调一个地区或一个部门的利害得失，而不顾其他地区部门，乃是本位主义的具体表现，是要不得的。
      （二）凡是制订一个计划预算，进行一项具体建设，因为其中都包含有各个方面，应当抓住重点，掌握中心，随时解决一些关键问题，这是必要的；但是正也由于方面多，必须考虑到全面的规划，全面的准备，才能不会因一个螺丝钉的松动或脱落而影响到整个机器的运转。例如，报告中指出：有些基本建设单位在过去五个月中，主要由于钢材、水泥等建筑材料和机器设备供应不足，没有完成计划，因而提出必须加强基本建设的全面准备工作，这一个根本解决办法，是完全正确的。我相信基本建设部门和其他有关部门今后都能重视全面规划和全面准备这一点。
      （三）有一小部分人在执行党和政府在各个时期所提出的生产建设的方针政策时，不是采取细心学习，深切体会，再结合本地区本部门的具体情况，加以运用贯彻的态度和方法，而是采取“望文生义、揣摩虚夸”、硬搬死套、“赶浪头”的态度和方法，其结果就是犯过“左”或右倾的偏差或错误；例如，片面强调节约而不问适用，片面强调“多、快”而忘了“好、省”，使工作遭受到损失。还曾经有一小部分人在学习苏联先进经验时，也同样采取不很老实的态度或教条主义的方法，这都是必须纠正的。
    以上所谈整体观点与本位主义的不同，全面规划与片面考虑的不同，和实事求是与主观教条的不同，乃是工作做好或做坏的分界线；个人认为每一个机关或企业的领导干部在实现国家计划预算时，必须深刻体会报告和发言中这一些基本精神，并积极发挥群众的力量，努力加以贯彻，以保证不断提高工作的质量和效率，更好地完成国家所交给的任务。
    解放几年来，在党的宽容和教育下，我在上海市政建设和城市规划部门负责一部分工作。上月底在上海，作为一个人民代表，本着工厂生产安全卫生及其对四周安全卫生影响的观点，视察了八个工厂，其中七个是化工厂，一个是小型炼钢厂；本月上旬，参加了政协上海市委会组织的安徽省建设事业参观团，参观了淮南矿务局的几个煤矿，佛子岭及梅山水库，并在合肥看见了不少市政建设与建筑物的建设。现在，请允许我更就视察参观中的感想和体会，结合这几天在大会中所听的报告和发言，谈谈以下三个问题：
      （一）旧工业城市的充分利用与城市改建及城市规划问题。城市的建立与改建主要是为发展工业生产，同时也为劳动人民供给良好的居住、劳动、学习、交通和文娱游乐条件；那就是，社会主义城市的市政建设应采取首先为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的方针。城市规划是城市建设的具体纲领，是城市建设项目的合理安排和布置，因而城市规划的主要任务，是合理体现城市各个部门的建设与发展之间相结合的原则，个别建设与整体要求之间相结合的原则和城市近期建设与远景发展之间相结合的原则；这里所说彼此相结合的原则的体现也即是彼此间矛盾问题的解决，而此种矛盾在旧城市的改造改建中更为突出。过去几年来，我们对于上海市今后发展的性质规模与方向的认识，是不够明确的，我们的具体建设工作免不了或多或少在两个极端的思想，即一个是“大上海”思想而另一个是“因陋就简”的思想之间，摇摆进行，城市规划的政策思想也就把握不定，加以规划经验缺乏，方法有毛病，工作未能积极展开，规划不能确定；某些工厂企业、码头、仓库或文教机关进行改建新建关联到应当和城市规划要求相结合时，有时便不免各执一辞，旷日持久，才得到解决，这是我们应当负主要责任的。现在，李先念副总理的报告和李富春副总理的发言指出：对原有工业基础的沿海城市必须充分利用，以发掘其生产潜力，而且还应当结合这些地区的社会主义改造和生产改组，进行不少企业的适当的改建；这样，上海的城市改建的具体方针和城市规划的性质规模便比较很明确了。因为，要对工业生产企业进行利用、发掘和改建，那么，同它密切相关的城市建设（城市公用事业）也必然要进行相应的利用、发掘和改建，这一要求在上海尤为明显。为什么呢？因为上海的城市公用事业，由于解放前一百多年帝国主义和国民党反动派的长期血腥统治，他们为了满足掠夺剥削和荒淫享乐的需要，多少建立了一些基础，但那是一个混乱的割裂的畸形的残旧的不平衡的基础，是一个极薄弱极不合理的基础，到今天在人民掌握了政权，进行社会主义的建设时，必须加以根本的改造和必要的扩大，才能符合工业生产、人民生活的要求。
    略举几个具体例子：（1）职工住宅严重缺少。上海自解放以来，由国家及企业投资兴建职工住宅约200万平方公尺，现在全市共有居住房屋“建筑面积”，据不完全统计，约有2，400万平方公尺，合每人平均“居住面积”约2平方公尺，大多数职工居住情况之差，于此可见。（2）市内交通拥挤异常。上海现有公共汽车、电车计1，200余辆，而公共车辆乘客数，每天达160万人次（据1955年初调查），造成每日早上职工上班乘车时严重拥挤现象，如仅靠加强行车路线规划，加强车辆调度，不可能根本解决，必须添置相当大数量的公共车辆才行。市内货物运输，由于缺乏卡车，不得不保留一部分笨重落后的塌车和劳动强度极高的塌车工人，也是极不合理，必须改革的。（3）环境卫生有不少地区很差。上海的自来水用量全市每天约90万吨，而污水处理量仅约3.5万吨，原因由于下水道管网不全，住家用水厕的百分比不高，尤其是工厂的工业废水绝大部分不经处理即流入附近的河道，而以流入市内主要河道之一苏州河占相当大的数量（每天约25万吨），造成苏州河中下游严重污浊，水面经常呈黑色，臭气熏蒸，威胁两岸、水上及市中区居民的身体健康，其他河中亦类此。为了彻底改善这样坏的环境卫生情况，上海市人民委员会所属各有关部门现正在调查、分析、研究、规划中，考虑分别举办增加下水管道，加强对工厂的卫生监督，定期分批实行工业废水先经各厂处理方准排入下水道办法等各项急要措施和基本建设。
    从以上举例，可见上海的城市公用事业在今后一定时期，在国家财力可能范围内，必须及时进行各种必要的扩建新建，才能改善人民的劳动条件与生活居住条件，为发掘潜力增加生产，加速国家工业化发挥最大作用。
    为了有计划、有步骤、有配合地进行上述种种城市公用事业，我们一方面希望国家在今后每年预算中列入相当数额的事业费支出，一方面请中央即予加强对城市规划的领导。因此，希望中央城市建设部分出一部分领导力量帮助上海及时制订城市规划，以应迫切需要。在规划时，希望中央有关部门如铁道部、交通部、卫生部与城市建设部密切合作，同时分别通知在上海的所属机关（铁路局、港务局等）亦与上海城市规划机构密切合作，以取得规划上的各种协议，使城市规划成为上海整个国民经济发展的全面规划的一个重要组成部分，也成为上海各交通部门（铁路局、港务局等）的全面规划的一个可靠依据；至于沿海其他旧的工业城市及若干重要的城市，如安徽省的合肥，希望亦能类推办理。这对于国家具体实现国民经济发展计划是极其重要的；苏联有一句话：“城市规划是国民经济计划的继续和具体化”，就充分说明这个意义。
      （二）工人生产的安全卫生问题。这一问题，各有关方面都已逐渐重视起来，这里不多说；只提三点：（1）希望结合通过各种生产改革和建立新的操作规程来贯彻生产安全卫生教育，确立生产安全制度和加强生产卫生监督；这样，可以把生产和安全卫生统一起来，而不是对立，比较易于推行。（2）希望医疗卫生部门重视车间生产安全卫生工作，并发动专家在若干工业城市的某些工厂，根据特点，开始深入研究职业病的情况与预防方法。（3）希望凡是劳动条件艰苦，安全、卫生条件基础差，而又关系国家工业建设特别重要的，如矿工，能够首先得到重视并具体进行；安徽省淮南矿务局对老矿井陆续举办种种改善措施，对新矿井采用新式的生产设备与安全卫生设备是一个良好的例子。
    这里，附带谈谈带有危害性的工厂四周的环境卫生问题。上海不少地区环境卫生之差，就水体的污染论，上边已谈过；而就空气的污染论，也有同样严重情况。其原因是由于某些散放毒害气体的化学工厂等，设置在四周是居住地区之内，严重妨碍居民健康。对于此种工厂的扩建，今天在上海便成为极复杂的问题；我所视察的七个化工厂妨碍四周环境卫生情况，这里不谈。只谈一点，那就是其中四个厂表示最好迁并新厂或准备迁厂。希望中央卫生部对类似此种工厂的卫生监督，早日实行，而具体管理机构于实行监督时，能把增加工业生产与改进环境卫生结合起来处理，以达到生产、卫生两不误的要求。
      （三）修建职工住宅问题。最近全国总工会在党中央的指示下协同各有关方面召开劳动保险、生活住宅工作会议，拟出一些改进职工生活福利的措施和办法，是很必要的，希望国务院早日予以批准实施。上海职工住宅自解放几年来，市人民政府和若干工业企业，曾经设计不同的标准，运用不同的财源，采取不同的建造办法，兴建了一些，取得了经验，也产生了缺点和错误。现在谈谈三个方面：（1）地区选择与居住面积。住宅地区以既能接近工厂或办公地点，又能接近城市“闹区”为宜，这样既便于职工上下班，又便于职工及其家属其他各种生活活动和文娱体育活动；住宅采取公寓式，每户住屋间数及面积以宁愿开间小、间数多（一般希望两间），而不愿独间的大开间为一般要求。（2）公共福利设施与市政建设。菜场、小学、托儿所、医疗所、合作商店、邮局等如附近无旧有的可利用，应视需要同时新建；市政建设如道路、给水、排水、电灯、公共电话等均应配备，必要时还应有公共汽车交通的便利。（3）经费来源与经营管理。根据历年经验，以统一规划地盘，统一设计，统一发包施工，统一登记分配，统一管理维护为宜；其经费来源，则由申请建造的各工厂企业或机关采用各种可能的办法自行筹集，向“总甲方”登记付款，于造成后领用；这是就住宅而言。公共建筑则由各有关部门列入各自预算建造；市政建设在住宅街坊以内的作为住宅建筑的一部分投资，在街坊以外的由各有关城市公用事业部门投资兴建。以上三点意见在上海还未得到定论，希望中央有关部门召集各城市对兴建职工住宅具有一定成绩的，交换意见，总结出一套经验，以利各地参考采用。
    以上所谈，不免片面或错误之处，请各位代表批评、指正。最后，祝1956年预算胜利实现！我国第一个五年计划胜利地提前完成和超额完成！社会主义建设胜利迈进！
