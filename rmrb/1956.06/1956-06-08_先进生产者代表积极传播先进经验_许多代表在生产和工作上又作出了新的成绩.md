Advanced Producer Representatives Actively Spread Advanced Experiences
Many Representatives Have Made New Achievements in Production and Work

    This newspaper reports that representatives from various regions who attended the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference are actively spreading various advanced experiences.
    The eleven advanced producer representatives from the textile machinery industry who attended the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference demonstrated many advanced work methods at the Shanxi State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory. Xu Xigang, a young worker at this factory, reduced the time it took to process a part from five and a half minutes according to the quota to one minute and fifteen seconds after learning advanced experiences. Zhang Zhenjiu, a worker at Zhengzhou Printing Plant, immediately used his rest time to introduce the plate-mounting and inking methods he learned at the conference to the workers after returning to the factory. Sheng Li, a lathe operator, and Li Yongshun, a milling machine operator, from the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, who had attended the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference, also gave demonstrations in Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places. Representatives from the electrical workshops of various factories in the power system, together with technical cadres from the Ministry of Power Industry and other units, went to the Nanjing Xiaguan Power Plant to evaluate the experience of the plant's electrical branch in safe operation for 1,377 days. On this basis, they summarized an advanced and complete experience in electrical safety operation, which is to be promoted in Shanghai and other places.
    After returning to their posts, many advanced producer representatives have made many new achievements in production and work. Lin Shanfu, a labor model from Shanghai No. 10 Steel Plant who created the "universal rolling mill," solved a long-standing problem on two large motors in the rolling mill workshop by using the "spindle oil" method to lubricate the motors after returning to the factory. In the past, these two motors had to be stopped for an hour after running for only an hour and a half due to overheating of the lead bushings, which often affected production. The four representatives from the advanced group of Shanghai Coal Mine Design Institute – the Mechanical Manufacturing Section's drafting group – immediately promoted the two advanced drafting experiences of the Beijing Design Institute and the Shenyang Design Institute after returning to the design institute. They improved the original operating procedures and labor organization. Trial results showed that each person could draft 105 drawings per day, and work efficiency increased by one and a half times compared to before they went to Beijing for the conference.

    先进生产者代表积极传播先进经验
    许多代表在生产和工作上又作出了新的成绩
    本报讯　各地出席过全国先进生产者代表会议的代表，正在积极传播各种先进经验。
    出席全国先进生产者代表会议的十一名纺织机械工业部门的先进生产者，到山西省国营经纬纺织机械厂表演了许多种先进工作法。这个厂的青年工人徐锡刚学习先进经验以后，加工一个零件的时间由定额的五分半钟降低到一分十五秒。郑州市印刷厂工人张振久回厂以后，马上利用休息时间向职工们介绍了在会上学习的上版法和沾版法。曾经出席全国先进生产者代表会议的上海机床厂车工盛利和铣工李永顺，还到南京、无锡等地作了表演。出席会议的电业系统各厂电气车间的代表，同电力工业部等单位的技术干部一起，到南京下关发电厂鉴定了这个厂电气分场安全运行1，377天的经验，并且在这个基础上总结出一个先进完整的电气安全运行的经验，准备在上海等地推广。
    许多先进生产者代表回到工作岗位以后，在生产和工作上又作出了许多新的成绩。创造“万能轧钢机”的上海第十钢厂劳动模范林善福，回到厂里以后就采用“锭子油”润滑马达的方法，把轧钢车间两只大马达上长期存在的问题解决了。这两只马达过去因为铅婆司发热，有时开动一小时半就要停上一个小时，经常影响生产。上海煤矿设计院先进小组——机械制造科描图组的四个代表，回到设计院以后，立即推广了北京设计院和沈阳设计院的两项描图先进经验，改进了原来的操作程序和劳动组织，试行结果，每人每天能描图105张，工作效率比他们去北京开会以前提高了一倍半。
