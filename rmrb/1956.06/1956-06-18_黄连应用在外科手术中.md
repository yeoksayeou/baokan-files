Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 17th. Professor Wu Heguang, the president of the Sichuan Medical College Affiliated Hospital, recently used the traditional Chinese medicine Coptis to replace the commonly used drugs, Succinylsulfathiazole (SS) and Streptomycin, to inhibit intestinal bacteria before and after a large intestine resection operation, and achieved very good results.

For the past two months, Professor Wu Heguang and the doctors of the clinical surgery teaching and research group have used Coptis to replace these two drugs in dozens of abdominal surgery cases, and have obtained the same results. The clinical surgery teaching and research group is now summarizing these experiences, and preparing to continue to expand the application range of Coptis in abdominal surgery.

Succinylsulfathiazole and Streptomycin are two very expensive drugs. The cost of patients taking Coptis is only one-tenth of the cost of using these two drugs. At the same time, Coptis has the advantage of being a safer medicine than these two drugs, and no side effects have been found so far.

    黄连应用在外科手术中
    新华社成都17日电　四川医学院附属医院院长吴和光教授最近在一次大肠切除手术中，用中药黄连来代替手术前后用以抑制腹内细菌常用的药品：琥珀醯磺胺噻唑（简称SS）和链霉素，收到很好效果。
    近两个月来，吴和光教授和临床外科教研组的医生们在几十个腹腔手术病例上都用黄连来代替这两种药品，也获得同样效果。临床外科教研组现在正总结这些经验，准备继续扩大黄连在腹部外科手术上的应用范围。
    琥珀醯磺胺噻唑和链霉素是两种价格很贵的药品，病人服用黄连只相当于使用这两种药品所需价钱的十分之一。同时，黄连比这两种药品，还具有药性安全的优点，到现在还没有发现任何副作用。
