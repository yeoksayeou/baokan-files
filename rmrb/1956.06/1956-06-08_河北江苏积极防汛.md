Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th: The flood season in Hebei Province has arrived earlier than in previous years, and the people on both sides of the main rivers have gone up to the embankments to defend against floods. After continuous rainfall from June 2nd to 3rd, the water level in the Hutuo River, Jiyun River, and tributaries of the Daqing River in Hebei Province rose at one point. Among the more than 200 hydrological stations, water level stations, and flood reporting stations in the province, the 40 stations located in important areas have started reporting floods earlier this year. The Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters has recently been established and is preparing to add 25 basic flood reporting stations to closely monitor the water situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th: The water level of the Yangtze River in Nanjing reached 7.59 meters on the 6th, which is 1.22 meters higher than the water level in the same period last year. The water levels of various rivers and lakes have also risen successively. Various counties are actively preparing for flood control.

A general pre-flood inspection has been carried out on more than 900 kilometers of river embankments in Jiangsu Province. The Provincial Headquarters for Harnessing the Huai River organized an inspection team to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the Huai River basin, including Hongze Lake in northern Jiangsu, and eleven large culvert gate projects such as the Sanhe Sluice Gate. Flood control materials are being rushed for transportation. Some dangerous sections are already undergoing emergency repairs.
