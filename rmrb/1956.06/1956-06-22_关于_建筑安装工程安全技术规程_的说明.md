    Explanation of "Safety Technical Regulations for Building Installation Engineering"
    Minister of Labor, Ma Wenrui
    1. Why was the "Safety Technical Regulations for Building Installation Engineering" formulated?
    With the development of national economic construction and the increasing burden of basic construction tasks, various regions and some industrial sectors have successively formulated and promulgated safety and health measures for construction projects. This has played a positive role in promoting safety and health work in construction projects, to a certain extent ensuring the life safety and physical health of employees, inspiring their enthusiasm for labor, and improving labor productivity. However, among the existing measures, the safety and health requirement standards vary, with some requirements being too high, exceeding actual needs, and increasing costs, while others have standards that are too low to ensure safety. At the same time, there is extreme inconsistency between regions, between industrial sectors, and between regions and industrial sectors, resulting in various different standards within the same region or industry, making it quite difficult to implement them specifically.
    In order to overcome the above contradictions and meet the urgent needs of construction, our ministry, based on the existing measures implemented in various regions and departments and with reference to the advanced experience of Soviet construction, drafted the "Safety Technical Regulations for Building Installation Engineering" and submitted it to the State Council for approval and promulgation as a unified basis for all parts of the country and all industries to improve safety technology work during construction. The health requirements in construction projects will be formulated separately by the Ministry of Health.
    2. The Nature and Scope of Application of these Regulations
    These regulations only stipulate the standards for safety technical facilities during the construction process of building installation projects. They are applicable to construction units for industrial and civil construction: that is, all construction units for factory buildings and residential, cultural and welfare, public buildings, commercial, and other civil housing construction. As for new railway and highway projects, water conservancy projects, waterway projects, port construction projects, and mine construction projects, due to the special nature of their construction, they are temporarily not included in the scope of application of these regulations and should be subject to separate measures formulated by the competent authorities with reference to these regulations to suit their respective enterprises. The safety technical requirements for the affiliated enterprises of construction units (such as woodworking factories and concrete mixing plants) may be implemented with reference to the "Factory Safety and Health Regulations".
    3. Several Major Contents of these Regulations
    The scope of construction is very broad, and there are many safety technology issues involved. Based on the situation of the past few years in which the most fatal accidents occurred in construction (such as collapses, earthwork cave-ins, falls from heights, object strikes, and electric shocks), we have focused on making clearer provisions for several major parts with common characteristics in these aspects (such as scaffolding, earthwork, mechanical and electrical equipment, and demolition projects), and have tried as much as possible to stipulate appropriate standards. The part related to construction management (such as general safety requirements for construction and construction sites) puts forward principled requirements.
    In terms of protective equipment, these regulations make clear provisions for major types of work based on the principle of "supply whatever must be used"; for types of work with similar natures, principled provisions are made. As for types of work that are the same as those in production plants, the distribution standards for their protective equipment should be handled in accordance with the "Factory Safety and Health Regulations".
    Regarding fire prevention measures at construction sites, it is recommended that the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Construction Engineering formulate them separately.

    关于“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”的说明
    劳动部长　马文瑞
    一、为什么要制订“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”
    随着国家经济建设的发展，基本建设任务的日益繁重，各地区和部分产业部门均先后制订并颁布了关于建筑工程方面的安全卫生办法，这对推动建筑工程安全卫生工作起了积极的作用，在一定程度上保障了职工的生命安全和身体健康，鼓舞了职工的劳动热情，提高了劳动生产率。但是，在现有的一些办法中，其安全卫生的要求标准有高有低，有的要求过高，超过了实际需要，增加了成本，有的标准定得过低，不能保证安全；同时，地区与地区间、产业与产业间、地区与产业间均极不一致，造成同一地区内或同一产业内有各种不同的标准，具体执行时颇感困难。
    为了克服上述矛盾，并适应建筑施工的迫切需要，我部在各地区、各部门实施现有办法的基础上，参照苏联建筑施工中的先进经验，草拟了“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”，提请国务院会议批准发布，以作为全国各地、各产业改善施工过程中安全技术工作的统一依据。至于建筑工程中的卫生要求，由卫生部另行制定。
    二、本规程的性质和适用范围
    本规程只是有关建筑安装工程施工过程中的安全技术设施标准的规定。适用于工业及民用建设的施工单位：即一切工厂建筑及住宅、文化福利、公共建筑、商业和其他民用房屋建筑的施工单位。至于铁路、公路的新线工程和水利工程、航道工程、筑港工程以及矿井建设工程，因施工性质特殊，暂不包括在本规程的适用范围内，应由各该主管部门参照本规程制订适合各该企业的单行的办法。关于施工单位的附属企业（如木工加工厂、混凝土搅拌厂）的安全技术要求，可参照“工厂安全卫生规程”执行。
    三、本规程的几个主要内容
    建筑施工的范围很广，所涉及的安全伤技术问题很多。根据几年来建筑施工中亡事故最多的几个方面（如倒塌、土方塌陷、高空坠落、物体打击及触电）的情况，我们着重的把这些方面带有共同性的几个主要部分（如脚手架、土石方工程、机电设备以及拆除工程）作了较明确的规定，而且尽可能地规定了适当的标准。其属于施工管理方面的部分（如施工的一般安全要求、施工现场）则提出了原则性的要求。
    在防护用品方面，本规程根据“必须使用的就供给”的原则将主要工种作出明确规定；对工作性质类同的工种则作了原则性的规定。至于与生产厂相同的工种，其防护用品的发放标准，均应按“工厂安全卫生规程”办理。
    关于建筑工地防火措施，建议由公安部、建筑工程部另行制订。
