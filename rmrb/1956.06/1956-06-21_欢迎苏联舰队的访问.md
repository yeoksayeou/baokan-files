    Welcome the Visit of the Soviet Fleet

    The news of the Soviet fleet's first visit to our country at the invitation of our government has filled our people with extraordinary excitement and joy. This fleet, led by Vice Admiral V.A. Chekurov, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Chinese people warmly welcome the friendly visit of the fleet from our great ally and extend our highest respect to the glorious Soviet Navy comrades.

    The powerful Soviet army is an important guarantee of world peace. In the memory of mankind, the immortal feats of the Soviet army in the anti-fascist war will forever remain. In this arduous and just war, the Soviet army gloriously defended the freedom and independence of its motherland and liberated many countries and peoples from the dark rule and enslavement of fascism, making extremely important contributions to the cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism. These immortal feats are, of course, inseparable from the heroic struggles and sacrifices of the officers and soldiers of the valiant Soviet Navy. The Soviet Navy and all the Soviet armed forces are loved and respected by the people of the world.

    The people of China and the Soviet Union have forged an eternal and unbreakable friendship in the common cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. This friendship is not only a great force for promoting the common prosperity and progress of our two countries, but also an important factor in maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people will also never forget the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet people to our socialist cause. The Chinese people will always remember that during the arduous years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Soviet people gave their precious blood for China's independence and freedom. In the final stages of the anti-fascist war, it was the powerful and heroic Soviet army that crushed the main force of the Japanese invading army and liberated tens of millions of people in Northeast China from the ravages of the Japanese invaders. To defend our young People's Republic, the Soviet army generously assisted our country in undertaking the important task of guarding the Lushunkou naval base and preventing the resurgence of imperialist aggression. Thanks to the efforts of the Chinese people and the assistance of the Soviet Union, our country is rapidly advancing towards the road of socialism. At present, the fraternal friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union are constantly developing and consolidating. This friendly visit of the Soviet fleet will further strengthen the fraternal friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union and contribute to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

    Recently, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries have continuously strived to strengthen understanding and cooperation among the peoples of all countries in various ways, thereby leading to a definite easing of international tensions. In order to strengthen peaceful friendship with the peoples of various countries, the Soviet Union has recently sent its fleet to various countries for friendly visits on several occasions. Last year, the Soviet fleet visited the United Kingdom, and this year, the Soviet fleet visited countries such as Yugoslavia and Albania. All these visits have been warmly welcomed by the people of the visited countries. The friendly visits of the Soviet fleet to various countries, symbolizing the powerful force for defending peace, will strengthen the confidence of the people of all countries in defending peace and encourage the enthusiasm of the people of all countries in defending peace, and will play a significant role in promoting understanding and cooperation among the peoples of various countries and further easing international tensions.

    This time, the Soviet fleet will pay an official five-day visit to Shanghai, and will conduct extensive contacts and get-togethers with the citizens of Shanghai and the naval forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai. Undoubtedly, these activities will increase the understanding between the people and navies of China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people and the Chinese Navy will receive our distinguished guests with unparalleled enthusiasm and fraternal friendship. The Chinese people and the Chinese Navy will also learn the great spirit of internationalism from the glorious warriors who defend peace—the Soviet Navy comrades.

    While welcoming the visit of the Soviet fleet led by Vice Admiral V.A. Chekurov to our country, we congratulate the further development and consolidation of the fraternal friendship and unity between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union.

    欢迎苏联舰队的访问
    苏联舰队应我国政府邀请第一次访问我国的消息传出后，我国人民感到异常的兴奋和喜悦。由瓦·安·切库罗夫海军中将率领的这支舰队已经在昨天抵达上海了。我国人民热烈欢迎我们伟大友邦的舰队的友好访问，并向光荣的苏联海军兄弟们致以崇高的敬意。
    强大的苏联军队是世界和平的重要保证。在人类的记忆里，永远留着苏联军队在反法西斯战争中的不朽功勋。苏联军队在这次艰苦的正义的战争中，光荣地捍卫了祖国的自由和独立，并把许多国家和人民从法西斯的暗无天日的统治和奴役下解放出来，对世界和平、民主和社会主义的事业作出了极其重要的贡献。这种不朽的功勋当然是同英勇的苏联海军官兵们的英勇奋斗和流血牺牲分不开的。苏联海军和苏联全部武装力量受到全世界人民的热爱和尊敬。
    中苏两国人民在和平、民主和社会主义的共同事业中结成了永恒的和牢不可破的友谊。这种友谊不仅是促进我们两国的共同繁荣和进步的巨大力量，而且是维护远东和全世界和平的重要因素。中国人民也永远不能忘记苏联人民对我国社会主义事业的伟大无私的援助。中国人民永远记得：在艰苦的抗日战争年代里，苏联人民的优秀子弟曾为我国的独立自由付出了宝贵的鲜血。在反法西斯战争的最后阶段，是强大英勇的苏联军队击溃了日本侵略军的主力，把我国东北几千万人民从日本侵略者的蹂躏下解放了出来。为了保卫我们年轻的人民共和国，苏联军队又慷慨地协助我国担负起守卫旅顺口海防，防止帝国主义侵略再起的重大任务。由于我国人民的努力和苏联的援助，我们的国家正在迅速地向社会主义的道路迈进。目前，中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊和团结正在不断发展和巩固，苏联舰队这次的友好访问，一定会进一步加强中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊和团结，有助于远东和全世界的和平事业。
    最近以来，苏联和其他爱好和平的国家不断努力，用各种方式来加强各国人民之间的了解和合作，从而使国际紧张局势有了肯定的缓和。苏联为加强同各国人民间的和平友谊，最近时期曾数次派遣自己的舰队到各国进行友好访问。去年苏联舰队曾访问了英国，今年苏联舰队又访问了南斯拉夫和阿尔巴尼亚等国家。所有这些访问，都受到了被访问国家人民的热烈欢迎。象征着保卫和平的强大力量的苏联舰队对各国的友好访问，将加强各国人民保卫和平的信心，鼓舞各国人民保卫和平的热情；对增进各国人民之间的了解和合作，进一步缓和国际紧张局势起着重大的作用。
    这次苏联舰队将在上海进行为期五天的正式访问，同上海市民和中国人民解放军驻上海的海军部队进行广泛的接触和联欢。无疑的，这些活动将会增加中苏两国人民和海军之间的了解。中国人民和中国海军将以无比的热情和兄弟般的友谊来接待我们的贵宾。中国人民和中国海军也将从光荣的保卫和平的战士——苏联海军兄弟们的身上学习伟大的国际主义精神。
    在欢迎由瓦·安·切库罗夫海军中将率领的苏联舰队访问我国的时候，我们祝贺中苏两国人民和军队的兄弟般的友谊和团结进一步地发展和巩固。
