Over 80% of Agricultural Cooperatives in Shanxi Province Have Rectified Financial Management

The Broad Masses of Youth Launch "Strive to Be an Outstanding Member" Campaign

(Our Newspaper) News: More than 80% of the 19,000-plus agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province have rectified their financial management work in accordance with the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. Currently, more than 15,800 cooperatives across the province have settled old accounts and established new ones. In the Changzhi Special District, 75% of the cooperatives have conducted financial planning after calculating three accounts: increased production, investment, and member income.

During the rectification work, all localities tightened non-productive expenditures and capital construction investments, appropriately streamlined financial accounting institutions, and addressed some cases of embezzlement and squandering of public funds through government action, eliminating extravagant and wasteful practices. Many cooperatives in the Jinan Special District, during the rectification of financial work, formulated new financial revenue and expenditure plans and necessary systems to address discovered loopholes. More than 3,000 cooperatives throughout the district reduced unqualified or unnecessary accounting personnel, freeing up 8,870-plus people to participate in production. The Longwa Village Five-Star Cooperative in Hunyuan County reduced savable expenses by more than 60,000 yuan, lowering the investment ratio to 13% of total income, and increasing members' income from one yuan per labor day to one yuan and thirty cents.

(Our Newspaper) News: Forty-six counties and cities in Shanxi Province, including Xiaxian, Fenyang, and Xiyang, have recently launched a mass campaign to "Strive to Be an Outstanding Member."

This campaign was initiated by six young people in Shanxi Province, including Ren Huanhai. In their initiative, they proposed conditions such as modeling compliance with cooperative regulations, actively participating in agricultural production increase competitions, each male laborer completing 250 to 300 labor days, and each female laborer completing 120 to 170 labor days; and diligently studying agricultural technology and culture.

Under the active leadership of youth league organizations at all levels, the slogan of striving to be an outstanding member has gradually transformed into practical actions of the broad masses of rural youth. Young people in agricultural cooperatives in Gaoping and Xiaxian, who previously disregarded the quality of work in order to earn more work points, conducted quality labor competitions and strived to be outstanding members after the youth league organizations held forums and conducted cooperative love education, making them understand that this practice was not beneficial to themselves or the cooperative. Thirteen young people in Dazhai Township, Xiyang County, seeing that the weather was turning cloudy, transported 30,000 jin of hay that was placed in the open air back to the hay shed overnight, avoiding losses. Currently, more than 320 outstanding young members and production activists have emerged in counties such as Qinshui, Fenyang, and Gaoping.

    山西省80％以上的农业合作社整顿了财务管理工作
    广大青年展开“争取作个优秀社员”的运动
    本报讯　山西省一万九千多个农业生产合作社，有80％以上的社按照勤俭办社方针整顿了财务管理工作。目前，全省已经有一万五千八百多个社结算了旧账，建立了新账。长治专区有75％的社，通过算增产、算投资和算社员收入的三笔账后，都进行了财务规划。
    在整顿工作中，各地都紧缩了非生产性的开支和基本建设投资，适当精简了财务会计机构，并且通过政府处理了一些贪污和挥霍公款等事件，消除了铺张浪费现象。晋南专区许多社在整顿财务工作的时候，针对发现的漏洞，重新制定了财务收支计划和必要的制度。全区三千多个社裁减了不称职或不必要的会计人员，腾出八千八百七十多人参加了生产。浑源县龙洼村五星社，缩减了能够节省的费用六万多元，使投资比例降到占总收入的13％，社员的收入由每个劳动日分红一元增加到一元三角。
    本报讯　山西省夏县、汾阳、昔阳等四十六个县、市，最近开展了群众性的“争取作个优秀社员”的运动。
    这个运动是山西省任焕孩等六个青年倡议的。他们在倡议中提出了要模范地遵守社章，积极参加农业增产竞赛，每个男劳动力要做250到300个劳动日，女劳动力要做120到170个劳动日；努力学习农业技术和文化等条件。
    在各级团组织的积极领导下，争取作个优秀社员的口号，目前已经逐步变成了广大农村青年的实际行动。高平、夏县等地农业合作社的青年，过去不顾工活质量，抢赚工分，经过团组织召开座谈会进行了爱社教育后，青年们认识了这种做法对自己和社都没好处，开展了保质保量的劳动竞赛，争取作个优秀社员。昔阳县大寨乡的十三个青年，看到天阴了，他们就星夜把放在露天地上的三万斤干草运回了草房，避免了损失。目前沁水、汾阳、高平等县已经出现三百二十多个青年优秀社员和生产积极分子。
