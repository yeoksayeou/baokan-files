Xinhua News Agency Report: “We have come from afar, thousands of miles, to offer this flower blooming on the southwestern border—滇 Opera—to the audiences in the capital." This was stated by the famous 滇 Opera actors Bi Jinyu, Qi Shaobin, and others at a symposium held on the 5th by the Chinese Dramatists Association.

At this symposium, many figures from the art circles in Beijing expressed a warm welcome to the Yunnan Province 滇 Opera Troupe for their performances in Beijing. They commented on the scripts, performances, music, stage art, and other aspects of the three excerpts performed by the 滇 Opera Troupe on the evening of the 4th specifically for people in the literary and art circles: "Lotus Match," "Niu Gao Tears Up the Decree," and "Borrowing a Wedding Match." They unanimously praised the unique artistic style, rich local color, and strong sense of life of 滇 Opera.

Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, spoke at the symposium. He said that in recent years, under the leadership of the relevant departments in Yunnan Province, the 滇 Opera Troupe has correctly implemented the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," which has enriched and developed 滇 Opera. He hoped that the 滇 Opera Troupe and the artists in Beijing would learn from each other and improve together.

滇 Opera has a history of about 130 years, with about 1,000 plays, the most popular of which are small plays with the theme of people's lives. The performing art of 滇 Opera has an excellent tradition. The actors play their roles starting from life, paying attention to portraying the characters' personalities and thoughts and feelings. 滇 Opera is popular in most parts of Yunnan Province, and there are mass amateur 滇 Opera troupes and other organizations in larger towns. The Yunnan Province 滇 Opera Troupe was officially established in 1953. In addition to gathering a group of veteran artists, it has also cultivated many talented young actors.

The 滇 Opera Troupe arrived in Beijing on May 29th and will begin its public performances at the Beijing People's Theater on the 8th.

    滇剧获得首都文艺界的赞赏
    新华社讯　我们不远千里而来，是为了把这朵开放在西南边疆的鲜花——滇剧，献给首都观众。这是著名滇剧演员碧金玉、戚少斌等五日在中国戏剧家协会召开的座谈会上说的。
    在这个座谈会上，北京的许多艺术界人士对云南省滇剧团来北京演出表示热烈欢迎。他们对滇剧团四日晚上专为文艺界人士表演的“荷花配”、“牛皋扯旨”和“借婚配”三个剧目的剧本、表演、音乐、舞台美术等方面发表评论，一致赞美了滇剧独特的艺术风格、浓厚的地方色彩和生活气息。
    文化部副部长刘芝明在座谈会上讲了话。他说，滇剧团这几年来在云南省有关部门领导下正确执行“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，使滇剧得到了丰富和发展。他希望滇剧团和北京的艺术家们互相学习，共同提高。
    滇剧约有一百三十多年历史，剧目有一千个左右，其中最流行的是以人民生活为题材的小戏。滇剧的表演艺术有着优良的传统，演员们扮演角色都从生活出发，注意刻划人物的性格和思想感情。滇剧流行在云南省内绝大部分地区，较大的城镇都有群众业余滇剧团等组织。云南省滇剧团是在1953年正式成立的，除集中一批老艺人外，还培养了许多有才能的青年演员。
    滇剧团是五月二十九日来到北京的，八日将开始在北京人民剧场公演。
