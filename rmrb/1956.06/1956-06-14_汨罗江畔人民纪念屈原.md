    People Commemorate Qu Yuan on the Banks of the Miluo River
    (Our newspaper Changsha dispatch on the 13th) The people on both banks of the Miluo River in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, commemorated Qu Yuan today according to traditional customs. Early in the morning, families in Heshi Township along the Miluo River inserted mugwort branches on their doors and windows, and the children put on new clothes and hung sachets. The aroma of zongzi wafted from the doorways of every household.
    For several days, dragon boats have been launched on the Miluo River one after another. In the Quzi Temple on Yusu Mountain, where Qu Yuan lived during his lifetime, people who row boats carry dragon heads to the temple to pay homage every day.
    The wonderful dragon boat race in Heshi Township started this afternoon. All twelve dragon boats in the township sped on the Miluo River in the afternoon, and thousands of people on both banks watched the dragon boat race in new clothes and holding sun umbrellas.
    Today, the agricultural producers' cooperative and primary school in this township are closed for a day as usual.

    汨罗江畔人民纪念屈原
    本报长沙13日电　湖南省湘阴县汨罗江两岸人民，今天按照传统风俗，纪念屈原。清晨，汨罗江边的河市乡各家门窗上都插上了艾枝，孩子们穿上了新衣，挂了香荷包。粽子的香味，从各家门口传出来。
    几天以来，汨罗江上不断有龙船下水，在屈原生前住过的玉笥山上的屈子祠里，每天都有划船的人，抬着龙头，到这里来朝庙。
    河市乡精采的龙舟竞渡是今天下午开始的。全乡十二条龙船，在午后即飞驰在汨罗江上，两岸有数千人穿着新衣，撑着避阳伞，观看龙舟竞渡。
    今天，这个乡的农业生产合作社和小学都按照习惯放假一天。
