	Ambassador Ahmed's Eulogy

Your Excellency, I have the honor to present to you the letter of credence by which the first president of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has happily appointed me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China.

The President of Pakistan has instructed me to convey to Your Excellency his high respect and sincere friendship, to wish you good health and success in all matters, and to congratulate the people of your great country on their achievements and progress. At the same time, please allow me to express my deep admiration to Your Excellency, your government, and the great Chinese people.

The establishment of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a milestone in our country's progress towards a way of life that is in accordance with the ardent aspirations of our people. The constitution establishing this republic is based on the lofty ideals of maintaining and promoting world peace, that is, the ideal of closer understanding between countries and the increasing happiness and well-being of the people. I assure Your Excellency that the sentiments that prompted my compatriots to formulate this noble constitution will not be diminished in my execution of the sacred duty of promoting closer amity and understanding between the Governments of the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and between the two peoples.

Your Excellency, I am not a stranger in your great country. As the Ambassador of the Dominion of Pakistan, I have had the honor of constantly receiving the care and assistance of your government in the performance of my duties. I have also constantly perceived the great desire of Your Excellency's government to establish more friendly and close relations with all countries, which is also an ideal that the Pakistani government equally possesses and cherishes.

Your Excellency, we are neighbors, and there are records of our close and good relations in ancient history. In recent years, during the awakening of Asian countries, the Pakistani government has been striving for the cause of peace and increased understanding between countries. At the historic Bandung Conference, the Pakistani government cooperated with the People's Republic of China and other Asian and African countries in the cause of peace and increased understanding between countries. Recently, the government and people of Pakistan had the honor of receiving Madam Soong Ching Ling and Marshal He Long. There have also been many cultural exchanges between our two governments and peoples that have brought us closer. Accepting the kind invitation from your government for our Prime Minister to visit your great country is a matter of great joy for my compatriots. His upcoming visit will mark a further development in the cooperation between our two governments and peoples in accordance with the ideals of the Bandung Conference. To this end, please allow me to assure Your Excellency that, in my capacity as my country's representative stationed in your great country, I am willing to continuously strive to strengthen the friendly relations and active cooperation between our two countries in accordance with the ideals of peace that are cherished by our two peoples and governments.

In order to achieve success in this endeavor, I need the cooperation of Your Excellency's government, and I have no doubt that I will receive the full and sincere cooperation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, just as I have received in the past.

	Chairman Mao Zedong's Reply

Ambassador,

I am very pleased to accept the Letter of Credence appointing you as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to the People's Republic of China, and I thank Your Excellency and the President of your country for your kindness and congratulations to our government and people and to myself.

The People's Republic of China has consistently sought to establish and develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and pursues a good-neighborly policy towards all neighboring countries. The Chinese government and people are pleased to see that China and Pakistan have maintained friendly relations since the establishment of diplomatic relations, and that trade, cultural exchanges, and mutual friendly visits between the two countries are constantly developing.

Our government and I welcome Your Excellency's new appointment. We cherish the efforts Your Excellency has made over the past year or more to strengthen the friendship between China and Pakistan and are willing to continue to give Your Excellency our full assistance in this regard.

I wish Your Excellency new achievements in your work. I wish your country prosperity, your people happiness, and your head of state good health!

        阿哈默德大使的颂词
    阁下，我荣幸地向您递交巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国第一任总统高兴地任命我为驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书。
    巴基斯坦总统嘱托我向阁下转达他的崇高敬意和诚挚友谊，祝贺您身体健康诸事顺遂，祝贺您的伟大国家的人民获得成就和进步，同时，请允许我向阁下、您的政府和伟大的中国人民，表示我个人的深切敬慕之意。
    巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的成立是我国在向着符合于我国人民热烈愿望的生活方式前进中的里程碑。创立这个共和国的宪法是基于维护和促进世界和平的崇高理想，就是使国与国之间更紧密地了解，使人民日益幸福和安康的理想。我向阁下保证，促使我国同胞制定这个高贵宪法的情操，在我执行增进中华人民共和国和巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国政府之间和两国人民间的更加密切的友谊和了解的神圣职责中，将不会有所减逊。
    阁下，我在伟大的贵国并不是一个陌生者，我作为巴基斯坦自治领的大使，在执行职务时，曾经荣幸地不断获得您的政府的关怀和帮助。我也曾经不断觉察到阁下政府具有同一切国家建立更加友好和密切联系的伟大愿望，这也是巴基斯坦政府同样具有和珍视的理想。
    阁下，我们是邻国，在远古的历史上，就有着我们密切和良好联系的记载。在亚洲国家觉醒中的近几年来，巴基斯坦政府一直为和平和国与国之间增进了解的事业而奋斗。在具有历史意义的万隆会议上，巴基斯坦政府在和平和国与国之间增进了解的事业中，同中华人民共和国和其他亚非国家进行了合作。近来，巴基斯坦政府和人民荣幸地接待了宋庆龄女士阁下和贺龙元帅阁下，我们两国政府和人民间还有过多次使我们更加接近的文化交流。接受你们政府请我们总理访问伟大贵国的善意邀请，对我国同胞来说，是一件莫大喜悦的事。他的不久后的访问将在我们两国政府和人民按照万隆会议的理想进行的合作中，标志出进一步的开展。为此，请允许我向阁下保证，我以我国派驻在伟大贵国的代表的身份，将愿意按照我们两国人民和两国政府所共同珍惜的和平理想，为加强我们两国之间的友好关系和积极合作而不断努力。
    为了使我在这种努力中得到成就，我需要阁下政府的合作，我毫不怀疑，我将会得到中华人民共和国政府的全力和诚挚的合作，正像我过去所得到的一样。
        毛泽东主席的答词大使先生：
    我很高兴地接受阁下被任命为巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书，并且感谢阁下和贵国总统对我国政府和人民以及我本人的好意和祝贺。
    中华人民共和国一贯寻求在平等互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的基础上建立和发展同一切国家的友好关系，并且对所有邻国执行睦邻政策。中国政府和人民高兴地看到，中国同巴基斯坦自从建立外交关系以来，一直保持着友好关系，两国的贸易文化交流和相互友好访问正不断地得到发展。
    我国政府和我本人欢迎阁下的新任。我们珍视阁下在过去一年多来为加强中巴两国友谊所作的努力，并且愿意在这方面继续给阁下以充分的协助。
    祝阁下在工作中获得新的成就。祝贵国国家繁荣、人民幸福、贵国元首健康！
