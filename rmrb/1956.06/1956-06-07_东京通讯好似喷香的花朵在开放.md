　　Like Fragrant Flowers in Bloom
　　By Our Correspondent Pei Da

　　"After seeing your country's artists perform, I am very happy! You have played a significant role in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Your performances, singing, and costumes are all beautiful; your art is both classical and modern, which I greatly admire!" This was what Prince Mikasa, the third brother of the Japanese Emperor, said to Mei Lanfang, head of the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation visiting Japan, on the evening of June 2nd.

　　On the evening of June 2nd, Prince Mikasa and his wife came to the Kabuki-za Theatre in Tokyo to watch Peking Opera. For a full four hours, they, like the rest of the audience, tirelessly enjoyed "The Empty City Stratagem," "Autumn River," "Hunting the Tiger," and "Farewell My Concubine" performed by Mei Lanfang and Yuan Shihai. At the end of the performance, amidst a storm of applause, Prince Mikasa and his wife were the first to leave their seats and specially went backstage to meet Mei Lanfang and Ouyang Yuqian, among others. During the cordial conversation, Prince Mikasa repeatedly praised the art of Peking Opera and extended his greetings to the Chinese artists.

　　By the evening performance of this day, the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation concluded its first performance in Tokyo. During the four days of Peking Opera performances, a wave of enthusiasm for seeing the opera swept through Tokyo. Although the theater only had two thousand five hundred seats, each performance was crowded with several hundred more people. To buy standing-room tickets for the evening performance, one had to queue for seven hours; to buy standing-room tickets for the daytime performance, one had to wait from midnight until dawn. Those at the back of the queue waited even though they had no hope, and eventually quarreled with the ticket seller, whereupon the police rushed to mediate. At the same time, the price of "scalped tickets" rose higher and higher. According to reliable sources, someone bought a front-row ticket for the last Peking Opera performance for 10,000 yen (equivalent to more than 66 yuan in Chinese currency, five and a half times the original price).

　　Among the audience, there were old and young, housewives holding babies, and even those who came to see the opera while ill. Professor Ryukyo Matsunosuke of Tokyo University of Agriculture, who is seventy years old this year, has been resting at home for the past three years due to illness. When the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation led by Mei Lanfang performed, he was so excited that he couldn't lie still. He said when watching the opera on the evening of June 1st: "It is not right to come to see Peking Opera while I am suspended from teaching, but I must definitely come again tomorrow." Many artists were also fascinated and came to see Peking Opera every day. Ms. Yamamoto Yasue, a famous Japanese "New Drama" actress, greatly praised the art of Peking Opera, saying, "Chinese Peking Opera art is a beautification based on reality, the acting is exquisite and refined, exaggerated and realistic. In particular, Mr. Mei's artistic performance, which comes from inner strength, is like fragrant flowers in bloom." She excitedly expressed that her feelings could not be expressed in simple words. She plans to study the many things she has learned in the past few days in order to enrich her own performing arts. At the end of the Peking Opera performance on the evening of June 2nd, she stepped onto the stage with gratitude and presented a bouquet of鲜艳鲜艳 flowers to the head of the Mei Lanfang delegation.

　　These days, public places such as large hotels and restaurants with televisions in Tokyo, as well as many homes, have become "mini Kabuki-za," some even more lively than the large theater. According to people familiar with the television situation, no less than three million people watched Peking Opera on television on the evening of June 1st (about more than double the usual number of people watching television). The usually chaotic bathhouses and dining rooms were almost empty when Peking Opera was performed.

　　The "Kira Shokudo" in Ebara-machi, Shinagawa Ward (a poor district) in Tokyo, has a television set, and every time Peking Opera is broadcast, it is packed with workers and petty citizens.

　　During the Peking Opera performance, the Japanese Diet was only a few days away from closing. The Diet members debated all day long, voted again and again, and sometimes stayed up all night. However, many Diet members quietly slipped out of the Diet and appeared at the Kabuki-za Theater. After watching the evening performance on June 1st, Liberal Democratic Party member Ito Ryuji expressed the following thoughts: "Before the war, I saw a lot of Peking Opera in China. This time, the opera is brighter, richer, and more beautiful than in the past. This can be said to be the impact of China's independence on the national culture! Japan and China have deep economic and cultural ties, which can also be seen from the drama. Such cultural exchanges are more extensive, the people of the two countries are closer, which is good for eliminating unnatural relations."

    好似喷香的花朵在开放

    “看了贵国艺术家的演出，我非常高兴！你们对中日文化交流起了很大的作用。你们的表演、歌唱和服装都很美；你们的艺术是古典的而又是现代化了的，使我非常佩服！”这是日本天皇的三弟三笠宫在六月二日晚上向中国访日京剧代表团梅兰芳团长讲的一番话。
    六月二日晚上，三笠宫和他的夫人来到东京歌舞伎座大剧院观赏京剧。在整整四个钟头内，他们和全场观众一样不知疲倦地欣赏了“空城计”、“秋江”、“猎虎”和梅兰芳、袁世海演出的“霸王别姬”。演出终了，在全场暴风雨般的掌声中，三笠宫和他的夫人抢先离开了座位，特意到后台去会见梅兰芳和欧阳予倩等。在亲切交谈中，三笠宫对京剧艺术连声称赞，并且对中国艺术家致意问候。
    到这一天晚场，中国京剧代表团结束了它在东京的首次公演。在京剧演出的四天中，东京掀起了看剧的热潮。本来剧院只有二千五百个席位，但是每一场都多挤上好几百人。为买晚场站票，要排队站上七个小时；买白天的站票，要从深夜等到天明。排在后边的人，明明没有指望也要等着，最后免不了和售票人争吵一顿，于是警察赶忙前来劝架。与此同时，“转让票”的价钱越来越高。据可靠的消息，有人为了要看最后一场京剧，用日元一万元买了一张前排票（合中国人民币六十六元多，比原价贵五倍半）。
    观众之中，有老有少，有抱着娃娃的主妇，还有带病看戏的。东京农业大学教授龙居松之助，今年七十岁了，最近三年在家养病。当以梅兰芳为首的中国京剧代表团演出之日，他兴奋得躺也躺不住。他在六月一日晚上看戏时说：“在停止教学中来看京剧，实在说不过去，可是我明天还一定要来。”许多艺术家也着了迷似地每天来看京剧。日本“新剧”名演员山本安英女士对京剧艺术极为称赞，她说：“中国京剧艺术是在现实基础上的美化，演技精而又精，夸张而又逼真。特别是梅先生出自内在力量的艺术表演，好似喷香的花朵在开放。”她兴奋地表示，她的感受不能用简单的话来表达。她准备把这几天学到的许多东西加以研究，以便丰富自己的表演艺术。六月二日晚上京剧演出终了时，她怀着感激的心情登上舞台也向梅兰芳团长献上了鲜艳的花束。
    这几天，东京市设有电视机的大旅馆、饭店等公共场所和许多家庭，都变成了“小歌舞伎座”，有的甚至比大剧院还要热闹。据熟悉电视情况的人士谈，六月一日晚上在电视机前看京剧的不下三百万人（约比平常看电视的人多一倍以上）。从来总是乱哄哄的澡堂、饭厅，在京剧上演时几乎空无一人。
    东京品川区（贫民区）荏原町“喜乐食堂”设有一台电视机，每次放映京剧时都挤满了一屋子工人和小市民。
    在京剧演出期间，日本的国会只剩几天就要闭幕了。议员们整天在辩论，一次又一次地投票，有时整夜不眠。但是不少国会议员悄悄地从国会溜出来，出现在歌舞伎座剧院里。自由民主党议员伊东隆治看过六月一日晚场演出之后，发表了以下的感想：“战前，我在中国看过很多京戏。这次的戏，比过去的更明朗、更丰富、更美了。这可以说是中国的独立给国民文化方面的影响吧！日本和中国在经济、文化等方面有深厚的关系，这也可以从戏剧上看得出来。这样的文化交流更广泛，两国的人就更亲密，对消除不自然的关系是有好处的。”
