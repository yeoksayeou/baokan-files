Baoji-Chengdu Railway Only Thirty-odd Kilometers Away from Connecting

Sichuan Province Actively Prepares to Transport Large Quantities of Grain, Fruit, and Local Products

Chengdu, June 2nd (Report from this newspaper) – The track-laying personnel of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway are advancing towards the Huangsha River, and the track-laying project is progressing rapidly. The southern section laid track to the Xuegou Middle Bridge at 15:30 on May 31st, and bridge construction began at 9:00 on June 1st, leaving only 17 kilometers and 400 meters to the Huangsha River junction; the northern section laid rails to Huashan Village on the 31st, leaving only 20 kilometers and 700 meters to the Huangsha River.

Recently, the track-laying workers in the north and south sections launched a socialist competition, and their labor enthusiasm is high, with new records constantly appearing. When laying rails in the Fengjiaba tunnels, the first track-nailing team in the southern section promoted the parallel rail-pulling method, increasing rail-pulling efficiency from a maximum of 350 meters per hour to 500 meters. The youth track-nailing team, due to the rational organization of cyclical operations and the implementation of the joint sleeper-laying method, used only 16.6 man-days to lay one kilometer and 25.5 meters of track in the Chanjue Temple Tunnel, breaking the Ministry of Railways' quota of 19.98 man-days to lay one kilometer of track. On May 30th, the track-laying workers in the southern section laid more than four kilometers and 445 meters of rails. The workers in the bridge-building team have also continuously created new national bridge-building records.

Chengdu, June 2nd (Report from this newspaper) – The Baoji-Chengdu Railway will open to traffic on "July 1st." In recent days, many units have sent people to contact the relevant departments of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway to discuss transportation business after the opening. In the second half of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau will transport 500,000 tons of grain through the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Commercial and trade departments will transport more than 90,000 tons of goods such as white sugar, walnuts, and umbrellas. In addition to transporting 20,000 tons of Guanggan oranges and tangerines, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation will also transport 15,000 tons of chemical fertilizers from other places. The Temporary Management Office of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is actively preparing to handle transportation business after the opening. They have studied the connection of trains and the number of trains to be operated with the Zhengzhou and Lanzhou Railway Administrations; and have established training classes for technical workers in communications, handling, signaling, and road maintenance. The Ministry of Railways has transferred 102 train operation personnel and twelve locomotives from Beijing, Guangzhou, Qiqihar and other places. At present, the temporary management office is rushing to prepare train schedules and conduct inspections of the lines along the way. (Attached picture)

    宝成路只差三十多公里就可接轨通车
    四川省积极准备大量运出粮食、水果和土特产品
    本报成都2日电　宝成铁路铺轨人员正向黄沙河挺进，铺轨工程进展迅速。南段在五月三十一日十五时三十分铺轨到靴沟中桥，六月一日九时开始了架桥工作，离黄沙河接轨点只有十七公里又四百公尺了；北段在三十一日把钢轨铺到华山村，离黄沙河也只有二十公里零七百公尺了。
    最近，南北两段的铺轨职工开展了社会主义竞赛，劳动热情高涨，新纪录不断出现。南段钉道一分队在铺设封家坝三个隧道的钢轨的时候，推广了并肩拉轨法，拉轨效率由每小时最多拉三百五十公尺提高到五百公尺。青年钉道组由于合理地组织了循环作业，推行了联合排枕木的方法，在禅觉寺隧道仅用16·6个人工，一天就铺轨一公里又二五点五公尺，突破了铁道部规定的19·98个人工每天铺轨一公里的定额。五月三十日那天，南段铺轨工人铺设钢轨四公里零四四五公尺多。架桥分队的职工，也连续创造了架桥的全国新纪录。
    本报成都2日电　宝成铁路将在“七一”通车，最近几天，很多单位已经派人来同宝成铁路有关部门接洽通车后的运输业务。今年下半年，四川省粮食厅将要通过宝成铁路运出五十万吨粮食。商业贸易部门要运出白糖、核桃、雨伞等货物九万多吨。四川省供销合作社联合社除了要运出二万吨广柑、橘子以外，还要从外地运来一万五千吨化学肥料。铁道部第二工程局临时管理处正在积极准备办理通车后的运输业务。他们跟郑州、兰州等铁路管理局研究了列车的衔接和开行列车的数量等问题；开办了通讯、搬运、信号、养路等技术工人训练班。铁道部已经从北京、广州、齐齐哈尔等地调来了102名行车人员和十二台机车。现在，临时管理处正在赶制列车运行图和进行沿途线路的检查工作。（附图片）
