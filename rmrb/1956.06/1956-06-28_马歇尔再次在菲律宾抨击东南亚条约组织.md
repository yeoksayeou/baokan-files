Xinhua News Agency, Manila, June 27th: Singapore Labor Front Chairman Marshall once again attacked the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the Philippines on the evening of June 26th. He laughed at Philippine Vice President Garcia's insistence that the organization was a "defense" against Chinese aggression, and asked: Do Philippine people really believe that "Communist China" will attack the Philippines?

Marshall, who was passing through Manila on his way to Japan, said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization would disintegrate, and the only basis for the organization was the Western countries' hope to rely on it to maintain their colonies in Asia.

The former Chief Minister of Singapore also said that the pro-Western Asian governments' attitude of refusing to negotiate with "Communist China" was foolish.

Marshall said that he was first and foremost an Asian, and "if the United States or other Western countries don't like me going to China, it doesn't matter to me."

Marshall also accused the United States government of intending to obtain ownership of its military bases in the Philippines, and he believed that the United States should not occupy land in an independent country that does not belong to the United States.

    马歇尔再次在菲律宾抨击东南亚条约组织
    新华社27日讯　马尼拉消息：新加坡劳工阵线主席马歇尔六月二十六日晚上再一次在菲律宾抨击东南亚条约组织。他对菲律宾副总统加西亚硬说这个组织是“防御”中国侵略的说法付之一笑，并且反问道：菲律宾人士难道真正认为“共产党中国”将会进攻菲律宾吗？
    在前往日本途中经过马尼拉的马歇尔说，东南亚条约组织将会瓦解，这个组织的唯一基础是西方国家希望靠它来保持它们在亚洲的殖民地。
    这位前任新加坡首席部长还说，亲西方的亚洲国家政府拒绝同“共产党中国”进行谈判的态度是愚昧的。
    马歇尔说，他首先是一个亚洲人，“如果美国或其他西方国家不喜欢我前往中国的话，那对我来说是没有什么关系的”。
    马歇尔还指责美国政府打算得到它在菲律宾的军事基地的所有权，他认为美国不应该在一个独立的国家里占有一块不属于美国的土地。
