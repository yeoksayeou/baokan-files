Guangzhou, June 25th (This newspaper dispatch) - Guangdong Province's over 33 million mu of early rice has begun to be harvested, and joyous news of bumper harvests is coming from all directions. The over 4 million mu of Nantao No. 1 early-maturing rice that has already been harvested has generally increased in production by 10% to 30% compared to last year. On the banks of the Han River, known as the "golden land," the average yield per mu last year was 500 jin of grain; this year, it has reached over 550 jin, with some areas reaching 700 jin. In the Pearl River Delta areas such as Zhongshan, Dongguan, and Xinhui counties, the early rice already harvested this year has largely exceeded the yields of previous years. The Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, which have historically had lower yields, have also seen unprecedented high yields this year. In counties such as Baisha, Wanning, and Xuwen, many high-yield fields have reached 1,000 jin per mu. Preliminary estimates indicate that the total summer harvest in the province may increase by about 20% compared to the same period last year.

Currently, the rural areas everywhere are displaying a joyful scene of bumper harvest. Farmers are universally paying attention to careful harvesting and threshing, actively repairing and improving drying grounds and rice threshing tools, and purchasing more grain storage baskets. In the Shaoguan area, more than 560 cooperatives have organized harvesting teams, drying teams, and transportation teams, using assembly-line methods to achieve quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick drying, and quick storage, ensuring that every grain belongs to the cooperative and is safely stored in the granary.

    本报广州25日电　广东省三千三百多万亩早稻已经开镰收割，丰收的喜讯从四面八方传来。各地已收割的四百多万亩南特号早熟稻，普遍比去年增产一成至三成。被称为“黄金色土地”的韩江两岸，去年平均每亩收谷五百斤，今年收到五百五十多斤，有些达到七百斤。珠江三角洲的中山、东莞、新会等县，今年已收的早稻大部超过了历年的产量。历来产量较低的雷州半岛和海南岛，今年也出现了从未有过的高额产量。白沙、万宁、徐闻等县有许多丰产田每亩达到了一千斤。据初步估计，全省夏收作物可比去年同期增产20％左右。
    现在，各地农村到处呈现出一片丰收的欢乐景象。农民在收割时普遍注意细收细打，积极进行修补晒场、打禾桶和添购储谷筐。韶关专区有五百六十多个社组织了割禾队、晒谷队、搬运队等，用流水作业的方法实行快收、快打、快晒、快藏，做到颗粒归社，安全入仓。
