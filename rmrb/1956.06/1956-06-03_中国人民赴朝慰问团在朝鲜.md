The Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea
Wang Ziyi, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea

I

In February 1956, taking advantage of the Spring Festival and the Korean People's Army's "February 8th" Army Day, our people once again organized a delegation to North Korea to express their regards to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who were working tirelessly to maintain the Korean Armistice, strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and protect peace in the Far East and the world. The delegation included representatives from the government, trade unions, women's federations, youth leagues, industry and commerce federations, literary and art federations, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army; there were industrial and agricultural labor models, advanced workers, young socialist construction activists, activists in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, as well as family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldier models; and there were also thirteen literary and artistic troupes, including opera, song and dance, acrobatics, and folk art.

We began our visits to various units of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in early February, and the entire work was not completed until the end of April. During this period, we participated in the celebrations of the Korean People's Army's "February 8th" Army Day held in Pyongyang and Kaesong. Then, we visited and performed for the leading organs above the division level of the Korean People's Army and the People's Army troops, as well as the Korean people in the troop garrison areas. During the Spring Festival, the comrades of the delegation spent the festival with the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army in various units. The delegation visited positions such as Shangganling, Eagle Peak, Goseong, and Dingzi Mountain, extending greetings to the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who were stationed on the front lines. The delegation also visited rear service troops, logistics units, and transportation units. Report meetings and performances were held in places where troops were concentrated; visits and small-scale performances were also conducted on scattered positions, construction sites, hospitals, kitchens, and Volunteer Army trains; some even extended greetings to troops stationed on islands through telephone and broadcasting. During this period, we swept the tombs of the martyrs of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in various places, the Liberation Memorial Tower in Pyongyang, and the tombs of internationalist soldiers such as Park Jae-geun and Luo Shengjiao, and also focused on visiting the families of Korean martyrs and models of support for the army. Through activities such as consolation meetings, report meetings, symposiums, and consolation performances, we conveyed the deep affection of the Chinese people for the Korean People's Army, the Korean people, and the Chinese People's Volunteers. It can be said that the glorious task of consolation entrusted to us by the people of the whole country has been successfully completed.

The delegation's activities over the past two months have further enhanced the close friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples and encouraged the fighting will of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The broad masses of Korean People's Army officers and soldiers and Korean people who met with us kindly entrusted us to convey their sincere friendship and brotherly concern to our people; after hearing reports from the representatives on the specific situation of the high tide of socialist revolution in the motherland and the care of the people of the whole country for them, the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers expressed to the comrades of the delegation their firm determination to defend the motherland and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The delegation received tens of thousands of letters and a large number of gifts and souvenirs from the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Korean people, fully expressing their unparalleled love for the entire Chinese people.

During our visit and consolation in Korea, we felt infinite admiration for the efforts and achievements of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean military and civilians over the past few years in maintaining peace, striving for the reunification of the motherland, and restoring and developing the national economy in the northern half.

Since the armistice, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Korean people, and the People's Army have consistently and faithfully implemented all the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and have actively put forward various reasonable proposals for consolidating peace in Korea and realizing national reunification. However, the American aggressor group and Syngman Rhee have rejected all peaceful proposals. They are still actively engaged in arms expansion and war preparations, creating tensions in an attempt to launch a surprise attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, they have done everything possible to obstruct, restrict, and sabotage the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In this way, peace in Korea is seriously threatened.

Under these circumstances, in order to protect the security of the peaceful construction of both China and Korea, the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers are closely united, sticking to their fighting posts, continuing to vigilantly watch the enemy's conspiracies, and taking all measures to stop the enemy's provocations. During our visits and condolences at various front-line positions, we saw how the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were arduously guarding their positions. During our stay in Korea, we encountered several heavy snowfalls and severe weather, with the mountain peaks of the forward posts reaching minus 30 degrees Celsius. However, everyone was full of energy and firm in their will, never relaxing their vigilance against the enemy in the slightest; they braved strong winds and heavy snow, standing guard and patrolling day and night, closely monitoring the enemy's activities; the troops guarding the coast and islands overcame all kinds of difficulties with strong perseverance and completed their guard duties. Thanks to their joint efforts over the past few years, they have reliably guaranteed the stability of the military demarcation line and protected the peaceful construction of China and Korea.

Under the slogan of "Everything for strengthening the democratic base," the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have used their labor and wisdom to heal the wounds of war and rapidly develop the national economy. In the few years since the armistice, great achievements have been made in reconstruction work, and towns and villages that had been severely damaged during the war have been rebuilt at an astonishing rate. In the industrial field, in just two years after the armistice, more than 230 power plants, mines, steel smelters, machinery manufacturing plants, chemical plants, etc. that had been damaged during the war were all restored, and more than 60 newly built industrial enterprises with advanced technical equipment were put into production. The total output value of state-owned and cooperative industries increased by 2.5 times compared with the first half of 1953. In the agricultural field, the vast farmland destroyed and abandoned due to the war was restored, the irrigated area was increased by about 40,000 hectares, and the number of agricultural machinery cultivation stations in the first half of 1955 increased by 2.6 times compared with the first half of 1953. The number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives has exceeded 44%. In terms of transportation, 749 kilometers of railways were restored and newly built in the two years after the war, and the volume of freight transportation in the first half of 1955 increased by 84% compared with the first half of 1953, and the volume of highway freight transportation increased by 4.7 times. With the rapid development of production, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has lowered prices four times since the armistice, increasing the actual wages of employees by more than two times. The lives of farmers have also been greatly improved. We once visited the Mangyongdae Agricultural Production Cooperative near Pyongyang and the Jangyo-ri Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Pyonggang area. Every household that joined the cooperative had surplus grain, and their lives were getting better day by day. In the process of restoration and construction, countless advanced producers and advanced workers have emerged among the Korean people, and many people have been awarded medals and badges by the state. During our visits to various places, we could see the flourishing construction scene and the enthusiastically working Korean people everywhere.

While engaged in peaceful construction, the Korean people have warmly cared for and actively supported the Chinese People's Volunteers. From the armistice to 1955, according to incomplete statistics, party and government organs and people's organizations at all levels in Korea sent delegations, art troupes, and film teams to visit the Volunteer Army troops and construction sites more than 1,800 times during festivals and peacetime, performed literary and art programs and screened films more than 5,200 times, and sent more than 130,000 consolation letters and 294,000 consolation items, more than 726,000 jin of various foods, and more than 134,000 jin of vegetables. When building the Aishan River and Anrong River dikes, more than 500 women fetched well water from five or six miles away to boil water for the Volunteer Army troops to drink, and more than 200 literary and art workers went to various construction sites to perform consolation performances. Since the armistice, the Korean government has continued to award various medals and badges to meritorious personnel of the Volunteer Army, and the people of various places in Korea have selected appropriate places for the Volunteer Army martyrs and built martyrs' cemeteries. The Korean government and people named various projects helped by the Volunteer Army as "China-Korea Friendship Dam," "Combat Friendship Bridge," "Fourteen Warriors Canal," and so on. During our visit to the Korean people, Korean parents asked us to tell the families of the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers: "Your children in Korea are being taken care of by us, please rest assured."

III

During these days of living with the Volunteer Army in various units, we deeply felt the noble qualities and great spirit of the entire Volunteer Army officers and soldiers in serving the motherland and the cause of peace with loyalty, which deeply moved us.

Since the Korean Armistice, in addition to strictly guarding the positions together with the Korean People's Army, the Volunteers have continued to highly display the great spirit of internationalism and patriotism and revolutionary heroism, as in the past, in their studies, in supporting the construction of the motherland, and in helping the Korean people restore construction.

In order to better shoulder the task of defending peace, all officers and soldiers launched intense studies. After more than two years of efforts, their military literacy, political awareness, and cultural level have all been significantly improved. All troops, whether soldiers or officers, are full of vigor, eagerness to learn, and a spirit of progress. They said: "The socialist cause of the motherland is developing rapidly, and we must also work hard to improve our skills in order to adapt to the needs of the motherland." In 1954 alone, more than 70,000 soldiers and officers in the entire army made meritorious contributions in their studies and work, and a large number of young soldiers gloriously joined the Communist Party and the Youth League.

In order to build a better learning and living environment for themselves, the Volunteer Army comrades carried out arduous labor with their hands that had fought or been injured, and gradually improved their living conditions. We visited the Volunteer Army's barracks and construction sites and saw the neat rows of houses they had built with their own hands, with dormitories, offices, clubs, and classrooms, and many units even had auditoriums. The houses were equipped with glass windows, and fire walls or heated brick beds were installed. The rooms had sufficient furniture, and many of the new barracks were also equipped with electric lights. The forward posts with dispersed garrisons and the troops guarding the coast and islands also created their own relatively comfortable environment as much as possible. In terms of clothing, food, and other necessities, in addition to the supplies from the motherland, they also reclaimed wasteland for growing vegetables and raising pigs and chickens with the care and help of the Korean government and the Korean people. From June to October every year, most troops ensured self-sufficiency in vegetables, and some also stored a large amount of vegetables for consumption in winter and spring. In 1954 alone, the entire army produced more than 59.4 million jin of vegetables; if these vegetables were transported from the country, it would require more than 1,320 train cars. The chefs of various companies and organs often paid attention to improving the nutrition and cooking techniques of their meals. Now, many companies have two dishes and one soup for each meal, and their weight is maintained at a normal level, and many comrades have gained weight.

The Volunteer Army officers and soldiers paid even more attention to cherishing and saving the clothing and various military supplies supplied by the motherland in various seasons. They continued to maintain a simple and thrifty style in their lives. Although the logistics department regularly replenished various supplies, they preferred to use the old ones and receive fewer new ones; they used the old things until they could no longer be used. They put forward the slogan of "not wasting a grain of rice," saving more than 24 million jin of grain in 1954 alone. The transportation units under the Volunteer Army Logistics Department created various methods to save fuel, saving a large amount of fuel for the motherland. Zhou Fengrui, the leader of the electrician team of a motor vehicle repair company, created an electric welding transformer, which saved each vehicle 30 liters of gasoline per month. Over the past few years, the Volunteer Army comrades have also collected more than 3,400 tons of scrap iron and a large number of waste parts on the front lines, and manufactured or modified them into various useful equipment, greatly saving the motherland's material supplies.

The Volunteer Army officers and soldiers deeply knew that every victory in the construction cause of the Chinese and Korean peoples was a strengthening of the forces of peace. Therefore, in the past few years, they have been concerned about the socialist construction of the motherland and the restoration and construction work of the Korean people at all times, and have done everything possible to support the construction of the motherland and the Korean people.

When the news of the great victory of the socialist revolution in the motherland reached Korea, the Volunteer Army troops were as infinitely joyful and encouraged as the masses in various parts of the motherland. Many troops held grand celebrations, with soldiers wearing all the medals, badges, and commemorative badges they had won on their chests, beating gongs, drumming, and holding red flags to participate in the celebrations. They reported to each other the good news from the motherland, their achievements in learning, and their plans and resolutions for the future. Some companies specially held "hometown evenings," where they performed opera programs popular in their hometowns to celebrate the victory of the socialist revolution in their hometowns. When the Draft National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967) proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was broadcast on the radio, they braved the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius to go to the square to listen. Squad leader Wu Zhiyuan said: "Thinking of my hometown and our entire motherland, which will become so beautiful and happy in a few years, makes me so happy that I can't sleep for several nights. We can only use practical actions to better complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the people of the motherland." The officers and soldiers of the Third Company of a certain regiment first launched a donation campaign, and everyone took out the money they had saved for a long time and sent it to the agricultural production cooperatives in the motherland. Subsequently, many companies and leading organs further carried out a donation campaign to build Volunteer Army tractor stations. All the comrades of the Fourth Squad of the Third Company of a certain unit, who had made collective contributions in the war, took out 35 yuan in a few minutes; by the time the delegation returned to China, the entire army had donated more than 700,000 yuan. Some comrades who were out on duty immediately wrote letters asking to donate after hearing the news; some comrades who had originally saved some money to ask for leave to go home temporarily cancelled their plans and took out the money to build tractor stations for their farmer brothers. According to incomplete statistics, as of the beginning of February this year: the entire Volunteer Army had donated 320,000 yuan; by the time the delegation returned to China, the entire army had donated more than 700,000 yuan. Many comrades enthusiastically wrote letters to their families and relatives and friends, mobilizing them to actively produce and take the road of collectivization. The officers and soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit wrote more than 130 letters, and the relatives who were mobilized by them quickly joined the agricultural production cooperatives. Soldier Wang Yangang's father wrote back to tell him that his family, his uncle's family, and his uncle's family had all joined the cooperative, encouraging him to study hard and improve his skills. Youth League member Hu Shoufen and his lover Kang Jinhua competed with each other in their correspondence. Later, Kang Jinhua became a model, and the county gave her a certificate and elected her as the deputy director of the agricultural production cooperative; soon, Hu Shoufen also achieved a "good" or above grade in the military and political study tests and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. The Volunteer Army officers and soldiers also established correspondence contacts with labor models in factories, mines, and agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of the motherland, encouraging and competing with each other, and both sides achieved rapid progress and outstanding achievements.

After the Korean Armistice, the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers actively assisted the Korean people in carrying out restoration and construction work. They regarded the suffering of the Korean people as their own suffering and the happiness of the Korean people as their own happiness. Their slogan was: "We must help the Korean people's construction as if we were participating in the construction of the motherland." As soon as the war stopped, the Volunteer Army engineering and railway troops devoted all their efforts to restoring transportation lines, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings in the northern half of Korea. The various troops have made great achievements in helping the people in the front-line areas to restore their homes, provide disaster relief, build water conservancy projects, and help the people near the garrison areas to carry out seasonal agricultural labor. This year, the Volunteer Army leading organs decided that the entire army should use 600,000 workdays to systematically help the Korean people carry out urban construction, agricultural production, water conservancy construction, afforestation, and so on. The Pyeongnam Irrigation System project, which was built jointly by the Volunteer Army and the Korean people in March, completed more than 114,000 workdays and excavated more than 274,000 cubic meters of soil. In order to complete the project before the spring ploughing, they insisted on working in heavy snow and rain, and some troops even carried out night operations. In the Seung-ho-ri area of ​​South Pyongan Province, a certain unit of the Volunteer Army participated in the construction of a modern water diversion and irrigation project. The task undertaken was to complete the reinforced concrete project of the "throat" part of the project and excavate and repair a 20-kilometer-long straight trunk line, which has been completed on April 21. In the Gokshan area, the Volunteer Army helped the Korean people build nine canals, three dams, and two reservoirs. After completing the Samsung-ri canal, the troops stationed on the west coast are helping the local people build the sea dike in the Gomiyang area. In daily actions, the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers strictly abide by all the policies and laws of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, care for the interests of the Korean people everywhere, and cherish every plant and tree in Korea. Whenever there is an important Korean festival, the Volunteer Army troops send representatives to the party and government organs above the county level in the garrison area and the nearby People's Army troops to congratulate them; for important Volunteer Army gatherings, representatives from the local Korean party, government, military, and civilians are also invited to participate. Through these activities, the deep friendship forged by the Volunteer Army and the Korean military and civilians with blood in the war has been further developed after the war.

IV

In the days after the war, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army have continued to make significant contributions in the struggle to maintain peace and have continued to give our people tremendous encouragement and support. Their spirit of not fearing difficulties, forging ahead, and working hard in the restoration and construction work, as well as their brilliant achievements, are deeply admirable. We must learn from the Korean people's selfless spirit of labor and accelerate our country's socialist construction. Our people will continue to consolidate and develop the profound brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, and we must continue to join hands with peace-loving people all over the world to fully support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the country, so that the Korean issue can be completely resolved.

During our stay in Korea, we deeply felt that every progress in the socialist cause of the motherland is inseparable from the efforts of the soldiers who defend the motherland and defend peace, and is inseparable from the efforts of the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers in Korea. In recent years, although their material and cultural living conditions have been continuously improved, there are still certain difficulties in various aspects due to being far away from the motherland. We should continue to give them care and support. The difficulties of the families of revolutionary soldiers must be given practical care, and the preferential treatment and resettlement of the wounded, sick, disabled, and demobilized personnel should be done carefully; the people of various places should often correspond with the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers to encourage each other. Finally, we must use practical actions and our great construction achievements in our respective positions to respond to our most beloved people.

    中国人民赴朝慰问团在朝鲜
    中国人民赴朝慰问团总团长　王子宜
    一
    1956年2月趁着春节和朝鲜人民军“二八”建军节之际，我国人民又一次组织了赴朝慰问团，前往朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，慰问为维护朝鲜停战、争取朝鲜问题的和平解决和保护远东和世界和平而日夜辛劳的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。慰问团包括：政府、工会、妇联、青年团、工商联、文联及中国人民解放军的代表；有工业、农业劳动模范，先进工作者，青年社会主义建设积极分子，资本主义工商业社会主义改造积极分子，以及革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和复员军人模范；还有戏曲、歌舞、杂技、曲艺等十三个文艺团体。
    我们从二月初开始分别在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军各部队展开慰问活动，到四月底止，全部工作才告结束。在这期间，我们参加了在平壤市和开城市举行的朝鲜人民军“二八”建军节的庆祝活动。接着向朝鲜人民军师团以上的领导机关和人民军部队及部队驻地的朝鲜人民进行了慰问和演出。春节期间，慰问团同志分别在志愿军各部队同志愿军官兵欢度了佳节。慰问团到过上甘岭、鹰峰、高城、丁字山等阵地，慰问了坚守在第一线的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军官兵；慰问团还对后方部队、后勤部队和运输部队进行了慰问。在部队集中的地方举行了报告大会和演出；在分散的阵地、工地、医院、伙房以及志愿军列车上，也作了慰问和小型节目的演出；有的还通过电话、广播对驻守海岛的部队进行慰问。在这期间，我们向各地的人民军和志愿军烈士陵园、平壤市解放纪念塔以及国际主义战士朴在根、罗盛教等烈士的陵墓进行了扫祭，也重点访问了朝鲜的烈士家属和拥军模范。通过慰问会、报告会、座谈会和慰问演出等活动，传达了我国人民对朝鲜人民军、朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的深情厚意。全国人民交给我们的光荣的慰问任务，可以说是胜利地完成了。
    慰问团两个多月来的活动，更加增进了中朝人民间的亲密友谊，也鼓舞了中国人民志愿军官兵的斗争意志。同我们会过面的广大朝鲜人民军官兵和朝鲜人民，都亲切地托咐我们向我国人民转达他们真挚的友情和兄弟般的关心；志愿军官兵在听到代表们报告祖国社会主义革命高潮的具体情况和全国人民对他们的关怀后，都纷纷向慰问团的同志表达自己保卫祖国和争取和平解决朝鲜问题的坚强决心。慰问团收到了朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军官兵们和朝鲜人民写的上万封信件和大批的礼品、纪念品，充分地表达了他们对全中国人民无比热爱的心情。
    二
    我们在朝鲜慰问和访问期间，对于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜军民几年来维护和平、争取祖国统一和恢复发展北半部国民经济的努力和成就，感到无限的敬佩。
    停战以来，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、朝鲜人民和人民军一贯忠实地执行着停战协定的一切条款，并且积极地提出了巩固朝鲜和平、实现国家统一的各项合理的主张。但是美国侵略集团和李承晚拒绝一切和平建议，他们还在积极地进行扩军备战，制造紧张局势，企图对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动突然袭击。此外，他们还百般阻挠、限制和破坏中立国监察委员会的工作。这样，使朝鲜的和平受到严重的威胁。
    在这种情况下，为了保卫朝、中两国和平建设的安全，朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军亲密地团结在一起，坚守着自己的战斗岗位，继续警惕地注视着敌人的阴谋活动，并采取一切措施制止敌人的挑衅。我们在各个前沿阵地上慰问和访问中，看到了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军如何艰苦守卫着阵地的情形。我们在朝鲜期间，正遇着几场大雪，气候严寒，前哨阵地的山头上在零下30多度。但是他们个个精神饱满，意志坚强，从没有丝毫放松对敌人的警戒；他们冒着大风大雪，日夜站岗放哨，沿线巡逻，严密监视着敌人的活动；守卫在海岸和海岛的部队，更以坚强的毅力战胜种种困难，完成警卫任务。由于他们几年来共同努力，可靠地保障了军事分界线的稳定和保卫着中朝两国的和平建设。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民，在“一切为了加强民主基地”的口号下，以自己的劳动和智慧，医治了战争创伤，并且使国民经济迅速地向前发展。停战几年来，恢复建设工作取得了伟大的成就，战争中曾经遭受严重破坏的城镇和乡村，都以惊人的速度重新建设起来了。在工业方面，停战后短短两年当中，就把战时遭受破坏的230多个发电厂、矿山、钢铁冶炼厂、机械制造厂、化学工厂等全部恢复起来了，并有六十多个具有先进技术设备的新建工业企业投入了生产。国营和合作社营工业生产总值比1953年上半年增长到2.5倍。在农业方面，恢复了因战争破坏和荒废的广大农田，增加了约四万公顷的灌溉面积，农业机器代耕站在1955年上半年比1953年上半年增加到2.6倍。参加农业生产合作社的农民已经超过44％。在交通运输方面，战后两年间恢复和新建铁路749公里，货运量在1955年上半年比1953年上半年增加了84％，公路货运量增加到4.7倍。随着生产的迅速发展，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在停战后曾四次降低物价，使职工人员的实际工资增加了两倍以上。农民的生活也大为改善了。我们曾经访问了平壤市附近的万景台农业生产合作社和平康地区的张耀义农业生产合作社，入社农户家家都有余粮，生活一天比一天美好起来了。朝鲜人民在恢复建设过程中，涌现出了无数的先进生产者和先进工作者，许多人获得了国家颁发的勋章和奖章。我们在各地访问中，到处都可以看到蓬勃建设的景象和热情劳动着的朝鲜人民。
    朝鲜人民在和平建设的同时，亲切地关怀和积极地支援着中国人民志愿军。从停战到1955年，据不完全的统计，朝鲜各级党政机关和人民团体，在节日和平时，派出代表团、艺术团、电影队深入志愿军部队和工地慰问共达一千八百多次，演出文艺节目及放映电影五千二百多次，并且送去十三万多封的慰问信，和慰问品二十九万四千件，各种食品七十二万六千多斤，蔬菜十三万四千多斤。在修建艾山江、安戎江水堤时，五百多名妇女从五、六里外打井水给志愿军部队烧开水喝，二百多名文艺工作者到各工地慰问演出。停战以来，朝鲜政府继续授予了志愿军有功人员以各种勋章、奖章，朝鲜各地人民为志愿军烈士们选择了适当的地方，修建了烈士陵园。朝鲜政府和人民对志愿军帮助建成的各项工程，命名为“中朝亲善坝”“战斗友谊桥”“十四勇士渠”等。在我们访问朝鲜人民的过程中，朝鲜的父母们都让我们转告志愿军官兵的家人说：“你们在朝鲜的子弟有我们的照顾，请你们放心”。
    三
    我们在志愿军各部队生活的这些日子里，亲切地体会到志愿军全体官兵为祖国、为和平事业忠诚服务的崇高品质和伟大精神，使我们受到深深的感动。
    朝鲜停战以来，志愿军除了同朝鲜人民军一起严守着阵地外，他们在学习中、在支援祖国建设和帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设当中，如同往日一样，高度地发挥了国际主义和爱国主义的伟大精神和革命英雄主义气概。
    为了更好地担负起捍卫和平的任务，全体官兵展开了紧张的学习，经过两年多的努力，他们的军事素养、政治觉悟和文化水平都有了显著的提高，所有部队，无论士兵或军官，都充满着朝气蓬勃、好学上进的精神。他们说：“祖国的社会主义事业在一日千里地发展，我们也必须努力提高本领，才能适应祖国的需要。”仅1954年间，全军就有七万多名士兵和军官，在学习和工作中立了功，大批的青年军人光荣地入了共产党、入了青年团。
    为了给自己建设一个较好的学习和生活环境，志愿军同志们用自己作过战或负过伤的双手进行了艰巨的劳动，逐步地改善了他们的居住条件。我们参观了志愿军的营房和营建工地，看到他们亲手盖起的一幢幢整齐的房屋，有宿舍、办公室，有俱乐部和课堂，不少部队还有礼堂。房子安上了玻璃窗户，设置了火墙或火炕，室内有足够的家具，很多部队的新营房里还安上了电灯。驻地分散的前哨阵地和驻守海岸、海岛的部队，也尽可能地创设起自己较为舒适的环境。在衣、食及其他必需品方面，除由祖国供应的以外，他们在朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民的关怀和帮助下，还自己开荒种菜、养猪养鸡。每年从六月到十月这五个月里，大多数部队都保证了蔬菜自给，有的还贮藏了大量蔬菜供冬、春两季食用。仅在1954年全军就生产了蔬菜5，940多万斤；这些菜，如果从国内运输，需要1，320多个车皮。各连队和机关的炊事员同志，经常注意改进饮食的营养和烹调技术，现在许多连队每顿饭都有两菜一汤，他们的体重都保持正常，且有不少同志体重增加。
    志愿军官兵们对祖国供应的各季被服和各种军需物资更是注意爱护和节约，他们在生活上继续保持着朴素节俭的作风，尽管后勤部门定期补充各种用品，但是他们宁愿用旧的，少领新的；把旧的东西用到不能再用的时候为止。他们提出了“不浪费一粒米”的口号，仅1954年一年就节约了二千四百多万斤粮食。志愿军后勤部所属运输部队，创造了节省油料的各种办法，为祖国节约了大量的油料。某部汽车修理连电工组长周凤瑞同志创造的电焊变压器，使每车每月可节省汽油三十公升。几年来志愿军同志们还在前沿阵地上搜集了三千四百多吨废铁和大批废件，把它们制造或改装成各种有用的器材，大大地节省了祖国的物资供应。
    志愿军官兵们深深知道，中朝两国人民建设事业的每一胜利，都是和平力量的增强。因此，几年来，他们无时无刻不在关怀祖国的社会主义建设和朝鲜人民的恢复建设工作，并且尽一切可能来支援祖国和朝鲜人民的建设。
    当祖国社会主义革命取得伟大胜利的消息传到朝鲜的时候，志愿军各部队也正像祖国各地群众一样无限地欢欣鼓舞。许多部队都举行了盛大的庆祝会，战士们把自己获得的勋章、奖章和纪念章全部挂在胸前，敲着锣，打着鼓，举着红旗，前来参加庆祝会。他们互相报告来自祖国的喜讯，报告自己在学习中的成绩和今后的计划和决心。有的连队特地举行了“家乡晚会”，在会上表演自己家乡流行的戏曲节目，庆祝自己家乡社会主义革命事业取得的胜利。中共中央提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）在广播中播送的时候，他们冒着零下二十度的严寒，跑到广场去听。班长伍之元说：“想起我的家乡和我们整个祖国，几年以后就要变得那么美好和幸福，使我高兴得几个晚上都睡不着。我们只有用实际行动来更好地完成祖国人民交给的光荣任务。”某团三连的官兵们，首先发起了捐献运动，各人都把自己长久节省下的钱拿出来，寄给祖国的农业生产合作社。接着，许多连队和领导机关进一步开展了筹建志愿军拖拉机站的捐献运动。在战争中立过集体功的某部三连四班的全体同志，在几分钟内就拿出了三十五元；到慰问团回国的时候，全军捐款达到了七十多万元。有的同志外出执勤，听到消息后，都马上写信回来要求捐献；有的同志原先积蓄了一些钱准备请假回家，都临时取消了自己的计划，把钱拿出来为农民兄弟筹建拖拉机站。到今年二月初为止，根据不完全统计：志愿军全军捐款已达三十二万元；到慰问团回国的时候，全军捐款达到了七十多万元。许多同志热烈地写信给自己的家属和亲友。动员他们积极生产，走合作化道路。某部三连官兵们写了一百三十多封信，经过他们动员的亲属，都很快地参加了农业生产合作社。战士王延刚的父亲回信告诉他：他们家、叔伯和舅舅家都加入了合作社，鼓励他好好学习，提高本领。青年团员胡寿芬和他的爱人康金花在通信中互相提出比赛，后来康金花当了模范，县里给了她奖状，群众选举她当了农业生产合作社的副社长；不久，胡寿芬在军事、政治学习测验中也获得了“良好”以上的成绩，并且光荣地加入了中国共产党。志愿军官兵们还同祖国各地的工厂、矿山、农业生产合作社的劳动模范们建立了通信联系，互相鼓励，互相竞赛，双方都获得了迅速的进步和突出的成绩。
    朝鲜停战以后，志愿军官兵们积极地协助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设工作。他们以朝鲜人民的患难为自己的患难，以朝鲜人民的幸福为自己的幸福。他们的口号是：“要像参加祖国的建设一样来帮助朝鲜人民的建设”。志愿军工兵和铁道兵部队战争一停止，就全力投入了恢复朝鲜北半部的交通线、学校、医院和住宅等工作。各部队在帮助前沿地区人民恢复家园、救济灾民、修建水利工程和帮助驻区附近人民进行季节性的农业劳动中，都取得了极大的成绩。今年，志愿军领导机关决定全军要以六十万个劳动日，有计划地帮助朝鲜人民进行城市建设、农业生产、兴修水利、植树造林等等。志愿军在三月间同朝鲜人民一起修建的平南灌溉系统工程，共做了十一万四千多个工，挖土二十七万四千多立方公尺，为了赶在春耕前完工，他们曾在大雪天和雨天坚持上工，有的部队还进行了夜间作业。在平安南道胜湖里地区，志愿军某部参加了一项近代化的引水灌溉工程的建设，所担负的任务是完成这个工程“咽喉”部分的钢筋水泥工程和挖修二十公里长的直干线，已经在四月二十一日完成。在谷山地区，志愿军帮助朝鲜人民建成了九条水渠、三个水坝和两个水库。驻守西海岸的部队在完成三星里水渠以后，正在帮助当地人民修筑高美阳地区的海堤。在日常行动中，志愿军官兵们严格遵守着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的一切政策法令，处处关怀朝鲜人民的利益，爱护朝鲜的一草一木。每逢朝鲜的重要节日，志愿军部队都派代表到驻地郡以上党、政机关和附近的人民军部队祝贺；志愿军的重要集会，也请当地的朝鲜党、政、军、民派代表参加。通过这些活动，使志愿军同朝鲜军民在战争中以鲜血结成的深厚友谊，在战后又有了进一步的发展。

    朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在战后的日子里，在维护和平的斗争中继续作出了重大的贡献，继续给予了我国人民以莫大的鼓舞和支援。他们在恢复和建设工作中不怕困难、勇往直前和艰苦劳动的精神以及他们的光辉成就，令人深深地敬佩。我们要学习朝鲜人民忘我的劳动精神，加速我国的社会主义建设。我国人民将继续巩固和发展中朝人民间的兄弟般的深厚友谊，并且一定要继续同世界爱好和平的人民一道，全力支持朝鲜人民争取国家和平统一的斗争，使朝鲜问题得到彻底的解决。
    我们在朝鲜期间，更深切地感到：祖国社会主义事业的每一进展，是同保卫祖国、保卫和平的战士们的努力分不开的，是同志愿军官兵们在朝鲜的努力分不开的。近几年来，他们的物质、文化生活条件虽有不断的改善，但是由于远离祖国，各方面仍然有一定的困难，我们应当继续给予他们以关怀和支援。对革命军人家属的困难，必须予以切实照顾，对伤、病、残废和复员的人员应当认真做好优抚和安置工作；各地人民应当经常和志愿军官兵们互相通信，互相鼓励。最后，我们在各个岗位上要用实际行动，用我们伟大的建设成就来回答我们最可爱的人。
