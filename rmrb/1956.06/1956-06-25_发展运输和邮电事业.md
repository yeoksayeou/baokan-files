    Developing Transportation and Postal and Telecommunications Services
    -- Speech by Wang Shoudao, Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council
    I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget. Now I would like to express some opinions on transportation and postal and telecommunications work.
    The transportation tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan will be greatly overfulfilled.
    Transportation work overfulfilled the planned tasks in 1955. The freight turnover volume completed 102.5% of the plan by railway, 100% of the plan by waterway, and 104% of the plan by automobile transportation. Compared with the planned level for 1957, the final year of the Five-Year Plan: railways have reached 80.6%, waterways have reached 68.6%, and automobile transportation has reached 77%. Civil aviation passenger traffic completed 114% of the plan in 1955, reaching 89.3% of the 1957 planned level; at the same time, professional flights have also developed. In the first half of 1956, freight volume increased rapidly, and various ministries (bureaus) have overfulfilled the original transportation plans in the past five months. Judging from the completion of the above transportation tasks, the transportation tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan can not only be successfully completed, but also greatly overfulfilled. In the past year and a half, the transportation departments have done a lot of work in order to provide good transportation conditions for the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of commodity circulation. In order to improve the utilization efficiency of transportation equipment, the railway has vigorously organized direct transportation and the work of pulling fast, overloaded trains. In terms of waterway transportation, the experience of "advanced voyages" and the transportation method of "changing tugboats without changing barges" for zonal towing were promoted, and joint river-sea transportation was organized. This accelerated the turnover of vehicles and ships and increased the load capacity. In 1955, the number of direct transport wagons on railways accounted for 19.8% of the total number of freight wagons, and the turnover time of freight wagons was shortened by nearly one hour compared with the plan; the average traction tonnage of freight trains reached 1,385 tons, an increase of 2.4% over the annual plan, and by May this year, it continued to increase to 1,528 tons. The coordination and cooperation between railway and industrial transportation, port and terminal transportation has also begun to improve. Since the second half of last year, various departments of railways, waterways, highways, and civil aviation have seen a new upsurge in socialist labor competitions, which has played a decisive role in improving labor productivity, saving fuel and materials, and reducing transportation costs; significant achievements have been made in fuel conservation. The fuel consumption quota for ocean-going ships decreased by an average of about 2% last year; railway locomotives saved more than 84,000 tons of coal compared with the annual plan. The work of serving passengers has also improved since the end of last year. This summer, the railway added 52 pairs of passenger trains, appropriately reduced suburban ticket prices, group ticket prices, and student vacation ticket prices; in terms of sea transportation, passenger liners between Shanghai and Dalian were added. The service attitude of passenger transport personnel has also improved. In the past, there were constant incidents of long-distance "consignment of children," but now there have been incidents of safely sending a ten-year-old girl from Andong Station to Huiyang, Guangdong, via train and bus joint transportation.
    Shortcomings in Transportation Work
    However, it must be pointed out that there are still many serious shortcomings in transportation work. During the transportation process, phenomena such as shortage of goods, spoilage, damage, loss, errors, etc., still occur constantly. In 1955, the waterway transport department alone had already compensated 184,000 yuan; in the transport of Sichuan grain, the loss rate from January to July was as high as 6.5%. In addition, marine accidents are also very serious. The organization of transportation work cannot keep up with the needs of increasing traffic volume, which has become more prominent this year. The main technical indicators of the railway have declined, the operating order is chaotic, and phenomena such as station congestion, inability to transport goods, and inability to unload goods occur constantly; the punctuality rate of freight trains in May only reached 78%. Our transportation workers are not doing enough in how to improve their work and better serve production and passengers. For example, the railway closed more than 200 stations last year, some of which were inappropriate; insufficient attention was paid to less-than-carload freight trains, and the organization was improper, resulting in backlog of goods. Some stations even dried out the sweet potato seedlings consigned by farmers; overcrowding and filth on trains, ships, and automobiles are still quite common, and passengers have difficulty buying tickets; the food in dining cars is expensive and of poor quality; and the rude service attitude of a few staff members, etc., often make it difficult for consignment departments and passengers.
    Strengthen Transportation Organization Work and Simplify Consignment Procedures
    Ensuring the timely and complete transportation of goods and the safe, convenient, and comfortable travel of the people is the basic task of the transportation department. We must overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings and improve the quality of transportation work. We should continue to strengthen transportation organization work, conscientiously implement the railway transportation daily and shift plans, rectify the operating order, vigorously promote advanced production experiences such as locomotives producing one million ton-kilometers per day, advanced ship voyages, and safe, economical, and major overhaul-free 100,000 kilometers for automobiles, and accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships. Simplify consignment procedures, ensure the timely and complete transportation of goods, promote container transportation of scattered goods and rapid transportation of fresh and live goods in railway transportation. Strengthen cooperation between railway and port terminals, special railway lines of industrial and mining enterprises, and promote the experience of unified transportation technology operations between railway and Dalian Port and Anshan Iron and Steel. Continue to rectify passenger transport work, implement a ticket sales system that is convenient for passengers, maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of stations, ports, vehicles, and ships, and improve the supply of food and beverages to passengers. However, in improving transportation work, we must be realistic and proceed from the overall interests of the country. We cannot abandon the effective 5-day plan system and the organization of less-than-carload freight in order to abolish "unnecessary rules and regulations," and form a "load as you go" situation; this will weaken the planning of transportation work, disrupt transportation order, and prolong transportation time.
    Improve the Planning of Transportation and Use Transportation Tools Rationally
    Speaking of the planning of transportation, it has been gradually improved in recent years. The accuracy of the railway freight consignment plan in 1955 reached 91.5%, while it was only 85.4% in 1954. The balance of transportation has also improved. In order to economically and rationally utilize transportation capacity, some material departments, such as the Ministry of Grain and the Ministry of Coal Industry, have made great efforts. The transportation of coal and grain has implemented a zonal production and sales balance rational transportation system; coal, wood, and cement have implemented a unified delivery system. Several railway stations in the Northeast, Dalian Port, and Shanghai Port have implemented grain water-land combined transportation. However, our planning work is not yet completely based on reliable foundations. The investigation data on freight sources and freight flows lack reliable basis for production, transportation, and sales balance, and there are still phenomena of overestimation and underestimation of annual transportation volume in the annual transport plans. During the implementation of the plan, there was also a phenomenon of "overly strict and rigid." The railway criticized this at the end of last year, but then there was a phenomenon of "overly loose and lenient." After the railway cancelled the due unplanned fines in February this year, unplanned transportation increased from about 9% to about 13%, and the planning of transportation was reduced accordingly. Unreasonable phenomena in cargo transportation, such as duplication, counter-current, over-distance, and roundabout transportation are also very serious, accounting for 7.2% of the total transport volume on the railway in 1955. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen transportation planning work and economically and rationally use various transportation tools. It is recommended that the central major material departments, while formulating production and sales plans, formulate transportation plans based on the flow and reasonable direction of materials, and establish and improve transportation planning agencies. Continue to promote the regional production and sales balance rational transportation system and the unified delivery system for major materials. Each province and autonomous region should also promote these two systems in their respective regions, starting with major materials, and constantly summarize experience and promote them. Each transportation department should also conscientiously prevent and supervise the occurrence of unreasonable transportation. Vigorously promote water-land combined transportation. The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications should formulate a division of labor plan for railway, waterway, and highway transportation, and prepare water-land combined transportation plans on a monthly or quarterly basis. Reduce the cost and freight rates of waterway and highway transportation in order to increase the proportion of waterway transportation and make full use of automobiles for short-distance transportation as much as possible.
    Progress in Transportation and Postal and Telecommunications Infrastructure Work
    In terms of infrastructure work for transportation and postal and telecommunications, great progress has also been made in the past year and a half. As of the end of May this year, the total mileage of railways opened to traffic nationwide has reached approximately 27,362 kilometers; a total of 3,071 kilometers of new lines were built in the past three years and five months, completing 75% of the Five-Year Plan. The Jining-Erlian, Fengtai-Shacheng, Litang-Zhanjiang, and Lancun-Yantai railways were opened to traffic last year; this year, the Jinchengjiang-Mawei section of the Qian-Gui Railway has been repaired and opened to traffic, and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will be connected in early July. At the same time, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway can be laid to Yumen, and the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway can also be completed by the end of this year. The Baotou-Lanzhou and Neijiang-Kunming railways have started construction simultaneously at both the north and south ends; the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has begun preparations for beam erection, and will be completed a year ahead of schedule next year. From 1953 to the end of April this year, a total of 37,310 kilometers of highways (including simple highways) were built. The total mileage of highways open to traffic nationwide reached 183,000 kilometers by the end of April this year. The deadweight tonnage of ships increased by 95,706 tons in 1955, completing 60.9% of the Five-Year Plan task as of the end of May this year. The first phase of the Zhanjiang Seaport, designed and constructed by our country itself, is about to be completed. Civil aviation has opened international routes to Vietnam, Myanmar, etc. This year, air traffic to Tibet has been successfully opened in domestic routes. As of the end of May, the total mileage of civil aviation routes has reached 17,194 kilometers. Postal and telecommunications infrastructure investment completed 95% of the plan in 1955. As of the end of 1955, the total length of long-distance telecommunications lines nationwide has reached more than 140,000 pole kilometers, completing 96.5% of the Five-Year Plan task; the number of self-operated post and telecommunications bureaus and offices has reached 17,609 as of the end of May this year; international postal and telecommunications relations have been established with forty-three countries. It is expected that the infrastructure tasks of transportation and postal and telecommunications stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. In the past year, the various departments of transportation and postal and telecommunications infrastructure have made many achievements in completing their tasks "more, faster, better, and more economically." They have improved design work, strengthened construction management, and adopted advanced technologies, such as the world's pioneering large-scale pipe column drilling method in bridge foundation engineering, large blasting in earthwork engineering, etc., so that the Yangtze River Bridge, Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, and Baoji-Chengdu Railway can be completed one or two years ahead of schedule. Engineering costs have also been reduced. Taking the railway as an example, after taking measures to reduce costs in the second half of last year, the average cost of new lines was reduced by 120,000 yuan per kilometer. However, the shortcomings are still serious. There is still a tendency to rush work and ignore quality in construction guidance. In addition, the hydrological and geological data are insufficient, and there is great blindness in route selection and alignment. Failures to correct problems in a timely manner during construction often leads to poor engineering quality. For example, serious landslides and tunnels that don't meet standard clearances have been found on the Baoji-Chengdu line. In the Guangyuan-Lueyang section, which is only 140 kilometers long, there are more than 500 large and small landslides; some railways lack the necessary transportation equipment after they are built, affecting timely delivery for operation. The casualties in highway, seaport, and railway engineering construction are also serious. The transportation and postal and telecommunications departments do not pay enough attention to the technical transformation of existing technical equipment. In the railway sector, the investment plan for technical transformation in 1955 was not completed. This year, due to the growth in transport volume, the burden on the original busy transport sections has become heavier and heavier, creating a state of tension. The construction of buildings related to the life and welfare of employees has been insufficient for several years, especially the lack of employee housing. Some employees have been separated from their spouses for several years, and some have been unable to marry as a result. Therefore, we must improve the quality of the project, strengthen design work, simplify design procedures, improve the overall design quality, and vigorously promote standardized design to reverse the situation in which design cannot keep up with construction due to increased tasks; strengthen geological and hydrological investigation and research; improve the level of construction technology, strictly observe operating discipline; strengthen safety education for employees, improve labor protection equipment, and eliminate major industrial accidents. Strengthen the technical transformation of existing equipment. We should continue to reduce project costs, strengthen construction organization, and reduce downtime and waste. Gradually build employee dormitories and necessary welfare facilities to improve the living conditions of employees. In short, all infrastructure work must consider objective needs to pursue more and faster, and at the same time put more and faster on an active and reliable basis, and pursue more and faster on the premise of good, economical, and safe. Any isolated and one-sided emphasis on that aspect will bring losses to the country and the people.
    Problems in the Development of Local Transportation Work
    Local transportation work in our country also made great progress in 1955. Especially after the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization came last year, the enthusiasm of the masses for road construction was even higher, forming a nationwide road construction upsurge in the first quarter of this year. However, because our country has a vast area and there are very few original roads, the transportation department has lacked due attention and comprehensive planning for local transportation construction in the past few years, so the development has been very slow and cannot meet the needs of rural transportation; after the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program, there was a tendency to be impatient. Some regions attempted to complete the work planned to be completed in 7 or 12 years in three or five years or even a shorter period, so they failed to closely integrate with production needs, excessively occupied land, and caused phenomena of wasting manpower and delaying agricultural production. The quality of the roads built in some areas is also not good. The socialist transformation of private shipping, automobiles, and individual transportation industries is basically healthy, but there are also shortcomings such as low property valuation during joint ventures, neglecting the arrangement of non-substantive personnel, prematurely pursuing advanced forms in the cooperativization movement of individual transportation industries, excessive public accumulation funds and non-production expenditures, and reduced income of cooperative members. Therefore, in the future, in local transportation construction, we must move forward steadily, and we must oppose both right-leaning conservatism and foot-dragging, and oppose blind adventurism, greed for more and faster.
    Achieve Smooth Postal and Telecommunications between Urban and Rural Areas
    The postal and telecommunications industry has also developed. The total business volume increased by 13% compared with 1954, and the total postal and telecommunications business revenue in 1955 completed 103.4% of the plan, reaching 92.5% of the 1957 planned level. It is expected that the postal and telecommunications business volume in the First Five-Year Plan may also be overfulfilled. In the past year or so, we have added postal and telecommunications service agencies and expanded the service coverage. Improved communication quality. Rectified the organizational structure, implemented quota management for administrative personnel, and established and implemented some systems to improve enterprise management.
    In order to fully meet the needs of the rapid development of our national economy, and to change the backward situation of our country's transportation and postal and telecommunications technology and equipment, small quantity, and unbalanced distribution, we must not be satisfied with these existing achievements, and we must also guard against arrogance and rashness; in the next two or three five-year plans, we will strive to build a modern transportation network with railways as the backbone, connected by railways, waterways, highways, and civil aviation, and a modern postal and telecommunications communication network. That is to say, we must greatly develop railways and local roads in the northwest, southwest, and border areas; increase the mileage of navigable waterways and open up canals; link our country's inland and border areas, cities and villages into a whole; adopt various advanced technologies and gradually realize railway electrification and automation; in the postal and telecommunications industry, we must lay a large number of long-distance cables, install multi-channel carrier machines, increase the capacity of urban automatic telephones, and gradually popularize rural postal services, county telephones, and wired broadcasting to achieve smooth postal and telecommunications between urban and rural areas.
    Implement the Division of Labor Management between the Central and Local Governments according to the Nature of the Undertakings and Enterprises and Their Different Roles in the National Economy
    Due to the increasing development of transportation and postal and telecommunications services, we must rely on people's committees at all levels and the leading institutions of enterprises at all levels to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of employees and jointly manage transportation and postal and telecommunications work well. Therefore, we should implement the division of labor management between the central and local governments according to the nature of the undertakings and enterprises and their different roles in the national economy. All undertakings and enterprises with greater local characteristics should be managed by the local governments in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the local governments. The undertakings and enterprises directly managed by the central government should also implement dual leadership and strengthen the supervision and inspection of them by local party committees and governments. The division of powers between the ministry and its subordinate enterprise institutions should be clarified. Major and minor matters should not be concentrated in the ministry, so that the ministry's leadership is busy with affairs and becomes passive, and the enthusiasm of its subordinate enterprises cannot be brought into play. A certain degree of autonomy must be given to subordinate undertakings and enterprises in terms of planning, finance, personnel, and management; so that the leading organs can free up their hands to strengthen research and guidance on principles and policies, formulate important rules and regulations, grasp the balance of planning and finance, unify technical standards, strengthen inspection and supervision work, and timely help subordinate undertakings and enterprises solve major problems and overcome shortcomings and errors in their work; only in this way can the ministry strengthen the specific leadership of subordinate undertakings and enterprises. We should also fully promote democracy, listen to the opinions of employees, care about their lives; value the rationalization proposals and inventions of employees, and continue to carry out the advanced producer movement. I believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, we will be able to overcome any difficulties and shortcomings in our work and continue to advance victoriously in the socialist construction cause of our great motherland.

    发展运输和邮电事业
    ——国务院第六办公室主任王首道的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告。现在我就运输和邮电工作发表一些意见。
    第一个五年计划所规定的运输任务将大大超额完成
    运输工作在1955年超额完成了计划任务，货运周转量铁路完成计划的102.5％，水运完成计划的100％，汽车运输完成计划的104％。如果与五年计划最后一年1957年的计划水平来比较：铁路已达80.6％，水运已达68.6％，汽车运输已达77％。民用航空客运量1955年完成计划114％，已达1957年计划水平的89.3％；同时专业飞行也有了发展。1956年上半年，货运量增长很快，近五个月来各部（局）也都超额完成了原定运输计划。从以上运输任务完成的情况来看，第一个五年计划所规定的运输任务不仅能顺利完成，并将大大超额完成。近一年半来，运输部门为了对发展工、农业生产和扩大商品流转提供良好的运输条件，曾经作了许多工作。为了提高运输设备的运用效率，铁路上大力组织了直达运输和牵引快速超轴列车的工作，水运方面推行了“先进航次”的经验，和“换拖轮不换驳船”分区牵引的运输方式，并组织了江海联运。这样就加速了车辆和船舶的周转，增加了载重量。铁路1955年直达运输装车数已占货物装车总数的19.8％，货车周转时间较计划缩短了将近一个小时；货物列车平均牵引吨数达到1，385吨，比年计划提高2.4％，到今年5月，又继续提高到1，528吨。铁路与工业运输，港口码头运输之间的配合协作，也开始有了好转。铁路、水路、公路、民航各部门，自去年下半年以来，社会主义劳动竞赛有了新的高涨，对于提高劳动生产率，节约燃料、材料，降低运输成本，起了决定性的作用；燃料的节约有了显著成绩，海船的燃料消耗定额，去年平均降低了2％左右；铁路机车用煤较年计划节约了84，000余吨。为旅客服务的工作，自去年底以来，也有了改进。铁路方面今年夏季增加了52对旅客列车，适当降低了近郊票价、团体票价和学生寒暑假回家票价；海运方面增开了上海大连间的旅客班轮。客运人员的服务态度也有了改进，过去曾不断出现过长途“托运儿童”的事迹，现在又出现了从安东车站经过火车、汽车的联运把十周岁的小女孩安全送到广东惠阳的事迹。
    运输工作中的缺点
    但是必须指出，在运输工作中也还存在着许多较严重的缺点。在运输过程中，货物短少份量、污损、毁坏、丢失、差错等现象还不断发生，1955年仅水运部门已经赔偿的款额即达184，000元；在川粮运输中，1至7月份耗损率竟达6.5％。此外，海损事故也很严重。运输组织工作跟不上运量上涨的需要，今年以来更为突出，铁路的主要技术指标下降、运行秩序混乱，不断发生车站堵塞、货物运不走卸不下来的现象；5月份货物列车运行正点比例只达到78％。我们的运输工作人员，在如何改进工作，更好地为生产、为旅客服务这方面，也还做得不够。譬如去年铁路曾封闭了200多个车站，有些是不恰当的；对零担货物列车重视不够，组织不当，造成货物积压，有的车站把农民托运的地瓜秧子也晒干了；火车、轮船、汽车上拥挤和肮脏的现象还相当普遍，旅客买票困难；餐车的饭食价钱高、质量低；以及少数工作人员的服务态度生硬等等，常使托运部门和旅客感到困难。
    加强运输组织工作简化托运手续
    保证货物运输的及时、完整，人民旅行的安全、便利和舒适，是运输部门的基本任务。我们必须克服上述的缺点，提高运输工作的质量，应该继续加强运输组织工作，认真执行铁路运输日、班计划，整顿运行秩序，大力推广机车日产百万吨公里、船舶先进航次和汽车安全、节约、十万公里无大修等等先进生产经验，加速车辆、船舶的周转。简化托运手续，保证货物的及时运送和完整无损，推广铁路运输中将零星货物集中装箱的集装箱运输和鲜货、活货的快速运输。加强铁路与港湾码头、工矿企业专用线运输间的协作，推广铁路与大连港、与鞍钢实行统一运输技术作业过程的经验。继续整顿客运工作，实行便利旅客的售票制度，保持车站、港口和车辆、船舶的清洁卫生，改善对旅客饮食的供应工作。但是，在改进运输工作中，必须实事求是，从国家的整体利益出发，不能为了废除“清规戒律”，就放弃了行之有效的5日计划制度和对零担货物的组织工作，而形成“随到随装”；这样反而减弱运输工作的计划性，打乱运输秩序，延长运送时间。
    提高运输的计划性合理使用运输工具
    提到运输计划性，几年来是逐步提高的。1955年铁路货物托运计划的准确性达到91.5％，而1954年只有85.4％。运输的均衡性也有提高。为了经济合理地利用运输力，有的物资部门如粮食部、煤炭工业部等作了很大努力，煤炭、粮食运输已实行了分区产销平衡合理运输制度；煤炭、木材和水泥已实行了统一送货制度。东北的几个铁路车站和大连港及上海港已实行粮食水陆联运。但是，我们的计划工作还不是完全建立在可靠的基础上的，货源货流的调查资料缺乏产、运、销平衡的可靠依据，年度运量计划还有偏高偏低的现象。在计划的执行过程中也曾经出现过“过严过死”的现象，铁路在去年底曾经进行过批判，但又产生了“过松过宽”的现象，今年2月铁路取消了应有的计划外罚款后，计划外运输即由原来占9％左右而上升到13％左右，运输计划性因而降低。货物运输不合理现象，如重复、对流、过远和迂回运输等也很严重，1955年铁路上就占总运量的7.2％。为此，我们必须继续加强运输计划工作，经济合理地使用各种运输工具。建议中央各主要物资部门在制订产销计划的同时，根据物资的流量和合理流向，编制运输计划，并建立和健全运输计划机构。继续推行主要物资的分区产销平衡合理运输制度和统一送货制度。各省、自治区也应在本地区内，从主要物资入手，推行这两个制度，并随时总结经验，加以推广。运输各部门也应认真防止和监督不合理运输的产生。大力推行水陆联运工作，由铁道部、交通部制订铁路、水路、公路运输的分工方案，按月或按季编制水陆联运计划。降低水运和公路运输的成本和运价，以便增加水运比重和尽量利用汽车作短距离运输。
    运输和邮电的基本建设工作的进展
    在运输和邮电的基本建设工作方面，一年半来也有了很大的进展。截至今年五月底，全国铁路通车里程已约达27，362公里；过去的三年零五个月中共修建新线3，071公里，完成了五年计划的75％。集宁—二连、丰台—沙城、黎塘—湛江、蓝村—烟台等铁路已于去年通车；今年内，黔桂铁路金城江至麻尾段已经修复通车，宝鸡—成都铁路将于七月初接轨，同时兰州—新疆铁路可以铺轨到玉门，鹰潭—厦门铁路也可于今年底完成铺轨，包头—兰州、内江—昆明等铁路都已在南北两头同时动工；武汉长江大桥已开始了架梁准备工作，即可提前一年于明年建成。自1953年至今年四月底，共修建公路37，310公里（包括简易公路），全国公路通车里程到今年四月底止已达183，000公里。船舶载重吨位1955年内增加了95，706吨，截至今年五月底，已完成五年计划任务的60.9％。我国自己设计施工的湛江海港第一期工程即将完工。民用航空已经开辟了通向越南、缅甸等的国际航线，今年在国内航线中，与西藏通航已经成功，至五月底，民航通航里程已达17，194公里。邮电基本建设投资1955年完成了计划95％。全国长途电信线路截至1955年底已达十四万余杆程公里，已完成五年计划任务的96.5％；自办邮电局、处到今年五月底止已达17，609处；同四十三个国家建立了国际通邮通电关系。预计第一个五年计划中规定的运输和邮电事业的基本建设任务，都将提前完成和超额完成。近一年来，运输和邮电的基本建设各部门为了“又多、又快、又好、又省”地完成任务，作出了不少成绩。改善了设计工作，加强了施工管理，采用了先进的技术，如桥梁基础工程中的世界创举大型管柱钻孔法，土石方工程中的大爆破等等，使长江大桥、鹰—厦铁路、宝—成铁路都可提前一年或二年完成。工程造价也有降低，以铁路为例，去年下半年采取了降低造价的措施后，新线造价平均每公里降低了十二万元。但是缺点还是严重的，在施工指导上还存在着赶工图快，忽视质量的倾向，加上水文、地质资料不足，选线定线时有很大盲目性，施工期间也未及时纠正，因而往往造成工程质量不好。如宝—成线已发现了严重的坍方和隧道限界不够标准的情况，广元至略阳段仅一百四十公里，大小坍方即达五百余处之多；有的铁路修通后必要的运输设备不全，影响及时交付营业。在公路、海港、铁路工程施工中的伤亡事故也是严重的。运输邮电部门对于原有技术设备的技术改造工作重视不够。铁路方面，1955年技术改造的投资计划就没有完成，今年由于运量增长，原有运输繁忙的区段负担越来越重，形成紧张状态。对于有关职工生活福利的建筑，几年以来，修建不够，特别是职工住宅缺乏，有的职工因此几年来夫妇分居，也有因此不能结婚的。为此，我们必须提高工程的质量，加强设计工作，简化设计程序，提高总体设计质量，大量推广定型设计，扭转由于任务增加而产生的设计赶不上施工的局面；加强地质、水文的调查研究工作；提高施工技术水平，严格操作纪律；加强对职工的安全教育，改善劳动保护设备，消除重大工伤事故。加强对原有设备的技术改造工作。应该继续降低工程造价，加强施工组织，减少窝工和浪费。逐步修建职工宿舍和必要的福利设备，以改善职工生活条件。总之，各项基本建设工作，既要考虑客观需要求多、求快，同时又要把多、快放在积极可靠的基础上，并在好、省和安全的前提下求多、求快，任何孤立地、片面地强调那一面，都将给国家和人民带来损失。
    地方交通工作发展中的问题
    我国地方交通工作在1955年也有很大的发展，特别是自去年下半年农业合作化高潮到来之后，群众修路热情更为高涨，在今年第一季度形成了全国性的筑路高潮。但由于我国地区辽阔，原有公路很少，过去几年来交通部门对地方交通建设又缺乏应有的重视和全面规划，因而发展很慢，不能满足农村运输上的需要；在全国农业发展纲要公布之后，则又产生了急躁情绪。有些地区企图把规划在7年或12年内完成的工作，要在三、五年或更短的时期内完成，因而未能密切结合生产需要，过多地占用土地，造成浪费民力和耽误农业生产的现象，有些地区修成的道路，质量也不好。对于私营轮船、汽车和个体运输业的社会主义改造，基本上是健康的，但也存在着合营时财产估价偏低，忽视非实职人员的安排，在个体运输业的合作化运动中过早地追求高级形式，公积金和非生产开支过多，社员收入减少等等缺点。因此，今后在地方交通建设中，必须稳步前进，既要反对右倾保守、裹足不前，又要反对盲目冒进、贪多图快。
    要做到城乡间邮电畅通
    邮电事业也有了发展，总业务量比1954年增长13％，邮电业务总收入1955年完成计划的103.4％，已达1957年计划水平的92.5％，预计第一个五年计划中的邮电业务量也有可能超额完成。一年多来，我们增设了邮电服务机构，扩大了服务面。提高了通信质量。整顿了组织机构，实行了行政人员的定员管理，建立和贯彻了一些改进企业管理的制度。
    为了充分满足我国国民经济迅速发展的需要，为了改变我国运输邮电技术装备落后、数量少、分布不平衡的落后面貌，我们决不能满足已有的这些成绩，还必须戒骄戒躁；在今后两、三个五年计划内，为建设一个现代化的以铁路为骨干的铁路、水路、公路、民用航空互相联结的交通运输网，和现代化的邮电通信网而努力。这就是说，要大量发展西北、西南及边疆地区的铁路和全国地方道路；增加水运通航里程，开辟运河；把我国的内地和边疆、城市和乡村连结成一个整体；采用各种先进技术，逐步实现铁路电气化、自动化；在邮电事业方面，大量敷设长途电缆，装设多路载波机，增加城市自动电话容量，逐步普及乡村邮政、县内电话和有线广播，做到城乡间邮电畅通。
    根据事业、企业的性质和在国民经济中不同的作用，实行中央与地方的分工管理
    由于运输邮电事业的日益发展，我们必须依靠各级人民委员会，各级企业的领导机构，充分发挥职工群众的积极性，创造性，共同管好运输和邮电工作。因此应该根据事业、企业的性质和在国民经济中不同的作用，实行中央与地方的分工管理。凡地方性较大的事业、企业，应由地方管理，以充分发挥地方的积极性。中央直接管理的事业、企业，也要实行双重领导，加强地方党委、政府对他们的监督检查。应该明确部与所属企业机构的事权划分，不应将大小事情都集中到部里来，使部的领导忙于事务陷于被动，不能发挥所属企业的积极性。必须在计划、财务、人事和经营管理方面给所属事业、企业以一定程度的自主权；以便领导机关腾出手来加强对方针、政策上的研究和指导，制定重要的规章制度，掌握计划和财务上的平衡，统一技术标准，加强检查督促工作，及时帮助所属事业、企业解决工作中的重大问题，克服工作中的缺点和错误；只有这样，才能加强部对所属事业、企业的具体领导。我们还应该充分发扬民主，倾听职工群众的意见，关心他们的生活；重视职工的合理化建议和创造发明，继续开展先进生产者运动。我相信，在中国共产党和国务院的领导下，我们完全能够克服工作中的任何困难和缺点，在我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业中，继续胜利地前进。
