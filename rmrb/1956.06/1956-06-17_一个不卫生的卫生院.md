    An Unhygienic Health Center
    To the Editor:
    The Cang County Health Center in Hebei Province is too dirty. The bedding in the wards has not been washed for a long time and has become black; many hospitalized patients have to bring their own bedding. There is a nauseating smell in the wards, and some patients light incense in front of their beds. The roofs and windowpanes of the wards are covered with dust, and the roads around the wards are littered with broken bottles, broken shoes, and waste paper. The bloodstains in the operating room are also not cleaned.
    Such an unhygienic health center has already frightened many patients. The Cang County People's Committee should look into this matter and order the health center to improve its hygiene.
                                        Junxun, Peirui, and eight others

    一个不卫生的卫生院编辑同志：
    河北省沧县卫生院太肮脏了。病房里的被褥长期不拆洗，已经变得乌黑了；许多住院的病员只好自带被褥。病房里有着令人作呕的气味，有些病人就在床前点上香。病房的屋顶和玻璃窗都满布着灰尘，病房周围的路旁扔满了破瓶子、破鞋和乱纸等，手术室里的污血也无人清除。
    这样不卫生的卫生院，已经使很多病人见而生畏了。沧县人民委员会应该过问一下这件事，责成卫生院做好卫生工作。
