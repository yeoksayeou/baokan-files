    National Ethnic Education Conference Discusses Planning for Ethnic Education Undertakings
    Universalize Primary Education in General Ethnic Areas for Nine to Twelve Years
    Number of Ethnic Minority Primary Schools Has Grown to Over 27,000
    (Our Dispatch) The Second National Ethnic Education Conference, currently being held in Beijing, has begun discussing and formulating the twelve-year (1956-1967) plan for national ethnic education undertakings.
    This conference opened in Beijing on the 4th. After summarizing the ethnic education work of the past few years and discussing and formulating the twelve-year plan for ethnic education undertakings, the conference will also study issues such as teaching in ethnic minority languages, training and improving teachers, compiling textbooks in ethnic minority languages, and strengthening educational administrative leadership.
    Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education, pointed out in his opening speech that the two important tasks of ethnic education undertakings are to train ethnic minority cadres and vigorously improve the people's cultural level. To accomplish these two tasks, ethnic minority areas must formulate corresponding plans and measures based on the specific conditions of each region.
    Lin Liru, Vice Minister of Education, delivered a report on the national ethnic education work at the conference, affirming the achievements of ethnic education work in recent years, and explaining the draft twelve-year plan for ethnic education undertakings and several issues related to improving the quality of ethnic education. This plan was proposed based on the National Education Twelve-Year Development Plan, combined with the characteristics of various ethnic minority areas. He pointed out that, due to the uneven development of education undertakings in various ethnic minority areas and different specific conditions, it is necessary to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, while also preventing rash advances. In general areas, primary education should be universalized in nine to twelve years to catch up with the national level of development.
    (Our Dispatch) China's national ethnic education undertaking is developing vigorously. As of the end of last year, there were a total of 27,100 primary schools established for ethnic minority children nationwide, nearly double the number in 1951. The total number of ethnic minority primary school students was more than 2.46 million, an increase of more than one and a half times compared to 1951. There are 281 specialized ethnic minority middle schools and teacher training schools, with more than 193,000 students, an increase of more than threefold compared to 1951.
    In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, before liberation, more than 90% of young people were illiterate, but now there are 87,000 ethnic minority primary school students. On average, one young person out of every 112 ethnic minority people in the entire region is receiving secondary education (excluding secondary specialized schools). This autonomous region has also established the Inner Mongolia Normal College and the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine College, two institutions of higher learning that never existed before, as well as secondary specialized schools in industry, commerce, forestry, agriculture and animal husbandry, and health.
    In the Tibetan region of Tibet, there were no schools at all before liberation. In 1952, the People's Government established the first primary school in Lhasa. Now there are 31 primary schools in the entire region. The first middle school will also be established this year.
    In Xinjiang, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Sichuan and other provinces, the ethnic education undertakings in ethnic minority areas have also made great progress.
    In developing ethnic minority education undertakings, the local People's Governments have paid special attention to the training of ethnic minority teachers. All relevant areas have established ethnic minority secondary normal schools, or enrolled ethnic minority students in general normal schools. As of the end of last year, there were more than 13,000 ethnic minority normal school students nationwide. In addition, the People's Government has also deployed a certain number of Han teachers to help carry out education work in ethnic minority areas.

    全国民族教育会议讨论民族教育事业规划 
    一般民族地区九年到十二年普及小学教育
    少数民族小学已发展到二万七千多所
    本报讯　正在北京举行的第二次全国民族教育会议，开始讨论和制定全国民族教育事业的十二年（1956—1967）规划。
    这次会议是四日在北京开幕的。会议在总结几年来的民族教育工作和讨论、制定民族教育事业的十二年规划之后，还将研究用本民族语文进行教学、培养和提高师资、用民族文字编写教材和加强教育行政领导等问题。
    教育部副部长董纯才在致开幕辞时指出，民族教育事业的两项重要任务是培养民族干部和大力提高人民文化水平。要完成这两项任务，各民族地区必须根据各地区的具体条件订出相应的计划和措施。
    教育部副部长林砺儒在会上作了关于全国民族教育工作的报告，肯定了几年来民族教育工作的成绩，并对民族教育事业十二年规划草案和提高民族教育质量的几个问题作了解释。这个规划是根据国民教育十二年发展规划结合各民族地区特点提出的。他指出，由于各个民族地区教育事业发展不平衡，具体条件不同，因此，既要克服右倾保守思想，同时也要防止冒进。一般的地区要在九年到十二年中普及小学教育，赶上全国发展水平。
    本报讯　我国民族教育事业正蓬勃发展。截至去年年底，全国为少数民族儿童设立的小学共有二万七千一百多所，比1951年增加了将近二倍。民族小学生共有二百四十六万多人，比1951年增加了一倍半以上。专设的民族中学和师范共有281所，学生十九万三千多人，比1951年增加三倍多。
    在内蒙古自治区，解放前，青年中文盲占90％以上，而现在已有民族小学生八万七千人；全区平均112个民族人口中就有一个青年正在受中等教育（不包括中等专业学校）。这个自治区还创办了从未有过的内蒙古师范学院和畜牧兽医学院两所高等学校，还有工业、商业、林业、农牧、卫生等中等专业学校。
    西藏地区的藏族，在解放前根本没有学校。1952年，人民政府在拉萨办了第一所小学后，现在全区已有三十一所小学。今年还要办第一所中学。
    在新疆、湖南、云南、贵州、青海、四川等省，少数民族地区的民族教育事业也都有了很大的发展。
    在发展少数民族教育事业中，各地人民政府特别注意了民族师资的培养。各有关地区都创办了民族中等师范学校，或者在一般师范学校中招收民族学生。截至去年底，全国已有民族师范生一万三千多人。另外，人民政府还调配了一定数量的汉族教师帮助开展少数民族的教育工作。
