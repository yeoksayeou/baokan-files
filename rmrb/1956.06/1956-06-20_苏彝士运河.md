The Suez Canal

Between the Nile Delta in Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula lies a narrow strip of land connecting Asia and Africa, known as the Isthmus of Suez. To the south of the isthmus is the Red Sea, and to the north is the Mediterranean Sea. The Suez Canal is located here. It is a waterway connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, and is an important hub for international transportation.

As early as ancient Egypt, the Egyptian people had dug a canal called the Pharaoh's Canal. The Pharaoh's Canal flowed into the Red Sea at the Port of Clysma. This canal was used for thousands of years in Egyptian history, and later silted up.

The plan to open up the Isthmus of Suez to connect the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea was proposed as early as the Middle Ages. In the early nineteenth century, the Egyptian government engineer Linant officially formulated a detailed plan for the construction of the Suez Canal. In 1854, Ferdinand de Lesseps, who had served as the French Deputy Consul in Egypt, used Linant's construction plan as a blueprint and proposed the construction of the Suez Canal to Said, the Governor of Egypt, and obtained the consent of the Egyptian government. The two parties signed a treaty to open the canal, and Lesseps organized the "International Suez Canal Company," which was supplied with the land occupied by the canal free of charge by Egypt, to carry out the project.

In the spring of 1859, the canal project began, and it took ten years to complete. Most of the work on this project was done by the hands of tens of thousands of conscripted laborers. Overwork caused the death of 20,000 workers. The Suez Canal was created by the blood and sweat of the Egyptian working people. The vast majority of the construction costs were also borne by Egypt.

The canal officially opened in 1869. The canal is 175 kilometers long. The canal is 135 meters wide, and the shallowest part is twelve meters deep. Ships with a displacement of 45,000 tons can pass without hindrance. It connects Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea with the city of Suez on the Red Sea.

After this canal opened, it greatly shortened the voyage from Europe to Asia. The voyage from Plymouth, England, to Bombay via the Suez Canal is 6,200 nautical miles, while the voyage around the Cape of Good Hope is 10,500 nautical miles, a reduction of approximately 41%. The voyage from Marseille to Bombay was also halved.

Sovereignty over the Suez Canal belongs to Egypt. However, from the first day of the establishment of the Suez Canal Company, all the benefits generated by the Suez Canal were taken away by it. The Suez Canal Company has a total of 400,000 shares, each with a value of 500 francs, and the Egyptian government purchased more than 100,000 shares. At that time, French capital accounted for more than one-half of the total capital, and France controlled the canal. In 1875, taking advantage of Egypt's financial difficulties, Britain seized the opportunity to acquire half of the shares of the Suez Canal Company. At the same time, the number of British directors in the Suez Canal Company increased from the original three to ten. Since then, Britain has gradually gained de facto control of the Suez Canal Company and became the owner of the Suez Canal.

The construction cost of the canal was 400 million gold francs, but in the sixty years from 1870 to 1930, the profits of the Suez Canal Company reached 3.5 billion gold francs. According to the London publication "Statistics," by the end of 1949, Britain had already obtained 63 million pounds in profits from the "Suez" Canal Company.

The Suez Canal not only brought huge commercial profits to Britain, but it also had important strategic value. Because of this, Britain fabricated an excuse in 1882 and occupied the Suez Canal Zone. Since then, it has built military bases in the Suez Canal Zone. According to the British "Times," "The entire Suez Canal area is simply an armed area, full of military camps, airfields... In the Suez Canal area alone, the Royal Air Force has more than a dozen bases." In Fayid, Britain established the largest military camp, which covers an area of 49,000 feddans (one feddan equals more than three mu in China), which is 10,000 feddans larger than Cairo. No Egyptians are allowed to enter here because it is the headquarters of the British Middle East military. In Abu Sultan, there is the largest arsenal in the Near East. A large airport extending ten kilometers was built near Abu Suweir.

In 1936, Britain forced Egypt to sign a twenty-year unequal treaty. The treaty stipulated that Britain had the right to station 10,000 troops and 400 aircraft in the Suez Canal Zone. In wartime, Britain had the right to use all of Egypt's ports, airports, and transportation routes. At the same time, it was also stipulated that the construction costs of the British military barracks in the Suez Canal Zone would be entirely borne by Egypt.

The Egyptian people have always struggled to abolish this unequal treaty and restore national sovereignty. At the strong request of the Egyptian people, the Egyptian government has held many negotiations with the British government, demanding that the British army withdraw from Egypt. However, due to the British government's procrastination, the negotiations have not yielded any results. Britain has repeatedly promised to withdraw its troops stationed in the Suez Canal Zone, but has never done so, and has instead increased its troops in large numbers.

On August 26, 1951, on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, the Egyptian people held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration, demanding the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the withdrawal of British troops. In October of the same year, the Egyptian Parliament passed the government's proposed bill to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Since then, the Egyptian people have launched an even more intense anti-British struggle.

As a result of the long-term struggle of the Egyptian people, Britain was forced to sign an agreement on the Suez Canal with Egypt in October 1954. According to this agreement, the British troops in the Suez Canal area would be completely withdrawn within twenty months. After the British troops withdrew, the equipment of the British military bases in the Suez Canal area would be handed over to British "civilian contracting companies" for maintenance and management. The term of the agreement was seven years. During this period, British aircraft could fly over the Suez Canal area after giving prior notice to Egypt, and land there, using the airport facilities. At the same time, it was also stipulated that once Egypt and the other eight countries currently participating in the Arab League and Turkey were subjected to "armed attack," Egypt would also provide Britain with "the necessary facilities to put this base on a war footing and use it effectively."

On June 13th, the last British soldier withdrew from Egypt. The Egyptian government announced that the Egyptian people would celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt on the 18th and 19th. This is a victory for the long-term struggle of the Egyptian people. Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser said a few days ago when talking about the last British soldier leaving Egyptian territory, "A new page will be opened in the history of Egypt. But this does not mean the end of the struggle." The Egyptian people are continuing to struggle to consolidate their national independence and freedom.

    苏彝士运河
    在埃及的尼罗河三角洲和西奈半岛之间，有一条连接亚非两洲的狭长地带，称为苏彝士地峡。地峡的南面是红海，北面是地中海。苏彝士运河就在这里。它是连接红海和地中海的一条水道，是国际交通的重要枢纽。
    早在埃及远古的时候，埃及人民就曾开凿一条名叫发洛的运河。发洛运河在客来斯马港流入红海。这条运河在埃及历史上曾经使用了几千年，后来淤塞了。
    凿通苏彝士地峡以打通红海和地中海的计划，在中世纪时就有人提出过了。十九世纪初期，埃及政府的工程师里南德正式拟定了开凿苏彝士运河的详细计划。1854年曾任法国驻埃及副总领事的费迪南·德·勒赛普即以里南德的开凿计划为蓝本，向埃及总督赛德提出了开凿苏彝士运河的计划，得到埃及政府的同意。双方签订了开凿运河的条约，由勒赛普组织“国际苏彝士运河公司”，由埃及无偿地供给运河所占的土地，来进行这项工程。
    1859年春，运河工程开始动工，进行了十年才算完成。这项工程的大部工作都是依靠强征来的几万劳工的双手做成的。由于过度的疲劳，使两万工人丧失了生命。苏彝士运河是埃及劳动人民的血汗创造的。开凿的费用绝大部分也是由埃及负担的。
    1869年运河正式开航。运河全长175公里。河面宽135公尺，最浅处也达十二公尺。排水量四万五千吨的海轮可以通行无阻。它把地中海的塞得港和红海的苏彝士城连接起来。
    这条运河通航后，大大缩短了欧洲到亚洲的航程。从英国的普利茅斯经苏彝士运河到孟买的航程为六千二百浬，如绕道好望角则为一万零五百浬，航程缩短约41％。从马赛到孟买的航程也因此缩短了一半。
    苏彝士运河的主权属于埃及。但是，从苏彝士运河公司成立的第一天起，苏彝士运河所产生的全部利益就被它剥夺了。苏彝士运河共有股票四十万张，每张五百法郎，埃及政府购买了十多万张。当时，法国资本占总资本的二分之一以上，法国控制了运河。1875年英国趁埃及财政困难的时候，便趁机收购了苏彝士运河公司半数的股票，同时英国在苏彝士运河公司中的董事席位已由原来的三席增加到十席。从此英国在实际上就逐渐地控制了苏彝士运河公司，成了苏彝士运河的主人。
    运河的建筑费是四亿金法郎，但是，从1870年到1930年的六十年间，苏彝士运河公司的利润就达到了三十五亿金法郎。据伦敦的“统计”刊物指出：到1949年末，英国已经从“苏彝士”运河公司得到了六千三百万英镑的利润。
    苏彝士运河不仅给英国带来了巨大的商业利润，而且它具有重要的战略价值。正因为这样，英国在1882年制造借口，占领了苏彝士运河区。此后，便在苏彝士运河区建筑了军事基地。据英国“泰晤士报”报道：“整个苏彝士运河区域，简直是一个武装地区，到处都是军营、飞机场……只在苏彝士运河区一地，皇家空军就有一打以上的基地”。在法依德，英国建立了最大的军营，它占地四万九千费丹（一费丹合中国三亩多），比开罗还要大一万费丹。这里不准一个埃及人进入，因为它是英国中近东军事总部所在地。在阿比·苏尔顿有着近东最大的军火库。在阿布苏威尔附近建立了延伸十公里的大飞机场。
    1936年，英国强迫埃及签订了二十年不平等条约。条约规定英国有权在苏彝士运河区驻军一万人及飞机四百架。战时英国有权使用埃及的一切港口、飞机场和交通路线。同时还规定苏彝士运河区英军营房的建筑费全部由埃及负担。
    埃及人民始终为废除这个不平等条约和恢复民族主权而斗争。埃及政府在埃及人民强烈的要求下，曾和英国政府进行了多次谈判，要求英军撤出埃及。但由于英国政府的拖延，谈判一直没有结果。英国多次答应撤出驻苏彝士运河区的军队，但一直未实现，反而大量增兵。
    1951年8月26日，正当英埃条约签订十五周年的时候，埃及人民举行了空前的大规模的示威游行，要求废除英埃条约；要求撤出英国军队。同年十月，埃及国会通过了政府所提出的关于废除英埃条约的法案。从此，埃及人民更强烈地展开了反英斗争。
    由于埃及人民长期斗争的结果，英国在1954年10月被迫和埃及签订了关于苏彝士运河的协定。根据这个协定，英国在苏彝士运河地区的军队要在二十个月内完全撤出。英军撤出后，苏彝士运河区英国军事基地的设备要交由英国“民间承包公司”来保养管理。协定的期限为七年。在这段时期内，英国的飞机经预先通知埃及后可以飞过苏彝士运河区，并在那里降落，使用机场的设备。同时还规定一旦埃及等目前参加阿拉伯联盟的八个国家和土耳其受到“武装攻击”时，埃及还要提供英国“必要的便利以便把这个基地置于战争基础之上并且有效地使用它”。
    六月十三日，最后一个英国士兵撤出埃及。埃及政府宣布：埃及全国人民定于十八日和十九日庆祝埃及共和国宣布成立三周年和全部英军撤出埃及。这是埃及人民长期斗争的胜利。埃及总理纳赛尔在前几天谈到最后一个英国士兵将撤离埃及领土的时候说，“埃及的历史将打开新的一页。但是这并不是意味着斗争的终止。”埃及人民正为巩固自己民族独立和自由而继续斗争着。　      （陈汝厚）（附图片）
