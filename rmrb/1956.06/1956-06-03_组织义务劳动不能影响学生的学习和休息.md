To the Editorial Board:

    Since the beginning of this semester, many departments in Xuchang City, Henan Province, have continuously assigned our school tasks of obligatory labor, generally with deadlines for completion. The Construction Section of the Municipal People's Committee required our school to plant 2,200 trees at the Martyrs' Cemetery and over 500 trees along North Gate Road, with a three-day deadline. Subsequently, they assigned us the task of repairing a section of road outside the North Gate, approximately 500 meters long, to be constructed with ditches on both sides and the roadbed raised by about one meter, with a one-week deadline. Simultaneously, the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Station also asked us to dig up 80 jin of pupae and required each person to catch eight rats and eight sparrows. In response to the call to green the motherland and eliminate the four pests, and to cultivate students' love for labor, the school actively organized and mobilized students to complete and even exceed these tasks. For example, our school was commended for its obligatory labor in repairing the road. In terms of eliminating the four pests, our 800-plus students caught a total of 5,000 sparrows and 4,200 rats, exceeding the figures required by the Epidemic Prevention Station.

    However, recently, we were criticized by the Municipal Greening Committee. The criticism was that we "despised labor" and "resisted labor." Have we really made such mistakes? Let the facts answer this question:

    Not long ago, the Municipal Greening Committee assigned our school the task of demolishing over 4,000 cubic meters of city walls, which means that each student would have to demolish about five cubic meters of city walls on average. According to our understanding, the strongest laborers in Xuchang City can generally demolish less than 0.8 cubic meters of city walls in one workday. If a student demolishes an average of half a cubic meter of city walls per day, it would take a full ten workdays to complete this task. In addition, the work site is far from the school, and it would take a lot of time to travel back and forth. To complete this task, it would inevitably affect students' spare-time cultural and sports activities and extracurricular scientific research activities, and even finding time for washing clothes, bathing, and getting a haircut would be difficult. More importantly, students have to attend classes for six hours and study for three hours every day, and bearing too much physical labor will inevitably affect their health. Therefore, we raised our concerns three times, requesting the Greening Committee to carefully consider reducing our task of obligatory labor. Who knew that on April 18, the Greening Committee criticized us in their mimeographed bulletin.

    We never despise labor, and we also encourage students to participate in appropriate social obligatory labor. However, we believe that mobilizing students to participate in obligatory labor must be premised on not affecting students' studies, extracurricular activities, and necessary rest. It is wrong for the Municipal Greening Committee to assign tasks of obligatory labor in this way, and similar situations may also exist in obligatory labor work in other places. This is a deviation that should be quickly corrected.

### 组织义务劳动不能影响学生的学习和休息

    组织义务劳动不能影响学生的学习和休息编辑同志：
    这学期开学以来，河南许昌市不少部门连续向我校布置义务劳动的任务，并且一般都要限期完成：市人民委员会建设科要我校在烈士墓植树两千二百株，在北关马路旁植树五百多株，限期是三天完成；接着，他们又分配我校修筑北关外的马路一段，长约五百公尺，规格是两旁挖沟，路基加高约一公尺，限期是一星期完成；与此同时，市防疫站也要求我们挖蛹八十斤，每人还得捕鼠、捕雀八只。我们为了响应绿化祖国、消除四害的号召，为了培养同学们热爱劳动的思想，校方积极地组织和发动同学完成并且超额完成了这些任务。例如在修马路的义务劳动中，我校就受到了表扬；在除四害方面，我校八百多同学一共捕捉麻雀五千只、老鼠四千二百只，超过了防疫站要求的数字。
    但是在最近，我们却受到了市绿化委员会的批评。批评的内容是“轻视劳动”、“抗拒劳动”。我们真的犯了这样的错误吗？让事实来回答这个问题吧：
    不久以前，市绿化委员会分配给我校扒城墙四千多立方公尺的任务，这就是说，平均每个学生要扒城墙约五立方公尺。据我们了解，许昌市最强的劳动力一个工作日一般也只能扒城墙不到0.8立方公尺，如果一个学生平均每天扒半立方公尺城墙，就需要整整十个劳动日才能完成这项任务。再加上工作地点离学校较远，往返还要花很多时间。如果要完成这项任务，势必会影响学生的业余文化体育和课外科学研究活动，甚至连洗衣服、洗澡、理发也会找不到时间。更重要的是，学生每天要上课六小时，自习三小时，再担负过多的体力劳动，势必影响他们的身体健康。因此，我们曾提过三次意见，要求绿化委员会慎重考虑，把我们的义务劳动的任务减轻一些。谁知道，四月十八日绿化委员会在他们的油印快报上就对我们提出了批评。
    我们决不轻视劳动，而且也鼓励学生参加适当的社会义务劳动。但是我们认为，发动学生参加义务劳动必须以不影响学生的学习，课余活动和必要的休息为前提。市绿化委员会这样来布置义务劳动的任务是不对的，而类似情况在其他地方的义务劳动工作中可能也有，这是一个偏向，应该迅速纠正。
