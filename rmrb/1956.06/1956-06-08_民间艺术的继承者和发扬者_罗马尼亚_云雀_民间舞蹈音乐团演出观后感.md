Inheritors and Promoters of Folk Art
— Reflections on the Performance of the Romanian “Skylark” Folk Dance and Music Ensemble
Li Yuanqing, Deputy Director of the Institute of National Music, Central Conservatory of Music

On a summer night in Beijing, a group of artists, after watching the performance of the Romanian “Skylark” Folk Dance and Music Ensemble, praised the breadth and humor of the program selection, the skill and artistry of the performers, and the talent of the choreographers and directors, as well as the beauty of the costumes, on their way home. One musician said that it would be impossible to achieve such success without truly loving the people's creations, and without being willing to learn diligently from the people. I think this statement is very true.

The folk art of Romania, the “Skylark’s” homeland, is very rich. The music, dance, and costumes of each region have unique local characteristics; even if only separated by a mountain or a river, they can be completely different. Romanian artists are able to achieve such outstanding results not only because they possess a rich artistic heritage, but more importantly because they value the creations of the people, are willing to work hard to learn from the people, and truly understand and are familiar with their own artistic traditions. Therefore, they are able to refine and innovate, so that the ancient folk art can shine with new brilliance. For example, the "Romanian Folk Art Institute" in Bucharest has collected and organized more than 60,000 folk literature, dance, and music works, and published a large number of materials and monographs on folk art. The Romanian People's Museum systematically collects folk costumes, art works, and daily necessities from various regions. In Romania, whether professional or amateur performing arts groups, all take learning folk art as the basis of all artistic activities. They cherish the creations of the people so much that even the smallest, most insignificant thing, as long as it is slightly commendable, is regarded as a treasure. This point is particularly worth learning from us.

For example, in the wedding customs of various parts of our country, from the perspective of music, dance, and costumes, there are many materials that can be used for artistic processing (such as the "Sitting Song Hall" in Sichuan and Hunan), but few people pay attention to it. From the performance of the "Skylark" Dance and Music Ensemble, we can see that Romanian artists can discover the interests of the people from ancient wedding customs, and create such beautiful and moving dances as "Weddings in the Somes River Area" (choreographed by Fronin Raba, composed by Viorel Dobos), and "Veil Dance" (choreographed by Damala Capu, etc., composed by Paul Constantinescu). Although these ancient wedding customs no longer exist today, the costumes, dances, and music created and loved by the people have been inherited; and after being processed by artists, these dances full of strong life atmosphere make the audience feel as if they have returned to the beautified childhood artistic conception, as if they have smelled the fragrance of their hometown soil, giving people an indescribable aesthetic enjoyment.

From the musical aspect, we can also see the importance Romanian artists attach to folk art. The only Romanian folk instruments preserved to this day are the "Nai" (which we call panpipes), the eight-stringed zither, the dulcimer, the shepherd's flute, and the bass clarinet. Some instruments are almost lost. Thanks to the unremitting promotion of the Romanian People's Republic government, not only has it rescued these arts that were about to be lost, but it has also improved and developed them. For example, music middle schools have established majors in these folk instruments, quickly cultivating a group of young performers. After listening to the national orchestra conducted by Traian Tergolyan and solo programs of "Nai" and clarinet, we were deeply attracted by those lively tunes and superb acting skills. We specifically realized that these ancient arts that have been circulating among the people for thousands of years have entered a new stage. They have not only reached a high level of artistry, but have also been infiltrated with new life and ideological feelings in the process of processing and improvement, making them an indispensable part of socialist culture.

The performances of the three singers, baritone Vi. Brujol, Jan Cristorianu, and soprano Angela Moldovan, are unforgettable. Their program selection is very wonderful, such as the folk song "Everyone Has Troubles," the general meaning of the lyrics is: "Everyone has troubles, some people have more, some people have less. But what about me? Even a train cannot carry them all!" Such lyrics are full of life's interest. And the actors' profound understanding and vivid performance of the song completely express the feelings of this young man. The heartbroken person we saw, although he has troubles that "even a train cannot carry all," is not a person who is frowning and losing interest in life, but a person who can treat his troubles with a humorous and optimistic attitude. Isn't this exactly the true character of the working people? How charming is the joyful youth shown in the songs of soprano singer Angela Moldovan!

The dance "Paintings in the Gallery," written by Fronian Raba and composed by George Ienescu, is an outstanding example of Romanian artists' creative treatment of folk art. When the curtain opens, what appears on the stage is an art gallery with huge oil paintings hanging on it. When night falls, the people in the paintings come to life. They walk out of the frames, dance to their heart's content, and tease a housekeeper, enjoying the joy of life. Until the next morning, the people in the paintings returned to the paintings. What a clever artistic conception! Only artists who have insight into the depths of people's lives can create such unforgettable works of art.

Let us deeply thank the "Skylark" Dance and Music Ensemble for giving us so many beautiful feelings, and let us also accept the very beneficial inspiration they have given us in inheriting and promoting folk art. (Attached pictures)

### 民间艺术的继承者和发扬者——罗马尼亚“云雀”民间舞蹈音乐团演出观后感

    民间艺术的继承者和发扬者
    ——罗马尼亚“云雀”民间舞蹈音乐团演出观后感
    中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所副所长　李元庆
    北京的夏夜，一群文艺工作者看了罗马尼亚“云雀”民间舞蹈音乐团的演出以后，在回家的路上，不断地赞美节目选材的宽广和风趣，赞美演技的纯熟和编导的才能，也赞美服装的美丽。一位音乐家说，如果不是真正热爱人民的创作，如果不肯下苦功向人民学习，是不可能获得这样的成就的。我觉得这句话说得很有道理。
    “云雀”的家乡——罗马尼亚的民间艺术是十分丰富的。各地区的音乐、舞蹈、服装都有独特的地方色采；甚至只相隔一山一水，也会全然不同。罗马尼亚艺术家能够获得这样优异的成绩，不仅因为他们拥有丰富的艺术遗产，更重要的是他们重视人民的创作，肯下苦工向人民学习，并且真正做到熟悉和懂得自己的艺术传统。因而他们能够去粗取精，推陈出新，使古老的民间艺术放出新的光辉。例如布加勒斯特的“罗马尼亚民间艺术研究院”搜集和整理了六万多件民间文学、舞蹈、音乐作品，出版了大量有关民间艺术的资料和专著。罗马尼亚的人民博物馆系统地搜集了各地区的民间服装、美术品和生活用具。在罗马尼亚，无论是专业的或业余的文工团，都把学习民间艺术当做全部艺术活动的基础。他们是这样地爱护人民的创作，那怕一点一滴，只要稍有可取，都视同珍宝。这一点是特别值得我们学习的。
    例如在我国各地的婚礼习俗中，从音乐、舞蹈、服装的任何一个角度来看，都有不少可以做为艺术加工的素材（如四川和湖南的“坐歌堂”），但是很少有人去注意。从“云雀”舞蹈音乐团的演出中，我们可以看到，罗马尼亚的艺术家却能从古老的婚礼风俗中发现人民的兴趣，编出像“索美什河流域一带的婚礼”，（弗罗宁·拉巴编舞，维奥列尔·道鲍斯作曲）、“头纱舞”（达玛拉·卡普等编舞，巴乌尔·康斯旦丁涅斯库作曲）这样美妙动人的舞蹈来。虽然这些古老的婚礼习俗今天不再存在了，但是，人民所创造的、人民所喜爱的服装、舞蹈和音乐却被继承下来了；而且经过艺术家的加工以后，这些充满着浓厚生活气息的舞蹈，使观众仿佛回到美化了的童年意境中去，仿佛闻到了家乡泥土的芬芳，给人难以描述的美的享受。
    从音乐方面，也可以看到罗马尼亚艺术家对民间艺术的重视。罗马尼亚的民间乐器，保存至今的只有“奈伊”（我们叫排箫）、八弦琴、大洋琴、牧笛、大黑管等有限的几种了。有的乐器几乎已经失传。由于罗马尼亚人民共和国政府不遗余力地加以提倡，不仅抢救了这些快要失传的艺术，并且使它们得到了提高和发展。例如音乐中学设立了这些民间乐器的专业。很快地培养出一批年轻的演奏家。我们听了特拉扬·特尔郭良指挥的民族乐队和“奈伊”、黑管等独奏节目，深深地被那些生动活泼的曲调和高超的演技所吸引。我们具体地体会到这些千百年来流传在民间的古老的艺术，已经进入到一个新的阶段。它们不仅达到了高度的艺术水平，并且在加工提高的过程中浸润了新的生活气息和思想感情，使它们成为社会主义文化中不可缺少的一个组成部分。
    三位歌唱家男中音维·布日奥尔、扬·克里斯托里安努和女高音安节拉·莫尔多万的演唱是令人难忘的。他们的节目选得非常精采，像“谁都有烦恼”这首民歌，歌词的大意是：“谁都有烦恼，有的人多，有的人少。可是我呢？一列火车也装不了！”这样的歌词是富有生活趣味的。而演员对歌曲的深刻理解和生动的表演，把这个年青人的心情完全表达出来了。我们看到的这个失恋者，虽然有“一列火车也装不了”的烦恼，却不是愁眉苦脸失去生活兴趣的人。而是能够用幽默、乐观的态度来对待自己烦恼的人。难道这不正是劳动人民性格的本色？女高音歌手安节拉·莫尔多万歌唱中所显示的欢快的青春，又是多么迷人呵！
    由弗罗尼安·拉巴编剧、乔治·耶涅斯库作曲的舞蹈“陈列馆中的名画”是罗马尼亚艺术家创造性地对待民间艺术的杰出例子。幕开了，舞台上出现的是悬挂着巨幅油画的美术陈列馆。夜色降临的时候，画中人复活了。他们从画框里走出来，尽情地跳着舞，还戏弄着一个管家人，享受着生活的欢乐。直到第二天早晨，画中人又回到画幅中去了。多么巧妙的艺术构思！只有洞察到人民生活深处的艺术家，才能创造出这样令人难忘的艺术品。
    让我们深深地感谢“云雀”舞蹈音乐团给我们那么多的美的感受，也让我们接受他们在继承和发扬民间艺术上所给我们的十分有益的启发。（附图片）
