Xinhua News Agency report: The Xi'an Municipal Joint State-Private Ancient and Old Book Retail Store has recently recovered more than 12,000 valuable ancient and old books in the Qin Chuan area, many of which are rare editions.

　　The Shuxin Ancient and Old Book Retail Store, which has been run by three generations for decades, sent people to Sanyuan County and bought back more than 1,000 ancient books in one go, including "Qinglu Series," "Baihai," and "Tianzhong Ji," all of which are rare editions from the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Ming edition of "Ten Thousand Quatrains of Tang Poets" and "Selected Poems, Selected Rhymes, and Four Compilations of the Military Frontier" (color edition) acquired by the Heping Ancient and Old Book Retail Store are also rare editions.

　　After becoming a joint state-private enterprise at the beginning of this year, these joint state-private ancient and old book retail stores have taken the initiative to contact many schools, libraries, and relevant agencies, and regularly introduce newly acquired valuable books. In the past two months, they have supplied complete sets of valuable ancient and old books and periodicals to many units such as the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Writers Association, Xi'an Normal College, and the Gansu Provincial Library.

　　The Qin Chuan area is one of the most culturally developed regions in Chinese history. According to preliminary understanding, in addition to Xi'an, there are many scattered classical books and collections in Sanyuan, Jingyang, Dali, Hancheng and other places.

    收集古书旧书
    据新华社讯　西安市公私合营古旧书籍零售店，最近在秦川地区收回了一万二千多本有价值的古旧书籍，其中有许多是珍贵版本。
    祖孙三辈相传经营了几十年的澍信古旧书籍零售店，派人在三原县一次就买回了一千多本古书，其中“清麓丛书”、“稗海”、“天中记”等都是明、清各代珍本。和平古旧书籍零售店收购的明版唐人万首绝句和选诗、选赋、兵垣四编（套色版）也都是珍贵版本。
    这些公私合营古旧书籍零售店，在今年初公私合营后，主动地和许多学校、图书馆、有关机关取得联系，经常介绍新收购到的珍贵书籍。最近两个月，他们给中国作家协会西安分会、西安师范学院、甘肃省图书馆等许多单位供应了整套的有价值的古旧书刊。
    秦川地区是我国历史上文化发达的地区之一。据初步了解，除西安市外，三原、泾阳、大荔、韩城等地都有不少散失的古典书籍和藏书。
