Reader's Letters Column:

    Letter from Tangshan Dongya Refractory Material Factory: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" column on April 22nd, regarding our factory's lack of enthusiasm in supporting rationalization proposals from employees, is correct. We are determined to correct this conservative ideology and bureaucratic style, further examine the shortcomings in our past rationalization proposal work, and have already assigned a specific person to take charge of this work.

    Letter from Northwest Fifth Engineering Company, Ministry of Construction Engineering: We fully accept the criticism in the "Reader's Letters" column on April 30th concerning the shortcomings in our company's employee welfare work. We are determined to correct the mistake of not caring about the lives of our employees and will, based on the actual situation of the company, make a comprehensive plan for welfare work and improve it in a planned way.

    Letter from the Grain Bureau of Hubei Province: The letter "The Method of Purchasing Grain in Installments at Fixed Times Should be Abolished," published in the "Reader's Letters" column on May 8th, is of great help to our province's grain retail departments in improving their future work. The "installment at fixed times" method of purchasing grain, which was being piloted in Wuhan City, has already been abolished.

    Letter from Anshan Lingshan Agricultural Machinery Factory: After seeing the criticism in the "Reader's Letters" column on May 8th regarding the problem of missing parts in the double-shared plows shipped to Sichuan by our factory, in addition to inquiring by telegram about the quantity of missing parts for remedial action, our factory will also actively learn packaging methods from fraternal factories to prevent the occurrence of missing parts in the future.

    Letter from the General Office of the Ministry of Construction Engineering: After the publication of the letter "Who Did the Subsidy Solve the Problem For?" in the "Reader's Letters" column on May 13th, we conducted an inspection of the usage of welfare subsidies at the North China Workers' Hospital and confirmed that the situation revealed by the reader was completely true. Zhao Delin and four others have already made written and public self-criticisms and have returned the subsidies they received.

    Letter from the Organization Department of the Liaoyuan Mining Area Trade Union of the China Coal Miners' Union: The letter "Where Did Our Archive Materials Go?" published in the "Reader's Letters" column on May 8th exposed the chaotic personnel system in our department. We sincerely accept this criticism and are determined to take effective measures to improve our future personnel work.

    The "Reader's Letters" column on April 22nd criticized the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative for using egalitarian methods to allocate labor, which affected the production enthusiasm of the members. Now, the Office of the CPC Suining County Committee in Sichuan Province has written to say that the Party branch of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative has taken measures to correct this erroneous practice.

    Letter from the CPC Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant Committee: After seeing the letter "The Loudspeaker Disturbs Our Rest" in the "Reader's Letters" column on May 20th, we conducted an inspection. In the past, our factory's wired broadcasting work did not well implement the policy of serving production, and the broadcasting time and broadcasting lines were not properly arranged according to the characteristics of production and the living conditions of the workers. Now we have separated the broadcasting lines for the production area and the dormitory area and will improve the broadcasting content to make the broadcasting station a true tool for promoting production through propaganda and education.

    Letter from Zhangjiakou City Industry Bureau: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" column on April 30th regarding the flying dust in the workshop of the Zhangjiakou Flour Factory is correct. This serious situation not only wastes flour but also affects the health of the workers. To solve this problem, we have instructed the Zhangjiakou Flour Factory to visit relevant factories in Tianjin to learn from them and find ways to improve. Now, they have made three ventilators, and the problem of flying dust in the workshop can be solved after installation.
