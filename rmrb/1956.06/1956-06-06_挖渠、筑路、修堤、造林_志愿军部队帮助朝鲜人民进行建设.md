Volunteer Army Units Help the Korean People with Construction

(Reported by our newspaper) The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units have made remarkable achievements in helping the Korean people with water conservancy projects, spring plowing, and afforestation this spring. One unit was responsible for constructing a section of the main canal, more than 20 kilometers long, in the irrigation system project in South Pyongan Province. Construction began on March 11 and was completed by the end of April. In this project, a total of more than 126,300 man-days were contributed, and more than 299,600 cubic meters of earth and stone were excavated. After inspection by the People's Committee of South Pyongan Province of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the project was found to fully meet the standards. After completing 13 canals, 3 dikes, and 2 small reservoirs in Koksan County, one unit also helped the local people build 3 kilometers of farm roads and 32 houses. The unit responsible for the reinforced concrete works and the excavation of a 20-kilometer-long main line, the "throat" of the water diversion and irrigation project in the Sungho-ri area of South Pyongan Province, used more than 57,300 workdays, excavated more than 158,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, and poured more than 1,350 cubic meters of concrete, completing the task ahead of schedule on April 21. Another unit planted more than 145,000 trees on Mount Hora, which was named "China-Korea Youth Forest" by the local people.

In the above-mentioned labor, the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army demonstrated the great internationalist spirit of infinite concern and care for the interests of the Korean people. In order to complete the water conservancy projects before spring plowing, the units in charge of the water conservancy projects persisted in working even in heavy snow and rain, and some units even carried out night operations. Labor efficiency continued to increase, and some finally reached more than four times the efficiency at the beginning of the work. Sixty-two officers and soldiers of the units participating in the Meisangchon and Koksan County water conservancy projects were commended and rewarded, and eight detachments and eighteen officers and soldiers were awarded certificates of merit by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

During the construction of various projects, the party and government at all levels and the people of various places in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea often cared for and warmly supported the Volunteer Army. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea sent a delegation to visit the troops participating in the irrigation system project in South Pyongan Province, and nine Korean art troupes made a tour of performances for the construction troops. The troops also received a large number of meat and vegetables and a large number of congratulatory letters from the people of various places.

    志愿军部队帮助朝鲜人民进行建设
    本报讯　中国人民志愿军各部队今春帮助朝鲜人民兴修水利、春耕、造林做出了显著成绩。某部担负修建平安南道灌溉系统工程中一段二十多公里长的干渠工程，从三月十一日动工，到四月底就全部竣工；在这个工程中，共出人工十二万六千三百多个，挖土、石二十九万九千六百多方，经朝鲜民主主义人民共和国平安南道人民委员会鉴定，工程完全合乎标准。某部在谷山郡完成了十三条水渠、三条水堤和两个小型水库后，又帮助当地修筑了农场公路三公里、民房三十二间。担负平安南道胜湖里地区引水灌溉工程“咽喉”部分的钢筋水泥工程和挖修二十公里长干线工程的部队，用了五万七千三百多个工，挖土、石十五万八千多方，浇灌混凝土一千三百五十多方，于四月二十一日超额完成了任务。某部在虎岩山栽植了树木十四万五千多棵，被当地人民命名为“中朝青年林”。
    在进行上述各项劳动中，志愿军官兵们表现了无限关心、爱护朝鲜人民利益的伟大国际主义精神。负担水利工程的部队，为了赶在春耕前完工，曾在大雪天和雨天坚持劳动，有的部队还进行夜间作业；劳动效率不断提高，有的最后达到开工时的四倍以上。参加梅上川和谷山郡水利工程的部队，有六十二名军官和士兵受到表扬和奖励，另有八个分队和十八名官兵获得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府授予的奖状。
    在各项工程施工期间，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各级党、政府和各地人民经常关怀和热烈支援志愿军。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾派代表团慰问参加平安南道灌溉系统工程的部队，并先后有九个朝鲜艺术团体在施工部队作巡回演出。部队还收到了各地人民慰劳的大量肉、菜和大批的慰问信。
