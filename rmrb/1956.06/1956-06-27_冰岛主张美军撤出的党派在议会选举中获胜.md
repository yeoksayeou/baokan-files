Xinhua News Agency, Reykjavik, June 26th: In the Icelandic parliamentary elections held on June 24th, the parties advocating for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iceland won a majority of seats.

    According to the final election results announced last night, the Progressive Party and Social Democratic Party alliance won twenty-five seats out of the fifty-two seats in parliament. The "People's Alliance," which includes the Unity Socialist Party and left-wing Social Democrats, obtained eight seats.

    The incumbent Prime Minister Thors' Independence Party, the only party that supports the continued presence of U.S. troops in Iceland, obtained nineteen seats, a decrease of two seats compared to the previous parliament.

    According to a United Press International report, the outcome of the Icelandic parliamentary elections is "extremely favorable to anti-American forces" and "gives control of the fifty-two-member parliament to the two-party alliance (Progressive Party and Social Democratic Party) that has pledged to drive the Americans out of the huge Keflavik Air Base." This result means "Prime Minister Thors' Independence Party has failed."

    冰岛主张美军撤出的党派在议会选举中获胜
    新华社26日讯　雷克雅未克消息：在六月二十四日冰岛议会选举中，主张美军撤出冰岛的各党派获得了大多数的席位。
    根据昨晚公布的选举最后结果，进步党和社会民主党选举联盟获得议会五十二席中的二十五席。有统一社会党和左翼社会民主党人参加的“人民联合”得到了八席。
    唯一赞成美军继续驻在冰岛的现任总理托尔斯的独立党得到了十九席，比在上届议会减少了两席。
    合众社消息说，冰岛议会选举结果“极有利于反美力量”，“把拥有五十二个议员的议会控制权给了保证把美国人逐出这个庞大的凯夫拉维克空军基地的（进步党和社会民主党）两党联盟”。这个结果意味着“托尔斯总理的独立党失败了”。
