Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 25th. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate and the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court held a meeting on the 22nd, attended by more than 5,000 people, to separately handle six counter-revolutionary elements in accordance with the policy of "leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist." Four counter-revolutionary elements who surrendered themselves were given lenient treatment with exemption from prosecution, one counter-revolutionary element who confessed his crimes after being arrested was given a lighter sentence, and another counter-revolutionary element who refused to confess and whose crimes were heinous was sentenced to death.

The four active counter-revolutionary elements who received lenient treatment with exemption from prosecution were Wang Xianjing, He Youshan, Zhou Mingguang, and Yang Yurong.

Wang Xianjing had successively participated in special agent organizations such as the Chiang gang's "Ministry of National Defense Mainland Work Office" and "Central Committee Second Group," and had received special agent technical training in communications technology and intelligence gathering. In 1955, he was sent from Taiwan to Hong Kong under the personal arrangement of a special agent boss, and was assigned by the Hong Kong special agent organization as the "Chief of the Guangzhou Central Communications Liaison Intelligence Station." In September 1955, he sneaked back to Guangzhou and actively prepared to establish a special agent radio station. However, due to the increased vigilance of the people, his activities became increasingly difficult. At the same time, he personally witnessed the socialist construction of New China develop day by day, and felt that relying on Chiang Kai-shek and imperialism was hopeless. In particular, after seeing concrete examples of the government's lenient policy being implemented, he felt that confessing and starting anew was his only way out, so in June he brought evidence of his crimes, such as the radio station, codes, and invisible ink, to surrender himself to the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau.

He Youshan joined the Chiang gang's "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense" special agent organization in Hong Kong in August 1953, and then went to Taiwan to receive special agent training. After sneaking back to the mainland in 1954, he engaged in special agent activities in Shanghai, Shaoxing and other places; in 1955, he sneaked to Guangzhou to seek opportunities for activities. Later, with the help and encouragement of his fellow villager Shao Jinwan, he confessed and surrendered to our public security organs in April of this year.

Zhou Mingguang was lured into joining a special agent organization under the Chiang gang's "Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Interior" system by Chiang gang agents stationed in Hong Kong when he went to Hong Kong from Guangzhou in December 1954 to visit relatives, and later sneaked back to Guangzhou in 1955. He surrendered himself with the support and encouragement of his wife, Zhou Huigen.

Yang Yurong went through procedures such as filling out autobiographies, resumes, and interviews in Hong Kong in August 1954, and joined an imperialist spy organization. He also received three months of specialized spy technical training in surveying warships and ordnance depots. He sneaked back to Guangzhou in April of this year, and surrendered himself to the public security organs due to education.

The Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate announced at the meeting that the above four counter-revolutionary elements, because they were able to surrender themselves, make frank confessions, and hand over various pieces of evidence or report other counter-revolutionary elements, had been granted exemption from prosecution, and it was recommended that the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee consider assigning them appropriate jobs to provide them with a way out in life.

Shao Jinwan and Zhou Huigen, who actively mobilized and encouraged counter-revolutionary elements to surrender themselves, were also commended and rewarded by the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee at the meeting.

The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court handled another two counter-revolutionary elements at this meeting according to the different circumstances.

Liao Yunsheng, a special agent of the Chiang gang's "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense," who actively engaged in counter-revolutionary activities after sneaking back to Guangzhou in January 1955 and repeatedly secretly reported military intelligence such as our ordnance depots and military exercises to the Hong Kong special agent organization, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment with leniency because he was able to make frank confessions after being arrested, hand over evidence, and report other counter-revolutionary elements.

Counter-revolutionary criminal Yuan Hexin consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities before liberation. After liberation, he successively served as the captain and deputy commander of the first detachment of the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan Border Area Column" and the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Youth Army Action Force." He also went through the procedures in Hong Kong to join an imperialist spy organization, and after sneaking back to Guangzhou, he actively developed special agent organizations and engaged in the criminal activity of subverting our people's regime. After being reported and arrested, he still refused to confess and resisted to the end. The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced Yuan to death in accordance with the policy of "severity for those who resist."

    广州市分别处理六名反革命分子
    四名投案自首的得到宽大处理
    新华社广州25日电　广州市人民检察院和广州市中级人民法院二十二日在一次有五千多人参加的大会上，根据“坦白从宽、抗拒从严”的政策分别处理了六名反革命分子。有四名自首投案的反革命分子受到免予起诉的宽大处理，一名在被捕后坦白交代了自己罪行的反革命分子被从轻判刑，另一名拒不坦白、罪大恶极的反革命分子被判处死刑。
    受到免予起诉的宽大处理的四名现行反革命分子是王显晶、贺幼山、周明光和杨裕荣。
    王显晶曾先后参加过蒋帮“国防部大陆工作处”、“中委会二组”等特务组织，接受过电讯技术和搜集情报等特务技术训练。1955年他在特务头子亲自布置下由台湾被派到香港，并且被香港的特务机关委派为“广州中心通讯交通联络情报站站长”，于1955年9月潜回广州，积极准备建立特务电台。但是由于人民群众的警惕提高，使得他的活动愈来愈困难，同时又亲眼看到新中国的社会主义建设事业一天天发展，感到依靠蒋介石和帝国主义没有希望；特别是他看到人民政府的宽大政策具体贯彻的事例后，觉得只有坦白自新才是自己的唯一出路，就在六月带同电台、密码、密写药水等罪证向广州市公安局投案自首。
    贺幼山于1953年8月在香港参加蒋帮“国防部第二厅”特务组织后，曾到台湾接受特务训练。1954年他潜回大陆后，曾在上海、绍兴等地进行特务活动；1955年潜来广州伺机活动。后来他在同乡邵金万的帮助和鼓励下，在今年四月向我公安机关坦白自首。
    周明光于1954年12月从广州到香港探亲时，被蒋帮驻香港特务诱骗加入了蒋帮“内政部调查局”系统的一个特务组织，后来在1955年潜回广州。他在他的妻子周惠根的支持和鼓励下投案自首。
    杨裕荣于1954年8月在香港曾经履行填写自传、简历和面谈审查等手续，参加了帝国主义的间谍组织，并且受过三个月的测绘军舰、军械仓库等专门的间谍技术训练。他在今年四月潜回广州，由于受到教育而向公安机关投案自首。
    广州市人民检察院在会上宣布，以上四名反革命分子由于能够投案自首，坦白交代，并且交出各种罪证或检举了其他反革命分子，决定免予起诉，并且建议广州市人民委员会考虑分配给他们适当的工作，给他们以生活出路。
    积极动员和鼓励反革命分子投案自首的邵金万和周惠根，也在大会上受到了广州市人民委员会的表扬和奖励。
    广州市中级人民法院在这次会上根据不同的情节处理了另外两名反革命分子。
    在1955年1月潜回广州后积极进行反革命活动，曾经多次把我军械仓库和军事演习等军事情报密报香港特务机关的蒋帮“国防部第二厅”特务廖云生，由于在被捕后尚能坦白交代，交出罪证和检举了其他反革命分子，被从轻判处徒刑两年。
    反革命罪犯袁贺新解放前一贯从事反革命活动，解放后历任“反共救国军粤、桂、闽、赣、湘边区纵队”和“反共救国青年军行动部队”中队长、第一支队副司令等职务，并在香港履行手续参加帝国主义间谍组织，潜回广州后又积极发展特务组织，从事颠复我人民政权的罪恶活动。他在被检举逮捕后仍拒不坦白，顽抗到底。广州市中级人民法院根据“抗拒从严”的政策，将袁犯判处死刑。
