Xinhua News Agency, Paris Dispatch: The French National Peace Conference opened in Paris on the 17th with the slogan "Strive for Disarmament and Peace in Algeria." The conference was initiated by the National Peace Council and was attended by 1,500 representatives from across the country.

The morning session heard a report on the tasks of French peace advocates and the general public in the struggle for disarmament and a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question. The reporter, Jacques Chatagner, pointed out that international tensions have eased further recently, primarily because the Soviet Union has taken many measures to strengthen peace. He said that the French public should urge the French government to take measures to facilitate the resolution of the task of disarmament.

He then emphasized that the only way to solve the Algerian problem is through peace, not war, because the problem can only be solved on the basis of an agreement between the parties concerned.

After the report, a general discussion unfolded. Speakers focused on the Algerian question, emphasizing the danger of intensifying and expanding the military conflict in Algeria.

The conference closed on the 18th. The conference unanimously adopted an appeal to Prime Minister Mollet, requesting him to explore all avenues for ending the Algerian war and resolving the Algerian question peacefully.

The appeal emphasized that the French government must strive to achieve universal disarmament and reconciliation between East and West, and that the recent Franco-Soviet talks in Moscow have made a significant contribution in this regard.

The conference decided to launch a nationwide campaign to collect signatures for a declaration demanding a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question.

    法国和平会议发出呼吁书
    要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎讯　法国全国和平会议十七日在巴黎开幕，会议的口号是“争取裁军和阿尔及利亚和平”。这次会议是由全国和平理事会倡议召开的，出席会议的有全国各省的代表一千五百人。
    上午会议听取了关于法国和平拥护者和全体公众在争取裁军和争取和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的斗争中的任务的报告。报告人雅克·夏塔尼埃指出，最近国际紧张局势有了进一步的缓和，这首先是因为苏联采取了许多加强和平的措施。他说，法国公众应当促使法国政府采取措施，促使裁军的任务获得解决。
    他接着强调说，解决阿尔及利亚问题的唯一办法是和平，而不是战争，因为这个问题只有在有关双方取得协议的基础上才能解决。
    报告之后，展开了一般讨论。发言者着重谈到阿尔及利亚问题，强调指出阿尔及利亚军事冲突激烈化和扩大的危险。
    会议于十八日闭幕。会议一致通过给摩勒总理的呼吁书，要求他探讨结束阿尔及利亚战争和以和平办法解决阿尔及利亚问题的一切道路。
    呼吁书强调指出，法国政府必须力促实现普遍裁军和东西方的和解，最近在莫斯科举行的法苏会谈已经在这方面作出了巨大贡献。
    会议决定发起一次全国性运动，为要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的宣言征集签名。
