Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch from New York: An article in the upcoming June 15th issue of the U.S. "Foreign Policy Association Bulletin" states that anti-American sentiment is growing in Canada. People from all walks of life are increasingly concerned about U.S. economic penetration and other actions that infringe upon Canadian sovereignty, and they are demanding that the government take measures to protect Canadian interests.

The article states that the total U.S. investment in Canada has reached $9.6 billion, and its control over the basic sectors of the Canadian economy is becoming increasingly dominant, a situation that "increases the general sense of alarm." At the same time, the U.S.'s practice of dumping surplus wheat on the world market has also angered Canada, which itself has a large surplus of wheat that is causing it concern.

The article talks about the widespread development of nationalist sentiment in Canada. It says that since the opening of the Canadian Parliament this year, the opposition parties have been attacking the government for "selling Canada to the United States." Many people demand that Canada should limit its export of raw materials and insist on processing more raw materials domestically, that Canadians should have equal control over American branch companies in Canada, and that Canadian workers should not be controlled by American leaders of international trade unions. The government's proposed plan for an American company to build a trans-Canada gas pipeline has also been widely criticized.

The article says that in addition to these economic problems, threats to Canadian sovereignty have also aroused anti-American sentiment in the country. For example, the radar system built by the United States in the Canadian Arctic and sub-Arctic regions is seen as "a threat to Canadian sovereignty." Canadians feel "uncomfortable relying on the United States for their defense. Some have suggested that Canadian forces stationed in Europe under NATO command should be transferred back to Canada for its defense."

Dulles's "brinkmanship" policy has also caused unease in Canada. Canadians are also "becoming impatient with the U.S. policy towards Communist China."

Xinhua News Agency, June 13th dispatch from Paris: The "International Forum" weekly's Ankara correspondent said in a dispatch that Turkey is experiencing a diplomatic crisis that may become a prelude to a re-evaluation of its foreign policy of alliance with the United States.

The dispatch, published in the June 1st issue of "International Forum" weekly, stated: Indeed, despite the many promises made by the United States to Turkey, "America's most loyal ally in the Middle East," they have all been empty words. Indeed, a large number of loans have been granted, but these funds have been used almost entirely to build airports and military facilities, which do nothing to improve Turkey's economic situation or raise the living standards of its residents. On the contrary, the United States has forced the militarization of the Turkish economy, which has only increased the country's international debt and increased the burden of taxes on the people. The fact that current food prices are ten times higher than in 1938 illustrates this situation.

The dispatch said that the growing anti-American sentiment among Turkish leaders (including those who once most enthusiastically supported American policies) did not arise suddenly. For several years, relations between the two countries have been in an increasingly awkward state of deterioration.

Ankara sources recalled that after the Turkish Parliament passed a bill in 1954 that exempted Americans residing in Turkey from Turkish jurisdiction, several incidents occurred in which American military personnel caused trouble, behaving like "occupiers." This happened on Turkish National Day, when four American soldiers tore down the Turkish flag and insulted it.

People also accuse the Americans of being responsible for a fire: a fire in February caused by the explosion of a reconnaissance balloon spying on Soviet territory destroyed most of the historic ancient city of Gilz.

Xinhua News Agency, June 13th dispatch from Bangkok: Recent news published in Thai newspapers proves the increasing anti-American sentiment among Thai residents.

An article entitled "We Don't Need Washington" published in the "Thai Newspaper's" weekly publication stated that it is nothing new for the United States to interfere in Thailand's internal affairs in the political, economic, and military fields under the name of the United Nations and in the guise of aid. This is just a trick that the Thai people already deeply understand.

The article continued, "This interference shows the United States' disrespect for the independence and sovereignty of other countries. We don't understand why our government takes such an indifferent stance, allowing foreign countries to control our own will. Why does our government consult with Washington on international issues such as recognizing China or trading with China?"

The "Independence" weekly wrote that the Thai people have already learned that Thailand's accession to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has added new troubles for itself. This weekly also said: "Because we follow the United States in everything, we have to encounter all kinds of difficulties in the economic, political, social, and cultural aspects."

The "Independence" weekly wrote that the Thai people are dissatisfied that the United States, in addition to interfering in Thai politics, is also stifling our national economy by providing Thailand with aid that requires a very high price.

### 美国对其“盟国”的侵犯和掠夺越来越甚  加拿大、土耳其和泰国反美情绪日益强烈

    美国对其“盟国”的侵犯和掠夺越来越甚
    加拿大、土耳其和泰国反美情绪日益强烈
    据新华社柏林电　纽约消息：定于六月十五日出版的一期美国“外交政策协会公报”刊载一篇文章说，在加拿大，对美国不满的情绪日趋强烈，各界人士对美国的经济渗入和侵犯加拿大主权的其他行动越来越感到忧虑，他们要求政府采取保护加拿大权益的措施。
    文章说，美国在加拿大的投资总数已达九十六亿美元，它对加拿大经济的基本部门的控制越来越占优势，这种情况“增加了普遍的惊恐情绪”。同时，美国在世界市场上倾销剩余小麦的做法也激怒了加拿大，因为加拿大自己也有大量的剩余小麦在使它忧虑。
    文章谈到在加拿大广泛发展的民族主义情绪。它说，自从今年加拿大议会开幕以来，各反对党一直攻击政府“把加拿大卖给美国了”。许多人要求，加拿大应当限制它的原料出口并且坚持把更多的原料在国内加工，要求加拿大人对于美国在加拿大的分公司应当有平等的控制权，加拿大的劳工不应当受国际工会的美国领导人控制。政府提出的由美国公司兴建横贯加拿大的煤气管的计划，也受到了广泛的抨击。
    文章说，除了这些经济问题以外，加拿大主权所受到的威胁也激起了国内的反美情绪。例如，美国在加拿大北极和亚北极地区建造的雷达系统，就被认为是“对加拿大主权的威胁”。加拿大人对于他们的防御要依靠美国这一点是感到“不愉快的。有人建议把北大西洋公约组织指挥下驻在欧洲的加拿大部队调回来，用于加拿大的防御”。
    杜勒斯的“战争边缘”政策也引起了加拿大的不安。加拿大人“对美国对于共产党中国的政策也感到不耐烦了”。
    据新华社13日讯　巴黎消息：“国际论坛”周刊驻安卡拉特派记者在一篇电讯中说，土耳其正在经历着一个外交危机，这个危机可能成为对同美国联盟的外交政策进行重新估计的前奏。
    “国际论坛”周刊六月一日刊载的这篇电讯说：的确，美国对“美国在中东的最忠实的盟国”土耳其所作的诺言虽然很多，却尽是空话。的确给予了大批贷款，但是，这些款项几乎完全用来修建飞机场和军事设备了，这些工程对改善土耳其的经济情况和提高居民生活水平方面毫无好处。相反，美国强令土耳其经济军事化，只是增加了这个国家的国际债务，增加了压在人民头上的捐税负担。目前的食品价格比1938年高十倍，这个事实就说明了这种情况。
    电讯说，土耳其领袖们（包括一度最热烈地支持美国政策的人）中增长着的反美情绪，并不是突然产生的。好几年来，两国之间的关系就处于日益恶化的尴尬局面下。
    安卡拉人士追述说：1954年土耳其议会通过了一个法案使居住在土耳其的美国人不受土耳其本国法权管辖，以后，好些美军人员曾数度肇事，俨然是“占领者”。土耳其国庆节那天就发生了这种情况，四名美国军士扯下土耳其的国旗，加以侮辱。
    人们还指责美国人应对一次火灾负责：二月间由于一个侦察苏联领土的侦察气球爆炸而引起的火灾，烧毁了历史性古城吉尔兹的大部分。
    据新华社13日讯　塔斯社曼谷消息：最近泰国报刊所刊载的消息，证明了泰国居民中的反美情绪日益增强。
    “泰报”的星期刊以“我们不需要华盛顿”为题发表的一篇文章说，美国用联合国的名义和以援助的方式，来干涉泰国政治、经济和军事各方面的内政，这并不是什么新的东西了。这只是已经为泰国人民所深深了解的诡计。
    文章继续写道，这种干涉说明了美国不尊重其他国家的独立和主权。我们不明白，为什么我们政府采取这种漠不关心的立场，允许外国控制我们自己的意志呢，为什么我们政府在承认中国、或是同中国贸易这类国际问题上要同华盛顿进行协商呢？
    “独立”周刊写道，泰国人民已经知道，泰国加入了东南亚条约组织以后，给自己添了新的麻烦。这家周刊又说：“由于我们一切都追随美国，我们就不得不在经济、政治、社会和文化方面遭到各种各样的困难。”
    “独立”周刊写道，泰国人民感到不满意的是：美国除了干涉泰国的政治以外，还用给予泰国须要付出很高的代价的援助来窒息我们的国民经济。
