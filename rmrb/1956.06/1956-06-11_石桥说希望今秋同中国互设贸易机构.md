Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 10th: Trade and Industry Minister Tanzan Ishibashi said today in Fukuoka that the Japanese government intends to take necessary measures to ensure that the mutual establishment of trade representative offices with China can be realized this autumn.

Ishibashi said that the Japanese government cannot grant diplomatic privileges to the Chinese representatives, but the Japanese government will "take steps to treat them as diplomats in practice."

Ishibashi said that the establishment of a Chinese trade representative office will coincide with the signing of a formal payment agreement. According to this payment agreement, trade payments can be settled in Tokyo instead of in London as is currently the case.

    石桥说希望今秋同中国互设贸易机构
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本通商产业相石桥湛山今天在福冈市说，日本政府打算采取必要措施使同中国互设贸易代表机构一事能够在今年秋天实现。
    石桥说，日本政府不能给中国代表们以外交特权，不过日本政府将“采取步骤在实际上把他们当作外交官对待”。
    石桥说，中国贸易代表机构的设立将同签订正式的支付协定在同一个时候。根据这个支付协定，贸易支付的结算可以在东京而不需要像现在这样在伦敦进行。
