Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch. According to TASS: Italian Socialist Party General Secretary Nenni said that the Italian Socialist Party and the Communist Party must fight together, and there is no so-called split between the two parties.

Nenni spoke about this issue at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party held on June 7th. He also emphasized this point in his conversation with the reporter of the Polish "People's Forum" published in the newspaper on the 8th.

When reporting to the Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party, Nenni pointed out that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party must form an alliance and fight to satisfy the wishes of Italian workers, farmers and employees.

In his report, Nenni also talked about the relationship between the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party. He said that this relationship should be considered from the perspective of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party approaching each other on the basis of a new position. He also said: "The only question is how to coordinate some common activities in politics, economy and trade unions, so that the whole situation can be greatly improved, and the question also lies in making decisions closely related to the ideas and practices of Marxism."

Nenni advocated cooperation with the Social Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the Radical Party, and even the Christian Democratic Party in the governments of those places where the Socialist Party and the Communist Party hold an absolute majority.

Nenni also advocated that the Socialist Party should jointly participate in the executive bodies of provincial and municipal councils with the Christian Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the Radical Party, and the Social Democratic Party when "wider unity cannot be achieved."

In his conversation with the reporter of "People's Forum," Nenni talked about the possibility of concerted action by the various workers' parties in Italy. He pointed out that it is possible to improve the relationship between the various factions of the Italian workers' movement. Nenni said, however, that the Italian Social Democratic Party continues to oppose the united action of all workers' forces. Therefore, it is under dual pressure: on the one hand, from its own members, and on the other hand, from the left wing of the leadership.

Nenni emphasized that there is no question of a split between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Our task is to launch the struggle of the workers, the struggle of the working people for the relaxation of international tensions, for peace, and for national and social democratization. There can be no question of division. The question is to move forward, and therefore we are moving forward.

    意大利社会党总书记南尼
    强调社会党和共产党必须共同斗争
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社消息：意大利社会党总书记南尼说，意大利社会党和共产党必须共同斗争，两党之间不存在所谓分裂的问题。
    南尼在六月七日举行的意大利社会党中央委员会全体会议上谈到这个问题。他在八日波兰“人民论坛报”刊载的他对这家报纸的记者的谈话中，也强调了这一点。
    南尼在向意大利社会党中央全会作报告的时候指出，社会党和共产党必须结成联盟，为满足意大利的工人、农民和职员的愿望而斗争。
    南尼在报告中还谈到社会党同社会民主党的关系。他说，应该从社会党和社会民主党在新立场的基础上接近的前途来考虑这种关系。他还说：“问题只能够是如何使得在政治、经济和工会方面的一些共同活动配合起来，以便使整个局面有可能大大好转，问题还在于作出同马克思主义的思想和实践紧紧联系的决定。”
    南尼主张在社会党和共产党占绝对多数的那些地方的政府中同社会民主党、共和党、激进党、甚至是天主教民主党合作。
    南尼还主张，社会党在“不能取得较广泛的团结”的时候，同天主教民主党、共和党、激进党和社会民主党共同参加省、市议会的执行机构。
    在对“人民论坛报”记者的谈话中，南尼谈到意大利各工人政党的一致行动的可能性。他指出，改进意大利工人运动各派别的关系是有可能的。南尼说，但是，意大利社会民主党继续反对所有工人力量一致行动。因此它受到双重压力：一面来自自己的党员，一面来自领导机构的左翼。
    南尼强调说，社会党和共产党之间不存在什么分裂的问题。我们的任务是展开工人的斗争，展开劳动人民争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取和平、争取国家和社会民主化的斗争。不可能有分裂的问题。问题是要前进，因此我们正在前进。
