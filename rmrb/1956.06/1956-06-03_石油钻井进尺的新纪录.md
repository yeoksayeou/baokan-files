    New Record in Oil Drilling Footage
    The 3206 drilling team of the Yumen Oil Mine, which set a national drilling record of 462.3 meters per day in January this year, broke their own record on May 30th by drilling 601.5 meters in one day, once again setting a new national record for daily drilling footage.
    That morning, the first shift workers drilled very quickly, reaching a rate of two meters per minute at the fastest. At two o'clock in the afternoon, Yan Zonglu, who represented the 3206 team at the National Conference of Advanced Producers in Beijing, had just returned to the mining area. When he heard that the team was engaged in rapid drilling, he immediately took his backpack, got in a car, and rushed to the well site. The workers warmly shook his hand and said: "Today, we are fulfilling the guarantee you made to Chairman Mao in Beijing - to drill more than 500 meters and create a new national record once again." The Guo Qingyuan team, drilling during this period, created a new national record for drilling team footage with a result of 248 meters. (Petroleum Worker's Newspaper Editorial Department)

    石油钻井进尺的新纪录
    曾在今年一月份创造日进尺462.3公尺全国钻井最高纪录的玉门油矿三二零六钻井队，五月三十日又打破了他们自己的纪录，一天钻进了601.5公尺，再一次创造了全国钻井日进尺最高纪录。
    这一天早晨，第一班的工人们钻进得很快，最快的时候一分钟钻进两公尺。下午两点钟，代表三二零六队到北京参加全国先进生产者代表会议的颜宗禄刚刚回到矿区，他听说队里正在进行着快速钻进，立刻带着背包坐汽车跑到井上来。工人们亲热地握着他的手说：我们今天正在实现着你在北京向毛主席作的保证——钻进五百公尺以上，再一次创造全国新纪录。在这一段时间钻进的郭清元班，以248公尺的成绩创造了全国钻井班进尺的最高纪录。　（石油工人报编辑部）
