I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the budget and final accounts, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model regulations for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee. I suggest that the congress, after examination and discussion, approve the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, and adopt the model regulations for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives.

The 1955 national final accounts show that our country's fiscal revenue and expenditure are basically good and healthy, and that the state has provided necessary and full financial support for economic and cultural and educational construction. The 1956 national budget reflects the new situation of this year's national economy trending towards comprehensive upsurge, so both fiscal revenue and expenditure have greatly increased. This budget is compiled in accordance with the requirements of completing and overfulfilling the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, so it is an advancing budget, a budget for stepping up construction, and at the same time, a steady and reliable budget. Of the national budget expenditure, 64.96% is used for economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings. The proportion of the budget allocation, in addition to ensuring priority development of heavy industry, also actively develops light industry, agriculture, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings. This reasonable and necessary allocation ratio will undoubtedly accelerate the speed of our country's industrialization. This year, the national budget expenditure for national defense accounts for only 19.98% of the budget expenditure. This year's budget figure is more than 350 million yuan less than last year's final accounts, which reflects the deep desire of our country and people for peace. People can see from our budget expenditure that we are unwilling to use money to make guns and cannons, but are willing to use it for peaceful construction. However, we have our beliefs, which are: We will not attack unless we are attacked. When imperialism is still threatening us with war, when our territory of Taiwan is still under the occupation of American aggressors, we still have to strengthen our national defense forces to cope with unexpected events and to smash any provocations by aggressors. The national budget expenditure fully demonstrates the state's concern for the people's welfare: This year, the average salary of workers across the country will increase by 14.5%; the lives of the broad masses of farmers will be significantly improved due to the state's financial support for agricultural development and the adoption of reasonable tax and price policies; the lives of handicraftsmen and industrialists and businessmen will also be improved and enhanced as factories and shops improve their operations and management, adjust wages, and solve medical and welfare problems. Constantly improving the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of production development is the starting point and destination of our country's entire policy. The 1956 national budget vividly embodies this principle. I have repeatedly read this budget with infinite joy, and I see the beautiful prospects of our country behind many figures. I wholeheartedly support this budget and am willing to strive for its successful realization.

Here, I would like to put forward two suggestions for reference.

Since last year, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, a struggle against and criticism of right-leaning conservative thinking has been launched throughout the country. This struggle has achieved brilliant results, and has brought about profound and fundamental changes in the political situation of our country. Socialism has already won a decisive victory. However, it should also be seen that, while opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, hasty and rash tendencies have also emerged in some regions and some departments. For example, the agricultural production cooperative's production plan is too high and not comprehensive enough, the single-minded focus on agricultural production and neglect of sideline business operations, the blind promotion of new-style agricultural tools and improved varieties, the pursuit of greatness and fondness for success in the work of eliminating illiteracy, the neglect of quality and specifications in light industrial production, and so on. All these blind and rash tendencies are inconsistent with the correct requirements of opposing right-leaning conservatism. Opposing right-leaning conservatism is opposing the idea of being content with the status quo. Under the guidance of this idea, people hesitate to move forward, are timid and afraid, and bind their own hands and feet, leaving things that should be done and can be done undone, and doing things that should be done faster and can be done faster slowly. There is no doubt that this phenomenon should be opposed. Without opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, our various tasks will proceed like a snail's pace, unable to move forward, and we will make big mistakes. Hasty and rash advancement, on the other hand, is a tendency to transcend objective possibilities, a subjective tendency that does not take objective conditions into account or proceed from reality. Its result will naturally lead to losses, and in some cases, even to coercion and commandism and detachment from the masses. Therefore, even if this tendency only exists in some regions and some departments, even if this tendency is only in its infancy, we should emphasize pointing it out and vigorously overcome it. This tendency of haste and rashness certainly exists in some higher-level organs; however, because lower-level organs layer upon layer increase the tasks and shorten the deadlines for completing the tasks, it appears to be more serious. Many cadres at the lower levels have high political enthusiasm and initiative in the high tide of the socialist revolution. They have good wishes in their hearts and subjectively want to do more things for the masses, but they lack a realistic work style and their thinking methods are one-sided, so everything is being restored and advancing at the same time, which results in the tendency of haste and rashness. I think that the responsibility of leaders, on the one hand, should be to specifically and analytically examine whether the units they lead have a tendency of haste and rashness. If so, what is its degree? What impact has it had on the lower levels? How to overcome it? On the other hand, we should conduct persuasive education to lower-level organs and cadres, explaining the principle that excess and deficiency are both wrong, and let everyone understand that a struggle between two lines should be carried out, opposing both conservatism and haste and rashness. We must recognize that the problem of thinking methods is a problem that must be continuously studied and continuously improved in practical struggle over a longer period of time in order to be solved. If we do not conduct specific analysis or persuasive education, and just shout: "Oppose haste and rashness!" it will magnify the problem and lead to another extreme. And this method of pouring cold water can only make the cadres at the lower levels feel: Yesterday it was right-leaning, today it is "left"-leaning, nothing is right, and they don't know what to do—and this will cause great losses.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian mentioned in his report: "In addition to appropriately increasing the growth rate of local budgets in this year's national budget and taking care of local needs, we are also prepared to appropriately expand the authority and flexibility of local governments in financial management, so that local governments can arrange their own revenue and expenditure within the control figures of the total budget according to local actual conditions." The report also pointed out: "The correct method is to combine the principle of the central government's unified leadership and unified planning with the principle of local governments' responsibility at different levels and adapting to local conditions." The most important sign of the division of power between the central government and local governments is the authority and flexibility in financial management. The 1956 national budget began to pay attention to this point, and specific methods will be proposed soon for systematic regulations. I think this is correct. Our country has a vast territory, and there are great differences in the natural conditions, population density, ethnic conditions, economic foundation, material resources, development of undertakings, distribution conditions of national key construction, and so on in various regions. If we do not pay attention to the characteristics and differences of various regions, and the central government manages too much, too tightly, and too meticulously, it will be difficult to give play to the initiative of local governments. Many matters that should be undertaken and can be undertaken will make local governments feel that their sleeves are too short to reach their hands and they are powerless. Opposing decentralism is correct, and opposing departmentalism and localism is also correct, but giving play to the initiative of local governments and mobilizing the active forces of local governments to support the central government and support the national construction cause is also correct.

Fellow representatives: Our country is like the rising sun, thriving; the unity among our people is increasing and consolidating day by day; our meetings are getting better and better, and they are increasingly showing the youthful and vigorous vitality of our national system. For the sake of socialism, let us unite the people of all nationalities across the country, make strenuous efforts, successfully realize the 1956 national budget, successfully complete the annual plan for national economic construction in 1956, and successfully complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.

    前进的、建设的、稳妥可靠的预算
    ——程潜代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于预决算的报告、廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明、彭真副委员长关于常务委员会的工作报告；建议大会在审查和讨论之后，批准1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程。
    1955年的国家决算表明，我们国家的财政收支基本上是好的，健康的；对国家的经济建设和文化教育建设事业，财政上作了必要的、充分的支持。1956年的国家预算，反映了今年国民经济趋向全面高涨的新形势，所以财政的收入和支出都有很大的增加。这个预算是按照提前完成和超额完成五年计划的要求编制的，因此它是前进的预算，是加紧建设的预算；同时也是稳妥可靠的预算。国家预算支出当中，以64.96％用于经济建设事业和文化教育事业，预算的分配比例，除了保证优先发展重工业之外，同时还积极发展轻工业、农业、交通运输业和文化教育事业，这种合理的、必要的分配比例，无疑将要加快我国工业化的速度。今年国家预算支出的国防费类，只占预算支出的19.98％，今年的预算数比去年的决算数减少了3亿5千多万元，这反映了我们国家和人民热爱和平的深切愿望。人们从我们的预算支出中能够看到：我们的钱不愿意拿来制枪造炮，而愿意拿来从事和平建设。但是，我们有我们的信念，这就是：人不犯我，我不犯人。当帝国主义还在用战争威胁我们的时候，当我们的领土台湾还在美国侵略者占领之下的时候，我们还是不能不加强国防力量，来应付突发的事变，来粉碎任何侵略者的挑衅。国家预算支出充分显示了国家对人民福利的关怀：今年全国职工的平均工资将提高14.5％；广大农民的生活，将由于国家从财政上支持农业的发展以及采取合理的税收政策和价格政策等措施，而得到显著的提高；手工业者和工商业者的生活，也将由于厂店改善经营管理、调整工资、解决医疗福利问题等等而随着改善和提高。在生产发展的基础上，不断提高人民的物质生活水平和文化生活水平，这是我们国家全部政策的出发点和归宿点，1956年的国家预算就生动地体现了这个原则。我以无限的喜悦反复读过了这个预算，我从许多数字后面看到了我们国家的美丽远景，我衷心拥护这个预算，愿为其胜利实现而奋斗。
    在这里，我想提出两点意见供参考。
    从去年起，在中共中央、毛主席和国务院的领导下，在全国范围内，开展了反对和批判右倾保守思想的斗争。这一斗争取得了辉煌的成果，使我们国家的政治形势发生了深刻的、根本的变化，社会主义已经取得了决定性的胜利。但是，也应该看到，和反对右倾保守思想的同时，在某些地区、某些部门也出现了急躁冒进倾向。例如，农业生产合作社生产计划的偏高和不够全面，农业生产的单打一和忽视副业经营，新式农具和优良品种的盲目推广，扫盲工作中的好大喜功，轻工业生产中的忽视质量规格，等等。所有这些盲目冒进的倾向都是和反右倾保守思想的正确要求不相符合的。反右倾保守，是反对那种安于现状的思想，在这种思想指导之下，人们趦趄不前，畏首畏尾，束手缚脚，把应该办而且能够办的事情搁下来不办，应该快些办而且能够快些办的事情缓缓地办。毫无疑问，这种现象是应该反对的，不反对右倾保守思想，我们的各项工作就将如蜗牛行步，不能前进，就要犯大错误。急躁冒进则是超越客观可能的倾向，是不顾客观条件、不从实际出发的主观主义倾向，其结果自然也会招致损失，在某些情况下还要导致强迫命令、脱离群众的恶果。因此，即使这种倾向只是存在于某些地区和某些部门，即使这种倾向还只是萌芽状态，我们都应该强调指出来，大力克服它。这种急躁冒进的倾向，在某些高级机关固然有；但，由于下面各级机关将任务层层加重，把完成任务的期限层层缩短提前，所以显得较严重一些。下面有不少的干部，在社会主义革命的高潮中，政治热情和积极性很高，他们怀着善良的愿望，主观上想为群众多办点事情，但缺乏实事求是的工作作风，思想方法片面，所以百废俱兴，齐头并进，其结果就产生了急躁冒进的倾向。我想，领导者的责任，一方面应该具体地、有分析地检查自己所领导的单位是不是有急躁冒进倾向，如果有，它的程度怎样？对下面产生了什么影响？如何克服？另一方面，应该向下级机关和干部进行说服教育，说明过与不及都是不对的道理，让大家懂得，应该开展两条路线的斗争，既要反对保守主义，也要反对急躁冒进。必须认识：思想方法的问题，是一个必须在较长时间内在实际斗争中不断学习、不断提高始能求得解决的问题。如果不进行具体分析，不进行说服教育，一声喊：反对急躁冒进！就会把问题扩大化，导致另一个极端。而这种泼凉水的办法，只能使下面的干部感觉：昨天右了，今天“左”了，一无是处，无所措手足。——而这是会造成很大损失的。
    李先念副总理在报告中提到：“除了在本年国家预算中已经适当地增大地方预算的增长率，照顾地方的需要以外，还准备适当地扩大地方在财政管理上的权限和机动性，使地方在预算总额的控制数字以内，能够根据当地实际情况安排自己的收支。”报告还指出：“正确的办法，是使中央的统一领导、统一计划的原则，同地方的分级负责、因地制宜的原则结合起来。”中央与地方的分权，最重要的标志是财政管理上的权限和机动性。1956年国家预算开始注意到这点，不久还要提出具体办法作系统的规定，我认为这是正确的，我们的国家幅员很大，各地区的自然条件、人口密度、民族情况、经济基础、物质资源、事业发展情况、国家重点建设的分布条件等等方面，都有着千差万别。不注意到各地区的特点和差别，中央管得过多、过紧、过细，就很难发挥地方的积极性，许多应兴办的、可以办的事项，地方就将感觉手长袖短，无能为力。反分散主义是对的，反本位主义、地方主义也是对的，但发挥地方的积极性，调动地方的积极力量来支持中央，支持全国的建设事业，同样也是对的。
    各位代表：我们的国家如日初升，欣欣向荣；我们人民内部的团结一天比一天增进和巩固；我们的会议一次比一次开得好，日益显示出我们国家制度的青春的旺盛的生命力。为了社会主义，让我们团结全国各族人民，进行紧张的努力，胜利地实现1956年的国家预算，胜利地完成1956年国家经济建设的年度计划，胜利地提前和超额完成第一个五年计划。
