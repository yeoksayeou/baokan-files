    亚非学生会议的会期将延长
    新华社万隆2日电　据安塔拉通讯社今天报道，亚非学生会议将要开到六月七日，而不是像早先预定的那样开到六月四日。
    同时，资格审查委员会审查各代表的证书的工作已经有了进展。到目前为止，已经批准二十五个代表团可以参加这次会议。只有印度和巴基斯坦代表团的资格尚未决定。
    根据计划，会议将于今日下午本地时间十五点举行一次全体会议。
    同时，印度尼西亚学生代表团要求资格审查委员会继续它的工作，并且尽可能早地完成工作。它还建议，万一资格审查委员会不能在今天完成它的工作，全体会议还是要在国际筹备委员会的主持下开会。这样做的目的在于使各代表有发表他们对于会议的看法和意见的机会。
    会议的议程迄今尚未决定。
    新华社万隆2日电　中国学生代表团在一日同日本代表团举行了友谊晚会。
    在这前一天晚上，中国学生代表们同印度代表们举行了晚会。中国代表团在晚会上把纪念品赠送给印度代表团团长。在同一天晚上，中国代表们同巴基斯坦的学生代表们共进晚餐。
