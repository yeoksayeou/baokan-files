Yunnan Opera "Niu Gao Tears Up the Edict" and Others
    Yi Bing

    After the Yunnan Provincial Dian Opera Troupe arrived in Beijing, they premiered three traditional Dian Opera pieces: "Borrowing a Relative for a Match," "Lotus Flower Match," and "Niu Gao Tears Up the Edict." "Borrowing a Relative for a Match" exposes the barbarity of the feudal era's marriage-for-sale system, and praises Wang Guiying's bold and resourceful struggle to break free from her unfortunate fate and pursue an ideal partner. The vivid and moving image of Wang Guiying in the play won the audience's praise. "Lotus Flower Match" is adapted from "Lotus Flower Third Daughter" in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio." The script and performance have been reorganized, especially in the artistic treatment, where many bold attempts have been made. Dian Opera's music, which excels at lyricism, and its beautiful dances vividly depict the love between Lotus Flower Third Daughter and Du Juncai, to a certain extent embodying Pu Songling's good and magnificent fantasies about real life in the original work.

    Particularly exciting is the play "Niu Gao Tears Up the Edict," a refined one-act play. In terms of performance, it shows the Dian Opera's simple and elegant artistic style and outstanding realistic tradition. It describes how Zhao Gou and Qin Hui, the monarch and his minister, unjustly framed the national hero Yue Fei and his son. Because the Southern Song Dynasty court destroyed its own Great Wall, it led to a large-scale invasion by the Jin army. At this time, Yue Fei's general Niu Gao was forced to become an outlaw in the Taihang Mountains. He recruited soldiers and horses, determined to kill his way to Lin'an to avenge the Yue family. Zhao Gou, in a moment of crisis, thought of Niu Gao, and he sent Lu Wenliang to the Taihang Mountains to order Niu Gao to send troops to fight the enemy. The dramatic conflict thus unfolds fiercely.

    Niu Gao received a report from his son Niu Tong, saying that an official in a red robe was heading straight for the Taihang Mountains. This directly pushed the character to the forefront of the conflict, arousing his uncontrollable emotional excitement. He sang angrily, "Who has the guts to defy heaven, daring to send an official to Taihang?" Then he ordered Niu Tong to immediately find out the identity of the visitor. If it was sent by the Jin Dynasty, he should be bound and escorted up the mountain. If it was sent by the Song King, he should be brought up the mountain with a yellow flag covering his face and a red flag leading the way.

    In this short play, the distinct characteristics of this old hero's thoughts and feelings, and his mental state, filled with concern for national affairs, are excellently portrayed. He is a heroic figure tempered in the ethnic war. He persisted in the anti-Jin position after Yue Fei was murdered, and he had an irreconcilable feud with Zhao Gou, Qin Hui, and other surrender factions; this put him in a situation where he was attacked by both the Jin Dynasty and the Southern Song Dynasty. He must be vigilant against attacks from all sides. He is also a brave general in the invincible Yue Family Army, and he has unshakable confidence in the justice of his actions and his bravery in battle. His strong patriotism, heroic and unyielding character, all of these are clearly embodied through vigorous and profound singing, personalized language, and heroic and fierce movements.

    When he learned that the visitor was an envoy sent by the Song King, because of deep hatred and vigilance, he ordered his subordinates to draw their bows, unsheathe their knives, and set up a battle formation. He sternly refused to read the Song King's "imperial edict" and forbade anyone to speak on behalf of the Song King. But when Lu Wenliang said his name and mentioned his brotherhood with Niu Gao in those years, Niu Gao greeted him cordially and sat down. Lu Wenliang then complained that the Jin army had invaded and the country was in crisis, and Niu Gao's blood immediately boiled. He couldn't wait to rush to the battlefield and kill all the enemies. But when it was mentioned that the Song King ordered him to send troops to fight the enemy, his deep hatred for Zhao Gou and Qin Hui aroused the deepest contradictions in his heart. As the plot developed to Lu Wenliang "Song King this, Song King that" eloquently defending Zhao Gou, Niu Gao could no longer suppress the anger in his heart. He angrily ordered his son to remove Lu Wenliang's seat.

    Lu Wenliang desperately continued to say many good things for Zhao Gou, saying how Zhao Gou hated treacherous ministers, regretted his past mistakes, and how he missed Yue Fei, etc., trying to persuade Niu Gao with this. Then he took out the "imperial edict." In his rage, Niu Gao seized it and tore it to shreds. In this stalemate, Lu Wenliang suddenly remembered the letter that Madam Yue had asked him to bring to Niu Gao, so he mentioned that he had passed by Yue's Village on the way. The three words "Yue's Village" had an extraordinary magic for this stubborn hero. Niu Gao then asked his son to bring a seat, asked Lu Wenliang to sit down and talk in detail, and listened attentively to Lu Wenliang's words:

    Madam Yue sends her regards with care,
    Where are you going dressed like this?
    Brother said that Jin Wushu has invaded again,
    Going to Taihang to move rescuers.
    Madam Yue heard this and tears rolled down,
    Before leaving, she wrote a letter and ordered brother to present it.

    This aria moved Niu Gao and also held the audience's heartstrings, pushing the drama to a climax.

    Niu Gao held the letter with trembling hands and asked Lu Wenliang to wait in the back hall. He arranged incense burners, knelt piously, and after shedding tears, recited Madam Yue's letter:

    "It's all because Jin Wushu has once again invaded the border, and the people of the Central Plains are suffering deeply. Your elder brother is loyal to the country and obeys his mother's instructions. If the Jin army is not destroyed, he cannot rest his eyes. Dear brother, be sure to send troops quickly, not for the Song King, but for the people."

    As the aria says: "Madam Yue's words are very righteous, Old Niu Gao has to temporarily endure the hatred in his heart." So he invited Lu Wenliang out and presented him with three conditions: First, generals outside may disobey the emperor's orders; second, acquit the Yue family; and third, kill Qin Hui to avenge Yue Fei. After Lu Wenliang accepted these conditions, Niu Gao agreed to send troops to fight the Jin.

    This play, with outstanding artistic techniques, initially arranges the characters in a typical environment that immediately drives them to action, arranged at the forefront of the conflict; it begins with the characters' most agitated thoughts and emotions, and depicts the characters' rapidly changing mental state reasonably. It thus reveals all aspects of the character, shaping Niu Gao's heroic, rough, upright, enthusiastic, and innocent heroic character. It also shapes Lu Wenliang's character of running around for the country, not hesitating to endure hardships, and seeking perfection. Through them, it also shows Madam Yue's noble spirit. The reason why this play is worthy of praise is not only in the artistic depiction and the excellent performance of the actors, but especially pleasing is that it shows the shocking power of thought and morality through vivid artistic images, the noble virtues embodied in the people's hero Niu Gao.

    Dian Opera is a bright camellia in our motherland's borderland. The Yunnan Provincial Dian Opera Troupe has brought us excellent plays like "Niu Gao Tears Up the Edict," as well as admirable plays such as "Smashing the Melon to Recruit a Son-in-Law," "Sending Jingniang," "Storming the Palace," "Beating Dao Ling," and "Torturing and Descending the Mountain." During its performance in the capital, it will surely arouse people's strong interest in Dian Opera art and cheer for these opera workers from the borderland.

    滇剧“牛皋扯旨”及其他
    伊兵
    云南省滇剧团到北京后，首次演出了“借亲配”、“荷花配”、“牛皋扯旨”三个滇剧的传统剧目。“借亲配”揭露了封建时代买卖婚姻制度的野蛮性质，赞扬王桂英摆脱不幸命运，追求理想配偶的大胆而又机智的斗争。戏里王桂英个性鲜明的动人形象，博得了观众的好评。“荷花配”是根据“聊斋志异”中的“荷花三娘子”改编而成的，剧本和表演都经过了整理，特别是在艺术处理上作了不少大胆的尝试，滇剧的长于抒情的音乐和美妙的舞蹈、色彩鲜明地描绘了荷花三娘子和杜君才的爱情，一定程度地体现了蒲留仙在原作里所寄托的对现实人生善良和瑰丽的幻想。
    特别令人兴奋的是“牛皋扯旨”一剧，这是一出精致的独幕剧。在表演上，它显示了滇剧纯朴典雅的艺术风格和卓越的现实主义传统。它描写赵构、秦桧君臣屈害了民族英雄岳飞父子之后，由于南宋小朝庭自毁长城，招致了金兵的大举入侵。这时岳飞部将牛皋被逼上太行山落草，他招兵买马，立志杀上临安为岳家报仇。赵构在危急中想到了牛皋，他派陆文亮到太行山要牛皋出兵杀敌。戏剧的矛盾冲突就此激烈地展开。
    牛皋得到他儿子牛通的报告，说是有一个穿红袍的官长直奔太行山而来，这就开门见山地把这个人物推向了矛盾的尖端，引起了他感情上不可遏制的激动。他十分恼怒地唱出“是何人吃了天雷胆，敢派差官到太行”。随后他吩咐牛通立即查明来人的身份，如果是金邦派来的，那就绳捆索绑押上山来，如果是宋王派来的，就把他黄旗遮面，红旗引道带上山来。
    在这短短的一段戏中，出色地刻划了对国事满怀忧忿的这位老英雄思想感情上、精神状态上的鲜明特征。他是在民族战争中锻炼出来的英雄人物，他在岳飞被害后坚持了抗金的阵地，而他和赵构秦桧之类的投降派又有着不共戴天之仇；这就使他处于金邦、南宋两面受敌的环境中，他必须警惕来自任何方面的攻击。他又是无敌的岳家军中的骁将，他对自己行为的正义性和勇敢善战具有不可动摇的信心。他强烈的爱国主义精神，豪迈和刚烈的性格，所有这些，透过苍劲沉郁的唱腔，个性化的语言、豪迈激烈的身段动作，鲜明地体现了出来。
    等到他得知来人是宋王派来的使臣，由于深刻的仇恨和警惕，他命令部将弓上弦刀出鞘摆开了阵势。他严峻地拒绝宣读宋王的“圣旨”，不许为宋王下说词。但当陆文亮说出自己的姓名，提起他和牛皋当年结拜之情，牛皋就和颜悦色地下座相迎。陆文亮又诉说金兵犯境国事危急，牛皋的热血立即沸腾起来，他恨不得立即奔上战场，杀尽敌人。但当提到宋王命他出兵杀敌，由于他和赵构秦桧的深仇，在他心头激起了最深刻的矛盾。剧情发展到陆文亮“左一个宋王，右一个宋王”为赵构滔滔不绝地辩护，这时，牛皋再也按捺不住心头的怒火，他忿怒地叫儿子撤去陆文亮的坐位。
    陆文亮不顾一切地继续替赵构说了许多好话，说赵构如何痛恨佞臣，痛悔前非，如何怀念岳飞等等，企图以此说动牛皋，随后他拿出了“圣旨”。牛皋盛怒之下，把它夺来扯得粉碎。在这僵持的局面下，陆文亮忽然想起了岳夫人托他带给牛皋的书信，因此他提起了来时路过岳家村的事。岳家村三个字对这位倔强的英雄具有异常的魔力，牛皋便又叫他儿子搬来坐位，请陆文亮坐下细谈，亲切地全神贯注地倾听着陆文亮的话：
    岳夫人把小弟殷勤动问
    这样打扮何处行？
    弟说到金兀术又犯国境
    要去太行搬救兵。
    岳夫人闻此言珠泪滚滚，
    临行时她修书命弟转呈。
    这段唱词激动了牛皋，同时也紧扣着观众的心弦，把戏剧推向了高潮。
    牛皋用打颤的双手捧着书信，请陆文亮后堂稍待。他陈列香案，虔诚地跪拜之后，挥泪诵读岳夫人的来信：
      “都只为金兀术又兴兵犯境，中原百姓火热水深苦难忍，你大哥精忠报国遵母训，金兵不灭他目难瞑。贤弟千万快出兵，不为宋王为黎民。”
    诚如唱词中说的：“岳夫人说的话大义分明，老牛皋只得暂忍心头恨。”于是他请出了陆文亮，向他提出了三个条件，一、将在外君命有所不受，二、赦岳家无罪，三、杀秦桧为岳飞报仇。陆文亮接受了这些条件后，牛皋也就同意出兵抗金。
    这出戏以杰出的艺术手法，一开始就把人物安排在立即驱使他们行动起来的典型环境之中，安排在矛盾冲突的最尖端；从人物思想情绪最激动的地方落笔，入情入理地描绘了人物瞬息万变的精神状态。从而揭示了性格的各个方面，因此塑造了牛皋豪迈，粗犷、正直、热情和天真的英雄性格。也塑造了为国奔走、不辞艰险、委屈求全的陆文亮的性格。透过他们，还显示了岳夫人大义昭然的气质。这出戏之所以值得赞扬，不仅在艺术描写上、演员的优秀表演上，特别令人喜欢的是它通过了生动的艺术形象，显示出震动人心的思想和道德的力量，那种体现在人民英雄牛皋身上的崇高美德。
    滇剧是我们祖国边疆的一朵浓艳的山茶花。云南省滇剧团为我们带来了像“牛皋扯旨”那样的优秀剧目，还带来了“打瓜招亲”、“送京娘”、“闯宫”、“打道灵”，“拷火下山”等使人赞赏的好戏。它在首都公演期间，必将引起人们对滇剧艺术强烈的兴趣，为这些来自边疆的戏曲工作者欢呼。
