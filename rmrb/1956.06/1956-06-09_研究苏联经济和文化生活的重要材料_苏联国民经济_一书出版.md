Moscow, June 8th (By our correspondent) A book of immense value for studying the Soviet economy, "The National Economy of the USSR," has been published. This book collects rich data on the past and present of the Soviet national economy and cultural life.

The book begins with the population statistics of the entire Soviet Union. As of April 1956, the Soviet population totaled 200.2 million, second only to China and India, ranking third in the world. The book explains that national industrialization has brought about significant changes in the ratio of industrial and agricultural populations. For example, in 1926, only 26.3 million people lived in cities, accounting for 17.9% of the total Soviet population; while in early 1956, the urban population had increased to 87 million, accounting for 43.4% of the total population.

The book also introduces changes in the class composition of the Soviet population and the distribution of labor in productive and non-productive institutions. According to statistics, 85.2% of all workers are currently employed in the production sector, and only 14.8% are employed in non-productive sectors such as education, healthcare, and state organs.

The achievements of socialist industry are also elaborated in the book. In 1955, the total output value of all industrial products was 27 times that of 1913, of which the output value of large-scale industry was 39 times that of 1913. Soviet power, as the foundation of technological progress, is developing rapidly. The total power generation capacity of steam, gas, and hydraulic turbines manufactured in 1940 was 1.18 million kilowatts, while in 1955 it reached 5,551,000 kilowatts, an increase of more than four times.

In this book, one can see the rapid growth of Soviet labor productivity, which is now 5.8 times that of 1928.

The figures for agricultural development illustrate that the total sown area during the Fifth Five-Year Plan increased by almost 40 million hectares compared to the past, of which 20.5 million hectares were cultivated virgin and fallow lands. The grain sown area increased to 23.5 million hectares during this period, of which 18.5 million hectares were planted on cultivated virgin lands.

Regarding the situation of Soviet investment in capital construction, the book states: In the eleven years after the establishment of the Soviet regime, 15.7 billion rubles were invested in capital construction, while in the Fifth Five-Year Plan alone, it was 625.3 billion rubles. From 1929 to 1955, more than 29,000 large industrial enterprises, more than 5,000 state farms, 9,000 machine tractor stations, more than 89,000 kilometers of railways, 75,600 schools, approximately 430 million square meters of housing, and many hospitals, childcare facilities, etc., were newly built or renovated.

Cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings have also greatly developed. This year, more than 50 million people are studying in various schools. In 1955, the number of students studying in higher education institutions was almost fourteen times more than in 1914. In particular, the cultivation of scientific talent has grown rapidly.

    研究苏联经济和文化生活的重要材料
    “苏联国民经济”一书出版
    本报莫斯科8日电　对于研究苏联经济有巨大价值的“苏联国民经济”一书已经出版。这本书收集了苏联国民经济和文化生活的过去和现在的丰富资料。
    书的开头发表了苏联全国的人口统计数字。1956年4月苏联人口共二亿零二十万人，仅次于中国和印度，占世界第三位。书中说明，国家工业化使工业和农业人口的对比发生了很大的变化。如1926年在城市居住的仅有二千六百三十万人，即占全苏联人口的17.9％；而在1956年初城市人口增至八千七百万，即占全部人口的43.4％。
    书中也介绍了苏联人口阶级成份构成的变化，以及劳动力在生产与非生产机构中的分布情况。据统计，目前在全部工作者中间，85.2％是在生产部门工作的，只有14.8％是在教育、保健及国家机关等非生产部门中工作。
    关于社会主义工业的成就在书中也有阐述。1955年全部工业品总产量是1913年的二十七倍，其中大工业产量是1913年的三十九倍。作为技术进步的基础的苏联动力在迅速的发展。1940年制造的蒸汽、瓦斯和水力的涡轮机的总发电能力是118万瓩，而在1955年则达到5，551，000瓩，增加为四倍多。
    在这本书里可以看到苏联劳动生产率的迅速增长。现在已经是1928年的五点八倍。
    农业发展的数字说明：全部播种面积在第五个五年计划期间几乎比过去增加了四千万公顷，其中二千零五十万公顷是被开垦的生荒地和熟荒地。谷物播种面积在这个期间增长到二千三百五十万公顷，其中一千八百五十万公顷是在被开垦的荒地上种植的。
    关于苏联在投资于基本建设方面的情形，这本书里写道：苏维埃政权建立以后的十一年间投入基本建设是一百五十七亿卢布，而在第五个五年计划中已是六千二百五十三亿卢布。在1929年到1955年中新建和修建了两万九千多个大工业企业，五千多个国营农庄，九千个机器拖拉机站，八万九千多公里铁路线，七万五千六百所学校，约四亿三千万平方公尺住宅，许多医院、幼儿机关等等。
    文教科学事业也有了很大发展，今年共有五千多万人在各种学校里读书，1955年高等学校学习的学生几将比1914年多十四倍。特别是科学人材的培养有了迅速的增长。
