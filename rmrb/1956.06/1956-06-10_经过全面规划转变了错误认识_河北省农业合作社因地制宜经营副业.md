Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 9th. Most agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province, after comprehensive planning, have rapidly expanded their sideline production in accordance with local conditions.

The Tianjin area is close to the sea, rivers, and cities. Based on these conditions, agricultural cooperatives and their members are currently engaged in more than 50 kinds of sideline businesses, such as fishing, mat weaving, transportation, pig farming, chicken farming, and agricultural product processing, involving approximately 240,000 people. In Jin County and Jingxing County of Shijiazhuang area, based on the conditions of being close to railways, cities, and mining areas, agricultural cooperatives organized four groups of more than 500 laborers, more than 3,000 livestock, and more than 400 carts for transportation. The Xingtai area has less mountainous land. Even after land processing and the development of forestry and animal husbandry production, there is still a surplus of labor. After comprehensive agricultural and sideline planning, more than 16,000 laborers were also sent out to work.

Before carrying out comprehensive planning for agricultural and sideline production, many agricultural cooperatives in this province believed that with the realization of advanced cooperativization, agricultural production would greatly develop, and there would be no surplus labor to engage in sideline production. Only after the local Party and government leading organs helped them to specifically calculate the accounts, this erroneous perception was transformed. According to key investigations by the CPC Tianjin Prefectural Committee in Baodi and Renqiu counties, even during the busy farming season, 20% to 30% of female laborers and male semi-laborers had nothing to do if sideline production was not developed. Based on this situation, the rural work cadres of this area helped agricultural cooperatives to make comprehensive plans and rationally arrange labor. In this way, not only was sideline production restored and developed, and spring plowing and sowing completed in a timely manner, but also 160,000 laborers were drawn out to complete more than 20 huge irrigation, drainage, and land improvement projects to transform more than 4 million mu of low-lying land. In Quzhou County in the Handan cotton-growing area, 24 agricultural cooperatives originally believed that cotton planting was labor-intensive and there was no time for sideline production. After comprehensive planning, more than 1,300 people were also drawn out to engage in sideline production during sowing and thinning.

Comprehensive planning has also overcome the tendency of some cadres and members to only engage in large-scale sideline businesses and not in small-scale sideline businesses. When sixteen cooperatives in Yongqing County were formulating comprehensive plans, they emphasized finding production opportunities for women and elderly and weak laborers. After the planning, they increased 2,900 pigs, more than 600 sheep, and more than 5,000 chickens. They also planned to develop decentralized small-scale sideline production such as beekeeping, rabbit raising, silkworm breeding, mat weaving, and saltpeter boiling. Agricultural cooperatives in the Tianjin and Zhangjiakou areas vigorously mobilized members to raise pigs, and in five months, the number of pigs increased by more than 200,000.

### 经过全面规划转变了错误认识  河北省农业合作社因地制宜经营副业

    经过全面规划转变了错误认识
    河北省农业合作社因地制宜经营副业
    新华社保定9日电　河北省多数农业生产合作社经过全面规划以后，副业生产已经因地制宜地迅速地展开起来。
    天津专区靠近海、河、城市，根据这些条件，当前农业社和社员已经经营起打鱼、编席、运输、养猪、养鸡和农产品加工等五十多种副业，从事副业的约有二十四万多人。石家庄专区晋县、井陉等四县的农业社，根据靠近铁路城市和矿区的条件，组织起四个五百多名劳力、三千多头牲口和四百多辆大车搞运输。邢台专区山区土地较少，进行土地加工和发展林牧业生产后劳力仍有富余，经过农副业全面规划，也抽出了一万六千多名劳力外出做工。
    这个省许多农业社在进行农副业生产全面规划以前，曾认为实现了高级合作化农业生产大发展，就没有富余劳力从事副业生产了，经过各地党政领导机关帮助它们具体算账，这种错误认识才转变过来。据中共天津地委在宝坻、任丘等县的重点调查，如果副业生产不开展，就是在农忙期间，也有20％到30％的女劳力和男半劳力没事作。根据这种情况，这个专区的农村工作干部帮助农业社作了全面规划，合理地安排了劳动力，这样，不仅恢复发展了副业生产，适时地完成了春耕播种，并且还抽出十六万名劳力、完成了改造四百多万亩洼地的二十多项巨大的灌溉排水和整地工程。邯郸棉区曲周县有二十四个农业社，原来认为植棉费工，没空搞副业，经过全面规划，在播种间苗当中，也抽出了一千三百多人从事副业生产。
    全面规划还克服了有些干部社员只愿搞大宗副业不愿搞零星副业的偏向。永清县十六个社在订全面规划的时候，强调给妇女和老弱劳力找生产门路，规划后就增加了两千九百头猪，六百多只羊和五千多只鸡。并且还计划开展养蜂、喂兔和养蚕、织席、熬硝等分散的零星副业生产。天津、张家口专区的农业社，大力发动社员养猪，五个月来即增猪二十多万头。
