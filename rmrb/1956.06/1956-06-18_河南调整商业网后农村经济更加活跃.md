Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 17th. After Henan Province adjusted its commercial network, the rural economy became more active. From April to early June, the retail sales of production and daily necessities by grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions increased by 62.2% compared with the same period last year; the sales volume of sales agencies and sales teams composed of rural small traders and peddlers also increased significantly. During this period, farmers also sold more than 30 million yuan worth of local and sideline products on the spot.

In the past, commodities in Henan's rural areas were considered "slow-moving," but now sales channels have been opened up. Medicinal materials produced in some counties of Anyang and Xinxiang prefectures, as well as strips, reed mats, brooms, and straw ropes woven by farmers, were often overstocked in the past. Now, new commercial institutions are spread throughout the countryside, and a large number of employees frequently go deep to understand the needs of farmers in various regions, and promote material exchanges between regions, making up for each other's deficiencies. These local and sideline products have become bestsellers. In mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, the supply and marketing cooperative system purchases waste cotton batting, leather shoe soles, and miscellaneous bones and other waste materials from farmers. By using methods such as on-site processing and on-site promotion, business has expanded several times.

Now, with the support and assistance of commercial departments such as rural supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have universally developed diversified operations based on the principle of agriculture as the main business and diversified economy. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Xuchang Prefecture have supplied more than 250,000 yuan worth of raw materials for sideline production such as iron, vitex, and reeds to various agricultural cooperatives for processing and production. In the past three months, the sideline income of Xujiagou Agricultural Cooperative in Anyang County has reached 28,000 yuan, with an average increase of 22 yuan per member.

    河南调整商业网后农村经济更加活跃
    新华社郑州17日电　河南省经过调整商业网以后，农村经济更加活跃。从四月份到六月上旬，各地基层供销合作社的生产、生活资料零售额，比去年同期上升62.2％；由农村小商小贩组成的代销店和代销小组的销货量，也大大增加了。在这个时期，农民们还就地出售了价值三千多万元的土、副产品。
    河南农村过去曾经被认为是“滞销”的商品，现在已经打开了销路。安阳、新乡专区部分县出产的药材，以及农民编制的条货、苇席、扫帚和草绳等，过去常年积压，现在，新的商业机构遍布了农村，大批从业人员经常深入了解各个地区农民的需要，并且通过开展地区与地区之间的物资交流，互通有无，这些土、副产品都变成畅销货了。在交通不大方便的山区，供销合作社系统收购农民的废棉套、皮鞋底和杂骨等废杂零物，运用就地加工，就地推销等办法，把业务扩大了好几倍。
    现在，各地农业生产合作社在农村供销合作社等商业部门的支持和帮助之下，根据以农业为主经营多种经济的方针，普遍开展了多种经营。许昌专区的供销合作社，已经把总值二十五万元以上的铁、荆条和苇子等副业生产原料，供应到各个农业社进行加工生产。安阳县许家沟农业社近三个月的副业收入，已经有二万八千元，平均每个社员增加收入二十二元。
