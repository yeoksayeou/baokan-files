    Farmers' Income from Selling Cocoons Increases Compared to Last Year
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou) Zhejiang's silkworm cocoon purchasing work has entered its peak season. The 332 cocoon purchasing stations set up in silkworm farming areas have already purchased more than 273,800 dan of silkworm cocoons. The quality of the purchased silkworm cocoons is generally very good.
    This year, Zhejiang Province promoted the rapid silkworm raising method, and the unit yield of cocoons has generally increased. On average, each silkworm egg card can produce 55.58 jin of cocoons, an increase of more than three jin compared to last year. The highest yield was in the Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative of Yangcun Township, Fenghua County, where eight silkworm egg cards produced an average of 91.5 jin of cocoons per card. This year, the state's purchase price of cocoons has increased by more than 10% compared to last year. Farmers throughout the province engaged in silkworm farming have earned more than 33.5 million yuan from selling spring silkworm cocoons alone, an increase of more than 8 million yuan compared to the income from silkworm cocoons during the same period last year.
