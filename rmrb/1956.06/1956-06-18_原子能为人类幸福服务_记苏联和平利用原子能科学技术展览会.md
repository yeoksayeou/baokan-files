    Atomic Energy Serves Human Happiness
    —A Record of the Soviet Exhibition of Scientific and Technological Achievements in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
    Cai Jianyuan
    Walking into the Soviet Exhibition of Scientific and Technological Achievements in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy, one immediately feels that human wisdom has achieved a tremendous victory in the struggle to conquer nature. Soviet scientists are striving to enable mankind to enjoy the fruits of this victory and make human life happier.
    The introductory hall of the exhibition first tells people that all chemical elements that make up living and non-living things are composed of atoms. At the center of the atom of any chemical element is an atomic nucleus. Inside this invisible atomic nucleus lies a huge amount of energy. Eleven years ago, American imperialists opened it up, causing unprecedented disasters to the vast populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan; now Soviet scientists are opening it up to seek happiness for mankind. From a series of diagrams here, one can learn about the structure and properties of atomic nuclei. The atomic nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium, thorium, and radium can spontaneously decay, producing radiation. After research by scientists, atomic nuclei can also be artificially altered to create radioactive isotopes, which can be widely used to serve human happiness. Four large photographs tell people that the Soviet Union's peaceful use of atomic energy has already been specifically planned in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Soviet artificial radioactive isotopes have been widely used to seek happiness for the Soviet people. Not only that, but a large map here shows that Beijing, Berlin, Sofia, Warsaw, Budapest, Bucharest, Hanoi, Prague, and other places have also frequently received artificial radioactive isotopes.
    Over a hundred pieces of dazzling uranium ore and minerals are displayed in two large glass cabinets in the second part of the exhibition, all from the Soviet Union, some of which are the latest discoveries. For the practical use of atomic energy, it is necessary to build nuclear reactors, and the basic substance for obtaining energy from nuclear reactors is radioactive uranium. The required radioactive uranium can be extracted from these colorful uranium ores and minerals. Soviet scientists have made many efforts to find uranium mines, using many methods, from walking to using cars and aviation. Various methods and related instruments are introduced here. An aircraft equipped with a set of radiation measuring instruments flies to vast mountainous areas, very low to the ground. If underground minerals emit gamma rays, the instruments on the aircraft will immediately react and automatically record the intensity of those gamma rays. Scientists can find uranium mines based on the intensity of the gamma rays. A small darkroom resembling a camera is placed here, equipped with a fluorescent screen. Placing the mined uranium ore in this darkroom, people can understand its situation from the light it emits. A series of methods for studying uranium ore are introduced here.
    The atomic energy power station of the Soviet Academy of Sciences stands tall in the dense forest. In the third part of the exhibition, you can see a model of this power station. It began generating electricity on June 27, 1954, and has been working smoothly ever since. The model of the power unit of this power station—the nuclear reactor—is one-fortieth of the actual size. Although it is very complex, every part can be clearly seen. A boiler with the same capacity needs 100 tons of coal every day, but it only needs 30 grams of uranium per day. Here, people can also see the diagrams of large-capacity atomic energy power stations with capacities of 200,000 and 400,000 kilowatts, which will be built according to the provisions of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan. Models of nuclear reactors with power ratings of 2,000 kilowatts and 6,500 kilowatts are also displayed here. These two reactors are for experimental use only.
    Achievements in the study of atomic nuclei have opened up some new disciplines and research paths in chemistry. The fourth part of the exhibition introduces this aspect. "Radiation chemistry" is a very important and new science in this field. It studies the effects of radiation on matter, which is not only closely related to the structural materials of nuclear reactors, but also of paramount importance to how to fully utilize radiation. For example, refining gasoline from crude oil is generally more complicated, but now using a device containing radioactive cobalt becomes very simple. The study of manufacturing the pesticide 666 has been greatly facilitated by the application of radioactive isotope rays. There has also been great progress in analytical chemistry. For example, the total amount of rare earth elements contained in graphite, a material essential for nuclear reactors, must not exceed five parts per million. Such purity cannot be achieved using general analytical methods. Now, as long as the substance to be analyzed is placed in a nuclear reactor to make it radioactive, and then its type and intensity of radiation are distinguished, the amount of impurities it contains can be checked. This method can analyze impurities up to one part per hundred billion. The newly generated elements in nuclear reactors are generally very small in quantity, calculated in millionths of a gram. It is impossible to analyze them using general methods, but now the "ultra-micro analysis method" is available to solve this problem. The test tubes used in this analysis method are only the size of a pinhead and need to be carried out under a specially equipped microscope. It's like finding a total of one gram of impurities in the water of Kunming Lake. These methods are introduced here, and a series of wonderful instruments are displayed.
    Twelve bottles of wine rotate on a round plate. The plate is equipped with a counter, and the number on the counter jumps every time a bottle of wine passes. This is a counter used in industry. This counter contains a grain of millet-sized radioactive strontium, and whenever the wine bottle passes through and blocks the radiation, the number on it is automatically recorded. Such a grain of rice-sized radioactive strontium can be used continuously for decades. Things smaller than wine bottles or as large as a train can also be recorded using radioactive isotopes. The fifth part of the exhibition vividly introduces to people that Soviet scientists are pioneers in the application of atomic energy in industry. The study of the steel production process using radioactive isotopes is of particular significance. In open-hearth steelmaking, the application of radioactive isotopes can greatly shorten the smelting time and increase the productivity of the open-hearth furnace. For example, in blast furnace ironmaking, the understanding of the degree of damage to the furnace wall and furnace bottom could only rely on experience in the past. Now, installing equipment with radioactive cobalt can provide timely and accurate understanding.
    A child had a large hemangioma on the left cheek, which was so painful. After the doctor applied radioactive cobalt, it healed quickly, and the child became lively and lovely. The sixth part of the exhibition introduces the application of radioactive isotopes in medicine, citing various cases showing very good medical effects. For example, the use of radioactive isotopes to treat lower eyelid cancer is not only effective but also very simple. The radioactive isotopes used in medical treatment are mostly cobalt, phosphorus, and iodine. When using cobalt, different methods such as "application," "interstitial," or "gamma ray therapy machine" can be adopted. From the diagrams and instruments exhibited here, people can understand these methods. Two gamma ray therapy machines are the most eye-catching. One is close-range, which can treat skin tumors and other diseases; the other is long-range, which can treat cancers and other diseases. Both use radioactive cobalt. With long-range operation, patients and doctors must be separated in two rooms by a very thick wall, but doctors can talk to patients from a special microphone in the console. Radioactive isotopes also have many uses in diagnosis. The blood flow velocity in tissues when people suffer from arteriosclerosis, hypertension, and other diseases could not be measured before, but now it can be measured using radioactive isotopes. Radiation can indeed seek happiness for people, but if people engaged in radiation-related work do not pay attention to protection, they are extremely susceptible to its harm. Various protection methods and equipment are specially introduced here. Adding special thick walls, working at a distance, or shortening working hours are common methods. People can see that in order to prevent radioactive material from polluting, it is necessary to wear sealed protective clothing to work. Of course, people engaged in this work must not only protect themselves from harm, but also try to protect the people around them from harm.
    A pot of bright four-season begonias had fertilizer with radioactive phosphorus applied to it in the flowerpot two weeks ago. Using a counter to measure radioactive phosphorus in the living body of the plant against it, you can see that the flowers and tender parts have a lot of radiation, while the roots and aging parts have very little. A series of charts together with this pot of four-season begonias indicate that fertilizer location, fertilization depth, etc., are closely related to crop growth, soil moisture, etc., which can find the application method with the greatest fertilizer effect. From the last part of the exhibition, it can be seen that Soviet scientists are striving to widely study and apply radioactive isotopes in agriculture and biology. The metabolism of substances in plants, plant nutrition, and other situations can all be understood by using radioactive isotopes as "tracers." From the charts displayed here, you can see the effects of rays from radioactive uranium fission products on peas, broad beans, alfalfa, wheat, barley, etc. Most of them can increase production, but there are also bad effects, which need further research. Many interesting experiments on animals are also introduced here. Irradiating the cerebellum of chickens with radiation causes them to exhibit typical head-shaking when eating. Understanding this situation provides a more convenient method for people to study various processes in living organisms.
    Human happiness is above all else. This is the working principle of Soviet scientists, and it is also the working principle of all peace-loving people. After seeing this exhibition, a common belief arises in people's hearts: human life will be pushed to an extremely high stage.

    原子能为人类幸福服务
    ——记苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会
    蔡鉴远
    走进苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会，人们会立刻感到：人类的智慧在征服自然的斗争中获得了巨大的胜利。苏联的科学家正努力使人类享受这种胜利的果实，使人类的生活过得更幸福。
    展览会的序馆首先告诉人们，所有构成生物和非生物的化学元素，都是由原子组成的。任何化学元素的原子中央都有原子核。就在这肉眼不可见的原子核里，储藏着巨大的能量。十一年以前，美帝国主义者打开它使日本广岛、长崎的广大人民遭受到空前的灾害；现在苏联科学家打开它为人类谋取幸福。从这里的一系列图解，人们可以了解到原子核的构造和性质。重元素铀、钍、镭等的原子核能自发地蜕变，产生放射线。经过科学家们的研究，原子核还可以用人工改变，创造出放射性同位素，这都可以广泛地用于为人类幸福服务。四大幅照片告诉人们，苏联和平利用原子能，已经在第六个五年计划里作了具体规划。苏联的人造放射性同位素，已经广泛用于为苏联人民谋取幸福。不仅这样，这里有一幅大地图说明，北京、柏林、索非亚、华沙、布达佩斯、布加勒斯特、河内、布拉格等地，也已经经常得到人造放射性同位素。
    五光十色的铀的矿石和矿物陈列在展览会第二部分的两个大玻璃柜里，共计一百多块，它们都来自苏联，其中几种是苏联最新发现的。为了原子能的实际利用，需要建立原子核反应堆，原子核反应堆获得能量的基本物质是放射性铀。从这些多采的铀的矿石和矿物，就可以提取所需要的放射性铀。苏联的科学家们在寻找铀矿上作了许多努力，方法很多，由徒步到利用汽车和航空。这里介绍了各种方法和有关的仪器。飞机上装备一套测量放射线的仪器，飞到广大的山区去，离开地面很低。如果地下矿物中有丙种射线放出，飞机上的仪器立刻有反应，并且自动把那些丙种射线的强弱情况记录下来。科学家们根据丙种射线的强度，就可以找到铀矿。一个好像照相机似的小暗室摆在这里，里面装有萤光仪。把已经采掘到的铀矿放在这个暗室里，从它发出的光采，人们就可以了解它的情况。一系列的研究铀矿的方法，这里作了介绍。
    密密的森林里耸立着苏联科学院的原子能发电站。在展览会的第三部分，可以看到这个发电站的模型。它是1954年6月27日开始发电的，一直顺利地工作到现在。这个发电站的动力部分——原子核反应堆的模型，相当于实物的四十分之一，它虽然很复杂，但是每一部分都可以让人们看得清清楚楚。和它能力同样大的锅炉，每天需要一百吨煤，但是它每天只需要三十克铀。这里，人们同时可以看到二十万和四十万瓩的大功率原子能发电站的图解，它们将根据苏联第六个五年计划的规定被建立起来。功率为二千瓩和六千五百瓩的原子核反应堆的模型也陈列在这里，这两个反应堆是专供实验用的。
    研究原子核方面的成就，在化学方面开辟了一些新的学科和研究途径。展览会的第四部分介绍了这方面的情况。“辐射化学”是这方面很重要而且很新的一门科学。它研究放射线对物质的作用，不仅对原子核反应堆的结构材料有很密切的关系，对如何充分利用放射线也是头等重要的。如由原油提炼汽油，一般的方法比较复杂，现在采用含有放射性钴的装置，就变得很简单了。制造农药666的研究，由于应用放射性同位素的射线，大大地方便了。分析化学的进展也很大，如原子核反应堆必用的材料石墨，所含稀土元素的总量不容超过百万分之五，这样的纯度用一般的分析方法是做不到的。现在只要把所要分析的物质放在原子核反应堆里，使具有放射性，然后分辨它带了那一种放射线、强度如何等，就可以检查出它所含的杂质量。这种方法最高可以分析到千亿分之一克的杂质。在原子核反应堆里，新生成的元素，可是一般的量都很少，要用百万分之一克来计算，用一般的方法不可能对它进行分析，现在有了“超微量分析法”来解决。这种分析法所用的试管只有一个大头针大，需要在特装的显微镜下进行。好比昆明湖里的水，总共只有一克的杂质，也能把它找出来。这里介绍了这些方法，并陈列着一系列奇妙的仪器。
    十二瓶酒围在一个圆盘上旋转。圆盘上面装有记数器，每瓶酒经过的时候，记数器上的数字就跳动一下。这是一个工业上用的计数器。这个计数器里装有一粒小米大的放射性锶，每当酒瓶穿过挡住了放射线，它上面的数字就自动地作了记录。这样一粒米大的放射性锶，可以连续使用几十年。比酒瓶再小的东西或大如一列火车，也都可以应用放射性同位素记录它们。展览会的第五部分，生动地向人们介绍，苏联的科学家们是在工业上应用原子能的先行者。利用放射性同位素对钢的生产过程的研究，有着特别的意义。平炉炼钢，由于应用放射性同位素，就可以大大缩短冶炼时间，增加了平炉的生产率。又如高炉炼铁，对矿炉壁和炉底损坏程度的了解，以往只能凭经验，现在安上带放射性钴的装备，就可以及时、准确地进行了解。
    一个孩子左脸部长了大血管瘤，多么痛苦。医生给用放射性钴敷贴以后，很快痊愈了，孩子变得活泼可爱。展览会的第六部分介绍放射性同位素在医学方面的应用时，举出了各种各样显示医疗效果很好的病例。如使用放射性同位素治疗下眼睑癌，不仅效果好，而且很简便。在医疗上使用的放射性同位素，比较多的是钴、磷、碘。使用钴，可以采取“敷贴”、“间质”或“丙种射线治疗机”等不同方法。从这里展出的图解和仪器，人们可以了解这些方法。两台丙种射线治疗机最引人注意。一台是近距离的，可以治疗人体皮层瘤子和其他疾病；一台是远距离的，可以治疗癌瘤和其他疾病。两台都使用放射性钴。远距离操纵的，患者和医生必须由很厚的墙分隔在两间屋子里，但医生可以从操纵台里特备的传话器同患者谈话。放射性同位素在诊断上也有许多用途。人体患动脉硬化、高血压等病时组织内的血流速度，以前无法测量，现在可以使用放射性同位素测量了。放射线的确可以为人谋取幸福，可是从事有关放射线工作的人们如果不注意防护，极容易受到它的伤害。这里特别介绍了各种防护方法和用具。增加特制的厚墙、远距离工作或缩短工作时间，是常用的方法。人们可以看到，为了防止放射性物质污染，必须穿着密闭的防护衣进行工作。当然，从事这方面工作的人们不仅要防护自己不受伤害，而且要设法防护周围的人们不受伤害。
    一盆鲜艳的四季海棠，两个星期以前在花盆里施放了带有放射性磷的肥料。用测定植物活体内放射性磷的计数器对着它，可以看到花和幼嫩部分，放射线很多，根和衰老部分则很少。和这盆四季海棠一起的一系列图表标明，施肥位置、施肥深度等同作物生长、土壤水分等有密切关系，这就可以找出肥料效果最大的施用方法。从展览会的最后一部分可以看到，苏联的科学家们正努力在农业和生物学方面，广泛地研究应用放射性同位素。植物体中物质的新陈代谢作用、植物的营养等等情况，都可以用放射性同位素“示踪”而得到了解。从这里陈列的图表可以看到，放射性铀分裂产物的射线对于豌豆、蚕豆、苜蓿、小麦、大麦等所起的作用，大部分可以使增加产量，但也有得到不好的效果的，这就需要进一步作研究。这里还介绍了许多对动物的有趣的实验。用放射线照射鸡的小脑，鸡进食的时候就出现典型的头摇晃的现象。这种情况的了解，对于人们研究生物体内的各种作用过程提供了更方便的方法。
    人类幸福高于一切，这是苏联科学家们的工作原则，也是所有爱好和平的人们的工作原则。看完了这个展览会，人们心底产生一个共同的信念：人类生活将推向极高阶段。
