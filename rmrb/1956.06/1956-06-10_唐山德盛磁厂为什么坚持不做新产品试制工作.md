To the Editor:

    This January, the Tangshan Desheng Porcelain Factory accepted a batch of orders for export sanitary porcelain. These products required manufacturing according to new specifications, but the factory leaders were not proactive in carrying out trial production. In March, production of this item began. Because the workers were not skilled enough, it was difficult to shape the cast blanks, resulting in a semi-finished product breakage rate of over 80% in the first five days. Under these circumstances, the factory leaders still did not make up for the lack of trial production, but instead adopted methods such as increasing workers, increasing molds, and accelerating drying. As a result, although the quantity of products increased, the quality problems remained unresolved. In the first half of March alone, defective roller products for straight-tube toilet bowls accounted for more than 21%.
    This kind of thing has happened more than once at the Desheng Porcelain Factory. When the factory produced acid-resistant tiles last June, it was forced to stop production because it had not undergone trial production and appraisal beforehand; out of the 22,573 tiles produced, only 917 were good. This February, the factory accepted a batch of orders for acid-resistant magnetic rings, but also because it did not carry out trial production, it did not produce many qualified products after more than two months of production. The *Tangshan Labor Daily* has criticized the factory many times, but the factory has not even written a self-criticism. The factory's leaders should be made to publicly answer why they are unwilling to accept the lessons of their work and must insist on their mistakes?

    唐山德盛磁厂为什么坚持不做新产品试制工作编辑同志：
    今年一月份，唐山德盛磁厂接受了一批出口卫生磁的订货。这种产品需要按新的规格制造，但是工厂领导人却不积极进行试制工作。三月份，这项产品开始生产了。由于工人技术不熟练，结果使铸坯不易成型，在头五天里半成品的破损率就达到80％以上。在这种情况下，工厂领导人仍然不补做试制工作，而是采用了增加工人、增加模型和加速干燥等办法。这样，产品数量虽然增加了，质量问题仍然解决不了。在三月上半月，仅直管大便器的滚轴一项残品就占21％以上。
    这样的事情发生在德盛磁厂已经不止一次了。去年六月这个厂生产耐酸磁砖的时候，也是因为事先没有经过试制鉴定被迫停产；已经生产出来的22，573块磁砖中，只有917块好的。今年二月，这个厂接受了一批耐酸磁环的定货，也是因为不作试制工作，生产了两个多月没有出几个合格品。唐山劳动日报曾经对这个厂提出了多次批评，但是厂方连个检讨都不写。应该让这个厂的领导人员公开答复，为什么他们不愿接受工作中的教训，非要坚持错误不可呢？　石安
