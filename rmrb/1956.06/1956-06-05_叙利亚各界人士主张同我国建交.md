    People's Daily Damascus Dispatch: This reporter recently interviewed prominent figures in Syrian political, cultural, and social circles. These individuals all advocated for the early establishment of diplomatic relations between Syria and the People's Republic of China.
    In parliament, almost all members demanded recognition of the People's Republic of China. On June 1st, MP Khaled Bakdash (General Secretary of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Party) told reporters, "I believe it is necessary for Syria to immediately establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. This is the urgent desire of all levels of the Syrian people." Another member of parliament, former Prime Minister Khaled al-Azm, told reporters on the afternoon of June 2nd, "I am in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with China, and the Syrian people are willing to do so." He pointed out that certain external factors have prevented Syria from taking action until now. Some members of parliament indicated that they would raise this issue at the parliamentary meeting scheduled for June 9th.
    Kamil Romani, director of the Damascus International Exposition, told reporters on June 1st, "China and Syria have already established good relations. The Syrian people know that China loves peace and is willing to be friendly with the people of other countries. China's participation in the Damascus Exposition and the visit of a Chinese cultural and artistic delegation to Syria have helped the Syrian people learn more about China. The Syrian people have friendship for the Chinese people. Broad sections of the Syrian people demand the establishment of diplomatic relations with China."
    The reporter posed the same question to Shawqi Baghdadi, Chairman of the Writers Association, and Anour Bapa, a famous radio actor who had visited China. Baghdadi said, "There should be no problem with China and Syria establishing diplomatic relations." Bapa said, "The people ask why the People's Republic of China has not been recognized yet. I think China is a great country, and the Chinese people are a great people."
    Public opinion, mass organizations, and ordinary people with different political views have all expressed their desire to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China as soon as possible, believing that this is in Syria's interest and will help consolidate Syria's independence.

    叙利亚各界人士主张同我国建交
    本报大马士革专电　本报记者最近访问了叙利亚政界、文化界和社会的著名人士。这些人士都主张早日建立叙利亚和中华人民共和国的外交关系。
    在议会里，几乎所有的议员都要求承认中华人民共和国。议员哈勒德·巴克达斯（叙利亚与黎巴嫩共产党总书记）六月一日向记者说，“我认为叙利亚立即同中华人民共和国建立外交关系是必要的，这是叙利亚各阶层人民的迫切愿望。”另一个国会议员、前总理哈勒德·阿泽姆六月二日下午向记者说，“我赞成同中国建立外交关系，叙利亚人是愿意这样做的。”他指出，某些来自外界的因素使得叙利亚到现在还没有采取行动。有的议员表示他们将在定于六月九日举行的议会会议上提出这个问题。
    大马士革国际博览会主任卡米尔·罗马尼在六月一日对记者说，“中国和叙利亚已经建立了良好的关系。叙利亚人民知道中国热爱和平，愿意同其他国家的人民友好。中国参加大马士革博览会和文化艺术代表团访问叙利亚这两件事，帮助了叙利亚人民更多地了解中国。叙利亚人民对中国人怀有友情。叙利亚广大阶层要求同中国建立外交关系。
    记者向作家协会主席萧基·巴格达迪和访问过中国的著名电台演员阿努尔·巴帕提出了同样的问题。巴格达迪说，“中国同叙利亚建立外交关系应该是不成问题的。”巴帕说，“老百姓问道，为什么到现在还不承认中华人民共和国。我认为中国是伟大的国家，中国人民是伟大的人民”。
    具有不同政治见解的舆论，群众组织和普通人民都表示了早日同中华人民共和国建立外交关系的愿望，认为这符合叙利亚的利益，有助于巩固叙利亚的独立。
