    The Yellow Sand River on the Eve of Connection
    Twenty-four kilometers southwest of Huixian County, Gansu Province, lies a narrow valley surrounded by mountains. Towering peaks and the turbulent Jialing River flow day and night. This is the place where the northern and southern construction armies of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will soon converge – the Yellow Sand River.
    Now, this once desolate place is brightly lit all night, and construction workers are working day and night to welcome the arrival of the track-laying team. The thirty young shock brigade members of the Longshuidong Tunnel held a pledge meeting under the wooden sign at the north-south connection point. They raised their arms and said: "We must not be an obstacle to the opening of traffic and complete all tasks ahead of schedule." Braving flying rocks and quicksand, they pried rocks and rushed to repair the collapse project at the arch, and built a 22-meter-long open tunnel in eleven days. Workers in the mixed eleventh team, fighting on the last section of the retaining wall construction site in front of the connection point, recently adopted an independent derrick and created a new record of 18.5 cubic meters completed per person per day.
    At the Yellow Sand River Bridge construction site, bridge workers pasted huge slogans such as "Complete the Baoji-Chengdu Railway ahead of schedule" on the bridge piers, which are more than ten feet high. Trains will soon be running on this bridge.

    接轨前夕的黄沙河
    在甘肃省徽县西南二十四公里处，是个山外套山的狭谷。山峰林立，波涛汹涌的嘉陵江日夜奔流。这就是宝成铁路南北筑路大军不久就要会师的地点——黄沙河。
    现在，这个过去十分荒凉的地方，彻夜灯火辉煌，筑路工人们正夜以继日地劳动着，迎接铺轨队的到来。龙水洞隧道的三十个青年突击队员在南北接轨点的木牌下，举行了誓师会。他们高举着臂膀说：“一定不当通车的障碍，提前完成全部任务。”他们冒着飞石流沙，撬挖岩石，抢修拱门处的坍方工程，十一天就砌好一个长二十二公尺的明峒。战斗在接轨点面前最后一段挡土垟工地上的混合十一中队的工人，最近采用了独立扒杆，创造了每人每天完成18.5方的新纪录。
    在黄沙河大桥工地上，桥梁工人们在十多丈高的桥墩上贴上了“提前修通宝成铁路”的巨幅标语，火车不久就要奔驰在这座大桥上了。
