Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, Cairo Dispatch: On June 23rd, Egypt held a referendum to approve the new constitution and elect a president. From 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, over five million registered Egyptian voters went to the nine thousand polling stations scattered throughout the country to cast their ballots.

    In Cairo, people carrying flags lined up at polling stations from early morning, waiting to vote.

    The draft of the new Egyptian constitution, published on January 16th of this year, was formulated by the government. The new constitution stipulates that Egypt becomes an independent Arab state with a republican system of government. The presidential candidate is the current Prime Minister, Abdel Nasser, nominated by the Revolutionary Command Council.

    Each voter received two ballots at the polling station, a yellow one to indicate whether they approved of the new constitution, and a white one to indicate whether they approved of the election of Abdel Nasser as president. Voters secretly marked a red or black circle to indicate their approval or disapproval. According to the preliminary voting results that have already been published, the new constitution and the presidential candidate received almost unanimous approval.

    Voting was a mandatory obligation for registered male voters. In Egyptian history, women participated in voting for the first time. Their voting was voluntary.

    According to official announcements, the Revolutionary Command Council, which has been in charge of the country since the overthrow of King Farouk in July 1952, held its last meeting at 2:00 AM on the morning of June 23rd. This council will soon be dissolved, transferring power to the president. At the same time, after the new constitution is approved by this vote, it will replace the old constitution formulated under British occupation in 1923.

    公民投票的初步结果
    埃及选民赞成新宪法和纳赛尔当总统
    新华社24日讯　开罗消息：六月二十三日，埃及举行了表决新宪法和选举总统的公民投票。从上午八时到下午五时，已经登记的五百多万埃及选民分别到散布在全国各地的九千个投票站去投票。
    在开罗，人们从清早就打着旗子到投票站排起队来等候投票。
    今年一月十六日公布的埃及新宪法草案是由政府制定的，新宪法规定埃及成为一个独立的、实行共和政体的阿拉伯国家。总统候选人是由革命指导委员会推举的现任总理阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔。
    每个投票者都在投票站领到两张票，一张黄色的用来表示是否赞成新宪法，一张白色的用来表示是否赞成选举阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔为总统。由选民们秘密地划上一个红圈或黑圈来表示赞成或者反对。据已经发表的初步投票结果，新宪法和总统候选人获得几乎完全一致的赞成。
    对已经登记的男选民来说，投票是一项必须履行的义务。在埃及历史上，妇女第一次参加了投票。她们投票与否是听任自便的。
    据官方宣布，自从1952年7月废黜法鲁克国王以后执掌国政的革命指导委员会在六月二十三日清晨二时举行了最后一次的会议，这个委员会即将解散，把权力移交给总统。同时，新宪法经过这次投票批准以后，就将代替1923年在英国占领下制定的旧宪法。
