Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd - The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China announced on June 21st that it would exempt from prosecution and immediately release 335 war criminals, including Kaminaka Masataka, Oya Masaharu, and Kawada Toshio, who were war criminals in custody for their crimes in the war of aggression against China.

This is the first group of Japanese war criminals released by the Chinese government who committed relatively minor crimes and have shown good repentance.

This group of released war criminals has already left the Fushun and Taiyuan Japanese War Criminals Management Centers. Representatives from the Red Cross Society of China headquarters dispatched to these two locations received them and assisted them in boarding trains to Tianjin that evening to assemble in preparation for their return to Japan.

The decision to exempt them from prosecution was announced in Fushun and Taiyuan respectively by Wang Zhiping, Major General of the Military Law and Procurator, and Jing Zhuguo, Procurator, both designated by Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. 295 people were released in Fushun, and 40 people were released in Taiyuan. The announcement of this decision deeply moved all these war criminals who had been granted leniency, and many of them burst into tears on the spot.

Many people attended the announcement of the decision to exempt them from prosecution. In the auditorium of the Fushun Municipal People's Committee, over two hundred members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who had come from Beijing, and representatives of organizations and groups from Fushun City were seated in the audience. After the decision was read out, the procurators called out the names of those exempted from prosecution one by one to verify their identities. The procurators then completed the handover procedures with the representatives of the Red Cross Society of China on the spot.

Ji Feng, the representative from the Red Cross Society of China dispatched to Fushun, and Yi Chengxin, the representative dispatched to Taiyuan, spoke to those who had been exempted from prosecution. They stated that the Red Cross Society of China was willing to carry out the entrustment given by the Chinese government and would do its best to assist in resolving any difficulties or requests that these former Japanese military and government personnel might encounter on their way back to their country.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 22nd - The 335 Japanese war criminals released by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China arrived in Tianjin this afternoon by train from Taiyuan and Fushun, led by representatives of the Red Cross Society of China. 40 people came from Taiyuan and 295 from Fushun. They will wait in Tianjin to board a ship back to Japan.
