Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Tsinghua University Radio Engineering Department graduate student Chen Renhuai, with reference to relevant foreign literature, has successfully trial-produced an automatic electronic trajectory plotter.

Chen Renhuai gave a demonstration of his trial-produced trajectory plotter on the 14th. The main part of the instrument is a three-wheeled trolley controlled by a set of circuits. The front end of the magnifying scale connected to the trolley has a probe. When the trolley is started, the probe detects the electron movement in the electrolytic cell and feeds it back to a set of amplifiers and a simple computer, and then through the control circuit, the pencil behind the trolley draws the trajectory of the electron movement on a grid paper.

Chen Renhuai said: Electron trajectory is the central content of electron optics, and it is necessary to understand electron trajectory when designing new electron tubes. He said: The general method of finding electron trajectories is very time-consuming and cannot fully meet the needs of engineering. It is much more convenient to use an electronic trajectory plotter.

Chen Renhuai's trial production of this automatic electronic trajectory plotter was carried out under the guidance of radio engineering experts Meng Zhaoying and Zhang Siqiu. He consulted many documents and simplified many of the components of trajectory plotters made abroad in the past, but the accuracy is still relatively poor. He used the design of this instrument as his graduation thesis and received an excellent grade.

    清华大学研究生陈仁怀试制成自动电子轨迹仪
    新华社17日讯　清华大学无线电工程系研究生陈仁怀参考外国有关的文献，试制成一部自动电子轨迹仪。
    陈仁怀十四日把他试制的这部轨迹仪作过一次表演。仪器的主要部分是一个受一套电路控制着的三轮小车，小车所联结的放大尺前端有一颗探针。小车一开动，探针在电解槽中将探测到的电子运动的情况，反应到一套放大器和简单的计算机构上去，再通过控制电路，小车后面的铅笔就在一张方格纸上绘出电子运动的轨迹。
    陈仁怀说：电子轨迹为电子光学的中心内容，设计新的电子管时，需要了解电子轨迹。他说：一般求电子轨迹的方法很费时，不能完全满足工程上的需要。利用电子轨迹仪就便利得多了。
    陈仁怀试制这部自动电子轨迹仪，是在无线电工程专家孟昭英、张思虬的指导下进行的，他参考了许多文献，简化了过去国外制造轨迹仪的许多机件，但精确度还比较差，他用这部仪器的设计作为他的毕业论文，得到优等评分。
