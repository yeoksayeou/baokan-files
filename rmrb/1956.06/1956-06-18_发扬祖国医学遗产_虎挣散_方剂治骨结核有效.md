Xinhua News Agency Report: The effectiveness rate of treating bone tuberculosis and joint tuberculosis with the traditional Chinese medicine "Hu Zheng San" formula has reached 82%. This is the result of observations made by the Dalian Bone and Joint Tuberculosis Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment Research Group from the clinical efficacy of two hundred cases after more than a year of treatment and research.

Bone tuberculosis and joint tuberculosis have always been considered stubborn diseases that are difficult to treat. In the winter of 1954, Zhang Yichen, vice president of a sanatorium in Dalian, and traditional Chinese medicine doctor Wang Dongguo jointly studied the use of the traditional Chinese medicine "Hu Zheng San" formula to treat this disease. Later, Western medicine doctors Guo Qingping and Huang Chuiliu were also recruited to participate, forming a research group. From last year to June of this year, they have treated more than 300 patients. These individuals were all patients diagnosed with bone tuberculosis and joint tuberculosis by various hospitals.

    “虎挣散”方剂治骨结核有效
    据新华社讯　用中药“虎挣散”方剂治疗骨结核和关节结核的有效率，已经达到82％。这是旅大市骨结核和关节结核中医疗法研究小组，经过一年多的治疗研究，从二百个病例的临床疗效中观察的结果。
    骨结核和关节结核，向来被认为是难以治疗的痼疾。1954年冬天，大连某疗养院副院长张一忱和中医师王栋国，共同研究用中药“虎挣散”方剂治疗这种病，后来又吸收郭清平、黄垂柳两位西医师参加，组成研究小组。去年一年到今年6月共治疗了三百多个患者。这些人都是经各医院确定为骨结核和关节结核的患者。
