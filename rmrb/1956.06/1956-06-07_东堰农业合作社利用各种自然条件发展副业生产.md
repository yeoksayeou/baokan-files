Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 5th: The Dongyan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, has recently received many visitors who have come to learn about their methods for developing diversified economic activities.

　　The Dongyan Cooperative is located on the plain south of Hangzhou Bay, surrounded by numerous rivers and bodies of water. The cooperative members utilize these natural conditions to seek ways to develop diverse operations. They raise fish in the water, raise ducks on the water surface, use duck droppings from the river to feed the fish, and use snails from the river to feed the ducks. The cooperative members also cultivate an aquatic plant called "Revolutionary Grass" in the river, which is used to feed pigs and sheep. Many dry lands by the roadside and field corners have been opened up and planted with pumpkins, bitter vegetables, and tubers, which serve as feed for pig farming.

　　Currently, this cooperative raises a total of 1,026 old ducks, 220 ducklings, 40 sheep, 40 pigs, and many chickens and fish. The current flock of over one thousand old ducks can lay about nine hundred eggs per day. After deducting costs from sales, they can earn about thirty-five yuan per day, and the annual sideline income is expected to be more than thirty-seven thousand yuan, accounting for 19.5% of the total agricultural and sideline income. These revenues not only provide funds for the cooperative to expand reproduction but also overcome the livelihood difficulties of the cooperative members.

　　The cooperative's sideline production is entirely carried out by a sideline production brigade. Among the thirty-one members of the team, most are elderly, weak, disabled, or otherwise unable to directly participate in agricultural production. The team assigns them appropriate tasks based on their special skills and health conditions. Cooperative member Wang Agou has a disability in his leg, which makes it difficult for him to move around, so the team assigned him to raise ducks, managing the duck flock from a small boat every day. Several elderly female cooperative members are responsible for cooking and feeding the feed, and they are all doing well.

　　This year, the cooperative's area of double-cropping interplanted rice and continuous cropping rice accounts for 80% of the total acreage. The agricultural production requires more labor than in previous years, but because they organize the elderly, weak, and other semi-able-bodied people to engage in sideline production, agricultural production has not been affected.

### 东堰农业合作社利用各种自然条件发展副业生产

    东堰农业合作社利用各种自然条件发展副业生产
    据新华社杭州5日电　浙江省绍兴县东堰农业生产合作社最近接待了许多前来参观的客人，介绍了他们发展多种经济的门路。
    东堰社在杭州湾南岸的平原上，周围河多水多，社员们就利用这些自然条件找寻发展多种经营的门路。他们在水里养鱼，水上放鸭，河里的鸭粪喂鱼，河里的螺丝又喂鸭。社员们还在河里养了一种叫做“革命草”的水草，用来喂猪和羊。很多路边和田角的旱地都开了出来，种上了南瓜、苦麻菜和薯类，作为养猪的饲料。
    现在，这个社一共养了1，026只老鸭，二百二十只小鸭，四十只绵羊，四十口猪，还有许多小鸡和鱼。现在养的一千多只老鸭，每天可以产蛋九百个左右，出卖以后，除去成本，每天可以收入三十五元，全年副业收入预计可有三万七千多元。占农副业总收入19.5％。这些收入，不但为社里提供了扩大再生产的资金，也克服了社员的生活困难。
    这个社的副业生产是全部由一个副业大队进行的。全队三十一个社员中，大都是老弱、残疾等不能直接参加农业生产的人。队里根据大家的特长和健康、身体情况，分配他们适当的工作。社员王阿苟脚有残疾，行动不方便，队里便叫他放鸭，每天坐在小船上管理鸭群。几个老年女社员，担任了煮、喂饲料的工作，全都干得很好。
    这个社今年改种双季间作稻和连作稻的面积，占总田亩80％。农业生产需要的劳动力比往年增多了，但是由于他们组织老弱等半劳动力进行副业生产，农业生产并没有受到影响。
