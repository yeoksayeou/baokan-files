    Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory
    Trial-Producing Ten Different Car Instruments
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory is currently trial-producing complete car instrument panels in its newly built facility. As of the 7th, workers in the car instrument assembly workshop had already assembled eight semi-finished water temperature gauges and oil pressure gauges.
    A complete set of car instruments consists of ten different types of instruments. Previously, China could only produce individual car instruments. To produce high-quality, complete car instrument panels and support the First Automobile Works, the factory, after a long period of preparation, officially began trial production on June 1st. The stamping workshop, which is responsible for processing the most major components of car instruments, has now completed 85 of the 157 types of parts it processes. Technical personnel from functional departments are in the workshop every day, working with the workers to solve various difficulties encountered during the trial production. The assembly workshop, which specializes in assembling car instruments, had thirty female assembly workers who had undergone nearly two years of technical training enter the workshop at the end of May. They are actively improving their assembly skills. This workshop also sent letters to various processing workshops, guaranteeing that the instruments would be assembled in a timely manner, and hoping that the processing workshops would supply parts in a timely manner, working together to strive for the early trial production of a batch of complete car instruments.

    哈尔滨电表仪器厂    
    试制十种不同的汽车仪表
    据新华社讯　在新建的哈尔滨电表仪器厂里正在试制完整的汽车仪表。到七日为止，汽车仪表装配车间的工人，已经装配出八个水温表、油压表的半成品。
    一套完整的汽车仪表，是由十种不同的仪表组成的。过去国内只能生产个别的汽车仪表。为了做出质量优良的完整的汽车仪表，支援第一汽车制造厂，这个厂经过较长时期的准备，在六月一日开始了正式的试制工作。担负加工汽车仪表主要部件最多的冲压车间，在它加工的157种部件中，现在已经完成了八十五种。职能部门的技术人员每天都在车间里，和工人一起解决试制中发生的各种困难。专门装配汽车仪表的装配车间，在五月底就有三十名经过近两年技术学习的装配女工，进入了车间。她们正在积极提高装配技术。这个车间，还向各加工车间发出信件，保证及时把仪表装配好，并且希望加工车间及时供应部件，共同争取早日试制出一批完整的汽车仪表。
