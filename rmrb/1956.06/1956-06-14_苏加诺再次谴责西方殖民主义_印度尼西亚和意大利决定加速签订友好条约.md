Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 13th: Indonesian President Sukarno concluded his visit to Italy on the 12th. Following the visit, the Italian government issued a communique stating that the two countries have decided to expedite the signing of a treaty of friendship between them and to hold negotiations for a new trade agreement.

The communique stated that during the talks, the two countries discussed various issues related to both countries and the relations between them. Inspired by “a common spirit of peace and a shared determination to defend the aspirations of all peoples for freedom and independence,” the two governments decided to “take effective joint action” within the United Nations.

The communique also mentioned Italy's provision of assistance for Indonesia's economic development and the immediate opening of a shipping route from Italian ports to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 12th: Indonesian President Sukarno, who is currently visiting Italy, once again condemned colonialism at a press conference held in Rome last night. He said that Asia's struggle for independence is not over and that this struggle will continue until Asians are completely free.

Sukarno said that the current chaos in Asia is "the result and aftermath of colonialism, not caused by the liberating influence of nationalism." He pointed out that "colonialism has not died."

Sukarno said: We are not against the West. However, there is one manifestation of the West that we and all Asians will forever oppose, and that is colonialism.

Speaking on the West Irian issue, Sukarno said: "We seek the unification of our country and are working for and will work for West Irian to return to the embrace of Indonesia."

"We do this because it is a very painful thing for us that any part of our country should still suffer from the scourge of colonialism, and no words can hide the fact that colonialism still rules this place."

In response to a question from a reporter, Sukarno said that he hoped the Algerian issue could also be resolved in the same way as the Moroccan and Tunisian issues were resolved.

President Sukarno arrived in Rome on the 10th after concluding his visit to Canada. On the 11th, Sukarno held talks with Italian President Gronchi, Prime Minister Segni, and Foreign Minister Martino.

The diplomatic envoys of the twenty Asian and African countries in Rome who participated in the Bandung Conference also held a reception yesterday to welcome Sukarno.

    苏加诺再次谴责西方殖民主义
    印度尼西亚和意大利决定加速签订友好条约
    新华社13日讯　罗马消息：印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在十二日结束了对意大利的访问。访问结束后，意大利政府发表公报说，两国已经决定加速签订两国之间的友好条约，并且举行谈判签订一项新的贸易协定。
    公报说：两国在这次会谈中讨论了各种同这两个国家有关的问题和这两个国家之间的关系问题。两国政府被“和平的共同精神和保卫各国人民争取自由和独立的抱负的共同决心所鼓舞”，决定在联合国内“有效地采取共同行动”。
    公报还提到意大利对印度尼西亚的经济发展提供援助以及立即开辟一条从意大利港口到印度尼西亚首都雅加达的航线等问题。
    据新华社12日讯　罗马消息：正在意大利访问的印度尼西亚总统苏加诺昨天晚上在罗马举行的一个记者招待会上，又一次谴责殖民主义。他说，亚洲为争取独立而进行的斗争并没有结束，这种斗争将继续进行到亚洲人完全自由为止。
    苏加诺说，亚洲目前的混乱是“殖民主义的结果和余殃，而不是由于民族主义的解放影响所造成的”。他指出，现在“殖民主义并没有死亡”。
    苏加诺说：我们并不反对西方。但是，西方有一种表现是我们及所有的亚洲人都要永远反对的，那就是殖民主义。
    在谈到西伊里安问题的时候，苏加诺说：“我们寻求我们国家的统一，并且正在为和将要为西伊里安重新回到印度尼西亚的怀抱而努力。”
      “我们之所以这样作，是因为我们国家的任何部分竟仍然遭受殖民主义的祸害，这对于我们来说是一件非常痛苦的事情，任何言语都不能掩盖殖民主义仍然统治着这个地方的事实。”
    在回答记者提出的问题的时候，苏加诺说，他希望阿尔及利亚问题也能够按照解决摩洛哥问题和突尼斯问题的那种方针得到解决。
    苏加诺总统结束在加拿大的访问后，是于十日到达罗马的。十一日，苏加诺同意大利总统格隆基、总理塞尼、外交部长马蒂诺举行了会谈。
    参加万隆会议的二十个亚非国家驻罗马的外交使节也在昨天举行了招待会，招待苏加诺。
