    President Sukarno's Trip to the United States

    After a nineteen-day visit to the United States, President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia has left the United States to visit Canada. During his stay in the United States, President Sukarno was warmly welcomed and lavishly received by the American public. He delivered several important speeches and talks, in which he incisively expounded Indonesia's independent, active, and peaceful foreign policy, drawing great attention from world public opinion.

    Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo stated at a press conference on May 17th that one of the main objectives of President Sukarno's visit to the United States was to inform the American authorities and people about Indonesia's struggle for complete freedom and independence, to enhance mutual understanding between Indonesia and the United States, and to make the United States understand Indonesia's independent foreign policy. President Sukarno brilliantly completed the task entrusted to him by the Indonesian people. In his important speeches, he emphasized opposition to so-called military aid and enslaving economic aid, opposition to atomic warfare, opposition to colonialism, advocating national independence, the recovery of West Irian, and peaceful coexistence with all countries. These views undoubtedly reflect the will of the Indonesian people to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, strive for peace and international cooperation, and also powerfully express the common aspirations of many countries in the Asian-African region.

    Indonesia's independent foreign policy is based on the actual requirements of its national interests. Indonesia, like many Asian and African countries, is a rich and young nation. Before independence, it suffered from Western colonial rule for 350 years and deeply suffered the harms and pains of colonialism. Only in the eleven years since independence has Indonesia made significant progress in all aspects. Therefore, it is entirely understandable that the Indonesian people, in order to consolidate their national independence, resolutely refuse to join any military blocs, refuse to accept enslaving economic aid, actively strive to get along with all countries on an equal and friendly footing, and make contributions to the cause of world peace. President Sukarno pointed out in his speech that no matter how large the amount of American aid, it is useless if its purpose is not peace. He also said: "We would rather work bare-handed in our land and jungles than exchange any part of our freedom for any kind of aid." This demonstrates the noble will of a nation that has undergone a long and heroic struggle to cherish its own independent sovereignty and peace.

    President Sukarno emphasized opposition to colonialism and reiterated that West Irian must be returned to Indonesia. He said that West Irian is a colonial stronghold on Indonesian territory, and without West Irian, Indonesia is incomplete. President Sukarno originally hoped that his just appeal would receive the support of the United States, which has always proclaimed its "opposition to colonialism." However, Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani, who accompanied President Sukarno on his visit to the United States, discussed the West Irian issue with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who clearly stated that the United States could not support Indonesia's legitimate demands for West Irian. This once again exposed the hypocrisy of the United States in international affairs.

    The United States, in the West Irian issue, is actually actively supporting Dutch colonialism, just as it supports Portugal in the Indian Goa issue. Its attitude was clearly demonstrated during the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly when the West Irian issue was discussed. The United States adopts this attitude because it is itself a plunderer of West Irian's wealth. American investment in most of the oil enterprises in West Irian is even greater than that of the Netherlands. The United States also has significant interests in uranium mines and other resources. The United States' refusal to support Indonesia's just demands is by no means accidental.

    During his visit to the United States, President Sukarno repeatedly stated that the People's Republic of China should be restored to its legitimate seat in the United Nations, emphasizing that the reality of China, with its 600 million people, should be recognized. This is a powerful support for the Chinese people's legitimate status in the United Nations.

    President Sukarno's visit to the United States has clearly achieved significant success. Indonesia's independent, peaceful, and neutral policy has been understood by the ordinary people of the United States and has won the sympathy of the people and public opinion of various countries in the world.

    Indonesia's pursuit of an independent, peaceful, and neutral policy has greatly enhanced its international status. Some people in New York expressed the opinion that the United States' unusually long time to welcome President Sukarno "shows that the United States has recently adopted a 'special attitude' towards Asian countries like Indonesia that have adopted an independent foreign policy." The fact that the U.S. authorities, who have always been accustomed to not respecting other countries, have adopted a "special attitude" this time illustrates this point.

    President Sukarno's visit to the United States is the beginning of his planned visits to a series of countries in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. We firmly believe that through these visits, Indonesia's independent foreign policy will be understood by more countries and peoples, and the friendship between the Indonesian people and the peoples of various countries will be strengthened. This will not only benefit the Indonesian people's struggle to consolidate national independence and oppose colonialism but will also bring a favorable influence to the cause of world peace and cooperation.

### 苏加诺总统的美国之行

    苏加诺总统的美国之行
    印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺，在美国进行了十九天的访问之后，已经离开美国到加拿大访问。苏加诺总统在美国停留期间，受到美国公众的热烈欢迎和隆重接待，并曾多次发表重要的演说和谈话，对印度尼西亚独立的积极的和平外交政策作了精辟的阐述，引起了世界各国舆论的极大重视。
    印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约五月十七日在记者招待会上说，苏加诺总统这次访问美国的主要目的之一，是要把印度尼西亚为争取完全自由和独立的斗争告诉美国当局和人民，以增进印度尼西亚和美国之间的互相了解，使美国了解印度尼西亚的独立外交政策。苏加诺总统出色地完成了印度尼西亚人民付托给他的任务。他在各次重要的演说中，强调反对所谓军事援助和奴役性的经济援助，反对原子战争，反对殖民主义，主张民族独立，收复西伊里安，同一切国家和平共处。他的这些看法，无疑地反映了印度尼西亚人民维护国家独立主权、争取和平和国际合作的意志，同时也有力地表达了亚非地区许多国家的共同愿望。
    印度尼西亚独立的外交政策，是根据它的民族利益的实际要求出发的。印度尼西亚同许多亚非国家一样，是一个富饶的年轻的国家。它在独立以前，曾经遭受西方殖民主义的统治达三百五十年之久，深受殖民主义的祸害和痛苦。只有在独立以后的十一年里，印度尼西亚才在各方面有了长足的发展。因此，印度尼西亚人民为了巩固自己的民族独立，坚决不参加任何军事集团，不接受奴役性的经济援助，积极争取同一切国家平等友好相处，并对世界的和平事业作出贡献，是完全可以理解的。苏加诺总统在他的演说里指出，不论美国援助的数量多么庞大，如果它的目的不是和平，它就毫无用处。他还说：“我们宁愿赤手空拳地在我们的土地上和丛林中进行劳动，也不愿意拿我们任何一部分自由去交换任何种类的援助。”这表现了一个经过长期英勇奋斗的民族珍爱自己的独立主权和和平的崇高意志。
    苏加诺总统强调反对殖民主义，并重申西伊里安必须归还印度尼西亚。他说，西伊里安是印度尼西亚领土上的殖民地据点，没有西伊里安，印度尼西亚就是肢体不全。苏加诺总统原期望他的这个正义的呼吁，能得到口口声声标榜“反对殖民主义”的美国的支持。但是，随同苏加诺总统访问美国的印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼同美国国务卿杜勒斯讨论了西伊里安问题，杜勒斯却明白地表示美国不能支持印度尼西亚对西伊里安的正当要求，这就又一次暴露了美国在国际事务中的虚伪态度。
    美国在西伊里安问题上，和它在印度果阿问题上支持葡萄牙一样，其实从来就是积极支持荷兰殖民主义的。在第十届联合国大会讨论西伊里安问题的时候，它的这种态度就明白地表现出来了。美国采取这种态度，是因为它自己就是西伊里安财富的掠夺者。在西伊里安的大部分石油企业中，美国的投资比荷兰还多。在铀矿和其他资源方面，美国也有着很大的利益。美国拒绝支持印度尼西亚的正义要求，绝不是偶然的。
    苏加诺总统在访问美国期间，曾一再表示应该恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位，强调应当正视拥有六亿人民的中国的现实。这是对中国人民在联合国的合法地位的有力支持。
    苏加诺总统的访问美国，显然获得了重大的成就。印度尼西亚独立的和平中立政策，已为美国的普通人民所了解，并且得到了世界各国人民和舆论的同情。
    印度尼西亚奉行独立的和平中立政策，使得它的国际地位大大提高了。纽约某些人士表示意见说，美国用异常长的时间来欢迎苏加诺总统，“表明美国对像印度尼西亚这样采取独立外交政策的亚洲国家最近采取了‘特殊的态度’”。一向习惯于不尊重其他国家的美国当局这一次采取了“特殊的态度”，就说明了这个道理。
    苏加诺总统访问美国之行，是他预定要访问欧美和亚洲一系列国家的开始。我们深信，通过这些访问，必将使印度尼西亚的独立的外交政策为更多的国家人民所了解，加强印度尼西亚人民同各国人民之间的友谊，而这不仅有利于印度尼西亚人民巩固民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争，并且会给世界和平和合作的事业带来有利的影响。
