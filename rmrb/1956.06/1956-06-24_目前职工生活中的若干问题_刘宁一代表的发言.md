Several Problems in the Current Life of Employees
—Speech by Representative Liu Ningyi

    Housing Problems—Heavy Burden of Medical Expenses—Employee Canteen Problems—Childcare Services Lag Behind Needs
    Overcoming Bureaucratic and Capitalist Ideological Styles—Reasonably Solving Employees' Living Problems

    I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Minister Liao Luyan's explanation of the draft model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and I suggest that the congress approve this model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives. Now I would like to express some opinions on several problems in the current life of employees.

    Gradually improving the material and cultural living standards of employees on the basis of developing production is a consistent policy adopted by our Party and the state. All the measures of our country are ultimately for the benefit of the working people. In the past few years, with the restoration and development of the national economy, the number of employees has increased year by year, workers' wages have increased, and workers' welfare facilities have also been expanded. Compared with before liberation, the material and cultural life of employees has been significantly improved, which is an undeniable fact.

    In the past two years, the vast number of employees have highly demonstrated their initiative and creativity in production and construction, and labor productivity has rapidly increased. However, the improvement of employees' living standards is not commensurate with the increase in labor productivity. That is to say, the extent of improvement in employees' living standards is not as much as it could have been. This is most prominent in the issue of wages. Due to the failure to adjust wages in a timely manner, the old, unreasonable reward system was abolished, and a new, reasonable reward system was not established in a timely manner, which prevented workers' wages from increasing as necessary, and even reduced the actual income of some workers. This situation has attracted the attention of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. The State Council convened a national wage conference from February to April this year, deciding to conduct a reform of China's current wage system on the basis of increasing wages. This decision immediately received the warm support of employees across the country, stimulating even greater enthusiasm for labor among the masses of employees. I don't plan to talk much about this aspect. Here, I would like to talk about several other problems in the current life of employees that urgently need to be solved:

    1.  The housing problem is a major problem in the current life of employees. This problem has two aspects: on the one hand, there is an insufficient number of houses; on the other hand, rent and utility costs are high (this problem does not exist in a few enterprises). In terms of the number of houses, since liberation, the state has allocated huge amounts of funds to build houses for workers. The houses built before 1952 can accommodate 1 million people. In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, the state built residences for employees and public employees, with the central ministries alone reaching 19.23 million square meters. If combined with the local constructions, the total is about 30 million square meters. Although the state has made such great efforts and provided housing for millions of employees, the housing problem for employees is still very tight because the housing conditions for employees were too harsh during the reactionary rule in the past, and the industrial population has grown rapidly since liberation. The speed of housing increase is still far behind the needs of industrial development and the needs of employees. For example, in Shenyang, the residential area has increased by 31.2% since liberation, but the number of employees has increased by 217%; the residential area of Yumen Oilfield has increased by 3.9 times, but the number of employees has increased by 11.6 times. Due to the shortage of housing, many employees live in very poor conditions, some living in earthen caves and bunkers, some living with several families in one room or several generations in one room, and some living in cramped, humid, and dark conditions. According to incomplete statistics from 18 provinces, 3 cities, and two industries, about 10% of the total number of employees urgently need housing.

    From the current living standards of employees, rents in most cities are relatively high. According to surveys in several major cities, the rent paid by workers accounts for about 5% to 10% of their wages; renting private houses can reach 20%, or even higher. Some public utilities in some cities have not earnestly implemented the policy of serving the masses, and profits are generally high. Utility and transportation costs are not entirely reasonable, and ticket prices have been rising year after year. For example, the monthly ticket price of the Shenyang Electric Tram Company increased by 277% in 1955 compared to 1950. The same is true for tap water in Shenyang, where the profit per ton of water is 200%. The profit for lighting electricity in Shanghai is 500%. These are important factors that cause difficulties in the lives of employees.

    2.  Employees and their families bear a relatively heavy burden of medical expenses. There are many shortcomings in the labor protection work of many enterprises, and disease prevention and injury prevention work are not carried out well. Therefore, the disease situation of employees in many enterprises is serious, and employee absenteeism due to illness accounts for about 5% of the number of employees. Due to the imperfect medical system, some medical personnel have poor service attitudes, and medical accidents often occur in enterprises. In terms of medical expenses, because the labor insurance regulations stipulate that expensive medicines are paid for by individuals, the subsidy for employees with long-term illnesses is too low, and the price of medicines is too high, which increases the difficulties for employees. Originally, in 1954, the Ministry of Health stipulated that the markup rate for expensive medicines should generally not exceed 10% to 15% of the original price, but this was not earnestly implemented at the lower levels, and various places raised the prices of medicines. The Shandong Health Department raised the markup rate for expensive medicines to 20% to 30%, and ordinary medicines to 40% to 70%. Jinan City raised the markup rate for some medicines to 400%, and Shanghai's markup rate for magnesium oxide was 150%, ephedrine 194%, and atropine 400%. At the same time, hospitalization costs are too expensive and unreasonable deposit systems are stipulated, which further creates difficulties for employees. According to a survey, about 4.5% of workers have an average debt of 63 yuan due to medical treatment for themselves or their families.

    3.  There are also problems in the employee canteens. In order to reduce enterprise management costs, some enterprise administrations require canteens to be "self-sufficient" and "enterprised," including all or part of the salaries and additional salaries of canteen staff, cooking equipment, and repair costs in the employee food expenses. This increases the burden on employees and reduces the quality of meals. Canteen staff, fearing "losses," also try to make profits, reducing the quantity and quality of food and raising food prices in disguise. Food costs generally increase by 15% to 30%. For example, the canteen of the Kunming Machine Tool Factory makes a lot of money. In addition to using 514.27 yuan to build a stable, it had a balance of 11,658.58 yuan by the end of April. For example, the Jilin Provincial Construction Company stipulates that the employee canteen must extract a profit of 1,200 yuan per month, so the canteen proposes to strive for a profit of forty yuan per day.

    4.  In general mining areas, forest areas, geological exploration units, salt areas, new railway lines, and certain cities, there are also problems in the supply of non-staple foods and daily necessities. Generally, the quantity is small, the variety is small, the quality is poor, and the price is high. In some commercial departments, there are also erroneous ideas such as "not doing it if the profit is small, not doing it if it is troublesome, and not doing it if the transportation is inconvenient."

    5.  At present, China's childcare services also lag behind the needs. After liberation, the childcare services have developed rapidly. Now there are 6,902 nurseries and breastfeeding rooms, accommodating more than 190,000 children. Dormitories and street nurseries have also developed a lot. However, it is still far from the actual needs, and the problem of childcare for female employees in the vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises, institutions, and schools has not been basically solved. Some female employees cannot go to work because of this, and even if they go to work, they cannot concentrate on their work. In the past one or two years, the fees for some nurseries have also increased. For example, all the expenses of the nursery of the Qiqihar Thermal Power Third Company are borne by the female workers, and each child pays 40 yuan per month. After August last year, the postal and telecommunications system generally increased the fees for each child by 1 to 8 yuan per month.

    In accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's concern for the lives of employees, with the support of the State Council, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently convened a national trade union labor insurance and housing work conference, which was attended by representatives from the people's committees of various provinces and cities and the committees of the Communist Party of China in various provinces and cities. This meeting studied the problems existing in the current life of employees, and with the support and assistance of all parties, formulated specific recommendations for solving these problems, which will be submitted to the State Council for adoption and implementation.

    It must be pointed out that, due to the excessively harsh living and housing conditions of employees during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, although there has been a significant improvement since liberation, these remaining problems cannot be completely solved immediately. In addition, some new problems have also arisen in the development of China's economic construction, and some problems cannot be solved all at once in the short term. However, most of these problems should be solved quickly and can be solved. The reason why these problems arise is mainly because some enterprise leaders and trade union organizations have not sufficiently implemented the policy of gradually improving the lives of employees on the basis of increasing production, which has been repeatedly instructed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and there is a tendency to not care about the lives of employees. This tendency can be attributed to two aspects: one is the bureaucratic ideological style, and the other is the capitalist ideological style. The main manifestations of the bureaucratic ideological style are being satisfied with the existing achievements and not understanding the living conditions of the masses; or opposing production and life, and unilaterally believing that "production is a big matter, and life is a small matter." Under the control of this ideological style, many problems in the lives of employees that could have been solved have not been solved. For example, housing, canteens, etc. are originally necessary living conditions for organizing workers' production labor, and the state also stipulates a certain investment in construction, and there are also enterprise bonuses that can be used, but some departments and enterprises did not plan these aspects of construction when carrying out construction, and even used the state's investment in building worker housing to build offices and repair roads, resulting in the increasingly serious shortage of housing and canteens. The capitalist ideological style is mainly manifested in excessive enthusiasm for profit and disregard for the lives of the masses. For example, public utilities such as urban transportation and tap water should take serving the people and serving production as their operating principles, and should increase income on the premise of improving service quality and strengthening management, but some units simply pursue profits and repeatedly raise prices, thereby increasing the burden on employees. Even medical and health care and employee canteens make high profits, which is extremely wrong. Bureaucratic and capitalist ideological styles seriously harm the vital interests of employees and are the root cause of the long-term existence of difficult problems in the current lives of employees.

    The real solution to the problem of the difficult lives of the masses of employees lies in overcoming the bureaucratic and capitalist ideological styles that do not care about the vital interests of the masses of employees. Facts have proved that as long as enterprise leaders, trade union organizations, and relevant parties pay attention to the living problems of employees, then the problem of the difficult lives of employees is almost half solved. Therefore, we hope that the national economic departments and various enterprises will conduct an inspection and appropriate arrangement of the employee housing problem, plan the lives of employees at the same time as planning production, and establish special institutions for managing employee welfare and housing construction; in factories and enterprises, there must be a vice-factory director in charge of managing employee welfare and housing construction, to overcome the current phenomenon of no one being responsible for employee welfare. Moreover, we suggest that collective contracts be widely signed in various enterprises, so that specific measures can be taken on issues such as production, wages, labor protection, employee welfare, promotion of advanced experience, improvement of workers' technical level, and consolidation of labor discipline. This is not only conducive to improving product quality, reducing costs, further improving labor productivity, and comprehensively completing various indicators of the national plan, but also can better utilize the state's appropriations for improving safety and health conditions and welfare facilities, and improve the material and cultural living standards of employees in a planned and step-by-step manner in accordance with the principle of necessity and possibility.

    In addition, we suggest that relevant parties take measures to reasonably solve the problem of employee rent; urban public utilities, especially water, electricity, and transportation enterprises that are closely related to the lives of employees, should also take measures to plan to reduce management costs and reduce costs to reduce the burden on consumers; medical and health departments should appropriately adjust drug prices and abolish unreasonable systems such as hospitalization deposits to reduce the burden on employees in terms of medical expenses; commercial departments should continuously improve business management, plan to expand and adjust commercial networks, and reasonably adjust commodity prices to ensure the material supply of factory and mining enterprises, especially forestry workers, surveying and drilling personnel, railway new line engineering personnel, and other field workers whose lives are very difficult.

    Regarding the issue of employee life, our trade union organizations bear great responsibility. In the past few years, we have not given enough attention to the lives of employees, rarely put forward specific suggestions to relevant parties in a timely manner to solve the difficulties of employees, and rarely carried out serious struggles against phenomena that violate the policies and laws of the Party and the state and harm the interests of the masses, thus the trade union organizations have become detached from the masses. Therefore, trade union organizations should earnestly improve their work style, overcome bureaucratic tendencies, go deep into the masses to listen to their opinions, understand their emotions and demands, and assist relevant parties in meeting the needs of employees. Only in this way can we widely and deeply carry out the advanced producer movement, comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, more economical, and safe production, and continuously improve labor productivity. We should strive to improve the living conditions of employees, to highly demonstrate the initiative and creativity of employees, and strive to realize the 1956 national budget and to complete the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule.

    目前职工生活中的若干问题
    ——刘宁一代表的发言
    居住问题——疾病医疗负担较重——职工食堂问题——托儿事业赶不上需要
    克服官僚主义和资本主义的思想作风——合理解决职工生活问题
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，以及廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明，并且建议大会批准这个高级农业生产合作社示范章程。现在我仅就目前职工生活中的若干问题发表一点意见。
    在发展生产的基础上，逐步地提高职工的物质生活和文化生活水平，这是我们的党和国家一贯采取的方针。我们国家的一切措施，归根结蒂都是为了劳动人民的福利。几年来，随着国民经济的恢复与发展，职工就业人数逐年增加，工人的工资有了增长，工人的福利设施也有了扩大，同解放前比较，职工的物质生活和文化生活都有了显著的改善，这是有目共睹的事实。
    近两年来，广大职工群众在生产建设中高度地发挥了积极性和创造性，劳动生产率迅速地提高了。不过，职工生活的改善同劳动生产率的提高来比较，则是不相适应的。这就是说，职工生活改善的程度同可能达到的程度来比较，是做得不够的，这在工资问题上表现得最突出。由于工资没有及时调整，旧的不合理的奖励制度取消了，新的合理的奖励制度又没有及时地建立起来，这就使工人的工资没有得到必要的增长，甚至部分工人的实际收入还有所降低。这种情况已经引起了中共中央和国务院的重视。国务院在今年2月至4月间召开了全国工资会议，决定对我国现行的工资制度在增加工资的基础上进行一次改革。这个决定立即得到了全国职工的热烈拥护，激发了职工群众的更高的劳动热情。这方面我不准备多讲。在这里，我想讲一下当前职工生活中存在的迫切要求解决的另外几个问题：
    一、居住问题是目前职工生活中的一个重大问题。这个问题有两方面：一方面是住宅数量不够；另一方面是房租、水电费高（少数企业不存在这个问题）。从住宅数量上来说，解放后几年来国家拨出巨大款项为工人修建住宅，1952年以前建筑的住宅可供100万人居住，第一个五年计划的前三年国家修建的职工和公教人员的住宅，仅中央各部系统就达1，923万平方公尺，如果连同地方所建筑的一并计算，共约3，000多万平方公尺。虽然国家作了这样大的努力，供给了几百万职工的住宅，但是由于过去反动统治时期职工居住条件过于恶劣，解放后工业人口又迅速增长，住宅增加的速度还远远赶不上工业发展的需要和职工群众的需要，所以目前职工住宅问题仍然很紧张。比如沈阳，解放以来住宅面积增加了31.2％，职工人数却增加了217％；玉门油矿住宅面积增加了3.9倍，职工却增加了11.6倍。由于住宅不足，不少职工居住条件很差，有的住在土洞、碉堡里，有的几家同居一室或几代同居一室，有的拥挤、潮湿、黑暗。像这样迫切要求住宅的，据18个省3个市两个产业不完全的统计，约占职工总数的10％。
    从目前职工生活水平来看，大多数城市的房租是偏高的。据几个大城市的调查，工人支付的房租约占工资的5％至10％；租赁私人房屋的有的达到20％，甚至更高些。某些城市公用事业没有认真贯彻为群众服务的方针，利润一般偏高，水电交通费用不尽合理，有的连年涨票价。例如沈阳市电车公司月票票价1955年比1950年提高了277％，沈阳市自来水也是如此，每吨水的利润是200％。上海市照明用电的利润是500％。这些都是造成职工生活困难的重要因素。
    二、职工和职工家属的疾病医疗负担较重。许多企业的劳动保护工作中存在不少缺点，防病防伤工作进行得不好，因而不少企业里职工疾病情况是严重的，职工因病缺勤大约占职工人数的5％左右。由于医疗制度不够完善，有些医务人员服务态度不好，企业中还常常发生医疗事故。在医疗费用方面，因为劳动保险条例规定贵重药品自理，对长期疾病的职工补助费偏低，再加上药品价格过高，这就增加了职工的困难。本来1954年卫生部曾规定贵重药品的加成率一般不超过原定价的10％到15％，但是下面并未认真执行，各地把药价提高。山东卫生厅把贵重药品加成率提高到20％到30％，普通药品提高到40％到70％。济南市把一些药品加成率提高到400％，上海的加成率氧化镁150％，麻黄素194％，阿托品400％。同时，住院费用太贵而且规定了不合理的押金制度，更造成了职工的困难。据调查，约有4.5％的工人因本人或家属看病平均负债63元。
    三、在职工食堂方面也存在着问题。某些企业行政为了减少企业管理费用，要求食堂“自给自足”、“企业化”，将食堂工作人员的工资及附加工资、炊具设备、修缮费等全部或一部计算在职工伙食费中，这就增加了职工的负担，降低了伙食质量。食堂工作人员因为怕“贴本”，又设法牟取利润，把饭、菜的数量和质量降低，变相提高饭、菜价格，伙食成本一般都提高了15％到30％。如昆明机床厂食堂赚钱很多，除用514.27元盖马厩外，到四月底还结存11，658.58元。又如吉林省建筑公司规定职工食堂每月要提取利润1，200元，食堂就提出每天为四十元的利润而奋斗。
    四、一般工矿区、林区、地质勘探单位、盐区、铁路新线及某些城市，在副食品及日用百货的供应方面也存在着问题，一般是数量少、品种少、质量差、价钱高。在某些商业部门中还存在着“利润少不干、麻烦不干、交通不便不干”的错误思想。
    五，目前我国的托儿事业也赶不上需要。解放后托儿所事业发展很快，现在已有托儿所、哺乳室6，902所，收托儿童190，000余人。宿舍、街道托儿站也发展很多。但是，离实际需要还相差很远，在广大的中小企业、机关、学校尚未基本解决女职工孩子的寄托问题。有些女职工因此不能上班，即使上班也不能安心工作。近一两年来，某些托儿所收费也有所增加。如齐齐哈尔火电三公司托儿所全部费用都由女工负担，每个儿童每月交费40元。邮电系统在去年8月后，每个孩子每月交费普遍提高1至8元。
    根据中共中央关怀职工生活的精神，在国务院的支持下，不久以前中华全国总工会召开了全国工会劳动保险、生活住宅工作会议，并且有各省、市人民委员会和中共各省市委员会所派的代表参加。这次会议上研究了当前职工生活中存在的问题，并且在各方面的支持和帮助下，拟定了解决这些问题的具体建议，拟提请国务院采纳施行。
    必须指出，由于国民党反动统治时期职工生活住宅条件过于恶劣，虽然解放后有了显著的改善，但这一些遗留下来的问题还不能马上全部解决。此外，在我国经济建设的发展中也产生了一些新的问题，有些问题也不是在短期内一下子就可以解决的。但是其中绝大部分的问题是应当迅速解决也可能解决的。这些问题之所以产生，主要是由于某些企业领导人员和工会组织对于中共中央一再指示的在增加生产的基础上逐步改善职工生活的方针贯彻得不够，存在着不关心职工生活的偏向。这种偏向可以归结为两方面：一是官僚主义的思想作风，一是资本主义的思想作风。官僚主义思想作风的主要表现是满足于已有的成绩，不去了解群众的生活情况；或者把生产和生活对立起来，片面地认为“生产事大，生活事小”。在这种思想作风支配下，职工生活中的许多问题本来是可以解决的而没有得到解决。例如住宅、食堂等本来是组织工人生产劳动所必需具备的生活条件，在进行建设时国家也规定了一定的投资，同时还有企业奖励金等可以使用，但是有些部门和企业在进行建设时没有有计划地进行这些方面的建设，甚至把国家建筑工人住宅的投资用去建筑办公室，修马路，结果是住宅和食堂的不足现象越来越严重。资本主义的思想作风主要表现在牟利热情太高，漠视群众生活。例如城市交通、自来水等公用事业，本来应以服务人民、服务生产为经营方针，应当在提高服务质量、加强管理的前提下增加收入，但是有的单位却只单纯地追求利润，一再涨价，因而加重了职工的负担。甚至医疗卫生、职工食堂等事业也牟取高额利润，这是极端错误的。官僚主义和资本主义的思想作风是严重地危害职工切身利益的，是造成当前职工生活中困难问题长期存在的根本原因。
    职工群众生活困难问题的真正解决，关键在于克服不关心职工群众切身利益的官僚主义和资本主义的思想作风。事实证明，只要企业领导人员、工会组织和有关方面对职工生活问题加以重视，那末，职工生活困难问题就等于解决了大半。因此，我们希望国民经济部门和各企业单位，把职工生活住宅问题作一次检查和适当的安排，在规划生产的同时，把职工生活也加以规划，并且设立管理职工生活福利、住宅建筑的专门机构；在工厂企业中须有专责副厂长负责管理职工生活福利和住宅建设工作，克服目前对职工生活福利无人负责现象。并且，我们建议，各企业中普遍订签集体合同，以便能对生产、工资、劳动保护、职工生活福利、推广先进经验、提高工人技术水平以及巩固劳动纪律等问题，采取具体措施。这不仅有利于改进产品质量，降低成本，进一步提高劳动生产率，全面完成国家计划的各项指标，而且可以更好地利用国家用于改善安全卫生条件和福利设施的拨款，按照必要与可能的原则有计划有步骤地提高职工的物质生活和文化生活水平。
    此外，我们建议：有关方面采取措施，合理地解决职工的房租问题；城市的公用事业特别是和职工生活关系密切的水、电、交通企业也应采取措施，有计划地减少管理费用，降低成本，以减少消费者的负担；医药卫生部门适当调整药价，取消住院押金之类的不合理制度，以减轻职工疾病医疗方面的负担；商业部门不断改善经营管理，有计划地扩大和调整商业网，合理调整商品价格，以保证厂矿企业职工，特别是生活十分艰苦的林区职工、勘测钻探人员、铁路新线工程人员及其他野外活动人员的物质供应。
    关于职工生活问题，我们工会组织负有很大责任。这几年来我们对于职工的生活没有给予足够的关切，很少及时地向有关方面提出解决职工困难的具体建议，也很少向违反党和国家的政策法令、损害群众利益的现象进行严肃的斗争，因而工会组织发生了脱离群众的现象。因此，工会组织应当切实改进工作作风，克服官僚主义倾向，深入群众倾听群众意见，了解群众的情绪和要求，协助有关方面满足职工的要求。只有这样，才能广泛深入地开展先进生产者运动，全面贯彻又多、又快、又好、又省和安全生产的方针，不断地提高劳动生产率。我们应当努力改善职工的生活状况，来高度地发挥职工的积极性和创造性，为实现1956年国家预算，为提前完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗。
