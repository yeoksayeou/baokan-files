Peace Negotiations or Continued War?

The calls from around the world to end the bloodshed in Algeria are growing louder. On June 18th, thirteen countries from the Asian-African group at the United Nations once again proposed that the United Nations Security Council immediately discuss the Algerian issue. This shows that people of all countries believe that the situation in Algeria has developed to an extremely serious point and must be resolved quickly. Unfortunately, up to now, the French government has not shown a satisfactory response to the solemn calls of such broad international public opinion.

French government leaders have stated more than once that the Algerian issue should be resolved through negotiations rather than by force. Recently, both the Algerian Communist Party and the Algerian National Liberation Front have publicly expressed their willingness to negotiate with France. Therefore, if the French government is truly willing to hold negotiations with representatives of Algeria to resolve the problem, the door to negotiations is open. Fair-minded public opinion in all countries believes that the five-point proposal put forward by the Indian government on May 22 is the correct way to restore peace in Algeria. This proposal urges France to end its violent actions and hold direct negotiations with representatives of Algeria based on the recognition of Algeria's national entity and personality. However, the French government authorities rejected it outright, using the excuse that they were unwilling to "introduce a third party into the situation." This attitude of the French government can only be seen as a lack of sincerity in peacefully resolving the Algerian issue on a reasonable basis.

The recent actions of the French authorities in Algeria are also far from consistent with its stated hope for a ceasefire and negotiations, and can only show that it still wants to rely on force to subdue the Algerian people who are demanding independence. In the past half-month, the French colonial army has launched successive large-scale military offensives against the Algerian People's Armed Forces; and in the "sweeps" and "encirclements" it has adopted even more brutal methods than in the past. Tens of thousands of reinforcements are still flowing into Algeria. The French government is also preparing to levy new taxes to pay for military expenditures in Algeria. All these measures taken by the French government have nothing in common with a sincere desire to restore peace in Algeria.

One cannot help but ask: What good can this approach of the French government ultimately bring to France? If some figures in the French government are still fantasizing today that the Algerian people will succumb to France's policy of force, then they are too subjective and forgetful, and they will eventually have to return from beautiful fantasies to painful reality. An Arab proverb says it well: "When a horse in the desert finds water, no rein can hold it back." No amount of violence can ever make the awakened Algerian people abandon their demands for independence and self-determination. The more frantically the colonial army carries out barbaric repression, the more the resistance force of the oppressed people will grow and strengthen, and the more determined they will be to strive for independence. This is a truth that has long been proven in Indochina, and it is also a truth that has been proven by the actual struggle in Algeria for more than a year. Sooner or later, the French colonialists will have to admit that, as in Indochina, military suppression is very uneconomical and does not yield good results in Algeria.

The French government's persistent policy of suppression on the Algerian issue has already seriously damaged France's national interests. The dirty colonial war costs France a large number of lives and resources every day, while greatly affecting France's international prestige. People of all countries strongly condemn France's current policy in Algeria. Formal statements issued by many Asian and African countries, solemn appeals from various international organizations, and demonstrations and protest movements held by the masses of people in various countries all show that all people who uphold justice and love peace resolutely oppose what France is doing in Algeria. The French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, said not long ago that France's military operations in Algeria were met with "opposition from almost the entire world," which is quite true. Only the North African colonial group hopes to continue the war. Only the American colonialists with ulterior motives are encouraging France to intensify its military actions, just as it once encouraged and "supported" the French colonialists in Indochina. Will the French government listen to the faithful advice of the people of all countries? Or will it willingly act as a very disgraceful tool of colonial forces to the end? It is time for French politicians to make a wise choice.

On June 17, Premier Mollet stated that his government was prepared to authorize "necessary contacts" with the Algerian resistance movement in order to achieve a ceasefire. If this means that the French government is beginning to consider changing its policy of force and is willing to recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination in order to seek the restoration of peace in Algeria, then Premier Mollet's statement is welcome. But if the "contacts" Mollet speaks of are merely intended to induce the Algerian people to lay down their arms and accept French conditions, while military suppression continues, then his words are nothing more than a deception, and deception will eventually be exposed.

### 和平谈判还是继续战争？

    和平谈判还是继续战争？
    从世界各地发出的要求结束阿尔及利亚流血事件的呼声是愈来愈响亮了。六月十八日，联合国亚非集团的十三个国家又提出建议，要求联合国安全理事会立即讨论阿尔及利亚问题。这说明各国人民都认为阿尔及利亚的局势已发展到了极为严重的地步，必须迅速求得解决。但是遗憾的是，一直到现在为止，法国政府对于这样广泛的国际舆论的严正呼声还没有表现令人满意的反应。
    法国的政府领袖曾经不止一次地宣布过，阿尔及利亚问题要通过谈判而不是依靠武力来求得解决。最近，阿尔及利亚共产党和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线都公开表示准备和法国谈判。因此，法国政府如果真是愿意同阿尔及利亚的代表举行谈判来解决问题，谈判的门是敞开着的。各国公正舆论都认为，印度政府五月二十二日提出的五点建议，是恢复阿尔及利亚和平的正确途径。这个建议敦促法国结束强暴行动，而在承认阿尔及利亚的民族实体和人格的基础上同阿尔及利亚的代表举行直接谈判。但是法国政府当局却以不愿意“把第三者引进这个局势”为借口，一口予以拒绝。法国政府的这种态度，只能够被认为是还没有诚意在合理的基础上和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    法国当局最近在阿尔及利亚的做法，也远不符合于它所表示的愿意停火和谈判的希望，而只能说明它还想依靠武力来压服要求独立的阿尔及利亚人民。近半个月来，法国殖民军队接连向阿尔及利亚人民武装部队发动大规模军事进攻；而且在“扫荡”和“围剿”当中采用了比过去更加残暴的手段。数以万计的援军还在源源开往阿尔及利亚。法国政府还准备征收新税来支付在阿尔及利亚的军事开支。法国政府所采取的这一切措施，同恢复阿尔及利亚和平的真诚愿望没有丝毫共同之处。
    人们不禁要问：法国政府这种作法究竟能给法国带来什么好处呢？法国政府中的某些人物如果到今天还在幻想着阿尔及利亚人民会在法国的武力政策面前屈服，那末也未免过于主观和健忘了，他们终将不得不从美妙的幻想回到痛苦的现实中来。阿拉伯人的一句谚语说得好：“当沙漠中的马发觉有水的时候，任何缰绳都不能把它勒住。”任何强暴手段都绝对不能使已经觉醒的阿尔及利亚人民放弃他们独立和自决的要求。殖民军队愈是疯狂地实行野蛮的镇压，被压迫人民的反抗力量将愈加成长壮大，他们争取独立的决心将愈加坚强。这是在印度支那早经证明了的真理，也是阿尔及利亚一年多来斗争的实际所证明了的真理。法国殖民主义者迟早终要承认，在阿尔及利亚也和在印度支那一样，军事镇压是很不合算和得不到好结果的。
    法国政府在阿尔及利亚问题上迄今固执镇压政策，已经使法国的民族利益受到了严重的损害。肮脏的殖民战争每日耗费了法国大量的生命和资财，同时大大影响了法国的国际威望。各国人民严厉谴责法国目前在阿尔及利亚奉行的政策。许多亚非国家发表的正式声明，各种国际组织发出的庄严呼吁，各国人民群众举行的示威抗议运动，都表明了一切崇奉正义和爱好和平的人们，都坚决反对法国在阿尔及利亚的所作所为。法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特不久以前说：法国在阿尔及利亚的军事行动遭到了“几乎全世界的反对”，这是说得一点也不错的。只有北非殖民集团希望把战争继续进行下去。只有心怀叵测的美国殖民主义者怂恿法国加紧采取军事行动，正像它曾经在印度支那怂恿和“支持”过法国殖民主义者一样。法国政府是听取各国人民的忠言呢？还是甘愿充当很不光彩的殖民主义势力的工具到底呢？法国的政治家是作出明智的抉择的时候了。
    摩勒总理六月十七日表示：他的政府准备授权同阿尔及利亚抵抗运动进行“必要的接触”，以便实现停火。如果这是意味着法国政府开始考虑改变它的武力政策，愿意承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利，以谋求恢复阿尔及利亚的和平，那末摩勒总理的表示是值得欢迎的。但是如果摩勒所说的“接触”不过是想诱迫阿尔及利亚人民放下武器，接受法国的条件，而军事镇压仍然继续进行，那末他的这些话就不过是一种欺骗，而欺骗是终究会被揭穿的。
