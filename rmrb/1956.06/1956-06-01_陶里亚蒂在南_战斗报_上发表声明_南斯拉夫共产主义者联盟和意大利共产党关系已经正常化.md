Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 31st - Belgrade Dispatch: Today, the Yugoslavian newspaper "Borba" published a statement by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party. Togliatti stated that his visit to Yugoslavia was to normalize relations between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Italian Communist Party. He said that this normalization has been achieved.

Togliatti said that Tito and other Yugoslav leaders he had met had received him with comradely and most gracious hospitality and fraternal warmth. He also said, "Comrade Tito first expressed the desire to normalize relations between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Italian socialist movement, and provided us with great possibilities to complete this matter as soon as possible."

Togliatti announced that it had been decided to send some members of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party to visit Yugoslavia in order to gain a broad understanding of the actual situation in Yugoslavia. He hoped that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia would send a delegation to Italy to understand the activities of the Italian Communist Party. Togliatti said that after doing so, there would be several other possibilities to develop cooperation between the two parties. There are indeed many things that can be done in establishing possible closer cooperation.

Togliatti recalled that errors had been made against Yugoslavia in the past, and these errors damaged relations between the Yugoslav Communist Party and other parties. He believes that it is not enough to merely admit mistakes, but it is also necessary to become familiar with the reality of Yugoslavia. Direct contact must be established with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in order to understand and study the situation in Yugoslavia, especially its economic and social reality.

Togliatti emphasized that we have seen significant changes in Yugoslavia's economic and social life. Yugoslavia's path to socialism is a new one, and for this reason, a comprehensive study of the path taken by Yugoslavia is needed.

Togliatti also spoke about his impressions of his visit to Yugoslavia, pointing out that Yugoslavia has done a lot of work in developing democratic economic and social factors.

Togliatti went on to say that the changes taking place in Yugoslavia are very important to us, also because of the special position that Yugoslavia occupies on the world stage.

On the same day, "Borba" published an article entitled "Beneficial Contacts," saying that the restoration of ties between the Italian Communist Party and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is an important event that should be welcomed. The article expressed confidence that the direct contact established between the Italian Communist Party and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will have a positive impact on the development of good neighborly relations between the two countries.

    陶里亚蒂在南“战斗报”上发表声明
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和意大利共产党关系已经正常化
    新华社布拉格31日电　贝尔格莱德消息：今天的南斯拉夫“战斗报”发表了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂的一篇声明。陶里亚蒂说，他到南斯拉夫访问是为了使南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和意大利共产党之间的关系正常化。他说，这种正常化已经实现了。
    陶里亚蒂说，铁托以及他曾经接触到的其他南斯拉夫领导人，都以同志式的最殷勤的招待和兄弟般的热诚接待了他。他还说：“铁托同志首先表示了使南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和意大利社会主义运动之间关系正常化的愿望，并且向我们提供了尽快完成这件事的巨大可能性。”
    陶里亚蒂宣布，已经决定派遣意大利共产党中央委员会的一些委员访问南斯拉夫，以便广泛地了解南斯拉夫的实际情况。他希望南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟派遣一个代表团到意大利去了解意大利共产党的活动情况。陶里亚蒂说，在这样作了以后，就会有其他若干可能来发展两个党之间的合作。在建立可能的更密切的合作方面的确有很多事情可以作。
    陶里亚蒂追述说，早些时曾经对南斯拉夫犯了错误，这些错误破坏了南斯拉夫共产党和其他党之间的关系。他认为，仅仅承认错误还是不够的，还需要熟悉南斯拉夫的现实情况。必须同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟建立直接的接触，以便了解和研究南斯拉夫的情况，首先是它的经济社会现实情况。
    陶里亚蒂着重指出，我们看到南斯拉夫的经济和社会生活有了重大的改变。南斯拉夫走向社会主义道路的方式是新的方式，正因为这样，所以需要对南斯拉夫所走的道路作全面的研究。
    陶里亚蒂还谈到了他访问南斯拉夫的观感，他指出南斯拉夫在发展民主的经济社会因素方面做了很多工作。
    陶里亚蒂接着说，在南斯拉夫发生的改变对我们之所以非常重要，也是由于南斯拉夫在世界舞台上所占有的特殊地位。
    在同一天，“战斗报”以“有益的接触”为题发表文章说，意大利共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间联系的恢复，是一件应该受到欢迎的重要事件。文章表示相信，意大利共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间建立的直接接触，将对两国善邻关系的发展起着良好的影响。
