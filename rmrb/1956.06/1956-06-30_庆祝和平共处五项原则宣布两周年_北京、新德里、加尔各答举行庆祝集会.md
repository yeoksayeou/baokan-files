Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: "The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have set a good example for international friendly relations and have become the norm for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems." Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, made this statement at a cocktail party tonight to celebrate the second anniversary of the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma on the Five Principles.

　　The cocktail party, attended by more than 200 prominent figures from all walks of life in China, was held in a hall of the CPPCC Auditorium. Just over two months ago, the first anniversary of the victory of the Bandung Spirit of the Asian-African Conference was celebrated here. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known as "Panchsheel," which are being celebrated today, were announced two years ago and were developed into the famous Ten Principles at the Bandung Conference more than a year ago. Today, a year after the Bandung Conference, its influence has far exceeded the scope of Asian and African countries and has been accepted by many European countries as a fundamental guideline for international relations.

　　In the hall decorated with potted plants and flowers, Chinese government ministers and vice ministers, heads of various people's organizations, and people from all walks of life were engaged in cordial conversations with friends from India and Burma. Indian Ambassador to China, Nehru, was one of the first guests to arrive. Vice Premier Chen Yi, upon entering the hall, toasted "Panchsheel" with him. When Burmese Ambassador to China, Wu La Mao, appeared at the venue, Vice Premier Chen Yi congratulated him on this great festival. Ambassador Wu La Mao replied with a smile, saying that the seeds of the Five Principles cultivated by China, India, and Burma have now spread to the whole world. As they talked together, the hall was filled with laughter as people toasted "Panchsheel."

　　The atmosphere of the cocktail party grew increasingly warm and lively. At this moment, Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, raised his glass, walked to the microphone, and said that the Five Principles announced two years ago were a milestone in the development of international friendly relations, and that this day would become a festival for the whole world to celebrate international friendship. He proposed a toast to the Five Principles and to this festival of international friendship.

　　Zheng Zhenduo, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, then proposed a toast to this historic festival and to Sino-Burmese friendship.

　　After Ambassador Nehru and Ambassador Wu La Mao raised their glasses to celebrate the festival and to congratulate the friendship between China, India, and Burma, as well as the health of the leaders of the three countries, Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out in his speech that the spirit of the Five Principles has been endorsed by more and more countries, and he proposed a toast to the greater development of the Five Principles.

　　A cultural evening was held after the cocktail party.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 29th: A rally was held in the Indian capital on the evening of June 28th to celebrate the second anniversary of the joint declaration of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by the Prime Ministers of China and India.

　　The rally was organized by the Panchsheel Day Celebration Committee at the Constitution Club Hall in New Delhi, and was chaired by Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Committee for Solidarity with Asia.

　　Mrs. Nehru said: "I believe that the only way to achieve world peace is through the principles contained in the Panchsheel declaration issued by the Prime Ministers of India and China.

　　Referring to the recent easing of world tensions, Mrs. Nehru welcomed the actions of the Soviet Union and other countries in reducing their armed forces and defense budgets, and expressed her belief that disarmament would soon be achieved worldwide.

　　She concluded: "The principles of peaceful coexistence will soon be realized throughout the world, and the result will be greater prosperity and the achievement of world peace."

　　Chinese Ambassador Pan Zili spoke amidst sustained applause, congratulating the Indian people and Prime Minister Nehru on this day. He expressed his hope for greater cooperation between the two countries to promote the cause of peaceful coexistence, which has already achieved a great victory.

　　Sunderlal, representing the Indo-China Friendship Association and the All-India Peace Council, expressed support for the work of promoting Panchsheel, and stressed the need to act in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence, recognizing the current political, economic, social, and ideological differences between countries.
