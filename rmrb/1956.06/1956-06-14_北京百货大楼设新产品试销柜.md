Xinhua News Agency, June 12th—Customers who came to the Beijing Wangfujing Department Store today almost all visited the new product trial sales counter that was just set up on the third floor. In the twelve large glass cabinets, more than sixty new knitted and cotton textile products shipped from Shanghai were displayed. The establishment of this type of trial sales counter is to help production departments solicit consumers' opinions.

In front of the glass cabinets displaying various colored linen and poplin fabrics, customers scrambled to select their favorite varieties. Three young female students from the Beijing Radio Industry School were discussing a kind of green linen, which was simple, elegant, and inexpensive. They each bought this kind of material and also suggested that the production department produce a white linen suitable for making summer shirts.

Customers also offered criticisms on some products with poor varieties and colors.

    北京百货大楼设新产品试销柜
    据新华社12日讯　今天来北京王府井百货大楼的顾客，几乎每个人都参观了三楼刚刚设置的新产品试销柜。在十二个大玻璃柜里陈列了六十多种从上海运来的针织、棉织新产品。设置这种试销柜，是为了帮助生产部门征求消费者的意见。
    在陈列着各种色素麻纱、府绸的玻璃柜前，顾客们争相挑选他们喜爱的品种。北京无线电工业学校的三个年轻的女学生在谈论着一种绿色的麻纱，素雅大方，价钱便宜。她们每人都买了这种料子，还建议生产部门再生产一种适宜夏季做衬衫的白色麻纱。
    顾客们也对一些品种、花色不好的产品提出了批评意见。
