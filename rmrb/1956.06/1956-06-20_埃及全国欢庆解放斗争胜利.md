    Egypt Nationally Celebrates Victory in the Liberation Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, June 19th, Cairo: Amidst the cheers of jubilant Egyptians on June 18th, Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser, beaming, raised the Egyptian flag on the roof of the former British Naval Club in Port Said.
    This marked the official end of the British army's seventy-four-year occupation of the Suez Canal Zone. The Naval Club was the last facility occupied by British forces before their withdrawal. The last batch of British troops had already left Egyptian soil five days earlier.
    The flag-raising ceremony also marked the beginning of large-scale celebrations by the Egyptian people. They celebrated their liberation from foreign occupation, and also the third anniversary of the abolition of the monarchy and the proclamation of the Republic of Egypt on this day. The celebrations will continue for several days. It has been announced that June 18th and 19th will be national holidays.
    Many foreign guests are participating in the Egyptian people's celebrations. The Egyptian people welcomed the arrival of Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov with great joy. Delegations from Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Sudan, Yemen, and Tunisia also arrived in Cairo. Former British Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Suez Canal Zone, Robertson, also attended the ceremony on behalf of Britain.
    After raising the flag, Abdel Nasser said that this was an unforgettable moment, a moment that Egyptians had dreamed of for a long time. He said: "Citizens, we pray to Allah that no other flag shall ever fly on our land." He then lit a torch, which will be carried by two hundred and fifty athletes to the Egyptian capital, Cairo.
    Cairo is a festive sight. Arches and colorful models celebrating the withdrawal of British troops and symbolizing Egyptian independence have been erected on the city's streets. Flags and banners are flying everywhere.
    Newspapers published editorials celebrating the holiday and published special editions containing articles describing the Egyptian people's struggle for freedom and independence, and the achievements of Egypt under the leadership of the Abdel Nasser government.
    "People's Newspaper" published an interview with Abdel Nasser by a reporter from the newspaper. He said that Egypt maintains neutrality between the East and West. Egypt is willing to fight against imperialism, atomic bombs, racial discrimination, and interference in the internal affairs of other countries. He said that the struggles that Egypt must currently undertake include building a society based on cooperative socialism, developing agriculture and industry, and strengthening the independent Arab group and its defense.
    At the same time, celebrations were also held throughout the rest of Egypt. Flags were also flying everywhere in the city of Alexandria. Alexandria University held a ceremony to unveil a monument to commemorate the students of the university who sacrificed themselves in the struggle to demand the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone.

    埃及全国欢庆解放斗争胜利
    新华社19日讯　开罗消息：六月十八日，在狂欢的埃及人的欢呼声中，埃及总理阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔满面笑容地在塞得港前英国海军俱乐部的屋顶上升起了埃及国旗。
    这标志着英国军队在苏彝士运河区的七十四年的占领的正式结束。海军俱乐部是英军撤离以前所占用的最后一处设施。五天以前，最后一批英军已经离开了埃及土地。
    这个升旗典礼也是埃及人民大规模庆祝活动的开始。他们庆祝从外国占领下解放出来，同时也庆祝在三年前这一天，废止君主政体，宣布埃及共和国的成立。庆祝活动将继续数日。已经宣布，六月十八日和十九日全国放假。
    参加埃及人民的庆祝活动的有许多外国来宾。埃及人民怀着极大的愉快心情欢迎苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫的来到。到达开罗的还有叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、约旦、苏丹、也门和突尼斯等国的代表团。前驻苏彝士运河区英军司令罗伯逊也代表英国参加典礼。
    在升旗以后，阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔说，这是一个终生难忘的时刻，埃及人一直梦想着这个时刻的来临。他说：“公民们，我们祈求真主，禁止任何其他国旗飘扬在我们的国土上。”随后，他点着了一个火炬，这个火炬将由二百五十名运动员传递到埃及首都开罗去。
    开罗是一片节日景象。市内各条街道上架起了彩楼和庆祝英军撤退以及象征埃及独立的彩色模型。到处飘扬着旗帜，以及许多横幅标语。
    各报都发表社论庆祝这个节日，并且出版了特刊，刊载叙述埃及人民争取自由和独立的斗争以及埃及在阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔政府领导下取得的成就的文章。
    “人民报”刊载了阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔对这家报纸的记者发表的谈话。他说，埃及在东西双方之间保持中立。埃及愿意为了反对帝国主义、原子弹、种族歧视和干涉别国内政而战斗。他说，埃及当前必须进行的斗争中，包括建立一个在合作制的社会主义的基础上的社会，发展农业和工业，以及加强独立的阿拉伯集团和它的防御。
    同时埃及全国其他各地也在举行庆祝活动。亚历山大港城内也是到处飘扬着旗帜。亚历山大大学举行了一个纪念碑的揭幕典礼，这个纪念碑是为了纪念在为要求英军退出苏彝士运河区而进行的斗争中牺牲的这个大学的学生。
