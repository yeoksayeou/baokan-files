Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant Should Not Oppose Rational Transportation of Tong Weiyuan

In the first quarter of this year, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant was responsible for transporting tens of thousands of tons of ore from the Gushan and Nanshan iron mines, which it sold, to Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Anshan Iron and Steel Company also shipped a large amount of coke. According to the state's principles of rational transportation, using shipping could save more than 330,000 yuan in transportation costs and save more than 13 million ton-kilometers of transportation capacity (equivalent to 13,000 tons of goods being transported back and forth over a distance of 1,000 li), and also reduce empty northbound ships and rationally utilize the state's vehicle and ship transportation forces. The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant was not very interested in this matter, which was beneficial to the state, and raised a series of "difficulties" and created various obstacles in the process of resolving the use of shipping.

In February of this year, representatives from the shipping department went to Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant to negotiate shipping matters. This plant raised four major problems on behalf of the cargo-using unit: shipping could not be loaded separately according to the 300-ton assay, funds could not be allocated by the bank after ore shipping, the particle size of the ore could not be guaranteed, and the shipping time was too long to guarantee supply. If the cargo-using unit agreed to shipping, "they" had no objections. It seemed that the problem was with the cargo-using unit, not the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant. Therefore, representatives from the shipping department went from Jiangnan to Northeast. As a result, the cargo-using unit agreed to shipping and sent representatives to Ma'anshan to sign a transportation agreement.

Everyone thought the problem was solved, but that was not the case: Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant raised new difficulties: Ma'anshan had no site for water transportation. In fact, Ma'anshan Port was not without sites for water transportation, but a large number of sites for water transportation were occupied as material yards. Although transshipment of ore at Nanjing Port was a waste, there was no other choice but to transship at Nanjing Port. The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant was not willing to let the problem be solved in this way and told the representative of the cargo-using unit: "Inland river transportation cannot guarantee the completion of the task," forcing the representative of the cargo-using unit to not dare to transship the ore at Nanjing Port, forcing the Wuhu Inland River Shipping Bureau to make an absolute guarantee.

After this problem was solved, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant raised four new problems: not submitting monthly consignment plans according to the program approved by the State Council; not paying fines to each other according to the regulations approved by the State Council; the cargo-using unit had to bear an additional 6 jiao per ton for dumping fees; ore would be assayed at Nanjing Port after the water rose. They demanded a reply within ten minutes, otherwise, shipping would not be used. The person in charge of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant was confident that this would "trap" the shipping department and the cargo-using unit. What was the actual situation? After solving the consignment plan problem and the fine payment problem, everyone went to the site and found that the assay was not affected by the rising water and did not require dumping fees. Under these circumstances, the responsible comrades of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant agreed to ship Gushan ore. However, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant was not willing to give up and used the time to sign the transportation agreement to concentrate ore at the Dangtu Railway Station, creating a fait accompli that the ore had to be transported by rail.

When studying the shipping of Nanshan ore, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant forced the shipping department representatives to agree at the beginning: "After solving the Nanshan problem, guarantee not to talk about the water transport of coke, otherwise, the Nanshan problem will not be solved!" Then, they proposed that shipping Nanshan ore must have a site of 8,000 to 10,000 square meters, but this site did not exist. After the cargo-using unit and the shipping department representative jointly calculated, they believed that only a site of 1,000 square meters was needed, and this site was found. The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant immediately stated that it would cost 6,000 yuan (actually only about 1,000 yuan) to transport the waste ore powder stored on the site, which must be borne by the cargo-using unit. Because this problem could not be solved, Nanshan ore and coke still cannot be transported by water.

Why did the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant try every possible means to oppose shipping ore and coke? Peng, the chief of the transportation section of this plant, repeatedly said: "The water transport department is trying to get business, the cargo-using unit is trying to save money, what is the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant trying to do? Losing both the lady and the army!" Here, it is necessary to analyze what "lady" and "army" refer to? It turned out that: after switching to shipping, it was necessary to reorganize the loading and unloading forces, reorganize the dispatch of small trains, and redo the site plan, and this work was a bit more troublesome than using rail transport. They were unwilling to be a little more troublesome, in Peng's words, they were unwilling to "lose the lady" and "lose the army," so they opposed things that were beneficial to the country. I think the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant has adopted a kind of departmentalism attitude towards shipping ore and coke, and I hope that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry will quickly help the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant change this attitude!

### 马鞍山铁厂不应该反对合理运输童维源

    马鞍山铁厂不应该反对合理运输童维源
    今年第一季度，马鞍山铁厂负责把卖出的姑山、南山铁矿的矿石几万吨运交鞍山钢铁公司，还由鞍山钢铁公司运来大量焦炭。这些货物，按照国家合理运输原则，利用航运，可节省运输费用三十三万多元，节省运力一千三百多万吨公里（等于一万三千多吨货物在一千华里运输距离上往返一次），还可减少北上船舶空驶，合理使用国家车船运输力量。这件对国家有利的事情，马鞍山铁厂十分不感兴趣，在解决利用航运问题过程中，提出一系列“困难”，制造种种障碍。
    今年二月，航运部门派代表赴马鞍山铁厂商洽航运事宜。这个厂代替用货单位提出了四大问题：航运不能按化验三百吨分开装运，矿石航运以后不能在银行拨款，也不能保证矿石的粒度，航运时间长不能保证供应。若是用货单位同意航运，“他们”没有任何意见。这样看来，问题在用货单位，不在马鞍山铁厂。于是航运部门的代表，从江南到东北。结果用货单位同意航运，并且派代表同往马鞍山签订运输协议。
    大家满以为问题解决了，其实不然：马鞍山铁厂又提出新的困难：马鞍山无供水运用的场地。其实马鞍山港不是没有供水运用的场地，而是大量供水运用的场地被当作材料场占用了。虽然矿石在南京港转运是浪费的，但是事出无奈，也只好在南京港转运了。马鞍山铁厂却不甘心问题就这样解决，又对用货单位代表说：“内河运输不能保证完成任务”，使用货单位代表不敢把矿石在南京港转运，逼得芜湖内河航运局作了绝对的保证。
    这个问题解决以后，马鞍山铁厂又提出了四个新问题：不按国务院批准的计划程序提月度托运计划；不按国务院批准的规定相互计缴罚款；用货单位须再负担每吨倒堆费六角；水涨后矿石在南京港化验。限十分钟内答复，否则即不用航运。马鞍山铁厂的负责人满以为这样就可以把航运部门和用货单位“卡”住了。实际怎样呢？解决了托运计划问题、计缴罚款问题以后，大家到现场一看，发现化验既不受水涨影响，也不需要倒堆费。在这种场合下，马鞍山铁厂的负责同志才同意航运姑山矿石。可是马鞍山铁厂却不甘心从此罢休，利用签订运输协议的时间，竭力向当涂火车站集中矿石，造成矿石不得不用铁路运输的既成事实。
    在研究南山矿石航运的时候，马鞍山铁厂一开头就逼着航运部门代表同意：“解决南山问题后，保证不谈焦炭的水运问题，不然，就不解决南山问题！”接着，他们又提出航运南山矿石，必须有一个八千到一万平方公尺的场地，但是这块场地没有。用货单位和航运部门代表共同计算后，认为只要一千平方公尺场地就可以了，并且找到了这块场地。马鞍山铁厂立即又表示运出存在该场上的废矿粉需款六千元（实际仅需一千元左右），必须由用货单位负担。因为这个问题解决不了，南山矿石、焦炭迄今还不能用水运。
    马鞍山铁厂为什么千方百计地反对航运矿石和焦炭呢？这个厂运输科彭科长一再说道：“水运部门为了拉生意，用货单位为了节省，马鞍山铁厂为了什么？赔了夫人又折兵！”在这里，需要分析一下“夫人”和“兵”是指什么？原来是：改为航运以后，需要重新组织装卸力量，重新组织小火车的调度工作，重新做场地计划，而这点工作比起用铁路运输来要麻烦一点。他们不愿意麻烦一点，用彭科长的话说，就是不愿“赔夫人”和“折兵”，所以就反对对国家有利的事情。我认为马鞍山铁厂对航运矿石和焦炭所采取的是一种本位主义的态度，希望冶金工业部迅速帮助马鞍山铁厂改变这种态度！
