    More Than Two Thousand Advanced Producers in Beijing to Recuperate in Beidaihe and the Summer Palace in Stages
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The annual recuperation season for advanced producers in Beijing has arrived. The Beidaihe and Summer Palace sanatoriums affiliated with the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions have already begun receiving recuperating workers in stages. The second group of advanced producers going to Beidaihe for recuperation left Beijing on the 12th. The Summer Palace sanatorium has already begun receiving the fourth group of recuperating workers. This year, the advanced producers who have recuperated in the Summer Palace and Beidaihe have generally gained two or three kilograms in weight. Now, they are throwing themselves into the motherland's production and construction with even greater enthusiasm.
    This year, a total of 2,480 advanced producers in Beijing will go to Beidaihe or the Summer Palace for recuperation, more than three times the 600 people who recuperated last year. In addition to advanced figures and veteran skilled workers from the industrial front, this year's recuperation quota has especially increased the number of university professors and senior scientific and technical personnel. In July and August, 400 professors, lecturers, and outstanding primary and secondary school teachers will spend their summer vacation at the Beidaihe seaside.

    北京将有两千多先进生产者
    分期到北戴河和颐和园休养
    本报讯　北京市先进生产者一年一度的休养季节到来了，北京市工会联合会所属的北戴河和颐和园工人休养所都已经开始分期接待休养员。第二期到北戴河休养的先进生产者已经在十二日离开北京。颐和园休养所已经开始接待第四期的休养员。今年在颐和园和北戴河休养过的先进生产者，体重一般都增加了二、三公斤。现在，他们正以更加饱满的情绪投入祖国的生产建设。
    今年北京市共要有二千四百八十名先进生产者前往北戴河或颐和园休养，比去年全市六百人休养多三倍多。今年的休养员中，除了工业战线上的先进人物和老年技工以外，特别增加了大学教授和高级科学技术人员的休养名额。七、八月间，全市将有四百名教授、讲师和优秀的中、小学教师前往北戴河海滨渡过暑假。
