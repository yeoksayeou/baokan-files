    Increase in Juvenile Crime in the United States
    The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's April report, based on surveys of 1,477 cities, stated that 42.3% of serious crime offenders last year were under the age of eighteen, and among these juvenile offenders, 47.9% were under fifteen years old.
    The situation regarding children's drug use is also serious. American police uncovered a child drug trafficking organization where all the drug users were boys and girls, the oldest being only seventeen. A report by the U.S. Senate Narcotics Subcommittee stated that teenagers currently account for 13% of drug addicts.
    The February issue of "Time" magazine also stated that an average of 200,000 teenagers suffer from venereal disease each year.
    Recently, in New York City, where juvenile crime is most severe, the city council requested the passage of a bill to fine the parents of juvenile offenders $250 to ensure parents strictly discipline their children. However, New York State Governor Harriman vetoed the bill, saying, "Mischievous children will not hesitate to use this weapon to threaten their parents."
      Deteriorating Education Conditions in the United States
    A report published in January by the National Education Association of the United States stated that one million children in the United States drop out of school each year. The Education Association said that there is a severe shortage of elementary school buildings in all forty-eight states in the United States, and a shortage of secondary school buildings in forty-four states. Due to the severe lack of teachers and classrooms, children are forced to crowd into dilapidated school buildings.
    The U.S. government, which spends $40 billion annually on arms expansion, has not taken effective measures to improve education. This year, the U.S. government allocated only $400 million as "aid" to education in its budget.
        The Ku Klux Klan in the United States
    According to a Western news agency: The Ku Klux Klan in the United States has recently shown new trends in development. In Florence, South Carolina, an organization of the Ku Klux Klan with 800 members held a gathering on the evening of May 19th. Many people delivered impassioned speeches at the meeting, openly clamoring for the persecution of black people and Jews. Edward, the leader of the KKK, said at the meeting: New KKK branches are located throughout the southern states of the United States, and some northern states also have branches. He even said, with extreme complacency: The United States has never been closer to civil war than it is now.

    美国儿童犯罪案件增加
    美国联邦调查局在四月份的报告中说，据1，477个城市的调查，去年重大罪案中，42.3％的罪犯是十八岁以下的少年，而在少年罪犯中，47.9％还不到十五岁。
    儿童吸毒情况也很严重。美国警察曾破获一个儿童贩毒机关，吸毒犯全部是男女儿童，最大的才不过十七岁。美国参议院麻醉剂小组委员会报告说，目前的吸毒犯青少年占13％。
    二月份一期的“时代”杂志也说，目前仅十多岁的少年，平均每年就有二十万人患花柳病。
    最近，儿童犯罪最严重的纽约市，市议会要求通过一项法案，即对儿童罪犯的父母也要罚款二百五十美元，以便使父母对儿童严加管教，但是纽约州州长哈里曼否决了这项法案，他说：“调皮的儿童会毫不犹豫地利用这项武器来威胁父母的。”
      美国的教育状况恶劣
    美国全国教育协会一月份发表的报告说，美国每年有一百万儿童失学。教育协会说，在美国所有四十八个州中都严重缺乏小学校舍，而在四十四个州也缺乏中学校舍。由于师资和教室十分缺乏，儿童们不得不拥挤在破旧的校舍里。
    每年花费四百亿美元扩充军备的美国政府没有采取有效措施来改善教育情况，今年美国政府在预算中，只拨出四亿美元作为对教育事业的“援助”。
        三K党在美国
    据一家西方通讯社说：美国的三K党最近有新的发展趋势。在南卡罗莱纳州弗罗伦斯城，有一个有八百个会员的三K党组织在五月十九日晚上举行了集会。许多人在会上发表了激烈的演说，公开叫嚣要迫害黑人和犹太人。三K党的首领爱德华在会上说：新组织的三K党支部遍布美国南部各州，而且北部有若干州也有它的支部。他甚至得意忘形地说：美国从来没有比现在更接近内战。
