Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 15th: Hebei Province has achieved an unprecedented wheat harvest. According to a survey and estimate by the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the total output of more than 32 million mu of wheat in the province this year may reach more than 4.16 billion jin, exceeding the original planned target by 6.7%, an increase of 17% compared with last year. The average yield per mu is more than 126 jin, which is also higher than the original planned target by 4.5%, an increase of 25% compared with last year. Compared with 1954, when the most wheat was planted and the highest yield was achieved after liberation, 3.5 million mu less land was cultivated this year, but 350 million more jin were harvested.

For more than ten days, millions of men and women in more than 20,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives across the province have been rushing to harvest wheat day and night with unparalleled joy. At present, the more than 10 million mu of wheat in the three special districts of Handan and Shijiazhuang in the south have mostly been harvested, and farmers in the central Baoding and Cangxian special districts and coastal areas are seizing the time to harvest.

This unprecedented wheat harvest is the first production victory in Hebei Province after basically realizing the complete socialist agricultural cooperation. Two to three times more various fertilizers, such as pen manure, human urine, pit mud, and kang soil, were added to the wheat fields in a timely manner. In addition, timely cultivation was carried out, and two or three more hoeings were done than in previous years. Irrigated wheat fields were also watered one or two more times. Before and after the wheat flowering stage, many cooperatives also carried out foliar spraying of phosphate fertilizer on some wheat fields, built windbreaks to prevent wind disasters, and did a good job in the late-stage management of wheat fields.

    河北省小麦空前丰收
    新华社保定15日电　河北省小麦空前丰收。据河北省统计局的调查估计，今年全省三千二百多万亩小麦的总产量可以达到四十一亿六千多万斤，超过原定计划指标6.7％，比去年增加17％；每亩平均产量为126斤多，也高过原定计划指标4.5％，比去年增加25％。和解放后种麦最多、产量最高的1954年相比，今年少种三百五十万亩，却多收三亿五千多万斤。
    十多天来，全省两万多个农业生产合作社的上千万男女，都以无比喜悦的心情，日夜抢收小麦。现在，南部邯郸、石家庄等三个专区的一千多万亩小麦已经大部登场，中部保定、沧县等专区和沿海地区的农民正在适时地突击收割。
    空前的小麦丰收，是河北省基本上实现全社会主义的农业合作化以后生产上的首次胜利。超过往年两三倍的圈肥、人尿、坑泥、炕土等各种肥料，适时地追加在麦田里。再加及时中耕，比往年多锄了两三次。水地麦田还多浇了一两次水。小麦扬花前后，许多社又对部分麦田实行根外喷施磷肥，搭风架预防风灾，作好了麦田的后期管理。
