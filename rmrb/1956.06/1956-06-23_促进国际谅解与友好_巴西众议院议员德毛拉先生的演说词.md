Promoting International Understanding and Friendship
Speech by Mr. de Moura, Member of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies

Mr. Chairman, Honorable Representatives:

I am extremely honored to be able to speak at the National People's Congress of China, which directly represents the people, and the people exercise the functions of the government.

This congress is a microcosm of China, because it represents all the ethnic groups that make up this great country.

I have never wished so much as at this moment that I could speak Chinese, because I now represent the members of the Brazilian Congressional delegation, who are visiting China with the mission of promoting international understanding and friendship, in addressing you.

If I were proficient in your difficult and historic language, perhaps I would be able to more fully express my thoughts from this solemn and lofty platform.

When I was a boy and a young man, the China I imagined in my mind was a magical country, filled with many legends of dragons. Our Latin temperament, rich in imagination, was attracted by your exotic temples and costumes, your unique architecture, and your beautiful scenery with its varied characteristics, from the white, icy world to the tropical scenery under your radiant and warm sun.

I was also familiar with your handicrafts, which are among the most valuable in the world. These handicrafts display the unparalleled dexterity, patience, and wisdom of your artisans, who have created veritable treasures, whether it be carved ivory, polished wood, fine porcelain, or painted long scrolls, which to this day still enhance the most famous painting galleries of any civilized country.

Your thinkers, poets, writers, philosophers, and scientists are also very famous, and many of their works are very familiar to Brazilian students.

When I came here, the China I saw was different in some respects. While not losing its traditional characteristics, especially in handicrafts, it is also engaged in a broader, deeper, and more economically significant undertaking. It is rapidly and vigorously industrializing in order to get rid of its semi-colonial economy and its status as a raw material exporting country, which is the most primitive agricultural and pastoral stage of all development stages.

The achievements you have made in the processing industry in just five or six years have amazed, excited, and inspired all other nations with the same needs.

You have not only made material progress and created consumer wealth. You have done more than that, and much more. You have enabled this country with its complex racial origins to be orderly, disciplined, and united. Your wisdom, in formulating the most modern political charter of our time, has harmoniously solved the almost unsolvable problem of ethnic minorities, a cause that inspires admiration in everyone.

The education of the people, especially the education of children and young people, has produced admirable results in various schools, universities, cultural institutions, and gymnasiums and sports fields, improving the physique of this generation and ensuring the good physique of the next generation.

This is the China I have seen, and its doors are open to all observers who have eyes to see and conscience to judge.

The form of government adopted by your revolution is not something I can judge, because it is the right of self-determination of your people. This is also a fundamental principle of good and correct international relations. But in this revolution, you are indeed creating a veritable renaissance of China.

In a country that in the past had only nominal but not de facto sovereignty, and where sovereignty could not be fully exercised, you have created a free nation, without oppressors or occupiers. Your national flag now flies over the entire unified, strong, and sovereign mainland territory of China.

I represent a country that loves freedom and democracy, and to defend freedom and democracy, it has fought outside its own territory in two wars, because it loves the independence and happiness of other peoples.

According to this tradition, Brazil, which is geographically far from China but close in friendship, has always watched with sympathy and emotion the struggles and sacrifices you have made to fully restore your sovereignty.

These facts constitute the history of China, and in speaking of these facts, I want to pay my warm respects to the people who have risen from the chaos to build a great, rich, and noble country.

Mr. Chairman, please allow me to say a few final words to thank this lofty National People's Congress for giving me and my colleagues the great honor of inviting us to visit this lofty and progressive country, and for giving me this opportunity to speak at this congress.

In expressing my thanks, I especially want to thank the distinguished Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of this congress, because they have given us a warm welcome and cordial reception during the short but beneficial visit of the Brazilian Congressmen to China, enabling us to understand this hardworking and unremitting country, which has victoriously striven for its glorious destiny, which will surely place it among the powerful nations of the modern world.

### 促进国际谅解与友好  巴西众议院议员德毛拉先生的演说词

    促进国际谅解与友好
    巴西众议院议员德毛拉先生的演说词主席先生各位代表先生：
    我极为荣幸地能在中国全国人民代表大会上讲话，这个大会直接代表了人民，人民执行着政府的职权。
    这个大会是中国的缩影，因为它代表了组成这个伟大国家的所有各民族。
    我从来没有像现在这个时刻这样希望能够讲中国话，因为我现在代表着目前正负着促进国际谅解与友好的使命而来访问中国的巴西国会众议员们向诸位讲话。
    假如我精通了你们这种难学的、历史悠久的语言，也许我就能够更加充分地从这个庄严崇高的讲坛上表达我自己的思想。
    当我少年与青年的时候，在我脑海中所想像的中国，是一个神奇的，流传着许多龙的神话的国家，我们拉丁族富于想像力的品性，受到了你们奇异的庙堂和服饰、你们独出一格的建筑和你们美丽的、具有各式各样特色的景物所吸引，从白色的冰天雪地起，直到你们这发着光和热的太阳下的热带风光为止。
    我过去也认识你们手工艺的作品，这是世界上最名贵的，这些工艺品显示出了你们的手工艺人的灵巧，耐心与智慧是无可比拟的，他们创造出了名符其实的珍宝，无论是雕刻象牙，琢磨木料，精制瓷器，或是描绘长幅的挂画，这些挂画直到今天仍然使任何一个文明国家的最著名的绘画陈列馆为之增光。
    你们的思想家、诗人、作家、哲学家与科学家也是十分著名的，他们的作品，有很多是巴西的学生们所很熟悉的。
    我到这里来的时候，看到的中国在某些方面已经不同了。它一方面不失去自己的传统特点，尤其是在手工艺方面，同时又投身于一件更加广泛、更加深入、更有经济意义的事业上。它迅速大力进行工业化，以便摆脱半殖民地经济和原料输出国的地位，这样的原料输出国，是处在一切发展阶段中最原始的农牧业阶段。
    你们短短五、六年来在加工工业上所实现的成就，使其他一切有同样需要的民族感到惊讶、兴奋和鼓舞。
    你们不但在物质上有了进步，创造出了消费的财富。你们所做了的事比这些还多，而且多得多。你们使这个人种来源错综复杂的国家能够秩序井然、有纪律和团结一致，你们的智慧，在制定我们当代最现代化的政治宪章的时候，和谐地解决了几乎无法解决的少数民族问题，这是一件使所有人肃然敬佩的事业。
    人民的教育，尤其是儿童与青年的教育，已经在各学校、大学、文化机关和体育馆与运动场里产生出了令人钦佩的结果，改善了这一代的体质，而且也使明天一代的体质得到良好的保证。
    这就是我所看到的中国，它的大门是对一切有眼睛能看，有良知能判断的观察者开放的。
    你们革命所采取的国家形式，不是我所能加以评判的，因为这是贵国人民的自决权，这也是良好正确的国际关系的一条根本原则，但在这个革命当中，你们的确是在创造着中国名符其实的复兴。
    在一个过去只有名义上而没有事实上的主权，而且主权也不能充分行使的国家里，你们创造出了一个自由的民族，没有压迫者和占领者。你们的国旗现在在整个统一的、强大的、主权的中国的大陆领土上飘扬。
    我所代表的，是一个酷爱自由民主的国家，为了保卫自由民主，它曾经在两次战争中在本国领土之外作战，因为它酷爱其他人民的独立和幸福。
    根据这种传统，在地理上与中国距离很远但在友谊上与中国距离很近的巴西，一直很同情而且感动地注视着你们为了完全恢复自己的主权而进行过的斗争和作出的牺牲。
    这些事实构成了中国的历史，谈到这些事实的时候，我要向从混乱中挺身站起来建设一个伟大、富强与崇高的国家的人民致以我的热烈的敬意。
    主席先生，请让我最后说几句话来感谢这崇高的全国人民代表大会给了我和我的同僚们这样大的荣幸，邀请了我们访问这个崇高而进步的国家，并感谢给了我这个机会来在这个大会上讲话。
    我致谢的时候，要特别感谢这个大会杰出的委员长和副委员长，因为他们在巴西众议员们在中国作短期而有益的访问期间给了我们热烈的欢迎和殷勤的接待，使我们得以了解这个勤劳不懈的国家，它胜利地争取到了自己光荣的命运，这必将使它置身于现代世界强大的国家之列。
