Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 25th: Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi published a commentary in today's "Japan Economic News" stating: From a historical perspective, the economic relationship between Japan and mainland China must be close. In the future, Japan must continue to adopt this policy, which is unavoidable, and it is also in the interests of the Chinese people.
	Ishibashi's commentary is titled "Promoting Japan-China Trade." It also stated that most Japanese business people believe that maintaining traditional economic relations between Japan and mainland China is a matter of life and death. Of course, the Japanese government cannot adopt a policy that ignores this practical demand. However, Ishibashi also stated that Japan must still implement the "embargo restrictions" of the "Paris Coordinating Committee."
	Regarding the issue of establishing commercial representative offices in each other's countries, Ishibashi said: Before diplomatic relations between the two countries are restored, Chinese commercial representatives stationed in Japan cannot be granted diplomatic treatment, but only the necessary commercial conveniences.
	Not long ago, on June 10th, Ishibashi said that the Japanese government could not grant Chinese representatives diplomatic privileges, but the Japanese government would "take steps to treat them as diplomats in practice."

    石桥湛山认为日中贸易关系应当紧密起来
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本通商产业相石桥湛山今天在“日本经济新闻”上发表评论说：从历史上看来，日本和中国大陆的经济关系必须紧密起来，今后日本仍然要采取这种方针，这是不可避免的，同时对于中国人民也是有同样利益的。
    石桥这篇评论的题目是“促进日中贸易”。其中还说，日本多数的工商业人士都认为日本同中国大陆继续传统的经济关系是个死活问题，当然，日本政府也不能采取忽视这种切实要求的政策。但是石桥又表示日本仍然要执行“巴黎统筹委员会”的“禁运限制”。
    关于同中国互设商务代表机构的问题，石桥说：在两国邦交尚未恢复的情况下，对于中国驻日本的商务代表不能给予外交官待遇，而只能给予商务上所必需的便利。
    不久以前石桥曾在六月十日说，日本政府不能给中国代表们以外交特权，不过日本政府将“采取步骤在实际上把他们当作外交官对待”。
