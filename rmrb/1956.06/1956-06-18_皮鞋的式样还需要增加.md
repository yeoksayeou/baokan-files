Leather goods, especially leather shoes, have gone from being slow-moving to fast-selling since the second half of last year. Jilin Province originally had a large backlog of unsold stock, but after targeting rural areas and intensifying promotion in the countryside, not only did the backlog disappear, but supply could not keep up with demand. Hunan Province also put forward the slogan "Leather shoes to the countryside." Adapting to the rising living standards of the people, increasing new styles, and reducing costs are also reasons for the transformation of leather goods from slow-moving to fast-selling. Since the beginning of this year in Beijing, some shoe stores have designed stylish mid-heel leather shoes that have been extremely well-received by consumers, selling as quickly as they are made, and the number of people coming to order them has been increasing daily, quickly reaching the point where they cannot keep up. Some shoe factories in northeastern China sent technicians to Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai to learn because their styles could not meet the needs of consumers. The reason for the brisk sales of leather shoes in Chongqing is also because various factories have produced more than 300 styles of good-looking leather shoes. Hankou has also produced more than 150 new styles of leather shoes. Changsha has increased the number of leather shoe styles from the original twenty-odd to two hundred and eighty.

However, the current styles of leather shoes still cannot meet the demands of consumers. Some factories only see that they have inventory in their warehouses, without asking whether what they have are liked or disliked by consumers. A customer gave a shoe store in Chongqing the following suggestion: "Comrades, we want to wear a pair of stylish shoes, but every time we come to your store, all we see are some black high-top shoes. We hope you can produce some good-looking low-cut shoes, which is what many of our female comrades want." In the suggestion book of another store, a customer wrote: "It is summer now, but where are the sandals you make?" At a time when leather shoes are generally selling well across the country, Xi'an and Zhengzhou are still experiencing sluggish sales. The reason is that the goods in the department store windows are all old-fashioned styles.

The work of investigating and studying consumer needs is also not done well enough. The Chuandong Shoe Store in Wanxian City, Sichuan, has done special research and designed some products that are popular with consumers. The Jilin Provincial Department of Industry has also conducted investigations. However, there are still not many units that pay attention to investigation and research like this, and even fewer people like Wu Guilan, a national advanced commercial producer, who wholeheartedly devotes herself to collecting styles for improving clothing designs through diligent research. A salesperson in the leather shoe department of the Zhengzhou Department Store said it well: "There are many people who wear shoes, but there are too few people who design shoes for these people. Some rural female customers have wide and fat feet. Although the department store has large shoes, they are ugly in appearance; good-looking ones are too small to wear. They often try them on for a long time but still cannot find shoes they like." For example, some nurses request the design of a mid-heel shoe with a soft heel so that the sound of the shoes will not disturb patients when walking. If the designers all have the research spirit of Wu Guilan in improving clothing designs, these problems can be completely solved. In the past, some capitalists, in order to obtain greater profits, would walk with their heads down, looking for the styles of shoes worn by pedestrians, so as to continuously design new styles of leather shoes. This spirit of always paying attention to meeting customers' requirements for product styles is worthy of our learning and carrying forward.

### 皮鞋的式样还需要增加

    皮鞋的式样还需要增加
    卢启民
    皮革制品，特别是皮鞋，从去年下半年起开始从滞销变为畅销了。吉林省原来滞销量很大，由于面向农村，深入农村推销以后，不只不滞销，而且供不应求。湖南省也提出“皮鞋下乡”的口号。适应人民生活水平提高的情况，增加新式样和降低成本，也是皮革制品从滞销变为畅销的一个原因。北京市今年以来，部分鞋店设计的式样美观的半高跟皮鞋，受到消费者的极大欢迎，随做随销，而且登门订做者日多，以致很快发展到应酬不下。东北某些地区制鞋厂，因为式样满足不了消费者的需要，曾派技术人员到北京、天津、上海学习。重庆皮鞋所以畅销，也是由于各厂出了三百多种式样好的皮鞋。汉口也出品了新式皮鞋一百五十多种。长沙的皮鞋由原来的二十几种增加到二百八十种。
    但是，现在皮鞋式样还不能满足消费者的要求。有些工厂只看到自己库里有存货，不问存的是消费者喜欢的还是不喜欢的。有一位顾客给重庆市一家鞋店提意见说：“同志：我们想穿一双式样好的鞋子，可是几次来你们店里，看到的都是一些黑高筒的。希望你们能生产一些矮腰式样的好鞋，这是我们很多女同志的要求。”在另一家的意见簿上，顾客写道：“现在是夏季了，可是你们做的凉鞋在哪里呢？”在全国皮鞋普遍畅销的时候，西安和郑州还是滞销，原因就是百货公司橱窗里的货色，全是老式样的。
    对消费者需求的调查研究工作也还做得不够。四川万县市川东鞋店曾做过专门的研究，设计了一些受消费者欢迎的产品。吉林省工业厅也曾做过调查。但是像这样注意调查研究的单位还不多，像全国商业先进生产者吴桂兰那样，专心为改进服装搜集式样而刻苦钻研的人则更少。郑州百货公司皮鞋部一位售货员说的对：“穿鞋的人很多，但是为这些对象设计鞋子的人太少。有些农村女顾客脚面肥大，百货公司虽然有肥大的鞋子，但是样子难看；样子好的又穿不下，往往是试穿了半天还是挑不到中意的鞋子。”又如有些护士要求设计一种后跟软的半高跟鞋子，以便走起路来鞋的声音不打扰病人。要是设计人员都具有吴桂兰改进服装的研究精神，这些问题是完全可以解决的。过去，有些资本家为了取得更大利润，走路的时候也低着头，寻觅行人脚上穿的鞋样子，以便不断地设计新式样的皮鞋。这种随时注意满足顾客对产品式样的要求的精神，是值得我们学习和发扬的。
