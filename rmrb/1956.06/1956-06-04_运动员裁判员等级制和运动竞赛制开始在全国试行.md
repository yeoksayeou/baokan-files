    Athlete and Referee Ranking System and Sports Competition System Begin National Pilot Program

    A person in charge of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 3rd that the draft "Regulations on the Athlete Ranking System of the People's Republic of China," "Regulations on the Referee Ranking System," and "Provisional Regulations on Sports Competitions" have been successively published in the recent two issues of "New Sports" magazine and have begun to be implemented on a trial basis nationwide.

    The person in charge said that these three systems are important measures to rapidly improve the technical level of sports in China.

    The athlete ranking system divides athletes' rankings and titles into five levels: Master of Sports, First-Class Athlete, Second-Class Athlete, Third-Class Athlete, and Junior-Class Athlete. This is to enable athletes to systematically and further engage in regular exercise based on the "Labor and Defense System" of all-round physical development, according to certain standards and their own specialties, to ensure the continuous improvement of the technical level of individual sports.

    The referee ranking system divides referees' rankings and titles into four levels: National Referee, First-Class Referee, Second-Class Referee, and Third-Class Referee. This is to encourage existing referees to actively study and strive to improve their refereeing level; and to unite more sports activists to serve as referees, expand the ranks of referees, meet the requirements of the increasing number of competition activities, and enable athletes' skills to be fully developed.

    The sports competition system fixes the nature, methods, time, and location of competitions, so that competition activities gradually become a traditional system, and competition activities of various sports projects at all levels are held in a purposeful and planned manner. Doing so can attract the broad masses to participate in sports activities, discover and train a large number of outstanding athletes, and systematically and effectively improve their sports technical level.

    The person in charge then pointed out that the broad masses of athletes, referees, and sports activists should recognize that the ranking standards stipulated in these systems are not out of reach. In the athlete ranking system, the performance standards for first-class, second-class, and third-class athletes are formulated based on the level of the top athletes in the national, provincial, and municipal games. Although the performance standards for Masters of Sports are relatively high, China's existing top athletes can also achieve them with serious training. He said that in the recently concluded 1956 National Weightlifting Championship, four athletes—Lin Zhongying, Huang Qianghui, Zhu Hongquan, and Zhao Qingkui—had total weightlifting scores that reached or exceeded the performance standards for Masters of Sports in the flyweight, lightweight, middleweight, and light heavyweight classes, respectively.

### 运动员裁判员等级制和运动竞赛制开始在全国试行

    运动员裁判员等级制和运动竞赛制开始在全国试行
    体育运动委员会负责人三日对新华社记者说，中华人民共和国运动员等级制度条例、裁判员等级制度条例和运动竞赛暂行制度的草案，都已经在最近两期“新体育”杂志上陆续公布，并且已经开始在全国试行。
    这位负责人说，这三种制度都是迅速提高中国体育运动技术水平的重要措施。
    运动员等级制度把运动员的等级和称号分为五级：运动健将、一级运动员、二级运动员、三级运动员和少年级运动员。这是使运动员在身体全面发展的“劳卫制”的基础上，再按照一定的标准和自己的专长，系统地进一步地进行经常锻炼，保证不断地提高单项运动的技术水平。
    裁判员等级制度把裁判员的等级和称号分成四级：国家裁判、一级裁判、二级裁判和三级裁判。这是为了鼓励现有的裁判人员积极学习，努力提高裁判水平；并且团结更多的体育积极分子来担任裁判工作，扩大裁判员的队伍，满足日益增多的竞赛活动的要求，使运动员的技术得到充分的发挥。
    运动竞赛制度，是把竞赛的性质、办法、时间和地点等固定下来，使竞赛活动逐步成为传统性的制度，有目的有计划地举办各级的各种运动项目的竞赛活动。这样做，可以吸引广大群众参加体育活动，发现和锻炼大批的优秀运动员，有计划地有效地提高他们的运动技术水平。
    这位负责人接着指出，广大运动员、裁判员和体育活动积极分子，应该认识这些制度中规定的等级标准并不是高不可攀的。运动员等级制度中，一级、二级、三级运动员的成绩标准，是根据全国、省、市运动会前几名优秀运动员成绩的水平制定的。运动健将的成绩标准虽然比较高一些，但是，中国现有的最优秀的运动员，只要再经过认真的锻炼，也可以达到。他说，最近结束的1956年全国举重冠军赛中，就有四名运动员——林仲英、黄强辉、朱鸿全和赵庆奎的举重总成绩，分别达到或超过了最轻量级、轻量级、中量级和轻重量级的运动健将级的成绩标准。
