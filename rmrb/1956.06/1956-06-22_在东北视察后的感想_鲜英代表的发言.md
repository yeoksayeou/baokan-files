    I fully agree with the report made by Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian on the 1955 final accounts and the 1956 budget, the explanation made by Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan on the draft model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and the work report of the Standing Committee made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen on behalf of the Standing Committee.

    This time I went to Northeast China for inspection. The area included more than twenty factories and more than forty units in other departments in nine provinces and cities, including Shenyang, Lushun, Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, Andong, Changchun, Jilin, and Harbin. Now, I will talk about what I have seen. If there is anything inappropriate, please correct me.

    There used to be an old saying: "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how big China is; if you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how rich China is." I think we should add a sentence now: "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how amazing the achievements of New China's industrial construction are!" When I saw Anshan Steel Capital, Fushun Coal Capital, Xiaofengman Hydropower Station, and Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, I deeply felt the grandeur of our industrial construction scale. At the same time, I also saw the excellent achievements of the worker brothers who, with a spirit of selfless labor, repeatedly broke production targets on the production front. This filled me with confidence that the first five-year plan would be completed ahead of schedule, and I was excited and encouraged by the prospects of the industrialization of the motherland. For example, the Dagushan open-pit iron mine is the raw material for Anshan's iron smelting. The Dagushan open-pit iron mine was originally 270 meters high. The Japanese operated the mine for 40 years and excavated 70 meters, leaving 200 meters. Our country has only operated it for a few years since liberation and has mined 30 meters. Compared with the Japanese operation, the high production rate is self-evident, and the rest need not be detailed. This shows the superiority of socialist construction, and it is also the first education I received.

    The great achievements I mentioned above all embody the symbol of Sino-Soviet friendship. In other words, those achievements are inseparable from the fraternal and selfless assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union. In addition to seeing with my own eyes the Soviet experts in various factories and mines tirelessly helping us with various construction tasks, the most concrete and moving example is the Harbin Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory. The equipment of that factory was supplied by the Soviet Union, the machine installation was completed with the assistance of Soviet experts, and the management and operation techniques were taught by Soviet experts. Everything was done well before the experts returned. Such thorough, generous, and enthusiastic concrete assistance is truly unprecedented. This great spirit of internationalism is the second education I received.

    These facts have long been well known, but "seeing is believing." After seeing these facts with my own eyes, the profound feelings and excitement I felt are beyond words, so I especially want to say it.

    Now, I would like to talk about a few problems I found in some of the industries I have seen:

    First, there is an imbalance in the development of various industries related to industry, resulting in uncoordinated phenomena. For example, Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1 feels that the raw materials supplied by the open-pit coal mine are not enough for the needs of increased production. If the raw materials can be increased, then increasing the oil output by a certain amount is not a problem. However, the open-pit coal mine believes that the quantity supplied has already exceeded the original plan by a large amount. Another example is that the supply between the Harbin Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory and its raw material supply factory is often disconnected, and the specifications and quality of the supply are not fully in line with the requirements, so there are often problems of work stoppages waiting for materials, which affect the quality. This situation often affects each other, such as Factory A blaming Factory B, and Factory B blaming Factory C. This kind of lack of coordination between each other has a serious impact on production and should be overcome as soon as possible.

    Second, the vast majority of factories and mines have very good employee dormitories, but some have not been resolved. Because our industry has developed too fast, the number of workers has increased rapidly, and housing construction cannot keep up, so some workers have no dormitories to live in and live outside. As a result, there are difficulties in that the accommodation is too far from the workplace and it takes too much time to travel back and forth. In individual cases, the accommodation is forty or fifty miles away from the factory, so that workers have to get up and leave at four or five o'clock every morning in order not to miss work, otherwise they will be late for work, which will affect their rest. At the same time, some male and female workers cannot solve the problem of marriage because they have no dormitories. It is known that there are five or six hundred young people in one factory waiting for the dormitory to solve their marriage problems. Speaking of marriage problems, there are also eighty or ninety thousand single male workers in Anshan, which should be paid attention to and resolved.

    Third, the cost of living in the Northeast was originally higher than inside the pass, and many technicians were unwilling to go there, which has not yet been resolved. Because I saw that some employees with many children in their families felt that life was very difficult. They reflected that there is a huge disparity between light industry and heavy industry for the same work. Some people who have transferred to heavy industry departments are said to be too lucky. It is hoped that this will be taken into consideration when adjusting wages this time.

    In addition, I would like to add that some senior intellectuals have reflected that they cannot guarantee six-fifths of their working time each week. Although it is stipulated that they have six-fifths of their working time, they are often squeezed out by the problems that occur in that one-sixth of the work. Especially Party and League cadres, who must take the lead in everything, feel that there is not enough time for academic research, and they are worried that they will not be able to catch up with the international level in twelve years. Some people take the lead in various tasks while stepping up academic research, but their health is greatly affected. In May, five people from a certain department of a certain university were admitted to the hospital. They hope to be able to implement the spirit of Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals.

    在东北视察后的感想
    ——鲜英代表的发言
    我对李先念副总理兼财政部长所作的关于1955年决算和1956年预算的报告，农业部长廖鲁言所作的关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案的说明及彭真副委员长代表常务委员会所作的常务委员会的工作报告表示完全同意。
    我这次前往东北视察，地区包括沈阳、旅顺、大连、鞍山、抚顺、安东、长春、吉林、哈尔滨等九个省市的工厂二十余个及其他部门等共四十几个单位。现在，就我所见到的部分来谈一谈，是否有当，乞予指正。
    从前有句老话说：不到东北不知中国之大，不到东北不知中国之富。我想现在应该添上一句：不到东北不知新中国工业建设成就之惊人！当我看到鞍山钢都、抚顺煤都、小丰满水电站和长春第一汽车制造厂等处以后，才深深感到我们工业建设规模的宏伟。同时更见到工人弟兄以忘我劳动的精神，在生产战线上一再突破生产指标的优异成绩。从而使我对第一个五年计划提前完成充满了信心，对祖国的工业化远景为之兴奋鼓舞。举例说，大孤山露天铁矿是供鞍山炼铁的原料，大孤山露天铁矿原高270米，前日本经营该矿40年挖掘70米，还剩200米高，我国从解放起至今经营不过几年工夫就开采了30米，较之日本经营时作一对比，其生产速率之高就不言而喻了，其余不必详述。这就说明社会主义建设的优越性，也是我所受到的第一个教育。
    前面所说我所看到的那些伟大成就，处处都体现着中苏友好的标志，换句话说，那些成就是和我们伟大盟邦苏联兄弟般的无私援助分不开的。除了我亲眼见到各处厂矿里的苏联专家们不辞劳苦地在帮助我们建设种种工作之外，最具体、最动人的一个事例无过于哈尔滨的量具、刃具制造厂了。那个厂的设备是苏联供应的，机器安装是苏联专家协助完成的，管理和操作技术是苏联专家教授的。一切好了，专家们才分别回去了。像这样从头到尾、慷慨热情的具体援助，真是古今中外莫有的事。这种伟大的国际主义精神是我受到的第二个教育。
    这些事实，本来早已为众所周知的，但是“耳闻不如目见，”我在亲眼看到了这些事实之后的深刻感受和兴奋情绪，真非言语所能形容，所以我特别要把它说出来。
    现在，我想谈一谈从我看过的一些工业中所发现的几个问题：
    第一，各种工厂有关工业之间的发展，有不平衡的表现，因而有不协调现象。如抚顺石油第一厂感觉露天煤矿方面供应的原料不够增产需要，假如原料能增加若干，则增产若干油量是不成问题的。而露天煤矿方面则以为供应的数量已经超过原订计划很多了。又如哈尔滨量具刃具厂与其供给原料厂之间的供应常常脱节，供给的规格、质量亦不尽符合要求，因而常有停工待料影响质量的问题发生。这种情况常相互影响，如甲厂怪乙厂，乙厂怪丙厂。像这种彼此间不协调的缺点，对生产的影响很严重，应尽快加以克服。
    第二，绝大多数的厂矿都有很好的职工宿舍，但还有一些没有得到解决。由于我们的工业发展得太快，工人增加迅速，房屋建筑赶不上，就有一些工人无宿舍可住而住在外面。于是就发生住宿地点距离工作地点太远，往返费时的困难。个别情况有住宿与工厂相距至四、五十里之远的，以致工人为了不误上班时间，每天早晨四、五点钟便要起床动身，否则便要误工，这就会影响休息。同时还有些男女工人因为无宿舍而无法解决婚姻问题。据知有一工厂就有五、六百对青年等着宿舍解决婚姻大事。说到婚姻问题，鞍山还有单身男工八、九万人，是应当注意解决的问题。
    第三，东北的生活费用原来较关内高些，多少技术人员裹脚不前，现在仍未解决。因见到有些职工们家庭儿女多的生活很感困难。他们反映：一样的工作，轻工业与重工业之间相差悬殊。对某些转业到重工业部门的人，说他们太幸运了。这种情况，希望这次调整工资的时候予以注意。
    此外，还附带谈一下，有些高级知识分子反映不能保证每周有六分之五的工作时间的问题。他们虽则规定了有六分之五的工作时间，但常因为那六分之一的工作中所发生的问题而被挤掉了不少。尤其是党团员干部，事事要起带头作用，对学术钻研的时间特别感到不够，顾虑在十二年内赶不上国际水平，有些人一面带头干各种工作，一面又加紧学术研究，但健康受极大影响。某大学的某系在五月份就有五个人进了医院。他们希望能够贯彻周总理对知识分子问题报告的精神。
