    Lifuli Cooperative Supports Members' Individual Sideline Production
    (Our report) Since the Lifuli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengxin County, Jiangxi Province, transitioned into an advanced cooperative in January of this year, the cooperative committee has placed great importance on the issue of members operating individual sidelines and has actively provided support. A total of 250 yuan was loaned out to help members with difficulties purchase pigs. The entire cooperative, consisting of 314 households, only raised 28 sows and 219 pigs last year. Now, the number has increased to 38 sows and 550 pigs. Women also have 30% of their working hours dedicated to managing other household sideline production. For more than four months, members' daily living expenses have been covered by income from household sideline production. Since the transition to the advanced cooperative, the fifth production team, consisting of 61 households, has had 20 households sell 22 fattened pigs. Members have planted vegetables and miscellaneous grains in their respective gardens.
