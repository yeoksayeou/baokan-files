(Our dispatch from Kunming) Yunnan Province is organizing all forces to do a good job in the current flood prevention work. Since May, it has been raining continuously in various parts of Yunnan Province. According to the latest forecast from the meteorological station, Yunnan Province may still have 180 to 220 millimeters of rainfall in June, so flood prevention work is very tense. Wenshan, Zhaotong, Yuxi and other special districts have made arrangements for flood prevention work. The Qujing Special District has also established a flood prevention committee.

While preventing floods, various places have also paid attention to timely harvesting of spring crops and strengthening disaster prevention work such as drought prevention, hail prevention, and insect prevention. The Qujing Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions requiring all agricultural cooperatives to formulate two sets of production plans adapted to different weather conditions, sunny and rainy.

    云南各地进行防洪工作
    本报昆明电　云南省正在组织一切力量，做好当前的防洪工作。五月以来，云南省各地连日阴雨连绵。根据最近气象台的预告，六月份云南省还可能有一百八十到二百二十公厘的雨量，因此，防洪工作很紧张。文山、昭通、玉溪等专区对防洪工作都作了布置。曲靖专区还成立了防洪委员会。
    各地在防洪的同时，还注意了及时抢收小春作物，加强防旱、防雹、防虫等防灾工作。中共曲靖地委为此发出指示，要求各农业社要制定适应晴、雨不同天气的两套生产计划。
