Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 11th: Since the beginning of June, Jiangsu Province has experienced continuous rain. Currently, farmers throughout the province are braving the rain to urgently harvest over 30 million mu of ripened wheat. In the Huaiyin Special District, located on the southeast bank of Hongze Lake, 2 million mu of wheat have already been harvested. The Xuzhou Special District, with its relatively lower rainfall, is also working hard to harvest over 8 million mu of wheat. In the Lixiahe area, the Taihu Lake basin, and the Zhenjiang Special District, the vast number of farmers are urgently harvesting wheat.
	The wheat harvesting work in low-lying areas has received strong support from farmers in other regions. The number of farmers going to support the harvesting of 230,000 mu of wheat along the edge of Luoma Lake had increased to 15,000 by June 8th. As of the 10th, 70% of the wheat in this area had been harvested. Many agricultural cooperatives have managed to drain water, harvest, thresh, dry, and distribute simultaneously during the harvest, avoiding the loss of moldy wheat.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th: Farmers on the Huaibei Plain are rushing to harvest wheat and drain waterlogged fields day and night. As of last night, according to incomplete statistics, over 1.27 million people in the Bengbu and Fuyang Special Districts have harvested over 2 million mu of wheat. The Bengbu Special District has drained over 1.12 million mu of waterlogged land.
	The battle cry of "Harvesting one more mu is one more mu" is inspiring the organized farmers' enthusiasm for fighting the water to save grain. In many deeply flooded wheat fields, members are standing on rafts to harvest the wheat ears. Many agricultural production cooperatives have divided their manpower into three shifts for harvesting, transporting, and drying, so that harvesting, transportation, and drying are done simultaneously. The Sanba Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suxian County organized more than 2,000 members to rush to harvest, and immediately handed over the wheat to members for threshing and distribution.

People's Daily, Xi'an, 11th: Since June 6th, Shaanxi Province has experienced continuous overcast and rainy weather, which has seriously affected the smooth progress of the wheat harvest. In some areas, the wheat has begun to sprout and become moldy. In order to reduce the loss of this year's bumper wheat harvest, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee convened a telephone conference on June 10th, attended by the heads of various special districts and counties in Guanzhong, calling for the emergency mobilization of all forces to rush to harvest wheat. Currently, farmers throughout the province are braving the rain to harvest wheat day and night. Members of the 22 agricultural cooperatives in the Chengguan District of Qianxian County have proposed the slogan of harvesting an average of one shi of wheat per person. More than 100 members of the Jitai Village Agricultural Cooperative in the Yanta District of Xi'an City worked all night to transport more than 60 mu of harvested wheat back to the village. In order to prevent the transported wheat from becoming moldy, many agricultural cooperatives threshed and dried the wheat ears overnight.
	Cadres, workers, teachers, and students in the Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi areas are actively helping farmers to harvest wheat. Many leading workers from the prefectural committees, administrative offices, and counties have gone to agricultural cooperatives to lead the wheat harvest.

    江苏、安徽、陕西农民紧张抢收小麦
    本报南京11日电　六月上旬以来，江苏省连续下雨，目前全省农民正在冒雨抢收三千多万亩已成熟的小麦。位在洪泽湖东南岸的淮阴专区各县，已有二百万亩小麦抢收登场。雨量较小的徐州专区八百多万亩小麦的抢收工作也在紧张进行。里下河地区、太湖流域和镇江专区等地，广大农民都在紧张抢收小麦。
    各地低洼地区的收麦工作，得到了其它地区农民的大力支援。前往支援抢收骆马湖边二十三万亩小麦的农民，六月八日已增加到一万五千人。到十日止，这个地区70％的小麦已抢收登场。很多农业社在抢收中做到了边排水、边收、边打、边晾、边分，避免了麦子霉烂的损失。
    据新华社合肥11日电　淮北平原农民正日夜抢收小麦和突击排涝。到昨晚为止，据不完全统计，蚌埠、阜阳两专区已经有一百二十七万多人，抢收了二百多万亩小麦。蚌埠专区已排除了一百十二万多亩地里的积水。
    “多收一亩是一亩”的战斗口号，鼓舞着组织起来的农民与水争粮的战斗热情。在很多水深的麦田里社员们站在木筏上抢割麦穗。许多农业生产合作社把人力分成了抢收、运输、晾晒三班，随收随运随晾。宿县三八农业生产合作社组织了两千多个社员突击抢收，并随时把小麦交给社员脱粒、分配。
    本报西安11日电　六月六日以来，陕西省连日阴雨，严重地影响麦收的顺利进行。有些地区的小麦已开始发芽和霉烂。为了减少今年丰收小麦的损失，陕西省人民委员会在六月十日召开了各专区及关中各县市负责人参加的电话会议，号召紧急动员一切力量，突击抢收小麦。目前，全省农民都不分昼夜地冒雨抢收小麦。乾县城关区二十二个农业社的社员都提出每人平均抢收一石小麦的口号。西安市雁塔区祭台村农业社的一百多名社员，连夜把已收割的六十多亩小麦运回村里。为了防止运回的小麦霉烂，很多农业社连夜把麦穗脱粒烘干。
    关中和陕南地区的干部、工人、教员和学生们积极帮助农民抢收小麦。很多地委、专署和县的领导工作人员都到农业社领导麦收。
