Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 8th June: Starting from June 2nd, successive torrential rains have caused the water level of the Huai River mainstream to rise sharply by two meters in general, exceeding the warning level in many places.

A major flood peak in the Huai River mainstream began to appear in Xixian County, Henan Province. The water level in Xixian County reached 43.48 meters this morning, exceeding the guaranteed water level by two meters and exceeding the highest water level during the 1954 flood season by half a meter. It is expected that this flood peak will carry a flow of 9,000 cubic meters per second and hit Wangjiaba in the middle reaches within two days. This morning at 8:00 AM, the water level at Wangjiaba had already reached 28.03 meters, exceeding the warning level by two meters.

In order to urgently deal with this flood peak, some areas that should have diverted floodwaters yesterday have already opened their gates for diversion. Today, the Huai River Commission has ordered the management agencies of various flood storage projects and reservoir projects to prepare for flood diversion or storage; the unfinished culvert projects on the Huaihe North Embankment must be urgently blocked, and the unfinished dangerous sections of the embankment must be repaired and completed as soon as possible. At present, the Fuyang Special District has mobilized 50,000 laborers to the embankment for flood prevention, and a large number of flood control materials are also being rushed to the area.

According to the person in charge of the Huai River Commission's Flood Control Office: the flood season of the Huai River this year came a month earlier. It is rare in the past few decades on the Huai River to have such rapid and concentrated torrential rains when wheat is about to be harvested. Since June 2nd, the entire Huai River mainstream has been within the range of torrential rains. In the Hongru River and Ying River areas, which are the centers of the torrential rains, as well as the upper reaches of the Huai River, the rainfall has been between 200 and 250 millimeters. According to the current situation, the severity of the flood situation in the past week is no less than the situation in the first week of the 1954 flood season. At present, the sky above the Huai River basin is still covered with dark clouds, and the rain continues to fall.

    淮河流域连日暴雨干流出现洪峰
    治淮委员会下令紧急准备分洪防汛
    新华社蚌埠8日电　从六月二日开始的一场接一场的暴雨，使淮河干流水位普遍陡涨了两公尺，许多地方都超过了警戒水位。
    淮河干流的一个最大的洪峰开始出现在河南省的息县，息县的水位今天早晨达到了四十三点四八公尺，超过保证水位两公尺，比1954年汛期最高水位还高半公尺，预计这个洪峰在两天内将要挟带九千秒公方的流量袭向中游的王家坝。今天早晨八时，王家坝的水位已经达到二十八点零三公尺，超过警戒水位两公尺。
    为了紧急对付这次洪峰，昨天有一些应该分洪的地方已经启闸分洪。今天治淮委员会又下令各蓄洪工程和水库工程的管理机构准备分洪或蓄洪；淮北大堤上一些未完工的涵闸工程都要进行抢堵，未完工的堤防险段也要尽快抢修完工。目前，阜阳专区已经有五万民工上堤防汛，大批防汛器材也在赶运中。
    据治淮委员会防汛办公室负责人谈：淮河今年汛期早来了一个月。在麦子要收割的时候，出现如此急骤和集中的暴雨，这是淮河上数十年来所罕见的。从六月二日以来，整个淮河干流都处在暴雨的范围之内，作为暴雨中心的洪汝河、颖河地区以及淮河上游地区，雨量都在二百到二百五十公厘。根据目前情况看来，最近一周汛情的严重性已经不小于1954年汛期开始一周的情况。目前，淮河流域的上空依然阴云密布，雨落不停。
