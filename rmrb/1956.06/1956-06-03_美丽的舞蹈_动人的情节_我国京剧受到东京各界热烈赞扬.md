Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st: "In a word, I feel extremely happy!" This is what the famous playwright Junji Kinoshita said yesterday in the "Asahi Shimbun" when commenting on the performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe.

	He said: Every movement of the characters on stage is a beautiful dance, and this dance, combined with singing, expresses the plot profoundly, intricately, and beautifully.

	Kinoshita said that Mei Lanfang's performance of "The Drunken Concubine" clearly demonstrated the appealing charm of Peking Opera. Mei Lanfang's performance vividly expresses the subtle psychological changes of the concubine, especially the emptiness and bitterness of her life, making the audience sympathize with this unfortunate woman.

	Kinoshita also said that "The Reconciliation of General and Prime Minister" is a drama with a tight structure. A stage that was originally exaggerated and hypothetical instantly makes people feel like they have entered a real world. Only excellent actors can achieve this kind of performance.

	The president of the Toyo Music Society, Hisao Tanabe, also published his impressions in the "Asahi Shimbun," saying that Mei Lanfang's beautiful tone and skillful singing are indeed first-class in modern times. Tanabe expressed his praise for the performing skills of Yuan Shihai, the actor in "The Reconciliation of General and Prime Minister." He said that Yuan Shihai, as a Jing role (painted-face male role), has reached an extremely high level.

	Shigetoshi Kawatake, the director of the Waseda University Theatre Museum, said after watching the performance: Peking Opera has mass appeal, and has made great improvements and progress in stage decoration, performance techniques, and other aspects. Therefore, it is easier to understand than previous Peking Opera. He said that the performance of "San Cha Kou" (Crossroads Inn) is very similar to Japanese Kabuki, and also has a modern and fresh feel that Japanese Kabuki does not have. Kawatake also said that Mei Lanfang is just as young as he was thirty years ago; his voice is good and his movements are exquisite. As soon as he appears on stage, the entire stage is filled with an elegant and solemn atmosphere.

	The famous Japanese writer, Tomoyuki Murakami, said: I have seen Peking Opera several times in China in the past, and only the main actors performed well, but this time it is completely different. The main actors perform well, and the supporting actors also perform well.

	The famous Japanese drama critic, Koji Tobita, published his impressions in the "Tokyo Shimbun" yesterday, saying that the performances were all wonderful programs. These programs, which skillfully combined all the various elements of Peking Opera, have been successful.

	"Asahi Shimbun" reporter Toshio Okazaki published a feature article in the "Asahi Shimbun" yesterday. In the feature article, he wrote that even people who don't understand music or Chinese can find it very interesting. Mei Lanfang maintained a noble character throughout his performance of "The Drunken Concubine" and truly deserves to be the number one actor. Okazaki wrote that there are many other excellent actors in the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe who have come to Japan this time, and they will be able to perform exquisite skills that will captivate the Japanese people.

    美丽的舞蹈　动人的情节
    我国京剧受到东京各界热烈赞扬
    据新华社东京1日讯　“一句话，我觉得太令人高兴了！”这是著名的剧作家木下顺二昨天在“朝日新闻”上评论中国京剧团的演出时说的。
    他说：登场人物的每一个动作都是美丽的舞蹈，这种舞蹈同歌唱配合起来，把情节表现得深刻、曲折而优美。
    木下说，梅兰芳演出的“贵妃醉酒”清楚地说明了京剧有着吸引人的魅力。梅兰芳的表演，把这位贵妃的微妙心理变化，尤其是她的生活的空虚和苦闷，生动地表达出来，使观众对这位不幸的女子予以同情。
    木下还说，“将相和”是一出结构紧凑的戏剧。一座原来是夸张和假设的舞台，转眼间使人感到进入了一个真实的世界。这种表演，只有优秀演员才能做到。
    东洋音乐学会会长田边尚雄也在“朝日新闻”发表他的观感说，梅兰芳的优美的声调和巧妙的唱法，确实是现代第一流的。田边对“将相和”的演员袁世海的表演技术，表示称赞。他说，袁世海作为一个净角，已经达到极高的境界。
    早稻田大学演剧博物馆馆长河竹繁俊看过戏后说：京剧有大众性，在舞台装饰、表演技术等各方面都有了很大的改良和进步。因此，比从前的京剧容易理解。他说，“三岔口”的演出与日本的歌舞伎很相似，并且还有日本歌舞伎中没有的现代化的新鲜的感觉。河竹又说：梅兰芳与三十年前完全一样年青；声音好，动作精美。他一上场，整个舞台就弥满着高雅庄严的气氛。
    日本著名的作家村上知行说：过去在中国看过好几次京剧，都只是主角演得好，但是这一次完全不同了。主角演得好，配角演得也好。
    日本著名的戏剧评论家户板康二昨天在“东京新闻”发表观感说，这次演出的都是精采的节目。把京剧所有的各种各样的成分巧妙地配合起来的这些节目，已经获得成功了。
    “朝日新闻”记者冈崎俊夫昨天在“朝日新闻”发表了特写。他在特写中写道，即使不懂音乐又不懂中国话的人，也可以看得十分有趣。梅兰芳演出“贵妃醉酒”的时候始终保持着高尚的品格，真不愧为第一名演员。冈崎写道，这次前来日本演出的中国京剧团中，还有许多优秀的演员，他们将能够表演使日本人民心醉的精湛演技。
