French "Labor League" Basketball Team
		Competed with Shanghai Team Last Night

	Our newspaper, Shanghai, 15th dispatch: The French "Labor League" men's and women's basketball teams played two exciting friendly matches with the Shanghai men's and women's basketball teams at the Shanghai Gymnasium on the evening of the 15th.
		In the first women's team match, the Shanghai team initially adopted a fast-attack method and a half-court man-to-man defense tactic. However, because the "Labor League" team's defense was very tight and difficult to penetrate, the Shanghai team then switched to mid-range shooting to score, resulting in a victory with a score of 62 to 43.
		In the second men's team match, the French "Labor League" team mainly used its skilled screen offense and tight defense tactics. The Shanghai team initially adopted a fast break offensive method, but because it could not break through the opponent's defense line, it immediately changed its tactics, adopting mid-range shooting to lure the opponent to expand its defensive zone, and then the forwards looked for opportunities to cut into the basket to score. As a result of the match, the Shanghai team won with a score of 66 to 47.
		The French "Labor League" men's and women's basketball teams arrived in Shanghai by plane from Wuhan on the 13th.

    法国“劳联”篮球队
    昨晚同上海代表队比赛
    本报上海15日电　法国“劳联”男女篮球队，十五日晚在上海市体育馆同上海市男女篮球代表队作了两场精彩的友谊比赛。
    在第一场女子队比赛中，上海队开始采取快速进攻方法和半场人盯人的防守战术，但因“劳联”队防守非常严密，不易攻入，上海队遂即改用中距离投篮得分，结果以六十二比四十三得胜。
    在第二场男子队比赛中，法国“劳联”队仍主要采用擅长的掩护进攻和严密防守的战术。上海队最初采取快速突破的进攻方法，但因始终不能攻破对方的防线，遂即改变战术，采取中距离投篮，引诱对方扩大防御区，然后前锋寻找机会切入篮下投篮得分。比赛结果，上海队以六十六比四十七获胜。
    法国“劳联”男女篮球队是十三日由武汉坐飞机来上海的。
