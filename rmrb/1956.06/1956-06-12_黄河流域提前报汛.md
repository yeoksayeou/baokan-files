Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th. The Yellow River Basin has begun reporting the flood season ahead of schedule. On the 8th, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters had already received hydrological and meteorological reports from hydrological stations ranging from Guide in Qinghai Province to Lankao County in Henan Province. The flow rate at Shanzhou at 08:00 on the 8th was 860 cubic meters per second, and it rose slightly to 1,010 cubic meters per second at 08:00 on the 9th.

The Yellow River generally enters the flood season in July every year, and the flood reporting work also starts on July 1st. This year, because of frequent rainfall in various places, and recently more rain in many places, in order to make full preparations for flood control on the Yellow River, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters started the flood reporting work ahead of schedule based on the meteorological characteristics of this year's heavy rainfall.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th. From the 7th to the 8th, the Yellow River Flood Control Conference was held in Zhengzhou. At the meeting, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters was established and has already started working.

Nineteen people, including responsible party and government personnel from Henan and Shandong provinces, and responsible personnel from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, attended the Yellow River Flood Control Conference. The meeting focused on studying temporary measures to prevent extraordinary floods on the Yellow River before the completion of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, strengthening meteorological and flood forecasting work, and inspecting the preparatory work for flood control before the flood season; it also discussed carrying out scientific research on the evolution of the Yellow River's lower reaches and flood control projects.
