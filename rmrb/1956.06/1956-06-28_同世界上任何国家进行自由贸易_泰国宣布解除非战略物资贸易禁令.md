Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, Bangkok: The Thai government officially announced in a radio broadcast on June 21st that it has decided to lift the ban on trade in non-strategic goods, effective June 21st, and to engage in free trade with any country in the world.

Prior to this, Thailand not only imposed an embargo on China for so-called strategic materials, according to U.S. regulations, but also prohibited trade with China in rice, timber, sesame, and other similar foodstuffs.

The Thai government's statement regarding the new policy on trade with People's Democratic countries said that for the general benefit of the Thai people and to enable Thai merchants to trade directly with communist countries, the Thai authorities believe that after the Korean armistice, the ban on general non-strategic goods targeted at communist countries is no longer necessary. The statement said that henceforth, goods from any country may be imported into Thailand as long as they do not violate the law.

Nai Nan, Deputy Director-General of the Department of Foreign Trade of the Thai Ministry of Economic Affairs, told the press on the same day that in order to facilitate direct trade between Thai merchants and China, the payment issue in trade between Thailand and China could be handled by the Bank of China in Hong Kong until both sides establish banks in each other's countries.

Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram also told the press on June 20th that Thai merchants could establish trade contacts with China. He said that the State Council would soon discuss the issue of Thai merchants visiting China.

According to newspaper reports, in order to facilitate trade between Thai merchants and China, the Thai government will soon convene a meeting to discuss amending the "Anti-Communist Act."

    同世界上任何国家进行自由贸易  
    泰国宣布解除非战略物资贸易禁令
    新华社27日讯　曼谷消息：泰国政府六月二十一日在广播电台正式发布的一项声明中宣布，泰国政府决定从六月二十一日起开始解除关于非战略物资贸易的禁令，而同世界上任何国家进行自由贸易。
    在这以前，泰国不但根据美国的规定，对中国实行所谓战略物资的禁运，而且还禁止同中国进行大米、木材、芝麻和其他类似食品的贸易。
    泰国政府发布的这一项关于泰国同人民民主国家进行贸易的新政策的声明说，为了泰国人民的普遍利益，并且使泰国商人能够直接同共产党国家进行贸易，泰国当局认为，在朝鲜停战以后，针对共产党国家的一般非战略物资的禁令已经没有继续实施的必要。声明说，此后只要不违反法律的规定，任何国家的货物都可以输入泰国。
    泰国经济部对外贸易厅副厅长乃楠在同一天向报界发表谈话说，为了便利泰国商人和中国进行直接贸易，在双方还没有互设银行以前，泰国同中国在贸易上的支付问题，可以由香港的中国银行办理。
    泰国总理銮披汶在六月二十日还曾向报界发表谈话说，泰国商人可以同中国进行贸易上的联系。他表示国务会议将在最近讨论有关泰国商人到中国访问的问题。
    另据报纸报道，为了便利泰国商人同中国进行贸易，泰国政府将在最近召开会议讨论修改“反共条例”。
