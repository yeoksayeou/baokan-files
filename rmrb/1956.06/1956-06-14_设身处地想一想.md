	Think from Another's Perspective
	Kong Sang
	The North Piao Mining Bureau has failed to meet its quality targets for several years in a row. In the first quarter of this year alone, the Guanshan Mine under the bureau was fined 93,000 yuan due to poor coal quality. However, since April, the quality of coal from the North Piao Mining Bureau has greatly improved: in April, the ash content of raw coal in the entire bureau decreased by 13% compared to the first quarter, and the sulfur content decreased by 34%. The quality in May improved further compared to April. The sales of coal have since opened up. The Coal Construction Company, which was previously unwilling to distribute raw coal from the North Piao Mining Bureau, is now not only willing to distribute it, but also willing to distribute more of it.
	When summarizing its experience, the North Piao Mining Bureau said that one of the measures to improve the quality of raw coal was to conduct extensive and in-depth education on improving the quality of raw coal. On the surface, this seems like a very general experience, because who doesn't conduct ideological education among employees and cadres when implementing any policy or instruction? But when I further understood how the North Piao Mining Bureau conducted in-depth ideological education, I was attracted by some of their special educational methods. For example, in addition to calculating detailed accounts to make employees aware that poor quality raw coal caused the state a loss of more than 780,000 yuan in fines alone in 1955, they also specifically distributed the coal discarded from the Guanshan Mine to employees for their use. When family members burned the coal, they found too much gangue and cursed while burning it. Cadres and workers explained to them that the coal was produced by their own mine. They thought that their family members would forgive them after hearing the explanation, but who knew that the family members criticized them even more fiercely. Some people said: "So much money from the state is spent to produce such coal?" We wouldn't even want it if we only had to pay the transportation fee. Shouldn't the residents of Shenyang and Shanghai, who spend more than 20 yuan to buy a ton of coal, scold you even more?" Workers and cadres deeply felt from these criticisms that it was wrong to neglect quality, so they actively put forward suggestions for improving the quality of raw coal and consciously launched a production upsurge to improve the quality of raw coal.
	This is somewhat similar to the story of a Hungarian film called "The Revenge of Defective Products." I would give it a name called the "Think from Another's Perspective" education method. Nowadays, the quality of many factory products is very poor, and some of them are even very expensive. For example, the "Wuhe" brand rubber shoes published in today's newspaper are so expensive but of such low quality that even the workers in the factory themselves are unwilling to buy them. Another example is a kind of "Fragrant Flower Wine" produced in Sichuan that contains small insects. Some printing and dyeing factories cause the dyed cloth to deteriorate and become brittle due to poor raw material ratios, and it breaks with a rub of the hand. If workers, managers, engineers, technicians and their families in these factories also have the opportunity to use these products and taste the "revenge of defective products" themselves, let them hear the accusations of their relatives, and let them see the complaining eyes of their relatives, this will be a practical education for them. At that time, production workers will think from the perspective of consumers and pay attention to improving product quality; quality inspectors will also think from the perspective of consumers and strictly inspect to prevent defective products and substandard products from passing through; general managers, engineers, technicians, and leaders will also think from the perspective of consumers and prevent defective products and substandard products from being disguised as good products and leaving the factory. At that time, a production upsurge of improving product quality based on conscious action will be launched in these factories.

    设身处地想一想

    北票矿务局完不成质量计划指标，已经连续好几年了。今年第一季度，仅这个局所属的冠山矿就因煤质不好而被罚款九万三千元。可是，从四月份起，北票矿务局煤的质量大有提高：四月份全局原煤灰分比第一季度降低13％，含?率降低34％。五月份质量比四月份又有提高。煤炭销路从此打开了，过去不愿经销北票矿务局原煤的煤建公司，现在不只愿意经销，而且愿意多多经销。
    北票矿务局在总结经验的时候说，在提高原煤质量的措施中，有一条叫做广泛深入地进行提高原煤质量的教育。从表面看，这仿佛是一条很一般化的经验，因为在贯彻执行任何政策指示中，谁不向职工，向干部进行思想教育呢？但是当我进一步了解北票矿务局怎样深入进行思想教育的时候，竟被他们的一些特殊教育方法所吸引。例如他们除了通过算细账，使职工知道因原煤质量不好，仅罚款一项，1955年就给国家造成七十八万多元的损失以外，还特意把冠山矿落地煤发给职工使用。家属们烧煤的时候，发现?石太多，就一边烧，一边骂。干部和工人们对他们解释说：这些煤是自己矿生产的。他们以为自己家属听解释以后会原谅的，谁知家属们批评得更凶。有的人说：花国家那么多钱，就出这样的煤吗？咱们只花车费还不愿意要，人家沈阳、上海的居民，花二十几元买一吨煤，不该更骂你们吗？工人和干部从这些批评中深深地感到忽视质量是不对的，于是主动地提出了提高原煤质量的建议，自觉地掀起提高原煤质量的生产热潮。
    这跟匈牙利一部叫“废品的报复”的影片故事有点类似，我给它起个名字叫做“设身处地想一想”的教育方法。现在，有许多工厂的产品质量很不好，其中有些价钱还顶贵。例如今天本报发表的“价高质低的五和牌胶鞋”，连自己工厂的工人都不愿意要。又如四川出的一种“香花酒”里有小虫子。有些印染工厂因原料配得不好，使染出来的布变质发脆，用手一搓就破。如果让这些工厂的工人、管理人员、工程技术人员和他们的家属，也有机会用一用这些产品，自己尝一尝“废品报复”的滋味，让他们听一听亲人的责备声，让他们看一看亲人的埋怨的眼睛，这对他们将是一种实际的教育。那时，生产工人会替消费者设身处地想一想，而注意提高产品质量的；质量检验人员也会替消费者设身处地想一想，而严格检验，不让废品、次品过关的；一般管理人员、工程技术人员、领导人员也会替消费者设身处地想一想，而不让残品、废品冒充好品出厂的。那时候，一个建立在自觉基础上的提高产品质量的生产热潮，就会在这些工厂里掀起来。
