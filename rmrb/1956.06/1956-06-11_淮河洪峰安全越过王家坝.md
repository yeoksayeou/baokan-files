Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 10th. As of 5:00 PM today, the major flood peak of the Huai River's main stream has safely passed Wangjiaba in the middle reaches. By 7:00 PM, the water level at Wangjiaba had receded from yesterday's high of 28.98 meters to 28.86 meters. On the morning of the 9th, Wangjiaba opened its gates to release water, storing 200 million cubic meters of floodwater in the Menghe Depression, reducing the flow of the flood peak. Currently, the flood peak is heading towards Runheji. As of 5:00 PM today, the water level at Runheji reached 27.18 meters, exceeding the warning level by more than two meters.

Since noon yesterday, the heavy rain in the Huai River basin has gradually stopped. Farmers along the Huai River are seizing the opportunity to transport soil and reinforce the dikes. Currently, there are already 200,000 laborers working on the dikes. The Huai River Harnessing Committee, with Secretary-General Ma Changyan and other responsible comrades, has formed four flood control work groups that have successively arrived at important dike sections such as Fengtai, Huaiyuan, and Wuhe to inspect flood control work.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th. Relevant departments in Anhui Province are actively supporting the flood control and drainage efforts in the Huai River area.

Currently, more than 5 million jin of rice for the laborers working on the dikes has been transported from Hefei, Bengbu, and Henan Province to the northern Anhui region. The commercial departments are also shipping 530,000 tons of coal for burning to Fuyang, Mengcheng, Guoyang, and Bo County from Huainan City. 350,000 sacks and straw bags, 280 tons of lead wire, and more than 3,800 tons of kerosene and diesel oil and other flood control and drainage materials are being continuously transported from both inside and outside the province to the Huai River dikes. The Anhui Provincial Department of Transportation has also deployed 39 motorized boats and more than 13,500 wooden sailing boats in more than 20 counties and cities along the Huai River, and these boats are ready to be put into flood control efforts at any time.

    淮河洪峰安全越过王家坝
    新华社蚌埠10日电　到今日下午五时，淮河干流的大洪峰已经安全越过中游的王家坝。到下午七时，王家坝水位已从昨天最高二十八点九八公尺回落到二十八点八六公尺。九日早晨，王家坝开闸放水，在蒙河洼地拦蓄了两亿公方的洪水，减少了洪峰的流量。目前洪峰正奔向润河集。今日下午五时，润河集的水位达二十七点一八公尺，超过警戒水位两公尺多。
    从昨天中午以来，淮河流域的大雨逐渐停止。沿淮农民正抓紧时机运土培堤。目前上堤民工已经有二十万人。治淮委员会以秘书长马长炎及其他负责同志分别组成的四个防汛工作组，已经先后到达凤台、怀远、五河等重要堤段检查防汛工作。
    据新华社合肥10日电　安徽省有关部门积极支援沿淮河地区的防汛、排涝斗争。
    现在，供应上堤民工食用的五百多万斤大米，已从合肥、蚌埠及河南省运往淮北地区。商业部门供应阜阳、蒙城、涡阳、亳县等地的五十三万吨烧煤，也从淮南市启运。三十五万条麻袋草袋、二百八十吨铅丝和三千八百多吨煤油、柴油等防汛排涝器材正从省内外向淮河大堤源源调运中。安徽省交通厅并已在沿淮河的二十多个县市布置了三十九只机动轮船和一万三千五百多只木帆船，这些船只随时即可投入防汛斗争。
