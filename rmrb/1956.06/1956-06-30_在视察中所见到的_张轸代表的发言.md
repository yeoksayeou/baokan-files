What I Saw During the Inspection
—Speech by Delegate Zhang Zhen

I fully agree with the reports and explanations given by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I suggest that the congress adopt them.

This time, Delegate Zeng Zesheng and I inspected the Northwest. In addition to his speech, I will make a brief supplement. We first went to Jiuquan and inspected the Henan immigrants. We talked with several cadres and learned that they responded to the government's call and moved west with their families. Food and transportation along the way were the responsibility of the public, and the care along the way was also very thoughtful. After arriving in Jiuquan, they were warmly welcomed by the local masses. Most of the furniture and houses were borrowed from the local area, and they voluntarily joined the cooperatives. Whether they joined advanced cooperatives or primary cooperatives, each person had three to four mu of fertile land, not including the newly opened paddy fields. Each family was given a settlement allowance, and the poor were given relief funds. Looking at the fertile land in Hexi, the wheat yield per mu was over 400 jin. The Henan folks all looked smiling and unspeakably happy. Relatives and friends from their hometowns often wrote letters, wishing they could fly over.

After arriving in Xinjiang, we first went to Shihezi, 150 kilometers west of Urumqi, to inspect the military reclamation. About 4 million mu of fertile soil are distributed on both sides of the Manas River. The two military reclamation divisions have now cultivated 800,000 mu of land and are still increasing the area significantly every year. Taking the 23rd Regiment as an example, this year they cultivated 72,169 mu of wheat, cotton, and corn. Last year, the average wheat yield per mu was 318 jin, and the highest yield reached 750 jin. The average cotton yield per mu was 365 jin, and Liu Xuefo's cotton yield reached 1,349 jin per mu, which is truly a marvel of ancient and modern times. If there are no special disasters this year, the average yield will greatly exceed last year. The military reclamation comrades have turned a barren land into fertile farmland. They deeply feel that engaging in border reclamation is the most meaningful work, and they are contributing their strength with infinite confidence to increase wealth for the motherland. Now their treatment is very high, and their lives are also very comfortable. However, the most serious problem that exists is the marriage problem. Most cadres have solved it, but the military workers are mostly between 30 and 40 years old, and the proportion of female workers in the army is less than 12%, which is a big difference. If the marriage problem cannot be solved universally and timely, it will not only affect the mood for production, but also violate the reclamation policy. I hope that all parties will give strong support to solve this serious problem.

Now I will talk about the living conditions of the ethnic minorities: There are 13 ethnic groups in Xinjiang, with the Uyghur ethnic group having the largest number, followed by the Kazakh ethnic group. The total population of Xinjiang is only 4.87 million, while the area it occupies is more than 1.7 million square kilometers, accounting for more than one-sixth of the total area of the country. In the past, ethnic minorities suffered extremely painful lives due to the cruel oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. After liberation, with the help of the Party and the government, their living conditions have greatly changed. Farmers have also been allocated land, with an average of 10 to 20 mu per person, and even as much as 40 mu. I visited a production cooperative called Hongqi Production Cooperative near Yili. Each person has an average of more than 17 mu of land. Last year, the wage income of each labor force was 544 yuan. This year, due to the improvement of seeds, the use of new agricultural tools, and the improvement of work methods, production has greatly increased, so their living standards have been further improved. It is estimated that this year the average wage of each labor force may reach as much as 1,200 yuan (equivalent to 11,000 jin of wheat and 20,000 jin of corn). Even the lives of herdsmen are very different from before. This shows that the lives of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang are constantly improving and gradually improving with the development of their careers.

I also visited a production brigade (a total of 3 brigades) of a state-owned farm in Suiding. When this brigade was established in the spring of 1954, it had only 3,390 horses, cattle, and sheep. Now it has 44,169 heads, with sheep accounting for the largest majority. Xinjiang sheep, which are crossbred from Kazakh rams and Yili native sheep, have thick and soft wool that can be spun into 40-64 count yarn. The quality is even better than the world-famous Australian wool, which will greatly contribute to the future development of China's wool textile industry.

The Grape Valley in Turpan is about 10 li long. The highest yield per mu can be dried into 1,000 jin of raisins, and generally it is more than 400 jin. This year, the public purchased 1.4 million jin of raisins and 300,000 jin of fresh grapes in this township, not including the local sales, which shows that the grape production in Turpan is amazing.

Delegate Zeng Zesheng has talked a lot about the Yumen, Dushanzi, and Karamay oil mines, so I won’t talk about them here. Now I want to talk about a few impressions:

First, everyone knows that Xinjiang has a vast territory, abundant resources, and fertile land. In addition to the many rich products mentioned above, other resources such as coal, iron, copper, manganese, and various industrial and chemical raw materials are also very abundant. In order to develop the rich resources of the Northwest and accelerate socialist construction, I hope that the vast number of scientific and technical personnel and young comrades will, under the call of the Party and the government, muster up the courage and advance to our great new Northwest with full confidence.

Second, our country's ethnic policy is very successful. I visited many farmers and herdsmen's households. Every time I went to a civilian home or yurt, I was warmly welcomed and entertained. They sincerely told us in detail the comparison of their lives before and after liberation, and thanked the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in unison. A Kazakh elder over 70 years old shed tears of gratitude, and was reluctant to leave when we parted, fully expressing the brotherly friendship. Many vivid scenes also moved me to tears. Once we arrive in ethnic minority areas, we can experience that the Party and the government's ethnic policy is very correct, so we should warmly support this policy and ensure its implementation.

Third, I personally saw at the Yumen Oil Mine that when using turbine drilling to drill wells, two Soviet experts took turns on duty day and night, wearing oil-stained clothes and operating with the workers. When the No. 2 well in Karamay experienced freezing and water outflow, the situation was very serious. At that time, eight Soviet experts spent three days and three nights of hard work to save it. The cotton planted by the Shihezi military reclamation troops initially had insufficient experience and low yields. Later, with the patient guidance and concrete help of Soviet experts, the average yield reached 308 jin in 1953, and it has been continuously increasing year by year. There are many vivid examples like this, which proves that we should learn from the Soviet experts, and learn from their high degree of internationalist spirit.

Fourth, I also saw the drilling workers working hard day and night, braving the frost, snow, and wind. They often said: "As long as oil comes out, fatigue turns into joy." At the No. 32 well in Karamay, they created a new national record for drilling speed. The drilling team of the No. 29 well also showed special achievements. The hardworking spirit of the workers is worthy of introduction and praise. We believe that the people of the whole country express their infinite concern and respect for any comrades who work hard in the remote areas of the motherland, increase wealth for the motherland, and contribute to socialist construction.

### 在视察中所见到的——张轸代表的发言

    在视察中所见到的
    ——张轸代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长、彭真副委员长的报告和说明，并建议大会予以通过。
    这次我和曾泽生代表一同视察西北，在他发言以外我作个简单的补充。我们首先到酒泉，视察了河南的移民，会谈了几个干部，知道他们响应了政府的号召，全家西上，一路伙食交通都由公家负责，沿途照顾也很周到。到酒泉后，备受当地群众热烈欢迎，家具房屋多半由当地分借，并自愿入社。无论参加高级社或初级社，每人均有肥田三至四亩，新开的水田还不在内。每家都发有安家费，贫苦的并发救济金。眼看河西一片肥沃土地，每亩的小麦收成均在400斤以上。河南老乡个个都表现得笑容满面愉快难言，家乡亲友时常来信，恨不能插翅飞来。
    到新疆后，首往乌鲁木齐以西150公里的石河子视察军垦，约有400万亩膏腴土壤分布在玛纳斯河两岸，军垦两师现已耕地80万亩，每年还要大量增加。仅就二十三团来说，今年就耕种了小麦、棉花和玉米72，169亩，去年小麦平均每亩产318斤，最高产量达到750斤，棉花每亩平均365斤，最高产量刘学佛的棉花一亩达到1，349斤，真是今古奇观。今年如无特别灾害，平均产量更要大大超过去年。开垦的军工同志们把一片荒地变成肥沃的良田。他们深深感到，从事边疆屯垦是一种最有意义的工作，都抱着无限的信心贡献着自己的力量，为祖国增加财富。现在他们的待遇是很高的，生活也是很优裕的。惟存在的一个最严重问题，就是婚姻问题，一般干部多已解决，惟军工的年龄多在30——40左右，而部队女工的比例数不到12％，相差甚远。如婚姻问题不能普遍的及时的加以解决，不惟影响生产情绪，并违背屯垦政策，希望各方予以大力支持，来解决这个严重问题。
    现在我来谈谈民族的生活情况：新疆共有13个民族，以维吾尔族人数为最多，其次是哈萨克族。全疆人口只有487万，而所占的地区有170多万平方公里，约占全国领土的总面积六分之一强。过去少数民族，因受国民党反动统治的残酷压迫，生活极为痛苦。解放后，在党和政府的帮助下，他们的生活情况大大改变了。农民也都分得土地，平均每人都有10亩到20亩，甚至还有多到40亩的。我在伊犁附近参观一个名叫红旗生产合作社，每个人口平均有土地17亩多，在去年每个劳动力的工资收入是544元，今年因改良了种子，使用了一部新式农具和改进了工作方法，生产大大提高了，因此他们的生活水平又得到进一步的改善。据估计，今年平均每个劳动力的工资，可能达到1，200元之多（合小麦11，000斤，玉米20，000斤）。就是牧工的生活也与从前大不相同。这说明新疆少数民族的生活，随着事业的发展，是在不断的改进和逐步的提高。
    我还在绥定参观了国营牧场的一个生产大队（共3个大队）。这个大队在1954年春天成立时，只有马牛羊3，390头，现已有44，169头，其中以羊占最大多数。哈萨克种羊和伊犁土羊交配的新疆羊，毛厚而软，可纺40——64支细纱，质量比世界闻名的澳大利亚羊毛还好，这对我国毛纺工业发展前途，将有很大的贡献。
    吐鲁番的葡萄沟长约10里，最高产量每亩可晒葡萄干1，000斤，一般都在400斤以上。今年公家在这个乡就收购140万斤葡萄干，30万斤鲜葡萄，本地销售的还不算，这说明吐鲁番葡萄生产量是惊人的。
    至于玉门、独山子和克拉玛依油矿，曾泽生代表已讲得很多，我在这里不谈了。我现在要谈的是几点感想：
    第一，大家都知道新疆地大物博土地肥美，除上面所说的许多丰富物产以外，其他如煤铁铜锰以及各种工业和化学原料也是很丰富的。为了开发西北富源，加速社会主义建设，我希望广大的科学技术人员和青年同志们在党和政府的号召下，都鼓起勇气满怀信心地向我们伟大的新西北进军。
    第二，我们国家的民族政策是非常成功的。我访问了许多农民牧户，每到一个民家或蒙古包里，都受到热情的欢迎和招待，并且诚恳地把解放前后生活的对比，详细告诉我们，异口同声地感谢共产党和毛主席。有一哈萨克族70多岁的老人感激地流下泪来，离别时都依依不舍，充分表现了兄弟般的情谊。许多生动场面也使我感动得要流出泪来。我们一到了少数民族地区，就可以体验到党和政府的民族政策是十分正确的，因此我们应该热烈地拥护这个政策和保证其贯彻实施。
    第三，我在玉门油矿亲眼看到用涡轮钻探打井时，两个苏联专家轮流值班不分昼夜，穿上油泥衣服与工人们一起操作。在克拉玛依第二号井发生结冰出水时，形势十分严重，当时有八位苏联专家，费了三天三夜的辛苦劳动，才把它挽救过来。石河子军垦部队所种的棉花，当初经验不足，产量很低，后经苏联专家耐心指导，具体帮助，到1953年平均产量就达到308斤，而且逐年在不断地提高着。像这种生动的例子很多，这都证明了我们应该好好的向苏联专家学习，学习他们那种高度的国际主义精神。
    第四，我还看到钻井工人冒着冰霜风雪日夜不息的辛苦工作的情形。他们经常说：“只要出油，疲劳就变成愉快”。在克拉玛依32号井，他们打井速度，曾经创造过全国最高的新纪录，29号井的钻探队也表现出特别的成绩。工人同志们这样辛勤刻苦的精神，是值得介绍和表扬的。我们相信全国人民对于任何在祖国边远地方辛勤劳动，为祖国增加财富，为社会主义建设贡献力量的同志们，都表示着无限的关怀和敬意。
