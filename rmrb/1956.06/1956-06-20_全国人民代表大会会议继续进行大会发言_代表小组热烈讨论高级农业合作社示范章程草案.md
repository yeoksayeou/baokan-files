At 6:45 PM, after the last delegate finished speaking, Executive Chairman Li Jishen announced the adjournment of the meeting.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Li Jishen, Liu Bocheng, Lin Feng, Zhao Zhongyao, Deng Baoshan, Kui Bi, Luo Shifa, and Yaoxi·Zeren Zhuoma.

The meeting will continue with group discussions and plenary discussions on the 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th – Many delegates to the National People's Congress today, while discussing the "Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives" in groups, emphasized the importance of continuously increasing the income of agricultural production cooperative members.

This morning, most of the delegate groups of the Third Session of the First National People's Congress discussed the first few chapters of these regulations and the explanation made by Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture.

Many delegates from Fujian, Yunnan, Jiangsu, and other provinces expressed their support for the regulations concerning increasing the personal income of members and the correct combination of collective and individual interests. A delegate from rural Yunnan used concrete facts to illustrate the necessity of ensuring increased income for cooperative members to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives. He said that because the income of the members of his cooperative has been continuously increasing and their living standards have improved, no one has asked to withdraw from the cooperative, and their enthusiasm for production is very high.

Some delegates from Jiangxi, Liaoning, and other provinces believe that in order to ensure the continuous increase of members' income, it is also necessary to pay attention to sideline production. A delegate from the Liaoning provincial delegation said that his cooperative, due to its sole emphasis on agricultural production, had interrupted the cooperative's sideline production and placed excessive restrictions on members' household sideline occupations, resulting not only in a decrease in the income of the cooperative's members but also affecting the procurement of local specialties. Many delegates from these provinces believe that the regulations concerning the development of sideline production in the regulations are timely and correct.

In the discussions in Sichuan, Jiangsu, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities, many delegates believed that the regulations concerning the special interests of women in the regulations are extremely reasonable. Some delegates from the Sichuan provincial delegation also pointed out that the regulations concerning the special interests of women will further encourage women to participate in production. At present, some cooperatives do not pay enough attention to the special interests of women.

The discussions in the various delegate groups were very serious, and some groups even engaged in heated debates. In the chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussions, many delegates put forward opinions for modification and supplementation of some articles and words in the "Draft Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives".

As of this morning, the groups had basically concluded the discussions on the 1955 state final accounts and the 1956 state budget.

    全国人民代表大会会议继续进行大会发言
    代表小组热烈讨论高级农业合作社示范章程草案
    据新华社19日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议今天下午三时继续举行全体会议。在大会上发言的国家机关各部门负责人是：国务院副总理兼国务院第七办公室主任邓子恢、交通部长章伯钧、文化部部长沈雁冰、国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫、林业部长梁希（发言全文另发）。
    在本次人民代表大会会议开幕以前曾经分别在福建、四川、山西、山东等地视察过工作的陈绍宽、刘文辉、邓初民和钱昌照等四位代表，在今天的会议上根据他们在视察中了解到的地方工作情况，分别发表了自己的意见和对今后工作提出了建议（发言全文另发）。
    下午六时四十五分，当最后一位代表发言结束后，执行主席李济深宣布休会。
    今天会议的执行主席是：李济深、刘伯承、林枫、赵忠尧、邓宝珊、奎璧、罗世发、尧西·泽仁卓玛。
    二十日，会议将继续举行分组讨论和大会讨论。
    新华社19日讯　全国人民代表大会很多代表今天在分组讨论“高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”时，强调指出不断增加农业生产合作社社员收入的重要性。
    今天上午，第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议大部分代表小组讨论了这个章程的前几章和农业部长廖鲁言所作的说明。
    福建、云南、江苏等省的代表小组不少代表，对于章程中有关增加社员个人收入、集体利益和个人利益要正确结合等规定表示拥护。从云南省农村来的一位代表用具体事实说明保证增加社员收入，对于巩固农业生产合作社的必要性。他说，由于他所在的合作社社员收入不断增加，社员生活有了改善，没有一个人要求退社，而且生产热情很高。
    来自江西、辽宁等省的一些代表认为要保证社员收入不断增加，还必须重视副业生产。辽宁省代表小组一位代表说，他所在的合作社由于单纯强调农业生产，曾经中断了合作社的副业生产，并且给社员搞家庭副业以过多的限制，结果不但使合作社的社员的收入减少，也影响了土特产的收购工作。这些省的代表小组许多代表认为：章程中有关发展副业生产的规定，是适时的，正确的。
    四川、江苏、天津等省市的代表小组在讨论中，不少代表认为章程中有关照顾妇女特殊利益的规定极为合理。四川省代表小组有的代表还指出：章程中有关照顾妇女特殊利益的规定，将进一步鼓舞妇女参加生产的积极性。目前有些合作社对妇女的特殊利益，是照顾不够的。
    各代表小组的讨论都很认真，有的小组还热烈地展开了辩论。很多代表在逐章逐条的讨论中，对“高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”中的一些条文和字句，提出了修改和补充的意见。
    到今天上午止，各小组已经基本上结束了关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的讨论。
