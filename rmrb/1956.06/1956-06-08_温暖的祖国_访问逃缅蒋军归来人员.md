A Warm Motherland
Visiting Returnees from Chiang Kai-shek's Remnant Army in Burma
Bai Hua

Twenty-five soldiers from the Chiang Kai-shek remnant army who fled to Burma, led by squad leaders Li Zhaosheng and Li Xiaozhuang, carrying all their weapons, returned to their homeland on May 8th at 8:00 am after a thirty-three-day march. I interviewed them in a certain border area.

	In the Damp Jungles of a Foreign Land
The company to which these twenty-five men belonged had a total of thirty-two officers and soldiers and was the largest company in terms of numbers among the Chiang Kai-shek remnant army that fled to Burma. After these twenty-five men returned to the motherland, only the company commander, deputy company commander, platoon leader, special affairs officer, messenger, cook, and groom remained in the company, a total of seven people.

Li Zhaosheng and the other twenty-four men were originally young farmers from Mengdinghe Wai Township, Zhenkang County, Yunnan border region, who were abducted by the Chiang Kai-shek remnant army in 1952. For the first two years, the Chiang Kai-shek army dared not issue them guns and ammunition. If they made the slightest mistake, they were either beaten and scolded or locked in earthen caves. Soldier Li Mingde was locked in an earthen cave for several days for burning a fire on sentry duty to keep warm, and his whole body turned black. In 1953, Platoon Leader Wang Shuncai once tried to organize the soldiers to return to the motherland but was discovered, locked in an earthen cave, and disappeared. They spent their days in the mountains and forests abroad, just as they themselves said - cut off from the world. Their monthly salary could only buy three catties of rice or three packs of cigarettes. There were no vegetables to eat, and they had to find wild vegetables in the mountains themselves. They were issued only one set of blue summer uniforms each year. It was very cold in the mountains and forests. In autumn and winter, they could not leave their thatched huts. When it rained while on guard duty, their clothes got wet, and they had to take them off to dry them before putting them back on. Only four of the twenty-five men had a thin blanket. The Chiang Kai-shek remnant army had no medical personnel or medicine. They lived inhuman lives in the damp jungles of a foreign land, worrying about attacks from the Burmese army and bombings from airplanes, fearing the sticks and stones of the Burmese people, and not even daring to light bonfires... They were plagued by hunger, cold, and longing for their homes, for the motherland! Many soldiers did not believe the lies about "counterattacking the mainland," and everyone was privately thinking about the journey home.

	Our Motherland is in the North
At the end of last year, this company was pulled to a very remote place. Their officers thought that this place was far from the Chinese border, and the soldiers could not figure out the direction. The company commander often asked the soldiers: "Which direction is China in!" The soldiers replied: "We don't know." In this way, the officers felt more at ease. For his own comfort, the company commander moved the company headquarters elsewhere and sent some food to the soldiers in the mountains and forests every few days through the special affairs officer. On April 4th, soldiers Chen Yulin and Lei Qiaofa secretly talked to squad leaders Li Xiaozhuang and Li Zhaosheng and proposed, "The opportunity we have been waiting for has arrived!" When Squad Leader Li Xiaozhuang mentioned it to the soldiers, everyone said in unison: "I have had this in mind for a long time!" In this way, they began tense and short-term preparations: they themselves went to the company headquarters to collect seven days' worth of food; Li Xiaozhuang also bought a compass. They set off on April 6th. Where to go? When everyone left their hometowns, they firmly remembered that they were moving south, "Our motherland is in the north!" North - this was a direction that would not be wrong. Therefore, relying on the magnetic tip of the compass, they advanced along the Salween River! They came towards the embrace of the motherland with infinite hope! But they were also constantly worried about pursuers. The twenty-five men carried all their weapons and ammunition - one American-made .30 caliber light-heavy machine gun, twenty-two carbines and rifles, three hand grenades, and more than one thousand eight hundred rounds of various bullets. Squad Leader Li Xiaozhuang and two soldiers served as scouts. They had discussed that if the pursuers came, they would resist to the last man, because they had personally witnessed the fate of deserters who were caught and taken back - publicly executed by shooting. The twenty-five men dared not take the main roads, dared not go near the villages, and groped through the forests. In the last few days, they ran out of food, and for three days they only ate a bowl of porridge each day, and one day they only ate some wild vegetables! They endured fatigue, hunger, and illness to move forward! Because they were getting closer to the motherland every day!

	Stepped on the Soil of the Motherland
On the evening of May 7th, they arrived at a mountain outside the border of Menglian Banga in the motherland. They first inquired from the Lahu people where the People's Liberation Army was. The Lahu people replied: "We don't know!" They were all very anxious and explained to the masses that they had come to find the People's Liberation Army to hand over their guns! In this way, the Lahu people agreed to guide them across the border, but only allowed them to send two representatives without guns first. Li Xiaozhuang and Chen Yulin acted as representatives and, on the morning of May 8th, guided by the Lahu people, conveyed a message to our border troops on the border line. After our border troops talked with them, Chen Yulin went back to bring all the personnel and guns, and stepped into the warm soil of the motherland!

	The Motherland is Warm
Yes, the motherland is warm, this is the common feeling of the twenty-five men. From the first second they set foot on the soil of the motherland, they grasped countless warm hands of border guards and people of all ethnic groups! In Banga, they were warmly received by the border troops. The soldiers took out their own quilts to cover them and treated them for their illnesses (twelve of them suffered from malaria, dysentery, and colds). On the morning of May 9th, they arrived in Menglian, and the masses lined the streets to welcome them. The barber of the Menglian border troops gave them haircuts, and the health personnel treated their festering feet. On the 14th, an award ceremony was held. According to the regulations of the Ministry of National Defense, each of them received a bonus. Those who made contributions to organizing the return to the motherland were also awarded separately. On the way away from the border, the masses held welcome meetings, and they also spoke to the villagers. Li Zhaosheng said in his speech: "We came back late, we are sorry to the motherland, the people, and the People's Liberation Army!" In Menghai, the mother of Zhang Fuchang, who was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek remnant army to serve as a soldier, found them and inquired about the route back to the motherland, inquired about her son's information, and hoped that her son could also return to the motherland following their route. On the way, they visited the construction of the border region, visited the state-run Liming Farm in Mengzhe, saw tractors and new-style farm implements, and visited the middle school under construction in Lancang. They treated everything in the motherland with a very fresh and excited mood. They grabbed a handful of soil plowed loose by the tractors of the motherland, picked up a piece of brick and tile burned by the ethnic minorities themselves, stroked the sky-blue comfortable passenger car, and could not help but shed tears! They recalled their life in the damp mountain forests, "This is really something I never dreamed of!" On the evening of the 23rd, Dao Youliang, Deputy Governor of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, invited them to dinner. Deputy Governor Dao suggested to toast to celebrate their return to the embrace of the motherland! On the way, the car drivers also introduced them to the achievements of the construction of the motherland's border areas, and the elementary school students taught them to sing "The East is Red, the Sun Rises." They felt from the bottom of their hearts that the red sun of the motherland was rising! Their dark and lawless bandit life was over! From then on, they embarked on the bright and happy road.

    温暖的祖国
    访问逃缅蒋军归来人员
    白桦
    逃缅蒋军残部士兵二十五人，在班长李召生、李小壮带领下携带全部武器，经过了三十三天的行军，在五月八日上午八时踏上了家乡的土地，返回祖国。我在边境某地访问了他们。
    在阴湿的异国山林里
    这二十五人所在的连全部官兵共三十二个人，是逃缅蒋军残部人数最多的一个连。他们二十五人返回祖国后，连里只剩连长、副连长、排长、特务长、传令兵、伙夫、马夫七个人。
    李召生等二十五个人原来都是云南边境镇康县孟定河外乡的青年农民，在1952年被蒋军残部掳去。最初的两年，蒋军不敢发给他们枪枝弹药。他们稍有差错，不是被打骂，就是被关进土洞。士兵李明德由于在哨位上烧火御寒被关进土洞好几天，关得浑身发黑。1953年排长王顺才曾想组织士兵返回祖国，被发觉关进土洞后失踪。他们在境外终日躲在山林中，正像他们自己说的——隔绝人间烟火，每月薪饷只能买到三斤大米或三包纸烟。没有菜吃，要他们自己去山上找野菜。每年只发一套蓝色的单军服。山林中很冷，秋冬时候出不了茅屋，下雨站岗衣服淋湿了，只有脱下来烤干，然后再穿上。二十五人当中有一条薄毯子的只有四个人。蒋军残部没有医药人员和医药。他们就在阴湿的异国山林中过着非人的日子，耽心缅军的袭击和飞机的轰炸，害怕缅甸人民的棒子和石头，连烧篝火都不敢。……饥寒交迫，思念家乡，祖国！许多士兵都不相信“反攻大陆”的鬼话，每一个人私下里都在回顾着归途。
      我们的祖国在北方
    去年年底，这个连被拉到很远的地方，他们的军官以为这里离中国国境远了，士兵摸不清方向了，连长常常问士兵：“中国在哪个方向！”士兵回答：“不晓得。”这样，军官比较放心了。连长为了安逸，就把连部搬到别处，隔几天由特务长往山林里给士兵送些粮食。四月四日，士兵陈玉林和雷乔法找班长李小壮和李召生密谈，提出“我们时刻盼望的机会到了！”班长李小壮向士兵一提，全体不约而同地说：“我早有这个心了！”这样，他们就开始了紧张而短促的准备工作：他们自己去连部领回了七天的粮食；李小壮又买了一个指北针。四月六日出发。向哪里走呢？大家离开家乡的时候都牢牢记得，他们是在向南移动着，“我们的祖国在北方！”北方——这是个不会错的方向，于是，他们依靠着指北针的磁尖，沿着萨尔温江前进了！他们怀着无限的希望，向祖国怀抱走来了！但他们也时刻耽心着追兵，二十五个人带着全部武器和弹药——美式三○轻重两用机枪一挺，卡宾枪和步枪二十二枝、手榴弹三颗，各式子弹一千八百多发。班长李小壮和两个士兵做尖兵。他们商量过，万一追兵赶来，拼到最后一人也要反抗，因为他们以前亲眼看见过被抓回去的逃兵的命运——当众枪毙。二十五个人不敢走大路，不敢走近村寨，在森林里摸索着。最后的几天绝了粮，有三天每天只吃一碗粥，有一天只吃了一些野菜！他们忍着疲累、饥饿、疾病前进着！因为他们一天比一天更接近祖国了！
      踏上了祖国的土地
    五月七日晚上他们到了祖国孟连班戛境外的山上。他们首先向拉祜族群众打听解放军在哪里，拉祜族群众回答说：“不知道！”他们都很焦急，又向群众说明他们自己是来找解放军交枪的！这样，拉祜族群众才同意指引他们过境，但只准他们先去两个不带枪的代表。李小壮和陈玉林作代表，在五月八日早上，由拉祜族群众指引，在国境线上向我边防军传话，我边防军和他们接谈以后，陈玉林回去把全体人员和枪枝带来，走进温暖的祖国土地！
        祖国是温暖的
    是的，祖国是温暖的，这是二十五个人的共同感觉。他们从踏上祖国土地的第一秒钟起，就握到无数边防军和各族人民温暖的手！在班戛，他们受到边防部队的热情招待，战士们抽出自己的被子给他们盖，给他们治病（他们中有十二个人患疟疾、痢疾、感冒）。五月九日早晨到了孟连，群众夹道欢迎他们。驻孟连边防军的理发员给他们理了发，卫生人员给他们治了烂脚。十四日举行了授奖大会，按照国防部的规定，他们每人都得到了奖金。对组织返回祖国的有功人员又另行授了奖。在离边境途中群众都举行了欢迎会，他们也都向乡亲们讲了话。李召生在讲话中说：“我们回来的晚了，对不起祖国、人民和解放军！”在勐海的时候，被蒋军残部抓去当兵的张福昌的母亲找到他们，向他们打听返回祖国的路线，打听儿子的信息，希望儿子也能照他们的路线返回祖国。他们在途中参观了边疆的建设，参观了勐遮的国营黎明农场，看到了拖拉机和新式农具，在澜沧参观了正在修建的中学校。他们以非常新鲜和兴奋的心情对待祖国的一切，他们抓起一把祖国的被拖拉机犁松的泥土，提起一块少数民族自己烧的砖瓦，抚摸着天青色的舒适的客车，不由得两眼流着热泪！他们回忆起在阴湿的山林中的生活，“这真是做梦也想不到啊！”二十三日晚，西双版纳傣族自治州副州长刀有良请他们吃饭，刀副州长建议为祝贺他们返回祖国怀抱而干杯！在途中，汽车司机也向他们介绍祖国边疆的建设成就，小学生教他们唱“东方红，太阳升”。他们从内心里感到祖国的红太阳是升起了！他们那暗无天日的流寇生活结束了！从此走上光明幸福的大道。
