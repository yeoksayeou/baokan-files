Xinhua News Agency Report: Twenty-one chronic nephritis patients, whose treatment with Western medicine had not shown significant effects, have been cured or their conditions improved by using traditional Chinese medicine. Teachers from the Department of Internal Medicine, Peking Medical College Second Affiliated Hospital, are currently summarizing this experience.

After treatment with traditional Chinese medicine, these cases showed a very obvious diuretic and anti-swelling effect. In some cases, protein in the urine was reduced or even disappeared. Three patients were completely cured, and kidney function and blood chemistry changes also returned to normal in some patients. Two very weak patients, after taking traditional Chinese medicine, not only saw improvement in their condition but also significant improvements in their health. Thirty to forty outpatient cases have had the same effect. Western doctors observed the methods of treatment and the medicines prescribed by the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Professor Wang Shuxian, director of the Department of Internal Medicine, said: "The significant diuretic effect of traditional Chinese medicine, and the comprehensive treatment methods of using diuretics to treat diseases combined with tonifying the patient, are a contribution to medicine."

Currently, teachers from the Department of Internal Medicine are further studying the efficacy of various traditional Chinese medicines and learning methods of using Chinese medicine to treat diseases.

More than thirty topics related to traditional Chinese medicine are being studied in various departments and research offices of Peking Medical College.

    西医研究中医治疗慢性肾脏炎的经验
    新华社讯　经西医观察治疗效果不明显的二十一个慢性肾脏炎患者，都用中药治愈或病情好转了。北京医学院第二附属医院系统内科教研组的教师正在总结这项经验。
    这些病例经过中医治疗，就产生十分明显的利尿和消肿作用，部分病例尿中蛋白减少甚至消失，有三个病人完全治愈，某些病人肾功能和血液化学变化也恢复正常。有两个身体十分瘦弱的病人，经服中药后，不但病情好转，健康状况也有显著增进。门诊的三、四十个病例也有同样的效果。西医观察了中医的治疗方法和下药的情况。系统内科教研组主任王叔咸教授说：中药显著的利尿作用，和中医用利尿治病，同用滋补病人的综合治疗方法，在医学上是有贡献的。
    现在系统内科教研组的教师正在进一步研究各种中药的疗效，学习中医用药治病的方法。
    北京医学院各科、各教研室正在研究有关中医中药的题目共有三十多项。
