The recent visit of Yugoslav President Tito to the Soviet Union, lasting three weeks, was met with a warm, fraternal welcome from the Soviet government and people. The renewed meeting between the leaders of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments and parties has opened up broad avenues for the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. The sincere and frank talks between the two sides on the development of bilateral and inter-party relations, as well as the development of the current international situation, have yielded significant results. The Joint Statement of the Governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the Declaration on the Relations Between the Soviet and Yugoslav Parties have been published. These two documents of great historical significance fully embody the common desire for mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and between the two parties, and reflect the deep concern of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments and peoples for promoting international peace and cooperation and further easing international tensions.

The Joint Statement of the Governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia marks a new stage in the friendly cooperation between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples. The Belgrade Declaration, signed last June, laid the foundation for the restoration and development of the traditional friendship between the two countries. In the past year, thanks to the joint efforts of the two countries, great achievements have been made in developing friendly cooperation and strengthening relations in the economic, cultural, scientific, technological, and other fields. All the provisions of the Belgrade Declaration relating to Soviet-Yugoslav relations have been implemented. The further development of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is the result of the vigorous promotion of normalization and friendly cooperation by the peoples of the two countries.

On the basis of the complete normalization of Soviet-Yugoslav relations, the two countries are actively engaged in comprehensive cooperation. During the talks, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia reached an agreement on further expanding economic ties and believed that concluding long-term economic agreements would be beneficial to both sides. The two countries agreed to formulate a plan of work for cultural cooperation based on the cultural agreement already signed; and agreed to continue promoting contacts between political, social, and trade union organizations of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia for the exchange of socialist experiences and views. Cooperation in all these areas is in the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and in the interests of peace and socialism.

The publication of the Joint Statement of the Governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is a major event in current international relations. The Joint Statement fully demonstrates the consistency of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in handling international affairs, and the common desire of the two governments to consolidate peace and develop cooperation among countries. Both governments have put forward positive proposals for resolving major international issues. They welcome the expansion of international contacts, the trend toward resolving international issues through negotiations, and the strengthening of the role of the United Nations. They believe that efforts must be made to reach agreement on issues that can now be resolved, such as disarmament and collective security, the peaceful use of atomic energy and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of negative factors hindering cooperation among the peoples of Europe. On the German question, they advocate that German unification should be achieved through direct negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and the efforts of the great powers. They expressed their intention to work through the United Nations and their direct relations with various countries to promote the elimination of the dangers of local conflicts and frictions between countries; and believe that maximum efforts must be made to strengthen economic and cultural ties between countries and to assist underdeveloped countries without military or political conditions attached. The governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia also reaffirmed the policy of peaceful coexistence based on the principles of sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs. Undoubtedly, the proposals and efforts of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in resolving major international issues will contribute to understanding, cooperation among countries, and further easing of international tensions, and will help promote peace and security in Europe and the world.

The development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia over the past year has created favorable conditions for cooperation between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In order to strengthen cooperation between the two socialist countries of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in the international workers' movement, and also to develop peaceful coexistence and cooperation between countries, for the sake of peace and the freedom and independence of all peoples, the Soviet and Yugoslav parties believe that developing cooperation between them is entirely necessary and beneficial. There is a consistent foundation between the Soviet and Yugoslav parties: they are both guided by the theory of Marxism-Leninism; they are both ruling parties at present, and they are both leading the people of their own countries to build socialist and communist societies, and to promote human progress and world peace. It has been determined in the Declaration on the Relations Between the Soviet and Yugoslav Parties that cooperation between the two parties will be conducted through various specific forms on the basis of complete voluntariness, equality, friendly criticism, and comradely exchange of views. The cooperation between the Soviet and Yugoslav parties will not only help the development of Soviet-Yugoslav relations and the friendship between the two peoples, but will also be an important contribution to the international workers' movement and all progressive movements, as well as the cause of world peace.

The Joint Statement of the Governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia once again emphasized that the People's Republic of China should obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations, and that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China over Taiwan should be resolved. The Chinese people welcome this just support. We believe that the efforts of the Chinese people to safeguard their sovereignty over Taiwan will receive increasing sympathy and support. The propositions of the Joint Statement of the Governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are precisely a reflection of this reality.

The further development of Soviet-Yugoslav relations not only makes a significant contribution to world peace, but will also further strengthen the unity of the international workers' movement. The Chinese people, as well as all peace-loving people and those who care about the international workers' movement, will feel excited and encouraged after reading these two documents. However, there are also some people who feel uneasy and worried about this, and even express irrepressible anger and hatred. American Senators like Knowland and McCarthy have long been clamoring for a "reassessment" of "aid" to Yugoslavia. However, those who are slightly more clear-headed will see that Knowland and McCarthy should first "reassess" what use their clamor and intimidation can have. They will never understand that the friendship between the fraternal Soviet and Yugoslav peoples, like the friendship between the peoples of all socialist countries, is eternal and unbreakable, and that any force is futile to destroy it.

    苏南会谈的巨大成果
    南斯拉夫总统铁托最近在苏联进行了为期三周的访问，受到苏联政府和人民的热烈的兄弟般的欢迎。苏南两国政府和党的领导人的再度会见，为进一步发展两国的友好和合作关系开辟了广阔的道路。双方就两国关系和两党关系的发展，以及目前国际局势的发展所进行的真诚坦率的会谈，已经获得了重大的成果。苏南两国政府联合声明和苏南两党关系宣言发表了。这两个具有重大历史意义的文件，充分体现了苏南两国之间和两党之间互相谅解和友好合作的共同愿望，体现了苏南两国政府和人民对促进国际和平合作和进一步缓和国际紧张局势的深切关怀。
    苏南两国政府联合声明标志着苏南两国人民友好合作的新阶段。去年六月签订的贝尔格莱德宣言，为恢复和发展苏南两国的传统友谊奠定了基础。在过去一年中，由于两国的共同努力，在发展两国友好合作，在加强两国经济、文化、科学、技术以及其他方面的关系上，已经取得了巨大的成就。贝尔格莱德宣言中所有同苏南两国关系有关的条款都实现了。苏南两国关系的进一步发展，是苏南两国人民大力促进两国关系正常化和友好合作的结果。
    在苏南两国关系完全正常化的基础上，两国积极地进行着全面的合作。在这次会谈中，苏南两国已就进一步扩大经济联系达成了协议，并且认为缔结长期的经济协定对双方都是有利的。两国同意在已经签订的文化协定的基础上拟订文化合作工作计划；并且同意继续促进苏南两国政治、社会和工会组织为了交换社会主义经验和交换意见而进行的接触。所有这些方面的合作，都是符合于苏南两国人民的利益，符合和平和社会主义的利益的。
    苏南两国政府联合声明的发表是目前国际关系中的重大事件。联合声明充分显示了苏南两国在处理国际事务原则方面的一致性，显示了两国政府为巩固和平和发展各国合作的共同愿望。两国政府对于解决各项重大的国际问题都提出了积极的主张。它们欢迎国际接触的扩大，通过谈判解决国际问题趋向的发展和联合国作用的加强。它们认为：必须尽力使现在可以解决的问题达成协议，例如裁军和集体安全问题、和平利用原子能和禁止原子武器问题，以及消除阻碍欧洲各国人民合作的否定因素等问题。在德国问题上，它们主张应当通过德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的直接谈判和大国的努力来达到德国的统一。它们表示将努力通过联合国和它们同各国的直接关系来促进国家间地方性冲突和摩擦的危险的消除；认为必须尽最大努力来加强各国间的经济和文化联系，在不附带军事和政治的条件下援助不发达国家。苏南两国政府并且重申了以自主、独立、领土完整、互不侵犯、平等、互相尊重和互不干涉内政的原则为基础的和平共处的政策。无疑的，苏南两国在解决目前重大国际问题上的主张和努力，有助于各国之间的谅解、合作和国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，有助于促进欧洲和全世界的和平和安全。
    一年来苏南两国友好关系的发展，为苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的合作创造了有利的条件。为了加强苏联和南斯拉夫两个社会主义国家的合作，为了加强两国在国际工人运动中的合作，同时也为了发展各国之间的和平共处和合作，为了和平和各国人民的自由独立，苏南两党认为发展它们之间的合作是完全必要和有益的。苏南两党之间有着一致的基础：它们都是以马克思列宁主义学说为指导思想的；目前它们都是执政党，它们都正在领导自己国家的人民为建成社会主义和共产主义社会，为促进人类进步和世界和平而努力。在苏南两党关系宣言中已经确定：在完全自愿、平等、友好的批评和同志般的交换意见的基础上，苏南两党之间将通过各种具体形式进行合作。苏南两党的合作不仅有助于苏南两国关系和人民友谊的发展，而且是对国际工人运动和一切进步运动以及世界和平事业的重要的贡献。
    苏南两国政府联合声明中再一次强调指出：中华人民共和国应取得在联合国中的合法地位，中华人民共和国对台湾的合法权利应该得到解决。中国人民欢迎这一正义的支持。我们相信，中国人民维护自己领土台湾主权的努力，将受到越来越多的同情和支持。苏南两国政府联合声明的主张，正是这一现实的反映。
    苏南关系的进一步发展不仅对世界和平有重大的贡献，而且将进一步加强国际工人运动的团结。中国人民以及所有爱好和平和关心国际工人运动的人们，读了这两个文件都会感到兴奋和鼓舞。然而，也有一些人对此感到不安和忧虑，甚至表示不可遏制的愤怒和仇恨。美国参议员诺兰和麦卡锡之流早已忍不住地叫嚣要“重新估计”对南斯拉夫的“援助”。然而，头脑稍微清醒一点的人都会看出，诺兰和麦卡锡之流首先应该“重新估计”一下他们的叫嚣和恐吓能有什么用处。他们永远不会懂得，兄弟般的苏联和南斯拉夫人民之间的友谊，同所有社会主义国家人民之间的友谊一样，是永恒的，牢不可破的，任何力量要破坏它都是徒然的。
