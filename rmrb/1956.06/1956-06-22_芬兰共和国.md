    The Republic of Finland

    The Republic of Finland is located in Northern Europe. It is bordered by Norway to the north, Sweden to the northwest, and the Soviet Union to the east and southeast. It faces the sea to the south and southwest. The country has a population of 4,215,000, of which 91% are Finns and 9% are Swedes. It covers an area of 300,596 square kilometers. A quarter of Finland's territory is within the Arctic Circle. The climate is particularly cold, with only the southwest coast affected by the North Sea warm current, resulting in a milder climate. In the Arctic Circle region, the sun does not appear throughout the winter. In summer, the days are very long, and at certain times, the sun can even be seen at midnight.

    The capital of Finland is Helsinki, located on the Gulf of Finland in the south. It is a beautiful city surrounded by the sea on three sides, only about 280 kilometers from Leningrad in the Soviet Union, with railway connections. The 1952 Olympic Games were held here.

    Historically, Finland suffered under Swedish rule for a long period, totaling more than 500 years. After the Russo-Swedish War in 1809, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, and it became the Grand Duchy of Imperial Russia. Finland became an independent republic after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia in 1917.

    The Republic of Finland adopts a presidential system. According to the constitution, the president is the head of state, with a term of six years. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and possesses broad powers in foreign affairs and other areas. On February 15th of this year, a presidential election was held, and the leader of the Agrarian League, former Prime Minister Urho Kekkonen, was elected.

    The Finnish Parliament is unicameral, with 200 members, elected by proportional representation through universal suffrage. Members serve a term of three years. Parliament has legislative power and the power to oversee the government. The government is usually formed by the leader of the majority party in parliament, appointed by the president. After Kekkonen was elected president, a four-party coalition government was formed by the Social Democratic Party, the Agrarian League, the Swedish People's Party, and the Finnish People's Party. The current Prime Minister is Fagerholm of the Social Democratic Party.

    Finland has a relatively developed capitalist economy. Industry and transportation account for 54.2% of the national economy, agriculture accounts for 15.2%, and other sectors such as fishing and hunting account for the rest. The industry is mainly based on paper and wood processing, accounting for 35% of the national industrial output value. There are also some metal processing industries. Due to the abundance of lakes, it is known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes." Inland water transport is developed, and it possesses abundant hydropower resources, with an annual hydropower generation of 2.5 billion kilowatt-hours. Finland has vast forest areas, with forests covering more than 70% of the land. However, industrial raw materials such as steel, coal, oil, and grain are scarce and rely heavily on foreign supply. Finnish industry also relies on exports, with timber, wood products, and paper exports accounting for 80% of foreign trade.

    Finland's main foreign trade partners are Western countries. However, in recent years, trade relations between Finland and the Soviet Union have greatly developed. In 1950, a five-year trade agreement was signed between Finland and the Soviet Union. In 1954, a new five-year trade agreement was signed, greatly increasing the trade volume between the two countries. At the same time, in the past two years, the Soviet Union has twice provided Finland with preferential loans of 80 million rubles to help Finland develop its own economy. In addition, Finland's trade relations with the People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries have also increased.

    The Finnish government pursues a policy of peaceful neutrality in foreign affairs, which has led to the increasing expansion of its foreign relations and the growing improvement of its international status.

    Since Finland and our country officially established diplomatic relations in 1950, friendly relations between China and Finland have also greatly developed. In September 1954, China and Finland agreed to upgrade their legations and exchange ambassadors.

    With the active support of the Soviet Union and other countries, Finland officially joined the United Nations in 1955.

    芬兰共和国
    芬兰共和国在欧洲的北部。它的北面是挪威，西北是瑞典，东面、东南面都与苏联接壤，南面西南靠海。全国人口有四百二十一万五千人，其中芬兰族占91％，瑞典族占9％。面积共三十万零五千三百九十六平方公里。芬兰有四分之一的领土是在北极圈内，气候特别寒冷，只有西南岸受到北海暖流影响，气候较温和。在北极圈里的地区，整个冬季不见太阳。到夏季白天很长，在某一时期，甚至半夜也能见到太阳。
    芬兰的首都是位于南面芬兰湾上的赫尔辛基。这是一个三面临海的美丽城市，距苏联的列宁格勒仅约二百八十公里，有铁路相通。1952年世界奥林匹克运动会曾在这里举行。
    芬兰在历史上曾长期遭受瑞典的统治，前后共达五百多年。1809年俄瑞战争后，瑞典把芬兰割让给俄国，成为帝俄的大公国。1917年俄国十月社会主义革命胜利以后，芬兰才成为一个独立的共和国。
    芬兰共和国采取总统制。根据宪法，总统为国家元首，任期六年。总统兼军队统帅，并拥有对外交和其他方面的广泛权力。今年二月十五日，举行总统选举，农民联盟领袖、前总理吉科宁当选。
    芬兰议会是一院制，有二百名议员，按比例代表制普选产生，议员任期三年。议会有立法权和监督政府之权。政府通常是由总统任命国会多数党领袖组成。吉科宁当选总统后，由社会民主党、农民联盟、瑞典人民党和芬兰人民党组成四党联合政府。现任总理是社会民主党的法格霍姆。
    芬兰资本主义经济相当发展，工业运输业占国民经济54.2％，农业占15.2％，其他为渔业和打猎等。工业以造纸和木材加工工业为主，占全国工业产值35％；还有一些加工性质的金属工业。由于湖泊很多，有“千湖之国”的称号，内陆水运发达，并拥有丰富的水力资源，水力发电的年产量为25亿瓩时。芬兰的森林面积很广，70％以上的土地是大森林地带。但工业原料钢铁、煤、石油和粮食等，都很缺乏，需要仰赖国外供给。芬兰工业也要依靠出口，木材、木制品和纸的出口占对外贸易的80％。
    芬兰对外贸易的主要对象是西方国家。但近年来芬兰和苏联的贸易关系有很大的发展。1950年签订了芬苏五年贸易协定，1954年又签订了新的五年贸易协定，大大增加了两国之间的贸易额。同时，在过去两年，苏联曾经两度以优惠条件贷给芬兰八千万卢布，来帮助芬兰发展本国的经济。此外，芬兰同中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的贸易关系也有了增长。
    芬兰政府实行和平中立的外交政策，使它的对外关系日益扩展，国际地位日益提高。
    1950年芬兰和我国正式建立外交关系以后，中芬两国友好关系，也有了很大的发展。1954年9月我国和芬兰双方同意把公使馆升格，互派大使。
    在苏联和其他国家的积极支持下，芬兰在1955年正式参加了联合国。
