Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 5th. Fishermen in Beihai City have caught two rare great sharks. One of these great sharks weighs 4,000 jin, and the other weighs 6,500 jin. Their heads are approximately flat and round, their teeth are small, and they have a gentle nature, preferring to eat plankton. This is different from the characteristics of general sharks, which have pointed and round heads, sharp teeth, are carnivorous, and have fierce natures.

Staff from the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Department believe that these two great sharks are of significant research value. The two great sharks are now being transported from Beihai to Guangzhou to be made into specimens for research by the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Experimental Institute.
