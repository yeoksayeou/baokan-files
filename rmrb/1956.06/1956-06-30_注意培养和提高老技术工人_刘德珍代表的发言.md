Pay Attention to Cultivating and Improving Veteran Technical Workers
——Speech by Representative Liu Dezhen

My speech represents the common opinions of comrades Liu Yingyuan, Liu Shimei, and myself. We fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, Minister Liao Luyan's explanation on the draft model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Now, we would like to raise a few issues encountered in our work and inspections for the conference's reference:

First, regarding the cultivation, improvement, and utilization of veteran technical workers.

Some veteran technical workers who should have been promoted have not been. Some veteran technical workers have more than ten years of seniority and practical operational skills. According to their skills, they should be promoted, but they haven't been promoted since 1951. For example, Li Lingdi, a veteran technical worker at Qinghe Woolen Mill, has more than ten years of seniority and was rated as a fifth-grade worker in 1952. His skills are very good, and he has trained a group of young technical workers, some of whom are now fourth-grade workers, but Li Lingdi has not been promoted. He has opinions about this, and some cadres say he is making trouble for wage reasons, is pursuing personal interests, and is ideologically backward, so he cannot be promoted. Another example is Dou Yu, a welder at Shijingshan Power Plant. His skills are very good. When power plants in Tianjin, Tangshan, Datong, and other places encounter technical problems in welding that cannot be solved, they ask him for help. Some of the apprentices he has trained are already sixth- or seventh-grade workers, but he has been a seventh-grade worker since 1951. Dou Yu has opinions about promotion, and some people criticize him for being selfish and pursuing personal issues, so they don't promote him. Why haven't some veteran technical workers who should have been promoted been promoted? The reason is that some cadres assess wages based on impressions rather than technical standards; some cadres only compare people with each other, abandoning standards; and some cadres don't consider the actual problems of veteran workers' families (they generally have large families and heavier burdens), nor do they consider whether their opinions are reasonable, and they label them as pursuing personal interests and being ideologically backward, so they don't promote them. Secondly, some technical standards in the past were not in line with the actual situation. Assessments only focused on book knowledge and not on the actual operational abilities of workers. For example, Wu Demao, a veteran worker at Shijingshan Power Plant, was rated as a seventh-grade worker in 1951. He can solve problems with generators and motors and could have been an eighth-grade worker, but the technical standards stipulated that eighth-grade workers must know the basic principles of power generation, transmission, and distribution, and understand the performance and structural principles of AC motors, etc. Thus, those with low cultural levels cannot be promoted. Although veteran technical workers can solve practical problems, they generally have a lower level of education, cannot write, and cannot explain things systematically, often rambling and not being clear; while young workers have a certain level of education and can answer questions logically; thus, some veteran masters often fail the tests (of course, young workers who meet the technical standards should be promoted). Some veteran workers feel that they are not as promising as their apprentices, and whenever it is time for grading, they say, "Go, grade them," and they themselves are not included. We hope that the issue of veteran technical workers will be addressed in this wage assessment.

There are also problems with the utilization of veteran workers in some factories. Of course, veteran workers have shortcomings. They have a low level of education, and with some experience, they tend to be more subjective and verbose. However, some cadres not only lack patience in cultivating and improving veteran workers, but also have an attitude of dislike towards them. Of course, it is necessary to transfer veteran workers for work needs, but this is not always the case. It seems as if veteran workers are obstacles, and they are transferred arbitrarily. Veteran workers have worked in the factory for more than ten or even twenty or thirty years, and they feel very uncomfortable leaving the factory. The state has implemented a labor insurance system, stipulating retirement methods for elderly workers, so that workers receive material assistance when they lose their ability to work, which has played a very good role in encouraging the enthusiasm of workers and staff. However, some factories and mines mobilize veteran workers who still have the ability to work to retire, and even mobilize party member veteran workers to take the lead in retiring. Veteran workers laugh and talk at the farewell party in the factory, but cry when they get home. The Harbin Power Plant let veteran workers Jiang Lianfeng and Feng Yi retire, but they were still able to work and did not want to retire. Feng Yi said, "I can work, why don't they let me work? Retirement still gets 70% of the salary, not retiring and still being able to work is always better than a new apprentice." After Jiang Lianfeng retired, the factory still asked him for help in solving technical problems. Because there are the above problems with the utilization and cultivation of veteran workers, some veteran workers are pessimistic and disappointed, feeling that they are old and useless. We believe that veteran workers have skills and experience, are familiar with production, and are an important force in industrial construction. Therefore, while cultivating and improving young workers, the leadership should also pay attention to cultivating and improving veteran workers, improving their cultural level, and enabling them to further learn a professional skill, which is urgently needed for national construction. Attention should also be paid to the rational use of veteran workers, so that they can play the role of "old hens." Veteran workers should be given active encouragement and help; for veteran technical workers who have the ability to work, it is not necessary to mobilize them to retire, and they can be assigned appropriate work, which is beneficial to production.

Second, regarding the cultivation of model workers. Model workers have many meetings and heavy burdens, cannot participate in production regularly, technical skills stagnate, and cultural learning progresses slowly. For example, Representative Liu Shimei has been studying junior high school for several years and still hasn't graduated. The model workers themselves also feel a heavy ideological burden. We ask the leadership to pay attention to reducing the burden on model workers, reducing meetings, and enabling them to concentrate on production. At the same time, we feel that leaders rarely offer straightforward criticism to model workers. Even when there are problems, they often talk around them or don't talk about them at all; some leaders treat model workers as a different kind of person, which is not true care for model workers. If model workers have shortcomings or mistakes, and if the leaders do not criticize them and the masses do not speak up, the shortcomings or mistakes of the model workers cannot be corrected, which is not good for the work. We hope that neither the leaders nor the workers will treat model workers as a different kind of person, but will conduct regular education and assistance to model workers in a realistic manner, and not let them become detached from the masses.

Third, regarding the factory security personnel. Factory security personnel are mostly selected from among the activists among the workers, but their treatment is very low, and some have been at 170 points since 1951, so it is inevitable that they will have emotions. Security personnel are excellent young people. If they were transferred out to work as workers, they could generally be third- to fifth-grade workers by now. We believe that in addition to appropriately solving the treatment problems of factory security personnel, we should also pay attention to solving the source of security personnel.

Fourth, regarding the retail prices of commodities. We have found that some stores in Beijing raise the prices of goods at will. For example, Representative Huang Runping saw a pair of swimming trunks in the Dong'an Market but did not buy them that day. When he went to buy them the next day, the price had increased by eight cents. Such arbitrary price increases are not in line with the state's price policy, and similar situations can be encountered when buying things. We believe that the relevant departments should thoroughly check and correct this phenomenon. Commercial departments should set standard prices for various daily necessities and announce them to the public in an appropriate manner. The supervisory departments should strengthen the supervision of the implementation of price policies to continue to maintain price stability.

### 注意培养和提高老技术工人——刘德珍代表的发言

专栏：

    注意培养和提高老技术工人
    ——刘德珍代表的发言
    我的发言是刘英源、刘世梅同志和我的共同意见。我们完全同意李先念副总理关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，廖鲁言部长关于高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）的说明，和彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。
    现在我们就工作中和视察中接触到的几个问题提出来供大会参考：
    第一、关于对老技术工人的培养、提高和使用问题。
    有些老技术工人应升级的没有升级。有些老技术工人的工龄在十几年以上，有实际操作技术，按照技术应该升级，但从1951年以来没有升级。如清河制呢厂老技术工人李玲弟，有十几年工龄，1952年评为五级工。他的技术很好，培养了一部分青年技术工人，有的现在已经是四级工了，而李玲弟仍旧没有升级。他对这点有意见，有的干部就说他为工资闹情绪，是闹个人利益，是思想落后，不能升级。又如石景山发电厂电焊工窦玉技术很好，天津、唐山、大同等处发电厂遇到解决不了的电焊上的技术问题，就找他帮忙解决。他培养的学徒有些已经是六、七级的工人了，而他从1951年起到现在还是七级工。窦玉对升级问题有意见，就有人批评他自私自利，闹个人问题，不给他升级。为什么有些老技术工人应该升级却没有升级呢？这原因首先是有些干部在评定工资时有的是按印象评，而不按技术标准评；有些干部只拿人与人比，而放弃了标准；还有的干部不看老工人的家庭实际问题（他们一般家口多，负担较重），也不看他们的意见是否合理，就加上个人利益、思想落后的帽子，不给升级。其次是过去有的技术标准规定得不合实际情况，评定时只注重书本知识，不注重工人实际操作能力。如石景山发电厂老工人吴德茂1951年评为七级工，发电机、马达出了毛病他都能解决，本来是可以作八级工的，但是技术标准规定八级工要知道发电、送电、配电的基本原理，了解交流电机的性能、构造原理等等，这样文化水平不高就不能升级。老技术工人虽然能解决实际问题，但他们一般文化水平较低，不会写，不会有系统地说，常常囉囉嗦嗦说不清楚；而青年工人有一定文化水平，能够一问一答，有条有理；这样考起工来有些老师傅常常考不上（当然，达到技术标准的青年工人是应该提拔的）。有些老工人觉得自己不如徒弟有出息，每逢评级时就说：“走，给人家评级去”，他们自己则没有份。我们希望在这次评定工资中注意解决老技术工人的问题。
    有些工厂在对老工人的使用上也存在着问题。当然，老工人是有缺点的，他们文化低，有了些经验，这样就容易主观性大些，絮絮叨叨。而有些干部对老工人不但缺乏耐心的培养与提高，反而存在着讨厌情绪。当然为了工作上需要调动老工人是应该的，但是有的情况却不是这样，好像老工人是障碍，随便调动。老工人在本厂工作了十几年甚至二、三十年，离开工厂心里非常难受。国家实行了劳动保险制度，规定年老工人退休办法，使工人在丧失劳动力时获得物质帮助，这对鼓舞职工的积极性上起了很好的作用。但是有些厂矿却动员仍有劳动能力的老工人退休，还动员党员老工人带头退休。老工人在厂子里欢送时还说说笑笑，到家里就哭起来了。哈尔滨发电厂让老工人姜连风、冯义退休，他们仍能劳动不愿退休。冯义说：“我能干活为什么不叫我干？退休也要拿70％的工资，不退休还能干活，总比刚进厂的学徒强”。姜连风退休后，厂子里有技术问题，仍请他帮助解决。因为对老工人的使用、培养上存在着以上问题，有些老工人就悲观失望，觉着老了、没有用了。我们认为老工人有技术有经验，熟悉生产情况，是工业建设的重要力量。因此，在培养提高青年工人的同时，领导上也要注意到培养与提高老工人，提高他们的文化水平，使他们进一步学好一门专业技术，这对国家建设是迫切需要的。还要注意合理地使用老工人，使他们发挥老母鸡的作用，应给老工人以积极的鼓励和帮助；对于有劳动能力的老技术工人，不必一定动员退休，可以分配他们适当的工作，这对生产是有利的。
    第二、关于培养劳动模范问题。劳动模范开会多、负担重，不能经常参加生产，技术停顿，文化学习进步慢，像刘世梅代表几年来老学初中毕不了业，就是劳动模范本人也感到思想上负担很重。我们要求领导上注意减轻劳动模范的负担，减少会议，使他们专心生产。同时，我们感到领导同志对劳动模范开门见山的批评少，就是有了问题往往是绕着圈子谈或是不谈；还有的领导把劳动模范当成另一种人特殊对待，这就不是真正爱护劳动模范。劳动模范有了缺点或错误，如果领导同志不批评，群众当面不说，劳动模范的缺点或错误就不能改正，这对工作就没有好处。我们希望无论领导上和工人同志们不要把劳动模范当作另一种人特殊对待，而要实事求是地对劳动模范进行经常的教育和帮助，不要使他们脱离群众。
    第三、关于工厂警卫人员问题。工厂警卫人员多是从工人积极分子中挑选的，但他们待遇很低，从1951年至今170分，有的就免不了闹情绪。警卫人员是优秀的青年，如果调出来作工人，到现在一般可做三级到五级工人。我们认为除了适当解决工厂警卫人员的待遇问题以外，还要注意解决警卫人员的来源问题。
    第四、关于零售商品价格问题。我们发现北京有的商店随便提高商品价格。如黄润萍代表在东安市场里看了一个游泳裤叉当天没有去买，过天再买就涨了八分钱。这样随便的提高价格是不符合国家价格政策的，类似这样的情形，在买东西的时候还能碰到。我们认为有关部门对这种现象应切实检查加以纠正。商业部门应该对日常生活用品规定各种标准商品价格，并用适当方式向群众宣布。监察部门对物价政策的执行应该加强监督工作，以继续保持物价的平稳。
