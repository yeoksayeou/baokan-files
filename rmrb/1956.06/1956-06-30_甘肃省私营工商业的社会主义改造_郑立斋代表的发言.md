    The Socialist Transformation of Private Industry and Commerce in Gansu Province
    ——Speech by Representative Zheng Lizhai
    I fully agree with and support the reports and explanations made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Minister Liao Luyan to the conference. I will resolutely implement them in future work.
    After listening to Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report, I realized that the state's financial revenue and expenditure are balanced and stable, and the people of the whole country are carrying out peaceful construction, with all undertakings developing rapidly. I feel extremely excited and happy.
    I am an industrialist and businessman from Gansu Province, and also one of the responsible persons of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce. In the process of realizing joint state-private ownership, I, like all the industrialists and businessmen in the province, have received great enlightenment and education. I have further realized that the state’s policy of peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce is truly unprecedented. As a private industrialist and businessman, one should recognize the future, grasp one's destiny, abandon exploitation, and accept transformation, which is the only bright way out. The work of joint state-private ownership of private industry and commerce in our Gansu has been basically done well. After joint ownership, the turnover of most industries has been increasing month by month. Some private personnel have obtained very high positions, and they said, "It's really something they could never have dreamed of." At the same time, most of the public representatives discuss matters with the private personnel and respect their powers and responsibilities. Private personnel generally also play a positive role. However, there are still individual public representatives who do not trust private personnel very much and have different views on them. Some private personnel are constrained in their work and dare not take bold responsibility. No matter how big or small, urgent or not, they have to ask the public representatives for instructions, holding the attitude of "seeking no merit, but seeking no demerit" and "tolling the bell as a monk for a day." These are all wrong and should be corrected.
    The problems existing in private industry and commerce in Gansu Province after joint state-private ownership are roughly the same as those in the whole country. These problems have been pointed out by Vice Premier Chen Yun in his speech at this conference, and he has put forward reasonable solutions, which I wholeheartedly support. In the future, we should work hard, study hard, establish a labor point of view, get rid of capitalist ideological styles, and establish socialist ideological styles under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and also motivate our families to serve the people sincerely.
    The industrial construction in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, is developing rapidly, the population is constantly increasing, and the consumption is also growing day by day. The supply of goods is somewhat insufficient. For example, buying pork, eggs, and live chickens requires queuing, and the whole day's business can be completed in only one hour. Furthermore, white gloves for workers and glasses for construction sites are also in short supply. Especially in Gansu, which is a multi-ethnic region, some goods have become backlogged because their designs and varieties are not suitable for the needs of the people of all ethnic groups. Sometimes goods are stockpiled in warehouses while they are out of stock in the market. Sometimes, the procedures are too complicated, which affects the timely entry of goods into the market. Last year, the industrial and commercial tax and commercial income did not complete the task. I think there are certainly objective reasons for this, but the failure to supply goods in time and the decline in turnover will inevitably affect the industrial and commercial tax and commercial income, which is worth noting and improving.
    I would like to put forward some suggestions for the relevant departments to refer to. For example, regarding the pork problem, the township people's committees can conduct good publicity and explanation of the policy to the agricultural cooperatives, explaining the important relationship between the worker-peasant alliance, so that the agricultural cooperatives can raise pigs on a large scale and in a planned manner, or the purchasing departments and agricultural cooperatives can sign purchase contracts for regular acquisition. For pig feed, farmers should be allowed to keep a planned amount. If we do this, I think the shortage of meat can be solved. As for live chickens and eggs, they should also be purchased regularly in an organized manner, or entrusted to small merchants and peddlers to purchase, but we must prevent panic buying to avoid creating black markets. In this way, we can carry out the supply in a planned way, so as not to run out of stock. In terms of the designs and varieties of goods, we must meet the needs of all ethnic minority areas, absorb a large number of opinions from the masses, and use the experience of private personnel to hold regular forums to study and solve this problem. When purchasing goods, we can organize private personnel to cooperate in the work, so as to better adapt to consumer demand and seasonal needs. In addition, the second-level stations should be closely connected with the warehouses, simplify the procedures for picking up goods, and each wholesale station should preferably set up a sample room, so that we can know what goods are in stock every day, and the purchasers can trade after seeing the samples. In short, in our work, we should follow the mass line more, contact more, and inspect more, and these problems can be gradually solved.

### 甘肃省私营工商业的社会主义改造——郑立斋代表的发言

    甘肃省私营工商业的社会主义改造  
    ——郑立斋代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和廖鲁言部长向大会所作的报告和说明。并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    我听了李先念副总理的报告，体会到国家财政收支是平衡的，稳定的，全国人民正在进行和平建设，各项事业都是一日千里地向前发展。我觉得万分的兴奋和愉快。
    我是甘肃省的一个工商业者，也是省工商联的负责人之一。在实现公私合营的过程中，我同全省工商业者一样，受到很大的启发和教育，进一步认识到国家对资本主义工商业进行和平改造的政策，真是史无前例的。作为一个私营工商业者，应当认清前途，掌握命运，放弃剥削，接受改造，才是唯一的光明出路。我们甘肃私营工商业的公私合营工作基本上作得很好。大部分行业在合营以后，营业额逐月上升。一部分私方人员得到了很高的职位，他们说：“实在是梦想不到的。”同时，大多数公方负责人对私方人员遇事商量，尊重他们的职权；私方人员一般地也发挥了积极作用。但是还有个别公方负责人对私方人员不太信任，看法上还有区别；而有些私方人员在工作中束手束脚，不敢大胆负责，遇事不论大小缓急，都要请示公方，抱着“不求有功，但求无过”，“当一天和尚撞一天钟”的态度。这些都是不对的，应当改正过来。
    甘肃省私营工商业在公私合营后存在的问题，大体上同全国是差不多的。这些问题，陈云副总理在这次大会上的发言中已经指出来了，并且提出了合情合理的解决办法，我表示衷心拥护。今后我们应当在中国共产党和人民政府领导下努力工作，努力学习，建立劳动观点，去掉资本主义的思想作风，树立社会主义的思想作风，并且带动自己的家属，真诚地为人民服务。
    我们甘肃省的兰州市工业建设发展很快，人口不断增加，消费量也是一天比一天地增长，货源方面有些供应不上。譬如，买猪肉、鸡蛋、毛鸡，都要排队，整天的营业只有一个钟头就可以结束。再像工人用的白手套，工地上用的眼镜也都供不应求。尤其甘肃是多民族地区，有的货因为花色品种不适合各民族人民的需要，变为积压。也有时候把货压在仓库而市场脱销；有的因为手续过于繁多，影响货物迟迟不能进入市场。去年工商税和商业收入都没有完成任务，我认为这里面当然有客观原因，不过货物不能及时供应，营业额下降，也必然会影响到工商税和商业收入，这是值得注意和改进的。
    我想提出一些意见供有关部门参考。譬如猪肉问题，可以由乡人民委员会向农业社很好地宣传交代政策，说明工农联盟的重要关系，让农业社大量地有计划地养猪，或者由采购部门和农业社订立收购合同按期收购。对于养猪的饲料要有计划地给农民留出。这样作，我想可以解决缺肉现象。至于毛鸡和鸡蛋，也要有组织地经常收购，或者委托小商小贩收购，但是要防止抢购，以免造成黑市。这样就会有计划地进行供应，不致脱销。在货物花色品种方面，要适合各民族地区的需要，大量吸收群众意见，并且运用私方人员的经验，经常开座谈会，研究解决这个问题。在采购物品的时候，可以组织私方人员配合工作，以便更好地适应消费情况和季节需要。此外，二级站同仓库要密切连系，简化提货手续，各批发站最好设立样品室，仓库存的什么货天天都可以知道，采购员见到样品就可以进行交易。总之，在工作中多走群众路线，多联系，多检查，这些问题是可以逐步解决的。
