    China's Largest Zoo – The Beijing Zoo
    Guo An
    Sometimes people have a thought: wouldn't it be best to see lions and tigers not in iron cages, but running in the mountains? Now, this wish can be fulfilled at the Lion and Tiger Hill in the Beijing Zoo. Separated by a high wall and a small stream, visitors can clearly see lions and tigers appearing on the rock-built artificial mountains from above. Their occasional majestic roars scare children into hiding tightly behind their parents. On Lion and Tiger Hill, there are more than a dozen majestic and fierce lions and tigers, coming from the Northeast, East China, and Central South of the motherland, and some even from distant Africa and the Americas.

    The Beijing Zoo is currently the largest zoo in China. In the early days after liberation, there were only dozens of animals in the zoo. In the past few years, through extensive collection by the zoo and exchanges with zoos in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, and Japan, there are now more than 200 species of birds and animals in the zoo, totaling more than 1,100. Among them are: the vole and the crested gibbon from Hainan Island, the red panda from Sichuan, the Siberian tiger and mandarin ducks and swans from the Northeast; as well as the ostrich, zebra, and giraffe from Africa, the European bison from Eastern Europe, the Japanese white wisteria, the Arctic fox, and the snow leopard living in the high mountains. There are demoiselle cranes, capuchin monkeys, and beavers transported from the Soviet Union, as well as elephants and peacocks presented to China by India, Vietnam, and Burma, Père David's deer presented to China by the United Kingdom, and kangaroos recently transported from Australia.

    On holidays, the Beijing Zoo receives more than 100,000 visitors a day. The most attractive animals in the zoo are the three giant pandas. When they were first captured last year, each weighed only about 15 jin, but now they have grown to more than 100 jin. Their plump and round bodies are covered with milky white fluff, with black fur only on their shoulders and legs. The small round ears and the black circles around their eyes give their faces a comical appearance. In front of many visitors, the largest giant panda, called "Ping Ping," finished eating, lay down on its side, and covered its eyes with a furry forepaw. The giant panda is a rare and precious animal, with a small population and difficult to catch and raise. This animal is only produced in a few counties in Sichuan Province, China. Currently, no zoo in the world has this precious animal.

    Children are most interested in monkeys. They stop at the monkey house and refuse to leave, always pestering their parents to watch for a while longer. Inside the monkey house, a large group of monkeys, big and small, are playing and chasing each other mischievously. One little monkey has monopolized the swing, not allowing any other monkeys to play on it. In an instant, three or four monkeys pounced on it, throwing the little monkey down. Beside the corner of the building, a mother monkey tightly embraces her cub, born less than a week ago, with one hand, and holds the egg specially given to the cub by the keeper with the other. Four or five little monkeys squat nearby, watching it eat with envy.

    In a room next to Lion and Tiger Hill, a lion and a puppy live together. This is the little lion "Libi," just transported from Japan, and its foster mother "Merry." The little lion "Libi" has been raised by the mother dog "Merry" for more than nine months. Now the little lion is three or four times larger than its foster mother. They live together harmoniously. According to the keepers at the Ueno Zoo in Japan, "'Libi' is very docile and can be taken for a walk."

    On White Bear Hill, the guests from the distant Arctic seem to be living comfortably. Two little white bears are wrestling and biting each other in the water. Suddenly, with a splash, one little white bear jumped onto the shore, looking curiously at the surrounding visitors. Another little bear quietly climbed up and suddenly pounced on the first one, and immediately they both fell into the water, chasing and playing with a ball happily in the water.

    When visitors are a little tired of standing, they can stroll to the Waterfowl Lake, find a chair to rest, and comfortably overlook various waterfowl. On the rippling lake surface, a pair of black swans are swimming leisurely. They are precious gifts given to China by the Moscow Zoo. Around the black swans, there are pairs of mandarin ducks playing in the water. On the small island in the middle of the lake, graceful cranes and leisurely swans are stopping. It is so peaceful and beautiful here, making visitors feel relaxed and happy. (Attached photo)

    我国最大的动物园——北京动物园
    国安
    人们有时会有这样的想法：最好能看到不是关在铁笼子里的、而是奔窜在山岭间的狮虎。现在，这种愿望，在北京动物园的狮虎山上可以得到满足了。隔着一道很高的围墙和小溪，游客们从上面可以清楚地看到狮虎出没在石块砌成的假山上。它们偶尔发出了雄壮的咆哮声，吓得孩子们将身子紧紧躲藏在大人背后。狮虎山上，有十几头雄伟凶猛的狮子、老虎，它们来自祖国的东北、华东和中南，有的还来自遥远的非洲、美洲。
    北京动物园是我国目前最大的动物园。解放初期，园内只有几十只动物，几年来，经过动物园广泛的收捕和同苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国和日本等国家动物园的交换，现在园里已经有飞禽走兽二百多种，一千一百多只。其中有：海南岛的?鼠、冠叶猴，四川的小熊猫，东北虎和鸳鸯、天鹅；还有非洲的驼鸟、斑马、长颈鹿、东欧的野牛，日本的白芙蓉，北极白狐和生活在高山上的雪豹。有从苏联运来的戴冕鹤、卷尾猴、海狸等和印度、越南、缅甸送给我国的大象、孔雀，英国送给我国的四不像，和最近才运到的澳洲袋鼠。
    在假日里，北京动物园一天要接待十万多个游人。动物园内最吸引人的是三头大熊猫。它们在去年刚捕到时每头只有十五斤左右，现在已长到一百多斤了。肥胖浑圆的身上满是乳白色的茸毛，只有肩上和腿上是黑色的。小巧的圆耳朵和眼睛边的一圈黑斑，使它们的脸上显出一副滑稽相。在许多游人面前，那只最大的叫“平平”的大熊猫吃完了东西，侧身躺着，用一只毛茸茸的前掌遮着眼睛。大熊猫是稀有的珍贵动物，产量很少而又不易捕捉、饲养。只有我国四川省几个县出产这种动物。现在世界上还没有一个动物园有这种珍贵的动物。
    孩子们最感到兴趣的是猴子，他们走到猴楼站下后就再也不肯走开，总要磨缠着大人多看一会儿。猴楼内，一大群大大小小的猴子正在顽皮地追逐嘻闹。一只小猴独自霸住了秋千架，不让任何猴子上去玩。一瞬间，三、四只猴子扑了上去，把小猴子摔下来。楼角旁，一只母猴一手紧紧搂住它刚生下不到一星期的小猴，一手拿着饲养员特别给小猴吃的鸡蛋，四、五只小猴子蹲在一旁垂涎地看着它吃。
    在狮虎山旁的一间房内，一只狮子和一只小狗住在一起。这就是才从日本运来的小狮“里比”和它的乳母
  “梅莉”。小狮“里比”已经由母狗“梅莉”抚养九个多月了。现在小狮已经比它的乳母大了三、四倍。它们和睦地生活在一起。据日本上野动物园的饲养人员说：“‘里比’非常驯顺，可以牵着它出来散步。”
    在白熊山上，从遥远的北极来的客人看来生活得挺舒服。两只小白熊正在水中厮扑、扯咬，忽然泼刺一声，一只小白熊跳到了岸上，惊奇地望着四周的游人。另一只小熊也悄悄地爬了上来，猛然扑向先上岸的小白熊，一下子它们一齐跌到水中，又在水中快乐地追扑着皮球。
    游人们站得有点累了，可以漫步到水禽湖，找一把椅子休息一下，同时舒适地眺望各种水禽。泛着涟漪的湖面上，一对黑天鹅悠游着。它们是莫斯科动物园送给我国的珍贵礼物。黑天鹅周围，有一对对的鸳鸯在戏水。湖中间的小岛上，停站着潇洒挺秀的鹤和悠闲自得的天鹅。这里是那样的恬静优美，使游人们感到心旷神怡。（附图片）
