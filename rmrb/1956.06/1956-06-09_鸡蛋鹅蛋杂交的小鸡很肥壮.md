    Chicken hatched from hybridized chicken and goose eggs are very plump
    (Our newspaper, Kunming) The Jinshan Township Agricultural Cooperative in Tonghai County, Yunnan Province, hatched six chicks using a method of hybridizing chicken and goose eggs. These chicks have long bodies, wide beaks, large rumps, and relatively long necks and claws. They grew tails and wings only five days after hatching.
    This is the result of their first experiment. During the experiment, due to a lack of experience, some injected air into the eggs when injecting goose egg white, and some injected at the top of the egg, destroying the air cell inside the egg, so the hatching rate was not high. They are now summarizing their experiences and plan to conduct a second incubation.

    鸡蛋鹅蛋杂交的小鸡很肥壮
    本报昆明讯　云南通海县金山乡农业合作社试用鸡蛋鹅蛋杂交的办法孵出了六只小鸡。这些小鸡身子长，嘴宽，屁股大，脖子、爪子也较长；孵出后只五天就长尾巴、翅膀。
    这是他们第一次试验取得的成绩。在试验中，因为缺乏经验，有的注射鹅蛋蛋白的时候在鸡蛋内打进了空气，有的在鸡蛋头上注射，破坏了鸡蛋内的气室，所以出鸡率不高。现在他们正在总结经验，打算进行第二次孵化。
