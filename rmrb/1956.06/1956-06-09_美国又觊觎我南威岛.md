Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Ingersoll brazenly clamored that the United States would obstruct China from exercising its sovereignty over Nanwei Island in the Nansha Islands.

Ingersoll said when meeting with William Miller, a United Press reporter stationed in Taipei on the 7th, that "the U.S. government does not approve of the Communists extending their interests to this Pacific island." He said, "Any expansion of Communism is a concern of the U.S. government because containing Communism is our publicly declared policy."

Ingersoll emphasized that one of the responsibilities of the Seventh Fleet is to "ensure the security of countries that have security pacts with us." He even declared that "the responsibility of the Seventh Fleet includes the vast area of the Western Pacific."

Ingersoll's remarks once again exposed the U.S. conspiracy to infringe upon China's sovereignty over Nanwei Island. Prior to this, the "Manila Chronicle" quoted Philippine officials as predicting that the United States "will participate" in the conspiracy to seize China's Nansha Islands. These officials said, "Because Communist China has publicly declared its sovereignty over these islands, and because of the significance of these islands to the security of the Philippines and the U.S. Pacific defense chain, the United States cannot remain indifferent now." Philippine Foreign Minister Garcia also expressed a week ago that he wanted the United States to come out and "clarify" the ownership of the islands in the South China Sea.

    美国又觊觎我南威岛
    新华社8日讯　美国第七舰队司令英格索尔公然叫嚷美国要阻挠中国行使对南沙群岛中的南威岛的主权。
    英格索尔在七日接见合众社驻台北记者威廉·米勒说，“美国政府并不赞同共产党把它的利益扩展到这个太平洋岛屿”。他说，“共产主义的任何扩张都是美国政府所担心的，因为遏制共产主义是我们公开宣布的政策。”
    英格索尔强调第七舰队所负的责任之一是“保障同我们订有安全公约的各国的安全”。他甚至宣布，“第七舰队的责任包括西太平洋的广阔区域”。
    英格索尔的谈话再次暴露了美国企图侵犯中国领土南威岛主权的阴谋。在这以前，“马尼拉纪事报”就曾经援引菲律宾官员的话，预料美国“将会参与”侵占中国南沙群岛的阴谋。这些官员说，“由于共产党中国对这个群岛公开宣布了主权要求，由于这个群岛对菲律宾的安全和美国的太平洋防御锁链的意义，美国现在不能冷漠置之。”菲律宾外交部长加西亚在一星期前也表示要美国出来“澄清”南中国海岛屿的所有权。
