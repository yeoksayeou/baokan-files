Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 23rd: The Yumen Oilfield Refinery has ten products that were of previously substandard quality, and now all have reached or exceeded the national quality standards.

Starting in March of this year, the refinery used methods such as holding mobilization meetings and product quality exhibitions to conduct propaganda and education on improving product quality for all employees. In order to improve product quality, employees put forward fifty rationalization proposals related to improving product quality in March and April alone. The quality of diesel was not high in the past, but later the employees studied using heating sedimentation and alkali washing methods for processing, and as a result, the quality of diesel reached the prescribed standards. All employees also added dust covers to the oil tanks and cleaned some of the operating equipment, reducing impurities in the products.

In addition, the factory also adopted methods such as running training classes and signing apprenticeship contracts to improve the technical level of the employees. The product quality improvement team, composed of factory workers and technicians, also regularly studies and analyzes the reasons for the low product quality and proposes improvement methods. This series of measures and methods have played a significant role in improving product quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 23rd: As of the 20th, the Yumen Oilfield Refinery has successfully trial-produced three new products, including turbine oil and compressor cylinder oil, and has begun production. Thus far, the refinery has successfully trial-produced twelve new products this year, exceeding this year's new product trial-production plan.

Several of the newly trial-produced products are ones that China could not produce in the past. The successful trial production of these new products marks a new improvement in China's refining technology level.

    玉门油矿炼油厂产品质量提高
    今年试制成十二种新产品
    新华社玉门23日电　玉门油矿炼油厂有十种过去质量不高的产品，现在已经全部达到或超过了国家规定的质量标准。
    炼油厂从今年三月份开始，用召开动员大会和举办产品质量展览会等方法，向全厂职工进行了提高产品质量的宣传教育。职工们为了改进产品质量，仅三、四两月份，就提出了有关改进产品质量的合理化建议五十件。柴油的质量过去不高，后来职工们研究用加温沉淀和碱洗的办法进行处理，结果使柴油质量达到了规定的标准。全厂职工还在油罐上加添了防尘盖，清洁了部分的操作设备，减少了产品中的杂质。
    此外，厂内还采用办训练班、订师徒合同的方式，来提高职工们的技术水平。由厂内工人和技术人员组成的改善产品质量小组，也经常研究和分析产品质量不高的原因，并且提出改进的办法。这一系列的措施和办法，对提高产品质量都起了很大的作用。
    新华社玉门23日电　到二十日为止，玉门油矿炼油厂又有透平油和压缩机汽缸油等三种新产品试制成功，并且开始生产。至此，炼油厂今年已经试制成功了十二种新产品，超额完成了今年新产品的试制计划。
    新试制的产品当中，有好几种都是我国过去不能生产的。这些新产品的试制成功，标志着我国炼油技术水平又有了新的提高。
