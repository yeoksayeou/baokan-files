    新华社19日讯　曼谷消息：埃及驻印度尼西亚大使兼驻泰国公使阿里·安罗西六月十四日在曼谷向报界发表谈话说，埃及政府决定承认中国是从现实出发的，绝对没有受任何势力的影响。
    他说，毫无疑问，中国在亚洲是一个强大的国家。事实证明这个国家的政府是真正代表中国人民的，是中国合法的政府。
    阿里指出，亚非国家之间的团结合作，无疑对世界和平将有极大的贡献。他说，在目前形势下，如果中立国家能够比目前更增多，实力能够比目前更扩大，那么就更有希望实现世界和平，战争也就更容易制止。
    他还表示支持阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动。他说，埃及对阿尔及利亚的独立运动将给予全力支持和援助。
    阿里并且谴责了巴格达条约，他说，这个条约完全是由西方国家所策划和操纵的。他指出，由于阿拉伯国家的团结一致，已经使得巴格达条约无从发挥它的作用。
