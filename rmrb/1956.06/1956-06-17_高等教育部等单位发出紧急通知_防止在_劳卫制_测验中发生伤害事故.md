Xinhua News Agency, June 16th. Following the death of Li Yuanhua, a student at the Beijing Russian Language Institute, on May 26th due to a ten-kilometer weighted march under the "Labor and Defense System" test in hot weather, a similar incident occurred at the Nanjing Institute of Aeronautics on June 3rd. In response, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the Physical Culture and Sports Commission issued an emergency notice on June 15th regarding "Labor and Defense System" testing.

The notice stated: "Labor and Defense System" testing is a meticulous organizational task that must be planned in conjunction with the sports season, and should be strengthened in terms of organization, ideological guidance, and necessary material preparation. Especially now that we have entered the hot summer, injury accidents are very likely to occur if the testing work is not properly organized.

The notice requires that administrative leaders of all schools must effectively strengthen specific leadership over the "Labor and Defense System" testing; local Physical Culture and Sports Commissions and education administrative departments must strengthen inspection and guidance. Endurance events such as the "Labor and Defense System" ten-kilometer weighted march, travel-style walking march, cycling, three thousand, one thousand five hundred, eight hundred, and five hundred meters are generally not suitable for testing in the summer, and can be continued after the autumn cools down. If testing is necessary, it must be carried out in the early morning or evening; participants must have had sufficient training for the tested items, be in normal physical condition before the test, wear light-colored hats or headscarves during the test, and wear shoes to prevent heatstroke. During long-distance event tests, someone should patrol back and forth, reporting time and distance; first aid stations and tea stations should be set up along the way; physical education teachers and school doctors should be present to provide guidance. In order to take care of the actual difficulties of graduating students, if the ten-kilometer weighted march, travel-style walking march, or cycling and other items have not yet been tested, they can be exempted.

    高等教育部等单位发出紧急通知
    防止在“劳卫制”测验中发生伤害事故
    新华社16日讯　继五月二十六日北京俄语学院学生李元华因为在炎热天气下测验“劳卫制”项目十公里负重行军死亡以后，六月三日南京航空工业专科学校也发生了同样事件。为此，高等教育部、教育部和体育运动委员会在六月十五日向各地发出了关于“劳卫制”测验工作的紧急通知。
    通知中说：“劳卫制”测验是一项细致的组织工作，它必须有计划地结合运动季节来进行，并且应该加强组织、思想领导和做好必要的物质准备。特别是现在已经进入炎暑，如果测验工作组织不当，就极易发生伤害事故。
    通知要求各学校行政领导必须切实加强对“劳卫制”测验工作的具体领导；各地体育运动委员会、教育行政部门必须加强检查、指导。“劳卫制”十公里负重行军、旅行式步行行军、自行车、三千、一千五百、八百、五百公尺等耐力项目，一般不宜在夏季进行测验，可待秋凉后继续进行。如必要测验时，必须在早、晚进行；参加测验的人必须对受测的项目有了充分锻炼，在测验前身体状况正常，在测验时戴上浅色帽子或头巾，并且要穿鞋，以防止中暑。在长距离项目测验时，应有人来回巡查，报告时间、距离；沿途设立急救站和茶水站；体育教师和校医应该在场指导。为了照顾应届毕业生的实际困难，如到目前十公里负重行军、旅行式步行行军或自行车等项目还没进行测验的，可以免测。
