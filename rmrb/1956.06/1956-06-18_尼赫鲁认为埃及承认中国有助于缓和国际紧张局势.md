Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi – Prime Minister Nehru, in a private meeting with a reporter from the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Gomhuria," welcomed Egypt's recognition of the People's Republic of China. He said that Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser's action would help ease international tensions.

According to a report in today's "Hindustan Times," Nehru said in this conversation: "We recognized China many years ago, and since then, we have always advocated for its admission to the United Nations. We are pleased with Egypt's recognition of China because we believe that the non-recognition of China by some countries is a denial of one of the obvious facts in the world. Recognition of a country is not because you agree with their policies, but because they exist."

Nehru believes that Egypt's recognition of China will help ease tensions. He said: "As far as the United Nations is concerned, we have consistently supported, and will continue to support, the admission of the People's Republic of China."

In response to a question about military alliances, Nehru said: "I think the trend in the future will be away from such alliances. They may continue to exist in name, but not in substance or importance. They will gradually disappear."

Regarding the Algerian question, Nehru said: "If any progress is to be made in resolving the problem, the massacres in Algeria must stop immediately."

Nehru reiterated his call for France and Algeria to accept his proposal as a method for reaching an agreement.

The Indian Prime Minister said that the Algerian question cannot be resolved until a ceasefire is in place. He said that he had therefore suggested that direct negotiations be held between France and Algeria on the basis of France recognizing Algeria as an international reality with an independent status that does not belong to France. Nehru said that neither side has rejected or agreed to his proposal.

Nehru reiterated his call for France and Algeria to accept his proposal as a method for reaching an agreement.

Nehru said that he would discuss the Algerian problem with Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser during his upcoming visit to Cairo.

    尼赫鲁认为埃及承认中国有助于缓和国际紧张局势
    据新华社新德里讯　尼赫鲁总理在单独接见埃及“共和国报”记者的时候欢迎埃及承认中华人民共和国。他说，阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔中校采取的这个行动有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    据“印度斯坦时报”今天报道，尼赫鲁在这次谈话中说：“多年以前我们就承认了中国，从那时起，我们一直主张接纳它进入联合国。我们对于埃及承认中国一举感到高兴，因为我们认为，某些国家不承认中国就是不承认世界上的明显事实之一。承认国家并不是因为你同意它们的政策，而是因为它们的存在。”
    尼赫鲁认为埃及的承认中国有助于缓和紧张局势。他说：“就联合国而论，我们一贯支持，并且将继续支持接纳中华人民共和国。”
    尼赫鲁在答复关于军事同盟的问题的时候说：“我认为将来的趋势将是离开这种同盟。它们可能在名义上继续保持下去，但是在实质上和重要性上却并不是这样。它们将逐步消失。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到阿尔及利亚问题的时候说：“如果要在问题的解决上作出任何进展，那么在阿尔及利亚的屠杀就必须立即停止。”
    尼赫鲁再次要求法国和阿尔及利亚接受他的建议作为达成协议的方法。
    这位印度总理说，在停战以前，不能设法解决阿尔及利亚问题。他说，因此他曾经建议，在法国承认阿尔及利亚作为一个国际现实具有不属于法国的独立地位的基础上，由法国和阿尔及利亚进行直接的谈判。尼赫鲁说，还没有那一方拒绝或者同意他的建议。
    尼赫鲁再次要求法国和阿尔及利亚接受他的建议作为达成协议的方法。
    尼赫鲁说：他将在不久访问开罗时，同埃及总理纳赛尔讨论阿尔及利亚问题。
