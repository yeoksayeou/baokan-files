    More and More Problems Created
    In April, the Changzi County Committee of Shanxi Province sent Liu Zhenji, a staff member, to Beilizhuang to help the branch carry out party rectification work. After Liu Zhenji arrived in Beilizhuang, he neither relied on the branch's activists to carry out the work, nor did he criticize and educate the party members who had made mistakes. Instead, he kicked aside the branch organization and used crude methods to rectify the party. As soon as Liu Zhenji arrived in Beilizhuang, he first convened a mass meeting and elected some representatives at the mass meeting to be responsible for leading the party rectification work. Later, Liu Zhenji held successive mass meetings to mobilize the masses to offer opinions on the branch and party members, and he did not allow party members and cadres to attend the meetings. He neither investigated and analyzed the opinions raised by the masses, nor did he talk to the relevant party members. He then convened another mass meeting to allow the relevant party members to make self-criticisms at the meeting. Of course, their self-criticisms were not profound. Therefore, Liu Zhenji compiled the opinions raised by the masses into two written materials and forced them to sign and stamp them.
    This branch did have many problems. The party members were fighting for power and profit and were not united, which seriously affected the consolidation and development of the cooperative. However, after Liu Zhenji rectified it in this way, the original problems were not only not solved, but some new problems were added. This is a good lesson for those who like to use simple and crude attitudes to deal with ideological problems.

    问题越整越多
    四月间，山西长子县委会派工作人员刘振基到北李庄帮助支部进行整党工作。刘振基到北李庄后，既不依靠支部的积极分子进行工作，又不对有错误的党员进行批评教育，而是一脚踢开支部组织，用粗暴的方法去整党。刘振基一到北李庄，首先召开群众大会，在群众大会上选举出一些代表负责领导整党工作。以后刘振基又连续召开群众大会动员群众对支部、党员提意见，而且不让党员、干部参加大会。对群众提出来的意见，他既不做调查分析，也不找有关的党员谈话，就又召开群众大会，让有关党员在大会上进行检讨。这样，他们的检讨当然不能深刻。于是，刘振基就把群众提出的意见整理成两份书面材料，强迫他们签名盖章。
    这个支部确实存在不少问题，党员之间争权夺利，闹不团结，严重地影响了合作社的巩固和发展。可是经过刘振基这么一整，原有的问题不但没有解决，而且增加了一些新的问题。对于那些爱用简单粗暴的态度对待思想问题的人，这是一个很好的教训。
