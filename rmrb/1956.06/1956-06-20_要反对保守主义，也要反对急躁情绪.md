Since the second half of last year, we have been waging a struggle against conservatism, and this struggle has achieved significant results. Through this struggle, right-leaning conservative thinking has been profoundly criticized, and everyone has recognized the harm of right-leaning conservative thinking.

The overall situation of our country's work now is good, healthy, and constantly progressing. More than 90% of farmers nationwide have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, of which 61% of the total number of farmers nationwide have joined advanced cooperatives. As of the end of March, 88% of handicraft practitioners nationwide had joined handicraft producers' cooperatives. Nationwide, 92% of private industry, calculated by output value, has been transformed into joint state-private ownership. Nationwide, approximately 75% of private commerce, calculated by capital amount, has implemented joint state-private ownership. The progress of these transformations is normal. Inspired by the high tide of the socialist revolution, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and peasants is unprecedentedly high. This year, barring any other major disasters, a good agricultural harvest is assured. If we can increase the income of over 90% of cooperative members based on increased production, we can consolidate over one million agricultural producers' cooperatives and prepare favorable conditions for the transition of elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives to advanced cooperatives. In the industrial field, due to the unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and the widespread development of the advanced producer movement, we have the possibility of rapidly increasing industrial production and completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. These are all things that deserve our joy.

However, this does not mean that there are no shortcomings in our work now. Shortcomings are now manifested in two aspects. On the one hand, right-leaning conservative thinking is still at play in some work; on the other hand, in some work in the recent period, there has been a tendency towards impatience and rashness. Some things have been done too hastily, and some plans have been set too high, without fully considering practical possibilities. This is a new situation that has arisen after opposing conservatism. This situation deserves our serious attention.

Chairman Mao said: "People's thinking must adapt to the changed circumstances. Of course, no one can engage in unfounded speculation, nor can they plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances. Do not force yourself to do things that are really impossible." (Preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"). The current situation is precisely that some comrades have violated Chairman Mao's instruction, planned their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and insisted on doing things that are not yet possible for the time being.

This situation exists to a greater or lesser extent in many aspects of work. In terms of rural work, the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program were originally intended to be implemented in five, seven, and twelve years respectively, but some comrades, because of their eagerness for quick results, attempted to accomplish all these things in two or three years. This tendency has been manifested in the formulation of production increase plans, in agricultural capital construction, and in cultural and welfare facilities. Due to the one-sided emphasis on the increase of grain and cotton production, rural sideline production has been reduced. Also, because of excessive productive and non-productive investments, the increase of farmers' income has been affected. The rural literacy campaign is also a prominent example of impatience and rashness. The Central Committee's requirement was originally to basically eliminate illiteracy among urban and rural residents in five to seven years, but in some provinces it became four and five years, and in some counties it became three years. The shorter the time, the further down the hierarchy it went. Now is the busy farming season, but a small number of rural literacy activists, regardless of this situation, occupy farmers' rest time to promote literacy, forcing farmers to doze off in the classroom. Some individual places even set up literacy posts and roadblock literacy stations, forcing the masses to recognize words. The enthusiasm of these activists is good, but they are using the wrong methods. The result of their actions, apart from creating tension in the countryside, hindering farmers' production, and causing farmers to complain, will not achieve good results. In 1952, we already had an experience in literacy campaigns, which was a bit too rushed at the time, and then contracted too quickly, to the point that most places simply stopped altogether. Stopping is wrong. Literacy work should be actively carried out, but this time we have done it too quickly in many places. The correct approach should be to promote this work actively and prudently in accordance with the principle of "learn more when not busy, learn less when slightly busy, and stop learning when very busy," correcting both the tendency of rash advance and preventing and opposing cancellationism.

There are many similar situations in industrial production and construction. Some industrial production plans, when formulated, did not fully consider the source of materials and the balance of supply, production, and sales. The plans were unrealistic, making their implementation very difficult. The production plan for double-wheeled double-shared plows was set too high, without considering the conditions of paddy fields in the south, resulting in a large backlog in many places in the south, which is one example. The formulation of many basic construction plans did not effectively study the supply of building materials and machinery and equipment, nor did it make full preparations for design and installation forces, resulting in some phenomena of work stoppages and wasted manpower. In some factories, mines, and basic construction sites, in carrying out the advanced producer movement, the emphasis on "breaking the rules" was inappropriate, resulting in an increase in accidents, affecting the safety of workers, and also affecting the normal progress of production and construction projects. The quotas in some production units were set too high, making it impossible for most workers to reach them, which affected the workers' production mood. Some places went too far in the issue of economy in basic construction, resulting in factory buildings and dormitories being built with too poor quality and unsuitable for use.

The reason why impatience has become a serious problem is that it exists not only among cadres at the lower levels but also primarily among leading cadres of various systems at the upper levels. Many of the rash advances at the lower levels are forced out by the upper levels. As soon as the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program came out, various systems were unwilling to be called right-leaning conservatives by others, and they all rushed to assign work to the lower levels with overly high standards, issuing directives item by item, and demanding them very urgently. Each department hoped to achieve results in its work quickly. Dozens of ministries in the central government, one item per ministry, passed down level by level, even increasing the burden level by level, which the lower levels inevitably could not bear. The central government is now taking a series of measures to correct this impatience that does not distinguish between priorities and disregards specific circumstances. The tendency of rash advance in the work of various departments and various localities, some of which have been corrected, some of which have not been corrected, or corrected incompletely, but as an ideological tendency, it cannot be completely overcome at once, and we need to pay attention to it frequently in the future.

Why has the tendency of blind advance occurred in some work after opposing right-leaning conservatism? This is mainly due to the one-sidedness of our thinking methods. Because we did not use the dialectical method, and did not comprehensively observe problems from the complex contradictions and connections of things, but only looked at problems from one aspect and one angle, we regarded many problems as too rigid and too absolute. Also, due to the lack of in-depth investigation and research work, our understanding of the actual situation is insufficient, we are clueless, and there is blindness. In this case, it is of course easy to be biased on one side and commit one-sidedness when dealing with things. After opposing conservatism, especially after the central government proposed the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and issued the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)," a one-sidedness arose in the minds of many comrades. They thought that since we must oppose conservatism, since the policy is "more, faster, better, and more economical," since we must implement the forty articles, then all work, regardless of urgency or importance, and regardless of whether objective conditions are possible, should be pursued with quantity and speed, with all undertakings thriving and advancing in unison, attempting to accomplish everything in one morning. This shift from one extreme to another will inevitably lead to mistakes.

Right-leaning conservative thinking is harmful to our cause, and impatient and rash thinking is also harmful to our cause, so both tendencies must be opposed. Of course, we must continue to pay attention to criticizing and overcoming various manifestations of right-leaning conservative thinking in the future to ensure that the socialist construction cause develops forward without hindrance. However, while opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, we should not neglect or relax the opposition to impatient and rash tendencies. Only by opposing both right-leaning conservative thinking and impatient and rash thinking can we move forward correctly.

We must adopt a realistic attitude on the issue of opposing conservatism and rash advance. What is right-leaning conservatism, and what is rash advance? There is an objective standard here, and this standard is the objective actual possibility. The correct working method is to make our plans and steps conform to the objective actual possibility. Anything that lags behind the objective actual possibility is right-leaning conservatism; anything that exceeds the actual possibility is rash advance. In your region, in your department, is there right-leaning conservatism, is there rash advance, which is right-leaning conservatism, which is rash advance, is right-leaning conservatism the main problem, or is rash advance the main problem, how serious is right-leaning conservatism, how serious is rash advance? These must be specifically analyzed, and you can't just imagine them out of thin air. It is also possible that in the work of the same department or the same region, it is right-leaning conservatism in one matter and rash advance in another. We should make judgments based on facts, oppose whatever tendency there is, and correct whatever mistake there is, and never do things in a gust of wind, expand the scope, and turn everything into opposing conservatism, or turn everything into opposing rash advance. If the opposition is excessive, it will oppose one side and create a bias on the other side, which will be harmful to the work instead.

We must have a correct understanding of the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy proposed by the central government, and do not make it one-sided and absolute, so that we will not go to rash advance. The general policy is to be more, faster, better, and more economical, but in specific work, which things can be more and faster, which things cannot be more and faster, which things can be more and faster now, which things can only be more and faster in the future, what counts as saving appropriately, how can we be both more, faster, and more economical, while still achieving good results? These must be carefully and realistically considered based on the specific situation. You cannot see the problem as too rigid or too simple. When implementing the central government's policy, we must not only pay attention to more and faster, but also not pay attention to better and more economical. We must not cause waste due to greed for more and faster, nor can we neglect the quality and safety of work due to seeking more, faster, more economical. If it is more, faster, and more economical, but not good or unsafe, then it is a violation of our purpose. The problem of implementing the forty articles is also the same. Of course, the various regions and departments must resolutely implement the forty articles, but the methods and steps of implementation can vary according to the different objective conditions in various places, and there is no need to force uniformity. In short, in doing any work, we must be good at combining the policies and requirements from above with the actual conditions of our region and unit, and consider and determine our own work steps from the actual situation. Only in this way can we avoid making the mistake of right-leaning conservatism or rash advance.

### 要反对保守主义，也要反对急躁情绪

    要反对保守主义，也要反对急躁情绪
    自从去年下半年以来，我们进行了反对保守主义的斗争，这个斗争已经收到重大
  的效果。经过了这场斗争，右倾保守思想已受到深刻的批判，大家都已认识到右倾保
  守思想的危害。
    现在我们国家工作总的情况是好的，健康的，是在不断进步中的。现在全国已有90％以上的农户加入了农业生产合作社，其中加入高级合作社的已占全国总农户的61％。截至三月底，全国已有88％的手工业从业人员加入了手工业生产合作社。全国私营工业，以产值计算，已有92％转成了公私合营。全国私营商业，以资本额计算，已有75％左右实行了公私合营。这些改造工作的进展都是正常的。在社会主义革命高潮的鼓舞下，广大工农群众的生产热情空前高涨。今年如无其他重大灾害，农业的良好收成是肯定了的。如果我们能在增加生产的基础上使90％以上的社员都增加收入，那就可以使一百多万个农业生产合作社巩固下来，并且为初级农业生产合作社转入高级社准备下有利的条件。在工业方面，由于广大职工群众生产积极性的空前高涨和先进生产者运动的广泛开展，我们已有可能迅速地提高工业生产和提前完成第一个五年计划。这些都是值得我们高兴的。
    但这并不是说现在我们的工作中便没有缺点了，缺点现在是表现在两个方面，一方面是在一些工作中仍然有右倾保守思想在作怪，另一方面是在最近一个时期中在有些工作中又发生了急躁冒进的偏向，有些事情做得太急了，有些计划定得太高了，没有充分考虑到实际的可能性。这是在反保守主义之后所发生的一种新情况。这种情况是值得我们严重注意的。
    毛主席说：“人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况。当然，任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言）。现在的情况正是有些同志违背了毛主席的这一指示，超越了客观情况所允许的条件去计划自己的行动，去硬办一些一时还办不到的事情。
    这种情况在许多方面的工作中都或多或少地存在着。就农村工作来说，全国农业发展纲要四十条本来是要在五年、七年和十二年内分别加以实现的，但有些同志因为心急图快，企图在两三年内即把这些事情全部做好。在制定增产计划方面，在农业基本建设方面，在文化福利设施方面，都已表现出这样一种偏向。由于片面地强调了粮、棉的增产，缩小了农村的副业生产，又由于生产性和非生产性的投资过多，这样就影响了农民收入的增加。农村的扫盲工作也是急躁冒进的一个突出的例子。中央的要求本来是要在五年至七年内基本上扫除城市和农村居民中的文盲，但到某些省里就成了四年和五年，到某些县里成了三年，愈到下面时间定得愈短。现在正值农忙时期，但有少数农村扫盲积极分子不管这一情况，占用农民的休息时间来扫盲，使农民只好在课堂上打瞌睡。个别的地方甚至设立识字岗、拦路识字站，强迫群众认字。这些积极分子的热情是好的，但是他们用错了方法。他们这样做的结果，除了造成农村紧张，妨碍农民生产，招致农民埋怨之外，并收不到好的效果。在1952年的时候，我们已有过一次扫盲的经验，那次就扫得急了一些，以后又收缩得急了，以至大部分地方干脆完全停止了。停止是不对的，扫盲工作是应当积极地进行的，但我们这次在很多地方又做得急了。正确的办法应当是按照“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙停学”的原则，积极而又稳妥地推进这一工作，既要纠正冒进的偏向，又要防止和反对取消主义。
    工业的生产和建设方面也有不少类似的情况。有些工业生产计划在制定的时候，没有充分考虑材料的来源和供产销的平衡问题，计划订得不切实际，使计划的执行发生很大困难。双轮双铧犁的生产计划定得过高，没有考虑到南方水田的条件，以致在南方许多地方大量积压，就是一个例子。许多基本建设计划的制定，也没有切实研究建筑材料和机器设备的供应，没有对设计力量安装力量作充分的准备，以致发生某些停工窝工的现象。有些厂矿和基本建设工地在开展先进生产者运动中，不恰当地强调了一切“打破常规”，结果使事故增加，影响到工人的安全，也影响到生产和建设工程的正常进行。有些生产单位的定额订得过高，使大多数工人无法达到，影响了工人的生产情绪。有些地方在基本建设的节约问题上做得过火，结果厂房和宿舍建筑起来，质量太坏，并且不合用。
    急躁情绪所以成为严重的问题，是因为它不但是存在在下面的干部中，而且首先存在在上面各系统的领导干部中，下面的急躁冒进有很多就是上面逼出来的。全国农业发展纲要四十条一出来，各个系统都不愿别人说自己右倾保守，都争先恐后地用过高
  的标准向下布置工作，条条下达，而且都要求得很急，各部门都希望自己的工作很快做出成绩来。中央几十个部，每个部一条，层层下达，甚至层层加重，下面就必然受不了。现在中央已经在采取一系列的措施，纠正这种不分轻重缓急，不顾具体情况的急躁情绪。各个部门和各个地方的工作中的冒进倾向，有些已经纠正，有些还未纠正，或纠正得不彻底，但作为一种思想倾向，则不是一下子所能彻底克服的，需要我们在今后经常注意。
    为什么在反对了右倾保守之后，在有些工作中又发生了盲目冒进的偏向呢？这主要是由于我们思想方法上的片面性造成的。由于没有运用辩证的方法，没有从事物的复杂的矛盾和联系中去全面地观察问题，只从一个方面、一个角度去看问题，就把许多问题看得太死，太绝对化。又由于缺少深入的调查研究工作，对实际情况了解得不够，心中无数，有盲目性，在这种情况下，处理事情当然就容易偏于一面，发生片面性。在反保守主义之后，特别是中央提出“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针和发布“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”之后，在许多同志的头脑中就产生了一种片面性，他们以为既然要反对保守主义，既然方针是“又多、又快、又好、又省”，既然要执行四十条，于是一切工作，不分缓急轻重，也不问客观条件是否可能，一律求多求快，百废俱兴，齐头并进，企图在一个早晨即把一切事情办好。这样由一个极端到另一个极端，当然免不了要犯错误。
    右倾保守思想对我们的事业是有害的，急躁冒进思想对我们的事业也是有害的，所以两种倾向都要加以反对。今后我们当然还要继续注意批判和克服右倾保守思想的各种表现，以保证社会主义建设事业不受阻碍地向前发展。但是在反对右倾保守思想的时候，我们也不应当忽略或放松了对急躁冒进倾向的反对。只有既反对了右倾保守思想，又反对了急躁冒进思想，我们才能正确地前进。
    在反对保守主义和急躁冒进的问题上，要采取实事求是的态度。什么是右倾保守，什么是急躁冒进，这里是有一个客观标准的，这个标准就是客观实际的可能性。正确的工作方法，就是要使我们的计划、步骤符合于客观实际的可能性。凡是落后于客观实际的可能性的，就是右倾保守；凡是超过了实际的可能性的，就是急躁冒进。在你们这个地区、这个部门中，有没有右倾保守，有没有急躁冒进，哪些是右倾保守，哪些是急躁冒进，右倾保守是主要的，还是急躁冒进是主要的，右倾保守严重到什么程度，急躁冒进严重到什么程度，这些都要具体加以分析，不能凭空想像。也可能在同一个部门、同一个地区的工作中，在这件事上是右倾保守，在另外一件事上又是急躁冒进。我们应当根据事实下判断，有什么偏向就反对什么偏向，有多大错误，就纠正多大错误，万不可一股风，扩大化，把什么都反成保守主义，或者都反成急躁冒进。如果反得过火，就会反了一面，又造成另一方面的偏向，于工作反而有害。
    我们对中央提出的“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针要有一个正确的了解，不要把它片面化、绝对化，这样才不会走到急躁冒进。总的方针是要又多、又快、又好、又省，但在具体的工作中，哪些能又多又快，哪些不能又多又快，哪些是现在就可以又多又快的，哪些是将来才能又多又快的，怎样才算省得恰当，怎样既多、既快、既省，而又能达到好的目的，这些都要根据具体情况仔细地、实事求是地去加以考虑，不能把问题看得太死，太简单。在执行中央的这条方针的时候，不能只注意多和快，而不注意好和省，既不能因贪多图快而造成浪费，也不能因求多求快求省而忽视工作的质量和安全。如果多了，快了，省了，但是不好，不安全，那就是违背了我们的目的。执行四十条的问题也是这样。四十条，各个地区、各个部门当然都是要坚决地加以执行的，但执行的方法和步骤，则是可以因各地客观条件的不同而有所不同的，用不着强求一致。总之，做任何工作，都要善于把上面的方针、要求与本地区、本单位的实际情况结合起来，从实际情况出发去考虑和确定自己的工作步骤。只有这样，才不致于犯右倾保守或急躁冒进的错误。
