Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The National Labor Union's Labor Insurance, Living, and Housing Work Conference closed on the 9th.

    The "Social Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" (draft), which was drafted during the conference, suggests expanding the scope of labor insurance to all enterprises, institutions, organs, schools, and organizations' employees, and the insurance benefits have also been generally improved. The draft will soon be submitted to the State Council for approval and implementation. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also decided at the meeting to allocate a huge sum from the accumulated labor insurance funds over the years to provide relief to employees who are in debt due to illness.

    During the half-month conference, representatives from various central ministries and responsible cadres from various industries and regional labor unions studied issues related to employees' living welfare such as social insurance, employee housing, rent, water and electricity, transportation costs, medical and health care, nurseries, and canteens.

    The meeting pointed out that in the past few years, the material and cultural living conditions of employees have greatly improved, but there are still considerable shortcomings in many enterprises and other departments in further caring for the living welfare of employees. The representatives criticized some enterprises and other departments that do not care about the living welfare of employees.

    The representatives focused on examining the serious deficiencies in employee housing and the excessively high rent in some areas. The number of employees in some industries (such as railways) has increased by more than 78% since liberation, while housing has only increased by less than 60%. The number of employees in Shenyang has increased more than twofold in recent years, while employee housing has only increased by about 31%. Some enterprises have unreasonable rent regulations, and the rent for renting private houses is too high, reaching as high as about 20% of employees' wages. In addition, some cities have unreasonable utility charges, insufficient living supplies for employees, excessive medical expenses, unreasonable hospital deposit systems, and many problems in transportation and canteens.

    The meeting believes that due to the development of the national economy and the improvement of labor productivity, the living welfare of employees must be further improved. Correspondingly improving the living welfare of employees not only does not violate the principle of developing production, but also can improve the enthusiasm of the masses of employees, thereby helping to further improve production.

    In response to the current problems, the meeting formulated some specific solutions, such as suggesting that various industrial departments and agencies build housing in proportion to the increase in employees, and strive to solve the housing problems of the original employees within a certain period. It was also suggested that relevant departments take measures to adjust rent reasonably and systematically to reduce the burden on employees, and provide appropriate care for employees with low wages and large families.

    Self-construction with public assistance is another measure suggested at the meeting to solve the housing problem. A method proposed at the meeting suggested allocating sufficient land to employees who build their own houses and asking the People's Construction Bank of China to provide low-interest loans for assistance.

    工会劳动保险生活住宅工作会议闭幕
    新华社11日讯　全国工会劳动保险生活住宅工作会议，在九日闭幕。
    在会议期间草拟成的“中华人民共和国社会保险条例”（草案），建议把劳动保险的范围扩大到一切企业、事业、机关、学校、团体的职工，保险的待遇也普遍提高了。草案即将提请国务院批准实行。中华全国总工会并且在会上决定从历年结余的劳动保险基金中提出巨款来救济因病而负债的职工。
    在半个多月的会议期间，出席会议的中央各部的代表和来自各产业、各地区工会的负责干部，研究了社会保险、职工住宅、房租、水电、交通费、医疗卫生、托儿所、食堂等有关职工生活福利的问题。
    会议指出，过去几年来，职工的物质和文化生活条件已经有了很大的改善，但是在进一步关心职工的生活福利方面，不少企业和其他部门还存在着相当严重的缺点。代表们对一些不关心职工生活福利的企业和其他部门提出了批评。
    代表们着重检查了职工住宅方面存在的严重不足以及某些地区房租过高的问题。有些产业（如铁路）的职工人数解放以来增长了78％以上，而住宅仅增长了不到60％。沈阳市职工人数几年来增长了两倍多，而职工住宅仅增长了31％左右。有些企业房租规定不合理，租赁私人房屋的房租过高，竟有高达职工工资20％左右的。此外，某些城市的公用事业收费不尽合理，职工生活供应不足，医药费过高，住医院的押金制度不合理，以及交通、食堂等方面也有不少问题。
    会议认为，由于国民经济的发展和劳动生产率的提高，职工的生活福利也必须进一步改善。相应地改善职工的生活福利不仅不违背发展生产的原则，而且可以提高职工群众的积极性，从而有助于生产的进一步提高。
    针对目前存在的问题，会议制定了一些具体解决方案，如建议各产业部门和机关按职工增长的比例兴建住宅，并且争取在一定时期内解决原有职工的住宅问题。还建议有关部门采取措施，有计划地合理地调整房租，以减轻职工的负担，对工资低而家庭人口多的职工应给予适当的照顾。
    自建公助是会上建议推广的另一项解决住宅问题的措施。会上提出的一项办法建议对自建住宅的职工拨给充分的土地，并且请中国人民建设银行给以低利贷款协助。
