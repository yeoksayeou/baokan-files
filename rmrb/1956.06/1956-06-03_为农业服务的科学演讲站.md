    Science Lecture Stations Serving Agriculture
    In order to promote agricultural science and technology knowledge and support the agricultural cooperative movement, the Fujian Provincial Association for Science and Technology Popularization has established seven agricultural science lecture stations since February this year. Here we introduce the Fuzhou Kuiqi Agricultural Science Lecture Station, which was established the earliest.
    The teachers at this lecture station are mostly professors and students from the Fujian Agricultural College. They often give lectures in conjunction with current agricultural activities and specifically help farmers solve problems in production, which is of great benefit to agricultural and sideline production.
    This lecture station is very popular among farmers. Many farmers come to listen from more than ten miles away and spread the knowledge they have gained to other farmers. Photo by Ye Dakai (Draft from Fujian Daily) (with picture)

    After listening to the lectures, members of the Kuiqi Agricultural Production Cooperative have been able to correctly use "666" powder, which has improved the efficiency of insecticidal operations.
    The cooperative's potatoes have had a bumper harvest. Lin Jingliang (first person on the right in the front row), a professor of soil and fertilizer science in Fujian Province, and staff from the science lecture station personally went to the fields to summarize experience.

    为农业服务的科学演讲站
    为了推广农业科学技术知识，支援农业合作化运动，福建省科学技术普及协会从今年二月份起先后建立了七个农业科学演讲站。这里介绍的就是建立最早的福州魁歧农业科学演讲站。
    这个演讲站的教员大都是福建农学院的教授和学生，他们经常结合当前农事活动作演讲，具体帮助农民解决生产中的问题，对农业和副业生产有很大的好处。
    这个演讲站深受农民的欢迎，许多农民都从十里路以外赶来旁听，并且把得到的知识传播给其他农民。　叶大开摄（福建日报社稿）（附图片）
