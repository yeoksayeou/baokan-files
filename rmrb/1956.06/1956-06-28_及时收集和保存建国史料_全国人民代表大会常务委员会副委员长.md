    "After more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, finally achieved a great victory in the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in 1949... and established the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship." This is a very correct and glorious statement in the "Preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China."

    We will all think this way: A grand and unprecedented national construction edifice, from the day it started, a large group of people exerted their unparalleled labor force and collective wisdom, following the instructions of the engineers, "the ax wielder moves to the left, the saw wielder moves to the right," everyone must feel how exciting it is to be a worker in such a great project! But thinking deeper: we will also think that this building will be passed on to future generations, then, decades, hundreds of years, thousands of years, generations of descendants will definitely seek the original construction drawings from afar, the detailed construction rules are there, they will also seek the ax used in the original project from afar, the saw is there.

    Comrades! As a worker in the national construction project of the People's Republic of China, no matter what position you stand on, you should solemnly remind yourself: your work will be watched by future generations. All work records, work tools will be preserved by future generations. General cultural relics from thousands of years ago are still cherished and protected by historians, and the government strictly prohibits destruction. Moreover, today's revolution in New China is to build a socialist society, especially to eliminate exploitation and poverty and build a prosperous and happy socialist society through peaceful means. It is such an unprecedented and grand scale of national construction.

    Let's think about it: which one is not something that predecessors have never done before? Which one is not greatly worth commemorating? Industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, railways, transportation, post and telecommunications, commerce, science, culture, education, health, etc., etc., are countless, and are all gradually carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation. In particular, the great victory of the national policy, such a large and complex China, so many ethnic groups have united into a big family that loves each other like brothers and sisters.

    Every kind of work may have some problems, what problems? How to solve them? Aren't they worth solemnly recording?

    Since the founding of New China, our country's position in international affairs has become increasingly important, and we have made world-renowned contributions to the cause of world peace. The Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, proposed in the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India, have been widely used internationally, opening up avenues for resolving certain international disputes and creating positive factors for the cause of world peace. Aren't these international documents of the past few years worth cherishing and preserving well!

    We must recognize that "land reform" is a major event of paramount importance, and now the "land reform" movement has been completed. On the basis of "land reform," a high tide of agricultural cooperation has further emerged. The number of farmers who have joined advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives has reached 61.1% of the total number of farmers in the country. But "land reform" is not only a liberation movement for hundreds of millions of Chinese farmers, but also has great international significance, isn't it worth commemorating!

    Take the China Democratic National Construction Association, which is responsible for assisting the state in uniting, educating, and transforming industrialists and businessmen, for example. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it has cooperated with the government in various reasonable measures that are appropriate to the time and place, how to carry out propaganda and education, how to reflect opinions and situations to explain problems, how to cultivate backbone elements, and play a leading, exemplary, and bridging role, steadily advancing step by step. The leadership has put in a lot of effort, and the purpose is to combine with China's actual situation and educate the general capitalists who were judged by Marx in the first volume of "Das Kapital," Chapter 24, that the death knell has sounded and the expropriators have been expropriated, in our China to become self-reliant labor citizens through various methods of utilization, restriction, encouragement, and guidance in Article 10 of the first chapter of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Aren't these various documents, various work records, and factual reports worth greatly commemorating?

    Unsurprisingly, many countries in the world, especially countries with social systems different from ours, have one visiting delegation after another, more and more frequently coming to China to ask for answers to their questions. They honestly say that they used to be skeptical of communism. But in fact, there is such a country that is becoming richer and stronger day by day, and 600 million people believe in this ideology. They must see it with their own eyes and hear it with their own ears. What they don't understand the most is, such a big country, so many ethnic groups, what methods are used to make everyone happily unite? What methods are used to never have inflation? Especially what methods are used to make capitalists happily accept socialist transformation step by step? In the eyes of friends from countries with social systems different from ours, these are simply "miracles," and they want to understand these methods, they must study these documents.

    Therefore, I advocate that the state must promptly collect and preserve these historical materials well, and organize them. There should be a general institution at the central level, which should of course be fully controlled by the Academy of Sciences. The State Council's decision to strengthen national archival work, announced on April 16 this year, is very important. In addition to historical archives, there should also be historical materials - including historical documents, cultural relics, investigation reports, statistical data, etc. - I believe that in addition to the Academy of Sciences' full control, it should be based on the State Council's regulations: each ministry, each commission, each directly affiliated institution, each province, each autonomous region, the people's committees of municipalities directly under the central government, each department, bureau, each special and county-level organ, each enterprise unit and people's organization, these should originally be required to set up archives or archives management offices in accordance with the State Council's decision, and these organs should be responsible for collecting and preserving these historical materials at the same time. I believe, and I hope, that the Academy of Sciences will formulate methods. - I advocate that political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties should also set up archives and data rooms like people's organizations. I also think that people's congresses at all levels should also have the same settings. - Aren't the speeches of the representatives very valuable materials every time?

    We must recognize that if we don't do this work well, although these incredibly precious historical materials are being produced every day, some of them are being lost and destroyed every day.

    We must recognize that these incredibly precious historical materials are created by the sweat of countless labor heroes. Especially in this long-term revolution, only through one scene after another of highly arduous struggle can these creations be made. We should recognize with infinite solemnity, reverence, and excitement that a large part of these incredibly precious historical materials is the blood of thousands of people's heroes.

    Is my suggestion appropriate? Please advise.

    Simply attach a report on the inspection of the rural areas in the suburbs and counties of Beijing.

    I inspected the "Spark" in the suburbs of Beijing, "Lucheng" in Daxing County, Tong County Prefecture, and "Shiyang" three advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives in Liangxiang County, and also talked with the Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, the Commissioner of Tong County Prefecture, and the County Magistrate of Tong County. - 1956, 5, 28-6, 8.

    All cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing and Tong County Prefecture have been fully advanced. Land dividends are completely gone. The proportion of farmers joining the cooperatives in the total number of farmers is 99.6% in the suburbs of Beijing and 99.52% in Tong County Prefecture.

    The income of farmers who have joined the cooperatives has increased. This year, the cooperatives have made guarantees. It is estimated that the increase in income of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing and Tong County Prefecture in the summer harvest distribution can generally meet the requirements of the central government.

    The farmers' enthusiasm for production is very high, which is reflected in the widespread collective fertilizer accumulation movement last winter, which completed the task of applying 1,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.

    Equal pay for equal work for men and women has been generally implemented. "Spark" used competition methods to overcome the initial idea of male workers looking down on female workers.

    Sixty years ago, the Yongding River flooded, and "Lucheng" township became saline-alkali land with very little income. Now, after soil improvement, rice is being tried, electric pumps have been installed, and a labor upsurge has been set off.

    A common problem is the insufficient supply of machines, especially pumps.

    I also visited the Nanyuan Tractor Station in the suburbs of Beijing. It is planned to contract all the plowing, harrowing, sowing, and weeding work on 350,000 mu of land south of the new canal in the suburbs. The problem is that the machine room is not enough, and the 17 new tractors are placed in the open air. The station has proposed a building plan, but the higher authorities have not yet approved it. I suggest that the municipal government handle it quickly.

    Representatives! Speaking of preserving historical data since the founding of the country, we cannot but think of the particularly great achievements of the national construction work in the past year. At this time last year, only 14% of farmers in China had joined cooperatives, and now the number of farmers who have joined has reached 90.4% of the total number of farmers, and at this meeting, we will also pass the model regulations of advanced cooperatives to adapt to the requirements of the situation; last year, there were only a few factories and shops that were jointly owned by public and private enterprises, and now capitalist industry and commerce have all been jointly owned by public and private enterprises; last year, we passed the first five-year plan, and at this meeting, we know from Vice Premier Li Xiannian's budget and final accounts report and the speeches of other department heads that it will definitely be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

    In addition, the victorious completion of the anti-rightist movement, the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for Twelve Years, the formulation of the Scientific Long-Range Plan for Twelve Years, and the proposal of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the rich and colorful year of 1956, which one does not make people happy and excited!

    The great achievements of this year will always be the most glorious page in the history of our country, and will always be the most valuable historical data. Every worker in the national construction edifice is proud of this great achievement. Representatives! Let us cheer for this year of great change, great development, and great victory! Let us cheer for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who led the Chinese people in achieving such great and glorious achievements in the construction of the national construction edifice!

    及时收集和保存建国史料
    ——全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长
              黄炎培的发言
    “中国人民经过一百多年的英勇奋斗，终于在中国共产党领导下，在1949年取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，……建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。”这是“中华人民共和国宪法序言”上很正确地辉煌地这样写着的。
    我们大家会这样想：一座空前伟大的建国大厦，从开工那天起，一大群人发挥他们无比强度的劳动力和集体智慧，按照着工程师的指挥，“执斧者趋而左，执锯者趋而右”，每一个人一定感想到做这样伟大工程中的一个工人，多么兴奋！可是更深一层想：还会想到这大厦将传给子子孙孙的，那末，几十年、几百年、几千年，一代又一代的子孙们定将寻求到遥远的当初建筑图样在那里，施工细则在那里，他们还将寻求到遥远的当初工程用的斧在那里，锯在那里。
    同志们！作为一个中华人民共和国建国工程中的一个工人，不论站在那种岗位，都应该严肃地提醒自己：你的工作，都将被子子孙孙注视着。所有工作记录，工作用具都将被子子孙孙保存起来。千百年以前的一般文物，尚且被历史家们珍重保护，政府严厉禁止毁坏，而况今天新中国的革命是建成社会主义的社会，尤其是将通过和平的道路，消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，是这样空前伟大的建国规模。
    我们想一想：那一件不是前人从来没有做过的事呢？那一件不是大大地值得纪念的呢？工、矿、农、林、牧、水利、铁道、交通运输、邮电、商业、科学、文化、教育、卫生等一切一切，数是数不尽的，都在逐步地进行社会主义建设、社会主义改造。特别是民族政策的伟大胜利，这般大、这般复杂的中国，这样多的民族已经团结成为一个相亲相爱如兄如弟的大家庭。
    每一种工作多多少少可能还有些问题，什么问题？怎样解决？还不值得郑重记录起来吗？
    新中国成立以来，我们国家在国际事务中的地位愈来愈重要了，我们为世界和平事业作出了举世共知的贡献。中印两国总理联合声明中所提出的互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处五项原则，已被国际间扩大运用，打开了解决国际间某些纠纷的途径，为世界和平事业创造了积极因素。这几年来的国际文件，还不值得珍重地好好保存吗！
    我们必须认识“土改”是一件天大的大事，现在“土改”这个运动已经完成了。在“土改”的基础上已经进一步涌现出农业合作化高潮了，单是加入高级农业生产合作社的农户，已经达到全国农户总数61.1％了。但是“土改”不仅是中国几万万农民的翻身运动，而且具有伟大的国际意义，还不值得纪念吗！
    就把分工负责协助国家团结教育改造工商业者的中国民主建国会来说，它在中国共产党领导下，配合了政府前前后后合情合理的因时因地的种种措施，怎样进行宣传教育，怎样反映意见和情况来解释问题，怎样培养骨干分子，发挥带头、模范和桥梁的作用，一步又一步地踏稳前进，领导上一片苦心，目的是在结合着中国实际情况，把马克思资本论第一卷第二十四章断定着丧钟响了，剥夺者被剥夺了的一般资本家，在我们中国的教育成为中华人民共和国宪法第一章第十条通过利用、限制、鼓励、指导种种方法最后改造做自食其力的劳动公民，这中间种种文告，种种工作记录，事实报道，不值得大大纪念么？
    毫不奇怪，世界上许多国家，特别是社会制度和我们不同的国家，左一个访华团，右一个访华团，一个接一个地越来越多地到中国来要求解答它们疑问，它们老实说，过去是怀疑共产主义的。但事实上确有一个这样的国家在一天一天富强起来，有六亿人民信仰这主义，那必须亲眼看一下，亲耳听一下，它们所最不了解的，那么大的国家，那么多的民族，用什么方法，使得大家快快活活地团结起来？用什么方法，从来没有闹过通货膨胀？特别是用什么方法使资本家欢欣鼓舞地一步一步接受社会主义改造？在社会制度和我们不同的国家的朋友们看来，这些简直是“奇迹”，它们要了解这些方法，就要研究这些文件。
    因此种种，我主张国家必须及时地好好收集和保存这些历史资料，加以整理，中央应该有个总的机构，那当然由科学院全面掌握了。今年4月16日国务院公布关于加强国家档案工作的决定，是很切要的。历史档案之外，应该还有历史资料，——包括历史文件、文物、调查报告、统计资料等——我以为科学院全面掌握以外，应该根据国务院规定：各部、各委员会、各直属机构，各省、各自治区、直辖市人民委员会，各厅、局，各专、县级机关，各级企业单位和人民团体，这些原应该遵照国务院决定分别设立档案室或档案管理处的，就责成这些机关同时负责收集、保存这些历史资料，我相信、我也希望科学院将会制定出办法来。——我主张各级政协、各民主党派应该和各人民团体同样设档案资料室。我还想到各级人民代表大会也应该有同样的设置。——代表同志们每一次发言还不都是非常珍贵的资料吗？
    我们必须认识：如果不好好用这番工夫，这些无比珍贵的历史资料虽然天天在产生，但有一部分天天在散失消灭。
    我们必须认识：这些无比珍贵的历史资料，是无数劳动英雄的汗创造出来的。特别是在这长期革命中间，只有经过一幕又一幕的高度艰苦斗争，才会有这些创造。我们应该以无限悲壮、崇敬、激奋的心情认定这无比珍贵的历史资料中间不少不少是千千万万人民英雄的血。
    我的建议当否？请教。
    很简单地附带报告一些视察北京郊、县农村情况。
    我视察了北京郊区“星火”、通县专区大兴县“芦城”和良乡县“石羊”三个高级农业生产合作社，也和北京市农林水利局长、通县专区专员、通县县长谈过话。——1956，5，28—6，8。
    北京市郊区和通县专区所有合作社已全部高级化了。土地分红完全没有了。入社农户在农户总数中间京郊占99.6％，通县专区占99.52％。
    入社农民收入增加了。今年社都提出了保证，估计夏收分配中，京郊农户和通县专区农户的收入增加情形，大体上都能达到中央的要求。
    农民生产情绪很高，表现在去冬普遍掀起了集体积肥运动，完成了每亩施肥千斤的任务。
    普遍实行了男女同工同酬。“星火”用竞赛方法克服了男工初时看不起女工的思想。
    六十年前永定河泛滥，“芦城”乡成为沙碱地，收入很少很少。现在经过土壤改良，试种水稻，安装了电力抽水机，掀起了劳动高潮。
    一般存在问题是机器供应不足，特别是抽水机。
    我还看过京郊南苑拖拉机站。准备把郊区新运河以南35万亩地耕、耙、播、锄工作全部包下来。存在问题就是机房不够，新到的17架拖拉机放在露天。站提出建屋计划，上级还没有批准，我建议市府急速处理。
    代表同志们！说到保存建国以来的历史资料，更不能不想到这一年来建国工作的成就特别伟大。去年这时候，全中国还只有14％的农户加入合作社，现在加入的农户已达到总农户的90.4％，而这次会议中我们还要通过高级社的示范章程来适应形势的要求了；去年公私合营的企业只是少数的厂店，现在资本主义工商业已全部公私合营了；去年我们所通过的第一个五年计划，这次会议上我们从李先念副总理的预决算报告和其他各部门首长的发言中知道一定可以提前和超额完成了。
    此外，肃反运动的胜利完成，十二年全国农业发展纲要（草案）的公布，十二年科学远景规划的制订，“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”的方针的提出，丰富多采的一九五六年，那一项不使人欢欣鼓舞呢！
    这一年的伟大成就将永远是我国历史上最光辉的一页，也就永远是最宝贵的历史资料。在建国大厦工程中每一个工人都为这种伟大成就而感到自豪。代表同志们！让我们为这大变化、大发展、大胜利的一年而欢呼！为领导中国人民在建设建国大厦工程中获得这样伟大、光辉的成就的中国共产党和毛主席而欢呼！
