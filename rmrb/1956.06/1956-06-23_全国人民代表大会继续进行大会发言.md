Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in his speech, described the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the handling of Japanese war criminals detained in our country.

Luo Ruiqing, Director of the First Office of the State Council and Minister of Public Security, spoke at today's meeting on the current situation in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He said that the results of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries over the past year have further weakened the strength of the remaining counter-revolutionaries, stabilized social order in cities and villages across the country, and further isolated the few resolute counter-revolutionaries. A new situation of further differentiation and disintegration has emerged among the remaining counter-revolutionaries. In his speech, Luo Ruiqing reiterated the state's policy towards counter-revolutionaries: "leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist, commutation of punishment for meritorious service, and rewards for great meritorious service."

The representatives who spoke today also included Liu Ningyi, Deng Yingchao, Lin Tie, Sheng Pihua, Liu Guojun, Qin Renchang, Zhu Shunyu, Huang Rong, and Cheng Shifan.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Luo Ronghuan, Zhang Zhizhong, Lai Ruoyu, Hu Heleta, Xiong Kewu, Lin Qiaozhi, Han Wangchen, Chen Yuan, and Rao Xingli.
