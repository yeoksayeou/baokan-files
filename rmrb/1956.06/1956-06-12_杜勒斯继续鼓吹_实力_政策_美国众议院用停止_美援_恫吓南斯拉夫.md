Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: Dulles delivered a speech at the graduation ceremony of Iowa State University on June 9th, advocating that the United States continue to maintain its huge military expenditure of $40 billion and foreign aid programs.

In his speech, the U.S. Secretary of State vehemently called for support for the U.S. government's foreign aid program. He complained that Congress's reduction of appropriations for this program was inappropriate.

Dulles called the money the United States spends in this area "insurance premiums" for peace. He scared the American people by saying that the United States cannot buy peace and security at a "cheap price," otherwise it will "increase the danger of war."

Dulles used many words to explain that U.S. foreign aid is in line with U.S. interests. He said that the purpose of the United States giving "aid" to foreign countries is to "defeat hostile forces... efforts to expand their power," so that those countries that receive "aid" can "maintain their own armed forces" and can "deal with the conspiracies of international communism."

Dulles said that in the U.S. foreign aid program, "the largest expenditure is in the Pacific and Far East." He specifically mentioned that there are "threats of war" in Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan, and said that "this region is under obvious hostile pressure today." Obviously, Dulles here wanted to stir up hostility towards China.

Although American newspapers on June 9th universally published Bulganin's letter to Eisenhower suggesting disarmament, Dulles did not mention the U.S. attitude towards disarmament in his speech. On the contrary, he emphasized that because the Soviet Union's aid to foreign countries has increased, the United States "needs to continue to implement, and perhaps even expand," its so-called "common security plan" "more than ever before."

According to Xinhua News Agency: Washington, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a proposal on June 8th, believing that the issue of stopping U.S. "aid" to Yugoslavia should be considered. The proposal stipulates that U.S. President Eisenhower should decide whether to stop "aid."

Since the House of Representatives began discussing the "foreign aid" program for the next fiscal year on June 6th, many U.S. congressmen who are accustomed to applying pressure internationally by stopping "aid" have launched attacks on Yugoslavia this time. The recent friendly visit of Yugoslav leaders to the Soviet Union is the reason they believe all "aid" to Yugoslavia should be stopped immediately.

Representative Kelly put forward a proposal stipulating that all "aid" to Yugoslavia should be cancelled.

The leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties in the House of Representatives, who reflect the government's views, advocated amending the proposal, believing that an immediate cancellation was "unwise."

As a result, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to Kelly's proposal by a vote of 123 to 95. The amended proposal stipulates that the President should decide whether to give "aid" to Yugoslavia, and if the President makes a decision to continue "aid," he should be convinced that "the policies of Yugoslavia, which were the basis for providing assistance to Yugoslavia in the past, have not changed," and that continuing to give "aid" is "in the national security interests of the United States."

### 杜勒斯继续鼓吹“实力”政策  美国众议院用停止“美援”恫吓南斯拉夫

    杜勒斯继续鼓吹“实力”政策
    美国众议院用停止“美援”恫吓南斯拉夫
    新华社10日讯　杜勒斯六月九日在依阿华州立大学毕业典礼上发表演说，主张美国继续保持庞大的数达四百亿美元的军事费用和对外援助计划。
    在演说中，这位美国国务卿大声疾呼地要求支持美国政府的援外计划。他抱怨国会削减对这个计划的拨款是不妥当的。
    杜勒斯把美国用在这方面的钱叫做和平的“保险费”。他吓唬美国人民说，美国不能用“便宜的价格”来购买和平和安全，否则就要“增加战争的危险”。
    杜勒斯用了许多话来说明美国的对外援助是符合于美国的利益的。他说，美国给外国以“援助”的目的是为了要“击败敌对势力……为扩张势力而进行的努力”，使那些接受“援助”的国家能够“维持它们自己的武装部队”，能够“对付国际共产主义的阴谋”。
    杜勒斯说，在美国的援外计划中，“最大的开支是在太平洋和远东地区”。他特别提到了朝鲜、越南和台湾存在着“战争的威胁”，并且说“这个地区今天处于明显的敌意的压力之下”。显然，杜勒斯在这里是想煽起对中国的敌对情绪。
    虽然六月九日的美国报纸普遍刊载了布尔加宁向艾森豪威尔建议实行裁军的信件。但是，杜勒斯在演说里一点也没有提到美国对裁军的态度，他反而强调说，因为苏联对外国的援助增加了，美国“比过去任何时候都更加需要继续执行也许还要扩大”美国的所谓“共同安全计划”。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国众议院六月八日通过了一个提案，认为应该考虑停止给予南斯拉夫以美国“援助”的问题，提案规定由美国总统艾森豪威尔来决定是否停止“援助”。
    从众议院在六月六日开始讨论下一财政年度“援外”计划以后，惯于在国际上用停止“援助”来施加压力的许多美国议员，这次纷纷对南斯拉夫展开攻击。南斯拉夫领导人最近在苏联进行的友好访问是他们认为应当立即停止给南斯拉夫的全部“援助”的理由。
    众议员凯利提出了一项提案，其中规定取消给予南斯拉夫的全部“援助”。
    反映政府意见的众议院共和、民主两党领袖主张对这个提案加以修改，他们认为立即取消的做法是“不明智的”。
    结果，众议院以一百二十三票对九十五票通过了对凯利提案的修正。修正后的提案规定，由总统来决定是否给予南斯拉夫“援助”问题，而总统如果作出继续“援助”的决定，就应该确信“作为在过去向南斯拉夫提供援助的根据的南斯拉夫的政策没有改变”，确信继续给予“援助”是“符合美国的国家安全利益的”。
