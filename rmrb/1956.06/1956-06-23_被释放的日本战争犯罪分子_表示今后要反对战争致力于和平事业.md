Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The 335 Japanese war criminals who were exempted from prosecution and immediately released by the Supreme People's Procuratorate on the 21st unanimously expressed their gratitude for the leniency of the Chinese government. Many confessed their past crimes at the meeting announcing the exemption from prosecution and expressed their determination to contribute to opposing war, maintaining peace, and promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.

In Fushun, after the 295 Japanese war criminals were leniently released at the meeting announcing their exemption from prosecution, all of them raised their hands to request to speak. Yoshida Kazumori, the former police chief of Muling County, Mudanjiang Province, Manchukuo, who had driven thousands of peaceful Chinese residents to work in coal mines, stepped onto the stage first. He said with tears in his eyes: "I am a person who has committed serious crimes. Today, I have received such lenient treatment, which makes me feel grateful as never before in my life. Now the Chinese people are allowing me to be a new person and correct my past mistakes. I am determined not to follow the path of crime in the past and to contribute my remaining life to Sino-Japanese friendship and the prosperity of my motherland."

Kataoka Kazunobu, former Deputy Director of the Dalian Pier Bureau of the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd. and Director of the Maintenance Room, then spoke. He said: "The crimes I committed against the Chinese people in the past are indelible facts in history. In the past few years, I have received humane treatment and meticulous care from the Chinese people, and today I have been granted exemption from prosecution and lenient release. This fact not only makes me ashamed but also gives me strength. I must contribute my strength to opposing wars of aggression, defending peace, and promoting Sino-Japanese friendship in the future."

Nakamura Goro, Takahashi Shozo, Miyazaki Toshio, and Watanabe Shinichi also spoke successively. They all recounted the crimes they committed in China, expressed their gratitude for the lenient treatment they received, and said that they would never forget the humane treatment they received from the Chinese people.

In Taiyuan, many of the Japanese war criminals who were exempted from prosecution and leniently released accepted the exemption from prosecution decisions issued by the procurators with tears in their eyes. At the meeting announcing the exemption from prosecution, they all raised their hands at the same time, vying to shout "I want to speak." The first to speak on stage was Sawaguchi Yoshiaki, who was elected by them as their representative. Sawaguchi Yoshiaki said: "We accept the grace of the lenient treatment bestowed upon us with heartfelt gratitude. This lenient measure of the Chinese government is something I will never forget in my life." At this time, the entire audience unanimously shouted "We feel the same!" in Japanese.

Sawaguchi Yoshiaki said: "After Japan surrendered, we just took off the blood-stained Japanese military uniforms and put on the military uniforms of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, dreaming that Japanese militarism would make a comeback." He stated that after returning to his country, he must strive to "restore the Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations that were severed due to the war of aggression in which we directly participated."

At the end of his speech, Sawaguchi Yoshiaki suggested observing a moment of silence for the Chinese martyrs to express heartfelt apologies. At this time, everyone in the audience stood up and bowed their heads in silence.

Teramoto Hidenori, a former Japanese army private and a major company deputy in Yan's bandit army, spoke on the stage. When he talked about the humane treatment he received during his detention and contrasted it with his past crimes, he was choked with sobs. Teramoto Hidenori finally said: "I want to swear to the families of the Chinese people who were killed by me that, no matter when or where, I will admit the crimes I committed in the past and expose the brutal nature of imperialism to the people of the world through my own crimes."

    被释放的日本战争犯罪分子
    表示今后要反对战争致力于和平事业
    新华社22日讯　最高人民检察院在二十一日宣布免予起诉立即释放的335名日本战争犯罪分子，对中国政府的宽大处理一致表示感激。许多人在宣布免予起诉决定的大会上忏悔了过去，并表示决心要为反对战争、维护和平和促进中日友好关系而贡献力量。
    在抚顺，295名日本战争犯罪分子在宣布免予起诉的大会上得到宽释以后，全体一齐举手要求发言。曾驱使成千名中国和平居民到煤矿底下做苦工的前伪满牡丹江省穆棱县警正吉田一盛首先站到台上讲话。他感动得流着泪说：“我是个犯有重大罪恶的人，今天受到这样宽大的处理，使我感到出生以来从没有过的感激。现在中国人民让我重新做人，痛改前非，我决心今后不再走过去罪恶的道路，要为中日友好和祖国的富强贡献出后半生。”
    前日本南满洲铁路株式会社大连埠头局副局长兼整备室主任片冈一信接着讲话。他说：“我过去对中国人民所犯的罪恶是历史上不可磨灭的事实。几年来我受到中国人民的人道待遇和无微不至的关照，今天又得到免予起诉宽大释放的处理，这个事实不仅使我惭愧，也给了我力量。我今后一定要为反对侵略战争，保卫和平，为中日友好贡献出我的力量。”
    中村五郎、高桥正三、宫崎敏夫和渡部信一也相继讲话，他们都陈诉了自己在中国犯下的罪恶，对受到的宽大处理表示万分感激，并且表示永远忘不了中国人民对他们的人道待遇。
    在太原，被免予起诉宽大释放的日本战争犯罪分子中，有许多人流着泪接受了检察员发给他们的免予起诉决定书。在宣布免予起诉的大会上，他们都同时举起手来争先恐后地喊着“我要发言”。首先上台讲话的是他们自己推选出来的代表泽口良明。泽口良明说：“我们谨以充满内心的感激接受赐予我们的宽大处理的恩典，中国政府对我们的这种宽大措施，是我一生永远不能忘记的。”这时候，全场一致用日本话高呼“同感！”
    泽口良明说：“日本投降后，我们刚脱下沾满血迹的日本军服，就又换上了蒋介石、阎锡山的军装，梦想着日本军国主义卷土重来。”他表示，他回国后一定要努力把“由于我们直接参加的侵略战争而断绝了的中日邦交恢复起来”。
    泽口良明在讲话的最后建议向中国先烈默哀，以表示衷心谢罪。这时候，全场的人站立起来，低下头默哀。
    前日本陆军上等兵、阎匪军少校大队副寺本秀则在台上讲了话。当他谈到他在管押期间所受到的人道待遇并和他过去的罪行相对比的时候，他哭不成声。寺本秀则最后说：“我要向那些被我杀害的中国人民的家属宣誓，今后在无论什么时间，什么地方，我都要承认我过去犯下的罪行，通过自己的罪行向全世界人民揭露帝国主义的残暴本质。”
