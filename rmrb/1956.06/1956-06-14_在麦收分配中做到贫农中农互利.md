Achieving Mutual Benefit for Poor and Middle Peasants in Wheat Distribution
Liu Zhen, Li Huzhen

Like other regions across the country, Wuxiang County in Shanxi Province has had a bumper wheat harvest. With the wheat harvest, a critical issue has emerged in the agricultural production cooperatives: Should this year's wheat be distributed on a "whoever sows, reaps" basis, or should it be distributed uniformly?

The Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township is the pilot cooperative for wheat distribution by the Wuxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The members have been arguing endlessly about this issue.

The cooperative planted a total of 2,404 mu of wheat, with an estimated yield of 162 jin per mu this year, an increase of twenty-seven jin over last year. This wheat originally belonged to five primary cooperatives—Chengguan, Dongcun, Shangcheng, Xiacheng, and Huzhuangpu—and 138 new members. Because the wheat seedlings in each cooperative and household were of varying quality, everyone had different opinions on distribution. The Chengguan cooperative applied more fertilizer, and the wheat grew well. Members originally from the Chengguan cooperative advocated for separate distribution. The Shangcheng and Huzhuangpu cooperatives used less fertilizer and labor, and the land was steep, so their wheat was inferior to that of Chengguan. Members from these two places advocated for unified distribution. The wheat in the Dongcun and Xiacheng cooperatives was neither good nor bad, and members originally from these two cooperatives thought "any distribution method would do." Among the one hundred-plus new members, the old middle peasants with more and better wheat fields firmly advocated "whoever sows, reaps," while the poor peasant members without wheat fields or with poor wheat seedlings urgently demanded unified distribution. Poor peasant Wu Dou-si said: Since joining the cooperative, I have actively engaged in production, getting up before dawn and going to bed late, weeding the wheat for ten days, collecting over a hundred dan of manure, and applying topdressing. Yet, you want "whoever sows, reaps," not letting me eat a single grain of wheat. I might as well leave the cooperative and take a few days off. Middle peasant Wu Zuo-yin calculated: If we distribute on a "whoever sows, reaps" basis, my three mu of wheat can yield two shi and seven dou, enough for each of my family of four to eat almost seven dou. If we distribute uniformly through the cooperative, I will have worked fifty labor days, and after deducting investment, I will only receive a little over one shi. He firmly demanded "whoever sows, reaps" and even devised a clever plan: If a unified distribution is decided upon, report forty dan of fertilizer applied per mu as sixty-five dan, and four labor days per mu as six labor days, making sure not to lose out.

These opinions were reflected in the cooperative's management committee. Wu Gui-yuan, a staff member originally from the Chengguan cooperative, said that last year's wheat was harvested separately, so this year it should also be harvested separately, otherwise it would violate the principle of "whoever sows, reaps." Yan Quan-cheng, a staff member originally from the Shangcheng cooperative, said that "whoever sows, reaps" violates the cooperative's charter on "seedlings entering the cooperative" and the spirit of the "Five Guarantees." More than twenty households of widowed and childless new members without labor power in the cooperative would not be able to eat wheat. At the members' representative meeting, everyone still had their own reasons. Villages and villages, new members and old members, poor peasant members and middle peasant members argued endlessly, blaming each other. Poor peasant Wu Dou-si simply stopped working in the cooperative and spent his days processing crops on his private plot. This issue directly affected the consolidation of the agricultural cooperative.

Originally, when the cooperatives merged and upgraded, they had already adopted the charter and agreed to the unified distribution of wheat fields. But now problems have arisen. What are the reasons? After specific analysis, there are three reasons: First, those who advocate "whoever sows, reaps" did not expect the wheat seedlings to grow so well this year before the merger. Now that they see the wheat is good, their thinking is fluctuating. Second, the cooperative did not calculate the seeds, fertilizer, labor, and animal power invested by the members at the time of sowing reasonably enough. Third, no members had participated in the distribution of a large cooperative, and the new members were even less aware of how to distribute, fearing that the distribution would be inappropriate and they would suffer losses.

In response to these reasons, the cooperative's Party branch first promoted the management committee to immediately, in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit, sort out the seeds, fertilizer, human and animal labor invested by the members in planting wheat; all those that were originally calculated unreasonably were readjusted reasonably. Then it carried out ideological education for the members. The main method was to specifically analyze the reasons why wheat grew well. Member Wu Ying-gao (new middle peasant) had a wheat field that was cultivated once by the cooperative and fertilized with ten dan of topdressing, yielding 150 jin per mu. Another wheat field had the same soil quality and labor costs, but without cultivation and fertilization, it only yielded 120 jin. This made the middle peasant members realize that the higher yield in their fields was the result of the cooperative's cultivation and fertilization. After education, Wu Ying-gao said: "If I hadn't joined the cooperative, I would definitely not have had the strength to cultivate and fertilize. Cooperation between poor and middle peasants is strength. Now I understand."

Through the above aspects of work, the members' ideological understanding has been improved, and they all said that this year's wheat should still be distributed uniformly within the cooperative; because unified distribution has the following benefits: (1) It facilitates the expansion of socialist public accumulation. The new members' wheat fields can produce a total of 41,400 jin of wheat. Implementing unified distribution can increase the cooperative's public welfare fund and accumulation fund by 3,312 jin. (2) Labor power can still be unifiedly directed during the summer harvest, which facilitates the promotion of labor quotas and ensures the timely completion of production plans. (3) It is convenient to calculate, saving trouble after autumn. (4) It facilitates deducting investments for the second half of the year and accumulating cattle grass. (5) It can demonstrate the superiority of agricultural cooperatives of a completely socialist nature - new members who have not planted wheat can eat wheat as long as they have worked labor days, and widowed, orphaned, and childless households without labor power can also eat white flour because the cooperative implements the "Five Guarantees."

With the members' thinking unified, the cooperative formulated a preliminary wheat distribution plan. After deducting agricultural tax, production investment, and accumulation fund from the total wheat income of the cooperative, the remaining 70% is distributed to the members. According to the plan, each member's wheat income is more than last year. The entire cooperative of 2,180 people can get an average of 101 jin of wheat per person, an increase of more than twenty-six jin over last year. Wu Lai-lie and other twenty-nine poor and laborless households who did not plant wheat were also given wheat. Two hundred and fifty households received an average of 150 jin more wheat than last year.

    在麦收分配中做到贫农中农互利
    留珍　李虎珍
    和全国其他地区一样，山西省武乡县的小麦丰收了。随着麦子丰收，农业生产合作社出现了一个尖锐的问题：今年的麦子究竟是“谁种谁收”呢？还是统一分配呢？
    城关乡五星农业合作社是中共武乡县委进行小麦分配的试点社。社员们曾经为了这个问题争论不休。
    这个社共种小麦2，404亩，预计今年每亩可产162斤，比去年增产二十七斤。这些小麦原来属于城关、东村、上城、下城、胡庄铺五个初级社和138户新社员。因为各社各户麦苗好坏不一样，大家对于分配便各有各的意见。城关社的麦子施肥多，麦子长的好，原来属于城关社的社员主张各分各的；上城、胡庄铺的麦子施肥、用工少，土地又是陡坡地，麦子次于城关，这两处的社员主张统一分。东村、下城两社的麦子不好不坏，原属这两社的社员认为“怎么分都行”。一百多户新社员当中，麦田既多又好的老中农坚决主张“谁种谁收”，没有麦田和麦苗不好的贫农社员迫切要求统一分配。贫农武豆四说：我入社以来积极生产，起五更睡半夜，锄了十天小麦，拾了一百多担粪，施了追肥，你们却要“谁种谁收”，不让我吃一粒麦，我还不如出社消闲几天好。中农社员武作寅算了一笔账，说：如果自种自收，我三亩麦可收二石七，全家四口人每人差不多能吃七斗；要是归社统一分，我做了五十个劳动日，除了投资，只能分一石多。他坚决要求“谁种谁收”，而且还想了个妙计：如果决定统一分配，就把每亩施四十担肥报为六十五担，每亩用四个工报为六个工，反正不能让自己吃了亏。
    这些意见，反映到了社管理委员会上。原属城关社的工作人员武贵员说去年麦子是各自种的，应该各自收，否则就违背了“谁种谁收”的原则。原属上城社的工作人员阎全成说：“谁种谁收”违背了社章“青苗入社”的规定和“五保”的精神，全社有二十多户鳏寡无劳力的新社员将吃不到小麦。在社员代表会上，还是各说各有理。村和村、新社员和老社员、贫农社员和中农社员一直争论不休，互相埋怨。贫农武豆四干脆不到社内劳动，整日在自留地里加工。这个问题，直接影响到农业合作社的巩固。
    本来，各社在合并升级的时候，已经通过制定社章，同意麦田统一分配。但是现在又出了问题，究竟是什么原因呢？经具体分析，原因有三个：第一、主张“谁种谁收”的人，在并社前，没想到今年麦苗长的这么好。现在看到麦子好了，思想波动起来。第二、合作社把下种时候社员投下的种籽、肥料，用的劳、畜力计算得不够合理。第三、所有社员都没有参加过大社分配，新社员更不了解怎样分配，怕分的不合适，自己吃了亏。
    合作社的党支部针对这些原因，首先推动管理委员会本着互利原则，立即清理社员种麦投入的种籽、肥料和人畜工；原来计算得不合理的，都重新调整合理了。接着就对社员进行思想教育。主要办法是具体分析小麦长得好的原因。社员武应高（新中农）有一块麦田，社里加工锄了一次，施追肥十担，每亩可产一百五十斤。另有一块麦田，地质、工本费都一样，就是没有加工、加肥，结果只能产一百二十斤。这就使中农社员认识到自己地里多产麦是社里加工加肥的结果。经过教育，武应高说：“如果我不入社，绝对没力量去加工加肥，贫中农合作就是力量，这下我可认识了。”
    通过以上几方面的工作，社员的思想认识提高了，都说今年小麦还是社内统一分配好；因为统一分配有如下好处：（一）便于扩大社会主义公共积累。新社员麦田共可产麦四万一千四百斤，实行统一分配，就可给社内增加公益金和公积金3，312斤。（二）夏收中劳力仍可统一指挥，便于推广劳动定额，保证生产计划按期完成。
  （三）计算方便，省得秋后麻烦。
  （四）便于扣除下半年投资，积蓄下牛草。（五）能显示出完全社会主义性质的农业合作社的优越性——没有种麦的新社员，只要做了劳动日就能吃到小麦，鳏寡孤独无劳力户由于合作社实行“五保”，也可以吃到白面。
    社员思想认识统一了，合作社制定了小麦预分方案。全社小麦总收入扣除农业税、生产投资和公积金公益金以后，下剩70％分给社员。按照方案分，每户社员的小麦收入都比去年多。全社2，180口人，每人平均可得麦子101斤，比去年增加了二十六斤多。武来烈等二十九户未种小麦的贫困无劳力户也分到了小麦。有二百五十户平均比去年多分麦一百五十斤以上。
