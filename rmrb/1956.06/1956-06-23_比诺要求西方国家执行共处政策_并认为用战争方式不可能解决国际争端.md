Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 21st: French Foreign Minister Pineau stated yesterday in a speech at the National Press Club in the United States that peaceful coexistence between different political, economic, and ideological systems is necessary, and Western countries cannot refuse to move towards East-West cooperation.

He believes that maintaining the international stalemate's "only possible result is to maintain distrust, misfortune, and poverty in the world," and that implementing a policy of peaceful coexistence "can enable us to strive to jump out of the predicament we are in now."

Pineau said that France's foreign policy has two aspects: continuing to be loyal to "the alliance and our current collective security system," while also advocating "re-establishing contact with Eastern countries." He said: Some people in the United States feel that this approach is contradictory, but it is not contradictory because France truly believes that "international disputes cannot be resolved by war."

Pineau called on Western countries to take a step in the direction of economic and cultural cooperation that the Soviet Union hopes for, and on this basis, to substantially increase the exchange of people. He said: "We often criticize the Soviets for maintaining the Iron Curtain. Therefore, we on our side must not now try to build an Iron Curtain between the two parts of the world." He believes that the West can use this kind of exchange to infiltrate the West's "most fundamental ideas" into socialist countries.

After finishing his speech, Pineau, in answering questions from reporters, expressed his disagreement with the wording in the Dulles-Adenauer communiqué regarding the issue of German reunification. He said: To say that nothing can be done before the German reunification issue is resolved "exaggerates" the importance of German reunification.

    比诺要求西方国家执行共处政策
    并认为用战争方式不可能解决国际争端
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：法国外交部长比诺昨天在美国全国新闻俱乐部发表演讲说：不同的政治、经济和思想体系之间的和平共处是必要的，西方国家不能够拒绝走向东西方合作。
    他认为保持国际僵持局面的“唯一可能的结果是在世界上保持不信任、不幸和贫乏”，而执行共处政策“能够使我们努力来跳出现在所处的困境”。
    比诺说，法国的外交政策有两个方面：继续忠于“联盟和我们目前的集体安全体系”，同时又主张“同东方国家恢复接触”。他说：美国有一部分人觉得这样做法有矛盾，不过，这是不矛盾的，因为法国真正相信“用战争的方式不可能解决国际争端”。
    比诺要求西方国家向苏联希望的经济和文化合作的方向迈进一步，在这个基础上将相当大规模地增加人与人之间的来往。他说：“我们经常批评苏联人保持铁幕，因此，我们方面现在也不能设法在世界的两个部分之间建立一道铁幕。”他认为西方可以通过这种交流把西方“最基本的思想”渗入社会主义阵营国家。
    比诺在结束讲演后回答记者们的问题时表示，他不同意杜勒斯—阿登纳会谈公报中关于德国重新统一问题的提法。他说：要说在解决德国统一问题以前不能做任何事情，那“未免夸大了”德国重新统一问题的重要性。
