Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: Vigorously excavate and organize traditional operas, expand and enrich the repertoire, and propel opera art to new prosperity. This was proposed at the National Opera Repertoire Work Conference held in Beijing from June 1st to 15th.
    Opera repertoire workers and opera performers from various regions focused on discussing the main issues in the current repertoire work as reported by Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, at the meeting. They believed that the fundamental reasons for the lack, monotony, and low quality of the performed repertoire were the influence of many rigid rules and restrictions in the repertoire work. Participants summarized the following experience from the achievements made in recent years of opera work in implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new": the excavation and organization of the repertoire should be based on the characteristics of each opera genre to give play to its strengths. To give each genre a new life, it must be based on its original foundation and promote its development according to its own development trend. Each genre should enrich itself by absorbing the excellent repertoire of brother genres on the basis of giving play to the unique artistic style of its own genre. The organization, adaptation, and creation of opera repertoires must rely on opera performers.
    The conference also explored the standards for the organization and adaptation of opera repertoires. Zhang Geng, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Opera, gave a special report on this issue and specifically discussed six operas with more controversy, such as "Ningwu Pass" and "Si Lang Visits His Mother." The conference believed that any repertoire that can play an active educational role, inspire people's spirits, or give people aesthetic enjoyment and pleasure should be affirmed. Otherwise, it should be opposed.
    Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China, made important reports on the excavation, organization, and adaptation of opera repertoires during the conference.

    大力发掘整理传统剧目，扩大和丰富上演剧目
    把戏曲艺术推向新的繁荣
    据新华社15日讯　大力发掘、整理传统剧目，扩大和丰富上演剧目，把戏曲艺术推向新的繁荣。这是从六月一日到十五日在北京举行的全国戏曲剧目工作会议提出来的。
    各地戏曲剧目工作者和戏曲艺人着重讨论了文化部副部长刘芝明在会上报告的关于目前剧目工作中的主要问题，认为上演剧目贫乏、单调、质量不高的基本原因，是在剧目工作中受了许多清规戒律的影响。参加会议的人员从近几年来的戏曲工作贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针上所取得的成绩中，总结出这样的经验：在发掘、整理剧目中应根据各个剧种的特点发挥其特长。要使每一剧种获得新的生命，必须在它原有的基础上，按照它自己的发展趋向来促进其发展。每个剧种要在发挥本剧种的独特艺术风格的基础上，吸收兄弟剧种的优秀剧目来丰富自己。对戏曲剧目的整理、改编和创作，必须依靠戏曲艺人来进行。
    这次会议还探讨了戏曲剧目整理、改编的标准问题。中国戏曲研究院副院长张庚对这个问题作了专题报告。并选择争论较多的“宁武关”、“四郎探母”等六出戏进行了具体讨论。会议认为，凡是能起积极教育作用，能鼓舞人们精神向上，或能给人以美感上的享受和愉快的剧目，都应加以肯定。否则，就应该反对。
    中共中央宣传部副部长周扬和中华人民共和国文化部副部长钱俊瑞在会议期间分别就戏曲剧目的发掘、整理和改编问题作了重要的报告。
