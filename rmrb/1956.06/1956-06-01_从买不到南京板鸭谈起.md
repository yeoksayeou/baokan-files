Starting from the Difficulty of Buying Nanjing Salted Duck
By Our Correspondent Zhen Weimin

Nanjing salted duck, a specialty famous throughout the country, has become increasingly scarce in the market in the past two years. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, Nanjing markets couldn't buy salted duck at all. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is the peak season for the production and sale of salted duck, the state-owned Jiangsu Provincial Food Company only supplied Nanjing for two days before selling out again. From mid-November of last year to mid-February of this year (Spring Festival), the state-owned company supplied more salted duck to the Nanjing market. However, food companies in Beijing, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Zhangjiakou, Zhengzhou, and other provinces and cities telegraphed or wrote to the Jiangsu Provincial Food Company, requesting them to supply a portion of salted duck, but they didn't receive a single one. After February of this year, the supply of salted duck in the Nanjing market became even more erratic, with many joint state-private salted duck shops only selling marinated dishes and no salted duck. Many chefs skilled in making salted duck are afraid that their skills will also become "unique secrets."

The increasing scarcity of Nanjing salted duck is inseparable from the declining purchase volume of live ducks in Jiangsu Province. In 1951 and 1952, nearly one million ducks were sold on the Nanjing market each year. In 1954, this figure dropped to 400,000, and in 1955, it was less than 200,000. The state-owned food company's acquisition of ducks in the province's rural areas is also unsatisfactory. In 1954, the Jiangsu Provincial Food Company purchased live ducks equal only to the normal annual purchase volume of Nanjing city in the past. In 1955, the state-owned company strengthened its acquisition work in rural areas, but the result was still a 13% decrease compared to 1954. Adding the decrease in the amount sold on the Nanjing market, the province's total purchase volume of live ducks decreased by more than 50%. Typical surveys in the famous duck-raising area of Lixiahe show that many agricultural cooperatives raise about 90% fewer ducks than in the past. Liu Lu Township in Xinghua County used to raise three to four thousand ducks, but this year it only raised 292. Zhang Shi Township in Baoying County used to raise five to six thousand ducks, but this year it only raised 540. Old duck farmers in this township, such as Xu Guangbao, Xu Chaoyang, and Xu Zhaonan, used to raise 800 ducks per household each year, but now they don't raise any.

Many areas in Jiangsu Province, such as Taihu Lake, Lixiahe, and along the Yangtze River, are densely covered with paddy fields and crisscrossed by rivers and canals. Farmers have a tradition of raising ducks. There are many benefits to raising ducks. Farmers with duck-raising skills can raise three to five hundred ducks per person. Every hundred ducks can produce 13.5 dan of duck eggs per year. The manure from every seven ducks can fertilize one mu of paddy field. If managed well, ducks can also help farmers eliminate pests in the fields without damaging crops. When the ducks are raised to a certain stage, farmers drive flocks of ducks to the city to sell, earning a considerable sideline income from duck raising. The live ducks and egg products purchased by state purchasing agencies not only meet the needs of the people in the province but can also be made into frozen ducks and sold in large quantities to foreign countries (feathers can also be exported) to exchange for materials needed for national construction.

Since there are so many benefits to raising ducks, why have the number of ducks in Jiangsu Province decreased so much in the past two years? Objectively, there may be many reasons, such as insufficient production funds for farmers after the 1954 flood, lack of capital to raise ducks, etc. However, the most important reason is that some leading organs in duck-raising areas have an insufficient understanding of the comprehensive development of production. They only focus on leading agricultural production and neglect leading sideline production. They rarely care about the duck-raising situation in these areas and have not solved many specific problems in duck raising.

In 1954, most areas in the province emphasized cultivating ratooning rice and did not allow farmers to release ducks into the fields. There was even a tendency to force farmers to sell and kill ducks. The Party branch secretary of Zhang Shi Township in Baoying County held a meeting of duck farmers, forcing them to sell their ducks. Farmers who did not agree were not allowed to go home. The farmers in this township still do not know whether the government allows duck raising until recently. In 1955, the emphasis was on changing to late rice. After the late rice harvest, wheat was immediately planted, and ducks could not be put into the harvested rice fields, which reduced the amount of natural feed. Bran is a supplementary feed for ducks, but most of the bran is supplied to pig raising and other production. Without feed, ducks are naturally raised less.

Last winter and this spring, a large number of duck farmers joined agricultural production cooperatives. They were not clear about specific policies such as whether the ducks they raised should be managed uniformly by the cooperative, whether they should be valued and what the labor compensation would be, whether individuals were allowed to raise ducks, and how duck manure should be handled. Therefore, they did not dare to raise ducks. Liu Donghui, a member of the Liu Lu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baoying County, had raised ducks for more than 30 years. Before joining the cooperative, he sold all of his 400 ducks because he was unclear about the policy. After joining the cooperative, he did not raise them again. Some cooperatives also wrongly stipulated that chickens and ducks should be raised uniformly by the cooperative, but because the daily wage base price predetermined in the cooperative for agricultural labor was too high, members were busy competing for work points in agricultural production and did not have the manpower to manage this sideline. As a result, there was no joint raising in the cooperative, and the masses did not individually engage in this household sideline either.

Recently, some cooperatives have begun to pay attention to the sideline production of duck raising, but due to poor feeding and lack of technical guidance, a large number of ducks have died. Some hatcheries that incubate ducklings have a purely profit-oriented view, selling the ducklings that have just hatched to the cooperative. Most of these ducklings cannot survive. These reasons have reduced the confidence of cooperatives in developing duck-raising production.

In fact, as long as the leadership attaches importance to the development of this sideline production, strengthens leadership, and helps farmers solve technical and feed problems in the feeding process, the duck-raising sideline will soon be redeveloped. In the production of 1954, Xiji Agricultural Cooperative of Yancheng County, discovered that some surplus labor force did not play a role, so they sent a deputy director to specialize in leading them to carry out sideline production, and duck raising was one of the important sidelines in the cooperative. The whole cooperative raised more than 1,500 ducks and implemented a duck raising system that included contracting labor, feed, output, and mortality rate. According to statistics in 1955, the income from this sideline alone accounted for more than one-tenth of the total annual agricultural income of the cooperative. Wei Yongkuan, a member of this cooperative who specializes in duck raising, is very experienced in duck raising. He is responsible for raising 350 ducks and has overfulfilled the requirements of contracting labor, output, and mortality rate. He also produced more than five dan of duck eggs more than required in a year. Because of his great achievements in duck raising, he received an overproduction award from the cooperative and was named a second-class model.

Now is a good time to hatch ducklings in large quantities and develop duck-raising production. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Yangzhou and other local Party committees are earnestly leading farmers to carry out this production. The Provincial People's Committee has also specifically arranged the duck-raising tasks for various places, and instructed relevant departments to help farmers solve problems such as funds and feed for duck raising. It is expected that duck-raising production in Jiangsu Province will have a great development this year.

    从买不到南京板鸭谈起
    本报记者　甄为民
    驰名全国的南京特产——板鸭，近两年来在市场上愈来愈少了。去年中秋节前，南京市场上根本买不到板鸭。中秋节后是板鸭的产销旺季，国营江苏省食品公司在南京只供应了两天，以后又脱销了。从去年十一月中旬到今年二月中旬（春节），国营公司虽然供应南京市场的板鸭比较多了，可是，北京、天津、黑龙江、吉林、张家口、郑州等省市的食品公司先后打电报或写信给江苏省食品公司，要求供应他们一部分板鸭，但一只也没有给。今年二月以后，南京市场上的板鸭供应更不正常，许多公私合营板鸭店里只有卤菜而没有板鸭。许多擅长做板鸭的厨师都在害怕他们的技术也要变成“绝技”了。
    南京板鸭愈来愈少，是和江苏省的活鸭收购量日益减少分不开的。1951年和1952年南京市场上鸭子的上市量每年都将近一百万只，1954年下降到四十万只，1955年竟不到二十万只了。国营食品公司在全省农村中收购鸭子的情况也不能令人满意。1954年江苏省食品公司在全省收购到的活鸭只等于过去南京一个城市的常年收购量。1955年国营公司加强了在农村中的收购工作，结果收购数还是比1954年下降了13％，加上南京市场上市量的减少，全省活鸭收购量下降了50％以上。著名的养鸭地区——里下河地区的一些典型调查都说明：许多农业合作社的养鸭数字都比过去少了90％左右。兴化县的刘陆乡过去养三、四千只鸭子，今年只养了292只；宝应县章士乡过去养鸭五、六千只，今年只养了540多只。这个乡的老养鸭户徐广宝、徐朝阳、徐兆南等，过去每户每年要养八百只鸭，现在都不养了。
    江苏省的太湖、里下河和沿江的许多地区，水田密布，河网交错，农民都有养鸭的习惯。养鸭的好处很多，有养鸭技术的农民一人可以养三、五百只鸭子，每百只鸭子一年可以产十三担半鸭蛋，每七只鸭子的鸭粪，可以上一亩水稻田，管理得好，鸭子还可以帮助农民消灭农田里的害虫，而不会损坏庄稼。鸭子养到一定的时候，农民就把成趟的鸭群，赶到城市出售，可以从养鸭得到一笔很可观的副业收入。国家收购机关收购来的活鸭和蛋品，不仅供应本省人民的需要，还能制成冻鸭，大量销到外国去（羽毛也可以外销），以换取国家建设中所需要的物资。
    养鸭既然有这许多好处，为什么江苏省的鸭子这两年来大大减少了呢？客观上也许会有很多原因，例如1954年大水后，农民生产资金不足，没有本钱养鸭等。但是，最主要的原因还是：养鸭地区的某些领导机关对全面发展生产的认识不足，只偏重于农业生产的领导，忽视了副业生产的领导，很少关心这些地区养鸭的情况，没有解决养鸭中的许多具体问题。
    1954年全省多数地区强调培育再生稻，不许农民放鸭下田，甚至发生强迫农民卖鸭和杀鸭的偏向。宝应县章士乡党支部书记召开养鸭户会议，强迫农民卖鸭，思想不通的农民不准回家，这个乡的农民直到最近还不知道政府准不准养鸭。而在1955年则强调改种晚稻，晚稻收割后紧接着又要种麦，鸭子不能放入收割后的稻田，就减少了大量的天然饲料。糠麸是鸭子的辅助饲料，可是糠麸绝大部分又供应了养猪和其他生产，鸭子没有饲料，自然养得少了。
    去冬今春，大批养鸭农民加入了农业生产合作社，他们对自己养的鸭子要不要归社统一经营，折不折价、劳动报酬高不高、许不许个人养鸭、鸭粪如何处理等具体政策都不够清楚，因而不敢养鸭。宝应县刘陆农业生产合作社社员刘东辉，养了三十多年的鸭子，入社前因为不明政策，把自家的四百多只鸭全部卖掉了，入社以后也没有再养。有些合作社还错误地规定：鸡、鸭一律由社统一公养，但是因为社内预定的农业劳动日报酬基价太高，社员忙于在农业生产上争工分，就没有人力经营这项副业，结果社内根本没有合养，群众也不个别经营这项家庭副业了。
    最近有一些合作社虽然已经重视了养鸭的副业生产，但是因为饲养不善，技术指导差，造成了大批鸭子死亡的现象。有些孵育小鸭的炕坊有单纯营利观点，把刚出蛋壳的小鸭，就卖给社里，这样的小鸭大部分都不能成活。这些原因都降低了合作社发展养鸭生产的信心。
    事实上，只要领导上重视这一项副业生产的发展，加强领导，帮助农民解决饲养过程中的技术、饲料等问题，养鸭副业很快就会重新发展起来。盐城县西季农业合作社，在1954年的生产中，发现有一些剩余劳动力没有发挥作用，就派了一个副社长专门领导他们开展副业生产，养鸭是社内重要的副业之一。全社共养鸭一千五百多只，实行了包工、包饲料、包产量、包死亡率的养鸭制度，据1955年统计，仅这一项副业收入就占到全社全年农业收入的十分之一以上。这个社里有一个专门养鸭的社员韦永宽，养鸭很有经验，他负责养的三百五十只鸭子，超额完成了包工、包产、包死亡率的要求，一年内还超过规定多生了五担多鸭蛋。由于他养鸭很有成绩，得到社内的超产奖励，被评为二等模范。
    现在正是大量孵化小鸭发展养鸭生产的好时候，中共江苏省委和扬州等地党委都正在切实地领导农民开展这种生产，省人民委员会也具体布置了各地养鸭的任务，并且指令有关部门帮助农民解决养鸭的资金、饲料等问题。预计今年江苏省的养鸭生产将会有很大发展。
