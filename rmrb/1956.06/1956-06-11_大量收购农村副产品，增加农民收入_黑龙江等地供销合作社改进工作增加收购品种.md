Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th: As of the end of May, the supply and marketing cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province have already purchased rural sideline products worth more than 24 million yuan, an increase of 119% compared to the same period last year.

　　In the work of purchasing native and sideline products, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have universally promoted the advanced experience of the Gongsheng Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huachuan County, which helps agricultural cooperatives make plans for sideline production. They actively find sideline production resources for agricultural cooperatives, calculate sideline income accounts for members, encourage members to actively participate in sideline production of agricultural cooperatives, and sign production and sales contracts to ensure timely sales of products. At the same time, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have universally announced the prices of native and sideline products and implemented on-the-spot purchases. Some grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in counties such as Hulan have also set up native and sideline product exhibition rooms to publicize the benefits of developing sideline production to the country and to the farmers themselves.

　　In order to ensure the correct implementation of the price policy of pricing according to quality during the purchase process, the provincial and county supply and marketing departments have trained more than 2,000 technicians for purchasing animal products, medicinal materials, and other sideline products. At the same time, many veteran technicians use the methods of taking on apprentices and contracting teaching to enable a large number of new personnel participating in purchasing work to quickly learn the techniques of identifying various product specifications and quality, which has played a significant role in ensuring the development of purchasing work.

　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th: Many new varieties have recently been added to the purchasing item list of rural grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in the Jinnan area of Shanxi Province. In this way, farmers will generally increase a new batch of income.

　　Nearly eighty kinds of new purchasing items have been opened up, of which thirty-five kinds have already started to be purchased. Among these items, in addition to the locally abundant kapok down, soap pods, natural soda, and rock tea, most of the rest are cattle horns, claws, bones, hoof shells, walnut shells, apricot kernel shells, pomegranate peels, and chicken feathers. Not long ago, these things were discarded everywhere in the countryside. Now, accumulating and collecting them can be sold to the supply and marketing cooperative for money. Some girls and daughters-in-law are very happy to learn that a pound of good chicken feathers can be exchanged for a good piece of soap, and two pounds of Sophora japonica flowers can be exchanged for a foot of calico.

　　Adding new purchasing varieties is a new measure taken by supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Jinnan to help farmers increase income in all aspects. This spring, the supply and marketing cooperatives conducted surveys of new product resources in various parts of the district and actively explored sales channels. After the start of the purchase, they also trained technicians to go deep into the countryside for specific guidance. Counties such as Xiangfen also held exhibitions of samples and prices of newly purchased varieties and toured various places.

    大量收购农村副产品，增加农民收入
    黑龙江等地供销合作社改进工作增加收购品种
    新华社哈尔滨8日电　黑龙江省供销合作社到五月底止，已经收购价值二千四百多万元的农村副业产品，比去年同期收购量增加119％。
    在收购土副产品工作中，各地基层供销社普遍推广了桦川县公胜乡供销社帮助农业合作社做副业生产规划的先进经验，积极为农业合作社找副业生产资源，替社员们算副业收入账，鼓励社员踊跃参加农业社的副业生产，并且签订产销合同。保证及时推销产品。同时，各地供销社普遍公布了土副产品的价格，实行就地收购。呼兰等县的一些基层供销社还设立了土副产品展览室，向农民宣传发展副业生产对国家对自己的好处。
    为了保证在收购中正确执行按等论价的价格政策，省、县供销部门已经训练了两千多名收购畜产、药材等副业产品的技术员。同时许多老技术员用带徒弟和包教包学的办法，使大批新参加收购工作的人员，迅速地学会了鉴定各种产品规格、质量的技术，对保证开展收购工作起了很大作用。
  新华社太原8日电　在山西省晋南专区农村基层供销合作社的收购物品项目表上，最近增加了许多新品种。这样，农民们将要普遍增加一批新的收入。
    新开辟的收购物品，将近八十种，其中有三十五种已经开始收购。这些物品中，除有当地盛产的蒲绒、皂角、土碱、石茶等小土产外，其余大部分是牛角、爪骨、蹄壳、核桃皮、杏核皮、石榴皮和鸡毛等。这些东西不久前在农村还到处扔弃，现在积存和收拾起来就能拿到供销社卖钱。有些姑娘、媳妇们知道一斤好鸡毛能换到一块好肥皂，两斤槐米就能扯一尺花布以后，都非常高兴。
    增添新的收购品种是晋南各级供销社为从各方面帮助农民增加收入的新措施。今年春季，供销社曾在全区各地进行了新产品资源的调查，并且积极开辟销路。开始收购以后，又训练技术员等深入农村具体指导。襄汾等县还举办了收购新品种样品、价格展览，到各地巡回展出。
