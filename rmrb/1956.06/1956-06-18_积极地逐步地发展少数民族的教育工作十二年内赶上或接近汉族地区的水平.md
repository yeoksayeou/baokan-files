Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: The Second National Conference on Ethnic Education concluded in Beijing on the 17th.

On the afternoon of the 17th, Premier Zhou Enlai met with more than one hundred representatives of ethnic education workers from various ethnic groups who attended the conference.

The conference discussed and formulated the "National Ethnic Education Development Program Outline" for the years 1956 to 1967. The conference believed that the planning of ethnic education should be based on the political and economic development of various ethnic regions, especially the foundation of culture and education, and should propose different requirements for different regions. The conference also focused on solving key issues in ethnic education such as language teaching, the training and improvement of ethnic teachers, the supply of ethnic language textbooks, and strengthening leadership; at the same time, it determined the guidelines, tasks, and leadership relations of ethnic institutes.

The "National Ethnic Education Development Program" requires all ethnic minorities to eliminate illiteracy within seven to twelve years, and vigorously develop formal spare-time education on the basis of literacy education; gradually universalize primary school compulsory education within twelve years, so that the enrollment rate of school-age children of ethnic minorities nationwide will reach an average of about 90% by 1967; within twelve years, actively develop junior high schools, and on the basis of the development of junior high schools, vigorously develop ethnic senior high schools. The plan requires that within twelve years, ethnic education work should catch up with or approach the level of Han areas in terms of quantity and quality.

To cooperate with the development of primary and secondary school education, the plan requires running various levels of normal schools well to train and improve teachers. The first priority is to develop ethnic junior normal schools to meet the needs of teachers after the development of ethnic primary schools; with the development of ethnic education, adopt the method of "centralized training and mutual assistance in various regions" to actively prepare for the establishment of ethnic higher normal schools to train ethnic teachers for secondary schools. Within twelve years, new teachers for ethnic primary and secondary schools are required to be basically ethnic minority teachers.

The conference discussed the compilation of teaching syllabuses and textbooks in various ethnic languages according to the principle of ethnic schools implementing teaching in their own ethnic languages.

The conference determined that the main tasks of ethnic institutes in various regions for a certain period in the future are: to continue to train cadres in rotation, improve the political, cultural, and professional level of ethnic minority cadres; to train political, legal, financial, economic, cultural, and educational cadres and some junior and middle-level technical personnel from ethnic minorities and those working in ethnic areas; and to train some ethnic minority primary and secondary school teachers and language work cadres.

    积极地逐步地发展少数民族的教育工作十二年内赶上或接近汉族地区的水平
    新华社17日讯　第二次全国民族教育会议十七日在北京闭幕。
    十七日下午，周恩来总理接见了参加会议的一百多位各民族教育工作者代表。
    这次会议讨论和制定了1956年到1967年全国民族教育事业规划纲要。会议认为，少数民族教育事业规划应该根据各民族地区政治、经济的发展状况，特别是文化教育的基础，对各地区分类提出不同的要求。会议还着重解决了民族教育中语文教学、民族师资的培养和提高、民族文字教材的供应，以及加强领导等关键性问题；同时确定了民族学院的方针任务和领导关系。
    全国民族教育事业规划要求各少数民族分别在七年到十二年内扫除文盲，在识字教育的基础上，大力开展正规的业余教育；十二年内逐步普及小学义务教育，全国少数民族学龄儿童入学率到1967年平均达到90％左右；十二年内，积极发展初级中学，并在发展初中的基础上，大力发展民族高级中学。规划要求，十二年内，民族教育工作应该在数量和质量上赶上或接近汉族地区。
    和中小学教育发展相配合，规划要求办好各级师范，以培养和提高师资。首先是发展民族初级师范学校，以满足民族小学发展后对师资的需要；随着民族教育的发展，采取“集中培养，各区互助”的办法，积极筹设民族高等师范学校，培养中等学校的民族师资。十二年内，民族中、小学的新师资要求基本上由少数民族师资担任。
    会议根据各民族学校贯彻本民族语文进行教学的原则，讨论了编译各民族文字的教学大纲和教材的问题。
    会议确定各地民族学院今后一定时期内的主要任务是：继续轮训干部，提高少数民族干部的政治、文化水平和业务能力；培养少数民族和在民族地区工作的政法、财经、文教干部和一部分初、中等技术人员；培养部分民族中、小学校师资和语文工作干部。
