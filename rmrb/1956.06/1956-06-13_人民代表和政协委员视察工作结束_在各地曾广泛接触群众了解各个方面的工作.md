Xinhua News Agency report: The inspection work of the National People's Congress representatives and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in various regions has basically concluded.

The scope of inspections by representatives and members in various regions was very broad. More than one hundred representatives and members, including Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, and He Xiangning, who inspected in Beijing, have inspected the work of more than one hundred units in industry and agriculture production, politics and law, finance and economics, culture and education, and urban construction in the past month. Representatives and members Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Zhong Tiqian, and others inspected the industrial construction, the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and the cooperative transformation of handicrafts, as well as the agricultural cooperation in the suburbs of Chengdu. Chen Jiageng, Chen Shaokuan, Jiang Yong, Gui Yanfang, Liu Shi, Wu Shaoshu, Xu Baokui, and others inspected various aspects of work, such as industry, agriculture, culture, education, and overseas Chinese affairs, in eleven counties and cities, including Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Jinjiang, in Fujian Province.

The representatives and members extensively contacted the masses during their inspections. The forty-three representatives and members who inspected Zhejiang Province went deep into the grassroots level during their inspections in eighteen cities and counties throughout the province. Huang Shaohong and Mei Ru'ao respectively held forums with lawyers and jurors in Hangzhou to understand the trial work and the defense system, and put forward suggestions for improving judicial work. Gao Shiqi, a representative who was paralyzed, personally went to the workshop to see the production situation of the workers when he inspected the factory in Hangzhou. Jian Bozan also went to the dormitories, families, backstage, and dressing rooms of the staff to understand the staff's living and working conditions when he inspected schools, theaters, libraries, museums, and cultural relics management committees in Changsha City, Hunan Province. Zhang Zhen and Zeng Zesheng conducted inspections in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Turpan, the Kelamayi exploration area of Xinjiang Petroleum Company, and Shihezi New City in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In the Kelamayi exploration area, they saw employees of all ethnic groups working tirelessly day and night despite wind and rain, and expressed their admiration.

Some representatives and members inspected the vast countryside. Deng Yingchao, Xing Zhaotang, and others inspected agricultural production cooperatives in the Luoyang area and the suburbs of Zhengzhou and Luoyang in Henan Province. After in-depth field investigations and visits to farmers' homes, the representatives believed that due to the bumper wheat harvest this year, all localities have conscientiously implemented the principle of "less deduction and more distribution," and more than 90% of the members of these agricultural production cooperatives have increased their income this summer compared with the same period last year. The representatives were satisfied with this. After inspecting the work in Jianhu Township, Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, Shao Lizi and others pointed out that this township purchased thirty-seven double-wheeled double-share plows regardless of the actual situation, resulting in them being shelved due to lack of livestock power and accumulating the funds of agricultural production cooperatives, which was a wrong practice. The representatives who inspected Hainan Island paid great attention to the large amount of wasteland suitable for developing tropical economic crops and the issue of immigration and reclamation on the island, and put forward many positive suggestions to the relevant departments there.

    人民代表和政协委员视察工作结束
    在各地曾广泛接触群众了解各个方面的工作
    据新华社讯　全国人民代表大会代表和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员在各地的视察工作已经基本结束。
    代表和委员们在各地视察的范围很广泛。在北京视察的李济深、黄炎培、何香凝等一百多位代表和委员，近一个月来分别视察了工农业生产、政法、财经、文教、城市建设等一百多个单位的工作。代表和委员刘文辉、邓锡侯、钟体乾等，视察了成都市的工业建设、私营工商业改造和手工业合作化及郊区农业合作化的情况。陈嘉庚、陈绍宽、江庸、蒉延芳、柳湜、吴绍澍、许宝騤等十八人在福建省的福州、厦门、晋江等十一个县市，视察了工农业、文教事业、侨务等各方面的工作。
    代表和委员们在视察的时候广泛地接触了群众。在浙江省视察的四十三位代表和委员在全省十八个市、县视察的时候，都深入基层。黄绍竑、梅汝璈曾分别在杭州市召开了律师和陪审员座谈会，了解了审判工作和辩护制度的情况，并且对司法工作提出了改进的意见。全身瘫痪的代表高士其在杭州市视察工厂的时候，曾亲自到车间看了工人的生产情况。翦伯赞在湖南省长沙市的学校、戏院、图书馆、博物馆、文物管理委员会等单位视察的时候，还到工作人员的宿舍、家庭和戏院的后台、化妆室等地了解工作人员的生活、工作条件。张轸、曾泽生在新疆维吾尔自治区的伊犁哈萨克族自治州、吐鲁番、新疆石油公司克拉玛依探区和石河子新城等地进行了视察。在克拉玛依探区，他们看到各族职工不避风雨、日夜不停地劳动，表示赞佩。
    一部分代表和委员视察了广大农村。邓颖超、邢肇棠等在河南省分别视察了洛阳专区和郑州、洛阳两市郊区的农业生产合作社。经过深入田间、深入农户实地考察以后，代表们认为：由于今年小麦丰收，各地都认真地贯彻执行了“少扣多分”的原则，这些农业生产合作社里的90％以上的社员，今年夏季都较去年同期增加了收入。代表们对这点都感到满意。邵力子等视察了浙江省绍兴县鉴湖乡的工作后，指出这个乡不顾实际情况就购买了三十七部双轮双铧犁，结果因为畜力缺乏而搁置起来，积压了农业生产合作社的资金，是个错误的做法。在海南岛视察的代表们对于这个岛上的大量适于发展热带经济作物的待垦荒地和移民垦殖问题给予极大的注意，并且向当地各有关部门提出了许多积极的建议。
