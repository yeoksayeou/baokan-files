The Chinese football team held its second exhibition match in Calcutta on June 7th, against the Mohammedan Sporting Club football team, one of the outstanding football teams in the Calcutta First Division Football League. The result of the match was a 3-1 victory for the Chinese team.
	Heavy rain fell before and during the match that afternoon, and the entire field was soaked.
	Zhang Honggen scored the first goal for the Chinese team in the eleventh minute of the match. In the twenty-second minute, Nian Weisi scored another point. The Chinese team led 2-0 in the first half.
	At the beginning of the second half, the Mohammedan Sporting Club football team scored a goal in the twenty-eighth minute.
	But within a minute, the Chinese team scored their third goal. This was a remarkable goal. At that time, the Mohammedan Sporting Club football team's defense came up to help their forwards, thus creating a large gap on the right wing of their defense. Nian Weisi cleverly passed the ball to Zhang Honggen, who took full advantage of this opportunity and shot the ball into the net before it hit the ground, resulting in a score of 3-1.

    我国足球队在印度继续比赛
    据新华社新德里8日电　中国足球队六月七日在加尔各答举行了第二次表演赛，对手是加尔各答甲组足球联赛的优秀足球队之一，著名的回教徒体育俱乐部足球队。比赛结果，中国队以三比一获胜。
    当天下午在比赛以前和比赛进行的时候下了大雨，整个球场都湿透了。
    中国队在比赛举行到十一分钟的时候由张宏根攻进了第一球。第二十二分钟，年维泗又得了一分。上半场中国队以二比零领先。
    下半场开始，回教徒体育俱乐部足球队在第二十八分钟的时候踢进了一球。
    但是在一分钟内，中国队踢进了第三球。这是引人注目的一个球。当时，回教徒体育俱乐部足球队的守卫上来帮助他们的前锋，因此在他们的后卫右翼造成了一个很大的空隙。年维泗把球巧妙地传给了张宏根，张宏根充分利用了这个机会，不等球落地就把球射进网，结果踢成了三比一。
