The United Nations Command, after rejecting the proposal made by the Korean-Chinese side on May 28, 1956, for convening a conference of relevant countries on the Korean question, unilaterally announced on May 31 that it would cease implementing the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement concerning the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in areas under the control of the United Nations Command, and demanded that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at designated ports in South Korea withdraw from areas under the control of the United Nations Command within one week. This is an act of blatant violation of the Armistice Agreement.

The functions and powers of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its teams to supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement are an integral and important part of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Since the Korean armistice, the United States has been obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to massively expand and equip the army of Syngman Rhee. The refusal of the United States and other relevant countries on the United Nations Command side to negotiate a solution to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea has made it impossible to fundamentally resolve the practical difficulties already encountered by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in its work. The United States is now taking the further step of unilaterally taking rude and rogue actions to prohibit the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from carrying out its work in South Korea, further threatening the entire Korean Armistice Agreement with destruction. The Chinese government firmly opposes this act of undermining the Armistice Agreement.

In order to maintain the Korean Armistice Agreement, and at the same time taking into account the practical difficulties of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission under the arrogant threats of the United States, the Korean-Chinese side proposed at the Military Armistice Commission on June 4 that both sides agree to the proposal made by the Swedish government to the Chinese government on March 10 to temporarily withdraw the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, but that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission continue to have the right to redeploy these teams to designated ports as a temporary arrangement. However, the United States, disregarding the efforts of the Korean-Chinese side to maintain the Korean Armistice Agreement, rejected this proposal. This attitude of the United States is completely inconsistent with the statement in the note given by the United Nations Command to the Chinese government on May 28 regarding supporting the Armistice Agreement and fully supporting the suggestions of Sweden and Switzerland regarding the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

Under the circumstances that the United Nations Command stubbornly insisted on its unilateral decision, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission suggested to both sides of the Military Armistice Commission on June 5 that the teams at designated ports in the North and South be temporarily withdrawn. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also pointed out that unless both sides of the Military Armistice Commission reached a mutual agreement in this regard, this withdrawal was temporary and did not change the legal status of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The recommendation unanimously adopted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission demonstrated the position of the countries of the commission in maintaining the Armistice Agreement and safeguarding the functions of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

Based on the recommendation of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Korean-Chinese side pointed out at the Military Armistice Commission on June 7:

1. The functions and authority of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams are an integral part of the Armistice Agreement and should not be changed;

2. Although the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams have withdrawn from both the North and South regions, this is a temporary measure. In the event that either side of the armistice makes a well-founded accusation against the other side regarding a violation of the Armistice Agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has the right to send inspection teams to designated ports again.

The Korean-Chinese side suggested that the recommendation of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission be agreed upon based on these two points. However, the position of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Korean-Chinese side in maintaining the Armistice Agreement and the functions of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was once again opposed by the United States, which deliberately sabotaged the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

The Chinese government declares: The Korean Armistice Agreement must not be undermined by the unilateral decisions of the United Nations Command, and the legal status of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will not be altered by the unilateral actions of the United Nations Command. As proposed by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the withdrawal of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams from both the North and South regions is only a temporary measure. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has every right to send teams to designated ports again. The United States and other countries on the United Nations Command side have the full responsibility to abide by the Armistice Agreement and respect the powers and legal status of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Otherwise, they will not be able to escape the condemnation of the people of the world and the full responsibility for undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement.

### 中华人民共和国外交部  关于朝鲜中立国监察委员会暂时撤回南北各特定口岸的视察小组的声明

    关于朝鲜中立国监察委员会暂时撤回南北各特定口岸的视察小组的声明
    1956年6月10日
    联合国军方面在1956年5月28日拒绝朝中方面关于召开朝鲜问题有关国家会议的建议以后，竟又在五月三十一日片面宣布：停止履行朝鲜停战协定中关于中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组在联合国军控制地区内的活动的条款，并且要求驻在南朝鲜各特定口岸的中立国视察小组在一星期以内从联合国军控制地区撤离。这是公然破坏停战协定的行为。
    中立国监察委员会和它的小组监督朝鲜停战协定的实施的职司和权力，是朝鲜停战协定的不可分割的一个重要部分。自从朝鲜停战以来，美国为了大量扩充和装备李承晚的军队，一直在阻挠中立国监察委员会的工作。美国和联合国军方面其他有关国家拒绝协商解决和平统一朝鲜的问题和从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的问题，又使中立国监察委员会在工作中已经遭到的实际困难无从获得根本解决。美国方面现在进而片面采取禁止中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜进行工作的粗暴无赖的行动，更使整个朝鲜停战协定遭受到被破坏的威胁。中国政府坚决反对这种破坏停战协定的行为。
    为了维护朝鲜停战协定，同时照顾到中立国监察委员会在美国方面蛮横威胁下的实际困难，朝中方面在六月四日的军事停战委员会上建议，双方同意瑞典政府在三月十日向中国政府提出的暂时撤回各中立国视察小组，但中立国监察委员会继续有权把这些小组再派驻各特定口岸的建议，作为临时性的安排。但是，美国方面无视朝中方面维护朝鲜停战协定的努力，拒绝了这一建议。美方的这种态度同联合国军方面五月二十八日给中国政府的照会中关于支持停战协定、并且完全支持瑞典、瑞士关于中立国监察委员会的建议的表示，是完全不相符合的。
    中立国监察委员会在联合国军方面横蛮坚持它的片面决定的情况下，在六月五日向军事停战委员会双方建议，暂时撤回南北各特定口岸的小组。中立国监察委员会同时指出，除非军事停战委员会双方在这方面达成了相互的协议，这一撤回是临时的，它并不改变中立国监察委员会的合法地位。中立国监察委员会所一致通过的建议表明了委员会各国维护停战协定和维护中立国监察委员会职权的立场。
    根据中立国监察委员会的建议，朝中方面在六月七日的军事停战委员会上指出：
    一、中立国监察委员会及其视察小组的职权是停战协定不可分割的一部分，不应有所改变；
    二、中立国视察小组虽然自南北地区撤回，但是这是暂时的措施，在停战双方中任何一方就另一方违反停战协定的事件提出有根据的指控的情况下，中立国监察委员会有权再派出视察小组前驻特定口岸。
    朝中方面建议，在这两点的基础上同意中立国监察委员会的建议。但是，中立国监察委员会和朝中方面的维护停战协定和中立国监察委员会职权的立场，又一次遭到蓄意破坏中立国监察委员会的美国方面的反对。
    中国政府声明：朝鲜停战协定决不容许为联合国军方面的片面决定所破坏，中立国监察委员会的合法地位也决不因为联合国军方面的片面行为而有所改变。正如中立国监察委员会所提出，中立国视察小组自南北地区撤出，只是一个临时的措施。中立国监察委员会完全有权再派小组前驻特定口岸。美国和联合国军方面其他国家有完全的责任遵守停战协定，尊重中立国监察委员会的权力和合法地位，否则，他们将不能逃避世界人民的指责和破坏朝鲜停战协定的全部责任。
