This newspaper, Shanghai, June 21st: The Soviet friendly visiting fleet, docked on Shanghai's Huangpu River, warmly received the first group of people to visit their ships today. Those visiting included officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Army and Navy stationed in Shanghai, as well as workers, students, government employees, and residents. As the small boats carrying the visitors approached the warships, Soviet officers and sailors lined up on the ship's rails to warmly welcome them.

Welcome banners were displayed everywhere on the warships. A sunshade awning was also set up on the deck for the visitors. Officers enthusiastically explained the glorious history and equipment of the fleet to the visitors. Soviet officers and soldiers also had cordial conversations with the visiting masses, exchanging gifts. Some took photos and signed autographs on the warships as mementos.

When the people finished their visits and boarded the small boats, the Soviet officers and soldiers again lined up to see them off, singing "Moscow-Beijing" and shouting "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" in their newly learned Chinese.

This morning, the PLA Navy Political Department's Performing Arts Troupe also performed songs and dances on the Soviet cruiser.

    苏联军舰接待上海人民参观
    本报上海21日电　停泊在上海黄浦江上的苏联友好访华舰队，今天热情地接待了第一批登舰参观的人们。前往参观的有驻上海的人民解放军陆、海军军官和士兵，以及工人、学生、机关工作人员和居民。当载着参观者的小艇靠近军舰时，苏军军官和水兵在舰舷列队热情欢迎。
    军舰上到处贴着欢迎的标语。甲板上还为参观者搭起了遮阳的凉篷。军官们热情地为参观者讲解舰队的光荣历史和设备。苏军官兵们并同参观的群众亲切地交谈，相互交换礼物。有的在军舰上照相、签名留作纪念。
    当人们参观完毕登上小艇时，苏军官兵们又排队欢送，高唱“莫斯科—北京”，并用才学会的中国话喊着“中苏友好万岁”。
    今天上午，中国人民解放军海军政治部文艺工作团还在苏联巡洋舰上表演了歌舞。
