To the Editor:

The Xinhua Bookstore, Linhai Branch in Zhejiang Province, has a large backlog of books. The store's first-quarter inventory quota was 32,200 yuan, but it actually reached 54,000 yuan. According to the branch managers' meeting held in the province in March, other branches also have similar situations.

The main reason for this situation is that the book distribution figures required by the higher-level bookstore are not in line with the actual situation. They subjectively decide the number of books to be distributed based on the number of agricultural cooperatives in the county. For example, books such as "Compilation of Rural Work Experience in Zhejiang Province in 1955" are required to have one copy per cooperative, and books such as "Illustrated Outline of Agricultural Development" have even higher requirements. However, in reality, agricultural cooperatives vary in size, and the cultural level of the members and the economic conditions of the cooperatives are different, so the sales of books cannot meet the requirements of the higher levels. For example, the cadres of the Xiaqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburban township said to the bookstore staff: "We don't have money now, we'll buy it in the second half of the year!" Thanks to the mobilization of a comrade from the county party committee's propaganda department, the cooperative bought a copy of "How to Be a Good Cooperative Member."

Another important reason is the "too late" phenomenon in publishing and distribution work. For example, last October, farmers actively demanded to establish cooperatives, but they could not buy books on cooperative policies in bookstores. By December, many farmers were already brewing to establish advanced cooperatives, but books such as "Answers to Questions on Setting Up Cooperatives," "Promoting the Policy of Cooperation," and "The Issue of Livestock Entering Cooperatives" were only published then, so most of them were backlogged. Books on establishing advanced cooperatives were not published until early March this year, but by this time farmers were already preparing for spring plowing. For example, the rural areas across the country began to study the Outline of Agricultural Development before the Spring Festival and urgently needed popular illustrated books; however, my store did not receive 3,000 copies of "Illustrated Outline of Agricultural Development" until March 15th, resulting in a backlog of more than 2,800 copies. For another example, farmers are urgently in need of books on the Chinese character simplification plan recently. According to statistics, our county needs a total of 40,000 copies, but the higher-level bookstore only allocated 15,000 copies to us. We received the first batch of 2,200 copies on March 18th, and they were sold out by the 22nd. Since then, 20 to 30 people have been asking about them every day.

I suggest that the relevant leading organs study this issue and quickly improve the publishing and distribution of books in rural areas.

### 做好农村图书的出版发行工作

    做好农村图书的出版发行工作编辑同志：
    新华书店浙江省临海支店积压了大批图书。这个书店第一季度存货的定额是三万二千二百元，但是实际上却达到了五万四千元。据三月份全省召开的支店经理会议上反映，其他支店也都有类似情况。
    造成这一情况的主要原因，是上级书店对图书发行数字的要求不切合实际情况。他们主观地以全县农业社的数目来决定书籍的发行册数。如“浙江省1955年农村工作经验汇编”等书要求每社有一本，“农业发展纲要图解”等书的要求更高。但是实际上，农业社有大有小，社员文化水平和社里经济情况都不同，因此书籍的推销情况，就不能符合上级的要求。如城郊乡下桥农业生产合作社的干部就向书店的工作人员说：“现在没有钱，下半年再买吧！”由于县委宣传部一位同志帮助动员，这个社才买了一本“怎样做个好社员”。
    另外一个重要原因，是出版发行工作有“马后炮”的现象。像去年十月份农民积极要求办社，在书店里却买不到有关办社政策的书籍。等到十二月份，很多农民已经在酝酿办高级社了，“办社问题解答”、“宣传合作化政策”、“耕畜入社问题”等书籍才出版，因此大部分都积压了下来。办高级社的书一直到今年三月初才出版，可是这时农民已经在备耕了。又如，全国农村在春节前就开始学习农业发展纲要，很需要通俗图解一类的书籍；但是一直到三月十五日我店才收到了三千本“农业发展纲要图解”，结果积存了两千八百多本。再如，最近农民迫切需要有关汉字简化方案的书籍，据统计我县共需要四万本，但是上级书店只分配给我们一万五千本。第一批发来的二千二百本，我们在三月十八日收到，到二十二日就卖完了，在这以后每天都有二、三十人来询问。
    我建议有关领导机关研究一下这个问题，迅速改进农村的图书出版发行工作。
