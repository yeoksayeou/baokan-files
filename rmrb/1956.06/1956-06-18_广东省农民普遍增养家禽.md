(Reported by this newspaper) Poultry production in Guangdong Province, which had been stagnant for some time, is now universally active again. Since the beginning of summer, almost every household in rural areas has added chickens, geese, and ducks. On the rivers and waterways of the Pearl River Delta, flocks of small yellow ducks are now swimming and foraging. The Lion Head geese produced in the Chaoshan area weigh more than twenty catties each, with thick and delicious meat. This year, the entire region will raise more than 1,035,000 of them, and many cooperatives have increased their breeding by three to five times compared to last year. The Zhanjiang Special District has achieved "every household raises pigs, every household raises chickens," and the entire district will increase poultry raising to more than 8.7 million this year.

In order to ensure the development of poultry production, agricultural departments in various regions have actively trained poultry hatching personnel, and promoted advanced breeding techniques through breeding experience exchange meetings and exhibitions. Supply and marketing cooperatives in 26 counties including Xinhui and Yangjiang have also transferred and purchased more than 1.8 million excellent chicks, ducklings, and goslings, and supplied them to farmers for raising in a timely manner.

    广东省农民普遍增养家禽
    本报讯　广东省停滞许久的家禽生产现在已经普遍活跃起来。入夏以后，各地农村几乎家家户户都添养了鸡、鹅和鸭子。珠江三角洲的大小河面上，现在已有成群的黄色小鸭在游动觅食。潮汕地区出产的狮头大鹅，每只有二十多斤重，肉厚味美，今年全区将饲养一百零三万五千多只，有许多社已经比去年增养了三倍到五倍。湛江专区做到了“家家饲猪，户户养鸡”，全区今年家禽将增养到八百七十万只以上。
    为了保证家禽生产的发展，各地农业部门积极训练了家禽孵雏手，通过饲养经验交流会和展览会等方式，推广先进的饲养技术。新会、阳江等二十六个县的供销合作部门还调购了一百八十多万只优良的鸡雏、鸭雏和鹅雏，及时供给农民养育。
