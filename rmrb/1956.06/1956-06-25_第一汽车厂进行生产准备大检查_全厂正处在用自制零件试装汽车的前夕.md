Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 24th. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is currently on the eve of trial assembly of cars using parts produced by itself. Since August of last year, all thirteen basic workshops in the factory, with the exception of a few workshops and individual units, have completed production adjustments. Four workshops, including the chassis workshop, have already entered trial production using formal organized production methods.

Recently, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant conducted a production preparation inspection lasting nearly a month. The inspection pointed out that more than 80% of the parts required for car production can now be manufactured according to the designed process, and assembled into more than ten assemblies such as engines, rear axles, front axles, gearboxes, and car bodies. Most of the cooperative products, metal materials, and tools required for this year's car production have been supplied. In terms of production management, systems for production, finance, planning, and scheduling have been established.

The inspection also found some problems in various production preparation work and proposed some solutions.

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. The two headlights used on the front of the domestically produced Jiefang (Liberation) brand car have been successfully manufactured by the Beijing First Automobile Accessory Factory. The first batch of products has already been shipped to Changchun today.

Inside the lampshade of this type of lamp, there are fifty-candlepower light bulbs, but the light it emits is brighter than eighteen thousand candlepower because there is a very delicate reflector inside the lamp.

Workers and technicians at the First Automobile Accessory Factory call these headlights the "eyes" of the Jiefang brand car, so they didn't let go of even the smallest problem during the trial production. After the reflector inside the lamp was silver-plated, some small white spots appeared. They specially invited a Soviet expert from Changchun to help eliminate this shortcoming. Some small fingerprints appeared on the outer shell of the lamp. Workers and technicians from the stamping and assembly workshops found the cause of the shortcomings and used better methods to polish the outer shell. As a result, the outer shell was polished brighter than a mirror and flatter than glass.

    第一汽车厂进行生产准备大检查
    全厂正处在用自制零件试装汽车的前夕
    新华社长春24日电　第一汽车制造厂目前正处在用自己生产的零件试装汽车的前夕。从去年八月开始到现在，全厂十三个基本车间除个别车间和个别单位外，都已经结束了调整生产。底盘等四个车间，已经按照正式组织生产的方法转入了流水试生产。
    最近，第一汽车制造厂进行了为时近一月的生产准备大检查。检查指出，生产汽车所需要的零件，已经有80％以上能够按照设计的工艺制造出来，并且把它们装配成发动机、后桥、前轴、变速箱、车箱等十多个总成。今年生产汽车所需要的协作产品，金属材料和工具等大部分得到了供应。在生产管理方面，已经建立了生产、财务、计划、调度等项制度。
    检查中也发现了在各项生产准备工作中还存在一些问题，并提出一些解决办法。
    新华社23日讯　国产解放牌汽车上前面所用的两只大灯，在北京第一汽车附件厂制造成功。首批产品已经在今天运往长春。
    在这种灯的灯罩里边，安有五十支光的灯泡，可是它发射出来的光比一万八千支光还亮，因为灯里有一个非常精致的反光镜。
    第一汽车附件厂的工人和技术人员，把这种大灯叫着解放牌汽车上的眼睛，因此他们在试制当中连一点小问题也没有放过。灯里的反光镜上镀过银以后出现了一些小白点，他们特地从长春请来一位苏联专家帮助消灭了这个缺点；灯的外壳上有了些小指痕，冲压和装配两个车间的工人和技术人员找出了产生缺点的原因，并且改用更好的方法磨制外壳，结果把外壳磨得比镜子还亮，比玻璃还平。
