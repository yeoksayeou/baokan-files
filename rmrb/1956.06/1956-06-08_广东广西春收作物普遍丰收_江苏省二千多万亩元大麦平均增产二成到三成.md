    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th. Guangdong Province has achieved a universal good harvest of over eighteen million mu of spring crops. Among them, the unit area yield of grain crops increased from 85 jin last year to 133.3 jin, with a total increase of more than 900 million jin. The unit area yield of oil crops also increased by 111% compared to last year, with a total increase of more than 10 million jin. Many agricultural cooperatives have also seen high-yield fields with more than 400 jin of wheat per mu.
    This year's spring crops were all planted last winter, with the planting area expanding by more than four million mu compared to the previous year, making it the largest winter planting scale in Guangdong's history. After these crops were planted, they suffered several threats from cold waves. Agricultural cooperatives in various places generally adopted cold-proof measures such as watering, smoking, and covering with rice straw to ensure a good harvest.
    At present, agricultural departments in various regions are studying some specific issues in winter planting based on the situation of spring crops. For example, how to coordinate spring harvest and spring planting in terms of time and labor use, how winter planting fertilization will not affect the needs of spring planting, and which crops are beneficial to soil maintenance when planted in winter. This research work will provide useful information for arranging winter planting and promoting a three-crop-a-year system.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 7th. The spring crops in Guangxi Province have been harvested, with a universal good harvest of over ten million mu of wheat, rapeseed, sweet potatoes, and other crops.
    Wheat, which accounts for more than half of the spring crops, has an average unit area yield increase of nearly 40% compared to last year, and a total output increase of 1.3 times. The unit area yield of rapeseed increased by 43% compared to last year.
    The spring crop area in Guangxi Province this year increased by more than three million mu compared to last year. According to the person in charge of the Guangxi Provincial Agricultural Department, the main reason for the good harvest is that last winter, farmers of all ethnic groups generally changed the wheat from broadcasting to strip planting or spot planting, and changed the habit of not cultivating and not fertilizing various spring crops. In addition, the rainfall was relatively even last winter and this spring.
    At present, agricultural production cooperatives in various places are carrying out spring harvest distribution work.
    Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th. Over twenty million mu of Yuan barley in Jiangsu Province has achieved a universal good harvest. The total output increased by nearly 10% compared to the plan and 20% to 30% compared to last year. This year, the more than fifteen million mu of Yuan barley in the key production areas of Nantong, Yancheng, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang yielded an average of 150 jin per mu, an increase of 10% to 20% compared to last year; the counties in the cotton-producing areas of Songjiang and Suzhou had particularly good Yuan barley harvests this year, yielding an average of about 750 jin per mu, an increase of 30% to 50% compared to last year; Ganyu, Donghai, and other counties also increased by more than 50% compared to last year.
    The province's more than thirty-four million mu of wheat has also generally turned yellow and ripened. It is estimated that Xuzhou, Nantong, Suzhou, Songjiang, and other places can increase production by 5%-20% compared to the plan; in Huaiyin, Yangzhou, Yancheng, and other places, due to continuous rainfall in the past half month, wheat in many areas has been harmed by rust disease, and the output may not be as good as last year. At present, farmers are actively carrying out rush harvesting and rush planting to ensure a bumper harvest of summer and autumn crops.

    广东广西春收作物普遍丰收
    江苏省二千多万亩元大麦平均增产二成到三成
    新华社广州7日电　广东省一千八百多万亩春收作物普遍丰收。其中粮食作物的单位面积产量从去年的八十五斤增加到一三三点三斤，共增产九亿多斤。油料作物的单位面积产量也比去年增加111％，共增产一千万多斤。不少农业社还出现了每亩产小麦四百斤以上的丰产田。
    今年春收作物都是在去年冬季种下的，播种面积比前年扩大了四百多万亩，为广东省历来冬种规模最大的一年。这些作物种下以后，曾经遭受过几次寒潮的威胁。各地农业社普遍采取灌水、熏烟、盖稻草等防寒措施，保证了丰收。
    目前各地农业部门正根据春收作物的情况，研究冬种中的一些专门问题。比如春收和春种在时间上和劳动力使用上如何才能协调，冬种的施肥怎样才不致影响春种的需要，以及冬季播种那些作物才有利于地力的保养等等。这项研究工作将为安排冬种和推行一年三熟制提供有益的资料。
    新华社南宁7日电　广西省春收作物收割完毕，一千多万亩小麦、油菜、甘薯等作物普遍丰收。
    占春收作物一半以上的小麦，平均单位面积产量比去年增加近40％，总产量增加一点三倍。油菜子单位面积产量比去年增加43％。
    广西省今年春收作物面积比去年增加三百多万亩。据广西省农业部门负责人说，丰收的原因主要是去冬各族农民普遍把小麦由撒播改为条播或点播，并且改变了对各种春收作物不中耕、不施肥的习惯。此外，去冬今春雨水比较均匀。
    现在，各地农业生产合作社正在进行春收分配工作。
    本报南京7日电　江苏省二千多万亩元大麦普遍丰收。总产量比计划增产近一成，比去年增产二到三成。南通、盐城、扬州、镇江等重点产区的一千五百多万亩元大麦，今年平均每亩收一百五十斤，比去年增产一到二成；松江、苏州产棉区各县，今年元大麦收成特别好，平均每亩收七百五十斤左右，比去年增产三到五成；赣榆、东海等县也比去年增产五成多。
    全省三千四百多万亩小麦也已经普遍黄熟。徐州、南通、苏州、松江等地，估计可以比计划增产5％—20％；淮阴、扬州、盐城等地，由于近半月来连续降雨，不少地区的小麦已遭锈病为害，产量可能不如去年。目前，农民们正在积极进行抢收抢种，保证夏熟和秋熟的丰收。
