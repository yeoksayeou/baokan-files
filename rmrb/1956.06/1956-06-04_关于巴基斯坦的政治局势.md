    On the Political Situation in Pakistan
    Jiang Yuanchun
    The recent developments in the domestic political situation in Pakistan have attracted close attention and importance.
    Currently, both the governments of East Pakistan and West Pakistan provinces, which constitute the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, are facing crises. In East Pakistan Province, due to the opposition party having a majority in the Legislative Assembly, the current provincial government, composed of the United Front – mainly the Krishak Sramik Party – is finding it difficult to continue to exercise effective rule. In West Pakistan Province, the Muslim League, which originally held a dominant position in the Provincial Legislative Assembly, has fallen into serious division and its strength has been greatly weakened, while the newly formed Republican Party, headed by the Chief Minister of the Provincial Government, Sahib Khan, has rapidly gained a pivotal position in the Legislative Assembly.
    As everyone knows, the current central government of Pakistan is jointly composed of the Muslim League and the United Front. Therefore, the failures of the Muslim League in West Pakistan and the United Front in East Pakistan cannot but seriously affect the stability of the central government.
    The emergence of crises in the East Pakistan and West Pakistan governments is not accidental. Beneath the surface of party struggles lies the deep-seated and strong desire of the Pakistani people for a change in the government's domestic and foreign policies. The formation of the government crisis demonstrates that the people's demands are driving the development of the situation.
    The current coalition cabinet of the Muslim League and the United Front, headed by Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, is itself the result of the Pakistani people's opposition to the Muslim League's policies. Since the partition of Pakistan and India, the Muslim League, which had been ruling alone, pursued a policy of following the United States in expanding its military and preparing for war, and joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization organized by the United States. This policy has led to Pakistan's increasing isolation in Asia, a decline in its international prestige, and a severe deterioration of Pakistan's economic situation. The Muslim League's domestic and foreign policies were opposed by the people, causing it to fail in the 1955 Constituent Assembly elections, winning only thirty-two seats out of eighty, thus contributing to the establishment of the current coalition government.
    The Muhammad Ali government has taken some positive measures in its domestic and foreign policies. However, on the other hand, the Ali government also joined the Baghdad Pact, and some of its domestic policies have been opposed by the people. As the international situation tends towards detente, the expansion of peaceful regions in Asia, and the growth of peaceful forces, Pakistani public opinion is increasingly demanding that the government adopt a policy of peace and neutrality, not participate in military blocs, and take democratic steps in domestic policy. This situation has caused the divisions that already existed within the Muslim League and the United Front to further surface.
    In East Pakistan, the ruling United Front had in fact already split. The United Front was formed in March 1954, when the East Pakistan Legislative Assembly elections were held, by the East Pakistan Awami Muslim League, the Krishak Sramik Party, the Democratic Party, the Islamic Organization, and some non-partisan figures. At that time, the United Front put forward a twenty-one-point program, which included progressive propositions such as the abolition of the landlord system without compensation, the development of industry, and the abolition of the Security Act, which allows people to be detained without trial. Therefore, it gained the support of the people and won a great victory in the Legislative Assembly elections, thus ending the long-term rule of the Muslim League in East Pakistan.
    The East Pakistan Provincial Government formed by the United Front was dissolved by the Central Government in May 1954, and later restored in June 1955 under the opposition of the people. After that, because the Krishak Sramik Party did not resolutely implement the twenty-one-point program and supported the Muslim League's policies in domestic and foreign affairs, the United Front split. The East Pakistan Awami Muslim League and the Democratic Party withdrew from the United Front and became the opposition party in the Provincial Legislative Assembly. They demanded the implementation of the twenty-one-point program.
    Because the opposition party had a majority in the Legislative Assembly, the provincial government, mainly composed of the Krishak Sramik Party, was in an unstable state. With the recent famine in East Pakistan, the people became increasingly dissatisfied with the government. On May 22, the Legislative Assembly discussed the provincial government's budget, which was opposed by the Awami Muslim League, and the Speaker announced an indefinite adjournment of the Legislative Assembly. Governor Huq then ordered the Legislative Assembly to close on the 24th. Pakistani President Mirza also announced on the 26th the suspension of the constitution in East Pakistan, and ruled by the President according to the constitution. At the same time, the Awami Muslim League, the largest opposition party in the Legislative Assembly, demanded that it form the provincial government.
    On June 1, Pakistani President Mirza announced the restoration of the constitution in East Pakistan and approved the budget proposed by the provincial government, enabling the Krishak Sramik Party government to continue in power. At the same time, the Legislative Assembly will not be able to meet until the Governor orders it to reconvene.
    But it is clear that this step can only temporarily resolve the crisis, and the struggle between the ruling and opposition parties will undoubtedly become more acute.
    The crisis in the West Pakistan provincial government was caused by the West Pakistan provincial organization of the Muslim League demanding the resignation of Sahib Khan, the Chief Minister of the provincial government. Sahib Khan was originally a non-partisan person who advocated maintaining friendly relations with all neighboring countries, especially India and Afghanistan. He had the support of the Muslim League when he became Chief Minister. However, in early April of this year, the Muslim League caucus in the West Pakistan Provincial Legislative Assembly decided that, since the Muslim League had a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, only the leader of the Muslim League could serve as Chief Minister of the provincial government, and therefore demanded Sahib Khan's resignation.
    In order to counter the demands of the Muslim League, Sahib Khan announced on April 23 that he had organized a political party called the Republican Party. He announced that the party's mission was to "serve the people, save democracy in Pakistan, and defeat all saboteurs." Although the Republican Party has not announced a clear program, it has immediately received the support and support of many people. The appearance of the Republican Party caused a split within the Muslim League. A large number of Muslim League members in the West Pakistan Legislative Assembly defected to the Republican Party. In the election of the Speaker of the West Pakistan Provincial Assembly on May 20, the candidates of the Muslim League and the Republican Party received the same number of votes, and finally the candidate of the Republican Party won by the vote cast by the Chairman. This election showed that the two parties were in a roughly equal position in the Legislative Assembly. It is said that after the Speaker election, another group of Muslim League members defected and joined the Republican Party. But the Muslim League is not willing to give up, so the struggle will continue.
    The political situation in both East and West Pakistan shows the fact that the power and influence of the Muslim League, which has been in power for a long time, is declining, and this is the result of its policy of following the United States and participating in military blocs. This fact has made all political parties in Pakistan realize that the future of a political party depends on whether it has the support of the people and whether its policies meet the needs of the people. Therefore, in the process of political turmoil in Pakistan, there are already significant signs that not only the opposition party has put forward a program that meets the requirements of the people, but also the ruling party is taking certain measures to seek the support of the people.
    For example, on May 21, on the eve of the Legislative Assembly's discussion of the budget in East Pakistan, the East Pakistan Provincial Government decided to comply with the demands of opposition parties, mass organizations, and the people, and release all political prisoners detained under the Public Security Act. Sahib Khan, the Chief Minister of the West Pakistan Provincial Government, also announced on May 24 that he would propose a bill to abolish the Security Act.
    The Awami Muslim League and other opposition parties in East Pakistan are rumored to have reached a five-point agreement to conduct a joint election, advocating to deal with the threat of food crisis and floods, abolish all security laws and guarantee civil liberties, reduce administrative expenses and take effective measures to stop the emigration of minorities. The Awami Muslim League Council also decided on its program on May 20, advocating the implementation of an independent and neutral foreign policy, withdrawing from military blocs; implementing the twenty-one-point program; immediately releasing all political prisoners; and solving the food shortage.
    The current development of the political situation in East and West Pakistan will undoubtedly affect the domestic and foreign policies of the central government of Pakistan, and this influence will be unfavorable to the US conspiracy to continue to use Pakistan to create tensions in Asia. This prospect cannot but alarm the United States. American newspapers are already using nasty words such as "weak leadership," "despicable politics and administrative clumsiness" to insult Pakistan's government and political parties, and are worried that Pakistan has a large "neutral sentiment." The "New York Times" on May 28 also suggested giving Pakistan more "aid" in an attempt to control the situation in Pakistan. But these efforts by the United States will be in vain. The people of Pakistan will decide for themselves what they need.

    关于巴基斯坦的政治局势
    蒋元椿
    巴基斯坦国内最近政治局势的发展，受到了人们的密切注意和重视。
    目前，组成巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的东巴基斯坦省和西巴基斯坦省的政府，都出现了危机。在东巴基斯坦省，由于反对党在立法会议中占有优势，现在的由联合阵线——主要是农工党——组成的省政府，已经难以继续实行有效的统治。在西巴基斯坦省，在省立法会议中本来占优势的回教联盟陷于严重的分裂，力量大为削弱，而新成立的以省政府的首席部长萨希布汗为首的共和党，却迅速地在立法会议中取得了举足轻重的地位。
    正如大家所知道的，现在的巴基斯坦的中央政府是由回教联盟和联合阵线联合组成的。因此，回教联盟在西巴基斯坦以及联合阵线在东巴基斯坦所遭到的失败，不能不严重地影响了中央政府的稳定。
    东巴基斯坦和西巴基斯坦政府危机的出现，并不是偶然的。在政党斗争的表面下面，深深地埋藏着的根是巴基斯坦人民对于改变政府内外政策的强烈要求。政府危机的形成，正是表明了人民的这种要求正在推动着局势的发展。
    现在的以穆罕默德·阿里总理为首的回教联盟和联合阵线的联合内阁的组成，本身就是巴基斯坦人民反对回教联盟的政策的结果。从巴基斯坦和印度分治以来，一直单独执政的回教联盟奉行了追随美国扩军备战的政策，参加了美国所组织的东南亚集团。这种政策造成了巴基斯坦在亚洲的日益孤立，国际威信的下降，并且使巴基斯坦的经济状况极端恶化。回教联盟的内外政策遭到人民的反对，使它在1955年的制宪议会选举中遭到失败，在八十席中只得到了三十二席，因而促成了现在的联合政府的成立。
    穆罕默德·阿里政府在对内对外政策方面都采取了一些积极的措施。但是另一方面，阿里政府又参加了巴格达条约，它的对内政策的某些措施也遭到了人民的反对。随着国际局势的趋向和缓、亚洲和平地区的扩大和和平力量的增长，巴基斯坦舆论越来越强烈地要求政府采取和平中立的政策，不参加军事集团，并且要求在对内政策上采取民主的步骤。这种形势促使在回教联盟和联合阵线内部本来就存在着的分歧进一步趋于表面化。
    在东巴基斯坦，执政的联合阵线实际上早已发生了分裂。联合阵线是在1954年3月东巴基斯坦举行立法会议选举的时候，由东巴基斯坦人民回教联盟、农工党、民主党、伊斯兰组织和一些无党派人士组成的。联合阵线当时提出了一个二十一点纲领，其中包含有无偿地废除地主制度、发展工业、废除规定可以不进行审判而拘留人的安全法等进步主张，因而获得了人民的支持，并且在立法会议选举中获得了巨大的胜利，从而结束了回教联盟在东巴基斯坦的长期执政。
    联合阵线所组成的东巴基斯坦省政府，在1954年5月间曾经被中央政府解散，以后在人民的反对下在1955年6月又重新恢复。在这以后，由于农工党没有坚决执行二十一点纲领，在对内对外政策上支持回教联盟的政策，联合阵线发生了分裂。东巴基斯坦人民回教联盟和民主党退出了联合阵线，成为省立法会议中的反对党。它们要求实现二十一点纲领。
    由于反对党在立法会议中占有优势，因此主要由农工党组成的省政府处于不稳定的状态。随着最近在东巴基斯坦发生的粮荒，人民对政府越来越不满意。五月二十二日，立法会议讨论省政府的预算，遭到人民回教联盟的反对，议长宣布立法会议无限期休会。省长胡克随着在二十四日命令立法会议闭会。巴基斯坦总统米尔扎并在二十六日宣布在东巴基斯坦停止实行宪法，按照宪法规定由总统实行统治。同时，立法会议中最大的反对党人民回教联盟要求由它来组织省政府。
    六月一日，巴基斯坦总统米尔扎宣布在东巴基斯坦恢复实行宪法，并且批准了省政府所提出的预算，使得农工党的政府能够继续执政。同时，在省长下令立法会议复会以前，立法会议将不能开会。
    但是很明显，这一步骤只能暂时地解决危机，而执政党和反对党之间的斗争无疑将更加尖锐起来。
    西巴基斯坦省政府的危机，是由于回教联盟的西巴基斯坦省组织要求省政府的首席部长萨希布汗辞职而引起的。萨希布汗本来是无党派人士，他曾经主张和一切邻国、特别是印度和阿富汗保持友好。他在出任首席部长的时候，曾经得到回教联盟的支持。但是在今年四月初，在西巴基斯坦省立法会议中的回教联盟党团决定，由于回教联盟在立法会议中拥有多数席位，只有回教联盟的领袖才可以出任省政府的首席部长，因而要求萨希布汗辞职。
    为了对抗回教联盟的要求，萨希布汗在四月二十三日宣布他组织了一个名为共和党的政党。他宣布这个党的任务是为“人民服务，为巴基斯坦拯救民主和击败一切破坏分子”。虽然共和党还没有宣布明确的纲领，但是立刻受到了许多人的拥护和支持。共和党的出现在回教联盟内部引起了分裂。西巴基斯坦立法会议中的属于回教联盟的议员，大批地退盟转向共和党。在五月二十日西巴基斯坦省议会议长选举中，回教联盟和共和党的候选人得到了同样的票数，最后以主席所投的一票使共和党候选人获胜。这次选举表明两党在立法会议中已经处于势均力敌的地位。据说，在议长选举以后，又有一批属于回教联盟的议员退盟参加了共和党。但是回教联盟并不愿意就此罢休，因此斗争还将继续下去。
    巴基斯坦东西两个省份的政治局势都说明了这样一个事实，曾经长期执政的回教联盟的力量和影响正在下降，而这是它执行追随美国、参加军事集团的政策的结果。这个事实使巴基斯坦的所有政党都认识到，一个政党的前途决定于它是否得到人民的支持，它的政策是否符合人民的要求。因此，在巴基斯坦政局动荡的过程中，已经有显著的迹象表明，不仅反对党提出了适应人民要求的纲领，就是执政党也在采取某些措施来寻求人民的支持。
    例如，在东巴基斯坦立法会议讨论预算的前夕，五月二十一日，东巴基斯坦省政府决定顺应反对党派、群众团体和人民的要求，释放根据公共安全法被拘留着的全部政治犯。西巴基斯坦省政府首席部长萨希布汗也在五月二十四日宣布要提出废除安全法的法案。
    东巴基斯坦的人民回教联盟等反对党派，据传已经达成了五点协议，决定进行联合竞选，主张应付粮食危机和洪水的威胁，废除所有的安全法和保证公民自由，削减行政费用和采取有效措施制止少数民族迁出。人民回教联盟理事会并在五月二十日决定了自己的纲领，主张执行独立而中立的外交政策，退出军事集团；实现二十一点纲领；立即释放全部政治犯；解决粮荒等。
    目前东巴基斯坦和西巴基斯坦政治局势的发展，无疑将对巴基斯坦中央政府的对内对外政策发生影响，而这种影响将会不利于美国继续利用巴基斯坦在亚洲制造紧张局势的阴谋。这个前景不能不使美国感到惊慌。美国报纸已经在用“软弱的领导”、“卑鄙的政治和行政方面的笨拙”等等恶劣的词句辱骂巴基斯坦的政府和政党，并且担心巴基斯坦潜伏着很大的“中立情绪”。“纽约时报”在五月二十八日并且建议给予巴基斯坦以规模更大的“援助”，企图借此控制巴基斯坦的局势。但是美国的这些努力将是徒劳的。巴基斯坦人民将要自己来决定他们需要些什么。
