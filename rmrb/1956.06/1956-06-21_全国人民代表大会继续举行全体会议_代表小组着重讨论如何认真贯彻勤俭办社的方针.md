Xinhua News Agency, June 20th - Conscientiously implementing the policy of running cooperatives thriftily was an issue emphasized by many delegates during the group discussions of the "Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" this morning at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress.

The delegate groups from Guangdong, Shandong, and other provinces believed in their discussions that the regulations regarding thriftiness in running cooperatives are very necessary. Some delegates from the Guangdong delegate group pointed out that some agricultural producers' cooperatives currently still have extravagant and wasteful practices. Some cooperatives purchase excessive amounts of production materials too early, without considering actual needs, resulting in waste. One cooperative spent two thousand yuan to build a pigsty. A representative from the Shandong delegate group used specific facts to illustrate the benefits of running cooperatives thriftily. He said that his cooperative, by reducing unnecessary expenses and concentrating on developing agriculture, while also developing more than ten kinds of sideline production, had universally increased the income of its members.

Some delegates from the delegate groups of Henan, Jilin, Hunan, and other provinces pointed out in their discussions that to run agricultural producers' cooperatives well, it is also necessary to continuously improve production techniques. Some delegates from the Hunan delegate group believed that the regulations regarding the adoption of new farm tools and improved seeds to improve agricultural techniques are good, but they must be adapted to local conditions during implementation. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hunan province suffered considerable losses in production because they did not grasp this point sufficiently.

The delegate groups from Zhejiang, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities believed in their discussions yesterday and today that the regulations regarding strengthening the political work of agricultural producers' cooperatives are very important. A representative from the Tianjin delegate group used a comparison of the work of two cooperatives to illustrate the necessity of strengthening political work. Some delegates from the Zhejiang delegate group pointed out that the political work of some agricultural producers' cooperatives in Zhejiang province is currently very weak, which is detrimental to consolidating the agricultural producers' cooperatives.

Many delegates from the delegate groups of Hubei, Shanxi, and other provinces expressed satisfaction with the regulations in the charter regarding caring for the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled members, considering that this demonstrates the superiority of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives.

As of this morning, nearly one-third of the delegate groups have concluded their discussion of the "Model Regulations (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives." A small number of delegate groups have already discussed the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

    新华社20日讯　认真贯彻勤俭办社的方针，是第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议今天上午分组讨论“高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”的时候，许多代表着重指出的一个问题。
    广东、山东等省代表小组在讨论中，认为章程中有关勤俭办社的规定是十分必要的。广东省代表小组有的代表指出，目前有些农业生产合作社还存在着铺张浪费现象，有的社不根据实际需要，过多、过早地购买生产资料，造成浪费，有的社盖一个猪圈花了两千元。山东省代表小组的一位代表用具体事实说明勤俭办社的好处。他说，他所在的社由于减少了不必要的开支，集中力量发展农业，同时又发展了十多种副业生产，使社员收入普遍增加。
    河南、吉林、湖南等省代表小组有些代表在讨论中指出：要办好农业生产合作社，还要不断地改进生产技术。湖南省代表小组有的代表认为章程中有关采用新式农具、采用优良种子等改进农业技术的规定很好，但在执行中要因地制宜；湖南省有些农业生产合作社因为对这一点掌握不够，生产中受到了不少损失。
    浙江、天津等省市代表小组在昨天和今天的讨论中，认为章程中关于加强农业生产合作社的政治工作的规定很重要。天津市代表小组一位代表用两个社工作的对比，说明加强政治工作的必要性。浙江省代表小组有些代表指出，目前浙江省有些农业生产合作社的政治工作很薄弱，这对于巩固农业生产合作社是不利的。
    湖北、山西等省的代表小组不少代表在讨论中，对于章程中关于照顾老、弱、孤、寡、残疾的社员的规定，表示满意，认为这显示了高级农业生产合作社的优越性。
    到今天上午止，有将近三分之一的代表小组已经结束了对“高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”的讨论。有少数代表小组已经讨论了全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。
