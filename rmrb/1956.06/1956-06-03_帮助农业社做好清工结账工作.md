To the Editors:

Doing a good job of evaluating work and recording points, and correctly calculating labor remuneration, is the basis for agricultural cooperatives to implement the principle of distribution according to work. However, at present, some agricultural cooperatives still have a tendency to emphasize financial accounts and de-emphasize work point accounts in their financial management, so that work point accounts cannot be cleared and announced to members for a long time, which is a major problem affecting the consolidation of the cooperative. According to the statistics of the county-wide accountant guidance meeting held by the Cooperation Department of the Wu County Party Committee on May 16: there are 747 cooperatives in the county, 652 of which have cleared financial accounts, accounting for more than 87% of the total number of cooperatives; while only 253 have cleared work point accounts, accounting for about 33.7% of the total number of cooperatives. In the cooperatives that have not cleared work point accounts, the members have great concerns and low labor efficiency. For example, in the seventh team of the Zhengliuqiao First Cooperative, because the work point accounts were not cleared and announced in time, the members were afraid of losing out if they worked too much. Since the beginning of spring, they only went to work after breakfast every day, and left work before sunset. They also had to take a nap at noon. Therefore, as the busy season is approaching, this team still has sixty acres of river mud to be accumulated, the water wheels and farm tools have not been repaired or oiled, and the irrigation channels have not been repaired.

Why are so many agricultural cooperatives in Wu County unable to clear work point accounts in time? There are many reasons. Some cooperatives have a poor foundation and chaotic production order; some cooperatives have too complicated evaluation and recording of work points, and the recorders' business ability cannot keep up; some cooperatives have not formulated labor production quotas and remuneration standards in time, so the teams have no basis for evaluation; some cooperatives have adjusted the cultivated areas, and the work points between teams have not been properly allocated, and so on. But the most fundamental reason is that in the previous period, there were problems in the accounting guidance work, focusing only on financial accounts and not on work point accounts, and abandoning leadership over clearing work and settling accounts. Therefore, there are many chaotic phenomena in the evaluation of work, such as the work points of the first team of the Mengcheng Third Cooperative are still recorded on cigarette cases, three production teams of the Zhulin Third Cooperative have no recorders, and the members record their own work, and many cooperatives still record "sun work." Under such circumstances, it is naturally difficult for the cooperative's work point accounts to be cleared in a short time.

The busy season of summer harvesting and planting has arrived, and agricultural cooperatives must also implement pre-distribution. All comrades engaged in accounting guidance work in rural areas must quickly find ways to help agricultural cooperatives clear work point accounts and announce them to members in time. Otherwise, it will inevitably affect the implementation of the principle of distribution according to work in the summer harvest pre-distribution work and the enthusiasm of members in summer harvesting and planting.

    帮助农业社做好清工结账工作编辑同志：
    做好评工记分工作，正确计算劳动报酬，是农业社实行按劳分配制度的依据。但是目前有些农业社在财务管理工作中还有着重财务账、轻工分账的偏向，以致工分账长期不能结清并向社员公布，这是影响社的巩固的一个重大问题。根据五月十六日中共武进县委合作部召开的全县会计辅导员会议上的统计材料：全县共有747个社，已结清财务账的有652个社，占总社数的87％以上；而已经结清工分账的只有253个社，占总社数的33.7％左右。在没有结清工分账的社里，社员顾虑很大，劳动效率很低。如郑六桥一社七队由于没有及时把工分账结清公布，社员怕多干活吃了亏，入春以来都是每天早饭后才上工，太阳不落就下工，中午还要睡个午觉。因此，快到大忙的时候了，这个队还有六十亩河泥未积好，水车、农具没修没油，灌溉水道也没有修理好。
    为什么武进县有这么多的农业社不能及时结清工分账呢？原因是很多的。有的社基础差，生产秩序混乱；有的社评工记分太复杂，记工员业务能力跟不上；有的社没有及时把劳动生产定额和报酬标准规定出来，队里评工没依据；有的社调整了耕作区，队与队之间的工分没有调拨好等等。但是最根本的原因，还是由于前一个时期，会计辅导工作上有问题，只抓财务账，不抓工分账，对清工结账放弃了领导。因此，评工中的混乱现象很多，如孟城三社一队工分还记在香烟壳子上，竹林三社有三个生产队没记工员，社员干活各人记各人的，有许多社还是记的“太阳工”。在这种情况下，社里的工分账自然一时很难结清。
    紧张的夏收夏种季节已经到来了，农业社也要实行预分了，所有在农村从事会计辅导工作的同志们，要迅速设法帮助农业社结清工分账，及时向社员公布。否则，势必影响到夏收预分工作中按劳分配原则的贯彻执行和社员在夏收夏种中劳动积极性的发挥。
