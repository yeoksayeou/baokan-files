    Eleven electric irrigation stations in the suburbs of Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, had been successively completed by May 25th. When the stations were test-running the water, the farmers raced along the embankments following the surging water, cheering and singing. These eleven electric irrigation stations are equipped with a total of twenty-seven electric motors and thirty-two water pumps, irrigating a total area of 39,017 mu of paddy fields. During the construction of the irrigation project, the farmers in the suburbs built a total of twenty main canals and more than five hundred branch canals, with a total length of approximately 570 li. Workers successively helped farmers complete nearly fifty culverts, twenty-two river crossings, 508 pairs of gate valves and other construction projects, and rushed to manufacture water pumps, repair motors, and install all the machinery and electrical equipment.
    According to the test results, thirty-two water pumps can irrigate more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields in twenty hours. If manual irrigation were used, it would require 20,000 farmers per day. The irrigation cost of manual water lifting is 8 to 10 yuan per mu, while electric irrigation only costs 4 yuan. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

    南通郊区建立十一个电力灌溉站
    江苏省南通市郊区十一个电力灌溉站，到五月二十五日止，已经先后建成。当各站进行试水的时候，农民沿堤赶着奔腾的流水，欢呼歌唱。这十一个电力灌溉站共装有二十七部电动机，三十二个水泵，全部灌溉面积为39，017亩稻田。在兴建灌溉工程中，郊区农民共筑了二十条干渠和五百多条分支渠，全长约570华里。工人们先后帮农民完成了近五十个涵洞，二十二个过河槽，508对门闸等建筑工程，并赶制了水泵，修理了马达，安装了全部机器和电气设备。
    根据试水情况，三十二部打水机在二十小时内能灌溉四万多亩稻田。如果用人工灌溉，每天就要有二万个农民。人工戽水的灌溉成本，每亩田需要八元至十元，电力灌溉只要四元就行了。　（本报驻南京记者）
