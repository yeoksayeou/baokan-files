The 1955 national financial statement demonstrates that our people have achieved many significant accomplishments in the third year of the First Five-Year Plan. The 1956 national budget marks our people's efforts with even greater enthusiasm in various undertakings, striving to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and surpass its goals. This budget is one for developing socialism and improving the people's living standards; it is a budget for peaceful construction. I fully endorse the "Report on the 1955 National Financial Statement and the 1956 National Budget" presented by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council, and I propose that this meeting approve the 1955 National Financial Statement and the 1956 National Budget, as well as the model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. We, the Christians of the entire nation, are elated that hundreds of millions of compatriots will forever be freed from poverty and embark on the road to happiness. We will certainly be with the people of the whole country, contributing all our strength to completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and surpassing its goals.

I am a Christian worker, and I would like to briefly talk about the recent development of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Chinese Christian Church and my personal views. (I)

Since the Second Session of the First National People's Congress nearly a year ago, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Chinese Christian Church has experienced more extensive and in-depth development. The patriotic consciousness of Christian workers and believers nationwide has also generally improved, and the work of the church in many areas has shown vigorous signs. Especially after the counter-revolutionary elements who, under the pretext of "religious belief," deliberately sabotaged the great unity of Christians against imperialism and for patriotism were exposed half a year ago, the great unity of Chinese Christianity has become more consolidated and expanded. In the past year, many Christian workers in twenty provinces across the country have engaged in regular study, and Beijing, Tianjin, Suzhou, and Nanjing have also promoted study among believers. Through study, the patriotic awareness of believers has greatly improved. When the enthusiasm for loving the country and loving the church are combined, a tremendous force emanates from them. They have enthusiastically devoted themselves to various central tasks such as flood prevention, drought resistance, medical services, road construction, literacy campaigns, patriotic health campaigns, and labor production, and many advanced model figures have emerged among them. This year, several Christians attended the National Conference of Advanced Workers and Advanced Producers. Last year, when Representatives Wu Yaozong, Deng Yuzhi, and I went to Shandong for inspection, we talked with several believers in Zhai Lou Village, Liaocheng. The village chief, who is also the head of the cooperative, is a Christian. He told us that he had been selected as a county-level labor model continuously from 1952 to 1954, and that all the believers in the village had joined the agricultural production cooperative.

In the past year, international tensions have eased to some extent, our country's socialist construction has achieved great successes, and the socialist transformation of our agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has achieved decisive victories. The broad masses of Chinese Christians have received extremely profound patriotic education in the movement of socialist transformation and socialist construction. They have not only seen the bright future of the motherland and themselves, but also the bright future of Chinese Christianity. At the Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Chinese Christian Church held in March this year, all members unanimously expressed their determination to unite more closely to realize the self-government, self-support, and self-propagation of the Chinese church, to participate in socialist construction, and to strive for the defense of world peace. After the meeting, widespread and in-depth communication was carried out throughout the country. Many believers could not help but express their gratitude and praise at the meeting, and more believers responded to the work calls put forward by the meeting with concrete actions of loving the country and loving the church. (II)

Through more than six years of personal experience since liberation, the vast majority of Chinese believers today have a relatively clear understanding of some basic issues. For example:

1.  We have personally experienced the joy of enjoying complete freedom of religious belief and the right to build the motherland together with the people of the whole country. We have seen the rapid progress of our country's socialist construction, the increasing improvement of social morality, and the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural lives. We recognize that the road of socialism is the road of abolishing man's exploitation of man, man's oppression of man, and man's hatred of man; it is the road to realizing friendship, equality, mutual assistance and cooperation between people. This is in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ that we believe in.

2.  We have seen that the Communist Party has consistently and faithfully implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, and we have seen the spirit of the Communist Party members serving the people and the noble qualities of honesty and love, so we cannot but eliminate prejudices or biases against people with different beliefs.

3.  We have seen the peaceful construction of the Chinese people and experienced the peaceful aspirations of the Chinese people. The responsibility of us Christians is precisely to strive to bear beautiful witness to the gospel of Christ's peace. Therefore, we must be with the good people of the world to oppose war and defend peace. Due to the changes in the international situation and the development of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Chinese Christian Church, the Chinese church and Chinese Christians can play a more active role in the movement to defend world peace. More and more foreign Christian figures are requesting to visit our country and our churches. Those who have already visited have a relatively correct understanding of the Chinese people's desire for peace, to varying degrees. (III)

Chinese Christianity has entered a new stage of construction. The facts of the past few years have also proved that the vast majority of Chinese Christians are patriotic, love their church, and love peace. However, the development of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement today still lags behind the development of the entire country and the international situation. Some unreasonable phenomena left over from the foreign missionary system in the Chinese church in the past still need to be eliminated; the residual influence of imperialism must continue to be eradicated; we must also actively realize the self-government, self-support, and self-propagation of the church. It must also be pointed out here that some people who have always been hostile to New China and hostile to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement have not yet learned from their failures. They either fabricate rumors and slander, saying that there is no freedom of religious belief in New China, or they attempt to sow discord, saying that different beliefs cannot coexist peacefully. Therefore, Christians across the country must always strengthen their vigilance, unite more closely with the people of the whole country, so that these rumor-mongers and instigators have no opportunity to use their tricks. Last year, when we inspected Shandong, a comrade from the Department of Culture and Education told me that he found that when Christians have a normal life and satisfaction in religion, they can more actively exert the effect of labor. However, I also experienced that when Christians have a normal development in the life of loving the country and loving mankind, they can also better reflect the spirit of religion. Therefore, I fully believe that relying on our own efforts and the support of the people of the whole country, we Chinese Christians will surely be able to overcome all difficulties in the process of advancement, and do our due work in our just cause of loving the country, loving the church, and loving peace.

    中国基督教三自爱国运动的发展情况
    ——陈见真代表的发言
    1955年的国家决算，表明我国人民在第一个五年计划的第三年里取得了许多重大的成就，1956年的国家预算又标志着我国人民以更大的热情在各项事业中努力迈进，争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划。这个预算是发展社会主义和提高人民生活水平的预算，是和平建设的预算。我完全拥护李先念副总理代表国务院所提出的“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，并建议这次会议通过1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算。并通过高级农业生产合作社示范章程和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。我们全国基督徒为亿万同胞将永远摆脱贫困，走上幸福的大道而欢欣鼓舞，我们必将和全国人民在一起，为提前和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划而贡献自己的一切力量。
    我是基督教的一个工作人员，我要向大家简单地谈一谈最近中国基督教三自爱国运动发展的情况和我个人的看法。（一）
    自第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议到现在将近一年了，在这个期间，中国基督教三自爱国运动有了更广泛、更深入的发展，全国基督教的工作人员和信徒的爱国主义觉悟也普遍地有了提高，教会许多方面的事工呈现了蓬勃的气象。尤其是半年前当个别借口“信仰问题”蓄意破坏基督徒反帝爱国大团结的反革命分子被揭发后，中国基督教的大团结更加巩固和扩大。在这一年来全国二十个省内有许多基督教工作人员都进行了经常性的学习，北京、天津、苏州、南京还推动了信徒学习。通过学习，信徒的爱国觉悟大大提高。当爱国与爱教的热情结合起来的时候，从他们身上发出了巨大的力量。他们踊跃地投入防汛、抗旱、医务、修路、扫盲、爱国卫生、劳动生产等各项中心工作，在他们中间涌现了不少先进模范人物。今年有好几位基督徒出席了全国先进工作者和先进生产者大会。去年当我与吴耀宗、邓裕志两位代表去山东视察时，我们和聊城翟楼村的几位信徒谈了话，该村的村长兼合作社社长是个基督徒，他从1952年到1954年连续被选为县的劳动模范，他告诉我们全村的信徒都参加了农业生产合作社。
    在这过去的一年内，国际紧张局势有了一定的缓和，我国的社会主义建设获得了伟大的成就，我国农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造都取得了决定性的胜利。广大的中国基督徒在社会主义改造和社会主义建设的运动中受到了极其深刻的爱国主义教育。他们不但看见了祖国和自己的光明远景，也看见了中国基督教的光明前途。在今年三月举行的中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会第二次全体委员会议上，全体委员一致表示决心，要更加紧密地团结起来为实现中国教会的自治、自养、自传，为参加社会主义建设和为保卫世界和平而努力。会后，在全国范围内举行了广泛而深入的传达，许多信徒在会场中止不住地发着感谢赞美的声音，更多的信徒则用爱国爱教的具体行动来响应会议所提出的工作号召。（二）
    通过解放后六年多的切身体验，今天广大的中国信徒在一些基本问题上已有了比较明确的认识。例如：
    1、我们亲身体验了享受完全的宗教信仰自由的快乐和与全国人民在一起建设祖国的权利。我们看见了我国社会主义建设事业的突飞猛进，社会道德的日益提高，人民的物质和文化生活的逐步改善。我们认识到社会主义的道路是废除人剥削人、人压迫人、人仇视人的道路；是实现人与人之间友爱平等、互助合作的道路。这是符合我们所信的耶稣基督的教训的。
    2、我们看见了共产党一贯忠诚地执行宗教信仰自由的政策，看见了共产党员为人民服务的精神和诚实爱人的高贵品格，就不能不消除对信仰不同的人们的成见或偏见。
    3、我们看见了中国人民的和平建设，体验了中国人民的和平愿望。我们基督徒的责任也正是要努力为基督的和平福音做美好的见证。因此，我们要和全世界的善良人民在一起，反对战争，保卫和平。由于国际形势的改变，由于中国基督教三自爱国运动的发展，中国教会和中国基督徒在保卫世界和平的运动中，可以起更积极的作用。越来越多的外国基督教人士要求访问我国和我国教会。已经来访问的对我国人民的和平意愿，在不同的程度上，有了比较正确的了解。（三）中国基督教已经进入一个新的建设的阶段。几年来的事实也证明了广大的中国基督徒是爱国爱教爱和平的。但是，今天三自爱国运动的发展仍然落后于整个国家和国际形势的发展。过去外国教会差会制度在中国教会里遗留下来的一些不合理的现象，仍待消除；帝国主义残余影响仍须继续肃清；我们还要积极地实现教会的自治、自养、自传。这里也必须指出，有些一向敌视新中国，敌视三自爱国运动的人们仍未从他们的失败中吸取教训。他们不是造谣诬蔑，说新中国没有宗教信仰自由，就是企图挑拨离间，说不同的信仰不能和平共处。因此，全国基督徒必须时刻加强警惕，更加紧密地和全国人民团结一致，使这些造谣挑拨的人们无所施其技。去年我们在山东视察的时候，有一位文教部的同志告诉我说：他发现了基督徒们在宗教上得到正常生活和满足时，就能更积极地发挥劳动的效力。但是，我也体验到基督徒们在爱国爱人类的生活上得到正常发展时，也就更能体现宗教的精神。因此我完全相信依赖我们自己的努力和全国人民的支持，我们中国基督徒一定能在前进中克服一切困难，并在我们爱国爱教爱和平的正义事业上，做好我们应做的工作。
