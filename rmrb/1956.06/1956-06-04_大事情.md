Big Event
By Li He and Hu Sisheng, our correspondents in the Soviet Union

These days, the weather in Moscow is sunny, and everywhere you can feel the youthful vitality brought by spring. Sensitive Muscovites have already put on light-colored clothing, and people's steps have become more cheerful and energetic. In this beautiful spring, a major event has attracted the attention of all Muscovites and all Soviet people: the prospect of a new development in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, two fraternal countries.

The May breeze in Moscow gently caresses the green leaves of the linden trees along the streets and the colorful headscarves and skirts of the women, and at the same time, it brings many attractive news items. On May 28th, the opening ceremony of the first Yugoslav Film Week in the Soviet Union, with the participation of a delegation of Yugoslav filmmakers, was held at the largest "Shock Worker" cinema in Moscow. Many eye-catching color posters appeared on the streets, telling people which cinemas were showing six Yugoslav feature films such as "The Chase" and "Decisive Minutes." The Muscovites’ great interest in Yugoslav films can be judged by the fact that more than one million viewers watched them in just four days. At the Gorky Art Theatre in Moscow, the theatre is packed with discerning audiences every night and resounds with applause of praise. The Yugoslav Drama Theatre is performing the deeply realistic Yugoslav classical comedy "Dundo Maroje" from more than four hundred years ago. In the exhibition hall of Gorky Culture and Leisure Park, the Yugoslav photo exhibition is also attracting a wide range of Moscow audiences. If you ask the female sales assistants at bookstores and street book stalls, books like Njegos's "The Mountain Wreath," Šenoa's "Peasant Uprising," and "Anthology of Yugoslav Folk Songs" have already sold out. And in recent days, Soviet newspapers have been publishing articles and dispatches about Yugoslavia's economic construction, films, the traditional friendship between the two peoples, and even Comrade Tito's biography. The "New Times" magazine has also published a special issue on Yugoslavia. All of this, to varying degrees, shows the great interest and sympathy of the Soviet people for the lives of the Yugoslav people.

In fact, this is also a heartfelt expression of the Soviet Union's great importance to the visit of President Tito and other Yugoslav state leaders. Soviet public opinion regards this visit as a continuation of the historic visit of Soviet leaders to Belgrade last year, and emphasizes that this visit will open a new stage of comprehensive cooperation and development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. There is a profound reason for this.

As everyone knows, Comrade Tito's visit to the Soviet Union coincided with the anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav Declaration last year. A year is not a long time, but people have seen that, in realizing the principles affirming guiding the relations between the two countries in the Soviet-Yugoslav Declaration, major results have been achieved through the joint efforts of the two countries, bringing extremely beneficial effects to the people of the two countries and to the cause of the international workers' movement and the maintenance of world peace.

Of great significance is that the two countries share the same position on many major current international issues. These issues include disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and the solution of the German problem on a peaceful and democratic basis. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia also share the same assessment of the situations in the Near East and Southeast Asia. It is now clear that this consistency plays an important role in easing international tensions and strengthening the cause of peace.

Over the past year, the development of economic and scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries has been very rapid, and at the same time, the progress of this relationship has largely reflected and promoted the consolidation and development of cooperation between the two countries. In this regard, it should be pointed out the role of the Economic Cooperation Agreement signed on September 1, 1955, in the great strides of comprehensive economic cooperation between the two countries. In terms of trade, the two countries agreed that the trade volume of each party would be 70 million US dollars in the next three years and strive to exceed this amount. The actual results showed that in the first quarter of 1956, the total value of Soviet exports to Yugoslavia reached 48 million rubles, thereby shifting the Soviet Union from eighth place in Yugoslav exports and fourteenth place in imports last year to fourth place this year. Therefore, the Yugoslav magazine "Economic Policy" wrote not long ago that the satisfactory development of trade relations between the two countries "on the one hand guarantees Yugoslavia the import of raw materials that are extremely important to our economy, and on the other hand guarantees a favorable market for many of our commodities, including those that are difficult to sell in the Western market due to fierce competition." On February 2 this year, an agreement was signed on Soviet loans and credits to Yugoslavia, stipulating that the Soviet Union would lend Yugoslavia free foreign exchange or gold worth 30 million US dollars and trade credits of 54 million US dollars. The scope of comprehensive economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is not limited to trade and loans. According to the agreement signed in January this year, the Soviet Union will help Yugoslavia build an ammonia fertilizer plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons of ammonia, a superphosphate plant with an annual output of 250,000 tons of superphosphate and 120,000 tons of sulfuric acid, and a power plant with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. After these enterprises are completed, they will play an important role in promoting the development of Yugoslav agriculture; and Soviet assistance to Yugoslavia in expanding three coal mines will help expand the quantity of Yugoslav exports. As for technical science, a wide range of cooperation plans has also been planned. In this regard, the Soviet Union will help Yugoslavia build an atomic reactor, and will provide Yugoslavia with the necessary equipment and nuclear fuel for this purpose. These vivid facts eloquently illustrate that the cooperative relationship between the two countries has been established on a very healthy foundation, a fact that is obvious to anyone with eyes.

President Tito recently said that nothing hinders the consolidation and development of cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The facts of the past year have also proven this. The exchange of delegations of various kinds, the multiple increase in the number of travelers, the distribution of works from the Selected Works of Lenin and Pravda to Pushkin, Sholokhov, and Mayakovsky in Yugoslavia, the expansion of the publication of Yugoslav books in the Soviet Union, and the cultural cooperation agreement recently signed in Moscow aimed at comprehensively developing cultural cooperation, are all symbols of the forward development of cultural cooperation between the two countries.

Now, President Tito's visit to the Soviet Union has officially begun. All peace-loving people and those who fear peace are watching this big event. (June 2nd)

    大事情
    本报驻苏联记者　李何　胡思升
    这些天来，莫斯科天气晴朗，到处都感觉到春天带来的青春的活力。敏感的莫斯科人，已穿上了浅色轻装，人们的步伐也迈得更加愉快和有力了。在这美好的春天里，一件大事引起所有莫斯科人和全体苏联人的注意，这就是苏联和南斯拉夫两个兄弟国家关系新的发展的前景。
    莫斯科五月的和风轻拂着街旁的菩提树的绿叶和妇女们彩色的头巾和裙边，同时也吹来了许多吸引人的消息。五月二十八日，在莫斯科最大的“突击队员”电影院，举行了有南斯拉夫电影工作者代表团参加的苏联第一次南斯拉夫电影周的开幕式。街头巷尾出现了许多触目的彩色海报，告诉人们像“追踪”“决定性的几分钟”等六部南斯拉夫故事片在什么电影院上演。莫斯科人对南斯拉夫电影的巨大兴趣可以从四天就有一百万以上的观众来判断。在莫斯科高尔基艺术剧院，每天晚上都挤满了有艺术鉴赏力的观众和响遍赞美的掌声。这是南斯拉夫话剧院在上演生活味深厚的四百多年前的南斯拉夫古典喜剧“杜多·马洛埃”。在高尔基文化休息公园的展览厅里，南斯拉夫的照片展览也不缺乏兴趣广泛的莫斯科观众，如果你去问问书店和街头书摊的女售货员，像尼柯施的“山地的皇冠”、谢诺阿的“农民起义”以及“南斯拉夫民歌选集”这类书籍已经销售一空了。而近日来，苏联的报刊连日登载着从南斯拉夫的经济建设、电影、两国人民的传统友谊一直到铁托同志的传略的文章和通讯，“新时代”杂志并出了南斯拉夫专辑。这一切，在不同的程度上都显示着苏联人民对南斯拉夫人民的生活怀抱着极大的兴趣和同情。
    实际上，这也是苏联十分重视铁托总统和南斯拉夫其他国家领导人的访问的衷心表示。苏联舆论把这次访问看成是去年苏联领导人访问贝尔格莱德的历史性事件的继续，并且强调这次访问将打开苏南两国全面合作和发展友好关系的新阶段。这是有着深刻理由的。
    大家知道，铁托同志访问苏联的日子，恰恰是去年苏南宣言签字的日子。一年的时间并不算太长，但是人们看到，在实现苏南宣言中肯定的指导两国关系的原则方面，经过两国的共同努力，已经获得了重大的结果，给两国人民和国际工人运动和维护世界和平的事业都带来了极有益的影响。
    具有重要意义的是，在许多当前重大的国际问题上两国抱有一样的立场。在这些问题中包括裁军和禁止原子武器，不同社会制度国家和平共处，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位和在和平民主的基础上解决德国问题。苏联和南斯拉夫对于近中东和东南亚局势的估价也是一致的。现在已经清楚地看到，这种一致对于缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平的事业，起着重要的作用。
    一年来，两国经济和科学技术合作关系的发展是十分迅速的，同时这种关系的进展在很大程度上也反映了并且促进了两个国家合作的巩固和发展。在这方面，应该指出1955年9月1日签订的经济合作协定。在两国全面经济合作的大踏步发展中的作用。在贸易方面，两国协议在今后三年中每方的贸易额为七千万美元，并且力争超额，而实际执行的结果，在1956年第一季度，苏联输往南斯拉夫的货物的总值就达四千八百万卢布，从而把苏联的位置从去年占南斯拉夫输出的第八位和输入的第十四位一跃到今年的第四位。因此，南斯拉夫“经济政策”杂志不久前写道，两国贸易关系的令人满意的发展对“南斯拉夫说来，一方面保证了我国经济极为重要的原料的输入，另一方面保证了我们许多商品、包括那些在西方市场由于猛烈的竞争很难销售的货物的有利的市场。”今年二月二日又签订了苏联给予南斯拉夫贷款和借款的协定，规定苏联贷与南斯拉夫价值三千万美元的自由外汇或黄金，并贷与南斯拉夫贸易信贷五千四百万美元。苏南两国全面经济合作的范围并不仅限于贸易和贷款方面，根据今年一月签订的协定，苏联将帮助南斯拉夫建设年产十万吨阿莫尼亚（氨）的氨肥工厂、年产二十五万吨过磷酸和十二万吨硫酸的过磷酸工厂以及发电能力为十万瓩的发电厂。这些企业建成以后，对于促进南斯拉夫农业的发展将起重要作用；而苏联帮助南斯拉夫扩建三个煤矿将有助于扩大南斯拉夫出口的数量。至于在技术科学方面也规划了广泛合作的计划，在这方面，苏联将帮助南斯拉夫建设一个原子反应堆，为此将给予南斯拉夫以必要的装备和核子燃料。这些生动的事实雄辩地说明了，两国的合作关系已经建立在十分健康的基础上，这是有眼睛的人都看到的事实了。
    铁托总统最近说过，没有任何东西阻碍着苏南两国文化合作关系的巩固和发展。一年来的事实证明也是如此。各种性质代表团的交换，旅行人数几倍地增加，从列宁选集、“真理报”一直到普希金、萧洛霍夫、马雅可夫斯基的作品在南斯拉夫的发行，南斯拉夫书籍在苏联出版的扩大，以及最近在莫斯科签订的旨在全面发展文化合作的文化合作议定书，都是两国文化合作关系向前发展的标帜。
    现在，铁托总统访问苏联日程正式开始了。全世界爱好和平的和害怕和平的人都在注视着这件大事情。（六月二日）
