Comprehensive water conservancy development has begun on many major rivers north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Six river basin survey teams composed of hundreds of water conservancy, wasteland survey, surveying, and socio-economic investigation personnel are conducting survey and planning work in the river basins of the Manas, Urumqi, Kaidu, Kongque, and Aksu Rivers.

The development plan for the Manas River basin, a nationally renowned high-yield cotton area, will be formulated soon. In this area, surveying and design have been carried out for many individual projects such as reservoirs, canals, and water diversion projects for the Karamay oil field, and some projects are already under construction. Upon completion of all projects, the cultivated area will be tripled compared to the existing one million mu.

In the Kaidu River basin in central Xinjiang, the survey of the river not flowing into Bosten Lake but directly into the Kongque River, as well as the socio-economic and mountainous reservoir surveys of the entire basin, were completed by the end of May. Survey personnel are also surveying seven million mu of arable land on the wasteland in the lower reaches of the Tarim River and the Kongque River.

Before the end of this year, river basin planning will be completed for the Manas River, Kaidu River (including the Kongque River), Urumqi River, and areas such as Hami and the Turpan Basin. In addition, the river basin surveys of the Aksu River, Weigan River, and other areas along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will also be completed ahead of schedule. By the end of 1957, the river basin planning of all major rivers in Xinjiang will be basically completed. (Xinhua News Agency)

The 30,000 mu of rice of the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been completely sown. So far, the spring plowing and production has come to an end. This spring, the total area sown and cultivated reached 1.73 million mu, an increase of more than 600,000 mu compared to last year.

At present, the 460,000 mu of winter wheat and spring wheat in the reclamation area farms are generally growing well after spring harrowing and are jointing. This year, the cotton planting area totaled 350,000 mu, an increase of 142% compared to last year, accounting for about 23% of the total cotton field area in Xinjiang. The cotton fields in the Manas River basin reclamation area, a famous cotton-producing area, have reached 200,000 mu. Now the cotton seedlings are growing sturdily, and the soldiers are stepping up various field management tasks. This year, the farms also expanded the planting of corn to 280,000 mu.

More than 1.15 million mu of the 1.7 million mu of farmland cultivated and sown by the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army this spring was cultivated by tractors.

This year, the efficiency of mechanized farming has generally improved, and many advanced tractor groups with a daily sowing of more than 1,000 mu have emerged. Generally, medium-sized locomotives also sow more than 700 mu per day, exceeding the quota by 10% to 15%.

    天山南北开始进行全面的水利开发
    新疆农业生产建设部队春播面积扩大到173万亩
    新疆维吾尔自治区天山南北的许多大河，都开始进行全面的水利开发。由几百名水利、荒地调查、测量和社会经济调查工作人员组成的六个流域查勘工作队，正在玛纳斯、乌鲁木齐、开都、孔雀和阿克苏等河流域进行查勘和规划工作。
    全国著名的棉花高产区玛纳斯河流域的开发规划，最近就将制定。在这个地区已经进行许多水库、水渠以及给克拉玛依油田引水工程等单位工程的勘测和设计，有些工程已正在施工。全部工程完工后，耕地面积就将比现有的一百万多亩增加三倍。
    新疆中部开都河流域在五月底已经完成了河流不流入博斯腾湖、直接注入孔雀河的查勘，以及全流域的社会经济、山区水库的调查。查勘工作人员们并且正在塔里木河和孔雀河下游的荒地上，勘测七百万亩可耕地。
    在今年年底以前，完成流域规划的将有玛纳斯河、开都河（包括孔雀河）、乌鲁木齐河和哈密、吐鲁番盆地等地区。此外，阿克苏河、渭干河及兰新铁路沿线其他地区的流域查勘，也将提前完成。到1957年底，新疆所有主要河流的流域规划将基本上完成。　（新华社）
    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队的三万亩水稻已经播种完毕。至此，春耕生产全部结束。今年春季播种和耕作面积共达到173万亩，比去年扩大了六十多万亩。
    目前各垦区农场的四十六万亩冬播小麦和春小麦，经过春耙后普遍生长良好，正在拔节。今年植棉面积共三十五万亩，比去年扩大了142％，约占新疆地区总棉田面积的23％多。著名产棉区玛纳斯河流域垦区的棉田已达到二十万亩。现在棉苗生长茁壮，战士们正在加紧进行各项田间管理工作。今年各农场还扩大种植玉米二十八万亩。　（据新华社讯）
    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队在今春耕作和播种的一百七十多万亩农田中，有115万多亩是用拖拉机耕作的。
    今年机耕效率普遍提高，并且涌现出不少日播一千亩以上的先进机车小组，一般的中型机车每天也播到七百亩以上，超过定额10％到15％。
