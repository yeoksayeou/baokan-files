    To Ensure Safe Navigation of Yangtze River Vessels During Flood Season
    Reinforcement of Navigation Marks Begins in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River
    (Our Dispatch) This year, the water level of the Yangtze River is rising rapidly, and in some areas, it has already reached the water level of the same period in 1954. The Hankou Navigation Engineering Area, under the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, has begun a comprehensive reinforcement of navigation marks for flood prevention on the Hankou-Yichang section of the waterway.
    In the past, during June and July, due to rising water levels, navigation marks in low-lying areas and sharp bends along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were often washed away by the waves and sediment brought by the flowing water. Shorelines were submerged, making it difficult for ships to identify channel boundaries at night, increasing the risk of accidents. To address this, work has begun to reinforce navigation marks in areas prone to flooding, densely installing grass-blocking piles near each shore mark. In sharp bend areas, such as the famous Hankinguan, Fanzui, Tianzi No. 1 Waterway, Shangchewan, and Huangjiaguai waterways, in addition to reinforcing shore marks, “ground cages” for installing buoys have also been buried in preparation for setting up buoys. Furthermore, a large number of flood markers have been added in certain special areas to ensure the safety of ship navigation.

    让长江大轮在汛季安全航行
    长江中游开始航标加固工作
    本报讯　今年长江水位上涨很快，有些地区已经达1954年同时期水位。长江航运管理局所属汉口航道工程区各航标段已经开始在汉宜段航道上，全面开始航标防洪加固工作。
    历年六、七月间，由于水位上涨，长江中游两岸低洼地区和急湾地带的航标，多被流水带来的浪沙冲倒。岸线被淹没，船舶夜间航行难以辨别航道界限，容易发生事故。为此，现在已经着手在容易被洪水淹没的地区，进行航标加固，在每一座岸标的附近密设了挡草桩；在急湾地区，如著名的汉金关、反咀、天字一号水道、上车湾、黄家拐等水道地区，除加固岸标外，还埋设了装置浮标用的“地笼”，以备设置浮标之用。此外，在个别特殊地区还增设了大量的泛滥标志，以保证船舶航行安全。
