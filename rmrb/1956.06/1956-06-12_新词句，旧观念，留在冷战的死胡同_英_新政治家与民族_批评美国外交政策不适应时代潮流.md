Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from London: An article in the June 2nd issue of the British weekly "New Statesman and Nation" stated that the remedies proposed by Eisenhower and Dulles in their recent speeches for the crisis currently facing Western policy were very "frivolous" and "unrealistic." Eisenhower and Dulles' speeches contained noble words and declarations of goodwill, "but reality does not match the words. Although Eisenhower and Dulles' talks seem to indicate that they have recognized the need for new policies, their basic policies remain essentially unchanged."

The article pointed out that Eisenhower "did not raise the question of whether the division of the world into several military blocs can or should be ended. On the contrary, he asked how this situation should be maintained under the new circumstances." Dulles even "suggested that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be 'further developed' to 'serve the needs of this generation and future generations.'"

The article believes that the President and Dulles seriously misunderstand the actual situation. "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, although costing a lot of money, has failed miserably, and it is increasingly unpopular in Europe." "When Dulles boasted that he would 'develop' this poor child of the Cold War (referring to NATO) into 'something complete,' he showed that although he used new words, he was still confined to his old misconceptions."

The article, titled "Failure by Neglect," continued: "Dulles has time to make many speeches, but he rarely has time to 'painfully reassess' his own assumptions. While he eloquently discussed the long-term future of the Western alliance, the Communist alliance quickly concentrated its resources on the 'peaceful competition.' While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council was 'studying' how to transform itself, the Communist countries were meeting in Berlin last week to comprehensively plan their economic plans. While a foreign affairs committee in Congress suggested shifting American military aid from European countries 'lagging behind' in rearmament to reliable allies Vietnam, Thailand, and Taiwan, the Soviet Union was shifting its factories and manpower to more productive uses. While Soviet diplomacy was exploiting nationalism and anti-colonialism, the United States was aligning itself with Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Ngo Dinh Diem, and America's allies were waging colonial wars in North Africa and Cyprus. While Stassen's research group produced materials from centuries of barren disarmament negotiations, the Soviet government was disbanding expensive, wasteful, and outdated troops."

The article continued: "Sometimes, American leaders seem to see the challenges they face. They have noted the rapid expansion of the Soviet economy, its ability to 'concentrate its funds, command its manpower, and train technicians more quickly and in greater numbers than any Western country.' But they avoid drawing the obvious conclusions... responding, like President Eisenhower, with the virtues of free enterprise as if it were a magic spell."

The article believes that the United States is currently stuck at the end of a Cold War dead end. The article emphasizes that "the West must quickly respond to the new challenges, or it will disintegrate under its divisive influence; at the same time, it must conduct free trade; there must be an economic expansion plan with a speed comparable to the current speed of Communist countries; colonialism must be eliminated quickly. If this can be done, peaceful competition can be carried out... So far, it is the Soviet Union that has seen the benefits of peaceful coexistence and has begun to effectively use these benefits to achieve communist goals. And the West is letting the opportunity slip away."

    新词句，旧观念，留在冷战的死胡同
    英“新政治家与民族”批评美国外交政策不适应时代潮流
    新华社11日讯  伦敦消息：六月二日出版的一期英国“新政治家与民族”周刊的一篇文章说，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在最近演说里为西方政策现在面临的危机提出的补救办法是很“轻浮”和“不实在的”。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的演说中有的是高贵的字眼和表示善意的声明，“但是现实同言语并不一致，虽然艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的谈话好像他们已认识到需要新的政策了，但是他们的基本政策实质上仍然未变。”
    这篇文章指出，艾森豪威尔“并没有提出这样问题：世界分裂为几个军事阵营的局面是否可以或者应该结束。相反的，他问道，在新的情况下应该怎样保持这种局面。”杜勒斯并且在“建议北大西洋公约组织应该‘进一步发展’以便‘为这一代和将来一代的需要服务’。”
    文章认为，总统和杜勒斯是严重地误解了实际情况。“北大西洋公约组织虽然费了很多钱，却失败得很惨，它在欧洲日益不受欢迎”。“在杜勒斯吹牛说要把冷战的这个可怜的孩子（指北大西洋公约）‘发展’为‘完备的东西’的时候，他就表明虽然他用了新的词句，但是他仍旧局限于他的旧错误观念。”
    这篇题目是“因玩忽而招致失败”的文章接着说：“杜勒斯有时间发表很多的演说，但是他很少时间‘忍痛地重新估计’他自己的臆断。当他精辟地讨论西方同盟的长期的将来的时候，共产党同盟却迅速地集中它的资源作‘和平竞赛’了。在北大西洋公约组织理事会要‘研究’怎样改造自己的时候，上星期共产党国家却在柏林开会全盘规划它们的经济计划。在国会一个外交委员会建议把给予在重新武装方面‘落后’的欧洲国家的美国军事援助移给可靠的盟国越南、泰国和台湾的时候，苏联却把它的工厂和人力转移到更有收获的用途上去。在苏联外交利用民族主义和反殖民主义的时候，美国却同李承晚、蒋介石和吴庭艳连成一气，而美国的盟国又在北非和塞浦路斯进行殖民战争。在史塔生的研究小组拿出经过几世纪的贫乏的裁军谈判研究材料的时候，苏联政府却解散了花钱、浪费、不合时代潮流的部队。”
    文章接着说：“有些时候，美国领袖们似乎看到了他们面临的挑战。他们注意到了苏联经济迅速扩大，它有能力‘集中它的资金，指挥它的人力，比任何西方国家更迅速、更大量地训练技术人员’。但是他们避免得出明显的结论。……就像艾森豪威尔总统一样以简直是魔术咒文一般的自由企业的优点作为答复”。
    文章认为，美国目前是留在一条冷战死胡同的尽头。文章强调说，“西方必须迅速应付新的挑战，否则就在它的分裂影响下分崩离析；同时还必须进行自由贸易；必须有一个速度可以同共产主义国家现在的速度相比的经济扩充计划；必须迅速消灭殖民主义。如果能这样的话，就能进行和平竞赛。……到目前为止，已经看到和平共处的好处并且开始有效地利用这些好处来达到共产主义的目的的是苏联。而西方正在让机会溜掉。”
