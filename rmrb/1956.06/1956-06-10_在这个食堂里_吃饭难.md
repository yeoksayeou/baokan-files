    In This Cafeteria, "Eating is Difficult"
    To the Editorial Comrades:
    We are staff members of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee directly affiliated organs. We want to report to you that the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee's Administrative Office is running the cafeteria very poorly.
    This cafeteria has established a set of extremely complicated rules, requiring people to "queue five times and bite once" to eat a meal. The so-called "five queues" mean queuing five times: queuing once to pre-order dishes the day before, queuing once to buy dishes the next day, queuing again to buy soup, and queuing twice to buy rice because you are only allowed to buy three cents worth of rice at a time, so most people have to queue twice. What is the "one bite"? Because the cafeteria stipulates that "meal tickets" must be checked when entering the dining hall, but buying dishes and soup takes place outside the dining hall. Therefore, when people enter the dining hall, they have to hold dishes in one hand and soup in the other, so there is no way to hold the "meal ticket" and they have to bite it. Not only that, but to carry soup and dishes into the dining hall, people have to pass through six queues, three doors, and a fifty-meter-long corridor. If one is careless, accidents such as spilling dishes and scalding people can occur.
    The cafeteria also implements the dish ordering system mechanically. The cafeteria stipulates that the ordering time is before and after lunch the previous day. If someone is away on official business and does not return during this time, they will not be able to eat the next day; if someone orders a dish one day and then cannot eat on time the next day due to an event, they are not allowed to cancel the order.
    In addition, the quality of the food in the cafeteria is low, and the price is high. According to the statement of income and expenditure of the food in the administrative office, at the end of October 1955, the actual stock of materials in the kitchen was 660 yuan, but by March of this year, it had increased to 2,000 yuan. These are all profits earned from the food. We really don't know what the cafeteria is doing with the profits it saves.
    Over the past two years, we don't know how many suggestions have been made about the cafeteria's work. But until now, the cafeteria's work has not improved. People can only shake their heads and sigh: "Eating is difficult in this cafeteria!"

### 在这个食堂里“吃饭难”

专栏：

    在这个食堂里“吃饭难”编辑同志：
    我们是江苏省人民委员会直属机关的工作人员。我们要向你们反映：江苏省人民委员会机关行政处把食堂办得太坏了。
    这个食堂规定了一套繁琐之至的制度，人们吃一顿饭要“五排一咬”。所谓“五排”，就是排五次队：先一天预订菜排一次队，第二天买菜排一次队，买汤又排一次队，买饭一次最多只准买三分钱的，因此一般人都要排两次队。所谓“一咬”又是什么呢？因为食堂规定进饭厅的时候要检查“就膳证”，而买菜、买汤都在饭厅外面。因此，人们进饭厅的时候，一手端菜、一手端汤，“就膳证”没有办法拿，只好咬在嘴里。不仅如此，人们要端着汤和菜进饭厅，还得穿过六个队伍、三道门和一个长五十公尺的走廊，如果稍一疏忽，就会发生打翻菜、烫伤人的事故。
    这个食堂执行订菜制度也很机械。食堂规定订菜时间是前一天午饭的前后，假若有人因公出外，没有在这个时间里赶回来，第二天就吃不上饭；第一天订了菜以后，第二天如果因事不能按时吃饭，也根本不许退订。
    另外，食堂里菜的质量低，价钱高。从事务室伙食收支对照表来看，1955年10月底，厨房实存物资是六百六十元，而到今年三月就增加为两千元了。这些都是从饭菜里挣来的利润。我们真不知道，食堂挣了利润存下来做什么用。
    两年来，对食堂工作提出的意见不知有多多少少了。但是直到如今，食堂工作仍然没有什么改进。人们只好摇头叹息：“在这个食堂里吃饭难！”
