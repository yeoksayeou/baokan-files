Xinhua News Agency, June 15th: Registration for the national unified college entrance examination will generally begin on the 20th in all examination districts. To allow this year's high school graduates to properly complete their secondary studies, registration for high school graduates is scheduled to begin on July 1st. Cadres currently employed, demobilized construction soldiers, transferred soldiers, unemployed knowledge youth, and other candidates preparing to take the college entrance examination are generally scheduled to register from June 20th until the end of the month. Overseas Chinese students can register as long as they return to China before the examination period.

To accommodate candidates, in addition to the originally designated examination districts, many more examination districts have been added in various regions, and registration points and examination halls have been set up in remote and inaccessible areas to accept registrations and organize examinations.

According to Xinhua News Agency, over 700 secondary specialized schools nationwide (excluding secondary normal schools) plan to enroll over 310,000 new students this year, more than two and a half times the number of students enrolled last year.

These secondary specialized schools, which train intermediate specialized personnel in over 200 fields for the country, will enroll young people who have graduated from junior high school or have equivalent educational levels. Industrial secondary specialized schools have a study duration of three to four years; agriculture, forestry, medicine, and other schools are three years; and finance and economics schools are two and a half to three years.

During enrollment, secondary specialized schools prioritize the admission of children of workers and peasants, revolutionary working cadres, industrial workers, young farmers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers.

To fulfill this year's enrollment targets for secondary specialized schools, the Higher Education Ministry requires all regions to expand student sources, mobilize past junior high school graduates to apply, and requests factories, mines, enterprises, and organizations to actively support young employees with junior high school education levels within their units to apply.

The Higher Education Ministry also requires education administrative departments at all levels to pay attention to students' preferences during unified enrollment and admission and to prevent forced assignment practices.

According to Xinhua News Agency, over 200 newly established secondary specialized schools nationwide will begin enrollment this summer.

Among the newly established secondary specialized schools, over 90 are industrial in nature. There has been significant development in agricultural and health-related secondary specialized schools this year. Finance, law, physical education, culture, and other types of secondary specialized schools have also increased by 20 this year.
