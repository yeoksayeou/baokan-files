Saving Wood, Steel, and Cement
Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant Construction Site Adopts Forty-Two Advanced Experiences

(Our report) The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant construction site has adopted forty-two advanced experiences in conservation in the past month, greatly saving building materials such as wood, steel, and cement, and significantly reducing project costs. After promoting the advanced experience of using bamboo templates instead of wooden templates, 1,350 cubic meters of wood have been saved in projects such as the technical school and factory model warehouse, reducing costs by more than 5,900 yuan. In terms of saving steel, the advanced experience of cold-drawn steel alone has saved 22 tons of steel. In the fourth batch of dormitory floor slabs and heating pipeline cover plate projects, advanced experience in bamboo-reinforced concrete is planned to be adopted, which is estimated to save 172 tons of steel. In terms of saving cement, the universal adoption of cement mortar mixed with clay slurry for wall construction has saved approximately 22 tons of cement.

    武汉重型工具机厂工地采用了四十二种先进经验
    本报讯　武汉重型工具机厂工地一个多月来采用了四十二种节约方面的先进经验，大大节约了木材、钢筋、水泥等建筑材料，工程成本降低了很多。推广竹模板代替木模板的先进经验以后，在技工学校和厂房模型仓库等工程上，就节省了一千三百五十立方木材，并且降低成本五千九百多元。在节约钢筋方面，仅推广冷拉钢筋先进经验一项，就节约钢材二十二吨。在第四批宿舍楼板和热力管道的盖板工程上，准备采用竹筋混凝土先进经验，据计算可以节约钢筋172吨。在节约水泥方面，普遍采用了水泥砂浆掺加粘土浆砌墙，节约水泥约二十二吨。
