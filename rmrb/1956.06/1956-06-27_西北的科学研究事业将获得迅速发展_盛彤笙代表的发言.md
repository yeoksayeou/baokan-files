I completely agree with the reports and explanations made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Minister Liao Luyan, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen at the conference.

I am a scientific worker from the Northwest region and am currently responsible for preparing for the establishment of the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Recently, I was honored to participate in the national science planning work, which was very educational and made me feel very excited.

Science in old China had a strong colonial character. The research institutes taken over by the Chinese Academy of Sciences were mostly distributed in coastal cities. There was not a single research institute in the vast area west of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, only a few small work stations. In 1954, the Chinese Academy of Sciences decided to establish the Northwest Branch, and in 1955, it first established the Northwest Institute of Agricultural Biology in Shaanxi, with soil and water conservation as its main task. This year, several research institutions will also be established in Lanzhou, which will begin to change the unreasonable distribution of scientific institutions in old China. It can be expected that after this scientific plan, scientific research in the Northwest will surely achieve more rapid development.

In the past year or so, in addition to preparing for the establishment of some research institutions, the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has also carried out some organizational work for scientific research in the Northwest region, such as providing assistance in various forms to teachers in Northwest universities and individual members of society who have difficulties in scientific research. This year, two comprehensive expedition teams, the Qinling Mountains and the Hexi Corridor, were organized, with more than 100 scientific workers from universities and professional departments participating. They will conduct some investigations and surveys on the natural conditions of the Qinling Mountains and the agricultural conditions of the Shule River basin in the Hexi Corridor. This will provide some preliminary scientific basis for the comprehensive development of these two regions, and will also allow us to accumulate some preliminary experience in organizing scientific work and exploring local scientific potential.

However, the scientific foundation in the Northwest region is still very weak, and the number of scientific workers is very small. Although the number has increased slightly in the past few years, most of them are intermediate and junior personnel. There is still a great lack of senior scientists who can lead research work. Although we also welcome intermediate and junior personnel, what we urgently need are senior research personnel, because the economic construction of the Northwest region has just begun, and there are many new and complex problems that require scientists with a high level of expertise to study and solve. Other countries always send their best scientists first when developing their remote areas. Therefore, on this issue, we especially hope for the support of advanced regions and the overall coordination within the country. Of course, when transferring senior scientists to the interior, the principle should be to avoid excessively affecting the original foundation of coastal research institutions.

Another relatively prominent difficulty in our work is the difficulty in infrastructure construction. Buildings used for scientific research have many high and special requirements, but the engineering departments seem to understand this very little, resulting in extremely poor quality of our capital construction last year. Other academic institutions in the Northwest region have similar situations.

Based on our experience, before any construction project starts, in addition to obtaining the approval of the urban construction authorities for the number of floors and the location of the building, it must also pass through the design company, the construction company, and the Construction Bank. These units show an even deeper understanding of the policy of streamlining and saving. Some facilities that we believe are essential for scientific research institutions after much consideration, the design company still refuses to design. After finally requesting and obtaining the design company's consent to design part of them, the construction company refuses to construct according to the design. After spending a lot of time persuading the construction company to agree to construct, the Construction Bank refuses to allocate funds. We, the client, are nominally the owner, but in reality, we "own but cannot control." As a result of such layer-by-layer reductions, the research building we built last year is almost indistinguishable from a warehouse. The quality of the researchers' dormitories is even worse. Pouring a basin of water on the third floor can leak through the second floor to the first floor. If tangible water cannot be blocked, then intangible sound certainly cannot be blocked. After the central government called for marching towards science, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee and the Lanzhou Municipal Party Committee recently attached importance to and inspected this situation, and have instructed the engineering company to rework and remedy the situation. The additional budget for this will exceed the funds saved last year by reducing these facilities, and the loss caused by the delay in research work cannot be calculated in terms of money. Based on the above situation, we sincerely hope that the engineering departments will pay more attention to the characteristics of academic institutions in the future, especially to assist our inland academic institutions in creating better working and living conditions, in order to welcome scientists from advanced regions to come to the interior to carry out scientific research work.

The Northwest region is vast and rich in above-ground and underground resources. Industry, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry have extremely broad development prospects and are important bases for the country's economic construction. There are many large mountains in the Northwest region that need to be explored and developed, many large rivers that need to be comprehensively planned and utilized, vast deserts and Gobi deserts that need to be conquered and transformed, and many virgin lands that have not been visited that need to be investigated and explored by scientists. In addition, the Northwest region has a large number of historical relics from past dynasties available for archaeological excavation, and there are many folk customs, histories, and languages ​​of fraternal ethnic groups that need to be investigated and studied. It can be seen that the Northwest region, whether in natural science, technical science, or social science, has very rich research materials, and scientists have an extremely broad world to display their talents. In particular, the railway connecting Xinjiang and the Soviet Union will soon be completed, and the Northwest region will have more favorable conditions for international cultural exchanges and scientific and technological cooperation, which will be conducive to the progress of research work. Therefore, we earnestly hope that scientists from all over the country can actively come to the Northwest to conduct research and engage in inspections, and jointly build this vast region into a prosperous and beautiful back garden of the motherland. Among the deputies to the National People's Congress, there are more than 200 outstanding scientists of various professions. The deputies go out for inspections twice a year. We warmly welcome all deputies to come to the Northwest to inspect and guide scientific research work, which will definitely play a great role in promoting the development of scientific research in the interior. We believe that under the close care and attention of the Party and the government, and with the strong support of the people and the scientific community across the country, the scientific cause in the Northwest will surely be able to follow closely behind the advanced regions and gradually catch up with the advanced levels of the world.

### 西北的科学研究事业将获得迅速发展——盛彤笙代表的发言

    西北的科学研究事业将获得迅速发展
    ——盛彤笙代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、廖鲁言部长和彭真副委员长在大会上所作的报告和说明。
    我是西北地区的一个科学工作者，现在担负着筹备中国科学院西北分院的任务，最近又荣幸地参加了全国科学规划工作，受到了很大的教育，感觉非常兴奋。
    旧中国科学事业带有浓厚的殖民地色彩，中国科学院接收的研究所大都分布在沿海的城市，在京汉路和粤汉路以西的广大地区没有一个研究所，只有几个很小的工作站。1954年中国科学院决定筹建西北分院，并于1955年首先在陕西筹设了以研究水土保持为主要任务的西北农业生物研究所，今年还要在兰州建立几个研究机构，这样才开始改变了旧中国科学机构分布不合理的现象。可以预期，在这一次科学规划以后，西北的科学研究事业必将会获得更迅速的发展。
    过去一年多以来，中国科学院西北分院筹备委员会除筹建了一些研究机构以外，还对西北地区的科学研究事业进行了一些组织工作，例如对于西北地区高等学校教师和个别社会人士在科学研究上的一些困难，作了各种不同形式的协助。今年又组织了秦岭和河西两个综合考察队，有高等学校和业务部门的科学工作者一百余人参加，对于秦岭的自然情况和河西走廊疏勒河流域的农业条件将作一些调查和勘察，对于这两个地区的综合开发将可提供一些初步的科学依据，同时也将使我们在组织科学工作和发掘地方科学潜力方面积累一些初步的经验。
    但是，西北地区的科学基础究竟是很弱的，科学工作者的人数是很少的，过去几年中，人数虽然略有增加，但多是中级和初级人材，能够领导研究工作的高级科学家仍然极感缺乏。我们对于中级和初级人材虽然也同样欢迎，但更迫切需要的是高级研究人材，因为西北地区的经济建设方才开始，存在着许多性质复杂的新问题，需要有着高度水平的科学家来研究解决。别的国家在开发她们的边远地区的时候也总是首先派出她们最优秀的科学家的。因此在这个问题上我们特别希望各先进地区的支援和全国范围内的统筹调剂。当然，在向内地调配高级科学家的时候，也要以不过分影响沿海研究机构的原有基础为原则。
    我们工作中的另一个比较突出的困难是基建方面的困难。供作科学研究的建筑物有着许多较高的特殊要求，但工程部门对于这些似乎了解得非常不够，致使我们去年的基本建设质量极其低劣。西北地区其他学术机关也有类似情况。
    根据我们的经验，在任何建筑工程兴工以前，除要在建筑物的层数和建筑位置上首先取得城市建设当局的批准之外，还要经过设计公司、建筑公司和建设银行三道关口。对于精简节约的政策，这些单位表现得一家比一家体会更为深刻。有一些我们经过多方考虑认为是科学研究机构实在不可缺少的设施，设计公司仍然不肯设计进去。好容易要求得到设计公司的同意将其中一部分设计进去了，建筑公司却不肯按照施工。再费许多口舌说服了建筑公司同意施工以后，建设银行又不同意拨款。我们甲方名为业主，实际上是“业不由主”。经过这样层层削减的结果，我们去年修建的研究大楼就和一座仓库相差无几。至于研究人员的宿舍的质量则更坏，在三层楼的地上泼一盆水，可以透过二楼漏到一楼。有形的水尚且隔不住，无形的音当然更隔不住了。在中央号召向科学进军以后，甘肃省委和兰州市委最近已经重视和检查了这种情况，并已指示工程公司返工补救，为此追加的预算，要比去年因减去这些设施而节约的经费超过很多，至于研究工作因而延迟不能进行所造成的损失则更非金钱所能计算的了。根据以上情况，我们诚恳地希望工程部门今后要对学术机关的特点多加照顾，特别是要协助我们内地的学术机关创造较好的工作和生活条件，以便迎接先进地区的科学家到内地来进行科学研究工作。
    西北地区辽阔，蕴藏着丰富的地上和地下资源，工业和农林畜牧业都有着极其广阔的发展前途，是祖国经济建设的重要基地。西北地区有着许多大山须待勘探和开发，许多大河须待综合规划和利用，有着广大的沙漠戈壁须待征服和改造，许多人迹未到的处女地须待科学家去考察和探险。此外，西北地区还有着大量的历代文物可供考古发掘，有着许多兄弟民族的民俗历史和语言文字须待调查研究。由此可见，西北地区无论在自然科学、技术科学或社会科学方面，研究材料都是非常丰富的，科学家有着极其广阔的天地来施展他们的才能。特别是通过新疆联接苏联的铁路不久即可修通，西北地区在国际文化交流和科学技术合作方面更将有着优越的条件，有利于研究工作的进行。因此我们殷切盼望各地科学家能够踊跃到西北来进行研究和从事考察，共同将这块广大的地区建设成为祖国繁荣美丽的后花园。在全国人民代表大会代表中有着200余位各项专业的优秀的科学家，代表们每年要出外视察两次，我们热烈欢迎各位代表能来西北视察和指导科学研究工作，这对于内地科学研究事业的发展一定会起到极大的推动作用。我们相信，在党和政府的密切关怀和重视之下，在全国人民和科学界的大力支援之下，西北的科学事业也一定能够紧跟在各先进地区之后，逐渐赶上世界的先进水平。
