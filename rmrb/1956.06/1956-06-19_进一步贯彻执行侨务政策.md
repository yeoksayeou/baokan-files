Further Implement the Overseas Chinese Affairs Policy

    The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission recently held its Fourth Expanded Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference, reviewing the overseas Chinese affairs work. In light of the current easing international situation and the rapid development of domestic socialist construction, and based on the ardent desire of overseas Chinese for the motherland, the conference focused on discussing further implementation of various overseas Chinese affairs policies, developing production in overseas Chinese hometowns, and continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese. The convening of the conference once again demonstrates the motherland's deep concern for overseas Chinese abroad and overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese at home.

    Thanks to the active leadership and strong support of local Party and government leading organs and relevant departments, domestic overseas Chinese affairs work has achieved results. In the high tide of the great socialist construction and socialist transformation, over 90% of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese have joined cooperatives, and 50% have transferred to advanced cooperatives. The vast majority of overseas Chinese relatives have made great progress, gloriously participating in labor production, and some have even become labor models and advanced producers. The vast majority of returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have accepted socialist transformation. In terms of overseas Chinese investment, Guangdong and Fujian have established overseas Chinese investment companies, and overseas Chinese investment has built two or thirty factories and other enterprises that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Many overseas Chinese have utilized their expertise in growing tropical crops, and the rubber they grow is better than that of some state-owned farms, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in participating in the construction of the motherland. Over the past two years, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces have paid more attention to overseas Chinese affairs work, and have successively held several representative conferences of overseas Chinese relatives. The Central People's Government has also taken resolute measures to protect overseas Chinese remittances, resettle returned overseas Chinese, and ensure the supply of grain and materials. In the past six months, various overseas Chinese hometowns have begun to thoroughly implement the overseas Chinese affairs policy. In areas where the policy is implemented well, overseas Chinese and their relatives have expressed satisfaction, and the construction of the local economy and culture and education has also taken a step forward, creating a new situation in the overseas Chinese hometowns.

    However, there are still many shortcomings and errors in the implementation of domestic overseas Chinese affairs policies in various places. The main shortcoming is that timely and effective measures have not been taken to actively resolve the new contradictions and problems that have arisen in the socialist high tide. For example, in terms of labor production, no distinction has been made between the different circumstances of overseas Chinese relatives, and they have not been assigned labor that is within their capabilities. Or, they have not been organized to participate in labor according to their specialties, thus failing to stimulate their enthusiasm for labor. Insufficient care has also been given to the small number of widowed, orphaned, lonely, elderly, weak, sick, and disabled overseas Chinese relatives who lack labor power. In terms of material supply, supplies have not been provided according to the living habits and special requirements of overseas Chinese relatives, causing some overseas Chinese relatives to experience completely unnecessary difficulties in their lives. In terms of protecting overseas Chinese remittances, some places one-sidedly emphasize investing remittances in production, indirectly interfering with the right to use remittances, causing overseas Chinese relatives to have unnecessary concerns when receiving remittances from abroad. In terms of resettling returned overseas Chinese senior intellectuals, some people with technical expertise have not been assigned jobs according to their specialties, resulting in the use of skills that are not what they studied. Those who have returned to the country and are unfamiliar with the place and have real difficulties have not been enthusiastically helped, but rather are considered troublesome, and so on.

    The conference unfolded sharp criticism and self-criticism of the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors. Extensive and in-depth discussions were held on how to implement the overseas Chinese affairs policy in the future, and many overseas Chinese affairs policies have become clearer and more specific than in the past. However, to further improve overseas Chinese affairs work and implement the overseas Chinese affairs policy, it is still necessary to clarify the following issues ideologically:

    Recognize the characteristics of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese families are divided into two parts, with the main labor force abroad and family members remaining in the country. There are 10 million overseas Chinese relatives in the country, most of whom are family members of overseas Chinese laborers, living in rural areas, and they have close ties with overseas Chinese abroad. Remittances are their main or secondary source of livelihood. This characteristic of overseas Chinese and their relatives must be carefully taken care of. Otherwise, every major social reform movement will always encroach on remittances, causing some tremors among overseas Chinese or their relatives. People in many countries learn about our country through overseas Chinese. The experience of the past few years has proven that even a slight mishandling of the problem of domestic overseas Chinese relatives will immediately affect overseas Chinese abroad, and may even affect the impressions of our country among the people of the countries where they reside. Therefore, it is necessary to act in accordance with policies and handle the problems of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese well, even the smallest problems. If handled properly, it will expand our country's influence. If handled improperly, it will affect the peace of mind of overseas Chinese relatives in their rural homes, which would be very bad.

    Only by taking care of the characteristics of returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese relatives can we give play to their enthusiasm and creativity. In order to cultivate and give play to the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, the state has formulated various overseas Chinese affairs policies based on their characteristics, with the aim of guiding them to embark on socialism together with the people of the whole country, and not at all to make them special, thereby affecting their socialist enthusiasm.

    The facts of the past few years have proven that the vast majority of the more than 200,000 returned overseas Chinese are good. Imperialist agents may take advantage of the opportunity of overseas Chinese returning to the country to disguise themselves as overseas Chinese and mix in; but we must affirm that the vast majority of returned overseas Chinese are patriotic. As overseas Chinese abroad increasingly unite around the motherland, reactionaries have become isolated. We must distinguish between the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese and the very few disguised overseas Chinese spies; we must rely on the vast number of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese masses and give play to their enthusiasm in order to expose the small number of disguised overseas Chinese enemies. Now, in some places, due to a lack of understanding of overseas Chinese, there are unnecessary precautions against returned overseas Chinese, and inquiries about remittances in many ways have a very bad impact on overseas Chinese abroad. The reason for these phenomena may be due to a lack of understanding of the overseas Chinese situation, but it must be resolutely corrected.

    Overseas Chinese relatives, returned overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students, they either have relatives far abroad, or they are unfamiliar with the place and local customs after returning to the country, or they are not accustomed to domestic life when they first return to the country. We must always care about their lives and hardships, and at the same time, proceeding from the specific situation, patiently and meticulously guide them and help them. Any crude, impatient, subjective, and policy-violating style will turn good things into bad things.

    In overseas Chinese hometowns with a large population of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese affairs work must be closely coordinated with the central work. To do a good job in the work of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, implement the overseas Chinese affairs policy well, and give play to the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, it is necessary to do a good job in the central work. Because overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese have their special circumstances in terms of economy and living habits, therefore, in terms of the methods and steps for carrying out and completing the central work, overseas Chinese hometowns and general areas should also adapt to local conditions and be different. Overseas Chinese affairs work is a part of the central work, and it itself serves the central work; overseas Chinese affairs work must strive to complete the general central work, and at the same time, the central work must also consider the appropriate position of overseas Chinese affairs work when making deployments and arrangements, and understand that in special areas like overseas Chinese hometowns, the central task cannot be completed without doing a good job in overseas Chinese affairs work. In places with a small number of returned overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese relatives, and overseas Chinese students, as well as relevant units and schools, the implementation of the state's overseas Chinese affairs policy should also be included in the work plan and given due attention.

    After in-depth discussions at the conference, the overseas Chinese affairs policy is clearer and more specific. Now, the question is how to further implement it. The local Party committees in overseas Chinese hometowns must attach importance to overseas Chinese affairs work, conscientiously convey and discuss the domestic overseas Chinese affairs policy, arrange work according to the characteristics of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese, conduct regular in-depth inspections, discover new situations and problems in a timely manner, and quickly and actively resolve them. Local overseas Chinese affairs departments must improve their own organizations, attach importance to the work of the Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, and be good at seeking the support and assistance of various relevant departments in order to further implement the overseas Chinese affairs policy and carry out overseas Chinese affairs work.

### 进一步贯彻执行侨务政策

    进一步贯彻执行侨务政策
    华侨事务委员会最近举行了第四次侨务扩大会议，检查了侨务工作。会议就目前日趋缓和的国际形势和国内社会主义建设飞速发展的情况，根据海外华侨向往祖国的热烈要求，着重讨论了进一步地贯彻各项侨务政策，发展侨乡生产，不断地提高侨眷、归侨的物质生活和文化生活水平等问题。会议的召开又一次地说明了祖国对国外侨胞和国内侨眷、归侨的深切关怀。
    由于各地党政领导机关和有关部门积极领导和大力支持，国内侨务工作是有成绩的。在伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的高潮中，侨眷、归侨90％以上参加了合作社，50％转入了高级社。绝大多数侨眷有很大进步，光荣地参加劳动生产，有的还当了劳动模范和先进生产者。绝大部分归侨中的工商业者接受了社会主义改造。在华侨投资方面，广东、福建都成立了华侨投资公司，华侨投资兴建的有二、三十个工厂和其他有利于国计民生的企业。许多华侨发挥了种植热带作物的特长，他们种植的橡胶比某些国营农场的都好，充分地表现了华侨参加祖国建设的热情。两年来，广东、福建等省更加重视侨务工作，先后开过几次侨眷代表会议。中央人民政府在保护侨汇、安置归侨以及在粮食和物资供应等问题上，也采取了坚决措施。半年来，各地侨乡开始深入地贯彻了侨务政策，贯彻执行得好的地区，华侨、侨眷表示满意，当地经济和文化教育的建设也推进了一步，使侨乡出现了一个新的局面。
    但是，各地在贯彻执行国内侨务政策中，还有许多缺点和错误。主要的缺点是：对社会主义高潮所发生的新矛盾和新问题未能及时采取有力措施，主动地加以解决。例如在劳动生产方面，没有区别侨眷的不同情况，分配他们力所能及的劳动。或者没有根据他们的特长组织他们参加劳动，因此，不能发挥他们的劳动积极性。对于少数鳏、寡、孤、独、老、弱、病、残缺乏劳动力的侨眷也照顾不够。在物资供应方面，没有根据侨眷的生活习惯和特殊要求予以供应，使有些侨眷生活遭到完全不必要的困难。在保护侨汇方面，有的地方片面地强调将侨汇投入生产，变相地干涉侨汇的使用权，使侨眷接受国外侨汇时产生不必要的顾虑。在安置归侨高级知识分子方面，对一些有技术专长的，未能根据他们的专长分配工作，致使所用非所学。对回国后人地生疏确有困难的，没有热情地加以帮助，反而嫌麻烦等等。
    对上述的缺点和错误，会议展开了尖锐的批评和自我批评。对今后如何贯彻侨务政策，进行了广泛深入的讨论，许多侨务政策比过去更加明确，更加具体了。但要进一步做好侨务工作，贯彻侨务政策，还必须从思想上明确以下问题：
    认清侨眷和归侨的特点。华侨的家庭分作两部分，主要劳动力在国外，家属留在国内。国内侨眷一千万，大多数是国外华侨劳动人民的家属，居住在农村，他们和国外华侨有密切的联系，侨汇是他们主要或次要的生活依靠。对于华侨和侨眷的这一特点，必须予以周密的照顾，否则，每次较大的社会改革运动总要侵犯到侨汇，在华侨或侨眷当中发生一些震动。许多国家的人民是通过华侨了解我国情况的。几年来的经验证明：对国内侨眷问题稍有一点处理不当，就立刻会影响到国外华侨，甚至会影响到侨居国人民对我国的观感。因此，必须按政策办事，处理好侨眷和归侨的问题，那怕是最小的问题。如果处理得当，那就扩大了我国的影响。如果处理不当，影响到侨眷不安心于乡居，那就很不好。
    照顾归侨和侨眷的特点，才能发挥侨眷、归侨的积极性和创造性。国家为着培养和发挥侨眷、归侨的积极性，根据侨眷、归侨特点制定了各项侨务政策，目的是为了引导他们和全国人民一道走上社会主义，完全不是为着把他们特殊化，从而影响他们的社会主义积极性。
    几年来的事实证明，二十多万的归侨，绝大部分都是好的。帝国主义特务分子可能利用华侨回国的机会，伪装华侨混进来；但是我们必须肯定，归国华侨的绝大部分是爱国的。随着国外华侨的日益团结在祖国周围，反动分子已处于孤立地位。我们必须区别广大爱国华侨和非常少数的伪装华侨的特务间谍；必须依靠广大华侨和归侨群众，发挥他们的积极性，才能把少数伪装华侨的敌人揭发出来。现在有一些地方，由于对华侨不了解，对归侨存有不必要的戒心，对侨汇多方盘问，对国外华侨影响非常不好。这些现象，其原因可能是由于对侨情不够了解的缘故，但必须坚决予以纠正。
    侨眷、归侨和归国华侨学生，他们或则亲人远在国外，或则回国以后，人地生疏，不谙乡土人情，或则初回国时，不习惯国内的生活，必须经常关心他们的生活和疾苦，同时从具体情况出发，耐心和细致地引导他们，帮助他们。任何粗糙、急躁、凭主观想像、不按政策办事的作风，都是会把好事办成坏事的。
    在侨眷、归侨人口众多的侨乡，侨务工作与中心工作，必须密切配合。要做好侨眷、归侨的工作，执行好侨务政策，发挥侨眷、归侨的积极性，才能做好中心工作。因为侨眷、归侨在经济上、生活习惯上有他们的特殊情况，所以，在进行和完成中心工作的方法上，步骤上，侨乡和一般地区，也应当因地制宜，有所不同。侨务工作是中心工作的一部分，它本身是为中心工作服务的；侨务工作必须为着完成一般的中心工作而努力，同时，中心工作在进行部署布置时，也必须考虑侨务工作的恰当的位置，并了解到像在侨乡这样特殊的地区，不做好侨务工作，就不能完成中心任务。在有少数归侨、侨眷和华侨学生的地方，以及有关的单位和学校，也应当将贯彻执行国家的侨务政策列入工作规划之内，加以应有的注意。
    经过会议深入的讨论，侨务政策是更加明确和具体了，现在，问题在于如何进一步地把它贯彻下去。各地侨乡党委必须重视侨务工作，认真传达和讨论国内侨务政策，根据侨眷和归侨的特点，布置工作，经常深入检查，及时地发现新情况、新问题，并迅速主动地加以解决。各地侨务部门必须健全自己的机构，重视归国华侨联谊会的工作，并善于求得各有关部门的支持和帮助，以便进一步贯彻侨务政策，开展侨务工作。
