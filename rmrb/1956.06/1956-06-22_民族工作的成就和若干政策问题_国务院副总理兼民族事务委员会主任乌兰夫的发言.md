Since the Second Session of the First National People’s Congress, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have launched a high tide of socialist construction and socialist transformation on a national scale. In the past year, along with the development of the national socialist cause, various construction undertakings in minority ethnic regions have also greatly developed, the unity among and within ethnic groups has been further consolidated, and the socialist consciousness and enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups have been unprecedentedly enhanced. At present, in minority ethnic regions, those with the conditions are actively carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation; those without the conditions are also actively creating conditions to embark on the socialist road. It can be seen that in the past year, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have achieved remarkable results in their efforts to realize the Party and the State's tasks in ethnic affairs during the transition period.

Two Major Events in the Political Life
of All Ethnic Groups

Last October 1, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, with the Uyghur ethnic group as the main body and including 13 ethnic groups, was established in the original Xinjiang Province. On April 22 this year, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, with a political power character, consisting of the Tibet Local Government, the Panchen Kanpo Council Hall Committee, and the Qamdo District People’s Liberation Committee, was established. When Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region were established, the Central Government sent representatives to participate and congratulate them. This is a new milestone in the close unity and common progress of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as throughout the country. The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has not only further strengthened the unity among and within ethnic groups in Xinjiang and Tibet, but also further consolidated the unification of the motherland and the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country. These are two major events in the political life of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. In the past year, we have also established seven ethnic autonomous counties; recently, the State Council decided to establish the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture and the Qian Nan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture; other minority ethnic areas without ethnic autonomous regions are also actively preparing to establish ethnic autonomous regions. After the State Council’s “Instructions on Several Issues Concerning the Establishment of Ethnic Townships” was issued last December, many ethnic townships have been established one after another. Now, the vast majority of the areas where the majority of minority ethnic groups live and the vast majority of the population have established autonomous regions. It is expected that those who have not established autonomous regions can also be established in another year or two. Ethnic autonomous regions have also made progress in exercising autonomous rights and realizing the nationalization of autonomous organs. The measures for the financial management of ethnic autonomous regions have been drafted after more than a year of repeated research, and will be promulgated and implemented after the completion of the legislative process. All ethnic autonomous regions pay great attention to the work of training ethnic cadres. By the end of last year, there were more than 204,000 ethnic cadres in the country, of which more than 43,000 were newly added in the past year alone. This is an important gain in realizing the nationalization of cadres in ethnic autonomous regions.

Years of experience have proven that ethnic regional autonomy is indeed the basic policy for solving ethnic issues in our country, and it has perfectly solved the problem of equality, unity, development, and unification of the great national family of our great motherland, which the people of all ethnic groups have longed for for generations.

Socialist Transformation of Agriculture

In the past year, in the minority ethnic agricultural areas with a population of nearly 30 million that have completed land reform, like the Han areas, a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture has been launched and a decisive victory has been achieved. Before the spring ploughing this year, most of these areas had basically realized semi-socialist or fully socialist cooperation. Among them, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, and the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province, the farmers participating in advanced cooperatives have accounted for more than 70% to 90% of the total number of local farmers; in Dachang Hui Autonomous County in Hebei Province, the farmers participating in advanced cooperatives have accounted for 99.6% of the total number of farmers in the county; other areas such as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and the minority ethnic agricultural areas of Gansu Province are expected to basically realize fully socialist cooperation by this winter and next spring. In the process of agricultural cooperation, a number of joint agricultural production cooperatives of various ethnic groups have been organized, some with two ethnic groups and some with several ethnic groups. The establishment of these cooperatives has made the people of all ethnic groups more closely united in the process of cooperation.

Some minority ethnic agricultural areas that have not undergone democratic reform have carried out democratic reform through peaceful consultation. For example, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of about 600,000 in the border areas of Yunnan; in the agricultural areas of Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, some counties have also basically completed land reform. After completing land reform, these areas began to establish agricultural production cooperatives. Now, all farmers in minority ethnic areas, like farmers in Han areas, have also been involved in a high tide of agricultural production to increase production and increase farmers’ personal income.

Socialist Transformation of Animal Husbandry

In minority ethnic pastoral areas where conditions are available, such as some pastoral areas in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is also gradually and steadily progressing. By the end of May this year, the number of herdsmen households organized in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region accounted for 72.7% of the total number of herdsmen households in the region, and the number of herdsmen households organized in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region accounted for 40% of the total number of herdsmen households in the region; most of these herdsmen households are still participating in mutual aid groups, but more than 320 livestock production cooperatives have also been developed in various places. In addition, nearly 200 state-owned ranches have been established in various places, and several joint state-private ranches have also been tried out.

The development of the agricultural and animal husbandry cooperation movement in minority ethnic areas has not only opened up broad avenues for the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production and the improvement of the lives of farmers and herdsmen in minority ethnic areas, enabling the working people of all ethnic groups to permanently get rid of the threat of poverty, but also enables them to develop mutual assistance and friendly relations in the new socialist relations of production, thereby further promoting the unity among and within ethnic groups.

Economic Construction and Cultural Education

In the past year, the economic construction undertakings in minority ethnic areas have also greatly developed. In the past year, the industrial output value of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased by 24.5% compared with the previous year, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region increased by 99.3%. The industrial output value of many other ethnic autonomous areas has also increased. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been laid for more than 700 kilometers; the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is under construction from both Baotou and Lanzhou; following the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet and Kangding-Tibet Highways, the Lhasa-Xigaze Highway, the Xigaze-Gyantse Highway, and the Pari-Yadong Highway have been opened to traffic; the air route from Beijing to Lhasa has been successfully test-flown. Geological exploration work in minority ethnic areas has also achieved great results. In the past year, a large part of the proven mineral deposits in the country were in minority ethnic areas. All of these have created favorable conditions for carrying out large-scale economic construction in minority ethnic areas and further improving the economic and cultural level of minority ethnic groups.

With the development of economic construction and the improvement and improvement of people's lives, the cultural and educational undertakings in minority ethnic areas have also developed considerably in the past year. The number of schools at all levels and the number of students from minority ethnic groups in minority ethnic areas have increased compared with before. The Tibet region only established its first primary school in 1952, and now it has developed to 31 schools and is preparing to establish middle schools. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have not only added specialized colleges, but are also preparing to establish comprehensive universities. In the past year, a total of 21 kinds of newspapers, 32 kinds of magazines, and 1,011 kinds of books were published in minority ethnic languages, with 7,343,000 copies. Health services in minority ethnic areas have also developed accordingly.

Creation and Improvement of Ethnic Writing Systems

In the past year, greater progress has been made in the work of helping ethnic groups without writing systems to create writing systems and helping ethnic groups with incomplete writing systems to improve their writing systems. Among the more than 35 million minority ethnic people in our country, about 20 million people do not have their own writing systems or do not have common writing systems. Helping them create or reform writing systems is an urgent political task. In the past few years, we have conducted some investigations and studies on minority ethnic languages, trained a group of cadres, and helped several ethnic groups formulate writing system plans or writing system improvement plans; however, this work has progressed too slowly to meet the urgent needs of minority ethnic people. Since last year, this aspect of the work has been strengthened. First of all, a writing system plan was designed for the Zhuang ethnic group, the most populous minority ethnic group in our country, and key language surveys were conducted in other minority ethnic areas. In December last year, a scientific discussion meeting on language and writing was held in Beijing, and a comprehensive plan for minority ethnic language and writing work in the next few years was proposed. This plan stipulates that within two or three years starting from 1956, a general survey of minority ethnic languages should be conducted, and those ethnic groups that need to create and reform writing systems should be assisted in completing the design of writing system plans. This is an arduous task. In order to accomplish this task, seven language and writing work teams composed of more than 600 minority ethnic language and writing workers have recently been formed to work in various minority ethnic areas.

Tremendous Help from the Central Government

In the past year, the various aspects of work in minority ethnic areas, especially economic and cultural construction, have made significant progress, and we believe that there will be even greater development in the coming year. The development of economy and culture in minority areas cannot be separated from the concern and help of the Central Government. We can see from the 1956 state budget that the Central Government has given more assistance to minority areas this year. In this year's state budget, expenditures on economic construction increased by 17.04% compared with last year, while the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased by 65.46%, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region increased by 54.31%, Qinghai increased by 118.14%, and Tibet increased by 27.27%. In this year's state budget, expenditures on social, cultural and educational affairs increased by 18.36% compared with last year, while the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased by 50.36%, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region increased by 25.96%, Qinghai increased by 71.32%, and Tibet increased by 28.72%. The expenditures on economic construction and social, cultural and educational affairs in other minority areas have also increased compared with last year. These enormous assistance are of great significance for developing the economy and culture in minority areas and gradually changing the backwardness of minority areas.

Constantly Overcoming Conservative Ideas and Impetuous Advance

The achievements in various aspects of ethnic work in the past year are inseparable from the constant overcoming of conservative ideas and impetuous advance. Some comrades who work in minority areas and in relevant departments have not actively done some things that have already been qualified or can be done with effort. This is not right. This situation has now changed greatly. However, the situation in which some regions and some departments do not pay enough attention to the interests of minority ethnic groups when considering economic and cultural construction issues still exists. They either do not pay more attention to the issue of how to help minority areas carry out construction, or they do not estimate more needs of minority ethnic groups in their own work plans, and do not put forward specific plans for developing economy and culture in minority areas. This situation still needs to be corrected in the future. Impetuous advance is also wrong at any time. Our work should be "prudent and steady". Things that cannot be done or should not be done at present cannot be forced. If you do it reluctantly, there will be only harm and no benefit. Under the current situation of the national socialist upsurge, comrades who work in minority ethnic areas and in relevant departments must always maintain a clear head, not only see the favorable conditions for the development of various tasks in minority ethnic areas, but also see the different situations between minority ethnic areas and Han areas. All our work in minority areas must proceed from the actual situation of the local areas, fully take into account the local ethnic characteristics, and ensure that our long-term plans, reform plans, work plans, and implemented measures in ethnic areas are all based on a secure, stable and feasible basis.

Mutual Assistance and Support between Han and Minority Ethnic Groups

Mutual assistance and support between the Han and various minority ethnic groups is an important guarantee for building our country into a great socialist country. In the future, the development of various undertakings in minority areas, as in the past few years, will still need the help of the Han, in addition to the efforts of the minority ethnic groups themselves. We must educate minority ethnic cadres and the broad masses of the people so that they understand that the assistance of the Han people, who account for 94% of the country's population, is a great force that enables them to transition to a socialist society. Similarly, it is impossible to build our country into a great socialist country without the joint efforts of minority ethnic groups. Therefore, we must also educate Han cadres and the broad masses of the people so that they understand that 60% of our country's territory is inhabited by minority ethnic groups, where there are endless material resources, and most of those areas are our country's borders. It should be seen that the people of minority ethnic groups have made great contributions in the creation of our great motherland and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, as well as in the socialist construction in recent years, and they will certainly make greater contributions in the future. It is right to say that the Han ethnic group has helped the minority ethnic groups; but at the same time, it must be said that the minority ethnic groups have also helped the Han ethnic group. The people of all ethnic groups in our country must help each other, support each other, and jointly build our great motherland.

Some Policies in Democratic Reform and Socialist Transformation

In the past year, democratic reform and socialist transformation in minority ethnic areas have all adopted peaceful methods. The work has been carried out smoothly and healthily. The broad masses of the people of minority ethnic groups warmly support democratic reform and socialist transformation; most of the upper-class figures of minority ethnic groups, recognizing the benefits of democratic reform and socialist transformation for the development of their own ethnic groups, especially seeing the fact that their personal political status is not changed and their living standards are not reduced in and after the reform, are also actively supporting democratic reform and socialist transformation. However, it should be pointed out that implementing social reform is, after all, to change the old system there, and it is impossible not to have a little obstruction and necessary struggle. A few minority ethnic areas have experienced a few people who do not understand the general situation, under the instigation of counter-revolutionary elements, taking actions that violate the will of the majority of the people of their own ethnic groups. For this kind of behavior, the People's Government, with the assistance of the local minority ethnic people and upper-class figures, has taken appropriate methods to basically solve the problems there, and has won over the vast majority of people who have made mistakes to repent. The state's policy on democratic reform in minority ethnic areas has always been very clear. We believe that if any ethnic group wants to change the backward state of all aspects left over from history, completely liberate its own ethnic group, and develop the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of the ethnic group, it is inevitable to carry out necessary social reforms internally. However, reforms related to the internal affairs of minority ethnic groups must be based on the wishes of the minority ethnic people and be carried out by the minority ethnic people themselves. Other ethnic groups cannot carry them out on their behalf, and the higher-level people's government cannot monopolize them. Since the situations of various ethnic groups are different, the methods, steps, and time of reform cannot be exactly the same; on these issues, it is necessary to fully consult with the people and public leaders of the ethnic groups concerned, and then proceed after discussion. For the upper-class figures of all aspects in all minority ethnic groups, the People's Government adheres to the policy of long-term unity and education. During and after the reform, the People's Government takes necessary measures to not only not change their political status, but also make their jobs properly arranged and their living standards not reduced. Even for those elements who once opposed democratic reform, as long as they are willing to repent and no longer oppose it, the People's Government will not hold them accountable. Those who held positions in the government and consultative organs in the past will retain their positions and be allowed to continue to participate in work. Those who did not participate in work in the past can also be arranged appropriate work if they are willing to work. The People's Government adopts a policy of protecting the religious beliefs and religious temples of the people of all minority ethnic groups. This was the case in the past, and it remains unchanged now and in the future. For minority ethnic pastoral areas, the People's Government continues to implement the policies of "no struggle, no division", "no class division", "benefit both herdsmen and herdowners" and developing the animal husbandry economy. It is certain that pastoral areas will also transition to socialist society. Some pastoral areas have already established cooperatives, and these cooperatives are well-run, developing animal husbandry production, improving the productive forces of pastoral areas, and also improving the material and cultural lives of herdsmen. However, according to the characteristics of the animal husbandry economy and the situation in pastoral areas, the time for pastoral areas to transition to socialist society may be longer. How pastoral areas transition to socialist society, the state will fully consider the characteristics of each pastoral area; at the same time, the people and public leaders of pastoral areas are allowed to carefully consider, and then proceed steadily after consideration. Do not proceed if you have not considered it carefully.

Overcoming and Preventing the Tendencies of Han Chauvinism and Local Nationalism

The ethnic work in the past year has achieved remarkable results, but there are still many shortcomings. At present, the main danger that must be vigilant and prevented in ethnic work is the ideological tendency of Han chauvinism. Of course, it is also very important to be vigilant and prevent the ideological tendency of local nationalism, but only on the basis of overcoming and preventing the ideological tendency of Han chauvinism can we better overcome and prevent the ideological tendency of local nationalism. In order to correctly implement the Party and the State's ethnic policies, it is absolutely necessary to regularly check our implementation of ethnic policies. In accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan and other places have already begun to conduct inspections, and other areas are preparing to conduct inspections, which is very good. It can be expected that after a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of various aspects of ethnic policies throughout the country, especially in the relevant areas and relevant departments, it will be possible to overcome the shortcomings and errors that still exist in ethnic work, overcome and prevent the tendencies of Han chauvinism and local nationalism, strengthen ethnic unity, give play to the socialist enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups, and realize the tasks of the Party and the State in the ethnic issues during the transition period.

    民族工作的成就和若干政策问题   
    ——国务院副总理兼民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫的发言
    自从第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议以后，我国各民族人民在全国范围内，掀起了一个社会主义建设和社会主义改造的高潮。一年来，随着全国社会主义事业的发展，少数民族地区的各项建设事业也得到了很大的发展，各民族之间和各民族内部的团结进一步巩固了，各民族人民的社会主义觉悟和积极性空前地提高了。目前，在少数民族地区，凡是条件具备的，已经在积极进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造；凡是条件还不具备的，也都在积极创造条件，走社会主义的道路。可以看出，一年来，我国各民族人民，在为实现过渡时期党和国家在民族问题方面的任务而作的努力中，已经获得了显著的成绩。
  各民族人民政治生活中的
          两件大事
    去年10月1日在原新疆省境内成立了以维吾尔族为主体，包括13个民族的新疆维吾尔自治区，今年4月22日又成立了包括西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会的、带有政权性质的西藏自治区筹备委员会，新疆维吾尔自治区和西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的时候，中央曾派代表前去参加和祝贺，这是新疆和西藏也是全国各民族人民亲密团结、共同进步的新的里程碑。新疆维吾尔自治区和西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，不仅进一步加强了新疆和西藏各民族间和民族内部的团结，而且也进一步巩固了祖国的统一和全国各民族的大团结。这是我国各民族人民政治生活中的两件大事。一年来，我们还建立了七个民族自治县；最近国务院又决定了要建立黔东南苗族侗族自治州和黔南布依族苗族自治州；其他一些没有建立民族自治地方的少数民族聚居区，也正在积极筹备建立民族自治地方。去年12月国务院“关于建立民族乡若干问题的指示”发布以后，许多民族乡也相继建立起来。现在，我国聚居的少数民族的绝大部分地区和绝大部分人口，已经先后建立了自治地方，尚未建立自治地方的，预计再有一两年，也都可以建立起来。各民族自治地方在行使自治权利和实现自治机关民族化方面也有进展。关于民族自治地方财政管理的办法，经过一年多的反复研究，现在已经草拟出来，待完成立法程序以后，即可公布施行；各民族自治地方对培养民族干部的工作都是很注意的，截至去年年底，全国已有民族干部204，000余人，其中仅去年一年内，新增加的干部就有43，000余人，这是实现民族自治地方干部民族化方面的一个重要收获。
    几年来的经验证明：民族区域自治确是解决我国民族问题的基本政策，而且已经完满地解决了我国各民族人民世世代代渴望的我们伟大祖国民族大家庭的平等、团结、发展和统一的问题。
    农业的社会主义改造
    一年来，在已经完成了土地改革的将近3千万人口的少数民族农业区，和汉族地区一样，也掀起了农业的社会主义改造的高潮，并且取得了决定性的胜利。到今年春耕以前，这些地区的绝大部分地区已经基本上实现了半社会主义的或全社会主义的合作化。其中内蒙古自治区，桂西僮族自治州、延边朝鲜族自治州和青海省的农业区等地，参加高级社的农户已经占当地总农户的70％——90％以上；河北省大厂回族自治县参加高级社的农户则已占全县总农户的99.6％；其他如新疆维吾尔自治区、湘西苗族自治州、海南黎族苗族自治州和甘肃省少数民族农业区等地，预计到今冬明春就可以基本上实现全社会主义的合作化。在农业合作化的过程中，组织起来了不少的各民族联合的农业生产合作社，有的社内是两个民族，有的社内是几个民族。这些合作社的建立，使得各民族人民在合作化的过程中更加亲密地团结起来了。
    有些没有经过民主改革的少数民族农业区，采取和平协商的方式进行了民主改革。如在云南边疆地区约有60万人口的地区完成了土地改革；四川省阿坝藏族自治州、甘孜藏族自治州和凉山彝族自治州农业区也有一部分县基本上完成了土地改革。这些地区在完成了土地改革以后，开始建立了农业生产合作社。现在，少数民族地区的全体农民，和汉族地区的农民一样，也卷入了为增加生产和增加农民个人收入的农业生产的高潮。
    畜牧业的社会主义改造
    在条件具备的少数民族牧业区，如内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区的某些牧区，畜牧业的社会主义改造也在逐渐地、稳步地进行着。到今年五月底，内蒙古自治区组织起来的牧户已占全区总牧户的72.7％，新疆维吾尔自治区组织起来的牧户占全区总牧户的40％；这些牧户大部分还是参加互助组的，但是各地畜牧业生产合作社也已发展到320多个。此外，各地还建立了将近200个国营牧场，也试办了几个公私合营牧场。
    少数民族地区农牧业合作化运动的发展，不仅为少数民族农牧业的生产发展和农牧民的生活改善开辟了广阔的道路，使各民族劳动人民得以永远摆脱贫困的威胁，而且能够使他们在新的社会主义的生产关系中，发展了互助友爱的关系，从而也更加促进了各民族之间和民族内部的团结。
  经济建设和文化教育事业
    一年来，少数民族地区的经济建设事业也有了很大的发展。去年一年内，内蒙古自治区的工业产值比前年增长了24.5％，新疆维吾尔自治区增长了99.3％，其他许多民族自治地方的工业产值都有增加。兰新铁路已经铺轨700多公里；包兰铁路正在从包头和兰州两面紧张修建；继青藏、康藏公路通车之后，拉萨—日喀则、日喀则—江孜公路和帕里—亚东公路已经通车；北京到拉萨的航线已经试航成功。少数民族地区的地质勘探工作也获得了很大成绩，去年一年内，全国探明的矿藏，很大部分是在少数民族地区。所有这些，都为在少数民族地区进行大规模的经济建设和进一步提高少数民族的经济文化水平，创造了有利条件。
    随着经济建设事业的发展，人民生活的改善和提高，一年来少数民族地区的文化、教育事业也有了相当的发展。少数民族地区的各级学校和少数民族的学生比较以前都有增加。西藏地方在1952年才成立了第一所小学，现在已经发展到31所，并且准备设立中学。内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区不但增设了专业学院，而且正在筹备成立综合大学。去年一年内，用少数民族文字出版的报纸共有21种，杂志32种，书籍1，011种，7，343，000册。少数民族地区的卫生事业，也有相应的发展。
  创立和改进民族文字工作
      帮助尚无文字的民族创立文字、帮助文字不完备的民族改进文字的工作，一年来获得了较大的进展。我国3，500多万少数民族人民中，约有两千多万人没有自己的文字或者没有通用的文字，帮助他们创制或者改革文字，是一个迫切的政治任务。过去几年来，我们在少数民族语文工作上进行了一些调查研究，培养了一批干部，并且帮助几个民族拟定了文字方案或文字改进方案；但是，这个工作进行得太慢，不能满足少数民族人民的迫切需要。从去年起，开始加强了这方面的工作。首先是帮助我国少数民族中人口最多的僮族设计出了文字方案，并在其他几个少数民族地区进行了语言的重点调查。去年十二月在北京召开了语文科学讨论会，提出了今后几年内少数民族语文工作的全面规划。这个规划规定，在从1956年开始的两、三年时间内，要普遍调查少数民族的语言，并帮助那些需要创制和改革文字的民族完成文字方案的设计工作。这是一项艰巨的任务。为了完成这个任务，最近已经由600多个少数民族语文工作人员组成了7个语文工作队，到各少数民族地区进行工作。
      中央的巨大帮助
    在过去的一年里，少数民族地区的各方面工作，特别是经济和文化建设事业，都有了显著的进步，我们相信，今后的一年会有更大的发展。少数民族地区经济文化的发展是和中央的关怀与帮助分不开的，我们从1956年国家预算中可以看出，中央今年给了少数民族地区更大的帮助。今年国家预算中经济建设费类的支出比去年增长17.04％，而内蒙古自治区则增长65.46％，新疆维吾尔自治区增长54.31％，青海增长118.14％，西藏增长27.27％。今年国家预算中社会文教费类的支出比去年增长18.36％，而内蒙古自治区则增长50.36％，新疆维吾尔自治区增长25.96％，青海增长71.32％，西藏增长28.72％。其他少数民族地区的经济建设和社会文教费的支出，也同样都比去年有所增长。这些巨大的帮助，对发展少数民族地区的经济和文化，逐步改变少数民族地区的落后面貌是有重大意义的。
    不断克服保守思想和
            急躁冒进
    一年来，民族工作各方面成绩的取得，是和不断克服保守思想与急躁冒进分不开的。有些在少数民族地区工作和在有关部门工作的同志，对有些条件已经具备了或者经过努力可以作到的事情，没有积极去做，这是不对的。这种情况现在已经大大地改变了。但是，有些地区和有些部门在考虑经济、文化建设问题的时候，注意少数民族利益不够的情况还是存在的，他们或者是没有更多的去注意如何帮助少数民族地区进行建设的问题，或者是在他们自己的工作规划中没有更多的估计少数民族的需要，没有提出在少数民族地区的发展经济和文化的具体计划。这种情况还需要在今后继续改正。急躁冒进的作法在任何时候也是错误的。我们的工作应该“慎重稳进”。在目前还作不到或者不应该作的事情，是不能勉强去做的。勉强做了，只有坏处，没有好处。在当前全国社会主义高潮的形势下，在少数民族地区工作和在有关部门工作的同志，必须时刻保持清醒的头脑，既要看到少数民族地区各项工作向前发展的有利条件，也还要看到少数民族地区和汉族地区的不同情况。我们在少数民族地区的各项工作必须从当地的实际情况出发，充分照顾到当地的民族特点，务必使我们在民族地区的远景规划、改革计划、工作计划和实行的措施等等，都建立在有把握的、稳妥的、切实可行的基础上。
  汉族和少数民族互相帮助
            互相支援
    汉族和各少数民族之间的互相帮助、互相支援，是把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的重要保证。今后，少数民族地区各项事业的发展和过去几年一样，除少数民族自己的努力以外，仍然需要汉族的帮助。我们必须向少数民族干部和广大的人民群众进行教育，使他们懂得，占全国人口94％的汉族人民对他们的帮助，是使他们能够过渡到社会主义社会的伟大力量。同样的，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，离开少数民族的共同努力，也是不行的。因之，我们也必须向汉族干部和广大的人民群众进行教育，使他们懂得，我国领土的60％是少数民族聚居的地区，那里有着无穷无尽的物质资源，那里绝大部分地区又是我国的边疆。应该看到，少数民族人民，在我们伟大祖国的缔造和中华人民共和国的成立以及几年来的社会主义建设事业中，已经提供了伟大的贡献，今后一定还会有更大的贡献。我们说汉族帮助了少数民族，这是对的；但是同时必须说少数民族同样也帮助了汉族。我国各民族人民必须互相帮助，互相支援，共同来建设我们伟大的祖国。
  民主改革和社会主义改造
        中的一些政策
    一年来，少数民族地区的民主改革和社会主义改造，一律采取了和平的方法，工作的进行是顺利的、健康的，少数民族广大人民群众对于民主改革和社会主义改造是热烈拥护的；少数民族的上层人物由于认识到民主改革和社会主义改造对于本民族发展的好处，特别是看到在改革中、改革以后不改变他们个人的政治地位和不降低生活水平的事实，因而绝大多数对于民主改革和社会主义改造也是积极赞助的。但是应该指出，实行社会改革，毕竟是要改变那里的旧制度，不可能没有一点阻碍和必要的斗争。个别少数民族地区曾经发生过少数不明大义的分子在反革命分子的煽动下，采取了违背本民族大多数人民志愿的行为。对于这种行为，人民政府在当地少数民族人民和上层人物的协助下，采取适当方法，已经基本上解决了那里的问题，争取了绝大多数犯错误的人悔改过来。国家对于少数民族地区民主改革的政策，从来是很明白的。我们认为，任何一个民族如果要改变历史上遗留下来的各方面的落后状态，彻底解放自己的民族，发展民族的政治、经济和文化事业，就不可避免地要在内部进行必要的社会改革。但是，有关少数民族内部的改革必须依据少数民族人民的意愿，并且由少数民族人民自己去做，别的民族不能代替进行，上级人民政府也不能包办。由于各民族的情况不同，改革的方法、步骤和时间也不可能完全一样；在这些问题上都要和各有关少数民族的人民和公众领袖充分商量，商量好了再办。对于各少数民族中的各方面的上层人士，人民政府坚持长期团结教育的政策，在改革的时候和改革以后，人民政府都采取必要的办法，不但不改变他们的政治地位，还要使他们的工作职位得到适当的安排和生活水平不至于降低。就是对于那些曾经反对过民主改革的分子，只要他们愿意悔改，不再反对了，人民政府也一律不咎既往，过去在政府和协商机关任职的，仍然保留职务，允许他们继续参加工作。过去没有参加工作的，如果愿意工作，还可以安排适当的工作。对于各少数民族人民的宗教信仰和宗教寺庙，人民政府采取保护的政策。过去如此，现在和将来也仍然不变。对于少数民族畜牧业区，人民政府继续执行“不斗不分”、“不划阶级”、“牧工牧主两利”和发展畜牧业经济的政策。牧业区也要向社会主义社会过渡，这是肯定的，现在有些牧业区就已经办起了合作社，并且这些合作社是办得很好的，发展了畜牧业生产，提高了牧业区的生产力，也提高了牧民的物质和文化生活水平。但是，根据畜牧业经济的特点和牧业区的情况，牧业区过渡到社会主义社会的时间可能要更长一些。牧业区如何向社会主义社会过渡，国家将充分照顾到各个牧业区的特点；同时，允许牧业区的人民和公众领袖从容加以考虑，考虑好了再稳步去办，没有考虑好就不要去办。
  克服和防止大民族主义和
    地方民族主义思想倾向
    一年来的少数民族工作是获得了显著成绩的，但是也还是存在着不少的缺点。现在，在少数民族工作中必须警惕和防止的主要危险是大民族主义的思想倾向，自然，警惕和防止地方民族主义思想倾向也是很重要的，但是只有在克服和防止了大民族主义思想倾向的基础上，才能更好地克服和防止地方民族主义思想倾向。为了正确地贯彻执行党和国家的民族政策，经常检查我们对民族政策的执行情况是完全必须的。遵照中共中央的指示，现在贵州、云南、四川等地已经在开始进行检查，其他一些地区也正在准备进行检查，这是很好的。可以预计，在全国范围内，特别是各有关地区和有关部门，普遍地进行一次关于民族政策各方面的执行情况的检查以后，对于克服少数民族工作中还存在的缺点和错误，克服和防止大民族主义和地方民族主义倾向，加强民族团结，发挥各民族人民的社会主义积极性，实现过渡时期党和国家在民族问题方面的任务，一定能够产生重大的良好的效果。
