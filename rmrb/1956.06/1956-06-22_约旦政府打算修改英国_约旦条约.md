Xinhua News Agency, Amman, June 21st: Jordanian Prime Minister al-Mufti announced in Parliament on June 20th that his government intends to revise the British-Jordanian treaty.

	While reading the new government's policy statement, he said that due to national interests and changes in the army structure, it is inevitable to revise the British-Jordanian treaty signed in 1948. This treaty stipulates that Britain has the right to maintain air bases in Jordan and control the "Arab Legion." The Jordanian government had already dismissed British officer Glubb Pasha from his position as commander of the "Arab Legion" in March of this year.

	Al-Mufti also announced that Jordan does not intend to participate in foreign treaties. He said that this decision was made based on Jordan's belief that the defense of the Arab world is solely the responsibility of Arab countries.

	He welcomed the offer of financial assistance from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.

	The Jordanian Parliament is scheduled to meet on June 27th to discuss al-Mufti's policy statement.

    约旦政府打算修改英国—约旦条约
    新华社21日讯　安曼消息：约旦新首相穆弗蒂六月二十日在议会中宣布，他的政府打算修改英国—约旦条约。
    他在宣读新政府的政策声明的时候说，由于民族利益和军队结构改变的结果，修改1948年签订的英国—约旦条约是不可避免的事。这个条约规定英国有权在约旦保持空军基地，并且控制“阿拉伯军团”。约旦政府已经在今年三月间解除了英国军官格拉布的“阿拉伯军团”司令的职务。
    穆弗蒂还宣布，约旦不打算参加外国条约。他说，这个决定是根据约旦认为阿拉伯世界的防御只是阿拉伯国家的责任的看法作出的。
    他对埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯三国建议提供的财政援助表示欢迎。
    约旦议会预定在六月二十七日举行会议，讨论穆弗蒂的政策声明。
