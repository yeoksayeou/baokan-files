Renmin University of China's Supplementary Explanation Regarding Candidate Travel Expenses

To the Editor:

    In the "Reader's Letters" section of May 20th, our university published "Answers to Readers' Questions Regarding Renmin University of China's Enrollment This Year," in which it was stated: "Candidates are responsible for their own food, lodging, and round-trip travel expenses during the examination period." This refers to the application of young students. As for the application of cadres from government organizations and the travel expenses for those who are admitted to the university for registration, they are all to be covered by their original work units according to the State Council's regulations. This is a supplementary explanation.

    中国人民大学关于考生路费问题的补充说明编辑同志：
    五月二十日“读者来信专页”发表了我校“关于中国人民大学今年招生问题”的“答读者问”，其中曾谈到：“考生在考期的食宿及往返路费等问题，由考生个人解决”。这是指青年学生报考而言。至于机关干部的报考和录取赴校报到的路费等，按国务院规定均由原工作单位负责解决。特此补充说明。
