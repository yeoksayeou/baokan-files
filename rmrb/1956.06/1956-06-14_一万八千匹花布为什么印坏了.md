    Why Were Eighteen Thousand Bolts of Printed Cloth Spoiled?
    By Our Reporter Jin Yukun

    Turning white cloth into colorful fabric requires many processes, and the mercerization process is crucial to the quality. After the white cloth goes through this process, the surface becomes smooth and glossy, the colors become bright, and it becomes resistant to washing, sun, and wear. However, the Liaoning Printing and Dyeing Factory, in the midst of a further surge in the socialist competition this year, rashly eliminated this process in order to complete its production value targets and shorten the dyeing time.

    The Liaoning Printing and Dyeing Factory eliminated this process in order to make up for the production shortfalls in January and February of this year. This method was devised by Zhang Fengge, head of the production section, and staff member Shi Hengru, based on instructions from acting factory director Liu Shuqing. As a result, the time to dye a bolt of cloth was shortened from about thirty hours to about twenty-four hours, which greatly increased production and saved a lot of electricity and caustic soda. However, the quality of the dyed cloth was not as good as before: the white base was not white, but like a yellowish blue cloth; the lilac flowers were not bright; and the snowflake dots were unclear, looking all dull and messy.

    Soon after the Liaoning Printing and Dyeing Factory decided to eliminate the mercerization process, the Jinzhou Textile, Cotton Yarn, and Fabric Company raised objections, but acting factory director Liu Shuqing considered this "conservative thinking." He asked engineer Zhou Zhidong to write an explanation of the technical basis for not needing the mercerization process. The engineer didn't want to write it, but he was afraid of being labeled as not supporting the "suggestion" and being given a "conservative thinking" label. As a result, he wrote a vague explanation, saying that whether or not the mercerization process was needed depended on "the requirements of the commodity." Therefore, eliminating this process was not considered wrong.

    Some employees in the factory also raised objections. Liu Shuqing also said that it was now very important to save electricity, and if electricity consumption was not reduced, they would be threatened with power outages, so they had no choice but to eliminate the mercerization process.

    The matter came to the attention of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry. The Department of Industry twice instructed the Liaoning Printing and Dyeing Factory not to eliminate the mercerization process, and that reducing quality was not allowed. Although Liu Shuqing agreed verbally, he did not formally issue an order to implement it.

    Bolts of poor-quality printed cloth came out of the workshop one after another, but the daily production reports showed that they were all first-class products. Why were substandard products becoming first-class products? The factory's inspection section had its own difficulties. Last October, more than a thousand bolts of cloth were misaligned, and the inspection section downgraded them to second-class products according to national standards, which aroused the factory director's dissatisfaction. He immediately ordered the inspection section to release them as first-class products, arguing that they "did not affect use." Not long ago, in order for the products to "pass smoothly" through quality inspection, the factory director decided to place the fabric inspection section, which makes the final decision on product grades, under the leadership of the production workshop (which has since been corrected by the Department of Industry). In this way, the work of the inspection section was inevitably affected, and some inspectors lacked a sense of responsibility, using the excuse that strict inspection would affect "tasks" and workers' "enthusiasm," thus lowering quality standards.

    Poor-quality printed cloth continued to be produced. In mid-March, the manager of the Provincial Textile, Cotton Yarn, and Fabric Company personally called the Department of Industry to express his opinion: "If you continue to do this, we will not accept them." And he had already notified the Jinzhou Textile, Cotton Yarn, and Fabric Company to stop supplying the factory with white cloth. The Department of Industry called Liu Shuqing on the same day, ordering him to immediately implement the instructions of the Department of Industry and ordering that all unmercerized products should not leave the factory. It was not until then that Liu Shuqing formally issued the order of the Department of Industry.

    This is how the quality accident involving eighteen thousand bolts of cloth occurred.

    The Liaoning Printing and Dyeing Factory's disregard for quality is not limited to this one instance. In January of this year, the factory produced seventeen varieties of cloth, none of which met the quality plan. In February, it produced fourteen varieties of cloth, and only two met the quality plan. In March, of the fourteen varieties planned, only two met the quality plan.

    This factory director has also made self-criticisms for quality accidents more than once. Last March, at the first Liaoning Provincial Local Industry Conference, he made a "profound self-criticism" for neglecting quality, but not long after, another accident occurred in which he simply pursued savings figures and disregarded quality. After the Liaoning Daily publicly criticized him, he made a "painful self-criticism." On January 17 of this year, at a meeting, he made a similar self-criticism. But then this quality accident involving eighteen thousand bolts of cloth occurred. May I ask this factory director, when will you be able to stop making self-criticisms for neglecting quality?

    一万八千匹花布为什么印坏了 
    本报记者　金雨困
    把白布印染成彩色的布，要经过许多工序，而丝光工序是其中对质量起决定作用的工序。白布经过这道工序后，布的表面就变的光滑，有光泽，颜色也鲜明，并且耐洗、耐晒、耐磨。但是，辽宁印染厂在今年社会主义竞赛进一步高涨中，为了完成产值任务，缩短印染时间，竟轻率地取消了这道工序。
    辽宁印染厂取消这道工序，为的是弥补今年一、二月份亏欠的产量。这个办法还是生产科科长张凤阁和科员石恒孺等根据代厂长刘述清的指示想出来的。结果印染一匹布的时间从原来三十小时左右缩短到二十四小时左右，从而就可以大大增加产量，同时节约大量电力和火碱，但是印染布的质量不如以前了：白底不白，像发黄的蓝布一样；青莲色的花朵不鲜；雪花点子不清，看去全是乌糟糟的。
    辽宁印染厂决定取消丝光工序不久，锦州市花纱布公司就提出不同的意见，代厂长刘述清却认为这是“保守思想”。他要工程师周之栋写一个不要丝光工序的技术根据的说明。工程师想不写，但是又怕被说不支持“建议”，给戴上“保守思想”的帽子，结果就写了个似是而非的说明，大意是需要不需要丝光工序，要看“商品的要求”而定。所以，取消这道工序也不算错误。
    厂里有的职工也提出了反对意见。刘述清又说现在非常强调节约用电，如果不降低用电量，就要受到停电的威胁，因此才不得不取消丝光工序。
    事情被辽宁省工业厅知道了。工业厅曾两次指示辽宁印染厂不要取消丝光工序，降低质量的做法是不能允许的。刘述清虽然一口答应，但是并没有正式下达执行。
    印染质量低劣的花布从车间里一匹一匹地出来，然而从每天的生产报表上来看，全是一等品。为什么次品成了一等品呢？工厂的检查科有它自己的苦衷。去年十月有千多匹花布对花不正，检查科按照国家标准把它降为二等品，就引起了厂长的不满，马上以“不影响使用”为理由，命令检查科按一等品出厂。不久前，厂长为了产品能“顺利通过”质量检查，就决定把最后决定产品等级的验布工段划归生产车间领导（已经为工业厅纠正）。这样，检查科的工作就不能不受到影响，加上某些检查人员缺乏责任心，就借口检查过严会影响“任务”和工人“积极性”，降低了质量标准。
    质量低劣的花布还在继续生产。三月中旬，省花纱布公司经理亲自打电话向工业厅提出意见：“如果继续这样做，我们就不收了”。而且已经通知锦州市花纱布公司，停止供应这个厂的白坯布。工业厅当天就给刘述清打了电话，要他立即执行工业厅的指示，命令所有不丝光的产品不准出厂。并且告诉他们工业厅将派人前来检查。直到这时，刘述清才正式下达工业厅的命令。
    就这样造成了一万八千匹花布质量事故。
    辽宁印染厂忽视质量的事实还不只这一次。今年一月份，这个工厂生产十七种品种的布匹，质量计划一种也没有完成。二月份生产十四种品种的布匹，质量计划也只完成两种。三月份十四种品种计划，只有两种完成质量计划。
    这位厂长为质量事故做检讨也不止一次了。去年三月在辽宁省第一届地方工业会议上，他做过忽视质量的“深刻检讨”，但是没有多久，就又发生了单纯追求节约数字，不顾质量的事故。辽宁日报公开批评后，他又做“沉痛检讨”。今年一月十七日在一个会议上，他又做了类似的检查。可是接着又发生了这一次一万八千匹布的质量事故。请问这位厂长，你什么时候才能不再作忽视质量的检讨呢？
