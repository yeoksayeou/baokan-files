Sichuan's pig resources have greatly developed this year. In the three months from January to March alone, the number of sows increased by 400,000. Last winter and this spring, the source of piglets in various places was generally insufficient, and the number of pigs decreased. In order to expand the source of breeding pigs, various places have vigorously bred sows in accordance with the principle of self-breeding and self-raising. In Nanchong Prefecture alone, the number of sows increased by more than 70% compared with the same period last year. With the development of sows, the number of piglets is constantly increasing. In Mianzhu County, 18,000 sows bred 144,000 piglets in 50 days, making the total number of pigs in the county increase by more than 60% compared with last year. (Our correspondent in Chengdu)

    四川省养猪数量增加
    四川今年猪源有很大发展，仅一月到三月的三个月中，母猪就增加了四十万只。去冬今春各地小猪来源普遍不足，猪只减少，为扩大繁殖猪源，各地根据自繁自养的方针，大力繁殖母猪，仅南充专区母猪今年就比去年同期增加70％多。随着母猪的发展，猪仔不断增加，绵竹县一万八千只母猪五十天中就繁殖小猪十四万四千只，使全县猪只比去年增加60％以上。（本报驻成都记者）
