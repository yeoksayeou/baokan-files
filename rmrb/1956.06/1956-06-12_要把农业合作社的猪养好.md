    To Raise Pigs Well in Agricultural Cooperatives
    The Pigs Here Don't Cry Anymore
    By Xu Xin
    Editor's Note: Some agricultural production cooperatives don't know how to raise pigs, and large numbers of pigs are raised too thin or die. This is a major problem that must be addressed.
    If agricultural production cooperatives want to raise pigs well, they must have four necessary conditions: first, they must have necessary pigsties. Second, they must have feed. Third, they must know how to feed and manage them. Fourth, they must prevent pigs from getting sick.
    Of course, it is currently difficult for agricultural production cooperatives to fully meet these four conditions. However, the state and the people need to develop hog production in large quantities. So, what should we do? This requires strict adherence to their own conditions. Collective feeding should be adopted if possible, and decentralized feeding should be adopted if collective feeding is not possible. As long as this is truly achieved, cooperatives can raise pigs well, and the pigs will not cry.
    In early February, after Lingxi District, Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province, achieved advanced agricultural cooperation, a high tide of collective pig raising in advanced cooperatives quickly emerged. At that time, all cooperatives emphasized collective pig raising. Township staff believed that the more pigs raised, the more impressive it was, and cooperative staff thought that the more pigs raised, the more glorious it was. Duìwù Township's Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative planned to buy 1,000 pigs and build 200 new pigsties. As a result, it bought a large number of pigs in and outside the township. In this way, within a short period of time, pork prices increased by more than 30%. The state bank used a large amount of loans to help cooperatives buy pigs.
    Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative used more than 3,000 yuan in loans to build more than 100 new pig houses and buy more than 100 pigs. However, problems arose from this point on! Some pigs were raised too thin, some pigs died, and some piglets were eaten by civet cats. The chaos increased, and later, the sound of pigs crying could be heard everywhere.
    Why were the pigs crying? One reason was a shortage of feed. At first, everyone expected the government to supply feed. Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative requested the government to supply more than 10,000 jin. But how could the government supply so much feed? If they couldn't get it from above, the cooperative had to ask from below. Xingxing Cooperative in Duiwu Township raised feed from its members twice in three days, collecting 263.48 jin of revolving grain and rations. With a shortage of feed, the pigs were hungry, so naturally they did not grow. Two litters of piglets in Lingxi Cooperative could not eat anything even after being raised for more than two months. The Third Cooperative of Lingjiang Township bought ten piglets, and after raising them for forty days, their total weight decreased by twenty-two jin. The sows of Shanglin Cooperative in Duiwu Township were not fed enough, and jumped out of the pigsty at night to eat grass seeds and wheat in the fields. The members sarcastically said: Our sows can fly at night! Because of the lack of feed, six cooperatives lost a total of fifty-two piglets.
    The second reason was poor management. Many cooperatives did not have dedicated personnel to manage the pigs raised collectively. Some cooperative's feeders lacked pig-raising experience and were irresponsible, which also caused many problems. Jinqiao Cooperative lost ten of its twelve piglets to civet cats.
    The third reason was a lack of pigsties. Many cooperatives put more than a dozen pigs in one pen. Members of the Shanglin Agricultural Production Cooperative reflected: Our sows eat from a big pot, and fight every day. Fighting inevitably leads to death. Many cooperatives lost money in this way. For example, Xingxing Cooperative bought twelve fattening pigs, fifteen sows, and four litters of piglets, and lost 275.5 yuan in less than a month.
    After discovering the above situation, the Lingxi District Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an in-depth inspection. The District Committee believed that some agricultural production cooperatives were not yet equipped to raise pigs collectively on a large scale, and it was better to adopt unified management and decentralized feeding. The District Committee convened a meeting of branch secretaries from various townships to study the issue of improving pig raising. After the meeting, each township decided to implement a "three-guarantee" method for sow raising: ① Guarantee yield: generally calculated as each sow producing two litters of twenty piglets per year, raising them for sixty days, guaranteeing a yield of 380 jin. ② Guarantee feed: each sow raised for one year, and twenty piglets raised for sixty days, the feeding households are given 150 jin of rotten sweet potato shreds, sixty jin of wheat, and twenty-eight yuan in cash. ③ Guarantee work points: 380 work points are given for raising one sow for one year. Each cooperative also formulated reward and punishment systems: for each litter of piglets exceeding ten, 80% of the excess is rewarded; for those less than ten, they must be responsible for compensation; however, in the event of irresistible disasters and losses, no compensation is required. Fattening pigs are generally distributed to members for private raising, and the cooperative purchases them when they are fattened. Only Xinmin Cooperative, with its better conditions, still retains a portion of fattening pigs for collective raising by the cooperative.
    In order to solve the feed problem, in addition to each cooperative actively mobilizing members to cut more green and coarse feed, the District Committee also tried to supply more rice bran and miscellaneous grains.
    After adopting the contract system, the situation quickly changed. Pig-raising households in Shanglin Agricultural Production Cooperative and Jinqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Duiwu Township took the initiative to cut green and coarse feed. Members reflected: Now our pigs are well-fed and kept warm. Cai Kaiyao took a piglet weighing eleven jin from the cooperative, and it grew six and a half jin in half a month.

    Advanced Feeding Management Methods
    Gu Hongmin
    In 1954, when Shunjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative of Shidong Township, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, was still a primary cooperative, it raised 134 publicly owned pigs. At that time, because there was no experience in collective pig raising, the management committee did not strengthen leadership, and these pigs were not well fed. The labor remuneration of the feeders was also unreasonable. The feeder, Qiu Xuebin, felt that feeding pigs was smelly and tiring, and only got ten points a day, which he was very dissatisfied with. He did not feed them well, and sometimes only fed the pigs once in the morning, and did not feed them a second time until dark; the pigsty was very unhygienic, and he did not care even if the pigs were covered in lice. The cooperative also did not prepare enough feed. Last spring, for more than two months, the pigs were not full every day. Whenever they were fed, the pigs would bite each other, some were bitten until they bled, and developed boils as big as teacups. In this way, many pigs did not grow well. Now there are still more than twenty thin and weak pigs in the cooperative, which have been fed for two years, but their weight is still less than 50 jin. Some members sarcastically said: The cooperative is raising truly long-lived pigs!
    After Shunjiang Cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative, the number of publicly owned pigs increased a lot, and improving the feeding management of pigs became more urgent. The Party branch and the management committee studied this issue, and also convened feeders to discuss it, letting everyone discuss how to improve feeding management. Based on everyone's opinions, the management committee decided to implement a contract system in the pig farm. However, some feeders had concerns. The management committee used specific facts to explain the benefits of improving feeding management to the feeders, strengthened their sense of responsibility for pig raising, and also organized them to visit the pig farm of the prefectural agricultural farm. In this way, everyone's concerns were eliminated. After repeated discussion and research by everyone, the contract system was formulated:
    1. Contracting labor. According to the size of the pigs and the difficulty of the work, it was determined that: after the piglets are fed for two full months, each person feeds 140 pigs in the third month; 110 pigs in the 4th to 5th months; 95 pigs in the 6th to 7th months; and 80 pigs in the 8th to 12th months. These are all first-class level work, and are recorded as 1.2 workdays per day. Each pig gets an average of 4.5 workdays from the time it is a piglet that is two full months old to the fattening period. It was also determined that: each person feeds 15 sows and one boar, which is considered first-class level work, and feeding one pig for the whole year gets 27 workdays.
    2. Contracting yield. Each fattening pig is required to have a gross weight of 220 jin per year, each sow produces 15 piglets per year, and each piglet reaches 20 jin in weight when it is two full months old.
    3. Contracting feed. Each fattening pig is supplied with 350 jin of refined feed (peanut bran, rice bran, rapeseed cake and part of the grain), 213 jin of roughage, and 3,000 jin of green feed per year. Each sow is given 700 jin of refined feed (rapeseed cake, bran), 750 jin of roughage, 7,200 jin of green feed, 2 jin of edible salt, and 12 jin of lime; in addition, 225 jin of fuel is given. Each piglet is given 23 jin of refined feed, 20 jin of green feed, and 5 jin of fuel until it is two full months old.
    After the contract was established, the feeders also discussed the reward and punishment system of "three rewards" and "three compensations". The "three rewards" are: first, a reward of 15 workdays if no pigs die throughout the year; second, a reward of 20% of the excess for exceeding the task; a reward of 50% of the work points for shortening the period of early fattening; third, rewards are given to management personnel and feeders who have made special achievements. The "three compensations" are: first, compensation of 30% of the loss if a pig dies due to poor management; second, those who do not complete the quota indicators will be compensated at the discretion of the management committee; third, management personnel and feeders will also be compensated for losses caused by dereliction of duty. However, if the feeding management and epidemic prevention and hygiene work is done well, and death occurs due to irresistible disasters, the feeders will not compensate; the feeders will also not compensate if the feeders cannot reach the contracted quota due to the untimely supply of feed. According to this system, assessments are made quarterly, and rewards and punishments are given at the end of the year.
    While implementing the contract system, the pig farm also studied pig-raising technical measures with the district agricultural technology guidance station, and specifically stipulated that pigs should be fed at fixed times and in fixed quantities, the pen should be dry, the food should be clean, disinfection and isolation should be carried out, epidemic prevention should be carried out at fixed times, and "double mating" of sows should be implemented, etc.
    The most difficult problem to solve in the development of pig production is feed. At first, some members said: There is no trick to feeding pigs, and they can't be fed full without grain. Some members asked the cooperative for corn to feed the pigs as soon as they opened their mouths. The management committee educated the members on saving grain and reducing costs, and with the help of the technology station, found a way to feed pigs with substitutes, and demonstrated it to the feeders. The first experiment was to fry peanut shells in a pot, grind them into a fine powder, and mix them into the feed, which the pigs liked to eat very much. After more than ten days, the pigs became black and shiny. The second experiment was to soak sugarcane residue in lime water (using 1.5 jin of lime to 100 jin of water), and after fifteen minutes, the sugarcane residue became like fresh green grass, becoming a very good feed. Now, Shunjiang Cooperative often uses more than 50 kinds of substitute feed. The cooperative has also established fixed feed production areas. The feeders no longer complain about a shortage of feed.
    Modulating feed, improving the taste quality of the feed, increasing the appetite of pigs, and utilizing a variety of feeds are good ways to reduce costs and obtain more products. Shunjiang Cooperative pays great attention to matching feed according to the growth law of pigs. For example, when pigs are fed to five or six months old, it is the time to grow muscles and bones, and it is necessary to feed more wild peanuts, wild wheat, Jerusalem artichoke stalks, soybean shells, rice husks, rapeseed shells and other feeds containing more protein and minerals; when pigs grow to eight or nine months old, they need to accumulate fat, and it is necessary to feed more sweet potato bran and other feeds containing more carbohydrates; after August and September, it is the time to "fatten them up", and it is even more necessary to supply feed rich in carbohydrates. After feeder Zhang Hongwu of the Fifth Pig Farm adopted this method of feeding pigs, the frame pigs grew an average of twelve taels of meat per day. In order to prepare the feed well, Shunjiang Cooperative is building a feed processing plant. With a processing plant, the utilization rate of feed can be further improved.
    In the process of implementing the contract system and other methods, ideological education for feeders has also been strengthened. Shunjiang Cooperative has assigned a deputy industry and commerce director to be specifically responsible for this work. The cooperative holds two feeder meetings every month to exchange experiences and compete with each other. Wang Shaowu, a feeder, did not clean the pigsty for several days during a period of time, and also stole the cooperative's feed, so he was criticized at the meeting. Zhang Hongwu worked actively and responsibly, cutting the pig grass finely, modulating it well, and feeding the pigs very fat. After assessment by the members, he was rewarded with three workdays in February this year. Through this kind of education, the feeders feed each pig in the cooperative very well, just like feeding their own pigs.
    Not long ago, a swine fever outbreak occurred, and the members actively injected all the pigs with vaccines and carried out comprehensive disinfection. The swine fever was quickly eradicated.
    Due to the adoption of advanced feeding management methods, Shunjiang Cooperative has greatly developed pig production. There are now one thousand publicly owned pigs, and nine pig farms have been established. In the past, the sows in the cooperative were managed in a decentralized manner, and the breeding rate was very low; now it is preparing to establish a breeding pig farm with 300 sows, so as to achieve self-breeding and self-feeding. The development of pig production has brought great benefits to the cooperative. In January this year, Shunjiang Cooperative sold seventy pigs, and at the same time accumulated more than 16,000 loads of fertilizer for the cooperative, overcoming the difficulty of fertilizer sources for topdressing spring crops.

### 要把农业合作社的猪养好

    要把农业合作社的猪养好
    这里的猪再不叫了
    徐新对
    编者按：有些农业生产合作社不会养猪，把大批的猪养瘦了，养死了。这是一个必须注意的大问题。
    农业生产合作社要想把猪养好，就要具备这样四个条件：第一要有必要的猪圈。第二要有饲料。第三要会饲养管理。第四要防止猪生病。
    当然，目前农业生产合作社要完全具备这四个条件是有困难的。但是，国家和人民又需要大量发展生猪生产。那么，应该怎么办呢？这就要严格根据本身的条件办事。能够集体喂养就集体喂养，不能集体喂养就分散喂养。只要真正作到这一点，合作社就能把猪养好，猪就不会叫了。
    二月初，浙江省平阳县灵溪区实现了高级农业合作化以后，很快又出现了高级社集体养猪的热潮。那时候，各个合作社都强调集体养猪。乡工作人员认为猪养得越多越像样，社的工作人员以为猪养得越多越光荣。对务乡新民农业生产合作社打算买一千头猪，造二百间新猪栏。于是，便在本乡和外乡大量买猪。这样一来，在短短的时间内，猪价就提高了30％以上。国家银行用大量的贷款帮助合作社买猪。
    新民农业生产合作社用三千多元的贷款，造了一百多间新猪舍，买了一百多头猪。但是，就从这个时候起出了问题！有的猪养瘦了，有的猪养死了，有的小猪给猫狸吃掉了。乱子越来越多，以后就到处听见猪叫。
    猪为什么叫呢？一是缺饲料。开始大家都指望政府供应饲料。新民农业生产合作社要求政府供应一万多斤。但是政府哪里能供应这么多的饲料呢？向上要没有，合作社只得向下要。对务乡星星社三天向社员募了两次饲料，先后募到社员的周转粮和口粮263.48斤。饲料缺，猪挨饿，自然长不大。灵溪社两窝小猪，养了两个多月，还不会吃东西。灵江乡第三社买了十头小猪，养了四十天，体重共减轻了二十二斤。对务乡上林社的母猪吃不饱，夜里跳出猪栏到田里去吃草子和小麦。社员讽刺说：我们的母猪夜里会飞哩！因为没有饲料，有六个社就死了小猪五十二头。
    二是没管好。许多社集体养的猪，都没有专人管理。有的社的饲养员缺乏养猪经验，又不负责任，结果也出了不少问题。金桥社共十二头小猪，竟给猫狸吃了十头。
    三是缺少猪栏。许多合作社把十多只猪关在一个栏里。上林农业生产合作社的社员反映：我们的母猪是吃大锅饭的，天天打架。打架就难免死亡。有许多合作社就这样亏了本。如星星社买来十二头肉猪，十五头母猪和四窝小猪，不到一个月，亏本275.5元。
    中共灵溪区委发现以上情况后，进行了深入的检查。区委认为部分农业生产合作社目前大量集体养猪的条件还没有具备，还是采取统一经营、分散饲养好。区委召开各乡支部书记会议，研究了改进养猪工作的问题。会后各乡都决定对母猪饲养实行“三包”办法：①包产量：一般是以每只母猪一年生二窝共二十头小猪计算，养六十天，包产380斤。②包饲料：每头母猪养一年，二十头小猪养六十天，给饲养户烂薯丝150斤、麦子六十斤、钱二十八元。③包工分：一头母猪养一年，给三百八十个工分。各个社并且订出奖惩制度：每窝小猪超出十头的，超产部分奖励80％；不到十头的，需负责补赏；但是遇到不可抗拒的灾害和损失的时候，不必补赏。肉猪一般都分归社员私养，养肥由社收买。只有新民社条件较好，仍旧留一部分肉猪由社集体饲养。
    为了解决饲料问题，除各个社积极发动社员多割青粗饲料外，区委还设法多供应一些米糠和杂粮。
    采用包养办法以后，情况很快就转变了。对务乡上林农业生产合作社和金桥农业生产合作社的养猪户纷纷自动去割青粗饲料。社员反映：如今我们的猪吃饱、睡暖了。蔡开尧向社里提去一只小猪十一斤重，养半个月就长了六斤半。
    先进的饲养管理方法
    顾宏民
    1954年，当四川内江县史东乡顺江农业生产合作社还是初级社的时候，就喂养了134只公有猪。那时，因为对集体养猪没有经验，管委会没有加强领导，这些猪都没有饲养好。饲养员的劳动报酬也不合理。饲养员丘学彬认为喂猪又臭又累，一天才得十分，很不满意，不好好喂养，有时一早喂了猪，等到天黑还不喂二道；猪圈很不卫生，猪身上虱子起了堆也不管。社里又没有准备足够的饲料。去年春天，有两个多月，猪天天吃不饱。每逢喂食，猪就互相咬起来，有的被咬得鲜血直流，起了茶杯大的脓泡。就这样，许多猪都长得不好。现在社里还有二十多只又瘦又弱的猪，虽然已经喂了两年，可是体重还不到50斤。有的社员讽刺说：社里喂的真是长命猪呀！
    顺江社转为高级社以后，公有猪增加了很多，改善对猪的饲养管理，更加迫切了。党支部和管理委员会研究了这个问题，并且召集饲养员座谈，让大家讨论改进饲养管理。根据大家的意见，管委会决定在养猪场内也实行包工包产办法。可是，有些饲养员有顾虑。管委会用具体事实向饲养员们说明了改进饲养管理的好处，加强了他们对养猪的责任心，并且组织他们参观了专区农场的养猪场。这样，大家的顾虑消除了。经过大家反复讨论、研究，制定了包工包产的办法：
    一、包工。根据猪的大小，活路轻重难易，确定：小猪喂满双月以后，第三个月每人喂140只；4至5月喂110只；6至7月喂95只；8至12月喂80只。这些都是一等一级活，每天记1.2个劳动日。每只猪从满双月的小猪喂到育肥期，平均得4.5个劳动日。又确定：每人喂15只母猪和一只公猪，算一等一级活，全年饲一只猪得27个劳动日。
    二、包产。要求每只肥猪全年毛重220斤，每只母猪一年产15只小猪，每只小猪到满双月，体重要达到20斤。
    三、包饲料。每只肥猪全年供给精料350斤（花生糠，米糠，菜子饼及部分粮食），粗料213斤，青料3，000斤。每只母猪给精料700斤（菜子饼，糠），粗料750斤，青料7，200斤，食盐2斤，石灰12斤；另外给燃料225斤。小猪到满双月止，每只给精料23斤，青料20斤，燃料5斤。
    包工包产制定后，饲养员们还讨论了“三奖”和“三赔”的奖惩制度。“三奖”是：第一，全年没有一只猪死亡，奖15个劳动日；第二，超额完成任务，奖超额部分的20％；提前育肥，奖缩短期间的50％的工分；第三，对有特殊成绩的管理人员和饲养员给予奖励。“三赔”是：第一，由于管理不好而发生事故使猪死亡，赔损失的30％；第二，没有完成定额指标的人，经管委会讨论，酌情赔偿；第三，管理人员和饲养员因工作失职而造成损失的时候也要赔偿。但是，如果饲养管理和防疫卫生工作做得好，因为不可抗拒的灾害而死亡的时候，饲养员不赔；由于饲料供应不及时使饲养员达不到包产定额的时候，饲养员也不赔偿。根据这个制度，分季评定，年终奖惩。
    养猪场在实行包工包产的同时，还和区农业技术指导站研究了养猪技术措施，具体地规定了喂猪定时定量、圈干、糟净、消毒隔离、定时防疫、实行母猪“双重交配”等等。
    发展生猪生产中，最难解决的是饲料问题。起初，有的社员说：喂猪没有什么巧，离了粮食喂不饱。有些社员一张嘴就向社里要玉米喂猪。管理委员会向社员们进行节约粮食、降低成本的教育，在技术站的帮助下，找出了用代食品喂猪的办法，并且向饲养员示范。第一次试验的是把花生壳用锅炒后磨成细粉，掺到饲料中，猪很喜欢吃。经过十几天以后，猪变得又黑又亮。第二次试验是把甘蔗渣浸在石灰水（用1.5斤石灰兑一百斤水）里面，十五分钟后蔗渣变得像新鲜青草一样，成了一种很好的饲料。现在，顺江社经常用的代食饲料已有50多种。合作社还建立了固定的饲料产地。饲养员们再不喊缺饲料了。
    调制饲料，改善饲料的味质，提高猪的食欲，以及利用多种多样的饲料，是降低成本获得更多产品的好办法。顺江社很注意按照猪的发育规律搭配饲料。如猪喂到五、六个月，正是长肌肉和骨胳的时候，需要多喂含有蛋白质和矿物质较多的野花生、野麦、洋姜杆、大豆壳、稻壳、菜子壳等饲料；猪长到八、九月的时候需要积蓄脂肪，要多喂含有碳水化合物较多的红薯糠等饲料；八、九月以后，正是“催肥”的时候，更需要多供应含有丰富的碳水化合物的饲料。第五养猪场饲养员张洪武采取这种办法喂猪后，架子猪每天平均长十二两肉。为了作好饲料的调制，顺江社正在建立饲料加工厂。有了加工厂，更可以提高饲料的利用率。
    在实行包工包产等办法的过程中，还加强了对饲养员的思想教育。顺江社确定一个副业股长专门负责这项工作。合作社每月召开两次饲养员会议，交流经验，互相评比。饲养员王绍五，有一个时期几天不打扫猪圈，并且偷社里的饲料，因此在会上受到了批评。张洪武工作积极负责，把猪草切得细，调制得好，把猪喂得都很肥。经过社员评定，今年二月份奖励了他三个劳动日。通过这样的教育，使饲养员们像喂自己的猪一样，把社里的每只猪喂的都很好。
    不久以前，发生了猪瘟，社员们积极给全部的猪注射了防疫针，作了全面消毒。猪瘟很快被扑灭了。
    顺江社由于采用了先进的饲养管理方法，生猪生产有了很大发展。现在有一千只公有猪，建立了九个养猪场。过去社里的母猪分散管理，饲养不好，繁殖率很低；现在正准备建立一个拥有三百只母猪的种猪场，做到自繁殖自饲养。生猪生产的发展，为合作社带来了巨大好处。今年一月份，顺江社就卖了七十只猪，同时为社积肥一万六千多挑，克服了小春作物追肥的肥源困难。
