I completely agree with and support the 1955 National Final Accounts, the 1956 National Budget, and the reports of the leading comrades.

The draft model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives discussed at this meeting, when compared with the situation in our cooperative, are completely in line with the actual conditions of our cooperative. I represent all our members in expressing our support.

The Wugong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County was converted into an advanced cooperative last winter. After the transition to the advanced cooperative, like the brother cooperatives across the country, the socialist consciousness of the members has been raised, and the enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, providing a guarantee for developing production and increasing the income of the members. Some comrades have already talked about this, so I won't repeat it. I will talk about the "Five Guarantees" situation in our cooperative.

Our cooperative has a total of 426 households with 1,711 people. When transitioning to the advanced cooperative, 363 households increased their income and were in high spirits. However, there were also 56 households with 96 people who had concerns about the abolition of land dividends after the transition to the advanced cooperative due to lack of labor or insufficient labor, especially elderly people with no labor. They were afraid that their income would decrease, their lives would be lowered, and that they would starve because they could not earn work points. Regarding this issue, all our members conducted discussions and agreed that life could be improved after the transition to the advanced cooperative, but the difficulties of old, weak, orphaned, and widowed households with no or insufficient labor must be addressed through mutual assistance, and they should enter socialism together, solve their practical difficulties, and ensure that their living standards are not lower than those of ordinary members. First, we ranked the households and people with no labor and insufficient labor, dividing them into three types. Second, we formulated solutions for each type of household and person: First, there were 5 households with 9 people who were completely dependent and had completely lost their labor force or were too young to work. Their living problems were completely covered by the cooperative, including food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial. Each person received an average subsidy of 700 catties of grain per year, totaling 6,300 catties for the 9 people. Second, there were 29 households with 59 people who were dependent, had slight labor, but were not strong. For them, work was assigned according to their specific circumstances, quotas were set, and subsidies were provided; more work, more pay, without reducing subsidies. Except for 9 households with 10 people who could solve their own living problems, 20 households with 49 people needed subsidies, and they were subsidized with 15,500 catties of grain throughout the year. Third, there were 22 households with 28 people who had children and grandchildren, but had been living separately for many years and were now unable to work or could only participate in light labor. For them, the first step was to mobilize their children and grandchildren to support them. If their children and grandchildren had poor labor or had difficulty in life and could only support part of the elderly, or were unable to support the elderly, the cooperative would subsidize the insufficient part or solve the problem according to the first category of households in difficulty. Excluding the households supported by children and grandchildren, 8 households with 10 people needed subsidies, and they were subsidized with 2,000 catties of grain this year. Because the difficulties of farmers with no labor and insufficient labor were solved, the people in our whole township were very satisfied with this matter. Especially the elderly were more satisfied. For example, the cooperative member Li Xingcai was a cripple and very old, unable to work. The cooperative provided him with grain and firewood, gave him white flour to eat when he was sick, hired a doctor to treat him, and sent people to take care of him. After his death, he was given a new set of clothes, a pair of shoes, and a coffin was bought for him. The cooperative buried him. The elderly people said: "Li Xingcai died in such a year. If it were in the past, no one would care. After death, he would just be wrapped in a piece of broken mat and buried; the current cooperative is really good, people are cared for when they are old, and buried after death, so there is peace of mind. These are all the benefits of the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

From the perspective of the "Five Guarantees" situation in our cooperative, the subsidies for these three types of people totaled 23,800 catties of grain, accounting for 13.6% of the total public welfare fund of our cooperative this year, which is 175,200 catties. Therefore, according to the provisions of the cooperative charter, it is possible for cooperatives with a foundation and high income to completely cover the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed households. In this way, the government's social relief funds can be used less or not at all, saving national expenditures to support national construction.

In addition, there is a problem that our agricultural labor models spend too much time in meetings, which affects production. Take me and Comrade Yuan Xing from our province as examples. We are both cooperative directors. This year, from January to now, besides receiving visitors to our cooperative, I only remember attending 10 days of district secretary meetings, 9 days of provincial competition meetings (including a few days of stay in the special zone), 9 days of provincial people's congresses, 7 days of meetings at the central Ministry of Agriculture, and 3 days of county people's congresses, totaling 38 days of meetings, plus 21 days of travel time for each meeting, plus more than 20 days for the National People's Congress, which is 79 days. The cadre meetings convened by the district and county have not been counted. Comrade Yuan Xing has also been in meetings for more than 70 days including travel time. In the past six months, we have participated in very little labor. Every time we return to the cooperative after a meeting, we must understand the production situation and then carry out our work. In this way, intermittent meetings make it impossible to systematically study and improve the work of the cooperative. At this meeting, I exchanged opinions with agricultural labor models from other regions, and they also felt the same way, hoping to solve this problem.

    五公乡农业生产合作社的“五保”工作
    ——耿长锁代表的发言
    我对1955年国家决算、1956年国家预算和各位首长的报告，完全同意拥护。
    这次会议讨论的高级农业生产合作社示范章程草案，和我们社的情况对照了一下，完全切合我们社的实际情况，我代表我们全体社员表示拥护。
    饶阳县五公乡农业生产合作社，是在去年冬季转入高级社的。转入高级社以后，和全国各兄弟社一样，社员的社会主义觉悟提高了，生产的劲头也大得多了，对于发展生产，增加社员收入提供了保证。这方面的情况，已经有的同志说了，我不再说，我说说我们社的五保情况吧。
    我们社共有426户，1，711人。在转入高级社的时候，有363户增加收入，情绪高涨。但是，也有56户96人因无劳力或缺乏劳力，对转入高级社取消土地分红有顾虑，特别是无劳力的老年人顾虑更大。他们怕收入减少，生活降低，怕不能劳动挣不上工分挨饿。对于这一个问题，我们全体社员进行了讨论，都认为转入高级社生活能够得到改善，但是对无劳力或缺劳力的老弱孤寡户的困难，必须进行互助，和他们一道进入社会主义，解决他们的实际困难，并且使他们的生活不能低于一般社员的生活水平。首先我们对于无劳力和缺乏劳力的户和人进行了排队，共划分了三个类型。其次，对每个类型的户和人，制定了解决困难的办法：第一、无依无靠完全丧失劳动力或年岁小不能劳动的有5户9人。对于他们的生活问题，由社保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬完全包起来，每人每年平均补助粮食700斤，9人共补助6，300斤。第二、无依无靠有轻微劳动力的s有29户59人。对他们是按照他们的具体情况，定工生产，定额补助；多劳多得，不减少补助。除去9户10人能够解决自己的生活外，有20户49人需要补助，全年补助他们15，500斤粮食。第三、是有儿有孙，但分居多年现在已经不能劳动或是只能参加轻微的劳动，这样的有22户28人。对他们首先是动员他的儿孙供养。如果他们的儿孙劳力差或生活困难只能供养一部分或无力供养老人，即由社补助他的不足部分，或按第一类困难户解决。除去儿孙供养的户数外，有8户10人需要补助，今年补助他们粮食2，000斤。由于解决了无劳力和缺劳力农户的困难，我们全乡的人民对于这个事都很满意。特别是老年人更满意。比如社员李兴才是个拐子，年岁也很大了，不能劳动，由社里供给他粮食和烧柴，病了给他白面吃，请大夫治疗，派人伺候他，死后，给他作了一套新衣、一双鞋，买了一口棺材，社里埋了他。老年人们说：“李兴才是死在这样的年头，要是过去保险没人管，死了不过用一片破席包包埋了算了；现在的社可是真好，人老有人管，死了有人埋，心里有了底。这都是共产党、毛主席领导的好处，我们感谢共产党、毛主席。”
    从我们社的“五保”情况来看，对这三类人的补助共计23，800斤粮食，占我们社今年公益金总数175，200斤的13.6％。因此，根据社章的规定，有基础的社和收入多的社，对老弱孤寡户完全包起来是可能的。这样，可以不用或少用政府的社会救济款，给国家节省开支，以支持国家的建设。
    另外，我们农业劳模因开会占用的时间过多，影响生产是个问题。就拿我和我们省元兴同志说吧，我们都是社主任，今年从一月到现在，除了接待来我社访问的以外，只我记得的，开区书会议10天，省竞赛会（包括在专区停留的几天）9天，省人民代表大会9天，在中央农业部开会7天，县人民代表大会3天，共开会38天，加上各次会议往返的时间21天，再加上20多天的全国人民代表大会，就有79天了。区、县召集的干部会还没有计算。元兴同志开会加上往返时间也有70多天。半年以来，我们参加的劳动时间很少，每次开会回社必须了解生产情况，再进行工作。这样，断断续续的开会，就不能系统地研究和改进社的工作。这次开会我和其他地区的农业劳模交换意见，他们也有这样的感觉，希望解决这个问题。
