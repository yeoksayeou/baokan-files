    Cannot be Numb, Cannot Hesitate
    Jian Hong
    This year, the sowing and rice transplanting work in various regions has been done better than in previous years. However, judging from the situations discovered in inspections in various regions, the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows is still quite common.
    Some people, seeing only the various favorable conditions at the time of sowing this year, believe that the seedling emergence situation must be fine and never think that "checking and replanting seedlings" is still needed. What is the actual situation? For example, the Xinyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, generally did a meticulous job of sowing this year. They were all convinced that this year's cotton would definitely "emerge completely and grow vigorously." However, they were all taken aback by a recent repeated and in-depth inspection: of 1,501 mu of cotton fields, 400 mu were missing 30% of the seedlings, 250 mu were missing 50% of the seedlings, 110 mu were missing 70% of the seedlings, and another 241 mu had only 10% of the seedlings. Among the 500 mu with relatively complete seedling emergence, some also had only 90% of the seedlings.
    Some people do not pay attention to "checking and replanting seedlings" because they see that there are not many missing seedlings. This is also wrong. The Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, planted 150 mu of golden melons. They originally planned to keep 600 plants per mu, but according to a recent inspection, there were only 540 plants per mu. A tenth of the seedlings are missing. If they cannot be replanted, the whole cooperative will harvest 130,000 jin less of golden melons. What a huge loss!
    After in-depth inspections and concrete calculations, some people have dispelled their complacency, but have developed various unnecessary concerns. They are afraid that the replanting now will not allow the crops to mature, afraid that the transplanted seedlings will die, and also afraid that they will not be able to replant so many seedlings in a short period of time. However, many successful experiences tell us that as long as we seize the time, are good at organizing forces, process more, apply more topdressing fertilizer, and take appropriate technical measures, we can not only ensure that the seedlings mature, but also possibly guarantee increased production. In 1954, the Xinyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, under the attack of various natural disasters, replanted seven times in a row, and finally ensured full seedling emergence and achieved a bumper harvest.
    This year, the seedling replanting work in various places has more favorable conditions than in previous years. As long as we correct various erroneous ideas and concentrate the necessary material and technical forces, it can be done completely well. After overcoming complacency, the cadres and members of the Jingyanggang Agricultural Cooperative in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, formed a seedling replanting team. In just three days, they have replanted all the missing seedlings in 1,000 mu of millet, 900 mu of sorghum, and 440 mu of cotton fields, and thoroughly watered them. After inspecting the situation of missing seedlings, the Xinyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, selected, mixed, soaked, and replanted seeds day and night. The replanted cotton has already emerged.

    不能麻痹，不能犹豫

    今年各个地区播种、插秧的工作，都比往年做得好。但是，从各个地区检查发现的情况看来，缺苗、断垅的现象还相当普遍。
    有些人仅仅看到今年播种时候的各种有利条件，就认为出苗的情况一定错不了，根本没有想到还需要进行“查苗补苗”。事实究竟怎么样呢？例如山西介休县新园农业合作社，今年的播种工作一般说来还很细致。他们都确信今年的棉花一定会“出全长旺”。可是，最近他们作了反复、深入的检查，都大吃一惊：一千五百零一亩棉田，有四百亩缺三成苗，二百五十亩缺五成苗，一百一十亩缺七成苗，另有二百四十一亩仅有一成苗。在出苗较全的五百亩中，也有一部分是九成苗。
    有些人看到缺苗不多，就不注意“查苗补苗”，这也是不对的。山东寿张县星火农业合作社种了一百五十亩金瓜。他们原计划每亩留六百棵，但是据最近检查，每亩仅有五百四十棵。缺苗十分之一，如果不能补齐，就要使全社少收十三万斤金瓜。这是多么巨大的损失！
    有些人在深入的检查和具体的算账以后，麻痹思想是打消了，但是又发生了种种不必要的顾虑。他们害怕现在补种下去成熟不了，害怕移苗移死了，还怕不能在很短时间以内补起那么多的苗。但是，许多成功的经验告诉我们，只要抓紧时间，善于组织力量，多加工，多追肥，并且采取适当的技术措施，不但可以保证苗子成熟，并且可能保证增产。1954年，山西介休县新园农业合作社在各种自然灾害袭击下，连续补种了七次，终于保证了全苗，取得了丰收。
    今年各地进行补苗工作，比往年具有更多的有利条件。只要纠正各种错误的想法，集中必要的物力和技术力量，是完全可以做好的。山东寿张县景阳岗农业合作社的干部、社员克服了麻痹思想以后，组成补苗大队，仅仅三天工夫，已经把一千亩谷子、九百亩高粱、四百四十亩棉花田中缺的苗子全部补齐，进行了透浇。山西介休县新园农业生产合作社检查缺苗情况后，不分昼夜地选种拌种，浸种，补种，现在补种的棉花已经出苗。
