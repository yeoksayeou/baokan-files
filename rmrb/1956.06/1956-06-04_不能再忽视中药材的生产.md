The Production of Chinese Herbal Medicine Can No Longer Be Ignored
Yao Dan

Sichuan Province is the most important producing area of Chinese herbal medicine in the country. The province produces more than 450 kinds of medicinal materials, and more than 800 kinds including herbal medicines. Among them, more than 100 kinds, such as Chuan芎 (Ligusticum wallichii), Coptis chinensis, and Gardenia jasminoides, are commonly used in Chinese medicine prescriptions and are transported in large quantities from the province to various places at home and abroad every year.

However, in the past year or so, the production of many medicinal materials in Sichuan Province has declined, and there has been a general shortage or tight supply in the market. From the second quarter of this year to the present, the number of medicinal materials that are generally out of stock and in short supply throughout the province has increased from dozens last year to more than 130. In Chongqing County, the number of medicines out of stock has reached more than 250. It has become very common for pharmacies to return prescriptions to patients because they cannot fill them. Even the largest pharmacies in Chengdu, the province's most complete Chinese herbal medicine market, have returned ten or twenty prescriptions in a single day. More than a dozen children in a cooperative in Guangyuan County fell ill and could not buy the urgently needed medicines locally. It can be seen how seriously the decline in the production of Chinese herbal medicines affects people's health.

There are many reasons for the decline in the production of Chinese herbal medicines. First of all, the production has not received enough attention from the leading organs. In many areas, no one cares about the production of Chinese herbal medicines, and many medicinal materials are not included in the national plan at all. The phenomenon of local rural staff discriminating against and restricting farmers who produce Chinese herbal medicines is everywhere. A farmer in Deyang County planted more than one mu of white peony. In order to strive to join the cooperative, he plowed up all the white peony. Some farmers in Mianzhu County were afraid that the staff would criticize them as "bourgeois," so they were forced to pour Angelica sinensis seedlings into the latrine and never planted medicine again. Originally, planting medicinal materials requires more labor and financial resources than growing crops. Some family-grown medicinal materials take five or six years to mature and require more fertilizer and certain techniques; farmers who go to the mountains to collect medicines often have to carry dry food and climb mountains and wade through water for a long time, living in remote mountains and old forests for dozens of days or months. For example, Coptis chinensis, a kind of medicinal material that grows on cliffs in Emei County, needs to be collected by risking life and limb, hanging down with dozens of feet of rope. However, instead of giving more support, help, and technical guidance to those who plant and collect medicine, many places create difficulties and suppress them. Some even stipulate that people who plant medicine will not be issued grain purchase certificates, fertilizers will not be allocated, and assistance will not be provided to solve the difficulties of seed and tool shortages. In many places, cooperatives do not include medicinal materials in the planning of land and labor, or the work points for medicinal material collection are rated lower than the work points earned from general field labor. In Damu Township, a cooperative used to have thirty or forty households going to the mountains to collect medicine, but now no one goes because the work points are low. In some townships in Tongliang and Yongchuan counties, there have always been dozens of people specializing in collecting more than sixty kinds of medicines such as Gardenia jasminoides and Lycium chinense, but now these products have disappeared from the market. According to statistics from seven counties in the Fuling area, there are more than 90 kinds of medicinal materials that have been reduced in production. In Nanchuan, Coptis chinensis and in Fuling, Angelica dahurica have historically produced dozens of dan per year, but this year they are almost completely out of production.

Since local governments have not taken specific measures to protect and cultivate wild medicinal materials, farmers have been digging and collecting them indiscriminately, and the output of some medicinal materials has begun to decline or become extinct year by year. For example, musk, a famous export medicinal material, used to be hunted as soon as the musk deer was seen (both female deer and young deer had musk), and often three or four hundred musk deer were killed, but only one hundred had musk. Xiushan County used to collect one hundred and dozens taels of musk every year, but in the first quarter of this year's peak production season, only more than ten taels were collected. Many important medicinal materials that supply the whole country or are exported, such as Dipsacus asperoides and Polygonatum sibiricum, have been collected or are about to be collected in some counties!

The capitalist management ideology of the departments that manage Chinese herbal medicines has also contributed to the decline and shortage of Chinese herbal medicines. For example, it is common for various places to only want to manage large, easy-to-store, and fast-selling medicinal materials, and not want to manage medium and small medicinal materials, because medium and small medicinal materials are not easy to store, the profits are not large, and the sales are not wide. Therefore, although there are more than 450 kinds of medicinal materials produced in the province, the medicinal material purchasing departments only manage more than 300 kinds, and some areas manage even fewer. Guangyuan County produces more than 200 kinds of Chinese herbal medicines, but now only more than 80 kinds are purchased; Jiangjin County produces more than 120 kinds, but only more than 50 kinds are purchased. The characteristic of Chinese medicine is multiple prescriptions, and one disease requires dozens of medicines, especially medium and small medicines, which are widely used common medicines. Without actively purchasing medium and small medicines, it is impossible to guarantee medical needs. For example, Lophatherum gracile is the cheapest medicine, but it is widely used. Last spring, when colds were prevalent, a large amount of Lophatherum gracile was needed, but it could not be bought anywhere in Chengdu. Fengdu County produces Lycium chinense and Asarum heterotropoides, but because they are not purchased locally, they are instead out of stock. Last summer, Chengdu was short of Plantago asiatica, a medicine for treating dysentery, but some farmers in Renshou and other places could not sell Plantago asiatica to supply and marketing cooperatives.

Many Chinese herbal medicine management institutions have arbitrarily formulated various "strict rules and regulations" to restrict the purchase of medium and small medicinal materials. Some places, regardless of the sporadic and scattered nature of Chinese herbal medicine production, also stipulate that peach kernels, tangerine peels, and other medium and small medicinal materials that need to be collected bit by bit must be purchased in quantities of three to five catties or more; some places purchase them sometimes and sometimes not, sometimes mobilizing the masses to produce a lot, and then suddenly stop purchasing when the masses produce them. Some places also stipulate that unprocessed fresh goods will not be accepted, and they will not be accepted unless they are sold at the market. Farmers who are engaged in the production of Chinese herbal medicines often walk a long way to deliver the medicinal materials to the purchasing organs, but the purchasing organs refuse to purchase them. Some farmers were so angry that they dumped the medicinal materials or burned them on the spot, indicating that they would never produce medicinal materials again.

In terms of purchase prices, they often do not consider promoting production and guaranteeing needs, but only consider the operating interests at the time: if sales are good, the price is raised, and if sales are not good, the price is lowered below the production cost. For example, the production cost of Angelica dahurica is about ten yuan per dan. In 1953, the average purchase price was twenty yuan per dan. In 1954, because there was a lot of backlog, the purchase price was reduced to seven or eight yuan. In 1955, Angelica dahurica was generally out of stock because of this. The normal purchase price of Carthamus tinctorius in Yongchuan County should be 200 yuan per dan, but the purchasing department actually only gave 104 yuan. As a result, the output of Carthamus tinctorius dropped from more than 20,000 jin to about 500 jin. The purchase price of Nepeta cataria in Zitong County was too low last year, and the farmers burned more than 2,000 jin of production as firewood. Plants such as Chaenomeles speciosa and Poncirus trifoliata, which are currently out of stock, are perennial woody plants. Because the purchase prices were too low in the past, farmers cut down the trees. Now they have to be replanted, and it will take seven or eight years before medicinal materials can be harvested.

In addition, untimely allocation of supplies and too high starting points for wholesale have also artificially exacerbated the tension in the supply of Chinese herbal medicines.

The serious problems in both production and purchase and sales indicate that there is still a lack of active leadership and comprehensive planning for the production and management of Chinese herbal medicines. This is the fundamental reason for the decline in the production of Chinese herbal medicines in Sichuan Province in the past year or so.

Obviously, this problem cannot be allowed to continue to be ignored. Recently, Sichuan Province has begun to solve this problem. In addition to holding Chinese herbal medicine symposiums in various places to inspect the problems in production and management, it has also held a Sichuan Provincial Chinese Herbal Medicine Professional Conference with the participation of staff from agriculture, forestry, commerce, health, medicine and other departments. The departments have a clearer understanding of the great political significance of Chinese herbal medicines in relation to people's health and the policies and policies of Chinese herbal medicine production and management. The conference also formulated a plan for the production of Chinese herbal medicines and identified some specific measures to ensure the development of Chinese herbal medicine production and the improvement of Chinese herbal medicine management.

    不能再忽视中药材的生产
    姚丹
    四川省是全国最重要的中药材产区，全省共产各种药材四百五十多种，算上草药共有八百多种，其中像川芎、黄连、?子等一百多种，是中药配方中的常用药，每年都要由省内大量运往国内外各地。
    可是最近一年多来，四川省的许多药材都减产了，市场上普遍出现脱销或供应紧张的现象。从今年第二季度开始到目前，全省普遍脱销和供应紧张的药材已经由去年的几十种增加到一百三十多种，崇庆县脱销药品竟达到二百五十多种。药铺因为配不齐药，把药单退还病人，已经成为极平常的事情。连全省中药材最为齐全的成都市的几家最大药铺，也曾发生一天退掉一、二十张药单的情况。广元县一个合作社内十多个小孩得了病，都不能在当地买到急需的药材。可见，中药材减产，是怎样严重地影响了人民的健康。
    中药材减产的原因是多方面的。首先是在生产上没有得到领导机关的重视。许多地区中药材的生产无人过问，许多药材根本没有列入国家计划。各地乡村工作人员歧视、限制生产中药材的农民的现象到处都有。德阳县有一个农民种了一亩多白芍，为了争取入社，竟把白芍全部犁掉。绵竹县有的农民怕工作人员批评是“资产阶级”，被迫竟把当归苗倒在毛坑里，再也不种药了。本来，种药材比种庄稼要花费更多的劳力和财力。有些家种药材要五六年才成熟，需要更多的肥料和一定的技术；农民上山挖药，往往还要带着干粮，长期爬山涉水，去到人迹绝少的深山老林中住上几十天或者几个月。像峨眉县的朱砂莲是长在悬岩绝壁上的一种药材，需要冒着生命危险，用几十丈绳子吊着下去采集。但是，很多地方对于种药和挖药的人不是给以更多的扶持、帮助和技术上的指导，而是刁难、打击。有的甚至规定不给种药的人发购粮证，不配给肥料，不帮助解决种籽、工具缺乏的困难。很多地方的合作社在土地和劳动力的规划中都不将药材规划进去，或者将采药工分评得低于一般田间劳动所得的工分。大木乡有个合作社过去原有三、四十户人上山挖药，因为工分低，现在一户也不去挖了。铜梁、永川两县的一些乡历来都有几十个人专采黄枝子、地骨皮等六十多种药，现在这些产品已经在市场上绝迹。据涪陵专区七个县统计，减产的药材即有九十多种，南川的黄连，涪陵的白芷历来年产几十石，可是今年几乎绝产了。
    由于各地政府对于野生药材没采取具体措施加以保护和培育，农民乱挖乱采，有一些药材的产量已经开始逐年下降或者绝产。例如著名的出口药材麝香，过去对产麝香的獐子见着就打（母獐子和小獐子都没有麝），往往打死三、四百只獐子，才有一百只有麝香的。秀山县过去每年都收麝香一百几十两，在今年生产旺季的第一季度只收了十多两。续断、黄精等许多供应全国或出口的重要药材，在有的县份已经采尽或快要采尽了！
    经营中药材的部门有资本主义经营思想，也促使了中药材的减产和脱销。例如各地普遍出现只愿经营大宗的、好保管的、畅销的药材，不愿经营中、小药材，理由是中、小药材不好保管，获利也不大，销路不广。因此，全省所产药材虽然有四百五十多种，收购药材部门经营的却只有三百多种，有些地区经营得更少。广元县产中药材二百多种，现在只收购八十多种；江津县产一百二十多种，只收购五十多种。中药的特点就是多种配方，一种病就需要服几十味药，特别是中、小药材大都是广泛应用的常用药品。不积极收购中小药材，根本无法保证医疗的需要。例如，淡竹叶是价钱最贱的药，但是它的应用很广泛。去年春季，感冒流行，大量需要淡竹叶，在成都却到处买不到。酆都县产枸?、士辛等药材，但是因为当地不收购，反而脱销。去年夏季，成都到处缺乏医治痢疾的车钱仁，而仁寿等地有的农民把车钱仁背到供销合作社却卖不掉。
    许多中药材经营机构，擅自订出各种“清规戒律”，限制中、小药材的收购。有的地方不顾中药材生产零星、分散的特点，对桃仁、陈皮等需要一点一滴收集的中、小药材，也规定必须三斤五斤以上才收购；有的地方时收时不收，有时发动群众大量生产，当群众生产出来了，又猛然停止收购。有些地方还规定，没有加过工的鲜货不收，不逢场不收。从事中药材生产的农民，常常走了很多路把药材送到收购机关，收购机关竟拒绝收购。有的农民气得把药材倒掉，或当场烧毁，表示决不再生产药材。
    在收购价格方面，往往不从促进生产和保证需要上考虑，而仅从当时经营利益上考虑：销路好，就把价格抬高，销路不好，就把价格压低到生产成本以下。像白芷，每石生产成本约十元，1953年平均每石收购价是二十元，1954年因为积压很多，就把收购价降低到七、八元，1955年白芷就因此普遍脱销了。永川县的红花，每石正常收购价应该是二百元，收购部门实际上只给一百零四元。因此红花的产量即由二万多斤降到五百来斤。梓潼县的荆芥，去年收购价太低，农民把生产出的二千多斤都当柴烧了。像当前脱销的木瓜、枳壳等多年生木本植物，由于过去收购价格太低，农民把树子砍掉了，现在要从新栽培，到七、八年后才能采取药材。
    此外，供应上调拨的不及时，批发起点太高等，也人为地加剧了中药材供应上的紧张现象。
    无论生产上或购销上的严重问题，说明了对于中药材的生产和经营都还缺乏积极的领导和全面的规划。这就是一年多来四川省中药材生产下降的根本原因。
    显然，这一问题是不能容许继续被忽视了。最近，四川省已经开始着手解决这个问题，除在各地召开中药材座谈会，检查生产和经营中的问题以外；又召开了有农业、林业、商业、卫生、医药等部门的工作人员参加的四川省中药材专业会议，使各部门对于中药材关系人民健康的重大政治意义和中药材生产、经营的方针政策，有了比较明确的认识，这次会议还拟订了中药材生产的规划，确定了一些具体措施，以便保证中药材生产的发展和中药材经营的改进。
