Regarding the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Struggle and the Handling of Japanese War Criminals Detained in China
-- Speech by Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate

    I fully agree with the "1955 National Final Accounts and 1956 National Budget (Draft)" and the "Model Charter (Draft) of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives" submitted to this conference for deliberation, as well as the reports and explanations made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Minister Liao Luyan regarding the above two documents. I also fully agree with the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress" made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle and the handling of Japanese war criminals detained in our country. We have achieved great victories on the front of suppressing counter-revolutionaries
    In the period between the Second and Third Sessions of the First National People's Congress, with the decisive victory of the socialist cause and the fundamental changes in the domestic political situation, we have also achieved great victories on the front of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
    1955 was a year when China entered a high tide of socialism. In the winter of 1954 and the first half of 1955, counter-revolutionaries carried out rampant sabotage activities against the agricultural cooperativization movement, the unified purchase and sale of agricultural products, and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In response to this situation at the time, at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, many representatives put forward proposals to continue to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and the "Resolution on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" adopted at the meeting stipulated the task of strengthening the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. People's Procuratorates at all levels resolutely implemented the resolutions of the National People's Congress and the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and, in coordination with public security organs and people's courts, launched a struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, arresting and punishing counter-revolutionaries and other criminals who undermined socialist construction and socialist transformation. This gave the remaining counter-revolutionary forces another heavy blow, further weakening the remaining counter-revolutionary forces and making their activities more difficult. Moreover, due to the implementation of the policy of combining suppression with leniency in the struggle, new situations and changes have emerged in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The internal division and disintegration of counter-revolutionaries have greatly increased, and a large number of counter-revolutionaries have surrendered to the government. Therefore, the number of criminal cases in many areas has greatly decreased since last winter. According to statistics from 11 provinces and cities, including Sichuan, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the number of criminal cases occurring in the first quarter of 1956 decreased by 33.7% compared with the same period last year. In Liaoning Province, the number of criminal cases in the fourth quarter of last year decreased by 35% compared with the third quarter, and the number of criminal cases in January and February of this year decreased by another 34% compared with November and December of last year. The victory in the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle has further consolidated social order and played a powerful guaranteeing and promoting role in ensuring the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    This new situation of internal division and disintegration of counter-revolutionaries began in the winter of 1955, and after the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), it developed more rapidly and widely throughout the country. In Lingling County, Hunan Province, after a conference to promote the National Agricultural Development Program, 46 counter-revolutionaries and other criminals surrendered, handing over four pistols, nine hand grenades, and other reactionary documents. In Tianjin, from July 1955 to March 1956, 560 counter-revolutionaries surrendered. After the city leniently handled a group of surrendered elements on May 31 this year, 55 important counter-revolutionaries surrendered to the government within three days. Among the surrendered counter-revolutionaries, many were counter-revolutionaries with serious crimes and deep concealment, as well as U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and spies. Zhang Yi, a special agent of the "Shanghai District Special Commissioner" sent by the Kuomintang "Central Committee Second Group," sneaked into the mainland on February 8 this year. Because he was closely guarded by the masses everywhere, saw the new atmosphere of socialist construction in the motherland, and was inspired by the lenient policy, he surrendered to the government on February 16 and exposed many counter-revolutionaries. After lenient handling by the Hangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate, he was exempted from prosecution and was given a reward and employment by relevant departments. Xu Guozuo, a counter-revolutionary in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, who had accepted the task of the special agent organization "Kuomintang Reconstruction Committee" and had been lying dormant for five years, also surrendered in this suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle. At present, the situation of counter-revolutionaries dividing, wavering, disintegrating, repenting, and turning over a new leaf is developing day by day, which creates extremely favorable conditions for further deepening the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle and thoroughly eliminating all counter-revolutionaries.
    This favorable situation in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not an isolated and accidental occurrence. It is related to the fundamental changes in China's domestic political situation and has arisen through serious struggles with counter-revolutionaries. Since the second half of 1955, the socialist cause has achieved a decisive victory, the social foundation of counter-revolution has been greatly weakened, and China's people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated. Moreover, due to the strength of the world's peace forces, the U.S. imperialist war preparation policy has been met with increasingly strong opposition from the people of all countries, and the international tension has eased, the U.S. war-mongering clique has become increasingly isolated, which has completely shattered the counter-revolutionary restoration fantasies that many counter-revolutionaries had placed in the past. At the same time, the thriving development of our country's construction cause and the bright prospects of socialism cannot but have a significant impact on counter-revolutionaries, and they cannot but reconsider their future. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1955 gave the counter-revolutionaries a very heavy blow. In the face of the power of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the continuous improvement of the political consciousness and organizational level of the people of the whole country, counter-revolutionaries were subjected to increasing threats. And our policy of combining suppression with leniency towards counter-revolutionaries and the provisions of Article 5 of the National Agricultural Development Program pointed out a bright future for counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, a large number of counter-revolutionaries surrendered. Ling Yun, a counter-revolutionary in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, who participated in the special agent organization "Jiangxi Province Second District Party and Government Committee," said when he surrendered: "Seeing the armistice in Korea and Vietnam, I knew there was no hope. Hearing that we were going to continue suppressing counter-revolutionaries, I felt uneasy. Seeing President Dong Biwu's report at the CPPCC meeting, I wavered. Seeing the National Agricultural Development Program, I felt there was indeed a way out, so I decided to surrender." Li Guangquan, a counter-revolutionary in Shenyang City, fled from Northeast China to Inner Mongolia. His brother-in-law's daughter-in-law reported him, and he fled back to his home and hid in the warehouse. After the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) was published, his grandson wanted to report him again, scaring him to run to his friend's house, and his friend read him the news published in the newspaper about the handling of surrendered elements. Finally, he felt he had no choice but to surrender. Obviously, if the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle had not given the enemy a heavy blow, if the counter-revolutionaries had not felt that they had nowhere to go in the people's net, the counter-revolutionaries would not have automatically laid down their arms and surrendered to the people.
    Facts have proved that in 1955, based on the assessment of the situation at the time, it was entirely necessary and correct to take resolute measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries and launch a nationwide struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries in a timely manner. If we had tolerated the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, our socialist cause would have inevitably suffered serious harm.
    The development of the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle is healthy, because this struggle is carried out in accordance with the principle of "raise vigilance, eliminate all special agents; prevent deviations, do not wrong a good person" as instructed by Chairman Mao, and correctly implement various policies towards counter-revolutionaries, extensively mobilize the masses, so that the work of special organs is coordinated and supported by the struggle of the masses. At the same time, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1955 was carried out under the increasingly complete legal system of our country. The arrest, prosecution, and trial of offenders all complied with the procedures stipulated by law, and the roles of public security, procuratorial, and court departments were brought into play, thereby preventing the phenomenon of wrongful arrest and wrongful judgment to a great extent and protecting the democratic rights of the people. However, some shortcomings and errors have also occurred in the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle, and in some places, they were even relatively serious for a certain period of time. Before the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle was launched in the first half of 1955, there was a relatively widespread right-leaning paralysis phenomenon of not punishing counter-revolutionaries severely, that is, giving light sentences for serious crimes. After the struggle was fully launched, under the high angry emotions of the masses towards counter-revolutionaries, in some places, due to the leadership not being tightly controlled and the policy boundaries not being clearly explained, some rough phenomena in the work occurred. Some people who could have been arrested or not arrested were arrested, or some people who had committed crimes but could be given lenient treatment were punished, and even some individual cases of wrongful arrest and wrongful judgment occurred. Although this only accounted for a very small number of cases handled, and has been corrected and is continuing to be prevented and corrected, the adverse consequences caused by the occurrence of wrong cases are serious and worthy of our deep vigilance. People's procuratorates at all levels and relevant departments have grasped the review of cases, and after discovering cases of wrongful arrest and wrongful judgment, they have corrected them seriously, conscientiously, and realistically in the spirit of correcting mistakes whenever they are found, and have summarized experiences and educated cadres. In the future, we must improve the policy and legal level of cadres, improve the ideological style of cadres, and conscientiously abide by legal procedures in our work to effectively prevent the occurrence of wrong cases.
    In the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle, people's procuratorates at all levels actively carried out the work of reviewing and approving the arrest of criminals and the prosecution of criminal cases, promptly arrested counter-revolutionaries and other criminals who should be arrested, filed public prosecutions according to law, and handed them over for trial; and through investigation supervision and trial supervision, prevented and corrected some cases of wrongful arrest and wrongful judgment, and protected the democratic rights of the people. After a year of construction, the organizational and business foundation of people's procuratorates at all levels has been strengthened compared with the past, and at present, procuratorial organs at all levels have been basically and universally established. In terms of business, it has also laid the foundation for improving the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases, and has created conditions for further carrying out other procuratorial businesses. However, because the organizational structure of people's procuratorates at all levels was still in the process of being established and improved in 1955, and because there was still right-leaning conservative thinking in the construction of our procuratorial work, the development of the organization and business of the procuratorial organs has not kept up with the needs of the work. At the same time, due to insufficient political and ideological leadership, some procuratorial cadres still lack the necessary principles and firmness in fighting against illegal and criminal phenomena, and have failed to conscientiously exercise their procuratorial powers and fully play the role of procuratorial work. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly improve the procuratorial organization and procuratorial system, and effectively overcome the shortcomings and errors in the work, so as to do the work better.
    We should sufficiently estimate that the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been greatly weakened and have been divided and disintegrated, but we must not think that there are no more counter-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and we can sit back and relax. After the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle, the number of remaining counter-revolutionaries has been further reduced, and it has become more difficult for them to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, but they have not been completely eliminated. U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan will still use every gap to send special agents and spies to sabotage us. Our country is still in a transitional period, and there are still classes and class struggle. Therefore, we still have serious tasks of struggle in front of us, and we must not relax our vigilance and struggle. More deeply launch the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other criminals
    At present, our task on the front of suppressing counter-revolutionary struggle is to use the current favorable situation and conditions to launch a more in-depth struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, and thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. In the future, the focus of the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle will be to crack down on those counter-revolutionaries who are engaged in current sabotage activities, and to crack down on special agents and spies sent by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. For historical counter-revolutionaries, we should focus on cracking down on those who have committed serious crimes, who are very unpopular with the people, and who refuse to confess. For those who have only committed general counter-revolutionary crimes in history, have confessed, and have not engaged in sabotage activities since liberation, they can be treated leniently and exempted from prosecution. Our policy towards counter-revolutionaries has always been a policy of combining suppression with leniency, that is, the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, offsetting crimes with meritorious service, and rewarding major meritorious service," giving counter-revolutionaries the opportunity to repent and turn over a new leaf and start a new life. All those who sincerely confess and are verified will be given lenient treatment, the lighter ones can be exempted from punishment, those who should be sentenced to severe punishment can be given reduced sentences, and even those who should be sentenced to death can be exempted from the death penalty. For counter-revolutionaries who not only sincerely confess themselves but also have meritorious service, their merits will offset their crimes and they will be exempted from criminal punishment; those who have made major contributions will be rewarded. This lenient policy applies not only to counter-revolutionaries who have committed general crimes, but also to counter-revolutionaries who have committed major crimes; not only to counter-revolutionaries who have committed historical crimes, but also to special agents and spies who have been sent to lie dormant. All counter-revolutionaries can receive the lenient treatment they deserve as long as they sincerely confess and surrender. At the same time, we will give opportunities for labor production to those who sincerely repent and turn over a new leaf and are willing to transform themselves in labor. In the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), provisions have been made for counter-revolutionaries to participate in agricultural production, and this is already being done in the agricultural cooperativization movement in various places. Some counter-revolutionaries have already joined agricultural cooperatives and embarked on a new path in life. We want to transform all counter-revolutionaries who can be transformed into self-reliant citizens, so that they can participate in socialist construction and enter socialist society with the people of the whole country. This is a fundamental policy of ours towards counter-revolutionaries, and it is in line with our fundamental purpose of transforming society and building a socialist society where everyone is happy. However, there will inevitably be some counter-revolutionaries who are incorrigible and will resolutely resist and be enemies of the people to the end. They will inevitably continue to sabotage our socialist cause. These counter-revolutionaries must be resolutely arrested and severely punished according to law. Further improve the people's democratic legal system
    With the development of the socialist cause and the victory of the suppression of counter-revolutionary struggle, there is an urgent need to further improve the people's democratic legal system. At present, the open and exposed remaining counter-revolutionaries have been basically eliminated. In the future, the methods of sabotage activities of hidden counter-revolutionaries will be more concealed and insidious, and they will fight against us with double-dealing tactics and "legal" forms. Therefore, in order to effectively and accurately crack down on all counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, and to protect the democratic rights of the people, it is even more necessary to implement a complete legal system and conduct the investigation and trial of criminal cases in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law. An important aspect of strengthening the people's democratic legal system at present is to strengthen procuratorial organs and improve the procuratorial system, because procuratorial work is still a relatively weak link in the country's legal system. On the basis of the basically universal establishment of procuratorial organs, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the organizational construction of procuratorial organs, supplement, cultivate, and train procuratorial cadres, and improve procuratorial organs at all levels. And quickly improve procuratorial business, so that people's procuratorates at all levels can effectively undertake the tasks of investigation and prosecution of criminal cases, in order to effectively pursue all criminals, and to more effectively supervise whether investigation activities and trial activities are legal, and to fully play the role of mutual cooperation and mutual restriction among the three departments of public security, procuratorate, and court, and to prevent and overcome the shortcomings and errors in investigation and trial work from the legal system. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of whether the staff of state organs abide by the law, resolutely fight against any violations of the law such as abuse of power and embezzlement, ensure the correct implementation of the law, and consolidate the legal system in state work. We must make the legal system of our country powerful enough so that all insidious and cunning criminals cannot escape the punishment of the law; at the same time, we must use the country's legal system to protect the rights of the people, so that no innocent person suffers illegal arrest and trial. The higher the prestige of the national legal system among the people, the more the rights of the people can be protected by the national law, the more the enthusiasm of the people to build socialism and the initiative to care about national affairs will be promoted, and the foundation of the people's democratic system will be more consolidated. Regarding the handling of Japanese war criminals detained in our country
    Finally, I would like to talk about the handling of Japanese war criminals detained in our country, which is a matter of great concern to the people of the whole country. Most of the war criminals in the Japanese war of aggression against China, including some of the main war criminals, were dealt with by the Far East International Military Tribunal and the then Chinese government after Japan surrendered. The Japanese war criminals currently detained in our country are a relatively minor part of the Japanese war criminals. Some of them were arrested by our country, a total of one hundred and forty people. Some of them participated in the counter-revolutionary civil war of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan after Japan surrendered, and were arrested by the People's Liberation Army in 1948 and 1949. Another part was war criminals who committed crimes in our country and were captured by the Soviet army in 1945, and were transferred to our country by the Soviet government in July 1950. This part totaled 969 people. Forty-seven of the above-mentioned war criminals have died in the past few years, and there are currently 1,062 Japanese war criminals in custody. The Supreme People's Procuratorate has conducted long-term investigation work on these war criminals in custody, collected sufficient evidence from all aspects, and interrogated each criminal. Because the crime locations of these war criminals were all over the areas of the country that had been occupied, and a long time had passed since the war, it was necessary to carry out a lot of work and a considerable amount of time to find out their crimes. Therefore, the investigation work was only recently completed. After investigation and verification, these war criminals violated the norms of international law and humanitarian principles during the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against our country and committed various crimes against our people. However, except for a small number of them who committed serious crimes, most of the others were secondary war criminals who committed general crimes in the course of the Japanese war of aggression, and some of them were driven by Japanese imperialism to participate in the war of aggression and committed crimes under the orders and instructions of their superiors. At the same time, because they have been influenced by the education of opposing war and safeguarding peace and the humanitarian treatment during their detention, and because they have seen the increasing strength of the world's peace forces and the suffering of the Japanese people under the U.S. military occupation after the war, most of them have shown varying degrees of remorse. Based on these circumstances, and in view of the changes in the situation and the current situation ten years after Japan's surrender, and in view of the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples in recent years, the "Decision on Handling Japanese War Criminals Detained in China in the War of Aggression Against China" of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided to give appropriate treatment to these war criminals separately in accordance with the policy of leniency. In accordance with the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Procuratorate has filed public prosecutions with the Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court for Japanese war criminals who have committed serious crimes, and is conducting trials. For the majority of Japanese war criminals who are secondary or have shown better remorse, they will be treated leniently and exempted from prosecution. The Chinese Red Cross will assist them in returning to Japan.
    The Chinese people have suffered the longest and deepest pain from the Japanese militarist aggression. During the fourteen years from the "September 18th" Incident in 1931 to the surrender of Japanese imperialism in 1945, the Chinese people endured deep suffering and suffered huge losses of life and property under the bloody aggression of Japanese militarism. Punishing Japanese war criminals is the just demand and solemn right of the Chinese people. Now, our country, based on the current international and domestic situation, and based on the circumstances of the crimes and the performance during detention of the Japanese war criminals in custody, has made a solemn and lenient treatment of these Japanese war criminals, punishing the extremely small number of criminals who have committed serious crimes according to law, and pardoning the majority of those who can be pardoned. This treatment is fully in line with the long-term interests of our people, and is conducive to the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and to consolidating lasting peace in the Far East and the world. This fully demonstrates the spirit of generosity of the Chinese people, and can also demonstrate the strength of the Chinese people and the strength of the world's peace forces, and demonstrates a high degree of confidence in easing international tensions and consolidating world peace. Therefore, we believe that this measure of ours will surely be warmly supported by the people of our country, and will also be sympathized by the Japanese people and the peace-loving people of the world.

    关于镇压反革命斗争问题和处理拘押在我国的日本战争犯罪分子问题
    ——最高人民检察院张鼎丞检察长的发言
    我完全同意提交这次大会审议的“1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算（草案）”和“高级农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”，以及李先念副总理和廖鲁言部长关于上述两个文件的报告和说明，我并完全同意彭真副委员长所作的“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”。现在，我想就镇压反革命斗争的问题和处理拘押在我国的日本战争犯罪分子的问题，发表一些意见。我们在镇压反革命战线上取得了伟大的胜利
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议至第三次会议这将近一年的时间中，随着社会主义事业取得决定性的胜利，随着国内政治形势的根本变化，我们在镇压反革命的战线上也取得了伟大的胜利。
    1955年，是我国进入社会主义高潮的一年。在1954年冬和1955年上半年，反革命分子对农业合作化运动、农产品统购统销工作和资本主义工商业改造工作，进行了猖狂的破坏活动。针对着当时的这一情况，在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，许多代表提出了继续肃清反革命分子的提案，并在会议通过的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的决议”中规定了加强镇压反革命的任务。各级人民检察院坚决地执行了全国人民代表大会的决议和中共中央关于镇压反革命的指示，协同公安机关和人民法院开展了镇压反革命的斗争，逮捕和法办了破坏社会主义建设和社会主义改造的反革命分子和其他犯罪分子，给了残余反革命势力又一次沉重的打击，使残余反革命势力更加削弱，活动更加困难。并且由于在斗争中贯彻执行了镇压与宽大相结合的政策，使镇压反革命的斗争出现了新的情况和变化，反革命分子内部发生了很大的分化瓦解，大量的反革命分子向政府投案自首。因此，去年冬季以来许多地区的刑事案件都有很大的下降，据四川、河南、山西、陕西、甘肃、浙江、广西、黑龙江、北京、天津、上海等11个省市的统计，1956年第一季发生的刑事案件较去年同期下降了33.7％。辽宁省去年第四季度发生的刑事案件较第三季度下降35％，今年一、二月份的刑事案件又较去年十一、十二月份下降34％。镇压反革命斗争的胜利进一步巩固了社会秩序，对于保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，起了有力的保障和促进的作用。
    反革命分子内部这种新的分化瓦解的情况，是从1955年冬季就已开始的，到全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布后，就在全国范围内更迅速地广泛地发展起来。湖南省零陵县在一次宣传农业发展纲要的大会后，便有46名反革命分子和其他犯罪分子投案自首，并交出手枪四支，手榴弹九枚及其他反动证件。天津市自1955年7月至1956年3月投案自首的反革命分子就有560名，该市在今年5月31日宽大处理了一批投案自首分子后，在三天内就有55名重要反革命分子向政府投案自首。在投案自首的反革命分子中，有不少是罪恶严重、隐蔽较深的反革命分子，以及美蒋特务间谍分子。国民党“中央委员会第二组”派遣进来的“上海区特派员”特务分子张毅，于今年2月8日潜入大陆后，由于到处受到群众的严密防范，由于看到了祖国社会主义建设的新气象和受到宽大政策的感召，即于2月16日向政府投案自首，并检举了反革命分子多名。经杭州市人民检察院宽大处理，免予起诉，并由有关部门给予奖励，安置了工作。浙江省温州市反革命分子徐国佐，接受特务组织“国民党改造委员会”的任务，潜伏下来已有五年之久，也于这次镇压反革命斗争中投案自首了。目前，反革命分子分化、动摇、瓦解、悔罪自新的情况正在日益发展着，这就给进一步深入镇压反革命的斗争，彻底肃清一切反革命分子创造了极为有利的条件。
    镇压反革命斗争的这种有利的情况，不是孤立地偶然地产生的，它是同我国国内政治形势发生了根本变化相关联的，并且是经过了同反革命分子的严重斗争而产生的。1955年下半年以来，社会主义事业取得了决定性的胜利，反革命的社会基础大大削弱了，我国的人民民主专政已经更加巩固了；并且由于世界和平力量的强大，美帝国主义备战政策受到各国人民日益强烈的反对，国际紧张局势日趋缓和，美国好战集团日益孤立，使得很多反革命分子过去所寄托的反革命复辟的幻想完全破灭了。同时，我们国家建设事业的欣欣向荣和社会主义的美好远景，不能不对反革命分子发生重大的影响，他们不能不重新考虑自己的前途。1955年的镇压反革命斗争给予反革命分子的打击是十分沉重的，在镇压反革命斗争的威力面前，在全国人民的政治觉悟和组织程度不断提高的情况下，反革命分子受到了越来越大的威胁。而我们对待反革命分子的镇压与宽大相结合的政策和全国农业发展纲要第五条的规定，又给反革命分子指出了一条光明的出路，因此，大批的反革命分子投案自首了。江西省萍乡县一个参加了“江西省第二区党政委员会”特务组织的反革命分子凌云，在他投案自首的时候说：“看到朝鲜与越南停战就知道没希望了，听到要继续镇压反革命就不安了，看到董必武院长在政协会议上的报告就动摇了，看到农业发展纲要感到确实有了出路了，所以决心投案”。沈阳市有一个反革命分子李广全，由东北潜逃到内蒙，他内弟的儿媳妇检举了他，又逃回家中仓房里隐藏起来。全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布后，他的孙子又要检举他，吓得他又跑到他的朋友家，他的朋友又把报纸上公布的处理投案自首分子的消息念给他听。最后，他感到没有办法才投案自首了。十分明显，如果没有镇压反革命斗争给予敌人的沉重的打击，如果不是反革命分子在人民的天罗地网面前感到走头无路，反革命分子是不会自动缴械，向人民投降的。
    事实证明，在1955年，根据对当时情况的估计，及时地采取了坚决镇压反革命的措施，开展了全国规模的镇压反革命斗争，乃是十分必要，十分正确的。如果我们容忍了反革命分子的破坏活动，我们的社会主义事业就必然要遭受到严重的危害。
    镇压反革命斗争的发展是健康的，这是因为这个斗争是按照毛主席所指示的“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的方针进行的，并且正确地执行了对待反革命分子的各项政策，广泛地发动了群众，使专门机关的工作得到了群众斗争的配合和支持。同时，1955年的镇压反革命斗争又是在我们国家的法制日趋完备的情况下进行的，对于案犯的逮捕、起诉和审判都遵守了法律规定的程序，发挥了公安、检察、法院等部门的作用，从而在很大的程度上防止了错捕、错判的现象，保护了人民的民主权利。但是，在镇压反革命斗争中也发生了一些缺点和错误，而且在个别的地方在一定的时间内还是表现得比较严重的。在1955年上半年镇压反革命斗争展开以前，曾经比较普遍地存在着对反革命分子惩治不严，即重罪轻判的右倾麻痹现象。当斗争全面展开之后，在群众对反革命的高昂的愤激情绪下，在某些地方，由于领导上掌握得不紧，和政策界限交代得不清，曾发生了一些工作中的粗糙现象，捕了一些可捕可不捕的人，或者惩办了一些虽犯有罪行但可以予以宽大处理的人，甚至有个别的错捕、错判的情形。这虽然只占处理案件中的极少数，并且已经改正了和继续防止纠正着，但由于发生错案而造成的不良结果是严重的，是值得我们深刻警惕的。各级检察机关和有关部门都抓紧了对于案件的复查工作，在一经发现错捕、错判的案件之后，都本着有错必改的精神，严肃认真地实事求是地作了纠正，并总结经验，教育了干部。今后必须提高干部的政策法律水平，改进干部的思想作风，并在工作中认真遵守法律程序，切实防止错案现象的发生。
    在镇压反革命斗争中，各级人民检察院积极进行了审查批准逮捕人犯的工作和刑事案件的起诉工作，及时地逮捕了罪应逮捕的反革命分子及其他犯罪分子，依法提起公诉，交付审判；并通过侦查监督和审判监督工作，防止和纠正了一些错捕、错判的案件，保护了人民的民主权利。经过一年来的建设，各级人民检察院的组织与业务基础比过去加强了，目前已基本上普遍建立了各级检察机构；在业务方面，也已经为健全刑事案件的侦查、起诉工作打下了基础，并创造了进一步开展其他各项检察业务的条件。但是，由于1955年各级人民检察院的组织机构尚处在建立和健全的过程中，加上我们在检察工作的建设中还存在着右倾保守思想，因而检察机关的组织与业务的发展，还赶不上工作的需要。同时，由于我们政治思想领导不够，有些检察干部在同违法犯罪现象作斗争中还缺乏应有的原则性和坚定性，未能认真地行使检察职权，充分地发挥检察工作的作用。因此，必须迅速地健全检察组织和检察制度，并切实克服工作中的缺点错误，把工作做得更好。
    我们应当足够地估计到目前残余反革命势力已经受到很大的削弱，并且发生了分化瓦解的情况，但是，我们也决不能由此认为现在已经没有反革命分子和反革命的破坏活动了，我们可以高枕无忧了。经过镇压反革命的斗争，残余反革命分子的数量虽然更加减少了，他们进行反革命活动更加困难了，但是他们并没有被彻底肃清。美帝国主义和盘踞在台湾的蒋介石集团，还会利用一切空隙派遣特务间谍对我们进行破坏。我国还处在过渡时期中，仍然存在着阶级和阶级斗争。因此，在我们面前仍然有着严重的斗争任务，我们决不能放松自己的警惕和斗争。更加深入开展同反革命分子和其他犯罪分子的斗争
    当前我们在镇压反革命斗争战线上的任务，是利用目前有利的形势和条件更加深入地开展同反革命分子和其他犯罪分子的斗争，彻底肃清一切反革命分子。今后镇压反革命斗争的锋芒，主要是打击那些进行现行破坏活动的反革命分子，打击帝国主义和蒋介石集团派遣潜伏的特务间谍分子。对于历史上的反革命分子，应该是着重打击那些罪恶严重、民愤很大又拒不坦白的分子。对于历史上仅有一般的反革命罪行，已经作了坦白交代，解放后又未进行破坏活动的分子，可以从宽处理，免于追究。我们对待反革命分子的政策，从来都是镇压与宽大相结合的政策，即“坦白从宽、抗拒从严、立功折罪、立大功受奖”的政策，给予反革命分子悔过自新、重新做人的机会。凡真诚坦白，经过查实的，均分别予以宽大处理，罪轻的可以免刑，罪该判处重刑的可以减刑，即使罪该判处死刑的也可以免处死刑。对于不但自己真诚坦白，并有立功表现的反革命分子，则将功折罪，免予刑事处分；立有大功的，并可给予奖励。这种宽大政策不仅适用于犯有一般罪行的反革命分子，也适用于犯有重大罪行的反革命分子；不仅适用于有历史罪行的反革命分子，而且也适用于派遣潜伏的特务间谍分子。一切反革命分子只要真诚坦白自首，都可以受到应得的宽大处理。同时，我们对于那些真诚悔过自新，愿意在劳动中改造自己的人，都将给以劳动生产的机会。在全国农业发展纲要
  （草案）中，对反革命分子参加农业生产的问题已经做了规定，并且各地农业合作化运动中已在这样做，有些反革命分子已经参加了农业合作社，走上了新的生活道路。我们要把一切可以改造的反革命分子改造成为自食其力的公民，使他们能够参加社会主义建设和随着全国人民进入社会主义社会。这是我们对待反革命分子的一项根本政策，是符合于我们改造社会、建立人人幸福的社会主义社会的根本目的的。但是，必然还会有一些至死不悟的反革命分子是要坚决顽抗与人民为敌到底的，他们必然要继续对我们的社会主义事业进行破坏，对于这些反革命分子必须坚决地予以逮捕和依法严厉的惩办。进一步健全人民民主法制
    随着社会主义事业的发展和镇压反革命斗争的胜利，目前迫切地需要进一步健全人民民主的法制。现在，那种公开的暴露的残余反革命分子已经基本上被肃清了，今后暗藏的反革命分子破坏活动的方式将会更加隐蔽与诡秘，他们将会以两面派的手法和“合法”的形式同我们进行斗争。因此，为了有效地准确地打击一切反革命分子和其他犯罪分子，并保护人民的民主权利，就更加必须实行完备的法律制度，按照法律规定的程序进行对刑事案件的侦查、审判工作。而当前加强人民民主法制的一个重要方面，就是加强检察机关，健全检察制度，因为检察工作现在还是国家法制工作中比较薄弱的一个环节。必须在检察机构已经基本上普遍建立的基础上，继续加强检察机关的组织建设，补充培养和训练检察干部，健全各级检察机构。并迅速地健全检察业务，使各级人民检察院切实地担负起刑事案件的侦查、起诉任务，以便有效地追究一切犯罪分子，并对侦查活动和审判活动是否合法实行更切实的监督，充分发挥公安、检察、法院三个部门之间互相配合、互相制约的作用，从法律制度上防止和克服侦查、审判工作中的缺点与错误。同时，要加强对国家机关工作人员是否遵守法律的监督工作，坚决地向任何滥用职权、营私舞弊等违反法律的行为进行斗争，保障法律的正确实施，巩固国家工作中的法制。必须使我们国家的法制有足够强大的威力，使一切阴险狡猾的犯罪分子都无法逃避法律的惩罚；同时，要运用国家的法制去保护人民群众的权利，不使一个无辜的人遭受非法的逮捕和审判。国家法制在人民群众中的威信愈高，人民的权利愈是能够受到国家法律的保护，人民群众建设社会主义的积极性和关心国家事务的主动精神，就会更高地发扬起来，人民民主制度的基础就会更加巩固。关于处理拘押在我国的日本战争犯罪分子问题
    最后，我想讲一下关于处理拘押在我国的日本战争犯罪分子的问题，这是全国人民都非常关心的一件事情。关于日本侵略中国战争中战争犯罪分子的大部分包括一些首要的战争犯罪分子，于日本投降后，曾经远东国际军事法庭和当时的中国政府作了处理。现在关押在我国的日本战争犯罪分子在日本战犯中是比较次要的一部分。其中一部分是被我国逮捕的，共有一百四十人，他们中间有些是日本投降后又参加蒋介石、阎锡山反革命内战，于1948年、1949年被人民解放军逮捕的。另有一部分是1945年为苏联军队俘获的在我国犯有罪行的战争犯罪分子，于1950年7月经苏联政府移交我国，这一部分共有969名。上述战争犯罪分子在这几年中死亡了四十七名，目前在押的日本战争犯罪分子共有1，062名。最高人民检察院对于这些在押的战争犯罪分子进行了长期的侦讯工作，从各个方面调查收集了充分的证据，并且对各个罪犯进行了讯问。由于这些战争犯罪分子的犯罪地点遍及全国曾经沦陷过的地区，战后又经过了很长的时间，要查清他们的罪行需要进行许多的工作和相当的时间，因此，侦讯工作直到最近才全部完成。经过侦查证实，这些战争犯罪分子在日本帝国主义侵略我国的战争期间，违背国际法准则和人道原则，曾对我国人民犯有各种罪行。但除其中一小部分犯有严重的罪行外，其余多数是在日本侵略战争过程中犯有一般罪行的次要的战争犯罪分子，也有一些是被日本帝国主义驱使参加侵略战争，在其上级长官的命令指示下犯了罪行的。同时，由于他们在关押期间受到了反对战争维护和平的教育和人道主义待遇的感化，由于他们看到战后世界和平力量的日益加强和日本人民在美军占领下所遭受的苦难，他们中间的大多数已有不同程度的悔罪表现。根据这些情况，并且鉴于日本投降后十年来情况的变化和现在的处境，鉴于近年来中日两国人民友好关系的发展，在全国人民代表大会常务委员会“关于处理在押日本侵略中国战争中战争犯罪分子的决定”中，决定对于这些战争犯罪分子按照宽大政策分别予以适当的处理。最高人民检察院依照全国人民代表大会常务委员会的决定，对于罪行严重的日本战争犯罪分子，已经向最高人民法院特别军事法庭提起公诉，进行审判。对于大多数次要的或者悔罪表现较好的日本战争犯罪分子，则从宽予以处理，免予起诉。并将由中国红十字会协助他们回日本。
    我国人民遭受日本军国主义侵略的时间最长，所受痛苦最深。从1931年“九一八”事变至1945年日本帝国主义投降这十四年中间，中国人民在日本军国主义的血腥侵略下，历尽了深重的苦难，遭受了巨大的生命财产的损失。惩办日本战争犯罪分子是中国人民的正义要求和庄严权利。现在，我们国家根据当前国际国内的局势，根据在押日本战争犯罪分子的罪行情节和关押期间的表现，对这些日本战争犯罪分子作出了严正而宽大的处理，既依法制裁了罪行严重的极少数犯罪分子，又宽赦了其中可以宽赦的大多数。这样处理完全符合于我国人民的长远利益，并且有利于中日两国人民友好关系的发展，有利于巩固远东和世界持久和平。这充分表现着我国人民宽大为怀的精神，也可以表现出我国人民的力量和世界和平的力量的强大，表现着对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平的高度信心。因此，我们相信，我们的这一措施必然会得到我国人民的热烈拥护，也将会得到日本人民的同情和世界爱好和平人民的支持。
