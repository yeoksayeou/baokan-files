            Must Bring Out the Real Goods
            Chaotic Reaction
    The Soviet Union's reduction of 1.2 million troops caused a chaotic reaction in Washington. Many senior officials have been constantly making contradictory statements.
    At a press conference, Dulles said with great seriousness: "The Soviet reduction is mainly in personnel, not in armaments." And "real disarmament...should stipulate the reduction of weapons." Then, he threatened Western countries that welcomed the Soviet disarmament, saying that the demobilized soldiers "in factories manufacturing military power may be more threatening than when they are permanently stationed in the army."
    A few days later, Eisenhower's disarmament advisor, Stassen, pointed out that the significance of the Soviet disarmament should not be underestimated. Then he admitted that the Soviet government's statement contained provisions on reducing armaments, equipment, military spending, and personnel. He said that this statement amounted to a reduction in the Soviet Union's conventional military potential.
    The American military is equally incoherent. The Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, insisted to a Senate subcommittee that the Soviet disarmament was a "trap." But U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson, while deliberately questioning the significance of the Soviet disarmament, also admitted that the Soviet action "is a step in the right direction." The U.S. Department of Defense, while warning people not to believe that the Soviet Union's planned reduction of 1.2 million troops would reduce the so-called "threat," also admitted: "If the Soviet Union implements its planned disarmament, Russia's armed personnel may be fewer than the United States."
        "Logical" Contradiction
    These contradictory statements confused some American reporters, who asked Eisenhower to explain them at the American president's press conference on May 23. Eisenhower only said one sentence: these differences of opinion, in his view, "are all logical."
    Indeed, for Dulles and Radford, who are一心yào gǎo expansion of armaments and war preparations and maintain tension, it would be illogical if they did not try their best to belittle the significance of Soviet disarmament.
    And for people like Stassen, facing the demands of various countries for disarmament and the American people's desire for peace and prosperity expressed in the election year, it is obviously logical to say something to cater to public opinion.
        The War Atmosphere Must Not Be Eased
    The British "Times" once reminded readers: "The Russian initiative...comes at a time when (the US) Congress is discussing increasing the military budget by billions of dollars," and may well affect the US expansion plan. The American "York Daily" further pointed out: The US "militarization of the economy has reached such a degree that weapons production has become an inseparable part of our entire economic system, so that even a slight easing of the war atmosphere than it is now, will shake the entire economic system." The fact is that the Soviet Union's disarmament declaration immediately caused a sharp drop in stock market prices in the United States.
    In order to comfort the jittery arms dealers, Dulles and Radford not only tried their best to belittle the significance of the Soviet disarmament, but also assured them that the United States would not only not disarm, but also expand its armaments. For example, the day after the Soviet Union announced its disarmament, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Burgess told the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that the United States plans to maintain an armed force of about 2.85 million people for the "indefinite future." The current total number of U.S. armed forces is 2,814,000 people.
          Cannot Produce Real Goods
    However, in this day and age, it is increasingly impossible to only appease arms merchants and ignore the calls of the broad masses of the people. Dulles and his ilk cannot erase the widespread impact caused by the Soviet Union's disarmament action. As the famous American commentator Lippmann pointed out: "The more Mr. Dulles proves that the Soviets have lost nothing by reducing their military manpower, the more deeply rooted their example becomes." The Soviet Union's actions "indicate to Western Europe the path to security and prosperity."
    Therefore, openly opposing the Soviet Union's disarmament action is obviously unwise. Now, as U.S. Senator Hubert Humphrey lamented, "Russia has once again seized the initiative." In order to extricate the United States from its passive situation, Stassen and his ilk had to "welcome" the Soviet Union's disarmament declaration on the one hand, and on the other hand, release information saying that in mid-June, the United States intends to propose a "super" disarmament proposal in order to break the "deadlock" on the disarmament issue. Stassen also optimistically predicted that next year "there is hope of reaching an agreement on the disarmament issue," appearing as if the United States is also very enthusiastic about disarmament. However, according to reports: "Eisenhower's 'Open Skies' plan is still the core of this new 'super' plan." This shows that even if there is such a plan, it is just another trick to deceive public opinion.
    However, when the Soviet Union is seriously reducing 1.2 million troops, all fake goods on the disarmament issue have no market. If the United States does not want to be condemned as the culprit for obstructing disarmament, it must come up with genuine goods. However, in Stassen's briefcase, such genuine goods have never existed so far.

    必须拿出真货来
            混乱的反应
    苏联裁军一百二十万人在华盛顿引起了混乱的反应。许多高级官员不断发表彼此矛盾的谈话。
    杜勒斯在一次记者招待会上曾经煞有介事地说：“苏联的裁减主要是在人员方面而不是在军备方面”。而“真正的裁军……应该规定裁减武器”。然后，他又恫吓那些欢迎苏联裁军的西方国家说，苏联裁军使复员军人“在工厂里制造的军事力量也许比他们常驻在军队里的情况下更加有威胁性”。
    隔了没几天，艾森豪威尔的裁军顾问史塔生却指出不应该低估苏联裁军的意义。接着他承认，苏联政府的这个声明包含有关于裁减军火、装备和军事开支以及人员的规定。他说这个声明等于裁减苏联常规的军事潜力。
    美国的军界人士也一样的语无伦次。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在参议院小组委员会上硬说苏联的裁军是一种“圈套”。可是美国国防部长威尔逊尽管故意怀疑苏联裁军的意义，却也承认苏联的行动“是朝着正确方向走的一个步骤。”美国国防部一面警告人们不要相信苏联计划中的一百二十万人的裁军会减少所谓“威胁”，同时又承认：“如果苏联实行了计划中的裁军，俄国的武装人员就可能比美国少了”。
        “合乎逻辑”的矛盾
    这种种矛盾的说法把一些美国记者也闹糊涂了，他们在五月二十三日美国总统举行的记者招待会上要求艾森豪威尔解释一番。艾森豪威尔只说了一句：这些分歧的意见，在他看来“都是合乎逻辑的”。
    的确，对于一心要搞扩军备战、维持紧张局势的杜勒斯和雷德福之流来说，如果他们不竭力贬低苏联裁军的意义，那才是不合逻辑的事情呢。
    而对于史塔生这些人来说，面对着各国对于裁军的要求和美国人民在大选年中所表示的对和平和繁荣的愿望，说些迎合舆论的话，显然也是合乎逻辑的。
        战争气氛缓和不得
    英国“泰晤士报”曾经提醒读者：“俄国的倡议……正好是在（美国）国会讨论要增加数十亿美元的军费预算的时候提出来的，”同时很可能会影响美国的扩军计划。美国的“约克日报”更进一步指出：美国的“经济的军事化已经到了这样程度，使得武器的生产成了我们整个经济系统中不可分离的一部分，以至于战争气氛比目前稍微有一些缓和的迹象，就会使整个经济系统发生震动”。事实正是这样，苏联裁军声明在美国立刻引起了股票行市的急剧下跌。
    为了安慰惊疑不定的军火老板，杜勒斯和雷德福之流不但竭力贬低苏联裁军的意义，而且向他们作出保证：美国不但不裁军，而且还要扩军。例如在苏联宣布裁军的第二天，美国助理国防部长伯吉斯在美国参议院拨款小组委员会上就说：美国计划在“无限期的未来”保持约二百八十五万人的武装部队。而目前美国武装部队的总数是二百八十一万四千人。
          拿不出真货色
    但是，在现在这个年头，要想只安慰军火商人而不理会广大人民的呼声，是越来越行不通了。杜勒斯之流并不能抹煞苏联的裁军行动所引起的广泛的影响。正如美国著名评论家李普曼所指出的：“杜勒斯先生越是证明苏联人裁减军事人力毫无所失，他们所树立的榜样就越发深入人心。”苏联的行动向西欧“指示出通向安全和繁荣的道路。”
    因此，公开反对苏联的裁军行动显然是不聪明的。现在，正如美国参议员休伯特·汉弗莱所慨叹的，“俄国再一次夺到了主动”。为了使美国从被动的情况下摆脱出来，史塔生之流只好一方面表示“欢迎”苏联的裁军声明，另一方面又放出空气说，在六月中旬美国打算提出一个“超级”裁军建议，以便打破裁军问题上的“僵局”。史塔生并且乐观地预料明年“有希望就裁军问题达成协议”，显得美国似乎也是非常热心于裁军的。但是，据报道：“艾森豪威尔的‘开放天空’的计划仍然是这个新的‘超级’计划的核心。”这就说明纵使有这样一个计划，也不过是又一个迷惑舆论的把戏。
    但是，在苏联正在认真地裁减一百二十万军队的时候，裁军问题上的一切假货色都是没有市场的。美国如果不想被谴责为阻挠裁军的罪魁祸首，就必须拿出货真价实的东西来。可是，在史塔生的皮包里，这种真货色到现在为止还不曾有过。
