    Strengthening Cotton Field Management
    Wu Xifu
    This year, all cotton-growing areas have actively promoted advanced cotton planting experience on the basis of collectivization, and cotton planting techniques have been greatly improved. In many areas, the cotton sowing period was generally brought forward by ten to fifteen days compared with previous years, and the sowing time was shortened. This year, the emergence of cotton seedlings and the development of cotton seedlings in most areas are normal. However, in some areas, due to the failure to grasp the appropriate sowing depth and suppression techniques according to specific conditions during sowing, the failure to remove the surface crust in time after sowing, or the poor quality of the cotton seeds used, the emergence of cotton seedlings was not good, resulting in a relatively serious shortage of seedlings. At present, the climate in many cotton-growing areas is abnormal, with temperature rising and falling suddenly, and heavy rainfall, which affects the emergence and normal development of cotton seedlings. At the same time, seedling-stage pests and diseases are spreading. Therefore, strengthening cotton field management and doing a good job in seedling protection is an important task in cotton production at present.
    In order to protect seedlings, it is first necessary to do a solid job of checking and replanting seedlings. Whether the cotton fields have been thinned or not, a detailed inspection is required. For some cotton fields where cotton seedlings are growing weakly or pests and diseases have begun to spread, measures such as early mid-tillage and early fertilization should be taken to increase soil temperature, improve nutritional conditions, promote seedling growth, and increase resistance to adverse external conditions. Areas with missing seedlings should quickly transplant seedlings to fill the gaps, and ensure that the cotton seedlings in each cotton field grow healthily and truly achieve full emergence.
    Thinning is the decisive key to close planting. When thinning, it is necessary to strictly follow the planned seedling density, and retain strong seedlings while removing diseased and weak seedlings. If cotton seedlings are growing healthily and have few pests and diseases, thinning can be carried out when they have two true leaves; if emergence is uneven or there are more pests and diseases, the thinning period can be delayed until the seedlings have three or four true leaves. Especially for cotton fields with high salt-alkali content, thinning should not be carried out too early. Although close planting is an important measure to increase production, it is necessary to overcome the incorrect idea that the denser the planting, the higher the yield, and the density should not be specified in a generalized manner regardless of conditions. Appropriate close planting standards must be determined separately according to variety characteristics, soil fertility, soil quality, terrain, dry land or irrigated land, and groundwater level. In order to ensure the required density, a ruler must be used to thin the seedlings.
    Mid-tillage of cotton fields must be timely, and the quality must be improved at the same time. At present, cotton fields are still in a state of crusting due to excessive rainfall, so it is necessary to seize the time to harrow and loosen the soil, and pay special attention to eliminating the hard shell on the cotton rows or near the cotton seedlings.
    Timely topdressing is an important measure in seedling stage management. The type and amount of topdressing should be determined according to the application of base fertilizer. In most cotton-growing areas, there is more rain in the later period, which easily leads to serious shedding of buds and bolls. Therefore, all seedling stage management measures should be able to promote early seedling development and early flowering and boll setting, in order to reduce the shedding of buds and bolls during the later rainy season. If nitrogen fertilizer is used as topdressing, it must be applied early. With the general increase in fertilizer application in cotton fields this year, attention should be paid to the combined application of phosphate fertilizer. Topdressing is best applied by ditching, and applied to a depth of less than ten centimeters near the cotton roots.
    This year, the irrigation area of cotton fields has been greatly expanded, and attention must be paid to irrigation techniques in order to fully exploit the yield-increasing effect of irrigation. Cotton field irrigation should adopt the method of small and frequent irrigation. In some canal irrigation areas, excessive irrigation is often detrimental to cotton production. Especially after heavy irrigation, encountering rainwater will lead to reduced production. These areas should promote the method of small ridges or furrow irrigation to reduce the amount of irrigation water. Whether in the southern or northern cotton-growing areas, serious late-maturing yield reduction is often caused by excessive rainfall in the later period, so all localities should carry out drainage work such as soil cultivation and ditching. This year, most cotton-growing areas have realized collectivization in rural areas, and land has been concentrated, which is a favorable condition for opening drainage ditches. All localities should make preparations for this work as early as possible.
    This year, the number of pesticides and equipment for pest control has greatly increased compared with last year, which is a favorable condition for pest control. All cotton-growing areas must closely monitor the pest situation and, in accordance with the spirit of early control, eliminate pests in the spot stage. When the parasitism rate of cotton aphids on cotton plants reaches 20%-30%, comprehensive control should be carried out. Early treatment when pests are still small can save labor and fully exploit the effectiveness of pesticides and equipment.
    Cotton seedling stage management is very heavy. In addition to making preparations in terms of means of production, labor, and animal power, it is also necessary to strengthen the teaching of seedling stage management techniques, and pay attention to overcoming the resistance of the masses and cadres to techniques such as early thinning, rational close planting, ruler thinning, deep mid-tillage, and the implementation of furrow irrigation. At the same time, when learning and applying advanced technologies from other places, all localities must closely integrate with local specific conditions and the original experience of the masses, appropriately grasp the implementation, and prevent the bias of mechanical application.

    加强棉田管理
    吴锡福
    今年各棉区都在合作化的基础上积极推广了植棉先进经验，植棉技术有了很大的改进。许多地区棉花播种期，一般比往年提早了十至十五天，而且缩短了播种时间。今年大部地区棉花出苗和棉苗发育的情况是正常的。但也有一些地区，因为播种的时候没有根据具体条件掌握适当的播种深度和镇压技术，播种后没有及时破除田面板结，或所用棉种质量差，棉花出苗不好，形成比较严重的缺苗现象。目前许多棉区气候不正常，温度忽升忽降，雨水多，影响棉苗出土和正常发育，同时苗期病虫害有蔓延的趋势。因此，加强棉田管理，做好保苗工作，是当前棉花生产中的重要任务。
    为了保苗，首先要切实做好查苗补苗工作。无论已经定了苗或还没定苗的棉田，都需要进行详细的检查，对于一些棉苗生长弱或病虫开始蔓延的棉田，要进行早中耕、早施肥等措施，以提高地温，改善营养条件，促进幼苗的生育，增加抵抗外界不利条件的能力。缺苗的地区要赶快进行移苗补缺，务必使每块棉田的棉苗生长健壮，确实达到全苗。
    定苗是密植的决定关键，定苗的时候必须严格按照计划的留苗密度进行，并留下健壮的苗，拔除病弱的苗。棉苗生长健壮、病虫害少的，可以在两片真叶时定苗；出苗不整齐或病虫害较多的，定苗时期可以延迟至三、四片真叶时再进行，尤其对于含盐碱较重的棉田，不应太早定苗。密植虽然是增产的重要措施，但是必须克服越密越增产的不正确思想，也不能不问条件一般化地规定密度。必须根据品种特性、地力、土质、地势、旱地或灌溉地、地下水位等情况，分别确定适当的密植标准。为了保证应有的密度，一定要用尺来定苗。
    棉田的中耕必须及时，同时要提高质量。目前棉田因为多雨还有板结状态，必须抓紧耙地松土，特别要注意消除棉行上或棉苗附近的硬壳。
    及时追肥是苗期管理工作中的一个重要措施，要根据基肥的施用情况酌定追肥的种类及数量。大部分棉区后期雨多，容易引起蕾铃的严重脱落，因此，一切的苗期管理措施都要能促进幼苗发育提早开花结铃，以减少后期雨季蕾铃脱落。如果采用氮素肥料作追肥，必需早施。在今年棉田一般增加了肥料的情况下，要注意磷肥的配合施用。追肥最好能采用沟施方法，并且施到土层十公分以下近棉根的部位。
    今年棉田灌溉面积扩大了很多，必须讲究灌溉技术，以充分发挥灌溉的增产作用。棉田灌溉应该采取小水勤浇的方法。一些渠浇地往往因为浇水太多反而对棉花增产不利，尤其浇大水后，遇到雨水更会招致减产。这类地区应该推行小畦或开沟的灌水方法，以减少灌水量。无论南方棉区或北方棉区，常因后期多雨造成严重的晚熟减产，所以各地都应该进行培土、开沟等排水工作。今年大部分棉区的农村实现了合作化，土地集中了，这对于开排水沟是一个有利条件。各地应该及早地做好这项工作的准备。
    今年防治虫害的药械比去年大大增加，这是防治虫害的有利条件。各地棉区必须严密掌握虫情，根据早治的精神，消灭虫害在点片阶段。棉蚜在棉株上的寄生率达到20％—30％的时候，就要进行全面防治。在害虫还小的时候就及时早治，既可节省劳力，又能充分发挥药械的效能。
    棉花苗期管理工作是很繁重的，必须按照各项技术措施的要求，除了要在生产资料、劳动力、畜力条件等方面作好准备外，还必须加强苗期管理技术的传授，注意克服群众和干部中对早间苗、合理密植、用尺定苗、深中耕、实行开沟灌溉等技术的抵触情绪。同时，各地在学习应用外地的先进技术的时候，必须密切结合当地具体条件和群众原有的经验，适当地掌握实施，防止机械搬用的偏向。
