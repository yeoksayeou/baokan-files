Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: TASS reported: Yugoslav President Tito said in Moscow last night that I can say that it is not difficult for us to find a common language with the leaders of this great country. There is no problem that we cannot find a common language on, especially when it comes to the independence of our country and the independence of our foreign policy.

Tito also said that we treat the attitude of the Soviet leaders towards Yugoslavia with full understanding.

On the evening of the 6th, Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, once again held a reception for Tito. Tito delivered a short speech while toasting Voroshilov.

Tito said, we hope and believe that the day will surely come when international problems will be solved not by force, not by the use of force, but only by peaceful negotiations. We also hope that the leaders of other countries will make more use of direct contact and such mutual visits.

At the reception, Voroshilov first gave a welcome speech to the Yugoslav guests. He said that the Soviet-Yugoslav talks that have begun are being conducted in a friendly and sincere atmosphere, in a spirit of frankness and full understanding. The talks involve issues of further developing Soviet-Yugoslav relations and important international issues of concern to both countries.

Voroshilov also said that the Soviet government and our Communist Party highly appreciate the fundamental reforms of historical significance achieved by the working people of Yugoslavia. Under the leadership of the League of Communists, headed by Comrade Tito, a veteran fighter who has been tested in the cause of the working people, the people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia are advancing confidently along the road of socialist construction and have made significant achievements on this road.

The Soviet Union has always adhered to a foreign policy of peace, and it is pleased to see that fraternal Yugoslavia stands with it in resolving many important international issues. Yugoslavia has made a significant contribution to easing international tensions and consolidating peace.

Voroshilov said that we believe that great possibilities for joint action on the international stage have been opened up before our two countries. It can be boldly said that there is currently a broad common ground between the Soviet government and the Yugoslav government for active cooperation. He also said that our two countries are deeply concerned about how to achieve close cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields, and are concerned about exchanging advanced experience in building a new life. This cooperation has already yielded results.

The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government attended this sincere and friendly reception. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea headed by Kim Il-sung, which is currently in Moscow, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union were also invited to attend the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, on the evening of June 6th, Yugoslav President Tito answered some questions raised by foreign reporters at the reception held by Voroshilov.

CBS reporter Saul asked President Tito whether the relationship between the two parties was an issue discussed by Yugoslav and Soviet politicians in the talks. Tito replied that so far only issues related to relations between the two countries have been discussed. But he also said that he sees no reason why there should not be a relationship between the two parties, just as there is a relationship between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and socialist parties and all progressive movements in various countries.

An NBC reporter asked whether his visit to the Soviet Union would help change relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. Tito replied that the visit would be beneficial to the Soviet Union, the United States, and the entire world.

Saul also asked if he knew that McCarthy had asked the Senate to stop lending to Yugoslavia. President Tito replied that this was not important because Yugoslavia's relations with the United States would not be harmed by this, and its friendship with the United States would remain unchanged.

Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: TASS Leningrad News: Yugoslav President Tito and his entourage, accompanied by Bulganin, Shepilov, and others, arrived in Leningrad by car on June 7th.

    伏罗希洛夫为铁托再次举行招待会   
    宾主致词表示充分的相互谅解和友好的精神
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社报道：南斯拉夫总统铁托昨晚在莫斯科说，我可以说，我们同这个伟大国家的领导人之间，不难找到共同的语言。没有什么问题，会在我们之间找不到共同语言，特别是在有关我国独立和我们外交政策独立的时候。
    铁托又说，我们以充分的谅解来对待苏联领导人对南斯拉夫的态度。
    六日晚间，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫再一次为铁托举行了招待会。铁托在回敬伏罗希洛夫的干杯时发表了简短的讲话。
    铁托说，我们希望并且相信，国际问题不用强力，不使用武力，而只用和平谈判方法来解决，这样的一天一定会到来。我们还希望，其他国家的领导人也将更多地采用直接接触和这种相互访问的方法。
    在这次招待会上，伏罗希洛夫首先发表了欢迎南斯拉夫客人的讲话。他说，已经开始的苏南会谈，是在友好、真诚的气氛中，本着坦率和充分谅解的精神进行的，会谈涉及到进一步发展苏南关系的问题，以及两国所关心的重要国际问题。
    伏罗希洛夫又说，苏联政府和我们的共产党，对于南斯拉夫劳动人民所实现的具有历史意义的根本改革给予很高的评价。在以为劳动人民的事业而斗争的久经考验的战士铁托同志为首的共产主义者联盟的领导下，南斯拉夫的各族人民正在满怀信心地沿着社会主义建设的道路前进，并且在这条道路上取得了重大的成就。
    苏联一贯坚持执行爱好和平的外交政策，它满意地看到，在解决许多重要的国际问题上，兄弟般的南斯拉夫是同它站在一起的，南斯拉夫对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的事业有重大的贡献。
    伏罗希洛夫说，我们相信，我们两国面前已经打开了在国际舞台上共同行动的极大可能性。可以大胆地说，目前苏联政府和南斯拉夫政府之间，有着广泛的共同基础来进行积极的合作。他还说，我们两国都深切关心如何在政治、经济和文化方面取得紧密的合作，关心交换建设新生活的先进经验。这种合作也已经带来了成果。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人都出席了这次诚挚友好的招待会。现在莫斯科的以金日成为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团和各国驻苏联外交使节也应邀出席了招待会。
    新华社7日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，六月六日晚间，南斯拉夫总统铁托在伏罗希洛夫举行的招待会上回答了外国记者提出的一些问题。
    哥伦比亚广播公司记者索尔问铁托总统，两个党的关系问题是不是南斯拉夫和苏联政治家在会谈中讨论的问题。铁托回答说，迄今为止只讨论了有关两国之间的关系问题。但是他又说，他看不出有什么理由两个党之间不应该存在关系，正如南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟同各国社会党和所有进步运动之间存在着关系一样。
    美国全国广播公司记者问，他访问苏联是否将有助于改变苏联和美国之间的关系，铁托回答说，这次访问对苏联、对美国和对全世界都是有益的。
    索尔又问，他是否知道麦卡锡曾经要求参议院停止给南斯拉夫贷款，铁托总统回答说，这是不重要的，因为南斯拉夫同美国的关系并不会因此受到损害，它同美国的友谊将保持不变。
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒讯：南斯拉夫总统铁托和他的随行人员，在布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫等的陪同下，六月七日乘车到达列宁格勒。
