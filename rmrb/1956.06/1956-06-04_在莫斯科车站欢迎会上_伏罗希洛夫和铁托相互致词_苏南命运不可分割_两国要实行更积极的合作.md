Xinhua News Agency, 3rd June. TASS reports: While welcoming Yugoslav President Tito, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, said that Tito's visit to the Soviet Union "is a new and significant contribution to the cause of strengthening the sincere friendship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and to further developing the political, economic, and cultural ties between our two peoples." He believes that "this visit will promote more active cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in resolving pressing international issues for the sake of peace and human happiness."

Voroshilov made these remarks on June 2nd at the Kiev Railway Station in Moscow while welcoming Tito and his entourage. After delivering his welcoming speech, Tito delivered a reply.

Speaking through a loudspeaker, Voroshilov said that the famous declaration signed in Belgrade a year ago based on the results of the talks between the Soviet and Yugoslav government delegations is being successfully implemented, as evidenced by the agreements already signed between the two countries on economic and trade issues, as well as scientific and technological and cultural cooperation. All of this positively demonstrates that the restored friendly relations are bringing good results that deeply satisfy the peoples of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

At the same time, life urgently demands further development and consolidation of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, which is beneficial to our socialist countries. We all understand very well that this friendship will continue to be an extremely important factor in the peaceful cooperation of all countries and their struggle to consolidate world peace.

In his reply, Tito said, "We have come to Moscow with sincere respect and the best wishes of all the nationalities of our country for the nationalities of the Soviet Union. I think it is not necessary to prove to you that the nationalities of Yugoslavia have always ardently hoped that your efforts in building socialism will produce the best positive results. They are happy for every achievement you make and saddened by every difficulty and obstacle you encounter on your great path."

Tito said that the nationalities of our country have always expressed sympathy for the pain and sacrifices you suffered during the Great October Revolution, after the revolution, and especially during the Second World War, in the struggle against the fascist aggressors—our common enemy. We deeply sympathize with your efforts and the unavoidable difficulties you faced after the Second World War, especially in rebuilding the villages and cities destroyed by the fascist aggressors.

Tito emphasized that the people of our country highly value all of this and understand it very well. Historically, we have repeatedly shared life and death and shared weal and woe in the struggle against common enemies who attempted to enslave our people and destroy our peaceful lives. The common struggle of our two peoples against the common enemy from 1941 to the end of the war proved an irrefutable truth: our destinies are inseparable, and we should value and respect each other.

However, some unexpected tragic events still occurred. We felt very saddened at the time. However, we believe that all the factors that divided us will one day be eliminated, and our friendship will one day gain a new and solid foundation. Tito said, "Thanks to the Leninist policies of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the CPSU, that day has finally arrived. Now, all of this has become a historical relic for us."

I am deeply convinced that this development process of relations and friendship between our two countries is not only a great contribution to world peace, but also a significant contribution to the normal development of international relations and an inspiring force and milestone for further development of the entire international workers' movement and progressive movement.

The Yugoslav president finally expressed his deep conviction that his visit will not only further promote the strengthening of trust between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, but also promote the strengthening of trust within the international community. He said, "Our visit makes the prospect of peaceful coexistence between governments and peoples of all countries clearer."

Marshal Tito's reply received warm applause from the welcomers.

The Yugoslav guests, along with the leaders of the Soviet government and the Communist Party, walked out of the Kiev Railway Station and traveled by car to the residence prepared for the guests. Hundreds of thousands of Muscovites stood along the road, applauding the leaders of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, expressing their respect.

    在莫斯科车站欢迎会上
    伏罗希洛夫和铁托相互致词
    苏南命运不可分割　两国要实行更积极的合作
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫，在欢迎南斯拉夫总统铁托的时候说，铁托的访问苏联“是对加强苏南两国的诚挚友谊的事业，对更加发展我们两国人民之间的政治、经济和文化联系的事业的一个新的重大贡献”。他相信，“这次访问将促使苏南两国在为了和平和人类的幸福来解决迫切的国际问题方面实行更加积极的合作。”
    伏罗希洛夫是六月二日在莫斯科的基辅火车站上欢迎铁托和他的随行人员的时候说这番话的。在他致了欢迎词以后，铁托致了答词。
    伏罗希洛夫在扩音器前说，一年以前，根据苏南两国政府代表团会谈的结果在贝尔格莱德签署的著名宣言，正在胜利地执行中，两国之间已经签订的关于经济和贸易问题以及科学技术和文化合作的协定，就证明了这一点。这一切都肯定地说明，已经恢复起来的友好联系正在带来使苏南两国人民感到深深满意的良好结果。
    同时，生活迫切要求进一步发展和巩固苏南两国的关系，以有利于我们的社会主义国家。我们大家都很明白，这一友谊今后仍将是各国人民的和平合作和他们争取巩固世界和平的斗争的一个极其重要的因素。
    铁托在致答词中说，我们怀着衷心的敬意和我国各族人民对苏联各族人民的最好祝愿来到了莫斯科。我认为，不必向你们证明，南斯拉夫各族人民一向热烈希望你们在建设社会主义方面的努力会产生最好的积极结果。他们对你们的每一个成就都感到高兴，对你们在你们的伟大道路上遭到的每一个困难和障碍都感到难过。
    铁托说，我国各族人民一直对你们在伟大的十月革命期间，在革命以后，特别是在第二次世界大战中，在反抗法西斯侵略者——我们的共同敌人的斗争中所遭受的痛苦和牺牲表示同情。我们深深同情你们的努力和你们在第二次世界大战结束后，特别是在重建被法西斯侵略者破坏了的乡村和城市的过程中所无法避免的困难。
    铁托强调说，我国人民对这一切估价很高而且是很理解这一切的。在历史上，我们屡屡在反对企图奴役我们人民和破坏我们的和平生活的共同敌人的斗争中同生死，共患难。我们两国人民在从1941年到战争结束这段时期内反对共同敌人的共同斗争，证明了一个确定不移的真理：我们的命运是不可分割的，我们应当互相重视，互相尊敬。
    但是，依然发生了一些出人意外的悲剧性事件。当时我们感到非常沉痛。然而我们相信，一切分裂我们的因素总有一天会消除的，我们的友谊总有一天会获得新的、巩固的基础的。铁托说，“由于苏联政府和苏共中央的列宁主义政策，这一天终于来到了。现在，这一切都成了我们历史的陈迹了”。
    我深信，我们两国之间的关系和友谊的这种发展过程，不仅是对世界和平的巨大贡献，而且也是对国际关系的正常发展的重大贡献，是进一步发展整个国际工人运动和进步运动的鼓舞力量和里程碑。
    南斯拉夫总统最后表示深信，他的这次访问不仅将会更加促进苏南两国的信任的加强，而且也会促进国际范围内信任的加强。他说，“我们这次访问使得各国政府和各国人民之间和平共处的远景更加明朗化了。”
    铁托元帅的答词获得了欢迎者的热烈的掌声。
    南斯拉夫客人同苏联政府和共产党的领导人走出基辅火车站，乘汽车前往为客人们准备的寓所。沿路两旁伫立着的数十万莫斯科人，向南斯拉夫和苏联的领导人鼓掌，表示敬意。
