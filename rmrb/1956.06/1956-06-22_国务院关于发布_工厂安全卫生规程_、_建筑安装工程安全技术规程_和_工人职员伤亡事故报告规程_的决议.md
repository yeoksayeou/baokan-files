Improving working conditions and protecting the safety and health of workers in production is an important policy of our country and one of the basic principles of socialist enterprise management. In recent years, various departments of the national economy and various enterprises have done a lot of work in the field of labor protection in accordance with the above policies and principles. The unsafe and unsanitary conditions left over from old China in enterprises have been greatly changed, and the rates of casualties and occupational diseases have also declined. However, at present, some enterprises and their competent departments still do not pay enough attention to implementing the policy of safe production, and the country also lacks unified labor protection regulations and a complete supervision system. Therefore, labor protection work is far from meeting the needs of the development of production and construction, and there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently. For example, some enterprises have not seriously established a responsibility system for safe production. When inspecting and deploying production work, they often neglect to inspect and deploy safety work; some enterprises not only do not actively solve the problem of safety and health equipment, but even mistakenly divert safety technical measures funds for other purposes; some enterprises only one-sidedly emphasize the completion of production tasks, ignoring the safety and health of workers, and indiscriminately work overtime; some enterprises mistakenly understand "breaking with convention" as meaning that operating procedures are unnecessary, and individual grassroots leaders even take the lead in violating procedures and taking risks; some enterprises, after work-related injuries and deaths occur, lack serious analysis, serious handling, and the adoption of necessary improvement measures. This is a bureaucratic attitude of indifference to the interests of the working masses, and it is a fundamental violation of the management principles of socialist enterprises.
In order to further implement the policy of safe production and strengthen labor protection work to meet the needs of socialist construction, the State Council now formulates the "Factory Safety and Health Regulations," the "Construction and Installation Engineering Safety Technical Regulations," and the "Regulations on Reporting Work-Related Injuries and Deaths of Workers and Staff," and will issue them for implementation.
All enterprises and their competent departments should earnestly implement the various provisions of these regulations. In the process of implementing the "Factory Safety and Health Regulations" and the "Construction and Installation Engineering Safety Technical Regulations," each enterprise or its competent department may formulate separate detailed rules based on the regulations and in light of specific circumstances. After the "Regulations on Reporting Work-Related Injuries and Deaths of Workers and Staff" are issued and implemented, the "Measures for Reporting Work-Related Injuries and Deaths of Employees in Industrial, Transportation, and Construction Enterprises" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on December 31, 1951, should be abolished.
All competent departments and enterprises must organize administrative management personnel, engineering and technical personnel at all levels to study and research these regulations, check the existing problems in accordance with the spirit of the documents, and formulate specific implementation methods; and regularly conduct inspections and supervision from top to bottom to ensure implementation. If some enterprises currently have difficulties in implementing certain clauses of the "Factory Safety and Health Regulations" and the "Construction and Installation Engineering Safety Technical Regulations," they may postpone the implementation time after obtaining the consent of the grassroots trade union and being reviewed and approved by the local labor department; however, they must actively create conditions and gradually seek to achieve them.
Labor departments at all levels must strengthen regular supervision and inspection work, summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner, and strive for the implementation of these regulations.
Trade union organizations at all levels should widely carry out publicity and education among the workers and staff, so that the workers and staff care about and supervise the implementation of these regulations, and fight against all behaviors that disregard and violate the regulations.

    国务院关于发布“工厂安全卫生规程”、“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”和“工人职员伤亡事故报告规程”的决议
    （1956年5月25日国务院全体会议第29次会议通过）
    改善劳动条件，保护劳动者在生产中的安全和健康，是我们国家的一项重要政策，也是社会主义企业管理的基本原则之一。几年来，国民经济各部门、各企业根据上述政策和原则，在劳动保护方面做了许多工作，旧中国遗留在企业中的不安全、不卫生的情况已经有了很大改变，伤亡事故、职业疾病的比率也都有了下降。但是，目前某些企业和企业主管部门对贯彻安全生产的方针仍然重视不够，同时国家还缺乏统一的劳动保护法规和完整的监察制度，因此劳动保护工作还远不能赶上生产建设发展的需要，并且存在着一些亟待解决的问题，例如有的企业还没有认真地建立全安生产的责任制度，在检查和布置生产工作的时候，常常忽视检查和布置安全工作；有的企业非但不去积极解决安全卫生的设备问题，甚至错误地将安全技术措施经费移作他用；有的企业只片面强调完成生产任务，不注意工人的安全和健康，滥行加班加点；有的企业把“打破常规”错误地理解为可以不要操作规程，个别基层领导人员甚至带头违反规程，冒险作业；有的企业在发生伤亡事故以后，缺乏认真分析、严肃处理和采取必要的改进措施。这是对于工人群众利益漠不关心的官僚主义态度，是根本违反社会主义企业的管理原则的。
    为了进一步贯彻安全生产的方针，加强劳动保护工作，以适应社会主义建设的需要，国务院现在制定“工厂安全卫生规程”、“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”和“工人职员伤亡事故报告规程”，并即发布施行。
    各企业单位和它们的主管部门都应该切实执行这些规程的各项规定。在实施“工厂安全卫生规程”和“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”的过程中，各企业或者它们的主管部门可以根据规程，结合具体情况，制定单行的细则。在“工人职员伤亡事故报告规程”发布施行以后，原政务院财政经济委员会1951年12月31日发布的“工业交通及建筑企业职工伤亡事故报告办法”应该废止。
    各企业主管部门和企业单位必须组织各级行政管理人员、工程技术人员学习和研究这些规程，根据文件的精神，检查目前存在的问题，订出具体贯彻执行的办法；并且由上而下地经常进行检查督促，保证实行。某些企业对于“工厂安全卫生规程”和“建筑安装工程安全技术规程”的某项条款，如果目前执行确实有困难的时候，在取得基层工会同意，并且经当地劳动部门审查认可后，可以推迟执行的时间；但须积极创造条件，逐步求得实现。
    各级劳动部门必须加强经常的监督和检查工作，及时地总结和交流经验，为这些规程的贯彻实施而努力。
    各级工会组织应该广泛地向职工群众进行宣传教育，使职工群众关心和监督这些规程的实施，向一切漠视和违反规程的行为进行斗争。
