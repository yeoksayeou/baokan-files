Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th. Gansu Province has recently commended and rewarded a large number of Communist Party members and Party organizations. In twenty-nine counties (cities) including Pingliang, Wuzhong, and Wushan, as well as seven units including Yumen Oil Mine and Lanzhou General Machinery Factory, 498 party members, 99 branches, 9 general branches, and 18 district committees have been commended and rewarded.

The Party members and Party organizations that have been commended and rewarded have all made outstanding achievements in their work. The Changba District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Kang County, this spring, led the masses to overfulfill the annual water conservancy construction task in twenty-five days. They also worked with the masses to find fertilizer sources, mobilizing them to accumulate more than 17 million catties of fertilizer. This district is creating conditions in all aspects to strive to become a "thousand-catty district" this year. In Tongxin County, Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture, the driest area in the province, the Seventh District Committee of the Communist Party of China led the masses to create "Lian'er Wells," increasing the irrigation area from 0.2 mu to 2 mu per day, which rapidly developed the district's water conservancy work. Among the six outstanding party members selected by the General Branch of the Yumen Oil Mine Machinery Factory, some are representatives attending the National Advanced Producers' Representative Conference and the National Petroleum Industry Advanced Producers' Representative Conference, some are labor models, and one is the "Blower Elder," who has always emphasized safety in production and is deeply loved by the masses.

This commendation and reward of outstanding Party members and Party organizations has set an example for Party members and non-Party masses throughout the province, and promoted the work. After Li Chengcai, a Party member from Minle Township, Zhongwei County, was commended as an outstanding Party member, he led more than 60 commune members to reclaim wasteland in the Nanshan Mountains, reclaiming 3,600 mu of grassland in thirty-five days. Through the evaluation of outstanding Party members, the Lanzhou Materials Factory of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, more than 90% of Party members and more than 80% of non-Party masses have formulated their own production and study plans and personal guarantees for achieving the plans. Wang Kaiguo and other six Party members from the Yumen Oil Mine Machinery Factory proposed the initiative to complete the annual production task three months ahead of schedule, which was responded to by the majority of workers in the factory.

    甘肃省表扬和奖励大批党员和党组织
    新华社兰州11日电　甘肃省有大批共产党员和党组织最近受到表扬和奖励。平凉、吴忠、武山等二十九个县（市）及玉门油矿、兰州通用机器厂等七个单位受到表扬和奖励的党员有498名、支部九十九个、总支九个、区委会十八个。
    受到表扬和奖励的党员和党组织，在工作中都曾经作出优异的成绩。中共康县长坝区委员会，今春领导群众在二十五天内超额完成了全年兴修水利的任务，他们还和群众一道想办法找肥源，动员群众积了一千七百多万斤肥料，这个区正从各方面创造条件争取今年成为千斤区。在全省最干旱的吴忠回族自治州同心县，中共七区委员会领导群众创造了“连二井”，由一天浇地二分提高到二亩，使这个区的水利工作得到迅速发展。玉门油矿机械厂总支选出的六名优秀党员中，有的是出席全国先进生产者代表会议和全国石油工业先进生产者代表会议的代表，有的是劳动模范，有一名是一向重视安全生产、深受群众爱戴的“鼓风老人”。
    这次对优秀党员和党组织的表扬和奖励，给全省党员和非党群众树立了榜样，推动了工作。中卫县民乐乡党员李成才在表扬优秀党员以后，带领六十多名社员到南山开荒，在三十五天中开垦草地三千六百亩。铁道部第一工程局兰州材料厂通过评选优秀党员，90％以上党员和80％以上非党群众订出了自己的生产、学习规划和实现规划的个人保证书。玉门油矿机械厂党员王开国等六人，提出提前三个月完成全年生产任务的倡议，受到全厂大多数职工的响应。
