Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 7th. Major General Ding Rongchang, a leader of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, said to Li Zhaosheng, Li Xiaozhuang and others: "Those who are still in the remnants of Chiang's troops, as long as they are willing to return to the country and reunite with their families, can follow your example. They will be welcomed by the people of the motherland just like you." He said this on the 6th when he received these twenty-five former Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from Burma who revolted.

Li Zhaosheng and others reported to Major General Ding Rongchang about their living conditions in the remnants of Chiang's troops and their impressions after returning to China. They said: In these years in Burma, we suffered all kinds of hardships. We all have no intention of following Chiang Kai-shek any longer, and only want to find an opportunity to return and meet our families. After returning to China, all the way from the border to Kunming, we saw that the farmers everywhere had food to eat, and the clothes they wore were much better than before, which we had not expected before. These revolting personnel also happily said to Major General Ding Rongchang: We have already written letters to our families, sent photos, and told our relatives that we will be able to meet soon.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 7th. Li Anjie, a military doctor with the rank of major from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, told reporters that most of the twenty-five former Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from Burma who revolted, including Li Zhaosheng, suffer from chronic diseases and are currently receiving treatment. The condition of many patients has improved.

Li Anjie said that after Li Zhaosheng and others arrived in Kunming, the military doctors conducted a comprehensive physical examination for them. The results showed that some of the twenty-five people suffered from four or five diseases at the same time, including eighteen people with malaria parasites, nineteen people with dysentery, gastrointestinal diseases, malnutrition, rheumatism and other diseases, and twelve people with anemia.

    昆明驻军首长接见逃缅蒋军起义人员
    新华社昆明7日电　中国人民解放军驻昆明部队首长丁荣昌少将对李召生、李小壮等说：“现在还在蒋军残部里的人，只要愿意回国和亲人团聚，都可以效法你们的榜样。他们都会像你们一样受到祖国人民的欢迎。”这是他在六日接见这二十五名逃缅蒋军起义人员时候说的。
    李召生等向丁荣昌少将报告了他们在蒋军残部里的生活情况和回国后的观感。他们说：我们在缅甸的这几年中，吃尽了各种苦头，大家都无心再跟着蒋介石下去，只想找机会回来和亲人见面。我们回国后，从边疆到昆明的一路上，看到到处的农民都有粮食吃，穿的衣服也比以前好得多了，这都是我们以前没有想到的。这些起义人员们还高兴地对丁荣昌少将说：我们都已经给家里写了信，寄了照片，并且告诉家里的亲人们：不久就可以见面了。
    据新华社昆明7日电　中国人民解放军驻昆明某部军医少校李安杰对记者说，起义回国的逃缅蒋军人员李召生等二十五人大部分患有慢性疾病，目前正在治疗中。许多患者的病情都有了好转。
