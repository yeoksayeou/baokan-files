Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. After cotton-growing farmers diligently inspected and replanted seedlings in their fields, over six million hectares of cotton fields nationwide are now showing excellent seedling growth, completing and surpassing this year's cotton planting area plan. Cotton farmers in various regions have begun thinning seedlings in the cotton fields.

This year, cotton-producing regions went through a struggle to ensure full and thriving seedlings. Because the cotton sowing season in most cotton-growing areas across the country was earlier than in previous years, the ground temperature was low, and there was more rainfall before and after sowing, resulting in soil compaction. These conditions affected the emergence of cotton seedlings, and their growth was not complete. At the same time, some cotton-growing areas experienced varying degrees of diseases and insect pests due to low ground temperatures and high soil moisture. Party and government leading bodies and agricultural departments then promptly led farmers to actively carry out soil loosening, cultivation, and other work; and promptly implemented measures such as seedling inspection, replanting, and transplanting. Widespread chemical and manual control measures were also carried out on cotton fields with diseases and insect pests. After May 20th, the missing seedlings in cotton fields in various cotton-producing areas had been replanted, and the incidence of diseases and insect pests also showed a downward trend.

Currently, cotton fields in various regions have basically achieved full stands. In Shanxi Province, after inspecting and replanting seedlings in over five million mu of cotton fields, each mu has reached more than 7,000 plants, and irrigated cotton fields have reached about 6,000 plants per mu. In Hebei Province, after inspecting and replanting seedlings, the requirements for full stands and dense planting have also been met. The 12 million mu of cotton fields in Jiangsu Province are basically fully planted. At present, farmers in various cotton-producing areas are actively carrying out thinning, fixing seedlings, cultivating, weeding, and topdressing.

    全国六百多万公顷棉田达到苗全苗旺
    新华社6日讯　经过棉区农民对棉田努力查田补苗，现在全国有六百多万公顷棉田棉苗生长很好，完成并且超过了今年的种棉面积的计划。各地棉农已经开始为棉田定苗。
    今年各产棉区为保证达到苗全苗旺是经过一番斗争的。由于全国大部棉区棉花播种时节比往年早，地温低，加以播种前后雨量较多，因此产生了土壤板结现象。这些情况影响了棉苗出土、生长不够齐全，同时部分棉区还因地温低、土壤湿气大而引起了或多或少病害和虫害。各地党、政领导机关和农业部门就随即领导农民积极进行松土、中耕等工作；并且及时进行了查苗补苗和移栽等措施。对有病、虫患害的棉田也普遍展开了药剂和人工防治。到五月二十日以后，各产棉区的缺苗棉田就已经补齐，病虫患害也有下降趋势。
    现在，各地棉田已基本达到全苗。山西省五百多万亩棉田经过查苗、补苗以后，每亩达到了七千株以上，灌溉棉田每亩也达到六千株左右；河北省经过查苗、补苗以后，也已经达到了全苗密植要求；江苏省一千二百万亩棉田基本上全苗。目前，各产棉区农民，正在积极进行间苗、定苗、中耕、耨草和追肥工作。
