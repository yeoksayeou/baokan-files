Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, replied to FIFA today, stating that the Chinese football team, which has qualified for the 16th Olympic Games football finals, is actively preparing to participate in the Olympic football competition to be held in Melbourne in November this year.

In his letter, Rong Gaotang stated that the All-China Sports Federation had received a letter from FIFA Secretary-General Gassmann officially notifying the Chinese football team of its qualification for the finals. In the letter, Gassmann stated that the FIFA Olympic Committee had decided that the Chinese football team was qualified to participate in the Melbourne Games.

In his letter, Rong Gaotang stated: "Although we regret that the China-Philippines Olympic football preliminary round could not be realized, we are satisfied with FIFA's reasonable decision."

It was previously reported that the Chinese football team qualified to participate in the Melbourne Games because the Philippine football team failed to arrive in Calcutta on time to participate in the China-Philippines football preliminary round, as stipulated by FIFA.

    我国体育总会回信给国际足球联合会
    我国足球队正积极为参加奥林匹克的比赛作准备
    新华社4日讯　中华全国体育总会秘书长荣高棠今天回信给国际足球联合会说，已经获得第十六届奥林匹克运动会足球决赛权的中国足球队，正积极为参加今年十一月间在墨尔本举行的奥林匹克足球比赛作准备。
    荣高棠在信中说，中华全国体育总会已经收到国际足球联合会秘书长加斯曼正式通知中国足球队获得决赛权的一封信。加斯曼在这封信中说，国际足球联合会奥林匹克委员会已经做出决定：中国足球队获得了参加墨尔本比赛的资格。
    荣高棠在信中表示：“尽管我们对中、菲奥林匹克足球预选赛没有能够实现感到遗憾，但是我们对国际足球联合会的合理决议表示满意。”
    前已报道，中国足球队获得参加墨尔本比赛的资格，是由于菲律宾足球队没有根据国际足球联合会的规定按期到加尔各答参加中国同菲律宾的足球预选赛。
