    General Twining's Visit and the American Iron Curtain
    This year, on June 24th, the Soviet Union's annual Aviation Day will have many new guests invited to visit. Among these guests is U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Twining.
    General Twining's invitation has caused quite a stir in the United States.
    Originally, the Soviet invitation included not only General Twining but also other Pentagon leaders, but the U.S. government only approved General Twining. Any more than that was said to be "impractical."
    According to American news reports, General Twining's invitation has already been considered serious enough.
    The reactions are varied.
    U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Russell said that it is a good thing for senior U.S. military generals to visit the Soviet Union. According to Agence France-Presse, some people in Washington believe that "this is a possible turning point in U.S.-Soviet relations."
    It should be said that these are some relatively calm and realistic estimates.
    Unfortunately, there are not many people in American political circles who make positive and optimistic estimates of General Twining's invitation to visit the Soviet Union. To understand the reason for this, it is worth recalling some of the twists and turns revealed by the American news agencies.
    When the State Department received the news of the invitation, Dulles went to his secluded villa on Duck Island in Lake Ontario for a vacation. Before leaving, Dulles said that the United States would consider the invitation in a "leisurely manner."
    United Press said: "This is diplomatic rhetoric." What Dulles needed time to do was to "rack his brains to find a satisfactory way to say 'no!'"
    Regarding this strange attitude towards a friendly invitation, the Associated Press provided an explanation, saying that Dulles felt "anxious" about the invitation because "this indication of intimacy between Washington and Moscow could become another force for dangerous laxity in the free world."
    Dulles was not the only one who publicly expressed this "anxiety."
    Air Force Secretary Quarles frankly said: "The serious danger is... that we might be seduced into a false sense of security."
    Army Secretary Brucker also insisted that the Soviet invitation might contain "deception," so he requested that "we be a little careful about this matter."
    Senate Republican Leader Knowland even shouted loudly that this "would be harmful." He feared that accepting the invitation would increase the "pressure" to approve contact between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union.
    From this, it seems that some very powerful people in the United States are very uninterested and even annoyed by this friendly visit.
    However, United Press was right in its prediction that it would be difficult to find a "satisfactory" way to reject the invitation. General Twining's invitation was finally approved.
    Now there is another saying. The Associated Press's international news analyst Ryan analyzed that this decision would allow the United States to "gain a lot": one "gain" is that "it can help to show the world that the United States is calm and comfortable about the prospect of competing with the Soviet Union in any field, and there is no benefit in giving the impression that the United States is afraid of this contact"; another "gain" is that this will prove that the claim that "it is not the Soviet Union but the United States that maintains... the Iron Curtain" is unfounded.
    People welcome the United States to truly be able to show its goodwill towards developing international friendly exchanges as Mr. Ryan said. This will be a gain not only for the United States but also for world peace.
    However, people mention the fact that recently, a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives even refused to consider such a reasonable issue as abolishing the fingerprinting entry procedure. The establishment of this insulting procedure is intended to prevent foreigners from visiting the United States, and to put up the so-called iron curtain that Americans themselves love to talk about around the United States.
    French Foreign Minister Pineau, who is currently visiting the United States, mentioned this iron curtain before his visit to the United States. He said that he wanted to explain to the United States that maintaining the iron curtain "is absolutely stupid." Regardless of what intentions Pineau had in saying this, he at least affirmed that the iron curtain is in the United States, and the United States is still very unwilling to remove it.

### 特文宁将军的访问和美国铁幕

    特文宁将军的访问和美国铁幕
    今年，六月二十四日，苏联一年一度举行的航空节，将有好多新的客人应邀参观。在这些客人中，有美国空军参谋长特文宁将军。
    特文宁将军的应邀，在美国引起了不小的轰动。
    原来，在苏联的请帖中，不止特文宁将军一人，还有五角大楼其他首脑人物，但美国政府只批准了特文宁将军一个。再多一个，据说就是“不切合实际”了。
    根据美国消息的报道看来，特文宁将军的应邀已经被认为是够严重的了。
    反应是多种多样的。
    美国参议院军事委员会主席鲁塞尔说，美国高级军事将领访问苏联，是一件好事。据法新社讯，华盛顿还有人认为，“这是美苏关系中的一个可能的转折点。”
    应该说，这是一些比较冷静、现实的估计。
    可惜，对特文宁应邀访苏一事作积极和乐观估计的，在美国政界人士中还远不是很多的。为了明了此中原委，不妨回溯一下美国通讯社所透露的某些曲折。
    当国务院得到邀请的消息以后，杜勒斯到安大略湖鸭岛他的幽静的别墅度假期去了。杜勒斯在行前说，美国将以“不慌不忙的方式考虑这项邀请”。
    合众社说：“这是外交辞令”。杜勒斯需要有时间搜索枯肠的是“找到一种令人满意的办法说‘不去！’”。
    关于这种对待友好邀请的奇怪态度，美联社提供了一个解释，它说：杜勒斯对这项邀请感到“焦虑”，因为“这种表明华盛顿和莫斯科之间的亲昵的迹象，可能成为使自由世界发生危险的松懈现象的另一种力量”。
    公开表示这种“焦虑”的人，不是杜勒斯一个。
    空军部长卡利斯就坦率地说：“严重的危险是……可能诱骗我们产生一种虚假的安全感”。
    陆军部长布鲁克也硬说，苏联的邀请可能含有“诡诈”，因此，他要求“对这件事情稍为小心些”。
    参议院共和党领袖诺兰更大叫大喊说：这“将是有害的”。他害怕如果接受邀请会增加赞成美苏两国领导人的接触的“压力”。
    由此看来，美国一些很有权势的人对这种友好访问是非常不感兴趣甚至是很恼火的。
    不过，还是合众社预计对了，它认为要找出“令人满意的”办法来拒绝邀请是困难的。特文宁将军的应邀，终于批准了。
    现在有了另一种说法。美联社的国际新闻分析员瑞安分析说，这个决定会使美国“可以有很多收获”：一个“收获”是
  “可以有助于向世界表明，美国对于苏联在任何方面竞争的前景是抱着镇静而舒畅的态度的，给人以美国害怕这种接触的印象是没有任何好处的”；另一个“收获”是，这会证明有人认为“不是苏联而是美国保持着……铁幕”的说法是没有根据的。
    人们欢迎美国真正能够像瑞安先生所说的那样表明自己对于发展国际友好交往的善意。这不仅对美国，而且对世界和平都将是一种收获。
    可是，人们提到这样的事实：最近，美国众议院的一个委员会甚至拒绝考虑像取消捺手印的入境手续这样合理的问题。订出这个侮辱性的手续来，就是存心不要外国人到美国进行访问，就是在美国周围挂起美国人自己最爱说的那种所谓铁幕。
    现在正在美国的法国外长比诺在赴美访问前就提到了这张铁幕。他说，他要向美国说明：保持铁幕“是绝对愚蠢的。”且不论比诺这番话有他自己的什么用意，他至少肯定了，铁幕是在美国，而且美国到现在还很不愿意把它卸去。
