    Immediately Plant Summer Crops Well
    The summer planting season in the northern regions has arrived. Seizing the opportunity to complete the sowing of summer crops is a major task in current agricultural production. In previous years, the summer planting area in the northern regions has been approximately 400 million mu, nearly one-quarter of the country's cultivated land. This year, the summer planting area in this region has increased by more than 10 million mu compared to last year. The quality of summer crop planting has always been an important factor in whether the northern regions can achieve a full harvest for the year.
    During the spring planting season this year, some regions, due to a one-sided emphasis on increasing the production of cotton and grain, neglected the planting of other technical crops and failed to complete the state's comprehensive planting plan. In these regions, some oil crops were not planted sufficiently, and the planting of minor grains, vegetables, and melons was not arranged. If this situation is not changed, it will have a very negative impact on the lives of urban and rural people. Summer crops are diverse, including oil crops such as peanuts and sesame, various minor grains, and vegetables and melons, all of which can be planted in the summer to make up for the deficiencies in spring planting. Rural cadres and farmers in the northern regions should take advantage of the summer planting opportunity to systematically replant those crops that should have been planted but were not, especially oil crops such as peanuts and sesame, and strive to comprehensively complete the state's planting plan.
    Summer crops have a short growing season, and only by planting early can a good harvest be obtained. Farmers often say, "Summer planting, one night early is one fist taller," which illustrates this point. The Baiquan Farm in Henan Province conducted a corn experiment, which showed that planting ten days before the Summer Solstice increased production by 22% compared to planting on the Summer Solstice, and planting ten days after the Summer Solstice reduced production by 30% compared to planting on the Summer Solstice. Last year, the Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, planted 162 mu of soybeans, yielding 340 jin per mu, which was more than double the yield of ordinary soybeans in the area. One of the important reasons for this was that they were planted earlier than ordinary soybeans. This spring, some regions experienced seed rotting and uneven emergence due to planting too early. As a result, some people have concerns about early planting. In fact, that phenomenon was caused by planting too early this year and the low temperatures this spring. The temperature is very high during the summer planting season, and early planting will never cause seed rotting or uneven emergence. Summer planting season has always been a busy time for agricultural work. For many years, individual farmers often could not plant on time due to insufficient labor. The problem here is often not too early, but too late. This year, agricultural cooperation has been realized nationwide, and the problem of insufficient labor has been basically solved. We should make full use of this favorable condition and try to advance the planting period as much as possible.
    However, summer planting is, after all, carried out under very tight agricultural work conditions. Even in agricultural production cooperatives, it is necessary to properly allocate manpower and animal power, and appropriately arrange various field operations in order to successfully complete this major task. During the spring planting season this year, some agricultural cooperatives had not yet established quota management and contract labor systems, resulting in a phenomenon of no one being responsible for work and chaotic dispatching and recording of labor, which seriously affected the progress and quality of planting. All agricultural cooperatives must learn from this lesson, strengthen and rectify labor organization, uniformly arrange the agricultural work of the entire cooperative, and do the summer planting work quickly and well.
    Summer crops have a short growing time, require early planting, and must ensure full emergence. Therefore, in addition to organizing labor well and accelerating the planting progress, it is also necessary to prepare seeds and fertilizers properly, and strive to avoid possible uneven emergence and re-planting. During the spring planting season this year, some regions did not have enough seeds, and the quality was not high, which hindered the timely progress of spring planting. This lesson should be well learned in summer planting. Currently, many peanut-producing areas are seriously lacking peanut seeds. The county and district party and government leading organs in various regions should immediately organize the agricultural production cooperatives to adjust with each other. Local oil companies should also assume certain tasks and supply farmers with some peanut seeds. The fertilizer prepared in various places this year is generally abundant, but most of it has been used during spring planting. Now, various methods should be adopted to replenish the fertilizer needed for summer planting.
    There is a saying popular in our countryside: "One cannot ignore the autumn harvest just because of seeing the seeds." This means that some farmers may become lax about summer planting because of the good wheat harvest, which is very wrong. This year, various places have had good wheat harvests, and some farmers have indeed developed this kind of emotion. They concentrate all their attention on summer harvesting and distribution and do not pay attention to summer planting. Everyone should be happy about the good wheat harvest. Everyone should give sufficient attention to summer harvesting and distribution. However, the yield of summer-sown crops in northern China is often no less than that of wheat. It is naturally wrong to focus on the wheat that has already been harvested and abandon the summer crops that are yet to be obtained. If the summer harvesting and distribution work is not done well, the farmers' enthusiasm for summer planting will be affected; if the summer planting work is not done well, it will cause irreparable losses to the year's harvest. It is necessary to combine these two tasks during the busy summer season, taking both into consideration and doing both well at the same time.
    At present, most areas have abundant rainfall and good soil moisture, and natural conditions are very favorable for early planting. Agricultural leading departments in various places should seize this important opportunity, mobilize all forces that can be mobilized, and actively lead and help farmers to plant summer crops well as soon as possible. All farmers should act immediately, complete the summer planting task well, and strive for a comprehensive harvest this year.

### 立即种好夏播作物

    立即种好夏播作物
    北方地区的夏种季节已经到来，抓紧时机完成夏播作物的播种，是当前农业生产中的一件大事。历年来北方地区的夏播面积约有四亿亩，将近全国耕地面积的四分之一；今年这个地区的夏播面积，又比去年增加一千多万亩。夏播作物种得好坏，从来都是北方地区全年能否丰收的重要因素。
    今年春季播种的时候，不少地区由于片面地强调增产棉粮，忽视了别的技术作物的播种，没有完成国家的全面种植计划。这些地区，有的油料作物没有种够，有的没有安排小杂粮和蔬菜、瓜类的种植。这种情况如不加以改变，就会对城乡人民的生活造成很不好的影响。夏播作物是多种多样的，花生、芝麻等油料，各种小杂粮和蔬菜、瓜类，都可以在夏季播种，弥补春季播种的不足。北方地区的农村工作干部和农民，应该利用夏种的机会，有准备地补种那些应种未种的作物，特别是花生、芝麻等油料作物，争取全面地完成国家的种植计划。
    夏播作物生长时期较短，只有提早播种，才能得到丰收。农民常说：“夏种田，早一宿高一拳”，就是这个道理。河南省百泉农场曾经作过玉米试验，“夏至”前十天种的比“夏至”种的增产22％；“夏至”后十天种的比“夏至”种的减产30％。去年山东省寿张县胜利农业生产合作社种的162亩大豆，每亩收获三百四十斤，比当地一般大豆的产量高一倍以上，其中一个很重要的原因，就是比一般大豆种的早。今年春季，有些地区由于种的较早，曾经发生种籽腐烂、出苗不齐的现象。有些人于是对提早播种发生一些顾虑。其实，那种现象是今年播种过早和今春气温较低造成的。夏种季节气温很高，提早播种绝不会发生烂种和出苗不齐的现象。夏播季节农活一向拥挤，多少年来，个体农民常因劳力不足而不能如期播种，这里发生的问题常常不是过早而是过迟。今年农业合作化已在全国范围实现，劳力不足的问题基本上已经解决。我们应该充分运用这个有利条件，尽量提早播种期。
    但是，夏季播种毕竟是在农活十分紧张的情况下进行的，就是在农业生产合作社中，也必须很好地调配人力、畜力，恰当地安排各种田间作业，才能顺利完成这个重大任务。今年春季播种的时候，有些农业合作社还没有建立定额管理和包工包产制度，形成工作无人负责和派工记工混乱的现象，严重地影响了播种进度和播种质量。各个农业合作社都要吸取这个教训，加强和整顿劳动组织，统一安排全社的农活，把夏播工作做得又快又好。
    夏播作物生长时间较短，需要及早播种，并且保证全苗。因此，除了应该很好地组织劳动，加速播种进度以外，还必须把种籽、肥料准备妥当，极力避免可能发生的出苗不齐、返工补种的现象。今年春播的时候，有些地区种籽数量不够，质量不高，妨碍了春播的如期进行，这种教训要在夏播中很好地接受。现在许多花生产区严重地缺乏花生种子，各个地区的县、区党政领导机关，应该立即组织各农业生产合作社互相调剂。各地油脂公司也应该担负一定的任务，供应农民部分花生种子。今年各地准备的肥料一般很多，但多数已在春播时候用了；现在应该采用各种方法，把夏播时候需要的肥料补充起来。
    我国农村中流行一种说法：“不能见籽不顾秋”。意思是说，麦子丰收了，有些农民会对夏种产生松懈现象，这是很不应该的。今年各地小麦丰收，有些农民确实产生了这种情绪，他们把全部注意力集中于夏收分配，对夏种反不注意了。小麦丰收，大家应该高兴。夏收分配，大家应该给以足够的重视。但是，我国北方地区夏播庄稼的产量，常常并不低于小麦的产量。把眼光集中在已经到手的小麦，放弃尚待争取的夏种庄稼，自然是错误的。不把夏收分配工作做好，农民夏种的积极性就会受到影响；不把夏种工作做好，会给全年的收成造成不可弥补的损失。一定要在夏季繁忙时候，把这两种工作结合起来，双方兼顾，同时作好。
    目前大部地区雨量充沛，墒情很好，自然条件对提早播种十分有利。各地农业领导部门应该抓紧这一重要时机，动员一切可以动员的力量，积极领导和帮助农民尽快地把夏播作物种好。全体农民应该立即行动起来，很好地完成夏播任务，争取今年的全面丰收。
