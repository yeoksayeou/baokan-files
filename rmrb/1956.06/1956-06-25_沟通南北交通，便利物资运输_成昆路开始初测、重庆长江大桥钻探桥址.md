    Connecting North-South Transportation, Facilitating Material Transport
    Chengdu-Kunming Railway Begins Initial Survey, Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge Drills Bridge Site
    (Our report) The initial survey of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway has begun. The staff of the 16th Comprehensive Detachment of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, who are responsible for the survey of the northern section of the line between Chengdu and Emei, have arrived at the construction site in early June. They are now hacking through the bushes and thorns in the Xinjin and Pengshan areas to carry out surveying and mapping.
    The initial survey of the southern section of the railway, the 370-kilometer stretch from Kunming to Taipingdi, will also begin in mid-July. At present, the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways has sent selection engineers to the southern section for on-site surveys. It is expected that the initial survey and preliminary design of approximately 520 kilometers of the northern and southern sections can be completed within this year.
    The Chengdu-Kunming Railway is one of the main north-south trunk lines in China's railway network and the longest trunk line in the southwest region. Its northern end starts from Chengdu Hub Station (connecting with the Baoji-Chengdu and Chengdu-Chongqing Railways), passes through Xinjin and Emei, extends southwest along the Dadu River, reaches Xichang, and then goes south along the Anning River into Yunnan Province, directly reaching Kunming. It is approximately 1,060 kilometers long. There are large reserves of iron, coal, and non-ferrous metals along the line.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd) Another large bridge over the Yangtze River—the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge—has fully launched drilling and surveying work at the bridge site.
    Currently, three bridge sites have been determined for drilling and surveying for the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge, and the last borehole of the first bridge site is now being drilled. Since construction began in early May, 90% of the drilling work at this bridge site has been completed. Before October this year, the drilling and surveying work for all three bridge sites will be completed, and a design proposal for the bridge will be submitted. At that time, the bridge site for the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge can be selected and determined.
    Chongqing will be a hub for several railway lines, such as the Chengdu-Chongqing and Sichuan-Guizhou lines, and is also an important industrial city that is constantly developing. After the successful construction of the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge, it will connect the various railway lines, making the transportation of materials between South China and the Northwest smooth and unimpeded. At the same time, it will greatly facilitate the internal and external transportation of industrial raw materials and products in the Chongqing area, as well as water-land combined transportation. For example, the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, which is currently under construction on the south bank of the Yangtze River, can be connected to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on the north bank through the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge. In the future, materials transported from Zhanjiang Port, a seaport in southern China, can be transported all the way to the Northwest region through the Lizhan, Xianggui, Qian-Gui, Chuan-Qian, Cheng-Yu, and Bao-Cheng Railways.

    沟通南北交通，便利物资运输
    成昆路开始初测、重庆长江大桥钻探桥址
    本报讯　成（都）昆（明）铁路开始初测。担任北段成都到峨嵋间线路勘测工作的铁道部第二设计院第十六综合分队的职工，已经在六月上旬到达工地。现在，他们正在新津、彭山一带劈荆斩棘地进行测绘。
    这条铁路的南段昆明至太平地三百七十公里的初测，也将在七月中旬开始。目前，铁道部第二设计院已经派出选线工程师赴南段现场勘察。预计在今年之内可以完成南北两段约五百二十公里的初测和初步设计。
    成昆铁路是我国铁路网中纵贯南北的主要干线之一，也是西南地区最长的一条干线。它的北端起自成都枢纽站（和宝成、成渝两铁路连接），经新津、峨嵋，沿大渡河向西南伸展，到达西昌，再沿安宁河南下进入云南省境内直抵昆明。全长约一千零六十公里。沿线铁、煤和有色金属蕴藏量很大。
    据新华社重庆23日电　长江上的另一座大桥——重庆长江大桥，全面展开桥址的钻探和测量工作。
    重庆长江大桥目前确定钻探和测量的桥址共有三个，现在是开始钻探第一个桥址的最后一个钻孔。这个桥址从五月初开工以来，已完成钻探工作量的90％。今年十月份前，三个桥址的钻探和测量工作将全部完成，并提出大桥的设计意见书。这时，重庆长江大桥的桥址就可以选择确定了。
    重庆将来是成渝、川黔等好几条铁路线的枢纽地，也是一个不断发展的重要工业城市。重庆长江大桥修建成功后，就可把各条铁路连接起来，使华南、西北各地物资运输畅通无阻；同时，使重庆地区工业原料和产品的内外运输与水陆联运十分便利。如正在修建的川黔铁路在长江南岸，它通过重庆长江大桥，就可和北岸的成渝路联接。将来从我国南方海港——湛江港运进的物资，可通过黎湛、湘桂、黔桂、川黔、成渝、宝成等铁路，一直运到西北地区。
