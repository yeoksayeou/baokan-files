I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the explanations of Minister Liao Luyan.

This year's national budget, while prioritizing the development of heavy industry, appropriately increases investment in agriculture, light industry, transportation, and cultural and scientific undertakings, and reduces the proportion of investment in national defense. This powerfully expresses the overall appearance of national construction and the state's unparalleled concern for the people's lives, while also reflecting our people's desire for peace and the strength of our national defense. The model regulations (draft) for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives that we are about to pass are the regulations for the broad masses of the countryside to build a socialist society. With them, we can guarantee the faster development and improvement of the agricultural cooperation movement. I suggest that the congress approve the national budget and final accounts report and the model regulations (draft) for advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives.

Now, I would like to express some opinions on the highway construction and road transport in Hebei Province.

Since the founding of New China, highway construction and road transport in Hebei Province have developed to a certain extent. In 1949, there were only 4,204 kilometers of highways in the province. After several years of renovation and new construction, it reached 8,653 kilometers in 1955, an increase of more than double. The number of state-owned operating vehicles was only 130 in 1949, but reached 723 in 1955, an increase of 4.5 times. With the growth of highways and transportation vehicles, by the end of 1955, 336 transportation stations had been established throughout the province. Since studying Chairman Mao's instructions on "the question of agricultural cooperation," and criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking in our work, we have formulated a comprehensive plan for local transportation construction based on the principle of "overall planning and strengthened leadership," and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses. Highways and road transport have seen even greater development. From January to May of this year, a total of 866 kilometers of dirt roads were improved, and 2,426 kilometers of simple highways were newly built and rebuilt. Some major truck roads and pack animal roads have also been renovated with a focus. The socialist transformation of private transportation has also achieved a major victory. All private cars have been completely transformed into joint state-private enterprises. More than 95% of privately owned horse-drawn carts engaged in exclusive transportation have joined transportation cooperatives, except for those transferred to agricultural cooperatives. In the state-owned transportation sector, the socialist emulation campaign with "safety, economy, and 100,000 kilometers without major repairs" and the advanced producer movement as its main content has reached a climax, and the level of business management is rapidly improving.

These achievements should be affirmed, but if viewed from the perspective of the current needs of the entire national economic development, highway construction and road transport in Hebei Province are still very backward.

In terms of highway construction, the most important problem is the low quality of existing highways. Most of the original highways in Hebei Province were built during the period of Japanese and puppet rule for the purpose of plundering and slaughtering the people. Not only was the distribution extremely unreasonable, but there was no formal standard at all. In addition to war damage and years of disrepair, they were in ruins by the early days of liberation. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the province adopted the method of focusing on renovation, strengthening maintenance, and improving quality, so that most of the highways were restored to traffic. In recent years, according to the principle of "relying on the masses, using local materials, adapting to local conditions, and being applicable and economical," many new highways have been built and rebuilt. The development of highway construction has played a positive role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and supporting the increase in industrial and agricultural production. However, on the one hand, due to insufficient maintenance in peacetime, they were damaged as soon as they were repaired; on the other hand, most of the highways in Hebei Province are distributed in the plains, and because of the lack of a large amount of materials needed to improve the road surface, despite the mobilization of a large number of migrant workers for general repairs every spring and autumn, it is only possible to raise and widen the roadbed, but it is impossible to fundamentally improve the quality of the highway. On the surface, the province has 8,653 li of highways, but only 5% of them can be used in sunny and rainy weather. The rest are blocked by rain or even inaccessible for a long time during the rainy season. For example, the three highways of Bao (ding) Cang (county), Han (dan) Lin (qing), and Shi (jiazhuang) Nan (gong) De (zhou) are all major transportation lines across the cotton and grain producing areas of the province, and the transportation volume is very large; however, they are paralyzed every rainy season. During the rainy season, cities such as Shijiazhuang and Baoding cannot leave the city by car and are completely isolated from the countryside. This situation not only aggravates the seasonality and emergency nature of transportation and affects the exchange of materials, but also makes it inconvenient for troops to move. Mountain roads have also been improved with a focus in recent years in combination with the development of mountain construction, but most of them are still in a natural state, and transportation is extremely inconvenient.

Based on the above situation, I think: First of all, we must improve transportation work and fully rely on the masses. In the highway construction of previous years, the broad masses have shown great enthusiasm and creativity. Judging from the road construction situation from January to May this year, more than 3 million workdays and more than 400,000 vehicle days were involved in road construction throughout the province; many agricultural cooperatives have formed road construction teams to implement segmented contract repair and maintenance; in order to improve the road surface, the masses collected more than 780,000 cubic meters of various hard materials such as sand, stone, and slag; in terms of paving road surface operating technology, the masses also created the "plowing and mixing method," which greatly improved work efficiency and quality. These facts show that relying on and mobilizing the masses can make the highway better. However, to improve the quality of many dirt roads and reach the level of being able to travel in sunny and rainy weather or all year round, a large amount of hard materials is needed. However, the province's funds are insufficient and it is difficult to solve this problem. I hope the state will provide appropriate investment to the extent possible. Secondly, in order to do a better job in road maintenance. Road maintenance fees must be basically used for road maintenance. At present, because the relevant central departments have too strict control over road maintenance fees and there is little other investment, road maintenance fees are often used for basic construction, which has an impact on highway maintenance. In addition, the scope of national and provincial roads should also be clearly divided to facilitate management and maintenance.

In terms of road transport, the most important problem currently is the lack of transportation capacity. Hebei Province's modern transportation vehicles are not only small in number, but most of them are old and broken, and the transportation efficiency is low. In previous years, the task was mainly completed by civil animal-powered vehicles. According to last year's statistics, automobile transportation accounted for only 16% of the total road transport volume, and animal-powered vehicles accounted for 84%. Since this year, with the high tide of the socialist revolution, the transportation task has been unprecedentedly heavy, but 60% of the animal-powered vehicles originally engaged in transportation have turned to agricultural production. Therefore, a serious situation of material backlog has been created, which has greatly affected national construction and people's production and life.

In order to quickly change this situation, we have mainly taken the following measures: First, we have strived to improve the management methods of state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-operated vehicles, and tap potential; strengthened the organization and management of the transportation market, and unified the dispatch of transportation vehicles to overcome the imbalance in transportation. Second, in combination with the development of sideline production in agricultural cooperatives, we have vigorously organized them to participate in transportation, especially those vehicles that were originally mainly engaged in transportation. Not long ago, when I went to Tongxian, Tangshan, Tianjin and other regions to inspect the work, I saw that many transportation departments had signed transportation contracts with agricultural cooperatives, and adopted the method of fixed-term and quantitative, and segmented contracting for transportation, which can not only complete part of the transportation tasks, but also increase the income of agricultural cooperatives. However, it is also necessary to point out that the phenomenon of lack of transportation vehicles has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, from the perspective of development needs, the state should try to increase a certain number of cars in order to completely change the passive and backward situation of transportation work.

In addition, I would also like to add a few words about the supply of chemical fertilizers.

Hebei Province is rich in cotton and lacks food; the annual cotton output accounts for more than a quarter of the country, and the country needs to allocate billions of kilograms of grain every year. If Hebei Province can produce more cotton and be self-sufficient in food, it is necessary to increase the yield per unit area. One of the measures to increase the yield of cotton and grain is to apply more fertilizer. To solve the fertilizer problem, on the one hand, it is necessary to mobilize farmers to accumulate more coarse manure; on the other hand, it is also necessary to increase chemical fertilizers. Chemical fertilizers are highly effective. I can give an example: Before I came to Beijing to attend the meeting, I went to the Baoding Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Farm to take a look. The farm planted more than 100 mu of wheat, and used 15 jin of chemical fertilizer and about 2,000 jin of coarse manure per mu, and watered it 5 times. The wheat grew very well, and it is expected to harvest about 500 jin per mu. The wheat in some nearby agricultural cooperatives, which is also irrigated land and applies seven or eight thousand jin of coarse manure per mu, looks like it will only harvest 200 jin per mu. Deep plowing, close planting and proper management of wheat in agricultural and animal husbandry farms are certainly also reasons for the increase in production. But the role of chemical fertilizer is extremely obvious. At present, the national supply of chemical fertilizer is far from the actual needs, especially the cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province feel more lacking. I hope that in addition to continuing to accelerate the production of chemical fertilizers, the state will give necessary consideration when allocating the existing chemical fertilizers, according to the needs of cotton and grain increase in Hebei Province.

Fellow representatives, the construction of our great motherland is leaping forward, and the country's first five-year plan will be completed ahead of schedule. Let us move towards a better socialist society with firm confidence and unparalleled excitement!

    河北的公路建设和公路运输
    ——高树勋代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告和廖鲁言部长的说明。
    今年国家的预算，就是在优先发展重工业的同时，农业、轻工业、交通运输业和文化科学事业的投资适当加大了，国防建设投资的比重减少了。这有力地表达了整个国家建设面貌和国家对人民生活的无比关怀，同时也反映了我国人民的和平愿望和国防力量的壮大。我们将要通过的高级农业合作社示范章程（草案），是广大农村建设社会主义社会的法规，有了它，就能够保证农业合作化运动更加迅速地发展与提高。我建议大会通过国家预、决算报告和高级农业合作社示范章程（草案）。
    现在，我就河北省公路建设和公路运输方面的某些情况，发表一下意见。
    新中国成立以来，河北省的公路建设和公路运输事业，有一定的发展。1949年，全省只有公路4，204公里，经过几年的整修与新建，到1955年达到8，653公里，增加了1倍以上。国营营运汽车，1949年只130部，1955年则为723部，增加了4倍半。随着公路和运输工具的增长，到1955年底，全省已建立了运输站336处。自从学习毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示以后，批判了工作中的右倾保守思想，根据“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，制订了地方交通建设的全面规划，充分发挥了群众的积极性，公路和公路运输有更大的发展，今年1至5月份，共改善土路面866公里，新建与改建了简易公路2，426公里，并且有重点的整修了一些大车路与驮运路。私营运输业的社会主义改造，也取得重大胜利，所有的私营汽车已全部实行了公私合营，专营运输的私人马车，除转入农业合作社的以外，95％以上都参加了运输合作社。在国营运输部门，以“安全、节约、10万公里无大修运动”和先进生产者运动为主要内容的社会主义竞赛已推向高潮，经营管理水平正在迅速提高。
    这些成绩是应当肯定的，但是，如果从当前整个国民经济发展的需要来看，河北省的公路建设和公路运输事业还是很落后的。
    在公路建设方面，最主要的问题是现有的公路质量低。河北省原有的公路，大部分是日伪统治时期为了掠夺与残杀人民而修建的，不但分布极不合理，而且根本谈不上什么正规的标准，加以战争破坏，年久失修，到解放初期已残破不堪。全省人民在党和政府的领导下，采取了重点整修、加强养护、提高质量的办法，使大部公路恢复通车。近年来，根据“依靠群众、就地取材、因地制宜、适用经济”的原则，又新建与改建了不少公路。公路建设的发展，对促进城乡物资交流，支持工农业增产，起了积极的作用。但是，一方面由于平时养护不够，形成了随修随坏；而另一方面，河北省的公路多分布在平原地区，因为缺乏改善路面所需要的大量材料，尽管每年春秋两季都要发动大量民工进行普修，但只能加高加宽路基，却无法从根本上提高公路的质量。从表面上看全省有公路8，653里，实际上能够晴雨通车的只有5％，其余都是晴通雨阻甚至雨季长期不能通车的土路。例如：保（定）沧（县）、邯（郸）临（清）、石（家庄）南（宫）德（州）这3条公路都是横贯全省棉、粮产区的交通干线，运输量很大；可是每到雨季，便陷于瘫痪。石家庄、保定等城市每到雨季汽车就不能出城，与农村完全隔绝。这种状况，不但加重了运输上的季节性和突击性，影响物资交流，而且使部队行动不便。山区道路，几年来结合山区建设工作的开展也重点的进行了改善，但大部分仍处于自然状态，交通极为不便。
    根据以上情况，我认为：首先必须改进交通工作，充分依靠群众。在历年的公路建设中，广大群众都表现了极大的积极性和创造性。就从今年1至5月份修路情况看，全省参加修路的民工就有300多万个工日，40多万个车日；许多农业社已经组成修路代表队，实行分段包修包养；为了改善路面，群众搜集了砂、石、炉渣等各种硬质材料78万多立方公尺；在铺筑路面的操作技术方面，群众还创造了“耕犁拌和法”，使工作效率和质量大大提高。这些事实说明：依靠与发动群众，就能够把公路修得更好一些。但是，要把许多的土路从质量上加以提高，达到晴雨通车或常年通车的水平，就需要有大量的硬质材料。而省内资金不足，很难解决，希望国家在可能的范围内给予适当投资。其次，为了把养路工作作得更好一些。必须把养路费基本上用到养路方面。目前，由于中央有关部门对养路费控制过严，其他投资又很少，常常把养路费用于基本建设，这对公路的养护是有影响的。此外，国道与省道的范围也应当明确划分，以利管理和养护。
    在公路运输方面，当前最主要的问题是运输力不足。河北省的近代化运输工具不但数量少，而且大部分是车破机器老，运输效率低。历年来主要是依靠民间畜力车辆完成任务。据去年的统计，在公路运输总转量中，汽车运输只占16％，畜力车辆占84％。今年以来，随着社会主义革命的高潮，运输任务空前繁重，而原来从事运输的畜力车辆，却有60％转向了农业生产。因此，造成了物资积压的严重局面，使国家建设和人民的生产、生活受到很大影响。
    为了迅速地改变这种局面，我们主要采取了以下措施：第一、努力改进国营、公私合营和合作社营的车辆的经营方法，挖掘潜力；加强了运输市场的组织管理，统一调度运输工具，克服运输中的不平衡现象。第二、结合农业合作社开展副业生产，大力组织他们参加运输，特别是组织那些原来以运输为主的车辆参加运输。不久以前，我到通县、唐山、天津等地区检查工作时，看到不少运输部门与农业合作社订立了运输合同，采取定期定量、分片包干的办法进行运输，既能完成一部分运输任务，又增加了农业社的收入。但是，也有必要指出：缺乏运输工具的现象并未完全消除。因此，从发展的需要来看，国家应当设法增加一定数量的汽车，以便彻底改变运输工作的被动落后局面。
    此外，我还想附带着在化学肥料的供应上说几句话。
    河北省盛产棉花，缺乏粮食；棉花年产量占全国四分之一以上，粮食每年要依靠国家拨给数十亿斤，若使河北省棉花产得更多，粮食能够自足，就要提高单位面积产量。提高棉、粮产量措施之一，是多施肥料。解决肥料问题，一方面是发动农民多积粗肥；另一方面也需要增加化学肥料。化学肥料效能高。我可举个例子：我来京开会前，到保定农业畜牧场看了看。该场种了100多亩小麦，每亩用了15斤化学肥料和2，000斤左右的粗肥，浇了5次水，小麦长得很好，预计每亩能收500斤左右。而附近一些农业合作社的小麦，同样是水浇地并且每亩上了七、八千斤粗肥，看样子每亩不过收200斤。农业畜牧场的小麦，深耕、密植与管理得当固然也是增产的原因。但化学肥料的作用是极为明显的。目前国家化学肥料的供应与实际需要距离很远，特别是河北省产棉区更感缺少。希望国家除了继续加速化学肥料生产外，根据河北省棉、粮增产的需要，在分配现有的化学肥料时，予以必要的照顾。
    各位代表，我们伟大祖国建设事业在飞跃的前进着，国家第一个五年计划将要提前完成，让我们满怀着坚定的信心和无比的兴奋，朝着美好的社会主义社会前进！
