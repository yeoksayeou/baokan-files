    The First Batch of Installation Workers Arrive at the Construction Site

    The first batch of workers supporting the equipment installation work for the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant arrived at the construction site from Shanghai in early June.

    Upon arriving at the tractor factory construction site and witnessing the magnificent construction project, they were all very excited and pledged to diligently complete the machine installation tasks.

    The China National Machine & Electrical Equipment Installation Corporation, which is contracted to install the equipment at the tractor factory, has made proper arrangements for the new workers and assigned dedicated personnel to assist them in studying politics and technology, so that they can quickly master their skills.

    A Batch of Foremen Return from the Soviet Union

    The first batch of twelve foremen sent by the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant to the Soviet Union for training have completed their studies and returned to China. They will be assigned to work in the carpentry shop, forging shop, and some workshops in the tractor shop. During their internship in the Soviet Union, they became familiar with the technological processes of their respective trades and can operate independently.

    Now, these returned foremen are actively preparing for production to strive for the early production of tractors. Some are familiarizing themselves with the machine equipment, while others are imparting the advanced techniques they learned from the Soviet Union.

    More Than Half of the Main Factory Buildings Complete Exterior Construction

    Luoyang, June 26 (By our own correspondent) - At the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant under construction in Luoyang, more than half of the main factory buildings have now completed their exterior construction. Among the eleven main factory buildings in the entire plant, six large factory buildings, including the forging shop, non-ferrous casting shop, auxiliary shop, engine shop, carpentry shop, and stamping shop, have been completed. The tall bodies of these factory buildings have already stood on the factory area base covering hundreds of thousands of square meters. Construction of the fuel system shop also began on May 31. The hub for supplying power to the entire plant—the gas station, oxygen station, acetylene station, as well as the building materials warehouse and central laboratory—have also been completed or are nearing completion. The wide central avenue, crisscrossing roads, and complex underground pipeline projects within the factory area have all been completed or more than 90% completed. The commencement and completion dates of the major projects among these have been advanced by two to three months compared to the original plan.

    All the workers constructing the tractor factory are confidently welcoming the commencement of the factory building projects for the steel casting, iron casting, and standard metal parts workshops. It is estimated that the exterior construction of the main factory buildings of the entire plant can be basically completed within this year.

    Full-Scale Construction of the Fuel System Shop Factory Building Project

    The workers constructing the fuel system shop of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant have learned from the experience of the brother work areas in completing the exterior of the engine shop factory building in thirty-eight working days and decided to complete the exterior of the factory building in thirty-six working days. Now, they have started full-scale construction according to the plan.

    While preparing the construction organization design and work plan, the construction unit of this workshop has also made thorough arrangements for the connection and coordination of each process, and decided to promote more than a dozen key advanced experiences, such as dry-hard concrete and mechanical surface compaction, during the construction process. The workers' enthusiasm for labor is very high, and many teams are constantly exceeding the engineering quotas. The Zhao Arong team exceeded the quota by 60.3% in the first two days of excavating the foundation earthwork.

    The fuel system shop is an important component of the tractor factory. After its completion, it will produce a large number of important parts for diesel engines every year, such as high-pressure oil pump governors and fuel injectors.

    Massive Training of Technical Workers

    Thirty-two factories in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places are training nearly two thousand technical workers for the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

    Most of these people are apprentices, as well as workers ranging from level two to level eight. They have received enthusiastic help from the workers of various factories in their studies, and most of them have quickly improved their technical level. Fan Yanling, an old worker from a factory in Shanghai, actively taught apprentices technical skills even during his rest time. Zhou Debiao, a level three worker, reached level five in eight months with his help.

    Workers March Towards Science

    In the mornings of summer at the First Tractor Factory, it is common to see people reciting Russian; at night, the lights in the offices are bright, and almost everyone is working on algebra, geometry, or self-studying English. The workers of the tractor factory are marching towards science, marching towards culture! A total of more than seven hundred people in the entire plant are participating in such spare-time cultural studies. Among them are cadres at the level of factory director, division chief, and section chief, as well as veteran comrades who have participated in the revolution for many years. Over the past year, they have studied diligently and made rapid progress.

    第一拖拉机厂的建设在前进中
    首批安装工人到达工地
    支援第一拖拉机制造厂设备安装工作的第一批工人，在六月初旬由上海到达工地。
    他们到达拖拉机厂工地以后，看到拖拉机厂壮丽的建设工程，都非常兴奋，纷纷保证要努力完成机器安装任务。
    承包拖拉机厂设备安装工程的机电安装公司，已经对新来的工人们进行了妥善的安置，并且指定专人帮助他们学习政治、技术，以便他们能迅速地掌握业务。一批工段长从苏联归来
    第一拖拉机制造厂派往苏联实习的第一批工段长十二人已经结业回国。他们将分别担任木工场、锻工场、拖拉机工场一些车间里的部分工作。他们在苏联实习的过程中，熟悉了本工种的工艺过程，可以独立进行操作。
    现在，这些回国的工段长们，正在积极进行争取提前出产拖拉机的生产准备工作。他们有的在熟悉机器设备情况，有的在传授从苏联学来的先进技术。半数以上的主厂房完成外型工程
    本报洛阳26日电　建设在洛阳的第一拖拉机制造厂，目前已经有半数以上的主厂房完成了厂房外型工程。全厂十一个主厂房中，有锻工场、有色修铸工场、辅助工场、发动机工场、木工场、冲压工场六个大型厂房已经建成。这些厂房的高大的屋身，已经屹立在纵横数十万平方公尺的厂区基地上。燃料系统工场，也在五月三十一日开始施工。给全厂输送动力的枢纽——煤气站、氧气站、乙炔站和建筑材料仓库、中央实验室等建筑物，也已经建成或将近竣工。厂区内宽阔的中央大道、纵横交错的马路，以及地下的复杂的管道工程，都已经完成或完成了90％以上。这些工程中主要项目的开工和完工期限，都比原计划提前两三个月。
    修建拖拉机厂的全体职工都满怀信心地迎接铸钢、铸铁、标准金属零件等工场的厂房工程的开工。预计全厂的主厂房外型建筑工程，在今年内可以基本完成。燃料系统工场厂房工程全面施工
    修建第一拖拉机制造厂燃料系统工场的职工们，吸取了兄弟工区在三十八个工作日内建成发动机工场厂房外型的经验，决定在三十六个工作日内完成厂房外型工程。现在，他们已经按照计划进行全面施工。
    这个工场的施工单位在编好施工组织设计和作业计划的同时，对各个工序的衔接和配合都作了周密的安排，并且决定在施工过程中推广干硬性混凝土、机械表面夯实等十几种关键性的先进经验。职工们的劳动热情非常高涨，许多小组不断突破工程定额。赵阿龙小组在开挖基础土方工程中，头两天就超过定额60.3％。
    燃料系统工场是拖拉机厂的一个重要组成部分。它在建成以后，每年要生产大量柴油发动机上的重要部件——高压油泵调速器和喷油嘴等。大量培养技术工人
    北京、上海、天津、武汉等地有三十二个工厂正在为第一拖拉机制造厂培养和训练近两千名技术工人。
    这些人多半是徒工，还有二级以上到八级以下的工人。他们在学习中得到了各厂职工的热心帮助，大都很快地提高了技术水平。上海一个工厂的老工人樊延龄在休息时间也积极教学员学技术，三级工周德标就是在他的帮助下，在八个月内达到了五级工的水平。职工们向科学进军
    夏天的早晨，在第一拖拉机厂里，经常可以看到有人在朗诵俄文；夜晚，办公室里灯光明亮，差不多每一张桌子面前都有人在演算代数、几何，或者自修英文。拖拉机厂的职工们在向科学进军，向文化进军！全厂参加这样的业余文化学习的共有七百多人。其中有厂长、处长、科长级的干部，有参加革命多年的老同志。一年来，他们认真学习，进步很快。
