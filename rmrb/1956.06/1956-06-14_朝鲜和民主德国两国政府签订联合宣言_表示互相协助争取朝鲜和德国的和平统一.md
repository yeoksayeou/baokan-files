    朝鲜和民主德国两国政府签订联合宣言
    表示互相协助争取朝鲜和德国的和平统一
    新华社柏林13日电　朝鲜政府代表团和民主德国政府的会谈已经结束，双方于六月十二日在柏林签订了两国政府联合宣言。此外还签订了经济文化合作协定和广播事业合作协定。
    两国政府在联合宣言中表示欢迎国际紧张局势的缓和，并且重申要共同致力于进一步促进这种缓和。两国政府要求无条件禁止生产和使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。它们认为，各国就裁军问题达成协议将有助于国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，有助于加强和平以及在民主的基础上实现德国和朝鲜的和平统一。
    两国政府指出，西德的重新军国主义化和把它拖入北大西洋公约是德国恢复统一的障碍，同样，南朝鲜的加紧武装，也是恢复朝鲜统一的障碍。宣言中强调说，西德和南朝鲜的这种发展是对欧洲和亚洲和平的威胁。
    两国政府认为，西德的军国主义必须消除，西德必须退出北大西洋公约，欧洲必须建立有效的集体安全体系。
    为了和平解决朝鲜问题，两国政府认为，应当由南北朝鲜声明，它们将不采取军事行动反对对方，必须使南北朝鲜的军队人数缩减到最低限度，必须立即并且同时地从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队。
    宣言还强调指出，必须使各方都遵守朝鲜停战协定，让中立国监察委员会继续活动。
    两国政府表示忠实于和平共处原则，认为这种原则是国际关系的基础。
    两国政府一致认为：包括德意志民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在内的国家不被接纳为联合国会员国的情况，是同联合国宪章相抵触的。两国政府主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。
    最后，两国政府表示努力争取和平统一德国和朝鲜的坚定不移的决心，表示愿意协助这一斗争。
